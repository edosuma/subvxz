00:00.901 --> 00:02.070
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.103 --> 00:05.139
- What did Eddie want with you?
- Mom, please, look at me.

00:05.173 --> 00:06.207
- I need you to go.

00:06.240 --> 00:08.209
- How long?
- 15 years.

00:08.242 --> 00:11.045
- Our daughter...
- I want to see her.

00:11.079 --> 00:13.647
I'm climbing the rungs
with Richard and Felicia,

00:13.681 --> 00:17.385
and when I am ready,
I am going to replace Cal.

00:17.418 --> 00:18.752
- You have to let me go.

00:18.786 --> 00:20.821
- I can't do that.
- You have to.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.756
- I am not cut out
for this, Richard!

00:22.790 --> 00:25.359
I don't want the responsibility
of other people's lives!

00:25.393 --> 00:27.161
I can barely deal with my own!

00:27.195 --> 00:29.363
Cal offered us a house
if I broke up with you?

00:29.397 --> 00:30.798
- Why would Cal do that?

00:30.831 --> 00:32.766
Because he didn't want
to lose you.

00:32.800 --> 00:34.635
I willingly missed restitution.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.470
I need to cleanse.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.509
Can you find a way to get Mary

00:41.542 --> 00:43.444
to sit down with Wendy
this afternoon?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.446
We can have
a life somewhere else.

00:45.479 --> 00:48.116
- And if I don't want to go,
will you go without me?

00:48.149 --> 00:51.385
"I relinquish my guilt
for being with Cal.

00:51.419 --> 00:54.155
"Everything else I've done
that is horrible this year

00:54.188 --> 00:55.456
I'll hold on to."

00:55.489 --> 00:56.724
- Forgive me.

00:56.757 --> 01:00.261

01:41.669 --> 01:43.204
I-I can't see you anymore.

01:43.237 --> 01:44.538
Your father stopped believing.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.707
You are not ascending
anything, Hawk,

01:46.740 --> 01:49.343
because there is no ladder
to ascend.

01:49.377 --> 01:51.679
You need to learn
to channel some of that anger

01:51.712 --> 01:53.181
into the world.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.682
I was just like you as a kid.

01:54.715 --> 01:57.185
I cannot lose you.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.686
I told you,
I can't do this anymore.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.488
He doesn't want to talk to you.

02:00.521 --> 02:01.765
If you say you floated,
you floated.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.557
Are you spending
more time with Cal?

02:03.591 --> 02:04.901
- He can help me.
- Is that what he told you?

02:04.925 --> 02:06.460
He's nothing like you.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.696
And you should see your father.
He loves you.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.699
But I am still
your father, Hawk.

02:11.732 --> 02:14.368
I am still your father, Hawk.

02:14.402 --> 02:17.871
- Tell my dad I want to see him.

02:24.412 --> 02:27.881
- It seems our luck's changing.

02:27.915 --> 02:31.719
They loved us
at the World Faith Conference.

02:31.752 --> 02:34.522
Our energy, our, uh...

02:34.555 --> 02:35.889
our message.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.658
- That's wonderful.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.762
It's complicated, you know,

02:41.795 --> 02:44.665
because of my kids.

02:44.698 --> 02:48.536
You know, Hawk seems
to really be struggling again,

02:48.569 --> 02:51.205
and...

02:51.239 --> 02:53.874
I don't know how much more
he can handle.

02:53.907 --> 02:56.944
- Sarah, I, um...
- You know, I understand...

02:59.247 --> 03:01.315
Completely.

03:01.349 --> 03:04.218
But, um...

03:04.252 --> 03:07.388
I need you to know that...

03:07.421 --> 03:10.391
I'm in.

03:10.424 --> 03:12.360
I'm all-in.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.380
Hey, great work
on that landscaping, Aaron.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.881
- Thanks, Cal.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.716
- I saw those
new pamphlets, Luis.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.017
They look good.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.619
- Good for you.

03:44.592 --> 03:46.460
- Hey.
- Hi, Cal.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.366
Eddie.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.001
What...

03:54.034 --> 03:55.703
- I know.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.272
Aah! I know
about you and Sarah.

03:58.306 --> 04:02.376
All these years, pining for her,

04:02.410 --> 04:03.877
and you finally got
what you wanted.

04:03.911 --> 04:06.380
- You really gonna do this, hmm?

04:06.414 --> 04:08.949
In my house?

04:08.982 --> 04:10.551
- You're a Denier, Eddie.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.386
I say the word,
there'll be 20 kids in here

04:12.420 --> 04:14.822
to throw you on the street
in a second.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.690
- You're pathetic.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.362
- We never meant to hurt you.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.567
- Are you fucking serious?

04:26.600 --> 04:28.035
Listen to me.

04:28.068 --> 04:31.004
She may have settled for you,

04:31.038 --> 04:35.376
but she chose me...

04:35.409 --> 04:38.679
just like Steve.

04:40.948 --> 04:44.352
You know, he said
you were a disappointment.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.520
- How did you get that?
- It doesn't belong to you.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.556
- See, that's where...

04:48.589 --> 04:51.024
you're wrong.

04:51.058 --> 04:54.628
I was with Steve when he died,

04:54.662 --> 04:57.030
and he told me

04:57.064 --> 04:59.733
that he put his faith

04:59.767 --> 05:02.736
in the wrong man.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.905
- You... you... you were not
with him.

05:04.938 --> 05:08.041
- Oh, but I was.

05:08.075 --> 05:12.746
And you think
that I can't touch you?

05:12.780 --> 05:14.748
No, you can't touch me, asshole,

05:14.782 --> 05:18.018
because I am the one.

05:18.051 --> 05:22.890
I say the word, and those
20 kids will throw you out...

05:22.923 --> 05:27.695
because I am
the fucking chosen son, Cal.

05:40.173 --> 05:45.413
*

05:45.446 --> 05:48.582
Is there a threat
of danger if you try to leave?

05:48.616 --> 05:52.052
- I don't know anyone
who's tried.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.054
Eddie Lane.

05:54.087 --> 05:56.056
- Eddie Lane didn't leave.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.025
He was kicked out.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.561
Sean's dad and I can...

06:00.594 --> 06:03.030
Want to take care of you.

06:03.063 --> 06:06.567
We can buy you a house,
put it in your names.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.402
We want you both safe

06:08.436 --> 06:13.006
and this child to be born free
of this movement.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.578
- You haven't asked what I want.

06:17.611 --> 06:22.049
- Babe, this is
a second chance for us.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.756
*

06:31.625 --> 06:33.060
- I don't know
about you being off

06:33.093 --> 06:34.762
with all those
whoo-whoo hippies.

06:34.795 --> 06:36.129
I miss you, man.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.065
My heart chakra's
all janky and shit.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.133
- Oh, please, man.
- I might be back soon.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.869
- You got them on lock?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.905
- Well, four of Sarah Lane's
blackmail victims

06:44.938 --> 06:48.909
are being teed up
to be deposed by Penetti.

06:48.942 --> 06:52.212
There is no way a grand jury
won't indict.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.123
- You're not out of the woods
when you get to a grand jury.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.949
No telling what they'll do.

06:55.983 --> 06:57.861
- Oh, no, we'll get there
with something that sticks.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.488
The press alone
will torpedo The Movement.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.857
Now, one way or another,
Sarah Lane is going to jail.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.560
- Special Agent Gaines?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.935
They're the water results
you asked for.

07:14.968 --> 07:16.904
You mean the water results

07:16.937 --> 07:19.439
you were ordered not to run.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.814
You went against orders.
Why?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.917
- The way the top brass shut
this down didn't sit right.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.752
And my mom grew up in that town,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.754
died at 45... cancer.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.055
I always wondered.

07:35.088 --> 07:36.890
Now I know.

07:40.961 --> 07:47.901
*

07:53.974 --> 07:57.611
- I need you to get a message
to Hawk for me.

07:57.645 --> 08:01.114
Tell him it's time
that we see each other.

08:03.116 --> 08:05.052
I'll be waiting.

08:05.085 --> 08:09.590
*

08:09.623 --> 08:12.593
- Why aren't you coming?
- The others are on their way.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.763
- I'm sorry, but I just found
out that Hawk's not doing well.

08:15.796 --> 08:17.931
I'm on my way to see him now.

08:17.965 --> 08:20.133
What's the meeting about,
anyway?

08:20.167 --> 08:22.069
- I wanted to tell you
in person.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.237
- Well, what is it, Cal?

08:24.271 --> 08:25.773
- Eddie was here.

08:25.806 --> 08:27.941
He... he knows about us.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.843
- How?

08:29.877 --> 08:31.855
- No... well, I don't...
- I don't know. I don't know yet.

08:31.879 --> 08:35.783
He was... he was
out of his mind, Sarah.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.085
- Oh, my God.
- Of course he was.

08:38.118 --> 08:41.254
I'm sure he's so hurt...
furious.

08:41.288 --> 08:44.024
- No, no, no, this was more,
like, delusional...

08:44.057 --> 08:47.127
Shouting about how he was
with Steve when he died.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.563
- He went to Peru...

08:49.597 --> 08:52.766
right before Steve became one
with The Light.

08:52.800 --> 08:54.935
- Wait.

08:54.968 --> 08:59.773
So he talked to Steve
and... and...

08:59.807 --> 09:01.174
what, and you knew?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.777
- No, no, no, all I know
is that he went to Cusco.

09:03.811 --> 09:05.245
That's all he told me.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.047
What... what I want to know

09:07.080 --> 09:09.082
is how he found out about us.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.885
- I don't know yet.

09:11.919 --> 09:14.922
Um, everyone who could make it
is here, so...

09:14.955 --> 09:17.758
Um, we'll talk about this later.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.261
- Oh, my God.

09:26.299 --> 09:27.939
- You've reached Eddie.
- Leave a message.

09:27.968 --> 09:29.236
- Eddie...

09:29.269 --> 09:31.071
please, I need to talk to you.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.611
*

09:37.645 --> 09:38.779
Oh, my God.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.818
- Eddie Lane,
many of you know well,

09:44.852 --> 09:47.054
breached our security
this morning.

09:47.087 --> 09:51.158
I called you all here
to stress the importance

09:51.191 --> 09:54.828
of such an incident never being
allowed to happen again.

09:54.862 --> 09:57.698
Now... Um...

09:57.731 --> 09:59.833
You know, Carlos, explain to us

09:59.867 --> 10:03.136
how you allowed it to happen
in the first place.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.006
- Look, I can't...

10:06.039 --> 10:07.975
He must've slithered in
when I wasn't...

10:08.008 --> 10:10.243
- I can't really...
- That is unacceptable!

10:10.277 --> 10:15.148
What good are our new protocols,
new identification,

10:15.182 --> 10:17.951
perimeter checks if someone
can easily walk in

10:17.985 --> 10:20.754
and... and compromise our safety,

10:20.788 --> 10:23.223
let alone a Denier
who is dangerous,

10:23.256 --> 10:27.094
imbalanced, and... and desperate
to hurt us?

10:27.127 --> 10:31.198
We must take accountability
for our actions.

10:31.231 --> 10:35.736
If we shirk our duties,
if we disregard our policies,

10:35.769 --> 10:40.674
then we must hold ourselves
accountable.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.778
We have to look out
for each other.

10:44.812 --> 10:46.980
Right?

10:47.014 --> 10:51.151
Keep each other safe.

10:51.184 --> 10:53.453
That is our responsibility.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.222
That is our privilege...

10:55.255 --> 10:58.759
As those blessed by The Light,

10:58.792 --> 11:02.963
as those worthy of The Light.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.666
All right.

11:37.865 --> 11:40.333
- I heard.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.935
Are you all right?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.807
I know this isn't easy.

11:48.876 --> 11:52.846
- I haven't seen anyone
for days.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.514
- By being alone
with your thoughts,

11:54.547 --> 11:56.850
you're better able to focus,

11:56.884 --> 12:00.187
hone in on the root
of your transgression

12:00.220 --> 12:04.825
and figure out how you can tear
that root out.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.359
- What if it doesn't work?

12:06.393 --> 12:08.762
- It takes time.

12:08.796 --> 12:11.064
When you get out,
return to your daily life,

12:11.098 --> 12:14.501
the effects of the meditation
will take hold.

12:18.538 --> 12:20.841
- It didn't work for Dad.

12:20.874 --> 12:24.177
- I read
your unburdening report.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.848
I know that you were
with Ashley.

12:27.881 --> 12:30.150
Is there anything else?

12:30.183 --> 12:32.285
Have you seen your dad lately?

12:35.322 --> 12:42.262
*

12:45.232 --> 12:49.036
It's one more night.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.372
And you are not
your father, Hawk.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.843
*

12:55.876 --> 12:59.346
The Light radiates in you.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.852
*

13:04.885 --> 13:06.053
- Kneel.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.856
The key to mending

13:08.889 --> 13:13.526
is forgiveness
and specificity...

13:13.560 --> 13:15.996
precision.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.534
When someone says...

13:24.404 --> 13:29.176
"If I've ever done anything
to hurt you, I'm sorry"...

13:31.578 --> 13:35.849
It's not a mending,
but an equivocation.

13:38.886 --> 13:41.354
- Resentment...

13:41.388 --> 13:44.357
and vagueness...

13:44.391 --> 13:46.860
are what darkness and disease

13:46.894 --> 13:50.330
feed and flourish on.

13:52.565 --> 13:55.535
You only need to open yourself

13:55.568 --> 13:58.605
as wide as the eye of a needle.

13:58.638 --> 14:02.842
That is room enough
for The Light to enter you...

14:04.244 --> 14:06.046
To forgive you...

14:07.915 --> 14:10.183
And mend your wounds.

14:13.921 --> 14:18.525
Threading this needle without
your eyes to guide you...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.097
Is easier than finding your way

14:24.131 --> 14:26.666
to real and lasting forgiveness

14:26.699 --> 14:29.336
of those who have harmed you.

14:37.077 --> 14:40.680
You have done so much harm
to yourself...

14:40.713 --> 14:44.017
more so than anyone else.

14:48.421 --> 14:52.225
8R requires
your rigorous honesty,

14:52.259 --> 14:53.693
your humility,

14:53.726 --> 14:57.397
your patience, your diligence.

14:57.430 --> 15:03.670
*

15:07.240 --> 15:09.209
- You've reached Eddie.
- Leave a message.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.213
Stay close to The Light,

15:13.246 --> 15:18.051
and The Light will provide you
with everything you need.

15:18.085 --> 15:22.055
Of your own volition,
you can't overcome your fear

15:22.089 --> 15:26.393
when it conspires
with your pride...

15:26.426 --> 15:29.562
or your mute darkness...

15:29.596 --> 15:32.199
or your willful denial.

15:34.101 --> 15:37.971
These obstacles to forgiveness

15:38.005 --> 15:40.407
are harder to overcome.

15:40.440 --> 15:44.377
But to overcome them

15:44.411 --> 15:49.182
is to know
The Light's abiding love.

15:49.216 --> 15:56.156
*

16:18.111 --> 16:21.381
- You haven't wanted
to talk much today.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.517
May I make an observation?

16:24.551 --> 16:26.519
Something's eating at you.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.521
- I heard about Eddie.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.324
- What did you hear?

16:31.358 --> 16:33.226
- That he stormed
into the center in New York

16:33.260 --> 16:34.561
and threatened Cal.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.396
Why did he do that?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.399
- You know, these sessions are
about you and your child.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.202
How does that question pertain

16:42.235 --> 16:44.571
to your unborn child?

16:44.604 --> 16:47.374
- Did the outside world
make him crazy?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.710
- Are you thinking
about the outside world?

16:50.743 --> 16:54.414
- Sean's parents
want us to leave.

16:54.447 --> 16:56.416
They've offered
to buy us a house,

16:56.449 --> 16:58.585
set us up with a life.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.553
- I see.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.693
Well, what do you want, Mary?

17:10.262 --> 17:14.401
- You've blossomed
into a beautiful woman,

17:14.434 --> 17:17.237
an example others look to.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.239
It's true.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.241
I know it's hard
for you to look at yourself

17:21.273 --> 17:22.709
and see the power in you,

17:22.742 --> 17:24.577
but I see it,

17:24.611 --> 17:27.714
and you're radiant.

17:27.747 --> 17:32.352
But the IS world still has all
the things that you ran from.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.254
So I want you to think hard

17:34.287 --> 17:36.723
about the world
you'd be returning to.

17:36.756 --> 17:39.092
And you have to make
the decision here.

17:39.126 --> 17:40.593
I can't make it for you,

17:40.627 --> 17:44.131
and neither can Sean
or his parents.

17:44.164 --> 17:47.400
You need to make the right
decision for you and your baby.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.374
Is there something else?

17:57.410 --> 17:58.645
*

17:58.678 --> 18:00.480
Something here?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.249
Someone?

18:02.282 --> 18:04.717
*

18:04.751 --> 18:06.719
The person,
the man that you think

18:06.753 --> 18:08.888
might be the father
of your child?

18:08.921 --> 18:10.390
*

18:10.423 --> 18:12.559
- Sean needs to get
away from him.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.594
- Who is that man?

18:14.627 --> 18:16.329
- I can't tell you.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.465
- Can't or won't?

18:18.498 --> 18:20.300
*

18:20.333 --> 18:23.170
I can't help you
if you don't talk to me, Mary.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.438
That's why we're transparent.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.440
- Yeah, except all of you
believe in it,

18:27.474 --> 18:30.410
but no one really practices it.

18:30.443 --> 18:37.417
*

18:44.457 --> 18:47.894
- Oh, hey.
- Um, I was just...

18:47.927 --> 18:51.231
I left my shirt here,
my favorite shirt.

19:05.478 --> 19:08.448
Thanks.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.583
I guess I'll see you around.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.723
- S-stay.

19:16.756 --> 19:18.325
I want you to.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.794
- You don't owe me
an explanation.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.696
- I was with my ex.

19:25.298 --> 19:28.568
- The girl we saw that night?
- Yeah.

19:28.601 --> 19:30.603
- It's fine.

19:30.637 --> 19:33.740
I mean, it's not really fine.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.608
You did take me home
to meet your family.

19:35.642 --> 19:38.811
- That usually means something.
- It does.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.895
I get it.

19:55.928 --> 20:00.267
We're bound to mess up
once in a while.

20:00.300 --> 20:01.601
I have a head case of a mom,

20:01.634 --> 20:03.370
and after seeing
what your dad's like,

20:03.403 --> 20:06.439
it's a shocker
we don't mess up more often.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.907
- You saw my dad?

20:07.940 --> 20:09.476
- Yeah, he was here.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.911
I thought
you would've heard already.

20:11.944 --> 20:14.714
He bum-rushed Cal
in his office.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.452
- I...

20:19.486 --> 20:21.354
I don't know what to do.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.022
- Let them hash it out.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.724
- No, I-I just...

20:24.757 --> 20:27.627
In the program, I was thinking
about him a lot, and...

20:27.660 --> 20:29.762
now he really wants to see me.

20:29.796 --> 20:32.565
And it's just...

20:32.599 --> 20:35.502
Meditation's supposed to help
you find clarity, and...

20:37.770 --> 20:39.406
I'm, uh...

20:40.940 --> 20:44.411
Just all messed up again.

20:44.444 --> 20:45.912
Sorry.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.047
Have you heard
anything more about Eddie...

20:48.080 --> 20:49.749
How he might've found out?

20:49.782 --> 20:52.285
- No, I haven't. I'm sorry.

20:52.319 --> 20:53.620
- I've been calling him,

20:53.653 --> 20:55.788
and he keeps sending me
to voice mail, so...

20:55.822 --> 20:58.558
- I guess he doesn't want
to talk to you.

20:58.591 --> 21:01.894
Sorry.
Uh, I just, um...

21:04.797 --> 21:07.800
Talking to him
isn't gonna help anything.

21:07.834 --> 21:12.472
It's about us now and everything
we're gonna build here...

21:12.505 --> 21:14.474
together.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.610
That's a fact he has to work
through in his own way.

21:17.644 --> 21:18.911
Let him do that.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.916
- Mary told me
during session today

21:23.950 --> 21:27.387
that she and Sean are thinking
about leaving.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.088
- Huh.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.624
- I get the feeling that they're
running from someone,

21:31.658 --> 21:33.460
but she won't say who.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.628
- We can't let
someone intimidate her.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.464
- Well, as her guide,

21:37.497 --> 21:40.767
I can't betray her confidence,
but I am concerned.

21:40.800 --> 21:43.770
If someone here is...

21:43.803 --> 21:46.473
Girls like her draw men in

21:46.506 --> 21:48.941
who re-create
their original damage,

21:48.975 --> 21:51.478
men who were once victims before

21:51.511 --> 21:55.081
and have since become...

21:55.114 --> 21:56.716
- Become what?

21:56.749 --> 21:58.618
- If someone here
is possibly exploiting her,

21:58.651 --> 22:01.754
uh, then it is
our responsibility

22:01.788 --> 22:03.590
to root that out.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.760
- Hmm.
- This has to be a safe place.

22:07.794 --> 22:09.396
- Absolutely.

22:09.429 --> 22:11.464
- I'll, uh, make arrangements

22:11.498 --> 22:13.866
for them to spend time
at the retreat center.

22:13.900 --> 22:15.602
- In her condition?

22:15.635 --> 22:18.638
- Severing the trauma bond
between her and the abuser

22:18.671 --> 22:20.640
are the only way
that she might feel comfortable

22:20.673 --> 22:22.609
revealing his identity.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.844
She has to do this
in order to heal.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.485
- I don't know who that is.

22:32.519 --> 22:34.654
- Hello?
- Hi. This is Noa.

22:34.687 --> 22:37.056
- Oh, hey.
- I don't know if this is...

22:37.089 --> 22:39.526
What the right thing
to do here is,

22:39.559 --> 22:40.693
but I'm worried about Hawk.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.462
His dad is trying
to see him and...

22:42.495 --> 22:44.163
- Uh, can you...
- Can you hold on a sec?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.065
This is something at the center.

22:54.140 --> 22:57.644
*

22:57.677 --> 23:00.947
Hey, Noa.
Uh, you're saying...

23:00.980 --> 23:02.649
Hawk's father contacted him?

23:02.682 --> 23:04.451
- I don't know.
- I guess.

23:04.484 --> 23:06.919
Seeing him at the center gave me
such triggers with my mom

23:06.953 --> 23:09.055
that send me back
to, like, infant state.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.958
And I don't want to betray
his confidence, but I also...

23:11.991 --> 23:14.794
- No, you're doing
the right thing.

23:14.827 --> 23:19.131
Look, it's complicated right now
between Hawk and his father.

23:22.134 --> 23:25.772
*

23:27.139 --> 23:28.841
- Oh, Jesus.

23:28.875 --> 23:34.113
*

23:37.149 --> 23:44.090
*

23:47.527 --> 23:51.130
* Something's gonna kill us

23:51.163 --> 23:53.132
*

23:55.835 --> 24:00.139
* No, nothing's gonna save us

24:00.172 --> 24:03.943
*

24:03.976 --> 24:07.647
* After the blow

24:07.680 --> 24:12.952
*

24:12.985 --> 24:16.122
* It will never be so

24:36.976 --> 24:38.811
- Where's Hawk?

24:38.845 --> 24:40.513
*

24:40.547 --> 24:42.882
Oh, what the fuck is this?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.517
- Take it easy.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.653
- Jesus Christ.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.923
Get the fuck off me!

25:00.232 --> 25:02.669
- Deniers need to stay
where they belong...

25:02.702 --> 25:03.970
In the shadows.

25:06.573 --> 25:11.611
*

25:31.297 --> 25:34.634
S-Sean?

25:34.667 --> 25:36.936
- Stay here.

25:38.304 --> 25:41.641
- Wait. Wait. Um...

25:41.674 --> 25:44.944
I told Sarah
we were thinking of leaving.

25:44.977 --> 25:47.113
- What?
- Why would you do that?

25:47.146 --> 25:48.848
- I-I don't...
- Shit.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.116
- I-I don't... don't know.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.951
- I'm sorry.
- Calm down, calm down.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.064
No one's gonna lay a finger
on us, do you understand?

26:09.135 --> 26:11.771
Hi. I know it's late.
I'm sorry.

26:11.804 --> 26:14.741
Mind if I come in for a second?

26:16.142 --> 26:19.612
Mm.

26:22.148 --> 26:25.785
Sarah told me
you were thinking of leaving.

26:25.818 --> 26:28.655
She's making arrangements
for you to go on retreat.

26:28.688 --> 26:30.666
Most of the time when people
are thinking about leaving,

26:30.690 --> 26:33.926
they return from the retreat
and stay with us.

26:37.163 --> 26:42.068
I wanted to see
if that's what you both want.

26:45.705 --> 26:47.807
This...

26:47.840 --> 26:49.942
This is painful...

26:49.976 --> 26:54.313
to let go of someone you love.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.115
It's excruciating, actually.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.217
Um...

26:58.250 --> 27:02.388
you are loved here...

27:02.421 --> 27:03.790
the two of you.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.792
I hope you know that...

27:05.825 --> 27:07.927
and feel that.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.662
You deserve

27:09.696 --> 27:14.133
the best possible life...

27:14.166 --> 27:17.369
with your child.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.305
And if there's anything I can do

27:19.338 --> 27:21.307
to make the transition
as easy as possible,

27:21.340 --> 27:24.110
please don't...
Don't hesitate to ask.

27:25.912 --> 27:28.915
- That's really, um...

27:28.948 --> 27:31.851
Thanks.

27:35.021 --> 27:40.793
*

27:40.827 --> 27:43.129
I've been rude for long enough.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.297
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.800
Get some sleep.

27:50.837 --> 27:53.139
*

27:53.172 --> 27:55.174
- You okay?

27:55.207 --> 27:58.177
- Yeah, I'm okay.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.348
- I think they're gonna
let us go.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.819
Don't be afraid.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.487
- I'm not.
- Hey...

28:08.520 --> 28:10.156
I, uh...

28:10.189 --> 28:12.124
I came here looking
for a new life,

28:12.158 --> 28:14.827
and I found it with you.

28:14.861 --> 28:17.129
- I found it with you.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.965
- Yeah.

28:18.998 --> 28:25.938
*

28:30.977 --> 28:32.478
Are you gonna clue me in

28:32.511 --> 28:34.380
or treat me
like I'm some bullshit?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.148
- The brother
of Penetti's chief of staff

28:36.182 --> 28:38.484
sits on the board
of DeKaan's company.

28:38.517 --> 28:40.519
- Hmm?
- So?

28:40.552 --> 28:42.822
- So they set me up.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.323
They sent me back in there

28:44.356 --> 28:48.060
because The Movement was causing
trouble for DeKaan...

28:48.094 --> 28:50.963
Penetti's biggest
campaign donor.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.467
The blackmail victims
that I have lined up for Penetti

28:55.501 --> 28:58.470
are pieces of shit...

28:58.504 --> 29:01.140
but none of them are a DeKaan...

29:01.173 --> 29:05.277
Poisoning and killing
entire towns for a buck.

29:10.016 --> 29:12.418
They're playing me, man.

29:12.451 --> 29:14.987
- Are you kidding me?
- Really?

29:15.021 --> 29:17.890
Name me one person
who isn't being played.

29:17.924 --> 29:20.002
- Come on, I'm supposed
to be playing for the good guys.

29:20.026 --> 29:22.161
- Oh, come on, man,
you're supposed to be playing

29:22.194 --> 29:23.996
for the team who's paying you.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.934
Just get me a date.

29:27.967 --> 29:30.136
Don't make me come out
to bumblefuck again.

29:52.191 --> 29:54.994
- What happened to you?

29:56.362 --> 29:59.999
I was set up by Cal.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.835
- Cal wouldn't do that.
- Uh, yes...

30:02.869 --> 30:05.838
yes, he would, and he did.

30:05.872 --> 30:09.008
And I think that maybe...

30:09.041 --> 30:12.178
maybe my own kid
had something to do with it.

30:12.211 --> 30:13.445
- Hawk? No.

30:13.479 --> 30:15.181
He's... he wouldn't...

30:15.214 --> 30:17.616
Why did you come into the center
in New York like that?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.618
You're asking for trouble.

30:19.651 --> 30:21.320
- Ask your daughter.

30:21.353 --> 30:24.123
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Just tell me!

30:24.156 --> 30:25.500
- Is... is Hawk still
in a program?

30:25.524 --> 30:26.993
- He's back at the center.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.628
This is get... I...
It's too...

30:29.661 --> 30:32.231
- I don't like this.
- Look, I know, I know.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.000
That's why I need you
to do something...

30:34.033 --> 30:35.001
- Eddie...
- For me.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.435
- Eddie...

30:36.468 --> 30:39.005
- Look, I know that Gaby
works in the office, okay?

30:39.038 --> 30:41.507
I-I just need the files

30:41.540 --> 30:44.643
for every disgruntled Meyerist
who has ever left...

30:44.676 --> 30:48.514
Every person
who's been labeled a Denier.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.017
- They're watching
everybody right now.

30:51.050 --> 30:52.885
- Just find a way.

30:52.919 --> 30:54.253
- What does Richard say?

30:54.286 --> 30:56.588
- It doesn't matter
what Richard says.

30:56.622 --> 30:59.225
I'm the one.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.360
You saw it, right?

31:01.393 --> 31:04.096
How I bled.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.001
- I don't think
I'm the man to do this.

31:09.035 --> 31:12.338
- Yes, you are.
- No.

31:12.371 --> 31:16.075
- You went behind
your wife's back for years

31:16.108 --> 31:17.352
so you could see
your daughter...

31:17.376 --> 31:18.610
- Mm-hmm.

31:18.644 --> 31:22.014
- Because you knew
that it was right.

31:22.048 --> 31:26.518
- It is time to pick sides.
- I don't want to pick sides.

31:26.552 --> 31:28.354
You're asking me
to betray my daughter.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.190
- No, I'm asking you
to pick you, okay?

31:31.223 --> 31:33.926
- What you believe in.
- No.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.364
I can't do it, Eddie.

31:38.397 --> 31:39.999
- Hank!

31:40.032 --> 31:42.634
What kind of man are you?

31:46.138 --> 31:53.079
* *

32:09.561 --> 32:11.530
- Hey.
- Hey. Um...

32:11.563 --> 32:13.265
what are you doing here?

32:13.299 --> 32:16.235
- Well, we've been dealing
with so much lately,

32:16.268 --> 32:20.973
I just wanted to come by
and... and check that you're okay.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.046
- Um, why don't you stay
for dinner?

32:27.079 --> 32:30.016
What is this about?

32:30.049 --> 32:33.019
- Uh, honey, uh, one more.

32:33.052 --> 32:34.353
- Hey.
- Hey.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.722
- Good to see everyone.
- Yeah.

32:36.755 --> 32:39.525
- Especially good to see you.

32:39.558 --> 32:41.027
How are you feeling?

32:41.060 --> 32:45.197
I know isolated meditation
can be hard.

32:45.231 --> 32:46.532
- I'm fine.

32:46.565 --> 32:48.734
- I think we're ready
to sit down.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.337
- Oh, no.
- Oh, please.

32:54.673 --> 32:58.277
- I ran into that Novice
after the security meeting.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.046
You really gave him a scare.

33:00.079 --> 33:01.747
- Uh, Carlos?
- How do you mean?

33:01.780 --> 33:05.217
- Well, Cal put the fear of God
into him.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.519
- Well, sometimes people
need to be reminded

33:07.553 --> 33:09.255
what's expected of them.

33:09.288 --> 33:10.522
- It seemed excessive.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.658
- Dad, why are you being
so combative?

33:12.691 --> 33:15.027
- You weren't there, Sarah.
- What'd the guy do?

33:15.061 --> 33:18.030
- Uh, he didn't do his job.
- That's all.

33:18.064 --> 33:21.667
- Oh, I apologize if I seemed
overly, uh, zealous.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.803
I-I had just been attacked.

33:24.836 --> 33:29.041
- This is not the place.
- Why did he attack you?

33:29.075 --> 33:30.476
- We don't know, honey.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.511
- Really? Or do you just not
want me to know?

33:32.544 --> 33:34.280
Cal?

33:34.313 --> 33:35.681
- What are you guys
talking about?

33:35.714 --> 33:38.050
- No, I have no problem
with you knowing.

33:38.084 --> 33:40.552
- Except this is not the time
or the place.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.255
- Knowing what?
- It's adult stuff, sweetie.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.790
- Because of the two of you?

33:44.823 --> 33:46.658
- You know, Hawk,
we'll talk about this later,

33:46.692 --> 33:48.094
when it's appropriate.

33:48.127 --> 33:49.661
- What's "appropriate"?

33:49.695 --> 33:51.230
- You can't treat me
like an adult

33:51.263 --> 33:52.774
merely when it serves
your own interests.

33:52.798 --> 33:55.501
- No, Sarah.

34:01.407 --> 34:04.643
- Sarah, what's happening here?

34:09.681 --> 34:11.382
- Hawk, wait.

34:11.417 --> 34:12.818
Hawk.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.858
- A lot's been going on.
- Yeah, seems like it.

34:19.891 --> 34:23.228
- Yeah, look, um...

34:23.262 --> 34:27.866
your mother and I
have grown close.

34:27.899 --> 34:30.668
Now, we weren't trying to keep
it a secret from you.

34:30.702 --> 34:32.670
- No?
- Just 'cause we're older,

34:32.704 --> 34:35.474
you know, doesn't mean
we have stuff figured out.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.109
- Apparently.

34:37.143 --> 34:39.844
- And... and it's...
- It's gonna be hard.

34:39.878 --> 34:43.549
As complicated as your
relationship is with your dad,

34:43.581 --> 34:46.885
it's still hard
to accept a new man

34:46.918 --> 34:48.853
in your life.

34:52.591 --> 34:55.694
Look, um...

34:55.726 --> 35:00.166
I know you missed restitution
to be with Ashley,

35:00.199 --> 35:02.234
and I'm sure she told you
that I offered her family

35:02.268 --> 35:04.536
a place to live last year
when they were homeless.

35:08.440 --> 35:11.677
- I didn't want to believe her.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.412
Why'd you do it?

35:15.247 --> 35:16.815
- For you.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.684
I did it for you, Hawk.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.387
If I hadn't,
would you have chosen to stay

35:21.420 --> 35:23.389
and... and walk in The Light

35:23.422 --> 35:25.691
and help this commu...
Help lead this community?

35:25.724 --> 35:28.727
- So you thought you'd make
that decision for me?

35:28.760 --> 35:30.829
- Man-to-man?

35:30.862 --> 35:32.564
- Yes. Please.

35:32.598 --> 35:35.901
- She chose a house over you.

35:35.934 --> 35:40.406
The girl chose a house...

35:40.439 --> 35:44.176
over your love.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.881
*

35:49.915 --> 35:53.852
Testing people... it's the only
way to know who they truly are.

35:53.885 --> 35:55.554
And...

35:55.587 --> 35:58.857
you asked about me and your mom,

35:58.890 --> 36:01.360
and you deserve
a straight answer.

36:03.429 --> 36:05.397
I love your mom

36:05.431 --> 36:07.599
with every fiber of my being.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.402
I pray she feels the same.

36:13.439 --> 36:20.379
*

36:36.928 --> 36:39.197
- Hawk.

36:50.742 --> 36:52.578
Wow.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.347
You look so different.

36:55.381 --> 36:57.583
And you're, uh...

36:57.616 --> 36:59.585
you're driving.

36:59.618 --> 37:02.721
When did you get your license?

37:02.754 --> 37:04.723
- Dad...

37:04.756 --> 37:06.692
- Look...

37:08.294 --> 37:10.896
I just...

37:10.929 --> 37:12.631
Did you get my message?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.400
- Yeah.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.870
- So...

37:18.904 --> 37:21.407
did you?

37:21.440 --> 37:23.575
- What?

37:23.609 --> 37:26.578
- Do this to me?

37:26.612 --> 37:29.881
- Did I... What?

37:29.915 --> 37:34.720
- Did you tell someone
that I wanted to see you and...

37:34.753 --> 37:37.022
- That's impossible.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.425
- Think about it, Hawk.

37:39.458 --> 37:42.894
- Look, Dad, you got to stop.
- You got to get out of here.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.596
You got to get
your life together.

37:44.630 --> 37:45.897
I mean...

37:45.931 --> 37:47.766
Look at you.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.901
- Hawk, this is because of them.

37:49.935 --> 37:52.804
- I didn't do this.
- You... you did.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.606
You went in there
ranting and raving,

37:54.640 --> 37:56.007
and this is what happens.

37:56.041 --> 37:58.410
- Okay, that was for a reason.

37:58.444 --> 37:59.878
- Yeah.

37:59.911 --> 38:01.680
Cal and Mom.

38:05.617 --> 38:08.053
- Wait. You know?

38:08.086 --> 38:11.690
- He loves her, Dad.
- We have to accept that.

38:14.092 --> 38:16.895
- Right, but what about her?

38:16.928 --> 38:19.598
What about your mom?

38:19.631 --> 38:21.400
Does she love him, too?

38:24.470 --> 38:26.405
Tell me.

38:28.106 --> 38:31.076
- You have to let her go, Dad,
and you have to let me go.

38:31.109 --> 38:34.079
You can't stalk me.
Don't send Ashley to me.

38:34.112 --> 38:38.083
- I didn't send her
to you, okay?

38:38.116 --> 38:40.051
I bump into her,
and she asked...

38:40.085 --> 38:42.854
- She chose a house over me.

38:44.823 --> 38:48.427
Okay?

38:48.460 --> 38:53.064
Just like Mom
chose Cal over you.

38:56.101 --> 39:00.071
*

39:00.105 --> 39:02.608
We have to accept these things.

39:02.641 --> 39:09.581
*

39:48.019 --> 39:50.489
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Sorry.

39:50.522 --> 39:52.824
I've been trying...

39:54.693 --> 39:56.662
- Are you all right?

39:56.695 --> 39:58.830
- No, I'm not fucking all right.

39:58.864 --> 40:00.165
- What happened to you?

40:00.198 --> 40:03.134
- Just go, Sarah.
- Go before I...

40:03.168 --> 40:05.136
- No, I...

40:05.170 --> 40:07.172
I want to make things right.

40:07.205 --> 40:10.442
- Things will never be right
with us.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.812
- How did you find out
about me and Cal?

40:13.845 --> 40:15.547
- Is that why you're here?

40:15.581 --> 40:17.483
Trying to figure out
who betrayed you?

40:17.516 --> 40:18.650
- No, that's not...

40:18.684 --> 40:20.151
- Not to explain yourself,

40:20.185 --> 40:21.987
not to apologize, not to...

40:22.020 --> 40:25.123
- I don't owe you an apology.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.158
- Oh, that's right.

40:27.192 --> 40:31.963
We don't owe each other
anything anymore.

40:31.997 --> 40:34.032
- We moved on...

40:34.065 --> 40:36.668
both of us.

40:36.702 --> 40:39.004
- You promised me.

40:39.037 --> 40:43.141
You laid in my bed,
and you promised me!

40:43.174 --> 40:44.976
A lot has happened.

40:45.010 --> 40:46.678
- Oh, yeah, it seems so.

40:46.712 --> 40:49.481
You know, you could relinquish
your guilt for Cal,

40:49.515 --> 40:51.983
but why don't you tell me
the rest of the horrible things

40:52.017 --> 40:54.653
you've done this past year?

40:54.686 --> 40:58.657
I am done trying to protect you!

40:58.690 --> 41:00.659
Take responsibility, Sarah,

41:00.692 --> 41:02.661
for the horrible shit
you have done.

41:05.697 --> 41:12.638
*

41:30.021 --> 41:33.291
Oh, fuck.

41:38.063 --> 41:39.698
- It's Richard.

41:39.731 --> 41:42.167
Leave me a message,
and I will return your call.

41:42.200 --> 41:43.301
Thank you.

41:43.334 --> 41:45.637
- Richard, call me back.
- Uh...

41:47.205 --> 41:49.841
Look, I messed up.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.947
I told Sarah.

41:55.981 --> 41:59.150
She might come to you.

42:05.891 --> 42:12.831
*

42:25.176 --> 42:27.679
- Mary, get in the car.
- Mary.

42:27.713 --> 42:34.185
*

42:37.188 --> 42:39.024
- Sean, no.

42:42.628 --> 42:49.567
*

43:32.678 --> 43:34.212
- Drive.

43:50.929 --> 43:57.869
*

44:20.792 --> 44:22.861
What are you hiding, Richard?

44:30.435 --> 44:34.773
*

44:34.806 --> 44:36.241
- Oh, damn it.

44:36.274 --> 44:43.014
*

45:27.893 --> 45:34.866
*

45:34.900 --> 45:36.401
Aah!

45:36.434 --> 45:39.004
Eddie, stop!
It's me!

45:39.037 --> 45:42.040
- Sam, what are you doing here?

45:42.073 --> 45:45.076
You went back?

45:45.110 --> 45:48.079
- I moved on to the compound.

45:48.113 --> 45:49.915
- Ah, Jesus.

45:49.948 --> 45:51.817
What, did Cal send you here?

45:51.850 --> 45:54.252
You know what? Tell that asshole
I'm not backing down!

45:54.285 --> 45:56.855
- Listen, you tell him yourself.

45:56.888 --> 46:01.026
I am done talking out
of two sides of my mouth, okay?

46:01.059 --> 46:03.261
- Why'd you go back?

46:07.833 --> 46:10.101
Did your baby not make it?

46:12.971 --> 46:14.239
O...

46:16.474 --> 46:18.076
She did.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.246
She healed overnight.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.248
She didn't even need
the operation,

46:23.281 --> 46:25.851
just like you prayed
to The Light for.

46:27.285 --> 46:30.421
- Man, I didn't want
to believe it.

46:30.455 --> 46:34.926
Shit, I still don't want
to believe it.

46:37.628 --> 46:39.564
Why are you here?

46:41.299 --> 46:45.236
- I'm just not clear
on anything anymore.

46:46.972 --> 46:51.609
But still, besides my wife
and my kids...

46:51.642 --> 46:55.113
you praying for my baby
the way that you did

46:55.146 --> 46:56.547
was the only moment of goodness

46:56.581 --> 46:59.617
that I've had
in a hell of a long time.

47:01.452 --> 47:05.423
- Everything else
has been a charade.

47:05.456 --> 47:09.861
But I want to feel more moments
like that again.

47:09.895 --> 47:11.429
Eddie...

47:14.465 --> 47:21.272
*

47:21.306 --> 47:23.441
My name isn't Sam.

47:23.474 --> 47:30.415
*

48:01.479 --> 48:08.419
*

49:14.485 --> 49:16.754
What are you doing to me?

49:16.787 --> 49:20.091
- Painting flowers
on your walls of doom.

49:26.664 --> 49:28.599
Your necklace...

49:28.633 --> 49:31.402
where is it?

49:31.436 --> 49:33.738
- Oh, I gave it
to the worthy one.

49:41.179 --> 49:42.613
- I earned the necklace!

49:44.582 --> 49:46.051
I earned it!

50:08.173 --> 50:11.642
- * Hush, little baby,
don't say a word *

50:11.676 --> 50:14.745
* Papa's gonna buy you
a mockingbird *

50:14.779 --> 50:18.783
* And if that mockingbird
won't sing *

50:18.816 --> 50:22.320
* Papa's gonna buy you
a diamond ring *

50:22.353 --> 50:28.459
* If that diamond ring
turns brass *

50:28.493 --> 50:34.299
* Papa's gonna buy you
a looking glass *

50:34.332 --> 50:37.635
* If that looking glass

50:37.668 --> 50:40.138
* Gets broke

50:40.171 --> 50:45.643
* Papa's gonna buy you
a billy goat *

50:45.676 --> 50:51.482
* If that billy goat
won't pull *

50:51.516 --> 50:57.488
* Papa's gonna buy you
a cart and bull *

50:57.522 --> 51:04.495
* If that cart and bull
fall down *

51:04.529 --> 51:07.498
* Well, you'll still be

51:07.532 --> 51:14.472
* The sweetest little baby
in town *

51:15.305 --> 51:21.322
