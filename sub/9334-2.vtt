17:48.700 --> 17:49.635
We'll split the 20 grand

17:49.701 --> 17:50.836
and go our separate ways.

17:50.903 --> 17:51.937
- What do you say we get back

17:52.004 --> 17:54.606
into our regular routine, sport?

17:54.673 --> 17:56.508
You know,
where we roll our eyes

17:56.575 --> 17:59.378
while you make
irresponsible wishes?

17:59.445 --> 18:00.546
- Awesome idea!

18:00.612 --> 18:02.648
I wish I were a sumo wrestler.

18:02.714 --> 18:04.049
[gong rings]

18:05.884 --> 18:07.352
- I'm wearing a diaper!

18:07.419 --> 18:10.088
It's so practical.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.924
both: Ahh!

18:11.990 --> 18:14.726
- Cosmo, Wanda,
why'd you turn back into fish?

18:14.793 --> 18:16.261
I need your magic.

18:16.328 --> 18:17.463
[shutters clicking]

18:17.529 --> 18:19.832
Ahh!

18:19.898 --> 18:21.733
- "Mayor's kid goes cuckoo,

18:21.800 --> 18:24.303
dresses in diapers,
and yells at fish."

18:24.369 --> 18:25.537
That's the first and last time

18:25.604 --> 18:27.339
I'll ever say that sentence.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.874
- Everyone thinks I'm crazy,

18:28.941 --> 18:31.376
and, worse yet,
people saw my butt.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.979
[horns honking]

18:36.482 --> 18:38.617
- Ah!

18:38.684 --> 18:39.952
{\an1}- Timmy,

18:40.018 --> 18:42.287
{\an1}your dad's green light law
is wreaking havoc.

18:42.354 --> 18:43.522
- Not my problem.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.891
{\an3}My problem is that people
saw my butt.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.327
{\an1}- Well, someone's got
to do something.

18:48.393 --> 18:49.628
Cosmo, Wanda,

18:49.695 --> 18:51.230
I wish I could help
the copper hoppers

18:51.296 --> 18:54.466
direct traffic.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.102
Pedestrians have
the right of way!

19:00.172 --> 19:01.507
- Ahh!

19:01.573 --> 19:02.541
- I need to get somewhere

19:02.608 --> 19:04.510
the paparazzi can't find us.

19:04.576 --> 19:08.046
Poof me to the middle
of nowhere.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.816
{\an1}- Here we are, Timmy,
in nowhere.

19:10.883 --> 19:14.686
Population: one.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.021
Make that none.

19:16.088 --> 19:18.090
{\an3}- I'd make your wish quick,
sport.

19:18.156 --> 19:20.959
People don't survive long
in this kind of heat.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.128
- Oh, now that you mention it,
I am kind of hot.

19:23.195 --> 19:25.264
Can you guys
poof me up some water?

19:25.330 --> 19:27.266
{\an1}- You got it, Timmy.
Ta-da!

19:27.332 --> 19:30.068
{\an3}- Cosmo, I am not drinking
out of a toilet.

19:30.135 --> 19:32.538
{\an1}- Why not?
Dogs do it all the time.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.339
- Do I look like a dog to you?

19:34.406 --> 19:35.841
[shutters clicking]

19:35.908 --> 19:38.544
- "Mayor's kid a total nut job--

19:38.610 --> 19:40.746

in underpants."

19:40.812 --> 19:43.015
{\an1}- Boy, Timmy,
you have really lost it.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.783
You might need the puppet.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.084
- I just need to clear my head

19:46.151 --> 19:48.654
and get away
from this whole nightmare.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.223

- Yay, Timmy!

20:00.332 --> 20:01.533
You're famous.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.702
- Oh, people saw my butt again.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.904
When will the madness end?

20:05.971 --> 20:07.139
{\an3}- Well, you know,
sport,

20:07.205 --> 20:09.741
{\an3}you can always un-wish
your mayor wish.

20:09.808 --> 20:11.677
- I can't do that to my dad.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.745
Being mayor makes him so happy.

20:13.812 --> 20:15.347
-<i> They caught Dinkleberg!</i>

20:15.414 --> 20:17.149
Oh, I'm so happy!

Ah!

both: Ahh!

20:31.196 --> 20:32.631
[toilet flushes]

20:32.698 --> 20:34.499
- I can't believe
I'm saying this,

20:34.566 --> 20:36.001
but as long as my dad's mayor,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.170
it's not safe for you guys
to be around me.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.372
{\an3}- What are you saying,
sport?

20:40.439 --> 20:41.773
- I have no choice.

20:41.840 --> 20:43.542
Cosmo, Wanda,

20:43.609 --> 20:45.243
I have to give you up.

20:45.310 --> 20:46.712
You guys'll be okay.

20:46.778 --> 20:48.413
You can live with Chloe.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.849
{\an1}- Well,
her room is cleaner.

20:50.916 --> 20:52.684
- Oh, sport--

20:52.751 --> 20:54.386
{\an1}- Let's be strong,
guys.

20:54.453 --> 20:55.654
No one cry.

20:55.721 --> 20:58.857
[all wailing]

21:00.525 --> 21:01.460
- Hey!

21:01.526 --> 21:02.461
- Ah!

21:02.527 --> 21:03.462
clang!

21:05.764 --> 21:07.833
Oh, sorry, Dad, I lost it.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.568
- It's okay, Timmy.

21:09.635 --> 21:11.470
{\an1}I watched
"The Mayor's Kid's a Kook,"

21:11.536 --> 21:13.338
{\an1}and I heard your tearful
good-bye to your fish

21:13.405 --> 21:14.973
and then you pretending
to be your fish

21:15.040 --> 21:16.775
and answering yourself.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.110
Cuckoo, cuckoo.

21:18.176 --> 21:20.312
Anyway, Son,
I love being mayor,

21:20.379 --> 21:22.347
but I can't stand
seeing you this sad,

21:22.414 --> 21:23.815
so I'm gonna resign.

21:23.882 --> 21:26.518
Also, I'm sick of seeing
pictures of your butt.

21:31.923 --> 21:32.958
- [laughs]

21:33.025 --> 21:34.559
This is awesome.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.028
Now that my dad's not mayor,

21:36.094 --> 21:38.730
I wish the paparazzi were gone.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.599

21:53.278 --> 21:55.747
<i>Everything is back to normal,</i>

21:55.814 --> 21:57.449
and by normal,
I mean we have a mayor

21:57.516 --> 22:00.552
who lives with a goat that's
an international rap star.

- I'm still glad we wished
for your dad to be mayor.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.396
- People saw my butt!

22:11.463 --> 22:13.665
-<i> Oh, Timmy,</i>

22:13.732 --> 22:15.867
I found a new way
to get respect--

22:15.934 --> 22:17.169
being a good dad--

22:17.235 --> 22:18.804
also by being a test subject

22:18.870 --> 22:20.172
for a new hair growth formula.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.474
It's called Crazy Hair.
