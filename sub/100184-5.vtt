10:58.283 --> 10:59.951
She says she wants
to be with me,

11:00.034 --> 11:01.786
but she doesn't need me
to raise her kid.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.497
‐What does that even mean?
‐I have no idea.

11:04.581 --> 11:07.250
I think that's
what I do.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.668
‐[woman] <i>Hello?</i>
‐Hi. Hi.

11:08.751 --> 11:10.211
This is Alice Pieszecki.
I'm calling

11:10.295 --> 11:12.046
to remind you to vote
for Bette Porter on March 15.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.465
‐So what're you gonna do?
‐I really don't know.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.717
[Alice] No.
You didn't win anything, ma'am.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.385
‐Nope, not a joke. [chuckles]
<i>‐You're wasting my time.</i>

11:17.468 --> 11:19.179
[Bette] Wouldn't it be nice
if we didn't have to weigh

11:19.262 --> 11:21.389
the consequences
of every decision we make?

11:21.472 --> 11:23.516
I'm gonna have to ask you
to stop yelling at me, ma'am.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.809
[woman] <i>What?</i>
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

11:24.893 --> 11:25.894
My God,
that would be nice.

11:25.977 --> 11:29.939
I just... I want to know
when it got so hard.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.232
[woman] <i>Sorry.</i>
<i>I got someone on the line.</i>

11:31.316 --> 11:33.568
Everybody thinks I'm gonna
give them something for free.

11:33.651 --> 11:34.694
All the time.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.486
You'll make the right choice.

11:35.570 --> 11:38.156
‐I hope so.
‐[dialing]

11:38.239 --> 11:40.283
You will.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.620
Because there
is no right choice,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.413
only choices.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.291
I feel like that was
directed at me somehow.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.251
‐[woman 2] <i>Hello?</i>
‐Uh, hi, there.

11:50.335 --> 11:51.961
[Southern accent]
Ma'am, this is Shane McCutcheon.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.129
I'm calling to ask you to vote

11:53.213 --> 11:53.755
for Bette Porter
on March...

11:53.838 --> 11:56.299
‐[Bette] 15th.
‐15th.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.425
[woman 2]
<i>Oh, of course. She's amazing.</i>

11:57.508 --> 11:59.093
[Shane]
Oh, well, thank you kindly.

11:59.177 --> 12:01.262
You have a nice one, too.
Bye‐bye.

12:01.346 --> 12:04.849
People respond better
to Southern accents. I don't...

12:04.933 --> 12:05.975
Give it a shot.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.144
‐Don't look at me.
‐Fill out your sheet.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.022
‐Hi.
‐Hey.

12:11.105 --> 12:11.898
You look dewy.

12:11.981 --> 12:15.276
Ugh, I'm disgusting,
but thank you.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.444
Ooh, what you got for me?

12:16.527 --> 12:18.279
I'm pretty sure
my dad got these,

12:18.363 --> 12:19.280
but I definitely should've lied
and said they were from me.

12:19.364 --> 12:22.158
Oh, okay, let's see.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.409
‐Ooh, there's chocolate.
‐Ooh, yeah, give me.

12:23.493 --> 12:24.744
No. Don't do it.
No, it's for me.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.498
‐Oh, my God.
‐What is it?

12:28.581 --> 12:29.707
It's a prenup.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.584
‐Oh.
‐Shut the fuck up.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.336
Let me see.

12:33.419 --> 12:37.382
[laughs] What a dick.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.800
It's not funny.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.260
If you're not laughing,
you're crying.

12:40.343 --> 12:42.095
What the fuck is wrong with him?

12:42.178 --> 12:43.304
I‐I don't know,

12:43.388 --> 12:44.973
but I can't
eat these now.

12:45.056 --> 12:48.226
He's always gonna
be like this, isn't he?

12:51.896 --> 12:53.856
[sighs]
Yeah.

12:56.067 --> 12:56.776
I am so sorry.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
I am so sorry
that he's like this.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.530
‐You don't deserve any of this.
‐Mm, hey, it's okay.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.865
‐Babe.
‐No, it's not, though.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.575
‐Really, it's not.
‐I'll just sign it.

13:04.659 --> 13:06.327
What? No. I'm not
letting you sign that.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.495
Hey.

13:07.578 --> 13:10.957
Listen to me.

13:11.040 --> 13:15.962
All I want to do is marry you.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.964
And have, like, mm,

13:18.047 --> 13:19.799
‐nine kids with you.
‐[laughs] Oh.

13:19.882 --> 13:20.633
‐Nine? Wow.
‐Yeah.

13:20.717 --> 13:23.177
And if signing
this stupid thing

13:23.261 --> 13:25.847
is gonna make your dad happy,
I'll sign it.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.932
If that means
I get to have you.

13:28.016 --> 13:30.727
‐You sure?
‐Yeah.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.271
I know you'll take care of me
if you fuck all this up.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.148
‐I'm not gonna fuck it up.
‐[José] I said the curator

13:35.231 --> 13:37.108
<i>might</i> let me
into his show.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.527
They're gonna say yes, José.
[chuckles]

13:39.610 --> 13:42.113
Night Gallery
would be pretty dope.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.949
Listen, all right?
It <i>will</i> be dope.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.951
It will.

13:47.827 --> 13:51.289
You're so cute. I love you.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.586
Okay, uh, I'll see you later.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.962
Yeah.

13:58.046 --> 13:59.881
‐Okay. Okay.
‐Yep. I'll see you.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.508
‐Yep.
‐Ooh! I heard that!

14:02.592 --> 14:04.302
No, no. Don't start.
That was an error.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.304
‐Was it?
‐No, it was. It was. It‐‐

14:06.387 --> 14:07.847
‐Wasn't it?
‐[Sophie] An error? Uh...

14:07.930 --> 14:09.891
‐It didn't sound like it.
‐[Dani] I'm pretty sure I just

14:09.974 --> 14:11.601
‐heard him say
that he loves you!
‐No, you're the worst!

14:11.684 --> 14:12.727
Ah, that's so cute.
You run up them stairs.

14:12.810 --> 14:16.522
‐[Maribel] Uh, guys?
‐What?

14:16.606 --> 14:18.566
Mm, there's a really
weird clause here.

14:18.649 --> 14:20.234
W‐What is it?

14:20.318 --> 14:21.903
I'm an immigration
attorney,

14:21.986 --> 14:23.112
‐so I really could be wrong‐‐
‐Just tell us what it says.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.783
Okay, well, Sophie, if you
give birth to any children,

14:26.866 --> 14:31.412
they can't claim
Dani's family's money.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.955
‐[laughs softly]
‐What?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.333
But if Dani has
the children,

14:35.416 --> 14:38.544
then they'll be part
of her family's trust.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.589
Wow.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.466
Damn. Okay.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.427
Wow, so my kids aren't
part of his family now.

14:46.511 --> 14:48.638
‐We are not signing that.
‐You know what, babe? I‐‐

14:48.721 --> 14:51.349
No. We are not starting off
our marriage like that.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.768
I'll handle it.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.526
[Finley] You were right.
This is really helping.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.361
‐Thank you.
‐[Tess] Good. I'm glad.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.239
[Finley groans]

15:06.322 --> 15:08.116
Maybe I should get, like,
a mimosa or something.

15:08.199 --> 15:10.201
Little hair of the dog,
you know?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.787
Oh. God, you had fun
last night, huh?

15:12.870 --> 15:16.415
Eh, I don't really remember
anything, but sure.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.959
Mm‐hmm.

15:18.042 --> 15:21.087
I actually have
this terrible feeling

15:21.170 --> 15:24.507
that I have to apologize to the
girl that I'm sort of dating,

15:24.590 --> 15:25.967
but everything's
a little foggy,

15:26.050 --> 15:29.554
‐so I don't really know.
‐Mm‐hmm. I've been there.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.347
‐Really?
‐Oh, my God, yes.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.142
Please, I don't remember
most of my 20s. Mm.

15:34.225 --> 15:36.853
Which is why I'm sober now.

15:36.936 --> 15:39.605
‐Oh, shit.
‐Yep. Two years.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.440
‐Cool.
‐Yeah, no, I wanted

15:41.524 --> 15:43.067
to start remembering stuff.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.987
I wanted to feel again.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.989
‐Mm‐hmm.

‐Oh, shit.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.509
Sorry.

16:08.593 --> 16:10.386
Thanks.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.226

to feel all that.

‐Okay, she's super hot.

makes me want to puke.

Yeah, I think we all had
plenty to drink last night.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.728
Yeah, so, about last night.

17:00.811 --> 17:04.023
Do you guys want
to talk about it, or...

17:04.106 --> 17:07.401
No? I mean,
it's fine either way.

17:07.485 --> 17:10.988
‐I'm just curious.
‐We had a threesome.

17:12.949 --> 17:15.993

just leave it at that.

‐Or...
‐Alice.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.382

No, they don't.

17:29.465 --> 17:32.385
Sometimes they add... Nick.

17:32.468 --> 17:33.511
That's very different.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.597
Okay, I don't know who
these people are, but I love

are doing this.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.976
Oh, for sure.

17:40.059 --> 17:41.936
Yeah.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.397
'Cause I thought
last night was great.

‐Yes.

lose me, Gigi.

Big difference.

How else do you want me
to show you how sorry I am?

18:24.895 --> 18:25.605
This was a mistake.

18:25.688 --> 18:29.108
‐Mistake.
‐O‐Okay.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.901
‐That's fine.
‐[Nat] Yeah.

18:30.985 --> 18:31.819
We can just pretend
like it never happened.

18:31.902 --> 18:34.655
‐Totally.
‐I can do that.

18:34.739 --> 18:38.034
You know, why are you
so willing to get in on this?

18:38.117 --> 18:39.660
Because I would do anything

‐to have you‐‐
‐This is so messy.

18:42.413 --> 18:43.956

You really hurt me.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.502

And I loved you so much.

‐And I never thought

18:52.673 --> 18:53.883
that I was gonna get over you.

I found someone really great‐‐

18:56.594 --> 18:59.472
and somehow,

18:59.555 --> 19:00.514
you're still here.

19:00.598 --> 19:05.311
So how is it that you get
to fuck everything up

always?
