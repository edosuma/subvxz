WEBVTT

00:08.039 --> 00:10.080
Anybody who knows
my partner Kyle

00:10.119 --> 00:13.000
knows that he was on a soap
opera for like three years.

00:13.039 --> 00:14.720
As it turns out, Kyle
was dead for three years,

00:14.759 --> 00:16.359
but came back to life.

00:16.399 --> 00:17.839
It’s actually something
that also happens

00:17.879 --> 00:19.239
on this competition.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.000
You have three lives,
but only one matters.

00:22.039 --> 00:24.239
The one that takes you
across the finish line.

00:24.280 --> 00:25.800
Mm-hmm.

00:25.839 --> 00:28.239
Tonight on "Frogger"...

00:28.280 --> 00:29.519
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

00:29.559 --> 00:32.439
With three life-threatening
levels to conquer...

00:32.479 --> 00:33.439
Oh!

00:33.479 --> 00:35.880
- Who will jump...
- Oh my gosh.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.759
He’s superman!

00:36.799 --> 00:38.920
- Punch...
- Ah!

00:38.960 --> 00:41.679
Or even lunch their way
to Frogger glory?

00:41.719 --> 00:43.119
[laughing]

00:43.159 --> 00:47.439
For the victors,
Boss Toad’s Bonus Round beckons.

00:47.479 --> 00:51.280
Up for grabs, the $10,000
Golden Fanny Pack.

00:51.320 --> 00:52.119
Woo!

00:52.159 --> 00:54.119
- Hold on tight...
- No!

00:54.159 --> 00:55.840
I just felt my
butt cheeks clench.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.280
It’s going to be
a Froggin’ wild ride.

00:58.320 --> 00:59.600
This is it, this is it,
this is it, this is it.

00:59.640 --> 01:01.520
- Yeah!
- Woo-hoo-hoo

01:01.560 --> 01:02.600
We got it, we got it.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.040
Yeah, baby.

01:04.079 --> 01:06.120
- I’m Damon Wayans Jr.
- I’m Kyle Brandt.

01:06.159 --> 01:08.760
And this is "Frogger."

01:13.280 --> 01:15.799
Join us inside the world’s
biggest arcade machine

01:15.840 --> 01:19.879
as another six mighty Froggers
put everything on the line.

01:19.920 --> 01:21.319
It’s a real-life
video game,

01:21.359 --> 01:22.719
and there’s real money
at stake with

01:22.760 --> 01:23.760
tonight’s top frog
taking home

01:23.799 --> 01:26.239
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.319
Who wants to get the popcorn?

01:27.359 --> 01:28.640
I love me some popcorn.

01:28.680 --> 01:30.280
You’re one of those fiends
at the movie theater

01:30.319 --> 01:32.879
who puts like the crazy
seasoning on the popcorn.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.439
I bring my own seasoning
from home.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.079
You mean you smuggle
your own seasoning?

01:36.120 --> 01:37.599
- Yes.
- You do?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.319
I put it in my purse.

01:39.359 --> 01:41.480
Everybody start
the countdown

01:41.519 --> 01:44.719
because it’s time for
Frogs in Space.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.200
Bouncing to the craters,
Froggers will climb

01:47.239 --> 01:49.680
the satellite to
start the launch sequence.

01:49.719 --> 01:51.840
They’ll have to leap from
the second satellite

01:51.879 --> 01:53.959
to the spinning space amphibian

01:54.000 --> 01:57.319
dodge the space jets and inch
around the galaxy hopper

01:57.359 --> 02:01.359
before facing the space worms
on their way to the landing pad.

02:05.079 --> 02:05.840
Ah!

02:05.879 --> 02:07.560
- Here we go.
- Woo!

02:07.599 --> 02:10.479
Look at the size of that man.
An absolute unit.

02:10.520 --> 02:11.919
- I take the steps.
- Come on, princess.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.479
At my age, you got
to take the steps.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.479
This guy’s doomed.

02:14.520 --> 02:15.800
Woo-hoo.

02:15.840 --> 02:21.080
It’s Rock Dad Joe
versus Biologist James.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.719
My name is Joe Castagna.

02:22.759 --> 02:24.360
I’m 40 years old, I’m a dad

02:24.400 --> 02:26.919
and I’m a high school
English teacher.

02:26.960 --> 02:29.120
The ’80s wouldn’t
let go of me.

02:29.159 --> 02:33.280
I incorporate Bruce Springsteen
into every poetry unit I teach.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.599
I’m keeping Dad Rock alive.

02:35.639 --> 02:38.439
one Springsteen song
at a time.

02:38.479 --> 02:40.520
Dad Rock, everybody!

02:40.560 --> 02:42.680
I’m James Leon, I’m 22 years old

02:42.719 --> 02:44.280
and I’m a biology major,

02:44.319 --> 02:47.800
and I have won not one, but
two bodybuilding competitions.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.280
I do have the muscle,
but these biceps

02:50.319 --> 02:51.800
aren’t my biggest muscle.

02:51.840 --> 02:52.919
It’s actually my brain.

02:52.960 --> 02:54.879
Very smart.

02:55.879 --> 02:57.639
Come on, Joe, easy money.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.919
Ready, Frogger 1?
Here we go!

02:59.960 --> 03:01.680
All right, 40 year old
Joe Castagna

03:01.719 --> 03:03.400
from Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

03:03.439 --> 03:05.319
He is all dad.

03:05.360 --> 03:06.520
Woo, and he is off.

03:06.560 --> 03:07.439
That was impressive.

03:07.479 --> 03:08.199
- Great job.
- Woo!

03:08.240 --> 03:09.360
Best we’ve ever seen.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.120
Right across the
crustacean craters.

03:11.159 --> 03:13.800
And he is already on to
the second space rocket booster.

03:13.840 --> 03:16.199
Wayans, this dad came to play.

03:16.240 --> 03:17.560
This guy’s not stopping.

03:17.599 --> 03:18.719
Get up there, boy!

03:18.759 --> 03:20.400
Joe is fast, aggressive.

03:20.439 --> 03:22.719
Those orange wristbands,
they look kinda cool.

03:22.759 --> 03:24.800
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

03:26.560 --> 03:28.599
Hey!

03:28.639 --> 03:29.960
We love these guys because

03:30.000 --> 03:31.360
they’re classically
trained in Frogger.

03:31.400 --> 03:32.520
He’s 40, he actually
grew up in arcades.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.120
<i>T-minus five.</i>

03:34.159 --> 03:36.159
He’s going fast, but he’s
also really calculated.

03:36.199 --> 03:38.759
I agree, this is not
a reckless speed right here.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.039
- No.
- Doing 90 in the left lane

03:41.080 --> 03:45.080
in his minivan, on to
the F7 Satellite O.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.680
The cannon take it, though,
and he’s off.

03:46.719 --> 03:48.800
- A little slip!
- Wow!

03:48.840 --> 03:50.319
- Oh, Joe!
- Woo!

03:50.360 --> 03:52.879
Unbelievable.

03:52.919 --> 03:55.800
Crack a cold one and start
the barbecue for the dad

03:55.840 --> 03:57.680
- from Pennsylvania.
- Wow.

03:57.719 --> 03:59.199
Now going to try to
make that jump

03:59.240 --> 04:03.919
to the spinning space amphibian
and here come the cannons.

04:03.960 --> 04:06.319
Don’t get nervous now.
You better do it.

04:06.360 --> 04:08.639
A quick jump onto
the spinning space amphibian

04:08.680 --> 04:10.039
- Oh!
- Oh!

04:10.080 --> 04:12.240
- Is he down?
- He’s done!

04:12.280 --> 04:13.120
Is he out?

04:14.439 --> 04:15.800
And he’s alive!

04:15.840 --> 04:18.000
- Wait!
- He’s still holding on.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.959
But he’s alive, he held on
with that dad strength.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.720
I cannot believe that.

04:22.759 --> 04:23.959
What a save.

04:24.000 --> 04:25.319
- This is amazing.
- Oh!

04:25.360 --> 04:27.480
He fell, I thought he
was done right there.

04:27.519 --> 04:30.079
Nope, not on my watch.

04:32.439 --> 04:33.759
Unbelievable.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.040
<i>T-minus four.</i>

04:35.079 --> 04:37.360
<i>Space station now activated.</i>

04:37.399 --> 04:40.720
All right, that’s Croaknik
with the giant golden doors.

04:40.759 --> 04:42.920
I’m getting excited.

04:42.959 --> 04:44.199
- Woo!
- Nice.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.959
All right, Joe one of the
only Froggers

04:46.000 --> 04:48.800
who was around when
the Doors were still a band.

04:48.839 --> 04:50.920
He’s got three more
to get past

04:50.959 --> 04:52.920
and then yet another
space amphibian.

04:52.959 --> 04:55.800
And he is now passing
through them.

04:55.839 --> 04:58.040
Break on through, Joe.

04:58.079 --> 05:00.160
This is awesome.
The final space amphibian,

05:00.199 --> 05:02.399
and then we get into
the space worms.

05:02.439 --> 05:03.240
He’s got to time it

05:03.279 --> 05:05.439
They go at two seconds per bow.

05:05.480 --> 05:08.319
It kills the concentration,
the balance.

05:08.360 --> 05:09.360
Oh boy.

05:09.399 --> 05:10.480
Gosh, he is tough.

05:10.519 --> 05:13.079
Now four jumps remaining.

05:13.120 --> 05:15.399
These are five feet,
and then a full eight foot

05:15.439 --> 05:16.439
to the red button.

05:16.480 --> 05:18.759
We have seen it drop
many Froggers

05:18.800 --> 05:19.759
to the bottom
of the pool.

05:19.800 --> 05:20.720
Ah!

05:20.759 --> 05:21.959
<i>T-minus three.</i>

05:22.000 --> 05:23.720
This is a David and
Goliath on paper.

05:23.759 --> 05:25.480
He is way older than James.

05:25.519 --> 05:26.800
He is much smaller.

05:26.839 --> 05:28.920
He is a school teacher
against a body builder.

05:28.959 --> 05:32.199
Joe is an absolute maniac
her, Wayans.

05:32.240 --> 05:33.120
<i>T-minus two.</i>

05:33.160 --> 05:34.720
I thought this
40-year-old dad

05:34.759 --> 05:36.360
was the underdog
in this race.

05:36.399 --> 05:37.879
This is madness.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.120
There it is, Joe.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.920
Two more jumps for
the big Springsteen fan.

05:41.959 --> 05:43.879
Can he finish this thing?

05:43.920 --> 05:44.720
Boom!

05:44.759 --> 05:46.279
<i>T-minus one.</i>

05:46.319 --> 05:51.240
Last jump remaining, it is
an eight foot gargantuan leap.

05:51.279 --> 05:53.560
That red button is
all that is left

05:53.600 --> 05:55.120
and Joe...

05:55.160 --> 05:58.279
- Across!
- Yeah!

05:58.319 --> 05:59.720
Launch the rocket.

05:59.759 --> 06:01.360
Hey, Joe, I can hear you baby!

06:01.399 --> 06:02.600
That’s what I’m talking about.

06:02.639 --> 06:04.920
Frogger! One life, baby!

06:04.959 --> 06:08.800
One run, one life.
One win.

06:08.839 --> 06:10.759
How do you do that?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.360
How do you beat that?

06:12.399 --> 06:13.800
Unbelievable.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.639
Look at this jump.

06:15.680 --> 06:16.879
Stick the booty up.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.319
- Mm-hmm.
- That’s what I like.

06:18.360 --> 06:20.720
You gotta stick up the hump
to get over the hump.

06:20.759 --> 06:21.639
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.160
Bottom line.

06:23.199 --> 06:25.959
That was one of the fastest
runs we have ever seen

06:26.000 --> 06:27.079
on this crossing.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.360
My turn, baby,
let’s go!

06:28.399 --> 06:30.519
We have the perfect
physical specimen here.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.519
This guy is a marble statue.
a Greek god,

06:33.560 --> 06:34.720
and he might get
knocked out

06:34.759 --> 06:36.399
by the guy with
the orange wristbands.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.040
[Damon chuckles]

06:37.079 --> 06:39.000
Ready, Frogger 2?

06:39.040 --> 06:39.800
I’m ready.

06:39.839 --> 06:41.279
Here we go.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.800
Yeah, James!

06:47.839 --> 06:50.160
22 year old James Leon,
the perfect specimen,

06:50.199 --> 06:52.000
is already off
to a running start,

06:52.040 --> 06:53.920
and he needs to have
the perfect run.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.480
One mistake,
he goes home.

06:55.519 --> 06:58.120
Nice little climb here, James.
Nice little climb.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.120
The most important muscle
right now

06:59.160 --> 07:00.839
what do we say, is the brain?

07:00.879 --> 07:02.680
Which is technically
not a muscle.

07:02.720 --> 07:04.600
That’s okay, don’t get
caught up in semantics.

07:04.639 --> 07:07.120
This is a thinking man.

07:07.160 --> 07:10.519
<i>Launch sequence activated.</i>

07:10.560 --> 07:12.839
The thing is people who
look like they should

07:12.879 --> 07:14.519
be really good at this?

07:14.560 --> 07:16.680
- Aren’t really good at this.
- Yeah.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.360
The jacked guy jinx.

07:18.399 --> 07:19.920
It’s almost like
if you could bench 250,

07:19.959 --> 07:20.600
you’re not good at Frogger.

07:20.639 --> 07:22.000
Yep.

07:22.040 --> 07:22.800
He’s going to try to
break that, though.

07:22.839 --> 07:24.920
<i>T-minus five.</i>

07:24.959 --> 07:27.240
Look at the tricep.
My goodness.

07:27.279 --> 07:28.160
I’m sorry, what?

07:28.199 --> 07:29.680
- Sorry.
- Kyle, you’re drooling.

07:29.720 --> 07:31.759
I’m a big fan of
James Leon.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.480
Look at him,
just so focused.

07:33.519 --> 07:34.879
You got this, James.
You got this, man.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.240
You got it.

07:36.279 --> 07:37.759
If James gets eliminated
at home, they’ll go,

07:37.800 --> 07:39.240
"who’d you lost to?"

07:39.279 --> 07:41.399
Oh, this Springsteen fan
who teaches English and is 40.

07:41.439 --> 07:43.120
- What? What?
- Who’s Springsteen?

07:43.160 --> 07:45.480
Yeah, it’s this old
guy from New Jersey. Love him.

07:46.879 --> 07:50.000
One false step
and this is over.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.600
- Yeah, James!
- Oh my gosh.

07:51.639 --> 07:55.040
- We’re on to satellite O.
- He got shot right in the face.

07:55.079 --> 07:56.560
You got it, you got it,
you got it.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.439
It ain’t over, Wayans.

07:58.480 --> 08:00.000
Great job, great job.

08:00.040 --> 08:01.120
Far from over.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.560
He’s a beautiful kid, come on.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.319
[laughing]

08:05.360 --> 08:07.399
He’s been in that squat
position a million times.

08:07.439 --> 08:09.040
Can he get it up?

08:09.079 --> 08:11.480
- And all right.
- Yes! Yes!

08:11.519 --> 08:14.319
- Shades of like an Aquaman.
- Oh, yeah.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.720
Standing on cliffs
flexing the deltoids.

08:16.759 --> 08:18.720
Looking beautiful.

08:18.759 --> 08:20.839
<i>T-minus four.</i>

08:20.879 --> 08:23.120
<i>Space station now activated.</i>

08:23.160 --> 08:25.120
All right, now that is
countdown platform four.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.519
He’s got to climb up on top
of Croaknik now.

08:27.560 --> 08:29.759
Remember, he needs
to complete this crossing

08:29.800 --> 08:31.279
just to make it a tie.

08:31.319 --> 08:33.320
This guy seems like
he’s in complete control.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.879
And I have a feeling we’re
going to a tie-breaker.

08:35.919 --> 08:39.039
Never underestimate
the golden doors.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.639
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

08:41.679 --> 08:42.799
- Is he down?
- He’s done!

08:42.840 --> 08:44.519
Oh!

08:44.559 --> 08:46.240
Wayans, it’s over.

08:46.279 --> 08:49.240
Oh shock and awe on
Frogs in Space.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.320
- James Leon is done.
- Wow.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.000
I honestly didn’t
see that coming.

08:54.039 --> 08:55.320
- No.
- Woo!

08:55.360 --> 08:57.399
Congratulations to Joe
who just finished

08:57.440 --> 09:00.600
the best run we have ever seen
on Frogs in Space,

09:00.639 --> 09:03.559
and knocks out James
to become tonight’s

09:03.600 --> 09:06.120
first Frogger into
the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

09:06.159 --> 09:07.519
That one was tough.

09:07.559 --> 09:09.519
James is a true onesie
but somebody had to go.

09:09.559 --> 09:10.440
Congrats, bro.

09:10.480 --> 09:12.000
So who’ll be joining Joe

09:12.039 --> 09:14.519
to battle it out for
the $10,000 Golden Fanny Pack?

09:14.559 --> 09:17.000
We’re about to find out and
good luck to whoever that is.

09:26.080 --> 09:27.200
[phone rings]

09:27.240 --> 09:29.759
[feminine voice]
Hello?

09:29.799 --> 09:31.919
Yes.

09:31.960 --> 09:32.879
That’s my Meryl Streep.

09:32.919 --> 09:33.919
Oh, no kidding.

09:33.960 --> 09:35.120
- [phone rings]
- Try it again.

09:35.159 --> 09:38.159
[feminine voice]
Hello?

09:38.200 --> 09:40.960
Yes, I’ll make your pizza.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.720
Can’t she work at
Pizza Rana?

09:42.759 --> 09:43.759
We need new help.

09:43.799 --> 09:46.240
The chef we have
is terrible.

09:47.720 --> 09:49.960
Welcome my friends
to Frog City,

09:50.000 --> 09:52.639
where the goal is to
get from uptown to downtown

09:52.679 --> 09:53.600
via Mud town.

09:56.039 --> 09:57.679
Drink in Frog City for
a minute, Wayans.

09:57.720 --> 09:59.399
- It’s sort of an almost...
- It’s a mess.

09:59.440 --> 10:04.200
Gotham-like, dark, dreary,
foreboding urban center.

10:04.240 --> 10:05.519
I like it.

10:05.559 --> 10:06.919
You like that kind of place?

10:06.960 --> 10:10.159
Yeah, I feel at home.
You know what I mean?

10:10.200 --> 10:12.039
After crossing
Hopper’s Highway,

10:12.080 --> 10:13.879
and engaging the
crosswalk signal,

10:13.919 --> 10:15.960
Froggers must leap to
to the Croaklyn Bridge,

10:16.000 --> 10:17.759
and pass the Thunder Truck

10:17.799 --> 10:19.200
to order a pizza.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.240
Running a gauntlet
of drifting cars,

10:21.279 --> 10:23.720
and ramming vans
to collect their pizza,

10:23.759 --> 10:26.759
it’s a final taxi hop
to the landing pad.

10:26.799 --> 10:29.120
Yes, it’s Frog City,

10:29.159 --> 10:31.679
a crossing with plenty
of speed bumps.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.919
The Croaklyn Bridge,
a 12-foot see saw with no grip

10:35.960 --> 10:37.759
and plenty of slip.

10:37.799 --> 10:39.720
Froggers must time
their jump

10:39.759 --> 10:41.039
or slide right off.

10:41.080 --> 10:43.879
And the Jean Claude Ram Vans.

10:43.919 --> 10:45.519
Each four-foot wide van
packs

10:45.559 --> 10:49.080
200 pounds of pushing power.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.919
And now, a rivalry
as old as time,

10:51.960 --> 10:56.240
the battle of the brothers,
Derrick versus Durrel.

10:56.279 --> 10:59.679
I’m Derrick, 37 years old.
and I’m a bartender.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.279
I’m Durrell, I’m 27 years old,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.159
and I’m a professional
basketball player.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.159
Most of my family
know me as Tater.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.960
I used to have a head
shaped like a potato.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.759
My whole life,
I’ve been called Nugget.

11:08.799 --> 11:11.279
My dad said that my head look
like a chicken nugget.

11:11.320 --> 11:15.399
And ever since then,
I’ve just been called Nugget.

11:15.440 --> 11:16.879
Hey, little bro,
what’s going on, bud?

11:16.919 --> 11:18.879
Yeah.

11:18.919 --> 11:20.720
Move, this is my interview!

11:20.759 --> 11:22.399
This is our interview.

11:22.440 --> 11:23.720
- No, this is my interview.
- This is our interview.

11:23.759 --> 11:25.159
No, this is my interview.

11:25.200 --> 11:26.519
I’ve been playing Frogger
my whole life.

11:26.559 --> 11:28.759
I’m the second oldest
in my family.

11:28.799 --> 11:30.919
We’re all competitive.

11:30.960 --> 11:32.720
Like we used to
compete every day.

11:32.759 --> 11:33.960
Not only am I the youngest,

11:34.000 --> 11:36.159
but I’m better at basketball.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.399
You’re better at basketball?
I taught you how to play.

11:38.440 --> 11:39.559
Don’t believe that.

11:39.600 --> 11:41.200
Don’t believe none of that!

11:41.240 --> 11:43.279
That’s where you learned....
you learned everything from me.

11:43.320 --> 11:45.320
That’s a lie!

11:45.360 --> 11:46.960
Clearly, you haven’t
learned yet.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.039
Yeah, all right.

11:48.080 --> 11:49.799
- Little bro.
- I hate you.

11:51.960 --> 11:54.799
Cane and Abel,
Thor and Loki,

11:54.840 --> 11:56.759
Mufasa and Scar.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.440
Good luck.

11:58.480 --> 11:59.399
Nugget versus Tater.

11:59.440 --> 12:00.679
I mean, not too much
good luck.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.120
Let’s see what they got.

12:02.159 --> 12:03.879
Are you two ballers looking
forward to settling

12:03.919 --> 12:06.320
your sibling rivalry
once and for all?

12:06.360 --> 12:07.360
I am, yeah.

12:07.399 --> 12:08.559
Ready, Frogger 1?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.360
I’m ready, Damon.

12:10.399 --> 12:12.039
Here we go.

12:12.080 --> 12:14.279
Here comes Derrick, AKA Tater.

12:18.600 --> 12:19.960
- Oh!
- Uh-oh!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.159
Slippity slipping.
Michael Pippen.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.440
Yo!

12:23.480 --> 12:25.279
- Brother’s laughing at him.
- Of course he is.

12:25.320 --> 12:26.360
- I’m good though.
- Yeah, you’re good?

12:26.399 --> 12:28.039
- I’m good.
- Hey, yo.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.159
He’s going to have to
get to that crosswalk button

12:30.200 --> 12:31.720
and then we’ve got business
to attend to

12:31.759 --> 12:33.519
and already the chatter
is starting

12:33.559 --> 12:35.039
between the brothers.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.879
There you go, playa pimping.

12:36.919 --> 12:37.879
You know anything
about brothers?

12:37.919 --> 12:40.879
No.

12:40.919 --> 12:42.360
Would you ever do this?

12:42.399 --> 12:45.159
Against my family? I would smoke
anybody in my family.

12:45.200 --> 12:46.600
Call somebody out right now,
they’re watching.

12:46.639 --> 12:47.960
- Who would you smoke?
- Craig!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
He’s probably like
my biggest competition.

12:50.039 --> 12:51.279
- Craig Wayans?
- Craig Wayans. Yeah.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.320
Now if he can get across
again, seven feet,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.440
he can go on to
the Croaklyn Bridge.

12:56.480 --> 12:58.399
And we are home.

12:58.440 --> 12:59.559
Look at Thunder Truck!

12:59.600 --> 13:00.799
Thunder Truck wants
to pick

13:00.840 --> 13:02.279
one of these brother
out of its teeth.

13:02.320 --> 13:04.159
He’s got the lights flashing
and it’s ready.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.360
You gotta make sure you
don’t slip on this part.

13:06.399 --> 13:09.399
Lily pad, no... Oh!

13:09.440 --> 13:11.440
Look at the splash.

13:11.480 --> 13:14.240
You saw Tater take a dive.
Boom!

13:14.279 --> 13:17.679
He fell in that water
like a concrete fish.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.679
Here comes Nugget.

13:19.720 --> 13:21.960
Ready, Frogger 2?
Here we go!

13:23.039 --> 13:24.679
This is basketball
on the driveway.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.159
This is video games
in the basement.

13:26.200 --> 13:28.639
The little brother trying
to finally beat

13:28.679 --> 13:29.519
the big brother.

13:29.559 --> 13:30.879
Yeah, you good.

13:32.399 --> 13:34.440
Jumping is not an
issue with Durrell.

13:34.480 --> 13:35.840
- No.
- That’s the easy part.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.399
- That’s the easy part.
- Right, right.

13:37.440 --> 13:38.879
- You made it to the easy part.
- Right.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.759
These siblings have got
something to prove, man.

13:40.799 --> 13:42.559
The crosswalk button.

13:42.600 --> 13:43.720
Got it.

13:43.759 --> 13:44.960
Green man, go ahead. Whoa!

13:45.000 --> 13:46.960
Than ankle almost turned.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.120
Watch the cop car.

13:48.159 --> 13:50.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

13:50.159 --> 13:51.320
[grunts]

13:51.360 --> 13:52.919
All right, Wayans.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.639
Durell’s coming up to
the spot

13:54.679 --> 13:55.759
where his brother fell.

13:55.799 --> 13:58.200
Can little bro do
any better?

13:58.240 --> 14:00.240
You have to be nimble enough...

14:00.279 --> 14:02.159
Oh, no!

14:02.200 --> 14:03.559
Oh!

14:03.600 --> 14:06.240
Like brother, like brother.

14:06.279 --> 14:08.399
I told you that first jump
was the craziest part.

14:08.440 --> 14:09.919
No one knows this
better than you, Damon.

14:09.960 --> 14:10.919
Sometimes you just do what
your older brother does

14:10.960 --> 14:12.440
because it’s cool.

14:12.480 --> 14:14.240
I know. I’m the older
brother, too, so...

14:14.279 --> 14:17.320
He’s got the big brother
complex.

14:17.360 --> 14:20.559
I want to go in the water
too and lose a life.

14:20.600 --> 14:22.320
Okay, so big brother Derrick,

14:22.360 --> 14:25.480
back on the bridge
for his second life.

14:25.519 --> 14:26.440
And there we go.

14:26.480 --> 14:27.600
- Smart man.
- Smartly stepped.

14:27.639 --> 14:30.360
And welcome to Thunder Truck.

14:30.399 --> 14:32.240
You’ve got about
a two second gap

14:32.279 --> 14:33.000
to get past it.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.759
Chop chop, let’s go.

14:34.799 --> 14:36.360
This is a big man.

14:36.399 --> 14:37.960
We may see a collision here,
I’m a little bit nervous.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.159
- Oh, wow!
- Derrick is past it!

14:41.200 --> 14:42.639
Oh, that’s crazy.

14:42.679 --> 14:45.120
He’s moving on.
Now, we’re at the planter,

14:45.159 --> 14:47.000
which of course those
are your sunflowers.

14:47.039 --> 14:48.320
On your hands and knees,
planting them.

14:48.360 --> 14:49.559
Yes, they are.
Don’t disrespect them.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.159
A miniscule little ledge
for his giant feet

14:52.200 --> 14:53.960
and his toes and he’s across
the planter, Wayans,

14:54.000 --> 14:56.399
and he’s a hungry man.
Here we go.

14:57.679 --> 14:58.559
[phone rings]

14:58.600 --> 15:00.879
Good evening, Pizza Rana.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.600
Green and gooey is
our specialty.

15:02.639 --> 15:03.879
What’s the order?

15:03.919 --> 15:06.159
Could I please order for
a large pepperoni?

15:06.200 --> 15:07.960
Do you want flies with that?

15:08.000 --> 15:08.840
Yes, please.

15:08.879 --> 15:10.759
Mm-kay.
I love you.

15:10.799 --> 15:11.759
Love you, too.

15:11.799 --> 15:13.080
[laughing]

15:15.159 --> 15:17.879
Okay, here we go.

15:17.919 --> 15:19.120
He’s about to fall in.

15:19.159 --> 15:20.639
This is your moment, Derrick.

15:20.679 --> 15:23.000
Show little bro
how you got to go.

15:23.039 --> 15:24.759
- That rhymed.
- That rhymed, not bad.

15:24.799 --> 15:26.360
I like that, man.
Good job, Damon.

15:26.399 --> 15:29.360
Every once in a while you’ve got
to just bite the bottom lip

15:29.399 --> 15:31.759
and say go. Now, go!
Go!

15:31.799 --> 15:34.200
Well done, Derrick McDonald.

15:34.240 --> 15:37.919
And welcome to
Jean Claude Ram Vans.

15:37.960 --> 15:40.559
These things are brutal.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.879
Now, you see the pizza
on top of the middle van.

15:42.919 --> 15:44.519
We sent it from Pizza Rana here.

15:44.559 --> 15:46.559
He’s going to have
to grab that

15:46.600 --> 15:48.960
and clear the vans.
What do you think, Wayans?

15:49.000 --> 15:50.000
Zero chance.

15:50.039 --> 15:51.720
Let’s go, bro.

15:51.759 --> 15:54.679
Don’t second guess it.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.000
- Ah!
- He’s going to-- oh!

15:56.039 --> 15:57.879
- That’s not what--
- Cannonball!

15:57.919 --> 16:00.200
He did a cannonball.
Unprecedented.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.639
Yes, sir!

16:01.679 --> 16:04.000
He said if I’m going down,
I’m going down my way.

16:04.039 --> 16:06.159
He gets clipped
by the blue van.

16:06.200 --> 16:08.000
Beautiful, freeze it.

16:08.039 --> 16:10.559
- I love it.
- It is a gorgeous double tuck.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.440
Air-tight cannonball.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.000
It is out of the textbook.

16:14.039 --> 16:15.799
Look at the splash!

16:15.840 --> 16:16.639
Oh my goodness.

16:16.679 --> 16:18.000
That’s top 10.

16:18.039 --> 16:20.080
The pressure is on
Durrell’s second life

16:20.120 --> 16:22.080
to catch up to
his big brother.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.600
Some ground
to make up here,

16:23.639 --> 16:25.799
don’t let the big brother
get the big lead here.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.279
Easy, easy.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.360
He’s like lightning
across the Thunder Truck.

16:29.399 --> 16:31.240
You got it, you got it.

16:31.279 --> 16:32.559
I just want a pepperoni
pizza, is that cool?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.639
After ordering a pizza
on the phone,

16:34.679 --> 16:37.279
he stays in top gear through
the Fast and the Froggiest.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.759
One more jump and we have
a brotherly tie.

16:40.799 --> 16:42.360
Grab it and go.
Grab it and go.

16:42.399 --> 16:43.679
- Oh, no.
- Here he goes...

16:43.720 --> 16:44.559
Oh!

16:44.600 --> 16:45.759
Just like his brother.

16:45.799 --> 16:48.240
And the nugget
has been dipped.

16:48.279 --> 16:49.440
Ah!

16:49.480 --> 16:50.759
His brother’s so happy.

16:50.799 --> 16:53.159
Let’s see those two
cannonballs side by side.

16:54.320 --> 16:57.000
You see, Derrick,
he tucks. I like it.

16:57.039 --> 16:59.720
I give Derrick’s entry
a 9.5.

16:59.759 --> 17:01.360
Little bro Durrell gets a 7.

17:01.399 --> 17:04.759
Man, this battle between
Nugget and Tater is on fire.

17:04.799 --> 17:06.039
Big time. Who you got?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.400
- Nugget.
- You’re team Nugget?

17:07.440 --> 17:09.119
- I’m Team Nugget.
- I’m Team Tater.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.920
Those are French fries.
We’ll be right back.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.160
Okay, it comes down to this.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.359
Both brothers have
one life left.

17:27.400 --> 17:29.759
Derrick McDonald,
the older brother,

17:29.799 --> 17:31.319
is now stuck in
the exact same spot

17:31.359 --> 17:33.000
from the Jean Claude Ram Vans,

17:33.039 --> 17:35.279
as his younger brother Durrell.

17:35.319 --> 17:37.440
So whoever can advance
the furthest

17:37.480 --> 17:39.640
with this final life
is going through

17:39.680 --> 17:41.240
to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

17:41.279 --> 17:43.000
Oh, here we go.

17:43.039 --> 17:47.279
He’s not wasting no time either,
I see you!

17:47.319 --> 17:48.599
Go ahead, playa!

17:48.640 --> 17:49.799
Sometimes you get that
fresh pizza in your hand,

17:49.839 --> 17:51.160
There’s no patience at all.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.720
You just want it.
You want it in your mouth.

17:52.759 --> 17:55.440
Burn the seven layers of skin
off the top of your mouth.

17:55.480 --> 17:59.279
[gasping]

17:59.319 --> 18:01.400
There is so much
as stake, here.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.799
Derrick’s studying the vans.

18:03.839 --> 18:05.359
Not going to take
any chances.

18:05.400 --> 18:06.799
Do a flip!

18:06.839 --> 18:09.680
- [gasps]
- Whoa!

18:09.720 --> 18:11.039
- Okay!
- He finally did it.

18:11.079 --> 18:12.759
Okay, great job.

18:12.799 --> 18:14.359
Now the taxi cabs.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.400
These are wobbly, so you’ve
got to be really careful.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.200
Look at him go!

18:18.240 --> 18:18.960
Whoa.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.160
Look at him go!

18:21.200 --> 18:23.119
He can finish right now.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.160
Come on.

18:25.200 --> 18:26.279
- Derrick McDonald.
- Come on.

18:26.319 --> 18:28.079
- With a pizza.
- Look at him go!

18:28.119 --> 18:30.599
[cheering, shouting]

18:30.640 --> 18:32.799
- Woo!
- I like it.

18:32.839 --> 18:34.799
Hey, yo!
Okay.

18:34.839 --> 18:36.960
That’s the big brother
fatigue right there.

18:37.000 --> 18:38.799
Big bro’s still got it.

18:38.839 --> 18:40.440
My favorite pizza, too.

18:40.480 --> 18:41.880
Shout out to all
the big brothers!

18:41.920 --> 18:42.799
Absolutely!

18:42.839 --> 18:44.039
[laughing]

18:44.960 --> 18:46.839
That was our house first!

18:48.400 --> 18:50.799
- Durrell, third life.
- Yes, sir.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.359
It all comes down to this.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.160
You’ve got to get
to the end. Here you go.

18:56.400 --> 18:57.319
Mmm.

18:57.359 --> 18:58.440
Don’t hesitate.

18:58.480 --> 19:01.000
Whoa!

19:01.039 --> 19:04.400
- Gah!
- Just grab the pizza, Durrell.

19:04.440 --> 19:05.559
- Grab the damn pizza!
- Grab the pizza!

19:05.599 --> 19:07.680
Grab the pizza.

19:07.720 --> 19:11.319
Durrell McDonald, if he
can just cross this van, he...

19:11.359 --> 19:12.519
No!

19:12.559 --> 19:14.000
Oh!

19:14.039 --> 19:15.799
It’s all over.

19:15.839 --> 19:17.880
Down goes Nugget.

19:17.920 --> 19:19.680
That’s what little brothers do.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.039
They lose to
the big brothers.

19:22.279 --> 19:26.079
27 years of arguments settled.
Right there.

19:26.119 --> 19:28.359
- Feel like your big bro?
- Nah.

19:28.400 --> 19:30.640
Oh, congratulations, Derrick.

19:30.680 --> 19:32.559
How does it feel to
beat your little brother, man?

19:32.599 --> 19:34.000
Feels natural.

19:34.039 --> 19:35.599
Like, I’m not gonna lie.

19:35.640 --> 19:36.519
It just feels natural.

19:36.559 --> 19:37.880
Don’t get used to this!

19:37.920 --> 19:40.880
Derrick, you are moving
on to the Boss Toad Bonus Round.

19:40.920 --> 19:42.039
Great job!

19:42.079 --> 19:43.119
[laughing]

19:43.160 --> 19:44.119
Great job, Derrick.

19:44.160 --> 19:47.599
Derrick, 10 years older, wins.

19:47.640 --> 19:49.079
Yes.

19:49.119 --> 19:51.400
And Wayans, the older brother,
is just celebrating.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.240
[Damon chuckles]

19:53.279 --> 19:54.559
Glorious.

19:56.160 --> 19:59.839
With that score settled,
we’re headed to Candy Frog Land.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.200
Starting on the
candy conveyor,

20:02.240 --> 20:04.000
Froggers must remove
the gum balls

20:04.039 --> 20:06.279
and take the jawbreakers
or the lilies

20:06.319 --> 20:08.000
to the candy cane monkey bars.

20:08.039 --> 20:11.359
Leaping between the chocolate
bars to the spinning S’mores,

20:11.400 --> 20:13.079
they’ll jump to
the cupcake

20:13.119 --> 20:15.559
before a licorice rope
walk home.

20:18.440 --> 20:21.480
Candy Frog Land, a crossing
that cannot be conquered

20:21.519 --> 20:23.960
welcome Ashley and Robert.

20:24.000 --> 20:26.400
I’m Ashley, I’m 26 years old.

20:26.440 --> 20:28.319
I’m from Los Angeles,
California,

20:28.359 --> 20:30.319
Both of my parents were
from the military.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.839
My brother was also in
the military as well.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.359
I grew up with all brothers,
all guy cousins.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.599
My brothers are great but
they can be pretty aggressive

20:38.640 --> 20:40.039
so, so am I.

20:40.079 --> 20:43.359
I want to show my brothers
and all my guy cousins

20:43.400 --> 20:46.680
that I am number one,
not them.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.640
I’m Robert, 45 years old.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.000
From San Diego, California,

20:50.039 --> 20:51.559
and I’m a former Marine.

20:51.599 --> 20:54.839
What I’ve taken from my
four years of active duty,

20:54.880 --> 20:58.200
those things I can apply
to my life today.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.559
My wife sent me here
for a mission.

21:00.599 --> 21:01.880
I’m here to win.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.359
I’m here to play big
and win big.

21:04.400 --> 21:07.519
’Cause I got everything I need
to take the money home.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.119
Ashley and Robert.
Wayans, what do you think?

21:12.160 --> 21:13.920
I think Robert is big,

21:13.960 --> 21:16.079
but that doesn’t necessarily
translate to success here.

21:16.119 --> 21:19.039
You’re alluding to what we’ve
been hearing in Frogger circles

21:19.079 --> 21:21.440
- known as the jacked guy jinx.
- Yes.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.480
I cannot wait to see
how they go.

21:23.519 --> 21:24.759
Ready Frogger 1?

21:24.799 --> 21:26.039
Sure thing.

21:26.079 --> 21:27.039
Here we go.

21:31.720 --> 21:33.960
Candy Frog Land, here we go.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.519
Dinner is served.

21:35.559 --> 21:37.359
Blue gumball, down.

21:37.400 --> 21:41.039
Big athletic background,
Ashley has a lot going for her.

21:41.079 --> 21:43.359
She has to keep up with
the brothers and cousins

21:43.400 --> 21:44.880
and man has she set
the pace here.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.799
Oh, man, you made that
look too easy.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.440
Her jumps are effortless.

21:49.480 --> 21:51.160
Here we go,
decision making time.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.000
Do you want to go
the route of the jawbreaker,

21:53.039 --> 21:55.279
or the slightly safer
lily pad?

21:55.319 --> 21:58.200
Uh-oh, oh, she second thought it
for a second.

21:58.240 --> 21:59.880
And did it hurt her? No!

21:59.920 --> 22:01.119
What a jump!

22:01.160 --> 22:03.920
It’s a Bo Derrick,
perfect 10 leap.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.200
Up to the Candy
cane monkey bars.

22:06.240 --> 22:09.200
Good lord, this is
a Jackie Joyner-Kersee

22:09.240 --> 22:11.960
sonic boom through
Candy Frog Land.

22:12.000 --> 22:12.960
Oh my gosh.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.480
Drop on to this
red lily,

22:15.519 --> 22:17.480
and you will set the
Krickit Crunches free.

22:17.519 --> 22:19.920
The Krickit Crunches
go back and forth.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.640
Underneath the licorice bridge.

22:21.680 --> 22:23.799
It’s 14 feet long.

22:23.839 --> 22:26.519
- It’s nine inches wide.
- Hello.

22:26.559 --> 22:27.559
[chuckles]

22:27.599 --> 22:29.039
No, I’m talking
about the bridge.

22:29.079 --> 22:30.839
- Oh, all right. Okay.
- For Goodness sake.

22:30.880 --> 22:32.400
- Has she done this before?
- Perfect.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.000
Wow.

22:34.039 --> 22:36.000
I see what you got.
I see what you got going on.

22:36.039 --> 22:38.000
She’s smart, she’s composed.

22:38.039 --> 22:40.599
She’s a triple threat, right?
Or is it a quadruple threat.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.039
I lose track of the threat.

22:42.079 --> 22:43.119
[Damon laughing]

22:43.160 --> 22:45.279
Brains, beauty, a ferocity.

22:45.319 --> 22:47.599
And this is usually right
when they fall,

22:47.640 --> 22:49.079
when we’re hyping them.

22:49.119 --> 22:52.319
- Oop!
- Oh, no!

22:52.359 --> 22:55.480
Oh, splash!

22:55.519 --> 22:57.200
Robert is so happy.

22:57.240 --> 22:59.680
That was flawless up
until that point.

22:59.720 --> 23:05.000
She got a little loose
on that licorice bridge.

23:05.039 --> 23:07.680
Ashley Lissen just
really put the heat

23:07.720 --> 23:09.960
on 44-year-old Robert Hill.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.680
He now knows he’s
in a dog fight.

23:11.720 --> 23:13.000
Good luck.

23:13.039 --> 23:14.240
Ready, Frogger 2?

23:14.279 --> 23:16.400
Ready Frogger 2.

23:16.440 --> 23:17.839
Here we go.

23:22.240 --> 23:25.000
Robert Hill complete jacked
out of his gourd.

23:25.039 --> 23:26.599
What the heck?

23:26.640 --> 23:29.519
He chucked that thing like
it was some sort of kettle bell.

23:29.559 --> 23:31.400
Yeah!

23:31.440 --> 23:32.160
Oh, yeah!

23:32.200 --> 23:33.599
He’s like the hulk.

23:33.640 --> 23:37.119
You wouldn’t like Robert Hill
when he’s angry.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.319
Pray for that
gumball right now.

23:39.359 --> 23:40.000
Ah!

23:40.039 --> 23:41.599
Oh, okay.

23:41.640 --> 23:44.359
Hulk smash! Wow!

23:44.400 --> 23:47.119
Here we go, just don’t
rush it, Robert.

23:47.160 --> 23:51.599
- He did... Oh!
- Oh ho ho ho ho.

23:51.640 --> 23:54.519
44 year old Robert Hill.

23:54.559 --> 23:55.960
44 where?

23:56.000 --> 23:57.799
[chuckles]

23:57.839 --> 23:59.160
Fun fact about Robert,

23:59.200 --> 24:01.319
he’s been collecting toys
since the 70s.

24:01.359 --> 24:02.920
No kidding?

24:02.960 --> 24:06.519
That’s the same man who collects
Transformers and G.I. Joe guys?

24:06.559 --> 24:07.920
Yeah.

24:07.960 --> 24:09.440
Imagine opening one of his toys.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.240
- Against his will?
- Yes.

24:11.279 --> 24:12.559
You crack open that packaging

24:12.599 --> 24:14.960
after 37 years
he’s been saving it?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.119
Gonna crack you open.

24:16.160 --> 24:17.319
[laughs]

24:17.359 --> 24:18.559
Make a move!

24:18.599 --> 24:20.440
I am, I’m just trying
not to make the move

24:20.480 --> 24:22.200
you made all right?

24:22.240 --> 24:23.880
Going over, going under?

24:23.920 --> 24:27.039
Oh, no.

24:29.559 --> 24:31.039
Oh my goodness.

24:31.079 --> 24:33.839
Told you.
Not as easy.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.960
Now I’m seeing the 44.

24:36.000 --> 24:38.799
He just turned 64.

24:38.839 --> 24:40.119
Oh my goodness.

24:40.160 --> 24:42.880
Robert Hill rapidly aging.

24:42.920 --> 24:44.599
Oh that was a mistake.

24:44.640 --> 24:46.359
Oh!

24:46.400 --> 24:48.160
[laughing]

24:48.200 --> 24:50.599
He’s a 44 year old koala

24:50.640 --> 24:52.200
holding on to the licorice.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.559
And now he’s stuck!

24:54.599 --> 24:55.759
Can he hold on?

24:55.799 --> 24:57.480
Ah!

25:07.319 --> 25:09.400
Robert Hill has
an uphill climb.

25:09.440 --> 25:11.119
This is some kind
of world record.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.960
It’s like he’s been hanging
on there forever!

25:13.000 --> 25:14.720
Hold on, hold on.

25:14.759 --> 25:15.960
Oh my goodness.

25:16.000 --> 25:18.920
We can save this.
We can save this.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.519
Saved himself.

25:21.559 --> 25:22.640
Ah, ah!

25:22.680 --> 25:25.000
Oh, no.

25:25.039 --> 25:27.240
Oh my God!

25:27.279 --> 25:29.640
No! No.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.279
Oh, no, it’s not over.

25:31.319 --> 25:32.799
No!

25:32.839 --> 25:33.640
Ah!

25:33.680 --> 25:35.000
He’s down.

25:35.039 --> 25:36.519
Hulk splash.

25:36.559 --> 25:37.640
[Kyle chuckles]

25:37.680 --> 25:39.440
We say it all the time,
muscles are great.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.519
- We love muscles.
- Great to look at.

25:41.559 --> 25:43.359
- Great to touch
- Fun to squeeze.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.119
Ain’t going to get you
through the course.

25:46.160 --> 25:47.920
- I love this competition.
- I love it.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.920
Here’s where we stand,
both Froggers down one life.

25:50.960 --> 25:54.839
- Two lives remaining.
- Let’s do it. Let’s run it.

25:54.880 --> 25:56.240
But a lot of action
with these two.

25:56.279 --> 25:59.440
I’ve seen so many Froggers
go over the top

25:59.480 --> 26:00.640
of the licorice bridge.

26:00.680 --> 26:02.720
It’s so much easier to
just go under.

26:02.759 --> 26:05.039
Talk to her and start saying,
so, Ashley,

26:05.079 --> 26:07.880
you’re <i>under</i>a lot of
pressure right now.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.000
[laughing]

26:10.039 --> 26:12.599
Are you feeling
<i>under</i>the weather?

26:12.640 --> 26:14.559
Yeah.

26:14.599 --> 26:15.640
Okay.

26:15.680 --> 26:17.599
- Oh my...
- Right there, that was it!

26:17.640 --> 26:20.000
This is impossible, you guys.

26:20.039 --> 26:21.680
- Not impossible.
- Nothing’s impossible.

26:21.720 --> 26:22.680
Mmm.

26:22.720 --> 26:24.039
Don’t even think about it.

26:24.079 --> 26:25.319
No, no, no.

26:25.359 --> 26:27.599
- No, no, no.
- No, no, no.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.400
- No!
- No!

26:29.440 --> 26:32.160
Okay, go.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.039
This is it, this is it.
this is it, this is it.

26:34.079 --> 26:37.559
- Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.
- We got it, we got it.

26:37.599 --> 26:39.640
And she takes the lead.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.359
Little jump over
to the lily pad.

26:42.400 --> 26:43.960
Woo!

26:44.000 --> 26:46.519
Now the oscillating s’mores.

26:46.559 --> 26:50.839
It is a giant marshmallow
chocolate mount Everest here.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.039
She finally conquered
the bridge,

26:52.079 --> 26:53.559
can she conquer the S’more?

26:53.599 --> 26:54.440
Yes!

26:54.480 --> 26:56.000
[laughing]

26:57.079 --> 26:59.240
Ooh, Robert’s on
the hot seat now.

26:59.279 --> 27:02.319
At this point I feel she has
a 5000 mile lead on Robert.

27:02.359 --> 27:04.279
I never liked marshmallows.

27:04.319 --> 27:05.680
I hate marshmallows, actually.

27:05.720 --> 27:07.880
- Huh?
- Really?

27:07.920 --> 27:10.039
Here she goes.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.359
And she is down!

27:11.400 --> 27:12.359
Oh!

27:12.400 --> 27:14.759
Never disrespect
a marshmallow.

27:14.799 --> 27:16.559
Don’t you dare.

27:16.599 --> 27:19.440
Can Robert Hill match that
performance?

27:19.480 --> 27:20.599
It’s a lot to ask.

27:23.599 --> 27:26.119
He is going under
the licorice bridge.

27:26.160 --> 27:28.240
- By the grace of God.
- Come on, big boy.

27:28.279 --> 27:30.079
And he’s crossed the bridge!

27:30.119 --> 27:32.359
Oh my gosh, this is
great Frogger.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.119
Unnecessary moves,
but I like them.

27:35.160 --> 27:37.440
He likes candy bars a lot.

27:37.480 --> 27:41.119
I love candy bars too, Robert,
but damn!

27:41.160 --> 27:42.720
Now he’s got the confidence.

27:42.759 --> 27:43.920
Get out of his way!

27:43.960 --> 27:45.079
We’ve got a competition
here, man.

27:45.119 --> 27:47.240
Oh yeah, here we go.

27:47.279 --> 27:50.200
And he’s-- oh my gosh!
That was a great jump!

27:50.240 --> 27:52.279
Now he has tied Ashley.

27:52.319 --> 27:55.640
If he makes this jump,
he takes the lead.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.319
Biggest jump of his life.

27:57.359 --> 28:01.240
The United States Marine
controls his own destiny.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.519
I am on the edge
of my seat.

28:03.559 --> 28:04.720
It’s not comfortable.

28:04.759 --> 28:06.119
Why don’t you slide
back a little bit?

28:06.160 --> 28:07.400
- All right.
- Do yourself a favor.

28:07.440 --> 28:08.599
That feels better.

28:08.640 --> 28:11.480
Will he be on the edge
of the graham cracker?

28:13.519 --> 28:15.000
And here he goes.

28:15.039 --> 28:17.279
Oh my gosh, that was
a great jump.

28:17.319 --> 28:19.400
- What a battle axe.
- Perfect jump.

28:19.440 --> 28:20.519
Woo! There you go.

28:20.559 --> 28:23.799
This military man
will not quit.

28:23.839 --> 28:26.279
He needs to put that birthday
candle in the top of the cake

28:26.319 --> 28:28.000
and then deal with
the licorice bridge.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.079
Can this Frogger finish?

28:30.119 --> 28:31.920
- Ah!
- Yes!

28:31.960 --> 28:32.960
Woo-hoo!

28:33.000 --> 28:34.240
Yeah, that hurt.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.000
Do not forget to
light the birthday candle.

28:36.039 --> 28:39.519
Now we have a 14 and a half foot
licorice bridge.

28:39.559 --> 28:41.319
Less than a foot wide.

28:41.359 --> 28:43.480
Wayans, read us a list again
of all those Froggers

28:43.519 --> 28:45.200
who have conquered
Candy Frog Land.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.000
- Uh, it says right here...
- Yeah.

28:47.039 --> 28:48.599
One, two, three, four, five...

28:48.640 --> 28:49.640
Zero.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.640
Zero people.
Zero Froggers.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.359
It’s never been done.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.799
Look at this, look at
the focus in his face.

28:56.839 --> 28:59.559
He thought he had settled the
score with this licorice bridge.

28:59.599 --> 29:01.519
It is now back to haunt him.

29:01.559 --> 29:03.200
[gasps]

29:05.839 --> 29:07.440
And he’s made it!

29:07.480 --> 29:08.680
[grunts]

29:08.720 --> 29:12.880
Robert Hill becomes the
first Frogger in history

29:12.920 --> 29:16.200
- to finish Candy Frog Land.
- Woo!

29:16.240 --> 29:18.480
Good job.
Good job.

29:18.519 --> 29:19.599
Woo!

29:19.640 --> 29:21.559
With Robert Hill completing,

29:21.599 --> 29:24.039
we have a Frogger first.

29:24.079 --> 29:26.839
Every Boss Toad Bonus Round

29:26.880 --> 29:29.839
finalist is a conqueror
of their crossing.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.759
This is shaping up to be
an absolute battle

29:32.799 --> 29:35.480
of the titans.

29:35.519 --> 29:37.119
How do you feel when
you stare upon

29:37.160 --> 29:39.079
the Golden Fanny Pack, Wayans?

29:39.119 --> 29:42.720
Like a winner seated in glory.

29:42.759 --> 29:47.200
The Fanny Pack was discovered
in third century Mesopotamia.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.839
The natives mistook it
for a god

29:49.880 --> 29:53.519
and worshipped it for centuries
at the foot of the fanny.

29:53.559 --> 29:57.880
And very soon, it shall belong
to one of our Froggers.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.160
All right, Kyle,
think quick.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.119
Frogs state capitals.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.400
Three, two, one, go.

30:13.440 --> 30:14.839
Swamp Lake City.

30:14.880 --> 30:16.680
Springfield.

30:16.720 --> 30:17.680
Toadpeka.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.680
Croakahoma City.

30:19.720 --> 30:21.279
BossToad, Massachusetts.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.960
- Disallowed!
- Why?

30:23.000 --> 30:25.279
What’s the matter? That’s
a pretty good run at Boston.

30:25.319 --> 30:26.640
I just don’t like
being reminded of Boss Toad,

30:26.680 --> 30:28.559
you know what I mean?

30:28.599 --> 30:30.559
I already hate him.

30:30.599 --> 30:35.359
Legend had it he’s older than
the game of "Frogger" itself.

30:36.519 --> 30:39.920
He last bathed in 1984.

30:41.200 --> 30:44.680
He is a collector
of clown costumes.

30:44.720 --> 30:48.119
He is Boss Toad.

30:49.720 --> 30:53.119
A toad whose capacity
for evil is only equaled

30:53.160 --> 30:55.079
by his capacity
for stench.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.680
Take a deep breath,
hold your nose, folks,

30:57.720 --> 31:02.079
because here comes
that stanky man, Boss Toad.

31:02.119 --> 31:03.599
[Boss Toad growls]

31:03.640 --> 31:06.319
Boss Toad has
frognapped five froglets

31:06.359 --> 31:08.680
and hidden then
across the most challenging

31:08.720 --> 31:10.319
crossing of them all,

31:10.359 --> 31:11.880
Boss Toad’s Temple.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.279
Our Froggers each get
five minutes to rescue

31:14.319 --> 31:16.079
those froglets, as many
as they can.

31:16.119 --> 31:18.279
Froggers start in
the middle of the crossing,

31:18.319 --> 31:20.880
and they can choose any route
they want to get the job done.

31:20.920 --> 31:23.440
But they only have one life
so if they fall in,

31:23.480 --> 31:24.960
Game over.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.359
Taking on Boss Toad tonight,

31:27.400 --> 31:30.640
Robert the candy
destroying marine.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.319
Derrick the human cannonball
who blasted past his brother

31:34.359 --> 31:37.920
but first, it’s Joe
who sped through space

31:37.960 --> 31:39.680
faster than a speeding rocket.

31:39.720 --> 31:43.400
Joe Castagna.
Get ready for a missile, Wayans.

31:43.440 --> 31:45.599
This guy goes.

31:51.920 --> 31:54.480
Oh, yes. I told you
Joe will go fast.

31:54.519 --> 31:57.039
Speed is never going
to be a problem.

31:57.079 --> 31:59.279
He is into the mouth
of the venus frog trap.

31:59.319 --> 32:01.279
- Oh.
- Oh, be careful there!

32:01.319 --> 32:03.279
Unconventional route here.

32:03.319 --> 32:04.680
Bam.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.240
All right, baby frog.

32:06.279 --> 32:07.519
I’m sending you home.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.359
Wait for me baby,
I’m coming.

32:09.400 --> 32:11.279
Now, hold on,
is he going to finish this...

32:11.319 --> 32:12.519
I think he’s leaving
that froglet

32:12.559 --> 32:15.079
on Gillagreen’s island
for later.

32:15.119 --> 32:16.880
Interesting, but
zero on the scoreboard.

32:16.920 --> 32:18.200
It doesn’t count unless
you put it in the basinet.

32:18.240 --> 32:19.839
You are not wrong
about that.

32:19.880 --> 32:23.039
Let’s remember, he is giving
up six inches and 40 pounds

32:23.079 --> 32:25.759
to his competition here
on the Boss Toad Temple.

32:25.799 --> 32:26.880
Oh, what a jump!

32:26.920 --> 32:28.880
Look at that.

32:28.920 --> 32:30.359
Harriet!

32:30.400 --> 32:32.079
He’s taking abuse over here.

32:32.119 --> 32:34.480
Joe’s going to leave
flesh and bone

32:34.519 --> 32:36.279
on the temple.

32:36.319 --> 32:37.720
And here comes another one.

32:37.759 --> 32:38.799
Joe!

32:38.839 --> 32:39.920
Ah!

32:41.599 --> 32:44.680
The 40 year old dad
who shocked us all

32:44.720 --> 32:46.880
by smashing space.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.480
Can he do the same here

32:48.519 --> 32:51.400
and take home the
Golden Fanny Pack?

32:51.440 --> 32:53.519
And he’s approaching
the two minute mark

32:53.559 --> 32:56.279
still with a zero but
he could score very quickly.

32:56.319 --> 32:58.480
Here we go, taking
you home to mama.

32:58.519 --> 32:59.680
Here we go.

32:59.720 --> 33:01.599
Hopper Chopper 1000.

33:01.640 --> 33:04.400
Oh, yeah.
Yippie-kay-ay, motherfrogger.

33:04.440 --> 33:07.480
- Oh, boy.
- All right.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.279
Oh!

33:08.319 --> 33:09.720
Right on the tailbone.

33:09.759 --> 33:11.480
I felt that one
in the backseat.

33:11.519 --> 33:14.079
All right, so remember,
he left one behind,

33:14.119 --> 33:16.000
- and there it is.
- Two in the bank.

33:18.920 --> 33:21.599
This is a really
Wile E. Coyote here.

33:21.640 --> 33:25.319
If h can get to the third,
it’s a big leap.

33:25.359 --> 33:26.640
Oh!

33:26.680 --> 33:27.920
Wait to commit the body.

33:27.960 --> 33:29.960
Somebody save Joe
from himself!

33:30.000 --> 33:32.359
All right, back to Harriet.

33:32.400 --> 33:34.000
- Yeah, baby!
- Yeah, baby!

33:34.039 --> 33:35.440
Wayans, you know
what this means?

33:35.480 --> 33:36.279
He’s going to go
to Toad Temple!

33:36.319 --> 33:38.279
He, man, I respect it.

33:38.319 --> 33:39.839
And one of the biggest jumps
in the whole course

33:39.880 --> 33:40.960
comes right here.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.480
Little less than
two minutes left.

33:42.519 --> 33:44.599
Gotta stick it, Joe.
No problem.

33:44.640 --> 33:45.839
All right.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.079
Joe, well done.

33:47.119 --> 33:48.799
Oh, he’s getting destroyed.

33:48.839 --> 33:50.559
Well, he’s dealing
with those rec specs.

33:50.599 --> 33:52.000
They’re askew!

33:52.039 --> 33:53.519
Oh this could be an issue.

33:53.559 --> 33:56.880
Hold on to that froglet,
this is a mess.

33:56.920 --> 33:58.200
But we love it.

33:58.240 --> 33:59.720
[Damon chuckling]
Joe.

33:59.759 --> 34:01.400
And he’s made it.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.720
- We’re alive and well!
- All right.

34:03.759 --> 34:05.359
He’s got two froglets.

34:05.400 --> 34:07.200
He’s got one minute left.

34:07.240 --> 34:07.839
Ah!

34:07.880 --> 34:09.039
Temple tumble!

34:09.079 --> 34:10.280
Now, look out from
behind Joe.

34:10.320 --> 34:11.719
Go, Joe, you’re going
to get wrecked!

34:11.760 --> 34:12.840
Boom!

34:12.880 --> 34:14.679
You gotta go, Joe.

34:14.719 --> 34:17.440
Taking his time...
Joe!

34:17.480 --> 34:20.599
Oh no, Joe dropped
both froglets,

34:20.639 --> 34:23.400
can he collect them
and return them?

34:23.440 --> 34:24.800
We got about 30 seconds, Wayans,

34:24.840 --> 34:26.440
He might have to
abandon one.

34:26.480 --> 34:27.280
Yeah.

34:27.320 --> 34:28.480
Just go.

34:28.519 --> 34:30.480
Oh, Joe doesn’t know
how much time left.

34:30.519 --> 34:32.239
I don’t think if he knows
what planet he’s on.

34:32.280 --> 34:34.480
But he decides to go
with one, smart.

34:34.519 --> 34:36.320
If he can finish,
he can get three.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.559
Wayans, take him home now.

34:37.599 --> 34:38.840
10 seconds!

34:38.880 --> 34:41.480
Nine, eight, seven

34:41.519 --> 34:42.519
Another buzzer beater.

34:42.559 --> 34:43.800
Six, five!

34:43.840 --> 34:45.400
Joe Castagna!

34:45.440 --> 34:47.320
Om my goodness.

34:49.480 --> 34:52.079
All right, so three
froglets in the basinets.

34:52.119 --> 34:55.400
One in the water, what a run.

34:55.440 --> 34:58.239
A moment of silence for
that lost froglet at sea.

34:59.320 --> 35:00.800
Daddy left me in the water.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.440
Mmm.

35:02.480 --> 35:06.039
With three froglets to beat,
it’s time for our next Frogger.

35:07.280 --> 35:10.199
Derrick defeated his brother
in Frog City,

35:10.239 --> 35:13.079
now he can take home
the Golden Fanny Pack

35:13.119 --> 35:15.159
for the ultimate
family bragging rights.

35:18.239 --> 35:19.400
Let’s go, Derrick.

35:19.440 --> 35:20.880
Make your little
brother proud.

35:20.920 --> 35:23.800
Got to get three
frogs at least

35:23.840 --> 35:25.599
to stay alive in this thing.

35:25.639 --> 35:27.800
I think he’s going
for the little gimme froglet

35:27.840 --> 35:29.320
in that Venus frog trap,

35:29.360 --> 35:32.960
but time always a factor in
Boss Toad temple, though.

35:33.000 --> 35:36.280
Okay, so Joe tossed it
and left only to return

35:36.320 --> 35:39.800
and it looks like Derrick
who’s now pivoted around

35:39.840 --> 35:41.079
will be copying
that identically.

35:41.119 --> 35:42.519
Smart man.

35:42.559 --> 35:44.400
Derrick’s a big guy,
he’s over 200 pounds.

35:44.440 --> 35:47.280
With so many different
challenges to this crossing,

35:47.320 --> 35:50.159
we have seen it over and
over how big an asset

35:50.199 --> 35:51.679
agility is in Frogger.

35:51.719 --> 35:52.880
Way to hang on, bro.

35:52.920 --> 35:54.119
Ride ’em cowboy.

35:54.159 --> 35:55.320
Made that look easy.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.599
I will say, his height
is an advantage.

35:57.639 --> 35:59.679
All right, now, here’s where
the height comes in.

35:59.719 --> 36:01.519
He can reach the helipad
without even leaving his feet.

36:01.559 --> 36:03.920
It’s like when Sean Bradley used
to dunk without jumping.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.280
All right, look at you.

36:05.320 --> 36:07.239
You’re already there.
Let’s get it.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.079
Let’s go for a ride.
Derrick McDonald!

36:10.119 --> 36:12.880
Look at that beautiful shot
across Boss Toad Temple.

36:12.920 --> 36:14.480
It’s all in
the landing, Wayans,

36:14.519 --> 36:15.800
critique it for me.

36:15.840 --> 36:17.679
Woo!

36:17.719 --> 36:18.760
10/10.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.079
- Wow!
- 10!

36:20.119 --> 36:21.679
Move over, Kerri Strug.

36:21.719 --> 36:23.000
Jeez Louise!

36:23.039 --> 36:25.079
And we got two froglets,
one short of Joe,

36:25.119 --> 36:27.079
but we are passing
the halfway mark

36:27.119 --> 36:29.199
in our five minute allotment
on Boss Toad temple.

36:29.239 --> 36:30.760
Where’s he going, Wayans?

36:30.800 --> 36:32.480
Turtle or temple?

36:32.519 --> 36:33.800
I think he’s going turtle.

36:33.840 --> 36:35.440
And he is off.

36:35.480 --> 36:39.320
This is the gauntlet,
the gator turtle corner.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.079
I think he’s so tall,
he could’ve avoided the gator.

36:43.119 --> 36:44.480
- Mm-mm.
- Just jump with to the turtle.

36:44.519 --> 36:46.360
But can he get
to the turtle?

36:46.400 --> 36:48.199
Oh, he’s got the froglet.

36:48.239 --> 36:51.039
But get the knee up. Woo!

36:51.079 --> 36:54.280
I wonder if he chucks it.

36:54.320 --> 36:56.639
And he does, he releases it.

36:56.679 --> 36:57.800
How about the landing?

36:57.840 --> 36:59.440
- Oh!
- It’s out of bounds!

36:59.480 --> 37:02.239
Oh, no, it is
clear off the course.

37:02.280 --> 37:04.159
He cannot venture there, folks.

37:04.199 --> 37:06.719
Which means that froglet
is now out of play.

37:06.760 --> 37:09.280
Oh, no, this whole thing
is falling apart, Damon.

37:09.320 --> 37:10.719
All right, now
it’s pressure time.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.199
Big jump here, Wayans.

37:12.239 --> 37:14.280
- Oh!
- Oh, no!

37:14.320 --> 37:15.440
Oh, he’s in trouble.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.320
- Oh, no.
- Come on, come on.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.639
Derrick McDonald, holding on
for dear life here.

37:30.679 --> 37:33.960
Come on, Derrick, tap into
that big brother strength.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.719
He’s alive!

37:35.760 --> 37:36.719
That was pretty, baby!

37:36.760 --> 37:38.639
Pretty ugly!

37:38.679 --> 37:40.760
Here’s the situation,
he has to get another froglet.

37:40.800 --> 37:43.400
There’s only two left
and they’re both on top

37:43.440 --> 37:45.920
of Toad Temple,
so time is a massive factor.

37:45.960 --> 37:50.239
One minute left, he needs to
get on a motorcycle right now.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.360
And he’s doing it!

37:51.400 --> 37:52.280
All right!

37:52.320 --> 37:54.320
- Okay!
- Way to commit, baby.

37:54.360 --> 37:56.639
Oh, that’s pretty.

37:56.679 --> 37:57.880
No, this guy’s crazy.

37:57.920 --> 37:58.800
Hold on!

37:58.840 --> 38:00.199
Oh, Derrick!
Pull up, Derrick!

38:00.239 --> 38:01.480
You’re still there,
you’re still there!

38:01.519 --> 38:02.400
Muscle up!

38:02.440 --> 38:03.639
Let’s go, you’re still there.

38:03.679 --> 38:05.800
Oh! And it’s over.

38:05.840 --> 38:06.639
What a run!

38:06.679 --> 38:09.280
Boss Toad strikes again.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.960
Another Frogger down.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.280
You hate to see it.

38:12.320 --> 38:14.519
Just as we were
saying we’re impressed,

38:14.559 --> 38:16.360
it all blew up.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.280
I’ve seen that look on
other people’s faces before.

38:18.320 --> 38:20.360
That’s that I’m above
35 years old.

38:21.559 --> 38:24.480
Joe maintains his lead
of three froglets.

38:24.519 --> 38:27.000
Now it’s our final
Frogger’s chance.

38:28.559 --> 38:30.960
Robert Hill, one of the
most jacked human beings

38:31.000 --> 38:32.280
we’ve ever seen.

38:32.320 --> 38:34.400
We already know that
being super muscly

38:34.440 --> 38:36.960
can hold you back
in this competition.

38:37.000 --> 38:41.679
Can Robert Hill be the first
to break the jacked guy jinx?

38:41.719 --> 38:44.840
He knows what he’s got to do,
four froglets will do it.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.320
- Okay.
- Woo!

38:46.360 --> 38:47.079
Wow!

38:47.119 --> 38:48.280
One foot landing.

38:48.320 --> 38:51.960
Now he’s going straight for...

38:52.000 --> 38:53.639
Wow!

38:53.679 --> 38:54.719
We’re shocked, nobody goes
straight to Toad Temple.

38:54.760 --> 38:56.079
And he’s got it.

38:56.119 --> 38:57.920
This is totally unprecedented.

38:57.960 --> 38:59.119
Unconventional.

38:59.159 --> 39:00.760
If he can get through
this, Wayans,

39:00.800 --> 39:02.199
he is in the driver’s seat.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.159
Clock’s ticking,
we’re on one minute.

39:04.199 --> 39:06.679
And he is at the top
of Toad temple.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.039
It’s nothing for him.

39:08.079 --> 39:10.599
It’s always different
with Robert Hill,

39:10.639 --> 39:12.920
who climbs this hill
and now welcome

39:12.960 --> 39:14.400
to the temple tumble.

39:14.440 --> 39:17.119
Keep those froglets in
the car at all times,

39:17.159 --> 39:18.400
and look out.

39:18.440 --> 39:19.679
Look out, look out!
The ball of doom.

39:19.719 --> 39:20.599
[Kyle chuckles]

39:20.639 --> 39:21.559
He is a beast.

39:21.599 --> 39:22.960
Oh, no, did he lose
a froglet?

39:23.000 --> 39:24.519
He lost a froglet.

39:24.559 --> 39:26.400
It’s right in front of him,
he can still regain it

39:26.440 --> 39:28.400
pick it back up and get it home,

39:28.440 --> 39:30.360
but if he falls in,
it’s over.

39:31.960 --> 39:32.800
Come here.

39:32.840 --> 39:33.719
He got it.

39:33.760 --> 39:35.559
Great, that’s composure.

39:35.599 --> 39:37.119
He’s so big!

39:37.159 --> 39:38.719
These jumps are so
easy for him.

39:38.760 --> 39:40.400
It’s incredible.

39:40.440 --> 39:41.360
Nice!

39:41.400 --> 39:44.119
- Okay, toss, toss.
- Toss.

39:44.159 --> 39:46.639
Now, those don’t count
until they’re in the basinet.

39:46.679 --> 39:47.800
He’s about to toss
a third one, Damon.

39:47.840 --> 39:50.840
Oh, my goodness.

39:50.880 --> 39:52.079
Does he finish business?

39:52.119 --> 39:53.159
I would finish business.

39:53.199 --> 39:54.360
You have to.

39:54.400 --> 39:56.599
Nice, nice.
All right, watch this.

39:56.639 --> 39:58.719
Bing, bang.

39:58.760 --> 40:01.000
And boom.

40:01.039 --> 40:02.440
Love it.

40:02.480 --> 40:04.079
Boss Toad is furious
right now.

40:05.880 --> 40:07.480
Three froglets in.

40:07.519 --> 40:09.000
He’s not certain of anything,
he doesn’t have

40:09.039 --> 40:10.320
a clock down there

40:10.360 --> 40:11.719
so he wants to go put
this thing to bed

40:11.760 --> 40:14.199
with the fourth or
even fifth froglet.

40:14.239 --> 40:15.840
Can’t leave without
the helicopter.

40:15.880 --> 40:18.000
Oh!

40:18.039 --> 40:19.239
Gosh.

40:19.280 --> 40:20.920
That hurt my ribs.

40:20.960 --> 40:22.159
Mm-hmm.

40:22.199 --> 40:24.079
Now he’s past
the halfway mark,

40:24.119 --> 40:25.599
on the five minute allotment.

40:25.639 --> 40:27.280
High stakes Frogger here.

40:29.559 --> 40:32.159
This is one of our
very oldest Froggers

40:32.199 --> 40:34.360
in the entire competition.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.840
One life, one run,
one chance.

40:36.880 --> 40:37.719
What a player.

40:37.760 --> 40:39.119
Absolutely.

40:39.159 --> 40:40.960
I mean, this is just
beautiful to watch.

40:41.000 --> 40:42.480
First class Frogger.

40:42.519 --> 40:45.679
All right, now that is the
de facto winning froglet.

40:45.719 --> 40:47.679
Right at home on the chopper,

40:47.719 --> 40:49.360
go for a ride, my friend.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.280
Damn!

40:51.320 --> 40:53.320
This guy’s an action hero!

40:53.360 --> 40:54.440
Wow.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.400
- And this is for the win.
- This is four.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.840
Robert Hill, that’s $10,000!

40:58.880 --> 41:00.920
He takes it home.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.800
Wow! What a competitor!

41:02.840 --> 41:04.079
What a beast!

41:04.119 --> 41:07.000
- What a Frogger.
- He’s not done!

41:07.039 --> 41:08.639
Why not?
He’s got plenty of time.

41:08.679 --> 41:11.079
There’s a fifth froglet out
there, he wants that thing.

41:11.119 --> 41:13.719
Whoa, Joe Castagna knows
this thing is over.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.119
Marines don’t leave
a man behind!

41:16.159 --> 41:18.719
He collects G.I. Joe’s?
He is G.I. Joe.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.119
So he’s collecting himself.

41:20.159 --> 41:21.719
He’s collecting figures
of himself.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.679
A little bit vain,
if you ask me, but...

41:23.719 --> 41:25.320
Come on, Robert Hill.

41:25.360 --> 41:27.159
Oh, he almost crushed
the froglet.

41:27.199 --> 41:28.519
Oh my gosh.

41:28.559 --> 41:30.320
Okay, now we have
a race against the clock.

41:30.360 --> 41:32.079
A matter of seconds left.

41:32.119 --> 41:34.119
Come on, give us
a jump shot.

41:34.159 --> 41:37.360
Throw it, Robert Hill!

41:37.400 --> 41:38.679
Get in.

41:42.719 --> 41:44.400
It’s in the hole!

41:48.000 --> 41:49.719
Oh it almost went in,
it hit the rim!

41:49.760 --> 41:50.599
I can’t believe that.

41:50.639 --> 41:52.360
Ah!

41:52.400 --> 41:53.320
Yes!

41:53.360 --> 41:56.199
Robert Hill take a bow.

41:56.239 --> 41:58.400
When you go down and
give him the Golden Fanny Pack,

41:58.440 --> 42:00.039
can you get me an autograph?

42:00.079 --> 42:00.920
Yeah!

42:00.960 --> 42:02.199
Absolutely.

42:02.239 --> 42:03.239
And you know what, Wayans?

42:03.280 --> 42:05.519
He broke the jacked guy jinx.

42:05.559 --> 42:06.920
Snapped it.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.320
Snapped it in half, baby.

42:08.360 --> 42:12.119
Huge congratulations to
tonight’s top frog.

42:12.159 --> 42:14.519
He’s got a ticket straight
to that ultimate

42:14.559 --> 42:15.480
Frogger championship.

42:15.519 --> 42:16.440
Woo!

42:16.480 --> 42:17.800
You can look like
an action figure

42:17.840 --> 42:20.320
and still win Frogger,
just ask Robert Hill.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.719
Yeah!
