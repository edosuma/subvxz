01:43.478 --> 01:46.857
<i>Sam was here all the time.
No one loves the music like her.</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:53.530
<i>For Sam, it's a religion.</i>

01:57.534 --> 02:01.538
<i>Doesn't matter how crowded it is,
she always finds her way to the front.</i>

02:10.255 --> 02:14.510
<i>She never missed a show.
Every night was better than the last.</i>

02:37.741 --> 02:40.953
The night of the 4th,
a band was playing here, called Ex Nihilo.

02:40.953 --> 02:42.287
You see Samantha?

02:45.999 --> 02:51.588
Yeah, but she didn't stay
for the show, which was unlike her.

02:52.589 --> 02:54.550
Must've had somewhere
real important to be.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.135
Said she was going uptown,
but she'd be back.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.556
But I didn't see her again. Is she okay?

03:03.600 --> 03:06.812
Was Samantha alone when she came by?

03:06.812 --> 03:08.105
With a young dude.

03:09.523 --> 03:11.525
He went inside. Not sure when he left.

03:11.525 --> 03:14.611
Size 28 jeans?
Type of guy who might piss himself?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.196
Sounds about right.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.115
You think you can describe him
to a sketch artist?

03:18.115 --> 03:20.075
Bet you make it a habit to remember faces.

03:20.075 --> 03:21.368
But not talk to cops.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.795
Come by the station. No one has to know.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.973
Hey, Charlie. You're awake.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.018
You mean conscious?

04:28.894 --> 04:31.855
After being knocked unconscious
by your boyfriend?

04:31.855 --> 04:34.149
Okay, Sol didn't hit you that hard.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.735
Trust me. Think you were mostly tired.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.782
I'm also missing my
cell phone and my wallet.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.495
Have I been kidnapped?

04:47.496 --> 04:49.164
Okay, look. If you're holding me
for ransom,

04:49.164 --> 04:50.624
my mom doesn't have any money.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.669
Yeah, no shit. You don't exactly
scream "high-value target."

04:54.837 --> 04:58.048
We just have some questions
about what you saw last night.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.511
I didn't see anything.

05:02.511 --> 05:04.388
We know that's not true.

05:04.388 --> 05:08.141
Well-- What I meant was, what--
What I did see, I'm--

05:08.141 --> 05:10.477
I didn't understand,
and I'm more than willing to forget it.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.313
No? Why were you creeping around
in the first place?

05:14.982 --> 05:16.859
And you can drop that right fucking now.

05:16.859 --> 05:19.736
Before I rip it from your bony hands
and shove it up your ass.

05:22.948 --> 05:27.327
I-- But I wasn't creeping.
I came for help.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.497
What kind of help?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.419
Did you guys hear about Sam?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.462
Our Sam?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.094
A girl got shot in Central Park.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.140
What?

05:49.558 --> 05:50.893
Sam got shot.

05:50.893 --> 05:52.978
Is Sam okay?

05:52.978 --> 05:55.189
Yeah, she's alive.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.192
She's in a coma.

05:58.192 --> 06:01.695
But I was there in the park, I found her.

06:03.572 --> 06:04.781
Damn, Charlie man.

06:06.408 --> 06:07.492
Did you see anything else?

06:09.286 --> 06:10.287
Yeah.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.290
There was this guy standing over her.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.168
He seemed upset, but--

06:16.168 --> 06:18.754
but maybe more like he found her
than he hurt her.

06:19.338 --> 06:20.422
I don't know.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.633
I heard police sirens and then I ran, but...

06:26.428 --> 06:27.429
There was a...

06:30.265 --> 06:32.768
a hole in her forehead.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.313
There was blood everywhere.

06:37.064 --> 06:39.483
I mean, if I'd been on time, you know,
if only I'd--

06:41.610 --> 06:45.739
Instead I was dancing, and stealing drinks
and getting high.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.784
But I just wanted a good story
to tell her, you know.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.162
She loves a good story.

06:55.249 --> 06:57.000
Why did you come here?

06:57.000 --> 06:58.752
I mean, I didn't know where else to go.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.046
But, I mean, you guys know Sam.

07:02.548 --> 07:03.549
Right?

07:04.049 --> 07:07.177
You might know why she made plans
to hang out and then just took off?

07:07.177 --> 07:10.013
Why she left me at that club

07:10.013 --> 07:12.432
and then went somewhere
we'd never gone before and got shot?

07:13.475 --> 07:15.018
Please, you guys have to help me.

07:15.018 --> 07:19.773
I-I have no one else. My--
My mom, she'll just ground me forever.

07:19.773 --> 07:23.193
My therapist will just tell me
that I'm trying to save Sam

07:23.193 --> 07:24.903
because I couldn't save my dad, or some--

07:24.903 --> 07:26.238
What happened to your dad?

07:30.951 --> 07:31.952
He...

07:33.287 --> 07:35.747
He died in North Tower.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.084
Oh, fuck.

07:49.761 --> 07:50.762
Charlie man?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.433
You came to the right place.
We're gonna figure this out.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.451
I can't believe
I let you talk me into this.

08:12.451 --> 08:14.161
It's Bruno. You love Bruno.

08:15.412 --> 08:18.916
Bruno loves Bruno. He's my gallerist.

08:18.916 --> 08:21.585
He only cares about one thing
and that is art he can sell.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.796
And he brought Jenny.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.466
Gallery girls are the fucking worst.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.676
How they fawn over you
and tell you you're a genius.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.761
That's terrible.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.722
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

08:39.394 --> 08:41.355
- This hair, though!
- Stop it.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.648
Did you do that yourself,

08:42.648 --> 08:44.149
- or did you bring somebody over?
- Please.

08:44.149 --> 08:46.068
- Professional all the way.
- Professional.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.861
You wanna know the problem with William?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.613
I'll explain it to you, Mercer. Okay?

08:49.613 --> 08:52.032
Please. He's very familiar with my flaws.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.368
He was too naturally talented.

08:55.244 --> 08:57.120
That's-- How tragic.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.747
- Stop.
- It's awful. Really.

08:58.747 --> 09:00.249
No. It's true. Okay?

09:00.249 --> 09:03.460
Everything has happened for him.
Without any effort, right?

09:03.460 --> 09:06.421
Born to great wealth.
Never needed to work a day in his life.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.882
So when he struggles,
he views this as a failure,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.051
instead of part of the process. You see?

09:11.051 --> 09:12.219
Okay, therapy.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.303
You can't blame him.

09:13.303 --> 09:16.181
His band made one album,
it helped define a generation.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.766
Then he gives up music to paint,

09:17.766 --> 09:20.269
and his first show
gets the cover of <i>Art Forum</i>.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.771
Yes, and every collector
from Miami to Beijing

09:22.771 --> 09:23.981
is fighting over his pieces.

09:23.981 --> 09:25.607
Except, there's only one little problem--

09:25.607 --> 09:27.484
Here we go. It's coming.

09:27.484 --> 09:30.112
They wait, but then there's no more art.

09:30.112 --> 09:33.490
It's coming, the art is coming.

09:33.490 --> 09:36.243
- I just need a few more months--
- This is what you always say to me,

09:36.243 --> 09:37.828
and so this is what I tell the buyers.

09:37.828 --> 09:40.247
But you know what? When there's nothing,
they look at me like I'm a liar.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.331
- Well, I--
- Actually,

09:41.331 --> 09:44.126
I'm usually the one
on the phone dealing with the clients.

09:44.126 --> 09:45.711
You must have something
you're ready to show them.

09:45.711 --> 09:50.299
He spends all of his time in the studio.
He's there every day for hours?

09:50.299 --> 09:52.551
There are some things
that I am working on, yes.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.430
There are ideas. They're more like--
More of concepts, really.

09:56.430 --> 10:00.142
I am very excited for them
to reach their potential.

10:00.642 --> 10:03.937
But, as I've said,
I need a little more time.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.565
No. Look, there is no more time, okay?

10:06.565 --> 10:09.693
Please. William,
people are starting to ask me if you died.

10:09.693 --> 10:13.030
What a bastard. Hey!
The more pent-up demand is, right?

10:13.030 --> 10:15.824
- The higher the price is.
- Come on. He's just being modest.

10:15.824 --> 10:19.620
He never thinks
anything he does is any good.

10:19.620 --> 10:21.830
Okay, well, we will be the judge of that.

10:21.830 --> 10:23.207
Ben.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.834
- What does that mean? What are you doing?
- What? We're leaving.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.461
- Where are we going?
- We're going to the studio.

10:27.461 --> 10:30.506
We all must see what it is
that you have been creating.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.382
I'm gonna get an espresso first, though.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.885
Look, everyone is here
because we are rooting for you.

10:34.885 --> 10:36.178
All right? We love you, William.

10:36.178 --> 10:37.471
- Would you like anything else?
- No.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.435
- Come on. Let's go.
- Go, get a cab.

10:43.435 --> 10:45.312
I'll meet you outside, okay?
I'm gonna hit the head.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.396
Okay.

10:57.032 --> 11:01.954
My mom has night terrors.
Like, dreams where I die.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.874
So it's hard for her to even let me
go to school, you know?

11:09.002 --> 11:10.462
Which means she hated Sam.

11:12.089 --> 11:14.091
'Cause Sam pulled me into the world.

11:14.091 --> 11:20.180
Into Sam's world,
which is not exactly risk-free.

11:26.270 --> 11:29.314
So what happened was basically
Ramona Weisbarger's worst nightmare,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.694
except it happened to Sam.

11:36.572 --> 11:37.823
No thanks to me.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.950
You really think
you could have protected her?

11:41.034 --> 11:43.996
- Taken down a guy with a gun?
- No. I--

11:44.913 --> 11:47.666
But I would have taken a bullet
for her if I was there.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.127
Guilt.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.797
Explains why you've been
carrying this around.

11:55.465 --> 11:57.092
Charlie, the Prophet.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.970
No. I haven't even read it.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.557
I'm not sure
if I'd even believe it if I did. But...

12:05.475 --> 12:09.146
presumably, there's something
about forgiveness in there.

12:09.730 --> 12:11.023
That's what you need right now?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
So bad I can hardly breathe.

12:14.985 --> 12:18.697
Oh, Charlie. Okay, close your eyes.

12:21.742 --> 12:27.164
You think of Samantha.
Let the thought of her fill you up.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.086
Now, open your eyes.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.591
Look at me. Right at me. Don't look away.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.054
The Bible says that all sinners
who truly repent,

12:42.721 --> 12:46.517
shall be granted great mercy
and forgiven all offenses.

12:48.060 --> 12:51.063
Doesn't matter what we've done,
or why we did it.

12:51.647 --> 12:53.524
This is the law of God.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.444
Now, I'm no priest.

12:58.028 --> 13:00.531
Just a kid who paid attention
in Sunday school.

13:00.531 --> 13:03.325
But I am the only other guy here,

13:03.325 --> 13:06.662
which means the job of absolution
falls on me.

13:08.622 --> 13:13.710
Charlie Weisbarger, I absolve you.

13:13.710 --> 13:17.422
You are absolved.

13:20.551 --> 13:23.512
Hey, kid, what happened to Sam
is not your fault. You hear me?

13:25.347 --> 13:26.557
Say it.

13:29.268 --> 13:32.145
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Nah, a little more like you mean it.

13:33.814 --> 13:35.399
What happened to Sam was not my fault.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.442
You stand up and yell it.

13:38.569 --> 13:40.612
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Yell it.

13:40.612 --> 13:42.531
- What happened to Sam was not my fault.
- Louder!

13:42.531 --> 13:44.992
What happened to Sam was not my fault!

14:03.302 --> 14:05.053
Obviously, it's living
in a theoretical space.

14:05.637 --> 14:09.516
Just beginning its life journey
into a more tangible form.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.727
So that's a stop sign?

14:11.727 --> 14:17.774
I mean, it was a stop sign,
but now it is a "spot" sign.

14:21.403 --> 14:23.113
Come on. Yo, just--

14:23.697 --> 14:29.203
Imagine encountering this
in the streets of New York City.

14:29.203 --> 14:30.996
Yes, because the streets is the only place

14:30.996 --> 14:33.290
where anyone is going to see
this piece of shit.

14:35.167 --> 14:37.544
Do you have anything else, William?

14:41.089 --> 14:43.217
I mean,
nothing that is as far along as this.

14:43.217 --> 14:48.388
Far along as a "spot" sign?
I don't understand, William.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.098
After all the time
you've been spending here,

14:50.098 --> 14:52.267
this is all you have to show for it?

14:52.267 --> 14:54.728
Please. Mercer, please. Okay?

14:54.728 --> 14:59.066
It is obvious he has been coming here
only to get high.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.443
Not to mention
that you are high right now, huh?

15:01.443 --> 15:04.571
Yeah. See? You have wasted my time.

15:05.155 --> 15:08.116
But worse, you are wasting your talent.

15:10.786 --> 15:13.914
Controversial, but I kind of love it.

15:27.261 --> 15:31.932
So, you shot up in the bathroom at Odeon?

15:36.979 --> 15:39.523
It's not like I could've just done it
right there at the table.

15:39.523 --> 15:41.024
McNally sort of frowns at that.

15:41.567 --> 15:43.735
- You said you were quitting.
- I will.

15:43.735 --> 15:48.448
I am, okay? Babe.
I really want to. I'm going to.

15:49.116 --> 15:54.121
What I want is to stop having this fight.

15:55.873 --> 15:57.916
How are we supposed to go on like this?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.424
Maybe we're not supposed to.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.804
You're going down a dark road, William.

16:12.890 --> 16:15.309
One that ends in a "spot" sign

16:16.852 --> 16:18.228
and nothing else.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.126
Regan, we weren't expecting you, dear.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.420
Try the eggs. It's like eating a cloud.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.214
No, I'm not staying.

16:45.923 --> 16:49.051
I'm just here because I thought
it might be nice for Daddy and I

16:49.051 --> 16:50.594
to walk into the office together.

16:51.762 --> 16:53.305
It's gonna be a rough day for him,

16:54.181 --> 16:58.143
since someone leaked
the pretrial arraignment to the press.

16:58.143 --> 17:00.687
I saw. Nasty stuff.

17:03.023 --> 17:04.691
And I thought people liked us.

17:04.691 --> 17:07.277
People like scandal at anyone's expense.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.404
Hi, honey.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.031
Hi, Daddy. You're not dressed.

17:12.074 --> 17:14.034
Amory and Felicia didn't tell you?

17:14.034 --> 17:17.371
I'm not going in today. Or ever.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.999
This is the first I'm hearing of it.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.669
My failing. It's a condition of
his pretrial release.

17:23.669 --> 17:27.339
No, I read the agreement
and it said nothing about him

17:27.339 --> 17:28.882
not going into the office.

17:28.882 --> 17:32.553
It was in a side memo
in case the agreement was leaked,

17:32.553 --> 17:34.763
as it was, the fucking vultures.

17:34.763 --> 17:37.307
We'll call it retirement.
I've already started planning the party.

17:37.307 --> 17:38.517
A party.

17:38.517 --> 17:43.522
The only thing more important
than your father's defense is his health.

17:43.522 --> 17:45.399
This way, he can focus on both.

17:45.399 --> 17:49.570
The lawyers can come here to work.
Everything very private, comfortable.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.410
Dad, is that what you want?

17:56.410 --> 17:58.203
Darling, it's what everyone wants.

17:58.954 --> 18:03.375
You work hard to create a beautiful life,
then you finally get to enjoy it.

18:03.375 --> 18:04.877
The sooner the better, I say.

18:06.420 --> 18:08.672
You go, sweetie. Business as usual.

18:08.672 --> 18:11.717
The board needs to see
that you can handle things. Without me.

18:11.717 --> 18:15.470
Well, I'll call you. I love you.

18:16.388 --> 18:17.639
Love you too.

18:19.474 --> 18:22.311
If you won't give me her number,
please just call her, it's important.

18:22.311 --> 18:24.479
- Once again my name is M--
- Mercer.

18:26.190 --> 18:28.650
Sorry, Mrs. Lamplighter.
I didn't realize that you knew him.

18:28.650 --> 18:30.360
Oh, really? And why is that?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.070
Hey. I voted for Dinkins.

18:32.070 --> 18:33.363
Okay.

18:33.363 --> 18:36.617
I was just stopping by to see my father.
What are you doing here?

18:36.617 --> 18:41.205
It was the only place I knew to find you.
It couldn't wait. It's William.

18:42.247 --> 18:45.834
We're having an intervention
at our apartment tonight.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.794
No. He's gonna hate that.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.588
Not as much as he'll hate being dead.

18:52.382 --> 18:53.383
It's that bad?

18:55.677 --> 18:56.970
I know he wants help.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.223
Even if he won't ask for it.

19:00.474 --> 19:03.769
So I've just been tasked with finding
any of William's friends and family

19:03.769 --> 19:05.103
who still care about him.

19:06.188 --> 19:08.232
- Yeah.
- I hope that includes you.

19:34.758 --> 19:36.176
Sam is an artist.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.054
Used this place as her studio,
or maybe a storage locker,

19:39.054 --> 19:41.640
but not sure how any of this matters.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.684
My instinct is Sam knew her shooter.

19:43.684 --> 19:46.937
This doesn't feel like a
"wrong place, wrong time" situation.

19:48.480 --> 19:51.483
Samantha wasn't assaulted.
Nothing was stolen.

19:52.818 --> 19:57.865
First shot went wide,
second one got her, but didn't kill her.

19:59.658 --> 20:02.619
Fact that the shooter
didn't stick around to verify, you know,

20:02.619 --> 20:03.662
very thankful for that,

20:03.662 --> 20:07.916
but it makes me think
that this was personal, but amateur.

20:09.543 --> 20:12.880
A shooter with a motive,
but not a lot of experience.

20:14.298 --> 20:15.299
Now, unfortunately,

20:15.299 --> 20:17.759
most of the physical evidence
in this case is shit.

20:17.759 --> 20:20.304
So, the way we find this perp is motive.

20:23.307 --> 20:25.225
That means learning everything
we can about your daughter.

20:26.685 --> 20:27.686
Got any kids?

20:31.481 --> 20:33.317
Not yet. I'm working on it.

20:35.027 --> 20:36.445
Then you've no goddamn clue.

20:38.572 --> 20:42.201
Moment they're born,
you do everything you can to protect them,

20:43.285 --> 20:45.537
and then something like this happens.

20:51.627 --> 20:53.086
Look, Mr. Yeung.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.049
This is the hardest thing
you're ever gonna go through.

20:57.925 --> 21:01.011
And everybody needs something to lean on.

21:01.803 --> 21:06.099
To believe in. For me,
I believe in a father's love.

21:06.683 --> 21:07.684
I believe in you.

21:09.102 --> 21:11.980
We're gonna find who did this to her,
but not without your help.

21:12.981 --> 21:14.733
You know Samantha better than anyone.

21:18.237 --> 21:19.404
That one's her favorite.

21:27.538 --> 21:32.251
You know, I think I heard
that music is good for people in comas.

21:33.961 --> 21:35.087
Keeps them connected.

21:40.300 --> 21:41.426
You find a cell phone?

21:42.261 --> 21:44.054
No. Did she have one?

21:44.847 --> 21:47.558
Never gave me her number,
but I saw her on it a couple times.

21:48.141 --> 21:50.769
Could be someone who didn't want us
to know who her friends were.

21:52.563 --> 21:53.605
You'll wanna see this.

21:59.695 --> 22:01.613
She calls it a zine.

22:04.324 --> 22:05.492
Was always working on it.

22:06.660 --> 22:09.663
Heading over to Kinko's all hours,
making copies.

22:09.663 --> 22:13.542
If you wanna know my daughter,
it's in there.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.347
So, how'd you end up down here?

22:29.141 --> 22:30.809
I guess because I love roller coasters.

22:33.437 --> 22:35.355
My mom died when I was 16.

22:36.023 --> 22:39.401
No dad, so I just kind of drifted up north
from Louisiana after that.

22:41.612 --> 22:44.948
Cleaned motel rooms from Memphis
to Nashville to Cincinnati.

22:45.824 --> 22:48.577
Then I heard about Cedar Point
in Sandusky, Ohio.

22:49.161 --> 22:51.955
Figured a place with
18 world-class roller coasters

22:51.955 --> 22:53.790
and a water park couldn't be all bad.

22:56.543 --> 22:57.794
But I was wrong.

22:59.922 --> 23:02.174
I don't know what you've heard
about cleaning motel rooms, Charlie,

23:02.174 --> 23:04.593
but it's a low-pay, high-risk profession.

23:05.093 --> 23:06.845
Math only goes your way for so long.

23:07.596 --> 23:08.931
And then what happens?

23:11.558 --> 23:12.809
Then it goes the other way.

23:20.108 --> 23:21.109
So...

23:22.361 --> 23:24.404
that's why they call you Sewer Girl?

23:24.404 --> 23:26.740
'Cause you were, like,
living in the gutters or--

23:26.740 --> 23:27.824
No.

23:28.867 --> 23:32.287
No, Nicky says I'm stuck
on a lower level of consciousness.

23:33.163 --> 23:35.290
I still get sentimental
about cute animal pics

23:35.290 --> 23:36.667
and my horoscope and shit.

23:37.459 --> 23:39.378
He says I can pick a new name
once I evolve,

23:39.378 --> 23:41.630
but I don't know, kinda used to it.

23:43.340 --> 23:45.259
Okay, sorry, wha--
So, what's the deal with Nicky?

23:45.259 --> 23:47.427
I thought he was, like,
the lead singer in a cover band?

23:49.221 --> 23:50.514
You don't get it, Charlie.

23:51.306 --> 23:55.644
But you will. The band is the cover.

24:04.319 --> 24:05.320
Come with me.

24:08.323 --> 24:09.408
Now.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.413
Come on.

24:27.801 --> 24:31.054
Okay. This is the band's rehearsal space,
but we're converting it.

24:31.054 --> 24:32.806
To what, you don't need to know.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.267
But all this equipment
goes into the basement,

24:35.267 --> 24:37.477
the window needs to be covered
and the carpet has to go.

24:39.563 --> 24:40.564
That's a lot of carpet.

24:41.440 --> 24:42.524
Then you better get started.

24:44.943 --> 24:46.778
Wait, I'm doing this all by myself?

24:47.821 --> 24:49.489
Was this Nicky's idea?

24:51.074 --> 24:52.993
Nothing happens here
that isn't Nicky's idea.

26:42.186 --> 26:44.313
Hey. Is that for me?

26:45.147 --> 26:47.524
It's none of your goddamn business
is what it is.

27:08.629 --> 27:12.925
He was awkward. Like a puppy.
Sweet-eyed. Smiley.

27:13.634 --> 27:15.010
Maybe some freckles.

27:16.094 --> 27:20.682
And his hair was curly.
White boy curly. A mop.

27:22.643 --> 27:23.644
Like this?

27:24.269 --> 27:25.395
That's him.

27:25.395 --> 27:28.148
Nailed it.
That kid's a fucking labradoodle.

27:28.899 --> 27:31.985
Wait. A shooting? What shooting?

27:31.985 --> 27:36.114
The-- Right outside the party.
The girl in Central Park.

27:36.949 --> 27:38.659
Poor thing was an NYU student.

27:40.202 --> 27:42.829
Mercer found her
and put his jacket over her.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.165
Well, it's like-- It was William's jacket,
'cause he borrowed it.

27:45.749 --> 27:48.377
And then when the cops found the drugs,

27:48.377 --> 27:51.255
that's when Mercer realized
that William's a fucking junkie.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.092
Is she okay, this girl?

27:55.092 --> 27:57.094
You know anything else about her?

27:57.094 --> 27:59.096
I mean, she's in a coma.

27:59.680 --> 28:02.015
And they're not releasing
any other information.

28:02.015 --> 28:05.936
Apparently she's a freshman, I think.
I don't know.

28:05.936 --> 28:07.020
She's freshman.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.856
What difference does it make, really, right?

28:08.856 --> 28:10.983
You're right. Yeah, it's tragic.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.323
Oh, my God. I'm so nervous.
I am so fucking nervous.

28:18.323 --> 28:19.783
I get it.

28:19.783 --> 28:21.034
Hello.

28:21.034 --> 28:22.119
<i>Regan</i>,

28:22.119 --> 28:25.122
there's an emergency board meeting.
We need to convene at the office.

28:26.039 --> 28:28.292
- Tonight?
- Afraid so. It's time-sensitive.

28:28.292 --> 28:29.960
<i>I can't. Just reschedule.</i>

28:30.586 --> 28:33.172
Well, surely Keith can watch the children.

28:33.172 --> 28:34.298
As we feared,

28:34.298 --> 28:37.009
the board is extremely concerned
about the charges against Bill.

28:37.009 --> 28:39.344
<i>So then reassure them that he's innocent.</i>

28:39.928 --> 28:42.055
- Can you get--?
- <i>Well, I--</i>

28:42.055 --> 28:44.474
- <i>Obviously, I have, strenuously, but--</i>
- Kids.

28:44.474 --> 28:48.645
Amory, it's William.
He's in trouble, and I need to be there.

28:48.645 --> 28:51.690
William.
I hadn't realized you'd connected.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.483
<i>I'm sorry to put you in this position</i>

28:53.483 --> 28:55.444
<i>having to choose between your father
and your brother,</i>

28:55.444 --> 28:57.321
<i>but this is where we are.</i>

28:57.321 --> 28:59.031
I'm here if you need me.

28:59.031 --> 29:00.282
<i>Goodbye, Amory.</i>

29:07.080 --> 29:09.208
If I wanted to share, I would. Okay.

29:10.292 --> 29:11.460
My dear, your favorite.

29:13.003 --> 29:14.630
- Salmon.
- Okay.

29:14.630 --> 29:17.466
Oh, my God. I cannot be late.
I have to go.

29:17.466 --> 29:19.426
But you're staying. Right, Mom?

29:19.426 --> 29:21.970
No. Sweetie, I'm sorry. I can't.

29:21.970 --> 29:23.514
I just came to make you dinner.

29:23.514 --> 29:25.432
Which we should thank her for.

29:27.518 --> 29:31.104
I told you, Cate. Give it up.
They're not getting back together.

29:31.104 --> 29:34.358
- Hey, we don't know that.
- Yeah, we do.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.946
Still, there's nothing
more important than family.

29:39.613 --> 29:40.614
Okay?

29:42.241 --> 29:43.242
I love you both.

29:43.951 --> 29:45.619
Will, just try it, please.

30:04.930 --> 30:08.642
You got an eyeful today.
Like what you saw?

30:09.226 --> 30:13.605
I didn't not like it.
I just don't understand.

30:13.605 --> 30:17.776
You're Sol's girl, right?
So, are you with Nicky too, or what?

30:18.735 --> 30:22.781
I won't apologize for not conforming
to your delicate suburban sensibilities.

30:22.781 --> 30:25.909
Monogamy is just a tool of
patriarchal capitalism.

30:26.660 --> 30:30.330
That sounds exactly like something
that Sam would say,

30:30.330 --> 30:32.499
and that I would, like,
pretend to understand.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.667
Sam is a believer.

30:34.209 --> 30:36.044
A believer in what, sleeping around?

30:36.545 --> 30:39.840
If you ask me, Sammy's saving herself.

30:41.925 --> 30:42.926
For what?

30:44.845 --> 30:47.764
Who knows? Could be you, Charlie man.

30:48.932 --> 30:51.059
Hey. Come over here.

30:52.269 --> 30:55.981
When we started this revolution,
we knew it would have a cost.

30:55.981 --> 31:00.986
And tonight, we celebrate
a wounded warrior fighting for her life.

31:01.612 --> 31:03.655
To Sam. Tonight's for her.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.116
- To Sammy.
- To Sam.

31:06.116 --> 31:07.618
- To Sammy.
- Sam.

31:10.078 --> 31:13.582
What's for Sam? What are we doing?

31:17.794 --> 31:19.338
We don't even know this fucking kid.

31:19.922 --> 31:23.008
He has had a rather rapid ascent
into our good graces,

31:23.008 --> 31:24.843
but what does he bring
to the table, really?

31:24.843 --> 31:25.928
Sam likes him.

31:25.928 --> 31:29.806
Yeah? Well, she didn't tell him shit.
So, why should we?

31:30.307 --> 31:33.185
All right, well, whatever Sam knew,
I wanna know too.

31:34.394 --> 31:37.064
Knock me out. Lock me up.
Force me into hard labor.

31:37.064 --> 31:40.943
Whatever. I'm all in.

31:41.693 --> 31:43.695
Oh, shit.

31:45.822 --> 31:46.823
He's all in.

31:48.075 --> 31:49.451
Guess we'll see about that.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.081
The zero hour is upon us.

31:56.667 --> 31:58.001
Let's have some fun.

32:13.058 --> 32:15.727
- Relax. William wouldn't knock.
- Right.

32:18.730 --> 32:19.815
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:20.357 --> 32:22.526
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Uh-huh.

32:23.777 --> 32:27.155
Regan, this is Venus De Nylon.

32:27.948 --> 32:30.409
Hi. I'm William's sister.

32:30.409 --> 32:31.785
Didn't know he had a sister.

32:31.785 --> 32:34.079
Venus played keyboard for Ex Post Facto.

32:34.788 --> 32:35.873
Had to represent.

32:35.873 --> 32:39.376
Everyone from the original band's
either more fucked up than Billy,

32:40.294 --> 32:43.255
hates him or is already dead.

32:43.255 --> 32:46.091
Well, we who are living
will have to do everything that we can.

32:46.091 --> 32:47.509
Hello. Hi.

32:48.260 --> 32:49.261
Come.

32:51.680 --> 32:53.098
- Have a seat.
- Thanks.

32:53.765 --> 32:54.766
Hey.

32:55.893 --> 32:58.061
I just wanted to say thank you

32:59.104 --> 33:02.316
for being there for William
when no one else was.

33:02.316 --> 33:04.902
Of course.

33:04.902 --> 33:05.986
So, everyone ready?

33:05.986 --> 33:08.030
- Yes.
- Yeah.

33:08.030 --> 33:11.158
Any moment now,
William's gonna walk through that door,

33:11.158 --> 33:14.328
and he is probably not gonna like
what he sees.

33:14.912 --> 33:17.372
Because you're here to tell him
that you love him.

33:18.916 --> 33:20.626
Love makes people accountable.

33:41.813 --> 33:44.066
<i>Hey, you've reached Sam.
Please leave a message,</i>

33:44.066 --> 33:46.235
<i>or you can do it the old-fashioned way
and page me.</i>

33:46.818 --> 33:49.821
<i>The mailbox is full
and cannot accept any messages--</i>

35:00.517 --> 35:02.769
- <i>Hello.</i>
- Hey, Mrs. Santos.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.438
I hope I haven't called too late.

35:31.089 --> 35:34.801
Hello, William. My name's Earl.

35:35.636 --> 35:37.137
These good folks here gathered today

35:37.137 --> 35:39.473
because they're afraid
that you're gonna die.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.187
Would you like to have a seat?

35:49.358 --> 35:50.943
No, Earl, I would not.

35:52.194 --> 35:55.072
Okay, listen. This was my idea, William.

35:55.072 --> 35:58.408
So you can be mad at me, but mostly,
you need to be mad at yourself.

35:59.535 --> 36:02.704
Because your addiction
is diminishing your work as an artist,

36:02.704 --> 36:05.874
but your lying,
your lying is diminishing you as a person.

36:05.874 --> 36:08.752
So please, please don't act like
you are better than this.

36:09.586 --> 36:10.587
You're done?

36:16.385 --> 36:20.681
Earl here is just doing his job.
And I appreciate that.

36:22.850 --> 36:25.686
Fuck. I mean, Bruno, I understand.

36:27.771 --> 36:31.149
I have nothing for you to sell,

36:31.692 --> 36:35.487
and therefore I am of no value to you.

36:43.412 --> 36:45.122
But you, babe.

36:49.334 --> 36:50.335
You?

36:52.171 --> 36:54.298
Did you really think this was gonna work?

36:55.382 --> 36:57.050
He didn't think this would work.

36:57.050 --> 36:59.678
He's just running out of ways
to show you that he loves you.

37:01.805 --> 37:03.849
Who are you exactly?

37:03.849 --> 37:06.393
Don't-- Please don't do that.

37:08.437 --> 37:09.855
I'm impressed.

37:11.857 --> 37:13.358
Hey, Reegs.

37:14.651 --> 37:18.906
What-- What has it been, 15 years, right?

37:18.906 --> 37:20.616
Yeah. Give or take.

37:21.450 --> 37:22.451
Wow.

37:23.827 --> 37:25.579
That's how long it took me to find you.

37:27.956 --> 37:29.082
Really?

37:29.082 --> 37:33.504
Don't do that. Don't go. No.

37:35.088 --> 37:36.423
I miss you.

37:36.423 --> 37:39.843
- Oh, my God.
- No, I miss you so much.

37:39.843 --> 37:44.223
- I can't do this right now. I can't.
- I never stopped missing you.

37:44.223 --> 37:46.058
I wasn't that hard to find.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.520
- So whatever this is...
- No.

37:51.271 --> 37:54.566
- I was in a band. We made an album.
- I know.

37:54.566 --> 37:59.112
I had a show at a gallery
that was reviewed

37:59.112 --> 38:01.615
by <i>The New York</i> fucking Times.

38:05.118 --> 38:07.287
I was never more
than 20 minutes away from you.

38:08.539 --> 38:09.540
You could have walked.

38:09.540 --> 38:14.628
I had a family. I had two kids.
I was married. I had a job. I was--

38:14.628 --> 38:16.129
I was right fucking there.

38:16.129 --> 38:19.258
- Right where you left me. Right there.
- Where--

38:20.050 --> 38:21.343
Where I left you.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.603
I wanted you to come with me.

38:34.773 --> 38:38.986
I fucking begged you to come with me.
I just wanted to protect you.

38:39.820 --> 38:42.406
I wanted our father to protect you.

38:42.406 --> 38:46.368
I didn't know what else to do.
I was hanging on by a fucking thread.

38:46.368 --> 38:48.620
I had to find a way to survive. I didn't--

38:49.162 --> 38:51.331
- Well, congratulations, Reegs...
- Please.

38:51.331 --> 38:53.250
...that you survived. You did it.

38:55.377 --> 38:57.296
Please.

38:58.338 --> 39:02.551
You don't have to do anything.

39:03.385 --> 39:06.096
I love you.

39:06.096 --> 39:07.806
I don't even know these people,

39:07.806 --> 39:10.684
but I wish you understood
how much I love you.

39:11.977 --> 39:14.062
Do you know that Dad is sick?

39:14.062 --> 39:14.980
Dad?

39:14.980 --> 39:18.233
Do you know that he would
welcome you back with open fucking arms?

39:18.233 --> 39:20.319
Daddy is a fucking coward.

39:23.989 --> 39:26.533
You are a coward.

39:27.117 --> 39:31.288
All of you, everyone here
is a fucking coward! Okay?

39:31.288 --> 39:34.208
What, and shooting dope
is your idea of bravery?

39:34.875 --> 39:36.585
You're so fucking cool, aren't you?

39:36.585 --> 39:42.090
Sounds like there is a lot to discuss.
So let's all sit and just have some tea.

39:42.090 --> 39:47.387
You see, this is why I came home.

39:47.387 --> 39:50.599
I remembered it was here.
So, thank you all very much.

39:50.599 --> 39:57.397
William, you can change your whole life
right now with just one decision.

39:57.397 --> 40:01.401
Please, William,
will you just listen to him?

40:01.401 --> 40:03.904
- I'm begging you. You'll thank me--
- Shut up! Please stop!

40:03.904 --> 40:05.781
Stop. Mercer.

40:11.370 --> 40:17.000
So, if I leave with Earl here,
it's the only way you'll love me?

40:18.043 --> 40:19.711
I don't want that kind of love.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.924
No, thank you. I don't want that.

40:44.194 --> 40:45.445
I'm so sorry.

41:00.043 --> 41:01.545
<i>Hey, Tony. How you doing?</i>

41:01.545 --> 41:04.173
Listen, I'm heading to Aspen
with the family tonight.

41:04.173 --> 41:06.425
I could drop the paperwork on the way.

41:06.425 --> 41:09.720
Yeah, thank you. Is that gonna work?
I got it with me.

41:10.554 --> 41:12.890
Okay. All right, great.
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

41:37.831 --> 41:38.874
Looking for something?

41:40.209 --> 41:41.627
I'm guessing you want this back.

41:44.546 --> 41:45.547
I'm Sam.

41:51.303 --> 41:53.388
- Hey, Sam.
- Hi.

42:33.470 --> 42:35.806
This is so wrong. Let's go anywhere else.

42:35.806 --> 42:38.475
- No.
- There's a W in Union Square.

42:38.475 --> 42:41.186
This is way more fun.
There are no boys allowed after 11:00.

42:41.186 --> 42:42.271
- Boys?
- Yes.

42:42.896 --> 42:43.897
Sam.

43:10.799 --> 43:11.800
Okay.

43:12.718 --> 43:17.139
Your roommate's panda fetish
isn't making this any less weird.

43:17.681 --> 43:19.808
She's in Des Moines for the holidays,

43:19.808 --> 43:22.728
- so you can focus on me, not her.
- Okay.

43:22.728 --> 43:24.688
What about you? What are you into?

43:25.189 --> 43:27.316
'Cause it looks like you
don't even live here.

43:28.233 --> 43:31.945
I'm into you. And you know where I live.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.622
Speaking of...

43:41.622 --> 43:42.706
Yeah?

43:42.706 --> 43:45.375
Now that I know you, I realized I don't--

43:47.669 --> 43:51.507
I don't really know you.
A married finance guy.

43:54.676 --> 43:56.553
How did you end up on my doorstep?

44:01.391 --> 44:03.560
You're not the only one with secrets.

44:05.145 --> 44:07.773
Who, me? I'm an open book.

44:15.197 --> 44:19.034
That's the biggest lie you've told yet.
Look how easily it came.

44:19.868 --> 44:23.080
- Tell me who you work for.
- No one. I'm self-employed.

44:24.122 --> 44:25.666
Everyone answers to someone.

44:45.894 --> 44:47.145
Hi.

44:47.145 --> 44:48.063
Hey.

44:49.356 --> 44:50.357
That's my door.

44:50.357 --> 44:54.778
Right.

44:55.279 --> 44:56.613
Panda lover from Des Moines.

44:57.698 --> 44:58.991
I'm a friend of Samantha's.

44:58.991 --> 45:03.704
I was just wondering if you knew
how she's doing,

45:03.704 --> 45:05.455
or if you've seen her
in the last couple of days.

45:05.455 --> 45:09.126
Yeah, the cops wondered that too.

45:09.126 --> 45:10.210
The cops were here?

45:11.628 --> 45:12.629
I--

45:15.632 --> 45:16.633
Hey, can I ask you--

45:18.677 --> 45:21.263
Sam told me she was gonna
be a senior this fall.

45:22.389 --> 45:26.810
No.
She started last fall. She's a freshman.

46:02.471 --> 46:04.806
Hey. I can do lunch tomorrow. Okay.

46:04.806 --> 46:08.519
Tim, I appreciate
that you've always had my back.

46:08.519 --> 46:11.897
Thank you. We'll stay in touch.
All right, thank you.

46:12.564 --> 46:16.527
Regan,
how did the reunion go with William?

46:17.319 --> 46:21.198
It was short-lived.
And I see I'm too late.

46:21.198 --> 46:25.285
Not at all. Amory has swooped in
and saved the day.

46:25.285 --> 46:30.207
He's interim chair until we can find
a suitable replacement for your father.

46:30.207 --> 46:33.418
The board is very happy.
The ship has been steadied.

46:33.418 --> 46:35.337
Yeah, or hijacked.

46:35.337 --> 46:39.174
I mean,
you force my father into retirement

46:39.174 --> 46:42.261
and then the CEO job
just falls right into your lap.

46:42.261 --> 46:45.514
Interim. Until we can find
a permanent replacement.

46:46.098 --> 46:48.642
I'm sorry things didn't go so well
with your brother.

46:49.768 --> 46:53.522
But I need you too, now more than ever.

46:54.523 --> 46:55.524
We need each other.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.359
I'll see you in the morning.

46:58.694 --> 46:59.695
Yeah.

47:02.573 --> 47:03.574
Don't.

47:25.512 --> 47:28.015
Come on, Prophet. Front and center.

47:28.015 --> 47:29.975
- Come here. Hey.
- What?

47:30.809 --> 47:35.981
<i>Ne cede malis.</i> Means "yield not to evil."

47:37.191 --> 47:39.443
It's the motto of the Bronx. Come on.

47:50.746 --> 47:52.956
Fucking beautiful.

47:57.044 --> 47:58.504
What's the matter, Charlie man?

48:01.256 --> 48:03.550
I don't understand what we're doing here.

48:05.886 --> 48:07.930
Sam loves music. She's not into violence.

48:07.930 --> 48:10.265
- She'd never hurt anybody.
- And neither would we.

48:10.265 --> 48:12.768
It's okay, Charlie.
No one lives in that building.

48:15.812 --> 48:17.189
Then why?

48:19.566 --> 48:21.527
Sam asked the same questions you are.

48:22.569 --> 48:26.532
I tried my best to answer.
We love this city.

48:27.616 --> 48:30.285
We think it should belong
to the musicians and the artists.

48:31.453 --> 48:33.372
To the Black and the brown folks.

48:34.122 --> 48:38.043
To the dreamers, the junkies, the poets.

48:38.961 --> 48:42.673
But some very bad people
are trying to take that away from us, and...

48:44.800 --> 48:46.176
we're just fighting back.

48:47.886 --> 48:49.096
By setting it on fire?

48:49.096 --> 48:50.889
Hey, you're gonna have to trust me, Prophet.

48:52.391 --> 48:53.475
There's a plan.

48:54.685 --> 48:56.895
A plan to keep this city for the people

48:56.895 --> 49:00.107
and lock up those bastards
who are stealing our island.

49:00.649 --> 49:02.651
We're building a new world

49:02.651 --> 49:05.529
that requires the destruction
of the old one.

49:05.529 --> 49:09.283
Also, it feels really fucking good
to blow shit up.

49:09.283 --> 49:13.328
- So fucking good.
- Hell yeah.

49:13.996 --> 49:15.831
We sang songs about it.

49:21.503 --> 49:24.047
If the question you're asking is,
"What would Sam do?"

49:24.965 --> 49:29.094
I think we all know the answer.
Sam was one of us,

49:29.595 --> 49:32.097
and you're not gonna get closer
to the truth of what happened to her

49:32.097 --> 49:33.223
running in the other direction.

49:35.309 --> 49:40.647
Come on, Charlie. Join us.
Show Sam what you're made of.

49:45.736 --> 49:48.238
<i>...a person of interest
in the July 4th shooting</i>

49:48.238 --> 49:50.574
<i>in Central Park has been identified.</i>

49:50.574 --> 49:55.329
<i>Police are looking for a Caucasian male
between 15 and 25.</i>

49:55.329 --> 49:58.498
<i>Medium height, slim build,
dark hair and eyes.</i>

49:58.498 --> 49:59.833
<i>Anyone with information,</i>

49:59.833 --> 50:04.630
<i>please call the NYPD at 212-111-TIPS.</i>

50:04.630 --> 50:05.714
<i>As shootings in the park--</i>

50:06.423 --> 50:08.175
Skinny kid, bushy hair.

50:08.175 --> 50:10.552
Like a poodle died on his head.

50:10.552 --> 50:13.514
He wasn't a kid. He was, like, 40.

50:14.014 --> 50:17.392
Preppy, clean-cut, Rolex.

50:28.070 --> 50:29.905
I'm gonna go pull that tape.

50:29.905 --> 50:31.949
If it's not the 28 jeans kid,
then who the hell is it?

50:32.991 --> 50:33.992
Come with me.

50:34.910 --> 50:36.203
- Yeah.
- <i>Hey.</i>

50:36.203 --> 50:38.372
<i>The kid in the photo,
his mother called in.</i>

50:38.372 --> 50:40.207
Okay, yeah. I'll head right over.

50:51.218 --> 50:54.596
Summers in Southampton.
So many good memories.

51:03.939 --> 51:05.816
Some things are better left forgotten.

51:10.737 --> 51:12.447
- Come on, Charlie.
- Come on, Prophet.

51:12.447 --> 51:15.075
- You can do it, Charlie. Breathe.
- Do it.

51:15.075 --> 51:16.410
- We believe in you.
- Come on.

51:16.410 --> 51:17.995
- Don't even think about it.
- Come on, Prophet.

51:17.995 --> 51:19.079
Just throw it.

51:52.863 --> 51:54.031
- We can head out.
- Let's go.

51:54.031 --> 51:55.115
Yeah.

51:55.115 --> 51:56.408
Come on, Charlie man.

51:57.826 --> 51:59.578
Come on, Charlie man! Come on!

52:28.982 --> 52:29.983
Keith?

52:34.655 --> 52:37.491
So, what was so urgent
that it couldn't wait till morning?

52:40.869 --> 52:42.746
This is where the girl was shot.

52:42.746 --> 52:45.249
Yeah, I saw the police from the party.

52:47.668 --> 52:49.586
You have a special interest in this case?

52:51.630 --> 52:53.799
I was just won-- I mean--

52:55.759 --> 52:57.761
I think I know who she is.

52:58.929 --> 53:03.267
And I was wondering if you knew if...

53:05.811 --> 53:06.812
if you--

53:10.065 --> 53:11.066
if you knew about--

53:11.066 --> 53:13.610
Keith, what is there to know
about a young girl

53:13.610 --> 53:17.030
and a married man
who owes his good fortune,

53:17.030 --> 53:21.076
not to mention his actual fortune,
to his lovely wife's family?

53:21.076 --> 53:26.415
Surely such a man wouldn't mix business
with that kind of pleasure.

53:26.415 --> 53:28.375
No. That wouldn't be smart.

53:28.375 --> 53:32.504
It would be pure stupidity.
It would be dangerous even.

53:34.173 --> 53:35.424
Jesus, Amory.

53:42.472 --> 53:44.141
What happened here, is it because of you?

53:46.185 --> 53:47.311
Come on, Keith.

53:47.978 --> 53:50.731
We both know that what happened here...

53:53.817 --> 53:55.235
is because of you.
