27:04.622 --> 27:07.334
I feel asleep.

No, you must have blacked out

27:08.668 --> 27:10.296
cause we--we rolled all night.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.338
We danced like maniacs.

27:11.338 --> 27:12.672
So you're going

27:11.338 --> 27:12.672

-It was cozy.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.930
-Hmm.

that separate bedrooms.

I mean, possibly

29:21.719 --> 29:24.763
as an idea but...
