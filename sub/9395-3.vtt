00:02.302 --> 00:04.217
Previously on "One Tree Hill…"

00:04.394 --> 00:08.363
Look, I’ve got an opening in my lineup. Varsity. What do you say?

00:08.409 --> 00:10.267
- What do you want?
- What do you want, man?

00:10.370 --> 00:12.900
I mean, other than my girlfriend and my spot in the lineup?

00:12.966 --> 00:14.651
He’s got our last name, dad.

00:14.836 --> 00:16.821
I can’t change the fact this kid exists.

00:16.955 --> 00:21.609
You have no right to think of him-not today, or any other day of his life! How dare you?

00:21.655 --> 00:24.358
You’re a really good guy and I’m glad we’re friends.

00:24.516 --> 00:26.555
You and me, one on one.

00:26.605 --> 00:29.369
- So, what if he wins? What does he get?
- He gets you.

00:30.609 --> 00:31.839
This is for my mom.

00:31.992 --> 00:33.119
Luke for the win!

00:34.788 --> 00:38.541
I want to draw something that means something to someone, but I can’t.

00:41.382 --> 00:42.780
It’s too important to me.

00:43.139 --> 00:44.741
I can describe Lucas in one word.

00:45.699 --> 00:46.748
Bastard.

00:49.651 --> 00:52.089
He wasn’t swinging at me, dad. He was swinging at you.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.991
I felt like he had a piece of me. I never felt like that on the playground.

00:56.067 --> 00:59.267
Well, I say he’s taken enough from us.

01:01.631 --> 01:04.096
- You’re gonna be okay.
- Yeah, I am.

01:11.150 --> 01:12.902
Time out!

01:12.999 --> 01:15.969
Under twenty-five seconds to go, the Ravens trail by two.

01:16.017 --> 01:17.548
We’re running black for Nathan.

01:18.513 --> 01:20.807
If they double you, fight through them

01:21.355 --> 01:24.985
and take your shot when we have five seconds left. Let’s go.

01:25.528 --> 01:27.868
Ravens on three. One, two, three, Ravens!

01:28.297 --> 01:33.070
So, a quick time out and the Ravens take to the court, their undefeated record at stake,

01:33.127 --> 01:37.852
18 seconds left on the clock. They need a basket to tie, or a 3-pointer for the win.

01:37.928 --> 01:42.014
Jagielski to the inbound finds Guy Smith out top. We’re under 10 seconds now.

01:42.045 --> 01:44.564
Smith dumps it down to Nathan Scott, and he’s double teamed,

01:44.794 --> 01:47.983
but he forces up a 7-footer. It kicks off the heel of the rim.

01:48.019 --> 01:52.536
Jake Jagielski, though with an offensive rebound, with under 5 seconds on the clock,

01:52.635 --> 01:56.735
Jagielski out to Lucas Scott, he is behind the 3-point line.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.811
The Ravens are going to win or lose it right here.

02:07.747 --> 02:12.668
Unbelievable! Lucas Scott with the 3-pointer at the buzzer,

02:12.724 --> 02:17.072
and the Tree Hill Ravens are still undefeated!

02:17.102 --> 02:20.399
And I tell you what, if you’re going to play the Ravens this season,

02:20.447 --> 02:25.038
you better take note, there is a new Scott in town!

02:28.058 --> 02:28.960
Nice game, Lucas.

02:29.573 --> 02:30.465
Thanks.

02:33.860 --> 02:35.544
- You rock.
- Thanks, Uncle Keith.

02:38.696 --> 02:41.725
For a kid that was about to quit, that was something to see.

02:42.002 --> 02:44.478
But I picked up fouls too early, and I was slow getting back into it.

02:44.540 --> 02:45.591
You were great.

02:46.437 --> 02:48.729
- Thanks guys. See you soon, mom.
- Not too late.

02:48.831 --> 02:49.988
You did good, Luke.

02:53.511 --> 02:56.204
- You did pretty good, too.
- I can breathe now.

02:57.127 --> 03:01.929
Karen, hi! Keith, hi. I guess congratulations are in order.

03:01.979 --> 03:03.014
Thank you, Shari.

03:03.080 --> 03:05.072
I don’t want to keep you, I just want to let you know

03:05.108 --> 03:09.316
that as the mother of a varsity player, you’re eligible to join boosters.

03:09.633 --> 03:12.695
So, I mean, not that you need to, it’s not required or anything.

03:12.838 --> 03:15.630
And I know you’re really busy with that little café of yours.

03:15.706 --> 03:17.847
Right. When do you meet?

03:17.924 --> 03:21.123
Well, it varies, really. Usually Wednesdays.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.524
- At?
- Uh, Six-ish.

03:23.898 --> 03:28.829
So, it’s really good to see you, honey. Go Ravens!

03:45.095 --> 03:46.430
I thought this was your team.

03:58.424 --> 03:59.426
Hey, you.

03:59.995 --> 04:03.583
Oh, I think you got the wrong car.

04:03.640 --> 04:07.306
Nah. Don’t mind me. I just have to get out of this uniform.

04:07.981 --> 04:11.023
So, anyway, I’m Brooke.

04:11.638 --> 04:13.563
But you probably knew that.

04:13.860 --> 04:16.712
Can I tell you that that last shot was awesome?

04:17.408 --> 04:19.922
How’d it feel? Good, huh?

04:20.976 --> 04:22.241
You know it did.

04:25.225 --> 04:26.573
Oh, my gosh!

04:31.796 --> 04:33.614
That game wasn’t horrible.

04:35.052 --> 04:37.950
- Thanks, coach.
- Well, don’t turn pro yet.

04:38.549 --> 04:43.935
You drag your scrawny butt to the weight room twice a day starting now.

04:45.719 --> 04:46.342
You got it.

04:46.448 --> 04:52.900
Oh… by the way, there’s a half naked girl in the back seat of your car.

04:52.942 --> 04:54.682
I just thought you’d like to know.

05:00.510 --> 05:01.287
Grouchy.

05:04.458 --> 05:07.743
So, anyway… You’re in it now, aren’t you?

05:08.717 --> 05:11.184
When that last shot when through, did you feel it change?

05:11.666 --> 05:13.008
Feel what change?

05:13.744 --> 05:14.871
Everything.

05:15.822 --> 05:18.629
I mean, how many moments in life can you point to and say,

05:18.962 --> 05:20.575
"That’s when it all changed?"

05:23.043 --> 05:24.230
You just had one.

05:26.641 --> 05:30.595
But don’t worry, baby. The popularity thing’s not so bad.

06:14.561 --> 06:18.948
Unbelievable. The guy scores 12 measly points and they act like he’s Iverson.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.902
You know how many games I’ve scored more than that in?

06:22.257 --> 06:25.343
All but two. One of them, I had mono.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.365
Well, you don’t have mono now, do you?

06:29.516 --> 06:32.010
- Care to prove it?
- My dad’s gonna hammer me.

06:37.089 --> 06:40.231
- Something’s changed.
- With your dad?

06:40.682 --> 06:43.626
No, with your room. Something’s different.

06:44.184 --> 06:47.969
It’s my walls. I took my sketches down.

06:50.772 --> 06:52.315
What sketches?

07:15.642 --> 07:19.299
12 points, 8 assists. And I made the game winning shot.

07:19.529 --> 07:20.363
Good!

07:22.027 --> 07:24.674
- That is great, right?
- Yeah, it’s all right.

07:24.746 --> 07:27.501
I can’t believe I had to work! Tell me about it.

07:27.711 --> 07:30.833
Actually, the beginning wasn’t so great, I ran into you-know-who.

07:30.885 --> 07:32.801
Dan? Oh, I’m sorry. Do you want to talk about it?

07:32.959 --> 07:35.949
Actually, I wasn’t thinking about checking out the burning boat.

07:36.200 --> 07:39.005
- You want to come?
- Well, I suppose I could be seen with you.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.151
Let me just call home and tell them not to wait up.

07:46.547 --> 07:48.124
Hey, mom, it’s Haley.

07:48.355 --> 07:50.219
Haley James, your daughter.

07:51.330 --> 07:54.873
Listen, I’m gonna go out after work, and I’ll be home. Okay?

07:55.646 --> 07:56.741
All right, bye.

07:57.243 --> 08:00.167
- Was your mom drinking?
- No! I got the machine.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.364
"You don’t have to join the boosters."

08:05.543 --> 08:08.399
And did you get that dig about my "little café"?

08:08.779 --> 08:11.801
What do you care? It’s not like your going to join the boosters, anyway.

08:11.872 --> 08:13.407
That’s not the point.

08:13.724 --> 08:16.592
And that thing about cheerleading? It’s like they’re still in high school.

08:16.782 --> 08:18.732
I mean, really, let it go.

08:19.234 --> 08:21.983
Well, that’s good advice. Maybe you should take it.

08:22.526 --> 08:23.862
What’s that supposed to mean?

08:24.052 --> 08:27.882
Well, if I’m not mistaken, you still own your cheerleading sweater.

08:28.870 --> 08:31.239
All I’m saying is memory lane is a two-way street.

08:31.311 --> 08:35.135
Yeah? So is "You don’t know what the hell you’re talking about" boulevard.

08:37.357 --> 08:39.539
This is not about high school for me, Keith.

08:39.946 --> 08:42.663
- Trust me.
- Whatever you say.

08:53.118 --> 08:54.839
Hey, it’s Peyton. You know what to do.

08:57.019 --> 09:00.907
Hey, this message is for Peyton. It’s Jeff Nelson calling from THUD magazine.

09:00.962 --> 09:04.971
Your friend dropped off your sketches and, he was right, they’re terrific.

09:05.068 --> 09:07.690
Give me a call when you get a chance. We’d love to talk to you about,

09:07.741 --> 09:09.882
you know, maybe doing a comic strip for the magazine.

09:09.932 --> 09:11.566
Nice work, Peyton. Nice work.

09:13.326 --> 09:14.986
Message deleted.

09:20.859 --> 09:25.655
Come one, come all, to the Tree Hill annual Burning Boat festival.

09:25.912 --> 09:31.319
Burn your bad karma, bad luck, or bad choices and start anew.

09:31.411 --> 09:33.898
We’ll be collecting items all week.

09:34.008 --> 09:38.219
Nothing is too big, too small, too tragic…

09:38.266 --> 09:40.689
- Nice game, Lucas.
- Hey, thanks.

09:41.252 --> 09:45.927
- You are just blowing up.
- Well, yeah, man. I’m a big star now.

09:46.146 --> 09:47.509
You better hope I keep you around.

09:47.617 --> 09:50.925
You know, I’m gonna try not to lose sleep over that, thanks.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.900
So, last night, I’m watching Scandinavian week on the history channel, and I-

09:55.962 --> 09:59.310
- Because…?
- Because… blonde Viking guys are hot.

09:59.479 --> 10:04.001
Anyway, this whole Burning Boat thing is a total rip-off of a Viking funeral.

10:04.072 --> 10:04.932
Did you know that?

10:05.045 --> 10:07.845
- You know, you’re the bomb.
- Thanks.

10:08.194 --> 10:09.110
Check it out.

10:10.790 --> 10:13.657
B+! Brandon, all right! You did it!

10:13.739 --> 10:16.902
Yeah, I just threw all my bad grades into the pot. I’m not going back there.

10:16.985 --> 10:18.122
I know you’re not.

10:18.255 --> 10:21.188
I’ve had I don’t know how many tutors, and this girl’s a miracle worker.

10:21.250 --> 10:24.030
No, this is all you, man. Congratulations!

10:24.096 --> 10:26.223
Thanks, Haley. See you.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.377
Yes! I knew he could do it! Yes!

10:28.521 --> 10:30.226
- Nice work, Hales.
- Thank you.

10:31.664 --> 10:34.597
So, what bad mojo are you burning this year?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.483
I’m not wearing that on my jersey.

10:40.916 --> 10:44.013
So, we’re going to watch this together, right?

10:44.561 --> 10:47.551
Maybe. I have to check my schedule.

10:47.675 --> 10:50.234
You know, the word around town is that I’m…

10:51.500 --> 10:53.000
the bomb. Oh!

10:55.360 --> 10:56.323
Wow.

11:01.274 --> 11:02.386
Great game, Lucas.

11:06.061 --> 11:09.287
All right, I’m going to the tutoring center so I can feel superior.

11:10.439 --> 11:13.510
Oh, listen-they’re playing "Attack of the 50-foot Woman" at the Crescent tomorrow.

11:13.569 --> 11:15.189
- Do you want to go?
- Yeah. Count me in.

11:15.225 --> 11:16.532
- All right.
- I’ll call you later.

11:16.848 --> 11:18.471
Hey, who’s that girl he’s always hanging out with?

11:18.763 --> 11:21.093
Who knows? Why? You feel like slumming?

11:23.695 --> 11:26.386
- Who do you think you are?
- Someone you’re pissed at.

11:26.428 --> 11:29.106
- You submitted my sketches to THUD magazine.
- And they liked them, didn’t they?

11:29.142 --> 11:31.211
If I wanted your help, I would ask for it.

11:31.681 --> 11:35.439
Hey, girl. Hey, you didn’t happen to find my...

11:36.295 --> 11:38.211
Thank you, gorgeous.

11:44.527 --> 11:45.701
You’re welcome!

11:49.663 --> 11:51.347
- What you got there?
- What?

11:51.470 --> 11:54.891
You know what. The Brooke Davis leopard bra-dude, that thing’s like a welcome mat.

11:55.909 --> 12:00.334
- Anyway, I heard you were naked in his car.
- No. I was partially naked.

12:00.594 --> 12:03.815
At one point I had mittens on ‘cause it was cold. Oh, did you see my-

12:03.882 --> 12:07.511
Okay, focus. You’re a slut in mittens, you’re in his car. Then what happens?

12:07.901 --> 12:11.586
Well, then nothing. He was really sweet.

12:11.742 --> 12:16.190
He drove me home, said "Good night," waited ‘till I got inside.

12:16.932 --> 12:20.649
- Maybe he’s gay.
- No, I think he’s just nice.

12:21.868 --> 12:24.484
Anyway, it’s gonna be so great when he sleeps with me!

13:10.959 --> 13:13.878
I was just getting used to low-waist jeans.

13:18.925 --> 13:20.698
Lets go, ball boy.

13:24.424 --> 13:25.577
How’s things been since the game?

13:27.010 --> 13:27.994
Different.

13:28.532 --> 13:32.009
People I’ve never talked to say "Hello" to me like they’ve always known me

13:32.560 --> 13:34.219
and the teachers smile more.

13:34.958 --> 13:38.132
- Cheerleaders strip in your car.
- Sounds like the good life.

13:38.304 --> 13:41.233
- Yeah, it sounds like it, but not really.
- No?

13:41.331 --> 13:43.292
No, the team’s hazing me a little bit.

13:43.758 --> 13:47.557
Well, believe it or not, I wouldn’t take it too personally.

13:48.186 --> 13:51.069
See, we did that when I played.

13:52.068 --> 13:54.352
Unless it gets completely out of hand, just roll with it.

13:55.284 --> 13:56.446
Show ‘em what you’re made of.

14:05.058 --> 14:05.964
Nathan!

14:10.700 --> 14:14.995
I’m tinkering with the offense. You’ll be playing more small forward.

14:15.517 --> 14:17.540
Forget it. I’m the shooting guard.

14:17.996 --> 14:20.899
That’s funny. I thought I was the coach.

14:21.171 --> 14:26.623
As a matter of fact, you can call me that, and I’ll call you "small forward".

14:26.792 --> 14:32.067
Nathan Scott, small forward. Has a nice ring to it.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.820
I hear Whitey gave your spot to Lucas.

14:48.551 --> 14:50.591
Do you even care that it’s slipping away?

14:52.080 --> 14:58.547
All the work we’ve put into it, all the plans that we’ve made.

14:59.974 --> 15:01.993
All the plans you’ve made, dad.

15:02.514 --> 15:04.004
All the work I’ve done.

15:04.527 --> 15:07.353
Fine, quit the team.

15:07.819 --> 15:10.113
Hell, quit school for that matter. I’ll tell you what;

15:10.154 --> 15:12.627
I’ll give you a job working at the dealership. You can spend the rest of your life

15:12.683 --> 15:15.867
haggling over free floor mats with morons with bad credit. How does that sound?

15:15.929 --> 15:18.857
Because that’s where you’re headed, and that’s if I give you the job!

15:24.316 --> 15:26.338
I just want more for you, Nathan.

15:27.137 --> 15:30.317
More than a 9-5 and the feeling you could’ve had a better life.

15:33.547 --> 15:35.150
And, I want you to be happy.

15:36.106 --> 15:37.069
I do.

15:38.366 --> 15:41.341
But, you need to tell me if you still want to do this.

15:43.075 --> 15:43.976
Do you?

15:46.603 --> 15:47.519
Okay.

15:49.998 --> 15:51.697
But, happiness doesn’t come cheap.

15:53.556 --> 15:55.742
Hell, if it did, we’d all be smiling.

16:04.872 --> 16:09.035
Didn't I tell you that was gonna happend? Whitey’s using you to get back at me,

16:10.065 --> 16:13.065
and I apologize, Nathan, because it’s not your fault.

16:13.417 --> 16:15.727
What do you want me to do, dad? It’s Whitey’s team.

16:15.865 --> 16:16.855
No, it’s not.

16:17.532 --> 16:20.699
Whitey didn’t understand when I was playing for him. He doesn’t get it now.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.125
This is your team. Not his.

16:24.605 --> 16:26.147
What position do you want to play?

16:26.295 --> 16:28.657
- I think I’m stronger at shooting guard.
- I agree.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.028
So, if this new kid’s taken your position, he’s no longer your teammate, is he?

16:32.085 --> 16:35.316
He’s your opponent. And how do we defeat an opponent?

16:38.122 --> 16:41.215
Identify his weaknesses and attack them.

16:42.653 --> 16:45.521
Look, you guys are the ones I feel sorry for.

16:45.874 --> 16:47.646
Me? I’m going to get my minutes.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.713
But you guys have been busting your tails since the junior leagues.

16:51.271 --> 16:54.558
Now you finally get your shot and Whitey gives the starting spot to this guy?

16:55.270 --> 16:59.785
It’s not right. If you ask me, he shouldn’t even be on the team.

16:59.862 --> 17:02.561
- So then, what are we going to do?
- We’re gonna make him earn it.

17:03.067 --> 17:04.962
At least make him suffer like we did.

17:18.698 --> 17:20.204
It’s only going to get worse, man.

17:26.348 --> 17:30.064
So, the hazing begins… right on schedule.

17:31.852 --> 17:33.700
Can you smell the desperation?

17:37.899 --> 17:39.819
We all went through it. Hang in there.

17:43.218 --> 17:45.426
So, what happens if we haze this guy and he doesn’t go away?

17:45.583 --> 17:47.160
With what I’ve got planned, he will.

17:47.315 --> 17:51.067
- But, what if he doesn’t?
- If he doesn’t, I’ve got a backup plan.

17:56.977 --> 17:57.739
Hey.

17:58.839 --> 18:01.763
- Can I help you?
- I hope so. You’re my tutor.

18:02.173 --> 18:06.545
- Right. I don’t think so.
- You’re Haley James, right?

18:10.604 --> 18:13.085
I’m sorry. I’m best friends with Lucas.

18:13.401 --> 18:15.423
Well, then I’m sorry, too.

18:16.023 --> 18:18.407
- Forget it. I’ll find you someone else.
- Whoa, look.

18:18.503 --> 18:21.572
There is nobody else. All right? I’d be fine with it if there was.

18:21.613 --> 18:24.695
- If there were.
- See? You’re helping me already.

18:24.793 --> 18:29.089
Look, I can’t help you and on top of that, I won’t help you. Okay?

18:39.918 --> 18:40.696
Interesting.

18:42.160 --> 18:43.133
Where have you studied?

18:44.525 --> 18:45.883
Mostly in my bedroom.

18:46.630 --> 18:47.648
Is that a bad thing?

18:48.243 --> 18:52.528
No, just surprising for someone with your talent.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.892
Well, your stuff is great.

18:57.346 --> 18:59.235
I do have a few concerns, though.

18:59.983 --> 19:03.911
You’re younger than I expected, and we have firm deadlines to make a press run.

19:03.961 --> 19:06.286
Give me a deadline. I’ll meet it.

19:07.833 --> 19:11.387
All right, then how about a test strip?

19:12.211 --> 19:15.754
Use your high school characters, but, give them a twist.

19:16.199 --> 19:17.038
A twist?

19:17.949 --> 19:21.268
The way you portray high school, the girls are so tragic.

19:21.392 --> 19:25.190
Don’t get me wrong, I like it. But, the magazine wants wish fulfillment.

19:25.247 --> 19:29.818
- You know, pretty, popular, like a…
- A cheerleader?

19:30.540 --> 19:33.990
Perfect. Cheerleaders are always happy.

19:36.812 --> 19:40.969
Identity-this was a common theme in the work of E.E. Cumings.

19:41.799 --> 19:43.635
While it’s true he was most known as a…

19:43.678 --> 19:46.105
Lucas, what’s your favorite color?

19:46.551 --> 19:47.396
Black.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.621
B-l-a-c-k.

19:50.795 --> 19:52.648
When Cummings died in 1962, he was enormously popular,

19:53.591 --> 19:55.255
especially with young readers.

19:56.063 --> 19:57.247
What’s your favorite number?

20:00.984 --> 20:04.820
Okay, what’s your favorite sexual position?

20:08.680 --> 20:09.744
I’ll use mine.

20:16.656 --> 20:18.279
So, you like me.

20:18.577 --> 20:23.522
Mostly because he dealt with sex… and war.

20:24.444 --> 20:27.747
Okay, folks, listen up-I want everyone to bring in something by Cummings-

20:27.809 --> 20:31.565
poem, essay, whatever-to the next class. Okay, thank you for your work.

20:38.551 --> 20:41.184
Hey. I just wanted to let you know that I’m gonna be fine.

20:41.912 --> 20:42.811
Good.

20:44.469 --> 20:46.206
I mean, F is for fine, right?

20:53.839 --> 20:55.619
You know she’ll never go for it.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.585
So, how’s your Lucas quest going?

20:59.050 --> 21:01.463
Fine. Ow! Hand.

21:03.561 --> 21:07.740
Let me ask you something. Why are you being so persistent with this one?

21:07.970 --> 21:10.156
You normally would have moved on by now.

21:10.832 --> 21:13.223
- Why? Are you jealous?
- No.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.689
- Do you like him?
- No.

21:17.104 --> 21:20.985
See, there’s this guy named Nathan, who’s also called my boyfriend.

21:21.078 --> 21:23.396
Yeah-ow! Ooh. Well...

21:24.672 --> 21:29.469
maybe I want a boyfriend, too-someone reliable for once, steady…

21:31.061 --> 21:34.631
Without all the drama, anger, and pettiness you and Nathan have.

21:40.262 --> 21:40.979
Ow!

21:42.679 --> 21:45.356
- Isn’t Haley working today?
- She’s making a delivery.

21:46.062 --> 21:47.476
Doesn’t that girl ever go home?

21:48.317 --> 21:50.462
Haley comes from a big family.

21:51.740 --> 21:54.956
When Lucas met her, I think they were eight or nine.

21:56.124 --> 21:58.853
But she saw it was just me and Lucas, and she said

21:58.914 --> 22:01.940
"Yeah, I come from a big family. I think you guys need me more."

22:03.062 --> 22:05.411
Did he tell you about his troubles with the team?

22:05.801 --> 22:09.651
Yeah. I told him not to take it so personally.

22:10.788 --> 22:13.736
Speaking of taking things personally, I was thinking about my brush

22:13.768 --> 22:17.306
with Shari and the boosters. I think I may have overreacted.

22:18.062 --> 22:19.876
I think I know how you can find out.

22:22.630 --> 22:27.105
Okay, the last item on the agenda is fundraising.

22:27.371 --> 22:31.299
So, we will have our booth at Burning Boat and...

22:31.908 --> 22:35.921
- Karen, hi.
- You start at six, right?

22:37.346 --> 22:41.595
No, sweetie, we start at five sharp. You must have misunderstood me.

22:41.692 --> 22:42.573
Sure.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.811
Everybody, this is Karen, Lucas Scott’s mother.

22:47.043 --> 22:48.901
Oh, so you’re Dan’s ex?

22:49.065 --> 22:52.393
- Actually, we were never married.
- Oh.

22:53.925 --> 22:59.049
I just thought I’d come down here and introduce myself to all of you and say "Hello."

22:59.192 --> 23:02.352
- Is Lucas on the team for good?
- What do you mean?

23:02.437 --> 23:05.485
Well, I mean, it just seems strange that a new boy on the squad

23:05.547 --> 23:08.921
becomes a starter ahead of boys who have been Ravens for years.

23:10.616 --> 23:14.112
Um, now then, as I was saying, um, I think that Burning Boat-

23:14.185 --> 23:18.782
It’s ‘cause he’s good. Coach Durham thinks he deserves to,

23:18.808 --> 23:22.499
and maybe you want to tell your sons that so next time they steal his wallet,

23:22.540 --> 23:25.940
or ruin his clothes, or whatever else they have planned for him.

23:26.001 --> 23:28.586
- Excuse me?
- He’s a kid who’s doing his best.

23:28.663 --> 23:32.989
Whoa, whoa. You walk in here-late,

23:33.104 --> 23:36.906
I might add-and start making accusations about our boys?

23:37.454 --> 23:39.754
Our boys are the good ones.

23:40.952 --> 23:44.377
- Exactly what does that mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

23:45.412 --> 23:48.811
You know, Shari, I came down here wanting to give you the benefit of the doubt,

23:48.867 --> 23:55.078
but clearly you’re still the same petty little bitch you were in high school.

24:01.089 --> 24:02.431
Well, um…

24:46.452 --> 24:49.459
Hey. I heard about this.

24:50.744 --> 24:52.219
I hoped it wasn’t true.

24:53.238 --> 24:54.313
What do you want, Peyton?

24:54.984 --> 24:57.201
I just want to tell you I’m not doing the comic strip.

24:58.138 --> 24:59.510
That’s a mistake.

25:00.021 --> 25:01.409
Yeah, well maybe some people aren’t ready

25:01.434 --> 25:03.851
to expose themselves to the world like you and your basketball.

25:03.897 --> 25:06.605
Maybe you are ready, but you’re just scared.

25:18.172 --> 25:19.642
Well, did you at least meet with them?

25:19.708 --> 25:22.631
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, the editor loved my stuff.

25:22.677 --> 25:25.104
He just wanted me to change it into something totally different.

25:26.882 --> 25:28.719
It’s really not that big of a deal.

25:29.656 --> 25:32.826
Guess I just… I just want to say thanks.

25:33.670 --> 25:36.947
Wow. Did Peyton Sawyer just say "thank you"?

25:43.004 --> 25:45.139
Look, if Nathan did this, I’m sorry.

25:45.840 --> 25:47.515
Why do you stay with him, anyway?

25:49.696 --> 25:51.206
‘Cause sometimes it’s good.

25:53.111 --> 25:54.801
Sometimes there’s no one else.

26:00.412 --> 26:01.191
Hey, Peyton...

26:03.434 --> 26:04.969
that editor is wrong.

26:15.204 --> 26:17.432
- Karen’s Café.
- I’m calling for Haley James.

26:17.611 --> 26:20.160
- Yeah, this is her.
- Hey, it’s Nathan Scott.

26:22.489 --> 26:24.231
I really need your help.

26:24.625 --> 26:25.900
Sorry, this isn’t her.

26:29.223 --> 26:31.363
- What was that?
- Wrong number.

26:32.279 --> 26:34.594
You just said this was her. What, did you forget your own name?

26:39.000 --> 26:40.442
What’s up?

26:42.013 --> 26:48.050
This guy wants me to tutor him, and I said "No" ‘cause he’s kind of a bad guy.

26:48.214 --> 26:48.961
You know him?

26:49.755 --> 26:51.154
Not really. I just know of him.

26:51.465 --> 26:52.189
Dangerous?

26:52.791 --> 26:53.344
No.

26:56.345 --> 26:59.228
- What? You’ve got that look.
- What look?

26:59.292 --> 27:04.066
The look that my mom always gets when she wants to throw her two cents in. What?

27:04.382 --> 27:09.130
Well, Haley, I think you have pretty good instincts so I’m not trying to tell you what to do,

27:09.369 --> 27:13.559
but just to play devil’s advocate, if this boy came for tutoring,

27:13.614 --> 27:15.503
maybe he’s trying to change.

27:19.529 --> 27:22.344
Might be something in there worth saving.

27:30.494 --> 27:32.421
Well, Luke, I owe you an apology.

27:33.034 --> 27:33.879
For what?

27:34.485 --> 27:36.399
I told you not to take things personally,

27:36.623 --> 27:38.226
but they’re making it personal.

27:39.501 --> 27:40.899
All right, let’s give her a try.

27:45.206 --> 27:46.746
Sorry, we’re closed.

27:52.758 --> 27:53.970
Hi, I’m Jake.

27:54.678 --> 27:57.273
- Oh, hi, Jake. I’m Keith.
- How are you doing?

27:58.195 --> 28:00.411
I got some paperwork to do. See you.

28:03.826 --> 28:06.423
- I heard about the court.
- You heard about it, or you were there?

28:06.520 --> 28:09.669
Hey, I don’t buy into that mob rule nonsense, all right.

28:09.730 --> 28:11.738
I play defense. I live my life. That’s it.

28:11.866 --> 28:13.233
Yeah, and what about the rest of the team?

28:13.872 --> 28:16.463
Look, Luke, the guys on the team-they’re in a tough spot.

28:16.708 --> 28:19.310
Because of the suspension, most of these guys are younger,

28:19.454 --> 28:21.194
and they’re not going to stand up to Nathan.

28:21.798 --> 28:23.939
It’s not right, but that’s the way it is.

28:24.501 --> 28:28.167
Yeah, well, the way it is doesn’t work for me,

28:28.382 --> 28:30.103
and it doesn’t work for my friends.

28:30.283 --> 28:33.282
Yeah, I know. But that’s… that’s kind of why I came here.

28:35.238 --> 28:37.937
This thing could get really messy if someone doesn’t take the high road.

28:37.982 --> 28:43.097
And, I know this is not my place to ask, but I was just hoping that you could rise above it.

28:43.363 --> 28:44.900
I don’t think I can do that.

28:45.929 --> 28:48.698
Okay. Just know that if you do,

28:50.471 --> 28:52.041
the team’s gonna come around.

28:52.528 --> 28:54.603
Their gonna see that you’re a good guy and a hell of a player.

28:54.735 --> 28:55.755
And if I can’t?

28:56.733 --> 28:57.832
Then I got your back.

29:01.863 --> 29:04.561
- They trashed the court?
- Yep.

29:05.826 --> 29:06.742
What else?

29:07.417 --> 29:10.428
Broke into my locker, soaked my stuff.

29:11.954 --> 29:14.299
I don’t know, Hales, I don’t know how much longer I can put up with this.

29:15.692 --> 29:18.857
Do you think they’re gonna, like, let up anytime soon?

29:19.215 --> 29:22.117
- No chance. And you want to know why?
- Why?

29:22.148 --> 29:24.191
Because Nathan controls the team.

29:24.825 --> 29:26.576
And there’s no way in hell he’s gonna back off.

29:28.491 --> 29:29.429
What are you thinking?

29:30.048 --> 29:35.481
This weird thing happened at the tutoring center. It’s not important, nevermind.

29:35.860 --> 29:37.472
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Mm-Hmm.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.281
Are we still going to go to the movie tomorrow night?

29:39.935 --> 29:43.151
- Yeah. Sounds like fun.
- Okay, cool.

29:47.181 --> 29:49.458
Luke, how far do you think he’s really gonna go.

29:50.063 --> 29:52.193
- Nathan?
- I don’t know.

29:53.104 --> 29:55.445
As far as he wants to go until somebody stops him.

31:12.225 --> 31:12.972
Hey, Luke.

31:14.672 --> 31:16.387
Lets go, lets go! Get him in!

31:57.102 --> 32:00.147
Well, well. The gang’s all here.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.129
I told you it was gonna get worse.

32:05.083 --> 32:08.785
Now, see, normally this is when you become part of the team.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.022
We’d have a keg, tell some war stories…

32:13.275 --> 32:15.595
but you had to know that wasn’t going to happen, right?

32:16.285 --> 32:21.196
Look… these guys made a choice to back me.

32:22.195 --> 32:25.077
But we’re going to be nice, and we’re going to let you walk away.

32:26.363 --> 32:27.781
Just quit the team, man.

32:29.828 --> 32:31.297
Otherwise, it’s going to get ugly.

32:34.840 --> 32:36.867
- Let’s get out of here.
- Bye, Luke.

32:48.618 --> 32:49.960
Hey, where you been?

32:50.770 --> 32:51.542
Nowhere.

32:52.684 --> 32:55.741
Luke... What happened to you?

32:56.253 --> 32:58.163
I had a little run-in with the team.

33:00.175 --> 33:03.136
Luke, I’m sorry this is so hard for you.

33:03.918 --> 33:07.011
I wish there was a way that I could help, but I don’t think there is.

33:07.113 --> 33:08.039
There’s not.

33:08.203 --> 33:13.185
Well, if it makes you feel any better, I called some woman a bitch the other day.

33:16.339 --> 33:18.361
I’m proud of you. You know that?

33:19.341 --> 33:21.788
Sometimes I wonder where you get all your strength.

33:22.064 --> 33:24.936
- I get that from you.
- Oh, I don’t know about that.

33:25.684 --> 33:30.142
- I haven’t been on my best behavior lately.
- Well, they don’t make it easy, do they?

33:30.394 --> 33:35.796
No, they don’t. That doesn’t mean we have to sink to their level.

33:35.929 --> 33:37.629
Take the high road, huh?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.012
Yeah, sounds familiar.

33:42.764 --> 33:43.820
But, mom,

33:45.319 --> 33:46.845
I tried that.

33:47.824 --> 33:50.188
And I want to make you proud, I do.

33:51.965 --> 33:56.222
But there comes a certain point when you have to fight back.

34:00.152 --> 34:01.535
And I’m at that point.

34:13.371 --> 34:16.400
Ball! Ball! Ball! Over here! Ball!

34:22.407 --> 34:23.576
What the hell was that?

34:25.188 --> 34:29.342
- Here! Second team!
- But he stole the ball from his own team!

34:29.424 --> 34:34.389
But nothing! That guy has hit seven in a row and you won’t pass him to ball!

34:35.373 --> 34:38.681
And you! This is a team game.

34:41.947 --> 34:44.849
If you guys don’t get your heads out of your asses,

34:45.393 --> 34:49.510
I might be forced to suspend my second team this season.

34:49.719 --> 34:50.703
Go home!

34:53.273 --> 34:55.248
So much for the high road, huh?

35:12.861 --> 35:13.896
Hey!

35:14.649 --> 35:15.431
Hey.

35:16.124 --> 35:18.479
- I tried to call you about last night...
- No, it’s okay.

35:18.530 --> 35:21.350
You’re mom told me what happened. Are you all right? I was really worried about you.

35:21.398 --> 35:24.264
Yeah, I know, and I’m sorry.

35:24.899 --> 35:29.937
- Luke, I just want things to get better for you.
- Trust me, so do I.

35:32.241 --> 35:35.646
- They’re not going to, are they?
- Well, not without a fight.

35:37.648 --> 35:41.974
Hey. I’ll find a way to get past this. Don’t worry about it.

35:44.432 --> 35:47.684
You know what? I need to do something.

35:50.172 --> 35:52.917
I will see you tomorrow for Burning Boat, okay?

35:52.978 --> 35:54.196
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:56.173 --> 36:00.126
Uh, sorry. I’m sorry too.

36:00.419 --> 36:01.411
For what?

36:03.806 --> 36:04.779
I’ll see you tomorrow.

36:31.041 --> 36:32.601
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:33.161 --> 36:36.852
I looked over your English exam, and if you really want to learn, I can help you.

36:38.118 --> 36:40.385
That’s great. All right.

36:40.774 --> 36:46.190
I just… I have two conditions. One, Lucas does not find out, okay? Ever.

36:46.344 --> 36:47.251
All right, fine.

36:48.387 --> 36:51.674
And number two, you leave him alone.

36:53.718 --> 36:55.929
Well, I don’t really have much of a choice, do I?

36:58.075 --> 37:01.817
Okay, meet me tomorrow, 7AM at the Market Street dock.

37:02.190 --> 37:04.352
Well, what about the tutoring center?

37:04.684 --> 37:07.430
No way. The dock. Take it or leave it.

37:08.606 --> 37:10.665
Okay. 7:00 then.

37:13.134 --> 37:13.921
Okay.

37:25.590 --> 37:28.462
- Breakfast of champions. Want some?
- You’re late.

37:35.093 --> 37:36.971
Ugh, please let this be a cheat sheet.

37:43.157 --> 37:44.038
It’s for you.

37:45.287 --> 37:46.636
- Stop it.
- Come on.

37:50.299 --> 37:52.035
Don’t say I never gave you anything.

37:54.636 --> 37:58.021
Do you see this book? Because this book is me. I am math.

37:58.440 --> 38:01.276
- What’s that supposed to mean?
- It’s supposed to mean that you can work

38:01.323 --> 38:04.881
your whole "I’m Nathan Scott, Mr. Big shot, scoring my touchdowns" on somebody else,

38:04.953 --> 38:06.771
- because I don’t...
- I don’t even play football.

38:07.298 --> 38:10.580
Whatever. Look, the point is at the end of the day, all your bluster and BS

38:10.671 --> 38:13.867
don’t mean anything to math because math don’t care, and neither do I.

38:14.429 --> 38:18.179
Well, does English care? ‘Cause I really suck at that, too.

38:18.383 --> 38:19.791
Please don’t waste my time.

38:20.626 --> 38:23.959
I am already taking a huge chance on you because my instincts are screaming that you’re full of sh...

38:26.495 --> 38:28.854
Let’s just get started, okay?

38:32.669 --> 38:33.596
Page 81.

38:40.548 --> 38:41.208
Hey.

38:42.012 --> 38:46.016
This is who I am. This is how I am. And 95% of the time

38:46.114 --> 38:51.218
there isn’t a moral, or a victory, or a silver lining. Take it or leave it.

38:53.143 --> 38:54.449
And if we leave it?

38:55.484 --> 38:58.018
If you leave it then you’ll miss that other 5%.

38:58.791 --> 39:00.210
Your mistake.

39:04.429 --> 39:05.238
Good evening.

39:06.388 --> 39:10.553
Usually the master of ceremonies at this deal is Red Legner.

39:11.181 --> 39:17.683
But, well… Red died, so what are you gonna do?

39:19.994 --> 39:24.063
Now, every year we have a Burning Boat,

39:24.232 --> 39:28.513
and every year people find things to toss into it.

39:29.255 --> 39:32.478
I guess if everything was perfect, we wouldn’t be human.

39:34.409 --> 39:36.372
Time to let the past go.

39:42.363 --> 39:44.783
- Shari!
- Karen.

39:47.052 --> 39:52.147
I just wanted to introduce you to my son, Lucas. Lucas, this is Shari, Tim’s mother.

39:52.387 --> 39:53.341
Stepmother.

39:54.426 --> 39:55.629
Nice to meet you.

39:57.713 --> 40:00.468
- I’m gonna take off, okay?
- Okay.

40:01.124 --> 40:02.931
- You be careful.
- I will.

40:06.126 --> 40:09.432
Look, I’m sorry about what I said before.

40:10.460 --> 40:15.910
Because-let’s face it-it’s been a long time. We really don’t know each other anymore.

40:17.093 --> 40:20.047
But I want to give you the benefit of the doubt so that next time we meet,

40:20.558 --> 40:23.266
at least I’ll be dealing with the person you’ve become.

40:25.181 --> 40:27.199
And I hope you’ll do the same.

40:28.401 --> 40:34.146
I guess it’s not every day that we get a shot at starting over

40:34.183 --> 40:36.348
and putting our feet on the right path.

40:36.890 --> 40:40.835
That said, I guess we better get to the rat killing.

40:58.791 --> 41:00.203
Say "good bye" to cheerleading, mom.

41:08.662 --> 41:10.289
So, you my date tonight, Luke?

41:11.979 --> 41:14.534
You know, Brooke, you don’t have to act like this.

41:16.443 --> 41:19.256
I know that. But you’re the first guy to ever say it.

41:23.699 --> 41:26.315
You do your thing and try to resist.

41:27.089 --> 41:28.346
It’s actually kind of cute.

41:38.926 --> 41:40.177
You left that at the court.

41:41.911 --> 41:44.102
- I don’t know what you’re talking about.
- Then call it a gift.

41:44.722 --> 41:47.841
Besides, you’re gonna need it to paint over your scoring title in the gym,

41:48.327 --> 41:51.470
- 'cause I’m taking it.
- Yeah, in your dreams.

41:51.583 --> 41:52.802
I don’t care what you do to me.

41:53.242 --> 41:56.253
Whatever you got, you better bring it, ‘cause I’m not going anywhere.

42:00.322 --> 42:02.417
Burn these for me, would you?

42:05.085 --> 42:09.073
E.E. Cummings once wrote, "To be nobody but yourself,

42:09.722 --> 42:12.426
in a world which is doing its best, night and day,

42:12.826 --> 42:14.409
to make you everybody else…"

42:14.823 --> 42:15.458
Hey.

42:16.251 --> 42:16.769
Hey.

42:17.228 --> 42:21.418
"…means to fight the hardest battle, which any human being can fight…"

42:21.612 --> 42:22.498
Nice bracelet.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.245
"…and never stop fighting."

42:38.063 --> 42:41.401
Hey, it’s Jeff Nelson. I just wanted to let you know,

42:41.539 --> 42:43.776
we’re running your strip in the next issue.

42:50.223 --> 42:53.813
- Where were you this morning?
- Just tutoring.

42:54.155 --> 42:55.728
Oh, yeah? Anyone I know?

42:57.530 --> 42:58.512
No.

42:59.305 --> 43:05.164
