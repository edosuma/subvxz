Did anyone tell you Robert was gay?

00:55.430 --> 00:57.182
Yes. Robert did.

00:57.557 --> 01:01.770
I believe you, Sol, and a seafood tower
were there at the time.

01:01.853 --> 01:03.688
No, I mean, before you got married.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.107
Did anyone ever try to warn you?

01:06.191 --> 01:07.442
No. Why?

01:07.525 --> 01:09.069
Ah, I was just thinking

01:09.152 --> 01:12.322
about those three-quarter length pants
he used to wear.

01:12.405 --> 01:13.740
What would you call those?

01:13.823 --> 01:15.825
Shants

01:15.909 --> 01:17.744
-Clamdiggers.
-Right.

01:17.827 --> 01:19.913
Clamdiggers.

01:19.996 --> 01:20.872
Ironic.

01:20.955 --> 01:24.793
Frankie, much as I enjoy your strolls
down non-sequitur lane...

01:24.876 --> 01:26.377
They are pretty scenic.

01:26.461 --> 01:29.255
Would you please stop decomposing
over there and come and help me?

01:29.964 --> 01:31.549
Wish I could.

01:31.633 --> 01:35.178
But I'm in a vicious street brawl
with the universe at the moment.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.514
So's your hair.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.058
No, seriously.

01:40.725 --> 01:44.020
She's been sending me dreams and signs

01:44.103 --> 01:46.856
and near-death experiences
to get me to do something.

01:46.940 --> 01:48.566
But I really don't want to do it.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.819
I'll bite.
What is the universe telling you to do?

01:50.902 --> 01:54.155
Oh, I can't tell you.
By naming the thing, you give it power.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.283
It's a classic
Beetlejuice/Babadook situation.

01:57.367 --> 01:58.743
Are those your yogurt friends?

01:58.827 --> 02:01.162
I think you're thinking
of my friend, Barbaduke.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.957
-Hey, Miss Universe!

02:05.416 --> 02:07.460
Oh, my God, it's a sign...

02:07.544 --> 02:10.880
that we have to pack up these vibrators
for the pop-up at Arlene's.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.882
Okay, fine. I'll help.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.677
But what is Arlene doing
in an old folks' home, anyway?

02:15.760 --> 02:17.053
She's my age.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.138
Our age.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.722
Really?

02:19.806 --> 02:22.308
You come off as so much older.

02:24.310 --> 02:28.022
Walden Villas is not an old folks' home.
It's a "senior living community."

02:28.106 --> 02:30.400
-Same thing.
-Arlene is very happy there,

02:30.483 --> 02:32.402
so we have to keep an open mind.

02:32.485 --> 02:34.904
Not to mention,
it's gonna be a gold mine for us.

02:34.988 --> 02:37.240
Those places are hotbeds of sex,

02:37.323 --> 02:38.992
teeming with chlamydia.

02:39.075 --> 02:41.035
Hmm. You do make it sound fun.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.663
I know we haven't hit it off.

02:43.746 --> 02:46.666
And I'm sorry for saying
you were put together inside out.

02:48.668 --> 02:53.715
But I'm trying to do something nice
for your mom, so please don't hurt me.

02:59.387 --> 03:00.221
Showtime, folks.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.936
Have you noticed anything different
about Gregory tonight?

03:07.020 --> 03:09.522
Oh, is he drooling?
'Cause all his bibs are in the dryer.

03:09.606 --> 03:10.857
Uh...

03:10.940 --> 03:12.275
No.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.236
He just looks a little... shiny.

03:16.154 --> 03:20.200
You can't put a collar on Gregory!
He has contact dermatitis! Aw!

03:20.283 --> 03:21.117
I thought you had that.

03:23.870 --> 03:25.622
What... Oh! Okay.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.126
What are you doing down there?

03:33.796 --> 03:34.672
Holy shit.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.259
Is that a...

03:39.302 --> 03:40.929
Are... you...

03:41.763 --> 03:42.722
Allison...

03:43.640 --> 03:45.058
Alistair

03:45.141 --> 03:46.809
Giampietro-Smikowitz...

03:47.644 --> 03:48.811
will you...

03:49.687 --> 03:50.688
marry me?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
Oh...

03:52.273 --> 03:56.319
Nwabudike Douglas Bergstein...
it's beautiful.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.529
I mean, it's unsanitary from the floor,

03:58.613 --> 04:00.114
-but we can Purell it.
-We can Purell it.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.664
I still don't think we should get married
just 'cause we're having a baby.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.501
I keep telling you,
it's not just because of the baby.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.544
I've wanted to marry you for a long time.

04:14.003 --> 04:16.881
I got into a fight with Coyote
because of how serious I was about you.

04:16.965 --> 04:17.882
Months ago!

04:17.966 --> 04:19.676
You got into a fight with Coyote about me?

04:20.134 --> 04:21.261
Uh...

04:22.762 --> 04:25.014
No. I mean, it wasn't about you.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.892
It was about how much you love candy corn,
which he doesn't get,

04:27.976 --> 04:30.645
because why are there layers
if the layers don't taste different?

04:30.728 --> 04:32.897
-They do taste different.
-Exactly.

04:32.981 --> 04:35.775
But let's forget
about Coyote's unsophisticated palate.

04:35.858 --> 04:37.277
It's hard.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.112
What's the problem?

04:40.697 --> 04:41.906
I love you.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.658
You love me.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.536
We're both definitely
not scared of Gregory.

04:47.495 --> 04:49.414
Say yes.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.334
Okay.

04:53.918 --> 04:56.754
Is that "yes"?
I kind of need to hear you say "yes."

04:56.838 --> 04:58.548
Yes. It's a yes!

04:58.631 --> 04:59.465
Yes!

05:00.633 --> 05:03.052
Mmm. Mmm...

05:03.886 --> 05:05.305
Oh, my God. You said yes.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.181
This is so exciting!

05:07.265 --> 05:09.434
-I love you so much.
-I love you, too.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.520
There might just be one little thing...

05:15.189 --> 05:18.318
How come I never get to pick
where we do pop

05:18.401 --> 05:21.988
Because this is literally the first time
you've expressed any interest.

05:22.071 --> 05:25.950
Except, I've been in the vibrator business
for years now,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.661
and I think I've earned the right
to pick some pop-ups.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.371
All right. Okay. You can pick the next one.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.125
-Not sure.

05:34.208 --> 05:36.878
I know where the universe wants me to go.

05:37.920 --> 05:38.921
Oh, Jesus.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.299
Here, I thought we could put these
on the table.

05:41.382 --> 05:43.843
-I think they'll look nice.
-That's a great idea.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.971
So, how are things going
with this new guy you've been seeing?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.265
So far, pretty great.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.769
I mean, he's not who I would've thought
I'd be with, but, you know,

05:52.852 --> 05:54.812
-I'm having a hell of a time.
-Oh.

05:54.896 --> 05:57.231
He's surprising... in a good way.

05:57.315 --> 05:59.442
You deserve some good surprises.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.277
How about you? You seem really happy here.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.613
Oh, I am. It's great.

06:03.696 --> 06:08.326
You have laundry service, housekeeping,
they pick up your prescriptions...

06:08.409 --> 06:12.371
Wow. Imagine having someone
to do your laundry and run your errands.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.501
You have that person. Her name's me.

06:16.584 --> 06:20.129
By the by, we're out of dryer sheets,
the lavender ones.

06:20.213 --> 06:23.174
We wouldn't be out of them if you didn't
use them as deodorant.

06:23.257 --> 06:27.303
You know, it seems
this table stuff is going real well.

06:27.386 --> 06:29.847
So I'm gonna go make
some breakfast nachos.

06:29.931 --> 06:33.309
Arlene, I just need marshmallows,
chocolate, and your stove.

06:33.392 --> 06:35.353
Oh, they don't let us have those.

06:35.436 --> 06:36.854
Marshmallows?

06:36.938 --> 06:40.316
No, a stove. It's an insurance thing.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.402
Wait a minute. You don't have a stove?
But you love to cook.

06:43.486 --> 06:46.280
I do, but I also love not cleaning up.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.659
And they really encourage you
to eat in the dining hall.

06:49.742 --> 06:54.497
So, you eat all your meals at, like...
communal tables?

06:54.914 --> 06:57.250
Grace has weird boundary issues.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.335
Try talking to her when she's in the tub.

06:59.418 --> 07:04.674
I'll admit this whole thing has been
a bit of an adjustment for me, too.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.635
I mean, it was hard giving up my house,

07:07.718 --> 07:11.180
but it was so much to take care of
after Bob died.

07:11.264 --> 07:14.183
-He helped in other ways.

07:14.267 --> 07:17.061
Well, Scott was the one
that convinced me to move here.

07:17.145 --> 07:20.356
Oh. I didn't realize it was his idea.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.775
Hello, button, my old friend.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.694
Frankie, don't touch that!

07:25.069 --> 07:25.987
What is it?

07:26.070 --> 07:30.533
Oh, they have these on the walls,
in case somebody needs medical assistance.

07:30.616 --> 07:33.077
You don't really notice them
after a while.

07:33.161 --> 07:36.205
-Ah! That must be the early birds.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.458
You finish setting up the table

07:38.541 --> 07:41.836
and I will take them
for a slow walk down a long hall.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.506
God, poor Arlene.

07:45.590 --> 07:49.260
I know. To have that fun button
and never get to push it.

07:49.343 --> 07:53.639
No! Obviously her son dumped her here.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.767
Didn't you say to keep an open mind
about this place?

07:56.851 --> 07:59.645
That was when I thought
it was Arlene's choice to be here. I mean, clearly she wanted
to stay in her own house.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.359
Instead of helping her do that,
he's off gallivanting

08:05.443 --> 08:07.236
while she has to eat with strangers.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.364
I like eating with strangers.
That's how I met Barbaduke.

08:10.865 --> 08:16.204
All I know is Arlene does not belong
in a place that doesn't have a stove,

08:16.287 --> 08:19.415
but does have a blue button on the wall.

08:24.003 --> 08:25.421
You pressed one, didn't you?

08:25.838 --> 08:27.089
Oh, Grace.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.091
I've pressed at least three.

08:33.221 --> 08:36.307
I've got a real problem with you ladies
hustling in on my game.

08:36.390 --> 08:41.437
The only vibrator these gals need is me,
my Viagra, and my restless leg syndrome.

08:41.521 --> 08:44.273
Aren't you a funky little nightmare.

08:44.357 --> 08:47.443
Sir, the Ménage is not your foe.

08:48.110 --> 08:52.823
You know, think of men and vibrators
like cake and pie.

08:53.491 --> 08:54.951
Women like dessert.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.828
All right, I'll take three.

08:59.330 --> 09:03.167
Uh... Actually, make it four.
And leave the price tags on.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.379
Oh, this is so much fun.

09:06.462 --> 09:09.715
I haven't had a rush like this
since I sold Mary Kay.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.843
I haven't had a rush like this
since I sold Mary Jane.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.595
Oh!

09:15.346 --> 09:16.180
Teddie?

09:16.264 --> 09:19.433
You know what? You should
come with us to our next pop-up.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.978
-It'll do you good to get out of here.
-I don't know.

09:22.061 --> 09:24.981
Scott doesn't like me to leave
without giving him the heads-up.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.148
Well, why tell him?

09:26.691 --> 09:28.693
You don't need to ask permission.
You're a grown woman.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.444
Make your own decisions.

09:30.528 --> 09:32.280
-You're coming with us.

09:32.363 --> 09:34.824
All right. All right.
So where are we going?

09:34.907 --> 09:38.452
That is a good question.
My guess would be Geo Junction.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.833
Teddie?

09:44.750 --> 09:48.129
Oh, my God, isn't there someone else
you could be bothering right now?

09:48.212 --> 09:51.132
Yes, there is. There is.

09:51.549 --> 09:52.675
-Uh, Grand--
-Uh!

09:52.758 --> 09:56.470
Hush now. You've played your part,
gentle specter.

09:57.847 --> 09:59.682
Well-played, universe.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.351
Okay, you win.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.064
So Spit likes him?

10:07.148 --> 10:10.067
Mm... They've reached a détente.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.820
Hmm. And how is Barry liking the new job?

10:12.903 --> 10:15.114
Lauren's a monster like I said she was.

10:15.197 --> 10:18.409
She's taking everyone out to dinner
tonight to celebrate, like,

10:18.492 --> 10:20.786
a new product
or her period or something.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.539
I'm sorry, were we supposed
to take you out to dinner for that?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.250
-Yes.
Everyone doing okay

10:26.334 --> 10:28.836
Coyote, are you loving that Saint

10:30.338 --> 10:31.881
Yep. So much.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.634
-That's my boy. Loves his cheese.
-Yeah. Yeah.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.971
I fucking hate soft cheese.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.306
Why don't you tell him?

10:40.389 --> 10:43.225
It's been years and it's, like,
a thing between us now.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.769
I don't even know how it happened.

10:45.227 --> 10:48.689
He got me a silver cheese knife
for Hanukkah.

10:48.773 --> 10:49.774
I'm in too deep.

10:49.857 --> 10:51.525
What's with your family and cheese?

10:52.276 --> 10:55.029
Hey, Mallory,
I got that pimento loaf you love.

10:55.112 --> 10:56.822
Oh!

10:57.657 --> 10:59.408
Did you just put cheese in your pocket?

11:00.868 --> 11:03.704
Fingers crossed it's a murderer.

11:08.751 --> 11:09.627
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.463
Uh, I was just leaving this
for your, um...

11:12.546 --> 11:14.006
-Right.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.300
It was delivered to our house by mistake.

11:17.301 --> 11:18.761
Thank you. I'll take that.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.349
Well, that took a weird turn.

11:23.432 --> 11:24.558
It sure did.

11:25.685 --> 11:26.602
Robert...

11:27.978 --> 11:31.565
can you think of a reason
why Oliver would be mad at us?

11:31.649 --> 11:33.818
-No.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.319
Nothing comes to mind.

11:37.655 --> 11:39.490
Ooh, more drama. Oh, no, it's a guy selling magazines.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.662
Come on, Bri. Just... Come on.

11:47.164 --> 11:50.251
Buddy! What a pleasant surprise.

11:50.334 --> 11:51.710
Come, please join us.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.171
What's going on here
and why wasn't I invited? It's a girls' and dads' dinner.

11:56.715 --> 11:58.717
Oh. Well, then why is Coyote here?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.261
Want to field that one, Mal?

12:00.678 --> 12:02.638
I was driving away and I saw his tiny face

12:02.721 --> 12:04.849
pressed up against the window
of his tiny house.

12:04.932 --> 12:06.475
I'll set another place.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.227
No, no, no. I don't want to interrupt--

12:08.310 --> 12:11.188
What are you talking about?
You're not interrupting.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.399
You know, sometimes interruptions
are wonderful.

12:13.482 --> 12:15.276
If temporary.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.360
Everything okay?

12:16.444 --> 12:19.697
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you and Robert
about something privately.

12:19.780 --> 12:22.533
-We're listening.
-No, you know, it's fine. I'll just--

12:22.616 --> 12:24.118
Oh, God, is it the baby?

12:24.201 --> 12:26.454
No, no, no, no. The baby's fine.
Baby's fine.

12:26.537 --> 12:30.124
Did they stop making Dockers?
Who do we call

12:30.207 --> 12:31.375
Bud, what happened?

12:33.043 --> 12:35.171
I proposed to Allison, and she said yes.

12:35.254 --> 12:36.505
Oh, mazel tov!

12:36.589 --> 12:37.631
Yay! Oh!

12:37.715 --> 12:40.301
Good. This will take your mind off
the Dockers shortage.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.886
I'll get the champagne.

12:41.969 --> 12:44.972
-Well, maybe hold off on the champagne.

12:45.806 --> 12:49.727
She won't marry me without a prenup,
and I told her I won't get a prenup.

12:49.810 --> 12:50.769
Oh.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.229
Oh, that's bad.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.149
Fun!

12:57.735 --> 13:00.863
Yes, I understand the concept
of "no backsies." I just asked why you suddenly decided
we should go to a college.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.869
It's not exactly our customer base.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.788
You know darn well what happened
last time I didn't listen to the universe

13:09.872 --> 13:11.790
when she was so persistent.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.542
My yurt exploded.

13:14.210 --> 13:16.712
What do you have to do
to make a yurt explode?

13:16.795 --> 13:18.464
Did you see<i> Bad Boys II?</i>

13:18.547 --> 13:20.382
I am not compelled by the universe.

13:20.466 --> 13:23.802
So I need a normal,
human reason for this pop-up.

13:23.886 --> 13:28.015
Well, like retirement places,
colleges are hotbeds of sex.

13:28.098 --> 13:32.436
You think old people have sexual diseases.
College invented chlamydia.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.939
I think it's a great idea.

13:35.022 --> 13:38.317
You have all those
older female professors.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.445
Students are always getting hurt
playing sports.

13:41.529 --> 13:44.156
Playing Frisbee and Rubik's Cubing,

13:44.240 --> 13:46.367
they will love the Ménage.

13:46.450 --> 13:50.287
And, if we can hook them while
they're young, we will have them for life.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.581
Like cigarette companies and<i> Degrassi.</i>

13:52.665 --> 13:54.500
You actually make a good argument.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.669
I do some of my best work when I bullshit.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.254
-Oh, God.

14:00.214 --> 14:03.008
So how are things going
with that new guy you're seeing?

14:04.552 --> 14:05.928
Arlene, you already asked me that.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.680
I did?
-Yes.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.557
Oh, of course.

14:09.640 --> 14:13.519
I'm sorry, just one of those embarrassing
senior moments.

14:13.602 --> 14:15.854
Oh, please, we all get them.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.231
Speak for yourself.

14:17.314 --> 14:19.400
I'm still sharp as a tack.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.652
Is that a word, tack?

14:21.735 --> 14:25.906
Ah, just one of the joys of getting older,
I guess.

14:26.907 --> 14:31.537
You know, I read somewhere
that the antidote for those senior moments

14:31.620 --> 14:34.498
is challenging yourself
with new experiences.

14:34.582 --> 14:37.251
I also read it helps
if you get a helper monkey.

14:37.334 --> 14:41.297
For the last time,
we are not getting a helper monkey.

14:41.380 --> 14:44.091
Okay, Grace.
We'll get a monkey that doesn't help us.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.553
Well, I am always trying to learn
new things.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.555
Right now, I'm learning to play canasta.

14:49.638 --> 14:53.267
Well, see, I meant,
getting out in the world,

14:53.350 --> 14:55.728
remembering that we're vibrant,
independent women.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.396
A little help here?

14:57.479 --> 15:01.066
I seem to have triple-buckled myself
into my necklace.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.819
Get me a damn monkey, Grace!

15:05.571 --> 15:07.406
I can't believe she wants a prenup.

15:07.489 --> 15:10.367
Lots of people want them.
That was a big part of our business.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.454
I can't believe you didn't tell us
that you bagged a secret heiress.

15:13.537 --> 15:14.622
Nicely done.

15:14.705 --> 15:16.457
-She's not an heiress.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.751
Because that would have cleared up
a lot of questions.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.879
She wants a prenup
because I'm a divorce lawyer.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.381
If we broke up,
she thinks I'd be at a huge advantage.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.634
So she wants to protect herself
and the baby.

15:26.717 --> 15:29.178
-That is a fair point.
-Well, yeah, I get it,

15:29.261 --> 15:32.431
but I don't want to start our marriage
assuming that it won't work out

15:32.514 --> 15:35.142
-and things'll get ugly.
-It doesn't have to mean that.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.978
Is it that big a deal?
You usually give her whatever she wants.

15:38.062 --> 15:41.023
No. No prenup. Brianna wants a boat.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.775
Agh, just don't get married.

15:42.858 --> 15:46.195
Love fades, people change.
Then they do fine, and you're miserable.

15:46.278 --> 15:48.197
That's a little dark, sweetheart.

15:48.280 --> 15:49.990
Just speaking my truth.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.242
I like you like this, all goth and surly.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.995
-Fuck off.
-It's adorable.

15:55.454 --> 15:58.999
You know, your father and I talked about
a prenup when we were getting married

15:59.083 --> 16:01.794
and we decided against it,
but it took a lot of talking.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.546
I think you just need to be honest
with Allison.

16:04.630 --> 16:06.882
Like you should be honest
about what happened with Oliver?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.510
I told you, nothing happened with Oliver.

16:09.593 --> 16:12.179
And yet, all evidence
points to the contrary.

16:12.262 --> 16:14.556
Can we talk about this later, please?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.433
Your son has come to us for advice

16:16.517 --> 16:18.894
and we should be
laser-focused on him right now.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.397
I am, but I have a number of lasers

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
and they can point
in different directions.

16:23.190 --> 16:25.609
-Let's not do this here and now.
-Fine.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.319
I'll be in the study.

16:27.403 --> 16:29.446
I'll meet you there in one minute.

16:29.530 --> 16:30.572
We'll be right back.

16:33.242 --> 16:38.455
Fifty-eight, fifty-seven,
fifty-six, fifty-five. Oh, jeez.

16:41.750 --> 16:42.835
So glad I came over.

16:42.918 --> 16:44.420
Just to recap, you weren't invited.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.432
Brianna, could you shut the door?

16:56.515 --> 16:57.850
Of course.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.229
I think he meant
with you on the other side.

17:02.312 --> 17:05.941
No. Please don't make me go back out there
and talk about marriage and babies.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.736
Barry makes me talk about heart feels now.
Can't I just...

17:08.819 --> 17:11.071
stay in here where it's nice and angry?

17:12.031 --> 17:15.451
Fine, but this conversation
is also about marriage.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.745
About a marriage I suspect
your father jeopardized.

17:17.828 --> 17:19.872
I didn't jeopardize anything.

17:19.955 --> 17:21.206
Then why is Oliver mad?

17:21.290 --> 17:24.376
If not because you talked to Jo
after you promised me you wouldn't?

17:24.460 --> 17:28.172
I did not talk to Jo. Oliver came over
and said something gay about an orchid.

17:28.255 --> 17:31.091
Then he started asking about our marriage
and it just came out.

17:31.175 --> 17:32.301
You went back on your word.

17:32.384 --> 17:33.802
No, no, I called an audible.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.389
-Football reference.
-I thought hockey, but thank you.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.059
And if you'd have been there,
you'd have done the same thing.

17:40.142 --> 17:44.605
I don't know which is worse: the fact
that you went against what we agreed on,

17:44.688 --> 17:49.401
or that you don't seem to care that you
hurt Oliver and his lovely bride-to-be.

17:49.485 --> 17:51.570
-Thank you.

17:51.653 --> 17:54.531
-Thank you.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.534
You might be mad that I did it,
but I know I did the right thing.

17:57.618 --> 18:00.120
Did you? Because now Oliver hates us.

18:00.204 --> 18:03.665
Good luck getting an invite
to their<i> Designing Women</i> party now.

18:03.749 --> 18:07.419
I'm sorry, who are these people? There's
an orchid and a<i> Designing Women</i> party,

18:09.463 --> 18:12.257
And isn't Oliver mad at us
like a gay man would be?

18:12.341 --> 18:17.638
I mean, dramatically dropping the package
down and then stomping off in a huff.

18:17.721 --> 18:20.891
He was just taking his leave
like a strong Sugarbaker woman.

18:22.684 --> 18:25.020
You can make light of this
if you want to, Robert.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.689
But I really liked Oliver.
That's why I brought him over.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.483
Because I thought for once,

18:29.566 --> 18:32.611
I could be the one
bringing a new friend into our lives.

18:33.112 --> 18:38.117
But evidently you have enough friends
on your own, so...

18:39.451 --> 18:41.995
easy come, easy go with mine.

18:52.005 --> 18:53.257
Enjoy.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.884
I have to hand it to you,
this was a genius idea.

18:56.593 --> 18:59.054
I forgot how much Millennials
love waiting in line.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.640
Hey, since I'm such a super genius,

19:01.723 --> 19:03.684
I've earned myself a little break, right?

19:04.309 --> 19:05.144
How little?

19:05.227 --> 19:08.605
Somewhere between what you think is
appropriate and what I'm going to do?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.693
Nice try. Hand me another box of Ménages.

19:20.159 --> 19:23.078
Or you could just disappear
in a poof of patchouli.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.079
Enjoy.

19:31.086 --> 19:32.880
-Thank you.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.716
Your dad's really mad.
And not in his usual Muppet way.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.763
I think all the marriage
and divorce talk really bummed her out.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.975
-You know, I'm gonna go talk to her.
No, no, let me.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.310
I'm the one who brought it up.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.740
Hey, am I pulling these off?

19:59.823 --> 20:01.617
Nadia said I'd look good in a boot cut.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.620
-Yeah, I think I'm gonna go.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.541
Enjoy.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.753
Excuse me, ma'am? Are you a professor
or a member of the staff here?

20:12.836 --> 20:14.588
What does it look like?

20:14.671 --> 20:16.632
Like a strange woman handing out dildos.

20:16.715 --> 20:19.009
Excuse me, these are vibrators.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.554
Oh, well, in that case,
you and your vibrators have to go.

20:22.638 --> 20:24.973
But we are empowering young women.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.808
-Yeah!

20:27.809 --> 20:29.895
Unless you have an empowerment permit,

20:29.978 --> 20:33.482
which doesn't exist, I'm going to have
to insist that you leave. Now.

20:34.816 --> 20:35.734
All right, folks.

20:35.817 --> 20:39.321
Please go to class or whatever it is
you do on your parents' dime.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.405
No, wait! Don't go!

20:40.489 --> 20:43.742
Grace, I've had enough new experiences
for one day.

20:43.825 --> 20:45.327
Can we just go home?

20:46.620 --> 20:47.829
Of course.

20:48.622 --> 20:51.625
All right, we're leaving.
Look us up on the web!

20:54.962 --> 20:59.174
Frankie, I don't know where you went
on your little break, comma,

20:59.258 --> 21:01.176
but we're being kicked off campus, period.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.844
I'll see you at home, period.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.597
If there is a monkey there,
I'm gonna train it to strangle you

21:05.681 --> 21:08.892
and no jury will convict me,
exclamation point.

21:11.520 --> 21:16.108
But he felt production isn't necessarily
a sign of economic health.

21:16.191 --> 21:17.943
I have a little side note.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.945
I hung out with Galbraith at Harvard

21:20.028 --> 21:22.489
and he was a hell of a guy
to grab a beer with.

21:25.200 --> 21:29.079
Excuse me, did somebody forget my rule
about no phones in my seminars?

21:42.884 --> 21:45.304
Sorry I ruined girls' night.

21:45.387 --> 21:49.308
It's okay. It was doomed
when I had to eat the pimento loaf.

21:49.391 --> 21:52.477
Hey, you're lucky.
I'm "Mr. Stuffed-Grape-Leaves."

21:54.396 --> 21:55.647
To be honest...

21:56.231 --> 21:57.899
I was in a shit mood even before that.

21:59.401 --> 22:03.780
Last night, I finally decided
to stop moping around the house.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.283
So I hired a sitter

22:06.366 --> 22:08.452
and I went to the movies.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.287
Alone.

22:10.871 --> 22:13.165
And I ran into Mitch.

22:13.248 --> 22:14.374
Oh, boy.

22:14.458 --> 22:16.752
-Coming out of a fancy restaurant.
-Oh, shit.

22:16.835 --> 22:21.381
With some woman who he may
have been holding hands with.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.549
Fuck.

22:22.632 --> 22:23.592
Yeah.

22:23.675 --> 22:27.179
So that might explain why I was...

22:28.055 --> 22:30.223
a little negative
about the whole marriage thing.

22:31.266 --> 22:34.686
"A little negative"? You were like
John Wick after they killed his puppy.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.146
I'm sorry.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.357
I'm also sorry
you just ruined<i> John Wick</i> for me.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.235
Excuse you, it came out two years ago.
There's a sequel.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.363
Well, I've been a little busy
having my whole life fall apart.

22:50.702 --> 22:51.703
You know...

22:52.621 --> 22:54.706
I get where Allison's coming from.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.335
Divorce is so awful.

22:59.878 --> 23:01.755
Why not give yourself a safety net?

23:02.214 --> 23:04.925
The only problem is,
if you do get divorced,

23:05.008 --> 23:08.678
it undoes everything you believe and...

23:09.721 --> 23:11.723
your heart will be broken.

23:12.849 --> 23:13.975
And nothing...

23:15.060 --> 23:16.895
certainly not a piece of paper,

23:16.978 --> 23:18.814
is going to protect you from that.

23:21.066 --> 23:25.028
Are you sure Frankie's okay?
She never texted you back.

23:25.112 --> 23:27.989
Don't worry. It's her MO.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.827
Radio silence if she's mad
or she knows she's in trouble.

23:32.869 --> 23:37.499
I didn't hear from her for a whole day
after she set off fireworks in the pantry.

23:38.708 --> 23:41.628
Oh, she is one-of-a-kind.

23:41.711 --> 23:42.754
Yeah.

23:44.256 --> 23:47.134
So, how are things going
with that new guy you're seeing?

23:51.805 --> 23:53.348
You already asked me that, honey.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.308
I did?

23:55.851 --> 23:57.769
Oh, I'm sorry.

23:58.186 --> 23:59.312
It's okay.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.941
Wait, where are you going?

24:03.024 --> 24:05.110
You have to make a right on Escondido.

24:05.193 --> 24:07.737
This isn't the way to my house.

24:07.821 --> 24:10.282
Arlene, you don't live
in that house anymore.

24:11.283 --> 24:12.159
-No.

24:12.242 --> 24:15.120
You moved to Walden Villas
a few months ago.

24:17.706 --> 24:18.707
Oh.

24:20.041 --> 24:21.168
Okay.

24:25.463 --> 24:26.548
Don't worry.

24:39.477 --> 24:41.563
Hey. Were you asleep?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.440
Conflict makes me a little sleepy.

24:45.108 --> 24:46.693
I'm sorry we argued.

24:48.737 --> 24:49.946
Me, too.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.996
I did do some thinking about the prenup.

24:58.079 --> 25:00.040
And I think you're right.

25:00.123 --> 25:02.792
You deserve to go into this marriage
with some security.

25:02.876 --> 25:07.172
So... I drew up
a preliminary agreement for us.

25:10.383 --> 25:13.803
"In the event of a divorce,
Allison Alistair Giampietro-Smikowitz

25:13.887 --> 25:19.100
can have anything she wants
from Nwabudike Douglas Bergstein."

25:20.101 --> 25:21.561
I don't understand.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.563
I'm worried you might be a bad lawyer.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.316
I'm actually a pretty good lawyer.

25:26.399 --> 25:29.152
I've handled a lot of divorces.
And my parents are divorced.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.029
And Mal's getting divorced.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.490
But despite all that,

25:33.573 --> 25:36.534
or, I don't know, maybe because of it, I want to start our life together
with a leap of faith.

25:40.288 --> 25:41.873
With my whole heart.

25:42.457 --> 25:45.335
So, you can have
whatever you need to feel secure.

25:46.002 --> 25:46.962
All I want is you.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.924
Oh, Bud, that is so sweet.

25:51.007 --> 25:52.550
All I want is you, too.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.762
And I want to take
that leap of faith with you.

26:04.437 --> 26:07.565
Oh, fuck! Gregory can't eat paper!
And I can't bend over.

26:07.649 --> 26:10.485
I need you to reach in
and pull it out of his throat!

26:14.990 --> 26:15.824
Thank God!

26:16.825 --> 26:18.868
-Scott.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.496
You weren't signed out,
and I've been calling for hours.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.206
-I'm fi...

26:23.290 --> 26:25.917
-Well, I think your mom got a little...
-Tired.

26:26.001 --> 26:29.671
It's been a long day.
Oh, I'm sorry you were worried, honey.

26:29.754 --> 26:33.591
Grace and I went out for a bit,
and I must have forgotten my phone.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.177
Sure you're all right?
You don't want to see one of the nurses?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.430
I'm fine.

26:38.513 --> 26:41.391
Let us say goodbye,
I'll freshen up a little,

26:41.474 --> 26:43.560
and then we'll go to the dining hall
and have dinner.

26:46.813 --> 26:51.151
I did have a lot of fun
with you guys today.

26:51.234 --> 26:52.652
-Yeah. Me, too.
-Oh...

26:54.654 --> 26:57.407
Maybe we could do it again sometime?

26:57.907 --> 26:59.326
-I'd love to.
-Okay.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.622
Um...

27:04.664 --> 27:05.790
Scott,

27:05.874 --> 27:08.585
I know it's not my business...

27:09.252 --> 27:12.297
but what's going on with your mother?

27:13.214 --> 27:15.216
Oh, she's fine most of the time.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.888
There were a few incidents
when she was living alone.

27:19.971 --> 27:21.389
Things left to burn on the stove,

27:21.473 --> 27:23.266
forgetting how to turn off
the alarm system.

27:23.725 --> 27:25.935
That's why we convinced her to move here.

27:26.019 --> 27:29.731
They have different levels of care
in case things get worse.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.692
I'm so sorry.

27:32.776 --> 27:34.986
-I had no idea.
-Mom's pretty proud.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.655
I'm sure she doesn't want you
to see her any differently.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.158
Yeah... I get that.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.203
Well, I'd better get going.

27:43.286 --> 27:44.412
Have a nice dinner.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.083
Oh, wait.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.418
Do you need me to get someone
to give you a ride home?

27:51.544 --> 27:52.754
No, thanks.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.006
I can still drive myself.

27:58.760 --> 28:01.429
Well, we'll talk about an extension later.

28:01.513 --> 28:04.891
It seems my sister,
who I haven't seen for 40 years,

28:04.974 --> 28:07.894
has taken a sudden interest
in economic theory.

28:10.730 --> 28:11.689
Hi, Teddie.

28:11.773 --> 28:14.776
Hi, Frankie. It's been a while. Who died?

28:14.859 --> 28:19.364
Me. Not physically,
but bureaucratically and emotionally.

28:19.447 --> 28:23.660
Well, I see the years
haven't dimmed your gift for hyperbole.

28:23.743 --> 28:27.163
No, in fact,
they've strengthened my gifts.

28:27.247 --> 28:28.790
I kind of feel like a Highlander.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.625
What are you doing here?

28:30.708 --> 28:33.253
I've been thinking a lot
about what if I did die.

28:33.753 --> 28:34.921
What would I regret?

28:35.004 --> 28:38.091
And my biggest regret
is what happened between us.

28:38.550 --> 28:41.761
I want to fix this...
before it's too late.

28:44.431 --> 28:46.975
You were right about Sol being gay.

28:50.270 --> 28:53.773
I still can't believe you told me
just before my wedding,

28:54.274 --> 28:56.609
but you were right about him.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.695
I'm sorry I was right.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.699
That's it

29:04.159 --> 29:06.786
I haven't heard from you in four decades.

29:06.870 --> 29:09.914
-I don't know.

29:09.998 --> 29:13.376
But I've had the universe up my ass
to come see you

29:13.460 --> 29:16.504
and, turns out,
you can't not listen to the universe.

29:16.588 --> 29:17.672
Can't you?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.425
Can we please just talk to each other?

29:20.508 --> 29:21.926
We just did. It made no sense,

29:23.511 --> 29:26.347
and I have a departmental meeting
in seven minutes.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.224
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

29:28.308 --> 29:29.559
That's fine.

29:29.642 --> 29:31.728
My meeting's in another building.

29:34.814 --> 29:37.233
Oh, that's great, Teddie.
But I'm not giving up.

29:37.317 --> 29:39.110
We're gonna make our peace, lady.

29:39.194 --> 29:42.906
You hear me? We're gonna make peace!

29:44.783 --> 29:47.410
Real mature, Teddie! Real mature.

29:50.038 --> 29:52.123
What do I do now, universe?
