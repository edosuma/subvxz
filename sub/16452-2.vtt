00:32.180 --> 00:33.303
Stay in bed.

00:44.156 --> 00:45.758
You've been so sweet lately.

00:49.662 --> 00:50.695
How's the coffee?

00:50.730 --> 00:52.000
Oh, it's very good.

00:52.069 --> 00:53.074
Thank you.

00:54.402 --> 00:55.904
Oh, you know, I meant to tell you...

00:55.950 --> 00:57.402
Your dad called the other day.

00:59.195 --> 01:00.200
Really?

01:00.628 --> 01:02.172
What did his message say?

01:02.357 --> 01:03.381
Well...

01:04.367 --> 01:05.429
It didn't...

01:06.018 --> 01:08.086
quite get to the answering machine.

01:09.829 --> 01:10.834
What do you mean?

01:11.389 --> 01:13.528
I accidentally picked up your phone.

01:16.369 --> 01:18.991
How many different ways do
you want me to say I am sorry?

01:19.083 --> 01:20.434
I don't want you to be sorry.

01:20.483 --> 01:22.028
I want you to have not picked up

01:22.074 --> 01:23.662
the phone when my father called.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.099
What do you expect?
Our phones look exactly alike.

01:26.215 --> 01:28.040
And you never put the receivers

01:28.097 --> 01:29.934
back on the correct charger.

01:30.419 --> 01:32.025
What exactly did my father say?

01:32.060 --> 01:33.552
All he said was,
"Is Brenda there?"

01:33.596 --> 01:35.883
and did he seem confused or...
or angry?

01:35.941 --> 01:37.672
I don't know what he seemed
like, Brenda,

01:37.731 --> 01:40.861
since I've never met or spoken
to your father before.

01:44.351 --> 01:46.083
Did you do this on purpose?

01:46.118 --> 01:47.712
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That's right.

01:47.735 --> 01:49.571
I did this all on purpose, Brenda.

01:49.652 --> 01:51.696
This is all part of my master

01:51.742 --> 01:53.669
plan to get your dad to hate me.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.055
Look, it was an accident.

01:55.533 --> 01:57.307
There are no accidents.

02:00.194 --> 02:01.846
Hello? Hello?

02:06.109 --> 02:07.198
Hello?

02:07.787 --> 02:08.919
Yes, Sergeant.

02:23.534 --> 02:24.767
Here she comes.

02:25.784 --> 02:26.881
No pressure.

02:32.727 --> 02:34.967
The construction company
started digging

02:35.025 --> 02:37.150
around 8:00 a.m. this morning

02:37.254 --> 02:39.622
A bulldozer uncovered a blue tarp

02:39.656 --> 02:42.036
with a body wrapped in it.

02:42.097 --> 02:45.120
The coroner's investigator
removed a wallet

02:45.201 --> 02:46.656
from the back pocket.

02:46.848 --> 02:48.342
The I.D. says...

02:48.393 --> 02:49.416
Darrell Richards.

02:50.635 --> 02:52.688
New shoes! New shoes!

02:53.497 --> 02:55.368
Any idea how long he's been dead?

02:55.449 --> 02:59.295
The investigator said and I quote...
"A long time."

02:59.584 --> 03:02.757
He won't even say for sure if
we have a homicide on our hands.

03:02.803 --> 03:04.935
Well, how are we supposed
to be watching our budget

03:04.958 --> 03:07.797
if we keep rolling out to crime scenes
that may not be crime scenes?

03:07.831 --> 03:10.369
Chief Pope took care of that.
He was gonna explain it to you.

03:10.404 --> 03:11.436
He hasn't.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.457
That doesn't make this our
problem anyway.

03:13.503 --> 03:16.194
77th division handles body
dumps, not us.

03:16.252 --> 03:17.303
Wait. Chief.

03:17.774 --> 03:18.801
- Hello?
- Chief.

03:18.847 --> 03:20.060
- Chief Pope, please.
- Chief!

03:20.106 --> 03:21.689
They found Provenza's business card

03:21.746 --> 03:23.433
in the dead guy's pocket.

03:28.519 --> 03:30.991
For heaven's sakes.
Let's go.

03:31.811 --> 03:32.919
Thank you.

03:34.883 --> 03:37.267
Well, Lieutenant,

03:37.336 --> 03:39.068
does the face ring a bell?

03:39.750 --> 03:41.009
Lost a little weight.

03:41.055 --> 03:43.076
The tarp preserved him.
He's basically a mummy.

03:43.180 --> 03:45.802
Looks to me like we got
a cheap funeral on our hands.

03:45.848 --> 03:47.344
no visible signs of anything,

03:47.395 --> 03:49.037
except a relationship

03:49.083 --> 03:50.134
with Provenza.

03:50.180 --> 03:51.474
This is an old card, Chief.

03:51.532 --> 03:53.610
I haven't had that number
in years.

03:56.117 --> 03:58.993
This driver's license expires in 1995.

04:00.194 --> 04:02.493
Body must have been buried
before that.

04:04.271 --> 04:06.602
Those belts have been popular
with gang members

04:06.650 --> 04:07.887
for a long time.

04:08.418 --> 04:09.516
82nd street.

04:10.567 --> 04:12.172
Were you an eight-deuce?

04:12.311 --> 04:14.216
This is eight-deuce territory.

04:16.197 --> 04:18.576
Buzz, would you start documenting
the scene, please?

04:18.611 --> 04:19.692
Yes, ma'am.

04:19.726 --> 04:20.666
All right, then.

04:20.759 --> 04:23.011
Where did that paint-spattered
tarp come from?

04:23.069 --> 04:24.848
Is our victim named Darrell Richards?

04:24.882 --> 04:26.228
And was he reported missing?

04:26.309 --> 04:28.457
And, Lieutenant?

04:29.208 --> 04:31.980
Why did he have your business
card in his pocket?

04:46.010 --> 04:48.587
You know what would really
help me remember?

04:49.199 --> 04:51.336
If you stared at me some more.

04:51.659 --> 04:54.188
I found a missing-persons report

04:54.304 --> 04:55.898
for a Darrell Richards,

04:55.955 --> 04:58.457
dated may 6, 1992.

04:58.480 --> 05:00.802
That was a busy time.
why?

05:00.871 --> 05:03.782
The L.A. riots.
They started april 29, 1992.

05:03.851 --> 05:05.445
Darrell was reported missing

05:05.514 --> 05:07.680
seven days later, towards the end.

05:09.973 --> 05:11.694
Can you confirm his identity

05:11.752 --> 05:12.999
from these x-rays, Dr. Crippen?

05:13.057 --> 05:15.816
Officially, not until the forensic
dentist signs off.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.579
But these look like the same
teeth to me.

05:18.660 --> 05:20.531
Now, unofficially, I'd say

05:20.577 --> 05:23.407
This is Darrell Richards...
99.9% sure.

05:23.452 --> 05:26.628
Well, I can't notify the family
until we're 100%.

05:26.698 --> 05:28.765
Can you at least narrow down
the time of death?

05:28.846 --> 05:30.867
Well, when does that report
say he went missing?

05:30.948 --> 05:32.053
1992.

05:32.334 --> 05:34.378
Well, then I'd say 1992.

05:35.294 --> 05:36.345
- But...
- But what?

05:36.403 --> 05:38.828
You haven't told us anything
we don't already know.

05:38.898 --> 05:40.595
Can you give us a cause of
death or not?

05:40.653 --> 05:43.471
It is nearly impossible to see
an entry wound

05:43.517 --> 05:45.458
given the shrinkage of the skin.

05:45.577 --> 05:46.394
But...

05:46.751 --> 05:48.759
I'd say that a bullet...

05:51.390 --> 05:52.982
...entered the side,

05:53.075 --> 05:54.678
continued straight through the heart.

05:54.725 --> 05:55.966
The heart is no longer there,

05:56.012 --> 05:57.310
but the bullet...

05:59.202 --> 05:59.860
is.

06:00.771 --> 06:01.556
Great.

06:04.037 --> 06:04.810
So...

06:06.370 --> 06:07.582
Maybe the...

06:07.859 --> 06:11.516
maybe the guy was firing at someone
and got hit underneath?

06:11.736 --> 06:13.374
That high in the armpit?

06:14.470 --> 06:15.901
At a downward angle?

06:16.070 --> 06:18.205
Injury wounds like that are
usually at close range,

06:18.239 --> 06:20.568
maybe like he was struggling
with someone.

06:20.614 --> 06:22.864
So, unless this is the strangest

06:22.921 --> 06:24.110
suicide I've ever seen,

06:24.171 --> 06:26.210
I'd say we have our cause of death.

06:26.798 --> 06:29.281
So the kid I gave my card to
was murdered.

06:31.738 --> 06:32.569
Great.

06:37.795 --> 06:40.359
Every gun creates a signature

06:40.440 --> 06:41.894
on the bullet it has fired...

06:41.895 --> 06:45.223
A signature as individual as the men who
signed the Declaration of Independence,

06:45.257 --> 06:46.803
which gave us the right to bear arms.

06:46.838 --> 06:47.981
Actually, that was the Bill of Rights,

06:48.027 --> 06:50.247
and it didn't include the right to
murder each other.

06:50.311 --> 06:51.610
Back in the dizz-ay,

06:51.679 --> 06:54.102
before "casings" became the thing,

06:54.171 --> 06:56.733
we were gonna create a
database for ammunition...

06:56.790 --> 06:57.713
Brian.

06:57.794 --> 07:00.910
Did you find a gun to match our
bullet or not?

07:04.442 --> 07:06.300
I'm sorry. Brian's kind of a geek.

07:06.369 --> 07:07.304
Really?

07:08.838 --> 07:10.304
Take a look at these.

07:11.341 --> 07:14.208
Now, all gun barrels have
grooves on the inside.

07:14.242 --> 07:15.015
Right.

07:15.258 --> 07:16.619
When the gun is fired, the

07:16.677 --> 07:19.146
grooves put marks on the bullet.

07:19.204 --> 07:22.365
Anyway, I checked all the specs
from your bullet

07:22.423 --> 07:23.731
in the catalog,

07:23.777 --> 07:26.765
and I came up with a colt diamondback.

07:27.342 --> 07:29.212
I- i looked up all the revolvers

07:29.292 --> 07:32.615
booked two weeks before
Darrell Richards

07:32.650 --> 07:34.513
was actually reported missing.

07:34.593 --> 07:38.609
Now, it's gonna take me a couple
of days for a full comparison,

07:38.863 --> 07:42.890
so if you can help me
narrow it down...

07:44.447 --> 07:45.440
Thank you.

07:46.166 --> 07:47.470
Hey, Provenza

07:47.840 --> 07:49.790
I got something for you
to put in your coffee.

07:49.847 --> 07:51.497
It's ginkgo-biloba extract.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.766
It's good for your memory.

07:52.813 --> 07:55.110
I'm not losing
my memory, okay?

07:55.156 --> 07:57.395
This kid went missing in 1992.

07:57.464 --> 07:59.426
That's like three wives ago.

07:59.506 --> 08:00.891
Well, will you remember to take it?

08:01.844 --> 08:04.290
Lieutenant Flynn, please leave
Lieutenant Provenza alone,

08:04.325 --> 08:06.275
and tell me what you found
out about that tarp.

08:07.740 --> 08:09.794
Let me see.
Dawkins Industries...

08:09.852 --> 08:13.597
Sold and produced over 300,000
of them in 1992.

08:13.719 --> 08:16.182
To find the person who bought
this one is not gonna happen,

08:16.245 --> 08:17.682
so I'm looking into the paint.

08:17.740 --> 08:20.440
I checked into the lot where
we found the body.

08:20.486 --> 08:22.355
It's changed hands a few times
since '92,

08:22.413 --> 08:25.251
but for the last six years,
it's been owned...

08:26.786 --> 08:29.359
...It's been owned by a small developer

08:29.648 --> 08:33.518
who's been fighting a neighborhood
group about building on it.

08:34.418 --> 08:36.414
developer lives in Calabas.

08:36.484 --> 08:38.226
As far as I can tell, no gang
connections.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.418
any news from Crippen's dentist?

08:40.488 --> 08:41.422
nothing yet.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.546
Chief, if our body turns out
to be Darrell Rchards,

08:44.630 --> 08:46.511
he definitely could have
been eight-deuce.

08:46.545 --> 08:48.288
It's got to be here!

08:48.518 --> 08:50.757
Lieutenant Provenza,
what are you doing?

08:51.230 --> 08:52.084
Remembering.

08:53.879 --> 08:55.275
There was...

08:55.356 --> 08:58.333
something in one of these
gun reports that rang a bell...

08:58.391 --> 09:00.652
Not the gun per se, but the person
who turned it in...

09:00.710 --> 09:02.233
Our old friend Father Jack.

09:02.279 --> 09:03.780
He brought in a load of weapons

09:03.849 --> 09:06.453
with some "guns for food" initiative

09:06.514 --> 09:07.887
the city started after the riots.

09:07.933 --> 09:10.426
That was in... june.

09:10.991 --> 09:13.483
June 1992.

09:13.703 --> 09:14.665
Who's Father Jack?

09:14.723 --> 09:15.576
He's an asshole.

09:15.623 --> 09:17.636
He's a franciscan priest that
runs a program

09:17.694 --> 09:20.025
that gets gang members off the streets,
finds them work,

09:20.059 --> 09:21.115
and gives them a chance.

09:21.173 --> 09:23.861
Which is another way
of saying Father Jack protects

09:23.988 --> 09:26.427
gangbangers, drug dealers,
and cop killers

09:26.496 --> 09:27.696
from ever getting arrested.

09:27.754 --> 09:30.915
If you have evidence Father Jack
has ever committed a crime,

09:30.950 --> 09:32.703
Why don't you just go arrest him?
I can't

09:32.750 --> 09:35.404
because he hides behind that collar...
When he wears it.

09:35.462 --> 09:36.141
Come on, man!

09:36.199 --> 09:38.114
Ladies, ladies, please.

09:39.049 --> 09:41.540
I remember going to Father Jack's place

09:41.586 --> 09:42.578
right before the iots.

09:42.649 --> 09:45.649
I was looking into a shooting in...

09:45.792 --> 09:47.546
had to have been may.

09:47.616 --> 09:49.173
All right. Here we go.

09:49.208 --> 09:50.235
Here we go.

09:51.827 --> 09:54.435
Someone took some shots
at a police car.

09:55.150 --> 09:57.019
Now, I'd finished. I was leaving.

09:57.217 --> 09:58.083
Kid comes up to me.

09:58.141 --> 10:01.094
I ask him about the shooting.
He said he didn't know anything,

10:01.164 --> 10:03.241
but he, he wanted

10:03.287 --> 10:05.294
to talk about something else.

10:05.352 --> 10:06.864
So I...

10:07.660 --> 10:09.114
I gave him my card.

10:12.690 --> 10:14.237
That was may the 4th.

10:15.737 --> 10:17.838
2 days later, may the 6th,

10:18.368 --> 10:21.011
Darrell Richards is reported missing.

10:22.591 --> 10:24.057
Beginning of june,

10:24.414 --> 10:26.584
Father Jack turns in some guns,

10:26.664 --> 10:29.500
one of which is a colt.38 diamondback.

10:31.311 --> 10:32.119
So...

10:32.777 --> 10:34.358
We can tell Brian in ballistics

10:34.427 --> 10:37.508
that we just narrowed it down for him.

11:04.361 --> 11:06.599
Hi. I'm looking for Father Jack.

11:08.169 --> 11:09.115
Thank you.

11:12.923 --> 11:13.753
Can I help you?

11:13.823 --> 11:15.230
You must be Father Jack.

11:15.323 --> 11:17.538
I'm Deputy Chief Johnson, L.A.P.D.

11:19.969 --> 11:22.395
I need to ask you few questions.
Is that your office over there?

11:22.956 --> 11:24.281
- What's this about?
- I'd prefer

11:24.282 --> 11:25.975
to speak in your office
if you don't mind.

11:25.976 --> 11:26.977
Why not ask me right here?

11:31.712 --> 11:34.928
A body was unearthed on a hillside
in eight-deuce territory.

11:35.468 --> 11:36.720
Well, that's sad, but

11:37.032 --> 11:38.268
it's got nothing to do with me.

11:38.269 --> 11:39.480
Considering that you turned in

11:39.481 --> 11:41.927
the murder weapon, I'd say
it has quite a lot to do with you.

11:42.681 --> 11:43.696
I'll be in your office.

11:44.736 --> 11:45.738
Pardon me.

11:48.380 --> 11:49.844
And you thought nuns were tough.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.841
I remember when
this was a one-room operation.

12:07.842 --> 12:09.690
I mean, it is truly amazing
what you've done.

12:09.691 --> 12:11.828
No, allright, Lieutenant,
that's wonderful news.

12:12.683 --> 12:14.782
Yes, that's great, even with our

12:15.361 --> 12:16.985
budget restraints. Thank you.

12:20.228 --> 12:21.659
Good news, Father.

12:21.660 --> 12:23.060
Thanks to modern dentistry,

12:23.061 --> 12:25.448
we now have a positive i.D.
on our victim...

12:25.545 --> 12:26.546
Darrell Richards.

12:26.748 --> 12:29.406
Now, Lieutenant Provenza here
remembers handing Darrell

12:29.407 --> 12:31.872
- his business card.
- Right outside your doors,

12:32.055 --> 12:33.249
1992.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.379
Did you know him?

12:35.362 --> 12:37.269
You expect me to remember
that far back?

12:38.116 --> 12:40.235
I find that murder weapons
tend to be unforgettable,

12:41.140 --> 12:43.972
and you did turn in the gun
that killed Darrell two weeks

12:44.120 --> 12:46.239
after his mother filed
the missing-persons report.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.107
So, yes, I do expect you to remember.

12:49.594 --> 12:52.291
These kids turn their guns in to me
under the seal of confession.

12:52.792 --> 12:55.065
<i>What about the sacred commandment
"thou shalt not kill"?</i>

12:59.468 --> 13:00.566
This is a photo

13:00.759 --> 13:04.187
that Darrell Richards' mother
gave the police in 1992.

13:04.515 --> 13:06.171
Do you recognize any of
those other boys?

13:07.240 --> 13:07.933
Yes.

13:09.243 --> 13:10.534
Can you tell me who they are?

13:12.107 --> 13:13.109
Ms. Johnson...

13:14.419 --> 13:17.924
I have spent a good part
of the last 20 years

13:18.130 --> 13:21.097
burying kids I love
killed by kids I love.

13:21.289 --> 13:23.581
And the only time anyone
even notices

13:23.986 --> 13:26.586
is when someone wants to
throw one of those kids in jail.

13:27.312 --> 13:28.950
Society has forgotten us.

13:28.969 --> 13:31.030
We don't need more punishment
down here.

13:31.834 --> 13:32.912
We need hope...

13:33.529 --> 13:35.281
- and mercy.
- It's not my job

13:35.339 --> 13:37.785
to forgive and forget.
A boy was murdered.

13:37.805 --> 13:39.557
I attend to the living,
Chief Johnson.

13:40.463 --> 13:41.478
You attend to the dead.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.424
Father, Father, don't you...

13:44.464 --> 13:46.737
Don't you think that Darrell's mother

13:46.794 --> 13:48.855
deserves to know what happened
to her son?

13:51.854 --> 13:52.855
Fine.

13:53.915 --> 13:54.916
Okay.

13:55.610 --> 13:58.942
Here's Darrell Richards'
mother's address.

13:59.289 --> 14:00.290
So...

14:01.185 --> 14:02.187
You go,

14:02.996 --> 14:05.096
and you give her a little closure.

14:05.924 --> 14:07.099
And then you let Darrell

14:07.272 --> 14:09.776
and this community rest in peace.

14:10.628 --> 14:12.535
Closure. Well, Father...

14:13.748 --> 14:15.039
Be careful what you pray for.

14:25.743 --> 14:26.482
Yes?

14:27.129 --> 14:29.460
Hello, I'm Sergeant David Gabriel,
Mrs. Richards.

14:29.479 --> 14:30.828
We're with the L.A.P.D.

14:30.991 --> 14:31.992
Do you have a minute?

14:32.262 --> 14:35.556
We assumed Darrell was dead
15 years ago.

14:36.032 --> 14:37.072
We mourned him.

14:37.322 --> 14:39.248
15 years ago.

14:39.441 --> 14:41.367
I met Darrell once, Mrs. Richards,

14:41.368 --> 14:43.225
outside of Father Jack's place.

14:43.226 --> 14:44.675
He was a very nice kid.

14:44.958 --> 14:47.212
He was a nice kid
after he met Father Jack.

14:51.603 --> 14:52.913
Mrs. Richards, do you

14:53.125 --> 14:55.205
remember the names of any of the boys

14:55.206 --> 14:57.010
in this photo with Darrell?

14:58.358 --> 14:59.360
Oh...

15:01.556 --> 15:03.386
Darrell and his friends...

15:05.923 --> 15:07.406
and that car of his.

15:09.235 --> 15:10.564
He was 19.

15:12.253 --> 15:15.797
He... he was only 19.

15:18.370 --> 15:20.797
I am so sorry,

15:20.798 --> 15:21.908
Mrs. Richards.

15:32.823 --> 15:35.462
What do we know
about Mrs. Richards' other son?

15:35.596 --> 15:38.936
Well, Kenyon Richards is an influential
community activist in Crenshaw.

15:39.048 --> 15:40.280
Great, another cop-hater.

15:40.281 --> 15:41.648
He's not like that.

15:42.195 --> 15:44.313
He had a tough childhood
but turned his life around.

15:44.314 --> 15:45.854
In fact, the last 10 years,

15:45.855 --> 15:47.915
he's done a lot of work
with the L.A.P.D.,

15:47.916 --> 15:49.480
setting up after-school programs.

15:49.517 --> 15:50.981
And I think I read a couple weeks ago

15:50.982 --> 15:53.157
that he's running for a city council
seat in Crenshaw.

15:53.273 --> 15:55.059
He's one of the good guys.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.195
Just like Father Jack.

15:56.388 --> 15:58.834
- You know what you need to do Flynn?
- Hey! Hey, you two.

15:59.103 --> 16:01.473
See if we can get Kenyon to
come on in here and talk to us.

16:01.474 --> 16:02.788
If anyone knows about Darrell,

16:02.789 --> 16:03.996
it ought to be his brother.

16:04.326 --> 16:06.329
Lieutenant Tao, any luck
finding the murder weapon?

16:07.089 --> 16:08.842
Our colt was a stolen weapon,

16:08.843 --> 16:10.536
so it was returned to
its rightful owner,

16:10.537 --> 16:11.981
a gun collector named Marquardt.

16:12.078 --> 16:14.196
Well, go find this Mr. M...

16:15.404 --> 16:17.408
Just go find him... please.

16:18.939 --> 16:20.981
We need that gun brought in
for evidence.

16:21.441 --> 16:22.442
Lieutenant Flynn...

16:22.943 --> 16:24.946
Did we find anything about the paint
on this tarp?

16:25.576 --> 16:26.578
It's white.

16:27.233 --> 16:28.253
Anything useful?

16:28.369 --> 16:29.390
No, sorry, Chief.

16:29.391 --> 16:30.469
Paint's a dead end.

16:30.815 --> 16:33.069
All right, Detective Daniels,

16:33.698 --> 16:36.087
I want a full check on Father Jack's
community center...

16:36.088 --> 16:38.398
Who works there, who visits,
and how it's funded.

16:38.861 --> 16:40.767
Detective Sanchez, you can give her
a hand.

16:40.768 --> 16:41.783
Which one?

16:44.056 --> 16:45.173
Lieutenant Provenza, may I?

16:45.707 --> 16:46.708
Thank you.

16:46.805 --> 16:50.233
Sergeant Gabriel, now that Mrs. Richards
has given us this nice photo

16:50.320 --> 16:51.572
and the names to go with it,

16:51.573 --> 16:54.076
see if y'all can locate some of
those other boys.

16:54.413 --> 16:57.090
We need someone to tell us about
Darrell's last days.

16:57.148 --> 16:58.150
Thank you!

17:14.799 --> 17:16.012
Hi, ma. It's me.

17:16.917 --> 17:18.806
Yeah, Fritz told me what happened.
How's daddy?

17:20.784 --> 17:21.959
Okay, you know what?

17:21.960 --> 17:24.251
I just need to talk to him myself
and get this over with.

17:25.811 --> 17:27.661
I know, ma. Just let me talk to him,

17:27.662 --> 17:28.662
and i'll deal with it.

17:34.107 --> 17:35.456
Why doesn't he want to talk to me?

17:38.325 --> 17:40.155
Read what letter?
Daddy wrote me a letter?

17:52.600 --> 17:55.869
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try again.</i>

17:57.467 --> 18:00.183
Chief... Pope wants us.

18:04.343 --> 18:06.308
Deputy Chief Johnson, Sergeant Gabriel,

18:06.309 --> 18:07.463
this is Kenyon Richards.

18:07.464 --> 18:09.216
I'm very, very sorry about your loss.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.528
Thank you... And thank you for
taking time to see me.

18:13.313 --> 18:14.411
I thought we called you.

18:14.584 --> 18:18.032
Actually, Mr. Richards phoned up
after you went to see his mother

18:18.340 --> 18:19.939
and asked to speak with us.

18:21.551 --> 18:22.976
Either way, here we all are.

18:23.419 --> 18:24.421
Have a seat.

18:25.066 --> 18:27.589
Mr. Richards, let me first of all
assure you that

18:28.301 --> 18:31.171
we will spare no resources
in solving this case.

18:31.300 --> 18:32.302
I can tell.

18:33.207 --> 18:35.942
You people are coming on maybe even
a little too strong.

18:36.713 --> 18:39.949
I assume that you're referring to
the lack of cooperation that I received

18:39.950 --> 18:40.950
from Father Jack.

18:41.134 --> 18:42.829
If he seemed less than helpful,

18:42.944 --> 18:44.716
it's only because he's trying to
protect me.

18:44.986 --> 18:45.987
From what?

18:46.392 --> 18:48.183
I just launched an election campaign.

18:48.703 --> 18:51.073
Can't talk about Darrell
without bringing up my past.

18:51.722 --> 18:54.496
Look, I've never tried to deny
who I was.

18:55.189 --> 18:56.769
I used drugs. I dealt drugs.

18:57.000 --> 18:59.253
I got shot in a drive-by because
I used to be in a gang.

19:00.788 --> 19:01.789
My brother

19:02.300 --> 19:04.178
disappeared or was murdered,

19:05.209 --> 19:07.636
but to bring that all up front
and center during an election

19:08.098 --> 19:09.812
means I'll be talking about who I was,

19:10.351 --> 19:11.372
not who I've become.

19:13.355 --> 19:15.647
Now, if you're serious about solving
my brother's murder,

19:16.379 --> 19:18.324
- I'll help you in any way I can.
- Thank you.

19:20.077 --> 19:22.369
But if this is an opportunity

19:22.383 --> 19:24.290
to bring me down, or Father Jack,

19:25.599 --> 19:29.201
Well, it would be a shame for you all
to underestimate the

19:29.639 --> 19:32.567
bad feelings towards the L.A.P.D.
in neighborhoods like mine.

19:33.386 --> 19:35.466
Well, we're not perfect,

19:35.514 --> 19:38.519
but we have come a long way
since the riots.

19:39.072 --> 19:41.326
Well, it certainly took you long enough
to find Darrell,

19:42.077 --> 19:43.559
who no one here seemed to care about

19:43.560 --> 19:45.101
before I started to run for office.

19:46.180 --> 19:48.087
And, your harassment of Father Jack...

19:48.813 --> 19:51.163
Frankly, that had better just end.

19:51.914 --> 19:53.243
And I say that more for your sake

19:53.513 --> 19:54.515
than for mine.

19:55.401 --> 19:56.402
You know what i'm saying?

19:57.032 --> 19:58.034
We hear you, sir.

19:58.862 --> 20:02.175
And, while I may not always agree
with Father Jack's methods,

20:02.618 --> 20:04.660
I do have great respect for
his commitment

20:04.661 --> 20:05.739
to positive change.

20:06.201 --> 20:08.738
I promise you, on behalf of
the department, we will treat

20:08.950 --> 20:10.876
the Father, your family,

20:11.627 --> 20:13.919
every aspect of this case
with a little more

20:14.458 --> 20:16.250
- sensitivity.
- Thank you.

20:30.943 --> 20:32.291
What?! What?

20:32.292 --> 20:33.601
Where's the mail from yesterday?

20:37.607 --> 20:39.244
Your father's letter didn't come.

20:39.264 --> 20:40.265
Where is the mail?

20:41.123 --> 20:42.394
It's where it always is.

20:49.001 --> 20:50.002
Where's that?

20:50.561 --> 20:52.520
If you looked at your mail daily,

20:53.021 --> 20:55.139
instead of once a week,
you wouldn't have to ask me.

20:57.624 --> 20:58.838
Thank you. Thank you.

21:00.360 --> 21:02.171
The last time I got a letter
from my father,

21:02.845 --> 21:05.965
I was a freshman in college,
and I got a b-minus

21:05.966 --> 21:06.967
in history.

21:09.875 --> 21:12.033
He said I should think
about becoming a stewardess.

21:14.001 --> 21:15.273
Why don't you just call him?

21:15.899 --> 21:16.977
I did call him.

21:17.786 --> 21:19.000
He wouldn't talk to me.

21:20.053 --> 21:22.769
My entire day was filled with
fathers who wouldn't talk to me.

21:24.021 --> 21:25.023
Hey...

21:27.970 --> 21:29.164
I worked with Father Jack

21:29.251 --> 21:30.811
on the FBI's Gang Task Force.

21:30.812 --> 21:31.928
He and I got along.

21:32.577 --> 21:33.524
You want me to call him?

21:33.525 --> 21:36.280
I thought you couldn't do me
any more favors 'cause your friends were

21:36.281 --> 21:37.578
making fun of you at the office.

21:37.579 --> 21:38.581
I'm just trying
to help.

21:38.582 --> 21:41.921
I'm not sure that your using the phone
right now is the best way to do that.

21:44.851 --> 21:47.373
- Don't touch my phone.
- I'm going back in the shower !

21:50.188 --> 21:51.326
I feel sick.

21:57.628 --> 21:58.942
So, Detective Daniels,

21:59.001 --> 22:01.793
what did we find out about
Father Jack and his operations?

22:02.344 --> 22:04.150
Oh. Sorry. Morning.

22:04.326 --> 22:05.840
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

22:06.177 --> 22:07.115
Good morning!

22:07.866 --> 22:10.963
So, just because Father Jack
is not-for-profit

22:11.039 --> 22:12.470
doesn't mean he's not making money.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.558
Since he started the center in 1990,

22:14.593 --> 22:16.341
he's raised all of the funds himself.

22:16.388 --> 22:17.620
Where's the money come from?

22:17.655 --> 22:20.892
From a bunch of little businesses
he runs... A house-painting company.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.669
I wonder if they use any tarps.

22:22.728 --> 22:24.851
They got a small fleet of moving vans,

22:24.898 --> 22:27.753
and there's also a little recording
studio where they make demo tapes,

22:27.770 --> 22:29.095
staffed by gang members.

22:29.142 --> 22:30.503
Ex-gang members.

22:30.562 --> 22:32.931
Which brings us
to his other source of funds.

22:32.978 --> 22:34.570
When gang members
come off the street,

22:34.629 --> 22:37.831
Father Jack encourages them
to donate to his foundation.

22:37.886 --> 22:40.267
It's part of proving they're
serious about getting clean.

22:40.314 --> 22:43.117
Oh, so St. Jack uses dirty money

22:43.257 --> 22:46.377
- to clean up the neighborhood.
- Okay, okay. Gentlemen,

22:46.529 --> 22:50.103
any luck locating and identifying
the boys in this photo?

22:53.723 --> 22:55.882
Michael King... dead.

22:55.940 --> 22:57.635
Alvin Henderson... dead.

22:57.693 --> 23:00.222
Ricky Butler... dead.

23:00.269 --> 23:03.914
Roy Brown... 5 to 10 on
a drug-trafficking conviction.

23:04.158 --> 23:07.794
We talked to him.
And Shawn Jackson...

23:09.049 --> 23:10.735
- Dead.
- Sergeant?

23:10.864 --> 23:14.521
But this guy here in the yellow,
this guy right here, Terry Miller...

23:15.048 --> 23:17.710
Terry Miller,
we've already seen.

23:18.332 --> 23:20.866
Do you recognize anyone
in this photograph, Terry?

23:22.684 --> 23:24.502
Terry, you see
that guy in the back,

23:24.580 --> 23:26.597
in the skullcap... Roy Brown?

23:26.668 --> 23:28.240
We went and visited him in prison,

23:28.310 --> 23:32.380
and he told us that you were all
eight-deuces and that you sold drugs.

23:32.819 --> 23:35.834
We did a lot
of things I ain't too proud of.

23:35.975 --> 23:38.708
Sell drugs?
Yeah, we sold drugs.

23:39.271 --> 23:41.101
Crack, mostly.

23:41.453 --> 23:43.846
But in 1992, Darrell left the gang?

23:45.164 --> 23:46.583
He changed.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.554
Father Jack set him straight.

23:48.624 --> 23:51.492
Yeah, well, in my experience,
gangs don't take it lightly

23:51.539 --> 23:53.603
when one of their members
decides to quit.

23:53.704 --> 23:56.761
Well, Darrell left town before
we could... discuss it...

23:57.418 --> 23:59.001
Or that's what we thought at the time.

23:59.177 --> 24:01.840
When Darrell disappeared,
his family assumed he was dead.

24:01.910 --> 24:03.799
Why do you think he left town?

24:04.078 --> 24:07.456
Woke up one morning, and
2 kilos of my cocaine was gone.

24:07.662 --> 24:10.301
Now, Darrell was the only one
who knew where I kept my stash.

24:10.653 --> 24:11.685
I found him,

24:11.826 --> 24:14.817
and I gave him
24 hours to get it back to me.

24:15.294 --> 24:18.050
Next thing I know, he's gone,
and my coke's gone.

24:20.103 --> 24:22.308
I figured Darrell wanted

24:22.390 --> 24:24.508
to start over somewhere.

24:24.566 --> 24:27.734
Yeah, well, you listen to this.
When did this happen?

24:27.921 --> 24:31.217
I don't know, man. I mean, sometime
around the end of the Riots.

24:32.493 --> 24:34.572
This meeting is over!

24:35.097 --> 24:37.753
I won't allow you to question
anyone from my foundation

24:37.800 --> 24:38.903
without an attorney!

24:38.973 --> 24:40.909
And if you keep harassing us,

24:40.967 --> 24:43.349
I have no problem
going over your head.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.765
Go right ahead, Father.

24:45.835 --> 24:47.841
Oh, bless you, Lieutenant.

24:47.923 --> 24:49.327
Bless you, too.

24:53.780 --> 24:56.008
All right, Sergeant Gabriel,
please check all

24:56.055 --> 24:59.703
the emergency-room records
for may of 1992

25:00.114 --> 25:04.542
and bring me a list of everyone admitted
with a bullet wound during that time.

25:04.613 --> 25:05.680
Thank you.

25:05.962 --> 25:08.302
If Darrell stole that much coke,
there's no way that

25:08.337 --> 25:10.405
Terry would just let him drive
away and disappear.

25:10.441 --> 25:12.674
Yeah, but he didn't
drive away, did he?

25:13.019 --> 25:14.567
He was killed.

25:15.541 --> 25:17.899
So what happened
to his car?

25:18.907 --> 25:20.385
Darrell's car?

25:20.514 --> 25:21.934
I sold it.

25:22.890 --> 25:25.729
Was that before or after
Darrell disappeared?

25:25.776 --> 25:26.937
After.

25:26.984 --> 25:28.544
We needed the extra money.

25:28.615 --> 25:30.134
Do you remember who you sold it to?

25:30.181 --> 25:33.066
Well, we didn't really
sell the car ourselves.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.057
I had Kenyon take it to
Father Jack to sell it for us.

25:39.760 --> 25:41.484
What are you two
doing in...

25:42.575 --> 25:44.088
- You found the gun.
- Yes.

25:44.147 --> 25:46.188
- Did you test-fire it?
- No.

25:46.467 --> 25:48.637
I do not have time
for you two right now.

25:48.684 --> 25:51.831
I just spent the whole day
looking for an '86

25:51.924 --> 25:54.306
blue Monte Carlo and another hour

25:54.417 --> 25:58.123
dragging that priest in,

25:58.187 --> 26:01.085
which means that holy hell
is about to break out in here. So...

26:01.086 --> 26:03.957
if y'all wouldn't mind coming back
when you actually have something...

26:03.958 --> 26:04.967
You didn't let us finish.

26:05.026 --> 26:08.505
The gun spent the last 10 years
in a garage with drainage issues.

26:08.576 --> 26:11.098
It should be a crime to neglect
a revolver like this one.

26:11.168 --> 26:13.262
The gun was rusted out.
It wouldn't fire.

26:13.306 --> 26:15.274
So you couldn't confirm
it is the murder weapon.

26:15.328 --> 26:16.841
We don't need the gun to work.

26:16.911 --> 26:19.325
All we need
are the markings on the barrel.

26:19.407 --> 26:21.941
That bullet
came from this gun.

26:22.140 --> 26:24.205
Great. That's all
I need to know right now.

26:24.275 --> 26:25.718
That's great.
Thank you.

26:28.695 --> 26:29.721
Thanks.

26:32.981 --> 26:34.130
Hello?

26:34.189 --> 26:36.617
- It's me.
- Can I call you back?

26:36.676 --> 26:38.600
I've got an angry priest waiting for me.

26:38.658 --> 26:41.215
I thought you might want to know
what came in the mail today.

26:41.673 --> 26:44.066
- Daddy's letter?
- Yeah, you want me to open it?

26:45.446 --> 26:47.158
No. Wait.

26:48.214 --> 26:49.903
Yes. Open it.

26:50.173 --> 26:51.827
No. Wait...

26:52.104 --> 26:54.028
Shoot! I don't know.

26:54.638 --> 26:56.186
You know what? No.

26:57.019 --> 26:59.682
Don't open it.
I'm gonna open it later,

26:59.749 --> 27:01.203
maybe much later.

27:01.884 --> 27:03.893
Why did you put Father Jack
in an interview room?

27:03.942 --> 27:05.871
Because I want to interview him.

27:05.906 --> 27:07.291
I thought we had an understanding.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.762
Was it really necessary
to march him past news cameras

27:09.798 --> 27:11.895
and put him in a police car
like a common criminal?

27:11.930 --> 27:14.697
There's already a group outside
protesting his arrest.

27:14.756 --> 27:17.512
- I didn't arrest him.
- Good, then release him immediatly,

27:17.653 --> 27:21.301
find one of the thousands cameras
out there, and apologize to it.

27:23.105 --> 27:25.136
- You're not gonna answer that, are you?
- Hello?

27:25.183 --> 27:26.489
Hiya, Chief.

27:31.247 --> 27:33.147
Hold on just for a minute, please.

27:33.265 --> 27:35.845
I'm sorry. It'll just take one minute.
Pardon me.

27:36.092 --> 27:38.285
Excuse me.

27:45.072 --> 27:46.597
Yes, Lieutenant?

27:46.737 --> 27:49.541
I thought you could take an
interruption for some good news.

27:49.928 --> 27:53.696
<i>We managed to arrange Darrell's
car the way you wanted it</i>

27:53.749 --> 27:55.860
<i>and just got the last
of the hospital reports.</i>

27:56.446 --> 27:58.343
Guess who checked in
to county hospital

27:58.401 --> 28:00.900
with a bullet wound
on may 5th.

28:03.516 --> 28:04.912
Thank you, Lieutenant.

28:14.306 --> 28:17.380
I apologize for my detective.
She can be...

28:18.447 --> 28:19.515
... frustrating.

28:19.573 --> 28:21.879
She is a very good detective,
though,

28:21.961 --> 28:24.389
- and most of the time, her...
- Chief.

28:24.448 --> 28:25.550
What?

28:26.899 --> 28:28.269
Oh, my God!

28:32.456 --> 28:35.377
Chief, you got a second to...
Taylor...

28:40.124 --> 28:42.153
Tell me what you did
with Darrell's car.

28:42.349 --> 28:45.278
I thought I made it clear that
i'm not answering any questions.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.451
You did.

28:46.650 --> 28:48.421
Then why am I here,
Ms. Johnson?

28:50.064 --> 28:53.735
You have spent a lot of time protecting
people who have done very bad things.

28:53.829 --> 28:56.527
Now they have a chance
to step up and protect you.

28:58.091 --> 29:00.589
So, basically,

29:00.788 --> 29:02.231
you're holding me hostage.

29:02.290 --> 29:04.601
Well, I like to think of it more as...

29:04.706 --> 29:05.879
Sanctuary.

29:08.129 --> 29:09.747
Excuse me.
Just one minute, please.

29:12.140 --> 29:15.890
I've been very patient with your
confrontational approach, Ms. Johnson,

29:16.148 --> 29:18.586
but I've had about enough.
You need to release Father Jack.

29:18.657 --> 29:19.724
Or what?

29:20.111 --> 29:21.988
Or instead of negotiating
quietly in here,

29:22.023 --> 29:24.193
I'll do it outside with
the protestors and the media.

29:24.248 --> 29:27.573
- I don't respond well to threats...
- No, no, it's fine, Chief Pope.

29:27.643 --> 29:30.371
If Mr. Richards wants to negotiate

29:30.460 --> 29:33.592
for Father Jack's release,
let's negotiate.

29:34.284 --> 29:35.469
Right this way.

29:40.389 --> 29:41.459
After you, sir.

29:43.943 --> 29:45.785
I'm not trying
to threaten anybody,

29:45.949 --> 29:47.861
but Father Jack is not a killer.

29:48.201 --> 29:49.998
And if you want
to treat me as his lawyer,

29:49.999 --> 29:52.295
I'll only advise him not to
answer any of your questions.

29:52.296 --> 29:53.429
"Not a killer"?

29:53.902 --> 29:56.457
He was the last person in
possession of the murder weapon.

29:56.517 --> 29:59.901
He surrounds himself with gangbangers
and drug dealers and now this.

30:03.829 --> 30:05.192
You remember Darrell's car,

30:05.262 --> 30:06.841
the one that Father Jack sold?

30:06.921 --> 30:09.528
<i>The DMV keeps excellent records,
so we were able to trace</i>

30:09.531 --> 30:12.477
<i>the ownership of Darrell's car all the
way back to the junkyard and</i>

30:12.587 --> 30:14.039
<i>reassemble the pieces.</i>

30:14.339 --> 30:16.969
We're DNA testing the blood
that we found in the trunk,

30:17.015 --> 30:19.619
and I'm confident that it will
match Darrell's, which is why

30:19.628 --> 30:22.109
I'd really like to know
where Father Jack was,

30:22.428 --> 30:23.891
15 years ago.

30:26.464 --> 30:28.749
In fact, I'd like to know
where you were.

30:29.213 --> 30:31.109
- Excuse me?
- Where were you

30:31.347 --> 30:32.637
15 years ago?

30:33.412 --> 30:35.029
What are you talking about?

30:36.201 --> 30:37.752
This is a search warrant.

30:40.013 --> 30:42.652
As I've already said,
I want to be helpful,

30:42.805 --> 30:45.145
so go ahead...
search my office, search my house.

30:45.247 --> 30:47.814
I don't care about what's in your house.
I care about the bullet

30:47.816 --> 30:49.261
that's in your leg.

30:51.125 --> 30:53.277
<i>Kenyon Richards, you have
the right to remain silent.</i>

30:53.279 --> 30:56.060
<i>Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.</i>

30:56.063 --> 30:58.766
<i>You have the right to an attorney.
If you can't afford one,</i>

30:58.767 --> 31:00.156
<i>the court will provide one for you.</i>

31:00.157 --> 31:01.903
<i>Have you heard and
understood these rights?</i>

31:01.907 --> 31:03.801
Yes, but I have no idea what you're...

31:07.585 --> 31:08.722
Pardon me.

31:12.643 --> 31:14.287
Officer. Thank you.

31:17.589 --> 31:19.536
- Lieutenant Provenza, already...
- Don't...

31:19.767 --> 31:21.441
Don't... don't do this.

31:21.717 --> 31:22.571
What?

31:23.581 --> 31:25.430
Sergeant, now is not the time
to discuss this.

31:25.434 --> 31:27.282
Kenyon Richards devotes his life

31:27.366 --> 31:30.283
to feeding and helping people,
saving lives in the poorest

31:30.291 --> 31:33.180
- communities in this city.
- We will talk about this later.

31:33.309 --> 31:34.978
If you, if you arrest...

31:35.200 --> 31:36.628
him,
you will be sending a message

31:36.655 --> 31:39.060
to every gangster in town,
that there's no point to change,

31:39.081 --> 31:41.967
that they're beyond forgiveness,
no matter who they become,

31:41.984 --> 31:45.450
- they will always be who they were.
- I am not sending a message.

31:45.629 --> 31:47.586
I'm solving a murder.
That is my job.

31:50.827 --> 31:54.276
I thought our job
was to protect and serve.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.606
Who are we protecting
by sending him to prison?

31:56.617 --> 31:57.801
Who are we serving?

31:57.862 --> 31:59.944
Okay, I don't know
who Kenyon Richards was

32:00.018 --> 32:03.485
15 years ago, but the man he is
today, the man that he has become,

32:03.882 --> 32:05.954
does not deserve this.

32:07.626 --> 32:09.881
That is for a judge and jury to decide.

32:10.237 --> 32:11.021
Now,

32:11.062 --> 32:14.270
If you are ready to substitute your own
personal sense of right and wrong

32:14.309 --> 32:15.287
for the law,

32:15.495 --> 32:20.060
which is what we are sworn to uphold,
you should turn your badge in today.

32:21.650 --> 32:22.811
Step aside.

32:27.990 --> 32:28.734
Now.

32:32.704 --> 32:35.037
I said, step aside, Sergeant.

32:45.417 --> 32:47.970
There's no way
I'm letting you cut open my leg.

32:48.049 --> 32:49.590
That's an unreasonable search.

32:49.625 --> 32:51.851
Well, I have a judge who says otherwise.

32:52.707 --> 32:57.418
Because on may 5, 1992,
at 3:25 a.m.,

32:57.491 --> 33:00.815
roughly 36 hours before your mother
filed that missing-persons report

33:00.834 --> 33:01.825
on your brother,

33:01.934 --> 33:04.798
you were admitted to the hospital
with a gunshot wound.

33:04.936 --> 33:07.648
They cleaned and they stitched
the wound, but they did not remove

33:07.695 --> 33:08.636
the bullet.

33:08.757 --> 33:12.150
<i>They also said that the bullet entered
your leg from an unusual angle,</i>

33:12.197 --> 33:15.065
<i>suggesting that you were shot during
some sort of close struggle.</i>

33:15.196 --> 33:16.428
It's all in there.

33:16.553 --> 33:18.498
That doesn't prove a thing.

33:19.240 --> 33:20.322
This does.

33:21.529 --> 33:24.368
This is the bullet that was lodged
in your brother's chest.

33:24.499 --> 33:28.331
It ripped through his armpit,
went straight through his heart...

33:28.412 --> 33:30.398
also indicating a close struggle.

33:30.547 --> 33:33.487
And I'm confident that ballistics
will match this bullet with the one

33:33.493 --> 33:34.933
that is in your leg.

33:35.377 --> 33:37.326
All of which means
that on may 5th,

33:37.401 --> 33:39.700
you and your brother were
both shot by the same gun.

33:41.591 --> 33:42.528
This gun.

33:43.320 --> 33:44.954
The one you struggled over.

33:48.717 --> 33:51.665
- This is political assassination.
- I don't care.

33:52.375 --> 33:53.764
About politics.

33:56.489 --> 33:58.688
I'm much more concerned
with the facts.

33:59.290 --> 34:00.099
Facts.

34:00.464 --> 34:02.864
- Facts can be manipulated.
- Yes, they can,

34:02.909 --> 34:05.387
like when you claimed
you were shot in a drive-by

34:05.587 --> 34:07.418
or when you told the Crenshaw

34:07.443 --> 34:09.474
neighborhood council,
and I quote...

34:10.047 --> 34:14.322
"The development of parcel 5596 would
be detrimental to the flow of traffic

34:14.333 --> 34:16.634
<i>and displace 30 to 40
low-income houses."</i>

34:16.659 --> 34:17.694
<i>On quote.</i>

34:18.136 --> 34:20.728
You manipulated the facts
to stop anyone from uncovering

34:20.737 --> 34:22.243
the body of your brother,

34:22.389 --> 34:24.443
who you shot in the heart,

34:24.456 --> 34:27.627
wrapped in this tarp, shoved
in the trunk of his car,

34:27.634 --> 34:29.514
and buried in an unmarked grave.

34:30.139 --> 34:32.108
You manipulated the facts
to make everyone think

34:32.112 --> 34:34.348
that Darrell's disappearance
changed your life.

34:34.375 --> 34:36.237
No, that's the truth.

34:36.763 --> 34:39.482
What happened to Darrell
took me to Father Jack,

34:39.719 --> 34:40.900
and I changed.

34:41.395 --> 34:44.128
I devoted myself to...
to caring for others.

34:44.219 --> 34:47.630
Every day, I struggled with making
a difference in my community.

34:48.743 --> 34:50.315
The work I've done,

34:50.596 --> 34:52.159
the work I want to do...

34:53.463 --> 34:55.168
I am Darrell's legacy.

34:55.472 --> 34:57.841
I've already saved
more lives than you ever will,

34:58.099 --> 34:59.496
and I can save more.

34:59.875 --> 35:02.086
I can save more.

35:02.291 --> 35:04.344
You save lives? Great.

35:05.365 --> 35:08.368
Give me back the life of your brother,
and we will call it even.

35:10.258 --> 35:11.889
We don't live in a world

35:11.986 --> 35:15.172
where you get to kill people and then
decide how to make up for it.

35:16.136 --> 35:16.991
Now...

35:19.188 --> 35:22.187
you know about
the mercy of God, Kenyon,

35:22.692 --> 35:24.748
but the courts
can be merciful, too.

35:25.866 --> 35:27.230
You were a minor.

35:27.743 --> 35:29.228
You made a mistake.

35:29.655 --> 35:32.153
The justice system
will take that into account.

35:32.971 --> 35:34.285
But for mercy...

35:34.865 --> 35:37.492
The courts require the truth.

35:40.536 --> 35:43.348
Now, a common criminal
might lawyer up and fight this,

35:44.047 --> 35:46.070
start a riot to protect himself,

35:46.287 --> 35:48.360
but that's not what you are.

35:49.099 --> 35:51.622
If Darrell's death really changed you,

35:52.386 --> 35:55.314
now's the time to tell the truth
and see how people take it.

36:21.822 --> 36:23.807
Darrell, Terry,
and those guys,

36:24.162 --> 36:25.851
back when they used to deal,

36:27.746 --> 36:29.874
I knew where they kept
their stash, so...

36:31.123 --> 36:33.342
I used to steal
a little bit every now and then.

36:34.688 --> 36:36.407
I thought Darrell never knew.

36:39.176 --> 36:40.338
Anyway, the...

36:40.609 --> 36:42.064
riots went off,

36:42.572 --> 36:44.328
and, things were crazy.

36:44.888 --> 36:47.432
People were settling scores
and stealing stuff.

36:47.739 --> 36:49.929
I took a couple bags of coke
from Terry.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.181
Anyway...

36:56.102 --> 36:57.044
Darrell

36:57.363 --> 36:59.670
came home from work, and
he knew I had the drugs, so

36:59.671 --> 37:02.397
he snatched me in the backyard,
tried to take them from me.

37:05.073 --> 37:06.391
But I was high.

37:08.965 --> 37:11.205
He came at me,
and I had a gun.

37:11.901 --> 37:13.423
He tried to grab it from me.

37:17.523 --> 37:19.583
It went off,
and it hit me in the leg.

37:20.845 --> 37:22.180
I was so mad.

37:22.209 --> 37:23.374
I was just...

37:23.387 --> 37:25.093
I just was so mad. I...

37:29.757 --> 37:31.300
I pulled the trigger.

37:34.410 --> 37:35.582
I shot him.

37:36.223 --> 37:39.402
Oh, God, I shot him.
I killed my brother.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.512
He just stared at me.

37:48.124 --> 37:49.250
He just...

37:49.341 --> 37:51.126
He just stared at me.

37:53.625 --> 37:56.553
I'm so... so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

38:01.625 --> 38:02.935
I'm so sorry.

38:06.127 --> 38:07.170
Do you...

38:08.697 --> 38:10.420
Do you really think
they'll forgive me?

38:10.495 --> 38:11.300
I do.

38:14.074 --> 38:15.588
And you're under arrest.

38:45.913 --> 38:47.543
May I go speak with him?

38:49.108 --> 38:50.051
Of course.

38:57.312 --> 38:59.185
It's right down the hall.

39:00.247 --> 39:01.974
- Thank you.
- Sure.

39:12.863 --> 39:13.822
Sergeant.

39:15.622 --> 39:17.778
I'm not really in any hurry
to get home.

39:17.906 --> 39:18.907
There's a...

39:18.956 --> 39:23.841
a letter waiting for me that, I'm not
sure I can face just yet. So...

39:24.142 --> 39:25.542
I don't know. If you want

39:27.439 --> 39:28.888
Talk about earlier.

39:29.107 --> 39:30.406
Not particularly.

39:34.028 --> 39:35.603
So... we okay?

39:36.192 --> 39:37.125
I'm fine.

40:11.059 --> 40:12.810
You need anything, Chief?

40:13.004 --> 40:13.640
No.

40:14.250 --> 40:15.084
Thanks.

40:15.358 --> 40:18.612
Sergeant Gabriel left, so I got
to book all this evidence.

40:19.333 --> 40:20.564
I'll do that.

40:24.752 --> 40:26.551
You know, Lieutenant...

40:27.786 --> 40:30.810
may of 1992,
that was a chaotic time.

40:31.115 --> 40:32.402
- Yeah.
- There was riots,

40:32.405 --> 40:33.965
and there was looters...

40:35.172 --> 40:36.787
dozens of murders.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.102
And you were investigating
a shooting with no victims.

40:40.148 --> 40:41.619
There's not
an officer on this force

40:41.628 --> 40:43.570
that would have done
anything different.

40:44.350 --> 40:45.705
You're right.

40:47.140 --> 40:48.151
You're right.

40:48.937 --> 40:50.659
I've got a lot of really...

40:50.685 --> 40:53.919
excellent excuses
for not following up with a...

40:55.038 --> 40:58.314
scared kid who just wanted
to turn his life around.

41:02.857 --> 41:05.046
But Darrell Richards is still dead.

41:06.447 --> 41:07.909
Let me do that.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.097
My card.

41:12.736 --> 41:13.684
My case.

41:28.653 --> 41:29.670
<i>Brenda?</i>

41:31.758 --> 41:32.693
Brenda?

41:41.266 --> 41:43.352
- You all right?
- Yes.

41:45.105 --> 41:46.400
You found it.

41:47.417 --> 41:49.559
- Did you open it?
- I can't.

41:50.615 --> 41:51.686
You read it.

42:08.743 --> 42:09.507
Wait.

42:10.518 --> 42:12.367
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:12.734 --> 42:13.491
Wait.

42:17.914 --> 42:19.401
This is all my fault.

42:21.628 --> 42:23.935
I've been lying to my daddy
for so long,

42:24.312 --> 42:25.681
and I blamed you.

42:28.678 --> 42:30.006
I'm so sorry.

42:31.312 --> 42:33.584
This is my fault.
It's just... It's all my fault.

42:33.637 --> 42:34.628
It's not...

42:35.055 --> 42:36.330
All your fault.

42:37.071 --> 42:38.823
I mean, maybe, I sort of...

42:39.664 --> 42:41.166
Subconsciously...

42:42.402 --> 42:45.468
- answered that phone on purpose.
- But I made you do it.

42:50.411 --> 42:51.802
Can you forgive me?

42:54.702 --> 42:56.394
I forgive you, Brenda.

42:57.441 --> 42:59.129
And so does your father.
