WEBVTT

00:08.275 --> 00:09.675
Boss, 911 just got a call

00:09.677 --> 00:11.443
from a little girl
identifying herself

00:11.445 --> 00:14.613
as Riley Adler.
Patch her through.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.315
Riley?

00:16.317 --> 00:18.384
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm Greg Parker.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.485
I'm a police officer.

00:19.487 --> 00:20.719
Are you okay?

00:20.721 --> 00:22.054
I'm scared.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.255
You were really brave

00:23.257 --> 00:24.390
calling 911.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.558
Can you tell me
where you are?

00:26.560 --> 00:27.726
We're in the drugstore.

00:27.728 --> 00:29.061
What about you, though?

00:29.063 --> 00:30.529
Are you okay?

00:31.298 --> 00:33.399
(phone beeps)

00:33.401 --> 00:35.501
Riley?

00:41.742 --> 00:43.409
Yeah, I know she
should've told me,

00:43.411 --> 00:45.711
but Joanne and I
don't exactly talk.

00:46.680 --> 00:49.148
Yeah. Well,
thanks again, though.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.417
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.584
What's wrong?

00:52.586 --> 00:54.720
Dean had an accident
on his dirt bike.

00:54.722 --> 00:57.156
Is he okay?
Yeah.
He broke his arm.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.158
But I had to find out
through Facebook.

00:59.160 --> 01:01.460
Well, at least he sent
you a message, right?
Nah,

01:01.462 --> 01:03.162
he never confirmed me
as a friend.

01:03.164 --> 01:05.464
He did friend my cousin, though,
and that's how I found out--

01:05.466 --> 01:07.499
through her.
If it makes you
feel any better,

01:07.501 --> 01:09.334
Clark didn't confirm me
as a friend, either.

01:09.336 --> 01:11.503
Yeah, but your son doesn't
live 2,000 miles away.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.505
Planes go to Dallas, boss.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.808
She won't let me
through the front door, Eddie.

01:15.810 --> 01:17.376
So you bring a ram.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.445
(chuckles)
Right?

01:27.755 --> 01:29.455
(camera shutter clicks)

01:33.461 --> 01:34.793
(camera shutter clicks)

01:36.197 --> 01:37.496
(shutter clicks)

01:38.599 --> 01:40.399
(shutter clicks)

01:40.401 --> 01:44.169
(shutter clicking)

01:49.343 --> 01:51.310
No...!

01:51.311 --> 01:53.278
I gave you a warning, Becky,
you didn't listen.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.580
You're gonna have
a time-out.

01:54.582 --> 01:56.215
It's not fair!

01:56.217 --> 01:58.550
Well, maybe next time Mommy
says no, you'll listen.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.786
I don't like you anymore!
(whining)

02:01.822 --> 02:03.388
You sit here
for five minutes.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.523
Do<i> not</i> get up.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.458
(grunts, cries)

02:06.460 --> 02:08.794
WOMAN: Mm, she's got
a mind of her own.

02:08.796 --> 02:10.696
(laughs) You know,
I keep telling myself,

02:10.698 --> 02:13.365
someday that's
gonna come in handy.
I know.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.334
Aaron, no biting!

02:15.336 --> 02:16.602
(sighs)
Do you mind?

02:16.604 --> 02:18.437
Oh, here.
Thank you.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.805
Hi!

02:21.809 --> 02:23.475
Guys...

02:23.477 --> 02:25.511
Hey, be careful, okay?
You guys be careful.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.146
One after the other.

02:27.148 --> 02:28.547
(woman continues
speaking indistinctly)

02:28.549 --> 02:30.249
One after the other.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.450
(shutter clicks)

02:32.720 --> 02:35.554
(shutter clicks)

02:36.724 --> 02:38.924
(shutter clicks)

02:45.332 --> 02:47.566
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:47.568 --> 02:50.335
Is that an
ultrasound?

02:50.337 --> 02:52.571
Are you kidding me?
No joke.

02:53.474 --> 02:55.407
(quietly):
Buddy!

02:56.377 --> 02:57.910
When are you due?

02:57.912 --> 02:59.645
I hate to break it to you, boss,

02:59.647 --> 03:01.613
but it's the lady
that carries the baby.

03:01.615 --> 03:03.549
Hm. Your boys can still swim.

03:03.551 --> 03:04.716
How about that?

03:04.718 --> 03:06.585
Hm.

03:06.587 --> 03:07.486
How does it feel?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.288
I'm getting used
to the idea.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.422
So is Sophie.

03:10.424 --> 03:11.590
Clark's almost
out of the house,

03:11.592 --> 03:13.325
now it's back to
changing diapers

03:13.327 --> 03:16.395
and 3:00 a.m. feedings.
And a husband who
works all the time.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.363
It's a second chance-- time
to do things differently.

03:18.365 --> 03:19.798
I'd give my right arm for that.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.202
Aw...
Thanks, Jenna.

03:23.204 --> 03:25.504
Oh, no problem.

03:26.473 --> 03:28.207
Becky?

03:28.209 --> 03:29.308
(groans)
What's wrong?

03:29.310 --> 03:30.375
She's gone.

03:30.377 --> 03:31.376
Becky!

03:31.378 --> 03:32.511
Don't worry,
we'll find her.

03:32.513 --> 03:33.579
(sighs)

03:33.581 --> 03:34.746
Becky?

03:34.748 --> 03:36.648
Becky?

03:36.650 --> 03:38.650
Becky!

03:38.652 --> 03:40.686
Becky!

03:40.688 --> 03:41.853
She's gone!

03:41.855 --> 03:42.854
Becky!

03:42.856 --> 03:44.323
Becky?

03:44.325 --> 03:46.491
(sobbing):
Becky! Where are you?

03:46.493 --> 03:47.893
Becky!

03:47.895 --> 03:49.595
Becky?

03:49.597 --> 03:51.997
(sobbing):
I can't find my daughter.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.399
(in distance):
Becky!

03:54.401 --> 03:56.301
Team One, hot call.
Five-year-old girl,

03:56.303 --> 03:58.470
Becky Corday,
kidnapped from Bridgman Park.

03:58.472 --> 04:00.305
What do we know?
Eyewitness reported seeing

04:00.307 --> 04:02.307
a strange man hanging around
taking pictures.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.676
Got an ID: Clarence Fogle,
recently released

04:04.678 --> 04:06.578
child molester, lives
three blocks from that park.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.681
Winnie, get his photo
and his address

04:09.683 --> 04:10.916
uploaded to our PDAs now.

04:10.918 --> 04:11.950
WINNIE:
Copy that.

04:11.952 --> 04:14.553
(sirens wailing)

04:19.560 --> 04:21.393
Police!
SRU!

04:21.395 --> 04:23.528
Police!
SRU!

04:23.530 --> 04:25.897
Police!
Let's see some hands!
Boss...

04:25.899 --> 04:27.299
Let's see some hands!

04:27.301 --> 04:28.400
ED:
Got anything?

04:28.402 --> 04:29.401
PARKER:
Nothing.

04:29.403 --> 04:31.603
Spike?
Police! SRU!

04:31.605 --> 04:32.738
Police!

04:34.642 --> 04:36.642
I got a visual.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.913
We've got a runner!

04:41.915 --> 04:43.749
Sam, let's go! Let's go!

04:43.751 --> 04:45.751
(panting)

04:51.725 --> 04:53.825
Sam, head him off.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.661
Wordy.

05:00.901 --> 05:03.568
(panting)

05:04.905 --> 05:07.673
(grunting)

05:07.675 --> 05:09.808
(groans)
Subject in custody.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.076
Any sign of Becky?

05:11.078 --> 05:12.978
SPIKE:
Searched every inch
of the house.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.747
She's not here.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.515
WINNIE:
Boss, I got a picture
of Becky Corday.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.051
I'm uploading it now.
Copy that.

05:22.623 --> 05:26.391
JULES:
Boss, take a look at this.

05:36.537 --> 05:38.737
I guess old habits die hard.

05:38.739 --> 05:40.439
SPIKE:
Wait, is that her?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.840
Check your PDA.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.349
That's Becky Corday.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.553
Eddie, we found pictures
of, uh, Becky.

05:54.555 --> 05:57.856
Looks like Fogle's had
his eye on her for a while.

05:57.858 --> 05:58.957
Get up!
(grunting)

06:00.494 --> 06:01.727
Where is she?!
Who?

06:01.729 --> 06:03.762
You know damn
well who.
No, I don't.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.996
Don't lie to me,
Clarence.

06:04.998 --> 06:06.498
Does that
look familiar?

06:06.500 --> 06:08.700
I've never seen her before.
Don't lie to me!

06:08.702 --> 06:10.869
We found pictures
of her in your house.
We know you've

06:10.871 --> 06:12.793
been watching her.
That's your
thing, right?

06:12.794 --> 06:14.716
Little girls, right?
No, I don't do
that anymore.

06:14.717 --> 06:16.639
You don't? Then what
were you doing at the
playground today?
I wasn't.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.677
Don't lie to me!
Don't lie to me, Clarence!
I'm not. I'm not.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.078
We know you were there
taking pictures.

06:20.080 --> 06:21.930
We have witnesses, Clarence.

06:21.931 --> 06:23.781
You have five seconds
to tell me where
Becky Corday is.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.685
One, two, three, four...
Okay, I saw her
at the park!

06:26.687 --> 06:29.955
But I never
touched her, I swear.

06:29.957 --> 06:31.823
Pulled the memory card
from Fogle's camera.

06:31.825 --> 06:32.991
These are from today.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.767
PARKER:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a minute.

06:41.769 --> 06:44.469
That picture was
taken at 10:38.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.738
And Becky disappeared
between 10:15 and 10:25.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.808
Fogle didn't take her.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.577
He's telling the truth.

06:52.579 --> 06:54.212
Uncuff me.

06:54.213 --> 06:55.846
Winnie, give me a couple
of uniforms down here.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.682
Clarence Fogle's
going back to jail.

06:57.684 --> 06:59.568
For what?!
Violating your
parole, Clarence.

06:59.569 --> 07:01.453
You shouldn't have been
within a hundred yards
of that playground.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.055
Wordy, get him out of here.

07:04.057 --> 07:06.091
Well, we got a pedophile
off the street.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.628
Yeah, well, it doesn't
get us any closer to
finding that little girl.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.280
JULES:
She's been missing
for almost an hour.

07:11.281 --> 07:12.931
Spike, issue an AMBER Alert,
get Becky's picture

07:12.933 --> 07:14.866
to every media outlet
and patrol officer

07:14.868 --> 07:16.668
within a hundred-mile radius.
Copy that.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.770
Jules, let's talk to the mom--
maybe she can tell us

07:18.772 --> 07:21.156
who might have a reason
to take her daughter.

07:21.157 --> 07:23.541
You think it's personal?
Right now I'm not
ruling anything out.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.914
Here, I-I've got lots
more pictures of Becky
if you need them.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.016
I took that one
yesterday.

07:31.018 --> 07:33.919
She loves playing dress-up--
she changes

07:33.921 --> 07:36.154
five times a day.
What was Becky wearing today?

07:36.156 --> 07:37.556
A white hat

07:37.558 --> 07:39.825
and a pink coat, pink skirt.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.060
(sniffles)
Pink's her favorite color.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.796
(sobbing):
I shouldn't have turned my back.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.898
I should have been watching her.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.034
Please, you have
to find her!

07:49.036 --> 07:51.503
Mrs. Corday, we're gonna
do everything we can

07:51.505 --> 07:52.804
to get your daughter back.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.473
Okay.
Can you think of anybody

07:54.475 --> 07:55.774
who'd want to take Becky?

07:55.776 --> 07:57.609
No, no one.

07:57.611 --> 07:58.777
Your husband--
any reason he

07:58.779 --> 08:00.212
might take her
without telling you?

08:00.214 --> 08:01.680
No.

08:01.682 --> 08:03.248
No marital problems?
Course not.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.884
Tim's not even here;
he's in Montreal on business.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.053
How long has he been there?
Two days.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.788
What does he do?
He's a lawyer.

08:09.790 --> 08:11.022
PARKER:
Okay. Well,

08:11.024 --> 08:12.724
enemies you might have?

08:12.726 --> 08:14.659
Someone holding a grudge?
I don't know,

08:14.661 --> 08:15.894
it's possible--
he's been working

08:15.896 --> 08:17.729
on some pretty big cases lately.

08:17.731 --> 08:18.930
We're gonna need
to talk to him,

08:18.932 --> 08:20.765
if we can get his
cell number from you.

08:20.767 --> 08:23.068
Yeah, of course.
How about you--
can you think of

08:23.070 --> 08:25.770
anybody who'd want
to hurt you by taking Becky?
I'm a stay-at-home mom.

08:25.772 --> 08:28.507
The only people I see
are other parent...

08:28.509 --> 08:29.774
(sobbing)
She's just

08:29.776 --> 08:30.909
a little girl.

08:30.911 --> 08:33.211
(continues sobbing)

08:33.213 --> 08:34.813
Who'd want to do
something like this?

08:34.815 --> 08:36.948
SPIKE:
Boss, I got something
you should see.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.250
Okay, Spike,
we'll be right there.

08:38.252 --> 08:39.918
Mrs. Corday,

08:39.920 --> 08:41.219
that officer's gonna
take you home.

08:41.221 --> 08:42.821
You try to relax, okay?

08:42.823 --> 08:45.290
We'll call you as soon
as we know anything.

08:45.292 --> 08:46.591
Thank you.

08:46.593 --> 08:47.993
(door opens)

08:49.530 --> 08:51.596
Take a look at this.
(door closes)

08:52.900 --> 08:54.900
It's another little girl.

08:54.902 --> 08:56.701
SPIKE:
No, look in the background.

08:56.703 --> 08:58.637
PARKER:
That's a lot of pink.

08:58.639 --> 09:00.038
Is it Becky?
PARKER:
Can you zoom in?

09:03.143 --> 09:04.976
JULES:
That's definitely Becky.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.679
And that's our kidnapper.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.981
JULES:
Kidnapper's a woman.

09:16.089 --> 09:17.822
WOMAN (over P.A.):
Only three percent

09:17.824 --> 09:20.258
of the world's water supply
is freshwater,

09:20.260 --> 09:23.695
...agriculture, industry...

09:23.697 --> 09:25.697
Isn't it pretty?

09:25.699 --> 09:26.965
...and for recreation,

09:26.967 --> 09:30.702
making it the world's most
precious resource.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.836
(quietly):
Okay, class.

09:31.838 --> 09:33.972
Let's move on
to the next exhibit, okay?

09:33.974 --> 09:34.940
Come on.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.942
Don't forget your coat.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.894
(children speaking quietly)
Okay.

09:38.895 --> 09:40.845
(children continue speaking
quietly)

09:40.847 --> 09:42.180
James, your hat?

09:42.182 --> 09:43.715
You had a hat
when you came in.

09:43.717 --> 09:47.085
All right, let's go.

09:51.024 --> 09:53.024
Guys, walking, please.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.030
Riley?

09:59.032 --> 10:00.098
Hi.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.967
Great show, huh?

10:01.969 --> 10:03.435
Yeah.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.902
Do you want to go check out
the mini roller coaster?

10:04.905 --> 10:06.004
I don't know.

10:06.006 --> 10:07.005
Could be fun.

10:07.007 --> 10:08.907
Can I help you?

10:08.909 --> 10:10.609
Oh, we were just talking.

10:10.611 --> 10:13.044
Okay, Riley, let's stay
with the class, okay?

10:13.046 --> 10:13.912
RILEY:
Okay.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.146
Let me go!
No, Riley,

10:15.148 --> 10:16.381
it's okay.
What are you doing?

10:16.383 --> 10:18.216
Let go of her!
Just stay back!

10:18.218 --> 10:19.851
(girls screaming)
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God!

10:19.853 --> 10:21.920
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.054
Just don't come
any closer.

10:25.859 --> 10:29.928
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

11:01.962 --> 11:04.062
(sirens approaching)

11:04.064 --> 11:07.132
(sirens wailing)

11:14.174 --> 11:15.974
(sirens stop)

11:15.976 --> 11:18.076
Okay, people, listen up.

11:18.078 --> 11:21.413
Subject is Caucasian female
with long blonde hair,

11:21.415 --> 11:23.748
last seen wearing
a black coat.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.300
In addition to Becky Corday,

11:25.301 --> 11:26.851
she's now abducted
an eight-year-old, Riley Adler.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.119
PARKER:
As soon as that happened,

11:28.121 --> 11:29.320
security locked down
the building,

11:29.322 --> 11:30.822
so we know she's still in there.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.191
Let's go. Let's go.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.759
SAM:
Does she have a weapon?

11:34.761 --> 11:35.927
She's got a knife.

11:35.929 --> 11:37.862
This place is a
containment nightmare.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.831
Situated on a couple
hundred acres,

11:39.833 --> 11:40.932
backs out onto a ravine.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.100
It's not good.

11:42.102 --> 11:43.702
It's spread out
over six levels.

11:43.704 --> 11:45.870
Each one's got
exhibits, gift shops.

11:45.872 --> 11:47.806
(sighs):
A lot of hiding places.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.274
We need to establish
a hard perimeter.

11:49.276 --> 11:51.776
Sam, I need you to
coordinate with
the uniforms.

11:51.778 --> 11:53.461
We're gonna need
help evacuating.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.145
SAM:
Copy that.
You got a containment area?

11:55.148 --> 11:57.015
SPIKE:
Yeah. There's an auditorium
on the fourth floor.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.383
Should be big enough
to hold everyone.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.751
Spike, talk to security.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.486
Find out where
the video cameras are.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.220
Maybe we can get a visual
of the kidnapper.
On it.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.823
This place is full
of kids, guys.

12:04.825 --> 12:05.857
Strictly less-lethal.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.325
No flashbangs,
no CS gas.

12:07.327 --> 12:08.827
Where was
she last seen?

12:08.829 --> 12:10.612
Right outside
the theater.

12:10.613 --> 12:12.396
We're gonna start there,
we're gonna work our way out.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.432
SAM:
Okay. We're taking
you to a safe area

12:14.434 --> 12:16.334
until the situation's
under control.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.237
PARKER:
<i> Do you have any idea</i>

12:19.239 --> 12:20.972
why this woman
chose Riley?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.941
Was she lagging behind,
separated from the group?

12:22.943 --> 12:25.877
The woman was talking to her.
She called her by name.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.779
So, Riley knew her?
I don't think so.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.948
She was terrified.
She didn't want to go with her.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.282
What about the
other little girl?

12:31.284 --> 12:32.417
Did Riley
recognize her?

12:32.419 --> 12:33.818
I don't think so.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.520
She kept begging me
to help her.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.356
The woman had a knife.
I didn't know what to do.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.225
It's okay. You did
everything you could.

12:40.227 --> 12:42.794
Are you sure you haven't
seen this woman before?

12:42.796 --> 12:44.429
Maybe hanging around
the school or something?

12:44.431 --> 12:45.930
No. I didn't
recognize her.

12:45.932 --> 12:46.898
Okay. Thank you.

12:46.900 --> 12:48.066
You go with
this officer.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.934
He'll take care
of you. Thank you.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.936
These kidnappings
weren't random.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.104
Let's get both sets of parents
down here.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.272
Maybe they can help us

12:54.274 --> 12:55.674
<i> figure out the connection.</i>

12:55.675 --> 12:57.075
Folks, we need you to
exit the exhibit, please.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.977
Follow the officer
in the hall.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.546
Innovation Center
secure.

13:01.548 --> 13:03.047
Sam, any sign of the subject?

13:03.049 --> 13:05.517
Nothing so far.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.823
Nothing on the live feed?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.308
It's a big place.

13:13.309 --> 13:14.792
A lot of areas not covered
by security cameras.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.194
There is, however, one
at the main entrance.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.428
And this footage was

13:17.430 --> 13:20.031
taken less than an hour ago.
There she is.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.000
Can you...
Isolate her face?
It's already done.

13:22.002 --> 13:24.402
Oh, getting a little cocky,
aren't you, Michelangelo?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.504
I'm gunning for a raise, boss.

13:26.506 --> 13:28.072
PARKER:
That's great.

13:28.074 --> 13:29.841
That's great.
Make a couple copies.

13:29.843 --> 13:31.576
See if the parents
can make an ID.

13:31.578 --> 13:32.944
Got it.
Nice.

13:32.946 --> 13:34.345
Thanks.

13:34.347 --> 13:36.948
JENNA:
I've never seen

13:36.950 --> 13:38.166
this woman before.

13:38.167 --> 13:39.383
What does she want
with our children?

13:39.386 --> 13:41.586
Mr. and Mrs. Adler,
do you recognize this woman?

13:41.588 --> 13:42.954
I'm not sure.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.255
It looks a lot
like her.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.557
Like who?

13:45.559 --> 13:47.025
She's supposed
to be in jail.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.492
If you know who she is,
please tell us.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.395
I think it's
Maggie Perrello.

13:50.397 --> 13:51.896
Riley's birth mother.

13:51.898 --> 13:53.164
Your daughter is adopted?

13:53.166 --> 13:54.399
JENNA:
Oh, my God.

13:54.401 --> 13:56.568
Becky was adopted, too.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.203
I think we found
our connection.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.306
Yeah, this woman's trying
to kidnap her own kids?

14:01.308 --> 14:02.841
Spike, we got an ID.

14:02.843 --> 14:03.842
Maggie Perrello.

14:03.844 --> 14:05.043
She's in the system.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.411
On it.

14:06.413 --> 14:08.947
Why didn't you tell us
your daughter was adopted?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.281
Well, I-I didn't think of it.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.317
We've had Becky
since she was 11 months.

14:12.319 --> 14:13.985
<i> I'm</i> her mother.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.486
And you didn't know anything
about where she came from?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.488
We didn't even know
that she had a sibling.

14:17.490 --> 14:19.090
How did you recognize Maggie?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.491
We wanted to
be prepared

14:20.493 --> 14:22.460
in case Riley
asked questions.

14:22.462 --> 14:25.029
We were gonna tell her
when she was older.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.931
She doesn't even know
who Maggie is.

14:26.933 --> 14:28.867
She must be so scared.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.301
Do you know
what Maggie went to prison for?

14:32.439 --> 14:33.605
SPIKE:
Armed robbery.

14:33.607 --> 14:35.273
Maggie Perrello
was a drug addict

14:35.275 --> 14:36.441
who held up a pharmacy.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.876
She got sentenced
to eight years.

14:37.878 --> 14:39.444
And the kids were put
in foster care?

14:39.446 --> 14:40.545
Maggie was a single parent.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.880
Her husband died
the year before.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.047
When did she get out?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.566
Four months ago.

14:44.567 --> 14:46.084
She served five years
of her sentence, paroled early.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.319
Now that she's out,
she wants her kids back.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.088
Spike, see if you can track down

14:50.090 --> 14:51.556
any of Maggie's family
or friends.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.958
Anybody who might
give us some insight.
You got it.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.927
No sign of the subject.

14:55.929 --> 14:57.996
Terrace secure.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.299
MAGGIE:
It's going to be okay, girls.
RILEY: Let me go!

15:01.301 --> 15:03.401
We just have to find
a way out of here.
Let me go!

15:03.403 --> 15:05.136
Riley,

15:05.138 --> 15:06.304
stop!

15:06.306 --> 15:08.006
Stop.

15:08.008 --> 15:09.474
It's okay.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.042
You don't have to be afraid.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.144
I would never do anything
to hurt you.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.312
I love you.

15:14.314 --> 15:15.446
I don't even know you.

15:15.448 --> 15:17.148
Don't you remember me?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.083
No!

15:19.085 --> 15:20.051
I'm your mother.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.252
Look, I promise,

15:21.254 --> 15:23.154
I'll explain everything later.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.056
Right now,
we just need to get out of here.

15:25.058 --> 15:27.191
(Riley grunting)

15:30.430 --> 15:33.064
(panting)

15:34.000 --> 15:37.669
RILEY: Let me go!
Let go of me!

15:37.671 --> 15:39.337
Just spotted the kidnapper
with the two girls.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.605
They're leaving
the exhibit hall.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.174
Security got a visual
on Maggie and the kids.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.109
PARKER:
Where?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.178
They're heading toward
the loading dock.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.316
Tell him to stand down
and wait for backup.

15:51.318 --> 15:53.251
Subject is armed and
emotionally agitated.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.519
Sam?

15:54.521 --> 15:57.188
Heading there now.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.990
Come on. Come on, hurry!

15:58.992 --> 16:00.024
Oh.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.427
Oh, damn it!

16:02.429 --> 16:04.495
How do we get out of here?

16:05.565 --> 16:07.532
Hurry.

16:07.534 --> 16:08.700
SECURITY GUARD:
Stay where you are!

16:08.702 --> 16:10.268
Leave us alone!

16:10.270 --> 16:12.270
Come on, lady,
let the children go.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.272
I can't do that!
Take it easy.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.474
Take it easy, okay?
You're scaring the kids, okay?
(girls crying)

16:16.476 --> 16:18.509
I can't let you leave
here with the kids.
(girls screaming)

16:18.511 --> 16:21.379
Stay back!
(man groans, girls scream)

16:21.381 --> 16:24.082
(man groans, girls cry)
Oh, my God.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.283
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.551
The car's this way.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.119
Subject is escalating.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.420
She stabbed a guard in the leg.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.022
Where's Maggie now?

16:31.024 --> 16:32.323
Guard saw her exit the building.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.560
No visual on the subject.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.096
Maintain the perimeter.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.231
(crying)
Where are you taking us?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.233
Everything's gonna be okay,
I promise.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.534
Stay down!

16:43.536 --> 16:45.103
(panting)

16:57.183 --> 16:59.217
(tires squealing)

17:10.030 --> 17:11.362
Uniform only got
a partial plate.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.563
PARKER:
Spike, DMV records?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.165
No car registered
to Maggie Perrello.

17:14.167 --> 17:16.134
Could be a rental.
Or she stole it.

17:16.136 --> 17:18.136
Well, at any rate,
we got to believe

17:18.138 --> 17:19.670
that her goal is to get
those kids out of town.

17:19.672 --> 17:22.340
Spike, get the make
and model out over the wire.

17:22.342 --> 17:24.342
Copy.
Sam, get a hold of
airport security.

17:24.344 --> 17:26.277
Have them be on the
lookout for her.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.212
(engines starting)
You got it.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.747
(door opens)

17:29.749 --> 17:32.683
Hey, boss, this is
Dana Dubay, Maggie's friend.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.285
PARKER:
Hi. Thanks for coming down.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.220
Are Maggie and the kids okay?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.705
We're still
looking for them.

17:37.706 --> 17:39.189
I can't believe she would
do something like this.

17:39.192 --> 17:40.158
How long have you known her?

17:40.160 --> 17:42.260
Almost nine years.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.295
We met at Lamaze.
When's the last time
you saw her?

17:44.297 --> 17:45.763
Right before she went to prison.

17:45.765 --> 17:48.366
Maggie was hoping
I could take her kids,

17:48.368 --> 17:49.634
but I got three
of my own.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.202
One has special needs.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.438
She didn't have any family
that could take care of them?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.173
Her parents are
in a nursing home,

17:55.175 --> 17:58.076
and Josh's folks passed
away a few years ago.

17:58.078 --> 18:00.111
And Josh was her husband?

18:00.113 --> 18:01.779
How did he die?
A car accident.

18:01.781 --> 18:03.748
Maggie and Riley
were in the car, too.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.250
Maggie was seven months pregnant
with Becky.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.252
Were they injured?
Riley was okay.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.254
Maggie had to have
an emergency C-section.

18:10.256 --> 18:13.191
Her pelvis was shattered.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.127
After the accident, her
whole life just fell apart.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.228
She lost Josh,
the house.

18:17.230 --> 18:19.230
It's a lot to deal with.

18:19.232 --> 18:22.333
Maggie was in so much pain,
physically, emotionally.

18:22.335 --> 18:24.268
She couldn't function
without the pills.

18:24.270 --> 18:26.204
And when the doctors
stopped giving her the drugs,

18:26.206 --> 18:27.772
she robbed the pharmacy.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.339
All she could think about
was getting those pills.

18:29.342 --> 18:32.410
Boss, Maggie Perrello
rented a car three days ago.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.679
I got her address
from her credit card.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.314
528 Brynvalley Road.

18:40.186 --> 18:41.319
Police!
Police!

18:41.321 --> 18:42.820
Police. Freeze.
Let's see some hands.

18:42.822 --> 18:44.822
Let's see
some hands.

18:52.332 --> 18:54.332
Definitely planning
to bring them here.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.867
JULES:
Look at all this stuff.

18:55.869 --> 18:57.835
She really went
all out, huh?

18:57.837 --> 19:00.371
She's trying to make it nice
for her kids.

19:00.373 --> 19:02.240
Riley and Becky
aren't her kids.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.374
Not anymore.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.225
Apartment's clear.

19:21.227 --> 19:23.327
But all Maggie's clothes
are gone.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.596
She's not coming back.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.065
All right, sweep the place.

19:27.066 --> 19:28.533
Look for any sign
that Maggie may be using again.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.601
On it.

19:30.603 --> 19:32.236
Hey, I found this
in the bedroom.

19:32.238 --> 19:34.305
Think Maggie's
stalking her?

19:36.409 --> 19:39.544
And as the prince swept
the beautiful Princess Riley

19:39.546 --> 19:44.382
off her feet, he promised
to love her forever,

19:44.384 --> 19:47.251
and to never leave wet towels
lying on the bed again.

19:47.253 --> 19:49.587
JOSH:
Funny, I don't
remember that part.

19:49.589 --> 19:52.390
MAGGIE:
Well, we changed the ending
a little bit, didn't we?

19:52.392 --> 19:53.624
JOSH:
Okay, stop kissing her.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.426
I can't see her face.

19:55.428 --> 19:59.564
Okay, say,
"I love you, Daddy."

19:59.566 --> 20:01.566
I love you, Daddy.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.267
Say hi.

20:03.269 --> 20:05.403
We love you, Daddy.

20:05.405 --> 20:06.404
JULES:
She seems

20:06.406 --> 20:07.905
so happy.

20:07.907 --> 20:09.907
It's just a shame...

20:09.909 --> 20:12.310
what drugs can do to a life.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.779
That's no excuse for
the choices she made.

20:14.781 --> 20:17.515
I thought you'd be
more sympathetic.

20:18.484 --> 20:20.518
Oh, I get it.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.453
The drunk
who lost custody of his kid.

20:22.455 --> 20:23.921
Okay, Greg,
come on.

20:23.922 --> 20:25.388
You don't see me running around
with a knife,

20:25.391 --> 20:28.693
trying to take him back
by force, do you?

20:28.695 --> 20:29.994
Maggie's been out for months.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.662
Why did she wait till now?

20:31.664 --> 20:34.498
Hmm. Let's get
her parole officer down here.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.367
Maybe he can give us
some answers.

20:36.369 --> 20:39.403
(sighs)

20:39.405 --> 20:40.404
Okay, thanks.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.473
Anything?

20:42.474 --> 20:44.541
No sign of her at the bus depot
or the train station.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.544
What about the APB?
No hits so far.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.348
Spike, we need to get a hold

20:50.350 --> 20:51.849
of Maggie's parole officer,
Grant Levy.

20:51.851 --> 20:54.452
I'll see if I can
track him down for you.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.354
Everything all right?

20:56.355 --> 20:58.255
Think I just overstepped
a little with the boss.

20:58.258 --> 20:59.974
What do you mean?

20:59.975 --> 21:01.691
He's harsh on the subject,
and I called him on it.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.361
Didn't go over well?

21:03.363 --> 21:04.829
Struck a nerve.

21:04.831 --> 21:06.530
Should have kept my mouth shut.

21:06.532 --> 21:08.499
Why start now?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.434
Thanks.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.469
No. It's good.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.437
I like that
you speak your mind.

21:13.439 --> 21:15.373
Really?

21:16.342 --> 21:17.575
Jules?

21:17.577 --> 21:19.477
Got the number for you.
Thanks, Spike.

21:31.424 --> 21:33.424
(sighs)

21:33.426 --> 21:35.059
Okay, guys, we're here.

21:36.029 --> 21:38.596
BECKY (crying):
Is that your house?

21:38.598 --> 21:40.431
MAGGIE:
Well, it used to be.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.401
When you were a little baby,
we lived here together.

21:43.403 --> 21:45.436
You remember, Riley?

21:45.438 --> 21:48.306
No.

21:48.308 --> 21:49.807
Well, you see that window
up there?

21:51.377 --> 21:53.477
That used to be
your room.

21:53.479 --> 21:57.481
It had pink and yellow
butterflies on the wall.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.618
And every night
when I used to tuck you in,

22:00.620 --> 22:03.821
you used to hide under the
covers, and I'd say

22:03.823 --> 22:05.823
"Where's Riley?"

22:05.825 --> 22:07.825
And you used to laugh,

22:07.827 --> 22:09.994
and then I would just tickle you
until you came out.

22:09.996 --> 22:13.030
Do you remember?

22:15.001 --> 22:16.400
Come on.

22:16.402 --> 22:19.337
I want to show
you something.

22:19.339 --> 22:21.038
It's okay. It'll be fun,
I promise.

22:25.545 --> 22:27.545
You see that?

22:27.547 --> 22:28.779
What is it?

22:28.781 --> 22:30.614
It's a bird feeder.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.484
When you were little,
there was a family of robins

22:33.486 --> 22:35.086
and they built a nest
right up there.

22:35.088 --> 22:37.005
And they had
two little babies.

22:37.006 --> 22:38.923
And you were worried that they
wouldn't have enough to eat,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.391
so you used to share your cereal

22:40.393 --> 22:41.625
with them.

22:41.627 --> 22:44.628
And you and I put the feeder
right up there.

22:44.630 --> 22:47.398
And we would sit
right over there.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.801
And then we would watch
the mama feed her birdies.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.570
Do you remember that?

22:52.572 --> 22:54.405
I want to go home.

22:54.407 --> 22:56.407
Me, too.

22:56.409 --> 22:57.708
I know this is

22:57.710 --> 22:59.577
really confusing for you,

22:59.579 --> 23:03.414
because you hadn't seen me
in a really, really long time.

23:03.416 --> 23:06.984
But some people, they-they
took you away from me,

23:06.986 --> 23:10.020
and now that we're together
again, we can be a family.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.555
No.

23:11.557 --> 23:12.790
I want to go home!

23:12.792 --> 23:14.959
I want my mom!

23:14.961 --> 23:16.994
MAN:
<i> This isn't drug related.</i>

23:16.996 --> 23:19.397
Maggie's been clean
for four years.

23:19.399 --> 23:21.132
She stopped using in prison?

23:21.134 --> 23:22.967
Worked real hard,
turned her life around.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.535
Until today.

23:24.537 --> 23:26.137
Kidnapping and assault
with a deadly weapon.

23:26.139 --> 23:27.605
Do you have any idea
what set her off?

23:27.607 --> 23:29.123
Well, the whole time

23:29.124 --> 23:30.640
she was in prison,
Maggie was under the impression

23:30.643 --> 23:32.710
that once she got out,
she'd get her kids back.

23:32.712 --> 23:36.514
A few days ago,
I had to break the news to her.

23:36.516 --> 23:38.516
I got a waitressing job.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.484
It only pays
ten dollars an hour,

23:40.486 --> 23:42.520
but at least it's a start.
That's great.

23:42.522 --> 23:44.021
Are you still going
to drug counseling?

23:44.023 --> 23:45.589
Four times a week.
Here,

23:45.591 --> 23:47.158
I want to show you something.

23:47.160 --> 23:49.160
I'm really excited.
(laughs)

23:49.162 --> 23:52.430
Just wait till you see this.

23:57.136 --> 23:59.136
This is for Becky and Riley.

23:59.138 --> 24:01.739
I just wanted it to be perfect
for when they come home.

24:01.741 --> 24:02.807
I'm sorry.

24:02.809 --> 24:04.642
You can't get
your kids back.

24:04.644 --> 24:06.728
What are you talking about?

24:06.729 --> 24:08.813
Becky and Riley's foster parents
legally adopted them.

24:08.815 --> 24:10.298
No.

24:10.299 --> 24:11.782
Before I went to prison,
my lawyer told me

24:11.784 --> 24:13.584
that I had a chance
to get my kids back.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.785
As long as they were
in foster care,

24:14.787 --> 24:16.520
but they've been
legally adopted.

24:16.522 --> 24:18.556
But I never gave up
my parental rights.

24:18.558 --> 24:20.491
You didn't have to.
The courts terminated them.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.493
I want my kids back.

24:22.495 --> 24:25.496
My girls, they're all I have.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.131
Please.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.967
I want my kids back.

24:29.969 --> 24:31.569
So the courts could do that?
They can just...

24:31.571 --> 24:32.770
take away her kids?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.772
Maggie was going to prison
for a long time.

24:34.774 --> 24:37.641
Social Services didn't want
the children to languish

24:37.643 --> 24:38.676
in foster care.

24:38.678 --> 24:40.578
Kids under five,
highly adoptable.

24:42.482 --> 24:46.183
Looks like she was trying
to stay in touch
with the girls.

24:46.185 --> 24:47.818
Social Services didn't
pass the letters on.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.687
They felt it was best
for the children

24:49.689 --> 24:51.489
if they just
severed all ties.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.524
So Maggie spent years
fantasizing

24:53.526 --> 24:56.694
about this happy reunion
with her children.

24:56.696 --> 24:59.630
And now that fantasy's
falling apart.

24:59.632 --> 25:00.898
Looks like.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.706
Riley, are you hungry?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.708
I made your favorite,

25:10.710 --> 25:12.910
banana chocolate chip.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.281
I have another surprise for you.

25:17.283 --> 25:20.751
You must remember him.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.753
Charlie.

25:22.755 --> 25:24.989
I got him for you
when you were three months old.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.124
What happened to his leg?

25:27.126 --> 25:30.961
Well, one day when we were
crossing the street,

25:30.963 --> 25:32.963
Charlie fell

25:32.965 --> 25:35.633
and a streetcar ran over him.

25:35.635 --> 25:38.702
And I wanted to throw him away,
but you wouldn't let me.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.706
You loved him,
even though he wasn't perfect.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.546
And when I went away,
I kept Charlie with me.

25:48.548 --> 25:51.615
And every time I looked at him,
I thought of you.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.926
Cho...?

26:01.928 --> 26:03.928
(softly sighs)

26:03.930 --> 26:05.930
Yeah.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.598
Cho!

26:07.600 --> 26:09.600
You called him Cho,

26:09.602 --> 26:11.168
because you couldn't
say Charlie.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.771
(Becky coughing)
MAGGIE: Becky? Becky?

26:13.773 --> 26:15.005
(Becky wheezing)
Are you okay?

26:15.007 --> 26:17.274
(coughing)
Do you want
some juice?

26:17.276 --> 26:19.343
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.

26:19.345 --> 26:21.011
(coughing)
Sweetheart, are you okay?

26:21.013 --> 26:23.714
(coughing and gasping)
Can you do something?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.783
Becky? Oh, my God.
Becky?

26:36.729 --> 26:39.830
(Becky coughing and wheezing)

26:43.269 --> 26:45.102
MAGGIE:
Someone, please!

26:45.104 --> 26:47.104
Please, help my daughter!

26:47.106 --> 26:48.973
(Becky coughing)

26:48.975 --> 26:50.841
Oh, what's wrong with her?

26:50.843 --> 26:52.076
(coughing and wheezing)

26:52.078 --> 26:53.377
I don't know.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.812
She won't stop coughing,

26:54.814 --> 26:56.113
and she's having
trouble breathing.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.382
Okay, I'll call 911.
No! No! No!

26:58.384 --> 26:59.750
Just help her.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.318
I'm not a doctor, I can't...

27:01.319 --> 27:02.885
Give her something
to help her breathe!

27:02.888 --> 27:03.921
Has she had bronchitis

27:03.923 --> 27:05.289
or the flu or recently?

27:05.291 --> 27:07.358
(crying):
I don't know.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.326
(gasping and wheezing)

27:10.262 --> 27:11.929
We'll call an ambulance, okay.

27:11.931 --> 27:13.163
No!

27:13.165 --> 27:15.299
Just help her!

27:15.301 --> 27:17.234
Please...

27:17.236 --> 27:19.236
Just get that girl
to lock up the doors

27:19.238 --> 27:20.337
and get over here.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.306
Madelaine, can you...

27:22.308 --> 27:24.308
can you lock up
and come here please?

27:24.310 --> 27:25.376
MADELAINE:
Is everything okay?

27:25.378 --> 27:26.644
Just do it.

27:26.646 --> 27:29.647
(Becky wheezing)

27:30.783 --> 27:33.050
(gasps)
Oh!

27:33.052 --> 27:34.284
Just sit down.

27:34.286 --> 27:36.887
Help her!

27:36.889 --> 27:39.223
Do you know if she has asthma?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.424
I don't know.

27:40.426 --> 27:42.426
She was born premature,

27:42.428 --> 27:45.195
and her lungs
were underdeveloped.

27:45.197 --> 27:47.197
How-how long
has she been coughing?

27:47.199 --> 27:48.198
Not long.

27:48.200 --> 27:49.867
Just a few minutes.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.268
I-I got her some juice,

27:51.270 --> 27:52.670
but it didn't help.

27:52.672 --> 27:55.739
PHARMACIST:
Is she on any medication?

27:55.741 --> 27:57.274
(crying):
I don't know.

27:57.276 --> 27:58.308
What about vitamins?

27:58.310 --> 28:00.377
MAGGIE: I don't know!
Okay.

28:00.379 --> 28:01.178
I can, um...

28:01.180 --> 28:03.180
I could try a nebulizer.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.215
Uh, that could help
open her airway.

28:05.217 --> 28:07.985
Just hurry!
(under breath): Okay.

28:07.987 --> 28:11.155
Boss, 911 just got a call from a
little girl identifying herself

28:11.157 --> 28:13.223
as Riley Adler.
Patch her through.

28:14.160 --> 28:16.060
Riley?

28:16.062 --> 28:18.195
Hi, sweetheart.
I'm Greg Parker.

28:18.197 --> 28:20.397
I'm a police officer.
Are you okay?

28:20.399 --> 28:21.965
I'm scared.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.000
You were really brave

28:23.002 --> 28:24.802
calling 911.

28:24.804 --> 28:26.270
Can you tell me
where you are?

28:26.272 --> 28:28.105
We're in the drugstore.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.306
The lady who took you,

28:29.308 --> 28:31.241
where is she right now?

28:31.243 --> 28:33.243
She's trying to help Becky.

28:33.245 --> 28:34.411
What's wrong with Becky?

28:34.413 --> 28:36.447
Is she hurt?
She's really sick.

28:36.449 --> 28:38.248
Okay. You don't worry.

28:38.250 --> 28:39.383
We're gonna help her, okay?

28:39.385 --> 28:40.684
What about you, though?

28:40.685 --> 28:41.984
Are you okay?
(footsteps approaching)

28:41.987 --> 28:43.087
Riley!

28:43.089 --> 28:45.089
No.

28:45.091 --> 28:47.291
What are you doing?
(phone beeps)

28:47.293 --> 28:48.959
Riley?

28:48.961 --> 28:50.160
WINNIE:
I got an address.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.063
Civic Drugs.
1598 Victoria Street.

28:53.065 --> 28:54.782
Okay, we're on our way.

28:54.783 --> 28:56.500
Winnie, get an ambulance
on standby.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.736
Copy that.

28:58.738 --> 29:00.370
Please be okay.

29:05.111 --> 29:06.944
Is it working?

29:06.946 --> 29:08.212
Is she getting any better?

29:08.214 --> 29:09.246
I'm not sure.

29:09.248 --> 29:10.380
It's hard to tell.

29:10.382 --> 29:12.483
We have to get out of here
right away!

29:12.485 --> 29:14.885
(distant sirens wailing)

29:14.887 --> 29:16.854
Oh, my God.

29:16.856 --> 29:18.922
(sirens wailing)

29:28.334 --> 29:30.100
Sam, I need eyes in.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.401
Bone camera?
Let's do it.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.936
Bone cam.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.505
Wordy, set up a perimeter.

29:34.507 --> 29:37.307
WORDY:
Ed, if there's any chance
that little girl's hurt...

29:37.309 --> 29:39.693
We can't risk it.

29:39.694 --> 29:42.078
Last time Maggie was cornered,
she stabbed a security guard.

29:42.081 --> 29:44.515
PARKER:
No answer. We got eyes yet?

29:44.517 --> 29:46.784
We're working on it, boss.

30:14.113 --> 30:15.112
(door opens)

30:15.114 --> 30:17.114
We got eyes.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.483
(door closes)

30:22.488 --> 30:24.855
PARKER:
Eddie, it looks like
we've got two other hostages.

30:24.857 --> 30:27.090
And they appear to be unharmed.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.358
ED:
How's Becky doing?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.327
Doesn't look so good.

30:30.329 --> 30:32.896
Huh. The pharmacist seems to
have her hooked up to something.

30:32.898 --> 30:34.131
Oxygen maybe?

30:34.133 --> 30:35.332
It's hard to tell.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.567
(door opens)
I got to talk to Maggie.

30:36.569 --> 30:39.269
Find out what's going on.

30:42.308 --> 30:43.808
(door closes)

30:43.809 --> 30:45.309
PARKER (over bullhorn):
Maggie Perrello,

30:45.311 --> 30:49.179
this is Sergeant Parker with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

30:49.181 --> 30:52.182
I will be calling you
inside the pharmacy,

30:52.184 --> 30:55.052
and I need you to pick up
the phone.

30:59.024 --> 31:01.458
(sighs)

31:01.460 --> 31:03.393
(phone ringing)

31:03.395 --> 31:05.596
He wants to talk to you.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.270
MAGGIE:
Hello.

31:13.272 --> 31:14.772
Hi, Maggie.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.273
Thank you
for picking up the phone.

31:16.275 --> 31:18.542
I just wanted to know
if everyone was okay in there.

31:18.544 --> 31:20.611
Not exactly.

31:20.613 --> 31:22.379
Riley said Becky was sick.

31:22.381 --> 31:24.248
She's having trouble breathing.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.482
I don't know
what's wrong with her.

31:25.484 --> 31:27.451
Get Jenna Corday on the phone.

31:27.453 --> 31:29.019
Becky have any underlying
medical conditions?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.220
(whispering):
Got it.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.455
Hey, Maggie,
there's an ambulance right here.

31:31.457 --> 31:32.489
If you bring Becky out,

31:32.491 --> 31:34.424
we can take her to the hospital.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.927
I'm not going to let you
take her away from me.

31:36.929 --> 31:38.262
Okay.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.364
Okay, uh, well, then,
how about you let

31:40.366 --> 31:42.299
the paramedic come inside,
check Becky,

31:42.301 --> 31:44.568
make sure she's okay?

31:44.570 --> 31:47.204
Come on, Maggie,
I know you love your daughter.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.406
You don't want anything
to happen to her.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.475
PHARMACIST:
This isn't helping.
Becky?!

31:51.477 --> 31:52.943
She's getting worse.

31:52.945 --> 31:53.944
Becky?!

31:53.946 --> 31:56.546
Becky!

32:06.025 --> 32:08.125
Greg, this is going
downhill fast.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.293
We got to get in there.

32:09.295 --> 32:10.961
MAGGIE:
Becky!

32:10.963 --> 32:12.629
She's still not breathing!

32:12.631 --> 32:15.065
Come on, Maggie,
let us help Becky.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.333
Let the paramedic in there.

32:17.303 --> 32:19.569
Okay, please just help her.

32:19.571 --> 32:22.406
Thank you, we'll be right there.

32:22.408 --> 32:23.407
(door opens)

32:23.409 --> 32:25.943
Go unlock the door.

32:25.945 --> 32:29.112
PHARMACIST:
Madelaine, could you?

32:29.114 --> 32:30.347
She's unstable and she's armed.

32:30.349 --> 32:32.015
You're going to need backup.

32:32.017 --> 32:34.084
PARKER:
Okay, ready?

32:36.722 --> 32:38.722
Maggie, we're sending the
paramedic over there right now.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.691
Just help her, please.

32:42.294 --> 32:44.061
Hurry!

32:50.736 --> 32:52.970
PARAMEDIC:
How long has she
been unconscious?

32:52.972 --> 32:54.972
MAGGIE:
Just a couple minutes.

32:54.974 --> 32:58.008
She has a pulse, but there
are no breath sounds.

32:58.010 --> 33:00.043
(sobs)

33:00.045 --> 33:02.145
JULES:
Boss, I just got off the phone
with Jenna Corday.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.246
The only medical condition Becky
has is an allergy to almonds.

33:04.249 --> 33:06.383
Even trace amounts
and her throat will close.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.218
Her throat
is swollen shut.
Almonds-- you
give her anything

33:08.220 --> 33:09.353
with almonds?

33:09.355 --> 33:13.156
Uh... oh, I put some
in the muffins.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.624
She's having
an allergic reaction.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.994
This shot of epinephrine
will take the swelling down

33:16.996 --> 33:19.029
so she can breathe.

33:19.031 --> 33:21.365
MAGGIE:
I'm so sorry.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.533
It's okay, you did good
by letting us help her.

33:27.306 --> 33:28.372
She's responsive.

33:28.374 --> 33:30.107
BP's getting stronger.

33:30.109 --> 33:32.542
And the swelling
is coming down.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.713
Oh, thank God.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.081
We still need to take
her to the hospital

33:38.083 --> 33:39.549
and check her out.

33:39.551 --> 33:41.084
I can take care of her.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.486
No, you need to let them go--
her and Riley.

33:42.488 --> 33:43.587
I just
got them back.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.555
I'm not going
to lose them again.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.807
No, you never got them back.

33:46.808 --> 33:48.058
You took them
from their families.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.626
I'm their family!
Not anymore.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.261
You lost that chance

33:51.263 --> 33:52.796
with the choices you made.

33:52.798 --> 33:54.131
I'm a different person now.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.432
See, you're
still thinking

33:55.434 --> 33:58.168
about what you want,
not what's best for them.

33:58.170 --> 33:59.169
Greg,

33:59.171 --> 34:01.304
easy, easy.

34:05.644 --> 34:08.211
I know what it's like
to lose your kids.

34:10.215 --> 34:13.550
To not be a part of their lives.

34:13.552 --> 34:16.653
I haven't been allowed
to see my son for ten years.

34:17.623 --> 34:20.057
And the hardest part

34:20.059 --> 34:22.826
is to accept the fact that
they're doing okay without you.

34:22.828 --> 34:23.827
MAGGIE:
That's not true.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.796
Oh...

34:25.798 --> 34:27.697
No, we have trouble
believing it, don't we?

34:27.699 --> 34:29.332
That woman
at the school today--

34:29.334 --> 34:32.069
she made Becky cry

34:32.071 --> 34:33.503
and then she just
left her sitting there.

34:33.505 --> 34:35.505
I understand,
I heard that.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.507
Jenna was just
yelling at Becky

34:37.509 --> 34:39.676
because she was running around
the playground really fast.

34:39.678 --> 34:42.345
She just wanted her to
slow down and be safe.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.549
You're wrong.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.583
No.

34:46.585 --> 34:49.419
No, we see what we want to see.

34:50.756 --> 34:52.622
You convince yourself that
your kids are being mistreated

34:52.624 --> 34:54.591
so you can rescue them.

34:54.593 --> 34:57.160
It's not true.

34:57.162 --> 35:00.130
It's not true.

35:00.132 --> 35:03.333
You see...
Becky and her adoptive mom--

35:03.335 --> 35:06.470
they play pretend every day,
they dress up like princesses,

35:06.472 --> 35:10.207
and her father--
he's the dragon.

35:10.209 --> 35:12.476
And, uh...

35:12.477 --> 35:14.744
and the Adlers tell me
that Riley is learning

35:14.746 --> 35:16.179
how to skate, huh?

35:16.181 --> 35:19.032
So every weekend

35:19.033 --> 35:21.884
they go down to the rink
together and they practice.

35:21.887 --> 35:24.588
Maggie...

35:24.590 --> 35:27.124
your kids are with families
who love them.

35:28.894 --> 35:32.529
I miss them so much.

35:32.531 --> 35:34.664
I know you do.

35:34.666 --> 35:36.666
Ever since I got out,

35:36.668 --> 35:40.270
I watch them every day.

35:40.272 --> 35:42.472
You have no idea
what it feels like to be

35:42.474 --> 35:47.344
so close to your children
and you can't hold them.

35:49.281 --> 35:51.481
(crying)

35:51.483 --> 35:55.152
I just wanted
to start over.

35:55.154 --> 35:57.254
Yeah.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.422
A second chance at being
a good mother, I know.

35:59.424 --> 36:01.291
It's not exactly
how you imagined it, is it?

36:01.293 --> 36:03.460
I'm sorry.

36:03.462 --> 36:06.163
But this could be that chance.

36:06.165 --> 36:08.632
This is a chance.

36:08.634 --> 36:10.934
You can do what's
best for them.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.469
You can show
them how much

36:12.471 --> 36:14.337
you love them.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.273
(sighs)

36:16.275 --> 36:19.309
You can let them go.

36:22.881 --> 36:25.415
You're really my mother?

36:28.620 --> 36:31.421
(Maggie sighs, sniffs)

36:32.391 --> 36:35.559
I love you guys so much.

36:35.561 --> 36:37.627
You remember that, okay?

36:47.406 --> 36:48.972
Riley, it's okay,
you can come here.

36:48.974 --> 36:51.474
(Maggie sobs)

36:52.411 --> 36:54.744
Maggie, thank you.

36:54.746 --> 36:57.347
(screaming sobs)

37:01.653 --> 37:05.388
(crying)

37:19.004 --> 37:21.271
(guitar plays gentle intro)

37:35.287 --> 37:39.956
¶ Underneath the cherry tree ¶

37:39.958 --> 37:44.294
¶ I was calling out to be ¶

37:44.296 --> 37:51.568
¶ Didn't know
where I would run anymore ¶

37:52.904 --> 37:57.374
¶ I had nowhere left to turn ¶

37:57.376 --> 38:01.778
¶ Wondering where it was
I'd been ¶

38:01.780 --> 38:05.815
¶ Everyone here like a gift ¶

38:05.817 --> 38:11.621
¶ When you came to be ¶

38:14.493 --> 38:16.559
¶ ¶

38:16.561 --> 38:24.301
¶ You can save my life
and I'll save yours ¶

38:24.303 --> 38:28.038
¶ Save my life
and I'll save yours ¶

38:28.040 --> 38:34.978
¶ Save my life and
I'll save yours ¶

38:34.980 --> 38:41.017
¶ Save my life
and I'll save yours ¶

38:41.019 --> 38:45.388
¶ Save my life and
I'll save yours ¶

38:45.390 --> 38:51.861
¶ Save my life
and I'll save yours... ¶

38:51.863 --> 38:54.397
You all right?

38:54.399 --> 38:57.067
The Adlers offered to send
Maggie updates on Riley--

38:57.069 --> 38:58.468
you know, letters and photos.

38:58.470 --> 39:00.403
Well, that's nice of 'em.

39:00.405 --> 39:01.404
Mm-hmm, yeah.

39:01.406 --> 39:02.739
And when she turns 18,

39:02.741 --> 39:04.374
if she wants a relationship
with her mother,

39:04.376 --> 39:06.009
they're not going
to stand in her way.

39:06.011 --> 39:08.945
So Maggie gets a second chance.

39:08.947 --> 39:11.681
So could you.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.416
Ten years, Eddie, ten years
of sitting on the sidelines,

39:14.419 --> 39:17.854
waiting for my ex to notice
that I am not who I was.

39:17.856 --> 39:22.826
Ten years of birthdays,
and report cards, lost teeth.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.627
(quavering):
Broken arms.

39:24.629 --> 39:26.830
Ten years.

39:26.832 --> 39:28.798
I've hugged a hundred kids
in the last ten years,

39:28.800 --> 39:31.501
and I still don't know what it
feels like to hug my own boy.

39:33.138 --> 39:35.839
So why don't you go
down there, take a ram,

39:35.841 --> 39:37.941
and bust open a
couple doors, huh?

39:37.943 --> 39:39.976
(quietly):
Yeah.

39:39.978 --> 39:42.712
Or maybe you
get a lawyer.

39:44.649 --> 39:46.649
You're a good man,
Greg Parker,

39:46.651 --> 39:49.486
and your son deserves
to know that.

39:49.488 --> 39:51.888
Second chances, right?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.423
It's that simple.

39:55.427 --> 39:56.960
You're right.

39:58.730 --> 40:00.730
(sighs)

40:00.732 --> 40:01.998
SAM:
Hey, Jules.

40:02.000 --> 40:03.466
JULES:
Hi.

40:03.467 --> 40:04.933
Things with you
and the boss okay?

40:04.936 --> 40:07.704
Yeah, yeah,
they're all good.

40:07.706 --> 40:10.039
So, you got big
plans tonight?

40:10.041 --> 40:14.077
Yeah, huge-- going grocery
shopping, doing some laundry.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.445
Exciting.
(laughs)

40:15.447 --> 40:16.679
What about you?

40:16.681 --> 40:18.748
I don't know, I was
just gonna grab a beer

40:18.750 --> 40:20.817
and watch the game.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.853
Hey, thanks for before--

40:23.855 --> 40:26.489
you know, um,
speaking my mind.

40:26.491 --> 40:28.925
Yeah, well, people
should, right?

40:29.895 --> 40:32.429
Have fun watching
your game.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.834
See you tomorrow.

40:37.836 --> 40:44.007
¶ Save my life
and I'll save yours ¶

40:44.009 --> 40:47.577
¶ Save my life and
I'll save yours ¶

40:47.579 --> 40:49.212
¶ Save my life
and I'll save yours... ¶
