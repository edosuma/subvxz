00:06.333 --> 00:08.500
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:08.533 --> 00:11.067
the path to survival
is filled with danger.

00:11.100 --> 00:13.833
-GLENN:
There's one right there.
-(GUNSHOT)

00:13.867 --> 00:16.467
NARRATOR:
The Hailstones embark
on a treacherous journey.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.067
AGNES:
Miles in ice and tundra.

00:21.100 --> 00:23.900
NARRATOR: Andy and Kate are
trapped by the frozen Yukon.

00:23.933 --> 00:26.200
ANDY: The ice broke off, and
is just not safe right now.

00:28.133 --> 00:31.100
NARRATOR: And a mountain of
snow threatens to bury Sue.

00:31.133 --> 00:32.833
SUE: That thing can
cave any minute.

00:33.767 --> 00:34.933
Ah!

00:49.000 --> 00:50.167
(WOLF HOWLING)

00:51.967 --> 00:53.433
GLENN: I just woke up,

00:53.467 --> 00:56.067
and I heard wolves howling
off in the distance.

00:58.300 --> 01:00.467
I'm gonna go outside
and see what's going on.

01:03.367 --> 01:05.233
I'm not hunting
for a particular animal

01:05.267 --> 01:06.633
most of the time
when I go out.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.833
All I do is take advantage
of opportunities that come up.

01:09.867 --> 01:11.200
(HOWLING CONTINUES)

01:12.100 --> 01:13.300
(SOFTLY) There's a wolf.

01:13.333 --> 01:16.933
At least one wolf not very far
from here at all right now.

01:16.967 --> 01:18.833
If I howl,
and the wolves are out,

01:18.867 --> 01:20.167
they'll howl back to me.

01:20.767 --> 01:22.367
(HOWLING)

01:28.000 --> 01:29.167
(WOLF HOWLING)

01:29.200 --> 01:32.867
I just heard the wolf howl
just a couple 100 yards away.

01:32.900 --> 01:35.300
I've got a trail that goes up
that direction.

01:35.333 --> 01:37.067
He might be walking
on my trail.

01:38.000 --> 01:39.167
(GROWLING)

01:40.100 --> 01:41.633
I feel a kinship
with the wolves.

01:41.667 --> 01:43.033
The wolves are out here
hunting to get food.

01:43.067 --> 01:44.900
I'm out here hunting
to get food,

01:44.933 --> 01:46.067
and the wolves are living

01:46.100 --> 01:47.167
pretty basic existence.

01:47.200 --> 01:48.633
I'm living a pretty
basic existence.

01:48.667 --> 01:50.133
So I do feel close to them.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.967
-(HOWLING)
-We're not really friends.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.433
We're not buddies,
but we're not enemies either.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.367
Seven years ago,

01:58.400 --> 02:02.600
I come across
this track of a caribou
that had been wounded.

02:02.633 --> 02:04.400
One wolf chasing it.

02:07.333 --> 02:10.067
So immediately I take off
following this caribou

02:10.100 --> 02:11.533
and this wolf up the mountain.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.533
We head in a direction
where it's headed

02:17.567 --> 02:19.100
right towards some cliffs,

02:19.133 --> 02:21.533
and the tracks go right over
the top of the cliff.

02:21.567 --> 02:23.700
The caribou got chased
right off of this cliff

02:23.733 --> 02:25.533
down into this deep ravine.

02:27.000 --> 02:28.433
And I get down
into that ravine,

02:28.467 --> 02:31.167
I find the caribou, I start
butchering the caribou.

02:31.200 --> 02:33.867
Decided to make a backpack
out of its rib cage,

02:33.900 --> 02:37.033
and I was stuffing the legs
in there, and the head,

02:37.067 --> 02:38.567
as much as I could fit,

02:38.600 --> 02:40.367
everything went inside
the rib cage.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.133
And lugging it down out
of that ravine

02:42.167 --> 02:44.367
it was all brush
and deep snow...

02:45.900 --> 02:47.967
(CHUCKLES) But I had
that meat,

02:48.733 --> 02:50.067
and that was really something.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.800
That was one of the most
memorable days

02:52.833 --> 02:53.933
of my life I would say.

02:56.033 --> 02:58.867
Here's something.
This is a moose track.

03:00.233 --> 03:03.833
A moose crossed
this trail very recently.

03:03.867 --> 03:07.000
So the wolves also could
be after the moose.

03:07.033 --> 03:08.833
They hunt moose and caribou.

03:08.867 --> 03:11.300
They're all excited
about the trail here.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.033
Running up and down my trail,

03:14.067 --> 03:15.767
turned around
right here, stopped.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.067
It didn't keep going.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.733
This moose chose
to follow my trail

03:21.767 --> 03:23.267
'cause it was easier walking.

03:28.800 --> 03:30.200
Something urinated over there,

03:30.233 --> 03:32.667
and there's some scat in the
snow I'm gonna take a peek at.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.933
This is where a moose
was bedded down.

03:37.967 --> 03:39.133
It was laying right here.

03:43.133 --> 03:44.567
That's moose scat.

03:44.600 --> 03:46.133
In the winter
that's what it looks like.

03:50.267 --> 03:52.033
This is a wolf track
right here.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.433
Look here.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.300
That's where the wolves
crossed the trail right here.

03:57.333 --> 03:59.300
Look, they urinated right here
in the snow.

03:59.800 --> 04:01.233
(SNIFFS)

04:01.267 --> 04:03.267
You can smell that wolf urine.

04:03.667 --> 04:04.733
(SNIFFS)

04:06.233 --> 04:08.267
Wolf just peed there
this morning.

04:09.367 --> 04:10.800
Look at this.

04:10.833 --> 04:14.533
This wolf is walking right
in this moose's tracks.

04:14.567 --> 04:15.967
It's following
the moose tracks.

04:17.833 --> 04:20.467
SUE: If you want
to test yourself,

04:20.500 --> 04:21.933
no matter
what your personality,

04:21.967 --> 04:24.700
you can certainly find an area
of Alaska that will do it.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.600
You never know up here from
one minute to the next
what you're gonna do.

04:47.200 --> 04:51.167
NARRATOR: Years in the bush
have taught Sue Aikens
to tackle problems head on.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.233
SUE: All right. This is my
freezer room.

04:56.267 --> 04:57.833
This is where
I keep all my food,

04:57.867 --> 05:01.567
and this is 17, 18 foot
of drift in front of it.

05:01.600 --> 05:04.200
I have a storm system
that's coming in.

05:06.967 --> 05:10.300
I've got several low fronts,
a few high fronts.

05:10.333 --> 05:12.567
It's all coming together,
it's colliding,

05:12.600 --> 05:14.400
and it's a recipe
for disaster.

05:20.267 --> 05:22.400
It's supposed
to be 70 below tonight
and the next few days

05:22.433 --> 05:24.067
while this storm comes in.

05:24.100 --> 05:25.133
Brings moisture.

05:25.167 --> 05:27.467
Moisture at those
temperatures is snow.

05:27.500 --> 05:30.800
The wind with it, it's gonna
crush my building.

05:30.833 --> 05:32.867
It's gonna be deeper
than my lines.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.233
So what I've gotta do is take
a little weight off this line

05:35.267 --> 05:37.067
so it's not drooping so much.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.500
While I have a 17-foot drift
and I can reach this,

05:39.533 --> 05:41.567
this is normally 22 foot
in the air.

05:43.633 --> 05:45.767
I've got my entire business,

05:45.800 --> 05:50.000
a $20,000 building
with $8,000 in supplies.

05:50.033 --> 05:52.800
So I've gotta get
on my snow removal.

05:58.433 --> 06:00.567
As the sun is getting ready
to go down,

06:00.600 --> 06:02.700
you can feel
that temperature change.

06:05.467 --> 06:07.567
I'm gonna be working into the
night to get this shit done.

06:14.067 --> 06:16.733
I'm just beginning
to move that snow.

06:16.767 --> 06:20.433
It's not just that
big 17-foot mound.

06:20.467 --> 06:21.700
I've gotta move
the other stuff

06:21.733 --> 06:23.100
that's been building up too.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.067
I started to make
my little flat path

06:30.100 --> 06:31.600
out to where
I need to dump it.

06:36.133 --> 06:37.333
When you're doing
snow removal,

06:37.367 --> 06:39.167
I can't just go and
fling it over my shoulder

06:39.200 --> 06:41.400
because in a couple of months,
it's gonna melt.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.967
It's gotta melt away
from the camp,
not flood the camp.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.833
I have to move it
far enough away,
that's not my issue.

06:53.133 --> 06:56.933
It's not what's out here today
that's gonna nail me
in the booty.

06:56.967 --> 06:58.967
It's what might
happen tomorrow.

06:59.000 --> 07:00.967
You gotta move
as much as you can,

07:01.000 --> 07:03.367
so you have as much time
before you do it again.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.033
Every storm that
comes through,

07:08.067 --> 07:09.800
it doesn't even have to carry
snow with it,

07:12.733 --> 07:14.500
because here
there's nothing to stop it.

07:16.167 --> 07:17.533
The wind comes
barrelling through,

07:17.567 --> 07:20.467
blows it until it hits
the first thing
taller than ground.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.733
My little paws
are getting cold.

07:26.667 --> 07:28.733
The temperature
is definitely dropping.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.200
The sun is down,
the moon is out.

07:34.233 --> 07:35.967
So I'm gonna be working this
through the dark.

07:36.000 --> 07:38.400
I gotta protect all of,
you know, my little fingers.

07:39.467 --> 07:41.367
Warm up.

07:41.400 --> 07:43.300
Opposable thumbs are only good
if you have them.

07:46.367 --> 07:50.100
ANDY: I go by my, uh,
rule of P's I call it.

07:50.133 --> 07:52.600
Proper planning prevents
piss-poor performance.

07:52.633 --> 07:54.100
The five P's.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.633
Oh, my God.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.633
God damn it.

08:17.400 --> 08:20.233
A huge piece of ice like
several stadiums.

08:20.267 --> 08:22.567
It looked like that kind
of a size,

08:22.600 --> 08:24.200
has broken away from the shore

08:24.233 --> 08:25.933
where our trail
goes right through.

08:31.133 --> 08:33.967
NARRATOR: Breaking
river ice could destroy
Andy and Kate's path

08:34.000 --> 08:35.933
to their nearest point
of civilisation

08:35.967 --> 08:37.033
for weeks to come.

08:40.033 --> 08:41.667
ANDY: Wow, that sucks.

08:41.700 --> 08:44.167
KATE: Oh, my.
We didn't even hear that?

08:44.200 --> 08:45.333
ANDY: Holy mackerel.

08:45.367 --> 08:47.133
KATE: Oh, God,
can it get any worse?

08:50.100 --> 08:52.400
ANDY: This has been
an unusual winter.

08:52.433 --> 08:53.833
Climate change
is really affecting

08:53.867 --> 08:55.333
the way we live out here.

08:57.767 --> 08:59.633
All the seasons
are shifting later,

08:59.667 --> 09:01.233
and there's not much
we can do about it

09:01.267 --> 09:02.600
except for adapt to it

09:02.633 --> 09:06.200
and change the timing
of the way we do things.

09:06.233 --> 09:08.567
It looks like this whole big
piece just went out,

09:08.600 --> 09:10.633
fanned out like this and
then jammed up there.

09:10.667 --> 09:11.967
KATE: Yup.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.967
-It looks like it's open water
up by the island.
-KATE: Yup.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.833
So all we have is that sloped
ice now to get up river on.

09:18.567 --> 09:19.900
I have quite a bit
up in Eagle

09:19.933 --> 09:21.867
that needs to
get freighted down.

09:21.900 --> 09:24.567
If I don't get that down,
a lot of my
springtime projects

09:24.600 --> 09:27.300
are not going
to be able to happen.

09:27.333 --> 09:31.300
And now I've got
a major ice floe
that has broken off

09:31.333 --> 09:33.300
and changed where my trail

09:33.333 --> 09:34.767
that I've been using
all winter is.

09:36.667 --> 09:38.200
I'm going to go
get my ice chisel

09:38.233 --> 09:40.700
and just go check out
this area here

09:40.733 --> 09:43.167
to see whether I'm going to be
able to get up on that or not,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.400
just checking out some
of these places around here

09:45.433 --> 09:46.833
so I know what I'm up against.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.900
KATE: I think you're a fool
for going out there.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.333
I really do.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.833
ANDY: You got to be pretty
vigilant all the time

10:07.867 --> 10:09.333
when you're out on this ice.

10:09.367 --> 10:12.033
It only takes a split second
to make the wrong move

10:12.067 --> 10:13.467
or have the wrong
thing happen.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.467
Things can get
ugly really quick.

10:20.400 --> 10:22.733
It looks like the only option
is to come down here

10:22.767 --> 10:24.000
and burn some calories

10:24.033 --> 10:26.567
and try and cut a trail
out right here,

10:26.600 --> 10:28.533
flatten this out a little bit.

10:28.567 --> 10:29.700
(THUD)

10:38.567 --> 10:40.900
If it's warm temperatures,
it's going to take a long time

10:40.933 --> 10:42.267
for this to freeze up
thick enough

10:42.300 --> 10:44.233
for me to feel
comfortable on it.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.033
It would have been
a bad thing to be out

10:48.067 --> 10:50.500
on that ice
when it started moving.

10:50.533 --> 10:54.800
'Cause, uh, from
the looks of it, I would
have had open water

10:54.833 --> 10:56.933
and no way to get
to the shoreline.

11:00.633 --> 11:03.733
So my plan right now
is to head on back, uh,

11:03.767 --> 11:05.833
get a shovel,
and level out that track

11:05.867 --> 11:08.467
so that I don't go into the
water on that thin ice.

11:09.700 --> 11:11.267
I think I'll be sticking
a little closer

11:11.300 --> 11:12.800
to the bank from now on.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.600
CHIP: We have to think ahead.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.000
Folks up here for 10,000 years
have been planning ahead.

11:22.667 --> 11:23.833
You live for the day,

11:23.867 --> 11:25.600
but you gotta remember there's
gonna be a next year too.

11:42.700 --> 11:44.667
This is light winter.

11:44.700 --> 11:47.133
This is, uh, cold,
but, uh, we got long days.

11:47.167 --> 11:49.500
And this is the time of year
when we hunt female caribou.

11:50.733 --> 11:51.967
And along with
the female caribou

11:52.000 --> 11:53.267
where the caribou
are gathered up,

11:53.300 --> 11:54.333
there's usually lots of fur.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.200
I usually get quite
a few wolves.

11:56.233 --> 11:57.367
Wolverine if I can trap them.

12:01.400 --> 12:02.633
Something that we usually
don't do

12:02.667 --> 12:03.767
is leave our kids behind,

12:05.500 --> 12:07.167
but this year we're leaving
the kids behind.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.200
There's no real particular
reason to it.

12:09.233 --> 12:11.200
I guess maybe my kids wanna
do something different

12:11.233 --> 12:12.533
for their spring break,

12:12.567 --> 12:14.633
but, um, what will be
different for me and the wife

12:14.667 --> 12:16.200
is having some time
alone to ourselves.

12:17.700 --> 12:19.933

that can happen.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.100
We're going across the ocean.
There's thousands of dangers.

12:34.133 --> 12:37.900
It's gonna be miles and
miles, and we could
get lost. (CHUCKLES)

12:37.933 --> 12:40.067
But we're always
on top of the world,

12:40.100 --> 12:42.233
so we know where
we're at all the time.

12:42.267 --> 12:44.467
Since we're going so far away,
we take along a tent,

12:44.500 --> 12:46.133
and we make ourselves
a base camp.

12:48.067 --> 12:50.500
And we work out
of a base camp.

12:50.533 --> 12:51.967
Make ourselves
about a twenty mile loop,

12:53.433 --> 12:56.167
set traps, and hunt the loop.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.267
There it is!

12:59.167 --> 13:00.433
And we have what
we call our trail.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.533
And we take this trail
and this route,

13:01.567 --> 13:02.900
and we work it
for a couple weeks,

13:02.933 --> 13:05.400
and we work our traps that
have been set in between,

13:05.433 --> 13:07.233
and as we go check
the traps every day,

13:07.267 --> 13:09.300
when we see an animal off to
one side or the other,

13:09.333 --> 13:11.167
we take off after the animal
if we want it.

is to deal with it correctly

14:55.500 --> 14:56.600
or suffer the consequence.

We're not into suffering.

I'd say we got one, two,
three, four hours of light.

And look like about 15
more miles to go.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.333

through here and

15:13.367 --> 15:15.500
hopefully we don't get
stuck in this jumbled-up junk.

I never would've
survived out here.

Right there,
that's a wolf track.

16:03.333 --> 16:04.633
This is extremely fresh.

16:04.667 --> 16:06.000
These wolves were just here.

16:12.167 --> 16:16.067
I haven't seen a single
caribou track around here.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.500
Unfortunately, I saw
lots of moose sign,

16:21.533 --> 16:22.900
but no caribou sign.

16:22.933 --> 16:24.700
In winter I hunt caribou,

16:24.733 --> 16:27.967
but the legal moose season
is only in the fall.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.167
I'm gonna walk through the
forest to the southeast

16:30.200 --> 16:31.400
breaking a new trail.

16:31.433 --> 16:35.433
In that forest I may encounter
small game like grouse,

16:35.467 --> 16:38.300
porcupine, ptarmigan,
snowshoe hare.

gets so deep

16:44.567 --> 16:46.100
that you literally can't walk.

don't do very well out here.

17:15.667 --> 17:16.933
If I'm not back by tonight

17:16.967 --> 17:18.567
then it just means
that the ice broke off

17:18.600 --> 17:20.200
and I'm heading toward
the Bering Sea.

ANDY: Then we had
a large piece of
the river ice go away.

17:47.833 --> 17:49.800
It broke off, it pivoted,

17:49.833 --> 17:51.833
came down river
about a quarter mile,

17:51.867 --> 17:53.033
and jammed into the bank.

17:54.800 --> 17:57.300
So, it kind of screwed up
where I normally use

17:57.333 --> 17:59.033
for a trail to go up to Eagle.

18:00.800 --> 18:03.333
I've got some steel up in
Eagle I've gotta bring down.

18:03.367 --> 18:05.000
I've gotta haul fuel
down here,

18:05.033 --> 18:08.000

down here.

to create a path
across the unstable ice.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.367
All I'm trying to do here

18:38.400 --> 18:40.833
is create a little bit
of a trench.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.467
So if the sled
starts sliding down,

18:42.500 --> 18:45.300
it's got something to come up
against and stop right here.

18:46.967 --> 18:49.400
I definitely don't wanna be
falling off down there.

18:49.433 --> 18:53.800
So, I just create a trench
here to go through,

18:55.400 --> 18:59.067
and if I can go slow enough
I should be okay here.

19:01.500 --> 19:03.567
ANDY: I've never seen
a big piece of ice like this

19:03.600 --> 19:05.400

about going out there.

19:10.767 --> 19:13.433
I mean, I don't think
it would let go,

19:13.467 --> 19:16.200
but I didn't think this
was gonna let go either.

19:16.233 --> 19:19.667
So, the last thing I wanna do
is come down on some ice

19:19.700 --> 19:22.633
that's gonna break free
and start floating

19:22.667 --> 19:25.733
when I got
a thousand pounds
of gear behind me.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.667
It's kind of like a little
luge run right now.

19:27.700 --> 19:28.900
So as long as I'm in that,

19:28.933 --> 19:31.533
I'm not worried about sliding
out and onto that thin ice.

the building supplies

19:44.733 --> 19:46.500
needed for
his spring projects.

19:59.333 --> 20:03.167
I was trying to get this gear,
all these supplies loaded up,

20:03.200 --> 20:06.067
load some fuel, get some
propane, load that up.

20:10.567 --> 20:13.200
The biggest problem is this
metal is really slippery.

20:14.433 --> 20:15.733
It's hard to lash it down,

20:15.767 --> 20:17.667
and keep it from sliding off
the sled,

20:17.700 --> 20:19.467
so, I'm a little concerned
about that.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.000
Believe that'll keep it from
sliding out the back.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.367
Got about 800 pounds of steel
in the back sled.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.967
Probably about 600 pounds

20:35.000 --> 20:37.167
of fuel and propane
in the front sled.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.967
We'll see. Every day is
an adventure on the Yukon.

20:40.000 --> 20:41.067
I'm gonna be hauling back

20:41.100 --> 20:42.567
probably about 1000 pounds

20:42.600 --> 20:43.967
of material and fuel,

20:44.000 --> 20:46.367
so it's finding a good trail
on the way home

20:46.400 --> 20:48.033
that's gonna be
the issue today.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.500
We're running out
of good trail.

21:18.700 --> 21:20.933
With a load you don't have
a lot of control over it.

21:20.967 --> 21:22.867
It starts sloughing
back and forth

21:22.900 --> 21:25.167
and it can drag the back
of the machine around.

21:28.433 --> 21:29.967
Ah, shit.

21:30.000 --> 21:32.433
Shit, shit, shit, shit! Ah!

21:37.833 --> 21:40.100
These sleds don't like
going on side hills.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.533
They'll just
slide to the bottom,
and when they do,

21:42.567 --> 21:44.633
whatever is in the load
really shifts hard

21:44.667 --> 21:46.167
and it wants to slide out.

21:48.333 --> 21:49.933
It's time to get
rolling again.

21:52.400 --> 21:53.967
When the sleds
are running sideways

21:54.000 --> 21:55.600
after sloughing
back and forth,

21:55.633 --> 21:57.800
if they come up
and they hit a chunk of ice,

21:59.167 --> 22:01.000
it really slams the sled hard.

22:01.033 --> 22:03.700
And that's when stuff breaks.

22:03.733 --> 22:06.567
One of the last obstacles is
the side hilling

22:06.600 --> 22:08.333
right by where the new ice is.

22:08.367 --> 22:10.200
If I go off the edge
right there,

22:10.233 --> 22:12.100
I'm gonna lose 800 pounds

22:12.133 --> 22:13.900
right into a deep part
of the river.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.667
If I drop the sleds
over there,

22:15.700 --> 22:16.967
there's no getting them out,

22:17.000 --> 22:19.367
and I'm gonna have
to be really cautious

Actually out of the Arctic,
but it's no warmer

22:57.333 --> 22:58.533
'cause we're not going
that far out.

Yeah. It's supposed
to go to 45.

23:52.067 --> 23:55.767

untie the poles,
we take the tent,

from people whose ancestors
lived out here

24:43.767 --> 24:45.300
for thousands of years,

24:47.900 --> 24:49.833
is not to worry too much
about the future.

You never know what the
future is gonna bring.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.833
So why the hell spend
so much time planning for it?

25:07.033 --> 25:10.267
I'm not looking
for a particular animal
most of the time.

25:10.300 --> 25:11.700
I'm just looking for food.

25:12.467 --> 25:14.400
Wolves led me up to the ridge.

25:14.433 --> 25:15.733
There's no sign of caribou,

25:15.767 --> 25:18.567
so what I'm hoping is that
I might get some small game.

25:24.533 --> 25:28.067
First time through
on snowshoes
is always a lot of work.

25:28.100 --> 25:30.967
Once I get a trail it's
no problem travelling it,

25:31.000 --> 25:34.467
but the first time through
takes a lot of effort.

25:36.267 --> 25:39.100
Takes a lot of patience
hunting up here in the Arctic.

25:39.133 --> 25:40.333
It's hungry country.

25:40.367 --> 25:42.200
I just walk through
the forest slowly

25:42.233 --> 25:44.967
usually when I'm looking
for small game.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.733
If you're a spruce grouse
you fly around,

25:46.767 --> 25:50.167
you land in spruce trees,
and you eat spruce needles

25:51.933 --> 25:53.667
and it's sprucey.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.500
I like to know what all
of this stuff tastes like.

25:55.533 --> 25:58.533
The willows, the aspens,
the spruce.

25:58.567 --> 26:00.033
They all have
different flavours.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.733
Life has meaning out here

26:03.767 --> 26:07.033
because everything
I do every day

26:07.067 --> 26:09.233
is somehow connected
to my survival.

26:09.267 --> 26:10.633
That's why I don't believe
in vacations.

26:10.667 --> 26:12.267
Like I don't need it
because it's...

26:12.300 --> 26:14.600
It's so enjoyable,
just the actual work.

26:14.633 --> 26:15.700
I don't differentiate

26:15.733 --> 26:18.633
between recreation
and survival actually.

26:18.667 --> 26:19.833
It's all the same thing.

26:24.533 --> 26:26.133
There's a spruce grouse
right in that tree

26:26.167 --> 26:27.400
feeding on the needles.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.733
Where there's one spruce
grouse there are often others.

26:35.800 --> 26:38.200
Before I start shooting
I gotta look around.

26:40.333 --> 26:42.167
If there are more I don't want
to scare them away.

26:44.300 --> 26:45.900
There's one right there.

26:45.933 --> 26:49.667
There's another one on
that branch just frozen.

26:54.900 --> 26:56.533
I'm gonna try and get
all three of those.

27:04.733 --> 27:05.800

27:08.900 --> 27:10.067

27:11.367 --> 27:12.600
Yeah, well, she's still there.

27:13.667 --> 27:14.833
(GUNSHOT)

27:40.467 --> 27:41.833
Nice.

27:41.867 --> 27:45.700
That's that male that was
feeding on the spruce needles.

27:45.733 --> 27:48.200
The other one
was right over this way.

27:48.233 --> 27:51.967
Sometimes finding them
is the hardest part.

27:56.033 --> 27:58.867
Yeah. There it is.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.700
I definitely hit
all three of them.

28:08.467 --> 28:10.433
Oh, there she is over there.

28:18.067 --> 28:19.700
There, got all three of them.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.800
That'll make a nice meal.

28:22.900 --> 28:23.933
Maybe even two.

28:27.200 --> 28:29.400
I got three spruce grouse,

28:29.433 --> 28:31.133
and I'm headed home
to cook them.

28:31.167 --> 28:32.933
A lot of times
you don't get all of them.

28:32.967 --> 28:35.733
They're together
when you shoot the first time,

28:35.767 --> 28:37.233
a couple others will fly away.

28:37.267 --> 28:39.533
But today I got all three
that were here.

28:41.733 --> 28:45.500
Birds are singing,
squirrels are barking,

28:45.533 --> 28:47.333
it's just like paradise
out here today.

28:48.533 --> 28:51.333
Wolves led me up
to, uh, the ridge.

28:51.367 --> 28:53.033
Looked around,
I could see the moose tracks

28:53.067 --> 28:54.567
that the wolves
were following.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.867
One thing turned
into the next.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.500
I come home
with three grouse.

28:58.533 --> 29:01.433
I mean, I feel like
I'm just another hunter
like the wolves.

29:01.467 --> 29:06.467
It's just a very basic,
primal way of getting food.

29:06.500 --> 29:07.800
That feels good.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.967
I mean, I feel lucky just
being able to go out there

29:10.000 --> 29:11.833
and walk around in the woods
all day to get my food,

29:11.867 --> 29:14.233
rather than sitting in
an office or doing something

29:14.267 --> 29:15.567
that I wouldn't enjoy as much.

29:19.467 --> 29:20.567
SUE: You know,
I'm just a fat chick

29:20.600 --> 29:22.200
trying to make a business
on the tundra.

29:35.300 --> 29:39.400
I started attacking my snow
because my meat shed,

29:39.433 --> 29:41.833
where I had stored all of
my food and my frozen meat,

29:41.867 --> 29:44.000
that's already under
a 17-foot drift.

29:44.033 --> 29:46.633
So if that storm comes
in pummelling me,

29:46.667 --> 29:47.967
it's gonna crush my building.

29:49.367 --> 29:50.400
I warmed up my pinkies.

29:50.433 --> 29:53.033
I put on some serious
warmer gear.

29:54.767 --> 29:59.800
I got a long ways to go,
and now I gotta hit it again.

30:05.667 --> 30:07.133
There's nothing that quite
prepares you

30:07.167 --> 30:08.900
for spending a couple of weeks

30:08.933 --> 30:10.933
alone in Kavik in the winter.

30:10.967 --> 30:13.233
You know, any number
of things can happen.

30:13.267 --> 30:15.733
There's always something
else I can learn.

30:15.767 --> 30:18.367
There's always
something else I can do.

30:18.400 --> 30:21.967
There's always room for
improvement in any lifestyle.

30:23.100 --> 30:25.700
Mine happens to be such that

30:25.733 --> 30:28.700
I must rely on myself
in the end.

30:28.733 --> 30:30.300
When I'm the only one
that I count on

30:30.333 --> 30:32.567
in the winter
to get my chores done,

30:32.600 --> 30:34.133
you know, the only ass
that gets kicked

30:34.167 --> 30:36.067
for not completing
the job is my own.

30:38.633 --> 30:40.767
They're saying 50 to 70 below
for tonight.

30:40.800 --> 30:42.267
I definitely believe it.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.900
I'm not sure where
I'm sitting right now,

30:43.933 --> 30:46.233
I really don't care.
All's I know is it's cold
and getting colder,

30:46.267 --> 30:47.633
so I gotta get my job done.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.067
Making some head way.

30:51.100 --> 30:53.233
I'm keeping
this kind of cleared

30:53.267 --> 30:55.033
to move it way away
from camp.

30:55.067 --> 30:57.367
So it drains away from camp
when it melts.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.267
I don't know exactly
when it's gonna hit.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.167
I just know it's all coming
together for the perfect storm

31:13.033 --> 31:14.400
and I gotta be ready.

31:15.867 --> 31:17.300
If not, I've lost my food.

31:17.333 --> 31:19.133
I've lost my ability
to get to the food.

31:19.167 --> 31:20.333
I've lost the building.

31:20.367 --> 31:22.800
I can't absorb a 40, 50
thousand dollar hit.

31:30.100 --> 31:31.767
When you're driving
that Bobcat

31:31.800 --> 31:33.567
you're being jammed
and slammed.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.333
There's no suspension in it.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.300
I gotta be careful
with the Bobcat.

31:40.033 --> 31:41.367
Getting too close to it now.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.000
I mean, that thing
can cave any minute.

31:45.567 --> 31:47.133
I gotta use a gentle touch.

31:49.633 --> 31:51.400
This is the part where
I've gotta pay attention.

31:51.433 --> 31:52.667
I've gotta get the weight off

31:52.700 --> 31:55.033
without pushing on that
building any more.

32:02.267 --> 32:04.767
You put the bucket down,
and you've gotta scrape.

32:09.133 --> 32:10.467
You know,
that piece of machinery,

32:10.500 --> 32:12.300
if I tell it to come down,
it's gonna come down.

32:12.333 --> 32:14.067
If I'm too close,
I'm gonna be the problem.

32:17.033 --> 32:18.200
God damn it.

32:20.000 --> 32:22.000
Ah!

32:22.033 --> 32:24.100
You have got to
be fucking kidding me.

32:26.633 --> 32:28.667
(COUGHS)

32:28.700 --> 32:33.467
Well, I got the snow away
from the building,

32:33.500 --> 32:37.567
but, um, I can see just the
snow from that one storm,

32:37.600 --> 32:41.167
heavy enough, dense enough,
it bent my building.

32:41.200 --> 32:42.667
And you can see
how it's bowed.

32:42.700 --> 32:44.667
I'll take a look at it
from the inside,

32:44.700 --> 32:48.700
but, uh, that's gonna be
a son of a bitch.

32:56.133 --> 33:00.200
(COUGHS) What I got
going on here, you can
see right here, man,

33:00.233 --> 33:01.367
it is bowed out.

33:02.700 --> 33:04.000
I mean, it's...

33:06.100 --> 33:09.000
'Cause this whole building
is built to shift

33:09.033 --> 33:10.533
when the wind hits.

33:10.567 --> 33:13.767
Shift, you know,
so if I put a two by four
down and brace it,

33:13.800 --> 33:14.967
all's that's gonna happen

33:15.000 --> 33:16.267
is this thing is
gonna rock and roll

33:16.300 --> 33:18.767
in the next big windstorm,
and I'm gonna puncture this.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.500
So, that's not an option,

33:20.533 --> 33:23.267
but, you know, in here I got
food for Kavik,

33:23.300 --> 33:26.433
uh, like in the business
as well as myself.

33:26.467 --> 33:28.567
My game meat.

33:30.033 --> 33:34.733
I've got caribou meat,
you know, bear,

33:36.900 --> 33:39.600
and, uh, if this building
does come down,

33:39.633 --> 33:41.867
I mean, this is my meat.
These are all freezers.

33:41.900 --> 33:44.733
You got 10, 20 grand
wrapped up in the building.

33:44.767 --> 33:47.033
Probably five to eight
grand in food.

33:47.067 --> 33:50.300
Toss another few grand
on the freezers to replace,

33:50.333 --> 33:53.400
and, uh, I don't know,
$5,000 a round trip

33:53.433 --> 33:55.400
for every 2,000 pounds
I fly in.

33:55.433 --> 33:57.633
I mean, this'll rack up quick.

33:57.667 --> 33:59.267
So, this little building,

33:59.300 --> 34:02.400
if it makes it through this
winter, I'll tear it apart.

34:02.433 --> 34:03.967
Then that's the time
in the summer,

34:04.000 --> 34:06.867
I'll kick on the heat on it,
re-bend those pipes

34:06.900 --> 34:09.667
till they're the right shape.

34:09.700 --> 34:10.900
Get it all put back together.

34:10.933 --> 34:12.567
Probably spot-weld it
a little bit,

34:12.600 --> 34:14.867
but get it into a home where
it doesn't have to worry

34:14.900 --> 34:16.033
about the drifting so much.

I can do with the bucket.

hadn't gotten to it tonight,

34:26.067 --> 34:27.233
I would not have it.

34:27.267 --> 34:29.500

with a little bit of wind,

Oh, shit! You better not.

38:31.900 --> 38:33.967
This could all go to hell
really quick.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.100
Oh, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh!

38:41.500 --> 38:42.967
Come on. Get in that track.

38:47.067 --> 38:48.667
Come on, boy.
Get in that track.

38:49.633 --> 38:51.367
Attaboy. Stay in there.

38:54.967 --> 38:57.367
All right. Yeehaw!

39:00.033 --> 39:01.600
Whoa!

39:01.633 --> 39:03.667
Whoo, boy.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.433
That was a close call.

39:05.467 --> 39:06.867
That's a good feeling.

39:06.900 --> 39:08.333
That's a load off
my mind right now.

39:08.367 --> 39:12.500
I just came through that,
um, I call it the luge,

39:12.533 --> 39:15.333
the area I shovelled out,
and it was pretty dicey.

39:15.367 --> 39:18.733
That back sled almost
went off two times.

39:18.767 --> 39:20.933
I got it into the area
I shovelled,

39:20.967 --> 39:22.467
but one point
the back end of it

39:22.500 --> 39:24.000
was overhanging the ice there.

39:24.033 --> 39:27.633
But the ice held, so heart
was pounding a little bit,

39:27.667 --> 39:29.733
and it was kind of like
(LAUGHS) damn.

39:29.767 --> 39:30.833
I'm this close to home.

39:30.867 --> 39:32.433
I don't need this
happening now.

39:35.133 --> 39:39.567
That would be pretty ugly
to go over on. (CHUCKLES)

39:39.600 --> 39:41.800
But there's quite another
big crack in the ice

39:41.833 --> 39:43.533
right back here
heading upriver.

39:43.567 --> 39:45.567
You know, after seeing this
big chunk of ice

39:45.600 --> 39:47.033
break off the other day,

39:47.067 --> 39:49.400
my eyes are tuned into these
cracks in the ice

39:49.433 --> 39:52.933
a whole lot more now than
they were a week or so ago.

39:55.067 --> 39:56.467
I now know what's possible.

39:56.500 --> 39:59.000
I never would've thought that
a big chunk of ice like that

39:59.033 --> 40:01.433
could've come off
and did what it had done.

40:05.167 --> 40:06.567
Good learning lesson for me.

40:06.600 --> 40:10.067
I really picked up a few new
clues to look at the ice

40:10.100 --> 40:12.767
and decide whether
it's safe or not.

40:12.800 --> 40:15.200
Every time you go out here
you learn something new.

40:15.233 --> 40:18.200
Good or bad, that's life
on the Yukon, man.
(CHUCKLES)

40:24.100 --> 40:26.500
CHIP: I like the
zero temperature.

40:26.533 --> 40:27.667
It's a good
working temperature

40:27.700 --> 40:29.000
and we can stay outside.

40:30.233 --> 40:32.600
Zero degrees isn't too cold,
and it's not too hot.

40:42.200 --> 40:45.900
I'm carving snow blocks
with a shovel,

40:46.767 --> 40:48.033
and I'm making a wind break.

40:49.867 --> 40:50.967
Not only is it a wind break,

40:51.000 --> 40:52.067
it's also some weight

40:52.100 --> 40:54.700
on the edge of my, uh, tent.

40:54.733 --> 40:57.533
It was kind of warm out, and
then the wind picked up.

40:57.567 --> 40:59.133
So I put on my leather,

40:59.167 --> 41:02.033
and I go make sure that my
tent isn't gonna go anywhere.

41:02.067 --> 41:05.000
Especially if my wife's here
and I'm not.

41:05.033 --> 41:07.300
It'd be pretty tough keeping
something like that
down in the wind.

41:07.333 --> 41:08.400
Like a big sail.

41:08.433 --> 41:11.067
I got just a few more pieces
to put here.

41:11.100 --> 41:12.867
When I'm done with that I'm
gonna go get some firewood.

41:20.867 --> 41:26.067
This is an old broken
down, uh, storage rack.

41:26.100 --> 41:29.600
We used to keep, uh, meat
and all kinds of stuff here.

41:29.633 --> 41:32.467
But we purposely left firewood
here just in case we came back

41:32.500 --> 41:34.800
and happened to need firewood
when we got here.

41:34.833 --> 41:36.400
Time to take these over here
and whack 'em up.

41:38.900 --> 41:42.000
This is the Arctic,
and heat is a big priority.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.233
Getting wood
is the way we heat.

41:46.733 --> 41:49.367
So this is a very constant
chore for me.

41:49.400 --> 41:51.800
It's just
as important of a job
as keeping people fed.

41:53.267 --> 41:55.433
Tomorrow we'll get more wood
and build a big fire.

42:00.167 --> 42:02.633
Man, I'll tell you what,
my top half is tired.

42:02.667 --> 42:04.600
My back is tired,
my shoulder's tired,

42:04.633 --> 42:06.667
my elbows are tired.

42:06.700 --> 42:08.000
But that's what coffee's for!

42:09.700 --> 42:13.133
Just getting here was an
adventure all on its own, huh?

42:13.167 --> 42:15.033
-It was fun.
-Yeah, it was fun.

42:15.067 --> 42:17.833
I've done this so many times
the adventure part's gone.

42:17.867 --> 42:20.767
But, um, you know
what it's been replaced by?

42:20.800 --> 42:23.033
Is I'm content.

42:23.067 --> 42:24.867
I know where I'm going
and I know what I'm doing.

42:25.533 --> 42:27.900
And none of this is new.

42:27.933 --> 42:30.333
This is all very comforting.

42:30.933 --> 42:32.200
New stuff is exciting,

42:32.233 --> 42:35.600
but doing this same stuff
over is more comforting.

42:35.633 --> 42:37.900
And I just feel terribly
normal being here.
