WEBVTT

02:03.360 --> 02:04.919
Kaylie!

02:04.920 --> 02:06.631
Shh!

02:25.800 --> 02:27.590
And I fired.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.708
As many times as I've
had this dream...

02:32.400 --> 02:34.245
it's never been me before.

02:34.840 --> 02:36.346
Holding the gun.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.311
I know.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.745
That's very good.

02:43.400 --> 02:48.199
It implies a true, deeply-rooted
acceptance of responsibility.

02:48.200 --> 02:50.639
And it tells me that you haven't
only overcome your delusion

02:50.640 --> 02:52.159
in your conscious mind...

02:52.160 --> 02:54.679
but in his subconscious
mind as well.

02:54.680 --> 02:57.439
It's my opinion that
Tim is a healthy adult

02:57.440 --> 03:00.639
who represents no danger
to himself or anyone else.

03:00.640 --> 03:04.399
And I believe he should be
discharged, as the state requested,

03:04.400 --> 03:06.828
on his upcoming 21st birthday.

03:13.680 --> 03:16.039
going once...

03:16.040 --> 03:18.359
eleven-five twice...

03:18.360 --> 03:19.919
Sold to the gentleman.

03:19.920 --> 03:23.941
Congratulations to you, sir.
That's bidder number 131.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.719
All right, and our
next item for bid

03:28.720 --> 03:33.479
is a gorgeous antique mirror,
recovered from the Levesque Estate.

03:33.480 --> 03:36.399
The Lasser Glass is a
well-traveled gem.

03:36.400 --> 03:39.959
It spent several seasons adorning
the walls at Balmoral Castle,

03:39.960 --> 03:42.199
Scottish home of the Royal Family.

03:42.200 --> 03:45.599
This is the original glass
and the original frame.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.079
The mirror is in remarkable condition,
save for a small hairline fracture

03:49.080 --> 03:50.999
down in the lower
right-hand corner.

03:51.000 --> 03:54.879
The frame is carved out of one
piece of Bavarian Black Cedar.

03:54.880 --> 03:56.639
And we will go ahead
and start the bidding

03:56.640 --> 03:58.919
at a conservative ten
thousand dollars.

03:58.920 --> 04:01.159
Do I have ten? Right here
in front. Thank you, sir.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.039
Your sister is picking
you up, then?

04:03.040 --> 04:06.742
Her message even said something
about helping me find a job.

04:07.400 --> 04:09.559
That'd be wonderful
for your transition.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.399
We're at 12,000 dollars
on the phone...

04:11.400 --> 04:13.599
You sure you don't want
me to come with you?

04:13.600 --> 04:17.478
- Some moral support?
- No. But thank you.

04:17.480 --> 04:20.039
I think I better do
this part myself.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.839
- Wait up for us.
- Of course.

04:22.840 --> 04:25.679
Remember what we talked about.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.279
You've had a support system,
a mandated support system,

04:28.280 --> 04:31.879
to help you get well. Kaylie
had to get by on her own.

04:31.880 --> 04:35.599
It's very important that you
reconnect with your sister.

04:35.600 --> 04:39.700
But it's more important that
you protect your recovery.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.839
- Sixteen thousand.
- Sixteen thousand on Skype.

04:44.840 --> 04:48.599
That is sixteen, going once.
Sixteen twice.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.879
Sold. Please pass along
our congratulations.

04:50.880 --> 04:52.864
- See you tonight.
- OK.

05:05.080 --> 05:08.429
Son, just pull the
door when it buzzes.

05:30.880 --> 05:32.909
Hey, little brother.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.588
Your half of the estate.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.679
Oh, apartments.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.519
So all the studies say
that you should transition

05:52.520 --> 05:54.319
to a place that isn't
necessarily large,

05:54.320 --> 05:56.399
so I printed off some
listings for studios.

05:56.400 --> 05:59.919
But in the meantime, until
you find one you like,

05:59.920 --> 06:02.143
we would love it if
you stayed with us.

06:03.680 --> 06:05.519
Kaylie, I don't know
how to thank you.

06:05.520 --> 06:08.903
Well, I wanted to talk to you
about all of this sooner.

06:10.400 --> 06:12.941
But suddenly they wouldn't
let me in to see you.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.959
It wasn't...

06:16.960 --> 06:20.548
It wasn't that they wouldn't
let you in to see me.

06:22.200 --> 06:26.300
I just had some things I needed
to figure out for myself.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.465
I get it.

06:33.360 --> 06:35.559
I'm your family.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.431
The only thing that matters
is that you're here now.

06:46.560 --> 06:48.305
I found it.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.999
- What do you mean?
- You know.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.759
It wasn't easy.

06:58.760 --> 07:02.399
I tracked it down mostly through second
bidders, people who lost at the auctions.

07:02.400 --> 07:04.919
It was in storage, part of an
estate collection in Bremen.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.599
It took me a year and a half
to get it into our warehouse

07:07.600 --> 07:09.279
and it lasted less than a week.

07:09.280 --> 07:12.199
It's about to ship out to a new
buyer, so we only have a few days,

07:12.200 --> 07:14.150
but it should be enough.

07:15.480 --> 07:17.942
A few days for what, Kaylie?

07:19.000 --> 07:21.507
To keep our promise.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.585
And kill it.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.839
OK, guys, the couch can go there.

07:36.840 --> 07:38.799
And those boxes are kitchen.

07:38.800 --> 07:41.910
- Bam! Bam!
- Tim, we don't shoot the movers.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.599
And as soon as I get my files
organized, you will have them.

07:46.600 --> 07:48.199
Yes. Shoot.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.786
Can I call you back?

07:51.720 --> 07:54.439
Jeff, I am so sorry I
didn't return your call.

07:54.440 --> 07:57.959
I've just been slammed. It's a lot
easier when you have a staff.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.719
- Kaylie's under arrest.
- She's not here, buddy.

08:01.720 --> 08:03.079
Sneak attack!

08:03.080 --> 08:04.959
You are so dead!

08:04.960 --> 08:06.559
Honey?

08:06.560 --> 08:09.879
And this goes? OK,
against the wall.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.639
Watch the molding.

08:11.640 --> 08:15.759
Thank you. OK. OK. It's fragile.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.599
- Hey, guys! Take it outside.
- But, Mom...

08:19.600 --> 08:21.519
The alternative is moving boxes.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.879
Oh, come on. Come on.

08:22.880 --> 08:24.759
So we'll talk soon. OK.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.919
Thanks, guys. OK.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.439
I'll be right out.

08:29.440 --> 08:31.479
So you expanded the
furniture order?

08:31.480 --> 08:34.558
I don't know if I'm
loving this desk here.

08:34.559 --> 08:38.227
Were you gonna tell me or just
wait till I saw the Visa bill?

08:39.400 --> 08:40.701
Hold on.

08:42.440 --> 08:47.679
I was hoping to smooth that over
with a three-piece vanity set

08:47.680 --> 08:51.519
that is supposed to be here...
Is it not here?

08:54.600 --> 08:57.399
I get it. OK. Do your
office however you want.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.079
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

08:59.080 --> 09:02.279
It's a bit ostentatious,
though, don't you think?

09:02.280 --> 09:05.799
I'm confused, because you
wanted the antiques.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.719
And I said I was fine with IKEA.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.439
Yeah, I wanted to get a few
pieces to upgrade the place,

09:10.440 --> 09:12.119
not turn it into a showroom.

09:12.120 --> 09:15.399
Listen, we got a new
home, a new company,

09:15.400 --> 09:18.704
so we get new furniture.
Makes sense.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.599
Same old wife, though, right?

09:21.600 --> 09:24.506
Well, I told you I
was fine with IKEA.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.511
- Kidding.
- I'm not IKEA.

09:35.560 --> 09:39.159
You sure you prefer this?

09:39.160 --> 09:42.703
Our guest room is a
lot nicer than this.

09:43.600 --> 09:46.506
Yeah. I think it might be best.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.626
My own space.

09:55.800 --> 09:58.910
You promised me you'd never
forget what really happened.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.710
You promised.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.999
I was ten years old.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.631
Well...

10:07.640 --> 10:09.799
I'm doing it tomorrow night.

10:09.800 --> 10:13.502
And... I could really,
really use your help.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.830
Good night, Tim.

10:48.600 --> 10:52.461
I feel like my scar is more noticeable
now than it was ten years ago.

10:53.560 --> 10:55.719
Let me take a look.
I'm a professional.

10:57.240 --> 11:00.439
What scar?

11:00.440 --> 11:03.639
We're nowhere near done.

11:03.640 --> 11:04.919
So?

11:04.920 --> 11:07.302
You've only put together the bed.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.984
That wasn't easy.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.110
Damn it.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.984
Shit.

13:58.120 --> 14:00.999
No! No! No!

14:01.000 --> 14:05.599
No! No! No!

14:05.600 --> 14:09.719
It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.

14:09.720 --> 14:12.079
It's OK. It's OK.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.759
It's just one of your night
terrors. It's OK. Shh...

14:16.760 --> 14:20.064
Shh...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.359
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:53.360 --> 14:56.439
So I requisitioned you your own printer.
You don't have to share anymore.

14:56.440 --> 14:59.679
- We'll take you off the network.
- OK.

14:59.680 --> 15:01.999
Because I guess there were
some complaints about people

15:02.000 --> 15:04.519
printing out their sales reports
and finding some really...

15:04.520 --> 15:07.519
graphic crime scene
photos from, uh...

15:07.520 --> 15:09.629
your computer.

15:16.920 --> 15:19.799
I noticed you put in a transfer
order for the Lasser Glass.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.319
- Yeah, as a repair.
- Oh.

15:22.320 --> 15:24.239
I thought Warren said no repairs.

15:24.240 --> 15:26.224
He changed his mind.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.679
Got to be honest, I'm really
just waiting for an explanation

15:29.680 --> 15:32.028
for the corpse print-outs.

15:42.760 --> 15:45.439
I know things have
been strange at times.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.519
And you know I'm dealing
with some dark stuff,

15:47.520 --> 15:50.221
some parental stuff, with Tim out.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.991
I'll never expect you to
understand that part of my life.

15:57.880 --> 16:00.399
Just bear with me a
day or two more.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.959
Things will get back to normal.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.625
I promise.

16:12.720 --> 16:16.199
I don't usually get transfer orders
to third-party repair houses.

16:16.200 --> 16:19.559
Oh, yeah, the buyer wants his guy
to look at it before it ships.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.039
- But we both know you'd do it better.
- No argument there.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.469
I'll take it there myself. Babysit
it every step of the way.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.306
Better get some furni pads
if we're going to move her.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.264
Hello again.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.624
You must be hungry.

17:20.960 --> 17:23.547
I hope this still hurts.

18:47.880 --> 18:49.545
You're all set.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.871
You all right?

18:55.600 --> 18:56.947
I'm great.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.959
The guys will wrap her
up for you in a bit.

19:01.960 --> 19:03.705
Thank you, Warren.

19:17.080 --> 19:19.439
I'll see you at home.

19:19.440 --> 19:22.584
My car is by the loading dock.

19:23.920 --> 19:25.479
- Hello.
- Hey.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.519
- Got a phone.
- Cool.

19:27.520 --> 19:28.959
You just need to sign the order.

19:28.960 --> 19:31.759
I don't feel good about the
way we left it last night.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.559
Can we meet up somewhere and talk?

19:33.560 --> 19:36.039
Of course. Can you
come by the house?

19:36.040 --> 19:37.839
Sure. What's your address?

19:37.840 --> 19:40.950
No. The house.

20:18.320 --> 20:20.719
Yes, I have it in front of me.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.999
I don't know, probably half
an hour. Does that work?

20:24.000 --> 20:25.559
OK.

20:25.560 --> 20:27.430
Speak then.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.599
Oh, crap.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.679
I'm gonna get you, you little brat!

21:23.880 --> 21:25.319
The answer is still no.

21:25.320 --> 21:27.679
Oh, my God, Ally has one
and Maddie has one.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.999
I'm the only kid in my
class without a phone.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.839
That is terrible.

21:31.840 --> 21:33.959
Thanks for nothing, Marie.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.039
Oh!

21:36.040 --> 21:39.519
I'm going to run out and get one
for you right now, daughter,

21:39.520 --> 21:42.479
love of my life, fruit of my loins.

21:42.480 --> 21:44.703
Well, I wish I'd been a pineapple.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.879
Hey kids, do me a favor and don't ever
chew your nails like your father.

21:52.880 --> 21:55.239
- It's gross.
- Hey, Dad?

21:55.240 --> 21:57.159
OK... He's Dad. I'm Marie.

21:57.160 --> 22:00.479
Who was that lady in
your office today?

22:00.480 --> 22:04.910
Yeah, Dad, who was that
lady in your office today?

22:06.160 --> 22:07.791
What lady?

22:09.720 --> 22:12.387
I don't know. Just some lady.

22:16.080 --> 22:17.666
I don't know.

22:42.400 --> 22:44.479
It looks so small.

22:44.480 --> 22:47.119
- Go on, Dog.
- You named your dog, Dog?

22:47.120 --> 22:50.310
No. He doesn't have a name.

22:51.200 --> 22:52.740
Are you OK?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.704
Oh, of course.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.950
You haven't been here since...

23:03.760 --> 23:05.471
Why don't you look around?

24:12.200 --> 24:15.799
The house just sat on the market
while I was in the foster system.

24:15.800 --> 24:19.079
Released to me when I turned 18.

24:19.080 --> 24:22.509
I was the only homeowner in the
freshman dorms when I started school.

24:25.480 --> 24:28.319
I'm thinking we should
try and sell it, though.

24:28.320 --> 24:30.224
You know, after.

24:32.240 --> 24:35.191
So will you help me with
something before you go?

24:45.320 --> 24:47.679
How the hell did you expect to
get this thing in here yourself?

24:47.680 --> 24:49.319
To be honest, I didn't.

24:49.320 --> 24:51.479
I always thought
it'd be both of us.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.759
Over here for now.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.186
OK.

25:28.640 --> 25:30.599
What's that?

25:30.600 --> 25:32.868
Yacht anchor. Kill switch.

25:34.960 --> 25:36.959
So, uh...

25:36.960 --> 25:38.719
I understand if you
don't want to stay.

25:38.720 --> 25:42.388
I accept that, but I
got to get started.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.782
I'll stay for a little bit.

25:53.760 --> 25:55.425
Excuse me.

26:02.680 --> 26:07.039
Hello. My name is
Kaylie Ann Russell.

26:07.040 --> 26:08.359
I'm 23 years old.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.799
I'm with my brother,
Timothy Alan Russell.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.639
Alan, of course, after his father.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.305
He's...

26:16.080 --> 26:17.679
He's 21 years old.

26:17.680 --> 26:20.399
It's 4:15pm on October 13th,

26:20.400 --> 26:23.079
and we are at 2705 Hawthorne Way.

26:23.080 --> 26:27.559
I'll begin by detailing my precautions
before I place and uncover the glass.

26:27.560 --> 26:30.279
There are three cameras, each on
its own independent power circuit,

26:30.280 --> 26:33.079
so if any anomalies occur, there
can be a lucid, objective record.

26:33.080 --> 26:36.119
I have private land lines for today's
experiment, along with my cell phone.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.759
And I will now ask my
brother for his phone,

26:38.760 --> 26:42.143
so that I can control
all electronic devices.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.671
I just got this, you know.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.191
Thanks, Timbo.

26:54.160 --> 26:56.559
This alarm is set to go
off every 45 minutes

26:56.560 --> 26:58.799
to remind me to change the
tapes in the cameras.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.479
This alarm is set to go off
hourly to remind us to eat.

27:01.480 --> 27:04.479
And we're fully stocked on
water to prevent dehydration.

27:04.480 --> 27:06.159
Now, as for the house itself...

27:06.160 --> 27:08.719
each room is fitted with
its own thermostat,

27:08.720 --> 27:11.319
from which data is collected by
software designed to track and record

27:11.320 --> 27:12.959
temperature fluctuations
in hospitals.

27:12.960 --> 27:15.759
Any temperature changes greater than
five degrees in either direction

27:15.760 --> 27:17.839
will set off an alarm.

27:17.840 --> 27:19.639
A third precaution
is also in place,

27:19.640 --> 27:21.919
but I'll get into that
in a few more minutes.

27:21.920 --> 27:24.199
So...

27:24.200 --> 27:26.199
The purpose of today's experiment

27:26.200 --> 27:28.639
is to prove that the object
behind me, the Lasser Glass,

27:28.640 --> 27:31.999
is home to an observable,
predictable supernatural force.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.559
There's no scientific equivalent
for the word "haunted,"

27:34.560 --> 27:38.399
so we'll just say this object is
responsible for at least 45 deaths

27:38.400 --> 27:40.719
in the four centuries of
its recorded existence...

27:40.720 --> 27:42.959
Can I just stop you for a second?

27:42.960 --> 27:45.183
Don't ever turn off a camera.

27:46.680 --> 27:48.266
Sorry.

27:54.840 --> 27:57.319
The origin of the Lasser
Glass is unknown,

27:57.320 --> 27:59.439
so I can't provide a
complete history,

27:59.440 --> 28:03.439
but the trail starts
in London in 1754.

28:03.440 --> 28:06.719
Philip Lasser, the 17th
Earl of Leicester,

28:06.720 --> 28:09.359
acquired the mirror and hung
it over his fireplace, and...

28:09.360 --> 28:12.159
Another precaution.

28:12.160 --> 28:14.319
Hi, sweetie. How are you?

28:14.320 --> 28:18.079
Well, I'm checking in,
uh, as requested.

28:18.080 --> 28:20.199
- You all right?
- Everything's fine.

28:20.200 --> 28:22.919
I know this is silly to ask, but
could you try to call on the hour?

28:22.920 --> 28:24.959
It's about seven past.

28:24.960 --> 28:28.959
- Uh... Sure.
- I'll talk to you in 53 minutes.

28:28.960 --> 28:31.759
And I love you.

28:31.760 --> 28:35.279
I'm expecting regular calls
from my fiance, Michael Dumont.

28:35.280 --> 28:37.399
I told him I'm nervous to be
spending time with my recently

28:37.400 --> 28:39.199
un-incarcerated brother,
with instructions...

28:39.200 --> 28:40.519
- to notify the authorities immediately
- Wow.

28:40.520 --> 28:41.999
if I do not answer the phone.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.839
- In the room.
- Nothing personal.

28:44.840 --> 28:48.759
So, in 1755, Philip Lasser was
found in their grand fireplace.

28:48.760 --> 28:52.719
Burned beyond recognition.
While his estate was dismantled

28:52.720 --> 28:54.439
and scattered throughout
southern England,

28:54.440 --> 28:56.999
one of the family's stewards claimed
to see Philip reflected in the mirror.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.279
An allegation apparently taken
seriously enough to warrant

28:59.280 --> 29:01.319
a Church investigation
into the house.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.439
The glass, thereafter known
as the Lasser Glass,

29:03.440 --> 29:06.119
is sold in public auction in 1758.

29:06.120 --> 29:09.239
The next known owner is an
American rail road tycoon,

29:09.240 --> 29:11.759
named Robert Clancy, 1864.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.239
Clancy apparently weighed
over 300 pounds.

29:14.240 --> 29:16.519
In fact, while attending
university in Connecticut,

29:16.520 --> 29:18.239
he was known as the
South Windham Whale.

29:18.240 --> 29:21.079
He hung the glass in his
ballroom in Atlanta.

29:21.080 --> 29:23.599
Later that year, Robert
Clancy is photographed

29:23.600 --> 29:25.759
by a local newspaper and, uh...

29:25.760 --> 29:28.199
Well, he's dropped a few pounds.

29:28.200 --> 29:31.439
His obit was printed a few weeks later.
Doesn't list a cause of death.

29:31.440 --> 29:34.199
Unfortunately, he and his
estate and the glass

29:34.200 --> 29:37.919
are presumably destroyed in Sherman's
march to the ocean in 1865.

29:37.920 --> 29:40.719
And after that, the glass is lost.

29:40.720 --> 29:43.399
Until it resurfaces in
turn-of-the-century New England.

29:43.400 --> 29:47.079
The next case of note
is Mary O'Connor, 1904.

29:47.080 --> 29:48.799
She hung the mirror in
her private bathroom.

29:48.800 --> 29:52.279
Two weeks later, her niece Beatrice
finds Mary dead in the bathtub.

29:52.280 --> 29:56.119
Now, the official coroner's report lists
the cause of death as, get this...

29:56.120 --> 29:58.319
dehydration.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.839
The woman died of thirst while soaking
in a full tub for three days.

30:01.840 --> 30:06.399
The next case of note is Alice Carden
in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, 1943.

30:06.400 --> 30:09.519
Neighbors reported hearing screams
and loud bangs from the house.

30:09.520 --> 30:12.559
The police found the children
drowned in a locked cistern.

30:12.560 --> 30:14.159
Alice herself was in the nursery,

30:14.160 --> 30:15.879
and both of her legs are
completely shattered.

30:15.880 --> 30:19.359
Her left arm is broken in four places,
and six of her ribs are crushed.

30:19.360 --> 30:23.039
In her right hand is a large hammer she's
been using to break her own bones.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.759
They find her just as she's
going to work on her skull.

30:25.760 --> 30:27.999
Her right arm, though,
is completely unharmed.

30:28.000 --> 30:31.959
Because she needed it.
To wield the hammer.

30:31.960 --> 30:34.679
Alice later says she believed she was
tucking the children into their beds

30:34.680 --> 30:36.119
as she sealed them
into the cistern.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.479
She never recovers
from her injuries.

30:37.480 --> 30:39.559
And, oh, the family kept
several dogs at the farm,

30:39.560 --> 30:42.639
including an Australian
shepherd for the children.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.431
Let's eat.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.310
Who exactly are you talking to?
On those tapes?

31:07.800 --> 31:11.119
All the people who stared, pointed.

31:11.120 --> 31:13.999
The kids at school who
always found out.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.588
I guess I'm talking to everyone
who ever called Dad a murderer.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.309
Called you a murderer.

31:21.080 --> 31:24.519
Look, Kaylie, we were just kids.

31:24.520 --> 31:27.319
We made up a scary story so we
wouldn't have to accept the fact

31:27.320 --> 31:29.639
that our father was
a murderer. He was.

31:29.640 --> 31:32.102
He was a sick man who
tortured and killed our...

31:40.200 --> 31:43.151
You can call me crazy all you like.

31:44.240 --> 31:47.146
But you're not allowed to
talk about him that way.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.479
Tobin Capp, 1955. Starved to
death in his own bedroom.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.559
The mirror was hung over his dresser.
He had a pet Dalmatian.

31:56.560 --> 31:58.439
1965, California.

31:58.440 --> 32:01.439
The mirror hangs in the lobby of
the Hill Trust Bank in San Diego.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.599
A ten-year teller, Marcia Wicker,
locks her manager in the bank vault

32:04.600 --> 32:07.319
and then chews through
a live power line.

32:07.320 --> 32:09.999
- 1975, Marisol Chavez...
- Kaylie...

32:10.000 --> 32:12.919
dies in her bedroom of
hemorrhaging due to a miscarriage.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.959
In her nightstand, they find
every single one of her teeth

32:14.960 --> 32:17.359
in a little plastic bag and
a pair of bloody pliers.

32:17.360 --> 32:19.119
- 2002...
- There's a huge difference

32:19.120 --> 32:20.759
between causation and correlation.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.119
I know the difference, thank you.

32:22.120 --> 32:25.039
OK then. In 2001, Mom and
Dad bought that new couch.

32:25.040 --> 32:28.359
Same year, Grandpa had a heart attack,
Robbie Schultz got hit by a car.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.319
And our cat ran away.

32:30.320 --> 32:32.799
How much of that do you
blame on that couch?

32:32.800 --> 32:34.719
Can I get back to this now?

32:34.720 --> 32:37.079
Sure, but let's get to it, Kaylie.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.667
Let's talk about why
we're really here.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.226
Let's.

32:43.080 --> 32:45.319
2002.

32:45.320 --> 32:48.829
The Lasser Glass adorns the
home office of Alan Russell.

32:49.520 --> 32:52.903
Software designer.
Husband to Marie.

32:53.680 --> 32:55.479
Father to Timothy and Kaylie.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.959
Within two weeks of its arrival,

32:56.960 --> 32:58.999
Marie suffers an intense
psychological breakdown

32:59.000 --> 33:02.079
and is tortured and murdered
in the family home.

33:02.080 --> 33:03.870
By whom?

33:04.560 --> 33:06.589
By her husband.

33:07.560 --> 33:09.159
So say the police reports.

33:09.160 --> 33:13.067
And her husband was shot
to death by her own son.

33:14.240 --> 33:16.542
Right in front of her daughter.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.119
I intend to prove that none of
the people I've just described

33:22.120 --> 33:24.479
were responsible for their actions.

33:24.480 --> 33:27.599
Alan Russell was not a
murderer. He was a victim.

33:27.600 --> 33:29.119
One of many, as it turns out.

33:29.120 --> 33:31.759
Victims of the supernatural force
that resides in that mirror.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.507
So why don't we just end it right
now and smash the goddamn thing?

33:37.080 --> 33:39.348
You really don't remember, do you?

33:43.080 --> 33:45.462
Remember what?

33:46.160 --> 33:49.543
Please, smash it, by all means.

33:54.000 --> 33:55.381
Okay.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.759
You know, I've learned a lot about what
happens to people when they can't...

34:13.760 --> 34:16.301
can't process something horrible.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.706
The mind creates all kinds of
protections to help them cope.

34:22.960 --> 34:24.918
And once that belief's taken root,

34:24.920 --> 34:29.225
the mind takes random information and
forces it to support that narrative.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.879
How many thousands of records
did you have to pore through

34:34.880 --> 34:37.399
to find 12 or 13 that
support your case?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.146
Why did you put the stool down?

34:45.840 --> 34:48.239
Because I'm trying to have
a conversation with you.

34:48.239 --> 34:51.438
Uh-huh. Only one person I
know of was ever documented

34:51.440 --> 34:55.039
trying to break the mirror.
Oliver Jeffries. 1971.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.958
A teacher at Manhattan's
Duhame Academy,

34:56.960 --> 34:58.519
where the mirror hung in
the central lecture hall.

34:58.520 --> 35:01.159
One morning he reportedly ran at
the mirror with a fireplace poker,

35:01.160 --> 35:02.839
shouting about how it
needed to be destroyed,

35:02.840 --> 35:05.279
but he never struck a blow.
According to the students,

35:05.280 --> 35:06.839
he stood there quietly
for almost a minute

35:06.840 --> 35:09.984
before walking out of the
hall and into traffic.

35:11.160 --> 35:13.559
It's clearly capable of
defending itself, and...

35:13.560 --> 35:16.147
I think it just disarmed you.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.759
You know why I didn't
smash the mirror, Kaylie?

35:21.760 --> 35:26.588
Besides you getting fired or charged
with destruction of property?

35:27.280 --> 35:29.423
It isn't mine to break.

35:30.200 --> 35:32.759
No one can break your
delusion for you.

35:32.760 --> 35:34.839
You have to do it yourself.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.461
Which leads me to my
final precaution.

35:38.520 --> 35:40.999
You're looking at a
20-pound Danforth anchor.

35:41.000 --> 35:44.279
Another 20 pounds added with barbells,
attached to a modified ballast rail

35:44.280 --> 35:46.879
and a spring pin lock connected
to a mechanical kitchen timer.

35:46.880 --> 35:50.239
No electricity, which is important,
and we're about ten seconds away.

35:50.240 --> 35:52.559
If the timer is not manually
reset every 30 minutes,

35:52.560 --> 35:55.159
that is, if no one is
here to stop it...

36:00.120 --> 36:03.519
The mirror goes right there. And
the only thing to prevent that

36:03.520 --> 36:06.799
from happening again is
our continued survival.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.319
You know why we don't have to
wait for it to come out and play?

36:09.320 --> 36:12.279
Because we've got a
loaded gun to its head.

36:12.280 --> 36:15.390
And I expect it'll be
eager to defend itself.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.306
Aah!

37:56.160 --> 37:58.679
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

37:58.680 --> 38:01.984
It doesn't hurt. It doesn't hurt.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.790
Hey guys?

38:33.200 --> 38:35.741
Come into my office for a second.

38:37.520 --> 38:42.039
I thought I was pretty clear about
you guys not messing around in here.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.626
We don't.

38:44.320 --> 38:46.224
I don't like it in here.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.700
All right, well, what is this?

38:53.400 --> 38:55.145
We didn't do that.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.759
OK.

38:57.760 --> 39:02.599
You know, I can hear you guys at
night, messing around in here.

39:02.600 --> 39:07.079
I was a kid once, too. I get it.
I know the move has been difficult.

39:07.080 --> 39:09.279
This isn't gonna happen anymore.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.599
OK?

39:11.600 --> 39:14.319
And if you're messing around
with your mother's plants,

39:14.320 --> 39:16.384
you're gonna cut that out, too.

39:20.360 --> 39:23.279
You know what dead plants
are evidence of to me?

39:23.280 --> 39:26.424
Problems with the water
supply and maybe a bad tank.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.799
I seem to remember drinking
out of a Brita filter.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.999
Oliver Jeffries, dead
plants in the classroom.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.039
Tobin Capp, dead
plants in the bedroom.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.639
Garden service at Hill Trust
Bank couldn't understand

39:37.640 --> 39:40.799
why they had dead plants
all over the place.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.439
Live plant.

39:42.440 --> 39:46.039
Live plants in the living room.

39:46.040 --> 39:49.559
Live plants, plants that have life.

39:49.560 --> 39:51.199
- These are your rules, by the way.
- Give it time.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.199
It always starts with
the low-hanging fruit.

39:53.200 --> 39:55.399
It wasn't just the plants
it fed on, though.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.519
There was another variable, too.

39:57.520 --> 40:00.221
Dog!

40:03.320 --> 40:05.279
Sorry, Dog.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.785
Hydrate.

40:24.040 --> 40:26.639
- Come on, boy.
- Come on, Mason. Go fetch.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.999
- Come on. Mason.
- Go fetch.

40:29.000 --> 40:31.679
Chase the stick. Chase the stick.

40:31.680 --> 40:33.584
Come on. Go. Go.

40:35.440 --> 40:37.319
I mean, the whole
reason I got this thing

40:37.320 --> 40:39.679
was because you were freaked
out that we weren't safe.

40:39.680 --> 40:41.319
Said you saw somebody down here.

40:41.320 --> 40:43.599
Yeah, but that doesn't
make me feel safer.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.679
Quite the opposite, actually.

40:46.680 --> 40:50.359
OK, I will lock it up, unloaded,

40:50.360 --> 40:54.551
where I'm sure it'll come in very
handy in the case of an emergency.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.068
Grotesque cow.

41:07.240 --> 41:09.622
What did you just say to me?

41:10.720 --> 41:12.704
I didn't say anything.

41:46.800 --> 41:50.229
Ow! Jesus!

41:53.040 --> 41:54.479
Alan!

41:54.480 --> 41:56.908
I'm working!

42:09.880 --> 42:11.909
Who are you talking to?

42:17.720 --> 42:20.182
Were you gonna do something
about the damn barking?

42:22.320 --> 42:25.079
There's something wrong with
the dog, Alan. He bit me.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.508
Are you OK?

42:28.280 --> 42:30.344
I'm fine.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.759
You know, you are just lost
in your own world in here.

42:36.760 --> 42:39.479
I'm not lost in my own
world! I'm working!

42:39.480 --> 42:40.959
I know that.

42:40.960 --> 42:44.199
I've supported that.
This isn't you working hard.

42:44.200 --> 42:47.519
When you start your own
business, it's all on you.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.266
- I know that, Alan!
- I have to do this!

42:52.960 --> 42:56.879
Guys. Listen, you got to do
me a special favor today.

42:56.880 --> 42:58.879
I have a golf session
with a client.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.479
And I'm gonna need you to
stay out of my office. OK?

43:02.480 --> 43:04.464
OK, Dad.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.909
All right. I love you guys.

43:25.240 --> 43:29.039
Fine. You wanna go
in, you're going in.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.661
Go shit on the CEO's carpet.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.461
Shit.

43:51.040 --> 43:52.759
Why can't we let him out?

43:52.760 --> 43:55.479
Mom says Mason's grounded.

43:57.520 --> 44:00.319
Hey, squirts. Why are you, uh...?

44:00.320 --> 44:02.359
We have got to do something
about that damn dog.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.759
A hello would be nice.

44:04.760 --> 44:07.959
He was a wrecking ball all day.
I had to lock him in your office.

44:07.960 --> 44:10.581
Well, tether him up.

44:27.760 --> 44:29.300
Where is he?

44:31.760 --> 44:33.679
Well, there's the problem.
You're remembering it wrong.

44:33.680 --> 44:35.839
I promise. I'm not
remembering it wrong.

44:35.840 --> 44:38.039
- You are, though. Mason...
- Alice Carden's Australian shepherd,

44:38.040 --> 44:41.119
Tobin Capp's Dalmatian, the pets
were never found. None of them.

44:41.120 --> 44:43.239
Do you remember Mason
toward the end?

44:43.240 --> 44:46.599
Vomiting, accidents
all over the house.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.879
My therapist had me
research Parvo virus.

44:48.880 --> 44:50.679
- Oh, my God.
- It's a fatal canine illness,

44:50.680 --> 44:53.599
flagged by nausea, aggression,
infected urine and stool,

44:53.600 --> 44:56.239
which, incidentally,
can kill plants.

44:56.240 --> 44:57.519
Mason was sick.

44:59.000 --> 45:01.199
All right, I'll take him
to the vet tomorrow.

45:01.200 --> 45:03.799
Bad news. I don't think
we're both coming home.

45:03.800 --> 45:05.750
Mom, where's Mason?

45:07.880 --> 45:09.359
Uh, he's grounded.

45:09.360 --> 45:11.599
Are you saying you remember
it happening that way?

45:11.600 --> 45:13.999
- Are you really saying that?
- Why not?

45:14.000 --> 45:16.399
You're wrong. I saw Mom
lock him in the office

45:16.400 --> 45:19.239
and I sat outside that door all
day, and nobody went in or out.

45:19.240 --> 45:22.759
Have you ever heard of the fuzzy
trace theory of human psychology?

45:22.760 --> 45:24.319
No. But I'm gonna guess you have.

45:24.320 --> 45:26.599
I'm the star of a psychiatric
article about it.

45:26.600 --> 45:30.319
Our brains actually encode
information as fuzzy traces.

45:30.320 --> 45:32.719
More like a general meaning
than an exact record.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.639
- This is horseshit, Tim.
- Adults are more likely

45:34.640 --> 45:36.719
to combine those traces
into false memories.

45:36.720 --> 45:39.319
You saw Mom put the dog in the
office on a number of occasions.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.919
My God, what did they do to you?

45:40.920 --> 45:43.399
Way before Dad forbade anyone
else from going in the office.

45:43.400 --> 45:45.599
Those traces fused with
your memory of that day.

45:45.600 --> 45:49.439
- I feel sorry for you.
- OK, what's more likely?

45:49.440 --> 45:51.679
That you're misremembering
events from 11 years ago,

45:51.680 --> 45:54.028
or that the mirror eats dogs?

45:56.840 --> 45:59.188
Oh, look! It's Dog!

46:00.160 --> 46:02.799
Give it some time.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.106
A little time.

46:10.840 --> 46:14.439
There's nothing going on here,
woman! You're really losing it!

46:14.440 --> 46:18.639
I can hear you talking to someone,
and it sounds like a woman.

46:18.640 --> 46:21.559
- You know what, you're crazy!
- I'm not crazy!

46:21.560 --> 46:23.439
I can hear you talking to someone.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.439
I mean, listen to yourself!
"I can hear you through the door."

46:26.440 --> 46:29.719
Why would I make this up?
I'm not crazy!

46:29.720 --> 46:33.199
The water supply is poisoned?
And we got a burglar?

46:33.200 --> 46:35.309
You're losing your mind.

46:44.400 --> 46:47.079
I'm sorry that we woke you up.

46:47.080 --> 46:51.783
Are you and Daddy fighting because
of the woman in the office?

46:54.720 --> 46:57.639
You got to remember that woman.
You saw her too.

46:57.640 --> 47:00.519
I convinced myself I
saw a lot of things.

47:00.520 --> 47:02.599
But what did we really see?

47:02.600 --> 47:04.639
Mom yelling at Dad in the
middle of the night.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.361
Mom said she heard voices, but it
was probably just Dad on the phone.

47:10.800 --> 47:12.839
Doesn't explain the woman
I saw through the window.

47:12.840 --> 47:14.919
But when did you see her?

47:14.920 --> 47:17.159
The first time? We were
playing in the yard.

47:17.160 --> 47:18.700
Was Mom at home?

47:19.760 --> 47:21.391
Mom was always home.

47:22.160 --> 47:25.907
Are you sure about that?
Because I'm not.

47:32.160 --> 47:33.679
- Oh, shit.
- Shit.

47:33.680 --> 47:35.186
Get back. Get back.

47:39.240 --> 47:41.159
He was having an affair,
saint that he was.

47:41.160 --> 47:42.959
It was a bad marriage.
Look how it ended up.

47:42.960 --> 47:45.239
- No.
- Our father was a cheater,

47:45.240 --> 47:46.839
- and it drove our mother crazy.
- Stop it.

47:46.840 --> 47:48.799
He snapped and he killed her.
He was gonna do the same to us.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.839
Oh, yeah. A bad marriage.

47:50.840 --> 47:53.279
That explains how Mom had no
teeth, no hair, no mind left,

47:53.280 --> 47:56.279
by the time she died.
Yeah, a bad marriage.

47:56.280 --> 47:59.159
That explains those other people we
both saw in the house that last night.

47:59.160 --> 48:01.679
He was withdrawn, secretive.
All signs of an affair.

48:01.680 --> 48:03.839
I had access to all of
Mom and Dad's stuff.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.719
While you were getting
brainwashed, I looked.

48:05.720 --> 48:07.959
Not one credit card receipt,
phone call, flower order.

48:07.960 --> 48:09.279
Nothing to suggest an affair.

48:09.280 --> 48:11.079
He was smart enough
not to leave a trail.

48:11.080 --> 48:12.399
Quiet!

48:12.400 --> 48:14.159
I talked to his friends
and co-workers.

48:14.160 --> 48:15.559
If there was another
woman, she was a ghost.

48:15.560 --> 48:18.079
Yeah, I agree, he was withdrawn,
secretive, suspicious, sure.

48:18.080 --> 48:21.559
All signs of an affair, fine. I'm
not saying he wasn't seduced.

48:21.560 --> 48:24.022
It's a matter of what seduced him.

48:29.080 --> 48:31.839
And things have been happening in
here while we argue, you know.

48:31.840 --> 48:34.239
You know the temperature in here
has risen by three degrees?

48:34.240 --> 48:36.959
- Three degrees.
- Two people in a small space,

48:36.960 --> 48:38.639
lights burning,
electrical equipment...

48:38.640 --> 48:40.759
Phone lines are probably down
by now. Why don't you check?

48:40.760 --> 48:43.222
OK, then. Let's have a look.

48:43.800 --> 48:45.147
Dial tone.

48:45.760 --> 48:47.079
Static?

48:47.080 --> 48:50.999
Look, Kaylie. You can
deal with this. I did it.

48:51.000 --> 48:54.079
You want to redeem the family name?
You don't need to do it for Mom and Dad.

48:54.080 --> 48:56.519
You only need to do
it for yourself.

48:56.520 --> 48:58.679
Oh...

48:58.680 --> 49:02.399
They did a bang-up job on
you in there, didn't they?

49:02.400 --> 49:05.879
You were perfectly normal
when they locked you up.

49:05.880 --> 49:07.879
You had to go bat-shit to get out.

49:10.560 --> 49:12.319
Mason, stop your goddamn whining!

49:12.320 --> 49:13.759
You know what? That's it. I'm done.

49:13.760 --> 49:15.119
I know I'm supposed to
wait around for you

49:15.120 --> 49:16.519
to find your own way out of this.

49:16.520 --> 49:18.199
But I'm not gonna stand here
and let you torture a dog.

49:18.200 --> 49:19.759
- What do you think you're doing?
- Listen to it!

49:19.760 --> 49:22.631
Stop it! Stop it.

49:28.680 --> 49:30.391
No! No! Wait!

49:32.600 --> 49:34.639
What?

49:34.640 --> 49:37.279
- You didn't need to do that.
- Oh, yes, I did, Kaylie. You're sick.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.399
Nothing you said would
happen tonight has happened.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.719
The plants are still alive,
the mirror is just a mirror.

49:41.720 --> 49:43.943
The only thing threatening
that dog was you!

49:45.840 --> 49:48.029
And it's not your fault.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.159
Like it wasn't my fault.

49:51.160 --> 49:54.359
I had help, and you were alone.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.959
These kinds of problems
are hard to overcome,

49:55.960 --> 49:58.024
but they're nothing
to be ashamed of.

49:58.840 --> 50:00.710
They run in our family.

50:10.360 --> 50:12.469
Kaylie, I'm sorry.

50:14.520 --> 50:16.106
Look...

50:16.800 --> 50:19.239
Let's get out of here.

50:19.240 --> 50:23.465
Go some place else and
talk about how to move on.

50:41.960 --> 50:43.625
Where can we go?

50:44.640 --> 50:46.590
Oh, Kaylie...

50:47.840 --> 50:49.159
Where?

50:49.160 --> 50:53.519
Let's go turn off those
cameras, disarm that anchor...

50:53.520 --> 50:55.629
and we can go anywhere you want.

50:59.640 --> 51:02.759
Go talk to your fiancé, maybe.

51:02.760 --> 51:05.108
He'll want to help.
You know he will.

51:32.280 --> 51:34.599
Kaylie?

51:37.440 --> 51:39.230
There it is.

51:42.360 --> 51:44.344
There it is.

52:05.000 --> 52:06.870
Ha!

52:07.160 --> 52:08.586
Yes.

52:08.960 --> 52:10.421
Yes!

52:11.520 --> 52:13.026
Yes!

52:13.600 --> 52:15.399
Yes. Yes.

52:15.400 --> 52:17.907
Yes. Yes!

52:27.720 --> 52:31.039
I'm now reviewing the tape
of the last few minutes.

52:31.040 --> 52:33.319
He was having an affair,
saint that he was.

52:33.320 --> 52:34.879
It was a bad marriage.
Look how it ended up.

52:34.880 --> 52:37.359
Our father was a cheater,
and it drove our mother crazy.

52:37.360 --> 52:38.999
- Stop it.
- He snapped and he killed her.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.919
- He was gonna do the same to us.
- Yeah, a bad marriage.

52:40.920 --> 52:43.199
That explains how Mom had no
teeth, no hair, no mind left,

52:43.200 --> 52:46.439
by the time she died.
Yeah, a bad marriage.

52:46.440 --> 52:49.159
That explains those other people we
both saw in the house that last night.

52:49.160 --> 52:50.759
I don't remember doing that.

52:50.760 --> 52:53.639
Do you? You don't.

52:53.640 --> 52:55.839
The temperature in the room has
increased another two degrees

52:55.840 --> 52:57.279
to 78 degrees Fahrenheit...

52:57.280 --> 52:59.439
- but the alarms didn't go off...
- My phone.

52:59.440 --> 53:00.919
We've lost the ficus and
the blooming plants.

53:00.920 --> 53:02.559
- My phone.
- Which tells me that the dog

53:02.560 --> 53:04.559
provided at least enough
energy to bait the shark.

53:04.560 --> 53:05.959
I'd better call the doctor.

53:05.960 --> 53:07.919
Tim. If you're gonna
make a phone call,

53:07.920 --> 53:09.959
you need to do it outside
its radius of influence.

53:09.960 --> 53:13.759
Otherwise there's no way of knowing
who you're really talking to.

53:18.000 --> 53:20.959
Hello? Hi. Yeah.

53:20.960 --> 53:23.439
Everything's fine now.

53:23.440 --> 53:26.505
I'm sorry about earlier.
I'll talk to you in an hour.

53:28.840 --> 53:31.399
50/50 that was even him.

53:31.400 --> 53:33.668
We need to get out of
this room for a while.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.580
It must've gotten more from
the dog than I guessed.

53:43.920 --> 53:48.319
Its radius of influence
appears to be... 30 feet...

53:48.320 --> 53:50.959
which means we're still
good to go in the kitchen,

53:50.960 --> 53:54.119
laundry room, garage,
master bedroom,

53:54.120 --> 53:57.639
and the yard, front and back.
Oh, but I doubt for very long.

53:57.640 --> 53:59.783
Tim?

54:01.360 --> 54:02.946
Tim!

54:05.760 --> 54:07.999
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

54:08.000 --> 54:10.759
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

54:10.760 --> 54:13.559
Please check the
number and dial again.

54:13.560 --> 54:15.639
Your call cannot be
completed as dialed.

54:15.640 --> 54:18.279
Please check the
number and dial again.

54:18.280 --> 54:20.867
Tim.

54:22.240 --> 54:24.144
Tim.

54:28.840 --> 54:31.119
How did I get back in here?

54:31.120 --> 54:33.919
What do you mean? You walked
over here and you sat down.

54:33.920 --> 54:36.479
- I was outside.
- No, you weren't.

54:36.480 --> 54:37.999
Did you think you were?

54:38.000 --> 54:40.119
Would you mind saying
that on camera?

54:42.440 --> 54:44.439
Hey. Hey!

54:44.440 --> 54:47.505
It's because you're still here
that I know we're gonna win.

54:48.200 --> 54:50.184
Do you hear me?

54:50.880 --> 54:52.784
Do you understand?

55:35.360 --> 55:37.519
When's Daddy coming home?

55:37.520 --> 55:39.359
I don't know.

55:39.360 --> 55:41.519
You don't know when
Daddy's coming home?

55:41.520 --> 55:43.868
I don't know where he is.

55:44.880 --> 55:47.626
I know where he says he is.

55:56.760 --> 55:58.630
Kaylie.

56:01.920 --> 56:04.746
Tell me more about the
woman in the office.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.464
I haven't seen her.

56:19.200 --> 56:20.990
I have.

56:28.600 --> 56:30.345
When?

56:32.480 --> 56:34.111
Last night.

56:39.480 --> 56:41.987
She wasn't in the office.

56:43.320 --> 56:45.668
She was on the stairs.

56:48.280 --> 56:50.359
What was she doing?

56:50.360 --> 56:52.185
I didn't look.

56:52.920 --> 56:54.824
I was scared.

56:56.320 --> 56:59.510
But I think she went
back in the office.

57:00.680 --> 57:03.790
I think she lives there.

57:10.960 --> 57:13.706
You two go upstairs and play.

59:51.080 --> 59:52.620
Mom?

59:55.360 --> 59:56.839
Mom!

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.279
Tim!

01:00:27.280 --> 01:00:28.799
Mom!

01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:35.024
Go! Go, Tim!

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.589
Mommy, stop!

01:00:46.760 --> 01:00:50.079
Please stop, Mommy!

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.541
Marie?

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:54.343
Hey! Hey!

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.824
Baby?

01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:09.788
Sweetheart, you're bleeding.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.790
Baby?

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.704
Hey, hey, hey!

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:07.679
Sweetheart, you gotta
go back in your room.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.719
But, Mommy...

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.399
Your mother's fine.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.079
She's going to be all right.
Just, please, go back inside.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:16.303
Shut the door, OK, baby?

01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:19.911
Fuck.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:24.105
Fuck.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.101
Yeah, I have an
emergency with my wife.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.671
Everything is fine.

01:03:15.040 --> 01:03:17.679
- Is Mommy OK?
- Go to bed.

01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:36.151
Tim?

01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.864
Tim.

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:40.959
Snap out of it!

01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.639
Are you here?

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.146
Are you here with me?

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.711
Tim?

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:14.159
Guys, your mother
is very, very sick.

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:18.399
And, uh, she's gonna need to stay
in bed for a while, to rest up.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.359
So she can get better.

01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:23.266
But we don't want you
two bothering her.

01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:26.666
We?

01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.187
So, Champ, Princess...

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:36.279
we're gonna have to stay
clear of that room.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.150
Is that understood?

01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:42.782
What does she have?

01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:48.999
Now...

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:51.719
you are welcome to...

01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:56.150
hang out in here and
play video games.

01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:00.385
I thought you said we
weren't allowed in here.

01:05:09.920 --> 01:05:11.790
Eat.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.987
Come on, I need your help.

01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:40.661
Tim!

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.824
Tim, snap out of it!

01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:47.879
Tim!

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.503
Is that for Mom?

01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:14.910
Tim?

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:38.350
Nice.

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:39.308
Kaylie?

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:56.587
Maybe we should stay together.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:16.301
She still loves me!

01:08:39.680 --> 01:08:41.788
I'm hungry, Kaylie.

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:57.559
You need to go grocery
shopping, Dad.

01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:59.679
What's that, Princess?

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.711
- Food.
- That's on my list.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.879
The TV is out.

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.319
What's that, Princess?

01:09:08.319 --> 01:09:11.158
We need to call a doctor for Mom.

01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:13.064
That's on my list.

01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:34.959
This is stupid.

01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:37.238
I'm gonna tell her
we're out of food.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:39.861
- But Dad said...
- I don't care what Dad said.

01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.750
Mom?

01:10:48.480 --> 01:10:50.159
She needs a doctor!

01:10:50.160 --> 01:10:52.559
You told me she was
sick, but she's not...

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:55.239
You know what your problem is?
You don't listen!

01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:57.799
I told you not to go
into our room, didn't I?

01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.479
What do you do? You disobey me.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.199
Why?

01:11:01.200 --> 01:11:04.759
You disobeyed me, so
now you get grounded.

01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:07.399
You and your snot-nosed
little brother over there

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.759
are not to step foot
outside of this house.

01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.983
Now, get out of here.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:22.189
OK. Thank you.

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.185
Bye.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.425
What did the doctor say?

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.101
He said to have our father call.

01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:37.708
Like the last one.

01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:42.426
Exactly like the last one.

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.464
Same voice.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:11.159
Hi, Bob.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:13.359
I'm really sorry to hear that.

01:12:13.360 --> 01:12:15.119
I hope she gets better soon.

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:17.319
Thanks for that, Bob.

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:20.759
You know what? I'm just sorry she
brought you all the way over here.

01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.159
I mean, she's... you know, using
her mother's illness to act out.

01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:29.759
Wait till she starts driving.
This is nothing.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:32.279
Well, so sorry to bother you.

01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.679
I hope Marie is up and about soon.

01:12:34.680 --> 01:12:36.839
Thank you.

01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:38.879
Hey, you know what?
Give me a ring next week

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:41.759
and we'll play the front
nine at Arrowhead.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.799
Great. We'll do it.

01:12:43.800 --> 01:12:45.864
- See ya.
- Take care.

01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:14.279
Timbo.

01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:18.426
We're gonna have to get
really, really brave.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:03.343
Very clever.

01:14:05.360 --> 01:14:08.664
Tim!

01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:52.546
Kaylie?

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.159
And we've lost electric.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.985
Predictable.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:08.190
A dead plant.

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:49.430
It isn't real.

01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:01.599
Daddy?

01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:07.543
Could you fix the lights?

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:55.182
Nice tricks.

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.705
Kaylie...

01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:20.860
Oh, my God.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:25.265
Do you see him?

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:56.079
Hello?

01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:58.826
Just checking in, seeing
how everything's going.

01:18:03.160 --> 01:18:04.759
I'm fine.

01:18:04.760 --> 01:18:09.429
OK, I guess I'll talk to you
in an hour. Enjoyed the chat.

01:18:13.800 --> 01:18:15.829
That's a trick.

01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:20.679
I didn't kill him. I couldn't have.
The plate, it wasn't real.

01:18:20.680 --> 01:18:24.462
I didn't kill him because
the plate wasn't real!

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.639
Michael.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:06.466
What did I do? What did I do?

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.559
Come on. We're getting out of here.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.907
Come on, let's go.

01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:27.519
Hello?

01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:30.630
I need police and an ambulance.
2705 Hawthorne.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.679
OK, OK.

01:19:33.680 --> 01:19:36.439
Help is coming. They'll be here.
We'll straighten all this out.

01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:40.745
Kaylie, we're OK. We're OK.

01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.839
Michael, Michael, Michael.

01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.559
When was the last time you
reset the kitchen timer?

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:47.559
- I don't know.
- Your plan was solid.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.199
We don't have to do anything.

01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:50.839
All we have to do is
just sit here and wait.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:53.519
No more than half an hour.
Your kill switch.

01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:56.079
- You called for help?
- Yeah.

01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:58.064
We're done. It's over.

01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:01.559
We get to stand here and
watch that thing die.

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.239
It's a trick to get us back inside.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:30.305
What if this is a trick to
keep us standing there?

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.861
- I called for help.
- Call again.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:46.719
911. What's your emergency?

01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.439
Yeah, hi, I just called.
2705 Hawthorne.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:50.359
You're going to have to
have your father call.

01:20:50.360 --> 01:20:56.719
The doctor will be there tomorrow.

01:20:56.720 --> 01:20:58.704
Timbo...

01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.344
No!

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:07.429
What do we do?

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.559
We could do nothing. Just wait.

01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:14.319
And watch ourselves get...

01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:17.942
We're gonna have to get
really, really brave.

01:21:57.840 --> 01:22:00.984
He looked at the mirror
and took out a gun.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:08.223
We're gonna have to smash it.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.359
That's not real.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:40.947
I thought I told you not
to play around in here.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:43.510
It's not real.

01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:12.546
Shh!

01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:48.824
Kaylie?

01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:51.151
Is he gone?

01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.950
He was never here.

01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:00.319
It just herded us upstairs.

01:25:00.320 --> 01:25:04.359
We made the right call outside.
It's really trying to keep us away.

01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.199
It'll try harder. We
have to get downstairs

01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:09.279
- before that anchor swings.
- You have to make sure he's gone first.

01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:12.584
He's gone. I promise. See, he's...

01:25:54.560 --> 01:25:56.703
We've got to get downstairs.

01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:58.959
She's not gone.

01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:00.879
- I'm gonna open the door.
- No!

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.519
I'm gonna open the door.
If she's not gone...

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:06.822
I want you to run right
down the stairs.

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:11.707
- What are you gonna do?
- Don't worry about that. Just run.

01:26:16.320 --> 01:26:18.270
You ready?

01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:24.702
I'm gonna open the door. You
run right down the stairs.

01:26:26.720 --> 01:26:28.988
You trust me, right?

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.824
I trust you.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:40.719
One... I love you.

01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:43.944
Two... Straight for the stairs.

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:48.301
Three.

01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:07.509
It's not real.

01:28:16.520 --> 01:28:18.424
Just a trick.

01:28:20.680 --> 01:28:22.630
You're gonna arrest me, Timbo?

01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.830
Timbo?

01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:53.505
Tim!

01:29:17.960 --> 01:29:19.466
Tim?

01:29:43.680 --> 01:29:46.267
Mommy, please, no.

01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:27.180
Kaylie?

01:30:28.760 --> 01:30:30.949
Kaylie?

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:34.900
Mommy!

01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.025
Come on, Tim!

01:32:10.440 --> 01:32:14.439
It won't let us.

01:32:14.440 --> 01:32:17.346
I thought I told you not
to play around in here.

01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:28.986
No.

01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:32.104
This isn't you.

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.759
It is me.

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:38.799
I've met my demons,
and they are many.

01:32:38.800 --> 01:32:40.559
I've seen...

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.799
I've seen the devil...

01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.239
And he is...

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:45.951
and he is me.

01:32:52.640 --> 01:32:54.624
Dad!

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:02.510
Let her go!

01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.184
Run.

01:33:48.480 --> 01:33:50.703
No! No!

01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:52.799
Daddy!

01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:56.706
Come on.

01:34:14.200 --> 01:34:16.879
This isn't real! This isn't real!

01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:18.864
This isn't real!

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.749
Kaylie!

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:35.904
Kaylie!

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.105
Kaylie.

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:02.266
Mommy?

01:36:04.240 --> 01:36:07.066
Tim. Tim look at me.

01:36:08.840 --> 01:36:13.039
I want you to promise me, that
when we're big and we're strong,

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:15.519
we will make this right.

01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:23.742
We have to kill that thing.

01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:28.508
For Mom and Dad.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:34.308
I promise.

01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:47.705
Kaylie?

01:36:48.920 --> 01:36:50.745
Kaylie?

01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:56.182
Kaylie! Kaylie! Kaylie!

01:36:57.040 --> 01:37:02.079
Kaylie! Kaylie! Kaylie!

01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:36.599
He called it in?

01:37:36.600 --> 01:37:40.950
Yeah, he called 911,
and then he did this.

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:48.944
Where are you taking me?

01:37:50.080 --> 01:37:52.279
No, it wasn't my fault!

01:37:52.280 --> 01:37:54.479
- It was the mirror!
- Tim!

01:37:54.480 --> 01:37:57.759
Wait! Stop! It wasn't me!

01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:01.439
It wasn't me. It was the
mirror! It was the mirror!

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:03.359
Please! Please! You
have to believe me!

01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.584
It was the mirror!
It was the mirror!

01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:10.759
Please!

01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:13.159
Hey! Hey!

01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.759
Don't forget!

01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.903
Don't forget our promise!

01:38:19.360 --> 01:38:21.344
Don't forget.

01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.061
TCS Subtitling.
