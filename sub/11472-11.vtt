WEBVTT

00:06.472 --> 00:08.742
Hey, um...

00:08.775 --> 00:10.711
My friend
was wondering, uh...

00:10.744 --> 00:13.346
If I gave you a joint,
would you have sex
with me?

00:13.680 --> 00:15.616
What?

00:15.649 --> 00:17.183
I can't believe
you did it.

00:23.690 --> 00:24.725
Lindsay!

00:24.758 --> 00:26.760
Hey!
Hey, guess what?

00:26.793 --> 00:28.161
We got a gig.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.864
Yeah. Stroker's
brother's gonna let us
play at his party.

00:30.897 --> 00:31.998
Uh, he's even
gonna loan us

00:32.032 --> 00:34.334
a Marshall stack
and a Peavey
bass cabinet.

00:34.367 --> 00:35.569
It's, like,
total pro equipment.

00:35.602 --> 00:37.704
Yeah. We're gonna blow
the roof off his garage

00:37.738 --> 00:39.906
in a most rock‐tagious way.

00:39.940 --> 00:41.575
Wow. That's really
great, you guys.

00:41.608 --> 00:44.578
So we just need your
parents' station wagon
to pick up the amps.

00:44.611 --> 00:48.014
What? You guys
can't use
my parent's car.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.382
They're insane
about it.

00:49.415 --> 00:51.451
My dad even calls it Betty.

00:51.484 --> 00:53.353
Lindsay, please.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.421
I mean, we need
to get those amps.
Don't be lame.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.991
I'm not being lame,
Daniel.

00:58.024 --> 00:59.292
My parents are
never gonna let us

00:59.325 --> 01:00.727
borrow their station wagon.

01:01.695 --> 01:02.863
Well, didn't you say

01:02.896 --> 01:05.265
that your mom plays
bridge or something
on Tuesdays?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.467
Yeah, so?

01:07.501 --> 01:10.871
So, she won't
even know it's gone.
Just grab the keys.

01:10.904 --> 01:12.839
We'll be back
before she finishes
the first hand.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.474
I don't know.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.243
Oh! Squirrel!

01:17.277 --> 01:19.546
KIM: Lindsay, whoa!
Jeez, my neck!

01:19.580 --> 01:21.948
Just run over
the stupid squirrel,
Linze.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.016
LINDSAY: Aw.

01:23.049 --> 01:24.785
Lindsay, you are
a terrible driver.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.587
Shut up, Daniel.

01:26.620 --> 01:27.487
You are.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.222
LINDSAY: How far
is this place, Japan?

01:29.255 --> 01:30.891
No. We're almost there.
It's on the next block.

01:30.924 --> 01:31.958
No, Daniel, I told you.

01:31.992 --> 01:33.660
It's not on Hancock.
It's on Warren.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.196
DANIEL: It's on Hancock.
I was just there.

01:36.229 --> 01:37.998
Hey, could you put
on some real music?

01:38.031 --> 01:39.700
I hate
this new wave crap.

01:39.733 --> 01:42.068
No. No. Leave it on, man.
That's Joe Jackson.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.637
His bass player's
unbelievable, man.

01:43.670 --> 01:46.239
Hey, there's
Valerie's house, you guys!

01:46.272 --> 01:47.974
You guys, I'm telling you,
we're going the wrong way.

01:48.008 --> 01:49.109
No, we're not.

01:49.142 --> 01:51.512
Lindsay, please drive
like a normal person.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.446
I am driving nice.

01:53.479 --> 01:56.249
Yeah. Yeah.
Roll down the windows

01:56.282 --> 01:58.785
'cause I got
a big one a‐brewing.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.053
Oh, no. Please don't.

02:00.086 --> 02:02.388
Ew. Ken, you better not.

02:02.422 --> 02:04.057
KEN: It's coming!
LINDSAY: Ew!

02:04.090 --> 02:06.259
Those Miller farts
are unbelievable.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.961
Lindsay, that's it!

02:07.994 --> 02:09.796
That's the house
over there! Right there!

02:09.830 --> 02:11.397
LINDSAY: Where?
Watch out!

02:12.132 --> 02:13.700
Oh, my God!

02:28.148 --> 02:30.517
Oh, my God.

03:22.268 --> 03:24.671
I can't believe
I forgot my math book.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.040
I hate being in school
after it's out.

03:27.073 --> 03:28.942
Makes me feel
like a janitor.

03:28.975 --> 03:30.343
Janitors are cool.

03:30.376 --> 03:31.678
I'd like to be a janitor.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.314
Why? So you can show up
with the red sawdust

03:34.347 --> 03:35.849
after a kid throws up?

03:35.882 --> 03:38.451
No. 'Cause janitors make
way more than teachers.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.987
It makes up for all that
gross stuff they have to do.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.556
TODD: Why?
CINDY: Oh, you.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.358
Because I'm a girl.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.360
TODD: Come on,
girls can call guys.

03:47.393 --> 03:49.162
Girls do not call guys.

03:49.195 --> 03:50.230
Sure, they do.

03:50.263 --> 03:53.133
No, they don't.
Come on.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.235
What's so great
about him anyway?

03:55.268 --> 03:56.603
It's the hair.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.272
SAM: Oh, come on.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.007
She likes him
because of his hair?

04:01.041 --> 04:04.210
Of course. He's got
the feathered thing
going.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.179
Girls love that.

04:06.212 --> 04:07.814
Yeah. All the men
my mom dates

04:07.848 --> 04:09.249
have feathered hair.

04:09.282 --> 04:11.151
I heard her talking
to her girlfriends.

04:11.184 --> 04:14.387
She said any guy with
feathered hair is foxy.

04:14.988 --> 04:16.590
SAM: But it's just hair.

04:16.623 --> 04:20.260
I mean, why would girls
care how you comb it?

04:20.293 --> 04:21.461
That's women.

04:21.494 --> 04:24.264
They get turned on
by weird stuff.

04:24.297 --> 04:26.332
My God,
look at my car!

04:26.366 --> 04:27.534
What were you doing?

04:27.568 --> 04:28.935
What were you
thinking about?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.904
I am so, so sorry.

04:30.937 --> 04:33.006
What is wrong with you?
Didn't you see me
pulling out of the driveway?

04:33.039 --> 04:35.108
Hey, lady,
she said she was sorry.

04:35.141 --> 04:36.710
You know, we're all
a little upset here.

04:36.743 --> 04:38.679
Don't talk to me now.
Do not talk to me.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.413
Barbara, could you
call the police?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.482
The police?
Come on, lady!

04:42.516 --> 04:44.117
Calm the hell down,
all right?

04:44.150 --> 04:45.485
Kim, knock it off!

04:45.519 --> 04:47.521
God, this is
all your fault!

04:47.554 --> 04:50.524
What? Lindsay,
how is this my fault?

04:50.557 --> 04:52.258
Oh. "That's the house!"
That's when you were...

04:52.292 --> 04:54.360
Hey, hey, hey, guys!

04:54.394 --> 04:55.896
Take it easy.

04:55.929 --> 04:57.363
It's both your faults.

04:57.397 --> 04:58.732
What? This is not
my fault, Daniel.

04:58.765 --> 05:00.701
You're the one who
talked me into this.

05:00.734 --> 05:02.202
I didn't talk you
into anything.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.872
Do you have any idea
how much trouble
I am gonna be in?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.842
You are gonna pay
for every last cent of
this damage, young lady.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.277
Hey, lady.
There's something you
might not have heard of.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.713
It's called insurance.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.381
Oh, please. You just
stay away from me.
Just stay away.

05:15.415 --> 05:19.085
Yeah. Who wants to
be near you anyways.
You're too sexy.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.421
Oh, please. Oh, man.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.056
(DANIEL MOANS)

05:30.531 --> 05:33.734
I could call the police.
You know that?

05:35.536 --> 05:36.770
I could call the police

05:36.803 --> 05:39.940
and report this
as grand theft auto.

05:41.875 --> 05:44.044
I can send
my own daughter to jail.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.078
You know that?

05:49.415 --> 05:51.518
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

05:54.320 --> 05:55.756
You know what?

05:57.758 --> 06:00.426
I don't think
I believe anything
you say anymore.

06:02.062 --> 06:03.063
Why should I?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.834
You're grounded.

06:07.868 --> 06:09.770
I can't even tell you
for how long.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.440
You'll be coming home
from school every day

06:14.474 --> 06:16.109
and sitting
in your room.

06:17.443 --> 06:19.813
No stereo, no radio,

06:20.413 --> 06:23.083
no TV, no telephone,

06:23.116 --> 06:24.651
nothing.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.891
And you are not
to hang out

06:30.924 --> 06:33.827
with those burnt‐out
friends of yours...

06:33.860 --> 06:35.361
Ever again.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.130
Ever!

06:37.163 --> 06:38.699
Do you hear me?

06:39.465 --> 06:40.834
Don't worry.

06:40.867 --> 06:42.569
(SIGHS) I won't.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.672
You'd better not.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.881
Hey, Lindsay.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.620
I saw the smashed car
in your driveway.

06:59.653 --> 07:01.888
Just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

07:11.131 --> 07:12.332
Are you okay, Lindsay?

07:12.365 --> 07:13.900
Yeah.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.136
No.

07:17.838 --> 07:19.806
It was so terrible,
Millie.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.576
It just didn't sound like
anything you've ever heard.

07:22.609 --> 07:24.711
It was just this thud.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.548
It was so scary.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.852
Who was in the car
with you?

07:32.553 --> 07:34.054
Who do you think?

07:37.357 --> 07:38.759
Sorry, Lindsay.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.062
If you want,
I can go get my Uno deck.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.098
No. I'm fine.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.536
Did you hear what happened
at the mathlete scrimmage

07:49.570 --> 07:51.337
against North Lake?

07:51.371 --> 07:52.873
Katie got so nervous

07:52.906 --> 07:54.307
when she went up
to do her round

07:54.340 --> 07:55.709
that she got
a bloody nose.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.644
And then,
she didn't know it.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.013
She had to sneeze,
and she blew blood
all over the place.

08:00.046 --> 08:03.183
(LAUGHS) She looked down,
and she saw it on her shirt,

08:03.216 --> 08:05.085
and she fainted.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.486
Uh‐uh.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.622
No, she didn't.

08:08.655 --> 08:11.024
Well, no, but...

08:12.158 --> 08:13.493
She was gonna.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.697
It was pretty funny.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.637
So, how's the team
doing this year?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.507
They, uh...
It's been cool.

08:26.540 --> 08:29.009
Not as fun as last year.

08:30.210 --> 08:31.778
I really miss you,
Lindsay.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.247
All the mathletes do.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.733
Oh, man.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.236
How am I gonna get this on
without messing up my hair?

08:56.269 --> 08:57.904
(RIPS)

09:02.242 --> 09:03.243
Man!

09:17.524 --> 09:20.627
Boy, I can just imagine
how much those pirates
are gonna charge me.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.196
Just pretend you know
a lot about cars.

09:23.229 --> 09:24.464
But I don't.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.267
They can smell it,
the bloodsuckers.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.669
Yeah...

09:29.536 --> 09:30.804
What's the matter?

09:36.009 --> 09:38.945
Lindsay,
you want some bacon?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.413
No, thanks, Mom.

09:40.446 --> 09:41.948
I'm just gonna
have some juice.

09:50.123 --> 09:51.491
Oh, my goodness.

09:51.525 --> 09:53.159
What?

09:53.193 --> 09:54.494
Sam.

09:54.528 --> 09:55.729
Hey, Dad.

09:55.762 --> 09:57.564
Sammy, you look
so handsome.

09:57.598 --> 09:59.900
Just like one
of the Hardy Boys.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.334
Thanks.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.869
Hey, Sam, wait up.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.906
Bye, Mom.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.708
Bye, Dad.

10:12.546 --> 10:14.180
Wow.

10:23.557 --> 10:24.725
My goodness.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.459
Don't the Weirs
look nice today?

10:26.492 --> 10:27.928
BOTH: Thank you.

10:29.362 --> 10:30.531
See you.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.098
See you, Sam.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.805
What, did you just
come from church?

10:38.839 --> 10:40.707
So, how'd things
go with your dad?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.609
Was he pissed?

10:42.643 --> 10:44.177
No. Not at all.

10:44.210 --> 10:47.581
He was really happy
that I stole his car
and smashed it.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.583
Hey, if it makes
you feel any better,

10:49.616 --> 10:51.351
the party got
moved till tonight.

10:51.384 --> 10:52.653
You know what,
Daniel?

10:52.686 --> 10:54.320
That doesn't make me
feel any better

10:54.354 --> 10:55.722
'cause now I'm grounded,

10:55.756 --> 10:58.391
So I can't go to any of
your stupid parties, ever.

10:58.424 --> 10:59.926
Why don't you just
sneak out?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.095
Why don't you
just go to hell?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.597
Whoa.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.031
God, Lindsay.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.833
Oh, shut up, Kim!

11:06.867 --> 11:08.969
I'm sick of you guys
getting me in trouble
all the time.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.737
I'm sick of you guys,
period.

11:11.572 --> 11:13.540
Maybe you're just
on your period.

11:13.574 --> 11:15.075
(KEN LAUGHS)

11:15.108 --> 11:19.179
Yeah, Daniel,
that's exactly it.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.681
I'm on my period.

11:20.714 --> 11:22.415
You figured it out.

11:22.448 --> 11:24.084
It was a joke.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.719
Oh, sorry.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.121
It's hard to pick up
on the subtlety
of your wit.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.258
What's up your butt,
princess?

11:32.292 --> 11:33.594
You are, Daniel!

11:33.627 --> 11:35.428
I'm tired of you using me.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.963
You're the most
selfish people

11:36.997 --> 11:38.665
I've ever met in my life.

11:38.699 --> 11:41.001
Look, I know you don't care
about being smart

11:41.034 --> 11:43.403
or going to school
or anything else,

11:43.436 --> 11:45.806
but just because your lives
are such lost causes,

11:45.839 --> 11:48.074
don't keep assuming
that mine is.

11:51.477 --> 11:52.813
What was that
all about?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.314
I don't know,

11:54.347 --> 11:56.016
but it was
pretty funny.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.350
Shut up.

12:01.321 --> 12:04.024
You know, who asked her to
hang out with us anyways?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.793
Like we need
her little judgments
all the time.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.295
My life ain't
a lost cause,
you know?

12:09.329 --> 12:10.731
Hers is.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.165
She's just a big baby.

12:12.198 --> 12:13.834
I told you guys that
from day one.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.002
It's like hanging out
with my grandma.

12:16.036 --> 12:18.772
Yeah. Well,
Little Miss Perfect
doesn't know

12:18.805 --> 12:20.707
what I'm gonna do
with my life.

12:20.741 --> 12:22.442
She doesn't know
what my plans are.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.345
What the hell
are your plans?

12:25.378 --> 12:26.780
I got a lot of plans.

12:28.281 --> 12:29.249
Like?

12:29.282 --> 12:31.585
Who are you,
my guidance counselor?

12:31.618 --> 12:33.153
What are you gonna do?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.689
I'm gonna wait
for my dad to die

12:35.722 --> 12:37.257
so I inherit his company.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.193
Then I'm gonna sell it
and move to Hawaii.

12:40.226 --> 12:41.995
Great plan.

12:42.028 --> 12:44.430
I don't hear
anything better
coming out of you.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.866
Well...

12:45.899 --> 12:48.702
I'm gonna be, like,
a lawyer or something.

12:48.735 --> 12:50.804
I'm gonna put
the police on trial.

12:50.837 --> 12:53.373
I'm gonna get guys
out of jail and stuff.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.275
You know?

12:55.308 --> 12:58.144
Yeah. Maybe you can
break Daniel
out of there.

12:58.178 --> 13:00.514
Screw you, man.
I'm not going to jail.

13:00.547 --> 13:02.382
Okay.
What will you be doing?

13:03.483 --> 13:04.885
Plenty.

13:04.918 --> 13:07.020
Now if you're done
grilling me, Mr. Rosso,

13:07.053 --> 13:10.023
why don't you give me
a dollar so I can get
some Sno‐Balls?

13:10.056 --> 13:11.558
Okay.

13:15.862 --> 13:17.598
You guys,
I'm telling you,

13:17.631 --> 13:19.399
this... It's not
about the accident.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.203
Lindsay's really depressed
that I broke up with her.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.806
She's got to get over it
though, you know?

13:26.272 --> 13:28.675
Yeah, Nick. Sure.

13:28.709 --> 13:30.210
So, I guess
you're gonna be, like,

13:30.243 --> 13:32.579
a psychiatrist
or something.

13:32.613 --> 13:36.550
No. I'm gonna
be a deejay, man.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.422
And maybe,
um, a lumberjack.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.665
The name of the company
is Texas Instruments,

13:51.698 --> 13:54.601
but I heard
it's made in Taiwan.

13:54.635 --> 13:56.369
Hey.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.804
Is it okay
if I sit here?

13:57.838 --> 14:00.173
Yeah. Sit down,
Lindsay.

14:00.206 --> 14:01.307
Hi, Carey.

14:01.341 --> 14:02.375
Hi.

14:02.408 --> 14:03.910
Hi, Erin.
Hi.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.979
Look, Lindsay.
Erin got a new calculator.

14:06.012 --> 14:07.548
It graphs and everything.

14:07.581 --> 14:09.149
I got it
for my birthday.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.483
That's cool.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.018
Can I see it?
ERIN: Yeah.

14:17.323 --> 14:18.825
Do you have
a calculator, Lindsay?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.294
No. My dad
won't buy me one.

14:21.327 --> 14:24.731
He says Einstein did fine
without one and so should I.

14:24.765 --> 14:26.099
You don't need one,
Lindsay.

14:26.132 --> 14:27.233
Yeah.
Remember that judge

14:27.267 --> 14:28.835
at the intra‐districts
last year?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.737
He called you
the human calculator.

14:30.771 --> 14:32.238
Oh, yeah.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.540
MILLIE: I think
he had a crush on you.

14:33.574 --> 14:36.376
What?
Ew, he was, like,
40 years old.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.244
That's so gross.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.212
Hey, Lindsay,

14:39.245 --> 14:41.414
I'm having a slumber
party Friday night.

14:41.447 --> 14:44.017
All the mathletes
are gonna be there.
You wanna go?

14:44.585 --> 14:46.286
Well...

14:46.319 --> 14:48.522
Yeah, I would,
but I'm grounded.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.757
Oh, yeah.

14:50.791 --> 14:52.659
Well, you should
ask your dad.

14:52.693 --> 14:54.060
It's just across the street.

14:54.094 --> 14:55.529
It's gonna be
a lot of fun.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.298
Yeah? Maybe.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.967
Well, it's
an interesting look,
Sam.

15:01.001 --> 15:04.004
Naw. Your hair's not long
enough to be feathered.

15:04.037 --> 15:07.407
I think it looks weird,
like you're trying to be
all fancy or something.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.076
I don't think
you should worry
with how you look, Sam.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.012
My mom always says
that you should be happy

15:12.045 --> 15:13.346
with what the good
Lord gave you.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.816
Well, the good Lord
gave you a lot, Gordon.

15:15.849 --> 15:17.250
NEAL AND SAM: Bill!

15:17.283 --> 15:19.786
My whole family's big‐boned.
It's genetic.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.788
Besides, the world
loves jolly fat guys.

15:21.822 --> 15:23.924
Burl Ives,
Jackie Gleason...

15:23.957 --> 15:26.993
Santa Claus,
uh, Curly, Raymond Burr.

15:27.027 --> 15:29.896
No. Raymond Burr's
not jolly.

15:29.930 --> 15:33.066
Well, he was
extremely nice to me
at last year's Auto Show.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.402
Hey.

15:36.436 --> 15:39.039
Do any of you guys have
a pencil I could borrow?

15:39.072 --> 15:41.875
Oh, hey, Cindy.
How's it going?

15:41.908 --> 15:44.611
It's okay.
Today in chemistry,

15:44.645 --> 15:45.946
I sat on a piece
of chocolate

15:45.979 --> 15:48.281
and had to go home
and change my pants.

15:48.314 --> 15:50.450
Oh. Yeah.

15:52.953 --> 15:54.454
Sam, did you
wear a hat today?

15:54.487 --> 15:56.289
Because your hair
looks kind of flat.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.659
Got one.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.093
CINDY: Thanks.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.595
I'll bring it
right back.

16:01.628 --> 16:02.963
You better.

16:07.601 --> 16:09.503
Oh, man.

16:09.536 --> 16:11.171
You can't just comb
your hair different

16:11.204 --> 16:12.939
and expect Cindy
to start liking you.

16:12.973 --> 16:14.975
You have to
dress different, too.

16:15.008 --> 16:16.342
I dress okay.

16:16.376 --> 16:18.712
Sam, you look like
your mother dresses you.

16:18.745 --> 16:20.313
(SCOFFS)

16:20.346 --> 16:23.584
Hey, well, at least
I don't dress like
a ventriloquist's dummy.

16:23.617 --> 16:25.085
Don't kill
the messenger.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.286
I know I look good.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.855
I dress well, and I
groom myself properly.

16:28.889 --> 16:30.156
Look around.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.425
The whole school dresses
better than you do.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.236
Change your clothes,
change your life.

16:45.906 --> 16:47.107
Pirates.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.709
We live right
outside Detroit,

16:48.742 --> 16:50.376
and they can't
find a fender?

16:50.410 --> 16:52.345
Now I get two weeks
of driving around town

16:52.378 --> 16:54.047
looking like
some kind of hillbilly.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.449
Hey, Dad,
can I borrow some money?

16:56.482 --> 16:57.417
Hmm?

16:57.450 --> 17:00.120
Uh, I wanna buy some
new clothes tomorrow.

17:00.153 --> 17:01.988
Oh, Sammy, I'll
take you to the mall.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.389
We'll use
my credit cards.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.792
And then we can
go to Magic Pan
and get crepes...

17:05.826 --> 17:08.862
Oh, no. Mom!
You always get me
something stupid,

17:08.895 --> 17:10.664
like Garanimals
or something like that.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.298
I wanna buy my own clothes.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.267
HAROLD: Good idea, Sam.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.537
A man has to learn
to dress himself.

17:16.570 --> 17:19.139
You know, you got
to cut those
apron strings sometime.

17:23.276 --> 17:24.377
Dad?

17:25.512 --> 17:27.548
I was thinking of going
back to the mathletes...

17:27.581 --> 17:30.350
And I'll have to stay
after school for practice.
Is that okay?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.355
LINDSAY: Dad?

17:36.857 --> 17:39.560
Well, yeah.
I suppose it would be okay.

17:39.593 --> 17:42.295
But if this
is some kind of ploy,
then heaven help you.

17:42.328 --> 17:44.665
It's not a ploy
and thanks.

17:46.366 --> 17:47.668
Okay.

17:49.035 --> 17:50.604
Okay. What's the gag?

17:50.637 --> 17:51.905
There is no gag.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.640
I thought you wanted me
back on the team.

17:53.674 --> 17:56.943
I'd love to have you
back on the team
if you're serious.

17:56.977 --> 17:58.612
I'm serious.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.446
That's great.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.248
There's just one problem,
Lindsay.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.585
I'm gonna have to
put you in the reserves.

18:04.618 --> 18:05.819
Really?

18:05.852 --> 18:07.153
Aren't there
any open blocks?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.122
No. It's a big team
this year.

18:09.155 --> 18:12.192
Look, why don't you start
coming to practices
until you get caught up,

18:12.225 --> 18:14.394
and maybe
in a couple of weeks,

18:14.427 --> 18:15.929
we'll see
what we can do.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.397
All right?

18:17.430 --> 18:18.999
Yeah. Okay.

18:19.032 --> 18:20.366
All right.

18:20.901 --> 18:22.168
(BELL RINGS)

18:22.202 --> 18:24.404
I got to go to class.

18:24.437 --> 18:27.340
No. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

18:27.373 --> 18:29.342
Dez gave me
the keys to his place.

18:29.375 --> 18:32.345
We'll go earn some
extra biology credit.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.617
What's your problem?

18:36.650 --> 18:39.520
I told you.
I have to go to class.

18:40.020 --> 18:41.822
Oh. Okay, Lindsay.

18:42.823 --> 18:44.958
You know what?
Shut up, man!

18:44.991 --> 18:47.661
I thought you were
the guy that had
all these big plans.

18:47.694 --> 18:51.064
Yeah. I went to all
my classes yesterday.

18:51.097 --> 18:53.734
I could
barely stay awake.

18:53.767 --> 18:57.738
Then drink a cup of coffee
and get it together, Daniel.

18:57.771 --> 18:59.305
I'm out of here.

19:22.829 --> 19:25.999
So, Carl Sagan says,
"That's not a cosine.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.869
"You don't know your
asymptote from a hole
in the ground."

19:28.902 --> 19:30.436
(LAUGHING)

19:30.470 --> 19:33.206
Oh, hi, Lindsay.
Hey, Shelly.

19:33.239 --> 19:35.041
I hear that
you have to be
on the reserves.

19:35.075 --> 19:36.777
That's too bad.

19:36.810 --> 19:40.380
You know, Shelly,
if you give up
first block,

19:40.413 --> 19:42.516
then Lindsay could
have her spot back
on the team.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.717
Millie.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.451
Just kidding.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.487
Don't kid
about first block.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.756
(NERVOUS GIGGLE)
Sorry.

19:49.790 --> 19:52.458
You know, M. I. T. looks
way more carefully
at your application

19:52.492 --> 19:54.460
if you've been
a first block.

19:54.494 --> 19:57.263
I just can't believe
that you would give up
being first block

19:57.297 --> 19:58.832
just to hang out
with freaks.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.767
God, Shelly!

20:01.735 --> 20:05.071
It's true! I'm not
putting her down.

20:05.105 --> 20:08.609
I mean, they're the ones
who made her get into
that car accident.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.744
I bet you
they were all high.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.247
Nobody was high.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.151
Oh. Was that
Kim girl with you?

20:18.184 --> 20:20.353
She's pregnant,
you know.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.955
My neighbor works
at the free clinic,

20:21.988 --> 20:26.126
and he said that he saw her
over there the other day.

20:26.159 --> 20:29.395
Just because a girl
chooses to live her life
differently than you do

20:29.429 --> 20:31.865
doesn't mean
she's automatically
barefoot and pregnant.

20:32.966 --> 20:35.301
I didn't say
she was barefoot.

20:36.002 --> 20:38.071
I mean,
don't get all mad.

20:38.104 --> 20:40.306
Anyway, you know her
better than I do.

20:43.476 --> 20:46.412
Mr. Kowchevski,
I want you to make me
first block.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.649
Nice to see you, too!

20:48.682 --> 20:50.651
Look, at least put me
back on the team.

20:50.684 --> 20:52.953
I am the best person
at math in this school.

20:52.986 --> 20:56.557
Well, actually, I think
that I'm the best person
at math in this school.

20:57.157 --> 20:58.424
Okay.

20:58.458 --> 21:01.494
But, come on,
let's cut the crap,
Kowchevski.

21:02.596 --> 21:05.666
(SIGHS) Okay.
You're right, Lindsay,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.634
The team needs you
desperately. I mean,

21:07.668 --> 21:10.637
if it wasn't for Shelly,
we'd be in the toilet.

21:10.671 --> 21:13.006
I cannot bounce anyone
from this team.

21:13.039 --> 21:16.710
They've been coming
every day, Lindsay,
it wouldn't be fair.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.412
This is the mathletes,
not the football team.

21:19.445 --> 21:22.415
What is the difference?
It's still a team.

21:22.448 --> 21:23.717
So if you're
gonna have a team,

21:23.750 --> 21:25.418
you might as well
have a winning one.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.788
Otherwise, what the hell
is the point of competing?

eat in here.

21:51.545 --> 21:53.947

throw it away.

Well, I can't have
you getting mustard
all over our garments.

21:57.584 --> 21:59.786
Yeah, maybe you
should wait outside.

No, no, no.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.093
There. All gone.

22:07.127 --> 22:10.931
Excellent. Well, uh,
what can I help you gents
out with today?

22:12.198 --> 22:15.836
Yeah, uh, I wanna
buy some new clothes.

22:15.869 --> 22:18.371

make me look like

22:18.404 --> 22:20.641

kid in school.

22:20.674 --> 22:23.076
Well, I've got
a question for you.

22:23.109 --> 22:24.545
You wanna be a stud,

22:24.578 --> 22:26.747
or do you wanna be
a super stud?

22:28.414 --> 22:30.751
Super stud, Sam.
Go for super stud.

22:32.085 --> 22:34.120
All right, then.

trendsetting guy

gonna own one.

Wow.

Really is right.

and I guarantee

22:59.279 --> 23:03.083

as a man of distinction
by the ladies.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.625
You know, I'm not
a handsome man,

23:11.658 --> 23:13.493
but I learned how
to style my hair,

23:13.527 --> 23:15.596
started wearing
some of these clothes.

23:16.897 --> 23:18.498
It's been pretty cool.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.403
All right, gang.
I've had to make
some tough decisions

23:23.436 --> 23:25.371
about who's gonna
be competing tomorrow,

23:25.405 --> 23:27.508
and some of you
are not gonna like that.

23:29.676 --> 23:32.646
Lindsay,
you're on the team.

23:32.679 --> 23:36.316
She rejoins and gets
into competition
in one day?

23:36.349 --> 23:37.518
That's not fair!

23:37.551 --> 23:39.252
No, Shelly,
it's not fair,

23:39.285 --> 23:41.087
but if we lose
against Lincoln tomorrow,

23:41.121 --> 23:43.389
we're gonna blow
our home advantage
for the rest of the year.

23:43.423 --> 23:45.692
This is just
a little insurance.

23:46.660 --> 23:48.461
Well, then, who's
gonna get bumped?

23:48.494 --> 23:50.463
Well, that's strictly
a decision based

23:50.496 --> 23:52.198
on the last few
practices.

23:53.667 --> 23:56.202
Millie, would you mind
sitting out tomorrow?

23:57.671 --> 23:58.739
Oh.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.543
No, Mr. Kowchevski.

24:02.576 --> 24:04.177
That's fine.
I don't mind.

24:04.210 --> 24:06.446
No, Mr. Kowchevski,
I don't think
Millie should...

24:06.479 --> 24:08.515
No, Lindsay.
That's cool.

24:08.549 --> 24:09.983
The team really
needs you.

24:10.016 --> 24:11.284
No, we don't!

24:11.317 --> 24:12.586
This is completely
unfair to you, Millie.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.920

Shelly.

to all of us!

own business!

for tomorrow's
scrimmage.

the last chopper
out of Saigon,

24:25.165 --> 24:28.468

crank down the drama
a notch, okay?

get outta here.

Jeez, Millie,
don't you ever
clean your room?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.525
I just did.

25:24.558 --> 25:25.959
I'm really glad
Mr. Kowchevski

25:25.992 --> 25:27.561
kicked me off the team
so you can be on it.

25:27.594 --> 25:28.995
He didn't kick you
off the team, Millie.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.697
He just put you
on the reserves.

25:30.731 --> 25:32.933
Yeah, I know.
Don't worry.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.303
How much does Shelly
know about trig?

25:37.337 --> 25:38.471
Is she good at it?

25:38.505 --> 25:39.773
I think so.

25:39.806 --> 25:41.241
We don't have
too many trig questions.

25:41.274 --> 25:44.611
Yeah, but when you do,
does she get 'em right?

25:45.378 --> 25:46.880
I don't know.
I forget.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.082
Millie!
Come on, think!

25:49.115 --> 25:50.551
If I'm gonna blow Shelly
out of the water,

25:50.584 --> 25:51.952
I gotta know
this stuff.

25:51.985 --> 25:54.054
Think Mr. Kowchevski'll
move you to first block?

25:54.087 --> 25:56.322
He'd better.
If I'm gonna be
on the mathletes,

25:56.356 --> 25:59.560
I'm gonna be
number one, or else
I'm not gonna do it.

for the scrimmage.

been studying nonstop.

a little break?

Not if I wanna win.

is more to life
than competition.

to wipe out

31:20.847 --> 31:22.348
You're dad's 65?

31:22.382 --> 31:24.117
Seventy now.

31:24.150 --> 31:25.819
When I'm 45
he'll be 100.

31:25.852 --> 31:27.888
(LAUGHS)

31:31.157 --> 31:33.193
You know, you're
a pretty interesting
guy, Harris.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.296
Yeah, I mean, you
do your own thing.

31:37.263 --> 31:38.999
You're comfortable
with yourself.

31:40.601 --> 31:42.035
You got it
pretty wired, huh?

31:42.803 --> 31:44.337
Yeah, I guess I do.

31:45.706 --> 31:47.107
I don't have sex,
though.

31:49.042 --> 31:51.211
Okay, people, listen up.
Let's not get cocky

31:51.244 --> 31:52.879
just 'cause we have
the home‐field advantage.

31:52.913 --> 31:54.247
Now you all know your stuff,

31:54.280 --> 31:57.283
so just stay clearheaded,
and we blaze through this.

31:57.317 --> 31:59.620
Now let's go kick
some Lincoln butt!

31:59.653 --> 32:00.821
EVERYBODY: (SOFTLY) Yeah!

32:00.854 --> 32:02.088
Come on! Let's go.

32:07.828 --> 32:09.462
Good luck,
everybody.

32:09.495 --> 32:10.731
Good luck,
Shelly.

32:10.764 --> 32:12.365
Thanks.
Same to you.

32:14.100 --> 32:15.636
Good luck, Lindsay.

32:15.669 --> 32:17.303
Even though I know
you don't need it.

32:18.071 --> 32:19.439
(WHISPERING)
Go, first block!

32:45.198 --> 32:46.299
Nick?

32:47.233 --> 32:49.202
Oh, what are
you doing here?

32:49.870 --> 32:51.204
What are
you doing here?

32:52.105 --> 32:54.675
I was just, um,
killing some time.

32:57.678 --> 32:59.079
All right,
I gotta get going.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.386
Mrs. Amendella?

33:06.419 --> 33:09.455
Hi, it's Sam
from next door.

33:09.489 --> 33:12.158
Yeah, my mom's
not home. Do you
know where she is?

33:13.326 --> 33:14.728
Oh, okay.

33:14.761 --> 33:16.362
All right, well,
I'm at McKinley.

33:16.396 --> 33:18.198
You think you
could pick me up?

33:19.700 --> 33:23.069
'Scuse me. Aren't
you Deney Terrio
from <i>Dance Fever?</i>

33:23.103 --> 33:25.906
No, I told you,
it's Chrissy
from <i>Three's Company.</i>

33:25.939 --> 33:27.107
(LAUGHING)

33:27.140 --> 33:28.308
What do you want,
Alan?

33:28.341 --> 33:30.010
I just wanna
know something.

33:30.043 --> 33:31.612
Exactly how queer
are you?

33:31.645 --> 33:32.879
Shut up.

33:32.913 --> 33:34.280
No, really,
really, I'm serious.

33:34.314 --> 33:35.749
You know, just
when I think

33:35.782 --> 33:37.851
he's as queer
as he can be,

33:37.884 --> 33:40.854
you go and do
something even
queerer.

33:40.887 --> 33:43.023
Let me alone, Alan!
I'm sick of you!

33:43.056 --> 33:44.424
Oh, my God.
It's go time!

33:44.457 --> 33:45.626
Hey!

33:45.659 --> 33:46.860
Alan, how many
times a day

33:46.893 --> 33:48.629
do I have
to tell you
to be cool?

33:49.429 --> 33:51.131
I'm just trying
to talk to Sam.

33:51.164 --> 33:53.133
Yeah, yeah,
it looked
like you guys

33:53.166 --> 33:55.736
were having
a regular meeting
of the minds.

33:55.769 --> 33:57.437
What's this
all about, Sam?

33:58.939 --> 34:00.440
Mr. Rosso...

34:03.243 --> 34:05.278
I need a ride home.

34:05.311 --> 34:07.280
If the hour hand
of a clock

34:07.313 --> 34:10.150
moves k radians
in 48 minutes,

34:10.183 --> 34:11.785
then k equals...

34:15.021 --> 34:16.690
They're
a tough team.

34:17.691 --> 34:19.092
You nervous?

34:19.125 --> 34:20.594
I don't
get nervous.

34:21.261 --> 34:23.530
Wow.
That's great.

34:24.464 --> 34:26.232
I wish I was
that confident.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.870
It comes with being
first block.

34:29.903 --> 34:31.705
Yeah, I remember.

34:36.409 --> 34:37.511
0.4.

34:38.078 --> 34:39.412
Correct.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.247
(QUIET APPLAUSE)

34:41.281 --> 34:45.185
Well, guess I'm up.
Wish me luck.

34:46.587 --> 34:48.755
(APPLAUSE)

34:52.158 --> 34:53.694
FREAKS: Woo!

34:53.727 --> 34:55.128
Woo hoo!

35:10.811 --> 35:17.350
Question one:
if the longer diagonal
of a rhombus is 10,

35:17.383 --> 35:19.786
and the large angle
is 100 degrees,

35:19.820 --> 35:22.322
what is the area
of the rhombus?

35:27.661 --> 35:28.829
42.

35:28.862 --> 35:30.363
Correct.

35:32.766 --> 35:34.801
Woo!
Woo hoo!

35:37.571 --> 35:38.939
You okay, Sam?

35:38.972 --> 35:40.574
I thought you
were gonna change.

35:42.108 --> 35:44.144
Do I have to
go back to school?

35:44.177 --> 35:47.948
I mean, I'm sick of
everybody laughing at me.

35:47.981 --> 35:49.783
So? Let 'em laugh.

35:49.816 --> 35:51.518
Who cares?

35:51.552 --> 35:55.321
Sam, when I
was about 20,

35:55.355 --> 35:57.558
I was hanging out
in this honky‐tonk
down south

35:57.591 --> 36:01.695
when a big bunch
of rednecks
surrounded me.

36:01.728 --> 36:03.764
Started making
jokes about
my fringe vest,

36:03.797 --> 36:05.098
my hair.

36:05.131 --> 36:06.733
Calling me
a hippie,

36:06.767 --> 36:08.034
a woman.

36:08.068 --> 36:09.636
They dragged me
into an alley,

36:09.670 --> 36:10.837
made me dance,

36:10.871 --> 36:13.239
told me to
bark like a dog.

36:13.273 --> 36:15.175
Did you do it?

36:15.909 --> 36:17.043
Yeah.

36:17.077 --> 36:19.212
Pretty much had to,
there was 10 of them.

36:21.114 --> 36:22.448
What happened?

36:23.249 --> 36:24.818
It doesn't matter.

36:24.851 --> 36:28.722
What matters is that
I never lost pride
in who I am.

36:30.857 --> 36:35.896
Mr. Rosso, I dressed up
just to impress
Cindy Sanders.

36:35.929 --> 36:38.331
Sam, some
of my friends

36:38.364 --> 36:40.801
are the dirtiest,
stinkiest guys
you'll ever meet,

36:40.834 --> 36:42.035
but they date
more women

36:42.068 --> 36:43.570
than you or I
could ever hope for.

36:43.604 --> 36:46.507
It's all about
confidence.

36:47.641 --> 36:48.875
It's true.

36:50.143 --> 36:53.446
If I say
I'm the coolest guy
in the world

36:53.479 --> 36:57.083
and I believe
I'm the coolest guy
in the world,

36:57.117 --> 36:58.585
then suddenly
I become

36:58.619 --> 37:01.321
the coolest guy
in the world.

37:01.354 --> 37:04.290
I'm telling you,
it sounds weird,
but it works.

37:04.324 --> 37:06.359
But I'm not cool.

37:07.961 --> 37:09.095
You're not?

37:09.129 --> 37:10.597
No.

37:11.131 --> 37:12.398
Hmm.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.638
Well, then take
a look at this kid.

37:20.140 --> 37:23.610
Because that's
a cool kid.

37:26.913 --> 37:30.016
One horizontal
and one vertical
asymptote.

37:30.050 --> 37:32.385
Correct.
Well done, McKinley.

37:33.086 --> 37:35.556
Woo hoo! Lindsay!

37:36.890 --> 37:43.564
"If arc sine x
equals 2 arc cosine x,
then x equals..."

37:43.597 --> 37:46.800
Damn, I've never
felt so stupid
in my whole life.

37:52.072 --> 37:53.239
0.9.

37:53.273 --> 37:54.908
JUDGE: Correct.

37:54.941 --> 37:56.843
Perfect round
to McKinley.

38:01.582 --> 38:02.949
You were great,
Lindsay.

38:02.983 --> 38:04.150
You were so great.

38:04.184 --> 38:05.919
You're a born
mathlete.

38:05.952 --> 38:07.353
Okay, Shelly,
come on.

38:07.387 --> 38:10.023
Let's give 'em
that old McKinley
one‐two punch.

38:10.056 --> 38:11.424
Good luck, Shelly.

38:17.397 --> 38:20.033
"A sphere is inscribed
in a cube.

38:20.066 --> 38:23.169

"to the volume
of the cube is..."

38:34.981 --> 38:36.282
Come on, Shelly.

38:36.316 --> 38:37.984
We just went
over this last week.

38:44.825 --> 38:46.492
0.52‐to‐1.

38:47.628 --> 38:48.695
Correct.

38:59.005 --> 39:02.275
Did you guys see Shelly
when she missed that
square root problem?

39:02.308 --> 39:04.077
She started
sweating like a pig.

39:04.110 --> 39:06.479
ERIN: Hey, Millie,
now maybe Kowchevski

39:06.513 --> 39:07.614
will kick her
off the team,

39:07.648 --> 39:09.082
and you can
get your block back.

39:09.115 --> 39:10.851
I guess.
I hope so.

39:10.884 --> 39:13.620
I mean,
I kind of felt bad
for Shelly, though.

39:14.354 --> 39:15.789
Forget her.
She had it coming.

39:15.822 --> 39:17.591
ERIN: Oh, hey,
you guys, come here.

39:17.624 --> 39:19.392
You've got to see
M. I. T.'s dorms.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.827
Wait a minute.

39:20.861 --> 39:22.395
If I think I'm cool,

39:22.428 --> 39:24.464
then people will think
I'm cool, too.

39:24.497 --> 39:27.067
Yeah, that's what
Mr. Rosso said.

39:27.100 --> 39:29.302
Yeah, and he's cool.

39:29.335 --> 39:31.805
Yeah, but I already
think I'm cool.

39:31.838 --> 39:33.507
But nobody else does.

39:33.540 --> 39:35.275
Maybe that's
because you're not.

39:35.308 --> 39:38.378
Hey, shut up. I am so.

39:38.411 --> 39:41.047
So am I.
I'm really cool.

39:42.448 --> 39:43.617
You know what, Sam?

39:43.650 --> 39:46.553
You actually
do seem cooler
all of a sudden.

39:46.587 --> 39:48.421
I think
it's working.

39:49.823 --> 39:51.958
Mr. Rosso's
some kind of genius.

40:22.022 --> 40:23.590
MILLIE: Lindsay.

40:23.624 --> 40:25.458
Where are you going?

40:28.494 --> 40:30.597
Millie,
I gotta go home.

40:32.533 --> 40:33.934
What's the matter?

40:33.967 --> 40:35.836
Are you gonna go
use your own bathroom?

40:36.903 --> 40:38.438
No, it's...

40:39.506 --> 40:41.307
I just can't do this.

40:41.341 --> 40:42.976
Really?

40:43.009 --> 40:44.611
Yeah. I mean,

40:44.645 --> 40:47.581
it's been great
hanging out with you,

40:47.614 --> 40:51.552
but it's just not
where I'm at anymore.

40:53.253 --> 40:54.855
Things are different now.

40:55.989 --> 40:57.190
What do you want to do?

40:59.059 --> 41:00.527
I don't know.

41:02.963 --> 41:05.131
But I don't think
I want to be
a mathlete.

41:07.367 --> 41:10.904
That's okay. I understand.

41:13.306 --> 41:15.709
But can we still
play Uno sometimes?

41:15.742 --> 41:18.712
I mean, when you've
got nothing else to do?

41:19.846 --> 41:22.716
Yeah, we can
always do that.

41:22.749 --> 41:25.018
Millie, we'll
always be friends.

41:29.289 --> 41:32.025
I'll see you around
tomorrow, okay?

want to maybe go see

I think there's
a foreign film playing
at the state theater.

41:54.648 --> 41:58.351
A foreign film?
Is that the kind
you have to read?

41:58.384 --> 41:59.853
What's the point?

41:59.886 --> 42:01.622
The point is trying
not to be a dumb ass

42:01.655 --> 42:04.124
for once in your life,
that's what.

42:04.157 --> 42:06.092
That's the point,
apparently.

I'll go.

Nothing.
What are you
guys up to?

42:26.246 --> 42:28.248
Nothing.
