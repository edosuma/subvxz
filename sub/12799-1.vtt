opposes the messenger,

The crack troops are ready to fulfill
your all-powerful commands.

See where my little finger is?

16:08.000 --> 16:11.607
- That's Ha-wa-ii.
- Maybe...

all that is beautiful in our island.

01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:58.482
Fly away as far as you can!
I'll put an end to it all!

01:12:58.674 --> 01:13:01.211
Farewell, Erica!

01:13:01.410 --> 01:13:04.323
Longway, don't! Longway, no!

01:13:04.513 --> 01:13:10.020
Erica, you should be proud of him.
The guy wants to be a hero.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.256
Come on, Longway!

01:13:16.492 --> 01:13:18.165
[ Explosion ]

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.115
What them?

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:31.841
I've been fighting
with that crazy lady,

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:34.078
caught up in her wicked
possessed luggage,

01:13:34.277 --> 01:13:36.780
and tossed all over the place
like a rag doll,

01:13:37.013 --> 01:13:39.687
and you've been having
a pigging-out party for one!

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.929
Ah... ow...

01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:48.034
What happened here?
I seem to have had a nightmare.

01:13:48.891 --> 01:13:53.931
A bit later, penguin, I'll tell you
about all the feats that I performed,

01:13:54.130 --> 01:13:57.077
while you were snoring
your head off here.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:14:00.736
Now, though, let's go and sift through
the rubble to find your hero.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:03.713
Longway? Longway?

01:14:03.906 --> 01:14:05.579
Longway?

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.220
Longway, please be alive.

01:14:07.410 --> 01:14:12.257
Come on, mallards.
Never leave a quack-a-doodle behind.

01:14:12.882 --> 01:14:15.658
Longway! Son!

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:21.897
Come on, Longway, please be alive.

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:25.230
Oh, look...

01:14:25.428 --> 01:14:26.930
He's alive!

01:14:27.129 --> 01:14:29.109
Aghhhhh!

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.677
Longway's "Walking Dead Duck".

01:14:38.474 --> 01:14:41.250
So, did we win the game?

01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.956
But this is impossible.

01:14:47.149 --> 01:14:49.823
Our great Charter Chatter
clearly states:

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:53.796
the sun duck was supposed
to give his life!

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:57.770
That old Chatter?
Come on, it's so out of date.

01:14:58.194 --> 01:15:02.370
I suppose I should read
the fine print.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:05.472
Really had me scared
for a minute there, quack-job.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:06.668
Thanks for not dying.

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.338
Come, everyone.

01:15:08.537 --> 01:15:12.314
Let's go back home
and celebrate our victory.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:16.012
And, mallards!
We need to get going.

01:15:16.212 --> 01:15:17.782
You're coming to celebrate with us.

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:21.359
This is our victory.
All of us.

01:15:56.986 --> 01:16:00.263
Oh, no! I was supposed
to meet her for dinner!

01:16:00.489 --> 01:16:04.995
What's wrong with you, boss?
Why didn't you wake me up?

01:16:11.267 --> 01:16:12.267
Ms. Knout?

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:15.541
I hope I'm not too late
for our dinner dale.

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:17.217
[Barking]

01:16:21.877 --> 01:16:24.050
What happened?

01:16:31.187 --> 01:16:34.930
You're beautiful, my dear.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:36.728
Oh, shut up.

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:42.808
Check it out, my chubby survivor!

01:16:43.032 --> 01:16:47.378
We are the only survivors
of the end of (he world!

01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:51.211
Everything is ours!
Everything!

01:16:51.407 --> 01:16:55.321
Yeah, yeah, all the food, too!

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:58.251
So, we aren't the only survivors.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:01.121
Eat a duck, for good luck.

01:17:01.317 --> 01:17:03.160
Eat a duck, for good luck!

01:17:03.385 --> 01:17:04.385
Meow!

01:17:04.753 --> 01:17:07.597
Eat a duck, for good luck!

01:17:07.957 --> 01:17:08.957
Hey, you!

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.401
Eat a duck, for good luck!

01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:12.971
Meow!

01:17:14.830 --> 01:17:16.639
You mangy cat!

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:18.436
Eat a duck, for good luck!

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:21.474
[Purr]

01:17:22.071 --> 01:17:23.607
Go away!

01:17:23.973 --> 01:17:24.610
Meow!

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:26.616
I guess that's good...

01:17:26.809 --> 01:17:28.686
Because...

01:17:28.911 --> 01:17:33.656
Now we still have people to rob!
Score!

01:17:35.784 --> 01:17:38.822
Agh! Who made this'? lck!

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.021
Tastes like cal poop!

01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:41.532
Huh?

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:42.258
B-But...

01:17:42.458 --> 01:17:43.664
you can talk?

01:17:43.859 --> 01:17:47.705
Why didn't you say anything
before now, dummy?

01:17:48.430 --> 01:17:50.103
Ah!

01:17:52.168 --> 01:17:54.978
Well, before, the gingerbreads
used to be good.

01:17:55.171 --> 01:17:56.309
Ah!

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:03.222
Sir!

01:18:03.445 --> 01:18:04.549
Home, at last!

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:08.819
Sir, I'm so glad you survived!

01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:09.621
Captain!

01:18:09.818 --> 01:18:10.353
Wait!

01:18:10.553 --> 01:18:12.032
Oh, my captain!

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:14.326
Oh, my benevolent dictator...

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:17.697
Oh, my hero. My captain...
Duckmus!

01:18:20.129 --> 01:18:23.303
A toast to my son, the sun duck!

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:25.001
Here, here!

01:18:25.201 --> 01:18:29.672
And a toast to Duckmus, my friend and
comrade-in-arms,

01:18:29.872 --> 01:18:35.220
whose daughter I am graciously
allowing to befriend my son.

01:18:35.411 --> 01:18:36.014
Thank you.

01:18:36.212 --> 01:18:40.319
Although what's actually happened is
that I am graciously allowing your son

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.894
to befriend my daughter.

01:18:43.085 --> 01:18:46.259
I have also decreed that the happy
chums shall live together

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:50.368
in our flock, as honored Mandarins.

01:18:50.559 --> 01:18:52.266
And I decree that the happy couple

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:56.601
will live in our flock
as honored mallards.

01:18:56.832 --> 01:18:59.506
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Not going to happen.

01:19:00.836 --> 01:19:04.750
I'm trying to eat some cake, here!

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:05.509
Oy!

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:08.382
You can't eat cake
until the happy chums are here.

01:19:08.944 --> 01:19:15.691
Oh, well, Longway said I could
just go ahead and eat it.

01:19:15.884 --> 01:19:18.364
Because they took off there...

01:19:19.888 --> 01:19:22.300
to Hawaii.

01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:33.610
Oh, then, it shouldn't take long
to find them.

01:19:33.802 --> 01:19:35.440
They're still here on the island.

01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:37.481
What's wrong with you?

01:19:37.706 --> 01:19:39.583
You need to check your gas mask
for a leak.

01:19:39.775 --> 01:19:42.779
I think some poison gas got
into your brain or something.

01:19:42.978 --> 01:19:43.978
Penguin!

01:19:44.046 --> 01:19:47.050
Don't make me declare war
on you again.

01:19:47.249 --> 01:19:50.423
Because I'll do it.
I will bring the fury of a...
