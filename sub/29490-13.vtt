WEBVTT

00:42.694 --> 00:43.739
Shit.

01:16.772 --> 01:19.775
Aah! Aah!

01:28.784 --> 01:34.659
Oh, no, no, no, no!

02:28.626 --> 02:31.063
You couldn't have done that
five hours ago?

02:31.107 --> 02:34.197
Why would I do that?

02:41.944 --> 02:44.903
Come on.
Family's inland.

02:44.947 --> 02:46.905
And the munitions?

02:46.949 --> 02:49.778
Everything's inland.

03:08.492 --> 03:11.060
I need
to get back.

03:11.103 --> 03:12.844
We headed in?

03:12.888 --> 03:15.499
Well, I can't show up
empty-handed.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.240
Wife wouldn't like that.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.763
Oh, my God.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.417
This garden's her baby.

03:20.461 --> 03:23.768
Got herbs and teas
for everything --

03:23.812 --> 03:26.423
pain, nerves, sleep.

03:26.467 --> 03:27.903
How 'bout focus
and speed?

03:27.946 --> 03:31.385
Well, those Whisper folkreally got you percolatin', huh?

03:31.428 --> 03:33.300
There's a lot of lives
at stake.

03:33.343 --> 03:36.868
Where are these munition depots
you spoke of?

03:36.912 --> 03:38.609
Is this one of them?

03:38.653 --> 03:41.612
Nah, that's just
an old lab --

03:41.656 --> 03:42.874
some structural damage.

03:42.918 --> 03:44.876
Wild animals
get in there sometimes.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.269
Best to stay away.

04:12.948 --> 04:16.038
My kidswould run riot in here.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.912
My boy
seems to think

04:20.956 --> 04:22.523
maybe the sailors
must've left

04:22.566 --> 04:27.484
a buried treasure
in the grain silos.

04:27.528 --> 04:30.139
I can barely get himnot to claw his way up the thing

04:30.182 --> 04:32.750
and jump inside.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.928
Kid's 5.

04:40.149 --> 04:43.935
He's just like
his mom.

04:45.763 --> 04:47.591
Once they decide
to do somethin',

04:47.635 --> 04:50.986
ain't a damn thing you can do
to stop 'em.

04:51.029 --> 04:53.336
I remember one time I --

04:53.380 --> 04:54.946
Stop the bullshit.

04:54.990 --> 04:58.210
Now, where the hell
is your family?

05:00.604 --> 05:03.564
When I said I had to
come home to my family,

05:03.607 --> 05:05.957
I meant it.

05:08.482 --> 05:11.833
I promised her
when we got married.

05:11.876 --> 05:13.835
Flowers every day.

05:13.878 --> 05:16.751
How are you gonna wait till nowto tell me this?

05:20.494 --> 05:21.886
Those words
don't come easy.

05:21.930 --> 05:25.455
I don't like
to bring people here.

05:25.499 --> 05:27.109
Don't trust 'em.

05:27.152 --> 05:28.458
I was scared.

05:28.502 --> 05:30.808
Are there any weapons hereat all?

05:30.852 --> 05:33.463
I promised
I would help you check,

05:33.507 --> 05:35.030
and I will,
but --

05:35.073 --> 05:37.772
Ugh, I'm gonna
find 'em myself.The island's not clear.

05:37.815 --> 05:40.862
No shit
it's not clear!

05:40.905 --> 05:44.474
It was
until the others came.

05:44.518 --> 05:46.911
They brought violence.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.784
The sickness
came with it.

05:49.827 --> 05:50.785
Killed my family.

05:50.828 --> 05:53.048
We never had
a lotta Rippers.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.659
So I never really
got good at...

05:55.703 --> 06:00.621
doing
what it is you do.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.623
You're good
with a sword.

06:02.666 --> 06:04.581
What are you askin' me?

06:07.410 --> 06:10.065
My family's
still in there.

06:11.588 --> 06:13.242
My wife.

06:13.285 --> 06:14.939
My babies.

06:14.983 --> 06:18.769
That's why
I asked you to come.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.858
Needed you to come.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.723
Shit. Sorry.

08:35.166 --> 08:37.081
What do we do?

08:42.173 --> 08:44.698
Follow me.
Stay close.

09:05.240 --> 09:07.590
Get behind that --
now.

09:31.745 --> 09:34.661
Thank you.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.677
Virgil: I wanted to give them
somethin' they loved

11:17.720 --> 11:19.113
to take with 'em.

11:21.637 --> 11:24.292
And Jasmine
loved that book.

11:24.335 --> 11:27.164
Look, I know that this is hard,and I am sorry,

11:27.208 --> 11:28.470
but I have got
to get back.

11:28.513 --> 11:32.300
My wife,
whenever I had a hard time,

11:32.343 --> 11:35.129
she'd talk me
through it.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.261
Without her,
I don't know who I am.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.873
It's not too lateto find out. Look --

11:39.916 --> 11:42.397
I wanted
to ask you...

11:47.358 --> 11:48.838
It's been
a long time

11:48.882 --> 11:51.145
since I had a reason
to say thank you to someone.

11:51.188 --> 11:52.494
Don't thank me.

11:52.537 --> 11:54.017
Just show mewhat I came here for,

11:54.061 --> 11:55.279
and I'll go.

11:55.323 --> 11:57.238
No,
it's gettin' late.

11:57.281 --> 11:58.892
Tide's low.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.284
Oh, God.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.765
I'm not sure the boat'll make itthrough the channel.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.246
Might wanna stay here tonight
and not risk it.

12:05.289 --> 12:08.336
Virgil, I need you to hold upyour end of the bargain.

12:08.379 --> 12:09.337
Yeah. But...

12:12.557 --> 12:13.863
It's gettin' dark,

12:13.907 --> 12:16.692
and some of the buildings
aren't safe.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.216
Could we do this
in the morning?

12:19.260 --> 12:24.221
We can do it
first thing.

13:39.079 --> 13:42.386
Man:
Stay still. Everyone quiet.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.285
Is it him?

14:11.328 --> 14:13.113
Woman:
I don't know.

14:19.554 --> 14:20.555
What is that?

14:20.598 --> 14:23.340
I don't know.
Quiet. Stop moving.

14:23.384 --> 14:26.430
It might not be him.

14:26.474 --> 14:28.128
Shh.

14:28.171 --> 14:30.217
No,
I don't know.
Be calm.

14:30.260 --> 14:33.698
Stop moving.

14:39.487 --> 14:40.749
Virgil!

14:40.792 --> 14:42.794
Virgil: Why couldn't you
just wait until morning?

14:42.838 --> 14:44.840
I told you
it wasn't safe.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.233
Virgil,
open the damn door.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.931
I trusted you,
and you ruined it.

14:48.975 --> 14:51.412
Open the damn door,
Virgil!

14:52.892 --> 14:54.415
Virgil!

14:54.458 --> 14:56.330
Virgil!

14:56.373 --> 14:58.071
Virgil!

15:30.320 --> 15:33.671
Oh, shit!

15:46.510 --> 15:47.729
Damn it.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.559
Man:
Calm down.

15:52.603 --> 15:53.953
Hello?

15:53.996 --> 15:56.607
Woman: We've been tryingto talk to you.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.609
How long
have I been in here?

15:58.653 --> 16:00.960
A day maybe?

16:01.003 --> 16:03.440
A day?

16:03.484 --> 16:04.615
Why didn't you answer me

16:04.659 --> 16:06.748
when I called out to you
the first time?

16:06.791 --> 16:08.315
He blows up
at us sometimes.

16:08.358 --> 16:09.751
Gets in
one of his moods.

16:09.794 --> 16:11.231
When he's angry
like that,

16:11.274 --> 16:12.536
it's best
to be quiet.

16:12.580 --> 16:13.973
You guys know this building,
right?

16:14.016 --> 16:15.409
What's the layout?

16:15.452 --> 16:17.280
Don't bother
trying to escape.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.847
Whole place
is booby-trapped.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.197
What's his routine?
How often does he come around?

16:21.241 --> 16:22.546
As little as possible.

16:22.590 --> 16:25.419
He doesn't like
to see us.

16:29.075 --> 16:31.338
Celeste and I were researchers
with Virgil.

16:31.381 --> 16:33.035
We wrote the papers.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.603
Yeah,
and I swept the floors.She assisted us.

16:35.646 --> 16:38.432
So you had a life here.
You knew each other.

16:38.475 --> 16:41.957
Yeah,
we were friends with Virgil.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.133
Tell me
what went wrong.

16:44.177 --> 16:46.614
Stragglers used to comeby boat,

16:46.657 --> 16:49.486
stumble on us,
and we took 'em in.

16:49.530 --> 16:50.879
We took 'em all in.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.272
One night,
it got really bad.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.621
Food supplies
were gettin' low,

16:53.664 --> 16:57.190
and a fight broke out
over the rations and --

16:57.233 --> 17:00.889
And somebody pulled a knife,and this newbie died.

17:00.932 --> 17:03.587
Virgil was late
gettin' there,

17:03.631 --> 17:04.632
panicked.

17:04.675 --> 17:07.113
Said we need
to lock all the doors.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.549
He didn't know.

17:08.592 --> 17:12.640
Virgil didn't know.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.120
Know what?

17:15.164 --> 17:18.254
His wife and kids
were inside.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.439
He snapped.

17:29.483 --> 17:31.224
He was never
the same.

17:31.267 --> 17:33.574
We've been in here
ever since.

17:34.618 --> 17:36.751
You okay?

17:36.794 --> 17:39.319
I will be.

17:40.450 --> 17:42.496
I'm not
stayin' here long.

17:42.539 --> 17:45.064
You need some rest.
Eat something.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.761
The food
should be okay.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.241
Save your strength.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.505
You can't kill him if
you don't have your strength.

17:54.595 --> 17:58.512
Celeste: You haven'ttold us your name.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.603
It's Michonne.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.093
I'm glad you ate.

18:14.136 --> 18:15.877
Open the damn door!

18:15.920 --> 18:17.444
I can't do that.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.141
Why the hell not?!

18:19.185 --> 18:20.838
Because you'll kill me.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.101
I know you will.

18:22.144 --> 18:25.539
Well, we reap what we sow,asshole.

18:26.583 --> 18:30.021
I don't wanna fight.

18:30.065 --> 18:33.068
I want you
to understand.

18:45.602 --> 18:49.563
The island has a gift.

18:49.606 --> 18:53.958
It can help you
the way it helped me.

18:55.873 --> 18:57.092
Aah!

19:12.063 --> 19:15.632
What the hell
did you do?

19:43.704 --> 19:45.793
What did you --
what did you...

19:45.836 --> 19:47.969
Jimsonweed.

19:48.012 --> 19:50.580
Makes a nice tea.

19:50.624 --> 19:52.103
Calming.

19:52.147 --> 19:54.497
I want you to see.

19:54.541 --> 19:57.718
You don't think I see it,
but I do.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.590
You're in pain,
like me.

20:00.634 --> 20:03.898
You need peace,
like me.

20:03.941 --> 20:05.856
Like you? No.

20:05.900 --> 20:08.598
I don't drug peopleand toss them in cells.

20:08.642 --> 20:10.121
"Toss them in cells"?
Yes, you've said.

20:10.165 --> 20:14.735
We've had that conversation
three times.

20:14.778 --> 20:16.084
I need you
to hear me.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.695
I need you to think aboutmy daughter and my son.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.654
"Think you about
my daughter and my son."

20:20.697 --> 20:23.134
Yes,
I said those words, too,

20:23.178 --> 20:25.311
but no one listened.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.053
Everything I did
was to protect my family.

20:29.097 --> 20:32.666
Oh-ho-ho-ho-ho, I'm surethey're realproud of you now.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.581
Siddiq:
What about mychild?

20:34.624 --> 20:37.888
My family?

20:43.372 --> 20:45.156
You're no angel.

20:51.467 --> 20:53.904
I'm so cold.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.864
It's cold.
It's cold.

20:56.907 --> 20:59.258
So picture the sun.

21:06.787 --> 21:10.704
Let the medicine
do its work.

21:23.369 --> 21:24.805
Siddiq.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.334
You were supposed to
protect us.

21:32.378 --> 21:35.294
I did my best.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.818
You let me die.

21:37.861 --> 21:41.909
No!
And Rick and Carl.

21:41.952 --> 21:44.390
What happens to Coco?

21:44.433 --> 21:46.914
What happens
to my family?

21:46.957 --> 21:48.481
You are my family.

21:48.524 --> 21:52.180
Well, this is how it feels
to be your family!

21:57.403 --> 22:00.536
Stop! Stop it! Stop!

22:10.067 --> 22:13.244
Siddiq?

22:25.866 --> 22:28.999
Virgil's Voice:
Stop fighting it.

22:33.917 --> 22:37.399
She's waiting.

23:00.988 --> 23:05.819
Oh, no, no, no, no!

23:47.121 --> 23:48.905
Michonne:
Hey!

23:50.951 --> 23:53.344
Help!

23:53.388 --> 23:56.522
Help! Please!

23:56.565 --> 23:58.437
Help me! Please!Come on. Let's go!

24:01.091 --> 24:04.486
Please!

24:15.105 --> 24:19.501
Well,
looky what we have here.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.469
Goddamn.

24:30.512 --> 24:34.081
This chick
has some cojones.

24:34.124 --> 24:35.430
I don't want any trouble.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.084
Well, then,
you probably shouldn't have

24:37.127 --> 24:38.564
taken a swing
at me.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.654
Or I probablyshouldn't have missed.

24:47.703 --> 24:52.926
You know, I'm not much on
savin' people on the road,

24:52.969 --> 24:56.973
especially those
that try to take my head off,

24:57.017 --> 25:00.150
but I gotta say,
I like you

25:00.194 --> 25:04.938
and your big,
ol' massive lady nuts.

25:04.981 --> 25:07.941
Besides,
be a waste

25:07.984 --> 25:12.467
to have such a nice sword
and no strength to use it.

25:19.300 --> 25:22.782
Name's Negan.

26:18.402 --> 26:21.188
Negan: Eenie...

26:21.231 --> 26:24.017
meenie...

26:24.060 --> 26:26.149
miney...

26:26.193 --> 26:28.543
Nah.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.893
Just kiddin', assholes.

26:30.937 --> 26:34.723
See, I was gonna do
this next part myself,

26:34.767 --> 26:38.727
but, see, my right-hand gal,
Michonne,

26:38.771 --> 26:41.600
is on a wicked-ass tear
these days,

26:41.643 --> 26:45.647
and who the hell am I
to stand in her way?

26:52.262 --> 26:54.917
Mm.

26:59.139 --> 27:02.882
You wish 'em a happy new yearfrom us, will ya?

27:07.843 --> 27:12.500
You didn't know
who they were...

27:14.458 --> 27:16.809
...or where
they were from.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.901
You didn't know shit
about them.

27:21.944 --> 27:27.036
But you came
in the dead of night

27:27.080 --> 27:32.738
and slaughtered them anyway
in their sleep.

27:42.835 --> 27:47.317
Like cowards.

28:00.156 --> 28:02.855
Ah.

28:12.212 --> 28:15.128
And you remember...

28:15.171 --> 28:17.521
you did this.

28:17.565 --> 28:22.178
What happens next...

28:22.222 --> 28:25.051
it's your fault.

28:27.227 --> 28:30.230
Welcome to the new world.

28:30.273 --> 28:31.448
Ha!

29:36.513 --> 29:38.341
You feel better?

29:40.256 --> 29:43.303
You will.

29:55.358 --> 29:58.187
Aah!

30:15.988 --> 30:17.467
Lucy: Michonne.Jeremiah:
Don't leave us.

30:17.511 --> 30:19.165
Celeste:
Let us out. Please.

30:19.208 --> 30:20.383
Michonne.

30:35.181 --> 30:38.662
Oh, shit.

30:57.290 --> 30:59.466
I was gonna ask you
to help me.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.424
I wanted
to let them go.

31:01.468 --> 31:03.122
I wanted you to be there
so they wouldn't kill me.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.514
Then you
found 'em first,

31:04.558 --> 31:06.473
and I knew
you were gonna kill me, too.

31:06.516 --> 31:07.953
I'm sorry.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.520
You're sorry?"Sorry" doesn't cut it.

31:11.782 --> 31:15.438
She always told me
the right thing to do,

31:15.482 --> 31:17.005
and then she was gone

31:17.049 --> 31:19.051
and I didn't know
what to do.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.704
And I couldn't
let you leave,

31:20.748 --> 31:22.532
and I didn't
wanna kill you.

31:22.576 --> 31:24.056
Move, Michonne.

31:24.099 --> 31:26.667
You have as much reason
to kill this asshole as we do.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.060
I do.

31:50.691 --> 31:53.563
Celeste:
Do it or move.

31:57.698 --> 32:00.440
Look at him.

32:02.224 --> 32:05.967
He owes you more
than he can ever make right.

32:06.011 --> 32:10.493
Taking his life...

32:10.537 --> 32:15.411
you'll lose
more of yourself.

32:15.455 --> 32:18.110
It doesn't settle it.

32:18.153 --> 32:21.940
But your mercy
gives you something.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.811
You get something.

32:23.854 --> 32:25.813
What?

32:25.856 --> 32:27.858
Peace.

32:50.838 --> 32:53.319
Michonne:There's nothing here.

32:53.362 --> 32:54.537
I checked
every building,

32:54.581 --> 32:58.019
even the ones you saidhad structural damage.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.630
Not a Goddamn thing
anywhere.

33:00.674 --> 33:04.417
I know you don't have
any reason to believe me,

33:04.460 --> 33:07.246
but I never lied to you
about the weapons.

33:07.289 --> 33:09.204
You said
you'd seen them.

33:09.248 --> 33:12.294
I told you
I could show you the spots.

33:12.338 --> 33:14.209
I got no reason
to go in them.

33:14.253 --> 33:16.472
You have gotto do better than that.

33:16.516 --> 33:18.126
I'm sorry.
I can't.

33:18.170 --> 33:20.868
Sometimes we find
a stray shell,

33:20.911 --> 33:23.305
but never
any more than --

33:23.349 --> 33:28.049
I --
I find a stray shell.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.270
I'm notgoing back empty-handed.

33:31.313 --> 33:32.619
Take whatever you want.

33:32.662 --> 33:34.186
Clear my debt
with Oceanside.

33:37.015 --> 33:39.060
You took the risk.

33:39.104 --> 33:41.280
Didn't have a choice.

33:42.324 --> 33:45.110
I had to find out.

33:48.330 --> 33:51.203
And there's no tea,
so don't even ask.

33:58.732 --> 34:02.170
What do you see whenyou're trippin', anyway?

34:03.737 --> 34:07.697
Lisa with that damn camera
pointed at everyone.

34:07.741 --> 34:10.961
My babies.

34:13.964 --> 34:17.968
Jasmine sittin' by the fire
with that book,

34:18.012 --> 34:20.188
askin' a million questions

34:20.232 --> 34:23.800
about a world
she'll never know.

34:26.455 --> 34:29.110
Bobby and me lyin'
on the roof of that Annex,

34:29.154 --> 34:32.940
lookin' up
at the stars.

34:32.983 --> 34:36.813
Heaven.

34:39.251 --> 34:42.036
I wanted --

34:42.080 --> 34:46.823
hoped that
you would see that, too.

34:49.087 --> 34:53.047
It took my family
from me.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.093
I saw hell.

34:55.136 --> 34:58.052
I'm sorry.

34:58.096 --> 35:03.666
Only world I ever wanted
was one they were in.

35:03.710 --> 35:06.408
I don't know how to do this
without them.

35:06.452 --> 35:10.499
You try,like the rest of us.

35:10.543 --> 35:13.807
Now, how 'boutyou try to find my stuff?

36:19.655 --> 36:22.658
Where the hell
did you get these?

36:37.760 --> 36:39.632
Virgil:
It washed up.

36:39.675 --> 36:41.764
It washed up
during the big storm.

36:41.808 --> 36:43.113
I don't know
where the hell it came from.

36:43.157 --> 36:44.550
Wait.

36:45.594 --> 36:47.857
No!
Michonne.

37:38.908 --> 37:42.303
Holy shit.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.914
That's you.

37:44.958 --> 37:48.396
And the kid?

37:55.708 --> 37:58.319
You knew.

38:00.887 --> 38:03.890
You came to find us
at Oceanside.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.239
No.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.675
What?

38:06.719 --> 38:09.330
Uh, uh,
why would I do that?

38:09.374 --> 38:10.853
Because of this.

38:10.897 --> 38:13.334
I have never seen that before
in my life. I swear.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.684
But why are his things here?What was he doing here?

38:15.728 --> 38:17.033
How the hell
would I know?

38:17.077 --> 38:19.514
You knew that this boat was herethis whole time.

38:19.558 --> 38:20.907
Virgil:
The world ended.

38:20.950 --> 38:23.039
Boats wash up.What do you want me to say?

38:24.258 --> 38:25.912
You knew
that there were no munitions.

38:25.955 --> 38:28.001
Were you setting up a trap
for us?

38:28.044 --> 38:29.742
Did you lay a trap
for him?

38:29.785 --> 38:32.353
What did you do?
What did you do to him?

38:34.137 --> 38:38.316
Who are you
talking about?

39:07.693 --> 39:11.087
Virgil: I don't know what it is
you think I have

39:11.131 --> 39:17.180
or who
you're looking for, but...

39:17.224 --> 39:22.795
maybe it wasn't an accident
that we met.

39:22.838 --> 39:26.233
If the others
will help me,

39:26.276 --> 39:27.843
I think
we can mod the engine

39:27.887 --> 39:29.105
and get it
workin' again.

39:32.282 --> 39:36.069
If this person
was on this boat,

39:36.112 --> 39:38.506
then maybe you can
find them again.

40:19.939 --> 40:21.984
Gonna take some time.

40:22.028 --> 40:25.031
We're out of time.

40:25.074 --> 40:26.859
They're willing
to let you come.

40:26.902 --> 40:27.947
They say that?

40:27.990 --> 40:30.036
There's only
one boat left.

40:30.079 --> 40:32.038
You leave now
or you don't leave.

40:32.081 --> 40:34.214
After everything,

40:34.257 --> 40:37.435
I can't believe
they would do that.

40:37.478 --> 40:41.700
Sometimes the most injuredare the most forgiving.

40:41.743 --> 40:46.226
They're good people, Virgil,and they're trying,

40:46.269 --> 40:50.535
giving you a chance,a way off of this island.

40:53.059 --> 40:57.629
I promised her flowers
every day.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.392
Shoto.

42:05.435 --> 42:08.177
Shoto, are you there?

42:08.221 --> 42:11.093
It's Daito.

42:12.181 --> 42:13.226
Shoto?

42:13.269 --> 42:15.489
Are you out there?

42:15.533 --> 42:18.144
Anyone?

42:21.626 --> 42:24.367
Judith:
I'm here, Daito.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.807
I've been trying you.

42:30.373 --> 42:33.159
I'm sorry.
I'm here now.

42:33.202 --> 42:34.595
Are you still
with Virgil?

42:34.639 --> 42:37.337
No, but I found three peopleon the island,

42:37.380 --> 42:39.948
and I'm helping themget back home.

42:40.775 --> 42:43.865
I've missed you
and your brother so much.

42:43.909 --> 42:45.388
Mama.

42:46.215 --> 42:48.174
Judith:
No, no.

42:48.217 --> 42:50.132
Call signs for safety.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.656
Daito.

42:51.699 --> 42:53.614
You're Daito.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.181
Hey, baby.

42:55.224 --> 42:57.183
And who are you?

42:57.226 --> 42:58.924
I'm Little Brave Man.

42:58.967 --> 43:01.622
Oh.

43:02.710 --> 43:04.712
I love
"Little Brave Man."

43:04.756 --> 43:06.888
He picked it
all by himself.

43:06.932 --> 43:11.153
How long have you been with
your sister, Little Brave Man?

43:11.197 --> 43:14.461
Tia Rosita brought me.

43:16.202 --> 43:18.857
Judith...

43:18.900 --> 43:24.079
how are Tia Rosita
and Coco doing?

43:24.123 --> 43:26.647
Okay, I guess.

43:26.691 --> 43:28.214
Better.

43:28.257 --> 43:29.389
How's home?

43:29.432 --> 43:31.173
Anything with
the Whisperers?

43:34.481 --> 43:36.918
We got 'em, Mom.

43:38.224 --> 43:41.227
We got
most of the horde.

43:43.272 --> 43:46.885
Alpha can't
hurt us anymore.

43:49.452 --> 43:52.238
You're doing it again.

43:52.281 --> 43:54.893
You always make that sound
when you're worried.

43:54.936 --> 43:56.155
Do not.

43:56.198 --> 43:57.896
Do, too.

44:01.334 --> 44:03.292
Um...

44:03.336 --> 44:06.034
I found something.

44:07.340 --> 44:09.516
Not what I was looking foron the island,

44:09.559 --> 44:11.997
but something else,
something that...

44:12.040 --> 44:15.827
could be really importantto all of us.

44:17.132 --> 44:19.874
What do you mean?

44:22.094 --> 44:26.098
I found somethingthat belonged to the Brave Man

44:26.141 --> 44:33.322
in a placethat he might've been recently.

44:33.366 --> 44:35.107
I don't knowwhat any of it means yet

44:35.150 --> 44:37.849
or -- or if it means
anything at all.

44:37.892 --> 44:40.765
Mom...

44:40.808 --> 44:43.811
is he alive?

44:45.117 --> 44:48.555
I-I don't know,
baby.

44:48.598 --> 44:50.252
That's what I'm saying.

44:50.296 --> 44:51.906
I-I-I don't know.

44:51.950 --> 44:54.561
But if you think
he's alive,

44:54.604 --> 44:56.215
then you have to
go find him.

44:56.258 --> 44:59.261
No. No. Not now.

44:59.305 --> 45:00.741
You and your brotherneed me,

45:00.785 --> 45:02.612
and everything going onin Alexandria --

45:02.656 --> 45:08.401
Mom,
you have to go.

45:08.444 --> 45:11.230
You have to.

45:14.668 --> 45:17.410
We're okay.

45:17.453 --> 45:21.240
What if
he needs you more?

45:22.676 --> 45:24.417
What if he's trying
to come home, too,

45:24.460 --> 45:26.462
but no one will help?

45:26.506 --> 45:29.248
Ah, God.

45:35.341 --> 45:37.299
If I go...

45:38.910 --> 45:42.348
Whenyou go
and when you find him.

45:42.391 --> 45:45.264
Okay, okay.

45:45.307 --> 45:47.875
When I go...

45:47.919 --> 45:52.184
and find
the Brave Man...

45:54.099 --> 45:57.276
Jeremiah:
We're at the coast.I have to go.

45:57.319 --> 45:58.494
Listen to Uncle Daryl.

45:58.538 --> 46:00.192
I know.

46:03.369 --> 46:05.719
Okay.

46:05.763 --> 46:09.984
Okay, baby girl,
I'm gonna try.

46:11.594 --> 46:13.118
I'm gonna head north.

46:14.423 --> 46:17.165
And I'll try youevery morning on this walkie

46:17.209 --> 46:18.427
for as long as I can.

46:18.471 --> 46:22.214
I'll take it everywhere.

46:23.824 --> 46:27.436
I love you and your brotherso much.

46:27.480 --> 46:29.787
Love you, too, Mom.

46:29.830 --> 46:32.050
Go get him.

46:32.093 --> 46:34.356
Shoto, out.

47:43.991 --> 47:46.646
Wait, wait, wait.

47:48.735 --> 47:50.432
Wait.

47:57.787 --> 48:00.355
Can you help us?

48:00.399 --> 48:03.141
They'll leave
without us.

48:03.184 --> 48:04.838
Who?

48:26.468 --> 48:28.340
Please.

48:29.950 --> 48:32.300
They won't wait for us.

48:39.699 --> 48:42.397
Carl:
Should we help her?

48:44.008 --> 48:47.359
Rick: You wanna
tell us your name?

48:47.402 --> 48:51.363
Who are you?

49:04.593 --> 49:06.944
Come on.
