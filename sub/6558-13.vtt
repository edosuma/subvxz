WEBVTT

00:13.264 --> 00:14.307
Huh?

00:41.000 --> 00:42.376
Uh-oh.

01:30.299 --> 01:34.679
Some fishing trip this turned out
to be. Like, not even a nibble!

01:35.012 --> 01:38.975
Well, it looks like Scooby
isn't giving up yet.

01:43.521 --> 01:47.817
Shaggy, what kind of a creepy
shortcut is Freddy taking?

01:47.984 --> 01:50.152
Search me, but it's creepy.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.905
I didn't know it ran through
such a spooky swamp.

01:53.322 --> 01:56.158
This is the first time
you've ever taken it?

01:56.325 --> 02:01.747
- Yeah, but it's the last time, I hope.
- Oh, brother. We're lost.

02:01.914 --> 02:05.876
Maybe not. Look!
There's someone up ahead.

02:07.295 --> 02:10.214
Let's ask him how to get out of here.

02:12.216 --> 02:14.010
Excuse me.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.888
Kind sir, can you show us the way
to the main road?

02:21.309 --> 02:22.852
Zoinks!

02:23.019 --> 02:25.021
A zombie!

02:25.730 --> 02:27.106
Zombie?

02:42.872 --> 02:46.042
This is Swamp's End.
I don't know where it is...

02:46.208 --> 02:48.878
- but I'm glad we found it.
- Me too.

02:49.045 --> 02:51.756
I'd like to know more
about that zombie.

02:51.922 --> 02:55.259
This looks like the place
where you can find out.

02:56.927 --> 03:02.558
Yes, sirree. As strange as it may seem,
I've seen the zombie you speak of...

03:02.892 --> 03:07.480
and the old witch that brought him
to life with her voodoo magic.

03:08.397 --> 03:12.068
Huh? Voodoo?

03:14.278 --> 03:17.740
You mean there's a witch
living in that swamp too?

03:17.907 --> 03:21.077
Yep. She showed up
about six months ago.

03:21.243 --> 03:25.748
<i>Me and my partner Zeb went into
the swamp to do some frog hunting.</i>

03:27.583 --> 03:32.588
<i>We heard a strange noise,
and that's when we saw her.</i>

03:36.675 --> 03:40.596
Smoke of darkness,
demon of evil...

03:40.763 --> 03:43.099
take the form of the living...

03:43.265 --> 03:46.602
and come forth from the flame!

03:56.195 --> 04:00.658
And ever since then, no one's
ever dared to go into the swamp.

04:01.117 --> 04:04.912
Like, wow.
No wonder this town is deserted.

04:05.287 --> 04:08.124
Yep. Zeb and me
are the only ones left.

04:09.667 --> 04:13.546
And he's so scared,
he won't leave his cabin.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.384
I've never heard of such a thing.

04:19.969 --> 04:22.304
What's with Scooby Doo?

04:23.722 --> 04:28.519
Oh, no! Scooby ate
some jumping beans by mistake.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.488
Scooby, look out!

04:39.655 --> 04:41.073
I can't look.

04:45.077 --> 04:46.495
I'm...

04:46.662 --> 04:48.205
sorry.

04:48.706 --> 04:50.499
Wow! What a mess.

04:50.958 --> 04:54.003
If we can borrow a broom,
we'll clean it up.

04:54.170 --> 04:57.256
While we do, you and Scooby
go to Zeb's place.

04:57.465 --> 05:00.926
Maybe you can find out
something about this mystery.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.513
- You gotta be kidding.
- Yeah, kidding.

05:08.851 --> 05:10.102
We're out of luck.

05:10.478 --> 05:13.689
This is Zeb Perkins' place,
and we found it.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.858
I guess we better go in.

05:17.526 --> 05:21.405
Hello? Anybody home?

05:21.614 --> 05:25.117
- Howdy.
- Like, no one seems to be here, Scoob.

05:26.410 --> 05:30.039
And by the looks of this pad,
I don't blame them.

05:35.586 --> 05:37.213
Thanks a lot.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.549
What was that?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.219
Someone's out there.

05:43.511 --> 05:46.764
- Go see who it is, Scooby.
- Uh-uh.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.642
Okay. We'll, like, flip a coin.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.728
Heads, I win. Tails, you lose.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.439
Okay.

05:55.898 --> 05:58.317
Tails. You lose.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.460
Oh, boy.

06:42.194 --> 06:46.282
Hey, Scooby. I think I found Zeb.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.161
Only I think the witch
found him first.

06:56.250 --> 06:59.587
- This isn't Zeb, Shaggy.
- I thought he shrunk.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.424
No. It's a voodoo do”
that looks like him.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.050
What happened to Zeb?

07:05.217 --> 07:08.596
I don't know, but I'll bet that witch
had something to do with it.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.099
I'd like to know what she
and that zombie are up to.

07:12.266 --> 07:14.935
There's only one place
to find the answer.

07:15.269 --> 07:17.730
Like, in the phone book, I hope.

07:17.980 --> 07:20.691
No, Shaggy. In the swamp.

07:21.233 --> 07:23.319
I had to ask.

07:37.958 --> 07:40.919
Look. It's the witch
and her creepy crony.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.797
Come on. Let's follow them.

07:44.423 --> 07:46.133
Quietly, now.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.307
- They're gone.
- Vanished.

07:53.474 --> 07:56.226
Yeah, but we're on the right trail.
Look.

07:56.477 --> 08:00.648
"Beware of the witch. Go back."

08:03.651 --> 08:06.111
"Enter at your own risk.“

08:06.487 --> 08:07.863
Risk?

08:08.739 --> 08:10.157
Oh, boy.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.834
Well, the trail led us
to the witch's shack.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.045
Yeah, but no witch.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.172
But plenty of witch's wares.

08:25.506 --> 08:29.259
Look, here's some more
of those crazy voodoo dolls.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.387
And they look just like us.

08:31.553 --> 08:33.555
She's trying to scare us off.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.349
Well, it won't work.

08:35.516 --> 08:40.020
That voodoo stuff
is just a bunch of phony-baloney.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.356
Shaggy, voodoo.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.526
Yow! I've been voodooed!

08:45.693 --> 08:47.361
Hold it, Shaggy.

08:48.028 --> 08:50.656
All you did was back into this fork.

09:01.667 --> 09:08.215
So you dared enter the swamp
in spite of my warning signs.

09:08.424 --> 09:11.051
You shouldn't believe
everything you read.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.553
WITCH.
No, my pretty?

09:12.886 --> 09:17.182
I think you meddlers must be taught
a lesson in witchcraft.

09:17.349 --> 09:21.311
Smoke of evil, make her vanish!

09:23.856 --> 09:24.898
Daphne!

09:31.238 --> 09:34.700
Poor Daphne.
Gone forever in a puff of smoke.

09:37.745 --> 09:41.373
Yeah. All that's left
are her footprints on that rug.

09:41.540 --> 09:44.752
There's something funny
about those footprints.

09:45.043 --> 09:47.921
Look how they slide back
to the edge of the rug.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.592
- That can only mean one thing.
- She had big feet?

09:51.925 --> 09:57.389
No, silly. She slid down through
a trap door in the floor.

10:01.268 --> 10:05.314
- So that's how it works.
- But then what happened to Daphne?

10:05.481 --> 10:08.108
- I don't know.
- Shaggy.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.235
- Footprints.
- Footprints?

10:10.402 --> 10:11.987
Look what Scooby found!

10:12.154 --> 10:15.115
- I wonder where they go.
- Let's follow them.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.660
Maybe they can lead us to the answer.
Come on.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.920
- Zowie.
- Look at that.

10:28.128 --> 10:32.841
- An old, derelict riverboat.
- Those footprints lead to it.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.134
Look! Look!

10:36.011 --> 10:39.765
- It's the zombie's boat.
- Get a load of that boat pole.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.768
Like, it's got a kooky
metal tip on it.

10:42.935 --> 10:45.270
I wonder what the tip is used for.

10:45.604 --> 10:48.690
For more than just pushing
that boat around, I bet.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.984
Let's go aboard
and hope we can find Daphne.

10:59.284 --> 11:03.121
Every time we split up,
it's like I'm stuck with you.

11:03.497 --> 11:07.709
Now, do something
about those chattering teeth.

11:10.504 --> 11:11.672
Now, stop that.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.634
Don't be such a fraidy cat.
Come on.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.553
<i>Freddy cat?</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:25.519
- I wonder what's inside this deck box.
- Look.

11:25.978 --> 11:29.147
Hey, there's a pair of shoes in here.

11:29.731 --> 11:32.860
And look what they're attached to!

11:41.618 --> 11:43.036
Zoinks!

12:13.942 --> 12:15.861
Hey, a full house.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.030
Gee, thanks a lo... Yipe!

12:36.673 --> 12:38.175
Call her again, Freddy.

12:38.342 --> 12:40.552
Daphne? Daphne?

12:42.304 --> 12:43.472
Hey, did you hear that?

12:43.639 --> 12:48.518
- It's coming from the other side.
- I wonder if there's a secret entrance.

12:48.685 --> 12:51.730
Maybe pulling on this lamp
will open one.

12:51.897 --> 12:55.859
It always works in the movies.
Whoops!

13:03.659 --> 13:06.453
I never saw it done that way
in a movie.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.538
It must have been in a soap opera.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.546
- What's that?
- Yikes! A ghost.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.638
That... sounds like Daphne.

13:25.222 --> 13:27.224
It is Daphne.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.812
Boy, am I glad to see you.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.606
- How did you get here?
- Let me guess.

13:34.773 --> 13:37.943
Big and creepy
brought you here, right?

13:38.110 --> 13:42.239
- None other.
- Look what else we found here.

13:42.781 --> 13:45.659
A winch, power tools
and a cutting torch.

13:45.826 --> 13:49.454
What would a witch
want with a winch in a swamp?

13:49.621 --> 13:53.291
A metal-tipped pole and a winch...

13:53.458 --> 13:55.419
I think I've got it.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.589
What?

14:03.927 --> 14:06.304
Hey, look! Wow, run!

14:13.103 --> 14:15.647
Quick! Down this coal chute.

14:22.821 --> 14:26.616
We would have to land in a coal pile.

14:26.783 --> 14:30.287
Well, at least we got away
from that witch.

14:35.751 --> 14:40.380
The coast is clear.
Okay. Now, keep it quiet.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.514
I got a baldheaded shadow.

14:50.015 --> 14:51.975
Two shadows?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.855
Yipe! Get lost!

14:58.523 --> 15:00.025
In here!

15:05.072 --> 15:10.535
Toads and snails and puppy-dog tails,
that's what zombies are made of.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.997
Sugar and spice and everything nice...

15:14.206 --> 15:18.210
that's what ugly, old witches
are made of.

15:21.797 --> 15:24.341
Hey, Scoob, I think we fooled him.

15:24.716 --> 15:26.093
Yeah.

15:27.219 --> 15:30.722
- Dumb zombie.
- Yeah, dumb zombie.

15:34.810 --> 15:39.106
Hmm... Yipe! Shaggy, help!

15:39.523 --> 15:41.858
Zoinks! He's got Scooby!

15:48.365 --> 15:50.200
Help! Help!

15:50.450 --> 15:54.579
Hang on, Scoob.
Here's a Scooby Snack to the rescue.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.709
Scooby Doo!

16:01.878 --> 16:04.631
- Let go!
- Huh?

16:04.840 --> 16:07.134
Hey!

16:13.306 --> 16:15.559
Go back.

16:19.646 --> 16:23.567
We're trapped between
those two gruesomes.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.071
Look! The witch's broom.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.408
Look, we win.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.494
Let's fly out of here, Scoob.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.496
I'm with you!

16:39.166 --> 16:42.752
Look. It's the witch.
She's got Scooby in that boat.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.713
Let's get her!

16:45.422 --> 16:48.842
Hold on tight. Don't let her go!

16:49.009 --> 16:51.678
Hold it. Stop. It's me!

16:51.928 --> 16:54.848
- Shaggy.
- We thought you were the witch.

16:55.015 --> 16:58.018
Hey, look. This is an airboat.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.396
What's it doing in this
half-flooded riverboat?

17:01.563 --> 17:05.942
I don't know, but let's borrow it
and bust out of here.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.031
There's the exit.

17:12.449 --> 17:15.452
Zoinks! Look who's guarding it.

17:17.120 --> 17:19.206
Help! Help! She got me!

17:19.414 --> 17:21.458
- Get her off!
- Wait a minute.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.961
That's only a sheet painted
to look like a witch.

17:25.420 --> 17:29.216
- Her head is just a balloon.
- That's what made her fly.

17:29.674 --> 17:32.969
Swell. Now how about stopping
this crazy craft?

17:33.428 --> 17:36.473
I can't stop it.
The throttle's stuck.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.475
I'll stop it.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.941
Wow. What a stop.

17:46.107 --> 17:50.570
You mean, "What a catch."
Look what the anchor hooked.

17:50.737 --> 17:54.991
Yeah. Like, an armored-type car.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.996
Wow. Look at all the sacks of money.

18:00.163 --> 18:03.291
There must be
a million dollars in there.

18:03.667 --> 18:07.087
So that's it.
Those creeps were after this money.

18:07.337 --> 18:09.506
Well then, let's give it to them.

18:09.673 --> 18:11.508
GROUP Huh?

18:14.844 --> 18:17.430
Look. The money.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.644
Money, money, money!

18:29.734 --> 18:33.697
Here, double-ugly. Go buy yourself
a new face. Ta-ta!

18:35.782 --> 18:37.617
Let's go, Scooby!

18:40.370 --> 18:43.331
Is the cart set up?
Here they come.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.251
- It's all set.
- We're ready down here.

18:46.543 --> 18:50.547
- Now what'll we do?
- When I yell "duck," dive aside.

18:52.966 --> 18:55.010
Now we've got you.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.636
Duck!

19:05.061 --> 19:07.480
Oh, no. Scooby goofed.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.649
I'II un-goof him.

19:11.276 --> 19:12.652
Got him.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.822
And we've got them.

19:19.409 --> 19:23.330
Thanks to that fast fishing team
of Shaggy and Scooby.

19:23.747 --> 19:24.914
Yeah.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.042
Scooby Doo!

19:30.295 --> 19:31.880
I gotta hand it to you.

19:32.047 --> 19:35.592
Finding that missing armored car
after all these years...

19:36.009 --> 19:40.263
- But who are these two?
- Don't you recognize them?

19:40.430 --> 19:41.931
Why, it's Zeb and Zeke.

19:42.349 --> 19:46.227
They hijacked the armored car
and sunk it in the swamp.

19:46.394 --> 19:50.899
They waited till it was safe
to look for it, but couldn't find it.

19:51.107 --> 19:55.403
So they invented this
act to keep people away.

19:55.570 --> 19:58.740
While they searched the swamp
with the metal-tipped pole.

19:59.115 --> 20:03.203
The pole would make a metallic sound
when it hit the car.

20:03.370 --> 20:06.331
And then they'd pull it up
with the winch.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.377
They had us fooled for a while with a
smokescreen trick. Show them, Velma.

20:10.835 --> 20:14.631
Zeke, the witch, could appear
and vanish as if by magic...

20:14.839 --> 20:17.133
behind a cover
of smoke. Watch.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.890
They sure had everything figured out.

20:24.057 --> 20:28.853
But where they're going, their
disappearing act will never work.

20:30.397 --> 20:35.151
What started out as a fishing trip
sure ended in a dandy mystery.

20:35.360 --> 20:38.154
- What's Scooby doing?
- He's still fishing.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.615
Come on, Scoob. Give up.

20:40.782 --> 20:44.661
You're not gonna catch anything
in that bucket of water.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.165
Finally!

20:49.332 --> 20:51.167
Lookie, lookie, lookie!

20:55.380 --> 20:58.341
That's one fish story
no one will believe.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.635
Scooby Doo!

21:19.654 --> 21:20.864
Huh?
