WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:02.470
- Next is a Bravo
original comedy.

00:04.004 --> 00:06.240
- So what is Miles doing
for camp?

00:06.274 --> 00:08.676
- Camp?
You mean, like, next summer?

00:08.709 --> 00:10.044
I have no idea.

00:10.078 --> 00:12.246
My kids are still sunburned
from Labor Day.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.847
- Well, you better hurry.

00:13.881 --> 00:15.516
There's only one spot left
at Dalton Summer,

00:15.549 --> 00:17.651
and BJ is dying
for Miles to go with him

00:17.685 --> 00:19.820
for some reason.
- I'll look into it.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.390
- And what about Halloween?
What is Miles going to be?

00:22.423 --> 00:25.359
- Uh, either Luke Skywalker
or a wad of gum.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.660
He can't decide.

00:26.694 --> 00:29.197
- Well, BJ is going
as Aaron Burr.

00:29.230 --> 00:31.532
He is obsessed with "Hamilton."

00:31.565 --> 00:34.168
- Oh, wow, that pistol
looks really real.

00:34.202 --> 00:36.036
- Yeah.
- But he hasn't seen it?

00:36.070 --> 00:37.771
- Of course.
Twice.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.707
Our whole family is obsessed.

00:39.740 --> 00:43.244
That show changed my life.

00:43.277 --> 00:45.846
I mean, didn't it
change your life?

00:45.879 --> 00:47.548
- Oh, my God, are you guys
talking about "Hamilton"?

00:47.581 --> 00:49.683
- Yes.
- I've seen it four times,

00:49.717 --> 00:51.519
and every time I feel changed.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.954
Like, I'm actually
a different woman

00:53.987 --> 00:55.256
with a different family

00:55.289 --> 00:57.791
and a very different husband.

00:57.825 --> 00:58.892
You know what I mean.

00:58.926 --> 01:00.761
- No, I haven't seen it.

01:00.794 --> 01:03.497
- I'm sorry, what?
- Not even once?

01:03.531 --> 01:05.032
- I haven't seen it.

01:05.133 --> 01:06.534
I haven't seen "Hamilton."

01:06.567 --> 01:08.769
[all gasp]
- You have to see it.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.205
all: You have to see it.
You have to see it.

01:11.239 --> 01:12.840
You have to see it.
- You absolutely have to see it.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.775
[rock music]

01:14.808 --> 01:17.445
- * Hey, yes, you know

01:17.478 --> 01:20.881
* I'm feeling fine,
I'm feeling fine *

01:20.914 --> 01:22.683
- What is the deal
with "Hamilton"?

01:22.716 --> 01:24.385
People are apeshit.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.654
It's like "Frozen" for adults.
- I know.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.157
I was shamed by a patient
'cause I hadn't seen it.

01:29.190 --> 01:31.159
She had third-degree burns
all over her body,

01:31.192 --> 01:32.960
but she felt really bad for me.

01:32.993 --> 01:34.828
- [laughs]
Everyone's saying

01:34.862 --> 01:36.630
it's "life-changing."

01:36.664 --> 01:38.732
How?
Does Alexander Hamilton

01:38.766 --> 01:40.834
climb off the stage
and chow your box?

01:40.868 --> 01:42.870
- [laughs]
He must.

01:44.172 --> 01:46.006
I kinda wanna see it.
- Me too.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.309
There was a day way back when
I was gonna get tickets,

01:48.342 --> 01:49.677
and then I forgot,

01:49.710 --> 01:52.012
and then it blew up
so I decided it must suck.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.747
- Totally,
And now that it's impossible

01:53.781 --> 01:56.484
to get tickets,
I'm 100% sure I'd hate it.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.186
In fact, I hate it already.
- Yeah, but what if

01:58.219 --> 01:59.853
we're missing out
on quality entertainment

01:59.887 --> 02:01.789
because we think we're cooler
than everyone else?

02:01.822 --> 02:03.557
- Well, we are cooler
than everyone else,

02:03.591 --> 02:06.194
but I do have
some entertainment regrets.

02:06.194 --> 02:08.496
Remember we skipped Nirvana
at Irving Plaza?

02:08.529 --> 02:09.963
- Well, I hate general admission

02:09.997 --> 02:12.466
and I thought
we'd catch their next tour.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.567
Sorry.

02:13.601 --> 02:15.236
- I blew off Pope Francis.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.970
His first visit here
was like the second coming.

02:17.004 --> 02:18.772
- Well, I am here to say,

02:18.806 --> 02:21.108
"Game of Thrones,"
not overhyped.

02:21.209 --> 02:23.611
- Then let's see "Hamilton"
before it's "Disney on Ice."

02:23.644 --> 02:25.679
Get out your wall calendar.
[cell phone chimes]

02:25.713 --> 02:27.415
[growls]
- What?

02:27.448 --> 02:30.218
- Elliot signed me up for this
"Texts of Joy" thing.

02:30.218 --> 02:33.754
One nauseatingly positive
thought every day.

02:33.787 --> 02:35.456
"Life isn't about
finding yourself.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.591
It's about creating yourself."
- Barf.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.527
Is that from
that "Joy Manifesto" hag?

02:39.560 --> 02:42.029
- Yes.
Thank you, Brooke von Weber.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.265
Right after she gave me her
handbag at your break-fast,

02:44.298 --> 02:46.634
she gave Elliot
that insipid book.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.136
- She giveth
and she taketh away.

02:49.237 --> 02:51.138
So just to recap
our hype policy:

02:51.239 --> 02:53.006
"Hamilton," yes.

02:53.040 --> 02:55.609
"Joy Manifesto," never.

02:55.643 --> 02:58.679
- Sorry, did I hear you talking
about "Hamilton"?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.047
Isn't it life-changing?

03:00.080 --> 03:01.782
both: We haven't seen it.
- Oh.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.385
- We were just about
to order tickets for the 2020s.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.520
- Too bad you'll miss
Lin-Manuel Miranda.

03:06.554 --> 03:07.921
Tonight's his last night.

03:07.955 --> 03:09.623
He's leaving
to work on his next opus

03:09.657 --> 03:11.259
about Spiro Agnew, I think.

03:11.259 --> 03:13.627
- Oh, well, there goes that.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.396
We snoozed.
We losed.

03:15.429 --> 03:16.930
- Wait a minute,
how did you get tickets?

03:16.964 --> 03:18.466
- Oh, I'm friends
with one of the actors.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.134
Javier Munoz.
No?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.604
Well, he gets tickets
to every show.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.373
It's a long shot,
but I can see

03:25.406 --> 03:27.140
if he hasn't already
gotten rid of his tickets yet.

03:27.174 --> 03:30.043
- Oh, my God,
you are Zeus from on high.

03:30.077 --> 03:34.282
Okay, I'm writing my number,
and here's my email,

03:34.282 --> 03:37.751
my mailing address,
and my bank log-in just in case.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.920
- [laughs]
Okay.

03:39.953 --> 03:41.289
- I love him.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.490
- Yeah, that's not happening.

03:42.523 --> 03:43.924
If we want a real shot at this,

03:43.957 --> 03:45.826
I think we have to take
to the streets.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.495
- Okay.
You take Facebook,

03:47.528 --> 03:49.330
I'll Instagram,
and we'll both tweet

03:49.363 --> 03:52.300
to our 38 followers
from college.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.934
- I really appreciate you
putting up with everything

03:53.967 --> 03:56.003
my kid said, did,
and smelt like back there.

03:56.036 --> 03:57.638
I'm giving you
a five-star rating.

03:57.671 --> 03:59.473
- It wasn't a problem, sir.
I--you know what?

03:59.507 --> 04:01.875
I'll give you a five too.
- Right, passengers get rated.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.744
Now, what do you rate them on?
- Not much.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.379
If they're nice enough
I give them a five.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.514
- Oh.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.382
Can I see what my rating is?

04:08.416 --> 04:10.751
- Yeah, sure, I guess.

04:10.784 --> 04:14.087
It's, uh, 4.7.
That's good.

04:14.121 --> 04:16.657
- 4.7 out of 5?
- Yeah.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.192
- So there's a driver
who didn't give me a five?

04:19.226 --> 04:22.330
- It's an average, Daddy.
It could be more than one.

04:22.363 --> 04:24.097
[melancholy rock music]

04:24.131 --> 04:27.234

We're going to be late.

Nice work.

04:34.141 --> 04:35.743
Now for some breaking news.

04:35.776 --> 04:37.711
As you know
from my vision boards,

04:37.745 --> 04:39.347
it's been my number one goal

04:39.380 --> 04:42.350
to get von Weber featured
on BagBitch.net.

04:42.350 --> 04:44.352
- So much better
than BagBitch.com.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.754
- Right?
My computer's set to auto-buy

04:46.787 --> 04:48.522
her "Bag of the Week"
every Monday.

04:48.556 --> 04:51.158
- Well, drum roll, please.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.464
J'neece, I was hoping you could
do something rhythmic.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.366
- Okay, uh...
- Yeah.

05:01.402 --> 05:04.271
[gasps]
So tribal.

05:04.372 --> 05:07.040
I scored a meeting
with Ila Davingsly,

05:07.074 --> 05:08.542
the Bag Bitch herself,

05:08.576 --> 05:11.379
to pitch a von Weber bag
to be "Bag of the Week."

05:11.379 --> 05:12.846
- A personal meeting?

05:12.880 --> 05:14.782
She doesn't do that
with emerging brands.

05:14.815 --> 05:18.151
- All I know is she is in town
and she's squeezing me in

05:18.185 --> 05:19.553
between a shoot for "W"

05:19.587 --> 05:21.389
and a non-eating luncheon
with Stella McCartney.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.491
- I'll call in your facialist
and synergy coach.

05:23.524 --> 05:25.793
- And I'll cancel your AKTE.
- Thanks.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.462
The last time I had this much
riding on a meeting was

05:28.496 --> 05:31.198
when Lex brought me home
to meet Candace and Fielding.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.468
I miss Fielding.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.003
Oh!

in sharkskin for spring?

Instagram peeps said

05:44.878 --> 05:46.680
they got tickets at TKTS.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.248
It's like reverse psychology.

anyone would look.

Hi.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.854
Any chance you have two tickets

05:53.887 --> 05:55.155
for "Hamilton" tonight?

05:55.188 --> 05:56.690
- Preferably orchestra.

We get it.

06:08.101 --> 06:09.903
- NFW!

06:09.937 --> 06:12.305
Elliot's saying he can help
get us "Hamilton" tickets.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.575
- Seriously? How?
- I don't know.

06:14.608 --> 06:16.343
Maybe one of his real estate
clients has a connection.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.511
Who cares?

I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.990
Unfortunately,
another meeting ran long

06:30.023 --> 06:32.593
and Miss Davingsly won't be able
to meet with you after all.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.528
- What?
Not even for a few minutes?

06:34.562 --> 06:36.797
Just to introduce myself?
- I'm afraid not.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.932
She's quite booked
and already on her way out,

06:38.966 --> 06:41.935

if you're in here,
I wouldn't normally do this,

06:59.152 --> 07:01.755
but I couldn't bear not meeting
you while you were in town.

07:03.123 --> 07:06.494
- Everybody out.
You can take the stairs.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.931

- This is ridiculous.

- How many floors is this?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.735

- Ugh!

Just go!

07:21.575 --> 07:24.778

[laughs softly]

07:24.812 --> 07:27.147
First of all,
it is such an honor

07:27.180 --> 07:28.916
to meet you, Miss Davingsly.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.519
- 18, 17...

07:31.519 --> 07:35.288
- We're not only a handbag line,
we are a brand experience

07:35.322 --> 07:37.658
that conveys intention,
confidence,

07:37.691 --> 07:40.594
and subtle superiority.
- Price point?

07:40.628 --> 07:42.896
- I believe a handbag
should be accessible.

07:42.930 --> 07:45.332
Mine start at 2,900.

Now, what can I do
to get "The Shipley"

07:48.268 --> 07:49.737
to be "Bag of the Week?"

07:49.770 --> 07:51.939
- I'm just a girl
from Muncie, Indiana,

07:51.972 --> 07:54.307
and I told my mom that
for my first trip here,

07:54.341 --> 07:57.578
I want the quintessential
New York experience.

see "Hamilton,"

through Central Park.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.251
- That's adorable.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.720
- And I want to do it all
on molly.

08:06.754 --> 08:08.355
I didn't tell my mom that part.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.591
- Molly?
You mean the drug?

08:10.624 --> 08:12.560
- The guy who was supposed
to get it for me

08:12.560 --> 08:15.228
got stuck upstate
in apple-picking traffic.

- Hi.

08:42.389 --> 08:43.957
- Let me find you a place
to sit down.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.926
- No offense,
but this'll just be a drive-by.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.327
How much do we owe you
for the tickets?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.596
- What?

08:48.629 --> 08:50.598
No, I don't have the tickets.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.165
I meant I can help you get them

08:52.199 --> 08:54.001
by doing
a manifestation visualization.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.837
- [exhales sharply]
You did not bring us here

08:56.870 --> 08:59.272
for a "Joy Manifesto" thing.
No.

08:59.306 --> 09:02.943
- Does it matter to you one iota
that the "Joy Manifesto"

09:02.976 --> 09:05.613
helped me sell
three apartments yesterday?

09:05.613 --> 09:08.181
And when I do
positive visualizations,

09:08.215 --> 09:11.685
I never wait for the subway.
Not even the G train.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.420
[laughing]
That can't just be luck.

09:13.453 --> 09:15.022
- Oh, my God, he's serious.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.690
A thousand apologies.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.627
- Wow.
You're so deeply negative.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.530
With this attitude, I'm not sure
you deserve to see "Hamilton."

09:23.631 --> 09:25.465
- [laughs]
Do you hear yourself?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.901
- I'm sorry, I think Vanessa's
just having a big reaction

09:27.935 --> 09:30.037
'cause we're kind of
under the gun time-wise,

09:30.070 --> 09:31.939
and we're in longshot-ville
as it is.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.641
- Actually, Vanessa,

09:33.674 --> 09:35.308
I'd like to talk to you
about something privately,

09:35.342 --> 09:37.077
if you don't mind.

09:37.110 --> 09:39.246
- Okay, I will be downstairs.

09:39.279 --> 09:42.115
Thank you, anyway, Elliot.

09:42.149 --> 09:44.384
[upbeat music]

09:44.417 --> 09:50.090
all: * The wheels on Syed's Uber
go round and round... *

09:50.123 --> 09:52.893
- No, sir.
Which way do you want to go?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.228
all: * Round and round

09:55.262 --> 09:57.297
* Round and round

09:57.330 --> 09:59.900
- I mean, not working has been
eye-opening, actually,

09:59.933 --> 10:01.735
if a little tedious.

10:01.769 --> 10:07.675
all: * The wheels on Syed's Uber
go round and round... *

10:07.708 --> 10:10.510
- These brownies are made
with applesauce

10:10.543 --> 10:12.112
instead of oil, by the way.

10:12.145 --> 10:13.747
Promise you won't miss it.

10:13.781 --> 10:15.515
*

10:15.548 --> 10:20.187
all: * All through the town

10:20.220 --> 10:23.290
- A 4.1?
My score's gone down!

10:23.323 --> 10:24.792
How's that possible?

10:27.360 --> 10:30.630
- Hey, I just realized
I'm mutual Facebook friends

10:30.664 --> 10:33.433
with the actor who plays Rafiki
in "The Lion King."

10:33.466 --> 10:35.268
Should I poke him?

10:35.302 --> 10:36.303
What's wrong?

10:36.336 --> 10:37.805
- Elliot just dumped me.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.539
Said he couldn't
visualize a future

10:39.572 --> 10:40.774
with someone so negative.

10:40.808 --> 10:43.711
- What?
He dumped you?

10:43.744 --> 10:46.947
[mimicking robot]
Does not compute.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.216
- I mean, I wasn't
in love with him or anything,

10:49.249 --> 10:51.985
but still,
I'm just a little stunned.

10:52.019 --> 10:53.954
- Trust me,
it's all for the best.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.857
You don't need that kind
of positive energy in your life.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.226
Anyway, I have a better idea
how we can get Hammy tickets.

10:59.259 --> 11:00.794
Come on.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.262
[phone rings]
- What makes you think Lex is

11:02.295 --> 11:03.596
gonna have "Hamilton" tickets?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.232
- Hello, haven't you
seen "Billions"?

11:05.265 --> 11:06.734
Hedge fund guys rule the world.

11:06.767 --> 11:08.802
- Jill E. Beans!

11:08.836 --> 11:11.604
- Hey.
- And the friend!

11:11.638 --> 11:13.073
- Vanessa.

11:13.106 --> 11:15.242
- You guys here
for a tour of my roof hives?

11:15.275 --> 11:17.610
- Roof hives?
- Did you know that bees play

11:17.644 --> 11:19.880
a crucial role
in the environment?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.481
I call them my Hercu-bees.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.483
- Okay, I'm just gonna
cut to the chase.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.118
We're dying to see "Hamilton."

11:25.152 --> 11:26.653
Like, on life support about it.

11:26.754 --> 11:28.421
- You guys haven't
seen "Hamilton" yet?

11:28.455 --> 11:31.224
I saw it twice last month.
It changed my life,

11:31.258 --> 11:33.326
but then the second time
it changed back,

11:33.360 --> 11:34.995
so I'm going again.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.764
- Any chance you can
help us get tix?

11:36.797 --> 11:39.632
- Of course, I keep two spares
on me at all times.

11:39.666 --> 11:41.468
I nabbed these
at a charity auction

11:41.501 --> 11:44.037
along with that portrait
of Hercules Mulligan.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.174
It'll make more sense
after you see the show.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.509
- Lex, these tickets are
for December.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.778
We have to go tonight.
- [exhales]

11:50.811 --> 11:52.479
- It's LMM's last performance.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.615
- Tonight?
KY-Jilly, no can do.

11:55.648 --> 11:59.252
Have you tried
a manifestation visualization?

11:59.286 --> 12:02.856
The "Joy Manifesto" is
how I landed my last two deals.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.657
[cell phone buzzes]

12:04.691 --> 12:07.594
Ernie, tell me
we got that new jet.

12:07.627 --> 12:10.663
It is such an upgrade.
- Who are we not thinking of?

12:10.697 --> 12:12.499
Come on, this is the greatest
city in the world.

12:12.532 --> 12:14.101
[bell rings]
Come on, come on, come on.

12:14.134 --> 12:16.804
- I know.
It's been so long.

12:16.804 --> 12:18.939
Anyway, am I dreaming
or did your mother

12:18.972 --> 12:21.108
have something to do
with the "Hamilton" publicity?

12:21.141 --> 12:23.110
No?
- Well, I just loved

12:23.143 --> 12:24.611
your cover shot
of Lin-Manuel Miranda

12:24.644 --> 12:26.379
for the "Times Magazine."

12:26.413 --> 12:28.548
[bell dings]
- I'm so, so sorry.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.183
Well, that's
an excellent hospital.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.584
I did my residency there.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.220
She's in good hands...
[mouthing]

12:33.253 --> 12:34.587
- What?

12:34.621 --> 12:36.824
Everyone is pumping you
for tickets?

12:36.824 --> 12:39.259
That is so ass-holic.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.061
I hate people.
[bell dings]

12:41.094 --> 12:43.596
- Right, but didn't you go to
Hunter with Lin-Manuel Miranda?

12:43.630 --> 12:45.032
Wesleyan?

12:45.065 --> 12:46.433
SAT prep class?

12:46.466 --> 12:47.968
[growls]

12:48.001 --> 12:49.736
Andy's not related
to Andrew Lloyd Webber, is he?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.371
[cell phone ringing]
- No, he's two Bs.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.873
Hello?

12:52.906 --> 12:54.574
I'm sorry, who?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.077
No way!
The waiter.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.146
Okay.
- Thanks anyway, talk soon.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.281
- Yes.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.983
You are an actual god.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.185
Start a religion,
and I will convert.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.054
Okay.

13:07.087 --> 13:09.322
Javier whoever's accountant
has food poisoning,

13:09.356 --> 13:11.158
and he said on Facebook he's
giving the tickets

13:11.191 --> 13:13.393
to the first person
that gets to his office.

13:13.426 --> 13:15.528
- Do you think we
manifested his food poisoning?

13:15.562 --> 13:17.865
Shit on a stick!
- The four, five, and six

13:17.865 --> 13:19.066
cannot all be down.

13:19.099 --> 13:20.367
All right, we gotta get an Uber.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.869
- You know how I feel
about Uber.

13:21.869 --> 13:23.303
- That was one incident.

13:23.336 --> 13:26.206
- It was $145 from the High Line
to my apartment.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.975
I could have rented
a helicopter for that.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.342
- It was New Year's Eve.

13:29.376 --> 13:31.879
You have to understand
how surge pricing works.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.713
I'm calling one.

13:33.746 --> 13:36.483
Shit!
Andy must be using our account.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.652
- You keep the car so clean.
Smooth on the brake.

13:39.686 --> 13:41.421
[cell phone rings]
You're--oh, uh, so sorry.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.390
It's the wife.
You two would love each other.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.492
Maybe double date next week.

13:45.525 --> 13:47.394
Hi, hon.
- Andy, I don't have time

13:47.427 --> 13:49.897
to explain, but you've got to
get out of the Uber right now.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.899
It's a pop culture emergency.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.034
- Jill, I can't.
Our Uber rating is down.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.903
Way down.
I have to get it back up.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.170
- What?
What happened?

13:57.204 --> 13:58.405
- I don't know,
but given the fact

13:58.438 --> 13:59.739
that you refuse
to learn to drive,

13:59.772 --> 14:01.241
I'd suggest we do everything

14:01.274 --> 14:03.110
in our power
to save this relationship.

14:03.143 --> 14:05.178
- Okay, fine, just fix it.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.947
- [gasps]
Shit! Look!

14:06.980 --> 14:08.748
Someone else is heading
for the tickets!

14:08.781 --> 14:10.951
Double shit!
I accidentally liked it.

14:10.984 --> 14:13.954
- Okay, we gotta figure out
another way to get downtown.

14:13.987 --> 14:16.990
What are those yellow things
we used to take?

14:18.225 --> 14:19.993
This is so retro.

14:20.027 --> 14:22.462
- Yeah, it's like being
in a covered wagon.

14:22.495 --> 14:25.165
Look at the meter,
and the divider.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.300
[sighs]
A money slot thing.

14:27.334 --> 14:29.036
I remember these.
- Yeah, but I'd forgotten

14:29.069 --> 14:30.837
about the B.O.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.372
- [gasps]
Oh, no!

14:32.405 --> 14:34.041
Four more people are
going after our tickets.

14:34.074 --> 14:35.508
[cell phone ringing]
- Wait.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.945
Ugh!

14:37.945 --> 14:39.446
[groans]

14:39.479 --> 14:41.514
Hey, Brooke,
um, I can't talk right now.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.483
We're desperately seeking
"Hamilton" tickets.

14:43.516 --> 14:46.053
- Oh, yeah, J'neece told me
you hadn't seen it.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.988
I feel so empty for you.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.723
Hey, do you want me to see
if she could get you tickets?

14:50.757 --> 14:52.792
- Why, does Janice have
a "Hamilton" connection?

14:52.825 --> 14:54.694
- Well, she's very plugged
into hip-hop,

14:54.727 --> 14:57.364
but not drugs, unfortunately.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.701
Do you know
where one could score drugs?

15:01.734 --> 15:05.973
- Um, 17 years ago people got
them at Tompkins Square Park,

15:06.006 --> 15:08.575
I think.
- You want me to go to da Bronx?

15:08.608 --> 15:11.078
- Look at a map, Brooke.
Okay, bye.

15:11.111 --> 15:13.280
- [growls]
One of our ticket cockblockers

15:13.313 --> 15:14.781
just posted that
she's four blocks away,

15:14.814 --> 15:16.383
and running in sneakers!

15:16.416 --> 15:18.986
- Oh, my God, on Prancer,
on Dancer, on Blitzen!

15:18.986 --> 15:21.588
[mimics whip cracking]
[car horn honks]

15:21.621 --> 15:23.090
We're not moving.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.291
All right,
on second thought, sir,

15:24.324 --> 15:25.325
I think we're just gonna
get out.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.094
Okay, thank you.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.129
- Jill, we have to pay!
It's not Uber, we have to pay!

15:29.162 --> 15:30.330
- Shit!
I forgot about that.

15:30.363 --> 15:32.199
What a hassle.

15:33.666 --> 15:34.801
Okay.

15:34.834 --> 15:35.902
Why are the buttons not
responding?

15:36.003 --> 15:37.137
Am I not a human temperature?

15:37.170 --> 15:39.006
- Look, just--
[gasps]

15:39.006 --> 15:40.640
It tipped $9,000!

15:40.673 --> 15:41.808
Just go!
- Okay, okay.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.243
- I'll catch up.
- Okay.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.245

15:45.278 --> 15:47.247
Run like the wind!

15:51.018 --> 15:51.318
[rock music]

15:53.086 --> 15:55.122
- We're here.
- Do you have the tickets?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.057
- You're too late.
- No!

15:57.090 --> 15:59.492
- [vomiting]
[both groaning and gagging]

15:59.526 --> 16:01.428
- Oh, my God.
- You're killing us!

16:01.461 --> 16:02.762
- [groans and vomits]
- Feel better!

16:02.795 --> 16:05.765

16:07.300 --> 16:08.635
- Molly?

16:08.668 --> 16:10.037
Molly?

16:10.037 --> 16:12.472
Molly?
Molly, molly?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.873
Molly?

16:13.906 --> 16:15.608
Oh, molly?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.077
Excuse me,

16:17.110 --> 16:20.547
do you have any drugs
I might buy?

16:20.580 --> 16:21.781
- We're on a date.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.716
- And I'm a federal prosecutor.

16:23.750 --> 16:26.219
- Oh, just kidding.

16:26.253 --> 16:28.455
Inside joke.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.164
Excuse me, sir,
do you happen to know

16:37.197 --> 16:40.933
where I might find some...
illegal drugs?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.435
- Not interested.

16:42.469 --> 16:44.304
- Lady, you're
embarrassing yourself.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.505
Follow me.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.973
*

16:47.074 --> 16:48.175
I got it all:

16:48.208 --> 16:51.278
Weed, speed, poppers, crank,
crunk,

16:51.311 --> 16:53.180
the discontinued beverage
Clearly Canadian,

16:53.213 --> 16:55.815
Lexapro, "Hamilton" tickets.
What'll it be?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.584
- I'd like to buy a molly,
please.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.952
Or maybe more.
What's a teen dose?

16:59.986 --> 17:01.321
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.323
I don't sell molly to kids.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.692
I'm a drug dealer,
not a criminal.

17:05.725 --> 17:06.993
- You're right.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.929
Ila is just a child.

17:09.962 --> 17:12.232
- No pressure,
but my theater company is

17:12.265 --> 17:15.335
in previews for "Chernow: Life
of the Hamilton Biographer."

17:15.368 --> 17:16.603
- [exhales]

17:16.636 --> 17:18.004
- It's pay what you will.

17:18.105 --> 17:20.840
- I guess we'll never
be satisfied.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.943
- Yeah, we'll have
to wait for it.

17:23.976 --> 17:26.746
So, should we do something else
we always wanted to do,

17:26.779 --> 17:28.014
but never got around to?

17:28.115 --> 17:30.183
- Like try pumpkin-spiced
lattes?

17:30.217 --> 17:33.220
- I do always miss that window.
[cell phone rings]

17:35.755 --> 17:37.790
- [sighs]
Brooke, hi.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.792
I know you think I'm street,

17:39.826 --> 17:43.130
but the only drug that
I can score for you is Advil.

17:43.130 --> 17:46.133
- Jill, I'm about
to change your life.

17:46.166 --> 17:49.436
I know how you can get
"Hamilton" tickets for tonight.

17:49.469 --> 17:52.372
- Please tell me this is not
a "Joy" manifestation.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.274
- It's not, but you do have

17:54.307 --> 17:56.743
to go to a very dangerous part
of the ghetto.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.845
Tell Jason I sent you.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.215
[calming exotic music]

*

18:05.818 --> 18:07.520
Ah!

18:07.554 --> 18:09.622
- Honey, I hope you're
on your way to "Hamilton"

18:09.656 --> 18:11.491
because I have some bad news.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.994
We have been banned...

18:15.027 --> 18:17.397
from Uber.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.166
Please call me.

18:19.199 --> 18:22.202
We can talk about how
we're gonna get through this.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.072
I love you.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.675
[melancholy music]

18:28.708 --> 18:30.677
And I loved Uber.

18:30.710 --> 18:38.718
*

19:01.874 --> 19:04.211
- Hurry, Ila,
the horse and buggy guy said

19:04.211 --> 19:06.813
they get very busy after 5:00,

19:06.846 --> 19:09.216
and tie a sweater
around your waist, please.

19:09.216 --> 19:11.351
It's supposed to get cold.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.220
I'm bringing my hand sanitizer,

19:13.220 --> 19:15.855
so there's no point
bringing yours.

19:15.888 --> 19:18.491
- "Put von Weber
on BagBitch.net

19:18.525 --> 19:21.361
"or I'll tell your mom
about your BFF molly.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.029
"Welcome to New York.

19:23.062 --> 19:25.498
XO B von W."

19:25.532 --> 19:27.367
- Ugh! Bitch!

19:29.236 --> 19:31.103
- I can't believe
we pulled this off.

19:31.137 --> 19:32.439
- I can't believe Brooke
was our hookup.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.806
[machine beeps]
I'm so excited.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.243
- I know.
We're swimming with the stream.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.645
Why did we resist for so long?

19:38.678 --> 19:41.381
[machines beeps quickly]

19:41.414 --> 19:43.015
- Ma'am, I'm afraid
this ticket's not valid.

19:43.049 --> 19:44.484
- What?
- No!

19:44.517 --> 19:46.653
- How could that drug dealer
sell us a fake ticket?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.255
- So unprofessional.

19:49.756 --> 19:51.023
- What do we do?

19:51.057 --> 19:52.392
- You have to see it.

19:52.425 --> 19:54.261
- You must be
out of your goddamn mind.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.629
- Ma'am, I need you
to step to the side, please.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.565
- Really, go.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.999
At least one of us should know

20:00.032 --> 20:02.034
what a "Hamilton"-gasm
feels like.

20:02.068 --> 20:03.836
I'll go home
and binge-watch "Cheers."

20:03.870 --> 20:05.171
People used to love that, right?

20:05.204 --> 20:08.308
- [sighs]
Vaness, I feel so helpless.

20:08.341 --> 20:11.311
[melancholy music]

20:11.344 --> 20:13.646
- Enjoy it.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.047
- [quietly]
No.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.353
- I cannot believe you gave up
your "Hamilton" ticket.

20:22.589 --> 20:24.457
- I can.
It meant so much

20:24.491 --> 20:25.758
to that homeless guy.

20:25.792 --> 20:27.360
- Maybe it'll change his life.

20:27.394 --> 20:29.529
- Yeah, I don't need
my life changed.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.464
I love my life.
- Ditto.

20:31.498 --> 20:33.433
And "Hamilton" wasn't even
a good president, right?

20:33.466 --> 20:36.102
- Vanessa, he was
Secretary of the Treasury.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.404
- Wait, he wasn't
even president

20:37.437 --> 20:38.705
and he gets a whole musical?

20:38.738 --> 20:40.239
- [laughs]

20:40.273 --> 20:41.541
I'll call for tickets tomorrow.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.109
We'll see it when we're 50.

20:43.142 --> 20:46.078
- I'm sure Ricky Martin
will make a great Hamilton.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.584
- Javier Munoz.
No?

20:54.587 --> 20:56.589
- This kid is insane, man.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.459
*

20:59.492 --> 21:00.893
- We're on a date.

21:00.927 --> 21:03.963
*

21:03.996 --> 21:06.165
- And I'm a federal prosecutor.

21:06.198 --> 21:09.035
*

21:09.068 --> 21:11.037
- Excuse me, sir.

21:11.070 --> 21:14.006

21:14.040 --> 21:16.643

to step to the side, please.
