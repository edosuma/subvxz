00:06.330 --> 00:08.400
-Investigating
the disappearance
of Agent Pierce.

00:08.500 --> 00:10.991
-Before you take off,
better burn your passport.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.992
Payment method.
These accounts are empty.

00:14.040 --> 00:15.155
-Uh, excuse me.

00:15.160 --> 00:16.821
This right here
is the real deal.

00:16.830 --> 00:19.196
-Why each of you?

00:19.290 --> 00:21.656
-I'm past due with Jey-Jey.
We need that cash yesterday.

00:21.660 --> 00:23.400
-Gonna have to make a choice,
|i|' homey.

00:24.830 --> 00:27.116
-I took my entire hood's stash,

00:27.160 --> 00:28.491
and I gave it
to this little girl.

00:28.500 --> 00:30.320
That's how much
I believe in GenCoin.

00:30.370 --> 00:32.907
-That... is why.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.781
-You guys hungry?
We're gonna go to dinner.

00:46.660 --> 00:49.322
-Okay, how-- how about
I write you a check?

00:49.370 --> 00:50.997
Get me on a flight,
and cash it when I'm gone.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.446
-You know what I can
do for you. Come on.

01:03.500 --> 01:04.649
You know what I can do to you.

01:06.290 --> 01:07.780
-I need to see the money.

01:13.790 --> 01:16.577
- Door.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.940
I'm just famished.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.194
Oh, good.

01:55.250 --> 01:56.649
-Haven't eaten in a week.
Thank you.

01:56.700 --> 01:58.748
- Startup schedule, huh?
- Yeah. That's it.

01:58.790 --> 01:59.905
Thank you.

01:59.950 --> 02:01.861
Great. So, this is your spot?

02:01.910 --> 02:04.447
Uh, yeah,
when the occasion demands.

02:04.500 --> 02:08.288
-Thanks.
Oh, it demands, Alex.

02:08.330 --> 02:09.991
-Thank you.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.689
-Mr. Bell.
-Hey, Tony.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.900
Lovely to see you.
- Thanks for getting us in
so last minute.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.321
-Ah, we've opened
this lovely bottle
for you tonight.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.658
Superb with our specialty app,
veal and wild mushroom terrine.

02:19.660 --> 02:20.866
Sounds great.

02:20.950 --> 02:22.656
Celebrating
anything special tonight?

02:22.700 --> 02:23.997
-Oh, we are, in fact.

02:24.000 --> 02:25.194
I'm about to tell these three

02:25.290 --> 02:26.826
that I'm gonna fully finance
their startup.

02:26.910 --> 02:28.901
- Wow.
- It's called GenCoin.

02:28.950 --> 02:30.440
It is the future of currency.

02:30.500 --> 02:31.990
That sounds fascinating.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.490
Let's do
two of those bottles?

02:33.500 --> 02:35.365
Absolutely.
And a round
of old fashioneds.

02:35.410 --> 02:37.492
Actually, you know, just Coke
is good for me, dawg.

02:37.540 --> 02:40.828
- Oh, okay.
- Three old fashioneds and a Coke.

02:40.870 --> 02:42.155
Actually,
I'll have a Coke, too.

02:42.200 --> 02:43.747
What the hell?
Coke is delicious.

02:43.790 --> 02:46.327
Absolutely.

02:46.370 --> 02:49.828
Thank you.
- And let's get, like,
one of everything on the menu.

02:49.870 --> 02:51.280
Perfect. Enjoy.

02:53.330 --> 02:55.491
- He's a good waiter.
- Alex, are you serious?

02:55.540 --> 02:58.327
-What do you mean?
-Fully finance?

02:58.330 --> 03:02.699
- Oh. That.
Sure. Why not?

03:02.790 --> 03:04.326
We need to talk about
our funding schedule.

03:04.330 --> 03:05.866
I want to stay ahead
of any competition,

03:05.950 --> 03:07.781
'cause RadCoin launches
In less than a month.

03:07.830 --> 03:09.946
-Yeah, let's talk about it.
-Yeah, but they're
full of bullshit.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.240
You said it yourself.

03:11.290 --> 03:12.655
-First to market,
all that matters.

03:12.750 --> 03:14.741
-That's true. Very important.

03:14.790 --> 03:16.781
- But you know what?
- We could talk about that,

03:16.830 --> 03:18.991
sign some paperwork
in the morning.

03:19.040 --> 03:20.746
- Tonight, let's celebrate.
- That's easy.

03:20.790 --> 03:22.781
- Yeah.
- That's easy.

03:35.870 --> 03:38.361
-Yes. Very nice.
Yeah.

03:38.410 --> 03:39.991
So, you own this place?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.616
-Mm, just the building.
The club came with it.

03:42.660 --> 03:44.116
- Excuse me.
- "Just the building."

03:44.160 --> 03:46.788
Huh.
It's not really my scene,
but hey.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.366
Sometimes it's good
to celebrate.
Right.

03:48.450 --> 03:49.940
You gotta do
what you gotta do.
Yeah.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.991
How long
have you owned it for?

03:54.580 --> 03:56.650
Whoo! Alex!

03:56.660 --> 03:58.946
Woo-hoo!
-Hey, hey.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.865
-Hel_lo.
-Hl.

04:00.910 --> 04:02.696
- Hi, babies.
- Perfect.

04:02.750 --> 04:04.536
Hello, ladies.
Welcome, welcome.

04:04.580 --> 04:06.866
Guys, this is Lucy,
and this is Kristina.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.116
They work the bar downstairs.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.492
- Hi.
- HI.

04:10.540 --> 04:12.030
You guys
finish your shifts already?

04:12.080 --> 04:14.492
-Thank god.
-I'm not even working tonight.

04:14.540 --> 04:15.689
I just came to hang.

04:15.750 --> 04:18.241
-Well, then, I want you
to meet Izzy, Nick,

04:18.330 --> 04:21.197
and that intense gentleman
over there is Ronald.

04:21.250 --> 04:22.990
I'm financing their company.

04:23.040 --> 04:24.826
--Congratulations.
That's amazing.

04:24.830 --> 04:26.695
- Thank you.
- Yeah, that's great.

04:26.790 --> 04:29.327
-He's a good egg.
-Mm. Sounds like
we should be celebrating, huh?

04:29.330 --> 04:31.321
- What does
it look like we're doing?
I mean out there.

04:31.370 --> 04:33.827
On the dance floor.
-I don't dance.
You know that.

04:33.910 --> 04:35.650
- Oh, whatever.
- You always say that.

04:35.750 --> 04:38.492
-And it's always true.

04:38.580 --> 04:40.116
-You look like you dance.

04:40.160 --> 04:41.570
- I give off that vibe, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

04:41.620 --> 04:44.578
-If I like the music, I dance.

04:44.620 --> 04:47.999
If I don't like the music,
no dancing.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.406
-Do you like the music here?

04:51.450 --> 04:53.077
-Yeah. I love the music.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.497
- Good.
- Let's go dance.

04:55.540 --> 04:57.656
- Okay.
- We're gonna go dance.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.650
-I've gotta take a piss.

05:47.500 --> 05:49.491
Nico walked me
through your code.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.286
It made me wanna code again.

05:51.330 --> 05:53.821
- You don't code anymore?
- No.

05:53.870 --> 05:57.158
Uh, no time, really.
But I miss it.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.651
I miss being creative,
you know? Hands-on.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.652
-Well, it doesn't look like
you're doing too bad
without it, though.

06:02.750 --> 06:05.651
- It's all relative.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.691
Cheers.
-Mm.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.576
-You know, I'll admit it.
I've been trying to figure

06:13.620 --> 06:16.157
something like this out
for a long time.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.827
-Something like GenCoin?

06:17.870 --> 06:20.532
-Yeah.
I mean, there's so many
other ones out there.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.195
Ever since
BitCoin hit the scene

06:22.250 --> 06:24.070
and all those other open-source
peer-to-peers,

06:24.160 --> 06:25.991
all I could think was...

06:26.000 --> 06:28.787
if you made one
that was closed-source. ..
-Impervrous to corruption.

06:28.830 --> 06:31.651
-Yes!
To human nature altogether.
-Exactly.

06:31.700 --> 06:35.693
-No one could crack it.
No one's code was stable enough.

06:35.790 --> 06:37.326
_ -It took me _
five years to write.

06:37.410 --> 06:41.323
Well, seven,
if you count all the drafts
that imploded on me.

06:44.120 --> 06:46.782
-You're special, Izzy.

06:46.830 --> 06:48.900
Don't let anyone
ever tell you otherwise.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.651
-We need shots!
-GImme!

07:08.700 --> 07:10.941
- Tequila.
- Tequila, tequila.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.116
-Could I-- could I get
a water as well, please?

07:13.160 --> 07:14.821
-You need agave water.

07:14.830 --> 07:16.320
-How about some limes
for this drink?

07:22.160 --> 07:23.320
- Hey there.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.156
-Hey, hey. Oh, dude.
-He'll be right back.

07:26.160 --> 07:29.448
-Okay, I'll be right--
hey. Hey.

07:29.500 --> 07:31.900
What?
-Hey, just listen,

07:31.950 --> 07:33.247
Don't look right off.
-All right.

07:33.290 --> 07:35.440
-Some massive shit's

07:35.500 --> 07:37.491

-Vera at that booth right there

07:37.540 --> 07:39.405
with some Russians, been
getting all chummy all night.

07:39.450 --> 07:41.281
Now, don't make a thing.

07:41.330 --> 07:43.195
Bruh.
-What?

07:43.250 --> 07:45.491
-That's a thing.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.866
What you did
right there, that was a thing.
-All right. I know. I got it.

07:47.910 --> 07:50.071
-Don't make
a thing, just look.
-I got it. All right.

08:01.250 --> 08:04.117
Dude, I don't know.
She's talking to some guys
with big arms. Whatever.

08:04.160 --> 08:07.994
-They packing.
I can tell by the way
they sat back down, dawg.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.491
-I mean, you're--
aren't you packing?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.996
So, you think they're, like...
-They clipped up.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.576
And it ain't just
the heat, dawg.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.248
Lots of folks been comin'

Lots of business

-Ronald?

08:20.620 --> 08:22.656
I want you to listen to me.

08:22.700 --> 08:25.828
You have to have some_fun.
-Hey, dawg, all I'm sayIn'--

08:25.830 --> 08:28.321
-Come on!
Listen. This is it.

08:28.330 --> 08:30.901
We got GenCoin financed.
You did that.

08:31.000 --> 08:35.369
We're gonna change the world.
Can't you just enjoy that?

08:35.450 --> 08:36.997
Nicholas!

08:37.000 --> 08:39.491
- Let's go dance!
- Hey. Hey.

08:39.540 --> 08:40.996
-Yeah!

10:02.290 --> 10:03.279
-Hey.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.782
-Hi.
-What are you doing up?

10:09.410 --> 10:10.650
-Couldn't sleep.

10:13.330 --> 10:17.869
-Okay. Well, I gotta
work tomorrow, so...

10:17.910 --> 10:18.899
-Izzy.

10:20.040 --> 10:21.325
-What?

10:21.370 --> 10:22.780
-Are you okay?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.286
-Yeah.

10:24.330 --> 10:26.992
-'Cause... when you
didn't come home
last night--

10:27.040 --> 10:28.246
-Dad, I'm 25.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.822
-Mm-hmm.
But you owe money.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.819
-I took care of it.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.150
-You sure?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.657
-It's handled.
Everything is good.

10:45.200 --> 10:46.497
-You hungry at all?

10:48.000 --> 10:50.070
You're hungry.

10:50.120 --> 10:51.656
How 'bout I cook us
some breakfast?

10:51.660 --> 10:53.400
-Is it gonna cure
my hangover?

10:53.450 --> 10:55.998
- It's a good start.

11:01.040 --> 11:02.359
- Hey!

11:02.410 --> 11:03.536
-I'll buy you some more.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.447
-No. I mean, give me one.

11:18.410 --> 11:19.399
-Take that.

11:25.330 --> 11:29.778
-Mm. I'm not doing
anything fancy here, okay?

11:29.830 --> 11:31.400
-That's cool.

11:31.450 --> 11:33.998
-Your mother always intimidate
me when it comes to cooking.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.821
It's demoralizing.
-I don't even like
her scrambled eggs.

11:36.910 --> 11:38.150
Yours are better.

11:38.200 --> 11:40.282
-Rea|ly?
-Don't tell her.

11:40.330 --> 11:43.242
-Remember when we used to
do them With crnnamon sugar?

11:43.290 --> 11:45.281
-Yeah, that's why
I like them.

11:55.040 --> 11:58.749
-Pour it up. Wah-wah.

12:00.660 --> 12:01.649
Yes.

12:10.580 --> 12:12.571
You still got it, old man.

12:19.160 --> 12:20.149
Mm.

12:23.370 --> 12:24.655
-Mm.

12:30.330 --> 12:32.116
-Mm.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.367
-So, you're good?

12:34.410 --> 12:36.037
-I'm fine, Dad.

12:36.080 --> 12:38.992
I got a new backer,
and he's gonna take care
of all our debts.

12:40.830 --> 12:42.240
What?

12:45.290 --> 12:46.655
-No more, okay?

12:50.330 --> 12:53.572
Asking the wrong people
for money.

12:55.120 --> 12:57.611
Your mother and I--
-I know, Dad. I know.

12:57.660 --> 12:58.820
-Mija...

13:00.660 --> 13:01.866
it never leaves you.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.366
Even after you're square.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.742
-We're good.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.782
Everything's okay.
It's just business.

13:21.330 --> 13:23.400
Eat up. You need the protein
to deal with Mom

13:23.500 --> 13:25.195
on all this wedding bullshit.

13:25.250 --> 13:27.992
- I'm gonna quote you.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.651
- No, please, don't.

13:45.290 --> 13:48.942
-Yeah.
-It's Kossaras.
Check your e-mail.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.571
Sent you some surveillance.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.326
We've been looking
into your guys,

13:53.370 --> 13:56.442
and it seems like
they've been getting cozy
with Alex Bell.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.786
Have you been investigating
him for anything?

13:58.830 --> 13:59.865
-No.

13:59.910 --> 14:01.992
-Any connections
you can think of?

14:02.000 --> 14:06.039
Anything there
Maddie might have found
that she wasn't supposed to?

14:34.790 --> 14:37.998
Oh.

15:38.370 --> 15:40.156
- Hey.
- Hello.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.239
-Hi.

15:47.290 --> 15:48.996
That was a fun night.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.577
-That was fun.
That was a lot of fun.

15:51.620 --> 15:53.690
Um, how did we get here?

15:55.120 --> 15:56.826
-Kristina drove us.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.530
- Kristina?

15:59.580 --> 16:02.196
--And she's, um...

16:02.250 --> 16:04.195
-I think she's on the couch.

16:05.580 --> 16:06.535
- I see.

16:16.370 --> 16:18.611
- Morning.
- Hey there.

16:23.830 --> 16:26.651
- Sounded like
a good time last night.

16:27.910 --> 16:29.070
-Hey, who's Taylor?

16:29.120 --> 16:30.690
-Hm?

16:30.750 --> 16:32.945
-You kept calling me Taylor,
in the car.

16:33.000 --> 16:36.117
I thought it was funny,
so I just went along with it.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.530
-Uh, wow.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.899
-My girl up yet?

16:39.950 --> 16:42.828
-Uh, yeah.
She's up. She's up.

16:42.870 --> 16:45.111
She's comin'.

16:45.160 --> 16:47.822
-Hey, bitch.
-What up, slut?

16:47.870 --> 16:49.997
-Rea|ly? Look who's talking.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.996
After last night.

16:53.040 --> 16:56.498
-Hey, you guys
wanna go get waffles?
-Mmm, waffles!

16:56.540 --> 16:57.996
I knew you'd be down.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.491
Better yet, I've got
this friend Steve...
-Um...

17:00.540 --> 17:02.610
-...and he's got a yacht,
and we can invite
whoever we want.

17:02.660 --> 17:05.493
- You're not doing that right now.
- Are you kidding me?

17:05.500 --> 17:07.900
You're amazing.
-I need a pick-me-up.

17:07.950 --> 17:09.497
-Do you think Kathleen
will want to come?

17:09.580 --> 17:11.946
I think Kathleen
will so want to go.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.037
-You would love Kathleen.
-For sure.

17:15.080 --> 17:18.538
You wanna go?
-Mm-mmm. I can't, unfortunately.
I gotta go to work.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.866
-No, you work for Alex now,
right?

17:20.910 --> 17:22.650
-I do work with Alex, yeah.

17:22.700 --> 17:24.782
-He doesn't get in
till like 11:00.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.195
- Really?
- Vodka.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.992
--None of those guys do.

17:30.500 --> 17:32.320
- I'd so be down for that.
- Right?

17:34.040 --> 17:36.691
-Thanks, Nick.
-My pleasure.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.496
- God, it's so bright.

17:38.500 --> 17:42.368
-Hey, hey.
-Thank you.

17:46.330 --> 17:48.286
This was really fun.
-Yeah.

17:48.330 --> 17:49.786
-We should
do it again sometime.
-Absolutely.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.616
- Bye!

17:51.660 --> 17:53.446
-I think I'm still
too drunk to drive.

17:53.500 --> 17:55.400
Bitch,
you drove us home last night.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.077
- Did I really?
- Yes.

17:57.120 --> 17:58.326
Oh, my god.

18:01.450 --> 18:03.281
Bye, party pooper!

19:15.790 --> 19:16.825
-Hi, Nick.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.440
May I come in?

19:22.830 --> 19:25.196
-Can I say no?
-Your dad didn't give you

19:25.250 --> 19:27.650
the crash course
before he left, huh?

19:27.700 --> 19:30.578
Uh, without a warrant,
I have to be invited
Into your home.

19:32.040 --> 19:33.996
- Like a vampire.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.537
Yeah. just like that.
Just like that.

19:36.580 --> 19:38.992
Except vampires
don't get warrants. I do.

19:40.250 --> 19:41.535
-So, do you have one?
-No, I don't.

19:41.620 --> 19:43.440
I can get one, though
Would you like me to?

19:47.160 --> 19:50.948
-No, it's okay.
-Thank you. That's sweet.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.992
Oh. Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.444
Having fun, right?

19:57.160 --> 19:59.116
Building your little project,

19:59.160 --> 20:01.321
getting into bed
with the big money?

20:01.370 --> 20:03.577
-It's a startup.
It's a legitimate business.

20:04.750 --> 20:05.899
-Uh-huh.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.940
-Hey, I know you're looking for
my dad, but what I'm doing-—

20:10.000 --> 20:11.945
-But what?
It's-it's-- it's what?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.820
-Hm?
-What you're doing is what?

20:13.870 --> 20:16.156
Tell me what you're doing.
-What I'm doing is completely
by the book

20:16.200 --> 20:17.827
and doesn't have anything
to do with my father.

20:17.870 --> 20:20.657
-Good. That's-- that's good.

20:20.660 --> 20:23.322
Please, come on.
Tell me more.

20:23.330 --> 20:27.152
Tell me how
your first lot of money
wasn't actually

20:27.160 --> 20:28.991
illegal drug cash.

20:29.040 --> 20:30.530
Actually, no,
don't tell me that.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.656
Just stand there
and think about

20:32.660 --> 20:36.653
what your first day
in federal prison
will be like.

20:36.750 --> 20:38.820
--Hm?

20:38.830 --> 20:40.900
Who you'll make friends with,
how showering would feel.

20:40.950 --> 20:42.577
Salut.

20:43.620 --> 20:44.655
Mm.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.748
-Are you gonna arrest me?
-That depends.

20:46.790 --> 20:48.576
-Yeah, on what?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.656
--Alex Bell.

20:53.830 --> 20:55.115
You're doing business with him?

20:55.160 --> 20:57.822
-Trying.
-Trying, that's good. Good.

20:57.830 --> 20:59.149
-'Cause I need information.

20:59.160 --> 21:00.536
-Do you? On Alex?

21:00.580 --> 21:03.196
-FinCEN's building a case.
-Oh.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.787
Yeah, I don't know what
to tell you. I mean, he seems
like a good guy to me.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.366
-I'm sure he is,
but this is Miami.

21:07.450 --> 21:09.361
Even the good get dirty.
Ask your daddy.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.116
I need bills and bank records.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.321
I need the chain of title
for all his illegal shells.

21:15.410 --> 21:17.992
He's got code monkeys
keeping it all locked tight.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.570
-What makes you think
I can get it?

21:19.620 --> 21:20.939
-Nothing makes me think
you could get it,

21:21.000 --> 21:22.536
but Isabelle Morales could.

21:24.910 --> 21:27.117
I need full cooperation
from all three of you.

21:27.160 --> 21:28.787
So, understand that.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.536
If you can't
help me with this...

21:31.950 --> 21:32.939
well...

21:34.410 --> 21:36.116
-Well, what?

21:38.540 --> 21:41.247
I'm sorry, are you gonna
arrest me, or not?

21:41.330 --> 21:43.696
I think you should.
Go for it.

21:43.750 --> 21:46.787
You know what I've done.
You know whose money
I've taken, apparently.

21:46.830 --> 21:49.321
Haul me in, right now.

21:49.330 --> 21:51.446
Let's make this very,
very public.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.446
Unless, of course,
that would get in the way

21:55.500 --> 21:58.572
of you blackmailing Alex
the same way you blackmailed
my dad.

22:03.500 --> 22:06.037
So, you can go.
I'd like you to leave.

22:07.620 --> 22:11.033
-What?
-I would like you to leave.

22:11.080 --> 22:12.741
The magic words.

22:16.750 --> 22:18.615
Go get the warrant!

22:31.660 --> 22:33.821
Get the fuck out of here.

23:21.160 --> 23:22.991
- Hello?
- Special Agent Rask?

23:23.080 --> 23:25.150
-Yeah.
-This is Special Agent Guerra.

23:25.250 --> 23:28.287
They found a body.
We're waiting on dental,

23:28.330 --> 23:30.150
but we suspect
it's Agent Pierce.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.196
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

23:33.250 --> 23:34.490
Are you at your office?

24:07.160 --> 24:09.651
-Dammit.
Fuck!Fuck!

24:22.000 --> 24:23.490
Shit.

24:26.250 --> 24:28.070
God dammit.

24:41.160 --> 24:43.492
--Excuse me. Hi.

24:43.580 --> 24:45.445
Uh, I hate being
this guy to ask,

24:45.500 --> 24:48.287
but I-- you wouldn't
be able to spare a few bucks
for some gas, would you?

24:48.330 --> 24:49.445
-No, sorry.
-I hate to-- Listen.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.695
-I don't have any cash.
-No, neither do I.

24:51.750 --> 24:53.786
I hate to ask, but, um...

24:53.830 --> 24:55.195
if you put it
on your credit card,

24:55.250 --> 24:57.491
I will pay you that
right back, with interest.

24:57.540 --> 25:00.077
-No, I'm sorry. Nah.
-We can swap details.

25:00.120 --> 25:03.112
And, uh, listen.
I'm a trustworthy guy.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.242
You know,
I'm an FBI agent, right?

25:05.290 --> 25:07.030
So, you know
you're gonna get it back.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.868
Um, I hate to ask.
-No. Sorry. I don't have any.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.070
-Not even on your...
-Yeah.

25:12.160 --> 25:14.401
-...card? No?
-No. No, sorry.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.650
-All right, man.

25:56.160 --> 25:57.616
-Hey.

26:08.580 --> 26:10.150
Thank you.
-Mm-hmm.

26:14.370 --> 26:16.747
Look, I'm sorry.
I know it's late,

26:16.790 --> 26:19.406
uh, but I need
to ask a favor.

26:24.700 --> 26:26.782
I need to borrow some money.

26:29.080 --> 26:30.570
-What for?

26:30.660 --> 26:32.491
-I can pay you back,
I just didn't know
where else to go.

26:32.500 --> 26:35.151
-Like, do you need hundreds
or thousands, or how much
do you need?

26:35.200 --> 26:37.031
-As much as you can give me.

26:40.620 --> 26:43.327
-Okay, I'll--
I'll write you a check.

26:43.330 --> 26:47.778
-Mm-mmm. Mm-mmm. No,
I need it now, like tonight.

26:49.290 --> 26:50.905
-What is going on?

26:50.950 --> 26:53.111
-Mm. Nothing.
I'm just short on money,
like I said.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.149
-Mm.

26:55.290 --> 26:58.691
- And I, uh...

27:01.250 --> 27:03.400
Mm. Christ.

27:05.450 --> 27:10.444
-Hey. Phil, you're kinda
freaking me out here...
with your...

27:11.500 --> 27:13.821
- I know.

27:13.830 --> 27:17.493
-Yeah, okay, so...
just talk to me.

27:17.540 --> 27:19.861
Just... talk to me.

27:19.950 --> 27:23.499
-I killed my partner. Okay?

27:35.910 --> 27:37.320
I was on the take.

27:42.160 --> 27:45.448
Every one I know is on the take,
so I wanted in.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.695
Just once_.
Just gonna do It once,
then quit.

27:49.120 --> 27:52.612
But she found out and...

27:52.660 --> 27:54.366
she was being clever,
she was a real go-getter,

27:54.410 --> 27:57.038
and she put me in a bad spot,
a real bad spot.

27:57.080 --> 27:59.651
And once I know that,
there's nothing I can do.
She's gotta go.

27:59.660 --> 28:00.649
So...

28:08.040 --> 28:09.826
Look, I bashed her head in.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.742
I mean... wham.

28:16.950 --> 28:18.076
Split her skull.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.783
Blood. Blood just
everywhere on the floor.

28:28.830 --> 28:32.038
And, uh...

28:35.080 --> 28:38.322
And I'm really in it.
'Cause where do you go
from there?

28:38.370 --> 28:40.907
Shall I tell you
where I went from there?

28:42.750 --> 28:44.820
I got a suitcase out.

28:44.830 --> 28:48.038
I folded her up,
and I stuffed her inside.

28:49.160 --> 28:51.446
And then I drove her
to the river,

28:51.500 --> 28:54.242
thinking the gators
have got to get to her
before anyone finds out.

28:54.290 --> 28:56.656
Only people did find out,
even though the gators
got to her,

28:56.660 --> 28:59.618
kinda, sorta.

28:59.660 --> 29:02.151
But there were arms and legs,
I guess.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.827
Hair, teeth--
I'm not sure.

29:03.870 --> 29:05.531
Oh, I've gotta get away.

29:05.580 --> 29:07.650
But that little Ho Chi Minh
fuckface hacker,

29:07.700 --> 29:09.327
he stole all my money
like a little pussy.

29:09.370 --> 29:12.191
So, now what?
God only-- Fuck.

29:12.250 --> 29:13.786
Fuck.
Her name was Maddie.

29:18.500 --> 29:20.536
This your purse?

29:20.580 --> 29:22.821
- I'll pay you back.
- I promise.

29:43.450 --> 29:45.361
- Let's go.

31:34.330 --> 31:36.867
Who the fuck are you?

31:36.950 --> 31:38.577
Who the fuck are you?

32:36.620 --> 32:38.110
Huh.

32:56.540 --> 32:58.155
Yeah.

33:22.750 --> 33:23.785
-Hey, Tam.

33:23.830 --> 33:25.195
-Ron, where are you at?

33:25.250 --> 33:27.491
-I'm on my way home.
What's wrong?

33:27.500 --> 33:29.570
-Some of Oskar's boys came
by the house.

33:29.660 --> 33:32.242
They started
lookin' at me all nasty
and lookin' at Els, too.

33:32.330 --> 33:34.150
They comin' for us,
Ronnie.

33:34.200 --> 33:35.827
They comin' for all of us.

33:35.870 --> 33:37.326
-Okay, baby.
Where you at right now?

33:37.330 --> 33:38.445
-I'm in that corner store.

33:38.500 --> 33:40.036
I just took Els,
I started walking.

33:40.120 --> 33:42.190
I just wanted
to be someplace public.

33:42.290 --> 33:43.496
-All right.
Where Touie at?

33:43.500 --> 33:45.650
- I don't know.

33:45.660 --> 33:47.821
I been callin' him all day.
I can't find him.

33:47.910 --> 33:49.320
-Okay, baby.
Stay at that store.

33:49.410 --> 33:50.900
I'm gonna come get you.
We're gonna go home.

33:50.950 --> 33:52.656
We gonna find Touie,
and we gonna leave, a'ight?

33:52.700 --> 33:55.248
- Yeah.
Yeah.

33:55.290 --> 33:57.406
Just hurry.

33:57.450 --> 33:58.747
-Okay.

34:11.410 --> 34:13.651
-Somebody smack that ass,
you out here.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.282
-He ain't answerin'.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.326
He'll be fine.
How we gonna find him?

34:49.370 --> 34:52.828
-Mom, what's going on?

34:52.870 --> 34:54.997
We're just tryin' to find
your brother, okay?

35:24.000 --> 35:26.446
-What are you doin', man?
-How do you do?

35:26.500 --> 35:28.991
-Celebrate, smoker.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.827
-I know you seen what went down
with your daddy the other day.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.151
You ain't like that,
though, right?

35:34.160 --> 35:35.696
That's what you told me, right?

35:37.000 --> 35:39.742
Right?
-Right.

35:39.830 --> 35:42.116
-Your daddy,
he's strong, man.

35:42.160 --> 35:44.947
He's strong.
_He's been like that
smce we was chllluns.

35:45.000 --> 35:46.490
Hard not to respect that.

35:48.500 --> 35:50.650
But, hey,
the way he going?
