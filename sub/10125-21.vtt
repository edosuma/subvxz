YOU KNOW, KRISTEN,
I DON'T MIND PAYING CHUBBY
THAT $3.00 COVER CHARGE,

00:17.000 --> 00:20.200
IF IT MEANS
I CAN DO THIS.

00:23.400 --> 00:26.100
HA HA HA.

00:26.100 --> 00:28.934
CORY, I'M SO FLATTERED

00:28.934 --> 00:30.667
YOU FOUND THE TIME
TO GO OUT WITH ME.

00:30.667 --> 00:33.033
THE WHOLE SCHOOL KNOWS
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN SINGLE

00:33.033 --> 00:35.400
YOU'VE BEEN OUT
WITH A DIFFERENT GIRL
EVERY NIGHT.

00:35.400 --> 00:37.133
I HAD TO GET THEM
OUT OF THE WAY

00:37.133 --> 00:38.100
TO MAKE TIME
FOR A FETCHING GAL
LIKE YOU.

00:38.100 --> 00:40.400
HOW DO I KNOW
THAT'S NOT
JUST ANOTHER LINE

00:40.400 --> 00:42.033
FROM THE NEW
CORY MATTHEWS?

00:42.033 --> 00:45.133
LINES?
I HAVE NO LINES...

00:45.133 --> 00:50.200
BECAUSE YOUR
PRETTY BLUE EYES
LEAVE ME SPEECHLESS.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.734
SO, WHAT ELSE
IS THE SCHOOL
SAYING ABOUT ME?

00:52.734 --> 00:54.834
THEY SAY JUST BEFORE
YOU KISS A GIRL,

00:54.834 --> 00:57.467
YOU PASS A FRY
FROM KNUCKLE TO KNUCKLE.

01:00.200 --> 01:01.667
HUH.

01:01.667 --> 01:02.900
THAT'S
INTERESTING.

01:07.800 --> 01:09.734
THAT WAS NICE, CORY.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.667
IT SURE WAS,
TOPANGA.

01:11.667 --> 01:14.200
YOU JUST CALLED ME
TOPANGA.

01:16.133 --> 01:17.400
OH, BOY.

01:17.400 --> 01:19.200
YOU CALLED HER
TOPANGA?

01:19.200 --> 01:21.934
NOW, SHAWN,
IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

01:21.934 --> 01:23.367
YOU'RE REALLY BAD
WITH NAMES.

01:23.367 --> 01:24.400
DO WHAT I DO.

01:24.400 --> 01:25.700
WRITE THEM
ON YOUR HAND...

01:25.700 --> 01:26.700
CORY.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.200
NO, THE PROBLEM IS,

01:29.200 --> 01:30.767
NO MATTER HOW MANY GIRLS
I GO OUT WITH,

01:30.767 --> 01:33.033
I STILL END UP
THINKING ABOUT TOPANGA.

01:33.033 --> 01:34.834
THEN WHY'D YOU
BREAK UP WITH HER?

01:34.834 --> 01:36.100
I MADE A MISTAKE.

01:36.100 --> 01:39.600
I THOUGHT
WE COULD BE FRIENDS,
LIKE YOU AND I ARE,

01:39.600 --> 01:40.800
BUT WHEN I SEE TOPANGA,

01:40.800 --> 01:43.734
I WANT TO HUG HER,
HOLD HER, KISS HER.

01:43.734 --> 01:45.133
WHEN I SEE YOU,

01:45.133 --> 01:47.100
I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN ANY OF THOSE THINGS.

01:47.100 --> 01:50.033
SO HOW DO YOU THINK
SHE FEELS ABOUT YOU?

01:50.033 --> 01:51.867
I WILL ASK.

01:51.867 --> 01:52.867
HEY, TOPANGA.

01:52.867 --> 01:54.200
HI, CORY.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.934
SHE WANTS BACK.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.200
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,

01:57.200 --> 01:59.367
REMEMBER THE PAPERS
FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL
ESSAY AWARDS

01:59.367 --> 02:00.600

02:00.600 --> 02:01.934
OH, YEAH.

STUDENTS--

02:13.500 --> 02:14.667
KRISTEN HOFFMAN.

02:16.834 --> 02:18.934
THAT'S GOOD FOR HER.
A WEEK IN FLORIDA,

02:18.934 --> 02:20.967
A LITTLE SUN,
A LITTLE COLOR,
A LITTLE OCEAN AIR,

02:20.967 --> 02:22.200
COULD HELP HER
GET OVER ME.

02:22.200 --> 02:23.834
RONNIE WATERMAN.

02:25.667 --> 02:27.967
SHE'LL GET OVER YOU
QUICKLY ENOUGH

02:27.967 --> 02:30.467
WITH "LIPS" WATERMAN
ON THE SAME TRIP.

02:30.467 --> 02:33.900
PERFECT. KRISTEN
WITH "LIPS" IN FLORIDA,

02:33.900 --> 02:37.700

YOU KNOW, SHAWN,
SOMETIMES EVERYTHING
IN MY LIFE

02:39.900 --> 02:41.800
JUST SEEMS
TO GO MY WAY.

02:41.800 --> 02:43.133
AND OUR LAST WINNER IS...

02:43.133 --> 02:44.600
TOPANGA LAWRENCE.

02:48.600 --> 02:50.800
I HATE
MY STINKING LIFE!

02:53.934 --> 02:55.834
RONNIE, DO YOU THINK
THIS RIDE IS SAFE?

02:55.834 --> 02:58.200
WHAT IF MY HAIR
GETS CAUGHT
IN THE ROTOR?

02:58.200 --> 03:01.100
YOUR HAIR IS SAFE,

03:01.100 --> 03:03.100
BUT YOUR LIPS,

03:03.100 --> 03:05.100
THEY'RE IN DANGER.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.400
AHHH!

03:06.400 --> 03:07.000
AHHH!

03:07.000 --> 03:08.834
NO LIPS! NO LIPS!

03:08.834 --> 03:12.100
CORY, WERE YOU HAVING
THAT NIGHTMARE AGAIN

03:12.100 --> 03:13.967
WHERE YOU'RE KIDNAPPED
BY FIGURE SKATERS

03:13.967 --> 03:16.600
AND FORCED
TO DO COMPULSORIES
AGAINST YOUR WILL?

03:16.600 --> 03:20.000
NO, I ONLY
HAVE THAT DREAM
EVERY FOUR YEARS.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.934
ERIC, LOOK.

03:20.934 --> 03:22.233
I'M IN A BAD WAY.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.867
I NEED YOUR ADVICE.

03:23.867 --> 03:26.000
YOU LOVE TOPANGA
AND WANT HER BACK.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.934
THAT'S BRILLIANT,

03:27.934 --> 03:30.233
SO VERY INSIGHTFUL.
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

03:36.000 --> 03:37.600
OH.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.200
LOOK, ERIC, EVER SINCE
I BROKE UP WITH TOPANGA,

03:40.200 --> 03:44.200
I--I'VE GOT THIS GNAWING
IN THE PIT OF MY STOMACH

03:44.200 --> 03:45.834
THAT JUST WON'T GO AWAY.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.834
YOUR POOR LITTLE BODY
GOES THROUGH SO MUCH.

03:47.834 --> 03:49.867
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER
HOW YOU FEEL,

03:49.867 --> 03:51.700
AND LET ME
GO BACK TO BED.

03:51.700 --> 03:53.800
I CAN'T. SHE'S GOING
OUT OF TOWN.

03:53.800 --> 03:56.300
SHE WON SOME TRIP
TO WALT DISNEY WORLD.

03:56.300 --> 03:58.400
THEN, CORY,
I'VE GOT TO SAY

03:58.400 --> 04:01.200
GO TO FLORIDA
IMMEDIATELY.

04:01.200 --> 04:02.233
WIN BACK YOUR WOMAN.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.934
JUST LIKE THAT?
GO TO FLORIDA?

04:03.934 --> 04:05.367
THAT'S INSANE.
WHAT ABOUT SUNSCREEN?

04:05.367 --> 04:06.700
I HAVE SPOKEN.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.133
ERIC, I'M TAKING
YOUR ADVICE.

04:12.133 --> 04:15.600
I'M GOING TO FLORIDA
TO GET BACK
THE WOMAN I LOVE.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.600
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
COR.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.967
YOU THINK YOU CAN
COVER FOR ME?

04:17.967 --> 04:19.133
I AM WAY AHEAD OF YOU.

04:19.133 --> 04:20.000
WHY?
WHAT'S IN THE BAG?

04:21.100 --> 04:22.467
YOU.

04:24.000 --> 04:27.934
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
INTO A MIRROR, HUH?

04:27.934 --> 04:30.834
ERIC, YOU'D HAVE TO BE
THE BIGGEST IDIOT
ON THE PLANET

04:30.834 --> 04:31.834
TO THINK THAT'S ME.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.600
HEY, ERIC.
HEY, COR.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.600
AHH!

04:37.600 --> 04:40.700
BOY, YOU REALLY
WENT TO A LOT
OF TROUBLE FOR ME.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.100
WELL, I FIGURED
YOU'RE MY ONLY BROTHER,

04:42.100 --> 04:45.700
AND IT'S NOT
GOING TO KILL ME
TO SHOW A LITTLE...

04:45.700 --> 04:46.734
UM, AFFECTION.

04:48.667 --> 04:49.900
ALL RIGHT,
ALL I'VE GOT TO DO

04:49.900 --> 04:51.934
IS SPEND
ALL THE MONEY I HAVE

04:51.934 --> 04:53.100
ON A PLANE TICKET.

04:53.100 --> 04:55.467
OH, I GOT TICKETS
FROM MY UNCLE NICKY.

04:55.467 --> 04:59.400
YOUR UNCLE WHO'S IN
THE "GAMING INDUSTRY"?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.233
YEAH, AND THERE'S
A SLIGHT CHANCE

05:01.233 --> 05:03.500
WE'LL HAVE TO
BREAK SOMEONE'S KNEES
WHILE WE'RE THERE.

05:03.500 --> 05:05.600
WAIT, WE?
YOU'RE COMING TOO?

05:05.600 --> 05:07.900
FOR ALL THE TIMES
YOU'VE BEEN THERE
FOR ME,

05:07.900 --> 05:08.967
I OWE YOU ONE.

05:08.967 --> 05:11.000
THANKS, MAN.

05:14.500 --> 05:17.300
MAYBE IF I TELL TOPANGA
HOW I FEEL
BEFORE SHE LEAVES,

05:17.300 --> 05:18.900
WE WON'T HAVE TO DO
THIS WHOLE THING.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.900
UH, TOPANGA?

05:22.900 --> 05:24.467
CORY, HI.
ISN'T THIS EXCITING?

05:24.467 --> 05:27.100
I'M ON MY WAY
TO FLORIDA.

05:27.100 --> 05:30.033
YEAH, UM, LOOK,
I'LL GET RIGHT TO IT.

05:30.033 --> 05:32.767
YOU AND ME,
WE'VE BEEN APART
FOR THREE MONTHS NOW,

05:32.767 --> 05:34.500
AND I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU,

05:34.500 --> 05:38.200
BUT I'VE STILL GOT
ALL THESE FEELINGS
FOR YOU.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.867
I HAVE FEELINGS
FOR YOU, TOO, CORY.

05:39.867 --> 05:42.567
THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALWAYS
GOING TO BE FRIENDS,
RIGHT?

05:42.567 --> 05:44.000
YEAH, BUT COME ON.

05:44.000 --> 05:46.967
TELL ME YOU HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT US
GETTING BACK TOGETHER.

05:46.967 --> 05:49.133
WELL, YEAH, I'VE
THOUGHT ABOUT IT,

05:49.133 --> 05:50.700
BUT IT'S REALLY HARD
TO TRUST YOU

05:50.700 --> 05:53.000
WHEN THIS NEW
CORY MATTHEWS
IS RUNNING AROUND

05:53.000 --> 05:54.233
DATING ALL THOSE
OTHER GIRLS.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.567
I WENT OUT
WITH THOSE OTHER GIRLS

05:56.567 --> 05:57.900
BECAUSE I HATED
BEING ALONE,

05:57.900 --> 05:59.734
BUT EVEN WITH THEM,
I WAS STILL ALONE,

05:59.734 --> 06:00.934
BECAUSE I WASN'T
WITH YOU.

06:02.233 --> 06:04.567
CORY,
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.867
HEY, TOPANGA,
IS THIS YOURS?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.900
YEAH. IT'S MY CARRY-ON
OF HAIR PRODUCTS.

06:10.467 --> 06:12.700
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.200
CORY, I THOUGHT ABOUT
THE OTHER NIGHT.

06:15.200 --> 06:16.700
I WAS SILLY TO RUN AWAY.

06:16.700 --> 06:18.500
NO, RUNNING AWAY
WAS GOOD.

06:18.500 --> 06:20.100
YOU SHOULD'VE RUN
FURTHER.

06:20.100 --> 06:21.400
YOU'RE SUCH A GENTLEMAN.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.300
THAT'S WHY
WHEN I GET BACK
FROM FLORIDA

06:23.300 --> 06:25.700
I WANT
TO MAKE THINGS WORK
BETWEEN US.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.834
"I WAS STILL ALONE
BECAUSE I WASN'T WITH YOU."

06:33.500 --> 06:35.000
HA HA.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.300
YOU KNOW, TOPANGA,
APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT
SEEING THE HUMOR HERE,

06:37.300 --> 06:38.767
WHICH IS SURPRISING.

06:38.767 --> 06:42.200
LAUGH. GO AHEAD.
LAUGH WITH ME.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.600
CORY, YOU KNOW
WHAT I SEE?

06:43.600 --> 06:45.667
YOU, IN A ROBE,
WEARING SLIPPERS,
SMOKING A PIPE.

06:45.667 --> 06:47.133
WHA?

06:47.133 --> 06:49.367
CORY MATTHEWS, YOU'RE A--
A PLAYBOY.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.200
WINDOW OR AISLE SEAT?

07:18.100 --> 07:19.467
HI, EVERYONE.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.100
HI, I'M ALEXANDRA MORRIS.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.300
I'D LIKE TO WELCOME YOU
TO THE LIVING SEAS
PAVILION.

07:26.300 --> 07:28.100
FOR THE NEXT WEEK,

07:28.100 --> 07:29.800
WE'RE GOING TO BE STUDYING
AND OBSERVING DOLPHINS.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.500
RIGHT OUT HERE.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.967
OH, MY GOSH.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.033
COME ON. I'LL SHOW YOU
WHERE THEY PLAY.

07:42.233 --> 07:44.367
HUH?
DIDN'T I TELL YOU

07:44.367 --> 07:46.300
MY UNCLE NICKY
WOULD TAKE CARE OF OUR
TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS?

07:46.300 --> 07:48.467
WE TOOK
A CARGO PLANE,
SHAWN.

07:48.467 --> 07:51.100
I SAT NEXT TO
A CRATE
OF LIVE CHICKENS.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.200
YOU SEE THIS?
PECK MARKS.

07:53.200 --> 07:56.000
OH, COME ON, COR.
WE'RE HERE.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.400
THE HAPPIEST PLACE
ON EARTH.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.767
YEAH? THEN WHY AM I
SO MISERABLE?

07:59.767 --> 08:01.300
YOU'VE GOT TO DO
WHAT YOU CAME HERE TO DO.

08:01.300 --> 08:04.000
FIND TOPANGA, AND TELL HER
YOU STILL LOVE HER.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.400
I KNOW. SHE'S
THE MOST WONDERFUL THING

08:06.400 --> 08:08.000
THAT EVER HAPPENED
TO ME.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.000
HOW CAN I NOT HAVE HER
IN MY LIFE?

08:10.000 --> 08:14.300
SHAWN, THERE'S TENS
OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE.

08:14.300 --> 08:17.500
WE'VE GOT
THIS MUCH CHANCE
OF FINDING HER.

08:22.834 --> 08:23.834
[SIGHS]

08:23.834 --> 08:25.700
WELL, WE'D BETTER
GET STARTED.

08:25.700 --> 08:27.467
IT COULD TAKE DAYS.

08:39.033 --> 08:42.734
[TEACHER]
EXCELLENT ORAL REPORT,
CORY MATTHEWS.

08:44.300 --> 08:45.367
THANK YOU.

08:47.133 --> 08:50.100
O.K., WE'VE GOT
A 5-MINUTE BREAK,
COR,

08:50.100 --> 08:51.600
AND THEN WE'VE GOT GYM.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.200
SO COME ON--HERE WE--
DON'T STRUGGLE.
GET IN THERE.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.967
THERE WE GO.

08:55.967 --> 08:57.467
ALL RIGHT.

09:00.066 --> 09:00.867
MR. MATTHEWS,

09:00.867 --> 09:02.600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:02.600 --> 09:04.500
JUST PUTTING
MY BOOKS AWAY.

09:04.500 --> 09:06.133
I THOUGHT I SAW YOU

09:06.133 --> 09:09.100
STUFF YOUR BROTHER
INTO YOUR LOCKER.

09:09.100 --> 09:11.300
WHY WOULD I DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

09:11.300 --> 09:13.000
I DON'T KNOW,

09:13.000 --> 09:17.000
BUT I CLEARLY SAW
A CURLY-HAIRED BOY
ENTER YOUR LOCKER.

09:17.000 --> 09:19.667
WHY WOULD I WANT
A CURLY-HAIRED BOY
IN MY LOCKER?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.900
AGAIN, I DON'T KNOW.

09:22.900 --> 09:24.567
NOW, GET HIM
OUT OF THERE.

09:24.567 --> 09:27.200
GEORGE, CAN I
GRAB A WORD WITH YOU
A SECOND?

09:27.200 --> 09:28.767
MR. TURNER,
I'M BUSY RIGHT NOW.

09:28.767 --> 09:30.400
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN A MOMENT.

09:33.734 --> 09:34.767
THERE'S NO CORY
IN HERE.

09:34.767 --> 09:36.133
HA HA HA.

09:36.133 --> 09:38.300
DO YOU THINK
I'M A DUMMY,
MR. MATTHEWS?

09:38.300 --> 09:41.100
NO. NOT YOU.

09:41.100 --> 09:43.767
I'LL SEE YOU
IN DETENTION.

09:43.767 --> 09:44.867
[SIGHS]

09:48.600 --> 09:49.767
SHAWN, WE'VE BEEN
STANDING IN THIS LINE

09:49.767 --> 09:51.500
FOR OVER HALF AN HOUR.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.667
TOPANGA HAD BETTER
BE ON THIS RIDE.

09:52.667 --> 09:55.100
WHO SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A RIDE?

09:55.100 --> 09:56.200
CHURRO?

09:56.200 --> 09:58.734
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
COME ON. LET'S GO.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.233
WE TALK ABOUT
COMMUNICATING
WITH DOLPHINS.

10:03.233 --> 10:06.467
THE TRUTH IS, WE DON'T
SPEAK THEIR LANGUAGE,

10:06.467 --> 10:08.967
BUT WE CERTAINLY
UNDERSTAND THEIR EMOTIONS.

10:10.500 --> 10:13.367
THIS IS AMBER.
SHE WAS FOUND BEACHED.

10:13.367 --> 10:15.400
WE BROUGHT HER HERE
TO NURSE HER BACK TO HEALTH,

10:15.400 --> 10:17.300
BUT BECAUSE SHE'S BEEN
SEPARATED FROM HER FAMILY--

10:17.300 --> 10:19.400
QUITE POSSIBLY HER MATE--

10:19.400 --> 10:22.600
SHE SPENDS HER TIME ALONE,
AND MOST DISTRESSING,

10:22.600 --> 10:25.400
SHE'S LOST HER APPETITE
AND WON'T TAKE FOOD.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.800
WELL, WHAT'S
GOING TO HAPPEN?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.400
I DON'T KNOW,

10:29.400 --> 10:32.133
BUT I'M HOPING
SHE'S REUNITED
WITH HER MATE REAL SOON.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.033
SHAWN, I HAVE A FEELING
TOPANGA'S HERE.

10:38.033 --> 10:39.200
WHY?

10:39.200 --> 10:41.033
BECAUSE WE'VE LOOKED
EVERYWHERE ELSE.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.834
BRILLIANT.
THERE SHE IS.

10:45.834 --> 10:47.100
LOOK AT HER.

10:47.100 --> 10:50.033
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.233
I'M JUST GOING TO
GO OVER THERE

10:52.233 --> 10:53.800
AND TELL HER
THAT I LOVE HER,

10:53.800 --> 10:56.400
THAT I'VE LOVED HER
SINCE THE DAY
OUR EYES MET,

10:56.400 --> 10:59.133
AND THAT I WILL LOVE HER
UNTIL THE DAY I DIE,

10:59.133 --> 11:02.100
AND WHAT DO YOU
THINK SHE'LL SAY
WHEN SHE HEARS THAT?

11:02.100 --> 11:03.500
I LOVE YOU,
TOO, CORY.

11:03.500 --> 11:04.934
EXACTLY.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.233
KRISTEN.

11:08.233 --> 11:10.000
COMING ALL THE WAY
TO FLORIDA FOR ME?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.367
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

11:12.367 --> 11:14.500
NO. YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.867
OH, BUT I DO.

11:15.867 --> 11:17.834
OH, BOY.

11:34.967 --> 11:37.033
OOH. OW.

11:37.033 --> 11:40.000
MY BACK. EVERY DISC
OUT OF WHACK.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
MAJOR PAIN.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.467
WHEW.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.100
OH, BEST NIGHT'S
SLEEP I EVER HAD.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.667
YOU THINK
THEY SELL THESE
AT THE GIFT SHOP?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.967
A THOUSAND MILES
AWAY FROM HOME,

11:50.967 --> 11:53.300
I DIDN'T GET
THE GIRL I CAME FOR,

11:53.300 --> 11:56.100
AND I SLEPT IN A LOG.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.967
YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MAKES ME, SHAWN?

11:57.967 --> 12:00.200
A LOG-SLEEPIN' LOSER.

12:00.200 --> 12:02.000
I WAS JUST
FOOLING MYSELF,

12:02.000 --> 12:06.300
THINKING THERE'S
STILL A SPARK
BETWEEN ME AND TOPANGA.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.100
[SIGHS]

12:07.100 --> 12:10.000
COME ON.
LET'S GO HOME.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.033
O.K.

12:11.033 --> 12:12.200
SHAWN, MY HEART'S
BEEN SKEWERED,

12:12.200 --> 12:15.400
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
TALK ME INTO STAYING?

12:15.400 --> 12:17.700
WELL, WHY? YOU GAVE IT
YOUR BEST SHOT.

12:17.700 --> 12:20.567
CLEARLY,
SHE'S MORE INTERESTED
IN RONNIE WATERMAN.

12:20.567 --> 12:22.300
WAIT A SECOND.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.200
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO OFFER--

12:24.200 --> 12:25.200
PASSION,

12:25.200 --> 12:27.500
DEEP PASSION,
AND A HISTORY.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.500
SHAWN, I CAME HERE
TO WOO HER,

12:30.500 --> 12:31.967
AND, BY GUM,
WOO HER I WILL.

12:31.967 --> 12:33.567
SO WE'RE STAYING,
THEN?

12:33.567 --> 12:34.867
OF COURSE
WE'RE STAYING.

12:38.600 --> 12:41.867
OH, I SEE
WHAT YOU JUST DID--

12:41.867 --> 12:43.100
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.100
YOU LET ME THINK
I WAS A LOSER

12:45.100 --> 12:47.100
TO SHOW ME
I'M REALLY NOT A LOSER.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.300
NO, I JUST THINK
SHE AND RONNIE MAKE
A REALLY CUTE COUPLE.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.300
SHAWN.

12:51.300 --> 12:52.700
NOT AS CUTE
AS YOU AND TOPANGA.

12:52.700 --> 12:54.934
LOOK, ALL I KNOW IS
IT'S A NEW DAY,

12:54.934 --> 12:56.767
AND WHEN I SWEEP TOPI
OFF HER FEET,

12:56.767 --> 12:58.600
I WANT TO BE CLEAN
AND FRESH.

12:58.600 --> 13:02.233
CORY, WHERE ARE WE
GOING TO FIND A SHOWER?

13:02.233 --> 13:04.000
[SQUEAK]

13:04.000 --> 13:08.367
AHHH!
AHHH!

13:10.500 --> 13:14.033
NOW WHERE DO WE
FIND A TOWEL?

14:17.233 --> 14:18.300
TOPANGA...

14:18.300 --> 14:20.000
YOU HAVEN'T TOUCHED
YOUR FOOD.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.900
GUESS I'VE
JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

14:23.900 --> 14:25.967
ABOUT ME, HUH?

14:25.967 --> 14:27.400
NO. WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU?

14:27.400 --> 14:28.867
EVER SINCE
WE GOT HERE,

14:28.867 --> 14:29.700
YOU'VE BEEN TRYING
TO KISS ME.

14:29.700 --> 14:31.000
AND IF I LET YOU,

14:31.000 --> 14:34.100
YOU LEAVE BECAUSE
YOU GOT YOUR PRIZE.

14:34.100 --> 14:35.400
I'M NOT A PRIZE.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.834
THE MORE
GUYS CHASE ME,

14:36.834 --> 14:38.500
THE MORE
I GET TURNED OFF.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.400
HEY, TOPANGA,
IT'S ME.

14:40.400 --> 14:41.767
UGH!

14:44.734 --> 14:45.734
TOPANGA.

14:45.734 --> 14:47.900
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOUR FRIEND?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.767
HE'S JUST SHOWING
HOW MUCH HE LOVES YOU.

14:49.767 --> 14:51.300
THIS ONE WAS MY IDEA.

14:59.734 --> 15:01.300
TOPANGA.

15:01.300 --> 15:02.734
TOPANGA...

15:02.734 --> 15:05.300
MAYBE YOU DIDN'T
KNOW THAT WAS ME.

15:05.300 --> 15:09.033
I DID KNOW.
STOP CHASING ME,
ALL RIGHT?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.000
LOOK AT EVERYTHING
I'VE DONE FOR YOU.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.367
I FLEW HERE, DRESSED
IN HAREM PANTS
AND A FEZ--

15:14.367 --> 15:16.400
WHICH YOU KNOW
I DON'T PULL OFF--

15:16.400 --> 15:18.100
I SWAM
WITH THE FISHES--

15:18.100 --> 15:21.400
YOU COULD HIRE THE BLIMP
AND FLASH MY NAME IN NEON,

15:21.400 --> 15:23.734
AND IT WOULDN'T
MEAN A THING.

15:23.734 --> 15:25.400
OH, GOD.
PLEASE DON'T LOOK UP.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.600
I MEAN, THEY'RE ALL
JUST MEANINGLESS GESTURES.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.500
MEANINGLESS? THEY
COME FROM MY HEART.

15:31.500 --> 15:33.967
I WISH I COULD
BELIEVE YOU,

15:33.967 --> 15:36.467
BUT EVERY TIME
I TURN AROUND,

15:36.467 --> 15:37.734
YOU'RE WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

15:37.734 --> 15:41.133
OH, TOPANGA,
COME ON. EVERY TIME?

15:43.200 --> 15:44.367
KRISTEN, RIGHT?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.400
I WAS IN THE TANK
BEHIND YOU.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.500
YOU'RE
A FAST SWIMMER.

15:59.100 --> 16:02.700
LOOK, TOPANGA,
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING...

16:04.300 --> 16:06.600
OH. YOU'RE NOT TOPANGA.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.100
WHAT'S A TOPANGA?

16:08.100 --> 16:11.400
SORRY. IT WAS JUST SOMEONE
I WAS LOOKING FOR.

16:11.400 --> 16:14.900
I THOUGHT SHE'D BE HERE,
BUT I GUESS NOT.

16:14.900 --> 16:17.133
I'LL GET
OUT OF YOUR WAY

16:17.133 --> 16:18.867
AND LET YOU WORK.

16:18.867 --> 16:20.300
I DON'T WORK HERE.

16:20.300 --> 16:23.300
I WAS ON A TOUR
AND DECIDED TO GO
ON MY OWN,

16:23.300 --> 16:25.300
JUST ME
AND SOME DOLPHINS

16:25.300 --> 16:27.767
AND A BIG BUCKET
OF SMELT.

16:27.767 --> 16:30.100
WANT TO HELP ME
FEED THEM?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.200
YEAH, SURE.

16:36.734 --> 16:39.200
THIS ONE
DOESN'T SEEM HUNGRY.

16:39.200 --> 16:42.367
THE TRAINER WAS
TELLING ME ABOUT HER.
HER NAME'S AMBER.

16:42.367 --> 16:43.867
SHE'S SEPARATED
FROM HER MATE,

16:43.867 --> 16:46.500
AND SHE'S HAVING
A ROUGH TIME.

16:46.500 --> 16:48.767
SHE'S JUST AN ANIMAL.

16:50.700 --> 16:52.667
<i>JUST </i>AN ANIMAL?

16:52.667 --> 16:55.200
HOW DO YOU GET OFF
SAYING THAT?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.300
I'M SORRY. I--

16:56.300 --> 16:58.767
APOLOGIZE TO HER.

16:58.767 --> 17:00.100
I'M SERIOUS.

17:01.133 --> 17:02.200
I'M SORRY.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.367
PERSONALIZE IT.

17:04.700 --> 17:06.600
I'M SORRY, AMBER.

17:06.600 --> 17:09.600
IF THERE'S
ONE THING I'VE LEARNED
HANGING AROUND HERE,

17:09.600 --> 17:13.500
IT'S THAT ANIMALS
ARE LIKE PEOPLE.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.467
THEY HAVE
REAL EMOTIONS.

17:15.467 --> 17:17.600
I JUST WISH I COULD
GET HER TO EAT.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.467
MAYBE YOU'LL
HAVE BETTER LUCK.

17:19.467 --> 17:20.700
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

17:20.700 --> 17:21.967
CORY.

17:21.967 --> 17:24.900
CORY, I HOPE YOU FIND
WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

17:28.834 --> 17:33.300
SO, AMBER, YOU'RE SEPARATED
FROM YOUR MATE, HUH?

17:33.300 --> 17:35.033
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

17:35.033 --> 17:38.300
NOT THAT TOPANGA'S
MY MATE OR ANYTHING.

17:38.300 --> 17:41.100
I JUST BELIEVE SHE IS.

17:41.100 --> 17:42.400
IT'S FUNNY, THOUGH,
YOU KNOW.

17:42.400 --> 17:45.467
PEOPLE TELL YOU
TO GET ON WITH YOUR LIFE,

17:45.467 --> 17:46.600
GO DATE,

17:46.600 --> 17:49.033
THERE'S PLENTY
OF OTHER FISH IN THE SEA.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.600
LIKE I NEED TO TELL YOU.

17:53.600 --> 17:58.000
BUT, SEE, WE KNOW
THAT ONCE YOU'VE MET
THAT SPECIAL PERSON,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.200
IT'S HARD TO LIVE

17:59.200 --> 18:01.100
KNOWING THAT THEY'RE
OUT THERE

18:01.100 --> 18:02.734
AND THEY'RE THE ONLY ONE
YOU CARE ABOUT.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.000
ALL THOSE THINGS I DID,

18:06.000 --> 18:08.867
I WASN'T JUST TRYING
TO IMPRESS HER.

18:08.867 --> 18:13.233
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO EXPRESS MY FEELINGS.

18:13.233 --> 18:16.300
WELL, AT LEAST I'VE TRIED,
YOU KNOW,

18:16.300 --> 18:20.100
AND NOW I'M TALKING
TO A FISH.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.233
SEE YA, AMBER.

18:50.834 --> 18:53.300
CORY, I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID. WAIT!

18:53.300 --> 18:56.667
NO. TOPANGA,
I HEARD YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR.

18:56.667 --> 18:57.734
BUT CORY--

18:57.734 --> 18:59.767
I UNDERSTAND YOU.
ALL RIGHT?

18:59.767 --> 19:02.367
I'M NOT GOING TO
CHASE YOU ANYMORE.

19:02.367 --> 19:04.100
WE'LL JUST GO BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS,

19:04.100 --> 19:06.900
OR WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO BE.

19:06.900 --> 19:10.100
YOU FLEW ACROSS
THE COUNTRY TO SEE ME.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.200
I KNOW, O.K.?
I'M EMBARRASSED.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.667
I DIDN'T EVEN GET
THE FREE MILES.

19:14.667 --> 19:16.934
YOU DRESSED
IN SILLY OUTFITS,
SWAM WITH SHARKS.

19:16.934 --> 19:19.000
THERE WERE SHARKS
IN THERE?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.200
YOU WEREN'T GOING
TO GIVE UP.

19:21.200 --> 19:23.233
I TOLD YOU I'M SORRY.

19:23.233 --> 19:24.100
NO...

19:24.100 --> 19:25.600
NO.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.200
NOW IT'S MY TURN
TO TELL YOU I'M SORRY.

19:29.200 --> 19:33.867
I NEVER REALIZED
THESE THINGS CAME
FROM YOUR HEART...

19:35.467 --> 19:37.033
UNTIL NOW.

19:42.467 --> 19:45.467
WAIT, I'M
REALLY CONFUSED.

19:45.467 --> 19:47.500
SO AM I.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.300
SO WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:49.300 --> 19:53.200
I MEAN,
ARE WE FRIENDS OR WHAT?

19:54.467 --> 19:56.300
OR WHAT.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.600
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

20:02.600 --> 20:06.300
I DON'T KNOW.
WE DID BREAK UP
FOR A REASON, RIGHT?

20:06.300 --> 20:08.100
YEAH, WE DID.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.467
AND THAT REASON WAS...

20:11.467 --> 20:14.734
SO WE COULD
GET BACK TOGETHER.

20:40.600 --> 20:44.767
GONE FOR TWO DAYS.
WHAT WERE YOU GOING
TO TELL US?

20:44.767 --> 20:48.934
I WAS OUT FRONT
CHIPPING GOLF BALLS?

20:48.934 --> 20:51.000
FOR STARTERS,
THIS HOUSE AND SCHOOL

20:51.000 --> 20:54.200
ARE THE ONLY PLACES
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE
FOR THE NEXT MONTH.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.500
A MONTH?

20:55.500 --> 20:58.233
I GOT MORE THE TIME
I SAID [BLEEP].

20:58.233 --> 21:00.400
MORGAN!
MORGAN!

21:00.400 --> 21:01.600
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

21:01.600 --> 21:03.600
YOU'RE GROUNDED
FOR TWO MONTHS.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.367
I GOT TO LEARN
SELF-CONTROL.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.400
OH, AND, COREY...

21:07.400 --> 21:09.934
GO AHEAD, MORGAN.
KICK ME WHEN I'M DOWN.

21:09.934 --> 21:13.000
I THOUGHT WHAT
YOU DID FOR TOPANGA
WAS REALLY SWEET.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.567
I HOPE SOMEDAY
A BOY DOES THAT FOR ME.

21:17.800 --> 21:18.967
LOOK...

21:18.967 --> 21:21.033
WHAT I DID
WAS WRONG, O.K.?

21:21.033 --> 21:24.200
JUST IN CASE
THERE'S ANY CHANCE
OF LENIENCY,

21:24.200 --> 21:27.233
HERE. SNOW DOMES
FROM DISNEY WORLD.

21:27.233 --> 21:29.033
UPSTAIRS.

21:29.033 --> 21:30.900
THEN I'LL BE
TAKING THESE BACK.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.400
CORY...

21:37.400 --> 21:41.500
I'M GLAD
EVERYTHING WORKED OUT
WITH YOU AND TOPANGA.

21:41.500 --> 21:42.500
ME, TOO, MOM.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.600
YOU MAY
KEEP YOURS.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.600
HEY, MOM, DAD.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.300
YOU, SIT DOWN.

21:53.300 --> 21:56.600
WE KNOW IT WAS YOU
WHO COVERED FOR CORY.

21:56.600 --> 22:00.600
WITHOUT EVIDENCE,
THERE'S NO WAY TO TIE ME
TO THIS MESSY AFFAIR,

22:00.600 --> 22:02.400
SO I BID YOU FAREWELL.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.400
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

22:04.400 --> 22:05.867
AH, MR. MATTHEWS...

22:07.600 --> 22:09.734
I WAS PLANTING
IN THE GARDEN,

22:09.734 --> 22:11.033
AND I DUG THIS UP.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.934
I BELIEVE IT'S YOURS.

22:17.300 --> 22:19.400
OH, COME ON.
IS THIS THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?
