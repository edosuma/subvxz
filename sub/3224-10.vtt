WEBVTT

00:05.560 --> 00:07.085
- You're dying, Sam.
- Shut up.

00:07.760 --> 00:09.240
Ezekiel.
He's a good soldier.

00:09.320 --> 00:11.766
There is a chance I can fix
your brother, from the inside.

00:11.920 --> 00:12.921
I'm trusting you, Zeke.

00:13.080 --> 00:15.003
Metatron tricked me.
He took my grace.

00:15.200 --> 00:16.200
It's why I'm human.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.890
There is no putting
the angels back in heaven.

00:18.040 --> 00:19.040
Heaven is locked.

00:19.200 --> 00:21.328
Damn it, Cass,
there's a war on and it's on you!

00:21.480 --> 00:24.882
I know who you are.
And it isn't Ezekiel. Gadreel.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.082
You intend to be the ruler
of this new heaven.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.208
I will join you,
as second-in-command.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.408
Here's the first
name on your to-do list.

00:32.119 --> 00:34.407
My name is Abaddon.
War is what I do, it's my job.

00:34.560 --> 00:36.847
I can get you new bodies.
I will march into hell.

00:37.000 --> 00:39.651
And all the humans
and all the angels will bow to me!

00:39.800 --> 00:41.325
Angels are slaughtering one another.

00:41.480 --> 00:42.606
It's open warfare.

00:42.760 --> 00:44.364
No one will survive this war.

00:45.120 --> 00:47.805
I did what I had to
to get my grace back.

00:50.120 --> 00:52.439
No! No, no.

00:56.560 --> 00:57.561
Kevin?

02:28.120 --> 02:30.361
Corey! Corey!

02:34.080 --> 02:36.924
You're on in ten. The label wants you
to open with "Baby Be My Baby."

02:37.080 --> 02:38.525
Then you can roll right on
into "Babycakes"

02:38.720 --> 02:41.371
and then the clean version
of "Babymaker."

02:41.520 --> 02:46.560
Oh, and Corey, let's try to take it
easy with the groupies tonight, huh?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.006
Yeah, whatever.

02:50.520 --> 02:51.931
What the hell?
Security!

02:52.080 --> 02:55.448
It's fine, Margey.
You can go.

02:55.600 --> 02:56.806
What?
Corey!

02:56.960 --> 02:58.849
Bitch, did I stutter?

03:07.360 --> 03:09.328
Hello, Gadreel.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.450
Thaddeus.
That's a new look, I must say.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.840
Well, what can I say, you know?

03:13.960 --> 03:17.407
We all got booted outta the penthouse
and I just kinda figured

03:17.560 --> 03:19.642
why be an angel,
when you can be a god?

03:23.800 --> 03:26.406
- How are you, old friend?
- I am not your friend.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.444
Well, I think you're
being a little bit mean there.

03:29.640 --> 03:31.722
Considering all the quality
time we spent together.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.963
I was imprisoned.
And you tortured me.

03:35.120 --> 03:36.645
Heaven has rules.

03:36.800 --> 03:38.689
Do the crime, do the time.
That's it.

03:38.840 --> 03:41.810
- I made a mistake.
- I was a guard.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.485
I was doing my job.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.404
What you did to Abner...
Was that your job?

03:45.560 --> 03:48.769
Your boyfriend?
No, that... That was just fun.

03:50.360 --> 03:53.569
Is that what you're here for?
The big payback?

03:54.480 --> 03:57.245
Fine. If you wanna
get a little bloody,

03:57.400 --> 04:00.165
I have no problem
kicking your ass. Again.

04:00.320 --> 04:03.005
You know, we'll say,
for old time's sake.

04:05.560 --> 04:06.846
Looking for this?

04:09.840 --> 04:11.683
Gadreel...

04:16.160 --> 04:17.286
I'm sorry...

04:31.240 --> 04:33.527
Dean?

04:33.680 --> 04:35.284
Cass.

04:35.440 --> 04:37.727
Look at you,
all suited up and back in the game.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.125
I...

04:42.520 --> 04:45.205
I came as soon as you called. I...

04:51.040 --> 04:54.203
Dean, what happened?
What's wrong?

05:08.040 --> 05:11.442
Sammy was dyin'.
What was I supposed to do?

05:11.600 --> 05:13.284
You let an angel possess him?

05:13.440 --> 05:16.011
He said it was the only way
and I believed him.

05:17.360 --> 05:22.400
- Now, Sam's gone and Kevin's...
- Dean, I'm sorry.

05:22.560 --> 05:27.248
Yeah, well,
"sorry" don't pay the bills, does it?

05:28.000 --> 05:30.685
Sure as hell ain't
gonna bring Kevin back.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.328
We gotta find this son of a bitch.

05:37.440 --> 05:42.606
Dean, if the angel possessing Sam
isn't Ezekiel, then who is it?

05:45.400 --> 05:47.243
A dead man walking.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.607
- What, are you gonna destroy him?
- Damn right.

05:49.760 --> 05:51.808
You kill an angel,
its vessel dies, too.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.929
You think I don't know that?

05:57.160 --> 06:03.122
If I don't end Sam,
then that halo burns him out and I...

06:07.560 --> 06:09.608
God, I was so damn stupid.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.966
You were stupid
for the right reasons.

06:14.120 --> 06:16.726
- Yeah, like that matters.
- It does.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.645
Sometimes, that's all that matters.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.611
Listen to me.
Sam is strong.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.411
If he knew an angel was
possessing him, he could fight.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.528
He could cast the angel out.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.643
Maybe.

06:33.800 --> 06:37.566
But far as I know,
he's in the dark.

06:37.720 --> 06:39.370
I don't know how we clue him in.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.562
- Do you remember Alfie?
- That kid angel?

06:43.720 --> 06:45.051
Yeah, why?

06:45.200 --> 06:49.489
Before he died, he told me the demons
were able to dig into his mind,

06:49.640 --> 06:51.130
access his coding.

06:51.280 --> 06:52.850
We might be able to do that here.

06:53.000 --> 06:56.846
Might be able to... to bypass the
angel and talk directly to Sam.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.923
- And you think that would work?
- I don't know.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.320
But I think we should try.

07:00.520 --> 07:03.091
Okay, where do we start?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.204
Hello, boys.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.282
You're gonna
tell us how to hack an angel,

07:21.440 --> 07:23.240
and I'm gonna give you
some of the good stuff.

07:24.400 --> 07:27.210
Human blood.
Fresh from the tap.

07:27.360 --> 07:30.204
- Word is you're jonesin' for it.
- Please. I'll pass.

07:30.360 --> 07:34.968
- What do you want, then?
- Well, for starters... a massage.

07:36.040 --> 07:38.850
Between the sitting and the shackles,
body gets a little stiff.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.207
- Yeah, I ain't rubbin' you.
- God, no.

07:41.360 --> 07:42.885
Get Kevin.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.647
- His tiny fists can really work won...
- Kevin is dead.

07:48.480 --> 07:49.480
Oh.

07:52.360 --> 07:56.251
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Don't pretend you care.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.371
- You tried to kill him.
- I told him this was gonna happen.

08:00.520 --> 08:03.490
I was the only person
who tried to warn him.

08:03.640 --> 08:05.927
- I told him to run.
- From what?

08:06.080 --> 08:07.081
You.

08:08.200 --> 08:10.362
How many times am I gonna
have to say this?

08:10.520 --> 08:15.321
People in your general vicinity don't
have much in the way of a lifespan.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.371
Now, I can't teach you
how to crack open an angel.

08:19.560 --> 08:23.406
It's more art than science.
But I can do it for you.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.571
All I ask in return
is a little field trip.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.200
Dying for some fresh air.

08:30.400 --> 08:32.129
Chains on, naturally.

08:33.240 --> 08:34.605
No.

08:34.760 --> 08:36.364
No, of course not.

08:36.520 --> 08:39.443
Because if I'm Plan A,
I'm sure you have a totally viable,

08:39.600 --> 08:41.807
much better Plan B.

08:50.840 --> 08:52.968
You can't be considering this.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.720
With the chains on,
he can't do anything.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.968
It's Crowley.
He can always do something.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.805
Looks like we need a tie-breaker.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.610
Go get Moose, Squirrel.

09:05.800 --> 09:07.404
Unless...

09:07.560 --> 09:09.244
Unless, of course, you can't.

09:09.440 --> 09:11.966
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

09:12.120 --> 09:15.841
The poor, giant baby's
in trouble again, isn't he?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.681
- Are you done?
- Depends.

09:19.840 --> 09:22.002
- Do we have a deal?
- Yeah.

09:22.200 --> 09:24.089
Excellent.
When do we leave?

09:25.480 --> 09:27.209
Soon as I can scrounge up a ride.

09:28.840 --> 09:31.491
Well, I have a vehicle.

09:31.640 --> 09:34.803
It stopped a few miles from here,
inexplicably.

09:57.560 --> 09:58.891
Really?

09:59.040 --> 10:00.724
What are you, a pimp?

10:01.960 --> 10:03.610
I like it.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.043
Yeah, it's outta gas.

10:09.200 --> 10:12.727
Why do you need the wheels?

10:14.720 --> 10:18.247
When you betray us,
I'll be the one to carve out your heart.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.482
Oh, Cass, such a flirt.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.048
- All right, let's go.
- Shotgun.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.124
Uh... wrong.
You're in the back.

10:31.560 --> 10:34.370
Hey. You, too.
Keep an eye on him.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.009
- Hey.
- Watch the leg!

10:45.200 --> 10:48.522
- You're on my side!
- Hey, hey!

11:03.400 --> 11:05.641
- Get you anything else?
- I'm good, thanks.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.284
Welcome home, sweethearts.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.449
Strange seeing an old vessel,
isn't it?

11:23.600 --> 11:26.922
Like looking in a funhouse mirror.

11:29.040 --> 11:33.682
But first things first.
The tasks I gave you, any hiccups?

11:33.840 --> 11:37.686
Killing Thaddeus was easy.
He had it coming.

11:37.880 --> 11:41.327
I know all about your history.
Why do you think I gave you his name?

11:42.360 --> 11:45.489
Consider it your signing bonus.

11:45.680 --> 11:46.681
And the kid?

11:46.840 --> 11:51.528
That was... less easy.

11:51.680 --> 11:52.966
He was a threat.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.602
But I flipped a switch upstairs,
and now that Kevin is gone,

11:56.760 --> 11:59.127
there will be no more prophets.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.642
And what about Dean Winchester?

12:03.800 --> 12:07.850
You never gave me
his name, Metatron.

12:08.000 --> 12:11.641
Not much for seizing the initiative,
are we?

12:11.800 --> 12:17.204
Gadreel, we are writing
our own epic story here.

12:17.360 --> 12:21.524
To make that work, sometimes
you have to kill your darlings.

12:21.680 --> 12:23.569
It's not like you haven't
done worse before.

12:25.480 --> 12:28.370
Sorry. Sorry.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.488
On to new business.

12:32.360 --> 12:33.566
Your next target.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.366
How many more lives
do I have to take?

12:42.280 --> 12:45.921
It's not your place to ask questions.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.481
It is your place to obey.

12:48.640 --> 12:52.884
You wanna be my second-in-command,
prove you're ready.

12:53.080 --> 12:55.003
Prove you're loyal.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.204
Or don't.
Walk away.

13:00.360 --> 13:04.729
Go back to being Gadreel, the traitor.
The sap.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.042
Heaven's longest-running joke.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.882
Abaddon?
I found him.

13:33.560 --> 13:35.642
Crowley is on the move.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.369
Your source is in here?

13:48.520 --> 13:50.329
And she can track
anything you need.

13:50.480 --> 13:52.960
Even a little lost Samantha.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.406
How?

13:54.600 --> 13:57.410
Well, this place isn't really...
this.

13:57.600 --> 14:00.524
It's a front
for an NSA listening post.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.842
- What are they listening for?
- Everything.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.685
The US government is
quite the voyeur these days.

14:07.480 --> 14:10.484
So, I planted one of my best
and let her go to work.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.809
Looking for terrorists?

14:13.960 --> 14:16.122
Looking for marks, Slow Boat.

14:16.280 --> 14:18.599
Mr. Crowley?
She'll see you now.

14:18.600 --> 14:20.967
Just Mr. Crowley.

14:22.400 --> 14:25.324
I'll be listening to
every word you say.

14:25.440 --> 14:26.601
Promise?

14:32.120 --> 14:34.361
Cecily.
How are you?

14:34.560 --> 14:35.766
Better than you.

14:35.920 --> 14:38.924
That was Dean Winchester,
and... Castiel?

14:39.080 --> 14:42.607
Yes, I know. Without the tie,
he's barely recognizable.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.330
- So...
- Hot.

14:44.480 --> 14:48.326
I mean, human Castiel? Eh.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.767
But feathered Castiel...

14:50.920 --> 14:52.251
"Human Castiel"?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.880
You heard what
happened to him, right?

14:54.000 --> 14:56.844
I've been tied up.
Pray, do tell.

14:59.600 --> 15:01.921
Hear anything?

15:02.080 --> 15:03.764
No.

15:03.960 --> 15:07.123
The room Crowley's in
has been warded.

15:07.280 --> 15:10.250
Awesome.
That's frigging awesome.

15:10.400 --> 15:13.529
So Captain Sexy out there
totally cuts another angel's throat,

15:13.720 --> 15:17.247
yoinks his grace,
and now he's got his mojo back.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.526
Minus the broken wings.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.569
Well, that explains the hooptie.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.200
And we know all this how?

15:23.400 --> 15:26.085
I tuned one of our satellites
to pick up Angel Radio.

15:26.240 --> 15:28.527
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.126
- Not just a pretty face.
- What about hell?

15:31.280 --> 15:33.567
No one's doing their job.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.569
I send oodles of data
down there every week,

15:35.720 --> 15:37.768
but does hell give a damn?
No.

15:37.920 --> 15:40.764
Well, of course,
with Abaddon in charge, you...

15:40.960 --> 15:42.849
Oh, that 'B' with an 'itch'
ain't the boss.

15:43.040 --> 15:47.329
I mean, she's got a few of the more
aggro types on her side,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.687
but most are just waiting
to see who takes the belt.

15:50.800 --> 15:52.131
You or her.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.169
They're still afraid of me.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.527
Probably 'cause
they don't know you're in cuffs.

15:57.360 --> 15:58.964
Speaking of which...

16:00.720 --> 16:03.883
- Do they come off?
- Not without the key.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.921
Fine.

16:08.480 --> 16:12.963
I need you to do me a favor.
Can you find this car for me?

16:19.000 --> 16:21.162
Nice to know someone's still loyal.

16:21.320 --> 16:22.765
Uh-huh.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.602
That is, of course,
if you're not playing both sides.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.289
Wouldn't you?

16:42.240 --> 16:44.322
Your phallus-on-wheels
just ran a red light

16:44.520 --> 16:47.046
in Somerset, Pennsylvania,
ten minutes ago.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.406
Let's go.

16:51.640 --> 16:52.801
The Three Amigos ride again.

16:52.960 --> 16:55.406
He's not my amigo.

17:18.680 --> 17:21.604
- Alexander Sarver?
- Yeah?

17:29.800 --> 17:32.041
- Gadreel.
- Abner.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.804
I thought you were dead.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.728
What happened? What...
What are you doing, here?

17:36.880 --> 17:39.406
I...
What are you doing, here?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.800
Daddy, Daddy!

17:44.600 --> 17:46.443
Hey.

17:46.600 --> 17:49.604
Delilah, this is Daddy's best friend.

17:49.760 --> 17:51.728
- Can you say, "Hi"?
- Hi.

17:53.800 --> 17:58.089
- You have a child.
- I have a family, Gadreel.

17:58.240 --> 18:02.245
Look, my wife and the niblet
are going to a movie.

18:02.400 --> 18:04.448
Swing back in a few hours
so we can catch up, okay?

18:04.640 --> 18:06.768
Okay, sure.

18:14.240 --> 18:18.086
So... you have a job?

18:18.280 --> 18:21.250
Customer support.
Computers, mostly.

18:21.400 --> 18:24.688
It's like answering prayers,
but they pay you for it.

18:25.960 --> 18:27.246
You have changed, Abner.

18:27.400 --> 18:30.529
Yeah, well,
I was a crappy angel.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.524
I was petulant.
I deserted my post.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.002
I spent 700 years
in heaven's lock-up. I've...

18:40.160 --> 18:44.131
No, doesn't matter.

18:44.280 --> 18:46.089
We're a long way from Thaddeus now.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.730
I killed him, Abner.

18:50.600 --> 18:52.090
I got our revenge.

18:52.240 --> 18:55.130
I... I wish you hadn't done that.

18:55.320 --> 18:57.322
But Why?

18:57.480 --> 18:59.881
He tortured us.
You most of all.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.166
I remember.

19:02.440 --> 19:04.840
And I remember you were always there
to put me back together.

19:04.920 --> 19:06.729
- We were friends.
- We are friends.

19:07.600 --> 19:10.683
And the fall,
it's our second chance.

19:10.840 --> 19:12.808
We can forget our
old hates, who we were.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.367
- It's not that easy.
- Yes, it is.

19:16.240 --> 19:17.651
Look at me.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.202
I'm happy.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.486
And your vessel, is he happy?

19:24.680 --> 19:26.682
He was an abusive ass.

19:28.120 --> 19:32.489
But I love my family
and they love me.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.042
I'm not a wise man, Gadreel.

19:39.920 --> 19:43.561
But I know this.
The key to happiness.

19:43.720 --> 19:48.965
It's getting the one thing you
want most and never letting it go.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.400
- And what if there's a price?
- There's always a price.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.085
But it's worth paying.

21:06.120 --> 21:07.929
You should not have
come here, Dean.

21:10.440 --> 21:11.521
You killed my friend.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.330
Then you take my brother.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.005
And you think I'm gonna
let that stand?

21:15.160 --> 21:16.685
I allowed you to live.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.689
Mistake.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.006
So, Crowley was here?

21:45.160 --> 21:47.242
Yeah, I...
I thought you'd wanna know.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.607
You thought right.

21:49.760 --> 21:52.081
And now, any idea where
he scampered off to?

21:52.240 --> 21:54.163
Somerset, Pennsylvania.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.885
With Dean Winchester
and the angel Castiel.

21:58.440 --> 22:00.568
And you know this how?

22:01.680 --> 22:03.728
They're chasing an Impala.

22:03.920 --> 22:05.160
I helped them track it.

22:05.320 --> 22:08.005
You helped Crowley?

22:09.080 --> 22:10.081
Yeah.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.771
I'm kinda playing both sides,
until someone...

22:15.000 --> 22:17.241
Until you win.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.320
Smart, right?

22:31.440 --> 22:33.124
No.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.410
Sort of the opposite.

22:54.360 --> 22:55.964
Welcome to the party, pal.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.645
Cass, how we lookin'?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.041
Most of Sam's internal burns
have healed.

23:00.200 --> 23:01.770
I should be able to fix the rest.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.285
What's your name?

23:04.160 --> 23:06.925
I thought I knew every angel
in heaven, but I've never seen you.

23:07.080 --> 23:10.129
Why would I tell you anything?

23:10.320 --> 23:12.322
Well, I don't give
a damn who you are.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.329
You need to get out.
Now!

23:15.480 --> 23:16.561
And if I don't?

23:16.720 --> 23:20.645
Then you and I will have
a lovely little play-date.

23:20.800 --> 23:25.010
Even bound,
I can rip this body apart.

23:25.160 --> 23:27.606
- Tell them, Castiel.
- You do, you die.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.842
You want this to end?

23:33.240 --> 23:36.687
Go ahead. Put a blade
through your brother's heart.

23:43.240 --> 23:48.007
If it makes you feel better,
I have Sam locked away in a dream.

23:48.160 --> 23:50.401
As far as he knows, the two of you
are working a case right now.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.962
Something with ghouls
and cheerleaders.

23:55.920 --> 23:57.524
Why are you doin' this?

23:59.440 --> 24:01.090
We fought together.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.049
I trusted you.

24:04.280 --> 24:06.248
I thought you were
one of the good guys!

24:09.040 --> 24:11.361
I am doing what I have to do.

24:14.720 --> 24:16.051
So am I.

24:28.880 --> 24:30.450
So am I.

25:16.360 --> 25:17.885
Hey.

25:18.760 --> 25:20.603
I can't watch that anymore.

25:22.400 --> 25:23.526
I understand.

25:23.680 --> 25:26.763
It's not Sam, but... it's still Sam.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.803
Pretty much, yeah.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.645
How are you doin'?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.363
What, you want to
talk about me now?

25:37.520 --> 25:39.320
I wanna talk about anything
that's not a demon

25:39.440 --> 25:41.283
stickin' needles into
my brother's brain.

25:46.640 --> 25:48.881
Yeah, humor me, man.
How you doin'?

25:50.840 --> 25:54.083
I'm... I'm okay.

25:57.280 --> 25:58.486
Good, good.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.449
That's...

26:02.640 --> 26:05.240
So, what, did you just change the
batteries out and power back up?

26:05.360 --> 26:06.600
It's that easy?

26:07.520 --> 26:11.320
It wasn't easy,
but I didn't have a choice.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.170
Yeah.

26:14.320 --> 26:16.322
Well, that's usually how it goes.

26:18.240 --> 26:21.767
Cass... I'm sorry.

26:21.920 --> 26:24.366
- About what?
- Kickin' you outta the bunker.

26:24.560 --> 26:26.210
That's...

26:26.360 --> 26:28.169
You know,
not tellin' you about Sam.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.800
You thought his life was at stake.

26:30.960 --> 26:33.008
Yeah, I got played.

26:33.160 --> 26:36.130
I thought I was saving heaven.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.651
I got played, too.

26:37.800 --> 26:40.531
So, you're sayin'
we're both a couple of dumbasses?

26:40.680 --> 26:43.923
I prefer the word "trusting."

26:44.120 --> 26:46.248
Less dumb, less ass.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.165
Laverne, Shirley, get in here!

26:56.360 --> 26:58.044
Pinhead's out cold.

26:58.200 --> 26:59.565
But watch this.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.846
What's he sayin'?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.685
His name.
Gadreel.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.211
Does that mean something to you?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.606
Well, it's why I've never seen him.

27:18.760 --> 27:21.843
He's been in prison
since the dawn of time.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.800
Gadreel was the sentry who
allowed Lucifer into the Garden.

27:25.960 --> 27:28.167
My, my... a celebrity.

27:28.320 --> 27:30.766
Wait, "the Garden"?
Like, Eden?

27:30.960 --> 27:32.450
Adam and Eve, fig leaves Garden?

27:32.600 --> 27:34.489
It's his fault.

27:34.640 --> 27:39.965
All of it.
The corruption of man, demons, hell.

27:40.120 --> 27:42.168
God left because of him.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.322
The archangels...

27:44.480 --> 27:46.164
The apocalypse.

27:46.320 --> 27:50.120
If he hadn't been so weak,
none of it would have happened.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.931
You ruined the universe,
you damn son of a bitch!

27:53.120 --> 27:54.963
Cass.
Cass, hey!

27:56.040 --> 27:58.247
- Dean, he...
- I get it.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.804
But you gotta chill.

28:16.560 --> 28:18.369
What's taking so long?

28:18.520 --> 28:21.251
Other than the fact that
I'm trying to unravel a living,

28:21.400 --> 28:24.290
multi-dimensional knot
of pure energy, not much.

28:30.880 --> 28:32.484
It won't work.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.805
You will never find your brother.

28:40.160 --> 28:42.925
Go ahead.
Poke and prod.

28:43.080 --> 28:46.084
I can sit in this chair
for years and watch you fail,

28:46.280 --> 28:49.727
over and over again.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.247
I've endured much worse
than this, Dean.

28:53.400 --> 28:56.131
So much worse.

28:56.280 --> 28:57.760
And I have all the time in the world.

28:57.800 --> 28:59.290
Shut up!

29:02.560 --> 29:04.324
All right, Plan B.

29:04.480 --> 29:07.290
Cass, you gotta possess him.

29:07.440 --> 29:08.771
- What?
- Do it now!

29:08.920 --> 29:10.126
Get in there.

29:10.280 --> 29:14.080
Tell Sam what's goin' on and help him
kick that lyin' son of a bitch out.

29:14.240 --> 29:19.167
It might work, but I can't possess
a vessel without permission.

29:22.680 --> 29:24.682
No.
Not happening.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.365
Don't be daft.

29:26.520 --> 29:28.682
Demons can take what they want.

29:28.840 --> 29:31.161
I can burrow into
that rat's nest of a head.

29:32.320 --> 29:33.845
I can wake Sam up.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.841
Just call me Plan C.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.840
- You can't...
- You got a better idea?

29:40.040 --> 29:42.361
What about the angel?

29:42.520 --> 29:43.885
I'll Work fast.

29:44.040 --> 29:46.202
- And if he finds you?
- I'll run.

29:46.360 --> 29:47.400
I'm not dying for you lot.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.400
Of course, if I do this,
you're gonna have to...

29:49.440 --> 29:50.720
Take off the leash.
Yeah, I know.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.211
And it stays off.

29:53.160 --> 29:56.369
I save Sam,
I leave here a free man.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.085
Do we have a deal?

30:02.880 --> 30:04.405
Cass, burn off Sam's tattoo.

30:06.240 --> 30:07.890
- Dean...
- Do it.

30:09.080 --> 30:10.320
Do it.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.401
If you mess with Sam,
if you try anything...

30:28.560 --> 30:30.483
I keep my bargains.

30:30.680 --> 30:34.924
Besides, I don't wanna be inside your
brother any longer than I have to.

30:35.080 --> 30:37.481
I'm not one for sloppy seconds.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.886
When you find him,
say, "Poughkeepsie."

30:57.120 --> 30:59.407
It's our go-word.
Means "drop everything and run."

30:59.560 --> 31:00.925
Fine.

31:01.080 --> 31:04.448
While I'm gone,
hands off the suit.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.124
I will destroy you.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.086
Eat me.

31:34.000 --> 31:36.685
A demon and an angel
walk into my brother.

31:36.840 --> 31:39.207
Sounds like a bad joke.

31:39.840 --> 31:42.810
Dean, if this doesn't work...

31:47.160 --> 31:48.650
It'll work.

31:54.640 --> 31:55.971
It just doesn't make any sense.

31:56.120 --> 31:58.282
Why is this ghoul only
chomping on dead cheerleaders?

31:58.440 --> 32:00.920
- Hey, you want a beer?
- No, I'm fine.

32:01.080 --> 32:02.320
Not bad.

32:02.520 --> 32:04.522
Dean? Dean!

32:04.680 --> 32:05.681
Poughkeepsie.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.126
How do you know that word?

32:10.320 --> 32:13.210
Because Dean sent me, Bullwinkle.
The real Dean.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.681
I'll make this quick.
You've been possessed by angel.

32:15.840 --> 32:18.764
He's got you packed away in some
dusty corner of your own mind

32:18.920 --> 32:20.763
and I'm here to break you out.

32:23.160 --> 32:24.161
Seriously?

32:24.320 --> 32:28.370
Fine, we'll do this the fun way.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.206
See? Not real.
Like I said.

32:34.360 --> 32:36.840
I know how possession works, Sam.

32:37.000 --> 32:40.721
You've seen everything that he's seen,
even if you can't remember.

32:40.880 --> 32:44.521
So, what I need you to do,
I need you to remember.

33:01.040 --> 33:05.682
- Did I kill Kevin?
- No, you didn't. He did.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.448
You need to take control, Sam.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.125
Blow it up.

33:12.280 --> 33:16.729
And cast that
punk-ass holy roller out!

33:19.600 --> 33:21.045
What?

33:23.600 --> 33:24.965
Oh, bollocks.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.450
Hello, Sam.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.683
- Who are you?
- His name is Gadreel.

33:31.840 --> 33:35.606
- The original chump.
- Was a chump.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.250
And now?

33:37.400 --> 33:41.007
I'm going to be the one that
leads my kind back to heaven.

33:41.200 --> 33:42.611
I'm going to be a hero.

33:42.760 --> 33:48.642
But you, demon, for all your chatter,
you will always be a coward.

33:50.680 --> 33:52.603
You should be running.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.647
Give up, boy,
you're not strong enough!

34:18.440 --> 34:21.603
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

34:21.760 --> 34:23.170
Get out of my...

34:26.040 --> 34:27.485
You sure you want me to go?

34:27.639 --> 34:30.484
Maybe I'm the only thing
holding you together.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.090
I leave, you might die.

34:39.080 --> 34:44.882
I said, get... the hell... out.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.844
- Waiting for someone?
- I am.

35:00.000 --> 35:01.684
And he's late.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.565
Yes.

35:24.360 --> 35:28.604
Lemme guess...
Winchester trouble?

35:35.040 --> 35:36.610
Sam! Cass!

35:40.280 --> 35:41.441
I'm fine. Thanks for asking.

35:41.640 --> 35:44.530
Sam, are you okay?

35:45.400 --> 35:46.401
Cass?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.164
It's Abaddon.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.563
Go. The back door.
I'll handle this.

36:10.720 --> 36:12.085
Oh, 'cause you're such a good guy?

36:12.240 --> 36:13.760
Right now,
I'm the goodest guy you got.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.526
This don't make us square.

36:18.960 --> 36:19.927
- I see you again...
- I'm dead.

36:20.120 --> 36:21.485
Yes, I know.
I love you, too.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.929
Pleasure doing business
with you boys, as always.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.809
Hello, darling.

36:55.120 --> 36:56.121
Crowley.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.485
Bring me his head.

37:04.880 --> 37:08.646
See, that's the thing about demons...
they're only obedient to a point.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.362
Right.
Let's have a chat.

37:12.520 --> 37:15.649
- I'm not here to talk.
- And I'm not talking to you.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.479
I'm talking to them,
the average demon,

37:18.480 --> 37:21.131
because I feel their pain.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.486
It must have been difficult,

37:22.640 --> 37:25.246
with your loving king
so cruelly taken from you.

37:25.400 --> 37:29.121
I imagine you felt... all at sea.

37:29.280 --> 37:32.090
And then, along came...
the brute.

37:32.240 --> 37:37.565
She's strong and
a knight and immortal.

37:37.720 --> 37:38.881
At the moment.

37:39.040 --> 37:42.328
So, I'm not surprised that
some of my more idiotic subjects

37:42.480 --> 37:44.528
bought her line.
But now?

37:44.680 --> 37:46.489
Good news, fellas.

37:48.760 --> 37:49.886
Daddy's home.

37:50.040 --> 37:51.929
Hell doesn't want you, Crowley.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.248
- It's mine.
- Is it?

37:54.400 --> 37:57.927
Not what I hear.
Not while I'm still kicking.

37:58.080 --> 38:00.120
Well, then, let's settle it.
You and me, right here.

38:00.160 --> 38:03.960
- Winner takes the crown.
- See, that's your problem, love.

38:04.120 --> 38:05.849
You think this is a fight.

38:07.920 --> 38:10.048
- It's not?
- It's a campaign.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.851
Hearts and minds,
that's what's important.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.604
See, the demons have a choice.

38:14.760 --> 38:18.082
Take orders
from the world's angriest ginger,

38:18.240 --> 38:22.165
and that's saying something,
or join my team,

38:22.360 --> 38:27.366
where everyone gets a say, a virgin
and all the entrails they can eat.

38:28.920 --> 38:30.763
So, think on this, lads.

38:30.920 --> 38:33.730
Spread the word.
Vote Crowley.

38:52.920 --> 38:55.048
You feel better?

38:57.200 --> 38:58.247
A little, yeah.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.763
It'll take time to fully heal you.

39:01.920 --> 39:04.605
We'll have to do it in stages.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.043
All right, let me hear it.

39:11.840 --> 39:14.002
What you do want me to say?
That I'm pissed?

39:15.080 --> 39:17.765
Okay, I am.
I'm pissed.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.570
You lied to me. Again.

39:21.720 --> 39:22.767
I didn't have a choice.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.611
I was ready to die, Dean.

39:25.800 --> 39:27.962
I know.

39:28.160 --> 39:29.571
But I wouldn't let you.

39:29.720 --> 39:32.041
Because that's not in me.

39:32.360 --> 39:34.442
So, what, you decide to...
To trick me

39:34.443 --> 39:40.243
into being possessed
by some psycho angel?

39:40.400 --> 39:41.765
- He saved your life.
- So what?

39:41.920 --> 39:43.763
I was willing to die.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.125
And now...

39:52.800 --> 39:55.041
- Kevin...
- No, that is not on you.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.164
Kevin's blood is on my hands.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.690
And that ain't ever getting clean.

40:01.840 --> 40:05.481
I'll burn for that.
I will.

40:05.640 --> 40:07.642
But I'll find Gadreel.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.251
And I will end
that son of a bitch.

40:12.520 --> 40:14.010
But I'll do it alone.

40:17.080 --> 40:19.128
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Come on, man.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.080
Can't you see?
I'm... I'm poison.

40:23.240 --> 40:26.767
Sam, people get close to me,
they get killed. Or worse.

40:28.360 --> 40:32.843
You know, I tell myself that I...
I help more people than I hurt.

40:33.000 --> 40:35.685
And I tell myself that I'm doing
it all for the right reasons

40:35.840 --> 40:37.569
and I believe that.

40:39.160 --> 40:40.844
But I can't, I won't...

40:42.840 --> 40:46.003
...drag anybody through
the muck with me. Not anymore.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.200
Go.

40:53.320 --> 40:55.448
I'm not gonna stop you.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.721
But don't go thinkin'
that's the problem, 'cause it's not.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.284
What's that supposed to mean?

41:13.720 --> 41:15.131
Just go.
