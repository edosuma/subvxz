Here's a typically

Senator Mendoza is one of the
most respected citizens in the
state, McBain

01:13.070 --> 01:16.570
and yet you ran his limo
off a cliff, broke the necks of
three of his bodyguards

through his front door?

That movie stinks like your

09:18.420 --> 09:19.620
in dramatic
interpretation.

09:19.690 --> 09:21.460
Thank you, Artie.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.850
My name's Homer Simpson.
I'd like to sign up
for something.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.560
Well, we have an opening
on the Debate team.

09:25.630 --> 09:26.830
Debate? Like arguing?

09:26.900 --> 09:27.570
Yes.

09:27.630 --> 09:28.500
I'll take that

09:28.560 --> 09:29.820
you stinkpot!

09:29.900 --> 09:32.370
<i>Just warming up,
Mrs. Bloomenstein.</i>

09:32.430 --> 09:33.890
This year's topic is

09:33.970 --> 09:35.940
Resolved:
The national speed limit

09:36.000 --> 09:38.230
should be lowered
to 55 miles per hour.

09:38.310 --> 09:41.310
55? That's ridiculous.

09:41.380 --> 09:44.220
Sure, that will save a few lives

09:44.280 --> 09:46.220
but millions will be late.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.120
Why don't you take 'con'.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.230
Hmm...

09:56.290 --> 09:58.300
No way.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.600
Artie:
<i>Our current speed limit</i>

09:59.660 --> 10:01.870
- is an anachronism.
- Ignoramus.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.400
Will you shut up.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.200
Wait a minute.
That word you keep
calling me--

10:05.270 --> 10:06.840
Ignoramus.
Ignoramus?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.540
It means I'm stupid,
doesn't it?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.700
There is a difference
between ignorance and stupidity.

10:10.770 --> 10:12.630
Not to me there isn't...
you.. ignoramus.

10:12.710 --> 10:13.440
<i>Homer...</i>

10:13.510 --> 10:14.880
You're the ignoramus.

10:14.940 --> 10:16.400
Homer, would you like
to present your rebuttal?

10:16.480 --> 10:17.980
With pleasure.

10:19.080 --> 10:20.050
( gasps )

10:20.120 --> 10:21.820
<i>( sighs )
Ay, caramba!</i>

10:25.390 --> 10:27.160
Hello.

10:27.220 --> 10:28.290
Hello.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.860
You may not remember me.

10:29.930 --> 10:30.660
<i>I'm Homer Simpson.</i>

10:30.730 --> 10:32.200
I mooned for rebuttal.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.560
Yes, I remember.

10:33.630 --> 10:36.070
So, you want
to go out with me?

10:36.130 --> 10:37.470
Well, I, uh...

10:37.530 --> 10:39.660
I don't think
you're my type.

10:39.730 --> 10:41.060
Well, you see

10:41.140 --> 10:43.470
the problem is
you don't know me.

10:43.540 --> 10:44.880
I have references.

10:44.940 --> 10:47.180
Just ask.. coach Flanagan

10:47.240 --> 10:49.150
and ask Mr. Sakofsky

10:49.210 --> 10:50.980
and Barney Gumble.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.920
I don't know.

10:52.980 --> 10:54.890
I'm not asking you
to like me.

10:54.950 --> 10:57.820
I'm not asking you to put
yourself in the position
where I can touch your goodies.

10:57.890 --> 10:59.520
I'm just asking you
to be fair.

10:59.590 --> 11:01.160
Homer Simpson? Oh, yeah.

11:01.220 --> 11:02.980
Junior varsity shot-putter.

11:03.060 --> 11:05.230
I think if he applies himself

11:05.290 --> 11:07.490
trains real hard,
hits the weights

11:07.560 --> 11:09.490
he could go another foot.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.630
I had him for four years.

11:11.700 --> 11:12.970
Solid "C" student.

11:13.030 --> 11:14.960
Made a lamp last year.

11:15.040 --> 11:18.840
He's all things to all men
and maybe to one lucky gal.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.910
Want to go to the prom
with me?

11:20.980 --> 11:22.580
Good God, no!

11:22.640 --> 11:24.310
Well put.

11:24.380 --> 11:25.980
Well, what's the good word?

11:26.050 --> 11:27.490
I'm sorry.

11:27.550 --> 11:28.590
What?

11:28.650 --> 11:30.620
You seem like
a nice enough guy

11:30.690 --> 11:32.390
but I don't really
don't have the time

11:32.450 --> 11:35.420
and the City Forensics
Championship is coming up.

11:35.490 --> 11:36.590
Yeah, so?

11:36.660 --> 11:38.230
And I tutor part time.

11:38.290 --> 11:38.850
You tutor?

11:38.930 --> 11:39.630
Yes.

11:39.690 --> 11:40.690
And anyone can be tutored?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.760
Just those who need help
with French.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.100
French.

11:44.170 --> 11:45.270
Mm-hmm.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.930
What a coincidence.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.540
Just the subject
I'm having trouble with.

11:49.600 --> 11:52.600
Why, you cagey old dog.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.630
Great story.

11:53.710 --> 11:55.110
Positively spellbinding.

11:55.180 --> 11:56.450
Work, damn you!

11:56.510 --> 11:58.180
Bart! Pay attention.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.290

to your own son one day

12:32.550 --> 12:34.590
Why is there
make-out music on?

12:34.650 --> 12:36.090
It helps me study.

12:36.150 --> 12:37.250
Well, not me.

12:37.320 --> 12:38.590
Shut it off

12:38.650 --> 12:40.410

down to business.

13:11.720 --> 13:13.420
Before, you couldn't
say <i>bonjour</i>

but now you can conjugate

13:14.790 --> 13:17.830
all the regular verbs,
two irregular verbs

and minutes later,
it's still there.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.980
And it's all thanks to you.

13:32.040 --> 13:35.080
Marge, when I see you forming
the vowels and continents...

13:35.140 --> 13:36.140
Consonants.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.920
Consonants with
your beautiful mouth

would you go
to the prom with me?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.160
You know, Homer

13:50.230 --> 13:52.900
you're like no one
I've ever met before.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.830
You're dear,
honest and open

13:54.900 --> 13:56.870
without a trace
of pretension.

13:56.930 --> 13:59.040
I'll take that as a compliment.

13:59.100 --> 14:00.100
So will you
go out with me?

14:00.170 --> 14:02.170
Please say <i>oui.</i>

14:02.240 --> 14:03.110
<i>Oui.</i>

14:03.170 --> 14:04.840
Whoo hoo Marge!
This will be

14:04.910 --> 14:06.110
the greatest night
of your life.

14:06.170 --> 14:08.170
I've been saving up
for a new engine for my car

14:08.240 --> 14:10.040
but I'm gonna spend it
all on us--

14:10.110 --> 14:11.280
I'm renting
the biggest limo

14:11.350 --> 14:13.180
<i>I'm gonna buy you

the widest lapels,
the most ruffles

and the highest
platform shoes you ever saw.

14:19.590 --> 14:22.330
Maybe I'll wear
my hair... up.

14:22.390 --> 14:24.030
Wait, wait, wait, Marge.

14:24.090 --> 14:26.660
If honest and open
is what you like

14:26.730 --> 14:28.630
get a load of this.

14:28.700 --> 14:31.500
I'm not really
in any French class.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.470
This was just a brilliant scheme
to get to know you better.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.310
Hmm!
( smack )

14:35.370 --> 14:36.710
Ow.

14:36.770 --> 14:39.780
You knew the city Forensics
finals are tomorrow

14:39.840 --> 14:42.350
and you kept me here
until 1:00 a.m.

14:42.410 --> 14:44.450
pretending to be stupid!

14:44.510 --> 14:46.970
Homer J. Simpson,
I hate you!

14:51.620 --> 14:53.460
Hey, Barney.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.530
Guess who's got a date
for the prom!

14:58.930 --> 15:00.330
Everything I know tells me
this story doesn't end

15:00.400 --> 15:02.970
with us sitting here
and you telling it to us.

15:03.030 --> 15:04.340
<i>Get off the edge of your seat.</i>

15:04.400 --> 15:06.670
They got married, had kids
and bought a cheap TV, okay?

15:06.730 --> 15:09.760
Marge:
<i>Bringing up a son,
even a blind one</i>

15:09.840 --> 15:11.480
isn't a lifetime occupation.

15:11.540 --> 15:15.580
Now the more you.. help him

15:15.640 --> 15:17.940
- Terrible.
- the more you hurt him.

15:18.510 --> 15:19.210
Hmmm.

15:20.450 --> 15:22.520
Congratulations, Artie.

15:22.580 --> 15:25.710
Marge, this may not be
the most appropriate forum

15:25.790 --> 15:28.130
for what I'm about to put forth

15:28.190 --> 15:31.330
but, ahem.. would you go
to the prom with me?

15:31.390 --> 15:32.950
Well...

15:33.030 --> 15:36.230
I can think of a dozen
highly cogent arguments.

15:36.300 --> 15:39.840
The first is from <i>Time Magazine.
Dated January 8th 1974.</i>

15:39.900 --> 15:41.410
"America's love affair
with the prom.

15:41.470 --> 15:44.110
"Even wallflowers
can look forward

15:44.170 --> 15:45.680
- <i>to one date a year..."
- No Artie, Artie...</i>

15:45.740 --> 15:47.010
The best argument

15:47.080 --> 15:50.050
is that I've known and
respected you for eight years

15:50.110 --> 15:52.350
and I would be delighted
to go to the prom with you.

15:55.920 --> 15:58.420
If you pinch your cheeks,
they'll glow.

15:58.490 --> 15:59.820
A little more.

15:59.890 --> 16:01.860
Try to break
some capillaries, dear.

16:01.920 --> 16:03.280
Couldn't we just use rouge
for this?

16:03.360 --> 16:04.530
Ladies pinch.

16:04.590 --> 16:06.650
Whores use rouge.

16:08.660 --> 16:09.920
Is Marge here?

16:10.000 --> 16:11.500
Who...

16:11.570 --> 16:12.800
or what
are you?

16:12.870 --> 16:13.640
I'm her date.

16:13.700 --> 16:14.840
Um-hum.
I suppose

16:14.900 --> 16:15.960
you want to come in
and sit down?

16:16.040 --> 16:16.540
Okay.

16:16.600 --> 16:17.700
Marge's dates

16:17.770 --> 16:19.100
get homelier all the time.

16:19.170 --> 16:21.240
That's what you get
when you don't put out.

16:23.780 --> 16:27.420
You know, I usually insist
on approving Marge's dates

16:27.480 --> 16:30.150
but from what she's told me,
I'm sure you're a solid citizen.

16:30.220 --> 16:30.820
Thanks,
Mr. B.

What are you doing here?

16:46.530 --> 16:48.930
You said you'd go
to the prom with me.

16:49.000 --> 16:51.030
I also said I hated you,

16:51.110 --> 16:53.610
and we haven't even
talked since then.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.450
I was afraid you'd
cancel our date,

16:55.510 --> 16:56.950
( <i>doorbell rings )
so I stayed away
from you completely</i>

16:57.010 --> 16:59.020
even though it meant
skipping school for three weeks

16:59.080 --> 17:02.290
and graduating this summer...
I hope.

17:02.350 --> 17:05.890
I'm Artie Ziff,

who are you?

17:18.329 --> 17:20.190
I'm... a spare.

Excuse me.

is behind us forever

take you home, huh?
