WEBVTT

00:03.090 --> 00:05.179
So my hormone levels are good?

00:05.266 --> 00:08.399
More than good.
They're outstanding, yes.

00:08.486 --> 00:11.489
My soil is ripe for the
planting, Farmer Mike.

00:11.576 --> 00:12.795
Who are you talking to?

00:12.882 --> 00:14.536
My doctor.
He got my test results.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.233
Oh, good, for a second there,
I thought I was getting

00:16.320 --> 00:18.366
roped into doing yard work.

00:18.453 --> 00:20.672
Oh, thank you, yes,
I'm gonna start pounding

00:20.759 --> 00:22.370
those prenatal vitamins.

00:22.457 --> 00:25.242
I'm gonna have babies coming
out of my ears.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.896
I know where
they actually come out of.

00:26.983 --> 00:29.290
The stork brings 'em, right?

00:29.377 --> 00:31.988
I'm kidding, I'm ki..
Hello?

00:33.642 --> 00:35.513
Why didn't you tell me
you went to the doctor?

00:35.600 --> 00:37.950
I did tell you, I told you
last week I had an appointment

00:38.038 --> 00:39.387
with my gynecologist.

00:39.474 --> 00:41.563
You know I always tune
you out at "gyn."

00:41.650 --> 00:43.086
Certain things I like kept
a mystery.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.827
Your lady business
is one of them.

00:44.914 --> 00:47.656
And how they make pickle
and pimiento loaf is the other.

00:47.743 --> 00:50.441
Well, I'm glad
I made the variety pack.

00:50.528 --> 00:52.182
So, are you worried
or something?

00:52.269 --> 00:54.097
'Cause you said getting pregnant
could take up to a year.

00:54.184 --> 00:56.665
No, it can, I just wanted
confirmation that I'm healthy

00:56.752 --> 00:59.885
and not sending your troops
on a kamikaze mission.

00:59.972 --> 01:02.453
[doorbell ringing]
Cut the metaphors,
let's talk like adults.

01:02.540 --> 01:04.020
Is there something wrong
with my pee-pee?

01:06.805 --> 01:08.503
Good evening, madam.

01:08.590 --> 01:12.376
- Are you the lady of the house?
- Come on, Mike, you know me.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.552
I like to be thorough
and ahead of the game.

01:14.639 --> 01:17.425
[doorbell rings]

01:17.512 --> 01:18.948
Vince, do you mind?

01:19.035 --> 01:20.689
Mike and I are trying to
have a serious conversation.

01:20.776 --> 01:22.865
What is more serious
than a house

01:22.952 --> 01:25.650
full of dirt and dust mites?

01:25.737 --> 01:27.391
Dare I say nothing?

01:27.478 --> 01:29.915
And even though your house
appears to be clean

01:30.002 --> 01:32.831
to the naked eye,
trust me when I tell you

01:32.918 --> 01:34.877
you are living in filth.

01:34.964 --> 01:38.402
Good evening, sir.
You have a lovely home.

01:38.489 --> 01:39.795
What the hell is he doing?

01:39.882 --> 01:42.406
He got a part-time job
selling vacuum cleaners.

01:42.493 --> 01:45.583
Not just any vacuum cleaner,
this is the Cutlass Supreme

01:45.670 --> 01:47.933
of all in one
home cleaning devices.

01:49.283 --> 01:51.850
Seriously,
I was more worried about me.

01:51.937 --> 01:54.331
As a kid I used to ride my bike
over the railroad tracks.

01:54.418 --> 01:55.941
I wanted to make sure
nothing got rattled loose.

01:56.028 --> 01:57.552
Hey, I rode a boy's bike.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.162
You know how many times
I bounced off that seat

01:59.249 --> 02:00.946
and gave myself
a seven-ten split?

02:02.861 --> 02:04.036
If you're really
worried about it

02:04.124 --> 02:05.734
why don't you get
tested like I did?

02:05.821 --> 02:07.649
Easy for you,
you just got to lay back

02:07.736 --> 02:09.825
put your feet up, and thumb
through good housekeeping.

02:09.912 --> 02:11.566
Mike, that's a pedicure.

02:11.653 --> 02:14.134
You really don't know how
the pickle loaf is made.

02:14.221 --> 02:17.093
Hey, where are you going? I'm
not done with my demonstration.

02:17.180 --> 02:19.965
Yeah, you're doing great. Do the
steps, then leave me a brochure.

02:21.532 --> 02:25.754
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

02:27.016 --> 02:30.150
♪ I see love ♪♪

02:43.598 --> 02:45.600
Women, they tell you
everything's fine, next thing

02:45.687 --> 02:47.993
you know, they're pointing an
accusing finger at your crotch.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.866
Well, I understand
Molly's concern.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.085
You're over 35, you sit on your
big behind all day

02:53.173 --> 02:55.479
and with a cell phone
in your front pocket.

02:55.566 --> 02:58.003
That radiation is wreaking
havoc on your precious cargo.

02:59.440 --> 03:00.876
Man, you might as well
just put your junk

03:00.963 --> 03:02.399
in a microwave
and hit the popcorn button.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.404
If that were really true, they'd
put a warning label on a phone.

03:07.491 --> 03:08.753
Mm, like a little sticker
with two balls

03:08.840 --> 03:09.798
and a red line through it?

03:11.930 --> 03:13.062
Government don't care
about your scrotum

03:13.149 --> 03:14.803
they just want your money.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.761
Everything's a
conspiracy with you.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.937
It's all around you,
you just got to open your eyes

03:19.024 --> 03:20.330
and don't get me started
about microwave ovens.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.027
Here we go.

03:22.114 --> 03:23.333
How much time do you spend

03:23.420 --> 03:24.465
standing in front of
one of those things?

03:24.552 --> 03:26.336
Until it dings, Ralph Nader.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.426
Two minutes, four times a day.

03:29.513 --> 03:33.169
Breakfast burrito, lunch
burrito, pre-dinner burrito.

03:33.256 --> 03:34.736
I mean, you got to ask yourself,
do you want a baby

03:34.823 --> 03:37.217
or another burrito?

03:37.304 --> 03:38.870
Hey, you know I want
to have a kid.

03:38.957 --> 03:40.568
That's why Molly and I have
been trying so hard.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.744
Well, then you need to take
better care of your spermatozoa.

03:42.831 --> 03:44.224
Start showing it
the same love and concern

03:44.311 --> 03:46.487
you give a bag of M&M's.

03:46.574 --> 03:48.140
Maybe I could get
one of those lead bibs

03:48.228 --> 03:50.621
from the dentist's office
and make a diaper out of it.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.276
Hah! You joke, but that's the
way you need to be thinking.

03:53.363 --> 03:55.278
In the meantime, you should just
go get your sperm tested.

03:55.365 --> 03:57.454
Find out how many koi
you got swimming in your pond.

03:59.326 --> 04:01.806
Oh, no, I'm not going to sit
in a cold, sterile room

04:01.893 --> 04:03.243
with a plastic cup in one hand

04:03.330 --> 04:04.766
and an old porn magazine
in the other.

04:04.853 --> 04:06.158
Unless you have a third hand

04:06.246 --> 04:08.552
you're going to be there
a very long time.

04:11.642 --> 04:15.385
Plus, they've updated the porn.
There's Asian, German, French.

04:15.472 --> 04:16.734
It's like going through
It's a Small World

04:16.821 --> 04:18.780
except all the puppets
are humping each other.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.915
Hang on a second. You mean
you've actually donated sperm?

04:24.002 --> 04:26.004
Hey, there are a lot of
childless couples out there.

04:26.091 --> 04:30.095
It'd be a crime not to share
this genetic treasure chest.

04:30.182 --> 04:31.227
And they pay you to do that?

04:31.314 --> 04:33.055
75 bucks a pop.

04:33.142 --> 04:35.231
That's how I paid
for the snow tires on my Blazer.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.713
Oh, my God.

04:40.323 --> 04:42.107
I'm sitting on a gold mine.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.416
And to think how much money
has already slipped

04:46.503 --> 04:48.026
through my fingers.

04:50.377 --> 04:51.856
Alright, I'm done eating.

04:55.773 --> 04:58.515
Alright, another bottle
of Chardonnay for the ladies

04:58.602 --> 05:01.257
and one fertility smoothie
for the mommy to be.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.085
Hand over the Chardonnay.

05:03.172 --> 05:05.870
No more kids for me.

05:05.957 --> 05:08.395
Yeah, it's a smoothie, mom,
not a time machine.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.530
Well, if it was,
first thing I'd do is go back

05:13.617 --> 05:16.751
and get my pre baby knockers.

05:16.838 --> 05:19.362
Boy, you girls sure left
those things for dead.

05:22.278 --> 05:26.326
Well, I'm sorry that we were
hungry and needed to live.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.546
And most of that's on Molly.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.156
You know, those kegs were
pretty well tapped

05:31.243 --> 05:32.897
by the time I hit the party.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.512
Back in the day,
these beauties could stop

05:38.599 --> 05:40.818
a whole high school
track team.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.385
And that was just
flopping out one of them.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.215
Well, I'm sorry being our
mother was such a burden.

05:46.302 --> 05:48.348
Well, what's done is done.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.308
Why are you drinking
that green sludge anyway?

05:52.395 --> 05:53.788
Yeah, you said you
were dropping eggs

05:53.875 --> 05:55.180
like a blind
chicken farmer.

05:55.267 --> 05:57.095
I'm just keeping
my uterus fresh.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.488
It's just like doing, you know

05:58.575 --> 06:00.534
those crossword
puzzles for the brain.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.797
Well, if you're fine,
it's probably the hubby.

06:02.884 --> 06:04.842
He sits in front
of that microwave

06:04.929 --> 06:07.279
like it's a television.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.977
There's nothing wrong
with me or Mike.

06:09.064 --> 06:11.414
It's just taking a little
longer than we expected.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.503
Well, maybe his sperm
would have an easier time

06:13.590 --> 06:14.939
finding your egg
if it came with a side

06:15.026 --> 06:16.114
of bacon and hash browns.

06:16.201 --> 06:17.507
Mom.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.947
Hey, Vin,
how'd it go out there?

06:23.034 --> 06:25.602
I hate people.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.823
They're stupid
and they live like animals.

06:28.910 --> 06:32.043
I got enough hair in my roller
to open a wig store.

06:32.130 --> 06:34.959
Good, so you do have something
to fall back on.

06:37.005 --> 06:40.487
Don't start with me, young lady.
I'm in no mood for your sass.

06:40.574 --> 06:42.445
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:42.532 --> 06:44.752
What's your stand on back talk
or horseplay?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.625
You spoiled these brats.

06:48.712 --> 06:51.019
Why are you killing
yourself like this, huh?

06:51.106 --> 06:54.675
I told you, between my
pension and social security

06:54.762 --> 06:56.328
we're gonna be fine.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.897
Hey, I will make my own
money and pay my own way.

06:59.984 --> 07:02.204
Vincent Moranto
is not a man whore.

07:04.336 --> 07:06.556
Good, because that's
a living room demonstration

07:06.643 --> 07:08.732
that no one needs to see.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.738
And to think,
after my first sale

07:14.825 --> 07:17.219
I was going to start giving
you girls an allowance.

07:18.786 --> 07:23.225
-No more.
-Okay, well, hang on a minute.

07:23.312 --> 07:25.749
I was just kidding around,
you know.

07:25.836 --> 07:28.448
How much are we talking about,
step pappy?

07:30.188 --> 07:31.886
He's so sensitive.

07:34.628 --> 07:38.501
Eight, nine, ten.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.329
Hey, what is
going on down here?

07:40.416 --> 07:44.638
You looking to be Mr. January
in the policemen's calendar?

07:44.725 --> 07:46.683
I just read that keeping
my blood flowing

07:46.770 --> 07:49.599
decreases stress and
increases sperm production.

07:49.686 --> 07:51.427
Wow, working out and reading.

07:51.514 --> 07:53.429
Hello, handsome,
my name's Molly.

07:55.649 --> 07:57.128
I stopped by
the library to peruse

07:57.215 --> 07:59.000
a couple of books
on male fertility.

07:59.087 --> 08:01.306
The ones that hadn't been
defaced by teenage perverts

08:01.393 --> 08:03.700
were actually very helpful.

08:03.787 --> 08:06.573
You should see what those kids
do to my health books at school.

08:06.660 --> 08:08.183
They'll add hair to anything.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.534
Anyway, it was very informative.

08:11.621 --> 08:13.362
I had no idea
how important sperm is

08:13.449 --> 08:14.842
to the reproductive process.

08:17.714 --> 08:21.544
Maybe you should've gone
to the library a little sooner.

08:21.631 --> 08:23.198
Did you know the shape
of the male sperm

08:23.285 --> 08:24.939
can actually
determine its value?

08:25.026 --> 08:26.854
No, I thought they all came
pretty much the same shape

08:26.941 --> 08:29.378
like, uh, like Peeps.

08:29.465 --> 08:31.467
No, golly, no,
some are better than others.

08:31.554 --> 08:34.383
The optimal sperm has an oval
head, a slender midsection

08:34.470 --> 08:36.428
and a tail that moves
in a wavelike motion.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.170
Oh, I had an uncle like that.
He was in the Ice Capades.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.434
They are little athletes.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.871
You got to feed 'em right
and keep 'em fit

08:43.958 --> 08:45.829
so they'll be ready
for the big game.

08:45.916 --> 08:48.789
Oh, so, what time's
kick off, coach?

08:48.876 --> 08:50.399
Sorry, ma'am, no game tonight.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.357
All the books say abstaining
for a couple of days

08:52.444 --> 08:54.969
builds up your sperm count
and increases your odds

08:55.056 --> 08:56.361
of fertilization.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.625
Real nice, you get a lady
all hot and bothered

08:58.712 --> 09:00.757
you're making muscles
and reading books.

09:00.844 --> 09:03.804
You're a tease, mister.

09:03.891 --> 09:06.241
If you can't control yourself,
you better get out of here

09:06.328 --> 09:09.418
'cause I can't do my curls
and fight you off.

09:09.505 --> 09:12.769
One, two, three.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.163
Oh, yeah, guns a-blazing.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.475
Oh, what time is it?

09:23.563 --> 09:24.868
After midnight.

09:24.955 --> 09:26.653
You been down there
lifting weights all night?

09:26.740 --> 09:28.089
No, I fell asleep
on the bench.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.181
Well, at least it wasn't
on the toilet this time.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.750
Scared the hell out of me
when I turned on that light.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.190
I don't know what it is about
reading, it just knocks me out.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.975
Rough day out there today?

09:45.062 --> 09:46.629
I got more doors
slammed in my face

09:46.716 --> 09:49.110
than a Jehovah's Witness
with a cold sore.

09:52.026 --> 09:53.723
So you didn't
make one sale?

09:53.810 --> 09:56.334
Negative, if you're standing
in front of a peephole

09:56.421 --> 09:58.554
carrying a vacuum,
you might as well be wearing

09:58.641 --> 10:01.905
a hockey mask, holding a
machete and a severed head.

10:04.386 --> 10:06.823
Well, no offense, but
you can't blame the vacuum

10:06.910 --> 10:09.173
for all of that, you're not
exactly a people person.

10:09.260 --> 10:14.265
What are you talking about,
you big load? I'm beloved.

10:14.352 --> 10:17.660
You're right. Hey, can I buy one
of those vacuum cleaners of you?

10:17.747 --> 10:21.055
- Really?
- No. You called me a big load.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.752
That's mean.

10:22.839 --> 10:26.321
Don't take it out on me because
your grapes are seedless.

10:28.192 --> 10:29.237
You don't know what
you're talking about.

10:29.324 --> 10:30.586
These things take time.

10:30.673 --> 10:32.109
Take all the time
in the world.

10:32.196 --> 10:33.850
You can't fight genetics.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.418
You're the only son
of an only son.

10:36.505 --> 10:39.421
That's not a family tree,
that's a stump.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.904
The Biggs don't
procreate out of love

10:43.991 --> 10:45.383
we do it because we need
someone to mow the lawn

10:45.470 --> 10:46.820
or get the paper.

10:46.907 --> 10:48.604
Well, you can ignore
the facts all you want

10:48.691 --> 10:51.259
but I'm guessing there's
a goofy chromosome somewhere.

10:53.130 --> 10:55.002
I did have an uncle
with alopecia.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.961
Yikes, that no hair thing?

10:58.048 --> 10:59.746
Not a one.
Great guy though.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.095
He used to give
me sips of beer

11:01.182 --> 11:03.140
and let me draw on his
eyebrows with a Sharpie.

11:04.533 --> 11:06.056
See, you never know.

11:06.143 --> 11:09.277
I actually found out
there was an albino Moranto.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.932
Saw him at a family reunion,
I thought it was my ghost.

11:17.459 --> 11:20.201
Pigs in a blanket, right out
of the oven and piping hot.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.811
Let 'em cool this time.

11:21.898 --> 11:24.509
I'm not buttering the top
of your mouth again.

11:24.596 --> 11:26.511
I'd better not, mom,
Molly and I are eating healthier

11:26.598 --> 11:28.252
now that we're trying
to have a baby.

11:28.339 --> 11:31.429
Oh, princess trying
to sour you on weenies, huh?

11:31.516 --> 11:32.604
Good luck with that.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.607
You used to teethe
on a frozen one.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.740
Maybe that's why I was
the only two year old with gout.

11:37.827 --> 11:41.135
I just assumed
you weren't a walker.

11:41.222 --> 11:44.007
While we're on the subject
of gouty babies

11:44.094 --> 11:46.575
did you and dad have
any trouble conceiving me?

11:46.662 --> 11:48.229
Oh, it took a while.

11:48.316 --> 11:52.755
Your old man had a hair trigger,
but his bullets meandered.

11:52.842 --> 11:54.844
Is that why you didn't
have another kid?

11:54.931 --> 11:56.498
Yeah, and I wanted
a little girl

11:56.585 --> 11:58.369
but I couldn't go
through all that again.

11:58.456 --> 11:59.675
It was easier just
to throw a dress

11:59.762 --> 12:01.285
on you every once in a while.

12:01.372 --> 12:04.506
Thank you for that.
Molly loves those pictures.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.856
You showed up just
in the nick of time too.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.466
I was packed and ready to leave

12:08.553 --> 12:11.643
and then that son of a bitch
finally delivered.

12:13.776 --> 12:14.908
So, if you hadn't
gotten pregnant

12:14.995 --> 12:16.431
you were gonna leave him?

12:16.518 --> 12:20.478
Well, my mothering instincts
are marrow deep

12:20.565 --> 12:23.481
and to deny a child that
precious love would be criminal.

12:23.568 --> 12:25.048
Yeah.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.442
And if your old man
hadn't knocked me up

12:27.529 --> 12:29.661
I'd have found another
gin soaked bastard who could.

12:32.882 --> 12:36.059
You look peaked, for God's sake
eat a weenie before you faint.

12:41.848 --> 12:42.762
[instrumental music]

12:51.945 --> 12:53.337
What the hell is rubella?

12:53.424 --> 12:56.514
I think it's a chocolate
hazelnut spread.

12:56.601 --> 12:58.778
- No, that's Nutella.
- Oh.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.431
Good, 'cause if that's the list
of food you like

13:00.518 --> 13:02.999
you're gonna be here forever.

13:03.086 --> 13:05.262
They want my entire
medical history.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.829
Just say no to everything,
otherwise they are gonna

13:06.916 --> 13:08.526
put you in the strange
mailing list.

13:08.613 --> 13:11.051
You end up getting
a rubella monthly.

13:11.138 --> 13:14.532
No, rubella. No, diphtheria,
no, typhoid.

13:14.619 --> 13:17.274
By the way, I bought you some
erotic literature.

13:17.361 --> 13:19.146
Help you stimulate the sexy.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.931
You didn't put anything
weird in here, did you?

13:22.018 --> 13:22.932
Well, define weird.

13:23.933 --> 13:25.543
Anything you would like.

13:25.630 --> 13:27.676
Oh, God. I gave you a nice
wholesome variety.

13:27.763 --> 13:29.547
You know, meat potatoes.

13:29.634 --> 13:32.376
In fact, that thing doesn't
want you calling meat potatoes.

13:32.463 --> 13:35.771
Naughty nurses, ride 'em
cowgirls, Asian antiques??

13:35.858 --> 13:39.209
and old car new boobs,
I can make these work.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.213
Now, just remember,
while you're in there

13:43.300 --> 13:44.649
keep a positive attitude.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.260
What are you talking about?

13:46.347 --> 13:48.479
A man's sperm can be
affected by many things

13:48.566 --> 13:51.004
not just asparagus
and pineapple, okay?

13:51.091 --> 13:54.007
Stress is also a factor.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I am a little worried.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.575
I mean, what if I can't
give Molly a kid?

13:57.662 --> 13:59.621
See, man, don't lay all that
on your sperm's tiny head.

13:59.708 --> 14:02.232
You got 'em panicking. They're
swimming around in circles.

14:02.319 --> 14:03.712
Seriously, Carl, I mean

14:03.799 --> 14:05.148
she's been talking
about kids since I met her.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.280
What if this is
a deal breaker?

14:06.367 --> 14:09.022
No, stop it.
Stay positive.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.719
Set an example for your
little white army.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.549
Alright, let's do this.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.334
Hey, you're gonna give
Molly a beautiful baby.

14:17.421 --> 14:19.075
Just keep your eye
on the prize.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.773
A-and don't skip over page 14
in Old Cars, New Boobs.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.864
It's an ad for penis enlargers,
but i-i-it's hot as hell.

14:27.388 --> 14:29.042
- Okay, wish me luck.
- Yeah.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.173
I'd hug you, but I don't want
that in my head.

14:30.260 --> 14:32.523
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:32.610 --> 14:35.744
Break a leg, Mike.

14:35.831 --> 14:38.790
Cha-ching. And here's my share
of the cable bill, Carl.

14:40.227 --> 14:41.750
Don't give it to me,
cash it in.

14:41.837 --> 14:44.492
This is great.
Easy money.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.450
It's like an ATM
that accepts penises.

14:52.282 --> 14:55.024
Can I go now?
I'm gonna miss my bus.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.983
Well, you should've thought
of that before you made

14:57.070 --> 14:59.072
that disgusting sound
when I bent over

14:59.159 --> 15:01.248
and picked up the eraser.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.076
Everybody else thought
it was funny.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.991
You know what they're gonna
think is really funny?

15:05.078 --> 15:08.168
You being held back a grade.

15:08.255 --> 15:11.084
You can't prove that that noise
didn't come out of you.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.260
You realize that there are
no witnesses here, right?

15:13.347 --> 15:16.176
Your family is gonna believe
whatever I tell them.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.963
I thought I saw your car
in the parking lot.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.617
Got you guarding
the reprobates, huh?

15:22.704 --> 15:24.749
Oh, just a little
after school detention

15:24.836 --> 15:26.882
for a rather
inappropriate young boy.

15:26.969 --> 15:28.449
I know this one.

15:28.536 --> 15:32.148
What'd you do now,
Two Milk Marvin?

15:32.235 --> 15:35.021
Disrupted my class
by making an obscene noise.

15:35.108 --> 15:37.762
Bronx cheer when you bend over
to pick something up?

15:37.849 --> 15:42.158
Did the same thing to me
when I dropped my soup ladle.

15:42.245 --> 15:44.682
He's gonna learn to behave
more like a gentleman.

15:44.769 --> 15:45.814
Good luck with that.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.294
By the placement of his eyes

15:47.381 --> 15:48.948
I'm guessing it's
Fetal Alcohol Syndrome.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.777
- Your mama a drinker?
- Oh, my God.

15:52.864 --> 15:54.910
Okay, Mark, go catch your bus.

15:56.085 --> 15:57.782
Lesson learned.

15:57.869 --> 15:59.001
That ought to scare
him straight.

15:59.088 --> 16:01.525
That actually spooked me
a little bit.

16:01.612 --> 16:04.093
I'm not a Mollycoddler.
Here you go.

16:04.180 --> 16:07.227
- My knock 'em up chowder.
- Wait, what is this?

16:07.314 --> 16:10.491
Listen, slow sperm runs
in the Biggs family.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.232
They get there eventually,
you just got to give them

16:12.319 --> 16:13.494
a little boot
in the pooper.

16:15.235 --> 16:17.019
Wait, Mike talked to you?

16:17.106 --> 16:19.543
He's worried sick
he can't give you a baby

16:19.630 --> 16:21.893
and he thinks that you'll
dump him if he doesn't.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.417
What? Who told him that?

16:23.504 --> 16:25.375
I have no idea.

16:27.508 --> 16:29.901
But even if his swimmers
are floundering around

16:29.989 --> 16:32.165
there's things you can do
to help prime the pump.

16:32.252 --> 16:34.384
Okay, I do not
feel comfortable

16:34.471 --> 16:38.258
talking about Mike's pump
or how I prime it.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.911
Cut out the fancy positions?

16:39.999 --> 16:41.348
Missionaries know a lot more

16:41.435 --> 16:43.306
than just how to get
Bibles to savages.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.134
Okay, I'm grading some papers.

16:45.221 --> 16:47.180
We're talking flat backed,
spread eagled

16:47.267 --> 16:50.270
pretending he's Magnum, P.I.,
or whoever floats your boat.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.403
Okay. Thanks for the soup.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.927
Uh, I'll enjoy it
as soon as I..

16:56.015 --> 16:58.365
...think I can hold it down.

16:58.452 --> 17:00.106
It's not for you,
it's for him.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.759
Add some cayenne
and Worcestershire.

17:01.846 --> 17:03.283
He'll balk at the taste

17:03.370 --> 17:05.198
but you'll get the pounding
of a lifetime.

17:10.072 --> 17:11.769
[cell phone rings]

17:14.555 --> 17:16.774
Aw, man, I fell asleep again.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.602
I am done with reading.

17:20.387 --> 17:21.866
Hey, Molly, what's going on?

17:21.953 --> 17:23.955
Nothing, I just wanted
to check in with you

17:24.043 --> 17:25.914
and tell you that I loved you.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.611
[Mike]
'Aw, I love you too.'

17:27.698 --> 17:30.658
And no matter what happens,
I'm never gonna stop loving you.

17:30.745 --> 17:33.487
Whether we have a baby
or we don't have a baby.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.010
Yeah, but I know
how much you want one

17:35.097 --> 17:36.664
and I don't want you
to be disappointed.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.666
Sweetie, it's not
about having a baby

17:38.753 --> 17:42.017
it's about having
a baby with you.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.237
What if I can't
give you that?

17:44.324 --> 17:45.629
Then we'll deal
with that then.

17:45.716 --> 17:47.588
I mean, there are
a lot of options

17:47.675 --> 17:50.069
none of which include
me walking away

17:50.156 --> 17:53.072
from the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:53.159 --> 17:54.421
You mean me?

17:55.422 --> 17:57.598
Of course, I mean you.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.382
'My big, sexy policeman.'

18:01.210 --> 18:03.038
Go on.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.518
And tonight, when you get home

18:04.605 --> 18:07.347
I'm gonna show you
how much I love you.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.131
Well, what would you do first?

18:11.394 --> 18:12.917
What, you mean when I get home?

18:13.004 --> 18:15.181
Probably hang up my purse
like I always do.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.532
No, I mean,
what would you do to me?

18:21.187 --> 18:24.190
Are you trying
to get me to have phone sex?

18:24.277 --> 18:25.974
Where are you?

18:26.061 --> 18:28.455
I'm at the sperm clinic
with an empty cup in my hand

18:28.542 --> 18:30.718
and two friends outside the door
making kissing noises.

18:31.893 --> 18:33.416
Alright, let me lock the door.

18:33.503 --> 18:35.026
I don't want your mom
walking in here again.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.550
Aw, why'd you have
to bring her up?

18:36.637 --> 18:39.118
Now we're gonna
have to start all over.

18:39.205 --> 18:40.858
What are you wearing?

18:48.562 --> 18:51.652
A hundred and fifty million
just in that little cup?

18:51.739 --> 18:53.262
Hundred and fifty million.

18:53.349 --> 18:57.179
We're rich.
We're sperm millionaires.

18:57.266 --> 19:00.313
A-and they're healthy
and shaped right? Oval heads?

19:00.400 --> 19:02.663
- Big, oval heads.
- Just like daddy.

19:04.447 --> 19:06.754
Thank you, doctor.

19:06.841 --> 19:10.410
What? I should have sex
with my wife right now?

19:10.497 --> 19:13.848
Yes, sir, I'll do it two times
and call you in the morning.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.375
You heard the doctor.

19:19.462 --> 19:21.377
He didn't say that,
you already hung up.

19:21.464 --> 19:23.771
I know. I lied.
I'm a very bad boy.

19:25.468 --> 19:27.296
- Alright, get upstairs.
- Yes, teacher.
