WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:03.127
Kelly, I'm so
sorry about Shay.

00:03.212 --> 00:04.462
She was my best friend.

00:04.546 --> 00:05.546
I know.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.298
You went to see your
father's family?

00:07.383 --> 00:08.966
These are not people
that you wanna know.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.259
I want to know.

00:10.761 --> 00:11.761
How's what's-her-name
doing?

00:12.179 --> 00:14.180
Dawson? You be sure
to send her our love.

00:14.264 --> 00:15.306
Truck 81...

00:15.391 --> 00:16.724
First truck on the
scene's in charge!

00:16.809 --> 00:17.850
Go! Go!

00:17.935 --> 00:19.268
Do not wanna get there
behind these guys.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.187
There's nothing
personal about this,

00:21.271 --> 00:23.189
but 105 has filled
their candidate slot.

00:24.108 --> 00:27.068
I feel responsible.
I asked you to stay
at 51 longer...

00:27.444 --> 00:30.530
The truth is, Welch was
never gonna let another
woman in that slot.

00:37.371 --> 00:38.830
Hey, Chief.
What's up?

00:39.164 --> 00:40.331
Casey.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.584
I know how we can get
Dawson on the truck.

00:45.254 --> 00:46.295
You're sure about this?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.630
Answer the question.

00:48.132 --> 00:50.216
Do you think
it's a good fit?
Are you kidding?

00:51.135 --> 00:53.219
Gabby is gonna be
one hell of a firefighter.

00:53.303 --> 00:55.346
No doubt,
but you know
what I'm after.

00:55.431 --> 00:57.223
Can the two of you
separate your
personal feelings

00:57.307 --> 00:59.016
from your professional
responsibilities?

00:59.643 --> 01:02.770
Are you really prepared
to overlook the fact
that she and I...

01:02.855 --> 01:05.523
I'm not required to know
all the details of
your personal lives.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.569
It is only strictly prohibited
if you were married,

01:09.820 --> 01:10.987
which you are not.

01:12.489 --> 01:15.783
So, you take some time,
you mull it over.

01:17.327 --> 01:18.745
Decision's
in your hands.

01:25.919 --> 01:27.211
All right, boys.

01:28.338 --> 01:29.464
Feast your eyes.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.424
- Not bad, not bad.
- Huh.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.259
Yeah, it was
an old burger truck,

01:33.343 --> 01:34.969
so it's already got
most of the equipment
we need.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.638
Look.
Fryer, gas grill,
refrigeration.

01:37.723 --> 01:40.516
"Built-in napkin
dispensers." Snazzy.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.684
Mmm-hmm.

01:41.769 --> 01:43.060
Can't you just picture

01:43.437 --> 01:44.729
our logo
on the side of that thing?

01:45.355 --> 01:46.731
Molly's Two.

01:47.191 --> 01:48.316
Cruz, how much
this thing cost?

01:48.400 --> 01:50.151
That's the best part,
it's only 12 grand!

01:50.277 --> 01:51.861
That's not possible.
Give me
the phone number.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.488
Joe, where does it
say $12,000?

01:53.572 --> 01:56.073
Right there! 12K.

01:56.325 --> 01:57.867
That's 12,000 miles.

01:59.161 --> 02:00.203
The price is...

02:00.996 --> 02:03.039
$79,000.

02:03.123 --> 02:07.251
So, before you pitched
Herrmann this great idea,

02:07.336 --> 02:09.212
did you do
any research,

02:10.047 --> 02:11.839
at all,
on how much it costs

02:11.924 --> 02:13.132
to get a food truck
up and running?

02:13.217 --> 02:14.675
The vehicle, the license,
the registration...

02:14.760 --> 02:16.803
All right, all right!
I get it, Mouch.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.222
You wanna point fingers,
or you wanna help me
find a truck?

02:20.682 --> 02:24.268
Engine 51, Truck 81,
Squad 3, Ambulance 61.

02:24.353 --> 02:26.103
Structure fire,
16th and Wabash.

02:33.779 --> 02:35.822
I can already
see the smoke, boys!

02:35.906 --> 02:37.490
Looks like it's rolling.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.578
Oh, boy!
Hey, Casey!

02:42.663 --> 02:45.373
We're neck-and-neck
with your old pal Welch!

02:48.252 --> 02:50.378
Don't worry, Casey!
I got this!

02:50.462 --> 02:52.713
I'm not interested
in a pissing contest.

02:52.798 --> 02:54.924
If Welch wants this fire,
he can have it.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.513
Cruz, forget him.
Just drive the truck.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.976
Great. Welch is gonna
get there first.

03:05.060 --> 03:06.519
We'll be taking orders
from him.

03:10.399 --> 03:13.484
Ah, I don't see 'em.
Maybe they got held up.

03:13.569 --> 03:14.944
See?

03:15.487 --> 03:16.737
It all works out
in the end.

03:59.156 --> 04:00.656
Whoa! Severide!

04:01.033 --> 04:03.576
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Squad 3 to Main!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.203
Truck 81, Truck 66
have collided

04:06.288 --> 04:08.414
on the corner of
24th and Wabash!

04:08.874 --> 04:12.126
Gonna need ambulances,
as many as you can get!

04:12.210 --> 04:14.170
This is bad!

04:15.047 --> 04:16.088
Oh, Dawson,

04:16.173 --> 04:18.049
that's, like,
five blocks back.
What do we do?

04:18.133 --> 04:21.052
This is 61 to Main.
We're closer to the accident
than we are the fire.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.345
You want us to take
the accident instead?

04:22.679 --> 04:24.013
Stand by, 61.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.933
Should I keep driving?

04:27.184 --> 04:29.018
Affirmative, 61.
Take in the accident.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.269
Okay. Turn around!
Go, go, go, go, go!

04:36.401 --> 04:38.778
Confirming that Truck 81
and 66 are out of action.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.322
Requesting that
Squad 3 stay.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
Please reassign other
units to structure fire.

04:43.575 --> 04:45.701
Mills, Capp, Tony,
check 66!
Okay.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.787
Newhouse, you're with me!
Right.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.084
You guys all right?
Any injuries?

04:53.168 --> 04:54.710
Case! You okay?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.545
Mouch is hurt.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.756
Oh, hell.
This is bad.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.009
Otis, you okay?

05:02.052 --> 05:03.886
Yeah, but Mouch
is bleeding.

05:05.389 --> 05:07.556
- Mouch, talk to me.
- It's my eye.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.809
It hit something.
Door frame?
I don't know.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.268
Let me see, bud.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.020
All right. Don't worry,
we're gonna take care of you.

05:13.105 --> 05:14.814
Herrmann, grab
your jump bag.

05:14.940 --> 05:18.192
Newhouse, go down
and put pressure on that.
Copy.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.158
Cruz. You okay?

05:26.243 --> 05:27.243
Cruz!

05:27.327 --> 05:28.536
Huh?

05:28.620 --> 05:30.037
We'll get you out.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.126
What do we got?
We got a whole
lot of injuries.

05:35.210 --> 05:37.044
Driver's not responding.
He's pinned in there
pretty bad.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.798
Hey, Welch,
what's his name?

05:40.882 --> 05:43.426
Welch!
Molina.

05:43.635 --> 05:44.927
Hey, Molina!
Can you hear me, bud?

05:45.053 --> 05:46.637
Tell me he's okay.
He's okay?
I can't find a pulse.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.180
Can you reach in there?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.850
Okay, I feel
somethin', barely.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.143
We gotta get him
out of here!

06:03.780 --> 06:05.197
All right, easy man.
I got it.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.282
Don't worry about me.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.658
Parish has got a busted leg,

06:07.743 --> 06:09.368
the bone is showing
and everything.

06:09.453 --> 06:10.911
I'll take care of him,
okay?
Take a seat over here.

06:10.996 --> 06:12.872
Why don't you guys
learn how to drive?

06:13.123 --> 06:14.874
I mean, damn, Lieutenant.
What the hell?

06:14.958 --> 06:16.042
Let's get out
of the way.
I'm not going anywhere.

06:16.126 --> 06:19.628
Seriously, you're
looking a little pale.
Come on, take a seat.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.053
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.679
Hey, hey, hey.
I'm fine.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.639
Hey! Slow down.
I'm fine.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.185
Parish, hang in there!
Parish!

06:41.735 --> 06:43.486
Hey, Gabby! Hey.
Matt!

06:43.653 --> 06:46.739
I'm okay, but we got
a lot of guys who need help.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.408
He's got a possible broken
arm, multiple lacerations.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.868
Guy in the back
has a broken leg.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.537
Driver's unconscious,
in real bad shape.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.040
Mouch got banged up.
Okay, I'll go
check on Mouch.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.124
All right.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.293
Hey, McFarland, you okay?

06:59.377 --> 07:00.419
Yeah.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.926
Mouch, what happened?

07:08.011 --> 07:09.804
Let me have a look.

07:09.888 --> 07:13.057
I can't see.
Aw, jeez, I can't see.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.976
I don't know what happened.
They came out of nowhere.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.604
Cruz, are you okay?
Why don't you sit?

07:24.528 --> 07:26.153
Put me to work, Lieutenant.

07:26.238 --> 07:28.239
Grab a side.

07:28.824 --> 07:31.492
What about the fire?
They're dispatching
more companies.

07:31.576 --> 07:33.035
Don't worry about the fire.

07:36.164 --> 07:39.125
- We got you, Parish.
- You're gonna be okay.

07:43.213 --> 07:45.631
Hey! Nice driving, genius.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.842
Hey, man, I...
Hey! Cruz.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.344
Now's not the time.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.397
Come on, buddy.

08:02.732 --> 08:04.692
You got room for one more?

08:06.361 --> 08:08.654
Oh, my God!

08:08.738 --> 08:09.864
I know, I know.

08:09.948 --> 08:11.490
What happened?

08:11.575 --> 08:13.951
Oh, it's real simple.
81 blew the light.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.370
We did not blow the light.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.580
Oh, yeah? Which way
does your seat face?

08:18.707 --> 08:21.375
Backwards, but...
Yeah, so you don't
really know, do you?

08:29.551 --> 08:31.427
Casey.
Yeah?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.387
Are your men okay?

08:33.471 --> 08:35.389
All but Mouch.
His eye's messed up.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.349
Dawson's taking
him to Chicago Med.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.185
Is it serious?
I don't know.

08:39.269 --> 08:42.688
He's alive, he's in one piece,
I'm just thankful for that.

08:42.856 --> 08:44.690
- What about Molina?
- He's non-responsive.

08:44.774 --> 08:46.692
Losing blood.
His legs are crushed.

08:46.776 --> 08:47.902
Cruz!

08:49.279 --> 08:51.780
What happened?
I don't know, Chief.
They came out of nowhere.

08:51.865 --> 08:53.490
Who had the light?
We did.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.868
You sure?
If it wasn't green,
then it was yellow.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.036
There's no way it was red.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.871
You don't know
what color it was?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.039
Cruz, did you
see the light?

09:00.207 --> 09:01.540
I must've.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.002
I know I did.
Chief, it just all
happened like that!

09:07.380 --> 09:08.797
Watch his arm!
You're too close!

09:09.049 --> 09:10.633
I see his arm,
I got it.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.718
All right, Mills, go ahead!

09:13.929 --> 09:15.262
Mills!

09:15.764 --> 09:17.932
Mills! Hey! Mills!

09:18.475 --> 09:20.392
Damn it!

09:20.477 --> 09:21.685
What the hell happened, man?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.687
I don't know. I just...
I wasn't paying attention.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.648
Capp, you relieve
Mills on the roof.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.733
Mills, you take a breather.
No, no, I got it.
Let's do it!

09:27.817 --> 09:30.194
Can't you do
anything right?
I got a guy dying here!

09:30.612 --> 09:33.280
Hey! They're giving it their
all, Welch. Trying like hell.

09:33.365 --> 09:34.907
That's my best
friend in there!
Yeah, I know.

09:34.991 --> 09:36.492
We're gonna get him out.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.412
Who was driving this one?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.206
Right here. Joe Cruz.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.415
Cruz, you wanna step
aside with us?

09:43.500 --> 09:44.875
Now? We're in the
middle of a rescue.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.835
It's okay, Joe.
Go with 'em.

09:50.465 --> 09:52.007
All right,
Capp, you ready?

09:53.134 --> 09:54.593
Go!

09:54.678 --> 09:55.678
Come on!

09:57.764 --> 09:59.598
All right!
Give me a backboard!

09:59.683 --> 10:01.225
Hang in there.
Hang in there.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.309
Come on!

10:03.979 --> 10:05.896
Come on, come on,
get in there.

10:05.981 --> 10:07.439
Blow, please.

10:08.483 --> 10:11.026
Get in there.
Get in there. Easy.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.070
Hang in there, Molina!
Hold him up.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.572
Hold his head up.
Hold his head up.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.616
Three... Get him in.

10:17.701 --> 10:18.909
Easy.

10:19.452 --> 10:22.079
Watch him breathe.
Jesus Christ.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.631
You did this,
you son of a bitch!

10:32.716 --> 10:33.716
You did this!

10:52.736 --> 10:54.987
I guess they were trying
to cut across from Michigan,

10:55.071 --> 10:58.240
but they had to know
we were coming up
Wabash, right?

10:59.117 --> 11:00.784
Either way, they gotta
slow down and have a look.

11:00.869 --> 11:01.869
Everyone knows that.

11:02.912 --> 11:03.996
Unless they had the green.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.414
Please,
they did not have the green.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.082
What the hell, Newhouse?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.835
Are the cops still
all over Cruz?

11:09.919 --> 11:12.296
Yeah. Now, they're
demanding piss and blood.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.923
Standard procedure.

11:18.303 --> 11:19.762
Is that Molina's wife?

11:22.891 --> 11:25.267
He's gonna be all right.
Take it easy.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.273
Poor kid.

11:33.485 --> 11:34.526
Can I see him? Please?

11:34.611 --> 11:35.944
He's gonna be fine.

11:39.699 --> 11:40.949
You've got a lot of
debris in there.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.368
I'm gonna have to
clean that out.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.244
But the injury didn't
penetrate the cornea.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.205
And that tissue
heals quickly.

11:46.289 --> 11:49.124
So, I'll be able to
see out of that eye?

11:49.292 --> 11:50.876
Vision should be
fully restored, yes.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.379
Oh, thank God.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.464
Okay.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.883
I'm not denying there's
been some bad blood

11:57.967 --> 11:59.551
between Lieutenant Welch
and myself,

11:59.636 --> 12:01.804
but it didn't play a role
in this accident.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.389
Not on our end, anyway.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.140
Are you sure that 81
had the right of way?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.518
I didn't see the light myself,

12:07.602 --> 12:10.229
but I trust
Joe Cruz implicitly.

12:10.313 --> 12:12.022
Even though he doesn't
remember seeing
the light, either?

12:12.357 --> 12:15.150
If the light was red,
he'd have come to
a controlled stop.

12:15.819 --> 12:16.902
He's good at his job.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.946
Here's the problem, Casey.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.198
The cops still haven't found
a credible eye witness,

12:21.282 --> 12:23.242
there was no traffic cam
at that intersection.

12:23.326 --> 12:24.910
And of the two
drivers involved,

12:24.994 --> 12:26.578
one can't remember
what color the light was,

12:26.663 --> 12:28.580
and one might not live
through the night.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.625
I stand by Joe Cruz.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.463
That's all for now.

12:40.635 --> 12:41.760
Hey.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.262
Wait, wait, sorry.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.721
Not here.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.103
Um... Good news on Mouch.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.939
He'll still gonna be able
to watch TV with both eyes.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.108
Good. That's really good.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.943
I'm gonna check in on him.

13:15.712 --> 13:17.379
Okay, everyone from 51.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.800
Let's move out.
Nothing more we can do here.

13:23.011 --> 13:24.470
Come on.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.852
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

13:32.979 --> 13:35.606
Pretty nasty spill you had
back there. What happened?

13:35.690 --> 13:37.608
Yeah, I just got
sloppy, I guess.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.860
You don't get sloppy, Mills.

13:39.944 --> 13:42.821
It's nothing, I, um...
Getting dizzy.

13:42.906 --> 13:43.906
Since when?

13:44.699 --> 13:46.074
Since the building collapse,
I guess.

13:46.784 --> 13:50.746
It's all those pain meds
for my leg. It's just taking
a while to go away.

13:51.414 --> 13:52.915
Go see a doctor.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.919
Yeah, I will if it
doesn't clear up soon...
Before next shift.

14:17.607 --> 14:20.817
We should have a spare
truck here from the shop
pretty soon.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.611
That old beast
with the bad clutch?

14:24.614 --> 14:26.949
We're gonna get anybody
to fill in for Mouch?

14:27.242 --> 14:28.784
I'm rehiring the whole crew.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.411
You guys are done
with your shift.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.497
Chief, that's not necessary.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.790
You've been rattled.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.210
Go home. Rest.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.822
Seen a lot worse.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.448
You're lucky you didn't
break that leg again.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.909
Yeah.

15:10.994 --> 15:12.786
I should be
more careful, huh?

15:12.870 --> 15:16.665
I understand that you, uh,
reached out to your dad's
family.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.672
Well, I know Newhouse
didn't go shooting off
his mouth about that,

15:23.756 --> 15:25.257
so my mom must've called you.

15:25.341 --> 15:26.883
Asked you to get involved.

15:26.968 --> 15:29.177
Yeah, I ran into her
in the bank.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.763
Either way, um,

15:32.432 --> 15:34.057
you can tell her
that I'm over it,

15:34.142 --> 15:36.101
that it was just
a passing interest.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.061
Yeah, I told her
I thought it was a...

15:38.146 --> 15:39.521
Great idea.

15:40.106 --> 15:43.358
See, your dad,
he always talked a lot
about his family,

15:44.527 --> 15:46.737
and he wanted to
patch things up.

15:50.366 --> 15:51.366
Why didn't he?

15:52.076 --> 15:53.535
Something always came up.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.914
Always some reason
not to take the hard road.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.042
But I know
that he regretted it.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.878
He died with that
hanging over him.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.715
He wanted his children to
know where they came from.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.305
You know what?
I think I found out
all that I need to know.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.266
Peter...

16:16.768 --> 16:20.354
Um, pardon me, Chief.
Chief Tiberg is here
to see you.

16:23.358 --> 16:24.691
Thank you, Connie.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.701
Do I have clearance
to hug you now?

16:34.869 --> 16:35.911
You do.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.706
Oh, man...

16:40.833 --> 16:42.668
When that mayday
came through...

16:42.752 --> 16:44.169
I know.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.589
But I'm okay.

16:50.510 --> 16:53.011
Boden's sending you
guys home, huh?
Yeah.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.681
Yeah. He looks out
for his people.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.309
In fact, maybe you should
sit down for this.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.274
So, uh...

17:09.445 --> 17:12.114
Boden and I have been
talking about making you
our candidate

17:12.198 --> 17:13.323
on Truck 81.

17:14.784 --> 17:17.369
He's willing to turn
a blind eye to
our relationship.

17:17.453 --> 17:18.870
So, if this is something
you're interested in...

17:19.372 --> 17:22.124
Yeah! Yes, yes!
Absolutely, yes!

17:23.918 --> 17:26.461
Okay. Well, great.

17:29.257 --> 17:31.883
- Ambulance 61. Chest pains.
- Polk and Clinton.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.885
We can talk about
the details later.

17:34.011 --> 17:36.054
This... This is amazing!
Yeah.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.565
We should take turns
standing watch for Molina.

17:46.649 --> 17:49.526
Make sure somebody
from 81 is at the
hospital at all times.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.320
All right. I'll go
straight there, if someone
can relieve me tonight.

17:52.405 --> 17:55.407
Cruz and I are gonna run down
to Roseland and take a look
at a hot dog truck.

17:55.491 --> 17:57.075
But then we'll swing by.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.577
Casey, Cruz.

18:02.957 --> 18:04.499
Over here, now.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.758
What's this?

18:16.179 --> 18:18.597
I thought there was
no traffic camera
at 24th and Wabash.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.265
This is four blocks south.

18:20.349 --> 18:22.267
And there's 81 racing
through a red light,

18:22.351 --> 18:24.352
30 seconds before
the collision.

18:25.188 --> 18:27.105
That was a controlled stop.

18:27.190 --> 18:28.690
Controlled stop, my ass.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.401
You blew that light
at 20 miles an hour,
at least.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.446
Chief, everybody breaks
the controlled stop rule,

18:34.530 --> 18:36.072
you pretty much have to!
That's your defense?

18:36.199 --> 18:37.491
"All the kids are doing it?"

18:38.367 --> 18:39.493
Chief, you wanna
back me up here?

18:39.577 --> 18:41.369
I would stop talking
now, Joe.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.832
We were on our way
to a fire.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.627
If we made a controlled
stop at every light,
there would be...

18:48.711 --> 18:51.254
Then Molina would be back
at his firehouse instead
of on life support.

18:52.882 --> 18:55.217
Cruz, you should
talk to your union rep

18:55.301 --> 18:56.885
before you say
another word.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.929
Better yet,
a criminal lawyer.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.556
If Molina can't
pull out of this,

19:02.391 --> 19:04.476
you're looking at
manslaughter charges.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.327
Hey.
Hey!

19:22.411 --> 19:24.496
How was the rest of shift?

19:24.580 --> 19:27.499
More restful
than your evening,
from the looks of it.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.085
How's Cruz?

19:30.586 --> 19:33.255
He's a tough guy. Man...

19:33.923 --> 19:36.091
This isn't fair.
Yeah.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.847
Listen, um,
I realize that, uh...

19:41.931 --> 19:44.933
I was pretty quick
to respond yesterday,
about joining 81.

19:45.768 --> 19:48.270
You were excited.
Oh, I still am.

19:48.646 --> 19:51.231
But I also get that...

19:51.315 --> 19:53.817
That maybe there needs to
be more of a conversation.

19:53.901 --> 19:56.486
There's a lot to it,
that's for sure.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.738
We're not actually gonna be
able to get married, huh?

19:58.823 --> 20:00.282
As long as
I'm working under you?

20:01.117 --> 20:03.326
Well, we'd have to put
the wedding on hold.

20:03.411 --> 20:06.872
At least until
you've completed your
first year as candidate.

20:06.956 --> 20:09.332
Then you'd have to transfer
to another shift or company.

20:12.587 --> 20:14.713
This would really affect us.

20:14.797 --> 20:16.965
Professionally
and personally.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.593
And I feel bad,
because I'm the one
who benefits.

20:19.677 --> 20:21.803
We both get
something out of it.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.390
You'd be willing to
put me in harm's way?

20:26.851 --> 20:29.561
I'd assign you any task
I think you're capable of.

20:29.979 --> 20:32.480
And if I stepped out
of line, you'd discipline me?

20:33.190 --> 20:34.858
With great enthusiasm.

20:39.030 --> 20:42.240
If you didn't think
this was a good idea,
would you tell me?

20:42.325 --> 20:43.742
Of course.

20:49.665 --> 20:51.333
Everyone's meeting
at the hospital.

20:52.043 --> 20:53.501
Yeah, we should go.

20:58.132 --> 21:00.383
What's the upshot
on that hot dog truck?

21:00.468 --> 21:02.928
Oh. Guy sold it
before we could get there.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.180
I was busy arranging
a sit-down between

21:05.264 --> 21:07.432
Cruz and a criminal lawyer
friend of my brother's.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.476
That's probably
a smart move.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.685
Except Cruz
never showed up.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.187
I don't need a lawyer.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.022
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.234
Hey. What's the word?

21:20.321 --> 21:23.114
Molina's out of surgery,
but they're keeping him
under, due to brain swelling.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.367
Doesn't look good.
Damn.

21:28.371 --> 21:29.871
Hey, I'll be right back.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.506
Lieutenant Welch?
Yeah.

21:42.218 --> 21:46.429
I just wanted to let you
know that I feel awful
about the accident.

21:46.597 --> 21:47.973
Yeah, I should hope so.

21:51.936 --> 21:53.478
Okay, look,
I just came by to say,

21:53.562 --> 21:55.313
if there's anything
that I can do
for Molina's people,

21:55.398 --> 21:57.399
or for you and your guys...
Sure, there is.

21:57.692 --> 21:59.067
Get your eyes checked!

22:02.446 --> 22:03.738
You know what?

22:04.073 --> 22:06.449
I feel for Molina, I do.

22:07.243 --> 22:08.827
But this wasn't my fault.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.912
Molina is ten times
the firefighter you are!

22:11.455 --> 22:14.207
Hey, come on.
I didn't do anything wrong!

22:15.668 --> 22:18.003
I'm sick and tired of
getting the stink-eye
everywhere I go!

22:18.087 --> 22:20.088
Come on, guys,
why hash this out now?

22:20.172 --> 22:21.923
Let's let the white
shirts handle this.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.467
Keep that bald-headed douche
away from me or I'll put him
in a coma.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.553
- Hey, hey, hey! Welch...
- Joe.

22:26.637 --> 22:28.722
We're all here
for the same reason!

22:29.598 --> 22:31.975
We want Molina home,
safe and sound,

22:32.059 --> 22:33.184
and then God willing,

22:33.269 --> 22:34.811
be back on the job,
as soon as possible.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.313
Back on the job?
The guy could be brain dead!

22:37.398 --> 22:39.858
All right. Look...

22:41.527 --> 22:43.403
What are you guys
doing for his family?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.155
You got anything planned?

22:46.782 --> 22:48.033
We're still
figuring that out.

22:49.535 --> 22:51.036
Let me offer up Molly's.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.704
We'll host a thing.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.039
Both houses.

22:54.790 --> 22:55.957
You guys in?

22:58.169 --> 22:59.252
He gonna be there?

23:01.422 --> 23:03.381
Everybody's invited.

23:03.466 --> 23:05.592
You want to help
Molina out or not?

23:06.469 --> 23:07.802
Of course.

23:13.476 --> 23:16.019
Listen, you should go.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.812
What? No!

23:18.481 --> 23:19.773
I got every right
to be here!

23:19.815 --> 23:21.566
I leave now,
I look guilty.
No.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.610
You look like
the bigger man.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.908
Come on.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.168
Oh, uh...

23:41.337 --> 23:42.670
Sorry, Lieutenant.

23:44.465 --> 23:46.674
Everybody's inside.
I know.

23:52.348 --> 23:53.640
So, what're you
doing out here?

23:56.393 --> 23:57.811
Molina wake up yet?

24:05.152 --> 24:09.072
I can't do another funeral
for a line-of-duty death, man.
I just can't.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.583
Yeah, I hear that.

24:39.186 --> 24:42.105
All right, now just
keep your eyes open.
Okay.

24:45.651 --> 24:47.569
And hold this position.

24:48.529 --> 24:50.029
Still holding.

24:50.614 --> 24:51.781
Still holding.

24:53.242 --> 24:55.702
And there it is.
You feel that?

24:55.786 --> 24:56.786
Yeah.
All right.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.833
Now, that eye movement
is called nystagmus,

25:01.917 --> 25:05.712
and what it tells me is,
you've got benign paroxysmal
positional vertigo.

25:06.130 --> 25:08.548
BPPV.
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

25:08.632 --> 25:11.801
I've been trying all those,
uh, rehabilitation exercises.

25:11.886 --> 25:15.889
The, um, the Epley maneuver
and a couple others
for the last month or so.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.183
Still no improvement
in your equilibrium?
No.

25:18.267 --> 25:20.393
Well, the vestibular
organs in your right ear

25:20.477 --> 25:23.771
probably suffered blast trauma
in the building collapse.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.149
I guess we were so
focused on your leg,
we didn't notice.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.567
Yeah.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.279
Well, now that we know,
what do we do?

25:33.824 --> 25:36.117
The main thing I need
you to understand is,

25:36.952 --> 25:39.329
I can't clear you
for squad duty.

25:43.667 --> 25:44.792
Um...

25:47.713 --> 25:49.797
Dr. Bachman, come on. I...

25:50.883 --> 25:54.219
Um, I just
got back to work.

25:55.095 --> 25:57.555
What about medication?
That'll only mask
the symptoms.

25:57.640 --> 26:00.391
I still can't let you climb
ladders or do rope work,

26:00.476 --> 26:01.643
or scuba dive.

26:04.104 --> 26:06.064
What the hell do
I do? I mean...

26:06.148 --> 26:08.066
You're just telling me
that I'm done...

26:08.150 --> 26:09.442
Peter,
this condition is mild.

26:09.818 --> 26:11.694
There are lots of careers
you could still perform.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.364
Yeah, just not this one!

26:16.951 --> 26:18.993
I'm a firefighter, okay?

26:19.745 --> 26:22.580
And if I'm not that,
then what am I?

26:36.762 --> 26:40.932
You were right, Cruz.
They gave us the old beast
with the bad clutch.

26:41.600 --> 26:43.309
I think they did it
to punish us.

26:44.520 --> 26:47.563
Ugh, this thing is
a bitch to drive.

26:48.190 --> 26:51.276
Yeah. Well,
uh, about that, um...

26:51.902 --> 26:54.404
Your driving privileges
have been suspended,

26:54.488 --> 26:56.322
pending the investigation.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.617
Otis, you're driving for now.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.369
Seriously?

27:06.000 --> 27:09.711
This is a total crock, dude.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.213
Don't worry, it's all
gonna work itself out.

27:12.589 --> 27:14.048
Hey, Joe...

27:14.508 --> 27:15.800
Molina's gonna make it.

27:16.010 --> 27:18.886
Somebody's gonna come forward,
testify you had the light.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.141
Oh, boy, look here!

27:23.225 --> 27:25.393
Argh, matey!

27:25.477 --> 27:27.228
Hey, boys.
Mr. Mouch!

27:27.354 --> 27:31.065
Why aren't you home resting?
Ah, I need to be
around my brothers.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.234
Ow! How's your peeper?

27:33.819 --> 27:35.903
Well, you know, I'm, uh...

27:36.447 --> 27:39.991
Dealing with a fairly
serious corneal abrasion,

27:40.075 --> 27:41.743
and all that
that entails, so...

27:41.827 --> 27:43.578
What does that entail?

27:44.413 --> 27:45.455
Uh...

27:45.539 --> 27:47.206
Eye drops, mainly.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.088
Hey.
Hey, Chief.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.049
Is Mills out sick
or something?
I'm missing a man.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.342
You haven't spoken to him?

28:00.346 --> 28:03.681
He left me a message
or two the other day.
I guess I forgot to call him.

28:04.099 --> 28:06.976
Severide, when you go
off shift lately, you go
into a 48-hour black hole.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.102
Why is that?

28:09.563 --> 28:11.647
Chief, I'm... I'm just
trying to find Mills.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.360
Peter Mills failed his
medical examination
and he is off squad.

28:21.909 --> 28:24.285
Yeah. Maybe you should
reach out to him.

28:26.288 --> 28:27.789
Right, yeah. Absolutely.

28:34.296 --> 28:36.881
Hey, this is Pete.
Leave a message.

28:36.965 --> 28:38.841
Mills, hey,
it's Severide.

28:39.426 --> 28:40.968
Boden told me the news.

28:41.053 --> 28:43.846
Um, must've been something
wrong with my phone,

28:43.931 --> 28:45.515
I didn't see your
messages until now.

28:45.933 --> 28:48.267
Anyway, uh,
give me a call.

28:54.149 --> 28:55.149
Hey, Chief.

28:58.570 --> 29:01.489
Um, Casey told me what
you were willing to do
on my behalf.

29:01.907 --> 29:03.574
Yeah. Well,
I was appreciative

29:03.659 --> 29:05.159
of what you did for me
and for this house.

29:05.244 --> 29:08.079
Oh, yeah, of course.
But I know how you feel about,

29:08.163 --> 29:11.082
um, officers and
firefighters co-mingling,

29:11.166 --> 29:14.168
and I just wanna let
you know that Casey and I...

29:14.253 --> 29:16.838
We get it.
The job comes first.
Right.

29:18.006 --> 29:20.049
And we acknowledge that
this kind of arrangement

29:20.134 --> 29:23.052
could put a lot of pressure
on us, but I feel confident

29:23.137 --> 29:24.178
that we can deal with it.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.767
We're taking this
very seriously.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.186
Good to hear.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.355
You tell me when you decide.

29:37.401 --> 29:39.360
Okay. Will do, Chief.
Thanks.

29:39.445 --> 29:40.445
Hmm.

29:44.408 --> 29:48.035
So, our beer distributor
is gonna donate a couple
of kegs of beer,

29:48.120 --> 29:50.788
and my cousin Mikey is gonna
loan us a PA system,

29:50.873 --> 29:53.708
which, knowing Mikey,
is gonna be a karaoke machine.

29:54.042 --> 29:55.710
It's your funeral,
Christopher.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.588
Trudy!
No, no, no.
Don't you get up.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.214
How are you, hon?

30:00.299 --> 30:01.549
Ah, you know.
Aw!

30:03.260 --> 30:06.512
Are those brownies?
I'm sorry. Were you
blinded in one eye?

30:07.723 --> 30:10.141
Do you wanna
put your feet up, hon?
I do.

30:10.225 --> 30:12.810
Hey, uh, Mustache,
you wanna get him a pillow?

30:12.895 --> 30:14.145
Hey, hey! Get back here.

30:14.229 --> 30:16.731
You think this fundraiser
is gonna plan itself?

30:17.274 --> 30:20.234
Oh, for that poor fireman?
Hey, you know who throws
a great party?

30:20.319 --> 30:22.612
Atwater. You want me to tell
him you guys need a hand?

30:22.696 --> 30:24.822
Nah, we already talked
to him. He's busy.

30:24.907 --> 30:27.074
He'll be there.
Yo, pillow?

30:27.576 --> 30:28.993
Isn't she great?

30:29.077 --> 30:31.037
Mouch, Cruz.
Newhouse wants you.

30:41.924 --> 30:44.342
Ask and you shall receive.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.719
Where'd this come from?

30:46.929 --> 30:48.429
Guy I met during a thing.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.264
That's not an explanation.

30:50.474 --> 30:52.433
Is that a bullet hole?

30:52.643 --> 30:55.895
Uh, yeah, well, I can, uh,
I can throw in a can of Bondo.

30:56.605 --> 30:57.897
Newhouse, who owns this thing?

30:58.732 --> 31:00.983
- Say the word and you do.
- Really?

31:01.360 --> 31:02.443
For how much?

31:03.695 --> 31:06.697
Let's say, 20% of Molly's Two.

31:10.536 --> 31:11.744
You want to be a partner?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.465
That's Leonard Mills,
in the wheelchair.

31:26.927 --> 31:28.427
What's wrong with him?
Is he sick?

31:28.512 --> 31:30.596
Yes, he's stage four.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.354
Thank you.

31:45.529 --> 31:47.530
Excuse me, Leonard Mills?

31:48.824 --> 31:51.993
I already told
the other one,
I'm not hungry.

31:57.833 --> 31:59.667
You're not an orderly.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.591
No. No, I'm not.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.679
You're a fireman.

32:25.819 --> 32:27.987
You look
just like your mother.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.574
Yeah, you're
damn right I do.

32:37.039 --> 32:39.457
So, I guess
I'm your grandfather.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.377
I guess so.

32:57.351 --> 32:58.517
Peter.

33:01.730 --> 33:03.147
Peter.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.905
I sure am glad to know you.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.676
I mean, he trotted out
the usual excuses, you know?

33:32.135 --> 33:34.053
"Times were different,
blah de blah, blah."

33:35.889 --> 33:37.139
Whatever.

33:38.767 --> 33:41.102
I saw a lot of my
father in him.

33:42.604 --> 33:45.314
He asked if I was
firefighter, like Dad.

33:45.399 --> 33:48.317
I couldn't bring myself
to admit the truth, that...

33:48.402 --> 33:49.777
That I'm not anymore.

33:50.654 --> 33:54.198
Mills, I don't get how this
thing is ending your career.

33:54.282 --> 33:57.410
I mean, it's not
keeping you off the
basketball court, right?

33:58.120 --> 34:00.329
It's fine as long
as I'm upright.

34:00.789 --> 34:03.165
But firefighting is
out of the question.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.419
Oh, so there's no
chance that this thing
could clear up someday?

34:07.754 --> 34:09.255
Yeah, someday.

34:11.675 --> 34:12.758
Newhouse, when I was a kid,

34:12.843 --> 34:14.635
I used to think
that it was okay to say that

34:14.720 --> 34:16.679
"I'm gonna be
a firefighter someday."

34:17.597 --> 34:19.432
I ain't a kid anymore.

34:19.516 --> 34:22.727
You know, this is my life's
calling, and it's just

34:22.811 --> 34:24.311
flushed down the drain.

34:24.646 --> 34:26.313
What the hell's
that even mean?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.399
I don't think you understand.
My dad was a fire...

34:28.483 --> 34:29.608
Your dad lived
his life, right?

34:30.736 --> 34:32.486
All right.
Now, you living yours.

34:32.779 --> 34:33.988
Hell, I get it.

34:34.156 --> 34:37.032
It's a fine thing
to honor your pops by
filling his shoes, but,

34:37.826 --> 34:39.827
if those shoes don't fit,

34:40.162 --> 34:42.788
it doesn't mean you have to
go through life barefoot.

34:46.209 --> 34:47.418
Hey.

34:47.502 --> 34:50.171
Hey, where, uh, where does
Herrmann want this thing?

34:50.839 --> 34:52.548
Uh... Up here by the door.

34:58.638 --> 35:01.515
Okay. Uh, I guess
we're done here.

35:01.975 --> 35:03.851
Yeah. See you later, right?

35:05.604 --> 35:07.021
Yeah, maybe.

35:07.522 --> 35:09.273
Aren't you coming to
the fundraiser?

35:09.524 --> 35:12.026
You didn't even
want me at the hospital.

35:12.360 --> 35:13.569
That was different.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.780
Really? What's changed?

35:16.531 --> 35:18.949
Well, a few days have
passed, your drug tests
came back clean...

35:19.034 --> 35:21.619
Yeah, I'm still getting a
bunch of sideways looks,
Casey.

35:21.912 --> 35:24.371
I don't wanna
deal with it.
Hell with them.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.625
We all know you
didn't do anything.

35:27.709 --> 35:30.377
Do you know that?
'Cause I don't.

35:30.962 --> 35:33.464
I keep replaying it
over and over in my head.

35:33.548 --> 35:36.008
What color was the light?
Did I check the cross traffic?

35:36.092 --> 35:38.219
But I don't know!
Cruz, listen to me.

35:39.012 --> 35:42.389
Welch thinks you
screwed up. Who cares?

35:43.058 --> 35:45.893
He doesn't know you.
But everybody at 51 does.

35:46.228 --> 35:49.730
None of us have doubted
you for a single second,
all right?

35:50.398 --> 35:52.566
So don't you dare start
doubting yourself.

36:03.954 --> 36:05.704
Thanks, man.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.415
Whoa, $20 cover tonight.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.377
I already paid.
I just stepped out
to feed the meter.

36:11.628 --> 36:13.003
Is that right?

36:13.380 --> 36:14.588
I already paid!

36:15.966 --> 36:18.008
Oh, man.
What's up, man?

36:18.093 --> 36:20.052
You good, bro.
Thank you.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.220
Hey!

36:23.765 --> 36:25.140
Hey, Mouch.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.309
Come here.

36:30.063 --> 36:32.398
I got some bad news
for you guys.

36:32.482 --> 36:33.774
Oh, no. What?

36:38.989 --> 36:42.616
Casey and I,
we're splitting up.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.119
What? Get out of here.

36:47.372 --> 36:51.041
Yeah. But, um,
on the bright side,

36:51.126 --> 36:52.960
I'm free to join you
on Truck 81.

36:53.461 --> 36:55.504
Yeah!

36:56.840 --> 36:58.340
Yeah!
Yes!

37:02.804 --> 37:05.222
I know this could
be tricky,

37:05.307 --> 37:07.224
but it'll be
worth the trouble.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.728
You're the best lieutenant
I've ever seen.

37:11.021 --> 37:14.064
And you're gonna make me
into a better firefighter
more than anyone else could.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.357
Hell, yes, I am.

37:18.361 --> 37:19.778
Hey! To Gabby Dawson!

37:20.488 --> 37:22.740
Welcome to Truck 81, baby!
Yeah!

37:27.954 --> 37:30.623
Hey, uh, listen up, everybody.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.708
I just got off the phone
with Chief Boden,

37:32.876 --> 37:35.002
who's at Chicago Med
right now.

37:35.170 --> 37:38.339
And, um,
I'm happy to report

37:38.423 --> 37:40.257
that Jason Molina

37:40.342 --> 37:43.719
is awake and talking
with the doctors!

37:45.305 --> 37:47.806
But, um, he's got a long
recovery ahead of him,

37:47.891 --> 37:50.601
and his family's counting
on us for the help,

37:50.685 --> 37:52.937
so keep that money
coming in!

37:53.021 --> 37:54.939
- All right? Yeah!
- Yeah!

38:19.255 --> 38:21.423
Chief. We heard
Molina was awake.

38:21.508 --> 38:23.842
Got a little
something for him.

38:23.927 --> 38:26.679
Yeah, he's up.
And he's come clean.

38:29.265 --> 38:31.475
He says Lieutenant Welch
gave him the nod.

38:32.811 --> 38:35.229
A signal Molina
understood to mean,

38:35.313 --> 38:38.315
beat 81 to the scene,
come hell or high water.

38:39.567 --> 38:42.403
Molina and Welch
are taking the heat
for this one.

38:43.405 --> 38:44.738
You're off the hook, Cruz.

38:58.086 --> 39:02.506
Casey, while we have
Chief Tiberg, do you have
an answer on Dawson?

39:04.926 --> 39:06.427
Uh, yeah, yeah.

39:07.470 --> 39:10.431
We'd like to have
Gabriela Dawson
on Truck 81.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.350
Dawson?

39:13.435 --> 39:15.978
I thought there was
some reason you
didn't want to do that?

39:16.062 --> 39:18.188
Personal issues.
It's resolved now.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.067
Great.

39:22.610 --> 39:24.194
The spot's hers.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.543
Chief. Quick question.

39:39.627 --> 39:41.712
If Dawson's moving
over to Truck,

39:41.796 --> 39:44.048
means there's an opening
for a paramedic, correct?

39:45.842 --> 39:47.092
Correct.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.636
Correct.

39:57.312 --> 39:58.520
Molina.

40:03.443 --> 40:05.986
How are you feeling?
Uh, I'm hanging in there.

40:07.822 --> 40:09.823
This is Daniela, my wife.

40:10.116 --> 40:13.160
Dani, this is
Lieutenant Casey
of Truck 81.

40:14.454 --> 40:16.914
Welch and I got
the two houses together.

40:17.916 --> 40:21.460
Hopefully this is enough
to get you by till
Jason's on his feet.

40:21.544 --> 40:22.878
Thank you.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.339
He will be too.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.507
You watch.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.017
Thank you.

40:38.019 --> 40:39.353
We heard about
your statement.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.064
That took balls.
Yeah.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.359
Well, we reap
what we sow, right?

40:52.158 --> 40:53.534
So they say.
