00:05.083 --> 00:08.708
Do you see Mason anywhere?
Every day this week he's
accidentally run into me

00:08.708 --> 00:12.083
as I was getting on the
elevator, to talk about us
getting back together, again.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.000
Maybe he's hiding...

00:14.000 --> 00:17.708
...from these fresh,
delicious T-bone steaks!

00:19.000 --> 00:21.583
No, he's not here.

00:23.458 --> 00:27.958
Stick me with a spur,
it's Russo and Finkle!

00:29.291 --> 00:31.583
What are you two doing
in my building?

00:32.625 --> 00:34.166
We live here,
right up on the...

00:34.166 --> 00:36.291
No, we, uh, don't, Harper.

00:36.291 --> 00:39.750
Our building just
looks like this building.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.958
Oh. Right.

00:44.958 --> 00:47.958
Yeah, and sometimes we
confuse it with this one,

00:47.958 --> 00:50.208
in case you ever
see us here again.

00:51.291 --> 00:52.958
We just came by
to say hello.

00:52.958 --> 00:55.250
Hello.

00:55.250 --> 00:56.291
And goodbye.

00:56.291 --> 00:59.416
Then why do you
have groceries?

00:59.416 --> 01:03.000
Well... they're gifts.
For you.

01:05.125 --> 01:07.166
Odd gift choice, Russo.

01:08.625 --> 01:12.166
T-bone steaks!
My favorite cut of the cow!

01:13.416 --> 01:15.875
Tell you what? Why don't you
come on up for a visit?

01:15.875 --> 01:20.375
We'd love to Mr. Laritate.
We have to go buy those
exact same gifts for us.

01:21.958 --> 01:24.708
No, I insist. Come on up
and I'll show you how to keep

01:24.708 --> 01:26.458
a Shetland pony as a pet...

01:28.625 --> 01:30.458
...without anyone knowing.

01:31.875 --> 01:33.375
I don't know.

01:33.375 --> 01:34.750
Are you gonna ride it?

01:34.750 --> 01:37.375
"Am I going to ride it?"

01:37.375 --> 01:39.083
I'm gonna jump the couch!

01:40.708 --> 01:42.333
Well, we have to see that.

01:45.708 --> 01:48.416
Oh, no. Uh, uh...
The elevator just broke.

01:48.416 --> 01:50.208
That's funny, I was just on it.

01:50.208 --> 01:53.458
Shh, I won't tell
anyone you did it.

01:54.833 --> 01:56.708
All right, we're gonna have to
hoof it up the stairs.

01:56.708 --> 01:58.875
We can rest halfway.

01:58.875 --> 02:01.958
I live all the way up
on the second floor.

02:58.583 --> 03:00.750
Oh, I got it!

03:00.750 --> 03:03.458
El Chile Diablo.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.750
From the jungles
of South America.

03:05.750 --> 03:09.750
I'm gonna make chili
for this year's Waverly
Place Frontier Days.

03:09.750 --> 03:12.458
It's gonna have people
coming back to the
Sub Station for more.

03:12.458 --> 03:15.000
Isn't that what our
sandwiches are supposed to do?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.750
Yeah well, that ship
sailed years ago.

03:18.750 --> 03:23.625
A good, spicy chili is gonna
make this place memorable.

03:23.625 --> 03:26.000
OK, well whatever you
do, just be careful,

03:26.000 --> 03:28.500
'cause those are superhot,
they'll burn your skin
on contact.

03:28.500 --> 03:32.583
Oh, please. Justin, I know how
to handle a little chili pepper.

03:34.250 --> 03:35.833
Mr. Justin...
Hey, Mr. Justin's dad.

03:40.875 --> 03:43.333
It's touching my skin!

03:43.333 --> 03:45.208
It's burning!

03:48.375 --> 03:50.333
I'm on fire!

03:50.333 --> 03:51.875
It's always good
to see your dad.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.583
Mr. Justin,
I need your help.

03:55.583 --> 03:58.875
You know something?
I've been secretly
hoping the day would come

03:58.875 --> 04:02.875
when one of my former
students came to me and
asked me for my guidance.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.333
I'm touched.
What do you need, friend?

04:05.333 --> 04:08.708
- I think I broke my wand.
- You idiot!

04:08.708 --> 04:11.416
That's the most powerful wand
in the wizard world!

04:11.416 --> 04:13.583
I don't know what happened.
I went to bed last night
and it was fine.

04:13.583 --> 04:15.583
When I woke up this morning,
it wasn't working.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.125
- It's a fake.
- How can you tell?

04:19.125 --> 04:22.958
I don't know a wizard wand
that takes double-A batteries.

04:25.208 --> 04:28.166
- Well, then where's my wand?
- I hate to say this, Felix,

04:28.166 --> 04:31.208
but I think someone switched
this fake wand with your wand,

04:31.208 --> 04:33.291
the most powerful wand
in the wizard world.

04:33.291 --> 04:37.125
No! Why would somebody
do something like that?

04:37.125 --> 04:40.708
Hmm. I don't know, maybe
because it's the most powerful
wand in the wizard world!

04:42.416 --> 04:44.708
And this is the lounge area.

04:44.708 --> 04:47.125
Now, we don't have
a lot of zombies here,

04:47.125 --> 04:50.958
so I'm gonna have to ask you
to clean up any rotting flesh
you leave behind.

04:53.125 --> 04:57.833
Oh, hey girls. This is
Abercrombie Zombie,
your new neighbor.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.583
He's "dying"
to live here.

05:02.708 --> 05:05.500
It's... a zombie.
Oh, I'm terrible at jokes.

05:07.375 --> 05:09.416
Oh, hi, it's nice
to meet you...

05:09.416 --> 05:11.875
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry!

05:14.166 --> 05:16.875
He says it's OK.
It happens all the time.

05:16.875 --> 05:19.625
- You can speak Zombie?
- It's called "Zombish."

05:19.625 --> 05:22.000
Every wizard learns it
when they're little.

05:30.750 --> 05:33.333
He says your brains
smell cute and tasty.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.458
Oh. Why, thank you.

05:39.125 --> 05:42.833
Um... Why don't I show you
the laundry room?

05:42.833 --> 05:45.583
Now, no offense...

05:45.583 --> 05:48.958
...but you might want to throw
in a load as soon as possible.

05:54.708 --> 05:56.125
Hi, Alex.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.583
I have not been sitting here
waiting for you all day.

06:00.583 --> 06:02.500
Why would you accuse me
of such a thing?

06:03.958 --> 06:06.000
I haven't even
said anything yet.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.583
Oh, gravy boat! I skipped ahead
on my rehearsed encounter
with you.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.625
This is gonna be another awkward
relationship talk, isn't it?

06:14.625 --> 06:18.208
You know what?
I'm just gonna stay here.

06:18.208 --> 06:21.583
Wha...? Don't you leave me
alone with him, Harper Finkle!

06:23.250 --> 06:24.458
Hi, Mason.

06:24.458 --> 06:26.708
Alex, I've made a list
of the pros and cons

06:26.708 --> 06:28.958
of us getting back together.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.875
Well, I mean, I listed the pros.
There were no cons.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.166
Sh! Mason, quiet down.
This is my jam.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.458
Alex, please.
Listen to me.

06:38.458 --> 06:40.375
This time in the elevator
is the only one-on-one time

06:40.375 --> 06:43.250
- I get to spend with you.
-♪ Do, do, do, doo, do, do ♪

06:43.250 --> 06:45.500
Alex, please, listen to me!

06:46.958 --> 06:48.375
Mason, what
are you doing?

06:48.375 --> 06:50.875
I'm trying to stop us, so I can
get a few minutes with you.

06:50.875 --> 06:53.083
Stop it, you're
gonna break it!

06:54.583 --> 06:57.375
Like that.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.708
- Hello!
- Hello.

07:05.708 --> 07:08.458
The elevator works perfectly.

07:08.458 --> 07:10.625
If it doesn't, I had
nothing to do with it.

07:10.625 --> 07:13.375
What are you talking about?

07:13.375 --> 07:15.000
Um, I think that's
a little personal.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.500
- Run!
- Yeah.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.458
How rude.

07:19.458 --> 07:22.833
That's why I refuse
to see my grandchildren.

07:25.708 --> 07:27.750
That's strange.

07:27.750 --> 07:31.416
Since when did this building
get a 13th floor?

07:41.458 --> 07:43.000
Check your pockets again.

07:44.625 --> 07:47.166
Nope. Still gone.

07:47.166 --> 07:51.583
OK. here's the first batch
of Chili Diablo.

07:51.583 --> 07:55.416
- Who wants to try?
- Not now, Dad.
We have a big problem.

07:55.416 --> 07:57.208
Felix's wand is missing.

07:57.208 --> 08:01.250
Oh. Have you tried
the Abraca-doodler's
Wand Locator App?

08:01.250 --> 08:03.750
See, every wand
has a security beacon

08:03.750 --> 08:06.583
that shows you its
exact location on a map.

08:06.583 --> 08:09.000
Felix, just punch in
your security code.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.625
Oh, great, my wand
is still in New York.

08:16.625 --> 08:18.625
It's moving around
the building like it's flying.

08:18.625 --> 08:22.708
Ooh, or the building
is flying around the wand.

08:24.708 --> 08:27.208
Yeah, you're right,
it's probably the wand.

08:29.000 --> 08:31.708
Something's weird.
I'm calling Professor Crumbs.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.416
Good idea.

08:35.416 --> 08:37.833
Are you sure you guys
don't want to try the chili?

08:53.208 --> 08:56.333
- What's going on?
- The 13th floor
button was exposed

08:56.333 --> 08:57.833
and the non-wizard tenants
have been coming up.

08:57.833 --> 08:59.875
- What are we gonna do?
- Oh, no.

08:59.875 --> 09:02.000
I bet it happened when
you banged on the buttons.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.291
Don't try to pin this on me.
I just wanted to talk about
our relationship.

09:05.291 --> 09:08.333
Excuse me. We all came
up here to find out

09:08.333 --> 09:12.083
where this mysterious
13th floor came from.

09:12.083 --> 09:15.125
And who is that stinky freak

09:15.125 --> 09:18.500
grunting in the corner? Whoo!

09:21.458 --> 09:26.208
What have you done? Exposing
this floor could ruin my plans!

09:26.208 --> 09:28.625
- What plans?
- Oh, it's all falling apart!

09:30.458 --> 09:33.416
Dexter, calm down.
I'll handle this.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.708
OK! Everybody,
listen up. Um...

09:38.708 --> 09:42.000
There is a simple
explanation for all of this.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.875
You accidentally discovered
the secret haunted house

09:47.875 --> 09:50.958
that Dexter has been planning
for all of you. You spoiled it!

09:53.250 --> 09:54.750
I hope you're happy.

09:56.458 --> 09:59.166
I love a good
haunted house.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.583
I hope they have
a costume contest.

10:01.583 --> 10:04.375
I still fit into
my saucy kitty outfit.

10:06.708 --> 10:09.833
OK, everyone, please
forget you ever saw this,

10:09.833 --> 10:12.083
and do not tell anyone.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.875
OK, Dexter. We don't want
to spoil the surprise.

10:15.875 --> 10:18.000
- Let's go, everybody.
- Yeah, that's right.

10:18.000 --> 10:22.250
Everybody out! Keep your arms,
legs, feet, hands and toes
inside the elevator.

10:22.250 --> 10:24.250
And just ignore that little
13th floor button.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.583
Yeah, uh-huh,
thank you. Buh-bye.

10:32.416 --> 10:35.708
I'm sorry, Dexter. I'll be
very careful with the elevator
buttons from now on.

10:36.625 --> 10:38.000
You better.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.875
Because of you, I gotta
make plans for a haunted house.

10:43.958 --> 10:47.458
All right, you guys better
fix the elevator before
somebody else comes up.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.083
Of course.

10:53.583 --> 10:55.583
Finkle? Russo?

10:55.583 --> 10:57.166
The British buckaroo?

10:57.166 --> 10:59.750
Mr. Laritate, why are you
dressed like that?

11:00.958 --> 11:03.625
For the Frontier Days
square dance.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.458
The big question is...

11:05.458 --> 11:09.958
what are you all doing
on this mysterious 13th floor?

11:09.958 --> 11:14.375
You know, I've spent years
thinking there was something
strange about you, Russo.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.291
Now I see you with...
Zombie Guy, and...

11:18.583 --> 11:20.458
...Weird Ears...

11:20.458 --> 11:22.708
... hands out of
a trash chute!

11:24.833 --> 11:27.875
Yes, because
this is a haunted house.

11:27.875 --> 11:30.583
Haunted house, my caboose.

11:30.583 --> 11:36.000
It's more like a weird,
parallel magic universe,

11:36.000 --> 11:38.708
and you're somehow a part of it.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.500
He's onto us.
Somebody do something.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.458
Abercrombie, what did you do?

11:52.125 --> 11:54.291
Mr. Laritate, are you OK?

12:03.583 --> 12:07.166
You should never say,
"Somebody do something,"
with a zombie in the room.

12:18.750 --> 12:21.375
Hurry up and find
a spell that will
turn Mr. Laritate back.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.000
I'm running out
of bathroom spray.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.708
Will you put that away, Harper?

12:24.708 --> 12:27.208
It smells like a springtime
fresh cemetery in here.

12:34.416 --> 12:36.375
We need more than
a first aid kit.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.375
He's a sneeze away
from losing his face.

12:41.291 --> 12:42.458
Wait, it's zombie bite ointment.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.000
Excellent. This should
change him back.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.875
Perfect, we'll just
slap some of this goop
on old Laritate and...

12:47.875 --> 12:49.958
Where's Zombie Laritate?

12:53.500 --> 12:55.250
He's gone.
We have to go find him!

12:55.250 --> 12:57.000
Where would
Zombie Laritate go?

12:57.000 --> 12:59.375
Oh! The Waverly Place
Frontier Days.

12:59.375 --> 13:02.416
Even as a zombie,
Laritate wouldn't miss
a good square dance.

13:02.416 --> 13:04.250
Oh, right, let's go.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.083
Uh, you... stay here and
think about what you did.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.125
You're a bad zombie. Bad!

13:26.500 --> 13:29.333
Professor Crumbs,
what are you doing?

13:29.333 --> 13:32.000
I'm looking to see
how big my eye can be.

13:35.125 --> 13:38.583
Felix, when was the last
time you used your wand?

13:38.583 --> 13:42.291
I used it last night in my
apartment to clip my toenails.

13:42.291 --> 13:45.291
You used the most powerful
wand in the wizard world

13:45.291 --> 13:47.583
to clip your toenails?!

13:47.583 --> 13:51.000
Well, the wand
clips them very evenly.

13:51.000 --> 13:53.625
Felix, I didn't know
you had your own apartment.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.333
Mm-hm. I live on the wizard
floor, down at the Windsor.

13:56.333 --> 13:59.833
Impossible. There are no
wizard floors at the Windsor.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.708
Yeah, there is. I live right
across the hall from Alex.

14:01.708 --> 14:02.958
A bunch of wizards live there.

14:02.958 --> 14:06.000
You didn't know
about the wizard floor?

14:06.000 --> 14:08.291
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling about this,
Professor Crumbs.

14:08.291 --> 14:12.208
Indeed. We'd better
investigate that wizard floor.

14:12.208 --> 14:13.583
OK, but before you do,

14:13.583 --> 14:15.583
could you guys flash me in,
like, five minutes before you,

14:15.583 --> 14:17.458
so I can pick my undies
up off the floor?

14:17.458 --> 14:21.166

Mason's going to rub some

15:12.250 --> 15:14.333
I never agreed
to the rubbing.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.458
You can't do it now.
Everyone will see

15:19.458 --> 15:21.416

into the Sub Station.

15:21.416 --> 15:24.000
That's usually pretty empty.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.583

What happened?

17:36.291 --> 17:39.291
That depends.
What do you remember last?

17:40.708 --> 17:42.500
I was in my
apartment building...

17:42.500 --> 17:44.583
Great. We'll
start there. Um...

17:44.583 --> 17:47.625
We found you wandering
around your building.

17:47.625 --> 17:51.458
Yes, and you were
sick and out of it.

17:51.458 --> 17:53.708
Do you remember any
of this, Mr. Laritate?

17:53.708 --> 17:56.583
I was on my way
to Frontier Days...

17:56.583 --> 17:59.250
Yes, yes!
Yes, and you are here!

17:59.250 --> 18:02.083
So why don't you get out there
and start square dancing?

18:02.083 --> 18:04.583
Land sakes, they've
already started?!

18:04.583 --> 18:07.458
I hope they haven't danced
the Topeka Two Step yet.

18:07.458 --> 18:10.125
That's my big finishing move.

18:11.458 --> 18:15.000
There you go.
Yee-haw, Laritate!

18:17.000 --> 18:18.875
That man loves
to square dance.

18:18.875 --> 18:20.875
I'd have to say
I quite enjoyed it as well.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.750
Well, maybe because you
had such a good partner.

18:25.708 --> 18:28.083
I did.

18:28.083 --> 18:29.416
Listen, Alex...

18:31.458 --> 18:33.875
I know I'm caught up
in the moment, and you
don't want to hear this...

18:37.875 --> 18:42.458
Oh. I was just gonna talk
about our relationship.

18:42.458 --> 18:44.000
Not that I didn't
love that...

18:44.833 --> 18:46.458
...a lot, actually.

18:47.708 --> 18:49.875
But wait, what happened
to us being just friends?

18:51.625 --> 18:55.000
Well, running around
with you today

18:55.000 --> 18:56.458
made me realize
something.

18:58.000 --> 19:00.500
We can't stay broken up.

19:00.500 --> 19:02.333
We're too good together.

19:05.750 --> 19:08.000
Yippie-ki-ay!

19:09.708 --> 19:12.250
And now we're
broken up again.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.583
I don't understand.

19:17.583 --> 19:21.750
According to my records,
this floor should not exist.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.333
No, I don't want
to be your roommate!

19:29.333 --> 19:33.583
Good news, everybody. Mason
and I are back together. Yay!

19:35.375 --> 19:39.083
Why is nobody clapping?
I won't be walking the
hallways moping anymore.

19:42.083 --> 19:44.208
Justin, what are you
doing here?

19:44.208 --> 19:48.625
Professor Crumbs thinks
we should all leave.
Like, right now.

19:48.625 --> 19:51.291
Yes. It would be in
everyone's best interest

19:51.291 --> 19:54.125
to get as far away
from this place as possible.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.708
I sense a great evil
at work here.

19:56.708 --> 19:59.208
I know this is getting
a little long-winded,

19:59.208 --> 20:03.166
but I can't stress enough
that we have to get
out of this building.

20:07.208 --> 20:09.000
He's an Angel of Darkness!

20:09.000 --> 20:12.000
That's right. And I'm here
to collect your rent.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.708
Just kidding.
You can keep the rent.

20:18.375 --> 20:22.000
- That's Felix's wand!
You stole Felix's wand!
- It was you?

20:22.000 --> 20:27.125
Felix, you can have your wand
back and so much more if you
do what I ask of you.

20:27.125 --> 20:29.500
Don't you want your wand back?

20:29.500 --> 20:32.375
Without it, you're just
another delinquent.

20:40.875 --> 20:44.375
- Felix, what are you doing?
- I'm joining the dark side.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.958
Felix, do this spell

20:47.958 --> 20:50.083
my robot stole
from the Russos' Lair.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.875
That was your robot?

20:51.875 --> 20:53.875
Felix, don't do it.
Be strong!

20:53.875 --> 20:57.958
Make these troubles no more,
go in through the out door.

20:59.458 --> 21:01.625
OK. come on, everybody.
We've gotta get out of here.

21:08.708 --> 21:10.000
Let's take the stairs!

21:20.000 --> 21:21.833
It's no use, Justin.

21:21.833 --> 21:24.458
He cast the "In Through
the Out Door" spell.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.083
We're all trapped here?

21:27.083 --> 21:30.416
Yes you are.
