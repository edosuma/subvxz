Rick:
Not now, Shan.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.370
I just wanted to see
if I can, like, borrow--

11:02.453 --> 11:03.829
-(bang)
-(liquid spills)

11:05.289 --> 11:06.248
(laughing)

11:06.332 --> 11:07.625
-Who closed the door?
-Dad!

11:07.708 --> 11:10.169
-Are you okay, Mom?
-(laughing)

11:10.795 --> 11:11.879
Ugh...

11:27.686 --> 11:30.272

11:30.356 --> 11:34.026
You know Shannon has
yearbook photos next week?

11:34.110 --> 11:36.362
That's great.
She's gonna look
really cool.

11:36.445 --> 11:37.697
Do you have any idea

11:37.780 --> 11:39.865
how much it costs to...

11:39.949 --> 11:42.368
strip, lowlight,
re-highlight, and then

11:42.451 --> 11:44.912
add a gloss, Sam?

11:44.995 --> 11:46.747
-Uh, literally no idea--
-Well,

11:46.831 --> 11:48.582
it's a lot.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.795
You know, I think
maybe you can take it
a little easier on her.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.213
She's just like a kid.

11:54.296 --> 11:56.006
-It's what they do.
They're trying to--
-Sorry, sorry.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.967
Just... excuse me?

11:58.968 --> 12:00.970
I mean, she's a good kid.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.055
Uh-huh, and just
who are you, exactly,

12:03.139 --> 12:05.099
to give advice to anyone

12:05.182 --> 12:07.977
-about literally anything?
-What?

12:08.060 --> 12:10.521
I mean, what are you doing
with your goddamn life?

12:10.604 --> 12:11.939
Jesus Christ, Tricia.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.732
No, no, really.
Actually, I'm asking.

12:13.816 --> 12:17.570
Like, I wanna know.
What are you doing
with your life?

12:17.653 --> 12:19.655
Well, I came home so
I could take care of Holly

12:19.738 --> 12:21.782
-because nobody else
wanted to!
-Okay, right. So,

12:21.866 --> 12:24.785
that was one year?
Right? One.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.620
And so then what were
you doing for the, uh,

12:26.704 --> 12:30.207
is it 10 or 15 years
before that in Lawrence?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.668
What were you doing then?

12:32.751 --> 12:35.588
And then, what have you
been doing since then?

12:35.671 --> 12:37.882
I mean, you're coming at me
really hard right now.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.842
-I don't understand
what this is all about!
-You know what,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.635
it was always
you and Holly.

12:41.719 --> 12:44.013
You and Holly in
your own little world.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.640
And now, you're trying...

12:48.309 --> 12:50.561
to glom onto my daughter,

12:50.644 --> 12:53.355
and make her your new Holly,
and it's not gonna happen.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.483
Wha-- I'm her aunt!
What are you talking about?

12:55.566 --> 12:57.359
I don't understand
what this means!

12:57.443 --> 12:58.819
You're dyeing her hair.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.822
You are giving her
Holly's gay-ass T-shirts.

13:01.906 --> 13:03.949
And I-- I mean, like,

13:04.033 --> 13:05.743
literally gay, okay?
I'm not saying "gay"

13:05.826 --> 13:08.287
-like it's a bad word, gay,
so don't start with all that.
-Oh, yes, you are.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.206
-Yes, you are!
-Could you just...

13:10.289 --> 13:13.626
Could you just chill out
and lower your voice, please?

13:15.419 --> 13:18.672
(quieter):
How can you talk about
our sister that way?

13:18.756 --> 13:22.009
-How? It's our fucking sister.
-I mean,

13:22.092 --> 13:24.428
love the sinner, hate the sin.

13:24.512 --> 13:25.888
It's pretty simple.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.350
Rick:
Babe, I'm still hungry!
What should I eat?

13:31.519 --> 13:34.772
The Mexican casserole's
really good!

13:35.606 --> 13:37.233
There she is.

13:41.362 --> 13:44.615

13:53.123 --> 13:55.417

13:55.501 --> 13:57.419
(bow straining)

13:57.503 --> 13:59.296
(arrow flying, thuds)

13:59.380 --> 14:01.048
You hiding, too?

14:01.131 --> 14:02.675
Yep.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.178
Jesus Christ.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.597
You think we need
to talk to Mom again?

14:09.932 --> 14:11.600
She ain't gonna listen.

14:11.684 --> 14:14.144
(bow straining)

14:14.228 --> 14:16.855
-What a shitty year, huh?
-Yeah.

14:20.359 --> 14:23.237
-(farts)
-(laughs)

14:23.320 --> 14:25.447
-(laughs)
-Love you, too, Dad.

14:25.531 --> 14:28.909
I was pulling down
so hard on the bow
trying to keep it still.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.953
-Here.
-(laughs)

14:31.036 --> 14:32.496
I, uh...

14:32.580 --> 14:35.749
I ran into, uh, Coach Spence
the other day, uh...

14:36.584 --> 14:38.419
You know, he, uh,

14:38.502 --> 14:41.088
he asked about your singing.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.965
What's he care about my singing?

14:43.048 --> 14:45.134
I think he was just wondering
how you were doing.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.846
(sighs) I'm doing great, Dad.

14:48.929 --> 14:51.098
So good.

14:51.181 --> 14:54.393
If anyone asks,
you can just tell them...

14:55.394 --> 14:58.522
(sighs) You know, I just...

15:00.608 --> 15:02.318
I miss her so much.

15:05.446 --> 15:06.739
And...

15:06.822 --> 15:08.907
I don't really know
where I belong here.

15:10.117 --> 15:11.660
And Tricia...

15:14.246 --> 15:15.998
I don't know.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.378
For what it's worth, uh...

15:22.963 --> 15:25.674
-It's nice to have
you back home.
-(arrow flying, thuds)

15:30.763 --> 15:33.057
-(break room chatter)

15:33.140 --> 15:36.143
Todd:
If they're writing about drugs
or if a kid is writing about

15:36.226 --> 15:38.020
having sex with a bunch of
people all at one time,

15:38.103 --> 15:39.605
-that's a problem for me.
-Monica: Yeah,

15:39.688 --> 15:42.274
but if the essay topic was
"What I did on summer vacation,"

15:42.358 --> 15:44.234
-and that's what they did...
-No, no, no. Oh my god.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.987
-...then they're on topic.
-Either way, it puts us
in a difficult situation...

a serious conversation.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.757
Irma said that
I have to talk to you.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.218
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, I don't give a fuck.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.720
I hate that kid.
He's gonna get fired.
Everybody hates that kid.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.138
Sorry, it's just like,
it's like,

16:13.222 --> 16:15.808

this week.
-Joel: Meh.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.352
-It's the fluorescent
lighting in here.

"know you" know you now.

Lower than usual even. (laughs)

to this thing I do.

the Mills Mall?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.809
Yeah, but I'm not really
much of a church person.

16:58.892 --> 17:01.228
No, no. It's church-adjacent.
It's fun.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.647
No presh, but...

17:05.107 --> 17:07.025

would you get over here
