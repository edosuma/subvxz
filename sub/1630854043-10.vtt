STEPHEN: Hi.
- Hi.

50:23.232 --> 50:24.316
[Stephen laughs]

50:27.027 --> 50:27.861
- Hi.

50:33.408 --> 50:34.243
It's good to see you.

50:34.993 --> 50:35.827
- Yeah, you too.

50:35.827 --> 50:37.579
- How are you?
- I'm... I'm good.

50:37.579 --> 50:39.331
- Good?
- Yeah, ho-how are you?

50:39.331 --> 50:40.165
- Good.

50:41.500 --> 50:44.461
You, you, you look great.

50:45.003 --> 50:45.838
- Thank you.

50:46.713 --> 50:48.215
- I'm so fucking tired.

50:48.215 --> 50:50.592
I took a red eye here from JFK.

50:51.885 --> 50:54.429
How has everyone been behaving?
Any meltdowns yet?

50:54.429 --> 50:58.016
- No, no, everyone is,
uh, surprisingly normal.

50:59.434 --> 51:01.937
Wrigley did ruin a dessert tray.

51:02.771 --> 51:05.190
[phone ringing]
- Of course, he did. Sorry, one second.

51:08.235 --> 51:10.404
Hi. You're here?

51:10.946 --> 51:12.865
Yeah, we're all by the pool.

51:12.865 --> 51:14.283
You walk through the main hall,

51:14.283 --> 51:15.868
you can't miss it, we'll see you.

51:16.702 --> 51:18.036
Okay, see you in a sec.

51:19.621 --> 51:22.124
I'm never gonna get used
to saying the word fiancée.

51:22.124 --> 51:24.710
It sounds so formal, you know.

51:27.504 --> 51:30.257
She's gonna be really excited to see you.
She was hoping you'd be here.

51:31.175 --> 51:32.009
- Mm-hmm.

51:32.426 --> 51:34.344
- There she is.

51:35.012 --> 51:36.138
Hi, Lydia.

51:37.347 --> 51:38.223
- This place is crazy.

51:39.766 --> 51:40.851
- Yeah. Always.

51:41.351 --> 51:43.187
- Oh, my God, Lucy.
- Hi.

51:43.520 --> 51:44.354
Hi.

51:48.567 --> 51:50.736
- It's been so long. How have you been?
