WEBVTT

00:08.129 --> 00:09.969
WILL YOU GET OFF THE
COMPUTER, PLEASE?

00:09.970 --> 00:11.971
YOU'VE ALREADY DONE PLENTY
OF RESEARCH ON COLOMBIA.

00:11.972 --> 00:15.095
I CAN'T BELIEVE LENNOX'S
WONDERFUL PROFESSOR, EVITA,

00:15.096 --> 00:16.396
IS TAKING HER THERE
NEXT SEMESTER.

00:16.397 --> 00:17.937
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
HAVE IN COLOMBIA?

00:17.938 --> 00:20.690
REALLY GOOD COFFEE?

00:20.691 --> 00:22.982
YEAH, BUT WHEN YOU ORDER YOUR
ESPRESSO WITH TWO SHOTS,

00:22.983 --> 00:23.984
THEY COME OUT OF A GUN.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.817
HONEY, RELAX, ALL RIGHT?

00:27.818 --> 00:29.949
LOOK, WE HAVE SEVERAL MORE MOVES
LEFT IN THIS CHESS MATCH.

00:29.950 --> 00:31.991
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE'S
GOING THERE FOR SURE YET.

00:31.992 --> 00:33.613
BUT I'LL TELL YOU THIS;
IF YOU GET UPSET,

00:33.614 --> 00:35.034
YOU'RE GONNA PUSH HER
RIGHT INTO EVITA'S ARMS.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.248
UH, IT'S PRONOUNCED,
(exaggerated accent) EVITA.

00:38.869 --> 00:39.790
OH, HEY, HONEY.

00:45.796 --> 00:46.796
DID YOU SEE THAT?

00:46.797 --> 00:49.130
SHE WAS BITING THAT CROISSANT, BUT
SHE WAS REALLY BITING MY HEAD OFF.

00:50.511 --> 00:54.014
DO YOU KNOW, IN COLOMBIA, THEY HAVE SPIDERS
THAT CAN ACTUALLY BITE YOUR HEAD OFF.

00:55.015 --> 00:56.476
YEAH, I DID A LITTLE
GOOGLING MYSELF.

00:56.477 --> 00:57.887
(laughing)

00:57.888 --> 00:58.979
ANYWAY. BACK TO YOU.

01:00.141 --> 01:02.852
THAT PROFESSOR HAS DRIVEN A
WEDGE BETWEEN ME AND LENNOX.

01:02.853 --> 01:03.943
I'VE LOST HER.

01:03.944 --> 01:06.736
YOU KNOW, I BLEW IT WITH MY COMPLETELY
APPROPRIATE REACTION TO HER LITTLE TRIP.

01:06.737 --> 01:09.069
YOU TRIED TO PUT HER
PASSPORT IN THE TOASTER.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.991
LIKE I SAID, COMPLETELY
APPROPRIATE.

01:11.992 --> 01:15.245
WHY DON'T YOU JUST FOCUS ON THINGS
THAT YOU CAN CONTROL, ALL RIGHT?

01:15.246 --> 01:17.157
LIKE YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH LENNOX, YOU KNOW.

01:17.158 --> 01:18.748
NURTURE IT. BOND WITH HER.

01:18.749 --> 01:21.000
SO YOUR DAUGHTER
CALLS YOU DAD ONCE,

01:21.001 --> 01:22.463
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE THE
WIZARD OF PARENTING?

01:23.664 --> 01:24.795
PRETTY MUCH, YEAH.

01:25.916 --> 01:27.917
COME ON, YOU SAW HOW I
HANDLED YESTERDAY, MAN.

01:27.918 --> 01:30.210
I FOUND OUT DANI HAD A LITTLE
WINE-TASTING PARTY AND... BOOM!

01:30.211 --> 01:31.711
I WAS ALL OVER IT.
I TOOK CARE OF IT.

01:31.712 --> 01:33.423
SO, YES, I AM ON A STREAK.

01:33.424 --> 01:36.716
LOOK, NOT TO GET TECHNICAL, BUT ONE
VICTORY DOES NOT MAKE A STREAK.

01:36.717 --> 01:38.559
JUST SAYING, DON'T
BET AGAINST ME.

01:41.101 --> 01:44.854
UM, HEY, I WAS THINKING. YOU KNOW,
YOU'VE STUDIED MORE IN ONE MONTH

01:44.855 --> 01:46.936
THAN I DID MY ENTIRE
SIX YEARS OF COLLEGE.

01:46.937 --> 01:48.568
YOU NEED A LITTLE BREAK.

01:48.569 --> 01:50.440
HOW ABOUT YOU AND I
GO GET OUR NAILS DID?

01:50.441 --> 01:53.443
YOU'RE JUST GONNA TRY TO TALK
ME OUT OF GOING TO COLOMBIA...

01:53.444 --> 01:55.995
NO, I READ THE STATE DEPARTMENT GUIDELINES.
IT SOUNDS REALLY EXCITING.

01:55.996 --> 01:58.578
ESPECIALLY THE PART WHERE THEY SAY,
"NEVER LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE SOLDIERS."

01:58.579 --> 02:00.080
I MEAN, THAT IS GOOD
ADVICE ANYWHERE.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.793
SO, UH, WHAT DO YOU SAY?

02:03.794 --> 02:06.547
YOU KNOW, 3:00 PM AT
THE NAIL SALON, ON ME.

02:08.919 --> 02:10.421
SURE, LET'S DO THAT.

02:16.016 --> 02:17.718
- (door closes)
- NEVER BET AGAINST A STREAK.

02:18.809 --> 02:20.059
(theme music playing)

02:20.060 --> 02:21.931
- ♪ IT'S ALL GOOD ♪

02:41.542 --> 02:43.993
I THOUGHT CANCELING THE CAMPING
TRIP WAS MY PUNISHMENT.

02:43.994 --> 02:45.955
NOW YOU'RE CALLING
TO TELL MY MOM?

02:45.956 --> 02:47.747
SHE NEEDS TO KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON, DAN.

02:47.748 --> 02:50.880
HEY, GUYS, HELP ME OUT. I'M
HAVING A NAIL POLISH CRISIS.

02:50.881 --> 02:53.673
SHOULD I GO SAFE, WITH
PUT A RING ON IT RED,

02:53.674 --> 02:55.595
OR ROLL THE DICE,

02:55.596 --> 02:57.848
WITH TWERKQUOISE.

03:00.971 --> 03:02.972
YOU CAN NOT TELL MY
MOM I DRANK WINE.

03:02.973 --> 03:05.104
SHE'S A TOTAL HARD-ASS
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

03:05.105 --> 03:07.397
WAIT A SECOND, AN ACUPUNCTURIST
WHO TOURS WITH ROCK BANDS

03:07.398 --> 03:08.568
IS A HARD-ASS ABOUT DRINKING?

03:08.569 --> 03:10.069
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY.

03:10.070 --> 03:13.022
SHE'S SEEN THE DAMAGE, AND NOW
SHE HAS A ZERO-TOLERANCE POLICY

03:13.023 --> 03:15.735
ABOUT DRUGS, ALCOHOL...

03:15.736 --> 03:17.658
AND, FOR SOME REASON,
THE JONAS BROTHERS.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.119
FELICIA NEEDS TO
KNOW, ALL RIGHT?

03:20.120 --> 03:21.581
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE ONE TO TELL HER.

03:21.582 --> 03:23.533
WHAT? N-NO, PLEASE.

03:23.534 --> 03:24.825
COME ON, JOE. ISN'T THAT...

03:25.826 --> 03:27.788
A WONDERFUL WAY TO SHOW
YOUR DAUGHTER YOU LOVE HER?

03:30.381 --> 03:31.882
HERE'S YOUR PHONE, HONEY.
DIAL IT.

03:32.883 --> 03:33.883
(stammering)

03:33.884 --> 03:35.885
BUT I THINK I FORGOT THE NUMBER.

03:35.886 --> 03:38.217
YOU DID? LET ME
HELP YOU WITH THAT.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.430
- (beeps)
- DIAL, "MOM."

03:40.431 --> 03:41.642
HERE YOU GO.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.804
UM...

03:44.805 --> 03:45.975
HI, MOM.

03:45.976 --> 03:49.559
YEAH, I'M FINE. I'M CALLING
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

03:49.560 --> 03:52.061
SEE, I HAD SOME
GIRLFRIENDS OVER...

03:52.062 --> 03:54.274
ANYWAY, UM...

03:54.275 --> 03:56.946
THERE WAS SOME WINE THERE,
AND THEY DRANK SOME.

03:56.947 --> 03:59.529
SO I HAD SOME TOO,

03:59.530 --> 04:00.781
TO BE SOCIABLE.

04:03.284 --> 04:05.955
YES, I KNOW I MADE A MISTAKE,
BUT DAD IS HANDLING IT.

04:05.956 --> 04:08.038
(mouthing)

04:10.421 --> 04:11.501
MM-KAY.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.922
SEE YOU WHEN THE TOUR'S OVER.

04:12.923 --> 04:14.295
LOVE YOU. BYE.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.637
SO, HOW DID EVERYTHING GO?

04:17.638 --> 04:20.430
GREAT. SHE WAS GLAD I TOLD HER.

04:20.431 --> 04:21.931
SHE SAID IT SHOWED MATURITY.

04:21.932 --> 04:25.014
YOU SEE, THE LESSON HERE IS
THAT WE'RE A TEAM, ALL RIGHT.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.439
A TEAM THAT ALWAYS DOES
WHAT CAPTAIN DAD SAYS.

04:30.391 --> 04:32.021
I'M HAPPY TO CALL YOU DAD.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.154
JUST PLEASE DON'T MAKE
ME CALL YOU CAPTAIN.

04:35.696 --> 04:36.737
I'M GOOD WITH DAD.

04:40.741 --> 04:42.862
(sighs) AND THE
STREAK CONTINUES.

04:42.863 --> 04:45.114
(chuckles) DON'T FEEL BAD, MEL.

04:45.115 --> 04:47.327
I KNOW PARENTING CAN BE
FRUSTRATING AT TIMES.

04:47.328 --> 04:50.370
ESPECIALLY WHEN I MAKE IT LOOK SO
EASY, BUT, YOU KNOW. (chuckles)

04:50.371 --> 04:51.672
WHAT CAN I DO?

04:52.673 --> 04:54.004
YOU CAN SHUT UP.

04:54.795 --> 04:56.677
(phone ringing)

04:58.088 --> 04:59.420
IT'S FELICIA.

05:00.841 --> 05:02.052
HEY, FELICIA.

05:03.053 --> 05:04.554
WHAT?

05:04.555 --> 05:06.927
(laughs) YES, BUT I REALLY
THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

05:08.058 --> 05:09.849
YES, BUT I REALLY
THINK YOU'RE...

05:09.850 --> 05:11.190
YES, BUT I REALLY THINK...

05:11.191 --> 05:12.772
YES, BUT I...

05:12.773 --> 05:13.934
YES, BUT...

05:15.696 --> 05:16.937
YES.

05:18.238 --> 05:20.401
SO, HOW'D THAT GO, CAPTAIN DAD?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.824
FELICIA JUST QUIT THE TOUR. SHE'S
COMING HERE TO TAKE DANI HOME.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.156
OH, NO! JUST BECAUSE
YOU LET DANI DRINK?

05:27.157 --> 05:28.869
I DIDN'T LET HER DRINK!

05:29.870 --> 05:31.581
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS. I'M
GONNA LOSE MY DAUGHTER.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.583
AND THREE MONTHS EARLIER
THAN WE AGREED ON.

05:33.584 --> 05:35.375
WELL, OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT, JOE?

05:35.376 --> 05:38.458
YOU WERE THE ONE THAT WAS ABLE TO TALK FELICIA
INTO LETTING HER COME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:38.459 --> 05:40.380
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN
GET THAT TIME BACK.

05:40.381 --> 05:42.383
YOU JUST GOTTA USE THAT
FAMOUS LONGO CHARM.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.764
YEAH, I MEAN...

05:44.765 --> 05:45.965
WORKED ON HER BEFORE.

05:45.966 --> 05:47.557
NOT THAT KIND OF CHARM.

05:47.558 --> 05:49.600
THAT'S HOW YOU ENDED UP WITH
A KID IN THE FIRST PLACE.

05:50.931 --> 05:52.682
MMM. YEAH.

05:52.683 --> 05:55.105
I'M GONNA DIAL IT BACK TO 50%.

05:58.148 --> 05:59.439
OKAY, SO I WAS GONNA
GO WITH BLUE,

05:59.440 --> 06:00.980
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, "WHY
NOT GO WITH BLACK?"

06:00.981 --> 06:04.074
BLACK IS SLIMMING. EVERYONE WILL SAY,
"HAVE YOUR FINGERS LOST WEIGHT?"

06:05.365 --> 06:07.156
I WAS THINKING...
WAIT, YOU READY?

06:07.157 --> 06:09.409
POLKA DOTS ON ONE HAND,
STRIPES ON THE OTHER.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.120
- CUTE?
- CUTE?

06:11.121 --> 06:12.542
IT'S GENIUS.

06:12.543 --> 06:14.414
OH, THIS IS SO GREAT.

06:14.415 --> 06:18.207
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE US GIRLS HAVE TAKEN
OUR FINGERS AND TOES ON A MINI VACATION.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.379
(knocking)

06:23.884 --> 06:25.054
- EVITA.
- HI, LENNOX.

06:25.055 --> 06:27.176
HELLO, COUNCILWOMAN.

06:27.177 --> 06:29.008
I JUST FINISHED GOING OVER
THE NOTES YOU TYPED UP.

06:29.009 --> 06:31.511
I NEED SOME REVISIONS AND WONDERED
IF YOU COULD INCORPORATE THEM.

06:31.512 --> 06:32.642
OH, SURE.

06:32.643 --> 06:34.313
YEAH, I'M JUST HEADING
OUT WITH MY AUNT,

06:34.314 --> 06:35.775
BUT AS SOON AS WE GET BACK.

06:35.776 --> 06:37.897
WELL, I WAS HOPING
YOU'D GET RIGHT ON IT.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.439
OH, SORRY, NO CAN DO.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.481
THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT EVENT,
AND IT CANNOT BE RESCHEDULED.

06:41.482 --> 06:43.943
WE'RE GETTING MANI-PEDIS.

06:43.944 --> 06:46.576
YEAH, AT ONE OF THE NICE SALONS, WHERE
YOU HAVE TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

06:46.577 --> 06:48.237
NAIL SALON?

06:48.238 --> 06:49.789
REALLY?

06:49.790 --> 06:51.120
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH THAT?

06:51.121 --> 06:52.582
NO, IT'S JUST...

06:52.583 --> 06:54.914
OPPRESSED WOMEN
KNEELING AT YOUR FEET,

06:54.915 --> 06:58.838
INHALING TOXIC FUMES ALL DAY, ALL SO
YOU CAN LOOK LIKE A PAINTED DOLL.

06:58.839 --> 07:01.841
UH, THEY WERE MASKS, AND THEY MASSAGE
YOUR HANDS AND TELL YOU YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

07:01.842 --> 07:04.004
WHO ELSE DOES THAT? NO ONE.

07:05.005 --> 07:06.636
LENNOX, I HAVE TO SAY,

07:06.637 --> 07:09.929
I'M SURPRISED YOU'D BUY IN
TO SUCH A CLASSIST RITUAL.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.011
YOUR FOOT IS IN THE
HANDS OF THESE WOMEN,

07:12.012 --> 07:13.763
BUT YOU'RE REALLY
STEPPING ON THEIR HEADS,

07:13.764 --> 07:15.055
KEEPING THEM DOWN.

07:16.056 --> 07:17.857
WOW.

07:17.858 --> 07:20.940
YEAH, I GUESS I NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT IT LIKE THAT.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.233
MAYBE THE NAIL SALON'S
NOT SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

07:24.865 --> 07:26.947
OKAY, PROFESSOR BUZZKILL.

07:27.988 --> 07:28.988
LET'S PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE.

07:28.989 --> 07:30.830
I WANT TO TAKE MY NIECE
TO THE NAIL SALON.

07:30.831 --> 07:32.241
OOH, SCARY.

07:32.242 --> 07:35.374
YOU WANT TO FLY HER TO
THE JUNGLES OF COLOMBIA

07:35.375 --> 07:38.167
TO CHILLAX WITH MACHINE
GUN-TOTING DRUG LORDS.

07:38.168 --> 07:40.419
WHICH ONE'S WORSE. LET ME THINK.

07:40.420 --> 07:42.882
ON ONE HAND, YOU COULD WIND
UP WITH A LITTLE FOOT FUNGUS.

07:42.883 --> 07:45.135
ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU COULD
WIND UP A LITTLE DEAD.

07:46.847 --> 07:48.588
YEAH, SURE, I MAY
BE A NARCISSIST,

07:48.589 --> 07:50.890
BUT YOU, PROFESSOR, ARE A
SELF-IMPORTANT WINDBAG.

07:50.891 --> 07:52.181
AND WHAT'S MORE,

07:52.182 --> 07:53.854
(blows raspberry)

07:57.688 --> 07:58.768
WELL...

07:58.769 --> 08:00.019
CAN'T ARGUE WITH THAT.

08:00.020 --> 08:02.441
EMAIL ME THE FINISHED
DOC WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

08:02.442 --> 08:04.564
WILL DO.

08:04.565 --> 08:05.815
SO...

08:05.816 --> 08:07.486
LET'S GO GET US SOME HAPPY FEET.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.158
YOU JUST HUMILIATED ME,

08:09.159 --> 08:11.531
AND INSULTED SOMEONE I
RESPECT A GREAT DEAL.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.873
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU.

08:13.824 --> 08:15.455
I THOUGHT I MADE SOME
REALLY GOOD POINTS.

08:16.456 --> 08:17.918
BEFORE THE... (blows raspberry)

08:24.004 --> 08:27.176
FELICIA! HOW DO YOU GET OFF A PLANE
AND STILL LOOK FRESH AS A DAISY?

08:27.177 --> 08:30.680
DANI IS LEAVING TODAY, JOE. THIS
IS NOT OPEN FOR NEGOTIATION,

08:30.681 --> 08:32.802
AND DON'T TRY TO PULL
OUT THAT LONGO CHARM.

08:32.803 --> 08:34.094
WHOA, HEY. I'M NOT GONNA
PULL ANYTHING OUT.

08:35.636 --> 08:37.137
NO, I RESPECT YOU WAY
TOO MUCH FOR THAT.

08:39.479 --> 08:41.350
LOOK, UM, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST, YOU KNOW,

08:41.351 --> 08:42.982
STAY HERE FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS,

08:42.983 --> 08:45.855
AND YOU'LL SEE THIS IS REALLY
A GREAT ENVIRONMENT FOR DANI.

08:45.856 --> 08:47.857
HUH. OH.

08:47.858 --> 08:49.949
SO YOUR IDEA OF A
GREAT ENVIRONMENT

08:49.950 --> 08:52.411
IS AN OPEN BAR FOR 13-YEAR-OLDS?

08:52.412 --> 08:54.203
LET'S NOT FIGHT, OKAY?

08:54.204 --> 08:56.746
LOOK, WE MADE A DEAL. DANI WAS SUPPOSED
TO STAY HERE FOR THREE MORE MONTHS

08:56.747 --> 08:58.457
TO GET TO KNOW HER DAD. I
THINK WE SHOULD STICK TO IT.

08:58.458 --> 08:59.789
SHE'S LEAVING,

08:59.790 --> 09:01.120
WITH ME, TODAY.

09:01.121 --> 09:03.213
TWO MONTHS. TWO MONTHS
IS MORE THAN FAIR.

09:04.544 --> 09:05.875
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, JOE.

09:05.876 --> 09:08.087
I DO NEED SOME TIME TO
GO TO DANI'S SCHOOL.

09:08.088 --> 09:11.131
I'VE GOT TO GET HER ASSIGNMENTS. I
NEED TO START THE TRANSFER PAPERWORK,

09:12.132 --> 09:13.803
SO WE'LL LEAVE ON THURSDAY.

09:13.804 --> 09:14.884
THAT'S 48 HOURS.

09:14.885 --> 09:16.095
72 HOURS?

09:16.096 --> 09:17.346
24 HOURS.

09:17.347 --> 09:19.058
OH, COME ON. WILL YOU
BE REASONABLE, FELICIA?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.980
- 23 HOURS. -WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME JUST...
HOLD ON...

09:20.981 --> 09:22.942
- 22, 21...
- STOP IT.

09:22.943 --> 09:25.895
48 HOURS, ALL RIGHT? 48...
THAT'S MY FINAL OFFER.

09:25.896 --> 09:27.106
SO YOU BETTER TAKE IT.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.238
OKAY.

09:31.111 --> 09:32.191
SO, WHERE'S FELICIA?

09:32.192 --> 09:33.863
OH, YOU JUST MISSED HER.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.284
AND SHE TOOK DANI?

09:35.285 --> 09:38.958
OH, NO! MY HUSBAND'S DAUGHTER IS TAKEN
AWAY, AND I'M AT THE NAIL SALON.

09:38.959 --> 09:41.041
EVITA'S RIGHT. I AM NARCISSIST.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.003
NO, DANI'S STILL HERE, HONEY.
SHE'S AT BAND PRACTICE.

09:44.004 --> 09:45.705
OH, THANK GOODNESS.

09:45.706 --> 09:47.838
SO, WHAT DO YOU THINK?
CUTE, RIGHT?

09:48.799 --> 09:50.169
YES, VERY.

09:50.170 --> 09:52.842
SO I MANAGED TO SQUEEZE 48 HOURS
WITH DANI OUT OF FELICIA.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.383
TWO DAYS? THAT'S NOT MUCH.

09:54.384 --> 09:56.175
I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN
LONGO'S GET HANDED LEMONS,

09:56.176 --> 09:57.426
WE TURN IT INTO LEMONADE.

09:57.427 --> 10:00.060
WHEN BURKES GET HANDED LEMONS, WE
USE THEM TO GARNISH OUR MARTINIS.

10:01.481 --> 10:04.353
ANYWAY, I MADE A LIST OF EVERYTHING
THAT A FATHER NEEDS TO TEACH A DAUGHTER

10:04.354 --> 10:05.935
AND I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO
IT IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS,

10:05.936 --> 10:08.858
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHEN FELICIA
IS GONNA LET ME SEE DANI AGAIN.

10:08.859 --> 10:10.820
"HOW TO PLAY POKER.
HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE.

10:10.821 --> 10:13.362
HOW TO HOT-WIRE A CAR."

10:13.363 --> 10:15.865
I HAD A BOYFRIEND IN COLLEGE ONCE
THAT COULD OPEN A BEER BOTTLE

10:15.866 --> 10:16.907
WITH HIS EYE SOCKET.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.950
YEAH, I'M NOT SURE IF I'M GONNA
HAVE TIME TO GET TO THAT ONE.

10:20.951 --> 10:23.292
BUT I HAVE TO TEACH HER HOW TO DEFEND
HERSELF, HOW TO SPOT A PLAYER.

10:23.293 --> 10:25.665
THE POINT IS, I'M GONNA BE CRAZY BUSY
WITH DANI FOR THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.456
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PLENTY
OF TIME TO BOND WITH LENNOX.

10:27.457 --> 10:29.709
YEAH, EXCEPT LENNOX WANTS
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

10:29.710 --> 10:31.590
AFTER I WENT OFF ON EVITA.

10:31.591 --> 10:32.592
NOT MY BEST MOVE.

10:33.593 --> 10:35.424
WELL, I BETTER GO UPSTAIRS

10:35.425 --> 10:37.136
AND ADMIT TO LENNOX I WAS WRONG.

10:37.137 --> 10:38.758
WHAT?

10:38.759 --> 10:39.929
YOU REALLY THINK YOU WERE WRONG?

10:39.930 --> 10:42.311
NO, BUT I'M OUT OF BULLETS.

10:42.312 --> 10:43.973
AND YOU KNOW WHO'S
NOT OUT OF BULLETS?

10:43.974 --> 10:45.185
THE COLOMBIAN DRUG LORDS.

10:50.440 --> 10:51.941
KNOCK, KNOCK. GOT A MINUTE?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.032
GO AWAY.

10:53.033 --> 10:55.114
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO BE SUPPORTIVE
OF THIS DECISION OF YOURS

10:55.115 --> 10:57.867
TO GO TO COLOMBIA WITH EVITA.

10:57.868 --> 11:00.329
SO I GOT YOU THIS HANDY
SPANISH PHRASE BOOK.

11:00.330 --> 11:03.993
YEAH, IT HAS ALL THE USEFUL
PHRASES FOR TOURISTS.

11:03.994 --> 11:05.745
"WHERE'S THE BATHROOM?"
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

11:05.746 --> 11:07.837
"I'LL HAVE BOTTLED WATER." MMM.

11:07.838 --> 11:08.958
OOH, HERE'S A BIGGIE.

11:08.959 --> 11:11.381
"MY COUNTRY WILL PAY
HANDSOMELY FOR MY RETURN."

11:12.843 --> 11:13.883
AUNT MEL, YOU MADE THAT UP.

11:13.884 --> 11:17.506
HEY, YOU'RE GOING TO A PLACE WHERE
THAT'S A PHRASE YOU HAVE TO LEARN.

11:17.507 --> 11:19.008
THANKS TO, (exaggerated
accent) EVITA.

11:19.009 --> 11:21.300
OKAY, SERIOUSLY? STOP
CALLING HER THAT.

11:21.301 --> 11:22.893
(sighs) FINE.

11:26.897 --> 11:27.977
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:27.978 --> 11:31.020
I'M JUST REMEMBERING YOUR FACE,

11:31.021 --> 11:34.113
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, I MIGHT
NEVER SEE IT AGAIN.

11:34.114 --> 11:37.076
OKAY, LET ME SEE THIS BOOK.

11:37.077 --> 11:39.779
OH, HERE'S A USEFUL
COLOMBIAN EXPRESSION.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.530
OH, I HOPE I'M PRONOUNCING
IT CORRECTLY.

11:41.531 --> 11:43.492
GO AWAY.

11:43.493 --> 11:46.206
- IT'S PRONOUNCED, ADIOS.
- GO AWAY!

11:49.249 --> 11:50.830
HOW MANY CARDS DO YOU WANT?

11:50.831 --> 11:52.922
- ONE?
- WHOA, OKAY.

11:52.923 --> 11:55.384
IN POKER, YOU NEVER SAY
ANYTHING WITH A QUESTION MARK.

11:55.385 --> 11:57.507
ALL RIGHT? IT'S JUST LIKE LIFE.
YOU GOTTA LEAD WITH CONFIDENCE.

11:58.839 --> 11:59.839
GIVE ME ONE.

11:59.840 --> 12:00.971
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT.

12:03.683 --> 12:04.975
HOW DO WE DO?

12:05.896 --> 12:07.938
- FLUSH.
- NOW THAT'S POKER.

12:09.519 --> 12:11.480
THANKS. I'M GOING TO BED.

12:11.481 --> 12:12.852
NO, NO, NO. YOU'RE NOT.

12:12.853 --> 12:15.985
WELL, WE'VE BEEN AT THIS LIFE
SKILL STUFF FOR FIVE HOURS.

12:15.986 --> 12:17.486
YES, EXACTLY.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.158
NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAD
OUT INTO THE DRIVEWAY,

12:19.159 --> 12:20.820
AND I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
HOW TO CHANGE A TIRE.

12:20.821 --> 12:23.282
BUT I'M GONNA GET
GREASE ON MY PAJAMAS.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.165
NOT IF YOU DO IT THE
RIGHT WAY, SWEETIE.

12:34.795 --> 12:38.007
ADMIT IT. PROOFING MY PAPER
IS MUCH MORE FULFILLING

12:38.008 --> 12:39.929
THAN A TRIP TO THE NAIL SALON.

12:39.930 --> 12:40.970
IT IS.

12:40.971 --> 12:42.802
ALTHOUGH, EVERY TIME I HIT SEND

12:42.803 --> 12:45.184
I NOTICE MISS PINKY WAS
LOOKING A TAD HUMDRUM.

12:45.185 --> 12:46.846
(laughing)

12:46.847 --> 12:48.018
JUST A LITTLE LEVITY.

12:49.519 --> 12:51.520
I'M HAVING A BRAINSTORM.

12:51.521 --> 12:54.854
WHY NOT HELP OTHER WOMEN MAKE THE
SAME ENLIGHTENED DECISION YOU DID?

12:54.855 --> 12:57.316
WE COULD SET UP AN
EDUCATION STATION

12:57.317 --> 12:59.738
IN FRONT OF THAT NAIL
SALON YOUR AUNT GOES TO,

12:59.739 --> 13:02.161
AND TEACH IGNORANT WOMEN
ABOUT CLASS OPPRESSION.

13:02.162 --> 13:03.903
YES.

13:03.904 --> 13:05.204
THAT COULD REALLY
RAISE AWARENESS.

13:05.205 --> 13:06.495
RAISE AWARENESS?

13:06.496 --> 13:09.578
IF WE DO THIS RIGHT, WE COULD
PUT THAT PLACE OUT OF BUSINESS.

13:09.579 --> 13:11.370
OH, I AM GOOD.

13:11.371 --> 13:15.124
OH, BUT WAIT, IF WE DO THAT, THE WOMEN
WHO WORK THERE WILL LOSE THEIR JOBS.

13:15.125 --> 13:16.545
COLLATERAL DAMAGE.

13:16.546 --> 13:17.918
ACCEPTABLE LOSSES FOR THE CAUSE.

13:19.970 --> 13:22.301
THEY'RE NOT LOSSES, EVITA.
THEY'RE PEOPLE.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.884
OH, LENNOX, YOU HAVE
SO MUCH TO UNLEARN.

13:24.885 --> 13:28.057
I CAN STILL HEAR THE
RINSE AND SPIN CYCLE

13:28.058 --> 13:30.519
OF YOUR AUNT'S SOCIOPATHIC
BRAINWASHING.

13:30.520 --> 13:33.192
OKAY, IS THIS ABOUT WORKERS
RIGHTS OR MY AUNT?

13:33.193 --> 13:36.025
YOUR AUNT IS THE ONE
SELFISHLY TRYING TO KEEP YOU

13:36.026 --> 13:37.737
FROM GOING TO (exaggerated
accent) COLOMBIA.

13:38.939 --> 13:40.359
SHE MAY NOT BE PERFECT,

13:40.360 --> 13:43.442
BUT MY AUNT FILIBUSTERED
CITY COUNCIL FOR TWO DAYS

13:43.443 --> 13:46.906
TO OPEN EXTRA HOMELESS SHELTERS
DURING THE LAST BLIZZARD.

13:46.907 --> 13:48.287
OKAY, MY AUNT CARES
ABOUT PEOPLE.

13:48.288 --> 13:49.870
I CARE ABOUT PROGRESS.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.623
WELL, I THINK I'D RATHER
CARE ABOUT PEOPLE.

13:54.624 --> 13:56.006
(exaggerated accent) EVITA.

13:59.669 --> 14:01.260
YEAH, I DON'T FEEL ANY
PRESSURE AT ALL ON MY ELBOW.

14:01.261 --> 14:03.802
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT
TO BREAK YOUR ASSAILANT'S ARM, HONEY.

14:03.803 --> 14:06.135
I'M TIRED AND I'M HUNGRY.

14:06.136 --> 14:07.846
WHEN YOU WOKE ME UP, YOU
PROMISED ME PANCAKES.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.309
PANCAKES ARE FOR KILLERS.
ALL RIGHT?

14:10.310 --> 14:12.471
BESIDES, YOU GOT PLENTY
OF SLEEP LAST NIGHT.

14:12.472 --> 14:14.353
THREE HOURS!

14:14.354 --> 14:15.524
THAT'S IT, I'M
GOING BACK TO BED,

14:15.525 --> 14:17.066
AND DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT WAKING ME UP.

14:17.067 --> 14:20.189
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME LEFT, HONEY,
BEFORE YOUR MOM COMES TO TAKE YOU HOME.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.981
- GOOD MORNING.
- GOOD NIGHT.

14:21.982 --> 14:25.695
WE HAVEN'T EVEN GONE OVER FRANK
SINATRA VERSUS TONY BENNETT YET!

14:26.826 --> 14:28.077
WHY IS SHE SO UPSET?

14:28.078 --> 14:30.659
OH, BECAUSE I PROMISED HER PANCAKES
IF SHE COULD BREAK MY ARM.

14:30.660 --> 14:31.951
OOH, I'LL TAKE THAT DEAL.
GIVE ME THAT ARM.

14:31.952 --> 14:33.993
NO! GET AWAY FROM ME.

14:33.994 --> 14:35.955
I'M TRYING TO TEACH HER EVERYTHING
SHE'S GONNA NEED TO KNOW

14:35.956 --> 14:37.917
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE,
AND SHE DIDN'T WANT IT.

14:37.918 --> 14:40.259
WELL, JOE, SHE ONLY REACTED
THAT WAY BECAUSE SHE'S 13.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.421
DON'T WORRY, THAT ATTITUDE USUALLY
GOES AWAY BY THE TIME SHE'S...

14:42.422 --> 14:45.095
WELL, PROBABLY NEVER, BECAUSE
LENNOX IS STILL DOING IT TO ME.

14:46.096 --> 14:48.557
SHE'S STILL DOING IT? I THOUGHT YOU
WERE SMOOTHING THINGS OVER WITH HER?

14:48.558 --> 14:49.678
WELL, I TRIED,

14:49.679 --> 14:52.352
BUT SHE WAS IRRITATED BY MY
INSISTENCE THAT SHE NOT DIE.

14:53.773 --> 14:55.514
(sighs) LOOK, HONEY,
IF ALL ELSE FAILS,

14:55.515 --> 14:58.317
A TRIED AND TRUE WAY TO MAKE A WOMAN
WHO'S TRULY UPSET FEEL BETTER

14:58.318 --> 14:59.979
IS TO TELL HER HOW
NICE HER HAIR LOOKS.

14:59.980 --> 15:02.651
- THAT'S YOUR ADVICE?
- IT WORKS EVERY TIME.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.945
THAT'S STUPID AND CONDESCENDING.
THAT WOULD NEVER WORK ON ME.

15:06.076 --> 15:07.786
WELL, IF COURSE IT WOULDN'T
WORK ON YOU, HONEY,

15:07.787 --> 15:09.789
BECAUSE YOU'RE WAY TOO SMART AND
BEAUTIFUL TO FALL FOR THAT.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.292
I AM.

15:13.333 --> 15:15.624
AND IF YOU'RE SUCH A
WIZARD AT PARENTING,

15:15.625 --> 15:18.457
HOW COME YOUR DAUGHTER JUST
STORMED AWAY, ANGRY AT YOU?

15:18.458 --> 15:20.749
BECAUSE THIS IS AN ODD CASE. I'M
TRYING TO CRAM IT ALL IN THERE

15:20.750 --> 15:23.633
IN THE NEXT 48 HOURS,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW...

15:24.884 --> 15:26.595
I DON'T KNOW IF I'M EVER
GONNA SEE HER AGAIN.

15:26.596 --> 15:28.887
WHAT? JOE, AREN'T YOU
OVERREACTING A LITTLE?

15:28.888 --> 15:31.810
NO, I'M NOT. LOOK, FELICIA
HAS FULL CUSTODY OVER DANI.

15:31.811 --> 15:33.552
SHE COULD KEEP HER AWAY
FROM ME UNTIL SHE'S 18,

15:33.553 --> 15:35.934
AND BY THAT POINT, YOU
KNOW, IT'LL BE TOO LATE.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.727
WELL, DOES DANI KNOW WHY YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE SUCH A CRAZY MAN?

15:38.728 --> 15:40.610
I MEAN, BEING SUCH
A GOOD FATHER?

15:41.821 --> 15:43.902
I WAS GONNA TELL HER, BUT I'M
AFRAID IT WILL SCARE HER.

15:43.903 --> 15:47.066
YOU KNOW, I THINK TELLING HER
MIGHT SCARE HER A LITTLE LESS

15:47.067 --> 15:48.737
THAN WAKING HER UP IN THE
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

15:48.738 --> 15:49.949
PRETENDING YOU'RE A MUGGER.

15:50.991 --> 15:52.072
THAT WORKS.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.999
OH, HONEY, I HAVE TO SAY...

16:00.000 --> 16:00.920
YOUR HAIR LOOKS...

16:02.172 --> 16:03.253
REALLY NICE.

16:05.005 --> 16:05.925
OH!

16:05.926 --> 16:08.007
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, AUNT MEL.
YOU WERE SO RIGHT.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.428
I'M NOT GONNA BE A
SOCIOLOGY MAJOR

16:09.429 --> 16:10.719
AND I AM NOT GOING TO COLOMBIA.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.721
I JUST KINDA GOT A LITTLE
SWEPT UP WITH EVITA,

16:12.722 --> 16:13.932
BUT I AM SO DONE WITH HER.

16:13.933 --> 16:15.555
I JUST WANT TO STAY
RIGHT HERE WITH YOU.

16:16.516 --> 16:18.187
OH, MAYBE LATER WE COULD
GO GET OUR NAILS DONE.

16:18.188 --> 16:19.479
OKAY.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.652
OH! I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU.

16:23.773 --> 16:24.814
BYE.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.369
JOE IS A MAGICIAN.

16:32.322 --> 16:33.613
(doorbell rings)

16:37.957 --> 16:39.328
FELICIA, WE MEET AGAIN.

16:39.329 --> 16:40.879
I'M A LITTLE BIT EARLY.
IS DANI READY?

16:40.880 --> 16:42.832
YEAH, UM, LOOK.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.965
I KNOW IT'S NOT MY PLACE, BUT I
THINK YOU'RE MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE

16:46.966 --> 16:48.627
TAKING DANI AWAY FROM
A WONDERFUL FATHER.

16:48.628 --> 16:50.259
FOR THE PAST 48 HOURS,

16:50.260 --> 16:52.681
JOE HAS BEEN TEACHING HER PRETTY
MUCH EVERYTHING HE KNOWS.

16:52.682 --> 16:55.304
SHE IS GONNA BE PREPARED FOR
WHATEVER LIFE THROWS AT HER.

16:55.305 --> 16:56.975
I'M NOT CHANGING MY MIND, MEL.

16:56.976 --> 16:58.768
YOUR HAIR LOOKS REALLY NICE.

16:59.769 --> 17:00.849
REALLY NICE.

17:00.850 --> 17:02.902
ARE YOU HITTING ON ME?

17:04.524 --> 17:05.735
THEY'RE IN THE KITCHEN.

17:07.947 --> 17:10.409
THAT'S WHY YOU NEVER USE A DEBIT
CARD AT A GAS STATION, HONEY.

17:10.410 --> 17:11.741
Joe: OR THE BATHROOM.

17:12.782 --> 17:15.495
CAN YOU JUST GIVE
THEM ONE MORE MINUTE?

17:17.827 --> 17:19.578
I'M SORRY IF I WAS SNIPPY,

17:19.579 --> 17:22.462
BUT INSTEAD OF SURVIVAL LESSONS, I WANTED
TO HAVE FUN WITH YOU BEFORE I LEFT.

17:23.463 --> 17:25.794
I KNOW. I WAS JUST...

17:25.795 --> 17:27.796
SCARED THAT WHEN YOUR
MOM TOOK YOU HOME,

17:27.797 --> 17:29.429
I WASN'T GONNA BE ABLE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:31.091 --> 17:32.631
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GET
TO SEE ME AGAIN?

17:32.632 --> 17:34.012
YOUR MY FATHER.

17:34.013 --> 17:35.345
YEAH, BUT IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

17:37.387 --> 17:38.767
YOU'RE REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT THAT?

17:38.768 --> 17:41.441
I'M SCARED TO DEATH I'M
NOT GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

17:42.942 --> 17:44.143
Dani: WELL...

17:44.144 --> 17:45.895
HERE'S SOMETHING THAT
MIGHT HELP YOU SURVIVE.

17:46.946 --> 17:48.607
DAD...

17:48.608 --> 17:49.819
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

17:54.864 --> 17:56.115
AND I PROMISE...

17:56.116 --> 17:57.616
I'LL DIVERSIFY MY ASSETS

17:57.617 --> 18:00.660
AND NEVER HAVE MORE THAN 20%
IN INTERNATIONAL STOCKS.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.125
THAT'S MY GIRL.

18:07.707 --> 18:08.917
DANI, YOUR MOM IS HERE.

18:08.918 --> 18:11.551
- MOM, HI!
- HEY.

18:14.013 --> 18:15.844
SO, I GUESS...

18:15.845 --> 18:17.426
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE DANI HOME, EH.

18:17.427 --> 18:19.849
UH, NOT NECESSARILY.

18:21.431 --> 18:22.721
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"NOT NECESSARILY"?

18:22.722 --> 18:26.395
WHEN I SAID THAT I WAS TAKING DANI
HOME, I DIDN'T MEAN IMMEDIATELY.

18:26.396 --> 18:27.816
YOU SAID 48 HOURS.

18:27.817 --> 18:29.438
WELL, I DIDN'T SAY
WHEN THEY WOULD START.

18:29.439 --> 18:30.649
YOU WERE COUNTING DOWN.

18:30.650 --> 18:33.402
JOE, TAKE YES FOR AN ANSWER.

18:33.403 --> 18:35.494
I... RIGHT.

18:35.495 --> 18:37.446
HEY, SO...

18:37.447 --> 18:39.868
JUST SO I'M CLEAR, DOES THIS MEAN THAT
WE'RE GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DEAL?

18:39.869 --> 18:41.241
SHE CAN STAY HERE FOR
THREE MORE MONTHS?

18:42.242 --> 18:44.624
YES. THE ORIGINAL DEAL.

18:45.915 --> 18:47.746
SO, STAY FOR DINNER.

18:47.747 --> 18:50.169
JOE AND DANI MADE A LASAGNA
LAST NIGHT AT MIDNIGHT.

18:50.170 --> 18:51.420
I'LL JUST THROW IT
IN THE MICROWAVE.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.551
Joe and Dani: NO!

18:52.552 --> 18:54.012
YOU DON'T MICROWAVE LASAGNA.

18:54.013 --> 18:54.924
WHAT SHE SAID.

18:56.176 --> 18:58.388
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA GET BACK
ON THE ROAD TO FORT WAYNE.

18:59.349 --> 19:01.180
WHAT ABOUT THE TOUR?

19:01.181 --> 19:02.312
I QUIT THE TOUR.

19:03.353 --> 19:04.763
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE
HOME, ALL ALONE?

19:04.764 --> 19:06.475
(sighs)

19:06.476 --> 19:08.688
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'VE BEEN ALONE BEFORE.

19:09.689 --> 19:11.029
YOU JUST LISTEN TO YOUR DAD,

19:11.030 --> 19:13.982
AND I WANT YOU TO CALL ME.

19:13.983 --> 19:14.984
ANY TIME.

19:18.328 --> 19:19.699
IT'S NOTHING. IT'S... (sobbing)

19:20.830 --> 19:22.201
IT'S JUST MY ALLERGIES.

19:22.202 --> 19:23.873
I AM TOTALLY FINE.

19:25.585 --> 19:27.786
I'M GONNA FIX MY FACE, AND
THEN I'M JUST GONNA...

19:27.787 --> 19:28.838
I'M GONNA GET ON THE ROAD.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.381
I'M GONNA GO LOOK AFTER FELICIA.

19:32.382 --> 19:34.052
AND BY LOOK AFTER HER,

19:34.053 --> 19:36.506
I MEAN, I'M GONNA MAKE SURE SHE DOESN'T
CRY MASCARA ALL OVER MY COUCH.

19:38.798 --> 19:40.430
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS
GONNA BE ALL ALONE.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.972
MY MOM WOULD NEVER
ADMIT IT, BUT...

19:43.973 --> 19:45.305
SHE'LL BE REALLY LONELY.

19:47.357 --> 19:50.650
BESIDES, IT'S LIKE WE'VE
BEEN PARTNERS FOR 13 YEARS.

19:51.651 --> 19:52.812
I'D KINDA MISS HER.

19:53.813 --> 19:55.073
DON'T TELL HER THAT.

19:55.074 --> 19:56.315
(scoffs)

19:56.316 --> 19:57.367
YOUR SECRET'S SAFE WITH ME.

19:58.948 --> 20:00.078
SO...

20:00.079 --> 20:01.531
IF IT'S COOL WITH YOU...

20:02.532 --> 20:03.623
CAN I GO HOME WITH HER?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.957
YEAH.

20:08.958 --> 20:10.208
YEP.

20:10.209 --> 20:13.001
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA... WE'RE
GONNA SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN SOON.

20:13.002 --> 20:14.793
YEAH, LIKE SPRING BREAK.

20:14.794 --> 20:15.964
HEY, YES. YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:15.965 --> 20:18.257
WE CAN GO ON THAT CAMPING
TRIP THEN IF YOU WANT.

20:18.258 --> 20:19.968
OR I COULD JUST HANG HERE.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.431
YOU KNOW, PLAY POKER, BREAK
EACH OTHER'S ELBOWS.

20:22.432 --> 20:24.052
OH...

20:24.053 --> 20:25.144
I'D LIKE THAT.

20:30.850 --> 20:32.942
- BYE, DANI. BYE, FELICIA.

20:33.943 --> 20:36.275
I LOVE YOU, DANI. CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET HOME, OKAY?

20:36.276 --> 20:37.656
HEY, AND REMEMBER;

20:37.657 --> 20:38.988
NEVER BUY MILK AT LIQUOR STORES.

20:40.159 --> 20:42.160
SO HOW ARE THINGS
WITH YOU AND LENNOX?

20:42.161 --> 20:43.702
OH, YOU'RE NEVER GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS,

20:43.703 --> 20:45.744
BUT THE ADVICE YOU GAVE
ME TOTALLY WORKED.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.956
WHY WOULD I NOT BELIEVE THAT?
IT WAS MY ADVICE.

20:47.957 --> 20:50.168
NOT ONLY ARE LENNOX
AND I ON GOOD TERMS,

20:50.169 --> 20:53.001
BUT SHE CANCELED THAT
STUPID TRIP TO COLOMBIA.

20:53.002 --> 20:53.873
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU.

20:55.134 --> 20:56.675
YEAH, YOU DO.

20:56.676 --> 20:58.337

20:58.338 --> 20:59.718
WELL...

20:59.719 --> 21:00.840

21:01.841 --> 21:03.432
YOU'RE GONNA RINSE...

21:03.433 --> 21:05.594
YOUR DISHES OFF EVERY TIME BEFORE
YOU PUT THEM IN THE DISHWASHER.

21:05.595 --> 21:06.975
OH, MAN.

21:06.976 --> 21:08.767
COME HERE.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.148
- YOU WANT TO GO UPSTAIRS?
- I DO.

21:10.149 --> 21:12.481
I THINK WE DESERVE SOME FUN TIME
AFTER ALL THAT HARDCORE PARENTING.

21:12.482 --> 21:13.522
OOH, YES WE DO.

21:13.523 --> 21:15.153
I'M GONNA GRAB A BOTTLE
OF WINE FROM THE KITCHEN.

21:15.154 --> 21:16.655

21:16.656 --> 21:17.776
AND IN THE HAMPER,

21:17.777 --> 21:19.568
AND IN THE NIGHTSTAND.

21:19.569 --> 21:20.780

READY FOR ROMANCE.

21:22.742 --> 21:24.283
HOW MUCH ALCOHOL DO YOU
NEED TO HAVE SEX WITH ME?
