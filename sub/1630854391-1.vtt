WEBVTT

01:32.159 --> 01:33.526
I'm gonna go.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.774
Put the money in the bag.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.029
You motherfucking...

02:36.057 --> 02:36.891
No!

03:00.881 --> 03:01.882
Oh shit!

03:13.361 --> 03:15.129
Aaah!

03:35.116 --> 03:38.085
- Freeze, motherfucker! Freeze!
- Freeze, motherfucker!

03:38.185 --> 03:39.453
Get on the ground!

03:39.552 --> 03:40.955
Get on the ground!

03:42.622 --> 03:45.192
Take that fucking mask off
your fucking face,

03:45.292 --> 03:46.160
motherfucker, now!

03:46.260 --> 03:47.862
Take it off now!

03:49.196 --> 03:52.433
Slowly, slowly, slowly.

04:12.053 --> 04:15.789
Mr. Terry Lamont Savage.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.626
African-American,

04:19.726 --> 04:21.195
born in Atlanta,

04:21.295 --> 04:23.630
straight from high school
into the Marines.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.733
Quickly promoted to Sergeant,

04:27.835 --> 04:30.471
Special Ops Eclipse Unit.

04:30.570 --> 04:32.239
Nice.

04:32.339 --> 04:36.776
Silver Star in Afghanistan,
Soldier's Medal in Iraq,

04:37.610 --> 04:40.613
and a Medal of Honor for your
work in Nigeria.

04:40.713 --> 04:41.581
You're a--

04:43.184 --> 04:45.286
You're a goddamn real life
war hero!

04:47.188 --> 04:48.155
Who are you?

04:50.590 --> 04:53.194
I'm Police Commissioner
Harvey Clarke.

04:54.428 --> 04:55.896
Now, what's a war hero
like you

04:55.996 --> 04:59.066
doing robbing drug houses
in my city?

05:00.167 --> 05:02.470
Hmm?
No answer?

05:02.570 --> 05:03.703
Interesting.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.372
What happened to you,
war hero?

05:06.240 --> 05:09.243
You've thrown away your
entire military career

05:09.343 --> 05:10.578
for a life of crime?

05:10.677 --> 05:12.712
What if I was thrown away?

05:13.780 --> 05:15.682
I served my country,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.384
I come home,

05:18.385 --> 05:21.522
I can't afford medicine, food,

05:21.621 --> 05:24.058
I'm living in
the fucking projects.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.932
What if I told you,
that I could help you?

05:32.933 --> 05:35.735
We could help each other
really.

05:35.836 --> 05:39.974
You see there's this prison on
the outskirts of downtown.

05:40.074 --> 05:43.310
Degnan Correctional Institute.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.713
It's one of those
corporate-backed private prisons

05:46.814 --> 05:50.818
that are propped up by
closeted Republicans,

05:50.918 --> 05:53.354
you know who are supporting
Wall Street goons.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.788
But that's not the point.

05:55.890 --> 06:00.161
There's this Warden there
and he thinks he's God.

06:01.896 --> 06:04.331
No one but trusted employees
and prisoners

06:04.431 --> 06:06.133
are allowed inside.

06:06.233 --> 06:10.404
And it is rumored that a lot of
his guards are ex-military,

06:11.738 --> 06:14.942
hired directly
by the Warden himself.

06:16.443 --> 06:19.947
I want you to go inside.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.016
Put your eyes on the place,

06:23.050 --> 06:26.753
find me some evidence of
human rights violations,

06:26.854 --> 06:28.856
corruption.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.892
Anything you can get
your hands on that I can use

06:31.992 --> 06:34.895
to put that motherfucker down.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.138
Go fuck yourself.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.873
Go fuck yourself!

06:45.973 --> 06:47.608
Now you see I could do that.

06:47.707 --> 06:50.611
Sit down,
sit down.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.547
You're still facing 10 years
hard time

06:53.647 --> 06:56.016
regardless for armed robbery.

06:56.116 --> 06:58.185
Now you could do 10 years
in the state pen,

06:58.285 --> 07:01.822
or you could go inside Degnan
and get me what I need.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.058
And I will set you free.

07:05.693 --> 07:06.660
You hear me?

07:06.759 --> 07:09.330
Free.
Time served.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.468
Do it for your daughter.

07:25.913 --> 07:28.649
She's-- she's got blood--

07:28.748 --> 07:29.683
Blood clots.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.987
And they-- and--

07:34.054 --> 07:36.056
Do you-- do you understand
that?

07:39.927 --> 07:41.761
So what's your answer?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.532
SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER
All I need is you.

07:45.733 --> 07:47.534
So if you would just come back
by my side

07:47.635 --> 07:49.470
I know I'll get better.

07:49.570 --> 07:52.072
Love, I won't be gone.

07:52.172 --> 07:54.208
I won't be gone for long.

07:55.276 --> 07:56.610
Okay?

07:56.710 --> 07:57.978
SAVAGE'S DAUGHTER
I had a dream you and I,

07:58.078 --> 08:00.147
we're playing basketball

08:00.247 --> 08:03.350
on the basketball court
by our old house.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.420
You don't have to dream it
we can do it again.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.624
When I--
when I get this medicine,

08:10.724 --> 08:13.861
we're gonna be able to play it
all day,

08:13.961 --> 08:16.864
without ever having to stop.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.868
Time.

08:20.968 --> 08:22.803
Daddy, you're what I need.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.279
When you get inside,

08:33.314 --> 08:35.316
there's gonna be something
waiting for you from me

08:35.416 --> 08:36.350
in your cell.

08:37.551 --> 08:40.988
That will be the only way that
you can report directly to me

08:41.088 --> 08:42.523
from that shitshow.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.527
Other than that,
you're on your own.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.264
Watch yourself,

08:50.364 --> 08:52.533
so you can get back
to that little girl.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.986
Move!

09:50.190 --> 09:51.291
Move!

09:54.261 --> 09:56.029
Move!

09:58.399 --> 09:59.800
Get in here!

10:09.943 --> 10:11.979
Stop!

10:12.379 --> 10:15.482
My name is Lieutenant Killian,

10:16.016 --> 10:18.152
and I own you now!

10:19.153 --> 10:21.321
I will tell you when to bathe!

10:22.022 --> 10:25.092
I will tell you what to wear!

10:25.192 --> 10:29.329
I will tell you when to eat,
sleep, and shit!

10:30.063 --> 10:33.167
Now move!

10:34.535 --> 10:35.969
6-2-A.

10:37.538 --> 10:39.039
Get in here!

10:43.143 --> 10:44.311
He's gonna pat you down

10:44.411 --> 10:46.547
and you better not
motherfucking move, boy.

10:47.448 --> 10:49.316
Spread your legs.

10:55.924 --> 10:57.658
Chip him.

10:57.758 --> 11:00.060
I don't fuck with needles.

11:03.063 --> 11:05.165
Chip him now.

11:17.578 --> 11:19.914
Put his ass in Pod 7.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.444
Open doors to Pod 7.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.584
Get up, shitbags!

13:37.684 --> 13:39.386
Get on back!

13:44.993 --> 13:46.027
Hey asshole!

13:46.126 --> 13:48.195
I said get on back.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.367
Get your ass out here.

13:54.735 --> 13:55.803
Right now!

13:57.638 --> 13:59.807
Today sister,
get over there, boy.

13:59.907 --> 14:01.308
Move it!

14:14.721 --> 14:16.423
All accounted for!

14:16.523 --> 14:18.225
Chow time!

14:43.250 --> 14:45.285
Clumsy monkey!

14:46.353 --> 14:47.922
That's right,

14:48.022 --> 14:50.257
get on your knees
and bow down!

14:53.293 --> 14:54.728
Looks like

14:54.829 --> 14:56.763
I'm gonna have to teach you
some respect, little monkey boy.

15:03.203 --> 15:04.438
I'll see you soon, boy.

15:04.538 --> 15:06.573
I'll see you real soon.

16:14.508 --> 16:15.910
Yo yo.

16:17.277 --> 16:20.480
You're new here, right?

16:25.820 --> 16:29.289
Well, I hope you can fight,
motherfucker.

16:39.599 --> 16:41.501
How are you liking your stay
thus far?

16:43.670 --> 16:46.240
Yo, this motherfucker still
didn't realize where he is yet.

16:47.241 --> 16:48.876
Motherfucker.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.446
What's your story, black man?

16:54.381 --> 16:58.451
You an ally
or an enemy?

17:00.754 --> 17:02.089
I'm my own man.

17:03.825 --> 17:04.691
Yeah.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.561
Well, let me give you
some advice.

17:08.662 --> 17:12.465
Up in here,
you're gonna need allies.

17:13.633 --> 17:17.571
Now you could join my family,
my mafia.

17:18.873 --> 17:20.507
We protect our own.

17:24.278 --> 17:26.047
I fly solo.

17:35.256 --> 17:37.390
And you gonna die solo, too.

17:40.928 --> 17:42.063
Maybe he wanna die.

17:43.064 --> 17:44.631
Just give me the word.

17:53.274 --> 17:56.110
You will all be given
your work assignments.

17:57.377 --> 18:01.282
You will perform your
assignments twice a day

18:01.381 --> 18:04.151
unless only altered by
the Warden himself.

18:23.204 --> 18:24.604
Clean this.

18:26.107 --> 18:27.208
Clean this shit.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.259
Some of us don't like the way

18:45.458 --> 18:47.028
you've been running things
for the Warden.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.972
Bitch, this ain't no democracy.

19:06.047 --> 19:07.315
Hey!

19:39.880 --> 19:41.882
"Remember your promise to me.

19:42.682 --> 19:44.118
It is my hope.

19:45.319 --> 19:47.520
Your promise revives me.

19:49.457 --> 19:51.058
It comforts me.

19:54.829 --> 19:57.264
Protects me from
all of my troubles."

19:58.366 --> 19:59.967
Welcome to hell, boy.

20:17.184 --> 20:18.685
Are you the new boy?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.957
Told you I'd see you soon,
didn't I?

20:50.351 --> 20:51.718
Down or I'll open fire!

20:51.819 --> 20:55.489
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.224
Get these assholes
in the bean hole!

21:40.134 --> 21:41.235
I came here,

21:41.402 --> 21:45.772
because you went to sleep
without your superpowers.

21:53.013 --> 21:54.315
Ah.

22:03.124 --> 22:04.325
Man up.

22:06.427 --> 22:07.595
Man up.

22:28.349 --> 22:29.083
Take it, take it.

22:29.817 --> 22:30.484
Take that fucking.

22:32.052 --> 22:35.156
Now the next time you attack
another prisoner

22:35.256 --> 22:37.191
without my permission,

22:37.291 --> 22:41.162
I'm gonna turn up the settings,
understood?

22:41.262 --> 22:42.662
-Yes, sir.
-Alright.

22:42.762 --> 22:43.931
Now because you broke the rules,

22:44.031 --> 22:45.765
you're gonna have to pick
two of your own

22:45.866 --> 22:47.601
to fight against each other.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.436
Warden, come on,
please don't make me do--

22:49.537 --> 22:50.538
Okay, okay, okay.

22:50.638 --> 22:51.338
Okay!

22:51.438 --> 22:52.406
Understood.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.208
Alright,
get the fuck out of here.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.312
Oh, hold on.

23:00.581 --> 23:02.416
The final thing as discussed.

23:04.351 --> 23:05.186
I apologize for my--

23:05.286 --> 23:05.986
No, fuck that shit.

23:06.086 --> 23:07.121
In his eyes.

23:07.221 --> 23:09.223
Right in his fucking soul,
come on!

23:10.457 --> 23:13.693
I apologize for my actions.

23:20.700 --> 23:23.404
I would personally like to
apologize for his actions.

23:23.504 --> 23:26.307
Sometimes our fellow inmates,
they can get out of control.

23:27.374 --> 23:29.143
I am sorry.

23:29.243 --> 23:30.244
Terry Savage.

23:30.344 --> 23:32.179
Welcome, sir, have a seat.

23:32.279 --> 23:33.080
Have a seat right there.

23:33.280 --> 23:34.582
I got some stuff I wanna
tell you about.

23:34.682 --> 23:37.084
I'm excited, welcome.

23:43.123 --> 23:44.858
Oh yeah, that's the wife.

23:45.659 --> 23:47.361
Beauty queen right here.

23:47.461 --> 23:50.064
She can't cook for shit though,
I'll tell you that much.

23:50.164 --> 23:53.434
Yeah, with her,
we have to pray after we eat,

23:53.534 --> 23:55.002
so we don't shit ourselves.

23:56.270 --> 23:57.338
That was a joke, soldier.

23:57.438 --> 23:58.806
You can laugh at that.

24:02.676 --> 24:04.411
I'll tell you one thing.

24:05.946 --> 24:07.982
I will kill for my family.

24:08.916 --> 24:10.217
You got a family?

24:12.752 --> 24:15.456
Well, I've got a daughter.

24:15.556 --> 24:16.557
What's that?

24:16.657 --> 24:17.891
I can't hear you.

24:18.993 --> 24:20.227
I have a daughter.

24:20.327 --> 24:21.996
You have a daughter.

24:22.096 --> 24:23.530
Look at that, alright.

24:23.631 --> 24:25.432
Well,
then you got one goal here,

24:26.433 --> 24:27.968
one singular focus.

24:28.068 --> 24:31.171
To get back to her
as soon as you can.

24:34.608 --> 24:39.446
You see, this prison is owned
by a corporation, right.

24:39.546 --> 24:42.650
It's one in a long line of
privately-owned prisons,

24:42.750 --> 24:44.952
it's a chain, alright.

24:45.052 --> 24:47.187
Just like Burger King
or McDonald's

24:47.288 --> 24:50.190
and I guess I'm like this
branch's CEO.

24:50.291 --> 24:53.894
But I gotta be honest with you,
Terry, it's boring as shit.

24:53.994 --> 24:56.063
Looking in on the product.

24:56.163 --> 24:58.532
Right, we got some McNuggets,
what's in there.

24:58.632 --> 24:59.867
Got a McRib,

25:00.000 --> 25:02.503
You gotta Mcfucking
rehabilitation situation,

25:02.603 --> 25:04.071
I don't give a fuck.

25:04.938 --> 25:06.974
No excitement in it.

25:07.074 --> 25:08.342
So I gotta make it interesting.

25:10.311 --> 25:13.947
So what I've done is,
I've created The Dungeon.

25:15.883 --> 25:16.784
The Dungeon?

25:16.884 --> 25:18.118
Yeah, The Dungeon.

25:18.218 --> 25:20.421
And from what
I heard about you,

25:22.089 --> 25:23.023
you're pretty handy,

25:23.223 --> 25:24.024
you can handle yourself
in there,

25:24.124 --> 25:26.060
you'll have a good time.

25:26.160 --> 25:28.929
It's a way to kill time
and to earn rewards.

25:29.029 --> 25:30.964
What's in your wallet?

25:31.065 --> 25:32.099
That's another joke.

25:32.266 --> 25:33.967
It's alright,
you can laugh, soldier.

25:39.473 --> 25:42.142
Also, it's a good way for you
to get back to your daughter,

25:42.242 --> 25:43.310
faster.

25:44.378 --> 25:45.579
Alright?

25:45.679 --> 25:49.750
Now, what I need you to do is
meet your new roommate.

25:49.850 --> 25:51.085
He's gonna prep you,

25:51.185 --> 25:53.954
seeing that you two already
get along.

25:55.255 --> 25:57.558
I got a good feeling about you,
Terry.

25:58.792 --> 25:59.828
Alright.

25:59.927 --> 26:01.830
Get on out of here.

26:01.929 --> 26:03.731
Gina, give him his prize.

26:11.772 --> 26:13.040
Savage?

26:14.575 --> 26:17.111
The Sergeant Terry Savage?

26:19.613 --> 26:21.882
I served in the 77th Wolfpack.

26:22.783 --> 26:23.951
You and your squad

26:24.118 --> 26:25.252
saved my life
when my troops were outnumbered

26:25.352 --> 26:27.621
right outside Kabul
a few years ago.

26:28.956 --> 26:30.190
You're a legend.

26:39.666 --> 26:40.501
I was just doing my job only.

26:47.408 --> 26:50.677
I don't know how somebody like
you ends up in here.

26:51.846 --> 26:53.480
Don't expect no favors.

26:54.481 --> 26:56.083
I'm just doing my job.

26:56.984 --> 26:58.285
Now move.

26:59.686 --> 27:01.021
Yes, ma'am.

27:03.323 --> 27:04.925
Open 243.

27:07.561 --> 27:08.729
Go on.

27:19.773 --> 27:20.974
Welcome.

27:22.776 --> 27:24.645
Make yourself at home.

27:26.815 --> 27:28.817
Would you please um,
respect my house

27:28.917 --> 27:30.919
and take off your shoes.

27:31.018 --> 27:32.653
It's my house, no shoes.

27:34.521 --> 27:35.422
Okay.

27:37.991 --> 27:39.226
So,

27:41.930 --> 27:43.230
you play dominoes?

27:44.899 --> 27:46.066
No.

27:47.836 --> 27:49.036
Damn.

27:50.971 --> 27:52.973
Where'd you learn to fight?

27:54.909 --> 27:57.611
My father was a Grand Master
up in Okla.

27:57.711 --> 28:01.816
So I grew up in his dojo
where he taught me how to fight,

28:01.916 --> 28:04.518
physically and spiritually.

28:06.687 --> 28:09.122
You're gonna have to survive
The Dungeon.

28:10.591 --> 28:12.092
Whatever it takes.

28:13.427 --> 28:16.129
I just wanna get home
to my daughter.

28:16.230 --> 28:19.600
Well, you're inside
the system now, soldier.

28:19.700 --> 28:23.337
This place was designed to break

28:23.437 --> 28:25.472
black
and brown bodies like you

28:25.572 --> 28:27.774
and you fell right in.

28:27.876 --> 28:31.745
So if you have any hope of ever
seeing your little girl again,

28:31.846 --> 28:33.747
you gonna need to do two things.

28:34.748 --> 28:37.886
The first one is forget about
that outside world.

28:37.986 --> 28:39.219
Including, your little girl,

28:39.319 --> 28:41.923
'cause holding onto that
unreality

28:42.022 --> 28:44.424
will get you killed
in this reality.

28:44.525 --> 28:46.260
And secondly,

28:46.360 --> 28:48.795
you're gonna have to survive
The Dungeon.

28:50.030 --> 28:52.099
I can help you do that.

28:52.199 --> 28:55.702
Why should I trust you
or anybody else

28:55.803 --> 28:57.070
in this system?

28:58.438 --> 28:59.673
You can't.

29:03.277 --> 29:06.446
You mind if I use
your bathroom, OG?

29:06.547 --> 29:08.148
Call me "Bones".

29:08.248 --> 29:09.783
It's your bathroom now.

29:14.221 --> 29:15.756
Mind the curtain.

30:00.734 --> 30:02.235
Where're we going?

30:02.336 --> 30:03.871
Our new work assignment.

30:05.807 --> 30:07.374
Keep moving!

30:19.286 --> 30:20.754
Get to work.

30:27.361 --> 30:29.229
Now this area right here,

30:30.397 --> 30:33.400
this entire place used to be
used to break up circuit boards

30:33.500 --> 30:36.871
that the Warden would re-sell.

30:36.971 --> 30:39.339
Now we get to use it
to spar here.

30:39.439 --> 30:41.742
They got us locked up
like animals.

30:43.978 --> 30:45.612
Now we gotta fight
like 'em.

30:47.547 --> 30:49.182
See you're different from a lot
of the catch

30:49.282 --> 30:51.518
that run through this place.

30:51.618 --> 30:54.488
That's why when the Warden
asked why I helped you,

30:55.589 --> 30:57.391
I told him it's 'cause
you reminded me

30:57.491 --> 31:00.227
of a young man
I knew a long time ago.

31:02.329 --> 31:05.198
Now no matter what,
in order to survive this place,

31:05.298 --> 31:06.834
you're going have to fight.

31:07.935 --> 31:10.771
The Warden is gonna throw
your ass inside that Dungeon

31:10.872 --> 31:12.172
whether you like it or not

31:12.372 --> 31:16.710
and whether you live or die,
depends on what you know.

31:17.845 --> 31:19.513
Now let me help you.

31:22.749 --> 31:24.785
Do me the favor
and show me what you got.

31:44.604 --> 31:47.041
That's the Mexican Mob
over there,

31:47.141 --> 31:48.642
la familia.

31:49.676 --> 31:52.146
Then you've got the
Dragon Nation,

31:52.245 --> 31:53.848
ruthless.

31:53.948 --> 31:55.749
Nobody fucks with them.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.553
And you've met the
Aryan Brotherhood,

31:59.653 --> 32:01.521
aka The Klan,

32:01.621 --> 32:05.525
With your encounter with
Mongul, their uh, leader.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.761
Y'all gonna be good friends.

32:10.330 --> 32:12.399
Now you've met my man Freeway.

32:13.667 --> 32:16.369
He's crew is the Black Mafia.

32:16.470 --> 32:20.842
His style is a combination of
almost every style.

32:22.143 --> 32:26.680
But his nature is formless,
so he calls himself "Freeway".

32:28.216 --> 32:29.851
That's crazy,

32:29.951 --> 32:32.854
combine other styles.

32:34.287 --> 32:35.756
He's good at that.

32:38.092 --> 32:39.193
I taught him.

32:47.367 --> 32:48.970
That's enough, that's enough.

32:50.537 --> 32:51.906
Now I'm gonna share something
with you

32:52.006 --> 32:54.541
that I've rarely seen or said.

32:55.810 --> 32:57.912
You got all the heart
in the world,

32:59.147 --> 33:02.016
but if you're gonna survive
The Dungeon tomorrow night,

33:02.116 --> 33:02.917
you're gonna need some skill.

33:06.053 --> 33:07.654
What do you mean tomorrow?

33:07.754 --> 33:09.556
Every Friday,
is spent here in that Dungeon.

33:13.426 --> 33:15.562
Let me show you
what will help you.

33:16.898 --> 33:18.765
It starts with this.

33:24.972 --> 33:26.339
Surrender,

33:28.075 --> 33:29.543
surrender.

33:32.412 --> 33:34.548
Accept where you are.

33:36.383 --> 33:38.286
Accept this reality.

33:56.003 --> 33:57.704
Dungeon Time!

34:44.118 --> 34:45.719
Stop!

34:46.786 --> 34:48.089
Take them to The Dungeon.

34:48.189 --> 34:49.357
I gotta go meet the Warden.

34:49.456 --> 34:51.125
Yes, sir.

34:51.225 --> 34:53.327
I don't think your boy is
gonna make it, Bones.

34:55.296 --> 34:56.796
Hey let's go, come on.

35:11.379 --> 35:13.080
Good luck down there, Savage.

35:18.451 --> 35:20.687
Open 305.

35:29.562 --> 35:30.664
Right.

35:31.498 --> 35:32.266
Rene, hold my calls.

35:36.404 --> 35:37.905
Who wants it tonight?

35:39.572 --> 35:41.508
I'm getting hungry, and hungry,
and hungry.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.086
We're going to the--

35:52.253 --> 35:55.789
I can feel it, it's in the air,
as the bones crush.

36:07.301 --> 36:09.170
Welcome to The Dungeon.

36:52.079 --> 36:53.546
Welcome to The Dungeon!

36:53.646 --> 36:57.584
({inmates cheering]

36:57.684 --> 37:01.554
Here we are,
trapped in this hall together.

37:01.654 --> 37:02.622
But look,

37:02.789 --> 37:04.392
we get out of our cages
once a week

37:04.492 --> 37:05.759
for one reason only.

37:05.860 --> 37:08.229
And that is, The Dungeon!

37:11.899 --> 37:14.301
I need y'all to understand
that there is one rule

37:14.402 --> 37:15.936
and one rule only.

37:16.037 --> 37:17.505
Alright?

37:17.604 --> 37:19.507
And that's that there are
no motherfucking rules!

37:19.606 --> 37:21.042
Make some noise!

37:23.344 --> 37:26.013
Let's get it on!

37:28.349 --> 37:29.450
Let's go, gentlemen.

37:29.549 --> 37:30.583
Show me what you got.

38:25.638 --> 38:27.408
Fucking Warden!

38:27.508 --> 38:28.608
Well...

38:29.642 --> 38:33.214
you made your bed, son,
you made your bed.

38:33.314 --> 38:34.215
Alright.

38:34.315 --> 38:35.049
Who's up next?

38:35.149 --> 38:36.016
Let's go.

38:36.117 --> 38:37.818
Keep it moving.

38:37.918 --> 38:39.220
There's a momentum score,
people.

38:39.320 --> 38:41.489
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

38:41.589 --> 38:43.858
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

38:43.958 --> 38:46.460
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

38:46.560 --> 38:47.294
It's pointless.

39:03.344 --> 39:04.411
Where are you?

39:04.512 --> 39:05.678
Ah!

39:07.982 --> 39:10.317
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

39:10.417 --> 39:12.620
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!

39:12.719 --> 39:14.255
Freeway! Freeway!

39:18.058 --> 39:22.129
Freeway! Freeway! Freeway!
Freeway! Freeway!

39:23.130 --> 39:26.766
Now, up next we got some
fresh meat,

39:26.867 --> 39:28.936
by the name of Savage!

39:29.036 --> 39:31.639
Who was causing hell upstairs,
so we brought him downstairs

39:31.738 --> 39:32.473
for a little training.

39:36.410 --> 39:38.412
Let's see what you got, Savage.

39:38.512 --> 39:39.813
In the opposing corner,

39:39.914 --> 39:43.284
we have our local favorite
from the Mexican Mob,

39:43.384 --> 39:47.021
El Vampiro!!!

39:49.957 --> 39:51.758
He calls himself, "El Vampiro"

39:51.859 --> 39:55.029
because he sharpens his teeth
like a vampire.

39:55.129 --> 39:57.131
He ain't going for your face,
he's going for your legs.

39:57.231 --> 39:59.400
This whole thing is
to take you down.

39:59.500 --> 40:01.535
Watch yourself.

40:01.635 --> 40:03.237
Watch your hands of course.

40:07.541 --> 40:09.410
Wooh, wooh, wooh, yeah.

40:52.286 --> 40:53.654
Reach inside of him,

40:53.753 --> 40:56.156
pull his soul out,
if he have one.

40:57.324 --> 40:59.493
You trained about black eyes
and bloody noses.

40:59.593 --> 41:02.863
You gotta go out there
as life of fucking death.

41:02.963 --> 41:04.598
What's wrong?

41:04.698 --> 41:06.867
Don't let him take
the next round!

41:06.967 --> 41:08.335
Come on, get him, man!

41:08.435 --> 41:09.303
Come on now.

41:09.403 --> 41:10.904
Let's go, keep it moving.

41:30.891 --> 41:32.359
What the fuck was that?

41:33.827 --> 41:35.262
Okay.

41:35.362 --> 41:36.764
That's how you do it!

41:36.864 --> 41:37.998
Yeah! Yeah!

41:38.098 --> 41:39.233
That's what I'm talking about.

41:39.333 --> 41:40.200
Yeah!

41:49.276 --> 41:50.210
At least bring some water.

41:51.612 --> 41:52.713
Carry that man.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.214
We ain't-- we ain't got all day
for this.

41:54.315 --> 41:55.683
You alright?

42:18.672 --> 42:20.541
Freeway!

42:20.641 --> 42:21.875
Mmm.

42:23.711 --> 42:25.112
There's my quarterback.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.581
That's some great work
in The Dungeon, my man.

42:27.681 --> 42:28.716
What can I get for you?

42:28.817 --> 42:29.450
Steak dinner?

42:29.550 --> 42:30.884
A conjugal?

42:30.984 --> 42:33.020
Anything you want, you name it.

42:34.121 --> 42:35.622
How about you cut the bullshit?

42:36.890 --> 42:39.259
Tell me why Bones is helping
the new guy?

42:39.360 --> 42:39.927
Well, hold--

42:40.027 --> 42:41.261
Eh, slow down, son.

42:41.362 --> 42:42.196
What-- I--

42:42.363 --> 42:44.231
It sounds like
you're interrogating me.

42:44.331 --> 42:47.034
Well, I mean I'm the best
motherfucker you got.

42:47.134 --> 42:48.869
Don't I deserve to know?

42:52.239 --> 42:55.442
Bones claims that the new kid
reminds him of family

42:55.542 --> 42:56.510
or something.

42:56.677 --> 42:58.212
And he requested to have
his back.

42:58.312 --> 42:58.912
What-- wh--

42:59.012 --> 43:00.080
What's going on here?

43:00.180 --> 43:02.783
Are you intimidated,
by the new guy?

43:02.883 --> 43:04.017
What's happening?

43:04.118 --> 43:05.919
I ain't intimidated by nobody.

43:06.754 --> 43:07.654
Good.

43:08.555 --> 43:11.392
Then everything will
remain peaceful around here.

43:12.292 --> 43:13.260
Yeah.

43:13.360 --> 43:15.729
Things are peaceful,
because I'm the one.

43:15.830 --> 43:20.033
I'm the one enforcing your law
in and outside The Dungeon.

43:20.134 --> 43:21.435
And you're doing a lovely job.

43:21.535 --> 43:24.605
Have I not told you how much
I appreciate you?

43:24.705 --> 43:26.106
Good.

43:26.206 --> 43:27.040
Great,

43:27.174 --> 43:28.742
because I want what you
promised me.

43:28.843 --> 43:29.643
So when do I get out?

43:29.743 --> 43:30.778
Are we doing this again?

43:30.879 --> 43:31.745
Are we doing it?

43:31.912 --> 43:32.646
Look, let me get this straight.

43:32.746 --> 43:33.547
Hold on a second.

43:33.647 --> 43:34.915
I let you and your crew,

43:35.015 --> 43:37.584
your posse,
whatever you wanna call,

43:37.684 --> 43:38.786
treat this whole place like

43:38.986 --> 43:40.220
it's your own private little
street corner.

43:40.320 --> 43:41.789
That's what I'm doing for you.

43:41.890 --> 43:42.723
That's not enough?

43:42.824 --> 43:43.690
Yeah.

43:43.791 --> 43:45.827
Yeah, I got shit on lock.

43:45.926 --> 43:47.928
But if you can't keep your word,

43:48.028 --> 43:49.963
then maybe I can't guarantee
that all these prisoners

43:50.063 --> 43:51.365
are gonna keep
falling in line.

43:51.465 --> 43:52.466
Are you...

43:55.068 --> 43:56.370
It sounds like you're
threatening me?

43:57.337 --> 43:58.205
That--

43:59.039 --> 44:01.375
Have I created a monster?

44:01.475 --> 44:02.877
I want my freedom,

44:02.976 --> 44:05.145
that's what you fucking
promised me.

44:06.815 --> 44:09.016
I'mma working on it.

44:09.116 --> 44:11.618
I'm having conversations with
the Warden

44:11.718 --> 44:12.986
at the Aurora State Prison

44:13.086 --> 44:15.489
about getting you a re-match
with his Top Dog.

44:15.589 --> 44:19.259
You win that for me again,
you get your freedom.

44:19.359 --> 44:20.561
Stay sharp!

44:21.962 --> 44:23.363
I'm always sharp.

44:24.765 --> 44:26.266
I want my freedom.

44:27.401 --> 44:28.602
Alright.

44:35.576 --> 44:38.445
Yeah, well, I want Cindy
Crawford to rub my balls

44:38.545 --> 44:40.915
and make me a casserole.

44:41.014 --> 44:43.617
But I live in reality,
motherfucker!

45:01.502 --> 45:04.004
Savage, you have a visitor.

45:07.809 --> 45:10.444
Hi, Mr. Savage, it's a pleasure
to meet you in person.

45:10.544 --> 45:11.678
I'm Janette.

45:11.846 --> 45:14.014
I work for a pro-bono group,
National Veterans Affairs

45:14.114 --> 45:15.415
and I've been assigned
your case.

45:17.184 --> 45:19.921
You are
a highly-decorated soldier

45:20.822 --> 45:23.323
and I'm aware of your daughter's
medical condition.

45:24.725 --> 45:26.693
You're not a criminal.

45:26.793 --> 45:28.562
You were pushed into a corner.

45:30.297 --> 45:31.765
You can't help me.

45:33.667 --> 45:36.871
I graduated cum laude from
Howard University School of Law.

45:36.971 --> 45:39.273
I'm hihgly capable.

45:39.373 --> 45:41.742
I'm prepared
to fight for your freedom.

45:41.843 --> 45:42.476
Freedom?

45:42.576 --> 45:43.243
Yeah.

45:44.177 --> 45:47.347
There's been a lot of intel
coming out

45:47.447 --> 45:49.116
about too many
new private prisons

45:49.216 --> 45:51.785
and a lack of prisoners
to keep them filled.

45:51.886 --> 45:55.155
And some cities are so desperate
to keep these institutions open

45:55.255 --> 45:58.125
and the extra boost it gives
to the local job economy,

45:58.225 --> 46:00.494
they are creating a new system.

46:00.594 --> 46:04.765
One of supply and demand
of live human bodies.

46:05.599 --> 46:10.070
Mostly our people,
black and brown people.

46:12.606 --> 46:16.543
Mr. Savage,
I need you to stay strong, okay?

46:16.643 --> 46:18.712
We can fight this corrupt system
together.

46:18.813 --> 46:21.248
I just need you to trust me.

46:22.182 --> 46:23.617
I'm in here.

46:24.751 --> 46:27.922
They have physical custody
of my body.

46:28.022 --> 46:29.323
They own me.

46:30.424 --> 46:33.694
Therefore,
I must do what they say

46:34.661 --> 46:36.396
when they say.

46:39.132 --> 46:42.269
Listen, if you--
if you need anything,

46:43.403 --> 46:44.371
call me.

46:45.907 --> 46:47.842
I am goin'
to do everything I can

46:47.942 --> 46:49.476
to get you out of here.

46:52.947 --> 46:56.216
I-- I appreciate you, but um,

46:56.316 --> 46:58.619
I'm gonna have to handle this
on my own.

47:23.644 --> 47:24.812
Ignore him.

47:26.213 --> 47:27.547
You know I don't give a fuck

47:28.515 --> 47:30.717
about what he's showin' you.

47:30.818 --> 47:32.252
I hope you know that.

47:33.387 --> 47:35.522
You can't fuck with me.

47:35.622 --> 47:38.358
I ain't
like these other motherfuckers.

47:50.138 --> 47:52.406
You know, the truth is

47:52.506 --> 47:54.741
you and Freeway
are a whole lot alike.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.513
I ain't got shit
to do with that man.

47:59.613 --> 48:00.882
Oh yeah, you do.

48:02.116 --> 48:03.017
Think about it.

48:03.151 --> 48:05.619
Both of y'all are ex-military.

48:06.753 --> 48:09.924
He spent most of his life
fightin' in the streets, too.

48:11.625 --> 48:13.326
Truth is I tried to save him,

48:13.427 --> 48:15.796
but he refused
to let me help him.

48:15.897 --> 48:18.765
He was determined
to take the dark path.

48:20.868 --> 48:23.370
What makes you think
I ain't gonna go dark?

48:26.941 --> 48:29.143
You got your little girl.

48:29.242 --> 48:30.477
That gives you something
to live for,

48:30.577 --> 48:34.247
that's something
that Freeway never even had.

48:35.248 --> 48:38.685
So in that case,
you two are polar opposites.

48:38.785 --> 48:40.220
Yin and yang.

48:44.591 --> 48:46.793
Now this next fighter
that you're gonna face

48:46.894 --> 48:49.130
is named "Zee".

48:49.229 --> 48:51.598
He is the Dragon Nation's

48:52.799 --> 48:54.367
best fighter.

48:55.235 --> 48:57.471
If you have any chance
of beating him,

48:57.571 --> 49:00.041
you're going
to have to use your strength

49:00.141 --> 49:03.376
against his agility
and his speed.

49:04.277 --> 49:06.613
Brute force.

49:06.713 --> 49:10.084
Sometimes it's okay
to go gorilla, eh.

49:15.388 --> 49:16.590
Welcome to the dungeon!

49:20.594 --> 49:22.763
Now we're back
for another one now.

49:22.864 --> 49:24.531
In the right corner,
we've got the new

49:24.631 --> 49:29.070
came back for round 2 Savage!

49:32.140 --> 49:33.507
Right, that's right now.

49:33.607 --> 49:34.374
In the other corner...

49:36.010 --> 49:39.412
...from the Dragon Nation, Zee!

49:57.564 --> 49:58.465
All right, that's right!

49:58.598 --> 50:00.767
That's right, let's get it on!

50:12.046 --> 50:14.282
Let's go.

50:36.369 --> 50:37.972
What'd you do,
grow a conscience?

50:39.040 --> 50:40.975
Come on.

50:41.075 --> 50:42.375
The shit is over.

50:42.475 --> 50:44.245
He was gonna kill you.

50:44.344 --> 50:45.313
What you got wrong?

50:55.722 --> 50:57.959
Boo!

51:11.504 --> 51:13.007
Hey, wait a minute,
where you goin'?

51:14.008 --> 51:15.243
Where's he goin'?

51:15.343 --> 51:16.576
You're gonna leave us?

51:17.311 --> 51:18.145
All right, who's up next?

51:23.317 --> 51:24.751
Hopefully,
they will close the show.

51:24.852 --> 51:26.921
Let's go!

51:33.693 --> 51:37.697
You know, one of the good things
about being an OG in this place

51:37.797 --> 51:39.934
is you know
where to get what you need.

51:40.034 --> 51:41.302
Yeah.

51:41.401 --> 51:43.104
I got nothin' to celebrate.

51:44.138 --> 51:45.373
This ain't no celebration, man.

51:45.472 --> 51:49.110
We-- it's a reward
for still bein' alive.

51:50.011 --> 51:52.914
Come on, man, don't--
don't insult me.

51:53.014 --> 51:57.450
Huh, these days I drink
just about anything, man.

52:02.356 --> 52:04.524
Why are you on the inside?

52:07.028 --> 52:07.962
Murder.

52:11.299 --> 52:12.766
Murder?

52:12.867 --> 52:14.201
Yeah, murder.

52:16.170 --> 52:17.737
See you ain't the

52:18.638 --> 52:21.441
only holder
of a patent on stupidity.

52:22.276 --> 52:24.477
I was young like you once, too.

52:25.545 --> 52:26.746
Anyway, um...

52:28.548 --> 52:33.054
This psycho rapist put his hands
on my little sister.

52:34.155 --> 52:37.191
I mean she was 21,
but she's still my baby sister.

52:38.725 --> 52:40.895
So I went out for revenge,
and I found him,

52:40.995 --> 52:44.332
and uh, beat that predator
to death

52:44.432 --> 52:46.000
with my bare hands.

52:47.801 --> 52:52.239
What started out for revenge,
the karma of the universe, man,

52:52.340 --> 52:55.775
I ended up having to pay
with my soul.

52:56.877 --> 52:58.778
Don't let that happen to you.

53:04.517 --> 53:06.988
You know, sometimes I wonder...

53:08.889 --> 53:11.192
...if I still have a soul.

53:14.061 --> 53:15.162
You do.

53:17.031 --> 53:18.299
I can see it.

53:28.508 --> 53:30.543
Hey, you want some chips?

53:43.424 --> 53:45.026
What's goin' on?

53:47.261 --> 53:49.096
You're a threat now.

54:34.574 --> 54:36.609
Fuck.

54:58.432 --> 55:00.367
Freeze or I'll drop you both!

55:02.136 --> 55:04.271
No!

55:09.243 --> 55:11.011
Shit, oh shit.

55:11.112 --> 55:11.946
Fuck.

55:15.349 --> 55:16.283
Hold on.

55:16.383 --> 55:18.119
Hold on, no, wait.

55:19.487 --> 55:20.955
I was just doing my job.

55:21.055 --> 55:22.655
Oh. Oh my God.

55:23.457 --> 55:24.158
Now we're even.

55:24.258 --> 55:25.392
Please.

55:25.493 --> 55:27.660
Help!

55:34.235 --> 55:35.369
Come in.

55:39.140 --> 55:41.809
Hey, thank you.

55:44.912 --> 55:47.481
Because of your quick thinkin'
that guard's gonna live

55:47.581 --> 55:49.782
and you saved my ass

55:49.884 --> 55:52.386
from a lot of
unwanted attention.

55:53.420 --> 55:56.957
That female guard,
she risked it all for me.

55:57.057 --> 55:58.159
She did.

55:59.059 --> 56:01.128
I feel your pain, believe me,
I do.

56:01.228 --> 56:03.330
It's one thing if a prisoner
dies on the inside,

56:03.430 --> 56:04.398
but a guard?

56:05.533 --> 56:09.203
Man, that shows my-- my weakness
to control this institution.

56:09.769 --> 56:11.472
So thank you.

56:11.572 --> 56:15.409
And by the way, I might
have a little talk with Freeway.

56:16.310 --> 56:17.311
For what?

56:18.379 --> 56:19.213
Fuck him.

56:20.080 --> 56:22.216
I'm ready to take his ass out.

56:22.316 --> 56:23.384
Set up the fight.

56:23.517 --> 56:26.153
No, you haven't made your way
to that fight yet.

56:26.987 --> 56:28.255
Sorry, I can't make that happen.

56:28.355 --> 56:29.223
Why not?

56:31.058 --> 56:33.527
You control all the shit
inside these walls, right?

56:33.627 --> 56:34.828
That I do.

56:35.596 --> 56:36.564
I control it all.

56:36.664 --> 56:38.032
Don't get it twisted.

56:39.166 --> 56:43.170
But uh, is that a fight
you're ready for?

56:52.246 --> 56:53.180
Set it up.

56:55.950 --> 56:59.853
Guard, back to my cell.

57:01.322 --> 57:02.556
All right.

57:02.656 --> 57:03.723
All right.

57:23.210 --> 57:25.246
Yeah, you know, you fucked up,
right?

57:26.247 --> 57:27.548
We thought we'd take him out
for you, man?

57:27.648 --> 57:28.415
Yeah, well, you thought wrong.

57:29.516 --> 57:31.885
I never gave that fuckin' order!

57:33.320 --> 57:34.855
Dumbass motherfucker.

57:38.826 --> 57:40.861
Warden wants to see you
in the dungeon.

57:41.794 --> 57:42.896
All of you.

57:57.111 --> 57:59.980
Y'all wanna know
why this is my favorite room?

58:00.080 --> 58:01.781
It's 'cause I can
turn off these cameras

58:01.882 --> 58:03.284
whenever I want.

58:04.385 --> 58:05.319
Yeah.

58:05.419 --> 58:06.754
Come on in the ring, boys,

58:06.854 --> 58:08.788
I wanna talk about
some business!

58:11.859 --> 58:12.893
Oh, that's funny, I--
I could have sworn

58:12.993 --> 58:14.128
I was in charge.

58:14.228 --> 58:16.130
See the ring, go there!

58:29.043 --> 58:30.811
You still can't follow rule.

58:31.812 --> 58:32.513
Okay.

58:40.988 --> 58:44.191
You broke
my motherfuckin' rules!

58:46.327 --> 58:47.561
Kill him!

58:49.930 --> 58:52.900
What the f-- what the fuck, man?

59:03.077 --> 59:05.913
I'm the head motherfucker
in charge.

59:08.449 --> 59:12.119
I never gave that order.

59:12.219 --> 59:13.787
I get it.

59:13.887 --> 59:15.322
Fuck, I get it!

59:16.423 --> 59:18.659
I fucked up.

59:18.759 --> 59:20.994
I'm glad
we're on the same page now.

59:21.095 --> 59:22.730
Now you're gonna do
whatever I want.

59:22.831 --> 59:23.731
What do you want from me?

59:23.832 --> 59:26.200
I want you to fight Savage.

59:26.300 --> 59:29.503
No, he hasn't earned that spot.

59:29.603 --> 59:31.638
Why are you so fuckin' stupid?

59:33.107 --> 59:35.609
You wanna spend the rest
of your life in prison?

59:35.709 --> 59:38.112
You afraid of him? What is it?

59:41.782 --> 59:43.250
Okay.

59:45.820 --> 59:47.688
I'll fight.

59:47.788 --> 59:49.723
I'm glad we're on the same page.

59:49.824 --> 59:51.158
I'm glad you're excited.

59:51.258 --> 59:52.426
I am.

59:54.395 --> 59:58.232
Would be great to see
the two of you battle it out.

59:58.332 --> 1:00:01.235
I'm glad we had this little
attitude adjustment.

1:00:05.939 --> 1:00:08.308
Back to your cage, top dog.

1:00:09.410 --> 1:00:10.511
Move!

1:00:23.424 --> 1:00:25.292
What are you
specifically hitting?

1:00:26.059 --> 1:00:26.861
A person.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.162
A person.

1:00:28.262 --> 1:00:30.531
Well, hit what he's
goin' to hit you with.

1:00:32.366 --> 1:00:33.534
Hit his hands.

1:00:35.035 --> 1:00:38.005
Let his hands come at you,
and anticipate it,

1:00:38.105 --> 1:00:39.606
and stop it.

1:00:59.126 --> 1:01:01.128
I heard you wanna see me
in the dungeon.

1:01:02.663 --> 1:01:04.465
I don't fuck with bullies.

1:01:07.434 --> 1:01:09.336
How about we give 'em
what they want.

1:01:29.523 --> 1:01:30.591
Peach punch.

1:01:33.427 --> 1:01:34.595
With purpose.

1:01:36.697 --> 1:01:38.031
Pull it back.

1:01:38.131 --> 1:01:40.133
Hands to the head, bro.

1:02:21.775 --> 1:02:24.044
I want you to remember
why you agreed to do this

1:02:24.144 --> 1:02:26.113
in the first place.

1:02:26.213 --> 1:02:27.815
To save your daughter, man.

1:02:30.919 --> 1:02:32.386
Get to your girl.

1:03:08.022 --> 1:03:10.825
All authorized personnel
to the dungeon.

1:03:13.027 --> 1:03:15.529
Wooh, shit! You ready?

1:03:15.629 --> 1:03:17.331
God damn!

1:03:17.431 --> 1:03:18.799
Let's see if we're gonna
crown ourselves a new king!

1:03:20.969 --> 1:03:23.071
My kingdom for a crown.

1:03:23.170 --> 1:03:26.808
See who's ready
to change their lives.

1:03:26.908 --> 1:03:28.542
Come on now.

1:03:31.045 --> 1:03:33.014
Man, can you feel it?

1:03:33.113 --> 1:03:34.781
Yes, sir.

1:03:34.882 --> 1:03:36.316
Man, I love you.

1:03:50.364 --> 1:03:51.966
Take it away, warden!

1:03:52.066 --> 1:03:53.901
Fight!

1:03:54.035 --> 1:03:57.471
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:03:57.571 --> 1:03:59.539
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:04:03.945 --> 1:04:05.913
Tonight, gentlemen,

1:04:06.014 --> 1:04:08.482
I got something truly special
for you.

1:04:09.549 --> 1:04:12.686
Two gladiators, two warriors.

1:04:13.687 --> 1:04:17.257
One will come out a champion
and the other...

1:04:17.357 --> 1:04:19.894
Well, there may be
a lot of slow singin'

1:04:19.994 --> 1:04:21.495
and flower bringin'

1:04:21.595 --> 1:04:23.931
when that motherfuckin' bell
starts ringin'.

1:04:24.032 --> 1:04:25.499
You know what I'm sayin'?

1:04:26.500 --> 1:04:28.836
Let's give it up for Savage!

1:04:42.315 --> 1:04:44.852
And over here,
we got our top dog.

1:04:45.786 --> 1:04:47.554
Give it up for Freeway!

1:05:06.273 --> 1:05:07.274
Let's get it on!

1:05:07.374 --> 1:05:07.975
Yeah!

1:06:30.124 --> 1:06:32.626
Savage! Stop!

1:06:32.726 --> 1:06:33.393
What?

1:06:35.529 --> 1:06:37.330
That's enough. Come on!

1:06:37.430 --> 1:06:40.268
Wooh, Savage is the man now,
baby!

1:06:40.367 --> 1:06:43.237
Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:06:43.336 --> 1:06:47.440
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage!

1:06:50.945 --> 1:06:52.379
Yeah!

1:06:52.479 --> 1:06:53.780
That's the spirit. Come on!

1:06:56.683 --> 1:07:00.654
Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage,
Savage, Savage, Savage, Savage!

1:07:14.668 --> 1:07:15.335
Wooh!

1:08:12.059 --> 1:08:13.526
Well, if you don't mind...

1:08:27.241 --> 1:08:28.943
Apparently, you are the man.

1:08:47.295 --> 1:08:49.230
I could get used to this.

1:08:49.330 --> 1:08:51.665
But the part you left out is

1:08:52.900 --> 1:08:55.602
havin' to keep eyes
on the back of my head.

1:08:55.702 --> 1:08:57.138
Ain't no growin' when you don't.

1:08:57.238 --> 1:08:58.940
The warden wants to see you.

1:09:03.010 --> 1:09:05.846
When you're done eating,
of course.

1:09:13.520 --> 1:09:15.522
That's too much power
for one convict.

1:09:19.060 --> 1:09:20.527
There he is.

1:09:21.628 --> 1:09:24.165
How does it feel
to be The Man now?

1:09:24.265 --> 1:09:26.300
Huh? Have a seat.

1:09:26.400 --> 1:09:28.235
Go on, have a seat!

1:09:28.336 --> 1:09:30.338
You deserve it. You kiddin' me?

1:09:30.438 --> 1:09:31.939
The way you just
beat down Freeway,

1:09:32.039 --> 1:09:36.010
I could have sold that
for 69.99 on pay-per-view.

1:09:38.245 --> 1:09:40.982
You and me we could do
a lot of business together.

1:09:41.082 --> 1:09:42.316
Come on.

1:09:42.416 --> 1:09:44.251
You know what?

1:09:44.352 --> 1:09:48.222
Let's go for a walk. Come on.

1:09:48.322 --> 1:09:49.622
Take a little victory lap,
champ.

1:09:51.325 --> 1:09:53.060
Let's go, champ.

1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:54.895
I wanna show you somethin'.

1:09:54.996 --> 1:09:55.830
Come on.

1:10:01.701 --> 1:10:03.536
Look at this. See that?

1:10:04.305 --> 1:10:05.806
All eyes are on you, Tupac.

1:10:05.906 --> 1:10:07.375
Come on now.

1:10:07.475 --> 1:10:08.909
You got everyone's attention now

1:10:09.010 --> 1:10:11.278
and you got my attention
as well.

1:10:11.379 --> 1:10:13.247
You're the people's champ.

1:10:13.347 --> 1:10:14.115
Can you feel it?

1:10:14.215 --> 1:10:15.116
You feel that power?

1:10:16.250 --> 1:10:18.685
So you think about that
what you wanna do with that.

1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:21.521
I got a proposition for you.

1:10:23.324 --> 1:10:24.258
You see what I see?

1:10:24.358 --> 1:10:25.860
Yeah, a lot of bad decisions.

1:10:25.960 --> 1:10:27.694
Yeah, I see what you see.

1:10:28.628 --> 1:10:31.232
These are fathers, big brothers.

1:10:32.665 --> 1:10:36.904
Leaders, kings, patriarchs,
alphas.

1:10:38.072 --> 1:10:40.307
They come in here
with a problem,

1:10:40.408 --> 1:10:42.843
they leave with a problem.

1:10:42.943 --> 1:10:44.879
There's no rehabilitation, sir.

1:10:44.979 --> 1:10:47.647
All right, well, listen,
let me tell you something.

1:10:48.816 --> 1:10:51.118
I'm a problem solver, okay?

1:10:51.218 --> 1:10:52.353
Walk with me.

1:10:52.520 --> 1:10:54.288
I wanna show you
how to solve your problems.

1:10:54.388 --> 1:10:55.990
I can't fix everyone's problem.

1:10:56.090 --> 1:10:57.425
Come on, let's walk.

1:10:57.525 --> 1:10:58.092
All right, listen--

1:10:58.192 --> 1:10:59.193
Got you.

1:10:59.293 --> 1:11:00.194
Come on.

1:11:00.327 --> 1:11:02.430
Come on, champ, listen to me.

1:11:02.530 --> 1:11:04.597
You could run this place.

1:11:04.697 --> 1:11:07.667
With me havin' your back,
come on now,

1:11:07.767 --> 1:11:09.769
nothing could take you down.

1:11:09.870 --> 1:11:10.838
Nothing.

1:11:12.572 --> 1:11:13.908
You wanna run this place?

1:11:19.480 --> 1:11:20.848
I don't want it.

1:11:21.882 --> 1:11:23.918
Well, before you turn me down,

1:11:24.819 --> 1:11:26.520
why don't you see
what you're missin'?

1:11:26.619 --> 1:11:27.822
Come on now.

1:11:28.588 --> 1:11:29.390
You can't even
make a decision yet.

1:11:29.490 --> 1:11:30.690
Come on!

1:11:38.199 --> 1:11:40.000
It's all right, fellas,
keep workin'.

1:11:40.101 --> 1:11:41.435
Keep working.

1:11:41.535 --> 1:11:42.303
Play through.

1:11:42.403 --> 1:11:43.971
Good job, everybody.

1:11:45.172 --> 1:11:46.474
Good to see you.

1:11:46.574 --> 1:11:48.843
Right here, you look at that,

1:11:48.943 --> 1:11:52.379
some of the best chronic
in the city, right there.

1:11:52.480 --> 1:11:54.714
We get that
to local dispensaries

1:11:54.815 --> 1:11:56.350
and we get it at a discount.

1:11:56.450 --> 1:11:57.952
That's legal.

1:11:58.052 --> 1:12:00.620
Sticky icky icky,
you know what that is.

1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:02.256
And right over here...

1:12:03.991 --> 1:12:06.827
...you know, that's the uh,
pure Bolivian marching powder.

1:12:06.927 --> 1:12:09.930
A little pick-me-up, you know,
when you go to Cancun.

1:12:10.030 --> 1:12:11.132
Okay.

1:12:11.265 --> 1:12:13.234
You got your pharmaceuticals
in case you, you know,

1:12:13.334 --> 1:12:15.668
you need to do your homework,
you need to focus up.

1:12:15.768 --> 1:12:17.371
And over right there...

1:12:17.471 --> 1:12:18.771
There.

1:12:20.574 --> 1:12:23.978
That's the US currency, man,
that's the fruit of your labors.

1:12:24.078 --> 1:12:26.013
That's gonna go right
in our pockets.

1:12:27.481 --> 1:12:29.216
This is uh...

1:12:30.683 --> 1:12:32.719
...this is modern-day slavery.

1:12:33.686 --> 1:12:35.456
I would--
I wouldn't call it "slavery".

1:12:35.556 --> 1:12:36.524
Come on now.

1:12:36.689 --> 1:12:37.925
I-- I would call it um,
you know,

1:12:38.025 --> 1:12:39.927
let's called is "free labor".

1:12:40.895 --> 1:12:42.695
It's the American way.

1:12:45.499 --> 1:12:46.766
Think about it.

1:12:47.568 --> 1:12:48.735
All right.

1:12:50.337 --> 1:12:52.306
Come on, come on.

1:13:00.680 --> 1:13:01.916
Why are you showin' me all this?

1:13:02.016 --> 1:13:05.252
Because I want you
to be the first top dog

1:13:05.352 --> 1:13:09.356
to enjoy all the full perks
of your labor.

1:13:09.456 --> 1:13:10.391
All right?

1:13:10.491 --> 1:13:11.859
Why not?

1:13:15.496 --> 1:13:16.230
You know why.

1:13:16.330 --> 1:13:17.898
Think about it.

1:13:24.737 --> 1:13:25.606
You good?

1:13:25.705 --> 1:13:26.473
Yeah.

1:13:26.574 --> 1:13:27.441
You good?

1:13:27.541 --> 1:13:28.775
I'm gonna think about it.

1:13:28.976 --> 1:13:30.743
- Yeah, there you go.
- Just think about it.

1:13:32.880 --> 1:13:34.747
Ruminate on it.

1:13:34.848 --> 1:13:35.748
Good job, fellas.

1:13:35.849 --> 1:13:36.716
Keep-- keep playin' through.

1:13:36.817 --> 1:13:38.219
Good work, everybody.

1:13:39.286 --> 1:13:40.821
Come on in.

1:13:40.921 --> 1:13:42.423
I want you to take a look
at something.

1:13:42.523 --> 1:13:43.824
Come on, over here.

1:13:43.924 --> 1:13:45.192
Can you-- excuse me.

1:13:45.292 --> 1:13:47.194
Can you show this to him,
please?

1:13:47.294 --> 1:13:49.430
I want you to take a look
at this right here.

1:13:49.530 --> 1:13:51.165
Take a good look, okay?

1:13:51.265 --> 1:13:52.799
You wanted justice--

1:13:52.900 --> 1:13:55.402
All right, for the guard
that saved your life.

1:13:55.502 --> 1:13:57.371
This is justice right here.

1:13:57.471 --> 1:13:59.840
Take a look. Okay?

1:14:02.443 --> 1:14:05.212
I want you to know
that I am here for you.

1:14:05.312 --> 1:14:07.014
There's nothin'
I won't do for you.

1:14:07.114 --> 1:14:09.950
I wanna show you that I am loyal

1:14:10.050 --> 1:14:12.186
to those people
that are loyal to me.

1:14:13.120 --> 1:14:14.221
Sir.

1:14:17.992 --> 1:14:20.127
Nobody goes this far.

1:14:22.296 --> 1:14:23.397
Understand?

1:14:24.632 --> 1:14:26.533
Well.

1:14:26.634 --> 1:14:27.635
I just want my daughter.

1:14:27.835 --> 1:14:28.869
Okay,
we're gonna get your daughter.

1:14:28.969 --> 1:14:29.870
Yeah?

1:14:30.004 --> 1:14:32.172
Yeah. I'm-- I'm here for you.

1:14:36.477 --> 1:14:38.245
- I am loyal.
- Yeah.

1:14:38.345 --> 1:14:39.480
This is loyalty.

1:14:39.580 --> 1:14:40.514
Mmhmm.

1:14:41.849 --> 1:14:43.350
Cover that up.

1:14:58.866 --> 1:15:00.167
Come on in.

1:15:03.971 --> 1:15:06.073
I'll-- I'll wait back here.

1:15:07.541 --> 1:15:08.976
I'm done with this.

1:15:09.777 --> 1:15:10.978
You're done...

1:15:14.148 --> 1:15:16.183
...when we say you're done.

1:15:18.485 --> 1:15:19.586
Have a seat.

1:15:21.488 --> 1:15:23.757
Fuck is goin' on?

1:15:23.857 --> 1:15:25.159
Yeah, that's right.

1:15:26.627 --> 1:15:28.062
What the fuck?

1:15:28.228 --> 1:15:31.498
Sorry, it uh, took me a minute
to respond to your last text,

1:15:31.598 --> 1:15:34.702
but I-- I figured it'd be better
if we all got together

1:15:34.802 --> 1:15:36.337
and spoke in person.

1:15:36.503 --> 1:15:39.740
Now I thought you said he'd be
willing to go all the way.

1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:41.642
Oh, he will be.

1:15:41.742 --> 1:15:43.277
This was uh--

1:15:44.411 --> 1:15:46.180
it's all a game, hmm?

1:15:46.280 --> 1:15:47.348
You see,

1:15:47.448 --> 1:15:50.951
my good friend,
the commissioner and myself--

1:15:51.051 --> 1:15:52.453
Oh yeah, we're good friend.

1:15:53.454 --> 1:15:55.789
We're gonna split
this whole thing 50-50,

1:15:55.889 --> 1:15:56.990
all right?

1:15:57.157 --> 1:15:58.625
And I wanted to cut you in
on the profit,

1:15:58.726 --> 1:16:01.195
but you didn't want
any part of it.

1:16:01.295 --> 1:16:03.697
Really too bad,
because it's quite profitable.

1:16:03.797 --> 1:16:05.399
Yeah.

1:16:05.566 --> 1:16:07.101
Especially, when you add
the gambling ring that we run

1:16:07.201 --> 1:16:11.705
and seven other private prisons
in nearby counties,

1:16:11.806 --> 1:16:14.575
pitting top dogs
against our top dog.

1:16:14.675 --> 1:16:17.211
And you're our top dog now.

1:16:17.311 --> 1:16:19.146
You work for us.

1:16:19.246 --> 1:16:23.384
Hell, you exceeded expectations.

1:16:23.484 --> 1:16:24.585
I even won the wager.

1:16:24.685 --> 1:16:26.053
Oh, come on, really?
I thought you forgot about that.

1:16:26.153 --> 1:16:27.588
-Come on, give it up.
-Uh, dammit.

1:16:27.688 --> 1:16:28.789
Give it up.

1:16:28.889 --> 1:16:30.491
Rub it in, huh, Harvey?

1:16:32.559 --> 1:16:33.660
There we go.

1:16:34.863 --> 1:16:38.499
Okay. I'm done-- done with this.

1:16:40.134 --> 1:16:42.169
Now I knew he'd go soft on us.

1:16:42.269 --> 1:16:43.203
Uh-huh?

1:16:43.337 --> 1:16:45.372
That's why I got a plan B
for your ass.

1:16:45.472 --> 1:16:46.573
Well, how about that?

1:16:46.673 --> 1:16:48.242
Bring him in here.

1:16:52.312 --> 1:16:53.514
No!

1:16:54.648 --> 1:16:56.116
Bones.

1:16:58.385 --> 1:16:59.286
Damn, that's gotta--

1:16:59.386 --> 1:17:00.587
Okay!

1:17:00.687 --> 1:17:01.989
Okay!

1:17:02.089 --> 1:17:04.458
Okay, I'll fight.

1:17:04.558 --> 1:17:05.827
Okay?

1:17:05.926 --> 1:17:08.328
Get 'em out of here,
both of 'em.

1:17:08.429 --> 1:17:09.563
Stand up, soldier.

1:17:10.531 --> 1:17:11.866
Stand up.

1:17:11.965 --> 1:17:13.434
Finally.

1:17:13.534 --> 1:17:14.368
Move.

1:17:14.535 --> 1:17:15.702
Told you he was the man.

1:17:15.803 --> 1:17:17.404
God, I hope so.

1:17:17.504 --> 1:17:20.073
I'll call the warden
at the Aurora State Prison,

1:17:20.842 --> 1:17:23.744
get his top dog for a rematch.

1:17:23.845 --> 1:17:25.946
Good. Good.

1:17:26.046 --> 1:17:27.748
Now I gotta get out of here.

1:17:27.849 --> 1:17:29.283
All right.

1:17:29.383 --> 1:17:32.252
I can't be seen hangin' around
with an evil man like you.

1:17:33.153 --> 1:17:34.621
Give me a break.

1:17:35.824 --> 1:17:37.090
Got an image.

1:17:37.291 --> 1:17:39.793
Yeah, I could take lessons from
you, you little freak.

1:17:39.894 --> 1:17:41.795
You're the goddamn devil.

1:17:52.005 --> 1:17:53.207
Fuck.

1:17:56.243 --> 1:17:57.411
Well, that electricity, man,

1:17:57.511 --> 1:18:00.581
that's a mood modifier
for your ass.

1:18:01.682 --> 1:18:03.450
You can't argue with it.

1:18:07.654 --> 1:18:11.058
Look, man, now you know
they ain't gonna let you go.

1:18:11.960 --> 1:18:13.627
You know that, right?

1:18:13.727 --> 1:18:14.695
I know.

1:18:16.029 --> 1:18:18.165
So what in the hell
you gonna do, man?

1:18:28.008 --> 1:18:30.744
It's time to burn
this motherfucker down.

1:19:27.267 --> 1:19:28.702
Thank you for
letting me do this.

1:20:12.646 --> 1:20:14.247
We're all in.

1:20:28.395 --> 1:20:29.563
I'm surprised you called me.

1:20:29.663 --> 1:20:31.231
You have something
I can use to help you?

1:20:37.105 --> 1:20:38.639
That's all you need.

1:20:40.908 --> 1:20:41.708
What is this?

1:20:45.412 --> 1:20:46.914
You should leave now.

1:20:48.016 --> 1:20:48.682
What?

1:20:48.782 --> 1:20:50.852
Leave now.

1:20:54.088 --> 1:20:56.223
Leave now!

1:20:56.323 --> 1:20:59.359
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!
- Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:20:59.459 --> 1:21:01.129
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

1:21:07.300 --> 1:21:09.037
Nothing like a good rematch.

1:21:09.137 --> 1:21:10.504
I got the whole damn ring.

1:21:11.271 --> 1:21:13.306
Useless cake.

1:21:40.001 --> 1:21:43.403
I can't tell you how much
I have waited to do this.

1:21:45.106 --> 1:21:46.440
Who is this?

1:21:47.207 --> 1:21:49.043
This is my top dog, man.

1:21:49.143 --> 1:21:50.277
No, no, no.

1:21:50.477 --> 1:21:52.546
W-- what about the rematch
that we agreed on?

1:21:53.081 --> 1:21:53.881
This is--

1:21:54.015 --> 1:21:55.049
What--

1:21:55.282 --> 1:21:56.650
The fighter from last time,
where is he?

1:21:56.750 --> 1:22:00.754
Uh, well, Chaka here
transferred in three nights ago

1:22:00.855 --> 1:22:04.491
and he killed my last top dog
two nights ago.

1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:06.861
What the fuck, man?

1:22:06.994 --> 1:22:07.794
Come on-- come-- now come on.

1:22:07.895 --> 1:22:08.996
What the fuck what?

1:22:09.197 --> 1:22:11.431
What in the name of Wakanda
is this shit?

1:22:11.531 --> 1:22:13.233
This is a different weight class
right here.

1:22:13.333 --> 1:22:15.002
He's not right for me, okay?

1:22:15.103 --> 1:22:18.206
This is my fighter, my top dog.

1:22:18.305 --> 1:22:19.807
Take it or leave it.

1:22:19.907 --> 1:22:25.146
Or forfeit, and I'll gladly take
my $100,000,

1:22:25.245 --> 1:22:27.882
and we'll go back to our prison.

1:22:29.683 --> 1:22:31.251
You're an evil bastard,
all right?

1:22:31.351 --> 1:22:34.454
Uh, evil just runs here.

1:22:36.057 --> 1:22:37.892
I don't have a choice, do I?

1:22:38.792 --> 1:22:40.761
All right, bring book,
let's do it.

1:22:40.862 --> 1:22:42.696
Come on. Fuck you.

1:23:01.481 --> 1:23:03.851
Welcome back
to the dungeon, family!

1:23:07.721 --> 1:23:09.556
Now, now, now, I know you know

1:23:09.656 --> 1:23:11.458
that tonight
is a very special night.

1:23:11.558 --> 1:23:14.061
We are here
for the finale fight.

1:23:14.162 --> 1:23:17.965
We have our hometown brother
Savage!

1:23:18.065 --> 1:23:22.036
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:23:22.136 --> 1:23:25.572
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:28.441
All right, all right, all right,
all right!

1:23:28.542 --> 1:23:32.079
Now on the opposin' corner,
this poser here,

1:23:32.180 --> 1:23:33.580
coming from
the Aurora Penitentiary

1:23:33.680 --> 1:23:36.984
when they got some sweet,
silk sheets night,

1:23:37.084 --> 1:23:39.187
his name is Chaka!

1:23:39.287 --> 1:23:43.191
- Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!
- Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

1:23:43.291 --> 1:23:46.928
Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo! Boo!

1:23:53.366 --> 1:23:56.803
Hey, good luck
to your fighter today.

1:23:56.904 --> 1:23:59.406
Fuck you, Super Mario.

1:24:00.640 --> 1:24:03.476
Get goin', let's fight!

1:24:05.246 --> 1:24:08.049
- Yeah! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:24:08.149 --> 1:24:09.984
There are no rules!

1:24:10.184 --> 1:24:13.821
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:24:38.813 --> 1:24:41.249
Ha-ha! Come on.

1:24:47.654 --> 1:24:48.890
Looks like
you don't even have a chance!

1:24:54.694 --> 1:24:55.997
Come on. Come up with something.

1:24:56.097 --> 1:24:58.065
Come on, baby, let's go.

1:24:58.165 --> 1:24:59.233
Dig deep!

1:25:19.120 --> 1:25:19.887
There you go.

1:25:19.987 --> 1:25:20.787
What the fuck!

1:25:20.888 --> 1:25:22.522
Wooh!

1:25:29.230 --> 1:25:31.032
Die!

1:25:40.473 --> 1:25:42.076
I'll be back.

1:25:45.846 --> 1:25:47.214
Let's go!

1:25:47.315 --> 1:25:50.851
Wooh! Fuckin' get 'em, boys!

1:25:51.785 --> 1:25:53.486
We can't have a bloodbath.

1:26:04.698 --> 1:26:06.067
You and the commissioner
assured me

1:26:06.167 --> 1:26:07.268
this was a safe zone!

1:26:07.368 --> 1:26:09.303
I have no idea
what's goin' on here!

1:26:09.403 --> 1:26:10.838
You set me up!

1:26:11.005 --> 1:26:12.706
You think that I would sabotage
our entire fuckin' operation?

1:26:12.807 --> 1:26:14.075
Get the fuck out of there.

1:26:14.175 --> 1:26:15.343
Go, get the fuck out.

1:26:31.826 --> 1:26:33.526
Freeze!

1:26:33.626 --> 1:26:35.795
Everybody,
get on the fucking ground!

1:26:44.438 --> 1:26:45.538
Get out of here.

1:26:45.638 --> 1:26:47.975
Drop the weapon, guard!

1:27:22.977 --> 1:27:24.278
Fuck.

1:27:41.996 --> 1:27:43.864
It's me and you now,
motherfucker.

1:27:43.964 --> 1:27:45.698
No, it's just me, motherfucker.

1:27:53.274 --> 1:27:54.607
You're in the system now

1:27:54.707 --> 1:27:56.410
and you leave
when I say you leave.

1:27:56.510 --> 1:27:58.112
Now it's time to fucking go.

1:28:14.161 --> 1:28:14.528
You all right?

1:28:14.661 --> 1:28:15.863
Yes.

1:28:22.002 --> 1:28:22.602
You did it.

1:28:22.702 --> 1:28:24.171
Well done, bro.

1:28:32.179 --> 1:28:33.347
Freeze!

1:28:39.420 --> 1:28:41.956
Fuck you! Oh!

1:28:44.458 --> 1:28:46.060
You know who the fuck I am?

1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:47.928
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:28:48.028 --> 1:28:50.297
Look at me, motherfucker.

1:28:50.397 --> 1:28:52.632
I ain't goin' nowhere! Nowhere!

1:28:52.732 --> 1:28:54.268
I'm the fuckin' law.

1:28:54.368 --> 1:28:56.137
You'll be in fucking lockdown!

1:28:56.237 --> 1:28:57.872
I'll be back, boy!

1:28:59.340 --> 1:29:00.875
I am the fuckin' law!

1:29:00.975 --> 1:29:03.110
Get your fuckin'-- get off!

1:29:03.210 --> 1:29:05.112
Get down, get down!

1:29:06.380 --> 1:29:08.516
Hands up, hands up!

1:29:08.616 --> 1:29:09.383
Hands, hands!

1:29:09.517 --> 1:29:11.051
Let me see your hands!

1:29:23.497 --> 1:29:25.099
Why am I in here

1:29:25.966 --> 1:29:28.068
and is this shit over with yet?

1:29:29.403 --> 1:29:31.771
I was able to use the video
on the chip you gave me

1:29:31.872 --> 1:29:33.841
to get the state authorities
involved

1:29:33.941 --> 1:29:35.775
and to bring the corruption
in this facility

1:29:35.876 --> 1:29:37.311
to their attention.

1:29:38.479 --> 1:29:41.815
And I think you should know,
the commissioner,

1:29:41.916 --> 1:29:43.384
he's in custody, too.

1:29:44.451 --> 1:29:45.752
You see it's hard to regulate

1:29:45.853 --> 1:29:48.088
these corporate
prison institutions.

1:29:48.189 --> 1:29:50.624
We just have no control over
these private penitentiaries,

1:29:50.723 --> 1:29:53.760
so your evidence pushes the case
for regulation.

1:29:54.562 --> 1:29:55.695
I mean regardless

1:29:55.896 --> 1:29:57.730
of what the men
inside these walls have done,

1:29:58.432 --> 1:30:00.534
they're still human beings

1:30:00.634 --> 1:30:03.037
and they deserve
to be treated as such.

1:30:04.471 --> 1:30:07.441
The state has also agreed
to give you a full pardon.

1:30:13.380 --> 1:30:15.449
I-- I coordinated
with the secretary's office

1:30:15.549 --> 1:30:18.085
for you to be released today.

1:30:26.360 --> 1:30:27.928
Thank you.

1:30:30.598 --> 1:30:31.832
The state has also agreed

1:30:31.932 --> 1:30:34.935
to take care of your daughter's
medical costs.

1:30:35.035 --> 1:30:38.038
I mean it's the least
they can do for you, right?

1:30:45.679 --> 1:30:46.981
Maybe.

1:30:49.817 --> 1:30:51.852
Do you need a ride?

1:30:51.952 --> 1:30:53.020
Yeah, I do.

1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:56.624
Just gotta say goodbye
to someone.

1:30:56.724 --> 1:30:57.658
Sure.

1:30:57.757 --> 1:30:59.226
- Okay?
- Yeah.

1:31:08.902 --> 1:31:12.039
Just want you to know
I appreciate you, OG.

1:31:14.308 --> 1:31:17.344
I can't even say thank you
for what you gave me, man.

1:31:17.444 --> 1:31:18.946
Gave you?

1:31:20.247 --> 1:31:21.982
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't be goin' home

1:31:22.082 --> 1:31:24.784
with my daughter right now.

1:31:24.885 --> 1:31:28.055
If it wasn't for you,
I wouldn't care if I was alive.

1:31:29.023 --> 1:31:31.458
That's what you gave me.

1:31:31.558 --> 1:31:34.128
The will
to wanna be alive again.

1:31:34.228 --> 1:31:36.397
Something that I can't
even say thank you for.

1:31:37.598 --> 1:31:38.899
Just don't forget
about a brother

1:31:38.999 --> 1:31:40.601
when you get to the outside,
you know?

1:31:40.701 --> 1:31:42.802
Send somebody back for me.

1:31:44.571 --> 1:31:46.006
My word.

1:31:52.646 --> 1:31:54.315
Stay safe, marine.

1:32:05.726 --> 1:32:09.863
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
- Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:32:12.433 --> 1:32:16.236
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:32:19.139 --> 1:32:23.444
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!
Savage! Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:32:26.714 --> 1:32:29.717
Savage! Savage! Savage!

1:32:29.818 --> 1:32:31.118
Yeah!

1:33:50.330 --> 1:33:52.499
Is my grandmother coming?

1:34:06.079 --> 1:34:07.514
I've been looking for you.

1:34:07.614 --> 1:34:08.348
Daddy!

1:34:15.222 --> 1:34:17.291
Looking everywhere for you.

1:34:18.192 --> 1:34:19.861
You left something.

1:34:27.668 --> 1:34:30.003
Okay, let's get you home.

1:34:43.550 --> 1:34:44.685
Clifford Chambers?

1:34:44.785 --> 1:34:46.153
Yes.

1:34:46.253 --> 1:34:48.789
Terry Savage sent me
to come back for you

1:34:48.890 --> 1:34:51.158
and uh, someone named "Freeway".

1:34:58.232 --> 1:35:00.902
Hey! Fuck you looking at?

1:35:01.001 --> 1:35:03.237
I'm a goddamn warden!

1:35:03.337 --> 1:35:08.041
I got eyes everywhere,
motherfuckers, you hear me?

1:35:10.744 --> 1:35:12.713
Oh God, this ain't real!

1:35:12.814 --> 1:35:14.348
It ain't real!

1:35:14.448 --> 1:35:15.782
Hey, let me out.

1:35:15.884 --> 1:35:17.551
The fuck you waitin' for?

1:35:17.651 --> 1:35:19.753
You know I own this place!

1:35:19.854 --> 1:35:21.555
I own it!

1:35:21.655 --> 1:35:23.457
I own this shit!

1:35:23.557 --> 1:35:25.325
Law, help me!

1:35:25.425 --> 1:35:27.394
Help!
