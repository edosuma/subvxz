00:02.560 --> 00:05.120
Would you want to grow up here?
I have to.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.520
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.520 --> 00:10.960
I was just an average kid
until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.960 --> 00:16.880
One minute I'm walking home,
the next, there's a crash

00:16.880 --> 00:19.720
and I'm drench in some weird chemical.

00:21.320 --> 00:24.320
And since then...
nothing's been the same.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.840
My best friend Ray
think it's cool.

00:40.840 --> 00:44.400
And my sister Annie
thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.680
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.680 --> 00:49.840
Not even my parents.

00:51.360 --> 00:54.160
I know the Chemical Plant
wants to find me

00:54.160 --> 00:55.960
and turn me into some experiment.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.200
But you know something?

00:57.200 --> 01:00.320
I'm guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.599
Junior High is just like I expected.

01:04.599 --> 01:07.920
They take a bunch of
open-minded 12-year-olds

01:07.920 --> 01:11.320
and turn them into rigid
or wellian humanoids.

01:11.320 --> 01:13.680
Didn't do so well
on the science test?

01:13.680 --> 01:15.080
I got a "C".

01:15.080 --> 01:17.920
This whole grading system
needs an overhaul.

01:17.920 --> 01:21.120
- I got a B-minus.
- Is that cool or what?

01:21.120 --> 01:22.320
B-minus?

01:22.320 --> 01:25.120
That's something
to be excited about?

01:25.120 --> 01:28.760
Alex, in our
win-at-all-costs society

01:28.760 --> 01:33.480
- a B-minus is below average.
- No, Nicole, "C" is average.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.840
Oh, so now I'm average?

01:35.840 --> 01:39.480
Nicole, when your sister's
a genius it's hard to get noticed.

01:39.480 --> 01:42.960
A B-minus will at least
get me noticed.

01:43.480 --> 01:46.800
I know, I know.
It looks fabulous.

01:46.800 --> 01:49.440
Mom, Dad,
wait till you hear my news.

01:49.440 --> 01:51.800
Alex, wait, listen to this.

01:51.800 --> 01:55.400
Annie's project was chosen
as a finalist for the Science Fair.

01:55.400 --> 01:59.600
- Can you believe it?
- Of course I can believe it.

01:59.600 --> 02:01.720
Congratulations, Annie.
Again.

02:01.720 --> 02:05.480
- Thanks.
- This year, the Plant is offering

02:05.480 --> 02:08.759
a $5,000 college scholarship
to the winner.

02:08.759 --> 02:11.600
Some Savvy P.R.
thought up by you-know-who.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.920
Annie's project's already
considered the front-runner.

02:14.920 --> 02:18.080
Don't forget about
Carlton Hendy's project, Dad.

02:18.080 --> 02:21.600
So, what scientific frontier
have you conquered now, Annie?

02:21.600 --> 02:25.960
You know, my design
construction and operation

02:25.960 --> 02:28.680
of a continuous-pulsed
ion beam accelerator.

02:31.480 --> 02:34.360
Oh...
Alex, be careful!

02:34.360 --> 02:37.240
Oh, Alex, what is it
you wanted to show us?

02:37.240 --> 02:39.360
Oh, never mind, it was nothing.

02:39.360 --> 02:43.280
Okay.
Um, Alex?

02:43.280 --> 02:46.360
Listen, don't make
any plans for Saturday.

02:46.360 --> 02:50.120
We're going to the Plant
and root Annie on.

02:50.120 --> 02:52.360
The Plant?

02:52.360 --> 02:56.280
- The fair's being held at the Plant?
- Uh-huh.

02:57.920 --> 03:01.480
Um, Mom,
Alex doesn't have to come.

03:01.480 --> 03:04.920
I'm sure she's sick
of witnessing my triumphs.

03:04.920 --> 03:07.560
I am. I really am.

03:07.560 --> 03:11.600
Don't be silly.
We Macks are a team.

03:11.600 --> 03:14.720
You'll do something
great someday, Alex.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.520
And when you do
we'll all be there to support you.

03:22.080 --> 03:26.080
[Annie] Look, Alex, this is not
my fault that Mom and Dad

03:26.080 --> 03:28.960
are making such
a big deal out of this.

03:28.960 --> 03:33.080
Come on, Annie.
You're like little miss perfect.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.440
Compared to you

03:34.440 --> 03:37.080
I'm this insignificant...
insect or something.

03:37.080 --> 03:40.360
Get over it, Alex.
Stop being so jealous.

03:40.360 --> 03:43.880
I don't want to go.

03:45.520 --> 03:46.880
[door opening]

03:46.880 --> 03:48.120
Come on, Alex.

03:48.120 --> 03:50.880
We're leaving for the Plant
in half an hour.

03:50.880 --> 03:53.080
I can't, Mom,
I feel really sick.

03:53.080 --> 03:54.760
I don't know what it is.

03:54.760 --> 03:57.240
Look, Alex
what's going on here?

03:57.240 --> 04:00.680
You feeling a little envious
of your sister?

04:00.680 --> 04:04.840
- I am, but that's not it.
- Well, you feel fine to me.

04:04.840 --> 04:09.160
Well, my throat's really sore
and I have a bad headache.

04:09.160 --> 04:11.520
We'll take your temperature.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.480
- Say "ah."
- Ah.

04:23.560 --> 04:27.200
- You look lovely, Annie.
- Thanks.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.520
Your father is so excited.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.520
You know, there's a chance
that I might not win.

04:32.520 --> 04:35.560
I heard that Carlton's project
is pretty amazing.

04:35.560 --> 04:38.200
We heard that, too,
but you know what?

04:38.200 --> 04:41.240
No matter what happens
we are so proud of you.

04:41.240 --> 04:43.520
Alex, put that in your mouth.

04:47.800 --> 04:51.920
I really don't see
why Alex has to go.

04:51.920 --> 04:54.920
It's my project.
I could care less if...

04:54.920 --> 04:56.320
That's not the point.

04:56.320 --> 05:00.520
I'm sure, in her heart Alex wants
to be there to support you.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.320
Alex, I saw that.

05:04.320 --> 05:07.840
- I don't know what happened.
- You broke the thermometer.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.720
I thought you were too old
to fake being sick

05:10.720 --> 05:12.400
but I guess I was wrong.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.360
Get out of bed, get dressed.

05:14.360 --> 05:18.440
We're going to the Plant
and we'll have fun.

05:22.160 --> 05:24.480
[whispering]:
Nice try.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.880
[man over P.A.]
Students and parents

05:32.880 --> 05:36.560
welcome to the Ninth Annual
Paradise Valley Science Fair.

05:36.560 --> 05:38.840
Please sign in at the front desk.

05:38.840 --> 05:41.800
Collect your badges
at the information desk

05:41.800 --> 05:44.720
located in front
of the Paradise Valley...

05:44.720 --> 05:47.240
Annie, I'm really scared.

05:47.240 --> 05:50.160
You should be.
Don't do anything stupid in there.

05:50.160 --> 05:52.200
- I won't.
- [boy] Annie!

05:52.200 --> 05:53.720
[laughing]

05:53.720 --> 05:55.480
Annie Mack!

05:55.480 --> 05:58.120
- Another battle.
- Carlton.

05:58.120 --> 06:02.160
You know, I heard about
your ion beam accelerator.

06:02.160 --> 06:05.040
Of course, you realize
you have no chance

06:05.040 --> 06:08.160
against my transmission
of holographic interferometry

06:08.160 --> 06:09.840
refraction index changes.

06:09.840 --> 06:13.720
Just like you, Carlton,
to pick a real crowd-pleaser.

06:13.720 --> 06:16.640
From what I hear
your methodology is flawed

06:16.640 --> 06:20.040
and your inconclusive results
stem from the weaknesses

06:20.040 --> 06:21.560
in the experimental design.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.000
But maybe the judges won't notice.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.440
- And where did you hear that?
- It's a small town.

06:27.440 --> 06:30.880
Oh, Carlton,
this is my little sister Alex.

06:30.880 --> 06:34.280
Well, Alex, allow me
to apologize ahead of time

06:34.280 --> 06:37.360
for whipping your older sister's butt.

06:46.240 --> 06:46.960
Hello.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.320
[Mrs Mack]
Hey, come on, kids

06:50.320 --> 06:52.800
I want you to say
hello to Miss Atron.

06:52.800 --> 06:56.320
No!
The place is crawling with kids.

06:56.320 --> 06:57.600
Yes, Miss Atron.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.520
Everything's going just
the way we wanted it to.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.040
Hello, Bonnie.

07:06.040 --> 07:07.800
Barbara.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.160
Oh, of course,
how could I forget?

07:10.160 --> 07:13.400
You remember, uh, my daughters.
This is Alex.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.640
Oh, hello, Alex.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.160
You know, the Plant
is looking for you.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.040
What do you mean?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.240
I mean that you obviously come

07:23.240 --> 07:26.680
from a family with
a strong science background.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.320
We always have
our eyes and ears open

07:29.320 --> 07:31.680
- for the next Gary Mock.
- George.

07:31.680 --> 07:35.320
Mack. Um...
This is our oldest daughter, Annie.

07:35.320 --> 07:37.760
She has a project
in the competition.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.160
Oh, this is Annie.

07:39.160 --> 07:41.720
Hello, it is so good to meet you.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.840
I have heard so much about you
and your project.

07:44.840 --> 07:46.680
What a pleasure.

07:50.520 --> 07:52.800
Alex Mack.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.160
Annie Mack.

07:55.160 --> 07:57.120
Try to calm down a bit.

07:57.120 --> 07:59.840
- I am calm.
- You don't look it.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.680
Will you relax, Annie?

08:01.680 --> 08:05.360
You're the big shot
getting all the attention.

08:05.360 --> 08:10.560
Personally, I hope your ironic
beam accelerator is a big flop.

08:13.880 --> 08:18.880
Ladies and gentlemen
can I have your attention, please?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.040
Miss Danielle Atron.

08:24.920 --> 08:29.320
Ladies and gentlemen welcome.
As the head

08:29.320 --> 08:31.960
of a corporation which prides itself

08:31.960 --> 08:35.240
in always looking
towards the future...

08:35.240 --> 08:38.360
the only person who has
a remote chance of beating me

08:38.360 --> 08:42.039
- is Annie Mack.
- And I'm sick of that happening.

08:42.039 --> 08:46.000
I'm going to make sure
it doesn't happen again.

08:46.000 --> 08:50.080
[Miss Atron] In a few moments
we'll open up the exhibition room

08:50.080 --> 08:52.600
and take a look
at the exceptional work

08:52.600 --> 08:54.800
which these children
have produced.

08:54.800 --> 08:58.840
It gives me such a sense of...

09:05.800 --> 09:07.840
[beeping]

09:07.840 --> 09:11.720
[door clicking open]

09:20.720 --> 09:22.840
[beeping]

09:22.840 --> 09:25.840
[door clicking open]

09:33.920 --> 09:36.760
[beeping]

09:53.800 --> 09:54.880
[zapping]

10:00.040 --> 10:03.280
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.120
That's my sister's.

10:11.000 --> 10:14.120
[alarm blaring]

10:23.480 --> 10:26.600
I think I just realized
you didn't wish me luck.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.720
Are you nervous?

10:42.600 --> 10:44.360
Whoa!

10:44.360 --> 10:46.040
Alex, what did you do to it?

10:46.040 --> 10:48.320
Nothing, Annie, it was Carlton.

10:48.320 --> 10:51.840
He was trying to push it off
and I tried to save it.

10:51.840 --> 10:55.760
I was just outside with Carlton
when the alarms were going off.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.480
I know, 'cause...

10:58.480 --> 11:01.400
Alex wouldn't do
something this destructive.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.280
Have you ever seen her
so jealous before?

11:04.280 --> 11:07.800
She's been trying
to sabotage this all along.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.560
That's not true,
it was an accident, I swear.

11:22.680 --> 11:24.960
- What does it mean?
- We're not sure yet.

11:24.960 --> 11:27.720
The alarms indicate
that a level of GC-161

11:27.720 --> 11:30.200
was released somewhere inside.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.320
We'll have each individual perp
walk through the as-4000 detector.

11:34.320 --> 11:38.440
As they pass through, bang!
A full-body chemical analysis

11:38.440 --> 11:39.760
over the screen.

11:39.760 --> 11:45.480
- I want guards at every door.
- Already done, Miss Atron.

11:49.920 --> 11:51.880
I'm sure we can remount it.

11:51.880 --> 11:55.400
We're not allowed to work
on them once they're here.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.960
- Well, they can make an exception.
- [pounding]

11:58.960 --> 12:02.040
[Vince] Visitors.
We have a problem.

12:02.040 --> 12:05.200
The alarms that you hear
were caused

12:05.200 --> 12:08.160
by a significant
grade "C" chemical reaction

12:08.160 --> 12:10.480
obviously provoked by this accident.

12:10.480 --> 12:15.440
What? My project couldn't have
caused any chemical reations.

12:15.440 --> 12:17.680
I don't know what it can be.

12:17.680 --> 12:20.160
But as long as no one's in danger...

12:20.160 --> 12:22.480
...we're setting up
a testing facility

12:22.480 --> 12:25.080
to see if anybody has
been contaminated.

12:25.080 --> 12:30.040
If so, we'll give them a simple
antidote and everything will be fine.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.600
Thank you.

12:33.800 --> 12:38.160
Vince, Vince,
uh, George Mack, sector "C".

12:38.160 --> 12:40.000
My daughter's project fell.

12:40.000 --> 12:43.320
Can we have a few minutes
to put it back up

12:43.320 --> 12:47.320
from one plant family
member to another?

12:47.320 --> 12:48.720
[laughs]
Absolutely not.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.680
Please exit quickly, Mr. Mock.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.040
Excuse me.

12:59.040 --> 13:04.000
If if you keep your mouth shut
about this maybe, just maybe

13:04.000 --> 13:06.360
your daddy will keep his job.

13:06.360 --> 13:10.640
I'm sure my aunt Danielle
would see to it.

13:27.760 --> 13:31.320
[Annie] Whatever you have
to say, Alex, say it fast.

13:31.320 --> 13:33.720
Right now, I'm ready
to serve you up

13:33.720 --> 13:35.840
to Danielle Atron myself.

13:40.600 --> 13:43.400
Annie, please believe me.
It was Carlton.

13:43.400 --> 13:46.080
I couldn't say this
in front of Mom and Dad

13:46.080 --> 13:48.600
but when I came in
and I saw him trying

13:48.600 --> 13:52.200
to push your project off
the table, I used my powers

13:52.200 --> 13:54.560
to keep it from crashing
to the ground.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.320
In here?
After I warned you?

13:56.320 --> 14:00.080
It was a reflex.
While I held it in the air he snuck out.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.480
Then when the alarms went off

14:02.480 --> 14:05.040
I lost my concentration
and it feel.

14:05.040 --> 14:06.400
I don't buy it, Alex.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.840
Why were you in the exhibition room
in the first place?

14:09.840 --> 14:14.200
When Carlton started talking
about your project I got curious.

14:14.200 --> 14:18.000
I know what it seems like, Annie
but can't you forget about it?

14:18.000 --> 14:21.360
What's going on happen
when I walk through that?

14:24.440 --> 14:28.120
It will probably make you
Danielle Atron's private experiment

14:28.120 --> 14:29.960
which is no problem for me.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.840
That project to took
two years to build.

14:33.480 --> 14:36.840
We've come full circle, Vince.

14:36.840 --> 14:38.880
The kid came back to us.

14:38.880 --> 14:41.960
Obviously a desperate cry
for help, Miss Atron.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.320
Once we're made a positive I.D.

14:44.320 --> 14:45.680
How do we proceed?

14:45.680 --> 14:47.920
It could be traumatic for his family

14:47.920 --> 14:50.840
but there are two ways
to approach them

14:50.840 --> 14:53.720
to ensure cooperation.
One: kindness...

14:53.720 --> 14:55.480
two: money.

14:55.480 --> 14:59.720
I find the latter
usually the most effective.

14:59.720 --> 15:03.280
The important thing is,
is that the child is here

15:03.280 --> 15:06.600
and no one is getting out.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.560
Ladies and gentlemen, we ask
that you line up single file

15:25.560 --> 15:29.080
and go through our system
one at a time.

15:29.080 --> 15:32.320
After this is over
there will be cookies and milk

15:32.320 --> 15:34.600
back in the exhibition room.

15:40.160 --> 15:46.200
Hi... I heard what your sister
did to your entry.

15:46.200 --> 15:49.520
Whew, it's nasty,
this sibling rivalry, huh?

15:49.520 --> 15:51.160
Tough break, though.

15:51.160 --> 15:55.160
Looks like my project,
flawed methodology and all

15:55.160 --> 15:58.000
is going to win.
[chuckles]

16:00.960 --> 16:02.440
[hum]

16:02.440 --> 16:05.520
[mechanical voice]
Status: negative.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.640
[bell rings]

16:17.200 --> 16:18.680
[bell rings]

16:19.200 --> 16:21.320
- This is bad.
- I know it's bad.

16:21.320 --> 16:25.120
Do you swear it was Carlton
that tried to sabotage my project?

16:25.120 --> 16:27.440
Annie, I swear.
If I wanted to do it

16:27.440 --> 16:29.640
why didn't I do it at home?

16:29.640 --> 16:32.760
My trying to save
your project started this.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.800
Look, he's Danielle's nephew.

16:35.800 --> 16:38.520
- Of course he'd do something like this.
- He is?

16:38.520 --> 16:42.920
[Vince] You two girls
talking get back in line.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.440
Get over there.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.920
[whispering] Okay, this is
what we're going to do.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.600
[mechanical voice]
Status: negative.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.680
[bell rings]

17:03.320 --> 17:07.000
- [hum]
- [bell rings]

17:07.000 --> 17:09.599
George. Guess I passed.

17:09.599 --> 17:11.200
[hum]

17:11.200 --> 17:13.800
- Oh! Me too!
- [bell rings]

17:15.160 --> 17:16.410
[hum]

17:19.480 --> 17:22.240
[alarm ringing]

17:36.080 --> 17:39.920
[mechanical voice]
Status: positive, statue: positive.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.320
Grab that kid.

17:44.320 --> 17:48.000
Hey, what are you doing?
Let me go!

17:48.000 --> 17:51.280
I create with these hands!

18:04.280 --> 18:06.840
Shut down the alarms.
Lock the door.

18:06.840 --> 18:08.720
We have the kid.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.440
[zapping]

18:44.440 --> 18:46.960
[buzzing]

19:10.560 --> 19:12.120
I know how you must feel

19:12.120 --> 19:14.280
about what happened
to your ptoject.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.040
We don't have to stay around
for the judging.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.440
No, I'll stay.

19:18.440 --> 19:21.000
I'm just hoping
somebody beats Carlton.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.240
[Mrs Mack]
I kind of feel sorry for him.

19:23.240 --> 19:26.680
You saw what happened
when he went into that detector?

19:26.680 --> 19:29.720
- I hope he's okay.
- I'm sure he's okay.

19:29.720 --> 19:33.320
[singing quietly]

19:33.320 --> 19:39.200
So, seems like you're the one
we've been waiting for, Carlton.

19:39.200 --> 19:42.240
This test will only take a minute.

19:42.240 --> 19:47.280
Ooh, I can imagine your fear, Carlton.

19:47.280 --> 19:51.600
But that's all over with now.

19:51.600 --> 19:55.920
- You're in good hands.
- [humming and beeping]

20:00.040 --> 20:03.400
Hello.
Good to see you.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.520
Bad news, Miss Atron,
it's not him.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.240
Hello, sir.

20:16.240 --> 20:19.160
Very impressive,
Mr. Hendy, as usual.

20:19.160 --> 20:21.840
Huh, do I, uh, at least
get extra points

20:21.840 --> 20:25.000
for the abominable way
I've been treated so far?

20:25.000 --> 20:28.120
No. Are you sure
that this limited a response

20:28.120 --> 20:32.440
- can prove out your theory?
- [snorts] Very sure.

20:32.440 --> 20:35.000
We'll see.

20:40.360 --> 20:43.320
I understand your project met
with some misfortune earlier.

20:43.320 --> 20:46.200
Yes, there was an accident.

20:46.200 --> 20:49.640
Everything seems
to be in order now.

21:03.680 --> 21:06.240
I guess it wasn't
as bad as it looked.

21:06.240 --> 21:10.560
Can you tell me what's
the most important thing

21:10.560 --> 21:12.040
You learned doing this?

21:12.040 --> 21:14.520
Everything I learned
through the project

21:14.520 --> 21:16.600
has given me greater understanding

21:16.600 --> 21:19.560
of the atom and its infinite
uses for humankind.

21:19.560 --> 21:22.240
Very well said, Miss Mack.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.080
[softly] And that my sister
is full of surprises.

21:31.400 --> 21:37.120
And the winner of the
Ninth Annual Science Fair is...

21:42.440 --> 21:46.480
Annie Mack and
her ion beam accelerator.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.720
[cheering and applause]

21:53.840 --> 21:56.160
Go, go, go!

21:57.480 --> 21:59.600
[camera shutters whirring]

22:15.560 --> 22:17.520
[both giggling]

22:17.520 --> 22:19.960
Oh, I'm sorry
about your project, Annie.

22:19.960 --> 22:22.520
It doesn't matter.
I got the trophy!

22:22.520 --> 22:26.200
- Now can we get out of here?
- Yeah.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.440
[giggling]

22:27.440 --> 22:29.720
[zapping]

22:29.720 --> 22:32.080
[sighs and sniffles]

22:32.080 --> 22:34.960
[Annie] Couldn't have
done it without you, Alex.

22:35.240 --> 22:36.640
That's true.

22:37.479 --> 22:41.923
It still wasn't the smartest thing
to do putting yourself at risk

22:41.923 --> 22:43.643
so I could win first prize.

22:43.643 --> 22:45.343
Nothing happened, did it?

22:45.343 --> 22:48.176
You're not going to
hold this against me?

22:48.176 --> 22:50.538
After all the work I did?
No way.

22:50.538 --> 22:54.834
Good for you.
Maybe you're actually maturing.

23:00.950 --> 23:03.166
[laughing]

23:13.807 --> 23:17.788
You're dead.
