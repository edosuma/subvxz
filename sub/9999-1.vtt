03:31.166 --> 03:32.041
No!

03:32.666 --> 03:34.583
No!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.291
My baby.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.250
-Are you OK?
-Mom…

05:34.833 --> 05:36.666
-Yes?
-Did my father come?

05:37.541 --> 05:40.375
-What?
-He visited when I was in intensive care?

05:58.875 --> 06:01.333
I get why you're obsessing over this,
but stop.

06:01.416 --> 06:02.833
You're hurting yourself.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.166
I've told you a thousand times.
He disappeared when I got pregnant.

06:09.250 --> 06:10.583
I never saw him again.

06:14.500 --> 06:19.208
We'll go to Brittany. It'll do you good.
These past few weeks have been so tough.

06:26.208 --> 06:28.916
-I'll be there in two minutes. OK, Mom?
-Yeah.

06:55.625 --> 06:56.958
<i>Monte Carlo Hotel, hi.</i>

06:58.416 --> 07:00.958
-In Monaco?
<i>-No, we're in Saint-Denis.</i>

07:02.458 --> 07:05.041
<i>Can I help you? Do you need information?</i>

07:07.875 --> 07:10.916
<i>-Hello?</i>
-No, sorry. My mistake.

07:11.000 --> 07:11.958
Have a good day.

AUDITION
MAY 3RD!

07:33.958 --> 07:35.291
Come here, sweetheart.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.000
Is everyone there?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.541
WELCOME

07:56.750 --> 07:57.875
What are you doing?

07:58.875 --> 07:59.958
Going to Julien's.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.791
But…

08:03.875 --> 08:07.000
We said we would all be going to Brittany.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.500
You did. I didn't.

08:09.583 --> 08:11.708
I've booked everything. You can't do this.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.416
I don't feel like going to Quiberon.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.416
I can study quietly at Julien's.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.666
Don't worry. It's fine.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.041
We tell each other everything, right?

08:36.833 --> 08:38.125
Take care, princess.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.250
Luce…

08:50.333 --> 08:54.708
You think you saw a guy at the hospital,
and you spoke to a man. Calm down.

08:54.791 --> 08:58.041
-Cool it. It could be nothing.
-Stop it, Ju.

08:58.125 --> 08:59.625
I know she's lying to me.

09:00.291 --> 09:04.000
Why would she call the Monte Carlo Hotel
the day of my accident?

09:04.875 --> 09:06.083
What about the Bird?

09:16.791 --> 09:18.291
It's normal to be scared.

09:18.833 --> 09:19.916
But I'm here for you.

09:21.583 --> 09:24.250
This contest is the opportunity
of a lifetime.

09:37.500 --> 09:38.333
My hair.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
You bastard!

10:19.833 --> 10:22.125

I need a room.

14:07.000 --> 14:08.416
OK. Give me two minutes.

14:29.666 --> 14:34.208
YOUSSEF EL CADI

Here.

15:01.250 --> 15:02.500
Cash only.

15:12.416 --> 15:13.250
I see.

15:20.791 --> 15:21.625
Follow me.

15:33.583 --> 15:34.541
The royal suite.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.833
Living room, desk.

15:37.500 --> 15:38.375
Canopy bed.

15:41.458 --> 15:43.416
For room service, give me a buzz.

15:46.541 --> 15:47.375
OK.

15:48.583 --> 15:49.583
I'm Vincent.

15:50.583 --> 15:51.833
My room is next door.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.041
At your disposal.

16:10.708 --> 16:14.000
THE MONTE CARLO

16:25.791 --> 16:26.625
Come in.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.375
-How are you, Max?
-You?

16:37.833 --> 16:43.375
THE ESCAPEES
REHABILITATION ASSOCIATION

16:50.708 --> 16:51.625
That's illegal.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.208
That kind of position, it's illegal.

17:00.125 --> 17:00.958
Whatcha doing?

17:04.291 --> 17:06.208
-I was looking for you.
-Yeah?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.208
In the keyhole?

17:12.041 --> 17:13.583
We're looking for someone.

17:13.666 --> 17:16.416
-Something different.
-We?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.791
-My partner and I.
-Your partner?

17:18.875 --> 17:21.958
You know,
to join the Cathryn Bird company.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.333
The dance troupe.

17:24.625 --> 17:27.750
-No.
-We're short on time, and we need help.

17:28.750 --> 17:32.041
And you have a good style.
You have ideas… Something.

17:32.125 --> 17:34.250
I don't dance. Must be a dream.

17:37.666 --> 17:40.083
Lots of dancers around here.
You'll find someone.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.666
-No, it's you I want.
-I don't dance anymore.

17:44.250 --> 17:45.083
Drop it.

17:49.541 --> 17:51.708
-Who's in number three?
-Some girl.

17:51.791 --> 17:53.333
She paid in advance. Cash.

17:55.250 --> 17:56.333
What kind of girl?

17:57.916 --> 17:59.416
The cute little ass kind.

18:44.875 --> 18:47.250
Maybe I screwed up, coming here.

18:49.125 --> 18:51.333
<i>-You're sure you're OK?</i>
-Yeah, I'm OK.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.958
I've thought about the Bird.
OK, let's go for it.

18:56.041 --> 18:58.875
-But I want to dance on the floor.
<i>-On the floor?</i>

18:58.958 --> 19:01.291
<i>We suck on the floor!</i>
<i>Three weeks isn't enough.</i>

19:25.375 --> 19:26.500
You sure it's here?

20:01.166 --> 20:02.166
Are you guys lost?

20:03.250 --> 20:05.541
We want to know how to sign up.

20:05.625 --> 20:07.416
-What for?
-For classes.

20:08.041 --> 20:08.875
For classes?

20:11.458 --> 20:12.458
OK, follow me.

20:13.750 --> 20:14.833
I run things here.

20:15.791 --> 20:18.916
In here, you train in your corner.
There's no teacher.

20:19.833 --> 20:23.625
We filter access to avoid overcrowding.
You need to be sponsored.

20:24.416 --> 20:25.500
Someone from here.

20:26.416 --> 20:29.416
Trouble is, you show up here
with no one we know.

20:29.500 --> 20:31.750
Actually, Vincent sent us.

20:32.833 --> 20:33.833
Vincent? Vince?

20:34.458 --> 20:36.000
-Yeah.
-Vince quit dancing.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.416
That's why he's not here, but he sent us.

20:44.000 --> 20:47.708
OK. If Vince sent you, then go ahead.

20:47.791 --> 20:48.625
Thank you.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.291
-Should we go change?
-Yeah, let's go.

21:36.583 --> 21:38.000
Don't give me that look.

21:38.708 --> 21:40.250
Who's the girl over there?

21:40.333 --> 21:41.208
I don't know.

21:42.541 --> 21:44.541
She was looking for dancers.

21:44.625 --> 21:46.833
-You sent her here?
-She sent herself!

21:47.375 --> 21:49.125
She showed up here.

21:51.166 --> 21:52.833
She wants me to coach her.

21:53.708 --> 21:56.416
What kind of coaching?
I'm available anytime!

21:59.500 --> 22:02.500
She's auditioning for a contest
in three weeks.

22:02.583 --> 22:05.041
-Why don't you do it?
-I quit dancing.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.041
You don't need to dance.

22:07.125 --> 22:09.583
Look at Zidane.
Former soccer player, now coach.

22:09.666 --> 22:11.333
He's doing everything right.

22:13.166 --> 22:14.500
You're so dumb.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.750
It's crazy how friends are.

22:21.833 --> 22:24.666
-They fall in love and forget about you.
-What?

22:24.750 --> 22:27.291
You know my chair can't fit
in the elevator.

22:29.625 --> 22:30.458
Come here.

22:35.708 --> 22:36.833
Hey, little shorts!

22:37.750 --> 22:38.750
Hey!

22:38.833 --> 22:41.708
-Fancy a kebab later?
-He wants to hook up.

22:41.791 --> 22:44.208
-Watch out. He's horny.
-Seriously?

22:44.791 --> 22:46.583
-As usual.
-Now you ruined it.

22:46.666 --> 22:48.416
-Little shorts!
-Go again?

22:48.500 --> 22:51.125
Sorry, I can't.
I can't dance in this mess.

22:52.916 --> 22:55.750
Let's go back to Paris.
We have no time for this.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.625
The audition is in three weeks, Lucie.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.750
I'm not your father! I'm not your mother!

24:29.250 --> 24:31.208
You tone it down!

24:34.000 --> 24:36.250
Look after your kids. Show up on time.

24:36.333 --> 24:38.333
I vouched for you with the garage.

24:38.416 --> 24:39.666
Screw the garage!

25:04.000 --> 25:05.625
Hey, Kirikou!

25:05.708 --> 25:07.916
-Are you lost?
-Aren't you cold?

25:08.000 --> 25:10.041
She thinks we're some clowns.

25:10.125 --> 25:11.125
Hey, come here.

25:13.166 --> 25:14.666
Relax.

25:15.750 --> 25:17.666
Who are you calling? Relax.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.500
What's wrong? You're cute.

25:19.583 --> 25:21.458
Want some beer?

25:21.541 --> 25:23.583
Stop knocking. Here's a joint.

25:23.666 --> 25:25.458
-No, thanks.
-It's 11 percent!

25:25.541 --> 25:26.750
She doesn't want it.

25:32.916 --> 25:33.750
Vince.

25:34.750 --> 25:35.583
Parents OK?

25:36.666 --> 25:38.333
David Hasselhoff is here.

25:39.083 --> 25:39.916
Go back home.

25:40.750 --> 25:42.208
-Come on.
-Sorry, bro.

25:44.125 --> 25:45.125
Bastard.

25:45.208 --> 25:47.333
-Thanks.
-Where do you think you are?

25:50.958 --> 25:52.875
Why were you outside half naked?

25:53.666 --> 25:55.291
I don't need a lecture.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.708
I could have managed alone.

26:05.125 --> 26:06.333
You're all animals.

26:07.291 --> 26:09.708
Bullshit. You walk around naked in Paris?

26:09.791 --> 26:12.291
No! It's the same here. Don't be stupid.

26:23.125 --> 26:25.875
MOM
WE JUST ARRIVED IN BRITTANY

26:25.958 --> 26:28.708
WE MISS YOU
SAY HI TO JULIEN

26:48.000 --> 26:51.833
Meet me at 4:00 p.m.
Boulevard de la Liberté. In your gear.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.875
-Thanks.
-Two hundred euros a week for both of you.

27:17.916 --> 27:19.375
Your bag. Come on.

27:23.666 --> 27:25.375
Follow me. Stick close to me.

28:00.125 --> 28:01.916
Watch. Draw energy from it.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.708
DJ Senka!

28:10.958 --> 28:12.166
Faboo!

28:16.666 --> 28:17.958
That's what we like!

28:18.875 --> 28:20.458
B-boy is going for it!

28:24.000 --> 28:25.583
He said, "You're off the beat."

28:30.166 --> 28:31.041
That's insane!

28:40.708 --> 28:42.208
Popping Arnaud!

28:50.208 --> 28:51.166
Let's go!

28:55.000 --> 28:57.333
It's called "popping." He's a killer.

29:08.291 --> 29:09.958
They can dance!

29:13.125 --> 29:14.125
Great!

29:22.083 --> 29:24.291
That means he's stealing moves.

29:24.375 --> 29:25.791
That's the worst insult.

29:26.708 --> 29:27.708
It's wild.

29:28.041 --> 29:29.375
He's starting!

29:34.000 --> 29:34.916
Adrien!

29:35.000 --> 29:37.000
Yeah!

29:39.750 --> 29:41.125
Make some noise!

29:43.416 --> 29:44.625
Cyber-B!

29:46.041 --> 29:48.375
B-boy Mounir! HWE!

29:51.583 --> 29:53.625
You come here!

29:53.708 --> 29:55.125
Come!

29:56.416 --> 29:58.500
What are you gonna do? Get real.

30:05.458 --> 30:07.291
Wiki!

30:12.916 --> 30:14.083
Scores to settle!

30:14.166 --> 30:15.166
Will you shut up?

30:18.875 --> 30:21.333
Watch your mouth! You talk too much.

30:21.416 --> 30:22.916
Look at me!

30:23.000 --> 30:24.541
It's war!

30:24.625 --> 30:26.791
Vince, should we do it now?

30:26.875 --> 30:28.958
Go shave yourself! What?

30:29.041 --> 30:30.250
All right, fine.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.916
Battle!

30:36.208 --> 30:38.208
Cut, please.

30:39.291 --> 30:40.666
Vagabonds!

30:41.125 --> 30:43.541
Battle, now! We'll waste you!

30:44.500 --> 30:47.000
One thousand percent!

30:47.083 --> 30:49.208
Vagabonds, show some balls!

30:49.291 --> 30:52.000
Are you ready for the battles? DJ Senka!

30:52.083 --> 30:55.375
Let's go, baby! Go!

30:55.916 --> 30:58.208
Ready for the battles!

30:58.291 --> 31:01.250
Battle!

31:01.333 --> 31:04.708
Vagabonds! Family! Ready for the battles!

31:04.791 --> 31:06.916
-Let's go!
-Come on, let's go!

31:07.666 --> 31:09.041
Battle royale!

31:24.833 --> 31:25.875
Over to you!

31:27.250 --> 31:30.416
You wanted to be coached, right?
This is it.

31:30.500 --> 31:32.500
One thousand percent!

31:38.000 --> 31:39.291
No, I'm not dancing.

31:41.708 --> 31:44.416
B-boy Mounir! HWE!

31:45.333 --> 31:47.416
Vagabonds!

31:48.458 --> 31:49.916
The audience!

32:19.375 --> 32:21.541
Family! The answer!

32:26.541 --> 32:27.875
It's war!

32:33.666 --> 32:35.000
Yes!

32:39.708 --> 32:40.541
Nice!

32:41.458 --> 32:43.166
Yes!

32:49.375 --> 32:50.208
Here he is!

32:51.041 --> 32:52.500
B-boy Ludo!

33:03.083 --> 33:04.375
Battle royale!

33:05.000 --> 33:06.875
Vagabonds!

33:06.958 --> 33:08.291
It's intense!

33:09.333 --> 33:11.875
They're sending a girl in. It's your turn.

33:17.666 --> 33:18.708
No!

33:24.583 --> 33:25.708
Make some noise!

33:37.083 --> 33:38.250
Nice!

33:38.875 --> 33:41.000
Vagabonds!

33:43.166 --> 33:47.041
B-girl Nagi!

33:50.916 --> 33:54.666
Her moves are shit. It sucks.
Destroy her. OK?

33:55.375 --> 33:58.125
-Trust yourself.
-Go on, Lucie!

34:03.750 --> 34:05.708
Don't let her intimidate you.

34:05.791 --> 34:07.541
Forget about this. It sucks.

34:07.625 --> 34:09.958
-Don't look at her.
-Close your eyes.

34:10.458 --> 34:12.791
-Don't look at her.
-Just get in there.

34:12.875 --> 34:15.833
You go in. You destroy her!
Nothing to lose!

34:15.916 --> 34:17.833
You get in angry!

34:17.916 --> 34:20.791
The audience don't shout until it's over.

34:20.875 --> 34:23.375
Go, even if you're not better than her!

34:23.458 --> 34:24.875
Get in and dance, Lucie!

34:25.708 --> 34:27.000
It's your turn now.

34:32.416 --> 34:34.583
-Go on, Lucie.
-Come on.

34:34.666 --> 34:36.416
Go, Lucie! Get in!

34:36.500 --> 34:38.125
Come on!

34:38.208 --> 34:40.208
Go, Lucie! Gotta get in!

34:40.291 --> 34:42.750
-You can do it.
-Go, dance.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.875
-Don't give up.
-Destroy her.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.625
Come on, Lucie!

34:46.708 --> 34:48.166
Don't give up. Get in!

34:48.250 --> 34:49.541
I can't!

34:49.625 --> 34:50.875
I can't go!

35:32.625 --> 35:34.458
Would your dad be proud of you?

35:36.041 --> 35:38.291
It's 7:55 p.m. Stop playing with fire.

35:39.500 --> 35:41.666
I'm working the bar. Is that normal?

35:43.000 --> 35:44.416
Come on. Go get changed.

35:48.041 --> 35:51.750
That's battle. For each blow,
you either get up or give up.

35:51.833 --> 35:55.250
Don't dance if you're scared.
At least you tried to get in.

35:56.833 --> 35:59.250
What about you? Did you freak out?

35:59.833 --> 36:01.541
No, I'm just not your puppet.

36:04.166 --> 36:05.000
Go stretch.

36:07.041 --> 36:08.500
Who does he think he is?

36:08.583 --> 36:10.958
Look at the level here! We will need it.

36:11.375 --> 36:13.583
He's been humiliating us.

36:13.666 --> 36:14.875
And we pay for that.

36:14.958 --> 36:15.791
Hey.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.833
You talk and stretch there. We train here.

36:23.541 --> 36:26.416
<i>Fifteen days isn't much.</i>
<i>We'll maximize time.</i>

36:26.500 --> 36:28.333
<i>We need something original.</i>

36:28.416 --> 36:30.500
We're going to do another move.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.458
<i>We all try to stand out here.</i>

36:33.416 --> 36:37.000
Look at him. We call him Wiki.
Our Wikipedia of breaking.

36:37.083 --> 36:38.750
He knows everything.

36:38.833 --> 36:42.375
He's in the flow.
That's called "abstract." Very musical.

36:44.208 --> 36:46.625
Come on, Lucie! Breathe!

36:46.708 --> 36:48.833
Meda. A real character!

36:48.916 --> 36:51.166
He's a wild dancer. A battle icon.

36:51.250 --> 36:53.000
Don't give up! Keep at it!

36:53.791 --> 36:55.958
That's Lumberjack. Quick, strong…

36:56.041 --> 36:58.208
He's a power move pro. A beast.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.000
-All right?
-Yeah.

37:03.083 --> 37:04.791
<i>You've learned in a studio.</i>

37:04.875 --> 37:07.083
<i>You can tell. No originality.</i>

37:07.166 --> 37:08.916
<i>-But we'll work on it.</i>
-Up.

37:09.000 --> 37:11.666
You have no technique,
but you have something.

37:11.750 --> 37:13.541
Magnetic. That's rare.

37:46.041 --> 37:47.041
I did it!

37:53.708 --> 37:54.833
MOM

37:59.291 --> 38:00.916
My shoulder!

38:01.000 --> 38:01.833
Don't move.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.166
Get up.

38:28.833 --> 38:30.500
No, Lucie, that's no good.

38:31.583 --> 38:32.791
Slide on your elbow.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.833
Then you can add variations.

38:49.750 --> 38:50.833
Injuries happen.

38:54.708 --> 38:55.708
He's fast, huh?

38:56.291 --> 38:59.750
You know why French B-boys
are faster than the Americans?

38:59.833 --> 39:01.416
In the early days,

39:01.500 --> 39:04.625
the French studied
the videos made by the Americans.

39:04.708 --> 39:07.625
But when you put their tapes
in our players,

39:07.708 --> 39:08.958
the video sped up.

39:09.041 --> 39:12.000
So, they became that much faster.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.166
-Malik.
-Hi.

39:13.250 --> 39:15.083
-Nice to meet you.
-Julien.

39:15.166 --> 39:17.375
-How are you?
-That's all for today.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.416
See you tomorrow.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.833
-You danced, Vincent.
-What?

39:21.916 --> 39:23.833
-I saw you dancing.
-No.

39:23.916 --> 39:26.458
-I did an elbow slide.
-Come here.

39:28.166 --> 39:29.500
Come here. You danced.

39:30.208 --> 39:31.750
You're annoying. Really.

39:32.333 --> 39:33.166
Vincent.

39:33.916 --> 39:36.333
I swear on my mom's life, it's important.

39:37.791 --> 39:39.333
-You danced.
-OK.

39:40.166 --> 39:41.000
You done?

40:57.875 --> 41:02.125
THE MAX METHOD

41:02.208 --> 41:06.291
THE EX-CON IS HELPING
FORMER CONVICTS REHABILITATE

41:06.375 --> 41:08.500
MAX, YOUNGEST CHAMPION IN EUROPE

41:08.583 --> 41:11.708
MAX IS SENTENCED TO 10 YEARS
FOR A HOLDUP IN 1994

41:22.958 --> 41:24.416
What are you doing here?

41:27.041 --> 41:29.041
The audition's tomorrow. I'm beat.

41:29.125 --> 41:30.250
Are you for real?

41:30.333 --> 41:32.166
You're in my boss' office. Why?

41:32.833 --> 41:35.333
It's a long story. I need to stay focused.

41:35.416 --> 41:37.333
I swear I'll tell you tomorrow.

42:03.500 --> 42:04.916
What do I do about this?

42:06.208 --> 42:07.041
It's nothing.

42:17.708 --> 42:18.708
Show me.

42:26.958 --> 42:28.208
You're a real dancer now.

42:35.458 --> 42:37.708
Stress is your worst enemy. Not this.

42:39.333 --> 42:40.500
OK? Breathe.

42:47.041 --> 42:47.875
There.

42:51.416 --> 42:53.416
I used to do this before my shows.

42:55.208 --> 42:56.166
Close your eyes.

42:57.583 --> 43:00.375
Here. Go over all your moves in your mind.

43:01.541 --> 43:03.541
Slowly. Breathe.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.458
You'll get on stage, and you'll be fine.

43:35.416 --> 43:36.250
Kiss me.

43:37.625 --> 43:38.458
What?

43:39.458 --> 43:40.291
Kiss me.

43:42.791 --> 43:43.708
Twenty seconds.

43:46.208 --> 43:47.041
Ju, I…

43:48.666 --> 43:49.666
Fifteen seconds.

43:54.375 --> 43:55.291
Ten seconds.

45:16.416 --> 45:17.458
I love you.

47:02.416 --> 47:03.666
Was this a break-up?

47:05.333 --> 47:07.166
Thanks. See you in three weeks.

47:07.708 --> 47:08.541
Thank you.

47:11.208 --> 47:17.541
AUDITION
CATHRYN BIRD

47:36.375 --> 47:38.458
What were you waiting for?

47:39.500 --> 47:41.708
-For me to be in a hospital?
-Get out.

47:42.708 --> 47:44.208
Come on. Tell me.

47:44.291 --> 47:46.916
What am I to you? What am I worth?

47:51.000 --> 47:51.958
Fuck.

47:52.041 --> 47:57.125
I've been in your damn hotel for days now.
You don't even notice me.

47:58.458 --> 48:00.000
I don't know why I'm here.

48:01.250 --> 48:03.041
You're the girl in room three?

48:06.583 --> 48:07.541
Anything else?

48:14.333 --> 48:17.250
My birth date on your arm,
does it ease your conscience?

48:37.458 --> 48:38.291
What's wrong?

48:39.666 --> 48:42.458
I expected a bastard,
and I get a major bastard.

48:43.833 --> 48:44.791
Who do you mean?

48:46.208 --> 48:48.416
Know what the number is on Max's arm?

48:50.458 --> 48:52.916
His prison number?

48:53.791 --> 48:56.916
No, it's my birth date.
The bastard is my father.

49:54.833 --> 49:55.958
What are you doing?

49:57.000 --> 49:58.833
I'm out of here. I'm done here.

50:07.000 --> 50:07.833
Stop.

50:09.041 --> 50:10.666
Let me show you something.

50:10.750 --> 50:12.750
No, I can't. I'm going home now.

50:12.833 --> 50:14.541
Sure, but come with me first.

50:15.541 --> 50:17.666
What difference will two hours make?

50:26.000 --> 50:27.958
<i>You know we're not pals</i>
<i>Move, you stink</i>

50:28.041 --> 50:30.333
<i>Even on your chair</i>
<i>You roll your hips</i>

50:30.416 --> 50:33.083
<i>I'm gonna kill you</i>
<i>There will be no more pulse</i>

50:33.166 --> 50:35.291
<i>As much chance of winning</i>
<i>As of running away</i>

50:35.375 --> 50:38.291
<i>I know how to rap</i>
<i>My talent will end you</i>

50:38.375 --> 50:40.875
<i>Get out of here</i>
<i>No handicapped parking spot</i>

50:40.958 --> 50:43.041
<i>You better shut up</i>
<i>You're losing your hair</i>

50:43.125 --> 50:45.375
<i>Lower your eyes</i>
<i>I'll slash your tires</i>

50:47.416 --> 50:50.000
<i>-</i>That's pretty violent, no?
-He'll answer.

50:50.083 --> 50:52.500
<i>With your lame look</i>
<i>Like you're Malcolm X</i>

50:52.583 --> 50:55.125
<i>But chill, bro</i>
<i>You're in the wrong place</i>

50:55.208 --> 50:58.166
<i>I'm Malik</i>
<i>People call me the king of the scene</i>

50:58.250 --> 51:01.208
<i>On my stage, you can only be a queen</i>
<i>Look at you!</i>

51:01.291 --> 51:03.000
<i>You look like a caramel chew</i>

51:03.083 --> 51:05.000
<i>Here! Take these 40 I have on me</i>

51:05.083 --> 51:07.625
<i>Look, he's proud</i>
<i>But he's worried now</i>

51:07.708 --> 51:10.458
<i>Usually when you lose</i>
<i>You call for your big bro</i>

51:11.083 --> 51:13.333
<i>You turn up here to be a starlet</i>

51:13.416 --> 51:15.875
<i>But you just got wasted</i>
<i>By a guy on wheels</i>

51:18.583 --> 51:19.958
Nice romantic evening.

51:21.166 --> 51:22.833
Who said it'd be romantic?

51:27.375 --> 51:30.291
-What's the deal with that bastard?
-What?

51:30.375 --> 51:31.333
Your bastard.

51:33.666 --> 51:35.291
And you? Why prison?

51:38.125 --> 51:39.541
You tell me, I tell you.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.000
Drug trafficking.

51:43.458 --> 51:44.541
Yeah?

51:44.625 --> 51:46.166
I needed cash for a pal.

51:48.166 --> 51:50.208
I was the driver. I got caught.

51:52.916 --> 51:56.833
OK. Not gonna stick with you,
I might get in trouble.

51:56.916 --> 51:59.958
Hold on. We had a deal. The bastard.

52:00.791 --> 52:02.791
-Tell me.
-There's nothing to tell.

52:03.291 --> 52:05.458
I tell you everything, that's all I get?

52:05.541 --> 52:06.625
That's all I have.

52:07.000 --> 52:08.583
That's the first time we spoke.

52:09.458 --> 52:11.458
You know more about him than I do.

52:13.666 --> 52:16.125
I had a fall, doing air dancing.

52:16.208 --> 52:17.250
I was in a coma.

52:18.916 --> 52:20.333
He came to the hospital.

52:22.625 --> 52:23.458
That was it.

52:29.541 --> 52:30.375
Shit.

52:32.166 --> 52:33.750
I have to go. Come on!

52:44.083 --> 52:46.125
Fuck. 7:59 p.m.

52:47.000 --> 52:47.916
That was close.

52:48.958 --> 52:51.208
In <i>Cinderella,</i> it's the girl who runs.

52:53.250 --> 52:55.083
This isn't a Mickey cartoon.

52:55.166 --> 52:58.000
With this, 8:00 p.m. is the limit.
No choice.

52:58.083 --> 53:00.291
-What if you're late?
-Prison.

53:06.416 --> 53:08.041
Thanks for my last evening.

53:10.875 --> 53:11.708
Hold on.

53:16.791 --> 53:17.750
Are you serious?

53:18.500 --> 53:20.333
You're gonna give up like that?

53:23.666 --> 53:25.750
My bastard father won't talk to me.

53:26.458 --> 53:27.833
I have lost my partner…

53:28.750 --> 53:30.291
I have had all I can take.

53:35.083 --> 53:36.833
I have an idea for your partner.

53:46.125 --> 53:48.958
-I need to change for…
-Yeah.

53:49.833 --> 53:51.958
-I have my evening shift.
-OK.

54:44.625 --> 54:46.250
Malik, that shit's wild.

54:48.083 --> 54:48.958
Wild, man.

54:50.583 --> 54:52.000
I thought you'd like it.

54:53.333 --> 54:55.208
Lucie, look at me.

54:58.500 --> 55:01.625
Dance with the shadow.
The final has to be big.

55:01.708 --> 55:03.458
We'll mix in aerial dance.

55:03.541 --> 55:05.208
Malik is great with video.

55:05.291 --> 55:07.291
He'll add some wild effects.

55:07.375 --> 55:09.375
Trust us. It'll be awesome.

55:09.458 --> 55:11.375
Really? You won't dance with me?

55:12.583 --> 55:14.333
Coaching and direction.

55:14.416 --> 55:16.375
Your partner idea was the shadow?

55:18.625 --> 55:20.125
Start training with Wiki.

55:21.125 --> 55:22.750
-I have to go.
-Malik!

55:23.625 --> 55:24.875
What? He won't dance?

55:31.541 --> 55:32.375
Vincent!

55:36.375 --> 55:37.791
Vincent, I don't get it.

55:38.791 --> 55:40.500
You dance. You're the shadow!

55:41.416 --> 55:44.958
The final's at 8:00 p.m.
I can't do it with my ankle monitor.

55:46.666 --> 55:48.166
The shadow is all I have.

55:50.041 --> 55:50.875
Your choice.

56:16.208 --> 56:17.041
OK.

56:19.250 --> 56:21.166
-OK what?
-For the shadow. OK.

56:36.291 --> 56:37.291
Dance.

56:37.833 --> 56:39.166
-What?
-Go on.

56:45.958 --> 56:46.791
OK.

56:52.666 --> 56:53.583
What is this?

56:54.708 --> 56:57.291
-You asked me to dance.
-That's dancing?

56:59.000 --> 56:59.833
Come here.

57:00.666 --> 57:02.666
Move. I want to see you dance.

57:11.750 --> 57:12.583
What is this?

57:16.291 --> 57:17.875
What I saw the first time…

57:19.083 --> 57:21.583
It was powerful.
That's what I want to see.

57:21.666 --> 57:24.000
That's why I agreed to help you.
Start again.

57:30.541 --> 57:31.833
More impact! Now!

57:35.791 --> 57:37.458
No, start again. Back to me.

57:37.541 --> 57:38.958
Five, six, seven, eight!

57:41.833 --> 57:43.833
On the floor! Follow through! One!

57:44.916 --> 57:46.458
Stop thinking. Do it!

57:47.208 --> 57:48.041
Get back up.

57:49.416 --> 57:51.000
Look at me. Use this.

57:52.000 --> 57:54.375
Come on, start with your arm. One!

57:58.916 --> 57:59.750
On the floor.

58:02.916 --> 58:06.458
There. One, two, three, four!

58:06.541 --> 58:08.458
Good! OK, get up.

58:09.541 --> 58:10.541
More impact! Go!

58:10.625 --> 58:11.541
Don't stop.

58:38.250 --> 58:40.666
Barking at her won't help.

58:42.583 --> 58:44.291
When guys come out of prison,

58:44.916 --> 58:47.916
what they need most is encouragement.

58:48.916 --> 58:50.125
Someone who listens.

58:51.250 --> 58:54.083
I don't just fill out their forms
and find them work.

58:54.916 --> 58:57.166
I mostly listen to them.

58:57.250 --> 58:58.916
Try to give them confidence.

59:02.000 --> 59:03.625
Change how you see her.

59:04.458 --> 59:06.458
Help her see her potential.

59:08.000 --> 59:09.500
Stop stressing her flaws.

59:10.375 --> 59:11.458
It won't help her.

59:15.500 --> 59:16.333
Good night.

59:17.958 --> 59:18.791
Good night.

59:24.041 --> 59:25.708
Lucie, you're a dancer.

59:26.208 --> 59:28.000
A real one. No doubt about it.

59:28.708 --> 59:31.875
You're in the zone sometimes.
But I want you in it all the time.

59:34.541 --> 59:36.208
Forget everything. Everyone.

59:37.166 --> 59:38.291
Dance for yourself.

59:39.041 --> 59:40.000
Close your eyes.

59:50.583 --> 59:52.375
There. Let the music fill you.

59:53.250 --> 59:54.166
Take your time.

59:55.166 --> 59:56.750
There. Get into it.

59:58.000 --> 59:59.833
It's between you and the music.

1:00:01.958 --> 1:00:04.791
And go! Every movement at full strength.

1:00:05.458 --> 1:00:06.291
That's it.

1:00:09.458 --> 1:00:10.291
Yes!

1:00:12.750 --> 1:00:13.583
Hit it!

1:00:16.291 --> 1:00:17.250
Now, look at me.

1:00:22.458 --> 1:00:23.291
One!

1:00:27.500 --> 1:00:28.333
Keep going!

1:00:29.333 --> 1:00:30.166
That's good.

1:00:33.541 --> 1:00:35.083
Come on, boom! Yes!

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:42.583
On the floor now! Boom!

1:00:44.541 --> 1:00:46.083
One, and two!

1:00:50.625 --> 1:00:52.500
And get back up, always!

1:00:54.375 --> 1:00:55.208
That's it.

1:01:02.708 --> 1:01:05.666
Be in sync,
because the shadow won't adapt to you.

1:01:06.375 --> 1:01:08.083
Any delay, and it's over.

1:01:08.166 --> 1:01:11.291
We blend floor and aerial work.
You chase the shadow.

1:01:11.375 --> 1:01:13.541
Shadow on the floor, you on the cloth.

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:27.916
There are mattresses, Lucie. You're safe.

1:02:11.916 --> 1:02:13.250
What is he doing here?

1:02:13.333 --> 1:02:16.458
What is he doing here? Why?

1:02:24.125 --> 1:02:25.625
You need time.

1:02:25.708 --> 1:02:27.750
<i>She nearly falls each time.</i>

1:02:27.833 --> 1:02:29.416
I don't want to force her.

1:02:30.291 --> 1:02:34.583
It doesn't matter how many times you fall,
as long as you get back up.

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:37.916
<i>Falling, getting up, it's how you learn.</i>

1:02:45.166 --> 1:02:47.250
<i>Make her feel that she can do it.</i>

1:02:48.125 --> 1:02:49.333
<i>Then, she'll do it.</i>

1:02:50.125 --> 1:02:51.666
<i>Reassure her. Tell her…</i>

1:02:51.750 --> 1:02:52.916
No pressure.

1:02:53.541 --> 1:02:55.875
If you want, we'll find something else.

1:02:57.458 --> 1:02:58.875
OK? We'll figure it out.

1:03:48.541 --> 1:03:49.541
There. That's it!

1:03:50.750 --> 1:03:51.583
Good, Lucie!

1:03:55.833 --> 1:03:57.416
-Well done.
-Thank you!

1:04:04.041 --> 1:04:05.666
How about that kebab, baby?

1:04:08.583 --> 1:04:09.416
When?

1:04:10.500 --> 1:04:11.916
What are you doing here?

1:04:12.000 --> 1:04:13.041
Seen the time?

1:04:13.125 --> 1:04:14.916
-What time is it?
-7:52 p.m.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.875
You won't make it even if you run!

1:04:17.708 --> 1:04:19.666
You wanna do more time?

1:04:19.750 --> 1:04:21.500
Don't worry. It's a loan.

1:04:29.208 --> 1:04:30.458
Max will kick my ass.

1:04:31.083 --> 1:04:32.916
Scared he'll catch you with me?

1:04:33.833 --> 1:04:34.833
No one scares me.

1:04:48.666 --> 1:04:50.125
Vincent, get to work!

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.916
I know you're here. The cops didn't call.

1:04:58.541 --> 1:04:59.375
I have to go.

1:05:00.041 --> 1:05:01.541
No one scares you, right?

1:05:24.375 --> 1:05:28.250
FINISHED WORK AT 2 A.M.
DIDN'T WANT TO WAKE YOU

1:05:28.333 --> 1:05:30.708
I HOPE YOU SLEPT WELL

1:05:39.375 --> 1:05:40.208
DAD

1:05:40.291 --> 1:05:42.375
LUCIE, WE'RE WORRIED
ANSWER, PLEASE

1:05:43.875 --> 1:05:44.833
LUCIE

1:05:44.916 --> 1:05:48.083
I'M FINE, DAD
I'M STUDYING FOR MY EXAMS AT JULIEN'S

1:05:56.500 --> 1:05:58.041
That move's not good.

1:05:58.125 --> 1:06:00.208
-That one?
-You need to do it again.

1:06:01.083 --> 1:06:02.291
I'll do it tomorrow.

1:06:03.625 --> 1:06:04.458
Tomorrow?

1:06:06.291 --> 1:06:09.083
There's one move to redo.
You do it. We're good.

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:10.958
No.

1:06:12.291 --> 1:06:14.000
Why do you always flake out on me?

1:06:14.083 --> 1:06:15.625
You can't do one move?

1:06:16.166 --> 1:06:17.750
I'll do it tomorrow!

1:06:17.833 --> 1:06:19.583
I don't feel like it now!

1:06:19.666 --> 1:06:21.458
You never feel like it!

1:06:21.541 --> 1:06:23.333
-Where are you going?
-I'm out.

1:06:23.833 --> 1:06:25.250
I'm not dancing anymore.

1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.208
-What's wrong?
-Isn't it in four days?

1:06:30.583 --> 1:06:33.000
Go rehearse unless you wanna ruin it all.

1:06:56.166 --> 1:07:00.000
WE THOUGHT HE'D GO BACK TO DANCE,
THAT WE SHOULDN'T TALK ABOUT IT

1:07:00.833 --> 1:07:03.666
<i>A battle of crews! They're ready!</i>

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:04.833
<i>What choreography!</i>

1:07:05.750 --> 1:07:07.208
<i>Family, answer!</i>

1:07:07.291 --> 1:07:10.375
<i>It's got to be sick! You got to kick ass!</i>

1:07:10.458 --> 1:07:12.375
<i>Malik, let's do the catapult!</i>

1:07:12.458 --> 1:07:14.625
<i>-I'm not ready.</i>
<i>-We do it now.</i>

1:07:14.708 --> 1:07:16.041
<i>-No.</i>
<i>-Don't worry.</i>

1:07:16.125 --> 1:07:18.125
<i>I'll throw you and I'll catch you!</i>

1:07:18.208 --> 1:07:20.250
<i>-The answer!</i>
<i>-I'm ready.</i>

1:07:20.333 --> 1:07:22.833
<i>Don't worry, bro. Five, six, seven, go!</i>

1:07:22.916 --> 1:07:25.500
<i>Fuck! Vincent threw Malik into the air!</i>

1:07:26.416 --> 1:07:28.333
<i>-Malik!</i>
<i>-Shit!</i>

1:07:29.041 --> 1:07:31.416
<i>-Move out of the way!</i>
<i>-Move.</i>

1:07:31.500 --> 1:07:34.375
<i>-Give him some air.</i>
<i>-Call an ambulance!</i>

1:07:34.458 --> 1:07:36.083
<i>-Malik!</i>
<i>-Move out--</i>

1:09:47.041 --> 1:09:48.041
MOM

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:52.916
I TALKED TO JULIEN
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHERE YOU ARE

1:10:06.291 --> 1:10:07.458
I made you dance.

1:10:13.083 --> 1:10:14.583
I want to dance with you.

1:10:19.500 --> 1:10:21.416
You were made for this, Vincent.

1:10:40.791 --> 1:10:43.583
Why didn't you say anything?
You have no right!

1:10:44.625 --> 1:10:45.458
Lucie!

1:10:54.500 --> 1:10:55.833
I know I lied to you,

1:10:55.916 --> 1:10:56.916
but…

1:10:59.500 --> 1:11:01.625
-I did what I could.
-Lucie…

1:11:02.416 --> 1:11:04.916
-Can we talk about it at home?
-No.

1:11:09.125 --> 1:11:10.958
Honey, please come home.

1:11:11.041 --> 1:11:12.625
-Please.
-Stop.

1:11:18.958 --> 1:11:21.500
This isn't your world.
This isn't your life.

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:25.583
Don't you think I tried to save Max?

1:11:34.416 --> 1:11:36.958
I don't care how, but bring her back home.

1:12:40.333 --> 1:12:41.166
Vincent!

1:12:42.166 --> 1:12:43.541
Vincent, were you watching?

1:12:45.166 --> 1:12:46.375
Vincent?

1:12:46.458 --> 1:12:47.291
What's wrong?

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.458
You wanted me to dance? Over to you now.

1:13:06.875 --> 1:13:08.166
-I--
-Dance!

1:13:19.250 --> 1:13:21.000
Hey, what's up with you?

1:13:21.083 --> 1:13:22.458
It's what you all want!

1:13:26.750 --> 1:13:28.333
-Vincent!
-Vince!

1:13:29.208 --> 1:13:30.208
Stop now! Enough!

1:13:30.875 --> 1:13:33.083
You gonna get out of your chair, huh?

1:13:34.208 --> 1:13:36.416
-What's wrong, Vincent?
-What's wrong?

1:13:37.958 --> 1:13:38.875
What's wrong?

1:13:39.791 --> 1:13:40.708
What about you?

1:13:41.875 --> 1:13:44.083
What do you want, Lucie?

1:13:45.333 --> 1:13:47.250
If I do it, I'm going to prison!

1:13:49.166 --> 1:13:50.416
Wake up, dammit!

1:13:50.500 --> 1:13:52.750
You don't know what I've been through.

1:13:53.500 --> 1:13:55.458
You have it all. I have nothing!

1:13:58.250 --> 1:14:00.250
I'm not your puppet, not anyone's.

1:14:00.750 --> 1:14:04.833
Want to connect with your dad?
Go to your dad, but leave me out of it.

1:14:06.666 --> 1:14:08.166
We should never have met.

1:14:11.291 --> 1:14:12.791
But Vincent, I love you--

1:14:13.833 --> 1:14:14.916
You love yourself.

1:14:15.416 --> 1:14:16.833
The rest can go to hell.

1:14:18.166 --> 1:14:20.958
You use everyone.
Your old man, your parents…

1:14:21.583 --> 1:14:24.416
The other guy you just dumped. Julien.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:27.833
To get me.

1:15:16.166 --> 1:15:17.875
Why did you come to see me?

1:15:20.083 --> 1:15:21.583
That was a mistake.

1:15:25.250 --> 1:15:26.250
Lucie…

1:15:29.791 --> 1:15:31.041
you have a good life.

1:15:31.791 --> 1:15:33.000
A supportive family.

1:15:33.750 --> 1:15:37.125
Your studies.
You don't realize how lucky you are.

1:15:40.291 --> 1:15:42.791
You and Vincent should never have met.

1:15:42.875 --> 1:15:46.416
-What do I do if I love him?
-What if he goes back to prison?

1:15:46.916 --> 1:15:48.750
He's losing it. It has to stop.

1:15:50.208 --> 1:15:53.041
Whenever he wants to help someone,
it ends badly.

1:15:53.958 --> 1:15:56.583
Two years inside
when he tried to help Malik.

1:15:58.041 --> 1:16:00.000
He slips up again, it's back in.

1:16:00.083 --> 1:16:01.791
He can only count on himself.

1:16:02.541 --> 1:16:03.833
That kid has no one.

1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:07.000
You're the one with no one,
apart from him.

1:16:10.708 --> 1:16:13.291
THE MONTE CARLO

1:16:28.583 --> 1:16:29.833
You keep screwing up.

1:16:31.208 --> 1:16:34.958
This girl's your chance.
Go for it. Live your life.

1:16:36.458 --> 1:16:38.291
Go for it? Go where? To prison?

1:16:40.833 --> 1:16:42.250
How do I live with that?

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:43.958
Are you serious?

1:16:45.833 --> 1:16:47.500
And how do I live with this?

1:16:49.291 --> 1:16:50.250
I live, period.

1:16:51.125 --> 1:16:51.958
No choice.

1:16:52.750 --> 1:16:53.833
You die otherwise.

1:16:56.041 --> 1:16:57.541
Forget the ankle monitor.

1:16:58.583 --> 1:17:00.541
It's been in here since the accident.

1:17:06.041 --> 1:17:06.875
Vincent.

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:10.333
Vincent!

1:17:14.916 --> 1:17:17.000
When you have time, listen to this.

1:19:17.541 --> 1:19:19.166
When your mom got pregnant,

1:19:21.083 --> 1:19:21.916
I got scared.

1:19:25.666 --> 1:19:27.083
Back then, I thought

1:19:27.166 --> 1:19:29.666
a penniless man couldn't be a good father.

1:19:31.333 --> 1:19:32.791
Then, things happened.

1:19:33.958 --> 1:19:36.833
Once I went to prison,
I didn't see what I could give you.

1:19:39.416 --> 1:19:40.250
I played dead.

1:19:43.666 --> 1:19:46.166
I thought it was best
for you and your mom.

1:19:48.500 --> 1:19:51.208
You tell yourself crap
and end up believing it.

1:19:53.833 --> 1:19:56.166
It was the worst mistake of my life.

1:19:58.333 --> 1:20:00.000
But there's no turning back.

1:20:06.250 --> 1:20:09.333
I have accepted
the years I lost in prison.

1:20:12.250 --> 1:20:13.750
The harm I did to people.

1:20:15.208 --> 1:20:17.125
But what I still can't accept is

1:20:18.083 --> 1:20:19.416
the harm I did to you.

1:20:25.791 --> 1:20:28.458
I hope you'll find
the strength to forgive me.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.375
I want you to know

1:20:32.291 --> 1:20:36.583
that not a day went by
I didn't think of you. Not one.

1:20:39.708 --> 1:20:42.416
-I'm happy you're part of my life.
-Me too.

1:20:48.750 --> 1:20:50.583
-I have to go now.
-No.

1:21:21.500 --> 1:21:24.416
<i>You let your heart die for others, bro</i>

1:21:24.958 --> 1:21:28.208
<i>You fed your melancholy</i>
<i>And shut yourself off, too proud</i>

1:21:28.708 --> 1:21:32.250
<i>You tried to carry the weight of my world</i>
<i>On your shoulders</i>

1:21:32.333 --> 1:21:35.250
<i>But in my life</i>
<i>You only ever played a supporting role</i>

1:21:36.708 --> 1:21:40.125
<i>Time to turn the page and close the book</i>

1:21:40.208 --> 1:21:43.916
<i>Leave your cage and try to live</i>

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:47.666
<i>Time to turn the page and close the book</i>

1:21:47.750 --> 1:21:49.708
<i>Forget your rage</i>

1:21:49.791 --> 1:21:52.458
<i>Try to live</i>

1:21:55.541 --> 1:21:59.208
<i>Turn the page, try to live</i>

1:21:59.291 --> 1:22:02.916
<i>Turn the page, try to live</i>

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:06.625
<i>Turn the page, try to live</i>

1:22:06.708 --> 1:22:11.500
