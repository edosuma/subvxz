01:41.308 --> 01:44.483
It's hardly breaking news that the
newspaper business is in deep trouble.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.752
The "Rocky Mountain News,"
which has been around

01:46.907 --> 01:50.464
for 150 years, is publishing
its last edition today.

01:50.619 --> 01:51.907
A great newspaper is dead.

01:52.059 --> 01:54.918
Denver can't support
two newspapers any longer.

01:55.066 --> 01:57.631
It's a grim race
to see who goes under first.

01:57.787 --> 02:00.351
The "Philadelphia Daily News"
and Minneapolis "Star Tribune"

02:00.507 --> 02:02.012
are both in bankruptcy.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.222
"The Boston Globe" and "San Francisco
Chronicle" have been losing...

02:04.378 --> 02:06.277
"The Seattle Post-Intelligencer,"

02:06.426 --> 02:08.958
the largest daily newspaper
yet to go out of business...

02:09.113 --> 02:10.782
Tribune Company,
owner of the "LA Times"

02:10.937 --> 02:12.891
and the "Chicago Tribune"
filed for bankruptcy...

02:13.049 --> 02:14.882
And the Gannett Company
is faltering...

02:15.033 --> 02:17.182
All the news that was fit
to print for 88 years...

02:17.337 --> 02:20.643
After 146 years, the print edition
is now a thing of the past...

02:20.793 --> 02:22.430
The "Grey Lady" is suffering from...

02:22.585 --> 02:24.833
"New York Times" stock
is off more than 75%...

02:24.984 --> 02:27.865
"The New York Times"... "The New
York Times," are you kidding me?!

02:28.024 --> 02:30.785
The obituary column
these days is full

02:30.936 --> 02:34.395
of the death notices
of American daily newspapers.

02:58.454 --> 03:00.189
So there's been a death watch
on "The New York Times"

03:00.342 --> 03:01.946
as long as I've been covering media.

03:02.102 --> 03:04.251
People are sort of fascinated
with what's going

03:04.406 --> 03:06.489
to be the demise
of this great institution.

03:06.646 --> 03:08.894
And it hasn't come,
and it hasn't come,

03:09.045 --> 03:12.024
but that doesn't lessen
people's certainty that it will come.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.813
Okay, I see this as a big story.

03:30.963 --> 03:33.691
I can probably get significant space.

03:33.843 --> 03:36.854
What do you think the story
is that I should tell?

03:37.012 --> 03:39.706
Lately when I finish an interview,

03:39.859 --> 03:41.845
most subjects have
a question of their own:

03:42.003 --> 03:44.251
What's going to happen
at "The New York Times"?

03:51.538 --> 03:53.938
Even casual followers
of the newspaper industry

03:54.098 --> 03:56.662
could rattle off
the doomsday tick-tock.

03:59.217 --> 04:00.723
Bruce Headlam.

04:00.881 --> 04:02.780
As much as we want to flatter ourselves,

04:02.930 --> 04:04.849
ifs still this very
old-school business.

04:05.009 --> 04:06.427
I'm the Media Editor.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.082
You know, trees are still cut

04:08.240 --> 04:09.746
and papers are still delivered.

04:09.904 --> 04:11.704
I just think that helps us
sort of be in the mix.

04:11.857 --> 04:13.494
- Yeah yeah.
- Okay.

04:13.648 --> 04:16.375
Not to worry,
suggest the new-media prophets.

04:16.528 --> 04:18.928
The end of "The New York Times"
wouldn't be that big of a deal,

04:19.088 --> 04:21.620
they say, because tweets,
blogs and news aggregators

04:21.776 --> 04:24.984
could create a new apparatus
of accountability.

04:25.136 --> 04:27.122
Say again?

04:28.944 --> 04:30.962
But some stories are
beyond the database.

04:31.120 --> 04:32.986
Sometimes people have
to make the calls,

04:33.135 --> 04:36.725
hit the streets and walk past
the conventional wisdom.

04:40.526 --> 04:43.058
Well, trust me,
if your numbers are better

04:43.214 --> 04:44.720
who were given the power
to rein her in,

04:44.878 --> 04:47.737
I'm just always skeptical
when everybody tells me

04:47.886 --> 04:50.767
that the numbers don't mean
what they appear to mean, you know.

04:50.926 --> 04:54.898
Because everybody gives me that line,
so I don't accept it from anybody.

04:55.053 --> 04:59.407
The collapse in advertising
happened faster

04:59.565 --> 05:01.485
than anybody anticipated.

05:01.644 --> 05:03.696
This year in 2009,

05:03.853 --> 05:06.734
there's been about a 30%
decline in advertising revenue,

05:06.893 --> 05:09.457
on top of about a 17%
decline last year,

05:09.613 --> 05:11.599
and nobody knows
where that ends.

05:11.756 --> 05:15.378
It might just be that something
very permanent has changed.

05:15.532 --> 05:19.766
Two things have happened to "The Times,"
I think in a way, most of all.

05:19.916 --> 05:22.316
The first thing that's happened,
famously, is the advertising market

05:22.475 --> 05:25.519
has turned upside down. So at the same
time as the revenue takes a hit,

05:25.675 --> 05:27.694
suddenly publishing
has gone from being

05:27.851 --> 05:30.229
something done by a specialty class

05:30.379 --> 05:32.212
to being something that literally

05:32.362 --> 05:34.610
every connected citizen
has access to.

05:34.763 --> 05:39.214
So the authoritative tone with which
"The Times" has always spoken

05:39.370 --> 05:42.611
is now one of many many
voices in a marketplace.

05:42.762 --> 05:44.945
And that reduction
in advertising revenue

05:45.097 --> 05:48.141
coupled with the competition for
attention- both at the same time-

05:48.297 --> 05:51.407
has turned this
from a transition into a revolution.

06:03.176 --> 06:06.122
So this is about WikiLeaks,
which is a website which calls itself

06:06.280 --> 06:08.080
an intelligence agency for the people.

06:08.232 --> 06:11.658
And yesterday they posted
this video of a US attack,

06:11.815 --> 06:14.096
an aerial attack, where there
were 12 people killed.

06:14.247 --> 06:16.844
The government claimed
at the time that these were insurgents,

06:16.999 --> 06:19.083
but it turns out there were
two Reuters employees

06:19.240 --> 06:20.974
and then some
other unknown people.

06:21.127 --> 06:23.113
WikiLeaks somehow
from an anonymous source

06:23.271 --> 06:25.038
gets the video
and puts it on YouTube.

06:25.191 --> 06:29.097
It felt like a possible
front-page story to Bruce and I.

06:29.254 --> 06:31.600
So now basically the assignment
for the rest of the day

06:31.750 --> 06:33.769
is to keep the story
interesting to editors.

06:33.926 --> 06:36.523
We're trying to do a front-page
story on what this means,

06:36.677 --> 06:39.372
and what this means for journalism.

06:39.526 --> 06:42.472
Clearly it's great for journalists in
some ways, because then it's out there,

06:42.630 --> 06:44.648
but it's this kind
of collision of two worlds,

06:44.806 --> 06:47.271
like this closed
old world of expertise

06:47.429 --> 06:50.441
and classification
and information and privacy

06:50.597 --> 06:52.997
and this new world that just
kind of wants to crack it all open.

06:53.156 --> 06:55.372
You know, we see it ourselves.
We're a perfect example

06:55.524 --> 06:57.673
of a kind of culture that,
you know, is having

06:57.829 --> 07:00.207
what we do completely ripped open.

07:00.356 --> 07:03.400
So it's... hey, did you send it?

07:03.555 --> 07:05.574
Okay, yeah, I got it.
Yeah, thanks. Bye.

07:05.731 --> 07:08.230
This is... these are watching
people get killed

07:08.388 --> 07:10.636
in an incredibly graphic way
in a war

07:10.787 --> 07:13.002
and hearing the reactions
of the soldiers.

07:17.443 --> 07:18.796
Roger.

07:24.515 --> 07:27.908
Roger.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.563
I didn't see that- the van flips over.

07:38.721 --> 07:40.009
I didn't notice that last time.

07:40.161 --> 07:41.766
God, what a fuckin' terrible story.

07:41.921 --> 07:43.874
"The release of the Iraq video

07:44.033 --> 07:46.051
is heaping attention
on the once-obscure website,

07:46.209 --> 07:48.391
which aims to take advantage
of the global reach of the internet

07:48.545 --> 07:50.563
and to bring to light hidden
information about governments

07:50.721 --> 07:52.226
and multinational corporations."

07:52.384 --> 07:54.217
They didn't have
to drop this off on the front step

07:54.368 --> 07:55.809
of NBC News
or "The New York Times."

07:55.968 --> 07:57.354
They just dropped it off
on YouTube

07:57.504 --> 07:58.923
and waited
for everybody else to find it.

07:59.072 --> 08:01.255
Even with "The Pentagon Papers,"

08:01.407 --> 08:04.135
they had to be delivered by hand
and they can stop the presses.

08:04.287 --> 08:05.793
This, they're just
taking it and they're just

08:05.951 --> 08:07.718
putting it up there
where everybody can see it.

08:11.871 --> 08:13.256
- Hello.
- Yes sir.

08:13.407 --> 08:15.425
Hi, Al, anything new on your front today?

08:15.583 --> 08:19.205
Very significant...
this goddamn "New York Times" exposÃ©

08:19.358 --> 08:22.152
of the most highly-classified
documents of the war.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.168
Well, God damn it,
I am not going to have it.

08:24.318 --> 08:26.598
I mean,
could "The Times" be prosecuted?

08:26.750 --> 08:29.183
Look, as far as "The Times"
is concerned, hell, they're our enemies.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.207
I think we just oughta
do it and anyway, nobody

08:31.358 --> 08:33.344
from "The New York Times"
is to be talked to.

08:33.501 --> 08:36.065
The decision
to publish "The Pentagon Papers"

08:36.221 --> 08:38.751
was the moment
when the American news media

08:38.909 --> 08:42.530
stood up and said,
"We are independent of the presidency

08:42.683 --> 08:45.892
and we are going to do what
we think is the right thing to do."

08:46.044 --> 08:48.990
Do you feel, Mr. Sulzberger,
that the national security

08:49.148 --> 08:50.948
is endangered,
as charged by the administration?

08:51.100 --> 08:52.704
I certainly do not.

08:52.860 --> 08:56.646
These papers, I think
as our editorial said this morning,

08:56.795 --> 08:59.556
were really a part of-
a part of history

08:59.707 --> 09:01.726
that should
have been made available

09:01.883 --> 09:03.967
considerably longer ago,

09:04.123 --> 09:06.109
and I just didn't feel

09:06.267 --> 09:08.548
there was any breach
of national security

09:08.698 --> 09:11.557
in the sense that we were
giving secrets to the enemy.

09:11.706 --> 09:13.954
Julian Assange,
editor for WikiLeaks,

09:14.106 --> 09:16.703
denies that the site
has put troops in danger.

09:16.858 --> 09:19.869
Assange is clearly an advocate
and opponent of the war.

09:20.026 --> 09:22.109
Assange made a name
for himself as a hacker,

09:22.266 --> 09:24.066
and was arrested
for computer crimes

09:24.217 --> 09:26.530
before starting
his whistle-blower website.

09:26.681 --> 09:29.081
We would like to see the revelations

09:29.241 --> 09:32.514
that this material gives
investigated by governments,

09:32.665 --> 09:35.065
and new policies

09:35.224 --> 09:39.010
put in place as a result,
if not prosecutions.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.113
I gotta try Julian again,

09:41.272 --> 09:43.869
because I have not heard
back from him at all.

09:44.024 --> 09:45.497
Hello?

09:45.656 --> 09:48.121
Hi, it's Brian Stelter
calling from "The Times."

09:48.280 --> 09:51.007
There is a traditional definition
of journalism that is objective,

09:51.159 --> 09:55.710
totally legal, never breaking
the law to obtain content.

09:55.863 --> 09:59.704
Do you view yourself as trying
to achieve that definition,

09:59.863 --> 10:02.624
or is your definition
of journalism broader?

10:07.703 --> 10:10.714
And tell me what the goal is.
Tell me what the goal is.

10:13.973 --> 10:16.221
I don't know whether what
he's doing is good or bad.

10:16.374 --> 10:19.549
I mean, clearly, you know,
in an open society,

10:19.701 --> 10:22.047
you know, information is,
you know, is important.

10:22.197 --> 10:24.314
It's vital for people to make decisions.

10:24.469 --> 10:27.066
On the other hand, there are things
that can get people in trouble.

10:27.221 --> 10:29.021
The video was edited in a way

10:29.173 --> 10:31.006
that did not show the full story.

10:31.156 --> 10:32.989
It was presented as journalism,

10:33.140 --> 10:35.573
but it had, you know, an agenda.

10:35.732 --> 10:38.613
Is "journalist" a word
you attach to yourself?

10:42.292 --> 10:43.481
Okay.

10:59.090 --> 11:01.273
The video has been
edited to the extent

11:01.426 --> 11:03.958
that you really have
a hard time knowing the greater context.

11:04.114 --> 11:06.395
There is, there is.

11:06.546 --> 11:08.281
- So they have both, right?
- They did do both, it's true.

11:08.433 --> 11:11.412
But the unedited version
clearly shows a guy carrying an RPG.

11:11.569 --> 11:13.817
They're shifting from being
a clearinghouse to being advocacy.

11:13.969 --> 11:15.224
It's a big decision they make

11:15.377 --> 11:17.079
to suddenly edit a 30-minute thing.

11:17.233 --> 11:19.862
- Are you writing separately on this?
- We are, we are.

11:20.017 --> 11:23.508
I certainly had not heard of
WikiLeaks before that moment.

11:23.665 --> 11:26.458
And I think probably
a lot of my colleagues hadn't either.

11:26.609 --> 11:28.987
That was the time
it kind of burst out

11:29.136 --> 11:30.675
into broader public view.

11:34.192 --> 11:37.335
- Hey hey, did you send it?
- Oh, I saw a...

11:37.487 --> 11:38.873
- there was a note in there.
- Did you?

11:39.023 --> 11:40.628
I didn't see it from you.
I'm going to open it up.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.453
He's lying.

11:42.607 --> 11:44.953
Oh, he didn't send it.
I knew he didn't send it.

11:46.255 --> 11:48.208
There's two A1 meetings.

11:48.367 --> 11:51.160
There's the 10:30 where
we discuss the stories of the day,

11:51.311 --> 11:53.264
what we're going to offer.
And there's a 4:00,

11:53.422 --> 11:55.888
when the top editors
make that decision.

11:56.046 --> 11:59.505
It's all the desk heads,
or at least somebody from each desk.

11:59.662 --> 12:01.878
You make your pitches
and they ask questions.

12:02.030 --> 12:04.911
Then they decide what they want to put
in the newspaper the next day.

12:05.069 --> 12:06.422
You know,
it's kind of a competition.

12:06.574 --> 12:08.658
You go in there and lots
of people want stories

12:08.813 --> 12:11.824
and we tight to get on A1.
But it's very constructive fighting.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.651
All right, folks,
we're still waiting for a few people

12:13.805 --> 12:17.013
but I think we can get started.
First, I think... Bruce.

12:17.165 --> 12:19.729
This is our follow on the video that was
released yesterday on the web.

12:19.884 --> 12:22.830
We're taking a look at WikiLeaks, which
is the organization that leaked it.

12:22.988 --> 12:25.007
I think it's a very
interesting moment for them.

12:25.164 --> 12:27.729
They've been gaining a lot of notoriety
because of the Baghdad video.

12:27.884 --> 12:30.743
As Ian pointed out, they've put up
the raw footage, which is 38 minutes.

12:30.891 --> 12:34.132
They've also put up an edited version,
which is what many people are seeing,

12:34.283 --> 12:37.458
and there are already people
in the army and elsewhere saying

12:37.611 --> 12:40.753
that this actually distorts
what actually happened there.

12:51.466 --> 12:55.088
And when they went to get the bodies,
they found a guy with the RPG,

12:55.241 --> 12:58.766
so as Bruce was saying,
it's become advocacy. Now-

13:03.177 --> 13:04.814
Somebody's, yeah.
I just talked with-

13:04.969 --> 13:06.290
They probably belong in the same place.

13:06.441 --> 13:07.663
- I'm sorry?
- They probably belong

13:07.817 --> 13:09.771
in one kind of
coherent whole, right?

13:09.929 --> 13:12.177
- Sure.
- Yeah, right right.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.544
In the Page-One meeting,
the most senior editors

13:14.696 --> 13:16.616
look at the summary
of the story itself

13:16.776 --> 13:18.991
and say,
"Have you framed it correctly?

13:19.144 --> 13:21.708
Does this seem loaded? Do you have
enough facts to back this up?"

13:21.863 --> 13:23.947
And then ultimately people
present their arguments

13:24.104 --> 13:25.871
pro and con and build the sides.

13:34.823 --> 13:37.103
Oh, the West Bank story.

13:38.502 --> 13:39.823
Hmmm.

13:39.975 --> 13:44.688
I don't think the whole country is
interested in Sharpe James.

13:44.838 --> 13:47.719
- No.
- Swing Sharpe and West Bank?

13:47.878 --> 13:50.988
West Bank's going to have
a big readership here.

13:51.142 --> 13:53.575
- Yeah, I wouldn't swing that.
- Swing it with WikiLeaks?

13:53.734 --> 13:55.687
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, swing it with WikiLeaks.

13:55.845 --> 13:57.799
Let's leave the West Bank story.

13:57.957 --> 14:00.968
It's going to swing, which means
in New York it will go inside,

14:01.125 --> 14:04.038
but for the rest of the country
it will go on the front page.

14:04.197 --> 14:06.991
You know, you look
for that moment where

14:07.140 --> 14:09.770
you can really tell people,
"Here's how the world's changing."

14:11.716 --> 14:13.735
When I gave
"The Pentagon Papers" to "The Times,"

14:13.892 --> 14:16.173
there was a 22-month period
from the start of my copying

14:16.324 --> 14:17.710
to it finally coming out.

14:17.860 --> 14:20.042
Had the internet existed then,

14:20.196 --> 14:22.989
I would have bought a scanner,
sent it out to all the blogs.

14:23.140 --> 14:26.020
It's not certain that
that would have had as good an effect,

14:26.179 --> 14:27.979
but at least it would have been out.

14:28.131 --> 14:31.175
The bottom line is WikiLeaks

14:31.331 --> 14:33.731
doesn't need us.

14:33.891 --> 14:35.658
Daniel Ellsberg did.

14:35.811 --> 14:38.505
The old newspaper model is dying.

14:38.658 --> 14:41.636
Period. Done. News is not dying.

14:41.794 --> 14:43.332
News is much cheaper
to produce now

14:43.490 --> 14:44.996
because we can gather
and share in new ways,

14:45.154 --> 14:47.074
operate on cheap platforms,
operate in networks.

14:47.234 --> 14:49.416
There's incredible
new ways to do news.

14:49.570 --> 14:51.490
There's no question that there is
still an enormous amount

14:51.649 --> 14:53.569
of information out there,

14:53.729 --> 14:57.253
but these papers have
the great capacity of a newsroom.

14:57.408 --> 15:00.136
And if you think of the history
of these institutions-

15:00.288 --> 15:04.358
Watergate, Abu Ghraib,
the Walter Reed scandal-

15:04.513 --> 15:06.978
it is these institutions
bringing to bear newsrooms

15:07.136 --> 15:08.674
of experienced journalists.

15:08.832 --> 15:12.258
And I think we're at a dangerous moment
in American journalism.

15:12.415 --> 15:15.721
The question really is whether
it's too late for some institutions

15:15.872 --> 15:18.817
to take advantage of that change
and change as much as they have to.

15:18.975 --> 15:21.768
So along comes David Carr,
the most human of humans,

15:21.919 --> 15:24.297
talking about how media operates

15:24.447 --> 15:26.084
within "The New York Times."

15:26.239 --> 15:28.422
Please welcome David Carr!

15:34.110 --> 15:37.918
You were a...
you are a former crack addict

15:38.077 --> 15:41.383
and you are a reporter
for "The New York Times."

15:41.534 --> 15:45.090
Which of these two do you think
is more damaging to society?

15:49.373 --> 15:51.806
If you write about
the media long enough,

15:51.965 --> 15:56.733
eventually you'll type
your way to your own doorstep.

15:59.133 --> 16:02.176
I arrived at "The New York Times" late
in my professional life,

16:02.332 --> 16:06.238
and I have an immigrant's
love of the place.

16:06.396 --> 16:08.895
The chip that was implanted
in me when I arrived...

16:09.051 --> 16:12.095
let's just call it "New York
Times" exceptionalism-

16:12.251 --> 16:15.077
leads me to conclude that
of course we will survive.

16:15.227 --> 16:17.311
You're so nice!

16:17.467 --> 16:20.740
Then again, having suffered through
drug addiction in my 20s and 30s,

16:20.891 --> 16:23.717
landing in jail
for cocaine possession,

16:23.866 --> 16:26.332
raising two children
as a single parent,

16:26.490 --> 16:28.836
and eventually ending up
at "The New York Times,"

16:28.986 --> 16:31.070
I know what it's like
to come out the other side

16:31.225 --> 16:34.204
when the odds are
stacked against you.

16:44.985 --> 16:47.003
Hi, I'm looking for Alex.

16:47.161 --> 16:49.376
Sure, you can
go have a seat on the couch.

16:49.528 --> 16:52.572
- Huh? Okay.
- He'll be right back.

16:52.728 --> 16:53.787
- Hi.
- This is David Carr

16:53.944 --> 16:55.385
- from "The New York Times."
- Nice to meet you.

16:55.544 --> 16:57.792
Don't keep saying
I'm from "The New York Times."

16:57.944 --> 16:59.777
That sucks.
I'm just- it's me.

16:59.927 --> 17:01.794
- It's nice to meet you finally.
- I'm David.

17:01.943 --> 17:04.289
- Very nice to meet you.
- Hi, pleased to meet you. How are you?

17:04.439 --> 17:08.411
We wanted to get everyone together
to do a companywide update.

17:08.567 --> 17:12.156
The media landscape is changing
in really dramatic ways

17:12.310 --> 17:16.118
in just six months.
So print as an industry

17:16.279 --> 17:18.656
and a medium continues
to nosedive.

17:18.807 --> 17:22.560
Publications like "Newsweek"
and "Times" are going down fast.

17:22.710 --> 17:25.109
We like to say that
we're perfectly positioned.

17:25.270 --> 17:27.769
Not only are
the sort of biggest media companies

17:27.925 --> 17:29.562
willing to come talk to us,
but the biggest brands

17:29.718 --> 17:31.617
are wanting to come talk to us

17:31.765 --> 17:33.598
and give us money.
And what we have to do

17:33.749 --> 17:36.248
is we have to figure out
how we can be meaner and faster

17:36.405 --> 17:38.653
and more dynamic than
everybody out there.

17:38.805 --> 17:41.566
We don't want to get hot and die.
We want to get hot and get hotter.

17:41.716 --> 17:44.728
You asked the question is there
a business model that, like...

17:44.884 --> 17:47.961
Just a sec though.
I want you to feel me on this:

17:48.117 --> 17:50.233
I don't do corporate portraiture.

17:50.388 --> 17:54.360
What the fuck is going on that
you're doing business with CNN?

17:54.516 --> 17:56.764
We know how to speak
to young people.

17:56.915 --> 17:59.512
They're listening to us.
We're a trusted brand for them.

17:59.667 --> 18:01.915
I mean, the first thing
that CNN said when they walked

18:02.067 --> 18:03.638
into the meeting
last summer was,

18:03.795 --> 18:06.556
49-year-olds are watching
CNN right now,

18:06.707 --> 18:09.435
and we're fucked.
Can you please help us develop

18:09.587 --> 18:11.933
a new, young audience
for the future?

18:12.082 --> 18:14.810
They like the way you tell stories.
They like your hosts.

18:14.962 --> 18:18.835
They like where you go." That's really
what they came looking for.

18:23.826 --> 18:26.259
So what kind of war is this, guerrilla?

18:27.441 --> 18:29.078
I don't know Liberia.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.382
I don't know what's going on.
I don't pretend to.

18:31.537 --> 18:34.264
I'm not going there for a news thing,
reporting on a particular news story.

18:34.417 --> 18:36.337
I'm not there to solve
the problems of the world.

18:36.497 --> 18:38.996
I'm just a regular guy.
I didn't get flown in on a thing.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.985
I don't have security.
I don't have anything.

18:41.136 --> 18:43.220
And I've been to some places
just fuckin' insane.

18:51.920 --> 18:54.647
If you're a CNN viewer
and you go, "Hmm,

18:54.800 --> 18:58.160
I'm looking at human shit
on the beach."

18:58.319 --> 19:00.719
I'm a regular guy

19:00.878 --> 19:02.483
and I go to these places and I go,

19:02.638 --> 19:04.984
"Okay, everyone talked to me
about cannibalism, right?"

19:05.134 --> 19:07.001
Everyone talked to me about cannibalism.
Now I'm getting

19:07.150 --> 19:09.877
a lot of shit for saying the word
"cannibalism" and stuff- whatever.

19:10.030 --> 19:11.863
Everyone talked to me
about cannibalism!

19:16.718 --> 19:18.638
- So you'd kill the child?
- Yes.

19:18.798 --> 19:20.598
- And then drink the blood?
- Yeah.

19:23.150 --> 19:26.357
That's fucking crazy.
So the actual- our audience goes,

19:26.509 --> 19:28.974
"That's fucking insane.
Like, that's nuts."

19:29.133 --> 19:31.664
And "The New York Times"
meanwhile is writing about surfing.

19:31.821 --> 19:35.312
I'm sitting there going, "You know what?
I'm not going to talk about surfing.

19:35.469 --> 19:37.552
I'm going to talk about cannibalism
because that fucks me up."

19:37.708 --> 19:39.824
Just a sec. Time out.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.878
Before you ever went there,

19:42.028 --> 19:43.828
we've had reporters there

19:43.979 --> 19:46.195
reporting on genocide
after genocide.

19:46.347 --> 19:48.780
And just because you put
on a fuckin' safari helmet

19:48.939 --> 19:51.339
and went and looked
at some poop doesn't give you

19:51.499 --> 19:52.939
the right to insult what we do.

19:53.099 --> 19:54.998
- So continue, continue.
- Sorry.

19:55.147 --> 19:57.940
I'm just saying that
I'm not a journalist.

19:58.091 --> 20:00.273
- I'm not there to report.
- Obviously. Go ahead.

20:00.427 --> 20:02.991
I'm sorry.
I'm just talking about, you know,

20:03.146 --> 20:04.587
look what I saw there.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.235
What's up?

20:12.394 --> 20:14.380
Dressed like a big Page-One guy.

20:14.537 --> 20:17.232
- How are you?
- Boy, what a day.

20:17.385 --> 20:19.949
"The Times" was
really where I wanted to work

20:20.105 --> 20:22.221
from when I was very young.

20:22.377 --> 20:26.065
I always had this idea of the place
as this sort of magisterial place

20:26.216 --> 20:28.082
where great things happened
and were done.

20:28.232 --> 20:29.934
And there was this idea
in the past where

20:30.089 --> 20:32.751
getting to "The Times"
was almost like getting tenure.

20:32.904 --> 20:35.850
And you could have
this great long 30-year, 40-year career

20:36.007 --> 20:37.578
where you go cover politics,

20:37.735 --> 20:39.754
you cover some foreign,
you maybe write a book.

20:39.911 --> 20:41.516
And that's not the track now.

20:41.671 --> 20:44.497
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are now on West 43rd Street

20:44.647 --> 20:48.269
in Midtown Manhattan in the
central office of "The New York Times."

20:48.423 --> 20:50.823
They are this minute busy getting ready.

20:50.983 --> 20:53.296
This is the beehive, the central office,

20:53.446 --> 20:55.945
the city room.
Here an avalanche of news

20:56.103 --> 20:58.416
is shaped
into Monday morning's newspaper.

20:58.566 --> 21:02.058
Well, here we are, boys.

21:02.214 --> 21:04.746
That is Tumer Catledge.
He is the managing editor.

21:04.902 --> 21:07.280
And I just heard from the circulation
department a few minutes ago

21:07.429 --> 21:09.578
that we had the largest
distribution of papers today

21:09.733 --> 21:11.370
in the history
of "The New York Times."

21:11.525 --> 21:14.732
Hard news was a phrase
"The Times" almost owned.

21:14.885 --> 21:18.474
NBC, CBS, ABC- the first thing
they'd do in the morning,

21:18.629 --> 21:21.062
the directors of their shows would
look at "The New York Times."

21:21.221 --> 21:24.298
If "The New York Times" had a story
about such and such in a faraway place,

21:24.453 --> 21:27.944
the networks would think, "Ah, now we'll
send Walter Cronkite over there."

21:28.100 --> 21:31.307
When I was growing up
I read "The Times" every morning.

21:31.460 --> 21:34.253
And then I read this book by
Gay Talese, "The Kingdom and the Power,"

21:34.404 --> 21:37.709
and it went inside
this imperial institution.

21:37.859 --> 21:39.626
And he just,
you know, thrilled me.

21:39.779 --> 21:41.994
I mean there was
nothing else I wanted to do.

21:42.147 --> 21:45.125
"'The Times' was a very human institution,

21:45.282 --> 21:48.555
run by flawed figures, men who saw
things as they could see them.

21:48.706 --> 21:52.295
But it was equally true that 'The Times'
nearly always tried to be fair.

21:52.450 --> 21:56.072
And each day, barring labor
strikes or hydrogen bombs,

21:56.226 --> 21:59.205
it would appear
in 11,464 cities around the nation

21:59.362 --> 22:01.195
and in all the capitals of the world,

22:01.345 --> 22:03.113
50 copies going
to the White House,

22:03.265 --> 22:06.408
39 copies to Moscow,
a few smuggled into Beijing,

22:06.561 --> 22:09.867
and a thick Sunday edition
to the foreign minister in Taiwan,

22:10.017 --> 22:12.811
because he required 'The Times'
as necessary proof

22:12.960 --> 22:15.011
of the Earth's existence,

22:15.169 --> 22:18.791
a barometer of its pressure,
an assessor of its sanity.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.816
If the world did indeed
still exist, he knew

22:22.976 --> 22:26.303
it would be duly recorded
each day in "The Times."

22:26.463 --> 22:29.736
There's actually something called
"The New York Times" effect.

22:29.887 --> 22:33.575
In the world of analogue newspapers,
there was an observable effect;

22:33.727 --> 22:36.072
If on day one,
"The New York Times" ran a piece

22:36.223 --> 22:38.820
on a particular story,
a political or business issue,

22:38.975 --> 22:41.026
on day two
the tier-two newspapers

22:41.183 --> 22:43.049
would all essentially
imitate the story.

22:43.198 --> 22:45.446
Just like everything else
in the newspaper business,

22:45.598 --> 22:48.063
we didn't realize that
"The New York Times" effect

22:48.222 --> 22:50.404
actually depended on

22:50.558 --> 22:52.958
the structure of analogue
newspaper distribution.

22:53.118 --> 22:56.577
"The Times" still, I think to a
remarkable degree, does set the agenda.

22:56.733 --> 22:59.745
I mean, you really can trace
almost any major story these days

22:59.901 --> 23:03.011
back to something that
originally appeared in "The Times."

23:03.165 --> 23:06.209
The problem is
is that once it reaches

23:06.364 --> 23:07.783
the public,

23:07.932 --> 23:10.464
they may not even know
it came from "The Times."

23:12.796 --> 23:15.011
Okay, so at 6:00 AM
the release goes out. Is that right?

23:15.164 --> 23:17.063
So for two, three months now-

23:17.212 --> 23:19.166
I think the end of September
the story leaked

23:19.324 --> 23:20.764
that Comcast was going to buy NBC.

23:20.923 --> 23:23.139
It seems like finally
it will be announced.

23:23.291 --> 23:25.823
So the challenge is this piece
I'm working on with Sorkin,

23:25.979 --> 23:27.746
which is what we call
a tick-tock, which is

23:27.899 --> 23:31.936
the fun details behind the scenes
of how the deal came together.

23:32.091 --> 23:34.884
So I'm just waiting for Andrew
to come up so we can sort that out,

23:35.035 --> 23:37.217
and we'll get that
in the paper tomorrow.

23:37.371 --> 23:39.040
By the way,
how's the tick-tock coming?

23:39.195 --> 23:41.278
Sorkin, I'm just waiting
for him. He's like...

23:41.434 --> 23:42.722
- Has he filed anything?
- No.

23:42.874 --> 23:44.544
So that means
he hasn't written a word.

23:44.698 --> 23:46.051
I don't know.
Like at 11:00, he said,

23:46.202 --> 23:47.904
"I'll have something
for you in an hour."

23:48.057 --> 23:49.857
So now I'm going to look
like a chump if I don't hit that.

23:50.010 --> 23:51.363
Because our deal was
he was going to write what he had

23:51.514 --> 23:54.492
and I was going to write into it.

23:54.649 --> 23:56.733
Do you want me to go to him
and say Bruce needs to talk?

23:56.889 --> 23:59.900
- Just say Bruce needs it in 15 minutes.
- Okay.

24:00.057 --> 24:02.457
It's another reshaping
of the media industry.

24:02.616 --> 24:04.766
Comcast, which is
the biggest cable company,

24:04.920 --> 24:07.168
they look at the future
and they see what's going on in media,

24:07.320 --> 24:09.819
and they worry about if young
people are watching TV online,

24:09.976 --> 24:12.856
are they going to need to keep paying
their cable bills forever down the road?

24:13.016 --> 24:15.580
So they feel like, if they can own
as much of the television shows

24:15.735 --> 24:17.273
and the movies,
they can play a bigger part

24:17.432 --> 24:19.483
in that future,
whatever that future is.

24:24.151 --> 24:25.504
I want to talk to you.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.160
Can I wait?

24:27.319 --> 24:30.494
You'll come up?
He's going to come up.

24:33.047 --> 24:35.327
All right, here's the lede.
"The secret meeting"...

24:35.478 --> 24:38.392
secret...
"The secret meeting was set for

24:38.550 --> 24:40.863
1:00 PM the second week of July

24:41.014 --> 24:43.414
in an out-of-the-way condominium
along the ninth hole

24:43.573 --> 24:45.275
of the golf course
in Sun Valley, Idaho.

24:45.430 --> 24:47.448
Jeffrey Immelt got
to the condo first,

24:47.606 --> 24:50.716
trying desperately to avoid
being spotted by Jeff Zucker,

24:50.869 --> 24:52.953
the chief executive NBC Universal

24:53.109 --> 24:55.771
who was mingling with other executives
in front of the duck pond

24:55.925 --> 24:58.805
only a couple hundred yards away
and had no idea what was happening."

24:58.965 --> 25:02.871
Okay, anyway, here's the story.
I'm calling GE now.

25:03.028 --> 25:05.046
- Okay.
- So I'm hoping you can like...

25:05.204 --> 25:07.255
- Sort of maybe tie it together.
- ...tie it together.

25:07.411 --> 25:09.976
Because it's basically
just all these little weird stories.

25:10.132 --> 25:12.216
And I tried to tie it
and leave little places to...

25:12.371 --> 25:14.138
- Then how would...
- It works out for Comcast

25:14.291 --> 25:16.637
if the thing becomes worth
a lot of money in the future.

25:16.787 --> 25:18.936
- Okay.
- That's basically the concept.

25:19.091 --> 25:21.884
All right. How many words do you
think we have for this? It's very long.

25:22.035 --> 25:24.053
- You think you can do it in 1500?
- Yeah.

25:26.451 --> 25:27.989
- Is it looking good? Are you happy?
- Yeah.

25:28.146 --> 25:30.524
I mean some of this may just
be too much detail, by the way.

25:30.674 --> 25:33.849
- I went a little overboard.
- Yeah no, I'm tightening it up.

25:34.002 --> 25:36.948
- He said we have 1500 words.
- This thing's like 1500 words now.

25:37.106 --> 25:38.644
No no, he said
we could have 1500.

25:38.801 --> 25:40.471
I'll check and tell you
if it's different.

25:40.625 --> 25:42.295
I've gotta make sure
we got the space.

25:42.449 --> 25:44.795
- Sorkin have a look?
- Sorkin just emailed me

25:44.945 --> 25:47.804
and said file away,
but said don't put it on the web yet,

25:47.953 --> 25:50.811
because he still needs
to confirm something.

25:50.961 --> 25:53.339
Once we could
pare it down and tighten it up,

25:53.488 --> 25:55.255
I think it read well.
It tried to tell a tale

25:55.408 --> 25:56.793
rather than get bogged down

25:56.944 --> 25:59.093
in the financials
and the numbers.

26:11.407 --> 26:14.713
Here was this kid, 21-year-old
Brian Stelter, who started a blog,

26:14.862 --> 26:16.728
who did it anonymously
so no one would out him,

26:16.879 --> 26:18.778
until "The New York Times"
outed him as a mere kid.

26:18.926 --> 26:20.367
He made his brand
and his reputation

26:20.526 --> 26:22.064
by just getting out there
and blogging.

26:22.222 --> 26:24.055
You know,
he became this sort of must-read

26:24.206 --> 26:26.038
for the Brian Williamses
of the world.

26:26.190 --> 26:28.372
And I think "The Times" had the idea,
"Why don't we hire this guy?"

26:28.526 --> 26:30.392
A week
after that story was published,

26:30.541 --> 26:32.560
"The Times" contacted me
and asked me to come up

26:32.717 --> 26:34.136
and do these series of interviews

26:34.285 --> 26:35.758
back to back to back with editors,

26:35.917 --> 26:37.816
seeing if you're
"Times" material, I guess.

26:37.965 --> 26:40.278
You see him
at his desk and he's got

26:40.428 --> 26:42.993
two laptops and TVs open
and he's Twittering,

26:43.149 --> 26:46.160
and he just embodies
everything about new media.

26:46.317 --> 26:48.913
I don't know why anybody
who's a reporter isn't on Twitter.

26:49.068 --> 26:51.413
I constantly berate
my colleagues who aren't on it.

26:51.564 --> 26:55.285
It drives me nuts when I'll hear
my colleagues talking about a story

26:55.435 --> 26:57.683
at noon, and I read it
on Twitter at midnight.

26:57.836 --> 26:59.887
I'm thinking to myself,
"Why is that allowed?"

27:00.043 --> 27:03.251
You know, "Why are we not
on top of the news?" It's 2010.

27:03.403 --> 27:05.389
I still can't get over the feeling

27:05.547 --> 27:07.249
that Brian Stelter was a robot

27:07.402 --> 27:09.715
assembled in the basement
of "The New York Times"

27:09.867 --> 27:12.300
to come and destroy me.

27:14.186 --> 27:15.757
Here's an entertaining tip:

27:15.914 --> 27:18.031
I'm putting
the expensive beer on the top.

27:20.938 --> 27:24.146
Welcome to Austin,
the city where for the time being

27:24.297 --> 27:27.473
everybody is famous,
the economy is rocking

27:27.625 --> 27:29.262
and the grid is groaning

27:29.417 --> 27:32.211
under an influx
of the digitally interested.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.877
- I might have to put you on ban.
- No, I agree, I agree.

27:37.033 --> 27:39.116
I might have to put you on ban.

27:42.216 --> 27:45.740
You're both going to end up
with your devices over the fence.

27:47.912 --> 27:50.607
Twitter entered
the lexicon two years ago here,

27:50.759 --> 27:53.389
when it was the darling
of the conference.

27:53.543 --> 27:55.311
Why talk when you can tweet?

27:55.463 --> 27:57.263
You're reading an article.
If you want to tweet about it

27:57.416 --> 27:59.335
or if you want to follow the columnist,
you can do it right there.

27:59.495 --> 28:01.808
Headlines can be sent
out via Twitter.

28:01.959 --> 28:04.905
It's about finding out what's happening
in the world that you care about.

28:05.062 --> 28:08.554
Really, what could
anyone possibly find useful

28:08.710 --> 28:11.721
in this cacophony
of short-burst communication?

28:11.878 --> 28:15.948
But at 52, I succumbed,
partly out of professional necessity.

28:17.477 --> 28:19.660
Now nearly a year later, has Twitter

28:19.813 --> 28:22.639
turned my brain to mush? No.

28:22.789 --> 28:24.142
It's hard to convince someone
that they should use Twitter

28:24.294 --> 28:26.213
until you get them on it
and they use if for 10 days

28:26.373 --> 28:29.253
and they're like,
"Oh, this is why it's interesting."

28:29.413 --> 28:30.983
I'm a narrative
on more things at a given moment

28:31.141 --> 28:32.362
than I ever thought possible.

28:32.517 --> 28:33.902
See how many people just now...

28:34.052 --> 28:35.241
I get a sense of today's news

28:35.396 --> 28:37.263
and how people are reacting to it

28:37.412 --> 28:39.790
in the time it takes to wait
for a coffee at Starbucks.

28:41.028 --> 28:43.406
Nearly a year in,
I've come to understand

28:43.555 --> 28:45.672
that the real value of the service is

28:45.827 --> 28:48.871
listening to a wired collective voice.

28:49.027 --> 28:51.111
The medium's not the message.

28:51.267 --> 28:53.864
The messages are the media.

29:02.050 --> 29:04.134
- Bruce?
- We're always looking for ways

29:04.290 --> 29:08.044
to show how cutbacks across the media
business has affected coverage.

29:08.194 --> 29:10.824
And Brian Stelter has
come up with an unlikely one,

29:10.978 --> 29:12.713
which is coverage
of the President of the United States.

29:12.865 --> 29:14.600
When Obama travels
to Buffalo today,

29:14.754 --> 29:16.740
there won't be
a charter plane traveling with him

29:16.897 --> 29:19.079
because many of the networks
have simply opted out

29:19.233 --> 29:20.771
of taking that very expensive ride,

29:20.929 --> 29:22.762
and the reason is simply cost.

29:22.912 --> 29:26.305
Uh, we'll call it "press"

29:26.465 --> 29:29.029
Oh good, my sources are
starting to come out.

29:29.184 --> 29:31.562
They're starting to wake up.

29:31.712 --> 29:35.138
It's job number one, of course,
for every DC bureau to follow

29:35.296 --> 29:38.471
the president and to travel with him
on trips both foreign and domestic.

29:38.623 --> 29:41.384
But lately there's been fewer and fewer
of these White House planes

29:41.536 --> 29:43.881
that go with President Obama to events.

29:44.031 --> 29:45.569
These guys are trying every day

29:45.727 --> 29:47.779
to save every dollar they can.

29:47.935 --> 29:50.816
It's a demonstration of networks
trying to do more with less.

29:50.975 --> 29:52.710
Or just accepting
you can only do less.

29:52.863 --> 29:55.973
Sometimes that's the answer-
is just doing less.

29:56.126 --> 29:59.912
Is it 1,500 people
on staff right now? 1400.

30:00.062 --> 30:03.651
Are you confirming that 300
and 400 number that's out there?

30:03.806 --> 30:07.712
ABC's laying off 400 people.
CBS laid off 90 a few weeks ago.

30:07.869 --> 30:10.182
God, that is stunning.

30:10.334 --> 30:13.858
20 to 25% of the staff
they're trying to cut.

30:15.389 --> 30:16.862
They're not just there to make sure

30:17.020 --> 30:18.690
the president doesn't
choke on a chicken bone.

30:18.844 --> 30:20.928
They're also there to corner
people for interviews

30:21.085 --> 30:22.438
in a way they couldn't otherwise.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.771
I think the other thing
you have to do is nod

30:24.924 --> 30:27.325
to what this is going
to mean for coverage

30:27.484 --> 30:29.219
in the next few campaigns.
In the last election,

30:29.372 --> 30:31.718
because they couldn't afford
to send out regular reporters,

30:31.867 --> 30:33.886
they were sending out
24-year-olds with video cameras.

30:34.043 --> 30:35.745
They were capturing
all kinds of things.

30:35.900 --> 30:38.497
Somebody fell asleep and it never would
have been caught if they didn't have

30:38.651 --> 30:41.891
some kid with a video camera
who was bored and filming everything.

30:42.043 --> 30:43.712
He's not going
to make news today, no.

30:43.867 --> 30:46.049
No, the last president
who made news in Buffalo got shot.

30:46.203 --> 30:48.549
Wasn't it McKinley?

30:48.698 --> 30:51.579
Let's not put that one in the paper.

30:51.738 --> 30:53.244
This is what it is at this point:

30:53.402 --> 30:55.748
How do you cover
the president on the cheap?

30:57.530 --> 31:00.356
We've looked at

31:00.506 --> 31:03.005
every, I think, conceivable model

31:03.161 --> 31:06.107
all the way from,
you know, philanthropic,

31:06.265 --> 31:09.888
you know, could you find
a generous foundation

31:10.041 --> 31:12.419
that wants to underwrite
"The New York Times"

31:12.569 --> 31:14.304
to memberships.

31:14.457 --> 31:17.087
That's an extraordinary thing.
I mean, it used to be

31:17.240 --> 31:19.869
that newspapers almost
gave themselves away.

31:20.024 --> 31:23.264
I mean, they charged far less than
the cost of printing the newspaper,

31:23.416 --> 31:25.369
and they made up
the difference in advertising.

31:25.527 --> 31:27.775
The newspaper industry
didn't see Monster.com

31:27.928 --> 31:30.110
taking the jobs portion away.
They didn't see

31:30.264 --> 31:32.250
Craigslist taking
the classifieds portion away.

31:32.407 --> 31:34.906
They didn't see Ford and GM
making their own websites

31:35.063 --> 31:37.628
to take automotive advertising
basically away forever.

31:37.783 --> 31:43.129
We are now in
the middle of a really unsettling time.

31:43.287 --> 31:45.185
The real question is whether
newspaper advertising

31:45.334 --> 31:47.003
will ever return at the same level.

31:47.158 --> 31:49.471
Like a lot of companies in the industry,

31:49.621 --> 31:52.502
this one found itself scrambling
for its cash position.

31:52.661 --> 31:55.258
The company borrowed
$250 million from Carlos Slim

31:55.414 --> 31:57.792
and executed
a sale-leaseback of the building,

31:57.942 --> 32:00.222
which is essentially like
mortgaging the building.

32:00.373 --> 32:02.327
Nobody wanted to make
any predictions,

32:02.485 --> 32:05.049
because all the predictions they had
been making had been so badly wrong.

32:05.205 --> 32:06.940
Nobody was pessimistic enough.

32:07.093 --> 32:10.781
There was just this sort of

32:10.933 --> 32:14.140
decades of organizational hubris

32:14.292 --> 32:16.278
about, you know,

32:16.436 --> 32:18.585
our own excellence

32:18.740 --> 32:21.085
and our own dominance.

32:21.236 --> 32:25.523
And then in a matter
of, like, 18 months,

32:25.684 --> 32:29.240
all of a sudden there was-
the air ionized the situat-

32:29.395 --> 32:32.024
and everybody started
like asking a question:

32:32.179 --> 32:36.183
Could "The New York Times,"
like, go out of business?

32:36.339 --> 32:38.739
"The New York Times,"
which is trading for three bucks-

32:38.898 --> 32:41.495
a Sunday newspaper costs more than
a share of "New York Times" stock.

32:41.650 --> 32:45.011
There has been, since the famous
"Atlantic," you know, "Monthly" story,

32:45.170 --> 32:48.116
there has been open talk of
"What if 'The Times' were to go away?"

32:48.274 --> 32:52.027
You know, I don't pretend
to be a seasoned business reporter,

32:52.177 --> 32:54.196
but certainly looking
at the numbers, it did seem

32:54.353 --> 32:57.299
as if they were in some peril and that
there certainly was a scenario

32:57.457 --> 32:59.803
in which if they didn't act fast,

32:59.952 --> 33:02.036
that "The Times" could
go into bankruptcy.

33:02.192 --> 33:03.698
And so that's what I wrote.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.421
I thought, "You horse's ass."
I thought, you know,

33:06.576 --> 33:08.759
"You don't know what you're
talking about. You really don't."

33:08.912 --> 33:10.811
I mean, I thought that
that kind of article,

33:10.960 --> 33:12.663
for that to appear in "The Atlantic,"

33:12.816 --> 33:15.064
I thought that was just
so stupid of "The Atlantic."

33:15.215 --> 33:18.259
I was actually pretty stunned
at the reaction that piece had.

33:18.415 --> 33:21.176
I just- I didn't...
I genuinely didn't expect

33:21.327 --> 33:23.607
that people would be
so shocked by it,

33:23.759 --> 33:25.712
because it felt sort
of obvious to me.

33:25.870 --> 33:29.143
Please. I mean this is "The New York
Times" we're talking about,

33:29.295 --> 33:33.233
and I think that that kind of an article
was both- I found it just dumb.

33:33.391 --> 33:35.922
There's a collective denial about

33:36.078 --> 33:39.220
what is going on and that
newspapers are somehow special

33:39.374 --> 33:41.719
and somehow they're public trusts

33:41.870 --> 33:44.848
and that they shouldn't fail,

33:45.006 --> 33:47.286
and so therefore they won't fail.

33:47.438 --> 33:50.481
And I think the disconnect between
"shouldn't fail" and "can't fail"

33:50.637 --> 33:53.201
is the thing that I'm trying
to, like, really blow up.

34:07.788 --> 34:09.971
"End Times" is good. It's great.

34:10.123 --> 34:12.851
People have been arguing
that "The New York Times"

34:13.004 --> 34:15.885
should be put out of business
ever since there was one.

34:16.043 --> 34:17.712
So it's an old question,

34:17.867 --> 34:20.878
but one that has a great deal
of salience for people.

34:21.034 --> 34:22.835
They like it.

34:22.987 --> 34:25.714
I don't think it's an argument
that will be very easily made,

34:25.866 --> 34:28.529
and if it is, I'll vaporize
whoever's making it.

34:28.681 --> 34:30.995
I'd like to note
that none of us are economists.

34:31.146 --> 34:32.750
We're here not to talk
about whether

34:32.906 --> 34:34.958
"The Times" is
a viable institution or not,

34:35.114 --> 34:38.092
talk about CPMs
or prices on advertising.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.431
We're here to talk about
what would happen

34:40.585 --> 34:42.603
if "The New York Times"
disappeared.

34:42.762 --> 34:45.871
How many of you would be happy
if "The Times" disappeared?

34:46.025 --> 34:47.924
Okay, so we have
a sprinkling of hands.

34:48.072 --> 34:49.971
We have probably
10 people voted for that.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.914
And then how many of you
would be disappointed or upset?

34:53.065 --> 34:55.694
Okay, wow. So-

34:55.848 --> 34:58.990
Markos,
I'm going to go to you first.

34:59.144 --> 35:02.449
If "The Times" ceased to exist,
how would you feel about it?

35:02.600 --> 35:05.065
I think there's a perception

35:05.224 --> 35:07.918
that a lot of people like me
who are writing online

35:08.072 --> 35:11.050
cheer the demise of traditional media
outlets like "The New York Times."

35:11.207 --> 35:13.389
But people like me just want
traditional media outlets

35:13.543 --> 35:15.441
like "The New York Times"
to do theirjobs,

35:15.591 --> 35:17.162
to do what they're supposed to do.

35:17.319 --> 35:19.435
"The New York Times"
helped cheerlead

35:19.591 --> 35:21.806
our way into the war in Iraq
with Judith Miller.

35:21.959 --> 35:24.719
I think a lot of the decline
in these traditional media outlets

35:24.870 --> 35:27.467
is because people have
lost faith that those publications

35:27.622 --> 35:29.935
don't have ulterior
motives or agendas.

35:30.086 --> 35:33.359
People like me, I have an agenda,
and I'm very clear about it.

35:33.509 --> 35:36.815
But "The New York Times," they try
to be something better than that...

35:36.965 --> 35:39.530
That's great, Markos,
but here's the thing:

35:39.685 --> 35:41.322
When you're making
an argument about how

35:41.476 --> 35:43.430
we're always falling down on the job,

35:43.589 --> 35:46.568
you're reaching back through five years

35:46.724 --> 35:49.637
of really important,
good hard reporting.

35:49.796 --> 35:52.808
We're on the ground in Afghanistan.
We're on the ground in Iraq.

35:52.964 --> 35:54.884
I'm not implying that it's bad work.

35:55.044 --> 35:57.543
I'm saying that to claim that because
you're with "The New York Times"

35:57.699 --> 35:59.718
you have to be taken seriously,
I think that's dangerous.

35:59.875 --> 36:02.953
It's that sort of implied credibility
that "The New York Times" brings,

36:03.107 --> 36:05.671
and that's how Judith Miller
got away with her war...

36:05.827 --> 36:08.424
pre-war coverage that helped
get us into this war.

36:08.579 --> 36:11.884
It's because she works for "The New York
Times," so she has to be credible.

36:12.035 --> 36:14.119
Judy Miller reported, quote...

36:16.227 --> 36:18.442
"The New York Times"
carried the unsubstantiated

36:18.594 --> 36:20.646
claims of those, including...

36:20.802 --> 36:23.050
On the front page
of the nation's paper of record,

36:23.201 --> 36:25.514
"The Times" reported that
Saddam Hussein had launched a...

36:28.321 --> 36:30.634
Weapons of mass destruction.
Weapons of mass destruction.

36:30.785 --> 36:33.065
"The Times" had reporters

36:33.217 --> 36:35.203
who were very much vulnerable.

36:35.361 --> 36:37.958
There's a story in
"The New York Times" this morning...

36:38.112 --> 36:40.742
We read in "The New York Times"
today a story that says

36:40.896 --> 36:43.079
that Saddam Hussein
is closer...

36:43.232 --> 36:46.310
They were trying to acquire
certain high quality...

36:46.464 --> 36:48.384
The Bush administration was helped

36:48.544 --> 36:50.497
by the nation's leading newspaper,
"The New York Times."

36:50.656 --> 36:52.423
If "The New York Times"
thinks Saddam

36:52.575 --> 36:53.797
is on the precipice
of mushroom clouds,

36:53.952 --> 36:56.068
then there is really no debate.

36:56.223 --> 36:59.202
Judy Miller was
someone who was let loose on this story,

36:59.359 --> 37:01.508
and there were not people there

37:01.663 --> 37:04.543
who were given the power
to rein her in,

37:04.703 --> 37:06.754
and she clearly
needed to be reined in.

37:06.910 --> 37:09.671
Do you accept
that your reporting was wrong?

37:09.823 --> 37:13.445
Absolutely.
The handful of stories-

37:13.598 --> 37:15.398
about six or seven of them-

37:15.550 --> 37:18.877
that I did before the war

37:19.037 --> 37:20.510
Wefe Wl'ollg,

37:20.669 --> 37:22.437
and the intelligence information

37:22.589 --> 37:25.600
that I was accurately
reporting was wrong.

37:25.757 --> 37:28.834
I guess if your sources are wrong,

37:28.989 --> 37:30.593
you're going to be wrong.

37:30.749 --> 37:33.695
But to say you got it wrong
when your sources were wrong,

37:33.852 --> 37:37.213
that, as your colleagues
at "The New York Times" have said,

37:37.372 --> 37:40.580
reduces your role as a journalist
to no more than a stenographer.

37:40.732 --> 37:44.224
No, on the contrary,
I really reject that criticism.

37:44.380 --> 37:46.496
We made errors in our coverage

37:46.652 --> 37:48.551
of the weapons of mass destruction.

37:48.699 --> 37:51.198
We made them at the reporting
level and at the editing level.

37:51.356 --> 37:53.756
Does she tell the truth?

37:53.915 --> 37:55.999
"The New York Times"
can't have a reporter-

37:56.155 --> 37:57.988
And we don't.

38:01.850 --> 38:05.123
Anytime "The Times" fails
on a serious scale

38:05.274 --> 38:07.107
on a particular story, a big story,

38:07.258 --> 38:09.441
there's a cost.

38:09.594 --> 38:11.362
There's a price to pay.

38:11.514 --> 38:14.657
And certainly in recent years,
you've heard people say,

38:14.809 --> 38:17.919
"Well, I no longer need 'The Times.'
I can no longer trust 'The Times."'

38:18.073 --> 38:20.386
One more Jayson Blair
or one more Judy Miller

38:20.537 --> 38:22.588
and you're chipping away
at this institution

38:22.745 --> 38:24.861
that everyone is sort
of desperate to protect.

38:25.016 --> 38:27.417
I think kind of until Jayson Blair,

38:27.577 --> 38:29.628
they were kind of impervious.
They were Teflon.

38:29.784 --> 38:32.992
The Jayson Blair incident was
a real scandalous occasion.

38:33.145 --> 38:35.064
The reporter was found
to be reporting stories

38:35.224 --> 38:37.373
at places where he was
not actually there,

38:37.528 --> 38:40.092
though the dateline would give
indication that he was there,

38:40.248 --> 38:42.234
taking stories and not even
rewriting them-

38:42.391 --> 38:44.377
written by other people
at other newspapers.

38:44.535 --> 38:46.172
He eventually got caught

38:46.328 --> 38:48.706
because he plagiarized
a story from someone

38:48.855 --> 38:51.420
who had previously been
a colleague of his at "The Times."

38:51.575 --> 38:55.361
Not only does he take
and wind a rope around his neck

38:55.511 --> 38:57.627
and, like, go jumping off
a cliff, you know,

38:57.782 --> 38:59.834
right in plain sight,

38:59.990 --> 39:02.903
but he ties it to our feet and tries
to pull us off the cliff with him.

39:03.062 --> 39:05.626
The minute they put it
on the front page in that little box-

39:05.782 --> 39:08.663
I still remember the day it came out-
Raines's reign was over.

39:08.821 --> 39:10.425
This system is not set up

39:10.582 --> 39:13.113
to catch someone
who sets out to lie

39:13.269 --> 39:15.898
and to use every means
at his or her disposal

39:16.053 --> 39:18.584
to put false information
into the paper.

39:18.741 --> 39:20.639
You went from having Howell

39:20.788 --> 39:22.742
being the most successful editor,

39:22.901 --> 39:24.635
not just in the history
of "The Times,"

39:24.788 --> 39:27.287
in the history of newspapering,
to his being fired.

39:27.444 --> 39:29.943
I'm delighted to announce Bill Keller

39:30.100 --> 39:32.151
as our next executive editor.

39:34.131 --> 39:37.110
I'm aiming to raise our ambitions
higher than they've ever been.

39:37.267 --> 39:40.573
When Bill came in,
he was all about

39:40.723 --> 39:43.833
restoring trust
after Howell Raines.

39:43.987 --> 39:47.543
He was supposed to sort of get
the ship back on course.

39:47.699 --> 39:50.164
It just wasn't
in the conversation that,

39:50.322 --> 39:53.650
you know, there was going
to be an economic crisis in journalism.

39:53.810 --> 39:56.091
And that's been
the dominant event,

39:56.242 --> 39:58.708
I think if you
asked him, on his watch.

39:58.866 --> 40:00.732
Darker times
are ahead for the "Grey Lady."

40:00.882 --> 40:02.584
"The Times" will resort to layoffs.

40:02.737 --> 40:04.407
The paper is looking to cut
100 jobs from its news staff

40:04.561 --> 40:05.849
by the end of the week.

40:14.737 --> 40:18.163
We're hearing that the layoffs
are beginning today.

40:19.697 --> 40:22.326
We now know how many people

40:22.480 --> 40:24.858
have opted to go voluntarily,

40:25.007 --> 40:27.888
which means we know how many
people we have to layoff.

40:28.047 --> 40:30.775
In the immediate moment,
we're in the middle of cutting

40:30.927 --> 40:33.971
100 people out of a staff
of roughly 1250.

40:34.127 --> 40:37.487
We've spent a lot of time
in the last couple of weeks

40:37.647 --> 40:40.178
going over lists,
trying to prioritize

40:40.335 --> 40:43.062
based on skills
we can afford to lose.

40:43.214 --> 40:46.160
We are not a specialized newspaper,
we're a general-interest newspaper.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.534
And we try to be excellent
at everything from foreign coverage

40:48.686 --> 40:51.600
to education coverage
to arts to sports.

40:51.758 --> 40:55.063
You know, we're large, but there's
not a lot of slack in the system.

40:55.214 --> 40:57.200
I feel some days that,
you know,

40:57.357 --> 41:00.151
we should be
symbolically wearing, you know,

41:00.301 --> 41:03.345
bloody butchers' smocks
or something around the newsroom.

41:03.501 --> 41:06.479
It's such a kind of

41:06.636 --> 41:09.495
grim undertaking.

41:11.277 --> 41:13.841
I was hired in 1977.

41:13.996 --> 41:16.212
When I was trying
to get this job,

41:16.364 --> 41:18.263
a job-getting focus group

41:18.412 --> 41:21.008
asked me to write my own obituary.

41:21.164 --> 41:24.524
And since then, I've been
the deputy editor of obituaries.

41:26.315 --> 41:29.294
Hey, it's Claiborne Ray,
the departing retiring person.

41:29.451 --> 41:31.732
Should I come down through
the freight elevator

41:31.883 --> 41:33.934
or through the regular
passenger elevator?

41:34.091 --> 41:36.688
I came with the high hopes

41:36.843 --> 41:39.221
of staying for one year.

41:39.371 --> 41:42.382
I've overstayed that by 20 years.

41:44.810 --> 41:47.342
We have to
dump bodies overboard.

41:47.498 --> 41:49.997
They don't really have any choice.

41:50.153 --> 41:52.237
We all got the packets in the mail.

41:52.394 --> 41:54.794
There's something obviously dispiriting

41:54.953 --> 41:56.623
about getting a packet in the mail

41:56.777 --> 41:58.643
that invites you to leave your job.

41:58.793 --> 42:02.219
I almost feel like I don't know
of everything that's going on

42:02.376 --> 42:04.809
and I almost feel like
I don't have a clear grasp

42:04.969 --> 42:07.118
on the enormity of the situation.

42:07.272 --> 42:09.771
I decided not to press my luck.

42:09.928 --> 42:13.256
Nobody knows if there'll be a paper
on paper in another five years.

42:13.416 --> 42:16.559
Everybody is
unbelievably pressured to do

42:16.711 --> 42:19.111
more than people
are really humanly able to do.

42:19.272 --> 42:21.966
I'm sorry to leave "The Times."

42:23.687 --> 42:25.640
There are a lot of unemployed
people out there,

42:25.799 --> 42:28.298
a lot of underemployed people
and a lot of scared people.

42:28.455 --> 42:31.532
And I have to remind myself every day
that I'm one of the lucky ones.

42:31.686 --> 42:33.738
The main effect is just this insecurity

42:33.894 --> 42:36.240
that pervades
the newspaper business.

42:36.390 --> 42:38.954
The mood is so funereal.

42:42.086 --> 42:44.039
For those of us who work in media,

42:44.197 --> 42:46.151
life is a drumbeat
of goodbye speeches

42:46.310 --> 42:49.583
with sheet cakes
and cheap sparkling wine.

42:49.733 --> 42:53.639
That carnage has left behind
an island of misfit toys,

42:53.796 --> 42:57.670
like model trains whose
cabooses have square wheels.

42:59.556 --> 43:01.739
Sure, I've been fired
in my day, but always after

43:01.892 --> 43:04.522
I'd failed to show up at work
like a normal person.

43:04.676 --> 43:08.004
"Go to treatment," my editor at the
magazine in Minneapolis would tell me.

43:08.164 --> 43:10.379
"There's a bed waiting for you."

43:10.531 --> 43:12.364
But at the tender age of 31,

43:12.516 --> 43:14.916
I still had a year left
before hitting rock bottom,

43:15.075 --> 43:18.534
a year left of being that guy,
the violent drug-snorting thug,

43:18.691 --> 43:20.840
before I found
my way to this guy,

43:20.995 --> 43:23.559
the one with a family and a job
at "The New York Times."

43:23.714 --> 43:27.403
One day I came over from
"The Twin Cities Reader" where I worked,

43:27.554 --> 43:32.322
came over here to the Skyway Lounge
and met my friend Phil.

43:32.482 --> 43:34.915
Phil gave me
a film canister full of coke,

43:35.073 --> 43:38.401
and I was going to get a gram.
I went into the bathroom,

43:38.561 --> 43:41.475
the cop hit
the stall door that I was in

43:41.634 --> 43:44.612
and said,
"You roll a noisy joint, pal."

43:44.769 --> 43:47.812
And he immediately
put me up against the wall

43:47.969 --> 43:51.012
and then walked me down
the street this way

43:51.169 --> 43:54.890
and up the block toward Nicollet Mall
where his car was parked.

43:55.040 --> 43:59.077
The interesting thing about that is that
my father worked right in City Center,

43:59.232 --> 44:01.447
so I was being crabwalked

44:01.599 --> 44:04.872
in handcuffs past the shopping-

44:05.024 --> 44:07.817
the downtown shopping center
where my father worked.

44:07.967 --> 44:10.367
It was another life.

44:10.527 --> 44:12.808
It was another guy.

44:12.959 --> 44:15.425
It's that guy.

44:23.678 --> 44:26.242
Not very.

44:28.925 --> 44:32.864
Look, I'm afraid of guns

44:33.021 --> 44:35.847
and I'm afraid of bats.

44:35.998 --> 44:38.692
I'm really not afraid of anything else.

44:38.845 --> 44:41.507
It's an advantage of having
lived a textured life.

44:41.660 --> 44:45.730
I've been a single parent on welfare.
This is nothing.

44:45.885 --> 44:48.678
I was talking to John Hume
and he said, "Look,

44:48.829 --> 44:50.531
you didn't go to Afghanistan.

44:50.684 --> 44:53.085
You didn't tum
into the great city-hall columnist.

44:53.244 --> 44:57.314
You didn't set out to be
a media reporter, but you are.

44:57.468 --> 45:00.447
And your story has arrived

45:00.603 --> 45:03.102
and it behooves you

45:03.259 --> 45:05.725
to man up, show some sack

45:05.883 --> 45:09.156
and cover it until it's done."

45:09.307 --> 45:12.133
And I thought, "You know what?
That's what I'm going to do."

45:12.282 --> 45:16.603
Welcome, everyone, to another debate
from "Intelligence Squared."

45:16.763 --> 45:18.530
We'll be debating this motion:

45:18.682 --> 45:21.661
Good riddance
to the mainstream media.

45:21.818 --> 45:24.197
There will be winners
and losers tonight,

45:24.346 --> 45:26.627
and you the audience
will be our judges.

45:26.777 --> 45:28.348
I work at
"The New York Times."

45:28.505 --> 45:31.102
We have 17 million people
that come to our website.

45:31.257 --> 45:34.563
We put out 100 videos every month.
We have 80 blogs.

45:34.713 --> 45:37.091
We are fully engaged
in the revolution.

45:37.240 --> 45:40.121
"The New York Times" has dozens
of bureaus all over the world,

45:40.280 --> 45:43.106
and we're going to toss that out-
which is the proposition...

45:43.256 --> 45:46.137
toss that out and kick back

45:46.296 --> 45:48.129
and see what Facebook tums up.

45:50.296 --> 45:51.736
I don't think so.

45:51.895 --> 45:54.874
What you're going to hear
tonight is that the media

45:55.031 --> 45:58.785
is necessary
for the commonweal.

45:58.935 --> 46:03.736
An informed citizenry
is what this nation is about.

46:03.895 --> 46:06.906
That is self-serving crap.

46:08.855 --> 46:11.736
"The New York Times"
is a good newspaper...

46:11.894 --> 46:15.102
sometimes. "The Washington Post"
is a good newspaper.

46:15.254 --> 46:19.040
The "LA Times," before it became
a had newspaper, was a good newspaper.

46:19.190 --> 46:21.437
But after that, it's off the cliff.

46:21.590 --> 46:24.667
It's oblivion.
The news business in this country

46:24.822 --> 46:27.321
is nothing to be proud of.

46:27.477 --> 46:30.238
The media is
a technology business.

46:30.388 --> 46:33.466
That's what is.
That's what it has always been.

46:33.620 --> 46:36.828
Technology changes,
the media changes.

46:36.980 --> 46:40.766
Over time, the audience
has switched to the web.

46:40.916 --> 46:44.222
The audience that's
worth a buck in print

46:44.372 --> 46:48.126
is worth a dime and sometimes
a penny on the web,

46:48.275 --> 46:51.897
because we end up
competing oftentimes

46:52.052 --> 46:55.030
against our own work aggregated.

46:55.187 --> 46:58.614
"Newser" is a great-looking site
and you might want to check it out.

46:58.771 --> 47:02.198
Aggregates all manner of content.

47:02.355 --> 47:04.952
But I wonder if Michael's
really thought through

47:05.106 --> 47:07.833
get rid of mainstream
media content.

47:07.986 --> 47:10.201
Okay.

47:10.354 --> 47:11.892
Go ahead.

47:18.833 --> 47:20.753
There are a lot of websites,

47:20.913 --> 47:25.113
the core of their being very often-
not all of them, but some...

47:25.265 --> 47:28.789
is repurposed pieces
by "The Times"

47:28.944 --> 47:32.054
with a sexier headline
or a bigger picture

47:32.208 --> 47:33.976
or bouncing off
of "Times" reporting,

47:34.128 --> 47:35.830
commenting on "Times" reporting.

47:35.984 --> 47:39.061
Places like "Gawker,"
they're going for what

47:39.216 --> 47:41.878
will feed that
Google-beast algorithm.

47:42.031 --> 47:43.472
They'll go to feed the hits.

47:43.632 --> 47:48.018
And how we build a really
rich media environment

47:48.175 --> 47:51.253
where you don't lose
coverage of statehouses,

47:51.407 --> 47:53.273
of Congress is a question.

48:05.165 --> 48:08.471
The big board is anathema
to anyone at "The Times"

48:08.622 --> 48:12.048
or any other traditional
daily newspaper.

48:12.205 --> 48:14.737
It's a list of 10 stories
from our sites

48:14.893 --> 48:16.661
on a big television screen,

48:16.813 --> 48:19.061
which are at that very moment

48:19.212 --> 48:21.613
getting the most buzz,
being distributed

48:21.773 --> 48:23.824
and passed around on the web.

48:23.980 --> 48:26.196
It's our equivalent of the front page.

48:26.348 --> 48:28.945
It's the most visible manifestation
of a writer's success.

48:29.100 --> 48:31.381
We've always been
very much focused on stories

48:31.532 --> 48:33.005
that our readers want.

48:33.163 --> 48:34.768
We're not trying
to force-feed them.

48:34.923 --> 48:36.625
We're trying to give
them what they want.

48:36.780 --> 48:39.955
I have a friend
who's at the Albany bureau

48:40.107 --> 48:42.704
of "The Times." I told him

48:42.859 --> 48:45.106
about the big board,
sent him a picture of it

48:45.259 --> 48:47.310
and "How do you like
our new innovation?"

48:47.467 --> 48:50.739
He was terrified.
Albany corruption stories-

48:50.890 --> 48:54.250
they may be important to cover,
but no one really wants to read them.

48:54.410 --> 48:56.942
The future is to be found elsewhere.

48:57.098 --> 48:59.859
It's a linked economy.
It's search engines.

49:00.010 --> 49:03.185
It's online advertising.
It's citizen journalism,

49:03.337 --> 49:05.585
and if you can't find
your way to that,

49:05.738 --> 49:07.887
then you just can't find your way.

49:08.041 --> 49:11.184
There's nobody covering the cop shop,
nobody covering the zoning hoard.

49:11.337 --> 49:13.715
The day I run into
a "Huffington Post" reporter

49:13.865 --> 49:16.048
at a Baltimore zoning board
hearing is the day that I will-

49:16.200 --> 49:19.146
Senator Kerry, I was not around
when the printing press was invented,

49:19.304 --> 49:21.650
but if I were around,
I would imagine

49:21.801 --> 49:24.300
that the people dealing
with stone tablets

49:24.456 --> 49:26.125
would be making
a similar argument.

49:26.280 --> 49:28.331
There's no way that I can think of

49:28.487 --> 49:31.052
that you can have
a "business model"-

49:31.207 --> 49:32.974
you know, one that
makes a profit...

49:33.127 --> 49:35.310
for investigative reporting.

49:40.615 --> 49:43.473
ProPublica- a very interesting model.

49:43.623 --> 49:45.455
Part of its formula is pairing

49:45.606 --> 49:47.657
with legacy media to get
its information out

49:47.815 --> 49:49.419
in the most effective way.

49:49.574 --> 49:51.723
Everything we do
goes on our website.

49:51.878 --> 49:54.093
But for our biggest stories,
we get a CNN,

49:54.245 --> 49:56.744
a "60 Minutes,"
a "New York Times"

49:56.902 --> 49:58.539
to work with us.

49:58.693 --> 50:02.250
You know, I was 25, 26 years
at "The Journal."

50:02.405 --> 50:05.646
We were absolutely
rolling in money.

50:05.797 --> 50:08.329
Why should you open yourself
to some story

50:08.485 --> 50:10.439
that you didn't know
where it had been?

50:10.597 --> 50:12.615
Who knows what kind of gems
that had gotten on it?

50:12.773 --> 50:15.653
People are open
to new ways of working,

50:15.813 --> 50:17.547
because the world has changed.

50:17.700 --> 50:19.980
Vanden Heuvelz
There's a hybrid model here,

50:20.132 --> 50:22.118
and I do think journalism
is a public good.

50:22.276 --> 50:25.768
And if it's a public good,
then that requires

50:25.923 --> 50:30.211
a whole new mindset about
how you support journalism.

50:30.371 --> 50:32.902
1,000 bloggers
all talking to each other

50:33.059 --> 50:36.169
doesn't get you a report
from a war zone.

50:36.323 --> 50:38.123
Somebody's gotta take a real risk.

50:38.275 --> 50:40.620
There's gotta be some
infrastructure and some pay,

50:40.771 --> 50:43.051
and they've gotta go
and gather that news originally.

50:46.338 --> 50:48.454
A lot of the people
in the Baghdad bureau

50:48.609 --> 50:51.174
were moving to Kabul.
And they asked if there was

50:51.330 --> 50:53.578
anybody who wanted
to volunteer for Baghdad,

50:53.729 --> 50:55.562
and so I'm going to Iraq.

50:57.537 --> 50:59.970
He's done
all these stories on media companies

51:00.129 --> 51:02.027
and, you know,
capital cases and death row.

51:02.177 --> 51:04.523
And Tim is just one
of the guys who wants answers

51:04.672 --> 51:07.302
to really basic questions.
And I think once you've got that

51:07.456 --> 51:09.704
you're curious about
all kinds of things.

51:09.856 --> 51:12.584
Iraq is kind of
off people's radar screens here,

51:12.736 --> 51:14.984
but we still have
120,000 soldiers there

51:15.135 --> 51:17.863
and it's a real crucial point

51:18.015 --> 51:20.743
in terms of seeing
what the last chapter is

51:20.895 --> 51:23.143
for our country there.

51:26.494 --> 51:28.414
The locals who have worked for us,

51:28.574 --> 51:30.723
some have been killed
and kidnapped and- and-

51:30.879 --> 51:32.297
yeah, I worry about that.

51:32.447 --> 51:35.011
But that's something
he wants to do and...

51:36.574 --> 51:39.171
you know,

51:39.326 --> 51:42.207
kind of just hope he'll be okay.

51:46.557 --> 51:49.219
Cheers, to your good health.

51:49.374 --> 51:51.621
Did they tell you
what they want you to do?

51:51.773 --> 51:54.337
I mean, there's no beats.
It's just...

51:54.493 --> 51:56.412
do the day's stories and...

51:56.573 --> 51:59.137
settle in with the Iraqi staff
and write stories, you know.

51:59.292 --> 52:01.441
For the beginning,
it's going to be the election.

52:01.597 --> 52:03.877
You had covered a bunch
of other conflicts, right?

52:04.029 --> 52:05.895
Civil wars and conflicts in Africa.

52:06.044 --> 52:08.030
Somalia-
a lot of time in Somalia.

52:08.188 --> 52:10.752
I did a tour in Yugoslavia
when all that was going on.

52:10.907 --> 52:14.180
Oh really? The only advice they give is
fall into this well-run machine

52:14.332 --> 52:16.994
that's been going on for seven years
and you'll figure it out.

52:17.147 --> 52:20.322
As you may well know,
I expect you to be on TV in a week-

52:20.475 --> 52:23.617
"Those of us who have been
covering this for a while."

52:23.771 --> 52:25.953
"Those of us who have been here
for two days think...

52:46.745 --> 52:50.433
it's been a privilege to work with you.
Come back real soon."

52:50.585 --> 52:52.352
- Thanks for the kind words.
- Cheers!

52:52.504 --> 52:54.588
Stay safe.

53:11.191 --> 53:14.748
It is a history. It is an enormous
compendium of material

53:14.903 --> 53:18.263
that will affect many different people
in different ways.

53:18.423 --> 53:19.961
There has been a massive leak.

53:20.119 --> 53:23.229
There are so many pages
of military secrets now public.

53:23.382 --> 53:27.649
Some of the documents rip the cover off
the US-led war effort in Afghanistan:

53:27.798 --> 53:29.752
Unexplained American deaths,

53:29.910 --> 53:32.125
questionable battlefield tactics

53:32.278 --> 53:34.362
and a mission just
not going that well.

53:34.518 --> 53:38.206
WikiLeaks released
91,000 raw military documents online,

53:38.358 --> 53:41.750
but this time also to three
traditional news organizations

53:41.909 --> 53:44.473
including "The New York Times,"
which vetted the material,

53:44.628 --> 53:47.389
it said, eliminating information
that could put lives at risk.

53:47.541 --> 53:49.592
Well, I think it was
an important moment

53:49.748 --> 53:52.094
that WikiLeaks chose
to go through the "Guardian,"

53:52.244 --> 53:54.361
"Der Spiegel"
and "The New York Times."

53:54.516 --> 53:58.106
In a sense they were detoxifying
the information that they had,

53:58.260 --> 54:01.566
and they were giving it
a little more veracity.

54:01.715 --> 54:03.515
What Julian Assange
realized is that

54:03.668 --> 54:05.566
going through "The Times"

54:05.715 --> 54:07.832
and "Spiegel"
and the "Guardian"

54:07.987 --> 54:10.714
would actually have
a greater impact. He was right.

54:10.867 --> 54:13.082
We as a journalistic group-

54:13.234 --> 54:15.450
the four media groups
who worked on this-

54:15.602 --> 54:17.686
have really only just
scratched the surface.

54:23.922 --> 54:26.835
We've treated them
as an advocacy organization,

54:26.994 --> 54:28.980
but we're partnered with them.

54:29.137 --> 54:31.123
Are we partnered?

54:31.281 --> 54:33.114
I think they're a source.

54:33.265 --> 54:35.349
- But they're a publisher.
- I think they're more like

54:35.505 --> 54:37.272
a source than-
well, you're right.

54:37.424 --> 54:39.705
He's not our media partner.
He's not our collaborator.

54:39.856 --> 54:41.362
He's a source like any other source

54:41.520 --> 54:43.703
giving us access to documents.

54:43.856 --> 54:46.867
They can be a source when they're
a publisher. I think that's very clear.

54:47.024 --> 54:49.523
- We're all in this together.
- But you wonder about the negotiations,

54:49.680 --> 54:51.447
when they come and say,
"You can have this,

54:51.600 --> 54:53.684
but we're going to give it
to other papers,

54:53.839 --> 54:56.338
and you guys are all going
to hold hands." Where we say,

54:56.495 --> 54:59.060
"But we are 'The New York Times,"'
and they say,

54:59.215 --> 55:02.968
"But we have all this
and we are dictating terms."

55:03.119 --> 55:05.465
You can say that. And then can you
turn around and say, "By the way,

55:05.614 --> 55:07.993
'The New York Times' never should
have done this in the first place"?

55:08.142 --> 55:11.634
I really am appalled
by the leak, condemn the leak.

55:11.790 --> 55:15.446
There is potential there
to put American lives at risk.

55:15.598 --> 55:17.235
Do you believe there
should be an investigation

55:17.389 --> 55:19.026
into whether
"The New York Times" broke any laws?

55:19.182 --> 55:22.575
I'm not calling
for prosecution of "The Times,"

55:22.734 --> 55:25.745
but I think they're guilty
of bad citizenship.

55:25.901 --> 55:29.557
The basic calculus
that you try to do in your head

55:29.709 --> 55:32.339
is the trade-off between
the obligation, really,

55:32.492 --> 55:35.438
to give people information
about how they're being governed

55:35.596 --> 55:38.575
and on the other hand,
the government's

55:38.732 --> 55:41.526
legitimate need for secrecy.

55:41.676 --> 55:44.982
I've had a dozen of these instances

55:45.132 --> 55:47.631
where we had
classified information

55:47.788 --> 55:50.068
and had to decide
whether or not to publish it

55:50.220 --> 55:52.500
or publish it with some
parts of it withheld.

55:52.651 --> 55:55.532
Officials at the White House
asked us to communicate

55:55.691 --> 55:58.735
to WikiLeaks
their strong exhortation

55:58.891 --> 56:01.553
that WikiLeaks redact
the documents and take out

56:01.706 --> 56:03.987
the names of people
who might be identified

56:04.138 --> 56:06.866
and put in danger.
And we passed that along.

56:07.018 --> 56:09.745
The oddest thing in the story,
you saw, was that "The Times" said

56:09.898 --> 56:12.625
that the White House asked them
to lobby \MkiLeaks not to print things.

56:12.778 --> 56:14.644
- Yes.
- Which is really odd.

56:14.793 --> 56:17.358
Like, "You're the White House.
Can't you call WikiLeaks?"

56:17.513 --> 56:20.110
- But also we're "The New York Times"-
- "It's 1-800-WikiLeaks."

56:28.809 --> 56:31.602
The supposedly
private cables detail everything

56:31.752 --> 56:34.862
from security threats
to diplomatic dirty laundry.

56:35.016 --> 56:37.297
There are unflattering
views of key allies.

56:37.448 --> 56:40.623
It's the largest release
of diplomatic correspondence ever.

56:40.776 --> 56:43.787
...from highly encrypted
telegrams to email messages

56:43.943 --> 56:47.631
to raw, unfiltered analysis
from embassies and consulates.

56:49.735 --> 56:51.918
I'm still getting messages
from people who think that

56:52.071 --> 56:54.024
I'm a treasonous son of a bitch.

56:54.183 --> 56:56.332
And I'm getting some from people

56:56.487 --> 56:59.465
who think that Julian Assange
is the Messiah

56:59.622 --> 57:01.903
and why did I not
treat him as such?

57:02.054 --> 57:03.854
Many of the media outlets

57:04.006 --> 57:05.992
who had been partnered
with WikiLeaks

57:06.150 --> 57:08.463
now find themselves
trying to figure out

57:08.614 --> 57:13.197
whether this guy
is a villain or a hero.

57:13.349 --> 57:16.262
It would be great if people got
past the debate over WikiLeaks

57:16.421 --> 57:19.018
and the disclosures, and looked
closely at what these are,

57:19.173 --> 57:21.192
which is a real-time history

57:21.349 --> 57:24.622
of the US relationship
with some very important countries.

57:24.772 --> 57:28.078
It is one of the biggest journalistic
scoops in the past 30 years.

57:28.228 --> 57:30.411
And the fact that "The Times"
made it their front page

57:30.564 --> 57:33.422
for weeks shows that,
even as all these papers

57:33.572 --> 57:36.071
are becoming a shadow
of their former selves,

57:36.227 --> 57:38.410
"The Times" is still in the game

57:38.563 --> 57:40.615
and very much leading
the game at this point.

57:40.771 --> 57:43.149
Maybe newspapers are
going to have to supplement

57:43.299 --> 57:45.066
using WikiLeaks
to get their news.

57:45.219 --> 57:47.848
It's unclear what the model is,
but I think it's a sign though

57:48.002 --> 57:51.527
of openness at the paper that
there are many more sources.

57:51.682 --> 57:53.384
In a lot of ways
it's a very positive step,

57:53.539 --> 57:55.437
even though it definitely
is coming at the cost

57:55.586 --> 57:57.735
of a contracting
traditional newsroom.

57:57.890 --> 57:59.757
Like the Chinese say,
it's a very interesting time.

57:59.906 --> 58:01.772
It's kind of a curse,
but it's also a blessing that we live

58:01.922 --> 58:03.176
in interesting times-
especially if you're a journalist.

58:03.330 --> 58:05.708
You should want there to be
interesting things going on,

58:05.858 --> 58:09.578
even if it is also a curse.

58:11.009 --> 58:12.482
"New York Times."

58:12.641 --> 58:14.856
Get your "New York Times"!

58:15.009 --> 58:16.711
Come on, check it out.
Check it out.

58:16.865 --> 58:18.632
Good morning,
"New York Times"?

58:18.784 --> 58:21.250
"New York Times," $2.

58:21.408 --> 58:23.427
"The New York Times"
announced today that it's going

58:23.584 --> 58:25.351
to start charging
for access to its website.

58:25.504 --> 58:27.173
The system
they're going to adopt says

58:27.328 --> 58:30.089
anybody who comes to the site
who's not a paying subscriber

58:30.239 --> 58:33.033
can look at X number
of articles free,

58:33.183 --> 58:35.845
and then when you reach X+1
you'll get a message saying

58:35.999 --> 58:37.985
if you want to keep going,
you've got to pay.

58:38.143 --> 58:39.943
The design of "The Times" paywall

58:40.095 --> 58:42.310
comes this close
to the NPR model,

58:42.462 --> 58:44.895
which is to go to the people
who care most about "The Times"

58:45.054 --> 58:46.854
and say, "You and us, we're partners.

58:47.006 --> 58:48.872
We're keeping this thing afloat."

58:49.022 --> 58:51.487
"As of today
you've lost a daily reader.

58:51.646 --> 58:55.105
If they start charging, I'll change
this away from my homepage."

58:55.262 --> 58:56.899
This was a college friend of mine:

58:57.054 --> 58:58.789
"I want to pay,
but I'm not willing to pay

58:58.941 --> 59:00.861
for information I can
easily find elsewhere.

59:01.021 --> 59:03.302
Sorry, 'New York Times.'
Freedom of information."

59:03.453 --> 59:05.734
I worry about people like
that who have grown up

59:05.885 --> 59:08.646
in that era where
everything was free,

59:08.797 --> 59:12.223
or everything seemed free.
Ifs never free, but...

59:12.380 --> 59:14.693
The economics of this business
have always been that

59:14.844 --> 59:17.888
it required both advertising
and payment from the reader.

59:18.044 --> 59:20.422
And for the last 15 years
on the internet,

59:20.572 --> 59:22.787
we've sort of pretended
that that wasn't true.

59:22.940 --> 59:24.707
This is the end of pretending.

59:24.859 --> 59:28.002
They find it through you.
They click through through you.

59:28.155 --> 59:31.036
They come up with the story,
which is currently free.

59:31.195 --> 59:33.989
So they're still
not getting paid for it.

59:34.138 --> 59:36.768
There's usually advertisements
on the page when they land there.

59:36.922 --> 59:40.479
In many cases, I don't think they're
getting that advertising revenue,

59:40.634 --> 59:44.323
and it certainly isn't covering
the cost of doing business.

59:44.474 --> 59:47.802
My view is that it's still
very early and that-

59:47.962 --> 59:50.723
When you say it's early,
it's not early for "The Denver Post"

59:50.873 --> 59:52.292
or "The Seattle Intelligencer"
or a bunch of folks

59:52.441 --> 59:54.012
who are facing bankruptcy today.

59:54.169 --> 59:56.385
Information historically
was not free.

59:56.537 --> 59:58.785
You had to pay for it
in one way or another.

59:58.937 --> 01:00:01.403
I think what "The Times" says-
"This is what it's worth

01:00:01.561 --> 01:00:03.907
to read our newspaper
every month"...

01:00:04.056 --> 01:00:06.817
will go a long way to establishing

01:00:06.969 --> 01:00:09.980
what people feel they can charge
or maybe what they can't charge.

01:00:10.136 --> 01:00:12.766
It's actually kind of a big day
in the newspaper business.

01:00:12.920 --> 01:00:15.168
And some people may
date this, you know,

01:00:15.319 --> 01:00:18.233
this is the day the whole thing died.
We'll find out.

01:00:18.392 --> 01:00:19.996
People who make prescriptions-

01:00:20.152 --> 01:00:21.756
"They should go do a paywall;
not do a paywall;

01:00:21.911 --> 01:00:24.127
put it all on iPad;
kill the paper product"-

01:00:24.279 --> 01:00:27.138
they're being naive.
They have no idea about the economics

01:00:27.287 --> 01:00:29.688
of running a legacy
print-newspaper business

01:00:29.847 --> 01:00:31.963
and trying to build
an online news business.

01:00:32.119 --> 01:00:35.774
You better hope they figure it out,
because you got like 40 years to go.

01:00:35.927 --> 01:00:38.327
Whereas if we got
our heads chopped off,

01:00:38.486 --> 01:00:42.621
we only have to figure out,
what, 15 more years?

01:00:42.774 --> 01:00:44.541
Oh, fuck that.

01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:49.560
I think I got a lot
longer to go than that.

01:00:49.718 --> 01:00:52.151
- Really?
- My working life or my life life?

01:00:52.309 --> 01:00:54.491
- How old are you?
- 46.

01:00:56.149 --> 01:01:00.054
Somebody's going to tap you
on the shoulder here at 62, 63,

01:01:00.213 --> 01:01:02.646
and say, "That was great.

01:01:02.805 --> 01:01:05.369
Thanks a lot.
Your sheet cake's over there."

01:01:05.524 --> 01:01:08.634
- "Turn in your tablet."
- Turn in your tablet.

01:01:08.788 --> 01:01:09.748
We call it...

01:01:09.908 --> 01:01:11.446
...the iPad.

01:01:16.211 --> 01:01:18.492
I got a glimpse of the future

01:01:18.643 --> 01:01:20.597
this last weekend with the iPad.

01:01:20.755 --> 01:01:25.435
It may well be, you know,
the saving of the newspaper industry.

01:01:25.587 --> 01:01:28.598
And even if the cost is
the end of newspapers as we know it-

01:01:28.754 --> 01:01:31.254
Well, it's better than them
going out of business altogether.

01:01:31.410 --> 01:01:34.291
Why are media companies
so excited about a tablet?

01:01:34.450 --> 01:01:37.079
Well, they see it as a do-over, they see
it as this, they see it as that.

01:01:37.234 --> 01:01:39.896
And then the question becomes,
well yeah, there's lots of people

01:01:40.049 --> 01:01:41.751
who think Apple saved
the music business.

01:01:41.906 --> 01:01:43.826
They didn't save it
on the music business's terms.

01:01:43.985 --> 01:01:46.036
There's lots of people
in the music business saying

01:01:46.193 --> 01:01:48.147
it's incredibly punishing
dealing with those guys.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:49.909
Like, "Oh yeah,
they're my best friend.

01:01:50.065 --> 01:01:52.564
See this? It's a leash."
What makes anybody think

01:01:52.721 --> 01:01:54.936
that's going to be different
for publishers?

01:01:55.089 --> 01:01:57.588
That's why I'm wondering if we're going
to end up screwing ourselves.

01:01:57.744 --> 01:02:00.276
Six, five, four,

01:02:00.432 --> 01:02:03.291
three, two, one.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.192
164 and 232.

01:02:11.343 --> 01:02:13.656
One per buyer.

01:02:13.807 --> 01:02:15.444
It's just amazing
to be able to cover this,

01:02:15.599 --> 01:02:17.334
'cause I think in five years

01:02:17.486 --> 01:02:20.530
this could be, like,
how computers are.

01:02:20.687 --> 01:02:23.665
But it's a little bit
scary down there, actually.

01:02:23.822 --> 01:02:26.452
I'm walking out and people
are like "Congratulations!"

01:02:26.606 --> 01:02:29.432
And it's like I just had a kid
or I just had twins or something.

01:02:29.582 --> 01:02:32.408
You know, I just bought a-
I just bought a computer.

01:02:32.558 --> 01:02:35.318
Is that a bridge to the future?

01:02:35.469 --> 01:02:37.553
Or- oh wait, it's a gallows!

01:02:37.709 --> 01:02:39.444
Ow!

01:02:41.261 --> 01:02:43.509
Right there is the dream come true.

01:02:47.916 --> 01:02:50.611
Let's see you navigate.
Mm, sweet.

01:02:50.765 --> 01:02:53.198
That is a great reading
experience right there.

01:02:53.356 --> 01:02:54.796
You know what it reminds me of?

01:02:54.956 --> 01:02:57.204
- What?
- A newspaper.

01:02:57.356 --> 01:03:00.149
People including me are probably
silly to think, you know,

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.158
Steve Jobs is riding
over the hill like cavalry

01:03:03.307 --> 01:03:05.740
to save the media industry.

01:03:05.899 --> 01:03:07.765
He's driving Apple's stock price.

01:03:07.915 --> 01:03:10.195
And we may have
business in common.

01:03:10.347 --> 01:03:12.595
And what that Venn diagram
of interests is...

01:03:12.747 --> 01:03:14.962
their interests versus our interests-

01:03:15.115 --> 01:03:17.580
that's sort of where the story is.

01:03:32.298 --> 01:03:35.408
I have a lot of great
background conversations,

01:03:35.561 --> 01:03:37.677
but I've got to move people
onto the record.

01:03:37.833 --> 01:03:40.113
Think of what you might
be able to say to me.

01:03:40.265 --> 01:03:42.829
All right, man.
Thanks. Bye-bye.

01:03:50.056 --> 01:03:53.231
You know, you could say being at
"The New York Times" is a big advantage.

01:03:53.383 --> 01:03:56.144
You know, it kinda scares
people when you call them.

01:03:58.151 --> 01:04:01.807
And I also think I sound
sort of weird on the phone.

01:04:01.959 --> 01:04:03.596
And it's like-

01:04:04.871 --> 01:04:07.086
well, do you have time to talk to me?

01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:08.908
Great.

01:04:09.063 --> 01:04:12.718
Um, how long did you
work at the "Trib"?

01:04:14.374 --> 01:04:16.906
It's a big story that hasn't
really been told

01:04:17.062 --> 01:04:18.982
in this kind
of comprehensive way-

01:04:19.141 --> 01:04:21.324
the biggest media bankruptcy
in history,

01:04:21.477 --> 01:04:24.042
billions and billions
of dollars just evaporated,

01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:25.867
a lot of people lost their jobs.

01:04:26.021 --> 01:04:28.847
The people there are still doing,
you know, excellent work,

01:04:28.997 --> 01:04:31.823
but it's under
very difficult circumstances

01:04:31.972 --> 01:04:35.813
from people who manifestly
do not respect what they do.

01:04:40.453 --> 01:04:42.700
Sam Zell,
when he came in, was somebody

01:04:42.852 --> 01:04:45.416
with no experience
running a company like this.

01:04:45.572 --> 01:04:47.950
No news experience.
In fact, a fair bit of contempt

01:04:48.099 --> 01:04:50.794
for sort of traditional
ideas of journalism.

01:04:50.948 --> 01:04:54.221
My attitude on journalism
is very simple:

01:04:54.371 --> 01:04:57.350
I want to make enough money
so I can afford you.

01:04:57.507 --> 01:05:02.188
It's really that simple, okay?
You need to in effect help me

01:05:02.338 --> 01:05:04.771
by being a journalist that focuses

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.185
on what our readers want.

01:05:10.434 --> 01:05:12.387
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:05:12.545 --> 01:05:14.465
I can't, you know,

01:05:14.625 --> 01:05:16.939
you're giving me the classic

01:05:17.089 --> 01:05:19.489
what I would call
journalistic arrogance.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.963
You know, people inside just
sort of get dispirited

01:05:22.113 --> 01:05:24.262
because the company's
being run by these people

01:05:24.417 --> 01:05:26.283
who just don't share
their values.

01:05:26.432 --> 01:05:28.833
Hopefully we get
to the point where our revenue

01:05:28.993 --> 01:05:30.825
is so significant that we can do

01:05:30.977 --> 01:05:33.377
puppies and Iraq, okay?

01:05:38.304 --> 01:05:40.683
Sam Zell wanted to put
Randy Michaels, whom he knew

01:05:40.831 --> 01:05:43.014
from the radio business,
in charge of Tribune Company.

01:05:43.167 --> 01:05:46.113
Michaels then came in and one
of the first things he worked on

01:05:46.271 --> 01:05:48.704
was rewriting
the company's ethics policy

01:05:48.864 --> 01:05:51.907
to basically say, "We're going to be
in a much more permissive atmosphere"

01:05:52.063 --> 01:05:53.830
and you know,
"it's going to be creative

01:05:53.983 --> 01:05:55.717
and there's going
to be things that offend you."

01:05:55.871 --> 01:05:58.435
You know what's important to
the people who buy advertising?

01:05:58.590 --> 01:06:01.253
I don't mean the agencies.
I mean the people who write the checks.

01:06:01.406 --> 01:06:03.326
They want to sell widgets.
They want to move product.

01:06:03.486 --> 01:06:05.864
They want the cash register to ring.
They want butts in seats.

01:06:06.014 --> 01:06:08.392
Some people are like,
"We need something,

01:06:08.542 --> 01:06:11.749
so this could be as good as any."
I mean, it's a kind of...

01:06:11.902 --> 01:06:14.367
you know, it's a sort
of crazy Hail Mary pass.

01:06:14.526 --> 01:06:17.057
So these guys come in,
bought the company.

01:06:17.213 --> 01:06:19.777
This is how they behaved.
This is the result.

01:06:19.933 --> 01:06:22.944
This company,
they drove it into bankruptcy.

01:06:23.101 --> 01:06:25.795
Randy Michaels
and a hand-picked crew of 20 people

01:06:25.948 --> 01:06:28.741
who he's known a long
long time have extracted

01:06:28.892 --> 01:06:31.075
something like
$100 million in bonuses.

01:06:31.228 --> 01:06:33.028
You could call that incentives

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:34.849
or you could call that looting,

01:06:35.003 --> 01:06:36.706
depending on your perspective.

01:06:38.364 --> 01:06:40.230
Yeah, let's just quit typing altogether

01:06:40.379 --> 01:06:42.147
and just talk us girls for a minute.

01:06:42.299 --> 01:06:44.132
I have certain memos about

01:06:44.283 --> 01:06:46.335
behavior of the executives there,

01:06:46.491 --> 01:06:48.771
and I just want to make sure
that they're true.

01:06:48.923 --> 01:06:51.618
In this memo that was
sent to the board,

01:06:51.770 --> 01:06:54.497
there's an incident described
where Randy Michaels

01:06:54.650 --> 01:06:58.436
"talked openly and loudly about
other women's breasts, sex toys...

01:06:58.586 --> 01:07:02.655
not just in closed room
with other executives but openly...

01:07:02.810 --> 01:07:05.821
He wrote the employee handbook
so that kind of talk

01:07:05.977 --> 01:07:10.178
wasn't against the rules."
Does that all sound right?

01:07:10.329 --> 01:07:12.413
I was mostly doing
the bankruptcy stuff,

01:07:12.569 --> 01:07:14.653
and then I saw those poker pictures

01:07:14.808 --> 01:07:17.089
and I thought it seems more like

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:19.008
a radio station in the 1970s

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:21.244
than a great big media company.

01:07:23.704 --> 01:07:27.163
Don't you think that would sell?

01:07:27.320 --> 01:07:31.706
So I cold called
a person from Trib Co.,

01:07:31.864 --> 01:07:33.304
and he lays them out flat:

01:07:33.463 --> 01:07:35.383
who they were,
what they did, etcetera.

01:07:35.543 --> 01:07:37.791
- All on the record. My first of that.
- Yeah.

01:07:37.943 --> 01:07:40.507
I'm doing two more
weeks of reporting,

01:07:40.663 --> 01:07:43.227
then I'm going to take a week
to write it and show it to you.

01:07:43.383 --> 01:07:45.249
All right.

01:07:54.294 --> 01:07:56.826
Tonight at 6:30, NBC will be driving

01:07:56.982 --> 01:07:58.902
in the convoy
with the last combat troops

01:07:59.061 --> 01:08:01.047
as they cross back
into Kuwait.

01:08:01.205 --> 01:08:03.638
I don't think we know much about it.
We're not on the embed,

01:08:03.797 --> 01:08:06.013
partly because
we think it's a PR stunt.

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.380
What do you make of the notion that

01:08:08.533 --> 01:08:10.519
they're trying
to choreograph an exit here?

01:08:10.677 --> 01:08:13.023
In my mind it would be easy
just to fly these trucks out.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.573
They've been
flying trucks out for months.

01:08:15.733 --> 01:08:17.948
But the fact that they want
to drive across the desert

01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:20.861
and bring reporters along with them,
what does that indicate to you?

01:08:39.858 --> 01:08:41.845
That's perfect.

01:08:47.154 --> 01:08:49.466
So let's get started,
please, with media.

01:08:49.618 --> 01:08:51.319
The final fighting brigade

01:08:51.474 --> 01:08:53.787
in the war is going
to be crossing the border

01:08:53.937 --> 01:08:55.956
into Kuwait, as I understand it,

01:08:56.113 --> 01:08:57.499
and there's embeds with-

01:08:57.649 --> 01:08:59.220
"The Washington Post" is there,

01:08:59.377 --> 01:09:00.818
the "LA Times," NBC.

01:09:00.977 --> 01:09:02.645
And we're watching to see if this is

01:09:02.801 --> 01:09:04.917
some sort of end
of the war as we know it.

01:09:05.073 --> 01:09:06.807
But it's complicated.

01:09:06.961 --> 01:09:08.827
If this is just some sort of photo op-

01:09:08.977 --> 01:09:11.890
I get no sense that this is coming
from the administration

01:09:12.048 --> 01:09:15.126
or that it's coming from,
you know, the military.

01:09:15.279 --> 01:09:16.917
It just seems to be...

01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:19.319
so far I get the sense
it's only coming from NBC

01:09:19.471 --> 01:09:21.621
and the other embeds.

01:09:28.238 --> 01:09:30.322
They need their "mission
accomplished" moment.

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:35.957
Okay, now what we won't
be able to predict, obviously,

01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:38.260
is what "The Post" and the "LA Times"
will be doing with it.

01:09:38.413 --> 01:09:40.051
Right, but you know.

01:09:40.206 --> 01:09:42.639
Is anybody, is the White House,
is the military-

01:09:42.798 --> 01:09:45.656
who is saying this is the end
of combat troops in Iraq?

01:09:45.805 --> 01:09:48.883
NBC is saying
that the military will say that.

01:09:49.037 --> 01:09:52.212
They are saying-
NBC is saying they will declare it.

01:09:52.365 --> 01:09:55.475
In other words, NBC will declare it
tonight. NBC's implication is-

01:09:55.629 --> 01:09:58.160
As far as I know, NBC isn't
actually at war in the Middle East.

01:09:58.317 --> 01:09:59.605
I know, I know. I understand.

01:09:59.757 --> 01:10:01.524
But how come,
if people know this is coming-

01:10:01.677 --> 01:10:03.248
And that's why
the White House sent their email.

01:10:03.404 --> 01:10:05.619
- Have I seen this anywhere?
- No, it's under embargo.

01:10:05.772 --> 01:10:07.855
It's totally secret. We're not allowed
to talk about it, that's why.

01:10:08.012 --> 01:10:10.576
- When does the embargo break?
- Hopefully 6:30.

01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:13.296
Okay, guys, thank you very much.

01:10:14.475 --> 01:10:16.494
Okay, bye-bye.

01:10:23.147 --> 01:10:25.525
Good evening.
It's gone on longer than the Civil War,

01:10:25.675 --> 01:10:27.061
longer than World War II.

01:10:27.210 --> 01:10:30.418
Tonight, US combat troops
are pulling out of Iraq.

01:10:30.571 --> 01:10:33.135
And, Richard, I understand
your reporting of this

01:10:33.290 --> 01:10:35.090
at this hour tonight constitutes

01:10:35.242 --> 01:10:37.773
the official Pentagon
announcement, correct?

01:10:37.930 --> 01:10:40.243
Yes it is.
Right now we are with

01:10:40.393 --> 01:10:42.412
the last American combat troops.

01:10:42.569 --> 01:10:43.628
We are with the-

01:10:46.921 --> 01:10:48.754
- Did you watch NBC?
- Yeah.

01:10:48.905 --> 01:10:51.535
I thought it was hallucinatory.
Brian Williams says

01:10:51.689 --> 01:10:54.832
to Richard Engel
that your report here from the field

01:10:54.984 --> 01:10:57.843
amounts to the official
Pentagon announcement

01:10:57.992 --> 01:11:00.491
of the end of
combat troops in Iraq.

01:11:00.648 --> 01:11:02.448
And there is no
Pentagon announcement.

01:11:02.600 --> 01:11:05.165
I mean I'm going over
territory you already know.

01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.266
But let me back up.
We're trying to figure out if...

01:11:08.423 --> 01:11:11.533
I don't know that there was-
I mean, I'm not trying to be difficult.

01:11:11.687 --> 01:11:13.771
- No no no.
- Was there some sort of official-?

01:11:13.927 --> 01:11:16.687
Thom Shanker in Washington
is right now calling the Pentagon again.

01:11:16.839 --> 01:11:19.632
If I weren't thinking about this every
day, I would look at this and think,

01:11:19.783 --> 01:11:21.518
"What just happened?"

01:11:21.670 --> 01:11:22.958
- I mean...
- You would think,

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:25.489
- is the war over and I missed it?
- Yeah.

01:11:25.639 --> 01:11:27.209
So we just heard from Shanker,

01:11:27.366 --> 01:11:29.035
who talked to the Pentagon
five minutes ago,

01:11:29.190 --> 01:11:30.794
and he said there was
no official anything today.

01:11:30.950 --> 01:11:32.587
What the fuck's going on?

01:11:32.742 --> 01:11:34.574
If you were
watching "NBC Nightly News,"

01:11:34.726 --> 01:11:36.558
you would have thought
there was a big ceremony

01:11:36.710 --> 01:11:39.055
of some kind to commemorate
the final end of combat operations.

01:11:39.205 --> 01:11:40.743
I was flabbergasted by it
because I didn't understand.

01:11:40.901 --> 01:11:42.800
- That's news to the Pentagon.
- Hi, it's Ian.

01:11:42.949 --> 01:11:46.440
Did Thom specifically ask
the Pentagon guy, "Did you see NBC?"

01:11:46.597 --> 01:11:49.226
This is making everyone here
completely insane.

01:11:49.381 --> 01:11:52.556
Look, I mean we could do
the there-was-a-made-for-TV moment.

01:11:52.708 --> 01:11:54.628
I don't know whether
we even need to...

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:56.588
I'll leave that to you.

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.751
But I'm not sure it even wants
to tum the knife a little bit.

01:11:59.907 --> 01:12:02.406
The Pentagon or somebody's
calling this mission...

01:12:02.564 --> 01:12:05.357
that is the mission to drive across
the border... "The Last Patrol."

01:12:05.508 --> 01:12:08.007
So there's something going on.

01:12:10.499 --> 01:12:12.419
- Right?
- Right.

01:12:12.579 --> 01:12:15.405
The White House has been fucking
saying it's at the end of the month.

01:12:15.555 --> 01:12:18.119
"The White House spokesman
immediately sent out a second email

01:12:18.274 --> 01:12:19.747
saying it's at the end of the month."

01:12:19.907 --> 01:12:22.252
How do you cover the end
of a war that's not ending?

01:12:22.402 --> 01:12:25.129
- Right, exactly.
- I mean, even wars that end badly

01:12:25.282 --> 01:12:27.781
end up with, like,
helicopters leaving the Saigon roof.

01:12:27.938 --> 01:12:29.542
This isn't even going to be that.

01:12:29.698 --> 01:12:31.400
I think that story should be written.

01:12:31.553 --> 01:12:33.158
I do. I think you're right.

01:12:33.313 --> 01:12:35.080
I don't think tonight
is the night to write it.

01:12:35.233 --> 01:12:36.870
Let me start
to get something ready

01:12:37.025 --> 01:12:38.945
and let's talk again
in half an hour.

01:12:41.184 --> 01:12:43.617
So I think we're all standing
around trying to figure out

01:12:43.776 --> 01:12:46.089
whether this is
a real story or a media story,

01:12:46.240 --> 01:12:50.026
which doesn't really... isn't very
flattering to media reporters, is it?

01:12:50.176 --> 01:12:53.449
"Stand down, we think
it's actually something happening."

01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:55.433
No, we're not going
to write anything.

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:57.602
There's still 56,000 in Iraq,

01:12:57.759 --> 01:12:59.679
and the AP notes correctly

01:12:59.839 --> 01:13:01.793
that all of them are combat troops

01:13:01.951 --> 01:13:04.035
until they're redesignated otherwise,

01:13:04.191 --> 01:13:05.631
which hasn't actually happened.

01:13:05.790 --> 01:13:08.256
I'm only wondering if...

01:13:08.414 --> 01:13:11.295
are our betters going
to come in tomorrow and say,

01:13:11.454 --> 01:13:13.505
"Gee, everybody
covered this but us?"

01:13:13.663 --> 01:13:16.162
Uh, there appears to be
no indication that way.

01:13:16.318 --> 01:13:17.606
All right. Good.

01:13:17.757 --> 01:13:20.005
So I think we're all right.

01:13:20.158 --> 01:13:22.919
I'm going to wear
my combat helmet just in case.

01:13:24.830 --> 01:13:27.263
The function
of reporting and the press

01:13:27.421 --> 01:13:29.701
is the best obtainable
version of the truth.

01:13:29.853 --> 01:13:32.231
We're not out there
to bring down governments.

01:13:32.381 --> 01:13:34.629
We're not out there
to be prosecutors.

01:13:34.781 --> 01:13:37.159
We're out there to be judicious,

01:13:37.309 --> 01:13:38.727
not judicial.

01:13:38.876 --> 01:13:41.375
And that's really what
happened in Watergate.

01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.158
In recent months,
members of my administration

01:13:45.308 --> 01:13:47.424
have been charged
with involvement in what has

01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:49.795
come to be known
as the Watergate Affair.

01:13:49.947 --> 01:13:52.413
We began covering
the Watergate story

01:13:52.571 --> 01:13:55.550
the day after there was a break-in
at Democratic headquarters,

01:13:55.707 --> 01:13:58.620
and we continued to cover it
for more than two years.

01:13:58.779 --> 01:14:00.699
In the first year,

01:14:00.858 --> 01:14:03.357
we wrote more than 100 stories.

01:14:03.515 --> 01:14:05.533
The story was not
one dam breaking.

01:14:05.691 --> 01:14:07.458
It was story after story after story,

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:10.305
and it was really pretty much
owned by "The Washington Post."

01:14:10.458 --> 01:14:12.673
In the House of Representatives,

01:14:12.826 --> 01:14:15.620
there is not a member left who thinks
the president will not be impeached.

01:14:15.769 --> 01:14:19.228
It really pains me to say it.
I grew up with "The Washington Post,"

01:14:19.386 --> 01:14:21.437
and you can't say

01:14:21.593 --> 01:14:24.899
that the diminishment of that paper,

01:14:25.049 --> 01:14:27.428
in terms of its scale of its staff

01:14:27.577 --> 01:14:30.076
and its ambitions, haven't affected it.

01:14:30.233 --> 01:14:32.993
You'd be kidding yourself
to say it's just trimmed some fat.

01:14:33.144 --> 01:14:36.636
No, economic circumstances
have made it a lesser paper.

01:14:36.792 --> 01:14:38.876
If that were to happen
in any serious way

01:14:39.032 --> 01:14:41.826
to "The New York Times,"
that would be a terrible tragedy.

01:14:47.287 --> 01:14:49.054
You know, I get the Twitter feeds

01:14:49.207 --> 01:14:51.738
and read the blogs about how media

01:14:51.895 --> 01:14:53.794
will or won't fare in the digital age.

01:14:53.943 --> 01:14:57.533
But sometimes they seem to have
it all boiled down to an aphorism.

01:14:57.687 --> 01:15:01.179
I'm not sure that I can boil it
all down to a sort of "aha."

01:15:01.334 --> 01:15:03.517
But I do think

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.819
there's a growing sense

01:15:05.974 --> 01:15:08.855
of how much it would matter
if "The Times" weren't here.

01:15:09.013 --> 01:15:11.359
News organizations
that deploy resources

01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:13.528
to really gather
information are essential

01:15:13.685 --> 01:15:15.769
to a functioning democracy.

01:15:15.926 --> 01:15:19.036
It just doesn't work
if people don't know.

01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:22.909
When you read
"The New York Times" today,

01:15:23.060 --> 01:15:25.625
in the business section
you will see

01:15:25.781 --> 01:15:28.640
the obituary
of the newspaper industry.

01:15:28.788 --> 01:15:31.101
Jesus, what a bunch of pussies!

01:15:31.252 --> 01:15:33.118
I'm not a newspaper guy.

01:15:33.268 --> 01:15:35.548
I'm a businessman.

01:15:41.907 --> 01:15:43.707
It's really important to remember

01:15:43.859 --> 01:15:46.260
that the consequences
of this bankruptcy

01:15:46.419 --> 01:15:50.140
did not just fall on the employees
at the Tribune Company.

01:15:50.290 --> 01:15:52.855
In Los Angeles, in Chicago,

01:15:53.011 --> 01:15:54.964
in Hartford, in Baltimore,

01:15:55.123 --> 01:15:58.330
the diminution of those newspapers
crippled or destroyed

01:15:58.482 --> 01:16:01.363
important community civic assets.

01:16:03.698 --> 01:16:06.131
Well yeah, it's going to be
a pretty rugged story,

01:16:06.290 --> 01:16:09.781
and I want it to be, uh- fair,

01:16:09.938 --> 01:16:11.858
which is why I'm calling you.

01:16:12.017 --> 01:16:14.810
I mean if you want me
to characterize the overall story,

01:16:14.961 --> 01:16:18.071
what I would say is that this
was an overleveraged company

01:16:18.224 --> 01:16:22.294
that Mr. Zell operated
into bankruptcy,

01:16:22.448 --> 01:16:25.624
handed this kind of
flaming baton off to Mr. Michaels.

01:16:25.776 --> 01:16:27.696
Michaels brought in guys

01:16:27.856 --> 01:16:30.867
from his career in radio
to help them out.

01:16:31.023 --> 01:16:33.969
Overall, a lot of people
lost a lot of money.

01:16:34.128 --> 01:16:36.212
Employees are out contributions.

01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:38.713
This sounds like it's going to be

01:16:38.863 --> 01:16:40.369
a top-to-bottom hatchet job.

01:16:40.527 --> 01:16:42.578
Where... where is the hatchet?

01:16:42.734 --> 01:16:44.240
I don't... I... I don't...

01:16:44.398 --> 01:16:48.184
if there's a countemarrative, um,

01:16:48.335 --> 01:16:51.194
I'm happy to talk about it.

01:16:51.342 --> 01:16:53.808
If there's a heroic narrative,
I'm happy to talk about it.

01:16:53.966 --> 01:16:56.246
We haven't even gotten
into the cultural issues,

01:16:56.398 --> 01:16:58.863
which I'm sure are not going
to please you much at all.

01:16:59.022 --> 01:17:01.335
Let's cut to something
a little more hard and fast.

01:17:01.485 --> 01:17:03.405
On December 11th, 2008,

01:17:03.565 --> 01:17:06.544
your board received in a letter-
it was anonymous-

01:17:06.701 --> 01:17:10.389
alleging a broad pattern
of sexual harassment.

01:17:10.541 --> 01:17:15.571
...had received oral sex
on the 22nd-floor balcony.

01:17:15.724 --> 01:17:17.644
She also added that in a meeting

01:17:17.804 --> 01:17:20.979
...suggested that
her assistant come in

01:17:21.132 --> 01:17:23.445
and perform a sexual act

01:17:23.596 --> 01:17:25.779
on him to cheer him up.

01:17:25.931 --> 01:17:29.324
This is not 1977.
This is 2010,

01:17:29.483 --> 01:17:32.080
and those kinds of things

01:17:32.235 --> 01:17:35.029
are material for the people
that work there.

01:17:35.179 --> 01:17:37.678
It created a work environment
that people say

01:17:37.835 --> 01:17:39.734
is closer to a frat house

01:17:39.882 --> 01:17:41.966
than a front-line media company.

01:17:42.122 --> 01:17:43.508
So that's in there.

01:17:43.658 --> 01:17:46.451
5,459.

01:17:46.602 --> 01:17:48.468
Well, that's not going to happen.

01:17:48.618 --> 01:17:51.214
He's got probably
6,000 words of good stuff.

01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:53.902
Now every editor and writer
thinks they've got good stuff,

01:17:54.058 --> 01:17:55.695
but he really does
have good stuff.

01:17:55.849 --> 01:17:58.610
It's well written,
very very sharply reported.

01:17:58.762 --> 01:18:00.464
It sticks to the facts,

01:18:00.617 --> 01:18:02.385
fantastic quotes from people.

01:18:02.537 --> 01:18:05.483
Your board looked
into these matters,

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.855
had their law firm make calls.

01:18:08.009 --> 01:18:10.125
What did they conclude?

01:18:10.281 --> 01:18:13.259
I'm trying to figure out
why that is important.

01:18:13.416 --> 01:18:16.045
Well, because" because
there's people who are out

01:18:16.199 --> 01:18:18.066
billions of dollars in debt,

01:18:18.215 --> 01:18:20.299
who are going to decide whether

01:18:20.455 --> 01:18:23.434
the current management is
going to stay in place.

01:18:23.591 --> 01:18:25.969
There's judges that are
going to decide whether

01:18:26.119 --> 01:18:29.130
they're worthy of bonuses
that are on the table.

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:31.567
I will see what I can find out
and we'll get back to you.

01:18:31.718 --> 01:18:34.315
Okay, you have both my numbers,
so let me know.

01:18:42.246 --> 01:18:45.040
What should I know
before I listen to my messages?

01:18:46.213 --> 01:18:48.679
He was willing to start friendly.

01:18:48.837 --> 01:18:52.361
I brought up widespread
sexual harassment.

01:18:52.518 --> 01:18:55.823
So when he calls and says
I can't get this shit together-

01:18:55.973 --> 01:18:58.318
I should probably get this.

01:18:58.469 --> 01:19:00.171
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:19:00.325 --> 01:19:01.929
You shouldn't be here.

01:19:02.084 --> 01:19:04.681
Bruce Headlam.

01:19:04.837 --> 01:19:06.124
How are you?

01:19:06.276 --> 01:19:08.076
You have a couple things
going for you.

01:19:08.228 --> 01:19:10.411
He is one of the most
fair-minded people I know.

01:19:10.563 --> 01:19:12.615
That's one thing.

01:19:12.772 --> 01:19:14.310
He's a very diligent reporter.

01:19:14.467 --> 01:19:16.453
We don't do hit jobs.

01:19:16.612 --> 01:19:18.281
That's not the business we're in.

01:19:18.436 --> 01:19:21.447
The story we were led to,
we were led to by the reporting.

01:19:21.603 --> 01:19:24.462
Let me talk to my bosses,
see what they're thinking.

01:19:24.610 --> 01:19:27.240
You talk to your bosses,
see what they're thinking.

01:19:27.394 --> 01:19:29.031
And maybe we can look at it

01:19:29.187 --> 01:19:31.369
a little more dispassionately

01:19:31.523 --> 01:19:33.290
in the morning.
Fair enough?

01:19:33.443 --> 01:19:36.323
You guys have negotiated
this issue to the exclusion

01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:38.565
of everything else.
And now all of a sudden

01:19:38.722 --> 01:19:41.668
you want to broaden out the discussion
four hours before we close?

01:19:41.826 --> 01:19:44.204
We're interested
in getting responses from you.

01:19:50.305 --> 01:19:52.007
They're sending a letter

01:19:52.161 --> 01:19:54.114
from the law firm.

01:19:54.272 --> 01:19:55.909
It'll be staking out a position.

01:19:56.065 --> 01:19:58.051
If we say we're going
to go with that,

01:19:58.208 --> 01:20:00.521
then another letter will
come from the law firm,

01:20:00.673 --> 01:20:03.204
and that will be...

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:06.273
contain threats of legal action.

01:20:07.647 --> 01:20:09.447
They're worried
this is a hatchet job.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.683
They're worried where
the reporting started,

01:20:11.840 --> 01:20:13.128
all that kind of thing.

01:20:13.279 --> 01:20:15.112
The muscles of the institution

01:20:15.263 --> 01:20:16.998
are going to kick in here
at some point.

01:20:17.151 --> 01:20:19.878
It's not really up to me.

01:20:40.861 --> 01:20:44.385
We need institutions that have

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:47.006
the ability both financially

01:20:47.164 --> 01:20:49.412
and culturally

01:20:49.565 --> 01:20:51.169
to bring news

01:20:51.324 --> 01:20:55.198
that other institutions
and individuals cannot.

01:21:02.300 --> 01:21:05.126
I think part
of what goes on with conferences now

01:21:05.275 --> 01:21:07.905
is it's sort of lonely
and scary out there.

01:21:08.059 --> 01:21:11.332
It's a way to sort of
gather around a campfire

01:21:11.483 --> 01:21:14.145
and say,
"We're all right. Aren't we?

01:21:14.298 --> 01:21:16.350
Are we okay?

01:21:16.507 --> 01:21:18.940
We're fine.

01:21:19.098 --> 01:21:21.957
We must be.
We have badges on."

01:21:25.305 --> 01:21:29.921
- So.
- What are you doing for supper tonight?

01:21:30.073 --> 01:21:33.314
I'm going to eat
with the AA guys.

01:21:33.465 --> 01:21:35.648
- Oh yeah?
- Are you skinny?

01:21:35.801 --> 01:21:38.595
How skinny are you?

01:21:38.745 --> 01:21:41.407
- 131.
- You're short now too.

01:21:41.561 --> 01:21:44.354
- Yeah.
- You used to be like six feet tall.

01:21:44.504 --> 01:21:47.515
- I was at least.
- Is that going to happen to me?

01:21:47.673 --> 01:21:49.920
- See, my neck is already bent over.
- Yeah.

01:21:56.631 --> 01:21:58.879
Thank you so much.

01:21:59.032 --> 01:22:00.985
Please welcome David Carr.

01:22:07.319 --> 01:22:10.625
You have lived through
the worst cyclical,

01:22:10.774 --> 01:22:12.345
secular recession

01:22:12.502 --> 01:22:14.848
the publishing business
has ever seen

01:22:14.998 --> 01:22:16.798
in modern times.

01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:18.936
Look around you.
You're still here.

01:22:19.094 --> 01:22:21.277
Don't think about
the people that are gone.

01:22:21.430 --> 01:22:23.711
Think about the people
that made it.

01:22:23.861 --> 01:22:25.661
It's a really big deal.

01:22:25.814 --> 01:22:27.680
It's demonstrates,
number one,

01:22:27.829 --> 01:22:30.110
that you are a bunch
of tenacious motherfuckers,

01:22:30.261 --> 01:22:32.127
I'll tell you that.

01:22:32.277 --> 01:22:34.776
You have proven you
cannot be killed!

01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:49.112
I've always thought
it was a little bit of a caper

01:22:49.268 --> 01:22:52.127
that I ended up working
at "The New York Times."

01:22:52.275 --> 01:22:54.142
I don't think I was destined

01:22:54.291 --> 01:22:56.604
to be the best Timesman
there ever was.

01:22:56.755 --> 01:22:59.482
I just didn't want
to screw it up.

01:22:59.635 --> 01:23:02.362
I would find it unspeakable
if "The New York Times"

01:23:02.514 --> 01:23:04.762
ended up
in a diminished place,

01:23:04.915 --> 01:23:07.348
but "The New York Times"
does not need to be

01:23:07.507 --> 01:23:09.558
a monolith to survive.

01:23:16.817 --> 01:23:19.676
Welcome, everybody.
We're here to take note of the fact

01:23:19.826 --> 01:23:22.423
that journalism is alive
and well and feisty,

01:23:22.577 --> 01:23:24.530
especially at
"The New York Times."

01:23:37.456 --> 01:23:40.599
Just like a paper tiger

01:23:43.248 --> 01:23:47.252
Torn apart by idle hands...

01:23:53.711 --> 01:23:55.249
We'll see you in a little while.

01:23:57.167 --> 01:24:00.048
I Fix yourself while you still can I

01:24:03.214 --> 01:24:09.106
Â¤ The deserts down below us... Â¤

01:24:09.262 --> 01:24:11.727
I always find French posters
of American films funny.

01:24:11.885 --> 01:24:14.034
Orson Welles has a size 28 waist.

01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:16.339
Doesn't look like
any newspaperman I know

01:24:16.493 --> 01:24:18.195
or anybody I see up
in the cafeteria,

01:24:18.349 --> 01:24:20.149
even though we have
a salad bar.

01:24:22.540 --> 01:24:26.294
Â¤ Like a paper tiger Â¤

01:24:26.444 --> 01:24:28.976
Â¤ In the sun Â¤

01:24:29.132 --> 01:24:32.918
Â¤ Looking through
a broken diamond Â¤

01:24:35.371 --> 01:24:38.764
Â¤ To make the past what it should be Â¤

01:24:42.219 --> 01:24:45.940
Â¤ Through the ruins
and the weather Â¤

01:24:48.171 --> 01:24:51.859
Â¤ Capsized boats in the sea Â¤

01:24:55.626 --> 01:24:59.085
Â¤ The deserts down below us Â¤

01:25:01.641 --> 01:25:05.963
Â¤ And the storms up above Â¤

01:25:07.977 --> 01:25:11.851
Â¤ Like a stray dog gone defective Â¤

01:25:13.929 --> 01:25:17.584
Â¤ Like a paper tiger Â¤

01:25:17.737 --> 01:25:21.097
Â¤ In the sun Â¤

01:25:28.519 --> 01:25:32.753
Â¤ We're just holding on to nothing Â¤

01:25:35.016 --> 01:25:38.921
Â¤ To see how long nothing lasts Â¤

01:25:41.958 --> 01:25:45.799
Â¤ The deserts down below us Â¤

01:25:47.878 --> 01:25:51.534
Â¤ And the storms up above Â¤

01:25:53.574 --> 01:25:57.862
Â¤ Like a stray dog gone defective Â¤

01:26:00.134 --> 01:26:04.106
Â¤ Like a paper tiger Â¤

Â¤ In the sun Â¤

01:26:56.641 --> 01:27:00.329
Â¤ There's one road to the morning Â¤

01:27:02.849 --> 01:27:06.918
Â¤ There's one road to the truth Â¤

01:27:09.216 --> 01:27:13.384
Â¤ There is one road back
to civilization Â¤

01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:19.234
Â¤ But there's no road back to you Â¤
