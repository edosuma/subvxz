WEBVTT

00:22.370 --> 00:24.546
My father was responsible
for my husband getting killed.

00:24.633 --> 00:26.504
Lombardi, no!

00:26.591 --> 00:27.897
What's the matter,
boss? It's what you wanted.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.379
Please, Joe,
I want my freedom.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.642
I can't keep living in a cage
like this.

00:33.729 --> 00:37.733
If I let you go and something
happens to you, I'm dead!

00:37.820 --> 00:39.604
So shut the fuck up about it
and make the best of things!

00:39.691 --> 00:41.737
You're full of shit!

00:41.824 --> 00:43.652
Omar wants to work
for Malcolm.

00:43.739 --> 00:46.742
And even if he's sincere,
my feelings get in the way.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.788
I believe in what Malcolm
is doing with all my heart.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.530
But I'm not gonna lie to you,
Elise. I still love you.

00:52.617 --> 00:55.577
The U.S. government trying
to intimidate me, even overseas.

00:55.664 --> 00:57.144
It means I'm getting
under their skin.

00:57.231 --> 00:59.842
Here, let me
share something with you.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.887
<i>- Oh, qué es eso?
- Cocaína.</i>

01:01.974 --> 01:03.411
This shit ain't like duji, man.

01:03.498 --> 01:06.457
And if this Colombo motherfucker
landed the duji,

01:06.544 --> 01:08.155
then we need to find
something else to sell.

01:08.242 --> 01:10.983
Only rich white folks
buy that shit.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.724
Just run the idea by Bumpy.

01:12.811 --> 01:14.987
You won't be participating
in the next shipment.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.773
The Corsicans have agreed
to make me their sole buyer.

01:17.860 --> 01:20.950
If you want to sell any dope,
you're gonna have to buy from me

01:21.037 --> 01:23.518
like every other motherfucker
in this town.

01:27.826 --> 01:32.092
Ask me, life is like
a hand of cards.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.833
You play the hand
you're dealt.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.488
Can't win by folding.

01:37.575 --> 01:39.186
Sometimes you gotta take
a chance if you want to win.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.797
Would you stop messing
with my concentration?

01:41.884 --> 01:43.451
I'm not.
I was just--

01:43.538 --> 01:44.800
I know your tricks, Ellsworth.

01:47.716 --> 01:49.457
Gin.

01:52.503 --> 01:56.942
104. I win.

01:57.029 --> 02:00.772
I've taken just about
as many losses as I can today.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.383
You're not talking
about gin rummy.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.994
No, I'm not.

02:05.081 --> 02:07.083
I am proud of you.

02:07.170 --> 02:10.042
Getting out of the duji
business was the right move.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.393
Both practically
and morally.

02:12.480 --> 02:17.659
Without the duji, my other
businesses have suffered.

02:17.746 --> 02:21.445
My relationship
with Jose Battle, it's suffered.

02:21.532 --> 02:23.578
There are other growth
opportunities all around

02:23.665 --> 02:25.797
if you really take a look.

02:25.884 --> 02:27.712
What about
Palmetto Chemical?

02:27.799 --> 02:30.150
That is a legitimate business
that can grow.

02:30.237 --> 02:34.110
Mayme, it does well,
but it's a small concern.

02:34.197 --> 02:36.504
Not if you get
a federal contract.

02:36.591 --> 02:40.029
I have heard through Powell's
office that after the riots,

02:40.116 --> 02:42.553
they're giving them out
to more black businesses.

02:42.640 --> 02:43.424
They'll never give me
one of those.

02:43.511 --> 02:45.556
We can try.

02:45.643 --> 02:48.037
I got a criminal record.

02:48.124 --> 02:50.996
Those kind of contracts
go out to white businesses

02:51.083 --> 02:52.955
with political contacts.

02:53.042 --> 02:56.654
I have contacts, too,
you know.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.134
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:58.221 --> 03:00.180
- Got contacts?
- Yeah, I do, I do.

03:00.267 --> 03:04.096
And a federal contract
could mean millions of dollars.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.795
You're so sexy when
you say "millions." Hm.

03:06.882 --> 03:08.449
Maybe I'll surprise you.

03:08.536 --> 03:10.059
You surprise me
all the time.

03:11.539 --> 03:14.063
Bumpy fucking Johnson.

03:14.803 --> 03:19.068
His pride, it gets in the way
of his business sense.

03:19.155 --> 03:21.201
You ain't got
that blind spot.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.596
That's why you're here?

03:27.990 --> 03:29.948
Look, I got
the French connection.

03:30.035 --> 03:35.606
I mean, if Bumpy Johnson doesn't
want to deal with me, fine.

03:35.693 --> 03:38.218
But what's to stop <i>you?</i>

03:38.305 --> 03:41.786
You could flood the Barrio with
this stuff and make millions.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.311
Bumpy's my partner.

03:44.398 --> 03:46.617
I don't stab my partner
in the back.

03:46.704 --> 03:49.011
I respect that.

03:49.098 --> 03:52.623
Loyalty is everything
in our world.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.104
But, Jose, so is survival.

03:56.888 --> 03:59.151
My father used to say,

03:59.239 --> 04:02.503
<i>"Un hombre no es un plátano."</i>

04:02.590 --> 04:05.854
"A man is not a banana."

04:05.941 --> 04:10.250
You don't just eat the fruit
and throw away the skin.

04:10.337 --> 04:13.340
You don't want
to choke on it either.

04:13.427 --> 04:16.604
Here's my offer.

04:16.691 --> 04:22.827
Last year, I made $12 million
on my car operation alone.

04:22.914 --> 04:24.655
Come in with me.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.831
Bring your own hombres.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.660
50-50 on whatever
you bring in.

04:29.747 --> 04:31.836
Plus the heroin.

04:31.923 --> 04:33.664
Very generous.

04:33.751 --> 04:39.627
And a 300K cash bonus
just for the opportunity

04:39.714 --> 04:41.193
to earn your friendship.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.676
I appreciate the offer.

04:47.635 --> 04:48.766
But I must say no.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.685
Come to me when you realize
you're supposed to toss

04:54.772 --> 04:57.775
the fuckin' banana peel.

04:57.862 --> 05:00.212
Nobody eats that shit.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.650
Not even the apes.

Colombo's cops
cut off the duji

06:41.052 --> 06:43.707
coming in from the Canadians
and the Turks.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.361
And the Chinese don't fuck
with nobody

06:45.448 --> 06:48.146
but their own, so that it?

06:50.366 --> 06:53.804
We outta the dope game.

06:53.891 --> 06:58.113
Bump, we get you don't want
to buy from Colombo.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.246
But outta the game? Shit.

07:01.333 --> 07:05.337
Nat and Junie are both too
damn old to learn how to sew.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.252
Ya dig?

07:07.339 --> 07:09.690
Plus, we're losing
business everywhere, Bump.

07:09.777 --> 07:12.127
The Geechee, the cat houses,
the numbers.

07:12.214 --> 07:14.912
Shit, without drugs,
them guineas gonna wipe us out.

07:14.999 --> 07:17.393
I know. That's what I'm tryin'
to figure the fuck out here.

07:17.480 --> 07:19.482
Then I think
you should hear Nat out.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.528
He's got something.

07:21.615 --> 07:23.965
I think
we can work with it.

07:24.052 --> 07:25.053
Go on.

07:33.931 --> 07:35.846
- Cocaine?
- Yeah.

07:35.933 --> 07:38.196
Shit's got some action
in the Barrio.

07:38.283 --> 07:41.112
It's not like duji,
but folks is starting to buy.

07:41.199 --> 07:42.984
Who can afford cocaine
in the Barrio?

07:43.071 --> 07:45.552
It's getting doled out
small amounts.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.728
Exactly.
It's impossible to get in bulk.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.207
Right, Junie?

07:49.294 --> 07:50.513
The Latins smuggle it in
by the ounce.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.515
Ain't no real money
in that.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.866
But if we can get it in bulk,
I think we can move it, Bump.

07:55.953 --> 07:59.043
Plus, cocaine don't turn folks
into fiends like duji do.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.567
No, it's a pick-up.

08:00.654 --> 08:01.829
Lights a wick
up your ass.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.265
I know what it does.

08:04.962 --> 08:06.007
How'd you get it?

08:06.094 --> 08:07.878
This dude
who knows Battle.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.881
But he's no longer
in the picture.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.840
I'd talk to Battle
before Colombo

08:12.927 --> 08:14.145
starts whispering in his ear.

08:14.232 --> 08:16.408
I'm sure
he already has.

08:19.281 --> 08:20.456
Hmm.

08:23.198 --> 08:24.939
Look.
Look at that.

08:25.026 --> 08:28.464
I can't go anywhere without one
of his goons on my tail.

08:28.551 --> 08:31.075
Can't imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.424
No. You can't.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.035
It's like
I'm under house arrest.

08:34.122 --> 08:36.951
Stella, your father's
number-one concern,

08:37.038 --> 08:38.561
over and above everything,
is your safety.

08:38.648 --> 08:41.085
Get me out of here.

08:41.172 --> 08:42.565
I could speak to your father
again, but in his eyes,

08:42.652 --> 08:44.219
Joe Colombo's
doing a very good job,

08:44.306 --> 08:45.829
minding the store
and also protecting you, and--

08:45.916 --> 08:47.439
He's trying to fuck me.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.096
I find it difficult to believe
he could be so stupid.

08:52.183 --> 08:54.229
He comes onto me nonstop.

08:54.316 --> 08:55.926
He even took me out
to a fancy dinner.

08:56.013 --> 08:57.537
Alright,
this is important.

08:57.624 --> 09:00.931
Did he make a direct
sexual advance on you?

09:01.018 --> 09:04.108
Would you call telling me he has
a large penis a sexual advance?

09:04.195 --> 09:06.110
Well, that depends.

09:06.197 --> 09:07.851
Look, all I'm saying is,

09:07.938 --> 09:09.853
I don't want to be
under his protection.

09:09.940 --> 09:11.942
I can protect myself.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.597
Tell my father
that's all I want.

09:14.684 --> 09:19.254
And, please, don't mention
the sex stuff.

09:19.341 --> 09:22.213
I'm just sharing that
with you.

09:22.300 --> 09:23.388
Promise?

09:25.956 --> 09:28.045
I will do what I can.

09:33.355 --> 09:36.140
References, receipts, ledgers.
It seems simple enough to me.

09:36.227 --> 09:40.231
Save for
one debilitating factor--

09:40.318 --> 09:42.625
your husband.

09:42.712 --> 09:45.672
What about my husband?

09:45.759 --> 09:48.326
Bumpy is a convicted felon.

09:48.413 --> 09:51.591
That automatically
disqualifies him.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.984
He is also a pillar
of this community.

09:54.071 --> 09:55.769
No one mentioned
his prison record

09:55.856 --> 09:58.380
when he donated thousands
of dollars to your campaign.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.991
I am very grateful
for Bumpy's generosity,

10:01.078 --> 10:03.211
but that does not absolve
his criminal record.

10:03.298 --> 10:05.082
How can a man move forward

10:05.169 --> 10:08.520
if the government keeps
shutting the door in his face?

10:08.608 --> 10:10.000
Palmetto Chemical

10:10.087 --> 10:11.654
is a legitimate
extermination business

10:11.741 --> 10:14.526
that has been in Harlem
for decades.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.007
Why can't it be considered
for a government contract?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.140
Bumpy's name on a bid
for government funds

10:19.227 --> 10:21.142
will never happen.

10:21.229 --> 10:24.667
What if it were
in someone else's name?

10:24.754 --> 10:26.321
My name?

10:26.408 --> 10:27.888
Eh.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.368
I can't advise you to do
something like that.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.371
But on the other hand,
a lot of these contracts

10:33.458 --> 10:35.896
go to
mob-controlled entities

10:35.983 --> 10:38.159
with supposedly
legitimate front men.

10:38.246 --> 10:40.291
Hmm. Do they now.

10:41.815 --> 10:44.208
Eh, look, I am not a lawyer,
so you--

10:44.295 --> 10:46.341
You didn't hear it from me.

10:49.605 --> 10:51.215
I tell you something, man.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.000
You better figure out
something fast,

10:53.087 --> 10:56.090
because you're gonna drag me
down the toilet with you.

10:56.177 --> 10:58.048
Colombo tell you that
himself?

10:58.135 --> 11:00.050
Upstairs, over a cafecito?

11:00.137 --> 11:02.444
Yeah, man.
He came, he wanted to talk.

11:02.531 --> 11:03.967
I said, "Okay, let's talk."

11:04.054 --> 11:05.926
I listened to him.
You know what I said?

11:06.013 --> 11:07.536
I said, "I don't fuck
my partners."

11:07.623 --> 11:09.364
I'm sure he made you
an extremely generous

11:09.451 --> 11:11.409
and bullshit offer.

11:11.496 --> 11:14.238
Hey, what the fuck
is your problem now, man?

11:14.325 --> 11:16.153
Now you suddenly too good
to sell dope?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.589
That was your fucking pitch
in the first place!

11:17.677 --> 11:20.462
Have you seen the streets
of Harlem?!

11:20.549 --> 11:24.248
Junkies half dead
on every corner.

11:24.335 --> 11:26.947
Tell me, Jose, if you could
reclaim your homeland,

11:27.034 --> 11:30.646
would you pump poison
out on the streets?

11:30.733 --> 11:34.084
I'm done
with the duji business.

11:34.171 --> 11:37.697
But I got a solution.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.568
Please.

11:39.655 --> 11:41.222
My man Pettigrew,

11:41.309 --> 11:43.746
he got this off of one
of your associates here.

11:49.839 --> 11:51.623
Cocaine?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.538
Who the fuck is gonna buy
that shit?

11:53.625 --> 11:56.106
If that keeps moving through
the Barrio,

11:56.193 --> 12:00.415
even in small quantities,
you got a possible gold mine.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.984
By selling ounces?

12:04.071 --> 12:05.681
You know what a pain
in the fucking ass

12:05.768 --> 12:08.379
it is to bring cocaine up
to New York City?

12:08.466 --> 12:10.642
It's manufactured
in Colombia and Peru

12:10.730 --> 12:13.776
and has to go through Cuba
as a transshipment point.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.431
Yeah, and whatever's left
is seized

12:16.518 --> 12:19.695
and burned the fuck up
by the CIA, right?

12:19.782 --> 12:21.697
I read it in the paper.

12:21.784 --> 12:25.832
It could be used to fund
your operations against Castro.

12:25.919 --> 12:27.355
Come on.

12:34.710 --> 12:37.669
Okay, man.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.280
Okay.

12:39.367 --> 12:42.326
But I gotta do
something first.

12:42.413 --> 12:45.677
Yeah, let me guess--
Consult with your advisor.

12:54.774 --> 12:58.603
Something is clearly
on your mind.

12:58.690 --> 13:01.171
Omar's asked me out
on a date.

13:01.258 --> 13:03.217
I don't think I should go.

13:03.304 --> 13:05.523
Oh, you're afraid you'll fall
into temptation?

13:05.610 --> 13:07.699
Yeah, right. Afraid I'll toss
my drink in his face.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.353
I thought
you'd forgiven him.

13:09.440 --> 13:11.486
A few lines of poetry
and an apology

13:11.573 --> 13:15.098
hardly seem like enough to
absolve him after all he's done.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.318
Omar's doing his best.

13:17.405 --> 13:21.191
But if I can forgive him,
Elise, then you can, too.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.106
He ain't asking <i>you</i> out
on a date.

13:25.717 --> 13:27.589
Well, my instinct tells me

13:27.676 --> 13:31.854
that Omar's sincerely
seeking redemption.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.551
The courting phase
of a relationship

13:33.638 --> 13:36.816
is such a precious time.

13:38.948 --> 13:42.386
It builds the foundation for
the years you'll spend together.

13:42.473 --> 13:45.389
Do I even want years
with Omar?

13:45.476 --> 13:47.174
Only you can judge that.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.832
But I want to see you happy, Elise.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.313
You deserve that.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.882
Don't get in your own way.

14:30.347 --> 14:31.783
How's it looking?

15:05.382 --> 15:10.300
She's saying betrayal
is never an act of an enemy,

15:10.387 --> 15:12.520
but of a friend.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.130
She's saying
I'm gonna betray you?

15:14.217 --> 15:15.784
No, no. She's saying we need
to be cautious

15:15.871 --> 15:17.829
with both enemies and friends.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.618
What about
the cocaine business?

15:23.705 --> 15:24.924
Is that good for us?

15:27.100 --> 15:28.362
Madrina...

15:48.121 --> 15:52.516
She says no warning
against cocaine business.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.518
Th--
That's a good thing, right?

15:57.478 --> 15:59.219
We can move forward.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.786
I'm gonna introduce you
to my man in the CIA.

16:01.873 --> 16:04.311
They call him "Wild Bill."

16:05.355 --> 16:06.748
What do you got?

16:06.835 --> 16:08.706
Alpha 66
claims it has a mole

16:08.793 --> 16:10.752
inside the kitchen
of Castro's compound.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.014
A mole
in Castro's kitchen?

16:12.101 --> 16:13.624
Yeah, okay.
Tell me more.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.539
It says a new member
of Alpha 66

16:15.626 --> 16:17.802
has a "nephew inside
the kitchen staff

16:17.889 --> 16:19.979
who has access
to Castro's ice cream."

16:20.066 --> 16:22.546
- Could be credible.
- Yeah, Castro likes ice cream.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.026
Sounds like bullshit.

16:24.113 --> 16:25.767
What new member
of Alpha 66?

16:25.854 --> 16:28.726
A Gustavo Martinez
in Union City.

16:28.813 --> 16:30.380
Arrived on a raft
two months ago.

16:30.467 --> 16:31.686
Two months?

16:31.773 --> 16:32.730
Well, who's he got here
at home?

16:32.817 --> 16:34.384
A wife, kid?
How old?

16:34.471 --> 16:36.560
No family listed,
no date of birth, no address.

16:36.647 --> 16:38.649
Then how the fuck
can you say he's credible?

16:38.736 --> 16:40.564
He's a double agent
working for Castro, not us.

16:40.651 --> 16:42.088
- Get rid of him.
- You don't want to question him

16:42.175 --> 16:43.959
before we put him
on a boat back to Cuba?

16:44.046 --> 16:46.483
No, and no, not a <i>boat.</i>
A <i>bullet.</i>

16:46.570 --> 16:48.398
You're pissing me off.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.574
What else?

16:50.661 --> 16:52.620
Jose Battle called.

16:52.707 --> 16:55.971
Now, that is
a tough son of a bitch.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.973
That's how we're gonna
kill that cocksucker Castro.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.757
Motherfuckers like that.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.630
Jose Battle does not fuck around
with chocolate ice cream.

17:02.717 --> 17:04.936
He's all about getting
on that soil with artillery

17:05.024 --> 17:06.938
and making the kill-shot.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.680
Says he wants you to meet with
him and his business partner.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.160
Bumpy Johnson.

17:11.247 --> 17:12.640
Yeah, my guys told me
about Johnson.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.685
He can help us, too.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.818
Bumpy Johnson can help us?

17:16.905 --> 17:18.428
Jose.

17:18.515 --> 17:19.951
<i>¿Cómo estás, hermano?</i>

17:33.139 --> 17:34.792
Hey, Stella.

17:34.879 --> 17:36.055
How you doing?

17:36.142 --> 17:37.708
- Fine.
- Mind if I come in?

17:37.795 --> 17:39.754
Yeah, sure.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.061
Hey, you got the palm
on the wall.

17:42.148 --> 17:44.411
My mother
does the same thing.

17:44.498 --> 17:46.978
She would bug me to get
ashes on Ash Wednesday.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.632
You get the ashes, right?

17:48.719 --> 17:50.765
Yeah. I do.

17:50.852 --> 17:54.595
- Every year.
- Mind if I sit?

17:54.682 --> 17:56.162
I used to hate getting
that big cross

17:56.249 --> 17:58.425
right smack in the middle
of your forehead.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.774
They'd put it right
fuckin' there.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.123
Ba-boom.

18:01.210 --> 18:02.864
Right above this big nose.

18:02.951 --> 18:04.561
You just come
from my father?

18:04.648 --> 18:06.346
Yeah.

18:06.433 --> 18:09.349
Fineman told him about
what's going on with Colombo.

18:09.436 --> 18:13.918
Needless to say, he's--
Well, he's none too happy.

18:14.005 --> 18:17.661
So am I free
of Colombo's protection?

18:17.748 --> 18:20.751
Your father wanted me
to come here and reassure you--

18:20.838 --> 18:23.014
That's no longer
gonna be a problem.

18:29.151 --> 18:30.892
What are you saying?

18:30.979 --> 18:34.200
What I'm saying is,
you're not gonna have to worry

18:34.287 --> 18:35.984
about Joe Colombo anymore.

18:38.987 --> 18:41.598
Wait, no.

18:41.685 --> 18:42.991
I want him off my back.

18:43.078 --> 18:45.515
I never said
I wanted him hurt.

18:45.602 --> 18:46.734
Well, Stella,
he did it to himself.

18:46.821 --> 18:48.736
I mean, he's got to go.

18:48.823 --> 18:50.520
Your pops doesn't like the way
he's running business either.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.522
He don't trust him anymore.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.829
I'm gonna be your protection
going forward.

18:56.874 --> 18:58.093
Hey.

18:58.180 --> 18:59.573
Listen, Colombo's guys,

18:59.660 --> 19:02.576
they're dangerous,
and I'm defenseless.

19:02.663 --> 19:03.881
I need a gun.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.970
A gun?

19:06.057 --> 19:08.930
Look, I'm gonna have two
of my guys outside at all times.

19:09.017 --> 19:10.540
Besides, your father
would kill me.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.847
Kill you? He'll kill you
if I get shot,

19:12.934 --> 19:15.154
is what you
should be thinking.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.546
Come on, Lombardi.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.766
I know how to use a gun.

19:18.853 --> 19:20.594
Don't leave me defenseless.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.991
I gotta be crazy.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.211
Okay.

19:29.298 --> 19:31.082
Here.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.041
That's a 380 Walther.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.086
You didn't get this
from me.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.751
Mmm.
These eggs are divine.

19:47.838 --> 19:49.710
I can never get
my poaching water right.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.102
A pinch of salt
does the trick.

19:51.190 --> 19:52.539
Mm.

19:52.626 --> 19:56.107
With what you're asking
for, it--

19:56.195 --> 19:58.153
it shouldn't be difficult
to transfer

19:58.240 --> 20:00.721
Palmetto's ownership
to your name.

20:00.808 --> 20:02.679
And Ellsworth
approves of this?

20:02.766 --> 20:05.116
Oh, I believe I have
his full blessing.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.553
Landing
a contract like this

20:06.640 --> 20:08.032
could really
change things for us.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.947
You're right.
A government contract

20:10.034 --> 20:14.561
for extermination services
would be extremely lucrative.

20:14.648 --> 20:17.955
However, we have
a longevity issue.

20:18.042 --> 20:20.088
How do you mean,
"longevity"?

20:20.175 --> 20:22.003
I can't simply put the company
in your name.

20:22.090 --> 20:25.789
I mean, I could, but the
government does due diligence

20:25.876 --> 20:27.922
on awarding contracts.

20:28.009 --> 20:32.622
They'll look at least 10 years
into a company's past.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.189
I see.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.973
So they wouldn't award
that kind of money

20:36.060 --> 20:38.628
to someone who'd only owned
the company for two days?

20:38.715 --> 20:42.153
No, but there is a way
to "massage" the records

20:42.241 --> 20:46.680
so it seems like you've
owned it for a lot longer.

20:46.767 --> 20:48.595
Well, that's not legal.

20:48.682 --> 20:52.076
Let's just say
it's legal-adjacent.

20:52.163 --> 20:54.644
Nothing a little clever
bookkeeping won't fix.

20:54.731 --> 20:57.081
Archie does things like that
all the time.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.735
Everyone does it.

20:58.822 --> 21:01.216
Of course, my services
are pro bono for now,

21:01.303 --> 21:03.958
but if you are awarded
the contract,

21:04.045 --> 21:07.178
I'll need 5% of the gross.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.703
3%.

21:11.922 --> 21:15.578
Well, 3% of $5 million
is still $150,000.

21:19.756 --> 21:23.891
You have a deal.

21:28.635 --> 21:32.160
Jose says you have
a proposition for us.

21:32.247 --> 21:36.033
The CIA incinerates hundreds of
kilos of cocaine a month.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.601
How about you turn it
over to us?

21:38.688 --> 21:41.648
We sell it, a quarter of
the profits go to you

21:41.735 --> 21:43.824
and the fight
against Castro.

21:43.911 --> 21:46.043
Who the hell
are you gonna sell it to?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.349
Cocaine's a novelty
in New York.

21:47.436 --> 21:48.655
You don't have buyers.

21:48.742 --> 21:50.309
Don't worry.
That's on me.

21:52.920 --> 21:55.705
If you can't move
the shit and you get caught

21:55.792 --> 21:57.403
with that kind of volume,
the Feds get involved,

21:57.490 --> 21:59.013
it's in the papers,
and we're all fucked.

21:59.100 --> 22:01.276
I'll move it.
Trust me.

22:01.363 --> 22:06.325
Harvey, imagine the army
we could build with that money.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.679
It's an attractive proposition.

22:15.159 --> 22:16.683
Siltations like this,

22:16.770 --> 22:19.729
usually there's a little, uh,
tit for tat.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.340
Quid pro quo.

22:22.863 --> 22:24.821
I'm listening.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.214
We have something you want.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.303
You have something we want.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.218
And what would that be?

22:30.305 --> 22:31.915
Intimate access to Malcolm X.

22:33.395 --> 22:35.179
We're aware of your history.

22:35.266 --> 22:38.313
We know that you've been
providing him with protection.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.141
Yeah. So?

22:40.228 --> 22:44.754
So what we don't know
is what he achieved in Africa.

22:44.841 --> 22:49.803
We need who he met with,
when, and why.

22:49.890 --> 22:53.937
We assume a record has been
kept by your daughter, Elise.

22:56.200 --> 23:01.031
You get us that, you boys
can have all the coke you want.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.044
I lied to my father
about Joe Colombo.

23:18.397 --> 23:22.052
I can't be responsible
for another murder.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.228
There's already too much blood
on my hands.

23:24.315 --> 23:27.406
Stella, I've known you
since you were a baby.

23:28.972 --> 23:32.715
I know your heart,
as does the Lord.

23:32.802 --> 23:34.935
You're not a murderer.

23:35.022 --> 23:37.154
Death seems
to follow me everywhere.

23:37.241 --> 23:38.895
I feel trapped by it.

23:38.982 --> 23:41.376
There's no curse upon you.

23:41.463 --> 23:45.467
Only you can bring evil
upon yourself.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.991
You must pray
for redemption.

23:48.078 --> 23:49.079
Pray for help.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.951
I've done that.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.257
Over and over.

23:53.344 --> 23:54.998
And it doesn't do any good.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.087
You mustn't say that.

24:01.091 --> 24:04.094
I'm speaking to you
as your uncle,

24:04.181 --> 24:06.836
as your blood,
as your family.

24:06.923 --> 24:09.143
Not just a priest.

24:09.230 --> 24:11.493
Get ahold of yourself.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.061
If you think that
you've done something

24:14.148 --> 24:15.845
that's going to cause harm,

24:15.932 --> 24:19.153
then you must do everything
in your power to undo it.

24:19.240 --> 24:20.546
What if it's too late?

24:22.809 --> 24:25.289
There's no such thing
as "too late."

24:25.376 --> 24:27.161
Life is eternal.

24:27.248 --> 24:30.251
Our time on this Earth
is limited.

24:30.338 --> 24:33.210
So you must use your time
to do good,

24:33.297 --> 24:36.431
and as best you can...

24:36.518 --> 24:38.825
right wrongs.

24:43.046 --> 24:48.008
So the CIA wants to know
who I met with, where, and when,

24:48.095 --> 24:50.576
and the contents
of these private conversations.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.447
That's right.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.275
What about what I had for
breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

24:54.362 --> 24:55.885
Or how many times
I used the toilet?

24:55.972 --> 24:57.800
It's not funny.

24:57.887 --> 24:59.933
I think the CIA has already
tried to kill Malcolm.

25:00.020 --> 25:02.849
He was poisoned in Cairo.

25:02.936 --> 25:06.243
And if you think they're after
me now, wait a few more days.

25:06.330 --> 25:09.551
What's in a few more days?

25:09.638 --> 25:13.033
I'm working with my new friend
Che Guevara to expose

25:13.120 --> 25:15.209
the United States government
at the United Nations

25:15.296 --> 25:17.298
over their human rights abuses
all over the world.

25:17.385 --> 25:19.953
Created through alliances
with leaders from Egypt,

25:20.040 --> 25:22.346
Tanzania, Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, and Kenya.

25:22.433 --> 25:24.784
I didn't run into any closed
doors, closed minds,

25:24.871 --> 25:25.785
or closed hearts.

25:25.872 --> 25:27.613
Except the CIA's.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.224
Now I get why they wanted me
to snitch about Africa.

25:30.311 --> 25:33.619
Well, if the heat wasn't on
before, it's certainly on now.

25:33.706 --> 25:36.143
Look...

25:36.230 --> 25:38.101
I'm gonna give
the CIA information.

25:40.451 --> 25:41.975
<i>False</i> information.

25:42.062 --> 25:43.803
False information
to the CIA?

25:43.890 --> 25:45.500
Do you have any idea what
you're getting yourself into?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.589
I'm sure as hell not gonna
cooperate with them.

25:47.676 --> 25:50.113
I think the question is,
brother--

25:50.200 --> 25:52.115
Can't you just say no
and walk away?

25:52.202 --> 25:54.291
No.

25:54.378 --> 25:55.945
For business reasons.

25:56.032 --> 25:57.425
Of course.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.383
For you, it's always
about business.

25:59.470 --> 26:02.125
The CIA is just another
criminal organization.

26:02.212 --> 26:03.736
They just have to be dealt with.
That's it.

26:03.823 --> 26:06.129
But giving false information
to the CIA--

26:06.216 --> 26:09.045
That could put you in jail,
or worse.

26:09.132 --> 26:12.266
You build your alliances
your way,

26:12.353 --> 26:14.921
and I'll build mine my way.

26:23.190 --> 26:24.583
Mm.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.545
Oh.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.982
Hello, Elise.

26:33.069 --> 26:37.596
I'd offer you a glass,
but I know you don't drink wine.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.640
Are you okay?

26:38.727 --> 26:40.511
I'm fine.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.688
I'm just doing some business
for your father.

26:42.775 --> 26:45.342
Daddy's up to all kinds
of business these days.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.867
What's that supposed
to mean?

26:47.954 --> 26:49.477
Nothing.

26:51.479 --> 26:53.307
I am submitting
Palmetto Chemical

26:53.394 --> 26:56.266
for a government contract.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.138
And you think the government's
gonna award

26:58.225 --> 26:59.661
Bumpy Johnson
with a contract?

26:59.748 --> 27:01.315
No.

27:01.402 --> 27:04.057
That's why I'm putting
the company in my name.

27:05.624 --> 27:08.583
I mean,
it's not entirely legal,

27:08.670 --> 27:12.326
but Ellsworth deserves this
as much as anyone.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.502
I'm just-- I'm trying
to right a wrong.

27:14.589 --> 27:16.199
With a wrong.

27:16.286 --> 27:19.507
If your father had
the right opportunities,

27:19.594 --> 27:22.379
he could build an empire.

27:22.466 --> 27:23.685
Legitimately.

27:23.772 --> 27:27.036
You can't change him, Mayme.

27:27.123 --> 27:29.952
Better to accept him
for who he is.

27:30.039 --> 27:32.215
He <i>can</i> change.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.566
By forging documents?

27:35.654 --> 27:38.091
The only one changing here
is <i>you.</i>

27:52.322 --> 27:54.237
So, how's this gonna happen?

27:56.849 --> 28:00.330
Harvey will meet us Friday
at the facility.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.202
If you bring the information
on Malcolm X,

28:02.289 --> 28:05.727
he's gonna give us 12 kilos
of cocaine Friday night.

28:05.814 --> 28:08.208
12 kilos for a test run.

28:08.295 --> 28:10.036
That's what I wanted
to hear.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.300
But here's the thing,
Bumpy--

28:13.387 --> 28:15.694
You gotta be straight
with them.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.090
Explain.

28:28.358 --> 28:32.623
You, your daughter,
and Malcolm X one hour ago.

28:35.365 --> 28:39.456
You gotta be really careful
with these spooks.

28:39.543 --> 28:41.371
I wouldn't be surprised
if they have a picture of you

28:41.458 --> 28:44.418
scratching your ass
in your silk pajamas.

28:44.505 --> 28:46.202
Harvey give this to you?

28:49.075 --> 28:50.554
That's good to know.

28:52.861 --> 28:55.559
These guys
have eyes everywhere.

29:08.529 --> 29:10.444
- Thank you, good brother.
- Thank you.

29:18.626 --> 29:20.715
Elise.

29:22.238 --> 29:24.327
You are
absolutely stunning.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.287
So are you.

29:27.374 --> 29:30.507
Elise, this is my mother, Khadijah.

29:30.594 --> 29:32.335
As-salamu alaykum.

29:32.422 --> 29:33.641
Thank you for being
our chaperone

29:33.728 --> 29:34.555
to keep halal
for our date.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.209
Wa-Alaikum-Salaam.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.733
You are just as beautiful
as Omar said you were.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.529
He's spoken
so highly of you,

29:52.616 --> 29:54.270
and the great influence
you've had on him.

29:54.357 --> 29:57.099
Omar can't say enough
wonderful things about you.

29:57.186 --> 29:58.927
Is that so?

29:59.014 --> 30:02.713
He hasn't smiled so much
since Zahira was still with us.

30:02.801 --> 30:06.369
I was worried he'd never find
happiness again,

30:06.456 --> 30:09.546
but then, Mashallah,
he found you.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.374
- Mashallah.
- Mashallah.

30:11.461 --> 30:13.420
Omar! Haram!

30:13.507 --> 30:16.379
You know you mustn't touch her
until you're married.

30:16.466 --> 30:19.513
Forgive me, Mother.
I don't know what came over me.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.515
That's why I'm here.

30:21.602 --> 30:24.387
I raised my son to be a proper
Muslim man before Allah.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.781
You did a very good job.

30:26.868 --> 30:29.262
The only shameful thing
he's ever done

30:29.349 --> 30:32.221
was to get himself exiled
from the Nation of Islam,

30:32.308 --> 30:33.919
all because of that
roguish Malcolm X.

30:34.006 --> 30:35.746
Mother, please...

30:35.834 --> 30:37.357
That evil man
has slandered

30:37.444 --> 30:40.229
the Messenger
just too many times.

30:40.316 --> 30:43.232
Malcolm is risking his life
to fight for our freedom.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.147
He deserves respect,
regardless of his quarrel

30:45.234 --> 30:47.802
with Elijah Muhammad.

30:47.889 --> 30:51.240
Omar, I thought you said
Elise was an intelligent woman.

30:51.327 --> 30:52.763
Mother, I beg you--

30:52.851 --> 30:54.417
Allah forbids you
join your life

30:54.504 --> 30:56.680
to someone who follows
the promises of a fool,

30:56.767 --> 30:58.857
and clearly,
this woman is a fool.

30:58.944 --> 31:00.554
Mother, that's enough!

31:00.641 --> 31:02.773
As-salamu alaykum.
Can I interest you in--

31:25.753 --> 31:28.669
I need you
to see my father now.

31:28.756 --> 31:30.976
What's the matter?

31:31.063 --> 31:33.674
Tell him I said to call off
this hit on Colombo.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.458
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:35.545 --> 31:37.112
I do not know what that means.
A hit?

31:37.199 --> 31:38.592
- What is that?
- Oh, would you cut the shit?!

31:38.679 --> 31:40.376
I-I do not know
what you're referencing.

31:40.463 --> 31:42.901
I am not involved in
whatever you are referring to.

31:42.988 --> 31:46.252
I was lying about him
trying to fuck me.

31:46.339 --> 31:52.649
I did it because I can't stand
being under his protection.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.825
That was a grave mistake.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.566
I know.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.613
And since you obviously
told that to my father,

31:59.700 --> 32:01.658
now you've gotta get him
to call it off.

32:01.745 --> 32:03.660
The die has been cast.

32:05.662 --> 32:07.490
As his attorney,
I am obligated

32:07.577 --> 32:09.797
to tell Mr. Gigante
everything I hear.

32:09.884 --> 32:11.320
Your father
flew into a rage.

32:11.407 --> 32:13.409
He was put into
solitary confinement.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.498
I have no way
to access him.

32:15.585 --> 32:17.979
There's nothing I can do.

32:18.066 --> 32:20.025
Get me a meeting
with Lombardi.

32:20.112 --> 32:21.896
I don't want to get
in the middle of a--

32:21.983 --> 32:24.986
Or I'll tell my father
that you tried to fuck me, too.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.336
You threatening me?

32:27.423 --> 32:28.903
Yes.

32:30.949 --> 32:32.602
Okay. Okay.

32:32.689 --> 32:36.432
I-I will make sure Lombardi
comes to see you.

32:37.477 --> 32:38.826
Good.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.355
I have to tell you,
for the first time,

32:46.442 --> 32:49.358
you really remind me
of your father.

32:54.711 --> 32:56.887
This ain't the police
or the Feds, Bump.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.455
And if you give 'em
some bullshit information

32:59.542 --> 33:02.067
and they find out, you can
kiss all that coke goodbye.

33:02.154 --> 33:03.982
We gotta be real careful
about this, Bump.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.071
Those CIA cats
do not play.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.508
This ain't no tit-for-tat
like we do on the streets.

33:08.595 --> 33:11.728
Think I don't know that, Del?

33:11.815 --> 33:15.254
Chin told me that these
motherfuckers killed Kennedy

33:15.341 --> 33:17.473
- with the help of the mob.
- Damn.

33:17.560 --> 33:20.650
Hey, word in Spanish Harlem
is that the CIA got mobsters

33:20.737 --> 33:22.913
to take a whack at Castro
in Cuba.

33:23.001 --> 33:24.785
Said they was pissed
because Castro knocked them

33:24.872 --> 33:28.310
outta Havana,
cost their asses millions.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.833
Where'd you hear that?

33:29.920 --> 33:30.747
Yeah, I heard it from one
of Battle's men

33:30.834 --> 33:32.401
over at Casa Havana.

33:32.488 --> 33:36.405
Said it was some kinda
hush-hush operation.

33:36.492 --> 33:39.321
Del, get me Carlo Gambino
on the phone.

33:39.408 --> 33:40.496
I wanna set a meeting.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.020
Yeah.

33:43.847 --> 33:46.589
So you've owned
Palmetto Chemical for 10 years,

33:46.676 --> 33:48.635
and you employ 50 people?

33:48.722 --> 33:51.594
Yes.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.988
I expanded the number of workers
so that the government

33:54.075 --> 33:55.772
would deem us capable
of a large contract.

33:55.859 --> 33:57.687
Yes. I see.

33:57.774 --> 33:59.428
Mr. Marshall?

33:59.515 --> 34:01.430
My specialty is evaluating
procurement contracts,

34:01.517 --> 34:02.692
and a sudden rise
in the workforce

34:02.779 --> 34:04.303
could be flagged, Congressman.

34:04.390 --> 34:06.609
Oh. How many people
really work there?

34:06.696 --> 34:07.741
Oh, I don't know.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.917
It's probably closer to 20.

34:10.004 --> 34:13.790
Well, then let's put down 30,
uh, to be safe.

34:13.877 --> 34:15.923
I mean, they know
when awarding these contracts

34:16.010 --> 34:17.577
to small businesses
that they are allowed

34:17.664 --> 34:19.535
to expand their workforce.

34:19.622 --> 34:20.928
More jobs for Harlem.

34:21.015 --> 34:22.625
- That's wonderful.
- Wonderful.

34:22.712 --> 34:25.324
I'm not sure creating facts
is a good idea.

34:25.411 --> 34:28.631
Guess who gets
these extermination contracts

34:28.718 --> 34:30.459
from the government.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.461
The mob. The white mob.

34:32.548 --> 34:34.898
The Luccheses,
the Gambinos.

34:34.985 --> 34:38.076
Why not let a Black mobster
get it for once?

34:38.163 --> 34:41.166
So now you're advocating equal
opportunity to Black mobsters?

34:41.253 --> 34:44.734
I am advocating jobs for
unemployed Harlem workers

34:44.821 --> 34:47.433
by any goddamn means necessary!

34:47.520 --> 34:52.394
As a lawyer, I have to recommend
you wash your hands of this.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.702
Is Palmetto Chemical

34:55.789 --> 34:57.965
a legitimate business,
or is it not?

34:58.052 --> 34:59.575
It is very legitimate.

34:59.662 --> 35:01.969
It's done legitimate work
in Harlem for years.

35:02.056 --> 35:04.798
And according to rumor,
laundered money as a drug front.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.192
Can you prove that?

35:07.279 --> 35:09.585
No.

35:09.672 --> 35:11.500
Submit the application.

35:11.587 --> 35:13.763
And, Mayme, good luck.

35:20.074 --> 35:22.685
Stella, that's not
how things work in our world.

35:22.772 --> 35:24.383
You're given an order,
you follow it.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.775
What, you're telling me
like I haven't lived

35:25.862 --> 35:27.951
my entire life
in this world?

35:28.038 --> 35:30.171
Eh, you know where the guys
who don't follow orders are?

35:30.258 --> 35:31.868
The bottom
of the Gowanus Canal.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.480
No, guys botch jobs
all the time.

35:34.567 --> 35:36.177
That's not me.
I'm sorry.

35:36.264 --> 35:37.874
When your father says,
"Take care of Colombo,"

35:37.961 --> 35:39.876
I take care of Colombo.

35:39.963 --> 35:41.617
Nothin' I can do
about it.

35:49.321 --> 35:52.585
I can't be responsible
for another person's death.

35:56.632 --> 35:57.938
Hey.

35:58.025 --> 36:00.245
I know you've been
through a lot.

36:00.332 --> 36:03.857
What happened to Ernie
was awful.

36:03.944 --> 36:07.904
But for what it's worth,
it was very painful for me, too.

36:07.991 --> 36:10.559
- It was?
- Yeah.

36:10.646 --> 36:11.647
You guys just got married.

36:11.734 --> 36:13.606
Plus, I liked Ernie.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.564
I didn't want to off him.

36:15.651 --> 36:17.958
But I had to do it
'cause I had an order.

36:18.045 --> 36:20.569
Your father, after he gave me
the order, changed his mind,

36:20.656 --> 36:23.268
tried to get to me,
but it was too late.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.226
I thought my father
killed Ernie.

36:25.313 --> 36:26.836
No.

36:26.923 --> 36:29.448
Your father
tried to stop it.

36:29.535 --> 36:30.753
Breaks my heart.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.103
Breaks
your father's heart, too.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.804
Truth is, Stell, this Colombo,
he could never be trusted.

36:37.891 --> 36:39.501
I advised your father
against it.

36:39.588 --> 36:41.590
I think Colombo's gonna make
a play for Harlem,

36:41.677 --> 36:44.898
all the while
playing nice with Chin.

36:44.985 --> 36:46.204
- You do?
- Yeah.

36:47.814 --> 36:50.512
Now, don't you want
to protect your dad,

36:50.599 --> 36:52.166
after all you put him through?

36:55.996 --> 36:57.780
Yes.

36:57.867 --> 36:59.217
Okay.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.914
Okay, here's the plan.

37:01.001 --> 37:04.265
Now, it's just you and him
in the office, right?

37:04.352 --> 37:08.095
He's got guys outside,
but yeah, it's just me and him.

37:08.182 --> 37:09.792
Okay.

37:09.879 --> 37:11.881
I'm gonna tell Colombo
I'll be by about 7:00 p.m.

37:11.968 --> 37:13.927
with instructions
from Chin.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.189
When I walk in,
you walk out.

37:15.276 --> 37:16.930
Say, uh-- I don't know.

37:17.017 --> 37:19.062
Say you have to go to the
ladies' room or something.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.108
Before you know it, it's over. Boom.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.502
The men outside won't even
hear the shot

37:23.589 --> 37:26.244
over the fucking car crushers
you got in the junkyard.

37:29.029 --> 37:32.162
We've known each other
for a long time, Gambino.

37:34.295 --> 37:36.558
It hasn't
always been peaceful.

37:36.645 --> 37:38.081
True.

37:38.168 --> 37:41.041
A lot of ups and downs, huh?

37:41.128 --> 37:45.088
We haven't talk just
the two of us for years.

37:46.002 --> 37:49.179
The pleasure of that being
that you and I,

37:49.267 --> 37:53.227
we don't, uh,
bullshit each other.

37:53.314 --> 37:56.143
Want some walnuts?

37:56.230 --> 37:58.101
No, thanks.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.799
That's right.

37:59.886 --> 38:00.974
We don't bullshit
each other.

38:01.061 --> 38:02.802
We never have.

38:02.889 --> 38:04.760
Which brings me to this--

38:04.847 --> 38:08.024
Wh-- What the fuck
do you want?

38:08.111 --> 38:09.635
I mean,
Colombo tells me that

38:09.722 --> 38:12.072
you're no longer interested
in narcotics.

38:12.159 --> 38:14.248
Ask me, that's your--
uh, your lifeblood.

38:14.335 --> 38:16.685
I got a different agenda
right now.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.992
My, uh, partner,

38:19.079 --> 38:23.866
Jose Battle--
he's got a plan to--

38:23.953 --> 38:26.216
to kill Castro.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.262
What's that gotta do
with me?

38:28.349 --> 38:32.222
I hear that the CIA went to you
back in '63

38:32.310 --> 38:34.877
to try to take Castro out.

38:34.964 --> 38:36.662
Battle wants your help.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.578
I mean, it comes
with a huge payday,

38:39.665 --> 38:41.710
and if everything works out
as planned,

38:41.797 --> 38:46.106
you get Havana and all
of your casinos back.

38:46.193 --> 38:49.414
Why are you all of a sudden
brokering political hits?

38:49.501 --> 38:51.720
'Cause I just cut a deal
with the CIA.

38:51.807 --> 38:55.158
They're in with Battle,
so I'm in with them.

38:55.245 --> 38:58.248
Why fight the government
when you can partner with them?

38:58.336 --> 39:00.381
Who's your point man
at the CIA?

39:00.468 --> 39:03.776
"Wild Bill" Harvey.

39:03.863 --> 39:06.213
Bill Harvey?
For real?

39:06.300 --> 39:07.780
What, you know him?

39:07.867 --> 39:09.608
Know him?

39:09.695 --> 39:14.047
I mean, he was the guy.

39:14.134 --> 39:17.703
He was
the-- the puppet master.

39:17.790 --> 39:21.402
He tried to kill Castro
with poisoned wetsuits.

39:21.489 --> 39:24.666
He'd do anything
to whack that guy.

39:24.753 --> 39:28.148
He called it
Operation Mongoose.

39:28.235 --> 39:30.193
Harvey told me that you were
the guy to go to

39:30.280 --> 39:32.935
to get details on
what fucked up the last time,

39:33.022 --> 39:34.720
and how to try to
avoid it on the next.

39:36.417 --> 39:39.072
Alright.

39:39.159 --> 39:40.943
You got a few hours,
I'll lay it on you.

39:41.030 --> 39:42.292
Mm.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.078
But what a goat-fuck.

39:45.165 --> 39:47.994
I got
all the time in the world.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.347
- Adam?
- Mayme.

39:53.434 --> 39:55.218
Uh, pardon my intrusion,

39:55.305 --> 39:58.134
but I wanted to come by
to speak to you in person.

39:58.221 --> 39:59.701
Is, uh, Bumpy here?

39:59.788 --> 40:01.224
No, he stepped out.

40:01.311 --> 40:02.835
Please.
Can I offer you a drink?

40:02.922 --> 40:04.532
No. Uh, thank you.

40:04.619 --> 40:07.100
I wanted to come by personally
to let you know

40:07.187 --> 40:10.669
that your application
has been rejected.

40:10.756 --> 40:12.410
Oh.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.889
Did they say why?

40:13.976 --> 40:15.674
Falsifying records.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.327
It seems that they caught on
to our little scheme.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.938
Well, what does this mean
for us?

40:19.025 --> 40:20.505
A-Are we in trouble?
Am I?

40:20.592 --> 40:22.158
Mayme,
I'm always in trouble.

40:22.245 --> 40:24.378
Oh, God, you do so much good
for our people,

40:24.465 --> 40:25.684
I can't bring you down
like this.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.816
- Mayme--
- I'm so ashamed.

40:27.903 --> 40:29.514
I will never do anything
criminal again,

40:29.601 --> 40:31.820
I swear it,
as God as my witness.

40:31.907 --> 40:33.735
I just-- I pray to Jesus,
"Forgive me."

40:33.822 --> 40:35.215
- Mayme--
- Will you forgive me?

40:35.302 --> 40:37.086
Mayme, I don't think
you understand.

40:37.173 --> 40:39.219
Riverside Refuse
got the contact.

40:39.306 --> 40:41.830
They are run
by the Luccheses.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.006
When they found out that
your bid was going to win,

40:44.093 --> 40:45.443
they used
their corrupt connections

40:45.530 --> 40:48.881
to sabotage
your application.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.057
So it's not because I lied
on the documents?

40:51.144 --> 40:52.362
No.

40:52.450 --> 40:55.540
Some other liars
won this round.

40:55.627 --> 40:57.324
The point is
to keep on fighting.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.021
Yes, Congressman.

40:59.108 --> 41:01.154
I don't like playing dirty
any more than you do,

41:01.241 --> 41:03.199
but the Good Lord knows
what we're up against,

41:03.286 --> 41:07.116
and the Good Lord, and myself,
expect to see you in the office

41:07.203 --> 41:08.596
bright and early
tomorrow morning,

41:08.683 --> 41:12.557
because we have our work
cut out for us.

41:12.644 --> 41:16.038
Yes. We do.

41:16.125 --> 41:17.213
Mm.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.870
Good night, Mayme.

41:21.957 --> 41:23.045
Good night.

41:36.363 --> 41:38.452
What's wrong?

41:38.539 --> 41:40.759
What, you got a date
or something?

41:40.846 --> 41:43.501
You know, you don't have
to stay this late, Stella.

41:43.588 --> 41:46.895
No, I'm, um,
just finishing up some things.

41:46.982 --> 41:48.854
Alright, well,

41:48.941 --> 41:51.334
I'm gonna need you
out of here anyway.

41:51.421 --> 41:54.773
Your father's guy Lombardi's
coming by for a meeting.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.383
Oh? Really?

41:58.690 --> 42:00.039
Okay.

42:33.594 --> 42:36.292
Hey!
Look what the cat dragged in.

42:36.379 --> 42:38.251
Hey, Joe. Stella.

42:38.338 --> 42:41.863
Stella, give us some privacy,
will you?

42:41.950 --> 42:43.473
Have a nice night.

42:48.217 --> 42:51.307
So, how's Chin holding up?

42:57.531 --> 43:00.229
He said to send you this.

43:04.407 --> 43:08.411
Jesus fucking Christ!

43:08.498 --> 43:10.979
He was the one
who killed my husband,

43:11.066 --> 43:12.502
and he was gonna kill you.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.156
Why? Why?
Why would he do that

43:14.243 --> 43:16.158
without Chin's permission?

43:22.077 --> 43:25.428
I want my freedom.

43:39.617 --> 43:41.357
Bravo's arrived.

44:51.689 --> 44:53.516
Clear the room.

44:54.517 --> 44:56.955
Evening, gentlemen.

44:57.042 --> 44:58.260
Bumpy.

44:58.347 --> 44:59.697
On time, to the minute, I see.

44:59.784 --> 45:02.047
Warm in here.

45:02.134 --> 45:03.613
Let's get straight to it.

45:03.701 --> 45:05.137
Were you able to acquire
the information

45:05.224 --> 45:07.400
I requested about
Malcolm's visit to Africa?

45:07.487 --> 45:10.620
About Malcolm X?

45:10.708 --> 45:11.578
Yeah.

45:11.665 --> 45:13.362
Well, I was happy to see

45:13.449 --> 45:16.104
you and he and your daughter
met for lunch.

45:16.191 --> 45:17.758
Yeah, I saw the photograph.

45:17.845 --> 45:20.630
You guys have some real
long-range lenses there.

45:20.718 --> 45:22.067
Well, yeah.

45:22.154 --> 45:24.504
Welcome to working
with the CIA.

45:24.591 --> 45:25.984
We got all the best shit.
Right, Jose?

45:26.071 --> 45:28.116
Yeah, man.
Top notch.

45:28.203 --> 45:29.639
What'd you get?

45:29.727 --> 45:30.945
The question isn't
whether or not

45:31.032 --> 45:32.817
I got information
from Malcolm.

45:32.904 --> 45:36.298
The question is where you
got the audacity to think

45:36.385 --> 45:38.779
that I would fuck over
my friend for cocaine.

45:43.523 --> 45:46.700
You got a real
live wire here, Jose.

45:46.787 --> 45:49.224
He surprises me
all the time.

45:49.311 --> 45:52.793
Yeah, I get it.
I did the research.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.664
You and Malcolm,
you're longtime friends.

45:54.752 --> 45:57.363
The two of you
go way, way back.

45:57.450 --> 45:58.756
We do.

45:58.843 --> 46:01.280
Here's the situation.

46:01.367 --> 46:04.718
I'm gonna get
that Africa information,

46:04.805 --> 46:08.330
one way or, you know,
another way.

46:08.417 --> 46:10.115
Is that so?

46:10.202 --> 46:12.160
I just thought
it would be more pleasant

46:12.247 --> 46:16.774
for Malcolm
and your daughter

46:16.861 --> 46:19.254
to have you be the one
that extracted it.

46:19.341 --> 46:20.778
That's very kind
of you, Bill,

46:20.865 --> 46:24.607
but, uh, I've done
some research, too.

46:24.694 --> 46:26.305
Is that so?

46:26.392 --> 46:28.524
Yeah, about your failed
assassination attempts

46:28.611 --> 46:30.178
against Castro.

46:30.265 --> 46:33.355
Poisoned ice cream,
poisoned wetsuits,

46:33.442 --> 46:35.749
the, uh, exploding cigar.

46:37.185 --> 46:38.708
Think you called it, uh,

46:38.796 --> 46:41.233
Operation Mongoose.

46:43.278 --> 46:45.715
It's a real long game, Johnson.

46:45.803 --> 46:49.154
If I was you,
I'd be very careful.

46:49.241 --> 46:51.547
You even got the Italian mob
to help you,

46:51.634 --> 46:53.723
which would
make headline news

46:53.811 --> 46:56.204
if I were suddenly
to disappear.

46:56.291 --> 46:58.250
See, I got connections
with the press

46:58.337 --> 47:01.209
through my friend
Congressman Adam Clayton Powell.

47:01.296 --> 47:05.083
Let's just say it's
my life insurance policy.

47:05.170 --> 47:06.736
So keep the fuck away
from Malcolm,

47:06.824 --> 47:09.522
and, uh, Jose and I,
we'll sell the cocaine,

47:09.609 --> 47:13.656
you'll get 25%,
and there'll be no fuss.

47:21.751 --> 47:23.405
Secure the material.

47:23.492 --> 47:28.280
Load it into Mr. Johnson's car
when he is ready.

47:30.412 --> 47:32.893
You got some fucking balls,
my man.

47:32.980 --> 47:34.286
You just took me
for a ride.

47:34.373 --> 47:37.463
I'm fucking impressed.

47:37.550 --> 47:38.768
Let's get this shit
out of here.

47:38.856 --> 47:40.422
Junie'll cut it up.

47:40.509 --> 47:42.729
We're taking back Harlem.

48:14.543 --> 48:16.284
Goddamn it.

48:16.371 --> 48:19.461
Who's that fucking spook
think he is?

48:19.548 --> 48:21.028
Does he know
who he's fucking with?

48:21.115 --> 48:24.292
Billy, relax, man.
Don't worry about it.

48:24.379 --> 48:27.948
I get a threat
when I'm expecting intel.

48:28.035 --> 48:29.819
After the speech he gave
in Africa,

48:29.907 --> 48:33.519
Malcolm X is as much of
a fucking communist as Castro.

48:33.606 --> 48:37.175
Bumpy was never going to
betray his friend.

48:37.262 --> 48:39.960
You should've fucking
known that in advance.

48:40.047 --> 48:43.355
However,
I'm close to Bumpy.

48:43.442 --> 48:46.314
He's close to Malcolm X.

48:46.401 --> 48:48.273
I'm listening.

48:48.360 --> 48:50.492
