WEBVTT

02:00.897 --> 02:02.599
Thanks for waiting.

02:08.303 --> 02:09.804
You can't blame me!

02:09.806 --> 02:11.306
Wade!

02:15.478 --> 02:16.846
What else
can I say, Wade?

02:18.347 --> 02:20.750
- Just give me some space.
- I'm sorry.

02:23.285 --> 02:24.885
Where you headed, guys?

02:28.958 --> 02:32.225
The M1's chockas,
so we'll double back on Airport Drive.

02:32.227 --> 02:34.229
Get you there just as quick.

02:37.634 --> 02:40.703
Here we are.
16.40, thanks.

02:42.270 --> 02:44.437
Stay here,
I'll get the camper.

02:44.439 --> 02:46.339
Right.

02:46.341 --> 02:49.912
- Thank you, keep the change.
- Cheers, mate.

02:54.984 --> 02:57.551
Your mate
doesn't seem too happy.

02:57.553 --> 03:00.955
- I upset him.
- Well, go on, cheer him up.

03:00.957 --> 03:02.692
Life's too short to mope around.

03:03.693 --> 03:05.460
Thank you.

03:28.584 --> 03:30.951
<i>And take care
of refilling with your washer fluid,</i>

03:30.953 --> 03:34.287
<i>as it contains methanol,
and is toxic to the human body.</i>

03:34.289 --> 03:35.491
<i>When traveling
long distances...</i>

03:47.302 --> 03:48.936
Wrong side.

03:48.938 --> 03:50.305
Right.

03:54.977 --> 03:56.913
You didn't get a GPS?

03:58.514 --> 04:00.881
- Got one.
- You're joking.

04:00.883 --> 04:03.517
Downloaded the maps back home.

04:03.519 --> 04:06.589
<i>Starting route
to Copacabana Beach.</i>

04:11.594 --> 04:13.663
You should put the ring
somewhere safe.

04:15.932 --> 04:16.933
What's the point?

04:19.401 --> 04:21.269
I designed it for you,
and you didn't even look at it.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.013
Shit.

04:33.448 --> 04:34.849
Wrong side.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.511
No, that's not what I want.

05:02.879 --> 05:04.279
Stop!

05:06.082 --> 05:08.516
Everything's backwards.

05:08.518 --> 05:11.118
This is so confusing.

05:11.120 --> 05:13.523
Come on. No, no, no, no.

05:19.128 --> 05:20.594
To Harbour Bridge,
up here.

05:20.596 --> 05:21.796
- That way?
- Yeah.

05:27.069 --> 05:28.403
There it is.

05:33.408 --> 05:35.609
Smile, you're in my video.

05:35.611 --> 05:36.911
I didn't ask to be
in your video.

05:36.913 --> 05:39.814
Come on.

05:39.816 --> 05:42.550
Are you excited?
I'm excited.

05:42.552 --> 05:45.853
This is meant to be amazing.
Oh, my goodness!

05:45.855 --> 05:47.521
Will you put the phone
down for a second?

05:47.523 --> 05:49.757
- I wanna film it.
- No, you need to put it down

05:49.759 --> 05:52.827
so I can use
the rearview mirror.

05:52.829 --> 05:54.460
That is amazing.

05:54.462 --> 05:56.429
I didn't think
it was going to be so big!

05:56.431 --> 05:58.599
- What'd you expect?
- I don't know.

05:58.601 --> 05:59.867
Well, which way
is the Opera House?

05:59.869 --> 06:01.602
I don't know.
Down there, I think.

06:01.604 --> 06:03.671
Is that it over there?
I can't even see it.

06:03.673 --> 06:05.973
I don't know, I'm driving,
I can't see it either.

06:05.975 --> 06:07.440
You can see it
on the way back.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.710
Wade, I wanna see it now.
I can't see it.

06:09.712 --> 06:11.781
I can't... I don't even know
how to get down there.

06:14.416 --> 06:17.084
- There you go.
- Cool!

06:19.522 --> 06:20.690
I can't really see it.

06:22.024 --> 06:23.423
Come on!

06:23.425 --> 06:25.661
There's your Opera House.

06:27.763 --> 06:30.463
Wade, come on!
Look at this place.

06:30.465 --> 06:32.802
- Come on, come here.
- Yeah.

06:34.503 --> 06:36.572
Let's get a picture,
come on.

06:37.940 --> 06:40.741
At least pretend
you're having fun.

06:40.743 --> 06:43.646
- Say cheese!
- Cheese.

07:25.087 --> 07:28.956
Hey, did you know there are
55 different species

07:28.958 --> 07:32.526
of kangaroos and wallabies
in Australia?

07:32.528 --> 07:34.261
Fifty-four more
than I ever imagined.

07:34.263 --> 07:38.899
Yeah, and 21 out of the 25
of the world's deadliest snakes

07:38.901 --> 07:40.901
call Australia home.

07:40.903 --> 07:42.603
Hm, comforting.

07:42.605 --> 07:45.673
The deadliest being
the black-headed taipan.

07:45.675 --> 07:48.609
And they're attracted to fear.

07:48.611 --> 07:52.079
Didn't the Crocodile Hunter get killed
by a stingray or something down here?

07:52.081 --> 07:55.017
Welcome to Australia:
a giant death trap.

08:01.991 --> 08:03.492
It's breathtaking.

08:04.293 --> 08:06.095
Oh, I love this place.

08:07.663 --> 08:09.997
- There's no one out there.
- Even better.

08:09.999 --> 08:11.767
We've got it all to ourselves.

08:13.903 --> 08:14.904
Right.

08:16.238 --> 08:18.672
This is Lisa Sachs,
reporting live

08:18.674 --> 08:20.107
from Copacabana Beach.

08:20.109 --> 08:22.943
With me is my co-host,
Wade Kelly,

08:22.945 --> 08:25.145
and the two of us
are about to go

08:25.147 --> 08:28.215
for our first swim
in Australia!

08:28.217 --> 08:29.717
Whoo!

08:29.719 --> 08:31.085
I'm good.

08:31.087 --> 08:34.587
Are you serious?
We came all this way.

08:34.590 --> 08:37.758
Yeah, and we're here.
It's nice.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.830
You may never have
this opportunity again.

08:42.865 --> 08:46.736
Come on! Where's
your sense of adventure?

08:49.905 --> 08:52.241
We got two weeks together.

08:56.746 --> 08:59.882
Then what? Hm?

09:01.751 --> 09:04.620
Well, let's just make
the most of this vacation.

09:55.404 --> 09:57.271
- Wade?
- Fuck!

09:59.375 --> 10:01.842
- What happened?
- Got stung by a jellyfish or something.

10:01.844 --> 10:03.944
Get out of the water!

10:03.946 --> 10:05.979
There's jellyfish everywhere!

10:05.981 --> 10:08.215
Ow! God...

10:08.217 --> 10:11.018
Oh, my God, Wade?

10:11.020 --> 10:13.055
- It kills.
- Oh... Goddammit!

10:19.128 --> 10:21.829
Sore?

10:21.831 --> 10:24.164
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

10:24.166 --> 10:25.833
It's looks nasty.

10:25.835 --> 10:27.301
You're gonna have
to pee on it.

10:27.303 --> 10:28.836
What?

10:28.838 --> 10:30.070
You're gonna have
to pee on it.

10:30.072 --> 10:31.738
No way, that's disgusting.

10:31.740 --> 10:33.309
Just go down in the sand,
no one will see it.

10:34.844 --> 10:36.810
No. You're gonna
have to do that yourself.

10:36.812 --> 10:37.880
I can't do that.

10:39.248 --> 10:41.350
They really need to warn
tourists about this.

10:42.985 --> 10:45.121
That's me done swimming.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.029
We should go to Ayers Rock.

10:56.031 --> 10:59.433
Apparently,
it's called Uluru here.

10:59.435 --> 11:01.935
- Don't start this.
- Listen to me.

11:01.937 --> 11:04.037
We got the coast back home.

11:04.039 --> 11:06.039
Not the Australian coast.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.976
I know, but at least
our beaches are safe to swim at

11:08.978 --> 11:11.145
and it's not
some death trap.

11:11.147 --> 11:12.882
I've mapped it all out.

11:14.183 --> 11:16.886
- Every stop.
- Screw the map.

11:18.287 --> 11:20.754
Look, they've got
this really cool place,

11:20.756 --> 11:23.090
"Sculptures in the Desert,"

11:23.092 --> 11:27.394
and they've got these rocks
that are carved into artwork.

11:27.396 --> 11:28.862
Yeah.

11:28.864 --> 11:31.064
And there's lots
of cool stuff on the way:

11:31.066 --> 11:34.868
big banana, big pineapple,
big windmill.

11:34.870 --> 11:36.403
Big deal.

11:36.405 --> 11:40.274
And there's a <i>Mad Max</i> museum.
You love those movies.

11:40.276 --> 11:44.077
Only the first
and the last one. No.

11:44.079 --> 11:46.446
If you've seen one beach,
you seen them all.

11:46.448 --> 11:48.951
There's only one Outback.

11:50.352 --> 11:53.722
What do you say?
Don't say no.

12:05.234 --> 12:07.467
My brain thinks is 2:00 p.m.

12:07.469 --> 12:09.770
How's your leg, babe?

12:11.440 --> 12:15.776
Have ever had boiling water
poured all over your thigh?

12:15.778 --> 12:19.413
- Do you want me to drive?
- It's okay.

12:19.415 --> 12:21.850
- Are you hungry?
- We'll get food on the way.

12:26.922 --> 12:29.490
<i>Starting route
to Ayers Rock/Uluru.</i>

12:29.492 --> 12:31.358
Whoa. Thirty-two hours?

12:31.360 --> 12:35.195
- <i>Head east on Beach...</i>
- Let the adventure begin.

13:22.144 --> 13:25.245
I turned on roaming,
but there's no service out here.

13:25.247 --> 13:27.414
- No shit.
- But what about the maps on your phone?

13:27.416 --> 13:31.084
That runs on GPS,
not cell service.

13:31.086 --> 13:32.487
Do you think it's safe

13:32.489 --> 13:35.155
to be out in the middle
of nowhere with no service?

13:35.157 --> 13:37.558
Where's your sense
of adventure now?

13:37.560 --> 13:40.360
We're not going off map,
we'll stay on established roads.

13:40.362 --> 13:43.030
There's lots of small towns
along the way.

13:43.032 --> 13:44.131
They'll have phone service.

13:44.133 --> 13:46.302
I know, but still.

13:48.070 --> 13:49.872
This was your idea.

14:12.061 --> 14:14.562
Hey, do you think
we should get extra?

14:14.564 --> 14:15.898
You know,
just to be safe?

14:16.899 --> 14:19.299
Whatever you want.

14:19.301 --> 14:21.134
Okay.

14:21.136 --> 14:23.573
I'm gonna see
what they've got to drink.

14:31.481 --> 14:34.484
Hi. Do you have
any gas cans?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.189
How cute is this?

14:44.126 --> 14:46.563
Yeah.

14:58.340 --> 15:01.476
- You all right?
- Great, thank you.

15:01.478 --> 15:06.246
- No, your leg.
- Oh, I got stung by a jellyfish.

15:06.248 --> 15:09.116
- Welcome to Australia, partner.
- Thank you very much, sir.

15:09.118 --> 15:12.085
That your missus
that just came through?

15:12.087 --> 15:13.353
Yeah, that's my girlfriend.

15:13.355 --> 15:15.322
Hey, is this stuff any good?

15:15.324 --> 15:17.558
I never had any, it's just
for the tourists, mate.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.195
I'll get that as
well, and whatever Lisa grabbed.

15:21.196 --> 15:25.267
77.16 for everything.

15:27.035 --> 15:29.905
- Your bills are so beautiful.
- Right.

15:31.240 --> 15:34.141
- Where you yanks headed?
- The Outback.

15:34.143 --> 15:36.711
- Just everywhere, right?
- Right.

15:36.713 --> 15:39.212
- Uh, Ayers Rock.
- Uluru.

15:39.214 --> 15:41.116
Yeah, we hear
it's beautiful as well.

15:45.053 --> 15:46.556
There's a price to beauty,
though, isn't there?

15:48.525 --> 15:50.693
Don't need to tell you that, though.

15:52.161 --> 15:53.429
Thank you.

16:31.734 --> 16:34.269
- You okay?
- Just tired.

16:45.347 --> 16:48.016
Can't we just go back
to the way we've been?

16:50.185 --> 16:51.621
Forget about the flight over?

16:55.592 --> 16:58.091
It's different now.

16:58.093 --> 16:59.461
But I'm still here.

17:00.462 --> 17:01.596
We're still here.

17:01.598 --> 17:03.398
For how long?

17:07.569 --> 17:09.569
What more can I do for you?

17:09.571 --> 17:11.672
It's not just about you, Wade.

17:11.674 --> 17:14.541
Do you know what the flight
attendant said to me...

17:14.544 --> 17:15.744
when I moved seats?

17:18.313 --> 17:20.449
She said I deserve better.

17:22.451 --> 17:24.585
I can't keep
changing myself for you.

17:24.587 --> 17:26.118
Of course not.

17:26.121 --> 17:29.757
Why would I matter?
Why would we matter?

17:29.759 --> 17:31.561
It's always about you.

18:05.360 --> 18:09.697
Oh, was that a dead kangaroo?

18:09.699 --> 18:11.231
Affirmative.

18:11.233 --> 18:13.166
Oh, that's tragic.

18:13.168 --> 18:15.368
They're no different
than deer back home.

18:15.370 --> 18:17.437
Dead deer are no less tragic.

18:17.439 --> 18:19.574
It's all subjective.

18:19.576 --> 18:22.342
What? You squish insects
every single day.

18:22.344 --> 18:25.245
If you pull back far enough;
kangaroos, deer,

18:25.247 --> 18:27.548
- they look like insects.
- Really?

18:27.550 --> 18:30.383
Well, what about people then?
You and me?

18:30.385 --> 18:33.386
Same. We're nothing
but specks on the planet

18:33.388 --> 18:35.123
that's a speck in the universe.

18:37.493 --> 18:39.359
Deep.

18:39.361 --> 18:41.798
Doesn't make the dead
kangaroo any less sad.

18:47.770 --> 18:50.740
Yeah. Whatever
you say, boss.

19:33.850 --> 19:38.521
<i>In 500 meters,
turn right onto Major's Road.</i>

19:49.464 --> 19:51.431
<i>Proceed to the route.</i>

19:51.433 --> 19:52.669
Dirt road from here.

19:53.670 --> 19:56.304
Drive carefully.

20:32.407 --> 20:34.844
<i>Turn right onto
Cattle Run Road.</i>

20:39.749 --> 20:44.685
<i>In 150 meters, make a U-turn
and return to Major's Road.</i>

20:44.687 --> 20:47.922
Wade, why is it saying that?
Pull over.

20:47.924 --> 20:49.324
I am, okay?

20:55.898 --> 20:58.866
<i>Starting route
to Ayers Rock/Uluru.</i>

20:58.868 --> 21:01.301
What? How are we
doing on gas?

21:01.303 --> 21:02.970
- <i>Continue on Cattle Run Road.</i>
- Fine.

21:02.972 --> 21:05.775
We've got over half a tank,
plus the can.

21:07.844 --> 21:10.811
Oh, I don't like this.

21:10.813 --> 21:12.580
These things
reroute all the time,

21:12.582 --> 21:14.048
faster ways or something.

21:14.050 --> 21:16.751
They take into account
road works and traffic.

21:16.753 --> 21:19.687
Even if they're not
connected to service?

21:19.689 --> 21:23.023
Maybe we should head back.

21:23.025 --> 21:24.392
Are you joking?

21:25.393 --> 21:26.894
We've been driving for hours.

21:26.896 --> 21:28.996
Yeah, in the wrong direction.

21:28.998 --> 21:30.731
What happens if we get lost?

21:30.733 --> 21:34.101
We're not gonna get lost.
We have more than enough gas,

21:34.103 --> 21:36.103
we have GPS,
and we're on a road.

21:36.105 --> 21:37.772
A dirt road.

21:37.774 --> 21:39.640
Yeah, it means
we're going somewhere.

21:39.642 --> 21:41.542
You know how stupid
you sound, right?

21:41.544 --> 21:45.012
Would you just trust me
for once in your life?

21:45.014 --> 21:48.682
Okay. You got the wheel,
Einstein.

22:16.813 --> 22:20.817
<i>In 200 meters, turn right
onto Dry Creek Crossing.</i>

22:32.995 --> 22:36.564
<i>Make a U-turn and continue
on Cattle Run Road.</i>

22:36.566 --> 22:37.867
Perfect.

22:46.576 --> 22:48.611
<i>Proceed to the route.</i>

23:03.559 --> 23:04.961
Don't do this again.

23:06.662 --> 23:09.597
<i>Starting route
to Ayers Rock/Uluru.</i>

23:09.599 --> 23:12.034
<i>Head north on Cattle Run Road.</i>

23:26.682 --> 23:29.151
"You've got the wheel,
Einstein."

23:36.092 --> 23:37.493
Oh, God!

23:38.861 --> 23:40.529
Oh, sweet Jesus.

23:42.698 --> 23:44.000
Fuck off!

23:45.167 --> 23:46.903
What the hell
are you doing out there?

23:48.704 --> 23:51.872
- There's a snake.
- Get back in the car.

23:51.874 --> 23:53.075
I had to pee.

23:55.611 --> 23:58.848
- Was it big?
- Enormous.

24:00.116 --> 24:02.450
The snake was, too.

24:06.022 --> 24:07.823
Where are we?

24:09.191 --> 24:11.992
The Outback.

24:11.994 --> 24:14.028
We came to a fork in the road
a ways back,

24:14.030 --> 24:17.131
and the GPS
wasn't being cooperative.

24:17.133 --> 24:19.500
Cooperative?

24:19.502 --> 24:21.068
Why didn't you wake me?

24:21.070 --> 24:22.870
You were sleeping, so...

24:22.872 --> 24:24.740
That's not an answer.

24:26.108 --> 24:28.108
We're stranded
and alone out here

24:28.110 --> 24:29.512
in the middle of nowhere.

24:30.780 --> 24:32.581
We're not stranded and alone.

24:34.917 --> 24:37.918
I'm here. You're here.

24:37.920 --> 24:39.488
We're together.

24:40.289 --> 24:42.925
Yeah, for the moment.

24:50.099 --> 24:52.702
It's about going away,
isn't it?

24:56.272 --> 24:58.038
It's a big commitment.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.908
You're not even done
with your basic training yet.

25:00.910 --> 25:03.546
You knew this was coming.
You're the one who suggested it.

25:08.250 --> 25:10.786
I don't want to be
an Army wife.

25:12.188 --> 25:13.889
I'm not gonna be
in the Army forever.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.190
Four years max.

25:16.192 --> 25:19.026
Four years
is a long time.

25:19.028 --> 25:22.196
And long distance relationships
are tough, Wade.

25:22.198 --> 25:23.797
Uh-huh.

25:23.799 --> 25:27.101
You know, we never had
a proper relationship.

25:27.103 --> 25:29.336
It has always been
about what happened.

25:29.338 --> 25:31.205
Your mom would want this.

25:31.207 --> 25:33.574
Let's get goddamn married,
have two screaming kids,

25:33.576 --> 25:35.576
buy a house,
the whole shebang.

25:35.578 --> 25:36.910
You can't keep
saying you love me

25:36.912 --> 25:39.179
if you don't wanna
get married.

25:39.181 --> 25:42.084
That's ridiculous,
and you know it.

25:43.986 --> 25:45.652
I do love you.

25:45.654 --> 25:48.989
I'm just not sure
we should get married yet.

25:48.991 --> 25:51.959
I'd do anything for you.
I'd lay down and die for you.

25:51.961 --> 25:53.961
I'd do the same, Wade.

25:53.963 --> 25:56.263
That doesn't mean we should
get married right now.

25:56.265 --> 25:58.065
You know, I don't...

25:58.067 --> 26:00.300
I don't even know what
I wanna do with my life.

26:00.302 --> 26:04.204
I need to focus on me
before I can focus on us.

26:04.206 --> 26:06.842
Goddamn circles.

26:14.116 --> 26:17.184
So are we just gonna keep
going this way

26:17.186 --> 26:19.021
'til we run
out of gas or...

26:20.656 --> 26:22.656
We're not gonna
run out of gas.

26:22.658 --> 26:25.094
We will eventually if we
don't come up with a plan.

26:29.899 --> 26:32.666
We'll climb up that ridge.
We see something up there,

26:32.668 --> 26:35.235
we'll drive towards it,
be back in an hour.

26:35.237 --> 26:37.940
- And if we don't?
- We'll go back the way we came.

26:41.077 --> 26:43.243
All right, well,
can we drive up there?

26:43.245 --> 26:45.712
I wouldn't risk
taking this thing off-road.

26:45.714 --> 26:47.181
It's safer if we walk.

26:47.183 --> 26:49.650
Okay, well,
maybe I should go along.

26:49.652 --> 26:51.085
You know, your leg.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.887
My leg's fine,
I've got two of them.

26:53.889 --> 26:56.390
Really, Wade,
I can do this on my own.

26:56.392 --> 26:59.862
We're not separating,
we're staying together.

27:25.287 --> 27:29.456
Okay, three guesses:
what's fairy floss?

27:29.458 --> 27:34.094
- Um... dental floss.
- Nope.

27:34.096 --> 27:36.763
Thread?

27:36.765 --> 27:39.399
One more.

27:39.401 --> 27:42.703
I don't know.
Give me a hint.

27:42.705 --> 27:45.005
You eat it.

27:45.007 --> 27:47.174
Spaghetti.

27:47.176 --> 27:49.276
Cotton candy.

27:49.278 --> 27:51.479
Oh, right, okay.

27:51.481 --> 27:53.349
My turn.

27:54.450 --> 27:58.252
Okay. "Boob tube."

27:58.254 --> 28:00.488
Well, that's easy.
A television set.

28:00.490 --> 28:02.723
Not even close.

28:02.725 --> 28:05.828
What? I...

28:07.029 --> 28:09.965
- Does it involve boobs?
- It does.

28:12.502 --> 28:15.804
- Tube top.
- That's it.

28:17.507 --> 28:20.676
You better not tell anyone
I like watching the boob tube.

28:24.880 --> 28:28.384
- How much further?
- Not far now.

28:33.022 --> 28:35.090
You got
any more granola bars?

28:37.226 --> 28:39.061
Last one.

28:40.296 --> 28:43.065
- I'll split it with you.
- Okay.

28:55.878 --> 28:58.178
Wade, we should head back.

28:58.180 --> 29:00.182
I don't wanna get
stuck out here in the dark.

29:02.384 --> 29:04.086
It's just up there.

29:05.788 --> 29:08.523
We're running out of water.

29:08.525 --> 29:11.293
It's all yours,
I've had enough.

29:13.829 --> 29:15.295
We'll get up the ridge,

29:15.297 --> 29:18.332
have a look
and then we'll head back.

29:18.334 --> 29:20.102
It'll be easier going down.

29:30.312 --> 29:33.447
What are they, Wade?
Dingoes?

29:33.449 --> 29:35.015
I don't know.

29:35.017 --> 29:37.453
If you keep moving
they won't hurt you.

29:45.595 --> 29:48.297
Nothing. No signal.

29:50.065 --> 29:51.999
There has to be something.

29:52.001 --> 29:55.603
We hiked all this way
for nothing.

29:55.605 --> 29:59.942
Not for nothing.
Look at this.

30:02.579 --> 30:06.046
Let's get back to the camper,
get some rest,

30:06.048 --> 30:08.348
and drive back
the way we came.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.185
Give me your phone.

30:12.121 --> 30:13.122
Come here.

30:14.923 --> 30:18.158
Can you see the car?

30:18.160 --> 30:19.228
No.

30:21.130 --> 30:23.130
It's over that way.

30:23.132 --> 30:25.467
Okay, well, let's go.

30:28.337 --> 30:29.905
Come on.

30:48.591 --> 30:50.259
It's not far now.

30:51.594 --> 30:53.329
You've been
saying that for ages.

30:55.164 --> 30:59.600
Yeah, it took ages to walk up
here, so we're close.

30:59.602 --> 31:03.405
- I'm cold, Wade.
- Yeah, I am, too.

31:07.076 --> 31:08.609
This isn't the way we came.

31:08.611 --> 31:11.311
- Yeah, it is.
- How can you tell?

31:11.313 --> 31:13.015
Everything looks
the same out here.

31:14.149 --> 31:16.917
We came over the ridge,

31:16.919 --> 31:19.487
past the old dead tree.

31:19.489 --> 31:21.622
It's the same path.

31:21.624 --> 31:24.358
No. We haven't passed
the old tree,

31:24.360 --> 31:26.026
that was on the way up.

31:26.028 --> 31:28.161
Yeah, we have,
like an hour ago.

31:28.163 --> 31:31.298
It was by all
those white rocks.

31:31.300 --> 31:35.003
No, we've only passed the white rocks
once, on the way up.

31:37.172 --> 31:39.373
Just chill out.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.276
We're goin' the right way,
I just know.

31:43.212 --> 31:45.613
Oh, you just know.

31:45.615 --> 31:49.249
Great, Wade, that makes me
feel much better.

31:49.251 --> 31:51.887
This way,
I'm sure of it.

31:53.021 --> 31:54.591
Of course.

32:01.463 --> 32:06.299
Wade, it's different terrain.

32:06.301 --> 32:08.034
- Wade...
- Don't be ridiculous.

32:08.036 --> 32:10.036
You're going the wrong way.
You're not listening to me.

32:10.038 --> 32:12.339
We're not going the wrong way.
This is the way we go!

32:12.341 --> 32:14.174
What do you wanna do?
Do you wanna stay here?

32:14.176 --> 32:16.744
- The car's that way.
- We're going the wrong way...

32:16.746 --> 32:18.515
It'll be fine, come on.

32:24.621 --> 32:26.989
You need to stop and rest.

32:28.157 --> 32:30.926
Yeah, yeah, I know.
I just thought...

32:34.396 --> 32:35.763
I just thought
if we...

32:35.765 --> 32:37.431
You need to save your energy.

32:37.433 --> 32:40.167
I just thought if we use...

32:45.575 --> 32:48.645
- This is bad.
- It's not good.

32:50.078 --> 32:53.415
- This is bad.
- Drink this.

32:55.117 --> 32:56.985
It's for you.

32:58.053 --> 32:59.988
Finish your water.

33:16.673 --> 33:19.239
We'll get some rest
and then...

33:19.241 --> 33:21.776
in the morning
we'll find the camper.

33:21.778 --> 33:24.413
Yeah, yeah.

33:59.114 --> 34:00.648
What time is it?

34:00.650 --> 34:02.717
Come on, it's time
to find the car.

34:02.719 --> 34:06.723
My leg.

34:09.859 --> 34:11.458
Can you walk?

34:11.460 --> 34:15.395
Yeah.

34:15.397 --> 34:17.132
- Yeah.
- Okay.

34:26.174 --> 34:30.610
Holy shit, Wade,
that's really bad.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.313
No, no, no, no, no.

34:33.315 --> 34:35.148
I gotta get
to a doctor.

34:36.753 --> 34:39.152
Pull your pants up,
you should keep it covered,

34:39.154 --> 34:40.455
you don't want it
to get worse.

34:46.128 --> 34:47.527
You recognize anything?

34:47.530 --> 34:51.065
No, it all looks the same.

34:54.670 --> 34:58.539
We should head north.
We walked up the ridge.

34:58.541 --> 35:01.542
The sun was setting
there, right?

35:03.145 --> 35:04.814
That would mean
we should head south, then.

35:06.583 --> 35:09.217
Yeah. Yeah, south.

35:12.387 --> 35:14.824
Let's go,
I'm thirsty.

35:40.415 --> 35:42.184
This all kangaroo shit?

35:43.185 --> 35:44.417
I don't know.

35:44.419 --> 35:46.589
I'm not an expert
on animal poop.

36:07.944 --> 36:10.580
How do you even know we're
heading in the right direction?

36:13.983 --> 36:16.619
If we keep moving...

36:18.453 --> 36:19.689
we'll find something.

36:22.290 --> 36:24.159
I need water, Wade.

36:24.961 --> 36:28.665
Like now. So do you.

36:31.400 --> 36:32.867
What do you suggest?

36:32.869 --> 36:35.603
Huh?

36:35.605 --> 36:38.473
Stop and wait
for somebody?

36:43.412 --> 36:46.649
You sit, you die.

36:50.452 --> 36:53.721
I don't know how much longer
I can keep walking like this.

36:53.723 --> 36:56.191
We'll be fine.

36:58.695 --> 37:00.530
Not without water.

37:02.932 --> 37:06.901
You know, if it comes to it,
we can always drink...

37:06.903 --> 37:09.806
You know, 9/11?

37:11.774 --> 37:13.574
People were trapped.

37:13.576 --> 37:16.342
This one guy drank
contaminated water

37:16.344 --> 37:18.479
and collected his urine
for his daughter.

37:18.481 --> 37:20.413
It killed him.

37:20.415 --> 37:23.984
But it kept her alive
long enough to be rescued.

37:23.986 --> 37:28.455
- I would never drink urine.
- You won't have to.

37:28.457 --> 37:31.226
I'd rather be dehydrated.

37:34.063 --> 37:37.967
Don't worry, we'll be fine.

37:40.570 --> 37:43.506
- We'll be fine.
- Stop saying that.

37:44.874 --> 37:47.510
What is two times six?

37:51.446 --> 37:53.248
Thirty-two.

37:58.386 --> 38:00.823
Four threes?

38:06.629 --> 38:08.231
Nineteen.

38:11.033 --> 38:12.802
That's wrong.

38:13.803 --> 38:16.103
What?

38:16.105 --> 38:18.541
Nineteen was wrong.

38:19.742 --> 38:21.776
It's not it.

38:21.778 --> 38:23.780
What's not it?

38:25.447 --> 38:26.983
What's not it?

38:30.620 --> 38:33.621
You need to stop walking.

38:33.623 --> 38:35.388
You need to rest.

38:35.390 --> 38:38.594
No, no, no.
I'm good.

38:39.929 --> 38:42.563
- We're good.
- You need to stop.

38:42.565 --> 38:45.001
Regain our strength.

39:01.884 --> 39:03.653
What now?

39:10.092 --> 39:11.994
I don't know.

39:13.996 --> 39:19.502
If we get out of here...
will you still marry me?

39:21.871 --> 39:23.773
Yeah.

41:06.575 --> 41:08.744
Lisa, you up?

41:10.179 --> 41:12.014
You awake?

41:20.990 --> 41:24.694
Come on.
Let's go.

41:28.130 --> 41:30.698
Lisa...

41:30.700 --> 41:31.934
Hey...

41:34.070 --> 41:37.604
Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey,
come on, Lisa.

41:37.606 --> 41:39.273
Lisa, Lisa, hey,
come on, baby.

41:39.275 --> 41:41.842
Hey! Come on, wake up.

41:41.844 --> 41:44.578
Hey, hey, hey, come on.
Come on!

41:44.580 --> 41:47.614
Lisa!
Lisa, wake up!

41:47.616 --> 41:50.284
Lisa, come on!
Come on!

41:50.286 --> 41:53.956
Help! Help!

41:55.758 --> 41:57.291
Hey...

41:57.293 --> 41:58.759
Come on, come on, up, up.

41:58.761 --> 42:00.661
Come on, baby.
Come on, wake up.

42:00.663 --> 42:04.331
Okay, come on.
Come on, baby.

42:04.333 --> 42:06.102
Come on, come on.

42:11.707 --> 42:13.275
Help!

42:14.643 --> 42:17.980
Help! Help!

42:19.715 --> 42:22.752
Help! Help!

42:23.753 --> 42:25.619
Please wake up!

42:25.621 --> 42:28.122
Ah, Lisa. Help!

42:28.124 --> 42:30.991
Oh, please...
Oh, please...

42:30.993 --> 42:32.126
Please, wake up.

42:43.005 --> 42:44.707
I got you.

43:14.203 --> 43:18.574
I'm gonna get you home.
I'm gonna get you home.

43:28.117 --> 43:29.983
Come on.

43:29.985 --> 43:31.620
Come on!

44:12.461 --> 44:13.829
Hey!

44:52.368 --> 44:53.869
Okay.

45:28.204 --> 45:32.007
Water... water...

45:40.015 --> 45:41.984
Lisa, stay here.

45:43.385 --> 45:45.154
I'm coming back.

45:48.857 --> 45:51.293
I'm coming back.

46:17.152 --> 46:18.454
Wade...

46:26.929 --> 46:28.897
Wade, where are you?

46:40.442 --> 46:42.378
Oh, my God!

48:43.332 --> 48:44.667
Wade...

48:46.301 --> 48:47.537
Wade.

48:50.540 --> 48:51.974
Wade.

49:15.063 --> 49:17.500
I'm coming for you.

49:29.378 --> 49:34.183
Lisa! Lisa! Lisa!

49:35.417 --> 49:38.686
<i>Lisa... Lisa...</i>

49:38.688 --> 49:41.323
Wade!

49:53.168 --> 49:55.402
Lisa!

49:55.404 --> 49:58.205
No, no, no.

49:58.207 --> 50:01.041
Where'd you go?

50:01.043 --> 50:02.142
Oh, where'd you go?

50:02.144 --> 50:04.379
<i>Lisa!</i>

50:05.380 --> 50:07.416
Oh, my God, Wade.

50:18.495 --> 50:20.093
Where did you go?

50:35.277 --> 50:37.547
Just a speck.

50:42.451 --> 50:45.087
I shouldn't have left you.

50:51.426 --> 50:52.695
You idiot.

50:55.230 --> 50:57.667
<i>Oh, you idiot.</i>

53:45.267 --> 53:47.302
<i>Where are you?</i>

54:10.660 --> 54:12.895
Yes, thank God.
Oh, God.

55:01.077 --> 55:02.410
Why won't you start?

56:11.647 --> 56:15.551
Liquid... liquid...

56:35.605 --> 56:36.639
The straw.

57:52.882 --> 57:56.786
Lisa! I got water for you!

58:34.557 --> 58:36.559
I don't know what to say.

58:42.798 --> 58:45.768
I don't know
who's gonna find this.

58:47.703 --> 58:50.139
Or if anybody's gonna find this.

58:56.579 --> 58:58.614
<i>If you are
watching this...</i>

59:00.649 --> 59:01.884
<i>Stop.</i>

59:04.120 --> 59:06.022
<i>Stop watching.</i>

59:07.590 --> 59:10.659
Go and find
your boyfriend...

59:11.794 --> 59:13.195
girlfriend...

59:14.196 --> 59:18.534
husband, wife, kids...

59:20.669 --> 59:22.605
and just hold them.

59:25.174 --> 59:27.143
<i>Tell 'em you love them.</i>

59:29.345 --> 59:31.213
<i>Because...</i>

59:33.849 --> 59:37.653
you can be in the most
beautiful place on earth and...

59:39.155 --> 59:41.791
it all means nothing
if you're alone.

01:00:00.276 --> 01:00:02.111
Wade?

01:00:04.814 --> 01:00:06.682
If you're watching...

01:00:12.121 --> 01:00:14.156
<i>Sorry I haven't been...</i>

01:00:15.724 --> 01:00:17.626
<i>the easiest girlfriend.</i>

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:28.204
Thank you for being
so kind...

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.141
<i>and loving.</i>

01:00:37.813 --> 01:00:40.249
<i>Thank you for being there
when my mom died.</i>

01:00:46.856 --> 01:00:49.291
I couldn't have
done that without you.

01:01:03.038 --> 01:01:04.740
I miss you.

01:03:01.957 --> 01:03:03.125
Wade?

01:04:01.283 --> 01:04:02.384
Wade.

01:04:09.358 --> 01:04:10.457
Wade.

01:04:11.994 --> 01:04:13.996
Wade, Wade.

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:17.297
Are you okay, Wade?

01:04:17.299 --> 01:04:18.967
Wade, Wade.

01:04:20.936 --> 01:04:22.369
Are you okay?

01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:23.571
Are you okay?

01:04:23.573 --> 01:04:26.041
Are you okay?

01:04:27.577 --> 01:04:29.644
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:04:29.646 --> 01:04:32.948
- You're okay? You're okay.
- I'm okay.

01:04:35.317 --> 01:04:37.986
I thought
I'd never see you again.

01:04:41.924 --> 01:04:43.593
How did this happen?

01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:48.565
I don't know.

01:04:54.002 --> 01:04:56.002
I found the car.

01:04:56.004 --> 01:04:58.440
Is it close?

01:05:03.546 --> 01:05:06.346
I'm sorry,
it's all my fault.

01:05:06.348 --> 01:05:08.350
It's okay. We can go
to the car together.

01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:13.389
It won't start.
The battery...

01:05:14.390 --> 01:05:16.358
The battery's dead.

01:05:20.429 --> 01:05:24.632
I left...
I left the lights on.

01:05:24.634 --> 01:05:27.735
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:05:27.737 --> 01:05:29.572
We don't need the car.

01:05:31.173 --> 01:05:32.339
We don't need it.

01:05:32.341 --> 01:05:34.042
I got you.

01:05:35.277 --> 01:05:37.578
You...

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.348
You gotta follow my line.

01:05:44.119 --> 01:05:46.955
You gotta follow
my line to the car.

01:05:48.190 --> 01:05:50.392
- Someone will find you.
- What?

01:05:54.463 --> 01:05:55.630
What are you talking about?

01:05:55.632 --> 01:05:57.567
You gotta get to the car.

01:06:03.105 --> 01:06:04.106
What is it?

01:06:05.107 --> 01:06:06.476
What is that?

01:06:07.544 --> 01:06:09.242
It's for you.

01:06:09.244 --> 01:06:11.280
- What is it?
- It's for you.

01:06:12.549 --> 01:06:15.750
- It's for you.
- Wade, what is it?

01:06:15.752 --> 01:06:18.351
It's just water. It is.

01:06:18.353 --> 01:06:19.689
That's not water.

01:06:21.558 --> 01:06:24.090
It's gonna get you
back to the car.

01:06:24.092 --> 01:06:26.226
Wade, it can't.

01:06:26.228 --> 01:06:30.633
You can... You can.

01:06:32.301 --> 01:06:34.569
No, Wade.

01:06:34.571 --> 01:06:36.236
You can, kiddo.

01:06:36.238 --> 01:06:38.407
I'm not gonna let you die...

01:06:40.209 --> 01:06:42.411
knowing it was my fault.

01:06:45.482 --> 01:06:48.250
You're gonna get
yourself home.

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:52.555
Be with your dad.

01:06:53.823 --> 01:06:56.191
I'm not leaving you.

01:06:59.529 --> 01:07:02.663
You're not gonna
get your way this time.

01:07:02.665 --> 01:07:06.201
You're gonna get
yourself home. Please.

01:07:07.336 --> 01:07:09.302
Why are you saying that?

01:07:09.304 --> 01:07:12.274
I'll be right
behind you, yeah?

01:07:13.275 --> 01:07:14.575
Yeah.

01:07:14.577 --> 01:07:16.577
Okay...

01:07:16.579 --> 01:07:19.847
Okay, baby.
I'll be right behind...

01:07:19.849 --> 01:07:21.484
Wade?

01:07:22.552 --> 01:07:25.120
Wade... are you okay?

01:07:27.422 --> 01:07:28.691
What's wrong with you?

01:07:32.094 --> 01:07:34.263
Help!

01:07:35.632 --> 01:07:37.364
Help!

01:07:39.201 --> 01:07:40.801
I don't know
how to help you.

01:07:40.803 --> 01:07:42.639
Wade, please.

01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:48.709
I don't know
how to help you.

01:07:48.711 --> 01:07:50.547
Wade...

01:07:52.882 --> 01:07:55.518
I'm sorry I said no.

01:07:56.753 --> 01:07:59.352
I love you,
I do love you.

01:07:59.354 --> 01:08:00.723
I just wasn't ready.

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:03.693
I am now.

01:08:05.795 --> 01:08:07.396
Say something.

01:08:11.601 --> 01:08:14.704
- The ring...
- Yeah.

01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:19.540
I thought you'd like it.

01:08:19.542 --> 01:08:21.310
I do like it.

01:08:24.613 --> 01:08:25.715
I do.

01:10:35.912 --> 01:10:37.613
I can't.

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:41.416
I'm sorry, I can't.

01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.621
I tried. I tried.

01:10:47.623 --> 01:10:48.991
I tried.

01:10:58.534 --> 01:10:59.902
I tried.

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.642
I'm sorry.

01:15:19.762 --> 01:15:21.630
Oh, my...

01:15:53.062 --> 01:15:54.130
Okay...

01:16:09.245 --> 01:16:10.711
Okay...

01:16:13.649 --> 01:16:17.920
Go your way...
and I'll go mine.

01:16:23.993 --> 01:16:26.629
Okay.

01:18:25.748 --> 01:18:27.149
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

01:18:29.185 --> 01:18:32.321
<i>I don't know if you're listening to
this, but, um...</i>

01:18:35.224 --> 01:18:37.726
<i>I'm on the plane and...</i>

01:18:40.462 --> 01:18:44.898
<i>Wade has just proposed to me
in front of everybody,</i>

01:18:44.900 --> 01:18:47.269
<i>and I said no.</i>

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:54.174
<i>And I know it probably
doesn't even make any sense</i>

01:18:54.176 --> 01:18:56.443
<i>because everybody knows
how perfect we are together.</i>

01:18:56.445 --> 01:18:58.914
<i>He's everything to me,
you know that.</i>

01:19:01.150 --> 01:19:02.483
<i>I wanted to be with Wade.</i>

01:19:02.485 --> 01:19:04.051
<i>I want us to get married</i>

01:19:04.053 --> 01:19:06.521
<i>and have kids,
but just not yet.</i>

01:19:06.523 --> 01:19:09.156
<i>Seriously, what's the rush?
We can wait.</i>

01:19:09.158 --> 01:19:11.126
<i>I have my whole life
ahead of me.</i>

01:19:22.938 --> 01:19:25.374
Mom, I can't wait to see you.

01:20:56.298 --> 01:20:57.833
Wade?
