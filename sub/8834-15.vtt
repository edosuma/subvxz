and carbon paper, Baloo.

01:09.625 --> 01:11.709
-[Baloo] Whatever.
-Wait a minute. Before you go,

01:11.792 --> 01:14.166
I need to ask a few questions.
How are you feeling?

01:14.250 --> 01:15.083
Fine.

01:15.166 --> 01:18.500
No fever? Any coughing?
Stick out your tongue.

01:18.583 --> 01:19.625
Ah.

01:20.875 --> 01:22.208
Looks OK.

-and crashed into a mountain?
-[Baloo] So?

01:43.583 --> 01:46.500
So? What if you sneeze, crash and burn?

01:46.583 --> 01:49.000
I can't <i>put the Sea Duck</i>
in that kind of jeopardy.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.583
You're going to the doctor
for a complete checkup.

01:51.750 --> 01:55.625
-Because of a little sneeze?
-Baloo, you're going,

01:55.709 --> 01:57.458
and I won't take no for an answer.

He's going to kill me.

I'd better get this fixed
before he gets back.

02:14.625 --> 02:17.208
So, Doctor, can you fix it?

02:17.291 --> 02:22.333

Oh, you're saving my life.

-Can I see?

Mm-mm, don't touch, don't touch,
X-rays are very delicate.

Maybe I can fix it.

-Why?

04:26.792 --> 04:28.208

OK, so, no pilot's ever made it out alive.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.375
Well, I'm barely alive anyway.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.792
If I do make it out,
I'll go down in history,

06:37.166 --> 06:40.583
Ha! See? He never did anything historic.

and so is my business.

always brought her back

06:51.417 --> 06:54.417
Of course.
How shallow of me.

What's the value of the <i>Sea Duck</i>
compared to a dream?

06:58.458 --> 07:01.208

"Gee, old Baloo and I
never pitched horseshoes."

07:28.458 --> 07:31.333
Well, why would I say that?
This is stupid.

07:33.750 --> 07:37.500
Now, little britches,
I never want you to sass your elders,

07:37.583 --> 07:41.875

or let your cornflakes get soggy.

07:41.959 --> 07:45.333
Yeah, I promise.
This is still stupid.

you're president or something,

to do than play horseshoes.

08:23.125 --> 08:26.083
Of course, Baloo.
You're right.

How could you?
Where is he? Where's the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

Sit down, Kit.
There's something you should know.

-You? How?

09:22.792 --> 09:25.041
Well, I didn't mean to,
but I was playing... [mumbles]

09:25.125 --> 09:26.917
and I yanked on it and it fell off.

09:27.000 --> 09:30.709
Stop!
I don't want to hear the gory details.

09:30.792 --> 09:34.166
It's bad enough, Dr. Omeyer
said there's nothing he can do.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.083
Oh, no! Now what?

09:37.750 --> 09:40.375
Maybe I can get a spare
in the junkyard.

09:40.458 --> 09:45.125
This is a life organ,
not some part on an airplane.

09:45.208 --> 09:47.417
Yes, it is.
Right next to the flap adapter.

09:50.709 --> 09:53.125
Oh, thank heaven.

09:53.208 --> 09:58.000
I thought Baloo was dying.
He'll be so relieved to find out.

09:58.083 --> 10:01.959
Where is he? He shouldn't be flying
without that gyrocompass.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.583

the Bearmuda Trapezoid.

10:04.667 --> 10:08.208

before he kills himself.

less than zero going through this muck.

-Mountains at 12 o'clock!
-Don't think so, Kit.

11:00.583 --> 11:04.166
We should be getting there before noon.

11:14.000 --> 11:15.709
[squawking]

11:16.375 --> 11:21.583
[man]
Oh, yes, yes, this will do nicely.

11:21.667 --> 11:24.834
Look, I don't know who you are, fella,

11:24.917 --> 11:28.834
but I'm warning ya, you'd better not
ruffle one feather of the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

11:28.917 --> 11:33.542
[man] You are in no position
to be giving orders, my friend.

11:33.625 --> 11:38.709
But, come along, I'll show you
what I'm going to do with your <i>Sea Duck.</i>

11:45.834 --> 11:50.291
My <i>Titanium Turkey</i>
is the eighth wonder of the world.

11:50.375 --> 11:53.291
It will revolutionize air travel.

11:53.375 --> 11:57.667
And I only need one more device
to complete my beautiful bird:

11:57.750 --> 12:02.291
The googleschlocker gyrocompass
from your plane.

12:02.375 --> 12:05.959
[laughs] Tough luck, big shot.
I don't have one.

12:06.041 --> 12:12.000
[man] Very well. Then I'll fly without
and take your plane along as a lifeboat.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.750
What happens to me?

12:13.834 --> 12:17.500
Don't worry.
I'm merely going to lock you up...

12:17.583 --> 12:19.917
for the rest of your life.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.041
Well, considering my condition,
that shouldn't be long.

12:24.041 --> 12:28.041
-Get in!
-OK, but quit poking me with that thing.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.709
You're as bad as my doctor.

12:35.125 --> 12:38.000
Why, you're... Amelia Airhead.

12:38.083 --> 12:42.417
And the Kitty Hawk kids,
and Charles Limburger,

12:42.500 --> 12:47.500
The all-famous pilots who disappeared
in the Bearmuda Trapezoid.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.125
Uh, you, I don't recognize.

12:50.208 --> 12:53.917
No? Well, no one ever does.
I'm Oscar Wiggerstumper.

12:58.000 --> 13:02.083
[Wildcat] You know, the way planes
disappear in the Bearmuda Trapezoid,

13:02.166 --> 13:03.583
is just like my washing machine:

13:03.667 --> 13:07.083
I put two socks in, only one comes back.

13:07.166 --> 13:08.667
I've been working on the problem.

13:08.750 --> 13:14.125
-Really, my missing socks?
-No, the planes that have disappeared.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.959
Well, if they were all flying
according to regulations,

13:17.041 --> 13:19.417
they must've vanished at 10,000 feet.

13:19.500 --> 13:21.959
-So?
-If we come in really low,

13:22.041 --> 13:23.250
we might make it, OK.

13:23.333 --> 13:27.875
But that's an improper method of flying.
Flight regulations strictly forbid--

13:27.959 --> 13:30.375
Miss Cunningham,
that might be our only chance.

13:30.458 --> 13:32.875
OK, Wildcat, bring her in low.

13:32.959 --> 13:34.417
[Wildcat] Okey-dokey, Kit.

13:34.500 --> 13:37.542
[Rebecca yelling]
I'm going to die!

13:38.542 --> 13:43.125
-That's a little too low, Wildcat
-Yes, but refreshing, wasn't it?

13:43.208 --> 13:45.208
Look out for that island!

13:49.083 --> 13:50.166
[Wildcat] This island?

13:50.250 --> 13:52.959
Come on, let's go see where we are.

13:53.917 --> 13:56.250
[squawking]

13:56.667 --> 13:58.333
Look, somebody's over there.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.375
Is it Baloo?

13:59.458 --> 14:02.542
[Kit] Not unless he's been overdoing it
on the ice cream sundaes.

14:02.625 --> 14:03.875
Let's follow them.

14:05.792 --> 14:08.417
[squawking]

14:11.667 --> 14:12.500
[gasps]

14:12.583 --> 14:17.125
Wow, that is one major airplane.

14:17.208 --> 14:19.375
[Rebecca]
And, look, he's got the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

14:19.458 --> 14:20.834
Baloo might still be alive.

14:21.333 --> 14:23.959
Hey, I recognize that guy.

14:24.041 --> 14:26.375
He was laughed out of the airplane biz.

14:26.458 --> 14:30.291
-He's a comedian?
-No, he's Howard Huge.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.875
Well, the famous airplane designer.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.792
But his designs got weird
and they gave him the axe.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.208
He's a lumberjack?

14:37.291 --> 14:41.500
Looks like he's been kidnapping planes
so he can use the parts to make that one.

14:41.583 --> 14:45.583
Yeah, and he probably thinks that
big plane will make him a big shot again.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.834
Better to be a big shot than be shot.

14:48.917 --> 14:52.750
-Huh?
-I knew it! I am going to die!

14:55.875 --> 14:59.458
[Howard]
Enjoy your stay in my little hotel.

14:59.542 --> 15:04.333
You know, in 20 years,
no one's checked out yet.

15:04.417 --> 15:06.291
-Baloo!
-Papa Bear!

15:06.375 --> 15:08.458
Wh... what are you doing here?

15:08.542 --> 15:11.750
-We followed you.
-Oh, you guys shouldn't have come.

15:11.834 --> 15:14.750
You've got your whole lives ahead of you.

15:14.834 --> 15:20.667
Me, I've just got a few grains of sand
in the hourglass of life.

15:20.750 --> 15:24.417
But you're wrong, Baloo.
There's been a big misunderstanding.

15:24.500 --> 15:26.458
The doctor called...
What was that?

15:26.542 --> 15:29.709
Huge, is testing the engine
to the <i>Titanium Turkey.</i>

15:29.792 --> 15:31.625
-He's gonna leave.
-Oh, my gosh.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.500
That means we'll be stuck here forever.

15:33.583 --> 15:35.542
Not if I can help it.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.709
This is a Cabin Cruiser 107.

15:38.792 --> 15:41.542
I remember readying how there was
something weird about the design.

15:41.625 --> 15:44.375
The way the drapes clash
with the seat covers?

15:45.625 --> 15:47.583
Seats, that was it!

15:47.667 --> 15:51.500
This plane was built with a secret
emergency exit under one of the seats.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.333
Find it and we're outta here!

15:53.417 --> 15:56.333
Why would anyone hide
the emergency exit under a seat?

15:57.375 --> 16:00.458
'Cause it's too hard climbing through
the luggage compartment.

16:01.166 --> 16:05.959
Wildcat, if we make it back home safely,
get therapy.

16:06.041 --> 16:08.750
I hope we find a way out soon.

16:08.834 --> 16:11.291
I don't have much time left.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.750
Is your watch busted?

16:12.834 --> 16:16.542
No, not exactly,
I'm going to die, Wildcat.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.625
-Everyone says that lately.
-Who else?

16:19.709 --> 16:22.375
Miss Cunningham.
All the way here, she's saying,

16:22.458 --> 16:24.709
"I'm going to die.
I'm going to die."

16:24.792 --> 16:29.583
Holy moly,
that must be the misunderstanding.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.875
Becky's a goner, too.

16:31.959 --> 16:36.250
You guys really are dying?
No kidding? The real thing?

16:37.333 --> 16:42.291
[Baloo] Yep, and here I've been
so concerned about my candle burning down,

16:42.375 --> 16:45.583
I didn't notice
Becky's being snuffed out.

16:45.667 --> 16:50.667
Oh, I'm gonna do right by that little gal
as long as she's got some wick left.

16:50.750 --> 16:54.125
Wait, are you guys dying
or running out of wax?

16:54.208 --> 16:56.375
That exit's gotta be here someplace.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.750
Oh, here, let me help you, Becky.

16:59.834 --> 17:02.417
Why don't you just sit a spell?

17:02.500 --> 17:05.083
This is no time to sit,
we have work to do.

17:05.165 --> 17:10.040
Oh, so unselfish,
even at the end of your rope.

17:10.125 --> 17:13.375
-I found it!
-Nice going, little britches.

17:13.458 --> 17:15.583
Now, let's help these others bail out.

17:15.666 --> 17:17.875
[Kit]
We got to get back to the <i>Sea Duck.</i>

17:17.959 --> 17:20.666
That's gonna be tough
as long as Huge's sidekicks

17:20.750 --> 17:22.208
are packing those peashooters.

17:22.290 --> 17:26.000
Difficult, but not impossible.
Never say die, Baloo.

17:26.083 --> 17:30.875
Oh, Becky, your optimism
is posilutely inspiring.

17:34.458 --> 17:37.250
Oh, yippee ki-yo ki-yay.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.709
At last, my fabulous <i>Titanium Turkey</i>

17:40.792 --> 17:43.792
is ready for its maiden voyage.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.000
What's he doing with the <i>Sea Duck?</i>

17:46.083 --> 17:48.041
Using it for some kind of lifeboat.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.875
That turkey needs a lifeboat.

17:49.959 --> 17:53.083
It breaks about
17 laws of aerodynamic theory.

17:53.166 --> 17:56.333
We've got to stop that porko pilot,

17:56.417 --> 18:00.125
and old Baloo's got an idea how.

18:00.709 --> 18:05.834
One whiff of this finger-licking chicken,
and Huge will come a-running.

18:13.792 --> 18:16.583
-It isn't working!
-Turn up the fan!

18:16.667 --> 18:19.667
I don't get it.
Is his nose stuffed up?

18:26.500 --> 18:29.750
[sniffing]
Mmm. Oh, nummy nums.

18:29.875 --> 18:35.458
Choco Thriller.
Ooh, I haven't had one in years.

18:35.542 --> 18:39.000
So much for my never-fail sauce.
Let's go!

18:42.166 --> 18:46.917
Can you make the climb, Becky?
I mean, in your condition, and all?

18:47.000 --> 18:49.083
I happen to be
in perfect condition, Baloo.

18:49.208 --> 18:51.583
[Baloo]
Of course you are.

18:58.709 --> 19:01.834
Let's see if this lead canary
can flap its wings.

19:05.542 --> 19:09.667
Stop!
You... you <i>Turkey </i> thieves!

19:14.667 --> 19:17.834
What terrific scenery.
Wonder why it stopped?

19:17.917 --> 19:20.166
Because we've stopped.

19:20.250 --> 19:22.750
Impossible!
A plane can't stop in midair.

19:22.834 --> 19:26.166
-The manual explicitly says--
-It's Huge!

19:26.250 --> 19:29.834
Ha! Try and steal my <i>Turkey, will they?</i>

19:29.917 --> 19:32.542
Fat, pardon the expression, chance.

19:32.625 --> 19:34.875
We have a fatal attraction.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.875
[Rebecca]
Do something, Baloo!

19:38.959 --> 19:43.000
I'm trying, but she won't budge.
It's that magnet.

19:43.083 --> 19:47.083
Too bad we don't have a magnet
of our own to counteract it.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.709
What if we patch
into the electrical system

19:49.792 --> 19:51.792
and run a current through the hull.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.959
That would turn this <i>Turkey</i>
into a magnet.

19:54.041 --> 19:57.375
Wildcat, that's a great idea!

19:57.458 --> 20:00.291
-Uh, what is?
-I'll go find some wire.

20:01.709 --> 20:03.625
[Rebecca] I-I-I don't think
we're gonna make it.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.875
Oh, what a lousy break,

20:06.000 --> 20:10.041
to have it end like this when there's
only a few days left anyhow.

20:10.959 --> 20:12.375
Gun the engine, Papa Bear.

20:14.417 --> 20:17.375
Oh, no!
The magnets are attracting each another!

20:17.458 --> 20:19.917
-We got it backwards!
-[Baloo] Backwards?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.709
Opposite poles attract,
like poles repel.

20:22.792 --> 20:26.709
You gotta... flip this plane backwards.

20:26.792 --> 20:29.709
Baloo, don't you dare!

20:29.792 --> 20:32.834
Sorry, Becky.
Everybody hang on!

20:32.917 --> 20:34.959
-Ready Kit?
-[Kit] Roger that.

20:35.041 --> 20:36.792
-[Baloo] Flaps wide open.
-[Kit] Check.

20:36.875 --> 20:39.166
-[Baloo] Accelerate the accelerator.
-[Kit] Check.

20:39.250 --> 20:41.250
-Radiate the radiator.
-Check.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.583
-Escalate the escalator.
-Check!

20:43.667 --> 20:45.834
This is the only way to fly.

20:45.917 --> 20:49.500
Hang on,
we're about to flip like a flapjack.

20:58.709 --> 21:00.542
Oh, pooh!

21:00.625 --> 21:03.208
I've lost the <i>Turkey.</i>

21:03.208 --> 21:07.166
Now all I have is leftovers.

21:07.250 --> 21:09.208
[all yelling]

21:09.291 --> 21:13.208
Baloo, I order you
to straighten this out and fly right!

21:13.291 --> 21:16.542
What is the use?
We're goners anyhow.

21:16.625 --> 21:20.083
No, it was a misunderstanding.
You're not dying.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.792
I'm not?
What about you?

21:22.875 --> 21:24.917
No, of course not.

21:25.000 --> 21:28.291
You mean...
we're both going to live?

21:28.375 --> 21:32.375
Not if you don't get control
of this stupid plane!

21:40.500 --> 21:42.583
[Rebecca] Yes, good.

21:42.667 --> 21:44.667
Well, thanks for calling, officer.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.542
That was the air police,
they arrested Howard Huge

21:47.625 --> 21:50.166
and reunited the pilots
with their families.

21:50.291 --> 21:54.583
Well, doesn't that warm
the cockpit of your heart?

21:54.667 --> 21:57.500
And speaking of warm,
that's how I feel

21:57.583 --> 22:00.417
knowing you risked your life to save mine.

22:00.500 --> 22:05.125
Well, you have your faults, Baloo,
but you're pretty special.

22:05.208 --> 22:08.500
And you were right,
I knew you'd make it back.

22:08.583 --> 22:10.750
There was never any doubt.

22:10.834 --> 22:13.041
Uh, excuse me?
Pardon me.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.875
Is that pilot position still available?
