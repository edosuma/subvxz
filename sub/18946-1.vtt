00:02.520 --> 00:04.800
# We're not going out

00:04.840 --> 00:06.680
# Not staying in

00:06.720 --> 00:09.560
# Just hanging around
With my head in a spin

00:09.600 --> 00:11.920
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

00:11.960 --> 00:15.440
# We're not going out

00:15.480 --> 00:18.640
♪ We are not going out. ♪

00:22.720 --> 00:25.560
Yeah, OK, understood.
Thanks, Geoffrey.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.120
'Hang on.'

00:27.160 --> 00:29.880
Are you talking to me whilst
you're in the bathroom?

00:29.920 --> 00:31.920
Yeah. 'Good God.

00:33.240 --> 00:34.640
'What are you wearing?'

00:36.360 --> 00:39.280
This conversation's
taken a bit of a turn.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.640
'Lee, are you speaking to me naked?'

00:41.680 --> 00:43.960
I don't know. I can't see you.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.040
Who's that?

00:45.080 --> 00:46.120
It's your dad.

00:47.640 --> 00:49.160
Sorry, I've got to go, Geoffrey,

00:49.200 --> 00:52.000
Lucy wants to use the
bathroom to kill a pig.

00:52.040 --> 00:53.680
Bye-bye.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.000
Did you want to speak to him?
Not in the bathroom, no.

00:56.040 --> 00:57.320
Why did you bring him in here?

00:57.360 --> 01:00.000
You know he's not actually inside
the magic speaking box, don't you?

01:00.040 --> 01:02.200
It's not that odd,
using the phone in the bathroom.

01:02.240 --> 01:05.400
Well, not for a man who goes to the
toilet when he's in a phone box.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.120
Next time my dad calls,
can you take it in the living room?

01:08.160 --> 01:09.400
Have a bit of dignity.

01:16.880 --> 01:18.960
You have got to be kidding me.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.400
What's the problem?

01:20.440 --> 01:21.600
I'm still here?

01:21.640 --> 01:22.920
And?

01:22.960 --> 01:25.960
Just think there should be a bit of
mystery surrounding this thing.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.200
What do you want me to do,

01:27.240 --> 01:30.240
reach round and whip out
a bunch of flowers?

01:30.280 --> 01:31.760
Why are you suddenly so bothered?

01:31.800 --> 01:34.640
I sometimes go to the toilet when
you're in the shower. Do you?

01:34.680 --> 01:38.600
Don't look so shocked. You go to the
toilet while you're in the shower!

01:40.040 --> 01:43.280
If it's bothering you so much,
leave. I'm cleaning my teeth.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.560
Well, use the kitchen sink.
You use the kitchen sink!

01:47.280 --> 01:48.320
Ok!

01:51.080 --> 01:53.640
Er, excuse me?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.280
Could you close the door, please?

01:55.320 --> 01:57.000
Unbelievable!

02:02.560 --> 02:06.160
There's your orange juice.
Has it got bits in? No.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.560
I want bits in.

02:11.160 --> 02:13.120
There. Now it's got bits in.

02:13.160 --> 02:14.720
I'm off to work.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.440
Those rockets aren't going to fire
themselves, are they, Molly?

02:17.480 --> 02:20.440
You don't have to keep pretending
you're an astronaut, Daddy.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.120
We love you, whatever you do.

02:22.160 --> 02:23.680
I sell cars.

02:23.720 --> 02:25.640
That's rubbish!

02:27.240 --> 02:30.080
Right, I'm going. OK, see you later.

02:30.120 --> 02:31.600
Is that it?

02:31.640 --> 02:33.640
What? Well, aren't
you going to miss me?

02:33.680 --> 02:35.560
I don't know.
Are you going to leave?

02:35.600 --> 02:37.440
You could say goodbye
to me properly.

02:41.440 --> 02:44.160
Wow. But not in front of the kids.
We'll traumatise them.

02:44.200 --> 02:45.920
What's your problem this morning?

02:45.960 --> 02:47.440
I'll tell you my problem.

02:47.480 --> 02:49.440
Where's the intimacy gone
in our relationship?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.960
I just did a great big wee in front
of you. That's fairly intimate.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.520
It's not very romantic, is it?

02:54.560 --> 02:57.120
Well, I'm sorry that I don't go to
the toilet romantically enough.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.480
Maybe next time
I'll sit there playing the harp.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.280
After all, you sometimes sound like
you're in there with a tuba.

03:04.840 --> 03:08.280
Look, it's not just the toilet
thing. It's romance in general.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.040
Do you know that since
we've had the kids,

03:10.080 --> 03:12.520
we haven't had a single night away,
just the two of us? So?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.360
That's your choice,
just as much as mine. No, it's not.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.000
Do you remember what I asked
for on my last birthday?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.440
Oh, not this again.

03:19.480 --> 03:21.560
The Orient Express
is very expensive!

03:21.600 --> 03:22.880
We did the next best thing.

03:22.920 --> 03:26.040
The next best thing to the
Orient Express is not Pizza Express!

03:27.520 --> 03:30.040
And you know it's not just
about the money.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.320
OK, so I don't like leaving the kids
with other people.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.640
I want to be near them
in case they need me.

03:36.680 --> 03:39.280
Mummy, there's a burnt
bit on my toast.

03:39.320 --> 03:42.280
Well, phone social services!

03:42.320 --> 03:44.560
All right, what about tonight?
Me and you

03:44.600 --> 03:47.600
go out for something to eat.
I'll find us a nice restaurant.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.960
Sounds nice.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.280
But...?

03:50.320 --> 03:52.600
Well, if we go out,
we only have to come back.

03:52.640 --> 03:55.000
And we're already here.

03:55.040 --> 03:57.520
All that dressing up,
choosing a restaurant...

03:57.560 --> 04:00.040
Yeah, it's not easy, is it?
Putting clothes on and eating.

04:00.080 --> 04:01.960
Maybe we should just stay at
home in our pants

04:02.000 --> 04:03.440
and suck on a damp flannel.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.800
OK, we'll stay at home,
but we're doing it properly.

04:07.840 --> 04:08.960
I'll cook us dinner.

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
We don't watch television, and we
don't eat until the kids are in bed.

04:12.040 --> 04:13.680
OK, if you insist.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.760
If I insist?

04:14.800 --> 04:17.079
I'm not asking you to
dress as a lollipop lady

04:17.120 --> 04:18.600
and spank me with the sign!

04:20.959 --> 04:23.120
It's supposed to be romantic. OK.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.000
So I'm saying yes, fine, OK? Great.

04:25.040 --> 04:28.480
Well, I'll look forward to it, then.
Well then, so will I. Fine.

04:32.600 --> 04:35.240
Are you two getting divorced?

04:35.280 --> 04:37.280
Just eat your orange juice.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.760
Coming, ready or not!

04:48.000 --> 04:50.920
Are they hiding in the cupboard
under the stairs?

04:50.960 --> 04:54.560
No, they're not in the
cupboard under the stairs.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.560
Are they hiding under
the kitchen table?

04:57.600 --> 05:01.480
No, they're not hiding
under the kitchen table.

05:01.520 --> 05:03.240
Where can they be?

05:03.280 --> 05:06.800
Maybe I should
look behind the curtains.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.680
No, they're not behind the curtains.

05:09.720 --> 05:11.680
We are behind the curtains!

05:14.760 --> 05:16.240
I meant under the carpet.

05:17.680 --> 05:18.920
Come on.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.840
Charlie's been sick at Beavers.

05:21.880 --> 05:24.400
Don't worry, son,
I once sneezed at an otter.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.840
Oh, why's it so gloomy in here?

05:30.360 --> 05:32.080
I was going for an ambience.

05:32.120 --> 05:35.080
Is the ambulance for me?

05:35.120 --> 05:37.240
Not an ambulance, an ambience.

05:37.280 --> 05:41.520
It means when you're trying to
create...an ambience.

05:44.800 --> 05:46.840
Oh!

05:46.880 --> 05:49.080
Oh, so that's where they are.
I had no idea!

05:49.120 --> 05:51.120
We did tell you.

05:51.160 --> 05:54.800
Oh, that was your voice, was it?
I'll cancel the priest.

05:54.840 --> 05:56.520
Let's get them to bed.

05:56.560 --> 05:59.480
I can't help tonight, can I?
I'm cooking, remember? Yeah...

05:59.520 --> 06:02.400
OK, I'll sort the kids out.
What are you doing?

06:02.440 --> 06:05.840
Just grabbing a banana. I'm
starving. Well, don't grab a banana.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.720
It will spoil your dinner.
Why, is that what we're having?

06:10.640 --> 06:12.000
Molly, you know when you do that

06:12.040 --> 06:13.840
and it's not your birthday,
a fairy dies?

06:13.880 --> 06:16.560
MOLLY WAILS

06:16.600 --> 06:19.720
Come on, kids. Daddy's busy.

06:19.760 --> 06:21.600
I'm just trying to
create an atmosphere.

06:21.640 --> 06:24.320
Well, I'm hungry and the kids
are upset, so well done.

06:24.360 --> 06:25.520
Mission accomplished.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.960
ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS

06:32.000 --> 06:34.640
Oh. You've changed.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.400
No big deal. Same pants.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.480
They must be due their
annual service soon.

06:41.960 --> 06:43.760
Oh, looks lovely. Thanks.

06:43.800 --> 06:45.160
It's a Jamie Oliver thing.

06:45.200 --> 06:46.480
I was going to do Heston,

06:46.520 --> 06:49.000
but I didn't have a
hydrovacuated testicular spatula.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.120
It's a Moroccan lamb dish.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.520
Made with loads of different spices
and cooked in a sauce made from...

06:57.760 --> 07:00.200
Made from chicken beaks
and cats' faces.

07:00.240 --> 07:01.960
Oh, sounds lovely.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.640
Are you texting?

07:03.680 --> 07:04.720
No.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.280
Yes, you are. You're on the phone.

07:06.320 --> 07:08.920
I know, but I'm not texting.
I was on Tinder!

07:10.200 --> 07:12.440
I'm just looking up
Charlie's symptoms.

07:12.480 --> 07:14.120
Well, whilst you're
on the NHS website,

07:14.160 --> 07:16.240
you might want to look up the
medical effects of having

07:16.280 --> 07:18.640
a lamb tagine force-fed
down your oesophagus.

07:19.840 --> 07:21.800
Charlie will be fine.

07:21.840 --> 07:23.880
Come on, it's supposed to be
a romantic meal.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.240
Took me ages to do this cooking.
Thanks.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.720
And I do appreciate you going to the
same effort I go to every night.

07:31.800 --> 07:33.680
In fact, if this
is the effect it has,

07:33.720 --> 07:36.440
I should go to the toilet
in front of you more often!

07:36.480 --> 07:38.080
It wasn't just the toilet thing.

07:38.120 --> 07:41.040
I just worry sometimes that we're
not concentrating on each other

07:41.080 --> 07:42.360
as much as we should be.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.200
Is this you asking me for more sex?

07:44.240 --> 07:46.200
No.

07:46.240 --> 07:49.120
Well, were you about to suggest...?
No. It's not about sex.

07:49.160 --> 07:52.200
It's about me and you not forgetting
to be romantic with each other,

07:52.240 --> 07:54.160
like we are being now.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.360
Look, Lee, I really appreciate
everything you've done tonight.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.760
And it's sweet that you're
so concerned about us, but,

07:59.800 --> 08:01.400
honestly, we're doing fine!

08:01.440 --> 08:02.720
I love you.

08:02.760 --> 08:05.280
Along with the kids, you're
the most important thing in my life,

08:05.320 --> 08:08.240
and I don't take that
for granted, ever.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.640
And I certainly don't
think I've lost the romance.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.040
Are you sure?

08:12.080 --> 08:13.240
I'm sure.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.440
Ok.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.040
Happy anniversary.

08:28.320 --> 08:30.240
Well, aren't you going to open it?

08:33.120 --> 08:34.960
It's not today, is it?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.120
Oh, I think it is.

08:37.159 --> 08:39.760
Well, you're obviously overwhelmed.
I'll open it for you.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.240
Are you sure it isn't tomorrow?

08:41.280 --> 08:43.679
Oh, no, tomorrow is a different
special day altogether.

08:43.720 --> 08:47.640
It's the one-day anniversary of the
that day you forgot our anniversary.

08:48.640 --> 08:51.160
Look, it's that
special vintage hourglass

08:51.200 --> 08:52.880
we saw in that antiques shop.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.880
Well, I haven't really
forgotten our anniversary.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.520
Oh, so?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.680
I'll give you three minutes
to think of something.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.240
Well, maybe there's a present
waiting for you to unwrap

09:12.280 --> 09:14.440
when we get upstairs.

09:14.480 --> 09:17.000
Oh? An actual present? Could be.

09:17.040 --> 09:20.040
Or do you mean me taking your
clothes off, because unless you've

09:20.080 --> 09:23.120
got some Debenhams vouchers tucked
under there, that doesn't count!

09:24.560 --> 09:26.840
Is this why you've been
acting odd all day?

09:26.880 --> 09:28.960
Going on about the lack of romance?

09:29.000 --> 09:31.800
Oh, Lucy, forget about it.
It doesn't matter.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.840
This is just a silly little
something to say that the

09:34.880 --> 09:37.120
sands of time
are like my love for you.

09:37.160 --> 09:38.720
Always flowing.

09:38.760 --> 09:41.840
And if at times our love
has the appearance of ebbing away,

09:41.880 --> 09:44.720
you just have to put a little bit
of effort in and very soon

09:44.760 --> 09:49.520
you can turn things round and
see the love flowing once again.

09:49.560 --> 09:50.680
I hate you!

10:00.120 --> 10:02.520
How's Charlie?
He's completely fine this morning.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.440
Oh, good. Looks like I'm the only
ill one in the house.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.000
Why, what's up with you?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.560
Well, I'm obviously
lovesick, aren't I?

10:10.600 --> 10:11.720
Oh.

10:11.760 --> 10:14.600
Look, Lee, I'm really sorry, OK?

10:14.640 --> 10:18.200
Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it.
Forgive and forget.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.160
I'll do the forgiving, you do the...

10:21.400 --> 10:25.520
It's a joke. It's just, I've got so
much on with the kids at the moment.

10:25.560 --> 10:28.040
There's so many things I need
to remember. Exactly.

10:28.080 --> 10:29.280
And you do a great job.

10:29.320 --> 10:31.440
You remembered your cousin's
birthday last week.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.080
You remembered Halloween and
you remembered St George's Day,

10:34.120 --> 10:35.400
and you remembered Pancake Day

10:35.440 --> 10:37.480
and you remembered Charlie's
teacher's birthday

10:37.520 --> 10:39.680
and you remembered
your mum and dad's anniversary.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.480
And you even remembered the date

10:41.520 --> 10:44.520
that Starbucks brought back
the pumpkin spiced latte.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.680
You remember
all the important dates.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.480
Everything except our
wedding anniversary, yeah?

10:50.520 --> 10:53.440
Yeah, but only because I've got
a very clever method for remembering it.

10:53.480 --> 10:56.600
Every year, it falls on exactly
the same day that we got married.

10:57.880 --> 10:59.520
The most important day of my life.

10:59.560 --> 11:02.320
So you are annoyed.

11:02.360 --> 11:04.120
It's not your fault, it's mine.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.800
For being an overly sensitive,
achingly romantic,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.000
soppy old softie pants with
a heart full of love to give.

11:11.800 --> 11:13.080
I'm going to be late.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.760
Bye.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.400
I mean...

11:16.440 --> 11:19.080
Bye, darling, have a great day!

11:21.880 --> 11:24.160
Oh, careful.
It's not our anniversary today.

11:24.200 --> 11:25.440
That was yesterday.

11:37.040 --> 11:38.160
Hello?

11:40.520 --> 11:42.440
CHILDREN: Surprise!

11:42.480 --> 11:44.400
# Happy birthday to you

11:44.440 --> 11:47.120
♪ Happy birthday to you... ♪

11:47.160 --> 11:50.720
It's not my birthday.
It's the only thing they can do.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.360
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

11:54.120 --> 11:56.480
Oh, no, you ruined my ambience.

11:57.800 --> 11:59.280
Wow, this is fantastic!

11:59.320 --> 12:01.600
And we got you
one or two little gifts.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.000
Oh, look, you got me
all my favourite things.

12:04.040 --> 12:07.520
Chocolates, biscuits,
selection of French cheeses,...

12:07.560 --> 12:08.800
There isn't any cheese.

12:08.840 --> 12:10.960
Oh, my mistake,
it's just because I love cheese,

12:11.000 --> 12:13.840
so I presumed that you'd just...
I'll get you some cheese tomorrow!

12:15.960 --> 12:18.640
Oh! Now I'm the one
feeling bad. Why?

12:18.680 --> 12:20.680
Well, if I hadn't been
a silly old romantic

12:20.720 --> 12:22.440
and remembered our anniversary,

12:22.480 --> 12:26.000
you wouldn't be doing all of this
because you're wracked with guilt.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.000
I see.

12:28.040 --> 12:29.960
Kids, go and play upstairs.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.720
Uh-oh!

12:35.480 --> 12:37.480
How long, then? What?

12:37.520 --> 12:40.320
How long are you going to put me
on the naughty step for this?

12:40.360 --> 12:43.720
Four-year-olds get four minutes,
six-year-olds get six minutes,

12:43.760 --> 12:44.880
what do I get?

12:44.920 --> 12:47.760
Nobody deserves that
amount of punishment.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.200
It really doesn't make
any difference what I do

12:50.240 --> 12:51.960
or what I get for you now, does it?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.920
I'd still quite like the cheese.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.640
No chance. What's the point?

12:55.680 --> 12:57.400
I'll always be the one who forgot,

12:57.440 --> 12:59.960
and we'll remember that every year,
won't we? Well, I will.

13:02.680 --> 13:07.040
The terrible old wife who forgot
our seventh wedding anniversary.

13:07.080 --> 13:08.160
Eighth.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.960
You know what, Lee?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.520
So what if I forgot
our poxy anniversary?

13:19.560 --> 13:22.440
I think this year was copper.
14th is poxy.

13:22.480 --> 13:26.720
What is one little mistake
against hundreds? Like what?

13:26.760 --> 13:29.200
Like last year's anniversary
and that wonderful,

13:29.240 --> 13:31.040
romantic set of pans?

13:31.080 --> 13:34.280
I thought that was a very
romantic gesture, actually.

13:34.320 --> 13:37.480
And all because
the lady loves Tefal.

13:37.520 --> 13:39.200
They weren't just a set of pans,

13:39.240 --> 13:42.280
they were nonstick
heat-resistant thermostat pans.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.720
Oh, I didn't realise.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.840
I thought they were your ordinary,
run-of-the-mill misogynistic ones.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.000
Handed to me with
those loving words,

13:49.040 --> 13:51.440
"What are you going
to cook in these, then?"

13:51.480 --> 13:54.160
If I remember rightly,
there were other romantic gestures

13:54.200 --> 13:56.360
I made that day that were
thrown back in my face.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.920
Lee, climbing into bed drunk

13:57.960 --> 14:00.200
and climbing on top of me
while I'm asleep,

14:00.240 --> 14:03.280
shouting, "Wake up, Lucy,
it's that time of year again!"

14:03.320 --> 14:05.960
does not constitute romance!

14:06.000 --> 14:08.400
Well, neither do the words,
"Get off me,"

14:08.440 --> 14:09.760
"You stink of Bailey's" and,

14:09.800 --> 14:12.240
"Have you still got
the receipt for those pans?"

14:12.280 --> 14:14.520
KNOCK ON DOOR

14:17.080 --> 14:20.960
Hello. We just popped round to wish
you a happy wedding anniversary.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.120
I know it was yesterday

14:22.160 --> 14:24.640
but we didn't want to disturb you
on your special day.

14:24.680 --> 14:26.640
Oh, how nice of you to remember.

14:27.840 --> 14:30.480
Actually, we're not staying.
Just on my way out, anyway.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.520
Well, I suppose we do have time
for a quick cup of tea.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.520
The romance has gone in
our relationship.

14:44.560 --> 14:47.400
Oh, don't be like that.
I've just bought you a muffin.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.480
Anyway, it's not all bad.
Congratulations on your anniversary.

14:51.520 --> 14:54.160
Have you not been listening?
She forgot about it.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.760
And that is why I'm
congratulating you.

14:56.800 --> 15:00.000
I could live off a moral victory
like that for months.

15:00.040 --> 15:02.080
It's not a victory, though,
is it? Course it is.

15:02.120 --> 15:04.480
You remembered, she forgot.
1-0 to you.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.520
Why do you constantly
see marriage as

15:06.560 --> 15:09.440
a war of attrition between
two completely opposing sides?

15:09.480 --> 15:13.800
I don't. I see mine as a simple
war between good and evil.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.360
I just thought,
as the kids get older,

15:17.400 --> 15:19.200
you'd get more time
to spend together.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.120
Yep, that's another problem.

15:21.160 --> 15:24.480
Seriously, though, you've been
married longer than me.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.040
Is it normal for this to happen?

15:26.080 --> 15:28.640
Of course it's normal. Relax.

15:28.680 --> 15:31.920
At the moment, it might feel like
the romance is fading a bit but,

15:31.960 --> 15:33.480
a few years down the line,

15:33.520 --> 15:36.880
you'll realise that
it wasn't fading at all.

15:36.920 --> 15:38.480
It was stone-cold dead.

15:40.880 --> 15:44.680
Did I detect an atmosphere between
you and Lee as we came in?

15:44.720 --> 15:46.680
I don't really want to
talk about it.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.600
I thought your marriage
might be in trouble,

15:48.640 --> 15:50.640
but I didn't want to
get my hopes up.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.360
So, what's up?

15:53.400 --> 15:55.800
Well, Lee's got it into his head
that there's not enough

15:55.840 --> 15:57.280
romance between us.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.280
Romance? Pfft, what does that mean?

15:59.320 --> 16:02.800
I'll fetch you a dictionary,
Geoffrey. I know what it means.

16:02.840 --> 16:05.560
And you've got a gift subscription
to Good Housekeeping Magazine

16:05.600 --> 16:06.640
to prove it.

16:08.240 --> 16:12.200
Look, I'm sure it's nothing serious.
It was your anniversary yesterday.

16:12.240 --> 16:15.120
You celebrated that, didn't you?
Course we did.

16:15.160 --> 16:17.640
We had a lovely dinner at home.
Oh, yes.

16:17.680 --> 16:21.040
And I bet I can guess who was the
one slaving over the oven all day.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.200
Well, just a bit of simple cooking.

16:24.240 --> 16:25.880
It's not that difficult, is it?

16:25.920 --> 16:28.360
Course it is.
It takes time and effort.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.720
It shows a person is considerate,
thoughtful and loving.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.560
Oh, hush now!

16:34.600 --> 16:37.280
Your dad's right.
These things really matter.

16:37.320 --> 16:40.240
If want my advice on how to put some
spice back into your marriage...

16:40.280 --> 16:41.720
Oh, please don't, Mum.

16:41.760 --> 16:44.840
I don't really want to think of
your marriage as having spice in it.

16:44.880 --> 16:49.040
It's a lot easier for me to think
of it as a plain omelette.

16:49.080 --> 16:50.920
Spend more time together.

16:50.960 --> 16:54.040
That's easy for you to say.
You're not married to Lee.

16:54.080 --> 16:56.800
We do spend time together.
Every day.

16:56.840 --> 16:59.280
We're raising three kids. Exactly.

16:59.320 --> 17:01.520
That's why you should
have the occasional night away

17:01.560 --> 17:02.680
from the children.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.240
That's what Lee said, actually.
He's right.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.359
Remember when you were five,
that caravan holiday in Dorset?

17:08.400 --> 17:10.599
I think I do remember it.
I don't.

17:10.640 --> 17:15.280
You went with your grandparents.
Geoffrey and I were in Paris.

17:15.319 --> 17:17.520
You remember that, don't
you, Geoffrey?

17:17.560 --> 17:18.680
I certainly do.

17:20.599 --> 17:21.880
Most pleasant.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.920
You know we'd be delighted to stay
over and look after the children.

17:28.960 --> 17:32.200
You can even do your speciality
dish for them, can't you, Geoffrey?

17:32.240 --> 17:35.200
Of course. My toad-in-the-hole
was the talk of the regiment.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.760
I love these pans, by the way.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.280
Oh, surprise!

17:51.320 --> 17:54.400
Bit of a heartless way
to say you're leaving me.

17:54.440 --> 17:57.880
Do you remember asking for
a particular present? You haven't.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.000
I have!

17:59.040 --> 18:00.920
Are those suitcases full
of French cheese?!

18:00.960 --> 18:03.280
Better than that.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.040
Orient Express tickets?

18:05.080 --> 18:06.960
Well, not quite,
we're not made of money,

18:07.000 --> 18:09.680
but it's still a fancy train
and we get to sleep on it.

18:09.720 --> 18:10.720
You're taking me?

18:10.760 --> 18:13.360
No, Lee, I'm taking
my secret lesbian lover.

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
I won't need a ticket, then.
I'll be hiding in the wardrobe.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.680
I thought you were getting
a bit fed up with me lately. I am.

18:19.720 --> 18:21.760
That's why we're going.
I should have had an affair.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.640
We could've gone to Disneyland!
Well, come on, then, get changed.

18:24.680 --> 18:26.600
What, we're going tonight?
What about the kids?

18:26.640 --> 18:28.800
Mum and Dad said they'd look
after them. The poor sods.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.640
No, they were happy
to babysit, actually.

18:30.680 --> 18:32.320
I meant the kids.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.080
At least getting them to
sleep will be easy.

18:34.120 --> 18:36.800
Half an hour with your dad and
they'll take themselves off to bed!

18:41.400 --> 18:44.240
Well, those surprises
keep coming, don't they?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.000
It's the first train I've been
on where there is

18:55.040 --> 18:56.640
no chewing gum stuck under the seat.

18:56.680 --> 19:00.240
Never mind. You'll just have to buy
your own, like everyone else.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.720
This is really posh. I know! Look.

19:02.760 --> 19:05.680
Even the salt pot's got the name
of the train written on it.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.720
Quick, pass me my handbag.

19:08.760 --> 19:10.640
You're not nicking a salt pot.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.560
Well, guess who's not going to
be allowed to lick his plate, then.

19:17.200 --> 19:18.640
You're not my real dad.

19:19.800 --> 19:21.960
Thanks, Lucy. This is so...

19:22.000 --> 19:23.320
Romantic?

19:23.360 --> 19:26.480
Exactly. Well, trains are
romantic places, aren't they?

19:26.520 --> 19:30.560
Think of all those films.
Doctor Zhivago, Brief Encounter...

19:30.600 --> 19:33.280
The Taking Of Pelham 123.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.320
I'm not sure that's romantic.
It was for me.

19:36.360 --> 19:38.960
I watched it with my first
girlfriend, Michaela Bradbury.

19:39.000 --> 19:41.120
We were on our sofa,
and halfway through the film,

19:41.160 --> 19:44.120
she turned to me and asked if I'd
ever properly felt a woman before.

19:44.160 --> 19:46.520
And I hadn't.
So I leaned over and...

19:46.560 --> 19:49.760
I've misjudged this anecdote,
haven't I? Never mind.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.040
Tell me what happened next,

19:51.080 --> 19:54.080
and I can tell you all about what
I got up to with Andrew Kingsley.

19:54.120 --> 19:56.720
Is he an old school boyfriend?
No, he's our postman.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.520
I hope this makes up for
forgetting our anniversary.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.000
What anniversary?

20:04.040 --> 20:05.320
Good answer.

20:05.360 --> 20:07.280
And I hope you're not
missing the kids too much.

20:07.320 --> 20:09.440
What kids? Good answer.

20:09.480 --> 20:13.120
I'm enjoying being with
just you. It's nice.

20:13.160 --> 20:16.480
Just having quality time with
a husband I love and cherish...

20:16.520 --> 20:18.720
Do you want to phone them?
Yes, please!

20:21.360 --> 20:24.120
Hey, why don't I order us
a bottle of champagne

20:24.160 --> 20:26.000
to take back to the cabin?

20:26.040 --> 20:27.920
Oh, you won't hear me complaining.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.640
But we might hear you...moaning.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.120
Why? Is it really expensive?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.440
Oh!

20:40.280 --> 20:42.680
'Lucy!' Hi, Dad, just me.

20:42.720 --> 20:45.000
Tell me where you are
and I'll come and collect you.

20:45.040 --> 20:46.400
No need for that.

20:46.440 --> 20:49.240
It's all going very well, actually.
How are the children?

20:49.280 --> 20:50.720
'All tucked up in bed,'

20:50.760 --> 20:52.360
fast asleep.

20:52.400 --> 20:56.040
Thanks, Dad. Looks like it all
turned out all right in the end.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.400
Even if some idiot did forget
our anniversary.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.360
You shouldn't be too hard
on him about that.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.480
No, it was me.
I'm the one who forgot.

21:02.520 --> 21:04.480
You as well?

21:04.520 --> 21:06.800
'Quite the pair, aren't you?'

21:06.840 --> 21:08.080
What do you mean?

21:08.120 --> 21:11.960
Well, I rang him up, the morning
of your anniversary, to remind him.

21:14.240 --> 21:18.320
'Yeah, he was in the bathroom at the
time and he hadn't got a clue.'

21:18.360 --> 21:19.440
What?!

21:19.480 --> 21:21.720
So, you see, you're both idiots.

21:21.760 --> 21:26.040
OK, then, Dad, thanks.
See you later. Bye.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.200
I ordered the champagne.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.520
Oh, damn, I meant to ask Dad
something. Oh, never mind.

21:33.560 --> 21:34.680
I'll ask you instead.

21:34.720 --> 21:38.240
Why did Dad ring
the other morning?

21:38.280 --> 21:39.880
What?

21:39.920 --> 21:43.520
You remember. You were speaking to
Dad on the phone in the bathroom.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.680
On the morning of our anniversary.

21:45.720 --> 21:47.720
I can't remember now.

21:47.760 --> 21:50.520
Come on. You're always the one
who remembers everything.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.800
Remember?

21:52.800 --> 21:56.200
Oh, yes, that's it.
He had trouble with his crossword.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.240
Yeah, racehorse,
won the Grand National, 1981.

22:00.280 --> 22:02.680
Devious little bastard.

22:04.560 --> 22:05.840
I said Aldaniti.

22:08.120 --> 22:10.760
You forgot our anniversary, too.

22:10.800 --> 22:12.240
No, I didn't. Yes, you did.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.520
I cooked you a meal
and bought you a present.

22:14.560 --> 22:17.200
Yeah, 12 hours later, but there
were no presents in the morning

22:17.240 --> 22:19.280
because you hadn't got
me anything in the morning.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.960
You'd forgotten all about it
until my dad reminded you.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.920
Oh, what does it matter
how I remembered?

22:23.960 --> 22:26.560
I could have put it in the diary
or put a little alert on my phone.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.360
I just happened to go with the
system of having your dad ring me

22:29.400 --> 22:30.680
completely out of the blue.

22:30.720 --> 22:32.640
I'm still the romantic one
in this relationship.

22:32.680 --> 22:35.080
OK...what colour eyes have I got?

22:37.040 --> 22:38.360
Oh, don't be so stupid.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.040
What colour are they?

22:43.720 --> 22:45.560
Come on.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.160
What, both of them?

22:49.000 --> 22:50.720
You don't know, do you?

22:50.760 --> 22:53.160
Can I phone your dad?
What colour are they?

22:54.280 --> 22:56.480
They are... Yes?

22:57.680 --> 23:00.600
I've always seen them as the
colour of the spring skies

23:00.640 --> 23:02.480
in that moment just after dawn.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.160
They're green, Lee!
I've got green eyes.

23:05.200 --> 23:09.040
They're going red at the moment.
All right, what colour are my eyes?

23:12.720 --> 23:14.160
All right, I messed that up.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.640
You tricked me into taking you away.
Tricked you?

23:16.680 --> 23:18.680
This is supposed to be
a romantic trip.

23:18.720 --> 23:20.080
A guilt trip is what it is.

23:20.120 --> 23:23.160
Only because you are guilty,
because you forgot our anniversary.

23:23.200 --> 23:26.000
She forgot our anniversary.
So did he!

23:26.040 --> 23:27.920
OK, so maybe I was
a little bit dishonest.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.360
But I did it for a good reason.
What good reason?

23:30.400 --> 23:33.040
So that me and you could spend some
romantic quality time together

23:33.080 --> 23:35.560
which, if you hadn't noticed,
is exactly what we're doing now!

23:35.600 --> 23:38.440
Oh, yeah, because you're a great
big romantic, you are, aren't you?

23:38.480 --> 23:41.160
And by the way, Barry White,
I forgot to say thank you for

23:41.200 --> 23:43.440
the anniversary present
of an egg timer.

23:43.480 --> 23:45.000
That was a vintage hourglass.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.600
It was a second-hand egg timer

23:46.640 --> 23:50.000
for timing the eggs I'm meant to
boil in your crappy pans.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.840
They are good, solid pans.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.920
Tefal!

23:54.960 --> 23:56.720
That's another thing.
It's all very well,

23:56.760 --> 23:59.000
you getting all squeamish about
me peeing in front of you.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.200
She does that, as well.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.840
But that's as nothing compared to
the nonstop belching and

24:02.880 --> 24:05.680
farting you've been doing
since the day we met.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.200
You can stop listening now.

24:08.240 --> 24:10.160
Well, where the hell
does it all come from?

24:10.200 --> 24:12.560
I'm surprised people haven't
started fracking you!

24:14.200 --> 24:17.800
OK, so I'm a bit gassy. Shoot me!

24:17.840 --> 24:19.000
Shoot you?

24:19.040 --> 24:21.040
You'll take out half the carriage!

24:22.560 --> 24:25.760
Your problem is not that
we lost the romance.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.320
Your problem is that I started
stooping to your level.

24:58.760 --> 25:01.320
KNOCK ON DOOR

25:07.520 --> 25:08.720
Yes?

25:08.760 --> 25:12.080
Hello, madam. My name's Jenkins.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.840
Your husband asked me
to deliver these. Did he?

25:14.880 --> 25:17.040
Yes, by means of an apology.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.480
Apparently he's been acting like
the perfect buffoon.

25:19.520 --> 25:20.960
Is that right?

25:21.000 --> 25:22.520
What did he do?

25:22.560 --> 25:25.200
He lied about remembering
your anniversary.

25:25.240 --> 25:27.200
Anything else?

25:27.240 --> 25:28.560
You know.

25:28.600 --> 25:30.600
Yeah, I know. Does he?

25:32.040 --> 25:33.840
Is it the pans?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.160
It's not the pans.

25:36.440 --> 25:38.840
Is it for making his
lovely wife feel guilty

25:38.880 --> 25:40.560
and manipulating the situation?

25:40.600 --> 25:44.240
Even though he, of all people,
knows how easy it is to forget?

25:44.280 --> 25:46.640
Especially if you're busy being
a full-time mum

25:46.680 --> 25:48.200
to three beautiful children?

25:49.200 --> 25:50.960
And the pans.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.520
Would you like us to eject him
from the train, madam?

25:54.560 --> 25:58.160
No. Wait until
it's going a bit faster.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.680
Well, can I at least come in

26:00.720 --> 26:03.080
before the steward realises that
I've nicked this?

26:06.400 --> 26:08.320
Hell of a meal, wasn't it?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.840
We may have lost the romance a bit,

26:09.880 --> 26:11.720
but you can't say we've
lost the passion.

26:11.760 --> 26:14.080
Yeah, it was pretty passionate.

26:14.120 --> 26:16.000
Sorry, Lucy. Really.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.640
Happy anniversary.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.160
You know who I blame? Your dad.

26:25.200 --> 26:28.840
If he hadn't remembered, none
of this would have happened.

26:28.880 --> 26:30.840
So...

26:30.880 --> 26:32.320
what now? Well...

26:33.760 --> 26:36.200
..that depends, Jenkins.

26:36.240 --> 26:39.320
Did my husband ask you to do
anything else while you were here?

26:39.360 --> 26:41.480
Actually, there was some other
business he asked

26:41.520 --> 26:42.920
me to attend to, madam.

26:42.960 --> 26:45.200
Other business, Jenkins?
Yes, madam.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.000
Of a romantic nature.

26:47.040 --> 26:50.720
Well, I hope you're going to
be thorough, Jenkins.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.320
Well, I... Can I just check -

26:52.360 --> 26:54.920
we're talking about sex, right?
Yes. Right.

26:56.640 --> 27:00.880
Let's just say I undertake
my duties extremely rrrigorously.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.640
Well, can you just give me a moment

27:02.680 --> 27:05.160
to slip into something
more comfortable?

27:05.200 --> 27:06.600
Of course, madam.

27:14.760 --> 27:16.760
Drinks are ready
when you are, madam.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.920
Very good, Jenkins.

27:17.960 --> 27:19.560
I'll be with you in a minute.

27:25.880 --> 27:28.440
Oh, for god's sake.
At least lift the seat!

27:34.400 --> 27:37.120
# We're not going out

27:37.160 --> 27:39.000
# Not staying in

27:39.040 --> 27:42.040
# Just hanging around
with my head in a spin

27:42.080 --> 27:45.000
# But there is no need
to scream and shout

27:45.040 --> 27:47.680
# We're not going out
