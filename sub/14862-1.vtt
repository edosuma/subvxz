00:33.470 --> 00:36.171
I suddenly feel like changing my plans.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.908

I should probably be on top.

01:42.535 --> 01:44.268
Oh.

01:44.303 --> 01:45.437
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:45.471 --> 01:47.304
- I forgot.
- Yeah.

01:47.338 --> 01:49.840
Well, it just kinda felt like
she would be on top, you know?

01:49.874 --> 01:51.475
Yeah, no, absolutely. It's just... 

01:51.509 --> 01:52.776
since you're ovulating, you know,

01:52.811 --> 01:54.344

<i>Oh, baby.</i>

02:33.860 --> 02:35.059
(Women speaking indistinctly)

02:37.956 --> 02:39.724
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Did you say something?

02:39.759 --> 02:42.327
Is this the sexy sheets section?

02:42.361 --> 02:44.228
<i>This is the satin section.</i>

02:44.263 --> 02:45.963
What's sexy to one person is

02:45.998 --> 02:48.466
a slippery elbow in the
face to someone else.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.634
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

02:49.669 --> 02:51.735
There. That. What... what is that?

02:51.770 --> 02:53.537
It's coming from your pants.

02:55.707 --> 02:57.574
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

02:57.609 --> 03:00.744
What is this? "Available
men in the vicinity"?

03:00.779 --> 03:01.945
It's "Shaggr."

03:01.979 --> 03:03.447
<i>Oh, baby.</i>

03:03.481 --> 03:05.148
I have this app as well.
That's why I'm here.

03:05.183 --> 03:08.384
Oh, my girlfriend must
have... I am gonna kill her.

03:08.419 --> 03:10.586
My... my girlfriend Josslyn
must have put this on my phone.

03:10.621 --> 03:13.790
<i>- Oh, baby.
- Your girlfriend Josslyn doesn't
like your husband?</i>

03:15.091 --> 03:17.893
Oh. I... I'm not married anymore.

03:17.928 --> 03:19.629
Huh. Neither am I.

03:19.663 --> 03:22.298

03:26.502 --> 03:29.404
(Moaning)

03:29.439 --> 03:31.540
- (Woman) You're not telling me everything.
- (Bell dings)

03:31.574 --> 03:34.976
Couldn't tell you everything.
That would take too long.

03:35.010 --> 03:36.311
I've got time.

03:36.346 --> 03:37.579
Really?

03:37.613 --> 03:39.413
You would stop the clock for me?

03:39.448 --> 03:42.015
As long as you keep it interesting.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.984
(Chuckles)

03:44.018 --> 03:45.319
There's too much pressure.

03:45.354 --> 03:48.188
I thought you thrived under pressure.

03:48.223 --> 03:49.256
Huh.

03:49.290 --> 03:51.992
(Laughs)

03:52.026 --> 03:55.862
Karen, I've been rehearsing
this in my head all morning,

03:55.896 --> 03:59.699
trying to come up with a way that...

03:59.734 --> 04:02.051
makes it so it doesn't sound
exactly like it's sounding now.

04:02.052 --> 04:02.742
Tom.

04:05.573 --> 04:09.208
I'm sick, Karen.

04:09.243 --> 04:10.276
What?

04:10.310 --> 04:12.678
The shortness of breath, the chest pains,

04:12.712 --> 04:16.180
is all due to a mass on my lung.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.416
Oh, my God.

04:17.450 --> 04:21.119
It makes my marital problems seem trivial.

04:21.153 --> 04:22.421
It makes me appreciate Liz

04:22.455 --> 04:23.655
and all of our history together... 

04:23.690 --> 04:24.757
Yes.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.458
But it forces me to confront something

04:26.493 --> 04:28.026
that I've known for a year,

04:28.060 --> 04:31.263
and that is that I

04:31.297 --> 04:34.366
<i>am in love with you, Karen.</i>

04:36.068 --> 04:38.003
Come on. Please tell me I'm not crazy.

04:38.037 --> 04:40.005
Please tell me that you feel it, too.

04:41.673 --> 04:43.374
(Man) I love you.

04:43.408 --> 04:45.242
Mm-hmm. It'll pass.

04:45.277 --> 04:48.779
(Telephone ringing) You know, I
just... I can't leave my wife right now.

04:48.813 --> 04:50.781
Don't you dare leave her.

04:50.815 --> 04:52.249
Promise me you won't.

04:52.284 --> 04:53.717
I promise.

04:53.751 --> 04:55.552
I want to start showing the
Adams property this week.

04:55.586 --> 04:57.221
Steve's in line for that property.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.889
Aren't you the boss?

05:02.026 --> 05:04.760
I have never met anyone like you, Joss.

05:04.795 --> 05:06.996
And you never will.

05:07.031 --> 05:08.231

05:19.342 --> 05:21.143
Hostile something or other? What?

05:21.177 --> 05:22.644
Well, these are just theories,

05:22.678 --> 05:24.813
you know, basically stuff
that I found on the Internet.

05:24.847 --> 05:26.815
Don't tell me you're reading
those sad old lady blogs.

05:26.695 --> 05:28.997
"I'm barren. Does that
make me less of a woman?"

05:29.031 --> 05:30.931
We do not mock infertile myrtle.

05:30.965 --> 05:32.365
She's been through enough.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.634
Harry and I are actually going

05:34.669 --> 05:35.936
to the doctor tomorrow,

05:35.970 --> 05:38.638
so hopefully, we will
get some real answers.

05:38.673 --> 05:40.407
You mean about whose fault it is?

05:40.441 --> 05:42.309
We also do not assign blame.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.377
- Okay. Okay.
- Hey. Do me a favor.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.680
Please don't tell mom any of this yet.
I haven't told her. (Water running)

05:46.714 --> 05:48.681
You're actually hoping
it's your fault, aren't you?

05:48.715 --> 05:50.183
Truthfully... (Sighs)

05:50.217 --> 05:51.951
- (Water turns off)
- It'd be a lot easier.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.552
See, this is why I'm never getting married.

05:53.586 --> 05:55.188
I can't spend the rest of my life

05:55.222 --> 05:56.488
catering to some man's precious ego.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.991
You can't stay faithful,
so who are you fooling?

05:59.026 --> 06:00.726
Oh, yeah. That, too.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.061
Hey.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.095
What time did you come in
from the restaurant last night?

06:04.130 --> 06:05.663
- Not until 3:00.
- Wow.

06:05.698 --> 06:06.865
It's getting later and later.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.234
- Hello? I'm still here.
- Sorry, Joss.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.302
Uh, I actually have to get going.

06:10.336 --> 06:11.402
I have a funeral to get to.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.839
- Whose?
- The founding partner of my firm,

06:13.873 --> 06:15.040
Thomas Grey.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.607
I'm gonna see you at April's later, right?

06:16.642 --> 06:18.076
I still haven't bought her kid a present.

06:18.110 --> 06:19.743
Can I just sign my name to your card?

06:19.777 --> 06:21.578
At what point are you gonna
start buying your own presents?

06:21.612 --> 06:22.847
I buy my own presents.

06:22.881 --> 06:24.915
I just don't buy presents for other people.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.218
Oh, gotta go. My clients are here.

06:27.252 --> 06:28.252
Hi.

06:28.286 --> 06:30.520
Oh, hi. You must be Alex and Sally.

06:30.555 --> 06:32.456
- Sally. Great to meet you.
- Oh, Sally. Alex, I'm Joss.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.657
- Yay!
- Wait until you see this house.

06:33.691 --> 06:35.791
I think you're going to love it.

06:35.826 --> 06:38.394
<i>(John Fred's "Judy in disguise" playing)</i>

06:38.428 --> 06:41.764
You see Dane filed a motion to
set aside the default judgment?

06:41.798 --> 06:43.066
It's never gonna fly.

06:43.100 --> 06:44.800
- Dane's a punk.
- Punk, yeah.

06:44.835 --> 06:46.035
Don't tweet that.

06:46.070 --> 06:47.937
You're no fun.

06:47.972 --> 06:49.973
Still okay to take the
Harlowe deposition tomorrow?

06:50.007 --> 06:51.039
I got a thing in the morning.

06:51.074 --> 06:53.275
Not a problem. I'm here to serve.

06:59.815 --> 07:01.483
We're going to a funeral, Dominic.

Welcome, everyone.

09:03.899 --> 09:08.870
Today we are gathered to grieve the death

09:08.904 --> 09:11.206

09:19.114 --> 09:21.015
Dr. Kim, before you go... 

09:21.049 --> 09:23.583
Sam. Hi.

09:23.618 --> 09:25.019
Beautiful eulogy.

09:25.053 --> 09:27.187
Mostly lies. I hardly knew him.

09:27.222 --> 09:30.524
You were there a lot
towards the end, my mom said.

09:30.558 --> 09:31.758
Yes, I was.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.693
There are things I'd
like to discuss with you

09:34.728 --> 09:36.429
when my mother isn't around.

09:36.463 --> 09:39.165
I'm sorry, but I don't... 

09:39.199 --> 09:40.599
My father was having an affair.

09:40.634 --> 09:42.935
(Savi) Karen.

09:42.969 --> 09:45.704
I'll find you at the
wake. We can talk more.

09:45.739 --> 09:48.841
If I knew you were gonna be
here, we could've carpooled.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.876
I know. I forgot you worked for him.

09:50.911 --> 09:52.845
Yeah. A founding partner.

09:52.879 --> 09:55.113

Now, Savannah, your F.S.H.

13:40.635 --> 13:42.603
And your estradiol levels
all came back great,

13:42.637 --> 13:44.404

13:44.438 --> 13:46.939

Now, Harry, your sperm count
falls in the normal range,

13:52.746 --> 13:54.881
Uh, I'm sorry. The what?

13:54.915 --> 13:59.451
You see, normal sperm have
an oval head with a long tail.

13:59.486 --> 14:02.187
Abnormal sperm has defects
that can affect the ability

14:02.222 --> 14:05.089

20:15.839 --> 20:17.306
No. No, I knew that.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.473
I just didn't want you to
think I was stalking you.

20:18.507 --> 20:19.741
You're stalking me?

20:19.775 --> 20:21.877
No. No. No. Um, this is going very bad.

20:21.911 --> 20:23.278
Very bad. (Clears throat)

20:23.312 --> 20:26.381
Hi. I heard that you owned this place,

20:26.415 --> 20:28.583
and I thought, hey, I just
got this new apartment,

20:28.617 --> 20:29.985
and I have very bad taste.

20:30.019 --> 20:31.086
It's a furnished apartment,

20:31.120 --> 20:32.754
and that's probably my first mistake.

20:32.788 --> 20:34.855
Mm. Well, it depends on who furnished it.

20:34.890 --> 20:36.823
Maybe Richard Grieco.

20:36.858 --> 20:38.192
Oh. (Laughs)

20:38.226 --> 20:40.694
Thank you for laughing.

20:40.728 --> 20:42.997
Yeah, I... I think I can help you.

20:43.031 --> 20:46.300
Maybe we can start with some
throw pillows and go from there.

20:46.334 --> 20:47.501
- Throw pillows?
- Yeah.

20:47.535 --> 20:50.169
Excellent. Would you have
dinner with me tonight?

20:50.204 --> 20:51.504
Tonight?

20:51.538 --> 20:52.705
I'll still buy the throw
pillows if you say no.

20:52.739 --> 20:54.540
I just had to ask you.

20:54.574 --> 20:57.243
I think I can get a sitter by 6:00.

20:57.278 --> 20:58.278
Great. (Laughs)

20:58.312 --> 21:00.613
Yeah. Um... 

21:00.647 --> 21:03.216
- Would you like to show me the, um...
- Yeah, some throw pillows.

21:03.250 --> 21:05.318
Right. Right. The throw pillows.

21:08.254 --> 21:09.487
(Telephone rings in distance)

21:09.522 --> 21:10.956
So I guess you got plans tonight,

21:10.990 --> 21:13.191
given your, uh, attire.

21:13.226 --> 21:14.960
Not at this rate.

21:14.994 --> 21:17.495
Okay,

21:17.530 --> 21:20.732
I will have your work done
and on your desk by 8:00 A.M.

21:20.766 --> 21:23.234
If you let me take a
look at you in that thing.

21:24.669 --> 21:25.903
That's quite an offer.

21:25.938 --> 21:29.307
No work in mind for a mere ten seconds.

21:29.341 --> 21:31.242
(Ring)

21:31.276 --> 21:32.343
(Ring)

21:37.349 --> 21:38.581
Five seconds.

21:42.820 --> 21:44.321
Done.

21:57.434 --> 21:58.968
One,

21:59.002 --> 22:00.102
two,

22:00.136 --> 22:01.937
three,

22:01.972 --> 22:03.538
four,

22:03.573 --> 22:04.673
five.

22:27.887 --> 22:30.755
Ooh. Wow. The place looks great.

22:30.789 --> 22:31.955
Do you have a reservation?

22:31.990 --> 22:34.292
You never remember me.

22:34.326 --> 22:37.127
It's amazing.

22:37.162 --> 22:39.029
I'm Savi, Harry's wife.

22:39.063 --> 22:40.964
Oh. Right.

22:40.999 --> 22:42.933
I'll, uh, let him know you're here.

Nice to see you, too.

22:55.279 --> 22:56.746
Didn't know you were coming.

22:56.781 --> 22:58.415
Yeah, I wanted to see you,

you could hand the reins over to Patrick

I'm just... trying to have some fun.

23:23.706 --> 23:25.540
And what about this is fun for me?

23:25.574 --> 23:27.875
I've spent the entire day trying
to forget about this morning.

Harry, I am so sorry.

23:35.517 --> 23:37.184

- Trying to what?

23:38.720 --> 23:40.053
Can I please get back to work now?

23:40.087 --> 23:41.688
Yeah.

23:48.463 --> 23:51.531
Actually, this is a fabulous craftsman.

23:51.566 --> 23:54.367
It's closer to hancock park,
which I know isn't ideal,

23:54.401 --> 23:56.268
but if you like this style, then I know... 

23:56.302 --> 23:57.670
Sorry. I know we're dragging
you around the earth on this.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.838
- Sorry.
- No.

23:58.872 --> 24:00.473
Well, for the money I'm willing to spend,

24:00.507 --> 24:01.741
I want it to be perfect.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.476
Naturally.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.411
And I... but I do like this one.

24:05.445 --> 24:06.645
It's sweet.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.681
- The breakfast nook and...
- Yeah.

24:08.715 --> 24:10.682
Yeah, it's cute. I mean, I'm not in love,

24:10.716 --> 24:13.251
- but I can see the charm.

24:13.285 --> 24:14.853
Hmm.

24:14.887 --> 24:16.755
That's work. I'm sorry.

24:16.789 --> 24:20.392
I'll be right back.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.527
(Beep)

24:22.561 --> 24:24.095
Should we keep looking or... 

24:24.129 --> 24:27.264
There's not really much
of a point. She's not here.

24:27.298 --> 24:28.432
She wears the pants.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.934
She pays the bills.

24:30.968 --> 24:32.603
And I don't necessarily mind it.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.206
Yes, you do.

24:36.240 --> 24:37.541
I would never have bothered you with it,

24:37.575 --> 24:42.178
except that I do think Sam
needs someone to talk to.

24:42.213 --> 24:43.212
(Sighs)

24:43.246 --> 24:45.848
I can recommend a few people.

24:45.883 --> 24:48.618
I had no idea that he went to you.

24:48.652 --> 24:49.719
And he was crying?

24:51.087 --> 24:53.322
My poor angel.

24:53.356 --> 24:55.625
He needs closure, Elizabeth.

24:55.659 --> 24:57.460
(Sighs deeply)

24:57.494 --> 24:59.127
He especially fixated on the fact

24:59.161 --> 25:00.995
that Thomas was alone when he died.

25:01.030 --> 25:02.964
I never should have told him that.

25:02.998 --> 25:04.933
No, it's best Sam knows the truth.

25:06.235 --> 25:08.069
But it's not the truth.

25:08.103 --> 25:10.472
He wasn't alone.

25:10.506 --> 25:12.607
I was with him.

25:12.642 --> 25:15.075
But I thought... 

25:16.311 --> 25:17.645
I assumed... 

25:17.679 --> 25:19.279
That he did it to himself?

25:21.550 --> 25:26.219
When the time came, he asked for my help,

25:26.254 --> 25:28.288
and I gave it to him.

25:28.323 --> 25:31.290
Thomas said that's why you
gave him the prescription,

25:31.325 --> 25:33.893
for when things got too painful... 

25:35.262 --> 25:36.629
and they did.

25:36.664 --> 25:40.399
(Crying) I know I never
should've lied to Sam,

25:40.434 --> 25:43.102
but he would never understand the truth,

25:43.136 --> 25:44.604
and I know he'd never forgive me

25:44.638 --> 25:48.173
for taking away his
chance to say good-bye.

25:48.207 --> 25:49.374
(Sniffles)

25:49.408 --> 25:51.109
You did the right thing

25:51.143 --> 25:54.212
for Sam... 

25:54.246 --> 25:56.114
and for Thomas.

25:57.684 --> 25:59.451
I should go.

26:00.487 --> 26:02.920
(Sniffles)

26:02.955 --> 26:05.422
Thank you, Karen.

26:05.457 --> 26:07.859
You've done so much for us.

26:39.589 --> 26:40.990
No, unfortunately.

26:41.024 --> 26:43.392
Good. I need you. I have a date.

26:43.426 --> 26:45.360
Mm!

26:45.395 --> 26:46.428
Is it hot dad?

26:46.462 --> 26:47.763
Yes. (Laughs)

26:47.797 --> 26:49.532
I made the mistake

26:49.566 --> 26:51.098
of calling Joss to ask her what to wear,

26:51.133 --> 26:52.534
so now she's coming over,

26:52.568 --> 26:53.968
and I need you to intervene

26:54.003 --> 26:56.771
when she tries to dress me
up like a glittery whore.

26:56.805 --> 26:59.206
Please, Savi.

27:01.143 --> 27:04.378
Get out here, you sexy beast.

27:06.881 --> 27:08.348
Amazing!

27:08.382 --> 27:11.117
Are you sure this amount... 

27:11.152 --> 27:13.253
- (Door closes)
- of glitter is age-appropriate?

27:13.287 --> 27:14.855
No. No. No. It brings out
the sparkle in your eyes.

27:14.889 --> 27:16.389
You look amazing.

27:16.424 --> 27:19.092
Oh, April,

27:19.126 --> 27:20.393
you look lovely.

27:20.428 --> 27:22.863
Thank you. She doesn't believe me.

27:22.897 --> 27:24.030
By the way, I just saw Lucy

27:24.065 --> 27:25.698
try to put play-doh up Ella's nose.

27:25.732 --> 27:26.732
The sitter is late. Let
me just go deal with her.

27:26.767 --> 27:28.301
No. No. No. Let Joss deal with it.

27:28.335 --> 27:29.469
She's great with kids.

27:29.503 --> 27:34.240
Fine. Just do not let her wear flats.

27:36.677 --> 27:37.977
Okay.

27:38.011 --> 27:39.978
Let's see what we have to work with here.

27:40.012 --> 27:41.280
Oh, honey,

27:41.314 --> 27:42.614
you own paisley,

27:42.648 --> 27:44.083
like, a lot of paisley

27:44.117 --> 27:46.452
and floral chiffon.

28:09.674 --> 28:12.041
Okay. That's it. I'm
putting my P.I. on this.

28:12.076 --> 28:14.077
We're gonna trace the number.

28:14.112 --> 28:15.212
I can't go.

28:15.246 --> 28:16.279
What?

28:16.314 --> 28:17.514
That was a sign.

28:17.548 --> 28:19.682
No, that was a crank call.

28:19.717 --> 28:21.518
Can you please call Richard
and tell him I'm sick?

28:21.552 --> 28:22.919
(Doorbell rings)

28:22.953 --> 28:26.089
Oh, God. It's too late. He's here.

28:29.493 --> 28:32.461
(Dog barking in distance)

28:35.499 --> 28:37.466
Karen.

28:37.501 --> 28:38.934
What's wrong?

28:40.903 --> 28:42.304
Everything.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.497
(Josslyn) Now I know why we
haven't seen you in so long.

28:54.531 --> 28:55.764
I'm sorry.

28:55.798 --> 29:00.202
It was just easier to avoid
everything and everyone.

29:00.237 --> 29:02.838
I didn't want to have to lie to your faces.

29:02.872 --> 29:04.906
You could've told us the truth.

29:04.941 --> 29:08.143
You would've told me to stop seeing him.

29:08.177 --> 29:09.644
I wouldn't have told you that.

29:09.678 --> 29:11.646
(Laughs)

29:11.680 --> 29:14.516
I've always known that there was

29:14.550 --> 29:16.784
something between Tom
and me for a long time,

29:16.818 --> 29:20.821
but when he told me he was sick... 

29:20.856 --> 29:22.957
(Voice breaks) I just
wanted to be with him.

29:26.161 --> 29:30.230
And I convinced myself that it was okay,

29:30.265 --> 29:32.299
that we were soul mates.

29:32.333 --> 29:34.000
Maybe you were.

29:34.035 --> 29:36.069
(Crying) No, because in
the end, he chose his wife.

29:36.103 --> 29:39.606
That's who he wanted to be
with in his last moments,

29:39.641 --> 29:42.208
which means the whole time, I was just... 

29:43.743 --> 29:45.545
a mistress.

29:45.579 --> 29:47.713
(Scoffs)

29:47.747 --> 29:50.049
I'm so sorry, honey.

29:50.083 --> 29:52.117
It's the worst feeling in the world,

29:52.152 --> 29:53.952
losing the person you love.

29:53.987 --> 29:57.589
(Josslyn) No offense, but
I feel worse for his kid.

29:57.623 --> 29:59.157
Sounds like he's a mess, you know?

29:59.192 --> 30:01.193
I know.

30:01.227 --> 30:03.295
I feel like I owe it to Sam to help him.

30:03.329 --> 30:04.829
I just don't know how.

30:06.131 --> 30:07.932
You have to cut ties with the son

30:07.966 --> 30:09.501
and the wife.

30:09.535 --> 30:10.602
What?

30:10.636 --> 30:12.836
I can't just abandon them.

30:12.870 --> 30:15.906
Karen, this is a malpractice
suit waiting to happen.

30:15.940 --> 30:18.609
If anyone finds out that you
were sleeping with your patient,

30:18.643 --> 30:23.013
let alone prescribing him
lethal doses of morphine,

30:23.047 --> 30:25.415
Karen, you could lose your license.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.285
I know, but Sam's in
pain, and he's Tom's son.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.755
Yeah, but he's not your son,

30:31.789 --> 30:34.457
and you're not Tom's wife.

30:38.995 --> 30:40.295
(Telephone rings)

30:40.330 --> 30:42.865
Are you being stalked, Savannah?

30:42.899 --> 30:43.966
What?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.768
Rick Anderson left this.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.569
Says he's been tracking
some numbers for you.

30:47.604 --> 30:49.271
Have you been getting obscene phone calls?

30:49.305 --> 30:50.372
It's for a friend.

30:50.406 --> 30:53.908
Oh. You want some obscene phone calls?

30:53.943 --> 30:56.410
I can do that.

30:56.445 --> 30:58.246
April, it's Savi.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.581
Listen, call me as soon as
you get this message, okay?

31:00.616 --> 31:01.883
Is this what you do all day,

31:01.917 --> 31:03.084
talk to your friends on the phone?

31:03.119 --> 31:04.085
Told you I could've been a lawyer.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.286
What are you doing here?

31:05.320 --> 31:06.420
I need a favor.

31:06.455 --> 31:09.189
My landlord officially kicked me out.

31:09.224 --> 31:11.091
Mm, so are you moving into Mac's house?

31:11.126 --> 31:12.492
Yeah. No, that's not gonna work out.

31:12.526 --> 31:14.327
Because you realized he
was sequestering you away

31:14.362 --> 31:16.230
just to have sex with you
whenever it pleased him?

31:16.264 --> 31:18.431
Yes, Savi. Okay? You were right,

31:18.466 --> 31:20.801
and that's why I thought we
should spend more time together,

31:20.835 --> 31:22.269
so that I can learn

31:22.303 --> 31:23.870
these valuable life
lessons from my big sister.

31:23.904 --> 31:25.604
What is it? What do you need?

31:25.639 --> 31:27.006
You always said I could
move into the pool house

31:27.040 --> 31:29.308
if need arose.

31:29.342 --> 31:30.442
It's arisen.

31:32.379 --> 31:33.412
Hmm.

31:33.446 --> 31:34.480
Please.

31:34.514 --> 31:35.714
Fine.

31:35.749 --> 31:37.150
- Really?
- Yes.

31:37.184 --> 31:38.284
Oh, thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

31:38.318 --> 31:40.786
Hello. What is happening over there?

31:44.123 --> 31:45.190
Ooh.

31:45.224 --> 31:46.357
Not for you.

31:46.392 --> 31:48.260
Oh. Mmm.

31:48.294 --> 31:51.429
I can't believe it's come to this.

31:51.463 --> 31:53.198
Come to what?

31:53.232 --> 31:57.734
Aren't we doing freudian thing
where you whip out a ball,

31:57.769 --> 32:00.037
ask me to play catch,
repair my inner child?

32:00.071 --> 32:01.705
(Laughs) No.

32:01.739 --> 32:02.840
Good.

32:02.874 --> 32:05.176
'Cause I throw like a girl.

32:05.210 --> 32:09.079
It's impossible to imagine what
goes through a person's mind

32:09.114 --> 32:11.348
when they know they're about to die.

32:11.382 --> 32:13.549
With your dad, all he wanted was

32:13.583 --> 32:17.053
to revisit the happiest
moments of his life.

32:18.889 --> 32:20.890
He coached your little league here?

32:20.925 --> 32:22.692
He did.

32:22.726 --> 32:26.229
You made a double play right there

32:26.263 --> 32:30.632
to clinch your championship that year.

32:30.666 --> 32:33.168
And that was one of his happiest moments?

32:33.203 --> 32:37.405
Not because you won,
but because when you won,

32:37.440 --> 32:42.377
all the players on your team
rushed each other to celebrate,

32:42.411 --> 32:45.713
but you rushed to your dad.

32:45.747 --> 32:47.815
I remember.

32:49.718 --> 32:51.953
His last few weeks,

32:51.987 --> 32:55.156
he came here every day.

32:55.190 --> 32:58.759
So I think... 

32:58.793 --> 33:00.393
whatever you said to him,

33:00.427 --> 33:02.062
whatever you regret,

33:02.096 --> 33:08.501
it didn't take away from
the love he had for you.

33:08.535 --> 33:10.170
Was it you?

33:12.139 --> 33:14.374
Were you the one he was sleeping with?

33:15.776 --> 33:19.211
No, Sam, I wasn't.

33:20.947 --> 33:24.716
It's time to move on.

33:29.422 --> 33:31.623
Thank you.

33:31.657 --> 33:33.791
Thank you so much.

33:35.094 --> 33:38.029
Are you sure this is
where the calls came from?

33:38.063 --> 33:40.365
Well, the last one at least.

33:42.768 --> 33:44.135
Okay.

33:44.169 --> 33:45.803
Here it is.

33:49.507 --> 33:50.974
(Sighs)

33:54.712 --> 33:56.280
Yes? Can I help you?

33:56.314 --> 33:58.681
Hi. Um, I'm April Malloy,

33:58.716 --> 34:01.251
and I've been receiving phone calls... 

34:01.286 --> 34:02.552
prank calls, I guess... 

34:02.586 --> 34:05.487
and they were traced to this room, so... 

34:05.522 --> 34:06.722
That's weird.

34:06.756 --> 34:08.257
How long have you been here?

34:08.292 --> 34:10.059
Uh, we checked in two days ago.

34:10.092 --> 34:11.060
We?

34:11.094 --> 34:13.429
My son and me.

34:13.463 --> 34:14.797
You know what? (Chuckles)

34:14.831 --> 34:17.433
He has this obsession with phones.

34:17.467 --> 34:19.135
Maybe that's what happened.

34:19.168 --> 34:20.768
So sorry. Scottie, sweetie,

34:20.803 --> 34:22.870
come here and apologize to this nice woman.

34:22.905 --> 34:24.806
Oh, no, no, no. That's fine.

34:24.840 --> 34:26.107
Thank you. Thank you for your time.

34:26.141 --> 34:27.775
Thank you.

34:27.810 --> 34:29.143
(Door closes)

34:32.081 --> 34:35.516
You okay?

34:35.551 --> 34:37.284
Oh, I feel so stupid.

34:37.319 --> 34:41.455
No. No, honey, don't feel
stupid. It's not stupid.

34:41.489 --> 34:44.123
He was the best man I ever knew.

34:47.195 --> 34:49.362
But I have to let go.

34:50.364 --> 34:52.630
I'm ready.

34:52.666 --> 34:55.001
I really think I'm ready now.

34:55.034 --> 34:57.170
I know you are.

34:57.204 --> 34:59.138
(Crying) Thank you.

34:59.173 --> 35:00.573
It's okay.

35:03.210 --> 35:04.777
Let's go.

me five minutes to clean up.

35:13.687 --> 35:15.287
I promise.

35:21.962 --> 35:23.395
You're late for work, aren't you?

35:23.429 --> 35:26.063
Running out now.

35:31.971 --> 35:33.705
By the way, Joss is only staying here

35:33.739 --> 35:36.040
until she finds a place.

35:39.011 --> 35:41.879
Sorry I didn't ask you first.

35:41.913 --> 35:43.847
It's fine.

35:43.882 --> 35:47.384
A little passive-aggressive
on your part, but whatever.

35:48.586 --> 35:50.954
(Sighs)

35:50.989 --> 35:52.890
Is that how we're doing it now?

35:52.924 --> 35:54.190
Doing what?

35:54.225 --> 35:56.359
Talk to me, Harry.

35:56.394 --> 35:58.228
What do you want to talk about?

35:58.262 --> 36:00.930
I don't care. Anything.
Just if we keep going at it

36:00.964 --> 36:02.332
like this, it's only gonna get worse.

36:02.366 --> 36:03.400
How much worse can it get?

36:03.434 --> 36:05.101
I mean, you showing up last night

36:05.136 --> 36:06.369
in that desperate getup was

36:06.404 --> 36:07.504
an all-time lie, don't you think?

36:07.538 --> 36:08.505
I was trying to connect with you.

36:08.539 --> 36:10.006
Right. Okay, because honestly,

36:10.041 --> 36:12.375
that's something I haven't
felt in a long time.

36:12.410 --> 36:13.742
Right. And that's my fault, is it?

36:13.776 --> 36:15.344
No, I'm not saying it's your fault.

36:15.378 --> 36:17.446
I'm just... 

36:17.480 --> 36:20.449
I'm trying to figure out what comes next.

36:20.483 --> 36:22.384
What comes next? Okay. Well, that's easy.

36:22.419 --> 36:24.786
We can, uh, stop counting days

36:24.820 --> 36:26.321
and we can stop taking your temperature

36:26.356 --> 36:27.523
and doing all that other crap,

36:27.557 --> 36:29.090
and you can stop worrying
that having a baby

36:29.124 --> 36:31.092
is gonna prevent you from making partner.

36:31.126 --> 36:32.427
That's not fair.

36:32.461 --> 36:33.794
But it's true, though,
right? I mean, come on.
