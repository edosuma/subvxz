01:33.260 --> 01:35.630
But my being an idiot is not a choice.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.420
And neither is my being a drunk.

Hey,tom.

Hey.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.750
Ok.

07:19.630 --> 07:21.100
Oh,my god.

08:11.000 --> 08:14.820
All right So we're all here 

08:14.820 --> 08:19.260
because we love teddy and maggie and we want them to get healthy again.

08:19.260 --> 08:22.510
Maybe that's why some of us are here.

08:22.510 --> 08:25.260
And we know they can't get healthy until they realize that 

08:25.260 --> 08:27.780
they have a problem and get proactive about it,

08:27.780 --> 08:29.660
which tommy and I can attest to.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.300
True.

08:30.300 --> 08:31.430
Yeah,look at tommy.

08:31.430 --> 08:33.650
He's as healthy as a horse,you know.

What--what's that supposed to mean?

08:35.929 --> 08:38.260
What do you think that's supposed to mean?

08:38.260 --> 08:39.840
Oh,jesus,tom,it was a compliment.

08:39.840 --> 08:41.830
Oh,yeah.That was a compliment?Ok.

08:41.830 --> 08:43.510
Why don't you say somethin' like most people,like,"hey,you look good"?

08:43.510 --> 08:45.340
You know,you try to say something nice to somebody,

08:45.340 --> 08:46.970
and what
-- Why didn't you say I look good or whatever.

08:46.970 --> 08:48.230
I mean,you're bringing animals into this.

08:48.230 --> 08:49.980
-Guys,guys,please,please.
-He started it.

08:49.980 --> 08:51.920
Give it a rest.

08:51.920 --> 08:55.460
As I was saying,I've been a part of a lot of interventions,ok?

08:55.460 --> 08:56.620
They're never easy.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.160
Some people get extremely defensive and even violent 

08:59.160 --> 09:01.920
when they're faced with the reality that is their addiction.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.450
But I just want you to remember one thing.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.430
It's for their own good.

09:06.430 --> 09:08.310
So,everybody bring their letter?

09:08.950 --> 09:11.340

What?I got a lot to say.

09:19.850 --> 09:21.370
Obviously.

09:21.720 --> 09:22.520
Ok.

09:22.520 --> 09:25.530
Now--oh,tom.

09:25.530 --> 09:27.790
I got it all up here.

09:28.280 --> 09:29.380
All right,uh,guys.

09:29.380 --> 09:31.960
I'm gonna go pick up maggie,and eddie's gonna grab teddy.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.640
Try and kill 2 birds with one stone,all right?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.650
More like a badger and a rhinoceros.

09:35.650 --> 09:36.610
Hey,whoa.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.550
Don't be callin' my wife a badger,all right?

09:38.550 --> 09:40.950
You're assuming she's the badger.

09:46.980 --> 09:49.560
I wanna see this backpack on your little back.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.230
'Cause you're too cute?

09:52.230 --> 09:53.840
'Cause you're too cute.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.750
And,oh.

09:56.620 --> 09:58.950
Oh,we got this that'd be a 2.

10:11.360 --> 10:12.940
Yeah.Ok.

10:13.330 --> 10:14.380
They're here.

10:14.380 --> 10:15.220
Yeah,I'm gonna go.

10:15.220 --> 10:16.050
Sit down!

10:16.050 --> 10:17.610
Yeah.Good idea.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.330
You all right?

10:19.330 --> 10:21.280
You just haven't said much.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.720
[Faint] I'm saving my voice.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.310
Gotcha.Gotcha.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.190
All right,guys.

10:27.900 --> 10:29.210
[Knock on door] [Sean clears throat] Hey.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.230
So come on in.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.720
Come on.

10:32.390 --> 10:33.660
Hey,mags.

10:33.660 --> 10:36.150
Ok,who died?

10:36.400 --> 10:39.170
Dad's here,so I'm guessin' it's teddy.

10:39.170 --> 10:41.920
Uh,teddy's fine,mags.

10:41.920 --> 10:46.250
We're,uh--we're all here to talk about your problem.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.590
My problem?

10:48.750 --> 10:50.560
Which one?

10:51.060 --> 10:52.550
The drinking.

10:54.930 --> 10:58.260
[Sighs] This is gonna be really fun.

10:59.230 --> 11:03.070
Mags,why don't you,uh,take a seat here next to your husband,

11:03.070 --> 11:05.030
and we'll get started.

11:11.550 --> 11:13.150
Here.

11:15.720 --> 11:18.090
[Clears throat] Sorry,pal.

11:19.530 --> 11:21.800
Maggie,

11:22.340 --> 11:25.490
we just want you to know that everybody is in this room 

11:25.490 --> 11:29.690
because we love you,and we feel that you're slipping away.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.430
Mm-hmm.

11:30.430 --> 11:33.470
And so,you know,if you just take a moment,

11:33.470 --> 11:35.540
we've all written down a couple things,

11:35.540 --> 11:39.510
and we'd like you to just listen with an open mind to some of-- 

11:39.510 --> 11:40.970
Hey,wait a minute.Wait a minute.

11:40.970 --> 11:46.330
Is this one of those,uh--those intervention thingies?

11:49.160 --> 11:51.140
Yeah.

11:51.410 --> 11:53.650
I'll do it.

11:54.770 --> 11:55.550
[Laughs] You'll do it?

11:55.550 --> 11:56.510
Yeah.

11:56.510 --> 11:58.560
I'm tired of this shit.

11:59.150 --> 12:01.590
Wakin' up god knows where with god knows who,

12:01.590 --> 12:03.750
havin' done god knows what,

12:03.750 --> 12:06.990
feelin' like an atomic bomb went off inside my skull.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.770
I'm finished.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.770
Box me up and ship me to rehab.

12:11.770 --> 12:13.770
Ok,you know?

12:13.770 --> 12:15.620
We got you set up at an outpatient facility.

12:15.620 --> 12:16.620
They have counseling there.

12:16.620 --> 12:17.980
You can--
-I'm sorry.I'm sorry.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.110
This-- that's it?

12:19.110 --> 12:19.910
She's just gonna-- 

12:19.910 --> 12:21.540
Well,she said she was gonna do it.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.590
I mean,I'm really proud of you,mags.

12:22.590 --> 12:23.660
That's really incredible.

12:23.660 --> 12:25.120
Excuse me.I have a sta-- 

12:25.120 --> 12:26.700
-What?
-I have a stack of notebooks here.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.490
I'd like to-- to say my piece.

12:28.490 --> 12:29.840
I'm with the kid.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.560
I got grievances to air.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.410
Oh,blow it out of your ass,old man.

12:33.410 --> 12:35.590
I am not gonna give you the satisfaction.

12:35.590 --> 12:36.360
Ok.

12:36.360 --> 12:37.260
You know what?She's not taking this seriously.

12:37.260 --> 12:40.170
She's gonna climb up onto a bar stool 5 minutes after she walks out that door.

12:40.170 --> 12:41.550
I'm not gonna take this seriously?

12:41.550 --> 12:43.160
Oh,I beg to differ.

12:43.160 --> 12:44.830
Watch this,sean.

12:46.240 --> 12:47.340
[Cellphone rings] Yeah.

12:47.340 --> 12:48.290
Ok.

12:48.290 --> 12:49.290
All right.

12:49.290 --> 12:50.110
That's them.

12:50.110 --> 12:52.130
The rhinoceros has landed.

12:56.470 --> 12:57.190
Hey,guys.

12:57.190 --> 12:57.840
Hey.

12:57.840 --> 12:59.300
Hey,everybody.Look who's here.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.460
Hey,teddy.

13:00.460 --> 13:01.700
Hey.

13:01.700 --> 13:02.570
How you all doin'?

13:02.570 --> 13:03.190
Good.

13:03.190 --> 13:05.960
Hey,uh,where's the barbecue?

13:08.770 --> 13:10.990
Are you nuts?

13:11.320 --> 13:14.640
I am very disappointed in you,young lady,very disappointed.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.730
This was my intervention.

13:16.730 --> 13:17.990
Oh,I'm sorry.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.760
But I love the show.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.080
What's goin' on?

13:24.640 --> 13:30.220
Teddy,we just want you to know that everybody is in this room 

13:30.220 --> 13:31.260
because we love you.

13:31.260 --> 13:33.290
We do.

13:33.290 --> 13:37.020
We And we just--we just want to say a couple things to you.

13:37.020 --> 13:39.550
There's no reason to get angry about anything.

13:39.550 --> 13:40.600
No,no,no.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.200
Because-- We wrote letters.

13:42.200 --> 13:43.380
Letters.We have letters.

13:43.380 --> 13:44.390
And notes.

13:44.390 --> 13:45.530
Small.Short.

13:45.530 --> 13:47.790
And we just want you to keep an open mind.

13:47.790 --> 13:50.770
Oh,for christ's sakes!

13:50.770 --> 13:52.860
This is it?

13:52.860 --> 13:54.670
Get out of my way,you goddamn pussies.

13:54.670 --> 14:00.540
Look,you,everybody's in this room because you are acting like a raging asshole,

14:00.540 --> 14:03.220
and you're pissing us off.

14:03.750 --> 14:08.250
You are 57 ye theodore,

14:08.250 --> 14:10.710
and still you behave like a goddamn child.

14:10.710 --> 14:15.070
You take zero responsibility for all the shit you pull to feed your habit.

14:15.070 --> 14:17.350
We are sick of it.

14:17.350 --> 14:21.620
You grow up,or you're gonna lose everybody in this room,

14:21.620 --> 14:23.680
and you're gonna wind up drinkin' yourself to death.

14:23.680 --> 14:26.690
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

14:26.690 --> 14:28.310
Huh?

14:28.710 --> 14:30.870
I'm good.

14:32.310 --> 14:36.500
So,what are you people tryin' to say?

14:37.200 --> 14:39.530
You gotta get off the sauce,teddy.

14:39.530 --> 14:41.730
You gotta quit drinkin'.

14:41.730 --> 14:43.700
This is comin' from you?

14:43.700 --> 14:45.070
Look at this place.

14:45.070 --> 14:46.680
Look at your life.

14:46.680 --> 14:49.540
Does being sober make your life any easier?

14:49.540 --> 14:50.880
Not really,but-- 

14:50.880 --> 14:51.630
Well,there you go.

14:51.630 --> 14:52.950
Hey.Hey.

14:52.950 --> 14:54.950
It's a process,ok?

14:54.950 --> 14:57.060
It's a--you know,one day at a time type of thing.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.120
You do one day at a time,then 2 days,

14:59.120 --> 15:01.850
and turn days into weeks and then weeks into months,

15:01.850 --> 15:07.800
and gradually,slowly,it goes from bein' shitty to bein' good to eventually bein',

15:08.440 --> 15:09.280
uh,great.

15:09.280 --> 15:10.800
Right?

15:10.800 --> 15:12.510
Right.Great.

15:12.510 --> 15:14.460
So what do you say,teddy?

15:14.460 --> 15:16.070
You gonna get some help?

15:16.070 --> 15:17.550
Uh,no.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.070
Aw,goddamn it!

15:19.070 --> 15:20.610
Teddy.

15:20.610 --> 15:21.330
Teddy.

15:21.330 --> 15:22.330
No.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.240
No,no,no,no.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.560
Hey,hey,hey,hey.

15:24.560 --> 15:25.750
Hey,listen to me.

15:25.750 --> 15:26.880
She's right.

15:26.880 --> 15:28.880
You leave now,you go out that door,that's it.

15:28.880 --> 15:29.770
Ah-ah!

15:29.770 --> 15:32.820
Cousins,family,nobody calls you back,ok?

15:32.820 --> 15:34.910
Even if you need help and you call us,we're not callin' you back.

15:34.910 --> 15:36.310
You're done.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.310
[Shudders] Shit!

15:38.310 --> 15:39.320
Can't go back to rehab.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.370
It doesn't work for me!

15:40.370 --> 15:42.290
Good.Then let us help you,teddy.

15:42.290 --> 15:43.770
God.We love you!

15:43.770 --> 15:44.450
Hey-- 
-What?

15:44.450 --> 15:46.580
Everything's a negotiation,right?

15:46.580 --> 15:49.800
Teddy doesn't want to go to rehab,but he does want to get better.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.320
I guess.

15:51.320 --> 15:52.930
Mick,you start takin' him to meetings?

15:52.930 --> 15:53.840
Yeah,sure.

15:53.840 --> 15:56.710
I mean,shit,we got enough drunks in this room 

15:56.710 --> 15:59.830
to start our own meetings.

16:02.850 --> 16:05.290
That's not a bad idea.

16:06.600 --> 16:07.530
There's no reason we can'T.I mean...

16:07.530 --> 16:08.460
No?Right?

16:08.460 --> 16:09.290
Sure.

16:09.290 --> 16:10.560
I'm not a drunk.

16:10.560 --> 16:11.570
Yeah,ok.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.100
We could do it monday,wednesday.

16:13.100 --> 16:14.470
Except I'm not a drunk.

16:14.470 --> 16:17.800
This from a guy who drank a bottle of brandy 

16:17.800 --> 16:20.320
and drove his car into a laundromat.

16:20.320 --> 16:22.800
Yeah,that was 3 years ago,and it was snowing.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.050
Yeah,ok.It was the weather.

16:24.050 --> 16:24.910
Yeah.How 'bout this?

16:24.910 --> 16:26.090
Get your hands out of my-- Yeah,yeah,yeah,yeah.

16:26.090 --> 16:26.780
Ok?

16:26.780 --> 16:29.030
Exhibit "a," folks.

16:30.700 --> 16:32.240
All right,I nip,all right?I nip.

16:32.240 --> 16:33.490
He nips.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.020
But only after 3:00.

16:35.020 --> 16:36.180
Let's take a vote on it,all right?

16:36.180 --> 16:38.070
All those in favor of having a family A.

16:38.070 --> 16:39.570
Meeting 3 times a week say,"aye.

16:39.570 --> 16:40.800
" All: Aye.

16:40.800 --> 16:41.510
All those opposed.

16:41.510 --> 16:43.010
Teddy: Nay.

16:43.010 --> 16:43.820
The ayes have it.

16:43.820 --> 16:46.050
I want a recount.

16:47.190 --> 16:49.410
S saon is cooked to perfection.

16:49.410 --> 16:50.120
Yeah?

16:50.120 --> 16:51.310
I am really impressed.

16:51.310 --> 16:52.610
Well,it's good to hear.

16:52.610 --> 16:53.720
And I wasn't sure I could pull it off.

16:53.720 --> 16:56.380
I never really prepared anything that didn't involve a microwave 

16:56.380 --> 16:58.560
or boiling w you know?

16:58.770 --> 17:00.530
You done good.

17:00.530 --> 17:02.190
Thank you,baby.

17:03.990 --> 17:07.520
So,um,I brought you something.

17:08.290 --> 17:11.020
I was wondering when you were gonna return that.

17:11.020 --> 17:12.599
Yeah.

17:13.150 --> 17:14.550
You know,you were right,sweetheart.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.520
Seeing alicia was the thing to do.

17:16.520 --> 17:18.730
Just made me realize that,um,you know,

17:18.730 --> 17:21.260
I love you more,and you're the one I'm meant to be with.

17:21.260 --> 17:22.349
And now that I got keela back in my life--

17:22.349 --> 17:23.660
 More"?

17:23.660 --> 17:25.950
Yeah.

17:25.950 --> 17:27.150
"More.

17:27.150 --> 17:30.970
" Right.I mean,I love you more than ever.

17:31.580 --> 17:33.830
So you love me more.

17:33.830 --> 17:36.910
No,baby.I love you only.

17:36.910 --> 17:38.580
But--but I mean,how close was it?

17:38.580 --> 17:40.950
Was it--you know,did i beat her by a half length,

17:40.950 --> 17:42.340
or was like a photo finish?

17:42.340 --> 17:44.640
Nat,it's done,ok?

17:44.640 --> 17:45.980
You're the one.

17:45.980 --> 17:46.990
This is good news,sweetheart.

17:46.990 --> 17:48.960
Please,just-- just take the ring back.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.350
No.

17:50.350 --> 17:52.330
You take it back.

17:52.740 --> 17:54.460
Take all your shit with you while you're at it.

17:54.460 --> 17:56.110
Don't--don't do this.

17:56.110 --> 17:59.260
Nat,you're the one who told me to go see her,ok?

17:59.260 --> 18:01.130
We just agreed honesty is the best policy,right?

18:01.130 --> 18:02.280
I was wrong.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.240
Baby,don'T.

18:03.240 --> 18:04.120
No,no,no.

18:04.120 --> 18:06.750
I am not your baby anymore.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.300
I'm gonna take a long walk.

18:09.300 --> 18:11.740
You be gone when I get back.

18:12.660 --> 18:14.990
Baby,I...

19:22.290 --> 19:24.030
What's this?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.990

19:48.380 --> 19:49.620
They're gonna take care of that.

19:49.620 --> 19:53.050
Good exterminator to get rid of these gnats or flying ants.

19:53.050 --> 19:54.130

19:54.130 --> 19:55.590
And you know what?I know great movers.

19:55.590 --> 19:56.420
We'll get this ratty old couch-- 

19:56.420 --> 19:57.890
Yeah,the couch stays.Thank you very much.

19:57.890 --> 20:00.650
Oh.Well,are you sure?Because--ok.Well.

20:38.020 --> 20:39.360
Turn the music down.

20:39.360 --> 20:41.340
Why don't you mind your own business?

20:41.820 --> 20:45.750
[Turns off music] Why don't you buy some goddamn headphones,ok?

20:45.750 --> 20:47.500
Or put the goddamn windows up.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.150
Show some respect for your neighbors.

20:50.150 --> 20:51.870
What are you lookin' at?

20:55.640 --> 20:57.620
Thank you.

21:21.850 --> 21:23.450
Wouldn't want to be a cop today,huh?

21:23.450 --> 21:26.190
Yeah,I wouldn't want to be a cop on any day,especially not today.

21:26.190 --> 21:28.050
Gavin's gonna be on fire out there.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.390
They better be packin' under their uniforms.

21:29.390 --> 21:31.490
They're gonna get slaughtered out there.

21:34.260 --> 21:37.490
[Cheering] Yo,am I goin' colorblind,or is that tommy gavin wearin' a blue uniform?

21:37.490 --> 21:38.430
Shawn: Damn.

21:38.430 --> 21:40.150
That's messed up,yo.

21:40.150 --> 21:42.520
Lk,let's not judgment,boys,all right?

21:42.520 --> 21:44.070
I mean,the guy's trying to honor his dead brother.

21:44.070 --> 21:47.260
Yeah.Let's hope he makes it through the game without joining him.

21:48.090 --> 21:49.550
He's got some balls,eh?

21:49.550 --> 21:51.000
You ain't kiddin'.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.170
Hey,guys,show a little respect.

21:53.170 --> 21:55.950
If the situation was reversed and it was my brother who got killed,

21:55.950 --> 21:58.900
I'd be doin' the same goddamn thing tommy's doin'.

21:58.900 --> 22:01.650
Hey,mungo,soon as the puck drops,

22:01.650 --> 22:04.220
I want you to rip gavin's goddamn head off.

22:04.220 --> 22:06.490
You got it,coach.

22:08.960 --> 22:11.110
Am I the only one who's confused about who to root for now?

22:11.110 --> 22:12.650
No.

22:12.650 --> 22:14.080
Good.

22:17.820 --> 22:20.410
[Cheering] Oh,yes!

22:20.410 --> 22:21.930
Sorry.

22:24.500 --> 22:28.810
Mungo,will you knock gavin on his goddamn ass,please?

22:30.180 --> 22:31.530
Come on!

22:31.530 --> 22:35.230
Ok,you know,now I'm startin' to feel a little weird about this whole thing.

22:40.580 --> 22:41.360
[Cellphone rings] Hey,mikey.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.990
Where you at,man?

22:42.990 --> 22:46.630
I-I'm home,I'm just sittin' around.

22:46.630 --> 22:48.490
What's a matter,man?You sound a little whacked.

22:48.490 --> 22:53.710
Aw,just drinking some vodka,and I was poppin' some of the pills the doc gave me.

22:53.710 --> 22:56.940
Hey,you wanna come over after the g-game and hang out?

22:56.940 --> 22:57.930
Uh,I don't know.You think you'll still be conscious?

23:00.220 --> 23:01.110
Maybe.

23:01.110 --> 23:02.310
Yeah,I don't think so,man.

23:02.310 --> 23:03.260
Uh,I got all my stuff in shawn's car.

23:03.260 --> 23:05.140
We gotta drop it by his place.

23:05.140 --> 23:05.960
Black shawn?

23:05.960 --> 23:08.020
Yeah.Nat kicked me o 

23:08.020 --> 23:10.430
So you're--you're movin' in with him?

23:10.430 --> 23:11.110
Yeah.

23:11.110 --> 23:14.420
Why didn't you just come and crash with me,bro?

23:14.420 --> 23:15.440
Well,you know,to be honest,mikey,

23:15.440 --> 23:17.330
I really didn't think you want any houseguests after the whole,

23:17.330 --> 23:19.330
you know,garrity thing.Don't take it personal,bro.

23:19.330 --> 23:21.930
How the hell am I supposed to take it,frank?

23:21.930 --> 23:23.790
I mean,I've known you 6 years,and--

23:23.790 --> 23:26.530
and you don't have the decency to hit me up for a place to crash?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.990
What kind of selfish prick are you?

23:28.990 --> 23:30.010
Mikey,I just-- 

23:30.010 --> 23:31.730
Aw,never mind.

23:31.730 --> 23:34.530
Have fun with black shawn,asshole.

23:37.840 --> 23:39.290
How's he doin'?

23:39.290 --> 23:41.400
Still gay.

23:48.780 --> 23:51.040
[Cheering] [Whistle] Oh,yes!

Sorry.

23:54.030 --> 23:55.990
Yeah,enjoy it while you can,tommy.

23:55.990 --> 23:58.630
Enjoy it while you can.

24:03.230 --> 24:05.920
Not exactly what I had in mind,asshole!

24:05.920 --> 24:09.320
Hey,shithead,I'm gonna go to the head of the league about this.

24:09.320 --> 24:10.500
You can't just take a guy like that--

24:10.500 --> 24:13.870
 What are you gonna do,call the goddamn cops?

24:15.930 --> 24:16.550

Packing.

24:45.640 --> 24:47.880
You're not staying?

24:49.260 --> 24:51.740
I can't be around you right now.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.480

I don't feel right around you,sean.

24:57.460 --> 24:58.290
Really?

24:58.290 --> 24:59.810
Is that why every time we get close,

24:59.810 --> 25:02.230
you get that look on your face like I'm coming after you with a goddamn hammer?

25:02.230 --> 25:03.990
Well,you know what?You might as well be.

25:03.990 --> 25:07.090
There's all this pressure around you to do to do the right thing.

25:07.090 --> 25:09.330
Well,it's just too heavy,and it makes me wanna drink.

25:09.330 --> 25:11.590

No,no,no.I didn't take a note.She just-- 

27:35.030 --> 27:36.640
You should have thrown it away,should have torn it up.

costello?

28:19.730 --> 28:21.420
The baby!

28:21.780 --> 28:25.050
You named him elvis,like elvis elvis?

28:25.050 --> 28:26.400
Kind of a bad omen,don't you think?

28:26.400 --> 28:27.880
Katy came over to the apartment,

28:27.880 --> 28:29.680
and she said that you were parking the car,

28:29.680 --> 28:33.010

28:33.010 --> 28:35.870
that lunatic janet is driving away with him!

28:35.870 --> 28:37.690

28:55.170 --> 28:56.740
[Sirens] [Indistinct radio dispatch] Transmit a second alarm.

28:56.740 --> 28:59.420
We got people in the fire on the second and third floors.

28:59.420 --> 29:00.880
What do we got?

29:00.880 --> 29:04.270
We tried to get people out,but we can't access the interior 

29:04.270 --> 29:06.950
until we get a lot more water on that fire.

29:06.950 --> 29:08.740
I'll send 62 truck above.

29:08.740 --> 29:09.910

29:44.620 --> 29:46.490

30:01.270 --> 30:02.730

30:05.440 --> 30:07.350
***Over here.

Nobody else in there,boys.

30:49.770 --> 30:50.830

-Yeah?

30:50.830 --> 30:53.080
What the hell's that crap you pulled back there,huh?

30:53.080 --> 30:54.140
I had an instinct.

30:54.140 --> 30:55.860
I-- Listen,I run this crew by the book,

30:55.860 --> 30:59.360
and I don't need some goddamn rogue fireman runnin' around,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.600
thinkin' he's steve mcqueen,putting these guys' lives in jeopardy.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.040
There are rules on this job.

31:04.040 --> 31:06.210
I know there are rules,and sometimes the rules are meant to be broken.

31:06.210 --> 31:07.310
That's how you get things done.

31:07.310 --> 31:11.590
Jack donohue in rego park,may 5,1968.

31:11.590 --> 31:14.790
He had an i he had a gut,took his friend with him,

31:14.790 --> 31:17.800
And they're buried side by side in maple grove.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.570
Hey,listen-- Listen,I've seen death wish schmucks like you gettin' people seared,

31:21.570 --> 31:23.930

31:23.930 --> 31:25.550
Hey,I didn't ask anybody to come in after me.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.230
You don't have to.

31:26.230 --> 31:27.160
Everybody's got a gut.

31:27.160 --> 31:29.320
Well,I tell you one thing.Jerry used to like when I did this.

31:29.320 --> 31:30.610
Just keep it up,ok?

31:30.610 --> 31:32.980
You'll be discussing it with jerry real soon.

31:32.980 --> 31:34.560
What are you guys lookin' at?

31:34.560 --> 31:36.650

Hey,uh--ahem.

-Promise you're not gonna be mad.

31:44.130 --> 31:44.930
Not gonna be mad.

31:44.930 --> 31:46.540
All right,you're not gonna-- promise you're not gonna hit me.

31:46.540 --> 31:47.700
I promise I'm not gonna hit you.

31:47.700 --> 31:48.300
Promise.

31:48.300 --> 31:48.960
Ok.I promise.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.070

31:50.080 --> 31:54.160
Uh,who is steve mcqueen again?

32:18.700 --> 32:21.710
Hey,uh,you sure it's not better if you just go in there and talk to him alone,lou?

32:21.710 --> 32:22.950
I-- No,no.

32:22.950 --> 32:26.020
I mean,tommy's skatin' on thin ice already with this guy.

32:26.020 --> 32:28.010
I think it's better,to,you know--

Uh,I forgot.

You know,we forgot,chief.

We'll just come back later.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.210
Right.Right.

33:11.570 --> 33:15.670

33:16.360 --> 33:18.760

33:22.590 --> 33:27.310
[Sputters] And you know,of course he has to be a free-baller.

33:29.180 --> 33:30.130
[Line rings] Janet: Hello.

33:30.130 --> 33:31.280
I know you took the baby.

33:31.280 --> 33:32.680
Yeah,my baby.

33:32.680 --> 33:33.440
Wyatt.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.840

33:34.840 --> 33:36.810

33:36.810 --> 33:37.460
Oh,jesus christ.You know what?

33:37.460 --> 33:39.990
You're takin' the costner thing just a little bit too goddamn far now.

33:39.990 --> 33:42.190
You're lucky I didn't name him dances with wolves.

33:42.190 --> 33:44.500
Why don't you just call him kevin,for christ's sake?

33:44.500 --> 33:45.690
'Cause it's too on the nose.

33:45.690 --> 33:47.400
Yeah,too on the nose.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.030
You know,he's like 60 and bald now.

33:50.030 --> 33:51.500
You know that,right?

33:51.500 --> 33:53.670
Look,he's 60,sexy,and bald.

33:53.670 --> 33:54.770
What do you want?

33:54.770 --> 33:57.270
[Wyatt crying] Yeah,the baby seems real happy about the wyatt earp thing.

33:57.270 --> 33:59.010
Look,he's just hungry.

33:59.010 --> 34:00.730
Yeah.Where are you?

34:00.730 --> 34:02.030
In a hotel.

34:02.030 --> 34:03.560
Why don't you run down to the vending machines 

34:03.560 --> 34:06.280
and see if they have a couple cans of similac in there for him,huh?

34:06.280 --> 34:08.190
Let me tell you something.You want the money for katy and colleen,

34:08.190 --> 34:09.830
you gotta give the baby back to sheila.

34:09.830 --> 34:12.989
Yeah,speaking of which,I need some money soon.

34:12.989 --> 34:14.550
Hey,no baby,no money.

34:14.550 --> 34:16.070
That's the way it works,you understand?

34:16.070 --> 34:17.250
No,no,no.

34:17.250 --> 34:18.940
I keep the baby,and you give me money.

34:18.940 --> 34:20.360
That's how it works.

34:20.360 --> 34:21.600
Really?

34:21.600 --> 34:23.449
Ok,keep livin' in fantasyland.

34:23.449 --> 34:25.400
Put my daughter on the phone.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.770
No.

34:32.030 --> 34:32.920
[Cellphone rings] Yeah.

34:32.920 --> 34:34.070
It's mike.

34:34.070 --> 34:35.219
I need to talk to you.

34:35.219 --> 34:36.570
Go ahead.Shoot.

34:36.570 --> 34:37.760
In person.

34:37.760 --> 34:39.780
Mikey,I don't have that kind of time right now.

34:39.780 --> 34:40.889
What's goin' on?

34:40.889 --> 34:42.340
I'm cracking up over here.

34:42.340 --> 34:43.830
I--I don't know what to do,man.

34:43.830 --> 34:45.219
I'm havin' really bad thoughts.

Repeat that back to me.

34:55.909 --> 34:58.560

35:27.490 --> 35:31.700
I-- I was drinkin',and I panicked,and,um,I called you.

35:31.700 --> 35:32.760

35:32.760 --> 35:34.330
I'm--I'm sorry.I got a little scared.

35:34.330 --> 35:35.880
You all right?

35:35.880 --> 35:37.970
I'm--yeah.I'm fine.

35:37.970 --> 35:39.710

35:44.670 --> 35:46.240

35:46.240 --> 35:47.990
How many percocets did you take?

35:47.990 --> 35:48.980
Uh,I don't know.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.720
Whatever was left,like 3.

35:50.720 --> 35:51.640
3?

35:51.640 --> 35:52.770
Yeah.

35:52.770 --> 35:55.680
What's--what's goin' on with your ass?

35:55.680 --> 35:59.090
Uh,I--I cut myself.

35:59.670 --> 36:02.140
Ok,I don't wanna monday morning quarterback you here,

36:02.140 --> 36:03.720
but you know,if you're trying to commit suicide,

36:03.720 --> 36:05.330
you're supposed to cut your wrists,not your ass.

36:05.330 --> 36:06.520
Yeah,I know.

36:06.520 --> 36:12.720
I-I've just been,um,like,takin' these pills,you know,and--

36:14.910 --> 36:17.830
and they got my head kind of,like,messed up,

36:17.830 --> 36:20.310
and I was thinkin' about my mom and the chief and-- 

36:20.310 --> 36:23.000
and I got--thinkin' these crazy thoughts.

36:23.000 --> 36:24.030
But I'm all good.

Open the door,mike.

36:59.260 --> 37:00.610
Leave me alone.

37:00.610 --> 37:02.370
You want me to knock the goddamn door down?

37:02.370 --> 37:03.720
Is that what you want?

37:03.720 --> 37:06.100
No.Just go.

37:06.500 --> 37:07.490
Mike.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.360

37:22.550 --> 37:25.000

37:29.280 --> 37:32.200
[Door closes] Tom?

37:32.200 --> 37:34.300
You still here?

37:41.460 --> 37:43.500
Tom?

37:52.630 --> 37:54.390
Let's go.Come on.

37:54.390 --> 37:55.970
Hey,what are you doin'?

37:55.970 --> 37:57.660

37:59.270 --> 38:00.270
Show me where you were gonna jump,mikey.

38:00.270 --> 38:01.490
Tommy,I just wanna go downstairs.

38:01.490 --> 38:03.310
Show me where you were gonna jump.

38:03.310 --> 38:04.340
I'm not--tommy.

38:04.340 --> 38:05.870
At this side?Huh?Over here?

38:05.870 --> 38:07.260
Huh?

38:07.260 --> 38:08.410
Is that it?

38:08.410 --> 38:09.220
Take a look!

38:09.220 --> 38:11.020
Take a look,mike!Take a look!

38:11.020 --> 38:12.150

38:13.570 --> 38:14.730
Come on.You're scarin' me.

38:14.730 --> 38:16.150
Yeah?

38:16.150 --> 38:18.150
That's the whole idea.

38:18.150 --> 38:19.210
Come on.

38:19.210 --> 38:20.560
Take a drink.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.890
Tom,come on.I just wanna sit down.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.220
Pussy.

38:27.220 --> 38:29.390
Come--come on.

38:29.390 --> 38:31.140
You don't have to do this.

38:31.140 --> 38:32.410
It's cool,man.I'm good now.

38:32.410 --> 38:35.860
I told you,I-- I just--I came up here for some fresh air,you know?

38:35.860 --> 38:41.230
I'm--I'm-- you know,I mean,my mom and everything.

38:42.550 --> 38:44.140
[Sputters] It's cool,tom.

38:44.140 --> 38:45.500
Just...

38:51.800 --> 38:54.900
can we just go back down?

39:03.250 --> 39:05.440
Got a smoke,kid?

39:06.930 --> 39:07.560
Yeah?

39:07.560 --> 39:08.730
Yeah.

39:08.730 --> 39:10.750
Aw,boy.

39:17.990 --> 39:20.310
Got a light?

39:24.040 --> 39:26.480
Aw,boy.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.720
Thanks.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.380
You're welcome.

39:35.320 --> 39:37.670
Aw,it's been a while.

39:41.110 --> 39:46.930
Well--[Clears throat] Kid...

39:50.560 --> 39:53.100
gotta look at the bright side.

39:55.170 --> 40:00.030
Least your mom died before you did,you know.

40:00.030 --> 40:04.420
I mean,that's,uh,natural course of events,you know.

40:05.240 --> 40:07.370
Know what I'm sayin'?

40:08.890 --> 40:10.420
Parents are supposed to die before their kids.

40:10.420 --> 40:16.340
That was one of the things that was so screwed up about 9/11,you know.

40:17.430 --> 40:24.400
All these guys doin' the right thing,dyin',parents havin' to bury 'em.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.240
It's not right.

40:27.800 --> 40:30.090
Besides,I'm sure your mom was a pain in the ass half the time anyways.

40:30.090 --> 40:34.460
Half the times she probably called you,you probably looked at your phone and 

40:34.460 --> 40:38.070
let it go to voice mail,right,'cause you didn't wanna talk to her.

40:42.070 --> 40:46.450
Much as I love my wife,same thing,man.

40:46.450 --> 40:49.850
Sometimes,you know,we'd separate,

40:49.850 --> 40:53.040
arrange the schedule so we didn't have to see each other,

40:53.040 --> 40:55.210
except in passing for a couple weeks at a time.

40:55.210 --> 41:00.960
And then,you know,you see 'em for a couple hours,and,you know,

41:00.960 --> 41:04.920
you start to get all those great feelings back.

41:04.920 --> 41:08.090
Then a couple days later,you hate 'em again.

41:10.580 --> 41:13.300
But at least she died before you did.

41:14.770 --> 41:21.140
'Cause I'll tell you what,there's nothin' worse than buryin' your kid.

41:21.950 --> 41:24.330
I did it,you know.

41:28.360 --> 41:31.390
Remember after 9/11 when they found jimmy,what was it,like,

41:31.390 --> 41:36.690
3 weeks later when they pulled his body out.

41:37.040 --> 41:38.820
And after the funeral,

41:40.380 --> 41:45.430
we were havin' a party,whatever,

41:45.430 --> 41:47.840
and my aunt bridie,his mother,has havin' a rough time,

41:47.840 --> 41:53.290
and my cousin noreen,his sister,was tryin' to help her along,

41:53.290 --> 41:58.560
and she said,"you know,ma,the only thing that's really gonna make this go away is time.

41:59.770 --> 42:01.450
" I'll never forget what my aunt bridie said.

42:01.450 --> 42:05.570
She said,"I'm 77 years old.

42:05.570 --> 42:08.230
I don't have enough time.

42:11.490 --> 42:13.610
" It's the truth.

42:13.610 --> 42:18.860
I could live to be 106.I'm not gonna get over connor.

42:20.420 --> 42:22.320
And he was a real pain in the ass that mornin'.

42:22.320 --> 42:24.960
He was ridin' that bike in and out in between cars.

42:24.960 --> 42:27.350
You know,I was tryin' to fix the truck.

42:31.390 --> 42:35.620
But I got 2 healthy kids.

42:37.390 --> 42:41.440
Whatever else I say about my wife,she's been a great mother,you know?

42:44.260 --> 42:47.290
Lot to be said for that,you know?

42:48.190 --> 42:50.440
A lot.

42:53.390 --> 42:54.520
Hey,do me a favor,will you?

42:54.520 --> 42:57.500
Step on that for me.

42:58.170 --> 42:58.810
You got it?

42:58.810 --> 43:00.550
Yeah.

43:16.900 --> 43:18.860
It was water,asshole.

43:18.860 --> 43:22.290
Jesus christ.You scared the shit out of me.

43:24.960 --> 43:26.170
This building ain't up to code.

43:26.170 --> 43:27.220
You ok?

43:27.220 --> 43:29.540
Yeah,fine.

43:29.540 --> 43:31.010

43:43.470 --> 43:45.340
Ok.

43:45.570 --> 43:47.830
Shit.

43:49.310 --> 43:51.290
Our father who art in heaven,hallowed be thy name.

43:51.290 --> 43:53.660
Thy kingdom come.Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

43:53.660 --> 43:55.950
Give us this day our daily bread 

43:55.950 --> 44:00.310

44:00.650 --> 44:04.800
Lead us not into temptation,but deliver us from evil.Amen.
