NARRATOR: Which had
consequences for Jose.

00:32.066 --> 00:32.860
Trevor.

00:32.963 --> 00:34.310
This isn't going to define me.

00:34.413 --> 00:36.691
But damned if I'm
not disappointed.

00:36.795 --> 00:39.177
NARRATOR: Despite the men'sbest efforts to make up ground--

00:39.280 --> 00:40.281

the women indulged

01:01.164 --> 01:02.683
in an afternoon of pampering--

01:02.786 --> 01:04.478
It feels so good
to keep on winning.

01:04.581 --> 01:07.515
NARRATOR: Trevor spent theafternoon beating himself up.

01:07.619 --> 01:08.516
I've got to have the palate.

01:16.628 --> 01:17.801

be plated better.

01:17.905 --> 01:18.699
Tell me that then.

01:18.802 --> 01:19.838
I did tell you that.

01:19.941 --> 01:21.150
NARRATOR: But the blue
team still served up

01:21.253 --> 01:23.807
a smooth service to

[inaudible]

Trevor a much-needed boost.

01:28.709 --> 01:29.537
Trevor.

01:29.641 --> 01:30.780
Best-executed course so far.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.919
Up and out.

01:32.022 --> 01:33.576
NARRATOR: But it all
came crashing to a halt.

01:33.679 --> 01:34.508
Oh my gosh.

01:34.611 --> 01:35.992
Mine is completely raw.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.132

sent out raw veal.

01:40.824 --> 01:41.791
No.

No, no, no, no, no.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.278
NARRATOR: The red
team clearly lost.

01:46.382 --> 01:47.831
And nominated--
- Jose.

01:47.935 --> 01:48.729
NARRATOR: And--

01:48.832 --> 01:49.868
Me, chef.

01:49.971 --> 01:52.042
I got more fight in
me than anybody here.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.079
NARRATOR: Ultimately,
Chef Ramsay eliminated--

01:54.183 --> 01:55.460
GORDON RAMSAY: Jose.

NARRATOR: Ending his dreamsof becoming the executive chef

01:58.221 --> 02:00.396
at Gordon Ramsay'sHell's Kitchen restaurant

02:00.499 --> 02:03.882
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas.

02:03.985 --> 02:06.126
Now, the continuation
of "Hell's Kitchen."

02:06.229 --> 02:07.023
Piss off.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.404
Yes, chef.

02:08.507 --> 02:10.233
You know, for Trevor to saythat he's the most determined

02:10.337 --> 02:12.062
guy here, that's nonsense.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.099
I should have just took
that station over, dog.

02:14.203 --> 02:17.275
I bleed determination.

02:17.378 --> 02:18.828
You definitely don't
got the most drive.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.312
We all got that drive, homie.

02:20.416 --> 02:21.796
Trev's about the
glory right now,

02:21.900 --> 02:23.350
and not necessarily the team.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.835
Obviously, Chef Ramsay thinksthat you're better than Jose.

02:25.938 --> 02:28.527
So you know, there must
be a reason for that.

02:28.631 --> 02:30.529
I have a feeling thatBrett wanted me gone tonight.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.461
Whatever.

02:31.565 --> 02:32.704
But I don't give up.

02:32.807 --> 02:34.947
Because that's the ultimateinsult to Gordon Ramsay.

02:35.051 --> 02:36.811
Honestly, bro, I feel likeafter today's challenge,

02:36.915 --> 02:38.882
you was crumbling with theshaky hands and mad nervous.

02:38.986 --> 02:41.368
But moving forward, yo,got to be on one page, bro.

02:41.471 --> 02:43.542
No more of this he say, she say,pointing fingers and all that,

02:43.646 --> 02:44.957
bro.

02:45.061 --> 02:46.338
[music playing]

02:46.442 --> 02:47.270
Cool.

02:47.374 --> 02:48.409
Silence is golden.

02:48.513 --> 02:50.515
I feel like Trevor will
eventually take himself

02:50.618 --> 02:51.619
out of this competition.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.000
Motto, you know, he's
a good cook and all,

02:53.103 --> 02:54.553
but I don't think
he has what it takes

02:54.657 --> 02:56.037
to make it to that next level.

02:56.141 --> 02:59.179
And I feel like I do.

02:59.282 --> 03:01.733
Silence is golden.

03:01.836 --> 03:03.700
[theme music]

03:34.662 --> 03:37.009
[music playing]

03:37.113 --> 03:38.597
Good morning, Hell's Kitchen.

03:38.701 --> 03:39.633
How are you today?

03:39.736 --> 03:40.565
Oh, I'm fine.

03:40.668 --> 03:41.531
Thanks for asking.

03:41.635 --> 03:42.946
Oh, shit.

03:43.050 --> 03:44.189
Let me tell you.

03:44.293 --> 03:48.124
The roads are backed upfrom here to Santa Monica.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.022
And it doesn't really matter,because we won't be getting

03:50.126 --> 03:51.438
outside anytime soon today.

03:51.541 --> 03:54.199
So I hear the weather isshitty, but again, we wouldn't

03:54.303 --> 03:55.165
know anything about that.

03:55.269 --> 03:57.271
So back to you at HK station.

03:57.375 --> 03:58.376
Trev, how you
doing this morning?

03:58.479 --> 03:59.273
This sucks.

03:59.377 --> 04:00.240
[phone ringing]

04:00.343 --> 04:01.793
Good morning.
This is Trevor.

04:01.896 --> 04:03.001
Yeah.
Good morning, Trevor.

04:03.104 --> 04:04.554
I need all of you downstairsimmediately, please.

04:04.658 --> 04:05.969
Thank you.
- Yes, chef.

04:06.073 --> 04:06.867
Come on.

04:06.970 --> 04:07.799
Immediately.

04:07.902 --> 04:10.180
[music playing]

04:13.114 --> 04:16.635
What the fuck, man?

04:16.739 --> 04:18.396
Yeah, I don't know
what's going on.

04:18.499 --> 04:19.880
GORDON RAMSAY: As you
can see, Hell's Kitchen

04:19.983 --> 04:21.433
has yet again frozen over.

04:21.537 --> 04:22.986
Uh, yeah.
No, thanks.

04:23.090 --> 04:23.884
I don't do ice skating.

04:23.987 --> 04:25.782
Or ice dancing, or ice anything.

04:25.886 --> 04:26.956
I live in South Florida.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.302
GORDON RAMSAY: Of all
the Olympic sports,

04:28.406 --> 04:31.581
ice dancing is truly
the most romantic.

04:31.685 --> 04:34.757
Ice dancing is real sensual.

04:34.860 --> 04:36.552
[music playing]

04:36.655 --> 04:38.381
GORDON RAMSAY: Motto, do
you ever get romantic?

04:38.485 --> 04:40.038
I try to at least once a day.

04:40.141 --> 04:41.211
[laughter]

04:41.315 --> 04:42.420
Once a day.

04:42.523 --> 04:44.905
That's what I'm
talking about, Motto.

04:45.008 --> 04:46.596
OK, good.

04:46.700 --> 04:49.323
Similar to ice dancing,
in the culinary world,

04:49.427 --> 04:52.395
there's nothing
more romantic than--

04:52.499 --> 04:54.224
Dessert, chef?

04:54.328 --> 04:55.122
[laughter]

04:55.225 --> 04:56.019
Dessert.

04:56.123 --> 04:57.642
They pulled out a cupcake.

04:57.745 --> 04:59.368
Yeah, I mean, that's
pretty romantic.

04:59.471 --> 05:01.749
You want that treat, thatexcitement at the end.

05:01.853 --> 05:03.441
GORDON RAMSAY: Great to see you.Gorgeous sequence.

05:03.544 --> 05:04.442
Thank you.

05:04.545 --> 05:05.788
Dessert takes a
little bit of finesse.

05:05.891 --> 05:07.134
You know what I mean?

05:07.237 --> 05:09.378
It puts you in the mood forthe after-dinner get down.

05:09.481 --> 05:11.587
For today's
challenge, each of you

05:11.690 --> 05:15.660
will be creating onespectacular, delicious dessert.

05:15.763 --> 05:18.248
Your 60 minutes starts now.

05:18.352 --> 05:19.146
Let's go.

05:19.249 --> 05:21.079
[music playing]

05:23.599 --> 05:24.703
- Time to make the donuts?- Yeah.

05:24.807 --> 05:25.877
Time to make the doughnuts.- OK.

05:25.980 --> 05:27.119
Let's do it.

05:27.223 --> 05:29.087
Taking one of my favoritedesserts, bread pudding,

05:29.190 --> 05:31.434
and putting a little spin on it.

05:31.538 --> 05:33.229
[music playing]

05:33.333 --> 05:35.473
The best part of wakingup is cognac in your cup.

05:35.576 --> 05:36.819
Brett, what are you doing?

05:36.922 --> 05:38.579
I'm doing a white chocolateorange zest cognac arancini.

05:38.683 --> 05:41.099
A play on Italian creamy.

05:41.202 --> 05:42.238
Yes.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.205
Because you can't do
spaghetti in a dessert.

05:44.309 --> 05:46.725
Oh, again, with the Italian.

05:46.829 --> 05:48.520
Who the fuck are
you, Rocky Balboa?

05:48.624 --> 05:50.280
Let's, like, shake
it up a little bit.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.800
I mean, even he went onand did "The Expendables."

05:52.904 --> 05:54.388
Because you can't
make spaghetti dessert.

05:54.492 --> 05:55.700
Finger foods, to me, are sexy.

05:55.803 --> 05:57.322
You know, when you canfeed the person, you know,

05:57.426 --> 05:58.427
that you're in love with.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.325
You get to licking the
fingers and whatnot.

06:00.429 --> 06:03.017
We know what can
come after that.

06:03.121 --> 06:03.984
[music playing]

06:04.087 --> 06:05.261
What are you making, Kanae?

06:05.365 --> 06:08.022
I'm making Luxardo
cherry tiramisu.

06:08.126 --> 06:09.852
But I'm going to do a
deconstructed version.

06:09.955 --> 06:12.061
I want to make everythingfrom scratch right now.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.925
I want to show Chef
Ramsay that I am

06:14.028 --> 06:16.548
really good at making desserts.

06:16.652 --> 06:18.688
Shit.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.069
Avocado mousse is done.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.864
I got my meringue working.

06:21.967 --> 06:25.661
Everything in my dish todayis actually a superfood.

06:25.764 --> 06:26.731
The goji berries.

06:26.834 --> 06:28.836
Not only does it taste
good and decadent,

06:28.940 --> 06:31.321
but it really is good for you.

06:31.425 --> 06:32.219
I'd order that.

06:35.153 --> 06:36.465
Um.

06:36.568 --> 06:38.950
I think Trev might be gettinga little overconfident.

06:39.053 --> 06:39.847
That's rich.

06:42.298 --> 06:43.644
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's
go, let's go, let's go.

06:43.748 --> 06:47.441
Bread pudding is the mostsought-after comfort food.

06:47.545 --> 06:48.580
I put the whiskey in.

06:48.684 --> 06:50.099
I just want to know if
I should go more or not.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.721
It's not hot.

06:51.825 --> 06:55.345
The whiskey is
like, so potent.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.244
You might want to cookthat out just a little bit.

06:57.347 --> 07:00.178
I think Heather right
now is a little tipsy.

07:03.319 --> 07:04.562
Fuck.

07:04.665 --> 07:05.770
GORDON RAMSAY: What, what'swrong with the [inaudible]??

07:05.873 --> 07:07.254
- It crumbled, chef.
- It crumbled?

07:07.357 --> 07:07.910
All right.
That's fine.

07:08.013 --> 07:09.014
No worry, no worry.

07:09.118 --> 07:10.947
If you screw upsomething that you baked,

07:11.051 --> 07:13.191
it's not that easy to fix.

07:13.294 --> 07:14.641
Uh.

07:14.744 --> 07:16.263
The way I'm going to
salvage this plating

07:16.366 --> 07:18.645
is by deconstructing it.

07:18.748 --> 07:20.301
GORDON RAMSAY: 60 seconds to go.Come on.

07:20.405 --> 07:21.199
Let's go.

07:21.302 --> 07:23.373
The fastest hour ever.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.824
Everyone's got their
plates organized, yeah?

07:25.928 --> 07:27.412
Yes, chef.

07:27.516 --> 07:30.311
GORDON RAMSAY: 30 seconds to go.

07:30.415 --> 07:32.313
[music playing]

07:32.417 --> 07:33.487
Nice.

07:33.591 --> 07:34.384
Let's go.

07:34.488 --> 07:36.110
Trev, you good.

07:36.214 --> 07:37.353
Beautiful.

07:37.457 --> 07:40.149
GORDON RAMSAY: 10,
9, 8, young lady--

07:40.252 --> 07:41.081
You got it, Ariel.

07:41.184 --> 07:46.466
GORDON RAMSAY: 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

07:46.569 --> 07:47.363
And stop.

07:51.125 --> 07:52.437
Blue team.

07:52.541 --> 07:54.715
You have one more chef onyour team than the red team.

07:54.819 --> 07:56.752
This is a three on
three competition.

07:56.855 --> 07:59.651
So ladies, turn around, cometo consensus on which one

07:59.755 --> 08:00.687
you're going to drop.

08:00.790 --> 08:03.068
Hurry up.

08:03.172 --> 08:04.760
It's between these two.GORDON RAMSAY: Speak it out.

08:04.863 --> 08:05.830
[inaudible]

08:05.933 --> 08:08.142
Based on presentation,
I would say yours.

08:08.246 --> 08:09.316
I tasted it.

08:09.419 --> 08:10.524
I think it's going to
be sweet on top of sweet

08:10.628 --> 08:11.594
on top of sweet.

08:11.698 --> 08:13.251
I feel like thebrittle's a little clunky.

08:13.354 --> 08:15.874
[music playing]

08:15.978 --> 08:17.876
So basically, mine's out.

08:17.980 --> 08:18.774
OK.

08:18.877 --> 08:19.913
Whatever.

08:20.016 --> 08:21.190
I'm not happy about that.

08:21.293 --> 08:23.123
Heather looks really
pissed right now.

08:23.226 --> 08:24.469
But I don't care.

08:24.573 --> 08:27.230
Because I personally
tasted Heather's dish.

08:27.334 --> 08:28.818
And I don't like it.

08:28.922 --> 08:29.716
GORDON RAMSAY: Heather.

08:29.819 --> 08:30.855
Was it a tough decision?

08:30.958 --> 08:32.650
Apparently not, chef,
for the other three.

08:32.753 --> 08:33.858
We're dropping
the bread pudding?

08:33.961 --> 08:34.928
Mmhm.

08:35.031 --> 08:35.963
GORDON RAMSAY: That
sounded delicious.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.309
Thank you, chef.
I know it did.

08:37.413 --> 08:38.448
Karma's a bitch, ladies.

08:38.552 --> 08:39.691
And you better hope
it doesn't come

08:39.795 --> 08:41.624
back to bite you in the ass.

08:41.728 --> 08:43.315
GORDON RAMSAY: For
this test, I've

08:43.419 --> 08:46.180
brought in one of the top,award-winning chocolatiers

08:46.284 --> 08:47.354
in the country.

08:47.457 --> 08:50.875
She owns two incredibly
popular cafes.

08:50.978 --> 08:54.085
Please welcome Chef
Valerie Gordon.

08:54.188 --> 08:56.570
[applause]

08:56.674 --> 08:57.467
Valerie Gordon, man.

08:57.571 --> 08:58.848
She's bad ass.

08:58.952 --> 09:00.988
She's the creme de la
creme of chocolatiers.

09:01.092 --> 09:02.127
- So nice to see you.
- How are you?

09:02.231 --> 09:03.197
[inaudible]

09:03.301 --> 09:04.336
So I hope we got
some good desserts.

09:04.440 --> 09:06.511
First up, let's
start with Kanae.

09:06.615 --> 09:07.547
Let's go.

09:07.650 --> 09:09.134
NARRATOR: In today's
dessert challenge,

09:09.238 --> 09:12.103
Chef Ramsay and guest
judge Valerie Gordon

09:12.206 --> 09:15.693
will both score the dishesindividually from 1 to 5.

09:15.796 --> 09:18.523
The team with the most pointswill win the challenge.

09:18.627 --> 09:21.837
Here I have a deconstructedLuxardo tiramisu.

09:21.940 --> 09:24.633
I made my chocolate ladyfingers with a cherry glaze

09:24.736 --> 09:25.737
on the bottom.

09:25.841 --> 09:28.809
Yeah, presentation--
not the best for me.

09:28.913 --> 09:29.776
It feels unfinished.

09:29.879 --> 09:30.673
Yeah.

09:30.777 --> 09:31.778
But let's taste, yeah?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.231
Cherry is one of the
most challenging fruits

09:37.335 --> 09:38.750
to work with.

09:38.854 --> 09:41.304
You can either get that
gorgeous sweetness,

09:41.408 --> 09:45.343
or it can taste
like cough syrup.

09:45.446 --> 09:47.587
I'm getting a note
of cough syrup.

09:47.690 --> 09:49.450
GORDON RAMSAY: When you startdeconstructing something,

09:49.554 --> 09:51.867
you need to come back with itbetter than it was constructed.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.109
Right.

09:53.213 --> 09:54.352
GORDON RAMSAY: And so it'snot hitting those marks.

09:54.455 --> 09:55.249
Nowhere near it.

09:55.353 --> 09:57.217
So I'm giving it 1 lady finger.

09:57.320 --> 09:58.494
I'm going 2.

09:58.598 --> 10:03.361
Chef Valerie is not
holding back anything.

10:03.464 --> 10:04.569
GORDON RAMSAY: Right.

10:04.673 --> 10:06.709
Motto, describe yourdessert for Chef, please.

10:06.813 --> 10:07.814
OK.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.885
I'm a big fan of the
outdoors and camping.

10:09.988 --> 10:11.956
One of my favorite things to doout there is build a campfire

10:12.059 --> 10:14.165
and then do some S'Mores atthe end of the night, you know.

10:14.268 --> 10:16.408
So what I have here is a
campfire bread pudding.

10:16.512 --> 10:17.547
GORDON RAMSAY:
Very moist inside.

10:17.651 --> 10:18.756
It is very moist.

10:18.859 --> 10:20.654
[music playing]

10:20.758 --> 10:22.104
I think it's a great concept.

10:22.207 --> 10:23.243
It looks really good.

10:23.346 --> 10:24.693
And it's something that
definitely strikes a lot

10:24.796 --> 10:26.280
of emotional chords for people.

10:26.384 --> 10:28.455
The milk chocolate getsa little bit lost for me.

10:28.558 --> 10:31.113
I really would have taken
a bittersweet chocolate,

10:31.216 --> 10:34.426
so you get a little morecomplexity in the flavor.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.049
There's something
very lovely about it.

10:36.152 --> 10:37.153
I'm going to say 3.

10:37.257 --> 10:37.775
GORDON RAMSAY: Great
concept though.

10:37.878 --> 10:38.707
Thank you.

10:38.810 --> 10:39.569
You've energized
the challenge.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.536
It was great.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.951
Four me it's a 4.

10:42.055 --> 10:43.159
Thank you, chef.
[ding]

10:43.263 --> 10:44.713
A seven's a great
score to start off.

10:44.816 --> 10:46.404
You know, it got us
off the gate strong.

10:46.507 --> 10:47.888
So I have a deconstructed--

10:47.992 --> 10:49.476
Leave it alone.GORDON RAMSAY: I'm sorry.

10:49.579 --> 10:50.304
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

10:50.408 --> 10:51.616
Deconstructed here.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.824
What is going on?

10:52.928 --> 10:54.723
Chef, I tried to go
for the whole tart.

10:54.826 --> 10:55.620
But it crumbled.

10:55.724 --> 10:56.794
So I had to improvise.

10:56.897 --> 10:58.347
It's a roasted apple
and mascarpone tart.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.244
GORDON RAMSAY: OK.

10:59.348 --> 11:00.383
Let's see what we get here.

11:00.487 --> 11:01.281
GORDON RAMSAY: Dig in.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.804
The ginger is a little
aggressive for me.

11:06.907 --> 11:10.186
I want a stronger note ofcaramel to play with that.

11:10.290 --> 11:11.532
Or else it just gets muddy.

11:11.636 --> 11:14.121
And I would say that that'smy description of this dish,

11:14.225 --> 11:15.605
is muddy.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.228
So I go 2 on that.
GORDON RAMSAY: 2.

11:17.331 --> 11:18.919
I'm going to be generous
and give it a 2 as well.

11:19.023 --> 11:20.024
Thank you, Mia.
- Mmhm.

11:20.127 --> 11:21.266
VALERIE GORDON:
Stick with it, hon.

11:21.370 --> 11:22.440
[music playing]

11:22.543 --> 11:24.166
Sorry, Mia.

11:24.269 --> 11:25.823
Welcome to the real
world where you're

11:25.926 --> 11:28.101
not a perfect little princess.

11:28.204 --> 11:29.654
GORDON RAMSAY: Next up,
the Italian stallion.

11:29.758 --> 11:30.759
Brett.
- Brett.

11:30.862 --> 11:31.829
GORDON RAMSAY: Let's go, please.

11:31.932 --> 11:32.726
Get them, Brett.

11:32.830 --> 11:34.935
Come on, killer.

11:35.039 --> 11:37.041
I wanted to do a play onan Italian rice pudding,

11:37.144 --> 11:38.318
if you would.

11:38.421 --> 11:40.285
So I've prepared a whitechocolate and vanilla arancini.

11:40.389 --> 11:41.459
And these little
cuties are fried?

11:41.562 --> 11:42.356
They are.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.979
These are little fried balls?

11:44.082 --> 11:45.843
[music playing]

11:49.225 --> 11:50.123
Chef, how's that?

11:50.226 --> 11:51.055
Oof.

11:51.158 --> 11:52.056
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, no.

11:52.159 --> 11:54.506
[music playing]

11:59.235 --> 11:59.995
Chef, how's that?

12:00.098 --> 12:00.927
Oof.

12:01.030 --> 12:02.722
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, no.

12:02.825 --> 12:03.792
Al dente.

12:03.895 --> 12:04.689
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, jeez.

12:04.793 --> 12:05.690
Really?

12:05.794 --> 12:07.830
It is really al dente.

12:07.934 --> 12:10.902
NARRATOR: In today's dessertchallenge, season 14 veteran

12:11.006 --> 12:14.561
Brett's Italian arancini ballshave left guest judge Valerie

12:14.664 --> 12:16.770
Gordon extremely underwhelmed.

12:16.874 --> 12:17.667
Beyond undercooked.

12:17.771 --> 12:19.600
Just not really cooked.

12:19.704 --> 12:22.672
GORDON RAMSAY: Have a taste.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.915
Did you taste it?
As you were making it?

12:24.019 --> 12:25.503
I did, a thousand times, yeah.

12:25.606 --> 12:26.469
Yeah.

12:26.573 --> 12:27.436
Oh, dear.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.300
No, you don't want
to finish that.

12:29.403 --> 12:30.508
I like the concept.

12:30.611 --> 12:32.268
I think the concept
was interesting.

12:32.372 --> 12:35.444
But the idea might be great.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.033
The experience might not be.

12:38.136 --> 12:38.999
That's a 1.

12:39.103 --> 12:40.552
There's nothing
about that dish that

12:40.656 --> 12:42.485
came together successfully.

12:42.589 --> 12:43.521
It's a 1 for me as well.

12:43.624 --> 12:44.418
[ding]

12:44.522 --> 12:45.592
Damn.

12:45.695 --> 12:48.491
Chef Valerie justannihilated Brett's balls.

12:48.595 --> 12:49.389
So sorry.

12:49.492 --> 12:50.666
I fucked up, man.

12:50.770 --> 12:51.701
I'm so sorry, dog.

12:51.805 --> 12:52.599
It's all right.

12:52.702 --> 12:53.703
The Italian stallion over here.

12:53.807 --> 12:57.259
You just served raw
balls to two chefs.

12:57.362 --> 13:01.332
Somebody give Valerie a five.

13:01.435 --> 13:02.747
Ariel, let's go, please.

13:02.851 --> 13:04.853
I am like, completely
stressing out

13:04.956 --> 13:06.233
about getting my dish judged.

13:06.337 --> 13:09.547
I have a Thai lime
and beet tart.

13:09.650 --> 13:10.755
VALERIE GORDON:
There's a lot there.

13:10.859 --> 13:11.652
GORDON RAMSAY: Please.

13:11.756 --> 13:18.038
[music playing]

13:18.142 --> 13:19.350
That's yummy.

13:19.453 --> 13:21.731
That tastes really, really good.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.458
I don't think of beets anddessert, but that's delicious.

13:24.562 --> 13:27.254
There's something
very smart about this.

13:27.358 --> 13:28.186
This is a 4.

13:28.290 --> 13:29.153
Thank you, chef.

13:29.256 --> 13:30.913
I would love to
have seen 25% less.

13:31.017 --> 13:32.328
Because it gets a
little bit long-winded.

13:32.432 --> 13:33.778
VALERIE GORDON: Yeah.

13:33.882 --> 13:34.675
It's a 3 for me.

13:34.779 --> 13:35.573
Thank you.

13:35.676 --> 13:36.988
Thank you, chefs.

13:37.092 --> 13:38.265
All right.

13:38.369 --> 13:40.612
Now I can only pray thatTrevor got a banging-ass dish.

13:40.716 --> 13:41.510
Come on, Trevor.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.407
All right.

13:42.511 --> 13:43.650
We could do this.

13:43.753 --> 13:45.790
All I need to get is a 3or higher from both judges

13:45.894 --> 13:47.102
and we're in like Flynn.

13:47.205 --> 13:48.828
I've made this dessert
a bunch of times.

13:48.931 --> 13:50.001
Everybody loves it.
Yeah.

13:50.105 --> 13:51.140
I'm thinking, all
right, let's go

13:51.244 --> 13:52.901
up there and give her a kiss.

13:53.004 --> 13:54.247
These are avocado kisses.

13:54.350 --> 13:57.975
This is actually my
take on superfood.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.460
[music playing]

14:03.083 --> 14:04.809
I really dislike this dish.

14:04.913 --> 14:05.706
I have to say.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.401
I really dislike this.

14:10.504 --> 14:12.472
This is everything
that I dislike

14:12.575 --> 14:17.235
about healthful eating gettingintegrated with dessert.

14:17.339 --> 14:19.237
It's incredibly soggy.

14:19.341 --> 14:20.721
Like, am I dreaming this?

14:20.825 --> 14:22.862
Because this is like one ofmy nightmares, where I think

14:22.965 --> 14:25.002
that I make something
amazing, and then

14:25.105 --> 14:26.486
they just tear it to
shreds and tell me

14:26.589 --> 14:27.901
I'm fucking horrible at my job.

14:28.005 --> 14:30.076
It tastes like a bush.

14:30.179 --> 14:31.146
I want to forget this.

14:31.249 --> 14:32.319
GORDON RAMSAY: Dessert
should be a treat.

14:32.423 --> 14:33.251
Absolutely.

14:33.355 --> 14:34.287
Not a health kick.

14:34.390 --> 14:35.184
So I go 1.

14:35.288 --> 14:36.220
1, yeah.

14:36.323 --> 14:37.083
I agree.
Thank you.

Congratulations.

14:41.708 --> 14:44.745
We most definitely dodgeda bullet on this challenge.

14:44.849 --> 14:47.610
Thank God the guys were
worse than we were.

14:49.026 --> 14:50.061

Such a pleasure.

congratulations.

15:13.015 --> 15:14.879

Ladies, say goodbye
to the three wise men.

- Bye guys.
- Bye.

15:18.987 --> 15:20.954
This one almost doesn't
even feel like a win.

15:21.058 --> 15:24.164
Somehow my little
seven saved the day.

15:24.268 --> 15:25.648
Yo, she is intense.

15:25.752 --> 15:26.546
[inaudible]

15:26.649 --> 15:28.099
That was nerve-wracking.

15:28.203 --> 15:30.170
Men.

15:30.274 --> 15:32.793
Whilst the ladies areshopping at Sur La Table,

15:32.897 --> 15:35.210
you'll be here
chopping and chipping.

15:35.313 --> 15:39.283
Because it is ice deliveryday here in Hell's Kitchen.

15:39.386 --> 15:41.526
And you know, Motto, whenyou're making the most amazing

15:41.630 --> 15:43.839
cocktail and you've got
a handcrafted ice cube,

15:43.943 --> 15:45.599
how good does that
cocktail taste?

15:45.703 --> 15:46.807
That much better, chef.

15:46.911 --> 15:49.638
So we've got 600
pounds of ice coming.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.535
Got it?

15:50.639 --> 15:51.536
Yes, chef.

15:51.640 --> 15:52.710
Off you go.

15:52.813 --> 15:54.194
How many times have I
said that to you, Trev?

15:54.298 --> 15:55.437
Every time except once.

15:55.540 --> 15:56.334
GORDON RAMSAY: Oh, man.

15:56.438 --> 15:57.646
It's getting a little old.

15:57.749 --> 15:59.855
Man.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.030
I really thought
Trev and Brett,

16:02.133 --> 16:04.066
they were going toperform better than that.

16:04.170 --> 16:06.586
You know, I come out everyday with a positive attitude,

16:06.689 --> 16:09.209
a clear mind, ready to bust ass.

16:09.313 --> 16:10.659
I'm feeling pretty beat down.

16:10.762 --> 16:11.901
You guys again?

16:12.005 --> 16:13.800
Happy to see you too, man.

16:13.903 --> 16:14.697
OK.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.872
So did you ever do this before?

16:16.976 --> 16:19.081
The breaking of the ice blocks?

16:19.185 --> 16:20.186
Yeah.

16:20.289 --> 16:21.532
OK.

16:21.635 --> 16:24.535
So you grab the saw, go allthe way around the block,

16:24.638 --> 16:28.608
in order to get the perfectthree square, the ice cubes.

16:28.711 --> 16:30.748
We literally have hand saws.

16:30.851 --> 16:33.061
And we have to saw and
chisel through hundreds

16:33.164 --> 16:35.270
and hundreds of pounds
of ice to make fucking

16:35.373 --> 16:37.306
2 inch by 2 inch ice cubes.

16:37.410 --> 16:38.445
This sucks.

16:38.549 --> 16:40.240
Don't try to pick that
up by yourself, man.

16:40.344 --> 16:41.690
I've done it before, so.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.692
Trevor said he knew
what he was doing.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.728
So, knock yourself out, man.

16:45.832 --> 16:47.282
I guess me and Brett
are going to figure

16:47.385 --> 16:48.662
it out on the other one.

16:48.766 --> 16:51.113
[music playing]

16:53.460 --> 16:54.703

16:55.945 --> 16:57.326

16:59.052 --> 17:00.226
[music playing]

17:00.329 --> 17:01.503
Chef, you get out
of the kitchen too?

17:01.606 --> 17:02.400
JOCKY: Blue team.

17:02.504 --> 17:03.608
Jocky.

17:03.712 --> 17:04.609
Let's have some lunch.

17:04.713 --> 17:06.094
This is our first
time hanging out

17:06.197 --> 17:07.371
with Jocky outside the kitchen.

17:07.474 --> 17:09.166
So I'm looking
forward to getting

17:09.269 --> 17:10.684
to know him as a human being.

17:10.788 --> 17:14.343
Cause usually we're
terrified of him.

17:14.447 --> 17:16.897
What's for dessert?

17:17.001 --> 17:18.071
That's the question.

17:18.175 --> 17:21.040
I hope it's not theavocado and goji berries.

17:21.143 --> 17:22.524
I got so nervous.

17:22.627 --> 17:24.767
I have not been that
nervous in years.

17:24.871 --> 17:26.804
JOCKY: [inaudible]

17:26.907 --> 17:28.219
And I was just like--

17:28.323 --> 17:30.946
And I'm just sitting thereand I'm like, hmm, [inaudible]..

17:34.053 --> 17:37.090
I'm a little pissed off
still about the whole,

17:37.194 --> 17:39.058
oh, well, your
dish looks clunky.

17:39.161 --> 17:41.439
I think this will be sweet ontop of sweet on top of sweet.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.648
I feel like the brittle
is a little clunky.

17:43.752 --> 17:45.547
It sucks to be disregarded.

17:45.650 --> 17:47.307
I can't stand the
fakeness anymore.

17:47.411 --> 17:50.276
So I'm going to get throughdinner service as a team.

17:50.379 --> 17:53.486
And then it's every
man for themselves.

17:53.589 --> 17:54.383
Like homey.

17:55.971 --> 17:57.421
[inaudible]

18:06.533 --> 18:09.950
Oh, oh, oh.

18:10.054 --> 18:14.645
I present to you, the firstcube of the afternoon.

18:14.748 --> 18:16.025
One cube.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.751
That's about how many pointsyou got for that dessert.

18:17.855 --> 18:19.615
Ouch, Motto, ouch.

18:19.719 --> 18:20.547
Hey, man.

18:20.651 --> 18:21.514
I don't give a shit.

18:21.617 --> 18:23.688
One opinion, that's
all that was.

18:23.792 --> 18:26.657
Yo, the one opinion islike, one of the illest pastry

18:26.760 --> 18:27.692
chefs in the country, man.

18:27.796 --> 18:29.487
Her opinion is the world, dude.

18:29.591 --> 18:30.419
That's all right.

18:30.523 --> 18:31.386
I know it was good.

18:31.489 --> 18:33.042
I'm not going to
let it get me down.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.906
I lost mad respect
for Trevor today.

18:35.010 --> 18:36.598
Trevor's like, oh,
it's just her opinion.

18:36.701 --> 18:37.909
Valerie Gordon, man.

18:38.013 --> 18:41.534
Yo, she is a creme de lacreme pastry chef chocolatier.

18:41.637 --> 18:44.226
Her opinion means,
obviously, a whole lot.

18:46.918 --> 18:47.747
They don't like me.

18:47.850 --> 18:48.817
They just want me out of here.

18:48.920 --> 18:49.818
And I can give two shits.

18:49.921 --> 18:50.922
I'm looking at the black jacket.

18:51.026 --> 18:52.372
And one more person
has got to go home.

18:52.476 --> 18:54.374
Then I don't have to deal withanybody on a fucking team.

18:54.478 --> 18:55.513
And that's my goal right now.

18:55.617 --> 18:57.860
I just don't give
a fuck anymore.

19:17.949 --> 19:20.538

straight punishment.

19:20.642 --> 19:23.369
And Trevor is beginning tocrack under the pressure.

19:27.994 --> 19:31.239
I think Trev's cracking morethan the ice is at this point.

19:31.342 --> 19:33.172
We're having more
success tapping the saw.

19:36.865 --> 19:37.866
Whatever.

19:37.969 --> 19:38.970
We're not bonding at all.

19:39.074 --> 19:40.455
Those two want to
see me fucking gone.

19:40.558 --> 19:42.250
Why do you think two of themwent on one chunk of ice,

19:42.353 --> 19:44.562
and I was left out by
myself on the other?

19:44.666 --> 19:45.529
Oh, man.

19:45.632 --> 19:46.633
It's good to have
a sense of humor

19:46.737 --> 19:49.705
when the ice chips are down.

19:49.809 --> 19:52.708

Shopping spree.

Walking into Sur La Table islike a kid in a candy store.

direction to go.

23:36.587 --> 23:37.864
And I have a shellfish allergy.

23:37.968 --> 23:39.176
This is a seafood risotto.

23:39.279 --> 23:40.591
So I can't taste it.

23:40.695 --> 23:42.973
I'm bringing down the butter,but let me know the taste.

23:43.076 --> 23:44.043
Let's go.

23:44.146 --> 23:45.976
I understand having
a food allergy.

23:46.079 --> 23:48.668
However, you're a chef.

23:48.772 --> 23:50.739
You need to be able to cook theshit that you're allergic to.

23:50.843 --> 23:53.121
The tiniest bit moresalt. Not too much though.

23:53.224 --> 23:54.294
It doesn't make
sense for someone who

23:54.398 --> 23:56.262
can't taste it to even make it.

23:56.365 --> 23:58.782
You don't want two people goingback and forth from a pan.

23:58.885 --> 24:00.577
And I'm getting a
little bit frustrated.

24:00.680 --> 24:01.957
Ariel, why don't
you do the risotto?

24:02.061 --> 24:03.511
She does the carbonaro.
- I can do that, chef.

24:03.614 --> 24:04.615
GORDON RAMSAY: That's
the best way around, no?

24:04.719 --> 24:06.375
- Yep.
- I'm a perfectionist.

24:06.479 --> 24:09.586
I usually feel like I can doit better than somebody else.

24:09.689 --> 24:12.589
So it's hard for
me to ask for help.

24:12.692 --> 24:13.762
Two risotto, yes?

24:13.866 --> 24:14.694
OK.

24:14.798 --> 24:15.557
Let's go.

24:17.973 --> 24:18.836
Very nice, Ariel.

24:18.940 --> 24:19.734
Thank you, chef.

24:23.116 --> 24:24.980
NARRATOR: Thanks toAriel's veteran guidance,

24:25.084 --> 24:28.052
the blue team is nowsending out appetizers just

24:28.156 --> 24:29.433
as quickly as the red team.

24:29.537 --> 24:31.021
DINER: Oh, that looks great.
How is it?

24:31.124 --> 24:32.436

NARRATOR: And both kitchens areready to move on to entrees.

24:35.957 --> 24:36.716

Three halibut, one beef.

24:38.407 --> 24:39.236
ALL: Yes, chef.

24:39.339 --> 24:40.582
Let's go.

24:40.686 --> 24:42.826
I'm pulling welly in 3.

24:42.929 --> 24:43.999
I'm glad that I'm on meats.

24:44.103 --> 24:45.104
Brett's on fish.

24:45.207 --> 24:46.588
You know, we got
Motto on garnish.

24:46.692 --> 24:47.486
Halibut, how long?

24:47.589 --> 24:48.383
2 and 1/2.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.867
2 and 1/2, can I slice welly?

24:53.526 --> 24:54.976
This kitchen is flat right now.

24:55.079 --> 24:56.287
It's like being in a library.

24:56.391 --> 24:58.220
It's like, shh.

24:58.324 --> 24:59.774
Two minutes, New Yorks.

24:59.877 --> 25:01.810
I don't know what the hellis the deal with these two.

25:01.914 --> 25:02.915
I don't.

25:03.018 --> 25:04.330
God forbid you answer
fucking chef back.

25:04.433 --> 25:05.711
Come the fuck on.

25:05.814 --> 25:08.230
Can I slice welly?

25:08.334 --> 25:09.473
Yes?
- Yeah.

25:09.577 --> 25:10.716
No.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:10.819 --> 25:12.165

25:21.830 --> 25:22.797
Sauce for the halibut?

25:22.900 --> 25:25.006
BRET: In my hand, chef.

25:25.109 --> 25:26.041
Wellington, where is it?

25:26.145 --> 25:27.284

The wellington's raw.

25:42.644 --> 25:44.577
Come on, guys.

25:44.681 --> 25:45.682
Yeah, you just--

25:45.785 --> 25:47.131
Brett.

25:47.235 --> 25:48.719

25:48.823 --> 25:49.755
Fuck.
No.

25:49.858 --> 25:50.790
GORDON RAMSAY: Get
it back in the oven.

25:50.894 --> 25:51.791
- Yes, chef.- Where's the tester gone?

25:51.895 --> 25:52.861
Up front, chef.

25:52.965 --> 25:54.449
There's a reason
Trev's fucking cooking

25:54.553 --> 25:56.382
on that cruise ship by himself.

25:56.485 --> 25:58.039
Look at that.

25:58.142 --> 26:00.110
The test is better
than the real one.

26:00.213 --> 26:01.387
Get that in the
oven for one minute.

26:01.490 --> 26:03.009
I'll serve that.
- Yes, chef.

26:03.113 --> 26:04.079
GORDON RAMSAY: Shit.

26:04.183 --> 26:06.116
Red team, I'm missing
coordination here.

26:06.219 --> 26:07.807
I'm driving the tickets.
I'm picking up.

26:07.911 --> 26:08.739
Yes chef.

26:08.843 --> 26:09.947
GORDON RAMSAY:
I'm counting down.

26:10.051 --> 26:10.638
And nobody's getting theirhead out of the sand.

26:10.741 --> 26:11.431
- Yes, chef.
- Hey.

26:11.535 --> 26:12.329
Time to get a grip.

26:14.987 --> 26:16.057
[music playing]

26:16.160 --> 26:18.093
NARRATOR: It's 45 minutesinto dinner service.

26:18.197 --> 26:19.405
The Wellington's raw.

26:19.508 --> 26:20.889
NARRATOR: And
Trevor's undercooked

26:20.993 --> 26:24.168
Beef Wellington has brought thered kitchen to a standstill.

26:24.272 --> 26:25.411
- Get it back in the oven.- Yes, chef.

26:25.514 --> 26:26.377
Where's the tester gone?

26:26.481 --> 26:27.620
Up front, chef.

26:27.724 --> 26:28.517
You fucked up.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.002
It was fucking raw, man.

26:30.105 --> 26:31.141
GORDON RAMSAY: The
test is better.

26:31.244 --> 26:32.314
Get that in the
oven for one minute.

26:32.418 --> 26:33.212
I'll serve that.

26:33.315 --> 26:34.178
Yes, chef.

26:34.282 --> 26:36.284
Chef rides my ass constantly.

26:36.387 --> 26:38.907
Like, if I was chef, rightnow is the perfect time

26:39.011 --> 26:40.460
to push Trev to
his breaking point,

26:40.564 --> 26:43.429
to see how far he can be pushedbefore he either loses it,

26:43.532 --> 26:44.568
or he rises to the occasion.

26:44.672 --> 26:45.845
- Hey, come here, you.
- Yes, chef.

26:45.949 --> 26:47.295
Please start thinking
for me a little bit.

26:47.398 --> 26:48.572
Yes, chef.

26:48.676 --> 26:49.297
The one you test is betterthan the one you cooked.

26:49.400 --> 26:50.539
Than the one I had, yep.

26:50.643 --> 26:51.713
The one you gave me wasfucking red in the middle.

26:51.817 --> 26:52.818
OK.

26:52.921 --> 26:53.612
And the one that was
test is much better.

26:53.715 --> 26:54.129
But you need to step up now.

26:54.233 --> 26:55.027
Yes, chef.

26:55.130 --> 26:55.959
[music playing]

26:56.062 --> 26:57.616

26:59.514 --> 27:00.619
I'm in love.

27:00.722 --> 27:01.620
I need the momentum now.

27:01.723 --> 27:02.759
I've got momentum
on the appetizers.

27:02.862 --> 27:04.484
I need momentum on the entrees.- Heard, chef.

27:04.588 --> 27:06.210

Guys, how long?

27:08.454 --> 27:09.973
Keep talking to me.
How long?

27:10.076 --> 27:11.077
Give me four minutes.

27:11.181 --> 27:12.803
Four minutes, heard.

27:12.907 --> 27:13.735
I feel really good.

27:13.839 --> 27:14.633
I'm amped.

27:14.736 --> 27:16.117
I'm pumped.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.395
But these strip steaks
are thick as hell.

27:18.498 --> 27:20.811
So a little more difficult.

27:20.915 --> 27:23.469
Guys, I'm walking salmongarnish and New York garnish.

Yeah, really.

All of you, come here.

27:43.454 --> 27:44.524
Oh, my God.

27:44.628 --> 27:46.768
We cannot get kicked out
of the kitchen tonight.

27:46.872 --> 27:47.666
This cannot happen.

27:47.769 --> 27:48.563
And look.

27:48.667 --> 27:49.702
I've got white meat.

27:49.806 --> 27:50.738
White.

27:50.841 --> 27:52.291

27:55.950 --> 27:56.536
It was--
- It was bad?

27:56.640 --> 27:57.606
It was bad?

27:57.710 --> 27:58.987
You shouldn't chef.
I'm overcooking it.

27:59.091 --> 27:59.954
I apologize.

28:00.057 --> 28:00.575
But while we wait,
is it the fish?

28:00.679 --> 28:01.472
Is it the meat?

28:03.751 --> 28:04.717
What is it?

28:04.821 --> 28:05.614
Hell, no.

28:05.718 --> 28:06.823
It's not because of the fish.

28:06.926 --> 28:09.170
Heather just
overcooked the steak.

28:09.273 --> 28:10.619
Don't blame it on me.

28:10.723 --> 28:12.207
I basted too long, chef.I apologize.

Huh?

Fuck.

Two seconds.

28:44.792 --> 28:45.654
I haven't made this lamb.

28:45.758 --> 28:46.552
At all.

28:46.655 --> 28:47.622
Not one time.

28:47.726 --> 28:50.176
A million things are
going on right now.

How can you forgetthere's a crust on the lamb?

29:37.051 --> 29:38.949
I haven't done one yet.

29:39.053 --> 29:40.088
I haven't.

29:40.192 --> 29:42.194
I never cooked lamb,
so I forgot the crust.

Just say, I forgot the crust.

29:43.229 --> 29:44.058
My bad, chef.

It won't happen again.

29:45.300 --> 29:46.992
Not, oh, I never worked
the lamb station before.

29:47.095 --> 29:47.958
Oh.

29:48.062 --> 29:49.373
It's your job to
know what it is.

29:49.477 --> 29:50.789
It is, chef.
You're right about that.

29:50.892 --> 29:52.273
Right now, I've got
three individual cooks

29:52.376 --> 29:54.033
and there's no team spirit.

30:04.561 --> 30:05.700
I think it's under.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.288
How long for a refired strip?

30:07.391 --> 30:11.119
The refire, chef,
give me one minute.

30:11.223 --> 30:13.225
I'm very shocked that
Heather is struggling

30:13.328 --> 30:15.192
right now on this meat station.

30:15.296 --> 30:16.642
She was a runner-up.

30:16.745 --> 30:18.126
And she's a veteran.

30:18.230 --> 30:19.921
Are you ready with the refire?- Yes.

30:20.025 --> 30:20.819
I'm walking in 30 seconds.

30:20.922 --> 30:21.716
All right.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.890
I'm walking garnish again.

30:22.993 --> 30:24.650
In the real world,
you would not get

30:24.753 --> 30:27.895
away with just burning orovercooking food every night.

30:27.998 --> 30:29.482
You'd get fired for this.

30:29.586 --> 30:30.518
Behind you.

30:30.621 --> 30:36.420
[music playing]

30:36.524 --> 30:37.387
Better, chef?

30:37.490 --> 30:38.595
- It's fine.
- OK.

30:38.698 --> 30:39.734
GORDON RAMSAY: Let it rest.- Right.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.977
But I didn't have
time to rest those.

30:41.080 --> 30:42.323
I wanted to refire
and give them to you.

30:42.426 --> 30:43.427
Go.

30:43.531 --> 30:45.464
Just like when your
parents are disappointed

30:45.567 --> 30:48.156
and you apologize, but youstill feel a disappointment

30:48.260 --> 30:50.227
in their eyes--

30:50.331 --> 30:53.023
it's like the

I'm ready to go on lamb.

NARRATOR: While over
in the red kitchen,

31:00.997 --> 31:03.275
the men are desperately
hoping to do the same.

Let's do it.

31:20.602 --> 31:22.087

31:22.190 --> 31:23.364
You get in here.
Come here.

31:23.467 --> 31:26.091
They're going to
the back of the back.

31:26.194 --> 31:29.059
Somebody's going to
shed a tear back there.

31:29.163 --> 31:30.819
Close the fucking door.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.719
What in the fuck is going on?

31:33.822 --> 31:36.101
What's happening?

31:36.204 --> 31:37.033
We haven't found our stride.

31:37.136 --> 31:37.930
I know, chef.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.035
We're not pushing each other.

31:39.138 --> 31:40.450
We're sending crap.

31:40.553 --> 31:41.900
And then this here--

31:42.003 --> 31:44.074
that's the biggest

of careless mistakes

31:58.847 --> 32:01.367

There's no communication frommy other two fucking teammates

crumbling mentally.

going to say you,

36:00.641 --> 36:01.987
because the whole
reason that lamb was--

36:02.090 --> 36:03.057
it was dragging the fish.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.300
And everything else
just got backed up.

That had nothing to
do with the crust.

They were just fucking
loaded with meat.

It started with that
fucking halibut,

36:21.040 --> 36:22.249
and everything got backed up.

36:22.352 --> 36:25.355
Trev and Bret both held
back the team the most.

There was no communicationback and forth.

GORDON RAMSAY: Why, though?- I don't know.

37:18.408 --> 37:20.790
When I asked for an answer,I was fighting for a heard.

37:20.893 --> 37:23.793
I'm getting no feedback from myother two peeps in the kitchen.

37:26.658 --> 37:27.693
GORDON RAMSAY: Why?
- I don't know.

37:27.797 --> 37:28.901
- Absolutely not, chef.
- Not at all.

37:29.005 --> 37:29.799
Motto?

37:29.902 --> 37:30.765
No, I did not shut down.

37:30.869 --> 37:31.973
I kept moving.

37:32.077 --> 37:33.354
I kept going, kept tryingto pick my team up.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.080
TREVOR: You kept moving,but you didn't communicate.

37:35.183 --> 37:36.046
I got buried.
Yes.

37:36.150 --> 37:37.462
Did I fuck up a
couple of tickets?

37:37.565 --> 37:38.394
Yes.

37:38.497 --> 37:39.774
Were they being dragged by fish?

37:39.878 --> 37:40.706
Yes.

37:40.810 --> 37:42.846
The fish station fucked me.

37:42.950 --> 37:44.779
[music playing]

37:48.576 --> 37:49.612
I got buried.
Yes.

37:49.715 --> 37:51.061
Did I fuck up a
couple of tickets?

37:51.165 --> 37:51.959
Yes.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.340
Were they being dragged by fish?

37:53.443 --> 37:54.237
Yes.

37:54.341 --> 37:56.860
The fish station fucked me.

37:56.964 --> 37:58.655
[music playing]

37:58.759 --> 38:00.554
And the service continues.

38:00.657 --> 38:02.659
That, ladies, is what
I've just witnessed

38:02.763 --> 38:04.523
over the last two hours.

38:04.627 --> 38:06.698
Fragmented beyond belief.

38:06.801 --> 38:11.358
And no cohesiveness as a team.

38:11.461 --> 38:13.394
Did you think you had agood service tonight, Bret?

38:13.498 --> 38:14.809
No.
It was subpar, chef.

38:14.913 --> 38:17.156
Are you the weakest chefright now on the red team?

38:17.260 --> 38:18.434
No, chef.GORDON RAMSAY: You're not.

38:18.537 --> 38:19.883
Nope.
GORDON RAMSAY: Who is?

38:19.987 --> 38:21.299
I believe Trevor, chef.
Shaky, I--

38:21.402 --> 38:21.747
GORDON RAMSAY: You
believe Trevor.

38:21.851 --> 38:22.990
Why?

38:23.093 --> 38:24.267
BRET: I thought he brokedown a couple of days ago.

38:24.371 --> 38:26.718
At least I'm not
a one trick pony.

38:26.821 --> 38:27.891
GORDON RAMSAY: What
does that mean?

38:27.995 --> 38:29.341
TREVOR: All I see
out of Bret so far

38:29.445 --> 38:31.378
has been nothing but Italian.

38:31.481 --> 38:33.276
[music playing]

38:34.277 --> 38:36.003
GORDON RAMSAY: Trevor.

38:36.106 --> 38:37.729
Bret, step forward.

38:44.805 --> 38:46.185
Bret, why should you
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

38:46.289 --> 38:49.085
Chef, I give you everythingI have every day, chef.

38:49.188 --> 38:50.293
I cook my heart out.

38:50.397 --> 38:51.605
This is the lifestyle for me.

38:51.708 --> 38:52.537
It's food.

38:52.640 --> 38:53.745
It's all I have.

38:53.848 --> 38:55.194
And I feel like every day,I'm better here, chef.

38:55.298 --> 38:56.334
Every day you're
getting better,

38:56.437 --> 38:57.542
and that was your
worst performance.

38:57.645 --> 38:58.508
How does that match?

38:58.612 --> 38:59.578
I had a subpar
performance tonight.

38:59.682 --> 39:00.441
Everything else I've been--

39:00.545 --> 39:01.408
I had undercooked fish, chef.

39:01.511 --> 39:02.961
Why was that?

39:03.064 --> 39:05.515
No excuses.

39:05.619 --> 39:06.551
Trev.

39:06.654 --> 39:07.621
Yes, chef.

39:07.724 --> 39:08.863
What's happened to you?

39:08.967 --> 39:09.933
Nothing's happened to me.

39:10.037 --> 39:10.934
GORDON RAMSAY: Nothing's
happened to you.

39:11.038 --> 39:12.142
Nothing.
I got backed--

39:12.246 --> 39:13.385
- The team have given up on you.- Yes, they have.

39:13.489 --> 39:14.490
GORDON RAMSAY: Why?- But we've seen this before.

39:14.593 --> 39:15.594
I have no idea.

39:15.698 --> 39:17.078
Because nobody likes
the guy that stands up.

39:17.182 --> 39:17.976
I don't give up.

39:18.079 --> 39:19.253
You know this.

39:19.357 --> 39:22.567
You see my fight everyfucking day that I'm here.

39:22.670 --> 39:24.845
Always, from the
beginning to the end.

39:24.948 --> 39:26.018
This isn't a lifestyle for me.

39:26.122 --> 39:27.399
This is my life.

39:27.503 --> 39:28.987
I would do anything
for this job.

39:33.025 --> 39:36.408
[music playing]

39:36.512 --> 39:40.274
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen is--

39:40.378 --> 39:42.656
[music playing]

39:49.145 --> 39:49.939
Trev.

39:52.976 --> 39:53.874
Listen carefully.

39:53.977 --> 39:54.875
TREVOR: Yes, chef.

39:54.978 --> 39:56.808
This is your
third time up here.

39:56.911 --> 39:58.085
Yes, it is.

39:58.188 --> 40:02.227
And the downward spiralover the last three services

40:02.330 --> 40:05.092
indicates to me that
you are not ready to be

40:05.195 --> 40:08.578
my head chef in Las Vegas.

40:08.682 --> 40:09.510
Give me your jacket.

40:09.614 --> 40:12.030
Yes, chef.

40:12.133 --> 40:13.376
GORDON RAMSAY: Thank you.- Thank you.

40:13.480 --> 40:14.860
- I wish you the best of luck.- Always.

40:14.964 --> 40:16.206
Thank you.

40:16.310 --> 40:18.657
[music playing]

40:23.248 --> 40:24.422
I don't understand.

40:24.525 --> 40:26.320
I think Bret should
be going home, not me.

40:26.424 --> 40:28.391
The guy definitely doesn'thave as much passion as I do.

40:28.495 --> 40:30.151
And neither does Motto.

40:30.255 --> 40:31.532
Those guys didn't
give up anything.

40:31.636 --> 40:32.947
They have a lifestyle.

40:33.051 --> 40:34.155
And I don't have a lifestyle.

40:34.259 --> 40:36.503
I just gave up my life
to come back here again.

40:36.606 --> 40:38.332
You know, I really know
that I can do this.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.231
And I don't want to doanything else with my life, so.

40:41.335 --> 40:42.681
I'm just going to keep pushing.

40:42.785 --> 40:43.613
Bret.

40:43.717 --> 40:45.753
Yes, chef.

40:45.857 --> 40:47.652
I've given you a lifeline.

40:47.755 --> 40:50.102
But I want to see a
lot more from you.

40:50.206 --> 40:51.310
Back in line.
- Yes, chef.

40:51.414 --> 40:52.208
Thank you, chef.

40:52.311 --> 40:53.589
[music playing]

40:53.692 --> 40:56.177
Only two members
left in the red team.

40:56.281 --> 41:00.596
Ladies, which one of you
will emerge as a leader

41:00.699 --> 41:04.289
and jump in to the red team?

41:04.392 --> 41:08.707
Because right now,
they need one.

41:08.811 --> 41:10.122
Desperately.
Understood?

41:10.226 --> 41:11.020
ALL: Yes, chef.

41:11.123 --> 41:12.124
Now piss off.

41:12.228 --> 41:13.367
Yes, chef.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.681
[music playing]

41:16.784 --> 41:18.406
I want to emerge as a leader.

41:18.510 --> 41:20.754
And I feel like I can takecharge in the red team.

41:20.857 --> 41:22.928
And I just need to
prove it to Chef Ramsay.

41:23.032 --> 41:23.860
And this is my chance.

41:23.964 --> 41:25.310
Come on.

41:25.413 --> 41:27.588
There's a reason why he got putup three times in a row, man.

41:27.692 --> 41:28.796
Bye, Trev.

41:28.900 --> 41:30.004
Bon voyage.

41:30.108 --> 41:32.524
Good luck, wherever
the fuck you end up.

41:32.628 --> 41:34.250
Don't make it Baton Rouge.

41:34.353 --> 41:36.321
I got your one
trick pony, homie.

41:36.424 --> 41:37.874
No more Mr. Nice Guy.

41:37.978 --> 41:39.842
My girl told me when
I come out here,

41:39.945 --> 41:41.844
you know, try and be morekind than you were originally.

41:41.947 --> 41:42.741
Man, fuck that.

Kind ain't going
to cut it, baby.

passionate chefs I've

41:46.952 --> 41:48.575
ever had in Hell's Kitchen.

41:48.678 --> 41:50.991
But until he has the
support of his brigade,

41:51.094 --> 41:53.441
he'll continue to
be lost at sea.
