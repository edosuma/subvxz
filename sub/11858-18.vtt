WEBVTT

00:30.709 --> 00:31.959
Max! Max!

00:32.041 --> 00:33.834
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am,
stay back.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.083
Go on the other side
of the street.

00:35.166 --> 00:36.917
My baby's in there.
My son.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.291
- Where is he?
- My son. Oh, my God!

00:38.375 --> 00:40.333
- He's just a little baby.
- What floor?

00:40.417 --> 00:42.291
Hey, we got a kid in
there.
Radio McElroy.

00:42.375 --> 00:44.542
- Ma'am, what floor?
- The fourth floor.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.458
- 4F, 4-4F, 4F.
- McElroy!

00:46.542 --> 00:48.041
McElroy, fourth floor..

01:01.458 --> 01:03.417
[crying]
No, no.

01:10.875 --> 01:12.959
[crying]
Oh, my baby!

01:13.041 --> 01:14.458
'No!'

01:19.000 --> 01:21.709
[crying]
'Oh, my God, my baby.'

01:21.792 --> 01:23.542
'My baby, Max.'

01:41.417 --> 01:44.083
(Miller)
Central detectives picked
this lady up a few hours ago.

01:44.166 --> 01:46.041
Said she went nuts
in Rittenhouse Square.

01:46.125 --> 01:48.500
Scared the pants off
some dudes feeding the birds.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.667
Ex-junkie.
She still using?

01:50.750 --> 01:52.500
I don't know.
Sure acts in that way.

01:52.583 --> 01:55.000
Screaming she knows something
about a job from '05.

01:55.083 --> 01:57.333
Oh, boy, this should
be
a waste of time.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.500
Lot of people you give
the benefit of the doubt

01:59.583 --> 02:01.583
but not addicts, huh?

02:01.667 --> 02:03.250
I was raised by one.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.500
Got no illusions left.

02:05.583 --> 02:07.000
(Miller)
'Heads up.
Trouble's coming.'

02:07.083 --> 02:09.000
(Saccardo)
'Hey, ladies.'

02:09.083 --> 02:10.417
Tombs are the place
to be today, huh?

02:10.500 --> 02:12.792
I got a stimulating
conversation
to look forward to.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.625
- Few cells down.
- Priscilla Chapin.

02:14.709 --> 02:16.166
Oh, smackhead zombie.
I know her.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.709
You know all the
screw-ups,
Saccardo.

02:17.792 --> 02:19.333
Hey, they make me feel
good about myself.

02:19.417 --> 02:21.875
I got her hauled in for a
disorderly conduct this
morning.

02:21.959 --> 02:24.208
- Says she's got a tip.
- Yeah, waste your time.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.709
Well, that's what I said.

02:28.625 --> 02:30.000
(Priscilla)
'You're making a mistake.'

02:30.083 --> 02:32.041
'I need to get out of here.'

02:32.125 --> 02:33.208
'This is..'

02:39.625 --> 02:40.667
(Miller)
'Morning, Priscilla.'

02:40.750 --> 02:41.917
Detectives Miller and Rush.

02:42.000 --> 02:43.875
I gotta get outta here.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.709
You gotta help me.
You gotta get me out of here.

02:45.792 --> 02:47.375
Yeah? 'Cause, uh,
we heard you had
information

02:47.458 --> 02:49.041
on a homicide but
if you got an
appointment--

02:49.125 --> 02:50.291
It's about my son.

02:50.375 --> 02:51.875
Oh, says here
that the apartment

02:51.959 --> 02:54.375
you were living in 2005
burned to the ground

02:54.458 --> 02:55.959
'with your eight-month-old
son in it.'

02:56.041 --> 02:58.458
Ruled accidental
death.
Not a murder.

02:58.542 --> 03:01.166
I saw him this morning
in the park.

03:03.333 --> 03:04.333
You saw your son?

03:04.417 --> 03:05.750
Yeah.

03:05.834 --> 03:07.750
Max was on the playground.

03:07.834 --> 03:09.166
I know it was him.

03:09.250 --> 03:10.500
I-I ran over to him

03:10.583 --> 03:12.375
but then, he was gone
in the crowd.

03:12.458 --> 03:13.750
You using again, Priscilla?

03:13.834 --> 03:14.792
No.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.417
No. I-I'm clean.

03:19.834 --> 03:22.500
When I got pregnant,
I did 90 meetings in 90 days.

03:22.583 --> 03:24.500
'I haven't used since.'

03:24.583 --> 03:26.083
So, how does it make sense

03:26.166 --> 03:27.500
'your son being
in the park today?'

03:27.583 --> 03:29.875
It's not what
they thought it
was.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.792
- That fire..
- Well, they blamed it on
you.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.291
Left the gas stove
on
in your apartment.

03:33.375 --> 03:35.625
It was cold.
The heat didn't work.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.542
Sometimes I put the stove on.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.375
You left your baby
alone
that night to..

03:40.542 --> 03:42.834
"...grab some
cigarettes
at the bodega."

03:42.917 --> 03:45.125
Came back.
Fire had taken everything.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.625
Just some cigarettes, huh?

03:46.709 --> 03:47.875
They should have
prosecuted you

03:47.959 --> 03:49.542
for negligent
homicide,
Priscilla.

03:49.625 --> 03:51.250
I didn't turn the gas on.

03:51.333 --> 03:52.458
Not that night.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.709
- So who did?
- I don't know.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.125
Somebody else.

03:57.208 --> 03:59.500
When you figure it
out,
holler at us.

03:59.583 --> 04:00.625
I'm out.

04:01.959 --> 04:04.625
(Priscilla)
'Please, you gotta believe
me.'

04:04.709 --> 04:06.250
I saw my son.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.000
His name is Max.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.375
He has sandy hair

04:09.458 --> 04:11.709
and he has a birthmark
on his right arm.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.291
It was him in the park.

04:15.959 --> 04:17.083
We'll take a look.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.500
Any truth
to what you're saying..

04:20.792 --> 04:21.917
...we'll find it.

04:59.083 --> 05:00.875
(Stillman)
'What do you got
from Rittenhouse Square'

05:00.959 --> 05:02.417
that points to
Priscilla Chapin's
son?

05:02.500 --> 05:05.000
(Rush)
I tracked down only two kids
there this morning.

05:05.083 --> 05:06.834
Eight and ten.
Too old.

05:06.917 --> 05:08.250
Coroner's report
tells it all though.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.333
"Blast threw Max Chapin
out of his crib.

05:10.417 --> 05:11.625
"Fractured his bones.

05:11.709 --> 05:12.875
Blaze got everything
but the skeleton."

05:12.959 --> 05:14.041
(Stillman)
Gas fire?

05:14.125 --> 05:15.792
(Rush)
On February 12, 2005.

05:15.875 --> 05:17.875
Time PFD got it under control

05:17.959 --> 05:20.375
252 Baker Street
burned to the ground.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.750
All the tenants got out
except the baby.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.458
(Rush)
Well, mom told the police she
left him alone for ten
minutes.

05:25.542 --> 05:27.333
Her neighbor had
the baby monitor.

05:27.417 --> 05:28.709
(Vera)
That's her babysitting
solution?

05:28.792 --> 05:31.166
This Priscilla
has possession charges.

05:31.250 --> 05:34.667
'01, '02 and '04.
A teenage runaway.

05:34.750 --> 05:37.333
- Avoided juvie by doing rehab.
- Baby's father in the picture?

05:37.417 --> 05:40.125
Mom said he was AWOL,
never even met the kid.

05:40.208 --> 05:42.083
'No one listed
on the birth certificate.'

05:42.166 --> 05:45.041
Louie! You didn't have to
dress up for us.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.250
Well, if not for you,
then who, Rush?

05:47.333 --> 05:49.083
Me, clearly.

05:49.166 --> 05:50.667
What's your take on
the Baker Street fire, Louie?

05:50.750 --> 05:53.208
Well, right here's the
source
of the, uh, gas leak.

05:53.291 --> 05:54.667
(Stillman)
'The kitchen.'

05:54.750 --> 05:56.959
All neighbors said
Priscilla Chapin had a habit

05:57.041 --> 05:58.333
of leaving the gas stove on.

05:58.417 --> 05:59.917
H-hinky thing?

06:00.000 --> 06:02.875
I'm seeing alligator patterns
in that room right over here.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.166
- The baby's room?
- Yup.

06:04.250 --> 06:05.417
What do you mean alligator?

06:05.500 --> 06:07.750
Well, on the walls,
if fire burns really hot

06:07.834 --> 06:10.041
or burns it for a long time,
it does it, but..

06:10.125 --> 06:11.583
But if the fire started
in the kitchen

06:11.667 --> 06:12.750
that's where
you should see them.

06:12.834 --> 06:13.875
Right.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.792
So the fire marshal
had it wrong in '05.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.041
Wasn't an accident?

06:19.125 --> 06:20.959
Look, the gas
came from the stove.

06:21.041 --> 06:22.792
That caused the blast,
you know?

06:22.875 --> 06:24.125
'But there was a fire burning'

06:24.208 --> 06:25.917
in that kid's room
before the explosion.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.417
So how's that
happen,
an eight-month-old

06:27.500 --> 06:28.834
doesn't play with matches.

06:28.917 --> 06:30.834
Have a talk with the
firefighter
who found the baby.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.417
See what he remembers
from that bedroom.

06:34.333 --> 06:36.458
(McElroy)
'You're saying the fire
started
in the baby's room?'

06:38.709 --> 06:39.834
(Jeffries)
'That's one theory.'

06:42.917 --> 06:46.041
Hey, you remember a-a candle,
an incense?

06:46.125 --> 06:48.083
Anything might have sparked
the fire in that room?

06:48.166 --> 06:50.166
If anything incendiary
wasn't eaten up by then

06:50.250 --> 06:52.458
I-I would've reported
it,
but, uh..

06:52.542 --> 06:53.750
Right.

06:55.917 --> 06:58.166
I'm sorry, guys.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.375
(Jeffries)
'It's a tough memory to shake'

06:59.458 --> 07:00.917
seeing a kid die like that.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.458
Hell, my daughter
had just been born, so, uh..

07:03.542 --> 07:06.125
Alright. Know you did
the best you could.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.792
Heading in there, I, I..

07:09.166 --> 07:10.458
...I didn't know
what I'd find.

07:39.792 --> 07:41.041
Yeah, I've seen places.

07:41.125 --> 07:43.125
Junkies let their kids
sleep on the floor.

07:43.208 --> 07:44.458
There's trash everywhere.

07:46.041 --> 07:47.291
'Not this kid.'

07:47.375 --> 07:48.583
'This one was loved.'

07:48.667 --> 07:50.542
I believe there was glass
on the floor?

07:50.625 --> 07:51.792
Uh, from the window.

07:51.875 --> 07:52.875
'It was broken.'

07:53.917 --> 07:55.500
If it got broke in the blast

07:55.583 --> 07:57.333
it should have blown out..

07:57.417 --> 07:58.583
...right on to the fire escape.

07:58.667 --> 08:00.709
Well, it was inside
the apartment for sure.

08:00.792 --> 08:02.875
I mean, I almost cut myself
getting that kid out.

08:02.959 --> 08:05.500
The window wasn't broken
in the blast.

08:05.583 --> 08:09.375
Someone busted into that room,
started that fire.

08:09.458 --> 08:10.834
And this just became a homicide.

08:12.792 --> 08:15.792
Owner of 252 Baker got $925,000

08:15.875 --> 08:18.166
in insurance money
when the place burned down.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.500
That neighborhood?

08:19.583 --> 08:20.792
Couldn't have
gotten
that on the market

08:20.875 --> 08:22.458
if he wallpapered in gold.

08:22.542 --> 08:23.709
Victor Martinez.

08:23.792 --> 08:25.458
He's got two condos
in Mt. Airy

08:25.542 --> 08:26.917
and a high-rise downtown.

08:27.000 --> 08:30.709
So, 252 Baker's the
eyesore.
Makes motive.

08:30.792 --> 08:33.792
Licenses and Inspections sent
these over a couple minutes
ago.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.166
Code violations filed
against the landlord

08:36.250 --> 08:37.458
by the tenant in 4F.

08:37.542 --> 08:38.834
- That Priscilla?
- Yep.

08:38.917 --> 08:40.792
Said the heat wasn't working
in the dead of winter.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.583
Unsanitary conditions.

08:42.667 --> 08:44.875
- That can bring a hefty
fine.
- Or worse.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.500
Guy gets sued by the city.
Loses those condos.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.250
That fire could have
killed
two birds

08:50.333 --> 08:52.500
with one stone for
you,
Victor.

08:52.583 --> 08:54.417
Get some cash
from that rat trap.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.792
(Rush)
'And finished off
your pain-in-the-ass tenant.'

08:56.875 --> 08:59.333
- 'Priscilla Chapin.'
- Excuse me?

08:59.417 --> 09:02.250
What about me being a member
of the Chamber of Commerce

09:02.333 --> 09:03.583
'and a Catholic make you think'

09:03.667 --> 09:05.625
that I would take
the life of a child?

09:05.709 --> 09:07.500
That part was, uh..

09:09.291 --> 09:10.625
...unfortunate.

09:10.709 --> 09:12.208
(Rush)
'But you're a businessman,
Victor.'

09:12.291 --> 09:14.625
And that neighborhood,
wasn't getting any better.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.792
For your information,
I had an interested buyer

09:16.875 --> 09:19.458
and I would have made
more than the
insurance.

09:19.542 --> 09:20.500
That's real concrete.

09:20.583 --> 09:22.125
You want the truth?

09:22.208 --> 09:25.041
Yeah, Priscilla Chapin's
the reason

09:25.125 --> 09:26.333
my property got burnt
to a crisp.

09:26.417 --> 09:27.625
By leaving the stove on?

09:27.709 --> 09:29.834
I'm talking
about
her lifestyle,
man.

09:29.917 --> 09:32.375
She tried to go
clean
for the baby.

09:32.458 --> 09:36.291
[scoffs]
Once that bed is made,
you know.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.667
And tough to leave
the addict life
behind.

09:38.750 --> 09:41.625
- So she started using again?
- She was white-knuckling it.

09:41.709 --> 09:43.125
Trying to turn her life around.

09:44.875 --> 09:46.750
But some people didn't wanna
get left behind.

09:51.208 --> 09:54.208
(Priscilla)
Come on, Max.
Please stop crying.

09:54.291 --> 09:56.041
It's time to go
to sleep now, baby.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.250
There, that's better?

10:00.333 --> 10:01.959
'You love the dryer,
don't you?'

10:03.250 --> 10:05.834
Please, please, please,
I'm so tired.

10:05.917 --> 10:08.500
Honey, shh.

10:09.750 --> 10:12.417
People said you were dead,
Priscilla.

10:16.083 --> 10:18.792
But I knew you was laying low.

10:21.917 --> 10:23.333
Oh, look, man.

10:24.875 --> 10:28.917
[sighs]
I, uh, I had a baby,
Franklin.

10:29.000 --> 10:30.709
So?

10:30.792 --> 10:32.417
You know,
I-I'm gonna get a job.

10:32.500 --> 10:34.709
A part-time job,
and I will pay you
back.

10:34.792 --> 10:36.625
Yeah, don't pay me back
like that, girl.

10:40.000 --> 10:41.542
I'm-I'm clean.

10:43.166 --> 10:44.375
I'm a mom now.

10:45.709 --> 10:48.709
Then I need cash.
Three days.

10:48.792 --> 10:52.166
And if you fail to uphold
our business agreement, then..

10:52.250 --> 10:53.667
...I might have to get creative.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.417
- He's cute.
- 'It's okay.'

11:00.500 --> 11:02.000
'It's okay, Max.'

11:02.083 --> 11:03.750
[whispering]
It's going to be okay.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.083
It's nice of you
to intervene there, Vic.

11:10.166 --> 11:11.542
Are you nuts?

11:11.625 --> 11:12.959
You know who that guy is?

11:13.041 --> 11:14.250
Franklin Palmer.

11:14.333 --> 11:16.208
A big-time crack
and heroin
dealer.

11:16.291 --> 11:18.083
He's a real humanitarian.

11:18.166 --> 11:19.583
You didn't hear this
all from me, alright?

11:20.709 --> 11:22.375
Oh, relax.
He's in prison now.

11:22.458 --> 11:25.375
Yeah, for torching the house
of one of his enemies.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.250
(Jeffries)
You threatened Priscilla
Chapin

11:35.333 --> 11:37.083
to give you your money
back or else..

11:37.166 --> 11:38.542
A week later,
her apartment building

11:38.625 --> 11:39.875
goes up in flames.

11:39.959 --> 11:41.667
You realize her kid died
in that fire?

11:42.959 --> 11:43.959
I do.

11:45.792 --> 11:48.583
Sometimes God plucks
the most beautiful
flowers.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.000
You wouldn't
be gettin' sarcastic

11:50.083 --> 11:51.250
about a kid dyin',
would you?

11:51.333 --> 11:52.750
No, man.

11:52.834 --> 11:54.333
Look..

11:54.417 --> 11:57.208
...I don't take severe measures
with that kinda repeat customer.

11:57.291 --> 12:00.083
Priscilla was clean.
She wasn't coming back to you.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.291
So maybe you took away
the thing she loved.

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
Smack is what she loved, dawg.

12:04.667 --> 12:08.083
H is a pleasure like you
can't find in this world.

12:08.166 --> 12:10.458
Give that up
for a crying
baby

12:10.542 --> 12:12.083
and a fast food job?

12:12.166 --> 12:13.875
[scoffs]
No
contest.

12:13.959 --> 12:15.250
Saying Priscilla fell
off the wagon?

12:15.333 --> 12:16.792
I'm sayin' the whole
point
of usin'

12:16.875 --> 12:18.250
is to escape reality.

12:20.208 --> 12:23.208
And that girl's reality
was...bleak.

12:45.417 --> 12:46.709
Come on, girl.

12:49.875 --> 12:52.083
(female #1)
'Hey, have you seen Ellis?'

12:52.166 --> 12:54.667
What are you doing here,
Chantelle? I'm working.

12:54.750 --> 12:56.166
He ain't been
around.
I don't know.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.667
I think maybe he left me.

12:57.750 --> 12:59.166
He's no good, Chantelle.

12:59.250 --> 13:01.625
He can't stay with anyone
longer than two weeks anyway.

13:02.667 --> 13:03.917
Look, I gotta get back
to work.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.458
I'm thinkin' maybe
it's 'cause of you.

13:05.542 --> 13:07.291
'Cause I know you been
calling about that
baby.

13:08.291 --> 13:09.417
You better stay away from him.

13:10.834 --> 13:12.500
He needs to own up
to his responsibilities.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.875
He don't want
you,
or your kid.

13:15.959 --> 13:18.333
Probably he ain't even the
father. He don't owe you
squat.

13:18.417 --> 13:21.625
He is the father,
and he will help us.

13:21.709 --> 13:23.208
You know what?
You see him around?

13:23.291 --> 13:25.083
You tell him I'm going to
the cops if he doesn't own up.

13:25.166 --> 13:27.500
Stay away from
him!
I'll kill you,
bitch!

13:27.583 --> 13:29.417
Hey! Get out! Get out!

13:29.500 --> 13:31.750
- I'll break..
- 'Out of this store.'

13:37.917 --> 13:40.000
Priscilla, that's it.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.083
- No.
- You, too.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.875
Please. Please.

13:42.959 --> 13:44.709
Matt, I-I need this job.

13:48.625 --> 13:52.208
It was only a matter of time
before she came callin'.

13:52.291 --> 13:54.000
Except I got locked up
a few days later.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.917
- Who was the crackhead?
- Man, I don't know, man.

13:57.000 --> 13:58.417
You know all them fiends
be the same.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.875
- Got me.
- And the baby's daddy? Ellis?

14:00.959 --> 14:02.792
Do I look like 411, dawg?

14:04.291 --> 14:05.375
I don't know.

14:05.458 --> 14:07.208
Skinny white boy.

14:07.291 --> 14:08.917
Be surprised
if he's still
kickin' it.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.792
Short shelf life,
these types.

14:10.875 --> 14:13.417
Especially with Franklin
here
pushing 'em off.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.750
Why haven't you found Max?
I don't understand.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.375
We need to talk
about Max's father, Ellis.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.375
Ellis? Why?

14:24.458 --> 14:26.000
'Cause back in the day,
you told his girl

14:26.083 --> 14:27.458
you were gonna rat him out.

14:27.542 --> 14:28.583
Get his ass tossed in jail

14:28.667 --> 14:29.750
if he didn't pay up.

14:29.834 --> 14:31.750
Ellis was broke, okay?

14:31.834 --> 14:33.792
We were in love with
dope,
not each other.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.333
He never even met Max.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.542
You need to find my
son.
He's out there.

14:39.792 --> 14:41.583
There was no four-year-old boy
at that park.

14:41.667 --> 14:42.792
Yes, there was.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.625
Is there a reason
you're protecting Ellis?

14:44.709 --> 14:46.500
'Maybe he came back,
hurt your kid?'

14:51.667 --> 14:53.542
That first night
in the hospital..

14:54.542 --> 14:55.834
...when Max was born..

14:57.291 --> 14:59.291
...they, uh, they put him in

14:59.375 --> 15:02.291
this little plastic thing
next to me.

15:02.375 --> 15:04.792
'And he started to cry
in the middle of the night.'

15:05.834 --> 15:07.375
'He was all swaddled up.'

15:08.542 --> 15:09.959
And I took it all off of him.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.625
All those layers.

15:12.709 --> 15:15.166
And I put him right here
on my heart.

15:16.291 --> 15:17.792
S-skin to skin.

15:20.375 --> 15:22.291
And I felt him start to..

15:22.375 --> 15:23.542
...breathe like me.

15:25.041 --> 15:26.166
It's the first time I ever felt

15:26.250 --> 15:27.583
like I had something to give.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.500
I would never allow anyone
to hurt him.

15:35.375 --> 15:36.375
'Ever.'

15:44.750 --> 15:45.750
You called?

15:46.709 --> 15:48.375
Uh, Ellis Smith.

15:48.458 --> 15:49.709
Know him?

15:49.792 --> 15:51.375
Of him, yeah.

15:51.458 --> 15:52.709
Guy'd sell his
mama
for a fix.

15:52.792 --> 15:54.166
Oh, where can I find him?

15:54.250 --> 15:57.375
I think he's a user nomad.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.709
I hear his sister pays
for him to go

15:58.792 --> 16:00.208
into the Maloney Smith Center

16:00.291 --> 16:01.709
every once in a while,
make a half-assed attempt

16:01.792 --> 16:03.000
to get clean.

16:03.083 --> 16:04.750
Real winners you hang with,
Saccardo.

16:04.834 --> 16:08.041
Hey, you know, you find
Ellis,
keep him for me.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.667
I got a Mexican
trafficking thing I wanna

16:09.750 --> 16:11.709
conversate with him
about, alright?

16:11.792 --> 16:12.792
Alright.

16:19.875 --> 16:21.333
- What?
- Why you work in this job?

16:21.417 --> 16:22.709
That how I make the big bucks.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.583
You got a thing for kid jobs?

16:24.667 --> 16:27.542
Or addicts?
Or is it the combo
platter?

16:27.625 --> 16:28.750
Kids with addict moms?

16:29.750 --> 16:32.000
Just doing my job, Saccardo.

16:32.083 --> 16:33.125
That's it.

16:41.041 --> 16:44.083
I saw Ellis here at the
clinic
around Thanksgiving maybe.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.500
Not since then, no.

16:45.583 --> 16:47.291
Well, he ever mention anything
about his son?

16:48.333 --> 16:49.667
The one who died?

16:49.750 --> 16:50.917
Ellis is an addict.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.750
He doesn't have a lot
of lucid moments

16:52.834 --> 16:55.458
especially of,
let's say, accountability.

16:55.542 --> 16:56.750
What about the baby's mother?

16:56.834 --> 16:58.667
Oh, she came by here once..

16:58.750 --> 16:59.750
...to visit him with the baby.

16:59.834 --> 17:01.208
- Priscilla was here?
- Mmm.

17:01.291 --> 17:03.458
On hands and knees.
Like Ellis was any kind of
help.

17:03.542 --> 17:05.417
She make any threats
about going to the cops?

17:05.500 --> 17:06.917
Not that I know of.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.250
You know Ellis pretty
well,
I mean..

17:09.333 --> 17:10.959
...rehab gets intimate.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.208
Mmm, yes, it can,
when they're honest.

17:13.291 --> 17:15.542
Did he seem like the
type
who'd hurt his kid?

17:15.625 --> 17:16.792
Hurt him?

17:16.875 --> 17:18.417
You mean set that fire?

17:18.500 --> 17:21.250
I know that for addicts,
serving their addiction

17:21.333 --> 17:23.709
is more important than anything.

17:23.792 --> 17:24.959
More than their own life..

17:25.959 --> 17:27.291
...or the life of their child.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.917
Max is really sick, Ellis.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.583
I swiped him baby aspirin,
'cause I lost my job.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.333
But it's not working.
I need to take him to a
doctor.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.375
Why do you wanna lay
it
all on me, Priscilla?

17:49.458 --> 17:50.709
'Look at where I'm at.'

17:50.792 --> 17:52.208
You think this is easy for me?

17:53.875 --> 17:55.709
I'm trying everything I can
to stay clean.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.458
Everything!

17:58.542 --> 18:00.750
You're the only one
I can ask for help.

18:00.834 --> 18:02.625
I never said I wanted a kid.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.834
Well, here he is.

18:07.917 --> 18:09.166
'Look at him.'

18:11.208 --> 18:13.917
He's the most amazing thing
in the whole world.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.208
He's got snot all over his face.

18:21.834 --> 18:23.000
Ellis.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.583
Visiting hour's over, okay?

18:34.417 --> 18:35.959
Call you.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.875
I can't.
It's stuck.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.792
(female #2)
'It's a cute onesie.'

18:53.875 --> 18:55.417
'Made it yourself?'

18:55.500 --> 18:57.208
Yeah.

18:57.291 --> 18:58.583
'Keeps me busy at night.'

18:58.667 --> 18:59.875
'Making stuff for him.'

19:01.291 --> 19:02.458
He likes flowers.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.750
Tough times.
The nights.

19:08.834 --> 19:11.709
They don't tell you
how hard it's gonna be.

19:11.792 --> 19:12.792
You know?

19:14.250 --> 19:16.709
I just, I just wish
someone had told me.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.625
She was in a bad way.

19:25.709 --> 19:27.083
Poor girl.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.750
Not a lot of resources
for someone trying

19:28.834 --> 19:31.208
to stay sober
while raising an
infant.

19:31.291 --> 19:33.208
No money, no
babysitter,
nothin'.

19:33.291 --> 19:34.417
I've got a four-year-old

19:34.500 --> 19:36.000
and the limits of your sanity
are pushed

19:36.083 --> 19:38.834
but I've got a great husband,
and a job.

19:38.917 --> 19:40.250
Priscilla was all alone.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.333
Single mother at the end
of her rope

19:44.417 --> 19:45.917
and no one left to turn to.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.583
So why did she
lie
about going to
Ellis

19:47.667 --> 19:49.375
if she wasn't protecting him?

19:49.458 --> 19:52.417
'Cause maybe it wasn't him
she was protecting.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.583
Had the coroner
take a second look

19:53.667 --> 19:55.500
at the autopsy photos of Max.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.917
Anything new?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.333
(Vera)
'Uh, bone fractures
from the blast.'

19:59.417 --> 20:01.417
'Uh, baby got tossed around.'

20:02.667 --> 20:04.709
Some of 'em
are showing calcification.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.417
- Healing.
- Hmm.

20:07.500 --> 20:08.792
Meaning those fractures are old.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.291
We'd know more
if we had a body, but..

20:12.375 --> 20:14.625
Looks like Max was being abused.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.709
Seems like Priscilla
couldn't make a go of it.

20:18.458 --> 20:19.959
[sighs]
Abusing the kid

20:20.041 --> 20:21.542
and it goes too far one night

20:21.625 --> 20:23.500
and sets the fire
to cover it up.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.709
We should have held her
from day one.

20:41.875 --> 20:44.458
(Valens)
'Work says it's been two
days.'

20:44.542 --> 20:46.166
Well, she's probably
under a bridge somewhere.

20:46.250 --> 20:48.542
- 'Back with Ellis.'
- More like guilt creeping
up.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.792
Well, she just bought this.

21:00.083 --> 21:02.333
This doesn't add
up.
All this.

21:02.417 --> 21:03.792
The abuse.

21:03.875 --> 21:05.500
And it seems like
she loved that kid.

21:05.583 --> 21:06.959
Loves her drugs more.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.875
Kids always lose out.

21:09.959 --> 21:12.083
But we know Priscilla
wasn't usin' anymore.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.375
Not back then at least.

21:13.458 --> 21:14.750
Well, she left him
that night though.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.917
All alone.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.667
They think you're too young
to notice, to care.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.375
You won't remember.

21:25.166 --> 21:26.166
You do.

21:29.417 --> 21:31.458
The postmark's from last week.

21:31.542 --> 21:32.917
'Who does Priscilla know
on the Main Line?'

21:34.166 --> 21:35.291
Hmm.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.667
Look at that.

21:39.125 --> 21:40.583
'That's the same address.'

21:41.583 --> 21:43.500
And whoever that is..

21:43.583 --> 21:45.542
...they've been sendin'
her checks she don't cash.

21:48.291 --> 21:51.542
(Mr. Chapin)
I wish we could tell you
where our daughter is

21:51.625 --> 21:56.125
but we've been out of contact
with her for almost four
years.

21:56.208 --> 21:57.458
Because of her drug problem?

21:57.542 --> 21:59.875
We sent her
to an excellent detox
program

21:59.959 --> 22:02.417
when she was a senior
in high school.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.208
She relapsed.

22:04.291 --> 22:05.959
We tried again.

22:06.041 --> 22:07.875
She ran away.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.542
I have to ask you
a delicate question

22:09.625 --> 22:12.041
Mr. and Mrs. Chapin.

22:12.125 --> 22:14.875
Do you think Priscilla was
capable of hurting her child?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.083
Max?

22:19.083 --> 22:21.417
- You wanna say no, but--
- No!

22:25.500 --> 22:27.583
I'm sorry we couldn't
be more helpful.

22:27.667 --> 22:29.000
I can show you out.

22:33.458 --> 22:34.625
Thanks for your time.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.792
You send her money,
Julie.
I know.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.583
No way any mom can shut out
her child completely.

22:47.667 --> 22:48.917
We need to find Priscilla.

22:49.834 --> 22:51.417
She never cashes those checks.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.917
Sometimes, she takes my calls.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.458
- Sometimes.
- Do you know where she is?

22:57.542 --> 22:59.542
I wouldn't know.
She doesn't trust me.

23:01.375 --> 23:02.500
And I don't blame her.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.166
We turned her away, you see.

23:06.250 --> 23:07.583
Right before the fire.

23:14.125 --> 23:15.208
(Julie)
'Aww!'

23:20.041 --> 23:23.375
I'd...like to borrow
some money

23:23.458 --> 23:26.417
'to, uh, take him
to a good doctor'

23:26.500 --> 23:29.291
'to help us move into a
clean,
safe apartment'

23:29.375 --> 23:32.250
and, uh, I understand you
probably feel weird about
that.

23:34.333 --> 23:36.750
And I-I wouldn't ask
if it was just for me.

23:36.834 --> 23:40.792
[clears throat]
There is no realistic
long term plan

23:40.875 --> 23:42.166
for you and this child.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.125
But Max is..

23:48.208 --> 23:50.417
...the only reason
why I'm not using.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.959
He saved my life.

23:52.041 --> 23:54.917
There are people who can give
this child what he needs.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.333
We can help you find them.

23:58.917 --> 23:59.959
What?

24:01.083 --> 24:01.959
No.

24:04.125 --> 24:05.291
I love him.

24:08.875 --> 24:11.667
[sobbing]
He-he loves me, you know.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.709
Maybe that's not good enough.

24:13.792 --> 24:15.834
His parents are drug addicts.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.834
'He may not be..'

24:17.917 --> 24:20.417
'...what you want in a son.'

24:20.500 --> 24:21.750
'Have you ever thought of that?'

24:21.834 --> 24:23.417
But Max is perfect.

24:26.000 --> 24:28.542
He is gonna be better
than all of us.

24:30.291 --> 24:31.625
I'm not giving up my son.

24:31.709 --> 24:33.834
- What about the money?
- You can keep it.

24:36.792 --> 24:39.500
She protected her child
like I never did mine.

24:40.709 --> 24:42.375
What do you know
about the baby's
father?

24:42.458 --> 24:44.458
Could she be with him now?

24:44.542 --> 24:46.875
When she was a teenager,
I used to see him with her.

24:46.959 --> 24:50.792
Those times, I'd drive around
all the places where she..

24:50.875 --> 24:53.041
...used drugs.

24:53.125 --> 24:55.000
If you could tell us
where those places
were.

24:55.083 --> 24:57.500
The 17th Street underpass
was the main one.

25:00.625 --> 25:02.834
If you find Priscilla

25:02.917 --> 25:05.583
please tell her
she can come home.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.125
No strings attached this time.

25:19.583 --> 25:20.959
(Valens)
Happy huntin'.

25:22.875 --> 25:24.083
Home sweet home.

25:24.166 --> 25:26.458
Hey, how you doing, buddy?
Seen this guy?

25:26.542 --> 25:27.750
Ellis Smith?

25:27.834 --> 25:30.083
- No? You seen this dude?
- No?

25:30.166 --> 25:31.125
No?

25:33.250 --> 25:34.709
(Valens)
'No? You seen this guy?'

25:35.959 --> 25:37.250
'He's over there?'

25:37.333 --> 25:38.917
Thanks, man.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.125
Rush.

25:46.542 --> 25:48.583
All you gotta do
is answer my
question.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.041
Quit denting my car, Ellis.

25:52.125 --> 25:53.667
- Hey, Saccardo.
- I don't know where she is.

25:53.750 --> 25:54.917
(Rush)
'We need him conscious.'

25:58.875 --> 26:00.083
Hey, you missed a spot.

26:01.583 --> 26:04.250
- Talk about Priscilla.
- I told him.

26:04.333 --> 26:05.959
I don't know where she is.

26:06.041 --> 26:07.333
I haven't seen her in years.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.959
She was gonna rat you
out,
Ellis.

26:09.041 --> 26:10.709
So you torched her place
to shut her up.

26:10.792 --> 26:11.959
That's crazy.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.542
Where were you,
the night of the
fire?

26:14.625 --> 26:16.709
I was with Priscilla.

26:16.792 --> 26:17.792
The night your kid burned up

26:17.875 --> 26:19.166
you two were hanging out
together?

26:19.250 --> 26:20.542
I didn't know
she left the kid by
itself.

26:20.625 --> 26:22.000
Would you have really cared?

26:22.083 --> 26:24.417
That what you two
lovebirds
were doing that night?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.333
Getting high?

26:26.417 --> 26:28.166
I found her.

26:28.250 --> 26:32.083
She was in a bad way,
you know, jonesin' hard.

26:32.166 --> 26:35.083
I'm not the guy that's gonna
help you make the right
choice.

26:43.625 --> 26:45.125
(Ellis)
'Hey.'

26:45.208 --> 26:46.375
Hi.

26:46.458 --> 26:47.667
'Now, why you wanna walk'

26:47.750 --> 26:49.709
when you can jump
into a warm car?

26:53.208 --> 26:55.250
'Come on, Pris,
it's freezing out there.'

27:06.458 --> 27:07.875
Are you high?

27:07.959 --> 27:09.333
'Oh, I love this stuff.'

27:10.667 --> 27:12.083
Well, the moment I tried it..

27:13.959 --> 27:16.375
...I knew nothing else..

27:16.458 --> 27:17.709
...could compete.

27:21.959 --> 27:23.458
Maybe my parents are right.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.709
Maybe Max would be better off
with somebody else.

27:32.125 --> 27:33.542
Somebody better than me.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.125
It's just so hard to hold on.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.625
Then let go.

27:42.709 --> 27:43.917
'Hey.'

27:45.959 --> 27:47.208
I can fix you up.

27:48.291 --> 27:49.417
Right now.

27:53.792 --> 27:55.083
'Just like old times.'

27:58.208 --> 27:59.458
'Priscilla?'

28:14.959 --> 28:16.041
No.

28:27.542 --> 28:31.291
Priscilla was strong, you
know?
She just walked away.

28:31.375 --> 28:34.208
So, that's five
minutes
you're alibied.

28:34.291 --> 28:36.250
My sister had me picked
up
for jackin' her ride.

28:36.333 --> 28:38.166
- Spent a night in jail.
- Yeah, we'll check that.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.333
Any idea where Priscilla
might be hiding out?

28:45.291 --> 28:47.500
The flower mart, maybe.

28:47.583 --> 28:49.250
'Near the port.'

28:49.333 --> 28:51.083
Hey, she didn't hurt him.

28:51.166 --> 28:52.625
She loved that kid.

28:52.709 --> 28:54.125
Left it all behind for him.

28:54.208 --> 28:55.667
- Tough choice.
- Toughest there is.

28:56.667 --> 28:57.709
You just wouldn't know.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.333
Done with this piece of crap?

29:00.417 --> 29:01.709
Let's go.

29:02.917 --> 29:04.125
That was Nick.

29:04.208 --> 29:05.875
Coroner took a look
at the exhumed body.

29:05.959 --> 29:07.250
Yeah?

29:07.333 --> 29:09.458
Says something ain't right.

29:09.542 --> 29:11.333
Max Chapin
was eight months
old.

29:11.417 --> 29:13.291
He would have had teeth.

29:13.375 --> 29:15.166
Teeth survive fire same as bone.

29:16.834 --> 29:18.458
But there are none
on the jawbone.

29:18.542 --> 29:20.375
Some kids get theirs late.

29:20.458 --> 29:21.917
Yeah, but there's this.

29:22.917 --> 29:25.125
The anterior fontanelle.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.333
- Okay.
- Soft spot, top of the
head.

29:27.417 --> 29:29.792
Closes up from the time
they're born till they're
two.

29:29.875 --> 29:33.000
This skull here, the
fontanel's
three by two centimeters.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.834
'That's too big for
an eight month old like Max.'

29:34.917 --> 29:36.834
Well, what's it
normal sized for?

29:36.917 --> 29:38.250
A four month old.

29:40.583 --> 29:42.125
So this is not Max Chapin.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.250
Uh, it was another kid
who died in that fire.

29:46.333 --> 29:49.625
Well, if this kid ain't
Max,
then who is he?

29:51.041 --> 29:52.458
And where's Priscilla's son?

29:59.792 --> 30:02.542
You're not getting Ellis
Smith.
We're not done with him.

30:02.625 --> 30:05.166
- Did I say anything?
- The fire was just a
diversion.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.834
Whoever set it wanted Max.

30:06.917 --> 30:10.041
And had access to an infant.
One who wouldn't be missed.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.250
So who knew Priscilla would be
out of the apartment that
night?

30:12.333 --> 30:15.041
The ex, Ellis,
but he was in lock-up, right?

30:15.125 --> 30:17.375
Pretty elaborate plan,
kidnapping a baby.

30:17.458 --> 30:18.667
Had to know mom would be gone.

30:18.750 --> 30:20.458
Think I might have
our baby John Doe.

30:20.542 --> 30:24.166
Dropped off at St. Paul's ER,
February 11th, '05.

30:24.250 --> 30:26.208
Severe contusions
and internal bleeding.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.542
There's your abuse.

30:27.625 --> 30:29.083
Died the next day.

30:29.166 --> 30:31.208
And this baby went missing
from the hospital?

30:31.291 --> 30:32.959
Brought down to the morgue.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.917
Then vanished
the day of Priscilla's
fire.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.208
(Stillman)
'Who had access to the morgue?'

30:36.291 --> 30:37.750
(Jeffries)
'About 250 people.'

30:37.834 --> 30:39.208
All the employees.

30:39.291 --> 30:41.667
County hospital, crap security.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.333
Will, you and Kat
go to St. Paul's

30:43.417 --> 30:45.083
find out who admitted
baby John Doe

30:45.166 --> 30:47.583
who was on the shift in NICU,
and the morgue.

30:47.667 --> 30:50.417
'Lil, track down Priscilla.
Try the flower mart.'

30:50.500 --> 30:53.250
There's a crack den
few doors down from 252 Baker.

30:53.333 --> 30:54.583
Desperate souls
if you're lookin' at

30:54.667 --> 30:56.333
who might have taken a kid.

30:56.417 --> 30:58.083
You two talk
to Priscilla together.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.959
I thought about not
leaving him that
night.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.333
It was so cold.

31:42.917 --> 31:44.625
I closed the
window
really tight..

31:46.959 --> 31:48.500
...and I said

31:48.583 --> 31:49.667
"I'll be right back."

31:52.417 --> 31:53.583
'I should have gone home.'

31:56.125 --> 31:57.542
He probably cried for me.

32:00.458 --> 32:02.000
Why didn't I hear him?

32:02.083 --> 32:03.208
Because you left.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.333
Why?

32:09.041 --> 32:10.041
You were right.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.875
- They should have put me away.
- Why did you leave him?

32:13.959 --> 32:15.583
- What does it even matter?
- Oh, it matters.

32:16.667 --> 32:18.166
'Cause I gotta know..

32:18.250 --> 32:21.375
...why a mother would leave
a child all alone like that.

32:25.959 --> 32:27.125
You wouldn't understand.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.583
It's like when you're a kid,
right?

32:43.291 --> 32:45.667
'And yeah, you run out'

32:45.750 --> 32:47.583
'in front of your parents
into the street.'

32:49.750 --> 32:52.375
That's what it's like
when you first start using.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.083
Free.

32:57.166 --> 32:59.083
You're flying, man.
You..

32:59.166 --> 33:01.083
And-and you hear' em
calling out for you

33:01.166 --> 33:03.917
but you don't care, do you?

33:05.917 --> 33:06.875
No.

33:06.959 --> 33:08.208
Next thing you know, you..

33:09.917 --> 33:11.500
You don't know
how to get home no more.

33:14.417 --> 33:15.917
You were finding your way home.

33:17.125 --> 33:18.125
All by yourself.

33:20.750 --> 33:22.166
'Cause you stayed clean
that night.

33:23.792 --> 33:24.834
Didn't you?

33:30.750 --> 33:31.875
Yes.

33:33.208 --> 33:34.750
- I did.
- For your son.

33:37.792 --> 33:38.834
And I know..

33:40.041 --> 33:41.125
'...it's terrible.'

33:42.333 --> 33:43.709
'I left him.'

33:43.792 --> 33:45.458
But, uh, I just thought..

33:47.166 --> 33:49.625
...if I could
make it
through the
night..

33:51.166 --> 33:53.375
...then Max and I would
have
another day together.

34:00.458 --> 34:01.834
Why here, Priscilla?

34:01.917 --> 34:04.500
[sobbing]
It was right
after
he was born..

34:05.792 --> 34:07.166
...when the heat
first went out..

34:13.000 --> 34:15.000
...this was the first
place
I felt hope.

34:18.041 --> 34:19.458
We're gonna find
some place warm.

34:20.542 --> 34:22.458
It's okay, Max. It's okay.

34:28.208 --> 34:29.250
Hi.

34:30.208 --> 34:31.625
Please.

34:38.083 --> 34:40.834
[sobbing]
I just, I can't do this.

35:16.083 --> 35:17.875
Here we are.

35:19.792 --> 35:21.834
We're okay, okay?

35:25.250 --> 35:26.792
I promise.

35:26.875 --> 35:28.542
I'll always keep you warm, Max.

35:30.542 --> 35:32.625
And happy and loved.

35:35.458 --> 35:37.375
And I promise
I'll never leave you, baby.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.458
I promise.

35:51.417 --> 35:52.625
I promised him.

35:56.083 --> 35:57.792
Why did I break
so many promises?

36:04.417 --> 36:06.166
Priscilla..

36:06.250 --> 36:08.458
...we think your son
might be alive.

36:12.792 --> 36:15.208
Who knew that you came here
to the mart that night?

36:15.291 --> 36:18.375
[sobbing]
Ellis. Ellis
knew.

36:18.458 --> 36:20.125
- Who else?
- I don't know, I..

36:20.208 --> 36:22.291
I told that rehab counselor.

36:22.375 --> 36:24.166
The one at Maloney Smith Center?

36:24.250 --> 36:26.375
Lois Rabinski?

36:26.458 --> 36:28.542
I told her it was the only
way
I stayed clean.

36:29.750 --> 36:31.458
She seemed like she understood.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.667
What about my son?

36:36.625 --> 36:38.417
- What about my baby?
- We'll find him.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.166
Where is he, Lois?

36:57.250 --> 36:59.041
- Where's Max?
- Who's Max?

36:59.125 --> 37:00.417
You can't just come
in here and..

37:07.500 --> 37:10.458
Max Chapin is the child
you two kidnapped in 2005.

37:10.542 --> 37:11.875
I'm calling our lawyer.

37:11.959 --> 37:14.291
You took that little baby's
body
from St. Paul's Hospital

37:14.375 --> 37:15.458
where you work, doc.

37:15.542 --> 37:17.000
You set that fire
to cover your tracks.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.834
This is crazy.
Those are outrageous lies.

37:19.917 --> 37:21.208
What? This is our son.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.166
Our son. His name is Isaac.

37:24.250 --> 37:26.125
No, his mother named him Max.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.458
And she wants him back.

37:29.417 --> 37:30.625
(Valens)
'Oh, yeah.'

37:30.709 --> 37:31.750
Priscilla's alive.

37:31.834 --> 37:33.166
You thought she OD'd.

37:33.250 --> 37:34.750
She went so deep down
the rabbit hole

37:34.834 --> 37:36.667
that she wouldn't care
about Max.

37:36.750 --> 37:38.709
- 'But she does.'
- 'Now, she's clean.'

37:38.792 --> 37:40.583
Been clean,
four and a half years.

37:40.667 --> 37:41.875
She misses him so much.

37:43.083 --> 37:44.834
Her little boy.

37:44.917 --> 37:47.834
Who are you talking about?
My wife is Isaac's mother.

37:47.917 --> 37:50.250
- Tom.
- Please, Lois.

37:50.333 --> 37:52.709
We can do this here,
or we can let the DNA test

37:52.792 --> 37:53.875
do the talking.

37:59.959 --> 38:02.500
She was just like
so many others I'd seen..

38:05.417 --> 38:07.083
...who don't care.

38:07.166 --> 38:08.500
Who can't do it.

38:08.583 --> 38:10.375
Sweetheart,
why are you doing this?

38:11.417 --> 38:13.417
The day I met that woman..

38:13.500 --> 38:14.667
Priscilla.

38:16.375 --> 38:19.000
...I had just found out
I had to have another D &
C.

38:20.583 --> 38:21.792
Another miscarriage.

38:24.750 --> 38:26.583
I wanted a baby so badly.

38:29.458 --> 38:30.834
[sobbing]
It wasn't
fair.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.166
'We had so much to give.'

38:32.250 --> 38:33.458
So much love.

38:43.792 --> 38:45.333
That woman couldn't
take care of him.

38:46.959 --> 38:48.875
Just like that other one
abandoned at the hospital

38:48.959 --> 38:51.875
beaten to death,
probably by crackhead
parents.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.959
'That would have been Max.'

38:54.041 --> 38:55.500
We were saving his life.

38:55.583 --> 38:56.917
That's what
you tell yourself, huh?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.792
But you knew the truth.

38:58.875 --> 39:00.333
<i>You saw his room.</i>

39:00.417 --> 39:02.083
<i>It was like walking into a room</i>

39:02.166 --> 39:03.875
<i>filled with a rainbow,</i>
<i>wasn't it?</i>

39:14.000 --> 39:15.875
No, that room was tiny.

39:15.959 --> 39:17.291
It was dirty.

39:17.375 --> 39:18.750
(Lois)
'And then he came home to us.'

39:20.375 --> 39:21.583
Our baby.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.625
[Lois whispering]
'Let's see what we have here.'

39:39.125 --> 39:40.041
Oh!

39:40.125 --> 39:41.375
He wasn't yours.

39:41.458 --> 39:42.792
He never was.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.375
And you must have known that.

39:44.458 --> 39:46.000
'How did you live
with yourself?'

39:48.417 --> 39:49.917
I told myself to forget.

39:51.792 --> 39:52.917
I had to.

39:56.417 --> 39:58.375
Small, so prec..
