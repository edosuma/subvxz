You don't have to
make it that hard.

15:52.458 --> 15:53.458
(GROANS)

15:55.000 --> 15:56.125
WOLVERINE: Got it!

15:56.125 --> 15:58.750
Hey!
Bring that back!

16:05.291 --> 16:08.000
Hey!
How do you
know about me?

16:11.708 --> 16:13.250
(SCREAMING)

16:26.708 --> 16:28.583
Professor,
we have the ruby.

16:28.583 --> 16:30.583
BEAST: And not
a moment too soon.

16:31.375 --> 16:36.125
XAVIER, TELEPATHICALLY: Cain,
recall the day you returned
from boarding school.

16:38.833 --> 16:41.166
XAVIER: Why didn't you ever
visit us during the summer?

16:41.166 --> 16:43.583
I had better
things to do.

16:43.583 --> 16:45.250
(GROANING)

16:46.958 --> 16:49.625
CAIN: Father won't
let me come home.

16:49.625 --> 16:52.208
He likes Charles
better than me.

16:53.291 --> 16:56.708
Cain, Father doesn't
like me more than you.

16:56.708 --> 16:58.750
How did you know
what I was thinking?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.458
You read my mind!

17:01.458 --> 17:03.458
You're a mutie!

17:03.458 --> 17:07.000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.
Please, don't tell anyone.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.750
Mutie! Mutie! Mutie!

17:09.750 --> 17:13.583
XAVIER: Cain,
I was too young
to control my powers.

17:13.583 --> 17:15.708
Can you forgive me?

17:15.708 --> 17:17.833
JUGGERNAUT:
Forgive you?
You're still doing it!

17:17.833 --> 17:20.708
Messing around
where you don't belong!

17:21.958 --> 17:25.083
I made sure
everyone hated you.

17:25.750 --> 17:28.750
Mutie! Mutie! Mutie!

17:28.750 --> 17:30.958
Even Sondra!

17:30.958 --> 17:32.500
(JUGGERNAUT LAUGHING)

17:37.291 --> 17:38.708
What happened?

17:38.708 --> 17:41.000
I thought I was
over all of this.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.708
But I was so young,
and it hurt so much.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.166
Professor...

17:58.166 --> 18:00.333
Do not ask me to
forgive my brother.

18:00.333 --> 18:04.500
Cain is nothing
but a sadistic bully.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.000
He deserves no sympathy
from anyone.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.708
I would not.

18:08.708 --> 18:12.000
I ask only that you
should understand him.

18:12.000 --> 18:16.583
You have taught us not to
let the past control our
hearts.

18:16.583 --> 18:19.583
Tell Beast I shall
be with him shortly.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.208
And thank you.

18:27.250 --> 18:31.500
(TELEPATHICALLY)
Brother, we must talk.
I will meet you in our mind.

18:35.125 --> 18:38.833
The X-Men
have brought
the Ruby of Cyttorak

18:38.833 --> 18:43.000
to give you
back your powers,
to save your life.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.625
Hah. What's in it for you?

18:45.625 --> 18:48.958
The satisfaction of knowing
I saved your life.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.958
That changes nothing.

18:50.958 --> 18:55.458
I'll always be
your living nightmare.

18:55.458 --> 18:58.000
That is my burden to bear.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.833
I don't care.

18:59.833 --> 19:02.333
Can't you get that
through your thick
skull?

19:02.333 --> 19:04.583
Perhaps one day you will.

19:06.875 --> 19:11.625
Whosoever
possesses the sacred
gem shall prepare himself

19:11.625 --> 19:16.375
to receive the power of
the crimson bands of
Cyttorak.

19:16.375 --> 19:21.416
More music!
More dancing!

19:21.416 --> 19:23.333
Read these words,

19:23.333 --> 19:27.583
and go
from this place
a human juggernaut.

19:28.583 --> 19:31.583
Don't let it...
Stop?

19:32.291 --> 19:33.333
(SCREAMS)

19:39.333 --> 19:40.750
(COUGHING)

19:42.583 --> 19:44.500
What happened?

19:48.166 --> 19:50.083
Are you OK?

19:50.083 --> 19:51.958
Oh. Thank you!

19:58.458 --> 20:00.000
(SCREAMING)

20:14.333 --> 20:16.083
Well?

20:16.083 --> 20:20.125
Nobody's
ever gonna mess
with my powers again!

20:25.708 --> 20:28.375
Make your move, tough guy.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.625
Another time, short stuff.

20:30.625 --> 20:32.625
When I'm in the mood.

20:32.625 --> 20:35.750
ROGUE:
I see it and
I don't believe it.

20:35.750 --> 20:37.750
-Do we follow?
-No, Scott.

20:37.750 --> 20:40.250
He chose not to
continue his attack.

20:41.125 --> 20:44.708
I believe that is
his way of saying,
"Thank you."
