{\an8}BANK MANAGER: <font color="#FFFF00">'I see. And what</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">size loan are you looking for?'</font>

00:04.960 --> 00:05.960
7,000 denarii, ideally.

00:05.961 --> 00:08.959
It's for our bar,
The Crown And Toga.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.398
We wanna do a bit of a refurb.
<font color="#FFFF00">OK.</font>

00:10.400 --> 00:12.399
<font color="#FFFF00">What's the nature</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of the refurbishment?</font>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.825
<font color="#00FFFF">Two words - beach bar.</font>

00:13.827 --> 00:15.146
Is one of the ideas
we're toying with.

00:15.147 --> 00:18.146
<font color="#11FF11">Two more words - freak show.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Love it.</font>

00:18.147 --> 00:19.826
And that's literally
never been mentioned.

00:19.827 --> 00:21.146
<font color="#11FF11">Picture a carnival of weirdos.</font>

00:21.147 --> 00:22.147
No, don't picture that.

00:22.148 --> 00:24.146
We're much more into
the beach idea.

00:24.147 --> 00:27.146
<font color="#00FFFF">We're thinking cocktails, beanbags,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">girls in bikinis...</font>

00:27.147 --> 00:29.506
<font color="#11FF11">A bearded baby, a six-legged man...</font>
Will not be there.

00:29.507 --> 00:31.146
Even if they did exist!

00:31.147 --> 00:35.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, either way, your turnover</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">won't reconcile to forecast.</font>

00:35.148 --> 00:37.147
Er... nope. No idea what that means.

00:37.148 --> 00:38.187
<font color="#FFFF00">You don't have any customers.</font>

00:38.188 --> 00:41.147
Yes, because we need a refurb.
<font color="#FFFF00">Or because of poor management?</font>

00:41.148 --> 00:44.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, just grow a pair</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">and give us the money!</font>

00:44.148 --> 00:46.147
<font color="#FFFF00">It's not as simple as that.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Just give us the money.</font>

00:46.148 --> 00:48.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Give us the money.</font>

00:48.148 --> 00:50.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Give us the money!</font>

00:50.148 --> 00:52.147
BELL DINGS
What does that bell mean?

00:52.148 --> 00:54.147
Is that you giving us the money
or...?

00:54.148 --> 00:56.147
You've called security, haven't you?
<font color="#FFFF00">I have, yes.</font>

MUSIC: 'When In Rome'
by Oli Julian

00:58.148 --> 01:00.147
# When in Rome

01:00.148 --> 01:03.148
# Do as the Romans do

01:05.147 --> 01:07.148
# Far from home

01:08.148 --> 01:11.147
# All I got is you... #

01:11.148 --> 01:14.147
<font color="#00FFFF">It's not Grumio's fault</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the guy was a total spod.</font>

01:14.148 --> 01:17.147
No, but it is his fault our business
plan included a six-legged man.

01:17.148 --> 01:20.147
Whatever the fuck that is.
<font color="#11FF11">Exactly what it sounds like.</font>

01:20.148 --> 01:21.187
<font color="#FFFF00">So I'm guessing they said "no".</font>

01:21.188 --> 01:24.147
We got booted out by security
so they didn't really have to.

01:24.148 --> 01:29.147
Either way, our bold, new bid
to lure in punters may have to wait.

01:29.148 --> 01:30.148
MAN: <font color="#00FFFF">GREEN ARMY!</font>

01:30.149 --> 01:33.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, lovely. Chariot fans.</font>

01:33.148 --> 01:35.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Every bloody match day</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">they get steaming drunk</font>

01:35.148 --> 01:38.147
<font color="#FFFF00">and cover the place in flob</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and sexism.</font>

01:38.148 --> 01:39.827
<font color="#00FFFF">'Ey, show us your tits, darling!</font>

01:39.828 --> 01:42.147
<font color="#FFFF00">The zoo knows you've escaped,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">does it?</font>

01:42.148 --> 01:45.508
Yeah, don't speak to my bird
like that, please, fellas.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.147
Oh, dear. Bloody Neanderthals!

01:49.148 --> 01:51.147
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm sorry, "bird"?</font>

01:51.148 --> 01:52.148
Yeah, just using their lingo.

01:52.149 --> 01:55.347
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not your bird, Marcus.</font>
No, sure. I meant girlfriend.

01:55.348 --> 01:57.147
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm not your girlfriend either.</font>

01:57.148 --> 01:58.667
What d'you want me to call you?

01:58.668 --> 02:01.147
<font color="#FFFF00">How about, "Woman you've been on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a few dates with</font>

02:01.148 --> 02:02.148
<font color="#FFFF00">"who runs the business</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">next door to yours?"</font>

02:02.149 --> 02:05.147
Oh, right. Glad we cleared that up.

02:05.148 --> 02:06.987
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, she is right, you know.</font>

02:06.988 --> 02:09.988
<font color="#00FFFF">They really are putting it away.</font>

02:12.148 --> 02:14.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Are you sure there's not</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a pink team?</font>

02:14.148 --> 02:16.507
<font color="#00FFFF">More like one in a pastel shade?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Green's not really my colour.</font>

02:16.508 --> 02:19.147
It is now, mate.
<font color="#11FF11">I got some gear for the bar, too.</font>

02:19.148 --> 02:22.147
<font color="#11FF11">A green banner, some flags, a bibby.</font>

02:22.148 --> 02:24.147
<font color="#00FFFF">What's the bibby for?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Well, a baby.</font>

02:24.148 --> 02:26.148
<font color="#11FF11">Or when I have soup.</font>

02:27.348 --> 02:29.147
<font color="#FFFF00">That'll be 430 denarii.</font>

02:29.148 --> 02:31.347
430? For a bit of cloth?

02:31.348 --> 02:34.147
<font color="#FFFF00">It's official club merchandise.</font>
Hmm.

02:34.148 --> 02:35.347
And is there a discount, perhaps,

02:35.348 --> 02:37.147
for lifelong Greenies
like ourselves? <font color="#FFFF00">No.</font>

02:37.148 --> 02:39.987
<font color="#FFFF00">And nobody says Greenies,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">by the way.</font>

02:39.988 --> 02:41.147
Good to know.

02:41.148 --> 02:43.147
Put the bibby back in that case,
Grumio.

02:43.148 --> 02:45.148
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, I really wanted that bibby.</font>

02:48.508 --> 02:51.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you sure we want</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">sports mad trolls in here?</font>

02:51.148 --> 02:53.147
<font color="#FFFF00">It could all get a bit full on.</font>

02:53.148 --> 02:55.147
If full on means full,
that is fine by me.

02:55.148 --> 02:57.147
Right now, we don't have
a single customer.

02:57.148 --> 03:00.507
<font color="#FFFF00">We've got weird old Phoenix.</font>
Weird old Phoenix isn't a customer.

03:00.508 --> 03:02.667
All he does is drink our water
and use our loo.

03:02.668 --> 03:05.147
He's basically a human drainpipe.

03:05.148 --> 03:07.187
All right, Phoenix?
How's the novel coming along?

03:07.188 --> 03:09.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, slowly.</font>

03:09.148 --> 03:11.347
<font color="#00FFFF">Terribly slowly.</font>
Yeah?

03:11.348 --> 03:14.147
How about a nice glass of wine
to speed things up a bit?

03:14.148 --> 03:18.667
<font color="#00FFFF">Mm, interesting.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Grease the wheels as it were.</font>

03:18.668 --> 03:21.668
<font color="#00FFFF">But, no, thank you.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Let's stay focused.</font>

03:23.148 --> 03:26.148
<font color="#00FFFF">Maybe just a top up of water,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">if you would.</font>

03:29.148 --> 03:30.348
Come on, you Greens (!)

03:33.508 --> 03:35.147
<font color="#11FF11">What's the name of our</font>
<font color="#11FF11">most expensive signing?</font>

03:35.148 --> 03:38.187
<font color="#00FFFF">Alexis Falco, seven and a half</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">million. Where did we get him from?</font>

03:38.188 --> 03:41.147
<font color="#11FF11">The Reds. He used to be scum,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">now he's a legend.</font>

03:41.148 --> 03:45.147
<font color="#00FFFF">What's his pre-match meal?</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Marcus. </font>Who cares?

03:45.148 --> 03:46.148
That is not gonna come up.

03:46.149 --> 03:48.347
All we have to do to blend in,
is make obscene gestures

03:48.348 --> 03:50.147
and shout "wanker" occasionally.

03:50.148 --> 03:53.147
<font color="#00FFFF">The answer is actually meat pie.</font>

03:53.148 --> 03:54.148
<font color="#FFFF00">You want some, you toilet?</font>

03:54.149 --> 03:56.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Is that our geeky bank manager?</font>
Where?

03:56.148 --> 03:59.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Over there with the Blue fans,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">knocking that guy out.</font>

03:59.148 --> 04:02.147
Yeah, cos that's just what
geeky bank managers get up to.

04:02.148 --> 04:05.147
He's probably on his way
to throw shit as a temple.

04:05.148 --> 04:06.148
<font color="#00FFFF">I swear that's him.</font>

04:06.149 --> 04:08.347
<font color="#11FF11">Come on, I quite fancy a pre-match</font>
<font color="#11FF11">meat pie myself.</font>

04:08.348 --> 04:09.508
<font color="#11FF11">Green Army!</font>

04:12.508 --> 04:14.148
CROWD CHEERS

04:19.148 --> 04:20.666
CROWD CHANT: Green Army!

04:20.668 --> 04:22.148
Green Army!

04:27.148 --> 04:29.147
They were the cheapest seats
I could find.

04:29.148 --> 04:31.147
I didn't know
we'd be in the family bit.

04:31.148 --> 04:33.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Cos this definitely isn't</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">where the hardcore drinkers sit.</font>

04:33.148 --> 04:36.148
<font color="#11FF11">Not unless you count milk.</font>
Yes, all right, come on, then.

04:38.148 --> 04:43.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Green Army! </font><font color="#00FFFF">Green Army!</font>

04:43.148 --> 04:46.147
Green Army!
BOTH: <font color="#11FF11">Green Army!</font>

04:46.148 --> 04:48.187
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">did someone order a fruit basket?</font>

04:48.188 --> 04:51.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos three plums have just shown up!</font>

04:51.148 --> 04:53.187
<font color="#00FFFF">Very funny. We're not plums, though.</font>

04:53.188 --> 04:55.187
<font color="#00FFFF">We're Greeners, like you.</font>

04:55.188 --> 04:58.347
If anything, we're green plums.
Greengages, if you will.

04:58.348 --> 05:01.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, well, I ain't seen you before.</font>
Eh?!

05:01.148 --> 05:03.187
That's weird. We're here every week.

05:03.188 --> 05:05.347
<font color="#FFFF00">Oi, Paulus,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you seen these plums before?</font>

05:05.348 --> 05:07.147
<font color="#11FF11">No, never. Who are they?</font>

05:07.148 --> 05:09.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Dunno, saying they're Greeners.</font>

05:09.148 --> 05:11.147
We are! We're massive Greeners.

05:11.148 --> 05:14.187
<font color="#11FF11">All right, you lot are here so much,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who did we play last week?</font>

05:14.188 --> 05:17.507
<font color="#00FFFF">Easy, that'll be the Whites.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We won by three and a half laps.</font>

05:17.508 --> 05:19.147
Yeah, smashed them, the wankers!

05:19.148 --> 05:20.827
Wankers-s-s!

05:20.828 --> 05:22.187
<font color="#11FF11">And you, what do you make of Leo?</font>

05:22.188 --> 05:24.147
<font color="#11FF11">Cor, he was on fire, weren't he,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">eh?!</font>

05:24.148 --> 05:27.667
Oh, yeah. Leo played a blinder,
absolutely immense.

05:27.668 --> 05:29.148
<font color="#11FF11">Leo's our mascot.</font>

05:30.148 --> 05:33.147
No, I know. But, you know,
he was still immense. As a mascot.

05:33.148 --> 05:37.147
<font color="#11FF11">Jog on, you plums.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Ta-ta.</font>

05:37.148 --> 05:39.988
One of our players eats pies
before a race, if that count?

05:43.988 --> 05:47.147
<font color="#11FF11">Well, you muffed that, didn't you?</font>
And you muffed our loan application.

05:47.148 --> 05:49.147
So we're even.

05:49.148 --> 05:51.147
It was a stupid idea anyway.
Let's go home.

05:51.148 --> 05:52.148
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm not just going home, mate.</font>

05:52.149 --> 05:54.147
<font color="#00FFFF">I can win these aggro numpties over.</font>

05:54.148 --> 05:56.147
<font color="#00FFFF">I've got the cheeky charm.</font>
Mm, OK.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.148
I mean, I've never noticed that.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.347
<font color="#00FFFF">You've just gotta</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">tickle their balls,</font>

05:59.348 --> 06:01.147
<font color="#00FFFF">give them a bit of banter.</font>

No. No, thank you. Sorry.

06:07.508 --> 06:10.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Nah, just wondering</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">what you wankers are doing now.</font>

06:10.148 --> 06:12.187

<font color="#11FF11">we're not proper Greeners?</font>

06:22.148 --> 06:23.148

<font color="#00FFFF">I can't pour this stuff fast enough.</font>

07:28.148 --> 07:31.147
This is what having
a successful bar feels like, boys.

07:31.148 --> 07:32.148
Just get used to it.

07:32.149 --> 07:34.147
At this rate,
we'll have to hire more staff.

07:34.148 --> 07:35.507
<font color="#11FF11">Excuse me, Marcus.</font>

07:35.508 --> 07:40.147
<font color="#11FF11">Would you ask the chaps in green</font>
<font color="#11FF11">to quiet it down a bit, please?</font>

07:40.148 --> 07:41.187
<font color="#11FF11">I'm trying to write my novel.</font>

07:41.188 --> 07:44.667
Weirdly, Phoenix, your novel's
not my top priority here.

07:44.668 --> 07:46.827
We are a wine bar for sports fans,

07:46.828 --> 07:49.147
not a water bar for
leaky-bladdered cheapskates.

07:49.148 --> 07:52.147
If you've got a problem with that,
you can jog on, son.

07:52.148 --> 07:55.147
<font color="#11FF11">I'm 75, I'm not jogging anywhere.</font>

07:55.148 --> 07:58.147
Flush yourself down the loo, then,
I really don't care.

07:58.148 --> 07:59.148
What can I get you, mate?

07:59.149 --> 08:02.147
CHANTING: <font color="#11FF11">He's short, he's fast,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">he likes to show his arse...</font>

08:02.148 --> 08:05.668
ALL: He's Grumio, Grumio!

08:06.508 --> 08:08.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Are these not the same chariot fans</font>

08:08.148 --> 08:10.507
<font color="#FFFF00">you described as</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">"bloody Neanderthals" the other day?</font>

08:10.508 --> 08:12.667
They are, yes,

08:12.668 --> 08:14.187
but now I've met them,
and I have to say,

08:14.188 --> 08:16.147
the Greens are
a really terrific bunch.

08:16.148 --> 08:19.147
Genuinely good-hearted,
considerate people.

08:19.148 --> 08:21.147
<font color="#FFFF00">They pissed all over</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">my shop front.</font>

08:21.148 --> 08:23.187
They're a bit rough round the edges.
Sure, they like a drink.

08:23.188 --> 08:26.147
Anyway, I thought urine was useful
for your laundry process.

08:26.148 --> 08:28.827
<font color="#FFFF00">Not when it's streaked</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">all up the wall it's not.</font>

08:28.828 --> 08:31.147
<font color="#FFFF00">And I can't do much with vomit.</font>
Fair point.

08:31.148 --> 08:33.147
Aurelius, clean up the vom as well,
please, mate.

08:33.148 --> 08:35.827
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, this is making me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a bit queasy.</font>

08:35.828 --> 08:37.667
<font color="#FFFF00">They also appear to have</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">painted a dog on my door.</font>

08:37.668 --> 08:40.147
It's a lion, actually. Their mascot,
Leo. <font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I don't care.</font>

08:40.148 --> 08:42.147
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't want it there is my point.</font>

08:42.148 --> 08:43.148
All right,
I'll have it painted over.

08:43.149 --> 08:46.147
In fact,
painting the whole door green

08:46.148 --> 08:47.148
might stop this happening again.

08:47.149 --> 08:50.187
<font color="#FFFF00">Or you can just not have the</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Green pricks in your bar at all.</font>

08:50.188 --> 08:52.147
<font color="#FFFF00">That might also stop it.</font>

08:52.148 --> 08:53.148
No can do, sorry.

08:53.149 --> 08:56.147
We've poured a lot of money
into these Green pricks,

08:56.148 --> 08:58.827
so I kind of need to put my business
before my relationship

08:58.828 --> 09:00.148
with a not girlfriend.

09:02.148 --> 09:05.147
I'll handle it, OK?
Aurelius will clean up the mess.

09:05.148 --> 09:06.148
AURELIUS RETCHES

09:06.149 --> 09:08.148
And his own mess.

09:10.148 --> 09:12.147
HORN BLASTS

09:12.148 --> 09:16.988
CHANTING: Green Army!
Green Army! Green Army! Green Army!

09:22.148 --> 09:23.148
Green Army!

09:27.148 --> 09:29.148
<font color="#11FF11">Go on, boy!</font>
CHEERING

09:32.148 --> 09:36.148
ALL: Whoa-a-a-a-!

09:43.148 --> 09:45.147
No matter how hectic it gets,
just keep serving.

09:45.148 --> 09:47.147
Maybe let's pre-pour drinks,
in fact.

09:47.148 --> 09:50.147
<font color="#FFFF00">And just so you know,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you will get called some rude names.</font>

09:50.148 --> 09:55.147
<font color="#FFFF00">We're talking mug, melt, muppet,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">helmet, ugly bitch,</font>

09:55.148 --> 09:56.148
<font color="#FFFF00">minge face, bearded nonce...</font>

09:56.149 --> 09:58.147
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, I think those last few</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">were just for you.</font>

09:58.148 --> 09:59.827
DOOR CREAKS OPEN

09:59.828 --> 10:02.988
OK, we're on. Brace yourselves.

10:04.148 --> 10:07.348
Green Army! Welcome, boys.
In you come.

10:10.148 --> 10:13.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Glass of wine, please, minge face.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Grumio?</font>

10:13.148 --> 10:14.347
<font color="#11FF11">Just a bowl of nuts.</font>

10:14.348 --> 10:17.147
Sorry, where is everyone?
<font color="#11FF11">They weren't really feeling it.</font>

10:17.148 --> 10:19.147
Why not, out of interest?

10:19.148 --> 10:21.147
<font color="#11FF11">Cos we got dumped out of the Cup,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">didn't we?</font>

10:21.148 --> 10:23.147
<font color="#11FF11">We weren't exactly in the mood</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for having it large.</font>

10:23.148 --> 10:25.347
<font color="#FFFF00">Eh, chin up, kid.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">There's always next season, eh?</font>

10:25.348 --> 10:28.147
<font color="#11FF11">We live in hope.</font>
Sorry, next season?

10:28.148 --> 10:30.147
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">when the Cup starts over again.</font>

10:30.148 --> 10:33.147
So we don't get any more games now?
<font color="#FFFF00">When you're out, you're out.</font>

10:33.148 --> 10:35.147
<font color="#FFFF00">That's how the Cup works,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">silly bollocks.</font>

10:35.148 --> 10:36.148
No, I know. I know that.

10:36.149 --> 10:39.147
Just, um, remind me.
When is next season again?

10:39.148 --> 10:40.827
<font color="#FFFF00">End of August.</font>

10:40.828 --> 10:42.147
August, right.

10:42.148 --> 10:45.147
And it's February now so that's...

10:45.148 --> 10:47.147
<font color="#FFFF00">About six months.</font>

10:47.148 --> 10:50.507
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, the Blues will probably go on</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and win it now. </font><font color="#11FF11">Grr, scum!</font>

10:50.508 --> 10:52.987
<font color="#11FF11">Still, we had a decent run,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">didn't we? </font>Didn't we just.

10:52.988 --> 10:54.348
What a bloody good run we had.

10:57.140 --> 10:58.140
Fuck!

11:00.040 --> 11:01.999
<font color="#FFFF00">But I've only just put them all up.</font>

11:02.000 --> 11:03.199
And now
you have to take them all down.

11:03.200 --> 11:04.999
There's not much point
being a sports bar

11:05.000 --> 11:06.999
if there is no sport for six months,
is there?

11:07.000 --> 11:09.641
<font color="#00FFFF">OK, someone's just had a sweet idea.</font>

11:09.643 --> 11:12.122
Please not the beach bar again.
<font color="#00FFFF">No, not that, hear me out.</font>

11:12.123 --> 11:15.122
<font color="#00FFFF">The Greens got knocked out of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the Cup, but not everyone did.</font>

11:15.123 --> 11:17.122
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, that's how the Cup works,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">silly bollocks.</font>

11:17.123 --> 11:20.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Right, and Paulus said</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">the Blues would probably win it.</font>

11:20.123 --> 11:22.122
<font color="#00FFFF">So why don't we just become</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a Blue bar instead?</font>

11:22.123 --> 11:23.642
<font color="#00FFFF">Have a cheeky rebrand.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">A rebrand?</font>

11:23.643 --> 11:25.122
<font color="#11FF11">Are you tugging my testicles?</font>

11:25.123 --> 11:27.122
That is actually one of your
less shit ideas, Jason.

11:27.123 --> 11:29.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Cheers, bro.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">We're Greeners.</font>

11:29.123 --> 11:31.322
<font color="#11FF11">We can't just change colour</font>
<font color="#11FF11">like some fruity fucking lizard.</font>

11:31.323 --> 11:33.122
I think we can.

11:33.123 --> 11:36.802
In fact, I can feel us turning Blue
right now.

11:36.803 --> 11:39.122
<font color="#11FF11">Where's your loyalty?</font>
<font color="#11FF11">You're bloody glory gobblers!</font>

11:39.123 --> 11:42.122
<font color="#00FFFF">You've been to, like, two games,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">mate. </font><font color="#11FF11">So what?</font>

11:42.123 --> 11:44.122
<font color="#11FF11">The Greeners respect me,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">unlike you two.</font>

11:44.123 --> 11:45.123
<font color="#11FF11">With you it's always,</font>

11:45.124 --> 11:47.322
<font color="#11FF11">"Pipe down, Grumio.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Forget your freak show.</font>

11:47.323 --> 11:50.122
<font color="#11FF11">"Put your bibby back.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Be Green. Be Blue."</font>

11:50.123 --> 11:52.122
Well, yeah, if you would.
<font color="#11FF11">I won't!</font>

11:52.123 --> 11:55.123
<font color="#11FF11">And if this place is going Blue, I'm</font>
<font color="#11FF11">having nothing more to do with it.</font>

11:56.123 --> 11:57.123
<font color="#11FF11">Scum!</font>

11:59.123 --> 12:03.122
Clean that up, will you, Aurelius,
once you're done with that?

12:03.123 --> 12:05.802
Hello again. We'd like to return
these items

12:05.803 --> 12:07.322
and exchange them
for those ones, please.

12:07.323 --> 12:10.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, I thought you were</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">lifelong Greenies.</font>

12:10.123 --> 12:13.962
We were but circumstances changed
and now we're lifelong Blueys.

12:13.963 --> 12:16.162
<font color="#00FFFF">Plus, blue is a much better colour</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">for my skin tone.</font>

12:16.163 --> 12:18.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Right, that's not how most people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">pick a team.</font>

12:18.123 --> 12:20.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, I'm not most people.</font>

12:20.123 --> 12:23.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Either way, we don't do exchanges.</font>
Oh, for...

12:23.123 --> 12:25.122
This is gonna cost us pretty much
everything we made.

12:25.123 --> 12:28.122
<font color="#00FFFF">All right, well, we can get rid of</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this trivia book for starters.</font>

12:28.123 --> 12:30.642
How are we gonna get in
with the fans without wading through

12:30.643 --> 12:32.162
the painfully dull history
of their club?

12:32.163 --> 12:34.483
<font color="#00FFFF">We take a shortcut, obviously.</font>

12:43.123 --> 12:47.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh. Hi. If you want a meeting,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you have to make an appointment.</font>

12:47.123 --> 12:48.123
<font color="#00FFFF">Nah, no need for that, Nige.</font>

12:48.124 --> 12:51.322
<font color="#00FFFF">I just wanted to let you know</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">that I saw you the other day.</font>

12:51.323 --> 12:53.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Yes, I know,</font>

12:53.123 --> 12:55.322
<font color="#FFFF00">I had to call security.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Not here.</font>

12:55.323 --> 12:57.322
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, I did see you here,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">but also at the arena.</font>

12:57.323 --> 13:02.322
<font color="#00FFFF">Yobbing it up, putting your fists</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">hard into people's faces.</font>

13:02.323 --> 13:03.962
<font color="#00FFFF">I saw you.</font>

13:03.963 --> 13:06.122
<font color="#FFFF00">I don't know</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">what you're talking about.</font>

13:06.123 --> 13:08.122
<font color="#00FFFF">So how'd you get those marks</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">on your knuckles?</font>

13:08.123 --> 13:10.963
<font color="#00FFFF">Accident with an abacus, was it?</font>

13:13.123 --> 13:14.123
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, no, you don't.</font>

13:14.124 --> 13:16.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Bell's not gonna save you</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">this time, boy.</font>

13:16.123 --> 13:20.122
<font color="#00FFFF">I know what I saw and I don't have</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">a problem telling this lot</font>

13:20.123 --> 13:22.123
<font color="#00FFFF">exactly what Naughty Nige</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">gets up to after hours.</font>

13:24.123 --> 13:26.482
<font color="#FFFF00">OK, look, maybe I can reconsider</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">that business loan.</font>

13:26.483 --> 13:30.123
<font color="#00FFFF">Nah, forget the loan, Nige.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I want something else this time.</font>

13:32.123 --> 13:35.122
Here he comes. It's Alexis Falco.

13:35.123 --> 13:38.122
The crowd goes mental as he
rounds the final bend and...

13:38.123 --> 13:41.122
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, bollocks to it! </font>Oh, oi, oi!
What you do that for, you mug?

13:41.123 --> 13:42.123
You was home and dry there.

13:42.124 --> 13:44.482
<font color="#11FF11">Sorry, boss. It's just,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I miss the real thing is all.</font>

13:44.483 --> 13:47.122
<font color="#11FF11">Larging it with the lads,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">singing the songs,</font>

13:47.123 --> 13:49.122
<font color="#11FF11">feeling like I'm ten foot tall.</font>

13:49.123 --> 13:51.122
Cos you're on Griff's shoulders,
you mean?

13:51.123 --> 13:52.123
<font color="#11FF11">Yeah, that's part of it.</font>

13:52.124 --> 13:55.122
<font color="#11FF11">But it's like</font>
<font color="#11FF11">I finally belong to something.</font>

13:55.123 --> 13:56.123
<font color="#11FF11">And now all that's gone.</font>

13:56.124 --> 13:58.122
I hear you.

13:58.123 --> 13:59.482
It's always tough,
the wait between matches.

13:59.483 --> 14:03.122
It can feel like forever,
but in just a few days time,

14:03.123 --> 14:07.123
we'll be back on that terrace
giving it large like we never left.

14:08.123 --> 14:10.122
Now, I want you to pick up
little Alexis

14:10.123 --> 14:12.802
and let's get him that victory.

14:12.803 --> 14:14.123
Go on, boy.

14:17.123 --> 14:18.162
<font color="#11FF11">Hang on. A few days?</font>

14:18.163 --> 14:21.122
<font color="#11FF11">I thought it was gonna be</font>
<font color="#11FF11">six months.</font>

14:21.123 --> 14:23.322
What?!
You told him to forget the loan.

14:23.323 --> 14:25.162
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">because we don't need it any more.</font>

14:25.163 --> 14:27.122
<font color="#00FFFF">This is our passport to punters.</font>

14:27.123 --> 14:29.323
<font color="#00FFFF">Ooh, there he is, look.</font>

14:32.643 --> 14:34.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Oi, oi, Nige!</font>

14:34.123 --> 14:37.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Oi, oi, Nige's crew!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Oh, hi, Jase.</font>

14:37.123 --> 14:38.123
<font color="#11FF11">Who are these turnips?</font>

14:38.124 --> 14:41.122
<font color="#FFFF00">These are good mates of mine.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's Jason and, er...</font>

14:41.123 --> 14:42.962
Marcus.
<font color="#FFFF00">..Marcus, yeah, yeah.</font>

14:42.963 --> 14:46.122
<font color="#FFFF00">They own a bar in town.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">The Crown And Toga.</font>

14:46.123 --> 14:47.123
<font color="#00FFFF">It's a hardcore Blue bar.</font>

14:47.124 --> 14:51.122
<font color="#11FF11">Oh, so you're hardcore, are you?</font>
Just a bit.

14:51.123 --> 14:52.802
We're proper Blue Army,
like you guys.

14:52.803 --> 14:55.122
<font color="#11FF11">Blue Army?!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">He means Blue Legion.</font>

14:55.123 --> 14:59.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Blue Legion!</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Jase! It's Legion-n-n.</font>

14:59.123 --> 15:01.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah, Legion-n-n!</font>

15:01.123 --> 15:03.122
<font color="#11FF11">Listen, Nige,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">you sure about these two?</font>

15:03.123 --> 15:04.802
<font color="#11FF11">Seem like a couple of melts to me.</font>

15:04.803 --> 15:06.642
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you calling my mates melts, Gav?</font>

15:06.643 --> 15:09.122
<font color="#11FF11">No, I just mean, they're a bit...</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">I say they're all right.</font>

15:09.123 --> 15:10.962
<font color="#FFFF00">And if you're saying they're not,</font>

15:10.963 --> 15:15.122
<font color="#FFFF00">I'm gonna tear your skin off</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">and wear you like a fucking toga!</font>

15:15.123 --> 15:16.123
<font color="#11FF11">All right! They're all right!</font>

15:16.124 --> 15:18.123
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, they're all right.</font>

15:19.123 --> 15:21.802
<font color="#00FFFF">Legion-n-n!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Legion-n-n!</font>

15:21.803 --> 15:23.123
ALL: Legion-n-n!

15:33.123 --> 15:34.162
<font color="#FFFF00">Whoa, whoa, whoa.</font>

15:34.163 --> 15:38.123
CHANTING: Legion-n-n! Legion-n-n!

15:49.123 --> 15:50.163
Thank you very much.

15:53.323 --> 15:57.122
CHANTING: <font color="#11FF11">Oh, Legion, we love you!</font>

15:57.123 --> 15:59.122
Again, I'm really sorry.

15:59.123 --> 16:01.642
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, painting it green</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">worked an absolute treat, didn't it?</font>

16:01.643 --> 16:03.322
<font color="#FFFF00">And I thought their mascot was</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">a lion.</font>

16:03.323 --> 16:06.122
The Green mascot, yeah.
But we had a small rebrand.

16:06.123 --> 16:09.162
It turns out the Blues have
a far nicer breed of chariot fan.

16:09.163 --> 16:11.162
<font color="#FFFF00">And then what?</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">Are we working our way through</font>

16:11.163 --> 16:13.122
<font color="#FFFF00">the colours of the rainbow?</font>

16:13.123 --> 16:15.122
No, no.
We are now Blue through and through.

16:15.123 --> 16:17.122
Actually, we are making so much,

16:17.123 --> 16:18.162
I could maybe spruce up the hood
a bit.

16:18.163 --> 16:20.642
You know, a few pot plants,
a lantern maybe.

16:20.643 --> 16:22.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Just paint the fucking door, Marcus.</font>

16:22.123 --> 16:25.123
<font color="#FFFF00">And do a better job this time.</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">It's all streaky, look.</font>

16:30.123 --> 16:32.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Nige is like a proper mate now.</font>

16:32.123 --> 16:33.482
<font color="#00FFFF">I mean, I know I'm blackmailing him,</font>

16:33.483 --> 16:36.122
<font color="#00FFFF">but he said he's gonna introduce me</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">to his sister.</font>

16:36.123 --> 16:38.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Apparently, she's well fit.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Shove up, mush.</font>

16:38.123 --> 16:41.122
Sorry, Nigel has described his
own sister as well fit?

16:41.123 --> 16:43.162
<font color="#00FFFF">Yeah! It's quite weird actually,</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">isn't it?</font>

16:43.163 --> 16:45.122
<font color="#11FF11">I said shove up. I need the mirror.</font>

16:45.123 --> 16:46.642
<font color="#00FFFF">Can you just wait until</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm finished?</font>

16:46.643 --> 16:48.122
Why are you even doing that, Grumio?

16:48.123 --> 16:50.122
<font color="#11FF11">I've got a race later,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">why do you think? </font>How can you?

16:50.123 --> 16:52.122
Greens got knocked out of the
Cup, remember?

16:52.123 --> 16:54.122
<font color="#11FF11">That was the</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Chariot Association Cup.</font>

16:54.123 --> 16:56.122
<font color="#11FF11">There's still the League Cup,</font>
<font color="#11FF11">the Fish Paste Cup</font>

16:56.123 --> 16:58.122
<font color="#11FF11">and the Imperial Shield, obviously.</font>

16:58.123 --> 17:00.122
So your season's not over at all?

17:00.123 --> 17:01.482
<font color="#11FF11">Just getting going, son.</font>

17:01.483 --> 17:04.122
<font color="#11FF11">And I'll be back down the bar later</font>
<font color="#11FF11">for some bevvies with the Army.</font>

17:04.123 --> 17:06.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Whoa, hang on.</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">How's that gonna work?</font>

17:06.123 --> 17:08.642
<font color="#00FFFF">I'm gonna be at the bar later</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">with the Legion after our game.</font>

17:08.643 --> 17:10.122
Well, it's not gonna work, clearly.

17:10.123 --> 17:12.122
Grumio, you have to go to the Army,

17:12.123 --> 17:15.122
tell them to go back to that
old pub. The Grapes, was it?

17:15.123 --> 17:17.642
<font color="#11FF11">Like hell I will!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">The Crown And Toga's our manor now.</font>

17:17.643 --> 17:20.122
<font color="#11FF11">We shall not be moved!</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Well, neither shall we.</font>

17:20.123 --> 17:22.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Not from the bar, nor this mirror.</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Argh!</font>

17:22.123 --> 17:27.122
<font color="#11FF11">I can't believe you just</font>
<font color="#11FF11">blued my bloody nose. Scum!</font>

17:27.123 --> 17:30.123
Will you please stop
spitting on the floor?!

17:34.123 --> 17:36.162
<font color="#FFFF00">Are you sure this is gonna work?</font>
Yeah.

17:36.163 --> 17:38.482
<font color="#FFFF00">Cos we could just tell people</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">we're closed.</font>

17:38.483 --> 17:40.122
Nah, this'll be fine...

17:40.123 --> 17:41.123
probably...

17:41.124 --> 17:42.483
hopefully.

17:44.123 --> 17:48.122
BLUES CHANT
<font color="#00FFFF">Legion-n-n, Legion-n-n!</font>

17:48.123 --> 17:51.123
GREENS CHANT
<font color="#11FF11">Greeners, Greeners, Greeners!</font>

18:12.123 --> 18:13.322
Hi, hello there, Nige.

18:13.323 --> 18:15.802
<font color="#FFFF00">What the fuck is going on here?</font>

18:15.803 --> 18:18.122
Um, this is, er...

18:18.123 --> 18:22.122
We're actually closed today,
I'm afraid. <font color="#00FFFF">What, are we?</font>

18:22.123 --> 18:25.962
Yes, because of the
drainage problem, remember?

18:25.963 --> 18:28.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, that'll explain why</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">half your bar's covered in shit.</font>

18:28.123 --> 18:31.122
<font color="#11FF11">There's certainly some shit in here</font>
<font color="#11FF11">all right.</font>

18:31.123 --> 18:32.962
<font color="#11FF11">You should get a plumber in.</font>

18:32.963 --> 18:34.962
<font color="#11FF11">Or maybe pest control.</font>

18:34.963 --> 18:36.122
<font color="#FFFF00">What brings you here, Paulus?</font>

18:36.123 --> 18:39.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Did you get lost</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">on your way home to wanker land?</font>

18:39.123 --> 18:41.122
<font color="#11FF11">I am home, Nigel.</font>

18:41.123 --> 18:43.122
<font color="#11FF11">So you'd best round up your</font>
<font color="#11FF11">little two-bob mob</font>

18:43.123 --> 18:44.482
<font color="#11FF11">and chip off out of here.</font>

18:44.483 --> 18:47.122
Or you can all chip off.
<font color="#FFFF00">We ain't going nowhere.</font>

18:47.123 --> 18:49.962
<font color="#FFFF00">This is our manor and it's Blue!</font>

18:49.963 --> 18:53.122
<font color="#11FF11">You must be going colour-blind</font>
<font color="#11FF11">in your old age, you Toby.</font>

18:53.123 --> 18:54.123
<font color="#11FF11">This manor's Green.</font>

18:54.124 --> 18:56.802
Oh, yeah, says who?
<font color="#11FF11">We do.</font>

18:56.803 --> 18:58.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, prove it, then.</font>

18:58.123 --> 19:00.162
<font color="#00FFFF">Oh, yeah? You want some, you toilet?</font>

19:00.163 --> 19:03.123
CROWD ARGUE

19:05.123 --> 19:07.122
Please, stop! Stop it!

19:07.123 --> 19:08.123
STOP!

19:08.124 --> 19:11.122
Let us not descend into
violence and hatred.

19:11.123 --> 19:12.482
We are better than that.

19:12.483 --> 19:16.642
Let's just, for one magic afternoon,
put our differences aside

19:16.643 --> 19:21.122
and join together
over our shared love of the sport

19:21.123 --> 19:26.122
and the values of brotherhood and
respect and tolerance it promotes.

19:26.123 --> 19:33.123
Surely, deep down, that is what
being a real fan is all about?

19:35.163 --> 19:37.123
<font color="#11FF11">Nah, sod that!</font>

19:51.123 --> 19:53.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Ah, argh!</font>

19:53.123 --> 19:55.122
<font color="#11FF11">Want some, do you?!</font>

19:55.123 --> 19:57.643
Greener!

20:00.643 --> 20:02.123
Oi, Bluey.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.123
<font color="#FFFF00">You!</font>
<font color="#11FF11">Shit... no!</font>

20:14.123 --> 20:16.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Come, bruv, come.</font>

20:16.123 --> 20:17.123
<font color="#11FF11">Fellas!</font>

20:17.124 --> 20:19.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Go!</font>

20:19.123 --> 20:20.123
<font color="#11FF11">Help me!</font>

20:41.123 --> 20:43.123
ALL WHIMPER

20:45.123 --> 20:49.122
Once again, I so, so sorry.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Yeah, I've kind of had enough</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">of this now, Marcus.</font>

20:51.123 --> 20:54.162
What, this, as in the hooligan
damage? Or this, as in me?

20:54.163 --> 20:58.122
Cos I really want you to be my bird
slash girlfriend

20:58.123 --> 21:01.122
slash woman I've been on
a few dates with,

21:01.123 --> 21:03.322
if that particular door's
still open?

21:03.323 --> 21:06.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, the door is off its hinges</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">now, isn't it?</font>

21:06.123 --> 21:09.122
So that's sort of open?

21:09.123 --> 21:10.123
Surely?

21:10.124 --> 21:12.122
<font color="#FFFF00">Fine, it's open.</font>

21:12.123 --> 21:14.322
<font color="#FFFF00">Now get it fixed</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">before I change my mind.</font>

21:14.323 --> 21:16.122
I will repaint it immediately.

21:16.123 --> 21:18.123
<font color="#FFFF00">No, you will buy me a new one,</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">you tight bastard.</font>

21:21.123 --> 21:24.122
<font color="#00FFFF">So, we're not gonna try and get any</font>
<font color="#00FFFF">Red fans down here, I take it?</font>

21:24.123 --> 21:27.122
No. No way.
Chariot fans are far too full on.

21:27.123 --> 21:29.162
<font color="#FFFF00">That is literally what I said</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">at the beginning.</font>

21:29.163 --> 21:31.962
You can obviously have
all of the Green merch, Grumio.

21:31.963 --> 21:33.122
<font color="#11FF11">No, cheers. I'm out, too.</font>

21:33.123 --> 21:35.122
<font color="#11FF11">These chariot mugs talk a good game,</font>

21:35.123 --> 21:37.962
<font color="#11FF11">but when you're on the deck</font>
<font color="#11FF11">being sat on by a bank manager,</font>

21:37.963 --> 21:39.122
<font color="#11FF11">you find out</font>
<font color="#11FF11">who your real mates are.</font>

21:39.123 --> 21:43.122
So the theme for our bar
can go back to being sad and empty.

21:43.123 --> 21:46.122
<font color="#00FFFF">Not quite, look.</font>

21:46.123 --> 21:48.322
Phoenix! Welcome back, old friend.
Glass of water, is it?

21:48.323 --> 21:54.123
<font color="#FFFF00">Well, I need to use the loo first</font>
<font color="#FFFF00">but, yes, water would be lovely.</font>
