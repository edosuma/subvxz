Wait.

08:42.290 --> 08:44.330
Did you just --
Did you just say "phase"?

08:44.330 --> 08:46.710
She just said "phase,"

Cal U faces a tough opponent
tonight in Campbell State.

09:05.540 --> 09:06.670
But before
we can get to that,

09:06.670 --> 09:08.250
we have to address
the elephant in the room --

09:08.250 --> 09:09.750
Cassius Mooney.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.750
Cal U had high hopes for
the top recruit in the country,

09:12.750 --> 09:14.540
but, Kenny,
as we come to the third game,

09:14.540 --> 09:15.920
he's not even in
the starting lineup.

09:15.920 --> 09:18.120
Kenny:
You know what?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.620
I watched him
in the McDonald's game,

09:19.620 --> 09:22.120
and I just knew he was gonna be
in the League.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.920
But now --
I hate to say it --

09:23.920 --> 09:26.880
in this day and age,
if you're not a one-and-done,

09:26.880 --> 09:29.540
you better start
looking for a major.

09:29.540 --> 09:32.750
Ohh. Looks like, uh, lil' man's
having a rough go.

09:32.750 --> 09:34.080
He's a kid.

millions of people

who don't even know you
talking crap about you.

Being a college athlete's

For us with track team,

10:00.670 --> 10:02.710
there's practice,

10:02.710 --> 10:05.500
weights, meets, therapy,

Mm. Paid?

Maybe with an education,

10:10.420 --> 10:11.500
He's broke.

10:11.500 --> 10:12.920
He couldn't afford

Mm-hmm.

gonna finish those poppers.

It's classic market economics.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.750
You know how much colleges make
off these guys?

10:22.750 --> 10:24.290
Like  billions.

10:24.290 --> 10:27.170
Cal U throws out, what,
40K, 50K for a scholy,

10:27.170 --> 10:29.330
but the
basketball program alone

10:29.330 --> 10:30.960
made $75 mil last year,
so...

10:30.960 --> 10:32.710
Wow.
That is so messed up.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.380
Oh, it's real messed up.

10:34.380 --> 10:35.790
Lemme break it down.

10:35.790 --> 10:39.040
Now, you see this network
right here?

10:39.040 --> 10:41.500
Paid $10 billion, with a "B,"

10:41.500 --> 10:44.710
for the rights to play
games like this on television.

10:44.710 --> 10:47.960
Oh, you see this guy right here?
That's the coach.

10:47.960 --> 10:51.460
He makes $7.2 million,
win or lose.

10:51.460 --> 10:53.960
Now, you see these people
sitting in the seat right here,

10:53.960 --> 10:54.960
these great seats?

10:54.960 --> 10:56.330
These are the boosters.

10:56.330 --> 10:59.790
These guys paid $1,700 a pop
to sit in these seats

10:59.790 --> 11:01.920
and $200 for these jerseys

11:01.920 --> 11:06.580
that these 18-year-olds wear
and get no money from.

11:06.580 --> 11:09.000
And for all the money
they make for the university

11:09.000 --> 11:11.710
and the collegiate
athletic system, you know what?

11:11.710 --> 11:14.960
Only less than 1% of them
actually play professionally.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.880
Yeah, that's real messed up.

11:18.120 --> 11:20.880
Once again, the system
profits off the backs

11:20.880 --> 11:23.420
of the black man,
you know?

11:23.420 --> 11:24.710
Or woman.

11:24.710 --> 11:26.250
And we don't get paid
for it.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.750
It's the same
old story.

take these poppers.

11:29.960 --> 11:31.580
Yes.
Grab the ranch, too.

11:33.750 --> 11:36.120
But, I mean, truth be told, your
boy shouldn't be getting paid.

He kind of sucks.

Yeah. Damn.

another rough game,

on campus anymore.

thank you so much.
Eh.

But I'm not done
tutoring Cash.

12:19.000 --> 12:22.000
Well, according to the boosters
and the athletic department,

12:22.000 --> 12:23.080
you most definitely are.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.040
But Cash hasn't even
taken his midterms yet.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.920

Look, I admire what you did
for that kid, truly,

want to help the school out,
