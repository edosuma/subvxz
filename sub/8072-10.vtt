00:15.949 --> 00:16.850
Hello?

00:16.884 --> 00:19.187
ROSEANNE: Hi, Becky.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.155
Something came in the
mail for you today.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.391
OK, well, why
don't you open it,

00:23.424 --> 00:28.062
and if it's anything important,
just call me back later, OK?

00:28.096 --> 00:32.333
Well, hang on, this'll
just take a minute.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.735
Hurry.

00:34.768 --> 00:38.372
Hey, Becky, you've got some
really good coupons, here.

00:38.406 --> 00:41.242
There's $2 off
your dry cleaning,

00:41.275 --> 00:43.744
free sprinkles on
your yogurt cone--

00:43.777 --> 00:45.813
Listen, mom, why
don't you keep that?

00:45.846 --> 00:46.780
ROSEANNE: Are you sure, Becky?

00:46.814 --> 00:49.317
I mean, this is
a $5 value, here.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.984
You could use 'em
when you come down.

00:51.018 --> 00:53.187
No, really, please take them.

00:53.221 --> 00:54.255
I want you to have them.

00:54.288 --> 00:57.258
ROSEANNE: Well, OK,
then, suit yourself.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.359
OK, see you later.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.193
Bye.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.533
This has got to be
some kind of a record.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.435
Not again-- really?

01:07.468 --> 01:09.837
Yeah, every single
time I call over there.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.905
It's so romantic,
all that passion.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.343
When you have to make love
every minute of the day.

01:15.376 --> 01:20.314
Oh, look at how cute "The
Family Circus" is today.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.384
I'm going to have to
call Becky and tell her.

- Hi, Charlotte.

02:20.408 --> 02:22.176
Hey, Mrs. Conner.

02:22.210 --> 02:24.144
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.180
No, I've just got this wife
and mother thing going on.

02:29.082 --> 02:30.384
Boy, you're soaked.

02:30.418 --> 02:32.820
Yeah.

02:32.853 --> 02:38.526
Um, Molly was supposed to
leave the keys in my locker

02:38.559 --> 02:41.595
and she didn't, so I'm
kind of locked out.

02:41.629 --> 02:44.698
Oh, gee, I used to
have an extra key,

02:44.732 --> 02:47.000
but I gave it back to your dad.

02:47.034 --> 02:48.001
Sorry.

02:48.035 --> 02:50.438
Oh, well, that's OK.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.506
Well, thanks anyway.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.142
I'm just going to
go wait outside.

02:55.175 --> 03:00.147
Oh, OK, bye.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.715
Bye.
ROSEANNE: Oh, Charlotte?

03:01.749 --> 03:02.616
Yes?

03:02.650 --> 03:04.452
Is it still raining out there?

03:04.485 --> 03:06.554
Oh, yeah-- hard.

03:06.587 --> 03:09.156
Well, OK, bye.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.491
Bye.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.592
Hey, Charlotte?

03:11.625 --> 03:12.860
Yes?

03:12.893 --> 03:15.229
Would you please get your
butt back in this kitchen?

03:15.263 --> 03:17.465
Yes.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.800
I can't believe it you were
actually going to go stand out

03:19.833 --> 03:21.068
there in the
pouring rain instead

03:21.101 --> 03:23.404
of just asking if you could
hang out here for a while.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.239
Yeah, I just didn't
want to bother you.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.712
That meatloaf you're making?

03:31.745 --> 03:34.915
Yeah, well,
we'll call it that.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.984
I always put
extra yolks in mine.

03:37.017 --> 03:39.019
You know, it's my
special recipe.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.554
You're 17.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.424
You shouldn't have
a meatloaf recipe.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.525
Go get something pierced.

03:48.195 --> 03:52.165
You know, if you don't
mind, I love to cook.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.167
Yeah?

03:54.201 --> 03:58.906
Well, so do I, but
you are the guest.

03:58.939 --> 03:59.873
Hey.

03:59.907 --> 04:00.808
Hey, Darlene.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.877
I'd like you to meet
my new daughter.

04:03.911 --> 04:07.881
Oh, mom, don't make
me share your love.

04:07.915 --> 04:08.816
[door opens]

04:08.849 --> 04:10.050
MOLLY: Hello?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.184
Hi, come on in.

04:11.218 --> 04:13.554
Good thing you're here,
we need a salad, too.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.722
Charlotte, there you are.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.623
Guess what?

04:15.656 --> 04:16.790
You forgot to leave the keys?

04:16.824 --> 04:17.925
Oh, I'm sorry.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.560
I had to get in line for
Daisy Chainsaw tickets.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.762
I can't believe you got them.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.797
You did not.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.265
I did, too.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.501
But those are, like,
impossible to get.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.169
I didn't think
there'd be any left.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.139
Wait a minute, you and I
actually like the same band?

04:32.172 --> 04:35.509
Yeah, well, you know,
don't spread it around.

04:35.543 --> 04:37.745
Don't worry, I've
got a reputation, too.

04:37.778 --> 04:41.549
Yeah, and the cold
sores to prove it.

04:41.582 --> 04:42.450
Girls--

04:42.483 --> 04:43.351
What?

04:43.384 --> 04:45.052
I'm serious about that salad.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.325
Boy, you'd think you'd
be nicer to somebody

04:51.359 --> 04:52.593
with an extra ticket.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.528
You got an extra ticket?

04:54.562 --> 04:56.530
Yeah, do you want to go?

04:56.564 --> 04:59.367
Are they really,
really good seats?

04:59.400 --> 05:01.134
They're tenth row, center.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.035
I'm there.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.637
Uh, just a minute.

05:03.671 --> 05:05.873
Where is the concert at?

05:05.906 --> 05:08.275
It's at the arena in Rockford.

05:08.308 --> 05:12.012
No way, forget about it.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.114
Well, you're not really going
to keep me from going, are you?

05:14.147 --> 05:16.083
I mean, come on.
I'm 16 years old.

05:16.116 --> 05:18.419
Well, that was
going to be my point.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.087
I don't believe this.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.589
Molly's dad is letting her go.

05:21.622 --> 05:24.024
Well, great, then you've
got somebody who'll bring

05:24.057 --> 05:25.959
you back a t-shirt.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.462
Ugh, this is so unfair.

05:28.496 --> 05:29.563
Why don't you trust me?

05:29.597 --> 05:31.699
Because I've seen your work.

05:31.732 --> 05:35.736
I seem to remember a
little incident last year,

05:35.769 --> 05:40.874
with you sneaking off to Chicago
and me grounding you until--

05:40.908 --> 05:43.310
what are you doing
out of your room?

05:43.343 --> 05:44.978
That's 'cause I
didn't tell you.

05:45.012 --> 05:47.180
This time, I'm telling you.

05:47.214 --> 05:49.216
Look, I know your children
haven't behaved perfectly

05:49.249 --> 05:50.684
in the past, but at
some point, you're going

05:50.718 --> 05:52.319
to have to trust one of them.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.590
OK-- Molly, you want to
take DJ to the concert?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.626
Come on, I'm serious.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.861
And that Chicago thing
was over a year ago.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.131
I haven't cut school
once since then.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.266
And with Becky out of the
house, I've had a lot more to do

06:06.299 --> 06:08.769
around here, and I'm doing it.

06:08.802 --> 06:13.407
I'm trying really hard and it
doesn't seem to matter to you.

06:13.441 --> 06:17.344
And might I add, your hair
looks particularly lovely today.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.980
One more word, and
you're not going.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.181
All right, yes!

06:21.214 --> 06:23.216
No, we have to check
with your dad to make sure

06:23.250 --> 06:24.251
he says it's OK.

06:24.284 --> 06:25.152
Oh, he will.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.353
You can convince him.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.188
Yeah, maybe I'll try
that 'particularly lovely

06:28.221 --> 06:29.690
hair' bit on him.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.158
Thanks, mom.

06:31.191 --> 06:32.092
I can go.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.494
Cool, thanks, Mrs. Conner.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.829
I'll pay you half now and half
when I actually see the band.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.104
Gee, Charlotte, you wanted
to go to that concert too,

06:44.137 --> 06:45.005
didn't you?

06:45.038 --> 06:48.509
No, not really.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.011
Well, I could still tell
Darlene that she can't go.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.946
Nah, it wouldn't be fair.

06:52.980 --> 06:55.215
Well, hey, I'm
unreasonable all the time,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.818
and Darlene would never
know the difference.

06:57.851 --> 07:00.087
No, really, I'm fine.

07:00.120 --> 07:03.924
OK, well, if you're
ever sitting over there

07:03.957 --> 07:05.425
and you're lonely
or something, you

07:05.459 --> 07:08.829
know you're welcome to come
over here and hang out any time.

07:08.862 --> 07:09.730
Thanks.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.699
That's really nice, Mrs. Conner.

07:11.732 --> 07:13.734
Roseanne.

07:13.767 --> 07:15.636
OK.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.071
Well, Dan'll be home
in a couple of minutes.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.040
We'd better hurry and
get that dinner done.

07:20.073 --> 07:20.974
Oh, yeah.

07:26.980 --> 07:30.383
No, Becky, don't you get it?

07:30.417 --> 07:35.188
"Marmaduke" is too big
for that small car!

07:35.222 --> 07:37.725
Well, sorry for bothering you.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.026
Bye.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.929
You'd think she'd learn to
take it off the hook by now.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.497
[laughs] That damn pooch.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.367
Woof!

07:51.839 --> 07:53.707
How many of those
did DJ soak you for?

07:53.741 --> 07:54.608
I haven't bought.

07:54.642 --> 07:55.442
I'm just browsing.

07:57.678 --> 08:00.581
What time did we tell
Darlene to be home?

08:00.614 --> 08:02.716
[sighs] After the concert.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.652
That's very vague, dear.

08:04.685 --> 08:07.721
Would that be a month
after the concert?

08:07.755 --> 08:11.458
Do I really have to go through
this again with you, Dan?

08:11.491 --> 08:13.126
OK, the concert
lets out at 11:00.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.695
I told her to come
straight home,

08:14.728 --> 08:15.996
so she'll probably
be here by midnight.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.831
It's an hour and a
half drive from Rockford.

08:17.865 --> 08:20.200
Not the way Molly speeds.

08:20.233 --> 08:23.871
And you know, after she's had
a couple of drinks in her--

08:23.904 --> 08:25.305
I'm serious, honey.

08:25.338 --> 08:28.475
I can't believe we let her go
to a rock concert by herself.

08:28.508 --> 08:32.045
She's not by herself,
Dan, and she's 16.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.147
We can't just lock her up.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.650
Hey, we got a basement.

08:36.684 --> 08:38.318
Now Dan, come here.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.720
Darlene is out for the night.

08:39.753 --> 08:43.023
DJ's sleeping at mom's,
nothing good on TV.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.225
Come over here.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.027
Why, Miss Conner,
you're my boss.

08:49.697 --> 08:52.833
I thought we had a strictly
professional relationship.

08:56.737 --> 09:00.874
Oh, I just can't
help myself, Danny.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.110
Ooh, the way you make my coffee.

09:03.143 --> 09:05.545
The way you walk out of a room.

09:05.579 --> 09:10.818
Ooh, I know why you wear
these skin-tight overalls.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.085
I'm beginning to
think you didn't

09:12.119 --> 09:15.623
hire me for my typing skills.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.024
Hold my calls.

09:21.494 --> 09:22.863
[knocking at door]

09:23.931 --> 09:24.965
Eh, fix your face.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.606
Oh, hi, Charlotte.

09:32.640 --> 09:33.674
Hey, Roseanne.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.475
Uh, I'm sorry to bother you.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.110
- That's OK.
- Thanks.

09:37.144 --> 09:38.411
What do you need?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.580
Um, I'm doing a book report
for school and the library

09:40.614 --> 09:41.715
is closed.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.084
And I noticed that you
guys have encyclopedias.

09:44.117 --> 09:44.918
We do?

09:47.855 --> 09:49.556
Yeah, Dan, don't you remember?

09:49.589 --> 09:54.527
We got A through S, and then we
had to switch grocery stores.

09:54.561 --> 09:58.265
Right, then we got Shop and
Save's "Parade of Presidents,"

09:58.298 --> 10:01.601
but we had to stop at Lincoln
'cause of that bad check thing.

10:01.635 --> 10:05.038
But if you need any
bicentennial dishes,

10:05.072 --> 10:07.007
we have everything except
for the salad plates.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.441
No, that's OK.

10:08.475 --> 10:10.377
Thanks.

10:10.410 --> 10:12.846
I guess I'll just go.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.982
You sure?

10:15.015 --> 10:15.816
Yeah.

10:20.587 --> 10:22.956
Hey, let's try
something, Charlotte.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.025
Right after I
finished talking, then

10:25.058 --> 10:26.626
you say something
back, right away.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.698
Um, my dad's working
the night shift

10:30.731 --> 10:31.999
and Molly's out with Darlene.

10:32.032 --> 10:33.934
And I'd never been alone
in a new house before,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.336
and I made you some snacks.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.938
Well, you know I told
you, you could come over

10:37.971 --> 10:39.773
here and hang out any time.

10:39.807 --> 10:41.308
You don't have to bring
food every single time

10:41.341 --> 10:43.376
you come over here.
Just you is enough--

10:43.410 --> 10:44.544
got it?
- Yes.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.684
Oh, no--

10:50.718 --> 10:51.819
Rice Krispie treats.

10:51.852 --> 10:52.652
Over here!

11:07.768 --> 11:09.870
Come on, Molly, let's go.

11:09.903 --> 11:11.004
It's getting late.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.740
Excuse me.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.574
So cute-- which one do you want?

11:14.607 --> 11:18.245
The one that will kill you
and stuff you into a trunk.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.646
Come on, would you lighten up?

11:19.679 --> 11:21.181
Look, I have a boyfriend.

11:21.214 --> 11:22.215
I don't need these jerks.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.283
Now can we get out here?

11:23.316 --> 11:24.451
It's been like, an
hour and a half.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.586
Well, it's my car and
I'm not ready to go.

11:26.619 --> 11:28.756
I'm still looking for
the perfect guy, OK?

11:28.789 --> 11:30.657
Oh, it's a good thing
we're in a parking

11:30.690 --> 11:33.426
lot full of drunken losers.

11:33.460 --> 11:37.464
It shouldn't be hard to
spot that white horse.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.266
So you guys coming, or what?

11:39.299 --> 11:40.633
Well, I'm definitely
going to go.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.102
But Darlene here,
is kind of shy.

11:42.135 --> 11:43.536
Well, look, we don't
have to go anywhere.

11:43.570 --> 11:44.938
I got a couple of
joints in the van.

11:44.972 --> 11:47.140
Yeah, Darlene, you
look like a real partier.

11:47.174 --> 11:51.411
Any part of you that touches
me, you're not getting back.

11:51.444 --> 11:52.880
I'm going without you.

11:52.913 --> 11:54.982
I'm not standing in
this parking lot alone.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.449
Give me the keys
and I'll drive home.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.517
Let Sean drive you home.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.451
Yeah, I'll drive you home.

11:58.485 --> 11:59.953
Oh, god.

11:59.987 --> 12:01.488
Look, just 15
minutes, I promise.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.060
Mm, so, Darlene, did you--

12:07.094 --> 12:08.428
Just stop right
there, Pony Boy.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.200
You and the rest of
yours "Outsiders"

12:13.233 --> 12:14.768
can go rumble someplace else.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.841
Look, I apologize
for my friend.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.576
I mean, he's a real jerk.

12:23.610 --> 12:25.813
I mean, it's obviously a bad
idea to go into someone's

12:25.846 --> 12:28.081
van you hardly even know.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.017
So it's lucky for you, I happen
to have a couple of joints

12:30.050 --> 12:31.618
right here.

12:31.651 --> 12:33.921
Oh man, I feel like I'm
in the middle of a really

12:33.954 --> 12:35.022
bad after-school special.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.064
[crickets chirping]

12:48.535 --> 12:51.972
JACKIE: Yeah, Gil, they're
in a blue '83 Celica.

12:52.005 --> 12:55.375
It's Darlene and another
girl, Molly Tilden.

12:55.408 --> 12:58.678
No, we haven't been able to get
in touch with her father yet.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.814
What was Molly wearing?
- Oh, a black mini-skirt.

13:00.848 --> 13:01.714
Black mini-skirt.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.450
And it was a half-shirt.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.852
A crop top.

13:04.885 --> 13:07.020
And a sweater she always wears
when she goes out to get guys.

13:07.054 --> 13:09.256
Guy-getting sweater.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.791
Who the hell is
she talking to?

13:11.825 --> 13:13.726
Well, gee, it's
4:00 in the morning.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.097
I think she's ordering a couple
things from Spiegel catalog.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.198
Get her off the phone.

13:18.231 --> 13:19.566
Darlene could be
trying to call through.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.501
Charlotte, go home and check
your answering machine, again.

13:21.534 --> 13:24.704
Yes, sir.

13:24.737 --> 13:25.939
I'm going back outside.

13:25.973 --> 13:27.374
I want to stand in the
middle of the street, where

13:27.407 --> 13:29.109
the first thing she'll
see when she pulls up

13:29.142 --> 13:32.279
is my head exploding.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.915
Gil gets accident reports
from all the hospitals.

13:34.948 --> 13:36.850
He hasn't heard anything.

13:36.884 --> 13:38.185
God, where could they be?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.020
I'm going to go out and
drive around a little.

13:40.053 --> 13:41.855
I'm sure there's nothing
to worry about, hon.

13:41.889 --> 13:44.391
Car might've broken down,
they might have pulled off

13:44.424 --> 13:46.226
the road somewhere
and could be wandering

13:46.259 --> 13:47.961
down some deserted
highway, looking

13:47.995 --> 13:49.062
for anybody to pick them up.

13:52.299 --> 13:54.067
I'll go look.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.035
DAN: Did something happen?

13:55.068 --> 13:56.003
You hear something?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.638
No.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.040
[door shuts]

14:01.108 --> 14:02.542
Don't.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.411
You said, let her go.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.313
I said, don't.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.315
She could be out
there, God knows where.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.516
God knows what happened to her.

14:09.549 --> 14:10.750
This never would
have happened if you

14:10.783 --> 14:12.419
would have listened to me.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.088
A 16-year-old kid shouldn't
go to no rock concert.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.323
Yeah, you're right, Dan.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.426
Only middle-aged couples
should go to rock concerts.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.461
You're not off
the hook for this.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.729
You let it go all
the way to Rockford.

14:22.762 --> 14:24.497
You let her do whatever
the hell she wants.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.066
And this time--

14:26.099 --> 14:27.700
I don't even want to
think about this time.

14:27.734 --> 14:29.436
So why don't you just
go ahead and say it?

14:29.469 --> 14:31.638
Go on, just say,
I'm a lousy mother.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.173
There, you feel better?

14:33.206 --> 14:35.108
Yeah, maybe this time,
something will happen to her.

14:35.142 --> 14:37.110
And then you can be
Lord God King Right.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.912
Yeah, Roseanne, that's
exactly what I'm looking for.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.713
[door opens]
- I want--

14:40.747 --> 14:42.382
Don't even bother
yelling at me

14:42.415 --> 14:43.683
because no matter
how mad you are,

14:43.716 --> 14:45.685
you're nowhere near
as mad as I am.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.753
ROSEANNE: Well, don't bet on it.

14:46.786 --> 14:48.455
Where in the hell have you been?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.090
Trying to get home.

14:50.123 --> 14:53.426
That skank woman, Molly, left
me stranded in the parking lot

14:53.460 --> 14:57.064
so she could jump in a van with
some guys after the concert.

14:57.097 --> 14:58.831
I finally had to
wave down a cab.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.600
I don't care
what your story is.

15:00.633 --> 15:02.469
The rule is, you call.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.104
It was a bad neighborhood.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.472
When I finally
found a phone booth,

15:05.505 --> 15:07.274
I got tired of waiting for the
guy in it to finish peeing.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.044
Look, I know I
should have called,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.879
but I just wanted to get home.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.314
You expect us to believe that?

15:14.347 --> 15:16.649
Well, if you don't, just
go ask the cab driver.

15:16.683 --> 15:17.884
He's waiting
outside for his $75.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.190
Oh, man.

15:23.223 --> 15:25.258
The grocery money's
on top of the fridge.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.426
DAN: [coughs]

15:27.927 --> 15:30.363
What were you doing talking
to some guys in a van?

15:30.397 --> 15:31.864
It wasn't me, it was her.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.733
I told you that.
[phone rings]

15:33.766 --> 15:35.568
Right, she deserted you.

15:35.602 --> 15:38.305
What, you don't believe
that Molly would desert me?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.007
Why, because she's
so sweet and cute

15:40.040 --> 15:41.474
and says 'please' and
'thank you, ma'am'?

15:41.508 --> 15:43.376
ROSEANNE: No, because she
doesn't have a history

15:43.410 --> 15:44.777
of lying to me like you do.

15:44.811 --> 15:45.678
DAN: That was Charlotte.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.047
She just heard from Molly.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.316
Darlene, you'll be relieved
to know that right now, you're

15:49.349 --> 15:50.984
in Molly's car,
driving back with her,

15:51.018 --> 15:52.485
and you'll be home
safe in about an hour.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.525
I'll accept your apology
over eggs and French toast

15:58.558 --> 15:59.359
in the morning.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.663
Or, you know, you
could just ground me,

16:03.696 --> 16:04.631
and that'd be OK, too.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.373
Why does she buy
this brand of waffles?

16:13.406 --> 16:14.407
I hate these waffles.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.575
(THROUGH GRITTED
TEETH) Well, you

16:15.608 --> 16:17.177
know you could solve
that problem by having

16:17.210 --> 16:20.847
breakfast in your own house.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.849
Hi.

16:22.882 --> 16:23.750
Hey.
DAN: Hey.

16:23.783 --> 16:24.751
JACKIE: Hi.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.119
Well, for a guy working
the night shift,

16:26.153 --> 16:27.020
you're up pretty early.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.921
Or awful late--

16:28.955 --> 16:29.956
care for a night-cap?

16:29.989 --> 16:31.158
Yeah, in a minute.

16:31.191 --> 16:35.095
We got something to
clear up first, right?

16:35.128 --> 16:37.064
I'm really sorry
about last night.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.365
And I hope you're
not mad at Darlene

16:38.398 --> 16:41.101
for coming home so late,
'cause it was all my fault.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.302
Apology accepted.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.137
We're just thankful
everybody's OK.

16:44.171 --> 16:48.007
I'm going to go upstairs
and apologize to Darlene.

16:48.041 --> 16:51.111
Oh, man, daughters-- they
ought to come with a handbook.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.346
Yeah, so you can
smack them with it.

16:53.380 --> 16:55.082
TY: [chuckles]

16:55.115 --> 16:56.449
You know, Dan, look at me.

16:56.483 --> 16:58.485
I'm working all the time.

16:58.518 --> 16:59.586
These kids don't have a mother.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.887
I mean, it's getting tough.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.422
I mean, Charlotte,
she's a dream.

17:02.455 --> 17:04.824
But Molly-- she's
a real handful.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.825
A real handful?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.627
That's one way of putting it.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.162
Well, I'm just
really glad the guard

17:09.196 --> 17:11.831
let her go back to the
building to get her purse.

17:11.864 --> 17:16.303
I'm-- I'm not sure
Darlene told me about that.

17:16.336 --> 17:19.972
Well, Darlene got tired of
waiting, so she left for home.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.374
And I'll tell you,
I don't blame her,

17:21.408 --> 17:23.042
because if you go
somewhere with Molly,

17:23.076 --> 17:25.044
she always leave
something behind

17:25.078 --> 17:27.780
and it takes about a
year for her to find it.

17:27.814 --> 17:30.217
Wow, a less-trusting
parent might

17:30.250 --> 17:31.884
think you could
drive a van through

17:31.918 --> 17:33.386
the holes in that story.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.687
TY: Well, they don't
know my daughter.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.588
I do.

17:35.622 --> 17:37.657
Well, I guess.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.992
Now, listen, sometimes
you got to give your kids

17:40.026 --> 17:41.861
the benefit of the doubt.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.763
Nah, you give murderers
the benefit of the doubt.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.933
These are your kids.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.536
Dan, I trust my kids.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.604
And all I'm hoping for
is I raised them right

17:51.638 --> 17:52.739
so they do right.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.073
That's it.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.175
Whatever works.

17:55.208 --> 17:56.476
Why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

17:56.509 --> 17:57.344
Sleep?

17:57.377 --> 17:58.678
Ha.

17:58.711 --> 17:59.946
[grunts] Ow.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.914
And I'll get started on
that early grave for you.

18:05.752 --> 18:07.287
JACKIE: (WHISPERING)
Can you believe that?

18:07.320 --> 18:10.056
That kid's got him
totally snowed.

18:10.089 --> 18:16.229
Yeah, makes you realize, there
but for the grace of God goes--

18:16.263 --> 18:19.566
well, some parent
with good kids.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.201
Well, we can't
leave it like this.

18:21.234 --> 18:22.202
What are you going to do?

18:22.235 --> 18:23.936
[slurps]

18:23.970 --> 18:25.405
I know exactly what
I'm going to do.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.577
Rosie!

18:30.610 --> 18:32.645
Come on, my butt's
on the line, here.

18:32.679 --> 18:34.214
Won't you even listen to me?

18:34.247 --> 18:36.249
No, we spent enough
time in life together.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.785
We're done now.

18:38.818 --> 18:41.754
You didn't tell your parents
what really happened, did you?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.055
Most of it.

18:43.089 --> 18:45.425
My mom never would've bought
that I-lost-my-purse crap,

18:45.458 --> 18:46.226
anyway.
[door opens]

18:46.259 --> 18:47.427
Oh, I don't know.
Try me.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.562
I'm not as good when
I haven't slept.

18:49.596 --> 18:50.963
Hi, Mrs. Conner.

18:50.997 --> 18:51.864
I'm really about--

18:51.898 --> 18:53.466
No, you're not.

18:53.500 --> 18:55.168
But you will be.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.236
Darlene-- out.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.437
In a minute--

18:57.470 --> 19:00.840
I seem to have misplaced
my purse, here, somewhere.

19:00.873 --> 19:04.076
Darlene-- out.

19:04.110 --> 19:06.446
So, Molly--

19:06.479 --> 19:08.215
Look, I know what
Darlene told you--

19:08.248 --> 19:09.516
ROSEANNE: Let's just
cut the crap, OK?

19:09.549 --> 19:11.284
You're talking to
Darlene's mother, here--

19:11.318 --> 19:12.485
the mother of all mothers.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.087
And she is majorly mad!

19:15.121 --> 19:16.989
Now maybe your father's
too busy to see

19:17.023 --> 19:18.191
what you're trying
to get away with,

19:18.225 --> 19:20.059
but don't even waste
that story on me.

19:20.092 --> 19:24.331
- It wasn't a story.
- Molly, Molly, Molly--

19:24.364 --> 19:29.135
I have raised two of the best
damn liars in the free world.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.870
Don't embarrass yourself.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.805
Why are you ragging on me?

19:32.839 --> 19:35.475
'Cause that's what I do.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.809
I did it with Becky.

19:36.843 --> 19:38.044
I do it with Darlene.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.679
But doing it with
you is even more fun

19:39.712 --> 19:41.781
because I can yell at
you all I want, and I

19:41.814 --> 19:44.251
don't have to buy you a car.

19:44.284 --> 19:46.286
Yeah, that's right,
'cause you're not my mother.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.087
Fine-- since I'm
not your mother,

19:48.120 --> 19:51.224
then I'm not going to tell
you how stupid it is to get

19:51.258 --> 19:53.326
into some stranger's van.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.694
And I'm also not
going to tell you

19:54.727 --> 19:56.863
how terrible things happen
to stupid little girls

19:56.896 --> 19:58.231
like you every single day.

19:58.265 --> 19:59.532
I don't have to
listen to this--

19:59.566 --> 20:02.269
Oh, but I think you do.

20:02.302 --> 20:03.636
Now you want to
screw up your life?

20:03.670 --> 20:04.771
I don't care.

20:04.804 --> 20:06.606
But when you leave this
house with a Conner kid,

20:06.639 --> 20:08.708
you're going to
be extra careful.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.511
'Cause Darlene is one of the
few things we own outright.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.618
I get it, OK?

20:18.651 --> 20:21.153
OK.

20:21.187 --> 20:24.957
And you are going
to pay me back

20:24.991 --> 20:26.793
for Darlene's cab ride home.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.094
Yes, I'll pay you back.

20:28.127 --> 20:29.496
Yeah, you're damn
right you will,

20:29.529 --> 20:31.264
because you're going
to work it off washing

20:31.298 --> 20:33.333
dishes at the diner--

20:33.366 --> 20:36.135
all $150 of it.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.541

20:46.579 --> 20:47.547
DAN: Woof!

20:47.580 --> 20:48.948
[laughs]

20:50.517 --> 20:51.718
That damn dog.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.056
Was that the last candy bar?

20:57.089 --> 20:58.257
Yeah, that's the last one.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.927
Well, I guess maybe DJ
won that prize after all.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.295
Oh, great, he sold them all?

21:02.329 --> 21:06.366
Well, if that's the last
one, where else would they go?

21:06.399 --> 21:08.167
Did you eat any?

21:08.200 --> 21:09.068
A couple.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.304
Well, I ate a couple.

21:11.338 --> 21:12.739
Darlene ate a couple.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.206
And Jackie's
having her period.

21:22.549 --> 21:27.820
Well, I guess at $3 a pop,
we've bought DJ a $60 wood-chip

21:27.854 --> 21:29.021
pencil case.

21:29.055 --> 21:31.324
Woof.

21:31.358 --> 21:36.696
[laughs] Ah, well,
but hey, let's not

21:36.729 --> 21:38.731
waste that chocolate buzz.

21:38.765 --> 21:39.566
Woof!
