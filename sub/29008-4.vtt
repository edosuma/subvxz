WEBVTT

00:09.120 --> 00:10.640
And then they'll kill you.

00:11.760 --> 00:13.320
You're dead, anyway.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.400
For fuck's sake....

00:18.680 --> 00:20.400
For fuck's sake, man.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.520
Come on, man.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.480
-On your knees.
-No.

00:33.080 --> 00:34.280
Please, don't kill me.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.200
SATURDAY
12:30 PM

00:38.160 --> 00:39.320
Don't look at me.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.880
Don't look at me.

00:43.480 --> 00:45.320
-Please, don't.
-Don't fucking look at me.

00:45.400 --> 00:47.120
Don't fucking look at me.

01:02.400 --> 01:03.600
What the hell was that?

01:03.760 --> 01:06.120
26 HOURS OF ROBBERY

01:06.200 --> 01:07.320
What happened?

01:07.400 --> 01:08.680
Calm down, Jesus!

01:08.760 --> 01:11.040
Calm down. Have some fucking strength,

01:11.120 --> 01:14.720
or we won't get out alive, right?
You have to give it some balls.

01:34.920 --> 01:35.880
Thanks.

01:36.200 --> 01:37.400
Shut up, shut up.

01:37.480 --> 01:38.360
-Thanks.
-Shut up.

01:38.720 --> 01:41.680
Thanks. Tell them you killed me
and you got rid of the body.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.640
-I'll hide.
-Where the fuck will you hide?

01:43.800 --> 01:44.920
In vault 2.

01:45.320 --> 01:48.440
I've got the fingerprint. Nobody will get
in. I'll hide. Tell them you killed me.

01:48.600 --> 01:51.120
-Tell them.
-There's not a single drop of blood.

01:51.280 --> 01:54.000
-There's not a single drop of blood.
-Shoot me here, come on.

01:54.080 --> 01:55.920
-Shoot me in the hand.
-Don't talk nonsense.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.600
-Shoot me.
-For fuck's sake!

01:57.680 --> 01:58.680
-In my shoulder.
-The shoulder?

01:58.760 --> 01:59.760
Shoot me in the shoulder.

01:59.840 --> 02:02.520
The shoulder is so close to the lung.
I can't do it.

02:02.840 --> 02:05.040
In my thigh, it bleeds a lot.
I've seen it.

02:05.120 --> 02:08.280
My brother got hurt with an iron
and he bled a lot. Come on. Come.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.480
Bite my hand if you want.

02:30.000 --> 02:31.800
Okay, okay.

02:32.400 --> 02:33.360
Okay.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.080
-Okay, okay.
-No!

03:03.800 --> 03:05.120
Two shots...

03:07.120 --> 03:10.560
Have you got bad aim
or do blondes get you nervous?

03:11.400 --> 03:13.760
If she grabs your knee
and begs you not to kill her,

03:13.840 --> 03:14.720
it's not easy.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.040
Why didn't you kill her?

03:21.400 --> 03:22.960
You're a fucking bastard.

03:23.200 --> 03:26.080
You don't want to stain your hands
with blood, but you stain mine.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.120
If you ever touch me again, you're dead.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.960
There's a coal boiler in the basement.
Put her inside.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.240
Later you'll clean all this.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.440
Paula?

05:17.320 --> 05:19.520
Paula, honey! Where are you?

05:19.680 --> 05:21.400
Where are you, Paula?

05:22.080 --> 05:23.400
Paula, honey!

05:25.320 --> 05:26.360
Paula...

05:32.080 --> 05:34.440
"Now I don't live in AlmazÃ¡n.
I live in Madrid.

05:35.360 --> 05:38.440
The bus that goes downtown is number 21.

05:39.480 --> 05:42.080
I've got two daughters.
The keys are in a drawer in the hall.

05:42.240 --> 05:44.400
I live with Raquel and Paula.
My brother is sick.

05:44.560 --> 05:47.000
The keys are...
I've got two daughters. Raquel is...

05:47.160 --> 05:48.760
Paula always has her way.

05:48.920 --> 05:51.600
Paula's father
has got a restraining order.

05:52.120 --> 05:55.120
Never let Paula go with her father."

06:16.080 --> 06:17.040
Hello?

06:17.920 --> 06:21.240
Professor, the one hour term
I gave you has finished.

06:21.800 --> 06:23.680
I need to know
if you're going to surrender.

06:24.640 --> 06:27.240
When you were a child,
what games did you play in the playground?

06:31.960 --> 06:33.680
With... the jump rope,

06:34.320 --> 06:36.680
"hitting the can, the donkey...."

06:38.400 --> 06:40.840
I played ladybirds too.
I was very good at that.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.880
"I played cops and robbers."

06:43.360 --> 06:44.240
Is it familiar?

06:44.640 --> 06:47.000
Some of us played cops
and had to catch the others

06:47.080 --> 06:50.560
and when they got you, they got you,
but I don't remember a single child

06:50.640 --> 06:54.520
in that playground who surrendered
before he was caught.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.760
Children in the school playground
do not risk going to prison

06:58.840 --> 07:00.080
for 8 or 16 years.

07:00.680 --> 07:03.200
You're right. You're absolutely right.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.440
That's why I asked my mates.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.600
"We voted, and you know what?"

07:09.200 --> 07:10.520
We're enthusiasts.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.560
Finally we've decided
to go for the zero years in prison.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.200
"Hello, it's Raquel.
I can't answer right now.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.920
If it's something urgent,
leave a message after the beep."

07:26.320 --> 07:29.240
A lot of people are suffering.
What do you plan to do?

07:29.720 --> 07:31.080
Take paper and a pen.

07:32.880 --> 07:34.120
"I need a lorry"

07:34.280 --> 07:36.840
a 3-axle one,
with a trailer for 18 tonnes,

07:36.920 --> 07:40.000
two more tankers,
with propane gas to escort it

07:40.080 --> 07:43.000
and the ship Malaika with flag
from Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.680
Is it familiar?
It's the one seized nine months ago

07:45.760 --> 07:47.440
with 2,800 kilos of cocaine.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.560
It's docked at Ferrol's military port.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.560
It'll won't be easy to get
the green light to your requests,

07:53.240 --> 07:56.280
due to... logistic issues,
safety issues....

07:57.600 --> 07:58.840
Imagine this:

08:00.320 --> 08:05.080
a building collapses
and there are 67 people inside.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.480
How many arrangements do you think
they would approve to save

08:09.560 --> 08:12.840
the lives of those innocent people?
Inspector, let's be clear.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.800
You only have two choices.
One: to punish us. Two: to save lives.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.960
And I'm afraid
you can't choose both things.

08:21.000 --> 08:22.960
"You have a new message.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.840
Mum, I've just finished. I'm on my way.

08:25.320 --> 08:27.680
To call back, press 1."

08:30.240 --> 08:31.720
I'm going to promise you one thing.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.160
If you refuse to punish us,

08:39.240 --> 08:42.320
I'll give you those 67 hostages
in perfect health,

08:42.400 --> 08:44.240
when we are in international waters.

08:44.320 --> 08:46.440
And I assure that's not
the first choice I had.

08:46.520 --> 08:49.000
I hate the sea, the fish
and the sand on the beach.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.760
"But life don't always give you
an easy way out, don't you think?"

08:59.280 --> 09:02.680
"I got a message from my daughter
this morning, from that phone.

09:02.760 --> 09:07.400
I don't... I'm Raquel Murillo's mother.
And I can't locate her.

09:07.680 --> 09:10.600
Please, do you know where she is?
It's urgent."

09:14.120 --> 09:16.800
We're bringing that lorry
to get them out of that mouse trap.

09:16.880 --> 09:18.720
It'll be easier for us in the open field.

09:19.240 --> 09:21.400
Let's get the vehicles ready
with narcotic gas.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.840
-They're not coming out.
-How do you know?

09:24.080 --> 09:27.080
They opened that vault,
but they didn't want the money.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.000
They waited for the police.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.080
They shot.

09:34.080 --> 09:36.200
"They dropped two bags,
coincidentally open,

09:36.280 --> 09:38.520
dispersing the notes in the street."

09:40.080 --> 09:42.040
-So?
-They wanted to pretend they were trapped

09:42.120 --> 09:43.960
to win two days of negotiation.

09:44.120 --> 09:45.880
But they're inside on purpose.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.320
With a Browning machine gun,
red overalls, masks and everything.

09:51.600 --> 09:54.400
They triggered the alarm
two hours after they had come in.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.520
"Once they had opened the safe vault."

09:56.600 --> 09:59.960
They used the money as the excuse for
a common robbery, but it wasn't casual.

10:00.040 --> 10:02.120
They came in
when the ambassador's daughter was there.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.000
"That's why that man
speaks without hesitation.

10:04.160 --> 10:06.640
He's in control, because he knows
everything goes according to plan.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.360
What plan is better than going out
with the eight millions of the safe vault?

10:13.920 --> 10:16.160
They're printing their own unmarked money.

10:20.920 --> 10:23.160
-It's here, right?
-Yes, wait.

10:23.240 --> 10:24.360
Be careful.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.360
-Why isn't it working?
-The finger isn't clean.

10:33.040 --> 10:34.840
Has it got delayed opening,
like the other one?

10:34.920 --> 10:35.800
No.

10:41.120 --> 10:42.640
-Okay.
-Come on.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.880
-You can't come in.
-I've got a phone call

11:10.960 --> 11:12.760
for inspector Murillo, Raquel Murillo.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.680
-Fine.
-It's urgent and private.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.880
-It's urgent.
-Go ahead.

11:22.520 --> 11:24.360
-Thanks.
-Stretch your arms.

11:33.320 --> 11:34.680
Come with me.

11:38.560 --> 11:41.920
-An incoming call in the repeater.
-Record it. Now.

11:43.480 --> 11:44.560
It's recording.

11:44.640 --> 11:46.960
"A civilian is going towards
the command post, he's with Almansa.

11:47.120 --> 11:49.680
He wants to see the inspector,
a private and urgent matter."

11:52.240 --> 11:55.680
Excuse me, inspector, but I've got
your mother on the phone.

11:56.240 --> 11:59.000
I guess you phoned her from my phone.
Excuse me.

11:59.600 --> 12:01.800
I think it has to do with your daughter.

12:15.960 --> 12:17.480
-Hello?
-"Darling."

12:17.640 --> 12:19.120
-Mum, what's up?
-Stop recording.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.040
-"Paula has left with her father."
-What?

12:21.120 --> 12:23.720
-"He told me it'd only be a while."
-Mum, what did you do?

12:23.800 --> 12:26.680
-"They haven't come back yet."
-Alberto has got a restraining order.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.760
He can only see Paula every 15 days
and he can't get in the house.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.800
-"I know, darling."
-Stop recording, jeez!

12:32.080 --> 12:33.920
-We can't.
-Then turn down the volume!

12:34.000 --> 12:34.920
"I couldn't..."

12:35.520 --> 12:36.640
Mum, mum.

12:36.720 --> 12:39.040
-How long ago did they leave?
-"Two hours, I think."

12:39.120 --> 12:40.880
Okay, wait for me there.

12:52.440 --> 12:57.400
-What a mess have you got here, huh?
-Almansa, take him out, please.

13:08.440 --> 13:12.440
The shots you heard were caused
by a situation with the police.

13:14.000 --> 13:17.600
It was caused by a hostage
who didn't follow my rules

13:18.240 --> 13:20.440
and tried to contact...

13:21.240 --> 13:22.680
using this phone.

13:39.880 --> 13:41.200
And I wonder...

13:42.600 --> 13:46.040
If I have Miss Gaztambide's phone...

13:47.720 --> 13:49.240
Whose is this one?

13:51.600 --> 13:53.560
Is this tune familiar to any of you?

13:59.080 --> 14:00.120
What has happened?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.080
What are you doing?

14:02.760 --> 14:04.120
We've all heard the shots.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.160
I've asked you what the hell has happened.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.040
Not here.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.320
We said no victims.

14:11.640 --> 14:14.040
She had a phone. What should
I have done, give her some lashes?

14:14.120 --> 14:17.080
Scare her, not kill her.
Cut her an ear, like in the movies.

14:17.160 --> 14:20.160
If she had given information to the police
about how many and where we are,

14:20.240 --> 14:22.240
now you'd be the one having been shot.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.640
But you'd keep your ear.

14:25.560 --> 14:26.560
Who shot?

14:28.040 --> 14:28.960
Denver.

14:30.880 --> 14:32.400
Too much hot blood.

14:33.200 --> 14:35.720
The Professor said
we wouldn't spill blood,

14:35.800 --> 14:38.320
-those were the rules.
-Well, there has just been a change

14:38.840 --> 14:40.640
concerning hostage control.

14:42.440 --> 14:43.360
Understood?

14:44.600 --> 14:48.320
Calm down, the public opinion is on
our side and that's not going to change.

14:48.400 --> 14:51.400
When they notice there's
a hostage missing, we won't be here.

14:52.080 --> 14:53.080
We'll be far away.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.920
Does the Professor know that? Huh?

14:55.600 --> 14:58.200
Does the Professor know you've broken
the first fucking rule of the plan?

14:58.360 --> 14:59.880
Are you telling me about the rules?

15:00.760 --> 15:04.880
You, who due to your affair
with this jerk almost killed an officer?

15:05.240 --> 15:07.280
We must call the Professor and tell him.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.640
Boy.

15:17.160 --> 15:18.440
Call him, Rio.

15:30.840 --> 15:31.920
He doesn't answer.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.800
You can't look out and control everything
24 hours a day.

15:42.880 --> 15:46.360
You must eat, sleep, go to the toilet.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.440
That's why I'm in charge here.

15:49.360 --> 15:51.760
We'll only get out of here
if we're professional.

15:51.960 --> 15:54.160
Can you tell me
what the heck is going on here?

15:54.640 --> 15:56.160
I could hear you from the outside.

15:57.480 --> 15:59.440
Berlin has ordered
the execution of a hostage.

16:06.360 --> 16:07.560
Who did it?

16:14.640 --> 16:15.720
Your son.

16:22.680 --> 16:26.560
"A thief is, by definition,
an inveterate optimist.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.000
They always think
everything will be all right,

16:31.280 --> 16:33.480
but the first who realised was Moscow.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.400
He was one of those men who are honest,

16:41.480 --> 16:45.440
who give confidence, take care of you
and tell bad jokes.

16:46.240 --> 16:47.640
I felt tenderness towards him."

16:51.400 --> 16:52.920
What are you listening to?

16:55.440 --> 16:56.320
Great music.

16:57.600 --> 16:59.720
Do you know how music was invented?

17:01.840 --> 17:03.960
-No.
-On a train.

17:05.320 --> 17:08.640
There was a father and his son,
whose name was Patxi.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.280
The boy was very worried
to know if the train

17:11.360 --> 17:14.360
would stop at their village or not.
Besides, the child was a real pest.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.840
And he kept on saying:
"Will it stop, dad?"

17:16.920 --> 17:20.160
And his father: "It will, Patxi."
"Will it stop, dad?" "It will, Patxi."

17:26.400 --> 17:30.280
And what about Denver and you?
Relatives and artistic duo in robberies?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.120
Yes, just like the Sacapuntas Duo,
but with burglaries.

17:37.080 --> 17:40.200
"That afternoon Moscow told me
how he had dragged his son

17:40.280 --> 17:42.080
to that crazy robbery."

17:42.800 --> 17:46.560
My son shouldn't be here.
But when the Professor

17:46.640 --> 17:49.840
told me about the plan,
I dragged him with me.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.280
Hey!

18:06.160 --> 18:07.040
There.

18:08.600 --> 18:09.920
Give me a hug, jeez.

18:13.240 --> 18:16.040
You really like the food in prison, right?

18:16.120 --> 18:20.000
-Don't touch me, they're gases.
-Gases, sure.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.520
And the saturated fats
they give us to eat there.

18:22.600 --> 18:24.200
-Right.
-Give me a cigarette, come on.

18:24.280 --> 18:25.960
I've got it ready. Here.

18:28.160 --> 18:30.120
How are you? How's your life?

18:30.200 --> 18:31.760
Fine. Here I am.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.400
-What's the matter?
-What do you mean?

18:40.800 --> 18:43.320
-I'm excited to see you, dad.
-Don't try to fool me.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.080
It's the sixth time you come to pick me up
and you've never looked that way.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.520
What the fuck is up?

18:52.200 --> 18:53.280
I've fucked it up.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.200
What the hell did you do?

18:57.600 --> 18:59.720
He had lost 800 pills.

19:00.120 --> 19:03.800
Of someone called Pole,
a shitty dealer from AlcorcÃ³n.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.280
It seems they had been stolen
from his car.

19:07.840 --> 19:08.840
And he's got a boss.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.440
That motherfucker is a lunatic.

19:12.680 --> 19:18.080
And they break your nasal septum,
they break you a leg...

19:19.000 --> 19:21.560
So everybody knows
you stole the drugs to the wrong man.

19:25.680 --> 19:30.240
Dad, the deadline is finishing
and I haven't got the dough.

19:30.400 --> 19:33.200
I swear to God I haven't got it,
they stole it from my car,

19:33.280 --> 19:36.600
I didn't sell it or anything. I didn't
take those pills, drugs make me ill.

19:44.440 --> 19:47.760
So, not to have his meniscus broken
by a baseball bat, you said:

19:48.880 --> 19:50.480
"Let's make him print notes."

19:50.560 --> 19:52.800
He's already done all the bad works:

19:54.280 --> 19:57.480
fur shops, savings banks, vans...

19:58.320 --> 20:01.400
And now... turn for a big one.

20:02.240 --> 20:05.120
If everything goes well,
I'm taking my son to a country

20:05.680 --> 20:08.000
whose name we can't even pronounce.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.320
Without Poles, without pending cases,
to start from scratch.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.880
But of course, with mojitos and beaches.

20:16.520 --> 20:18.520
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

20:18.680 --> 20:22.840
-Boy, don't you see I'm washing the floor?
-I left my notes to study.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.240
-You left your notes... Come on, beat it.
-Don't be a pest, let me do it.

20:28.040 --> 20:30.400
-Will you...?
-Dad, I have to study,

20:30.480 --> 20:33.840
-I left my notes. I'm coming.
-Beat it, come on. Come on.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.280
Come on, go away. Jeez.

20:41.760 --> 20:42.640
Moscow!

20:45.680 --> 20:46.720
Stop.

20:49.480 --> 20:52.520
For the last time,
go back to your position.

21:00.720 --> 21:01.960
What are you going to do?

21:02.800 --> 21:03.760
Shoot me?

21:05.800 --> 21:07.200
And then who?

21:07.960 --> 21:08.960
Everyone?

21:10.240 --> 21:12.160
Are you staying alone in this mouse trap?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.720
Son.

21:48.400 --> 21:49.880
Have you killed that woman?

22:02.080 --> 22:03.080
Dad.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.000
Nothing.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.560
-I can't breathe.
-Dad.

22:13.880 --> 22:16.120
Dad, what's up? What's up?

22:16.200 --> 22:17.880
Dad, is it a heart attack?

22:17.960 --> 22:21.120
Are you having a heart attack?
Dad, no, no.

22:21.200 --> 22:24.360
It's an anxiety attack.
Lie him down. Lie him down.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.960
-Dad, dad.
-That's it.

22:27.360 --> 22:31.160
"Lying on that floor full of blood,
Moscow knew there'd be no caipirinhas

22:31.880 --> 22:34.040
or any country they couldn't pronounce.

22:35.480 --> 22:38.240
He hadn't taken Denver there
to save him from something,

22:38.560 --> 22:41.480
but to sink him in a hole
from which he'd only get out arrested

22:42.040 --> 22:43.480
or with a bullet in his chest."

22:48.160 --> 22:49.880
Excuse me. Sorry.

22:51.200 --> 22:54.240
The shot we've heard before...
Is anyone hurt?

22:54.600 --> 22:56.200
Calm down, all right?

22:56.600 --> 22:58.640
Nobody was hurt. Okay?

22:59.080 --> 23:02.040
We only shot to dissuade
an intervention. Just that.

23:04.040 --> 23:06.920
You've heard that.
Stop thinking weird things

23:07.000 --> 23:10.360
about those shots, okay?
These people are robbers,

23:10.440 --> 23:13.000
not from the jihad or anything similar.

23:18.600 --> 23:21.320
-Mum.
-Honey, I'm sorry.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.360
It's a rollercoaster.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.640
Well, which is the other one,
where you get wet?

23:30.720 --> 23:33.040
-The spinning boats.
-Oh, yes, the boats.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.040
Your mother.

23:37.560 --> 23:42.080
Mummy! We've been
at the amusement park. It's so cool.

23:42.400 --> 23:43.480
Of course, honey.

23:44.880 --> 23:48.840
Mum, can you go upstairs
and leave the teddy bear in her room?

23:49.440 --> 23:50.400
Sure, honey.

23:52.800 --> 23:54.080
Come here, love.

24:03.720 --> 24:05.640
You've violated a restraining order.

24:06.520 --> 24:08.200
Turn around and stand against the wall.

24:08.360 --> 24:10.760
Raquel, I'm her father.
You can't keep me away from Paula.

24:10.880 --> 24:14.800
You've violated a restraining order.
Turn around and stand against the wall.

24:14.880 --> 24:16.760
You've already screwed up my life.
Isn't that enough?

24:16.840 --> 24:18.360
-I said stand...!
-What are you doing?

24:21.000 --> 24:21.880
Really?

24:22.800 --> 24:24.400
Are you pointing at me with your gun?

24:54.960 --> 24:55.840
Hello?

24:55.920 --> 24:58.920
"Raquel, it's Salva.
I'm calling you from the cafeteria.

24:59.000 --> 25:01.360
Look, this is urgent,
you took away my phone.

25:02.400 --> 25:03.320
Raquel?"

25:06.400 --> 25:08.400
Dad. Dad.

25:09.360 --> 25:10.440
How are you feeling?

25:11.320 --> 25:12.200
I'm cold.

25:12.560 --> 25:13.480
-Cold?
-Yes.

25:13.560 --> 25:14.640
-Bring a blanket.
-Yes.

25:14.880 --> 25:17.520
-And some sugar, whatever.
-Come on, Helsinki, go get some sugar.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.800
You're like a built-in wardrobe.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.560
Don't know what happened to me.

25:23.720 --> 25:27.040
It's because I spent the whole morning...
digging the tunnel.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.800
And I only ate
one of those shitty sandwiches.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.520
Now rest, dad. Rest.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.800
You know what would do you good now?

25:42.120 --> 25:44.120
A good stew, one of those you like.

25:44.200 --> 25:47.720
-With chickpeas and pork.
-Here. The blanket, come on.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.120
-Fine. Relax, Moscow.
-Thanks.

25:51.720 --> 25:55.960
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.440
Now relax, all right?

26:16.040 --> 26:18.440
What are you doing here, dad? God!

26:20.520 --> 26:23.040
I wake up at 4:00 A.M.
and you're not in bed.

26:23.440 --> 26:26.160
Nothing, jeez, I couldn't sleep

26:26.520 --> 26:28.920
and I went out to look at the sky.

26:29.680 --> 26:30.560
The sky...

26:32.800 --> 26:34.320
The sky is huge, right?

26:35.000 --> 26:36.320
Where must all that end?

26:40.200 --> 26:41.680
-What's up?
-Nothing.

26:43.960 --> 26:46.680
-Do you know why I left the mine?
-Of course I do.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.960
Due to that shit
that was eating your lungs.

26:49.080 --> 26:51.560
-The "syphilis."
-The "syphilis", right?

26:51.640 --> 26:53.280
-What's up?
-You're fucking brute.

26:53.360 --> 26:55.160
-Silicosis.
-That's what I said.

26:55.800 --> 26:56.840
But it wasn't that.

26:58.640 --> 27:00.560
I left it because
I suffered from claustrophobia.

27:00.960 --> 27:01.840
-You?
-Yes.

27:02.520 --> 27:05.920
I couldn't stand being in that hole.

27:10.240 --> 27:14.160
So I started with robberies
to make a living.

27:15.280 --> 27:18.480
And I ended up in prison.
Locked up, like my whole fucking life.

27:20.200 --> 27:22.560
Are you okay, dad? You sound strange.

27:23.840 --> 27:24.720
Not strange.

27:26.440 --> 27:29.880
I'm fucking great,
here, in the countryside,

27:30.640 --> 27:31.760
in the open air.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.280
I wasn't born to be over a barrel.

27:36.360 --> 27:38.080
-We're fucking great, dad.
-Yes.

27:38.160 --> 27:39.960
And it'd be greater
when we leave this place.

27:40.120 --> 27:41.000
You know one thing?

27:42.200 --> 27:44.320
Fuck the Maserati and they gyms.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.520
You know what we're going
to do with our millions?

27:47.960 --> 27:49.560
We're going to buy an island.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.320
So you can sleep in the raw
among the palm trees.

27:53.800 --> 27:56.360
In a hut. One hut for you, another for me.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.080
-Yes.
-No sleeping together like here,

27:58.160 --> 28:01.000
-because you snore too much.
-What are you saying? I don't snore, kid.

28:01.080 --> 28:03.760
Dad, you snore like crazy, believe me.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.360
-Do I snore?
-You snore a lot.

28:06.440 --> 28:09.200
-I don't snore.
-You sound like a trombone, dad.

28:10.160 --> 28:11.280
Put it in.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.400
One second, okay?

28:16.760 --> 28:17.440
There.

28:21.280 --> 28:22.520
Let him rest.

28:25.160 --> 28:26.600
Finish cleaning the toilet.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.000
And then swap your position with Helsinki
and watch the hostages.

28:58.440 --> 28:59.320
Hello.

29:00.680 --> 29:02.040
I'm sorry. I'm a mess.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.880
No, really, don't worry.
I don't think I have any calls.

29:04.960 --> 29:08.320
Let me see.
Look, not even a single WhatsApp. See?

29:08.640 --> 29:09.520
I don't...

29:12.720 --> 29:15.520
Excuse me,
it's not my business at all, but...

29:16.400 --> 29:17.800
is everything all right
with your daughter?

29:21.200 --> 29:24.400
I stole your phone,
I frisked you, I almost arrested you,

29:24.480 --> 29:26.360
but you're still worried about me?

29:27.480 --> 29:31.400
Well, you took the phone accidentally.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.960
It was due to the nerves.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.640
And the frisk was... Well, it was funny.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.680
What can I say? It was exciting.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.400
"The recorder. Where's the recorder?"

29:41.480 --> 29:43.800
-My arm was here...
-I'm sorry.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.840
-I'm sorry.
-Antonio was petrified.

29:45.920 --> 29:49.280
But at least my drinks were on the house.
So we're at peace now.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.400
-Everything's fine, thank you.
-Fine.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.480
-Fine.
-Good. I'm glad.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.520
In the end,
we worry a lot about many things

29:57.600 --> 30:00.040
and we shouldn't give so much importance
to things. In the end...

30:00.120 --> 30:01.160
Well, actually...

30:01.520 --> 30:02.600
nothing's fine.

30:04.440 --> 30:06.560
Everything... is quite bad.

30:07.160 --> 30:08.080
Awful.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.480
Fucking awful, I'd say.

30:12.880 --> 30:13.760
God...

30:14.080 --> 30:16.720
Excuse me, but... I...

30:17.480 --> 30:20.040
No, the emergency was...

30:21.480 --> 30:24.080
my ex-husband had taken my daughter and...

30:24.760 --> 30:27.440
Well, he's got a restraining order
for ill-treatment.

30:29.560 --> 30:30.440
Thanks.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.720
Thanks.

31:00.040 --> 31:01.840
I brought you some things to treat you.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.880
-Does it hurt a lot?
-A bit.

31:04.960 --> 31:07.040
Let's apply the tourniquet better, okay?

31:07.560 --> 31:09.280
-Okay.
-Let's see.

31:10.040 --> 31:10.960
Let's see.

31:15.520 --> 31:17.200
I think we should take out...

31:18.440 --> 31:20.040
-Yes.
-Okay.

31:21.920 --> 31:22.800
Shall I help you?

31:30.840 --> 31:31.720
Slowly.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.320
Come on, almost there.

31:37.800 --> 31:38.960
Okay, okay.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.320
Jeez!

31:47.960 --> 31:49.080
Okay, okay.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.200
Careful, careful.

31:55.520 --> 31:56.760
Okay, that's it.

31:59.680 --> 32:00.760
Oh, my God.

32:06.040 --> 32:06.920
Wait.

32:09.120 --> 32:11.240
I think we should take the bullet out.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.960
No, no.
No, there are muscles, bones and such.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.040
-You'll make a mess.
-I'll do it carefully.

32:18.200 --> 32:20.640
-How are you taking it out?
-I take it out and...

32:20.720 --> 32:23.520
-You can't take it out with that.
-It's better out than inside.

32:23.600 --> 32:26.120
No. Some people have bullets
and they're okay.

32:26.200 --> 32:29.240
I've seen it on TV.
And pieces of glass... It's all right.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.480
-Okay, okay.
-Leave it there.

32:31.680 --> 32:34.920
We'll cover the bleeding
and see how you progress, okay?

32:35.360 --> 32:36.240
-Yes.
-Calm down.

32:42.160 --> 32:43.040
Okay.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.720
Okay, okay.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.760
Okay, okay.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.000
Okay.

33:00.800 --> 33:01.840
Fine.

33:02.160 --> 33:07.040
Just like when we were kids
and played that Operation game...

33:13.160 --> 33:14.040
Okay.

34:11.800 --> 34:15.080
I brought loads of antibiotics.

34:15.760 --> 34:18.240
Painkillers, muscle relaxants...
Everything.

34:18.320 --> 34:19.280
Won't that be bad?

34:20.280 --> 34:22.400
I hope it doesn't have contraindications.

34:23.520 --> 34:26.920
Well, it can't have
more contraindications than a bullet.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.240
I was thinking of the baby.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.400
You're right.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.840
Okay, okay.

34:38.560 --> 34:41.920
I'll read the pamphlet
and see what we do, okay?

34:48.720 --> 34:49.600
Let me see.

34:49.760 --> 34:53.320
"Read this pamphlet carefully
before you start taking the medicine.

34:53.720 --> 34:56.800
Keep this pamphlet,
because you might need to read it again.

35:00.840 --> 35:03.120
If you have doubts,
ask your doctor or pharmacist.

35:03.200 --> 35:05.360
This medicine has been prescribed and...

35:50.840 --> 35:51.720
Okay.

36:21.880 --> 36:22.760
No.

36:30.720 --> 36:32.760
Hey. Have you got more noodles?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.480
Not noodles. I have some rice.

36:42.360 --> 36:43.400
It's all right.

36:50.880 --> 36:51.760
Moscow.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.880
Moscow, what are you doing? Hey!

37:01.080 --> 37:02.520
What the fuck are you doing?

37:04.040 --> 37:05.320
Tokyo, what's up?

37:05.400 --> 37:07.560
-I don't know.
-Don't open the doors!

37:07.640 --> 37:08.520
Moscow!

37:11.560 --> 37:14.120
-They're opening the doors.
-Get ready.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.760
-Come on, come on!
-In your places.

37:19.480 --> 37:20.520
Don't move!

37:21.400 --> 37:22.280
Snipers.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.480
-"Alpha 1 positioned.
-Alpha 2 positioned.

37:24.560 --> 37:26.040
Alpha 3 positioned."

37:27.400 --> 37:28.960
On the floor! Everyone!

37:29.040 --> 37:30.280
On the floor! Now!

37:32.600 --> 37:33.920
I have a shot.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.440
-In three, two, one.
-Dad!

37:35.560 --> 37:38.120
-Cover your face! Cover your face!
-Let me out.

37:38.280 --> 37:40.080
-They're not wearing masks.
-"They're wrestling."

37:40.160 --> 37:42.120
-No, dad.
-I have to get out.

37:42.280 --> 37:44.320
-Record it.
-"I can't see their faces."

37:44.480 --> 37:46.320
-I have to get out.
-Out? Why?

37:46.400 --> 37:47.920
"Sir, I have a shot."

37:49.120 --> 37:52.520
It's my fault. You shouldn't be here.
You shouldn't have killed anyone.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.920
-"Waiting for the order.
-Have I got the green light, sir?"

37:57.680 --> 37:59.520
-Let me out.
-You want to turn yourself in

37:59.600 --> 38:02.760
-so you can be the patsy.
-"We don't know if they're robbers.

38:02.920 --> 38:04.440
Have I got the green light, sir?"

38:05.680 --> 38:07.720
-Let me out.
-I didn't kill her.

38:09.400 --> 38:11.160
-Let me out.
-I didn't kill her.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.200
She's hidden.

38:17.320 --> 38:19.600
"The doors are closing, sir.
Three seconds.

38:19.680 --> 38:21.760
-Doors closed.
-Don't shoot."

38:25.680 --> 38:26.680
Jesus!

38:29.120 --> 38:31.320
-Let me out.
-We're getting out, dad.

38:31.480 --> 38:33.640
Outside, so you can breathe fresh air.

38:33.720 --> 38:35.240
-I need some air.
-Yes.

38:43.280 --> 38:45.160
I'm so sorry that you had gone through...

38:48.080 --> 38:51.080
Through an experience so...

38:52.240 --> 38:56.840
Well, if you need some kind of help,
I can give you...

38:57.760 --> 39:00.600
A phone always at your disposal,
a bodyguard with glasses...

39:03.000 --> 39:04.960
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have joked
about something like that.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.680
-I'm a jerk.
-No, don't worry.

39:06.760 --> 39:10.040
I apologise.
But I see you and... And it doesn't fit.

39:10.120 --> 39:13.360
It's not what I imagine
when I think about...

39:13.520 --> 39:16.720
About what? A battered woman?

39:19.960 --> 39:21.400
Because I've got a gun, right?

39:23.520 --> 39:24.520
Listen,

39:25.680 --> 39:29.360
the reality is that...
it doesn't start with a smack.

39:30.600 --> 39:34.040
In that case,
nobody would be with a violent man.

39:36.280 --> 39:37.640
It's the other way round.

39:38.840 --> 39:39.720
You're...

39:40.440 --> 39:44.120
You fall in love
with a charming and intelligent man...

39:45.040 --> 39:47.400
who makes you feel
the centre of the universe.

39:48.320 --> 39:52.240
And when he asks you
to change your profile picture

39:52.320 --> 39:55.320
and use a picture of your daughter,
you think it's tender.

39:56.920 --> 40:00.360
And when he tells you
not to wear a miniskirt to work,

40:00.840 --> 40:04.280
you think: "I'm a woman who works

40:04.360 --> 40:08.560
in a men's world,
he's actually protecting me."

40:11.120 --> 40:15.280
And then one day... he raises his voice...

40:15.880 --> 40:19.840
-You don't have to tell me.
-Yes, yes. I need it.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.120
Look, it's like...

40:23.200 --> 40:25.360
It's like going down steps
little by little.

40:25.480 --> 40:29.160
Like in those horror films
where somebody goes down to the basement

40:29.240 --> 40:33.240
and everybody thinks:
"Don't go downstairs. Don't do it."

40:34.720 --> 40:35.680
But you do it.

40:38.120 --> 40:39.560
That's where I got the first slap.

40:41.600 --> 40:43.960
And then the second, and the third...

40:46.120 --> 40:47.600
And finally I got the divorce.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.400
Didn't you report him?

40:55.600 --> 40:58.000
No. He was a police officer,

40:58.560 --> 41:03.800
the most popular guy in the station,
and I just wanted to lose sight of him.

41:06.280 --> 41:11.200
I guess... I was ashamed
to sit down in front of my boss

41:12.120 --> 41:15.760
and tell him about a year and a half
of humiliation and blows.

41:18.080 --> 41:20.520
I've got a 9mm HK in my holster,

41:20.600 --> 41:24.760
but... I really don't fucking know
how to take care of myself.

41:26.480 --> 41:27.440
Don't say that.

41:28.600 --> 41:33.480
But... the real drama
came some months later.

41:35.280 --> 41:38.000
Because my sister fell in love with him.

41:43.160 --> 41:46.720
They started going out, and travelling.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.640
And then I reported him,

41:51.080 --> 41:52.440
late and without evidence.

41:57.320 --> 41:59.960
Because I didn't want my sister
to get into that hell.

42:01.000 --> 42:01.920
Do you understand?

42:03.920 --> 42:07.960
But, sure, I only seemed to be
a pathological jealous woman

42:08.040 --> 42:09.600
making a fake complaint.

42:11.760 --> 42:14.040
"See? The inspector
didn't report him back then

42:14.560 --> 42:16.800
but she does now he's with her sister."

42:17.080 --> 42:21.160
But, Raquel, the police or the judges

42:21.240 --> 42:23.720
must believe you,
it's impossible not to believe you.

42:24.840 --> 42:26.920
Raquel, now I've felt
the emotion and the helplessness.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.400
There must be someone who can help you.

42:28.560 --> 42:30.840
-Someone. Who's going to help me?
-Me.

42:34.240 --> 42:37.800
Sorry, I don't know
how I could help you, but...

42:41.960 --> 42:42.840
Thanks.

42:46.640 --> 42:47.520
Raquel.

42:49.840 --> 42:51.120
-Raquel.
-Ãngel.

42:51.440 --> 42:52.880
There's movement in the building.

42:52.960 --> 42:55.640
They opened the door for a few seconds
and there was a brawl.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.640
-We think it was with a hostage.
-Let's go.

43:12.920 --> 43:15.680
Listen, I want you to know
this is not a threat,

43:16.280 --> 43:19.200
but a personal favour
I'm asking you, not as a robber.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.040
I want you to put on the masks, the hoods

43:22.440 --> 43:25.200
and to get out to the terraced roof
without any signals or silly things.

43:25.440 --> 43:27.280
Only for 10 minutes, okay?

43:27.560 --> 43:30.680
You go out, have some fresh air
and come back, all right?

43:33.200 --> 43:36.320
What do you want, to distract the police?

43:36.440 --> 43:37.840
The police is already distracted,

43:37.920 --> 43:40.480
so leave them alone
and don't ruffle any feathers.

43:41.360 --> 43:44.800
We're bait. They're using us as bait.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.800
-What's that?
-They're throwing us to the wolves

43:46.880 --> 43:48.600
and meanwhile
they'll escape using another door.

43:48.680 --> 43:50.680
We're getting out due to humanity,

43:52.160 --> 43:56.280
because one of our mates needs to breathe,
and I won't tell you again.

43:59.000 --> 44:00.000
Don't move.

44:04.000 --> 44:05.640
What fucking world are we living in?

44:06.480 --> 44:08.840
Nobody's willing to do anything
for anybody, right?

44:09.240 --> 44:13.520
One of us has an anxiety attack
and you only think that you're a bait.

44:14.560 --> 44:15.960
Nothing's gonna happen.

44:16.320 --> 44:19.200
Nothing's gonna happen,
because I'm going out with you.

44:19.840 --> 44:21.680
Why did he have an anxiety attack?

44:22.400 --> 44:24.480
Due to shots. It was the shots, right?

44:24.560 --> 44:27.920
It was the shots. Who did you kill?
Who did you kill?

44:29.680 --> 44:31.120
Open your mouth, Arturo.

44:33.920 --> 44:35.760
Open your fucking mouth, Arturo.

44:36.280 --> 44:37.560
Open your mouth.

44:39.080 --> 44:42.440
Now raise your left hand
if you're going to keep on fucking around.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.120
If you're going to keep your mouth shut,
raise your right hand.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.280
Fine.

44:53.120 --> 44:55.040
Denver, stop it, now.

44:55.760 --> 44:56.640
Stop it.

45:00.960 --> 45:03.040
Stop goofing around, please.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.080
-He wasn't a hostage.
-Why do you say that?

45:08.240 --> 45:10.080
Because, unless
they're Gandhi's disciples,

45:10.160 --> 45:11.760
they'd never let a hostage get so far

45:11.920 --> 45:15.320
without shooting him in the back.
One of them wanted to turn himself in.

45:19.600 --> 45:20.840
Now, dad.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.200
Breathe some air.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.080
You don't need to do this for me.

45:30.200 --> 45:31.920
I remember when mum left,

45:33.120 --> 45:34.680
you had trouble breathing,

45:35.560 --> 45:38.120
you went out to the balcony
to try to do it every night.

45:38.360 --> 45:40.760
So, it doesn't matter,
you're going out there,

45:40.840 --> 45:43.800
breathe some fresh air
and when you're calm, we'll get back.

45:43.880 --> 45:47.800
Everyone with the masks and the hoods on.
Arturito, close to me.

45:59.880 --> 46:02.680
Here Condor 3 calling the command centre.
Movement on the roof.

46:03.760 --> 46:06.640
SuÃ¡rez, the snipers must be ready.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.960
-"It's a big group."
-Everyone in position.

46:09.120 --> 46:11.480
"Maximum attention, we have visuals.
They're moving."

46:14.760 --> 46:16.600
-Dad, calm down.
-Okay.

46:16.760 --> 46:19.160
Look, it's a fucking great day.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.320
-Yes.
-It's very sunny, huh?

46:21.400 --> 46:23.040
Breathe and relax.

46:23.200 --> 46:25.600
"It's a big group.
They keep on walking on the roof.

46:25.680 --> 46:27.520
They're moving
towards the edge of the roof."

46:31.120 --> 46:32.960
-Hello?
-"What's going on?"

46:33.040 --> 46:35.920
-Why are they on the roof?
-Moscow went out to have some fresh air

46:36.000 --> 46:37.480
surrounded by hostages with fake guns.

46:37.920 --> 46:41.800
As you know well,
I'd never have allowed this crazy thing,

46:41.880 --> 46:44.720
but right now my mates are convincing me

46:44.800 --> 46:48.640
-it's a good idea.
-"I don't want any further improvisation."

46:49.320 --> 46:50.960
Keep me posted of everything.

46:51.040 --> 46:53.720
"They keep on walking.
They're getting to the edge."

46:53.800 --> 46:57.360
If you don't start having a cool head,
forget about the millions, Acapulco

46:57.440 --> 47:00.000
and the garden full of children,
because you'll screw all up.

47:01.400 --> 47:04.720
You only have to do one thing:
be professionals.

47:07.680 --> 47:09.560
Doesn't this seem professional to you?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.120
-Precious.
-No, not precious.

47:14.720 --> 47:17.680
A fucking note
better than the ones in the bank.

47:18.120 --> 47:22.160
They can't even trace it. A work of art.

47:23.800 --> 47:26.640
-And you know why?
-Enlighten me, Nairobi.

47:31.160 --> 47:33.800
Because it's been made with care.

47:35.920 --> 47:37.520
I'm a professional.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.680
But I don't know what to do

47:39.760 --> 47:42.440
when your father has the heebie-jeebies
in the middle of this mess.

47:43.080 --> 47:44.680
Are you a robber before a son?

47:45.760 --> 47:46.720
Huh, Berlin?

47:47.640 --> 47:49.080
Before a human being?

47:52.920 --> 47:55.240
For a shithead like you maybe yes,

47:56.160 --> 47:58.240
but... I don't know.

48:05.480 --> 48:07.640
-Didn't you kill that girl?
-No.

48:08.160 --> 48:09.600
-Tell me the fucking truth.
-I didn't!

48:12.480 --> 48:14.040
Berlin caught her with a phone,

48:14.680 --> 48:16.880
ordered me to kill her
and I had to shoot her,

48:16.960 --> 48:19.280
-I had no choice.
-You're talking about MÃ³nica.

48:19.800 --> 48:20.960
You're talking about MÃ³nica.

48:21.040 --> 48:23.040
-What are you doing?
-What did you do to MÃ³nica?

48:23.120 --> 48:24.160
Go back to your place.

48:24.240 --> 48:26.120
This is not a courtesy call, Professor.

48:26.200 --> 48:28.880
If you want me to be frank
and not hide information from you,

48:28.960 --> 48:30.080
you should do the same.

48:31.000 --> 48:33.320
Everybody has the right
to stretch their legs.

48:34.000 --> 48:37.560
"Don't you think it's solidary of me
to let the hostages go out to breathe?"

48:38.640 --> 48:41.520
I assure it's not my intention
torturing or scaring them.

48:42.320 --> 48:44.800
"I only want
to return them safe and sound"

48:45.600 --> 48:47.520
as soon as you give me what I requested.

48:50.680 --> 48:51.600
That's all.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.560
"I repeat, they're armed,
take cover in the operation.

48:54.720 --> 48:56.120
I request instructions."

48:56.320 --> 48:58.400
-What did you do?
-Go back to your place.

48:58.480 --> 49:00.040
-Tell me where MÃ³nica is.
-Go back.

49:00.640 --> 49:03.760
-"Something happens.
-I request instructions."

49:03.960 --> 49:07.120
You killed MÃ³nica, Jesus.
She was innocent.

49:07.280 --> 49:10.040
-Here Condor 1. Visual of the targets.
-"I request the green light."

49:10.200 --> 49:11.560
-On your knees.
-What?

49:11.720 --> 49:14.000
-She was pregnant.
-Fucking snipers.

49:14.080 --> 49:17.000
Let them think we're hostages.
Your hands on your head.

49:17.080 --> 49:19.480
Don't play with me, stand up.
I'm talking to you.

49:19.640 --> 49:22.000
-"Something happens.
-They're bending down."

49:22.160 --> 49:25.400
-They made them kneel to execute them.
-"I need a command."

49:25.560 --> 49:26.640
There are snipers.

49:26.720 --> 49:29.240
On your knees, there are snipers.

49:29.320 --> 49:30.800
Everybody down.

49:31.160 --> 49:32.520
Go back to your place.

49:33.120 --> 49:35.240
-"A lot of movement on the roof.
-Condor 3 here."

49:35.400 --> 49:37.400
One DalÃ­ is aiming
with his gun at another.

49:37.480 --> 49:40.880
-"I can see it clearly.
-I request instructions, sir."

49:41.240 --> 49:43.920
-I need authorization.
-"They're still on their knees, sir.

49:44.080 --> 49:45.880
-I'm waiting for instructions."
-Give me the green light.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.640
-They're running.
-I have a shot at the kidnapper.

49:48.800 --> 49:51.960
-What the fuck are you doing?
-There are snipers, jeez.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.800
-On your knees.
-"They're aiming."

49:53.960 --> 49:56.040
-Give me the green light.
-"They're going to execute them.

49:56.200 --> 49:58.080
-They're going to shoot.
-I request to open fire."

49:58.240 --> 49:59.920
Put down the gun!

50:00.360 --> 50:01.600
"They're going to kill them."

50:02.040 --> 50:03.040
Green light.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.240
Condor 3, open fire.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.360
-"Target's down, sir.
-Target's down.

50:21.800 --> 50:23.080
Target's down.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.200
We have visual."

50:24.280 --> 50:26.760
He's the manager of the factory,
Arturo RomÃ¡n.

50:27.240 --> 50:29.800
-Stop the fire.
-Condor 3, stop the fire.

50:29.880 --> 50:31.800
All units, stop the fire.

50:35.240 --> 50:36.640
We've shot a hostage.
