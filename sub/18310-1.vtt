You really
make that up?

01:17.524 --> 01:21.460
Are you really
going to shave your legs?

01:21.561 --> 01:24.496
<i>Certo.  All
the Italians do it.</i>

01:24.564 --> 01:28.000
Some country. The women
don't shave theirs.

01:28.068 --> 01:29.501
Eh, huh?

01:34.074 --> 01:35.507
Stop!

01:38.578 --> 01:44.016
It was somewhere right along here
that I lost all interest in life.

01:44.084 --> 01:46.518
Aha! It was
right here.

01:46.586 --> 01:50.022
This is where I saw
Dolores Reineke...

01:50.090 --> 01:52.024
and fat Marvin!

01:54.594 --> 01:56.528
Why, Dolores?

01:56.596 --> 01:58.029
Why?

01:59.099 --> 02:00.532
They're
married now.

02:01.601 --> 02:03.466
See what I
saved you from?

02:03.537 --> 02:07.473
If I hadn't told you, you never
would have followed them out here.

02:07.541 --> 02:11.341
You made me lose
all interest in life,

02:11.378 --> 02:12.936
and I'm grateful.

02:18.151 --> 02:22.986
My brother said he saw
you and Nancy, Moocher.

02:23.056 --> 02:24.489
When?

02:24.558 --> 02:25.991
Uh... last Friday.

02:26.059 --> 02:27.492
Well, it wasn't me.

02:27.561 --> 02:29.995
I'm not seeing
her anymore.

02:38.071 --> 02:40.505
I kind of
miss school.

02:40.574 --> 02:42.508
This will be
the first time

02:42.576 --> 02:45.511
no one will ask us
to write a theme

02:45.579 --> 02:47.513
- About how we spent our summer.
- Yeah.

02:50.484 --> 02:52.975
When you're 16,
they call it sweet 16.

02:53.086 --> 02:56.021
At 18, you can drink,
vote, and see dirty movies.

02:56.089 --> 02:59.718
What the hell do you get to do
when you're 19?

03:01.495 --> 03:03.292
You leave home.

03:03.363 --> 03:05.331
My dad said

03:05.432 --> 03:08.765
Jesus never went further
than 50 miles from his home.

03:08.835 --> 03:11.303
Look what
happened to him.

03:11.371 --> 03:12.804
Whoo!

03:17.544 --> 03:19.239
Hey, man,
this feels great!

03:19.312 --> 03:20.745
Ahh!
Come on in!

03:22.549 --> 03:24.449
Hey, come on in,
Dave.

03:24.551 --> 03:27.452
I read where
this Italian coach said

03:27.554 --> 03:30.455
it's no good to swim
right after a race.

03:30.557 --> 03:33.253
Who's swimming?

04:28.682 --> 04:31.651
He was as normal
as pumpkin pie,

04:31.718 --> 04:35.210
and now look at him.

04:35.322 --> 04:37.688
His poor parents.

04:39.693 --> 04:41.661
It's that cologne
he wears.

04:41.761 --> 04:43.991
It's called...

04:44.064 --> 04:46.032
Neapolitan
Sunset.

04:46.099 --> 04:49.034
Yeah? Well, the flies
seem to like it.

04:49.102 --> 04:50.535
There.

04:53.607 --> 04:55.541
This is it?

04:55.609 --> 04:58.544
Well, you know what
the doctor said.

04:58.612 --> 05:00.045
At your age...

05:00.113 --> 05:03.480
What the hell
do you mean "at my age"?

05:03.550 --> 05:05.484
Damn see-through coffee.

05:05.552 --> 05:07.986
He says you have
a bad heart.

05:08.054 --> 05:10.488
That's got nothing
to do with my age.

05:10.557 --> 05:12.491
Our son's
ruining my health, Evelyn.

05:12.559 --> 05:14.493
What's he going to do?

05:14.561 --> 05:18.497
He wanted a year off,
so I give him a year.

05:18.565 --> 05:20.499
It hasn't
been a year yet.

05:20.567 --> 05:25.004
But, Evelyn, look what's happened
to him. He's turned into an "Ity."

05:25.071 --> 05:28.507
"Ciao, Papa. Ciao, mama.
'Arrivederci. '"

05:28.575 --> 05:30.008
That's "Ity" talk.

05:30.076 --> 05:33.011
I used to think
it was funny at first.

05:33.079 --> 05:34.512
Not funny anymore.

05:34.581 --> 05:36.515
He was very sickly

05:36.583 --> 05:39.518
until he started riding
around on that bike.

05:39.586 --> 05:44.148
Well, now his body's fine,
but his mind is going.

05:44.257 --> 05:46.521
He used to be
a smart kid.

05:46.593 --> 05:49.824
I thought he'd
go to college.

05:49.896 --> 05:52.160
You didn't want him to.

05:52.232 --> 05:54.530
Why should he?
I never went.

05:54.601 --> 05:58.002
At 19, I worked
in the quarry ten hours a day.

05:58.071 --> 06:00.938
Most of the quarries
have closed.

06:01.007 --> 06:03.237
Let him find
another job.

06:03.309 --> 06:05.777
Jobs are not
that easy to find.

06:05.879 --> 06:08.109
Let him look at least.

06:08.181 --> 06:10.411
Let him come home
tired from looking.

06:10.483 --> 06:11.916
He's never tired.

06:11.985 --> 06:13.418
He's never
miserable.

06:13.486 --> 06:14.544
He's young.

06:14.621 --> 06:18.421
When I was young,
I was tired and miserable.

06:18.491 --> 06:21.927
I had
my own place at 17.

06:21.995 --> 06:25.362
He says Italian families
stay together.

06:25.432 --> 06:27.900
Evelyn,
we are not Italian.

06:28.001 --> 06:29.935
I know, I know.

06:30.003 --> 06:34.440
It's just that I come
from a big family myself,

06:34.507 --> 06:37.442
and it was
kind of nice.

06:37.510 --> 06:40.946
He thinks we should
have another child.

06:41.014 --> 06:41.946
What?

06:44.417 --> 06:45.907
<i>Buon giorno,
Papa.</i>

06:46.019 --> 06:48.453
I'm not Papa!
I'm your damn father!

06:48.521 --> 06:49.954
<i>Buon giorno,
Mama.</i>

06:50.023 --> 06:51.650
She's your damn mother.

06:51.758 --> 06:53.749
Did you win again?

06:53.860 --> 06:56.420
The victory,
she was easy,

06:56.529 --> 06:58.463
but the promoter
tells me

06:58.531 --> 07:01.967
that the Italians
will be here soon.

07:02.035 --> 07:05.402
<i>I will race
with the best... Italianos.</i>

07:05.472 --> 07:07.406
Like nightingales
they sing.

07:07.474 --> 07:09.408
Like eagles
they fly.

07:09.476 --> 07:12.912
Speaking of flies,
you brought some in.

07:12.979 --> 07:15.413
<i>Fly in Italian
is mosca.</i>

07:15.482 --> 07:16.915
In English
it's "pest."

07:16.983 --> 07:18.416
Speaking of pests...

07:18.485 --> 07:20.919
Isn't this
a lovely trophy?

07:20.987 --> 07:22.420
Oh, yeah.

07:22.489 --> 07:24.423
So what?

07:24.491 --> 07:28.427
I lived 50 years,
I never got a trophy.

07:28.495 --> 07:30.429
You never
got a trophy?

07:30.497 --> 07:31.930
Nope, never got one.

07:31.998 --> 07:33.431
I give you this,

07:33.500 --> 07:34.933
numero uno,
King Papa.

07:35.001 --> 07:36.434
Don't do that.

07:36.503 --> 07:38.664
I have to take
a shower.

07:48.448 --> 07:50.177
<i>[Figaro Playing]</i>

07:53.019 --> 07:55.453
There's that
"Ity" music again!

08:59.485 --> 09:00.918
You know what?

09:00.987 --> 09:02.352
No. What?

09:02.422 --> 09:03.855
I'm leaving home,
that's what.

09:03.923 --> 09:05.857
Where are you going?

09:05.925 --> 09:07.859
About
five blocks south.

09:07.927 --> 09:09.360
Oh.

09:09.429 --> 09:12.364
I found this nice
little place to rent.

09:12.432 --> 09:14.366
It's so cute
I could scream.

09:14.434 --> 09:18.871
My folks said I could have
some of their furniture.

09:18.938 --> 09:20.371
All right!

09:28.448 --> 09:32.384
Maybe you could
give me a hand... moving.

09:35.955 --> 09:37.388
Oh, sure.

09:37.457 --> 09:40.893
If I'm not too busy,
you know?

09:48.334 --> 09:49.858
How's the job?

09:49.969 --> 09:51.903
You know what?

09:51.971 --> 09:54.064
Frank said if I keep up
the good work,

09:54.173 --> 09:57.233
in time, I'll become
head cashier.

09:57.343 --> 09:58.537
That's great.

10:01.481 --> 10:04.416
Well,
I should go now.

10:04.484 --> 10:05.917
Nancy.

10:05.985 --> 10:07.418
Uh...

10:07.487 --> 10:10.923
I think
I'll walk you to work.

10:10.990 --> 10:13.925
I'm going out
that way anyways.

10:23.970 --> 10:27.770
It gets 30 miles
to the gallon.

10:27.874 --> 10:32.277
Of course, the mileage
you get may vary.

10:32.345 --> 10:34.279
It's a beaut, right?

10:35.348 --> 10:36.610
Right.

10:37.884 --> 10:40.512
Boy, you sure know how
to pick 'em.

10:40.586 --> 10:43.612
Frankly, this is
the best car on the lot.

10:43.690 --> 10:44.952
Quality product.

10:45.058 --> 10:46.423
<i>Buon giorno,
Papa!</i>

10:46.526 --> 10:47.424
<i>Come sta?</i>

10:54.367 --> 10:56.232
Friend of yours?

11:01.708 --> 11:04.939
Aren't you glad
we got fired from the A & P?

11:07.046 --> 11:10.413
I mean, right now,
we'd be working.

11:10.483 --> 11:12.917
We didn't
get fired, Mike.

11:13.019 --> 11:14.919
You got fired.
We quit.

11:15.021 --> 11:17.251
All for one
and one for all.

11:17.357 --> 11:19.291
You know, there
ain't many places

11:19.359 --> 11:23.420
that will hire
all four of us.

11:23.496 --> 11:28.433
- You know what I'd like to be?
- Smart.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.935
A cartoon
of some kind.

11:31.037 --> 11:32.937
Wouldn't that
be great?

11:33.039 --> 11:35.940
You know,
when they get hit on the head

11:36.042 --> 11:37.441
with a frying pan

11:37.510 --> 11:39.944
and their head looks like
the frying pan

11:40.046 --> 11:41.946
with the handle
and everything?

11:42.048 --> 11:43.948
Then they
go booooing!

11:44.050 --> 11:45.950
Their head comes
back to normal.

11:46.052 --> 11:47.952
Wouldn't that
be great?

11:50.056 --> 11:53.457
How did you get to be
so stupid, Cyril?

11:53.526 --> 11:57.963
I don't know.
Guess I have a dumb heredity.

11:58.064 --> 11:59.964
What's your
excuse, Michael?

12:10.343 --> 12:12.243
You hear from
your folks, Mooch?

12:12.345 --> 12:13.744
Yeah, my dad called.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.748
There's a lot
more jobs in Chicago.

12:16.816 --> 12:19.944
He hasn't gotten
anything yet, though.

12:21.888 --> 12:24.721
Wanted to know
if the house was sold.

12:24.791 --> 12:28.557
He could use the money
something fierce.

12:30.363 --> 12:32.388
You can come live with me
when it's sold.

12:32.465 --> 12:34.899
In Italy, everybody
lives together.

12:35.001 --> 12:37.902
Since you won
that Italian bike, man,

12:38.004 --> 12:39.904
you've been
acting weird.

12:40.006 --> 12:43.407
You're really getting
to think you're Italian.

12:43.476 --> 12:46.206
I wouldn't mind thinking
I was somebody myself.

12:51.017 --> 12:54.680
I think the door's stuck
on that icebox.

01:10:09.051 --> 01:10:12.282
I made all
that other stuff up.

01:10:12.355 --> 01:10:14.220
I was born in Bloomington.

01:10:14.290 --> 01:10:16.724
I went to
Bloomington high.

01:10:16.792 --> 01:10:20.228
I was treasurer
of the Latin Club...

01:10:20.296 --> 01:10:21.729
Stop kidding
around.

01:10:21.797 --> 01:10:23.731
I'm not
kidding around!

01:10:27.737 --> 01:10:28.829
See...

01:10:31.374 --> 01:10:34.468
I'm what you
call a cutter.

01:10:39.682 --> 01:10:41.115
Oh, and Napoli?

01:10:43.019 --> 01:10:44.953
And the
big family?

01:10:49.659 --> 01:10:53.117
Well, it was
a good act.

01:10:53.195 --> 01:10:54.787
You...

01:10:54.864 --> 01:10:57.094
You certainly
fooled me.

01:11:08.210 --> 01:11:10.644
You know
what you are?

01:11:10.713 --> 01:11:12.647
I got a clue.

01:11:12.715 --> 01:11:15.650
I'll tell you
what you are.

01:11:22.391 --> 01:11:24.484
Oh, God!

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.492
You...

01:11:51.253 --> 01:11:52.413
Dave.

01:11:54.690 --> 01:11:55.918
Yes, Dad?

01:12:03.199 --> 01:12:06.134
I cut the stone
for this building.

01:12:06.202 --> 01:12:08.136
You did?

01:12:08.204 --> 01:12:11.640
Yeah. I was one
fine stonecutter.

01:12:11.707 --> 01:12:14.938
Mike's dad,
Moocher's, Cyril's...

01:12:15.011 --> 01:12:16.638
all of us.

01:12:18.180 --> 01:12:20.080
Well, Cyril's dad...

01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:21.138
never mind.

01:12:25.721 --> 01:12:29.157
Thing of it was,
I loved it.

01:12:30.726 --> 01:12:35.322
I was young
and slim and strong.

01:12:35.398 --> 01:12:38.834
I was damn
proud of my work.

01:12:38.901 --> 01:12:41.335
And the buildings
went up.

01:12:44.740 --> 01:12:48.676
When they were finished,
the damnedest thing happened.

01:12:50.079 --> 01:12:51.512
It was like...

01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:55.016
the buildings
was too good for us.

01:12:55.084 --> 01:12:57.018
Nobody told us that.

01:12:58.254 --> 01:12:59.346
Just...

01:13:00.923 --> 01:13:03.357
Just felt uncomfortable,
that's all.

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:07.027
Even now, I...

01:13:07.096 --> 01:13:11.533
I'd like to be able
to stroll through the campus

01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:14.034
and look
at the limestone,

01:13:14.103 --> 01:13:17.539
but I just feel
out of place.

01:13:20.276 --> 01:13:23.712
You guys still go swimming
in the quarries?

01:13:23.779 --> 01:13:24.871
Sure.

01:13:25.948 --> 01:13:28.382
All you got to show

01:13:28.451 --> 01:13:31.386
for my 20 years of work

01:13:31.454 --> 01:13:34.389
is the holes
we left behind.

01:13:35.791 --> 01:13:37.725
I don't mind.

01:13:39.395 --> 01:13:41.488
I do.

01:13:41.564 --> 01:13:47.002
Cyril's dad says he took
that college exam.

01:13:47.069 --> 01:13:49.663
We both took it.

01:13:49.739 --> 01:13:52.674
How did
both of us do?

01:13:53.743 --> 01:13:55.677
Well,
I don't know.

01:13:57.113 --> 01:14:00.082
One of us
did O.K.

01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:02.310
But neither...

01:14:02.384 --> 01:14:03.316
of us...

01:14:03.385 --> 01:14:04.352
Hell, I...

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:08.220
don't want to go
to college, Dad!

01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:10.224
To hell with them!

01:14:10.292 --> 01:14:12.783
I'm proud
of being a cutter.

01:14:14.296 --> 01:14:16.230
You're not a cutter.

01:14:16.298 --> 01:14:17.731
I'm a cutter.

01:14:19.135 --> 01:14:21.035
What,
are you afraid?

01:14:22.304 --> 01:14:23.396
Yeah.

01:14:24.607 --> 01:14:26.040
A little bit.

01:14:28.744 --> 01:14:32.578
And then there's
the rest of the guys.

01:14:37.586 --> 01:14:40.851
Well, you
took the exam.

01:14:40.923 --> 01:14:43.357
Did all right,
didn't you?

01:14:45.928 --> 01:14:47.520
Yes.

01:14:47.596 --> 01:14:49.029
Well, that's...

01:14:50.099 --> 01:14:51.532
That's good.

01:14:53.435 --> 01:14:54.868
Well, your mom...

01:14:58.941 --> 01:15:02.377
Your mom will be
expecting us home.

01:15:09.118 --> 01:15:10.551
Come on.

01:15:22.298 --> 01:15:24.664
I'm supposed to
ride this thing?

01:15:24.733 --> 01:15:26.667
Well, that's
the official issue.

01:15:26.735 --> 01:15:28.669
You can't add or
change anything.

01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:32.833
Well, it's a
piece of junk!

01:15:32.908 --> 01:15:36.674
Hey, it's got a lot
of personality to it.

01:15:36.745 --> 01:15:39.680
It doesn't look
that bad to me.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:42.683
That's 'cause
you don't have to ride it.

01:15:44.753 --> 01:15:46.345
You don't have to ride.

01:15:46.422 --> 01:15:48.356
We're not going to beg you.

01:15:48.424 --> 01:15:50.756
We'll plead,
but never beg.

01:15:50.826 --> 01:15:52.851
The hell with it!

01:15:52.928 --> 01:15:54.361
Get off, Cyril.

01:15:54.430 --> 01:15:56.796
At least
we got invited.

01:15:59.268 --> 01:16:02.032
I'll just
take it back.

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:04.538
You seem
relieved, Mike.

01:16:04.607 --> 01:16:08.099
Don't you think
we can win anymore?

01:16:10.546 --> 01:16:12.878
Why not?

01:16:12.948 --> 01:16:16.406
<i>Maybe those guys
are better than us.</i>

01:16:18.787 --> 01:16:22.780
That's the first
time you ever said that!

01:16:22.858 --> 01:16:27.124
That's the first time
I ever felt that.

01:16:32.134 --> 01:16:33.567
All right.

01:18:18.707 --> 01:18:20.174
Hello.

01:18:23.812 --> 01:18:25.746
What are you
doing here?

01:18:27.816 --> 01:18:29.477
I'm leaving soon.

01:18:30.886 --> 01:18:32.683
Where are you going?

01:18:32.755 --> 01:18:34.882
I got a job
in Chicago.

01:18:34.957 --> 01:18:37.391
Moocher's dad got
a job in Chicago.

01:18:37.459 --> 01:18:38.323
He's, uh...

01:18:43.966 --> 01:18:49.063
I'm going to Italy
after all with my parents.

01:18:49.138 --> 01:18:50.901
Great, Kath.

01:18:50.973 --> 01:18:53.908
I wish you
a nice trip.

01:18:53.976 --> 01:18:55.500
You, too.

01:18:55.577 --> 01:18:57.511
I'm not going
anywhere.

01:18:59.815 --> 01:19:02.477
I don't know
about that.

01:19:10.059 --> 01:19:10.991
Thank you.

01:19:11.060 --> 01:19:12.152
You're welcome.

01:19:12.227 --> 01:19:16.163
If you eat so much,
how come you're small?

01:19:16.231 --> 01:19:17.664
Oh, it's my
metabolism.

01:19:17.733 --> 01:19:20.327
I eat three
times a day.

01:19:20.402 --> 01:19:23.337
My metabolism
eats five times a day.

01:19:24.406 --> 01:19:26.840
Well, I go back
to work tomorrow.

01:19:26.909 --> 01:19:28.843
You won't
watch us race?

01:19:28.911 --> 01:19:31.846
He thought he might
bring you bad luck.

01:19:31.914 --> 01:19:35.179
Well, I just have
work to do, that's all.

01:19:35.250 --> 01:19:39.778
Besides, there might be
another metabolism to feed here.

01:19:39.855 --> 01:19:41.914
We might be
a father?

01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:44.788
<i>No, I might be a father.
Your mom might be a mother.</i>

01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.124
You might be a brother.

01:19:47.196 --> 01:19:50.723
That way, I keep it
all in the family.

01:19:50.799 --> 01:19:53.859
I didn't think
people your age...

01:19:53.936 --> 01:19:57.633
The next word
may be your last.

01:19:57.706 --> 01:20:00.197
You must
be very happy.

01:20:00.275 --> 01:20:02.869
Do I have
any choice?

01:20:02.945 --> 01:20:06.813
You were going
to give a pep talk.

01:20:06.882 --> 01:20:08.816
They don't need pep.

01:20:08.884 --> 01:20:10.317
I need pep.

01:20:10.385 --> 01:20:13.320
Go on,
give it to them.

01:20:20.729 --> 01:20:22.162
Uh, we thought...

01:20:22.231 --> 01:20:24.165
As long as
you're out there,

01:20:24.233 --> 01:20:27.327
you might as well
tell them who you are.

01:20:27.402 --> 01:20:28.494
Right.

Gentlemen,
thank you very much.

01:22:03.031 --> 01:22:08.435
I want to point out three flags
you'll have to obey.

01:22:08.503 --> 01:22:12.940
First, the green flag
means the race is on.

01:22:13.008 --> 01:22:16.444
The green flag means
you are racing.

01:22:16.511 --> 01:22:20.311
The yellow flag means
there's been an accident

01:22:20.382 --> 01:22:26.287
or someone has a problem
that will slow down the track.

01:22:26.355 --> 01:22:28.289
Please follow
your leader.

01:22:28.357 --> 01:22:33.522
The third flag is
the checkered flag.

01:22:33.595 --> 01:22:35.825
This needs
no explanation.

01:22:49.144 --> 01:22:54.673
This is a 200-lap,
50-mile bicycle race.

01:22:56.485 --> 01:23:00.251
It will consist of 33
4-man teams.

01:23:00.322 --> 01:23:02.256
For the first year,

01:23:02.324 --> 01:23:07.387
an out-of-town team has
been invited to participate.

01:23:07.462 --> 01:23:11.762
I'm sure they'll give
their best effort.

01:23:11.833 --> 01:23:14.267
The Cutters,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:23:15.570 --> 01:23:21.270
Any team members may exchange
to another team member

01:23:21.343 --> 01:23:25.575
whenever they feel exhausted
or in need of help.

01:23:27.249 --> 01:23:28.477
Gentlemen...

01:23:30.319 --> 01:23:33.686

the Cutter team is doing.</i>

01:26:08.076 --> 01:26:10.010
<i>They started in
34th position</i>

01:26:10.078 --> 01:26:12.672
<i>and are moving up
through the field.</i>

01:26:12.747 --> 01:26:13.941
Oh...

01:26:15.417 --> 01:26:19.513
<i>The Acacia team just signaled
for an exchange.</i>

01:26:19.588 --> 01:26:22.887
<i>The single rider is
accelerating away,</i>

01:26:22.958 --> 01:26:26.359
<i>getting a lead
so the receiver</i>

01:26:26.428 --> 01:26:30.159
<i>will not be behind
when the pack comes by.</i>

01:26:30.232 --> 01:26:31.529
<i>Beautiful exchange!</i>

01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:34.034
<i>The other team is exchanging
right behind them.</i>

01:26:35.837 --> 01:26:37.270
<i>Sigma Tau Omega team.</i>

01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.975
<i>Another team is moving in
on the outside.</i>

01:26:42.043 --> 01:26:44.913
<i>It's team 34,
the Cutter team.</i>

01:26:45.046 --> 01:26:47.981
<i>He is fighting hard
to take the lead.</i>

01:26:48.049 --> 01:26:50.483
<i>He has taken the lead!</i>

01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:52.986
<i>Team 34 has succeeded</i>

01:26:53.054 --> 01:26:55.488
<i>in taking the lead
from the last position.</i>

01:26:55.557 --> 01:26:58.492
<i>What an incredible effort
by the leader of this race.</i>

01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.494
Come on!
You got him!

01:27:28.356 --> 01:27:29.789
<i>The Delta Chis</i>

01:27:29.858 --> 01:27:31.291
<i>and the Acacia team.</i>

01:27:31.359 --> 01:27:33.793
<i>The rider for
the Cutters team...</i>

01:27:33.862 --> 01:27:34.794
<i>Dave Stohler...</i>

01:27:34.863 --> 01:27:36.296
That's my boy!

01:27:36.364 --> 01:27:38.229
<i>is pulling
ahead even further...</i>

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.359
Pulling ahead!

01:27:40.435 --> 01:27:42.266
<i>It's incredible
what he's...</i>

01:27:42.337 --> 01:27:43.861
Come on, Dave!

01:27:43.939 --> 01:27:47.875
<i>He's turning in
some terrific
lap times here.</i>

01:27:47.943 --> 01:27:51.003
<i>I don't happen to have
a stopwatch, but...</i>

01:27:59.654 --> 01:28:01.019
He won't last.

01:28:02.991 --> 01:28:04.424
<i>It's utterly amazing.</i>

01:28:04.492 --> 01:28:08.861
<i>After 25 miles...
that's 100 laps, folks...</i>

01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:11.990
the rider for the Cutters
is still out front.

01:28:12.067 --> 01:28:15.400
<i>He has yet to
come in for an exchange.</i>

01:28:18.273 --> 01:28:19.968
We're
number one!

01:28:27.315 --> 01:28:30.011
<i>Someone's down.
There's an accident.</i>

01:28:30.085 --> 01:28:31.416
<i>I can't see who.</i>

01:28:31.486 --> 01:28:32.919
<i>Just a second.</i>

01:28:32.988 --> 01:28:36.424
<i>It's Dave Stohler
from the Cutter team.</i>

01:28:36.491 --> 01:28:39.358
<i>He had a 3/4-lap lead.</i>

01:28:39.427 --> 01:28:42.191
<i>I can't see
if he's hurt.</i>

01:28:42.263 --> 01:28:45.027
<i>He's getting back
on the bike,</i>

01:28:45.100 --> 01:28:47.534
<i>but he's obviously
in agony.</i>

01:28:48.937 --> 01:28:50.370
Come on, Dave!

01:28:50.438 --> 01:28:52.372
No way.
He wants off, man.

01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:53.873
That's the signal.

01:28:53.942 --> 01:28:55.466
He's coming in.

01:28:59.247 --> 01:29:00.612
Here you go.

01:29:00.682 --> 01:29:03.674
I don't want
to race.

01:29:09.357 --> 01:29:11.552
Get on the bike!

01:29:11.626 --> 01:29:14.561
It's ours now.
It's our race.

01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:16.119
We got it.

01:29:16.197 --> 01:29:17.926
Get going!

01:29:17.999 --> 01:29:19.432
No one is going.

01:29:19.501 --> 01:29:21.867
The other riders
are holding the bike.

01:29:21.936 --> 01:29:23.961
Get out there,
Mike!

01:29:24.039 --> 01:29:26.064
Get on the bike!

01:29:26.141 --> 01:29:27.608
The little
guy's riding!

01:29:32.380 --> 01:29:33.813
- You O.K.?
- What's the matter?

01:29:33.882 --> 01:29:34.814
What
happened?

01:29:39.421 --> 01:29:42.788
<i>As a result of that
terrible exchange,</i>

01:29:42.857 --> 01:29:46.088
<i>the Cutter team has
dropped from the lead.</i>

01:29:46.161 --> 01:29:48.857
<i>The Sigma Tau Omega team
has regained the lead.</i>

01:29:48.930 --> 01:29:53.094
<i>The Cutter team has fallen
into second position.</i>

01:29:55.003 --> 01:29:58.439
<i>Another team has passed
the Cutter team.</i>

01:29:58.506 --> 01:30:01.441
<i>The Cutters
are in third place</i>

01:30:01.509 --> 01:30:04.307
<i>and seem to be
losing ground.</i>

01:30:13.688 --> 01:30:15.121
Well, Ev, he tried.

01:30:15.190 --> 01:30:18.125
Even the announcer
said he tried.

01:30:47.822 --> 01:30:49.255
It's all over.

01:31:02.237 --> 01:31:03.534
Help!

01:31:17.919 --> 01:31:19.511
Nice try, kid.

01:31:19.587 --> 01:31:24.183
<i>The lead team has just
completed 170 laps.</i>

01:31:24.259 --> 01:31:26.284
<i>There are 30 laps
remaining.</i>

01:31:26.361 --> 01:31:28.795
<i>Sigma Tau Omega
looks unbeatable.</i>

01:31:28.863 --> 01:31:32.196
<i>Many things can happen,
as we've already seen.</i>

01:31:32.267 --> 01:31:35.202
<i>Things can change
like the wind.</i>

01:31:35.270 --> 01:31:37.738
Stay on
this side.

01:31:40.208 --> 01:31:41.641
Bring it in!

01:31:50.618 --> 01:31:53.178
Go, you Cutter, go!

01:32:05.166 --> 01:32:09.262
<i>The Cutters now have
a new man on the bike.</i>

01:32:09.337 --> 01:32:12.363
<i>He's doing a good job.</i>

01:32:12.440 --> 01:32:16.206
<i>He has moved the Cutters
into fourth position.</i>

01:32:16.277 --> 01:32:20.543
<i>He might make a serious
challenge for third position.</i>

01:32:20.615 --> 01:32:23.948
<i>We'll wait to see
if this happens.</i>

01:32:24.018 --> 01:32:26.919
We're not
doing too bad.

01:32:29.958 --> 01:32:32.449
<i>This once again points out</i>

01:32:32.527 --> 01:32:35.325
<i>the fact that this
is a team effort.</i>

01:32:35.396 --> 01:32:39.833
<i>One man may fall back,
another may be exceptional...</i>

01:32:58.386 --> 01:33:00.047
We showed them.

01:33:00.121 --> 01:33:01.554
Showed them what?

01:33:04.792 --> 01:33:07.886
Come on, Mike!
Bring it in!

01:33:07.962 --> 01:33:09.429
Come on!

01:33:22.210 --> 01:33:24.405
<i>Stohler is on the bike,</i>

01:33:24.479 --> 01:33:28.916
<i>his teammates are taping
his feet to the pedals.</i>

01:33:28.983 --> 01:33:33.420
<i>This means he won't be able
to exchange riders.</i>

01:33:33.488 --> 01:33:37.083
<i>He must ride
15 laps by himself.</i>

01:33:37.158 --> 01:33:38.523
Pick it up!

01:33:38.593 --> 01:33:40.527
Pick it up!

01:33:40.595 --> 01:33:42.028
Pick it up!

01:33:42.096 --> 01:33:44.530
He's back in
the race!

01:33:44.599 --> 01:33:49.036
<i>He has dropped from fourth
into sixth position.</i>

01:33:49.103 --> 01:33:51.128
<i>There are only
15 laps remaining.</i>

01:33:51.205 --> 01:33:54.538
Go, son!
Go, damn you!

01:34:31.145 --> 01:34:34.080
Stay behind him
till the third turn.

01:35:02.977 --> 01:35:05.411
<i>The Cutters,
team number 34,</i>

01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.913
<i>now in second place.</i>

01:35:06.981 --> 01:35:11.543
<i>They have completed
198 laps.</i>

01:35:11.619 --> 01:35:13.519
<i>198 laps!</i>

01:35:14.956 --> 01:35:18.892
<i>Still leading, Sigma Tau Omega,
team number 1.</i>

01:35:36.811 --> 01:35:40.178
<i>And here comes your leader
through turn number four.</i>

01:35:40.248 --> 01:35:43.684
<i>Coming down
to take the white flag!</i>

01:35:43.751 --> 01:35:45.685
<i>One lap to go!</i>

01:35:45.753 --> 01:35:50.019
<i>It's a duel between
Sigma Tau Omega and Cutters,</i>

01:35:50.091 --> 01:35:52.025
<i>teams number 1 and 34,</i>

01:35:52.093 --> 01:35:55.028
<i>as they battle out
through the last lap.</i>

01:35:57.098 --> 01:36:01.535
<i>Teams number 1 and 34
battling neck-and-neck</i>

01:36:01.602 --> 01:36:04.867
<i>as they come down
the short stretch.</i>

01:36:04.939 --> 01:36:07.203
<i>Half a lap to go.</i>

01:36:07.275 --> 01:36:10.039
<i>They're going into
turn number three.</i>

01:36:10.111 --> 01:36:12.045
<i>Number 1,
still leading.</i>

01:36:12.113 --> 01:36:15.378
<i>34 coming up very close
on the inside!</i>

01:36:15.450 --> 01:36:17.884
<i>They're going
for the checkered flag!</i>

01:36:17.952 --> 01:36:19.520
<i>And 34 wins!</i>

01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.418
<i>And 34 wins!</i>

01:37:23.184 --> 01:37:26.711
And now, this is what
you have been waiting for.

01:37:26.787 --> 01:37:28.379
The winning team,

01:37:28.456 --> 01:37:30.390
from Bloomington,
Indiana,

01:37:30.458 --> 01:37:33.393
the winner of
the Little 500...

01:37:33.461 --> 01:37:34.826
The Cutters!

01:38:17.705 --> 01:38:18.763
Bye.

01:38:29.617 --> 01:38:30.743
Pardon.

01:38:30.818 --> 01:38:33.252
Do you know where
is the Office of the Purser?

01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:38.156
You must mean
the Bursar's Office.

01:38:38.226 --> 01:38:39.284
Uh...

01:38:39.360 --> 01:38:40.987
<i>oui,  Bursar.</i>

01:38:42.964 --> 01:38:44.898
I was thinking
of taking French,

01:38:44.966 --> 01:38:46.399
but it's
my first year.

01:38:46.467 --> 01:38:49.664
<i>Have you seen
Le Tour de France?</i>

01:38:49.737 --> 01:38:50.669
No.

01:38:50.738 --> 01:38:52.672
<i>No? Mon dieu!</i>

01:38:52.740 --> 01:38:56.267
The French riders,
they're the best!

01:38:56.344 --> 01:38:57.777
Hiya, big shot!

01:38:57.845 --> 01:38:59.278
