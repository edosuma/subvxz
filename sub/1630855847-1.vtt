- [sobbing]

00:50.675 --> 00:53.219
- I'll get you back
to your mom.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.180
I promise.

00:55.221 --> 00:57.807
What's your name?
- Bella.

00:57.849 --> 01:01.019
- Okay. Okay, Bella.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.063
I'm Gabi.

01:03.104 --> 01:05.148
- Is this your house?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.608
- No.

- How long have you been here?

Hey.
- What do you want?

01:49.192 --> 01:50.485
- Can I use your phone?

01:50.527 --> 01:52.696
My cab driver thought

01:52.737 --> 01:55.448
that it would be cool
to get handsy.

01:55.490 --> 01:57.909
He was a complete ass
and...whatever.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.160
I-I jumped out of the car

01:59.202 --> 02:01.287
and he drove away
with everything.

I just--I just need to use
your phone.

is gonna go down.

02:22.642 --> 02:24.144
Make sure
you're paying attention

02:24.185 --> 02:25.520
'cause I'm only gonna
say this once.

02:25.562 --> 02:27.313
You will tell me
where Marqui Evans is.

02:27.355 --> 02:28.648
You will sit here quietly

02:28.690 --> 02:30.233
holding your pathetic
face together

02:30.275 --> 02:31.317
while I retrieve him and leave.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.944
And when the cops get here,

02:32.986 --> 02:35.030
you'll give them nothing short
of a full confession.

02:35.071 --> 02:38.158
Otherwise, the next 20 minutes
of your life,

02:38.199 --> 02:39.868
which is exactly how long
it's gonna take

02:39.909 --> 02:41.244
for said cops to get here,

02:41.286 --> 02:43.997
will have you prayin'
for death.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.999
- [spits]

02:46.041 --> 02:48.418
I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

02:48.460 --> 02:50.962
- I was hopin' you'd say that.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.130
He's all yours.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.381
- [grunts]

02:55.759 --> 03:01.056
- No, no, no, no!
[groaning]

03:01.097 --> 03:03.433
- They never learn.
- Just means more fun for us.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.185
- Gabi, Trent is gonna be mad.

03:05.226 --> 03:06.394
- He's just gonna have to be
mad, then.

03:06.436 --> 03:09.064
Zeke, talk to me.
Where am I goin'?

03:09.105 --> 03:10.940
- Straight across the room,
out the back door.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.192
- Left or right?

03:12.233 --> 03:13.485
- Left.
Far end of the courtyard.

03:13.526 --> 03:14.569
Heat signature is coming

03:14.611 --> 03:16.363
from the room in the corner.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.697
- How you holdin' up?

03:17.739 --> 03:19.407
I know this case
was triggering for you.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.201
- Gabi, I am all good.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.869
Next topic.
- Okay.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.038
How was your online date
with Shelby?

03:25.080 --> 03:26.373
- Shelly.
And on second thought,

03:26.414 --> 03:29.209
I'd rather talk about
being triggered.

03:29.250 --> 03:30.919
Door should be
right in front of you.

03:30.960 --> 03:34.089

03:48.019 --> 03:49.437
My name is Gabi.

03:49.479 --> 03:51.523
Your parents sent me
to find you.

You're safe.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.423
You wanna come with me?

04:16.464 --> 04:18.091
Get you a blanket,
maybe some juice?

04:18.133 --> 04:25.348
* *

04:26.891 --> 04:29.310
- Nice outfit.
- The occasion called for it.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.107
- Do I even want to know
how many laws you just broke?

04:34.149 --> 04:35.525
- Nope.
- What part of you

04:35.567 --> 04:36.818
and your team standing down
wasn't clear?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.695
- First of all,
Detective Trent...

04:38.737 --> 04:40.655
- Oh, it's Detective, now?

04:40.697 --> 04:42.449
- You guys would have never
received this tip

04:42.490 --> 04:43.783
if it wasn't
for me and my team.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.577
- Yeah, remind me,
we need to talk

04:45.618 --> 04:47.704
about how yet again,
you figured out this location

04:47.746 --> 04:50.665
before us cops.
- Just say thank you.

04:50.707 --> 04:53.293
- [sighs]
We'll take it from here.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.211
- Yeah, no.
You know the drill.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.796
I was hired by Marqui's family.

04:56.838 --> 04:58.298
I arrived on the scene first.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.674
One of my team stays with him

04:59.716 --> 05:01.134
until he's reunited
with his parents.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.095
Non-negotiable.
- Lacey is just an intern.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.263
- Are you kidding me right now?

05:05.305 --> 05:08.641
- Lacey I'd trust with my life.

05:08.683 --> 05:10.769
- I'm goin' with him
to the hospital.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.854
- [sighs]

05:14.522 --> 05:16.816
Escort Ms. Mosely
and Ms. Quinn to the hospital.

05:16.858 --> 05:18.485
They will be seeing to Marqui.

05:19.944 --> 05:23.073
- Dhan has your kidnapper
pinned up inside.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.033
- He needs to be breathing
for us to prosecute.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.493
- Then let's hope he is.

05:26.534 --> 05:27.911
- You are such a pain
in my ass.

05:27.952 --> 05:30.914
- And you wouldn't have it
any other way.

05:30.955 --> 05:32.791
[siren wailing]

05:35.877 --> 05:37.837
- Yeah, you can look at me.

05:37.879 --> 05:43.760
* *

05:43.802 --> 05:45.053
- [sobs]

05:45.095 --> 05:47.430
Thank you so much.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.015
- It's my pleasure.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.266
- Marqui's this way.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.686
- * Oh, oh, oh *

05:52.727 --> 05:55.355
* That's something beautiful *

05:55.397 --> 05:58.316
* Oh, oh, oh *

05:58.358 --> 06:01.361
* That you are here *

06:01.403 --> 06:04.531
* Here with me *

06:04.572 --> 06:05.532
[camera shutter snaps]
- And there was

06:05.573 --> 06:06.991
no one big lead,

06:07.033 --> 06:08.827
just hours of dedicated
police analysis...

06:08.868 --> 06:10.412
- Of course, Captain Mallory
is out here

06:10.453 --> 06:11.705
taking credit for our work.

06:11.746 --> 06:13.707
- Marqui is safe.
That's all that matters.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.291
- Gabi!
- Uh, Ms. Mosely!

06:15.333 --> 06:16.710
- Gabi, how closely
did you work

06:16.751 --> 06:18.253
with the DCPD on this case?

06:18.294 --> 06:20.213
Were you part of the rescue
operation tonight?

06:20.255 --> 06:22.382
- My team and I
were the rescue operation.

06:22.424 --> 06:24.926
- While I'm sure
Ms. Mosely and her team

06:24.968 --> 06:26.928
have been invaluable
to the Evans family,

06:26.970 --> 06:29.889
they are not cops.
- You're right. We're not.

06:29.931 --> 06:32.058
We're a crisis management firm.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.561
We're PR specialists,
we're lawyers,

06:34.602 --> 06:36.771
tech experts,
private investigators,

06:36.813 --> 06:40.108
all doing the job
the police seem too busy to do.

06:40.150 --> 06:41.443
- And what do you say
to the people

06:41.484 --> 06:42.736
who call you vigilantes?

06:42.777 --> 06:44.362
- We find missing people

06:44.404 --> 06:46.072
who have slipped
through the cracks.

06:46.114 --> 06:48.658
And we bring them home.
- While we appreciate

06:48.700 --> 06:51.077
Ms. Mosely's passion--
- Passion?

06:51.119 --> 06:54.080
You're talking to a woman
who 20 years ago

06:54.122 --> 06:56.541
had to rescue herself
from her kidnapper

06:56.583 --> 06:57.792
because no one was looking.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.754
[suspenseful music]

07:00.795 --> 07:03.298
Who is this?
- Sarah Holden.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.758
Senator Holden's
missing daughter.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.677
- Sarah went missing
29 hours ago

07:07.719 --> 07:09.929
while playing in the park
with her brother.

07:09.971 --> 07:12.307
There isn't a person in America

07:12.349 --> 07:15.643
who hasn't seen Sarah's face
all over their TVs,

07:15.685 --> 07:18.646
highly increasing her chances
of being found.

07:19.564 --> 07:21.107
Now, who is this?

07:21.149 --> 07:28.156
* *

07:31.993 --> 07:34.329
This is why
there will always be

07:34.371 --> 07:35.955
a need for what I do.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.750
Dasheka has been missing
from the D.C. area

07:38.792 --> 07:40.001
for the last two weeks,

07:40.043 --> 07:42.837
and no one is talking
about her.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.926
I sincerely hope we find Sarah.
I do.

07:47.967 --> 07:50.011
But while you keep prioritizing

07:50.053 --> 07:52.931
the missing high-profile
blonde girls of the world,

07:52.972 --> 07:56.142
my team and I will gladly
continue to pick up the slack

07:56.184 --> 07:57.602
for the rest.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.648
[singer vocalizing]

08:05.694 --> 08:07.320
- Uh, excuse me,
you that chick.

08:07.362 --> 08:09.197
Gabi Mosely, right?
You're always on the news?

08:09.239 --> 08:12.033
- Woman, lady, queen,
sometimes sis.

08:12.075 --> 08:14.327
Never chick. Understand?
- Yes, ma'am.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.871
Do you really take free

08:16.913 --> 08:19.332
pro bo-whatever cases
and find missing people?

08:19.374 --> 08:22.627
- Someone missing?
- My foster sister Camilla.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.838
She been gone over a day and...

08:25.880 --> 08:27.799
She's only 14.
My foster parents think

08:27.841 --> 08:30.218
she's just taking time
"to cool off."

08:30.260 --> 08:31.553
- Cool off from what?

08:31.594 --> 08:32.846
- [sighs]
They fight her all the time

08:32.887 --> 08:34.180
about her new boyfriend,
but, on God,

08:34.222 --> 08:36.683
I swear this time
it's something different.

08:36.725 --> 08:38.810
She'd never leave me behind.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.689
You don't believe me, do you?

08:42.731 --> 08:49.988
* *

08:56.411 --> 08:58.038
- Okay, based
on my initial search,

08:58.079 --> 09:00.540
Camilla is definitely
a wild child.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.375
Six foster homes
in as many years,

09:02.417 --> 09:04.753
and at some point,
she ran away from each one.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.963
Social media accounts
are private.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.841
But shouldn't take me too long
to hack through those.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.426
- Uh, can we not
say that out loud in case

09:11.468 --> 09:13.928
we need to protect Gabi's
plausible deniability later?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.930
- Someone has Plausible
Legality class this semester.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.808
- Lacey, tell me why Margaret
is offering him food.

09:18.850 --> 09:20.643
- Foster kid.
If he wolfs down the food

09:20.685 --> 09:22.562
like he hasn't eaten
in a long time,

09:22.604 --> 09:23.897
likely means trouble
at foster home.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.190
- I'm just gonna say it
'cause I can't be

09:25.231 --> 09:26.566
the only one thinking it.

09:26.608 --> 09:27.650
You said yourself
he's not giving you

09:27.692 --> 09:28.693
much to go on.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.278
It's been over a year

09:30.320 --> 09:31.488
of nonstop cases.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.822
You're going to burn out.

09:32.864 --> 09:34.240
- I know that
I'm the new kid here,

09:34.282 --> 09:35.742
but aren't we supposed to be
the ones looking

09:35.784 --> 09:37.035
when no one else does?

09:37.077 --> 09:38.536
- Sometimes people
aren't looking

09:38.578 --> 09:39.704
'cause there's nothing
to look for.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.705
- I imagine people said that

09:40.747 --> 09:42.374
when I went missing too.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.669
- So the kid's not lying.
Strong eye-contact,

09:45.710 --> 09:47.462
no verbal/nonverbal mismatches,

09:47.504 --> 09:48.755
proper response delays.

09:48.797 --> 09:51.508
He believes what he believes.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.426
- No tip is insignificant.

09:53.468 --> 09:55.929
Please, we just want
our daughter back.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.806
[reporters clamoring]
Excuse me.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.766
- If Camilla
really is missing,

09:59.808 --> 10:00.892
she deserves that.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.560
She deserves the whole country

10:02.602 --> 10:04.104
praying for her return.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.063
Camilla is worth

10:05.105 --> 10:07.691
at least a preliminary inquiry.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.442
Let's move.
Dhan, get over to Zeke's.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.903
You two gather information.
Everyone has a footprint.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.363
Find hers. Build a profile.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.906
Ladies, with me.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.493
- We understand
why Deron is worried,

10:18.535 --> 10:20.954
but Camilla's not
a missing person.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.872
She does this all the time.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.791
- She gets upset
about anything--

10:24.833 --> 10:26.292
this time, it's a boyfriend.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.795
She takes off
and is usually back in a day,

10:28.837 --> 10:30.171
profusely apologetic.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.048
- You don't worry
while she's gone?

10:32.090 --> 10:34.300
- Well, of course we do,
but we let it play out

10:34.342 --> 10:36.344
because this
is an established pattern

10:36.386 --> 10:38.096
of behavior for her.

10:39.556 --> 10:41.558
- She's untrusting and angry.

10:41.599 --> 10:43.143
We don't blame her.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.395
She's had a rough go of it
in the system,

10:45.437 --> 10:48.648
bouncing from home to home.

10:48.690 --> 10:50.233
- Until now, right?

10:50.275 --> 10:53.278
She's been with your family
for six months?

10:53.319 --> 10:55.864
- Yes, and we just keep
showering her with love

10:55.905 --> 10:57.615
despite her resistance.

10:57.657 --> 11:02.120
* *

11:02.162 --> 11:04.372
- Well, thank you
for indulging us.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.665
Hopefully we didn't waste...
- [exhales]

11:05.707 --> 11:07.334
- Too much of your time.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.337
May I use your restroom?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.880
- Yeah.

11:13.048 --> 11:14.341
- Something isn't adding up.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.842
The first thing you learn in PR
is spin.

11:15.884 --> 11:17.260
The Chapmans are hiding
something.

11:17.302 --> 11:18.470
Margaret?
- [gasps]

11:18.511 --> 11:19.846
You did your super focus thing?

11:19.888 --> 11:21.348
- You say that like
it's a superpower.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.932
- Well, it kind of is.
- No, anybody can train

11:22.974 --> 11:24.893
their brain to pay close
attention to detail.

11:24.934 --> 11:26.102
- And when are we taking
this little party trick

11:26.144 --> 11:27.937
to Vegas?
- Margaret, house. Go.

11:27.979 --> 11:30.315
- Okay, that house
is a mini prison.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.067
Every door to every room
in that house

11:32.108 --> 11:33.985
has a mini deadbolt lock
on the outside.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.029
- To forcibly keep people in,
not out.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.697
- Exactly. And all the pictures
on the mantle--

11:37.739 --> 11:38.865
the Chapmans with
their foster kids--

11:38.907 --> 11:40.033
Camilla's body language

11:40.075 --> 11:41.701
was always in protection
of Deron.

11:41.743 --> 11:42.952
- The kid was right.

11:42.994 --> 11:44.537
She would have never
left him behind.

11:44.579 --> 11:46.081
- Which means Deron just
officially became our client.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.208
Time to trigger
that AMBER Alert.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.085
- 911, what is your emergency?

11:50.126 --> 11:52.754
- I need to report
a missing person.

11:56.883 --> 11:57.092
.

11:57.133 --> 11:58.259
- It's about a high-profile
missing person.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.262
That's all I can tell you.

12:01.304 --> 12:02.639
4:00 p.m. That's right.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.599
Trust me,
this is a press conference

12:04.641 --> 12:05.767
you don't want to miss.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.394
[suspenseful music]

12:07.435 --> 12:08.937
- They're gonna think
this press conference

12:08.978 --> 12:10.355
is about the senator's
missing daughter.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.774
- I didn't say that.
Did you hear me say that?

12:12.816 --> 12:14.776
- The number one trending
hashtag right now

12:14.818 --> 12:16.152
is #FindSarahHolden.

12:16.194 --> 12:18.071
That's about as high-profile
as it gets.

12:18.113 --> 12:21.282
- Rule 101, whatever gets
the media to show up.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.784
- Other than
the foster parents,

12:22.826 --> 12:24.494
where are we on suspects?

12:24.536 --> 12:26.788
- The Chapmans were the last
to see Camilla alive.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.581
That was almost 48 hours ago.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.250
I just got
into her social media...

12:30.291 --> 12:31.626
- Basically,
the timing coincides

12:31.668 --> 12:32.919
with her last post.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.005
She's been a ghost since then.

12:35.046 --> 12:36.297
- I was getting to that.

12:36.339 --> 12:37.465
- Show me her last post?

12:37.507 --> 12:38.842
[monitor trills]

12:39.676 --> 12:41.177
Mm.
- As for the new boyfriend

12:41.219 --> 12:43.638
Deron mentioned...
- That could be anyone.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.140
- Whoever he is,
he's not a teen.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.766
- Try 20.
Least that's what he said

12:46.808 --> 12:47.809
when he slid in her DMs.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.978
He goes by just Eric.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.772
- Who wants to bet this perv's
done this before?

12:52.814 --> 12:54.524
- Sorry, can you not?
What are you--

12:54.566 --> 12:56.526
Yeah, okay. Good. Great.

12:56.568 --> 12:58.319
Got it.
- I'm also taking bets

12:58.361 --> 13:00.447
on how long
till they kill each other.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.781
- Okay, it never ends well,

13:01.823 --> 13:03.700
yet you keep forcing them
to work together.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.201
- They're good for each other.
Trust.

13:05.243 --> 13:07.620
- A blue-blood,
overly-sensitive agoraphobe

13:07.662 --> 13:09.539
and an emotionally distant
GI Joe.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.833
Yeah. Okay.

13:11.875 --> 13:13.501
- Rosario Mendez.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.046
Found her lurking
in Camilla's DMs too.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.173
Recent parolee.
Served time in Philly

13:18.214 --> 13:21.343
for possession and...
- She's Camilla's birth mother.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.261
Familial facial traits.
- She's been trying to get

13:23.303 --> 13:25.096
in contact with her
since she got out.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.431
- Zeke, I need
the last name and location...

13:26.473 --> 13:27.849
- Excuse me.
- Of the boyfriend.

13:27.891 --> 13:29.392
Dhan, track down
the birth mother.

13:29.434 --> 13:30.852
Lacey, Department of Children
and Family services.

13:30.894 --> 13:31.936
I need everything

13:31.978 --> 13:32.979
on Camilla's foster history.

13:33.021 --> 13:34.105
- I've got DCPD covered.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.398
See if I can't light a fire

13:35.440 --> 13:37.317
under this
missing persons report.

13:37.359 --> 13:38.526
- And as for me...

13:38.568 --> 13:39.944
[indistinct chatter]

13:39.986 --> 13:41.529
She was last seen

13:41.571 --> 13:43.365
in the hoodie in this photo.

13:43.406 --> 13:46.826
Remember, the first 48 hours
are critical.

13:46.868 --> 13:48.536
We need your help.

13:48.578 --> 13:50.205
Camilla Serrano,

13:50.246 --> 13:51.790
a 14-year-old girl...
[camera shutter snaps]

13:51.831 --> 13:53.458
Who should be thinking
of nothing more

13:53.500 --> 13:57.045
than softball practice
and hanging out at the mall,

13:57.087 --> 13:58.963
she needs your help.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.216
[soft dramatic music]

14:01.257 --> 14:03.385
Okay, it's your turn, sweetie.

14:06.680 --> 14:08.890
[camera shutters snapping]

14:08.932 --> 14:12.394
* *

14:12.435 --> 14:15.355
- I--I...I just...

14:15.397 --> 14:16.606
Uh...

14:16.648 --> 14:20.110
[voice shaking]
I need my sister.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.444
Please.

14:23.947 --> 14:25.740
I just want Camilla back.

14:25.782 --> 14:28.284
[indistinct chatter]

14:28.326 --> 14:30.370
- Any update from the police?

14:30.412 --> 14:32.580
Have they officially opened
an investigation?

14:32.622 --> 14:35.667
- A missing persons report
was filed earlier today,

14:35.709 --> 14:38.420
and I'm sure the police
are working overtime

14:38.461 --> 14:42.048
to find Camilla,
as they would any other child.

14:42.090 --> 14:45.635
Although, I have yet to see
an AMBER Alert.

14:45.677 --> 14:48.388
- [laughs]
Damn. Shots fired.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.598
- That chick--
like we're not busy enough

14:50.640 --> 14:53.101
without tracking down runaways
that don't want to be found.

14:53.143 --> 14:54.978
- Of course, you would assume
she's a runaway.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.605
- At the end of the day,
you, America,

14:57.647 --> 15:01.026
are Camilla's best chance
of making it home.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.946
Study that face,
those eyes, that outfit.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.948
Help us bring Camilla home.

15:06.990 --> 15:09.451
- You're up, Trent.
Get up to speed fast.

15:09.492 --> 15:12.245
Keep that Gabi woman in check
and out of my hair.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.164
- Can't make any promises.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.168
[notifications chiming]

15:20.545 --> 15:22.130
- Press conference worked.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.966
#CamillaMattersToo
is already trending.

15:25.008 --> 15:26.509
- Camilla's birth mother
missed her parole check-in

15:26.551 --> 15:28.219
this week in Philly.

15:30.138 --> 15:31.931
- Why are you here?

15:31.973 --> 15:33.099
All these months
of working together,

15:33.141 --> 15:34.684
you've never once
come here alone.

15:34.726 --> 15:36.519
- It's where Gabi wants me.

15:37.687 --> 15:40.148
- Is that what your trifling
rudeness is about?

15:40.190 --> 15:42.359
[chuckles] It bothers you
that Gabi brought me

15:42.400 --> 15:44.152
into the family?
- Using your family's money

15:44.194 --> 15:46.321
to bankroll this firm
doesn't make you family.

15:46.363 --> 15:49.240
[phone ringing]
It makes you useful.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.659
- Camilla asked to meet
with her DCFS social worker

15:51.701 --> 15:52.744
the morning she went missing.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.828
She never showed.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.330
But I'll give you two guesses

15:55.372 --> 15:57.624
of who was at DCFS all week
making threats.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.501
- The birth mother.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.295
- Here I was thinking
I was dropping something new.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.923
- Wait, Camilla's birth mom
took her?

16:04.964 --> 16:06.925
- Right now,
we're lookin' at everyone.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.427
That includes
your foster parents.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.513
- I don't--I don't think
they hurt her.

16:11.554 --> 16:14.265
- What about the locks
on the bedroom doors?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.850
Did they ever try
to lock you in?

16:15.892 --> 16:17.769
- Not me.

16:17.811 --> 16:19.562
- What about Camilla?

16:19.604 --> 16:26.194
* *

16:26.236 --> 16:29.989
- Well, sometimes
they'd lock her in her room

16:30.031 --> 16:33.493
to stop her from running away.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.287
- Where's my AMBER Alert?

16:36.329 --> 16:38.331
- I reclassified her
as a suspected kidnapping,

16:38.373 --> 16:39.791
so it's coming.
I'm on my way

16:39.833 --> 16:40.959
to interrogate the Chapmans.

16:41.001 --> 16:43.044
Anything else I should know?

16:46.339 --> 16:49.884
You planted a hidden camera
in their house?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.928
- 'Course I did.
- Privacy and legality

16:51.970 --> 16:53.346
mean nothing to you.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.265
- Don't act like you know me.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.854
That was just a mutual
scratchin' of an itch one time

17:00.895 --> 17:02.605
way before we worked together.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.315
- Well, I mean, technically,

17:04.357 --> 17:06.234
we still don't work together.

17:06.276 --> 17:08.361
- I just want to find Camilla
the fastest way possible.

17:08.403 --> 17:09.988
Keep watchin'.
Let me know if you discover

17:10.030 --> 17:11.281
anything interesting.

17:11.322 --> 17:14.367
- Thanks.
But I'll do this my way.

17:16.619 --> 17:18.038
The kid, Deron,

17:18.079 --> 17:19.247
you're just gonna let him
go back to them?

17:19.289 --> 17:20.623
- Margaret's gonna camp
out there

17:20.665 --> 17:21.875
after she drops him off.

17:21.916 --> 17:25.086
[phone ringing]
- Hmm.

17:25.128 --> 17:27.005
- Dhan found
Camilla's birth mother.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.299
- Great. Where is she?

17:29.341 --> 17:31.634
- Corner of 16th and K Street.

17:31.676 --> 17:34.721
[siren wailing]

17:36.264 --> 17:40.268
- What the hell?
Where is she?

17:40.310 --> 17:42.103
- [sighs]

17:42.145 --> 17:45.482
[dramatic music]

17:49.944 --> 17:50.320
.

17:50.362 --> 17:51.654
- Suicide prevention officer's
still ten minutes out.

17:53.114 --> 17:54.783
- If harming Camilla
is what drove Rosario up there,

17:54.824 --> 17:56.117
ten minutes is too late.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.660
- Damn it.
What is he doing up there?

17:57.702 --> 17:59.162
- Okay, look,
just give him a minute.

17:59.204 --> 18:03.124
[tense music]

18:03.166 --> 18:05.835
- It's over.

18:05.877 --> 18:07.170
I don't want no cops.

18:07.212 --> 18:08.922
- [exhales]

18:08.963 --> 18:12.300
- [whimpers]
- I'm not a cop.

18:12.342 --> 18:13.802
- [groans]

18:15.762 --> 18:18.264
- I'm just a guy who's been
right where you are.

18:20.183 --> 18:22.560
- I hurt my daughter.

18:25.355 --> 18:27.524
I wasn't a good mother.

18:29.109 --> 18:30.485
If I had been around,

18:30.527 --> 18:33.196
if I had chosen my daughter
over drugs,

18:33.238 --> 18:36.074
Camilla would still be with me.

18:36.116 --> 18:39.828
[sobbing]

18:39.869 --> 18:41.663
- I was missing once.

18:43.540 --> 18:45.792
Abandoned and betrayed
by people

18:45.834 --> 18:49.045
who were supposed
to look out for me.

18:49.087 --> 18:50.380
And despite those odds,

18:50.422 --> 18:53.258
I still eventually made it
back home.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.761
My friends and I
are looking for Camilla.

18:56.803 --> 18:59.597
We won't rest
until we have answers.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.227
Rosario. Rosario!
- [sobs]

19:06.896 --> 19:08.314
- Look at me.

19:11.067 --> 19:13.737
The world can be
a horrible place.

19:14.988 --> 19:16.740
That's just a fact.

19:17.741 --> 19:22.370
But sometimes...
sometimes the good guys win.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.705
My gut is telling me

19:23.747 --> 19:25.165
this might be
one of those times.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.584
And if I'm right,

19:27.625 --> 19:29.753
Camilla will need her mother.

19:29.794 --> 19:34.799
- * Here are some things
to be afraid of *

19:34.841 --> 19:39.471
* *

19:39.512 --> 19:43.308
* Growing old and tired *

19:43.350 --> 19:48.104
* *

19:48.146 --> 19:51.232
* Running out of songs *

19:51.274 --> 19:53.943
- What'd you say
to get her down?

19:55.653 --> 19:57.530
- Truth.

20:01.159 --> 20:02.952
- Where's Gabi?

20:04.454 --> 20:05.955
- She left.

20:09.584 --> 20:11.544
- * My body *

20:11.586 --> 20:15.590
* Never ever knowing
what to do *

20:15.632 --> 20:17.467
* Your hands and what they *

20:17.509 --> 20:19.761
* Your hands
and what they *

20:19.803 --> 20:23.848
* Your hands
and what they do *

20:23.890 --> 20:26.101
- I wanna go home.

20:26.142 --> 20:28.436
- I know, sweetie. I know.

20:28.478 --> 20:32.273
Think of dinner
like playing pretend.

20:32.315 --> 20:34.943
Sir likes to play pretend.

20:34.984 --> 20:39.781
At dinner, sometimes we read
from scripts like a play.

20:39.823 --> 20:41.324
[sighs]

20:43.576 --> 20:44.911
- You look pretty.

20:47.539 --> 20:50.250
- [chuckles]
Princess twirls.

20:50.291 --> 20:52.836
- [giggles] Princess twirls.

20:52.877 --> 20:55.005
[both laughing]

20:59.092 --> 21:01.594
[lock clicking]

21:06.349 --> 21:09.352
[door clicks, slams]

21:09.394 --> 21:12.397
[tense music]

21:12.439 --> 21:14.816
- Who's ready to eat?

21:14.858 --> 21:20.113
* *

21:20.155 --> 21:23.366
[doorbell chiming]

21:38.506 --> 21:40.717
[lock clicking]

21:43.386 --> 21:45.347
- It's kind of late
for house calls.

21:45.388 --> 21:47.015
- [chuckles] Okay.

21:47.057 --> 21:50.185
So much for wantin'
to make sure you're okay.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.604
You left without a word.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.106
- Once Rosario was down,
why stick around?

21:55.148 --> 21:56.483
Dhan had it handled.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.109
I needed to get
back to the case.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.071
- You sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

22:01.112 --> 22:03.448
It's fine. Seriously.

22:05.575 --> 22:07.577
I'll see you in the morning,
okay?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.834
[exhales]
[lock clicks]

22:15.835 --> 22:17.712
- 89% accurate is about as good

22:17.754 --> 22:19.839
as the department software
is gonna get.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.549
This is our guy.

22:22.217 --> 22:23.635
- You're up early.

22:23.677 --> 22:25.261
- I don't sleep much.

22:25.303 --> 22:28.139
Uh, Lacey let me in.

22:28.181 --> 22:30.934
- Zeke started it.
He asked for Trent's help.

22:30.975 --> 22:34.062
- He needed access to the PD's
facial-recognition software.

22:34.104 --> 22:38.358
- We present to you
the pervy older boyfriend.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.526
Eric Desmond.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.902
22, makes a habit of dating

22:40.944 --> 22:42.696
underage girls
off the Internet.

22:42.737 --> 22:44.280
Found himself
on the sex offender registry

22:44.322 --> 22:45.407
a couple years ago.

22:45.448 --> 22:46.866
No arrests since.

22:46.908 --> 22:48.785
- He's still MIA,
but I put out an APB.

22:48.827 --> 22:50.078
He'll pop up sooner or later.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.621
- Zeke, Lacey,
I want everything--

22:51.663 --> 22:53.289
and I mean everything--
on Eric Desmond.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.749
I want siblings, parents,

22:54.791 --> 22:56.626
allergies, favorite porn.

22:56.668 --> 22:58.420
- I am walking away
before I find out

22:58.461 --> 23:00.088
what illegal thing
you're gonna do

23:00.130 --> 23:01.214
with all that info.

23:01.256 --> 23:02.507
Besides, I need to process

23:02.549 --> 23:03.925
Camilla's foster parents
this morning.

23:03.967 --> 23:05.552
We got them
on child endangerment

23:05.593 --> 23:06.886
for those locks.
- Great.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.388
If I get Eric's coordinates
before you,

23:08.430 --> 23:09.973
you'll be my first call.

23:10.015 --> 23:11.266
Maybe second.

23:11.307 --> 23:18.523
* *

23:24.279 --> 23:25.739
- Can I ask you a question

23:25.780 --> 23:27.782
about your non-superpower
superpower?

23:27.824 --> 23:29.868
- You're gonna ask me anyway.

23:29.909 --> 23:32.996
- Did you develop it
looking for your son?

23:38.126 --> 23:40.462
- [sighs]

23:40.503 --> 23:42.630
13 years...

23:42.672 --> 23:45.008
looking for Jamie's face
in the crowd.

23:46.801 --> 23:49.846
One day I'll find it.

23:49.888 --> 23:52.140
Till then, I'll use
my non-superpower superpower

23:52.182 --> 23:55.643
to find other faces
in the crowd.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.020
- The boyfriend didn't do it.

23:57.062 --> 23:58.730
He's a little bitch-ass,
but he didn't do it.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.148
- Had an alibi.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.900
He did tell us
Camilla went to DCFS

24:01.941 --> 24:03.610
to petition for emancipation.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.445
She also wanted custody
of Deron.

24:05.487 --> 24:06.821
- Get Zeke.
Time to shift focus

24:06.863 --> 24:08.156
to the possibility
we're looking

24:08.198 --> 24:09.491
for a stranger kidnapping.

24:09.532 --> 24:10.992
- W-we haven't finished
ruling out

24:11.034 --> 24:12.577
suspects Camilla
might have known.

24:12.619 --> 24:13.870
- [sighs]
We'll get back to them.

24:13.912 --> 24:15.413
I'm trying to put myself
in her shoes.

24:15.455 --> 24:16.873
Trust me.
- Every time you say that

24:16.915 --> 24:18.875
you're somehow right.

24:18.917 --> 24:21.670
- Hey, I got your text.
I pulled the data

24:21.711 --> 24:23.421
on disappearances
of young girls

24:23.463 --> 24:25.882
in the D.C. area
over the last couple months.

24:25.924 --> 24:28.385
If we narrow it down
to the locations

24:28.426 --> 24:29.844
of alleged Camilla sightings

24:29.886 --> 24:31.179
based on the tip line,
there you go.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.639
- How about
the alleged sightings

24:32.681 --> 24:34.683
from the exact day
she went missing?

24:35.725 --> 24:37.852
- Gabi...
- In what is nothing short

24:37.894 --> 24:39.771
of a miraculous turn
of events,

24:39.813 --> 24:41.356
Sarah Holden has been found.

24:41.398 --> 24:42.691
The senator's daughter...
- Oh, thank God.

24:42.732 --> 24:44.317
- Was discovered disoriented

24:44.359 --> 24:46.695
wandering near an embankment
near the 295.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.322
[indistinct chatter]

24:49.364 --> 24:55.704
* *

24:55.745 --> 24:57.205
- What are the chances?

24:57.247 --> 24:58.707
- She's wearing
Camilla's sweatshirt.

24:58.748 --> 25:01.710
Those girls crossed.
But when? How?

25:01.751 --> 25:04.546
- This is the park we know
Sarah was snatched from.

25:04.587 --> 25:06.715
One of the tips in
the tip line placed Camilla

25:06.756 --> 25:09.175
on the green line that morning.
- Green line runs right through

25:09.217 --> 25:10.885
the northeast corner
of that park.

25:10.927 --> 25:12.971
- Wasn't Camilla headed
to see DCFS that morning?

25:13.013 --> 25:14.431
Their office is right here.

25:14.472 --> 25:17.267
Right across the street
from Garfield Park.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.772
These girls
were taken together.

25:27.527 --> 25:27.902
.

25:27.944 --> 25:29.279
- We just need two minutes
with the senator's daughter.

25:30.530 --> 25:31.990
- I told you
my hands are tied.

25:32.032 --> 25:34.576
- The only person
who knows what really happened,

25:34.617 --> 25:37.746
who can lead us to Camilla,
is that little girl.

25:37.787 --> 25:39.247
- I understand that,
which is why I'll speak

25:39.289 --> 25:41.958
to the senator personally
at an appropriate time.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.918
- There is no time.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.712
- That little girl is in shock.

25:45.754 --> 25:47.464
Okay?
She's been through enough.

25:47.505 --> 25:49.883
- [scoffs]

25:49.924 --> 25:51.134
This isn't about what's best

25:51.176 --> 25:53.845
for Sarah Holden
or Camilla, is it?

25:54.929 --> 25:57.974
This is about
your political aspirations

25:58.016 --> 26:01.978
and not wanting to ruffle
the senator's feathers.

26:02.020 --> 26:03.772
How do you sleep at night,
Captain?

26:03.813 --> 26:06.524
- I don't.
That's why I have ulcers.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.734
You're dismissed.

26:07.776 --> 26:10.278
[tense music]

26:10.320 --> 26:11.321
- Gabi, don't.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.864
- If we don't find
Camilla alive,

26:12.906 --> 26:14.657
that's on you now,
and I'll make sure

26:14.699 --> 26:15.742
the media never forgets it

26:15.784 --> 26:17.077
as long as you draw breath.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.370
Let's see
how that works for you

26:18.411 --> 26:20.538
when you lobby
for Chief of Police.

26:20.580 --> 26:21.998
- Did you just threaten me?

26:22.040 --> 26:23.833
- It's not a threat, Tony.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.168
It's a promise.

26:25.210 --> 26:30.882
* *

26:30.924 --> 26:32.342
- Gabi--
- Don't.

26:32.384 --> 26:34.803
Don't even think about
telling me to calm down.

26:34.844 --> 26:36.513
The senator's daughter
got away.

26:36.554 --> 26:37.847
Kidnappers are gonna panic.

26:37.889 --> 26:39.224
Camilla's out of time.
- I know.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.684
But threatening
the police captain...

26:40.725 --> 26:42.435
- Oh, for cryin' out loud.

26:42.477 --> 26:44.312
Don't you ever get sick
of being a damn yo-yo?

26:44.354 --> 26:46.356
One minute
you're all "thin blue line."

26:46.398 --> 26:47.774
The next minute
you're in my office

26:47.816 --> 26:48.983
pretending to care.

26:49.025 --> 26:50.360
Stop straddling the line,
Trent.

26:50.402 --> 26:53.446
Pick a damn side.
- There is only one side.

26:53.488 --> 26:56.825
I'm on Camilla's side.
- Then act like it.

27:02.205 --> 27:07.210
- The answer to climate change
is nuclear energy.

27:07.252 --> 27:10.797
Low-carbon.
No greenhouse gas emissions.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.092
[crickets chirping]

27:16.970 --> 27:21.850
- Yes. Decarbonizing
the power sector is key.

27:21.891 --> 27:23.309
But we're talking
about something

27:23.351 --> 27:25.603
that needs to be deployed
on a larger scale.

27:25.645 --> 27:27.313
- [chuckles]

27:27.355 --> 27:30.400
I'm so glad you've been reading
the books I left you.

27:30.442 --> 27:33.945
- You didn't exactly
make it optional.

27:33.987 --> 27:37.157
- * Oh, sweet child *

27:37.198 --> 27:40.243
* Oh, sweet child *

27:40.285 --> 27:42.495
* Close your eyes *

27:42.537 --> 27:45.206
- I would like
some more beef stew, please.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.345
- Why'd you take Bella?

27:58.386 --> 28:01.473
She's a baby.
- These questions

28:01.514 --> 28:03.058
are not part
of the script tonight.

28:03.099 --> 28:05.185
- Screw your script.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.146
Why her?
- Watch your mouth.

28:09.481 --> 28:11.149
[sighs]

28:12.984 --> 28:16.279
And don't you ever challenge me
like that again.

28:16.321 --> 28:17.447
Understood?

28:18.365 --> 28:21.076
[pots crash]
- [screams] My arm!

28:21.117 --> 28:23.703
- Is it too much to ask
for a decent meal

28:23.745 --> 28:25.663
and decent company?

28:25.705 --> 28:28.833
[Bella sobbing]

28:31.419 --> 28:33.630
- Run, Bella, run!

28:33.672 --> 28:37.384
[tense music]

28:37.425 --> 28:38.510
[keys jangle]

28:41.179 --> 28:45.392
- * It's dark outside *

28:49.187 --> 28:50.897
- You ever seen her like this?

28:50.939 --> 28:53.358
- She thinks
she failed Camilla.

28:59.864 --> 29:02.450
All right, time's up.

29:02.492 --> 29:04.869
Run some water
or get out the tub.

29:04.911 --> 29:07.163
- You can't use my words
against me.

29:07.205 --> 29:10.083
Besides, you were actually
in an empty bathtub,

29:10.125 --> 29:12.043
fully dressed, meltin' down.

29:12.085 --> 29:13.503
- So your tub's more metaphoric

29:13.545 --> 29:16.506
and your meltdown
is less spectacular.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.758
My point is,
you had your moment.

29:18.800 --> 29:20.510
Now it's time to act.

29:20.552 --> 29:22.512
What's next?

29:22.554 --> 29:23.847
- Why are you here?

29:23.888 --> 29:25.473
- What?

29:25.515 --> 29:27.851
- Why do you want
to work for me?

29:27.892 --> 29:31.354
- I mean,
this was always the plan...

29:31.396 --> 29:33.732
to learn at the feet
of the master.

29:33.773 --> 29:36.609
[pensive music]

29:36.651 --> 29:41.656
You overcame crazy odds
and you took over your destiny.

29:41.698 --> 29:44.117
You save lives.

29:44.159 --> 29:48.163
And I don't just mean
the forgotten ones.

29:48.204 --> 29:50.957
Every single person
in this office--

29:50.999 --> 29:52.959
Dhan, Zeke, Margaret--

29:53.001 --> 29:56.504
you found them at their worst
and you gave them purpose.

29:57.756 --> 30:02.469
You turned their trauma
into something positive.

30:02.510 --> 30:04.929
You're amazing.

30:04.971 --> 30:07.474
- I'm a mess.

30:07.515 --> 30:10.602
A mess that's good
with a contour brush.

30:12.896 --> 30:17.484
Lacey...you're brilliant.

30:17.525 --> 30:20.153
That's why I paid for you
to go to law school

30:20.195 --> 30:22.614
so you could be free
to do anything.

30:22.655 --> 30:24.240
- Uh-uh.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.243
I agreed to go to law school

30:27.285 --> 30:30.413
to keep your rule-breaking ass
out of prison.

30:32.999 --> 30:36.044
Which I can't wait to do.

30:37.212 --> 30:41.049
Now, this pity party over?

30:41.091 --> 30:43.259
Gonna go back to being, um...

30:43.301 --> 30:45.887
what'd they call us?

30:45.929 --> 30:50.141
Oh, yeah...vigilantes.

30:51.768 --> 30:53.269
[notification chimes]

30:56.481 --> 30:58.608
- "You didn't get this
from me."

30:58.650 --> 31:00.610
[notification chimes]

31:00.652 --> 31:02.737
We have a location.
Thank you, Trent.

31:02.779 --> 31:04.155
- [chuckles]

31:05.323 --> 31:08.702
- Now all I need
is my ace in the hole.

31:10.495 --> 31:11.663
- Yes.

31:12.997 --> 31:15.583
[siren wailing]

31:15.625 --> 31:16.918
- Senator.

31:16.960 --> 31:19.754
Hi, my name is Gabi Mose--
- I know who you are.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.257
Look, I'm sorry
about the other missing girl.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.384
- Her name is Camilla.

31:24.426 --> 31:26.261
- I wish we could help her.
I do.

31:26.302 --> 31:30.557
But right now,
Sarah is traumatized.

31:30.598 --> 31:33.018
And I have to protect
my daughter.

31:36.062 --> 31:38.398
- Senator, I know how you feel.

31:38.440 --> 31:41.317
My dear friend Margaret
who works with me,

31:41.359 --> 31:43.695
her son was only a year older
than your Sarah

31:43.737 --> 31:45.864
when he was kidnapped
at a bus station.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.867
[somber music]

31:48.908 --> 31:51.119
* *

31:51.161 --> 31:52.579
She's taken her trauma

31:52.620 --> 31:55.540
and turned it
into something positive.

31:55.582 --> 31:57.000
Can you?

31:57.042 --> 31:58.335
Please.

32:00.253 --> 32:02.505
- Yeah, Camilla
is my new friend.

32:02.547 --> 32:05.175
She's pretty,
but her eyes are sad.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.844
- Mm. How did you and Camilla
become friends?

32:07.886 --> 32:09.262
Did you meet at the park?

32:09.304 --> 32:10.722
- Not at first.

32:10.764 --> 32:12.682
When the bad man took me,

32:12.724 --> 32:15.852
she came running
and tried to fight him.

32:15.894 --> 32:17.312
He took her too.

32:17.354 --> 32:21.399
- Oh, my God.
Camilla tried to save her?

32:21.441 --> 32:23.276
- I know how scary
that must have been.

32:23.318 --> 32:25.111
But you're home safe now.

32:25.153 --> 32:27.447
- Yeah. Camilla helped me.

32:27.489 --> 32:31.076
She started making
a lot of noise in the house

32:31.117 --> 32:32.410
hitting things.

32:32.452 --> 32:35.872
The bad man got mad
and grabbed her.

32:35.914 --> 32:38.667
That's when she told me to run.

32:40.752 --> 32:42.837
- Can I ask you
a couple more questions?

32:42.879 --> 32:45.882
- Sure. I like you.
- Aw. I like you too.

32:45.924 --> 32:48.760
Do you know where Camilla is?

32:48.802 --> 32:51.012
Do you remember anything
about the bad man?

32:51.054 --> 32:53.390
- He had drawings on his neck.

32:53.431 --> 32:56.935
Spiderwebs
and gross, scary things.

32:56.976 --> 32:59.396
[suspenseful music]

32:59.437 --> 33:00.772
- I need the envelope.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.273
The one with the ammo
on the senator.

33:02.315 --> 33:03.900
- Ammo?
W-what do you mean, ammo?

33:03.942 --> 33:05.402
What's going on?

33:05.443 --> 33:06.861
- Senator, is there anyone
connected to you--

33:06.903 --> 33:09.072
anyone who had reason
to kidnap your daughter?

33:09.114 --> 33:11.241
- Not that I can think of.
- Honey...

33:11.282 --> 33:13.118
is this the bad man?

33:13.159 --> 33:17.414
- Why is the bad man
with my brother?

33:17.455 --> 33:20.291
- What is she talking about?

33:20.333 --> 33:21.710
- Why do you have this photo?

33:21.751 --> 33:25.296
- It was one of many
I was going to use to...

33:25.338 --> 33:27.716
encourage you
to let me speak to Sarah.

33:27.757 --> 33:29.259
Your son's addiction
is something

33:29.300 --> 33:30.760
you've worked hard
to keep under wraps,

33:30.802 --> 33:32.554
but my actions
are the least of your problems.

33:32.595 --> 33:34.931
Your daughter just ID'd
your son's dealer

33:34.973 --> 33:36.182
as her kidnapper.

33:36.224 --> 33:38.476
- I owed Aaron a lot of money.

33:38.518 --> 33:41.479
And, um,
when I couldn't pay it back,

33:41.521 --> 33:44.107
he took Sarah--
said it was to motivate me.

33:44.149 --> 33:46.609
- Aaron Nelson.
Trent, hurry.

33:46.651 --> 33:49.154
Sarah was a ransom kidnapping.
Now that she's home,

33:49.195 --> 33:51.156
he has no reason
to keep Camilla alive.

33:56.077 --> 33:56.494
.

33:56.536 --> 33:57.787
- Get him back to the station.
He gave us nothing.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.958
[dramatic music]

34:02.000 --> 34:07.839
* *

34:07.881 --> 34:09.841
[swing set squeaking]
- Camilla?

34:12.552 --> 34:15.305
[indistinct radio chatter]
Camilla, honey?

34:15.347 --> 34:17.223
Make a noise
if you can hear us.

34:17.265 --> 34:18.683
Camilla? Come on, baby.

34:18.725 --> 34:19.768
- Camilla!
- Camilla!

34:19.809 --> 34:22.729
- Camilla.
- Camilla!

34:22.771 --> 34:24.022
Camilla!

34:24.064 --> 34:25.648
[light clicks]

34:31.237 --> 34:34.074
[drone buzzing]

34:35.033 --> 34:37.494
[phone ringing]
- You guys find her?

34:37.535 --> 34:39.079
- No, not yet.
- I'm not picking up

34:39.120 --> 34:40.955
a heat signature anywhere.
If she's still there,

34:40.997 --> 34:42.916
she's under concrete or metal.

34:42.957 --> 34:45.043
- Well, this house was built
in the '60s.

34:45.085 --> 34:47.712
Uh, D.C. was big
on fallout shelters then.

34:47.754 --> 34:49.756
Pull up the plans.
See if you can find any--

34:49.798 --> 34:51.216
- Cellars and military-style
bunkers.

34:51.257 --> 34:53.718
Already did.
There is nothing on the plans

34:53.760 --> 34:55.428
or the neighbors too.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.431
- Well, what about between
properties?

35:01.810 --> 35:03.311
- Gabi, the ground under you,

35:03.353 --> 35:05.188
is it sloping downhill
toward that fence?

35:05.230 --> 35:06.815
- Yeah. Why?
- If there's one thing

35:06.856 --> 35:08.566
I know as an agoraphobe,
it's houses.

35:08.608 --> 35:10.068
Means there's a water source.

35:10.110 --> 35:11.736
Like-like a ravine
or something nearby,

35:11.778 --> 35:13.530
which means some sort of--
- Culvert opening.

35:13.571 --> 35:15.240
Okay, come on, guys.
I need your help.

35:15.281 --> 35:16.991
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

35:17.033 --> 35:22.455
* *

35:22.497 --> 35:24.541
- Damn it. Wait.

35:32.465 --> 35:33.925
- Hey, start digging.

35:38.763 --> 35:40.432
Come on, help me, help me.

35:40.473 --> 35:41.641
Help me dig!

35:41.683 --> 35:43.143
Wait. Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

35:44.310 --> 35:45.562
[latch clicks]

35:48.064 --> 35:49.190
[hatch thuds]

35:50.692 --> 35:53.778
- I got her. I got her.

35:53.820 --> 35:54.863
Hi.

35:54.904 --> 35:57.115
Camilla, look at me, honey.

35:57.157 --> 35:59.117
Come on, baby, look at me.

35:59.159 --> 36:00.744
Hey, honey.

36:02.787 --> 36:06.583
- Are you--are you here for me?

36:06.624 --> 36:09.044
- Yes. Yeah.

36:09.085 --> 36:11.504
You're safe.

36:11.546 --> 36:13.506
You're safe, baby.

36:14.341 --> 36:16.968
You're safe. You're safe.

36:17.010 --> 36:24.059
* *

36:27.937 --> 36:30.482
- Thank you for finding her
and Deron a new home

36:30.523 --> 36:32.650
while Rosario gets help.

36:35.904 --> 36:40.158
[heartwarming music]

36:40.200 --> 36:42.118
- [sobbing]

36:42.160 --> 36:49.209

36:53.713 --> 36:55.382
- You're safe now.

36:55.423 --> 36:56.966
Both of you did great.

36:57.008 --> 37:00.136
And we'll find him,
this guy you call Sir.

37:00.178 --> 37:02.514
That's a promise.

37:02.555 --> 37:04.849
- You can't promise us that.

37:04.891 --> 37:06.518
If he was really gone

37:06.559 --> 37:08.019
by the time
you got to the house,

37:08.061 --> 37:09.229
that means

37:09.270 --> 37:11.523
the man that took me
from my family...

37:11.564 --> 37:14.192
[tense music]

37:14.234 --> 37:16.194
Took us...

37:17.904 --> 37:19.364

38:21.634 --> 38:23.345

38:26.264 --> 38:28.266
- We're not the same.

38:28.308 --> 38:31.353
- You're right. You're not.
Not anymore.

38:31.394 --> 38:33.730
'Cause someone reached out
a hand to you.

38:33.772 --> 38:37.150
Someone who understood

39:38.503 --> 39:40.630
You want to be out there.
But you're doin' good.

what to help with,

42:40.894 --> 42:43.021

Zeke, you ready
to trace the call?

42:44.397 --> 42:46.149
- On it.
- Call the cops, she dies.

42:46.191 --> 42:47.859

in the wrong direction.

42:47.901 --> 42:49.361

would never be found
