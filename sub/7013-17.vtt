00:06.172 --> 00:08.902
Eric, what are you doing eating?

00:08.975 --> 00:11.637
Well, it's mainly for survival.

00:13.313 --> 00:17.272
But I also enjoy the fruity taste.

00:17.350 --> 00:21.184
I told you to replace
the hubcap on the Vista Cruiser.

00:21.254 --> 00:23.984
So, what is it?
You're mature enough to get married...

00:24.057 --> 00:26.582
but not mature enough
to replace a hubcap?

00:26.659 --> 00:29.924
Well, let's see.
You took away my keys, so I can't drive.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.988
And you took away my job,
so I can't afford a new hubcap.

00:33.066 --> 00:37.867
You also took away my self-esteem,
so I have no pride in my job or my possessions.

00:39.839 --> 00:42.307
For gosh sake,
you've been arguing for two weeks.

00:42.375 --> 00:45.538
Now stop it.
Help me with this crossword puzzle.

00:46.846 --> 00:50.077
I need a four-letter word...

00:50.150 --> 00:52.084
for disappointment.

00:52.152 --> 00:54.484
Eric.

00:58.758 --> 01:01.022
[Gasps]
It fits.

01:06.666 --> 01:09.191
Well, now, that can't be right.

01:10.603 --> 01:12.730
So, he's like, "Replace the hubcap."

01:12.806 --> 01:16.799
And I'm like,
"Hey, why don't you replace the hubcap."

01:16.876 --> 01:21.006
And that is why
I'm trimming the hedges.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.015
Yeah.

01:23.083 --> 01:27.042
I only mess with Red when
I really need the discipline.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.111
He's a total hard-ass.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.658
Hard-ass? Take another look,
my friend. It jiggles when he wiggles.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.823
Man, I don't know what
the hell the deal is with Leo.

01:39.899 --> 01:42.163
He told me to take
a week off two weeks ago...

01:42.235 --> 01:44.999
- and I haven't heard from him since.
- We need to find him...

01:45.071 --> 01:48.199
'cause we're all out of film,
if you know what I mean.

01:48.274 --> 01:52.802
I need film. Then I could take pictures
of Nina and me doing it.

01:53.947 --> 01:58.043
Fez, film doesn't
really mean "film."

01:58.118 --> 02:01.212
Who cares? Because for
the first time in my life...

02:01.287 --> 02:03.653
doin' it really means "doin' it."

02:08.328 --> 02:11.593
So, I guess this is the way...

02:11.664 --> 02:15.828
an immature, engaged,
high school dumb-ass...

02:15.902 --> 02:20.566
with no car, no job and no money
trims the hedges.

02:23.109 --> 02:26.476
That was like eight burns
in one sentence.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.943
An octo-burn.

02:32.018 --> 02:34.680
Let's get the hell out of here.

02:38.591 --> 02:42.652
Okay, you two,
since you won't bond on your own...

02:42.729 --> 02:45.027
I have signed you up
for the father/son competition...

02:45.098 --> 02:49.899
at this year's Point Place
Paul Bunyan Pioneer DayJamboree.

02:53.139 --> 02:56.040
- Kitty, that sounds horrible.
- Yeah, I agree.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.134
You hear that?
We've already bonded.

03:00.313 --> 03:02.372
No, it's too late.
It's for charity.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.645
<i>Now, don't forget...</i>

03:06.886 --> 03:10.378
your commemorative coonskin caps.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.862
Huh.

03:18.932 --> 03:22.925
So that's what
you'd look like with hair.

- I'd kiss you...

04:11.551 --> 04:14.987
but I'm afraid your hat will wake
up and scratch my eyes out.

04:18.224 --> 04:22.923
So, you guys, Joanne has been chosen
to emcee Pioneer Days. Tell 'em why, baby.

04:22.996 --> 04:26.159
I won the tobacco-spitting
contest last year.

04:27.233 --> 04:29.394
What a lady.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.960
I'll be mannin'
the hard-cider booth.

04:32.038 --> 04:35.337
It's a good way to raise money
'cause of all the drunks.

04:35.408 --> 04:39.902
Oh! Ooh, people are signing in.
Come on. Get excited, you two!

04:42.448 --> 04:44.848
Well, howdy, newcomers!
I'm Charlie Miller.

04:44.917 --> 04:48.444
You can call me Charlie.
This is my son, Mitch.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.015
You can call me "ladies man."

04:54.294 --> 04:57.092
- "Ladies man."
- Did somebody call me?

04:58.298 --> 05:02.234
I'm Red Forman.
This is my son, Eric.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.566
You can call him dumb-ass.

05:07.807 --> 05:10.139
Well, we don't use the A-S-S word.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.439
We have a reputation to uphold.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.776
We're the two-time champs.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.611
Little secret, Red. I tell Mitch
it doesn't matter how we do...

05:17.684 --> 05:19.618
as long as we're together.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.517
- And why is that, Dad?
- 'Cause we bad!

05:21.587 --> 05:24.283
- Oh, yeah, that's right! We bad!
- We bad!

05:24.357 --> 05:27.884
All right. Dad, they have a catch phrase.
Hey, what's ours?

05:27.960 --> 05:29.951
Shut up, dumb-ass.

05:31.631 --> 05:35.328
Yeah. Shut up, dumb-ass.
Okay. Yeah.

05:39.038 --> 05:43.475
No wonder Leo hasn't told me to
come to work. There's no work to come to.

05:43.543 --> 05:47.001
- Mmm, did he leave a note?
- [Fez] Nope.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.071
Just this.

05:52.985 --> 05:56.887
<i>You know, he looked dirty...</i>

05:56.956 --> 05:59.686
but he always smelled
like clean sheets.

06:01.961 --> 06:03.986
You're talking about him
like he's gone, man.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.861
He would have told me
if he was leaving town.

06:06.933 --> 06:10.869
Maybe...
a U.F.O. Appeared.

06:13.106 --> 06:16.303
And it shot down a beam
and made everyone...

06:16.376 --> 06:19.675
and everything inside
the Fotohut vanish.

06:22.448 --> 06:25.008
Yeah, like an apparition.

06:25.084 --> 06:28.884
Kelso, you don't even know
what an apparition is.

06:28.955 --> 06:32.186
Hey, if I can't use words
I don't understand...

06:32.258 --> 06:34.954
this is gonna be
one quiet afternoon.

06:37.663 --> 06:39.597
Let's get started.

06:39.665 --> 06:41.929
"To make room
for a new tradin' post...

06:42.001 --> 06:45.767
"Paul Bunyan needs to
clear-cut 200 acres of forest.

06:45.838 --> 06:48.773
The first team to chop
25 logs wins."

06:48.841 --> 06:50.775
And... chop!

06:55.848 --> 06:58.112
Um, excuse me.
My ax is stuck.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.175
Way to go, Mitch.

07:01.354 --> 07:05.017
- That's right! We bad!
- Oh, yeah, we bad!

07:05.091 --> 07:07.116
Pull the ax out, Eric.

07:07.193 --> 07:09.161
I can't. It's really stuck in there.

07:09.228 --> 07:13.631
And you think you're ready to be married.
You can't even chop wood.

07:13.699 --> 07:17.135
What are you gonna do for heat
in the winter, burn comic books?

07:17.203 --> 07:21.333
Hmm, I don't know. I guess I would
probably just turn on the heater!

07:21.407 --> 07:24.706
How can Eric and Red
be fighting already?

07:26.379 --> 07:29.837
Well, it's almost as if forcing them
together against their will...

07:29.916 --> 07:32.885
and giving them sharp objects...

07:32.952 --> 07:36.183
wasn't really the best way
to get them to make up.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.755
Another hard cider, Bob.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.761
Make it a double.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.002
Well, we couldn't find Leo.
We just checked all his hangouts.

07:55.074 --> 07:59.306
- The Hub.
- Alley behind The Hub.

07:59.378 --> 08:03.815
- Fatso Burger.
- Alley behind the Fatso Burger.

08:03.883 --> 08:07.580
Hyde, when are you gonna accept
the fact that Leo just bailed?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.884
Man, he would not leave
without saying good-bye, okay?

08:10.957 --> 08:13.448
I know him better
than I know my own father.

08:13.526 --> 08:16.723
I'd like to do it
with Nina in an alley.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.490
My bare ass...

08:25.705 --> 08:28.333
pressed up against a cold Dumpster.

08:39.018 --> 08:43.784
You know, we're getting killed here
thanks to your screwing up that last event.

08:43.856 --> 08:48.259
All you had to do was build a cabin
out of Lincoln Logs.

08:52.398 --> 08:54.457
Well, I thought I'd score
some extra points...

08:54.534 --> 08:57.833
by building the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

08:57.904 --> 09:01.362
The <i>Millennium</i> what?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.206
If that's a <i>Star Wars</i> thing,
I'm gonna kick you in the ass.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.147
It's... not a <i>Star Wars</i> thing.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.049
It's a very rare falcon...

09:17.189 --> 09:19.987
that can do the Kessel Run
in under six parsecs.

09:21.761 --> 09:24.025
Hey, just remember, guys.
It's not whether you win or lose.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.030
It's how you play the game.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.794
Unfortunately, you guys
don't know how to play the game.

09:28.868 --> 09:32.599
Oh, hey. We don't wanna rub it
in their face they're big losers.

09:32.672 --> 09:34.902
- Oh!
- Oh!

09:34.974 --> 09:37.568
I don't know.
It just came out.

09:39.245 --> 09:43.011
This is the worst Point Place Paul Bunyan
Pioneer Days Jamboree ever.

09:51.743 --> 09:54.974
And now, the cow-milking event.

09:55.047 --> 09:57.607
Could you just award us
our first-place points right now?

09:57.683 --> 10:02.518
It'd save a lot of time and embarrassment
for our friends over here.

10:02.588 --> 10:05.853
You know, it kinda would.

10:05.924 --> 10:10.327
"Babe the Blue Ox needs lots of calcium
to carry Paul Bunyan's lumber...

10:10.395 --> 10:13.125
"or his brittle bones
will snap and he'll die.

10:13.198 --> 10:15.189
"The first team to fill
their barrel with milk...

10:15.267 --> 10:18.236
and save Babe
from osteoporosis wins."

10:18.303 --> 10:20.396
[Cackling]

10:21.406 --> 10:22.964
And... milk!

10:26.411 --> 10:31.280
- Um, hey! There's something wrong with our cow.
- [Lowing]

10:31.350 --> 10:33.818
Her things aren't workin'!

10:33.886 --> 10:36.684
You can't just yank on 'em.

10:36.755 --> 10:39.815
Red never was much for foreplay.

10:42.961 --> 10:45.486
- Keep it comin', Mitch.
- This is amazing.

10:45.564 --> 10:47.998
It's like she was waiting
for my magic fingers...

10:48.066 --> 10:52.400
to coax that sweet liquid
right out of her teats.

10:52.471 --> 10:55.497
- Move over, Dad. I'll show you how it's done.
- What makes you think-

10:58.510 --> 11:00.341
Go, Eric. Go.

11:00.412 --> 11:03.643
Well, honey, good for you.
[Chuckles]

11:06.118 --> 11:09.349
Mitch, they're winning.
What happened to your magic fingers?

11:09.421 --> 11:12.219
Get off my back, old man!

11:12.291 --> 11:14.282
Dad, here.

11:17.129 --> 11:19.825
<i>[Joanne]</i>

11:21.934 --> 11:25.665
You let me down, son.
I thought you were better than that.

11:25.737 --> 11:28.638
What are you gonna do?
Lock me in the closet again?

11:28.707 --> 11:31.801
He locks me in the closet!

11:31.877 --> 11:35.108
It's a walk-in!
It's a walk-in.

11:37.149 --> 11:40.812
So, Dad, what do you say now?

11:40.886 --> 11:43.548
Why are you so good at that?

11:49.595 --> 11:51.825
How are we gonna break
into Leo's apartment?

11:54.900 --> 11:58.199
[Groans]
We need a credit card to slip in the door.

11:58.270 --> 12:00.329
Ponch used one on <i>CHiPs</i> once...

12:00.405 --> 12:03.033
and the lady he rescued
was so grateful they did it.

12:03.108 --> 12:08.045
Kelso, if we had a credit card, we could buy
a sledgehammer and break down the door.

12:08.113 --> 12:12.106
If we had a credit card,
I'd be butt-deep in Jordache right now.

12:20.626 --> 12:23.459
- Oh, Leo, man.
- I'm gonna kick him, see if he's okay.

12:23.528 --> 12:27.362
- Kelso, no.
- Well, at least throw something at him.

12:27.432 --> 12:29.366
If he's asleep, he'll wake up.

12:29.434 --> 12:33.894
If he's dead, you can say
you threw something at a dead guy.

12:33.972 --> 12:39.501
Uuh! Aah! Officer, I have
a prescription for that.

12:39.578 --> 12:41.773
No, relax, bud.
We're just looking for Leo.

12:41.847 --> 12:46.045
Oh, he left.
I'm his cousin, Eli.

12:47.352 --> 12:50.412
Really, he just left?
He didn't call or anything?

12:50.489 --> 12:52.957
Oh, Steven, I'm sorry.

12:53.025 --> 12:55.687
Don't take it personal, Hyde.
You know Leo never liked phones.

12:55.761 --> 12:59.128
He said he could hear voices in 'em.

12:59.197 --> 13:02.724
By the way, he left a note.

13:02.801 --> 13:05.964
Do any of you know
a kid named Heidi?

13:06.038 --> 13:09.166
He means Hyde. That's me, man.
[Excitedly] The note's for me!

13:10.842 --> 13:14.073
[Coolly] I mean, the note's for me.

Point Place for some gas.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.009
All right.

13:53.085 --> 13:56.543

I mean, thinking.

14:15.607 --> 14:17.598

14:18.944 --> 14:21.174
I want you and Eric to get married.

14:22.547 --> 14:25.641

I know it's just the cider talking...

Look, Donna.
It's me, your dad.

15:15.834 --> 15:18.667
Well, Mitch, I hope you're happy.

15:18.737 --> 15:22.764
How can I be happy?
Our whole life is a lie.

15:22.841 --> 15:25.708
Am I really supposed to believe
that Kathy is my little sister?

15:25.777 --> 15:30.680
She doesn't look anything like me.
She is Cuban, for Pete's sake!

15:30.749 --> 15:33.183
And what about
your Friday bowling nights?

15:33.251 --> 15:36.118
I looked in your bowling bag.
You know what I found?

15:36.188 --> 15:38.179
Butt-less chaps!

15:40.492 --> 15:42.426
What's with the butt-less chaps?

15:44.629 --> 15:47.097
Your mother's inhibited.

15:47.165 --> 15:50.157
[Groaning]

15:51.570 --> 15:53.504
[Loud Groan]

15:53.572 --> 15:56.336
Don't shake hands with that guy.

16:01.613 --> 16:03.877
I can't close my mouth.

16:03.949 --> 16:06.941
Can you close your mouth?

16:07.018 --> 16:10.647
It's really starting
to freak me out.

16:10.722 --> 16:12.713
Leo's the best.

16:14.326 --> 16:17.295
Leo made me a grilled cheese once.

16:17.362 --> 16:21.458
He used butter and made
the crust extra toasty.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.524
He forgot cheese.

16:25.837 --> 16:29.705
I'm gonna miss that
grilled-cheese-makin' son of a bitch.

16:29.774 --> 16:32.868
You know, one time,
I heard Leo talking on the phone...

16:32.944 --> 16:35.071
and he was speaking Chinese.

16:35.146 --> 16:38.707
So I said,
"Leo, stop speaking Chinese."

16:38.783 --> 16:43.311
So he turned around,
and it wasn't Leo.

16:43.388 --> 16:45.720
It was a Chinese guy.

16:47.158 --> 16:49.786
[Sighs]
You know, I'll never forget that.

16:51.730 --> 16:56.463
I'm just sad I'll never get to see his face
when I tell him I did it with Nina.

16:56.535 --> 17:00.266
Actually, I'd like to see
my face when I do it with Nina.

17:01.273 --> 17:03.935
I bet I look like a stallion.

17:07.779 --> 17:11.806
So today we sit in this circle
in honor of Leo.

17:11.883 --> 17:15.114
He was my boss.
He was my friend.

17:15.185 --> 17:18.622
He was my connection.
To Leo.

17:18.690 --> 17:20.681
[All]
To Leo!

17:24.194 --> 17:26.823
Well, I found out...

17:26.897 --> 17:29.890
how much cider is too much cider.

17:30.902 --> 17:33.166
A barrel?

17:33.238 --> 17:35.172
Shut it!

17:35.240 --> 17:38.698
Great news. Little Timmy Stinson
cut his finger off in a whittling event.

17:38.777 --> 17:41.109
They're out.
We're in second place.

17:41.179 --> 17:44.615
And if we win this next event,
we'll be champions.

17:44.683 --> 17:47.379
And maybe even friends.

17:52.824 --> 17:54.758
Look, we've had a rough day...

17:54.826 --> 17:58.227
and we've both said some things
that we didn't mean.

17:58.296 --> 18:01.060
But we've got to pull it together
for this final event.

18:01.132 --> 18:03.293
Just tell me where you go
Friday nights.

18:03.368 --> 18:08.135
I rent a motel room and I lock
the door and I cry, okay?

18:08.206 --> 18:11.198
I cry like a damn baby.

18:12.644 --> 18:14.805
Why do you need
butt-less chaps for that?

18:16.114 --> 18:18.241
Okay, it's time for our final event.

18:18.316 --> 18:23.879
"Transport your gold in a genuine
covered wagon to Pioneer Pete's"-

18:23.955 --> 18:26.219
You know what? I'm tired.
Pull the wagons. Go.

18:26.291 --> 18:28.225
<i>## [Man Singing Country]</i>

18:47.379 --> 18:50.542
<i>## [Ends]</i>

19:03.361 --> 19:07.491
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! [Grunts]
- [Panting]

19:07.565 --> 19:09.556
<i>Ooh!</i>

19:10.735 --> 19:13.670
- Mm-hmm.
- Who's bad?

19:15.674 --> 19:18.199
- We bad.
- That's right.

19:18.276 --> 19:21.006
- We bad!
- We bad! We bad!

19:21.079 --> 19:26.449
Okay, it's time for Pioneer Pete
to claim his gold!

19:27.919 --> 19:30.251
I saw that, Donna.

19:32.023 --> 19:35.515
Well, I'm sorry. I know you think
I'm a disappointment and stuff.

19:36.594 --> 19:40.030
Hey. I'm proud of how we did.

19:41.766 --> 19:46.760
Look, I know what it's like to have
your dad riding you all the time.

19:46.838 --> 19:50.296
My old man was always on me
to go to engineering school.

19:50.375 --> 19:54.311
And when I didn't, he was so mad
we didn't talk for a year.

19:54.379 --> 19:58.611
So, you're the softy in your family?

20:02.287 --> 20:07.452
See, my dad's vision
for my life was wrong.

20:07.525 --> 20:10.153
Only I knew what was best.

20:10.228 --> 20:12.389
Not my dad.
You understand what I'm saying?

20:15.834 --> 20:18.462
Wow. Are-Are you
admitting that you're wrong...

20:18.536 --> 20:20.800
that it's okay for me
and Donna to get married?

20:20.872 --> 20:23.238
What?

20:24.709 --> 20:27.439
No, no.

20:27.512 --> 20:30.504
I'm saying that my dad
was wrong and I was right.

20:32.417 --> 20:34.942
Just like I'm right now.

20:36.354 --> 20:39.915
The point is, I'm always right,
so break it off!

20:44.496 --> 20:47.363
Well, at least
you're still happy for us.

20:47.432 --> 20:52.062
Please, Donna, I'm standing right here.
There's no need to yell!

20:57.842 --> 21:01.869
You know what?
I don't care what my dad says.

21:01.946 --> 21:05.109
I am more committed
to this marriage than ever.

21:05.183 --> 21:08.550
Well, after seeing how you handled
that cow, so am I.

21:16.060 --> 21:21.430
Okay. So you raise the ax,
and you bring it straight down.

21:21.499 --> 21:24.957
- Okay? Raise. Bring down.
- That's easy.

21:25.036 --> 21:29.769
Now, it's all about leverage.
You know, torque.

21:29.841 --> 21:33.072
Okay. I... don't know
what either of those is...

21:33.144 --> 21:35.078
but I'll give it a shot.

21:38.783 --> 21:40.774
<i>[Cow Lowing]</i>

21:44.022 --> 21:45.956
- Let's get outta here.
- Right behind you.
