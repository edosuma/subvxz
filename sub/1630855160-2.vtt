00:09.280 --> 00:11.040
Your liaison.
My what?

00:11.040 --> 00:13.440
Some cop from London. He's coming
with the girl's mother.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.520
I'd like you to meet Detective
Sergeant Max Drummond from London.

00:16.520 --> 00:18.240
Greg Hardy, old friend of the family.

00:18.240 --> 00:20.560
Oh, please. I know who you are, sir.

00:20.560 --> 00:22.200
Leader of the Opposition.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.360
Obviously, you've been told
that this is my first case.

00:24.360 --> 00:26.480
Only now, by you.

00:26.480 --> 00:28.680
Maybe she feels threatened by you.

00:28.680 --> 00:31.640
Maybe she just doesn't like me.
Wouldn't be the only one.

00:31.640 --> 00:33.480
I didn't say I don't like you.

00:33.480 --> 00:35.880
You're friends with Tom's father.

00:35.880 --> 00:38.800
Lloyd? I do some work for him.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.280
I am so sorry for your loss.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.800
She was a wonderful girl.
Thank you.

00:42.800 --> 00:44.240
She was murdered, Dad.

00:44.240 --> 00:45.760
I told you this could
become a problem.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.280
I said I'd fix it.

00:47.280 --> 00:51.880
Yesterday, there was a transfer
out of her account for $20,000

00:51.880 --> 00:53.160
to EG Paton.

00:53.160 --> 00:54.600
Erica.

01:08.200 --> 01:10.080
(PHONE RINGS)

01:13.200 --> 01:15.320
(ON PHONE) This is Anna.
Leave a message.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.320
(BEEP!)

01:16.320 --> 01:17.600
It's me.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.480
I tried you last night,
but must have missed you.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.840
Ooh. I'm seeing Tori later.

01:26.840 --> 01:28.280
I'll send her your love.

01:30.440 --> 01:32.000
Text me if you want.

01:53.480 --> 01:55.480
I wish we'd got on better.

01:57.720 --> 02:00.240
I always thought we'd have the time
to put it right.

02:01.920 --> 02:04.120
She thought I put my career first.

02:06.080 --> 02:08.200
She was always more important.

02:09.920 --> 02:12.080
But she always noticed
when I WASN'T there,

02:12.080 --> 02:13.680
not when I WAS.

02:15.880 --> 02:19.160
As a father, you want to
protect your child,

02:19.160 --> 02:21.560
make sure no harm comes to them.

02:23.880 --> 02:25.240
I failed her.

02:27.720 --> 02:29.960
She couldn't have asked
for a better dad.

02:48.640 --> 02:51.720
Would you rather sit
away from the window?

02:51.720 --> 02:53.800
There's no hiding from a long lens.

02:53.800 --> 02:56.320
One way or another,
they'll get their pic.

02:56.320 --> 02:59.720
Let's at least hope
they show some sensitivity.

02:59.720 --> 03:01.160
Paps?

03:03.120 --> 03:06.680
Morning. Abigail, Simon,
how are you this morning?

03:08.920 --> 03:11.120
You've seen the papers, I assume.

03:11.120 --> 03:14.000
I thought I'd spare myself.
What are they saying?

03:14.000 --> 03:15.440
It's all supportive.

03:15.440 --> 03:18.040
The PM is keeping you
off the front page.

03:18.040 --> 03:20.240
God, what's he done now?

03:20.240 --> 03:22.000
It's six years old.

03:22.000 --> 03:25.720
Shows him smacking his dog
in a park.

03:25.720 --> 03:27.920
There are calls for his resignation.

03:27.920 --> 03:29.960
For smacking a dog six years ago?

03:29.960 --> 03:31.400
Oh, there's more.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.240
(BARKING)
Come here, you stupid bitch.

03:33.240 --> 03:36.840
Claims he was shouting at the dog,
but then his wife walks into view.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.840
His popularity has plummeted.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.880
It wasn't high to begin with.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.480
Well, the Telegraph says
it's time for him to go.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.760
I'm told the foreign secretary
is quietly counting numbers.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.080
I missed a call from him
this morning.

03:53.080 --> 03:55.440
I thought he was ringing
to offer his condolences.

03:55.440 --> 03:58.160
I'm sure he was.
Before asking for your support.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.000
I think it's best
you remain above the fray for now.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.640
Just make up an excuse
for not getting involved.

04:05.640 --> 04:08.320
Well, I do have a valid one.

04:08.320 --> 04:10.600
Yes. So sorry.

04:12.320 --> 04:14.640
Max.

04:14.640 --> 04:16.200
Detective Sergeant Meg Driscoll.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.640
We met yesterday.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.520
We're not likely to forget.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.080
No, of course not.

04:21.080 --> 04:24.240
I just wanted to brief you
on the investigation.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.760
The hotel have offered us
a quiet room.

04:31.280 --> 04:35.920
You're happy for Mr...Barber
to be present for this?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.320
I want him to be just that.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.240
It's just that family briefings
are usually reserved for family.

04:44.760 --> 04:46.440
Right.

04:46.440 --> 04:49.160
Well, we've ascertained
that the deceased...

04:50.800 --> 04:52.840
Sorry, Sophie.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.640
I'll start that again.

04:55.640 --> 04:58.280
We've ascertained that Sophie
was last seen

04:58.280 --> 05:00.240
at 11:12 on Friday night.

05:00.240 --> 05:01.960
The following morning,
when she didn't come home,

05:01.960 --> 05:04.280
her flatmate, Erica Paton,
reported her missing.

05:04.280 --> 05:09.160
Hang on. So, you're saying the last
sighting of her was just after 11?

05:09.160 --> 05:11.480
Don't you have cameras
all over Sydney?

05:11.480 --> 05:13.920
Yes, and we're still checking
those in the vicinity,

05:13.920 --> 05:15.920
but so far, without success.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.120
She was filmed leaving a bar
in the city centre

05:19.120 --> 05:21.640
and then she just disappeared.

05:21.640 --> 05:23.880
We think that
she might have hailed a taxi.

05:23.880 --> 05:26.040
Have you checked with
the cab companies?

05:26.040 --> 05:29.240
Of course.
And the rideshare services.

05:29.240 --> 05:31.440
But no-one picked her up.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.400
But it is possible that
she paid a cabbie cash

05:34.400 --> 05:36.720
and he just did it off the books.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.760
We're trying to build up a picture
of Sophie's life here in Sydney.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.240
It would help if you could tell us
what you knew of it.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.720
She was 19.

05:46.720 --> 05:48.960
She didn't share much with me,

05:48.960 --> 05:50.920
and I knew better than to ask.

05:52.160 --> 05:53.480
You saw her?

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
Yeah. A few times.

05:56.800 --> 06:00.680
When I was down here on business,
I'd go out to dinner with her.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.800
I looked forward to it.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.600
And I'd always give her
a bit of cash.

06:05.600 --> 06:07.880
She liked that, of course.

06:07.880 --> 06:10.160
You always were a soft touch.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.520
So you don't think
she had much money, then?

06:12.520 --> 06:15.480
Well, she had her job with Lloyd,
Tom's father.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.200
That won't have paid much.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.720
I doubt her income
covered her spending.

06:19.720 --> 06:21.920
She seemed to go out a lot.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.800
Do you know if she was
a heavy user of drugs?

06:26.840 --> 06:31.680
It's just that the toxicology report
revealed MDMA in her system.

06:31.680 --> 06:33.560
She was young.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.680
She liked to party.
She wasn't an addict.

06:35.680 --> 06:39.080
I wasn't suggesting that she was.

06:39.080 --> 06:43.120
(CLEARS THROAT) Did you ever visit
her flat, Mr Chalcott?

06:43.120 --> 06:44.720
Just the once.

06:44.720 --> 06:46.400
Did you meet her flatmate, Erica?

06:46.400 --> 06:48.400
Yes. She was nice.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.200
You liked her, didn't you?

06:50.200 --> 06:53.040
I only spoke to her once, over Zoom.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.600
And her and Sophie got on?
They seemed to.

06:55.600 --> 06:57.360
They spent enough time together.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.240
So, no issues then?

06:59.240 --> 07:02.040
Erica was the last person
to see Sophie alive.

07:02.040 --> 07:04.000
Is that the reason
you're interested in her?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.600
It seems pretty thin to me.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.720
No. We're exploring
a number of lines of inquiry.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.840
And as far as I can tell,
you're getting nowhere.

07:12.360 --> 07:15.520
I understand this is your first
investigation, Detective Sergeant.

07:20.320 --> 07:22.280
As lead detective, yes.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.480
But I have worked in homicide
for more than two years.

07:24.480 --> 07:26.680
It's not unusual for the police
to have no firm leads

07:26.680 --> 07:28.640
this early in an investigation.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.840
The efforts of DS Driscoll
and her colleagues

07:30.840 --> 07:33.480
have uncovered a line of inquiry,
which may be encouraging,

07:33.480 --> 07:35.400
but it would be inappropriate for us

07:35.400 --> 07:37.680
to reveal any further details
at this time.

07:37.680 --> 07:40.840
For operational reasons.
Isn't that the jargon?

07:43.240 --> 07:45.680
Does DS Drummond have
all the information

07:45.680 --> 07:47.800
you're prepared to share with us?

07:48.800 --> 07:50.320
Yes, he does.

07:50.320 --> 07:52.480
Then perhaps it would be
a better use of resources

07:52.480 --> 07:54.680
if you resume your investigation

07:54.680 --> 07:57.480
and Max stays here
to answer our questions.

08:00.760 --> 08:02.160
I'll see you later.

08:06.600 --> 08:09.200
The fragment of stone found
in the gash on Sophie's head?

08:09.200 --> 08:11.000
We're still waiting
on the lab report.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.040
Right.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.400
Can you guys chase
that up for me, please?

08:13.400 --> 08:15.200
Yeah, sure.
Cool.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.120
Fuck you.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.960
Fuck you for telling Sophie's mum
I'm not up for the job.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.400
I never told her.
No wonder she never
gave me a chance.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.440
You didn't want her to.
No, it's not like that.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.560
Being all buddy-buddy.
You want to be her go-to boy?
That's not true.

08:30.560 --> 08:33.000
Side-line me so that
you're her only point of contact?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.400
Stop. Stop.

08:34.400 --> 08:36.640
I had to step in to save your ass.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.920
Asking if her daughter
was a drug addict!

08:38.920 --> 08:40.360
I never said that.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.040
It's what she heard, Meg.

08:42.040 --> 08:44.360
But maybe if you had
an ounce of sensitivity...

08:44.360 --> 08:46.240
Handing out advice now, are you?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.920
Well, fuck you very much.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.040
Meg!

08:50.280 --> 08:52.680
My office. Now.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.560
DS Drummond,
if you'd care to join us.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.880
Not greatly.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.000
He told Abigail Crawford this is
my first case as lead detective.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.800
No, I didn't.
I did.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.120
Indirectly.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.800
She asked for your CV.

09:14.800 --> 09:16.280
Understandable, really.

09:16.280 --> 09:18.560
She wanted reassurance
you were competent.

09:18.560 --> 09:21.200
I told her I have every faith
in your ability.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.760
And, for what it's worth,
I told her the same thing.

09:23.760 --> 09:26.520
None of us like this situation,
but we're stuck in it.

09:26.520 --> 09:29.560
And you two are stuck with
each other.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.280
Meg, you will treat DS Drummond

09:32.280 --> 09:35.120
like he's a valued member
of the team.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.240
Which, of course, he is.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.640
And for your part, DS Drummond,

09:39.640 --> 09:41.280
I'm sure you wouldn't
want to do anything

09:41.280 --> 09:44.320
to undermine your
colleague's authority as lead.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.600
Your egos don't matter.

09:48.600 --> 09:50.960
This investigation does.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.960
So we're going to
learn to play nice.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.120
Aren't we?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.760
That's the spirit.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.240
Right...

10:05.240 --> 10:07.680
Where are we with tracking
down Erica Paton?

10:07.680 --> 10:09.120
Nowhere, boss.

10:09.120 --> 10:13.040
We've checked international flights,
flights and ferries to Tassie.

10:13.040 --> 10:15.440
Her parents haven't heard from her
and nor has her boyfriend.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.040
She hasn't used her credit card
and her mobile phone is off.

10:19.040 --> 10:21.040
Well, she can't stay
off the grid for long.

10:21.040 --> 10:23.280
$20,000 will buy you some time.

10:25.440 --> 10:27.520
It might help if Sophie's parents

10:27.520 --> 10:29.680
were to make an appeal
for more information.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.320
Could encourage someone
to come forward,

10:31.320 --> 10:33.120
filling her missing hours.

10:37.640 --> 10:39.960
Can't harm to ask.

10:39.960 --> 10:42.040
Then I'm sure you'll be happy to.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.036
Yes, sir.

10:54.540 --> 10:56.420
(GASPS) Oh, my God.
Hello!

10:56.420 --> 10:59.180
It's been forever.
18 months.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.020
I was just reading about you.

11:01.020 --> 11:02.500
Oh, your case.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.580
I don't suppose
you can talk about it, can you?

11:04.580 --> 11:08.540
It's all I talk about,
but, uh, no, I'm sorry.

11:08.540 --> 11:10.140
You're looking well.

11:10.140 --> 11:11.900
Those aren't prescription, then.

11:13.300 --> 11:18.500
Hi. A BLT
and an Energizer juice, please.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.860
I'll have what she is having.

11:23.940 --> 11:26.460
Clearly not a film buff.

11:26.460 --> 11:29.380
So how are you doing?
OK. Alright.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.940
Almost over the jet lag.

11:31.940 --> 11:34.140
Anna told me about the separation.

11:35.140 --> 11:37.860
The... Well, no,
I wouldn't call it that.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.420
Oh, she did.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.140
Well, not in so many words.

11:41.140 --> 11:43.260
More, actually.
You know how she goes on.

11:45.260 --> 11:47.940
Suppose all marriages
have their ups and downs.

11:47.940 --> 11:50.460
She described it as a trial.

11:50.460 --> 11:51.740
Our marriage?

11:51.740 --> 11:53.220
Your separation.

11:53.220 --> 11:56.540
She said something about
breakdown in communication.

11:56.540 --> 11:57.980
Oh, right.

11:57.980 --> 11:59.340
Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:59.340 --> 12:01.580
There must be,
because this is all news to me.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.620
How's your hotel?

12:04.620 --> 12:07.860
Grim. I've got water
leaking out my fridge.

12:07.860 --> 12:10.860
You have a fridge?
Well, there's nothing in it.

12:10.860 --> 12:14.180
There was a cockroach, but I think
he checked out in disgust.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.860
Come and stay with us.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.580
No, no, no, no, no.

12:17.580 --> 12:19.580
I wasn't fishing.
No, I know you weren't.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.620
I'd like you.
It'd be nice having someone around.

12:22.620 --> 12:25.420
What about Hamish?
He's my husband. He doesn't count.

12:25.420 --> 12:27.260
No, I mean...

12:27.260 --> 12:29.340
Won't he mind?
It might be for a few weeks.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.780
All the more reason.

12:30.780 --> 12:33.740
Besides, he's always at work.
He may not even notice you're there.

12:33.740 --> 12:36.340
If you're sure...
The boys will love it!

12:36.340 --> 12:38.460
They don't remember their uncle
and they're keen to meet you.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.340
Oh, that's just because
they want presents.

12:40.340 --> 12:42.740
They're nine and seven.

12:42.740 --> 12:45.100
Might need a bit more help
than that.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.700
Move in this evening.

12:46.700 --> 12:48.900
It's an easy commute,
Ferry across the harbour.

12:48.900 --> 12:51.460
Mmm. Beats the tube.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.460
Hands-down.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.780
I wish you'd reconsider.

12:55.780 --> 12:58.500
If you get too emotional,
the press will have a field day.

12:58.500 --> 13:01.060
Not emotional enough - same thing.

13:01.060 --> 13:03.940
There's just no upside to this
that I can see.

13:03.940 --> 13:06.940
Helping the police find out
what happened to Sophie.

13:09.900 --> 13:12.060
Thank you for agreeing to do this.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.020
Chief Inspector Newell
will introduce you,

13:14.020 --> 13:15.340
then you'll make your appeal.

13:15.340 --> 13:16.940
You're happy to take questions?

13:16.940 --> 13:18.620
No.
Yes.

13:18.620 --> 13:20.060
Yes.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.020
Then, if you're ready.

13:24.500 --> 13:27.620
Max, would you stay in my eyeline?

13:27.620 --> 13:29.820
I think it would help me.
Yeah, of course.

13:29.820 --> 13:31.980
(SHUTTERS CLICK)

13:38.260 --> 13:40.700
When did you last see your daughter?

13:40.700 --> 13:43.580
Um... You more recently than me.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.020
Yes.

13:45.020 --> 13:46.460
Um...

13:46.460 --> 13:48.420
About two weeks ago,
I was here on business,

13:48.420 --> 13:50.580
and I took Sophie out for dinner.

13:51.820 --> 13:53.340
She was so happy.

13:55.220 --> 13:57.260
Living near the beach at Manly.

13:57.260 --> 13:59.100
She had made
all these wonderful friends.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.180
She was in love.

14:03.180 --> 14:06.100
She had so much life
left in front of her. (SOBS)

14:11.500 --> 14:16.260
I last saw her a month ago,
in Singapore.

14:17.260 --> 14:20.100
She'd flown up to surprise me.

14:21.260 --> 14:23.340
She knew how happy it would make me.

14:25.340 --> 14:28.900
We wound up in my room...

14:30.780 --> 14:33.300
..raiding the mini bar
and ordering in.

14:36.460 --> 14:38.020
She...

14:39.660 --> 14:43.780
She saw buffalo wings on the menu,

14:43.780 --> 14:45.900
and she'd never heard of them.

14:45.900 --> 14:48.260
Wondered how buffaloes
could have wings.

14:48.260 --> 14:51.060
So that's what we ate.
(QUIET LAUGHTER)

14:51.060 --> 14:54.660
And then, um, we just talked.

14:57.780 --> 14:59.340
About nothing.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.340
Just a mum and her daughter

15:04.340 --> 15:06.780
catching up after too long apart.

15:14.980 --> 15:18.820
Of course, I had no idea that
I wouldn't see her again, so...

15:27.980 --> 15:31.300
There is something
I'd like to say, and...

15:32.460 --> 15:34.940
..I would like to
address this directly

15:34.940 --> 15:37.060
to Sophie's friends here in Sydney.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.100
If any of you feel like
you have information

15:41.100 --> 15:43.180
that could help the police

15:43.180 --> 15:45.780
that you haven't yet
shared with them,

15:45.780 --> 15:48.500
please, come forward.

15:50.260 --> 15:52.820
Whether you only knew Sophie
in passing...

15:52.820 --> 15:54.060
Lloyd, do you want me to...
Uh!

15:54.060 --> 15:56.260
..or you were her closest friend...

15:57.940 --> 16:02.420
..for our sake, please, get in touch.

16:04.060 --> 16:05.780
Thank you.

16:05.780 --> 16:07.420

16:14.900 --> 16:16.900
Were you watching it?
What?

16:16.900 --> 16:18.900
I need you at home tonight,
with Oscar.

16:18.900 --> 16:20.060
I can't tonight, Dad.

16:20.060 --> 16:22.540
7 o'clock. Don't be late.

16:46.180 --> 16:47.540
What do you say, boys?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.700
Thank you, Uncle Max.
Thank you, Uncle Max.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.220
Um... Maybe just Max.

16:51.220 --> 16:52.980
Can I play with it now?

16:52.980 --> 16:56.180
OK. But, later, you do
20 minutes practice, alright?

16:57.780 --> 16:59.820
A big hit.
Oh!

16:59.820 --> 17:01.740
We know who
takes the credit for that.

17:01.740 --> 17:03.140
I'll show you your room.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.500
You hit hard.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.220
For a chick?

17:24.220 --> 17:26.620
For anyone your size.

17:26.620 --> 17:29.460
You're new here. What's your name?

17:29.460 --> 17:30.700
Hamed.

17:30.700 --> 17:33.220
Well, Hamed, I'm sure
I'll be getting to know you,

17:33.220 --> 17:34.900
you being a mate of Benny's.

17:34.900 --> 17:36.340
(MEN LAUGH)

17:38.500 --> 17:40.100

Leave a message.

17:49.980 --> 17:51.460
(BEEP!)

17:51.460 --> 17:54.660
Hi, it's me.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.060
I'm staying with Tori and Hamish.

17:59.660 --> 18:01.500
Look, um...

18:01.500 --> 18:03.540
I'm going to give you some space.

18:04.860 --> 18:07.180
When you're ready to talk,
just call me.

18:10.060 --> 18:11.140
I love you.

18:15.540 --> 18:20.660
..for our sake, please,
please get in touch.

18:23.220 --> 18:25.220
Is this something
we need to be worried about?

18:25.220 --> 18:27.140
Nup. Nup.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.620
Don't shit a shitter, boys.

18:28.620 --> 18:30.620
If there's anything
you haven't told me...

18:32.060 --> 18:33.700
No, there isn't. We're sweet.

18:33.700 --> 18:35.260
What about Erica?

18:35.260 --> 18:37.260
This appeal is clearly aimed at her.

18:37.260 --> 18:39.740
She's gone to ground.
I can't even get a hold of her.

18:39.740 --> 18:41.420
Well, maybe tell the police that.

18:41.420 --> 18:45.060
You know, show some concern,
being her boyfriend and all.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.512
Hi. Um...

18:57.512 --> 19:00.592
I was here the other day
about Sophie Chalcott.

19:01.592 --> 19:05.432
Um... I've got more to say.

19:05.432 --> 19:08.512
I saw Sophie's mum on TV.
It was so sad.

19:08.512 --> 19:11.832
And I was like,
maybe I should tell you.

19:11.832 --> 19:14.032
There were drugs on the party boat.

19:14.032 --> 19:16.272
I wasn't doing any,
but my friends were.

19:16.272 --> 19:18.712
They got them from Sophie and Erica.

19:18.712 --> 19:21.392
You're saying Sophie and Erica
were dealing drugs?

19:21.392 --> 19:22.992
Not dealing, no.

19:22.992 --> 19:25.192
But, like, selling them.

19:26.512 --> 19:29.312
Everyone knew if you wanted drugs,
you went to Sophie or Erica.

19:30.432 --> 19:32.592
But, like, not me. I didn't.

19:35.992 --> 19:38.432
You be safe, eh?
Take care of yourself.

19:40.312 --> 19:41.632
Oscar, hi!

19:41.632 --> 19:44.032
Hey, Oscar.
Hi.

19:46.992 --> 19:48.712
Just in here, mate.

19:48.712 --> 19:50.592
Take a seat, thanks, Oscar.

19:52.832 --> 19:54.512
Mind if I record this, mate?

19:54.512 --> 19:56.032
Uh, yeah.

19:56.032 --> 19:57.952
I don't have anything new.

19:57.952 --> 20:01.072
I just haven't heard from Erica,
and I'm really beginning to worry.

20:01.072 --> 20:04.192
We've had a good response
to Sophie's parents' appeal.

20:04.192 --> 20:06.392
One thing it's thrown up
is the suggestion that

20:06.392 --> 20:08.832
Erica and Sophie were dealing drugs.

20:08.832 --> 20:12.072
What? No. God, no.

20:12.072 --> 20:14.312
You never saw them selling drugs
to their friends?

20:14.312 --> 20:15.472
No.

20:20.792 --> 20:23.272
OK. Maybe a few pills.

20:23.272 --> 20:25.992
But they weren't drug dealers.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.832
Where did they get them from?

20:27.832 --> 20:29.592
I don't know.
Really?

20:29.592 --> 20:32.312
Look, I just came here to see if
you've heard from her, alright?

20:32.312 --> 20:34.232
I'm worried.

20:34.232 --> 20:36.072
Did they ever sell you drugs?

20:41.992 --> 20:44.872
Erica works at a bar in Manly.

20:44.872 --> 20:47.912
I THINK there's a guy there
that she gets them from.

20:49.512 --> 20:51.152
OK.

20:51.152 --> 20:53.552
Because a moment ago,
you said you didn't know.

20:54.552 --> 20:57.952
Does this guy have a name?
Yeah, he must have. I don't know it.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.432
Description.
I never met him.

21:00.432 --> 21:02.712
I just know he gives her
a few pills to give to her friends,

21:02.712 --> 21:04.112
you know, like...

21:04.112 --> 21:06.432
Not a lot, not an indictable amount.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.392
You know what indictable amount is?

21:11.632 --> 21:14.672
What can you tell us about
the break-in at Erica's unit?

21:16.032 --> 21:17.592
Um, me?

21:17.592 --> 21:19.352
Nothing.

21:19.352 --> 21:20.872
But, clearly, you know about it.

21:20.872 --> 21:23.272
Erica did say something.
Kids, she thought.

21:23.272 --> 21:25.792
And they didn't think
to report it to the police?

21:25.792 --> 21:28.272
I don't think they saw the point.
There wasn't much taken.

21:28.272 --> 21:31.232
Sophie thought she might have
even left the door unlocked.

21:33.032 --> 21:35.592
How'd you get
those scratches on your head?

21:35.592 --> 21:36.992
Gardening.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.672
Seem pretty sure about that.
Didn't even have to think.

21:40.672 --> 21:42.392
Well, yeah, it's my job.

21:42.392 --> 21:44.232
I'm a gardener.

21:44.232 --> 21:45.432
Great.

21:45.432 --> 21:48.912
Well, if we have any news
about Erica, we'll let you know.

21:48.912 --> 21:51.552
And if you hear from her, you
tell her to give us a call, yeah?

21:54.392 --> 21:55.912
Sure.

21:55.912 --> 21:59.512
Do you think Oscar...
Supplied the drugs to the girls?

21:59.512 --> 22:02.472
He knows more about that break-in
than he's letting on.

22:02.472 --> 22:04.632
That could be related to the drugs.

22:04.632 --> 22:07.152
But is it related to Sophie's murder?

22:07.152 --> 22:10.952
Sarge, I've tracked
the 20K from Sophie's account.

22:10.952 --> 22:13.632
Let me guess.
Number of small cash deposits.

22:13.632 --> 22:16.312
A single cheque, paid last month,

22:16.312 --> 22:18.232
from a firm called
Think Big Unlimited.

22:18.232 --> 22:19.952
Who the hell are they?

22:19.952 --> 22:23.552
Their directors are
Justin and Mary Makepeace.

22:23.552 --> 22:25.632
Makepeace?

22:25.632 --> 22:27.712
I know that name.

22:27.712 --> 22:30.672
He's the chief of staff
to the leader of the Labor Party.

22:33.592 --> 22:36.712
No, bugger 'em. Six IS my last offer.

22:36.712 --> 22:40.312
Well, it's not.
But tell them that. They might blink.

22:40.312 --> 22:42.632
Sor... Got to go. Simon.

22:42.632 --> 22:45.072
Come in. Good to see you.
Geri, coffees, please.

22:45.072 --> 22:46.552
Thanks, Geri.

22:48.352 --> 22:51.432
I wanted to bring you up to speed
on the sale of Winston Station.

22:51.432 --> 22:52.872
Oh, Simon, bugger that -

22:52.872 --> 22:56.312
in the greater scheme of things,
couldn't be less important.

22:56.312 --> 23:00.672
Well, the South Americans
have upped their bid by $15 million.

23:00.672 --> 23:02.312
15 million?

23:02.312 --> 23:04.712
Contingent on market projections,
of course, but...

23:07.192 --> 23:09.672
You know, I don't even know
if this is appropriate,

23:09.672 --> 23:12.392
I have no idea how you and Abigail
are even coping,

23:12.392 --> 23:14.352
but...

23:14.352 --> 23:16.312
..if you two need
a break from room service,

23:16.312 --> 23:18.872
I would love to invite you
to my place for a barbie.

23:20.032 --> 23:23.272
That'd be great.
I'd really appreciate that, Lloyd.

23:23.272 --> 23:24.872
Abigail would, too.

23:32.192 --> 23:33.752
I guess if you're feeling up to it,

23:33.752 --> 23:35.752
we could review where we're at
with Winston Station.

23:35.752 --> 23:37.192
Yeah.
Yeah.

23:39.912 --> 23:42.992
(INDISTINCT CHATTER, PHONES RING)

23:52.152 --> 23:54.472
DS Driscoll, DS Drummond,
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

23:54.472 --> 23:56.512
No. Thank you for seeing us
at no notice.

23:56.512 --> 23:58.832
Well, you made it sound important.

23:58.832 --> 24:00.552
It is.

24:00.552 --> 24:03.392
Why do you spell 'labour'
without 'u'?

24:03.392 --> 24:04.592
What?

24:04.592 --> 24:07.112
No, just...
You spell labour the American way.

24:07.112 --> 24:09.032
Is that what you
wanted to see me about?

24:10.552 --> 24:12.272
Let's go to my office.

24:13.512 --> 24:16.432
Oh, hello, Mr Hardy.

24:16.432 --> 24:18.352
DS Max Drummond from London.

24:18.352 --> 24:20.872
We met at the airport.
With Abigail. Yes.

24:20.872 --> 24:21.952
What brings you here?

24:21.952 --> 24:24.192
Just a few questions
for your chief of staff.

24:24.192 --> 24:25.872
Is that something
I should sit in on?

24:27.152 --> 24:29.032
Well, it was nice meeting you again.

24:29.032 --> 24:30.272
And you.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.840
How to get our message across
to young people.

24:47.840 --> 24:51.120
They're known for being
disenchanted with politics.

24:51.120 --> 24:53.400
Don't you have companies
to do that for you?

24:53.400 --> 24:57.080
We thought that Sophie would provide
a fresh perspective,

24:57.080 --> 24:59.200
as a member of that demographic,

24:59.200 --> 25:01.440
but also as an outsider.

25:01.440 --> 25:03.520
Can we see it, this research?

25:03.520 --> 25:06.000
Sure, sure. Yeah. Um...

25:06.000 --> 25:07.800
It might take me a little while
to find it.

25:07.800 --> 25:08.920
(DOOR OPENS)

25:08.920 --> 25:11.800
Everything alright in here, Justin?
Yes, Greg.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.640
It's nothing you need to
concern yourself with.

25:13.640 --> 25:16.840
We were just asking a few questions
about Sophie Chalcott.

25:16.840 --> 25:19.160
If Sophie did this work
for the party,

25:19.160 --> 25:21.560
why was she paid
by a consulting firm?

25:21.560 --> 25:24.720
That might be an issue for
the Australian Electoral Commission.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.560
What's this about?
It's nothing, Greg, really.

25:27.560 --> 25:33.360
Mr Makepeace paid Sophie Chilcott
$20,000 shortly before she died.

25:33.360 --> 25:35.480
He said it was for research.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.760
Sophie Chalcott was my daughter.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.920
Or, so she'd recently
revealed to me. I'd had no idea.

25:48.920 --> 25:51.000
It was a revelation that...

25:51.000 --> 25:53.000
..should that come out
during an electoral campaign,

25:53.000 --> 25:54.640
could be a serious embarrassment.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.280
Family values politician
caught cheating on his wife.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.120
Even if it were 20 years ago.

26:00.120 --> 26:02.080
And what about the money?

26:02.080 --> 26:05.880
It was for her to piss off abroad
until after the election.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.560
Except the little bitch didn't.

26:12.080 --> 26:15.960
Where were you on the night
Sophie Chalcott died, Mr Makepeace?

26:15.960 --> 26:18.600
You can't think that
I had anything to do with this.

26:20.600 --> 26:22.560
Remind me of the date.

26:22.560 --> 26:23.840
The 28th.

26:23.840 --> 26:26.880
(SIGHS, CLEARS THROAT) OK.

26:26.880 --> 26:30.560
You had dinner with the
Sino-Australian Friendship Alliance.

26:30.560 --> 26:31.880
You weren't there.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.440
I don't like Chinese food.

26:35.440 --> 26:38.080
I stayed at the office
and worked late.

26:38.080 --> 26:39.240
Um...

26:39.240 --> 26:41.440
If I remember,
I left around midnight.

26:41.440 --> 26:43.160
Can anyone verify that?

26:43.160 --> 26:45.560
No, I was...
I was working by myself.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.440
Still, there's bound to be
security footage we could check.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.400
Uh, no, hang on.

26:51.400 --> 26:53.880
Sorry. I'm getting my days mixed up.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.520
The 28th? Um...

26:56.520 --> 26:59.960
Yeah. I left around seven and...

26:59.960 --> 27:01.400
..and went home.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.040
I don't often get a chance
to put the kids to bed.

27:04.040 --> 27:06.760
So your wife should be able to
vouch for you.

27:09.280 --> 27:10.720
Shit.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.800
(WHISPERS) Shit...

27:13.800 --> 27:16.480
I was, uh...

27:16.480 --> 27:18.120
..meeting someone.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.520
Can she provide you with an alibi?

27:26.120 --> 27:28.000
It's a he.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.720
You know?
No, but there's been gossip.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.680
Justin, I don't care.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.240
No. My wife would.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.160
She doesn't need to
know about any of this.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.360
Does she?

27:40.360 --> 27:42.120
That's not our concern, sir.

27:42.120 --> 27:44.160
But we do need to
speak with this man.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.320
He's married too.

27:47.320 --> 27:50.120
We'll go to his place of work.
That would be even worse.

27:50.120 --> 27:52.800
He's a... He's a teacher
at a Christian school.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.920
Yeah, but in Australia,

27:54.920 --> 27:57.080
you can't be fired
for being gay, can you?

27:57.080 --> 27:59.240
No, but religious schools
can dismiss teachers

27:59.240 --> 28:01.640
if their behaviour isn't
in keeping with their faith.

28:01.640 --> 28:03.760
Oh, so, like, if you're gay.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.360
Right.

28:05.360 --> 28:08.320
We can do this in a way
that no one will know.

28:08.320 --> 28:10.960
But you do need to give us his name.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.040
(SIZZLING)

28:24.040 --> 28:25.960
Nice and fine.

28:25.960 --> 28:28.320
When Simon said
you'd invited us for a meal, Lloyd,

28:28.320 --> 28:29.880
I assumed you'd have it catered.

28:29.880 --> 28:32.440
After you've tasted this,
you might wish I had.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.040
Hmm, no.

28:34.040 --> 28:36.320
You clearly know one end
of a sausage from another.

28:36.320 --> 28:39.000
Well, here we call them snags.

28:39.000 --> 28:43.160
And the beef comes from my cattle
and the lamb from my sheep.

28:43.160 --> 28:45.040
It's the station
I'm selling for Lloyd.

28:45.040 --> 28:46.560
Yeah, all things going well,

28:46.560 --> 28:49.160
you might have
a bigger hand in that than Simon.

28:49.160 --> 28:50.600
Me?
Mmm.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.240
The trade deal you're negotiate,

28:52.240 --> 28:54.840
it's a big opportunity
for Aussie farmers.

28:54.840 --> 28:57.600
Or it could be,
if you drop your demand that

28:57.600 --> 29:01.000
British standards of food production
become the norm.

29:01.000 --> 29:03.960
You mean lower our standards
to your level,

29:03.960 --> 29:06.360
allowing meat
pumped full of hormones.

29:06.360 --> 29:08.560
British consumers expect better.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.520
Tell me, is that cooked enough?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.200
It's delicious.

29:18.200 --> 29:20.880
Can't taste the hormones
coursing through it?

29:23.440 --> 29:25.680
Come on, let's eat.

29:26.760 --> 29:30.040
Start with a sausage each, lamb.

29:31.360 --> 29:35.000
So how close are we to a deal?

29:35.000 --> 29:38.080
Close, but this issue divides us.

29:38.080 --> 29:41.200
And at the moment,
neither side will budge.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.480
Surely the Brits won't jeopardise
the whole deal because of this.

29:44.480 --> 29:45.840
That would be madness.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.400
I'll bear that assessment in mind.

29:49.920 --> 29:51.560
Enough shoptalk.

29:51.560 --> 29:53.480
You're here to relax, so, please.

29:54.760 --> 29:58.160
To be honest,
work is a welcome distraction.

29:59.640 --> 30:02.040
Not wishing to pry,
but I can't help wondering -

30:02.040 --> 30:04.480
have the police made any progress.

30:04.480 --> 30:07.840
The police have set their sights
on Sophie's flatmate, Erica.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.360
Do you know her at all?
Oh, I've met her. I'm not keen. Son!

30:11.360 --> 30:13.040
You joining us?

30:13.040 --> 30:14.440
No, I got to go meet Os.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.360
Yeah, well, we were just
talking about Oscar's girlfriend.

30:17.360 --> 30:19.360
The police seem to have been
taking an interest in her.

30:19.360 --> 30:20.760
Any idea why?

30:20.760 --> 30:23.040
Well, she has disappeared.

30:23.040 --> 30:25.600
Oscar reckons she got
mixed up in drugs,

30:25.600 --> 30:28.360
but he's told the police
everything he knows.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.760
OK. Alright.

30:35.480 --> 30:37.080
Is he alright?

30:38.080 --> 30:41.120
No, he's taking
the whole thing very badly.

30:41.120 --> 30:45.680
Do you think drugs had something
to do with Sophie's death?

30:45.680 --> 30:48.720
There's got to be a reason
they're looking at Erica.

can show Daddy when he comes home.

Yeah. Until I discovered girls,
and then I gave it up.

31:23.292 --> 31:27.812
Which was a big mistake,
because girls love a musician.

its name was Stanley.

So?

32:37.132 --> 32:39.852
So why would he call Stanley

for murder.

his victim, you know, right?

36:58.892 --> 37:01.572
Is there somewhere that
I could...throw up?

37:01.572 --> 37:03.692
Oh! This way.

37:05.172 --> 37:07.252
Good heavens.
I hope she's going to be alright.

37:07.252 --> 37:09.572
Yeah, she'll be fine.

37:09.572 --> 37:13.052
Right, sir, don't be alarmed,
but we're detectives,

37:13.052 --> 37:16.092
Here to speak to you about your
relationship with Justin Makepeace.

37:16.092 --> 37:17.172
Who?

37:21.772 --> 37:24.012
The man you meet for sex.

37:25.012 --> 37:26.532
Oh, dear God.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.092
When did you last see him?

37:31.412 --> 37:33.932
(EXHALES) Um...

37:33.932 --> 37:35.332
About a week ago.

37:35.332 --> 37:37.572
The Friday.
The 28th?

37:37.572 --> 37:39.372
Yeah.

37:44.332 --> 37:45.772
All good?

37:45.772 --> 37:47.332
Yeah. Thank you.

37:47.332 --> 37:49.172
We won't take up
any more of your time.

37:53.572 --> 37:55.452
What was that all about?

37:55.452 --> 37:58.892
I don't know.
He just made his excuses and left.

37:59.932 --> 38:02.252
I think he knew
they couldn't afford it.

38:02.252 --> 38:04.532
I mean, did you see her clothes?

38:04.532 --> 38:05.652
Yeah. (LAUGHS)

38:16.552 --> 38:19.992
TORI: Yeah. Fine. OK. Bye.

38:22.512 --> 38:25.072
Hamish has had to fly to Melbourne
for a meeting.

38:26.432 --> 38:30.752
Does he go away for work a lot?
Every opportunity, I sometimes think.

38:30.752 --> 38:33.792
I'm ready for my story.

38:33.792 --> 38:35.632
Daddy won't be home tonight.

38:35.632 --> 38:37.512
I'll read you a bedtime story.

38:37.512 --> 38:39.512
Can Max?

38:39.512 --> 38:41.912
Sure.
Yes!

38:43.192 --> 38:45.072
You're the father they've never had.

38:45.072 --> 38:46.912
It's easy when you're their uncle.

38:46.912 --> 38:49.632
Why don't you want children?
Whoa!

38:49.632 --> 38:51.232
Who says I don't?

38:52.432 --> 38:55.432
Well, Anna, obviously.
I never said that.

38:55.432 --> 38:56.952
So you do?

38:56.952 --> 38:59.192
(SIGHS)

38:59.192 --> 39:02.392
If I do something,
I have to do it well.

39:02.392 --> 39:06.552
And I'm just not sure
I could be a good father.

39:07.552 --> 39:10.632
When I'm on a case, I give it 100%.

39:10.632 --> 39:13.792
Sort of takes me over.
Anna knows that.

39:15.032 --> 39:17.392
And...if I had kids,

39:17.392 --> 39:20.832
I wouldn't want to be
distracted or absent,

39:20.832 --> 39:22.632
and I would be.

39:23.992 --> 39:27.472
I couldn't promise to be at
the football match or speech day.

39:28.952 --> 39:30.472
But even birth.

39:35.352 --> 39:36.952
I'd hate to be that dad.

39:38.272 --> 39:39.832
The fact you're even
thinking about it

39:39.832 --> 39:41.792
means you'd make a better dad
than some.

39:45.032 --> 39:47.432
The Prime Minister
has developed a reputation

39:47.432 --> 39:50.712
for saying one thing one day,
then claiming it meant something.

39:50.712 --> 39:52.352
Please, Simon, turn that off.

39:52.352 --> 39:55.192
Stanley-gate is being seen
as just the latest example.

39:55.192 --> 39:56.712
For the moment...

39:56.712 --> 39:59.832
Some reporters tracked down
Stanley's vet,

39:59.832 --> 40:02.992
who confirms that
she was, indeed, a bitch.

40:04.032 --> 40:06.272
PM's off the hook, then.

40:06.272 --> 40:09.192
Pundits are saying the damage
has already been done.

40:14.472 --> 40:18.392
Ben tells me that...
if the PM does go...

40:19.752 --> 40:22.672
..I may be one of the contenders
to replace him.

40:24.752 --> 40:27.992
It's not your fault this has
presented you with an opportunity.

40:27.992 --> 40:30.112
Yes, but...

40:30.112 --> 40:32.752
..should I be prepared to
capitalise on it?

40:35.792 --> 40:37.432
And the truth is...

40:39.272 --> 40:40.672
..I am.

40:42.552 --> 40:44.232
Eager, even.

40:45.632 --> 40:47.832
That's terrible, isn't it?

40:49.672 --> 40:52.152
Our goal has always been Number 10.

40:54.752 --> 40:57.672
Perhaps some good
will yet come out of all this.

41:04.552 --> 41:06.912
(CALL ALERT)

41:21.392 --> 41:22.632
Hello.

41:25.672 --> 41:27.072
Who is this?

41:30.352 --> 41:33.032
(ON PHONE) This is Anna.
Leave a message.

41:33.032 --> 41:34.632
(BEEP!)

41:34.632 --> 41:35.952
Hey.

41:37.272 --> 41:39.272
Listen,

41:39.272 --> 41:41.592
I know I said I wouldn't call,

41:41.592 --> 41:43.632
but I lied.

41:43.632 --> 41:45.112
Alright?

41:47.712 --> 41:49.352
Please call me.

42:02.992 --> 42:04.672
(DING!)

42:21.992 --> 42:23.432
You look hot.

42:23.432 --> 42:25.112
Thought I might wear it
to the blow-up pool.

42:25.112 --> 42:26.832
Hell, yeah!

42:26.832 --> 42:29.392
Oh, sorry.

42:29.392 --> 42:30.992
PM sends his regards.

42:30.992 --> 42:32.712
He wants me to stay on in Australia.

42:32.712 --> 42:33.912
He wants you out of the way.

42:33.912 --> 42:36.272
She's playing you.
Abigail?

42:36.272 --> 42:37.592
She thinks you're in her pocket.

42:37.592 --> 42:40.272
We know that Greg Hardy is
Sophie's biological father.

42:40.272 --> 42:43.592
It's not relevant.
It is up to the police to
determine what's relevant.

42:43.592 --> 42:45.392
I was in love with you.

42:45.392 --> 42:46.992
I still am.

42:46.992 --> 42:49.952
The police don't seem to know
what it is they have,

42:49.952 --> 42:51.752
but I need you to
talk to your girlfriend.

42:51.752 --> 42:53.232
She's not answering my calls.

42:53.232 --> 42:54.752
I don't give a rat's ass!

42:54.752 --> 42:57.672
Lloyd Macklin, local boy made good.

43:01.072 --> 43:04.072
