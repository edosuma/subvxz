00:06.210 --> 00:10.178
We heard he has some powerful
friends with links to the mafia.

00:10.278 --> 00:12.410
Is this true? Does it worry you?

00:12.844 --> 00:14.979
Look, he is doing great
things for the town.

00:15.079 --> 00:19.411
Personally, I think that nowadays
politicians should be strong men,

00:19.511 --> 00:25.846
from the street, a little bit like the mafia, you
know. Otherwise they can't fight against the mafia.

00:29.747 --> 00:35.514
I like him because he speaks from the heart
and he is not trying to be politically correct.

00:35.615 --> 00:37.448
- So you trust him?
- Yes

00:55.484 --> 00:58.286
Sir, may I ask you a question?

00:58.385 --> 01:00.019
It's Are you familiar with...

01:20.488 --> 01:22.623
I own a lot of things.

01:22.723 --> 01:23.756
Like?

01:24.422 --> 01:26.689
Like hotels, clubs.

01:26.789 --> 01:29.091
So the club we are going
to tonight is your club?

01:29.191 --> 01:30.390
Of course, it's mine!

01:30.757 --> 01:35.158
- And the hotel we are staying...
- Hotel we are staying is mine.

01:35.259 --> 01:36.925
Some people are mine.

01:37.458 --> 01:39.726
Here some of the people are mine.

01:45.860 --> 01:51.995
There's obviously, you know, obviously the script that
we've preapproved, so we'll be going through all of that.

01:52.095 --> 01:54.028
Make sure he'll film everything.

01:54.128 --> 01:59.329
Just make sure the camera is working
and he is stable with his hands.

01:59.428 --> 02:01.762
- Yeah, yeah, he is filming everything.
- This is very important!

02:01.862 --> 02:06.364
Forget about the script, forget
about those bullshit things.

02:06.663 --> 02:10.697
Very important is to shoot, to film.

02:11.564 --> 02:13.265
Everything to be...

02:13.864 --> 02:17.431
No worries, no worries
, I'm a professional.

02:17.865 --> 02:20.531
- I hope so.
- And this is a very safe car.

02:20.632 --> 02:23.532
Very good car. This is my donkey, you know.

02:25.267 --> 02:26.599
Look.

02:31.433 --> 02:34.701
What? Can you? Excuse me...

02:44.569 --> 02:46.703
- Some fresh air, huh?
- Yeah.

02:46.803 --> 02:47.904
Good!

02:51.205 --> 02:53.571
Now you feel better?

02:54.571 --> 02:57.438
We are going to the factory now, right?

03:01.039 --> 03:02.773
Not right now.

03:03.873 --> 03:05.873
Right now first...

03:08.040 --> 03:10.041
some beautiful views.

03:10.574 --> 03:14.407
This night we are going to
a night club. Night club.

03:14.507 --> 03:17.342
- I think there's a train coming.
- No worries.

03:17.441 --> 03:19.009
It'll wait!

03:19.675 --> 03:21.910
Everybody in this town knows me.

03:22.210 --> 03:23.943
Knows my car, knows me.

03:24.243 --> 03:28.177
So when I'm passing this
fucking railway they wait.

03:28.278 --> 03:29.977
- The whole train waits.
- Right.

03:30.077 --> 03:35.112
If I want, people come down, I'm checking
the tickets, and then they'll come up.

03:35.212 --> 03:36.178
If I want.

03:36.279 --> 03:38.012
Are you hungry?

03:38.846 --> 03:40.146
I could eat.

03:40.913 --> 03:41.979
You can eat what?

03:42.079 --> 03:43.079
Pills?

03:43.380 --> 03:46.381
Ah? Soundman.

03:46.480 --> 03:49.047
You can eat pills?

03:57.182 --> 04:00.548
- That's it.
- OK.

04:18.952 --> 04:21.753
My first business.

04:21.853 --> 04:24.020
I started small.

04:25.353 --> 04:30.954
I was a typical local entrepreneur.

04:36.355 --> 04:37.688
That's it.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.089
- Wow!
- Yeah.

04:44.690 --> 04:49.024
You like to get high
and eat a chocolate bar?

04:49.124 --> 04:55.158
But do you realise just how much
work is involved in this process?

04:55.258 --> 04:56.591
No, of course not.

04:56.825 --> 05:02.960
First step in this process is
baking and winnowing the cocoa.

05:03.193 --> 05:05.626
Then this is the grinder.

05:05.726 --> 05:09.061
Hey, soundman, don't put your dick in here.

05:09.361 --> 05:15.662
This grinder turns the cocoa
nibs into a liquid cocoa liquor.

05:16.528 --> 05:25.930
Then these people over there, they
add the butter, the sugar and the milk.

05:29.664 --> 05:34.399
My trading company imports
the milk and the sugar.

05:34.765 --> 05:41.799
Tonnes and tonnes. And if we
don't need it, we just sell it on.

05:42.899 --> 05:48.833
Here are the next steps in the process
- they are moulding and blending.

05:48.934 --> 05:51.834
You can mould chocolate
in whatever shape you want.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.801
Like, in your mom's shape, for example.

05:54.901 --> 05:56.001
Then...

05:57.336 --> 06:00.869
up and down the conveyor belt.

06:01.169 --> 06:03.137
Wrap the bars in foil.

06:03.237 --> 06:06.970
Load them on the trucks and that's it.

06:07.337 --> 06:09.437
Invoices are issued.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.671
VAT is repaid.

06:12.171 --> 06:13.871
Everyone is happy.

06:14.371 --> 06:16.471
You want to know about the fraud, huh?

06:16.571 --> 06:17.972
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:19.005 --> 06:20.072
OK.

06:20.471 --> 06:22.472
I will tell you.

06:22.906 --> 06:24.639
The accountants,

06:24.940 --> 06:26.173
the auditors,

06:26.506 --> 06:29.840
the people who are meant to
check on the businesses...

06:29.941 --> 06:31.640
They are monkeys.

06:33.875 --> 06:39.809
So if your payment receipts, invoices,

06:39.909 --> 06:42.209
expense reports, financial statements...

06:42.310 --> 06:46.311
If your paperwork is 100% precise.

06:46.411 --> 06:48.777
Not correct. Precise!

06:48.877 --> 06:56.545
That means your balance
sheet actually balances.

06:57.413 --> 07:02.846
Then the office monkeys are satisfied.

07:02.947 --> 07:06.980
The boxes are ticked, everyone is happy.

07:07.347 --> 07:09.580
The system works like this.

07:09.681 --> 07:17.615
Today I don't have to think
how to defraud the government.

07:18.382 --> 07:25.083
Nowadays the victims provide full
support in order to get defrauded.

07:25.783 --> 07:33.018
They come up with all kinds
of ridiculous excuses why

07:33.118 --> 07:37.885
their institution has
gifted me public money.

07:38.819 --> 07:43.719
I don't have to answer stupid
questions any more, you know.

07:43.819 --> 07:46.287
I work on a different scale now.

07:46.387 --> 07:51.322
You will see me. Very soon. One week.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.921
Don't touch it, please!

07:54.021 --> 07:55.487
I will open for you.

07:55.754 --> 08:00.655
Because I'm keeping this is
like a very sacred place for me.

08:01.323 --> 08:04.723
And here, you know what this is?

08:05.723 --> 08:09.091
This is for opening ceremonies.

08:09.358 --> 08:14.992
Yes. The peasants see me cutting ribbons
with this and they wet themselves.

08:15.326 --> 08:18.825
Because for them I'm like a Jesus.

08:19.092 --> 08:20.125
Jesus.

08:20.659 --> 08:25.626
Come, shoot inside. Just for fun, for joke.

08:25.926 --> 08:28.127
One, two, three. That was it.

08:28.428 --> 08:31.394
I'll show you better things, come on.

08:31.493 --> 08:34.128
- Are these real?
- Of course.

08:34.429 --> 08:38.195
These are real but dead animals.

08:38.696 --> 08:40.828
And this bear here...

08:41.129 --> 08:46.463
In the winter it was hibernating
and we there with Tanko and kill it.

08:46.563 --> 08:51.231
And this is my alive animal
- Tanko.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.165
He is a karate champion, you know.

08:58.532 --> 09:00.598
31 gold medals.

09:00.865 --> 09:04.267
We didn't count silver, bronze, no.

09:04.367 --> 09:05.666
- You don't deal with that.
- No.

09:05.766 --> 09:07.566
- Just gold.
- Only gold.

09:07.833 --> 09:09.767
And now he is a bodyguard.

09:09.867 --> 09:12.234
And he thinks he will be
the next Prime Minister.

09:12.335 --> 09:16.135
Come. Something very interesting here.

09:16.235 --> 09:18.668
- Do you know what it is?
- It's an icon?

09:18.768 --> 09:24.703
No, it's an antique. It's a
XIV century antique. For real.

09:24.803 --> 09:30.104
And it's taken from one very old
monastery. I mean, like a present.

09:30.204 --> 09:37.805
It's a present from the Gambling
Commission. So it's very sacred for me.

09:37.905 --> 09:46.040
I sit here. Sometimes I sit on
the bear. take it here and I pray.

09:46.506 --> 09:49.673
Lord Jesus it is you
who wakes me up every day

09:49.773 --> 09:52.574
and I'm forever grateful for your love.

09:52.674 --> 09:53.975
And this is why I pray.

09:54.541 --> 10:00.709
So I pray for the goodness of people,
for my goodness. I'm... Look here.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.676
I have. I am very I'm hard believer.

10:03.776 --> 10:04.843
Religious man.

10:04.943 --> 10:08.378
Very religious. And Tanko also. You, you...

10:08.477 --> 10:09.844
And we pray.

10:09.944 --> 10:12.477
Tell them. At Easter we go
and we walk around everything.

10:13.178 --> 10:15.545
We take fire from the church,

10:15.645 --> 10:19.312
we go in our homes, we
make good atmosphere,

10:19.412 --> 10:22.679
we drink whiskey, things like that.

10:22.779 --> 10:24.046
Cigars.

10:24.579 --> 10:27.847
We like good life.

10:31.914 --> 10:32.648
This is...

10:32.748 --> 10:35.182
You have a bust? Of you?

10:35.282 --> 10:37.614
I have an Italian sculptor friend

10:37.715 --> 10:42.016
and he made me a discount
because I have no hands.

10:42.116 --> 10:47.217
You see? No hands. I said "Hey,
idiot, where are my hands?"

10:47.317 --> 10:50.017
And he said "You are like this".

10:50.117 --> 10:53.617
So Tanko went and beat him up a little bit.

14:40.089 --> 14:47.590
Isn't it funny that of all of
the old bandits in your bank,

14:47.857 --> 14:52.225
they decided to send you here.

14:53.425 --> 14:54.991
I was available.

14:55.258 --> 15:01.126
Bullshit. Everyone was available,
but they shat their pants.

15:01.226 --> 15:03.793
Only you said "OK",

15:03.893 --> 15:07.427
and you took the dirty job like a real man,

15:07.526 --> 15:09.261
and I respect this.

15:09.594 --> 15:10.961
Hey, everybody.

15:11.061 --> 15:15.295
Take a moment to show respect
to this young professional.

15:15.595 --> 15:17.029
Because he went to school,

15:17.129 --> 15:20.130
he went to university, he
applied for a job, he made a CV,

15:20.230 --> 15:21.729
he went for team drinks.

15:21.829 --> 15:25.263
And that's a commitment
to do the right thing.

15:25.662 --> 15:27.663
And look at his face.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.464
He could have easily become a model.

15:30.764 --> 15:33.931
Eating from the nose, posing all day.

15:34.032 --> 15:38.099
Don't laugh, it's a good
life, very good life.

15:38.500 --> 15:39.799
Listen now.

15:40.299 --> 15:47.300
I talked last time with
your boss about the haircut

15:47.833 --> 15:52.734
and about paying back in equity,

15:52.968 --> 15:59.002
which is very sensible and very
reasonable, but he somehow doesn't get it.

16:17.605 --> 16:19.072
Do you understand?

16:19.172 --> 16:24.572
Tomorrow I want you to go straight
to your boss's boss and tell him

16:24.839 --> 16:29.241
that you can either lose
your 15 million right now

16:29.508 --> 16:30.508
or

16:30.940 --> 16:34.741
you can give me another seven million loan

16:36.008 --> 16:40.909
and you can lose your
22 million in thre years.

16:41.575 --> 16:42.876
Tanko.

16:44.210 --> 16:45.543
Here.

16:46.777 --> 16:48.511
Present for your boss.

16:48.610 --> 16:52.378
Because your bank has
been a reliable partner

16:52.478 --> 16:55.978
and I hope in the future we
will continue to work together.

16:56.079 --> 16:59.578
And because I really like this guy,

16:59.678 --> 17:02.546
you have a free room in my hotel.

17:03.013 --> 17:05.746
I already told them to put
you next room to my film crew.

17:05.846 --> 17:09.946
So, go, change this shirt,
take a shit, but don't wank,

17:10.048 --> 17:14.214
because I have good plans for tonight.

17:25.848 --> 17:28.518
We have nothing, basically.

17:28.750 --> 17:34.052
- No, we have some stuff.
- What? A couple of hours of ramblings, that's it.

17:34.419 --> 17:36.052
And. Why do you care so much?

17:36.152 --> 17:40.319
Because I was telling Dave that this
schedule will not work with this guy.

17:40.420 --> 17:42.420
He just does whatever he wants.

17:42.520 --> 17:45.653
And now Dave is going to be like
"Well, should have been here".

17:45.753 --> 17:48.154
Like what, we don't know what we are doing.

17:48.720 --> 17:52.621
I care because today is a
write-off and it pisses me off.

17:53.055 --> 17:56.755
Come on, don't write it
off yet. Tonight might be massive.

17:56.855 --> 17:59.955
I'm not going to his shitty club. No way.

18:00.056 --> 18:03.956
What about the chocolate factory and
the meeting with the lawyer, the banker?

18:04.057 --> 18:07.157
I mean, this is all material
that we have. It's not nothing.

18:07.490 --> 18:10.258
Yeah, but how does that fit in?

18:10.891 --> 18:12.491
I will tell you how
- it doesn't.

18:43.662 --> 18:47.696
Cameraman, you have to
be here all the time.

18:47.797 --> 18:51.898
Filming everything. You know? Understood?

18:54.398 --> 19:00.166
My friend here is talking to me about
sanctions like they are something bad.

19:00.433 --> 19:02.033
But they are bad.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.000
Listen to me. Write this down, banker.

19:05.100 --> 19:11.068
Behind every successful
trafficker there is an embargo.

19:11.168 --> 19:12.334
Embargo, you know.

19:13.268 --> 19:18.469
Because people with money,
they always get what they need.

19:18.568 --> 19:20.470
You know, rich people,
they get what they need.

19:20.569 --> 19:27.804
The only difference is who they
buy it from and at what price.

19:28.337 --> 19:29.937
Hey,

19:33.539 --> 19:36.704
I pray for sanctions every day. Every day.

20:07.110 --> 20:07.877
So...

20:07.977 --> 20:11.011
I know a lot of friends around here.

20:11.111 --> 20:14.145
- I have a lot of friends, you know.
- Yeah, I can see that.

20:14.245 --> 20:18.678
I'm not talking about these brainless
peasants. I'm talking about big fish.

20:18.778 --> 20:27.147
Like prosecutors, judges, mayors, MPs,
bankruptcy administrators, you know, surveyors.

20:27.247 --> 20:32.449
Because real friends cost
money,

20:32.681 --> 20:34.348
Everything costs money.

20:34.614 --> 20:37.949
If you don't understand this,
you are not ready for this world.

20:41.216 --> 20:42.615
Joke.

20:43.383 --> 20:50.085
Beautiful girls, very beautiful ones.
Come, come here, come. Come to papa.

20:51.552 --> 20:52.684
Come.

20:59.618 --> 21:02.586
Night club,

21:10.488 --> 21:11.954
Very good.

21:13.455 --> 21:18.155
Nice, nice, nice, nice.

21:23.023 --> 21:23.756
Good!

21:24.323 --> 21:28.024
Are we doing the interview
at the city council today?

21:33.158 --> 21:35.292
Are we doing it?

21:35.392 --> 21:36.425
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

21:36.525 --> 21:39.725
Maybe we'll do it. Or maybe we won't.

21:40.159 --> 21:45.726
First I'm taking my godson
to his favourite restaurant

21:45.827 --> 21:49.027
and then I'll decide what we are doing.

21:49.127 --> 21:50.195
Is that OK?

21:50.295 --> 21:53.562
Well, we have a different
agreement, so not really.

21:53.661 --> 21:55.761
We agreed you would show us around

21:55.862 --> 22:00.062
but then you would also
let us play by the script.

22:02.629 --> 22:07.330
Listen to me. I told you yesterday
I don't work with a script.

22:07.831 --> 22:11.431
Especially some uninformed trash

22:11.864 --> 22:14.832
that your producer's boyfriend
wrote in the summer break.

22:14.932 --> 22:16.365
That's irrelevant.

22:16.466 --> 22:18.132
No, it's not.

22:19.199 --> 22:20.467
We had an agreement.

22:20.567 --> 22:24.467
Yeah, I know. But if your producer
has any concerns or any problems

22:24.567 --> 22:26.900
he can tell me in person.

22:27.301 --> 22:28.800
Come here and tell me in person.

22:28.900 --> 22:33.901
I'll pay him the flight. Business
class, of course. Everything.

22:34.268 --> 22:39.536
Until then you can all fuck
off with this script, you know.

22:40.103 --> 22:43.903
Because I'm paying everything
for you here, everything.

22:47.237 --> 22:51.405
Because if you really wanted to make
a documentary on money laundering,

22:51.505 --> 22:55.438
there are professional laundering
networks and organisations.

22:55.538 --> 22:57.738
And they do everything for you -

22:57.972 --> 23:01.406
recruit money mules and frontmen
for your shell companies,

23:01.506 --> 23:02.873
produce fake documentation,

23:02.973 --> 23:06.706
open bank accounts, buy and sell assets,

23:06.806 --> 23:09.541
orchestrate lawsuits. That's what they do.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.141
But you don't care.

23:11.241 --> 23:15.075
All you want is cheap hipster
entertainment. That's what you want.

23:15.175 --> 23:18.808
And that's why this is
not your project anymore.

23:18.908 --> 23:22.577
Now we are making cinema.

23:22.676 --> 23:25.276
Not documentary. Cinema. Big cinema.

23:25.376 --> 23:27.844
"Danny. Legend. God."

23:27.944 --> 23:30.177
With a full stop between the words.

23:30.777 --> 23:36.178
Yes. And the script is here
- in my head.

23:37.745 --> 23:42.912
You will see what's going on. In
one week, you will see what happens.

23:47.813 --> 23:55.482
I've been city councillor for ten years.
Ten years, three different parties.

23:55.582 --> 23:57.483
Because the colours change,

23:57.583 --> 24:00.682
but the important people don't.

24:06.117 --> 24:10.251
Can you see, do you see this wall?

24:10.351 --> 24:12.384
This part used to be destroyed.

24:12.485 --> 24:17.486
So it was like a shortcut to
go over there and smoke weed.

24:17.785 --> 24:22.453
And how the fuck do kids smoke up nowadays?

24:22.553 --> 24:29.121
Ah, look
- they need to go all around the whole fucking school to go over there and get high.

24:29.221 --> 24:33.955
This is out of order. I don't know.
They destroyed the whole country.

24:39.356 --> 24:41.456
Cameraman, godson.

24:41.556 --> 24:44.090
This is the future.

24:44.190 --> 24:45.690
The future don.

24:48.357 --> 24:52.558
Come on, you need to go and sit in
the back. Fast, fast, fast, quick!

24:52.657 --> 24:55.692
- OK, don't touch me!
- OK, go, go, go.

25:17.928 --> 25:21.396
Susan, please. Thank
you. You are very kind.

25:53.135 --> 25:56.935
Sometimes we sit here all day long.

25:57.035 --> 26:01.302
Watching asses and boobs around.

26:01.402 --> 26:04.137
Not many at this hour though.

26:05.769 --> 26:10.404
There is some stupid white
trash in a wheelchair.

26:10.704 --> 26:11.837
Bunch of

26:12.304 --> 26:14.239
peasants, plasterers,

26:14.339 --> 26:15.638
prostitute,

26:16.506 --> 26:18.638
future prostitute.

26:19.005 --> 26:22.039
Nothing interesting. Bad luck.

26:34.908 --> 26:41.143
At 20 he will be a chairman
of a government enterprise.

26:41.243 --> 26:42.576
I swear.

26:42.675 --> 26:45.244
At 22 he will be MP.

26:45.810 --> 26:50.111
Before 30 this young citizen

26:50.211 --> 26:54.378
will control one of the key
industries in the country -

26:54.677 --> 26:55.745
energy,

26:55.845 --> 26:56.945
infrastructure

26:57.045 --> 26:59.479
or defence. It's up to you.

26:59.845 --> 27:03.480
I own the whole fucking place.

27:03.813 --> 27:06.480
I own 100 horses.

27:07.046 --> 27:11.081
They don't need one
year to know how to walk.

27:11.348 --> 27:16.115
They come out, in 20
minutes they know how to run.

27:16.815 --> 27:20.483
This is the best breed for harness work,

27:20.583 --> 27:22.583
for driving work, for everything,

27:22.682 --> 27:30.117
undersaddle competitions,
endurance riding. This is the horse!

27:36.519 --> 27:38.919
Who's the real cowboy now? Sorry.

27:39.019 --> 27:41.419
- I was meant to touch them.
- Yeah, I stressed them.

27:41.520 --> 27:47.020
I'm like this sometimes. I
scare people, horses.

27:47.887 --> 27:50.155
Do you come here often?

27:52.321 --> 27:54.054
It depends.

27:54.522 --> 27:56.688
If I want to impress someone.

27:56.788 --> 27:58.456
So you are trying to impress me.

27:58.556 --> 28:06.090
No, I'm trying to impress the whole crew,
I want to show the world my treasure.

28:06.190 --> 28:09.957
That's why we are here. To show you.

28:10.057 --> 28:11.857
My country.

28:12.857 --> 28:17.359
- You have a very pretty country.
- Yeah.

28:21.393 --> 28:24.026
You want to go more in front?

28:24.126 --> 28:28.760
- Well, I'd like to get out.
- Yeah, we are going.

28:34.228 --> 28:39.496
- Do you own this land?
- Not all of it. Not yet.

28:39.862 --> 28:42.229
But the godson, for sure he will own this.

28:42.329 --> 28:45.897
You have big
ambitions for him, don't you?

28:46.963 --> 28:50.131
Come on, cameraman, come out.

29:17.768 --> 29:21.503
This is like bonus stage for you.

29:21.936 --> 29:24.370
Because this is my temple.

29:24.903 --> 29:26.337
This is my church.

29:26.437 --> 29:27.904
The theatre is your church?

29:28.004 --> 29:30.803
My temple. First
my temple, then my church.

29:30.904 --> 29:33.405
- I'm impressed.
- Yes.

29:33.804 --> 29:36.771
Sometimes I do sing operas. Hello.

29:37.071 --> 29:41.906
- So you are a singer?
- Of course. I am a ballet dancer, I am a...

29:42.006 --> 29:46.706
I think I think they are rehearsing.

29:48.641 --> 29:51.908
You are right. They
are rehearsing. Let's...

29:52.542 --> 29:58.209
Excuse me. Hello. We are foreigners,
coming here from faraway lands.

29:58.309 --> 30:03.210
Would you please help us?
Give us a cup of water, please?

30:03.709 --> 30:05.043
- Sorry for the interruption.
- It's OK.

30:05.143 --> 30:07.143
- I'm Susan.
- This is my girlfriend.

30:07.243 --> 30:09.011
Nice to meet you.

30:13.811 --> 30:16.445
- After you.
- Thank you.

30:17.379 --> 30:18.878
Come on.

30:19.812 --> 30:23.446
- You saw that? You got that, cameraman?
- Yeah, yeah.

30:23.547 --> 30:25.013
What an athlete!

31:16.122 --> 31:17.755
- Go with the flow.
- Dave!

31:17.855 --> 31:21.889
If you see a moment, get in there, try
to get in there, capture the moment.

31:21.989 --> 31:27.357
Dave, why am I here? This isn't
a documentary series anymore.

31:29.090 --> 31:31.691
Sorry, love, I didn't
catch that, what did you say?

31:31.791 --> 31:33.158
Can you hear me?

31:34.292 --> 31:39.193
Yeah, yeah, I can hear you.
Sure, can. Yeah, every word every word.

31:39.426 --> 31:43.993
Dave, he is not listening to me. He
barely speaks to me unless he shouts.

31:44.093 --> 31:50.428
And, you know, he is coked out half the time.
He just starts one sentence and finishes another.

31:50.761 --> 31:55.529
Look, dear, I know this is not a
completely controlled environment.

31:55.629 --> 31:58.029
I know it's not completely controlled.

31:58.129 --> 32:01.630
But I trust you. I trust your judgement.

32:02.230 --> 32:05.664
Well, we have a shot of him
getting a blowjob. Will that do it?

32:05.763 --> 32:08.531
- Well, actually the shot is not so clear.
- What?

32:08.631 --> 32:11.331
Yeah, we couldn't get a clear shot of him.

32:11.897 --> 32:15.299
Look, just, you just power on through it...

32:15.399 --> 32:22.033
you power on through, you wrap it, I
wil sort out the blowjob in the edit.

32:23.667 --> 32:25.767
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

32:29.501 --> 32:30.733
Hi, I'm Susan.

32:31.167 --> 32:34.502
This is my wife, Farty Pussy.

32:34.768 --> 32:36.068
I beg your pardon?

32:36.168 --> 32:37.436
Farty Pussy.

32:37.536 --> 32:43.337
I swear to God, this is the woman
with the most air in her pussy.

32:43.770 --> 32:49.170
I don't know what she is doing all day.
Maybe she is pumping air in her pussy.

33:07.907 --> 33:12.241
Help yourself. Don't stay like this.
I'm not going to serve you, you know.

33:12.341 --> 33:14.741
- That's alright, you don't need to.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:14.841 --> 33:17.442
Most of it is on my plate anyway.

33:18.375 --> 33:22.943
- And you know, this is a very special bread.
- What is it?

33:23.176 --> 33:28.177
Cheers. Bread. National
dish. With lucks inside.

33:28.277 --> 33:29.411
With what?

33:39.413 --> 33:43.146
I recommend you a wife like her.

33:43.247 --> 33:44.280
Posh one.

33:44.647 --> 33:47.581
She doesn't cook, she doesn't clean.

33:47.813 --> 33:54.948
I think she doesn't even realise that
we have chefs, gardeners, cleaners.

33:55.416 --> 34:01.115
She must assume that the cooked
food grows in the kitchen.

34:02.849 --> 34:05.783
Anyway, she is alright.

34:06.983 --> 34:10.850
Compared to all the
idiots I'm surrounded by.

34:46.755 --> 34:49.592
Cold. Is it OK? Do you want to go inside?

34:49.692 --> 34:51.991
- It's alright.
- I can tell people.

34:52.091 --> 34:56.226
They will move the whole fucking
thing inside. I will tell them.

34:56.326 --> 34:57.492
- I'm alright.
- Sure?

34:57.593 --> 34:58.792
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I'm OK, too.

34:58.892 --> 35:01.460
You OK? I don't care,
junkie, shut the fuck up.

35:01.560 --> 35:08.127
You want to eat something? There is only salad
for you. Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

35:30.698 --> 35:36.198
So, for tomorrow I've planned...

35:39.765 --> 35:41.832
TANKO! I...

35:41.932 --> 35:43.866
- What happened?
- I forgot something.

35:43.967 --> 35:46.334
You you don't remind me. You are...

35:46.434 --> 35:48.200
You are fucking with me?
You are playing games?

35:48.300 --> 35:50.268
- TANKO!
- What are you talking about?

35:50.368 --> 35:51.435
I'll show you.

35:52.368 --> 35:53.401
TANKO!

35:54.468 --> 35:57.269
I am a better actress than he is.

35:57.369 --> 36:01.570
I guess so. Why
are you with him anyway?

36:01.670 --> 36:03.237
What do you mean?

36:03.337 --> 36:08.238
Get a divorce, pocket a million
or two, disappear into the sunset.

36:09.605 --> 36:10.870
No.

36:12.870 --> 36:17.172
He got me a widow and he is
going to leave me a widow.

36:48.644 --> 36:50.378
Do you believe in her?

36:50.478 --> 36:57.212
Look, if a woman wants to go and make a
blowjob she will do whatever she wants.

36:57.312 --> 36:58.845
Yeah, but that's not what I'm saying.

36:58.945 --> 37:00.745
Yeah, I know but

37:00.845 --> 37:04.513
this is a very personal question so I
don't want to answer that kind of questions.

37:04.614 --> 37:09.248
So let's not talk about me, let's
talk about blowjobs. It's very good.

37:09.348 --> 37:12.514
I like when you are talking about blowjobs.

37:13.215 --> 37:16.182
It makes sense. You know. Makes sense.

37:16.282 --> 37:19.516
- It does?
- What? Do you like to make blowjobs?

37:19.617 --> 37:24.283
- That's not... That's not what we are talking about.
- Yeah, that was my question.

37:24.383 --> 37:28.050
Don't run from it. Hey, Jamie,
do you like to make blowjobs?

37:28.150 --> 37:30.850
I'm sure you do. Don't answer me. I know.

37:33.485 --> 37:35.851
...What's happened?

37:50.455 --> 37:51.787
- Look
- What's happened?

37:51.887 --> 37:53.821
I'm talking right now on
the phone and I'm driving.

37:53.921 --> 37:57.155
So if you don't want to make
some accident or something,

37:57.256 --> 37:59.522
please, don't bother me, right now.

37:59.922 --> 38:01.557
I want to know what's going on, so,

38:01.657 --> 38:08.391
and you never seem to tell me, so
I, what else am I supposed to do?

38:09.725 --> 38:10.991
OK.

38:11.324 --> 38:12.591
Look.

38:12.992 --> 38:17.192
We need to give a lesson to someone.

38:18.359 --> 38:19.326
What do you mean?

38:19.426 --> 38:23.792
I mean we need to give
a lesson to a teacher.

38:24.360 --> 38:30.227
To make him understand how
the food chain is situated.

38:30.728 --> 38:35.528
You need to do what? I'm sorry, I don't understand what you're saying.

38:35.629 --> 38:39.096
Wait and you will see. And
you will record it, no problem.

38:39.196 --> 38:43.197
And why are you so impatient, honey?

38:46.097 --> 38:48.896
You know, I don't want to do
this anymore. I've had enough.

38:48.998 --> 38:53.198
OK, we don't need you
anymore, so go then. That's OK.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.864
Stop the car, please!

38:56.366 --> 38:57.666
I'd like to go.

38:57.765 --> 38:59.432
- Go pack your things
- Perfect!

38:59.532 --> 39:03.799
and go back home and write for dating
sites and coffees and things like that.

39:04.133 --> 39:07.967
- Don't touch me!
- I won't touch you! I even...

39:09.967 --> 39:12.067
Where are you going?

39:13.901 --> 39:19.802
Listen to me. Say bye bye to this fucking
bitch and stay on your seat. Right, junkie?

39:21.703 --> 39:23.270
Can I go?

39:25.671 --> 39:26.837
Fucking bitch!

41:23.189 --> 41:26.090
How good is that the annoying one is gone.

41:26.190 --> 41:28.790
How fucking annoying was she.

41:29.157 --> 41:30.257
Bitch.

41:33.392 --> 41:38.892
She reminds me of these feminists
who fight for the rights of sex dolls.

41:39.660 --> 41:42.793
I'm equally intolerant to everyone.

41:42.893 --> 41:46.793
So she scored zero social justice points.

41:46.893 --> 41:48.260
That's it.

41:48.527 --> 41:51.128
I'm not freaking out. I just don't
want to be a part of this anymore.

41:51.228 --> 41:55.095
Yeah, I know, mate. It's
a weird project, that's for sure.

41:55.195 --> 41:57.329
Yeah, we should be doing something.

41:57.429 --> 41:58.462
Like what?

41:58.729 --> 42:00.596
Like going to the police with the footage.

42:00.696 --> 42:03.996
The police here?!
Mate, are you having a laugh?

42:04.096 --> 42:05.597
Are you serious?

42:06.263 --> 42:08.498
I mean, what we are
doing here can't be legal.

42:08.598 --> 42:10.298
You see everything that's going on.

42:10.398 --> 42:13.599
We are standing around doing nothing while
he does all of these crazy things. It's...

42:13.699 --> 42:15.865
We are accomplices.

42:15.965 --> 42:18.499
Jamie, we are not accomplices. Look at me.
Now think about it. You know what you signed up for.

42:18.599 --> 42:20.832
It's not a wedding, you know. We are not
here shooting a wedding. What do you expect?

42:20.932 --> 42:23.899
If we were shooting Planet Earth would
you go and save the zebra from the lions?

42:23.999 --> 42:25.867
Come on, remember the penguins.

42:26.100 --> 42:28.467
That's ridiculous. Why would you say this?

42:28.567 --> 42:30.367
OK look.

42:30.467 --> 42:31.769
Here's what I think.

42:31.868 --> 42:35.001
Let's just finish this and... it's
our project, you know, we own it.

42:35.101 --> 42:37.102
It's a good opportunity. And...

42:37.202 --> 42:39.670
You know, what we are doing here
is let's say we are exposing him.

42:39.770 --> 42:41.403
When the film gets out he is finished.

42:41.503 --> 42:44.404
You know, this guy thinks he
is invincible, but he is not.

42:44.771 --> 42:47.170
Nothing more to think about.

42:47.771 --> 42:50.171
Is this junkie doing a good job?

42:50.271 --> 42:53.638
Yeah. He is doing
great. No problems at all.

42:53.937 --> 43:00.372
Because I can send him home and find
you another one - soundman - today.

43:00.472 --> 43:03.307
I don't
think it's needed, really.

43:05.473 --> 43:06.907
The choice is yours.

43:07.007 --> 43:09.374
But I can do that, you know.

43:17.975 --> 43:19.510
Look at him.

43:29.678 --> 43:33.512
Right now you are my main man.

43:34.345 --> 43:37.979
Good? Can you handle this responsibility?

43:38.079 --> 43:41.446
- Yep.
- Yep. OK.

43:42.346 --> 43:46.147
I want you to show me
later what you've shot.

43:46.480 --> 43:48.314
I want to see how it looks.

43:48.914 --> 43:49.881
It's a lot!

43:49.981 --> 43:51.481
I know it's a lot.

43:51.581 --> 43:53.148
It better be a lot.

43:53.248 --> 43:57.516
I said I want to see how it looks.

43:57.616 --> 44:02.183
I don't want to watch one
week of footage. Right? Good?

44:02.283 --> 44:06.350
- OK, no problem.
- OK, no problem. Good.

44:17.052 --> 44:18.485
- What is this?
- It's your change.

44:18.585 --> 44:23.253
Give me the half. Keep it,
son. You deserve this part.

45:11.094 --> 45:13.062
Yeah, I know, but...

45:13.495 --> 45:18.195
Yeah, but the schedule went
out the window like a week ago.

45:19.163 --> 45:21.697
What? No, don't worry about
it, we don't need any money.

45:21.797 --> 45:23.697
He is paying for everything.

45:23.797 --> 45:26.464
So far everything seems to be OK.

45:27.963 --> 45:30.364
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

45:32.864 --> 45:34.365
Oh, God, no.

45:34.699 --> 45:38.333
No, maybe like another week or so.

45:40.299 --> 45:42.634
Well, if anything changes,
I will let you know.

45:42.966 --> 45:45.701
Yeah, OK, OK. Alright, bye.

45:46.233 --> 45:55.402
I have ears everywhere so
now I have some rumours.

45:56.102 --> 46:00.302
So. Come on, cameraman, get down.

46:07.571 --> 46:10.071
Junkie, follow me.

46:11.904 --> 46:13.272
Look out.

47:17.716 --> 47:19.016
Cool, huh?

48:56.466 --> 49:02.500
Do you know how this officer of
the law is completing crosswords?

49:03.033 --> 49:04.533
He draws boxes.

49:04.633 --> 49:11.000
He adds additional boxes so he can
fit the nonsense he comes up with.

49:12.802 --> 49:16.202
There was a mistake! I'm sure.

51:00.487 --> 51:04.120
- What the fuck!?
- What the fuck. Look at him, look at him.

51:04.220 --> 51:08.454
- Come on!
- The naked truth. The producer of shit.

51:14.088 --> 51:16.055
You can eat it.

51:16.155 --> 51:17.555
Thank you.

51:20.223 --> 51:21.256
Welcome.

51:23.056 --> 51:26.190
Hey.

51:26.457 --> 51:27.858
Did you wash your hands?

51:28.290 --> 51:31.458
Boys, what's your sort of role
here? What are you playing?

51:31.558 --> 51:34.924
Well, we are filming a TV
series about money laundering.

51:35.158 --> 51:40.259
Shut the fuck up. Don't listen to him.
He is a junkie. He don't know nothing.

51:40.359 --> 51:43.727
This is a film. This is big cinema.

51:43.827 --> 51:46.960
But we are here for work.

51:48.093 --> 51:51.461
- We've got a new renegade in this town.
- Let's see.

51:51.561 --> 51:53.628
Here you have everything.

51:53.728 --> 51:59.229
You have transcript of the police
report, you have criminal record,

51:59.863 --> 52:02.230
you have employment history, dick pics.

52:02.330 --> 52:07.598
He will write to NGOs and
campaigners. Wow. What a citizen.

52:07.698 --> 52:12.499
Yes. He will be the difference
he wants to see in the future.

52:12.599 --> 52:14.766
Come up with something. Create.

52:15.031 --> 52:18.433
OK, if this guy fancies
himself as a real activist,

52:18.533 --> 52:23.566
let's hit him with a proper conspiracy,
not just throw some gossip around.

52:24.667 --> 52:27.100
OK. Any suggestions? Like what?

52:27.200 --> 52:30.802
Here's my idea. His wife is
fucking an old commie general.

52:30.901 --> 52:39.102
So this bastard is protecting him and also
grooming him for the next city council seat.

52:39.202 --> 52:41.603
Persecution! You are being persecuted!

52:41.703 --> 52:42.871
Yes, very good one.

52:43.137 --> 52:45.470
- Bullying is trendy. I like it.
- Good.

52:45.771 --> 52:48.904
His son is selling drugs in school.

52:49.204 --> 52:54.138
If he survives all that, I'll
just break his fucking knees.

52:54.672 --> 52:56.305
That's a classic.

52:56.806 --> 52:59.339
Oldschool party classic.

52:59.706 --> 53:01.840
Yep, that works, too.

53:02.106 --> 53:04.973
Something to drink?
Give me a whiskey, something?

53:05.073 --> 53:06.674
How about a mojito?

53:06.775 --> 53:08.040
Yeah, good one.

53:23.710 --> 53:26.577
Because this is very authentic.

53:27.110 --> 53:31.078
Now, the cat, we put it
there, back to reality.

53:39.780 --> 53:42.313
Suzie is not coming back, huh?

53:42.414 --> 53:44.046
Very sad.

57:57.155 --> 57:58.955
Look at them!

57:59.522 --> 58:00.989
They live like animals.

58:03.623 --> 58:05.123
This is disgusting.

58:05.223 --> 58:09.524
But this place is good.
Really. Now you'll see.

58:14.492 --> 58:16.025
Boo!

58:19.827 --> 58:21.359
This is my crew.

58:39.029 --> 58:41.229
Sit here, soundman.

58:41.329 --> 58:44.963
And camera guy, on the couch, sit.

58:45.564 --> 58:46.297
Now...

58:46.397 --> 58:50.898
We'll do a small break here, so

58:50.997 --> 58:53.131
enjoy your stay!

59:05.133 --> 59:06.868
What are you doing?

59:07.167 --> 59:09.334
Where are you going?

01:00:16.445 --> 01:00:17.178
The blue one.

01:00:17.278 --> 01:00:19.680
Thank you. Thank you, my lovely.

01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:21.213
Thank you.

01:00:22.112 --> 01:00:23.881
You are my everything.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.314
And a little bit more

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.113
of everything.

01:00:29.447 --> 01:00:30.582
So.

01:00:31.949 --> 01:00:34.548
Big things are about to happen.

01:00:40.616 --> 01:00:42.350
Get the party started.

01:00:42.784 --> 01:00:46.317
So. I make a reservation for tonight.

01:00:46.550 --> 01:00:48.017
Because we'll have a

01:00:48.117 --> 01:00:52.318
♪ Celebration, come on ♪

01:00:54.886 --> 01:00:58.652
Good. Tanko,

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:02.019
Do you remember when I told you

01:01:02.119 --> 01:01:04.520
"Watch me become the king".

01:01:04.753 --> 01:01:07.054
Now is the time. Now you'll see.

01:01:07.354 --> 01:01:13.355
Big things are happening
right now, in front of you.

01:01:14.622 --> 01:01:15.956
And you'll witness.

01:01:16.055 --> 01:01:17.422
Oh, my God.

01:01:24.090 --> 01:01:26.257
High class security.

01:01:49.361 --> 01:01:53.328
No shaking, no nothing.
Good luck. Thank you.

01:02:37.603 --> 01:02:40.135
Man, we should
have put a mic on him.

01:02:40.236 --> 01:02:42.804
Yeah, but maybe they would find it.

01:02:43.604 --> 01:02:47.270
I don't know. I reckon we
could have hidden one. That's for sure.

01:03:50.748 --> 01:03:52.615
Cameraman, come.

01:04:00.683 --> 01:04:02.016
Good, huh?

01:04:07.050 --> 01:04:09.050
That was a good flying kick, huh?

01:04:47.892 --> 01:04:49.725
You will cut this part.

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.759
I will cut his...

01:05:05.761 --> 01:05:08.494
Old party apparatus,

01:05:09.094 --> 01:05:12.161
ex-informants, secret police,

01:05:13.028 --> 01:05:14.362
their offspring,

01:05:14.462 --> 01:05:16.428
their bodyguards

01:05:21.897 --> 01:05:24.731
treated me like a village fool.

01:05:33.064 --> 01:05:36.699
Using condescending tone.

01:05:46.166 --> 01:05:52.468
They treat me like I
don't know how it works.

01:05:55.636 --> 01:05:59.235
They pretend that I was born yesterday.

01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:03.570
Hey, junkie.

01:06:05.136 --> 01:06:08.437
Do you know how a project like this works?

01:06:11.104 --> 01:06:12.272
No.

01:06:12.705 --> 01:06:14.739
Of course you don't.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:17.305
All you know is

01:06:17.606 --> 01:06:18.606
pills

01:06:18.706 --> 01:06:20.072
and parties, huh.

01:06:20.172 --> 01:06:22.706
That's your understanding of life.

01:06:23.874 --> 01:06:25.707
Fucking junkie.

01:06:39.976 --> 01:06:42.844
The power plant will not be built.

01:06:43.544 --> 01:06:46.477
And there will be a
massive hole in the ground.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:52.611
Because building a power plant
is not like building a kebab shop.

01:06:53.311 --> 01:06:56.779
It takes a few governments to agree.

01:06:57.112 --> 01:06:58.679
There are very

01:07:01.713 --> 01:07:08.614
complex national security
and geopolitical aspects.

01:07:09.015 --> 01:07:11.047
Unions will be involved.

01:07:11.281 --> 01:07:14.115
Environmentalists will be involved.

01:07:14.215 --> 01:07:15.815
There are risks.

01:07:16.382 --> 01:07:19.750
In this case there will be an accident.

01:07:19.983 --> 01:07:24.884
Very likely, or I should say
certainly, there will be casualties.

01:07:24.984 --> 01:07:28.384
Small explosion with a chemical leak.

01:07:29.518 --> 01:07:33.785
So the work on the plant will
start and then it will stop.

01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:40.119
And then it will start
again and put on hold.

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.854
For re-planning

01:07:42.954 --> 01:07:45.654
and it will be reconsidered.

01:07:45.921 --> 01:07:51.721
A lot of money will be spent on
consulting, planning, permissions,

01:07:51.821 --> 01:07:55.255
negotiations, digging a
massive hole in the ground.

01:07:55.355 --> 01:07:58.255
So
- money, money, money.

01:07:58.889 --> 01:08:00.590
Credits will be given.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.056
And finally

01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:06.558
the bank will go bankrupt.

01:08:07.025 --> 01:08:10.457
And there will be a lot of assets for us.

01:08:18.292 --> 01:08:21.926
Incidentally, this will be the bank

01:08:22.426 --> 01:08:26.661
that handles the social security payment,

01:08:27.093 --> 01:08:31.361
that hosts the accounts
of the national telecom,

01:08:31.929 --> 01:08:37.496
the judiciary, the police, the
customs, the national lottery,

01:08:39.029 --> 01:08:43.363
the national energy companies.

01:08:43.930 --> 01:08:45.729
Do you follow?

01:08:46.031 --> 01:08:53.732
And they told me to stay away from drugs, from
weapons, from prostitutes, from human trafficking.

01:08:53.832 --> 01:08:55.832
So I did.

01:08:56.631 --> 01:08:57.732
Do you know...

01:08:58.232 --> 01:09:04.466
Do you realise just how
much money I could have made?

01:09:07.533 --> 01:09:10.067
So they ask me for propaganda.

01:09:10.167 --> 01:09:15.268
So I gave them the best
propaganda. For what?

01:09:17.536 --> 01:09:20.970
For treating me like a village fool.

01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:24.636
You are fucking with the wrong guy.

01:09:25.069 --> 01:09:28.337
You are fucking with the fucking wrong guy.

01:09:28.437 --> 01:09:31.705
Because my time is coming

01:09:33.705 --> 01:09:35.406
pretty soon.

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:38.773
You will die in my piss.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:41.072
I promise you this.

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:25.314
I broke a 3,000 dollar
suit with this flying kick.

01:10:25.414 --> 01:10:27.814
Just like that, for the film.

01:10:27.914 --> 01:10:30.015
I don't care. It's OK.

01:10:30.114 --> 01:10:31.782
Good for the film.

01:10:32.114 --> 01:10:33.815
Good for me.

01:10:40.649 --> 01:10:44.951
This is the legendary fail of my life.

01:10:47.216 --> 01:10:48.785
We'll be alright.

01:10:49.318 --> 01:10:51.585
We'll be fucking alright.

01:10:52.251 --> 01:10:54.752
We'll fuck them real hard.

01:10:55.519 --> 01:10:58.019
Big things are about to happen.

01:10:58.118 --> 01:11:00.620
The troll farm is working!

01:11:15.655 --> 01:11:17.756
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:11:22.723 --> 01:11:25.123
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:11:39.092 --> 01:11:40.626
Hello.

01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:48.595
Thank you.

01:14:03.183 --> 01:14:07.784
I got a call from somebody today.

01:14:11.117 --> 01:14:12.752
From who?

01:14:13.986 --> 01:14:17.151
A girl from the Taekwondo.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:22.620
She can kick you in three
places with one kick jump.

01:14:24.153 --> 01:14:26.220
♪ She wants to meet ♪

01:14:26.320 --> 01:14:28.587
♪ She wants to meet ♪

01:14:46.857 --> 01:14:51.491
Vicky and I, we had something

01:14:51.858 --> 01:14:53.525
before.

01:14:54.926 --> 01:14:58.359
Once we were about to fuck.

01:14:58.692 --> 01:15:02.693
We were in her room before one competition.

01:15:02.793 --> 01:15:05.861
We were doing things.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.160
And then

01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:09.194
the stupid coach came

01:15:09.294 --> 01:15:11.562
and dragged me out.

01:15:12.595 --> 01:15:17.329
I don't know why I didn't smash his face.

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.563
Anyway.

01:15:21.863 --> 01:15:25.297
You haven't seen a girl like her.

01:15:25.864 --> 01:15:29.565
Back then she was just a girl,

01:15:29.798 --> 01:15:34.832
but you could tell that she
was already woman with class.

01:15:34.932 --> 01:15:36.733
And she is fucking smart!

01:15:37.066 --> 01:15:41.567
Don't even try to pretend that you're
working for a real Hollywood studio.

01:15:41.667 --> 01:15:45.634
She will mock you and
you won't even realise.

01:15:53.103 --> 01:15:55.836
Vicky!

01:16:01.336 --> 01:16:04.370
This is my film crew. We are making a film.

01:16:11.739 --> 01:16:13.438
A star is born.

01:16:13.538 --> 01:16:14.639
Yes.

01:16:14.739 --> 01:16:18.172
I'm working for the people
and I'm working for the town.

01:16:18.272 --> 01:16:21.040
I want everything to be perfect.

01:16:21.139 --> 01:16:24.207
I want every playground, every park,

01:16:24.307 --> 01:16:26.474
everything to be

01:16:27.173 --> 01:16:28.173
tip top.

01:16:28.273 --> 01:16:30.375
But there is never enough money, you know.

01:16:30.975 --> 01:16:32.875
Not enough money. But...

01:16:44.710 --> 01:16:50.478
- Thank you, and you can take all this.
- Thank you, sir.

01:16:55.646 --> 01:16:57.379
I... I...

01:16:57.479 --> 01:16:58.879
forgot

01:16:59.346 --> 01:17:01.480
what I was about to tell you.

01:17:08.614 --> 01:17:09.581
What is this?

01:17:09.681 --> 01:17:12.782
I am waiting for the waiter.

01:17:12.882 --> 01:17:14.582
- Come on.
- No

01:17:14.915 --> 01:17:20.850
Don't worry. Here they
don't have good steak knives.

01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:23.617
- So you brought your own?
- Yes.

01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:27.651
My father was in a hospital.

01:17:27.751 --> 01:17:30.184
And he was very worried.

01:17:30.284 --> 01:17:32.318
He asked one of the nurses to

01:17:32.418 --> 01:17:36.120
go feed the kitty, but
nurses are super busy.

01:17:36.386 --> 01:17:38.819
- 16-hour shifts, you know.
- I know.

01:17:38.919 --> 01:17:46.253
The hospitals are understaffed and it's quite
embarrassing that great people like your dad,

01:17:46.353 --> 01:17:49.655
they don't get the attention they deserve.

01:17:49.755 --> 01:17:50.888
Yeah.

01:17:50.988 --> 01:17:53.489
And, of course, the hospitals'
budgets are set centrally,

01:17:53.589 --> 01:17:56.889
- so there's nothing we can do here.
- I understand.

01:17:56.989 --> 01:17:59.090
- Sad situation.
- Yeah.

01:17:59.189 --> 01:18:01.490
- Do you smoke, Vicky?
- No.

01:18:15.092 --> 01:18:17.060
- Welcome back.
- Yeah!

01:18:17.159 --> 01:18:19.793
Some fresh air it's really...

01:18:25.061 --> 01:18:27.727
Good, good, good, good.

01:18:28.694 --> 01:18:33.628
And so. You are still
looking for a job here, huh?

01:18:33.728 --> 01:18:36.096
Well, no. Not now.

01:18:36.195 --> 01:18:39.096
I want to stay with my
father. I have some savings.

01:18:39.195 --> 01:18:41.730
Let's see how it goes.

01:18:42.497 --> 01:18:44.797
I want just to inform you.

01:18:44.897 --> 01:18:52.665
If you need something whatever,
just tell me. Just, just tell me.

01:18:52.765 --> 01:18:56.766
Thank you, Danny. That's so nice of you,
but I really hope it won't be necessary.

01:18:56.866 --> 01:19:01.466
But anyways, thank you though.
Really. That's really nice.

01:19:06.001 --> 01:19:07.701
Good, good, good, good.

01:19:07.801 --> 01:19:11.335
I was thinking what are
your plans for tonight?

01:19:11.435 --> 01:19:15.201
Because I saw a really nice
place on my way here and

01:19:15.301 --> 01:19:17.703
we can check it out if you want to.

01:19:17.803 --> 01:19:20.302
It looked cool, really.

01:19:23.303 --> 01:19:25.971
- Nice move.
- Yeah, I know.

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.771
Thank you.

01:19:28.470 --> 01:19:30.538
- And now...
- What are you doing?

01:19:30.638 --> 01:19:33.039
Let's walk. You've been drinking.

01:19:33.271 --> 01:19:35.372
- It's OK.
- No.

01:19:35.472 --> 01:19:38.305
Come on, don't be lazy. It's really close.

01:19:38.572 --> 01:19:41.607
- It's amazing how quiet the streets are.
- Yeah.

01:19:41.707 --> 01:19:43.707
So peaceful.

01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.875
Because people stay at home,

01:19:47.975 --> 01:19:49.474
watch TV.

01:19:49.574 --> 01:19:50.641
Look out.

01:19:51.108 --> 01:19:52.976
And we are making TV.

01:19:53.076 --> 01:19:54.942
No! Vicky.

01:19:55.043 --> 01:19:56.742
We are making cinema!

01:19:56.842 --> 01:19:58.776
Oh! Alright.

01:19:58.877 --> 01:20:00.410
No, I'm not joking.

01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:03.476
This is it?

01:20:03.576 --> 01:20:06.145
- Yeah, have you been?
- No. I don't like it.

01:20:06.511 --> 01:20:09.111
Come on, let's try it out.

01:20:09.778 --> 01:20:15.211
Look I can really take you
to better places. Let's go.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:16.679
Come.

01:20:16.779 --> 01:20:20.346
I know, Danny. But still, let's
go in for one drink. Come on.

01:20:20.446 --> 01:20:22.613
- It's nice, look at it.
- Oh, yes.

01:20:22.981 --> 01:20:28.347
If you are a dwarf or elf or I
don't know. What is this place?

01:20:28.447 --> 01:20:30.181
It's like a fairy tale.

01:20:30.281 --> 01:20:33.082
How are you, my friend?
Good, huh? Everything good.

01:20:33.181 --> 01:20:36.215
Nice haircut. Very beautiful.

01:20:37.016 --> 01:20:38.616
- Very nice people.
- Yeah.

01:20:38.716 --> 01:20:39.749
All together.

01:20:39.849 --> 01:20:41.250
Yes. I like that.

01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:46.383
Let's sit here. I think this is the
perfect place. Not look at these people.

01:20:46.483 --> 01:20:47.518
OK.

01:20:48.985 --> 01:20:51.217
If you say so.

01:20:55.053 --> 01:20:56.252
What are you doing?

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:57.919
- No waiter?
- Yeah. Relax.

01:20:58.019 --> 01:21:01.953
- No menu, no waiter?
- Everything's fine. Just take a deep breath.

01:21:02.054 --> 01:21:07.654
Wait. I'm going to take a bottle of vodka.
I'm sure they will have some organic...

01:21:07.754 --> 01:21:11.089
Danny, please, relax. I'm going
to get the drinks this time.

01:21:11.188 --> 01:21:15.555
- No!
- Stop buying everything. OK? Please.

01:21:19.157 --> 01:21:21.523
She's lovely.

01:21:23.924 --> 01:21:25.290
What a dumb place, huh?

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:29.725
I think you two love it.
Especially you. Junkie.

01:21:29.825 --> 01:21:30.792
It's nice.

01:21:30.892 --> 01:21:31.792
Nice, huh?

01:21:31.892 --> 01:21:33.191
Good.

01:21:35.993 --> 01:21:37.160
Do you like it?

01:21:37.259 --> 01:21:39.259
- Ah, yeah. It's very cool.
- Ah, yeah?

01:21:39.659 --> 01:21:42.393
- Do you think you can live here?
- I mean, I think I could, if I had to.

01:21:42.493 --> 01:21:48.461
OK. So now go and park my car
somewhere here around the corner.

01:21:48.561 --> 01:21:51.162
Leave your leave your things.

01:21:51.261 --> 01:21:52.728
OK. He is going, don't worry.

01:21:52.829 --> 01:21:55.395
- Don't touch anything!
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

01:21:55.495 --> 01:21:58.897
Yeah, I'm not worried,
of course I'm not worried.

01:22:05.098 --> 01:22:07.131
Here is for the cameraman.

01:22:07.230 --> 01:22:09.431
No, no, no, no. They are not drinking.

01:22:09.531 --> 01:22:10.899
Where did Jamie go?

01:22:10.999 --> 01:22:11.999
Shitting.

01:22:12.298 --> 01:22:13.298
What?

01:22:13.398 --> 01:22:15.198
Because he could not hold it anymore.

01:22:15.432 --> 01:22:19.332
Can I have one of yours, huh? Don't worry.

01:22:21.433 --> 01:22:24.300
I just brought yours. Here.

01:22:24.867 --> 01:22:26.300
- You like it?
- No.

01:22:26.934 --> 01:22:31.435
You know, Danny, I'm very proud
of you and very happy for you.

01:22:31.535 --> 01:22:34.002
You are an intelligent guy.

01:22:34.102 --> 01:22:36.869
You could do whatever you want to.

01:22:37.103 --> 01:22:40.536
You can work on Wall Street or whatever.

01:22:41.004 --> 01:22:46.403
But instead of that you've decided
to stay and fix the things in here.

01:22:47.072 --> 01:22:48.838
And we are very privileged.

01:22:48.938 --> 01:22:55.572
We have clean water, homes,
education, food, no wars.

01:22:55.672 --> 01:22:58.873
It would be very sad if I live my life

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:01.707
- looking after my own...
- Ass.

01:23:03.573 --> 01:23:06.474
- You didn't like that but you drank it.
- I like it.

01:23:06.574 --> 01:23:08.674
Yeah? I'm going to get another one.

01:23:10.240 --> 01:23:11.608
- Are you OK?
- Sorry. Yes, I'm fine.

01:23:11.709 --> 01:23:14.942
- Oh, my goodness!
- Thank you.

01:23:16.308 --> 01:23:18.043
- You saved my life.
- No, you scared me!

01:23:18.143 --> 01:23:19.077
Look at that.

01:23:19.177 --> 01:23:20.776
Come on. I'll drive you home.

01:23:21.043 --> 01:23:25.911
- What? How did this car get here?
- It's a kind of magic, you know. Come on.

01:23:26.011 --> 01:23:27.210
No, not again.

01:23:27.510 --> 01:23:29.745
No! You've been drinking, you cannot drive.

01:23:29.845 --> 01:23:33.511
- We've walked enough for today. Get in.
- No, I mean this! Really.

01:23:33.611 --> 01:23:35.279
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious!

01:23:35.379 --> 01:23:37.546
OK. I'm not going to drive.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:43.447
The junkie will drive. Come
here, Jamie. Give me this.

01:23:43.547 --> 01:23:44.880
- He also drank.
- No.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:48.182
- Yes, he did.
- No. He ate just the pickles.

01:23:48.281 --> 01:23:51.048
- Really?
- Show her that you are not drunk.

01:23:51.148 --> 01:23:52.716
Do this balance test.

01:23:53.083 --> 01:23:54.449
Yes. Touch your nose.

01:23:54.549 --> 01:23:57.515
- Ah, you see? He is OK.
- Oh, my god. Alright.

01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:07.617
Hey, look, that's our gym
over there. It's still here.

01:24:07.718 --> 01:24:08.718
Yeah.

01:24:09.517 --> 01:24:13.919
We should go some day,
see how the coach is doing.

01:24:14.019 --> 01:24:16.351
He's doing alright.

01:24:27.921 --> 01:24:30.354
Danny, where are we going?

01:24:30.655 --> 01:24:31.755
Don't worry.

01:24:31.855 --> 01:24:33.022
I'm not worried.

01:24:33.122 --> 01:24:36.456
I'm just wondering if Jamie
understood where I live. Jamie...

01:24:36.556 --> 01:24:39.422
Yeah, he knows! No problem.

01:24:39.522 --> 01:24:41.924
He should turn right here. Are you sure?

01:24:42.024 --> 01:24:43.223
Yeah.

01:24:48.158 --> 01:24:49.458
Danny, I'm...

01:24:50.324 --> 01:24:56.358
The evening was really nice. It was
nice seeing you after so many years.

01:24:56.459 --> 01:24:59.793
You are special for me, Vicky, you know.

01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.927
You are very special.

01:25:02.693 --> 01:25:04.694
- What? Relax...
- I'm relaxed.

01:25:04.794 --> 01:25:09.061
- No, I mean, enjoy the moment...
- Well, I was enjoying it!

01:25:09.161 --> 01:25:10.195
What?

01:25:10.294 --> 01:25:11.895
Danny!

01:25:17.930 --> 01:25:19.529
Keep on driving, sound!

01:25:19.629 --> 01:25:20.429
What...

01:25:20.529 --> 01:25:22.429
I want to leave the car, Jamie. Stop it!

01:25:22.529 --> 01:25:24.731
Oh, we have a wild animal here.

01:25:24.831 --> 01:25:26.697
What are you doing?

01:25:28.031 --> 01:25:29.231
Danny!

01:25:30.832 --> 01:25:32.631
Keep on driving!

01:25:36.499 --> 01:25:39.499
Jamie, stop the fucking car!

01:25:40.834 --> 01:25:41.867
Come on.

01:25:42.533 --> 01:25:45.433
Come, open the door for me. Quickly!

01:25:45.533 --> 01:25:46.533
Now!

01:25:46.868 --> 01:25:47.935
Shut up.

01:25:48.334 --> 01:25:50.001
Don't move!

01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:57.335
A wild animal?

01:25:57.435 --> 01:25:59.369
What the fuck!

01:26:00.403 --> 01:26:02.303
Fucking bitch.

01:26:11.106 --> 01:26:12.538
Run, bitch!

01:26:12.638 --> 01:26:13.672
Run!

01:26:14.271 --> 01:26:16.072
Get in the fucking car, junkie!

01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:18.773
Get in the car, I'm driving now.

01:26:26.108 --> 01:26:28.540
I like that kind of games.

01:26:30.308 --> 01:26:32.608
She also loves it.

01:26:32.842 --> 01:26:34.809
Fucking bitch.

01:26:37.375 --> 01:26:40.275
I like that kind of games.

01:26:41.844 --> 01:26:43.777
She was wet.

01:26:43.877 --> 01:26:46.310
She was fucking wet.

01:26:49.045 --> 01:26:51.311
I'm in a good mood.

01:26:51.745 --> 01:26:53.645
She turned me on.

01:26:53.746 --> 01:26:54.779
Yeah.

01:26:55.245 --> 01:26:58.580
Are you ready for tonight, junkie?

01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:17.449
Cheers.

01:27:58.823 --> 01:28:00.590
Soundman, sit.

01:28:07.891 --> 01:28:09.024
Hey.

01:28:09.125 --> 01:28:14.458
Did you see this fucking fuck
that was sitting over here?

01:28:14.725 --> 01:28:15.892
Who?

01:28:15.992 --> 01:28:20.826
There was one fucker that was
looking at me very very bad.

01:28:22.026 --> 01:28:23.861
Very, very bad.

01:28:24.427 --> 01:28:26.393
Fucking fuck.

01:28:26.961 --> 01:28:28.194
Lazy,

01:28:28.293 --> 01:28:29.528
stupid,

01:28:29.628 --> 01:28:30.795
naive,

01:28:31.661 --> 01:28:32.795
scared.

01:28:35.163 --> 01:28:37.029
That's what they are.

01:28:39.462 --> 01:28:41.797
"Die in piss". That's
what I told them, you know.

01:28:41.897 --> 01:28:45.930
Because I know their mentality.
I know each one of them.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:50.965
I know who they are, you know?

01:28:52.331 --> 01:28:55.166
You look a little bit
nervous to me, you know.

01:28:55.632 --> 01:28:59.700
- You look nervous, why is that?
- nervous.

01:29:00.933 --> 01:29:02.266
I cannot hear you!

01:29:02.366 --> 01:29:04.366
- Do a line.
- No, thank you.

01:29:05.634 --> 01:29:10.400
Because you are stressed out
and you need to be more...

01:29:19.836 --> 01:29:21.803
We'll win

01:29:21.903 --> 01:29:22.737
Oscars!

01:29:22.837 --> 01:29:24.637
We'll win

01:29:24.737 --> 01:29:25.971
Nobel Prize.

01:29:31.239 --> 01:29:34.706
OK, don't worry, don't
worry. I'm OK. I'm OK.

01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:45.874
Like a fish, huh?

01:31:13.055 --> 01:31:15.688
It makes me sick

01:31:16.356 --> 01:31:19.389
being surrounded by idiots.

01:31:22.023 --> 01:31:24.457
They don't know nothing.

01:31:24.791 --> 01:31:30.491
Everybody is speaking
the same shit every day.

01:31:30.825 --> 01:31:34.993
They own nothing, they have no connections.

01:31:35.459 --> 01:31:38.059
What business can I do with them, huh?

01:31:56.829 --> 01:31:59.363
Fucking hell,
Jamie, what's happened?

01:31:59.463 --> 01:32:02.030
I don't know. Something is not right.

01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:06.597
They said they'll
send a doctor. Hang in there.

01:32:08.464 --> 01:32:10.098
Did you take anything yesterday?

01:32:10.198 --> 01:32:11.632
No, I didn't even drink.

01:32:11.999 --> 01:32:15.365
- And have you even slept at all? Look at you.
- Very little.

01:32:15.465 --> 01:32:17.966
I've been in bed. I bought a ticket.

01:32:18.466 --> 01:32:20.900
When did you start feeling ill?

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:22.700
I started getting cramps and

01:32:22.801 --> 01:32:26.433
I'm sweating a lot. I
feel... I am really cold.

01:32:26.534 --> 01:32:29.102
I don't know. It just keeps getting worse.

01:32:29.401 --> 01:32:31.368
Look, it's
probably all the stress.

01:32:31.468 --> 01:32:34.869
Man, I'm telling you something's not OK.

01:32:36.936 --> 01:32:40.537
Stress can do this to
you, man. There is a breaking point.

01:32:40.637 --> 01:32:41.937
No. no.

01:32:43.104 --> 01:32:44.537
It's not that.

01:32:44.970 --> 01:32:46.471
Man, we really fucked up.

01:32:46.571 --> 01:32:49.838
What do you mean we fucked up?
I mean, what you saying? What did we do?

01:32:49.938 --> 01:32:51.771
We are accomplices.

01:32:53.572 --> 01:32:55.872
You called for a doctor.

01:33:01.540 --> 01:33:04.174
What is the problem, young man?

01:33:04.275 --> 01:33:05.741
Fucking hell.

01:33:05.841 --> 01:33:08.074
Danny, this is not a joke! Look
at him. is really fucking ill.

01:33:08.175 --> 01:33:12.375
Hey, did I ask you anything,
huh? Hold this camera and shut up!

01:33:15.375 --> 01:33:17.043
Oh, my goodness!

01:33:19.110 --> 01:33:20.743
You are sweating, hm?

01:33:20.843 --> 01:33:23.011
- How do you feel?
- Leave me alone!

01:33:23.111 --> 01:33:26.544
Do you have any worries?

01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:33.578
Maybe this is all from the stress.

01:33:34.746 --> 01:33:37.646
Stress can do this to you, huh.

01:33:38.079 --> 01:33:43.480
OK, I'll call for a coffee.
I know you like your coffee.

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:46.381
No, I don't like the coffee.

01:33:47.748 --> 01:33:48.881
No?

01:33:52.081 --> 01:33:53.715
Coffee is coming.

01:33:53.816 --> 01:33:55.283
How you like it.

01:33:55.549 --> 01:33:58.383
Don't worry. We will
clean this mess for you.

01:33:58.483 --> 01:33:59.917
We are here for you.

01:34:00.017 --> 01:34:02.550
And you will be here for us.

01:34:02.650 --> 01:34:07.317
You are not going anywhere,
are you? Jamie, huh?

01:34:13.752 --> 01:34:14.785
Yes.

01:34:15.219 --> 01:34:18.686
You have work here, my boy.

01:34:18.986 --> 01:34:23.453
So call your mom, call your
boyfriend, call your dealer,

01:34:23.554 --> 01:34:27.054
tell them that you will
be back in two-three weeks.

01:34:27.154 --> 01:34:29.555
Let's say a month.

01:34:31.354 --> 01:34:33.922
That's your coffee.

01:34:39.489 --> 01:34:41.890
That's a pretty good service.

01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:47.624
No wonder this hotel
is full ten days a week.

01:34:48.292 --> 01:34:50.125
Now, open the mouth.

01:34:50.225 --> 01:34:51.691
I told you. I don't want any coffee.

01:34:51.791 --> 01:34:55.959
On the contrary. I think that's
exactly what you want. For sure.

01:34:56.425 --> 01:35:01.493
So. Imagine I'm your boyfriend and
now open the fucking mouth widely.

01:35:01.593 --> 01:35:02.860
Come on, come on, come on...

01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.828
- Mate, Danny, come on...
- Bitch, you're...

01:35:04.928 --> 01:35:08.828
Shut up! I'm trying to help him.
Hold this camera and shut the fuck up!

01:35:08.928 --> 01:35:10.229
It's not warm, come on.

01:35:10.328 --> 01:35:12.995
Hey, bitch, open your
mouth! Don't try to...

01:35:13.262 --> 01:35:17.362
I'll spill it on your face and
I'll call for another one, yes.

01:35:19.830 --> 01:35:20.896
See?

01:35:21.163 --> 01:35:24.497
Why did you have to dramatise that much?

01:35:24.597 --> 01:35:27.730
Make such a scene. Squeal like a pig.

01:35:30.765 --> 01:35:31.865
Here.

01:35:32.498 --> 01:35:34.200
How do you feel, huh?

01:35:34.532 --> 01:35:36.499
You feeling better?

01:35:36.999 --> 01:35:37.966
Do you?

01:35:38.599 --> 01:35:41.834
Do you feel your energy back, huh?

01:35:42.934 --> 01:35:44.067
Good, good, good!

01:35:44.500 --> 01:35:50.568
I'm giving you this morning off, but
I want you to be ready for one o'clock

01:35:50.668 --> 01:35:55.236
because we are going on
a safari with the godson.

01:35:57.435 --> 01:35:58.837
Junkie.

01:36:03.304 --> 01:36:04.671
What did you put in the coffee?

01:36:04.771 --> 01:36:07.337
Personally, I did not put anything.

01:36:07.604 --> 01:36:12.538
But I can assure you
that it's just the usual.

01:36:13.371 --> 01:36:16.372
Well, I mean the usual in the last

01:36:16.472 --> 01:36:19.639
two weeks, ten days, I'm not quite sure.

01:36:19.739 --> 01:36:22.540
♪ Brown sugar if you give it to me ♪

01:36:22.640 --> 01:36:24.473
What do you mean?

01:36:25.074 --> 01:36:27.540
There is no need for this tone.

01:36:27.640 --> 01:36:29.708
Don't bite the hand that feeds you.

01:36:29.808 --> 01:36:31.675
What do you mean "the last few weeks"?

01:36:31.775 --> 01:36:35.243
I mean that I have ears
everywhere, you know,

01:36:35.342 --> 01:36:38.809
and I realised you are
one of those fake friends.

01:36:39.076 --> 01:36:42.844
- Is that right, cameraman? Huh, answer!
- Yes.

01:36:42.944 --> 01:36:43.810
Yes.

01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:44.743
You see?

01:36:44.844 --> 01:36:48.911
You were unprofessional and harmful.

01:36:51.344 --> 01:36:53.545
- Is that right, cameraman?
- Yeah.

01:36:53.645 --> 01:36:56.445
You see? Cameraman agrees.

01:36:56.712 --> 01:36:57.645
So

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.013
let's not dramatise.

01:37:00.314 --> 01:37:03.780
We decided it's the best way forward

01:37:03.880 --> 01:37:07.681
so... we started to put some
heroin in your coffee, every day.

01:37:07.781 --> 01:37:13.249
It's not a big deal. A friend of mine does
it to his dealers when they are not listening.

01:37:13.782 --> 01:37:18.349
Actually, it's not that easy to
get addicted through exposure.

01:37:18.616 --> 01:37:21.217
You have to be really
weak. And the good news is

01:37:21.317 --> 01:37:24.051
that you can fight the chemical hooks

01:37:24.151 --> 01:37:30.418
through human connection and you know,
living a rich and fulfilling life.

01:37:30.518 --> 01:37:33.252
What? You want to fight?

01:37:33.351 --> 01:37:37.119
Bitch, lie down and stay here for a while.

01:37:39.519 --> 01:37:41.154
Fucking junkie.

01:37:41.254 --> 01:37:42.587
Well.

01:37:43.054 --> 01:37:44.353
Now.

01:37:48.855 --> 01:37:52.555
What... Why are you doing
this? What are you doing this...

01:37:56.388 --> 01:37:57.455
What do you mean?

01:37:57.555 --> 01:37:59.389
How can you be like this?

01:38:00.023 --> 01:38:01.556
Be a bad guy?

01:38:02.257 --> 01:38:05.091
I thought that that was the point.

01:38:05.357 --> 01:38:08.158
Otherwise it's not interesting.

01:38:08.891 --> 01:38:12.292
Some people wipe out an entire country

01:38:12.391 --> 01:38:13.592
and it's OK.

01:38:13.692 --> 01:38:15.092
They come and declare

01:38:15.192 --> 01:38:18.392
"That's my land now, my oil,
my sea, my gold, everything."

01:38:18.492 --> 01:38:19.559
And it's OK, huh?

01:38:19.659 --> 01:38:22.261
But it's not OK when I do my business?

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:25.560
And if you think I am the villain

01:38:25.660 --> 01:38:27.962
you are the dumbest of the dumb.

01:38:28.062 --> 01:38:28.962
That's what you are.

01:38:29.062 --> 01:38:31.394
Brainless, privileged trash.

01:38:31.494 --> 01:38:32.494
That's what you are.

01:38:32.595 --> 01:38:35.996
Stupid, naive, fucking lazy bitch.

01:38:36.096 --> 01:38:37.662
Don't try to preach to me, junkie!

01:38:37.762 --> 01:38:40.763
Hey, don't shake that camera
because I'll break your nose

01:38:40.864 --> 01:38:45.297
and then we start this whole
fucking scene from the beginning!

01:38:45.396 --> 01:38:46.731
Understood?

01:38:47.431 --> 01:38:49.531
I'm giving you this morning off.

01:38:49.631 --> 01:38:51.664
Get ready for one o'clock.

01:38:52.132 --> 01:38:55.832
And try not to think about
your heroin addiction.

01:38:56.532 --> 01:38:58.800
Hey, junkie, wake up!

01:39:01.033 --> 01:39:02.766
I was worried.

01:39:05.801 --> 01:39:10.069
You can hold your
microphone for three lives

01:39:10.302 --> 01:39:14.368
and still got nothing like this.

01:39:15.535 --> 01:39:18.070
Poor fucking junkie.

01:39:18.369 --> 01:39:20.970
You and Susan together.

01:41:20.257 --> 01:41:23.191
Soundman, go, go, go, go, go! Fast, go!

01:41:23.291 --> 01:41:26.790
Put your mic in the ass of the
cow. I want to hear the "Moo".

01:41:26.891 --> 01:41:29.691
Go in the field. Run. Run!

01:41:38.326 --> 01:41:39.994
Come on, cowboy!

01:42:11.065 --> 01:42:12.698
Fast, junkie!

01:42:12.798 --> 01:42:13.965
Faster!

01:42:23.268 --> 01:42:25.667
Come on, do you want a ride?

01:42:26.667 --> 01:42:29.835
There is electricity, yes? In the wire.

01:43:08.108 --> 01:43:12.842
Strong men from the street. A
little bit like the mafia, you know.

01:44:53.650 --> 01:44:57.118
Today we have a very good
funeral in our village.

01:44:57.885 --> 01:45:00.651
Now we are waiting for people.

01:45:02.584 --> 01:45:04.619
Police, everything.

01:45:06.053 --> 01:45:09.020
You want to make photo with
the... with the dead man?

01:45:18.855 --> 01:45:23.855
