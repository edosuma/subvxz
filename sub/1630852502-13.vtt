WEBVTT

00:01.871 --> 00:03.960
- Do you remember me, sir?
[honking]

00:04.003 --> 00:05.788
You have an epidural hematoma.

00:05.830 --> 00:08.704
If I don't relieve the pressure
right now, you're going to die.

00:08.747 --> 00:10.749
- We're in this together now.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.709
- Sonia Jessup. She overdosed?

00:13.752 --> 00:15.493
Am I close?
- Keep going.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.539
- I think I nicked something.
Her spleen is ruptured.

00:18.801 --> 00:20.324
The punctured spleen.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.283
With a mistake like that,
what happens next?

00:22.326 --> 00:24.241
- There'll be
an internal review.

00:24.285 --> 00:26.243
- I was the one
who inserted the tube,

00:26.287 --> 00:27.984
so if anyone deserves
the blame for it--

00:28.028 --> 00:29.638
- I was on imaging,
guiding placement.

00:29.681 --> 00:30.856
You know that.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.336
- Sir.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.513
About what happened
with the imaging...

00:35.557 --> 00:38.473
- Get back to me with
a differential on Sonja Jessup.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.214
ASAP.

00:48.004 --> 00:50.180
- When I was putting in
the chest tube,

00:50.224 --> 00:51.486
what did you notice

00:51.529 --> 00:53.140
when Dr. Bishop
was guiding placement?

00:53.183 --> 00:54.924
- Same thing you did.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.447
His first measurement was off.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.754
He misread the imaging
on the monitor...

01:00.103 --> 01:02.105
- Was it that he misread
the monitor?

01:02.149 --> 01:03.759
Or more like
he couldn't see it?

01:03.802 --> 01:08.155
- It was like it wasn't even
in his field of vision.

01:09.112 --> 01:12.159
- I know you and Dr. Bishop
are close.

01:12.202 --> 01:14.596
This is in confidence?

01:14.639 --> 01:15.945
- Of course.

01:15.988 --> 01:17.207
- About a month ago,
I noticed him

01:17.251 --> 01:20.167
treating himself for
post-concussive nausea.

01:20.210 --> 01:22.386
- That's not abnormal
after his head injury,

01:22.430 --> 01:24.432
and the surgery he had.
- I know.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.304
I'm not trying
to avoid responsibility
for what happened.

01:27.348 --> 01:30.002
I made the incision, and
I'll take the blame for it.

01:30.046 --> 01:31.265
But...

01:32.701 --> 01:34.746
But if his nausea's progressed
to vision problems,

01:34.790 --> 01:36.096
what if he's getting worse?

01:36.139 --> 01:38.359
- Yesterday, a nurse came up
with a chart.

01:38.402 --> 01:39.795
He didn't see that either.

01:39.838 --> 01:43.451
He brushed it off, I didn't
think anything about it.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.106
The question is,
is he intentionally

01:46.149 --> 01:47.237
downplaying the symptoms?

01:47.281 --> 01:49.152
- What if they caught him
by surprise?

01:49.196 --> 01:51.154
I don't know, Claire.

01:53.243 --> 01:54.723
What do we do?

01:57.247 --> 02:00.207
[theme music]

02:14.134 --> 02:16.048
- My favorite family.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.138
- Hey-hey.
- Ah!

02:18.181 --> 02:20.618
Look at you!
Come here.

02:20.662 --> 02:22.403
I know I'm not supposed
to pet him,

02:22.446 --> 02:24.274
but he's just got
the most beautiful coat.

02:24.318 --> 02:25.928
Oh yeah...
- It's cool.

02:25.971 --> 02:27.190
Thor likes you, Theo...

02:27.234 --> 02:29.105
I think it's because
you're always

02:29.149 --> 02:30.541
happier to see him than me.

02:30.585 --> 02:32.543
He's pretty good
at reading the room.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.197
[chuckling]

02:34.241 --> 02:36.460
- Well, you know the drill.
Sit on up for me.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.463
[coughing]

02:39.507 --> 02:41.291
What are you reading
these days?

02:41.335 --> 02:43.380
- This play.
[coughing]

02:44.207 --> 02:46.209
"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead."

02:46.253 --> 02:47.689
- Finn's an existentialist now.

02:47.732 --> 02:49.473
- Well, you certainly

02:49.517 --> 02:52.302
have come a long way
from "Treasure Island."

02:53.782 --> 02:55.131
Tough couple of days?

02:55.175 --> 02:56.785
- Tough couple of weeks.

02:56.828 --> 03:00.223
- He was in for pulmonary rehab
two weeks ago.

03:00.267 --> 03:03.139
- Yeah. He's barely
left the house since then.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.837
You know, we thought we were
on top of this infection, Theo.

03:05.881 --> 03:06.925
It really took a turn.

03:06.969 --> 03:08.536
- We all know that
cystic fibrosis

03:08.579 --> 03:11.930
can be... unpredictable, right?

03:11.974 --> 03:13.193
We'll check lung function,

03:13.236 --> 03:15.195
and then start you
on IV antibiotics.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.936
- What happens
if they don't work?

03:17.980 --> 03:19.982
Last time, they almost didn't.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.244
- Hey, don't think
like that, Finn.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.028
Okay? They're gonna work.

03:23.638 --> 03:25.205
- Let's start
with airway clearance.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.337
We'll loop
your respirologist in.

03:27.381 --> 03:29.818
Okay? Just, uh...
Hang in there, Finn.

03:29.861 --> 03:33.865
- I always do. Then again,
is it really even up to me?

03:33.909 --> 03:35.215
- Yes, it is.

03:35.258 --> 03:37.129
You can be
an existentialist again

03:37.173 --> 03:38.305
once we're through
this rough patch.

03:38.348 --> 03:40.568
- Sure, Mom. No problem.

03:41.395 --> 03:43.266
- Well, I'll be back soon.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.964
- Thank you.
[coughing]

03:47.270 --> 03:48.750
- I have heard of situations

03:48.793 --> 03:50.404
where the patient
has a reflex reaction

03:50.447 --> 03:52.057
just as you're placing
the chest tube.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.276
Or maybe it malforms...

03:53.320 --> 03:54.886
- Or maybe he just
made a mistake.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.192
- Maybe...

03:56.236 --> 03:58.238
Hey!

04:00.675 --> 04:02.851
You two good?
- I ended things.

04:02.894 --> 04:04.679
- What?
- I ended things.

04:04.722 --> 04:07.551
- June, I'm... If you ever want
to talk about it, I--

04:07.595 --> 04:09.292
- When do I ever want
to talk about it?

04:09.336 --> 04:10.467
- Oh, right, I know.
I'm sorry.

04:10.511 --> 04:11.599
- It's fine.
- Right, right, right.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.427
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.822
[indistinct chatter]

04:25.482 --> 04:27.092
- I'll be right back.

04:28.703 --> 04:30.313
Sir?

04:31.401 --> 04:33.490
Sir, can you hear me?

04:35.449 --> 04:37.364
Sir, open your eyes
if you can hear me.

04:37.407 --> 04:39.888
Hey, do you know
who this is?

04:39.931 --> 04:41.672
- No wristband.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.066
He must not have signed in.

04:44.109 --> 04:45.459
- He's out cold.

04:45.502 --> 04:46.721
- One too many maybe?

04:46.764 --> 04:48.592
I mean, it happens
a couple of times a week.

04:48.636 --> 04:50.638
- No, he's jaundiced. Feverish.
I think we have to get him
a room.

04:50.681 --> 04:52.292
- Yeah. Okay. I'm on it.
- Thanks.

04:52.335 --> 04:53.641
Sir?

04:55.033 --> 04:56.470
His name is Neil Evans.

04:57.166 --> 04:59.429
He's got a ruptured,
hemorrhaging mass
in his abdomen.

04:59.473 --> 05:01.083
It could be threatening
other organs.

05:01.126 --> 05:02.345
- Was he aware of it
before now?

05:02.389 --> 05:03.607
- No way of knowing.

05:03.651 --> 05:05.957
He's been unconscious
since we found him.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.568
- Any history in our system?

05:07.611 --> 05:08.960
- He had his health card.

05:09.004 --> 05:10.527
I checked for a history
and nothing came up here.

05:10.571 --> 05:12.573
We really need to stop
the bleeding.

05:12.616 --> 05:15.010
- No family we can call?
- Social worker's on it.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.534
He came in alone with just
his wallet and his keys.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.493
- Then, we rely on our judgment

05:19.536 --> 05:21.408
and sign a
two physician consent.

05:21.451 --> 05:23.366
Book the OR, category two.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.977
And yes, before you ask,
you can scrub in.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.762
Get him prepped.

05:29.024 --> 05:30.155
Tell me what's on the list

05:30.199 --> 05:31.940
and let them know we need
to go ASAP.

05:33.811 --> 05:35.204
[knocking]

05:35.247 --> 05:36.510
- Your team is working hard

05:36.553 --> 05:38.294
to help that woman
after her spleen rupture.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.905
- My team works hard to help
every patient.

05:48.043 --> 05:49.218
- Jed.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.786
I asked you
if the nausea was normal

05:51.829 --> 05:54.702
and nothing
to be concerned about.
You said yes.

05:54.745 --> 05:57.487
Then I asked you
if the dizziness was normal,
and you said yes.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.359
Now, if neither of those
were true,

05:59.402 --> 06:01.012
you have to tell me right now.

06:01.056 --> 06:04.015
Because what happened last night
in the trauma bay,

06:04.059 --> 06:05.539
Bash is now on the hook,

06:05.582 --> 06:07.105
a patient's life is at risk

06:07.149 --> 06:09.194
and if it's because you are not
taking care of yourself--

06:09.238 --> 06:10.718
- Alright, Claire! Alright!

06:17.725 --> 06:19.727
[sighing]

06:19.770 --> 06:21.163
I couldn't...

06:22.251 --> 06:24.688
I couldn't see
the damn monitor.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.997
It went foggy.

06:30.346 --> 06:32.522
- Okay, how long has this
been going on?

06:32.566 --> 06:34.524
Have symptoms been getting worse

06:34.568 --> 06:36.352
and you've just been lying
about it?

06:36.396 --> 06:37.919
- No. I haven't in...

06:38.789 --> 06:39.616
[sighs]

06:39.660 --> 06:41.531
The nausea's normal.

06:41.575 --> 06:43.403
The headaches too.
But this...

06:43.446 --> 06:44.752
These...

06:47.363 --> 06:49.931
...lapses in vision,
I wasn't expecting.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.108
I haven't been lying to you.

06:53.151 --> 06:55.415
Maybe I've been lying to myself.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.939
[soft music]

07:03.379 --> 07:05.686
- You need to call
your neurosurgeon.

07:06.774 --> 07:07.731
- I will.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.125
- And you can't see patients.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.649
[sighing]

07:16.740 --> 07:18.916
I know it's terrifying.

07:20.135 --> 07:22.616
I know your work
is your life.

07:22.659 --> 07:25.749
But you promised us a future.

07:25.793 --> 07:28.360
Did you mean it
when you did?

07:28.404 --> 07:30.188
Because I believed you.

07:30.232 --> 07:31.494
- I meant it.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.410
- Call your doctor.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.238
Seem him today.

07:42.636 --> 07:45.465
<i>[Bashir]: We're still hopeful
the rupture will heal <i>
on its own.</i></i>

07:45.508 --> 07:47.641
- Other than what happened
to her spleen,

07:47.684 --> 07:49.425
have you figured out
what's causing her symptoms?

07:49.469 --> 07:52.297
- So far, the tests we've run
haven't given us any answers.

07:52.341 --> 07:54.604
- We need your help narrowing
down the possibilities.

07:54.648 --> 07:56.867
- Can you think of anything,

07:56.911 --> 07:59.696
any symptoms or underlying
medical conditions

07:59.740 --> 08:01.306
that she's been diagnosed with?

08:01.350 --> 08:03.308
- Or any injuries
she's sustained

08:03.352 --> 08:04.571
even going back years?

08:04.614 --> 08:07.791
- Sonja and I met
when we were 18.

08:07.835 --> 08:09.532
I knew everything
there was to know about her

08:09.576 --> 08:10.664
for the longest time.

08:10.707 --> 08:11.969
She was always
basically healthy.

08:12.013 --> 08:14.319
Until her back pain,
her addiction.

08:14.363 --> 08:15.756
I love her.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.019
And I want my wife back.

08:23.024 --> 08:25.069
Joel, why don't you take
your sister

08:25.113 --> 08:27.071
to the vending machines
to get something? Okay?

08:27.115 --> 08:28.333
- Okay. Thanks, Dad.

08:28.377 --> 08:29.900
- One each, guys.
- Okay, Mom.

08:29.944 --> 08:32.903
[chuckling]
- They're adorable.

08:32.947 --> 08:34.383
- Thank you.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.688
- How are you feeling
since waking up?

08:35.732 --> 08:38.039
- Tired.
My body hurts everywhere.

08:38.082 --> 08:40.432
- The doctors need to ask you
some questions.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.825
- Sonja, we need to figure out

08:41.869 --> 08:44.001
whether you may have been
exposed to something.

08:44.044 --> 08:45.829
- You're thinking this is
something I caught?

08:45.873 --> 08:48.353
- There is an infection
called endocarditis
which could explain

08:48.397 --> 08:50.181
your symptoms.
[coughing]

08:50.225 --> 08:53.228
If there's been any, um...

08:54.011 --> 08:56.536
...well, any intravenous
drug use, even months ago.

08:56.579 --> 08:58.015
- You think I was shooting up?

08:58.059 --> 09:00.235
- No, we're--
- I would never do that.

09:01.236 --> 09:02.672
I know I messed up yesterday,

09:02.716 --> 09:04.500
but I was only taking pills.

09:04.544 --> 09:06.023
- How long have you had these?

09:06.067 --> 09:08.678
Spider veins on your leg?
- Years. Ten years, at least.

09:08.722 --> 09:11.289
My GP said they're nothing
to worry about. You...

09:11.333 --> 09:12.769
You believe me, right?

09:12.813 --> 09:15.903
[coughing]
- What is happening to her?!

09:15.946 --> 09:17.426
[beeping]

09:17.469 --> 09:18.688
- Put your head back.

09:18.732 --> 09:21.082
Put your head back.
Just stay there.

09:23.432 --> 09:25.913
- No closer to finding anyone
who knows this man?

09:25.956 --> 09:27.828
- Viv was able to reach his GP.

09:27.871 --> 09:29.743
But no spouse and no kids.

09:33.529 --> 09:35.313
Jesus.

09:35.357 --> 09:38.316
- Ah, this tumour
has more legs than a spider.

09:38.360 --> 09:40.754
- It's wrapped
around his liver.

09:42.016 --> 09:44.322
It's encroaching on his pancreas

09:44.366 --> 09:45.802
and it's stuck to his bowel.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.543
Have you ever seen anything
like this before?

09:47.587 --> 09:49.414
- Ah, it's in the lining
of his abdomen,

09:49.458 --> 09:51.765
could be colorectal cancer

09:51.808 --> 09:55.333
or malignant mesothelioma.
- So what do we do?

09:55.377 --> 09:58.641
- Unfortunately, there's
not much we can do, Dr. Curtis,

09:58.685 --> 10:02.384
other than divert
and refer oncology.

10:03.428 --> 10:05.605
He's lucky if he has a week.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.476
Let's close up.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.089
- Sonja's intubated.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.743
Anything back from her CT?

10:13.787 --> 10:14.875
- Still waiting.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.838
- They met so young.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.362
You could end up being married
to someone who isn't anything

10:24.406 --> 10:26.538
like the person
they started out as.

10:26.582 --> 10:29.411
- Or it just means
that you change together.

10:30.151 --> 10:32.109
My parents met at 18

10:32.153 --> 10:36.244
and they were more in love
than any couple I've ever seen.

10:37.071 --> 10:38.899
Results are up.

10:42.163 --> 10:44.556
- Her spleen
won't stop bleeding.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.558
The blood's filling up
her abdomen.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.038
- We've caused too much damage.

10:48.082 --> 10:49.910
They're going to have
to remove it.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.393
[machine humming]

11:04.228 --> 11:06.927
[coughing]

11:12.454 --> 11:15.283
- I bet I'm the only kid
you know

11:15.326 --> 11:18.765
with a legitimate reason
to dress up like his dog?

11:21.593 --> 11:22.899
- The X-rays came back.

11:22.943 --> 11:25.554
Unfortunately, the last few days

11:25.597 --> 11:27.904
took their toll
on Finn's lungs.

11:27.948 --> 11:30.777
I know that's not something
you want to hear right now.

11:30.820 --> 11:33.867
- I'm not responding
to the antibiotics?

11:33.910 --> 11:36.957
- Your infection's
getting worse. Pneumonia.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.610
We're admitting you now.

11:38.654 --> 11:40.569
Your CF team
is on their way down.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.050
But, um... we're not gonna
be able to stop it.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.749
- The vest didn't help?

11:46.793 --> 11:48.011
- What about PEP?

11:48.055 --> 11:49.534
Or a bi-pap?

11:49.578 --> 11:52.320
[coughing]
- Those would buy time.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.323
But it wouldn't stop
the decompensation.

11:55.366 --> 11:58.500
I'm... I'm so sorry.

11:59.806 --> 12:01.285
- Okay.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.897
Okay. We're prepared
for this. Right?

12:03.940 --> 12:05.463
- We've been on the transplant
list for months.

12:05.507 --> 12:08.379
- And this moves Finn
up to the top, right?

12:09.380 --> 12:11.513
- The list is based
on need, yeah.

12:11.556 --> 12:14.472
- It doesn't matter
because it's too late.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.778
- Finn!
Don't say that!

12:15.822 --> 12:17.737
- Hey, that is not
what's happening here, okay.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.477
There are more things
that we can try.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.784
- I know you guys are trying
to protect me. I get that.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.482
But I need to face
what's really going on here,

12:24.526 --> 12:26.789
and I don't think you're hearing

12:26.833 --> 12:28.791
what Theo's actually
saying to us.

12:32.186 --> 12:33.709
- Even if lungs come,

12:35.450 --> 12:37.669
your infection
is too advanced.

12:39.584 --> 12:41.412
He wouldn't be a candidate.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.459
We, uh...

12:45.895 --> 12:47.375
We're...

12:48.202 --> 12:49.725
We're looking at end stage.

12:51.683 --> 12:53.555
[moaning]

12:55.122 --> 12:56.776
[crying]

13:02.477 --> 13:05.393
- I'm sorry, Mom.
- No.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.048
- Okay.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.495
- What happened?

13:21.757 --> 13:23.280
- They were prepping
for her splenectomy

13:23.324 --> 13:24.542
when she started to seize.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.893
- She seized? Why?

13:26.936 --> 13:28.677
- We don't know.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.549
Well, we've stabilized her,

13:31.593 --> 13:33.856
but, uh...
they can't remove the organ

13:33.900 --> 13:36.032
until we know what else
we're dealing with.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.080
<i>[knocking]
[Bishop]: Yes, come in.</i>

13:40.123 --> 13:41.864
Is this about Sonja Jessup?

13:41.908 --> 13:44.084
- Every time we think
we're making progress,

13:44.127 --> 13:45.825
she seems to be getting worse.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.916
[sighing]
- Take me through your thinking.

13:51.918 --> 13:54.921
- All of her symptoms.
The fluid around her heart.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.574
The fluid on her lungs.

13:56.618 --> 13:58.707
We can't see
how they're connected.

13:58.750 --> 14:00.883
She's negative
for respiratory virus,

14:00.927 --> 14:02.624
and her white blood cells
are normal,

14:02.667 --> 14:04.931
which means there's not
an infection either.

14:04.974 --> 14:07.542
The fact is she's been here
two days

14:07.585 --> 14:08.891
and we still don't know
what's wrong with her.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.024
- Other than the ruptured
spleen, which we caused.

14:11.067 --> 14:14.462
And before we could repair that,
the seizure.

14:15.811 --> 14:18.422
- Basically, all we know
is that she's extremely ill,

14:18.466 --> 14:19.989
and her prognosis is worsening

14:20.033 --> 14:21.773
because of what happened
in Trauma last night.

14:21.817 --> 14:23.775
- Which was my mistake.

14:23.819 --> 14:26.256
And I'll tell that to the board.
Thank you.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.128
- Sir, I'm not going to let you
take responsibility--

14:28.171 --> 14:29.564
- It was my fault.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.000
And I'm not having you
come this far

14:31.044 --> 14:33.481
for something like this
to hold you back.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.528
Now, clear your mind,
widen your views.

14:37.572 --> 14:40.140
List everything
that it can't be

14:40.183 --> 14:42.142
until you see what it is.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.930
There's poetry
in the differential.
There's truth.

14:47.974 --> 14:51.760
We get it wrong until...
we get it right.

14:51.803 --> 14:53.675
And they get to start over.

14:59.202 --> 15:00.334
[groaning]

15:00.377 --> 15:01.944
- Sir?

15:02.771 --> 15:05.513
[Bishop groaning]
Dr. Bishop?

15:07.123 --> 15:09.386
[groaning]

15:09.430 --> 15:12.128
[stuttering]: My numb is arm.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.825
- Sir?

15:13.869 --> 15:15.871
Dr. Bishop?

15:16.524 --> 15:18.004
Get a gurney!
Call a code!

15:20.006 --> 15:23.226
[panting]

15:23.270 --> 15:25.925
[muffled chatter]

15:27.970 --> 15:30.146
[panting]

15:30.190 --> 15:32.932
[muffled gunfire]

15:38.111 --> 15:41.941
[panting]

15:43.594 --> 15:46.336
Sir! Dr. Bishop,
can you hear me?

15:46.380 --> 15:48.948
[panting]

15:52.908 --> 15:54.388
- Oh my God! Jed?

15:54.431 --> 15:57.391
- Possible stroke! He collapsed,
and then lost his pulse.

15:59.871 --> 16:03.223
[panting]

16:05.355 --> 16:07.227
[indistinct]
- Pause the compression.

16:07.270 --> 16:08.837
- V-tach on the monitor.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.057
Defibing 200 joules.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.801
- Pads are on.
- Charging!

16:16.845 --> 16:18.151
- What happened?

16:18.194 --> 16:19.456
- Everyone clear!

16:19.500 --> 16:21.415
[beeping]

16:22.894 --> 16:25.114
- One amp epi! IV push!

16:25.158 --> 16:26.507
- Bash, you were with him?
What happened?

16:26.550 --> 16:28.988
- He said his arm was numb
and he just collapsed.

16:29.031 --> 16:31.120
- Ischemic stroke?
- Or hemorrhagic.

16:31.164 --> 16:33.166
- Could be a ruptured aneurysm.

16:33.209 --> 16:34.602
- A ruptured aneurysm
causing cardiac arrest?

16:34.645 --> 16:36.169
How long has this thing
been building?

16:36.212 --> 16:38.693
- We need Neurosurgery
in here right away!

16:38.736 --> 16:40.173
Let's do a pulse check.

16:40.216 --> 16:42.479
- He's still in V-tach.

16:42.523 --> 16:43.698
- Defib!

16:43.741 --> 16:46.309
200! Charging!

16:46.353 --> 16:49.312
[beeping]
Everyone clear!

16:55.101 --> 16:57.538
[heart monitor beeping]

16:57.581 --> 17:00.367
- Dr. Bishop? Sir!

17:00.410 --> 17:01.759
- Jed!

17:01.803 --> 17:03.892
- GCS still three.
- He was down almost a minute.

17:03.935 --> 17:06.199
- We need to intubate him
and get him to CT right away.

17:06.242 --> 17:08.156
- Okay, he needs
anti-convulsants,

17:08.201 --> 17:10.116
we need manitol to decrease
cranial pressure.

17:10.159 --> 17:11.464
Let's get him
on three per cent saline.

17:11.508 --> 17:12.901
And minimize damage
as best as we can.

17:12.944 --> 17:14.381
- What happened?

17:14.424 --> 17:16.992
- Sudden loss of consciousness,
he went into V-tach

17:17.036 --> 17:18.863
and we shocked him back
to normal rhythm.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.566
- Did he articulate
any symptoms first?

17:25.608 --> 17:26.741
- Numbness.

17:26.784 --> 17:28.612
- And momentary vision loss,

17:28.656 --> 17:30.092
he suffered last night.

17:30.136 --> 17:31.746
- He called my office.

17:31.789 --> 17:33.704
- We have a consultation
booked for tomorrow.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.315
We'll get him upstairs.

17:47.109 --> 17:48.458
- Listen.

17:49.807 --> 17:51.505
I know that wasn't easy.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.550
But he's out of our hands now.

17:53.594 --> 17:57.859
And we know exactly
what he'd tell us to do:

17:57.902 --> 17:59.600
to get to work

17:59.643 --> 18:03.125
and focus on the patients
we can help.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.301
Let's get to work.

18:12.743 --> 18:16.530
[dramatic music]

18:19.185 --> 18:21.187
- Sonja needs us.

18:39.248 --> 18:43.513
[muffled gunfire]

18:49.737 --> 18:52.783
- Get him prepped!
He needs a craniotomy
to drain the blood.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.528
- Tell me how bad it is.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.315
- We won't know
until after, but...

19:02.358 --> 19:05.318
There's no guarantee
he comes back from this, Claire.

19:17.634 --> 19:20.333
- Okay, um...
Well, let's go back
to the beginning.

19:20.376 --> 19:22.291
So, Sonja was
in a car accident.

19:22.335 --> 19:24.772
But you wanted
to rule out a brain injury.

19:24.815 --> 19:27.166
- No visible head trauma.
Her resp rate was low

19:27.209 --> 19:29.037
which I mistook for symptoms
of opioid use,

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
and then, heart and lung fluid

19:30.604 --> 19:32.040
almost killed her
later that day.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.260
- Her drug use raised
the possibility of endocarditis,

19:34.303 --> 19:36.262
but she said she wasn't
using intravenously.

19:36.305 --> 19:37.872
- Which was confirmed
by bacterial culture.

19:37.915 --> 19:40.179
Also, the CT scan of
Sonja's head came back clear,

19:40.222 --> 19:41.484
so we know it's not
a brain injury...

19:41.528 --> 19:43.660
- Which leads us back
to an underlying cause.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.401
[sighing]

19:46.968 --> 19:50.232
- It needs to be something
physiologic. Sonja.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.017
- An abnormality
we're not seeing...

19:53.061 --> 19:56.325
- Something rare...
Something you wouldn't normally
think to look for...

20:02.810 --> 20:06.553
There have been cases
where a penetrating head trauma

20:06.596 --> 20:09.599
can cause an aneurysm months,
even years, down the road.

20:10.252 --> 20:12.385
I could've caused this...
Dr. Bishop's...

20:12.428 --> 20:13.908
- With the drill, you mean?

20:13.951 --> 20:15.910
- You told me it was reckless
to drill without imaging.

20:15.953 --> 20:17.172
- Bash.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.696
- You saved his life
because you did that.

20:20.915 --> 20:23.047
And there could be
so many reasons this happened,

20:23.091 --> 20:25.485
not the least of which
is Bishop going back to work

20:25.528 --> 20:27.443
so soon after his accident...

20:28.357 --> 20:31.969
- And the aneurysm could've
sat there for months.

20:32.013 --> 20:34.015
A ticking time bomb in his head.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.412
- Telangiectasia.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.983
The... the spider veins
on Sonja's leg?

20:46.027 --> 20:49.160
- Those almost always mean
nothing. What are you thinking?

20:49.204 --> 20:51.859
- You said something rare,
something that you wouldn't
normally think to look for,

20:51.902 --> 20:53.687
and you also said
a ticking time bomb...

20:54.688 --> 20:56.124
- You know what's wrong
with her?

20:56.167 --> 20:57.778
- I have a theory,
but we're gonna need

20:57.821 --> 20:59.301
more imaging to confirm.

21:11.879 --> 21:13.533
- Hey, Theo.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.102
- Hi, Finn.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.496
I, uh...

21:21.932 --> 21:23.325
I heard you're going home.

21:23.369 --> 21:26.676
- They're setting us up
with everything we need.

21:28.678 --> 21:30.854
And Thor likes it better there.

21:32.595 --> 21:34.684
- So they're doing this
for him, then?

21:35.685 --> 21:38.645
- I needed a say
in how it happens.

21:41.387 --> 21:43.824
I'm scared, Theo.

21:48.394 --> 21:49.699
- I know, Finn.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.356
It's okay to be scared.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.793
[soft music]

22:16.596 --> 22:19.729
- Thank you for everything,
Theo.

22:20.904 --> 22:22.166
- He's, uh...

22:23.080 --> 22:24.691
He's a brave kid.

22:26.432 --> 22:28.347
An amazing kid.

22:28.390 --> 22:30.392
- I can't do this.

22:31.088 --> 22:33.047
I can't do this.
- It's okay.

22:47.931 --> 22:49.585
<i>[June]:
"The pancreas is an ass."</i>

22:49.629 --> 22:52.458
- But also kind of important.
- Yeah. Who said that?

22:52.501 --> 22:54.895
I remember someone saying that.
I can't remember who it was.
- Dr. Waldon.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.376
He did a three-hour
oncology lecture last year.

22:57.419 --> 23:01.075
"The pancreas is an ass,
which is why it deserves
more of our attention."

23:01.118 --> 23:02.424
- Right. Yeah.
- Why?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.426
- Well, it's a highly aggressive
abdominal tumour.

23:04.470 --> 23:05.906
It's compromising
the other organs.

23:05.949 --> 23:07.690
I was thinking
an intraperitoneal chemotherapy.

23:07.734 --> 23:10.171
- You're gonna surgically
deliver chemo

23:10.214 --> 23:11.390
right to his cancer cells?

23:11.433 --> 23:12.739
- Well, not me,
but I was thinking

23:12.782 --> 23:14.610
maybe someone
like Doctor Waldon could.

23:14.654 --> 23:16.786
He'd have to debulk most
of the cancer cells first.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.527
Possibly resect
part of the bowel,

23:18.571 --> 23:20.355
and take the tail
of the pancreas.
I don't know, but...

23:20.399 --> 23:22.836
- Singh asked you
to organize that?

23:22.879 --> 23:24.620
- Well,
he said to refer Oncology.

23:24.664 --> 23:27.449
- Pulling together an advanced
procedure like that

23:27.493 --> 23:28.842
at the eleventh hour,

23:28.885 --> 23:30.800
I don't think anyone here
is even trained for it.

23:30.844 --> 23:31.975
- Yeah.

23:34.151 --> 23:36.153
The patient's completely alone.

23:36.980 --> 23:38.939
Like he doesn't have anyone
to advocate for him.

23:38.982 --> 23:40.810
I don't know what he did
to end up like this,

23:40.854 --> 23:42.986
but anything we can do
to help with...

23:43.857 --> 23:45.815
Anything we can do to help.

23:46.729 --> 23:48.557
- You know who you could call...

23:48.601 --> 23:50.472
Dr. Magnussen at Sunnybrook.

23:50.516 --> 23:53.388
She just published
on that kind of thing last year.

23:53.432 --> 23:55.172
Maybe she's looking
for candidates.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.916
- Yeah.
Yeah, thank you.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.837
- You saw the radiologist?
- You were right.

24:08.882 --> 24:11.798
- An "AVM?"
- "Arteriovenous malformation."

24:11.841 --> 24:13.321
It's a rare, abnormal connection

24:13.364 --> 24:14.931
between a person's
arteries and veins.

24:14.975 --> 24:17.325
- Then this had nothing to do
with her drug use?

24:17.368 --> 24:19.283
- She was probably
born with them.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.242
AVMs disrupt circulation

24:21.285 --> 24:23.549
and can cause a range
of life-threatening symptoms.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.724
- They can happen anywhere.

24:24.767 --> 24:26.987
In Sonja's case,
we identified one

24:27.030 --> 24:28.945
in her lungs
and one on her spine,

24:28.989 --> 24:31.513
but it's the kind of thing
you don't even know to look for

24:31.557 --> 24:33.297
until the other symptoms
develop.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.996
- She's gonna need
a surgical procedure
called an embolization.

24:36.039 --> 24:39.695
- But you said she's got
one of these things
on her spine?

24:40.696 --> 24:42.872
- Could it have caused her
back pain in the first place?

24:42.916 --> 24:44.395
- It's possible.
Even likely.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.832
- You couldn't have known.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.530
- Yeah, but I stopped
believing in her.

24:48.574 --> 24:50.532
I stopped trusting her.

24:50.576 --> 24:53.404
- Her condition is serious,
but it is treatable.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.189
- The surgery will last
a few hours.

24:55.232 --> 24:57.104
If you need some time
to take your children home,

24:57.147 --> 24:58.453
we'll call you after.

24:58.497 --> 24:59.628
- We're not going anywhere.

24:59.672 --> 25:03.502
[pagers beeping]
Is that for her?

25:03.545 --> 25:04.764
- Wait here.

25:10.117 --> 25:12.511
- BP's tanking,
she's tachycardic.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.903
- Ultrasound. Mags?
- Yeah.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.949
- How many times
can one woman crash?

25:15.992 --> 25:17.472
Where are you on this patient?

25:17.516 --> 25:18.908
- She's got multiple AVMs.

25:18.952 --> 25:21.345
We can embolize them,
but she's not stable enough.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.004
She's got blood
from her spleen in her abdomen.

25:28.048 --> 25:29.136
Call OR.
- Yeah.

25:29.179 --> 25:30.790
- She's going into
hemorrhagic shock.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.053
She needs her spleen out stat.
We can't lose her now.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.533
We finally know
what's wrong with her.

25:34.576 --> 25:36.491
And if she bleeds out
because we punctured her spleen,

25:36.535 --> 25:38.624
then Dr. Bishop--
- Is on the line.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.584
- The OR says ten.
- She may not have ten.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.717
- Then we do it ourselves.
In trauma.

25:44.760 --> 25:46.545
You've removed
a spleen before, right?

25:46.588 --> 25:47.937
- Mm-hmm.

25:48.634 --> 25:51.114
- Well, what are we waiting for?

26:00.994 --> 26:03.387
- I'm ready. We're starting.

26:03.431 --> 26:04.519
Scalpel.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.616
- BP's dropping. Activate MTP.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.096
- Arnold,
get the level one ready.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.968
- Got it.
- Mags, help me open?

26:20.448 --> 26:22.450
- Hanging two packs of red cells
and two bags of plasma.

26:22.493 --> 26:24.757
- She's got a significant amount
of blood in her abdomen.

26:24.800 --> 26:26.323
I'm gonna need packs,
and a lot of them.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.498
- Richardson.

26:31.111 --> 26:32.503
Metz.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.596
[indistinct]

26:44.167 --> 26:45.865
I'll eviscerate the bowel

26:45.908 --> 26:47.649
so we can start
packing the abdomen.

26:48.389 --> 26:51.174
Start packing
and keep them coming.

27:00.575 --> 27:02.969
- Pressures dropping!
- Clamp.

27:06.537 --> 27:08.278
- I've got you.

27:27.080 --> 27:28.777
- It's impressive you were able

27:28.821 --> 27:29.952
to pull this together
so quickly.

27:29.996 --> 27:32.172
Magnussen's not making
any promises,

27:32.215 --> 27:34.217
but she thinks
he's a viable candidate.

27:34.261 --> 27:37.917
But you should know she brought
a full team here with her.

27:37.960 --> 27:40.267
So that means, you--
- Yeah. I know.

27:40.310 --> 27:41.877
I'm not asking to scrub in.

27:41.921 --> 27:43.705
I just wanted to give the guy
a chance. So...

27:43.749 --> 27:45.228
- Ah.

27:48.318 --> 27:49.668
[sighing]

28:00.766 --> 28:02.550
[knocking]

28:15.650 --> 28:17.391
- Sonja's stable.

28:18.653 --> 28:22.265
We figured out
what was wrong with her
just in time.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.442
- But not him.

28:31.187 --> 28:33.537
- I knew he still had symptoms.

28:33.581 --> 28:35.496
- Oh, Bash.

28:36.497 --> 28:38.238
- I could've said something
earlier.

28:38.281 --> 28:40.022
No, I could've stopped this
from happening.

28:40.066 --> 28:42.155
- Don't blame yourself.
Don't do that. Come here.

29:29.855 --> 29:33.249
<i>[muffled gunfire]</i>

29:46.567 --> 29:49.613
[beeping]

29:49.657 --> 29:51.746
[gunfire in the distance]

30:04.715 --> 30:06.326
- Baba.

30:06.369 --> 30:08.545
[beeping]

30:11.374 --> 30:12.680
Baba!

30:12.723 --> 30:16.858
[panting]

30:16.902 --> 30:19.469
[groaning]
Baba!

30:24.518 --> 30:26.389
[in Arabic]:

30:37.705 --> 30:39.838
[indistinct]

30:54.504 --> 30:56.811
[groaning]

31:12.218 --> 31:15.830
[indistinct chatter]

31:15.874 --> 31:19.616
[dramatic music]

31:39.985 --> 31:41.682
- I had to go.

31:44.250 --> 31:46.339
I had to leave him.

31:50.343 --> 31:54.390
If I'd stayed to treat him,
they would've found us.

31:55.565 --> 31:58.438
If I tried to move him,
they would've heard us.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.489
So I left him there to die.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.581
It's my fault.

32:13.192 --> 32:16.891
[crying]
It's all my fault.

32:23.506 --> 32:26.466
[crying]

33:09.770 --> 33:11.119
- How's Dr. Bishop?

33:11.163 --> 33:12.120
- Conscious.

33:12.164 --> 33:14.166
I mean,
we can't really tell.

33:14.209 --> 33:17.169
- I know how much he means
to all of you.

33:17.212 --> 33:19.345
- Yeah, thanks.

33:19.388 --> 33:21.869
- Well, I'll see you.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.613
- Hi.
I heard you were awake.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.877
- Apparently, without a spleen,
thanks to you.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.705
- You can live without one.

33:31.748 --> 33:33.837
You'll just be more prone
to infections,

33:33.881 --> 33:36.405
but you can take measures
to mitigate that.

33:36.449 --> 33:38.233
- You saved my life.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.194
And you found the reason
for my back pain.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.763
I know I'll always
be an addict.

33:49.723 --> 33:52.073
- That doesn't mean
you can't start over.

33:52.117 --> 33:54.075
- And that's all I want to do.

33:54.119 --> 33:56.164
Beat this thing,
for my family.

33:58.862 --> 34:03.084
[soft music]

34:08.784 --> 34:10.222
- Is everything okay?

34:10.264 --> 34:13.051
Your text said to come,
but you didn't say why.

34:14.878 --> 34:16.793
- Amira, what I said yesterday,

34:16.837 --> 34:19.318
about only being in this country
because of you...

34:20.536 --> 34:21.755
I'm sorry.

34:21.797 --> 34:24.409
I didn't mean it
like it sounded, but...

34:25.280 --> 34:28.283
You deserve to know
why I said it.

34:31.069 --> 34:33.245
I don't bring you here enough.

34:34.811 --> 34:36.117
Back home, do you remember

34:36.161 --> 34:38.119
coming to the clinic
after school?

34:38.989 --> 34:41.731
Baba would always talk about
what he'd learned that day.

34:41.775 --> 34:43.994
New medications
and treatments.

34:44.038 --> 34:46.127
No problem was ever
too big and...

34:46.170 --> 34:48.129
Mama always talked
about her patients.

34:48.172 --> 34:52.132
Learn how to treat the patients,
and not the symptoms.

34:55.310 --> 34:57.138
Amira...

34:59.314 --> 35:03.275
You know, when you were sent
to live with the cousins...

35:05.190 --> 35:08.976
...that was only
because of how much Mama
and Baba loved you.

35:09.019 --> 35:12.545
How much they wanted
to protect you from the war.

35:15.591 --> 35:17.637
I know you miss them.

35:17.680 --> 35:19.595
I miss them too.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.164
And you were right
when you said yesterday

35:23.208 --> 35:25.340
that I'm not honest with you.

35:25.949 --> 35:27.864
But I want to be.

35:31.868 --> 35:35.002
You've asked me why
I can't talk about them.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.575
That day,

35:42.618 --> 35:45.143
when the bombs came...

35:49.277 --> 35:50.496
I wasn't there.

35:52.889 --> 35:55.196
I was too late
to save them.

35:55.240 --> 35:58.373
And I feel guilty about that
every day

35:58.417 --> 36:00.767
because you lost them
and you need them,

36:00.810 --> 36:02.943
and we're alone because of me.

36:06.251 --> 36:08.949
But the last thing
our father told me

36:08.992 --> 36:11.169
was to find you,

36:11.995 --> 36:14.346
and build a future
for both of us.

36:15.912 --> 36:19.220
Because we weren't alone
if we had each other.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.358
I know you need me
to be better.

36:26.401 --> 36:27.620
To do better.

36:27.663 --> 36:29.883
And I'm learning as I go.

36:29.926 --> 36:33.278
But, habibi, I promise,
I'm here for you.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.586
["I love you" in Arabic]

36:39.936 --> 36:41.416
- Baba was right.

36:42.504 --> 36:44.680
When you came to the camp,

36:44.724 --> 36:46.552
when you found me,

36:46.595 --> 36:48.641
I knew I was safe.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.686
You saved me.

36:50.730 --> 36:53.211
We're not alone because of you.

36:53.254 --> 36:55.691
We're together because of you.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.421
- Theo?

37:30.509 --> 37:31.727
What are you doing here?

37:31.771 --> 37:33.207
I thought you were
working all week?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.513
- I, uh...

37:34.556 --> 37:37.037
I was just at the hospital
an hour ago,

37:37.080 --> 37:39.866
and I'll be catching a flight
first thing in the morning.

37:39.909 --> 37:40.910
I just...

37:42.521 --> 37:44.174
I had to see you.

37:45.915 --> 37:47.830
And see the girls.

37:47.874 --> 37:49.919
Life is...

37:51.269 --> 37:52.748
It's impossible.

37:53.314 --> 37:56.012
It's impossible
and I know I screwed up.

37:56.056 --> 37:58.667
Taking the job
without telling you is...

37:58.711 --> 38:01.757
I just, I wanted to take control
of my own life.

38:02.454 --> 38:04.456
You know, not just have it
happen to me.

38:04.499 --> 38:05.979
I wanted...

38:06.022 --> 38:09.156
I just, I went about it
the wrong way. And I'm sorry.

38:09.199 --> 38:11.854
I hurt you,
and I am so sorry.

38:13.987 --> 38:15.945
Mel, I love you.

38:19.079 --> 38:21.995
- But if we want
different things,
is that enough?

38:23.866 --> 38:25.520
- It has to be.

38:27.957 --> 38:32.832
It has to be because
I can't imagine life
without my family.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.976
- What are we gonna do?

38:52.068 --> 38:53.635
- I don't know.

39:05.212 --> 39:06.779
- They're closing up.

39:07.432 --> 39:09.608
No guarantees, but...

39:09.651 --> 39:11.566
that guy's got a shot
because of you.

39:11.610 --> 39:13.568
- Yeah, this might be
the first time

39:13.612 --> 39:15.614
I actually wished
my patient was awake.

39:15.657 --> 39:17.877
- Spoken like a true surgeon.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.182
Walk with me.

39:20.140 --> 39:23.143
You're almost
in your fourth year, June.

39:23.186 --> 39:27.060
You should consider applying for
the Chief Resident position.

39:27.103 --> 39:28.453
- Sir?

39:28.496 --> 39:31.630
- And don't get me wrong,
it's a thankless job.

39:31.673 --> 39:34.459
Longer hours.
Administrative crap.

39:34.502 --> 39:36.983
Managing your peers
without any real power.

39:37.026 --> 39:39.638
And you'll be up against
a bunch of egocentric bros

39:39.681 --> 39:41.509
who think they've got it
in the bag.

39:41.553 --> 39:43.642
But it'll open doors.

39:43.685 --> 39:46.209
Going above and beyond
for the sole purpose

39:46.253 --> 39:48.864
of giving that patient
a chance?

39:49.604 --> 39:51.519
That's something
you can't teach.

39:51.563 --> 39:55.218
And it's what I've been waiting
to see from you.

39:57.046 --> 39:58.352
- Thanks.

39:58.396 --> 40:00.485
I mean, I'll consider it.

40:00.528 --> 40:02.617
- You do that.

40:07.448 --> 40:10.799
- You okay?
- Yeah, actually.

40:11.844 --> 40:12.845
You?

40:12.888 --> 40:16.239
- Uh, I...
I don't know.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.723
You know, it was Bishop
who told me

40:21.767 --> 40:23.377
that if I wasn't careful,

40:23.421 --> 40:25.292
this place
would swallow me whole.

40:25.335 --> 40:28.469
But if even he can't stop that
from happening...

40:28.513 --> 40:30.732
- Then what chance
do any of us have?

40:32.386 --> 40:33.735
Look.

40:34.780 --> 40:36.782
You don't strike me as someone

40:36.825 --> 40:39.001
who would back down
from a challenge.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.699
Just saying.

40:48.750 --> 40:51.579
- Hey. I'm glad you came.

40:51.623 --> 40:53.407
- I'm glad you called.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.930
- This way.

41:03.852 --> 41:06.115
I'll be just outside
if you need me.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.082
- Hi, Dad.

41:22.915 --> 41:25.265
- Has he said anything yet?

41:25.308 --> 41:26.875
- Not yet.

41:30.183 --> 41:32.794
- He's lucky to have you
in his life.

41:36.537 --> 41:38.147
- You too.

42:01.649 --> 42:04.957
[soft music]

42:34.464 --> 42:38.860
[in Arabic]:

42:59.664 --> 43:01.883
- I thought you were dead.
