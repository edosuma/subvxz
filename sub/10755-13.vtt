WEBVTT

00:09.558 --> 00:13.570
Well, we've got about thirty seconds. I think we've got time for one quick call.

00:13.570 --> 00:15.772
Hello, Marlene, I'm listening.

00:15.772 --> 00:17.188
Oh my God, I'm really on?

00:17.188 --> 00:18.500
Yes, your problem, please...

00:18.500 --> 00:21.231
Lucky, Lucky, get down.  George, get the dog!

00:21.231 --> 00:23.542
Oh my God, this is so exciting!

00:23.542 --> 00:26.462
Honey, honey, get the baby.  George, get your son!

00:26.462 --> 00:28.388
OK, OK, here it is, Dr. Crane:

00:28.388 --> 00:30.820
if my husband and I don't find some time to have sex soon,

00:30.820 --> 00:35.130
I think I'm gonna burst.  I may even have to go to a department store and pick up a stranger.

00:35.130 --> 00:40.060
Oh, kids!  Look who's here without calling first, Nana and Pop Pop!

00:40.060 --> 00:43.779
I'll call you back.

00:43.779 --> 00:48.889
Well, to all you Marlenes out there, may I suggest that sex with a stranger is not the answer.

00:48.889 --> 00:51.811
Why don't you just pack the kids off with Nana and Pop Pop,

00:51.811 --> 00:56.258
lock Lucky downstairs in the basement, grab your husband, take him to the sturdiest kitchen table you have,

00:56.258 --> 01:01.113
and let the postman ring twice!

01:01.113 --> 01:03.800
Now, to the rest of my listeners, I'll be off on vacation for the next week,

01:03.800 --> 01:08.719
so please tune in to my replacement,
the noted podiatrist, Dr Garreth Wooten,

01:08.719 --> 01:12.572
who'll be discussing the virtues of his new book, "Bunions and Blisters and Corns,"

01:12.572 --> 01:14.653
Oh My!

01:16.152 --> 01:19.963
I hate it when that weird foot freak subs for you.

01:19.963 --> 01:21.896
Couldn't you just have Frederick come and visit you here?

01:21.896 --> 01:25.960
Sorry Roz, the taxi's waiting outside to take me to the airport.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.017
Oh well, have a great time. 
Oh, thanks.

01:28.017 --> 01:29.932
And don't forget to bring me a present!

01:29.932 --> 01:32.679
I'll get you a nice T-shirt from Colonial Williamsburg.

01:32.679 --> 01:34.890
You're taking Frederick to Williamsburg?

01:34.890 --> 01:37.355
Eeew!

01:37.355 --> 01:42.393
No, it's a wonderful vacation spot!  We're going to dip candles, tan leather, churn butter...

01:42.393 --> 01:44.887
Hey, Frederick Crane, you just finished the first grade,

01:44.887 --> 01:46.313
what are you going to do now?

01:46.313 --> 01:49.634
I'm going to Butterworld!

01:53.862 --> 01:56.740
Hey Daphne, bring that laundry over here, will you?

01:56.740 --> 01:57.606
What for?

01:57.606 --> 02:00.516
Well, I was just reading about an intelligence test you can give your dog.

02:00.516 --> 02:03.725
You throw a towel over its head and see how long it takes him to shake it off.

02:03.725 --> 02:04.623
Eddie!

02:04.623 --> 02:07.358
Oh, and the faster he takes the towel off, the smarter he is?

02:07.358 --> 02:11.534
No, the faster he folds it.

02:11.534 --> 02:12.798
All right,

02:12.798 --> 02:16.066
they ranked all the dogs and the smartest was a border collie;

02:16.066 --> 02:17.678
he did it in seven seconds.

02:17.678 --> 02:24.498
All right, come on boy, take it off.

02:24.498 --> 02:26.745
Six... seven.

02:26.745 --> 02:34.020
OK, the next fastest one was a poodle, I know he's as smart as a poodle.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.557
OK, so he's no poodle...

02:36.557 --> 02:38.677
he's not a beagle either...

02:38.677 --> 02:41.425
or a German shepherd... or a Labrador

02:41.425 --> 02:44.256
Oh, for God's sake, Eddie!

02:44.256 --> 02:48.036
Yes, well, if you ask me, he's refusing to do that trick because he knows if he does it right,

02:48.036 --> 02:51.497
you'll have him doing it every time we have company.

02:51.497 --> 02:54.318
Hey, I'll bet you're right!

02:54.318 --> 02:56.830
Nice going, Eddie!

02:59.368 --> 03:00.894
Oh, hello, Dr. Crane.

03:00.894 --> 03:05.076
I appreciate the false cheer, Daphne.  But I'm sure you've seen this?  Today's society page?

03:05.076 --> 03:10.818
Don't tell me, don't tell me, don't tell me!  I'm saving it for after dinner!

03:10.818 --> 03:12.704
Apparently Maris is going on a three-week cruise.

03:12.704 --> 03:16.044
Her friends threw her a bon voyage party.  Look at the photo.

03:16.044 --> 03:19.680
It's Maris on the arm of Pierson Broadwater.

03:19.680 --> 03:23.069
Oh, Dr. Crane, look!  She's just standing there, barely touching him,

03:23.069 --> 03:25.788
with only the tiniest bit of a smile on her face!

03:25.788 --> 03:30.166
I know, you can practically hear the zing zing zing of her heartstrings!

03:30.166 --> 03:32.018
Oh, Dr Crane... 
Sorry, Niles.

03:32.018 --> 03:38.315
Oh, it gets worse.  This morning I spoke to Marta, my ex-maid and current mole.

03:38.315 --> 03:41.739
She reports that Broadwater is just the latest in a parade of escorts.

03:41.739 --> 03:46.504
The gigolos are swarming around Maris like ants on a Snickers bar!

03:46.504 --> 03:48.192
Well, wait a minute, that's good news.

03:48.192 --> 03:51.320
If she's seeing a whole bunch of people, that means she's not serious about any one of them.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.788
You think? 
Yeah, sure!

03:52.788 --> 03:54.276
They're probably just her escorts.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.337
You know how she loves going to parties.

03:56.337 --> 04:01.939
Yes, and she never liked going anywhere alone.  Except to bed.

04:01.939 --> 04:04.997
More good news.

04:04.997 --> 04:08.113
And Niles, it wouldn't hurt you to go out a little bit every once in a while too.

04:08.113 --> 04:10.959
If you're suggesting that I start dating, you can save your breath.

04:10.959 --> 04:13.018
Women don't exactly find me irresistible.

04:13.018 --> 04:15.957
Oh, come on, Niles, you've had lots of girlfriends.

04:15.957 --> 04:20.680
Oh, let's count.  There's Maris...

04:20.680 --> 04:26.819
oh no, Dora, my childhood pen pal from Costa Rica...

04:26.819 --> 04:32.141
I seem to recall a little girl in the fourth grade who lured me to a stairwell to show me her underpants.

04:32.141 --> 04:36.754
You know, Niles, I think your problem is you still picture yourself as the same geeky kid you were in high school.

04:36.754 --> 04:38.570
But you've come a long way since then.

04:38.570 --> 04:41.440
And you're not doing yourself any favours sitting home every night.

04:41.440 --> 04:44.595
Now just think about it.

04:44.595 --> 04:45.702
Wine, Dr. Crane?

04:45.702 --> 04:50.222
Well, wouldn't you?

04:54.908 --> 04:56.462
HE WAS A BAND LEADER MARRIED TO CHARO

04:56.462 --> 05:00.173
Oh, give it up, the man had every right to be proud of his dog.

05:00.173 --> 05:02.592
Well, I just don't like show-offs, OK?

05:02.592 --> 05:08.571
"Ginger, catch the frisbee.  Ginger, roll over.  Ginger, do my taxes!"

05:08.571 --> 05:10.670
Just because Eddie's not good at tricks...

05:10.670 --> 05:16.534
The hell he isn't!  He just likes the kind that gives him a chance to use his brain!  Eddie's a thinker!

05:16.534 --> 05:21.101
Just watch this.  Open the door for him.

05:21.101 --> 05:24.128
Now, I've been teaching him the names of all his chew toys.

05:24.128 --> 05:27.517
Eddie, get your banana.

05:28.919 --> 05:32.039
Now he's thinking,

05:34.375 --> 05:38.346
"which one's the banana?"

05:38.346 --> 05:44.976
Now he's thinking, "what the heck did I do with my banana?"

05:44.976 --> 05:48.713
Now he's thinking, "which one's the emergency button?"

05:48.713 --> 05:50.468
Come on!

05:53.418 --> 05:54.530
Oh, Dr Crane!

05:54.530 --> 05:57.004
Hello.  I let myself in, I hope that's all right.

05:57.004 --> 05:58.065
Fine.  What's up?

05:58.065 --> 06:00.759
Oh, I just stopped by to ask you a question.  Are you free Saturday night?

06:00.759 --> 06:01.570
Sure!

06:01.570 --> 06:04.112
Well, I'm not!  I have a date!

06:04.112 --> 06:06.432
Oh! 
Oh!

06:06.432 --> 06:07.881
Bravo, Dr. Crane!

06:07.881 --> 06:09.619
Good for you!  Who is she?

06:09.619 --> 06:16.318
Marjorie Nash, the "Fruit On The Bottom" yogurt heiress.

06:16.318 --> 06:20.236
I bumped into her at the Frye museum.  Before I knew it, your advice was thundering in my ears.

06:20.236 --> 06:21.782
I found myself asking her out.

06:21.782 --> 06:25.709
We'll be attending our club's annual winter dance, the "Snow Ball!"

06:25.709 --> 06:27.331
Good for you!

06:27.331 --> 06:28.445
What's she like?

06:28.445 --> 06:36.552
Well, she's terribly haughty and rumours persist about her husband's death.  But still, a date's a date!

06:36.552 --> 06:39.372
Snow Ball?  Sounds very glamourous.

06:39.372 --> 06:40.503
I didn't know you could dance!

06:40.503 --> 06:42.435
Oh, I can't.

06:42.435 --> 06:45.553
Oh, dear.

06:45.553 --> 06:49.097
You don't think she'll want me to?

06:49.097 --> 06:53.027
I've taken Maris to dozens of these things, she's never once asked to dance...

06:53.027 --> 06:58.780
of course, Maris dislikes public displays of rhythm.

06:58.780 --> 07:02.134
Oh, this is terrible!  My first date's a miserable failure before it even begins.

07:02.134 --> 07:03.179
I'll just have to cancel.

07:03.179 --> 07:05.306
All you need are a few dancing lessons.

07:05.306 --> 07:07.342
I'd be happy to give you some.

07:07.342 --> 07:07.902
You would?

07:07.902 --> 07:13.022
Yeah!  Growing up, I used to practise all the time with my brother Billy - the ballroom dancer?

07:13.022 --> 07:18.123
I couldn't prevail upon you like that, it would be too much trouble. We'll have to move this!

07:19.516 --> 07:21.584
OK, now push the chair back

07:21.584 --> 07:24.630
Or not.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.387
Alright, we'll start with the box step.

07:28.387 --> 07:29.899
Box step...
It's very simple.

07:29.899 --> 07:34.469
Take my hand like so, and your other hand goes around my waist.

07:34.469 --> 07:37.155
Now, start with your left foot.

07:37.155 --> 07:39.359
OK, which one?

07:39.359 --> 07:44.679
Oh, hush!  Step towards me, then bring your right foot forward-and-over,

07:44.679 --> 07:46.597
and slide the left over to meet it.

07:46.597 --> 07:50.795
Then the right foot goes back, the left back-and-over,

07:50.795 --> 07:53.032
and the right slides next to it.

07:53.032 --> 07:55.850
And that's it!  All right, once again.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.191
A one-two-

07:58.191 --> 08:01.868
Oh! three, a two-two-three,

08:01.868 --> 08:07.092
a three-two-three, a four-two three...

08:07.092 --> 08:10.607
This is boring yet difficult.

08:10.607 --> 08:13.725
Aw, there's no trick to dancing.  It's just a matter of coordination.

08:13.725 --> 08:22.494
Hell, if you can ride a bike, or skip rope, or kick a ball, you can certainly...

08:25.198 --> 08:31.205
Alright, once again.  A one-two- Oh!-three...

08:35.096 --> 08:37.111
You're really doing very well, Dr. Crane.

08:37.111 --> 08:39.174
Earlier you seemed a bit tense.

08:39.174 --> 08:43.107
You've really relaxed now though, haven't you?

08:46.348 --> 08:48.344
Hey, you two are looking pretty sharp.

08:48.344 --> 08:50.741
Well, I think we're ready to move on to the samba.

08:50.741 --> 08:56.041
Eddie, fetch me a samba tape.  Xavier Cougat.

08:56.041 --> 09:03.104
Now he's thinking, "the later Hollywood stuff, or the early New York recordings?"

09:03.104 --> 09:06.714
Now guess what I'm thinking. 
I'll get it myself.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.340
Well, I'm going to hit the hay.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.227
Good-night -- bend-and-turn ?

09:10.227 --> 09:14.281
see-you-in-the-morning ?spin-and-dip

09:14.281 --> 09:17.248
there's-my-phone -- flip-and-push ?

09:17.248 --> 09:18.732
Niles-Crane.

09:18.732 --> 09:20.596
Oh, Marjorie.

09:20.596 --> 09:22.667
How are you?

09:22.667 --> 09:25.414
Oh, what a shame.  Well, er,

09:25.414 --> 09:28.401
no no it's alright, there'll be other dances.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.099
No, no, I understand completely.

09:31.099 --> 09:33.092
Take care.

09:35.949 --> 09:37.962
Guess I won't be needing those dancing lessons.

09:37.962 --> 09:43.490
I guess not.  I'm sorry, son.

09:44.399 --> 09:47.647
I couldn't find any Cougie, but this'll do!

09:47.647 --> 09:49.856
Alright now,

09:49.856 --> 09:52.948
in the samba you have to hold me a little closer.

09:52.948 --> 09:53.493
You ready?

09:53.493 --> 09:54.983
Daphne, there's one thing I wanted to mention...

09:54.983 --> 09:57.102
Yeah?

10:00.228 --> 10:03.111
I'm a dancer, a dancer dances!

10:06.925 --> 10:09.373
WHERE ELSE WOULD CORONERS 
GET TOGETHER?

10:09.373 --> 10:12.170
Wow..Look who's Here..
it's my dancing partner.

10:12.170 --> 10:15.031
Hello, Fred! 
Hello, Ginger!

10:15.031 --> 10:18.395
It's a little joke we have!

10:18.395 --> 10:20.637
Look Daphne, I got two new CDs today.

10:20.637 --> 10:23.433
Tonight we master the mambo and the conga.

10:23.433 --> 10:26.564
I can feel myself growing a pencil-thin moustache just saying that.

10:26.564 --> 10:27.882
You're having more lessons tonight?

10:27.882 --> 10:30.925
Oh, yes!  He's going to be the best dancer at the ball.

10:30.925 --> 10:34.088
I'll just go get us some coffees.

10:36.108 --> 10:38.918
Why didn't you tell her your date had cancelled?  You don't need more lessons.

10:38.918 --> 10:42.919
I wanted to, but she's just having so much fun!

10:42.919 --> 10:45.695
Come on, Niles, you think I don't see the way you look at Daphne?

10:45.695 --> 10:46.373
What are you implying?

10:46.373 --> 10:48.063
You know damn well what I'm implying.

10:48.063 --> 10:49.385
Take my word for it,

10:49.385 --> 10:51.433
you're sticking a fork in the toaster here.

10:51.433 --> 10:56.478
Well, my muffin's stuck!

10:59.324 --> 11:01.981
Besides, what's the harm in a few dance lessons?

11:01.981 --> 11:05.957
It's nighttime.  You're alone.  The music's on.

11:05.957 --> 11:08.166
You've got your arms around her.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.671
You'll end up saying something you can't take back.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.130
I have no intention of saying anything.

11:12.130 --> 11:13.428
No one ever does.

11:13.428 --> 11:16.485
Take my word for it.

11:16.485 --> 11:19.338
When I was separated from your mother,

11:19.338 --> 11:24.103
there was this pretty coroner in the city morgue.

11:24.103 --> 11:26.720
I always had a bit of a crush on her.

11:26.720 --> 11:32.988
So whenever we'd find a dead body, I'd yell out, "OK boys, I'll take it from here!"

11:32.988 --> 11:35.668
So one night, I invited her down to the corner bar.

11:35.668 --> 11:37.519
Coroners have their own bars?

11:37.519 --> 11:45.253
No, corner, Niles, the corner bar!

11:45.253 --> 11:50.989
Anyway, we had a few drinks, the lights were low, Sinatra on the jukebox.

11:50.989 --> 11:54.700
Before I knew it, it just all came pouring out of me.  I told her how I felt.

11:54.700 --> 11:59.140
I mean, I knew the second it was out of my mouth that it was a mistake.

11:59.140 --> 12:03.645
She let me down easy but we still had to go on seeing each other all the time.

12:03.645 --> 12:08.567
It sure was no fun going to the morgue after that!

12:08.567 --> 12:12.380
So, what time are we starting your lessons tonight, Dr. Crane?

12:12.380 --> 12:14.837
Actually, that won't be necessary.

12:14.837 --> 12:17.381
I just got a call from Marjorie.  Something's come up.

12:17.381 --> 12:18.574
I won't be going to the ball.

12:18.574 --> 12:20.668
Oh.  Well, I'm sorry.

12:20.668 --> 12:24.201
It's quite all right, and thank you for all your help.

12:24.201 --> 12:29.201
It seems such a shame to waste all that hard work...

12:29.201 --> 12:34.513
I hope you don't think I'm being too forward, but what would you say about our going to the dance together?

12:34.513 --> 12:37.631
Now, now, he's already taken up too much of your time, Daphne,

12:37.631 --> 12:38.783
he couldn't ask you to do that.

12:38.783 --> 12:41.741
No, but it would be as much fun for me as it would be for him!

12:41.741 --> 12:43.652
I'd love an elegant evening out!

12:43.652 --> 12:45.571
What do you say, Dr. Crane?

12:45.571 --> 12:46.981
Tell her what you say, Dr. Crane.

12:46.981 --> 12:47.977
Pick you up at seven?

12:47.977 --> 12:51.337
Ooh, yes! Great!

12:59.446 --> 13:03.407
No, Eddie that's not your banana, that's Mr. Pig.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.289
Listen to the difference:

13:05.289 --> 13:11.680
pig, banana!  Pig, banana!  Pig, banana!

13:11.680 --> 13:15.617
Ah, I still love you, you little pinhead.  Go sit down.

13:16.971 --> 13:20.277
Oh Frasier, am I glad you're back!  Listen, all sorts of....

13:20.277 --> 13:22.679
Dad, please, please!  I have just spent the most wonderful six days with Frederick.

13:22.679 --> 13:25.344
I am technically still on vacation till ten a.m. tomorrow.

13:25.344 --> 13:26.415
Yeah, but listen...

13:26.415 --> 13:28.200
Bup-bup-bup-bup-bup!

13:28.200 --> 13:31.659
Dad, I do not care to know how hard Daphne made you exercise,

13:31.659 --> 13:34.944
or about the boring foreign film Niles made you sit through,

13:34.944 --> 13:40.793
or about the progress of Eddie's on-again, off-again romance with the ottoman!

13:40.793 --> 13:42.433
But you don't understand... 
Dad, please!

13:42.433 --> 13:46.480
For all intents and purposes, I am not here.

13:46.480 --> 13:49.601
That'll be my date! Ooh, I'm so excited,

13:49.601 --> 13:53.082
this is me first ball!  Oh, I hope he likes my dress...

13:53.082 --> 13:53.490
Daphne?

13:53.490 --> 13:56.973
Hello, Dr. Crane, welcome back!

13:57.590 --> 13:59.078
Hello!

13:59.078 --> 14:04.094
Wow!
Ohhh, you!

14:04.094 --> 14:05.160
Niles?

14:05.160 --> 14:07.289
Oh, Frasier, you're back! Well, our carriage awaits.

14:07.289 --> 14:10.141
And you'd better get her home at a decent hour, I'm gonna be waiting up for you!

14:10.141 --> 14:12.854
Oh, Mr. Crane!

14:19.336 --> 14:21.880
What the hell was that?

14:21.880 --> 14:24.385
Eddie, did you hear sumpin'?

14:24.385 --> 14:26.868
Can't be Frasier, he's still on vacation!

14:26.868 --> 14:29.172
Dad, what was that?

14:29.172 --> 14:33.386
Dad, will you stop kidding around?  Was that a date?  Dad!

14:48.046 --> 14:52.991
Oh, Dr. Crane, it's so beautiful!

14:52.991 --> 14:56.473
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?

14:56.473 --> 14:59.680
You know, when I was at school I knew a boy named Niles.

14:59.680 --> 15:02.362
I called him Niley.

15:02.362 --> 15:06.680
Just for tonight, could you call me Niles?

15:06.680 --> 15:09.556
You're a vision... everyone's staring at you!

15:09.556 --> 15:12.391
Well, you look awfully handsome yourself...

15:12.391 --> 15:14.966
Niles.

15:18.986 --> 15:20.508
Would you like some champagne?

15:20.508 --> 15:22.692
Oh, that would be lovely. 
Be back in a moment.

15:23.382 --> 15:24.767
Two champagnes, tout de suite.

15:24.767 --> 15:27.980
Niles, dear! How are you!

15:27.980 --> 15:28.904
Just fine, thanks.

15:28.904 --> 15:30.511
Andrew, say hello to Niles.

15:30.511 --> 15:34.172
Haven't seen you for ages.  Feel just terrible about you and Maris.

15:34.172 --> 15:38.499
Oh yes, we were just devastated.  Positively everyone's talking about it.

15:38.499 --> 15:39.943
Oh, and how is positively everyone?

15:39.943 --> 15:46.321
Devastated.  We were just saying that to Maris, when we ran into her and Bradley Paxton at the Breever's Cup.

15:46.321 --> 15:49.500
No, she was with Calvin Oldi at the Breever's Cup.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.641
Well, it's so hard to keep track

15:51.641 --> 15:55.157
anyway. Niles, if there's anything we can do to cheer you up?

15:55.157 --> 15:57.053
Just let us know...

15:57.053 --> 16:00.408
Perhaps a murder-suicide pact.

16:00.408 --> 16:02.687
Well, they weren't very nice!

16:02.687 --> 16:07.325
Well, everyone in our set seems to have this idea that while Maris is out living the high life,

16:07.325 --> 16:09.430
I'm sitting at home, crushed and lonely.

16:09.430 --> 16:12.363
Yeah, well, never mind those gossipy twits.

16:12.363 --> 16:14.566
Tonight, you're all mine.

16:14.566 --> 16:21.043
Now take me in your arms, Niles, and let the music carry us away...

16:24.827 --> 16:28.697
Thank you, we'll be back in ten minutes.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.708
I can't remember when I've had a better time.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.634
I'm on Cloud Nine!

16:51.634 --> 16:55.582
I'd have to look down to see Cloud Nine!

16:55.582 --> 16:59.244
Daphne, I must tell you again, that is an exquisite gown.

16:59.244 --> 17:02.463
Oh, thanks! It was way out of my price range, but

17:02.463 --> 17:09.540
did you ever see something and say, "I just have to have it?"

17:10.362 --> 17:12.960
Where's my chair?

17:16.400 --> 17:18.453
A tango!

17:18.453 --> 17:19.680
Oh, you never taught me a tango!

17:19.680 --> 17:22.648
Oh, you'll love it!  It's perfect for you!

17:22.648 --> 17:27.926
This is a passionate, full-blooded dance that rose up from the slums of Buenos Aires.

17:27.926 --> 17:33.913
Well, the parallels between me and an unemployed gaucho aside, I think we probably should just sit this one out.

17:33.913 --> 17:38.386
Oh, nonsense!  There's only one rule in the tango:

17:38.386 --> 17:44.430
our bodies must be in continuous contact, with not a sliver of daylight between us.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.719
I can do that.

17:48.946 --> 17:50.966
Stop!  Don't be afraid!

17:50.966 --> 17:53.221
Daphne won't let anything happen to you.

17:53.221 --> 17:55.122
I don't think-
Don't think!

17:55.122 --> 17:56.934
Just feel.

17:56.934 --> 18:00.102
You're an Argentine slum-dweller.

18:00.102 --> 18:04.635
You have no house, no car, you don't know where your next meal is coming from.

18:04.635 --> 18:06.764
But none of that matters.

18:06.764 --> 18:10.097
Because tonight...

18:10.097 --> 18:11.409
we have the tango!

18:11.409 --> 18:15.301
Oh mama, I've got it all!

18:22.452 --> 18:25.270
That's it!  You're dazzling!  You're brilliant!

18:25.270 --> 18:27.300
But I feel you're holding back!

18:27.300 --> 18:28.159
I am.

18:28.159 --> 18:31.128
Oh, this is no time for inhibitions!

18:31.128 --> 18:33.274
I know.

18:34.832 --> 18:38.293
Oh. let it out Niles. Let everything out!

18:38.293 --> 18:42.766
Oh Daphne, I adore you!

18:45.725 --> 18:49.504
I adore you too!

18:49.504 --> 18:52.520
What?!?!?

18:52.520 --> 18:54.769
I adore you too.

18:54.769 --> 18:57.472
Oh, how I've longed to hear those words!

18:57.472 --> 18:59.648
Oh, how I've longed to say them!

18:59.648 --> 19:01.985
You're beautiful!  You're a goddess!

19:01.985 --> 19:05.092
I don't ever want this moment to end!

19:05.092 --> 19:07.428
Then let's not let it!

19:36.697 --> 19:39.421
This is the most glorious night of my life.

19:39.421 --> 19:42.774
Oh, mine too...

19:55.095 --> 19:58.609
Oh, Daphne!  I'm a new man!

19:58.609 --> 20:00.642
Do you have any idea what I'm feeling?

20:00.642 --> 20:05.997
Of course I do!  Your friends look positively dumbstruck.

20:05.997 --> 20:09.741
From now on there'll be no more of that "oh poor Niles" attitude...

20:09.741 --> 20:11.398
Far from it!

20:11.398 --> 20:14.981
I knew you were a good dancer,

20:14.981 --> 20:19.597
but I had no idea you were such a good actor!

20:19.597 --> 20:21.505
Actor?

20:21.505 --> 20:25.228
Yeah!  "Daphne, you're a goddess, Daphne, I adore you..."

20:25.228 --> 20:27.811
We fooled everyone, didn't we?

20:30.361 --> 20:35.321
Oh...oh.  We certainly did, didn't we?

20:35.321 --> 20:38.196
I'm surprised it was so easy!

20:38.196 --> 20:43.488
Well, given the right circumstances, anyone can be fooled.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.610
Ooh!  What do you say to another dance?

20:45.610 --> 20:49.143
No thanks, it's getting late and I've danced enough.

20:49.143 --> 20:54.352
Alright, then!  I'll just go powder my nose and then we'll be off.

21:03.364 --> 21:04.688
Niles?

21:04.688 --> 21:06.285
No, no, please.

21:06.285 --> 21:09.726
Claire Barnes?  I was an associate in your attorney's office.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.623
Oh, yes, Claire.  Uh, it's good to see you again.

21:12.623 --> 21:14.390
Well, I heard about you and Maris.

21:14.390 --> 21:19.288
And I just wanted to give you my card and tell you you're free to call me anytime.

21:19.288 --> 21:21.849
Oh, thank you, but I'm happy with my attorney.

21:21.849 --> 21:25.916
I meant to go dancing.

21:25.916 --> 21:28.865
OH...Thanks..

21:31.668 --> 21:33.390
Well, are you ready?

21:33.390 --> 21:36.034
Ah..

21:36.034 --> 21:37.420
No, I don't think I am.

21:37.420 --> 21:38.559
I beg your pardon?

21:38.559 --> 21:41.780
Er, I mean yes.  Uh, let's go.

21:41.780 --> 21:44.334
Well, we certainly had fun tonight, didn't we?

21:44.334 --> 21:45.736
We certainly did.

21:45.736 --> 21:48.950
And to think you almost didn't come to the ball!

21:48.950 --> 21:54.553
You know, it's such a shame when people let fear stop them from trying new things.

21:55.133 --> 21:58.035
Excuse me.

22:02.658 --> 22:05.441
I'm ready now.
