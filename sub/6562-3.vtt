- NEW PLAN.

09:17.233 --> 09:19.667
DO NOT BREAK UP WITH HM.

09:19.700 --> 09:21.300
AND DO NOT BREAK THIS.

09:21.333 --> 09:23.333
- WELL, IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BREAK UP WITH HIM,

09:23.367 --> 09:25.467
THEN WHAT DO I DO?

09:25.500 --> 09:28.067
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.

[cell phone ringing]

09:36.733 --> 09:40.867
- SORRY?

09:44.500 --> 09:45.467
- HEY.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.633
- SO ARE YOU MAD

09:46.667 --> 09:49.300
ABOUT WHAT JAMES TOLD YOU?

09:49.333 --> 09:50.567
- WE'RE COOL.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.033
I MEAN, I WAS A LITTLE UPSET
AT FIRST,

09:52.067 --> 09:53.833
BUT HE WAS HONEST WITH ME.

09:53.867 --> 09:56.200
- YOU WERE ONLY A LITTLE UPSET?

09:56.233 --> 09:57.333
- HEY, IF HE WANTS TO PUT
HIS MOUTH

09:57.367 --> 09:59.200
ON SOMETHING WORN-OUT AND GROSS,

09:59.233 --> 10:00.500
THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

10:00.533 --> 10:02.233
- EXCUSE ME?

10:02.267 --> 10:04.400
- [blows raspberries]
I WAS ABOUT TO DUMP IT ANYWAY.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.200
- OH, WELL, IF YOU WERE GOING
TO DUMP ME ANYWAY,

10:06.233 --> 10:08.200
MAYBE I'M GLAD
JAMES AND I KISSED.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.900
- YOU AND JAMES KISSED?

10:09.933 --> 10:11.233
- LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE,

10:11.267 --> 10:13.033
NOW YOU DON'T NEED
A NEW TOOTHBRUSH.

10:13.067 --> 10:15.667
HA.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.700
- OOH, THIS IS GETTING GOOD.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.033
- [exhales deeply]

10:27.067 --> 10:28.533
LOOK...

10:28.567 --> 10:29.867
- LOGAN, HEY, COME BACK, MAN!

10:29.900 --> 10:31.200
LET'S TALK!

10:31.233 --> 10:32.733
- BOO!
WHAT A RIP-OFF.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.367
- NO, THIS IS BETTER.

10:34.400 --> 10:35.967
SEE, THE REJECTED MALE
STORMS OFF,

10:36.000 --> 10:37.167
WHILE THE BACKSTABBING FRIEND

10:37.200 --> 10:39.033
FEARS FOR THE FUTURE
OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP.

10:39.067 --> 10:41.333
- HMM.
WHAT ABOUT LOGAN AND CAMILLE?

10:41.367 --> 10:43.167
- OH, THEY ARE TOAST.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.167
- HELLO?
I'M STANDING RIGHT HERE.

10:46.200 --> 10:48.500
- [silently]

10:50.233 --> 10:52.000
- IT'S SIMPLE.

10:52.033 --> 10:54.400
JUST DON'T BREAK UP WITH HIM.

10:54.433 --> 10:55.733
- BUT I CAN'T JUST KEEP
PRETENDING

10:55.767 --> 10:57.033
TO BE HIS DREAM GIRLFRIEND

10:57.067 --> 10:58.333
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

10:58.367 --> 11:00.133
- WHY NOT?

11:00.167 --> 11:02.333
- ANOTHER FRUIT WATER
FOR MY FRUIT CUP.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.133
- OH, COULD YOU GET ME ANOTHER,
SWEETIE?

11:04.167 --> 11:06.833
I'M SO THIRSTY.

11:06.867 --> 11:10.467
- OKAY. OKAY.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.000
- WAIT A MINUTE.

11:12.033 --> 11:14.333
WHAT IF WE CAN GET CARLOS
TO BREAK UP WITH HER?

11:14.367 --> 11:16.167
- YES.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.000
- YEAH, BUT CARLOS
IS REALLY IN LOVE WITH ME.

11:19.033 --> 11:21.800
SO FAR HE'S GIVEN ME
A SEVEN-PAGE LOVE POEM,

11:21.833 --> 11:23.700
A BOUQUET OF CORN DOGS,

11:23.733 --> 11:25.700
AND A COUPON BOOK

11:25.733 --> 11:26.967
FOR CARLOS HUGS.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.300
- AWW.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.033
- JUST BE THE WORST GIRLFRIEND
EVER.

11:30.067 --> 11:33.000
BE BOSSY,
SPEND ALL OF HIS MONEY ON SHOES,

11:33.033 --> 11:35.700
CRY ABOUT EVERYTHING,

11:35.733 --> 11:39.033
AND HATE ALL OF
HIS BEST GUY FRIENDS.

11:39.067 --> 11:41.233
- OKAY, AND IF ALL THAT
DOESN'T WORK?

11:41.267 --> 11:43.300
- BE DISGUSTING.

11:43.333 --> 11:45.033
- HERE YOU GO, HONEY.

11:45.067 --> 11:47.733
- UGH, I'M SICK OF ALL THIS
FRUIT WATER!

11:47.767 --> 11:49.633
JUST BUY ME SHOES.
NOW!

11:49.667 --> 11:51.000
- OKAY.
ANYTHING YOU--

11:51.033 --> 11:53.367

11:53.400 --> 11:56.167
- OKAY!
AH!

11:56.200 --> 11:59.867
- YEAH, I GIVE HIM
ABOUT TWO HOURS TOPS.

11:59.900 --> 12:02.233
- OKAY, WE WRAPPED FOR THE DAY.

12:02.267 --> 12:03.333
I'M TOTALLY FREE.

12:03.367 --> 12:05.200
NOW HOW ABOUT THAT DATE?

12:05.233 --> 12:06.667
- YOU BLEW ME OFF AT THE POOL,

12:06.700 --> 12:08.033
THEN AT THE PARK,

12:08.067 --> 12:10.133
THEN AGAIN AT THE POOL.

12:10.167 --> 12:11.400
- AND I'M SORRY.

12:11.433 --> 12:13.467
I MEAN, I LOVE THAT MY CAREER
IS TAKING OFF.

12:13.500 --> 12:16.300
I JUST HATE
HOW IT'S MAKING THINGS SO--

12:16.333 --> 12:17.333
[phone rings]

12:17.367 --> 12:18.733
- UNBELIEVABLE.

12:18.767 --> 12:21.900
- UH, THAT WAS YOUR PHONE.

12:21.933 --> 12:24.867
- I HAVE TO GO TO THE STUDIO.

12:24.900 --> 12:27.167
OH, MY ONE TO YOUR THREE.

12:27.200 --> 12:28.733
[grumbles]

12:28.767 --> 12:32.567
[sweeping orchestral music]

12:32.600 --> 12:33.800
- WHAT DID I MISS?

12:33.833 --> 12:36.000
- NOW KENDALL BLEW HER OFF.

12:36.033 --> 12:38.233
- OOH.
NICE TWIST.

12:38.267 --> 12:39.333
PASS ME A SODA.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.167
- POPCORN ME.

12:43.233 --> 12:45.200
- LOG, WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THIS.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.333
- OOH, HEY, THERE, PAL.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.200
YOU'RE JUST IN TIME
TO SEE ASTEROID JAMES

12:49.233 --> 12:50.200
CRASH INTO VENUS,

12:50.233 --> 12:53.000
THE PLANET OF LOVE.

12:53.033 --> 12:54.333
crash!

12:54.367 --> 12:55.200
- WE GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE ACTING.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.067
I MEAN, THERE WAS A BOMB!

12:57.100 --> 12:59.833
THEN TELL ME WHAT I CAN DO TO
GET BACK TO BEING YOUR FRIEND.

12:59.867 --> 13:01.900
- I DON'T KNOW, OKAY?

13:01.933 --> 13:03.833
I'VE NEVER BEEN CHEATED ON
BEFORE.

13:03.867 --> 13:06.667
- WHAT IF WE EVEN THE SCORE,
HUH?

13:10.233 --> 13:12.033
GO AHEAD.

13:12.067 --> 13:16.000
BREAK MY LUCKY COMB.

13:16.033 --> 13:19.033
- HI, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
BIG FANS.

13:19.067 --> 13:20.467
- BUT WE WERE THINKING

13:20.500 --> 13:22.133
THAT THE STORYLINE
MIGHT BENEFIT FROM MORE ACTION.

13:22.167 --> 13:23.700
- LIKE, SAY, A DUEL.

13:23.733 --> 13:25.833
- I LIKE THAT.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.467
BROADSWORDS AT DAWN.

13:27.500 --> 13:30.367
- ISN'T DAWN REALLY EARLY?

13:30.400 --> 13:33.133
- BROADSWORDS AT 11:00.

13:33.167 --> 13:35.133
- SORRY.
NO BLOOD.

13:35.167 --> 13:37.000
PALMWOODS RULE.

13:37.033 --> 13:40.233
both:
THEN WHAT DO WE DUEL WITH?

13:43.600 --> 13:46.967
- TELL THEM WHY WE CAME BACK
TO ROCQUE RECORDS, CARLOS.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.967
- I JUST WANTED A PLACE
TO PUT DOWN YOUR SHOES

13:50.000 --> 13:51.567
SO I CAN BUY YOU SOME MORE.

13:51.600 --> 13:54.133
TURNS OUT I LOVE SHOE SHOPPING.

13:54.167 --> 13:57.233
OH, SWEET!

13:57.267 --> 13:59.633

13:59.667 --> 14:01.300
- WHAT'S WRONG, PUMPKIN?

14:01.333 --> 14:02.567
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:02.600 --> 14:07.800
I JUST CRY ALL THE TIME
AND FOR NO REASON AT ALL.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.400
- AND THAT'S HOW I KNOW
YOU CARE.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.700
- REALLY?

14:11.733 --> 14:13.533
- OKAY.
I'M HERE.

14:13.567 --> 14:15.333
- AND YOUR SESSION
IS CANCELLED,

14:15.367 --> 14:18.167
CARLOS'S FRIEND.

14:18.200 --> 14:22.300
- UGH!
I HATE ALL OF YOUR FRIENDS.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.067
ONLY SPEND TIME WITH ME.

14:24.100 --> 14:25.800
- AND I WILL,

14:25.833 --> 14:28.333
UNTIL YOU SEE WHAT NICE PEOPLE
THEY ARE.

14:31.367 --> 14:33.233
- [farts]

14:33.267 --> 14:35.567
- [laughs]
THAT WAS ME.

14:35.600 --> 14:38.467
NO MORE BEANS
WITH THAT CORN DOG, PLEASE.

14:38.500 --> 14:42.167
LET'S GET SOME SHOES, HUH?

14:42.200 --> 14:44.633
- THAT BOY IS SO SWEET.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.733
AND THAT GIRL IS GOING TO WIN
BEST ACTRESS SOMEDAY.

14:46.767 --> 14:49.067
- AH!

14:49.100 --> 14:50.333
- OH, YOU'RE BACK.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.233
- YEAH, GUSTAVO DIDN'T NEED ME,

14:52.267 --> 14:54.200
CARLOS'S NEW GIRLFRIEND
SCARES ME,

14:54.233 --> 14:55.633
AND NOW WE CAN--

14:55.667 --> 14:57.033
WHAT'S WITH THE GLAMOUR?

14:57.067 --> 14:58.367
- YOU SAID YOU HAD TO GO
TO ROCQUE RECORDS,

14:58.400 --> 15:01.167
SO I TOLD MY AGENT SHE COULD
BOOK ANOTHER INTERVIEW.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.200
- WE CAN'T KEEP DOING THIS.

15:06.233 --> 15:07.333
- BUT I HAVE TO FOCUS
ON MY SHOW,

15:07.367 --> 15:09.733
AND YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON YOUR MUSIC.

15:09.767 --> 15:11.367
- AND IT'S ONLY GOING
TO GET WORSE.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.167
[horn squeaking]

15:20.000 --> 15:21.833
- WHOA. WHOA.
WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

15:21.867 --> 15:23.333
- THE TROUBLED COUPLE REALIZE

15:23.367 --> 15:26.000
THAT HAVING NO TIME
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

15:26.033 --> 15:28.133
MEANS THAT THERE IS
NO RELATIONSHIP

15:28.167 --> 15:31.200
AND, I GUESS, END IT.

15:31.233 --> 15:34.033
- DID YOU REALLY THINK THIS WAS
GOING TO BE EASY, BIG BROTHER?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.867
JO'S GOING TO BE A TV STAR.

15:35.900 --> 15:37.633
YOU'RE GOING TO BE A POP STAR.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.300
YOU'RE BOTH REALLY BUSY.

15:39.333 --> 15:40.400
BUT WHAT'S WORSE,

15:40.433 --> 15:42.333
SEEING JO FOR ONE MINUTE
AT A TIME

15:42.367 --> 15:43.833
OR NEVER SEEING HER AT ALL?

15:43.867 --> 15:47.167
- THAT 59 SECONDS IS LONGER
THAN ANY OF MY DATES.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.533
- YOU KNOW WHAT, BABY SISTER,

15:48.567 --> 15:50.900
YOU ARE RIGHT AGAIN.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.333
- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO BRING TO THE DUEL?

15:56.367 --> 15:57.333
- SURPRISE ME.

15:57.367 --> 16:00.400
- ALL RIGHT.

16:00.433 --> 16:04.000
[bird squawks]

16:04.033 --> 16:06.267
[whip cracks]

16:08.433 --> 16:12.200
[woman screaming]

16:12.233 --> 16:13.967
- DIDN'T HAVE TO END THIS WAY.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.333
- DIDN'T IT?

16:16.367 --> 16:19.133
DRAW.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.667

16:28.700 --> 16:30.833
- OH!

16:30.867 --> 16:32.200
- OOH!

16:32.233 --> 16:35.167
- WHOA.
THE 3-D ON THIS IS AMAZING.

16:35.200 --> 16:38.300
- IT'S LIKE THE SPIT BALLS
ARE COMING RIGHT AT YOU.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.000
OW!

16:42.200 --> 16:46.333
*

16:46.367 --> 16:48.833
[music droning]

16:52.500 --> 16:54.467
- I CAN'T HURT YOU.

16:54.500 --> 16:56.133
YOU'RE MY FRIEND.

16:56.167 --> 16:57.167
- SAME HERE.

16:57.200 --> 16:59.000
PLUS, I DON'T--

16:59.033 --> 17:01.233
I DON'T HAVE ANY SPIT LEFT.

17:01.267 --> 17:03.133
[coughs]

17:03.167 --> 17:04.367
- WE COOL?

17:04.400 --> 17:07.967
- YEAH, WE'RE COOL.

17:08.000 --> 17:10.333
- SO IN THE END,
FRIENDSHIP PREVAILS,

17:10.367 --> 17:13.000
BUT LOGAN STILL HAS TO CONFRONT
HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH CAMILLE.

17:13.033 --> 17:14.500
- HMM.
COULD YOU DO IT AFTER 3:00?

17:14.533 --> 17:16.367
I'VE GOT SOME PAPERWORK TO DO.

17:21.700 --> 17:26.500
- CARLOS, GUSTAVO HAS SOMETHING
THAT HE NEEDS TO TELL YOU.

17:26.533 --> 17:28.400
- YOU DIDN'T MEET SASHA
BY ACCIDENT.

17:28.433 --> 17:31.467
I HIRED HER TO MAKE YOU
FALL IN LOVE WITH HER

17:31.500 --> 17:33.233
AND THEN BREAK UP WITH YOU

17:33.267 --> 17:36.233
SO YOU COULD SING
THE BREAKUP SONG BETTER.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.333
AND I'M SORRY.

17:38.367 --> 17:39.333
- IS THAT TRUE?

17:39.367 --> 17:41.233
- NO. NO.
NO. NO.

17:41.267 --> 17:43.867
I MEAN YES, BUT NO.

17:43.900 --> 17:47.700
I MEAN, LOOK,
WHEN I WAS ACTING SO AWFUL,

17:47.733 --> 17:50.300
YOU WERE SO SWEET.

17:50.333 --> 17:53.167
AND, LOOK, I KNOW THIS MIGHT
SOUND STRANGE,

17:53.200 --> 17:55.400
BUT DO YOU THINK WE COULD
TRY AGAIN,

17:55.433 --> 17:58.267
FOR REAL THIS TIME?

18:00.233 --> 18:02.200
- WELL, THEN.

18:02.233 --> 18:04.233
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE LUNCH
WITH ME?

18:04.267 --> 18:07.400
- I WOULD.

18:07.433 --> 18:08.633
- COME ON, KELLY.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.800
LET'S GET BACK TO WORK.

18:10.833 --> 18:12.167
- ON WHAT?

18:12.200 --> 18:15.900
- A NEW SONG.
[grumbles]

18:17.500 --> 18:19.167
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:19.200 --> 18:22.033
YOU FORGIVE ME BUT YOU'RE
BREAKING UP WITH ME?

18:22.067 --> 18:26.133
- CAMILLE, 96% OF ALL FIRST
ROMANCES END IN BREAKUPS.

18:26.167 --> 18:28.833
YOU KISSING JAMES GIVES US
THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY

18:28.867 --> 18:31.300
FOR US TO GET OURS
OUT OF THE WAY NOW.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.733
- AND YOU'RE NOT SAD ABOUT THAT?

18:32.767 --> 18:34.200
- YES.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.733
BUT I'M GOING TO MASK MY PAIN

18:35.767 --> 18:37.867
BY BUZZ-CUTTING MY HAIR,
JOINING A GYM,

18:37.900 --> 18:41.033
AND NICKNAMING MYSELF
"THE ISLAND."

18:41.067 --> 18:45.667
- CAN WE BE FRIENDS?

18:45.700 --> 18:49.200
- FRIENDS IT IS.

18:49.233 --> 18:51.533
- UM, MAYBE WOULD COULD HUG TOO?

18:51.567 --> 18:54.033
I MEAN, FRIENDS HUG, RIGHT?

18:54.067 --> 18:56.233
- IT IS THE FRIENDLY THING
TO DO.

19:09.167 --> 19:10.500
AH, YEP.
