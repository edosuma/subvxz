WEBVTT

00:10.378 --> 00:12.480
<i>Previously on</i> The Serpent Queen...

00:12.513 --> 00:13.748
I dreamt that Diane died.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.450
<i>And then what?</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:17.618
<i>Then Henri died.</i>

00:17.651 --> 00:19.220
Then you already
know the price.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.755
That is a price
I am not willing to pay.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.457
We're here on behalf
of our niece, Mary Stuart.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.493
The king has forgotten
her betrothal

00:25.526 --> 00:27.194
<i>to his son, the dauphin.</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:28.729
Francis will wed
when the time is right.

00:28.763 --> 00:30.398
When will that be?

00:30.431 --> 00:33.033
When I am good and ready!

00:33.067 --> 00:34.769
He does not believe
the marriage is a good match.

00:35.803 --> 00:37.104
What in God's name

00:37.138 --> 00:39.039
does Henri know
about a good marriage?

00:39.073 --> 00:41.542
You've kept me a boy
to suit your needs.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.711
If my love has done you harm,

00:43.744 --> 00:45.446
you must send me away.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.748
Madame de Poitiers
has business to discuss.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.584
The wedding of the dauphin
will go forth as planned.

00:50.618 --> 00:51.819
<i>And may I suggest we invite</i>

00:52.052 --> 00:53.621
the Holy Roman emperor
of Spain.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.556
Welcome the man against whom

00:55.589 --> 00:57.658
<i>both you and your father
fought multiple wars?</i>

00:57.691 --> 00:59.660
- Are you mad?
- France!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.328
Will you joust
in the ceremonies today?

01:01.362 --> 01:03.831
It would please me to see you
as you were when we first met.

01:05.266 --> 01:07.101
Tell him I saw it in a dream,
that he dies

01:07.134 --> 01:08.669
<i>on this course
unless he stops now.</i>

01:08.702 --> 01:09.770
Once more.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.444
You are evil,
just like they all say.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.446
Oh, come on. No one's watching.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.747
<i>Are you sure
you picked the right girl?</i>

01:19.780 --> 01:22.583
Because if you don't take care
of this soon,

01:22.616 --> 01:24.552
<i>Mary will certainly
find her own way</i>

01:24.585 --> 01:26.520
to remain Queen of France.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.190
You've got a visitor.

02:04.758 --> 02:06.727
Your Majesty.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.800
You were expecting
your mistress?

02:12.833 --> 02:14.468
She won't come for you,
but perhaps

02:14.502 --> 02:17.438
you've already
figured that out by now.

02:18.806 --> 02:20.441
Sit.

02:22.476 --> 02:26.780
I take it I am the last person
you expected to see?

02:26.814 --> 02:29.283
I was arrested
for entering your chambers

02:29.316 --> 02:30.384
without permission.

02:30.417 --> 02:31.852
I did not think
you would care much

02:31.886 --> 02:33.787
about my situation.

02:33.821 --> 02:36.557
No, but I do.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.792
Forgiveness is the basis
of God's word,

02:38.826 --> 02:40.694
especially for those
who've been led astray

02:40.728 --> 02:43.197
through no fault of their own.

02:43.230 --> 02:46.267
I suspect it was Catherine
who sent you to my chambers.

02:46.300 --> 02:49.904
As I suspect her dalliance
with the dark arts.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.805
What I lack is proof of either.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.943
Perhaps you could help me find
what I'm looking for.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.514
<i>I'm sure you've heard many
unflattering things about me.</i>

03:00.548 --> 03:02.416
<i>And now you wonder
if you can trust me.</i>

03:02.449 --> 03:05.319
I--I see your dilemma.

03:06.887 --> 03:10.524
But allow me to tell you
of my true nature...

03:10.558 --> 03:12.927
so that you might better decide

03:12.960 --> 03:14.562
which side
you would like to be on.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.466
I think if you had seen me
on my wedding day,

03:19.500 --> 03:21.502
you would begin to understand.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.206
It was a day I thought

03:26.240 --> 03:28.576
just as God had willed it.

03:30.444 --> 03:34.214
Until I realized
that there were other...

03:34.248 --> 03:36.650
darker forces at work.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.754
Henri!

03:45.626 --> 03:46.927
Henri.

03:46.961 --> 03:49.463
<i>King Henri's tragic
fall came as a surprise</i>

03:49.496 --> 03:51.332
<i>to all except one.</i>

04:05.846 --> 04:06.947
Don't try to speak.

04:08.616 --> 04:09.783
Protect my children.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.620
Protect my children
like you've protected me.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.588
You will be here
to protect them yourself.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.824
All right? You will be here.

04:18.392 --> 04:21.295
You haven't lost the ability
to lie, I see.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.572
Come on!

04:32.473 --> 04:33.440
Fetch it, now.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.421
Let me pass.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.923
Your presence is no longer
required, madam.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.058
He needs me.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.027
This is a family matter.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.929
Henri!

05:05.973 --> 05:07.808
No. Please no.

05:10.844 --> 05:13.681
Why did you not stop jousting
when I told you to?

05:13.714 --> 05:15.049
Why?

05:17.851 --> 05:18.886
Why?

05:20.054 --> 05:22.056
I wanted your dream
to come true.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.458
- <i>No.</i>
- Because I know wanted it to.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.559
No!

05:25.592 --> 05:27.327
I told you to stop!

05:29.596 --> 05:31.465
You should never have loved me.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.033
What?

05:34.935 --> 05:36.637
I love you still.

05:37.871 --> 05:38.872
Shh...

05:38.906 --> 05:42.409
Then I pity you... as a fool.

05:44.378 --> 05:48.482
A very unfortunate accident.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.684
And on your wedding day.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.653
A day that should
be filled with joy,

05:52.686 --> 05:56.123
now marred by tragedy.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.624
The king is strong.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.826
He is certain to survive.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.394
He has a pole in his eye.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.932
At a time like this, we should
take comfort in our faith.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.434
Perhaps a prayer?

06:07.468 --> 06:09.737
Yes. Yes.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.472
Lead us, Uncle?

06:11.505 --> 06:13.373
Of course.

06:13.407 --> 06:15.676
Though might not
our Bourbon brothers

06:15.709 --> 06:19.446
take offense
to our Catholic liturgy, hm?

06:19.480 --> 06:23.117
Uh, today I believe
we are all Frenchmen first.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.451
<i>Oh.</i>

06:25.452 --> 06:28.756
I'm very pleased
to hear you say so.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.090
In these times of darkness,

06:30.124 --> 06:34.628
we must all reach out
towards the light.

06:34.661 --> 06:36.997
For example,
I would be more than happy

06:37.030 --> 06:39.166
to promote an alliance
with France

06:39.399 --> 06:42.536
to secure the English throne.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.105
<i>If, God forbid,</i>

06:45.139 --> 06:47.074
the king does not
survive the night,

06:47.107 --> 06:49.409
and the new Queen...

06:49.443 --> 06:52.713
<i>of France and Scotland</i>

06:52.746 --> 06:57.718
<i>happens also to be
the rightful Queen of England.</i>

06:57.751 --> 06:59.153
You see?

06:59.186 --> 07:00.788
Would certainly be convenient.

07:00.821 --> 07:03.857
Ah. Let us kneel.

07:06.827 --> 07:07.895
Really?

07:07.928 --> 07:09.129
I'm not kneeling.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.068
How is my father?

07:15.102 --> 07:18.972
I'm afraid we cannot remove
the shrapnel from his eye

07:19.006 --> 07:20.974
without risking his life.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.676
It's all right. It's all right.
It's all right.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.044
It's all right, Francis.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.747
Take each breath slowly, yeah?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.082
Remember?
Like sipping cold water.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.485
I'm not ready, Mary.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.220
Francis, if it is God's will
for you to be king,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.589
you only have to trust in Him
to make you ready.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.526
We are by your side.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.062
Let us be
your pillars of strength.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.597
And faith.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.966
Lean on us, Francis,
and all will be fine.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.569
You... you can lean on us,
too, remember.

07:48.602 --> 07:51.839
Like a... like a chair.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.473
- A what?
- <i>We're like the...</i>

07:53.507 --> 07:55.609
the legs of a chair.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.678
To sit on, you know.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.180
Sturdy.

08:00.214 --> 08:02.049
Come with me.

08:03.617 --> 08:05.786
<i>Well, you certainly</i>

08:05.819 --> 08:07.521
couldn't have wished
for a better time

08:07.554 --> 08:09.156
to work your mischief,
could you?

08:09.189 --> 08:11.692
I merely play the pieces
as I find them.

08:11.725 --> 08:15.529
This is not a chessboard, Charles.

08:15.562 --> 08:17.664
These people happen
to be my family.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.266
And you cannot expect me
to participate

08:19.499 --> 08:20.968
in their destruction.

08:21.001 --> 08:23.270
But that's what families do.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.972
Bit by bit,

08:25.005 --> 08:26.106
then all at once.

08:26.139 --> 08:29.543
No one gets out alive.

08:29.576 --> 08:30.677
What is wrong with you?

08:32.846 --> 08:34.114
When you operate on the king,

08:34.147 --> 08:35.816
you must be sure
of the outcome.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.017
Of course.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.652
What are the charges?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.657
Murdered his mother
while she slept,

08:43.690 --> 08:47.227
set fire to his neighbor's
house over a financial dispute,

08:47.261 --> 08:49.730
<i>and impropriety with a child.</i>

08:50.564 --> 08:51.565
Start with him.

08:52.733 --> 08:53.800
No. No, no, no.

08:53.834 --> 08:54.902
No! No!

08:54.935 --> 08:56.837
<i>Wait. Wait!</i>

08:59.673 --> 09:01.275
Please, please. No!

09:02.309 --> 09:04.811
No! Ah!

09:13.320 --> 09:14.321
Get him up.

09:18.892 --> 09:20.727
Now take it out.

09:22.095 --> 09:23.263
- Ah!
- Do it!

09:37.244 --> 09:38.779
Next.

09:38.812 --> 09:40.013
<i>No, no, no.
Please don't. No, no, no.</i>

10:27.627 --> 10:28.962
This is utter madness.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.130
Mm?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.410
Oh, Catherine.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.078
Excellent news.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.713
The king has recovered.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.882
Come. Come and sit with us.

10:48.915 --> 10:50.917
Come.

10:54.121 --> 10:56.857
<i>The king has recovered.</i>

10:59.259 --> 11:01.795
Um... um, Francis,

11:01.828 --> 11:05.198
your father wants to toast you
on your wedding day.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.400
Excellent idea.

11:06.433 --> 11:07.868
Oh.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.002
He must rest.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.370
<i>Nonsense. He's well.</i>

11:12.706 --> 11:13.673
More wine.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.208
- No.
- <i>He's--he's well.</i>

11:15.242 --> 11:18.445
<i>He's--he's fine.
Ah, you're fine.</i>

11:21.715 --> 11:23.717
Ah...

11:23.750 --> 11:25.852
mm... music!

11:25.886 --> 11:28.722
Um, we must celebrate
the miracle.

11:33.427 --> 11:35.162
Ah.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.696
Oh. Oh. Oh.

11:38.031 --> 11:40.033
Um... he's fine.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.701
Ah, maybe Catherine is right.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.236
Eh? You must rest a little.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.439
Eh? Let me hold you.

11:45.472 --> 11:49.042
Oh.

11:49.076 --> 11:50.844
Henri.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.716
There.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.353
Perfect.

12:07.861 --> 12:09.463
Let me hold you. There.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.997
<i>Let me hold you.</i>

12:11.031 --> 12:13.233
<i>There. There. There.</i>

12:13.266 --> 12:15.802
There.

12:15.836 --> 12:17.304
Have some rest.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.008
That is fine.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.078
There is no pulse.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.748
No. He's well.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.250
Tell them.

12:30.283 --> 12:32.185
<i>He's well.</i>

12:32.219 --> 12:33.787
I'm sorry.

12:33.820 --> 12:36.790
No. He's fine.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.091
He's fine.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.493
<i>No.</i>

12:39.526 --> 12:41.795
<i>He's well.</i>

12:41.828 --> 12:43.363
<i>He's well. Ah?</i>

12:43.396 --> 12:44.531
<i>Henri.</i>

12:45.899 --> 12:48.135
<i>Henri.</i>

12:48.168 --> 12:50.170
<i>No. No.</i>

12:51.238 --> 12:53.006
No, Henri.

12:55.408 --> 12:57.344
You're not dead, my love.

12:57.377 --> 13:00.013
Don't leave me.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.314
Don't leave me alone.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.784
Don't leave me.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.853
Henri.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.492
Catherine.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.196
Help me, cousin.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.564
Help me.

13:19.399 --> 13:20.934
Cousin.

13:23.003 --> 13:26.106
Madame de Poitiers...

13:26.139 --> 13:28.475
the king is dead.

13:28.508 --> 13:31.912
<i>No.</i>

13:33.280 --> 13:35.182
<i>He's not dead.</i>

13:35.215 --> 13:37.350
He's fine.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.818
Please forgive me.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.353
Stay.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.123
Stay with me.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.591
<i>Please.</i>

13:44.824 --> 13:46.493
<i>Henri.</i>

13:46.526 --> 13:49.429
Don't look so glum.

13:49.462 --> 13:51.364
Your ship just came in.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.934
<i>What we had believed
to be one of God's miracles</i>

13:53.967 --> 13:56.369
<i>turned out to be a tragedy.</i>

13:59.039 --> 14:01.174
<i>Your mistress wanted
to blame her magician</i>

14:01.208 --> 14:02.842
<i>for her husband's death.</i>

14:02.876 --> 14:05.312
<i>But it was her own doing.</i>

14:05.345 --> 14:07.447
You lied to me!

14:07.480 --> 14:09.916
- Ugh.
- Ah!

14:09.950 --> 14:12.052
You said I had a choice!

14:12.085 --> 14:14.454
And I chose to keep him alive,
and yet he died!

14:14.487 --> 14:16.022
Tell me why he died. Tell me!

14:16.056 --> 14:18.525
Perhaps because he, like me,
does not believe in magic.

14:18.558 --> 14:21.962
He knew his death
was what you truly wanted.

14:21.995 --> 14:22.963
No!

14:22.996 --> 14:24.297
No, I didn't want it. I didn't!

14:24.331 --> 14:27.367
Yes, you did.

14:27.400 --> 14:30.237
Because you knew in death
he would belong to you

14:30.270 --> 14:32.939
as he never had in life.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.544
Ah.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.083
My child.

14:47.587 --> 14:50.023
You wanted to speak with me?

14:50.056 --> 14:52.292
I did. I do.

14:54.928 --> 14:56.396
How is the new king, hm?

14:56.429 --> 15:00.133
Well, he's...
overwhelmed by grief.

15:00.166 --> 15:03.370
- <i>Mm.</i>
- Understandably.

15:03.403 --> 15:06.673
Well, he's lucky he has you
when he's so reduced.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.342
I have sworn my loyalty
to him before God.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.311
Nothing can come between us.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.014
- Indeed.
- Yes, and on that subject,

15:14.047 --> 15:17.083
I believe that God
has chosen you and your husband

15:17.117 --> 15:18.985
for a reason.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.954
<i>Together, we can unite Europe</i>

15:20.987 --> 15:24.357
under the one true faith.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.059
Well, if it is my calling,
I shall answer.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.429
Oh, I very much believe
it is your calling, Mary,

15:29.462 --> 15:31.931
and I want to help you.

15:31.965 --> 15:35.502
But--but might the other
members of the Privy Council

15:35.535 --> 15:37.203
not object to such an alliance?

15:37.237 --> 15:39.172
Yes. They might.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.142
But you must remember
that anybody who opposes you

15:42.175 --> 15:43.977
is not to be trusted,

15:44.010 --> 15:46.546
<i>no matter what they profess
their beliefs to be.</i>

15:46.579 --> 15:48.548
Yes.

15:48.581 --> 15:51.251
If they oppose me,
they oppose the church itself.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.286
Exactly.

16:07.200 --> 16:09.602
The embalmers
removed the king's heart.

16:12.105 --> 16:13.306
So I took it.

16:30.056 --> 16:31.257
Drink.

16:38.264 --> 16:41.134
You will be his living tomb.

17:33.620 --> 17:34.788
<i>Hep.</i>

17:35.789 --> 17:37.390
<i>With the death of her husband,</i>

17:37.424 --> 17:39.292
<i>Catherine finally got
the revenge</i>

17:39.325 --> 17:41.494
<i>she had so long desired.</i>

17:47.600 --> 17:49.202
You still have me.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.471
I will never leave you.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.373
Don't say things
you don't mean.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.163
I should remind you that white

18:17.197 --> 18:18.565
is the traditional color
for mourning.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.238
I prefer black.

18:25.271 --> 18:27.273
Reminds people of their loss.

18:28.808 --> 18:31.444
Did Ruggieri tell you that?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.446
He did.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.381
I think it's time
you sent Ruggieri back

18:35.415 --> 18:37.150
to where he came from.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.518
Don't you?

18:40.186 --> 18:41.855
He makes you nervous.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.690
He makes me nervous
because he appeals

18:43.723 --> 18:46.226
to the darker parts
of your nature,

18:46.259 --> 18:48.428
which frighten me
far more than he does.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.297
The darker parts of my nature

18:51.331 --> 18:53.666
will always ensure
my survival...

18:55.535 --> 18:57.604
...and yours.

18:57.637 --> 19:00.173
Bit too soon to tell, isn't it?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.197
Your father always believed
in you.

19:25.565 --> 19:28.368
I know you will
do his memory justice.

19:28.401 --> 19:30.703
Thank you, Mother.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.772
I hope you're right.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.375
I don't doubt it.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.425
Grief suits you.

19:52.458 --> 19:54.928
It has enhanced
your natural beauty.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.864
I only wish I could stay and...

19:57.897 --> 20:00.667
get to know you better.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.535
Is that an appropriate way
to talk to me

20:02.569 --> 20:04.837
at my husband's funeral?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.573
Why not?

20:06.606 --> 20:08.675
You're no longer attached.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.843
And from what I hear,

20:10.877 --> 20:13.813
the marriage wasn't
a particularly happy one

20:13.846 --> 20:15.582
to begin with, hm?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.586
I thought I felt a little
something between us

20:19.619 --> 20:20.954
at the service.

20:22.522 --> 20:24.324
You were wrong.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.793
In fact, the thought
makes me physically ill.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.728
Hm.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.730
What a shame.

20:30.763 --> 20:32.632
The truth is,

20:32.665 --> 20:35.969
I always found funerals...

20:36.002 --> 20:38.471
vaguely erotic.

20:38.504 --> 20:43.009
I think it must be all those
big feelings on display, hm?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.311
You know,
you're the most intelligent one

20:45.345 --> 20:48.348
in the whole dreary group.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.950
Sadly,
you will never see power.

20:51.684 --> 20:54.387
You would have made
a worthy adversary.

20:55.688 --> 20:58.391
If I were you,
I'd leave France immediately.

20:58.424 --> 21:00.760
You are no longer welcome.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.895
I can only thank God

21:02.929 --> 21:04.864
that these terrible events
have disrupted

21:04.897 --> 21:07.400
any treaty negotiations
between our two countries.

21:07.433 --> 21:09.902
Oh, on the contrary...

21:09.936 --> 21:11.504
I think you'll find
the king's death

21:11.537 --> 21:14.707
has only strengthened your
daughter-in-law's determination

21:14.741 --> 21:18.044
to lead
a unified, Catholic Europe,

21:18.277 --> 21:21.881
something I have
encouraged enthusiastically.

21:21.914 --> 21:25.918
A child with a sense
of religious destiny

21:25.952 --> 21:27.420
is like a four-year-old

21:27.453 --> 21:29.789
running around a barn
with a lit torch.

21:33.726 --> 21:36.429
I will wind her up

21:36.462 --> 21:37.930
and watch that silly girl

21:37.964 --> 21:40.933
burn this country
to the ground.

21:42.802 --> 21:46.572
My only regret
is my old friend Francis

21:46.606 --> 21:49.842
will not be here
to see my victory.

21:51.744 --> 21:55.515
Well, I will leave you
to your grief.

21:55.548 --> 21:58.551
As I said, it suits you.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.583
Find out where Montmorency goes
when he's not in court.

22:30.616 --> 22:33.119
He did not cross himself
at the end of mass.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.821
As you wish.

22:44.530 --> 22:46.432
Ah, ah, ah...

22:46.466 --> 22:47.700
ah, ah...

22:49.368 --> 22:50.636
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

23:03.683 --> 23:05.551
I shouldn't come here anymore.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.487
Why not?

23:07.520 --> 23:09.422
It's not every day you meet
someone who likes to take it

23:09.455 --> 23:11.891
exactly the way
you like to give it.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.926
It's no small thing, you know.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.495
Not to be sniffed at.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.864
You make too much of sex

23:17.897 --> 23:20.466
and the sensual pleasures
in general.

23:20.500 --> 23:22.034
What else is there in a world
where you're lucky

23:22.068 --> 23:23.636
to get out
of the birth canal alive

23:23.669 --> 23:26.773
and you can drop dead
from a head cold at any moment?

23:26.806 --> 23:28.908
Listen.

23:28.941 --> 23:32.145
Things will go badly for you
and your brother from now on.

23:32.178 --> 23:35.014
Now, perhaps
this makes me weak, but...

23:35.047 --> 23:37.884
I can't afford
any confusion of loyalties.

23:37.917 --> 23:41.420
I'm flattered you think
confusion is a possibility.

23:41.454 --> 23:43.189
It's not.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.024
You'll regret this.

23:45.057 --> 23:46.993
Despite your best attempts
with me,

23:47.026 --> 23:48.895
you almost resemble
a human being.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.565
You're not going
to get emotional, are you?

23:52.598 --> 23:54.801
I haven't decided.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.202
I might, actually.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.804
Look, it's impossible.

23:57.837 --> 23:59.906
Our families despise
each other.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.674
And we're probably
related anyway.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.509
Everyone's related!

24:04.844 --> 24:06.512
True.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.947
Goodbye, Antoine.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.549
<i>Good luck.</i>

24:13.920 --> 24:16.022
<i>After the Holy Roman
emperor alerted me</i>

24:16.055 --> 24:18.224
<i>to my calling,
I knew it was my duty</i>

24:18.457 --> 24:20.993
<i>to put France
on the right course.</i>

24:21.027 --> 24:23.529
My first order of business
is to discuss the new alliance

24:23.563 --> 24:25.164
between France
and the Holy Roman emperor

24:25.198 --> 24:28.100
in order to secure my wife's
claim on the English throne.

24:28.968 --> 24:30.837
<i>We are prepared
to consider an alliance,</i>

24:30.870 --> 24:32.638
but we'll need
to hear the terms.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.106
Quite. We're not writing
a blank check.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.474
<i>No, no, no.</i>

24:35.508 --> 24:36.475
<i>I think you're
misunderstanding.</i>

24:36.509 --> 24:38.010
The alliance is happening.

24:38.044 --> 24:39.779
It's already been drafted
by the king's hand.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.747
Without the approval
of his Privy Council?

24:41.781 --> 24:42.882
<i>Seriously,
how do you think that will</i>

24:42.915 --> 24:43.950
<i>go over with the Protestants?</i>

24:43.983 --> 24:44.951
Interesting you say that.

24:44.984 --> 24:46.586
What exactly is going on here?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.154
- Yeah.
- France has decided

24:48.187 --> 24:49.622
to take her place in history.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.858
Think is absurd.
Montmorency, tell them.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.559
Montmorency
has no part in this.

24:53.593 --> 24:54.861
The emperor has agreed

24:54.894 --> 24:56.596
to pledge his troops
to our cause,

24:56.629 --> 24:59.699
<i>forging a mighty alliance
that will strike terror</i>

24:59.732 --> 25:02.034
in the hearts
of every last infidel,

25:02.068 --> 25:04.570
in exchange for a reassurance
of our religious purity.

25:04.604 --> 25:07.540
And how do you propose
we do that, child?

25:07.573 --> 25:09.141
A decree that makes
Protestantism illegal

25:09.175 --> 25:10.142
on French soil.

25:11.744 --> 25:13.980
I-Is this a joke?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.515
Francis, this is not wise.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.751
It's fucking lunacy,
is what it is.

25:18.784 --> 25:20.853
Are you behind this?
'Cause it's not fucking funny.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.855
I'm not laughing.

25:22.889 --> 25:24.757
Listen to me, Francis.

25:24.790 --> 25:28.060
The Holy Roman emperor plagued
your grandfather's reign.

25:28.094 --> 25:31.130
He imprisoned and tortured
your father and uncle

25:31.163 --> 25:32.164
when they were children.

25:33.299 --> 25:35.001
<i>You cannot trust him.</i>

25:36.569 --> 25:37.870
Fucking...

25:39.005 --> 25:41.607
Forgive me, Mother, if I'm
not swayed by your advice.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.142
But you never had much
to say to me before.

25:43.175 --> 25:44.677
Why should our relationship
change now?

25:44.710 --> 25:45.745
And yet, in this case,

25:45.778 --> 25:47.546
your mother
happens to be right.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.782
This is a very dangerous road
you're going down.

25:49.815 --> 25:52.184
The righteous path
is always rife with danger.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.721
Francis, I'm your mother,

25:55.755 --> 25:57.223
and I only want to protect you.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.125
Yet you left that to others
in the past.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.693
Never my choice.

26:00.726 --> 26:03.863
May I just say
that we're not cruel.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.932
Hm? In fact,

26:05.965 --> 26:08.067
due to the Bourbons'
loyal service to the crown,

26:08.100 --> 26:10.102
we have decided
to give them the opportunity

26:10.136 --> 26:11.637
to renounce their Protestantism

26:11.671 --> 26:13.806
and recommit themself
to the Catholic faith.

26:13.839 --> 26:15.808
- After paying a hefty fee.
- And I'd be really,

26:15.841 --> 26:17.977
really happy
to take your confession.

26:18.010 --> 26:19.946
- What, now?
- Yes.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.949
I'm sorry, but why is a virgin
who has never read anything

26:22.982 --> 26:24.717
but children's stories
talking to me?

26:24.750 --> 26:26.285
I told you before
not to speak to her like that.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.320
I won't tell you again.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.588
- Shut up.
- This will mean war.

26:29.622 --> 26:31.357
In which case, you will
honor your king in battle.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.795
Then you won't renounce, hm?

26:35.828 --> 26:36.862
Fuck off.

26:36.896 --> 26:38.698
Fine.

26:38.731 --> 26:40.232
Sign it.

26:44.870 --> 26:48.140
You are now in violation
of a royal decree.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.942
And what are you going to do,
arrest us?

26:49.976 --> 26:51.310
Hm, banishment seems
more appropriate.

26:51.344 --> 26:52.845
- Does it not, my king?
- Yes.

26:52.878 --> 26:54.680
- Banishment.
- You can't do this.

26:54.714 --> 26:56.148
I think you'll find
we just have.

26:56.182 --> 26:58.117
Uh, guards, please see
the Princes of the Blood

26:58.150 --> 26:59.285
out of the palace at once.

26:59.318 --> 27:00.886
Where are we supposed to go?

27:00.920 --> 27:03.089
Siberia.
I hear they've got clean air.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.690
You have made
a terrible mistake.

27:04.724 --> 27:05.925
On the contrary, your son

27:05.958 --> 27:07.660
will be the savior
of Catholic Europe.

27:07.693 --> 27:08.995
- Go.
- You bitch.

27:09.028 --> 27:10.029
<i>Hey, you get your
hands off me!</i>

27:10.062 --> 27:11.630
<i>Fucking bitch.</i>

27:11.664 --> 27:12.865
Just get them out.

27:15.901 --> 27:17.269
I fucked your mother!

27:17.303 --> 27:18.904
I fucked her good and hard.
And you know what?

27:18.938 --> 27:21.841
You were right.
She likes it fucking rough!

27:26.078 --> 27:27.179
I will maim you.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.286
You're next, you fat fuck.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.858
Ah!

27:38.891 --> 27:40.726
- Enough?
- Fuck.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.362
I can still taste
her sweet Catholic cunt.

27:44.964 --> 27:45.965
<i>Get them out.</i>

27:54.974 --> 27:56.409
<i>Having signed
the proclamation,</i>

27:56.442 --> 27:59.145
<i>we wasted no time in our
efforts to rid the kingdom</i>

27:59.178 --> 28:00.846
<i>of the Protestant menace.</i>

28:02.815 --> 28:04.216
What do you want?

28:04.250 --> 28:07.186
We are arresting him
on suspicions of Protestantism.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.888
He's not a Protestant. Are you?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.056
What's a Protestant?

28:10.089 --> 28:11.724
Let him go, or you answer
to the Queen Mother.

28:11.757 --> 28:14.160
We are acting on the orders
of the king.

28:23.102 --> 28:25.004
<i>I never doubted
my husband, the king's,</i>

28:25.037 --> 28:26.405
<i>dedication to the church.</i>

28:26.439 --> 28:28.908
<i>But I knew his mother's
influence could be dangerous</i>

28:28.941 --> 28:31.444
<i>unless she were brought over
to our cause.</i>

28:37.783 --> 28:40.186
Your Majesty,
to what do I owe this honor?

28:40.219 --> 28:44.190
I believe I see the light
of Lord, our savior, in you.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.424
Mm?

28:45.458 --> 28:47.993
He is known to be close
to the afflicted.

28:48.027 --> 28:49.228
Really?

28:49.261 --> 28:51.797
That's not been my experience.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.732
Then perhaps you have not found
the right path.

28:54.834 --> 28:56.936
What did you have in mind?

28:56.969 --> 28:59.972
<i>Your mistress has
a magician in her retinue.</i>

29:00.005 --> 29:02.408
Rumor has it, he has lured her
over to the dark arts,

29:02.441 --> 29:03.509
and you disapprove.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.379
Even if that were true...

29:07.413 --> 29:09.315
I don't see
why I would tell you.

29:09.348 --> 29:11.283
The laws are very strict

29:11.317 --> 29:13.052
when it comes to heresy
of any kind,

29:13.085 --> 29:16.222
and I would hate to see
your mistress led astray.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.958
So if you come see me
with the information I need,

29:18.991 --> 29:20.759
I will make sure
you don't suffer

29:20.793 --> 29:22.228
for your mistress' crimes.

29:27.233 --> 29:28.200
Are we understood?

29:32.872 --> 29:34.039
Good.

30:07.406 --> 30:08.574
Aabis?

30:08.807 --> 30:09.975
I need your help.

30:10.009 --> 30:11.010
I'm not in much of a position

30:11.043 --> 30:12.978
to help anyone, I'm afraid.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.346
They took my apprentice,

30:14.380 --> 30:15.514
arrested him for heresy.

30:15.548 --> 30:16.815
Well, so get a new one.

30:16.849 --> 30:18.417
I happen to need him.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.985
Why?

30:20.019 --> 30:21.587
What makes him so special?

30:21.820 --> 30:23.155
He has no one else
in the world.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.291
And he's attached himself
to me.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.861
I'll see what I can do.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.900
What was that about?

30:34.934 --> 30:36.535
Nothing that concerns you.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.338
I have the information
you asked for.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.342
Tell me.

30:43.375 --> 30:46.278
First I have my future
to think about.

30:46.312 --> 30:47.513
What is it that you want?

30:51.217 --> 30:53.052
I want my freedom,

30:53.085 --> 30:55.254
away from court
and all the power plays

30:55.287 --> 30:57.256
that consume you so much.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.558
Do you think I enjoy this game?

30:59.592 --> 31:01.627
I think what you claim
to do out of necessity

31:01.860 --> 31:05.064
brings you more pleasure
than you'd like to admit.

31:05.097 --> 31:07.933
Now that Henri is dead
and your children are grown,

31:07.967 --> 31:09.468
you could leave court,

31:09.501 --> 31:12.037
live in peaceful obscurity.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.306
But you won't.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.009
You'll say it is for France,

31:17.042 --> 31:18.644
but I know better.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.914
How sad.

31:23.282 --> 31:26.619
My dearest and oldest friend...

31:28.287 --> 31:29.622
...how little you know of me.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.157
You sure about that?

31:33.192 --> 31:35.995
I suggest you do not
underestimate me.

31:37.196 --> 31:39.098
Never.

31:52.411 --> 31:55.381
<i>"Wherefore the law
was our schoolmaster</i>

31:55.414 --> 31:57.516
"to bring us unto Christ,

31:57.549 --> 32:00.986
that we might be justified
by faith."

32:06.025 --> 32:08.260
"But after that faith is come,

32:08.294 --> 32:11.297
"we are no longer
under a schoolmaster.

32:11.330 --> 32:13.565
"For ye are all
the children of God

32:13.599 --> 32:16.368
<i>"by faith in Christ Jesus.</i>

32:16.402 --> 32:18.971
<i>"For as many of you
as have been baptized...</i>

32:19.004 --> 32:21.507
Dangerous pastime these days.

32:23.108 --> 32:26.278
<i>"There is no longer
Jew or Greek..."</i>

32:26.312 --> 32:28.047
I wonder
what would possess you.

32:29.515 --> 32:31.050
Have you really found God?

32:36.322 --> 32:37.690
Thank you.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.565
Not today.

32:50.069 --> 32:52.304
Mmm. It's the girl, isn't it?

32:52.338 --> 32:54.273
Not in the way you mean.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.407
<i>Thank you.</i>

32:55.441 --> 32:57.176
She changed my life,

32:57.209 --> 32:58.477
gave me a purpose.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.380
The only pure thing I've ever
seen in this world.

33:01.413 --> 33:03.716
Like a true Christian.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.618
<i>Thank you.</i>

33:06.652 --> 33:07.653
What is it you want?

33:09.688 --> 33:12.057
Same thing that you do,

33:12.091 --> 33:13.592
peace.

33:13.625 --> 33:15.427
A future where a girl like that

33:15.461 --> 33:17.429
need not be afraid
for her life.

33:17.463 --> 33:20.265
<i>Help me restore balance
to the country.</i>

33:20.299 --> 33:22.334
You know it as well as I do.

33:22.368 --> 33:24.436
It is what
King Francis taught us.

33:24.470 --> 33:26.505
You, perhaps. Me, he sent away.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.673
And I'm calling you back.

33:27.706 --> 33:30.376
Because France needs you.

33:30.409 --> 33:34.079
Unless you're prepared to be
the next person Mary hangs.

33:34.113 --> 33:36.281
Everyone dies of something.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.350
Is a hanging any worse
than another?

33:40.052 --> 33:42.020
What about the girl?

33:42.054 --> 33:43.622
And everyone else in here?

33:44.790 --> 33:46.291
Protect them.

33:47.659 --> 33:51.029
Help me show my son reason.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.065
You used to be a man of action.

33:53.098 --> 33:55.067
It's time to act.

34:04.676 --> 34:07.579
Your poor mother.

34:07.613 --> 34:10.048
You know, it'll break her heart
when she finds out.

34:10.082 --> 34:13.585
When I think of the sacrifices
she made for you.

34:13.619 --> 34:15.654
Perhaps we could
tell her we're just, uh,

34:15.687 --> 34:18.123
- coming home to visit.
- Yeah.

34:18.157 --> 34:19.425
It's only a matter of time.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.794
She'll hear about it
in the village.

34:21.827 --> 34:24.329
The way those women
like to natter on.

34:24.363 --> 34:27.065
They'll love to lord it over us
with this.

34:27.099 --> 34:30.235
The Bourbon boys in exile.

34:31.470 --> 34:34.139
Well, we all have
to face facts eventually.

34:34.173 --> 34:37.075
You had one job:
maintain influence.

34:37.109 --> 34:38.510
And you couldn't manage it.

34:38.544 --> 34:41.313
It's true. We're failures.

34:41.346 --> 34:43.415
I can barely comprehend
how it happened.

34:43.449 --> 34:45.250
Can't you, Louis?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.852
Well, I can.

34:47.085 --> 34:48.220
You're Princes of the Blood,

34:48.253 --> 34:50.222
and you let yourself
be outmaneuvered

34:50.255 --> 34:52.858
by a family of pig fuckers!

34:53.091 --> 34:55.294
- Sorry, Daddy.
- Sorry, Daddy.

34:55.327 --> 34:57.763
We are not pigs

34:57.796 --> 34:59.264
that get fucked!

34:59.298 --> 35:00.866
We are the Bourbons!

35:01.099 --> 35:03.235
And we do the fucking!

35:04.536 --> 35:05.804
No. I've made up my mind.

35:05.838 --> 35:07.506
You can't come home.
I won't allow it.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.408
I didn't spend
my whole life working

35:09.441 --> 35:10.742
to have you two underfoot.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.578
Well, where the hell
are we supposed to go?

35:12.611 --> 35:14.246
I don't know.
Let's have a think.

35:14.279 --> 35:15.380
There's always Navarre.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.448
You happen to be
King there, Antoine.

35:16.482 --> 35:17.549
- Oh...
- I can't. I--

35:17.583 --> 35:19.485
Protestantism
is the state religion.

35:19.518 --> 35:22.254
And last time I checked,
you had a wife there too.

35:22.287 --> 35:23.255
She's awful.

35:23.288 --> 35:24.857
I mean, I fucking hate Navarre.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.359
No music, no wine.
The food is shit.

35:27.392 --> 35:28.594
Yeah, it is.

35:28.627 --> 35:30.195
<i>Right,
I'm giving you two weeks.</i>

35:30.229 --> 35:31.630
<i>Then I don't care
where you go.</i>

35:31.663 --> 35:32.831
I'm not going to Navarre.

35:32.865 --> 35:35.367
- I can't.
- No, you can't.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.336
- Who's that?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

35:40.639 --> 35:42.741
Then again...

35:42.774 --> 35:45.878
there may be another option
after all.

35:52.351 --> 35:54.353
Ah, Montmorency,

35:54.386 --> 35:57.456
to what do we owe the honor
of your visit?

35:57.489 --> 36:00.225
<i>We need you
to return to court,</i>

36:00.259 --> 36:02.761
to reclaim your rightful seats
on the Privy Council,

36:02.794 --> 36:06.532
with all your titles
and holdings restored.

36:06.565 --> 36:07.599
We'd like nothing better,

36:07.633 --> 36:09.768
but how do you propose
we do that?

36:09.801 --> 36:12.404
We're exiles, on the run.

36:12.437 --> 36:14.806
Without a purpose in life.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.442
About to join
the trash heap of history.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.810
You must forgive
my younger son.

36:18.844 --> 36:21.747
He is having something
of an existential crisis.

36:21.780 --> 36:23.715
Pay him no mind.

36:23.749 --> 36:26.385
But seriously,
do you have a plan?

36:26.418 --> 36:27.953
Yes.

36:28.186 --> 36:30.289
Separate the king
from Mary's influence.

36:30.322 --> 36:32.424
He worships her,
if you hadn't noticed.

36:32.457 --> 36:35.627
And that is why the separation
must be made by force.

36:35.661 --> 36:37.496
Some time alone
with his Protestant uncles

36:37.529 --> 36:41.366
to remind him of the benefits
of religious tolerance.

36:41.400 --> 36:43.902
Sounds quite practical.

36:43.936 --> 36:45.203
<i>Thank you, Antoine.</i>

36:45.237 --> 36:46.538
You are, if I'm not mistaken,

36:46.572 --> 36:48.607
talking about
kidnapping the king.

36:48.640 --> 36:51.276
There is nothing
remotely practical about it.

36:51.310 --> 36:53.845
Yeah. If the Guises find out,
they will declare war.

36:53.879 --> 36:55.581
<i>The Guises will not find out.</i>

36:56.248 --> 36:57.316
The king will be seized

36:57.349 --> 36:59.952
by unknown
Protestant militants.

36:59.985 --> 37:01.920
You will negotiate his release,

37:01.954 --> 37:03.422
<i>kill the militants,</i>

37:03.455 --> 37:06.792
and return him unharmed
as an act of patriotism,

37:06.825 --> 37:09.561
and therefore proving
to the French people

37:09.595 --> 37:11.296
that the Protestants
have the best interests

37:11.330 --> 37:12.364
of the king at heart.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.866
Sounds risky to me.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.635
<i>Well, you could
always go live in Navarre.</i>

37:16.668 --> 37:18.370
Oh, God, no.

37:18.403 --> 37:20.238
Though it seems very likely
that Mary

37:20.272 --> 37:22.274
and the Holy Roman emperor
will set their sights

37:22.307 --> 37:23.976
on the Protestant kingdom
before long.

37:25.277 --> 37:27.613
Father, what do you think?

37:28.747 --> 37:30.816
Montmorency,

37:30.849 --> 37:33.318
if my sons separate the king
from his wife,

37:33.352 --> 37:34.453
will his eyes be opened?

37:35.854 --> 37:37.789
<i>Frankly, I'm not sure.</i>

37:37.823 --> 37:40.525
I don't believe in him
the way his mother does,

37:40.559 --> 37:42.794
but it might be
your only chance.

37:44.863 --> 37:46.598
All right.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.601
It's bold. It's risky.

37:49.635 --> 37:52.371
From one point of view,
it's profoundly stupid.

37:52.904 --> 37:55.907
From another... inspired.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.578
Because the people are angry.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.780
<i>And if we manage
to pull this off,</i>

38:01.813 --> 38:05.384
we could win their hearts
and minds and perhaps...

38:05.417 --> 38:07.519
come out on top after all.

38:09.287 --> 38:11.323
<i>I like it.</i>

38:11.356 --> 38:13.892
And if it doesn't work,
I'm fucking converting back.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.396
So how--

38:17.429 --> 38:19.398
how does one kidnap a king?

38:21.066 --> 38:22.834
In a few days' time,

38:22.868 --> 38:24.703
the king will travel
with a limited escort

38:24.736 --> 38:27.506
through the forest
near Chambord.

38:27.539 --> 38:30.776
During the journey,
his carriage will be exposed.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.711
How do you know that?

38:32.744 --> 38:35.347
Because I will make it so.

38:37.082 --> 38:39.351
It has come to my attention

38:39.384 --> 38:40.652
that we have not rooted out

38:40.686 --> 38:42.020
all of the Protestants
in France.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.357
There is, in fact,
a secret cell

38:45.390 --> 38:46.758
practicing the heathen faith

38:46.792 --> 38:49.828
not far
from where we sit right now.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.764
Its members may even
include certain...

38:52.798 --> 38:55.734
<i>high-ranking court officials.</i>

38:55.767 --> 38:58.036
<i>The location
of this secret cell</i>

38:58.070 --> 38:59.571
<i>has been delivered to me</i>

38:59.604 --> 39:00.939
<i>through a trusted source.</i>

39:02.708 --> 39:04.776
We must punish these traitors
at once.

39:04.810 --> 39:05.911
Mary, I must caution you--

39:05.944 --> 39:07.946
Queen Mary, Uncle,

39:07.979 --> 39:10.048
or Your Majesty, if you prefer.

39:10.082 --> 39:11.750
Your Majesty,

39:11.783 --> 39:13.485
too much blood's
been spilled already.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.520
It's possible
to push the people too far.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.457
They've seen their countrymen
hanging from trees.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.625
Now, it's one thing
to arrest wealthy Protestants

39:20.659 --> 39:23.662
and another to continually
attack the peasantry.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.063
I think our point
has been made.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.932
Well, I'm not interested
in making a point.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.901
I'm interested in ridding
France of every last infidel,

39:29.935 --> 39:31.436
no matter where I find them,

39:31.470 --> 39:33.472
because the future of Europe
depends on it.

39:36.908 --> 39:41.480
The people will not question
the policy...

39:41.513 --> 39:45.550
if they know the king himself
is firmly behind it.

39:45.584 --> 39:47.052
Yes.

39:47.085 --> 39:48.820
Well said.

39:48.854 --> 39:51.156
I did not expect your support.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.592
But we are glad for it.

39:53.625 --> 39:55.127
Are we not, my king?

39:55.160 --> 39:56.161
Hm?

39:56.394 --> 39:57.863
- Yes.
- Indeed.

39:59.765 --> 40:04.436
We must find a way
to demonstrate

40:04.469 --> 40:07.139
the king's commitment
to the new policy.

40:08.540 --> 40:10.108
All right, then.
Here's what we'll do.

40:10.142 --> 40:11.710
Me and my brother
will go and visit

40:11.743 --> 40:13.445
this secret sect ourselves.

40:13.478 --> 40:14.579
We will see to it.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.414
No.

40:16.448 --> 40:18.016
No. The king should lead us

40:18.049 --> 40:19.518
and confront the infidels himself,

40:19.551 --> 40:21.453
because that sends a message--
a clear message.

40:21.486 --> 40:23.455
That's right,
but the problem is--

40:23.488 --> 40:24.656
I'm not sure the king
is up to it.

40:24.689 --> 40:25.657
Exactly.

40:27.592 --> 40:29.461
Do not doubt his resolve.

40:29.494 --> 40:32.430
I want the people to know
where I stand on this issue.

40:32.464 --> 40:33.198
And they do.

40:35.700 --> 40:37.736
I-it's true, my breathing
sometimes gives me difficulty,

40:37.769 --> 40:38.737
but I am not feeble.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.105
Of course, Your Majesty.

40:40.138 --> 40:42.541
But this is a very,
very dangerous situation.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.476
With all due respect,
the king is sick.

40:44.509 --> 40:45.577
No. The king is fine.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.878
He--

40:46.912 --> 40:49.981
Francis, it's all right, hm?

40:50.015 --> 40:51.783
It's all right. Yeah?

40:53.151 --> 40:54.586
Mm?

40:54.619 --> 40:55.620
<i>Yeah?</i>

40:56.988 --> 40:58.123
You're all right.

40:58.156 --> 40:59.191
I am well.

40:59.224 --> 41:01.726
He is well.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.595
You know,
perhaps it is your resolve

41:03.628 --> 41:05.230
that should be questioned, hm?

41:05.463 --> 41:08.099
It has been said
that even the Catholic Church

41:08.133 --> 41:10.502
is not free of heretics,
and I warn you,

41:10.535 --> 41:11.837
I will leave no stone unturned.

41:11.870 --> 41:14.606
You are either with us,
or you are against us.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.045
We are with you.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.485
Of course.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.727
Come, Francis.

41:43.835 --> 41:45.170
Okay, what are you playing at?

41:45.203 --> 41:47.939
He is in no condition
to do something like this.

41:47.973 --> 41:49.140
<i>True.</i>

41:50.008 --> 41:52.177
But he has God on his side.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.194
<i>You better know
what you're doing.</i>

42:09.227 --> 42:11.029
'Cause our niece
is out of fucking control,

42:11.062 --> 42:13.164
- if you hadn't noticed.
- Just leave it to me.

42:13.198 --> 42:15.133
I'll manage it.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.602
That's what I'm worried about.

42:17.636 --> 42:19.638
Another one
puffed up by Mother...

42:19.671 --> 42:21.673
and now the Holy Roman emperor.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.744
Mary thinks she's
Joan of fucking Arc.

43:01.646 --> 43:02.981
Francis...

43:04.883 --> 43:06.851
...I must ask you
to reconsider your alliance

43:06.885 --> 43:08.320
with the Holy Roman emperor.

43:08.353 --> 43:10.255
And why would he do that?

43:10.288 --> 43:11.957
Hm?

43:11.990 --> 43:13.758
We've been over this.

43:13.792 --> 43:15.627
Francis, please.

43:15.660 --> 43:17.062
I must ask you to reconsider

43:17.095 --> 43:18.763
before we reach
our destination.

43:18.797 --> 43:21.299
Or what happens
at our destination, Mother?

43:21.333 --> 43:22.334
I just don't want
to see anything

43:22.367 --> 43:23.835
happen to you, that's all.

43:23.868 --> 43:25.003
Is that a threat?

43:25.036 --> 43:26.137
Of course not.

43:37.882 --> 43:40.085
You doubt my ability to lead,
don't you?

43:40.118 --> 43:42.020
<i>You have never believed in me
the way Father did</i>

43:42.053 --> 43:43.655
or the way Mary does.

43:43.688 --> 43:45.724
She has always
been there for me.

43:45.757 --> 43:47.659
We can discuss
all of that later,

43:47.692 --> 43:48.927
if you will only
listen to me now.

44:06.111 --> 44:07.345
No wonder father loved Diane.

44:07.379 --> 44:09.047
<i>You could never give him
the love he needed.</i>

44:09.080 --> 44:11.416
You were cold.
I have felt it all my life.

44:11.649 --> 44:14.152
Possessed of the black heart,
just as they say.

44:14.185 --> 44:15.153
You know,
I've even wondered if it's

44:15.186 --> 44:16.254
the blackness in your heart

44:16.287 --> 44:18.056
that caused me
to be born so sickly,

44:18.089 --> 44:21.092
<i>if that's the real reason they
call you the Serpent Queen.</i>

44:25.230 --> 44:27.065
Francis. It's all right.

44:27.098 --> 44:28.900
Help, help, help. Please.

44:28.933 --> 44:30.101
<i>Please, please, help.</i>

44:30.135 --> 44:32.771
Please. Please. Francis.

44:39.978 --> 44:43.381
Indirectly or not, I believe
Catherine was responsible

44:43.415 --> 44:47.285
<i>for what happened
to my husband, the king.</i>

44:50.288 --> 44:52.957
Well, now you know
why you must choose my side.

44:58.463 --> 45:00.832
Thank you for opening my eyes.

45:06.871 --> 45:09.741
I feel my soul cleansed.

45:13.378 --> 45:17.248
I wrote to my cousin in England
asking for help.

45:17.282 --> 45:18.883
If there's one thing
that can unite us,

45:18.917 --> 45:21.786
it is our hatred
of that common queen.

45:23.755 --> 45:24.989
I believe Catherine

45:25.023 --> 45:28.026
has intercepted
her letter in return.

45:29.294 --> 45:31.262
I need it back.

45:31.296 --> 45:32.997
<i>You can find it.</i>

45:35.433 --> 45:37.102
Can I count on you?

45:37.869 --> 45:39.337
It would be my honor

45:39.370 --> 45:42.307
to help you rid France
of the Serpent Queen.

45:42.340 --> 45:43.875
Good.

46:11.536 --> 46:15.140
<i>Find him,
and bring him to me.</i>

46:15.173 --> 46:17.509
Move, posthaste.

46:17.542 --> 46:19.511
Yes, Your Majesty.

46:24.249 --> 46:26.251
I didn't hear you come in.

46:28.353 --> 46:30.355
I came as soon as I could.

46:32.023 --> 46:34.025
Queen Mary let you go.

46:35.326 --> 46:36.294
Why?

46:37.128 --> 46:39.797
I told her a pack of lies
about you.

46:39.831 --> 46:40.965
Now she trusts me.

46:43.568 --> 46:46.371
She even gave me this dress.

46:46.404 --> 46:48.406
I'm not surprised.

46:50.041 --> 46:52.343
You're a clever girl.

46:55.480 --> 46:57.815
Are you angry with me?

46:57.849 --> 47:00.018
Of course not.

47:00.051 --> 47:01.352
You are my friend.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.354
Indeed.

47:03.388 --> 47:06.491
And you have learned
a valuable lesson,

47:06.524 --> 47:09.327
that a queen never lacks
a legitimate reason

47:09.360 --> 47:10.595
to break a promise.

47:17.969 --> 47:20.405
Shall I prepare you a bath?

47:20.438 --> 47:22.840
