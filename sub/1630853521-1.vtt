09:19.960 --> 09:21.376
With a pair of sneakers
in your hand.

09:22.713 --> 09:24.912
But listen, I'll keep working
on the da.

09:25.015 --> 09:26.881
Hopefully not having a record
will help us.

09:31.521 --> 09:32.604
-[sherri] beautiful.

09:32.723 --> 09:34.639

[kisses]

09:38.061 --> 09:39.311
hi. Betsy flick.

09:39.396 --> 09:41.896
I was sent over
for the stenographer position.

09:41.982 --> 09:43.448
-Sherri kansky, right?
-Yes.

09:43.567 --> 09:44.816
Heard a lot of great things
about you.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.768
It would be a real honor
to work with you.

09:46.870 --> 09:48.269
Really? An honor.

10:07.424 --> 10:08.923

are you doing on the floor?

10:09.009 --> 10:12.126
Well, when you're done
with whatever,
come see me, please.

10:38.488 --> 10:40.572
this gift giving
has got to stop.

10:42.459 --> 10:43.992
Dangerous beauty?

10:45.162 --> 10:46.244
Callan.

10:46.330 --> 10:47.695
Have you narrowed down
your selection?

10:47.798 --> 10:50.715
Picking troy's replacement
as head deputy da should not
be my job.

10:50.834 --> 10:52.217
Ooh, airpods.

10:52.336 --> 10:53.551
-Not bad.
-You're enjoying this,
aren't you?

10:53.670 --> 10:56.171
Look, I asked if you'd take
the job, you refused.

10:56.256 --> 10:57.839
-[mark sighs]
-now it's your choice.

10:57.924 --> 11:00.558
My choice would be you never
should've gotten rid of troy
in the first place.

11:00.677 --> 11:01.926
-I didn't, he was promoted.
-Yeah,

11:02.012 --> 11:04.179
-he was transferred to pomona.
-I would suggest

11:04.264 --> 11:07.048
you pick troy's successor
sooner rather than later

11:07.150 --> 11:09.768
or stop being difficult
and just take
the job yourself.

11:11.855 --> 11:12.687
Hmm.

11:14.191 --> 11:16.057
[ness] okay, higher.

11:16.159 --> 11:18.943
Down the way.
Yeah, switch to the left.

11:19.029 --> 11:21.079
-A little more.
-Would you like to ask
what I think?

11:21.198 --> 11:22.364
No, I'm good.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.615
-You got a problem with it?
-No.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.400
It looks great, in fact.

11:25.502 --> 11:27.235
Mmm, turn her on.

11:27.337 --> 11:31.423
[laughs] perfect.
Thank you, guys, so much.
I appreciate you.

11:31.541 --> 11:33.908
In the future, I would love
to be consulted first.

11:34.010 --> 11:35.043
Yeah, I did call you,
but you didn't answer.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.744
-I don't think--
-and then I facetimed rachel

11:36.847 --> 11:38.096
and got her
on the way to court.

11:38.215 --> 11:39.631
Although the dc traffic
did sound a lot like
caribbean waves,

11:39.716 --> 11:41.883
but I digress, I did
my due diligence,

11:41.968 --> 11:43.751
and consulted the powers
that be.

11:43.854 --> 11:46.921
-And voila.
-Rachel happen to mention
when she was returning?

11:47.023 --> 11:49.391
No, but she did say
something about the case
she was working on

11:49.476 --> 11:51.259
somehow raining down
money on the firm.

11:51.361 --> 11:52.944
[sighs] she always says that.

11:53.063 --> 11:57.115
Well, I will just be happy
when you are able to take on
new clients.

11:57.234 --> 12:00.435
Though, I appreciate
all of the organizing, filing,

12:00.537 --> 12:03.238
calling and everything
you're doing
to keep us afloat.

12:06.376 --> 12:07.375
[laughs]

12:08.745 --> 12:12.080
lisa, should I worry
corrine cuthbert
never conceded...

12:12.165 --> 12:15.450
Judge carmichael,
I want you to meet
judge thomas marshall.

12:15.552 --> 12:18.002
The infamous judge
lola carmichael.

12:18.088 --> 12:20.422
[laughs] infamous,
I wouldn't quite
put it like that.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.890
[thomas] your reputation
precedes you.

12:22.426 --> 12:23.641

12:23.760 --> 12:25.977
Congratulations
on retaining this seat
at the 11th hour.

12:26.096 --> 12:28.629
-Thank you, sir.
-I look forward to getting
to know you very well,

12:28.732 --> 12:30.181
so that I can judge
for myself.

12:31.435 --> 12:32.934
A little judicial humor.

12:33.019 --> 12:33.935
[lola laughs wearily]

12:34.020 --> 12:35.437
talk to you later, lisa.

12:35.939 --> 12:36.855
You bet.

12:38.108 --> 12:40.975
I'm not sure if I'm on
his good side or his bad side.

12:41.077 --> 12:42.160
I wouldn't think
too much on it.

12:42.279 --> 12:44.446
Thomas is a hard one to read.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.197
He can be rough
around the edges,

12:46.283 --> 12:47.365
but he grows on you.

12:47.451 --> 12:49.167
You'll have plenty of time
to figure it out.

12:49.286 --> 12:51.369
-He's joining the fray.
-Really?

12:51.455 --> 12:54.456
Does that have anything
to do with you meeting
with the judicial committee?

12:54.541 --> 12:58.659
News certainly travels fast,
but no, it doesn't.

12:58.762 --> 13:03.715
Just be conservative
in your rulings
in the next few weeks.

13:03.800 --> 13:05.216
What does that even mean?

13:05.302 --> 13:08.803
Corrine cuthbert
challenging your seat
put you on an elevated stage.

13:08.889 --> 13:11.839
-Even more eyes on you.
-Including judge marshall?

13:11.942 --> 13:15.810
All I'm asking is for you
to park the lola coaster
temporarily.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.729
You faced the fire,
rose to the occasion

13:17.814 --> 13:19.614
and came out of it
smelling like a...

13:20.734 --> 13:21.566
...Petunia.

13:21.651 --> 13:22.567
Hmm.

13:23.987 --> 13:25.069
Don't push it.

13:28.909 --> 13:32.827
In my courtroom,
there will be no talking,
no eating.

13:32.913 --> 13:36.631
-Phones must be turned off
or on silent.
-[luke] take a seat.

13:37.801 --> 13:38.800
Be right back.

13:41.087 --> 13:42.086
Maggie.

13:43.139 --> 13:45.039
You cannot keep denying
my client--

13:45.141 --> 13:47.175
you're the one denying
your client, watkins.

13:47.260 --> 13:48.709
You still haven't
made me an offer.

13:48.812 --> 13:50.345
-Assault by means of force.
-Are you kidding me?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.180
The great bodily injury
suffered by the victim?

13:52.265 --> 13:57.101
The kid can either get
a pc 211 robbery
or a pc 245 with gbi.

13:57.187 --> 13:59.103
-Either way it's a strike.
-Maggie, it was
an isolated incident.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.555
What happened
to the store owner

14:00.657 --> 14:02.023
-was an accident, my client
does not have...
-I already told you,

14:02.108 --> 14:03.441
-we're not parading...
-...A police record despite

14:03.527 --> 14:04.859
-growing up in foster care.
-...With a no-strike.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.911
-[growls]
-whoa, wait. Maggie.

14:07.030 --> 14:08.729
Did you just growl at me?

14:08.832 --> 14:10.415
-So you're not gonna
listen to reason.
-[bailiff] mr. Watkins.

14:10.534 --> 14:13.585
Looks like you're the winner
and the first person
to break my rules.

14:13.703 --> 14:15.787
Let's hear it
for mr. Watkins, everybody.

14:15.872 --> 14:17.205

14:30.387 --> 14:32.937
if you had bet me a year ago
we'd be working together
in the da's office,

14:33.056 --> 14:34.422
-I would've lost my shirt.
-[laughs]

14:34.524 --> 14:36.057
-you know what you're getting
yourself into?
-Yeah, you know,

14:36.142 --> 14:38.476
I finished my training,
I shadowed a few victim's
advocates

14:38.562 --> 14:40.395
and I know the job's not easy,

14:40.480 --> 14:43.764
but I am looking forward
to helping victims

14:43.867 --> 14:46.401
-and witnesses
become survivors.
-That's the right attitude.

14:46.486 --> 14:47.819
Just like
your best friend lopez.

14:47.904 --> 14:49.270
-Hmm.
-Welcome.

14:49.372 --> 14:51.823
-So do I get an office or?
-Desk.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.775
-Take your pick.
-Oh.

14:54.878 --> 14:56.794
Oh. Okay.

14:56.913 --> 14:58.746
Maybe I should find
my first assignment.

14:58.832 --> 14:59.947
Tricia ornelas.

15:00.050 --> 15:02.333

-What?
-Good luck.

Now, miss ornelas,
is the person who violently
pushed down your father

15:25.358 --> 15:26.824
-in this room?
-Yes.

15:26.943 --> 15:28.476
-[maggie] can you point him
out for me?
-He's right there at the table

15:28.578 --> 15:29.477
wearing the gray vest.

15:29.579 --> 15:31.095
Identifying the defendant.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.081
-No further questions,
your honor.
-[lola] mr. Watkins.

15:38.254 --> 15:39.504
You said my client
was wearing a mask.

15:39.623 --> 15:41.623
-Yeah.
-And that he was
wearing a hoodie

15:41.708 --> 15:43.041
with the hood
pulled up, right?

15:43.126 --> 15:45.493
-Yeah.
-So are you saying you can
identify my client,

15:45.595 --> 15:48.630
even though his face
was hidden by a mask
and a hoodie?

15:48.715 --> 15:50.632
-No, um, what I'm trying
to say--
-thank you, miss ornelas.

15:50.717 --> 15:53.851
[lola] mr. Watkins,
I don't believe
the witness was finished

15:53.970 --> 15:55.720
answering your
previous question.

15:55.805 --> 15:57.805
Miss ornelas, please continue.

15:59.109 --> 16:02.510
What I was trying to say
is that they scuffled.

16:02.612 --> 16:04.395
My father grabbed him
and pulled down his mask.

16:04.481 --> 16:05.980
That's when I saw his face.

16:10.787 --> 16:11.986
No further questions,
your honor.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.324
[luke sighs]

16:25.952 --> 16:27.385
-what is this?
-My hours.

16:27.504 --> 16:30.421
-I'm not yet
a salaried employee.
-You're also not an attorney.

16:30.507 --> 16:32.090
-What? You're asking
for overtime?
-I ordered

16:32.175 --> 16:34.092
and made sure
all the furniture
was delivered to every office,

16:34.177 --> 16:36.761
updated the firm's website,
updated future firm events.

16:36.846 --> 16:39.564
-I've been busting my butt.
-It's called paying your dues,

16:39.683 --> 16:42.066
-not overtime.
-In my world, I like to call
them expandable hours.

16:42.185 --> 16:44.719
And I appreciate
every expandable hour

16:44.821 --> 16:46.354
you have committed
to this firm.

16:49.859 --> 16:51.743
Practicing law, billable hours

16:51.861 --> 16:54.112

after you pass the bar

16:54.197 --> 16:56.280

as an attorney.

-Objection, your honor.

-Mr. Watkins!
-I ask that the case
be dismissed.

17:40.877 --> 17:42.960
That the defendant
be remanded and bail
set at 2 million

17:43.079 --> 17:45.663
and that he be ordered
forthwith to the arraignment
court.

17:45.749 --> 17:47.081
Your honor, may I confirm
with my client?

17:47.167 --> 17:48.499
-Do that in arraignment court.
-There is nothing
to talk about.

to restrain yourself.

Hold up, I was only 17.

-What?

18:00.847 --> 18:02.296
I'm sorry,
what did you just say?

18:02.398 --> 18:04.098
-I was only 17.
-Your honor, I need time
to confirm that this is true.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.434
-Your honor, the people
will not--
-miss palmer, I will consider

18:06.519 --> 18:08.986
the people's motion to dismiss
and refile murder charges,

18:09.105 --> 18:13.357
in the event the defense
is unable to prove
by a preponderance

18:13.443 --> 18:17.645
of the evidence that mr. Paolo
was, in fact, a juvenile
at the time of the offence.

18:17.747 --> 18:20.331
-Your honor, this is just
a ploy--
-mr. Watkins, I need to see

18:20.450 --> 18:22.700
-proof of your client's age.
-Yeah. Sure.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.170

18:46.860 --> 18:49.911
judge carmichael,
kudos on your epic
comeback from behind.

18:50.029 --> 18:51.779
-Hello, jonas.
-And I thought
you were a goner.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.030
Glad to prove you wrong.

18:53.116 --> 18:55.449
-Me, too.
-Though your support
throughout my campaign

18:55.535 --> 18:56.751
-did surprise me.
-Oh, well.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.235
Someone comes
for a judge's seat,

18:58.338 --> 18:59.704
it's as if they're coming
for us all.

18:59.789 --> 19:01.238
And here I thought
I was special.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.507
Well, you can
go on thinking that.

19:02.592 --> 19:05.242
Just know from now on,
it's back to business
as usual.

19:05.345 --> 19:07.295
-So good to see you. Welcome.
-Oh, nice to see you.

19:08.464 --> 19:09.964
What can you tell me
about him?

19:10.049 --> 19:11.098
-Judge marshall?
-Mmm.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.583
Not much.

19:12.685 --> 19:15.269
Rumor is that he's even
more conservative than I,

19:15.388 --> 19:17.305
which make sense
that he would be
interested in you.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.306
What makes you say that?

19:18.391 --> 19:19.440
He's headed this way.

19:19.559 --> 19:20.892
[thomas clears throat]

19:20.977 --> 19:22.593
hello, judge carmichael.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.028
Judge marshall.

19:24.113 --> 19:26.781
I heard that the defendant
in the courtroom was possibly
a minor.

19:26.900 --> 19:30.151
-Hmm.
-Now I would have to see
irrefutable proof

19:30.236 --> 19:32.453
before dismissing adult
court action.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.821
It seems we think alike.

19:33.907 --> 19:36.908
I will only certify the case
to juvenile court

19:36.993 --> 19:39.544
if the defense proves
he was a minor.

19:41.564 --> 19:42.563
Interesting.

19:48.838 --> 19:50.888
[chuckles] this is gonna
be fun.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.178
Who tells the cops they're 18
when they're actually
a juvenile?

19:57.263 --> 19:59.513
I just didn't want them
calling my foster mom

19:59.599 --> 20:00.848
'cause she's got enough
to deal with.

20:00.934 --> 20:02.800
Me and my brothers
would be bounced around.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.269
-Her house was the first one
that felt like a home.
-You knew

20:05.355 --> 20:07.521
if they thought you were
an adult, they wouldn't call.

20:07.607 --> 20:10.307
I just didn't think lying
about my age was gonna
be a big deal.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.525
You gotta get me
out of here, mr. Watkins.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.278
-Well, do you have someone
that can pay bail?
-No.

20:14.364 --> 20:16.280
-No.
-Well, we need
to prove your age.

20:19.285 --> 20:20.201
So I gotta stay here?

20:22.038 --> 20:23.120
Until I get proof,

20:24.257 --> 20:25.122
you stay.

20:42.141 --> 20:45.726
They're asking insurance,
arrangements.

20:45.812 --> 20:47.361
I can help you talk to them.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.481
Help you with seeking
restitution and finding
other resources.

20:50.566 --> 20:51.399
I thought he was
gonna wake up,

20:53.453 --> 20:56.487
[sniffs] and this whole
nightmare would be over.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.747
it was hard enough
losing my mother to covid.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.500
Now I lose my father
to some senseless robbery.

21:09.585 --> 21:11.168
I know exactly how you feel.

21:11.254 --> 21:12.136
Have you lost a parent too?

21:13.172 --> 21:14.755
No.

21:14.841 --> 21:17.425
You know nothing
of how I feel, ms. Castillo.

21:20.930 --> 21:22.179
You're right.

21:22.265 --> 21:24.982
I want that asshole to pay
for what he took
from my family.

21:27.103 --> 21:29.937
Juvie is too easy,
I want his life
for my father's.

21:38.865 --> 21:39.864

21:41.084 --> 21:42.867
Wow, that got here
a lot faster than I expected.

21:42.952 --> 21:44.535
Have you lost your mind?

21:44.620 --> 21:47.705
This is not how you treat
people who are ultimately
in the position to hire you.

21:47.790 --> 21:49.239
Or recommend you elsewhere.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.959
And though I commend you
for this strategic move,

21:52.045 --> 21:55.429
I would like for you
to point your powers for bad
away from this firm.

21:55.548 --> 21:57.715

the firm can handle it.

about judge thomas marshall.

22:14.901 --> 22:17.318
-Has he said or done anything?
-No.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.453
Not exactly,
but my gut is telling me

22:19.572 --> 22:21.238
that I'm suddenly being
watched from within.

22:21.324 --> 22:22.773
Newsflash, carmichael,
you've been watched

took your seat on the bench.

on my recent case.

22:39.926 --> 22:41.175
Well, you gotta ask yourself
two questions.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.843
One, does she bring
value to the company?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.596
And, two, with rachel gone,
does she make your job easier?

22:46.065 --> 22:47.348
Yes, and...

22:47.433 --> 22:49.466
Yes, but that does not
give her the right
to sue the company.

sue you for a wedding date.

Don't start with collier.

I should talk to him,

back on its feet?

my attention back

This is a copy
of the incident recall report

that the incident was
ongoing past midnight,

was legally an adult.

And stated that the suspects
had just fled in a vehicle
and provided the plate number.

This means that mr. Paolo
was 17 when the incident began

in the middle of it.

26:33.943 --> 26:35.726
the day before my client
turned 18.

29:37.159 --> 29:38.776
[mark] will you slow down?

29:40.579 --> 29:42.746
-Where are we?
-Old tunnels underneath
the courthouse.

29:42.848 --> 29:45.082
Doesn't matter.
Give me the goods on marshall.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.367
For starters, he makes
laski look like rbg.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.353
He is cut and dry
when it comes to law.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.755
He never wavers, ever.

29:51.841 --> 29:52.956
Why are you
so interested in marshall?

29:53.058 --> 29:55.676
Because I am pretty sure
he is going to become my boss.

29:55.761 --> 29:57.027
-Where's benner going?
-Court of appeal.

29:58.681 --> 30:00.564
-So, how's your thing going?
-It's not.

30:00.683 --> 30:04.685
Got maggie palmer
and berger smiling
at me with daggers for teeth.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.937
I want choi's job
in a bad way.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.522
-Any ideas?
-Yeah, you take it.

30:08.607 --> 30:09.773
No!

30:09.859 --> 30:12.893
No, no, no, I am a lone wolf.
I'm not a manager of folk.

30:12.995 --> 30:14.111
Mark, come on,
let's be honest,

30:14.196 --> 30:18.031
you are more
of a domesticated cat
than a lone wolf.

30:18.117 --> 30:19.900
Now how the hell
do we get out of here?

30:20.002 --> 30:21.001
[mimics hissing]

30:48.147 --> 30:49.029
[gasps]

30:49.815 --> 30:51.415
oh, my god.

30:56.755 --> 30:58.021
[carol] I can't...
I just can't
believe you're here.

30:58.140 --> 31:01.024
I hope the puerto rico
was all that you dreamed
and more.

31:01.126 --> 31:02.960
Honestly, I really don't care.

31:03.062 --> 31:05.028
Don't get me wrong,
luke, andy, the others,

31:05.147 --> 31:07.698
they have really
been pulling their weight.

31:07.816 --> 31:09.650
Especially luke,
he really surprised me.

31:09.735 --> 31:10.784
-Carol?
-[carol] yeah.

31:10.870 --> 31:13.203
Luke missed you,
of course, he'd never
admit it.

31:13.322 --> 31:15.405
Basically threw
himself into work.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.524
That's what I love
about you, lopez,
your doggedness,

31:17.626 --> 31:19.209
-in and out
of the courtroom.
-Carol, I--

31:19.328 --> 31:21.578
-look, you're barely back
and here you are, ready--
-to leave.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.512
What?

31:23.015 --> 31:23.830
I'm leaving.

31:24.300 --> 31:25.365
To go where?

31:25.467 --> 31:28.168
To... Look, don't...

31:30.789 --> 31:33.340
To practice holistic law.

31:33.425 --> 31:38.729
Really helping clients,
beyond just their
immediate legal needs,

31:38.847 --> 31:41.398
helping them find creative,
constructive solutions

31:41.517 --> 31:42.900
to whatever isn't
working in their lives

31:43.018 --> 31:45.602
and then helping them
navigate through all of that.

31:45.688 --> 31:47.220
-And you can do that here.
-I can't.

31:47.323 --> 31:53.327
Not with 50 to 100 clients
to help at any given moment.
I can't.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.380
-Where will you go?
-[emily] I have no idea.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.148
Which makes me really excited.

31:59.535 --> 32:01.401
And scared, at the same time.

32:01.704 --> 32:03.236
Both.

32:03.339 --> 32:04.738
But if the last 6 months
have taught me anything,

32:04.840 --> 32:08.375
it's that whatever happens,
I will be okay.

32:12.548 --> 32:13.513
[sighs]

32:16.185 --> 32:17.634
you always have a job here.

32:18.804 --> 32:20.137
You're a tremendous boss.

32:26.312 --> 32:27.894
-Really?
-Yeah.

32:29.064 --> 32:29.896
How soon do you
have to leave.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.648
Uh, effective immediately.

32:34.737 --> 32:38.088
But, um, there's someone
I have to see first.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.073
-[whispers] someone.
-[carol] yeah.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.498
[clears throat]

32:50.502 --> 32:52.002
-where's ms. Palmer?
-I needed to talk
to you first.

32:52.087 --> 32:55.339
Mr. Watkins, come back
when you have
ms. Palmer.

32:55.424 --> 32:57.641
This kid is not
a hardened criminal,
he made a mistake.

32:57.760 --> 32:59.593
One plus one equals three
is a mistake,

32:59.678 --> 33:04.297
intentionally robbing a store,
resulting in a man's death,
is a felony.

33:04.400 --> 33:05.482
Goodbye, mr. Watkins.

33:05.601 --> 33:07.651
-I need you.
-Do not start a sentence
with "can I".

33:07.770 --> 33:09.135
I do what the law
tells me to do.

33:09.238 --> 33:10.637
Sometimes you try--

33:10.739 --> 33:11.772
I try to sometimes do
what others don't.

33:11.857 --> 33:15.025
I try to give everyone
a fair crack at the law

33:15.110 --> 33:17.828
and I try to judge
without prejudice or bias,

33:17.946 --> 33:21.865
which is why I can't have
<i> ex parte</i> communications
with lawyers.

33:23.085 --> 33:25.619
-Now go, mr. Watkins.
-Yes, your honor.

33:29.258 --> 33:30.540
[sighs in exasperation]

33:30.626 --> 33:33.677
the law draws
a bright line.

33:33.796 --> 33:36.963
It states that a person's
birth date is deemed
to be midnight

33:37.049 --> 33:39.165
on the date of their birth.

33:39.268 --> 33:42.469
However, the facts
of this case blur that line.

33:42.554 --> 33:46.840
Upon review
of the surveillance video,
introduced by the people,

33:46.942 --> 33:53.513
the shove that resulted
in the death of the decedent
occurred at 11:58 p.M.,

33:53.615 --> 33:59.469
which is before mr. Paolo
was legally an adult.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.989
Under these circumstances,
I believe that the gravamen

34:03.075 --> 34:07.878
of the alleged offence
occurred while mr. Paolo
was still a minor.

34:07.996 --> 34:09.529
Therefore, I believe
fundamental fairness

34:09.631 --> 34:14.918
requires that this case be
certified to juvenile court.

34:15.003 --> 34:18.555
Ms. Palmer, if the people
wish to try mr. Paolo
as an adult,

34:18.674 --> 34:22.092
they are free to file
a transfer motion
in juvenile court.

34:22.177 --> 34:25.545
Your honor, I'd like
to state, for the record,

34:25.647 --> 34:27.514
that I will definitely
be pushing my office

34:27.599 --> 34:29.716
to file a transfer motion
in this case.

34:29.818 --> 34:32.402
-What does that mean?
-It means, mr. Paolo,

34:32.521 --> 34:36.773
that if it were solely
up to me to decide
whether to transfer you

34:36.859 --> 34:42.946
to adult court
to face 25 years to life,
or be released at 25,

34:44.032 --> 34:46.232
frankly, I don't know
what I would do.

34:46.335 --> 34:49.169
Contrary to what some people
in this room may believe,

34:52.324 --> 34:57.544
powerful consequences
for such a dire decision,
learn from it.

35:02.384 --> 35:04.050
[sobbing] I'm so sorry.

35:04.136 --> 35:05.719
-[mrs. Shelton whispers]
it's okay.
-[miles sobbing] I'm sorry.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.955
-What's this?
-An order of summary
judgment.

35:42.057 --> 35:44.424
-Dismissing your lawsuit.
-[scoffs] what?

35:44.510 --> 35:46.309
You failed to exhaust
admin remedies

35:46.428 --> 35:48.678
-before the california
labor commission.
-[jillian] okay.

35:48.764 --> 35:49.930
Well, then I'll just--

35:50.015 --> 35:52.465
claims typically go first
through the labor commission.

35:52.568 --> 35:54.151
-How long does that take?
-[amy] over 6 months.

35:54.269 --> 35:56.820
The alternative would be
for you to just be

35:56.939 --> 35:59.138
a salary professional
at the firm.

35:59.241 --> 36:00.640
We would hire you
as a paralegal,

36:00.742 --> 36:02.192
while you await
your bar results.

36:04.196 --> 36:05.912
Well, let me know
what you decide.

36:15.591 --> 36:17.624
-[lola] come on, come on.
-[exclaims]

36:17.709 --> 36:19.142
-[man] oh, there she is.
-[lisa] oh!

36:19.244 --> 36:20.159
[crowd applauding]

36:20.262 --> 36:24.998
you did not have
to do all of this.

36:25.100 --> 36:26.132
Yes, I did.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.551
[chanting] speech.

36:27.636 --> 36:30.003
Oh, no, no, I'm not
gonna give a speech,

36:30.105 --> 36:32.171
because this is far
from goodbye.

36:32.274 --> 36:34.057
In fact, I'm gonna be
right across the street.

36:34.142 --> 36:37.978
Then I would like
to say a few words.

36:40.482 --> 36:44.534
Judge lisa benner
is a trailblazer.

36:44.653 --> 36:49.372
When I first started this job,
she mentored and supported me,

36:49.491 --> 36:53.043
but she also kept
my feet to the fire,

36:53.161 --> 36:57.196
never letting up,
allowing me to be
the kind of judge

36:57.299 --> 37:00.083
I wanted to be,
even if she disagreed

37:00.168 --> 37:03.136
with some of my more
creative methods.

37:04.172 --> 37:09.042
And for that,
she has my utmost respect.

37:09.144 --> 37:15.565
She constantly reminds me
why I became a judge
and why I belong here.

37:15.684 --> 37:22.055
And this election has proven
that I still have some work
to do, even today.

37:22.157 --> 37:27.244
I was reminded of my resolve
going forward, being staunch

37:27.362 --> 37:30.030
in my pursuit of justice
and fairness.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.916
And that will never waiver,

37:33.035 --> 37:37.037
because you have shown me
that it doesn't have to.

37:37.122 --> 37:42.342
So, thank you,
lisa benner.

37:45.180 --> 37:50.183
Besides being a mentor
and a supporter,

37:52.304 --> 37:56.523
I am grateful
to also call you my friend.

37:59.695 --> 38:00.727
[crowd cheering and clapping]

38:06.902 --> 38:08.201
oh, take some pictures
of my cake.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.623
-Oh.
-Nice speech.

38:13.742 --> 38:17.077
The campaign training
has come in handy,
but watch your back.

38:17.829 --> 38:19.245
Lots of eyes on you now.

38:24.086 --> 38:25.585
-Edible balls?
-No, thank you.

38:35.564 --> 38:36.596
[luke laughs]

38:47.776 --> 38:50.476
-so, I didn't reach out
to you before now...
-There's no need to explain.

38:50.579 --> 38:53.279
...Because there's something
that I wanted to tell you
in person.

38:56.451 --> 38:58.535
I'm leaving the pd's office.

38:58.620 --> 39:01.788
And I am going
into holistic law.

39:01.873 --> 39:04.490
I had the feeling
you were up to something,
I just didn't know what.

39:04.593 --> 39:08.628
I'll still be trying cases
in the hoj, so I'll probably

39:08.714 --> 39:10.463
-be seeing a lot more
of you now.
-Here?

39:12.551 --> 39:14.500
-Or, um...
-I'm gonna be staying
with my brother,

39:14.603 --> 39:15.969
so there's that.

39:16.054 --> 39:16.936
We're just glad you're back.

39:18.557 --> 39:19.472
Puerto rico was good?

39:20.392 --> 39:21.307
Life changing.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.026
-And joaquin?
-He's good.

39:23.145 --> 39:24.811
But he's not here.

39:26.732 --> 39:27.564
Hey, watkins.

39:29.985 --> 39:31.184
-I bet you're emily.
-[emily] yes.

39:31.286 --> 39:34.654
I am emily
and you must be...

39:39.127 --> 39:41.745
Oh, that's amazing.

39:41.830 --> 39:44.297
-Uh, it's nice to meet you,
dahlia burke.
-Just burke.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.417
-Still wanna grab dinner?
-Absolutely.

39:48.804 --> 39:49.886
Talk later?

39:50.005 --> 39:51.671
Uh-huh, yeah, of course, yeah.

39:52.507 --> 39:53.506
-Bye.
-[burke] bye.

39:57.813 --> 39:58.978

Finally come to concede?

40:21.002 --> 40:22.619
I came to congratulate.

40:22.704 --> 40:25.221
-Next time, use the phone.
-I prefer a personal touch.

40:25.340 --> 40:28.074
I want you to know
this little war of ours
is far from over.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.910
I didn't realize
we were in a war.

How nice of me to warn you.

I want you to see me coming,
