Hey baby, come here, how are you?

07:21.061 --> 07:23.968
It's good to see you.
Nicole, this is Tiki Pot.

07:24.148 --> 07:26.836
Tiki is my partner in this new series,
he knows a lot of porn.

07:26.874 --> 07:28.112
Kip, I need two grams.

07:28.147 --> 07:30.806
We are putting the narrative
back in the porn, baby, and...

07:32.060 --> 07:33.263
Desdemona.

07:33.264 --> 07:36.371
You could totally play Desdemona.
Look at you. You're perfect.

07:46.298 --> 07:48.841
the Moor comes in, finds you
in bed upon his nurses...

07:48.941 --> 07:50.887
And he fucks me in the ass, huh?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.936
College student. Very clean. Brett?

07:52.940 --> 07:55.288
Wait, we're puttin' a whole new spin on
"The beast with two backs", baby.

07:55.321 --> 07:56.461
In fact, that's what it's called,

07:56.492 --> 07:57.868
"The beast with two backs"...
– Is that why you told me

07:57.878 --> 08:00.485
you had somebody handling it.
– .. or "Hole-thello", or "Butt-hole thello".

08:00.516 --> 08:02.716
Show her the pipe, huh?

08:04.912 --> 08:06.710
Tiki, that's your name?

08:07.968 --> 08:11.161
Why n'you shove that in your ass

Okay, I am sorry.

stills for me or something.

08:22.327 --> 08:25.098
What's going on with you?
I thought you were clean?

08:25.141 --> 08:28.723
And now you're... you're
like freakin' out on me.

08:29.394 --> 08:30.767
Com'on.

08:30.983 --> 08:32.441
Don't cry.

08:32.692 --> 08:33.812

08:39.581 --> 08:42.831
No, keep it, keep it.
I don't want it, okay?

08:43.179 --> 08:44.948
Listen.

08:45.197 --> 08:46.903
This is the 'Taliban'. Okay?

08:47.415 --> 08:50.028
Very heavy. Okay?
– I can handle it.

08:50.401 --> 08:53.203
I don't want you shooting this shit,
it's too heavy, alright?

08:53.255 --> 08:55.652
I won't. I promise.

08:57.456 --> 09:00.977
I'm just gonna smoke it out.
I haven't... used needles in weeks.

09:00.992 --> 09:05.285
Okay. No needles.
And if you get a little too low...

09:05.320 --> 09:07.716

get yourself back up.

09:07.835 --> 09:11.075
Alright, where you would need to be.
Alright?

I crashed and went straight to bed.

09:32.809 --> 09:34.617
All right, here we go.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.676
It's like a video game, right?

09:48.893 --> 09:54.723
Nothin' like a little... 30 knot cross
wind to exercise the ol' sphincter muscle.

09:54.758 --> 09:56.451

current on her rent.

14:59.272 --> 15:02.160
I want to apologize for
the bumps this morning,

15:02.161 --> 15:04.860
uh, evidently Florida
doesn't like us Georgians.

15:04.998 --> 15:09.682
Maybe it has to do with the beatin'
the Bulldogs put on the Gators last fall.

15:10.757 --> 15:13.738
Then I suggest to stretch out and relax,

15:13.739 --> 15:16.721
air might be a little cranky, so we're
gonna ask that you to remain in your seat

15:16.750 --> 15:19.271
with you seat belt securely
fasten around you.

15:19.777 --> 15:21.782
We won’t have beverage service
today but the flight attendants

15:21.783 --> 15:24.751
will be going through the cabin
with water and with snacks,

15:24.808 --> 15:27.997
havin' you on the ground in Atlanta,
in 40 minutes. Thank you.

16:58.372 --> 17:00.297
Hey Nicole, open up.

17:00.641 --> 17:04.529
Fuck, Nicole. I know you're in there,
I can smell that shit cooking.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.053
Better not you burnin'
down my fuckin' building!

17:12.834 --> 17:14.862
How can anybody sleep like that?

17:16.881 --> 17:17.726
I don't know.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.401
And how long has
Sleeping Beauty been out?

17:20.415 --> 17:22.359
26 Minutes.

17:23.250 --> 17:25.865
We're gonna start descending
any second now.

17:25.866 --> 17:27.354
Well, looks like you will
need to wake him up.

17:43.221 --> 17:45.510
– What is that?
– The elevator feels really stiff, sir.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.362
Right, don't force.

17:48.336 --> 17:52.130
Hi, Margaret, get everybody strapped in,
get everybody strapped in tight.

17:53.714 --> 17:54.661

18:12.778 --> 18:15.299
<i>Fasten your seat belts, now!</i>

18:15.675 --> 18:18.276
I have no control on my side.
No control at all, sir.

18:18.291 --> 18:20.984
Lost hydraulics. Center,
this is SouthJet 2-2-7,

18:21.040 --> 18:24.423
we've lost our hydraulics and,
feels like our pitch control?

<i>SouthJet 2-2-7, Atlanta Center,</i>

18:26.073 --> 18:27.561
– <i>I understand you've lost hydraulics...</i>
– Turn on the back-up pumps, back-up pumps.

18:27.562 --> 18:28.683
– <i>.. and pitch control.</i>
– That is affirmed,

18:28.690 --> 18:31.163
we are in a uncontrolled des-

18:38.060 --> 18:40.276
Get belted in, with everybody
in brace position.

18:40.292 --> 18:43.884
Yes, that is affirmed. We are in a dive.
We are in a dive!

18:43.907 --> 18:46.138
We have lost vertical control.

18:46.157 --> 18:48.865
We're gonna need drag. I want you
to throw out everything you got,

18:48.867 --> 18:50.601
the speed brakes, the gear, everything.

18:50.628 --> 18:52.905
Here! Speed brakes!

18:56.623 --> 19:01.488
Brace for descent. Head down, head
forward. Head down, head forward!

19:01.572 --> 19:04.008
Uh, gear's down, I think
hydraulics is the problem, sir.

19:04.034 --> 19:05.879
We need to dump the fuel.

19:05.880 --> 19:06.947
Do it!

19:07.525 --> 19:08.925
Ah, alright!

19:11.746 --> 19:15.376
Atlanta Center, this is SouthJet 2-2-7.
We're in an uncontrolled dive.

19:15.396 --> 19:18.877
Descending out of 21,000 feet,
we're declaring an emergency,

19:19.112 --> 19:22.250
we dumped our fuel,
we got a jammed stabilizer or something.

19:22.271 --> 19:24.348
We need a block of altitude
to work the problem,

19:24.349 --> 19:25.958
and a heading to the nearest airport.

19:26.289 --> 19:27.661

Uh, yeah.

the flaps, retract the gears,

21:17.954 --> 21:21.209
trim us nose down, okay, whatever
you think, it's gonna be opposite,

21:21.233 --> 21:23.215

21:24.520 --> 21:27.129
Margaret. When I tell you,
I want you to push this forward.

21:27.152 --> 21:28.784

21:28.800 --> 21:30.103
– Yeah. Okay.

21:30.116 --> 21:32.103
Wait, wait sir. What do we do,
and why would I trim down?

21:32.113 --> 21:34.649
– We're gonna roll it. Okay?
– What do you mean, rolling?

21:34.665 --> 21:36.282

Charlie Anderson?

27:40.821 --> 27:42.600
How you feelin', Whip?

27:45.011 --> 27:48.606
Initial reports look like you pulled
some kind of move up there, man.

27:48.984 --> 27:50.722
You saved a lot of lives.

27:51.841 --> 27:53.241
How many?

27:54.042 --> 27:55.907
On the 102 souls on board,

27:55.914 --> 27:58.903
including the flight crew,
96 of them survived the crash.

28:01.451 --> 28:05.608
Six people died.
Two crew, four passengers.

28:07.578 --> 28:09.808
Who... who on the crew?

28:14.797 --> 28:16.927
– Listen. The protocol is-
– Who in the crew, Charlie?

28:17.363 --> 28:19.529
The protocol is that the NTSB has to be

28:19.530 --> 28:21.646
the first to make contact
with you, I can't...

28:22.413 --> 28:24.879
And their agent's here, so...

28:25.741 --> 28:28.094
Let me go get him, it's a bit of a show.

28:28.363 --> 28:32.069
So there's... half
a dozen of them. Alright.

28:35.309 --> 28:38.119
Hey Craig. Morning.

28:50.861 --> 28:53.590
Captain William Whitaker?

28:54.086 --> 28:56.759
Nod if you can hear me and understand me.

28:57.279 --> 29:00.097
I'm Craig Matson of the NT... NTSB,

29:00.146 --> 29:02.589
and I am required as
the lead on the Go Team

29:02.597 --> 29:04.266
to make initial contact with you,

29:04.287 --> 29:07.391
after a major incident
like the one you had today.

29:08.657 --> 29:11.555
You are in a hospital,
in South Atlanta.

29:13.600 --> 29:17.274
Are you aware that the plane
you were piloting went down?

29:20.103 --> 29:23.101
I have a doctor here who can
explain the medical situation.

29:24.232 --> 29:28.144
I'm Dr. Kenan. And the good news is,
you're in good condition.

29:28.555 --> 29:30.264
You did suffer concussion,

29:30.351 --> 29:32.905
you have numerous lacerations
around your left eye,

29:32.979 --> 29:36.083
we're going to keep the patch on just
for a few days, just as a precaution.

29:36.109 --> 29:38.453
Your eye seems to be okay.

29:38.537 --> 29:40.878
Now the MRI’s show that you
have some strained tendons

29:40.894 --> 29:45.211
in your left knee and ankle,
and you have no broken bones,

29:45.301 --> 29:48.029
but you have some deep bruising
in your left thigh, and some

29:48.045 --> 29:51.375
torn ligaments in your
left wrist. Nothing serious.

29:51.550 --> 29:53.650
So, as soon as we clear your concussion,

29:53.651 --> 29:55.961
and you feel well enough,
you can go home.

29:56.024 --> 30:00.196
That may take a day, maybe three.
Okay?

30:04.157 --> 30:08.195
I won’t ask too much of you
tonight, but as I said,

30:08.366 --> 30:12.154
the NTSB is required
to make initial contact.

30:13.589 --> 30:17.019
How much do you remember about the flight?

30:19.017 --> 30:21.102
Uh, I remember...

30:23.970 --> 30:26.250
I remember everything up to the crash.

30:26.417 --> 30:29.758
Okay... Mr. Whitaker, that’s fine.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.965
I am required to inform you that this
incident did result in the loss of life.

30:36.846 --> 30:42.031
The current information states that
of the 102 souls on board, we lost 6.

30:42.438 --> 30:44.686
Two crew members, and four passengers.

30:45.231 --> 30:47.347
59 people were treated and released.

30:47.541 --> 30:48.719
37 people remain-

30:48.720 --> 30:50.452
– Who died on the crew?

30:50.777 --> 30:56.406
The two flight attendants...
Camelia Satou and Katerina Marquez.

30:58.762 --> 31:02.986
The rep from your Pilot’s Union,
Mr. Anderson, will be our contact for you,

31:03.002 --> 31:07.757
it’s important that you follow your
Union’s guidance on press and media.

31:08.381 --> 31:11.542
The pilot’s union works
closely with the NTSB.

31:11.844 --> 31:16.811
So... I’m gonna head out.
Good luck, Mr. Whitaker.

31:29.752 --> 31:32.789
I knew Trina Marquez, she was...

31:33.992 --> 31:35.851
We spent some time together.

31:36.102 --> 31:38.619
Yeah, apparently she was not strapped in.

31:39.778 --> 31:42.734
Survivor reported
she was assisting a kid.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.595
And Margaret Thomason, how's she doing?

31:45.840 --> 31:50.140
Broken collarbone. Just, um, cuts,
I mean she's banged up, but she’s...

31:50.204 --> 31:52.304
she's here too, she's fine.

31:52.930 --> 31:55.841
And Ken Evans, your copilot, he-he...

31:55.992 --> 31:58.227
he took a bad shot to the head.

31:58.562 --> 32:02.096
And now they’re keepin’ him in a coma
just to let the brain swelling go down,

32:02.114 --> 32:05.271
but we feel good about him.
He’s gonna be okay.

32:08.555 --> 32:10.984
What are you doing here, Charlie?

32:12.212 --> 32:13.825
I’m flying a desk now.

32:14.373 --> 32:16.366
I’m a rep for the pilot's Union.

32:16.783 --> 32:18.361
You’re the rep for the pilots’?

32:18.418 --> 32:21.720
Yeah, I'm the one, and when your plane
went down, all the reps got a page

32:21.730 --> 32:25.430
and I just shot up my hand cause
I know you and said I wanted to

32:25.443 --> 32:28.110
come and be the first face you’d see.

32:28.681 --> 32:30.358
I'm glad you're here.

32:30.636 --> 32:33.266
The Union's gonna release
a statement on your behalf.

32:33.626 --> 32:36.174
Condolences to the families
who lost their loved ones,

32:36.225 --> 32:39.005
gratitude to the brave men
and women of the flight crew.

32:39.556 --> 32:41.747
That's-you don't have to worry about that.

32:42.806 --> 32:45.311
And I know you and Deana have
been divorced for a while now,

32:45.320 --> 32:46.948
but maybe she and your son Will gonna-

32:47.071 --> 32:48.824
Yes, Knuckles...

32:51.122 --> 32:52.854
How old is he now?

32:52.855 --> 32:54.585
Too old. Fifteen.

32:55.061 --> 32:57.190
– Fiteen? Wow.
– Yeah.

32:58.081 --> 33:00.502
When we flew out for Delta,
you were not even married.

33:01.135 --> 33:03.758
We're dinosaurs, Whip.

33:06.443 --> 33:08.901
Do you want me to reach out to Deana?

33:09.217 --> 33:11.887
And see if... she and Will
want to come down or...?

33:11.910 --> 33:13.365
No, I don't want.

33:13.967 --> 33:15.336
I’ll call her.

33:15.799 --> 33:17.730
Well, speaking of which, I got your phone.

33:17.748 --> 33:21.363
And the whole bunch of your
personnal effect from the plane.

33:21.402 --> 33:23.222
Your clothes are toast.

33:25.124 --> 33:27.014
Uh, do you...

33:27.361 --> 33:30.804
Do you need me to...
to get you some stuff?

33:30.898 --> 33:32.895
Nah, 'bout okay.

33:33.256 --> 33:35.662
Charlie, I'm uh...

33:37.546 --> 33:39.831
Damn, I'm glad you came.

33:40.275 --> 33:42.235
Okay, too.
I'm happy to be here.

33:44.113 --> 33:48.314
Well, I'm...
I'll let you get some rest and...

33:48.413 --> 33:50.363
but I'll come back, I mean,
you will see plenty of me.

33:50.371 --> 33:51.800
Sure you will.

33:53.923 --> 33:55.991
The plane was fucked, Charlie.

33:56.014 --> 33:57.514
It was doomed.

33:58.169 --> 33:59.890
I know.

34:00.773 --> 34:04.123
The way you landed that plane
was nothing short of a miracle.

34:04.498 --> 34:05.898
You know that.

34:08.712 --> 34:10.411
Alright, Captain.

34:10.600 --> 34:12.722
– Good night.
– Good night.

35:03.556 --> 35:06.373
I'm on the list, baby girl.
Mr. Mays...

35:07.188 --> 35:09.191
Harling.

35:13.432 --> 35:15.967
If this is gonna turn into a sponge bath,
I’ll come back later.

35:15.992 --> 35:17.112
Sir...

35:17.513 --> 35:20.721
It's alright, honey. I'm on the list.
Harling Mays.

35:20.792 --> 35:22.892
Some say they Harling knew me.

35:23.139 --> 35:26.971
Honey, could you hustle us a couple
of daiquiris, and a cocktail weenie?

35:27.035 --> 35:29.548
On second thought just bring the
booze, I brought my own weenie.

35:29.610 --> 35:31.645
Ah, well she's offended
and she should be.

35:31.778 --> 35:33.878
I’m a pig.
And I hate me.

35:33.932 --> 35:37.914
That’s what we have in common
Nurse Ratched. We both hate me.

35:39.654 --> 35:40.745
Harling Mays.

35:41.089 --> 35:45.175
Whip, what the fuck my man?

35:45.867 --> 35:49.827
They’re sayin’, “Sweet Jesus,
what a stud that pilot is.”

35:49.862 --> 35:50.976
You’re a hero, man.

35:51.179 --> 35:54.497
You will never pay for
another drink as long as you live.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.766
There is all kind o' those
crazy news people out here,

35:56.767 --> 35:58.529
it's a fucking circus, man.

35:58.544 --> 36:01.036
Come on, check this shit out,
man, it's all for you.

36:01.774 --> 36:03.529
Look at this shit.

36:03.795 --> 36:05.817
Classic hero worship shit.

36:05.880 --> 36:10.106
You're a rock star, man.
Oh, check out this video.

36:10.158 --> 36:12.336
This's outside your condo.
It's a zoo.

36:12.386 --> 36:14.224
It crowded with reporters.

36:14.255 --> 36:15.268
Let's see, check this out.

36:15.278 --> 36:16.629
Let's see, check this out.
<i>So you do know Captain Whitaker,</i>

36:16.636 --> 36:17.231
– <i>you were friends?</i>
– Com'on.

36:17.247 --> 36:18.016
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

36:18.017 --> 36:19.147
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>

36:19.163 --> 36:20.283
<i>Yes, he's my brother.</i>
– That's me.

36:20.292 --> 36:23.196
And that‘s Mark Mellon, you know
that douchey talking haircut from

36:23.201 --> 36:25.597
local Atlanta channel 12?
I said a few words,

36:25.605 --> 36:27.370
you know most of ‘em straight talk.

36:27.949 --> 36:29.069
Oh!

36:29.489 --> 36:30.676
You okay, Captain Whitaker?

36:30.684 --> 36:33.098
The meds they’re giving me,
they're messing me up, I’m all...

36:33.127 --> 36:35.575
shaky and dried out, I can’t sleep good.

36:35.591 --> 36:37.745
Yeah. What the hell kind
of meds they give you?

36:38.280 --> 36:39.807
Alprazolam.

36:40.440 --> 36:44.133
That's generic Xanax. Hydroconon,
that's generic Vicodin. It's shit.

36:44.154 --> 36:46.940
Prolly Canadian.
We don't want this shit.

36:47.340 --> 36:50.661
We want the premium stuff, blue label.
Not this fucking well shit.

36:50.690 --> 36:53.023
I mean, where's the...
where’s the dihydromorphinone?

36:53.026 --> 36:55.179
Or at least some fucking
Palladone, for Christ sake,

36:55.196 --> 36:58.045
is this amateur architect doctor in here
you just saved some 100 people-

36:58.084 --> 37:00.149
Harling!

37:00.269 --> 37:01.626
You bring my smokes?

37:01.722 --> 37:05.160
Yes I did, I got your fucking message,
and yes I got your fucking smokes.

37:05.383 --> 37:08.059
Right here...
Here's a fresh carton.

37:08.359 --> 37:10.136
You smoke your nuts off, champion.

37:10.154 --> 37:12.769
Hell if I was you, I'd fire up right
here in the goddamn room.

37:12.808 --> 37:15.923
Here. I got you a pint of vodka,
I got you some Red Bull,

37:15.932 --> 37:17.668
you know what I'm saying,
I know my customer.

37:17.699 --> 37:18.850
Take the vodka with you.

37:18.851 --> 37:20.598
What? Take the vodka,
what d'you-

37:20.603 --> 37:22.262
I'm not drinking anymore,
take it with you.

37:22.294 --> 37:23.369
Are you ins... I'll just tuck-

37:23.387 --> 37:24.401
– Take the fucking vodka with you.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.282
– Take the fucking vodka with you.
– Okay.

37:25.682 --> 37:28.125
Listen mate, you got to
come to get me tomorrow.

37:28.260 --> 37:29.380
Okay?

37:32.133 --> 37:34.686
I want you to go by my condo...

37:35.187 --> 37:38.989
pick me up some clothes,
and uh, my phone charger.

37:39.153 --> 37:43.119
Look in my refrigerator, and pick up
a package that says "veal" on it.

37:43.245 --> 37:44.494
– It's marked. Veal.

37:44.495 --> 37:45.117
– It's marked. Veal.
– Veal.

37:45.118 --> 37:46.565
In the freezer's, marked veal.

37:46.596 --> 37:48.382
Done and done.
What time you want me here?

37:48.399 --> 37:50.101
– I call you.
– Okay. You give me mayday,

37:50.113 --> 37:52.170
and you’re outta here in 7 minutes.
Oh!

37:52.473 --> 37:55.119
Oh, almost forgot,
I got you some stroke mags,

37:55.181 --> 37:57.234
I've been in a hospital before,
I know what you need,

37:57.284 --> 37:59.984
I got Juggs, Hot MILFS in heat,
Assmasters,

38:00.055 --> 38:02.155
you just stroke it all day,
you're a hero.

38:02.321 --> 38:06.363
If I was here, I'd just lay here
pullin'on that thing all day long,

38:06.364 --> 38:10.184
you know what I'm saying,
there's a smile... yessir.

39:11.698 --> 39:14.332
Devious minds think alike.

39:15.904 --> 39:17.682
Don't go.

39:19.099 --> 39:21.189
I'll be quiet, it is...

39:21.934 --> 39:26.402
nice to... just sit and
smoke with somebody.

39:32.604 --> 39:34.499
Were you on that plane?

39:35.476 --> 39:36.715
Yeah, why?

39:37.140 --> 39:38.305
You?

39:39.538 --> 39:41.803
You must have been sittin' at the back.

39:44.713 --> 39:46.959
Yeah... by the back.

39:47.430 --> 39:49.530
<i>Tobacco's but an Indian weed,</i>

39:49.772 --> 39:51.920
<i>Grows green in the morn, cut down at eve</i>

39:51.943 --> 39:54.768
<i>It shows our decay, we are but clay.</i>

39:55.590 --> 39:59.095
Ah, I love the smell
of nicotine in the mornin'!

40:00.562 --> 40:02.153
It smells like victory!

40:03.138 --> 40:04.958
Can't buy more.

40:08.619 --> 40:10.463
I should quit.

40:11.067 --> 40:13.967
My cancer might get cancer.

40:17.818 --> 40:19.497
In the plane crash?

40:19.498 --> 40:20.822
You are...

40:22.799 --> 40:25.859
Holy shit, man!
You're the fucking pilot!

40:26.892 --> 40:29.413
Huh, what happened out there?

40:30.287 --> 40:32.296
Okay.
Yeah, I-hmm...

40:32.525 --> 40:34.514
Tough deal, man, but you, uh...

40:34.855 --> 40:37.428
You walked away.
You limped away.

40:37.884 --> 40:41.264
Yeah, I'm lucky.
Goin’ home tomorrow.

40:41.398 --> 40:42.518
Home...

40:42.783 --> 40:44.398
Home for me is the basement...

40:44.580 --> 40:46.632
They keep cancer treatment
in the basement.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.828
What kind of cancer you have?

40:49.014 --> 40:52.207
Fibro-mixzoid sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma.

40:52.263 --> 40:54.597
Very rare. God chose me.

40:55.349 --> 40:57.389
You believe in Him?

40:57.923 --> 41:01.470
Fuck yeah bitch, you’re a stupid
fucker if you don’t believe in God.

41:01.790 --> 41:04.178
Once you realize all the
random events in your life are God,

41:04.196 --> 41:06.701
you will live a much easier life.

41:07.095 --> 41:10.428
You spend all your time trying to control
all these things that happen to us.

41:10.467 --> 41:11.389
Bullshit.

41:11.744 --> 41:14.500
The plane you’re flying goes down?
Out of your control.

41:14.535 --> 41:17.229
God gives you cancer.
I got no control over that.

41:17.611 --> 41:21.015
Did God give me cancer?
You bet your ass God gave me cancer.

41:21.103 --> 41:24.092
You know, you think God would have
given me cancer if I had asked for it?

41:24.139 --> 41:27.980
Well I don't think so, cause I begged him
to take it away, and guess what?

41:29.336 --> 41:31.921
No control over that either.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.592
What are you doing here, honey?

41:34.803 --> 41:36.753
You're beautiful, you know that?

41:37.976 --> 41:39.991
Do I scare you?

41:41.058 --> 41:44.931
People either are drawn to me,
or they pretend that they can’t see me.

41:46.669 --> 41:47.789
It’s a trip...

41:47.822 --> 41:49.736
They think that because I'm
getting close to the other side,

41:49.758 --> 41:51.740
I got some sort of power or wisdom.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.521
Like I got all the answers.

41:53.678 --> 41:55.583
I don't know, maybe I do.

41:56.592 --> 41:58.745
Death gives you perspective.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.409
It all makes sense somehow.

42:00.551 --> 42:03.283
And I just can’t get over
how beautiful you are!

42:04.791 --> 42:06.424
I can see your arm.

42:06.488 --> 42:08.120
You're an addict?

42:09.862 --> 42:10.595
Yeah.

42:11.586 --> 42:13.163
What's your name?

42:14.282 --> 42:15.790
Nicole.

42:16.655 --> 42:18.683
What d'you do in the world, Nicole?

42:19.004 --> 42:20.404
Not much.

42:21.260 --> 42:23.804
I was a photographer and
then I was a masseuse,

42:23.812 --> 42:27.169
and now I... I sometimes
wash hair at a salon.

42:27.224 --> 42:29.044
Oh yeah? Where is it?

42:29.461 --> 42:33.154
I will come by, I’m really easy,
you just wash my head.

42:35.237 --> 42:37.215
You think you’re gonna die?

42:48.835 --> 42:50.524
Don’t you just love her?

42:51.473 --> 42:52.708
I don't know her.

42:52.709 --> 42:55.322
Bullshit. I do.

42:56.444 --> 42:58.339
Random Act of God?

42:58.566 --> 43:00.386
I don’t think so.

43:00.744 --> 43:04.699
You survive a plane crash and meet
a beautiful woman in a stairwell...

43:05.676 --> 43:08.003
Fuck you, man.

43:10.726 --> 43:12.471
Probably looking for me.

43:13.309 --> 43:14.853
My family just flew in from Utah.

43:14.861 --> 43:17.112
You know it’s bad when
they start flying in.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.507
It is a trip.

43:21.870 --> 43:24.327
With every morning special now.

43:24.812 --> 43:26.872
I am greateful for that.

43:27.077 --> 43:29.567
I wish I could bottle
this feelin' that I have...

43:30.100 --> 43:33.047
about how beautiful
every last breath of life is.

43:37.386 --> 43:39.485
Yeah, I get one more just for the road?

43:39.635 --> 43:42.078
Here. Take the pack.

43:46.772 --> 43:48.014
Thank you.

43:48.121 --> 43:50.329
I’ll pass these out in the cancer ward.

43:51.432 --> 43:52.680
Nicole...

43:53.097 --> 43:54.313
you’re gonna be okay.

44:01.184 --> 44:03.193
Chemo brain...

44:04.350 --> 44:06.298
It makes you pretty foggy.

44:06.299 --> 44:07.272
Oh, yeah?

44:07.504 --> 44:09.244
They call it chemo brain.

44:09.799 --> 44:13.144
My mom, she used to slur
her words and get all chatty.

44:14.172 --> 44:15.924
Your mom had cancer?

44:16.819 --> 44:19.234
Breast cancer, she was only 54.

44:20.655 --> 44:22.857
Is that why you think you gonna die?

44:25.380 --> 44:28.753
Heroin addicts who're usin' needles,
they tend to die.

44:29.441 --> 44:33.302
Especially women for some reason,
I have read in a pamphlet.

44:34.761 --> 44:38.616
A woman from AA, she just came
to see me while I was in rea.

44:41.510 --> 44:43.351
That guy was a trip, uh?

44:43.619 --> 44:44.546
– Yeah.

44:44.995 --> 44:47.442
He made it feel like, I dunno...

44:48.269 --> 44:52.055
like you and me were
the last people left on this planet.

44:53.462 --> 44:57.217
And together we'll... save the world.

45:09.435 --> 45:11.349
Where d'you live, Nicole?

45:11.544 --> 45:14.629
Why, you wanna come to visit me?
It's luxurious.

45:15.412 --> 45:17.671
I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.

45:18.174 --> 45:19.499
I'll come to visit you.

45:19.711 --> 45:20.622
You're sweet.

45:20.785 --> 45:22.025
I will.

45:22.759 --> 45:24.306
What’s your address?

45:25.821 --> 45:29.198
I live at the Georgian Terraces...
on Taylor street.

45:29.225 --> 45:30.345
Okay.

45:31.022 --> 45:34.229
You say you're a masseuse.
What kind of masseuse?

45:34.962 --> 45:37.974
I've been every kind of masseuse there is.

45:40.855 --> 45:42.509
Good luck, Nicole.

45:48.680 --> 45:52.306
I couldn't find any suitcases.
I put all your shit in garbage bags.

45:52.307 --> 45:53.551
No, thanks.

45:56.479 --> 45:59.222
You’re stayin’ with me
down on University, right?

45:59.334 --> 46:04.097
Hey it’s nice... A lotta young people...
Good vibe.

46:05.162 --> 46:07.745
No, I’m gonna go to the farm.

46:08.554 --> 46:10.458
The farm?

46:10.762 --> 46:13.080
I can’t stay at my condo.

46:13.602 --> 46:15.599
I thought you sold your Dad's place.

46:15.709 --> 46:17.103
Not yet.

46:19.127 --> 46:21.426
I’m not sure I wanna stay at the farm.

46:21.632 --> 46:25.199
You’re not. You're gonna drive me
to the airport so I can pick-up my car.

46:26.529 --> 46:27.578
Veal?

46:28.079 --> 46:29.199
Really?

47:44.484 --> 47:48.706
<i>Captain Whitaker, this is Jim Court,
I’m with CNN. We'd like to-</i>

47:48.946 --> 47:52.196
<i>This is NBC affiliate in Athens.
We're looking to-</i>

50:44.681 --> 50:47.781
<i>In the wake of the deadly
crash of SouthJet Flight 2-2-7,</i>

50:47.881 --> 50:51.536
<i>we have more questions than answers
as to what exactly happened that day,</i>

50:51.636 --> 50:53.899
<i>and like many, we are
around looking for answers.</i>

50:53.946 --> 50:57.297
<i>Looking here at the home of
pilot, captain Whip Whitaker.</i>

50:57.483 --> 51:00.420
<i>Still have no signs of him
coming to his condo....</i>

51:00.455 --> 51:03.840
<i>This is Bart Malles still on the hunt
and looking down for answers.</i>

51:03.875 --> 51:07.904
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting
Company, flying lessons and plane rides.</i>

51:07.948 --> 51:11.518
<i>Please leave a message and
it will be returned. Thank you.</i>

51:12.993 --> 51:16.050
<i>Hey, cowboy. Charlie again.</i>

51:16.167 --> 51:19.532
<i>Look, I'm back in town and... I
stopped by at the hospital tonight,</i>

51:19.542 --> 51:23.891
<i>but, uh... they said you'd gone home,
so you must be feeling pretty good.</i>

51:24.421 --> 51:27.926
Uh... Listen, I went, uh... at your condo

51:27.936 --> 51:30.325
and the manager said
you had not returned, so...

51:30.603 --> 51:32.808
you maybe with relatives,
which I understand,

51:32.843 --> 51:35.926
but I know you have a doctor's appointment
early in the morning for your eye,

51:35.946 --> 51:38.940
and I was just hoping that
you could meet us for breakfast,

51:39.366 --> 51:42.856
'bout ten o'clock at St Regis,
there is an executive buffet there,

51:43.036 --> 51:46.400
And we'll be covering some
pretty important stuff, so...

51:46.808 --> 51:48.688
it'd be nice to have you there.

51:48.915 --> 51:50.873
Alright. Be good.

52:16.901 --> 52:20.212
Oh, there he is. Hey Whip,
hey buddy. Man, you loog good!

52:20.232 --> 52:21.984
I feel-Thanks for coming,
I'm glad you got my message.

52:22.016 --> 52:23.685
How is your eye?
– Good. Goog, good.

52:23.742 --> 52:25.794
Here's Hugh Lang,
he's an attorney from Chicago.

52:25.817 --> 52:27.517
– Pleasure to meet you, Captain.
– My pleasure.

52:27.541 --> 52:29.808
– Sit down. You wanna coffee?
– Uh, yes I do.

52:29.843 --> 52:31.919
Could we have some fresh coffee?

52:32.218 --> 52:35.545
We were just talking about
your copilot’s wife.

52:35.950 --> 52:38.320
She told a newspaper
that “God landed that plane”.

52:38.555 --> 52:40.925
Yeah? God?

52:41.133 --> 52:42.576
Well, I too believe God landed the plane,

52:42.588 --> 52:45.708
same way I believe God should hit the
buffet, the turkey sausage is excellent.

52:46.037 --> 52:48.151
No, I’m fine with coffee, thank you.

52:48.445 --> 52:50.720
So Len Caldwell really wanted
to get here this morning,

52:50.727 --> 52:52.193
Len's the president of the pilots’ union,

52:52.194 --> 52:54.170
he wanted to be here to
meet with us, and you,

52:54.469 --> 52:56.585
but they needed him at the crash site.

52:56.746 --> 52:58.540
So as you know, when a plane goes down,

52:58.556 --> 53:01.900
the NTSB sends a “go team”
to the crash site immediately.

53:01.935 --> 53:03.612
They find the flight data recorders?

53:03.654 --> 53:07.269
– They did, it's perfectly intact.
– Oh, great, then that solves everything.

53:07.644 --> 53:10.901
So. Why do we need a lawyer from Chicago?

53:10.981 --> 53:14.619
Well... Hugh specializes
in criminal negligence.

53:14.666 --> 53:16.486
– Criminal negligence?
– Hmm-hmm.

53:16.864 --> 53:18.675
Death demands responsibility.

53:18.693 --> 53:21.057
Six dead on that plane,
someone has to pay.

53:21.076 --> 53:23.444
Yeah, but that's a plane
that fell apart at...

53:23.445 --> 53:25.308
think it fell apart at 30 thousand feet.

53:25.509 --> 53:27.899
And the airline will try to
prove equipment failure.

53:27.999 --> 53:30.910
Which is gonna make the manufacturer
responsible, the manufacturer in turn

53:30.926 --> 53:33.713
is gonna try and prove poor maintenance
of the equipment by the airline.

53:33.739 --> 53:35.041
Or pilot error.

53:37.174 --> 53:40.136
I flew the plane inverted,
that means upside down, Hugh.

53:40.171 --> 53:43.973
You get the picture? A hundred people
upside down, 500 feet off the ground.

53:44.020 --> 53:45.877
You have any idea what that's like?

53:45.981 --> 53:48.861
I do. I, uh... heard the
black box recordings last night.

53:48.888 --> 53:50.815
Oh you heard. So you're a pilot?

53:51.026 --> 53:51.956
No, no.

53:51.984 --> 53:53.526
Then you know what the fuck
you're talking about, do you?

53:53.549 --> 53:54.656
Hugh's on our team, Whip.

53:54.664 --> 53:55.593
– Is he?
– Yeah, he is,

53:55.600 --> 53:56.700
– He didn' act like he gonna
– obviously...

53:56.708 --> 53:58.021
– have to imagine me questions
– well, he is, yeah but...

53:58.026 --> 53:59.271
– like a fucking pilot,
– Listen to me,

53:59.285 --> 54:00.544
– and that he knows something.
– it's the NTSB's ball game.

54:00.780 --> 54:04.355
They run the investigation, and
they will ultimately rule on the cause.

54:04.479 --> 54:06.371
And that's why we need him.
– Well, they...

54:06.497 --> 54:09.018
interview the entire flight
crew, they...

54:09.700 --> 54:12.682
interview the passengers,
they... hold public hearings.

54:13.068 --> 54:15.995
Hey, let's cut to the chase, what...
just tell me what I need to know, Charlie.

54:15.998 --> 54:21.355
The NTSB 'go-team' also collects
blood, hair, and skin samples

54:21.360 --> 54:25.420
from the entire flight crew for the
purposes of a toxicological report.

54:25.529 --> 54:28.242
Okay... When do they want to do that?

54:28.438 --> 54:30.805
They've already done that.
In the hospital.

54:30.992 --> 54:33.097
That's the first thing they do.

54:34.058 --> 54:36.385
You don't remember having your
blood drawn the night of the crash?

54:36.573 --> 54:37.807
– No.
– No?

54:42.913 --> 54:45.371
They get the results of these...
these tests?

54:45.535 --> 54:46.952
Yeah, they do.

54:47.999 --> 54:49.426
Anything else for you, gentlemen?

54:49.481 --> 54:53.150
Yeah, uh... you have warm
cinnamon bums over there.

54:53.167 --> 54:55.400
Could you give me one of those, please.
In fact give me only two bums.

54:55.423 --> 54:56.821
– Yes sir, comin'up.
– Thank you, sweetie.

54:57.009 --> 54:58.129
Now...

54:58.485 --> 55:00.857
An initial report shows that...

55:00.895 --> 55:05.784
you had alcohol in your system...
uh, at a level of .2 4.

55:05.808 --> 55:07.954
Now...
in the good old U.S.,

55:07.969 --> 55:11.219
a very one of the most lenient
drunk driving countries in the world,

55:11.270 --> 55:14.908
you go to jail for driving
with anything above .0 8.

55:15.080 --> 55:17.816
And by driving, I mean a car.

55:18.525 --> 55:20.431
Thank you.
Well...

55:20.558 --> 55:22.977
so that was... don't mean anything,

55:22.986 --> 55:24.915
a couple of beers the
night before the flight,

55:24.937 --> 55:26.610
would that make the tail
of the plane explode?

55:26.626 --> 55:29.022
– Couple of beers?
– Yeah, couple of beers.

55:29.255 --> 55:30.781
You know, I need a lawyer, Charlie.

55:30.782 --> 55:32.422
– Hugh is your lawyer.
– I need a bigger lawyer.

55:32.423 --> 55:35.118
I need a layer that understands that
someone put me on a broken plane,

55:35.136 --> 55:38.079
without me up there, there
would be a 102 funerals, not six.

55:38.105 --> 55:39.884
We're not talking about
funeral right now, Captain.

55:40.007 --> 55:40.421
– Well then, what are we talking about?

55:40.422 --> 55:42.076
– Well then, what are we talking about?
– We're talking about prison time.

55:42.937 --> 55:44.161
– What?
– Lawsuits.

55:45.258 --> 55:45.778
Somebody has to pay.

55:45.779 --> 55:47.151
Somebody has to pay.
– What, I write a check?

55:47.186 --> 55:49.248
I'ts not gonna be me, I promise you that.

55:49.288 --> 55:51.794
As long as they're writing checks,
tell them they write one for me too.

55:52.110 --> 55:55.819
Because someone put me in a broken plane.
I'd love a check, Charlie.

55:55.889 --> 55:58.886
This toxicology report states
that you were drunk.

55:58.954 --> 56:01.354
And high on cocaine.

56:01.512 --> 56:04.084
Felony's punishable by up
to 12 years in prison.

56:04.184 --> 56:07.408
And if it is proven that your intoxication
was the cause of the death

56:07.429 --> 56:10.543
of four passengers, now we're gonna
look at four counts of manslaughter.

56:11.323 --> 56:13.634
That could be life in prison.

56:14.142 --> 56:17.376
Now can I please do my job your behalf...

56:18.331 --> 56:20.822
and kill this tox report?

56:25.225 --> 56:26.793
He's gonna get it done, Whip.

56:26.879 --> 56:28.836
He'll get it done, it's what
his whole life's about,

56:28.837 --> 56:30.980
trust me, trust him.

56:33.097 --> 56:35.316
You don't have to worry,
you'll walk away from this-

56:35.317 --> 56:36.813
I am not worried, Charlie.

56:38.247 --> 56:40.367
I promise you that I'm not worried.

56:40.444 --> 56:43.627
No one could have landed
that plane like I did.

56:44.884 --> 56:46.411
No one.

56:52.744 --> 56:54.433
– Thanks for coming.
– Yeah.

56:54.500 --> 56:56.333
Excuse me.

56:58.014 --> 56:59.761
– Excuse me.
– Yeah?

56:59.817 --> 57:03.246
Yeah, let me have a...
orange juice, large orange juice.

57:03.607 --> 57:05.385
Just orange juice?

57:05.846 --> 57:07.245
Yeah, uh...

57:07.355 --> 57:09.026
No. Uh...

57:10.195 --> 57:11.520
Double Stoli.

57:11.998 --> 57:13.118
Neat.

57:13.395 --> 57:17.493
<i>.. to me anyway, of a real American hero.
Is that your reading of it?</i>

57:17.570 --> 57:22.343
<i>Absolutely. However, remember
every situation is different.</i>

57:22.388 --> 57:25.612
<i>And the actions of the pilots
of SouthJet 2-2-7</i>

57:25.620 --> 57:27.331
<i>will be heavily scrutinized.</i>

57:27.485 --> 57:30.678
<i>Are you suggesting that there may
be more to this that leans behind?</i>

57:30.679 --> 57:34.763
<i>They're all answers. We don't have all of
the answers, we have a lot of questions.</i>

57:34.794 --> 57:38.294
<i>We're gonna have to wait until
some of those answers come in before...</i>

58:23.493 --> 58:26.226
The next morning...

58:27.881 --> 58:29.701
They're not gonna shot me...

58:30.878 --> 58:33.774
Aah, Taylor street.

59:22.924 --> 59:23.742
<i>Get out.</i>

59:23.743 --> 59:27.015
<i>The guy in Unit 1 just told me
you stayed here last night!</i>

59:29.601 --> 59:32.253
<i>What about my rent?
You owe me money, bitch.</i>

59:32.341 --> 59:34.213
– Don't touch me, Fran.
– Listen, I'm gonna...

59:34.237 --> 59:37.258
– Fuck, you will listen to me...
– Fran, get off me Frankie, you're...

59:37.882 --> 59:39.965
.. the fuck are you doin'?
Fuck off, man.

59:39.989 --> 59:42.580
Keep your fucking hands off her!

59:47.340 --> 59:49.348
Are you okay?

59:50.423 --> 59:52.988
Sorry, is this... is this
all the rest of your stuff?

59:53.357 --> 59:54.287
Uh, yeah.

59:54.436 --> 59:56.303
She still owe me 1100 dollars.

59:56.404 --> 59:58.493
Plus damages...
– Get out!

01:00:00.427 --> 01:00:02.347
What, you wanna sue her?

01:00:02.410 --> 01:00:05.714
Spend a 1000 bucks, or you wanna make
a cash deal with me? Make up your mind.

01:00:06.497 --> 01:00:07.970
Make up your mind!

01:00:09.221 --> 01:00:11.648
I take 700 cash.

01:00:12.660 --> 01:00:14.767
You're a hairy little creep, aren't you?

01:00:15.290 --> 01:00:17.270
Baseball bat bullshit.

01:00:21.528 --> 01:00:25.038
700 my ass. Here's 400 cash.

01:00:25.152 --> 01:00:27.210
Now be a good boy.

01:00:27.439 --> 01:00:30.077
Grab that box, put it in her car.

01:00:30.234 --> 01:00:32.513
Uh... but my car don’t run.

01:00:32.646 --> 01:00:35.466
It didn't start this morning,
I'm taking all this with me.

01:00:35.871 --> 01:00:37.673
– Your car doesn't run?
– Hmm-hmm.

01:00:38.766 --> 01:00:40.763
Well, what you're gonna do?

01:00:41.522 --> 01:00:42.922
Well I...

01:00:44.138 --> 01:00:46.590
I don't know what I was gonna do.

01:01:12.697 --> 01:01:14.521
What's your name?

01:01:14.974 --> 01:01:16.153
Whip.

01:01:20.841 --> 01:01:22.635
What?

01:01:23.585 --> 01:01:25.778
That's funny?

01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:33.137
Thank you.

01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:35.850
Captain Whip.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:52.747
You Okay?

01:01:53.052 --> 01:01:55.167
– Yeah. And you?
– Yeah.

01:01:55.413 --> 01:01:57.858
– You wan' a drink?
– No, thanks.

01:02:00.418 --> 01:02:02.923
Sure it's alright that I stay here?

01:02:03.010 --> 01:02:06.014
– Yes, it's alright that you stay here.

01:02:06.359 --> 01:02:08.536
I want you to stay.

01:02:10.812 --> 01:02:12.466
That knee hurtin' you?

01:02:13.216 --> 01:02:15.870
Yes is it.
Yes, sweetie.

01:02:22.691 --> 01:02:25.004
Thank you, Doctor.

01:02:27.095 --> 01:02:29.661
– It’s throbbing within...
– Yeah.

01:02:29.662 --> 01:02:33.239
Cos it's having a hard time
getting back to your heart.

01:02:41.934 --> 01:02:44.134
That's good though.

01:04:01.019 --> 01:04:03.347
You gonna shoot me?

01:04:03.348 --> 01:04:05.766
Or can I come inside?

01:04:05.767 --> 01:04:08.773
Yeah, come on inside, I shoot you inside.

01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:15.647
Listen, I... I thought we'd take a ride,
there's some I need to show you.

01:04:17.843 --> 01:04:19.243
I'm good.

01:04:24.941 --> 01:04:26.938
There it is.

01:04:28.233 --> 01:04:32.848
You can see... on initial impact,
the left wing hit the ground.

01:04:33.348 --> 01:04:35.050
I think if it would have
sheared off completely,

01:04:35.051 --> 01:04:36.787
everybody would have walked
away from this plane.

01:04:37.549 --> 01:04:40.024
Wing snapped off and it jaw opened the...

01:04:40.589 --> 01:04:44.532
engine cowling into the... rear fuselage.

01:04:44.571 --> 01:04:45.691
Yeah.

01:04:45.730 --> 01:04:48.610
If you were sitting in the last
six or seven rows it was...

01:04:48.697 --> 01:04:50.399
like being hit by a train.

01:04:51.716 --> 01:04:52.769
Who are they?

01:04:52.834 --> 01:04:55.687
The John the Baptist Pentecoastal Mission.

01:04:55.847 --> 01:04:57.798
They helped pull survivors
out of the wreckage.

01:04:57.799 --> 01:05:00.152
Now they come out here every day.

01:05:08.782 --> 01:05:12.001
And that is Ellen Block.

01:05:12.523 --> 01:05:14.332
She is the head of the NTSB investigation.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:17.367
She's the one that's gonna be
asking you the tough questions.

01:05:17.891 --> 01:05:20.631
I night the night before the flight.
I drank that morning too,

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:23.094
I used cocaine to help
straighten myself up.

01:05:23.945 --> 01:05:26.506
I know.
It's in the toxicology report.

01:05:26.507 --> 01:05:29.253
And it's not the reason why this happened.

01:05:29.809 --> 01:05:31.489
No, it's not.

01:05:32.643 --> 01:05:33.763
Listen.

01:05:34.790 --> 01:05:37.600
Clearly there was a mechanical
issue with the plane.

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:40.004
– Clearly.
– Yeah. But what you and I know...

01:05:40.785 --> 01:05:43.081
This was an "Act of God".

01:05:44.224 --> 01:05:47.194
And I'm gonna fight to get
the NTSB to add "Act of God"

01:05:47.195 --> 01:05:50.073
as one of the probable causes.

01:05:50.074 --> 01:05:52.876
Who’s God would do this?

01:06:04.058 --> 01:06:08.008
Here’s the deal. Avington Carr,
is the owner of the airline,

01:06:08.032 --> 01:06:11.704
He's on our side.
He's got big friends in Washington too.

01:06:12.527 --> 01:06:15.456
He wants to have a sit down with us
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock.

01:06:16.134 --> 01:06:17.954
– Really?
– Yeah.

01:06:18.559 --> 01:06:20.526
You can't drink, Captain.

01:06:22.117 --> 01:06:25.570
You're under the microscope right now.
You can't be seen buy a liquor.

01:06:25.712 --> 01:06:28.404
That means no bars... no drugs.

01:06:28.428 --> 01:06:30.686
– I understand. I won't drink,
I promise you.

01:06:31.397 --> 01:06:33.122
– Look, we can get you help...
– I don't need help-

01:06:33.130 --> 01:06:34.973
I won't drink, I promise you.

01:06:35.091 --> 01:06:37.872
I can stop. On my own.

01:06:38.433 --> 01:06:40.253
– Okay.
– Okay.

01:06:44.382 --> 01:06:46.545
– So ten O'clock-
– Ten O'clock, I got it.

01:06:46.546 --> 01:06:48.416
Avington Car.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:51.422
I never wanted that fucking airline.

01:06:51.564 --> 01:06:54.612
Neither did my brother.
It was my father that wanted it.

01:06:54.798 --> 01:06:56.100
I like baseball.

01:06:56.223 --> 01:06:57.420
– Oh, I like baseball.
– Everyone likes to watch baseball.

01:06:57.561 --> 01:06:59.098
Everybody enjoys to like baseball.

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.409
– The whole country likes baseball.

01:07:00.410 --> 01:07:01.682
– The whole country likes baseball.
– Cut the crap.

01:07:02.887 --> 01:07:05.400
So... what's the deal, Lenny?

01:07:05.525 --> 01:07:08.002
Is your union gonna survive this one?

01:07:08.298 --> 01:07:11.670
More importantly, how big a check
you think I’m gonna have to write?

01:07:11.682 --> 01:07:14.242
Well, you had six fatalities
on board your aircraft.

01:07:14.274 --> 01:07:17.099
No no, it's four, Lenny.
The two crew members don't count.

01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:21.030
I don't mean they don't count.

01:07:21.031 --> 01:07:23.193
They don't get settlements
like the passengers.

01:07:23.303 --> 01:07:26.373
Yeah, that’s a workman’s comp claim,
part of the union contract.

01:07:26.816 --> 01:07:29.893
They do dangerous job, they know it.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.452
You’re the lawyer for the pilots’ union?

01:07:32.468 --> 01:07:35.825
No sir, this is Hugh Lang, he's
the attorney we brought on

01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:38.409
to handle the criminal side of
Captain Whitaker’s situation.

01:07:40.391 --> 01:07:43.290
Yes, and what is Mr. Whitaker's situation?

01:07:43.682 --> 01:07:47.640
NTSB is up my ass with a flashlight,
we had to give them access to everything.

01:07:47.943 --> 01:07:49.991
Everbody's curious about Captain Whitaker.

01:07:50.034 --> 01:07:53.203
Well I flew with him in the Navy
and he is a great pilot.

01:07:53.430 --> 01:07:54.550
Huh.

01:07:55.792 --> 01:07:57.188
Is he a drunk?

01:08:01.217 --> 01:08:03.879
He's a heavy drinker.
But maybe I should bring in him?

01:08:03.903 --> 01:08:05.303
In a minute.

01:08:05.956 --> 01:08:08.395
Alright, so let’s get down to it, Lenny.

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:12.555
What does the union plan to do
about this blood test saying

01:08:12.792 --> 01:08:15.414
Whitaker was high on booze and coke?

01:08:15.721 --> 01:08:17.203
This guy’s a real peach.

01:08:17.419 --> 01:08:19.595
I'm gonna kill the toxicology report.

01:08:20.660 --> 01:08:23.562
The testing was done incompetently.

01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:28.643
The toxicology equipment they used
was last calibrated in June of 2009.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:31.372
It's already 18 months past code.

01:08:31.647 --> 01:08:35.770
Their log that should clearly state
who labeled the blood vials and when,

01:08:35.787 --> 01:08:39.729
is very incomplete, and they used a
preservative in the blood

01:08:39.803 --> 01:08:42.542
that has been known to cause fermentation,

01:08:42.782 --> 01:08:45.859
and in some cases register
higher in an alcohol test.

01:08:45.870 --> 01:08:49.502
Now, I have done all this, I've
only been here a few days. So...

01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:51.777
I wouldn't worry about it too much,
I can handle this.

01:08:52.274 --> 01:08:53.696
I like this guy, Lenny.

01:08:53.907 --> 01:08:56.890
Makes me wanna go out
sniff a few lines and fly a jet.

01:08:57.283 --> 01:08:58.399
Mr. Carr,

01:08:58.399 --> 01:09:02.374
we’re gonna fight to push all the fault
on the manufacturer, Jackson Ridgefield.

01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:05.986
And you think they’re gonna just open
their check book and buy us all lunch?

01:09:06.330 --> 01:09:08.015
Good fucking luck.

01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:10.179
What’s my exposure Jim?

01:09:11.555 --> 01:09:14.247
Well, the awards to the
families could kill the airline.

01:09:14.270 --> 01:09:15.408
Fuck the airline.

01:09:15.430 --> 01:09:17.529
The insurance companies
can have the goddamm airline.

01:09:17.624 --> 01:09:19.764
I just don’t want them come
sniffing in my other pockets.

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:24.028
Speaking for the pilots’ union, sir,
we don’t want to see your airline go away.

01:09:24.029 --> 01:09:25.935
We enjoy the contract you have with us.

01:09:26.281 --> 01:09:29.669
We gonna protect Captain Whitaker,
and in turn we gonna protect your airline.

01:09:30.691 --> 01:09:34.304
Does... Whitaker know he's goin' to jail?

01:09:34.974 --> 01:09:37.044
My client isn't goin' to jail, Mr. Carr.

01:09:37.082 --> 01:09:39.883
Oh, he's goin' to jail.
He belongs in jail.

01:09:39.993 --> 01:09:42.733
Bet your ass he's goin' to jail,
the only question is...

01:09:42.788 --> 01:09:44.823
is he gonna die in jail?

01:09:44.823 --> 01:09:46.857
You are wrong, Mr. Carr.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.442
Last time I checked, six counts
of manslaughter, it's life in prison.

01:09:51.170 --> 01:09:52.761
Life in prison...

01:09:53.198 --> 01:09:56.417
What we in Georgia call “all day long”.

01:10:04.351 --> 01:10:06.583
I hear you're some kind o' pilot.

01:10:33.335 --> 01:10:36.192
Theeere she is, there she is.

01:10:36.223 --> 01:10:40.254
Back to the meet?
Had a nice meeting?

01:10:43.268 --> 01:10:45.654
I know, it's okay, uh?

01:10:49.258 --> 01:10:50.658
It's okay...

01:10:51.425 --> 01:10:53.307
Yup, that's it.

01:10:59.764 --> 01:11:00.884
Me?

01:11:02.928 --> 01:11:04.328
That's it.

01:11:05.449 --> 01:11:07.847
Am I-No.
Yeah, no.

01:11:17.727 --> 01:11:20.646
<i>You wanna run the boy, you wanna be
a quarterback, let me see you run it back!</i>

01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:23.451
<i>So say "Dowdow", say "Kwakwa"!</i>

01:12:54.057 --> 01:12:56.519
– Good morning.
– Hello.

01:13:01.549 --> 01:13:03.804
You were in really
bad shape last night.

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:07.007
Yeah, true...
just tired.

01:13:09.726 --> 01:13:12.387
Drank a little bit too much.

01:13:12.607 --> 01:13:13.727
A bit?

01:13:15.315 --> 01:13:18.008
What, you won't count the fucking beers?

01:13:18.177 --> 01:13:19.685
I threw ‘em out.

01:13:20.787 --> 01:13:22.612
They're in the garbage, vodka too.

01:13:24.592 --> 01:13:26.171
Is that okay with you?

01:13:26.415 --> 01:13:27.635
More than okay.

01:13:32.619 --> 01:13:35.492
I’ve been watching the sky
change as the sun rises.

01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:39.173
Beautiful.

01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:42.953
I went out there, I took some great shots.

01:13:47.716 --> 01:13:50.470
It's just so beautiful here.

01:13:51.284 --> 01:13:52.915
You grew up here?

01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:55.264
No, Dad did.

01:13:58.279 --> 01:14:00.448
It's my grandfather's farm.

01:14:03.318 --> 01:14:04.347
Was.

01:14:06.136 --> 01:14:10.626
Dad was a pilot, he was a...
332nd airbone. He was a...

01:14:10.876 --> 01:14:13.524
Tuskee, he built that
landing strip out there.

01:14:15.209 --> 01:14:20.269
Crop dustin'. EPA shut him down, he...
traded the crop duster for...

01:14:21.007 --> 01:14:24.372
that old Cesna sittin'
out there in the barn.

01:14:26.523 --> 01:14:30.184
He flew that damn thing
all over the place.

01:14:32.866 --> 01:14:36.481
He died... I got divorced, and...

01:14:39.198 --> 01:14:41.711
been trying to sell the place ever since.

01:14:44.098 --> 01:14:45.869
What about your mom?

01:14:46.378 --> 01:14:47.705
Dead.

01:14:50.323 --> 01:14:51.938
You? What about your Dad?

01:14:52.717 --> 01:14:55.519
Well, I'm pretty sure he...
lives in Colorado.

01:14:55.668 --> 01:14:56.788
Yeah?

01:14:58.056 --> 01:14:59.530
No relationship?

01:15:00.403 --> 01:15:02.514
It was my mom that raised me.

01:15:02.515 --> 01:15:04.042
She was incredible.

01:15:05.515 --> 01:15:09.169
She held it together for so long,
I couldn’t tell how sick she was.

01:15:11.800 --> 01:15:15.142
We spent those last seven months
together like we were teenagers.

01:15:17.487 --> 01:15:21.630
We traded stories about
boys and... whatever.

01:15:24.923 --> 01:15:26.804
Oh, she loved me.

01:15:44.221 --> 01:15:45.867
My name's Trevor.

01:15:46.359 --> 01:15:48.681
You saved my mom.

01:16:00.802 --> 01:16:02.271
– It's great to see you, Whip.

01:16:02.272 --> 01:16:04.143
– It's great to see you, Whip.
– It's good to see you too.

01:16:10.269 --> 01:16:12.009
The service was so nice.

01:16:12.119 --> 01:16:14.815
I mean, all those people
who wanted to say goodbye.

01:16:16.856 --> 01:16:20.041
And Trina looked so beautiful in there.
Don't you think you?

01:16:20.738 --> 01:16:24.384
I mean, like she was gonna...
wake up and smile!

01:16:24.688 --> 01:16:28.076
I didn’t go in, Margaret.
I... I just couldn’t.

01:16:29.499 --> 01:16:30.590
Trevor...

01:16:31.293 --> 01:16:34.496
Find daddy, baby.
He's over there with Mr. Benton.

01:16:41.552 --> 01:16:43.830
You really should come
to the counseling group.

01:16:43.988 --> 01:16:46.134
The Union has great
people for us to talk to.

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:48.493
I can't.
Really I...

01:16:49.525 --> 01:16:50.645
I will.

01:16:54.045 --> 01:16:56.076
– Yeah. Well...
– Margaret.

01:16:57.866 --> 01:16:58.968
– You take care, okay, Whip?

01:16:58.969 --> 01:16:59.840
– You take care, okay, Whip?
– Okay.

01:17:00.496 --> 01:17:02.684
Listen, Margaret, I have a...

01:17:04.595 --> 01:17:06.947
You know, I'm in
the middle of this, uh...

01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:11.523
investigation. The NTSB
is investigating the crash.

01:17:11.553 --> 01:17:13.203
Yeah, I'm gonna talk to ‘em next week.

01:17:13.221 --> 01:17:17.007
Yeah. Well, I-I-
I'm a little nervous because...

01:17:18.214 --> 01:17:21.964
I was out the night
before the crash, the diner-

01:17:21.994 --> 01:17:22.931
Yeah. With Katerina.

01:17:22.973 --> 01:17:27.528
Right. And I had two glasses of wine,
and they're probably gonna ask you

01:17:27.637 --> 01:17:30.189
about my condition that morning, or

01:17:30.190 --> 01:17:32.990
whether you thought
I had anything to drink.

01:17:36.536 --> 01:17:37.983
What?

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:43.063
I've known you eleven years, Whip.

01:17:43.149 --> 01:17:44.004
Right.

01:17:44.286 --> 01:17:48.718
You want to tell me that you and Trina went
to diner and you had two glasses of wine,

01:17:48.727 --> 01:17:50.771
sounds like a nice restaurant,
now which one was it?

01:17:50.825 --> 01:17:53.705
You have to say that it was
an ordinary day, Margaret.

01:17:53.726 --> 01:17:57.275
I mean, it was an ordinary day.
You know me, I was in shape to fly.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:04.285
You have a problem saying that?

01:18:06.022 --> 01:18:08.809
It's a lie, Whip... It's a lie.

01:18:08.947 --> 01:18:11.453
Trina told me you two
hadn't been to sleep.

01:18:11.493 --> 01:18:14.045
Well, the... my lack of
sleep had nothing to do

01:18:14.062 --> 01:18:16.178
with that plane falling apart, Margaret.

01:18:16.574 --> 01:18:19.046
I'm just trying to get these things
straight, now you think any other pilot

01:18:19.047 --> 01:18:21.001
could have landed that plane
and saved more lives?

01:18:21.014 --> 01:18:21.936
I didn't say that, Whip,

01:18:21.952 --> 01:18:23.072
– Alright, then...
– I can't imagine another pilot...

01:18:23.093 --> 01:18:27.458
Imagine your son Trevor in this
church looking at you in that box,

01:18:27.467 --> 01:18:30.746
or my son visiting me in prison,
and for the next forty years-

01:18:30.757 --> 01:18:33.044
Please, Whip, enough.
Enough, Whip.

01:18:33.069 --> 01:18:35.253
Don't you think we've all had enough?

01:18:43.058 --> 01:18:44.821
I need this, Margaret.

01:18:52.338 --> 01:18:54.297
What d'you want me to say?

01:18:56.241 --> 01:18:57.668
I just...

01:18:59.242 --> 01:19:00.919
It was an ordinary day.

01:19:03.576 --> 01:19:07.105
The storm... after we took off...

01:19:07.416 --> 01:19:09.409
was very severe.

01:19:10.671 --> 01:19:13.668
But as far as the flight crew
is concerned, it was a...

01:19:14.591 --> 01:19:16.691
a perfectly ordinary day.

01:19:43.145 --> 01:19:44.494
You okay?

01:19:44.562 --> 01:19:46.213
Uh yeah, yeah.

01:19:47.012 --> 01:19:48.425
So?

01:19:48.627 --> 01:19:51.327
Well, I got through the first day,
they didn-t fire me,

01:19:51.390 --> 01:19:52.790
so...
– Then?

01:19:53.010 --> 01:19:55.945
And they need someone to work
the night shift, and they asked me,

01:19:56.052 --> 01:19:58.125
it’s time and a half so...

01:19:59.731 --> 01:20:01.541
I got a vest...

01:20:02.354 --> 01:20:04.588
and a... well, name tag,
I got you something.

01:20:04.688 --> 01:20:06.508
– Yeah?
– Yeah.

01:20:06.602 --> 01:20:08.002
Thank you.

01:20:10.754 --> 01:20:11.737
– It is a P-51 mustang.

01:20:11.738 --> 01:20:13.174
– It is a P-51 mustang.
– I know it's a P-51.

01:20:13.205 --> 01:20:13.902
– Your daddy fly one of these?

01:20:13.903 --> 01:20:14.915
– Your daddy fly one of these?
– Yes, he did.

01:20:16.303 --> 01:20:18.246
It cause for celebration.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:21.488
Oh well, I promised Sheila that
I'd go to this AA meeting now.

01:20:21.932 --> 01:20:23.755
She's my sponsor, the one
that's been helping me,

01:20:23.758 --> 01:20:25.185
can we celebrate tomorrow night?

01:20:26.171 --> 01:20:27.270
Yeah.

01:20:28.011 --> 01:20:29.856
Yeah sure, why not?

01:20:33.667 --> 01:20:36.621
You know, you can come with me...
to the meeting.

01:20:36.862 --> 01:20:39.494
It's an open meeting,
meaning that anyone can come.

01:20:40.396 --> 01:20:41.437
Even you!

01:20:43.246 --> 01:20:45.603
So the cops got a flashlight on
me behind the dumpster, I'm...

01:20:45.622 --> 01:20:47.321
I'm wearing nothing but
my girlfriend’s panties,

01:20:47.335 --> 01:20:49.395
I got vomitin' on the
front of my chest,

01:20:50.247 --> 01:20:54.028
and I say to him:
"Uh... I might have had two beers."

01:21:01.089 --> 01:21:03.608
So that's why I get the nickname:
"Two-Beer Barry".

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:09.164
I'm getting the, uh... the
stink eye from Ed over here,

01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:10.766
have I gone off format?

01:21:12.064 --> 01:21:14.389
My name is Barry and I'm an alcoholic.

01:21:14.515 --> 01:21:15.796
Hi Barry.

01:21:15.855 --> 01:21:18.938
Are there any other alcoholics present?

01:21:24.248 --> 01:21:27.338
I always love a meeting where
we all have to identify the tab,

01:21:27.347 --> 01:21:30.836
because it forces me to be
honest about who I really am.

01:21:32.473 --> 01:21:37.026
And I never told the truth out there,
obviously I lied about everything.

01:21:38.527 --> 01:21:41.566
I was told in these rooms that
I was never sober if I kept lying,

01:21:41.574 --> 01:21:43.319
but that's what I was best at.

01:21:46.026 --> 01:21:48.313
If I knew anything in this
world, it was how to lie,

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.639
especially about my drinking.
But...

01:21:51.849 --> 01:21:55.072
whatever, I would lie about
the name of my dog,

01:21:55.073 --> 01:21:58.336
I'd lie about the color of my
own hair right to your face.

01:22:00.012 --> 01:22:05.236
My whole life just became... a series
of lies, strung together by me,

01:22:05.257 --> 01:22:06.637
I gotta go.

01:22:07.043 --> 01:22:08.163
Sure.

01:22:08.636 --> 01:22:11.274
Oh yeah, Sheila, she can
give me a ride, does she?

01:22:11.953 --> 01:22:13.073
I'm Sheila.

01:22:33.356 --> 01:22:37.049
<i>I’ve been speaking to some people who
are very close to the NTSB investigation,</i>

01:22:37.059 --> 01:22:40.338
<i>and they are confident they will
soon be able to determine exactly</i>

01:22:40.340 --> 01:22:41.939
<i>what brought this plane down.</i>

01:22:41.946 --> 01:22:44.515
<i>I'm sure they will, sir.</i>

01:22:44.516 --> 01:22:47.536
<i>Well, Ken and Vicki Evans,
thank you very much.</i>

01:22:47.552 --> 01:22:50.433
<i>Thank you sir. God bless you.</i>

01:23:02.735 --> 01:23:04.991
How you feeling, Ken?

01:23:06.754 --> 01:23:08.463
I'm happy to be alive.

01:23:08.545 --> 01:23:10.735
Blessed... to be alive.

01:23:13.071 --> 01:23:16.021
I'm Captain Whitaker, I was...
flying the-

01:23:16.032 --> 01:23:17.418
I know who you are.

01:23:18.867 --> 01:23:22.177
Excuse me. Can you give us
some privacy, please?

01:23:22.248 --> 01:23:23.761
Thank you.

01:23:35.178 --> 01:23:37.285
So, uh...

01:23:37.543 --> 01:23:39.363
How long have you been out of the...

01:23:39.726 --> 01:23:41.566
– Out of the coma?
– Yeah.

01:23:42.383 --> 01:23:43.778
Two days.

01:23:48.526 --> 01:23:52.148
Well, uh, look, I don't wanna...
disrupt your whole day,

01:23:53.079 --> 01:23:57.920
God knows you've been...
swamped by interviews, and...

01:23:59.475 --> 01:24:02.410
You looked brillant on the CNN,
by the way.

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:06.643
Both my legs are crushed.
My pelvis is snapped.

01:24:07.543 --> 01:24:12.046
I'll probably never walk again.
Al least not without a walker or braces.

01:24:13.132 --> 01:24:15.333
I'll certainly never fly again.

01:24:16.542 --> 01:24:18.138
I'm very sorry, Ken.

01:24:18.864 --> 01:24:22.096
That plane was doomed
the moment you sat in that cockpit.

01:24:22.848 --> 01:24:25.890
You reeked like gin or somethin’.

01:24:26.315 --> 01:24:29.115
I called Vicki from the plane
before we took off.

01:24:30.532 --> 01:24:33.044
That’s when the rain kicked up.

01:24:34.418 --> 01:24:38.470
Well, I don’t know how much
you remember, but...

01:24:39.094 --> 01:24:40.662
that plane...

01:24:41.131 --> 01:24:42.967
it started falling apart, Ken.

01:24:43.117 --> 01:24:45.810
I remember everything until the crash.

01:24:46.095 --> 01:24:47.700
I know what went wrong.

01:24:50.075 --> 01:24:53.088
What are you trying to say, Ken?
What do we talk?

01:24:54.023 --> 01:24:57.270
I do not know, Captain Whitaker.
What are we talking about?

01:24:57.298 --> 01:25:00.543
I'm just trying to get a sense from you...

01:25:01.544 --> 01:25:05.346
about what you thought caused the crash.

01:25:06.645 --> 01:25:10.642
Was it the fact that you got on the
plane still drunk from the night before?

01:25:12.490 --> 01:25:16.519
The NTSB is coming back tomorrow
to finish taking a deposition from me...

01:25:17.725 --> 01:25:19.574
about the events on that flight.

01:25:20.006 --> 01:25:24.144
Do you think you... be alive
if I wasn't flying that plane?

01:25:25.404 --> 01:25:26.409
No.

01:25:27.437 --> 01:25:29.094
We'd all be dead.

01:25:29.859 --> 01:25:33.716
But you gonna argue with me
that your physical state was tip-top?

01:25:39.271 --> 01:25:40.521
Wait.

01:25:41.170 --> 01:25:42.355
Sit...

01:25:43.128 --> 01:25:44.442
Please.

01:25:50.131 --> 01:25:53.027
I never shared my opinion
about your physical state...

01:25:53.434 --> 01:25:55.261
the morning of the flight.

01:25:56.268 --> 01:25:57.695
I never said a word.

01:26:00.228 --> 01:26:02.445
That crash was pre-ordained.

01:26:03.850 --> 01:26:05.730
I prayed on it, Captain.

01:26:05.911 --> 01:26:07.957
Vicky and I both prayed on it.

01:26:08.797 --> 01:26:10.261
There's only one judge, sir.

01:26:10.379 --> 01:26:11.714
Praise Jesus!

01:26:11.926 --> 01:26:14.033
And he's got a higher plan for you.

01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:19.314
This event... although it's
tragic in his loss of life...

01:26:21.298 --> 01:26:23.601
it's also a celebration of life.

01:26:24.612 --> 01:26:27.492
Nothing happens in the kingdom
of the Lord by mistake, sir.

01:26:27.494 --> 01:26:29.108
Praise Jesus!

01:26:29.199 --> 01:26:30.513
Captain...

01:26:31.746 --> 01:26:33.205
Will you pray with us?

01:26:45.556 --> 01:26:49.606
Jesus, our Savior, we thank you
for blessing Captain Whitaker.

01:26:49.607 --> 01:26:52.984
For guiding his hand
on that fateful morning.

01:26:54.226 --> 01:26:55.903
– Bye.
– It's on the right.

01:26:55.962 --> 01:26:57.895
– Thanks for the ride.
– Okay.

01:27:22.126 --> 01:27:23.650
Oh hey, look.

01:27:24.471 --> 01:27:26.037
Great, ain't it?

01:27:26.199 --> 01:27:27.225
It's kind of beautiful.

01:27:27.226 --> 01:27:29.009
It is beautiful, I know, like you.

01:27:29.043 --> 01:27:31.267
– Does it work?
– Yes it works.

01:27:31.398 --> 01:27:33.630
I learned how to fly on this baby.

01:27:33.921 --> 01:27:37.356
Me and my friend Harling, we...
we flew to Jamaica.

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:38.779
– Jamaica, in this?

01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:40.225
– Jamaica, in this?
– Yeah, in this.

01:27:40.498 --> 01:27:42.995
We went on a overnight fishing trip about

01:27:43.198 --> 01:27:45.581
two hours south to here,
and next thing you know,

01:27:45.926 --> 01:27:47.464
Bethel, Jamaica.

01:27:48.471 --> 01:27:50.493
– You're insane.
– Yes, I am.

01:27:50.770 --> 01:27:53.510
It was beautiful, just like a... postcard,

01:27:53.518 --> 01:27:56.781
you know, one of those
gipsy postcards with...

01:27:56.797 --> 01:28:00.486
white sand, beautiful... sky, blue seas.

01:28:01.813 --> 01:28:03.709
It's the most beautiful thing I ever saw.

01:28:05.551 --> 01:28:08.243
Was the water warm?

01:28:08.424 --> 01:28:09.671
Yes, that was very warm.

01:28:09.773 --> 01:28:10.893
That’s my kind of place.

01:28:12.640 --> 01:28:13.827
Let's go.

01:28:14.773 --> 01:28:16.090
Sure, why not.

01:28:17.458 --> 01:28:18.916
Yeah, let's go tomorrow.

01:28:19.538 --> 01:28:20.530
Oh, you're serious?

01:28:20.562 --> 01:28:23.747
I'm very serious. We go in the morning.
You know, let's just get out of here.

01:28:24.161 --> 01:28:25.526
To start over.
– Wait, we can't-

01:28:25.557 --> 01:28:28.570
Yes we can, it will be beautiful,

01:28:28.751 --> 01:28:30.436
these light bright sand beaches,
it's just-

01:28:30.460 --> 01:28:32.098
– I'm worried about you.
– It's paradise.

01:28:32.110 --> 01:28:34.084
Don't worry about me, I'm fine, thank you.

01:28:34.114 --> 01:28:36.455
– Whip, you're not, you're really not.
– Yes I am...

01:28:36.456 --> 01:28:37.590
Yes I am.
– You need help.

01:28:39.043 --> 01:28:40.782
You need rehab, Whip.

01:28:42.969 --> 01:28:46.763
Is it, I need a rehab? So you go
to two AA meetings and I need...?

01:28:47.279 --> 01:28:48.193
Okay.

01:28:48.244 --> 01:28:51.694
Hey look, I won't-Jesus Christ,
don't worry about me, okay?

01:28:51.721 --> 01:28:54.611
You just worry about yourself,
don't worry about me.

01:28:54.882 --> 01:28:56.871
– We're the same, you and me.
– No, we are not the same,

01:28:56.879 --> 01:28:58.246
– Yeah we are.
– we are not the same,

01:28:58.254 --> 01:28:59.918
I don't suck dick to get high, okay?

01:28:59.982 --> 01:29:02.261
Don't give me that "your mother died..."
– I never...

01:29:02.269 --> 01:29:03.853
– and your father...
– I never in my life...

01:29:03.861 --> 01:29:05.899
Bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

01:29:05.901 --> 01:29:06.865
Is that why you shot dope?

01:29:06.866 --> 01:29:07.680
Is that why you shot dope?
– That's not fair.

01:29:07.687 --> 01:29:09.101
That's why you get high?

01:29:09.188 --> 01:29:11.248
There’s a whole lot of people
out there whose mother died,

01:29:11.256 --> 01:29:12.208
they don't fucking drink.

01:29:12.209 --> 01:29:12.779
they don't fucking drink.
– You're sick, Whip.

01:29:12.788 --> 01:29:15.467
Yeah, well I die and brace it, shit!

01:29:16.585 --> 01:29:18.268
– I choose to drink.
– You do?

01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:19.686
– Yes I do.
– You choose it, well

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.345
I don't see a whole lot
of choice going on here.

01:29:21.347 --> 01:29:25.025
I choose to drink, and I blame myself.
I'm happy to.

01:29:25.741 --> 01:29:28.859
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

01:29:29.538 --> 01:29:32.879
I got an... ex-wife and
a son I never talk to.

01:29:33.719 --> 01:29:37.044
And you know why?
Because I choose to drink!

01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.040
Nicole.

01:29:57.405 --> 01:29:59.145
Hey. Listen.

01:30:03.564 --> 01:30:04.898
Alright, look...

01:30:07.506 --> 01:30:11.269
I was loaded when... the plane crashed.

01:30:12.295 --> 01:30:14.511
With this investigation, I don't
know what's gonna happen,

01:30:14.527 --> 01:30:16.574
I could go to jail
for the rest of my life.

01:30:18.168 --> 01:30:20.127
I gotta get out of here.

01:30:22.336 --> 01:30:24.403
And I want you to come with me.

01:30:26.005 --> 01:30:27.125
Whip.

01:30:32.174 --> 01:30:34.899
I'm afraid that I'm going
to use again, d'you understand?

01:30:34.939 --> 01:30:36.446
Then come with me.

01:30:37.147 --> 01:30:39.676
Just come with me.
I need help. I do.

01:30:40.983 --> 01:30:42.285
I'd like it if you got help.

01:30:42.310 --> 01:30:45.800
I'll get help, we go straight to Jamaica,
we go right to the local hospital.

01:30:45.831 --> 01:30:47.231
I'll do it.

01:30:47.548 --> 01:30:50.053
For you, I'll do anyting.
Anything you want.

01:30:53.982 --> 01:30:55.573
I don't want to use again.

01:30:57.086 --> 01:31:00.293
I can't. I won’t
make it back, Whip.

01:31:02.135 --> 01:31:03.664
I won't force you to stay.

01:31:03.940 --> 01:31:06.453
If you don't like it,
if I'm not sober, whatever,

01:31:06.558 --> 01:31:09.608
then you leave,
I promise you you can leave.

01:31:13.581 --> 01:31:17.539
We can leave before noon.
I’m a great pilot.

01:31:17.797 --> 01:31:20.800
So many beautiful things to see, I just...

01:31:22.318 --> 01:31:25.455
I just want you to come with me.

01:32:25.344 --> 01:32:26.557
– Everything okay, sweetie?

01:32:26.582 --> 01:32:28.082
– Everything okay, sweetie?
Yeah. Okay.

01:32:36.684 --> 01:32:37.804
Nicole.

01:32:39.321 --> 01:32:40.441
Nicole?

01:33:10.398 --> 01:33:12.731
<i>You’ve reached the Whitaker
Crop Dusting Company.</i>

01:33:12.747 --> 01:33:15.300
<i>Please leave a message
and it will be returned.</i>

01:33:16.536 --> 01:33:18.137
<i>Hey Whip, if you're there, pick up.</i>

01:33:18.138 --> 01:33:19.966
<i>It's Charlie, I got some good news.</i>

01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:42.141
Hello?

01:33:53.187 --> 01:33:55.411
Aah, there's our man!

01:33:55.574 --> 01:33:56.544
Hey!

01:33:58.208 --> 01:34:00.028
Captain Whitaker.

01:34:00.516 --> 01:34:02.982
Let me be the first
to say congratulations.

01:34:03.052 --> 01:34:04.823
It's a good day. We've won.

01:34:05.287 --> 01:34:07.556
Yeah, this is what we call
in my profession a "walk-over".

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:10.096
Yeah, they sheduled the
hearing, it's ten days away,

01:34:10.126 --> 01:34:11.975
they can be tough, but
you just got to be sharp,

01:34:11.987 --> 01:34:14.264
stay focused, answer
the questions correctly.

01:34:14.280 --> 01:34:15.840
That's right, then we're good.

01:34:15.854 --> 01:34:18.087
Right, I successfully
had an “Act of God”

01:34:18.088 --> 01:34:20.480
added to the NTSB's list
of probable causes,

01:34:20.504 --> 01:34:22.251
we've shifted suspicion away from you.

01:34:22.261 --> 01:34:25.776
It's no longer a question of your
condition, but the condition of the plane.

01:34:26.381 --> 01:34:28.706
That's what I've been
trying to tell everybody.

01:34:29.305 --> 01:34:30.471
Broken plane.

01:34:30.659 --> 01:34:32.182
That's right.

01:34:32.432 --> 01:34:35.327
About the... the toxocologiy report?

01:34:35.328 --> 01:34:37.155
Oh, I killed that.

01:34:38.123 --> 01:34:41.110
There is no physical proof that
you were intoxicated on that plane,

01:34:41.118 --> 01:34:42.428
and no eyewitnesses.

01:34:42.499 --> 01:34:45.311
Why we're here?
We're good!?

01:34:45.858 --> 01:34:48.898
Uh... Because there is a...
a small problem.

01:34:48.922 --> 01:34:51.637
Because of the turbulence,
there was no drink service on the flight.

01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:56.299
But they did find two empty
vodka bottles in the galley trash.

01:34:56.628 --> 01:34:58.028
Yeah... uhm...

01:34:58.465 --> 01:35:00.816
And there's no physical
evidence on the bottles,

01:35:00.823 --> 01:35:03.652
no DNA, no fingerprints to link
them to anyone, but

01:35:03.665 --> 01:35:05.334
they were uncapped and empty.

01:35:05.545 --> 01:35:08.628
And the only people who would
have had access to those bottles

01:35:08.853 --> 01:35:10.327
would be the flight crew.

01:35:10.570 --> 01:35:14.255
Now Margaret Evans and Camelia Satou,

01:35:14.561 --> 01:35:18.503
they all had clean tox reports.
So that only leaves you,

01:35:18.613 --> 01:35:19.925
– and, uh...
– Trina Marquez.

01:35:19.958 --> 01:35:21.915
Right, Trina Marquez.

01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:24.990
Okay.

01:35:26.497 --> 01:35:29.135
Okay, I see where we're going here.

01:35:30.015 --> 01:35:33.044
That's funny tough, you know,
they only found two bottles.

01:35:33.212 --> 01:35:33.958
– Why's that?

01:35:33.959 --> 01:35:35.245
– Why's that?
– I drank three.

01:35:36.836 --> 01:35:38.653
One's missing.

01:35:40.547 --> 01:35:42.951
You know, when I first met you,

01:35:43.092 --> 01:35:46.497
I couldn't believe what a drunk
arrogant scumbag you were.

01:35:46.507 --> 01:35:47.395
– Oh really?
– Yeah.

01:35:47.411 --> 01:35:48.197
Oh, thank you, you-

01:35:48.205 --> 01:35:50.277
But I did the research, Captain Whitaker.

01:35:50.291 --> 01:35:52.163
I heard the expert analyzes

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:54.234
and I got to tell you,
I’m in awe of what you did.

01:35:55.156 --> 01:35:59.583
The FAA and the NTSB took ten pilots,
placed them in simulators,

01:35:59.590 --> 01:36:02.970
recreated the events that led to
this plane falling out of the sky.

01:36:03.256 --> 01:36:06.199
Do you know how many of them
were able to safely land the planes?

01:36:06.614 --> 01:36:07.520
Not one.

01:36:07.926 --> 01:36:10.004
Every pilot crashed the aircraft.

01:36:10.218 --> 01:36:11.630
Killed everybody on board.

01:36:11.715 --> 01:36:13.252
You're the only one who could do it.

01:36:13.591 --> 01:36:14.377
Great.

01:36:15.966 --> 01:36:16.912
I'm going home.

01:36:16.913 --> 01:36:17.651
I'm going home.
– Hey.

01:36:17.752 --> 01:36:19.452
Captain Whitaker, I'm telling you right now,
– Whip, Whip, you can't...

01:36:19.454 --> 01:36:21.226
– you walk away, you're going to prison.
– Listen man.

01:36:21.294 --> 01:36:22.823
I'm trying to save your fucking life.

01:36:22.838 --> 01:36:24.151
What fucking life?

01:36:24.699 --> 01:36:27.181
Uh? Don’t kill yourself
on my account, Hugh!

01:36:27.288 --> 01:36:31.199
Captain Whitaker, this NTSB hearing
is a federal agency hearing.

01:36:31.215 --> 01:36:31.725
Do you understand that?

01:36:31.726 --> 01:36:32.871
Do you understand that?
– Yes, I understand that.

01:36:32.892 --> 01:36:35.569
Okay, well we can't play
around with these people.

01:36:35.888 --> 01:36:38.549
Now we walk in there
like this, with this...

01:36:38.870 --> 01:36:40.149
we're done.

01:36:40.223 --> 01:36:42.580
Everything we've done
goes right out the window.

01:36:43.471 --> 01:36:47.312
I have no more moves, alright?
It's all on you right now.

01:36:50.925 --> 01:36:53.674
Ok, Charlie, just get him
to the church on time.

01:36:53.924 --> 01:36:55.999
Get him to the church on time.

01:36:56.002 --> 01:37:00.790
Yeah Charlie, just keep him nice and
sober, so he can save your fucking union.

01:37:00.929 --> 01:37:05.176
Uh? And that fucking airline.
Fuck you Charlie, fuck you.

01:38:07.595 --> 01:38:08.853
It's him.

01:38:09.259 --> 01:38:11.079
Yeah. It's him already.

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:19.410
How you doin'?

01:38:20.241 --> 01:38:21.572
What are you doing here?

01:38:23.012 --> 01:38:25.384
It's good to see you too, Deana.
May I come in?

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:29.735
I just thought I'd come by and...

01:38:30.299 --> 01:38:32.414
see how you and Will were doing.
Will?

01:38:32.563 --> 01:38:33.789
Knuckles?

01:38:34.714 --> 01:38:37.118
I'd like-you know, we
haven’t talked in a while,

01:38:37.121 --> 01:38:40.692
so with the thing that happened I just
thought I'd come by and we'd... talk.

01:38:41.752 --> 01:38:44.030
You know that I prefer
that you call us.

01:38:44.131 --> 01:38:46.574
Right, right, to call you, but I mean...

01:38:47.945 --> 01:38:50.856
Not like anybody around here calls me...

01:38:50.945 --> 01:38:53.808
the last three years only
to ask for some money.

01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:56.471
Have you been drinking?

01:38:56.791 --> 01:38:58.291
Well, that didn't take long, did it?

01:38:58.338 --> 01:39:02.136
Right... 17 seconds...
Yeah, exactly 17 seconds.

01:39:02.294 --> 01:39:04.260
– Ladies and gentlemen, it took exactly
– Fucking hell, could you just leave!

01:39:04.261 --> 01:39:08.112
17 seconds before my ex-wife Deana
Coleman asked me if I was drinking,

01:39:08.113 --> 01:39:09.313
what the hell.
– Just leave!

01:39:09.314 --> 01:39:11.826
A world record. Leave the house
that I pay for.

01:39:11.839 --> 01:39:13.740
Is that you want me to do?
– Oh. I'll call the police.

01:39:13.764 --> 01:39:14.701
Call the police.

01:39:15.104 --> 01:39:16.109
– I'm telling you-
– Will!

01:39:16.125 --> 01:39:18.054
Whitaker Jr! How're you doing, son?

01:39:18.297 --> 01:39:21.163
Man of the house.
Thanks for calling me back.

01:39:21.164 --> 01:39:23.411
I'm telling you to leave.

01:39:24.467 --> 01:39:25.867
Are you?

01:39:26.342 --> 01:39:27.706
You're the man of the house now.

01:39:27.736 --> 01:39:29.880
You upset my mother.
You gotta go.

01:39:29.970 --> 01:39:31.672
Oh, you- Well, I’m your father, tough guy.

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:32.917
You're a drunk.

01:39:34.578 --> 01:39:37.139
I'm a drunk?
You don't know who the fuck I am.

01:39:37.154 --> 01:39:39.483
I sure don't!
Won't you tell me!

01:39:39.484 --> 01:39:41.739
Who the fuck are you, uh?
Who are you?

01:39:42.606 --> 01:39:44.322
Get the fuck out.

01:39:47.013 --> 01:39:48.159
Stop it! Stop it!

01:39:48.338 --> 01:39:49.573
Stop it! Stop it!

01:39:49.588 --> 01:39:51.190
– I love you son.
– Get the fuck out!

01:39:51.565 --> 01:39:54.429
– Get the fuck out!
– Get out now!

01:39:55.402 --> 01:39:57.313
I know where I'm not wanted.

01:39:58.398 --> 01:40:01.390
Captain Whitaker, a lot of people are
working to keep you out of the media,

01:40:01.406 --> 01:40:02.506
are you hiding something?

01:40:02.522 --> 01:40:04.585
Leave my family some room, please.

01:40:04.601 --> 01:40:09.489
This is not the appropriate time,
at the appropriate time, I will, uh...

01:40:09.802 --> 01:40:11.870
tell my story, and uh...

01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:14.002
now is the time for grieving.

01:40:14.765 --> 01:40:16.585
<i>And uh...</i>

01:40:16.833 --> 01:40:18.706
<i>taking care of the injured. Thank you.</i>

01:40:19.525 --> 01:40:22.325
<i>.. questions remain about the flight,
but they won't be answered today,</i>

01:40:22.338 --> 01:40:26.367
<i>as Captain Whitaker politely asked
that we give his familly some peace.</i>

01:40:26.408 --> 01:40:30.554
<i>A reasonable request from a quiet
heroic man, who’s been through-</i>

01:40:30.569 --> 01:40:31.944
Hey Charlie.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.767
Look, it's just that I just
couldn't find a safe place, uh,

01:40:37.777 --> 01:40:39.729
Amanda was kind enough
to let me in, and-

01:40:39.745 --> 01:40:40.767
– Yeah, I know.
– Thank you.

01:40:40.771 --> 01:40:42.214
Are you sure I can't get you something...

01:40:42.229 --> 01:40:43.865
No. We're trough.

01:40:43.913 --> 01:40:46.319
But thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:40:48.247 --> 01:40:49.854
Now what the hell is wrong with you?

01:40:50.565 --> 01:40:51.596
Really...

01:40:52.248 --> 01:40:55.425
Hugh just called me, apparently
you went to your ex-wife's house,

01:40:55.499 --> 01:40:58.048
drunk as a skunk, the news crew showed up,

01:40:58.064 --> 01:40:59.824
and then the police escort you out!

01:40:59.857 --> 01:41:01.839
It’s okay, though.
I’ve been watching, it’s okay.

01:41:01.857 --> 01:41:04.245
Oh yeah, no, Hugh checked
all the media outlet that covered,

01:41:04.277 --> 01:41:06.399
you come off- you come off fine,
so I guess we're good.

01:41:06.401 --> 01:41:08.483
Good, ok, good, ok,
here's the deal. I-

01:41:08.484 --> 01:41:10.859
No Whip, Whip, there's no deal.
Sorry, look at you.

01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:14.711
I got no idea what you’re gonna do
or say, ever. You’re all over the place.

01:41:14.727 --> 01:41:17.186
I was the one guy in your court.
The one guy.

01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:20.223
I was your defender and
your apologist, but no more!

01:41:20.438 --> 01:41:21.700
Charlie, I can do this.

01:41:21.827 --> 01:41:24.606
You're about to be questioned
by a Federal agency about

01:41:24.624 --> 01:41:28.926
piloting an airliner drunk, an airliner
that crashed, and you continue to drink!

01:41:29.022 --> 01:41:31.482
And stumble around. What kind
of crazy ya have to be to do that?

01:41:31.545 --> 01:41:33.863
I'm afraid of you.
– Ok alright, let me stay with you.

01:41:34.108 --> 01:41:36.215
Let me stay with you, they're
staking out all my houses anyway,

01:41:36.222 --> 01:41:38.016
I'll stay with you, until... until...

01:41:38.105 --> 01:41:41.212
you know un- un-
until the hearing.

01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:43.480
I won't leave the house.

01:41:46.293 --> 01:41:48.583
I won't.

01:41:49.938 --> 01:41:51.127
– You cannot drink in my house.

01:41:51.128 --> 01:41:52.288
– You cannot drink in my house.
– I won't, I won't, I won't.

01:41:52.299 --> 01:41:53.882
You can't have a drink.

01:41:55.132 --> 01:41:56.532
I won't.

01:42:03.010 --> 01:42:04.891
– Officer Edmonds.
– Yes sir.

01:42:05.509 --> 01:42:07.561
Whip, this is officer Edmonds,
he'll be staying here tonight.

01:42:07.648 --> 01:42:09.264
Any problems, he’ll handle it.

01:42:13.235 --> 01:42:15.264
Captain Whitaker.
You...

01:42:15.928 --> 01:42:18.021
you look great.
I mean that.

01:42:18.360 --> 01:42:20.209
Thank you. Thank you very much.
I feel good.

01:42:20.652 --> 01:42:22.845
Charlie tells me you haven't
had a drink in eight days.

01:42:23.034 --> 01:42:26.392
Nine days. Two hours, 26 minutes,
but who's counting?

01:42:26.518 --> 01:42:29.116
Okay. Right here.

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:33.264
So yeah, we want to make this
as easy as possible...

01:42:33.322 --> 01:42:34.866
on you, I hope this is okay.

01:42:34.898 --> 01:42:37.085
Maybe just relax, and get some rest,

01:42:37.166 --> 01:42:39.123
order up a steak, get a movie.

01:42:39.601 --> 01:42:44.884
I made a copy of the entire...
investigation, my file on you.

01:42:45.976 --> 01:42:49.497
I was trying to anticipate what kinds of
questions they might ask you under oath,

01:42:49.678 --> 01:42:52.652
and I wrote some
non-damaging responses, so...

01:42:52.807 --> 01:42:56.468
It's all in there. You know,
it's photos, and... interviews,

01:42:56.502 --> 01:42:58.172
there's some testimony in there.

01:42:58.773 --> 01:43:01.563
Called Ellen Block, told her
you're here, you're all tucked in.

01:43:02.637 --> 01:43:04.244
She got the knife out for me?

01:43:06.526 --> 01:43:09.812
Well, look. She... she's not happy
that I killed the tox report, but

01:43:09.864 --> 01:43:13.986
this isn't a trial. So she's very limited
in the kinds of questions she can ask you.

01:43:14.054 --> 01:43:15.723
You know. You're gonna be fine.

01:43:15.912 --> 01:43:19.995
Yeah. The hearing's at ten,
so uh... just downstairs, so

01:43:20.005 --> 01:43:22.838
well I think we can meet here at nine
for breakfast in our room,

01:43:23.104 --> 01:43:24.656
and, uh...

01:43:25.076 --> 01:43:26.562
take it from there.

01:43:27.553 --> 01:43:29.637
Alright, captain Whitaker.
See you in the morning.

01:43:29.653 --> 01:43:32.463
Thank you, and thank you...
for letting me stay in your house,

01:43:32.477 --> 01:43:34.187
you have a beautiful home,
beautiful family, and-

01:43:34.188 --> 01:43:35.326
You did great. I'm happy.

01:43:35.345 --> 01:43:36.513
I needed it. I needed it.

01:43:36.990 --> 01:43:39.131
– It's alright.
– I'm happy we did it.

01:43:40.195 --> 01:43:40.956
– Alright,
– Okay.

01:43:40.957 --> 01:43:42.286
– see you in the morning.
– Yes.

01:43:51.471 --> 01:43:52.978
Looks like fine...

01:46:13.994 --> 01:46:15.114
Hello?

01:46:36.757 --> 01:46:37.877
Hello?

01:48:58.778 --> 01:48:59.763
– How's our man?

01:48:59.764 --> 01:49:01.346
– How's our man?
– Not a peep.

01:49:09.363 --> 01:49:11.542
Maybe he overslept.

01:49:12.782 --> 01:49:15.131
Didn't let any girls in there
last night, did you?

01:49:15.303 --> 01:49:16.423
No sir.

01:49:16.822 --> 01:49:20.148
Not a soul, no one came in or
out outside of... room service.

01:49:25.661 --> 01:49:27.082
You have a key?

01:49:27.839 --> 01:49:29.214
Hey Whip.

01:49:29.995 --> 01:49:32.352
Hey buddy?
Whip!

01:49:32.673 --> 01:49:33.793
Shit.

01:49:36.953 --> 01:49:39.935
– Where the fucking fuck is he?
– Oh Jeez.

01:49:40.092 --> 01:49:42.036
Where is he?
Where is he, where is he?

01:49:42.063 --> 01:49:42.789
I don't know.

01:49:42.799 --> 01:49:44.789
Did he fucking walk away?
Son of a bitch!

01:49:44.828 --> 01:49:46.012
Hugh. Hugh.

01:49:46.013 --> 01:49:46.765
Whip!

01:49:48.149 --> 01:49:49.293
Get a med- Yak, damnit!

01:49:49.294 --> 01:49:51.115
– Oh no, is he dead?
– I don't know.

01:49:51.303 --> 01:49:52.615
– Is he dead?
– I don't know!

01:49:52.639 --> 01:49:53.933
Yeah, I'm dead, yeah!

01:49:53.949 --> 01:49:55.683
Do you want me to get an ambulance?

01:49:55.809 --> 01:49:56.689
No, no no.

01:49:56.834 --> 01:49:57.721
No, no no.

01:49:57.723 --> 01:49:58.931
Look, uh...

01:49:58.948 --> 01:50:00.880
Let's just get the bed.

01:50:01.031 --> 01:50:03.310
– Come on. Come on.
– It's alright, that's alright.

01:50:03.978 --> 01:50:06.585
That's it, Charlie.
Ok, that's it, we're fucked, man.

01:50:06.616 --> 01:50:09.043
He's just fucked,
your guy is just fucked, Charlie!

01:50:09.161 --> 01:50:11.691
Alright. You just get on the front door,
make sure nobody comes in.

01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.768
Put that on your head, you...

01:50:12.783 --> 01:50:13.903
can't go, man.
– Get there, hey!

01:50:13.969 --> 01:50:14.968
What time is it?

01:50:14.969 --> 01:50:16.525
– We got 45 minutes, okay?

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:18.076
Well, how much grace you think we got?

01:50:18.132 --> 01:50:21.403
Grace? Ellen Block?
We're gonna get some fucking grace?

01:50:21.583 --> 01:50:24.408
Well, we probably got an hour before
we really gotta get him downstairs.

01:50:24.424 --> 01:50:27.200
Okay great, but let's just get a wheelchair,
and wheel his ass into the hearing.

01:50:27.201 --> 01:50:28.351
Call Harling Mays, man.

01:50:28.367 --> 01:50:29.546
Call Harling, he's got a wheelchair?

01:50:29.570 --> 01:50:31.906
He got cocaine, is it...

01:50:32.172 --> 01:50:33.425
Cocaine?

01:50:38.608 --> 01:50:39.514
Hey bro.

01:50:40.359 --> 01:50:43.138
Harling Mays. I'm on the list.

01:50:43.310 --> 01:50:44.430
Well.

01:50:45.957 --> 01:50:47.713
What's the deal, buddy?

01:50:47.839 --> 01:50:50.243
You look like you're hurt, for certain.

01:50:50.245 --> 01:50:52.845
– Thanks for com-
– Do not touch the merch, motherfucker!

01:50:57.013 --> 01:50:58.850
Take one step back, please.

01:51:01.069 --> 01:51:04.770
C-Lo, I need you outside guarding
the door please, thank you very much.

01:51:07.130 --> 01:51:08.635
It's alright. Yeah.

01:51:09.196 --> 01:51:10.289
Alright gentlemen.

01:51:10.297 --> 01:51:13.868
I need that table cleared, placed in
front of Whip, with the chair behind it.

01:51:14.536 --> 01:51:15.986
Now please!

01:51:18.473 --> 01:51:23.572
I need a glass of water, I need a credit
card, I need a hundred dollar bill.

01:51:23.866 --> 01:51:25.107
– I got a 20.

01:51:25.108 --> 01:51:26.388
– I got a 20.
– She'll do.

01:51:28.054 --> 01:51:29.996
Whip, been unable to come!?

01:51:30.067 --> 01:51:31.994
And I need a coco puff.

01:51:32.705 --> 01:51:33.749
A what?

01:51:34.749 --> 01:51:39.075
Just take the tinyest little bit of tobacco
out of the top of a cigarette, please.

01:51:39.302 --> 01:51:41.543
Damn. Amateur, man.

01:51:42.758 --> 01:51:45.169
We're almost home, okay baby.

01:51:45.762 --> 01:51:47.455
We're gonna do....

01:51:48.252 --> 01:51:50.072
two small whiffs first...

01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:54.670
One on each side.

01:51:54.822 --> 01:51:57.982
Just a little primer, to get it started.

01:51:59.800 --> 01:52:01.759
"Coco Puff".

01:52:12.868 --> 01:52:14.501
Good boy, atta boy, head back.

01:52:14.642 --> 01:52:17.171
Swallow. Water.
Water, now! Chief, you.

01:52:30.818 --> 01:52:32.979
Little coco puff, buddy.

01:52:34.274 --> 01:52:35.865
Who's the banana man?

01:52:36.061 --> 01:52:38.256
– You.
– Who's the banana man, alright.

01:52:38.468 --> 01:52:40.215
Now focus up, big dog.

01:52:46.145 --> 01:52:47.361
– There's a train coming to you.

01:52:47.362 --> 01:52:49.362
– There's a train coming to you.
– Yeah.

01:52:49.668 --> 01:52:51.384
Keep it down, big dog.

01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:54.767
Banana boat's coming.
Where's banana boat?

01:52:54.853 --> 01:52:56.162
– Banana boat is here.

01:52:56.163 --> 01:52:57.577
– Banana boat is here.
– Alright.

01:53:01.289 --> 01:53:03.185
Nothing keeps you down dog.

01:53:04.074 --> 01:53:06.247
Nothing keeps that big dog down.

01:53:09.419 --> 01:53:10.784
Guy, you're up.

01:53:12.733 --> 01:53:13.443
– Oh, uh-

01:53:13.444 --> 01:53:14.705
– Oh, uh-
– I don't, uhm...

01:53:15.463 --> 01:53:16.575
That won't do any help, thank you.

01:53:16.576 --> 01:53:18.609
That won't do any help, thank you.
– Shit, I'm taking that with you.

01:53:27.413 --> 01:53:28.678
Thank you, brother.

01:53:29.131 --> 01:53:31.050
– Shit, I'm back.
– Aha baby.

01:53:31.499 --> 01:53:33.019
– I love you.
– I love you.

01:53:40.322 --> 01:53:43.952
Alright. Which of one you gentlemen
is flowing in this enterprise?

01:53:44.612 --> 01:53:45.680
Alright.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:48.812
It's 500 bucks, I got...
you know, I got like 80 bucks on me.

01:53:49.696 --> 01:53:50.873
I just need...

01:53:50.968 --> 01:53:53.068
How much you got?
– I got it, I got it.

01:53:53.171 --> 01:53:54.731
Alright.
– Here.

01:53:54.754 --> 01:53:55.856
– Just...
– What the...

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:57.850
– You pay him.
– Pay him?

01:53:57.873 --> 01:54:00.089
Thank you.
Okay.

01:54:00.927 --> 01:54:02.666
There's a gram in here.

01:54:02.889 --> 01:54:06.441
You take it, you've paid for it,
he's gonna need it later.

01:54:07.869 --> 01:54:09.968
My work here is finished.

01:54:12.923 --> 01:54:15.383
See you all on the dark side of the moon.

01:54:15.514 --> 01:54:17.472
<i>♪Feeling alright...</i>

01:54:19.830 --> 01:54:22.158
<i>♪I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

01:54:25.986 --> 01:54:27.765
<i>♪Feeling alright...</i>

01:54:30.835 --> 01:54:33.215
<i>♪I'm not feeling that good myself...</i>

01:55:06.024 --> 01:55:07.584
I'll go ahead and tell ‘em we're here.

01:55:07.865 --> 01:55:08.764
You’re gonna make it.

01:55:08.912 --> 01:55:10.724
Remember, if they ask about your drinking,

01:55:10.732 --> 01:55:12.983
it’s totally acceptable
to say, “I don’t recall.”

01:55:13.002 --> 01:55:16.093
Hey, don't tell me how
to lie about my drinking, okay?

01:55:16.652 --> 01:55:20.300
I’m gonna lie about my drinking, I've been
lying about my drinking my whole life.

01:55:37.773 --> 01:55:39.614
Those are difficult images to watch.

01:55:39.697 --> 01:55:42.841
For the record, I'm Ellen Block,
Hearing Officer for this hearing.

01:55:42.981 --> 01:55:44.635
Captain Whitaker, good morning.

01:55:44.791 --> 01:55:46.533
Morning.
Morning.

01:55:46.749 --> 01:55:51.369
What that video captures is that the
aircraft was in a relatively stable glide

01:55:51.384 --> 01:55:53.384
just prior to the moment of impact.

01:55:53.726 --> 01:55:58.055
However, according to the data we
retreived from the cockpit data recorders,

01:55:58.208 --> 01:56:02.752
at exactly 9:34, after flying
27 minutes without incident,

01:56:02.858 --> 01:56:09.043
the transponder recorded a loss in
altitude in excess of 4800 feet per minute

01:56:09.106 --> 01:56:12.814
in what is considered a
“full pitch nose down” attitude.

01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:17.425
Then, at 9:42, according
to the data recorders,

01:56:17.550 --> 01:56:20.907
a decision was made to
invert the aircraft.

01:56:21.028 --> 01:56:25.499
The NTSB has created animated simulation
that I would like to play at this point.

01:56:26.731 --> 01:56:27.788
<i>– We gonna roll it, okay?</i>

01:56:27.789 --> 01:56:28.955
<i>– We gonna roll it, okay?
– What do you mean, roll it?</i>

01:56:28.978 --> 01:56:31.041
<i>We gotta do something to stop this dive.</i>

01:56:31.084 --> 01:56:32.940
<i>Margaret. What's your son's name?</i>

01:56:33.003 --> 01:56:34.049
<i>Trevor.</i>

01:56:34.074 --> 01:56:34.978
<i>– Say "I love you, Trevor".</i>

01:56:34.979 --> 01:56:35.579
<i>– Say "I love you, Trevor".
– What?</i>

01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:36.570
<i>– Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".</i>

01:56:36.571 --> 01:56:37.479
<i>– Black box. Say "I love you Trevor".
– "I love you Trevor".</i>

01:56:37.532 --> 01:56:39.645
<i>You be a good boy.
Mommy loves you.</i>

01:56:39.669 --> 01:56:42.417
<i>Okay, here we go. I've got control.</i>

01:56:42.448 --> 01:56:45.448
<i>Oh good Lord.
Jesus!</i>

01:56:46.427 --> 01:56:47.752
<i>– Flaps out.
– Flaps out!</i>

01:56:47.933 --> 01:56:49.823
<i>– Speed brakes.
– Speed brakes!</i>

01:56:50.677 --> 01:56:52.557
<i>Margaret.
Power!</i>

01:56:52.829 --> 01:56:54.365
<i>– Gear up.
– Gear up!</i>

01:56:54.506 --> 01:56:56.467
<i>Oh, Lord Jesus, we're inverted!</i>

01:56:56.511 --> 01:56:59.208
<i>Good flying lesson... We’re leve...
...maintain alt... like this.</i>

01:56:59.259 --> 01:57:04.170
<i>Atlan... 2-2-7... we are inverted,
I... we are... verted.</i>

01:57:04.302 --> 01:57:07.565
<i>Southj... 2... 7... did you say inverted?</i>

01:57:08.942 --> 01:57:11.885
That audio is tragic and compelling.

01:57:11.973 --> 01:57:14.089
I chose to play that part
of the cockpit recording

01:57:14.090 --> 01:57:17.844
to highlight a key moment
onboard flight 2-2-7,

01:57:17.845 --> 01:57:22.957
wherein you say “We’re gonna roll it,
here we go, I’ve got control.”

01:57:23.169 --> 01:57:26.838
You made a very conscious
decision to invert the aircraft

01:57:26.845 --> 01:57:29.818
to roll the plane upside down.
Is that correct?

01:57:32.617 --> 01:57:36.723
I'm not sure if it was
conscious, but uh...

01:57:37.327 --> 01:57:39.152
it was more like instinct.

01:57:40.100 --> 01:57:41.934
What led to that decision?

01:57:46.463 --> 01:57:47.831
I don't recall.

01:57:48.322 --> 01:57:50.226
Let me quote from an
investigative summary

01:57:50.242 --> 01:57:54.601
”From 9:34 until 9:42
the events on the aircraft are”,

01:57:54.615 --> 01:57:57.683
again I quote, “bold and remarkable”.

01:57:58.225 --> 01:58:02.016
“By inverting the plane, Captain
Whitaker arrested the descent,

01:58:02.110 --> 01:58:04.506
and allowed the aircraft to level off,

01:58:04.619 --> 01:58:08.804
enabling him to glide the aircraft
away from any populated areas,

01:58:08.858 --> 01:58:12.996
and allowing him to execute
a forced landing in an open field.

01:58:22.604 --> 01:58:24.992
I heard a loud metallic bang.

01:58:25.883 --> 01:58:27.695
We pitched nose down.

01:58:29.578 --> 01:58:30.513
No control.

01:58:30.576 --> 01:58:34.052
Yes. First Officer Evans
testimony confirms the same.

01:58:37.094 --> 01:58:38.412
I want to show you something.

01:58:43.207 --> 01:58:45.048
Nothing's happening, uh...

01:58:45.845 --> 01:58:49.312
Its remote control isn't working,
apologies, I can do this manually.

01:59:00.677 --> 01:59:04.120
This is the jackscrew on the
tail assembly that articulates

01:59:04.132 --> 01:59:07.965
the horizontal stabilizer...
also known as the elevator.

01:59:08.337 --> 01:59:12.773
As you can see, the threads on
this screw are almost entirely gone.

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:19.211
This part was suggested as a maintenance
replacement in January of 2011.

01:59:19.279 --> 01:59:20.839
It was never replaced.

01:59:21.066 --> 01:59:25.141
It had an additional 1200 hours
of flight on it. It finally failed.

01:59:25.514 --> 01:59:30.348
Our investigators have concluded
that the jackscrew snapped

01:59:30.435 --> 01:59:34.175
and the elevator was frozen
in a fixed position,

01:59:34.533 --> 01:59:39.421
locking the elevator in a down position
which forced the plane into a dive.

01:59:39.688 --> 01:59:43.560
The loss of the elevator was,
and I quote our report,

01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:47.277
“a catastrophic event, from
which recovery was improbable

01:59:47.293 --> 01:59:49.730
and stable flight, impossible.”

01:59:53.386 --> 01:59:54.506
Mr. Whitaker...

01:59:55.478 --> 02:00:00.155
I want to talk about the days leading
and the hours leading up to the accident.

02:00:00.346 --> 02:00:03.273
But before I do, I want to
remind you that you are under oath,

02:00:03.282 --> 02:00:06.781
and that any testimony you'll give here
today will be considered admissable

02:00:06.790 --> 02:00:09.514
in any subsequent hearings
or criminal proceedings.

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.834
Do you understand what that means?

02:00:13.875 --> 02:00:17.388
Captain Whitaker, for the record
I need you to verbalize your answer.

02:00:18.405 --> 02:00:20.832
Uh, I'm sorry.
Yes, I understand.

02:00:21.626 --> 02:00:25.405
On the three days leading up
to the accident: Tuesday, October 11th,

02:00:25.422 --> 02:00:28.951
Wednesday, October 12th
or Thursday, October 13th,

02:00:28.961 --> 02:00:33.211
did you consume any alcohol
or other intoxicating elements?

02:00:34.272 --> 02:00:35.636
No, I did not.

02:00:35.956 --> 02:00:39.813
On the morning of the accident,
Friday, October 14th,

02:00:39.962 --> 02:00:45.221
did you consume any alcohol,
or ingest any chemicals or drugs

02:00:45.222 --> 02:00:48.784
that may have impaired your
ability to perform your job?

02:00:49.417 --> 02:00:50.887
No, I did not.

02:00:51.964 --> 02:00:56.134
Mr. Whitaker, do you now or
have you ever had a problem

02:00:56.136 --> 02:01:00.343
with alcohol dependency,
alcoholism or drug addiction?

02:01:00.510 --> 02:01:01.680
No.

02:01:04.004 --> 02:01:06.517
Okay, Mr. Whitaker, we’re about done.

02:01:13.346 --> 02:01:18.044
Due to the severe turbulence in the
early part of the flight, you asked

02:01:18.045 --> 02:01:21.584
the flight crew to suspend the beverage
service on the plane, is that correct?

02:01:21.833 --> 02:01:25.397
Yes, that's correct, I suspended
the drink service on the plane.

02:01:25.446 --> 02:01:30.193
Are you aware that our investigators
found two single-service vodka bottles

02:01:30.194 --> 02:01:31.642
in the galley trash bin?

02:01:34.156 --> 02:01:36.083
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

02:01:36.730 --> 02:01:39.141
There were five crew members on board

02:01:39.149 --> 02:01:41.782
that who would have had access
to the beverage trolley.

02:01:42.116 --> 02:01:44.087
Less than an hour after the accident,

02:01:44.095 --> 02:01:47.176
blood was taken from each
of these crew members, yourself,

02:01:47.672 --> 02:01:52.279
first officer Evans, flight
attendant Margaret Thomason...

02:01:52.676 --> 02:01:58.072
and posthumously from Camelia
Satou, and Katerina Marquez.

02:01:59.215 --> 02:02:02.433
Toxicology analysis was performed and...

02:02:03.121 --> 02:02:05.218
three of these tests came back negative,

02:02:05.219 --> 02:02:09.286
one was disqualified for
technical reasons, and one...

02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:14.819
tested positive for alcohol.
It registered a .17 blood alcohol level.

02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:16.317
Are you aware of that?

02:02:17.337 --> 02:02:19.227
Yeah. I'm aware of it now.

02:02:25.977 --> 02:02:30.068
Miss Marquez was not only a colleague,
but you knew her outside of work,

02:02:30.076 --> 02:02:32.150
is that correct?

02:02:33.153 --> 02:02:34.833
Outside of work...

02:02:35.755 --> 02:02:37.036
No, not really.

02:02:37.148 --> 02:02:39.814
Did you know Miss Marquez
had a drinking problem?

02:02:40.917 --> 02:02:42.130
No, I did not.

02:02:42.239 --> 02:02:44.564
Did you ever see her drink to excess?

02:02:47.083 --> 02:02:48.549
No, I did not.

02:02:48.599 --> 02:02:51.503
Were you aware that she was
twice treated for alcohol addiction,

02:02:51.507 --> 02:02:55.536
the last time was 16 months ago
and paid for by SouthJet Airlines?

02:02:56.992 --> 02:02:58.392
No, I did not.

02:03:08.759 --> 02:03:15.319
Is it your opinion... that Katerina
Marquez... drank on that flight?

02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:28.725
Could you repeat the question?

02:03:29.479 --> 02:03:34.039
Is it your opinion that Katerina
Marquez drank on that flight?

02:03:46.132 --> 02:03:47.415
I’m sorry. My what?

02:03:47.548 --> 02:03:48.668
Your opinion, Captain.

02:03:48.899 --> 02:03:52.131
Since her toxicology report
is the only toxicology report

02:03:52.143 --> 02:03:56.669
that is admissable in this hearing, and
she in fact tested positive for alcohol,

02:03:56.670 --> 02:04:00.574
is it your opinion that Katerina Marquez

02:04:00.595 --> 02:04:04.299
drank those 2 bottles
of vodka on the plane?

02:04:15.850 --> 02:04:19.066
I’m sorry Mr. Whitaker, I couldn’t
hear you. What did you say?

02:04:21.878 --> 02:04:23.844
I said, "God, help me."

02:04:24.615 --> 02:04:27.464
Yes, well. However, is it your opinion-

02:04:27.475 --> 02:04:28.909
It's my opinion...

02:04:29.168 --> 02:04:30.988
Trina did not...

02:04:31.339 --> 02:04:32.891
drink that Vodka.

02:04:33.560 --> 02:04:34.813
Excuse me, Mr. Whitaker?

02:04:34.829 --> 02:04:36.399
She saved the boy’s life, that's-

02:04:36.400 --> 02:04:38.113
Could you speak louder, Captain Whitaker?

02:04:38.121 --> 02:04:40.662
Trina Marquez did not drink the vodka.

02:04:42.247 --> 02:04:44.354
Because I drank the vodka.

02:04:47.333 --> 02:04:48.510
Objection!

02:04:49.422 --> 02:04:51.338
Please be seated sir. This-

02:04:52.268 --> 02:04:53.388
Sir.

02:04:53.539 --> 02:04:54.416
– I drank the vodka bottles-

02:04:54.417 --> 02:04:56.013
– I drank the vodka bottles-
– Did you hear what I said, I object!

02:04:56.021 --> 02:04:58.544
Please be seated sir,
this is not a court room.

02:04:58.614 --> 02:05:00.064
Well, I object anyway!

02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:03.829
I drank the vodka bottles on the plane.

02:05:05.730 --> 02:05:10.377
Captain Whitaker. On the three nights
before the accident, October 11-

02:05:10.388 --> 02:05:15.479
October 11, October 12 and 13th
and 14th, I was intoxicated.

02:05:15.490 --> 02:05:18.472
I drank all of those days, I drank...

02:05:19.082 --> 02:05:20.482
in excess.

02:05:21.912 --> 02:05:24.784
– On the morning of the accident-
– I was drunk.

02:05:32.846 --> 02:05:34.297
I'm drunk now.

02:05:40.832 --> 02:05:42.557
I'm drunk right now...

02:05:43.191 --> 02:05:44.714
Miss Block...

02:05:51.621 --> 02:05:53.306
because I'm an alcoholic.

02:06:19.191 --> 02:06:20.625
That was it.

02:06:24.261 --> 02:06:25.743
I was finished.

02:06:27.703 --> 02:06:29.138
I was done.

02:06:32.130 --> 02:06:37.870
It was as if I had reached
my life long limit... for lies.

02:06:39.153 --> 02:06:42.159
I could not tell one more lie.

02:06:45.685 --> 02:06:47.409
And maybe I'm a sucker.

02:06:49.496 --> 02:06:51.946
Because if I had told just one more lie,

02:06:52.436 --> 02:06:55.001
I could have walked away
from all that mess...

02:06:55.710 --> 02:06:59.289
kept my wings, kept my
false sense of pride...

02:07:01.933 --> 02:07:06.821
and most importantly, I could have avoided
being locked up in here with all of you,

02:07:07.543 --> 02:07:10.415
nice folks for the last 13 months.

02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:15.535
But I'm here.

02:07:16.525 --> 02:07:18.525
And I'll be here for at least the...

02:07:19.205 --> 02:07:21.757
next four or five years.
And that's fair.

02:07:25.638 --> 02:07:28.542
I betrayed the public trust. I did.

02:07:28.732 --> 02:07:32.916
That’s how the judge explained it to me.
I had betrayed the public trust.

02:07:34.704 --> 02:07:37.843
The FAA, they took away
my pilot's license.

02:07:39.813 --> 02:07:41.100
And that's fair.

02:07:42.073 --> 02:07:45.664
My chances of ever flying
again are slim to none.

02:07:47.703 --> 02:07:49.349
And I accept that.

02:07:52.174 --> 02:07:55.242
I got a lot of time to think
about it, the all of it.

02:07:57.103 --> 02:07:59.119
I'm... doing some writing.

02:08:01.088 --> 02:08:05.121
I wrote letters to each of the
families that had lost loved ones, and...

02:08:08.363 --> 02:08:10.384
some of ‘em were able
to hear my apology...

02:08:12.582 --> 02:08:14.032
some of ‘em never will.

02:08:15.866 --> 02:08:18.395
I also apologized to...

02:08:19.606 --> 02:08:24.135
all the people that tried to help me...
along the way, but I...

02:08:25.814 --> 02:08:28.468
couldn't or wouldn't listen.

02:08:31.776 --> 02:08:33.664
People like my wife...

02:08:37.401 --> 02:08:39.062
My ex-wife...

02:08:43.452 --> 02:08:44.942
My son.

02:08:48.237 --> 02:08:51.345
And again like I said, you know,
some of them will...

02:08:53.758 --> 02:08:56.287
never forgive me, some of them will...

02:08:58.726 --> 02:09:00.606
But at least I'm sober.

02:09:03.224 --> 02:09:06.480
I thank God for that,
I’m grateful for that.

02:09:09.307 --> 02:09:11.211
And this is gonna sound really stupid

02:09:11.212 --> 02:09:13.843
coming from a man who’s
locked up in prison...

02:09:16.255 --> 02:09:18.393
but for the first time in my life...

02:09:19.903 --> 02:09:21.456
I’m free.

02:09:34.995 --> 02:09:37.782
Whitaker.
You got a visitor.

02:10:15.256 --> 02:10:17.587
– You have 40 minutes.
– Okay.

02:10:28.059 --> 02:10:29.858
Look at you, boy.

02:10:30.460 --> 02:10:31.666
How you doing?

02:10:31.989 --> 02:10:33.541
– Good.
– You look good.

02:10:34.847 --> 02:10:36.673
Com'on, sit down.

02:10:38.343 --> 02:10:41.299
This is a surprise.
Did you get that gift I sent you?

02:10:41.309 --> 02:10:41.970
– Yeah.
– Yeah?

02:10:41.986 --> 02:10:43.259
– Yeah, I got it.
– You like it?

02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:44.380
– Yeah.
– Good...

02:10:46.829 --> 02:10:49.945
– How's your mom?
– Fine. She's alright.

02:10:51.711 --> 02:10:55.576
My College counselor wanted
me to come in... interview you.

02:10:56.631 --> 02:10:57.646
Me?

02:10:57.832 --> 02:11:01.142
Yeah. I'm writing essays
for College applications.

02:11:01.205 --> 02:11:02.325
Good.

02:11:02.651 --> 02:11:04.117
I need your help.

02:11:04.430 --> 02:11:05.830
So you got it.

02:11:07.076 --> 02:11:11.919
And then... this essay.
The essay that I have to write...

02:11:13.721 --> 02:11:20.156
it's called... “the most fascinating
person... that I’ve never met.”

02:11:30.927 --> 02:11:32.605
So...

02:11:37.169 --> 02:11:38.636
Who are you?

02:11:47.743 --> 02:11:49.280
That's a good question.

02:11:54.353 --> 02:11:59.623
