late doing some repairs.

the tarp would have been on.

but I just--
I keep ending up with these--

42:23.133 --> 42:25.400
These losers and creeps

42:26.567 --> 42:28.167
and I don't want that.

42:28.167 --> 42:32.067
I don't want to be the kind
of person that wants that.

42:35.067 --> 42:38.701
I just--
I don't know why I can't--

42:41.601 --> 42:44.400
Why I just can't find someone
like you.

42:48.033 --> 42:50.868
I just want someone like you.

43:00.234 --> 43:02.133
MAN [ON TV]:
 <i>You all got families at home.</i>

43:02.133 --> 43:04.367
 <i>Wives, mothers,</i>
 <i>and sweethearts.</i>

43:04.367 --> 43:07.234
 <i>And I ain't got no one</i>
 <i>so it doesn't matter about me.</i>

43:10.000 --> 43:12.167
[***]

43:13.305 --> 43:19.636
