WEBVTT

00:05.706 --> 00:08.209
Abishola needs
fuel for the day,

00:08.309 --> 00:10.111
not diabetes.

00:10.211 --> 00:11.412
She's taking the MCAT,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.947
so I'm making her
a cat face pancake.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.849
It looks like an elephant.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.451
That's not a trunk,
that's his tongue.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.452
You want one?

00:18.552 --> 00:19.753
Sugar reduces production

00:19.853 --> 00:22.056
of the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor.

00:22.156 --> 00:23.624
So, no?

00:25.693 --> 00:28.529
You do not care about my
daughter's neurotrophic factor?

00:28.629 --> 00:30.598
I'm just having a little fun.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.833
I see now that was a mistake.

00:34.001 --> 00:35.103
Good morning.

00:35.203 --> 00:37.004
There she is.
Good morning.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.272
Mwah.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.174
Have a seat, future doctor.

00:40.274 --> 00:42.676
We made you breakfast.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.145
It's more like dessert. Hey.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.213
Sorry.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.947
You did not have to do this.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.282
How you feeling? Nervous?

00:48.382 --> 00:50.218
Ah, it should be
nothing for Abishola.

00:50.318 --> 00:52.986
Every half-witted physician
has passed that test.

00:53.087 --> 00:56.190
But we will love you
no matter what happens.

00:56.290 --> 00:58.259
I do not share that sentiment.

00:58.359 --> 01:00.294
I'm not taking the test today.

01:00.394 --> 01:01.529
Oh, no, honey, it's today.

01:01.629 --> 01:03.164
I put it in my calendar.
"Abi MCAT.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.465
"Make pancakes.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.100
Keep mouth shut.
Keep Ebun's mouth shut."

01:06.200 --> 01:07.868
Eh-eh.
Sorry.

01:07.968 --> 01:09.903
I postponed my test.
What?

01:10.003 --> 01:11.038
Are you dying?
No.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.173
Is Bob dying?

01:12.273 --> 01:13.407
No.
Dele,

01:13.507 --> 01:14.642
are you dying?
I don't think so.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.544
There, no one is dying.

01:16.644 --> 01:20.214
But if you do not take
the test, it will kill me.

01:20.314 --> 01:22.383
It is not the right time.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.818
The right time
was 15 years ago.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.420
It would be better if we wait

01:26.520 --> 01:28.556
until Bob's factory
is fully operational.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.458
The factory's
gonna be fine.

01:30.558 --> 01:33.494
And if not,
we need you to be a doctor.

01:33.594 --> 01:35.129
Can we talk about this later?

01:35.229 --> 01:37.030
Well, at least eat something.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.300
Sugar reduces the production
of the...

01:39.400 --> 01:40.701
You know what?

02:10.030 --> 02:11.399
Hello, Christina.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.667
Oh, hey, Kofo.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.702
What are you doing?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.270
Oh, I'm done dusting,

02:16.370 --> 02:18.005
so I thought I'd start doodling.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.574
You doodled
a marketing campaign?

02:20.674 --> 02:23.811
It's a plan to get more
children into our socks.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.179
We hook them when they're young

02:25.279 --> 02:27.615
and then they become
lifelong customers.

02:27.715 --> 02:29.383
Like a cigarette company.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.652
Goodwin will love it. Oh.

02:31.752 --> 02:35.223
I hope so. I never updated
my LinkedIn to janitor

02:35.323 --> 02:37.958
and I'm starting
to feel like a liar.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.794
Have faith. Things
worked out for me.

02:40.894 --> 02:45.065
Oh, it was awesome to watch
you get promoted over Goodwin.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.236
I will admit,
it was a baller move.

02:49.136 --> 02:51.972
It's too bad he got promoted
over you again.

02:52.072 --> 02:54.742
Yes, it is unfortunate.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.144
You know, sometimes I
sit in Goodwin's chair

02:57.245 --> 02:59.547
and pretend that
I became president. Hm.

03:00.348 --> 03:01.549
I bet you'd make
a wonderful boss.

03:01.649 --> 03:04.985
No, even in my fantasies
I'm a pushover.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.820
Morning, everyone.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.256
Good morning.
Good morning, boss.

03:08.356 --> 03:11.959
Let's get to it. Douglas,
what is on the agenda?

03:12.059 --> 03:13.427
Marketing ideas.

03:13.527 --> 03:18.065
Oh, well, then I guess
you'll need the board.

03:18.165 --> 03:19.300
Thank you, Christina.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.502
Douglas, please
erase those doodles.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.003
On it.

03:23.103 --> 03:24.805
Wh...
I'll give you a tip.

03:24.905 --> 03:28.075
If you want to impress Goodwin,
he loves a clean board.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.345
A little help?

03:48.161 --> 03:49.096
What?

03:49.196 --> 03:50.331
You know what.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.799
You should be on the second hour

03:51.899 --> 03:55.235
of the MCAT with a cramped
hand and a full bladder.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.737
It is not a good time.

03:56.837 --> 03:58.472
Well, I cannot wait much longer.

03:58.572 --> 04:02.075
I already have family members
counting on your prescriptions.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.677
Why would you make
these promises?

04:03.777 --> 04:07.781
Because I had no idea
you'd become a lazy failure.

04:07.881 --> 04:09.750
I am doing what is best
for my family.

04:10.984 --> 04:12.085
I have known you 20 years.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.354
How long have you known Bob?

04:13.454 --> 04:15.956
He's practically a stranger.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.091
Honey, you have a chance
I never got.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.860
Don't waste it.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.228
We need more women doctors.

04:21.329 --> 04:23.431
Hell, we need more
Black doctors.

04:23.531 --> 04:26.066
And look at you,
you can be both.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.135
I do not need you telling me
what to do.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.803
This is my life

04:29.903 --> 04:31.505
and my decision.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.178
She's not even storming off.

04:38.278 --> 04:41.114
Just like I said. Lazy.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.320
Well, maybe it's good.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.588
Now that she's not
studying all the time,

04:47.688 --> 04:48.822
she can do more
things she likes.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.258
What is it she likes to do?

04:53.260 --> 04:54.762
Study.

04:56.263 --> 04:57.898
It is obvious
what is happening here.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.266
What?

04:59.367 --> 05:00.534
I've seen it many times
over the years.

05:00.634 --> 05:01.569
Seen what?

05:01.669 --> 05:02.870
Especially with Nigerian women.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.105
Tell me what it is.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.740
Abishola has given up
her life's dream

05:06.840 --> 05:08.442
to help you achieve yours.

05:08.542 --> 05:12.012
There's no way she's giving up
prescribing compression socks

05:12.112 --> 05:14.181
to watch me make them.

05:14.281 --> 05:18.251
My mother stayed home so
my father could be a doctor.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.854
My auntie did the
same thing with my uncle.

05:20.954 --> 05:23.991
She even supported him
when he gave up his law practice

05:24.091 --> 05:25.893
to become a magician.

05:26.794 --> 05:29.730
He calls himself
the Amazing Chinedu.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.265
He is anything but.

05:32.366 --> 05:34.402
Well, I'm not
the Great Bob-dini,

05:34.502 --> 05:37.705
but Abishola's dreams
are just as important as mine.

05:37.805 --> 05:39.673
Well, that must be why
we are in a factory

05:39.773 --> 05:41.108
that she did not want.

05:41.208 --> 05:43.143
I did this for the both of us.

05:43.243 --> 05:45.713
That is what my uncle
tells my aunt

05:45.813 --> 05:47.981
every night
before she climbs in a box

05:48.081 --> 05:50.584
and he cuts her in half.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.758
Christina, come in.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.293
Uh, before you say anything,

06:00.394 --> 06:02.763
the humane ant traps
are working

06:02.863 --> 06:06.266
and I plan on releasing
the colony into the wild.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.635
I do not care.

06:07.735 --> 06:10.804
Sit, I want your opinion
on a marketing strategy.

06:10.904 --> 06:14.742
Oh, my God, you do see me.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.112
I'm considering a
new sock promotion:

06:19.212 --> 06:20.414
"Find A Foot."

06:20.514 --> 06:22.450
People send in
pictures of feet

06:22.550 --> 06:24.485
for a free pair of socks.

06:25.352 --> 06:27.054
Whose feet?

06:27.154 --> 06:28.489
Any foot will do.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.724
A foot on the beach.
A foot in a taxi.

06:30.824 --> 06:31.892
A foot in the spa.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.629
This seems less like
a marketing campaign

06:35.729 --> 06:39.299
and more like a pending lawsuit.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.934
Very well.

06:41.034 --> 06:43.904
I will tell Kofo that his
perverted idea is terrible.

06:44.004 --> 06:48.141
Oh, uh, yeah, I-I didn't
realize it was Kofo's idea.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.143
You know, it might work.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.813
Even perverts need to buy socks.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.450
I have been unsatisfied
with Kofo's performance.

06:56.550 --> 06:58.351
Come up with an
alternative campaign,

06:58.452 --> 07:00.688
and I will consider
promoting you.

07:00.788 --> 07:03.356
Wow, thank you.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.292
I-I won't let you down.

07:07.928 --> 07:11.732
So, if-if I move up,
what-what happens to Kofo?

07:12.566 --> 07:16.269
Do not worry.
He will be taken care of.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.611
You don't mean "taken care
of" in a good way, do you?

07:24.945 --> 07:27.581
No. I didn't think so.

07:33.821 --> 07:37.290
Dottie, I'm looking
for private nursing work.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.626
Do you know anyone
who may need help?

07:38.726 --> 07:40.494
Oh, let me check
my Facebook.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.362
You want bedridden
or wanders out of the house

07:42.462 --> 07:44.164
in their underwear?

07:44.264 --> 07:45.165
Who's in their underwear?

07:45.265 --> 07:46.466
Your mother's friends.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.835
She's helping me find
at-home patients.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.870
Mom, keep your dying friends
to yourself.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.171
You sure?

07:51.271 --> 07:53.040
Right off the bat,
I got two broken hips

07:53.140 --> 07:54.608
and a botched face-lift.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.910
I'm not losing you
to the Stepford Grannies.

07:57.010 --> 07:59.046
We're signing you up
for the MCAT.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.447
I do not need you to do that.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.482
You can't be a doctor
without taking the test.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.384
Eh, here's one
in a couple of weeks.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.286
Three spaces left.
Bob, stop.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.821
I can't live with myself knowing

08:07.921 --> 08:09.957
you gave up your dreams
for mine.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.291
That is not what I am doing.

08:11.391 --> 08:13.326
Good to know.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.563
So, what are you doing?

08:15.663 --> 08:16.564
Nothing.

08:16.664 --> 08:17.898
Come on, this isn't like you.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.067
I'm not dropping this,
level with me.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.803
I'm not sure if I want
to be a doctor anymore.

08:23.704 --> 08:27.140
Okay, I hear your words, but
they're not making any sense.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.576
I know.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.712
So, what's changed?
I don't know.

08:31.812 --> 08:33.380
Come here.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.586
It's okay.

08:41.254 --> 08:43.957
Agnes Snyder. Osteoporosis.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.093
She's got bones
like a cooked chicken.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.303
Have you seen my work ID?

08:56.403 --> 08:58.038
You're going to work?

08:58.138 --> 09:00.073
It's Monday.
What else would I be doing?

09:00.173 --> 09:02.175
You made a pretty big
declaration last night.

09:02.275 --> 09:03.977
I think you should
take the day off.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.979
And I think you should stop
talking nonsense

09:06.079 --> 09:08.281
and help me find my ID.
Come on.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.050
Don't you guys get
mental health days?

09:10.150 --> 09:12.452
Yes, and I laugh at the people
who take them.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.988
Where is it?

09:15.088 --> 09:18.325
Bob, can you please keep
your shoes in the closet?

09:18.425 --> 09:20.227
Those are actually slippers.
They're meant to look like...

09:20.327 --> 09:21.494
I do not care what they are.

09:21.595 --> 09:22.495
Okay.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.032
I had it yesterday.

09:26.133 --> 09:27.935
Did you touch it?

09:28.035 --> 09:29.202
Oh, yeah. I like to set up

09:29.302 --> 09:31.271
little morning
scavenger hunts for you.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.473
This is not the time
for your silly jokes.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.775
Abishola.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.543
No more talking
until we find my ID.

09:36.644 --> 09:37.978
Abishola.
Shh.

09:38.078 --> 09:38.979
I know it is close.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.882
Abishola!
What?

09:44.918 --> 09:46.453
Oh.

09:47.420 --> 09:50.390
Now get my phone. Yeah.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.561
Cardiology,
how can I help you?

09:54.662 --> 09:55.963
Hey, Abishola.

09:56.063 --> 09:58.131
Uh-huh.

09:58.231 --> 10:00.467
Oh, so it's like
a mental health day.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.404
Okay, I didn't mean
any offense by it.

10:04.504 --> 10:06.073
We'll see you tomorrow.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.508
A mental health day.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.710
My God.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.179
I will alert
her loved ones.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.417
Where's Abishola?

10:17.517 --> 10:18.385
I don't know.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.920
What kind of
useless husband

10:20.020 --> 10:21.955
does not keep track
of his wife?

10:22.055 --> 10:23.991
One that knows when
his wife needs space.

10:24.091 --> 10:27.627
What kind of useless
husband gives his wife space?

10:28.829 --> 10:30.864
I'm worried about my daughter.

10:30.964 --> 10:32.265
Me, too.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.201
It is not like her
to give up on something

10:34.301 --> 10:36.937
she has worked so hard on
for so long.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.538
I know.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.607
I tried to talk to her,
I'm not sure what else to do.

10:40.708 --> 10:43.276
Sometimes a child
just needs her mother.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.679
I want to be
there for her.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.916
To hold her hand,
pull her close

10:49.016 --> 10:51.919
and tell her
she is being an idiot!

10:52.820 --> 10:54.587
Wow. You almost had me.

10:54.688 --> 10:57.825
<i>E kaale.</i>
Oh, my poor,
sweet grandson.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.860
Do you know where
we can find your mother?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.429
Dele, it's a trap.
Go to your room.

11:15.075 --> 11:16.309
Hello?

11:16.409 --> 11:18.578
Hey, Abishola.
Are you free right now?

11:19.379 --> 11:21.715
I don' think
I've ever truly been free.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.585
Okay, great.
So, I have an opportunity.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.956
I can climb the corporate
ladder, but to do it,

11:29.056 --> 11:32.425
I have to step on Kofo's
cute little fingers.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.862
Who cares?

11:34.962 --> 11:38.231
So, I should just
keep climbing up

11:38.331 --> 11:39.967
and ignore his screams?

11:40.067 --> 11:41.769
What do I know?

11:41.869 --> 11:43.837
I'm taking a mental health day.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.908
Yeah, right.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.877
Can you imagine?

11:49.977 --> 11:52.645
Oh, God,
you'd want to die.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.350
Oh. I see what you're doing.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.919
Do you?

11:59.019 --> 12:00.287
Please, tell me.

12:00.387 --> 12:03.690
You aren't gonna provide me
with the answers

12:03.791 --> 12:07.460
'cause it's time I start
providing them for myself.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.030
Thanks, girlie.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.499
I'm gonna let you
get back to work.

12:12.599 --> 12:13.767
Oh, well, sorry.

12:13.867 --> 12:16.236
"Mental health day."

12:25.813 --> 12:28.081
Wait, is that goalie's name
Bob Wheeler?

12:28.181 --> 12:31.518
I name the players in my soccer
game after my family members.

12:31.618 --> 12:34.121
Ah, they just
scored on me. Yes.

12:34.221 --> 12:35.989
You're quite slow.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.559
How come I can't be
the guy that scored?

12:39.659 --> 12:43.196
That was Auntie Olu.
She's amazing.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.133
So, how you doing?

12:46.233 --> 12:47.734
You know,
in the real world.

12:47.835 --> 12:49.536
I'm fine.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.839
You don't have to pretend.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.106
I mean, your mom is going
through something right now

12:53.206 --> 12:54.942
and we're all a little worried.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.209
She'll be fine.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.744
She always
figures it out.

12:57.845 --> 13:00.013
That's why I made her the coach.

13:00.814 --> 13:03.383
It's natural to be freaked out.
Uh-huh.

13:03.483 --> 13:04.484
Especially if you feel like
you're not allowed

13:04.584 --> 13:06.253
to be part of the solution.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.956
Uh-huh?

13:09.056 --> 13:11.624
And you don't want to overstep,
but you want to be supportive.

13:11.724 --> 13:14.761
I'm her husband, she should be
sharing these things with me.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.932
And instead, you're here
sharing them with me.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.670
Oh, look,
I blocked a goal.

13:23.770 --> 13:24.804
That wasn't you.

13:24.905 --> 13:26.039
You got subbed
out for Auntie Kemi.

13:26.139 --> 13:28.241
She's amazing.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.684
Abishola?

13:37.784 --> 13:39.819
Ah. Auntie, Uncle.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.254
How did you find me?

13:41.354 --> 13:44.624
Nothing calms your worried
mind like tumbling linens.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.494
We always knew when
you were struggling because

13:47.594 --> 13:49.562
all the comforters
would be missing.

13:51.098 --> 13:52.599
Kemi told us about
your mental day.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.668
Ah. Lower your voice.

13:56.436 --> 13:59.439
I used to always be thinking
about what was next.

13:59.539 --> 14:01.641
What I had to do,
who I had to be.

14:01.741 --> 14:06.713
But lately, my mind
has been... quiet.

14:06.813 --> 14:07.680
Quiet?

14:07.780 --> 14:10.417
When I am at home with Bob,

14:10.517 --> 14:13.954
I have this strange
and unnatural feeling

14:14.054 --> 14:16.189
that everything is okay.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.425
What is wrong with me?

14:18.525 --> 14:21.861
This will come as a shock,
but I believe you are happy.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.431
Oh. That is ridiculous.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.799
We are as surprised as you are.

14:26.900 --> 14:30.303
I have sabotaged my own career
and I don't even care.

14:30.403 --> 14:33.106
The-the symptoms
sneak up on you.

14:33.206 --> 14:35.508
It happened to me
the day I met Olu.

14:35.608 --> 14:39.512
I was in the library
studying for my chemistry exam

14:39.612 --> 14:42.615
and I heard the giggle
of an angel.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.251
I was the angel.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.956
That sweet sound
led me to my soulmate.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.257
I was the soulmate.

14:50.357 --> 14:52.225
And from that moment on,

14:52.325 --> 14:55.795
I did not care what I got
on that chemistry exam.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.931
I wanted to hear that laugh.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.500
Oh, Tunde.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.271
It never gets old.

15:04.371 --> 15:05.872
So what do I do now?

15:05.973 --> 15:07.407
Enjoy yourself.

15:07.507 --> 15:09.342
But hide it from others.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.312
Most people find
happiness irritating.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.352
Hey, Kofo, you busy?

15:19.452 --> 15:22.956
Just deleting pictures of feet
from my laptop.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.092
I'm giving you a heads-up.

15:25.192 --> 15:28.595
Goodwin asked me to present
my own marketing campaign.

15:28.695 --> 15:30.397
Oh.

15:30.497 --> 15:32.465
I didn't want to do it
without telling you.

15:32.565 --> 15:34.234
I want you to know...

15:34.334 --> 15:37.637
your fingers matter to me.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.973
Thank you?

15:40.073 --> 15:42.242
I'm so sorry, Kofo.

15:42.342 --> 15:43.910
Do not be.

15:44.011 --> 15:45.078
You deserve the opportunity.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.613
But you should know,

15:46.713 --> 15:49.216
I will not be giving up
without a fight.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.817
Oh, of course.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.652
May the best
marketing executive win.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.055
I will even wish you
good luck.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.356
That is how confident I am.

15:56.456 --> 15:57.624
I'm not afraid either.

15:57.724 --> 15:59.459
I hope you knock 'em dead.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.928
I am going to,
right in front of you.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.396
Bring it on.

16:03.496 --> 16:05.765
Then you can watch me
hit it out of the park.

16:05.865 --> 16:11.238
Yes, we will both be watching
each other hitting it hard.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.507
I'll hit it harder.

16:14.607 --> 16:17.210
I will also
be hitting it harder.

16:17.310 --> 16:18.978
Hm. Will you now?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.149
Yes, I will.

16:22.249 --> 16:24.351
We'll see.

16:24.451 --> 16:26.319
Won't we?

16:26.419 --> 16:28.621
Oh, my.

16:34.227 --> 16:35.562
If you're gonna be
in here for a while,

16:35.662 --> 16:38.865
I'd turn the lamp off
so your mom doesn't find you.

16:38.965 --> 16:40.767
Hmm. Good to know.

16:42.302 --> 16:44.371
I had a very
nice conversation

16:44.471 --> 16:45.638
with Auntie
and Uncle today.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.107
Ah, they're the best.
Mm-hmm.

16:47.207 --> 16:50.009
They helped me see that
the crisis I'm having

16:50.110 --> 16:52.112
is all your fault.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.413
Well, why do they
get the credit?

16:53.513 --> 16:54.747
I knew it was me yesterday.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.585
The problem is that
you make me happy.

16:58.685 --> 17:01.588
I'm sorry,
that was never my intention.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.590
Happy people are lazy.

17:03.690 --> 17:04.957
They lose their ambition

17:05.058 --> 17:06.593
and lie around eating
salami and cheese

17:06.693 --> 17:08.095
with their husband.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.498
I thought you loved
charcuterie Tuesday.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.634
I do. And the wine pairings.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.270
And the way we snuggle
during movie marathons.

17:17.370 --> 17:18.938
That is the problem.

17:19.038 --> 17:22.142
You have loved me
into complacency.

17:22.942 --> 17:26.346
So you're not a doctor
because I'm a great husband?

17:26.446 --> 17:29.616
Exactly. I will not
let you get in my way.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.219
This is where I'll
be every day after work

17:32.319 --> 17:33.986
until I accomplish my goals.

17:34.087 --> 17:35.722
Okay.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.490
Why are you smiling?

17:37.590 --> 17:39.559
Right, sorry, no happiness.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.728
Now kiss me and get out.

17:43.696 --> 17:45.298
Can I at least
bring you some snacks?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.867
Stop making things nice.
All right.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.304
It's kind of
chilly in here,

17:51.404 --> 17:52.872
but I'm not gonna
turn on the heat.

17:52.972 --> 17:54.040
Thank you.

17:54.141 --> 17:55.708
And I won't bring you a blanket.

17:55.808 --> 17:58.445
Enough flutzing,
I'm trying to study.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.347
All right.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.697
Hello.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.865
Hello.

18:18.965 --> 18:22.169
I am Babatunde
Temitope Olatunji.

18:22.269 --> 18:25.638
But you may call me Tunde.

18:25.738 --> 18:28.040
Hi. I am Olu.

18:28.141 --> 18:30.677
You may call me Olu.

18:30.777 --> 18:31.878
I love your laugh.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.213
I love your hair.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.382
It is my best asset.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.185
Sister.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.887
What are you doing talking
to this ragamuffin?

18:40.987 --> 18:42.489
We are here to study.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.257
Yes, Ebun.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.563
I will meet you by the
periodicals tomorrow.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.731
Yes, I will be there.

18:51.831 --> 18:52.765
So will I.

18:52.865 --> 18:53.966
With bated breath.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.602
I cannot wait.
Olu!

18:55.702 --> 18:56.836
Ooh.
