01:04.567 --> 01:06.033
Discard already! I'm 80.

01:06.100 --> 01:08.433
I'd to live long enough
to see the next hand.

01:09.233 --> 01:11.967
No need to, ma. Gin.

01:12.033 --> 01:13.600
Oh! You're taking advantage.

01:13.667 --> 01:15.834
You know I'm whacked out
on blood pressure medicine.

01:16.533 --> 01:19.367
Honey, if the medicine bothers you,
change the prescription.

01:19.433 --> 01:21.066
I like being whacked out.

01:21.734 --> 01:23.333
Oh, I'm so glad you're here!

01:23.400 --> 01:25.467
My date's brother just came into town

01:25.533 --> 01:27.767
and unless I can find a date
for him so we can double,

01:27.834 --> 01:29.600
well, the whole evening's
gonna be called off.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.166
So, what do you say?
Would you please, please be a friend

01:32.233 --> 01:34.166
-and go out with him?
-Sure, I'm game.

01:36.967 --> 01:39.300
Next time, Sophie.
Dorothy, what do you say?

01:39.367 --> 01:42.734
Oh, honey, I'd really love to go,
but as you can see, I'm busy.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.433
Busy? You're playing cards!

01:44.500 --> 01:48.000
We are not playing cards,
we are playing gin rummy.

01:48.066 --> 01:50.400
And she stinks at it.
We've been doing it for 30 years,

01:50.467 --> 01:51.600
she hasn't beaten me once.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.300
Tonight's going to be different.

01:53.367 --> 01:56.967
Tonight, the 30 years
of humiliation ends.

01:57.033 --> 01:59.900
Ooh, I'm so scared,
my dentures are chattering.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.633
-Hi.
-Oh, Rose, honey...

02:03.700 --> 02:07.433
are you up for a night on the town
with two handsome, eligible bachelors?

02:07.500 --> 02:09.700
Oh, thanks for asking,
but I don't think so.

02:09.767 --> 02:12.000
I'm not that interested
in dating anymore.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.066
Now, you know that's not true, honey,
or you'd let your hair go natural.

02:18.600 --> 02:21.300
You know what my problem really is?
I'm spoiled.

02:21.367 --> 02:24.700
I had a long and wonderful marriage
with the perfect man.

02:24.767 --> 02:27.133
Everyone seems so ordinary after Charlie.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.967
Honey, it's just for dinner,
and Charles would want you to eat.

02:32.800 --> 02:36.233
Oh, Rose, be a friend.
If you don't go, I can't go.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.500
I know I'm gonna regret this

02:38.567 --> 02:41.000
and I know I'm gonna
have a miserable time, but I'll go.

02:41.066 --> 02:43.166
Aw, that's the spirit!
I'll go call the boys.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.200
Rose, why do you look so depressed?

02:49.266 --> 02:52.100
I'm tired of going out
and not enjoying myself!

02:52.700 --> 02:54.834
All the men I meet act so old.

02:54.900 --> 02:56.934
Last week, I went out with this man

02:57.000 --> 03:00.100
that talked for two hours
about his prostate problems.

03:01.900 --> 03:06.033
I lived in Minnesota for 51 years,
I never even heard of a prostate!

03:06.900 --> 03:09.000
Honey, they don't have them there.
It's too cold.

03:10.934 --> 03:14.266
Dorothy, you should be going on this date.
At least you'd have some fun.

03:14.333 --> 03:18.333
Nothing could be more fun than
beating my mother at cards tonight.

03:18.967 --> 03:21.200
-What's the name of the game?
-Gin.

03:30.066 --> 03:32.500
-(Sophia) Gin.
-(glass breaking)

03:36.734 --> 03:39.867
Dorothy? What's the matter?
Something wrong?

03:39.934 --> 03:42.033
The thrill of victory!

03:43.266 --> 03:44.967
The agony of defeat!

03:47.867 --> 03:49.867
I don't know why you play cards
with your mother.

03:49.934 --> 03:52.266
-It just makes you crazy.
-You're absolutely right, Blanche.

03:52.333 --> 03:54.000
This has gone on far too long.

03:54.066 --> 03:56.700
Mom, I am not playing gin
with you anymore!

03:56.767 --> 03:59.333
You'll be back. You know why?
You're too competitive!

03:59.400 --> 04:01.233
It's always been your worst feature.

04:02.533 --> 04:04.934
Actually, your ears are your worst
feature.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.300
But competitive is right up there.

04:09.033 --> 04:10.867
-Do you believe that?
-No.

04:10.934 --> 04:13.867
I always thought your bony feet
were your worst feature.

04:15.233 --> 04:16.600
-Nighty-night.
-Wait! Wait a minute!

04:16.667 --> 04:19.000
Wait a minute. You haven't told me
about the double date.

04:19.066 --> 04:20.600
It was a complete disaster.

04:20.667 --> 04:22.900
Oh, you mean Rose and her guy
didn't hit it off?

04:22.967 --> 04:24.934
Oh, no, they got along
just great.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.567
It was my escort
who turned out to be the dud.

04:28.867 --> 04:31.967
Next time, I'm gonna date both brothers
before I give one away.

04:33.867 --> 04:37.300
-Hi.
-Hi. I hear you had a great time tonight.

04:37.367 --> 04:38.800
It was the best!

04:39.400 --> 04:42.967
I haven't laughed so much or acted
so silly since I was a teenager.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.400
-You know what we did?
-What?

04:44.467 --> 04:46.900
-We ran a tollbooth!
-Oh...

04:48.066 --> 04:50.800
Arnie said he just did it
because it was there.

04:53.967 --> 04:58.133
Oh, he is the most outrageous,
unpredictable man I've ever met.

04:58.200 --> 05:00.066
Jeffrey's on a low-sodium diet.

05:04.867 --> 05:07.834
I can't remember
when I had so much fun.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.667
We went dancing at the beachcomber.

05:09.734 --> 05:11.633
We're gonna go back again tomorrow night.

05:11.700 --> 05:14.567
Jeffrey doesn't dance.
He says it makes his ankles swell.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.133
Honey, I think it's terrific
you had a good time tonight.

05:19.200 --> 05:22.367
I have you two to thank for it.
Good night.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.233
-Good night.
-(mocks) Night. (raspberry)

05:25.700 --> 05:29.533
Blanche, come on now! Be happy for her.
She finally met someone.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.867
I mean, you go out with lots
of interesting guys!

05:31.934 --> 05:33.133
Name one.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.867
How about that coach
from the Miami dolphins?

05:35.934 --> 05:39.500
Oh, yeah. That night was kind of fun.

05:40.033 --> 05:42.900
The training room, the whirlpool...

05:43.600 --> 05:44.767
the adhesive tape...

05:46.400 --> 05:47.800
ooh, name another one.

05:48.767 --> 05:51.667
Honey, take a cold shower
and go to bed.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.633
Oh, Dorothy, would you please open this
jar of macadamia nuts for me?

06:02.967 --> 06:04.800
-You can't get it open?
-Oh, I didn't try.

06:04.867 --> 06:06.467
I don't want to risk cracking a nail.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.066
What are these, claws?

06:10.700 --> 06:12.133
Well, I figured you wouldn't mind,

06:12.200 --> 06:14.467
seeing as how you work
with your hands all day.

06:14.533 --> 06:18.100
I'm a teacher, I grade papers.
I don't shuck oysters.

06:19.400 --> 06:21.900
-Thank you.
-I'm going next door to Frieda Goodson's,

06:21.967 --> 06:24.967
-we're having a club meeting.
-I didn't know you were in a club.

06:25.033 --> 06:27.233
Yeah, a bunch of us get together
and send our pictures in

06:27.300 --> 06:29.633
to Willard Scott with a note
saying we're 100.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.667
Ma, that's ridiculous!

06:34.734 --> 06:36.867
You got a better way to get on
<i>The Today Show?</i>

06:39.934 --> 06:43.367
Will you take it inside, Rose?
This isn't the French quarter.

06:45.767 --> 06:48.900
-You'll think about next week, Rose?
-I will, Arnie.

06:49.400 --> 06:50.533
Talk to you soon.

06:53.567 --> 06:57.533
Well, it looks like you and Arnie
are getting pretty serious.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.500
-Honey, are you all right?
-I'll be fine.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.667
-Is this about Arnie?
-No, Blanche. She's upset

07:20.734 --> 07:23.266
because they keep changing
the taste of coke.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.900
Arnie wants me to go away with him
on a cruise to The Bahamas.

07:34.633 --> 07:39.333
Oh. Oh, and you're upset because
he wants you to pay your own way?

07:42.200 --> 07:47.100
I'm upset because we'll be all alone,
in the middle of the ocean, on a ship,

07:47.166 --> 07:50.000
in a state room, with a bed.

07:51.834 --> 07:52.934
Oh.

07:53.500 --> 07:54.734
I don't know what to do.

07:55.834 --> 07:56.867
I haven't...

07:57.900 --> 07:59.367
been with a man...

08:00.000 --> 08:04.467
-in that special way since Charlie died.
-Get out of here.

08:07.900 --> 08:11.500
It's true.
Charlie was the only lover I ever had.

08:11.567 --> 08:13.900
And my first time
was on our wedding night.

08:14.400 --> 08:16.300
Get out of here.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.867
Oh, back off, Blanche!

08:18.934 --> 08:22.200
Not all of us are classified by the Navy
as a friendly port.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.600
Maybe it sounds strange, but...

08:29.433 --> 08:32.333
without Charlie, I thought that part
of my life was over.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.033
-I never gave it a second thought.
-Until now?

08:36.567 --> 08:38.333
Then I think you should
go on the cruise.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.934
Honey, if the situation is right,
you'll know it.

08:41.700 --> 08:42.800
But I'm not sure I'm ready.

08:42.867 --> 08:45.567
Oh, honey, I know what
you're going through.

08:45.633 --> 08:48.533
The bottom line is,
if you take a chance in life,

08:48.600 --> 08:51.667
sometimes good things happen,
sometimes bad things happen.

08:51.734 --> 08:54.300
But, honey, if you don't take a chance,
nothing happens.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.600
I'm gonna take a chance.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.367
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Oh, great, Rose!

09:01.433 --> 09:02.633
Oh, I have to look in my closet.

09:02.700 --> 09:05.400
I don't even know what to wear
the first night on the ship.

09:05.467 --> 09:07.800
A life jacket and a great big smile.

09:50.367 --> 09:52.700
-You startled me.
-Oh, I'm sorry.

09:52.767 --> 09:54.767
Next time, I'll... I'll knock.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.400
I like your bathrobe.

09:58.467 --> 10:00.900
Yeah. Kids gave it to me
for Father's Day.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.433
I wish I had that knack.
Picking out unusual gifts.

10:08.433 --> 10:13.066
-Is it, um... is it terry cloth?
-Yeah, I think it is.

10:13.700 --> 10:17.600
Terry cloth wears a long time.
It's a nice fabric.

10:17.667 --> 10:21.133
-Yes, perfect for a robe.
-Mm.

10:22.533 --> 10:25.600
Well, I guess it's time to turn in.

10:26.100 --> 10:27.100
I guess.

10:29.867 --> 10:32.166
Uh, you're not tired?

10:32.233 --> 10:33.934
-Not really.
-Me, neither.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.433
Do you feel like dancing?

10:37.600 --> 10:39.633
Oh, I'd love to.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.400
I can be dressed and back in that ballroom
in ten minutes!

10:42.467 --> 10:45.066
No, no, Rose! We don't
have to go through all that trouble.

10:45.133 --> 10:49.800
See, I bought this for my grandson,
sounded so good, I kept it for myself.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.133
(jazz music playing)

10:55.200 --> 10:58.734
-Oh, I love Glenn Miller.
-Come on.

11:02.100 --> 11:04.367
I met my husband
at a Glenn Miller dance.

11:05.333 --> 11:07.567
It wasn't really
the Glenn Miller orchestra.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.133
It was Dick Singleton
and the Singletones.

11:12.200 --> 11:16.133
Their motto was, "If you close your eyes,
you think it's Glenn Miller."

11:19.500 --> 11:22.300
Believe me, no matter what you did,
you knew it was Dick Singleton.

11:24.266 --> 11:26.867
Rose, Rose, you're one of a kind.

11:28.266 --> 11:30.533
That's what my husband used to say.

11:31.834 --> 11:37.266
You know... in a lot of ways...
you remind me of Charlie.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.200
The way you laugh.

11:39.734 --> 11:40.800
The way you dance.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.800
-Even the way--
-Rose,

11:43.967 --> 11:45.066
I'm not Charlie.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.333
I'm Arnie Peterson
from Plainfield, New Jersey.

11:48.800 --> 11:53.467
If you like me, it's for who I am...
not for who I remind you of.

11:55.967 --> 11:57.834
I do like you, Arnie Peterson.

11:59.734 --> 12:01.433
I like you, too, Rose Nyland.

12:33.967 --> 12:35.800
Oh, you can't sleep either, huh?

12:35.867 --> 12:38.667
-No. Want some tea?
-Oh, please.

12:41.533 --> 12:43.834
Watch what you're grabbing.
I got a specimen in there.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.800
Gee, I wonder what Rose
is doing right now.

12:52.867 --> 12:55.100
You mean, you wonder if she's
doing "it" right now.

12:56.667 --> 13:00.333
No, I just wonder if maybe we didn't push
her into something too fast.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.567
What I can't understand
is how in the world

13:02.633 --> 13:04.900
she managed to wait 15 years.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.433
How long did you wait after George died?

13:08.500 --> 13:10.633
-Till the paramedics came.
-Ma!

13:19.767 --> 13:23.333
As the reverend was performing
the funeral service...

13:24.033 --> 13:26.367
-I knew for sure that he wanted me.
-Oh...

13:30.900 --> 13:33.367
I'd always known that there'd been
something between us.

13:34.100 --> 13:37.467
Sometimes from the pulpit,
he'd be talking about sin...

13:38.233 --> 13:39.734
and he'd look straight at me.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.300
We couldn't do anything about it
'cause he was married. But...

13:45.166 --> 13:48.667
after his wife died,
there was no stopping him.

13:49.633 --> 13:53.467
-So?
-Well, we could finally consummate

13:53.533 --> 13:56.333
our long and burning passion.

13:57.433 --> 13:58.600
And?

14:01.700 --> 14:04.066
It took about ten minutes.
He wore his watch and his socks.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.367
I never saw him again.

14:08.100 --> 14:10.233
Your father didn't even
take off his pants!

14:10.300 --> 14:11.300
Ma!

14:12.100 --> 14:15.367
What about you, Dorothy?
Who was the first after Stan, hm?

14:15.433 --> 14:18.300
-Blanche.
-Her divorce lawyer.

14:19.066 --> 14:22.300
-How did you know?
-It's always the divorce lawyer.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.367
Oh, it was a terrible time for me.

14:25.433 --> 14:28.166
You know, I'd gone
on an eating binge when Stan left,

14:28.233 --> 14:31.767
and I put on quite a bit of weight.
Plus, I was not a 20-year-old.

14:32.133 --> 14:34.300
You know, when you're 20,
no matter what you do,

14:34.367 --> 14:37.467
everything stays where it's supposed to.

14:38.166 --> 14:42.867
Now, when you lean over, it looks like
somebody's let the air out of your face.

14:46.266 --> 14:47.333
-What?
-Honey,

14:47.400 --> 14:50.567
lean over a mirror some time
and take a look at yourself.

14:50.633 --> 14:53.200
-Where's a mirror?
-There's one in the tool drawer.

14:53.266 --> 14:56.100
I think you'd better take a sedative
before you look.

14:56.800 --> 14:59.734
Don't be silly.
I look at my face all the time.

14:59.800 --> 15:01.767
How different could it be leaning over?

15:02.133 --> 15:03.667
Oh, my God!

15:04.900 --> 15:08.633
Oh, my God, Dorothy!
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

15:09.767 --> 15:12.367
Only on your back, Blanche.

15:12.633 --> 15:14.400
That way, everything slides back,

15:14.467 --> 15:16.433
and you look like you
just had a face-lift.

15:18.734 --> 15:20.467
Oh, you're right. I'm gorgeous.

15:22.166 --> 15:24.200
I'm gonna have to meet men
lying down.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.200
I thought you did.

15:30.400 --> 15:34.133
Of course, that way,
not only does your face fall back,

15:34.200 --> 15:35.900
but your chest does, too.

15:37.667 --> 15:41.533
Unfortunately, it falls back
and off to the side.

15:54.200 --> 15:59.433
Rose. Rose, are you still in there?
This is crazy!

16:00.567 --> 16:01.867
Look, I talked to the purser.

16:01.934 --> 16:04.367
Another cabin is available,
and I'll move to it.

16:04.800 --> 16:08.567
But I need to get in the bathroom, Rose.
I hate to go anywhere without my Actifed.

16:11.567 --> 16:12.567
Good morning.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.166
I can't let you see my eyes.
They look terrible from crying.

16:17.667 --> 16:20.033
Rose, you couldn't possibly
look terrible to me.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.333
I left my contact lenses in the bathroom.

16:25.400 --> 16:28.867
I'm sorry. I am so sorry.

16:30.600 --> 16:34.500
Yeah... it can be awkward.

16:34.567 --> 16:37.867
I thought I could do it, I really did,
and then I couldn't.

16:39.000 --> 16:43.300
You see... it would have been the first
time since my husband died.

16:44.433 --> 16:46.133
I figured it was a first time.

16:47.033 --> 16:49.133
It's been 15 years since he died, huh?

16:49.600 --> 16:51.934
Boy, he must have been something.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.834
This may sound silly, but it's true.

16:57.767 --> 17:01.700
I felt I would be unfaithful to Charlie
if I slept with you.

17:02.467 --> 17:03.767
Rose, it's not silly.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.200
I felt that way when my wife died.

17:06.867 --> 17:08.734
-You did?
-Absolutely.

17:09.233 --> 17:10.900
'Course I didn't let that stop me.

17:13.133 --> 17:15.867
You mean you'd just make love
and feel lousy?

17:15.934 --> 17:19.500
Well... I'd feel lousy about it, but...

17:20.100 --> 17:21.967
otherwise, I'd feel terrific.

17:23.367 --> 17:27.500
That's the difference
between men and women, I guess.

17:27.567 --> 17:29.333
We can do it no matter what.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.633
Rose, I adored Molly, my wife.

17:36.633 --> 17:38.533
We were married 34 years.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.900
Never slept with another woman.

17:41.934 --> 17:47.767
I looked... I enjoyed, I patted a few
bottoms, but that was it, Rose.

17:48.467 --> 17:50.133
No, Molly was my world.

17:52.266 --> 17:53.633
Then one day...

17:55.433 --> 17:59.033
a drunk in a Chevy...
took my world away.

18:00.100 --> 18:01.934
For a year, I was a zombie.

18:03.033 --> 18:05.166
I dressed, I worked, I slept.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.767
For fun, I ate onion sandwiches.

18:09.633 --> 18:13.734
Then one day, my daughter sat me down,
she said...

18:14.133 --> 18:16.533
"Mom would hate what you're doing."

18:16.967 --> 18:20.233
She would say, "Arnie, who are you
saving yourself for? I'm dead.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.967
And I'm not in heaven
if I have to worry about you."

18:26.333 --> 18:27.467
That convinced me.

18:30.300 --> 18:33.934
I wonder... what Charlie
would say if he knew.

18:35.333 --> 18:37.533
Probably the same thing Molly said.

18:38.166 --> 18:40.367
Molly didn't actually say that, Rose.

18:43.133 --> 18:45.300
-There's something else.
-Oh?

18:46.467 --> 18:47.600
I might kill you.

18:53.266 --> 18:54.533
What? What are you talking about?

18:54.600 --> 18:56.967
I've never told anybody this in my life,

18:57.033 --> 19:01.233
but my husband died
while he was making love to me.

19:04.066 --> 19:08.834
And I'm afraid if we make love,
I'll kill you.

19:11.333 --> 19:14.767
If you haven't made love in 15 years,
that's a possibility.

19:17.834 --> 19:21.834
Hey, Rose... Rose, don't worry about it.

19:22.166 --> 19:24.333
Listen, I had a check-up
a couple of weeks ago.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.367
I got the heart of a 12-year-old.

19:27.667 --> 19:31.834
Rose, whatever you want to do
is fine with me. I just...

19:33.233 --> 19:34.967
I just like being with you.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.500
Hey... I better pack my stuff.

19:41.767 --> 19:43.367
-Arnie?
-Yeah?

19:44.233 --> 19:45.400
Sit down.

19:54.266 --> 19:55.300
Hold me.

20:18.166 --> 20:19.233
Buzz off.

20:20.967 --> 20:24.266
-I'll spot you 25 points.
-Oh, ma, enough already.

20:24.333 --> 20:26.367
I'm not gonna play cards
with you anymore.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.033
-Why not?
-Why should I?

20:28.100 --> 20:30.433
You're the only one who gets
any enjoyment out of it.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.867
Ah, cards bore me to tears.

20:33.467 --> 20:34.533
Then why do you play?

20:34.600 --> 20:37.066
-I like the talking.
-The what?

20:37.133 --> 20:41.834
The talking. You and I had some of our
best talks over a game of gin rummy.

20:42.233 --> 20:44.567
I don't know why, it just seemed easier
for both of us

20:44.633 --> 20:46.734
to open up while
we were playing cards.

20:46.800 --> 20:48.834
Your aunt Jean was the same way.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.300
During a pinochle game,

20:50.367 --> 20:55.533
she told me that she swam nude in a pool
with Charles Boyer.

20:56.967 --> 20:59.633
Aunt Jean? You never told me that.

20:59.700 --> 21:02.533
I would've gotten around to it,
but we stopped playing cards.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.667
Rose is back.
Her taxi just pulled up.

21:05.734 --> 21:08.934
Oh, I wonder if she had a great time
on that cruise.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.734
She did if she fooled around.

21:11.567 --> 21:12.867
I can't wait to find out.

21:12.934 --> 21:14.800
Oh, come on now.
It's none of our business.

21:14.867 --> 21:17.333
I bet she did.
I bet she got cold feet.

21:17.400 --> 21:19.800
Now listen, I want to know
just as much as you two,

21:19.867 --> 21:22.333
but what happened between
her and Arnie is private.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.700
If she wants to talk about it, fine.
But if she doesn't,

21:24.767 --> 21:28.967
I don't want anybody asking
any embarrassing questions.

21:30.200 --> 21:31.266
I'm back!

21:31.333 --> 21:33.900
So, did you and Arnie play
"find the cannoli"?

21:33.967 --> 21:34.967
Oh...

21:40.500 --> 21:42.967
-What?
-Nothing, nothing, Rose!

21:43.033 --> 21:45.333
Just sit down here, honey,
and tell us all about your trip.

21:45.400 --> 21:48.800
Oh, it was fabulous.
The food was delicious.

21:48.867 --> 21:50.867
The weather was absolutely gorgeous.

21:50.934 --> 21:54.133
And the activities on board ship,
well, the list goes on forever,

21:54.200 --> 21:56.233
masquerade balls, hootenannies,

21:56.300 --> 22:00.000
tours of the engine room,
fashion shows, jazzercise,

22:00.066 --> 22:04.467
Las Vegas night, Monte Carlo night,
Rio night, Riviera night--

22:04.533 --> 22:05.867
Who cares, Rose?!

22:05.934 --> 22:08.266
Did you and Arnie hit the sheets or not?

22:10.667 --> 22:12.100
Dorothy!

22:16.767 --> 22:18.800
Some women don't kiss and tell.

22:19.266 --> 22:21.867
Oh, shoot, honey, that's half the fun.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.700
Most of the boys I dated in college
were just for the stories.

22:27.400 --> 22:29.600
You must have more stories
than O. Henry.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.567
-I'm gonna unpack.
-Now, this isn't fair.

22:33.633 --> 22:35.367
-You have to tell us.
-No, you don't.

22:35.633 --> 22:39.333
But if you go out that door and don't come
back in, we'll know you didn't.

22:39.400 --> 22:41.567
And if you do come back,
that means you did.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.467
Aah!

22:53.600 --> 22:55.800
-It was wonderful.
-(Dorothy) Oh!

22:55.867 --> 22:57.834
Oh, honey this is terrific!

22:57.900 --> 23:01.400
Oh, I'm so happy and I have you two
to thank for it.

23:01.467 --> 23:02.467
You two?

23:02.533 --> 23:05.400
Don't you think Arnie should get
at least an honorable mention?

23:07.166 --> 23:10.767
I want you to know going on this cruise
changed my life.

23:11.166 --> 23:14.467
Being with Arnie made me realize
that I can care for a man again

23:14.533 --> 23:16.333
without feeling guilty about it.

23:16.734 --> 23:18.200
Oh, it's a nice feeling, you know,

23:18.266 --> 23:22.233
that when one part of your life is over,
another part can begin.

23:23.000 --> 23:24.433
Now I'm really gonna unpack.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.633
Oh, let me help you, honey.
I'll get the juicy details.

23:31.333 --> 23:32.667
Ma, Persian rummy?

23:32.734 --> 23:34.300
-500 points?
-Penny a point.

23:34.367 --> 23:38.533
You deal. I meant to tell you,
I got a card from Gloria Pelizado today.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.633
Oh? How many stamps did she use?

23:40.700 --> 23:43.200
Gloria Pelizado's been dead for two years.

23:43.266 --> 23:46.300
Who said Gloria Pelizado?
I said Flo Pelizado.

23:46.367 --> 23:49.300
-Why don't you pay attention?
-Oh, how is Flo?

23:49.700 --> 23:53.066
Oh, beautiful. She and her second husband
Pete are in Rome.

23:53.367 --> 23:55.467
You remember Pete,
the man you could've had?

23:55.533 --> 23:57.800
I did have him.
That's why I didn't want him.

24:00.033 --> 24:02.033
You and Pete?
You never told me that.

24:02.100 --> 24:05.567
Later, later. First I want to hear about
aunt Jean and Charles Boyer.

24:05.633 --> 24:07.433
Oh, well, you know your aunt Jean.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.500
She was always two steps away
from the gutter.

24:10.967 --> 24:13.667
Anyway, one summer she decided to...
