WEBVTT

00:11.098 --> 00:13.404
GARISON: A ship in trouble
making a forced landing, sir.

00:13.448 --> 00:15.928
TYLER: It comes from
the Talos star group.

00:15.972 --> 00:18.061
Their call letters check
with a survey expedition.

00:18.105 --> 00:20.107
PIKE:
My name is Christopher Pike,

00:20.150 --> 00:21.847
commander of
the space vehicleEnterprise.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.415
Our destination is
the Talos star group.

00:24.459 --> 00:26.243
PITCAIRN:
There's a canyon to the left.

00:26.287 --> 00:29.420
We can set you down there
completely unobserved.

00:32.031 --> 00:34.817
VINA: I think it's time to show
the captain our secret.

00:37.907 --> 00:39.561
This is Vina.

00:39.604 --> 00:43.260
Her parents are dead. She was
born almost as we crashed.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.175
SPOCK:
This is all some sort of trap.

00:45.219 --> 00:46.959
Are you real?

00:47.003 --> 00:50.267
Perhaps they made me
out of dreams you've forgotten.

00:50.311 --> 00:53.183
Is there any way I can keep them
from probing my mind,

00:53.227 --> 00:54.619
from using my thoughts
against me?

00:54.663 --> 00:56.230
I can't help but love you.

00:56.273 --> 00:58.536
Let's get back
to the ship.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.190
I can't.

01:00.234 --> 01:03.063
I can't go with you.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.980
PIKE: Personal log,
Captain Christopher Pike.

01:08.024 --> 01:10.635
Stardate 1532.9.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.289
Still no word
from Commander Burnham,

01:12.333 --> 01:14.248
but I know she won't give up

01:14.291 --> 01:15.684
until she finds
her brother Spock.

01:15.727 --> 01:18.295
As much as it pains me
to think the worst

01:18.339 --> 01:19.949
of any Starfleet division,

01:19.992 --> 01:22.995
I do hope she locates him
before Section 31 does.

01:29.915 --> 01:32.135
...is restricted
to all unauthorized personnel

01:32.179 --> 01:34.181
until further notice.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.486
PATAR: It is critical
Lieutenant Spock

01:35.530 --> 01:37.140
be apprehended
as soon as possible.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.794
And by fleeing
with her brother,

01:38.837 --> 01:42.145
Commander Burnham has committed
yet another act of mutiny.

01:42.189 --> 01:44.669
I accept full responsibility
for our security lapse.

01:44.713 --> 01:47.455
As you should.
Spock's foreknowledge

01:47.498 --> 01:49.457
of these signals appearing
around the galaxy

01:49.500 --> 01:51.111
and his interactions
with the Red Angel

01:51.154 --> 01:52.721
constitute vital intelligence.

01:52.764 --> 01:54.157
Are you tracking their shuttle?

01:54.201 --> 01:56.594
We had a lock on its trajectory
for only minutes

01:56.638 --> 01:58.118
before it was lost.

01:58.161 --> 01:59.815
Burnham disabled
her transponder.

01:59.858 --> 02:03.210
She's smart. I expect she'll
obscure her warp signature

02:03.253 --> 02:04.907
to keep us from
regaining a trace.

02:04.950 --> 02:06.604
PATAR:
She can't hide forever.

02:06.648 --> 02:09.085
Spock's in need of vital
medical intervention.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.175
That limits their
potential destinations.

02:12.219 --> 02:14.221
Any chance of you
getting us a list

02:14.264 --> 02:16.484
of off-planet Vulcan
medical facilities?

02:16.527 --> 02:19.226
Control's threat-analysis system
will prioritize those.

02:19.269 --> 02:20.488
Any other
suggestions?

02:20.531 --> 02:22.316
I believe that we should...

02:22.359 --> 02:23.578
I was asking Captain Georgiou.

02:23.621 --> 02:26.015
Since you asked,
I would put out

02:26.058 --> 02:28.365
a Federation-wide alert
for Burnham's shuttle,

02:28.409 --> 02:29.671
but exclude
Discovery.

02:29.714 --> 02:31.629
TELLARITE ADMIRAL:
Exclude Discovery?

02:31.673 --> 02:33.065
Why?

02:33.109 --> 02:34.589
We don't want
personal entanglements

02:34.632 --> 02:36.199
complicating the search.

02:36.243 --> 02:37.809
If Burnham were to
reach out to anyone,

02:37.853 --> 02:39.246
it would be Pike.

02:39.289 --> 02:42.292
Let's listen for it
but not tip our hand.

02:42.336 --> 02:44.076
Excellent observation.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.297
Captain Leland, you have an
agent on Captain Pike's ship?

02:47.341 --> 02:49.212
Specialist Tyler
is on board, yes.
Good.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.302
Because if Burnham communicates
with Discovery,

02:52.346 --> 02:53.825
we need to know.

02:53.869 --> 02:55.087
Keep us informed.

02:56.263 --> 02:58.482
GEORGIOU:
All of this reliance on

02:58.526 --> 03:01.920
computerized threat analysis
bothers me.

03:01.964 --> 03:04.140
In my universe,
the artificial intelligence

03:04.184 --> 03:06.316
took orders from me,
not the other way around.

03:06.360 --> 03:07.622
Really?

03:07.665 --> 03:10.581
And how did that
work out for you?

03:10.625 --> 03:12.931
Why don't you whip up a
good reason for Discovery

03:12.975 --> 03:14.846
to stand down and relay
the orders to them,

03:14.890 --> 03:16.805
since you're on a roll.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.067
MAN :
Encryption protocol verification

03:18.110 --> 03:20.591
has been ordered for all...

03:20.635 --> 03:23.420
GEORGIOU: We'll find Spock
and Burnham, of course,

03:23.464 --> 03:26.597
and they'll have a lovely time
answering many, many questions.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.164
In the meantime,
since you

03:28.208 --> 03:30.253
felt it necessary
to destroy that probe,

03:30.297 --> 03:32.560
we'd like you to comb
through the debris field

03:32.603 --> 03:35.345
to find any remains that
could help us understand

03:35.389 --> 03:36.738
what it was made from

03:36.781 --> 03:39.175
and why it accessed
your computers.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.437
That kind of thing.

03:40.481 --> 03:41.830
Are you sure Commander Burnham

03:41.873 --> 03:43.353
received the hails
from your ship

03:43.397 --> 03:45.268
and that she deliberately
ignored them?

03:45.312 --> 03:46.878
Why would I lie?

03:46.922 --> 03:49.403
Michael always has a logical
motivation for her actions.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.318
Believe me,
I know her well.

03:51.361 --> 03:53.363
GEORGIOU: No matter how
you may feel about her,

03:53.407 --> 03:55.887
she is aiding and abetting
a murder suspect.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.585
PIKE: Who also happens
to be her brother.

03:57.628 --> 04:00.240
There are many different
approaches here.

04:00.283 --> 04:03.068
The Discoverycan be
a more valuable asset.

04:03.112 --> 04:05.288
Discovery'svalue lies
in gathering more intel

04:05.332 --> 04:06.376
on the probe.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.944
Oh, and if Burnham
checks in,

04:08.987 --> 04:12.121
we need to know
immediately, okay?

04:12.164 --> 04:14.993
I'm really busy.

04:15.037 --> 04:18.301
All right. My tolerance for
discretion has worn very thin.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.563
What, exactly,
is your relationship

04:19.607 --> 04:20.869
with Michael Burnham?

04:20.911 --> 04:23.350
It's 100% professional, sir.

04:23.393 --> 04:26.091
And has that always
been the case?

04:26.135 --> 04:28.093
Mr. Tyler,

04:28.137 --> 04:31.358
you and I have been through
a lot together recently.

04:31.401 --> 04:32.968
I'm giving you the benefit
of the doubt,

04:33.011 --> 04:35.057
and I'm asking that you do
the same with me.

04:36.363 --> 04:39.148
I was in love with Michael,

04:39.191 --> 04:42.499
and she was... not entirely
disinterested in me.

04:42.543 --> 04:45.415
But I violated
her trust.

04:45.459 --> 04:49.985
I wasn't the person she thought
I was, so she... moved on.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.336
I apologize, Mr. Tyler, but...

04:53.380 --> 04:55.686
I'm responsible
for a lot of lives here.

04:55.730 --> 04:57.906
Your feelings could impact
our mission.

04:57.949 --> 05:00.474
They won't.

05:00.517 --> 05:03.041
Permission to be
excused, Captain.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.402
COMPUTER:
One of 11 planetary bodies,

05:15.445 --> 05:18.274
Talos IV was a warp-capable
M-Class planet

05:18.318 --> 05:20.407
with a thriving population,

05:20.450 --> 05:22.539
until several thousand
years ago,

05:22.583 --> 05:26.064
when nuclear war caused
a near-extinction-level event.

05:26.108 --> 05:30.286
A small population of
the indigenous species remains,

05:30.330 --> 05:32.636
possessing susceptive
psychogenic abilities.

05:32.680 --> 05:36.118
Travel within the Talos system
is prohibited by Starfleet.

05:48.913 --> 05:51.089
We're approaching
Talos IV.

05:51.133 --> 05:53.875
Whatever it is you're
looking for, I hope we find it.

05:55.311 --> 05:57.966
COMPUTER: Warning.
Now entering restricted space.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.838
Warning.

06:00.882 --> 06:02.971
Shuttle entering critical orbit.

06:03.014 --> 06:04.015
Correct course.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.547
Computer, reverse
starboard impulse engine

06:13.590 --> 06:14.417
and engage warp drive.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.638
BURNHAM:
Spock!

06:17.681 --> 06:19.901
It's a black hole.
We'll be crushed.

06:28.649 --> 06:31.608
COMPUTER: Structural failure
in five seconds.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.176
Four. Three.

06:34.219 --> 06:36.134
Two. One.

06:48.146 --> 06:50.453
Was that an illusion?

06:53.717 --> 06:55.502
No, it was a test.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.460
We're really on
the other side of

06:57.504 --> 06:59.419
the looking glass now,
aren't we?

08:37.604 --> 08:41.042
So, uh, not much
has changed.

08:41.085 --> 08:44.349
Should feel
pretty familiar.

08:44.393 --> 08:47.048
More or less.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.137
Anyway, I think
we should, uh,

08:49.180 --> 08:51.139
take full advantage
of this opportunity.

08:51.182 --> 08:54.142
You wouldn't believe how much
personal time I have saved up.

08:54.185 --> 08:56.927
Yes, I would.

08:56.971 --> 08:59.800
You spent every
waking moment in your lab,

08:59.843 --> 09:04.065
weekends, nights.

09:04.108 --> 09:06.502
Great, so, uh, looks like
your memory's fully intact.

09:06.546 --> 09:07.982
That's good news.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.772
I was hoping
the first time you saw him

09:15.816 --> 09:19.167
would be, uh...
I don't know, I...

09:19.210 --> 09:20.777
I'm just glad we're together.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.781
Look, I'm gonna make
a formal request

09:24.825 --> 09:27.175
to have Tyler's quarters
moved to a different deck.

09:27.218 --> 09:31.701
There's no reason you should
have to see his face every day.

09:35.879 --> 09:38.882
Here we are. Home.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.865
Airiam, how we doing
on the datacore audit?

10:04.908 --> 10:06.823
The probe used multiple
SQL injections,

10:06.867 --> 10:09.217
but I've yet to find
any compromised files.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.828
The list of facilities
you asked for, Captain.

10:13.308 --> 10:14.875
That's more
than I thought.

10:14.918 --> 10:16.964
All right, start with the
Quiliam Station in Beta Quadrant

10:17.007 --> 10:18.226
and work your
way around.

10:18.269 --> 10:20.054
Quiliam?

10:20.097 --> 10:22.230
That's a Vulcan
hospital.

10:22.273 --> 10:24.014
You're looking for
Spock and Burnham?

10:24.058 --> 10:25.537
Georgiou made it
pretty clear we were

10:25.581 --> 10:27.714
to concentrate on collecting
debris from the probe.

10:27.757 --> 10:30.673
And we are. The crew is on task.
Ensign Tilly,

10:30.717 --> 10:31.979
care to bring Specialist Tyler
up to speed

10:32.022 --> 10:33.720
on our probe search?Oh, yes, sir.

10:33.763 --> 10:34.808
Come into my office.

10:34.851 --> 10:36.897
TYLER:
What's up?

10:36.940 --> 10:40.030
Okay, so this is
your Class-C mid-embrace

10:40.074 --> 10:43.207
with a very unpleasant
and time-traversing cephalopod.

10:43.251 --> 10:45.079
What's that?Like a squid.

10:45.122 --> 10:49.518
Here you are
post-self-destruct.

10:49.561 --> 10:53.130
And so far, we have reclaimed
one metric ton of material,

10:53.174 --> 10:54.479
all of which is
from your shuttle.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.916
There are no probe parts.

10:55.959 --> 10:59.136
How is that possible?PIKE: We don't know.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.877
Point is, we're doing our job.

11:00.921 --> 11:04.533
If Section 31 wants us
to stay stationary, so be it,

11:04.576 --> 11:08.885
but I won't ignore a crisis
involving my officers.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.165
COMPUTER:
Atmosphere: 18% oxygen,

11:28.209 --> 11:30.994
75% nitrogen,

11:31.038 --> 11:34.084
4.6% carbon dioxide.

11:34.128 --> 11:36.260
Temperature:
24 degrees Celsius.

11:36.304 --> 11:37.871
I need to take
a look around.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.481
Will you be okay here?

13:03.478 --> 13:04.696
BURNHAM:
Turn.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.351
Slowly.

13:11.747 --> 13:13.705
Who are you?Where I come from,

13:13.749 --> 13:17.187
the one holding the phaser
asks the questions.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.668
Are you Talosian?
No.

13:19.711 --> 13:22.497
Human, but a permanent resident.

13:27.894 --> 13:29.112
Spock.

13:29.156 --> 13:31.636
It's me.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.638
Vina.

13:33.682 --> 13:36.206
Don't you
recognize me?

13:36.250 --> 13:38.078
What's happened to him?

13:38.121 --> 13:39.731
Who are you?

13:41.124 --> 13:44.649
I'm an old friend
of Captain Christopher Pike.

13:44.693 --> 13:46.564
Is-is Chris...

13:46.608 --> 13:48.131
is he coming back, as well?

13:48.175 --> 13:50.220
Are you saying Captain Pike
and Spock have both

13:50.264 --> 13:52.135
been here before?Well, in some ways,

13:52.179 --> 13:54.050
Captain Pike never left.

13:55.747 --> 13:57.924
I was a crew member
on a survey ship

13:57.967 --> 13:59.490
that crashed here
when I was young.

13:59.534 --> 14:02.537
Long ago.

14:02.580 --> 14:05.322
The Talosians put me
back together.

14:05.366 --> 14:07.063
That's the easiest way
to explain it.

14:07.107 --> 14:08.804
I'm Commander Michael Burnham.

14:11.111 --> 14:13.069
They welcome you, Commander,

14:13.113 --> 14:14.679
and ask that
you join them

14:14.723 --> 14:15.985
below the surface.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.857
They're speaking to you now?

14:19.119 --> 14:20.816
Beam down with Spock

14:20.860 --> 14:22.339
so they can
examine him.

14:22.383 --> 14:25.038
What do you mean,
"examine"?

14:25.081 --> 14:27.562
You brought us here
because you knew

14:27.605 --> 14:29.172
the Talosians could help you.

14:29.216 --> 14:30.608
Have you been in communication
with them?

14:32.741 --> 14:34.090
VINA:
They assure you,

14:34.134 --> 14:35.135
your shuttle will be safe here.

14:35.178 --> 14:36.223
Coordinates, please.

14:54.328 --> 14:56.330
Computer, two to beam down.

15:10.300 --> 15:11.301
Vina.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.391
Are you real?

15:14.435 --> 15:16.785
TALOSIAN MALE:
She is very real.

15:29.363 --> 15:30.973
We apologize
for the difficulties

15:31.017 --> 15:33.106
entering the atmosphere.

15:33.149 --> 15:36.196
Material illusion is our primary form of defense.

15:36.239 --> 15:37.806
BURNHAM:
I'm beginning to
understand that.

15:37.849 --> 15:41.114
Do you only speak
telepathically?

15:41.157 --> 15:44.769
We will converse in
the ancient way if you prefer.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.815
Can you tell me
why, exactly,

15:46.858 --> 15:49.209
he risked our lives
bringing us here?

15:55.432 --> 15:58.392
The Vulcan
is experiencing time

15:58.435 --> 16:01.177
as a fluid rather than
a linear construct.

16:01.221 --> 16:03.571
Conventional logic
has not helped him

16:03.614 --> 16:05.573
interpret
such an experience.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.838
He knew you'd be
able to help him.

16:09.881 --> 16:11.883
He knew that conventional
medical understanding

16:11.927 --> 16:13.668
would be useless.

16:13.711 --> 16:16.888
Should this variance continue,
he will lose his mind,

16:16.932 --> 16:18.847
permanently.

16:18.890 --> 16:21.371
What could have possibly changed
his experience of time?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.069
It is easier
for us to show you

16:23.112 --> 16:24.896
his thoughts than
explain them.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.508
But we require
something in return.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.031
The memory of what happened

16:29.075 --> 16:31.338
between you and your brother
on Vulcan.

16:31.381 --> 16:34.167
TALOSIAN MALE:
We wish to view
the entire conflict

16:34.210 --> 16:36.256
between the two of you
during childhood.

16:36.299 --> 16:38.258
The defining experience.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.303
The wound you inflicted.

16:41.304 --> 16:44.264
You want to experience our pain?

16:44.307 --> 16:47.310
Why? For your entertainment?

16:47.354 --> 16:50.705
This is how we understand.
How we survive.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.750
Survive another way.

17:02.978 --> 17:04.893
TALOSIAN FEMALE:
Your brother's sanity

17:04.935 --> 17:07.242
will depend entirely
on your cooperation.

17:10.029 --> 17:12.857
It's better not to
resist, Commander.

17:14.207 --> 17:17.775
They dive deeply
into our minds.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.255
Our hopes.

17:19.299 --> 17:21.953
Our memories,
our fears.

17:24.042 --> 17:25.740
Even our dreams.

17:42.713 --> 17:46.761
This is how they found me
after the crash.

17:47.849 --> 17:50.243
They gave me the choice:

17:50.286 --> 17:54.247
to live the rest of my life
as I am

17:54.290 --> 17:56.162
or as I was.

18:04.431 --> 18:08.435
You see? They're not
unnecessarily cruel.

18:08.478 --> 18:12.352
And even though this may just be
a projection, it...

18:14.658 --> 18:18.140
...it feels as real as it looks.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.924
TALOSIAN FEMALE:
To reorder your brother's mind,

18:19.968 --> 18:22.753
we must disengage him
from logic.

18:22.797 --> 18:25.278
But you must pay the price.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.846
We may watch you
relive your memory?

18:35.288 --> 18:37.028
Yes.

18:37.072 --> 18:40.293
But I need to see
my brother's mind first.

18:42.469 --> 18:45.211
Very well.

18:56.787 --> 18:59.964
SPOCK:
It began the night
you ran away from our home.

19:01.836 --> 19:03.359
Deep into the forests
of Vulcan's Forge

19:03.403 --> 19:06.101
and its many dangers.

19:07.842 --> 19:10.627
That is when the Angel
first appeared to me.

19:10.671 --> 19:14.979
I thought it was a dream,
a premonition.

19:15.023 --> 19:17.504
It showed me...

19:19.984 --> 19:21.943
...your death.

19:30.691 --> 19:34.738
I told Mother and Father where
I had seen you in the forest.

19:50.232 --> 19:52.191
They found you.

19:53.409 --> 19:55.411
The Angel saved you.

19:56.717 --> 19:58.719
She changed your fate.

20:00.547 --> 20:04.725
Years later,
it appeared to me once again.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.989
Another dream,
another premonition.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.818
I now understand its meaning.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.951
And where it must lead me.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.911
It guided me to a remote planet

20:16.954 --> 20:20.349
and showed me...

20:20.393 --> 20:22.438
the end.

20:31.839 --> 20:34.145
My mind

20:34.189 --> 20:36.147
to your mind.

20:36.191 --> 20:38.759
My thoughts to your thoughts.

21:19.408 --> 21:23.630
Now you see.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.079
Dinner is served.

21:38.122 --> 21:41.604
Computer,
music, please.

21:43.214 --> 21:46.043
You kept all my things.

21:46.087 --> 21:50.091
Well, I-I thought about, uh,
sending stuff to your mom.

21:50.134 --> 21:52.441
I tried to pack it.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.269
It was too hard.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.750
I wasn't ready, I guess.

21:58.142 --> 22:01.363
Here, um, first course.

22:01.407 --> 22:04.758
Asopao. Your recipe.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.165
Is it good?

22:21.209 --> 22:23.777
Yeah, I-I guess, it's just...

22:23.820 --> 22:25.909
It's just unfamiliar.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.694
It's your favorite.

22:27.737 --> 22:29.478
I have that memory.

22:29.522 --> 22:32.220
It's just, my-my
senses, my feelings

22:32.263 --> 22:35.049
don't connect with it.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.268
Or anything, really.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.185
I-I think
wh-what you're dealing with

22:41.229 --> 22:44.145
is-is a-a form
of neutralizing shock.

22:44.188 --> 22:45.407
It's not that simple, Paul.

22:45.451 --> 22:48.192
It's not a matter of identity,

22:48.236 --> 22:50.630
because we know who you are.

22:50.673 --> 22:52.196
Or maybe that's just who I was.

22:52.240 --> 22:53.589
I-I think we should try
to normalize...

22:53.633 --> 22:56.244
What's normal about this?

22:56.287 --> 22:59.160
You never put together dinner
in our quarters before.

22:59.203 --> 23:02.076
I'm just trying to help.
I'll do anything.

23:02.119 --> 23:03.120
Please tell me how...

23:03.164 --> 23:05.384
I don't know what to do!

23:05.427 --> 23:07.429
You keep pushing me
to feel something!

23:07.473 --> 23:10.171
You want me to just
pick up where we left off

23:10.214 --> 23:13.130
as if nothing happened?
You have no idea!

23:18.266 --> 23:20.964
Look, uh,

23:21.008 --> 23:25.534
losing you was-was the worst
thing that ever happened, but...

23:25.578 --> 23:29.146
but now that you're here again,
I'm-I'm just trying to treat it

23:29.190 --> 23:31.627
like what it is: a miracle

23:31.671 --> 23:34.325
that I dreamed about
every night

23:34.369 --> 23:36.284
since you...

23:36.327 --> 23:37.154
Since I died.

23:38.199 --> 23:40.288
Say it!

23:40.331 --> 23:42.290
Why are you so angry with me?

23:42.333 --> 23:44.205
You know what, Paul?

23:45.336 --> 23:47.164
That's a good question.

23:52.779 --> 23:56.478
Mr. Tyler, this is my ship.

23:56.522 --> 24:01.004
More importantly,
this is my crew.

24:01.048 --> 24:03.703
I will not call off the search.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.183
I will not leave two
of them out there.

24:06.227 --> 24:07.750
Certainly not when one
is accused of crimes

24:07.794 --> 24:09.535
I don't believe he committed.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.232
When we're not
in our right minds,

24:11.275 --> 24:12.538
Captain,

24:12.581 --> 24:14.453
we're capable of anything.

24:14.496 --> 24:16.237
I can believe that about you.

24:17.717 --> 24:20.067
Not about Spock.

24:20.110 --> 24:21.198
It doesn't matter
what you believe.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.635
31 believes he's a killer.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.593
You may find them first,
but you won't get to them first.

24:24.637 --> 24:27.117
Section 31
is watching you.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.163
Not just Leland and Georgiou,
but their whole operation.

24:29.206 --> 24:31.165
Do you think you're surprising
me with this information?

24:31.208 --> 24:34.385
When Leland reaches Spock
and Burnham, he will bury them.

24:34.429 --> 24:36.605
Discovery'ssearch only
shines a light on her.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.041
What are you saying?

24:38.085 --> 24:40.696
Trust Michael to find
the right way through.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.177
Ultimately, it's the safer
choice for both of them.

24:43.220 --> 24:45.396
If you trust Burnham

24:45.440 --> 24:50.227
more than Section 31,

24:50.271 --> 24:52.229
why are you working for them?

24:52.273 --> 24:55.145
I know they act in gray areas,

24:55.189 --> 24:57.147
and I know
they're dedicated people

24:57.191 --> 24:58.366
trying to keep you

24:58.409 --> 25:00.281
and every other part
of the Federation safe.

25:00.324 --> 25:05.286
After what I've been through,
after what I've become,

25:05.329 --> 25:07.549
I can be of service there.

25:19.300 --> 25:20.910
SARU:
Captain,

25:20.954 --> 25:23.347
may I have a moment?Walk with me.

25:23.391 --> 25:26.350
It appears someone on our ship
accessed the transceiver array

25:26.394 --> 25:28.135
and sent out an encrypted,

25:28.178 --> 25:30.311
unauthorized subspace
transmission.

25:30.354 --> 25:31.791
Three of them, actually.

25:31.834 --> 25:33.619
Large bursts.
Petabytes of data.

25:33.662 --> 25:36.012
An unauthorized
transmission? Where?

25:36.056 --> 25:38.058
Unknown, sir.

25:40.103 --> 25:43.367
Not just anyone can
access that array.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.848
There must be some
trace of the sender.

25:45.892 --> 25:49.199
Well, if there is, sir,
we will find it.

26:00.036 --> 26:02.125
Spock.

26:05.346 --> 26:08.044
You saw the Red Angel.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.655
First as a child,

26:09.698 --> 26:12.266
then again a few months ago.What is it?

26:12.309 --> 26:14.311
Who is it?If I knew,
we would not be here.

26:14.355 --> 26:16.357
I was asking rhetorically.

26:16.400 --> 26:18.446
Then at least ask something
I have never asked of myself.

26:18.489 --> 26:21.101
Can we have a better version
of this conversation?

26:21.144 --> 26:22.929
Is there a valuable question
in your arsenal?

26:22.972 --> 26:24.408
Yes. Do you actually think
the beard is working?

26:31.198 --> 26:35.289
The barren planets...
Andoria, Earth.

26:35.332 --> 26:37.073
Is the Angel a time traveler?

26:37.117 --> 26:38.509
The engineering
comprehension

26:38.553 --> 26:40.642
necessary to build its suit
would suggest so.

26:40.686 --> 26:42.862
And some of the memories
it shared with me

26:42.905 --> 26:43.863
have yet to occur.

26:45.995 --> 26:47.344
There was no one left.

26:47.388 --> 26:48.868
A possible future.

26:48.911 --> 26:51.218
One that could well be
determined by our actions.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.568
Yours and mine.

26:53.612 --> 26:54.961
Yeah, yours and mine.

26:55.004 --> 26:57.528
Spock, there is
so much that I...

26:57.572 --> 27:01.402
No. I am not here
to absolve you, Michael Burnham.

27:01.445 --> 27:03.534
This is not about your feelings.

27:03.578 --> 27:06.233
Guess I'm a fool
for taking that personally.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.104
Agreed.

27:08.148 --> 27:10.019
I risked everything
to bring you here.

27:10.063 --> 27:13.196
It does not surprise me
that you see it that way.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.329
But it was I
who brought you here

27:15.372 --> 27:16.591
to see what I have seen.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.115
How does my seeing help you?

27:19.159 --> 27:23.206
I required someone who had
context of my timeline.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.512
Of me.

27:24.555 --> 27:27.515
So you required family.

27:27.558 --> 27:28.690
An interesting choice of words,

27:28.734 --> 27:30.823
coming from you.

27:30.866 --> 27:32.128
Shall we continue?

27:32.172 --> 27:33.826
There is a great responsibility
at hand.

27:35.436 --> 27:38.482
To serve the needs of the many.

27:38.526 --> 27:40.093
I'm listening. Talk.

27:40.136 --> 27:42.704
An impermeable layer of energy
surrounding the suit.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.794
A quantum field
I was unable to infiltrate.

27:45.838 --> 27:50.277
Still, the thoughts I received
from within it were human.

27:50.320 --> 27:51.539
Human?

27:51.582 --> 27:54.716
There was loneliness,

27:54.760 --> 27:56.457
desperation.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.719
You will need to see more.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.434
Our hosts will attempt
to safeguard your mind

28:17.478 --> 28:18.609
if you continue.

28:18.653 --> 28:20.437
But if you need
to rest before...

28:20.481 --> 28:22.483
No, I don't.
Show me.

28:49.989 --> 28:53.906
Mr. Spock,
there's been an event.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.952
Signals in space seen
across the galaxy.

28:56.996 --> 29:00.956
The pattern is undeniably
what you previously described.

29:04.568 --> 29:06.048
And what you are drawing here.

29:07.136 --> 29:08.790
They're real.

29:08.834 --> 29:11.532
My vision wasn't
a hallucination?

29:11.575 --> 29:14.970
"Premonition" might be
a more accurate word.

29:17.886 --> 29:21.760
Then the images I saw
in the mind meld...

29:21.803 --> 29:23.849
these signals...

29:23.892 --> 29:25.807
Somehow, you reported them
before they appeared.

29:25.851 --> 29:28.114
What do you think they are?

29:28.157 --> 29:32.205
I believe they represent
an attempt to communicate.

29:32.248 --> 29:34.076
By whom?

29:37.776 --> 29:40.517
Perhaps these signals
have appeared before.

29:40.561 --> 29:42.302
Somewhere else?

29:42.345 --> 29:44.826
As a Starfleet science officer,
you would have been exposed

29:44.870 --> 29:46.306
to a comprehensive
historical...

29:46.349 --> 29:48.525
History will not provide
an answer to your query, Doctor.

29:48.569 --> 29:52.138
Instead, you should be
asking me...

29:52.181 --> 29:54.531
how is it I can
remember tomorrow?

29:58.535 --> 30:00.799
It was a mistake to come here.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.933
I must leave.

30:08.937 --> 30:12.462
Mr. Spock, leaving
would be premature.

30:12.506 --> 30:15.161
There are Section 31 officers
coming to transfer you

30:15.204 --> 30:16.858
to a more specialized facility.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.381
Section 31?

30:18.425 --> 30:20.035
Your mind is in crisis.

30:20.079 --> 30:22.342
The Vulcan part of you
requires time to heal.

30:22.385 --> 30:24.518
SPOCK:
You are correct.

30:24.561 --> 30:27.303
Time most certainly has
something to do with it.

30:35.007 --> 30:37.052
What happened after that?

30:37.096 --> 30:40.186
Section 31 thinks
you murdered these people.

30:40.229 --> 30:42.492
I see your faith
in my character has not changed

30:42.536 --> 30:44.407
since we were children.

30:44.451 --> 30:48.020
You are inside my mind,
yet you still need confirmation.

30:49.325 --> 30:51.806
Do you see murder here?

31:35.023 --> 31:36.459
I'm sorry.

31:38.592 --> 31:40.986
I don't expect you
to understand,

31:41.029 --> 31:42.944
but...

31:42.988 --> 31:44.467
it wasn't really me.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.036
It was Voq.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.082
Yes.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.131
Bring him out.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.567
It doesn't work like that.

31:57.611 --> 31:58.917
I can find him.

32:04.270 --> 32:06.881
This must be allowed
to play out.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.056
Are you sure about that?

32:08.100 --> 32:09.188
Stop it.

32:14.802 --> 32:16.369
Stop! Stop, you...

32:16.412 --> 32:18.632
Bring him out!

32:51.665 --> 32:53.972
I don't even know
who I am anymore.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.194
Who do you think
you're talking to?

33:24.567 --> 33:26.961
You allowed the fight
to proceed?

33:27.005 --> 33:28.571
Well, I believe the
confrontation was

33:28.615 --> 33:31.226
a necessary and
unavoidable catharsis

33:31.270 --> 33:33.228
for both men.

33:33.272 --> 33:36.188
But hardly an example
of by-the-book

33:36.231 --> 33:38.668
conflict resolution.

33:38.712 --> 33:42.324
The Starfleet manual offers
no regulatory guidelines

33:42.368 --> 33:44.152
for interactions
between humans

33:44.196 --> 33:46.154
with Klingons grafted
to their bones

33:46.198 --> 33:49.288
and a ship's doctor
returned from the dead.

33:52.247 --> 33:53.683
Then, occasionally,

33:53.727 --> 33:55.772
we have to make it up
as we go along.

33:55.816 --> 33:59.211
SARU: That is the situation
in which we find ourselves, yes.

33:59.254 --> 34:02.562
This is not intended
with any judgment, Mr. Saru,

34:02.605 --> 34:05.260
but I suspect that,
before your own evolution,

34:05.304 --> 34:09.047
you might have made
a different call.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.266
Perhaps, Captain.

34:11.310 --> 34:13.746
Given the unusual nature
of our circumstances,

34:13.790 --> 34:15.270
I'm going to overlook
the incident,

34:15.313 --> 34:16.880
but this can't happen again.

34:16.924 --> 34:19.882
And please make sure
everyone's aware that

34:19.927 --> 34:22.147
we will not be settling
our differences with violence,

34:22.190 --> 34:24.105
but with the uniform
code of contact.

34:24.149 --> 34:26.455
And that goes
for you as well.

34:26.498 --> 34:27.674
Understood, Captain.

34:27.717 --> 34:29.154
Good.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.217
Vina.

34:51.567 --> 34:53.351
Vina.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.614
H-How...

34:54.657 --> 34:57.356
I'm not used to you
being afraid of me.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.836
Used to me?

34:59.880 --> 35:01.316
It's a lot to digest.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.232
There's something
I need to say.

35:04.276 --> 35:06.930
When you came to Talos,

35:06.974 --> 35:10.238
I'd been alone
for so many years.

35:10.282 --> 35:13.067
I never imagined
happiness or love.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.722
And when the Talosians
decided we were

35:15.765 --> 35:17.289
unsuited for each other...

35:17.332 --> 35:20.118
when you left, it was worse.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.250
Because I knew what I'd lost.

35:27.168 --> 35:32.521
I've thought about you--
us-- often,

35:32.565 --> 35:35.045
and wished that you
would have come with me.

35:35.089 --> 35:38.092
Chris, I didn't need to.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.268
That's what I'm trying to say.

35:40.312 --> 35:42.618
They brought you
back to me.

35:42.662 --> 35:47.928
Not the real you--
it's illusory, of course--

35:47.971 --> 35:51.497
but the part of you that
still lives inside of me.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.413
We've spent a lifetime together.

35:55.283 --> 35:56.980
I'm glad...

35:58.373 --> 36:00.114
I'm glad you're not alone.

36:01.246 --> 36:04.379
All this time, you kept me sane.

36:04.423 --> 36:08.122
Kept me tethered
to what I once felt.

36:08.166 --> 36:11.256
Even though I was never
the person you thought I was.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.432
You didn't deceive
anyone, Vina.

36:13.475 --> 36:16.086
I felt it, too.

36:24.269 --> 36:25.444
But you're here now.

36:30.144 --> 36:31.798
This is real.

36:31.841 --> 36:34.279
As real as it
needs to be.

36:34.322 --> 36:38.761
But the Talosians' ability to
project illusions across space

36:38.805 --> 36:40.241
is limited.

36:40.285 --> 36:41.982
And the farther
away you are,

36:42.025 --> 36:44.114
the harder it is
to sustain.

36:47.248 --> 36:49.685
There's someone you need to see.

37:00.174 --> 37:02.176
Burnham.

37:06.180 --> 37:08.400
You're on Talos?

37:08.443 --> 37:10.228
Can you see me?

37:10.271 --> 37:11.968
Yes, Captain.

37:12.012 --> 37:14.232
I found Spock.

37:14.275 --> 37:15.320
He directed us here
so the Talosians

37:15.363 --> 37:16.756
could show me his mind.

37:16.799 --> 37:19.367
The first thing
I need to tell you is

37:19.411 --> 37:21.108
Spock is innocent.

37:21.151 --> 37:22.762
There were no murders.

37:22.805 --> 37:25.112
I didn't want to communicate
through subspace.

37:25.155 --> 37:27.332
Section 31 might have
traced our transmission.

37:27.375 --> 37:29.029
I know what happened.
Georgiou reported

37:29.072 --> 37:30.596
that she tried
to hail your shuttle

37:30.639 --> 37:32.989
while Spock was on board
and you failed to respond.

37:33.033 --> 37:35.340
I took Spock to Captain Leland,
and he tried to use

37:35.383 --> 37:37.342
invasive Terran technology
to rip his mind apart.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.822
But why? What do they
want with Spock?

37:41.955 --> 37:44.436
My memories of the future.

37:44.479 --> 37:48.353
Spock... it is good to see you.

37:48.396 --> 37:51.007
Captain, I have seen
the Red Angel,

37:51.051 --> 37:53.793
and it revealed the final
outcome of our current timeline.

37:53.836 --> 37:55.751
If we are to escape
what awaits us,

37:55.795 --> 37:57.927
we must follow
the Angel's design.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.189
What design?

37:59.233 --> 38:01.409
Please, the window
is closing.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.019
SPOCK:
Captain,

38:03.063 --> 38:06.719
I never believed I would
ask this of anyone,

38:06.762 --> 38:08.808
but I need you
to take me on faith.

38:08.851 --> 38:11.506
You must come
for us now, if you can.

38:16.163 --> 38:18.296
Chris, hurry.

38:18.339 --> 38:20.515
We're out of time.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.041
Hurry for your friends.

38:25.085 --> 38:28.001
They're counting on you.

38:40.230 --> 38:41.928
You should at least...

38:41.971 --> 38:44.974
at least get your hand
checked out.

38:45.018 --> 38:46.715
Why?

38:48.804 --> 38:51.111
I-I can feel it.

38:53.505 --> 38:58.379
And I'm not letting anyone
fix things I can feel.

38:58.423 --> 39:01.121
Look, just come home and...

39:01.164 --> 39:02.949
It's not my home anymore, Paul.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.908
That version of me

39:05.952 --> 39:09.347
that called your quarters home,
that version of me is dead.

39:10.348 --> 39:12.741
And I'm not going back.

39:12.785 --> 39:14.613
But is it because

39:14.656 --> 39:17.398
you don't want to or...

39:17.442 --> 39:21.533
because you don't know how?What difference does it make?

39:21.576 --> 39:23.622
Would you please
just move forward?

39:25.841 --> 39:28.888
And let me do the same.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.673
I, uh...

39:34.241 --> 39:35.503
Okay.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.638
MAN :
Commander Stamets
to Engineering.

39:41.161 --> 39:42.858
Engineering, status, please.

39:44.904 --> 39:46.427
Commander Stamets
is just getting

39:46.471 --> 39:48.429
into position now,
Captain.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.475
What's our destination, Captain?

39:50.518 --> 39:52.128
Talos IV.

39:52.172 --> 39:53.652
OWOSEKUN:
Captain.

39:53.695 --> 39:55.044
Talos is in a restricted section

39:55.088 --> 39:56.437
of the Alpha Quadrant.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.091
Yes, it is.

39:58.134 --> 39:59.614
Hit it, Airiam.

40:07.753 --> 40:10.625
The spore drive
just disengaged, sir.

40:10.669 --> 40:12.845
What's going on down there?

40:12.888 --> 40:15.325
It appears to be a failure
in the spore hub.

40:15.369 --> 40:17.327
Sir, I'm seeing corruption
in duotronics.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.633
Corruption that seems
to have been

40:18.677 --> 40:20.113
introduced manually
somehow.

40:20.156 --> 40:21.897
Have there been previous
corruption issues with the hub?

40:21.941 --> 40:23.377
Not like this.

40:23.421 --> 40:24.944
We run level-three diagnostics

40:24.987 --> 40:26.511
on the entire spore drive
every ten hours.

40:28.426 --> 40:31.167
Someone deliberately
corrupted the system.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.737
Why the black alert?We have to get
to Talos IV

40:35.781 --> 40:37.347
to retrieve Spock
and Burnham.

40:37.391 --> 40:39.088
But our spore drive
has conveniently gone down,

40:39.132 --> 40:41.090
and it wasn't an accident.

40:41.134 --> 40:42.352
You think someone
tampered with it?

40:42.396 --> 40:43.658
Who? Who would do that?

40:43.702 --> 40:45.704
Well, we might be able
to narrow down the list

40:45.747 --> 40:48.576
by asking who had a vested
interest in keeping us here.

40:48.620 --> 40:50.665
SARU: And someone on our ship
has been sending

40:50.709 --> 40:53.712
unauthorized, heavily encrypted
subspace transmissions

40:53.755 --> 40:55.931
to unidentified
recipients.

40:55.975 --> 40:57.846
I don't know anything about

40:57.890 --> 40:59.631
unauthorized transmissions.SARU: Odd.

40:59.674 --> 41:02.764
They were authorized
by your command codes.

41:07.029 --> 41:08.553
I sent nothing.

41:09.771 --> 41:11.991
To no one.
Someone must have

41:12.034 --> 41:14.602
spoofed my code.
And sabotaged
the spore drive.

41:14.646 --> 41:16.604
You don't really think I...I've recently
learned that

41:16.648 --> 41:19.607
Section 31 has accessed
invasive neurologic tech.

41:22.218 --> 41:24.046
Maybe they used it on you.

41:24.090 --> 41:26.875
Maybe you don't even
know you're doing it.

41:26.919 --> 41:29.225
That part of my life is over.

41:29.269 --> 41:31.837
I'm sure I-I'd know
if I did something like that.

41:31.880 --> 41:33.447
I'm sorry, Tyler.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.536
I can't afford to take
your word for it.

41:35.580 --> 41:37.233
And neither can you.

41:37.277 --> 41:38.539
Have him confined
to his quarters

41:38.583 --> 41:40.498
until further notice.

41:49.681 --> 41:51.291
Trust me on this,
if nothing else:

41:51.334 --> 41:53.162
Section 31 will find
a way to track you.

41:54.250 --> 41:56.514
Thank you, Mr. Tyler. I agree.

41:58.472 --> 41:59.691
Set a course
for Starbase 11

41:59.734 --> 42:01.344
at maximum warp.Aye, sir.

42:01.388 --> 42:02.563
Radio ahead.

42:02.607 --> 42:04.434
Say that
we need repairs.Aye, Captain.

42:04.478 --> 42:06.654
Maybe that'll throw off
any potential pursuers.

42:06.698 --> 42:09.091
Starbase 11 is two light-years
from Talos IV.

42:09.135 --> 42:10.615
Exactly why I want

42:10.658 --> 42:12.312
Section 31 to think
that we're going there.

42:12.355 --> 42:13.705
We'll pick a point midway,

42:13.748 --> 42:15.228
alter course
and then run silent.

42:16.490 --> 42:19.580
That should buy use enough time.

42:19.624 --> 42:20.581
I hope.

42:36.945 --> 42:38.686
BURNHAM:
Thank you...

42:38.730 --> 42:40.340
for helping Spock.

42:40.383 --> 42:42.603
I'm pretty sure
he would have died

42:42.647 --> 42:43.822
without your help.

42:47.652 --> 42:49.915
Discoverywill be here soon.

42:49.958 --> 42:51.612
There isn't much time.

42:51.656 --> 42:53.527
I owe them my memory.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.573
You don't want them
to force payment.

42:55.616 --> 42:56.748
It's awful.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.619
SPOCK: I've shown her
all the memories

42:58.663 --> 43:00.447
she needs to see.

43:04.233 --> 43:05.495
Yeah, well...

43:07.541 --> 43:09.238
...now you have to share
one of mine.

43:09.282 --> 43:12.198
It's the price I agreed to
for your recovery.

43:20.815 --> 43:22.338
YOUNG SPOCK:
Michael, wait.

43:23.775 --> 43:25.472
Michael, wait.

43:27.430 --> 43:29.607
Where are you going?

43:29.650 --> 43:31.696
Spock, I'm a danger
to your family.

43:31.739 --> 43:34.742
Our family. No.

43:34.786 --> 43:35.917
There are too many Vulcans

43:35.961 --> 43:37.832
who don't want
humans living here.

43:37.876 --> 43:40.356
Father knows the
separatists aren't gone.

43:40.400 --> 43:43.185
They'll come back
and attack your home.

43:43.229 --> 43:44.926
Our home.

43:44.970 --> 43:46.449
We'll fight them.

43:46.493 --> 43:47.755
Together.

43:47.799 --> 43:49.452
It's better this way.

43:50.802 --> 43:53.413
You deserve to grow up
somewhere safe.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.110
Safe is a relative construct.

43:55.154 --> 43:57.025
Safe has inconsistent meanings.

43:57.069 --> 43:58.853
Stop it.

43:58.897 --> 44:00.550
I am going.

44:00.594 --> 44:01.943
Then I'm going with you.

44:06.731 --> 44:08.646
I don't want you with me.

44:10.909 --> 44:12.519
Don't you understand that?

44:12.562 --> 44:15.087
You are my sister.

44:15.130 --> 44:16.828
My sister...

44:16.871 --> 44:19.657
You... you are helping the human
part of me learn to express...

44:19.700 --> 44:21.441
The human part of
you is so small

44:21.484 --> 44:23.661
it won't make a difference
in your life.

44:23.704 --> 44:25.140
Why can't you get it
through your head?

44:25.184 --> 44:27.447
I don't want a freak
like you as a brother.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.928
But I love you.
Love?

44:29.971 --> 44:31.712
You're not capable of love.

44:31.756 --> 44:33.540
I am.No, you are not.

44:33.583 --> 44:35.803
You are Vulcan,

44:35.847 --> 44:38.806
and you will always be
cold and distant,

44:38.850 --> 44:41.896
like a moon somewhere.

44:41.940 --> 44:44.856
You're not worth my effort.

44:44.899 --> 44:47.075
But you promised you would
teach me the ways of Earth.

44:47.119 --> 44:50.296
That maybe we could
live there one day.Don't you get it?

44:50.339 --> 44:53.734
I don't want you in my life.

44:53.778 --> 44:56.389
Stop following me...

44:58.130 --> 45:00.959
...you weird little half-breed.

45:20.021 --> 45:21.849
Spock, I didn't mean
any of those...

45:21.893 --> 45:23.459
I am aware you were
trying to sever

45:23.503 --> 45:25.070
our emotional connection
so that I would be

45:25.113 --> 45:26.985
less distraught
by your absence.

45:27.028 --> 45:29.161
A primitive tactic,
but logical.

45:29.204 --> 45:30.858
No, it was more than that.

45:30.902 --> 45:32.730
The Logic Extremists
would have targeted our family

45:32.773 --> 45:34.644
as long as I was
still in that house.

45:34.688 --> 45:37.430
I did not want you
to get hurt or killed.

45:39.301 --> 45:42.130
But I should have
tried something else.

45:43.741 --> 45:44.959
Anything else.

45:45.003 --> 45:47.179
Spock,

45:47.222 --> 45:50.660
I am so sorry.

45:50.704 --> 45:54.055
In point of fact,
I am grateful.

45:54.099 --> 45:56.188
Your words showed me
how damaging

45:56.231 --> 45:57.624
my humanity could be.

45:57.667 --> 46:00.061
No, your humanity
was beautiful.

46:01.367 --> 46:02.847
I was a child.

46:02.890 --> 46:05.197
You were a catalyst.

46:05.240 --> 46:08.069
In an attempt to
escape emotion,

46:08.113 --> 46:09.331
to escape you,

46:09.375 --> 46:11.812
I fully submerged in logic.

46:11.856 --> 46:13.945
But my bedrock of
logic, my constant,

46:13.988 --> 46:16.599
has always been time itself.

46:16.643 --> 46:18.427
And now time has failed me.

46:18.471 --> 46:20.647
Logic has failed me.

46:20.690 --> 46:22.388
Emotion has failed me.

46:24.085 --> 46:26.435
I have nothing to build upon,
yet build I must.

46:28.046 --> 46:29.787
This could be
the defining moment

46:29.830 --> 46:31.963
for multiple civilizations
and millions of lives,

46:32.006 --> 46:33.442
and I am not ready.

46:33.486 --> 46:37.403
Are you more angry
with me or yourself?

46:37.446 --> 46:39.927
Do not attempt to
psychoanalyze me, Michael.

46:39.971 --> 46:43.017
Better minds than yours
have tried and failed.

46:43.061 --> 46:45.106
Yet you chose me
for this journey.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.456
You value our connection.

46:47.500 --> 46:50.372
Perhaps the bedrock
of your logic

46:50.416 --> 46:52.157
is this relationship.

46:52.200 --> 46:53.201
Absurd.

46:53.245 --> 46:54.812
You are correct,
however,

46:54.855 --> 46:56.030
on one matter.

46:56.074 --> 46:59.120
It was foolish to idolize you.

46:59.164 --> 47:01.819
And I regret it deeply.

47:06.171 --> 47:07.694
VINA:
Discovery'sapproaching.

47:07.737 --> 47:10.088
There is another ship
close behind.

47:11.916 --> 47:14.135
They want you to know
you're in danger.

47:24.929 --> 47:26.887
The Section 31 ship
is hailing, sir.

47:26.931 --> 47:29.020
Tyler's confined.
They didn't find us through him.

47:29.063 --> 47:30.325
Answer them, Bryce.

47:31.413 --> 47:33.372
I know where you're going, Pike.

47:33.415 --> 47:36.549
Cut your engines immediately.
That's an order.

47:36.592 --> 47:38.681
I'll start following orders when
you start telling the truth.

47:38.725 --> 47:40.466
Or did you not think
I'd find out

47:40.509 --> 47:42.033
what you were going
to do to Spock?

47:42.076 --> 47:43.251
LELAND:
Last warning, Chris.

47:43.295 --> 47:45.514
Stand down.

47:48.126 --> 47:50.128
Detmer, drop us in
over Talos IV.

47:50.171 --> 47:52.826
Owo, the second we're in range,
start scanning for our people.

47:58.353 --> 47:59.920
Got them, sir.PIKE: Beam them up, quickly.

47:59.964 --> 48:01.313
Copy that, sir.

48:01.356 --> 48:04.098
Achieving lock,
and beaming now.

48:05.752 --> 48:07.188
And?

48:07.232 --> 48:08.798
I've locked on
with our transporter,

48:08.842 --> 48:11.192
but I'm getting interference.TILLY: Sir, Section 31

48:11.236 --> 48:12.890
has a lock
on Burnham and Spock as well.

48:12.933 --> 48:14.587
Leland again, sir.

48:14.630 --> 48:17.024
Put him on.

48:17.068 --> 48:18.983
Pike, disengage your
transporter beam immediately.

48:19.026 --> 48:21.289
I can't do that.If one of us doesn't let go,

48:21.333 --> 48:23.596
Burnham and Spock will be
ripped apart atom by atom.

48:23.639 --> 48:25.641
Is that what you want?
Because that's exactly

48:25.685 --> 48:27.078
what's going to happen
if you don't

48:27.121 --> 48:29.080
disengage your transporter beam.

48:29.123 --> 48:30.168
Mute screen.

48:30.211 --> 48:32.126
What do I do, sir?

48:35.216 --> 48:36.783
Captain?

48:42.484 --> 48:44.486
Let your friends go.

48:45.531 --> 48:47.707
It's the only way.

48:49.230 --> 48:51.058
Let them go.

48:52.277 --> 48:54.148
Let us all go.

48:56.498 --> 48:58.544
Trust me.

49:01.895 --> 49:04.115
Goodbye, Vina.

49:09.555 --> 49:12.210
Owo...

49:12.253 --> 49:13.646
disengage transporter.

49:17.780 --> 49:19.652
Yes, sir.

49:23.134 --> 49:25.397
They've disengaged.
Beaming in now.

49:31.794 --> 49:33.666
Do not move.

49:36.234 --> 49:37.975
You did the right thing.

49:38.018 --> 49:40.890
That will be noted
in my after-action report.

49:40.934 --> 49:44.590
Now, you and your crew
are to report to Starbase 11

49:44.633 --> 49:47.114
and await disciplinary action.

49:47.158 --> 49:48.507
Leland out.

49:52.815 --> 49:54.208
You look exceptionally
pleased with yourself.

49:54.252 --> 49:57.168
Aren't you surprised
Pike gave up so easily?

49:57.211 --> 49:59.213
Thank you
for your insight.

49:59.257 --> 50:02.042
Now, this time,
I'll do the talking.

50:03.478 --> 50:05.219
Captain, I detect a shuttle

50:05.263 --> 50:06.307
approaching
from the planet.

50:06.351 --> 50:08.092
OWOSEKUN: Trying to
scan it, Captain,

50:08.135 --> 50:09.571
but something is
blocking us.

50:09.615 --> 50:10.616
Should I hail them, sir?

50:10.659 --> 50:12.052
No.

50:12.096 --> 50:13.836
They wouldn't want
to risk answering.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.403
Let them in the shuttle bay.

50:15.447 --> 50:16.926
Mr. Saru, with me.

50:16.970 --> 50:18.363
LELAND:
Welcome back, Commander.

50:18.406 --> 50:20.060
What were you doing on Talos?

50:21.627 --> 50:23.716
This will go easier
if you answer me.

50:23.759 --> 50:25.457
Or it can go harder.

50:25.500 --> 50:26.501
I beg to differ.

50:28.721 --> 50:30.940
Say goodbye, Spock.

50:34.118 --> 50:35.945
Goodbye, Spock.

50:37.991 --> 50:40.254
What is this?
What's happening?

50:51.787 --> 50:53.746
BURNHAM:
Captain.

50:53.789 --> 50:55.661
Commander Saru.

50:55.704 --> 50:57.315
But how?

50:57.358 --> 51:00.927
Talosian projection.
That's how.

51:00.970 --> 51:02.189
Greetings, Captain.

51:02.233 --> 51:04.452
Spock.

51:06.150 --> 51:08.326
Are you all right?

51:08.369 --> 51:10.458
Much better for seeing you
in person, sir.

51:10.502 --> 51:13.635
Even if we are only
riding into danger.

51:15.159 --> 51:18.031
Is that a smile
I see on your face?

51:19.206 --> 51:22.383
I believe it is. Yes.

51:26.431 --> 51:30.435
Well, welcome to Discovery.

51:34.221 --> 51:36.136
Those Talosians tried
this trick with me

51:36.180 --> 51:37.659
in the Terran universe once,

51:37.703 --> 51:40.880
and I blew them
and their stupid singing plants

51:40.923 --> 51:42.664
off the face of the planet.

51:42.708 --> 51:44.057
Well, you might have
told me about

51:44.101 --> 51:45.667
the scope of their abilities.

51:45.711 --> 51:47.974
And miss seeing you explain
yourself to the admirals?

51:48.017 --> 51:51.412
Oh, Leland, I wonder how
this will work out for you.

51:57.375 --> 51:58.985
Captain on the bridge.

51:59.028 --> 52:00.552
Spock, I need to hear
about this Red Angel.

52:00.595 --> 52:02.206
Do you know what it is?

52:02.249 --> 52:03.598
A human, and nothing more.

52:03.642 --> 52:05.774
BURNHAM: It appears
this person is attempting

52:05.818 --> 52:08.125
to change the outcome
of our current timeline.

52:08.168 --> 52:09.256
And what is that outcome?

52:09.300 --> 52:10.910
A future in which
all sentient life

52:10.953 --> 52:12.346
in our galaxy
has been eradicated.

52:13.478 --> 52:15.088
By what?

52:15.132 --> 52:16.220
Unclear, Captain.

52:16.263 --> 52:17.569
Well, we should sure
alter course

52:17.612 --> 52:19.310
and get the hell out of here.

52:19.353 --> 52:21.355
In just a few minutes. Discoverywill become

52:21.399 --> 52:23.270
the most wanted ship
in the galaxy.

52:23.314 --> 52:25.446
I don't suppose the Red Angel
offered you any advice

52:25.490 --> 52:27.361
on how to handle a
situation like this.

52:27.405 --> 52:29.102
No.

52:29.146 --> 52:30.451
But my limited
experience

52:30.495 --> 52:32.758
as a fugitive suggests
only one course of action.

52:32.801 --> 52:34.107
And what is that?

52:34.151 --> 52:35.717
We run.

52:40.853 --> 52:42.463
PIKE:
I can't ask any of you

52:42.507 --> 52:45.553
to participate in what is
clearly an act of disobedience.

52:45.597 --> 52:47.686
Course heading, sir?TILLY: Does feel like

52:47.729 --> 52:49.644
we should get moving, like, now.

52:54.040 --> 52:55.998
I think you have
the crew, sir.

52:56.042 --> 52:58.436
Helm, get us out of here.
