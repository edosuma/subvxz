00:44.240 --> 00:46.515
Nice playing, Will.

00:46.600 --> 00:48.158
Thanks.

01:13.360 --> 01:15.157
How you getting up there?

01:15.240 --> 01:17.993
- Going by bus.
- How long's that?

01:18.080 --> 01:21.470
It's... five, six hours.

01:21.560 --> 01:25.189
- How about some food?
- No, I'm good. I'll see you.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.676
- One to Knight's Ridge.
- One-way or round trip?

02:02.760 --> 02:06.753
- One-way. How much is that?
- $48.

02:16.320 --> 02:18.276
There you go.

02:18.960 --> 02:23.511
OK. Gate 62. That way and turn right.
Have a good trip.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.112
That's it.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.349
Oh, shit.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.598
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:14.680 --> 04:18.070
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.758
No 'buca. What's the matter?
No Sambuca this time?

04:22.840 --> 04:26.879
- It's five in the morning, Kev.
- Is that too late or too early?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.518
You guys done for the night?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.556
- Yeah.
- Big storm.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.875
- I didn't have any styrofoam.
- That's OK. I'll bring 'em back.

04:39.560 --> 04:41.551
- OK.
- OK.

04:42.720 --> 04:44.438
- Bye, Kev.
- Yeah.

04:45.520 --> 04:47.431
- I'll see you.
- Bye.

04:57.880 --> 05:01.111
- What?
- The styrofoam thing creases me.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.873
- What are you talking about?
- First storm,

05:03.960 --> 05:08.431
you'd think she'd get
some styrofoam cups for, like, $1.99.

05:08.520 --> 05:12.752
- I'll return the mugs this time.
- Shut your fucking hole.

05:14.680 --> 05:17.638
- The chick's married, Tommy.
- No shit.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.549
- She's not home.
- Where is she?

06:08.640 --> 06:11.518
- Banging that guy.
- Buddy, she's sleeping.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.670
I'll bet $20 she's banging that guy.

06:13.760 --> 06:16.433
- Bad bet.
- Bad bet? Why?

06:16.520 --> 06:19.512
Either way, you lose.
If you win, she's bangin' him.

06:19.600 --> 06:22.876
If you lose, you lose 20 bucks.
Not a smart bet.

06:22.960 --> 06:26.475
- I can't believe her.
- You really think she is?

06:26.560 --> 06:28.596
- I know.
- The meat cutter?

06:28.680 --> 06:31.353
Yes. The fucking meat cutter.

06:31.440 --> 06:33.670
What future can she have?
He cuts meat!

06:33.760 --> 06:37.150
- You plough snow.
- At least meat you can eat.

06:38.960 --> 06:41.793
- Why is he here?
- He's an employee.

06:43.680 --> 06:47.309
All right. I'm outta here.
I'll see you at home.

06:47.400 --> 06:49.868
- Don't go by Jan's.
- I'm not.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.632
- Hey.
- You sand my lots?

06:51.720 --> 06:56.748
- Yeah. Don't go by there.
- I'm not. Just get my lots.

06:59.280 --> 07:02.989
- He's going by there.
- Without a doubt.

07:05.440 --> 07:09.877
- Do I got anything in my 'stache?
- You're clean.

08:05.560 --> 08:06.834
Willie!

08:06.920 --> 08:10.674
- Willie!
- Hey, Mo!

08:11.760 --> 08:15.389
- How you doing, man?
- All right. Good to see you.

08:15.480 --> 08:19.678
- Good to be back?
- I've been back four minutes.

08:19.760 --> 08:25.153
- You remember Cheryl and Michael Jr?
- Wow, Mo, they're...

08:25.240 --> 08:26.559
cute.

08:26.960 --> 08:31.511
- Yeah. You still seeing that chick?
- What do you mean by seeing?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.591
- You're not engaged?
- No.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.830
Well, it's been... what, a year?

08:36.919 --> 08:39.878
11 months, living together for six.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.198
- She hasn't put pressure on you?
- Depends what you mean by pressure.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.071
Hey, kids.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.357
- Hey, you psyched for the reunion?
- Oh, yeah.

08:59.440 --> 09:03.353
- It's great to be back.
- The gang back together.

09:03.440 --> 09:06.398
- Everybody's coming?
- Oh, yeah, everybody.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.160
I can't wait to show you the house.

09:24.240 --> 09:27.118
Come over for brunch.
Sarah'll make her waffles.

09:27.200 --> 09:31.273
- Great. Thanks for the ride.
- No problem. You OK with this?

09:31.360 --> 09:33.032
Yeah, I'm OK. I'm fine.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.430
I'm glad you're home, man.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.273
- All right, see you.
- See you soon.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.271
- See you, kids.
- Bye!

09:41.360 --> 09:45.273
- Hey, kids. Who wants ice cream?
- Me!

10:19.760 --> 10:20.875
Hello, Dad.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.470
- When did you get in?
- Just now. Mo picked me up.

10:28.680 --> 10:33.708
- Got a lot of bags. Staying long?
- I don't know.

10:39.400 --> 10:45.475
There's golf on TV.
Would you like to watch some golf?

10:47.520 --> 10:49.192
Sure.

10:50.880 --> 10:57.479
Why don't you put your bags upstairs
and come down and watch some golf?

10:57.560 --> 10:59.312
Yeah. Yeah.

11:35.200 --> 11:36.599
Hey!

11:36.680 --> 11:38.716
Oh, man!

11:41.200 --> 11:44.988
- You just getting up?
- Oh, yeah, man.

11:45.080 --> 11:48.470
- Wild night. I got wrecked.
- Yeah?

11:50.880 --> 11:55.670
- You gonna be home long?
- I don't know. We'll see.

11:57.520 --> 12:00.990
- You see Dad?
- Yeah. We're gonna watch some golf.

12:04.520 --> 12:08.354
- You missed a hell of a storm.
- Yeah.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.155
Hey, when did the Ryans move out?

12:13.240 --> 12:16.357
Ryans? I don't know. Last year.

12:16.440 --> 12:18.351
Who moved in?

12:19.680 --> 12:21.033
I don't know.

12:21.120 --> 12:24.635
- They got a kid?
- Do they? I don't know.

12:24.720 --> 12:27.188
Yeah, I think so. They got a kid.

12:31.280 --> 12:33.430
Yeah, I'm gonna take a dump, man.

12:58.560 --> 13:01.233
- Hey! Willie C! What's up?
- Paulie.

13:01.320 --> 13:04.278
- You remember Elle MacPherson?
- How you doin'?

13:04.360 --> 13:06.078
Jan's banging some meat cutter.

13:06.160 --> 13:10.233
- It started a month ago.
- I heard you got the ultimatum.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.312
Fuck that.
What right does she have to do that?

13:13.400 --> 13:17.359
- You've been going out seven years.
- So what's the big deal?

13:17.440 --> 13:20.876
- How old is Jan?
- Don't start with me...

13:20.960 --> 13:24.430
- She's 27.
- 27. Maybe she wants to have kids.

13:24.520 --> 13:28.195
So what? I wanna have kids, too,
but what's the rush?

13:28.280 --> 13:31.477
Kathy Lee Gifford just had a kid
and she's 45.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.836
- So who's this guy?
- Victor the meat cutter.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.833
You ready to puke? This guy's 40,
divorced and has three kids.

13:38.920 --> 13:41.832
So there's no way
she's getting sperm from him.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.956
Exactly. I knew you'd understand.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.157
You wanna know what really
creases me? Jan's a vegetarian.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.674
- Right.
- You see the hypocrisy?

13:49.760 --> 13:52.558
Jan's a vegetarian.
He's a meat cutter.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.709
Oh, wow!

13:53.800 --> 13:56.758
How can she live
with a man who stinks of brisket?

13:56.840 --> 13:59.957
Show time is 12:30
here on Sports Central.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.270
- You're saying six...?
- Six speakers.

14:02.360 --> 14:05.113
- Hey, look who's here.
- Hey! What's up?

14:05.200 --> 14:07.794
- Hey!
- It's Sharon. She's sleeping.

14:07.880 --> 14:10.235
Listen, I'll see you in a minute.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.197
All right.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.392
- Hey.
- Yeah?

14:15.480 --> 14:18.597
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

14:26.640 --> 14:27.834
Jesus.

14:27.920 --> 14:30.309
You still seeing that chick?
The lawyer?

14:30.400 --> 14:33.392
- Tracy, yeah.
- Tracy? What's goin' on?

14:33.480 --> 14:35.118
- She's great.
- And?

14:35.200 --> 14:36.952
- What?
- What's the deal?

14:37.040 --> 14:41.636
- We're going through this stage...
- They're all sisters. Trust me.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.915
It's one big conspiracy.
Leave it alone.

14:45.000 --> 14:48.197
- You been playing piano?
- Yeah. Nothing steady.

14:48.280 --> 14:50.635
- Good money?
- How they doing?

14:50.720 --> 14:53.439
All he ever thinks about
is Darian Smalls.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.876
- Come on! Still?
- Nothing changes around here, Will.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.157
Every time Sharon sees Birdy
thinking about Darian,

15:00.240 --> 15:03.152
it's another pound
when she looks in the mirror.

15:03.240 --> 15:04.593
Have you seen her?

15:04.680 --> 15:08.798
She's like one of those kids
Sally Struthers feeds paste to.

15:08.880 --> 15:10.791
- We need models.
- What?

15:10.880 --> 15:15.237
They're beautiful, rich, you don't
have to spend much time with them.

15:15.320 --> 15:17.709
Fuckers that date models,
they got it made.

15:17.800 --> 15:21.031
My next girlfriend's
gonna be a six-foot-tall model.

15:21.120 --> 15:22.314
Definitely.

15:24.000 --> 15:24.955
A big one.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.270
- Models.
- I like those chicks.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.951
Don't shovel much, do you?

15:47.760 --> 15:51.799
- What makes you say that?
- Your technique, it's sloppy.

15:51.880 --> 15:56.510
- You live in a city or warm climate.
- City.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.952
You grew up here?

16:02.080 --> 16:03.399
Yeah. Yeah.

16:03.480 --> 16:06.438
- Don't visit much?
- Nope.

16:07.800 --> 16:10.951
- Mom dead?
- You a cop?

16:11.760 --> 16:13.432
No.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.675
Yeah, my mother's dead.

16:21.280 --> 16:24.033
I knew it. Your dad's
kind of a sad guy.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.511
Your brother is kind of missing that
thing that having a mom gives you.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.511
It's a lonely house you got.

16:35.320 --> 16:36.673
What's your name?

16:37.720 --> 16:39.915
- Marty.
- As in Martha?

16:40.000 --> 16:43.993
As in Marty, named for a grandfather
I never even knew - Martin.

16:44.080 --> 16:47.516
So now I'm Marty.
Just Marty. A girl named Marty.

16:47.600 --> 16:49.670
It is the bane of my existence.

16:52.080 --> 16:55.959
- How old are you?
- 13, but I'm an old soul.

16:57.080 --> 16:59.435
So why did you come back?

16:59.520 --> 17:01.317
Well...

17:04.800 --> 17:06.869
My high school reunion.

17:06.960 --> 17:08.915
- Heavy.
- Yeah.

17:10.240 --> 17:13.117
- So what's your name?
- Willie.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.998
Willie, I like your 'burns.

17:17.599 --> 17:18.749
Thanks.

17:18.839 --> 17:23.196
- You're kinda cool.
- How do you mean?

17:24.720 --> 17:29.840
I don't know. It's just a call.
You don't think you are?

17:29.920 --> 17:31.069
I...

17:32.360 --> 17:33.634
I, um...

17:34.280 --> 17:36.350
No, I... I think I am.

17:37.320 --> 17:39.629
You are... I think.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.473
- Yeah?
- Maybe not.

17:45.320 --> 17:47.117
I'm gonna go.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.873
Yeah, I'll see you around...

17:50.960 --> 17:52.632
Marty.

17:57.680 --> 18:02.356
Are you Victor?
Excuse me, is your name Victor?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.396
See who's here?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.755
- Shit.
- Are you Victor?

18:06.840 --> 18:08.956
I'm looking for Victor
the meat cutter.

18:09.040 --> 18:12.430
I hit a cow
and he could slice me some steaks.

18:12.520 --> 18:16.069
- It's a waste to let it rot.
- You're not funny.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.515
I'm serious, Jan.

18:18.600 --> 18:23.515
I don't appreciate you burying my
driveway like some obsessed lunatic.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.830
- OK. That's fair.
- What do you want?

18:29.920 --> 18:32.354
- I wanna give you this.
- What is that?

18:32.440 --> 18:34.590
- It's a rump roast. Come on.
- Paul...

18:34.680 --> 18:36.716
Come on. At least open it.

18:36.800 --> 18:41.430
- I really don't think I should.
- Do you believe this?

18:43.320 --> 18:46.835
See what a man
has to go through for love?

18:48.640 --> 18:51.712
It's beautiful, Paul. It's lovely.

18:53.320 --> 18:57.552
- It's brown.
- Champagne. It's the newest thing.

18:57.640 --> 18:58.868
It's not brown.

18:58.960 --> 19:02.430
- Champagne? It's beautiful.
- Thank you.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.431
- So what are you doing?
- I can't take it.

19:08.520 --> 19:09.953
- Why not?
- I can't.

19:10.040 --> 19:11.678
- Marry me, Jan.
- No.

19:13.240 --> 19:16.232
- "No"? Just like that, "no"?
- No.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.668
- Jesus Christ, Jan!
- You're so selfish.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.593
Selfish? Let me explain something.

19:22.680 --> 19:27.754
What's in this box constitutes
30 driveways. Selfish? I think not.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.434
We're taking some time.
This screws everything up.

19:30.520 --> 19:34.069
- Paul. What are you doing?
- Chip, cut me some slack.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.913
- You're making a spectacle.
- It's her fault.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.560
Jan? Outside.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.595
- Look, take this ring.
- I got customers, Paul.

19:49.680 --> 19:51.398
- Jan.
- Paul.

19:51.480 --> 19:52.913
Take the fucking ring!

19:53.000 --> 19:55.878
- That's romantic!
- You sucked the romance out.

19:55.960 --> 19:58.554
This is the desperate act
of a desperate man.

19:58.640 --> 20:01.916
Only when faced with losing me
do you decide to do this.

20:02.000 --> 20:06.391
So? I didn't like the alternative.
That's how one comes to a decision.

20:06.480 --> 20:10.155
Wrong. One comes to a decision
based on what one wants,

20:10.240 --> 20:12.276
not what one doesn't want, got it?

20:16.280 --> 20:18.510
I got customers.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.590
So how's everything at home?

20:25.680 --> 20:28.831
It's all right. It's a little weird.

20:28.920 --> 20:32.356
Dad's parked in front of the TV
all the time

20:32.440 --> 20:36.228
and my mom's clothes
are still hanging in the closet.

20:36.320 --> 20:42.077
- So what did you do Christmas?
- The tiki lounge gets real busy.

20:42.160 --> 20:46.119
- Come on. What did you do?
- Went to Pennsylvania with Tracy.

20:46.200 --> 20:48.156
- Met her parents.
- Was it good?

20:48.240 --> 20:50.390
- It was all right.
- Right.

20:51.800 --> 20:52.994
How's Sharon?

20:54.200 --> 20:57.351
Sharon? She's OK, you know?

20:57.440 --> 21:00.671
Well, she's actually not that good,
you know...

21:00.760 --> 21:04.878
What about the other thing,
the other situation?

21:04.960 --> 21:07.235
Oh, Darian? It's over.

21:07.320 --> 21:11.757
- It's over?
- I mean it's practically over.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.637
Wait, it's "practically" over?

21:13.720 --> 21:17.429
Well, I mean it's... practically over.
It's over.

21:17.520 --> 21:21.991
Listen, how come you never came down
that weekend? I had the whole thing.

21:22.080 --> 21:26.915
You know, I got busy and...
I had to stick around, but...

21:27.000 --> 21:29.798
What about spring?
I'll come see you this spring.

21:29.880 --> 21:32.553
Now I know
what I'm doing this spring.

21:37.040 --> 21:39.838
Hey, Stinky Womack re-opened
The Johnson Inn.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.275
You wanna go by, maybe,

21:42.360 --> 21:45.432
- grab a beer or something?
- Yeah. Great.

22:02.560 --> 22:06.439
- Hey, what's up, Tommy? Who's that?
- Hey, Stinky!

22:06.520 --> 22:08.238
Hey, Willie!

22:08.320 --> 22:12.472
Hey, watch the Stinky stuff.
I'm a proprietor now.

22:12.560 --> 22:15.438
- Sorry, Stinky. Nice job!
- Yeah, huh?

22:15.520 --> 22:19.957
We got a new bar,
little fireplace, menu, apps.

22:20.040 --> 22:24.352
- Apps?
- Yeah. Appetisers. We got apps.

22:24.440 --> 22:26.829
He's the proprietor.
He's got the lingo down.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.319
Willie! Willie C!

22:32.200 --> 22:33.918
- What's up?
- What's up?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.514
You all right?

22:36.600 --> 22:38.591
Scoot over.

22:38.680 --> 22:41.911
- What's got him creased?
- This.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.389
- What is it?
- It's a diamond.

22:48.800 --> 22:53.351
- Fuckin' thing's brown.
- It's champagne, the newest thing.

22:53.440 --> 22:55.590
- What?
- It's a trend.

22:55.680 --> 22:58.717
- Frank, two beers.
- You're so uncultured.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.870
Champagne. It's a nice stone, Paul.

23:00.960 --> 23:05.351
I heard about this. They're trying
to create a new market.

23:05.440 --> 23:10.230
Oh, right, yeah. They were calling it
"piss" but weren't moving any units.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.151
- What's with you?
- What?

23:12.240 --> 23:15.915
- How much did you pay?
- What difference does it make?

23:16.000 --> 23:18.468
What difference?
Diamonds are colourless.

23:18.560 --> 23:22.758
You buy a coloured diamond
for a girl you're not even seeing.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.877
- You been eating retard sandwiches.
- I don't need your shit.

23:25.960 --> 23:30.476
- I think you do.
- Fuck you, Mr High Horse.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.915
You're like a human Geraldo episode.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.355
- What does that mean?
- Guys...

23:35.440 --> 23:39.115
You got one broad destroying her
marriage, one destroying her stomach.

23:39.200 --> 23:42.033
- You just watch hockey.
- Don't push it.

23:42.120 --> 23:45.669
What are you gonna do?
Beat me up after class?

23:45.760 --> 23:48.638
This ain't high school any more.
The legend's dead.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.439
- The legend can still fuck you up.
- Bullshit!

23:51.520 --> 23:53.431
- Paul...
- Butt out, Conway.

23:53.520 --> 23:56.512
Don't waltz in here
with your big city bullshit.

23:56.600 --> 23:58.192
- Fucking loser.
- Faggot.

23:58.280 --> 23:59.872
- Prick.
- Asshole.

23:59.960 --> 24:03.396
Free apps! I got free apps.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.393
What?

24:12.160 --> 24:13.309
Hey!

24:15.240 --> 24:16.593
Willie boy.

24:18.280 --> 24:21.716
- What are you doin'?
- Hanging out.

24:21.800 --> 24:27.158
I like to mash snow, it gives me
a sense of self-satisfaction.

24:30.320 --> 24:33.790
- You got a girlfriend?
- Why do you ask?

24:34.920 --> 24:38.469
I don't know. You're a dude in flux.

24:38.560 --> 24:42.473
You've come back to the house
of loneliness and tears,

24:42.560 --> 24:47.793
to daddy downer and brother bummer,
to come to some decision about life.

24:47.880 --> 24:50.155
A life decision, if you will.

24:50.240 --> 24:53.710
You fancy yourself a perceptive
little thing, don't you?

24:53.800 --> 24:57.588
I don't know about "little".
I'm the tallest girl in my class.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.636
I may grow to be 5' 10".

25:01.840 --> 25:03.796
I'll be hot.

25:04.840 --> 25:06.273
Well...

25:06.360 --> 25:10.717
Am I right? Life decision? You
got the full-on Hamlet thing going?

25:10.800 --> 25:13.917
Hamlet? Danish prince,
couldn't make decisions.

25:14.000 --> 25:15.274
Yeah, I know Hamlet.

25:16.520 --> 25:19.239
So, about that girlfriend?

25:22.760 --> 25:24.591
Yeah. Yeah, there is one.

25:25.840 --> 25:29.515
- She want to get married?
- I think so.

25:29.600 --> 25:31.556
- You don't?
- I'm not sure.

25:31.640 --> 25:35.872
- Is she fat?
- No! She's quite nice actually.

25:35.960 --> 25:40.431
- So why don't you marry her?
- I knew I came for a reason!

25:40.520 --> 25:42.351
Thank you.

25:42.440 --> 25:46.194
- That's OK. Tease the little kid.
- See you around.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.357
See ya.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.999
Sharon?

26:00.080 --> 26:02.799
Sharon? What?

26:02.880 --> 26:08.034
It would be nice if when we were
making love, you'd be thinking of me.

26:08.120 --> 26:11.351
- Huh?
- She's not gonna leave him, Tommy.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.512
I don't know what you're talking
about. I haven't seen her in months.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.511
I am not stupid.

26:21.120 --> 26:23.395
So you wanna end this?

26:23.480 --> 26:27.029
That'd be convenient.
Save you the guilt? I end it?

26:30.520 --> 26:34.035
Let me ask you something.
What do I do?

26:34.120 --> 26:37.954
The best years
of your life were high school,

26:38.040 --> 26:42.397
when you were the king of the hill
and Darian was your girlfriend.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.597
You want all that back.
I can't give that to you.

26:45.680 --> 26:50.435
How do I compete with a life that
is impossible for you to have again?

26:53.680 --> 26:57.639
You're gonna have to break up
with him now.

26:57.720 --> 27:01.952
Getting over him, that's the hard
part. I know. Believe me, I know.

27:03.080 --> 27:06.470
She's right.
At first, you'll have these visions

27:06.560 --> 27:12.237
of you alone, 57, 58,
walking around, your hair in a bun -

27:12.320 --> 27:15.232
maybe you're a librarian -
heating up soup for one

27:15.320 --> 27:17.993
and worrying
about the cobwebs in your womb.

27:18.080 --> 27:22.198
- Gina.
- The visions fade, that's my point.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.078
You will get over him
in about two years.

27:25.160 --> 27:29.551
You'll be 29. It'd be better
if you were 24 now, then you'd be 26,

27:29.640 --> 27:31.596
but we don't choose these things.

27:31.680 --> 27:35.593
- They choose us.
- Exactly. So, 29.

27:35.680 --> 27:38.319
- That's not exactly ancient.
- Not exactly 30.

27:38.400 --> 27:40.789
- Which is good.
- Which is very good.

27:41.640 --> 27:47.272
Look, I know what you're saying
and I know how bad it looks,

27:47.360 --> 27:54.869
but nobody knows what it's like
when it's just the two of us.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.791
I love him.

27:56.880 --> 28:00.953
OK. No, that's fair.

28:01.880 --> 28:03.916
So how is it?

28:05.960 --> 28:11.751
- Lately, it's not so good.
- The man can't commit.

28:11.840 --> 28:13.193
The man can't commit.

28:14.280 --> 28:17.113
Why is it
when a relationship doesn't work out,

28:17.200 --> 28:20.590
we say it's cos they can't commit?

28:20.680 --> 28:24.593
- Shouldn't I take some of the blame?
- No. That is grief talking.

28:24.680 --> 28:28.309
- No way is that Sharon.
- It's a little grief-stricken girl

28:28.400 --> 28:30.436
who looks a lot like Sharon.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.988
I'm still not sure they're broken up.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.913
You're broken up, right?

28:37.640 --> 28:41.428
I don't know.
It's Tommy's birthday next week.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.909
It's on Saturday. I mean...

28:44.000 --> 28:47.390
Maybe if I threw him a party
with all his friends

28:47.480 --> 28:50.597
and we just had a nice time,
just relaxed...

28:51.680 --> 28:55.150
Would you guys help me organise it?

28:56.680 --> 28:58.033
Would you, please?

29:09.800 --> 29:11.279
One more.

29:11.920 --> 29:13.194
One more.

29:32.240 --> 29:36.870
Michael and my father, they both fall
off the boat, right into the lake.

29:36.960 --> 29:40.475
- It was classic.
- He got the picture, though.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.357
It's good.

29:42.440 --> 29:47.389
- So you been working much?
- A few nights, you know.

29:47.480 --> 29:50.995
But I'm actually toying
with the idea of becoming a citizen.

29:51.080 --> 29:53.196
Oh, what do you mean?

29:53.280 --> 29:59.469
Well, I got offered this sales job.
It's got a pretty good base salary,

29:59.560 --> 30:04.509
plus commission and...
I don't know. They'll let me know.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.353
- That sounds great.
- Yeah, it could be.

30:07.440 --> 30:08.919
Yeah.

30:10.080 --> 30:13.436
You... I'm gonna go get the video.

30:13.520 --> 30:17.638
- Of this? See him fall in... Yeah.
- You're gonna love it.

30:20.760 --> 30:22.159
What?

30:23.040 --> 30:25.952
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

30:26.040 --> 30:27.632
- That's bogus.
- Why?

30:27.720 --> 30:31.474
Cos you get that job, you won't have
any time to play the piano.

30:31.560 --> 30:35.473
Mo, listen, it's not happening.
It's just not happening.

30:35.560 --> 30:38.632
I'm getting older
and I gotta think about the future.

30:38.720 --> 30:41.553
You would be
the worst salesman ever, OK?

30:41.640 --> 30:45.349
I deal with salesmen every day
and you... you are no salesman.

30:45.440 --> 30:48.477
Well, thanks
for the vote of confidence.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.438
What the hell do you know
about office equipment?

30:51.520 --> 30:55.195
What do you know about kids?
You're raising two just fine.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.230
- Dad!
- Sarah?

31:05.680 --> 31:10.231
See these guys?
Husky Pete, Rizzo and Sammy Bean?

31:10.320 --> 31:15.872
They work all day, drink all night
for 40 fucking years.

31:15.960 --> 31:19.032
Two weeks out of the year,
they take a vacation.

31:19.120 --> 31:24.069
What do they do?
Drink all day and drink all night.

31:24.160 --> 31:28.676
Does this little observation
contain anything resembling a point?

31:28.760 --> 31:29.829
Yes, Tom.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.719
If we don't step it up,
we'll wind up just like Husky Pete

31:34.800 --> 31:37.314
and Rizzo and Sammy Bean.

31:37.840 --> 31:39.114
Cool.

31:40.360 --> 31:41.918
Cool?

31:46.560 --> 31:48.471
Holy shit!

31:49.000 --> 31:51.673
- Hi, Frank.
- Hey!

31:53.040 --> 31:54.519
Oh, it's good to see you.

31:54.600 --> 31:57.353
- What is that?
- That is unbelievable.

31:57.440 --> 32:01.433
- Stink, who's the vixen?
- It's my cousin from Chicago.

32:01.520 --> 32:05.069
- No way.
- No way does she share your blood.

32:05.160 --> 32:09.551
Yes, she does, and she is not only
hot, she is also completely cool.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.757
- Unbelievable.
- Does she have a boyfriend?

32:12.840 --> 32:16.992
What do you think? A girl
like that's born with a boyfriend.

32:18.280 --> 32:20.919
I'm gonna go say hi to Stanley.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.436
- Stanley?
- Hey, you.

32:25.240 --> 32:28.471
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

32:28.560 --> 32:32.030
I got some friends
I want you to meet. Come here.

32:33.040 --> 32:35.110
Oh, man, this should be fun.

32:36.920 --> 32:41.118
Andera, this is Tommy...

32:41.200 --> 32:43.236
- Kev...
- Hi.

32:43.320 --> 32:45.436
- Paul...
- Hi.

32:45.520 --> 32:47.750
- Willie.
- Guys...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.592
- Hey, Stink.
- I'm sorry. And Mo.

32:49.680 --> 32:52.433
- Hi, Mo.
- Hi.

32:52.520 --> 32:54.795
Guys, Andera.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.192
Hi.

32:57.280 --> 32:59.919
I'll be here if you need me.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.992
So what part of Chicago you from?

33:03.080 --> 33:08.359
- Do you know Chicago?
- Yeah... I know Soldier's Field.

33:08.440 --> 33:10.635
That's a football field.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.359
- She said it.
- So what do you do?

33:14.640 --> 33:19.998
- I'm in advertising.
- Advertising! That's great.

33:20.080 --> 33:23.390
- What do you guys do?
- What do we do?

33:23.480 --> 33:28.076
- Well, Paul and I have...
...a business.

33:28.160 --> 33:30.196
- Construction...
- Painting...

33:30.280 --> 33:33.670
- Kevin works for me.
- I work with him.

33:33.760 --> 33:37.036
- Mo works in a textile plant.
- I'm plant manager.

33:37.120 --> 33:39.076
And Willie here's a musician.

33:39.480 --> 33:42.836
- What do you play?
- Piano.

33:42.920 --> 33:45.309
- Would you play something?
- No, no...

33:45.400 --> 33:47.914
- Hey, Will, play something.
- No...

33:48.000 --> 33:49.479
Come on.

33:49.560 --> 33:52.233
- Come on. You never play any more.
- I know.

33:52.320 --> 33:54.276
- He's good.
- I need a shot.

33:54.360 --> 33:58.069
- Do you guys want to do a shot?
- Shots? We love shots.

33:58.160 --> 34:03.518
- Er, woo-woos, melon balls?
- Chicks like num-nums.

34:03.600 --> 34:07.832
- Whiskey.
- Whiskey, yeah. Whiskey it is.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.876
- Stan, six shorts.
- Who's Stan?

34:09.960 --> 34:12.110
You got it.

34:12.199 --> 34:14.270
Thank you.

34:14.360 --> 34:15.759
Gotcha.

34:15.840 --> 34:17.353
Irish.

34:18.960 --> 34:22.748
So, Willie,
you gonna play something or what?

34:24.239 --> 34:26.469
All right. All right.

34:26.560 --> 34:27.913
All right.

34:43.960 --> 34:45.109
Hey, buddy.

34:45.199 --> 34:48.397
Why'd you mention the piano?
We can't compete with that.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.914
Show her how you spread mulch.
That's sexy.

34:51.000 --> 34:54.594
Stinky's cousin. He's related!

35:10.040 --> 35:12.474
What's this song?

35:12.560 --> 35:14.391
You don't know this?

35:45.400 --> 35:46.753
Take it, buddy.

36:36.040 --> 36:39.396
I'm done speaking to both of you, OK?
You're both fucking insane.

36:39.480 --> 36:44.429
You know what your problem is? MTV,
Playboy and Madison fucking Avenue.

36:44.520 --> 36:46.795
Yes. Let me explain something to you.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.155
Girls with big tits have big asses.

36:49.240 --> 36:52.755
Girls with little tits have
little asses. That's how it goes.

36:52.840 --> 36:54.956
God doesn't fuck around. He's fair.

36:55.040 --> 36:57.270
He gave the fatties
big, beautiful tits

36:57.360 --> 36:59.669
and the skinnies
little, tiny niddlers.

36:59.760 --> 37:02.638
It's not my rule.
If you don't like it, call him.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.278
Hey, Mitch.

37:07.360 --> 37:08.634
Thank you.

37:08.720 --> 37:11.075
Oh, guys, look what we have here.

37:11.160 --> 37:13.833
Look. Your favourite.
Oh, you like that?

37:13.920 --> 37:17.629
- I can go with that.
- Nice? Well, it doesn't exist.

37:17.720 --> 37:21.235
Look at the hair.
It's long, flowing - like a river.

37:21.320 --> 37:23.231
Well, it's a fucking weave, OK?

37:23.320 --> 37:26.949
And the tits. Please!
I could hang my overcoat on them.

37:27.040 --> 37:29.554
Tits, by design, were invented
to be suckled by babies.

37:29.640 --> 37:33.553
Yes, they're purely functional.
These are silicone city.

37:33.640 --> 37:36.200
And look - my favourite,
the shaved pubis.

37:36.280 --> 37:39.556
Pubic hair being so unruly and all.

37:39.640 --> 37:42.712
This is a mockery, a sham.
This is bullshit.

37:44.000 --> 37:47.834
Implants, collagen, plastic,
capped teeth, the fat sucked out,

37:47.920 --> 37:50.957
the hair extended,
the nose fixed, the bush shaved...

37:51.040 --> 37:53.713
These are not real women.
They're beauty freaks.

37:53.800 --> 37:56.553
They make us normal women
with our wrinkles,

37:56.640 --> 38:00.792
our puckered boobs - hi, Bob - our
cellulite, feel somehow inadequate.

38:00.880 --> 38:02.518
Well, I don't buy it.

38:02.600 --> 38:07.310
But if you think there's a chance
you could get one of these women,

38:07.400 --> 38:11.154
you don't give us real women
any commitment - it's pathetic.

38:11.240 --> 38:15.597
What do you think you'll do? You'll
end up drooling in some nursing home,

38:15.680 --> 38:18.797
then you'll decide that it's time
to settle down, have kids?!

38:18.880 --> 38:21.633
You gonna find a cheerleader?
Charge it, Mitch.

38:21.720 --> 38:23.915
- You're oversimplifying.
- Oh, eat me!

38:24.000 --> 38:27.629
Look at Paul - models on the wall,
dog named Elle MacPherson.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.553
He's insane! He's obsessed.
You're all obsessed.

38:30.640 --> 38:34.474
If you had an ounce of self-esteem,
of self-worth, of self-confidence,

38:34.560 --> 38:39.190
you would realise that as trite as it
may sound, beauty is truly skin deep.

38:39.280 --> 38:43.239
And if you did hook a model,
I guarantee you'd be sick of her.

38:43.320 --> 38:45.515
Yeah, I suppose I'd get sick of her

38:45.600 --> 38:48.672
after about, what, 20 or 30 years?

38:50.680 --> 38:54.719
Get over yourself. Thank you, Mitch.
Say hello to Gertrude.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.997
No matter how perfect the nipple,
how supple the thigh,

38:58.080 --> 39:01.629
unless there's some other shit
going on besides the physical,

39:01.720 --> 39:03.199
it's going to get old, OK?

39:03.280 --> 39:06.113
And you guys have got to get a grip,

39:06.200 --> 39:09.954
otherwise the future
of the human race is in jeopardy.

39:13.080 --> 39:14.479
What was that?

39:14.560 --> 39:16.357
I have to wait for you, Pete?

39:16.440 --> 39:18.078
I don't know.

39:18.160 --> 39:22.711
- Great ass.
- Nice tits. Come on. Let's go.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.870
- Hey.
- What's up?

39:50.960 --> 39:52.712
Nothing.

39:56.200 --> 39:58.156
Who's the guy?

39:58.960 --> 40:04.478
- Andrew Willis. He's in my class.
- Oh. He your boyfriend?

40:05.600 --> 40:08.034
I don't know. I guess. He's OK.

40:08.800 --> 40:10.756
He seemed a little short.

40:10.840 --> 40:14.515
- He's 12 years old, Willie.
- Oh, right.

40:15.760 --> 40:18.399
So, he's not really... Right.

40:18.480 --> 40:20.152
Are you OK?

40:20.240 --> 40:22.196
Yeah. Yeah, I'm... Why?

40:22.280 --> 40:26.319
- You seem a little flavoured today.
- No! No, I'm cool.

40:26.400 --> 40:27.992
Cool.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.433
Yeah.

40:31.480 --> 40:34.153
So, tell me something.
What do you kids...?

40:34.240 --> 40:37.437
What is it you do, kids your age,
on the weekend?

40:37.520 --> 40:41.195
Well, what we've been doing lately
is smoking massive amounts of drugs,

40:41.280 --> 40:43.999
bingeing on Entenmanns
and listening to Pink Floyd.

40:44.080 --> 40:45.195
Really?

40:45.280 --> 40:47.840
You are flavoured today.

40:49.520 --> 40:52.318
- Oh, you're kidding?
- The Entenmanns part was true.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.198
Oh. Wow.

40:55.280 --> 40:59.876
So... you like this guy Andrew?

41:00.960 --> 41:05.397
He's OK. He's into male contraception
which is nice for a change.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.837
Joking.
You really got to chill, Will.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.956
Right. Right.

41:13.520 --> 41:16.273
I'm gonna go inside.

41:16.360 --> 41:19.318
- You sure you're OK?
- I'll be OK.

41:19.400 --> 41:21.072
Good.

41:23.280 --> 41:24.918
Hey, Marty!

41:25.760 --> 41:27.273
Yes?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.519
Ah, forgot what I was going to say.

41:33.880 --> 41:35.359
See you around.

41:36.320 --> 41:37.912
Bye.

41:41.280 --> 41:44.829
- I owe you five bucks, right?
- I think it's more than that.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.832
- This controller's broken.
- Shut up.

41:47.920 --> 41:50.480
- My X button doesn't work.
- You always say that.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.028
It's not fair. Hey, was that Tracy?

41:53.120 --> 41:54.553
Yep.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.596
- Is she hot?
- She's nice.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.717
Ascribe a numerical value -
face, body, personality.

41:59.800 --> 42:01.756
I'm not gonna do that.

42:01.840 --> 42:04.513
- Come on. Do it.
- Don't be vile.

42:04.600 --> 42:07.751
- Grow up. Do it.
- You don't have to.

42:07.840 --> 42:09.831
I don't know, let's see. Face...

42:09.920 --> 42:13.993
- We need a frame of reference.
- I thought I was vile.

42:14.080 --> 42:16.116
- You gotta do it proper.
- Who?

42:16.200 --> 42:17.838
Kelly Norman.

42:17.920 --> 42:22.152
All right. Let's see.
Kelly Norman - face, six;

42:22.240 --> 42:24.913
body, eight and a half;

42:25.000 --> 42:26.831
personality, four.

42:26.920 --> 42:29.753
Yes, sir.

42:29.840 --> 42:32.400
- Jennifer Colton.
- Jennifer Colton?

42:34.000 --> 42:35.672
Face, one;

42:36.320 --> 42:39.153
body, two; personality, three.

42:39.240 --> 42:42.949
- OK, I got it, so...
- Wait!

42:43.040 --> 42:45.395
Carmen Swisher.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.474
- Who?
- Carmen Swisher, man. Porn star.

42:48.560 --> 42:50.949
- I don't know her.
- Yeah, you do.

42:51.040 --> 42:52.632
She's in Fistful Of Vixens.

42:52.720 --> 42:57.316
The one who gets all of her orifices
penetrated by those circus midgets?

42:57.400 --> 43:00.870
Oh shit, that's her?
That's her name? She's good.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.916
- Very talented girl.
- Very talented.

43:03.000 --> 43:04.592
Face, seven;

43:04.680 --> 43:07.114
body, nine and a half...

43:08.480 --> 43:11.278
and personality -
well, the sky's the limit.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.868
Those midgets
got a real kick out of her.

43:14.960 --> 43:16.154
Exactly.

43:16.240 --> 43:18.549
So do Tracy now.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.278
Tracy.

43:23.840 --> 43:27.594
Face - good, solid...
seven and a half.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.877
Body - good, solid...
seven and a half.

43:33.960 --> 43:37.555
Personality - good, solid...

43:39.040 --> 43:40.758
seven and a half.

43:40.840 --> 43:44.116
- Sounds excellent, man.
- When's she coming in?

43:44.200 --> 43:49.194
He has the puck! He shoots,
he scores. Yes! Two nothing.

43:50.960 --> 43:55.078
Tommy, would you mind pulling over?
I have to go to the bathroom.

43:55.160 --> 43:58.550
What? We're gonna be
at the restaurant in five minutes.

43:58.640 --> 44:02.235
No, it's gonna take longer than that.
We could just pull in here.

44:02.320 --> 44:05.312
The VFW? We'll be at the restaurant
in five minutes.

44:05.400 --> 44:08.710
I'm not feeling good.
I just need to go in quick.

44:08.800 --> 44:11.837
Did you eat today?
Did you eat anything?

44:11.920 --> 44:14.036
- I ate.
- What did you eat?

44:14.120 --> 44:18.113
- What did you eat?
- It doesn't matter what I ate.

44:18.200 --> 44:22.398
You never eat, then get stomach pains
and wonder why.

44:22.480 --> 44:25.472
- Cos you didn't eat.
- I did so.

44:25.560 --> 44:27.949
You can't do this.
It's eight o'clock...

44:28.040 --> 44:30.429
- Stop it.
- All right. Forget it.

44:30.520 --> 44:34.069
- Good.
- I'm concerned, that's all.

44:35.240 --> 44:36.275
Surprise!

44:46.520 --> 44:48.875
That's nice.

44:51.640 --> 44:53.949
Happy Birthday, Birdy.

44:54.040 --> 44:58.238
- Did you know?
- I had no idea.

44:58.320 --> 45:00.629
Let's get the party started.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.597
- I'm DJing.
- No.

45:02.680 --> 45:04.989
Paul, no. No Jethro Tull.

45:10.880 --> 45:12.518
Hey, you're looking great.

45:20.120 --> 45:22.998
- He didn't know.
- It was beautiful.

45:32.360 --> 45:34.510
- Second course.
- That's right.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.637
- Yo, what's up, guys?
- What's up, man?

45:40.960 --> 45:43.713
Spider, let me explain.
This is my domain.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.791
Let me explain something, my friend.

45:45.880 --> 45:48.189
This is my domain. I don't want...

45:54.120 --> 45:56.759
It ought to be Stinky's - big sign...

45:56.840 --> 45:58.876
Our motto - "Go ugly early".

46:02.640 --> 46:06.030
I like that. Stinky's.
It would look good on the matches.

46:06.120 --> 46:12.434
You know what I was thinking?
We planned all this in the salon...

46:12.520 --> 46:15.159
Congratulations to all of us.

46:15.240 --> 46:17.515
You're happy, I'm happy, Sharon.

46:35.400 --> 46:36.753
Hey, Darian.

46:38.440 --> 46:42.513
- What the fuck is she doing?
- Your boy's fucked now, buddy.

46:42.600 --> 46:46.434
- Holy shit!
- Oh, Christ!

46:46.520 --> 46:50.399
Food for the hungry,
drink for the thirsty...

46:52.800 --> 46:56.031
- Shit.
- The odds just increased.

46:56.120 --> 46:57.678
Fuck, man. Who told her?

46:57.760 --> 47:02.436
It's all right. I'm sure
she's just gonna walk right back out.

47:02.520 --> 47:04.192
Darian.

47:05.280 --> 47:07.794
- Hey.
- Happy birthday.

47:07.880 --> 47:11.759
- That's really nice. Thanks.
- I got this for your birthday.

47:11.840 --> 47:16.834
- I mean this is for you and for me.
- Thanks, guys.

47:18.240 --> 47:21.277
- It's too much.
- Somebody should go over.

47:21.360 --> 47:23.316
You smell good.

47:24.200 --> 47:26.919
- Let's get outta here.
- You wanna go?

47:27.000 --> 47:29.878
- We're going!
- Fine. I'm ready to go.

47:29.960 --> 47:33.396
She polluted the air,
as far as I'm concerned.

47:33.480 --> 47:38.429
- Don't even think twice about it.
- Get home early. Pay the sitter.

47:39.160 --> 47:41.594
- Do you like it?
- I don't know.

47:41.680 --> 47:43.989
- I put the bow on.
- It's really nice.

47:44.080 --> 47:47.595
- Should we do something?
- What?

47:47.680 --> 47:49.636
What the fuck is that?

47:50.840 --> 47:55.789
- I don't understand.
- I have no idea why she's here.

47:55.880 --> 47:58.678
But it's classic Birdman.

47:58.760 --> 48:01.320
It's not funny, but it is true.

48:19.520 --> 48:23.479
- Steven's in New York.
- That's great. Great.

48:24.560 --> 48:26.915
Kristen's with my folks.

48:27.000 --> 48:28.353
Uh-huh.

48:34.600 --> 48:37.512
It was your special night, Tommy.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.468
Why couldn't I share
in your special night?

48:41.560 --> 48:43.596
Because...

48:43.680 --> 48:44.908
Good night, Darian.

48:47.240 --> 48:49.470
I want you to come inside.

48:49.560 --> 48:52.074
I'm not goin' inside.

48:52.160 --> 48:58.076
Come on, Tommy.
I have to give you your real present.

48:58.160 --> 49:01.550
What you gave me is fine, OK?
Darian, come on.

49:02.720 --> 49:04.995
Come on.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.753
You can slip into
something more comfortable.

49:07.840 --> 49:09.512
Like what?

49:09.600 --> 49:11.272
Like me.

49:23.240 --> 49:26.437
- Come on, Darian. I gotta go.
- Come on, Tommy. Grow up.

49:26.520 --> 49:29.432
I gotta go. Just go inside, will you?

49:30.840 --> 49:32.831
Just get out.

49:41.520 --> 49:43.715
We always gotta do this, don't we?

49:43.800 --> 49:46.109
Just go inside.

49:47.800 --> 49:49.791
OK. Fuck it.

49:53.640 --> 49:55.198
Stupid truck.

50:05.000 --> 50:08.072
All I'm saying is
you have this amazing thing,

50:08.160 --> 50:12.119
you got his person with all
that potential, all that future...

50:12.200 --> 50:15.909
This girl... is gonna be amazing.

50:16.000 --> 50:19.834
She's smart,
she's funny... she's hot...

50:19.920 --> 50:22.354
- She's 13!
- I know. Get over it.

50:22.440 --> 50:25.432
It's not a sexual thing. This is...

50:25.520 --> 50:27.476
- I could wait.
- What?

50:27.560 --> 50:32.076
In ten years, she'll be 23,
I'll be 39, it won't be a big deal.

50:32.160 --> 50:34.720
Willie... you're scaring me here.

50:34.800 --> 50:36.950
This girl is gonna be amazing.

50:39.120 --> 50:40.553
Great.

50:43.880 --> 50:48.396
I was actually jealous
of this little kid on a bike,

50:48.480 --> 50:53.110
this short little kid on a bike,
cos he gets to be her age now.

50:53.200 --> 50:57.113
I get to be some vile old man,
like... What's his name?

50:57.200 --> 51:00.909
- Roman Polanski.
- No, like... Nabokov.

51:01.000 --> 51:03.912
Like some Nabokov character.

51:04.000 --> 51:09.154
Like some old fat, hairy, fat,
stinky, putrid man.

51:09.240 --> 51:12.198
And...

51:12.280 --> 51:16.671
I don't know. You just want to say
to her in all sincerity,

51:16.760 --> 51:19.513
"Take me with you when you go."

51:20.600 --> 51:26.789
Willie, the girl was a zygote
when you were in the seventh grade.

51:29.240 --> 51:32.437
So what? What are you saying?

51:32.520 --> 51:36.195
That this is my way
of postponing the inevitable?

51:36.280 --> 51:39.033
My way of saying
I don't wanna grow old?

51:39.120 --> 51:43.750
No, I think it's your way
of saying you don't want to grow up.

51:52.240 --> 51:57.030
I just want something beautiful.

52:00.400 --> 52:03.073
We all want something beautiful.

52:33.360 --> 52:37.956
Hi, Mrs Cassidy. I know it's late.
I'm sorry. Is Sharon home?

52:38.040 --> 52:41.396
- She's sleeping, Tom.
- Can I see her?

52:41.480 --> 52:44.233
- She's sleeping.
- OK.

52:45.080 --> 52:49.119
I'm sorry. Could you just tell her
that I stopped by?

52:50.640 --> 52:55.794
You should know Sharon put a lot
of planning into tonight, Tom.

52:58.920 --> 53:01.559
Mom, it's all right. Go to bed.

53:02.080 --> 53:03.513
Hey.

53:03.600 --> 53:06.160
I just... I want to apologise.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.869
You don't have to. I'm fine.

53:09.960 --> 53:11.837
I feel that I should explain.

53:11.920 --> 53:15.754
You know what, Tommy?
It's a little late.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.710
Yeah. OK.

53:29.160 --> 53:30.832
All right.

54:38.240 --> 54:40.276
Willie C. What's up?

54:40.360 --> 54:42.351
- Hey, fellas.
- What's goin' on?

54:43.280 --> 54:45.236
You never went home last night?

54:45.320 --> 54:48.392
Came here. Pike is runnin'.
Haven't caught a thing.

54:48.480 --> 54:51.313
- Guess what I did this morning.
- What?

54:51.400 --> 54:55.393
Made a phone call to Stinky's cousin,
the lovely Andera.

54:55.480 --> 54:59.837
- What happened?
- She's going out with me. Thank you.

54:59.920 --> 55:01.717
Like on a date?

55:02.440 --> 55:06.035
We didn't get into specifics.
Jealous?

55:06.720 --> 55:09.598
- Well...
- A little bit.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.153
Come on, Elle. Let's get some air.

55:20.560 --> 55:22.312
Jesus!

55:23.760 --> 55:25.512
Is that Mo?

55:26.000 --> 55:28.070
Fuckin' Mo has got it wired, man.

55:28.160 --> 55:31.038
He's like a retard
that doesn't know any better.

55:31.120 --> 55:34.669
He doesn't desire new experiences,
new women, nothing. Look at him.

55:34.760 --> 55:38.799
He's like the mental patient
that doesn't know he's mental.

55:38.880 --> 55:41.394
So he's perfectly content.

55:41.480 --> 55:45.359
- I gotta go take a piss.
- I'll see you later.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.629
Hey!

55:58.160 --> 56:00.435
I'll see you later.

56:06.600 --> 56:08.670
What the heck are you doing here?

56:08.760 --> 56:12.435
My friends are ice fishing
in the shack over there.

56:12.520 --> 56:14.272
Those guys are your friends?

56:14.360 --> 56:17.033
- You know 'em?
- They're here every Sunday.

56:17.120 --> 56:21.432
We call them the Drunken Dry-heavin'
Cheese-eatin' Outhouse Boys.

56:21.520 --> 56:23.636
They're your friends?

56:23.720 --> 56:27.269
- They're acquaintances, really.
- Right.

56:28.440 --> 56:30.351
- So, where's Scooter?
- Who?

56:30.440 --> 56:34.194
What's his name? Billy? Tiger?
Pookie? The kid on the bike?

56:34.280 --> 56:37.158
- Andrew?
- Andrew, that's it. Where is he?

56:37.240 --> 56:40.835
He dorked out on me.
I'm not into him any more.

56:40.920 --> 56:43.354
Ah. So you got someone new?

56:48.520 --> 56:50.397
Yep. You!

56:51.200 --> 56:52.155
What?

56:52.960 --> 56:55.758
You. You're my new boyfriend.
You up to it?

56:55.840 --> 56:57.398
Oh, I feel faint!

57:00.880 --> 57:02.757
My hero.

57:05.440 --> 57:08.193
So you gonna marry that girl in NYC?

57:08.280 --> 57:10.236
I don't know. Why?

57:11.320 --> 57:14.198
- I don't think you should.
- How come?

57:14.280 --> 57:18.034
You should wait until
you meet someone who excites you.

57:18.120 --> 57:20.475
Well, she may not be out there.

57:20.560 --> 57:24.030
It's like the Wizard of Oz.
It was in your own backyard.

57:24.120 --> 57:26.714
What do you mean?

57:26.800 --> 57:29.155
You. Me and you.

57:33.000 --> 57:35.753
- Really?
- Yep. You don't think?

57:35.840 --> 57:38.957
Well, we have a little age problem.

57:39.040 --> 57:41.838
I know. We're as star-crossed
as Romeo and Juliet.

57:41.920 --> 57:44.388
It's a tragedy
of Elizabethan proportions.

57:44.480 --> 57:46.789
"What light
through yonder window breaks?

57:46.880 --> 57:48.916
"Tis the east
and Juliet is the sun."

57:54.880 --> 57:56.313
- Weird.
- No way.

57:57.320 --> 57:59.834
So, um... So what do we do?

57:59.920 --> 58:03.879
Alas, poor Romeo, we can't do diddly.
You'll go to penitentiary,

58:03.960 --> 58:06.918
I'll be the laughing stock
of the Brownies.

58:07.000 --> 58:10.834
But if your feelings for me are true,
you'll wait.

58:11.760 --> 58:12.795
Wait?

58:14.200 --> 58:16.998
Yep. Wait 5 years.

58:17.080 --> 58:20.470
I'll be 18 and we can walk
through this world together.

58:24.400 --> 58:29.315
- In 5 years you won't remember me.
- William.

58:29.400 --> 58:32.870
I'm formed and you're not.
You have changes to go through.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.791
You'll change.

58:34.880 --> 58:37.269
And I'll be Winnie The Pooh
to your Christopher Robin.

58:37.360 --> 58:41.239
No literary reference left unturned.
How do you figure Pooh?

58:41.320 --> 58:44.073
Christopher Robin outgrew Pooh.
That's how it ended.

58:44.160 --> 58:47.755
He had Pooh when he was a child.
When he matured,

58:47.840 --> 58:51.276
he didn't need him any more.

58:51.360 --> 58:54.033
That's the saddest thing
I ever heard.

58:54.120 --> 58:56.554
Yeah, but it's true.

58:56.640 --> 59:00.918
You don't realise it now,
but you'll be doing some changing.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.190
And...

59:08.400 --> 59:10.152
I can't be a Pooh.

59:14.480 --> 59:18.519
- I think I'll skate away now, Pooh.
- All right, Christopher.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.951
- Hey, Earl.
- Hey, good one!

01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.716
Sit down here. It's a better view.

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:35.152
So, where are your buddies?

01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:40.036
- Huh?
- Your buddies?

01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:42.076
Oh, they're gonna be late.

01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:45.152
Hi. A bottle
of your best champagne, please.

01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.357
We don't have a best champagne.
They're all the same.

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.318
Thank you. That'll be fine.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.118
You really look nice.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.397
- What is going on?
- What do you mean?

01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:05.835
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:09.879
- What's with this Al Capone shit?
- What Al Capone shit?

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:11.632
Who's the girl?

01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.473
- What girl?
- That girl right over there.

01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.514
She's... She's my book-keeper.

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:20.158
- Your book-keeper?
- Yes.

01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:24.472
- You are full of shit.
- She's very efficient, that girl.

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:29.509
Paul, I'm gonna get up and make
the biggest scene you can imagine.

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:33.479
She's my cousin. We fell out
and we don't speak in public.

01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:37.075
- Bye, Paul. I'm leaving.
- All right, all right.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.958
She's my ex-girlfriend.
We broke up after seven years

01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.316
because she's seeing
that meat cutter over there.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:47.234
It drives me crazy, OK? And...

01:01:47.320 --> 01:01:50.312
I was just showing off.

01:01:51.480 --> 01:01:53.391
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:57.475
Just please don't make a scene.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.358
Oh, we'll make a scene.
You don't need this.

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.351
Who is that?

01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:54.113
- It's Paul.
- No shit.

01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:58.676
- Who's the babe?
- I don't know.

01:02:58.760 --> 01:03:00.716
She's gorgeous.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.948
Well, not gorgeous like you.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:06.793
- Gorgeous just the same.
- Can we leave?

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.233
Sure.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.509
Fuck!

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:37.990
- Andera, where you goin'?
- Home.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.072
- Why?
- That was for you.

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.596
I was trying to help you out.
You're such a knucklehead.

01:03:44.680 --> 01:03:47.752
- Come back inside.
- Bye, Paul.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:50.195
- Andera...
- Bye, Paul.

01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.033
- Come on.
- Bye, Paul.

01:03:53.120 --> 01:03:55.076
I'll call you tomorrow, all right?

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:59.112
- She likes fresh air, you know?
- Sure.

01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:57.869
Hey, what you doin' out so late?

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:02.197
I was out with your friend Paul.

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.955
He's not my friend,
he lives in my house.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:10.476
I got roaches,
I got termites and I got Paul.

01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:12.949
- You need a lift?
- No.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.952
It's nice to be able
to walk after dark.

01:05:16.040 --> 01:05:19.476
Yeah, it's one of the few perks
of living here.

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.312
It's a good one.

01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:27.390
Can I ask a question? How long have
you been with your boyfriend?

01:05:27.480 --> 01:05:30.597
- Eight months.
- And it's good?

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.272
It's very good.

01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.873
He makes you happy?

01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.234
Yeah.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.353
I look for that in a man. The ones
who make me miserable never last.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:45.714
Right.

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:50.715
There's four words I need to hear
before I go to sleep. Four words.

01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.475
Good night, sweet girl.
That's all it takes.

01:05:56.040 --> 01:05:58.315
I'm easy, I know.

01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:02.791
But a guy who can muster up those
words is a guy I'll stay with.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.792
Right. You sure
you don't need a ride?

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:11.399
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:14.074
- See you around.
- I'll see you.

01:06:18.720 --> 01:06:21.109
Good night, sweet girl.

01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.199
I spoke to Jan this morning
and it's obvious she no longer cares.

01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:43.159
She ran out of that restaurant
like a maniac, but I guess later,

01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:45.754
she realised she didn't give a shit.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.070
Yeah?

01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:51.152
I spoke to Tracy.
She's coming up for the reunion.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.754
Is that right?
I gotta meet this Tracy.

01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:59.915
- You got to take this shit down.
- Why?

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.073
- You're like a serial killer.
- Don't cap on my supermodels.

01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.355
- Leave it alone.
- It's creepy.

01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:08.556
Look who's talking,
Mr Jerry Lee Lewis.

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:10.710
Oh, fucking Mo!

01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.554
I don't judge. If she can cut
her own food, she's fair game.

01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:20.590
OK. All I'm saying is you got to take
all this down because it's creepy...

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:25.708
Look. The supermodel's a beautiful
girl, Will. She can make you dizzy,

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:27.916
like you've been drinking
Jack all morning.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.993
She can make you feel high for
the greatest commodity known to man -

01:07:32.080 --> 01:07:34.389
promise, the promise of a better day,

01:07:34.480 --> 01:07:36.277
the promise of a greater hope,

01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:38.157
the promise of a new tomorrow.

01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:43.075
This particular ore can be found
in the gait of a beautiful girl -

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:46.197
in her smile, in her soul,

01:07:46.280 --> 01:07:49.829
in the way she makes every rotten
thing about life seem OK.

01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.799
The supermodels, Willie? That's all
they are - bottled promise.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:58.917
Scenes from a new day,
hope in stiletto heels.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:07.316
I am now going to
check your freezer for human heads.

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:11.714
A beautiful girl's all-powerful
and that is as good as love.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.313
That's as good as love.

01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:15.674
It's...

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:22.108
just that I gotta think
beyond a couple times a week.

01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:25.272
I feel like
the biggest scumbag on earth

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:27.794
every time
I see your kid smiling at me.

01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:29.711
Look, Mommy.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:32.118
That's nice, honey.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:35.515
It's ridiculous.

01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:38.796
It's making me nuts.
It's making you nuts.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:40.756
Sharon, Steven...

01:08:41.800 --> 01:08:45.314
I have worked it
so that he has no idea.

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:48.517
That's cos I don't show up
at your parties drunk.

01:08:48.600 --> 01:08:53.116
- Sharon knew way before then.
- Maybe Steve doesn't give a shit.

01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:58.069
Tommy, don't try to characterise
my marriage as a bad one.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:02.471
- I love Steven.
- So why are you fucking me?

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.312
I don't know.

01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:09.554
But I guess I won't be any more.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.156
No. I guess not.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.876
I wonder how I'll survive.

01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.518
Oh, please!

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:29.639
I told Steven
the reunion would be a total bore.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:34.157
And I assume Sharon
won't be accompanying you, right?

01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:37.470
No, you've taken care of that.

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.312
- Mom.
- What?

01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:00.239
OK, sweetie. Come on.
We'll go home, OK?

01:10:00.320 --> 01:10:02.595
All right, put the other arm in.

01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:04.636
OK. Very good.

01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:12.234
Look. It'll be great.
We'll be there alone.

01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:14.834
It'll be just like the old days.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:23.198
And we'll see if you really
just broke up with me or not.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:24.998
Let's go, honey.

01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.513
Hey.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.876
How you doin'?
Want some wine to warm you up?

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.359
Sure.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.479
Thanks, Stan.

01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:28.036
That was nice. Really nice.

01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:32.676
Less intense and emotionally
possessed than normal,

01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:36.753
but no less effective because
of its pointless colouration.

01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:38.398
Excuse me?

01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:42.758
My teacher's exact comment after
my first recital - Rhapsody In Blue.

01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.910
When in doubt, go Gershwin.

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:47.238
You drunk?

01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.148
I don't know
but you both look beautiful.

01:11:53.240 --> 01:11:54.798
So why the sad face?

01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:00.472
Job requirement.
Happy piano players work the circus.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.870
I think you Knight's Ridge boys
take the ladies way too seriously.

01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:05.996
Only until baseball season starts.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.358
Pitchers and catchers report in
two months, three weeks and six days.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.439
- Wanna go home with me?
- No.

01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:20.469
OK, I had to ask. To be honest,
I don't find you at all attractive.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.152
- Really?
- Really.

01:12:22.240 --> 01:12:25.869
- So now you wanna go home with me?
- No.

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:29.350
- Well, I tried every angle.
- Job requirement.

01:12:29.440 --> 01:12:31.351
Exactly.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:34.392
Play something else.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.597
You don't like this boozy,
after-hours musician banter?

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.989
Can't dance to it.

01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:42.910
You'd be surprised.

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:49.389
OK, you've spurned
both my sexual advances,

01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:54.110
my attempts at conversation, so I'm
gonna reach into my bag of tricks...

01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:59.876
- Wanna go ice fishing?
- I'd love to.

01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.389
Great.

01:13:05.160 --> 01:13:09.631
You know how it is at the beginnings
when you first fall in love?

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:12.075
You can't eat. You can't sleep.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:17.393
Getting a call from her makes your
day, like seeing a shooting star.

01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:22.235
- It's the best.
- But inevitably, it goes away.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.834
So, this is my thing, you see.

01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:29.357
Why get married now? Why not have
two, three more of those beginnings

01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:32.398
before I settle into the big fade?

01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:36.189
The big fade?
That's an awful way to put it.

01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.796
- She's coming tomorrow.
- That's obvious.

01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:46.635
I got no feeling about that. I got a
feeling of overwhelming ambivalence.

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.918
But I would rather dread her arrival
than not give a shit.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.474
It's amazing that there's a guy
that gets to do things with you.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:01.791
He gets to make you happy,
spend evenings with you...

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.269
Make me martinis,
listen to Van Morrison...

01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:07.636
- Smell your skin...
...after a day at the beach.

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:11.030
- And read the papers...
...on a Sunday morning.

01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:15.318
A rainy Sunday morning. And pepper
your belly with baby kisses.

01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:19.638
Sorry...

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:25.832
There's a guy out there that
thinks the same thing about Tracy.

01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:31.037
He's jealous of you,
you getting to do all that with her.

01:14:34.320 --> 01:14:38.472
Can you think of anything better than
making love to an attractive stranger

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:42.473
on a frozen lake with
just an oil light to guide your way?

01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:45.515
Can you think of anything better?

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.670
Going back to Chicago.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:52.151
Ice-cold martini. Van Morrison.

01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.397
Sunday papers. Got you.

01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.873
I gotta go.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:05.633
Hey.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:09.148
Why do I feel
like I'll never see you again?

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:12.276
You'll see me again, Willie.

01:15:20.920 --> 01:15:22.273
Damn.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.312
Hi.

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.359
You look awful.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.750
- I've been drunk for two weeks.
- Nice.

01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:20.111
- How was it, the drive?
- The roads were awful. Sheet ice.

01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:22.191
You got here safe.
I'll make you some tea.

01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:32.153
That was delicious.
Really superb, Tracy.

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.629
- Thank you.
- The fact that you can cook,

01:16:34.720 --> 01:16:37.553
rolled into the fact
that you're a successful lawyer

01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:41.792
and the fact that you are stunning
to look at, just makes me insane.

01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:45.553
Bobby!

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.392
I'm flattered, Bobby.

01:16:49.880 --> 01:16:51.836
It really was superb, Tracy.

01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:56.757
- All right, we're gonna shower...
- Why?

01:16:56.840 --> 01:17:00.037
We're going over to Mo's
for a pre-bash thing. Why?

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:02.588
You want to shower first or should I?

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:06.036
Why don't you shower first, Will?

01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:09.829
We can take the rest
of the time to bond.

01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:13.196
- Go ahead. I'll be fine.
- Superb.

01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:16.438
It really was superb, Tracy.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.629
Hey!

01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:43.513
Romeo And Juliet,
the dyslexic version.

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:48.675
- What are you doing?
- Another exciting Saturday night.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.911
You got many exciting Saturday nights
in your future.

01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.355
Yeah. Yeah.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:00.396
- So your lady's here, huh?
- Yeah.

01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:06.472
I saw her. She's really pretty.

01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:11.199
She's OK. She's not as pretty
as you, though.

01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.594
Got that boob thing
going for her, though.

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:17.752
And she can get into R-rated movies.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:23.675
Two words not in her vocabulary -
"lunch money".

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:34.031
Hey, Marty.

01:18:39.520 --> 01:18:41.988
I hope we stay in touch.

01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:48.155
Cos I hope to learn
someday about what you're doing.

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:52.438
Cos I think whatever it is,
it'll be amazing.

01:18:54.720 --> 01:18:56.278
I really do.

01:18:58.280 --> 01:18:59.633
Thank you.

01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:01.358
You got it.

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.952
- It was great.
- I'm glad you enjoyed it.

01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:22.158
- Thank you for coming.
- Trace, we gotta get going.

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:24.999
Bye.

01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:31.632
- Take care, now. Be careful!
- Stay warm, guys.

01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:34.639
Bye.

01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:44.789
It's unbelievable. They haven't liked
anyone since Steve McQueen died.

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.031
- You just...
- They're nice.

01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.954
Nice. They're as far away
from nice as...

01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:55.032
If nice is London, they are Tokyo.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.792
OK.

01:19:58.880 --> 01:20:00.836
You're nice.

01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:13.952
I can't believe you're not gonna go.

01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:16.395
I'm laying low. You have fun.

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.109
You loved high school. Everybody's
gonna wonder what happened.

01:20:20.200 --> 01:20:22.873
So tell them I'm in Geneva,

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:26.589
doing my presentation
on sub-zero water removal.

01:20:26.680 --> 01:20:29.114
You just wanna sit here like a loser.

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:32.988
Channel 38's showing
Rich Man, Poor Man - all 12 parts.

01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:40.155
- No shit?
- Back to back.

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:43.676
Holy shit. Fuck!

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.068
Fuck!

01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:50.995
364 nights a year I do dick.
The one night I decide to go out...

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.275
You gotta tape it for me.

01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.715
- Can't do it.
- Why not?

01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:58.155
You can't tape Rich Man, Poor Man.

01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:02.074
You gotta watch it with the
commercials just like everybody else.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.118
That's a good point.

01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:07.350
Falcon Eddie.

01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:11.831
Man, was there ever a more terrifying
screen villain than Falcon Eddie?

01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.069
No.

01:21:15.840 --> 01:21:18.115
- You're gonna watch it?
- Yep.

01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.475
- All 12 parts?
- Back to back.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.879
Shit.

01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:29.748
It's a tough call. You're a bastard.

01:21:29.840 --> 01:21:31.034
Yep.

01:21:34.440 --> 01:21:35.793
Oh, shit...

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.796
Don't drink too much punch.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.076
Stanley, you kill me.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:01.472
- How does that work?
- That's not what I practise...

01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.074
- You want some more?
- Yeah.

01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.391
Tracy. Hey, Paul. You good?

01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:10.392
So, listen... I like this.

01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:12.311
She makes those herself.

01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:14.675
Mohammed, one white wine, please.

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.639
- Willie, she is delightful.
- Delightful? Are you Rex Harrison?

01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:21.393
She's amazing.
What is your malfunction?

01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:26.031
She's smart, she's funny,
she's got a great ass, nice rack...

01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:29.237
- Nice rack.
- She's charming, rich, great ass...

01:22:29.320 --> 01:22:32.232
- You mentioned that.
- It's that good, Will.

01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.595
- Hey, Frank?
- Hey, Tommy.

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:41.478
- Get a Bud?
- Sure.

01:22:58.400 --> 01:23:02.632
- You're beautiful.
- Always room for improvement.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.030
Do you know who you look like?
Ally Sheedy.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:09.396
Do you know Ally Sheedy?
Whatever happened to her?

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:12.677
She was in The Breakfast Club
with the Estevez brothers.

01:23:12.760 --> 01:23:15.593
- That's right.
- I've never seen her since.

01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:18.797
- Did you ever see Misery?
- No.

01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:24.000
- Cos you remind me of Kathy Bates.
- Oh, don't you say that!

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.789
Did you hear Andera
went back to Chicago?

01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:31.270
She was supposed to stay
for the reunion, but she just left.

01:23:31.360 --> 01:23:33.078
Really?

01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.993
What did you do to her in that shack?

01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:39.913
I told you, we just talked.

01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:43.834
- You told her things, didn't you?
- What things?

01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:48.072
- You let her behind the curtain.
- Maybe she missed her boyfriend.

01:23:48.160 --> 01:23:50.879
You let her
behind the curtain. I know.

01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:52.598
Never let 'em behind, Will.

01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:57.356
You never let them see the old man
working the levers of the great Oz.

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.671
They're all sisters, Willie.
They aren't allowed back there.

01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:02.352
They mustn't see.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:10.069
Tell me the truth. You stay up nights
thinking about this shit?

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:12.674
You say it like it's a bad thing.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.516
Hi, Darian. Good to see you.

01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:36.919
Susan.

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.153
...and your last name?
- Smalls.

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.957
Say, didn't you used to be
Darian Smalls?

01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:53.352
- That's right.
- I'm Peter Gropeman. Remember me?

01:24:53.440 --> 01:24:54.759
No.

01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:59.599
I used to have a weight problem.
You called me Peter the Eater.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:03.719
- You made me cry in seventh grade.
- I did?

01:25:03.800 --> 01:25:05.552
I'm sorry.

01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:07.835
You here alone?

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:15.435
- Yeah, I guess I am.
- That's weird. Darian Smalls alone.

01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.715
God you were something
in those days.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.756
You were beautiful.

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.116
But if you don't mind me saying,
mean as a snake.

01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.716
You were as mean as a snake.

01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:47.680
Hello, Tom.

01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.273
Steve.

01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.318
How come you're not at the reunion?

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:56.154
- Wasn't into it.
- Won't Darian be disappointed?

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.556
- Did she go?
- Yeah.

01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:03.757
- That's nice.
- Can I buy you a drink?

01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:08.549
- No, I got one.
- Come on, Tom. One drink.

01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:11.393
I was just gonna be leaving.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.232
OK.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:17.032
Let me see if I got this straight.

01:26:17.120 --> 01:26:21.910
I can't buy you a drink, but you can
stick your dick into my wife.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.472
- Frank, shot of rye.
- Two.

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:33.234
See, I think it's Knight's Ridge.

01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.073
Fucking working-class towns, man.

01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:38.879
Girls here see a tool belt,
they get moist.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:42.316
I got an extra one
I can lend you, Steve.

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.949
Hook you up
with some vice grips, ratchet...

01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:48.952
Don't fuck with me, man.

01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.594
Don't worry about them, either.
This is me and you.

01:26:54.680 --> 01:26:57.797
You know, I don't think it is, Steve.

01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:02.556
You don't strike me as the type
who fights his own battles,

01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:05.473
but I give you
the benefit of the doubt.

01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:12.832
I tell you what. Drink your shot,
go back to your boys,

01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.994
play quarters, whatever you frat boys
do and I'll get out of your hair.

01:27:18.080 --> 01:27:20.071
Thanks, Frank.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:45.311
- You couldn't leave it alone.
- That's right, mother...

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:16.791
Fuck. You.

01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:28.158
- Let's go.
- Fuckin' lowlife.

01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:30.037
Fuckin' showed him.

01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.029
Shit!

01:28:41.120 --> 01:28:42.997
- Michael!
- What?

01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:47.551
Frank just called.
Tommy got the shit kicked out of him.

01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:49.392
- By who?
- Let's go.

01:28:49.480 --> 01:28:54.190
- I don't think you should.
- Sarah, not now, OK? Come on.

01:28:54.280 --> 01:28:56.874
I'm goin'. Come on.

01:28:59.080 --> 01:29:02.152
- Will? Willie?
- Go.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.636
- Where is he?
- He didn't want me to call the cops.

01:29:21.720 --> 01:29:23.517
Thanks.

01:29:24.600 --> 01:29:27.478
- Who the fuck did this?
- Calm down, Mo.

01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:29.869
Frank, who did this?

01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.349
Rossmore. He and his buddies.

01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:34.749
- Where are you goin'?
- To find Rossmore.

01:29:34.840 --> 01:29:39.595
- Suddenly, he's Charles Bronson.
- Get him to a hospital. Come on.

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.552
It's snowing. I can't believe
I'm gonna have to plough tonight.

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:56.916
Tommy was sleeping with his wife.

01:29:58.440 --> 01:29:59.873
So?

01:30:01.440 --> 01:30:03.715
It's not like he was that innocent.

01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:06.758
So he deserved that?
You see his face?

01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.673
Look, this does present
a moral dilemma.

01:30:15.000 --> 01:30:18.072
All right, fuck him.
Let's lynch the bastard.

01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:40.476
You got a plan?

01:30:44.160 --> 01:30:45.479
No plan.

01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:48.552
- Think he's here?
- I don't know.

01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:52.033
- Fucking douchebag, man.
- Easy, Mo.

01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:54.076
Take it easy.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:58.149
You fuck with my friend,
you fuck with me!

01:30:58.240 --> 01:31:02.791
Beat up my friend, you beat up me!
You fuck with me, you fuck with you!

01:31:02.880 --> 01:31:05.678
You get mad when you drink,
you don't drink!

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.912
- What are you talking about?
- Don't talk back.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.636
- What?
- We got company.

01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:18.791
The cavalry has arrived. Assholes.

01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:33.916
Car trouble, fellas?

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.516
I didn't even see you!

01:31:43.160 --> 01:31:46.311
Now, where were we, shithead?

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:53.436
Daddy, what's going on?

01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.474
I'm just trying to save
my family here, man, all right?

01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:14.475
- Just stay away from us, Stevie.
- Come on.

01:32:16.760 --> 01:32:19.957
Hey, darlin', just go back inside.
I'll be right in.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:21.678
OK.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.118
- All right?
- Yeah, let's get outta here.

01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:40.958
Fuckin' kids comin' out and shit...

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.600
- What did you say?
- Just babbling.

01:32:43.680 --> 01:32:45.238
See you, fellas.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.509
- How is he?
- I don't know.

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:24.149
- What did they say?
- They didn't say nothin'.

01:33:25.040 --> 01:33:28.112
- How are you?
- You guys do your macho things?

01:33:28.200 --> 01:33:32.079
We just went over
and Mo pushed him around a bit.

01:33:35.960 --> 01:33:42.149
- Did you tell Annie we'd be late?
- Yeah. I told her to sleep over.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:46.756
- That was good.
- You OK?

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.558
Yeah.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.200
- I'm sorry.
- Just don't...

01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:53.236
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:56.632
I love you, baby.

01:33:56.720 --> 01:33:59.518
Miss, would you check
on room 309, please?

01:33:59.600 --> 01:34:02.398
- You haven't heard anything?
- Here we go.

01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:05.708
- Who called her?
- I don't know.

01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:07.950
Who do you think? Me.

01:34:08.040 --> 01:34:11.476
- What's up?
- He's gonna be OK.

01:34:11.560 --> 01:34:15.872
He has a concussion, two broken ribs
and took about 30 stitches.

01:34:15.960 --> 01:34:19.396
- But he's gonna be OK?
- Yeah. He's gonna be fine.

01:34:19.480 --> 01:34:22.040
He said it's snowing
and that somebody should...

01:34:22.120 --> 01:34:24.793
...sand his lots. Got it.

01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:26.871
Go get 'em, Kev.

01:34:26.960 --> 01:34:32.159
- I'll be by tomorrow to say goodbye.
- Wait. Where are you goin'?

01:34:32.240 --> 01:34:34.231
We're going back tomorrow.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:36.470
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.432
Is the couch OK?

01:34:46.520 --> 01:34:49.557
Yeah, yeah. It's fine.

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.870
Sorry about tonight.

01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:54.712
- I had fun.
- Yeah?

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.031
It's pretty lively around here.

01:34:58.120 --> 01:35:00.998
So how come
you're coming back with me?

01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:04.038
I don't know. Cos I want to.

01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:11.711
- I'm not gonna take that sales job.
- I don't think you should.

01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:15.918
- How come?
- Piano players are sexy.

01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.992
Salesmen are uncles.

01:35:19.080 --> 01:35:21.036
And uncles aren't sexy.

01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:23.031
Not usually.

01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.557
Wait, wait. This is so weird.

01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:37.154
You've never had sex in here before?

01:35:37.240 --> 01:35:39.629
Not with another person.

01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:51.317
So...

01:35:53.480 --> 01:35:56.756
So how are you holding up?
Are you in pain?

01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:58.478
I'm OK.

01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:04.951
You look nice.

01:36:05.040 --> 01:36:08.510
Thanks. I was on a date.

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:15.356
- Did you have fun?
- It was OK.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:18.352
It's weird.

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:22.196
What is?

01:36:22.280 --> 01:36:26.910
I'm just lying here
and I'm wondering...

01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:30.196
how I got here, you know?

01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:36.908
I don't mean here,
I mean how I got here...

01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:40.117
How I'm not anything like...

01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:43.317
what I'd hoped that I'd be,
you know?

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.154
I'm not even close to the guy
I thought I'd end up being.

01:36:58.800 --> 01:37:01.314
And it kind of blows.

01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:03.992
You know?

01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:12.028
When I think about that guy
that I thought I was gonna be...

01:37:15.360 --> 01:37:17.237
there's a...

01:37:18.360 --> 01:37:23.115
there's this girl next to him,
with him...

01:37:25.560 --> 01:37:28.438
and I don't know...

01:37:30.000 --> 01:37:32.116
she looks sorta like you.

01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:37.751
- Sorta?
- Exactly.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.033
Exactly sorta.

01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:57.310
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:39:00.560 --> 01:39:02.516
You look excellent.

01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.637
Did you guys fuck up Rossmore?

01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:11.589
No, we put the fear of God into him.
He was a real shit.

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:16.838
- He had a right to be pissed.
- How's she doing?

01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.513
She's fine.

01:39:19.600 --> 01:39:22.717
Yeah. You're not gonna fuck it up
with her, are you?

01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:27.951
What do you think?

01:39:28.040 --> 01:39:33.034
She's one of the good ones. Why
do we always fuck up the good ones?

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:37.239
I don't know.
I've been pretty successful at it.

01:39:39.160 --> 01:39:41.913
Listen, I just came by
to say goodbye.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:44.719
- I'm taking off.
- Taking off?

01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:47.360
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:50.512
Listen, maybe
I'll come down and visit.

01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:53.433
Yeah, right. Like, what, spring?

01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:56.671
- Spring.
- Spring.

01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:58.509
Hey.

01:39:58.600 --> 01:40:02.912
- Don't be a stranger.
- All right. Take care of each other.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.150
Right.

01:40:06.040 --> 01:40:09.715
- Surprise!
- Oh, shit!

01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:12.673
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:16.958
- Tough guy, how you feelin'?
- I've been better. You takin' off?

01:40:17.040 --> 01:40:19.076
Yeah, I'm goin' home.

01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:23.790
- Listen, say goodbye to Sarah.
- Say goodbye to Tracy.

01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:26.269
You figure any of that shit out?

01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:28.510
You know. I'm working on it.

01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:30.591
Good.

01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:33.797
- I better get in there.
- See you soon.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.474
All right, buddy. I love you, man.

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:41.273
How you doin', bud?

01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:53.433
- I'm not used to this snow.
- How long is the drive?

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.956
About five or six hours.
If he drives, for sure five...

01:40:58.320 --> 01:41:02.199
- You'll have nice weather.
- It won't be too bad.

01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:04.350
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

01:41:04.440 --> 01:41:07.113
- Front or back?
- Back is good.

01:41:31.680 --> 01:41:34.319
Word is Jan and Victor
are engaged, Willie.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:37.995
- How do you feel?
- She drains me. They're all sisters.

01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:39.513
Each and every one.

01:41:39.600 --> 01:41:41.955
- Yo, Willie boy.
- Hey.

01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.112
- So you outta here?
- Yep.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:47.236
She is a honey-limbed lovely.

01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:49.117
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.

01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:51.509
- Have a safe ride.
- Trace.

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.998
This is Marty. Marty, Tracy.

01:41:55.080 --> 01:41:57.833
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- You, too.

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.754
- OK. Take care, big guy.
- Thanks.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:08.112
See you.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:14.232
- You ready?
- Yeah.

01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.673
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:23.511
Bye, Marty.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.556
Later, Pooh.

01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:43.870
Come back and see us, Will.

01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:47.589
We'll be right here.
Nothing changes here but the seasons.

01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:01.035
So you're
the little neighbourhood Lolita?

01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:04.908
So you're the alcoholic,
high school buddy shit-for-brains?

01:43:05.200 --> 01:43:08.510
That little girl was cute.
What was her name? Marcy?

01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:10.431
No, no. Marty.

01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.239
- Is it Martha?
- No, as in Martin.

01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:16.471
Named after a grandfather
she never even knew.

01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.878
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:43:22.960 --> 01:43:24.757
Yeah, I am.

01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:26.592
Superb.

01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:38.799
Willie C!

01:43:39.720 --> 01:43:41.756
Take care, man.

01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.796
Stay cool. Stay cool forever.

01:43:43.880 --> 01:43:45.472
All right, Kev.
