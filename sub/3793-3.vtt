01:23.483 --> 01:25.246
I can't believe this.

01:25.285 --> 01:28.516
The guy finally hooks up with Justine
Chapin and he won't tell us nothing.

01:28.555 --> 01:30.386
I told you, Turtle,
we had a good time.

01:30.423 --> 01:32.516
Come on, Vin.
Need little more info than that.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.119
Besides, since when don't we share
the details of our love life?

01:35.161 --> 01:37.459
Since you shared the details
of the girl with the anal warts.

01:37.497 --> 01:39.965
That was therapy,
not entertainment.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.092
Just give the little perv
something, bro.

01:42.135 --> 01:44.535
He won't stop nagging till he
gets what he wants.

01:44.571 --> 01:47.301
- Like you don't want to know?
- I have my own sex life to jerk off to.

01:47.340 --> 01:49.740
Uh, correction...
you had your own sex life.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.641
I mean, it was virtual,
but now it's over.

01:51.678 --> 01:53.009
- Turtle!
- What?

01:53.046 --> 01:55.139
No, it's okay, bro.
He's right. It's over.

01:55.181 --> 01:57.479
Jacqueline was
just another hozy

01:57.517 --> 02:00.315
who tore my heart out of my chest
and handed it to me.

02:00.353 --> 02:02.150
So laugh at me.
Whatever.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.782
I'm not laughing, Drama.
I'm just curious what a "hozy" is.

02:04.824 --> 02:07.452
It's a ho and a floozy, E.
And as it turns out,

02:07.494 --> 02:08.893
Jacqueline
was both.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.828
We'll get you
through it, Johnny.

02:10.864 --> 02:12.593
Let's cross here.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.835
We got it, come on.

02:17.871 --> 02:20.339
Keep your eyes
closed, Daddy!

02:20.373 --> 02:22.398
They're closed, buddy.
They're closed.

02:22.442 --> 02:23.909
- He's peeking.
- I'm not peeking.

02:23.943 --> 02:26.241
Why do women never
trust me, honey? Come on.

02:26.279 --> 02:27.610
Okay, we're almost there.
Just a couple more steps.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.239
All right.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.476
- A couple more.
- Okay.

02:30.517 --> 02:31.916
- Okay.
- All right.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.714
All right, stop now.
Open your eyes.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.512
Fuck me!

02:36.556 --> 02:38.547
- Daddy!
- I'm sorry, buddy, I'm sorry.

02:38.591 --> 02:40.024
- But holy sh...
- Ari!

02:40.059 --> 02:42.118
Baby, what is this?

02:42.162 --> 02:44.596
Happy... anniversary.

02:44.631 --> 02:47.623
I don't... baby, my gift does not
compare to that.

02:47.667 --> 02:49.999
Oh, don't worry.
I got myself something to make up for it.

02:50.036 --> 02:52.869
Oh my God, remember how much
I wanted this when I was 25?

02:52.906 --> 02:54.965
- Now you have it.
- But I'm not 25.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.000
Well, maybe it'll make you
feel like you are.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.510
- Can I drive?
- Never.

03:03.383 --> 03:06.011
Oh man!

03:06.052 --> 03:08.020
I know things
are bad, Marvin.

03:08.054 --> 03:11.114
Bad was last year.
Things are fucking disastrous now.

03:11.157 --> 03:13.557
You're like Katrina
with a black card.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.357
- I've been broke before.
- You're not broke... you're bankrupt.

03:16.396 --> 03:18.057
You've got to
file Chapter 11.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.894
I'm not filing
Chapter 11.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.834
You've got to wipe
the slate clean and start all over again.

03:22.869 --> 03:25.861
And this time on a budget
and without dependents.

03:25.905 --> 03:27.395
Should I just get
an appetizer?

03:27.440 --> 03:28.907
You should go
on a hunger strike.

03:28.942 --> 03:32.070
Vince, this is no time
to be proud.

03:32.111 --> 03:33.874
Marvin, my father
filed bankruptcy,

03:33.913 --> 03:36.347
left my mother with nothing...
not even child support.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.942
So call it pride, whatever you want,
I'm not going to do it.

03:38.985 --> 03:42.045
You're a better man than me, bro.
I filed three times.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.851
Maybe that's why
I'm alone.

03:43.890 --> 03:45.721
Maybe it's because
you're fucking ugly.

03:46.726 --> 03:48.387
All right, Vince,
don't file.

03:48.428 --> 03:49.918
But get a job,
and fast.

03:49.963 --> 03:52.193
There's nothing out there
to grab that quick.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.223
Oh no? Call Shauna.
She's just got

03:54.267 --> 03:57.202
a client we share
an appearance deal in Dubai.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.171
They pay big money
for girls over there.

03:59.205 --> 04:02.800
It was Michael Buble, moron.
And all he had to do

04:02.842 --> 04:04.935
was show up at a camel race.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.209
A camel race?
Doesn't sound too bad, huh?

04:21.394 --> 04:24.090
Wow, nice car, Ari.

04:24.130 --> 04:26.564
Anniversary gift from the wife.
Thanks, Davies.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.090
Oh, that's right, I forgot...
you married into money.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.864
Good for you, Ari.
Good for you.

04:30.903 --> 04:32.894
We only use her money
for the small stuff.

04:32.939 --> 04:35.772
Someday when you're done
sucking on Terrance's tit,

04:35.808 --> 04:38.436
you might want to get yourself
into a man's car like this.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.345
Breathe deep, Ari...

04:42.415 --> 04:44.610
here comes the dust.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.588
Fuck it.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.297
Easy, Ari.

05:08.341 --> 05:11.174
What do you say we race
for pink slips?

05:11.210 --> 05:15.010
I was thinking about getting
that car for my daughter for her Sweet 16.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.948
Your daughter's
almost 16, huh, Ari?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.678
Two more years
and she's legal.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.913
- Watch it, Davies.
- Or what?

05:20.953 --> 05:22.887
You couldn't catch me
if you wanted to.

05:22.922 --> 05:25.584
100 bucks says I pass
Bijan before you.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.490
Bijan?
You really are a bitch.

05:27.527 --> 05:29.154
But you're on!

06:12.839 --> 06:14.864
Christy, where
the fuck are you?

06:14.907 --> 06:18.035
I thought you said you were going to
speak nicer to me in front of the clients.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.204
File a labor grievance.
In the meantime,

06:20.246 --> 06:22.737
do we have any appearances
that Vincent can do?

06:22.782 --> 06:25.979
Actually I just got a call from some guy
in Bel Air about his daughter's Sweet 16.

06:26.018 --> 06:28.919
Zac Efron was supposed to do it,
but his appendix exploded.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.889
Great. Call him back
and tell him we have an actor

06:30.923 --> 06:32.686
whose testicles
have actually dropped.

06:32.725 --> 06:34.352
But tell him that Vince
won't do it

06:34.394 --> 06:36.362
for a dime less than
Zachary was getting.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.421
Wow, maybe we should have
Shauna call the studios.

06:38.464 --> 06:39.624
Yeah, if she can close.

06:39.665 --> 06:43.260
Oh, I'll close, Eric. These people would
be lucky to have you, Vincent.

06:43.302 --> 06:44.599
Let's make it a two-fer, Shauna.

06:44.637 --> 06:46.935
This way the Chase brothers
can wipe them out clean.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.066
Stick to
chili festivals, Drama.

06:49.108 --> 06:50.871
What the fuck
does that mean?

06:50.910 --> 06:53.378
It means that you're
far from a Sweet Sixteener's wet dream.

06:58.618 --> 07:00.984
I'll be outside, fellas.

07:01.020 --> 07:02.749
What's he so
sensitive about?

07:02.789 --> 07:04.256
He's going through
a rough breakup.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.282
Someone went out with him?

07:07.326 --> 07:09.021
- Hello?
- It's Amanda.

07:09.061 --> 07:10.858
- Oh, hey.
- This a good time?

07:10.897 --> 07:13.525
- Yeah, what's up?
- I am impressed with your taste, Eric.

07:13.566 --> 07:14.590
Oh yeah?

07:14.634 --> 07:16.295
That's a very good script
you gave me... very good.

07:16.335 --> 07:18.701
- Yeah, I thought so.
- I sent it to Edward Norton

07:18.738 --> 07:20.968
'cause I have a feeling
he may just respond to it.

07:21.007 --> 07:23.441
- Ed Norton?
- Yes, I hope that was okay.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.773
- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.369
I'll let you know
when I hear something.

07:26.412 --> 07:28.676
- Say hi to Vince.
- All right, thanks, Amanda.

07:30.149 --> 07:31.173
Amanda says hi.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.616
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.313
- She liked "Nine Brave Souls."
- Really?

07:34.353 --> 07:36.412
She wants to give it
to Ed Norton.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.390
Oh.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.119
They're excited
about Vince,

07:40.159 --> 07:42.093
but they'd like to meet him
before they commit.

07:42.128 --> 07:45.120
- I can't even book a Sweet 16?
- Oh, it's just a formality.

07:45.164 --> 07:46.961
Go there,
be your charming self,

07:46.999 --> 07:48.864
but leave Turtle and Drama
in the car, okay?

07:50.536 --> 07:52.436
I was worried
about you, Ari.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.804
You're never late and you
always answer your cell.

07:54.841 --> 07:57.207
Yeah, well, I had a little
problem with the Ferrari.

07:57.243 --> 07:58.972
- Already?
- Yep.

07:59.011 --> 08:01.639
I was involved in some
illegal street-racing.

08:01.681 --> 08:04.013
- Oooh, sexy.
- With Adam Davies.

08:04.050 --> 08:07.884
- Ewww, gross.
- Yep, and I lost so I owe him 100 bucks.

08:07.920 --> 08:09.979
Oh, fuck Adam Davies.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.320
I'd like to see him come here
and try and collect.

08:12.358 --> 08:15.725
Well, my confidence grows tenfold
knowing that you have my back, Lloyd.

08:15.761 --> 08:18.229
But I don't welch.
So here is $100.

08:18.264 --> 08:20.232
Please put it in
a brown paper bag

08:20.266 --> 08:21.995
along with a nice
big pile of shit

08:22.034 --> 08:23.865
and send it
over there.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.098
- Excuse me...
- Human shit, Lloyd.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.368
- Right now.
- That is really disgusting, Ari.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.102
No, really disgusting
is going to be

08:30.142 --> 08:32.076
the "American Psycho"
style dismemberment

08:32.111 --> 08:35.638
I am going to perform on you if you don't
do that right fucking now.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.486
- What about doggy poo?
- Human shit, Lloyd!

08:40.520 --> 08:44.081
Yours, if it's easier. Otherwise, go camp
out in the men's bathroom

08:44.123 --> 08:47.615
or the women's bathroom, whichever
will have you, but I need a specimen.

08:51.564 --> 08:53.327
- What?
- That's a nice greeting

08:53.366 --> 08:55.732
the Miller Gold Agency's
got going on there, Ari.

08:55.768 --> 08:58.032
Listen, if I knew it was you,
it would have been a lot worse.

08:58.070 --> 09:00.095
- What?
- I want you to know that we're on our way

09:00.139 --> 09:02.369
to try to land Vince
a Sweet 16 appearance gig.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.706
Jesus!

09:04.744 --> 09:08.202
Yeah, meanwhile the script I sent you
last week is on its way to Ed Norton.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.078
- Really?
- Yeah, "Nine Brave Souls."

09:10.116 --> 09:11.481
Amanda liked it.

09:11.517 --> 09:13.007
Yeah, we all know
what great taste she has.

09:13.052 --> 09:17.318
- Vince needs a job, Ari.
- I understand that, Eric.

09:17.356 --> 09:21.258
But you need to understand that you
are the reason he doesn't have one.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.422
Vince needs a studio movie.
Not an indie.

09:24.463 --> 09:27.432
So don't waste my fucking
time with the possibility

09:27.466 --> 09:30.333
that maybe Ed Norton might read
or may not read some fucking script

09:30.369 --> 09:33.099
that may or may not be good
because some half-ass agent

09:33.139 --> 09:36.734
who couldn't carry
my sperm sample likes it.

09:36.776 --> 09:39.609
- Okay?
- Yeah, okay.

09:39.645 --> 09:41.875
- Does he have anything?
- Yeah, he's got a few leads.

09:41.914 --> 09:43.779
What was he yelling about?

09:43.816 --> 09:45.977
Ah, you know Ari.
He's just stressed.

09:46.018 --> 09:49.613
- Everybody seems to be today.
- The moon must be in retrograde.

10:00.533 --> 10:03.195
- Yes?
- How are you doing?

10:03.235 --> 10:05.396
I have Vincent Chase
for the Sweet 16 meet.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.635
Come through. And please take your shoes
off at the front door.

10:16.215 --> 10:18.274
I'm not taking off
my fucking shoes.

10:18.317 --> 10:21.115
What's the problem, Drama?
You make people do it at your place.

10:21.153 --> 10:23.383
I just broke up with someone, Turtle.
I'm exhausted.

10:23.422 --> 10:25.481
Mr. Levine is waiting for you.
This way, please.

10:25.524 --> 10:27.924
You're about to die
with blood on.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.825
Let's get him!

10:29.862 --> 10:32.729
Mr. Bob, your 2:00
is here.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.790
Oh, welcome.
Please come in.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.098
Oh, guys, I'm so happy you're here.
Bob Levine.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.433
- How are you?
- Eric Murphy.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.802
- Nice to meet you.
- Vince.

10:39.839 --> 10:41.636
- Please, of course.
- How are you, Bob?

10:41.674 --> 10:43.198
- How are you? Nice to see you.
- Hey.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.403
Hey, Mitchell, say hello
to Mr. Chase and his friends.

10:45.444 --> 10:48.106
- Hey.
- I'm so happy you're here in my home.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.808
I'm such a fan.

10:49.849 --> 10:51.840
Now who wants
some Johnny Blue?

10:51.884 --> 10:53.317
- Johnny does.
- I'm driving.

10:53.352 --> 10:54.546
- Why not?
- I'm working.

10:54.587 --> 10:56.350
- All right.
- In fact, make mine a double.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.483
- Coming up.
- Hello, everybody, hello.

10:59.525 --> 11:02.790
- I thought we said 2:00?
- We came right from Shauna's office.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.763
All right, it's 2:30 and I am
extremely pressed for time.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.198
That Zac Efron
really fucked me over.

11:08.234 --> 11:11.897
But my son tells me my daughter's going
to be absolutely thrilled with you.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.700
- Right, Mitchy?
- Uh-huh.

11:13.739 --> 11:16.469
Oh, what are you doing
with your shoes on?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.704
Please take your shoes off.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.904
Take your shoes off,
Johnny.

11:25.818 --> 11:28.514
Now I don't know what
my husband told you,

11:28.554 --> 11:31.546
but tonight is extremely
important to both of us.

11:31.590 --> 11:34.150
Ah yes, we're spending
just over a million

11:34.193 --> 11:35.888
on our sweet baby girl.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.327
That's some Sweet 16.

11:37.363 --> 11:39.024
You don't know
the half of it.

11:39.065 --> 11:42.057
We're gonna be swimming
in an ocean of Cristal.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.069
I've got enough Almas
Russian-gold caviar

11:44.103 --> 11:47.664
for 300 guests, so, please,
don't come on an empty stomach!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.937
Okay, so Efron was supposed
to do a performance.

11:49.975 --> 11:51.237
Now what can you do?

11:51.277 --> 11:53.745
Uh, I act.

11:53.779 --> 11:55.974
What else can you do?

11:56.015 --> 11:58.609
Vince would love
to make an appearance, greet guests,

11:58.651 --> 12:01.211
have a dance with your daughter.
How does that sound?

12:01.253 --> 12:02.811
- Nice.
- Boring.

12:02.855 --> 12:05.187
- She doesn't do boring.
- No, I need flashy.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.988
She needs someone to take
that stick out of her ass.

12:08.027 --> 12:10.723
- Excuse me?
- Vince was Aquaman,

12:10.763 --> 12:13.254
ma'am, star of the highest
grossing film of all time.

12:13.299 --> 12:16.564
Aquaman, Aquaman, yes.

12:16.602 --> 12:18.593
Yes, okay...

12:18.637 --> 12:21.265
and what is Aquaman known
for again, Mitchell?

12:21.307 --> 12:24.868
He's king of the ocean. He can dehydrate
his opponent with a single touch.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.140
- Right.
- Sweetheart, what if...

12:27.179 --> 12:29.272
Okay, here's what
I'm thinking.

12:29.315 --> 12:31.909
We will have Vince
dressed as Aquaman,

12:31.951 --> 12:35.512
unveil him at the party
sitting in an ice throne

12:35.554 --> 12:37.784
- in the middle of the pool.
- Are you serious?

12:37.823 --> 12:40.553
All of the tables surround
the hotel pool

12:40.593 --> 12:42.561
and you will be like
a living centerpiece

12:42.595 --> 12:44.790
for everyone to see.
I love this.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.355
Five hours on an iceberg
could get a bit chilly, huh?

12:47.399 --> 12:50.027
- Sweetie?
- 200 Gs warm you up, Vince?

12:50.069 --> 12:52.060
Fuck that.
I'd rather be bankrupt.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.038
Turtle, you know how you
drive in "Grand Theft Auto"?

12:54.073 --> 12:55.404
Way ahead of you, Vin.

12:55.441 --> 12:57.739
- What a waste of time.
- Not a total waste.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.645
- Oh, you boosted their Scotch, Johnny?
- Fuck 'em.

13:01.680 --> 13:03.910
The way they insulted you, bro,
they had it coming.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.940
Let's get hammered like
it's St. Paddy's day.

13:05.985 --> 13:07.111
I know a place.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.084
Look at this shit, man:
Gangster,

13:14.126 --> 13:16.390
drug dealer, rapper.
Pffft!

13:16.428 --> 13:18.419
I may as well be playing
my fucking self.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.159
Listen, what, do you want
to play Othello?

13:20.199 --> 13:22.497
No, I want to do
"Black Sabbath."

13:22.535 --> 13:25.003
- The Ozzy Osbourne story?
- It's actually a story

13:25.037 --> 13:27.028
about a young black
supermarket checker

13:27.072 --> 13:29.006
who falls in love
with an older Jewish woman.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.771
- And I'm thinking Meryl Streep.
- We love Meryl Streep, Ari.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.075
Meryl Streep is good.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.013
It's set against
the Crown Heights riots.

13:36.048 --> 13:38.175
- Any love scenes?
- Three.

13:38.217 --> 13:40.276
- I mean, I could pull it off.
- Mr. Gold?

13:40.319 --> 13:41.411
Yes.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.580
I'm Officer Nickerson.
This is Officer Morgan.

13:43.622 --> 13:46.147
- Officer?
- Is this about the car accident?

13:46.192 --> 13:49.491
No, sir, this is about that bag of feces
you sent one Adam Davies today.

13:49.528 --> 13:51.462
What about it?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.158
That sounds like an admission
of guilt to me.

13:53.199 --> 13:55.360
- Cuff him, Bill.
- No no, hold on a second.

13:55.401 --> 13:56.834
Wait a minute!
Hold on a second.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.860
Since when is sending
someone a present a crime?

13:58.904 --> 14:00.872
Since we say
it is, Mr. Gold.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.965
You are literally
on some sick shit, Ari.

14:03.008 --> 14:04.532
Mr. Gold, if you cooperate,

14:04.577 --> 14:06.875
we'll make this as pleasant an experience
as we can for you.

14:09.148 --> 14:10.843
Wait a minute, wait!
What is this?

14:10.883 --> 14:14.842
- Who are you guys?
- BHPD... Boner Patrol.

14:14.887 --> 14:16.787
Oh, please...
oh come on!

14:16.822 --> 14:19.484
You're about to get
your stiffy inspected.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.720
- Oh my God!
- Lloyd!

14:22.862 --> 14:23.954
Lloyd!

14:23.996 --> 14:26.021
- I'm outta here, Ari.
- Hold on, TI.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.226
Call me when you're done
with your entertainment.

14:28.267 --> 14:30.735
Lloyd, you speak their language.
Make it stop!

14:30.769 --> 14:32.396
Lt'll be over soon, Ari.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.998
Just close your eyes
and think of pussy.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.480
I hope you're not calling me for a release
on your hard on, Ari.

14:43.515 --> 14:45.415
I'd call your mother
for that, Davies.

14:45.451 --> 14:48.682
I actually want to talk to you
about a little misunderstanding.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.053
See, practical jokes
are for friends.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.648
And we ain't friends.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.659
It wasn't a joke, Ari,
it was torture.

14:54.693 --> 14:57.355
Get used to it, pal,
'cause it's gonna keep coming.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.660
Like the Terminator,
I cannot be stopped.

14:59.698 --> 15:02.599
This is a very dangerous game
you're playing, Davies.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.866
Ari, I am going to fuck
with you day and night.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.203
You know why?
Because I'm younger,

15:08.240 --> 15:10.367
cooler
and better looking than you.

15:10.409 --> 15:12.741
And because I can.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.611
This means war, Lloyd.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.549
I thought it was war
when I sent him shit this morning.

15:18.584 --> 15:22.179
Look, I'm about to tell you something
that stays with us, all right?

15:22.221 --> 15:24.382
And is not to be shared
with Mrs. Ari.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.551
Now I know you don't know the man code,
so I want you to swear

15:27.593 --> 15:31.029
on Tom getting gangrene
on his cock that you will say nothing.

15:31.063 --> 15:33.395
- I won't utter a word.
- All right.

15:33.432 --> 15:36.595
Davies' girlfriend back
in the day made a play for me

15:36.635 --> 15:38.899
when she was humping
a pushcart in the mailroom.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.202
I didn't do anything,
but I saved the evidence.

15:41.240 --> 15:42.832
Slut!

15:42.875 --> 15:44.638
What are you going
to do with these, Ari?

15:44.677 --> 15:48.340
I am going to send these to Davies
and I'm going to shatter his world

15:48.380 --> 15:51.747
because a shattered world is what you
get when you mess with Ari Gold.

15:51.784 --> 15:56.084
Well, if you ask me, Ari Gold should rise up
and be the bigger man.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.146
Well, unlike your world
where the bigger man

15:58.190 --> 15:59.987
pounds the smaller man
from behind,

16:00.025 --> 16:03.461
the bigger man in my world
is the last man standing.

16:03.495 --> 16:05.622
And that man will
be me, all right?

16:05.664 --> 16:06.995
So I want you to send
those pictures

16:07.032 --> 16:09.500
and let's watch
the atom bomb explode.

16:13.072 --> 16:16.633
Hos, hos and more hos.
I can't believe you guys dragged me here.

16:16.675 --> 16:20.133
- You used to love Crazy Girls.
- I used to love a lot of things, bro.

16:20.179 --> 16:21.669
But a lot of things
just didn't love me back.

16:21.714 --> 16:22.806
Hey, guys.

16:22.848 --> 16:24.975
Save it, honey.
We're anti-women here.

16:25.017 --> 16:28.009
Real smooth, Drama, nice.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.450
- Marvin.
- Voicemail.

16:32.491 --> 16:34.823
Maybe we should just
eBay-off everything we own.

16:34.860 --> 16:36.987
We don't own that much.
Most of it's leased.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.623
Auction that shit off anyway.
It'll be somebody else's problem.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.633
- Great idea, Turtle.
- We're not gonna panic.

16:41.667 --> 16:44.659
It's gonna work out someway somehow.
What is it you always say, Vince?

16:44.703 --> 16:46.671
Lt'll work out.
It always does, right?

16:46.705 --> 16:48.002
- I used to say that?
- Yeah.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.837
Hear hear!
Life sucks.

16:51.710 --> 16:53.007
Hey, Shauna.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.412
It ain't Shauna, Eric. It's Marvin.
Stop ducking my fucking phone calls.

16:56.448 --> 16:58.279
It's Shauna too, Eric.
You're on conference.

16:58.317 --> 17:01.150
- What's going on?
- What's going on is your client ducked out

17:01.186 --> 17:03.848
- on a $200,000 appearance fee.
- Yeah, I know. I was there.

17:03.889 --> 17:06.380
Didn't I stress the importance
of income this morning?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.222
Yeah, you did, but it
wasn't the right offer.

17:08.260 --> 17:10.955
We know all about it, Eric.
I spoke to Levine personally.

17:10.996 --> 17:13.464
He'll pay Vincent
200 grand just to serenade

17:13.499 --> 17:15.523
the birthday girl with that bullshit
"I Love You, Baby" song

17:15.567 --> 17:18.194
from Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.
Can Vincent handle that?

17:18.237 --> 17:19.670
That's why I'm on
the phone, Eric,

17:19.704 --> 17:21.605
- to say he fucking better.
- You got 200 grand.

17:21.640 --> 17:24.404
All you gotta do is sing "I Can't Take
my Eyes Off of You" to the kid.

17:24.443 --> 17:26.035
No iceberg?

17:26.078 --> 17:28.342
- He's in.
- Great, I'll notify the Levines.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.541
I'll see you here tomorrow
morning with the check, Eric.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.947
I'll talk
to you guys later.

17:33.252 --> 17:35.277
- We're back in business.
- It's about time!

17:35.320 --> 17:37.914
What do you say we spend
some of that cash on some dancing?

17:37.956 --> 17:39.685
I thought
you'd never ask.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.590
Traitorous scum.

17:43.762 --> 17:45.889
It's coming, Lloyd.
It's coming.

17:45.931 --> 17:47.558
When, Ari, when?

17:47.599 --> 17:50.762
- Now, Lloyd.
- Ari Gold's office.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.567
Just one moment,
Mr. Davies.

17:53.605 --> 17:56.369
Can you smell it, Lloyd?
You know what that smells like?

17:56.408 --> 17:58.603
Defeat.
Surrender is imminent.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.737
- I feel bad for him now.
- Fuck him!

18:00.779 --> 18:02.940
Like the great philosopher
Sun Tzu said,

18:02.981 --> 18:06.246
"When you're done fucking your enemies,
fuck them some more."

18:06.285 --> 18:08.515
I took philosophy
and Sun Tzu did not say that, Ari.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.681
I'm paraphrasing, whatever.
Put him through.

18:10.722 --> 18:12.519
Davies!

18:14.493 --> 18:16.188
Bravo, Ari, bravo.

18:16.228 --> 18:19.129
Only I broke up with that whore
six months ago.

18:20.499 --> 18:22.831
- Bullshit you did.
- True shit, Ari.

18:22.868 --> 18:25.063
I'm fucking a Miami Heat
cheerleader now.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.629
If you don't believe me,
watch the game tomorrow night.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.800
I'll have her blow me
courtside for the cameras.

18:29.842 --> 18:32.811
Yeah, but it's still gotta
sting knowing the entire time

18:32.845 --> 18:36.406
you were fucking your ex,
she was dreaming of getting stuffed by me.

18:36.448 --> 18:40.111
Please, Ari, you were hardly the only guy
around here she offered to fuck.

18:40.152 --> 18:43.644
Word is she took on the whole new-media
division at the La Quinta retreat.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.987
Whatever, Davies.
Either way, we're done!

18:46.024 --> 18:48.288
Done?

18:49.862 --> 18:52.126
Not quite, pal.

18:52.164 --> 18:53.893
Check your email.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.560
I, uh, think you're
gonna like it.

18:57.769 --> 18:59.999
I found it
on the World Wide Web.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.206
The missus!

19:03.242 --> 19:06.973
It's from a little-known
piece of cinema called "Hardbodies 3."

19:07.012 --> 19:08.877
Did you book
that job for her?

19:09.882 --> 19:11.713
Breathe, Ari, breathe.

19:14.686 --> 19:17.484
Ari Gold!
Wait for backup!

19:23.762 --> 19:26.458
Please, Ari, let me
at least call your therapist.

19:26.498 --> 19:28.295
Adam Davies,
I'm looking for you!

19:28.333 --> 19:30.267
Mr. Gold, Mr. Gold!

19:30.302 --> 19:32.031
I'm back!

19:33.172 --> 19:36.232
Davies,
where are you?

19:37.376 --> 19:41.107
Adam Davies, this is
your unlucky day.

19:42.114 --> 19:43.342
Davies.

19:44.383 --> 19:46.442
Adam Davies.

19:46.485 --> 19:49.113
Bring your bitch-ass
out here.

19:49.154 --> 19:51.782
Davies!

19:51.823 --> 19:54.257
Are you serious
coming here like this, Ari?

19:58.664 --> 20:02.065
Games are games, Davies,
but that is the mother of my children.

20:02.100 --> 20:05.069
So apologize
or I will kick your ass

20:05.103 --> 20:07.594
in front of your entire
deadbeat agency.

20:11.176 --> 20:14.441
That is what we call a "bitch slap."
A bitch slap for a bitch.

20:14.479 --> 20:17.414
What do you say we go outside
and finish it off, huh?

20:17.449 --> 20:20.247
- You are going down for this, Ari.
- I don't really care.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.152
Now you apologize
for what you did

20:23.188 --> 20:26.214
or I'm going to
knock you the fuck out

20:26.258 --> 20:28.226
right here and right now.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.598
I'm gonna count to three.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.657
One...

20:36.802 --> 20:38.531
- I apologize.
- I can't hear you.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.367
I said...

20:40.405 --> 20:43.431
I'm sorry.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.009
Nice seeing
everybody again.

20:50.048 --> 20:51.572
Whew.

20:51.617 --> 20:53.107
Come on, Lloyd.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.585
Ari Gold, you have
fists of fury!

21:15.941 --> 21:17.670
Bartender, another.

21:17.709 --> 21:20.576
Jesus, Drama, don't you think you've
had enough for one day?

21:20.612 --> 21:22.477
What, are you
my sponsor?

21:22.514 --> 21:25.278
He's right, Drama. You're like Nick Cage
in "Leaving Las Vegas,"

21:25.317 --> 21:27.376
except you don't have
Elisabeth Shue to fuck.

21:27.419 --> 21:29.910
Elisabeth Shue played
a whore, Turtle.

21:29.955 --> 21:33.721
Need I say more? Hurry up, bartender.
I've got pain to numb.

21:33.759 --> 21:37.092
Mmm, you know what, Johnny?
I'll do another one with you.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.256
- Make it two.
- There you go again, bro.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.358
Proving my theory that
the only men in this gang

21:42.401 --> 21:44.995
with hair on their balls
are the Chase men.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.335
You all right?

21:47.372 --> 21:50.569
Yeah, you know, it's not exactly how
I imagined my life to go.

21:50.609 --> 21:52.474
But things could be worse.

21:52.511 --> 21:54.411
Things are going
up from here, I know it.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.641
How about my singing voice,
how's that gonna go?

21:56.682 --> 21:57.671
You're gonna be great.

21:57.716 --> 21:59.980
I've heard you sing it before
at J.P.'s bar back home.

22:00.018 --> 22:02.486
- Yeah, I was drunk, E.
- Here come the Levines.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.045
You're gonna be great.
Don't worry about it.

22:04.089 --> 22:05.283
Thanks.

22:05.324 --> 22:06.848
Good evening,
gentlemen.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.918
Please say hello to our
Sweet Sixteener Candace.

22:09.961 --> 22:13.192
- Hello, Candace, nice to meet you.
- You too, Vincent.

22:13.231 --> 22:15.665
- Future hozy.
- Uh-huh.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.328
Please excuse
the bandage.

22:17.369 --> 22:20.361
She hurt her nose
doing God-knows-what.

22:20.405 --> 22:22.373
Right after I just paid
20K for a nose job.

22:22.407 --> 22:23.635
- Bob!
- Dad!

22:23.675 --> 22:25.609
What, sweet plum?
It happened.

22:25.644 --> 22:27.635
Maybe I injured it
sucking my boyfriend's dick.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.203
Did you ever
think about that?

22:29.247 --> 22:31.078
Forget I said "future."

22:31.116 --> 22:33.482
- Don't talk to your father that way.
- Fuck you, Mom.

22:33.518 --> 22:36.976
I will go fuck this whole fucking party
right now if I fucking want to.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.991
Stop being such
a drama queen!

22:41.259 --> 22:43.193
- She's a sweet kid.
- Yeah!

22:43.228 --> 22:45.890
Teenager going
through a phase.

22:45.931 --> 22:48.297
That phase will last
a lifetime, Bob.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.426
He's kidding.

22:52.270 --> 22:54.238
Everybody, I'm home!

22:54.272 --> 22:56.240
Thank you, sweetie.

22:56.274 --> 22:59.539
- Why did Lloyd drop you off?
- I had a little mishap with the Ferrari.

22:59.578 --> 23:00.840
What?!

23:00.879 --> 23:03.006
- Daddy!
- There's my man.

23:03.048 --> 23:05.073
Oh ho ho!
Guess what?

23:05.117 --> 23:07.449
- Your daddy got you a gift.
- Whoa, cool.

23:07.486 --> 23:09.078
Cool is right.
And you know what?

23:09.121 --> 23:11.351
I'm gonna show you how to use them.
You want to know why?

23:11.390 --> 23:13.051
Because you're the strongest guy
in Hollywood?

23:13.091 --> 23:15.082
- I told you that already?
- Mm-hmm.

23:15.127 --> 23:16.992
Now it's official.
Boom, boom-boom.

23:17.028 --> 23:18.393
- Honey?
- Yeah, baby?

23:18.430 --> 23:20.489
What kind of mishap did you
get in with the Ferrari?

23:20.532 --> 23:23.399
Remember how you said the car
would make me feel 25 again?

23:23.435 --> 23:25.232
- Yes.
- It made me feel 18 again...

23:25.270 --> 23:27.261
- Whoo!
...and I'm going to prove it to you.

23:27.305 --> 23:30.172
- What about the kids?
- Sarah, take care of your brother.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.971
Mommy and Daddy have
a little conference.

23:32.010 --> 23:33.910
Are you still
taking me to dinner?

23:33.945 --> 23:35.435
- That's doubtful.
- Okay.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.316
That's not the only thing
she's going to be blowing tonight.

23:44.356 --> 23:47.723
- Will you shut up, Drama?
- Why don't you make me, E?

23:47.759 --> 23:50.125
Okay, everybody,

23:50.162 --> 23:53.563
we have a very special
surprise for you.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.465
Please give
a warm warm welcome

23:56.501 --> 24:00.801
to Mr. Vincent Chase
of "Aquaman" fame!

24:00.839 --> 24:02.898
Break a leg, bro.

24:02.941 --> 24:05.842
- Knock 'em dead.
- He's coming.

24:11.917 --> 24:14.215
Won't you please
say a few words?

24:16.087 --> 24:18.055
Well, I'm very happy
to be here

24:18.089 --> 24:20.580
with Candace on this
very special occasion.

24:20.625 --> 24:24.186
I know a way you could
make it more special, Vincent.

24:24.229 --> 24:26.459
Candace,
don't be a whore.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.830
Everybody,
Mr. Vincent Chase.

24:47.152 --> 24:49.313
I'm not letting him
go out like this.

24:49.354 --> 24:52.221
Not my bro.
Not tonight.

24:52.257 --> 24:54.157
What are you talking about?
He sounds great.

24:54.192 --> 24:56.456
- Stop it, Drama.
- Not to my ears he don't.

24:56.495 --> 24:59.020
Put your jacket on!

25:16.047 --> 25:18.607
- Yeah?
- Good news, Eric.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.141
- Ed Norton liked the script?
- He loved it.

25:21.186 --> 25:22.915
- He wants to do it.
- That's great.

25:22.954 --> 25:25.286
Only he sees it a little
bit bigger than scripted.

25:25.323 --> 25:27.723
He wants to see the fireman
battling the blaze

25:27.759 --> 25:30.728
instead of just sitting around
the firehouse talking about it.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.662
That sounds like a lot bigger
than a little bigger.

25:32.697 --> 25:34.358
He wants to make it
a studio film, Eric.

25:34.399 --> 25:35.798
Maybe get Ridley Scott
to direct it.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.598
And he thinks "Smokejumpers"
is a more evocative title

25:38.637 --> 25:40.730
than "Nine Brave Souls."
You okay with that?

25:40.772 --> 25:43.240
- Sure.
- Great. I'll let you know when I know more.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.436
Go back to your party.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.279
Yeah, Vincent Chase!

25:54.786 --> 25:56.276
Oh my God.

26:12.203 --> 26:15.400
Can you hear me, bitches?

26:25.383 --> 26:27.578
I hope you got
the money in advance.
