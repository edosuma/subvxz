00:24.894 --> 00:28.352
- Finally we're home, wait,
Dick, stop videotaping me.

00:28.376 --> 00:30.354
- Why?
- Why are you doing it?

00:30.378 --> 00:32.269
- Because I just, you know...

00:32.293 --> 00:36.142
- Who will you send it to?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.559
Stop videoing us.

00:38.995 --> 00:40.625
Come on. - Come on.

00:40.649 --> 00:43.715
- You're addicted to Snapchat.
- Uh, no, I'm just, you know.

00:43.739 --> 00:44.933
Addicted to that ass.

00:46.133 --> 00:48.372
- Why is the door open?
- I don't know.

00:48.396 --> 00:50.156
Maybe he's out and about.

00:50.180 --> 00:51.853
- Stop, stop!
- Okay.

00:54.706 --> 00:57.685
- It's so smoky, what is this?

00:57.709 --> 00:58.709
Girls?

01:00.756 --> 01:02.212
Girls!

01:05.369 --> 01:06.369
Claire?

01:07.589 --> 01:08.589
Tiff!

01:10.505 --> 01:11.743
Is that blood?

01:12.942 --> 01:15.877
- That looks like it.
- Is that blood?

01:15.901 --> 01:16.901
Tiff?

01:21.385 --> 01:24.060
- Let's go.
- Oh my god!

01:25.563 --> 01:28.740
Oh my god, oh my god,
call the police.

01:30.742 --> 01:34.920
♪ Then my love
could prove to you

01:37.271 --> 01:41.449
♪ That I would always
love you and be true

01:45.757 --> 01:49.935
♪ My plans and dreams
cannot come true

01:51.546 --> 01:55.439
♪ And when you say goodbye

01:55.463 --> 01:58.790
♪ I know I will cry

01:58.814 --> 02:02.905
♪ 'Cause I'll know it's
my last date with you

02:37.331 --> 02:38.331
- Claire.

02:39.376 --> 02:42.703
Can I talk to you for a second?

02:42.727 --> 02:44.903
- Go ahead, I'll catch up.

02:48.864 --> 02:50.039
- Would you...

02:52.824 --> 02:55.673
Would you like to go to the
Thriller Night Dance with me?

02:55.697 --> 03:00.678
- Matt, I'm really, really
honored you would ask me, but,

03:00.702 --> 03:02.854
I'm going with someone else.

03:02.878 --> 03:03.878
Sorry.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.684
- Tim Murphy?

03:06.708 --> 03:10.122
- He's kind of been my
boyfriend for a while now.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.212
- I heard you guys had...
- Broken up?

03:13.236 --> 03:15.519
High school, we had a fight.

03:15.543 --> 03:17.782
The rumor mill isn't
always accurate.

03:17.806 --> 03:18.807
- I'm sorry.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.220
- It's okay.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.594
Really, thank you for asking.

03:24.813 --> 03:27.052
I'm sure I'll see you there.

03:27.076 --> 03:28.053
- Claire.

03:28.077 --> 03:29.077
Hurry up.

03:30.340 --> 03:31.796
- Gotta go.

03:31.820 --> 03:35.345
Have a great day, Matt, and
don't be late for class.

05:18.666 --> 05:22.278
- In English, it means
tenacious pine tree.

05:23.714 --> 05:27.433
Shoshin Makaniri could easily
have given up when he took ill

05:27.457 --> 05:30.218
but he did not, Shoshin said,

05:30.242 --> 05:34.159
karate can be considered
conflict with oneself,

05:35.509 --> 05:38.792
or a lifelong battle
that can only be won

05:38.816 --> 05:42.187
through self-discipline,
hard training,

05:42.211 --> 05:45.103
and use of one's
creative efforts.

05:45.127 --> 05:47.714
But without self-discipline,

05:47.738 --> 05:51.414
it will consume you
and you will fail.

05:54.919 --> 05:56.114
Breathe!

05:56.138 --> 05:57.138
Breathe.

06:00.490 --> 06:01.490
Yes.

06:04.059 --> 06:05.365
Fighting stance.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.539
- Get off me, get off!

06:29.563 --> 06:30.453
Chill!

06:30.477 --> 06:32.217
Calm down, calm down!

06:39.747 --> 06:40.747
Get off!

06:44.621 --> 06:47.165
What the fuck is wrong with you?

06:47.189 --> 06:49.341
- Isn't it time to wake up?

06:56.938 --> 06:58.655
Welcome back to
Thriller Thursdays,

06:58.679 --> 07:00.961
and now back to our
feature presentation.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.967
- Just kill me already.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.166
You sick fuck.

07:21.745 --> 07:23.244
Just do it.

07:23.268 --> 07:24.444
Do it, fucker.

07:26.184 --> 07:29.599
Next Wednesday night.

07:41.678 --> 07:42.853
- There he is.

07:43.985 --> 07:45.682
A real Brewster, huh?

07:48.642 --> 07:50.165
Feeling good, kid?

07:52.036 --> 07:53.318
Hey.

07:53.342 --> 07:56.345
You gonna ignore me
in my own house?

07:58.434 --> 08:00.847
Can you believe
this little prick?

08:00.871 --> 08:03.763
- Joey...
- No, don't fuckin' "Joey" me.

08:03.787 --> 08:05.417
Kid's got no respect for no one.

08:05.441 --> 08:07.767
- I talked to him already.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.967
- Fuck you with your talk.

08:10.968 --> 08:12.970
I'll show him some talk.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.974
- I'll make you a sandwich.

08:20.064 --> 08:21.520
- I'll teach you respect.

08:21.544 --> 08:23.957
- Do you want turkey?

08:23.981 --> 08:25.156
- You hear me?

08:26.680 --> 08:27.681
- Joe?
- Hey!

08:31.902 --> 08:34.054
I said did you fuckin' hear me?

08:34.078 --> 08:37.710
- Joey, it's been a
really long day already.

08:37.734 --> 08:40.432
How about I make you a sandwich?

09:05.675 --> 09:07.198
- Did you hear me?

09:14.815 --> 09:15.618
- Joey!

09:15.642 --> 09:16.488
Joey, stop!

09:16.512 --> 09:17.512
Joey, no!

09:26.609 --> 09:30.744
- You're gonna learn respect,
or I'm gonna kill you.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.543
- Cool makeup.

10:05.996 --> 10:09.173
- Thriller Night Dance with me?

10:11.262 --> 10:13.023
- I'm honored you'd ask me.

10:13.047 --> 10:15.963
- You're gonna learn respect.

12:41.761 --> 12:42.761
- Claire.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.697
- Hey, Matt.

12:45.721 --> 12:48.134
When did you get here?

12:48.158 --> 12:49.614
When did you get here?

12:49.638 --> 12:51.050
- Just now.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.617
- Oh, cool.

12:52.641 --> 12:55.489
Well, I'm glad you made it,
it took forever to decorate.

12:55.513 --> 12:56.795
- Do you wanna dance?

13:00.431 --> 13:01.757
- What?

13:01.781 --> 13:04.498
- Do you wanna dance with me?

13:04.522 --> 13:08.285
- Um, it's probably
not the best idea.

13:08.309 --> 13:09.309
Jules!

13:13.444 --> 13:16.119
It's just Tim and I,
he's my boyfriend,

13:16.143 --> 13:17.511
and it's not the best.

13:17.535 --> 13:19.015
- Hey, freak-show!

13:27.458 --> 13:29.286
What's your deal, bro?

13:31.071 --> 13:32.071
Hello?

13:33.813 --> 13:35.162
Are you retarded?

13:36.293 --> 13:38.054
I said what's your deal?

13:38.078 --> 13:40.578
- He was just talking, Tim.

13:40.602 --> 13:41.602
- I know.

13:42.299 --> 13:44.277
I'm just talkin', too.

13:44.301 --> 13:46.453
- Just leave it, Tim, it's fine.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.412
- Babe, I know.

13:48.436 --> 13:49.436
It's fine.

13:51.221 --> 13:52.677
Just tryin' to have a
quick conversation

13:52.701 --> 13:54.853
with the big guy here.

13:54.877 --> 13:56.357
- Timmy, I said...

13:58.838 --> 13:59.838
It's fine.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.754
Now let's go for a walk.

14:05.670 --> 14:06.670
- Okay.

14:08.848 --> 14:09.848
Nevermind.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.154
My mistake.

14:15.115 --> 14:16.115
My mistake.

14:20.294 --> 14:22.165
Have a good night, bud.

14:32.915 --> 14:33.915
- Hudson!

14:35.135 --> 14:36.677
- Hudson!

14:36.701 --> 14:37.896
- Yo, karate chick.

14:37.920 --> 14:39.637
- Hey, Mattie, wait up a sec.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.334
Let me talk to you real quick.

14:41.358 --> 14:44.381
Hey, freak-show, turn around
and talk to me like a man.

14:44.405 --> 14:46.905
- Slow down, Speed Racer.

14:46.929 --> 14:47.929
- Aw, sorry.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.909
Did I say somethin' wrong?

14:50.933 --> 14:55.348
- What's that quote, um,
"Papa was a rolling stone?"

14:55.372 --> 14:59.048
I think that's how
the expression goes.

14:59.072 --> 15:00.876
- Aw, look at this.

15:00.900 --> 15:04.227
The thing is, you think
it's cool to come up

15:04.251 --> 15:08.492
and hit on my girlfriend in
front of the whole school.

15:08.516 --> 15:10.233
That won't do, bro.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.260
So you can imagine
my embarrassment.

15:15.915 --> 15:19.353
You have no respect
for what isn't yours.

15:21.572 --> 15:22.572
Freak.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.031
She's mine.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.143
She chose me.

15:29.450 --> 15:30.450
Me.

15:31.234 --> 15:32.234
Not you.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.934
She would never, ever,

15:36.065 --> 15:39.286
date a fatherless
retard like yourself.

15:40.765 --> 15:43.353
- Never.
- Yeah, like yourself.

15:43.377 --> 15:45.877
- Like you.

15:45.901 --> 15:46.901
- Ever.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.582
- He's want to get down, Tim!

15:55.606 --> 15:56.999
You got him, Tim.

15:59.132 --> 16:00.936
- You want some of Tim Murphy?

16:00.960 --> 16:02.763
The Tim Murphy?

16:05.486 --> 16:06.506
Come on.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.421
Come on, big guy.

16:08.445 --> 16:09.751
Come on, freak!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.821
- Kick his ass!

16:16.845 --> 16:19.500
- You like that? That feel good?

16:20.718 --> 16:22.720
- Come on, Tim.

16:57.494 --> 16:58.645
- Tim!

16:58.669 --> 16:59.669
Stop!

17:02.456 --> 17:03.456
Matthew!

17:12.509 --> 17:13.554
- It's okay.

17:14.642 --> 17:17.708
- What are you guys doing?

17:17.732 --> 17:18.883
Matthew! - You want more?

17:20.560 --> 17:21.560
- No!

17:25.566 --> 17:26.566
- Tim!

17:28.351 --> 17:29.502
Tim!

17:34.227 --> 17:35.073
Tim, are...

17:35.097 --> 17:36.031
- I'm good.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.771
- Tim, are you okay?

17:37.795 --> 17:39.338
- I'm good.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.362
- Tim!

17:42.148 --> 17:44.474
Call for help! - Tim!

17:44.498 --> 17:45.779
- Call for help!

17:45.803 --> 17:47.346
Baby, baby.

19:19.810 --> 19:20.810
- You okay?

19:22.596 --> 19:23.596
- I'm fine.

19:24.554 --> 19:25.554
- Carolina.

19:27.775 --> 19:28.950
What the fuck?

19:50.537 --> 19:51.537
- Claire?

20:13.342 --> 20:14.342
- Oh, fuck.

20:47.724 --> 20:48.724
Down.

20:49.509 --> 20:50.529
Down.

20:50.553 --> 20:52.662
Down.

21:01.477 --> 21:02.477
Water.

21:18.407 --> 21:23.214
Look, see now, I can hop
with four apples up on top.

21:23.238 --> 21:24.563
- One, two, three.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.043
One, two, three, four.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.722
- Perfect, look at you.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.855
Seven apples up on the top.

21:33.117 --> 21:35.922
- One, two, three,
four, five, six.

21:35.946 --> 21:38.795
Or, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven.

21:38.819 --> 21:42.494
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven.

21:42.518 --> 21:44.714
- That's right, what
a lucky number.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.322
- Claire.

22:05.759 --> 22:06.759
- Hey!

22:08.892 --> 22:11.131
- Hey, did you get my text?

22:11.155 --> 22:12.394
- My phone died.

22:12.418 --> 22:13.395
- Really?

22:13.419 --> 22:14.787
- Yeah.

22:14.811 --> 22:16.180
- Where were you?

22:16.204 --> 22:17.964
- Studying.

22:17.988 --> 22:20.140
- I went to your house
and no one was there.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.055
- I was over at Liz's.

22:22.079 --> 22:23.079
- With Liz?

22:23.907 --> 22:25.407
- Yes, with Liz.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.757
- And you couldn't send
me a text this morning?

22:27.781 --> 22:29.802
- I was working.

22:29.826 --> 22:31.804
- Look, I was worried, is all.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.415
I just, hey.

22:33.439 --> 22:35.330
I just don't like it when I
can't get in touch with you.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.636
- You don't have
to worry about me.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.769
- You're beautiful and.

22:39.793 --> 22:41.142
- Stop it.
- Hey.

22:52.936 --> 22:57.221
I, um, I gotta stop by
Coach Hern's office.

22:57.245 --> 22:59.658
I got practice
till five and then

22:59.682 --> 23:01.138
I'm gonna go downtown
for costume shopping.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.095
Choose your costume yet?

23:02.119 --> 23:03.401
- No, Jason.

23:03.425 --> 23:05.011
- Why?

23:05.035 --> 23:07.057
- I don't dress up.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.561
- Come on, Claire.

23:09.605 --> 23:10.887
- I don't!
- It's stupid.

23:10.911 --> 23:13.063
Everybody dresses up.
- I don't give a fuck.

23:13.087 --> 23:16.327
- Well, I just, I just
don't want you to be

23:16.351 --> 23:18.764
the only person in the
party without a costume.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.200
- Then I won't go.

23:20.224 --> 23:21.767
- Claire, would you just
relax for a second?

23:21.791 --> 23:23.334
Like, what's... - Just...

23:23.358 --> 23:24.901
- What's wrong with you today?
- Just forget it.

23:24.925 --> 23:26.511
- Okay.

23:26.535 --> 23:30.080
- I'm just a bit overwhelmed
with school and

23:30.104 --> 23:32.909
this might be my last quarter.

23:32.933 --> 23:34.954
- What do you mean?

23:34.978 --> 23:36.129
- I don't know.

23:36.153 --> 23:37.392
- Claire, you can't
just drop out

23:37.416 --> 23:38.828
halfway through
your junior year.

23:38.852 --> 23:40.699
- I don't know yet!

23:40.723 --> 23:44.834
I just have a lot on my mind
and Halloween isn't helping.

23:44.858 --> 23:45.858
- Babe.

23:46.555 --> 23:48.992
Look, I'm here for you, babe.

23:51.255 --> 23:52.842
- I know.
- You know?

23:52.866 --> 23:57.044
Whenever you're ready to talk
about it, I'm here for you.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.834
I gotta go to Coach's office.

24:06.183 --> 24:07.183
I love you.

24:25.464 --> 24:28.051
- And which one of Freud's
psychoanalytic theories

24:28.075 --> 24:32.253
of personalities is most
closely associated to birth?

24:33.254 --> 24:34.623
- The ego?

24:34.647 --> 24:35.648
- Not quite.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.173
Anyone?

24:44.395 --> 24:45.395
Claire?

24:46.963 --> 24:49.768
Do you care to wager
your thoughts?

24:49.792 --> 24:50.900
- The id.

24:50.924 --> 24:53.293
- And why is that?

24:53.317 --> 24:55.470
- Freud classified
this part of the brain

24:55.494 --> 24:57.733
driven by pleasure, a need.

24:57.757 --> 25:02.259
The id is a part of us that
just wants what it wants.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.576
♪ Every fear

25:14.600 --> 25:18.318
♪ Every thought, every desire

25:18.342 --> 25:22.129
♪ Near to my heart is a fire

25:23.913 --> 25:27.066
♪ Flames on my tongue

25:27.090 --> 25:30.113
♪ I spoke clearly

25:30.137 --> 25:32.637
♪ But was smoke in my lungs

25:32.661 --> 25:35.771
♪ Can you hear me

25:35.795 --> 25:37.903
♪ I want you to take me home

25:37.927 --> 25:40.689
♪ Where that is, I don't know

25:40.713 --> 25:43.518
♪ Holdin' onto hope

25:43.542 --> 25:46.109
♪ I want to go

26:00.254 --> 26:01.254
- What's up?

26:02.038 --> 26:04.190
- What's up, man?

26:04.214 --> 26:07.759
- You gettin' it in?
- Yeah.

26:07.783 --> 26:10.545
Where are you comin' from?
- Hern's office.

26:10.569 --> 26:11.633
- What's wrong?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.373
- Oh, nothin'.

26:13.397 --> 26:14.766
- You sure?
- Yeah.

26:14.790 --> 26:17.203
- You don't look sure.

26:17.227 --> 26:20.772
- It's just, been a little
stressed lately, you know?

26:20.796 --> 26:22.644
Classes and stuff like that.

26:22.668 --> 26:23.886
- How's Claire?

26:25.105 --> 26:25.908
- Claire?

26:25.932 --> 26:27.518
- Yeah.

26:27.542 --> 26:28.542
Claire.

26:30.023 --> 26:32.436
- She's alright.
- Alright.

26:32.460 --> 26:35.004
- Yeah, she's cool,
man, it's just...

26:35.028 --> 26:37.006
- I wish you would just
look at shit objectively.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.529
- I do.
- You do?

26:38.553 --> 26:39.574
- Yeah.

26:39.598 --> 26:41.619
- You're a good-looking dude.

26:41.643 --> 26:42.707
You got everything
going for you.

26:42.731 --> 26:44.883
You could be anything you want.

26:44.907 --> 26:47.146
I don't think she's
right for you, man.

26:47.170 --> 26:48.974
- It's not that,
it's just she's...

26:48.998 --> 26:51.281
- Not returning
your phone calls?

26:51.305 --> 26:53.892
Dude, you need, you've got
to get that girl a charger.

26:53.916 --> 26:56.460
Get her one in your car.

26:56.484 --> 26:58.244
Get her one in your room.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.594
A mothy, something.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.247
Jesus Christ.

27:01.271 --> 27:04.555
In the meantime, I need you to
get your head outta your ass,

27:04.579 --> 27:06.339
put up 30 on Saturday.

27:06.363 --> 27:07.906
It's the least you could do.

27:07.930 --> 27:08.907
I'm puttin' up 32.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.106
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.024
- 32 rebounds?

27:22.075 --> 27:23.182
- We did it!

27:23.206 --> 27:24.206
Woo!

27:26.688 --> 27:28.081
- Thanks, Claire.

27:38.569 --> 27:39.721
How was your day?

27:39.745 --> 27:40.920
- Good.

28:12.821 --> 28:13.755
- Boom.

28:13.779 --> 28:15.215
Check back again.

28:17.217 --> 28:19.567
You're supposed to check it.

28:43.243 --> 28:44.829
Come on, check it
up, check it up.

28:44.853 --> 28:45.853
Oh, what?

28:53.514 --> 28:54.514
What?

28:58.084 --> 28:59.607
You got out early.

29:00.434 --> 29:02.368
- You're sweaty.

29:02.392 --> 29:04.046
- Just a little bit.

29:05.047 --> 29:06.745
- Oh, you're so wet!

29:07.876 --> 29:10.574
- What're you gonna do about it?

29:12.576 --> 29:16.189
- Are we gonna go costume
shopping or what?

30:00.537 --> 30:02.626
- Let me take your pulse.

30:03.627 --> 30:04.996
Hmm.

30:05.020 --> 30:06.021
120 over 80.

30:07.718 --> 30:08.913
You're gonna be fine.

30:08.937 --> 30:11.548
Eat less red meat,
don't do drugs.

30:14.638 --> 30:15.638
Sailor.

30:17.598 --> 30:18.880
- Yeah.

30:18.904 --> 30:21.123
- I like it.
- It's perfect.

30:32.743 --> 30:35.810
- You look great, babe.

30:35.834 --> 30:36.835
- Thank you.

30:44.146 --> 30:45.800
- You are too much.

30:49.543 --> 30:50.607
M'lady.

30:50.631 --> 30:52.285
- Thank you.
- Mm-hm.

30:54.504 --> 30:56.004
You're comin' out
on Friday, right?

30:56.028 --> 30:57.527
- I'll be there.

30:57.551 --> 30:59.137
- Good, the party's gonna
be so out of control.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.574
We're having a costume contest
for the best dressed.

31:01.598 --> 31:02.837
I totally think you could win.

31:02.861 --> 31:05.907
And then we can get
drunk and hit DP.

31:07.822 --> 31:11.149
- I can't believe that.

31:11.173 --> 31:13.195
Oh my gosh, is
that your costume?

31:13.219 --> 31:15.501
- That is so cute.
- Super cute.

31:15.525 --> 31:17.939
- Oh my god, that's gonna be the
most adorable thing on you.

31:17.963 --> 31:18.983
- Yeah, I just got it.

31:19.007 --> 31:21.638
You guys remember Jason?

31:21.662 --> 31:23.248
- Obviously, hello.

31:23.272 --> 31:25.642
You've only been dating him
for like a year or something.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.122
- Seriously, I don't
know how you do it.

31:27.146 --> 31:28.471
- Transcendental meditation.

31:30.584 --> 31:32.649
- So how's the basketball
comin' along, Jason?

31:32.673 --> 31:35.608
- It's good, the first game of
our season is Saturday night.

31:35.632 --> 31:37.915
- Really?
- Yeah, night after Halloween.

31:37.939 --> 31:39.134
- That's inconvenient.

31:39.158 --> 31:40.222
- Seriously.

31:40.246 --> 31:41.745
Fuck.

31:41.769 --> 31:43.355
- Like, your coach should
be fired, that's fucked.

31:43.379 --> 31:44.748
- That's totally fucked, you
guys could like die or some...

31:44.772 --> 31:46.968

that bad, it'll be fun.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.317
Y'all should come through.
- I'm down.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.274
I wanna see a game.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.189
- Nobody's gonna die, I promise.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.410
I gotta get goin'.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.871
I love you. - I love you, too.

31:58.612 --> 32:00.068
- It's nice seein' you girls.

32:00.092 --> 32:01.983
Our house is havin' a really
big party this Friday

32:02.007 --> 32:04.333
for Halloween, you all
should swing through.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.248
- Sounds fun.
- Okay.

32:06.272 --> 32:07.858
- Yeah.

cute together.

32:18.284 --> 32:21.002
- Oh my god, he's so tall.
- Like Barbie and Ken.

32:21.026 --> 32:23.134
I can't.
- Is that really his car?

32:23.158 --> 32:24.831
- Where are you
guys heading now?

32:24.855 --> 32:26.137
- We're goin' to Luke Glendon's.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.704
He's having like a
small get-together.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.662
- Yeah, have you met him?
- No.

32:29.686 --> 32:32.361
- It's just right across the
street from the Marley house.

32:32.385 --> 32:34.406
It's gonna be, you
know, whatever.

32:34.430 --> 32:35.930
- Yeah, we shouldn't
be gone too long.

32:35.954 --> 32:38.062
- Yeah, I have to be in
bed and asleep by two AM.

32:38.086 --> 32:40.499
- No, seriously, I need sleep.
- Yeah.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.893
- Well, I hope you guys
have fun, be safe.

32:42.917 --> 32:43.807
- Love you.

32:43.831 --> 32:44.832

32:49.097 --> 32:50.751
No, you don't call.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.645
- I don't know, what about you?

32:55.669 --> 32:56.733
- My stupid money.

32:56.757 --> 32:57.995
Hi!

What'd you get?

32:59.412 --> 33:00.737
- Sailor girl outfit.

33:00.761 --> 33:04.741

33:08.682 --> 33:11.400
What's up?
- He's such a dick, as usual.

33:11.424 --> 33:13.184
- Like always?
- Yes.

33:13.208 --> 33:15.839
- I mean, just
break up with him.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.580
I don't know what the deal is.

33:17.604 --> 33:21.888
- I know, but first I
just, I need a shot.

33:21.912 --> 33:23.064
- Of course you do.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.240
What about you guys,
up for a shot?

33:25.264 --> 33:26.850
- Please.
- I want one.

33:26.874 --> 33:28.547
- So hungover.

33:28.571 --> 33:30.051
- Hair of the dog.

33:32.314 --> 33:33.314
- Oh, yeah.

33:36.579 --> 33:38.079
What the fuck was that?

33:38.103 --> 33:39.341
- Is someone here?

33:39.365 --> 33:42.039
- Nobody's here, it's just us.

33:42.063 --> 33:45.719
- It's probably just Tiff.
- Tiff's in class.

33:51.159 --> 33:53.161
It's always a good idea.

34:07.741 --> 34:08.741
- Tiff?

34:17.315 --> 34:18.315
Tiff.

34:34.855 --> 34:36.614
- That is why I keep
getting hungover.

34:36.639 --> 34:38.859
- That's the best!

35:07.540 --> 35:09.387
Oh my...

35:09.411 --> 35:10.910
What the?

37:02.307 --> 37:03.501
- Yeah?

37:03.525 --> 37:04.807
- I have a friend
who's having a party.

37:04.831 --> 37:06.156
- Oh, really?

37:06.180 --> 37:08.463
Oh, that's cool.
- Yeah, it's gonna be on DP.

37:08.487 --> 37:11.117
Everybody's gonna be there, so.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.424
Yeah and he like said his
roommate's not there,

37:13.448 --> 37:15.774
so he has like an extra room.

37:15.798 --> 37:16.886
- Oh, really?

37:19.019 --> 37:21.519
- I'm not on the pill.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.652
And you know where the tide is.

37:23.676 --> 37:27.395
- Are you fucking serious?
- Completely.

37:27.419 --> 37:29.745
- Fuck!
- It's okay.

37:29.769 --> 37:31.442
I'll go down on you.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.314
- But what about you?
- What about me?

37:33.338 --> 37:35.925
- What do you want
me to do to you?

37:35.949 --> 37:38.101
- Come swimming with me.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.885
- Are you fucking serious?

37:39.909 --> 37:40.997
- Completely.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.305
Are you coming or what?

37:53.967 --> 37:56.293
- These guys are fucking nuts.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.339
- Nuts.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.384
Wow, well hey, at least
if they get too drunk

38:00.408 --> 38:02.560
and need assistance, you can
help them, Mr. Lifeguard.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.780
- Oh, yeah, looks like you
might need some assisting.

38:04.804 --> 38:07.173
- You're stupid.

38:09.112 --> 38:12.551
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

38:42.798 --> 38:46.149
- Felt good, right?
- Oh my god, amazing.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.115
- Oh my god, look at the stars.

38:56.421 --> 38:58.292
- I'm lookin' at them.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.296
- No, no, really,
really look at 'em.

39:03.863 --> 39:04.864
- It's nice.

39:22.882 --> 39:24.163
- I gotta pee.

39:24.187 --> 39:25.556
- You're kidding.

39:25.580 --> 39:29.192
- No, I'm dead serious,
I'll be right back.

40:11.496 --> 40:12.496
- Yo, Jen!

40:16.239 --> 40:17.239
Jen!

40:21.114 --> 40:22.114
Jen!

40:32.430 --> 40:33.430
Jen!

40:36.172 --> 40:37.172
Jen!

40:44.790 --> 40:45.790
Jen!

40:47.488 --> 40:48.488
Jen!

40:50.535 --> 40:51.535
Jen!

40:53.407 --> 40:54.407
Jen!

41:03.069 --> 41:04.438
What the fuck?

41:04.462 --> 41:05.462
Oh, fuck!

41:11.164 --> 41:12.707
Get off me!

42:28.546 --> 42:30.330
- Wait, where is Jen?

42:31.810 --> 42:33.178
- They're swimming.

42:33.202 --> 42:35.857
- Yeah but that was a while ago.

42:37.163 --> 42:39.818
Shouldn't we be worried?
- Mm-mm.

42:41.341 --> 42:43.188
- Okay, what about sharks
or like a tidal wave?

42:43.212 --> 42:46.496
Or, I don't know,
you're the lifeguard.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.411
- They're probably just.

42:48.435 --> 42:50.021
- What is that?

42:50.045 --> 42:53.179
- Hanging out further
down the beach.

42:54.572 --> 42:55.810

could've gotten some sticks

42:55.834 --> 42:57.507
and made a fire.

42:57.531 --> 42:58.531
- Exactly.

43:04.756 --> 43:06.584
- Who's that?

43:16.028 --> 43:17.396
- What's up?

43:17.420 --> 43:19.311
- Who the fuck is that?

43:19.335 --> 43:21.903
- Fuckin' help you?

43:23.992 --> 43:25.317
- Oh my god!

43:26.865 --> 43:29.974
Stop!

43:32.522 --> 43:33.522
Oh my god.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.428
Luke, get up!

43:53.587 --> 43:54.587

43:55.545 --> 43:56.545

43:59.985 --> 44:00.985
Help!

44:04.990 --> 44:06.837
What are you doing?

44:06.861 --> 44:08.297
Get away from me.

44:09.777 --> 44:10.777
Get away!

44:59.087 --> 45:00.761
- So, 40?

45:00.785 --> 45:02.066
- 50.

45:02.090 --> 45:03.502
- 50?
- Correct.

45:03.526 --> 45:07.768
- Don't I get some kind
of special discount?

45:07.792 --> 45:10.403
What's wrong with you, anyways?

45:11.360 --> 45:13.817
Hello? - Are we done here?

45:13.841 --> 45:15.843
- Are you being serious?

45:25.331 --> 45:26.482
Here.

45:26.506 --> 45:28.856
Wait, Ryan. - Oh, please stop.

45:30.249 --> 45:32.140
- This is hard.
- How so?

45:32.164 --> 45:33.844
- I'm miss hanging out
with you on Fridays.

45:34.688 --> 45:35.688
I do.

45:36.734 --> 45:38.407
Come on, we used to
spend the whole day

45:38.431 --> 45:41.802
laying in bed watching Netflix.

45:41.826 --> 45:43.044
It was perfect.

45:44.698 --> 45:46.526
And then, you changed.

45:47.875 --> 45:50.158
I mean, what happened to that,
Ryan, what happened to us?

45:50.182 --> 45:52.203
- Uh, we broke up?
- So what.

45:52.227 --> 45:53.161
- What do you mean "so what?"

45:53.185 --> 45:53.988
- So we can't hang out anymore?

45:54.012 --> 45:55.467
- No.
- Why?

45:55.491 --> 45:57.339
- That's not how it works.
- Why not?

45:57.363 --> 46:01.517
- This is not healthy, we
really need to stop doin' this.

46:01.541 --> 46:02.823
- You're wrong.

46:02.847 --> 46:04.389
- How so?
- You just are.

46:04.413 --> 46:05.956
- Listen, I'm
seeing someone now.

46:05.980 --> 46:09.027
What about that don't
you understand?

46:10.985 --> 46:14.138
- You're seeing someone else?
- That's what I fucking said.

46:14.162 --> 46:15.162
- Claire?

46:21.300 --> 46:24.409
And how is that going
for you, by the way?

46:24.433 --> 46:26.107
Are you gonna come
with us on Saturday

46:26.131 --> 46:28.718
to watch her boyfriend
score some baskets?

46:30.962 --> 46:32.572
- Go fuck yourself.

46:34.574 --> 46:35.899
Here's your fucking discount.

46:35.923 --> 46:39.250
Don't ever fucking
call me again.

46:52.897 --> 46:54.918
- You look beautiful
for the dance.

46:54.942 --> 46:56.137
- Thank you.

46:56.161 --> 46:58.574
- Is this like forever?

46:58.598 --> 47:00.121
- Matthew!

47:02.297 --> 47:03.297
- I'm good.

47:06.998 --> 47:08.584
- Call for help!

47:15.963 --> 47:17.312
Close your eyes.

47:19.706 --> 47:21.031
Open.

47:21.055 --> 47:22.055
- Oh!

47:24.667 --> 47:26.515
- What's that?
- Panda.

47:26.539 --> 47:28.846
- Okay, what about this one?

47:30.935 --> 47:32.980
It's okay, we'll move on.

47:34.634 --> 47:36.786
What about this? - Grey wolf.

47:36.810 --> 47:38.464

Jimmy.

47:50.563 --> 47:52.889
Jimmy, what's wrong?

47:52.913 --> 47:54.935
- I want to be that.

47:54.959 --> 47:56.177
- Oh, sweetie.

47:59.964 --> 48:01.202
It's okay.

48:04.490 --> 48:05.597
- Claire.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.034
Claire, are you awake?

48:07.058 --> 48:09.321
- And how did you find out?

48:10.496 --> 48:11.497
- Instagram.

48:12.977 --> 48:15.259
She found me and messaged me.

48:15.283 --> 48:17.131
- Why?
- What do you mean "why?"

48:17.155 --> 48:19.481
She was fucking Steve, too.

48:19.505 --> 48:21.657
And apparently for a while.

48:21.681 --> 48:23.659
And when she found
he had a girlfriend,

48:23.683 --> 48:25.226
she was really pissed off.

48:25.250 --> 48:29.341
I just don't get it, all this
time he seemed so genuine.

48:30.995 --> 48:33.084
And my parents loved him.

48:35.173 --> 48:36.870
Three fucking years?

48:38.263 --> 48:41.764
Three, Claire, and we like
talked about marriage a lot.

48:41.788 --> 48:43.635
How do you talk about spending
your whole fucking life

48:43.659 --> 48:47.074
with somebody and then fucking
someone else on the side?

48:47.098 --> 48:50.729
It doesn't make the
slightest bit of sense.

48:50.753 --> 48:53.863
How can I have been so stupid?

48:53.887 --> 48:55.193
- What can I do?

48:56.107 --> 48:57.369
- Come with me.

49:06.117 --> 49:07.877
I can't do this.

49:07.901 --> 49:08.901
- You can.

49:10.034 --> 49:12.427
You can do anything you want.

49:15.735 --> 49:16.736
You're free.

out with me tonight?

50:14.533 --> 50:15.989
- Where?

50:16.013 --> 50:18.165
- To Jason's, he's
having a huge party.

50:18.189 --> 50:20.210
- I don't even think I
feel like going out now.

50:20.234 --> 50:21.907

out and then went to class.

50:59.056 --> 51:01.295
- Yeah, but they usually
come home and shower first.

51:01.319 --> 51:03.471
Oh well, I thought I'd
just check with you.

51:03.495 --> 51:05.429

01:01:41.959 --> 01:01:42.849
- This!

01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:44.198
This whole situation.

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:46.093
- There's no situation.

01:01:48.356 --> 01:01:50.726
- Yeah, it looks like it.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:53.163
- What's that supposed to mean?

01:01:53.187 --> 01:01:53.990
- Nothing.

01:01:54.014 --> 01:01:55.014
- Nothing?

01:01:55.799 --> 01:01:57.951
- It's just, look at you.

01:01:57.975 --> 01:02:00.170
Your hair's a mess,
your makeup's running.

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:02.695
You look like you've
been crying all day.

01:02:02.719 --> 01:02:06.350
And then you come over and you
just wanna do blow and fuck?

01:02:06.374 --> 01:02:08.831
Like this is normal to you?

01:02:08.855 --> 01:02:09.855
- Normal?

01:02:10.944 --> 01:02:12.269
- You're a mess.

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:13.923
- I had a long day.

01:02:13.947 --> 01:02:16.143
I wanted to come
over here and relax

01:02:16.167 --> 01:02:17.797
and not worry for once, okay?

01:02:17.821 --> 01:02:18.928
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:18.952 --> 01:02:20.190
- Yeah.

01:02:20.214 --> 01:02:23.716
- Does your boyfriend
know where you are?

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.717
- I guess I'm gonna leave that.

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:25.674
- Claire.
- No.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:26.588
- Just sit down for one second.

01:02:26.612 --> 01:02:27.807
- No, it's fine.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.025
- Sit down for one
fucking second.

01:02:29.049 --> 01:02:30.026
- Let go, let go!
- Claire, sit down!

01:02:30.050 --> 01:02:30.810
- Let go of me, stop it!
- Jesus!

01:02:30.834 --> 01:02:31.985
Fine, there!

01:02:32.009 --> 01:02:33.009
I'm sorry!

01:02:36.535 --> 01:02:40.167
Do you know how long
I've liked you?

01:02:40.191 --> 01:02:43.518
Since Freshman year,
back in San Raf.

01:02:43.542 --> 01:02:45.346
Street 1201, do you
remember that?

01:02:45.370 --> 01:02:47.740
- Don't pretend that
you care about me.

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.350
- Excuse me?

01:02:49.374 --> 01:02:51.221
- Don't pretend, you
got what you wanted.

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:52.962
- I'm telling you.

01:02:52.986 --> 01:02:56.357
- You and I both are the
same type of person.

01:02:56.381 --> 01:02:57.469
- How's that?

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:05.845
- Just want what we want, we
don't care about the cost.

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:07.455
- You're wrong, Claire.

01:03:07.479 --> 01:03:08.630
So wrong. - How?

01:03:08.654 --> 01:03:09.698
- I like you.

01:03:12.353 --> 01:03:16.227
Claire, you're, you're
smart, you're beautiful.

01:03:18.185 --> 01:03:22.078
We have more fun stayin' in
and eatin' Chinese food, and,

01:03:22.102 --> 01:03:24.689
I wanna be with you, Claire.

01:03:24.713 --> 01:03:26.803
Why won't you be with me?

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:37.006
- Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

01:03:37.030 --> 01:03:38.181
- What?

01:03:38.205 --> 01:03:39.205
That's it?

01:03:41.643 --> 01:03:42.925
No.

01:03:42.949 --> 01:03:44.274
- I should go.
- Claire, just wait a minute.

01:03:44.298 --> 01:03:47.582
Let's just talk,
we're not done here.

01:03:47.606 --> 01:03:49.173
Please don't leave.

01:03:52.176 --> 01:03:53.176
Claire?

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:09.751
- Wow!

01:05:09.775 --> 01:05:11.168
- Smells so good.

01:05:12.473 --> 01:05:13.711
Will you make me one?

01:05:13.735 --> 01:05:15.757
Just kidding, have you
seen me in this costume?

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:17.106
I look like a whale.

01:05:17.130 --> 01:05:19.500
- Oh my god, stop.
- Oh my god, no you don't.

01:05:19.524 --> 01:05:21.632
- Fucking freebirds.

01:05:21.656 --> 01:05:23.025
- You guys, I don't think
I'm gonna go tonight.

01:05:23.049 --> 01:05:25.985
I don't care about
how much we drink.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:27.812
- Oh my god, do you
know where it's at?

01:05:27.836 --> 01:05:28.988
- Of course.

01:05:29.012 --> 01:05:30.448
You look amazing!

01:05:31.579 --> 01:05:33.775
- That looks so cute.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.559
- Okay, we're gonna walk over?

01:05:35.583 --> 01:05:36.952
- We have to pick
up Tom and Chris

01:05:36.976 --> 01:05:38.258
but we'll meet you
guys over there.

01:05:38.282 --> 01:05:39.128
- Okay.

01:05:39.152 --> 01:05:40.588
- Have fun!
- Bye!

01:05:41.850 --> 01:05:43.698
- See ya later.

Help!

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.014
- Why do you think we're here?

01:13:32.582 --> 01:13:33.931
- In Isla Vista?

01:13:35.323 --> 01:13:36.323
- No, here.

01:13:38.457 --> 01:13:40.740
- What do you mean?

01:13:40.764 --> 01:13:43.114
- Like, what is our purpose?

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:46.334
- Like, in life?

01:13:53.124 --> 01:13:57.060
Well, I was raised Christian,
so I was taught that.

01:13:57.084 --> 01:13:58.912
God has a plan for us.

01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:02.438
- What kind of plan?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.963
- You know, like, for our life.

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:11.814
He knows our ways, he
knows our desires.

01:14:11.838 --> 01:14:13.579
He has a plan for us.

01:14:16.582 --> 01:14:19.106
- Do you go to church anymore?

01:14:20.978 --> 01:14:24.348
- Not so much.

01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:26.960
I only go sometimes, like,

01:14:26.984 --> 01:14:29.334
at holidays, when I go home.

01:14:34.121 --> 01:14:36.926
- I don't think that's true.

01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:38.125
- What's true?

01:14:39.997 --> 01:14:41.583
- I don't feel like my life

01:14:41.607 --> 01:14:44.480
is being guided by
a higher force.

01:14:46.873 --> 01:14:48.832
- How do you know that?

01:14:50.181 --> 01:14:52.836
- Because, when I let myself go,

01:14:54.315 --> 01:14:55.969
like, completely go,

01:14:58.885 --> 01:15:00.147
I feel nothing.

01:15:08.591 --> 01:15:11.395
- That doesn't mean that
he isn't still there,

01:15:11.419 --> 01:15:13.683
or something greater isn't.

01:15:15.380 --> 01:15:17.034
Buddha or the stars.

01:15:18.688 --> 01:15:20.690
Whatever you believe in.

01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:26.957
You know, we have to
believe in somethin'.

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:33.311
Otherwise, what's the point?

01:15:42.015 --> 01:15:45.584
- Do you feel him when
you play basketball?

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:48.041
- Basketball?

01:15:48.065 --> 01:15:50.086
- Yeah.
- What do you mean?

01:15:50.110 --> 01:15:53.394
- Like, do you feel
him tilting the game

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:57.093
one way or another, is
he there when you play?

01:15:57.117 --> 01:15:58.205
- Absolutely.

01:16:00.512 --> 01:16:01.512
Win or lose.

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:17.267
- Jason.

01:16:23.622 --> 01:16:25.537
I'm afraid to lose you.

01:16:28.758 --> 01:16:31.151
- What are you talkin' about?

01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:37.941
- You're all I have left.

01:16:40.813 --> 01:16:45.098
I think I may be in
love with you, but it,

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:46.166
terrifies me.

01:16:47.037 --> 01:16:48.865
I wanna believe in us.

01:16:51.955 --> 01:16:55.045
- Claire, what are
you talkin' about?

01:16:57.308 --> 01:16:58.788
I know I love you.

01:17:00.964 --> 01:17:03.009
I'm not gonna leave you.

01:17:06.796 --> 01:17:08.972
- But what if you have to?

01:17:10.887 --> 01:17:11.887
- I can't.

01:17:12.628 --> 01:17:13.629
And I won't.

01:17:16.544 --> 01:17:17.544
I promise.

01:17:47.488 --> 01:17:49.510
- Thank you for walking me home.

01:17:49.534 --> 01:17:50.535
- Of course.

01:17:58.761 --> 01:18:00.303
- Are you excited?

01:18:00.327 --> 01:18:01.261
- For what?

01:18:01.285 --> 01:18:03.002
- Tomorrow's big game.

01:18:03.026 --> 01:18:04.743
- Of course.

01:18:04.767 --> 01:18:05.767
- Me too.

01:18:07.552 --> 01:18:08.553
I'm nervous.

01:18:09.554 --> 01:18:10.554
- Why?

01:18:11.991 --> 01:18:13.253
- I don't know.

01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:15.298
- I'm not.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:21.281
I know it's out of my hands.

01:18:21.305 --> 01:18:23.133
- I love you.

01:18:24.612 --> 01:18:26.092
- I love you, too.

01:18:32.011 --> 01:18:33.032
Goodnight.

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:34.598
- Night.

01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:49.435
No!

01:19:50.133 --> 01:19:51.133
No.

01:21:13.303 --> 01:21:16.021
I need help immediately.

01:21:16.045 --> 01:21:18.134
My roommate was murdered.

01:21:20.440 --> 01:21:22.268
He could have done it.

01:21:23.704 --> 01:21:26.379
I said my roommate was
murdered, there's a maniac

01:21:26.403 --> 01:21:28.903
on the loose and he
is killing people.

01:21:28.927 --> 01:21:32.061
I don't know, I'm on
Del Playa Street.

01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:35.412
Um, 6545 Del Playa,

01:21:37.240 --> 01:21:41.220
and I live just, that was
the last place I saw him.

01:21:41.244 --> 01:21:43.875
I said he was at that house.

01:21:46.336 --> 01:21:47.598
6545 Del Playa.

01:21:50.862 --> 01:21:52.081
6545 Del Playa.

01:21:53.169 --> 01:21:54.518
Can you hear me?

01:21:55.432 --> 01:21:56.757
Fuck.

01:22:26.463 --> 01:22:27.919
Oh, fuck.

01:22:27.943 --> 01:22:30.486
Fuck.

01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:37.640
- Hey.

01:23:37.664 --> 01:23:39.164
- Ryan, where are you?

01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:41.427
- I'm just takin' a walk.

01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:43.037
- Look, I don't have
time to explain,

01:23:43.061 --> 01:23:44.343
but somebody is
trying to kill me.

01:23:44.367 --> 01:23:45.866
- Wait, what?

01:23:45.890 --> 01:23:47.520
- Somebody's trying to kill
me, he's killing people!

01:23:47.544 --> 01:23:50.697
- Who's, who's killing who?

01:23:50.721 --> 01:23:53.700
- This psycho I used to know,
his name is Matthew Hudson.

01:23:53.724 --> 01:23:55.049
- Did you call the police?

01:23:55.073 --> 01:23:56.616
- Yes, I called them,
they're on their way

01:23:56.640 --> 01:23:59.314
but he's right behind me.
- Okay, slow down, slow down.

01:23:59.338 --> 01:24:01.534
Where are you?
- Six, seven hundred.

01:24:01.558 --> 01:24:02.733
6700 Block DP.

01:24:03.908 --> 01:24:04.885
- Okay, you're gonna
have to be a little bit

01:24:04.909 --> 01:24:06.060
more specific than that.

01:24:06.084 --> 01:24:08.715
- 6779 DP, that's where I'll be.

01:24:08.739 --> 01:24:09.977
I'll wait for you there.

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:10.934
Please hurry. - Okay.

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:12.569
I'm coming, Claire.

01:26:06.987 --> 01:26:07.987
- Matthew.

01:26:10.687 --> 01:26:12.341
I'm never giving up.

01:26:46.636 --> 01:26:47.898
- Are you cold?

01:26:49.378 --> 01:26:51.467
Claire, you're shivering.

01:26:54.557 --> 01:26:55.645
There you go.

01:27:00.258 --> 01:27:01.390
Is that better?

01:27:15.404 --> 01:27:16.903
You have a strong back.

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:28.393
I used to love to watch
you cheer back at Tapt.

01:27:28.417 --> 01:27:30.245
You were sensational.

01:27:35.859 --> 01:27:39.534
The way your spirit
moved the crowd.

01:27:39.558 --> 01:27:42.450
Your eyes lit up the stands.

01:27:42.474 --> 01:27:46.478
I used to watch you and
think, if only she knew.

01:27:48.437 --> 01:27:49.699
If only, right?

01:27:55.139 --> 01:27:58.379
Like how I Used to spend
my time in the library,

01:27:58.403 --> 01:28:02.296
I'd take my lunch in there
and I'd read books.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.734
But the story was
always the same.

01:28:05.758 --> 01:28:07.325
It was you, Claire.

01:28:08.761 --> 01:28:12.654
Every page I read, every
story was the same, it was,

01:28:12.678 --> 01:28:14.506
it was you, I saw you.

01:28:15.638 --> 01:28:16.987
I saw your face.

01:28:19.119 --> 01:28:20.119
I saw us,

01:28:22.122 --> 01:28:24.951
happy together,
deep away in love.

01:28:28.259 --> 01:28:30.305
Eventually I believed it.

01:28:33.351 --> 01:28:34.633
Under any other circumstance,

01:28:34.657 --> 01:28:38.071
we could have been inseparable.

01:28:38.095 --> 01:28:39.662
The perfect couple.

01:28:40.837 --> 01:28:44.319
The pride of the entire
San Fernando valley.

01:28:46.451 --> 01:28:47.539
God's couple.

01:28:49.106 --> 01:28:52.433
Have you taken the time
to look at me now?

01:28:52.457 --> 01:28:54.807
Like, really look at me now?

01:28:56.156 --> 01:28:58.439
I'm fucking gorgeous.

01:28:58.463 --> 01:28:59.812
I'm magnificent.

01:29:01.118 --> 01:29:04.184
I lift weights with
disciplined regularity.

01:29:04.208 --> 01:29:06.123
I am tall and vascular.

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:11.496
I've put a lot of work into
my appearance, Claire.

01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:17.676
And then there was Tim.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:19.895
Of all people, Tim?

01:29:19.919 --> 01:29:21.506
Timmy?

01:29:21.530 --> 01:29:22.768
Tim fucking Murphy?

01:29:22.792 --> 01:29:23.792
Please.

01:29:24.620 --> 01:29:26.709
What made him so special?

01:29:30.452 --> 01:29:31.452
No, really.

01:29:32.932 --> 01:29:35.021
What made him so special?

01:29:37.633 --> 01:29:38.871
Claire!

01:29:38.895 --> 01:29:42.899
Are you listening?

01:29:52.822 --> 01:29:56.391
After the night of the
dance, I blamed you.

01:29:57.566 --> 01:29:59.698
I resented you for years.

01:30:01.483 --> 01:30:04.070
This could have
all been avoided,

01:30:04.094 --> 01:30:08.422
if you hadn't been so
unbelievably ignorant,

01:30:08.446 --> 01:30:11.033
and just chosen to love me.

01:30:11.057 --> 01:30:15.690
But then I realized this
really wasn't your fault.

01:30:15.714 --> 01:30:17.910
This was the world's fault.

01:30:17.934 --> 01:30:20.545
You were simply the mouthpiece.

01:30:21.677 --> 01:30:23.089
Why?

01:30:23.113 --> 01:30:25.961
Well, because life
isn't fucking fair,

01:30:25.985 --> 01:30:29.791
and I did everything in
my power to change that,

01:30:29.815 --> 01:30:31.924
to better myself,

01:30:31.948 --> 01:30:33.950
to make you see, Claire.

01:30:35.517 --> 01:30:37.606
I wanted to make you pay.

01:30:38.868 --> 01:30:41.890
And now I want the world to pay.

01:30:48.921 --> 01:30:51.944
This ends tonight,
Claire Rhodes.

01:30:51.968 --> 01:30:52.969
On my terms.

01:30:55.711 --> 01:30:58.298
The perfect ending to
a beautiful mistake.

01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:02.760
Whoa.

01:31:04.589 --> 01:31:05.634
Are you okay?

01:31:07.026 --> 01:31:08.026
Claire.

01:31:10.160 --> 01:31:11.160
Claire?

01:31:12.815 --> 01:31:14.164
Are you alright?

01:31:17.646 --> 01:31:20.823
- You can't force
someone to love you.

01:31:24.522 --> 01:31:27.482
You think because
you find yourself,

01:31:28.787 --> 01:31:31.766
attractive,

01:31:31.790 --> 01:31:33.836
you're entitled to women?

01:31:39.581 --> 01:31:43.759
You're pathetic and a coward
and I hope your life was

01:31:44.977 --> 01:31:48.590
as much of hell as the
one you're burning in.

01:31:54.900 --> 01:31:56.728
- But I'm not burning.

01:32:01.646 --> 01:32:03.972
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:32:08.610 --> 01:32:10.742
- You're burning, alright.

01:32:58.268 --> 01:32:59.835
- If only you knew.

01:33:03.708 --> 01:33:05.057
- Hey, you fuck!

01:33:57.283 --> 01:33:58.807
- Dude.

01:34:07.467 --> 01:34:10.621
- They're asking people with
information to come forward.

01:34:22.569 --> 01:34:24.069
- I know, it's strange.

01:34:24.093 --> 01:34:25.287
- But where is the body?

01:34:25.311 --> 01:34:27.289
They're all in the hospital.

01:34:27.313 --> 01:34:29.727
- A deadly rampage has
claimed the lives of several

01:34:29.751 --> 01:34:32.730
college students, at least
six are confirmed dead

01:34:32.754 --> 01:34:35.036
and another student
fighting for his life.

01:34:35.060 --> 01:34:37.865
Police say this killer wore a
mask and he aimed his attack

01:34:37.889 --> 01:34:40.999
right here at the Kappa
Alpha Theta sorority house.

01:34:41.023 --> 01:34:43.958
As far as a motive for all
this, that is still not known.

01:34:43.982 --> 01:34:45.830
Authorities believe
the killer is dead,

01:34:45.854 --> 01:34:48.746
but his body has not been found.

01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:51.052
One thing's for sure, Santa
Barbara Police keeping

01:34:51.076 --> 01:34:53.968
incredibly quiet about all
this, they're asking students

01:34:53.992 --> 01:34:57.711
to report any suspicious
activity to police.

01:35:10.139 --> 01:35:13.031
- Kids say he had PTSD,

01:35:13.055 --> 01:35:16.599
that he was beaten
into submission,

01:35:16.623 --> 01:35:18.843
his brain rewired, mutated.

01:35:21.541 --> 01:35:24.999
They found a carving knife
through his step-dad's skull

01:35:25.023 --> 01:35:26.938
a few Halloweens later.

01:35:29.636 --> 01:35:32.422
That was after he
had disappeared.

01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.034
I disagree, it's not nurture,

01:35:37.601 --> 01:35:41.474
it's not some genetic predisposition
in our brains, either.

01:35:42.693 --> 01:35:44.627
We're animals.

01:35:44.651 --> 01:35:48.544
We're born to kill,
to love, to hate,

01:35:48.568 --> 01:35:50.570
to survive at all costs.

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:58.293
Matthew Hudson didn't
take my innocence away

01:35:58.317 --> 01:36:00.885
the night he killed Tim Murphy,

01:36:01.930 --> 01:36:04.759
or through the events
in Isla Vista.

01:36:06.238 --> 01:36:07.370
His massacre.

01:36:09.154 --> 01:36:12.873
He opened my eyes to our
basis for existence

01:36:12.897 --> 01:36:14.333
inside all of us.

01:36:17.119 --> 01:36:19.924
I don't know where Matthew is,

01:36:19.948 --> 01:36:23.057
or pretend to know
what he wants,

01:36:23.081 --> 01:36:27.259
I just know that, like the
ocean's tide, he'll come again.

01:36:30.262 --> 01:36:33.154
There is an animal
inside of all of us.

01:36:33.178 --> 01:36:35.766
Not something predetermined.

01:36:35.790 --> 01:36:39.073
Not something moral,
not civilized.

01:36:39.097 --> 01:36:43.275
Not baptized, not neatly
categorized or diagnosed.

01:36:46.801 --> 01:36:49.281
It's a shadow that follows us.
