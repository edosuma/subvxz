WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:03.707
Previously on "Casual"...

00:08.679 --> 00:10.097
You're currently not working?

00:10.122 --> 00:13.223
I'm dabbling
in the hospitality business.

00:13.224 --> 00:14.421
If I put you on a budget,

00:14.422 --> 00:17.518
your savings can get you
through the end of the year.

00:17.543 --> 00:19.104
Okay, so this is the cereal aisle,

00:19.105 --> 00:20.355
and it's just like Postmates,

00:20.356 --> 00:21.983
except if you want a box,
you just grab one.

00:21.984 --> 00:23.343
Hush. I'm multitasking.

00:23.436 --> 00:25.302
Job search? Tell me!

00:25.382 --> 00:27.851
It's all dumb, just dressed up
entry-level stuff.

00:27.876 --> 00:29.364
Where are you getting this list?

00:29.365 --> 00:30.283
Head hunter.

00:30.284 --> 00:31.366
That sounds violent.

00:31.367 --> 00:32.450
That's what work is,

00:32.451 --> 00:34.770
sublimation of our violent
desires to hunt and fuck.

00:34.795 --> 00:36.150
Why would you lie to me
about the tattoo?

00:36.175 --> 00:37.284
'Cause I'm a teenager.

00:37.309 --> 00:40.406
If you want it removed,
you can earn the money yourself.

00:40.431 --> 00:41.479
Fine.

00:41.504 --> 00:42.941
Hello, hurried consumer.

00:42.966 --> 00:44.508
Care to sign the green power initiative

00:44.533 --> 00:46.753
and put alternative fuel
vehicles on the road?

00:46.778 --> 00:47.843
No. You do not.

00:47.844 --> 00:49.927
What does one do
in a storytelling class anyway?

00:49.928 --> 00:51.731
We mine the experiences of our lives

00:51.851 --> 00:54.851
to create a truthful
and engaging performance piece.

00:54.876 --> 00:57.100
- Sounds hokey.
- Quarterlife crisis.

00:57.101 --> 00:58.599
Mm! Midlife crisis.

00:58.624 --> 01:00.471
Well, she looks like she's
having a midlife crisis.

01:00.497 --> 01:03.104
But she's dressed like she's
having a quarterlife crisis.

01:03.224 --> 01:05.257
And her boots are new,
so that's part of it.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.944
How did you know I got 'em today?

01:06.945 --> 01:08.859
Check your sole.

01:15.578 --> 01:17.496
Oh, no.

01:17.904 --> 01:19.447
Absolutely not.

01:19.684 --> 01:21.094
- No.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:21.119 --> 01:22.595
- She was pretty.
- Robot.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.194
How many times a day

01:24.219 --> 01:26.274
do you think the average person
gets rejected?

01:26.352 --> 01:27.860
Guy or girl?

01:27.937 --> 01:29.020
Uh, guy.

01:29.175 --> 01:31.854
Single app or across all platforms?

01:31.971 --> 01:32.974
Let's say all.

01:33.056 --> 01:34.387
Thousands.

01:34.388 --> 01:35.674
Oh. Here he is.

01:35.849 --> 01:38.248
Hello.

01:40.284 --> 01:42.210
I like your necklace.

01:42.700 --> 01:44.325
It's a Celtic charm.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.691
Yeah, huh.

01:45.692 --> 01:47.400
Looks like two trees fucking.

01:48.611 --> 01:52.644
The tree of life's about the connection
between all God's creations:

01:52.986 --> 01:56.104
tree, animal, man, woman.

01:56.243 --> 01:59.313
Well, I like it a lot.

01:59.942 --> 02:01.442
What's your name?

02:01.583 --> 02:02.792
Valerie.

02:03.240 --> 02:05.962
Nice to meet you.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.672 --> 02:15.929
That was quick.

02:16.042 --> 02:16.990
Got an interview.

02:17.335 --> 02:19.469
Some new company in digital branding.

02:19.515 --> 02:21.060
- Sounds promising.
- Wow.

02:21.061 --> 02:23.640
Oh, yeah. Very promising.

02:26.024 --> 02:28.026
What's going on there?
You working something?

02:28.051 --> 02:30.003
No, just a little something.

02:30.073 --> 02:32.215
- Mm, did you tip him?
- Yep.

02:32.989 --> 02:35.275
Bad move. Now he thinks
you look down on him.

02:35.317 --> 02:37.543
No, you... you know, what do you know?

02:37.574 --> 02:38.699
A lot.

02:38.849 --> 02:40.650
Mallory.

02:41.580 --> 02:44.029
Go on, Mallory.

02:45.386 --> 02:47.522

02:47.547 --> 02:49.487
Thank you.

02:49.797 --> 02:51.625
It's Valerie.

02:51.705 --> 02:54.372
All right, democracy in action.
Listen. Thanks, Megan.

02:54.397 --> 02:56.558
- You have yourself a nice day.
- Yeah.

02:58.336 --> 03:00.079
Excuse me, sir. Are you re...

03:00.104 --> 03:01.506
Sir.

03:03.086 --> 03:05.175
Do you ever think about maybe
shutting down your phone

03:05.176 --> 03:07.619
and just tuning in
to the world around you?

03:07.644 --> 03:08.805
Once.

03:08.886 --> 03:11.765
Yeah, but then I realized I was
standing in a parking lot

03:11.766 --> 03:13.786
and it got too real too fast

03:14.019 --> 03:15.853
This is all a big joke to you, huh?

03:16.107 --> 03:19.402
Well, they say laughter is
the best medicine for despair.

03:19.427 --> 03:22.974
People are gonna sum up your
generation in one word...

03:23.028 --> 03:25.081
- Scapegoat?
- Entitled.

03:25.106 --> 03:27.398
You're asking people to sign
paper for money.

03:27.399 --> 03:29.441
Okay? It's not exactly Standing Rock.

03:29.466 --> 03:31.467
You know, fights need foot
soldiers too, huh?

03:31.492 --> 03:34.514
And that includes skilled petitioners.

03:34.594 --> 03:35.470
Skilled?

03:35.611 --> 03:37.163
Anyone could do this job.

03:37.188 --> 03:39.416
Yeah, almost anyone.

03:59.598 --> 04:02.143
- Fuck.
- What do you think? Too much?

04:02.168 --> 04:03.997
Uh, just depends on
what you were going for.

04:04.022 --> 04:05.272
Eight hours of rigor mortis,

04:05.416 --> 04:08.016
12-inch knife wound, self-inflicted.

04:10.148 --> 04:12.860
- Then I think you nailed it.
- Dude, thanks.

04:13.055 --> 04:13.973
Glad you approve.

04:13.998 --> 04:15.080
I wouldn't say that.

04:15.105 --> 04:18.315
No, in New York, no one gives
a shit about FX makeup.

04:18.394 --> 04:19.937
That's crazy, right?

04:20.084 --> 04:22.277
In a city full of monsters.

04:23.037 --> 04:26.872
Anyway, just happy to be in this
supportive community.

04:27.292 --> 04:29.942
You ever seen
"Skeletons Fight For Flesh"?

04:30.112 --> 04:31.780
Oh, it's the best!

04:31.805 --> 04:32.888
They're making a sequel.

04:32.913 --> 04:35.776
I'm out here for eight seconds,
and already I'm going in

04:35.801 --> 04:37.343
for a meeting with the prop master.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.366
It's like...

04:39.391 --> 04:42.239
Crazy, but awesome.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.089
Wish me luck.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.928
Oh! Also stoked this worked out,

04:46.953 --> 04:47.935
'cause there's some, like,

04:47.960 --> 04:49.536
some real weirdos
in the Airbnb community.

04:49.561 --> 04:50.730
Can't be too careful, you know?

04:50.731 --> 04:53.102
- Easy. You're gonna run into...
- I... yep.

04:53.578 --> 04:54.538
Cool base.

04:58.886 --> 05:00.954
Every car on the road is an opportunity.

05:01.027 --> 05:03.274
It's a chance for us to
make a dent in climate change.

05:03.299 --> 05:05.009
Aren't you just the cutest!

05:05.122 --> 05:06.475
- If we can all just...
- What's her name?

05:06.500 --> 05:07.681
Oh, Holly.

05:07.688 --> 05:09.104
No way. That's my mom's name.

05:09.105 --> 05:11.314
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, after Buddy Holly.

05:11.315 --> 05:13.651
- I love Buddy Holly.
- Me too.

05:13.651 --> 05:14.527
Hey, okay.

05:14.528 --> 05:15.806
I know you've been
talking to Tracy here,

05:15.831 --> 05:18.071
but would you mind
signing my petition sheet?

05:18.072 --> 05:20.908
You know, I'm just trying to
prove to my mom that I can do this.

05:21.136 --> 05:22.785
You know, and it would just mean
a lot to me.

05:22.786 --> 05:23.661
Of course.

05:23.662 --> 05:25.864
Good for you for taking the initiative.

05:25.948 --> 05:28.704
Whoa, those are some cool shoes.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.793
They're kind of like mine,
only yours are sparkly,

05:30.794 --> 05:32.293
which makes them way cooler.

05:32.294 --> 05:33.377
I'm jealous.

05:33.402 --> 05:36.378
- Thank you. Really appreciate it.
- No problem.

05:36.403 --> 05:38.358
- Thanks. Have a great day.
- Bye, Holly!

05:39.320 --> 05:41.361
You little shit.

05:41.386 --> 05:42.846
Oh, Tracy, come on.

05:42.847 --> 05:45.682
This is bigger than you and me, right?

05:45.683 --> 05:50.319
This is about the world.
It's about making a difference.

05:50.463 --> 05:52.673
It's about the future.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.445
Wow, bikes always remind me of my dad.

05:59.511 --> 06:01.448
He fell off his, and now he's
paralyzed from the waist down.

06:01.473 --> 06:04.230
- Hey, will you sign this petition?
- Yeah.

06:06.663 --> 06:08.120
Wow, that's a great shirt.

06:08.186 --> 06:10.283
Hey, you ever think about how
we're selling oil to people

06:10.356 --> 06:12.876
who hate our way of life
and probably want us dead?

06:12.877 --> 06:13.628
Mm.

06:13.629 --> 06:15.170
I mean, like, Arizona in August.

06:15.171 --> 06:16.337
You can't even wear black.

06:16.338 --> 06:19.676
That's LA in 20 years
if we don't get to work.

06:20.004 --> 06:20.963
I mean, look.

06:21.011 --> 06:22.923
Is global warming a Chinese conspiracy?

06:22.970 --> 06:23.942
I'm not a scientist.

06:23.967 --> 06:26.202
But if you sign this, I get 65,

06:26.227 --> 06:29.393
and it'll help get rid
of my awful tattoo.

06:45.510 --> 06:48.877
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:49.723 --> 06:51.348
That was fun the other night.

06:51.373 --> 06:53.591
Yeah, it was very fun.

06:54.059 --> 06:56.732
We should hang again sometime.

06:57.397 --> 07:02.792
Okay. Hello, everybody.

07:03.442 --> 07:04.360
I confess.

07:04.555 --> 07:06.825
Last week was tough, I know.

07:07.933 --> 07:09.858
But we gained an understanding

07:09.883 --> 07:14.468
that it's not just words
that shape our stories.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.580
It's our bodies.

07:16.685 --> 07:18.534
Yeah? So how do we use that?

07:18.629 --> 07:22.034
How do we take advantage of that?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.740
First, we have to understand...

07:24.741 --> 07:26.688
When are you free?

07:26.802 --> 07:28.855
How about tomorrow night?

07:29.972 --> 07:31.014
Tomorrow's good.

07:31.039 --> 07:32.524
- Then we can work on...
- Cool.

07:32.549 --> 07:35.626
Reflecting or subverting those feelings.

07:35.627 --> 07:37.207
The "Mad Men" stuff is over.

07:37.287 --> 07:40.902
TV spots, pretty campaigns,
their reach is negligible.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.240
Yeah, any brand who wants to
target consumers who matter,

07:43.265 --> 07:44.302
they come to us.

07:44.303 --> 07:46.553
The right influencer paired
with the right product

07:46.554 --> 07:48.860
can generate millions of impressions

07:48.885 --> 07:50.901
and, by extension, millions of sales.

07:50.926 --> 07:53.360
Yeah, do you know how much
Kim Kardashian charges

07:53.385 --> 07:54.645
for a sponsored Instagram post?

07:54.670 --> 07:59.106
- I...
- $700,000.

07:59.185 --> 08:00.269
For one picture?

08:00.294 --> 08:02.486
- We could get her $750.
- We will get her $750.

08:02.487 --> 08:03.612
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:03.613 --> 08:04.738
And how would I fit in?

08:04.739 --> 08:05.948
We want to grow beyond talent.

08:05.949 --> 08:09.076
Packaging, content production,
even apps.

08:09.077 --> 08:10.178
It's all on the horizon.

08:10.203 --> 08:13.231
And as chief technology
officer, I would, what,

08:13.256 --> 08:14.331
head up a development team?

08:14.332 --> 08:16.997
Uh, yeah, eventually that's...
that's the hope.

08:17.022 --> 08:18.844
Yeah, we're still in
our capital building phase.

08:18.869 --> 08:21.119
Our IPO's another year or two
away, so...

08:21.144 --> 08:24.633
The CTO is more of an IT professional.

08:24.634 --> 08:25.426
Yeah.

08:25.832 --> 08:28.601
So you want me to be the guy

08:28.626 --> 08:30.013
who tells you how to restart
your computer?

08:30.014 --> 08:31.640
Oh, no.

08:31.641 --> 08:33.392
No, no.

08:33.393 --> 08:34.804
That's a stereotype.

08:34.830 --> 08:37.164
IT's critical to a business like ours.

08:37.190 --> 08:39.219
Yeah, well, that's why we
rebranded the position.

08:39.220 --> 08:41.000
I mean, calling something
by a different name

08:41.025 --> 08:42.400
doesn't change what it is.

08:42.426 --> 08:44.336
- That's debatable.
- Is it?

08:44.361 --> 08:46.036
Oh, look. You know, we get it.

08:46.061 --> 08:49.011
It's a new role for you.
But you'd be getting in early.

08:49.036 --> 08:50.938
Yeah, and there's a real
opportunity for growth

08:50.963 --> 08:53.286
in a world you may be aging out of?

08:53.287 --> 08:55.818
- Wow. Okay.
- I'm sorry.

08:55.843 --> 08:57.207
It's just the people we meet your age,

08:57.208 --> 08:58.917
they're not versed
in the newer languages:

08:58.918 --> 09:00.875
Swift, Julia, Google Go.

09:00.953 --> 09:04.145
But... but for all I know,
you're fluent in all of them.

09:04.700 --> 09:08.012
- So think it over. Let us know.
- Yeah.

09:08.012 --> 09:09.970
- I will.
- Cool.

09:09.971 --> 09:11.153
- Thanks.
- Yeah, great.

09:11.178 --> 09:13.241
- Thanks for coming in.
- Thank you.

09:14.267 --> 09:15.809
Thanks.

09:15.810 --> 09:18.021
Yeah, thanks.

09:18.889 --> 09:21.835
- Oh, it's sliding.
- Yep, sliding. Okay.

09:32.517 --> 09:33.600
Hey, there.

09:33.802 --> 09:36.618
Got a minute to stick it
to the oligarchy?

09:38.666 --> 09:40.834
What do you think these
signatures are for?

09:40.835 --> 09:42.462
Clean energy initiatives.

09:42.463 --> 09:45.881
- Like what?
- Uh, research, subsidies...

09:45.882 --> 09:47.007
What kind of subsidies?

09:47.008 --> 09:48.988
Fuel-efficient cars.

09:49.795 --> 09:51.839
- $3 billion worth?
- Uh-huh.

09:52.014 --> 09:54.021
And who do you think benefits from that?

09:54.065 --> 09:55.947
Everyone?

09:57.733 --> 09:59.728
Who's paying you for these signatures?

09:59.729 --> 10:01.049
People.

10:01.074 --> 10:03.562
You don't think maybe the
people backing this initiative

10:03.587 --> 10:05.918
have a less than philanthropic agenda?

10:07.028 --> 10:08.195
What do you know?

10:08.196 --> 10:09.072
Nothing.

10:09.073 --> 10:11.479
I'm just a concerned citizen
of the world...

10:11.699 --> 10:13.576
like you.

10:19.386 --> 10:21.807
It's ridiculous.
I didn't start a company

10:21.832 --> 10:25.089
to argue semantics with Kim
Kardashian's social media pimps.

10:25.114 --> 10:27.667
Do I command that little respect now?

10:27.882 --> 10:28.841
It's demeaning.

10:28.842 --> 10:31.621
Yes. Yes, it is. It's very demeaning.

10:32.053 --> 10:33.303
Hi, honey.

10:33.537 --> 10:35.890
- How was harassing strangers?
- Fine.

10:35.950 --> 10:39.003
Have you guys heard of
the Clean Renewables Institute?

10:39.089 --> 10:40.256
- No.
- Nope.

10:40.703 --> 10:42.078
It's the group behind my petition.

10:42.103 --> 10:43.558
And some woman said that it was, like...

10:43.583 --> 10:45.107
Not what it...

10:45.108 --> 10:45.900
What?

10:45.901 --> 10:48.694
- Top-Knot wants to go out to dinner.
- The horror!

10:48.695 --> 10:51.782
He said he wants to hang.
"Hang" means "hook up." Not eat.

10:51.807 --> 10:54.261
- You can't do both?
- I can.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.600
I just... I'm gonna have to get
half a portion of food

10:56.625 --> 10:58.700
or, like, a side salad
so I look good naked

10:58.725 --> 11:00.132
and the whole time
I'm gonna be thinking about

11:00.157 --> 11:02.947
how hungry I am and how
I can't wait for him to finish

11:02.972 --> 11:04.586
so I can hurry up and pick up a burrito.

11:04.611 --> 11:06.711
- Ghost him.
- Straight to the shadow realm.

11:06.712 --> 11:07.672
I can't.

11:07.673 --> 11:09.160
He's in my class.

11:09.185 --> 11:11.842
both: Oh, no.

11:11.843 --> 11:13.425
Now I just want a burrito.

11:13.450 --> 11:14.680
- Mm.
- _

11:14.705 --> 11:17.431
I have a potentially terrible idea.

11:18.349 --> 11:20.225
Hmm. You like alpacas.

11:20.254 --> 11:22.198
Oh, yeah, I love alpacas.

11:22.329 --> 11:23.454
How delightful.

11:23.479 --> 11:25.314
Have you ever seen one?

11:25.339 --> 11:27.636
I have a sweater.

11:27.875 --> 11:29.543
Oh.

11:33.948 --> 11:36.160
So when's the last time
you sang with someone?

11:36.185 --> 11:39.375
Uh, when... that I... What?

11:39.400 --> 11:42.826
It's one of the 36 questions.
"The New York Times"?

11:43.081 --> 11:44.892
Okay. Oh, those...

11:44.917 --> 11:46.267
Like, for me, I sing,

11:46.292 --> 11:48.992
but mostly just alone in the shower.

11:49.130 --> 11:50.672
Maybe you'll hear it.

11:50.673 --> 11:52.466
Mm.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.217
What's your perfect day?

11:54.218 --> 11:55.969
Oh.

11:55.970 --> 11:59.347
Um, I think it's... yeah, excuse me.

11:59.348 --> 12:01.433
Hi. Yeah. Okay.

12:01.434 --> 12:03.023
- Um...
- Have we decided?

12:03.048 --> 12:05.103
- Let's see.
- We'll do the tasting menu.

12:05.104 --> 12:06.564
Is that okay with you? All right?

12:06.565 --> 12:09.196
- Well, that's a lot.
- And if you're interested in the soufflé,

12:09.283 --> 12:11.822
I suggest you order now.
It takes 45 minutes to prepare.

12:11.882 --> 12:13.132
Ooh.

12:13.279 --> 12:14.447
Love soufflé.

12:14.448 --> 12:16.179
Let's do it. Let's do it.

12:16.204 --> 12:19.521
Actually, um, I'd prefer the...
the cheese plate,

12:19.546 --> 12:21.839
if that's all right with you, so...

12:21.996 --> 12:24.289
Fuck the soufflé.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.616
Perfect.

12:25.750 --> 12:26.817
So cheese, huh?

12:26.842 --> 12:29.062
- Mm-hmm.
- Where'd that start?

12:31.136 --> 12:34.974
Ah, I can't really tell how hungry I am.

12:36.177 --> 12:37.260
Do you do this a lot?

12:37.261 --> 12:39.334
- App date?
- No, not recently.

12:39.407 --> 12:40.981
I guess your profile just spoke to me.

12:41.006 --> 12:42.600
Oh, I'm sure it had nothing
to do with the fact

12:42.601 --> 12:44.101
that I was like 100 feet away.

12:44.126 --> 12:47.438
Well, don't you just love
life's little coincidences?

12:48.440 --> 12:49.440
So what do you do?

12:49.441 --> 12:51.191
- In life?
- In work.

12:51.704 --> 12:53.319
- Do you know Snooger?
- Sure.

12:53.320 --> 12:54.731
Yup, my baby.

12:54.756 --> 12:55.904
- Oh, wow.
- That's me.

12:55.929 --> 12:58.042
Founded it, cashed out,
and now here we are.

12:58.067 --> 13:00.647
- Good for you.
- Never thought I'd be one of those...

13:00.781 --> 13:03.564
dot-com guys, but there
are worse things, I guess.

13:03.589 --> 13:05.471
- Yeah, there are.
- Yeah.

13:05.598 --> 13:07.415
So you probably know, then,

13:07.638 --> 13:09.158
why people keep coming back.

13:09.318 --> 13:11.191
You know, why the app is so appealing.

13:11.463 --> 13:12.963
Yeah, I have my theories.

13:12.964 --> 13:13.923
Yeah, me too.

13:13.924 --> 13:15.423
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

13:15.424 --> 13:17.218
And they are?

13:19.315 --> 13:20.400
I think it's the swipe.

13:20.514 --> 13:22.109
You know, it's just that gesture.

13:22.209 --> 13:24.129
- Yeah?
- There's no movement.

13:24.180 --> 13:26.955
No time wasted. And it's so elegant,

13:26.980 --> 13:28.230
it's like a conductor with a wand.

13:28.312 --> 13:31.848
You know, and one swipe can
unlock a person in an instant.

13:31.905 --> 13:33.918
Like a video game or something.

13:34.135 --> 13:37.909
And it just opens up this world
of all these different possibilities

13:37.934 --> 13:39.677
and all these energies, and it's...

13:39.702 --> 13:41.270
It's pretty cool.

13:41.592 --> 13:44.077
Sorry. I'm rambling.

13:46.289 --> 13:47.824
What?

13:47.915 --> 13:49.337
Nothing.

13:49.597 --> 13:50.638
Oh, come on.

13:50.752 --> 13:52.043
That was just very insightful.

13:52.044 --> 13:53.713
And weirdly passionate.

13:53.714 --> 13:54.631
Thank you.

13:54.632 --> 13:57.154
You know, I've thought a lot about this.

13:57.179 --> 13:59.843
Why go into it if you're
not gonna do the research?

13:59.844 --> 14:00.969
I totally agree.

14:00.970 --> 14:02.505
Yeah, I, um...

14:02.545 --> 14:04.399
- You're 28?
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.424 --> 14:05.841
And you own a home.

14:05.866 --> 14:07.039
Have a career.

14:07.064 --> 14:08.869
That's... that's impressive.

14:08.894 --> 14:10.479
I had help from my parents.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.063
Which I used to be ashamed about,

14:12.064 --> 14:14.190
but, you know, I realized that

14:14.635 --> 14:17.152
you can't live your whole life
apologizing for something

14:17.153 --> 14:18.446
that's out of your control.

14:18.447 --> 14:19.530
It's what you do with it.

14:19.531 --> 14:21.742
So now I just want to work
and give a little back

14:21.767 --> 14:25.207
and find a guy that
has his shit together.

14:25.810 --> 14:28.027
Yeah. I'll drink to that.

14:28.749 --> 14:31.243
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

14:34.081 --> 14:36.996
You're so funny. That's so rare.

14:37.103 --> 14:38.731
You don't meet many women who...

14:38.883 --> 14:40.677
Who what?

14:43.115 --> 14:44.741
You know what?

14:44.889 --> 14:47.543
I just... I can't get
that soufflé out of my mind.

14:47.622 --> 14:50.520
- Can we just put one in?
- Perfect.

14:50.521 --> 14:52.563
Thank you. Oh, don't worry.

14:52.564 --> 14:54.523
We'll still get the cheese plate.

14:55.776 --> 14:57.777
- Yeah.
- That's crazy.

14:57.778 --> 15:00.095
I know. Exes are awkward enough,

15:00.135 --> 15:02.484
but add in a pregnancy
and it fucks with you.

15:02.509 --> 15:03.842
Yeah, I get it.

15:03.867 --> 15:05.665
But here's the craziest part.

15:06.501 --> 15:10.003
My whole life, I've been
mortally afraid of this.

15:10.028 --> 15:11.350
- The accidental pregnancy.
- Mm.

15:11.375 --> 15:14.292
Being locked into something
without being prepared for it.

15:14.442 --> 15:17.971
But when she told me it wasn't mine...

15:18.731 --> 15:20.397
I don't know.

15:20.422 --> 15:21.911
It kinda broke my heart.

15:22.487 --> 15:24.818
Sorry. I know I'm not
supposed to say that.

15:24.843 --> 15:27.984
- No, no, you can totally say that.
- I just don't want to be an old dad.

15:28.009 --> 15:30.969
And if I keep fucking around for
five more years, then what?

15:30.994 --> 15:32.829
I wake up, and I'm in my 40s,

15:32.854 --> 15:34.772
and my knees fuckin' hurt,

15:34.773 --> 15:36.272
and I wonder where my life went.

15:36.273 --> 15:38.108
Yeah, I totally want a family too.

15:38.109 --> 15:39.610
You know, but everywhere I look,

15:39.611 --> 15:40.778
I see the same messaging.

15:40.779 --> 15:41.821
Wait until you're older.

15:41.822 --> 15:45.031
Don't sacrifice your dreams
to have a family.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.617
Everyone says that to me.

15:46.618 --> 15:48.836
But what if having a family is my dream?

15:48.861 --> 15:51.832
Well then, I think that's
a wonderful dream.

15:54.459 --> 15:56.669
Any religious affiliation?

15:56.670 --> 15:57.919
Agnostic.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.630
Outstanding warrants?

15:59.631 --> 16:01.005
Not that I'm aware of.

16:01.006 --> 16:01.966
Disease-free?

16:01.967 --> 16:03.962
With quarterly checkups.

16:04.051 --> 16:07.017
- Should we go back to my place?
- I'll call the car.

16:07.157 --> 16:08.825
I'll be right back.

16:10.028 --> 16:11.624
Excuse me.

16:23.811 --> 16:25.980
- Oh, hey.
- He won't stop looking at me.

16:26.005 --> 16:27.991
- We're gonna take off.
- Wait... what?

16:27.992 --> 16:29.886
Yeah. She's amazing. What a night.

16:29.911 --> 16:33.581
Alex, this guy is like raw plutonium

16:33.582 --> 16:36.001
radiating poison into my skin

16:36.026 --> 16:39.408
and breaking me down with his
toxic lack of self-awareness.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.714
My Uber's here.

16:41.715 --> 16:42.738
And it's surge pricing,

16:42.763 --> 16:45.045
so I really don't want to make him wait.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.905
Go have fun. Bye!

16:52.262 --> 16:55.375
Mmm, my God, this soufflé is so good.

16:55.502 --> 16:59.409
- You should try some.
- Nah. I'm good.

17:02.109 --> 17:03.169
That was impressive.

17:03.591 --> 17:06.691
Byron, if you keep ordering me drinks...

17:08.115 --> 17:09.971
I'm gonna keep drinking 'em.

17:10.044 --> 17:13.723
'Cause that's the kind of night
that I'm having.

17:13.844 --> 17:16.218
Have a wonderful night.

17:18.818 --> 17:20.050
What? Oh.

17:20.170 --> 17:22.922
No, I paid when you
went to the bathroom.

17:22.923 --> 17:24.263
Just a little trick I picked up.

17:24.289 --> 17:25.611
Oh, wow.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.198
- Yeah.
- Sneaky tricks.

17:29.223 --> 17:30.221
Wow.

17:30.222 --> 17:34.220
Well, that is very, very...

17:34.768 --> 17:37.987
very thoughtful.

17:38.103 --> 17:39.700
My pleasure.

17:39.814 --> 17:41.314
So what do you say?

17:41.392 --> 17:43.839
Do you have the energy
for one last stop?

17:43.932 --> 17:46.253
Maybe a little nightcap at your place?

17:49.031 --> 17:50.866
Hey, hey.

17:50.867 --> 17:52.743
Look at me.

17:52.744 --> 17:54.118
Just look at me.

17:54.119 --> 17:56.754
Yeah. Right here.

17:57.850 --> 17:58.850
I'm gonna cum.

17:58.875 --> 18:00.584
Will you cum with me?

18:00.585 --> 18:03.154
Um... sure.

18:28.933 --> 18:30.519
Hi.

18:30.736 --> 18:32.312
Hi.

18:32.839 --> 18:36.153
- That was incredible, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

18:37.375 --> 18:39.210
Great.

18:43.254 --> 18:46.432
_

18:52.559 --> 18:54.519
Goodnight, Byron.

18:56.937 --> 18:58.817
Goodnight.

19:04.639 --> 19:05.888
Move the hot tamale.

19:05.913 --> 19:07.293
Now the blue sucker.

19:07.318 --> 19:08.674
You'll get a candy avalanche.

19:08.699 --> 19:10.127
Dumb.

19:10.152 --> 19:12.111
I'll get us a table.

19:13.097 --> 19:14.743
You again.

19:15.338 --> 19:17.063
Oh, you remember me?

19:17.437 --> 19:18.479
Can't forget you.

19:18.580 --> 19:20.288
So what, your boyfriend afraid of me?

19:20.289 --> 19:22.373
Um, well, he's my brother.

19:22.374 --> 19:24.895
And yeah, probably.

19:25.056 --> 19:27.099
All right, then.

19:27.547 --> 19:28.839
I'll call you when it's ready.

19:28.840 --> 19:31.635
Okay.

19:31.659 --> 19:32.940
_

19:38.949 --> 19:40.009
Hm?

19:40.034 --> 19:41.356
Hey wrote, "Hey bb."

19:41.435 --> 19:43.109
- Top-Knot?
- Mm-hmm.

19:43.575 --> 19:45.812
- Ugh.
- When's your next class?

19:45.940 --> 19:47.351
- Tonight.
- Yikes.

19:47.376 --> 19:48.793
It is so bad.

19:48.870 --> 19:51.862
I drank all the gin just to un-hear him,

19:51.887 --> 19:54.107
and he would not stop talking.

19:54.132 --> 19:55.449
You got to nip this in the bud.

19:55.450 --> 19:56.784
- I mean, how?
- Text him.

19:56.785 --> 19:58.654
Tell him you want to be friends.
Short and sweet.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.106
Yeah, but I don't want to be friends.

20:00.131 --> 20:01.256
I just want the benefits.

20:01.288 --> 20:02.831
Well, then get 'em somewhere else.

20:02.832 --> 20:04.753
- Trust me.
- How's my landlord?

20:05.035 --> 20:07.628
- I'm seeing her again tonight.
- Ugh. Unbelievable.

20:07.629 --> 20:09.922
Val, listen, she's incredible.

20:09.923 --> 20:12.382
She's honest, driven...

20:12.501 --> 20:14.258
knows exactly what she wants.

20:14.327 --> 20:15.426
I mean, it's almost scary.

20:15.427 --> 20:18.227
To reconnect with Emmy,
and then just like that,

20:18.321 --> 20:20.533
meet someone who checks all the boxes?

20:20.558 --> 20:21.767
I mean, what are the odds?

20:21.768 --> 20:23.378
What are the odds?

20:23.543 --> 20:25.551
- You're on tilt.
- What?

20:25.581 --> 20:27.292
Mallory!

20:30.640 --> 20:32.575
- Close enough.
- Yeah.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.317
One day of work, huh?
That's all you had in you?

20:41.342 --> 20:43.575
- Not now.
- I guess it's for the best.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.547
When the world starts boiling
and it's too hot to move,

20:45.548 --> 20:47.507
you'll be perfectly prepared.

20:47.508 --> 20:49.084
Entitled Millennial.

20:49.109 --> 20:50.151
Fuck you.

20:50.797 --> 20:52.657
You're a fucking fraud.

20:52.682 --> 20:54.140
You don't give a shit about me.

20:54.265 --> 20:56.432
The Clean Renewables Institute?

20:56.583 --> 21:00.203
It's a group of rich old men
who want to sell natural gas.

21:00.228 --> 21:01.183
Keep your voice down.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.083
Why, are you afraid people
are gonna quit signing?

21:03.398 --> 21:06.764
God, you're just a fucking user,
like everyone else.

21:06.789 --> 21:08.304
No, you know what?
You're worse than that.

21:08.329 --> 21:11.530
Because you fucking know better,
and you still sell this shit.

21:11.555 --> 21:13.538
And you're right, the world
probably is gonna boil.

21:13.563 --> 21:15.245
But at least you'll have enough money

21:15.270 --> 21:16.941
to run your fucking air conditioning.

21:16.966 --> 21:18.885
Congratulations!

21:53.092 --> 22:00.072
_

22:20.902 --> 22:22.362
You all right?

22:22.387 --> 22:24.056
I'm fine.

22:25.459 --> 22:26.918
What was that about?

22:26.943 --> 22:31.196
Nothing. It's just the stupid petition.

22:33.251 --> 22:35.466
Okay.

22:35.745 --> 22:37.545
God.

22:38.269 --> 22:40.155
I'm a fuck-up.

22:40.601 --> 22:43.688
Even when I try to do good,
it turns bad.

22:45.986 --> 22:48.591
At least you're trying.

22:49.968 --> 22:53.650
That's what you say to someone who's
destined for failure.

22:59.335 --> 23:02.475
Well, I'm always looking for interns.

23:03.026 --> 23:05.488
Failures need not apply.

23:05.839 --> 23:07.802
_

23:18.531 --> 23:20.657
That was probably illegal, huh?

23:20.799 --> 23:22.352
Super illegal.

23:31.272 --> 23:32.932
So, how did you know?

23:32.966 --> 23:36.319
I went to the shelter a couple times.

23:36.594 --> 23:38.424
And the two times that we met,

23:38.537 --> 23:42.370
we locked eyes,
and he's got the cutest...

23:42.618 --> 23:45.493
Little face, and these human eyes,

23:45.518 --> 23:46.810
and it was, um...

23:47.313 --> 23:49.007
it was an instant connection.

23:49.190 --> 23:50.544
You just know.

23:50.608 --> 23:52.577
Yeah. I miss my dog.

23:54.126 --> 23:55.264
- Carl.
- Aw.

23:55.289 --> 23:57.582
Well, you should get another one.

23:57.753 --> 23:59.293
I got the space.

23:59.435 --> 24:00.806
You do.

24:00.979 --> 24:02.312
You do.

24:02.453 --> 24:04.566
I knew I'd love your place.

24:04.706 --> 24:08.323
- My temple on the hill.
- Yeah.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.342
So.

24:11.963 --> 24:13.130
So...

24:13.217 --> 24:15.968
how about you show me the rest of it?

24:16.217 --> 24:17.628
Okay.

24:44.591 --> 24:48.756
Hello. Welcome, everyone.

24:49.625 --> 24:51.699
Okay.

24:51.872 --> 24:52.832
So.

24:52.913 --> 24:55.093
Who wants to go first?

24:57.753 --> 24:59.592
Byron. Fantastic.

24:59.745 --> 25:02.086
Please, take the stage.

25:15.130 --> 25:16.714
It started with Whitney Houston.

25:17.028 --> 25:19.299
"The Greatest Love of All."

25:19.451 --> 25:21.492
I'd heard that song a million times,

25:21.619 --> 25:23.432
but I never really thought about it.

25:23.499 --> 25:25.506
Nor did I think of it then.

25:25.623 --> 25:28.456
For my thoughts were only of her.

25:28.682 --> 25:30.616
Our first encounter.

25:31.085 --> 25:32.377
It was brief,

25:32.561 --> 25:36.903
but tonight's dinner was
to bring our spring to bloom.

25:37.009 --> 25:39.071
I took her aboard a cuisine cruise

25:39.096 --> 25:42.816
of seven courses, each more
lavish than the last.

25:44.136 --> 25:46.219
But it wasn't enough.

25:47.221 --> 25:51.684
I opened my heart, praised her wit...

25:52.149 --> 25:54.359
But she toyed with me.

25:54.607 --> 25:57.376
Like a cat with a rat,
she shunned my eyes

25:57.657 --> 26:00.077
and plundered my soul's vessel.

26:01.266 --> 26:02.476
At home, I lay awake,

26:02.501 --> 26:04.660
tending to my shaken core.

26:04.783 --> 26:07.074
Was I still Byron?

26:07.853 --> 26:11.394
Or had she taken that from me too?

26:12.774 --> 26:14.626
I soon realized the answer,

26:14.713 --> 26:17.060
for I'd heard it earlier that night.

26:18.096 --> 26:22.151
If I fail, if I succeed.

26:22.353 --> 26:24.271
no matter what they take from me,

26:24.345 --> 26:29.037
they can't take away my dignity.

26:31.942 --> 26:34.395
And that is the greatest love of all.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.263
Thank you.

26:38.860 --> 26:41.375
Yes. We can clap.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.188
Definitely clap.

26:44.264 --> 26:46.613
So sorry, that was...

26:46.683 --> 26:48.601
really, really, good.

26:48.868 --> 26:51.174
Yeah. That was great.

27:03.942 --> 27:05.584
Oh!

27:08.019 --> 27:09.436
Hi! Hi! Hi, hi, hi.

27:09.506 --> 27:10.540
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:10.572 --> 27:13.487
- Hey, who's this?
- Oh, I'm Rae.

27:13.512 --> 27:16.012
I'm... sorry, I'm Alex's Airbnb.

27:16.037 --> 27:17.291
So that's it.

27:17.316 --> 27:20.651
Dude! I got the job on the movie.

27:22.028 --> 27:24.146
So, um, yeah, and I, uh...

27:24.232 --> 27:27.906
I was thinking, what if
I stayed in the room

27:27.931 --> 27:30.349
and rented in more of like
a longer-term situation?

27:30.462 --> 27:32.078
- Uh...
- 'Cause I know money's tight.

27:32.079 --> 27:33.581
You know, and you're looking for work,

27:33.582 --> 27:34.748
so even if it's, you know,

27:34.749 --> 27:36.958
till you find something, whatever,

27:36.959 --> 27:39.096
it would really help me out.

27:39.289 --> 27:40.921
- Right.
- You guys want drinks?

27:40.922 --> 27:42.172
- No thanks.
- No.

27:42.173 --> 27:45.103
She's cute. Nice meeting you.

27:45.128 --> 27:46.753
I know. I'm sorry.

27:46.778 --> 27:48.493
It's just... it's so crazy.

27:48.518 --> 27:50.127
I don't understand.
She needs you right now?

27:50.152 --> 27:52.015
Yeah. Yeah, you know, she's my boss.

27:52.016 --> 27:53.475
This happens sometimes.

27:53.476 --> 27:55.198
- I'm really sorry.
- Yeah, but it's...

27:55.223 --> 27:56.264
it's 11:00 at night.

27:56.289 --> 27:58.713
Yeah, it is.
And you know what? Oh, shoot.

27:58.738 --> 28:00.222
Okay, I just remembered that
I'm gonna be out of town

28:00.247 --> 28:01.555
for the next two weeks

28:01.580 --> 28:03.653
at this expo, so I'll just, um...

28:03.654 --> 28:06.624
- I'll call you when I'm back.
- You can stop.

28:07.929 --> 28:09.324
Look.

28:09.574 --> 28:11.844
You're here, and I'm here.

28:11.984 --> 28:14.287
Different timelines. That's all.

28:14.339 --> 28:15.966
Is this because of Rae?

28:16.158 --> 28:18.561
Because I can evict her. I can do that.

28:18.586 --> 28:21.002
Just toss her ass right
back out on the street.

28:21.003 --> 28:21.921
You know?

28:21.922 --> 28:23.797
We can do the things.

28:23.798 --> 28:25.257
- The things?
- Yeah.

28:25.258 --> 28:27.710
You don't have a job.

28:28.181 --> 28:30.616
Yeah. I'm sorry.

28:49.316 --> 28:50.416
You need a ride?

28:50.563 --> 28:52.482
No, I'm the late shift.

28:56.363 --> 28:58.508
You're doing all right. Right?

28:58.533 --> 28:59.923
Mm-hmm.

29:00.537 --> 29:02.703
Don't forget to wear sunscreen, okay?

29:02.728 --> 29:04.565
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

29:30.838 --> 29:32.756
Mallory.

29:32.877 --> 29:34.610
Hey, uh...

29:34.823 --> 29:37.465
do you find me attractive?

29:37.973 --> 29:39.058
I do.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.813
Do you think you can have sex
with someone

29:40.847 --> 29:41.867
you find attractive?

29:41.892 --> 29:43.762
No strings attached?

29:45.249 --> 29:47.339
- I can.
- Excellent.

29:48.018 --> 29:50.061
You don't even know my name.

29:50.176 --> 29:52.261
You don't know mine.

29:53.813 --> 29:55.372
So...

29:55.938 --> 29:57.213
No, no, no, I...

29:57.305 --> 30:00.014
just don't... don't do anything.

30:00.039 --> 30:02.216
Just leave him there, and I...

30:02.343 --> 30:05.003
no, I'm downstairs.
I'll be up in one second.

30:06.174 --> 30:08.063
Yeah, no. Just wait. Just wait.
