16:28.089 --> 16:30.089
You look terrible.
Are you drunk?

16:30.172 --> 16:31.964
-Probably.
-LINDA: Jesus, Perry.

16:32.047 --> 16:34.297
You can't show up here drunk.

16:34.381 --> 16:36.297
E.B. is dead, Lin.

16:36.381 --> 16:39.547
He-- He died. He's-- He's dead.

16:46.339 --> 16:47.589
I'm sorry.

16:49.255 --> 16:51.422
I know when your dad
passed, E.B. was--

16:51.506 --> 16:53.589
I'm not-- I'm not looking
for a hug or anything.

16:53.673 --> 16:58.881
I just-- I just wanted to spend
some time with my son.

17:00.923 --> 17:02.631
He's out back playing.

17:03.255 --> 17:04.547
Thank you.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.255
LINDA: Wait.

17:07.339 --> 17:10.089
You think you wanna come inside
and clean up a bit?

17:10.798 --> 17:12.047
I'm fine.

Standard procedure, ma'am.

Standard should include

down at Spreckel.

19:52.422 --> 19:54.673
Does dinner wait on him
or do you put

19:54.756 --> 19:56.881
a plate in the oven for later?

19:56.964 --> 20:00.130
Cher, do you mind seeing
if, uh,

20:00.214 --> 20:01.923
Teddy needs help
with his homework?

20:07.589 --> 20:08.964
He doing well in school?

20:11.923 --> 20:13.923
You're not staying for dinner.

20:16.631 --> 20:18.881
Now, I don't know what this is,
this--

this thing you're working on.

20:20.756 --> 20:23.798
You just drop by

20:25.631 --> 20:28.422
You're supposed
to send the checks.

20:28.506 --> 20:32.923
You don't. Birthdays,
Christmas, you screw that up.

And now you just show up here
and you-- (SNIFFLES)

20:38.339 --> 20:40.214
Do you know
what that does to Teddy?

20:40.297 --> 20:42.464
Well, I was thinking
maybe he could come

20:42.547 --> 20:44.631
spend some time with me
on the farm.

20:47.172 --> 20:48.798
It's hardly a farm.

20:50.547 --> 20:53.881
Well, then why'd you tell him
I'm a fucking farmer?

20:53.964 --> 20:57.089
Because I don't know
what to tell him you are.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.255

knocked in twice a week.

21:04.339 --> 21:06.130
You're supposed to be
his father.

21:06.214 --> 21:07.422
I am his father.

21:07.506 --> 21:10.047
No, Perry, you are not.

21:14.464 --> 21:16.005
That ship has sailed.

21:17.881 --> 21:19.214
ED: I'm home.

21:19.297 --> 21:21.422
CHERYL: Hi, hon.
Dinner's almost there.

21:21.506 --> 21:23.464
Do you remember
when I proposed to you?

21:25.255 --> 21:27.005
Yeah.

21:27.089 --> 21:28.756
-I said no.
-MASON: Yeah.

21:28.839 --> 21:30.130
The first time you said no.

21:30.214 --> 21:32.172
Why did you ever
say yes to me, Lin?

21:32.255 --> 21:34.839
Because for the life of me
I can't remember.

21:37.255 --> 21:39.047
ED: Come on, buddy.

21:39.130 --> 21:42.798
A-ha! I heard a rumor
and it turns out to be true.

21:42.881 --> 21:44.172
Perry Mason's in town!

21:44.255 --> 21:45.214
How are you, Ed?

ED: Well, I don't want
to jinx anything,

21:47.422 --> 21:48.881
but I got to tell ya,

21:48.964 --> 21:51.673

we're really getting
to see the other side of this.

is really taking off.

have some dinner.

22:08.214 --> 22:10.172
Tell me all
the big city buzz, fella.

22:10.255 --> 22:11.798
I'm afraid I got-- I, uh,

22:11.881 --> 22:13.506
I got--
I got to go back to work.

22:13.589 --> 22:15.714
Don't be afraid.
It's just work.

What's for eats?

22:23.714 --> 22:26.047
Oh, I've got a big spread
here tonight, Ed.

22:26.130 --> 22:28.506
-I hope you're hungry.
-Thanks, as always.

I'll-- I'll be waiting on it.

DEBATER: My esteemed opponent
has a view of our race

22:38.506 --> 22:41.506
that I do not-- cannot share.

22:41.589 --> 22:46.881
We must accept,
he says, the segregation

22:46.964 --> 22:50.464
that daily confines us
to inferior schools,

22:50.547 --> 22:52.964
inferior housing, inferior care

-if we're injured or sick.
-CROWD MEMBER: That's right.

22:55.422 --> 22:59.005
DEBATER: We must accept,
he says, the humiliation

22:59.089 --> 23:00.798
that daily denies us

23:00.881 --> 23:02.506
the simple dignity
of being human,

23:02.589 --> 23:04.381
no more, no less.

23:04.464 --> 23:07.631
All the while we are urged
to help ourselves, right?

23:07.714 --> 23:09.130
(CROWD AFFIRMS)

23:09.214 --> 23:10.714
Educate ourselves.

23:10.798 --> 23:15.881
Restrain ourselves, in hopes
that one day, one glorious day,

23:15.964 --> 23:17.714
the white man will smile
upon us and say,

23:17.798 --> 23:19.547
"Now, now I respect you."

23:22.589 --> 23:26.005
Tomorrow? Next year?
Next century?

23:26.089 --> 23:29.464
No, the only way to earn
our place is to agitate,

23:29.547 --> 23:32.964
organize,
demand that the promise

23:33.047 --> 23:34.547
of the Declaration
of Independence

23:34.631 --> 23:38.839
that all men are created equal
is a spur to justice

23:38.923 --> 23:42.297
and not the most galling
of hypocrisies.

23:42.381 --> 23:46.339
(APPLAUSE)

23:48.673 --> 23:51.839
That second debater though,
he was inspiring.

23:51.923 --> 23:54.381
Yeah, but I don't think
the reverend should be

23:54.464 --> 23:56.130
supporting radical views.

23:56.214 --> 23:58.923
Rev's just giving a chance
to both sides of the argument.

"Render unto Caesar."

-What's that got to do with it?

There's no point
in fighting to change

what's not gonna change.

24:05.798 --> 24:07.422
EDWINA:
That's what he's saying.

24:07.506 --> 24:09.839
It can't change
if we don't fight.

24:09.923 --> 24:12.047
Easy to get folks all riled up.

24:12.130 --> 24:15.297
Then you left high and dry,
and what good have you done?

24:15.381 --> 24:18.005
Well, what do you think
of it all, Officer Drake?

24:19.172 --> 24:22.255
I think it is best
to always agree with my wife.

24:22.339 --> 24:24.839
LOUISE: (CHUCKLES)
You got him well trained.

24:24.923 --> 24:28.005

24:34.547 --> 24:35.631
Miss Street?

24:35.714 --> 24:36.839
DELLA: Mother McKeegan.

24:36.923 --> 24:39.464
I'm sorry for just
dropping by like this.

24:39.547 --> 24:40.839

24:40.923 --> 24:43.130
We're very sorry

24:43.214 --> 24:46.464
Yes, well, thank you.
He's with his family now.

24:46.547 --> 24:47.506
As he should be.

The reason I'm here,

24:48.881 --> 24:51.297
first, to thank you
for organizing Emily's bail.

24:51.381 --> 24:53.422
Oh, well, Sister
deserves credit for that.

24:53.506 --> 24:54.547

24:54.631 --> 24:56.172
And now that Emily's
out of jail,

24:56.255 --> 24:58.214
we need to work on getting her
a new lawyer.

24:58.297 --> 25:00.297
Oh, well, the court just
appointed someone.

25:00.381 --> 25:02.839
They're with him
in the dining room right now.

25:07.089 --> 25:08.381
Mm.

25:12.089 --> 25:14.506
The prosecution is also
gonna be calling your husband

25:14.589 --> 25:17.339
who-- uh-oh.

25:17.422 --> 25:22.255
Herman Baggerly is your--
is your father-in-law?

25:22.339 --> 25:24.881
Yes. Sort of.

25:24.964 --> 25:27.964
Mr. Baggerly's thinking
no longer aligns with ours.

25:28.631 --> 25:30.506
(SIGHS)

25:30.589 --> 25:32.255
Miss Street, perhaps
you could tell me

25:32.339 --> 25:34.214
about the approach
Mr. Jonathan was taking.

25:34.297 --> 25:36.714
Did he have some
big secret strategy?

25:36.798 --> 25:39.422
EMILY: In our last meeting,
he mentioned

25:39.506 --> 25:41.798
-maybe a deal.
-FRANK C. DILLON: Hmm.

25:41.881 --> 25:44.130
DELLA: But we moved
away from that.

25:44.214 --> 25:46.547
We have promising
evidence coming in.

25:46.631 --> 25:47.881
DILLON: Evidence?

25:47.964 --> 25:51.714
Well, these matters warrant
more consideration.

25:51.798 --> 25:53.547
I'm going to need to see
the case files.

25:53.631 --> 25:57.714
Yes. Of course.
They're at the office.

25:57.798 --> 25:59.297
DILLON:
His office is still open?

26:00.381 --> 26:02.422
It's paid through
the end of the month.

26:02.506 --> 26:04.506
Perfect.
Tomorrow morning then.

26:07.964 --> 26:10.172
Would you excuse me a moment?

26:11.255 --> 26:12.464
I need to make a call.

26:14.714 --> 26:15.798
Okay.

26:17.506 --> 26:19.214
Where were we?

26:19.297 --> 26:21.506
-My husband testifying?
-Yes.

26:21.589 --> 26:23.964
Well, that's gonna be rough.

26:25.464 --> 26:27.673
I had my issues
with the man.

26:29.005 --> 26:34.130
There's nowhere around that
but... damn it,

26:34.214 --> 26:37.005
-last of a dying breed.
-DELLA: Mm.

26:38.756 --> 26:40.547
Had my share lately.

26:42.589 --> 26:47.839
There's talk of a, uh, gathering
down at the club.

26:47.923 --> 26:50.089
Let the muckey-mucks
say nice things about him

26:50.172 --> 26:52.756
-for a Law Review  write-up.
-E.B. would have liked that.

26:52.839 --> 26:54.798
LYLE: Darn right he would have.
(LAUGHS)

26:54.881 --> 26:58.506
Good lawyer in his day.
Big ham his whole life.

26:59.839 --> 27:03.589
Lyle, the court appointed
Frank C. Dillon in his place.

27:03.673 --> 27:04.798
LYLE: Yeah.

27:04.881 --> 27:06.964
If I'm playing with my money,
I'm betting the DA

27:07.047 --> 27:08.589
had a hand in his selection.

27:08.673 --> 27:11.089
So you think Frank
will push Emily to plead guilty?

27:11.172 --> 27:13.464
I think Frank will do
whatever helps Maynard Barnes

27:13.547 --> 27:15.130
ride this case to higher office.

27:15.214 --> 27:16.798
I'm hearing
governor talk lately.

27:16.881 --> 27:19.255
Meanwhile, an innocent woman
is being thrown to the wolves.

27:19.339 --> 27:22.297
Unfortunately, wolves don't care
about truth.

27:22.381 --> 27:23.631
They only care about meat.

27:23.714 --> 27:25.506
Which is why
I need to find Emily

27:25.589 --> 27:27.089
another lawyer immediately.

27:28.714 --> 27:30.381
I made a list.

27:30.464 --> 27:33.756
I was hoping you could
look it over for me.

27:39.547 --> 27:40.923
Let me look it over.

27:46.589 --> 27:48.214
A very thorough list.

27:48.798 --> 27:52.172
A Della Street list.

27:52.255 --> 27:55.964
Well, Reilly, Giesler, Rogers,
they're very good.

27:56.047 --> 27:59.339
They might do it for a big fat
check and the exposure.

27:59.422 --> 28:02.172
Ferris and Kavanaugh, they'd

42:02.422 --> 42:04.005
As far as I know, Mr. Dillon.

a whole lot here,

42:06.130 --> 42:07.756

about new evidence?

42:15.255 --> 42:17.005
Oh. Yes.

42:17.089 --> 42:19.339
Right. So where is it?

42:22.005 --> 42:24.005
It's not.

Well, I suppose I could dash
by Mr. Jonathan's tonight

if he took anything home.

to using these phones?

42:33.923 --> 42:35.339

42:35.422 --> 42:37.047
You pick it up
and tell the operator

42:37.130 --> 42:38.547
what number you'd like to call.

42:38.631 --> 42:40.964
Right. Bit more complicated

Maybe there is a God
with a big white stupid beard

49:15.130 --> 49:16.422
that says
"This is how it's gonna be."

49:16.506 --> 49:20.881
But, ladies and gentlemen
of the jury, we have a system

George is innocent?

50:41.506 --> 50:42.589
No.

50:42.673 --> 50:45.881

is that you need

50:45.964 --> 50:48.422

and you need it now.

We can see that you mean
what you say, Mr. Mason,

54:09.881 --> 54:13.547
He needed a new bait cooler,
which had to be in place

54:13.631 --> 54:16.881
by May 1
for the opening day of,

54:16.964 --> 54:17.923
you guessed it,

54:18.005 --> 54:21.297
the fishing season.
Write this down.

54:21.381 --> 54:27.506
On, uh, February 1, John entered
into a valid written contract...

54:42.839 --> 54:46.589
I will maintain the confidence
and preserve inviolate

54:46.673 --> 54:48.881
the secrets of my client.

54:48.964 --> 54:52.130
I will abstain from all
offensive personality

54:52.214 --> 54:55.130
unless required
by the justice of the cause

54:55.214 --> 54:56.964
with which I am charged.

54:57.047 --> 55:01.631
I will never reject the cause of
the defenseless or oppressed."

55:01.714 --> 55:03.381
So help me God.

55:04.089 --> 55:05.839
"So help me God."

MAYNARD BARNES:
A trial is society's way
of finding the truth.

57:15.756 --> 57:18.839
If I make a mistake...
someone dies.

Then don't make a mistake.
