Okay.

21:31.000 --> 21:34.302
This stuff for your head.

21:34.304 --> 21:35.428
No, thank you.

21:36.112 --> 21:37.097
Okay.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.183
So lemon tea, then? Or chamomile?

21:40.185 --> 21:42.185
Just let me read.

21:42.187 --> 21:43.228
Of course.

21:43.230 --> 21:44.847
This is scary, right?

21:45.190 --> 21:47.315
Do you ever deal
with these kind of contracts?

21:47.686 --> 21:49.024
You know I'm not a lawyer.

21:49.367 --> 21:51.820
- What do you do, again?
- I'm a composer.

21:51.822 --> 21:54.948
- Really? Of what?
- Commercials.

21:54.950 --> 21:58.284
But my real passion
is classical composition.

21:58.286 --> 22:00.176
Hey, do you know Hans Zimmer?

22:00.831 --> 22:02.791
- No.
- Oh.

22:03.417 --> 22:04.959
I like him.

22:05.877 --> 22:09.337
Well, this is designed
to protect you and, um, Fallon

22:09.339 --> 22:11.214
from wrongful termination.

22:11.216 --> 22:12.841
It creates a paper trail

22:12.843 --> 22:16.511
in case either of you is accused
of impropriety.

22:16.513 --> 22:17.959
Impropriety?

22:18.463 --> 22:20.823
She's pursuing me. I'm the victim here.

22:25.897 --> 22:28.106
Ah. Fourth king.

22:29.151 --> 22:30.464
Okay.

22:30.819 --> 22:34.320
My rule is, anytime someone
picks up a face card,

22:34.322 --> 22:35.864
you two kiss.

22:35.866 --> 22:36.990
Yeah.

22:36.992 --> 22:38.366
Oh, my God.
