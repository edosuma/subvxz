30:14.460 --> 30:15.802
and have to explain it.

30:18.420 --> 30:23.244
I can't cry over brothers
slayed by cops in the streets,

30:23.290 --> 30:25.463
and no one ever pays...

30:29.040 --> 30:30.382
and then come home
to a cop.

30:35.920 --> 30:36.909
Come on.

30:39.220 --> 30:41.529
This is crazy.

30:41.570 --> 30:42.787
I was going crazy.

30:44.930 --> 30:46.739
I can't want to share
everything With you,

30:46.800 --> 30:47.926
knowing there are
parts of me

30:47.970 --> 30:49.358
you really don't
want to know.

30:52.540 --> 30:55.498
Part of me
that loves my people

30:55.540 --> 30:59.931
more than anything
that will make me
set that aside.

31:01.990 --> 31:04.720
I never--
I never asked you
to set it aside.

31:04.770 --> 31:06.419
You never asked
about it at all.

31:12.910 --> 31:16.903
Now, just because
you wish something
is meant to be

31:16.960 --> 31:17.995
doesn't mean it is.

Once in a while,
I do something that
wakes me up

31:36.370 --> 31:41.626
Vibrates me in my skin

31:43.460 --> 31:47.112
Every now and again

31:47.160 --> 31:49.981
I tangle up instead

31:50.030 --> 31:55.946
Every now and again

31:56.000 --> 31:57.865
And the black and gray

31:57.910 --> 32:00.731
Is fading out
in front of me...

32:08.400 --> 32:10.834
It seems you've really
taken to this community.

32:13.230 --> 32:14.276
Made it your home.

32:15.930 --> 32:17.363
Right now,
I need what's here.

32:19.110 --> 32:20.099
Stability...

32:22.150 --> 32:23.105
and family.

32:25.160 --> 32:28.539
You say that as if
we aren't _still
your family.

32:28.590 --> 32:30.672
I don't know where
I stand with everyone.

32:30.730 --> 32:34.029
Well, until last week,
we didn't know where
we stood with you.

32:36.690 --> 32:37.941
Respectfully, Mom...

32:40.430 --> 32:43.775
I have written to you
for years.

32:43.830 --> 32:45.775
I have called.

32:45.830 --> 32:48.298
No response.

32:48.350 --> 32:51.478
I've been very clear
with where I've stood.

32:51.530 --> 32:53.998
No, Darla.

32:54.050 --> 32:56.052
If you had clarity,
you would know

32:56.100 --> 32:59.012
that just because
you say the words
doesn't make it true.

32:59.060 --> 33:02.234
You've said "I'm clean"

33:02.280 --> 33:04.100
or "please help me"

33:04.150 --> 33:05.538
or "I love you" before.

33:05.590 --> 33:07.808
But then you haven't
been clean

33:07.850 --> 33:09.579
or you haven't
accepted our help

33:09.630 --> 33:13.066
or you haven't
respected our love.

33:13.120 --> 33:15.725
So don't act as if
we've done you wrong,
please.

33:20.910 --> 33:21.854
You're right.

33:24.390 --> 33:26.290
I'm not trying
to scold you,

33:26.350 --> 33:28.250
but don't act as though
we've shunned you.

33:30.090 --> 33:33.435
I can only imagine
what you've told them.

33:33.480 --> 33:35.300
But if it's anything
to that effect,

33:35.360 --> 33:37.043
I'd be very disappointed.

33:41.880 --> 33:43.438
It's how I felt.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.841
Do you know
how it felt for us?

33:50.070 --> 33:53.972
Our daughter
calling us high

33:54.030 --> 33:55.509
and asking for money.

33:57.420 --> 34:01.299
Or high,
screaming in pain.

34:01.340 --> 34:05.128
Or high, threatening
to harm herself,

34:05.170 --> 34:08.037
and we are all the way
across the country,

34:08.080 --> 34:09.820
scared out of our minds.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.046
And we come for you...

34:16.790 --> 34:18.007
but you're not there.

34:19.490 --> 34:21.094
And you say
you're coming home...

34:23.190 --> 34:24.316
but you don't come.

34:26.670 --> 34:28.922
You tell us
to leave you alone...

34:31.020 --> 34:33.841
and then you call
and you demand money.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.099
You almost broke us.

34:46.120 --> 34:48.554
Eventually, we had
to create some distance.

34:51.130 --> 34:52.734
For our own sanity.

34:55.310 --> 34:56.379
For our own health.

he had a very,

35:12.630 --> 35:14.018

I've put you through.

35:45.180 --> 35:46.738
I know I broke
your heart.

I'm a mother...

I can feel

Please believe me.

Please forgive me.

I'm clean.

- Okay?

36:39.630 --> 36:43.145
When you make
amends to everyone
you've touched,

36:43.200 --> 36:44.849
you can truly be free.

36:44.890 --> 36:47.063
I want you
to feel free.

We're gonna be
all right.

- I missed you so much.
- I missed you, too.

I'm so happy
you're here.

about karma?

Enough to try avoiding
the bad kind.

I don't know what kind
of karma I have.

37:21.360 --> 37:24.363
As the wind blows,
I wonder if you know

37:24.410 --> 37:26.105
I feel
your heartbeat...

37:26.150 --> 37:28.232
Or what kind of future
youWIhave
