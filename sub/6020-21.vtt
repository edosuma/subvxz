WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.297
Hang on, let me just pick up a paper.

00:04.019 --> 00:05.294
Excuse me. Would you mind...

00:05.460 --> 00:08.338
...watching my bag for a minute?
- Yeah, no problem.

00:09.020 --> 00:11.329
- Let's go.
- Well, I gotta watch this guy's bag.

00:12.220 --> 00:16.338
- For how long?
- I'm sure he'll be back in a second.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.973
- Nice stuff.
- Come on.

00:21.220 --> 00:23.814
Excuse me, sir. Would you mind
watching my bag for a second?

00:23.980 --> 00:25.857
Why? So I can stand here
like an idiot...

00:26.020 --> 00:28.090
...not knowing
if you'll ever come back?

00:29.860 --> 00:33.330
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna be this guy's friend.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.137
- New clothes?
- Yeah, I did some shopping.

00:41.300 --> 00:43.450
Some new-clothes shopping.

00:44.220 --> 00:45.494
Can I borrow your menu?

00:45.660 --> 00:47.810
Strange, for new pants
there's noticeable wear...

00:47.980 --> 00:49.811
...on the buttocks of those chinos.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.010
Wait, those are the clothes
from the bag.

00:53.700 --> 00:54.974
The guy never came back.

00:55.140 --> 00:57.370
He asked you to watch them,
not wear them.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.656
I'm still watching them.

01:00.780 --> 01:03.692
- You look like a tourist.
- All right. Let me ask you something.

01:03.900 --> 01:06.619
When do you start to worry
about ear hair?

01:07.020 --> 01:09.693
When you hear, like, a soft rustling.

01:10.260 --> 01:12.057
Puberty that never stops.

01:12.220 --> 01:14.097
Ear puberty, nose puberty,
knuckle puberty.

01:14.260 --> 01:16.171
You gotta be vigilant.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.893
All right. Let me ask you this:

01:18.060 --> 01:19.812
You know
where Walker Street is downtown?

01:19.980 --> 01:23.495
- I got a league meeting there.
- Right, the new job. How is it?

01:23.660 --> 01:26.857
I love it. New office, new salary.
I'm the new Wilhelm.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.248
So who's the new you?

01:28.420 --> 01:31.492
They got an intern
from Francis Lewis High.

01:32.020 --> 01:34.978
His name is Keith.
He comes in Mondays after school.

01:35.340 --> 01:36.739
- Hi, Alex.
- I'm sorry I'm late.

01:36.900 --> 01:38.299
- Have you ordered yet?
- No.

01:38.460 --> 01:39.859
I'll be right back.

01:40.620 --> 01:43.339
Where are you meeting these women?
When they get off the bus...

01:43.500 --> 01:46.298
...at the Port Authority?
- Right here, George. In here.

01:47.060 --> 01:52.088
Try opening this up. You'll find
the biggest dating scene in the world.

01:52.620 --> 01:54.815
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

02:02.780 --> 02:04.054
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:04.220 --> 02:05.733
- Hi.
- Where's Jerry?

02:05.900 --> 02:07.970
Well, he's in the shower.
You want me to get him?

02:08.180 --> 02:09.579
No, no, no.

02:09.940 --> 02:11.896
Actually,
I kind of need to speak to you.

02:12.060 --> 02:15.018
Oh, well, let's sit down.

02:22.540 --> 02:26.215
Kramer, remember that whole deal
with you selling Peterman...

02:26.380 --> 02:29.417
...your stories for his book,
and then he gave them back to you?

02:30.260 --> 02:31.978
Vaguely.

02:32.380 --> 02:36.976
Well, I was kind of
short on material...

02:37.140 --> 02:40.132
...and I put them
in the book anyway.

02:40.300 --> 02:42.939
You put my life stories
in his autobiography?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.852
Kramer, listen,
it is such a stupid book.

02:45.020 --> 02:48.899
- It doesn't matter.
- No, no. Sure it matters.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.894
I've broken through, huh?

02:53.060 --> 02:57.099
I'm part of popular culture now.
Listen, I'd like to thank Mr. Peterman.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.820
He's doing a book signing
at Waldenbooks this afternoon.

02:59.980 --> 03:03.655
Waldenbooks.
That's a major chain, huh?

03:04.900 --> 03:06.538
Hey, Jerry,
I'm going to Waldenbooks.

03:06.700 --> 03:10.170
Oh, get out! Get out!
I don't wanna live like this!

03:12.620 --> 03:14.258
All right, let's go.

03:16.900 --> 03:20.210
- Mr. Lippman, how are you?
- How are you?

03:20.380 --> 03:23.929
- Well, I'm not bad. Not bad.
- What are you doing here?

03:24.100 --> 03:26.978
I work for Pendant Publishing.
This is our book.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.092
If you can call it that.

03:29.700 --> 03:33.693
Why is it every half-wit and sitcom star
has his own book out now?

03:36.700 --> 03:39.339
Hey, buddy. Remember me?

03:39.500 --> 03:42.492
You're that gangly fellow
we bought the stories from.

03:42.660 --> 03:45.970
Yeah, I'm just here to do my part.
What's your name, darling?

03:46.140 --> 03:47.812
- Who are you?
- Oh, I'm...

03:47.980 --> 03:49.732
Let me use your pen, will you?

03:50.460 --> 03:51.893
- I'm the real Peterman.

03:52.460 --> 03:54.974
All right, playtime's over.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.094
Relax, man.

03:57.260 --> 04:00.252
There's enough juice here
to keep us all fat and giggly.

04:00.620 --> 04:03.009
I can't believe somebody
pulled the top off this muffin.

04:03.180 --> 04:05.535
That was me. I'm sorry, l...

04:05.700 --> 04:08.373
I don't like the stumps.

04:09.340 --> 04:12.298
- So you just eat the tops?
- Oh, yeah, it's the best part.

04:12.460 --> 04:14.690
It's crunchy. It's explosive. It's...

04:14.860 --> 04:17.499
It's where the muffin
breaks free of the pan...

04:17.660 --> 04:20.254
...and sort of does its own thing.

04:22.019 --> 04:25.729
I'll tell you, that's a million-dollar idea
right there. Just sell the tops.

04:27.340 --> 04:28.932
Okay. Let's go, slim. That's enough.

04:29.100 --> 04:30.692
- I have a right to be here.
- Come on.

04:30.860 --> 04:33.897
These are my fans.
Hey, you're hurting my elbow.

04:36.260 --> 04:38.535
Try looking up, hayseed.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.650
You wanna sightsee, get on a bus.

04:44.060 --> 04:46.096
Please don't think
all New Yorkers are so rude.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.455
- Well, no, actually I'm...
- I'm Mary Anne.

04:48.620 --> 04:50.451
I work for the New York
Visitors Center.

04:50.620 --> 04:52.417
Where are you visiting from?

04:53.700 --> 04:55.850
Little Rock, Arkansas.

04:57.000 --> 05:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:05.420 --> 05:07.331
That looks new.

05:14.820 --> 05:17.539
So get this:
Peterman has his henchmen...

05:17.700 --> 05:20.214
...forcefully eject me
from the book signing.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.814
Like I'm some sort of maniac.

05:24.140 --> 05:26.859
- Yeah, that's too bad.
- What's the matter with you?

05:27.020 --> 05:28.772
- Nothing.
- No, no, no, don't give me that.

05:28.940 --> 05:31.534
I know you. Something's wrong.
What is it? What happened?

05:31.700 --> 05:35.488
- I did something stupid.
- What did you do?

05:35.660 --> 05:37.412
- Well, I was shaving...
- Yeah.

05:37.580 --> 05:40.378
...and I noticed an asymmetry
in my chest hair.

05:40.660 --> 05:44.130
And I was trying to even it out.
And the next thing I knew:

05:44.300 --> 05:45.574
Gone.

05:46.540 --> 05:49.179
Don't you know you're not supposed
to poke around down there?

05:49.340 --> 05:51.808
- Well, women do it.
- "Well, women do it."

05:51.980 --> 05:55.017
Well, I'll tell you what. I'll pick you up
a sundress and a parasol...

05:55.180 --> 05:58.536
...and you can just sashay your pretty
little self around the town square.

05:58.780 --> 06:01.214
- Well, what am I gonna tell Alex?
- Now, you listen to me.

06:01.380 --> 06:04.292
You don't tell anybody about this.
No one. You hear me?

06:04.460 --> 06:05.734
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:05.900 --> 06:07.970
- Jerry shaved his chest.
- Hey!

06:08.340 --> 06:10.934
I forgot. Wait, never mind.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.289
You couldn't pay me enough
to ride a horse in this city.

06:16.460 --> 06:18.530
It's hard to cross the street
in sneakers...

06:18.700 --> 06:23.171
...let alone six feet in the air
on a jittery, glassy-eyed dinosaur.

06:23.340 --> 06:25.570
How about the beach this weekend?

06:26.380 --> 06:29.178
Well, you couldn't pay me enough
to go to the beach on a weekend.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.934
- I mean, it's hard enough to park...
- All right, all right.

06:32.100 --> 06:35.536
Is that a Mexican Hairless?
I love those.

06:35.700 --> 06:41.252
Oh, hairless. This is where it's at.
It's so much smoother and cleaner.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.299
Really?

06:44.460 --> 06:47.338
Excuse me.
Are you eating a muffin top?

06:47.500 --> 06:49.889
Yeah, a muffin-top store
just opened up down the street.

06:50.820 --> 06:54.017
- A muffin-top store?
- What did I just say?

07:05.860 --> 07:07.259
Top of the muffin to you.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.493
Elaine.

07:10.020 --> 07:11.294
Mr. Lippman?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.936
So you're pretending to be a tourist?

07:16.380 --> 07:18.132
It's beautiful.

07:18.580 --> 07:20.252
She makes all the plans.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.651
I'm not from around here,
so it's okay if I'm stupid.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.572
And she knows
I'm only in town visiting...

07:26.740 --> 07:28.731
...so there's no messy break-ups.

07:28.900 --> 07:32.290
- How do you explain your apartment?
- I got a hotel room.

07:32.780 --> 07:34.498
You moved into a hotel?

07:34.660 --> 07:38.130
Well, I don't know anyone here, Jerry.
Where else am I gonna stay?

07:38.860 --> 07:43.092
So get this: We're in the park today.
Alex goes wild for this hairless dog.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.853
- So?
- So I figured...

07:45.020 --> 07:48.569
...since she likes one hairless animal,
why not another?

07:49.100 --> 07:50.692
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

07:50.860 --> 07:52.691
- You tell her you shaved it?
- Are you nuts?

07:52.860 --> 07:57.570
I don't want her to think I'm a low-rise
briefs guy who shaves his chest.

08:00.140 --> 08:01.573
Hey, Jerry!

08:03.780 --> 08:08.217
I'm starting a Peterman
Reality Bus Tour. Check it out.

08:10.340 --> 08:12.012
Reality tour?

08:12.180 --> 08:16.458
The last thing this guy is qualified
to give a tour of is reality.

08:17.060 --> 08:19.733
This was my idea.
You stole my idea.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.937
Elaine, these ideas are all in the air.
They're in the air.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.534
Oh, well, then, if that air
is coming out of this face...

08:25.700 --> 08:27.611
...then it is my air and my idea.

08:27.780 --> 08:30.374
- You want a muffin or not?
- Peach.

08:33.419 --> 08:35.570
So I've noticed you don't have
much of an accent.

08:37.620 --> 08:41.215
Yeah, my parents have it.
Sometimes it skips a generation.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.893
So I was thinking maybe tonight
we could go back to my hotel.

08:45.060 --> 08:46.891
I got Spectra Vision.

08:47.300 --> 08:49.530
First five minutes free.

08:50.700 --> 08:52.372
Look, George...

08:52.540 --> 08:55.213
...l'm really enjoying
spending time with you...

08:55.380 --> 08:58.019
...but I'm not sure
this is gonna work out.

08:58.180 --> 09:01.058
At some point you're going back
to your job at Tyler Chicken...

09:01.220 --> 09:03.131
...and your three-legged dog, Willy.

09:07.060 --> 09:09.494
And I'm still gonna be here.

09:10.100 --> 09:12.455
Well, what if I told you
I'm thinking of moving here?

09:13.980 --> 09:18.815
George, no offence,
but this city would eat you alive.

09:25.420 --> 09:28.617
You're moving to New York?
That's fantastic.

09:30.340 --> 09:32.570
I can see you all the time now.

09:33.700 --> 09:37.215
Eat me alive, huh?
We'll see who can make it in this town.

09:37.380 --> 09:42.329
- What is it she thinks you can't do?
- Find a job, get an apartment.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.138
How did you do those things?

09:45.100 --> 09:48.536
Never mind, they're done.
All I have to do now is redo them.

09:48.700 --> 09:51.772
You know, if you take everything
I've accomplished in my entire life...

09:51.940 --> 09:55.012
...and condense it down into one day,
it looks decent.

09:57.460 --> 10:00.372
Hey, what were you doing
with that bus yesterday?

10:00.540 --> 10:04.055
Here you go. Here you go.
Check it out.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.496
"The Real Peterman
Reality Bus Tour."

10:07.660 --> 10:10.015
- I'm confused.
- That Peterman book is big business.

10:10.180 --> 10:12.250
People wanna know
the stories behind the stories.

10:12.420 --> 10:14.456
Nobody wants to go
on a three-hour bus tour...

10:14.620 --> 10:16.850
...of a totally unknown person's life.

10:17.020 --> 10:21.536
I'm only charging $37.50, plus you get
a pizza bagel and dessert.

10:21.700 --> 10:24.817
- What's dessert?
- Bite-size 3 Musketeers.

10:25.300 --> 10:26.972
Just like the real Peterman eats.

10:27.140 --> 10:30.098
- He eats those?
- No, I eat those.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.132
I'm the real Peterman.

10:32.540 --> 10:33.814
- I don't...
- Wait a minute.

10:34.180 --> 10:36.171
I think I understand this.

10:36.380 --> 10:39.178
J. Peterman is real.
His biography is not.

10:39.340 --> 10:41.217
Now, you, Kramer, are real.

10:41.380 --> 10:44.258
- Talk to me.
- But your life is Peterman's.

10:44.420 --> 10:46.695
Now, the bus tour, which is real...

10:46.860 --> 10:49.055
...takes you to places that,
while they are real...

10:49.220 --> 10:52.178
...they are not real in the sense
that they did not really happen...

10:52.340 --> 10:54.296
...to the real Peterman, which is you.

10:55.660 --> 10:59.016
- Understand?
- Yeah, it's 37.50 for a 3 Musketeers.

11:03.060 --> 11:07.292
Elaine, I'm in over my head.
Nobody likes my muffin tops.

11:07.460 --> 11:09.371
So? What do you want
me to do about it?

11:09.540 --> 11:12.259
You're the muffin-top expert.
Tell me what I'm doing wrong.

11:12.420 --> 11:15.571
Mr. Lippman, when I worked for you
at Pendant Publishing...

11:15.740 --> 11:19.050
...I believed in you, you know,
as a man of integrity.

11:19.220 --> 11:23.975
But when I saw you
in that paper hat and that apron...

11:24.140 --> 11:26.370
What if I cut you in
for 30 percent of the profits?

11:26.540 --> 11:28.656
Deal. Here's your problem:

11:29.740 --> 11:32.459
You're making just the muffin tops.

11:32.620 --> 11:36.215
- What do you mean?
- You gotta make the whole muffin.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.974
Then you...

11:40.940 --> 11:43.579
...pop the top, toss the stump.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.654
Taste.

11:51.020 --> 11:53.898
- So, what do we do with the bottoms?
- Give them to a soup kitchen.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.130
- It's a good idea.
- And one more thing.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.450
Do you really think
we need the exclamation point?

11:58.620 --> 12:02.852
Because it's not,
"Top of the muffin to you!"

12:03.020 --> 12:04.453
No, no, it is.

12:08.020 --> 12:11.012
Hey, Jerry. What's this?

12:11.660 --> 12:13.890
Lady Gillette?

12:14.060 --> 12:16.528
Oh, what's going on?

12:16.980 --> 12:18.254
- Hey.
- What?

12:18.420 --> 12:20.809
- Jeez.
- Can't I get a moment's peace?

12:20.980 --> 12:25.098
- What are you doing to yourself?
- I can't stop.

12:25.860 --> 12:29.614
- Alex thinks I'm naturally hairless.
- What? You can't keep this up.

12:29.780 --> 12:31.293
Don't you know
what's gonna happen?

12:31.460 --> 12:35.135
Every time you shave it, it's gonna
come in thicker and fuller and darker.

12:35.300 --> 12:39.498
- Oh, that's an old wives' tale.
- Is it? Look at this.

12:40.300 --> 12:44.896
- What is...? What is that?
- Look at it! Look at it!

12:46.820 --> 12:49.857
It's all me.
I shaved there when I was a lifeguard.

12:50.380 --> 12:54.055
Oh, come on. That's genetic.
That's not gonna happen to me.

12:54.220 --> 12:58.179
Won't it?
Or has it already started to happen?

13:00.340 --> 13:02.012
Look at this, we're cleaning up.

13:02.180 --> 13:05.092
Oh, Reuben, get me another tray
of low-fat cranberry, please.

13:06.420 --> 13:09.935
Excuse me. I'm Rebecca DeMornay,
from the homeless shelter.

13:10.100 --> 13:12.614
- Oh, hi.
- Are you the ones...

13:12.780 --> 13:14.930
...leaving those muffin pieces
behind our shelter?

13:15.100 --> 13:17.739
- You've been enjoying them?
- They're just stumps.

13:18.900 --> 13:21.494
- Well, they're perfectly edible.
- Oh, so you just assume...

13:21.660 --> 13:23.935
...the homeless will eat them?
They'll eat anything?

13:24.100 --> 13:26.170
- No, we just thought...
- I know what you thought:

13:26.340 --> 13:28.058
"They don't have homes.
Don't have jobs.

13:28.220 --> 13:31.496
What do they need the top of a muffin
for? They're lucky to get stumps."

13:31.660 --> 13:35.016
If the homeless don't like them,
the homeless don't have to eat them.

13:35.180 --> 13:37.978
The homeless don't like them.
We've never had so many complaints.

13:38.140 --> 13:40.335
Every two minutes:
"Where's the top of this muffin?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.650
- Who ate the rest?"
- We were just trying to help.

13:42.820 --> 13:45.254
Why don't you drop off
chicken skins and lobster shells?

13:45.420 --> 13:47.012
I think I might.

13:47.220 --> 13:49.415
I can't believe
you found something so quickly.

13:49.580 --> 13:51.810
- How much are you paying?
- Twenty-three hundred.

13:51.980 --> 13:54.653
- Ouch, a month?
- Yeah.

13:55.420 --> 13:57.172
Well, I guess that's all right for now.

13:57.340 --> 14:00.616
But if you stay here more than
a few months, you're a real sucker.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.412
Yeah, well, I... I got lots
of other stuff to show you too.

14:05.580 --> 14:07.889
Wait till you see
the plum job that I landed.

14:08.260 --> 14:10.979
Yeah, we should let this place
air out anyway.

14:11.140 --> 14:14.212
It smells like the last tenant
had monkeys or something.

14:19.620 --> 14:20.973
Okay, coming up on the right...

14:21.140 --> 14:23.700
...if you glance up, you'll just make out
my bedroom window.

14:23.860 --> 14:25.737
It's the one
that's covered in chicken wire.

14:25.900 --> 14:28.289
Hey, if you're the real Peterman...

14:28.460 --> 14:30.815
...how come you're wearing
those ratty clothes?

14:31.180 --> 14:34.809
- What?
- Well, they're not very romantic.

14:34.980 --> 14:36.254
Well, that's your opinion.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.457
Can I have another 3 Musketeers?
They're rather small.

14:39.620 --> 14:40.894
Forget it.

14:41.060 --> 14:43.335
Okay, Newman's postal route
is around here somewhere.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.092
- Who's Newman?
- Who cares?

14:45.260 --> 14:48.093
Hey, fake Peterman, let me off.
I'm nauseous.

14:48.260 --> 14:49.534
Can I have his candy bar?

14:49.980 --> 14:51.936
Everyone just settle down.

14:52.180 --> 14:54.136
Okay, we got three hours left
on this thing...

14:54.300 --> 14:57.736
...and I can't drive and argue
with you rubes all at the same time.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.970
Okay, Lomez's place of worship
is right on the right here.

15:04.500 --> 15:07.810
- Why do I have to go on the tour?
- Jerry, you're a minor celebrity.

15:07.980 --> 15:10.733
You know, if you go on this thing,
it could create a minor stir.

15:10.900 --> 15:14.813
You bring that little girlfriend of yours
and I'll only charge you 60 bucks.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.732
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:16.900 --> 15:19.733
- How's business?
- Oh, I got stump trouble.

15:19.900 --> 15:22.130
The sanitation department
won't get rid of them all.

15:22.300 --> 15:24.894
I can't get a truck to haul this stuff
until next week.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.494
Meanwhile, I'm sitting
on a mountain of stumps.

15:29.100 --> 15:30.374
All right.

15:30.540 --> 15:33.418
I gotta hose the puke
off the floor of the bus.

15:33.580 --> 15:36.378
Bus? Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Bus? You got a bus?

15:36.540 --> 15:38.132
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Any room on that thing?

15:38.300 --> 15:40.052
There are a few seats still available.

15:40.260 --> 15:43.570
Do you think you could
transport some stumps for me?

15:43.740 --> 15:45.571
I'll make it worth your while.

15:45.740 --> 15:48.379
Well, if they don't mind
sitting in the back.

15:49.420 --> 15:50.978
No, they don't.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.058
Are they war veterans?

15:58.060 --> 15:59.812
This is your office?

15:59.980 --> 16:01.777
Oh, hello. Sorry, George...

16:01.940 --> 16:05.057
...didn't know you had a girl in here.
Leave a signal on the doorknob...

16:05.220 --> 16:07.688
...like a necktie or a sock or something.
Help me out.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.055
Mr. Steinbrenner,
I would like to thank you...

16:10.220 --> 16:12.893
...for taking a chance
on a hen supervisor at Tyler Chicken...

16:13.060 --> 16:16.575
...like our boy George here.
- Hen supervisor from Tyler Chicken?

16:16.740 --> 16:18.810
Yes, very nice for her
to have met you, sir.

16:18.980 --> 16:20.254
Wait a minute, George.

16:20.420 --> 16:23.173
Be right with you.
Look, Mr. Steinbrenner...

16:23.340 --> 16:25.774
Moonlighting for Tyler Chicken.
Impressive, George.

16:25.940 --> 16:27.658
Days with Yankees,
nights in Arkansas...

16:27.820 --> 16:31.096
...with a topflight bird outfit.
And a hen supervisor, to boot.

16:31.260 --> 16:34.650
I am blown. Blown away.

16:34.820 --> 16:39.177
Blown, George. Blown!

16:41.380 --> 16:43.098
You know,
when you make a pizza bagel...

16:43.260 --> 16:46.013
...you really shouldn't
use cinnamon raisin.

16:46.180 --> 16:49.092
You also shouldn't use a doughnut.

16:55.340 --> 16:58.377
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Peterman Reality Tour.

16:58.540 --> 17:00.132
Turn music off.

17:00.300 --> 17:03.497
- Kramer, can we just go?
- And go we will.

17:03.660 --> 17:05.570
What is this? Pizza pound cake?

17:05.740 --> 17:07.731
Well, we have a bonus
ultra-reality stop today.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.654
We're gonna be hauling muffin stumps
to the local repository.

17:11.819 --> 17:14.936
- We're going to a garbage dump?
- And we're off.

17:16.619 --> 17:19.612
You know, I never thought he'd
be able to re-create the experience...

17:19.780 --> 17:22.499
...of actually knowing him,
but this is pretty close.

17:25.700 --> 17:29.375
Don Tyler? George Steinbrenner here.
I wanna talk about George Costanza.

17:29.540 --> 17:32.100
I understand he's been
dividing his time between us and you.

17:32.260 --> 17:34.535
- I cannot have that.
- Well, I don't know who he is...

17:34.700 --> 17:37.260
...but if you want him that bad,
I'm not giving up easy.

17:37.420 --> 17:40.059
Oh, is that so? Playing a little
hardball, huh, Donny boy?

17:40.220 --> 17:42.734
How about this:
You give me Costanza.

17:42.900 --> 17:45.892
I convert your concessions
to all chicken, no charge.

17:46.060 --> 17:49.257
Instead of hot dogs, chicken dogs.
Instead of pretzels, chicken twists.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.695
Instead of beer, alcoholic chicken.

17:51.900 --> 17:55.256
- How do you make alcoholic chicken?
- They ferment, just like anything else.

17:55.420 --> 17:59.538
That stuff sounds great. All right,
I'll have Costanza on the next bus.

18:02.700 --> 18:05.260
Hey, hey, hey.
Where do you think you're going?

18:05.420 --> 18:08.617
- Well, I was gonna dump this.
- It doesn't look like garbage.

18:08.780 --> 18:11.772
- Well, it's muffin stumps.
- Where are the muffin tops?

18:11.940 --> 18:14.374
This is a garbage dump.
Just let me dump it.

18:14.580 --> 18:16.172
Can't do it.

18:16.340 --> 18:20.891
- Is this a joke?
- That's what I like to know about it.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.294
You have a pretty heavy beard,
don't you?

18:25.460 --> 18:28.657
- What's that?
- Look, it's almost time for you to shave.

18:28.860 --> 18:32.091
Oh, yeah.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.936
Well, maybe I will take it up
with Consumer Affairs!

18:39.780 --> 18:42.419
Well, ladies and gentlemen,
you're in for an additional treat.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.174
We're going to extend the tour
at no extra charge.

18:45.340 --> 18:47.331
- Where are we going?
- I don't know.

18:47.500 --> 18:49.411
No more questions.

19:10.100 --> 19:15.015
So the New York Yankees traded you
for a bunch of Tyler Chicken?

19:15.180 --> 19:20.538
Dogs, twists,
and a fermented chicken drink.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.218
Hey, aren't you the guy
I asked to watch my clothes?

19:24.460 --> 19:25.813
- What clothes?
- These clothes.

19:25.980 --> 19:27.891
The ones you're wearing.

19:32.540 --> 19:33.893
- Kramer, how much longer?
- What?

19:34.060 --> 19:36.699
My chest hair's growing back,
and it's itching me like crazy.

19:36.860 --> 19:39.249
- I can't let her see me scratch it.
- Well, don't worry.

19:39.420 --> 19:43.652
- I got a good feeling about this dump.
- I tell you, man, I'm losing it.

19:52.700 --> 19:55.260
I can't sit on this bus anymore.

19:55.420 --> 19:57.809
I think I'll go play with that dog.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.732
I don't know where the tops are.

20:07.100 --> 20:09.375
Jerry, what's the matter?

20:26.460 --> 20:28.451
That feels good.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.575
- Oh, hey, you looking for George?
- Yes.

20:37.740 --> 20:41.130
He's been in the bathroom a while.
You might wanna check on him.

20:42.180 --> 20:44.057
Jerry, you gotta bring me
some clothes here.

20:44.220 --> 20:45.573
I lost my job with the Yankees.

20:45.740 --> 20:48.413
I'm standing in a men's room
on 43rd Street in my underpants.

20:48.580 --> 20:51.936
I told you
this city would eat you alive.

20:54.380 --> 20:57.053
And I think my relationship's
in trouble.

20:59.820 --> 21:02.698
- What is this guy again?
- They call him a cleaner.

21:02.860 --> 21:05.420
He makes problems go away.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.451
- Hello, Elaine.
- Where did you get the car?

21:24.620 --> 21:26.212
It's a rental.

21:27.140 --> 21:29.415
- Where are they?
- In the back.

21:30.220 --> 21:33.098
All right. I'm gonna need
a clean eight-ounce glass.

21:33.260 --> 21:38.175
- What is going on here?
- lf I'm curt, then I apologize.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.769
But as I understand it,
we have a situation here.

21:40.940 --> 21:43.135
And time is of the essence.
