{\an8}I'm thinking
a quick snack

01:00.226 --> 01:02.812
{\an7}maybe something in the way
of a Sloppy Jane...

01:02.896 --> 01:03.813
{\an8}Light on the slop,
extra Jane.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.648
{\an7}...then pedicures
and homework.

01:05.732 --> 01:07.734
{\an8}How's that sound?

01:07.817 --> 01:10.195
{\an8}Pedicures!
Dibs on Ginger!

Same as always?

I call frontsies!

01:18.745 --> 01:21.164
{\an8}Hmm...

01:21.247 --> 01:22.457
{\an8}Anything interesting?

01:22.540 --> 01:23.666
{\an8}What's a "frontsie,"
Miranda?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.795
{\an7}I'm not sure, but I can get
on the Internet and find out.

01:26.878 --> 01:30.173
No, that won't be necessary.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.634
I intend to see for myself.

01:32.717 --> 01:37.222
I really think this color is
going to work for you, Ginger.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.848
It's called "Popular in Peach."

01:38.932 --> 01:41.851
Courtney Gripling
wore it on her nails

01:41.935 --> 01:43.311
{\an5}the entire final
marking period
last semester.

01:43.394 --> 01:47.816
Everything, just everything,
looks good on Courtney Gripling.

01:48.650 --> 01:50.485
Well? What do you think?

01:50.568 --> 01:52.695

Careful with the cuticles,
Miranda!

Uh... remind me why we
didn't go to the salon

02:01.663 --> 02:02.705
like we usually do?

02:02.789 --> 02:06.042
Friends paint their
friends' toenails, Miranda.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.043
It's as simple as frontsies.

02:07.126 --> 02:10.045
We need to finalize
the guest list

02:10.128 --> 02:13.716

the invitations for
your surprise party.

{\an4}Miranda:
Uh, I'm sorry, I don't think
I heard you correctly...

02:32.110 --> 02:34.904
{\an1}Did you say
Ginger Foutley?

02:34.988 --> 02:38.074
I said out,
you scum-coated pond creature!

02:38.157 --> 02:40.702
(<i> whirring</i> )

02:40.785 --> 02:41.828
Ginger Foutley,
that's right.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.831
But she's a total wannabe!

02:44.914 --> 02:47.000
Still, there's
something about her.

02:47.083 --> 02:50.044
{\an1}There's nothing
about her, Courtney!

02:50.128 --> 02:52.964
{\an1}Her presence will force
the party's chemistry

02:53.047 --> 02:54.591
into a downward spiral!

02:54.674 --> 02:57.051
Let's move on.

02:57.135 --> 03:02.181
{\an5}Okay. It's really important
that my face express total
and complete surprise

03:02.265 --> 03:05.143
while still looking
really, really hot.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.520
Now, I'm thinking
something like this...

(<i> clears throat</i> )

03:08.563 --> 03:09.898
Oh, my gosh!

03:09.981 --> 03:12.734
Oh, What a total
and complete surprise!

03:12.817 --> 03:16.362
{\an1}If you ask me,
it felt a little... phony.

03:16.446 --> 03:19.574
{\an1}Miranda on tape:
Did you say Ginger Foutley?

03:19.657 --> 03:20.283

03:22.118 --> 03:24.621
Ginger Foutley,
that's right.

you get our frequency?

04:03.701 --> 04:04.994
Hello there, Carl.

for the tip.

the time for blackmail

04:26.224 --> 04:30.645
{\an5}is <i> before</i> you've dispensed
the valuable information,
not afterwards!

Macie a heart attack!

resist the smell

your hands.

07:22.775 --> 07:27.405
to Courtney Gripling's
birthday party?

07:27.488 --> 07:28.614
(<i> snickers</i> )

07:28.698 --> 07:32.076
You must be very pleased
with yourself.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.870
Yeah. It's, uh, pretty cool.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.037
It's very cool.

07:35.121 --> 07:37.290
Very cool indeed.

07:37.373 --> 07:40.751
{\an1}Things are really
moving along for you, Ginger.

07:40.835 --> 07:44.714
{\an1}And don't worry, there's
nothing to be nervous about.

07:44.797 --> 07:48.342
{\an1}Except for maybe...
what to get Courtney as a gift.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.677
{\an1}I mean...

07:49.760 --> 07:52.555
{\an1}the girl has everything
and still expects the best.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.182
But you'll think
of something.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.349
You better.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.893
Because in this town

07:56.976 --> 07:59.729
you're only as good
as your last gift.

07:59.812 --> 08:00.771
Remember that.

08:00.855 --> 08:02.940
Whoa!

08:03.024 --> 08:04.066
Whoopsie.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.319
What are you doing here?

08:06.402 --> 08:07.987
We have a hall pass...

08:08.070 --> 08:10.656
(<i> snickers</i> )

08:10.740 --> 08:12.200
Please...

08:13.075 --> 08:14.744
Great! I didn't even
think of that!

08:14.827 --> 08:19.040
I finally get invited
to one of Courtney's parties

08:19.123 --> 08:21.375
and now I'm going to
have to show up

08:21.459 --> 08:23.586
with some crummy
old present.

08:23.669 --> 08:24.837
Same as always.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.256
I like your crummy
old presents, Ginger!

08:27.340 --> 08:31.177
{\an5}Who could forget that nifty
pocket tic-tac-toe pad
you made last Christmas?

08:31.260 --> 08:33.888
No, Macie, Ginger's right.

08:33.971 --> 08:34.847
This is big time.

08:34.931 --> 08:38.517
{\an1}Some lame-o gift
like hand-painted barrettes

08:38.601 --> 08:40.602
isn't going to help her now.

08:40.686 --> 08:44.106
{\an1}Even though I really like
those ones you made me.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.234
I'm dead meat.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.877
Now, the perfect viewing spot
for Courtney's party

09:04.961 --> 09:06.462
is Blake's tree house, right?

09:06.545 --> 09:07.338
Hoodsey:
Right...

09:07.421 --> 09:08.589
And if we get exclusive photos

09:08.673 --> 09:11.759
the blackmail possibilities
are endless, right?

09:11.842 --> 09:13.970
Right...

09:14.053 --> 09:16.305
So all we have to do
is lure Blake away

09:16.389 --> 09:19.141
so we can snap photos
and reap the riches! Right?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.518
Carl! I can't go

09:20.601 --> 09:23.479
when you keep
talking to me, okay?

09:23.562 --> 09:26.232
Okay, relax, Hoodsey.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
(<i> toilet flushing</i> )

09:36.784 --> 09:38.327
Did you bring
the curling iron?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.413
Some of my ringlets
are coming loose.

09:40.496 --> 09:42.123
Foutley! How much
for a curly hairdo?

09:42.206 --> 09:44.875
Not selling today, Walker.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.170
Hey, let's go be nice
to Blake Gripling.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.256
It's almost 3:00 and
I'll bet you anything

09:50.339 --> 09:51.966
he's in
the small playground.

a very unusual situation

09:58.431 --> 10:01.767
and it needs to be
handled delicately.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.729
{\an5}You played
like my grandma
today, Patterson!

10:04.812 --> 10:06.522
You're dead meat
tomorrow!

10:06.605 --> 10:07.940
Count on it!

10:08.024 --> 10:09.191
Okay, sounds good!

10:09.275 --> 10:11.152
See you tomorrow, Vince!

10:11.235 --> 10:13.863
I'll call...

10:13.946 --> 10:15.406
{\an1}Well, you could
give Courtney an I.O.U.

10:15.489 --> 10:18.409
{\an1}until you think
of something good.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.285
Maybe I should
just stay home

10:19.368 --> 10:22.246
and save myself
the humiliation.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.540
{\an1}Miranda:
Or you could let me save you.

10:24.623 --> 10:27.626
I've been thinking
about your dilemma,<i> Ginger</i>

10:27.710 --> 10:28.210
and I feel your pain.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.796
I may have the solution.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.715
I know something Courtney
really wants

10:32.798 --> 10:37.136
it's totally original
and it doesn't cost a dime.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.140
Macie:
Of course!

10:41.223 --> 10:44.852
An interest-yielding IRA account
linked with free checking!

10:44.935 --> 10:46.729
It's what every girl wants...

10:46.812 --> 10:48.064
on the inside.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.273
(<i> exasperated sigh</i> )

10:49.357 --> 10:51.192
{\an1}The "Enter" sign,
Ginger.

10:51.275 --> 10:53.235
{\an1}For outside
Courtney's bedroom.

10:53.319 --> 10:53.903
She'll flip!

10:53.986 --> 10:55.363
Uh, I don't know,
Miranda...

10:55.446 --> 10:58.824
{\an1}It's practically
falling off anyway.

10:58.908 --> 11:02.411
{\an1}I mean, all you have to do
is just... pluck it.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.955
Isn't that...
uh, stealing?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.540
I prefer to think of it

11:06.624 --> 11:10.252
as "borrowing without asking
and no intention to return."

11:10.336 --> 11:12.671
{\an1}Ginger could get
in big trouble, Miranda.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.881
Excuse me.

11:13.964 --> 11:16.258
I thought Ginger
already was in big trouble.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.511
If you're too chicken
to go through with it

11:18.594 --> 11:19.595
let me know, Ginger.

11:19.678 --> 11:20.638
There's plenty
of other kids

11:20.721 --> 11:24.016
{\an5}who would
turn cartwheels
for the tip.

11:24.100 --> 11:27.103
{\an5}You have until
the stroke of
4:15 to decide.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.771
That's when I get home

11:28.854 --> 11:30.147
from clarinet.

11:35.194 --> 11:38.614
(<i> laughing</i> )

11:38.697 --> 11:39.573
Look at him.

11:39.657 --> 11:40.282
{\an1}School's been out
for an hour

11:40.366 --> 11:41.700
and he isn't even dirty.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.581
(<i> humming</i> )

11:47.665 --> 11:49.166
Hello, Blake.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.168
(<i> gasps</i> )

11:51.252 --> 11:52.795
Carl!

11:52.878 --> 11:54.046
Woodsy.

11:54.130 --> 11:55.965
It's <i> Hoodsey,</i> Blake--
with an "H".

11:56.048 --> 11:58.467
{\an1}Lately, we've been
thinking about things...

11:58.551 --> 12:00.302
and we came to the conclusion

12:00.386 --> 12:02.888
that maybe it's time
the three of us played.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.765
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.142
{\an1}Would I!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.353
{\an1}I mean...
an intriguing idea.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.897
Then be at my doghouse
tomorrow evening.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.732
I'm afraid
I shall have to decline.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.029
You see, that conflicts
with my sister's birthday party

12:19.113 --> 12:23.868
and I'm bent set on stirring up
a bit of mischief, as it were.

12:23.951 --> 12:24.869
Sorry to hear that, Blake.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.497
Hoodsey and I don't
bode well with rejection

12:28.581 --> 12:32.501
and an offer like this comes
along but once in a blue moon...

12:32.585 --> 12:36.797
{\an1}Uh, I wonder...
perhaps we can reschedule?

12:36.881 --> 12:37.756
No, sorry.

12:37.840 --> 12:39.216
We're booked solid.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.676
Let's go, Hoods.

12:40.759 --> 12:42.178
Bye, Blake.

12:42.261 --> 12:43.804
Bye...

12:43.888 --> 12:46.599
{\an1}Great! What are we
going to do now?

12:46.682 --> 12:49.685
We're going to sit
and wait,<i> Woodsy.</i>

12:49.768 --> 12:52.062
We're going to
sit and wait.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.317
Steal the sign,
risk going to prison.

12:56.400 --> 12:59.236
Show up with a lame gift

12:59.320 --> 13:03.115
ruin chances of being
invited to another party

13:03.199 --> 13:05.201
and life <i> becomes</i> a prison.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.077
What's worse?

13:07.161 --> 13:09.330
Well, in real prison...

13:09.413 --> 13:10.498
you get to sleep on bunk beds.

13:10.581 --> 13:13.834
I guess bunk beds
are kind of cool.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.588
So you're saying
I should steal the sign?

13:17.671 --> 13:19.215
{\an1}No, no, hey,
I'm just saying

13:19.298 --> 13:21.008
{\an1}that bunk beds
are kind of cool.

13:21.091 --> 13:23.010
Yeah...
yeah, you're right.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.762
Yeah, especially the top bunks.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.555
Uh... not about
the bunk beds, Darren.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.058
I have to steal the sign.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.478
{\an1}I mean, I want to give
Courtney a good present...

13:32.561 --> 13:34.396
I want to show Miranda
I'm not chicken...

13:34.480 --> 13:35.773
and I hate to say it

13:35.856 --> 13:39.735
but I kind of want those
kids to think I'm cool.

13:39.818 --> 13:43.948
Do you think that's
totally uncool?

13:46.700 --> 13:47.076
Crackle, darn you!

13:47.159 --> 13:49.036
{\an3}Crackle!

13:49.119 --> 13:50.329
It's no use, Carl!

13:50.412 --> 13:52.122
He's never going to..

13:52.206 --> 13:53.624
(<i> static crackling</i> )

13:53.707 --> 13:55.501
Blake Gripling to Carl!

13:55.584 --> 13:57.294
Come in, Carl!

13:57.378 --> 13:59.547
Both:
Yes!

14:00.172 --> 14:02.967
I despise the clarinet!

14:03.509 --> 14:05.761
Almost as much as...

14:05.844 --> 14:09.139
(<i> phone rings</i> )

14:09.223 --> 14:10.140
(<i> snickers</i> )

14:10.224 --> 14:12.226
You rang?

14:12.309 --> 14:13.394
Why, Ginger!

14:13.477 --> 14:15.980
I was just thinking about you.

14:16.063 --> 14:19.441
Uh, about that little
suggestion you made...

14:19.525 --> 14:20.776
Yeah?

14:20.859 --> 14:23.362
I'm going to do it.

14:23.445 --> 14:24.989
(<i> snickers</i> )

14:25.072 --> 14:26.574
Excellent decision, Ginger.

14:26.657 --> 14:30.119
I'm sure you won't regret it.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.955
(<i> laughing...</i> )

14:39.295 --> 14:42.798
{\an5}Courtney:
What a total and
complete surprise!

14:42.881 --> 14:44.008
(<i> laughing</i> )

14:44.091 --> 14:45.968
Oh, for me?

14:46.051 --> 14:49.597
What a lovely surprise!

14:49.680 --> 14:50.723
Is the receipt in the box?

14:50.806 --> 14:54.101
Yep. Tonight's the big night!

14:54.184 --> 14:59.148
Carl, Woodsy and an up-close
look at that precious eyeball.

14:59.231 --> 15:04.945
Not bad, for the tender age
of seven and three-quarters.

15:09.033 --> 15:09.867
Bye, Mom!

15:09.950 --> 15:10.492
See you late tonight!

15:10.576 --> 15:13.370
Meatloaf's in the 'fridge!

15:13.454 --> 15:15.331
Thaw it before eating, okay?

15:15.414 --> 15:19.835
{\an4}And remind your brother
he's still grounded
from last weekend.

15:19.918 --> 15:20.836
I will! Bye!

15:20.919 --> 15:22.296
There isn't much time.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.589
Let's raid Carl's room.

15:23.672 --> 15:25.674
We're going to need disguises.

15:25.758 --> 15:28.010
{\an1}Are you sure you want to
go through with this?

15:28.093 --> 15:29.428
There's no backing out
now, Macie.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.597
I already said.

15:33.974 --> 15:35.517
We're going to have to
pick the lock.

15:35.601 --> 15:37.561
Sure, yeah, why not?

15:37.645 --> 15:38.854
Breaking and entering

15:38.937 --> 15:41.148
stealing from
a federal institution...

15:41.231 --> 15:43.317
{\an1}Look, I break into my
brother's room all the time.

15:43.400 --> 15:46.987
{\an1}Why don't you guys stand back
and observe the master at work?

15:56.455 --> 15:57.373
(<i> alarm blaring</i> )

15:57.456 --> 16:00.334
Carl as alarm voice:
Intruder! Intruder!

16:00.417 --> 16:01.460
You are being pelted

16:01.543 --> 16:04.213
with pre-chewed
Super Double Berry Bubble!

16:04.296 --> 16:06.548
This will not come out!

16:06.632 --> 16:08.175
Intruder! Int...

16:09.843 --> 16:10.219
{\an3}Darren:
Jackpot!

16:10.302 --> 16:12.137
{\an3}Look!

16:13.305 --> 16:15.057
Way to go, Darren!

16:18.977 --> 16:21.146
Let's do this thing!

16:21.230 --> 16:23.315
{\an1}Macie!

16:23.399 --> 16:26.276
Sorry. Must be the
adrenaline talking.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.000
{\an1}Give it to me straight,
Winston.

16:42.084 --> 16:44.503
{\an1}Do I look cool enough
to play with?

16:44.586 --> 16:48.215
{\an1}You're all that and a bag
of fish and chips, sir.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.276
Aah!

17:08.902 --> 17:11.029
Double-crossers!

17:13.574 --> 17:14.992
(<i> dialing cell phone</i> )

17:15.075 --> 17:16.117
Hello, Winston?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.412
There's been
a bit of tomfoolery.

17:18.494 --> 17:20.497
I need you back here at once.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.833
{\an1}Mmm! He's got
Malted Milk Monkeys!

17:22.915 --> 17:24.667
Okay. Let's get
down to business.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.337
Where's the
lighting equipment?

17:27.421 --> 17:29.339

Mmph mm knpsck!

Just a minute, Courtney.

I've got one quick phone call
to make...

17:50.402 --> 17:51.028
(<i> dialing cell phone</i> )

17:51.111 --> 17:54.072
Officer Killgallen, please!

17:54.156 --> 17:55.657
Hello, Daddy?

17:55.741 --> 17:58.076
I'd like to report
a robbery in progress...

18:05.584 --> 18:06.502
What's she
waiting for?

18:06.585 --> 18:07.169
I don't know.

18:07.252 --> 18:08.837
I, I guess
she's nervous.

18:08.921 --> 18:09.838
I'm not nervous!

18:09.922 --> 18:11.006
{\an1}I'm soaking up
this powerful moment

18:11.089 --> 18:13.801
{\an1}whereby I take matters
into my own hands and...

18:13.884 --> 18:16.553
{\an1}you know,
risk going to prison.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.305
(<i> takes a deep breath</i> )

18:18.388 --> 18:19.556
Okay... I'm going to do it.

All right.

Okay, count of three.

home, sir.

the play date I came here for

19:08.647 --> 19:11.275

leave empty-handed.

19:11.358 --> 19:11.817
Sir?

19:11.900 --> 19:14.570
Payback has a name.

19:14.653 --> 19:17.072
It starts with "petrified"

19:17.155 --> 19:20.033
and it ends with "eyeball."

Will this go

19:31.753 --> 19:35.757
{\an1}Um, exactly how much hard time
do you think I'll serve?

19:35.841 --> 19:38.594
Well, you're looking
at a minimum sentence

19:38.677 --> 19:40.596
of probation,
community service

19:40.679 --> 19:44.600
{\an5}and a whopping grounding
from your mama...
if it's up to me.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.436

<i>please</i> explain to me

20:52.793 --> 20:57.798
{\an1}how even when Ginger Foutley
loses... she wins?!

20:59.967 --> 21:03.845
(<i> door opening</i> )

21:03.929 --> 21:06.056
(<i> panting</i> )

21:06.139 --> 21:07.099
{\an1}Both:
Ginger's been arrested!

21:07.182 --> 21:10.435
I don't care what
cockamamie excuse...

21:10.519 --> 21:10.894
What did you say?

21:10.978 --> 21:12.854
It's true, Mom!

21:12.938 --> 21:13.814
{\an1}She was arrested
for robbing a bank!

21:13.897 --> 21:18.610
(<i> phone ringing</i> )

21:18.694 --> 21:20.737
{\an1}Hello?

21:20.821 --> 21:22.322
{\an1}I see.

21:22.406 --> 21:23.699
I'm on my way.

21:23.782 --> 21:26.118
Told you so!

21:27.327 --> 21:29.204
Uh, Mom, if Ginger
goes to prison...

21:29.288 --> 21:30.914
can Hoodsey move
into her room?

21:30.998 --> 21:31.331
Get your coat!

21:34.835 --> 21:35.794
(<i> gasps</i> )

21:35.877 --> 21:36.920
Oh!

21:37.004 --> 21:38.797
Filthy, filthy, filthy.

21:38.880 --> 21:42.843
{\an5}I'll have
the cleaning crew
up in the morning, sir.

21:42.926 --> 21:46.054
A real victory
for the little guy, sir.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.098
Where would
you like it?

21:48.181 --> 21:49.474
Top shelf, please.

21:55.522 --> 22:02.404
Something tells me we shall
meet again, Mr. Foutley.

22:02.487 --> 22:04.031
<i>Carl's picture proved</i>
<i>it was Miranda</i>

22:04.114 --> 22:06.575
<i>who tipped off the police.</i>

22:06.658 --> 22:07.993
<i>I still can't believe</i>
<i>I fell for her plan.</i>

22:08.076 --> 22:10.579
<i>I mean, what was I thinking...</i>

22:10.662 --> 22:13.415
<i>risking everything</i>
<i>just for some stupid present?</i>

22:13.498 --> 22:14.291
<i>And as for the next few months?</i>

22:14.374 --> 22:17.044
<i>Well, I guess</i>
<i>my social calendar</i>

22:17.127 --> 22:19.796
<i>will have to take a back seat</i>
<i>to community service.</i>

22:19.880 --> 22:20.422
<i>What a bummer.</i>

22:24.718 --> 22:27.721
<i>No one ever said</i>
<i>a life of crime was glamorous.</i>

22:30.265 --> 22:32.267
Dodie:
Hi, Ginger, it's me.

22:32.350 --> 22:34.227
I'm grounded for a month

22:34.311 --> 22:35.854
{\an1}and Macie
is hyperventilating

22:35.937 --> 22:36.897
{\an1}but I just
wanted you to know

22:36.980 --> 22:39.691
{\an1}that absolutely <i> everyone</i>
is talking about you!

22:39.775 --> 22:41.485
{\an1}The entire middle school?
In a tizzy!

22:41.568 --> 22:44.780
{\an1}If you get this message, you
must, must,<i> must</i> call me back!

22:44.863 --> 22:46.448
Too bad I'm not allowed
to use the phone.
