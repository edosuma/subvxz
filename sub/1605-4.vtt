01:31.241 --> 01:34.626
And now what? You wipe it up,
but that does not disinfect.

01:34.746 --> 01:36.164
How are you going to disinfect?

01:36.246 --> 01:37.874
(WHISPERING) I don't know.
I've never cleaned up

01:37.999 --> 01:39.625
another person's pee before.

01:39.751 --> 01:41.711
Quite a privileged
life you've led!

01:41.794 --> 01:45.255
Yeah, well, now...
Now I'm here.

01:45.381 --> 01:48.176
I have to be up in three hours.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.136
I ought to knock
you into Tuesday

01:50.220 --> 01:52.430
for bringing that
baggage to my house!

01:52.931 --> 01:56.851
Like I asked for this?
I don't want this.

01:56.935 --> 01:58.603
I don't know what to do.

01:58.728 --> 02:00.939
About what?
You clean the piss!

02:01.189 --> 02:03.942
The piss,
the stalker, your anger,

02:05.068 --> 02:08.613
my cluelessness, disinfectant.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.448
There is another
person's pee on me,

02:10.531 --> 02:13.952
and I'm not allowed to use the
bathroom until the morning.

02:14.953 --> 02:17.080
I have to sleep with
stranger pee on me.

02:17.288 --> 02:22.334
Oh, Coo-coo. It's hard for you.
Little girl lost.

02:23.628 --> 02:25.296
Claudette, you push the button.

02:30.593 --> 02:32.929
It's called an elevator.

02:33.679 --> 02:34.806
Don't be scared.

02:35.974 --> 02:37.142
C'mon.

02:40.853 --> 02:43.314
It's a magic flying box.

02:45.817 --> 02:46.818
Step in.

02:48.820 --> 02:49.946
Come.

02:52.282 --> 02:55.660
TESSA: Dee! Where's Dee?
Get over here, child.

02:57.912 --> 03:01.207
Dee, take off that uniform,
put an iron to it,

03:01.331 --> 03:03.333
and if you're not ready
to go in five minutes,

03:03.459 --> 03:06.921
I'm sending you back
on the next boat! Go!

03:07.005 --> 03:09.715
Baptiste, close the door, you're
letting all the heat out.

03:11.341 --> 03:12.844
Get in here.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.638
Who's this one?

03:16.055 --> 03:18.016
This is Claudette.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.351
Look at this skinny cat.

03:21.477 --> 03:23.688
Open your mouth. How are
your teeth, skinny cat?

03:23.771 --> 03:24.772
(SPEAKING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE)

03:24.856 --> 03:26.983
I want to go home.

03:27.483 --> 03:31.321
This is your home now. And you
will only speak English here.

03:31.403 --> 03:34.240
Understand? Let me hear.

03:34.615 --> 03:36.366
Yes, understanding.

03:36.492 --> 03:37.493
Mmm.

03:37.576 --> 03:39.369
Go in the back and get changed.

03:39.495 --> 03:43.333
Uniforms are on the shelf in the hall.
Go on! There's work to do.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.667
Work?

03:44.876 --> 03:50.340
Yes. You'll be working for me until
you pay off your parents' debt.

03:50.715 --> 03:52.967
Now get in the back
and change your clothes.

03:57.847 --> 03:59.807
How about we feed
the cat, Ti Tessa?

03:59.891 --> 04:03.435
Give her a moment
to breathe. It's all new.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.730
It's all new! Ah!

04:05.855 --> 04:09.067
You got your money, Baptiste.
Why are you still here?

04:09.234 --> 04:13.238
No one makes manje kreyol like you.
You cook like home.

04:13.529 --> 04:14.530
Bah!

04:14.613 --> 04:16.908
Go in the kitchen, both of you.

04:21.954 --> 04:24.082

anything bad happen.

04:26.042 --> 04:27.543
I promise.

04:31.756 --> 04:36.177
I got mad respect for you, OG.
You know, mad props.

04:38.263 --> 04:40.472
Um, can I ask you something?

04:40.848 --> 04:42.267
I don't know, can you?

04:43.101 --> 04:46.312
Yeah. It's just that my girl,
Mercy, is getting out,

04:46.437 --> 04:48.837
and I was thinking maybe you could
make that cake that you do.

04:50.066 --> 04:52.610
Like, the one you made at Easter.
That shit was the bomb.

04:52.693 --> 04:55.905
I made it to celebrate the
resurrection of Jesus Christ.

04:56.572 --> 04:58.824
Well, Mercy be resurrecting
up out of here, right?

04:59.033 --> 05:00.354
Don't you think
that deserve cake?

05:00.618 --> 05:03.413
Are you saying your Mercy is
like the good Lord, Jesus?

05:04.580 --> 05:08.376
Did your Mercy die for our sins?
I don't think so.

05:09.794 --> 05:10.836
She's my boo.

05:10.962 --> 05:15.007
I'm tired and not in the mood.
Go away now.

05:19.220 --> 05:21.472
My friends went
a little overboard.

05:22.932 --> 05:26.060
When I first got here, my friends
sent me all kind of shit, too.

05:26.144 --> 05:27.312
Enjoy it while it lasts.

05:27.937 --> 05:28.938
Oh.

05:29.439 --> 05:31.232
You got anything sexy in there?

05:31.316 --> 05:33.985
Um, I might have
some Nicholson Baker.

05:34.444 --> 05:35.445
Who?

05:35.569 --> 05:36.528
You need to leave.

05:36.654 --> 05:39.824
Take some books with you.
Educate yourself.

05:40.074 --> 05:41.451
Not that it helped this one.

05:43.535 --> 05:46.331
So, what you want?
You want some of this, huh?

05:46.414 --> 05:47.497
You like this?

05:48.124 --> 05:51.377
I can make you feel good.
That's how much I love my girl.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.963
I'm struck by your devotion.

05:54.046 --> 05:56.841
And sick to my stomach, too.
Get out!

05:58.176 --> 06:00.345
I'm gonna find
something you want, OG.

06:00.470 --> 06:02.054
You keep thinking,
I'll keep thinking.

06:02.180 --> 06:03.181
Out!

I'm sorry.
I'll organize them.

futility of blue-collar labor

07:07.912 --> 07:08.913

07:09.872 --> 07:13.918
If you want a tool,
turn in a chit.

07:14.668 --> 07:18.589
Chits have numbers. The
numbers are assigned to you.

07:18.964 --> 07:22.093
If the tools go missing,

07:22.427 --> 07:25.096

You.

My chit number is seven.
They all have seven on 'em.

07:36.482 --> 07:38.734
I hand a chit in,
I get my tool.

07:38.817 --> 07:40.486
I hand the tool back,
I get my chit back.

07:43.781 --> 07:45.616
Hey, Rabbit Pearl!

07:46.658 --> 07:48.744
Ease back, all right?
We're all gonna go numb.

07:50.746 --> 07:52.457
Anyways, simple as that.

07:52.582 --> 07:55.543
Mr. Luschek, I think that
there's been a mistake.

07:55.626 --> 07:58.129
I asked to be put in
the education program.

07:58.879 --> 07:59.919
Is that right, sweetheart?

07:59.964 --> 08:03.801
Yes. I think I'd be more useful there.
I was a TA in college.

08:03.926 --> 08:07.138
Oh, what's that, like,
"tits" and "ass?" (LAUGHS)

08:07.763 --> 08:10.308
I'm just saying that I know
something about teaching.

08:10.391 --> 08:12.810
I don't know the first thing
about electrical work.

08:13.144 --> 08:16.314
Uh, repeat after me,
"Don't electrocute yourself."

08:17.773 --> 08:19.066
"Don't electrocute yourself."

Now you know the first thing.

08:21.860 --> 08:24.155
Here, read this.

08:26.365 --> 08:27.366
Then

08:30.202 --> 08:31.203
fix this.

This is bullshit.

08:48.179 --> 08:49.180
You're making 11 cents an hour.

08:49.305 --> 08:50.681
Right. So I could,
like, save up

08:50.806 --> 08:53.017
and buy a $6 Pepsi
at the company store?

08:53.100 --> 08:55.019

Fine. Sit in the cage
and check out the tools.

In other words, sit on your
ass and do nothing all day.

You speakin' my language.
That's what I'm talking about.

09:27.092 --> 09:28.135

you in my kitchen.

They'll pay you
shit and work you

10:00.418 --> 10:01.669

so much for this.

10:08.426 --> 10:10.052
You don't come
back here, all right?

That's what I'm hopin'.

10:12.096 --> 10:13.472
I hope so, too.

10:24.858 --> 10:25.859
Fine.

10:26.235 --> 10:27.445
What about this?

10:27.945 --> 10:28.946
You'll swim in that.

10:29.029 --> 10:33.075
I was gonna cut it up for yoga straps.
You know, for stretching.

10:33.576 --> 10:35.453
Okay, whatever.

10:35.953 --> 10:39.123
"Whatever?" That's my shirt.
I gave you that shirt.

10:39.957 --> 10:44.002
Yeah. You gave it
to me, so it's mine.

10:44.754 --> 10:46.797
And I can give
it to who I want.

10:48.424 --> 10:52.136
Little girl, don't
make me go mental on you.

10:52.678 --> 10:54.680
Boo, you don't run me no more.

10:55.097 --> 10:56.098
Hmm.

10:56.348 --> 10:58.643
I know you miss my ass.

10:58.768 --> 11:00.852
But Tricia's been
taking real good care of it,

11:01.895 --> 11:03.814
and soon it's
walkin' out of here.

11:05.316 --> 11:06.817
Let me look at it.

11:07.985 --> 11:08.986
(SNIFFS)

11:09.069 --> 11:10.488
You might wanna wash it.

11:11.113 --> 11:12.490
Still got some stank on it.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.199
You know,

11:15.660 --> 11:17.911
it's not your ass
that I want anymore,

11:19.371 --> 11:20.414
it's your back.

11:20.498 --> 11:21.499
(SCOFFS)

11:22.583 --> 11:24.543
Yeah. You better
watch it, bitch.

11:31.883 --> 11:32.884
What's the drama?

11:33.010 --> 11:34.261
Mercy should
know better than to

11:34.345 --> 11:36.347
fuck with Boo this
close to her date.

11:37.181 --> 11:40.017
Oh, shit. Well, you think
she'll try something?

11:40.267 --> 11:41.935
She stole Shelly's date.

11:42.687 --> 11:43.853
Shelly?

11:43.937 --> 11:46.064
Mrs. Boo,
three Mrs. Boos ago.

11:47.274 --> 11:50.110
The week before her date,
Boo had some girl jump her.

11:51.236 --> 11:52.655
There was a fight.

11:52.738 --> 11:55.449
Shelly had been
growing out her nails,

11:55.533 --> 11:57.702
mauled that girl like a tiger.

11:58.076 --> 11:59.995
Caught two more
years down the hill.

12:02.456 --> 12:03.666
Jeez.

12:08.754 --> 12:11.674
"Remove the stand
off the body..."

12:11.757 --> 12:13.551
Hey, how about
a lunch break, Chapman?

12:13.634 --> 12:17.388
Oh, God. Yes, please.
(LAUGHS)

12:20.015 --> 12:21.016
Thanks.

Bologna.

12:24.269 --> 12:25.437
(SIGHS)

12:30.234 --> 12:31.443
Like your lunch?

12:31.569 --> 12:33.612
Mmm. I'm not complaining.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.115
You learn fast.
So, how's it going?

12:38.075 --> 12:39.577
I can't get my lamp to turn on.

12:39.785 --> 12:42.037
Yeah, long day for you.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.374
Well, I, on the other hand, am
feeling great job satisfaction.

12:45.457 --> 12:47.917
My hole in the wall
goes very deep.

12:49.211 --> 12:51.589
So, how's your mental health?

12:51.756 --> 12:52.840
You know, I can't
shake the feeling

12:52.922 --> 12:55.133
that at the end of the day
I'm gonna be able to go home.

12:59.597 --> 13:02.516
And, like, in the morning,
when I wake up,

13:03.851 --> 13:07.354
there are these few seconds
before I realize where I am,

13:08.272 --> 13:11.275
and then I do realize,
and I can't breathe.

13:12.484 --> 13:17.281
And I wanna cry and throw
shit and kill myself.

13:19.074 --> 13:20.325
(SIGHS)

13:22.536 --> 13:23.662
When does that end?

13:25.289 --> 13:26.415
I'll let you know.

13:28.709 --> 13:31.336
Lunch is over, ladies.
Back in.

13:31.462 --> 13:32.797
No, but we just sat down.

13:33.923 --> 13:36.341
And now you can get up
and get back to work.

13:37.134 --> 13:38.374
Speaking of which,
what the fuck

13:38.385 --> 13:39.470
are you doing in there,
Nichols?

13:39.595 --> 13:41.722
I'm makin' you
a glory hole, Luschek.

13:42.139 --> 13:43.557
Then, by all means, carry on.

13:43.641 --> 13:44.642
(SCOFFS)

13:45.476 --> 13:46.644
Back inside.

13:49.730 --> 13:51.091
MISS CLAUDETTE:
Is there a problem?

13:51.816 --> 13:54.359
Not at all. In fact,
I have some good news.

13:55.277 --> 13:56.986
We could all stand
a little good news.

13:57.655 --> 14:01.366
Your case manager called, and there's
interest in reopening your case.

14:03.034 --> 14:07.957
Seems to be some immigration
law reform, blah-di-blah.

14:08.039 --> 14:10.375
You're being reviewed
for potential early release.

14:12.962 --> 14:14.421
I don't care to
dredge up the past.

14:15.339 --> 14:18.425
This could mean
a lot less time.

14:20.344 --> 14:23.388
I appreciate the opportunity,
but no, thank you.

14:24.974 --> 14:27.977
It will be a whole lot of
aggravation for nothing.

14:28.727 --> 14:30.270
I know how these things go.

14:33.064 --> 14:34.358
Is there anything else?

14:35.860 --> 14:37.987
No. No.

14:40.739 --> 14:42.449
I'll let 'em
know your decision.

14:44.201 --> 14:47.371
That's the way it is. You
work, you pay off your debt,

14:47.872 --> 14:50.040
then you go off and live your life.
Do you understand?

14:52.417 --> 14:54.618
You can wear it with slacks,
or with a skirt and tights.

14:54.712 --> 14:56.087
What do you prefer?

14:56.213 --> 14:57.422
Skirt.

14:59.383 --> 15:01.969
Okay. It is important that
you keep your uniform clean.

15:02.177 --> 15:04.847
You can't be trusted to clean a
house if you can't keep yourself.

15:05.096 --> 15:06.598
Yes, Miss Claudette.

15:06.724 --> 15:08.934
When you go to people's
homes, you will be polite,

15:09.226 --> 15:11.478
and clean, and respectful.

15:11.562 --> 15:14.189
No foolishness, no laziness.

15:14.272 --> 15:17.275
And it's,
"Yes, ma'am," "Yes, sir."

15:17.568 --> 15:19.361
No back talk, understood?

15:20.237 --> 15:21.279
Speak up, child.

15:21.446 --> 15:22.823
Sorry. Yes, ma'am.

15:23.240 --> 15:24.241
Good.

15:24.533 --> 15:25.492
Put your things away

15:25.576 --> 15:28.746
and come into the kitchen for
some food when you've settled in.

15:34.084 --> 15:35.085
Baptiste!

15:35.168 --> 15:36.378
(CHUCKLES)
Oh!

15:38.797 --> 15:41.008
You were gone long this trip.

15:41.091 --> 15:42.259
Too long.

15:43.635 --> 15:44.803
I brought something for you.

15:45.637 --> 15:46.718
You know I don't like gifts.

15:46.764 --> 15:49.140
Everyone likes gifts, even you.

15:49.808 --> 15:51.435
Mangoes!

15:53.437 --> 15:54.521
Thank you.

15:55.439 --> 15:56.523
They're my favorites.

15:56.774 --> 15:57.816
I know that.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.487
Hey...

16:03.447 --> 16:05.032
Claudette, I got married.

16:07.868 --> 16:08.869
Oh.

16:12.623 --> 16:13.707
Congratulations.

16:14.625 --> 16:15.751
She's here.

16:16.085 --> 16:17.965
She's here? What do you mean,
she's here? Where?

16:19.797 --> 16:21.256
Josephine, come here.

16:24.969 --> 16:26.428
Hello.
Bonjour.

16:26.929 --> 16:29.431
Claudette, this is Josephine.

16:31.141 --> 16:33.978
Come in, please.
So nice to meet you.

16:34.853 --> 16:36.647
Can I get you
something to drink?

16:36.772 --> 16:38.065
Yes, that would be wonderful.

16:38.148 --> 16:40.025
Orange juice?
Perfect.

16:40.150 --> 16:43.570
I'll get it.
Claudette, sit down.

16:48.951 --> 16:49.994
Can I get you a malta?

16:50.077 --> 16:51.996
Uh, yes, thank you.
In the icebox.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.669
My husband speaks of you often.

16:59.003 --> 17:02.464
Yes. We've been
friends a long time.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.681
I don't know how you've
done it all these years.

17:05.175 --> 17:06.175
Done what?

17:06.300 --> 17:07.678
Oh, taken in
these children when

17:07.761 --> 17:09.512
you couldn't have
children of your own.

17:09.596 --> 17:11.140
It must be so difficult.

17:13.183 --> 17:14.685
I've made my peace with it.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.689
PIPER: "Put the body
in the base and..."

17:19.815 --> 17:22.483
And turn it... All right.

17:22.567 --> 17:23.694
Okay.

17:23.819 --> 17:24.944
(SCREAMS) Ow!

17:25.403 --> 17:26.570
(LAUGHS)

17:26.905 --> 17:28.699
Aw, it's like free
shock therapy.

17:28.782 --> 17:32.036
You might lose your short-term
memory, but it's a sweet escape.

17:32.161 --> 17:33.996
Work's done.
Wrap it up, ladies.

17:34.079 --> 17:35.789
I couldn't make my lamp work.

17:35.873 --> 17:37.582
You'll try again tomorrow.
But you said...

17:37.708 --> 17:40.085
I say a lot of shit,
then I wanna go home.

17:40.669 --> 17:42.629
So, clean up,
return your tools.

17:44.506 --> 17:45.799
Uh-uh.

17:45.883 --> 17:48.052
You get out of the cage when
all the tools are back in.

17:48.552 --> 17:50.303
(IMITATING MONKEY CHATTERING)

17:50.387 --> 17:53.598
Yeah, keep that up. Gonna throw
some shit at you, cracker.

17:54.391 --> 17:55.392
(ALARM BUZZING)

17:55.475 --> 17:56.727
Hit the floor, ladies.

17:56.810 --> 17:57.810
What the hell is going on?

17:57.895 --> 17:59.897
When the alarm goes off, you have
to lay face-down on the ground.

17:59.980 --> 18:02.273
Why? Because the
white man said so.

18:02.399 --> 18:03.400
She's right.

18:05.903 --> 18:07.696
MAN OVER RADIO:
False alarm, false alarm.

18:07.779 --> 18:11.575
Some rookie thought it was
a light switch. Back to stat.

18:11.700 --> 18:12.910
Copy that.

18:44.066 --> 18:46.110
It was called off.
What?

18:46.235 --> 18:49.154
You can get up. False alarm.
Everything is fine.

18:49.279 --> 18:50.488
That alarm scared me.

18:50.614 --> 18:52.532
Yeah. It's loud.

18:54.993 --> 18:58.080
I'm trying to stop smoking.
My buddy says that this helps.

18:58.705 --> 19:01.291
Menthols were my thing.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.834
Newports.

19:03.668 --> 19:04.878
Still jonesin'.

19:04.962 --> 19:05.963
(CHUCKLES)

19:08.257 --> 19:09.549
Can I try some?

19:10.425 --> 19:12.052
Um, I guess if...

19:14.387 --> 19:16.265
You can trust me,
I'm not gonna tell anyone.

19:23.438 --> 19:26.191
Where do you put it? Like,
underneath your tongue or...

19:26.316 --> 19:28.652
Between your lip and
your lower front teeth.

19:28.777 --> 19:29.903
Okay. Just...

19:29.987 --> 19:30.988
Here.

19:39.955 --> 19:41.123
That's disgusting.

19:41.206 --> 19:42.207
(GAGS)

19:45.043 --> 19:46.336
That's horrible.
(CHUCKLES)

19:47.171 --> 19:50.966
Thanks. Sorry.
I didn't like that.

19:51.800 --> 19:53.969
It's gross, I know. I shouldn't
really do it either.

19:55.804 --> 19:57.014
(BOTH LAUGHING)

19:57.097 --> 19:58.658
You got a little
between your two teeth.

19:58.723 --> 20:00.184
Oh.

20:00.309 --> 20:05.396
No, the other two, but also those.
It's in all your teeth.

20:06.023 --> 20:07.344
Wait, hold on.
What are you doing?

20:07.983 --> 20:11.320
Would you use it as
a toothpick and...

20:11.402 --> 20:13.697
Would you? Just...

20:14.072 --> 20:15.199
Yeah.

20:22.497 --> 20:25.375
LUSCHEK: Come on, this is ridiculous.
The screwdriver is missing?

20:25.917 --> 20:27.627
Someone's gotta have it.
I don't know.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.341
Where's the list of names?

20:33.217 --> 20:34.218
What do you mean?

20:34.343 --> 20:36.136
I told you for every
chit that comes in,

20:36.220 --> 20:37.346
there has to be
a name written down.

20:37.512 --> 20:38.972
You did not tell me that.

20:39.056 --> 20:41.016
You told me to take
the chit, give the tool,

20:41.099 --> 20:43.685
get the tool back,
give back the chit.

20:43.768 --> 20:44.895
I fucking did that.

20:45.187 --> 20:46.437
(SCREAMS)
Who the hell has it?

20:47.064 --> 20:49.191
I don't know...
God!

20:52.903 --> 20:55.239
Fuck!
(ALARM BUZZING)

20:56.531 --> 21:01.370
A screwdriver is considered
a deadly weapon.

21:01.619 --> 21:06.250
That is another five
years on your sentence

21:06.333 --> 21:09.169
if you are caught with
it in your possession.

21:09.253 --> 21:11.838
I don't like being threatened
for something I didn't do.

21:12.214 --> 21:17.594
No. I'm not threatening you, I'm
informing you of the facts.

21:17.928 --> 21:21.639
Sounds like a threat to me. I
already told you, I don't have it.

21:21.765 --> 21:24.268
I put her in charge of
the tools, it's her fault.

21:24.393 --> 21:27.938
Yo, don't be tryin' to pass the
buck on me, it's your fuckin' job.

21:28.021 --> 21:29.731
I'm just a monkey
in a cage, remember?

21:29.814 --> 21:31.066
Oh, no, no, I think
that she means her...

21:31.149 --> 21:33.568
No, I don't need you translating
for me, Honey Boo Boo.

21:33.651 --> 21:34.945
CAPUTO: Be quiet!

21:35.737 --> 21:38.031
If you had done
your job correctly,

21:38.115 --> 21:40.825
we would know who is
responsible for this theft.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.287
I want all these
women searched.

21:43.412 --> 21:45.122
I don't know about
these other bitches,

21:45.205 --> 21:47.958
but no man-guard is patting
me down and coppin' a feel.

21:48.083 --> 21:50.794
Of course, as is your right.

21:51.169 --> 21:54.965
Donaldson, take her down to
SHU and let her wait there

21:55.132 --> 21:57.801
until we can find
a female officer to

21:57.926 --> 22:00.553
conduct a thorough,
thorough search.

22:00.637 --> 22:02.680
Don't touch me,
I can walk out myself.

22:02.806 --> 22:05.058
Yo, motherfucker is a drunk!

22:05.142 --> 22:09.313
Yo, smell his breath!
Yo, motherfucker is a drunk!

22:11.606 --> 22:14.859
Anyone else have a problem
with a male officer?

22:17.112 --> 22:21.158
If you cooperate, it tells
me you have nothing to hide.

22:22.451 --> 22:26.413
If you know who took this
weapon and do not speak up,

22:26.537 --> 22:31.209
you will be considered an
accomplice and charged accordingly.

22:44.014 --> 22:47.351
If your memory is jogged, you
all know where my office is.

22:54.399 --> 22:55.608
Yep, they're good.

22:55.692 --> 22:58.527
Everyone return to camp,
report back here tomorrow.

22:58.653 --> 23:01.530
Jesus Christ, that was scary.
Did he touch your tit?

23:01.739 --> 23:03.700
Cupped my ass.
Who do you think took it?

23:08.079 --> 23:09.456
Someone's going down for this.

23:21.218 --> 23:23.220
You think your angry
friend, Janae, took it?

23:23.720 --> 23:25.120
I wouldn't say
that she's my friend.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.516
I say, "Hi," she says,
"Shut the fuck up."

23:27.598 --> 23:29.434
I say, "Hey, how's it going?"

23:29.558 --> 23:32.396
She sucks her teeth,
maybe calls me "bitch"

23:32.479 --> 23:34.314
or "you Taylor Swift-ass
motherfucker."

23:34.398 --> 23:36.400
We're on our way.

23:36.525 --> 23:38.965
That's just fucking racist, you
look nothing like Taylor Swift.

23:39.027 --> 23:41.570
We do not all look alike,
despite what they think.

23:43.572 --> 23:45.075
Is SHU really that bad?

23:46.743 --> 23:50.372
It's just like the Hamptons,
only fucking horrible.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.790
Okay, yeah,
that was a dumb question.

23:53.624 --> 23:58.171
A lady next door to me in there ate a
rat, a live rat, 'cause it bit her.

23:58.922 --> 24:03.385
So, she bit it back,
and back, and back.

24:03.592 --> 24:04.593
Hey.

24:05.262 --> 24:07.097
Hey, brain,
I wanna ask you something.

24:08.473 --> 24:09.766
Okay.

24:11.476 --> 24:12.519
What is this?

24:12.601 --> 24:14.062
A letter to request an appeal.

24:14.771 --> 24:15.730
I need to get out,

24:15.813 --> 24:18.094
'cause my girlfriend's getting
out and I gotta be with her.

24:18.733 --> 24:20.985
Frankly, I can't wait for that
screamer to hit the bricks.

24:23.113 --> 24:26.783
I'm not so good with words, and
you read everything and shit,

24:26.908 --> 24:27.951
so you'll help me out?

24:29.286 --> 24:31.413
Sure, yeah.
I'll take a look at it.

24:35.959 --> 24:37.127
What?

24:37.252 --> 24:38.920
Happy hour.
Who's up for margaritas?

24:39.003 --> 24:41.089
Last time I drank tequila,
I woke up in Weehawken.

24:41.172 --> 24:42.924
Yeah, isn't that
where you're from?

24:43.007 --> 24:44.008
Fucking shithole.

24:44.134 --> 24:45.510
Yeah, well,
Piper loves tequila.

24:46.677 --> 24:49.097
I gotta go.

24:49.180 --> 24:51.558
What? Afraid I'll tell them
the pork chop story?

24:52.350 --> 24:54.060
NICKY: Yeah, this is
fuckin' weird, okay?

24:54.227 --> 24:57.646
I have a pork chop story, too.
You go first.

25:00.691 --> 25:01.859
They're under the bed.

25:01.985 --> 25:02.986
What?

25:03.361 --> 25:06.490
Your books.
I don't like clutter.

25:06.615 --> 25:09.284
Yeah. No, clutter's
the worst.

25:09.618 --> 25:11.244
You get hit on the head today?

25:11.828 --> 25:12.829
Okay.

25:15.957 --> 25:18.835
Yo! Dump your shit,
they're doing a sweep.

25:22.005 --> 25:23.006
My God.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.174
What did you do?

25:24.299 --> 25:26.217
I don't know. I literally...
I do not know.

25:26.343 --> 25:28.803
It was a mistake. I can't believe...
Fuck! Fuck!

25:29.346 --> 25:32.015
Outside! Both of you.

25:34.351 --> 25:36.936
This is a mandatory
random bunk inspection.

25:37.020 --> 25:39.221
I need to thoroughly search
your cubicle for contraband.

25:40.815 --> 25:42.025
(HUMMING)

26:24.150 --> 26:25.151
All clear.

26:30.114 --> 26:32.116
What were you thinking?

26:32.242 --> 26:33.201
(WHISPERING)
My sweatshirt was outside.

26:33.284 --> 26:34.911
I don't remember
putting it in my pocket.

26:34.994 --> 26:37.830
Maybe I am losing my memory.
Jesus.

26:37.914 --> 26:40.155
No, I'll just tell them the truth.
I'll just give it back.

26:40.250 --> 26:41.501
You can't do that!
Why?

26:41.585 --> 26:43.752
Because here they
don't believe the truth.

26:43.836 --> 26:46.256
They'll throw you in SHU
and me as an accomplice.

26:47.591 --> 26:49.676
What should I do? Should I just...
Should I dump it in the yard?

26:49.884 --> 26:52.803
Suppose some nut job,
like your peeing admirer,

26:52.929 --> 26:55.890
were to find it and stab your
tall girlfriend in the eye.

26:56.516 --> 26:57.892
It would come
back to you, and you

26:58.017 --> 26:59.352
would be
an accomplice to murder.

26:59.436 --> 27:04.773
If you ever want to go home, get
that screwdriver back on that wall.

27:06.276 --> 27:07.402
PORNSTACHE: All clear!

27:17.203 --> 27:18.204
Place looks like crap.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.957
We're lucky they're letting us
set up at all, after the raid.

27:21.207 --> 27:22.808
Would you get more
over on the left side?

27:24.294 --> 27:25.878
'Cause that'll really
make it more festive?

27:25.962 --> 27:26.963
(LAUGHS)

27:27.464 --> 27:29.382
All we need now is
a pinata full of rats.

27:30.300 --> 27:32.093
You know what, stretch?
Your ass

27:32.218 --> 27:33.970
just got uninvited.
Thanks for the help.

27:35.263 --> 27:38.475
Oh, shit. I just got uninvited to
the most depressing party ever.

27:39.601 --> 27:41.852
What will I do now to
make me not wanna kill myself?

27:41.978 --> 27:43.313
(LAUGHS)

27:44.230 --> 27:45.315
She's kind of right.

27:46.274 --> 27:48.693
This is more depressing
than a Tori Amos cover band.

27:48.817 --> 27:51.321
Look, when in Rome,
use what you got.

27:51.446 --> 27:52.489
Unless what you
got ain't enough

27:52.614 --> 27:54.449
to keep your woman.
Reflect, yo.

27:55.742 --> 27:57.742
Chapman's writing my appeal,
and she's hella smart,

27:57.744 --> 27:59.036
so I'm gonna be
out of here soon.

28:00.246 --> 28:01.998
With Mercy, my girl.

28:02.165 --> 28:04.292
(LAUGHS) Wigga, please.

28:04.375 --> 28:06.461
Mercy gonna dump your ass the
second she gets out of here.

28:06.544 --> 28:08.296
She likes new, shiny things.

28:08.379 --> 28:11.633
And out of here, you are
as dull as an old pencil,

28:12.258 --> 28:14.302
with saggy tits and a
fucked-up tattoo on its neck.

28:14.385 --> 28:19.890
Oh, Butchy, face it. I win, you lose.
She hates you. She loves me.

28:20.099 --> 28:23.144
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.
And she "loved" me, too.

28:23.978 --> 28:27.856
For two whole years, and then she
dropped my butch ass for you.

28:28.024 --> 28:29.567
And if you don't think
that's the way she do,

28:29.693 --> 28:32.028
then you are dumber than you look,
which is pretty fuckin' dumb,

28:32.153 --> 28:33.321
'cause you look like
your relatives have been

28:33.404 --> 28:34.905
fucking each
other for generations.

28:35.864 --> 28:38.827
Yeah, she'll do
the same to you.

28:40.036 --> 28:42.706
That girl was raised by animals,
she don't know how to love.

28:43.873 --> 28:45.834
Yeah? Well, you're fat.

28:48.712 --> 28:51.715
Oh, you got me.

29:12.193 --> 29:16.113
Hey, Dandelion!
I've been missin' on you.

29:17.323 --> 29:22.495
Hey, don't be ignoring me now.
I do like I do.

29:22.912 --> 29:25.956
Don't be mad at me, Dandelion.
I'm sorry.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.569
Just don't make me angry,
all right?

29:32.255 --> 29:34.841
You don't wanna see
me when I'm angry.

29:37.635 --> 29:39.763
So I drank a lot of water!

29:39.846 --> 29:40.889
Oh, my God.

29:42.973 --> 29:45.435
Oh, Mr. Healy. Do you mind if
I talk to you for a second?

29:45.518 --> 29:48.271
Chapman, I don't wanna hear
about the job thing.

29:48.938 --> 29:53.109
I put you in Electric because
there's toxic mold in the GED room.

29:53.192 --> 29:56.070
The education program
has been suspended.

29:56.153 --> 29:57.280
That's life. Deal with it.

29:57.781 --> 30:01.200
The... I... That's actually,
that's not um, what I...

30:03.327 --> 30:04.954
I actually wanted to thank you.

30:06.330 --> 30:07.415
Okay.

30:07.498 --> 30:09.166
Great. That's great.

30:13.003 --> 30:14.088
You wanted to thank me?

30:14.171 --> 30:18.802
Yes. Yeah.
I mean, I haven't...

30:19.636 --> 30:21.471
I haven't quite
figured it out yet,

30:21.554 --> 30:23.640
but I'm gonna be
able to rewire a lamp.

30:25.558 --> 30:29.019
Soon. And I'm very
excited about that.

30:29.145 --> 30:35.401
I've always felt that I lacked
practical skills in life and...

30:36.486 --> 30:37.487
I don't know.

30:37.821 --> 30:38.988
Are you okay, Chapman?

30:41.783 --> 30:43.624
No, no, no, I'm fine.
I'm just, I'm just tired.

30:43.660 --> 30:45.662
I hear there was
a problem in your shop.

30:45.954 --> 30:47.622
I hope you're staying
clear of trouble.

30:48.122 --> 30:52.251
Of course, of course,
of course. Yeah.

30:53.461 --> 30:54.963
I'm sure they'll
find the culprit.

30:55.212 --> 30:59.342
That's great. I gotta go.
Thank you for everything.

31:16.400 --> 31:18.152
(INDISTINCT TALKING)

31:21.948 --> 31:23.199
(SIGHS)

31:29.038 --> 31:31.165
Heard you were helping
Tricia with a letter.

31:32.041 --> 31:36.629
Oh, I just said that I would
look at it with her. I don't...

31:36.713 --> 31:37.797
I don't want any trouble.

31:38.548 --> 31:41.300
Neither do I. I just want
you to help me with mine.

31:41.384 --> 31:42.584
Yeah, me, too.
Yeah, same here.

31:44.888 --> 31:47.515
Well, I'm not a lawyer.
You guys know that, right?

31:47.598 --> 31:51.811
I just said that I would
look over it with her.

31:53.563 --> 31:56.065
But I guess that I can do
that with you guys, too.

31:56.148 --> 32:01.404
So, why don't we set up a time to
talk, or, I guess, times to talk?

32:01.738 --> 32:04.114
Why not now?
No day like today.

32:08.786 --> 32:09.787
Now is really not a good time.

32:09.913 --> 32:11.205
Wow, blanca. Really?

32:11.288 --> 32:13.082
No. I need to look
over everything first,

32:13.165 --> 32:14.542
so why don't you
leave the papers with me.

32:14.625 --> 32:15.706
Okay, well, how about this?

32:15.752 --> 32:17.086
I'm innocent, I was set up.
How about that?

32:17.211 --> 32:19.129
Yeah. Shit, I wasn't even in
Jersey when that shit went down.

32:19.255 --> 32:21.925
And, I mean, I may be a thief, but
I'm not an embezzler, you know.

32:22.050 --> 32:23.300
And that guy shot himself.

32:23.426 --> 32:24.886
We should probably look at...
I don't know anybody.

32:24.969 --> 32:26.554
This is my room.

32:28.305 --> 32:29.766
Not a sorority.

32:32.142 --> 32:35.187
I'm sorry. I know how
you feel about guests.

32:35.271 --> 32:38.441
I asked them to leave. They
are looking for legal help.

32:38.566 --> 32:39.984
If you want to
open a law office,

32:40.109 --> 32:42.653
do it someplace else.
Not in my room!

32:45.990 --> 32:46.991
Ladies,

32:48.117 --> 32:49.118
if you don't mind.

32:50.995 --> 32:52.830
Food stamp fraud?
I mean, really,

32:52.956 --> 32:54.791
I was only feeding
starving children.

33:02.423 --> 33:03.424
Yeah.

33:11.515 --> 33:13.517
Did you take care of
that problem of yours?

33:14.018 --> 33:15.478
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.105
Yeah. It's all good.

33:21.484 --> 33:24.153
Wait, shortie, you want a book
to read, or a step stool?

33:24.236 --> 33:28.032
'Cause I tell you right now, you ain't
steppin' on the Goblet of Fire.

33:28.157 --> 33:29.993
Don't be fuckin'
with Harry Potter.

33:30.076 --> 33:33.121
Now, you could
step up on Ulysses.

33:33.203 --> 33:37.166
Everyone says it's so genius,
but I call it bullshit.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.835
No one wants to go through
all that ramblin'.

33:38.918 --> 33:41.629
Ain't nobody got time for that.

33:42.505 --> 33:44.786
Look at you, you're having a
little Barnes & Nobles moment.

33:44.799 --> 33:48.011
Oh, my bunkie is
hosting Bible study,

33:48.177 --> 33:50.138
which usually I can tune out,

33:50.304 --> 33:51.681
but once they
started arguing over

33:51.764 --> 33:54.266
who gets raptured first,
I had to go.

33:54.892 --> 33:56.393
Yeah.

33:56.519 --> 33:58.312
I am so getting raptured first.

33:58.395 --> 33:59.897
Yeah, I've technically
died on three

34:00.023 --> 34:02.108
separate occasions
and I've met God.

34:02.775 --> 34:04.193
Dude fucking loves me.
(LAUGHS)

34:06.154 --> 34:09.239
I had this roommate,
she was a history major.

34:10.116 --> 34:13.870
She claims that she died
doing a bunch of whip-its

34:14.328 --> 34:15.808
and that an angel
of darkness gave her

34:15.871 --> 34:18.415
all the answers to her Renaissance
final and sent her back.

34:18.916 --> 34:21.002
How'd she do?
I think she got a B.

34:21.377 --> 34:23.629
That's not bad.
Yeah.

34:23.713 --> 34:24.922
What was your major?

34:25.255 --> 34:28.009
Oh, I just lived on campus,
went to parties.

34:28.092 --> 34:30.427
No moolah and no school-ah.

34:31.428 --> 34:35.891
Although sometimes I sat in on classes.
Film classes, free movies.

34:37.893 --> 34:39.062
Is that how you know Chapman?

34:43.440 --> 34:44.650
Kind of.

34:45.400 --> 34:46.902
Look, I've been in
here almost three years.

34:46.985 --> 34:49.530
I thought I saw all the
permutations of runcher theater,

34:49.612 --> 34:51.489
but you two are in
a whole new play.

34:52.324 --> 34:54.702
What the fuck
went on with you outside?

34:55.119 --> 34:56.704
I don't know. Things.

34:59.082 --> 35:00.083
And stuff.

35:01.584 --> 35:05.588
Fine. I'll let my imagination
keep running wild.

35:05.922 --> 35:08.132
Wait, three years? How much
time do you have left?

35:08.883 --> 35:09.842
Two more.

35:09.926 --> 35:11.468
Jesus fuck.

35:12.095 --> 35:13.096
What for?

35:13.930 --> 35:16.599
Drugs, basically.
What do you have?

35:19.018 --> 35:21.437
Counting good time,
subtract the three,

35:21.520 --> 35:23.731
add the one...
A fuckload.

35:24.815 --> 35:26.025
Of shitty time.

35:27.110 --> 35:31.239
With shitty, smelly, farting,

35:31.321 --> 35:34.200
crazy, stupid fucking bitches.

35:35.534 --> 35:37.203
Most of whom fucking hate me.

35:40.164 --> 35:43.167
Yo, should we plan an escape?

35:43.292 --> 35:44.293
(LAUGHS)

35:44.877 --> 35:45.920
Where do you wanna go?

35:47.630 --> 35:51.759
I don't even know anymore.
I used to.

35:55.138 --> 35:57.014
I had grand plans.

35:59.183 --> 36:01.769
Now I can't even get past the
swirling darkness in my brain

36:01.852 --> 36:05.439
long enough to
land on anything.

36:06.482 --> 36:07.524
(SOBS)

36:10.027 --> 36:13.781
Oh, man. I was just starting
to like you, Vause.

36:14.490 --> 36:15.825
You gonna go soft on me?

36:19.662 --> 36:20.663
(SNIFFLES)

36:21.330 --> 36:24.167
Oh, fuck. Come here.

36:26.460 --> 36:27.878
It'll be okay, sister.

36:29.338 --> 36:31.139
There's always hope
tomorrow'll be taco night.

36:31.507 --> 36:33.009
Tomorrow's beef and noodles.

36:34.718 --> 36:35.761
Or beef and noodles.

36:35.886 --> 36:36.971
(CHUCKLES)

36:44.145 --> 36:45.188
What are you reading?

36:46.355 --> 36:48.816
Oh, I'm going
over Tricia's appeal.

36:48.899 --> 36:51.443
It's a... It's a mess.

36:52.111 --> 36:55.906
I want to say no,
but she really needs help.

36:56.866 --> 36:57.992
Is the light bothering you?

36:58.742 --> 36:59.910
The light is fine.

37:00.036 --> 37:01.037
Okay.

37:02.705 --> 37:06.750
Have you ever written anything like this?
An appeal?

37:07.793 --> 37:09.503
I'm really not
sure where to start.

37:15.051 --> 37:18.888
(WHISPERING) Miss Claudette?
Are you asleep?

37:20.723 --> 37:23.309
Maybe you should stay out
of other people's affairs.

37:24.768 --> 37:27.980
Maybe. But maybe a heartfelt
and actually legible letter

37:28.064 --> 37:31.192
would help her case, you know?

37:31.275 --> 37:32.735
There's always a chance, right?

37:34.695 --> 37:36.364
Hope is a dangerous thing.

37:38.949 --> 37:42.703
You come in here and you tell
me you've come up empty?

37:43.412 --> 37:48.417
No, that's unacceptable.
It's totally unacceptable.

37:48.500 --> 37:49.710
You find it.

37:49.877 --> 37:52.796
Sir, shouldn't this
be on Luschek?

37:53.756 --> 37:55.925
It's Luschek's
fault it's missing,

37:56.050 --> 37:59.387
it's your fault
it hasn't been found.

38:00.221 --> 38:03.099
You go easy on these girls
and what happens?

38:03.182 --> 38:04.474
They take advantage.

38:04.975 --> 38:08.687
These women are fucking criminals.
Have you forgotten that?

38:09.105 --> 38:11.440
And don't get me
started on Luschek.

38:11.565 --> 38:13.525
You know how many times
I tried to fire his ass?

38:13.609 --> 38:16.279
Fucking unions were not created

38:16.362 --> 38:17.947
to protect
the drunk and retarded,

38:18.030 --> 38:19.365
yet lookie here.
(LAUGHS)

38:22.285 --> 38:25.204
It's a lot harder to laugh
with a punctured lung.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.497
It goes right between the ribs.
(LAUGHS)

38:28.624 --> 38:29.792
Ticklish, sir.

38:32.502 --> 38:34.588
It can be used to kill a CO.

38:35.131 --> 38:37.800
It's happened before
and it wouldn't surprise me

38:37.883 --> 38:40.136
if it happened again.

38:40.261 --> 38:42.096
Find the fucking screwdriver!

38:51.855 --> 38:53.575
(WHISPERS) The screwdriver
is still in there.

38:54.150 --> 38:55.443
What?

38:56.319 --> 38:57.611
I tried returning
it to the shop,

38:57.736 --> 38:59.057
but they were
patting people down.

38:59.322 --> 39:00.406
You lied to me?

39:00.489 --> 39:01.490
I was gonna
return it this morning.

39:01.615 --> 39:03.867
I didn't realize that there
was gonna be a sneak attack.

39:04.618 --> 39:05.869
Where is it?

39:07.663 --> 39:08.789
It's under the mattress.

39:27.683 --> 39:28.851
It's clean!

39:31.687 --> 39:33.689
This is a mandatory
bunk inspection.

39:33.814 --> 39:35.975
I need to thoroughly search
your cubicle for contraband.

information, please come forward.

39:41.613 --> 39:45.493
You're as sick as your secrets, ladies.
Sick as your secrets.

39:46.369 --> 39:49.038
It's gone. I have
no idea where it went.

39:50.122 --> 39:52.333
I'm losing my mind. Jesus!

39:53.334 --> 39:54.543
Am I really going crazy?

39:56.128 --> 39:58.339
Shit. Well,

40:00.883 --> 40:04.636
either way, problem solved.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.681
My problem is solved,
yours has just begun.

40:08.891 --> 40:09.892
What?

40:10.184 --> 40:14.271
You lied to me. That's strike two.
If there's a strike three...

40:14.397 --> 40:17.441
Can you please just cut me
a little bit of slack?

40:18.401 --> 40:19.485
Slack?

40:19.776 --> 40:20.819
Slack!

40:24.740 --> 40:27.451
I have been here for
less than two weeks.

40:29.203 --> 40:33.040
I have been
starved out, felt up,

40:34.917 --> 40:39.338
teased, stalked, threatened,

40:39.796 --> 40:41.924
and called Taylor Swift.

40:42.049 --> 40:45.010
And now, you.

40:47.637 --> 40:49.806
I am doing my best
to learn the ropes.

40:49.932 --> 40:51.850
I really, really am.

is no longer here.

40:57.356 --> 40:59.036
(NORMAL VOICE) It cannot
get you in trouble.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.320
I take full responsibility,

41:03.446 --> 41:05.614
and I may be suffering from
short-term memory loss

41:05.739 --> 41:06.782
and I don't know why,

41:06.865 --> 41:09.952
so can you please
just cut me some slack?

41:13.122 --> 41:14.290
Okay?

Do you hear what I'm saying?

41:24.967 --> 41:27.052
Everyone must take a shower.

41:27.803 --> 41:32.266
You go in, get undressed,
and bathe now.

41:33.559 --> 41:35.478
What's going on?

41:35.978 --> 41:37.854
Speak up for yourself!

41:39.565 --> 41:40.983

Don't know how you
are with the word stuff,

43:25.837 --> 43:27.631
but "uninvited"
means "not invited."

43:28.048 --> 43:29.592
Yeah, I'm just
using the microwave.

43:29.758 --> 43:30.926
Yeah, right.

I don't want to be
at this lame-ass thing anyway.

And yet you decided
to cook your noodles

to me, white girl.

No. I'm gonna miss you.

get into your head.

No.

You all right, kitten?

45:10.651 --> 45:13.195
I think I might've gotten Miss
Claudette really mad at me.

45:14.697 --> 45:17.700
Look, you know how some people
have imaginary friends?

45:18.908 --> 45:21.953
I think you might
have imaginary enemies.

Yes, I would.

45:37.093 --> 45:38.721
She said you were a squirter.

I don't... That's...

Once. It happened once. And
it took us both by surprise.

45:49.356 --> 45:50.399
Wow.

45:51.149 --> 45:54.194
I was kidding. But good to know.
Oh!

Whatever they are,
she's keeping your secrets.

More than once.

and hurt me in my sleep?

Who, Alex?

46:06.832 --> 46:09.376
No. Miss Claudette.

Miss Claudette was into some
kind of slave-trade shit.
