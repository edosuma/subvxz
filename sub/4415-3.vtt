WEBVTT

00:03.439 --> 00:05.226
Oh. How did we end up here again?

00:05.287 --> 00:07.954
Sorry. I just have no time
for errands during the week.

00:07.955 --> 00:10.390
It's our one night out.
We should do something fun.

00:10.392 --> 00:11.691
We could try a different mall.

00:11.693 --> 00:13.260
Perfect.

00:13.262 --> 00:15.996
All right, let's play
Who Would We Swing With?

00:15.998 --> 00:17.631
- Ugh.
- Come on, it's fun.

00:17.633 --> 00:19.023
I'm not swinging with anyone.

00:19.068 --> 00:21.168
- The Franks?
- No way.

00:21.170 --> 00:24.438
- Why not?
- Eric's breath smells like ass.

00:24.440 --> 00:27.274
Okay. Um... the Klines?

00:27.276 --> 00:29.076
I don't think so.

00:29.078 --> 00:30.077
Why? Dean's cute.

00:30.079 --> 00:31.845
He's got baby hands.

00:31.847 --> 00:34.815
- The Davidoffs?
- Why don't you just e-mail me a list of

00:34.817 --> 00:36.716
the woman that you want to have sex with,

00:36.718 --> 00:38.318
and I'll reply with what's
wrong with their husbands?

00:38.320 --> 00:39.820
Oh, come on. You never think

00:39.822 --> 00:41.688
- about any of the dads in the school?
- Not really.

00:41.690 --> 00:44.191
Look, if I'm gonna
have sex with another man,

00:44.193 --> 00:46.059
it's not gonna be a regular guy.

00:46.061 --> 00:48.328
What, so now I'm a regular guy?

00:48.330 --> 00:51.832
Regular's not bad. Regular's just regular.

00:51.834 --> 00:54.015

00:59.941 --> 01:03.437
Geez. Mondays are overwhelming, right?

01:03.479 --> 01:05.345
Totally. But it's Tuesday.

01:05.346 --> 01:06.947
Hump day.

01:06.949 --> 01:08.682
Nope.

01:08.684 --> 01:10.651
Excuse me. Lina?

01:10.653 --> 01:12.252
Oh, hi.

01:12.254 --> 01:13.987
A single dad. Too cute.

01:13.989 --> 01:15.255
I-I can't.

01:15.257 --> 01:16.256
Can't...?

01:16.258 --> 01:18.025
Wha...?

01:18.027 --> 01:19.960
Hi. Is everything okay with Lilly?

01:19.962 --> 01:22.529
Yeah, everything's fine. I just, uh...

01:22.531 --> 01:24.998
You have been such a big help,

01:25.000 --> 01:27.801
- doing her braids and everything.
- Well, she's a great kid.

01:27.803 --> 01:30.604
Uh, I just wanted to give you something

01:30.606 --> 01:32.039
as a thank you.

01:32.041 --> 01:33.774
Wow. Oh.

01:33.776 --> 01:35.642
That's really nice.

01:37.012 --> 01:38.478
What scent is that?

01:38.480 --> 01:41.048
Uh... red?

01:42.484 --> 01:43.784
I love it.

01:43.786 --> 01:45.619
Thank you.

01:45.621 --> 01:47.888
No. Thank you.

01:47.890 --> 01:50.857
Wow. None of the single
dads ever buy me presents.

01:50.859 --> 01:52.693
He's not just a single dad.

01:52.695 --> 01:54.161
He's a single widower.

01:54.163 --> 01:57.297
Aren't all widowers single?

01:57.299 --> 01:58.532
Yes.

01:58.534 --> 02:00.233
Tragically single.

02:00.235 --> 02:02.502
They were great husbands,
took care of their wives,

02:02.504 --> 02:05.405
but now they have to be
strong for the children.

02:05.407 --> 02:07.541
It's so hot.

02:07.543 --> 02:10.176
I never thought about it that way before.

02:10.179 --> 02:11.812
I have.

02:11.814 --> 02:14.081
Clearly.

02:14.083 --> 02:17.384
- Too bad you're married.
- Mm.

02:17.386 --> 02:20.220
Hey, do you ever go on double dates?

02:20.222 --> 02:23.357
Ooh.

02:25.059 --> 02:27.494
Who do you share this office with?

02:27.496 --> 02:28.929
No one. It's all mine.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.430
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:30.432 --> 02:32.566
Wow. Yeah, even got my own assistant.

02:32.568 --> 02:34.034
Oh, my God. What's her deal?

02:34.036 --> 02:35.902
Is she hotter than me?

02:35.904 --> 02:37.838
And what, this is all design?

02:37.840 --> 02:39.906
Yeah. I do concept development,

02:39.908 --> 02:42.409
you know, design solutions,
product road maps.

02:42.411 --> 02:44.911
Ooh. Those words make me sleepy.

02:46.715 --> 02:49.683
I basically draw circles
and I put 'em on T-shirts.

02:49.685 --> 02:52.252
- That is chill.
- The hours are crazy, you know.

02:52.254 --> 02:54.087
I never see the kids,

02:54.089 --> 02:56.590
and Lina and I rarely have
a moment alone together.

02:56.592 --> 02:58.325
What about date night?

02:58.327 --> 03:00.794
Yeah, we're kind of in
a little bit of a rut there.

03:00.796 --> 03:03.552
Mm. You should come out
with me on Saturday.

03:03.554 --> 03:05.799
I'm hitting a really cool opening,
and I will put you on the list.

03:05.801 --> 03:07.234
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.236 --> 03:09.436
- Oh, that could be cool.
- Yeah?

03:09.438 --> 03:11.638
Can I bring Lina? I mean, you can try,

03:11.640 --> 03:13.607
but there's no way
Lina would ever go downtown.

03:13.609 --> 03:15.675
No, I guess you're right. What about Shep?

03:15.677 --> 03:17.144
Not exactly his speed.

03:17.146 --> 03:21.248
Why did we marry the wrong people?

03:21.250 --> 03:22.749
What?

03:22.751 --> 03:24.484
You know what I mean.

03:24.486 --> 03:26.887
Just, like, people
that are not as fun as us.

03:32.326 --> 03:34.895
Guess what.

03:34.897 --> 03:37.764
Hmm. - I have a plan for date night.

03:37.766 --> 03:40.267
What? No, I already made a plan for us.

03:40.269 --> 03:41.668
What's your plan?

03:41.670 --> 03:43.437
There's a pop-up shop downtown.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.272
A pop-up what? Where?

03:45.274 --> 03:48.642
A Japanese sneaker company is
renting out this warehouse.

03:48.644 --> 03:51.011
And there's some big guest DJ.

03:51.013 --> 03:54.114
There's a rumor going
around, it could be Malakai.

03:54.116 --> 03:55.916
Who?

03:55.918 --> 03:58.185
DJ Malakai?

03:58.187 --> 04:00.287
You know who that is?

04:00.289 --> 04:02.255
No, but Jess does.

04:02.257 --> 04:04.524
So go with Jess.

04:04.526 --> 04:07.194
Okay, fine, what's your great plan?

04:07.196 --> 04:10.330
Remember that dad
I told you about from class?

04:10.332 --> 04:12.332
- Warren, the widower?
- No clue.

04:12.334 --> 04:15.435
Well, I'm fixing him up
with a friend from school.

04:15.437 --> 04:16.837
Double date.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.605
Another fix-up?

04:18.607 --> 04:20.474
I have a feeling about this one.

04:20.476 --> 04:21.875
I do.

04:21.877 --> 04:23.343
And maybe even...

04:23.345 --> 04:25.011
a mention in the wedding toast.

04:25.013 --> 04:26.313
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

04:26.315 --> 04:27.547
Crazy romantic.

04:27.549 --> 04:30.350
A hot, lonely widower, a sad, single mom.

04:30.352 --> 04:31.751
Will they ever find love?

04:31.753 --> 04:33.353
I don't know. Tune in tonight.

04:33.355 --> 04:34.821
I am not tuning in.

04:34.823 --> 04:36.323
Well, I'm not canceling.

04:36.325 --> 04:37.491
Enjoy your date.

04:37.493 --> 04:39.693
Enjoy your date.

04:39.695 --> 04:41.361
- I will.
- Me, too.

04:45.823 --> 04:48.425
Ella wants to know
where you guys are going.

04:48.427 --> 04:50.227
Uh, Daddy's going to a shoe party

04:50.229 --> 04:51.843
in a dirty warehouse so he can be

04:51.931 --> 04:53.864
- the oldest person in the room.
- Mommy is gonna be

04:53.866 --> 04:56.066
the third wheel in a Lifetime movie.

04:56.068 --> 04:57.100
Wait.

04:57.102 --> 04:58.468
You're not going together?

04:58.470 --> 05:00.570
- Nope.
- Nope.

05:00.572 --> 05:01.672
Should I tell Ella you're in a fight?

05:01.674 --> 05:03.073
We're not in a fight.

05:03.075 --> 05:04.408
I thought you needed

05:04.410 --> 05:06.143
time together, just the two of you?

05:06.145 --> 05:07.244
Quality time?

05:07.246 --> 05:08.645
Yeah, we do.

05:08.647 --> 05:10.580
We also need time apart from each other.

05:10.582 --> 05:12.482
Quality apart time.

05:12.484 --> 05:14.084
You guys are weird.

05:14.086 --> 05:15.686
We're not weird, are we?

05:15.688 --> 05:17.521
No. I mean, it's just one night.

05:17.523 --> 05:19.323
- Yeah.
- Right?

05:19.325 --> 05:21.391
It's not like we're going
on separate vacations.

05:21.393 --> 05:24.928
No. Or leasing separate apartments.

05:24.930 --> 05:27.030
Not yet.

05:27.032 --> 05:30.000
Wait. What?

05:32.537 --> 05:34.871
I'm really excited to meet your husband.

05:34.873 --> 05:36.606
Mm. Yeah.

05:36.608 --> 05:38.008
Russ isn't coming.

05:38.010 --> 05:39.509
Wait. What?

05:39.511 --> 05:40.944
- Sorry.
- Russ isn't coming?

05:40.946 --> 05:43.180
No, we're having separate dates tonight.

05:43.182 --> 05:45.882
Oh, uh... you know what?

05:45.884 --> 05:47.784
Three's a weird number.

05:47.786 --> 05:49.753
- No, it's not. No.
- Yeah, it's a little weird.

05:49.755 --> 05:51.621
Maybe I should just go and let
the two of you get to...

05:51.623 --> 05:53.223
Oh, no, no, no, no,
you're not going anywhere.

05:53.225 --> 05:54.691
- I'm not?
- No.

05:54.693 --> 05:56.526
Let me ask you a question.

05:56.528 --> 05:58.729
Just... do you like being lonely?

05:58.731 --> 06:01.631
Um... no, I don't.

06:01.633 --> 06:04.034
This guy is a catch, okay?

06:04.036 --> 06:05.569
Okay.

06:05.571 --> 06:08.305
Cute widowers do not
stay on the market long.

06:08.307 --> 06:09.873
Is that true?

06:09.875 --> 06:11.708
Look it up.

06:11.710 --> 06:13.844
Yeah, I just... I don't know.

06:13.846 --> 06:15.412
I'm just really bad at dating.

06:15.414 --> 06:16.413
Mm-hmm.

06:16.415 --> 06:18.382
Like, very bad at it.

06:18.384 --> 06:22.519
And, uh, like, I have trouble...
words and... saying.

06:22.521 --> 06:24.154
That's why I'm here.

06:24.156 --> 06:26.189
I'm gonna help steer you
in the right direction.

06:26.191 --> 06:27.991
And my first piece of guidance is,

06:27.993 --> 06:30.494
steer clear of the dead wife.

06:30.496 --> 06:32.863
What dead wife?

06:32.865 --> 06:34.264
- Exactly.
- More wine.

06:34.266 --> 06:35.699
Yeah.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:46.010 --> 06:49.446
Why aren't you dressed?

06:49.448 --> 06:51.715
I don't think I can go.

06:51.717 --> 06:53.517
Stepson duty.

06:53.519 --> 06:55.419
Hey, Griffin.

06:55.421 --> 06:58.955
His mom's out of the
country, Shep's in Chicago,

06:58.957 --> 07:02.225
and Griffin is grounded,
which means I am, too.

07:02.227 --> 07:04.261
No, no, come on, you got to go, okay?

07:04.263 --> 07:06.763
If you don't, I'm gonna be the
old creepy guy in the corner.

07:06.765 --> 07:08.398
Well, I wish I could help you out,

07:08.400 --> 07:11.601
but, like, the last time
I left him here by himself,

07:11.603 --> 07:14.304
my panty drawer was
mysteriously rearranged.

07:15.807 --> 07:18.742
Get a good whiff, pervert?

07:18.744 --> 07:20.977
It's, like, so much attitude.

07:20.979 --> 07:22.712
What about the DJ?

07:22.714 --> 07:24.548
The... what's his name? Mordekai?

07:24.550 --> 07:26.483
- Oh, my God. Malakai.
- Yes.

07:26.485 --> 07:28.251
Him. I thought
you really wanted to see him.

07:28.253 --> 07:29.419
I do.

07:32.089 --> 07:35.959
Oh, come on. There's got to be
something we can do.

07:40.097 --> 07:43.467
All right. Who's ready to party?

07:43.469 --> 07:46.903
Let's do it.

07:46.905 --> 07:49.306
Par-tay.

07:50.675 --> 07:52.676
Yeah, so it was six months later,

07:52.678 --> 07:54.244
she started having really bad headaches,

07:54.246 --> 07:56.246
and, uh, we went back for some more tests,

07:56.248 --> 08:00.283
and that's when they told us
that she had been misdiagnosed.

08:00.285 --> 08:04.254
And by the time they found
the tumors, it was too late.

08:04.256 --> 08:06.122
Wow.

08:06.124 --> 08:07.824
At least you were with
her until the end, right?

08:07.826 --> 08:09.726
Yeah, that's the thing.

08:09.728 --> 08:13.129
I left her bedside for a minute,
just to make a sandwich,

08:13.131 --> 08:16.032
and when I got back, she was gone.

08:16.034 --> 08:19.503
What kind of sandwich was it?

08:21.772 --> 08:22.939
I'm sorry?

08:25.543 --> 08:28.378
Um, I think the important thing
is that you were there for her.

08:28.380 --> 08:29.913
Yeah, g-give or take the sandwich, it's...

08:29.915 --> 08:32.349
Hey, Lina!

08:32.351 --> 08:33.783
What?

08:33.784 --> 08:35.652
Um, excuse me one second.

08:35.654 --> 08:37.654
Just keep doing what you're doing.

08:37.655 --> 08:39.289
Enjoy each other.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.691
What are you doing here?

08:41.693 --> 08:44.126
Russ mentioned that there's
some guy you want to bang,

08:44.129 --> 08:45.529
so you're having your friend do it for you.

08:45.531 --> 08:47.030
He said that?

08:47.032 --> 08:49.132
I'm paraphrasing.

08:49.134 --> 08:51.334
You need to go.

08:51.336 --> 08:53.970
Don't be like that-- I need
this as much as you do.

08:53.972 --> 08:55.071
Need what?!

08:55.073 --> 08:57.507
I am celibate, you're married.

08:57.509 --> 09:00.510
We're both living vicariously
through other people.

09:00.512 --> 09:02.512
All right, fine.

09:02.514 --> 09:05.348
You can stay, but don't blow this, okay?

09:05.350 --> 09:07.551
These are two very unhappy people,

09:07.553 --> 09:09.386
and I want the credit for
turning their lives around.

09:09.388 --> 09:10.387
It's your show.

09:10.389 --> 09:12.055
It's my show.

09:12.057 --> 09:14.057
This is my friend, AJ.

09:14.059 --> 09:15.325
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

09:15.327 --> 09:16.927
- Uh, good to meet you.
- Hi.

09:16.929 --> 09:18.929
This is Abby; she and I work together.

09:18.931 --> 09:20.764
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:20.766 --> 09:22.032
- I'm divorced.
- Oh.

09:22.034 --> 09:23.033
He's a widower.

09:23.035 --> 09:24.701
Abby.

09:24.703 --> 09:27.337
Oh, I'm so sorry for your loss.

09:27.339 --> 09:29.339
Thank you.

09:29.341 --> 09:33.443
Don't... don't ask him about the sandwich.

09:33.445 --> 09:34.911
What sandwich?

09:34.913 --> 09:36.580
The sandwich that killed his wife.

09:36.582 --> 09:37.814
- What?
- It's, like, a story.

09:37.816 --> 09:38.882
Um, I didn't get all the details.

09:38.884 --> 09:41.117
It was cancer.

09:42.587 --> 09:43.587
Yikes.

09:43.589 --> 09:45.221
What kind?

09:45.223 --> 09:47.223
Brain.

09:48.459 --> 09:50.460
- I meant what kind of sandwich.
- Uh...

09:50.462 --> 09:51.895
- Lina.
- Um...

09:51.897 --> 09:53.296
It's a valid question.

09:53.298 --> 09:55.732
I, uh, think Warren would prefer it

09:55.734 --> 09:57.601
- if we just changed the subject.
- Yeah.

09:57.603 --> 09:59.569
I get it.

09:59.571 --> 10:01.571
Just nod...

10:01.573 --> 10:03.573
if it was pastrami.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.118
I thought we were on,
like, a list or whatever.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.386
We are, it's just,

10:13.388 --> 10:15.088
a lot of people are on the list, I guess.

10:15.090 --> 10:16.756
- It's okay.
- All right.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.062
So, uh, Griffin, what grade are you in?

10:22.064 --> 10:23.563
Tenth.

10:23.565 --> 10:25.131
Cool.

10:25.133 --> 10:27.233
So... are you guys,
like, dating or something?

10:27.235 --> 10:29.969
Uh, we're just friends.

10:29.971 --> 10:31.438
Whatever.

10:31.440 --> 10:34.507
No, uh, she went to school with my sister.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.910
- Oh, right, so that's when you banged her.
- Hey.

10:36.912 --> 10:38.478
Nope. Just friends.

10:38.480 --> 10:40.780
Take it down a couple notches.
Or just put those on.

10:40.782 --> 10:42.816
I mean, it's, like, so much attitude.

10:42.818 --> 10:45.685
This is what I'm dealing with.
Oh, hey, that's Malakai.

10:48.256 --> 10:49.956
I'm sure he won't remember me.

10:49.958 --> 10:51.524
Wait, you know him?

10:51.526 --> 10:55.495
Oh, yeah, we hung out,
like, back in the day.

10:55.497 --> 10:57.163
- A while ago.
- Oh, Jess.

10:57.165 --> 10:58.164
What?

10:58.166 --> 10:59.165
Wait a minute.

10:59.167 --> 11:00.166
No.

11:00.168 --> 11:02.001
Is that why we're here?

11:02.003 --> 11:04.838
To see if some hook-up from
back in the day remembers you?

11:04.840 --> 11:07.807
I like to think I make an impression.

11:08.977 --> 11:11.010
Malakai, is that you?

11:11.012 --> 11:13.012
Yeah. Hey.

11:13.014 --> 11:14.848
Yeah, it's you.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.850
Hey, it's been a minute.

11:16.852 --> 11:19.018
Yeah, how...?

11:19.020 --> 11:22.355
Oh, from Coachella VIP tent, 2009.

11:22.357 --> 11:23.690
Right.

11:23.692 --> 11:24.824
- Cool.
- Yeah.

11:24.826 --> 11:25.892
Cool seeing you again...

11:25.894 --> 11:27.327
Jess.

11:27.329 --> 11:29.062
- Right.
- I'm Jess.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.797
Yeah.

11:30.799 --> 11:32.198
See you.

11:32.200 --> 11:33.700
Oh, go, go, go, go.

11:37.204 --> 11:38.738
Nice reunion.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.206
All right, fine.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.008
Whatever. He didn't remember me.

11:42.010 --> 11:43.209
What do I even care?

11:43.211 --> 11:44.377
I'm married.

11:44.379 --> 11:45.512
Love to be drinking, though.

11:45.514 --> 11:46.513
Now you're talking.

11:46.515 --> 11:47.881
Hey, uh...

11:47.883 --> 11:49.749
Malakai wants you to be his guest inside,

11:49.751 --> 11:51.451
so you can use these to get in.

11:51.453 --> 11:54.854
Okay, thank you. I'll be right there.

11:54.856 --> 11:57.257
Ah, it does feel good.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.691
To still have it.

11:58.693 --> 12:00.393
See ya.

12:00.495 --> 12:02.128
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

12:02.130 --> 12:03.563
No. Please.

12:03.565 --> 12:06.032
I have not been anywhere in so long.

12:06.034 --> 12:08.468
I haven't had a night like
this since Harrison was born.

12:08.470 --> 12:11.071
Yeah, you also have
a stepson, Griffin, here.

12:11.073 --> 12:12.906
He already hates me--
what's the point?

12:12.908 --> 12:15.175
Jess, no, no, no, you're
supposed to be the adult here.

12:15.177 --> 12:16.676
I am the adult right now.

12:16.678 --> 12:19.145
And I'm gonna use this to get us all in.

12:19.147 --> 12:20.513
Just don't make that face.

12:20.515 --> 12:21.715
- No.
- Don't be mean.

12:21.717 --> 12:23.350
- Come on, Jess.
- Just let me do this.

12:23.352 --> 12:25.385
Hold on.

12:26.654 --> 12:28.488
Holy shit.

12:31.058 --> 12:32.892
Wow.

12:32.894 --> 12:34.794
I'm terrible at this.

12:34.796 --> 12:36.663
Okay, so let's go back in.

12:36.665 --> 12:38.064
I don't think I can.

12:38.066 --> 12:40.066
- What? You have to.
- No, he hates me.

12:40.068 --> 12:42.702
Maybe you shouldn't have
asked about the bedsores.

12:42.704 --> 12:44.571
I just said what we were all thinking.

12:44.573 --> 12:45.905
Mmm...

12:47.274 --> 12:49.609
So, are we ditching this guy or what?

12:49.611 --> 12:52.245
No, nobody is ditching anybody.

12:52.247 --> 12:53.613
I don't know what to tell you.

12:53.615 --> 12:55.248
The guy is a real dud.

12:55.250 --> 12:57.617
I'm starting to see why
his wife committed suicide.

12:57.619 --> 12:59.252
Cancer.

12:59.254 --> 13:00.754
Well, maybe she died of boredom.

13:00.756 --> 13:02.188
- Abby.
- Sorry.

13:02.190 --> 13:04.758
I'm just having a really terrible time.

13:04.760 --> 13:06.026
We all are.

13:06.028 --> 13:08.194
- This guy sucks.
- Fine.

13:08.196 --> 13:10.430
You want to abandon him
in his time of need, go.

13:10.432 --> 13:11.865
I will take care of him.

13:11.867 --> 13:13.867
What does that mean?

13:13.869 --> 13:16.202
I'll make sure he gets home okay.

13:16.204 --> 13:18.304
Mmm.

13:23.978 --> 13:25.979
You in the mood for a sandwich?

13:25.981 --> 13:29.315
What kind of sandwich?

13:29.317 --> 13:31.317
The only sandwich.

13:33.320 --> 13:36.322
Jess, hey, it's Russ.

13:36.324 --> 13:37.991
Again.

13:37.993 --> 13:40.960
Just calling to remind you
that you have a stepson,

13:40.962 --> 13:42.796
who is right here with me.

13:42.798 --> 13:44.230
Still.

13:51.138 --> 13:53.673
I thought she was supposed to get us in.

13:53.675 --> 13:56.176
Yeah, I... I'm sure she just
got caught up, you know?

13:56.178 --> 13:58.912
They probably got a lot to talk about.

13:58.914 --> 14:02.415
Yeah, they're really talking.

14:02.417 --> 14:06.319
You know, that's not a cool way
to talk about your stepmom.

14:06.321 --> 14:09.656
Look, I already have a dad.

14:09.658 --> 14:12.592
You're right.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.463
Last week, my dad tells me it's cool

14:16.465 --> 14:19.999
that I can bring my drum set,
set it up in the garage.

14:20.001 --> 14:22.202
The next day, he's like, "Well,

14:22.204 --> 14:25.638
we think the drums
should stay at your mom's."

14:25.640 --> 14:27.373
Whatever.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.778
Really miss your drums, huh?

14:31.780 --> 14:33.780
I'm a drummer, man.

14:37.651 --> 14:39.619
Where does your mother live?

14:56.203 --> 14:58.037
Nice.

14:58.039 --> 14:59.839
Yeah, not bad for a beginner.

15:00.975 --> 15:02.742
I've played since I was seven.

15:04.211 --> 15:05.578
Yeah, no, that's...

15:05.580 --> 15:07.080
Yeah, that's what I was...

15:07.082 --> 15:09.082
Yeah, it sounded good.

15:15.386 --> 15:16.820
Sorry. Hope this is okay.

15:16.822 --> 15:18.221
Should only take a minute.

15:18.223 --> 15:19.656
Where are we?

15:22.692 --> 15:25.527
Um, but... so what are we...?

15:27.163 --> 15:29.164
What... Okay.

15:30.767 --> 15:32.201
Well, wait up.

15:33.270 --> 15:34.670
I-I know this is weird.

15:34.672 --> 15:36.472
I just like to come by here every day

15:36.474 --> 15:37.873
- and, you know...
- Um...

15:37.875 --> 15:39.875
- ...say hi.
- Yeah.

15:39.877 --> 15:41.777
What, you come every day?

15:41.779 --> 15:43.379
- I try.
- Wow.

15:43.381 --> 15:44.780
You sure you don't mind?

15:44.782 --> 15:47.083
No, it's totally fine.

15:47.085 --> 15:48.684
You know, a lot of women
are actually attracted

15:48.686 --> 15:50.152
to the whole widower thing.

15:51.621 --> 15:53.356
It's almost like they get off on it.

15:53.358 --> 15:54.457
Really?

15:54.459 --> 15:57.326
You know what I miss the most?

15:57.328 --> 16:00.129
The boring shit.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.530
The everyday nothing.

16:01.532 --> 16:03.899
I love boring shit.

16:03.901 --> 16:06.235
My husband's boring.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.970
I mean, you know, he's regular.

16:07.972 --> 16:10.573
He's...

16:10.575 --> 16:12.475
He's great.

16:19.049 --> 16:21.884
Are you sure you guys
don't want to be alone?

16:21.886 --> 16:24.754
No, it's okay.

16:24.756 --> 16:27.423
She just told me she likes you.

16:28.892 --> 16:32.328
She... seems cool.

16:37.234 --> 16:39.668
Whoa.

16:39.670 --> 16:42.071
So, probably shouldn't tell your dad

16:42.073 --> 16:43.706
about what happened at the party.

16:43.708 --> 16:47.009
My dad's old. He's not stupid.

16:47.011 --> 16:49.712
Why do you
think he married such a slut?

16:49.714 --> 16:51.247
- Hey.
- Sorry.

16:51.249 --> 16:54.350
So, uh, why do you think
he married such a...

16:54.352 --> 16:55.918
free spirit?

16:55.920 --> 16:58.921
Well...

16:58.923 --> 17:01.557
Jess...

17:01.559 --> 17:04.593
uh, she can be a lot of fun.

17:04.595 --> 17:06.462
Glad I'm not married to her.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.532
Me, too.

17:10.535 --> 17:13.269
I thought you were her buddy.

17:14.570 --> 17:19.407
Yeah, but I don't know.

17:19.410 --> 17:22.611
I feel like you never want
to marry someone that's too fun.

17:23.713 --> 17:26.082
Yeah, I'll try to remember that.

17:29.386 --> 17:30.586
Oh, shit.

17:30.588 --> 17:31.720
They're here.

17:31.722 --> 17:32.721
Who is here?

17:32.723 --> 17:34.123
Renters.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.724
This place is rented?

17:35.726 --> 17:36.725
House swap.

17:36.727 --> 17:38.127
My mom's in Dusseldorf.

17:38.129 --> 17:40.696
Not again.

17:40.698 --> 17:42.131
We give you the warning last time.

17:42.133 --> 17:43.732
And this time, we call the police.

17:43.734 --> 17:45.234
Whoa, guys.

17:45.236 --> 17:46.235
Hold on, all right?

17:46.237 --> 17:47.470
Look, let's relax, okay?

17:47.472 --> 17:49.905
Uh, before you call the cops...

17:51.341 --> 17:52.808
Get out of here!

17:52.810 --> 17:55.244
And take your young lover somewhere else!

18:00.418 --> 18:01.750
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

18:01.752 --> 18:03.452
Mmm. Mm-mmm.

18:03.454 --> 18:04.787
Mm-hmm.

18:04.789 --> 18:06.188
Right? What'd I tell you?

18:06.190 --> 18:07.890
Oh, my God, it's so good.

18:07.892 --> 18:09.291
- Mmm.
- Like, how do they do it?

18:09.293 --> 18:10.860
The meat? What is it?

18:10.862 --> 18:11.861
The meat.

18:11.863 --> 18:14.296
- Well...
- Mmm.

18:14.298 --> 18:16.132
this I want more of.

18:16.134 --> 18:17.666
Better than sex.

18:17.668 --> 18:20.369
Totally.

18:20.371 --> 18:22.771
And just like it.

18:37.053 --> 18:38.888
Ooh.

18:40.490 --> 18:42.491
I'm celibate, by the way.

18:45.162 --> 18:47.296
But we could do other shit.

18:49.866 --> 18:51.867
I could watch you.

19:01.745 --> 19:03.746
The Larsens.

19:05.415 --> 19:08.250
What about 'em?

19:08.252 --> 19:10.252
That's who I would swing with.

19:10.254 --> 19:12.087
Oh.

19:12.089 --> 19:14.089
Okay.

19:14.091 --> 19:15.824
What's so great about Nick Larsen?

19:15.826 --> 19:17.560
He's the most like you.

19:17.562 --> 19:19.562
That's sweet.
