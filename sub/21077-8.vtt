00:31.222 --> 00:33.189
Man, these rappers have so
many diamonds in their mouth,

00:33.191 --> 00:34.890
you can't understand
anything they're saying.

00:34.892 --> 00:36.192
That's why it's called music.

00:36.194 --> 00:39.328
Yeah, it ain't about the lyrics,
it's about the emotion.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.163
Lyrics is for white people anyways.

00:41.165 --> 00:44.233
You under-educated negroes,
and Milk, sadden me.

00:44.235 --> 00:45.901
You guys are perpetuating stereotypes

00:45.903 --> 00:47.903
by listening to this bogus
mumble rap.

00:47.905 --> 00:49.989
This is exactly why my
group Afroanonymous has been

00:49.990 --> 00:52.074
working around the globe
to make black lives matter.

00:52.076 --> 00:53.509
Man, why you always
[bleep] up my high

00:53.511 --> 00:56.946
with all that positive "black
people can do better" bullshit?

00:56.948 --> 00:59.415
Yeah, you Steve Harvey-ass nig.

00:59.417 --> 01:02.084
You talk a big game with
all that militant mumbo-jumbo,

01:02.086 --> 01:04.153
but what have you done
besides pay the rent?

01:04.155 --> 01:07.156
- And stock the fridge?
- And pay child support?

01:07.158 --> 01:09.024
Well, a Commandant from
the Congo was so impressed

01:09.026 --> 01:11.461
by my Twitter hashtags
that he wants my help

01:11.462 --> 01:14.029
overthrowing an evil dictator.
So I'm going to Africa.

01:14.031 --> 01:17.099
Little nigga, you eight!
You can't just decide to go to Africa!

01:17.101 --> 01:18.968
Who gon' take care of
me nigga, damn!?

01:18.970 --> 01:20.569
This is the opportunity of a lifetime:

01:20.571 --> 01:22.504
a chance to go to the cradle
of civilization,

01:22.506 --> 01:25.374
- the source of humanity, the motherland...
- Wapeye's?

01:25.376 --> 01:26.875
Do you guys hear me?

01:26.877 --> 01:29.211
I'm gonna go do something
Malcolm, Martin, and Spike Lee

01:29.213 --> 01:32.403
could never do:
I'm gonna save Africa.

01:33.484 --> 01:36.285

01:49.200 --> 01:50.499
at the crib by yourselves.

01:50.501 --> 01:52.434
Yeah, me neither.
That's neglectful.

01:52.436 --> 01:54.903
But hold up,

01:54.905 --> 01:56.105

02:05.583 --> 02:09.384
Now that I have your attention,
I have bad news, guys.

Due to a debatable

Uncle Sam put a boot on my house.
So there's no party.

02:14.992 --> 02:16.191
That sucks.

02:16.193 --> 02:17.860
Now what are we gonna do?

02:17.862 --> 02:21.163
Aw, man, I was gonna get my
V-card punched at that party.

02:21.165 --> 02:23.499

02:23.501 --> 02:25.334
Cindy was finna let us smash.

02:25.336 --> 02:27.870

- Shotgun!

02:27.872 --> 02:29.538
Don't you see this THOTportunity?

02:29.540 --> 02:31.140
We need to throw our own party.

02:31.142 --> 02:33.542
I don't know, my nigs.
My place is in the hood.

02:33.544 --> 02:35.377
The only parties that
go down on my block

02:35.379 --> 02:37.579
- is search parties.
- True dat, but whoever throws

02:37.581 --> 02:40.149

02:40.151 --> 02:42.584
And you know with that
home court advantage,

02:42.586 --> 02:44.586

to your bed

02:44.588 --> 02:48.257
- and show her your temperpenis.
- Ooh, Cindy and Grover...

02:48.259 --> 02:50.860
Uh, maybe I should have the
party, because, you know,

02:50.861 --> 02:53.462
that's what popular
students are supposed to do.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.230
And I'm the most
popular guy here,

03:19.459 --> 03:22.057
We're in Africa.
Isn't this great?

03:22.393 --> 03:25.227
You're right.
We should just take it all in.

03:26.564 --> 03:29.565
And who are you?
You cannot be one of my warriors.

03:29.567 --> 03:31.567
Your chest is small,
your skin is soft,

03:31.569 --> 03:33.569
and you have both of your
arms and feet.

03:33.571 --> 03:36.238
- I'm Malik from Afroanonymous.
- Who? Oh, yes.

03:36.240 --> 03:39.074
The American revolutionary
that gives good hashtags.

03:39.076 --> 03:41.877
- You stay, how you say, "woke."
- That's me.

03:42.019 --> 03:44.086
As you were told, a powerful evil

03:44.088 --> 03:46.588
has descended upon the great
continent of Africa,

03:46.590 --> 03:48.257
corrupting the minds of the people

03:48.259 --> 03:50.726
with its juvenile, ghetto,
and questionable antics.

03:50.728 --> 03:52.694
Its ratchetry knows no bounds.

03:52.696 --> 03:56.331
We will require your great war
strategies to conquer it.

03:56.333 --> 03:58.200
Madea?!
She's a fictitious character.

03:58.202 --> 04:01.436
No, no, no.
Tyler Perry is the fictitious one.

04:01.438 --> 04:03.138
Madea is very real.

04:03.140 --> 04:05.507
Sometimes she likes to dress
as a straight man.

04:05.509 --> 04:07.109
She needs to be destroyed.

04:07.111 --> 04:09.044
Wow, you want me
to take out Madea?

04:09.046 --> 04:12.281
I won't just be saving Africa.
I'll be saving all of Black culture!

04:12.283 --> 04:14.349
Ha, ha!

04:53.554 --> 04:55.854
Apparently "Flo-Rida's" in town again.

04:55.856 --> 04:59.291

05:12.506 --> 05:14.506
Aye, don't just stand there

Hand your Crip one of them

05:16.343 --> 05:18.543
And not the red one, caa.

05:18.545 --> 05:20.479
<i>Aye!</i>

05:23.383 --> 05:25.183
Nigga, you ain't got
nothing on these.

05:25.185 --> 05:26.284
Ugh!

05:28.462 --> 05:30.729
Montrel and his boys
are eating all our eats

05:30.731 --> 05:32.597
and drinking all our drinks.

05:32.599 --> 05:34.399
There's not a chip left in the house.

05:34.401 --> 05:36.468
The party's finna start,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.336

05:38.338 --> 05:40.338
Or worse, give 'em

05:40.340 --> 05:42.908
Everybody calm down.
I got an idea.

05:44.811 --> 05:46.278
Yo.

05:46.280 --> 05:50.015
Hey, Montrel, guess who

05:50.017 --> 05:52.450

Why does every Brillo pad head
mutha[bleep] wanna kill me?

07:02.933 --> 07:06.601
Lee Daniels, Stedman Graham,
and for some reason,

07:06.603 --> 07:10.738
the delectable Odell Beckham, Jr.
I don't know what I do to him.

07:10.740 --> 07:14.809
Oh, wait, now I remember.
I'm so bad.

07:14.811 --> 07:17.445
So look, nigga baby,

titties in your face?

07:41.451 --> 07:42.850
Yeah, what kind of host is you?

07:42.852 --> 07:44.419

07:58.034 --> 08:02.277

08:45.181 --> 08:46.914

08:46.916 --> 08:48.950
You know Flo-Rida's in town.

08:48.952 --> 08:51.285
Flo-Rida, you here for real?
You ain't her period.

08:51.287 --> 08:54.022

Hello? Shit!

Mmm, okay.

<i>- Yeah!
- Okay.</i>

10:16.139 --> 10:17.538
Damn, Grover.

10:17.540 --> 10:19.741
I didn't know you could
throw a party like this.

10:19.743 --> 10:21.542
I can do a lot of things
you don't know about.

10:21.544 --> 10:24.011
Oh, yeah?
Like what?

10:26.015 --> 10:28.483
Grover, my nig.
I really need your help.

10:28.485 --> 10:31.152
I know what you about to ask,
and the answer is no.

10:31.154 --> 10:32.787
I'm about to take
Cindy to my room,

10:32.789 --> 10:35.256
so you gonna have to roll
Medina's big ass to the garage.

10:35.258 --> 10:36.824
It's not that.
It's just...

10:36.826 --> 10:40.528
- Hey, man, I'm working right now.
- Dis nigga!

10:44.601 --> 10:45.800
Well, that's just great.

10:45.802 --> 10:47.401
I guess we're not
shutting the party down.

10:47.403 --> 10:48.636
Let's just go home and jerk off.

10:48.638 --> 10:50.438
Whose house this time?
Yours?

10:50.440 --> 10:52.673
Yours?
Who's with me?

10:52.675 --> 10:54.175
ManWeAlwaysJerkOff

10:54.177 --> 10:55.643
I'mTryingToGetAllTheStains
OffTheCouch.

10:55.645 --> 10:57.875
You got a better idea?

10:59.516 --> 11:01.716
<i>Oh, shit, what happened
to the lights?</i>

11:01.718 --> 11:04.519
<i>Oh, shit, Montrel's here!
He gon' kill me!</i>

11:04.521 --> 11:06.554
<i>Sorry.
Damn. My bad.</i>

11:06.556 --> 11:08.523
<i>Oh, girl, you got
some big-ass titties.</i>

11:08.525 --> 11:10.992
<i>- Aye, man, [bleep] you.
- Sorry 'bout that.</i>

11:10.994 --> 11:14.462
<i>Now what?
I hope Malik paid the electric bill.</i>

11:14.464 --> 11:15.930
<i>Well, too bad it's dark.</i>

11:15.932 --> 11:17.832
<i>I was ready to see what
you was working with.</i>

11:17.834 --> 11:20.868
<i>Oh, word?
I'll be right back.</i>

11:20.870 --> 11:24.672
- You got a saboteur, my nig. 
- Randy bitch ass.

11:24.674 --> 11:26.374
Well, we got to get
these lights back on,

11:26.376 --> 11:29.377
or this going down as the most
un-legendary party in history.

11:29.379 --> 11:31.879
I know. Malik's trap
house, he got a generator.

11:31.881 --> 11:34.949
Let us handle that. You go
warm up Cindy's THOT pot.

11:38.321 --> 11:41.189
"A place where even dreams believe."
That makes no sense.

11:41.191 --> 11:42.256
Ain't got to make no sense.

11:42.258 --> 11:44.025
It was written by
the man/woman himself.

11:44.027 --> 11:45.626
Logic is her kryptonite.

11:45.628 --> 11:47.028
Wait a minute,
you're Michael Jai White.

11:47.030 --> 11:49.130
Uh, who?
Oh, yeah, that's me.

11:54.370 --> 11:57.171
Riiight. Michael Jai
White, you were Spawn,

11:57.173 --> 11:59.106
and that cool gangster dude
in "The Dark Knight."

11:59.108 --> 12:01.375
You've been in about 4,000
straight-to-DVD movies.

12:01.377 --> 12:02.543
What happened to you, brother?

12:02.545 --> 12:04.946
I busted my ass
learning karate and shit,

12:04.948 --> 12:07.181
but Hollywood don't want
no strong black man.

12:07.183 --> 12:09.717
They want half-men
like Omar Gooding.

12:09.719 --> 12:11.118
Come on, man, you know she's evil.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.054
She destroyed the minds
of black people in America.

12:13.056 --> 12:14.789
Now she's trying to turn
Africa into Atlanta.

12:14.791 --> 12:16.991
Aflantica?
Zulus in high heels?

12:16.993 --> 12:18.626
Hey, man, stop making me think.

12:18.628 --> 12:20.628
As long as I can get paid
and take care of my family,

12:20.630 --> 12:23.431
I don't give a [bleep].

12:26.203 --> 12:28.169
A'ight, let's go back in.

12:28.171 --> 12:31.339
Uh, that's okay. Uh, I'ma
just chill in the trap house.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.975
This the party of the year.
All those drunk breezies in there,

12:33.977 --> 12:35.409
and you gonna hide in the treehouse?

12:35.411 --> 12:38.980
Uh, yeah, you know me.
I stay hittin' the trees.

12:38.982 --> 12:40.314
What the [bleep] is up with you?

12:40.316 --> 12:42.516
Montrel found out I was
the one that called him.

12:42.518 --> 12:45.186
- He said he's gonna kill me.
- Man, we homies.

12:45.188 --> 12:47.622
We ain't finna just let Montrel
beat the brakes off you.

12:47.624 --> 12:49.957
- We got yo back.
<i>- This party's turnt.</i>

12:49.959 --> 12:51.559
<i>What happened to my panties?</i>

12:51.561 --> 12:53.594
You understand I
got to leave you, right?

12:53.596 --> 12:56.397
It ain't personal.
It's pussy.

12:59.435 --> 13:02.632
Now, where were we?

13:03.773 --> 13:06.374
Where's my begotten Scrilla seed?!

13:06.376 --> 13:07.808
- Oh, shit.
- Ohhh!

13:07.810 --> 13:10.378
- Who dat?
- Cindy, nigga. Come on, now.

13:10.380 --> 13:14.395
- Uh, she ain't here, Pastor.
- If I find out you lying,

13:14.439 --> 13:17.989
Milky Toast, I'ma kill
everybody in this mutha[bleep].

13:18.024 --> 13:19.997
O-oh, Lord.

13:20.173 --> 13:23.028
- Now where is she?!
- If my dad finds out I'm here,

13:23.063 --> 13:24.791
I'll be grounded till
Jesus comes back.

13:24.946 --> 13:26.326
I'll never experience my
first time having sex,

13:26.328 --> 13:28.061
my first time turning down anal,

13:28.063 --> 13:30.030
my first time
saying yes to anal.

13:30.032 --> 13:32.599
- Don't worry, I got you.
- You know, Grover,

13:32.601 --> 13:34.334
most guys woulda got
the hell out of here.

13:34.336 --> 13:36.603
But you a real one.
If he's gonna kill you,

13:36.605 --> 13:39.573
the least I can do
is give you a hug.

13:39.575 --> 13:44.578
- Damn, is that you or the broom?
- God, I hope it's me.

13:44.580 --> 13:47.014
Now look, Cindy ain't here,
buster-ass Scrilla.

13:47.016 --> 13:48.549
I heard she was
at a friend's house...

13:48.551 --> 13:51.251
either reading the Bible or
exploring their bodies and shit.

13:51.253 --> 13:54.321
So to answer your question,
nah, homey, she ain't here.

13:54.323 --> 13:57.391
Well, I'm predisposed
to trust all White people.

13:59.929 --> 14:01.328
Man, you a hero.

14:01.330 --> 14:03.263
I'm surprised he didn't
scare the shit out of you.

14:03.265 --> 14:05.359
Ain't nothing to a legend.

14:09.101 --> 14:10.567
<i>'Allo, Malik.</i>

14:10.569 --> 14:12.302
- Who are you?
- I'm Idris Elba.

14:12.304 --> 14:14.137
- This is Blair Underwood.
- What's up?

14:14.139 --> 14:17.674
- Chap over there is Mike Epps.
- Man, I'm here for the weed.

14:17.676 --> 14:19.476
Look, we heard Michael Jai White

14:19.478 --> 14:21.545
talking to you, and we
want to help you out.

14:21.547 --> 14:22.913
That's great.
Thank you, my brothers.

14:22.915 --> 14:25.248
But if you could help me
escape, why are you still here?

14:25.250 --> 14:27.451
Oh, no, mate,
we're not locked up.

14:27.453 --> 14:30.521
We've all done shitty Madea
movies, and we're hiding until

14:30.522 --> 14:33.590
that shit blows over and we
can start getting roles again.

14:33.592 --> 14:37.627
- Man, I'm here for the weed.
- Right. Okay, so how do I get out?

14:37.629 --> 14:41.003
Blair, will you do the honors, mate?

14:41.333 --> 14:44.401
You have to kill Madea.
Then maybe we can stop hiding.

14:44.403 --> 14:46.203
Damn, I miss working
with white people.

14:46.205 --> 14:48.038
I promise.
Stay up, my brothers.

14:48.040 --> 14:49.740
<i>Peace, Malik.</i>

14:55.714 --> 14:56.813
Hey, Commandant...

14:56.815 --> 14:58.882
Malik!
You scared me, nigga.

14:58.884 --> 15:00.384
Please announce yourself
next time.

15:00.386 --> 15:03.286
- Have you killed the Evil One yet?
- I was on my way to him-her now.

15:03.288 --> 15:05.956
- What's with all the fireworks?
- For the new diamond mine.

15:05.958 --> 15:08.759
- Diamond mines?
- Yes. And once you kill Madea,

15:08.761 --> 15:11.361
we will take over her land
and all of her employees.

15:11.363 --> 15:13.230
With no more shitty
movies to make,

15:13.232 --> 15:15.699
they will have no choice
but to work for me.

15:15.701 --> 15:17.034
That's what this is all about!

15:17.036 --> 15:18.902
Using black people
to mine your diamonds.

15:18.904 --> 15:21.605
Absolutely. With the recent
rise of Mumble Rap,

15:21.607 --> 15:23.040
my business is booming.

15:23.042 --> 15:25.142
My plan is to put
diamonds in the mouth

15:25.144 --> 15:26.910
of every nigga in America.

15:26.912 --> 15:30.180
We will never understand
a rap lyric ever again.

15:30.182 --> 15:33.383
Who knows, maybe Fetty Wap
will become president.

15:33.385 --> 15:35.285
♪ Diamonds and chicken ♪

15:36.855 --> 15:39.623
Oh, my God.
You are worse than Madea!

15:39.625 --> 15:42.325
I will not participate in
the degradation of my people.

15:42.327 --> 15:44.494
Oh, you will...
or you die.

15:45.798 --> 15:48.917
Okay, okay.
I'll do it.

15:52.938 --> 15:55.338
ManPleaseExplainToMeWhy
WeGivingTheShitCrewAllThisBeer

15:55.340 --> 15:56.440
WhenWeShouldBe[bleep]EmUp.

15:56.442 --> 15:58.475
You see, Mumblemouth,
when you roll a keg,

15:58.477 --> 16:00.977
it fills up with foam
and explodes... boom!

16:00.979 --> 16:03.914
Bye-bye, Shit Crew party.

16:03.916 --> 16:06.043
Oh, shit!

16:07.352 --> 16:09.086
What the [bleep]
is y'all doing here?

16:09.088 --> 16:10.720
We still full up on dicks.

16:10.722 --> 16:13.657
But actually... aye, y'all,
do we need any assholes?

16:13.659 --> 16:15.792
<i>- No.
- Nope, all good.</i>

16:15.794 --> 16:19.029
You're right.
We were assholes.

16:19.031 --> 16:21.598
But we brought you this
to make up for it.

16:21.600 --> 16:24.968
Well, we is a little low on drank.
Bring it in.

16:24.970 --> 16:26.970
Hey, anybody want a "brewski"?

16:26.972 --> 16:30.585
Grover, I'll let you do the honors.

16:36.348 --> 16:38.248
Noooo!

16:42.354 --> 16:45.288
I saved the party.
Legends!

16:48.861 --> 16:50.894
Damn, the house is jacked.

16:50.896 --> 16:53.396
Malik ain't never gonna let me
stay home alone again.

16:53.398 --> 16:55.932
Ha, ha! House ruined!
Party's over!

16:55.934 --> 16:57.334
You're gonna go home
and get in trouble

16:57.336 --> 16:59.936
for smelling like beer.

16:59.938 --> 17:02.639
He's right.
We better take our clothes off.

17:02.641 --> 17:03.707
Whoo!

17:09.647 --> 17:13.951
Shh, don't fight it.
Just let it happen.

17:17.356 --> 17:19.923
<i>Cut, cut, cut!
You call that acting?!</i>

17:19.925 --> 17:22.192
But Madea, we ain't got no scripts.

17:22.194 --> 17:25.060
Ohhh, "I ain't got no script."

17:25.063 --> 17:27.164
- Execute him.
- Hwah!

17:27.165 --> 17:29.533
Hold up.
Ain't nobody dying today.

17:29.535 --> 17:32.135
Nigga baby!
How did you get out?

17:32.137 --> 17:33.803
Now's not the time,
Mr. Mrs. Madea.

17:33.805 --> 17:35.539
I need you to come with me
if you want to live.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.474
Look, so maybe you don't
make the best films,

17:37.476 --> 17:39.376
but you employ thousands
of people.

17:39.378 --> 17:41.878
I mean, you don't pay 'em nothing,
and health care's non-existent,

17:41.880 --> 17:43.914
but you give 'em opportunity,
and you give 'em hope.

17:43.916 --> 17:46.583
You're a necessary evil,
which is why I must save you.

17:46.585 --> 17:49.686
- From who now?
- Me, that's who.

17:49.688 --> 17:54.524
Hmm. What does this delicious,
rugged Hersey nigga want?

17:54.526 --> 17:57.827
"This delicious, rugged Hersey nigga"
wants you dead.

17:57.829 --> 18:00.797
- Prepare to die.
- This is gonna happen.

18:00.799 --> 18:02.832
In about 30 seconds,
there'll be a huge explosion.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.401
You'll be startled by it,
and that'll allow me

18:04.403 --> 18:06.670
to kick you in the shin,
go into a back flip,

18:06.672 --> 18:07.938
whose momentum will
carry me and Madea

18:07.940 --> 18:10.540
into a nearby river,
escaping the fiery carnage.

18:10.542 --> 18:12.946
Yeah, right.

18:15.247 --> 18:18.748
I've got that Danny Glover looking
mutha[bleep] locked at six o'clock!

18:18.750 --> 18:20.951
Nobody [bleep] with
the homey and lives!

18:20.953 --> 18:23.620
So you get a bomb,
and you get a bomb,

18:23.622 --> 18:25.922
and you get a bomb!

18:27.960 --> 18:29.392
Ha, ha!

18:34.299 --> 18:38.335
Apocalyptic, zombie Jesus.
Thank you, God, for saving me.

18:38.337 --> 18:41.671
You know what?
I owe for saving me, nigga...

18:41.673 --> 18:45.742
I mean Malik.
Whatever you want, it is yours.

18:45.744 --> 18:47.410
Can you stop making
those bad movies?

18:47.412 --> 18:49.713
<i>All that money I make, honey?</i>

18:49.715 --> 18:53.014
<i>Get the [bleep] outta here.
Hellur!</i>

18:57.727 --> 19:00.261
First you steal my party,
then my girl.

19:00.263 --> 19:02.129
Now I'm gonna steal
your asshole.

19:02.131 --> 19:03.464
Prepare to get fisted!

19:03.466 --> 19:05.099
<i>Huh?</i>

19:05.101 --> 19:06.200
Y-Y-You know what I mean.

19:06.202 --> 19:08.436
I'm gonna beat him up.
[bleep] all of you!

19:08.438 --> 19:10.755
Night, night, Shit Crew!

19:10.840 --> 19:12.339
Aye, yo, hold on, little bitch.

19:12.341 --> 19:14.375
You think you 'bout to Ike Turner
my little brother?

19:14.377 --> 19:16.143
'Trel the only nigga
to hit that nigga.

19:16.145 --> 19:18.979
But I do get to hit you, caa.

19:18.981 --> 19:22.483
- Y'all wanna catch this fade too?
- AbsolutelyNot.

19:22.485 --> 19:25.219
Aye, check this out.
The party's over!

19:26.222 --> 19:28.456
Aye, hold up.
Where the [bleep] y'all going?

19:28.458 --> 19:30.057
Y'all little niggas
better get to cleaning.

19:30.059 --> 19:32.026
And I want it to be
spotless in this bitch.

19:34.363 --> 19:36.096
You know, you don't have
to stay and do this.

19:36.098 --> 19:39.266
It's the least I can do
since my dad almost killed you.

19:39.268 --> 19:43.045
Huh, I guess it wasn't the broom.

19:43.072 --> 19:46.140
- Aw, come on, bruh.
- Oh, hell naw.

19:46.142 --> 19:49.176
Flo-Rida's the only nigga
that's getting ass tonight.

19:49.178 --> 19:50.511
Now get to sweepin'.

19:52.982 --> 19:56.517
Aye, 'Trel. I'm sorry for sending
you on that wild hoe chase.

19:56.519 --> 19:57.718
Aye, don't sweat it, Grover.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.655
If you can't lie to your family,
who can you lie to?

20:01.657 --> 20:03.924
Now let me show you
something else families do.

20:03.926 --> 20:06.861
- We give ass whoopin's.
- Uh! Ow, buster.

20:06.863 --> 20:08.762
What's up, negroes?
I'm home.

20:08.764 --> 20:10.064
- Malik?
- Daddy!

20:10.066 --> 20:12.733
Calm down, calm down.
I'm glad to see y'all too.

20:12.735 --> 20:14.978
Did you get us anything, Daddy?

20:15.371 --> 20:17.505
Why are there ashes on the shirts?

20:17.507 --> 20:20.474
Yeah, why it smell like
cocoa butter and napalm?

20:20.476 --> 20:21.842
Aye, you want the shirts or what?

20:21.844 --> 20:23.444
- Yeah.
- Thanks, my nigga.

20:23.446 --> 20:26.881
- Where my shirt at, caa?
- Wow, the house looks clean.

20:26.883 --> 20:28.516
I guess you guys can be responsible.

20:28.518 --> 20:31.619
- How was Africa?
- Let's just say, nothing's changed.

20:31.621 --> 20:33.787
Uh, you might want to leave the room.

20:33.789 --> 20:37.391
I'm about to watch this new
Madea joint, "Madea Unchained."

20:37.393 --> 20:39.760
It's the one with bad acting
and has no script.

20:39.762 --> 20:41.495
Scoot over.

20:41.497 --> 20:46.033
<i>- Who is that nigga on that nag?
- Hellur!</i>

20:46.035 --> 20:49.603
Aye, may not be that funny,
but at least my people are working.

20:49.605 --> 20:51.572
Man, I'm here for the weed.
