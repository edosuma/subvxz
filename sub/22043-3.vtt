00:00.160 --> 00:02.910
(dramatic music)

00:04.220 --> 00:06.840
- I'm visiting a historic
town in West Virginia

00:07.830 --> 00:10.040
where I meet one of
the most bizarre owners

00:10.040 --> 00:12.000
I've ever encountered.

00:12.000 --> 00:14.960
Just like Hoarders Anonymous,
junk on top of junk.

00:14.960 --> 00:17.350
Not only is she unaware of
the damage she has done...

00:17.350 --> 00:19.970
The wall's rotten, and you're
just gonna paint over it?

00:19.970 --> 00:20.803
- It's really solid.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.450
- You can't just Band-Aid this place.

00:22.450 --> 00:25.191
But her unwillingness to
change or even listen.

00:25.191 --> 00:26.670
(dramatic music)

00:26.670 --> 00:27.760
You're boiling a burger?

00:27.760 --> 00:28.810
- I eat them often.

00:28.810 --> 00:31.350
- We're all pretending that this is good.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.430
Proves to be the biggest hurdle for me.

00:33.430 --> 00:34.830
You are seriously in denial.

00:39.344 --> 00:41.927
(bright music)

00:50.060 --> 00:52.390
Just 60 miles from Washington, D.C.

00:52.390 --> 00:55.770
is one of America's most
celebrated small towns,

00:55.770 --> 00:56.763
Harpers Ferry.

01:00.080 --> 01:03.390
Situated between the beautiful
Potomac and Shenandoah rivers

01:03.390 --> 01:05.290
is the Town's Inn.

01:05.290 --> 01:09.730
- My wife Ana and I bought the
inn from my mom back in 2007.

01:09.730 --> 01:10.960
We want it to be a good investment,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.280
but we also bought it more
with our hearts than our heads.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.760
I think it's the type
of woman who's happiest

01:14.760 --> 01:15.593
when she's working,

01:15.593 --> 01:17.930
so we figured this would be
a good place for her to work

01:17.930 --> 01:21.430
and enjoy the season
of life that she's in.

01:21.430 --> 01:24.770
- I'm a grandmother, so it's
kind of "grandmother's house."

01:24.770 --> 01:28.830
And I'm here mainly because
I've retired from teaching.

01:28.830 --> 01:31.050
I love historical properties

01:31.050 --> 01:32.870
and decided that being an innkeeper

01:32.870 --> 01:35.120
would be a fun thing
for the rest of my life.

01:39.280 --> 01:42.360
- The Town's Inn is probably
kind of like a circus.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.610
Karan's the ringleader,

01:43.610 --> 01:45.830
and you never know
what's gonna happen next.

01:45.830 --> 01:49.830
- Working for Karan is
interesting, it's frustrating.

01:49.830 --> 01:52.040
She's pretty set in her ways.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.480
And it's her way or the highway.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.310
- I think what makes someone a good mom

01:56.310 --> 01:58.480
isn't necessarily what
makes someone a good boss

01:58.480 --> 01:59.700
or a good business owner.

01:59.700 --> 02:03.760
- Karan, as a businesswoman,
she don't have no experience.

02:03.760 --> 02:05.083
And that's awful.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.770
- Karan treats this place as
both her business and her home,

02:11.770 --> 02:14.000
but more her home.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.810
I mean, her bedroom is in her office.

02:16.810 --> 02:18.530
You know, she sleeps right there,

02:18.530 --> 02:20.760
pretty much in the dining room.

02:20.760 --> 02:23.150
- I have asked Karan, "Is this your home

02:23.150 --> 02:25.370
or a restaurant or is it a inn?"

02:25.370 --> 02:29.620
You can't have it all three
ways and expect to make money.

02:29.620 --> 02:31.730
- Karan is absolutely a hoarder.

02:31.730 --> 02:36.060
Karan hoards her clothes,
old shoes, books, baskets.

02:36.060 --> 02:38.890
- Don't even get me started
on those damn baskets.

02:38.890 --> 02:40.520
There's baskets everywhere.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.930
You could open a closet in the hotel room

02:41.930 --> 02:43.170
and could see a pile of baskets.

02:43.170 --> 02:45.110
You could walk in our server
area, open the fridge,

02:45.110 --> 02:46.610
and I bet there'd be a basket there,

02:46.610 --> 02:48.460
because they're literally everywhere.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.920
- Karan's in denial of what's wrong.

02:54.920 --> 02:57.470
She needs to separate
herself from this place,

02:57.470 --> 02:59.760
or things aren't gonna change.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.250
- We are suffering, we are in debt,

03:02.250 --> 03:04.490
and the customers are going away.

03:04.490 --> 03:06.460
- While we don't want
to sell the Town's Inn,

03:06.460 --> 03:09.027
I think we're certainly at
a crossroads of just saying,

03:09.027 --> 03:11.710
"Is this becoming
overwhelming for my mom?"

03:11.710 --> 03:13.420
You know, she's not getting any younger,

03:13.420 --> 03:15.670
and it just could be a
potential train wreck.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.470
So if the ship is sinking,
then we want to make sure

03:20.470 --> 03:23.403
we get our mom off of
the boat before it sinks.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.093
(bright music)

03:35.270 --> 03:37.183
- Wow, look at this place, gorgeous.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.953
Fresh food, wow.

03:41.060 --> 03:42.440
Nice to see you.
- I'm Karan Townsend.

03:42.440 --> 03:44.367
- Karan, good to see you.
- I'm glad you're here.

03:44.367 --> 03:45.740
- My, what a gorgeous little town.

03:45.740 --> 03:46.573
- Does it remind you of Europe?

03:46.573 --> 03:48.245
Isn't it kind of the quaint village?

03:48.245 --> 03:49.547
- It reminds me of a movie set.

03:49.547 --> 03:50.534
I mean, it's just literally--

03:50.534 --> 03:51.367
- It's been used as that many times.

03:51.367 --> 03:52.920
- Has it really, wow.
- Yeah.

03:52.920 --> 03:54.630
- [Gordon] Okay, let me just
have a quick look 'round,

03:54.630 --> 03:56.600
and, yeah, I'll follow you.
- Okay.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.150
- Um, what's all this
out here, what is that?

03:59.150 --> 04:00.650
Oh, that's just for watering the plants.

04:00.650 --> 04:02.490
- Yeah, and we get a lot of hikers.

04:02.490 --> 04:05.088
- Wow.
- And it rains here sometimes.

04:05.088 --> 04:06.138
- What is this?

04:06.138 --> 04:07.973
- Who knows? It's been here a long time.

04:07.973 --> 04:09.968
- It looks just like Freddy Krueger's hat.

04:09.968 --> 04:11.493
- It could be.
- Whose is this?

04:11.493 --> 04:13.493
- It's just there for anybody
that wants to borrow it.

04:13.493 --> 04:15.704
- Oh, I see. And does
anyone borrow that, Karan?

04:15.704 --> 04:17.089
No.
- They haven't yet.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.339
- Interesting.

04:18.339 --> 04:20.660
Another one as well and what, are these?

04:20.660 --> 04:22.810
- They're all for sale.
- Oh, they're for sale.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.990
- Yeah, see, summer hats.

04:24.990 --> 04:26.220
- How much are these?

04:26.220 --> 04:30.200
- Three to 20, depends.
- Three, and this is how much?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.560
- Uh, maybe not more.

04:31.560 --> 04:33.700
Whatever you want to
offer, we're very flexible.

04:33.700 --> 04:36.117
- I'm not too sure if it's my
style and that's dusty there.

04:36.117 --> 04:38.890
- That's a pretty special one.
- Why's it so special?

04:38.890 --> 04:40.630
Because it's got--
- Full of dust.

04:40.630 --> 04:41.902
- Yeah, West Virginia on it.

04:41.902 --> 04:43.600
- Uh, how much is--
- And this is almost heaven.

04:43.600 --> 04:44.580
- How much is that one?

04:44.580 --> 04:46.900
- It's whatever you offer.
- Are these second-hand?

04:46.900 --> 04:49.140
- No, not that, some
things are, but not that.

04:49.140 --> 04:51.070
- Well, it's your business,
are you selling many?

04:51.070 --> 04:52.200
Are you busy?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.070
- No, we don't really sell a lot of hats.

04:54.070 --> 04:55.650
- Oh, I see.
- Mm-hmm.

04:55.650 --> 04:57.270
- Well, you've got
customers in already. Hello.

04:57.270 --> 04:58.940
- This is my friend Sarah.

04:58.940 --> 05:00.390
- Sarah, oh.
- Nice to meet you.

05:00.390 --> 05:01.873
- Ah, well, good to see you.
- Nice to meet you.

05:01.873 --> 05:04.200
- Are you joining us for
lunch today, or are you--

05:04.200 --> 05:06.660
- I have no idea; I'm up to whatever.

05:06.660 --> 05:08.776
I'm here, I do-
- What does that mean?

05:08.776 --> 05:10.266
- She's just a family friend.
- Oh, you're a friend?

05:10.266 --> 05:11.836
Oh, okay, right, so you aren't
a customer, I'm so sorry.

05:11.836 --> 05:13.180
- I'm not a customer.

05:13.180 --> 05:15.250
- Is this a convenience store, or is it--

05:15.250 --> 05:16.550
- This is the dining room.

05:17.720 --> 05:19.643
- [Gordon] Wow, I mean, it's
very claustrophobic in here.

05:19.643 --> 05:20.476
- [Karan] It is.

05:20.476 --> 05:21.900
- There's bits and bobs of everything.

05:21.900 --> 05:23.680
Those freaky dolls, what are they for?

05:23.680 --> 05:26.530
- Well, they are sort of souvenirs.

05:26.530 --> 05:29.307
- Are you selling lots?
- We do, mm-hmm.

05:29.307 --> 05:30.330
- Wow, a bit dusty.

05:30.330 --> 05:32.270
- A lot of people who
come here have children.

05:32.270 --> 05:33.925
They're looking for
something to take back.

05:33.925 --> 05:35.570
- [Gordon] What about this
one here, collector's choice?

05:35.570 --> 05:37.910
How much is this one?
- I think $25.

05:37.910 --> 05:38.960
- Jesus, it's so dusty.

05:38.960 --> 05:40.203
- [Sarah] I didn't know
they were for sale.

05:40.203 --> 05:41.593
- [Gordon] You didn't
know they were for sale?

05:43.410 --> 05:45.100
How much does this room make a month?

05:45.100 --> 05:49.567
- Um... I can't give you
an exact figure because-

05:49.567 --> 05:50.400
- Right.

05:50.400 --> 05:52.420
- We record the purchases in
with the restaurant sales.

05:52.420 --> 05:53.253
- Yeah.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.250
- But I would say 15 percent of sales.

05:55.250 --> 05:56.920
- 15 percent?
- Mm-hmm.

05:56.920 --> 05:58.520
- Who drinks all this cider?

05:58.520 --> 06:00.740
- No, actually we use
that in the restaurant.

06:00.740 --> 06:01.660
- Jeez.

06:01.660 --> 06:02.767
- Well, but we sell a lot of it.

06:02.767 --> 06:06.143
It's good in the summer,
June, July, and August.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.540
Now, my daughter made those.
- Right, what are they?

06:09.540 --> 06:11.050
- They're little hats for little children.

06:11.050 --> 06:12.490
- It's full of dust and hair.

06:12.490 --> 06:13.770
And what's this?

06:13.770 --> 06:15.370
- [Karan] Hot pads, hand-made.

06:15.370 --> 06:16.203
- Hot pads?
- Mm-hmm.

06:16.203 --> 06:18.170
- Is that $60?

06:18.170 --> 06:19.260
Who buys this?

06:19.260 --> 06:20.830
- People with children.

06:20.830 --> 06:22.330
- I hope people with children.

06:23.910 --> 06:25.490
That's full of dust inside.

06:25.490 --> 06:27.940
- Well, you have to wash
it before you use it.

06:27.940 --> 06:28.773
- Look.

06:32.470 --> 06:34.930
And what's this, uh--
- This is Sarah's journal.

06:34.930 --> 06:36.490
- So she keeps a journal?
- Yeah.

06:36.490 --> 06:39.681
- Wow, so it's almost like a novel.

06:39.681 --> 06:41.540
- It is, and she puts sermon notes

06:41.540 --> 06:43.202
and telephone numbers, and prices--

06:43.202 --> 06:45.330
- Wow.
- She calls it her brain.

06:45.330 --> 06:47.890
- Look: public bathroom,
decorate with baskets, wow.

06:47.890 --> 06:51.008
- Yeah. She decorated the
baskets up in my washroom.

06:51.008 --> 06:53.040
- Oh, Oh, dear.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.260
Okay, wow, so, um--

06:55.260 --> 06:56.543
- All right.
- What's that there?

06:56.543 --> 06:58.110
- That is a bottle holder.

06:58.110 --> 06:59.657
You can put like a water bottle in it.

06:59.657 --> 07:01.060
- Oh.
- So it does appeal to--

07:01.060 --> 07:02.834
- Wow, I thought it was a
jock strap. Do you know what--

07:02.834 --> 07:05.570
- Uh, you know, it could-
- It looks like a jock strap.

07:05.570 --> 07:06.467
- I hadn't thought of that--
- Wow.

07:06.467 --> 07:08.357
- But you got a point.

07:08.357 --> 07:10.460
- What's that down there?
- This, that's our bread.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.960
And then behind that is the closet

07:12.960 --> 07:14.720
where our potatoes are kept.

07:14.720 --> 07:17.063
- But are, are the loaves for sale too?

07:18.090 --> 07:20.790
- If someone asks for them,
and hikers do sometime,

07:20.790 --> 07:23.950
but normally it's just for the breakfast.

07:23.950 --> 07:24.783
We have toast.

07:24.783 --> 07:26.030
- You expecting a lot of people?

07:26.030 --> 07:27.750
- That's how much we go
through in a few days,

07:27.750 --> 07:28.666
believe it or not.

07:28.666 --> 07:29.499
- Really?

07:29.499 --> 07:31.070
Unfortunately, they're
out of date as well.

07:31.070 --> 07:32.570
- Couldn't, are you serious?

07:32.570 --> 07:34.250
- 2nd of November.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.440
- Okay, you're right, today's the 6th.

07:36.440 --> 07:37.600
Oh, that's very embarrassing.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.593
- Damn, let's go to my room.

07:41.730 --> 07:42.760
What is that?

07:42.760 --> 07:44.073
- Oh, these are my famous baskets.

07:44.073 --> 07:44.906
- Baskets? Jesus.

07:44.906 --> 07:46.750
- Yeah, I love baskets,
and I collect them.

07:46.750 --> 07:47.890
- Beautiful Baskets 4 Sale.

07:47.890 --> 07:49.820
Prices vary from $1 to $30.

07:49.820 --> 07:51.307
Stop it. $30?

07:51.307 --> 07:52.800
- Well-
- Man!

07:52.800 --> 07:54.640
- [Karan] Some of them are very unique.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.657
- You're telling me that
families come in here

07:56.657 --> 07:58.870
and they go for a hike,
and they buy these baskets

07:58.870 --> 08:00.130
on the way?
- Mm-hmm.

08:00.130 --> 08:01.640
- To the mountains?
- Mm-hmm.

08:01.640 --> 08:03.290
- Stop.

08:03.290 --> 08:04.650
This one's full of bugs.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.167
- [Karan] I guess I wouldn't
buy that one, would you?

08:06.167 --> 08:07.690
- $12?
- Mm-hmm.

08:07.690 --> 08:08.880
- And that's with the cockroaches?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.480
- [Karan] We don't charge extra.

08:11.390 --> 08:13.740
- Wow, that was 12.99,
it's reduced down to $5.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.663
Oh, bugs in there, as well, bloody hell.

08:17.949 --> 08:20.150
Do you get them as gifts
and then resell them?

08:20.150 --> 08:22.686
- No, I just buy them
when I find them places.

08:22.686 --> 08:24.755
I collect them.
- Oh, what the hell is that?

08:24.755 --> 08:27.330
- It's a Easter basket.
- Ah, that's an Easter basket?

08:27.330 --> 08:28.750
Fucking hell, poor bunny.

08:28.750 --> 08:30.493
And how much is that, $1.

08:30.493 --> 08:33.020
- Yep.
- Wow, can you go any lower?

08:33.020 --> 08:34.049
- Nope.
- Eh?

08:34.049 --> 08:35.929
- We don't deal in cents.

08:35.929 --> 08:39.070
- Ay, yi, yi. Karan, you're
starting to scare me.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.823
Seriously, you are a basket case.

08:40.823 --> 08:41.657
- That's a good point.

08:41.657 --> 08:44.950
- Honestly, there's dust
everywhere up here as well.

08:44.950 --> 08:47.080
When was the last time
this place was dusted?

08:47.080 --> 08:48.660
- Uh, theoretically, every day.

08:48.660 --> 08:50.210
- Every, oh, every day?
- Yeah.

08:50.210 --> 08:52.150
- This is my room named after-
- This is.

08:52.150 --> 08:53.650
- The river.
- Potomac River.

08:55.090 --> 08:56.883
- Wow. Bloody hell.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.563
Oh, dear, and this is it?

09:00.420 --> 09:03.390
Wow, uh... wow.

09:03.390 --> 09:06.700
- We have five rooms, this one is 130.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.143
- Oh! Oh, shit.

09:10.912 --> 09:12.520
What happened there?

09:12.520 --> 09:13.570
- You're taller than I am.

09:13.570 --> 09:16.740
See, it just lays up there on top of the,

09:16.740 --> 09:18.150
no, see, there you go.

09:18.150 --> 09:20.660
- [Gordon] The pole is too
short, my darling, look.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.110
So, you see?
- There you go.

09:23.980 --> 09:26.048
- [Gordon] Look, that's there.

09:26.048 --> 09:28.270
- And this has been here since 2007-

09:28.270 --> 09:30.410
- Right.
- And it's never fallen down.

09:30.410 --> 09:31.493
- Oh, really?

09:32.790 --> 09:34.663
Flippin' A, oh shit.
(tin clattering)

09:34.663 --> 09:35.496
- [Karan] Okay.

09:35.496 --> 09:36.329
- Let's leave them there for now

09:36.329 --> 09:37.500
and let's get some light in here.

09:37.500 --> 09:41.371
Okay, I'm gonna unpack and-
- That, that's private.

09:41.371 --> 09:43.230
- What do you mean, it's
private, this is my bedroom.

09:43.230 --> 09:45.630
- Uh, well, but this is off-limits.

09:45.630 --> 09:48.253
It's got a lock on it,
it's like a storage closet.

09:49.190 --> 09:50.730
- But if I'm paying for the room

09:50.730 --> 09:52.130
I'd like to get into my wardrobe.

09:52.130 --> 09:53.050
- You're not paying for that,

09:53.050 --> 09:54.950
you're paying for everything else.

09:54.950 --> 09:56.420
- Well, then.

09:56.420 --> 09:57.253
- We've got these little things

09:57.253 --> 09:59.030
you can put your suitcase on.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.330
- But what's in here?

10:00.330 --> 10:01.770
- My clothes.

10:01.770 --> 10:04.000
- Your clothes?
- Mm-hmm.

10:04.000 --> 10:04.833
- Seriously?

10:04.833 --> 10:05.666
- Seriously.
- So you-

10:05.666 --> 10:07.397
- And it's very inconvenient
when there are people here

10:07.397 --> 10:10.700
and I can't get to my
clothes, but I live with it.

10:10.700 --> 10:13.661
- Um, I want to hang my
clothes in my wardrobe.

10:13.661 --> 10:16.520
- 1840, we use hooks.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.100
- Hooks.
- Mm-hmm.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.470
- Uh, why don't you get
me the key to open this?

10:20.470 --> 10:22.595
I need to hang my, uh, my jacket.

10:22.595 --> 10:24.845
- [Karan] Uh, you'll
just have to use a hook.

10:26.050 --> 10:27.960
- Um, once again, this is a rental.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.410
You're renting me a room.

10:29.410 --> 10:32.290
I'm here to help you, and
I'd like to use my wardrobe.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.561
- Mm-hmm.

10:33.561 --> 10:35.060
- Could I have a look inside then, please,

10:35.060 --> 10:37.593
'cause I'm just worried in
case you put somebody in there.

10:40.920 --> 10:42.720
- [Karan] There you go.

10:42.720 --> 10:46.593
- There are all your clothes?
- Mm-hmm, literally all.

10:46.593 --> 10:48.270
- That's it?
- That's it.

10:48.270 --> 10:51.580
Well, there's a few jackets
in the wardrobe upstairs.

10:51.580 --> 10:52.825
- So you have another wardrobe?

10:52.825 --> 10:54.260
- Right above us is another room.

10:54.260 --> 10:55.830
- And another room that you rent out...

10:55.830 --> 10:57.530
- With a padlock on.
- Mm-hmm.

10:57.530 --> 10:59.400
- Come on, you're paying $130

10:59.400 --> 11:01.230
for the owner's clothes
to stay in the wardrobe.

11:01.230 --> 11:03.080
That's a first for me, congratulations.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.010
I feel really uncomfortable

11:04.010 --> 11:07.033
about having my wardrobe
full of all your clothes.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.160
- I can cover it up,

11:09.160 --> 11:11.330
but it stays locked, so
you can just ignore it.

11:11.330 --> 11:14.160
- Can I just have half of
this, then? Do you mind?

11:14.160 --> 11:15.540
- [Karan] Oh, okay.

11:15.540 --> 11:17.150
Chelle?

11:17.150 --> 11:17.983
Chelle?

11:22.540 --> 11:27.340
- Wow, how much shit can
one get into the wardrobe?

11:27.340 --> 11:29.270
- Gordon wanted you to bring

11:29.270 --> 11:30.840
some of those clothes and things down.

11:30.840 --> 11:32.918
Just put them in my office, okay?

11:32.918 --> 11:34.620
(door knocking)

11:34.620 --> 11:35.930
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

11:35.930 --> 11:37.770
Do you see Karan wearing this stuff?

11:37.770 --> 11:39.880
- No, Karan wears about two outfits.

11:39.880 --> 11:42.290
- What do you mean she wears two outfits?

11:42.290 --> 11:43.440
- I've never seen her in anything

11:43.440 --> 11:46.083
other than what she's
wearing in denim and beige.

11:46.937 --> 11:49.436
- It's like garments from the Civil War.

11:49.436 --> 11:50.510
Do you ever go through this stuff, Karan?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.190
Do you ever think, "Wow,
I'll change colour today,

11:52.190 --> 11:54.821
maybe a bright colour with red or blue?"

11:54.821 --> 11:55.654
- Seasonally.

11:55.654 --> 11:56.520
- Seasonally?
- Mm-hmm.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.220
- So this is your fall look, now.

11:58.220 --> 11:59.546
This is how we head into winter.

11:59.546 --> 12:02.666
- In the summer, it's
usually denim or a beige.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.116
- Denim, okay, so no white
after Labour Day, then.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.190
- Never.
- Never.

12:08.190 --> 12:11.320
Okay, thank you, thank you.
- No problem.

12:11.320 --> 12:12.230
- Wow, this is crazy.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.787
I mean, I've never met such
a basket case like this

12:13.787 --> 12:14.820
in all my life.

12:14.820 --> 12:16.110
I mean, the place is cluttered.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.380
And it's almost like her
belongings are everywhere.

12:18.380 --> 12:19.213
You turn left or right,

12:19.213 --> 12:21.918
there's either a basket or
an item of Karan's clothing.

12:21.918 --> 12:26.205
What is that?

12:26.205 --> 12:27.705
Ugh. Fucking hell.

12:29.446 --> 12:30.446
Oh, my fuck.

12:31.936 --> 12:33.087
Pillowcases.

12:33.087 --> 12:35.100
What's in here?

12:35.100 --> 12:37.838
- Looks like a blanket.
- More baskets.

12:37.838 --> 12:39.410
- [Chelle] More baskets, of course.

12:39.410 --> 12:41.350
- My room is cluttered.

12:41.350 --> 12:44.400
And here, look at that in there.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.243
Oh, my God.

12:46.580 --> 12:48.103
Look at all this stuff.

12:49.910 --> 12:52.043
Fuck. (snorting)

12:53.360 --> 12:54.700
- How could you fit all that in there?

12:54.700 --> 12:57.750
That is, um, definitely took skill.

12:57.750 --> 12:58.690
- Where is she?

12:58.690 --> 12:59.794
- Downstairs in the dining room.

12:59.794 --> 13:02.370
- Ask her to come up here,
please, this is insane.

13:02.370 --> 13:03.760
- [Chelle] Karan?

13:03.760 --> 13:04.593
- [Karan] Yes?

13:08.600 --> 13:09.963
- Karan?
- Yes?

13:11.260 --> 13:12.860
- Look at all this stuff.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.810
Shoes, handbags, scarves.

13:14.810 --> 13:16.730
Just smell them, oof.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.683
- It smells like my shoes.

13:20.110 --> 13:22.010
- But they stink, my darling.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.274
They reek, you can't smell-
- Let me smell your shoes.

13:25.274 --> 13:26.470
- You want to smell my--

13:26.470 --> 13:28.870
- [Karan] They smell like my shoes, yeah.

13:28.870 --> 13:30.440
- They shouldn't be in my room.

13:30.440 --> 13:32.750
- Mm-hmm, well, like I said, in my mind,

13:32.750 --> 13:35.500
you rented everything
except this wardrobe,

13:35.500 --> 13:36.377
which I locked up.

13:36.377 --> 13:38.040
- Well, you didn't tell me
that when you took my money.

13:38.040 --> 13:38.890
- You didn't ask.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.930
- And what about these?

13:41.930 --> 13:43.190
- [Karan] Those are extra sets of linens.

13:43.190 --> 13:46.540
- Yeah, but why do I want
all them underneath my bed?

13:46.540 --> 13:48.663
- You don't need to be
under the bed, do you?

13:50.300 --> 13:51.510
But we'll get this out for you.

13:51.510 --> 13:53.663
And I'll just put it downstairs.

13:53.663 --> 13:54.496
- Right.

13:56.684 --> 13:57.517
Please.

13:58.903 --> 14:00.253
(sighing) Unbelievable.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.720
I just want to sleep in a
room that's not clustered.

14:10.306 --> 14:11.616
Oh.
- Excuse me.

14:11.616 --> 14:13.442
- Watch your step, please.
- Watch out.

14:13.442 --> 14:15.080
(bag thuds)

14:15.080 --> 14:17.110
(bright music)

14:17.110 --> 14:19.800
I have never experienced
a place like this before.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.810
Dolls, hats, baskets full of bugs,

14:22.810 --> 14:25.200
my wardrobe full of the owner's clothes.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.940
To be honest, I'm
frightened about the meal

14:27.940 --> 14:28.973
I'm about to eat.

14:30.595 --> 14:31.595
What's that?

14:32.785 --> 14:33.723
What is that?

14:33.723 --> 14:35.807
- [Chelle] That looks
like, uh, something that--

14:35.807 --> 14:37.340
- Can I buy this?
- Absolutely.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.030
- Chopsticks, why would you go hiking

14:39.030 --> 14:40.470
with a fucking pair of chopsticks?

14:40.470 --> 14:42.090
- And a little wooden spoon.

14:42.090 --> 14:43.080
- [Gordon] I'll take that.

14:43.080 --> 14:45.010
You can add it to my tab.

14:45.010 --> 14:48.053
- Brenda, I'm seating Gordon.
- Yes, ma'am.

14:49.060 --> 14:50.340
- Right here.

14:50.340 --> 14:52.330
I'm gonna start you
with an ice water, okay?

14:52.330 --> 14:54.000
- Yes, please.
(train horn blows)

14:54.000 --> 14:55.330
- And Brenda's gonna be--
- Fucking, ow.

14:55.330 --> 14:56.783
- How often does that thing go through?

14:56.783 --> 14:58.360
- Once an hour at least.

14:58.360 --> 15:00.640
- Yeah, any chance it
can go through the hotel?

15:00.640 --> 15:02.640
- [Chelle] Nah, I wouldn't think so, no.

15:04.239 --> 15:07.021
- What is going on?
(train horn blows)

15:07.021 --> 15:08.104
Jesus Christ.

15:10.260 --> 15:13.570
The Town's Inn in Harpers
Ferry, almost heaven.

15:13.570 --> 15:15.520
Certainly not my room, that's for sure.

15:16.604 --> 15:17.693
Hi.
- How you doing?

15:17.693 --> 15:19.240
- How are you?
- All right. Oh, my gosh!

15:19.240 --> 15:20.460
- First name is?
- Lamont.

15:20.460 --> 15:22.210
- Lamont, good to see you, what do you do?

15:22.210 --> 15:23.220
- Little bit of everything.

15:23.220 --> 15:25.420
- Big question, where do
you store your clothes?

15:25.420 --> 15:26.530
Do I have any of your clothes in my room?

15:26.530 --> 15:27.594
- Oh, no, no, sir, no, sir.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.700
- No, 'cause we're the same size.

15:28.700 --> 15:29.650
- Oh, no. (laughing)

15:29.650 --> 15:31.180
- Shoes under the bed?
- I promise, no.

15:31.180 --> 15:32.530
- Toys under the bed?
- None of mine.

15:32.530 --> 15:33.930
- Promise me?
- I promise.

15:33.930 --> 15:35.550
- Excellent, put her there.
- I promise you, yes, sir.

15:35.550 --> 15:36.420
- Good to see you.
- Nice meeting you.

15:36.420 --> 15:37.253
- Likewise.

15:37.253 --> 15:38.970
- All right.

15:38.970 --> 15:40.410
Are you ready?

15:40.410 --> 15:42.155
- [Gordon] Nice to see you,
how long have you been here?

15:42.155 --> 15:44.150
- Two years.
- Two years, how's it gone?

15:44.150 --> 15:45.750
- It's a little frustrating sometimes.

15:45.750 --> 15:46.583
- [Gordon] In which way?

15:46.583 --> 15:51.300
- Ms. Karan is just very
chaotic, she's eccentric.

15:51.300 --> 15:52.550
- Wow.
- Yeah.

15:52.550 --> 15:54.317
We have to knock on her
door when we come in

15:54.317 --> 15:55.883
and let her know we're here.

15:55.883 --> 15:56.716
- Right.

15:56.716 --> 15:58.200
- And sometimes she'll
slam the door in your face,

15:58.200 --> 16:00.650
or you never know what you're gonna get.

16:00.650 --> 16:01.910
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:01.910 --> 16:03.480
- I've never quite come
across an owner that is-

16:03.480 --> 16:04.837
- Oh, right, right.
- So out there.

16:04.837 --> 16:08.630
And all this stuff outside,
is that a fridge outside?

16:08.630 --> 16:10.860
- That's our, um, kitchen products.

16:10.860 --> 16:13.503
- Outside?
- Outside, yes.

16:13.503 --> 16:15.230
- And this fridge here?

16:15.230 --> 16:17.190
- That is for the owners' stuff.

16:17.190 --> 16:18.580
They keep their food in there.

16:18.580 --> 16:19.413
- Stop it.

16:19.413 --> 16:20.870
- No. Look, he's gonna
go look. Oh, my God.

16:20.870 --> 16:22.260
- Stop it, stop.

16:22.260 --> 16:23.210
- Let me move this.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.093
- Seriously?
- Oh, I'm scared.

16:28.833 --> 16:30.243
- What is that?
- What is that?

16:30.243 --> 16:33.530
- What is that?
- I have no idea.

16:33.530 --> 16:34.380
- [Gordon] Jesus.

16:37.220 --> 16:38.837
- I don't know.
- That is gnarly, huh?

16:38.837 --> 16:41.193
- [Brenda] Gnarly, he said that's gnarly.

16:42.110 --> 16:45.000
- [Gordon] So you have your
own personal fridge as well?

16:45.000 --> 16:45.833
Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:45.833 --> 16:47.780
- Outside?
- Well there's no room inside.

16:48.620 --> 16:49.460
- Okay, and what's that over there?

16:49.460 --> 16:50.880
- Over there?
- Yeah.

16:50.880 --> 16:53.870
- This is where we store our produce.

16:53.870 --> 16:55.810
- This is for the restaurant?
- Yes.

16:55.810 --> 16:57.420
- Seriously?

16:57.420 --> 16:59.263
Look at that, ugh, oh, man.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.500
- I can show you the receipts

17:01.500 --> 17:02.450
that we buy it fresh every week.

17:02.450 --> 17:03.880
- I'm not interested in the receipts.

17:03.880 --> 17:05.540
Fresh every week or every season?

17:05.540 --> 17:06.530
- Yeah.
- No, touch it.

17:06.530 --> 17:08.067
- Week, I don't want to touch it.

17:08.067 --> 17:08.900
- You don't want to touch it?
- No.

17:08.900 --> 17:09.733
- But you want to serve it?

17:09.733 --> 17:11.250
- [Gordon] Karan, look. It's
disintegrating in my hands.

17:11.250 --> 17:12.670
- [Karan] I don't even want to touch it.

17:12.670 --> 17:15.242
- More fridges down there?
- Yeah, this way.

17:15.242 --> 17:18.329
- [Gordon] Bloody hell. Man.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.599
How old are these freezers?

17:19.599 --> 17:21.569
- [Karan] This one's
about three years old.

17:21.569 --> 17:24.020
- No, when was the last
time it was defrosted?

17:24.020 --> 17:25.579
- I don't know.
- Bloody hell.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.369
And all this stuff stays outside?

17:28.369 --> 17:29.430
- Yep.

17:29.430 --> 17:32.626
- Jesus, what's in here?
- And that's a fridge.

17:32.626 --> 17:34.945
- Shit.
- More like a fridge.

17:34.945 --> 17:36.311
- So it's a fridge operating--

17:36.311 --> 17:37.144
- We use it as a fridge, mm-hmm.

17:38.017 --> 17:39.160
- But there's more bread in here.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.530
- Yeah, uh, this is how much we need.

17:41.530 --> 17:42.760
We keep running out of stuff.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.360
- You do not need all this.

17:44.360 --> 17:45.526
Absolutely impossible.

17:45.526 --> 17:46.505
- Well, I'll ask the--
- What's that?

17:46.505 --> 17:47.791
- Egg rolls.
- Egg rolls.

17:47.791 --> 17:49.037
- [Karan] Mm-hmm.

17:49.037 --> 17:51.684
- You're just hoarding stuff, Karan.

17:51.684 --> 17:52.517
And that?

17:54.749 --> 17:55.838
- Do you smoke, I don't.

17:55.838 --> 17:56.671
- I've never smoked in my life.

17:56.671 --> 17:57.632
- That's disgusting.

17:57.632 --> 17:58.465
- Me neither.
- Fucking hell.

17:58.465 --> 17:59.700
- I tried when I was 17.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.433
- Sausage, brats, this is insane.

18:06.590 --> 18:09.420
You've never smoked cigarettes.

18:09.420 --> 18:10.253
Anything else?

18:10.253 --> 18:12.317
- I graduated from high school in '67

18:12.317 --> 18:14.460
and that kind of marijuana,

18:14.460 --> 18:17.563
but I took one puff and it
made me sick, and I just.

18:22.864 --> 18:24.070
- [Brenda] All right.

18:24.070 --> 18:26.654
- Um, you know, I was hungry,
but I've sort of actually--

18:26.654 --> 18:28.063
- Lost your appetite?

18:28.063 --> 18:29.960
- Yeah, yet's start off
with mac and cheese.

18:29.960 --> 18:30.793
- [Brenda] Okay.

18:30.793 --> 18:32.537
- What else? The fiesta stew.

18:32.537 --> 18:33.370
- [Brenda] Okay.

18:33.370 --> 18:34.330
- Uh, let's have a trout, as well.

18:34.330 --> 18:35.620
- The trout, okay.
- Please.

18:35.620 --> 18:37.783
- Okay, I'll get that
going, be right back.

18:40.362 --> 18:41.195
- My God.

18:41.195 --> 18:42.640
- Okay, here's his ticket.

18:42.640 --> 18:45.100
Okay, look, that's how he ordered it.

18:45.100 --> 18:46.900
- So mac and cheese.
- Yep.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.080
- Are these yours?
- Yes, well, I bought them.

18:50.080 --> 18:51.250
- Oh, from my store.

18:51.250 --> 18:52.304
- From your store.

18:52.304 --> 18:54.800
- Okay, no wonder if I like them.

18:56.280 --> 18:57.930
- So mac and cheese...

18:57.930 --> 18:58.880
- Thank you, ma'am.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.910
Your mac and cheese.

19:02.910 --> 19:05.830
- That's mac and cheese?
- That's the mac and cheese.

19:05.830 --> 19:07.380
- Why's it all split on top?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.360
It looks like a soup.

19:08.360 --> 19:12.820
- It was in the fridge, and
then they microwaved it.

19:12.820 --> 19:14.020
- He's scared to eat it.

19:16.510 --> 19:17.720
- That is the weirdest

19:17.720 --> 19:19.680
and the most plastic-looking
mac and cheese

19:19.680 --> 19:20.930
I've ever seen in my entire life.

19:20.930 --> 19:22.495
There's no seasoning in
there, there's no salt.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.328
- [Brenda] Would you
like me to take it away?

19:23.328 --> 19:24.784
- Please.
- Okay, absolutely.

19:24.784 --> 19:26.260
- That deserves to be put under the bed.

19:26.260 --> 19:29.713
- Mac and cheese, he said it
needs to be put under the bed.

19:29.713 --> 19:31.005
- Yep.

19:31.005 --> 19:32.338
- There you go.

19:33.553 --> 19:34.930
- Thank you.

19:34.930 --> 19:37.590
Now we're off to fiesta stew.

19:37.590 --> 19:38.600
- Fiesta stew.

19:38.600 --> 19:41.470
So we have a Mexican-themed stew.

19:41.470 --> 19:42.420
- Correct.

19:42.420 --> 19:45.650
- And, um, when was the fiesta stew made?

19:45.650 --> 19:47.183
- I can go ask.
- Please.

19:48.934 --> 19:50.780
Ugh. Fucking hell.

19:50.780 --> 19:54.130
- Hey, Jill? When was
the fiesta stew made?

19:54.130 --> 19:55.530
What's the date on it?

19:55.530 --> 19:57.010
- Let me check.

19:57.010 --> 19:58.593
11/1.
- Okay.

20:01.360 --> 20:02.363
November 1st.

20:03.900 --> 20:06.542
- And today, today's the-
- Today's the 6th.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.640
- 6th.
- Yes.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.561
- So nothing's ever fresh?

20:10.561 --> 20:11.743
- Mmm, never.

20:12.930 --> 20:13.763
- That's terrible.

20:13.763 --> 20:14.678
- Do you want some hot sauce?

20:14.678 --> 20:16.610
- No. I'm fine.
- No? Okay.

20:16.610 --> 20:17.840
- I'll move on to the next course.

20:17.840 --> 20:19.383
- Well, let me take that away, okay.

20:20.770 --> 20:24.950
When was this caught? (laughing)

20:24.950 --> 20:26.430
- Yesterday, I caught
him out of the river.

20:26.430 --> 20:27.867
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:27.867 --> 20:29.373
All right, trout.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.310
And Jeff said he caught it yesterday.

20:32.310 --> 20:34.060
- So he caught it from
the frozen food section.

20:34.060 --> 20:34.893
- Correct.

20:39.870 --> 20:42.220
- Wow. It's just watery.
- Hmm.

20:42.220 --> 20:43.860
- How sad is that?

20:43.860 --> 20:44.693
- Okay.

20:44.693 --> 20:46.610
- Yeah, that's a disaster.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.170
- Disaster, all right.

20:48.170 --> 20:49.530
- Disaster trout.

20:49.530 --> 20:51.290
- It's disaster trout.

20:51.290 --> 20:52.310
- What's wrong with it?

20:52.310 --> 20:53.370
- It's watery,

20:53.370 --> 20:56.043
and he knows it wasn't
caught yesterday or today.

21:02.290 --> 21:03.490
- Sarah, what are you doing?

21:03.490 --> 21:07.270
- Putting labels-- um, magnet labels.

21:07.270 --> 21:08.627
- What, "Do Not Eat"?

21:10.170 --> 21:12.600
- No. I'm putting "Ice Cream."

21:12.600 --> 21:14.150
- You're putting labels on a freezer

21:14.150 --> 21:16.180
to tell the Muppets in the kitchen

21:16.180 --> 21:17.940
that that's ice cream in that container?

21:17.940 --> 21:19.140
- Karan had asked me to do it.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.680
- And when you work here,
Ms. Sarah, do you get paid?

21:21.680 --> 21:23.081
- Oh, no. I'm not on the payroll.

21:23.081 --> 21:23.914
- It's all volunteer?

21:23.914 --> 21:26.420
- I visit a lot, because
I'm semi-retired right now.

21:26.420 --> 21:28.860
Also this is my mini-bio.

21:28.860 --> 21:29.693
- Wow.
- Yes, sir.

21:29.693 --> 21:30.526
- Blood drives.

21:30.526 --> 21:32.110
- I run blood drives every two months.

21:32.110 --> 21:33.370
- Right.

21:33.370 --> 21:36.120
Wikipedia editor?
- Mm-hmm, I've done that.

21:36.120 --> 21:40.180
- Wow, you write, art,
travel, tutor, acronyms.

21:40.180 --> 21:41.570
You teach Greek?

21:41.570 --> 21:44.870
- I do.
- Inspire loyalty.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.420
You're a busy lady.
- Yes, sir.

21:46.420 --> 21:47.700
- And then, um--

21:47.700 --> 21:50.667
- And then I run circles
around naughty problems.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.057
- "I run circles around naughty problems."

21:53.057 --> 21:54.610
- Yeah, well, it there's something

21:54.610 --> 21:55.760
that needs to be figured out...

21:55.760 --> 21:57.300
I try and figure out a
way to solve the issue.

21:57.300 --> 22:00.355
- How about a big circle around Karan?

22:00.355 --> 22:02.017
- I try to do that.

22:02.017 --> 22:03.985
- May I have just a
quick look at the labels?

22:03.985 --> 22:05.500
Any other labels?

22:05.500 --> 22:08.800
- Sure, cheesecake, just things.

22:08.800 --> 22:12.233
- Chicken breasts, guacamole,
veggie burgers, tortillas.

22:12.233 --> 22:14.660
And you just stick them on
the side of the freezer?

22:14.660 --> 22:15.493
- Yes.

22:15.493 --> 22:17.980
- Let me tell you what you
should be making a sign.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.633
That's the only thing should
go on there: "Do Not Enter."

22:21.633 --> 22:23.593
- Ooh. That's brutal.

22:25.370 --> 22:27.090
- Can you put that on a magnet

22:27.090 --> 22:28.400
and stick that on each freezer

22:28.400 --> 22:30.142
and one on Ms. Karan's fridge as well?

22:30.142 --> 22:31.433
Thank you.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.927
Fuck me.

22:32.927 --> 22:35.427
(tense music)

22:37.150 --> 22:39.770
The Town's Inn is much
worse than I expected.

22:39.770 --> 22:42.610
The owner not only has a hoarding
problem with her clothes,

22:42.610 --> 22:44.823
but she's doing the same with her food.

22:46.320 --> 22:47.700
Uh, Lamont?

22:47.700 --> 22:48.533
- Yes, sir?

22:48.533 --> 22:50.350
- Where are you taking these?

22:50.350 --> 22:52.890
- Uh, she wanted me to
remove these until she can--

22:52.890 --> 22:55.470
- But I only took out one
bag out of my wardrobe.

22:55.470 --> 22:56.697
Where's the rest of them from?

22:56.697 --> 22:58.700
- Um, I have no idea.
- No!

22:58.700 --> 23:00.740
- I just know she had clothes upstairs,

23:00.740 --> 23:02.190
so she asked me to move them.

23:03.670 --> 23:06.363
- Lamont! Seriously?
- Mm-hmm.

23:08.490 --> 23:10.589
- Go get her for me, please.
- Yes, sir.

23:10.589 --> 23:11.589
- Holy shit.

23:13.924 --> 23:17.188
I mean. (laughs)

23:17.188 --> 23:18.300
- Ms. Karan?

23:18.300 --> 23:19.860
He say he want to talk to you.

23:19.860 --> 23:20.693
- Okay.

23:22.640 --> 23:23.620
- Ms. Karan.
- Yes?

23:23.620 --> 23:25.380
- Is this all yours?

23:25.380 --> 23:27.490
- That's what came from
out of the wardrobe.

23:27.490 --> 23:28.323
- Another wardrobe?

23:28.323 --> 23:30.370
- No, no, no, the one that you emptied.

23:30.370 --> 23:32.440
- No, I had one bag full of stuff.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.740
- No, this is the stuff

23:33.740 --> 23:36.083
that was in the black
wardrobe in your room.

23:37.940 --> 23:39.600
- But where's this stuff going now?

23:39.600 --> 23:41.460
- To his basement till I can sort it out.

23:41.460 --> 23:42.920
- His basement?
- Mm-hmm,

23:42.920 --> 23:44.950
'cause I don't have
anyplace to store here.

23:44.950 --> 23:45.783
- What is it?

23:45.783 --> 23:47.190
- It's my clothes.
- Clothes, her clothes.

23:47.190 --> 23:48.810
- The things that came
out of the black wardrobe

23:48.810 --> 23:50.920
that we keep locked up
in the Potomac Room.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.450
(Lamont laughing)

23:52.450 --> 23:53.400
- Do you ever ask yourself

23:53.400 --> 23:54.860
if you have a problem
holding on to things?

23:54.860 --> 23:57.103
Have you heard of the word hoarder?

23:58.130 --> 24:01.090
Ms. Karan, this is your business.

24:01.090 --> 24:03.790
This is your hotel, not your junk shop.

24:03.790 --> 24:04.623
- [Karan] Mm-hmm.

24:04.623 --> 24:05.670
- Can you get the team
out from the kitchen?

24:05.670 --> 24:07.160
I'd like to have a quick word
with you all on the terrace.

24:07.160 --> 24:07.993
- Yes, sir.

24:07.993 --> 24:08.865
- Um, good luck with that stuff.

24:08.865 --> 24:09.698
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

24:09.698 --> 24:10.531
- Thank you.

24:10.531 --> 24:12.310
- Ms. Karan, can we meet
the team on the terrace?

24:12.310 --> 24:15.360
One, two, three, four,
five, six, six bags.

24:15.360 --> 24:17.503
You want to check the
things for bugs as well.

24:24.270 --> 24:26.040
I'm in shock.

24:26.040 --> 24:26.873
Are you joining us, Ms. Sarah

24:26.873 --> 24:28.080
or are you still writing labels?

24:28.080 --> 24:29.157
- No, I'm not writing labels anymore.

24:29.157 --> 24:30.173
- No? Let's go.

24:31.410 --> 24:34.300
I arrive, the facade of the
outside looks beautiful.

24:34.300 --> 24:35.133
I walk through the door,

24:35.133 --> 24:37.650
and it's just like a cluster of shit.

24:37.650 --> 24:39.100
Crap everywhere.

24:39.100 --> 24:40.540
Mouldy bread in the reception.

24:40.540 --> 24:41.880
Freaky dolls.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.950
Up to the bedrooms that's,
like, just hideous.

24:43.950 --> 24:47.450
Wardrobe's packed with
clothes from 30 years ago.

24:47.450 --> 24:51.190
And I had to ask Ms. Karan
to get rid of the padlock

24:51.190 --> 24:54.780
so I can open up the wardrobe
and put my clothes in there.

24:54.780 --> 24:56.913
Honestly, the place is just ridden with,

24:57.790 --> 24:59.590
it's just like a Hoarders Anonymous.

25:00.720 --> 25:02.850
- Obviously, I needed a
place to put my clothes,

25:02.850 --> 25:05.180
and so that was where I put them.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.500
- You can't just hyphen off a wardrobe

25:07.500 --> 25:09.500
'cause it's full of your crap.

25:09.500 --> 25:11.040
You can't.
- Like I said,

25:11.040 --> 25:12.213
it's just a storage area.

25:12.213 --> 25:13.130
- No, but it's not a storage area,

25:13.130 --> 25:14.700
just like your fridge downstairs.

25:14.700 --> 25:18.080
This place is plagued
with junk on top of junk.

25:18.080 --> 25:20.680
Freezers overbearing, overfull.

25:20.680 --> 25:21.850
And as for the disgusting way

25:21.850 --> 25:25.040
that the fridge is kept
with the mouldy salad,

25:25.040 --> 25:26.490
there's salad that's festered,

25:26.490 --> 25:30.760
and it's almost sort of
disintegrated in the centre, rotten.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.500
Can I just quickly go on
to the size of the menu?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.333
- It's too big.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.830
- The kitchen's about
as big as my wardrobe.

25:34.830 --> 25:35.663
- It's too, it's way too much.

25:35.663 --> 25:37.220
- But why are you telling me that

25:37.220 --> 25:38.213
when the owner's standing next to you?

25:38.213 --> 25:41.240
- I told her that, but we have told her.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.090
She won't listen.

25:43.520 --> 25:45.240
- Mac and cheese all separated.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.520
Every mouthful is full of grease,

25:46.520 --> 25:49.070
'cause it was slow-cooked
in the microwave.

25:49.070 --> 25:50.980
- And that's the way we do it.

25:50.980 --> 25:53.480
People say that we've
got the best food in town

25:53.480 --> 25:54.639
and the freshest.

25:54.639 --> 25:56.140
- Oh, stop there.

25:56.140 --> 25:58.140
Now you're sounding slightly bizarre.

25:58.140 --> 25:59.503
The best food in town?

26:01.390 --> 26:02.690
Are you okay?

26:02.690 --> 26:04.220
- Well, it depends on how you define okay.

26:04.220 --> 26:05.640
I'm okay by-
- You sure?

26:05.640 --> 26:06.950
- By my standards.

26:06.950 --> 26:08.850
- But mac and cheese? I mean, come on.

26:10.550 --> 26:12.500
You know, what are you looking for now?

26:12.500 --> 26:14.460
Are you taking notes?
- My pen, yeah.

26:14.460 --> 26:15.510
- You're taking notes?

26:15.510 --> 26:17.433
- Yeah, you're making some good points.

26:20.450 --> 26:22.210
- And you're laughing.

26:22.210 --> 26:23.290
What's so funny then?

26:23.290 --> 26:24.563
Help me to understand.

26:25.930 --> 26:28.410
- I don't have anything
to do with the food.

26:28.410 --> 26:30.330
- So I don't know what you're doing.

26:30.330 --> 26:32.540
I've got no idea what you're doing.

26:32.540 --> 26:34.530
- What I ask her to, basically.

26:34.530 --> 26:36.490
- So she does what you say?

26:36.490 --> 26:37.723
- She helps me, yeah.

26:39.510 --> 26:41.400
- Jeff, is this correct?

26:41.400 --> 26:42.790
- I tell them to do one thing,

26:42.790 --> 26:43.750
Ms. Sarah tell them to do another.

26:43.750 --> 26:45.610
- Ms. Sarah tells you
what to do? She just-

26:45.610 --> 26:47.510
- And-
- She says she's a volunteer.

26:47.510 --> 26:51.193
- She tells my crew what
to do, and it piss me off.

26:52.080 --> 26:54.664
I get mad then they blame it on me, so-

26:54.664 --> 26:56.880
- But she's got no authority to do that.

26:56.880 --> 26:59.440
- Jeff, you've never
talked to me about this.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.900
- I have told you-
- Wait a minute.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.670
- I have told you about this.

27:03.670 --> 27:05.110
- Is this true?

27:05.110 --> 27:06.320
Is this the way you treat the staff?

27:06.320 --> 27:07.820
Nothing more humiliating to the team

27:07.820 --> 27:10.160
that are on the ground
keeping this place open

27:10.160 --> 27:12.800
and then a stranger comes in
and tells them what to do.

27:12.800 --> 27:13.810
- Well, she's not a stranger.

27:13.810 --> 27:14.643
She's been coming here since--

27:14.643 --> 27:15.476
- To them she is,

27:15.476 --> 27:18.120
because she's not exactly
qualified to run this place.

27:19.159 --> 27:22.050
This is so screwed up, this is bizarre.

27:22.050 --> 27:23.980
- Ain't nobody hearing me what I'm saying.

27:23.980 --> 27:25.480
- And what kind of
message are you sending?

27:25.480 --> 27:26.980
- The menu need to be down.

27:26.980 --> 27:30.340
- A menu like this, there
must be 50 items on there,

27:30.340 --> 27:34.113
which 49 of them are tapped
out of the bloody freezer.

27:35.070 --> 27:37.590
This place is so messed up.

27:37.590 --> 27:41.292
It's a mess, a disgusting, festering mess.

27:41.292 --> 27:43.207
- Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet.

27:43.207 --> 27:45.707
(tense music)

27:48.760 --> 27:50.497
- Unbelievable.

27:50.497 --> 27:53.576
- I don't know, I'm just
so fucking embarrassed.

27:53.576 --> 27:56.159
- I know, I know. Jeff, I know.

28:09.830 --> 28:13.040
- So far, I've learned that not
only does Karan hoard items,

28:13.040 --> 28:15.410
but she's also a controlling owner.

28:15.410 --> 28:18.430
Tonight, I want to see how
the Town's Inn operates

28:18.430 --> 28:19.570
during the evening.

28:19.570 --> 28:20.820
How are you?
- Good.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.930
- And your name is?
- My name's Tyler.

28:22.930 --> 28:24.500
- Tyler, what do you do?

28:24.500 --> 28:25.360
- Um, I'm a server.

28:25.360 --> 28:26.800
- Okay, great, Tyler and--hello.

28:26.800 --> 28:27.633
- Hi, I'm Gauge.

28:27.633 --> 28:29.520
- Gauge. What do you two do out here?

28:29.520 --> 28:30.830
- We are both servers.

28:30.830 --> 28:31.980
- Come here, so I can talk to you.

28:31.980 --> 28:33.140
Where is the best place to hang this?

28:33.140 --> 28:34.730
- I can hang it for you, sir.

28:34.730 --> 28:37.020
I mean, if we didn't have these
filthy hats laying around--

28:37.020 --> 28:38.970
- I know, why do you have
filthy hats in the hallway?

28:38.970 --> 28:39.820
- Looks like a-
- So-

28:39.820 --> 28:41.090
- Looks like a thrift shop, sir.

28:41.090 --> 28:42.210
- Thrift shop.

28:42.210 --> 28:43.100
How old are you guys?

28:43.100 --> 28:44.219
- I am 17.
- I am also 17.

28:44.219 --> 28:45.470
- 17.

28:45.470 --> 28:47.310
Objectively, what's wrong with this place?

28:47.310 --> 28:50.150
- Well, I think that
we're not well-organized.

28:50.150 --> 28:52.880
I also think that we need
to work on cleanliness.

28:52.880 --> 28:53.713
- Cleanliness.
- Yes.

28:53.713 --> 28:54.630
- Wow, is it that bad?

28:54.630 --> 28:55.730
- It can be.

28:55.730 --> 28:57.060
- So what do you think's dirty?

28:57.060 --> 29:00.210
- Well, honestly, probably the kitchen

29:00.210 --> 29:01.220
and some of the rooms.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.360
- Why you going under
the mat like that, what?

29:03.360 --> 29:05.050
- You asked what was dirty, so I mean,

29:05.050 --> 29:07.160
common things that we
try to clean every day

29:07.160 --> 29:08.840
that we can't always keep an eye on.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.080
- Show me where the
kitchen is please, yeah?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.283
- Okay.
- Thank you.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.190
What happened here?

29:14.190 --> 29:15.467
- Sarah likes to paint on the walls.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.650
- Hello.
- Hello.

29:16.650 --> 29:17.483
- Hi.

29:17.483 --> 29:18.410
- What's this mess here?

29:18.410 --> 29:21.633
- This is a painting, and I--
- A what?

29:22.630 --> 29:23.560
A painting?
- Yes, sir.

29:23.560 --> 29:24.952
- It looks like someone
shat all over the walls.

29:24.952 --> 29:26.440
(Gauge laughing)
- Is that hygienic?

29:26.440 --> 29:27.940
You're painting the walls of the kitchen.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.367
- I have no idea, I thought it was.

29:29.367 --> 29:31.300
- You have no idea so why did you do it?

29:31.300 --> 29:33.850
- The Town's Inn became
Sarah's Town's Inn,

29:33.850 --> 29:35.540
even though she had nothing to do

29:35.540 --> 29:37.330
with owning the establishment.

29:37.330 --> 29:39.110
- Karan, did you see
the mess in the kitchen?

29:39.110 --> 29:40.820
She's painted the wall.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.617
Let me show you something.
- Oh, in here?

29:42.617 --> 29:44.140
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

29:44.140 --> 29:45.040
- Have you seen it?

29:45.040 --> 29:47.756
- Yes. It's one of my favourite things.

29:47.756 --> 29:48.589
You don't like it?

29:48.589 --> 29:50.160
- It's one of your favourite things?

29:50.160 --> 29:50.993
No, seriously.

29:52.630 --> 29:54.840
- I'm alive, maybe not well.

29:54.840 --> 29:56.619
Did you see the mural in the dining room?

29:56.619 --> 29:57.452
- What?

29:57.452 --> 29:59.880
- That is a children assist-- inn guests.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.260
- That's unique, isn't it?

30:01.260 --> 30:02.170
- What is that?

30:02.170 --> 30:04.870
- Well, it started as a crack in the wall,

30:04.870 --> 30:07.144
and I asked Sarah to make a vine.

30:07.144 --> 30:08.678
- Is there anywhere else you painted?

30:08.678 --> 30:09.980
- There is a, uh--
- Oh, in your room.

30:09.980 --> 30:10.930
- In my room?

30:10.930 --> 30:11.983
Show me, please.

30:15.299 --> 30:17.407
What have you done to my wall?

30:17.407 --> 30:19.560
This is so weird, you paint over cracks.

30:19.560 --> 30:21.050
- I know.
- Look at this here.

30:21.050 --> 30:24.270
- I know, and this,
apparently is something new

30:24.270 --> 30:26.530
that's falling apart. Wow.

30:26.530 --> 30:28.621
- I mean-
- Must be wet.

30:28.621 --> 30:29.463
- Wet, it's soaking wet.

30:29.463 --> 30:34.463
The plaster's just-
- Whoa! (giggling)

30:36.010 --> 30:37.050
- These are bits of card.

30:37.050 --> 30:39.410
- That's correct, it was a temporary fix.

30:39.410 --> 30:41.650
- So it's not a mural,
it's business cards.

30:41.650 --> 30:42.930
you put your cards on here,

30:42.930 --> 30:44.630
and then you paint over the cards?

30:48.370 --> 30:49.937
You should make a label for this:

30:49.937 --> 30:52.820
"Decaying Wall, do not paint over it."

30:52.820 --> 30:57.780
I mean, what, the wall's rotten,

30:57.780 --> 30:59.360
and you just go paint over it?

30:59.360 --> 31:01.110
- It was meant as a temporary fix.

31:01.110 --> 31:02.957
- The wall is rotten.
- You're right.

31:02.957 --> 31:04.450
- And you just paint over it?

31:04.450 --> 31:08.130
You can't just go filling
cracks with tacky painting.

31:08.130 --> 31:09.200
Look at down here!

31:09.200 --> 31:11.513
You've gone over cracks and holes. Look!

31:13.100 --> 31:13.933
Jesus, ugh.

31:16.760 --> 31:18.050
What's that in there?

31:18.050 --> 31:22.650
- Um, I put some sort of a
mesh, because it was a hole

31:22.650 --> 31:26.030
and I didn't want anything
to come through it.

31:26.030 --> 31:27.270
- Jesus.

31:27.270 --> 31:28.810
- I wish you wouldn't use that word.

31:28.810 --> 31:30.580
- What, hole?

31:30.580 --> 31:32.400
Do you want me to sing fucking hallelujah?

31:32.400 --> 31:33.350
- That'd be better.

31:34.536 --> 31:37.590
- Pfff! (coughing)

31:37.590 --> 31:38.480
Can you get me Karan?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.530
- I can get you Karan.
- Please? Jesus.

31:41.530 --> 31:43.213
- Watch your language, sir.

31:47.162 --> 31:48.745
- What in the fuck?

31:50.040 --> 31:51.611
Ms. Karan-
- (gasps) Oh, my goodness.

31:51.611 --> 31:53.320
- Yeah, well, the whole thing
just started coming off.

31:53.320 --> 31:56.560
The wall needs repairing, and
she's just painting over it.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.570
And then secondly, she
found a big hole here,

31:59.570 --> 32:01.710
started putting her cards on there,

32:01.710 --> 32:03.040
and then painted over that.

32:03.040 --> 32:03.873
- Mm-hmm.

32:03.873 --> 32:07.063
- But inside the hole, oh Jesus.

32:09.640 --> 32:10.990
This is not a papier-mache.

32:13.430 --> 32:15.690
What is she doing to your hotel?

32:15.690 --> 32:16.613
- It didn't go outside, I mean,

32:16.613 --> 32:18.920
It's not a hole to the outside.

32:18.920 --> 32:20.520
- It's not a hole to the outside?

32:20.520 --> 32:21.377
- No.
- What does that mean?

32:21.377 --> 32:23.180
- The stone wall is out there.

32:23.180 --> 32:24.239
- But we're sleeping on the inside,

32:24.239 --> 32:25.760
we're not sleeping on the outside.

32:25.760 --> 32:28.100
- Right, so you're not
getting any cold draughts

32:28.100 --> 32:29.140
or anything through there.

32:29.140 --> 32:31.237
- So it's just like I don't
get to use the wardrobe,

32:31.237 --> 32:33.080
and the hole's in the
inside, not the outside,

32:33.080 --> 32:34.770
and we can just do what we want?

32:34.770 --> 32:36.950
- Well, it's solid.
- She's stuffing in--

32:36.950 --> 32:37.783
- It's really solid.

32:37.783 --> 32:39.620
- It needs re-plastering.
- And it's stone out there.

32:39.620 --> 32:41.740
- You can't just paint over that.

32:41.740 --> 32:43.040
- Well, you can.

32:43.040 --> 32:43.873
We did, but.

32:43.873 --> 32:46.433
- And then stick Brillo pads in the hole.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.630
You can't just Band-Aid this place.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.020
Oh, my good God.

32:51.020 --> 32:53.430
Just wash my hands.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.310
- An order of French bread as an app.

32:55.310 --> 32:56.570
- All right.

32:56.570 --> 32:59.050
- Um, what is that there, a sports bar?

32:59.050 --> 33:00.680
Are these TV screens, what are those?

33:00.680 --> 33:02.430
- Microwaves.
- Microwaves.

33:02.430 --> 33:03.690
- How many microwaves have you got?

33:03.690 --> 33:06.983
- Well, there's four here,
and one in there, that's five.

33:06.983 --> 33:09.580
- Five microwaves and two chefs?

33:09.580 --> 33:11.320
- Two chefs.

33:11.320 --> 33:12.153
- Oh, my God.

33:12.996 --> 33:15.540
Everywhere I turn, there's
just junk everywhere.

33:15.540 --> 33:17.150
Well, this is cooking stuff.

33:17.150 --> 33:18.487
- Trust me, I know what cooking stuff is.

33:18.487 --> 33:19.320
This is not cooking stuff.

33:19.320 --> 33:20.170
- Okay.

33:20.170 --> 33:23.200
- How does this kitchen
function, give me a little tour.

33:23.200 --> 33:24.033
- Very challenging.

33:24.033 --> 33:25.440
- It's very, very challenging.

33:25.440 --> 33:26.273
- What's that in there?

33:26.273 --> 33:29.415
- That's a burger that I'm heating up.

33:29.415 --> 33:31.460
- A boiled-
- Yep.

33:31.460 --> 33:32.870
- You're boiling a burger.

33:32.870 --> 33:34.063
- I'm just heating it back up.

33:34.063 --> 33:35.400
- When you say heating it back up,

33:35.400 --> 33:36.890
why aren't you cooking it from fresh?

33:36.890 --> 33:38.300
- 'Cause we make them ahead of time.

33:38.300 --> 33:40.160
- This is what we got here, we don't.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.171
- A boiled burger!

33:42.171 --> 33:43.960
Are you aware the burgers are boiled?

33:43.960 --> 33:45.570
- Um, no.

33:45.570 --> 33:48.030
- Do you think a customer
would want a burger

33:48.030 --> 33:49.370
boiled in water?

33:49.370 --> 33:50.690
- They seem to like them.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.000
- Just taste the water.

33:52.000 --> 33:53.405
- Do I have to?

33:53.405 --> 33:54.940
- Funny, you won't taste it.

33:54.940 --> 33:56.350
- Okay, well, I just...

33:59.650 --> 34:01.920
Tastes like water with beef in it.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.670
- That seems okay?

34:03.670 --> 34:06.010
- When they fix it up
on a nice Kaiser roll

34:06.010 --> 34:07.527
with lettuce, tomato, onions-

34:07.527 --> 34:08.360
- Oh, come on.

34:09.239 --> 34:11.353
- I need a tong, please.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.404
I need a set of tongs, please.

34:12.404 --> 34:13.632
- Ugh, shit.

34:15.840 --> 34:16.730
No, this is a joke.

34:16.730 --> 34:19.120
This is terrible, a boiled burger.

34:19.120 --> 34:21.290
I'm appalled to learn that the Town's Inn

34:21.290 --> 34:23.280
boils pre-cooked burgers.

34:23.280 --> 34:26.036
Brenda, where--just show me
the table with the burgers.

34:26.036 --> 34:28.940
And what's more frustrating
is how Karan doesn't think

34:28.940 --> 34:30.659
there is anything wrong with that.

34:30.659 --> 34:33.023
Come with me, two seconds,
let me show you something.

34:34.350 --> 34:35.246
Perfect, let me take that.

34:35.246 --> 34:36.320
- Want to take it for me, absolutely.

34:36.320 --> 34:38.030
- So that's your burger.

34:38.030 --> 34:39.810
Out of respect to the customer

34:39.810 --> 34:41.989
I'm not gonna sit and
watch you eat that shit.

34:41.989 --> 34:42.857
Let me show you.

34:43.969 --> 34:45.773
So this is the chef.

34:45.773 --> 34:46.719
- Yes?

34:46.719 --> 34:48.560
- Will you just explain
how you cooked that?

34:48.560 --> 34:49.393
- We pre-cook it-

34:49.393 --> 34:50.949
- No, start from the top, please.

34:50.949 --> 34:52.050
I'm not gonna let you eat that.

34:52.050 --> 34:55.580
- We, um, pre-cook them-
You made the burger when?

34:55.580 --> 34:58.045
- Um, Jill, when were them burgers made?

34:58.045 --> 34:59.747
- Yesterday, I believe.
- Yesterday.

34:59.747 --> 35:03.210
- And just explain how you
reheated them for the gentleman.

35:03.210 --> 35:05.097
- I reheated them, I put water in there,

35:05.097 --> 35:07.460
and I put the burger in there.

35:07.460 --> 35:08.630
- Were you expecting a fresh burger,

35:08.630 --> 35:09.816
or some shit reheated from yesterday?

35:09.816 --> 35:10.649
- I was expecting something fresh, yes.

35:10.649 --> 35:12.130
- I will give you a fresh burger, okay?

35:12.130 --> 35:13.340
- My apologies. Thank you.

35:13.340 --> 35:14.820
- I'm sorry, sir.

35:14.820 --> 35:17.530
- Okay, this ticket refused their food.

35:17.530 --> 35:18.550
- Okay.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.383
- Young man.

35:21.120 --> 35:22.370
Out of respect for our guests,

35:22.370 --> 35:23.410
take the ladies outside

35:23.410 --> 35:24.720
and show them where we
keep the freezers, can you?

35:24.720 --> 35:26.260
Ladies and gentlemen, just
bear with us for two minutes.

35:26.260 --> 35:27.490
But we're just gonna show you something

35:27.490 --> 35:28.693
I would like you to see.

35:28.693 --> 35:30.300
- Yes, so just follow me.

35:30.300 --> 35:31.750
This is just right down here.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.690
Watch your-
- Out here?

35:34.690 --> 35:37.083
- Yes, um, right here
back to the trash, yes.

35:39.010 --> 35:41.760
Um, this is our lasagna.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.440
This is our trout.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.320
We got more sausage, ice cream,

35:45.320 --> 35:47.329
these are your egg rolls, right there.

35:47.329 --> 35:50.352
- So I just had frozen
egg rolls from here?

35:50.352 --> 35:51.289
- Yes.
- From outside.

35:51.289 --> 35:53.060
- Yes, yes ma'am. Yes, ma'am.

35:53.060 --> 35:55.190
We've got two freezers,
and everything's scattered.

35:55.190 --> 35:56.023
Very cluttered.

35:56.023 --> 35:58.800
I mean, Karan has always
looked at this as her home.

35:58.800 --> 36:00.060
Obviously, it is embarrassing,

36:00.060 --> 36:02.210
but it's a serious situation
that needs to be solved.

36:02.210 --> 36:03.980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:03.980 --> 36:05.360
- I'm sorry. Yeah?

36:05.360 --> 36:06.740
- It's okay.

36:06.740 --> 36:09.370
But I think I'll just cancel my order.

36:09.370 --> 36:10.260
- My apologies.

36:10.260 --> 36:11.810
I discovered that today

36:11.810 --> 36:13.290
and out of respect for you as customers,

36:13.290 --> 36:16.440
I can't sit here and fake
you eating that shit.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.117
So I'm hoping that you'll
skip around the menu

36:18.117 --> 36:20.080
and order something a little more...

36:20.080 --> 36:20.913
- Thank you.

36:20.913 --> 36:22.309
- Keeping. My apologies. Thank you.

36:22.309 --> 36:23.142
- Thank you so much.

36:23.142 --> 36:25.300
- Didn't you have purple glasses earlier?

36:25.300 --> 36:26.133
- Yeah.

36:26.133 --> 36:26.966
- They change from dark to light.

36:26.966 --> 36:28.030
- Oh, that is so cool,

36:28.030 --> 36:30.530
'cause they look like
they're dark brown or black.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.610
- That is so cool.

36:33.610 --> 36:35.230
- This is insane.
- Yeah.

36:35.230 --> 36:37.420
Sarah claims to "work" at the Town's Inn.

36:37.420 --> 36:39.140
- Here's a free postcard for everybody.

36:39.140 --> 36:41.440
- When I go to serve tables,
she will randomly show up,

36:41.440 --> 36:43.030
will talk to tables.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.479
I've seen her frustrate people.

36:45.479 --> 36:46.583
- Sarah.

36:46.583 --> 36:47.477
Ms. Sarah.

36:47.477 --> 36:49.580
- Is someone calling me? I have to go.

36:49.580 --> 36:50.440
Bye.

36:50.440 --> 36:51.420
Yes, sir?

36:51.420 --> 36:53.180
- They don't need to hear your life story.

36:53.180 --> 36:56.320
They want to sit and have a
romantic drink on the terrace.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.282
Leave them alone.

36:57.282 --> 36:58.594
- Okay, I'm leaving them.

36:58.594 --> 37:00.483
- In and out, there are other tables.

37:01.351 --> 37:02.184
Man.

37:03.410 --> 37:06.773
- Okay, we're gonna need
a rotisserie chicken.

37:08.210 --> 37:09.500
- That's the rotisserie chicken?

37:09.500 --> 37:11.560
You get it from the freezer?

37:11.560 --> 37:12.393
- Yup.

37:14.110 --> 37:14.943
- Disgusting.

37:17.890 --> 37:19.670
Just explain the
rotisserie chicken, please.

37:19.670 --> 37:21.140
- Show the table?
- Yeah.

37:21.140 --> 37:24.090
- This is the dish of the day,
It's our rotisserie chicken.

37:24.930 --> 37:27.330
It was roasted six months
ago in a grocery store,

37:27.330 --> 37:29.770
and we're serving it for $12.

37:29.770 --> 37:31.500
- On the menu, it's
got rotisserie chicken.

37:31.500 --> 37:32.515
- Yeah.

37:32.515 --> 37:33.940
- You buy them at a grocery store.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.400
- Yes, mm-hmm.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.657
- And you freeze them.

37:36.657 --> 37:38.760
And you reheat them in the microwave.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.650
- Not in the microwave.

37:39.650 --> 37:41.980
- It went in the microwave.

37:41.980 --> 37:43.293
What is going on here?

37:44.350 --> 37:48.753
- Well, we have a menu, and we just do it.

37:48.753 --> 37:50.690
- How, no, it's just pathetic.

37:50.690 --> 37:51.920
How many of your guests tonight

37:51.920 --> 37:53.820
think that their chicken's
been roasted in-house?

37:53.820 --> 37:55.258
- Maybe half?

37:55.258 --> 37:58.530
- Let's just come in,
then, let's double-check.

37:58.530 --> 37:59.780
Ladies and gentlemen, so sorry.

37:59.780 --> 38:02.120
Could I just have your
attention for 30 seconds?

38:02.120 --> 38:03.850
How many of you who were gonna order

38:03.850 --> 38:05.290
the roast chicken this evening

38:05.290 --> 38:08.640
would expect it to be
fresh, roasted in-house?

38:08.640 --> 38:10.640
Could you raise your hands, please?

38:10.640 --> 38:11.790
I think it's everybody.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.257
- A lot of people say it's good.

38:17.257 --> 38:19.188
- No.
- I agree that it should be-

38:19.188 --> 38:21.840
- These guests have come out
of their homes to come and eat.

38:21.840 --> 38:22.950
But what I'm not gonna do

38:22.950 --> 38:24.470
is attempt to pull the
wool over their eyes,

38:24.470 --> 38:26.180
'cause they deserve to
know what's going on.

38:26.180 --> 38:27.850
The burgers were cooked yesterday

38:27.850 --> 38:29.700
and re-heated in a pan, boiling in water.

38:29.700 --> 38:30.750
And I'm flabbergasted.

38:30.750 --> 38:33.240
So you need to take a
real good look at yourself

38:33.240 --> 38:35.770
and stop bullshitting
customers immediately.

38:35.770 --> 38:37.760
Otherwise, I'm out of here.

38:37.760 --> 38:40.740
I'm so sorry, but you, as
customers, deserve better.

38:40.740 --> 38:42.300
And this has nothing to
do with the TV programme.

38:42.300 --> 38:43.500
I promise you now.

38:43.500 --> 38:44.980
It's based on the bad practises

38:44.980 --> 38:46.250
that's going on in that kitchen.

38:46.250 --> 38:48.850
So my apologies, but I'm
not gonna allow you to eat.

38:49.750 --> 38:51.230
You're not gonna act responsible for it.

38:51.230 --> 38:52.620
I will.

38:52.620 --> 38:53.770
We're shutting it down.

38:55.850 --> 38:57.000
We're shutting it down.

38:58.509 --> 38:59.680
- He just sent everybody home.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.980
- Stop, stop.

39:01.980 --> 39:05.663
That is possibly the worst
thing I've seen so far.

39:06.630 --> 39:07.463
How'd you reheat that?

39:07.463 --> 39:09.543
- In the microwave.
- In the microwave.

39:12.565 --> 39:13.970
It doesn't even hit an oven.
- Yes.

39:13.970 --> 39:16.440
- But we used to cook them fresh, right?

39:16.440 --> 39:17.720
- So what changed?

39:17.720 --> 39:20.090
- I wasn't here-
- Yeah, so what happened?

39:20.090 --> 39:21.690
Stop, I'm not serving any.

39:21.690 --> 39:22.540
Stop.

39:22.540 --> 39:24.180
What happened?

39:24.180 --> 39:25.510
- Ask Karan.

39:25.510 --> 39:27.821
I ain't the one that bought the chickens.

39:27.821 --> 39:30.210
I'd rather have a
rotisserie thing back there.

39:30.210 --> 39:31.490
I could have fresh chicken.

39:31.490 --> 39:32.520
We need new equipment.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.520
- This is what it's resulted in.

39:34.520 --> 39:35.430
This is what we're serving.

39:35.430 --> 39:36.760
You can't buy this from a grocery store.

39:36.760 --> 39:37.593
- No, you can't.

39:37.593 --> 39:38.490
- Sprinkle it with parsley

39:38.490 --> 39:40.030
and expect to call
yourselves a restaurant.

39:40.030 --> 39:42.537
- I know what you, I know what you saying.

39:42.537 --> 39:44.230
- And you just, like a butterfly,

39:44.230 --> 39:46.740
fly around just painting
little bits of shit over holes.

39:46.740 --> 39:48.107
This is insane.

39:48.107 --> 39:50.677
I'm done, I'm upset.

39:50.677 --> 39:54.760
I'm feeling sick, and I've never
seen such a disgusting mess

39:54.760 --> 39:56.540
in all my fucking life.

39:56.540 --> 39:59.363
It's an embarrassment to
you, you, you, and me.

40:00.210 --> 40:01.490
And I'm not gonna stand there

40:01.490 --> 40:03.170
and watch you serve shit like that

40:03.170 --> 40:04.780
and take customers' money.

40:04.780 --> 40:05.743
What is this?

40:07.990 --> 40:09.920
- I eat them often,the rotisserie.

40:09.920 --> 40:11.763
- You eat them often?
- Mm-hmm.

40:11.763 --> 40:13.000
- What does that say?

40:13.000 --> 40:14.990
- And I guess it's just that I don't...

40:16.490 --> 40:18.330
- What does that mean to you?

40:18.330 --> 40:20.163
You eat this crap often?

40:21.340 --> 40:22.233
Come on.

40:23.480 --> 40:24.853
You're running a hotel.

40:27.670 --> 40:29.523
The burgers were cooked yesterday.

40:30.510 --> 40:31.507
- Well, when I ate them,

40:31.507 --> 40:33.499
and I always tell them,
they tasted good to me, so-

40:33.499 --> 40:34.593
- Oh, God.

40:34.593 --> 40:36.660
Where's the burgers that you cooked?

40:36.660 --> 40:38.350
- Down here, sir.
- Get them.

40:38.350 --> 40:40.440
- My understanding is he patted them out

40:40.440 --> 40:42.030
and then put them in the oven.

40:42.030 --> 40:43.107
- How long for?

40:43.107 --> 40:46.520
- For about 15, 20 minutes.
- 15, 20 minutes in an oven.

40:46.520 --> 40:48.910
How many of your customers expect burgers

40:48.910 --> 40:50.203
to be cooked like that?

40:51.060 --> 40:52.600
Baked in the oven for 20 minutes,

40:52.600 --> 40:54.680
so there's no colour
on there, cooled down,

40:54.680 --> 40:58.250
stuck in a zip-locker
bag, out boiled in water.

40:58.250 --> 40:59.830
Should we go and do another survey.

40:59.830 --> 41:02.309
- Well, it's 80% chuck,
it's just a hamburger.

41:02.309 --> 41:03.142
- You're in denial.

41:03.142 --> 41:05.570
You are seriously in denial.

41:05.570 --> 41:07.480
Ms. Sarah, would you like a bite?

41:07.480 --> 41:09.070
No, thank you.
- Why not?

41:09.070 --> 41:10.460
- It's not cooked right.

41:10.460 --> 41:13.040
- Well, should I boil it
up for you and get it warm?

41:13.040 --> 41:14.193
What colour is that?

41:15.830 --> 41:16.663
It's white.

41:17.890 --> 41:18.970
That's what frustrates me.

41:18.970 --> 41:21.153
We're all pretending that this is good.

41:23.210 --> 41:25.340
- I thought that's what the cooks-

41:25.340 --> 41:27.010
- No.
- I mean-

41:27.010 --> 41:28.137
- Come on.

41:28.137 --> 41:30.060
- I'm not trying to blame
it on the cooks, but-

41:30.060 --> 41:33.630
- You can't blame it on me,
because ain't nobody hearing me.

41:33.630 --> 41:36.030
- I'm amazed you're not shut down.

41:36.030 --> 41:38.810
Freezers lined up next to a dumpster.

41:38.810 --> 41:41.820
What lives outside in those
passageways next to dumpsters?

41:41.820 --> 41:42.653
- Bats, rats, and alley cats.

41:42.653 --> 41:45.263
- Yeah, bats, rats, and mice.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.683
You are in denial.

41:48.650 --> 41:50.163
You have a big problem.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.453
You've got no idea that
this place is crumbling.

41:54.620 --> 41:56.643
And you're just going through the motions.

41:58.010 --> 42:00.170
- Mr. Ramsay, my guests want to leave.

42:00.170 --> 42:01.200
- Your guests want to leave?

42:01.200 --> 42:03.480
That's the best thing I've heard all day.

42:03.480 --> 42:05.430
Can I fucking join them?

42:05.430 --> 42:07.460
- Bye, nice meeting you.
- Bye.

42:07.460 --> 42:09.780
- Are we serving food at
all, should I let them leave?

42:09.780 --> 42:12.250
- Uh, we're in danger
of even being shut down

42:12.250 --> 42:13.670
by the health authorities,

42:13.670 --> 42:16.450
and there is no fucking
way I'm gonna stand there-

42:16.450 --> 42:17.283
- Yes, sir.

42:17.283 --> 42:20.060
- And watch this shit
be reheated and served.

42:20.060 --> 42:22.193
So sorry, we're not moving forward.

42:56.767 --> 42:58.850
- One Potato Two Potato.
