WEBVTT

00:08.740 --> 00:11.743
We're getting
a new fridge.

00:11.743 --> 00:13.119
What are you talking about,
we can't afford that.

00:13.119 --> 00:15.997
I took care of it,
they're replacing it for free.

00:15.997 --> 00:17.999
Hey, with
the money we're saving,

00:17.999 --> 00:19.125
we could lease
a gourmet truck

00:19.125 --> 00:21.503
and start selling
on the Westside.

00:21.503 --> 00:23.296
You got this whole thing
figured out, don't you?

00:23.296 --> 00:24.964
It's only
the beginning.

00:24.964 --> 00:26.174
-Ah!
-So--

00:26.174 --> 00:27.592
Anybody working here?

00:27.592 --> 00:29.177
Party of two, come on.

00:29.177 --> 00:30.303
Paulie, didn't
you already eat?

00:30.303 --> 00:31.679
No.

00:31.679 --> 00:33.181
I got this.

00:33.181 --> 00:34.974
Get your fingers
out of the chips!

00:34.974 --> 00:36.643
Get out of here.

00:38.686 --> 00:41.105
Go hang with Paulie;
I'll finish your orders.

00:43.942 --> 00:45.276
You know, having
the right outfit

00:45.276 --> 00:46.444
is half the audition.

00:46.444 --> 00:47.403
You think so?

00:47.403 --> 00:50.114
No, but you want
to stand out.

00:50.114 --> 00:51.991
Well, in that case,
let me go try this on.

00:54.452 --> 00:58.081
She is so lucky.

00:58.081 --> 01:02.168
I'd even skip church
for an audition like this.

01:02.168 --> 01:04.170
Please forgive me, Jesus.

01:04.170 --> 01:06.214
This audition
is everything.

01:06.214 --> 01:07.799
Yeah, it is
pretty cool.

01:07.799 --> 01:09.467
Pretty cool?

01:09.467 --> 01:11.553
High school dancers
never get special invites

01:11.553 --> 01:13.555
to these kinds
of auditions.

01:13.555 --> 01:16.558
Yeah, it is one hell
of an opportunity.

01:16.558 --> 01:18.476
I wish I'd
been invited.

01:18.476 --> 01:20.520
I'd so be there.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.479
Me too.

01:22.522 --> 01:23.940
What do you think?

01:23.940 --> 01:25.483
That looks hot.

01:25.483 --> 01:26.442
Yeah?

01:26.442 --> 01:28.236
Brandy, what

02:11.612 --> 02:14.157
and this is not a joke,
they're sisters.

02:14.157 --> 02:15.575
-No!
-I know!

02:15.575 --> 02:17.327
Oh, shit!

02:17.327 --> 02:18.745
-Yes.
-Yo, that's crazy.

02:18.745 --> 02:19.746
-I know.
-I'm telling you, man.

02:19.746 --> 02:21.873
-This dude.
-Oh, what is my life?

02:21.873 --> 02:23.458
Uh, guys,

02:23.458 --> 02:24.876
I actually
gotta take off,

02:24.876 --> 02:26.753
but, uh, hey, Jacob,
so nice to meet you, man.

02:26.753 --> 02:27.920
-For sure, you too, Jeremy.
-All right?

02:27.920 --> 02:29.047
I'll catch up
with you guys soon?

02:29.047 --> 02:31.215
Yeah, and I'll see you
back at the office, man.

02:31.215 --> 02:32.383
Maybe, actually
I'm meeting up

02:32.383 --> 02:34.469
with the, uh, Padrino
Tequila guys for drinks,

02:34.469 --> 02:36.471
so, eh, remember what
happened last time?

02:36.471 --> 02:38.181
Yeah, I'll get
the bail money ready.

02:38.181 --> 02:39.390
I'll call you, my man.

02:39.390 --> 02:40.600
All right, all right,
guys, take it easy.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.435
-All right, you too.
-Take care, brother.

02:42.435 --> 02:44.354
Yo, man, your boss
is pretty cool.

02:44.354 --> 02:45.271
I know.

02:45.271 --> 02:46.314
And he left
a fat tip.

02:46.314 --> 02:47.440
Hey, it's a business lunch.

02:47.440 --> 02:48.650
You just write it off.

02:48.650 --> 02:49.776
How is this
a business lunch?

02:49.776 --> 02:50.777
All we did was
just bullshit

02:50.777 --> 02:51.903
and talk about
girls and sports.

02:51.903 --> 02:53.363
At Bro Magazine,
that is the business.

02:53.363 --> 02:54.405
That's what I'm
telling you, man.

02:54.405 --> 02:56.449
That's why we're blowin'
up online right now.

02:58.284 --> 02:59.243
Oh, sh--

02:59.243 --> 03:01.579
Oh, shit,
you got the gig!

03:01.579 --> 03:04.749
Jeremy wants you to be
the new junior ad executive.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.292
-Wait, what?
-Yeah!

03:06.292 --> 03:07.377
You're telling me
that was an interview?

03:07.377 --> 03:09.170
-Yes.
-Paulie, why didn't you tell me?

03:09.170 --> 03:10.421
Because if I would
have told your ass,

03:10.421 --> 03:13.341
you would have
screwed it up.

03:13.341 --> 03:14.926
Dude, I don't even know
anything about selling ads.

03:14.926 --> 03:17.345
Selling ads, selling tacos,
it's all the same shit.

03:17.345 --> 03:18.846
It's all about
convincing somebody

03:18.846 --> 03:20.473
to buy something
they don't need,

03:20.473 --> 03:21.849
and you know
how to do that.

03:21.849 --> 03:23.726
I ain't even looking
for a job, Paulie.

03:23.726 --> 03:24.686
Like, come on.

03:24.686 --> 03:26.646
-Yeah, you are.
-What are you talking about?

03:26.646 --> 03:29.524
Bro, when you got hammered
the other night, remember?

03:29.524 --> 03:31.025
You told me you
felt bad for your dad

03:31.025 --> 03:32.693
'cause you didn't want
to run the business.

03:32.693 --> 03:34.987
And then you started
breaking down crying, and...

03:34.987 --> 03:36.823
-I wasn't crying.
-Well, you got choked up

03:36.823 --> 03:38.574
and you had mocos and shit,
but, bro, no, for real,

03:38.574 --> 03:41.577
you did tell me you
don't want to be here, so...

03:44.789 --> 03:45.832
Can I think about it?

03:45.832 --> 03:46.791
Well, better hurry up.

03:46.791 --> 03:48.501
There's a bunch of
other people up for it.

03:53.214 --> 03:54.632
Associating with
a known drug dealer

03:54.632 --> 03:56.342
when you're being
tried for trafficking?

03:56.342 --> 03:57.510
That's going to hurt.

03:57.510 --> 03:59.554
Nah, I just bumped into
this dude on the street.

03:59.554 --> 04:01.347
Who do you think
the jury's gonna believe?

04:01.347 --> 04:03.099
You or these pictures?

04:03.099 --> 04:05.184
You could be
looking at 30 years.

04:05.184 --> 04:07.395
I'm legit.

04:07.395 --> 04:10.356
M--man, I'm try--
I work, I got--

04:10.356 --> 04:12.358
I got people that
can back me up.

04:12.358 --> 04:13.359
Doesn't that
mean something?

04:13.359 --> 04:15.903
Not likely,
but we can try.

04:15.903 --> 04:18.114
Give me a list and I'll
look into some people

04:18.114 --> 04:19.782
as character witnesses.

04:19.782 --> 04:20.950
What else can we do?

04:20.950 --> 04:22.201
Trial's in a month.

04:22.201 --> 04:23.619
We can take
a chance with a jury,

04:23.619 --> 04:25.913
or you can reconsider
the plea deal.

04:25.913 --> 04:27.665
I told you I
ain't no snitch.

04:27.665 --> 04:29.917
♪

04:29.917 --> 04:31.711
You haven't been holding
your end of the deal.

04:31.711 --> 04:34.005
I got a new
assignment for you.

04:34.005 --> 04:35.298
What?

04:35.298 --> 04:37.633
Get your boy Jesus
to become an informant.

04:37.633 --> 04:39.010
He's not gonna rat.

04:39.010 --> 04:40.052
Why not?

04:40.052 --> 04:41.721
You did.

04:41.721 --> 04:43.598
You forced me.

04:43.598 --> 04:44.640
♪

04:44.640 --> 04:47.643
Fine, I'll talk
to Jesus myself.

04:47.643 --> 04:49.562
Fill him in on
our little arrangement.

04:49.562 --> 04:52.398
You're gonna get me
killed, you know that?

04:52.398 --> 04:54.233
You're sick, man.

04:54.233 --> 04:58.404
♪

04:58.404 --> 05:01.073
Okay, so I've been watching
a lot of Pia Mia's music videos,

05:01.073 --> 05:02.825
and she always
does an axel,

05:02.825 --> 05:04.368
so let's work on that.

05:08.664 --> 05:10.041
Oh, shit.

05:10.041 --> 05:11.375
God, the audition's
in a few hours.

05:11.375 --> 05:12.460
How am I gonna
get this in time?

05:12.460 --> 05:14.295
Oh, just get out
of your head.

05:14.295 --> 05:16.255
Pick something to
focus on and spot.

05:16.255 --> 05:18.966
Here, let me
show you, okay?

05:18.966 --> 05:23.513
So turn, up,
down, yeah?

05:23.513 --> 05:25.598
Let me see.

05:25.598 --> 05:27.600
All right, and...

05:27.600 --> 05:29.268
-What's up, Paulie?
-Check it out, man.

05:29.268 --> 05:31.103
This would be
your office.

05:31.103 --> 05:32.396
So what you think, man?

05:32.396 --> 05:33.439
I can't man,
I already told you,

05:33.439 --> 05:34.607
I gotta run
the taqueria.

05:34.607 --> 05:36.067
When you change
your mind?

05:36.067 --> 05:37.068
I said no.

05:37.068 --> 05:38.319
I'm a salesman, man.

05:38.319 --> 05:39.779
I never take no
for an answer.

05:39.779 --> 05:41.030
I need to know by tonight.

05:41.030 --> 05:42.448
-Later, man.
-All right, peace.

05:42.448 --> 05:43.783
(beeping)

05:43.783 --> 05:45.952
What are you
doing here?

05:45.952 --> 05:48.454
I'm picking up Gina.

05:48.454 --> 05:50.039
She's still in
there practicing.

05:50.039 --> 05:51.374
She's gonna be
there a while.

05:51.374 --> 05:54.335
You know, all she talks
about is going pro.

05:54.335 --> 05:56.045
Reminds me of you when
you were in high school.

05:56.045 --> 05:58.714
Man, that was
a while ago.

05:58.714 --> 06:01.759
Anyway, um, I'm glad to hear
that your dad's back home.

06:03.469 --> 06:06.931
Yeah, yeah,
he's doing better.

06:06.931 --> 06:09.809
Gina told me that he
gave you the taqueria.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.644
Yeah, he did.

06:11.644 --> 06:14.689
Shit, I'd be set if somebody
just handed me a business.

06:14.689 --> 06:17.817
Yeah, but Paulie just offered
me a sweet job at Bro, so.

06:17.817 --> 06:20.444
Dang, so another job
just falls into your lap?

06:22.029 --> 06:23.489
So what's the problem?

06:23.489 --> 06:25.992
Just don't want
to let my dad down.

06:25.992 --> 06:28.995
So now you're worried about
letting other people down.

06:28.995 --> 06:31.664
I guess I walked right
into that one, right?

06:31.664 --> 06:32.957
Bye, Jacob.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.335
Hey, good luck
at your audition.

06:36.335 --> 06:39.297
I'm not...

06:39.297 --> 06:40.506
Thanks.

06:44.635 --> 06:45.970
I'm so excited.

06:45.970 --> 06:46.971
You should be.

06:46.971 --> 06:48.598
You're gonna
land this job.

06:48.598 --> 06:50.349
I just gotta
perfect that axel.

06:50.349 --> 06:51.392
You will, babe.

06:51.392 --> 06:52.685
-Don't be nervous, okay?
-Okay.

06:52.685 --> 06:54.687
-You got this.
-Okay.

06:54.687 --> 06:56.355
So proud of you.

06:56.355 --> 06:58.649
Hey, Caleb,
you avoiding us?

06:58.649 --> 06:59.775
He should be.

06:59.775 --> 07:00.901
You're the competition.

07:00.901 --> 07:02.320
You got me.

07:02.320 --> 07:04.280
See you inside.

07:04.280 --> 07:05.573
-All right, babe.
-All right.

07:05.573 --> 07:07.283
-I love you.
-Thank you, I love you.

07:07.283 --> 07:08.451
Bye.

07:15.458 --> 07:17.960
(murmur of conversation)

07:19.378 --> 07:20.588
Dang, it's packed.

07:20.588 --> 07:21.964
Yeah, some of
the peeps are here

07:21.964 --> 07:23.674
from America's Next
Best Dance Crew.

07:23.674 --> 07:24.925
I'm about to show out.

07:24.925 --> 07:27.678
God, I'm getting nervous.

07:27.678 --> 07:29.347
I'm kind of glad
you're here with me.

07:29.347 --> 07:31.057
Hey, so about us...

07:31.057 --> 07:33.267
-Ceci!
-Hey!

07:33.267 --> 07:34.852
You here to support?

07:34.852 --> 07:38.314
Actually, um,
I'm here to audition.

07:38.314 --> 07:39.523
(nervous laugh)

07:40.733 --> 07:41.817
What?

07:44.737 --> 07:46.572
Who the hell
invited her?

07:46.572 --> 07:47.615
Yo, as long as
you're over 18,

07:47.615 --> 07:48.824
you don't need
an invitation.

07:48.824 --> 07:50.910
Yeah, well,
she's way over 18.

07:50.910 --> 07:51.911
Come on, man,
forget that noise.

07:51.911 --> 07:53.913
We gotta focus
on our own auditions.

07:53.913 --> 07:55.039
All right, people,
here to help me

07:55.039 --> 07:58.376
choose the dancers for
my new music video, V-dog.

07:58.376 --> 07:59.960
-Ceci!
-Hey!

07:59.960 --> 08:01.337
My girl.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.422
So glad you made it.

08:03.422 --> 08:05.424
Yeah, I didn't know
you were gonna be here.

08:05.424 --> 08:06.425
I came to help out.

08:06.425 --> 08:07.593
You should grab
a spot at the front.

08:07.593 --> 08:08.761
The choreography's
gonna start.

08:08.761 --> 08:09.679
Okay.

08:09.679 --> 08:11.430
Someone's getting
special treatment.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.557
I guess you slept with
the wrong guy at dance camp.

08:15.518 --> 08:17.770
All right, guys,
thanks for coming.

08:17.770 --> 08:18.771
We got no choice.

08:18.771 --> 08:20.523
We gotta run
away to Mexico.

08:20.523 --> 08:21.607
You don't think I
thought about that?

08:21.607 --> 08:22.858
You think I want
to go to prison?

08:22.858 --> 08:24.151
So let's go.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.113
I can't.

08:27.113 --> 08:29.407
What about you,
what about Mateo?

08:29.407 --> 08:30.783
I'm not taking
you down with me.

08:30.783 --> 08:32.576
You get caught with me,
you could get 30 years, too.

08:32.576 --> 08:34.036
Look, I'm willing
to risk it.

08:35.287 --> 08:36.372
I love you, Jesus.

08:36.372 --> 08:37.456
Oh, what's up, first you
want me to go straight,

08:37.456 --> 08:38.582
then all of a sudden
you want me to run?

08:38.582 --> 08:39.625
Like, you don't
got a chance

08:39.625 --> 08:40.626
if you don't
take that deal.

08:40.626 --> 08:42.670
Takin' no deal,
forget that.

08:42.670 --> 08:44.588
You know what
happens to snitches.

08:44.588 --> 08:46.424
At least in prison I can see
you and Mateo on the weekends.

08:46.424 --> 08:49.468
But we can be together
all the time in Mexico.

08:49.468 --> 08:50.845
I don't know, Camila.

08:53.305 --> 08:55.766
We'll take
Mateo with us.

08:55.766 --> 08:58.769
We can raise
him together.

08:58.769 --> 09:00.021
Can we do that?

09:00.021 --> 09:01.939
I'll always
have your back.

09:03.899 --> 09:05.276
We'll leave tomorrow.

10:25.606 --> 10:26.816
Thank you.

10:39.537 --> 10:41.205
Bomb Squad represent!

10:41.205 --> 10:43.415
Girl, you and me
are still in the game!

10:43.415 --> 10:45.543
Yeah, but they're still
only picking one girl.

10:50.005 --> 10:51.423
Hey, before we dig in,
why don't we, uh,

10:51.423 --> 10:53.092
give a toast to my dad?

10:53.092 --> 10:54.635
All I can say is,

10:54.635 --> 10:56.095
it's great to be home.

10:56.095 --> 10:57.638
-Salud.
-Salud.

10:57.638 --> 10:58.722
(glasses clinking)

10:58.722 --> 11:00.349
And to Maya
for this meal.

11:00.349 --> 11:01.600
Deliciosa.

11:01.600 --> 11:06.021
Ah, and for turning
down that fancy job

11:06.021 --> 11:07.773
to stay at Tio Pepe's.

11:07.773 --> 11:09.024
-Salud.
-Salud.

11:09.024 --> 11:10.734
-I'm happy to be back.
-Salud!

11:10.734 --> 11:12.403
To Santa Maya.

11:12.403 --> 11:14.446
And to my favorite sinner.

11:14.446 --> 11:15.781
Thank you.

11:15.781 --> 11:16.949
And the best news,

11:16.949 --> 11:18.826
Hernan and I picked
a day for our wedding,

11:18.826 --> 11:21.453
the 29th in
honor of my age.

11:21.453 --> 11:23.038
In dog years.

11:23.038 --> 11:24.748
So no more chips
for you, Camila.

11:24.748 --> 11:26.750
You have to fit into
your maid of honor dress.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.795
Me?

11:29.795 --> 11:31.380
I thought
you'd pick Gina.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.590
Ay, Camilita.

11:32.590 --> 11:33.883
You're my first baby.

11:33.883 --> 11:35.301
Of course it's you.

11:35.301 --> 11:37.469
And, Jesus, you have
to be there too,

11:37.469 --> 11:38.804
and your little boy Mateo?

11:38.804 --> 11:41.307
He can be
the ring bearer.

11:41.307 --> 11:42.975
You sure you want
to leave all this?

11:42.975 --> 11:43.976
Mm.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.563
Mm, these are good.

11:47.563 --> 11:49.398
You can't bail out
on your mom's wedding.

11:53.319 --> 11:55.321
I'll see them again.

11:55.321 --> 11:57.489
They can come
visit us in Mexico.

11:59.158 --> 12:00.201
Hey everybody.

12:00.201 --> 12:01.577
Oh, you made it,
just in time.

12:01.577 --> 12:03.329
How was it,
did you get it?

12:03.329 --> 12:05.289
-I made callbacks.
-Yes!

12:05.289 --> 12:07.082
-Nice.
-How about you, Eddie?

12:07.082 --> 12:10.169
Uh, I wasn't
asked to audition.

12:10.169 --> 12:12.129
Oh, okay.

12:12.129 --> 12:13.839
Listen, man,
there's plenty of food.

12:13.839 --> 12:15.132
Cool, gracias.

12:16.342 --> 12:18.260
So anyone else
you know make it?

12:18.260 --> 12:19.887
Yeah, Ceci.

12:22.181 --> 12:23.224
She did?

12:23.224 --> 12:24.892
That's great.

12:24.892 --> 12:26.101
No, one minute
she's working with me,

12:26.101 --> 12:28.520
the next she's
working against me.

12:28.520 --> 12:30.397
She had an opportunity, Gina.

12:30.397 --> 12:31.565
What?

12:31.565 --> 12:32.983
You didn't want
her to take it?

12:32.983 --> 12:34.735
Not if it screws me over.

12:34.735 --> 12:37.404
Mija, if something's
meant for you,

12:37.404 --> 12:39.573
it's gonna be yours
no matter what.

12:39.573 --> 12:41.158
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:41.158 --> 12:42.368
Thank you.

12:47.706 --> 12:49.959
What's up?

12:49.959 --> 12:51.126
Oh, nothing.

12:59.051 --> 13:00.803
Can I borrow your phone,
I left mine with Eddie.

13:02.471 --> 13:03.555
Hey.

13:03.555 --> 13:04.890
You were great yesterday.

13:04.890 --> 13:06.725
Like a mini Ceci.

13:06.725 --> 13:07.893
Thanks.

13:07.893 --> 13:09.895
Can you give us a sec?

13:09.895 --> 13:11.563
Sure.

13:11.563 --> 13:12.898
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

13:14.900 --> 13:17.236
You know, you didn't have
to send your boyfriend away.

13:17.236 --> 13:18.487
Would you stop it?

13:18.487 --> 13:20.656
Look, I don't want to be
competing against you either.

13:20.656 --> 13:22.032
Then why are you here?

13:22.032 --> 13:24.785
Because I'm trying to
be a professional dancer.

13:24.785 --> 13:26.328
Same.

13:26.328 --> 13:27.913
Then you need
to act like it.

13:27.913 --> 13:30.207
You're always gonna be
auditioning with friends, Gina.

13:30.207 --> 13:32.668
My friends tell me
when they're auditioning.

13:32.668 --> 13:34.920
It was a last
minute decision.

13:34.920 --> 13:37.589
God, if I had told you,
you wouldn't have shown up.

13:37.589 --> 13:41.385
You're right, 'cause
I don't compete with friends.

13:41.385 --> 13:44.013
Keep the personal
out of the professional.

13:46.640 --> 13:48.225
Did you tell
Vincent that?

13:51.311 --> 13:52.563
(sighs)

13:52.563 --> 13:55.649
I'm telling you, man,
you're gonna love Bro, bro.

13:55.649 --> 13:56.859
And get ready
to bust your ass,

13:56.859 --> 13:57.943
'cause you start Monday.

13:57.943 --> 13:59.319
What--Monday?

13:59.319 --> 14:00.988
Paulie, I need to give
at least two weeks, man.

14:00.988 --> 14:01.947
It's my dad.

14:01.947 --> 14:03.198
You don't work
for him anymore.

14:03.198 --> 14:05.034
Man, shut up, man.

14:05.034 --> 14:06.285
I'll figure
something out.

14:14.209 --> 14:16.336
What do you want?

if you can, uh,

14:18.297 --> 14:21.133
cover some of
my shifts for me.

14:21.133 --> 14:22.718
-Where you going?
-Oh, um,

14:22.718 --> 14:24.803
I need some
vacation days.

14:24.803 --> 14:26.305
You just started.

I'm gonna take
two of each.

of you guys,

17:06.465 --> 17:08.050
