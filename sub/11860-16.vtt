WEBVTT

00:04.625 --> 00:06.667
[grunts]
He flings him into the ropes

00:06.750 --> 00:10.291
and, oh, a devastating
clothesline.

00:12.375 --> 00:14.458
Hey, Timmy.
Your dad's
here.

00:14.542 --> 00:16.208
Do I have to go?

00:17.959 --> 00:19.125
What's up, buddy?

00:19.208 --> 00:20.583
Ready to hang
with your old man?

00:21.792 --> 00:23.208
What do you expect, Mick?

00:23.291 --> 00:24.750
You blow him off
every other
weekend.

00:24.834 --> 00:26.583
What do you expect when you
bad-mouth me the way you do?

00:26.667 --> 00:29.375
Oh, you think I'm the
reason
you two have problems?

00:29.458 --> 00:30.583
Bring Your Dad To School Day

00:30.667 --> 00:31.792
he didn't even bother asking you

00:31.875 --> 00:33.834
'cause he knew
you wouldn't
show.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.125
Is that true, Timmy?

00:39.417 --> 00:40.583
Yay!

00:45.792 --> 00:47.625
(all)
Machine! Machine! Machine!

00:50.917 --> 00:52.041
(Mick)
'You know, I would've came
to your school'

00:52.125 --> 00:53.125
if you'd told me about it.

00:53.208 --> 00:54.500
It's no big deal.

00:54.583 --> 00:56.458
Already had another
dock worker there
anyway.

00:58.208 --> 01:01.583
You give ma the money
you owe her?

01:01.667 --> 01:03.959
What are you gonna do?
Break my thumbs or somethin'?

01:05.208 --> 01:06.917
I'll take care of it.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.583
Look at your Machine now!

01:13.667 --> 01:15.500
Looks like he broke down.

01:17.000 --> 01:19.125
'You want more?'

01:19.208 --> 01:20.709
You want blood?

01:27.083 --> 01:29.166
(all)
Garbage! Garbage! Garbage!

01:30.583 --> 01:31.625
Look at that.

01:31.709 --> 01:33.542
You can bend his arm
and everything.

01:33.625 --> 01:35.000
These are pretty
cool dolls, huh?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.583
They're wrestlers.

01:38.417 --> 01:40.417
Like to see them
unload a cargo ship.

01:41.917 --> 01:43.917
Mom says dockworkers are dirty.

01:44.000 --> 01:44.917
And wrestlers ain't?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.750
Wrestlers are the coolest

01:46.834 --> 01:48.709
<i>strongest guys on the planet.</i>

01:51.583 --> 01:54.750
What, so you'd like me better
if I throw on some tights

01:54.834 --> 01:56.875
go prancing around a ring?

01:56.959 --> 01:58.750
Shut up, dad. They're cool.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.458
(all)
One, two, three.

02:19.041 --> 02:21.583
'The new WIC champion..'

02:21.667 --> 02:23.125
(all)
Machine! Machine!

02:23.208 --> 02:26.583
...Mick The Machine Malone!

02:29.291 --> 02:30.250
Yay!

03:09.250 --> 03:10.375
(Stillman)
'.44 Magnum.'

03:10.458 --> 03:12.125
Traded in during an anonymous

03:12.208 --> 03:13.917
Guns for Groceries program.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.917
It's...a cannon.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.583
A lot of
groceries
for this thing.

03:17.667 --> 03:19.125
Ballistics got a hit.

03:19.208 --> 03:22.458
The gun killed a Mick Malone,
June of '86.

03:22.542 --> 03:24.750
A dockworker.
Killed at the
pier.

03:24.834 --> 03:27.458
Yeah, Mick had a reputation
for busting kneecaps

03:27.542 --> 03:30.000
as a low-level muscle
for the Longshoremen's Union.

03:30.083 --> 03:31.333
Dangerous moonlighting.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.834
Figured Mick's death
was related, but keep reading.

03:33.917 --> 03:38.333
Mick was also a wrestler
for the WIC, indie circuit.

03:38.417 --> 03:40.291
That where Humpty Dumpty
comes in?

03:40.375 --> 03:42.083
Bear Jacobs.

03:42.166 --> 03:43.625
Gun's registered in his name.

03:43.709 --> 03:45.125
We pulled him from a match.

03:45.208 --> 03:47.375
You mean he doesn't dress
like that all the time?

03:49.166 --> 03:50.375
Waitin' forever.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.625
Eighty buck purse
I missed out on tonight.

03:52.709 --> 03:54.375
Well, you got bigger concerns,
Bear.

03:55.583 --> 03:59.375
[gasps]
You found my baby!
Where was she?

03:59.458 --> 04:01.667
You're pretty excited to own
a gun with a body on it.

04:01.750 --> 04:04.250
A body?
Hell you talkin'
about?

04:04.333 --> 04:06.250
Mick Machine Malone.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.792
In the WIC together.

04:07.875 --> 04:09.208
I didn't kill Mick.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.583
Only wrestled him
a couple of times.

04:11.667 --> 04:12.834
Crowd loved him.

04:12.917 --> 04:14.792
Then how do you explain
this whole

04:14.875 --> 04:16.667
you owning
the gun situation?

04:17.917 --> 04:19.083
I ain't had her

04:19.166 --> 04:22.166
since March of '86.

04:22.250 --> 04:24.542
And I know
exactly
where she went.

04:27.583 --> 04:29.208
Hey!

04:32.375 --> 04:34.000
You report the gun stolen, Bear?

04:34.083 --> 04:36.792
Wanted to find
the son of a bitch myself.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.917
Guy was a jobber
to the midcarders.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.125
Hired to get beat every night?

04:41.208 --> 04:42.625
Jumped around the circuits.

04:42.709 --> 04:45.667
Only got work 'cause he could
do a Commie accent.

04:45.750 --> 04:47.750
Cold War saved his ass.

04:47.834 --> 04:48.834
Now who was this guy?

04:48.917 --> 04:50.667
Red Scare.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.041
Don't know his real name.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.166
Remember where you were
when Mick got killed?

04:55.250 --> 04:57.083
Twenty-some years ago?

04:57.166 --> 04:58.291
Where were you?

04:58.375 --> 05:00.458
It was not my gun
that killed a guy.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.542
June 16th, 1986.

05:04.542 --> 05:06.083
Probably at the Traffic Light.

05:06.166 --> 05:08.875
Dated a waitress
there.
Sapphire.

05:08.959 --> 05:11.583
Well, Bear, your new ring
is gonna be a holding cell

05:11.667 --> 05:13.125
'till she vouches for you.'

05:13.208 --> 05:15.458
Might want to call
for some extra clothes.

05:16.291 --> 05:17.583
Gets chilly downstairs.

05:17.667 --> 05:19.625
Hey, when I get out..

05:19.709 --> 05:21.750
...you gonna give
me
my gun back?

05:21.834 --> 05:23.542
Yeah, I'll have it
gift wrapped for you.

06:02.834 --> 06:06.583
(Rush)
Mick The Machine Malone, 28.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.458
Day of murder,
June 16th, 1986.

06:09.542 --> 06:11.083
'Baby face of the WIC.'

06:11.166 --> 06:12.917
- Baby face?
- Good guy.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.417
Would've headlined against
other
heels as the fan favorite.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.000
Lil, apparently was
a Hulkamaniac back in the
day.

06:20.083 --> 06:21.458
(Valens)
'So, you like that nonsense?'

06:21.542 --> 06:24.625
Oh, it distracted me
for a few hours every
Saturday.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.208
Assigned talked to some
wrestlers back in '86

06:27.291 --> 06:29.458
and Lance Kotrola,
WIC's promoter.

06:29.542 --> 06:32.083
Well, Mick's last match was
ten days before he was killed

06:32.166 --> 06:33.959
against Sweet Sil Tavern.

06:34.041 --> 06:38.000
Well, Mick had a nine-year-old
son, Tim, with ex-wife, Rachel.

06:38.083 --> 06:41.291
Night Mick was murdered, she was
with Tim at the hospital.

06:41.375 --> 06:43.667
Did a midnight shift
at the local diner.

06:43.750 --> 06:45.959
I'll reach out to the son,
see what he knows.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.291
And let's pay Lance a visit too.

06:47.375 --> 06:49.792
He might know who
the Red Scare was.

06:49.875 --> 06:52.709
Hey, uh, either of you
heard from Vera?

06:52.792 --> 06:55.250
Uh, think he's tracking down
Bear's alibi.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.375
Yeah.

07:00.125 --> 07:02.000
Supposed to have
breakfast
with him

07:02.083 --> 07:04.500
but the dude never showed.

07:04.583 --> 07:06.333
Left him a couple
messages myself.

07:06.417 --> 07:08.667
He's probably just
hungover somewhere.

07:08.750 --> 07:10.083
You know what's going on
with him?

07:10.166 --> 07:12.083
Whatever it is,
he's keeping it to
himself.

07:27.375 --> 07:30.000
You were at the hospital
the night your dad died?

07:30.083 --> 07:32.333
Broke my arm playing football.

07:32.417 --> 07:34.333
Got a cast, nothing big.

07:34.417 --> 07:37.667
Your dad ever mention
a wrestler named Red Scare?

07:37.750 --> 07:39.125
Red Scare?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.709
Nah.

07:40.792 --> 07:43.709
I thought he got killed 'cause
of something he did down here.

07:43.792 --> 07:47.083
We're just, uh, looking
into a wrestling connection.

07:47.166 --> 07:49.458
Wrestling brought us closer.

07:49.542 --> 07:51.041
Brought us all closer.

07:55.458 --> 07:56.834
Look what I got for you, buddy.

07:59.458 --> 08:01.000
"Bill The Thrill!"

08:01.083 --> 08:02.542
Awesome!

08:02.625 --> 08:03.834
Yeah, don't look now but someday

08:03.917 --> 08:05.792
that's gonna
be a Mick Malone
doll.

08:05.875 --> 08:07.041
I mean, wrestler.

08:07.125 --> 08:09.458
Yeah, you wish, dad.

08:09.542 --> 08:10.709
Oh, I wish?

08:16.458 --> 08:18.166
Where did you learn that move?

08:18.250 --> 08:20.000
You know, I've been getting
in the ring a little bit.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.750
Going to this wrestling school.

08:21.834 --> 08:23.250
(Timmy)
'No way!'

08:23.333 --> 08:24.667
That's the coolest thing
I've ever heard.

08:24.750 --> 08:25.834
It's the coolest
thing
I've ever done.

08:25.917 --> 08:28.583
But you're still
unloading cargo?

08:28.667 --> 08:31.417
Yeah, I mean, I'm
not
gonna quit my job.

08:31.500 --> 08:32.792
You know, maybe
someday, right,
buddy?

08:32.875 --> 08:33.750
Yeah.

08:33.834 --> 08:34.792
I can't tell who's the adult

08:34.875 --> 08:36.000
between the two of you.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.667
Look, wrestling's honest work.

08:40.333 --> 08:41.625
It beats debt collecting.

08:41.709 --> 08:43.667
That's not saying much.

08:43.750 --> 08:45.792
What happens if you get
hurt
in the ring?

08:45.875 --> 08:47.125
Nah, it's fine.

08:47.208 --> 08:48.667
Means, it's all for show.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.083
Nobody really gets hurt.

08:50.166 --> 08:52.083
'Anyways, here.'

08:52.166 --> 08:53.417
It's, uh..

08:53.500 --> 08:54.834
It's from my first match.
It's not much.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.083
I'm just a jobber now, but..

08:57.166 --> 08:58.709
...I'll get more
if I stick with it.

09:00.709 --> 09:02.667
Okay.

09:02.750 --> 09:04.041
Great.

09:04.125 --> 09:06.583
Still need a ring name though.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.792
I was thinking maybe you could
come up with something, Timmy.

09:08.875 --> 09:11.917
Yeah, somethin' cool,
you know.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.458
Like..

09:13.542 --> 09:14.500
...The Machine.

09:14.583 --> 09:16.041
The Machine?

09:16.125 --> 09:17.458
Like you're unstoppable.

09:17.542 --> 09:21.000
Like you grind people up,
and drill 'em into the mat.

09:21.083 --> 09:23.542
See, now that's the
coolest
thing I've ever heard.

09:23.625 --> 09:25.291
You ready to hang
with your old man?

09:25.375 --> 09:27.125
Totally. Let's go.

09:28.792 --> 09:31.667
That was probably the
happiest
time from when I was a kid.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.041
My dad coming back
in my life like
that.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.542
You know any of the wrestlers
your dad hung out with?

09:36.625 --> 09:40.125
No, mom never let me go
to any of his matches.

09:40.208 --> 09:44.333
But I got every bootleg tape
I can find with him on it.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.542
Mind if I take a look at those?

09:45.625 --> 09:47.208
Be my guest.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.750
You know, I'm pretty
sure
the only reason

09:48.834 --> 09:50.125
he got in the ring was..

09:52.250 --> 09:53.458
...because of me.

09:58.166 --> 10:00.125
Quite an operation, Lance.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.333
That chair you're in,
ten grand.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.875
Yeah, you know,
the WWE, they had these

10:06.959 --> 10:10.000
perfect, polished little
matches back in the 80s

10:10.083 --> 10:13.125
and I said screw that with
two words, garbage wrestling.

10:13.208 --> 10:16.166
I guess bloodlust is where
it's at, even if it's fake.

10:16.250 --> 10:18.417
Well, my matches
may be predetermined

10:18.500 --> 10:19.875
but they're far from fake.

10:19.959 --> 10:23.375
Athletes have to have pretty
big
brass ones to rep the WIC.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.792
Guys like Mick Malone?

10:24.875 --> 10:26.375
Is that what this is all about?

10:26.458 --> 10:28.709
Well, Mick stopped
wrestling
ten days before he died

10:28.792 --> 10:30.917
after his match with Sil Tavern.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.583
Why was he off the card?

10:32.667 --> 10:33.875
Kayfabe.

10:33.959 --> 10:36.041
You know, keeping up
appearances outside of the
ring.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.792
Acting,
more time off to..

10:38.875 --> 10:40.959
...build hype for a feud.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.166
Sil and Mick have any
real beef behind the
scenes?

10:43.250 --> 10:46.166
Please. Someone in the family
does well, we all do well.

10:46.250 --> 10:47.834
Red Scare part of that family?

10:47.917 --> 10:50.959
Are you kidding? I fired that
crackhead over 20 years ago.

10:51.041 --> 10:52.792
'He got a real name?'

10:52.875 --> 10:54.083
Nate Beecher.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.000
What was the deal
with him and Mick?

10:56.083 --> 10:58.500
Well, they were both jobbers,
trying to move up the ranks

10:58.583 --> 11:01.542
but Mick was a natural
at what mattered most.

11:03.667 --> 11:06.792
(Sil)
'Not only am I the champion'

11:06.875 --> 11:10.542
but I also have the greatest
title of them all..

11:12.500 --> 11:14.500
...The Sweet One.

11:14.583 --> 11:16.667
Men are honored

11:16.750 --> 11:18.417
to lose to Sil Tavern.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.375
'Then they can run
to their girlfriends'

11:20.458 --> 11:22.208
and tell them
they were just beaten

11:22.291 --> 11:24.291
by the prettiest there ever was.

11:26.250 --> 11:28.083
Oh, and ladies..

11:28.166 --> 11:30.375
...if you notice, this face..

11:32.166 --> 11:33.208
...not a scratch on it.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.834
[laughs]
Cut.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.208
Superb.

11:38.291 --> 11:40.959
Okay, who's next?

11:41.041 --> 11:44.250
You, Red Scare,
let's see what you got.

11:48.834 --> 11:50.458
I Red Scare.

11:50.542 --> 11:52.792
My dropkicks like missiles
from Gorbachev.

11:52.875 --> 11:54.834
(Lance)
'Cut. Lame.'

11:54.917 --> 11:57.291
Anybody with some freakin'
personality here, please.

12:03.583 --> 12:05.959
Well, let me tell you
something, Lance.

12:06.041 --> 12:10.917
When the big boss man
in the sky created The Machine

12:11.000 --> 12:12.625
he gave me one job

12:12.709 --> 12:16.125
crushing punks
like sissy Sil Tavern.

12:16.208 --> 12:20.208
And until you're in
that driller slam

12:20.291 --> 12:22.875
and you hear that one

12:22.959 --> 12:24.959
two, three

12:25.041 --> 12:26.792
'I'll be putting in overtime.'

12:26.875 --> 12:29.542
So get ready all you
gearheads out there

12:29.625 --> 12:34.333
'cause The Machine
is going to work!

12:34.417 --> 12:35.542
Yay!

12:35.625 --> 12:37.000
What do you think,
you're better than
me?

12:46.417 --> 12:48.834
Mick had headliner
written all over him.

12:48.917 --> 12:52.959
Red Scare, just a jealous
loser
that I kicked to the curb.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.083
Know where he is now?

12:54.166 --> 12:55.709
Last I heard
that 'mo was mastering

12:55.792 --> 12:58.750
the fine art of cot wrestling
with his cell mate.

13:00.250 --> 13:04.417
Must have sucked being
the Detroit Lions of
wrestling.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.000
Huh, Red Scare?

13:06.083 --> 13:08.083
I was a good wrestler.

13:08.166 --> 13:10.834
No one did the Russian like me.

13:10.917 --> 13:13.542
Too bad you couldn't
be
as good a criminal.

13:13.625 --> 13:14.792
Rap sheet a mile long.

13:14.875 --> 13:16.125
Always getting pinched.

13:16.208 --> 13:18.583
You steal that?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.250
Doesn't look familiar.

13:20.333 --> 13:23.792
- Not what Bear says.
- I don't know a Bear.

13:23.875 --> 13:25.375
How about a Machine?

13:26.667 --> 13:28.625
You know Mick Malone?

13:28.709 --> 13:29.917
Nope.

13:30.000 --> 13:32.291
Well, then you must have
hit your head pretty good

13:32.375 --> 13:34.875
when he slammed you
to the ground like a rag doll.

13:36.750 --> 13:38.125
What's your point with all this?

13:38.208 --> 13:41.917
Look, we'll go slow,
so try to keep up.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.709
This .44 is the gun
that killed Mick.

13:45.792 --> 13:49.208
If you don't talk,
slap the gun theft on you

13:49.291 --> 13:51.417
you've got another seven years.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.166
Even more for Mick's murder.

13:56.083 --> 14:00.375
Well,
hypothetically,
if I'd taken Bear's
gun

14:00.458 --> 14:01.834
imagine it had some worth

14:01.917 --> 14:04.083
so I wouldn't have kept
it
more than a few weeks.

14:04.166 --> 14:08.458
[sighs]
Hypothetically, what
might
you have done with it?

14:08.542 --> 14:10.291
Traded it for some stuff.

14:10.375 --> 14:11.291
What kind of stuff?

14:11.375 --> 14:13.583
Well, steroids, hypothetically.

14:13.667 --> 14:16.542
And I would have sent it
to this guy, Sil Tavern.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.250
Known for the good juice.

14:18.333 --> 14:20.709
Sent? Like, in the mail?

14:20.792 --> 14:22.667
Might have been in Tampa
at the time.

14:22.750 --> 14:27.750
Alright, you sent a gun
through the mail?

14:27.834 --> 14:29.208
Hypothetically.

14:31.834 --> 14:34.083
But I made him sign for it.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.125
I ain't stupid.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.166
Bottom line, I didn't
have that gun, Sil did.

14:58.041 --> 15:01.041
- Ooh, good one.
- 'Thank you.'

15:01.125 --> 15:03.166
Thanks.
I appreciate it, guys.

15:06.041 --> 15:08.834
- Sweet Sil Tavern.
- Yeah.

15:08.917 --> 15:10.667
I saw you wrestle
when I was a kid.

15:10.750 --> 15:11.875
Yeah, well,
this is just
temporary.

15:11.959 --> 15:13.250
I'll be back in the ring soon.

15:13.333 --> 15:16.041
Alright, pic,
two for ten, both of you.

15:16.125 --> 15:17.333
Maybe later.

15:19.333 --> 15:21.667
You ever own a .44 Magnum?

15:21.750 --> 15:23.125
I used to work security, but..

15:23.208 --> 15:24.333
...I never needed
a piece like that.

15:24.417 --> 15:25.709
Well, took us forever

15:25.792 --> 15:28.291
to find this
stupid tracking
slip

15:28.375 --> 15:30.041
and now you're gonna lie?

15:30.125 --> 15:31.667
It's a .44 Magnum.

15:31.750 --> 15:32.792
Sent from Nate Beecher.

15:32.875 --> 15:35.083
It was the gun
that killed Mick Malone.

15:35.166 --> 15:37.458
Mick Malone.
We were good friends.

15:37.542 --> 15:40.083
The more we beat each other up,
the closer we've gotten.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.000
Rivalry ever spill
outside the ring?

15:45.083 --> 15:46.500
No way.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.542
We had a great thing going. You
know, Lance worked it all out.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.083
We were the perfect
baby face/heel combination.

15:51.166 --> 15:52.500
So what about the gun?

15:52.583 --> 15:54.709
I got it from Nate,
but I sold it right after.

15:54.792 --> 15:55.875
To who?

15:57.333 --> 15:59.333
Well, to Mick actually.

15:59.417 --> 16:03.041
So you just happened
to sell it to the dead
guy?

16:03.125 --> 16:05.125
Yeah, I didn't need it.

16:05.208 --> 16:07.041
I gave him a deal on it.

16:07.125 --> 16:12.083
Mick said something about doing
side jobs, extra cash like that.

16:12.166 --> 16:14.542
- Debt collecting?
- Maybe.

16:14.625 --> 16:15.834
'Indies don't pay much.'

16:15.917 --> 16:18.458
Mick was just trying
to take care of his son.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.333
Did whatever it took
for his family.

16:22.792 --> 16:24.041
(Lance)
It's our first garbage match

16:24.125 --> 16:25.875
so we're gonna need
to sell it, okay?

16:25.959 --> 16:27.709
Sil is gonna get a club
with barbed wire

16:27.792 --> 16:29.041
out from under the ring.

16:29.125 --> 16:30.583
- Barbed wire?
- 'Okay, Mick.'

16:30.667 --> 16:32.542
You wince with every shot.
You're in pain.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.500
But the moment you duck,
the tides are turned.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.166
You hit Sil
and he drops the club.

16:36.250 --> 16:38.166
I don't see what we need
all this garbage stuff for.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.750
I'm tired of people
saying we're fake.

16:39.834 --> 16:41.542
Okay, they want real,
we'll give 'em real.

16:41.625 --> 16:43.917
We'll blow the WWF
out of the freakin' water.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.625
I told my kid I'd bring him
to the match tonight.

16:47.709 --> 16:49.625
- Watch his father win the
belt.
- So?

16:49.709 --> 16:53.083
So I don't want my kid seeing
me
all cut up with barbed wire.

16:53.166 --> 16:55.458
Well, I guess you'll bring him
to a different match, won't
you?

16:57.041 --> 17:01.041
Look, don't tell me
what to do with my
kid.

17:01.125 --> 17:03.333
- You wanna wrestle or not?
- 'Hey, hey, guys.'

17:03.417 --> 17:05.083
We're cool.

17:05.166 --> 17:08.792
Lance, you know, I was
talking about the TV deal.

17:08.875 --> 17:10.250
'This feud will get it.'

17:11.166 --> 17:14.250
And, Mick, your kid, right?

17:14.333 --> 17:16.083
'Do some garbage.'

17:16.166 --> 17:18.250
This works out,
you can quit the docks.

17:18.333 --> 17:19.458
Get him whatever he wants.

17:22.709 --> 17:24.375
Fine.

17:24.458 --> 17:27.208
Alright. Alright.

17:27.291 --> 17:29.166
Take that adrenaline
into the ring, huh?

17:33.667 --> 17:36.583
Just...with the club

17:36.667 --> 17:38.250
hit me in the
back
instead of the
face.

17:38.333 --> 17:39.792
Yeah, yeah, man, no problem.

17:46.417 --> 17:47.458
I get what Mick
was going through

17:47.542 --> 17:49.417
trying to be a good dad.

17:49.500 --> 17:50.667
I got a son too, I..

17:51.792 --> 17:53.625
I'd do anything for him.

17:53.709 --> 17:55.583
Mick and Lance butt heads often?

17:55.667 --> 17:57.417
Don't see why they would have.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.125
We all got our TV deal
right after that

17:59.208 --> 18:01.000
and everybody was happy.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.041
Do you remember where
you were when Mick got shot?

18:03.125 --> 18:05.875
Yeah, um,
I was out with the boys.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.458
We had a card that night.

18:07.542 --> 18:09.041
You got any names?

18:09.125 --> 18:10.542
I'm sure I could drum 'em up.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.709
Well, you're gonna have
to come with us till you do.

18:12.792 --> 18:17.208
Look, could it not be here
in front of the fans?

18:17.291 --> 18:18.709
'Only got a few minutes left.'

18:20.208 --> 18:22.041
Sorry, Sil. Let's go.

18:22.875 --> 18:24.333
Oh, come on.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.792
Talked to Sapphire
from the Traffic Light.

18:28.709 --> 18:30.333
Broke up with Bear in '82.

18:30.417 --> 18:32.125
Well, the guy was
only four years off.

18:32.208 --> 18:33.792
Ain't the only
thing
he was off about.

18:33.875 --> 18:36.208
Turns out he and Mick
collected debts
together

18:36.291 --> 18:37.917
for the Longshoremen.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.375
Any info on
that
traveling gun?

18:40.458 --> 18:42.667
I found who donated it
to Guns for Groceries

18:42.750 --> 18:44.458
off surveillance
at the grocery store.

18:44.542 --> 18:45.875
Jordan Pope.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.000
Lived in Alaska
through June of '86.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.667
Well, he couldn't
be
our doer then.

18:49.750 --> 18:53.041
Said he found the gun
in Juniata Park, fall of '86

18:53.125 --> 18:54.417
a few months after the murder.

19:05.750 --> 19:07.667
You okay, Belen?

19:09.083 --> 19:10.542
What's wrong?

19:10.625 --> 19:11.792
I saw him.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.083
Have a seat.

19:20.750 --> 19:22.750
The scum who assaulted you?

19:22.834 --> 19:24.208
Where?

19:24.291 --> 19:28.625
He was mowing a lawn
in my neighborhood.

21:22.792 --> 21:24.500
(female #1)
'I called the police.'

21:26.166 --> 21:27.458
They're already here.

21:38.333 --> 21:39.500
Morning.

21:44.125 --> 21:45.417
What happened, Scotty?

21:46.792 --> 21:48.000
Uh..

21:48.959 --> 21:51.875
I had to...make an arrest.

21:51.959 --> 21:53.417
Guy put up
a little resistance.

21:54.500 --> 21:56.458
Everything on the up-and-up?

21:56.542 --> 21:57.458
Oh, yeah.

21:57.542 --> 21:59.041
Yeah, no worries.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.417
'Go get checked out,
cleaned up'

22:00.500 --> 22:02.333
'and we'll talk
about it later on.'

22:02.417 --> 22:03.500
Sure thing.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.625
Now, Scotty.

22:17.417 --> 22:18.917
(Rush)
Hey.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.250
You okay?

22:20.333 --> 22:21.667
You should see the other guy.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.667
This have to do with, um..

22:26.417 --> 22:27.834
Did you get him?

22:27.917 --> 22:28.959
Yeah.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.208
You forgot to mention
that you and Mick

22:35.291 --> 22:37.917
worked together,
muscle for the union.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.458
Makes me look bad.

22:39.542 --> 22:42.709
Well, not as bad as
your alibi going south, Bear.

22:42.792 --> 22:45.375
Sapphire dumped you
way before '86.

22:45.458 --> 22:47.125
What difference does it make?

22:47.208 --> 22:49.000
Didn't you find the Red Scare?

22:49.875 --> 22:51.417
It was your gun.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.166
'You and Mick collecting debts.'

22:54.667 --> 22:55.875
Where did it go wrong?

22:57.750 --> 22:59.208
Night Mick was killed..

23:02.709 --> 23:04.625
...check Spank-Me Escorts.

23:05.625 --> 23:06.792
Okay.

23:07.709 --> 23:09.125
Mick looked out for me.

23:09.208 --> 23:10.625
Got me the job wrestling.

23:10.709 --> 23:11.959
But..

23:12.041 --> 23:13.959
...his troubles
went beyond the
mat.

23:16.208 --> 23:17.750
(Mick)
'Look, I told you
what happened.'

23:17.834 --> 23:19.959
(Rachel)
What kind of a person
does that? You bastard!

23:20.041 --> 23:22.792
Why, because I want Timmy to see
his dad good at somethin'?

23:22.875 --> 23:24.250
Last time
you'll see him at all.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.625
No, no, you're not
taking him away from
me.

23:26.709 --> 23:28.208
We'll see about that.

23:29.667 --> 23:31.291
Timmy..

23:31.375 --> 23:32.792
Timmy, I'm fine, okay?

23:32.875 --> 23:35.166
I'm fine, buddy.
Hey, it's all pretend.

23:35.250 --> 23:36.792
I'll see you soon.

23:36.875 --> 23:38.917
Okay? I'll see you soon.

23:39.041 --> 23:40.166
Rachel..

23:47.667 --> 23:48.875
What was the fight about?

23:48.959 --> 23:50.125
'No idea.'

23:50.208 --> 23:53.125
But if Mick's ex
thought
he'd give up his kid

23:53.208 --> 23:54.500
she had another thing coming.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.333
(Jeffries)
'Just spent an exhilarating
time down at family court.'

23:59.417 --> 24:01.125
Yeah, you bond
with the city workers?

24:01.208 --> 24:03.166
Yeah, Rachel
filed
for sole custody

24:03.250 --> 24:05.834
four days
before Mick's
murder.

24:05.917 --> 24:08.875
Said Mick hung around
some unsavory folk.

24:08.959 --> 24:11.166
The wrestlers or dockworkers?

24:11.250 --> 24:13.542
She also claims
Mick abandoned Tim

24:13.625 --> 24:15.458
in a warehouse in Baltimore

24:15.542 --> 24:17.000
the night of his last match.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.458
Alright, let's get her in here.

24:18.542 --> 24:20.542
- Miller's picking her up
now.
- Yeah, Tim too.

24:20.625 --> 24:22.625
We'll see what was going
on
in that family.

24:29.792 --> 24:31.917
Hey, Valens around?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.417
Um, no.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.041
I'm his partner.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.375
Uh, you're from Central, right?

24:36.458 --> 24:38.208
Yeah, Detective Pierson.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.291
Uh, saw you did
the search warrant, uh

24:40.375 --> 24:42.041
after Scotty made
that arrest last night.

24:42.125 --> 24:43.709
Yeah, my case initially.

24:43.792 --> 24:45.750
Guess Detective Valens
had a beat

24:45.834 --> 24:48.834
went to the scumbag's
place,
nobody answered.

24:48.917 --> 24:51.959
But, you know,
the door was already
ajar.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.208
He heard some noises,
went in to investigate

24:54.291 --> 24:56.917
and found the IDs.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.208
Yeah, yeah,
that's what I figured.

24:59.291 --> 25:00.417
Hmm.

25:01.667 --> 25:03.166
What went wrong, Rachel?

25:04.667 --> 25:06.500
We had Tim young.

25:06.583 --> 25:07.542
Drifted apart.

25:07.625 --> 25:09.041
Mick violent with you guys?

25:09.125 --> 25:10.417
No.

25:10.500 --> 25:13.583
He just had no clue
what being a real father
was.

25:13.667 --> 25:14.834
What do you mean?

25:14.917 --> 25:17.083
Well, his father was
up
in Graterford.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.083
I guess he realized that..

25:19.166 --> 25:21.875
...he was heading down
the same path with Tim.

25:21.959 --> 25:23.583
'Not really being a father.'

25:23.667 --> 25:25.083
Tried to turn it around.

25:25.166 --> 25:28.041
That's not what you thought
when you filed for sole
custody.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.125
You said..

25:30.208 --> 25:33.750
...that he got Tim out
of school, took him to
Baltimore

25:33.834 --> 25:35.166
then left him there.

25:35.250 --> 25:36.875
It took me two hours

25:36.959 --> 25:39.291
<i>to drive up there</i>
<i>and get him.</i>

25:39.375 --> 25:42.208
<i>I found him in a warehouse..</i>

25:42.291 --> 25:43.625
...all by himself.

25:44.667 --> 25:46.333
Mick tell you what happened?

25:46.417 --> 25:48.500
He said he got hurt
in the match.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.709
But unless you're dead..

25:52.208 --> 25:53.834
...it's no excuse, right?

25:55.000 --> 25:56.917
That's a lot of time and money

25:57.000 --> 25:58.417
to get sole custody.

26:00.333 --> 26:02.458
Enough to make you wanna take
matters into your own hands?

26:02.542 --> 26:04.333
I was working
the night Mick was
killed.

26:04.417 --> 26:06.000
- Check it out.
- I did.

26:06.083 --> 26:08.291
You took a two-hour break.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.792
Right around the time
Mick was shot.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.208
I snuck off to see my son.

26:14.959 --> 26:16.417
He was in the hospital.

26:16.500 --> 26:18.375
For a broken arm.

26:18.458 --> 26:20.083
Broken arm?
Who told you
that?

26:21.083 --> 26:24.166
He was in a coma
for five days.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.375
A coma? Why?

26:27.458 --> 26:29.375
Look, ma had nothing
to do with it, okay?

26:29.458 --> 26:31.583
You see her tell your dad
to stay away from you?

26:31.667 --> 26:34.583
So people argue,
you know? So what?

26:34.667 --> 26:36.875
Well, it's not exactly
the image you painted earlier.

26:36.959 --> 26:40.417
'You never said she filed
for sole custody.'

26:40.500 --> 26:43.917
Sole custody?
I-I didn't know
that.

26:44.000 --> 26:48.625
What happened when he left you
alone in that warehouse?

26:48.709 --> 26:52.000
Look, I was just trying to
wrap
my head around it all, okay?

26:52.083 --> 26:53.667
Around what?

26:53.750 --> 26:55.500
My dad told me it was all fake.

26:58.250 --> 26:59.250
Yay!

27:00.250 --> 27:01.291
'Yay!'

27:10.875 --> 27:13.000
(all)
Machine! Machine!

27:13.083 --> 27:15.792
Machine! Machine! Machine!

27:15.875 --> 27:19.875
Machine! Machine!
Machine! Machine!

27:19.959 --> 27:21.041
Yay!

27:23.375 --> 27:25.291
Yay!

27:26.834 --> 27:28.291
Yay!

27:28.375 --> 27:30.291
(all)
Machine! Machine!

27:30.375 --> 27:33.375
Machine! Machine!
Machine! Machine!

27:33.458 --> 27:36.000
Machine! Machine! Machine!

27:36.083 --> 27:37.458
Machine! Machine! Machine!

27:41.875 --> 27:43.208
He's going for the belt.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.458
If he gets there,
he retains the title.

27:59.041 --> 28:02.000
(all)
Machine! Machine!
Machine! Machine!

28:04.834 --> 28:05.875
Oh!

28:20.709 --> 28:23.583
The new WIC champion..

28:23.667 --> 28:27.834
...Sweet Sil Tavern!

29:00.291 --> 29:01.333
Dad..

29:03.041 --> 29:04.083
Dad!

29:05.458 --> 29:06.500
Yeah.

29:07.375 --> 29:10.333
I thought he was dead.

29:10.417 --> 29:12.917
'Then I saw him at the docks'

29:13.000 --> 29:14.917
and he said he was okay.

29:15.000 --> 29:17.709
'It was all just pretend.'

29:17.792 --> 29:19.792
I-I tried to tell him that..

29:21.250 --> 29:23.291
...sometimes people get hurt.

29:25.250 --> 29:27.542
Well, we-we got
in an argument about
it.

29:28.834 --> 29:29.750
When?

29:29.834 --> 29:31.333
After seeing Mick at the docks.

29:31.417 --> 29:33.500
The night Tim went
to the hospital?

29:33.583 --> 29:34.542
'Yeah.'

29:34.625 --> 29:36.291
'He couldn't understand'

29:36.375 --> 29:39.709
why his father would tell
him
something that wasn't
true.

29:41.000 --> 29:42.667
'And he, um..'

29:42.750 --> 29:44.625
...he went to his room and..

29:47.417 --> 29:48.834
Then I heard it..

29:51.083 --> 29:52.583
..footsteps on the roof.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.250
Timmy?

29:56.333 --> 29:57.375
Tim!

30:02.625 --> 30:03.750
I, uh..

30:05.834 --> 30:07.458
I shouldn't have fought so hard

30:07.542 --> 30:09.375
to keep them apart, you know?

30:11.291 --> 30:13.834
'I mean, maybe if..'

30:13.917 --> 30:16.166
'If Mick could have talked
to him, you know..'

30:18.458 --> 30:19.667
He just..

30:21.667 --> 30:23.500
He wanted to be like his dad.

30:26.792 --> 30:29.375
I found the video
from Mick's last
match.

30:33.458 --> 30:36.375
If Mick knew
that stunt was
coming

30:36.458 --> 30:38.250
would he have brought his
kid
to that match?

30:38.333 --> 30:41.166
He spent 12 hours in the ER
after that fall.

30:41.250 --> 30:43.709
"Acute axial compression."

30:43.792 --> 30:46.083
It's when the vertebrae mash
together, right?

30:46.166 --> 30:48.083
(Rush)
'Could have been paralyzed
for life.'

30:48.166 --> 30:49.250
Now check this out.

30:49.333 --> 30:50.709
Right after the match..

30:53.333 --> 30:54.667
Get that out of my face.

30:57.542 --> 30:58.750
I ain't gonna tell you again.

30:58.834 --> 31:01.417
Oh, it's a .44 Magnum.

31:01.500 --> 31:04.750
Sold it to Mick, my ass.
Sil had it the whole time.

31:04.834 --> 31:06.083
Let's get him out from holding.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.417
Lance too.

31:07.500 --> 31:08.917
He forgot to mention his..

31:09.000 --> 31:11.542
...star wrestler
nearly broke his
neck.

31:13.667 --> 31:14.834
Um, Scotty.

31:19.625 --> 31:20.667
Um..

31:24.375 --> 31:26.625
Pierson found this
under the radiator.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.667
He didn't want it to get
mixed up in the reports.

31:38.875 --> 31:41.208
Look, anything you need on
this,
Scotty, whatever it is..

31:43.208 --> 31:44.250
...you got it.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.667
Thanks, Lil.

31:59.166 --> 32:02.500
Out with the boys
when Mick died, hmm?

32:02.583 --> 32:04.291
Yeah, the names you gave
us,
uh, well..

32:04.375 --> 32:06.834
One's in Japan
and the rest are all
dead.

32:06.917 --> 32:09.834
In our business, if you make
it
to 50, you're a survivor.

32:09.917 --> 32:11.458
Well, Mick didn't make it to 30.

32:11.542 --> 32:13.083
When did you sell
him
that .44 again?

32:13.166 --> 32:14.625
A couple months before he died.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.667
Get that out of my face.

32:22.667 --> 32:24.333
I ain't gonna tell you again.

32:24.417 --> 32:26.709
Match was from ten days
before Mick was killed.

32:26.792 --> 32:28.625
Right after you threw
him
off a scaffold.

32:28.709 --> 32:30.417
I must have sold it to him
later than I thought.

32:30.500 --> 32:31.667
Don't lie to me, Sil.

32:31.750 --> 32:35.250
If Mick's gone,
you stay
champion.

32:35.333 --> 32:36.959
I didn't kill him.

32:37.041 --> 32:39.917
But you got no problem throwing
him on his head from 20 feet up.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.125
Your idea to go off script?

32:42.208 --> 32:43.375
- No.
- Lance's?

32:43.458 --> 32:45.083
- No, I mean--
- You mean what?

32:45.166 --> 32:46.458
I didn't go off script.

32:46.542 --> 32:48.583
So Mick brings his
kid
to the one match

32:48.667 --> 32:50.375
that he's supposed to lose?

32:50.458 --> 32:51.667
That was an accident.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.709
We got Lance in the next room.

32:56.959 --> 32:58.583
Any bets he'll throw
you
under the bus?

32:59.709 --> 33:02.041
What do I care
if Sil's in the other room?

33:02.125 --> 33:03.417
This has nothing
to do with me.

33:04.959 --> 33:06.375
God, you're wastin'
your time here.

33:06.458 --> 33:08.583
Trust me, there's a
lot
I'd rather do

33:08.667 --> 33:10.500
than talk to you, assclown.

33:10.583 --> 33:12.542
[sighs]
Assclown?

33:12.625 --> 33:16.500
Who in this room owns
a multimillion dollar empire?

33:17.792 --> 33:20.625
Raise that hand
again,
you'll lower a stub.

33:20.709 --> 33:24.583
FYI, the WIC attorney's been
notified for Sil as well.

33:24.667 --> 33:26.166
We'll let you
know
when he calls.

33:26.250 --> 33:28.333
Why do you need a lawyer?
You've something to hide?

33:28.417 --> 33:30.625
It's my right, detective.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.417
Saw a tape of, uh,
Mick
flying through that
table.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.166
- Mm-hmm.
- It's cool stunt.

33:35.250 --> 33:36.583
Yeah, first of many.

33:36.667 --> 33:38.375
You get your TV deal
after that match?

33:38.458 --> 33:39.458
I sure did.

33:39.542 --> 33:42.375
So really,
everything you
got

33:42.458 --> 33:43.583
is because of Sil.

33:43.667 --> 33:46.417
- Excuse me?
- Sil was a genius.

33:46.500 --> 33:48.041
It was his idea, right?

33:48.125 --> 33:49.750
Throwing Mick off that scaffold?

33:49.834 --> 33:53.250
Ideas don't happen
unless they come from my brain.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.917
I am the WIC.

33:55.000 --> 33:57.875
Uh, you seem like
a leech promoter to
me.

33:57.959 --> 34:01.458
Every move, every grunt,
every punch in that ring

34:01.542 --> 34:02.750
that's me.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.583
I create everything.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.125
Including Mick's fall?

34:11.834 --> 34:12.917
Somethin' funny?

34:13.000 --> 34:14.625
I can't believe
I almost fell for that.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.458
The good cop, bad cop.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.458
'You two ought to be
tag team partners.'

34:18.542 --> 34:20.250
Mick must have been real pissed

34:20.333 --> 34:23.000
about that fall you created.

34:23.083 --> 34:26.208
He come talk to you
after he could walk
again?

34:26.291 --> 34:28.458
I think I'm just
gonna wait for my lawyer.

34:28.542 --> 34:29.750
Is that okay with you?

34:31.166 --> 34:33.500
Lawyer for the WIC.

34:33.583 --> 34:37.041
Well, you can't rep
Lance and Sil. Pick one.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.583
Lance.

34:39.667 --> 34:41.333
Well, how do I know
you're a lawyer?

34:41.417 --> 34:42.542
You could be anybody.

34:44.375 --> 34:46.166
Doin' some digging on Sil.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.500
Anything I could find.

34:47.583 --> 34:48.667
No felonies, but..

34:48.750 --> 34:49.875
A fender bender.

34:49.959 --> 34:51.667
Twenty minutes
after Mick's murder.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.208
Check out the location.

34:53.291 --> 34:54.542
Wyoming Avenue.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.166
That's right near Juniata Park.

34:56.250 --> 34:59.166
That's, what, about
ten minutes from the docks?

34:59.250 --> 35:01.166
Sil had a passenger with him.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.166
Guess who?

35:03.250 --> 35:04.667
(Valens)
'Uh, they were together'

35:04.750 --> 35:07.000
the night Mick was murdered?

35:07.083 --> 35:08.500
So who pulled the trigger?

35:08.583 --> 35:10.375
Lawyers are on their way.

35:10.458 --> 35:12.583
Got about ten minutes
to figure it out.

35:12.667 --> 35:14.792
You ever been
to Juniata Park, Sil?

35:14.875 --> 35:16.208
Um..

35:16.291 --> 35:18.000
Uh, it's not a,
not a trick question.

35:18.083 --> 35:19.959
It's just that you were
in an accident out there

35:20.041 --> 35:21.709
uh, the night
that Mick was killed.

35:22.750 --> 35:24.083
Why were you with Lance?

35:25.500 --> 35:27.000
Mick was your friend.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.834
You're both single parents

35:28.917 --> 35:32.667
doin' whatever it took
to take care of your kids.

35:32.750 --> 35:33.875
We had a lot in common.

35:33.959 --> 35:35.125
Yeah, that's strange

35:35.208 --> 35:36.959
'cause that-that isn't
what Adam said.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.083
'Your son.'

35:40.166 --> 35:41.542
'Yeah, I tracked him down.'

35:41.625 --> 35:43.792
You haven't seen
him
in a while, huh?

35:43.875 --> 35:45.375
I see him when I can.

35:45.458 --> 35:47.333
Every 15 years?

35:47.417 --> 35:48.542
You must not try very hard.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.083
I mean,
he's right here in
Philly.

35:50.166 --> 35:51.792
I'd do anything for my son.

35:52.792 --> 35:54.041
Except stick around.

35:55.125 --> 35:57.500
'See, you preach about family.'

35:57.583 --> 36:03.208
But it's Mick who was the one
who was trying to be a good
dad.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.041
But don't you think
his son deserves to know

36:08.125 --> 36:09.375
what happened to him?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.417
I went to see Mick that night.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.458
Where? At the docks?

36:17.542 --> 36:19.166
I heard what happened
to his kid.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.208
I went to the hospital.

36:23.291 --> 36:24.417
<i>(Rush)</i>
<i>With Lance?</i>

36:24.500 --> 36:27.125
<i>(Sil)</i>
<i>No. Alone.</i>

36:28.417 --> 36:29.917
<i>I told him that..</i>

36:30.000 --> 36:31.458
...I was sorry for the match.

36:32.750 --> 36:34.000
For hurtin' him.

36:35.208 --> 36:36.583
But Lance was gonna..

36:36.667 --> 36:38.583
...promote the hell
out of the rematch.

36:38.667 --> 36:40.083
We'd both get rich, you know?

36:40.166 --> 36:44.083
So, you leave the hospital,
and Mick's still alive?

36:44.166 --> 36:46.709
Then you hook up with Lance..

36:46.792 --> 36:47.750
...he's dead.

36:47.834 --> 36:49.875
Lance gave me my career.

36:49.959 --> 36:51.667
And without Lance,
I'd be nothin'.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.917
You're living off
of ten dollar autographs.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.208
Uh, he's gonna get me
back in the ring soon.

36:57.291 --> 37:00.208
I'm only one match away
from bein' on top again.

37:01.875 --> 37:05.375
When are you gonna wake up
from the spell of that guy,
Sil?

37:06.792 --> 37:09.291
- Lawyer call yet?
- Not yet.

37:09.375 --> 37:10.959
In the meantime,
thought you could tell us

37:11.041 --> 37:13.458
what you were doing
in Sil's car in Juniata
Park

37:13.542 --> 37:15.041
the night Mick was killed.

37:15.125 --> 37:17.250
I'm sure my attorney
would love to do it.

37:17.333 --> 37:19.166
Why don't you go
<i>ese?</i>

37:22.208 --> 37:24.375
Good cop, get out.

37:24.458 --> 37:26.041
Wait, wait,
where are you going?

37:27.125 --> 37:28.917
See if your lawyer called.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.250
Whoa, wait a minute!

37:30.333 --> 37:32.125
Look, I-I didn't mean all that.

37:33.917 --> 37:36.250
Brought an associate
to represent Sil.

37:37.583 --> 37:39.000
Got it.

37:39.083 --> 37:40.542
They're both in the lobby.

37:41.625 --> 37:42.792
Now?

37:45.959 --> 37:48.917
Pinstripe suits, red tie.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.333
Okay, got it.

37:50.417 --> 37:52.583
Um, just sit tight

37:52.667 --> 37:56.083
and let me see if I can get
somebody to go down and get you.

37:59.625 --> 38:02.375
- Somebody get me out of here!
- Any more comments, tough guy?

38:02.458 --> 38:03.417
'Cat got your tongue?'

38:10.917 --> 38:14.709
Umm, I'm gonna get a soda.
Want one?

38:14.792 --> 38:15.875
Yeah.

38:17.834 --> 38:19.208
Hey, Lance.

38:20.625 --> 38:22.750
- Let's take a walk.
- Okay.

38:27.125 --> 38:28.959
That guy is loco.

38:29.041 --> 38:31.375
Tell me about it.
It's that Latin temper.

38:31.458 --> 38:32.875
(Lance)
'Yeah, yeah.'

38:46.959 --> 38:48.834
So it looks like
he beat you to it.

38:48.917 --> 38:50.959
Uh, "Sil came
and picked me up.

38:51.041 --> 38:54.166
He told me he shot Mick
by the docks."

38:54.250 --> 38:56.166
That's, uh, Lance's signature,
right?

38:59.625 --> 39:00.625
But that's a lie.

39:00.709 --> 39:02.250
Then what's the truth, Sil?

39:04.333 --> 39:05.959
Okay, Sil, get up.

39:06.041 --> 39:07.583
No. No.

39:07.667 --> 39:10.458
Well, I talked to the DA.
Your car, your gun.

39:10.542 --> 39:12.458
Take a jury 20 minutes
to convict you.

39:12.542 --> 39:13.917
It was Lance.

39:14.000 --> 39:17.417
Lance told me that Mick
had agreed to do the
stunt.

39:17.500 --> 39:19.458
But he didn't.

39:19.542 --> 39:22.041
Mick said if Lance wanted
him
to get back in the ring

39:22.125 --> 39:23.709
he could come tell him himself.

39:23.792 --> 39:25.083
You tell Lance that?

39:25.166 --> 39:26.458
I told him that..

39:28.875 --> 39:30.875
...Mick wanted to
be
with his kid.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.750
His son was in a coma.

39:36.709 --> 39:38.709
But Lance didn't care.

39:38.792 --> 39:41.250
And you went along
with whatever Lance
said.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.125
Well, we all did.

39:43.208 --> 39:44.375
Except for Mick.

39:47.834 --> 39:50.083
That's what pissed
Lance off the most.

39:52.208 --> 39:53.333
Next time I tell you
to do something

39:53.417 --> 39:54.834
you better damn well do it.

39:54.917 --> 39:56.458
I can't do anything
without you telling
me.

39:56.542 --> 39:58.875
And you know why?
'Cause that's how I want it.

40:03.208 --> 40:04.417
Now where's that gun?

40:25.917 --> 40:27.125
What the hell is your problem?

40:31.333 --> 40:33.542
I finally bring my kid
to a match

40:33.625 --> 40:35.291
and you throw me
through a table?

40:35.375 --> 40:37.166
Last I checked,
I make the
rules.

40:37.250 --> 40:38.500
Not for me.

40:38.583 --> 40:39.834
I'm done dancing
to your tune.

40:39.917 --> 40:41.125
Okay, okay, you're pissed

40:41.208 --> 40:42.500
that your kid saw you lose.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.458
Fine. Okay, bring
him
to the next one.

40:44.542 --> 40:45.834
It'll be the best
match
he's ever seen.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.333
You will be the champion
for the next two years.

40:47.417 --> 40:48.417
No, thanks.

40:48.500 --> 40:49.583
You leave when I ring the bell.

40:49.667 --> 40:50.750
You got that?

40:52.125 --> 40:54.291
We just got the TV deal, okay?

40:54.375 --> 40:55.875
Do you know how much money

40:55.959 --> 40:57.041
we are gonna make
on the next match?

40:57.125 --> 40:59.333
Clean the crap out of your ears.

40:59.417 --> 41:00.625
I'm done!

41:00.709 --> 41:03.208
Just-just can't handle it,
is that it?

41:03.291 --> 41:04.917
You'd rather be out
here
unloading cargo

41:05.000 --> 41:05.959
and busting thumbs?

41:06.041 --> 41:07.875
No more debt collecting.

41:07.959 --> 41:09.250
All aboveboard now.

41:09.333 --> 41:11.917
Oh, well, I'm sure
your kid's real
proud

41:12.000 --> 41:13.542
to have a punk
loser
for a dad.

41:16.291 --> 41:18.083
See what it feels like
every night in the ring.
