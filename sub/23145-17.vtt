00:02.290 --> 00:05.290
Kids!
Sack-lunch call!

00:05.290 --> 00:07.490
For mama's special
little superhero,

00:07.490 --> 00:10.690
a Batman PB&J.
Oh, boy!

00:10.700 --> 00:13.560
My bullies <i>love</i> Batman.
Thanks, Mom.

00:13.570 --> 00:16.230
For Hayley...
Mom, I work at a sub shop.

00:16.230 --> 00:18.570
I literally get paid
to eat sandwiches all day.

00:18.570 --> 00:21.300
But are any of your
sandwiches at work

00:21.310 --> 00:22.570
rocket ships?

00:22.570 --> 00:25.040
Whiz-bang!
Thanks, Mom.

00:25.040 --> 00:26.440
And for Roger...

00:26.440 --> 00:27.980
Chris Pine, Chris
Pine, Chris Pine.

00:27.980 --> 00:29.450
Chris Pine!

00:29.450 --> 00:32.119
Hooray!
Thanks, Mom!

00:32.119 --> 00:34.180
Do you have anything
for me, Mrs. S?

00:34.190 --> 00:36.720
Well, since it's just
you and me now,

00:36.720 --> 00:38.590
I guess you can have...

00:38.590 --> 00:39.860
this.

00:52.940 --> 00:55.270
Ah! Oh!

00:55.270 --> 00:58.810
Those were the plates we bought
at Epcot Center.

00:58.810 --> 01:01.010
Alright, Jeffy boy,

01:01.010 --> 01:03.350
time for old Francine
to have a...

01:03.350 --> 01:07.020
sack... lunch...
of her own.

01:07.020 --> 01:09.090
Mrs. S!

01:09.090 --> 01:12.160
What a crazy dream!

01:12.160 --> 01:14.790
No more hot sauce
right before bed for me.

01:17.100 --> 01:21.430

<i>teensy,</i> little taste.

Oh, nothing.

Just got the giggles?
Okay.

02:11.220 --> 02:13.750
Well, here's the silly thing.

02:13.750 --> 02:16.820
Last night,
I had the <i>silliest</i> dream.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.960
And in this dream...

02:21.630 --> 02:26.200
had sex with Jeff!

02:35.110 --> 02:37.840
You... and Jeff,

02:37.840 --> 02:40.380
with his floppy,
little ding-dong?

02:42.780 --> 02:45.780
I mean, can you imagine?!

02:45.780 --> 02:48.050
Look at me.

02:48.050 --> 02:50.990
I'm Francine and Jeff.

02:57.600 --> 03:00.530
Ahh!
Francine, can I rap at you

03:00.530 --> 03:02.600
in the living room real quick?

03:02.600 --> 03:05.200
So funny, that thing
about the dream.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.540
Love it.
Just hilarious.

03:06.540 --> 03:08.270
On a totally unrelated note,

03:08.270 --> 03:11.070
I just wanted to ask you
to do me one tiny, little favor

03:11.080 --> 03:13.810
and simply never sleep again.
Deal? Great.

03:13.810 --> 03:15.950
And, by the way,
I think Steve bent a fork.

03:15.950 --> 03:17.350
Oh, Stan.

03:17.350 --> 03:19.080
It was just a dumb dream.

03:19.080 --> 03:20.680
It doesn't mean anything.

03:20.690 --> 03:24.020
Now, are you gonna be able
to be an adult about this?

03:24.020 --> 03:28.630

03:28.630 --> 03:29.690

you have been such a help

these last few days.
Stan! Enough!

04:14.270 --> 04:16.870
We're going to deal
with this... now!

04:16.880 --> 04:18.680
Yikes. Time to go.

04:25.680 --> 04:28.320
Wow.
That was fast.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.090
Wait.
I thought Dr. Penguin died.

04:34.090 --> 04:35.760
Unfortunately, yes, he did.

04:35.760 --> 04:38.560
I'm Dr. Penguin's
twin brother... by marriage...

04:38.560 --> 04:40.100
Dr. Buttblast.

04:40.100 --> 04:43.030
Are you the Dr. Buttblast
from the hot sauce?!

04:43.030 --> 04:44.370
Oh, no.

04:44.370 --> 04:46.300
No, no.
I-I get that a lot.

04:46.310 --> 04:48.910
Although, I <i>am</i> trying to get
into the hot-sauce game.

04:48.910 --> 04:50.710
Tough racket, though.
Got to have a big,

04:50.710 --> 04:52.380
crazy name and label art.

04:52.380 --> 04:53.780
Can we get started, please?

04:53.780 --> 04:55.710
Alright, Stan, first question...

04:55.710 --> 04:58.250
How do you think you'd feel...

04:58.250 --> 04:59.850
about a hot sauce called

04:59.850 --> 05:03.190
Professor Fartmore's Habanero
Ass Hair Incinerator?

05:03.190 --> 05:06.460
What we came here to talk about
is Francine cheating on me!

05:06.460 --> 05:08.790
It was just one
stupid dream, Stan.

05:08.790 --> 05:10.590
But people follow their dreams.

05:10.600 --> 05:12.260
I heard that somewhere.

05:12.260 --> 05:13.460
And if you follow yours,

05:13.470 --> 05:15.130
it means you'll end up
leaving me.

05:15.130 --> 05:17.870
Hmm. Mm-hmm.

05:17.870 --> 05:20.070
Mm-hmm.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.610
Stan, I can't control my dreams,

05:22.610 --> 05:25.480
but I promise I'm not
going to leave you.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.610
So will you promise me
that you'll let this go?

05:29.610 --> 05:31.080
Alright.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.480
I promise.

05:32.480 --> 05:33.750
Bingo!

05:38.490 --> 05:40.560
I'm bushed.

05:40.560 --> 05:42.290
I think I'm gonna turn in.

05:42.290 --> 05:43.830
Alright, hon.
Good night.

05:47.170 --> 05:50.230

be dreaming about now?

06:25.540 --> 06:28.540

06:28.540 --> 06:30.740
You look so hot as a cat.

06:30.740 --> 06:32.280
You, too, you little minx.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.080
Get over here.

06:35.550 --> 06:37.410
Roger!
What the hell is going on?

06:37.420 --> 06:39.020
The song was all true, Stan.

06:39.020 --> 06:42.350
Going inside people's dreams
is one of my alien powers.

06:42.350 --> 06:44.950
Matter of fact, we're in one
of your dreams right now.

06:44.960 --> 06:47.290
So, what are you saying?
Well, I figured

06:47.290 --> 06:50.630
maybe I could take you with me
into Francine's dreams

06:50.630 --> 06:53.160
so you can make sure she's
not doing the nasty.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.900
Then again, that would be
breaking your promise to her

06:55.900 --> 06:57.430
to let the whole thing go.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.700
Aah!

06:59.700 --> 07:00.970
Bedroom... now!

07:00.970 --> 07:02.840
We're getting
in them dreams, baby!

07:02.840 --> 07:04.440
It's finally happening.

07:04.440 --> 07:06.180
You're dragging me
to your bedroom.

07:06.180 --> 07:08.450
Keep calm, Roger.
Stay in the moment.

07:08.450 --> 07:09.980
Enjoy this.

07:13.490 --> 07:15.950
So, how do we...
Relax, Stan.

07:15.950 --> 07:18.020
It's super-easy,
totally painless.

07:18.020 --> 07:20.420
All I have to do is this.

07:20.430 --> 07:22.230
And like this.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.830
Alright, here we go.

07:25.830 --> 07:28.300
Welcome to Francine's
dreamscape.

07:28.300 --> 07:31.100
Have a look around.
There's all sorts of crazy stuff

07:31.100 --> 07:32.440
in this place.

07:32.440 --> 07:35.710
A pipe organ made of intestines?

07:35.710 --> 07:38.840
A little creepy,
but I'll allow it.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.180
Octopus with Steve's face?

07:41.180 --> 07:43.580
A little zany,
but I'll allow it.

07:43.580 --> 07:45.980
Wow!
Get a load of this fern.

07:45.980 --> 07:47.520
So lush.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.850
Only in the fantastic world
of dreams.

07:49.860 --> 07:52.460
Huh. Maybe I <i>don't</i> have
anything to worry about.

07:54.590 --> 07:57.190
My sex senses are tingling.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.460
Out of the way, geek.

07:59.460 --> 08:02.600
Oh...

08:02.600 --> 08:05.800
Oh, those weren't sex sounds.
It was a baby.

08:08.010 --> 08:11.140
Oh, Stan, my poor little baby.

08:13.340 --> 08:15.410
Is that how Francine sees me?

08:15.410 --> 08:17.680
As a whiny, little freak
of a baby?

08:17.680 --> 08:19.080
Looks like it.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.680
No wonder she's having sex
dreams about other people.

08:21.690 --> 08:23.620
She doesn't even see me
as a man.

08:23.620 --> 08:26.620
Well, maybe if you start acting
like more of a big, macho man

08:26.630 --> 08:28.090
around her, that'll change.

08:28.090 --> 08:29.960
Then again,
maybe the right thing to do

08:29.960 --> 08:31.690
is just let it go, like you...

08:31.700 --> 08:33.500
Stan big fan of big-man plan!

08:35.970 --> 08:38.440
Dear Lord,
please bless this food

08:38.440 --> 08:42.570
and all the gross employees
at Boston Market who made it.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.240
Amen.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.110
Is this what a baby would do?

08:50.120 --> 08:52.120
What?
Stan, what's going on?

08:52.120 --> 08:55.590
Are those stick-on
Garfield tattoos?

08:55.590 --> 08:57.390
Here, want me to cut your steak?

08:57.390 --> 08:59.720
I'm a grown man.
I can do it myself.

08:59.730 --> 09:02.130
Aah!
Oh, honey!

09:02.130 --> 09:03.330
I'll get a Band-Aid.

09:03.330 --> 09:06.730
No!
I don't need any help.

09:06.730 --> 09:08.530
Blacking... out.

09:08.530 --> 09:11.200
Not much... time.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.400
Does a baby have this?

09:23.820 --> 09:25.750
What if we did, like,
a giant devil

09:25.750 --> 09:28.950
pissing hot sauce right
into King Kong's mouth?

09:28.950 --> 09:30.550
I'm not making a hot sauce...

09:30.560 --> 09:31.960
for soccer moms, Klaus!

09:31.960 --> 09:34.420
I said "bold"!

09:34.430 --> 09:37.160
Pft, so, I was just thinking
about how much I killed it

09:37.160 --> 09:39.160
with all that macho stuff
at dinner.

09:39.160 --> 09:42.370
So, pretty much, I'm not worried
about Francine at all anymore,

09:42.370 --> 09:44.970
but, hey, maybe let's go pop
into her dreams really quick

09:44.970 --> 09:47.240
just to make sure it worked?

09:56.720 --> 10:00.250
Oh, Stan.

10:00.250 --> 10:03.250
I've transformed from a baby
into a buffoon!

10:03.250 --> 10:04.390
Not exactly.

10:04.390 --> 10:07.060
Here, I'll let Stevetopus
explain.

10:07.060 --> 10:09.190
You see, Francine's subconscious

10:09.190 --> 10:11.530
has created <i>many</i> different
versions of you.

10:11.530 --> 10:14.930
Whichever one best fits her current
perception of you in real life

10:14.930 --> 10:18.200
is the one that's most powerful
and visible at any given moment,

10:18.200 --> 10:21.600
but the rest are always
down here somewhere.

10:21.610 --> 10:23.010
That's your anger.

10:25.210 --> 10:27.540
Your emotional unavailability.

10:27.550 --> 10:30.610
Your dorky side.

10:30.620 --> 10:33.150
Your lesbian-grandmother side.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.150
What's that one?

10:34.150 --> 10:36.350
Oh, another fern lover, I see.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.950
That's your insecurity...

10:37.960 --> 10:39.760
a real nasty dude.

10:39.760 --> 10:42.360
We call him Stanferatu.

10:44.500 --> 10:46.100
These guys all suck!

10:46.100 --> 10:48.430
Well, there are good ones,
too, you haven't seen yet.

10:48.430 --> 10:50.430
What does that matter
if she also sees me

10:50.440 --> 10:52.640
as this collection of goons?!

10:52.640 --> 10:53.970
There she is now.

10:53.970 --> 10:56.440
I'm gonna go give her
a piece of my mind.

10:56.440 --> 10:58.840
Are you crazy?!

10:58.840 --> 11:00.180
A human dream-stormer

11:00.180 --> 11:02.450
can never let a host become
aware of his presence.

11:02.450 --> 11:04.980
I call it dream-storming,
by the way. Pretty cool, right?

11:04.980 --> 11:07.780
Don't you know the most basic
rules of dream-storming?!

11:07.790 --> 11:09.050
No. Why would I?

11:09.050 --> 11:12.060
You've been going
inside my dreams?!

11:12.060 --> 11:14.260
Oh, don't try
to turn this around on me.

11:14.260 --> 11:16.730
You're the one who's been letting
that subconscious of yours

11:16.730 --> 11:18.930
run wild,
thinking me up as some kind of

11:18.930 --> 11:20.600
bunch of Garbage Pail Kids.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.000
I can't believe
you're so insecure

11:23.000 --> 11:26.600
that you're actually
<i>invading</i> my dreams!

11:26.610 --> 11:29.610
How dare you?!

11:29.610 --> 11:31.340
She's right.

11:31.340 --> 11:34.340
I'm going to do the right thing
and leave well enough alone.

11:34.350 --> 11:35.880
I mean it this time.

11:35.880 --> 11:38.350
"And Stan stayed
true to his word

11:38.350 --> 11:42.690
and never meddled in Francine's
dreams again."

11:42.690 --> 11:44.620
And as for Francine,

11:44.620 --> 11:46.290
well, she left Stan

11:46.290 --> 11:49.760
and started having sex
with Jeff for reals.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.430
All the different kinds
of sex...

11:52.430 --> 11:54.700
oral, anal, hand stuff,

11:54.700 --> 11:57.030
whatever you call it when you
push the genitals together

11:57.040 --> 11:59.300
and just mash them around.

11:59.300 --> 12:00.900
And why?

12:00.910 --> 12:02.710
Because she knows

12:02.710 --> 12:04.310
you're <i>pathetic...</i>

12:04.310 --> 12:08.650
little worm of a man, Stan.

12:10.180 --> 12:12.720
Just one more time, Roger.
I have an idea.

12:12.720 --> 12:13.920
Okay.

12:13.920 --> 12:16.120
Here we go.
Wait.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.920
What are you doing?
Same as usual.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.720
I just have to touch you both
at the same time.

12:19.720 --> 12:22.590
Then why were you sticking your
fingers in our eyes before?

12:22.590 --> 12:25.260
That's a way of touching.

12:25.260 --> 12:27.800
Since trying to change
how Francine saw me

12:27.800 --> 12:29.400
in the real world didn't work,

12:29.400 --> 12:31.600
I figured I'd do it right here
at the source...

12:31.600 --> 12:32.940
her subconscious...

12:32.940 --> 12:36.470
by making these creeps
look cool and sexy.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.810
There she is.

12:38.810 --> 12:40.810
Showtime!

12:40.810 --> 12:42.810
♪ Yeah ♪

12:42.810 --> 12:44.550
♪ Oh, yeah ♪

12:44.550 --> 12:49.950

12:49.960 --> 12:52.290

13:04.970 --> 13:07.100
Damn it!
You're such idiots.

13:07.110 --> 13:08.770
Stan!

13:10.240 --> 13:12.240
You're in my dreams again.

13:12.240 --> 13:14.640
Oh, no.
You let the host see you.

13:14.650 --> 13:17.650
It's a dreamquake!

13:17.650 --> 13:20.650
Get back over here and do it
like I showed you.

13:25.790 --> 13:26.990
You killed him.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.460
They can be killed?

13:28.460 --> 13:30.590
Good.
Give me that sword, geek.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.660
Now Francine won't see me
as an ogre anymore.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.200
Or a dork!
or a... a...

13:37.200 --> 13:38.600
I don't... I don't know.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.000
Slenderman?

13:40.010 --> 13:42.670
Stop it, Stan!

13:42.670 --> 13:46.340
Your insecurity is making
Stanferatu stronger.

13:46.350 --> 13:48.080
With the dream disintegrating,

13:48.080 --> 13:50.880
he could use me as a portal
to the real world!

13:50.880 --> 13:52.750
- What?!
- Come on, Stan.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.150
This is dream-storming 101.

13:55.150 --> 13:56.350
Oh, God.
It's too late.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.560
He's going in my eye, Stan!

13:58.560 --> 14:00.220
It sucks!

14:09.700 --> 14:11.430
I had a nightmare

14:11.440 --> 14:15.040
and I was gonna ask to sleep
with you guys, but...

14:15.040 --> 14:17.840
clearly, you're dealing
with something else.

14:22.250 --> 14:24.580
That's better.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.250
What happened?
Where's Francine?

14:27.250 --> 14:30.390
Did that monster, Stanferatu, take her?
I don't think so, Stan,

14:30.390 --> 14:33.660
'cause he's right there
behind the dresser.

14:33.660 --> 14:35.930
What have you done with
Francine, you ghoul?

14:35.930 --> 14:38.130
I did not take her.

14:38.130 --> 14:40.400
She was lost in the dreamquake,

14:40.400 --> 14:42.130
her soul and body both.

14:42.130 --> 14:45.540
Now she's adrift
in the ethereal domain.

14:45.540 --> 14:48.000
The what?
The collective dream realm

14:48.010 --> 14:52.140
that connects all dreams
and all dreamers.

14:52.140 --> 14:54.410
This is real basic stuff.

14:54.410 --> 14:56.680
I don't really think
he <i>wants</i> to learn.

14:56.680 --> 14:58.550
She's a dream nomad now,

14:58.550 --> 15:01.480
who must roam
from dream to dream.

15:01.490 --> 15:05.360
To find her,
we must find her host.

15:05.360 --> 15:08.020
Stan, have you considered
that maybe Francine

15:08.030 --> 15:10.030
went to this place on purpose

15:10.030 --> 15:11.760
to get away from you?

15:13.030 --> 15:14.760
He's against us.

15:14.770 --> 15:17.970
<i>We</i> will find Francine
and reclaim her.

15:17.970 --> 15:19.500
She is ours!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.900
You know, this guy's kind of
speaking my language here.

15:21.910 --> 15:23.110
So it's settled.

15:23.110 --> 15:25.580
Stan and Stanferatu on the case.

15:25.580 --> 15:27.780
Put her there, partner.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.250
Damn!
I am loving your long fingers.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.250
You're probably a pretty fast
typer, huh?

15:32.250 --> 15:33.980
I would love to get you
behind the keyboard

15:33.990 --> 15:36.220
and watch you fire off
a few paragraphs.

15:39.060 --> 15:42.130
Uh, Dad, what's the deal
with this guy again?

15:42.130 --> 15:44.130
Yeah, he keeps stealing our peas

15:44.130 --> 15:46.000
and accusing us of parsimony.

15:47.200 --> 15:49.330
<i>My</i> peas.

15:49.330 --> 15:51.000
Stanferatu gets a bad rap,

15:51.000 --> 15:52.940
but he's a great guy
once you get to know him.

15:52.940 --> 15:54.810
And he's <i>always</i> got my back.

15:54.810 --> 15:57.740
The boy seeks to outlive you.

15:57.740 --> 15:59.740
Is this true, Steve?

15:59.740 --> 16:02.280
With the natural order of things
being what it is...

16:02.280 --> 16:05.220
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention, Stanferatu.

16:05.220 --> 16:06.620
Look, the most important thing

16:06.620 --> 16:08.820
is Stanferatu is helping me
find your mother.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.220
He called in to Rush Limbaugh
and really talked it up.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.290
Bingo!
We got a lead.

16:14.290 --> 16:16.430
E-mail from some yokel
downstate.

16:16.430 --> 16:18.090
Apparently,
some people around there

16:18.100 --> 16:20.230
have been dreaming
about Francine.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.570
It's a good thing you got
Stanferatu to help you now,

16:22.570 --> 16:24.770
because I've got a big pitch
at Frank's RedHot.

16:24.770 --> 16:27.700
Klaus is actually just about
to show me the final artwork.

16:27.710 --> 16:29.110
I give you...

16:29.110 --> 16:31.510
your hot-sauce label.

16:31.510 --> 16:33.380
It's perfect.

16:33.380 --> 16:35.250
Just like the Mona Lisa's eyes,

16:35.250 --> 16:38.520
the donkey's prolapsed anus
follows you wherever you go.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.050
Yep. Mm-hmm.

16:43.060 --> 16:45.260
I saw'n that lady
in my dreams, alright.

16:45.260 --> 16:47.660
Did you [bleep] her?!
No, sir.

16:47.660 --> 16:49.260
Jesus, Stanferatu.

16:49.260 --> 16:51.730
Sir, we need to go
inside your dreams.

16:51.730 --> 16:53.400
Won't do you no good.

16:53.400 --> 16:55.730
Stopped dreaming about her
a couple days ago.

16:55.730 --> 16:58.670
I mean, a dream nomad
can only dwell in the etherium

16:58.670 --> 17:01.200
of any given host for 48 hours.

17:01.210 --> 17:02.670
How do you know this?!

17:02.670 --> 17:04.210
Oh, I see.

17:04.210 --> 17:05.880
Us country <i>bumpkins</i>

17:05.880 --> 17:10.079
are too <i>stupid</i> to know
about the ethereal domain.

17:10.079 --> 17:11.550
Is that right?

17:14.950 --> 17:18.420
Every possible host we've talked
too, we've been too late.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.359
I'm starting to lose hope
we'll ever get to one

17:20.359 --> 17:21.819
while Francine's still there.

17:21.829 --> 17:25.430
You're not thinking of ditching
me, are you, Stan?

17:25.430 --> 17:27.630
What? No.
You're my day-one homey.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.830
You know that.
Stanferatu,

17:29.830 --> 17:32.440
have you been trying
to get into my phone?

17:32.440 --> 17:33.570
Look at this.
I'm locked out,

17:33.570 --> 17:35.310
and it's covered
in chicken grease.

17:39.110 --> 17:40.310
I know you're not really
sleeping.

17:40.310 --> 17:42.450
Are we friends, Stan?

17:42.450 --> 17:43.780
Yes. I told you.

17:43.780 --> 17:45.320
Are we best friends?

17:45.320 --> 17:47.250
I mean, sure, yeah.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.250
I... I-I-I got to go
to the bathroom.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.720
What are you doing in there?

17:54.730 --> 17:57.730
I'm just trying to
take a shit, man! Come on!

17:57.730 --> 18:00.000
I need to know you're not
going to leave me!

18:00.000 --> 18:02.670
Let me in!
Oh, my God.

18:02.670 --> 18:05.200
Is this what I've been doing
to Francine?

18:05.200 --> 18:07.340
Suffocating her
with my own insecurity?

18:12.010 --> 18:14.610
Aah!

18:14.610 --> 18:15.750
Lies!

18:15.750 --> 18:17.710
All lies!

18:21.290 --> 18:22.950
Dad!
Did you find mom?

18:22.960 --> 18:24.350
No, Son.

18:24.360 --> 18:26.290
I'm afraid she might be
gone for good.

18:26.290 --> 18:28.420
You'll probably have to go live
with Tuttle.

18:28.430 --> 18:31.160
Oh...
I miss mom so much.

18:31.160 --> 18:33.830
Last night, I dreamt of two of her.
Say that again!

18:33.830 --> 18:35.900
Last night, I dreamt... Shut up!
There's no time.

18:35.900 --> 18:37.730
Get in the car.
I'll ether you on the way.

18:41.040 --> 18:43.040
Mr. Buttblast...
Doctor.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.370
We...

18:44.380 --> 18:46.040
<i>love</i> your hot sauce.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.380
And just as long as nothing
<i>weird</i> happens

18:48.380 --> 18:49.910
in the next few minutes,

18:49.910 --> 18:51.510
I'd say we have a deal.

18:51.520 --> 18:52.920
Roger,

18:52.920 --> 18:54.790
we need to go inside the boy.

19:05.400 --> 19:07.200
Francine!

19:07.200 --> 19:09.000
Stan, I should have known,

19:09.000 --> 19:12.540
sooner or later, you'd find me
and drag me back home.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.810
So let's just get it
over with and go...

19:15.810 --> 19:18.740
No. I didn't come
to take you home.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.480
Spending time with Stanferatu
made me understand

19:21.480 --> 19:23.550
how awful it feels
when someone you love

19:23.550 --> 19:26.620
won't trust you enough to just
give you some space.

19:26.620 --> 19:28.890
So I only came to tell you...

19:28.890 --> 19:30.290
I'm sorry.

19:30.290 --> 19:33.960
And if you ever decide
you've had enough space,

19:33.960 --> 19:35.390
I'll be waiting for you.

19:38.300 --> 19:39.600
Stan?

19:41.630 --> 19:42.700
Thank you.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.840
I knew you would betray me,
Stan!

19:45.840 --> 19:47.500
So I will <i>kill</i> you

19:47.510 --> 19:50.240
and claim Francine for my own!

19:56.180 --> 19:57.380
Stan!

19:57.380 --> 19:59.120
Stanferatu's too strong for you

19:59.120 --> 20:00.580
in the dream realm!

20:00.590 --> 20:03.720
Wait. His power comes from
my insecurity.

20:03.720 --> 20:07.720
Steve, dream us up Jeff.

20:07.730 --> 20:08.790
Hiya.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.730
If I can be confident enough

20:10.730 --> 20:13.930
to stand by while Jeff really
works you over...

20:13.930 --> 20:16.200
that should weaken
Stanferatu enough

20:16.200 --> 20:17.330
for me to defeat him.

20:17.340 --> 20:19.270
I'm not gonna have sex

20:19.270 --> 20:21.070
with Jeff!

20:21.070 --> 20:23.410
Fine.

20:23.410 --> 20:25.810
Then <i>I'll</i> have sex with Jeff.

20:25.810 --> 20:28.210
What?!
How the hell would that...

20:32.950 --> 20:35.820
Well, I guess it is a good
distraction.

20:35.820 --> 20:37.350
Dream sword!

20:41.360 --> 20:42.430
Aah!

20:42.430 --> 20:43.890
Aah!

20:43.900 --> 20:45.360
What a crazy dream.

20:45.360 --> 20:48.570
No more Colonel Buttchug's
Irradiated Sphincter Scorcher

20:48.570 --> 20:50.700
right before bed for me.

20:50.700 --> 20:53.740
Well, maybe just one more
<i>teensy,</i> little taste.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.780
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
