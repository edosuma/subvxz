00:53.085 --> 00:56.086
Some fish aren't meant to be caged

00:57.097 --> 00:59.091
because they belong to the sky.

01:02.089 --> 01:13.021
In the Northern Ocean there is a fish that goes by the name of Kun.
Its size is too large to measure.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.068
Who we are,

01:25.036 --> 01:27.016
where we come from,

01:27.056 --> 01:29.047
and where we are going.

01:34.025 --> 01:36.076
Nobody cares about these questions.

01:37.067 --> 01:40.041
Every day, people just go to work,

01:40.090 --> 01:43.009
smile at each other,

01:43.064 --> 01:44.090
bicker,

01:44.090 --> 01:45.092
buy things,

01:47.020 --> 01:48.015
and sleep.

01:52.004 --> 01:54.017
One hundred years have passed.

01:54.093 --> 01:58.061
I am already 117 years old.

01:59.094 --> 02:03.001
Many times I have told them

02:03.051 --> 02:06.005
that each living human being

02:06.031 --> 02:10.073
is a giant fish in the sea,

02:11.026 --> 02:16.012
and that human life is just like swimming across the sea.

02:20.049 --> 02:22.048
But they never listened to me,

02:22.073 --> 02:24.077
saying that I've gone senile.

02:26.067 --> 02:28.080
However, every time I dream,

02:29.005 --> 02:33.083
I can see very clearly many big fish falling from the sky

02:34.037 --> 02:36.097
and hear them calling to each other.

02:38.030 --> 02:42.096
Their beautiful voices remind me of my past.

02:51.073 --> 02:54.013
4.5 billion years ago,

02:54.030 --> 02:58.070
on this planet, there was nothing but water

02:59.012 --> 03:01.023
and some big old fish

03:02.050 --> 03:05.063
that were the souls of human beings.

03:06.066 --> 03:09.047
In fact, since their birth,

03:10.007 --> 03:12.023
they have never forgotten their origins.

03:17.052 --> 03:18.083
My name is Chun.

03:19.016 --> 03:21.026
I come from the undersea world.

03:21.077 --> 03:23.037
The sky of my abode

03:23.069 --> 03:26.017
is connected to the sea of the human world.

03:27.077 --> 03:31.028
Human souls wander in their world for a long time

03:31.098 --> 03:35.086
before they reach the end of the sea and the sky of this world.

03:37.041 --> 03:39.065
We are guardians of human souls

03:40.040 --> 03:43.073
and the laws of nature in the world.

03:44.094 --> 03:47.099
We are neither human beings nor gods,

03:48.059 --> 03:51.007
but the Others.

04:26.043 --> 04:28.044
What a beautiful starry night!

04:30.088 --> 04:32.015
The rite of passage is about to start.

04:32.028 --> 04:33.003
Hurry up.

04:33.092 --> 04:34.093
Thank you, Brother Songzi.

04:35.084 --> 04:37.090
Sister Leizu!

04:38.018 --> 04:39.025
We are attending the rite of passage.

04:39.053 --> 04:40.047
Can we borrow two horses?

04:41.003 --> 04:42.046
Of course.

04:47.060 --> 04:48.035
How awesome,

04:48.066 --> 04:49.046
you're taller than me.

04:49.074 --> 04:50.006
Chun,

04:56.093 --> 04:57.063
Wait for me!

04:58.070 --> 04:59.049
Faster!

05:03.011 --> 05:04.042
is the human world fun?

05:05.084 --> 05:07.021
last year I almost decided to stay there.

05:07.051 --> 05:08.074
Then you should've!

05:11.042 --> 05:12.073
If I did, who would see you off this year?

05:13.037 --> 05:14.026
You don't need to.

05:14.029 --> 05:15.043
I didn't ask you to follow me.

05:30.071 --> 05:31.056
It's starting.

05:31.083 --> 05:32.058
Hurry, hurry!

05:40.078 --> 05:42.072
take care of yourself in the human world.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.049
Don't worry, grandma.

05:46.029 --> 05:47.023
Get over here!

05:48.040 --> 05:49.047
Sure. Coming!

05:58.059 --> 06:00.063
Grandma, good luck!

06:11.027 --> 06:12.035
you will be by yourself.

06:13.037 --> 06:15.010
Here. Have some more.

06:15.090 --> 06:17.021
Ma, I'm full now.

06:19.022 --> 06:20.082
when will you come back?

06:23.020 --> 06:24.024
I'll be back in seven days.

06:24.024 --> 06:27.065
Watching over all living souls is the bright heaven.

06:27.088 --> 06:31.037
Heed my prayer, and bestow blessings upon thee!

06:31.077 --> 06:34.034
You shall explore the human world for seven days.

06:34.062 --> 06:37.024
to observe the laws of nature that are under our control.

06:37.052 --> 06:41.004
But you must avoid all contact with humans.

06:41.031 --> 06:44.011
That is the absolute rule of the heavens.

06:44.011 --> 06:45.033
The Gate of Sea and Sky,

06:45.033 --> 06:46.054
open!

07:23.017 --> 07:24.025
By the time you return safely,

07:24.045 --> 07:25.063
you will be an adult

07:26.008 --> 07:27.030
You must be cautious of the humans.

07:27.053 --> 07:28.019
I know.

07:29.036 --> 07:30.019
(Relax.) stay far away from them.

07:30.019 --> 07:31.000
Chun is smart.

07:31.084 --> 07:32.046
Nonsense.

07:32.059 --> 07:34.039
Jin's daughter didn't return last year.

07:35.074 --> 07:36.091
What are you waiting for?

07:37.012 --> 07:38.078
Now is the time!

07:45.081 --> 07:48.052
Remember, only the maelstrom links the two worlds.

07:48.061 --> 07:49.076
You must get back to it by the seventh day,

07:49.083 --> 07:50.047
Ma, I already know that.

07:50.047 --> 07:52.018
or you won't return. I know.

07:52.089 --> 07:54.013
Soup's here! Soup's here!

08:17.099 --> 08:19.044
My daughter is an adult now.

08:25.063 --> 08:26.069
take care of yourself!

08:28.014 --> 08:29.059
We will wait for your safe return.

08:30.040 --> 08:32.008
Leave us. Just go.

08:32.035 --> 08:33.020
Don't worry.

08:50.055 --> 08:51.022
Chun!

08:51.045 --> 08:52.016
Come here.

08:55.076 --> 08:56.041
Remember,

08:56.065 --> 08:58.017
it's dangerous out there.

08:58.017 --> 09:00.004
Don't let the humans come close to you.

09:12.090 --> 09:13.054
Chun,

09:14.034 --> 09:15.083
have a safe journey!

09:16.064 --> 09:18.059
I'll be waiting for you!

09:28.076 --> 09:31.021
Every child that reaches the age of 16

09:31.094 --> 09:35.087
is sent to the human world for their rite of passage

09:36.081 --> 09:38.008
to get a closer look

09:38.036 --> 09:42.028
at the functioning of the laws of nature.

09:43.059 --> 09:46.097
That was the first time that we saw the sceneries of the human world,

09:47.071 --> 09:49.086
which were completely unlike what we had been told.

09:50.099 --> 09:53.042
We had never been happier.

09:54.073 --> 09:56.065
The human world was a spectacular place.

09:59.003 --> 10:00.025
Brother, look!

10:00.045 --> 10:02.041
The red dolphins have come back

10:02.068 --> 10:04.014
like every year!

10:04.051 --> 10:06.001
Here, let's give our greetings.

10:06.057 --> 10:08.073
Hello!

10:10.050 --> 10:13.072
YOU ALL COME AGAIN!

10:26.074 --> 10:29.031
Travelling in the human world alone,

10:30.001 --> 10:32.004
I came across giant ships,

10:32.073 --> 10:35.023
I saw lights that look like stars,

10:36.099 --> 10:41.020
many paper boats with burning candles

10:41.076 --> 10:43.059
that carried

10:44.006 --> 10:49.082
the souls of the deceased on rivers to the great sea.

10:51.018 --> 10:52.020
On the sixth day,

10:53.015 --> 10:55.005
together with the floating lanterns,

10:55.092 --> 11:00.025
I returned to the sea along a waterfall.

11:17.066 --> 11:18.061
Watch closely!

11:26.059 --> 11:27.005
Is it fun?

11:27.033 --> 11:28.002
Yeah!

11:28.005 --> 11:29.029
I'll show you something even more fun.

11:35.017 --> 11:36.038
What are you doing, big brother?

11:39.054 --> 11:40.029
Here, help me.

11:40.057 --> 11:41.085
Smear it on my back.

11:45.053 --> 11:46.014
Naughty girl.

11:47.036 --> 11:48.010
Stay right here.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.081
So many fish!

13:11.006 --> 13:13.051
What took you so long, big brother?

13:13.087 --> 13:15.013
I was chasing a red dolphin.

13:15.066 --> 13:16.073
Look, it's here.

13:17.089 --> 13:19.089
Wow. It's been following us.

13:20.075 --> 13:22.000
It is different from the other dolphins.

13:22.086 --> 13:23.055
Much smarter.

13:23.083 --> 13:25.061
I think it likes you.

14:52.069 --> 14:53.040
Where's it from?

14:53.048 --> 14:55.012
Near the maelstrom.

14:55.059 --> 14:56.052
A dolphin.

14:56.090 --> 14:58.035
It's the red one.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.004
It's trapped.

15:00.050 --> 15:01.072
Bring me the dagger.

15:01.091 --> 15:02.065
I'll help it.

15:03.005 --> 15:04.006
But there's a maelstrom down there.

15:04.039 --> 15:05.070
Don't worry. I'll be careful.

15:07.072 --> 15:08.072
Now go.

15:19.092 --> 15:21.008
Brother, take care!

15:51.050 --> 15:52.038
Brother!

15:57.067 --> 15:58.050
I'm here to help you.

16:20.068 --> 16:23.005
Brother! Come back!

17:35.026 --> 17:37.040
Gimme my brother! Gimme my brother!

17:38.086 --> 17:41.048
Brother, come back!

17:41.085 --> 17:43.025
Brother!

18:02.060 --> 18:03.001
Chun!

18:03.099 --> 18:04.079
You've returned!

18:07.055 --> 18:08.044
Are you alright?

18:08.063 --> 18:09.025
I'm fine.

18:09.037 --> 18:10.055
No more questions. Let's go home.

18:11.034 --> 18:14.000
I'll make you delicious food for your return.

18:28.089 --> 18:29.073
Morning, grandma.

18:30.007 --> 18:31.009
Is grandpa awake?

18:45.045 --> 18:46.006
Grandpa,

18:46.013 --> 18:47.097
where do humans go when they die?

18:50.013 --> 18:52.038
Their body will turn into dirt.

18:52.080 --> 18:53.089
What about their soul?

18:54.087 --> 18:58.022
Their soul will swim to the northernmost House of Rusheng

18:58.067 --> 19:00.014
where it is transformed into small fish

19:00.042 --> 19:02.003
and watched over by the Soul Keeper.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.000
Will we die, too?

19:04.007 --> 19:05.055
Of course.

19:07.032 --> 19:09.009
Where there's life, there's death.

19:10.007 --> 19:12.084
My own destiny is drawing near, too.

19:14.009 --> 19:16.027
Grandpa, I don't want you to die.

19:17.005 --> 19:20.047
How lovely. But it is the law of nature.

19:20.073 --> 19:21.097
For us,

19:22.029 --> 19:24.029
death is nothing but the gate to eternity.

19:58.095 --> 20:01.071
What troubles you, little girl?

20:04.019 --> 20:07.070
I don't think the flute belongs to this world.

20:08.017 --> 20:09.043
It is not mine.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.026
Yet lovely.

20:11.068 --> 20:13.064
Who is its owner?

20:14.015 --> 20:16.049
A boy from the human world,

20:17.001 --> 20:18.039
but is already dead now.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.054
I killed him.

20:19.087 --> 20:21.074
A human boy.

20:22.072 --> 20:24.088
If we are talking about deceased human beings,

20:25.056 --> 20:27.087
perhaps I can help you.

20:31.057 --> 20:32.097
Today at midnight,

20:33.072 --> 20:35.050
bring the bell back here.

20:36.030 --> 20:39.048
Ring it, and somebody will pick you up.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.005
If you dare to come,

20:43.032 --> 20:45.051
I will be waiting for you.

23:15.005 --> 23:17.016
Sorry. Clumsy me.

23:19.026 --> 23:21.013
Where are you going so late?

25:32.052 --> 25:35.047
Some things can be foreseen in life.

25:36.036 --> 25:39.040
The moment I stepped on the boat,

25:40.038 --> 25:42.092
I knew that my fate would be greatly changed.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.053
Are you alone?

27:04.025 --> 27:05.023
Follow me.

27:23.006 --> 27:24.079
Thanks, but I rather stand.

27:38.075 --> 27:40.038
What's the date of his death?

27:42.029 --> 27:45.031
April the eighteenth.

27:46.018 --> 27:47.073
I hope your date is correct,

27:48.086 --> 27:53.002
because we get more dead people than the fleas on my cats every day.

27:53.044 --> 27:54.005
It is.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.041
That day was my birthday.

27:55.083 --> 27:57.028
The heavens have their own rules,

27:57.051 --> 27:59.057
which you are now publicly violating.

28:01.036 --> 28:02.025
I must revive him.

28:02.052 --> 28:03.028
You don't care?

28:03.051 --> 28:06.013
Disobeying the heavens will incur the harshest of punishments,

28:06.041 --> 28:07.023
no matter who you are.

28:07.051 --> 28:08.068
I owe him my life,

28:08.075 --> 28:10.007
and I must pay him back.

28:10.015 --> 28:11.060
Who do you think you are?

28:12.025 --> 28:14.028
I've been plodding in this place for 800 years,

28:14.037 --> 28:16.048
and yet it is still not enough to pay back what I owe.

28:16.081 --> 28:17.073
Quiet!

28:18.080 --> 28:20.059
I'll tell you what the most pathetic thing in the world is.

28:21.007 --> 28:23.017
You meet someone, you make a mistake,

28:23.020 --> 28:24.086
you wish you can make up for it, pay them back,

28:25.013 --> 28:28.018
only to find out in the end that there is nothing you can do.

28:28.035 --> 28:31.008
Sins of the past have no remedy.

28:32.089 --> 28:36.060
We will never be able to pay for what we have done.

28:36.064 --> 28:37.044
But you said you could help.

28:37.055 --> 28:38.075
I felt sorry for you.

28:39.031 --> 28:41.014
To bring a dead man back to life,

28:41.015 --> 28:43.030
do you know what the price is?

28:43.089 --> 28:44.060
What is it?

28:45.001 --> 28:47.073
In exchange for his life, you must give me the most beautiful part of your body.

28:49.066 --> 28:50.049
eyes.

28:55.010 --> 28:56.009
Scared?

28:57.049 --> 29:00.053
You would never give away your precious little eyes.

29:01.037 --> 29:04.042
Alright. You can give me half of your life instead.

29:04.093 --> 29:06.015
If that's what it takes,

29:15.074 --> 29:17.032
Aya. You pooped here again!

29:17.032 --> 29:18.091
My dearest darling.

29:22.014 --> 29:23.041
Why do you keep so many cats?

29:24.034 --> 29:26.066
Because they are the only living things here

29:26.082 --> 29:29.068
that an old thing like me can keep.

29:33.085 --> 29:36.066
Every living human being

29:37.027 --> 29:41.030
is a giant fish in the sea.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.025
When they are born,

29:46.082 --> 29:49.086
their journey in the sea starts.

29:51.045 --> 29:56.004
Human life is just like swimming across the sea.

29:57.016 --> 29:59.041
Sometimes they meet,

29:59.097 --> 30:02.050
and sometimes they depart.

30:06.098 --> 30:08.072
When they die,

30:09.056 --> 30:11.062
they arrive at the shore,

30:12.089 --> 30:15.097
and head for their respective worlds.

30:20.051 --> 30:22.085
This is the Chamber of Heaven.

30:23.065 --> 30:28.023
The souls of the dead are all kept here.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.031
Countless souls are kept here.

30:32.040 --> 30:33.080
Can you find him?

30:35.001 --> 30:36.023
I remember his face.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.011
I remembered his face,

30:43.053 --> 30:45.003
but I didn't know his name.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.000
I could recall his eyes,

30:49.052 --> 30:51.058
and the scar on his forehead.

30:53.041 --> 30:56.003
I searched for six hours,

30:56.040 --> 30:58.088
the entire night.

31:19.005 --> 31:21.020
I will give his soul to you,

31:21.091 --> 31:25.046
and transfuse your soul into his to revive him.

31:26.002 --> 31:28.083
Henceforth, your lives will be directly linked.

31:29.035 --> 31:31.074
You have to protect him

31:32.001 --> 31:33.084
through all kinds of suffering

31:34.009 --> 31:38.029
until he grows into a big fish and returns to the human world.

31:38.085 --> 31:40.087
That's the process of resurrection.

31:41.056 --> 31:44.061
Once it begins, there's no way to turn back.

31:44.093 --> 31:48.063
Otherwise his soul will be dispersed for eternity.

31:48.091 --> 31:50.045
Are we clear?

31:57.072 --> 31:59.078
Still oversleeping.

32:00.016 --> 32:01.070
What did he do last night?

32:11.080 --> 32:12.074
Do you remember me?

32:13.044 --> 32:15.035
I was the red dolphin at the shore.

32:17.046 --> 32:19.001
Do you still recall your name?

32:20.027 --> 32:21.039
How about I pick one for you?

32:22.038 --> 32:23.088
My mom named me after "Chun",

32:24.039 --> 32:25.079
in hope that I can inherit her job in the future,

32:25.087 --> 32:27.015
mastering the growth of begonias

32:29.033 --> 32:31.002
I wish you...

32:32.012 --> 32:33.015
I wish you will grow up,

32:33.061 --> 32:35.002
to be larger than this glass jar,

32:35.048 --> 32:39.074
this mirror, this desk and this bed,

32:40.004 --> 32:41.061
until you feel this room is too small for you,

32:42.022 --> 32:44.010
and this castle is just a cage.

32:44.080 --> 32:46.076
What's all the noise about?

32:50.013 --> 32:52.015
You should be named after the most enormous fish in history.

32:59.092 --> 33:01.010
You can't raise a fish in your room.

33:01.027 --> 33:02.077
None of your business. Why are you here?

33:05.040 --> 33:06.079
I will keep this a secret.

33:08.006 --> 33:09.004
Why so angry?

33:13.098 --> 33:15.025
I just thought of a great name.

33:15.070 --> 33:16.021
What is it?

33:20.066 --> 33:22.064
In the Northern Ocean there is a fish that goes by the name of Kun.

33:22.091 --> 33:25.003
Kun's size is too large to measure.

33:25.053 --> 33:27.082
When Kun takes flight, its wings block the sky like clouds.

33:28.029 --> 33:29.032
All quoted from an ancient book.

33:31.001 --> 33:32.069
It says that there's this fish named Kun.

33:32.097 --> 33:33.072
It is so large

33:33.098 --> 33:35.063
that it can cover the sky. And it can also fly

33:36.016 --> 33:37.056
with wings the size of clouds.

33:39.081 --> 33:40.062
See you.

33:43.085 --> 33:44.093
From today on,

33:45.060 --> 33:46.091
You will be called

33:48.009 --> 33:49.010
Kun.

34:04.040 --> 34:05.044
Kun.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.060
It's strange to see such a fierce storm in this season.

34:30.070 --> 34:31.072
The rain is turning salty.

34:38.092 --> 34:39.085
You are getting bigger.

34:50.061 --> 34:52.030
Kun, do you want to play with me?

34:53.042 --> 34:54.007
Remember?

34:54.007 --> 34:55.002
in the sea,

34:55.002 --> 34:56.085
there was a red dolphin playing with you in the same way.

35:10.023 --> 35:11.054
You do remember me!

35:12.050 --> 35:13.058
Come here. Let's go.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.075
You can fly?

35:30.042 --> 35:31.082
You can fly in the rain!

35:32.038 --> 35:33.028
How amazing!

36:05.070 --> 36:07.001
They are calling you.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.016
Your family is expecting you home.

36:11.067 --> 36:13.039
Kun, please grow up quickly.

36:13.089 --> 36:15.015
Then I will send you back.

36:15.095 --> 36:16.051
I will.

36:40.081 --> 36:41.042
Kun?

36:43.070 --> 36:45.020
Ma, were you in my room?

36:46.019 --> 36:47.021
I did. And what of it?

36:47.049 --> 36:48.025
Where did you hide him?

36:50.040 --> 36:51.089
You haven't the faintest idea what you are doing.

36:53.053 --> 36:55.008
Mom, it is a fresh life!

36:55.055 --> 36:56.081
What? Come back here!

36:57.018 --> 36:58.003
Explain yourself!

36:58.077 --> 36:59.041
Stop following me.

36:59.041 --> 37:00.000
Why are you walking so fast?

37:01.064 --> 37:02.039
What happened?

37:03.061 --> 37:04.073
My mom threw Kun away.

37:06.013 --> 37:08.034
Don't worry. I know exactly where to find him.

37:16.004 --> 37:17.007
Here!

37:26.045 --> 37:28.032
Don't worry. We will find him.

37:30.042 --> 37:31.022
Kun?

37:33.056 --> 37:34.096
Get a rope. I will go down.

37:35.043 --> 37:36.046
What? You?

37:37.049 --> 37:39.009
I don't think so. It should be me.

37:40.016 --> 37:41.014
If you and Kun

37:41.024 --> 37:42.026
are both lost, it would be a disaster.

37:46.016 --> 37:48.050
This is definitely the stinkiest place in the world.

37:49.072 --> 37:50.051
Qiu,

37:51.031 --> 37:52.029
thank you.

37:58.071 --> 37:59.079
So many rats!

38:02.046 --> 38:04.000
What do we do? Kun will be eaten by them!

38:05.012 --> 38:06.034
Of course

38:07.015 --> 38:09.010
and only in a blink of an eye.

38:13.047 --> 38:15.058
What a fascinating smell. / It stinks like hell.

38:20.062 --> 38:22.096
It is the smell of love.

38:23.068 --> 38:26.068
Is there anything I can do for you, little handsome?

38:27.038 --> 38:28.097
I... I am looking for a fish.

38:29.049 --> 38:32.034
A fish? I think I've seen one.

38:32.071 --> 38:34.049
Really? Can you help me find him?

38:35.080 --> 38:38.014
That's no ordinary fish.

38:38.066 --> 38:41.096
It came from the Soul Keeper, didn't it?

38:42.012 --> 38:44.060
Good people turn into fish after death and belong to her.

38:44.088 --> 38:47.046
Bad people turn into mice after death and belong to me.

38:47.083 --> 38:51.062
My little mice are much lovelier than her fish.

38:52.042 --> 38:53.087
Can you really help me find Kun?

38:57.024 --> 38:58.083
Not unless...

38:59.011 --> 39:01.082
this handsome boy has a dance with me.

39:03.060 --> 39:04.096
Come here, be a good boy.

39:11.069 --> 39:12.062
Chun!

39:17.095 --> 39:21.009
Not only do boys need to learn how to dance,

39:23.000 --> 39:25.040
they also need to learn how to control their own mouse.

39:33.078 --> 39:35.099
The human world is a fantastic place.

39:36.074 --> 39:37.076
You've been there?

39:38.028 --> 39:39.073
There. Isn't it him?

39:47.026 --> 39:48.010
Are you alright?

39:49.051 --> 39:50.007
Kun.

39:50.087 --> 39:51.085
Are you all back?

39:56.014 --> 39:57.002
How is he?

40:03.063 --> 40:04.047
He woke up.

40:05.083 --> 40:07.070
What a pure soul.

40:08.031 --> 40:12.000
He will grow into a big fish in the future.

40:18.075 --> 40:19.078
Got ya!

40:24.069 --> 40:25.062
Where are you hiding?

40:27.027 --> 40:28.030
Where's everybody?

40:31.072 --> 40:33.001
Where are you this time?

40:49.013 --> 40:50.053
Grandpa Houtu, Grandpa Houtu,

40:50.086 --> 40:53.091
There's a fish. A fish. Fish.

40:55.048 --> 40:57.036
Right here. Under the well.

41:02.032 --> 41:03.016
Where did it go?

41:03.044 --> 41:05.008
I clearly saw a fish down there.

41:05.050 --> 41:08.045
The seawater has been rising due to the recent rain,

41:08.096 --> 41:10.079
which is an ill omen.

41:11.007 --> 41:12.075
We must be fully prepared.

41:18.010 --> 41:20.013
Lucky we moved fast, or we would be in trouble.

41:31.036 --> 41:32.096
Kun, you have a new home now.

41:38.016 --> 41:39.057
Chun, look here!

41:53.049 --> 41:54.070
Careful!

42:13.064 --> 42:15.029
Stay, stay away!

42:15.029 --> 42:16.012
It has two heads!

42:31.084 --> 42:32.077
Watch out!

42:48.027 --> 42:49.001
Chun,

42:50.023 --> 42:51.017
I feel drowsy.

42:52.066 --> 42:53.079
I'm going to sleep.

42:54.096 --> 42:56.064
Don't sleep. Don't sleep now.

42:57.016 --> 42:59.003
I'll sing a song for you.

43:00.062 --> 43:08.045
The moon and stars shed light over the sea,
and the rains dance in the gentle wind.

43:08.045 --> 43:09.076
That is a terrible song.

43:10.027 --> 43:11.063
You will fall asleep if it is a good one.

43:12.098 --> 43:14.099
Why the lingering? The sunset...

43:15.073 --> 43:16.043
Chun,

43:17.013 --> 43:18.021
where are we now?

43:18.049 --> 43:19.033
We're almost there.

43:20.037 --> 43:21.077
Don't sleep.

43:28.057 --> 43:29.013
Grandpa,

43:29.060 --> 43:30.044
save Qiu!

43:31.071 --> 43:34.042
Qiu's life is being endangered by the Duel-head Snake Poison,

43:35.092 --> 43:38.045
to which there is no antidote.

43:38.082 --> 43:40.022
Grandpa, please save him!

43:42.024 --> 43:43.017
Chun,

43:44.002 --> 43:45.052
this is for you.

43:45.084 --> 43:47.043
Perhaps there's a last resort.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.097
Chun, leave us. I will have a go.

44:36.055 --> 44:38.019
Boo!

44:40.056 --> 44:41.092
What are you doing?

44:42.018 --> 44:43.027
You are splattering water all over me.

44:43.093 --> 44:44.058
Qiu,

44:44.087 --> 44:45.066
you got better!

44:46.036 --> 44:48.018
Yeah. Your grandpa is really awesome.

44:48.056 --> 44:49.036
I'm totally fine now.

44:51.032 --> 44:52.096
My grandfather is in charge of herbs. He's skilled.

45:02.083 --> 45:03.058
Darling,

45:04.061 --> 45:08.036
do you still remember the place where we first met?

45:19.048 --> 45:20.037
come here.

45:21.054 --> 45:22.020
Grandpa.

45:22.081 --> 45:24.025
Your grandpa is leaving.

45:26.097 --> 45:28.070
It's all my fault.

45:29.055 --> 45:31.060
Don't blame yourself, child.

45:32.035 --> 45:35.007
Laws of nature dominate the world.

45:36.000 --> 45:38.006
No one can escape from death.

45:39.032 --> 45:43.044
I understand that you are doing something extremely dangerous

45:44.029 --> 45:46.049
and everyone is against you.

45:47.052 --> 45:49.076
But as long as you have a kind heart,

45:50.060 --> 45:53.060
their judgment will have nothing to do with you.

45:54.036 --> 45:56.051
Just follow your heart.

45:57.058 --> 45:59.064
I shall turn into a begonia tree

46:00.001 --> 46:03.057
and support you together with your grandma.

46:07.006 --> 46:09.073
My grandmother was in charge of all birds when she was alive.

46:10.039 --> 46:13.080
She turned into a phoenix after death and lived with my grandpa ever since.

46:15.002 --> 46:17.059
Two days later, grandpa passed away.

46:18.076 --> 46:21.015
That day all birds gathered around the tree,

46:22.004 --> 46:24.071
just like my grandma had come back again.

46:31.095 --> 46:34.020
Frost in summer. The seasons are in complete disarray.

46:34.090 --> 46:36.030
A catastrophe is coming.

46:41.033 --> 46:42.069
How strange it's snowing in this season!

46:43.039 --> 46:45.092
Boy, do I love snow!

46:51.082 --> 46:52.071
Do you believe in the existence of Gods?

46:53.050 --> 46:54.016
No, I don't.

46:55.019 --> 46:56.003
Well, I do.

46:56.045 --> 46:57.006
I've never seen one.

46:57.034 --> 46:58.070
Neither have the humans ever seen us,

46:58.093 --> 47:00.035
yet here we are.

47:01.060 --> 47:02.021
Were there Gods,

47:02.063 --> 47:03.066
I will most certainly be punished.

47:05.095 --> 47:07.092
Qiu, when my father and mother grow old,

47:08.053 --> 47:09.074
I'm afraid I won't be able to look after them.

47:10.054 --> 47:11.043
Why this all of a sudden?

47:12.041 --> 47:14.001
I have only half my life left now.

47:14.038 --> 47:15.067
What? Why?

47:16.057 --> 47:18.003
Half of my life was exchanged for Kun.

47:18.049 --> 47:20.018
Chun, where are you?

47:21.021 --> 47:22.029
Chun, get down!

47:22.075 --> 47:23.042
Coming!

47:23.042 --> 47:24.067
My daughter won't do anything like that.

47:24.089 --> 47:27.020
Regardless, please let her explain everything.

47:27.071 --> 47:29.087
The Elders are starting to doubt Chun.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.032
Kun is in a dangerous situation.

47:33.009 --> 47:34.088
Forgotten me already, little handsome?

47:35.034 --> 47:37.084
Hide Kun in the river of the hill in the back.

47:38.015 --> 47:40.068
Chun will be sentenced if he is discovered.

47:41.066 --> 47:42.069
Hurry!

47:59.016 --> 48:00.023
Chun will be blamed because of you.

48:01.031 --> 48:02.016
Come with me.

48:11.024 --> 48:13.002
You will be a burden if you stay with her.

48:15.012 --> 48:16.067
If you don't want her harmed,

48:28.055 --> 48:29.020
Where's Kun?

48:31.017 --> 48:32.066
Released him where?

48:32.075 --> 48:33.045
He is free now

48:37.072 --> 48:38.019
Chun,

48:38.075 --> 48:39.078
it was all for your sake!

49:38.075 --> 49:41.070
My precious, finally you are in my hands.

49:42.087 --> 49:45.058
With your help, I will be able to go to the human world.

50:01.042 --> 50:03.011
I thought I would never see you again.

50:10.038 --> 50:11.074
We must find a way out.

50:12.091 --> 50:13.068
Let's follow them.

53:03.022 --> 53:04.020
My parents died when I was very young.

53:04.086 --> 53:06.021
Grandma brought me up by herself.

53:06.096 --> 53:09.041
Nobody supervised me and I'm afraid of nothing.

53:09.077 --> 53:11.004
But there is

53:11.069 --> 53:12.062
one thing I can't bear.

53:13.037 --> 53:14.059
Your suffering.

53:21.033 --> 53:22.055
I never thought this would happen.

53:23.053 --> 53:25.007
I didn't know he was so important to you.

53:26.067 --> 53:27.074
I'm scared

53:28.077 --> 53:29.089
that they might hurt you.

53:32.075 --> 53:33.097
Would you please wake up?

54:46.001 --> 54:47.045
Kun.

55:45.099 --> 55:48.033
Kun, it must be you who woke me up.

55:48.089 --> 55:50.015
You've grown much bigger.

55:51.074 --> 55:53.039
I don't want to be separated from you.

56:34.012 --> 56:35.015
It's your turn.

56:35.061 --> 56:36.050
What bad tiles.

56:38.037 --> 56:40.030
Come on in now that you've here.

56:46.021 --> 56:47.061
Sorry to bother you.

56:47.090 --> 56:48.059
Meld.

56:51.042 --> 56:52.064
I would like to ask a question.

56:54.027 --> 56:56.015
Why did you hand over a human soul to Chun?

56:57.074 --> 56:58.096
That's the deal between us.

56:59.056 --> 57:01.016
With a high enough price,

57:01.067 --> 57:03.073
there's nothing in the world that can't be exchanged.

57:05.037 --> 57:06.049
Is it half of her life?

57:07.080 --> 57:09.030
Why asking when you already know it?

57:11.031 --> 57:12.009
If I may ask,

57:12.009 --> 57:14.004
can I exchange my life

57:15.099 --> 57:17.002
Of course you can.

57:17.031 --> 57:18.080
But the price has gone up.

57:19.017 --> 57:21.032
You must exchange your whole life for hers.

57:24.046 --> 57:26.006
But I must remind you

57:26.033 --> 57:28.000
she is not saved even if you give up your life.

57:28.006 --> 57:29.080
Half of the girl's life

57:29.080 --> 57:31.045
is intertwined with the big fish.

57:31.081 --> 57:33.045
She dies the minute the fish dies.

57:34.015 --> 57:35.032
What if the fish is sent away?

57:36.044 --> 57:38.027
If the fish is sent away...

57:38.040 --> 57:39.030
The day when the fish is sent away

57:39.030 --> 57:40.056
is the day of her death.

57:42.027 --> 57:43.053
Is there any way I can save her?

57:45.068 --> 57:47.079
Melding my own discard. Flower!

57:50.036 --> 57:52.094
Come play mahjong with me. I'll tell you if you win.

57:54.011 --> 57:55.013
But there are already four of you.

57:56.068 --> 57:57.057
Seat available now.

58:13.085 --> 58:15.083
Lucky me. I win.

58:21.043 --> 58:22.056
There is no such thing as luck.

58:22.084 --> 58:25.018
Good luck or bad luck, it's nothing but fate.

58:30.095 --> 58:33.011
The way to save her rests within your hands.

58:33.053 --> 58:34.028
Within my hands?

58:35.049 --> 58:37.079
The way to save her rests within your hands.

58:38.007 --> 58:39.061
Within your hands.

58:54.024 --> 58:55.069
Thank you for your advice.

58:56.025 --> 58:57.037
You youngsters

58:57.037 --> 58:59.092
treat life as if it were rocks on the roadside,

58:59.092 --> 59:01.061
while we old people

59:01.061 --> 59:04.045
try everything we can to live one more day.

59:05.099 --> 59:08.028
Without happiness, what's the meaning of longevity?

01:00:30.037 --> 01:00:32.057
I tried to forget something, but I couldn't.

01:00:32.099 --> 01:00:34.007
If you can't,  then don't.

01:00:34.039 --> 01:00:36.027
Real forgetting requires no efforts.

01:00:38.010 --> 01:00:39.003
But I am miserable.

01:00:39.087 --> 01:00:41.098
Misery is sometimes a good thing.

01:00:43.085 --> 01:00:45.063
Is there any medicine that can make me forget my miseries?

01:00:46.037 --> 01:00:47.031
I have but one sort of medicine,

01:00:47.069 --> 01:00:50.008
which can relieve you of all your miseries as well as your happiness.

01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:52.032
It is known as Soup of Lady Meng.

01:00:55.074 --> 01:00:57.014
In that case, I prefer a bottle of wine.

01:01:03.018 --> 01:01:04.073
Do you have antidotes for hangover?

01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:20.074
Whose love do you think you've been receiving?

01:01:19.014 --> 01:01:27.085
Note: He is likely referring to himself in this monologue.

01:01:21.006 --> 01:01:22.061
It is the love of a God!

01:01:22.093 --> 01:01:24.086
He betrayed all Gods, out of love for you.

01:01:24.093 --> 01:01:26.020
He suffered countless pains

01:01:26.068 --> 01:01:27.085
and brought you happiness.

01:01:35.039 --> 01:01:37.082
The seawater is rising. The heavens are in a fury.

01:01:41.029 --> 01:01:43.077
Things of ill omen must be removed.

01:01:48.012 --> 01:01:49.090
I can tell you where the big fish is

01:01:50.070 --> 01:01:55.038
as long as you break the spell on me so that I can see the sunlight again.

01:02:00.062 --> 01:02:02.058
Dirty things are prevalent down there.

01:02:03.047 --> 01:02:05.053
Might as well have some cleaning.

01:02:07.007 --> 01:02:09.070
Are you ready, precious darlings?

01:02:12.032 --> 01:02:17.089
The big fish has come, and it's time to move my home.

01:02:18.073 --> 01:02:24.044
Towards the mountaintop, where my new home will reside.

01:02:25.028 --> 01:02:31.032
Bitter wind and fierce storm blow thousands of homes away,

01:02:32.002 --> 01:02:38.062
yet I am not afraid, because my home can be anywhere.

01:02:39.004 --> 01:02:42.041
Because my home can be anywhere.

01:02:50.029 --> 01:02:51.060
Grandma Qiu, Grandma Qiu,

01:02:51.085 --> 01:02:52.055
Emergency!

01:02:52.075 --> 01:02:53.087
The Mask of the Dragon was stolen!

01:03:07.059 --> 01:03:08.020
Chun!

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.048
Chun, do you know how long I've been looking for you?

01:03:12.079 --> 01:03:15.013
Listen to me. Let go of this monster.

01:03:15.069 --> 01:03:17.075
He is no monster. You will not harm him.

01:03:18.031 --> 01:03:19.062
What a disobedient girl!

01:03:21.021 --> 01:03:22.062
I'm sorry, mom.

01:03:33.050 --> 01:03:35.009
Feng, why do you stop?

01:03:36.026 --> 01:03:37.010
Go get them!

01:03:38.004 --> 01:03:39.031
Let me.

01:03:39.077 --> 01:03:40.019
Step aside.

01:03:48.086 --> 01:03:50.072
Kun, let's get out of here.

01:03:52.063 --> 01:03:53.057
Don't let them run away!

01:03:55.039 --> 01:03:57.011
Kun, faster!

01:04:02.065 --> 01:04:04.096
Chun, go now!

01:04:04.096 --> 01:04:07.005
I'll help you send Kun home.

01:04:07.042 --> 01:04:08.058
Good heavens.

01:04:08.058 --> 01:04:09.043
Chun,

01:04:09.043 --> 01:04:12.008
you must go with Kun, now!

01:04:12.078 --> 01:04:14.048
Qiu, you don't know what you are doing!

01:04:14.048 --> 01:04:16.059
Your magical capability is not enough to open the sky.

01:04:28.081 --> 01:04:31.034
Not good. Somebody find Grandma Qiu!

01:04:31.081 --> 01:04:34.061
Go, now! I'm losing it!

01:04:35.008 --> 01:04:36.030
Kun, faster!

01:04:36.059 --> 01:04:38.004
Kun, speed up!

01:04:41.046 --> 01:04:43.070
Finally I'm back, human world!

01:04:44.050 --> 01:04:46.051
Thanks to your help, little handsome.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.077
I'll miss you in the human world.

01:04:52.073 --> 01:04:54.046
This is a disaster.

01:04:55.066 --> 01:04:57.006
Without a token from the human world,

01:04:57.006 --> 01:04:59.046
you won't be able to go through the Gate.

01:05:55.081 --> 01:05:57.036
Grandpa saved us.

01:06:09.054 --> 01:06:10.062
Kun.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:18.056
Kun. It's going to hurt.

01:06:21.079 --> 01:06:24.019
Ever since I met you and our fates entwined,

01:06:24.073 --> 01:06:26.020
I have never once regretted.

01:06:37.073 --> 01:06:39.081
Brother Songzi, why isn't Brother Zhurong with you?

01:06:39.081 --> 01:06:40.063
We're going to find him.

01:06:46.063 --> 01:06:47.042
Grandma.

01:06:49.016 --> 01:06:50.000
Someone's down there.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.016
Let's go get them.

01:06:51.048 --> 01:06:53.070
Help! Somebody help us!

01:06:58.066 --> 01:06:59.059
Save my sister first!

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:06.031
Brother.

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.040
Has anyone seen Qiu?

01:07:09.057 --> 01:07:11.026
Tingmu is still in the water. I'll get him.

01:07:11.096 --> 01:07:12.085
I'm going with you.

01:07:14.013 --> 01:07:21.001
Tingmu!

01:07:31.057 --> 01:07:33.049
Kun, we can't give up.

01:07:35.017 --> 01:07:37.020
You must fly through the Gate of Sea and Sky.

01:07:42.043 --> 01:07:44.023
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

01:07:44.058 --> 01:07:45.070
Grandpa is here for me.

01:07:47.044 --> 01:07:49.017
You idiot. Leave now.

01:07:49.068 --> 01:07:50.043
Now!

01:07:57.058 --> 01:07:58.029
There's the monster!

01:08:00.095 --> 01:08:02.017
It won't get away this time!

01:08:02.055 --> 01:08:03.030
Lives are more important.

01:08:03.067 --> 01:08:04.079
Let's find Tingmu first.

01:08:05.022 --> 01:08:06.001
We can't let it run loose.

01:08:06.053 --> 01:08:07.060
It will only invite more catastrophe.

01:08:48.004 --> 01:08:49.087
Grandpa. What should I do?

01:08:54.066 --> 01:08:55.087
What should I do?

01:09:14.063 --> 01:09:17.072
Grandpa.

01:09:38.018 --> 01:09:39.017
Grandma.

01:09:52.076 --> 01:09:53.037
Kun.

01:09:55.092 --> 01:09:57.084
Let him go. He's innocent.

01:09:58.041 --> 01:09:59.038
Why would you do that?

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:01.095
He died saving me, and I'm giving him life in return.

01:10:02.070 --> 01:10:03.087
His sister is still waiting for him.

01:10:04.062 --> 01:10:06.059
Do you know that Tingmu has been swallowed by the flood

01:10:06.078 --> 01:10:07.094
and his sister is also waiting for him?

01:10:19.059 --> 01:10:21.018
Everybody, run!

01:10:22.078 --> 01:10:25.068
Build a bridge! To the top of the highest mountain!

01:10:26.014 --> 01:10:27.030
Feng, help me!

01:10:38.093 --> 01:10:40.052
Not good. It's an emergency.

01:10:40.076 --> 01:10:41.032
We need to go back.

01:10:49.013 --> 01:10:50.085
I can't accompany you on your final trip.

01:10:51.023 --> 01:10:52.044
I need to help my family.

01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:06.014
Tingmu!/ Brother!

01:11:06.014 --> 01:11:07.021
Did you find Tingmu?

01:11:07.057 --> 01:11:08.037
We didn't.

01:11:08.082 --> 01:11:09.047
What?

01:11:09.057 --> 01:11:10.028
I'm sorry.

01:11:11.072 --> 01:11:13.041
I want my brother back!

01:11:26.057 --> 01:11:28.046
Mom, let me help.

01:11:31.051 --> 01:11:32.076
We don't need you!

01:11:35.068 --> 01:11:38.027
Leave, young child.

01:11:38.057 --> 01:11:40.042
Give me my Tingmu.

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:20.006
Hurry up! Follow the lead!

01:13:06.019 --> 01:13:07.060
This is all my fault.

01:13:08.007 --> 01:13:09.089
I can't bear everybody suffering because of me.

01:13:10.092 --> 01:13:11.072
But Kun,

01:13:12.028 --> 01:13:13.055
you must fly higher in every effort.

01:13:14.048 --> 01:13:15.061
You will leave this place.

01:13:17.085 --> 01:13:19.039
I want to see you live a wonderful life

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:21.036
as you used to.

01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:24.002
I have faith in you.

01:13:30.090 --> 01:13:32.083
Grandpa, I'm coming to you.

01:15:06.063 --> 01:15:07.070
Mom!

01:15:08.092 --> 01:15:11.054
Mom, I'm here!

01:15:11.054 --> 01:15:12.072
Brother!/ Tingmu!

01:16:47.047 --> 01:16:50.010
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

01:17:21.037 --> 01:17:22.063
Why didn't you leave?

01:17:25.039 --> 01:17:27.036
These are some clothes made by Leizu.

01:17:27.064 --> 01:17:29.060
Try them on and see if they fit.

01:17:30.063 --> 01:17:31.038
Thank you.

01:17:34.038 --> 01:17:35.050
Why am I here?

01:17:36.015 --> 01:17:37.018
Shouldn't I be dead?

01:17:37.037 --> 01:17:38.036
I saved you.

01:17:38.064 --> 01:17:40.056
But you've lost your capacity for magic

01:17:40.093 --> 01:17:42.033
and no longer belong in this place.

01:17:42.066 --> 01:17:43.064
What about the others?

01:17:44.002 --> 01:17:46.013
Rest assured. You saved everyone.

01:17:46.092 --> 01:17:49.068
This apocalypse has connected the water and the land.

01:17:50.057 --> 01:17:53.052
If you go south, you will reach the Southernmost Heaven's Lake

01:17:53.084 --> 01:17:55.086
where you can accompany him for the last time.

01:17:58.001 --> 01:17:59.042
when he returns to the human world,

01:17:59.079 --> 01:18:01.062
he will have no memory of you.

01:18:02.064 --> 01:18:03.044
That's fine.

01:18:05.032 --> 01:18:07.023
Please tell my mother that I'm still alive.

01:18:13.069 --> 01:18:14.051
Thank you.

01:18:15.069 --> 01:18:19.035
There's no need. I'm a businessman.

01:18:19.078 --> 01:18:23.005
You should thank the one who traded your life back.

01:18:35.082 --> 01:18:38.058
Chun

01:18:39.027 --> 01:18:41.014
Wait for me!

01:18:41.052 --> 01:18:43.020
I'm going with you!

01:18:45.035 --> 01:18:46.033
Help!

01:18:46.061 --> 01:18:47.074
I can't swim!

01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:10.000
What's on your mind?

01:19:11.022 --> 01:19:12.053
So many stars.

01:19:15.010 --> 01:19:16.050
Every time I look up at the sky,

01:19:17.021 --> 01:19:18.075
I feel I'm being summoned.

01:19:21.028 --> 01:19:22.040
If one dies,

01:19:22.087 --> 01:19:24.074
he won't be able to see the beauty of the sky.

01:19:25.096 --> 01:19:27.041
Do you believe in eternal love?

01:19:27.073 --> 01:19:28.095
Just like stars?

01:19:29.094 --> 01:19:30.073
I do.

01:19:32.051 --> 01:19:33.054
After Kun is back,

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:35.050
let's go home together.

01:19:36.011 --> 01:19:37.037
I've lost my magic.

01:19:37.056 --> 01:19:38.050
I can't go back.

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:41.006
The human world is a spectacular place.

01:19:41.061 --> 01:19:43.012
Do you want to live there?

01:19:43.072 --> 01:19:44.065
Together with Kun?

01:19:45.031 --> 01:19:48.041
That's impossible. We are from different worlds.

01:19:49.038 --> 01:19:50.046
I wasn't asking about the possibility.

01:19:51.006 --> 01:19:52.044
I was asking if you would like to.

01:20:04.015 --> 01:20:06.059
I like to watch you having food.

01:20:06.095 --> 01:20:08.038
You look beautiful when you are eating.

01:20:12.076 --> 01:20:14.016
I've seen all kinds of you.

01:20:14.091 --> 01:20:15.084
Naughty you,

01:20:16.017 --> 01:20:17.025
angry you,

01:20:17.067 --> 01:20:18.070
sad you,

01:20:19.036 --> 01:20:20.057
embarrassed you,

01:20:21.018 --> 01:20:22.035
are all charming.

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:25.011
For me, you are like a big brother.

01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.064
Alright then.

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:44.013
Are you asleep?

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:48.039
Are you cold?

01:20:49.098 --> 01:20:50.069
Then sleep tight.

01:20:51.057 --> 01:20:52.016
Okay.

01:20:59.045 --> 01:21:01.047
thank you for being with me the whole time.

01:21:02.045 --> 01:21:05.021
No one treats me better than you in the world.

01:22:18.064 --> 01:22:20.043
Will we ever meet again?

01:22:21.012 --> 01:22:22.058
Will we get to know each other again?

01:22:24.054 --> 01:22:26.047
We will reunite.

01:22:27.007 --> 01:22:29.037
no matter what we may look like,

01:22:29.041 --> 01:22:32.031
we will recognize one another.

01:23:25.018 --> 01:23:26.098
Kun!

01:24:31.050 --> 01:24:32.053
Go.

01:24:33.065 --> 01:24:34.072
Go home now.

01:26:42.085 --> 01:26:43.032
Qiu.

01:26:43.089 --> 01:26:45.092
Come here. Take my hands.

01:26:47.044 --> 01:26:49.061
Hurry. We're running out of time!

01:26:53.038 --> 01:26:54.037
What's the matter, Qiu?

01:26:54.088 --> 01:26:56.010
I'm going to send you

01:26:56.047 --> 01:26:57.051
to Kun's world.

01:26:58.067 --> 01:27:00.017
I thought we were going home together.

01:27:00.073 --> 01:27:02.028
I traded back your life from the Soul Keeper,

01:27:02.056 --> 01:27:04.020
and I will send you to the human world.

01:27:05.093 --> 01:27:09.076
No.

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.024
listen,

01:27:12.052 --> 01:27:13.032
Chun,

01:27:14.042 --> 01:27:15.002
promise me

01:27:15.089 --> 01:27:17.062
that you will hold onto my hands and never let go.

01:27:18.051 --> 01:27:19.068
I have to send you away.

01:27:20.024 --> 01:27:22.059
We will meet again, believe me.

01:27:25.086 --> 01:27:26.076
My deepest regret

01:27:27.023 --> 01:27:29.034
is that I didn't hold you in my arms during our last night together.

01:27:30.016 --> 01:27:31.029
You will live a happy life.

01:27:31.099 --> 01:27:33.016
Follow me.

01:27:38.003 --> 01:27:39.062
On the count of three, jump with me.

01:27:41.012 --> 01:27:42.020
You have to trust me!

01:27:43.093 --> 01:27:44.044
One,

01:27:46.093 --> 01:27:47.053
three!

01:27:54.027 --> 01:27:56.098
I will be the wind and rain with you in the human world.

01:28:03.021 --> 01:28:04.005
Farewell.

01:29:24.095 --> 01:29:26.058
Do you believe in miracles?

01:29:28.046 --> 01:29:30.075
Life is a journey

01:29:31.050 --> 01:29:33.032
that we have to wait for countless reincarnations

01:29:33.056 --> 01:29:36.060
before we get the privilege to enjoy it.

01:29:38.019 --> 01:29:41.065
At the end of our short life, we will eventually lose everything.

01:29:42.064 --> 01:29:44.037
Therefore you might just as well embolden yourself

01:29:45.002 --> 01:29:46.029
to love someone,

01:29:46.085 --> 01:29:48.011
to climb a mountain,

01:29:48.063 --> 01:29:49.094
or to pursue a dream.

01:29:51.030 --> 01:29:54.001
Yes, you might just as well embolden yourself.

01:29:56.044 --> 01:29:59.006
There are many things that I don't understand,

01:29:59.072 --> 01:30:02.039
and there are many questions that carry no answers.

01:30:03.028 --> 01:30:07.011
But I do believe that the very reason why the heavens bless us with lives

01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:11.014
is to let us make miracles.

01:30:11.014 --> 01:30:14.067
Note: There are still a few seconds in the end.

01:34:18.057 --> 01:34:19.065
It's time.

01:34:36.026 --> 01:34:37.034
From now on,

01:34:37.085 --> 01:34:39.087
you will be my successor.

01:34:40.098 --> 01:34:49.082
In ancient history there was a tree called Ta-khun,
whose spring (Chun) was 8000 years, and its autumn (Qiu) the same.
