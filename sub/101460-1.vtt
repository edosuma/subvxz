04:12.011 --> 04:13.145
Show yourself.

04:26.158 --> 04:27.592
Let me see your hands.

04:32.932 --> 04:33.866
Both of 'em.

04:37.169 --> 04:38.704
I wasn't going to use it.

04:40.239 --> 04:41.473
I can't hear you.

04:46.979 --> 04:49.481
I said,
I wasn't going to use it.

04:49.514 --> 04:50.582
Good to know.

04:53.653 --> 04:54.586
Now, put it away.

04:59.926 --> 05:01.861
Lips, quiet.

05:04.830 --> 05:05.831
You alone?

05:08.234 --> 05:09.567
You telling me the truth?

05:23.615 --> 05:24.549
What's your name?

05:28.586 --> 05:29.454
Sonny.

05:29.889 --> 05:31.824
Well, Sonny, my name is Emma.

05:34.994 --> 05:36.662
Got any other weapons?

05:38.230 --> 05:39.098
No.

05:52.645 --> 05:53.511
You hungry?

05:56.248 --> 05:57.249
You look hungry.

06:12.798 --> 06:13.866
Have a seat.

06:30.016 --> 06:30.916
Squirrel jerky.

06:31.583 --> 06:33.052
It's not as bad as it sounds.

06:42.594 --> 06:43.595
Does that dog bite?

06:45.931 --> 06:46.999
That's Lips.

06:49.769 --> 06:51.603
And he only bites
if I tell him to.

06:53.672 --> 06:54.606
Lips?

06:55.241 --> 06:56.642
Why do you call him that?

06:57.109 --> 06:59.278
My daughter named him.
You'd have to ask her.

07:03.649 --> 07:04.616
But you can't.

07:09.321 --> 07:10.689
Lips.

07:11.157 --> 07:12.224
Check him out.

07:13.659 --> 07:16.095
If you scratch him behind his left
ear, he might love you for life.

07:28.908 --> 07:31.677
- Something wrong with your teeth?
- Yeah.

07:32.778 --> 07:33.646
Let me see.

07:36.882 --> 07:38.050
It's okay.

07:41.787 --> 07:42.655
Hmm.

07:46.158 --> 07:48.127
Yeah, it's looking pretty nasty
in there.

07:49.829 --> 07:51.964
Those braces aren't helping
much either, are they?

07:51.997 --> 07:54.633
No, I've been trying
to get them off.

07:55.968 --> 07:59.138
I have a toothbrush you can use if
you wanna try and get the gunk out.

08:09.115 --> 08:10.349
Would you eat that dog?

08:13.252 --> 08:14.854
Dog, maybe.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.357
Lips, never.

08:21.160 --> 08:22.928
Not much meat on him anyway.

08:25.164 --> 08:26.165
Kinda like you.

08:49.355 --> 08:50.923
Where are we going?

08:51.724 --> 08:53.292
It's not safe to stay put.

08:54.460 --> 08:55.394
Not anymore.

08:56.996 --> 08:59.231
So, where are we going?

09:00.733 --> 09:04.336
We're gonna go see a guy I know
who used to be a dentist.

09:04.370 --> 09:05.804
At least I think he was.

09:06.338 --> 09:08.174
He might be able to help you
with your teeth.

09:13.812 --> 09:15.181
That is if you want to.

09:17.249 --> 09:18.217
Maybe I will.

09:19.285 --> 09:20.219
Maybe I won't.

09:21.954 --> 09:22.821
Hmm.

09:24.390 --> 09:25.424
Suit yourself.

09:47.780 --> 09:48.814
Come on, Lips.

10:19.411 --> 10:22.414
<i>♪ Row, row your boat
Gently down the stream ♪</i>

10:23.115 --> 10:25.417
<i>♪ Merrily, merrily
Merrily, merrily ♪</i>

10:25.451 --> 10:27.152
<i>♪ Life is but a dream ♪</i>

10:27.186 --> 10:28.053
Scream!

10:32.925 --> 10:35.894
We never know
who could be near, do we?

10:38.864 --> 10:39.531
Okay.

10:53.345 --> 10:54.280
Don't drink that.

10:56.415 --> 10:57.983
You need to boil it first.

11:08.193 --> 11:09.561
We're gonna need some firewood.

11:11.163 --> 11:12.831
Go and put this to good use.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.998
I gotta say somethin'.

11:47.066 --> 11:47.933
Say it.

11:48.967 --> 11:50.302
You smell pretty bad.

11:55.574 --> 11:59.044
That's rich coming from a feral
kid that smells like ass.

12:03.215 --> 12:04.483
I don't smell.

12:05.150 --> 12:08.120
Oh, honey, you do.

12:08.153 --> 12:11.123
But don't take it personal,
everybody smells bad these days.

12:11.924 --> 12:13.859
Hey, there's another one.

12:18.997 --> 12:20.667
Oh! Die!

12:20.700 --> 12:22.935
- What does feral mean?
- Just like that.

12:23.402 --> 12:25.137
It means us on our bad days.

13:10.149 --> 13:11.917
Good boy, Lips.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.391
Sorry, Mr. Rabbit.

13:20.359 --> 13:22.194
Wrong time, wrong place.

13:22.629 --> 13:24.329
You didn't say he could hunt.

13:26.165 --> 13:28.534
Bring your knife,
I'll show you how to skin it.

13:30.569 --> 13:31.704
Do I have to?

13:32.404 --> 13:34.039
Yeah, you do.

13:57.496 --> 13:58.665
Where are you going?

13:58.698 --> 14:02.635
I'm going to pee. I mean,
if that's all right with you.

14:02.669 --> 14:04.069
Don't go too far.

14:06.371 --> 14:07.606
How far is far?

14:08.708 --> 14:09.975
Geez.

14:28.060 --> 14:29.194
Shut that dog up.

14:29.228 --> 14:30.697
Lips.

14:33.098 --> 14:34.333
What do you want?

14:36.736 --> 14:39.438
You got food, you got fire.

14:40.472 --> 14:42.040
What more can a man want?

14:43.442 --> 14:44.610
What do you say, missy?

14:45.210 --> 14:49.214
Sorry. I'm feelin' antisocial.

14:50.683 --> 14:51.583
Move on now.

14:54.152 --> 14:55.254
Think about it.

14:56.588 --> 14:58.323
You're gonna take
the both of us?

15:09.468 --> 15:12.204
You are gonna die, you bitch!

15:49.474 --> 15:51.243
Emma. Emma.

15:51.711 --> 15:52.712
Emma!

16:07.192 --> 16:08.527
Emma, I got blood on my hands.

16:12.497 --> 16:14.333
Emma, I have blood on my hands.

16:15.534 --> 16:18.103
It's okay, it's okay.

16:21.708 --> 16:22.574
Let me see.

16:23.575 --> 16:27.346
Come here, come here.
It's okay, it's okay.

16:30.215 --> 16:31.216
We're gonna be okay.

16:32.551 --> 16:33.418
Okay?

17:17.496 --> 17:19.632
Goddammit, quit moving.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.850
It'll hurt a whole hell of a
lot less if you just sit still.

17:45.658 --> 17:47.392
Fucking piece of shit.

17:54.433 --> 17:55.935
Hey, hey.

17:56.936 --> 17:58.403
Sonny, what the hell?

17:58.437 --> 18:00.773
He lied,
he said it wouldn't hurt.

18:00.807 --> 18:02.875
He's trying to help you.

18:03.843 --> 18:05.912
Yeah, then why was he laughing?

18:06.679 --> 18:07.647
Was I laughing?

18:07.680 --> 18:10.215
Yes, you were.

18:14.887 --> 18:19.291
That tooth should come out,
along with the braces.

18:19.324 --> 18:21.359
Not a chance, dickweed.

18:21.393 --> 18:24.463
That tooth can get a whole
lot worse, Sonny-boy.

18:28.668 --> 18:32.772
You know, I'm sorry about Janey.

18:35.307 --> 18:36.408
She was a good kid.

18:37.844 --> 18:38.945
Is that your daughter?

18:40.947 --> 18:42.280
Well, what did happen to her?

18:43.816 --> 18:44.684
She's gone.

18:45.350 --> 18:46.853
What do you mean gone?

18:50.388 --> 18:51.991
Do you think
she could still be alive?

18:54.694 --> 18:57.663
I cannot talk about it.

18:59.464 --> 19:00.332
I cannot.

19:10.877 --> 19:12.979
I see you still got
that little dog of hers.

19:14.613 --> 19:16.949
It is truly amazing
that thing is still moving.

19:16.983 --> 19:20.653
He's not a thing,
and his name is Lips.

19:20.686 --> 19:24.289
Yeah, right, Lips.

19:25.825 --> 19:27.860
Fast little rodent as I recall.

19:27.894 --> 19:29.695
Leave him alone, asswipe.

19:33.032 --> 19:34.366
Enough!

19:40.106 --> 19:42.008
Rodent.

19:59.158 --> 20:00.059
Come on, Lips.

20:02.929 --> 20:05.463
Emma, I think we should
head back south.

20:09.068 --> 20:09.936
Emma?

20:26.618 --> 20:27.820
Sonny, why are...

20:30.156 --> 20:31.824
Oh, Sonny.

20:33.159 --> 20:35.761
Hm, did you say something?

20:37.495 --> 20:39.765
- Go back to sleep.
- Alright.

20:44.837 --> 20:45.705
Hey.

20:47.974 --> 20:51.476
Raoul and I have, uh,
we have history.

20:52.912 --> 20:55.982
We were friends from before.

20:58.784 --> 21:01.120
Whatever.
It's none of my business.

21:08.995 --> 21:11.898
I just can't believe we came
all this way for that guy.

21:12.597 --> 21:14.166
He knows what he's doing,
believe it or not.

21:18.104 --> 21:20.773
Something up? Is someone coming?

21:24.677 --> 21:28.714
Well, I'm gonna go
make breakfast. Ow.

21:30.582 --> 21:31.616
History, huh?

21:32.084 --> 21:33.853
I hope your mouth hurts.

21:38.925 --> 21:40.793
I think we should
head back south.

21:45.231 --> 21:46.766
South, why?

21:47.867 --> 21:50.002
That's our best bet
where Janey could be.

21:50.836 --> 21:51.837
Why do you say that?

21:52.738 --> 21:54.140
Well, there's more people
down there.

21:54.173 --> 21:59.045
People. You ought to know by now
that people are best to be avoided.

22:00.913 --> 22:04.116
I just think that if she's
alive, maybe we could find her.

22:05.251 --> 22:07.619
I know you wanna help me
find Janey,

22:08.586 --> 22:11.023
and I want that
more than anything.

22:13.192 --> 22:14.727
We don't even know
where to look.

22:15.795 --> 22:17.897
Were you looking for her
when you found me?

22:17.930 --> 22:21.767
Someone told me they saw a girl
by the tower where we first met.

22:22.969 --> 22:27.539
They described her and it sounded
close enough to take a chance.

22:30.276 --> 22:32.544
I was hoping Lips
might lead me to her.

22:33.946 --> 22:35.014
At least I found you.

22:38.217 --> 22:39.251
Lips!

22:47.193 --> 22:49.962
Lips isn't back.
We need to go find him.

22:49.996 --> 22:51.596
Sonny, he'll come back.

22:52.965 --> 22:55.835
But what if he doesn't?
What if someone takes him or kills him?

22:56.601 --> 22:57.269
It could happen.

22:58.337 --> 22:59.571
Not helping.

23:01.606 --> 23:05.144
- He'll come back. He always does.
- Fine, I'll do this on my own.

23:20.893 --> 23:22.328
So maybe you wanna come help?

23:22.361 --> 23:24.930
Help with what? Get killed?

23:26.165 --> 23:28.134
No, I'm good.

23:33.773 --> 23:35.241
What about breakfast?

24:03.069 --> 24:04.170
Goddammit, Sonny.

24:09.108 --> 24:09.975
Lips.

24:15.648 --> 24:16.849
Lips.

24:29.695 --> 24:31.097
You here by yourself?

24:31.864 --> 24:33.065
I'm with them.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.004
I'm looking for my dog.

24:40.072 --> 24:41.606
Have you seen a dog?

24:47.379 --> 24:49.215
Stay away from him!

24:53.853 --> 24:55.788
They're on the second floor.

24:57.256 --> 24:58.224
Don't let them see you.

25:03.829 --> 25:05.831
Mom, I'm scared.

25:18.978 --> 25:20.846
I was just looking for my dog.

25:21.280 --> 25:22.448
I wasn't going to hurt him.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.649
Shut up.

25:24.984 --> 25:26.752
Where are we going?

25:26.785 --> 25:29.054
Getting inside
before your people come.

25:29.488 --> 25:31.056
What people?

25:31.090 --> 25:33.893
I'm alone. I told you,
I was just looking for my dog.

25:36.962 --> 25:39.431
So, what's the deal
with the rhino head?

25:39.465 --> 25:41.767
She wears it all the time.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.702
It's who I am now.

25:43.736 --> 25:44.904
You're a rhino?

25:46.305 --> 25:48.874
Well, it scared
the piss outta me.

25:49.875 --> 25:51.377
Pissy piss-piss.

26:03.322 --> 26:04.723
Where did you find him?

26:05.191 --> 26:06.725
He was by the Smith family.

26:10.429 --> 26:11.830
Can we keep him?

26:11.864 --> 26:14.433
Keep me?
I'm not gonna be your pet.

26:15.334 --> 26:18.904
Don't worry about it.
I got this under control.

26:32.484 --> 26:33.919
Move backward.

26:39.225 --> 26:42.761
My name is Melanie
and you may not call me Mel.

27:35.414 --> 27:36.282
What?

27:38.851 --> 27:39.885
What?

27:40.352 --> 27:41.553
What's your name?

27:42.454 --> 27:43.355
Sonny.

27:45.090 --> 27:46.558
I'm Oscar.

27:46.592 --> 27:49.328
- That's Maddy.
- Nice to meet you.

27:50.896 --> 27:52.331
Is that your toy?

27:53.065 --> 27:54.433
It's my telescope.

27:55.267 --> 27:56.302
It's a tool.

28:07.012 --> 28:08.547
I don't think I can eat that.

28:09.448 --> 28:11.283
It's edible. Eat it.

28:11.317 --> 28:12.551
No, I can't.

28:13.687 --> 28:16.255
My mouth is all
messed up because of the braces.

28:16.622 --> 28:19.591
Yeah, I know about that.

28:21.260 --> 28:24.196
You know,
I was really looking for my dog.

28:24.229 --> 28:26.365
No, that's what we don't know.

28:26.398 --> 28:28.367
We don't know who you're with.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.502
I told you, I'm alone.

28:31.103 --> 28:33.072
Only the dead are alone.

28:33.105 --> 28:35.407
The hanging people aren't alone.

28:36.575 --> 28:38.243
That's not what she means.

28:38.277 --> 28:39.646
Well, then what does she mean?

28:39.679 --> 28:42.214
I mean, that he could have
people nearby.

28:42.247 --> 28:44.049
People who could hurt us.

28:44.083 --> 28:47.052
He's just looking for his dog
and I like him.

28:48.187 --> 28:49.922
See, he gets it.

28:50.389 --> 28:52.191
I don't believe him.

28:52.224 --> 28:54.993
So, what are you gonna do,
cook me up?

28:56.028 --> 28:57.963
Could certainly solve
our problem.

28:58.430 --> 28:59.865
Very funny.

29:03.569 --> 29:05.304
There's nothing funny here.

29:05.337 --> 29:06.673
Just stop talking.

29:06.706 --> 29:08.540
All right, all right.

30:17.242 --> 30:18.110
Do you live here?

30:18.577 --> 30:19.646
Not here.

30:19.679 --> 30:21.346
Over there.

30:23.248 --> 30:25.017
Don't talk to her.

30:25.517 --> 30:26.686
You shouldn't have come here.

30:27.486 --> 30:29.988
You need to go. Now!

30:31.758 --> 30:33.292
I'm looking for my friend.

30:34.661 --> 30:37.563
A boy about your age.

30:38.230 --> 30:39.465
You mean Sonny?

30:39.498 --> 30:40.999
Oscar, quiet.

30:41.634 --> 30:42.601
Have you seen him?

30:43.435 --> 30:44.671
He's in jail.

30:45.638 --> 30:48.540
Please, let me see him.

30:59.652 --> 31:00.720
Can I see him?

31:01.921 --> 31:07.192
I'll take you, but if you touch
any of us, I'll brain you.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.027
Noted.

31:14.634 --> 31:16.602
Janey!

31:17.603 --> 31:19.772
- Come out.
- We know you're in there.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.809
Maybe they followed me,
I don't know.

31:22.842 --> 31:24.309
What's the matter?

31:24.343 --> 31:25.611
It's not your fault.

31:25.645 --> 31:26.612
Come on out.

31:26.646 --> 31:28.280
But we gotta get out of here.

31:30.182 --> 31:33.252
What if they catch us or there's
another nano-strike thing?

31:35.287 --> 31:37.589
All I know is that we're not
safe here anymore, okay?

31:37.623 --> 31:39.157
We're better off
if we're on the move.

31:39.191 --> 31:40.827
Okay, come here. Come here.

31:44.162 --> 31:46.164
- It's gonna be okay.
- Mom.

31:46.198 --> 31:49.201
I just wanna be friends.

31:52.404 --> 31:57.342
Janey, Janey, Janey.
Come down, come down.

31:57.376 --> 31:58.610
I got this.

32:06.151 --> 32:07.452
Mom!

32:08.888 --> 32:10.222
Mom!

32:10.255 --> 32:11.490
Let go of her.

32:26.605 --> 32:27.472
You okay?

32:28.641 --> 32:29.508
Yes.

32:30.810 --> 32:34.279
Didn't find Lips,
but uh, I found all them.

32:35.915 --> 32:37.382
Who else is with you?

32:38.383 --> 32:39.719
No one.

32:39.752 --> 32:41.386
That's what he said.

32:41.420 --> 32:44.590
She came looking for me.
I was alone.

32:45.357 --> 32:48.393
Look, we're not the bad guys.
If you'll just let us go...

32:48.427 --> 32:51.296
No, you'll tell the others
and they'll come.

32:53.165 --> 32:56.636
I won't let anything happen
to these kids.

33:08.915 --> 33:10.917
Janey, Janey.

33:10.950 --> 33:12.451
Janey.

33:12.484 --> 33:14.821
No, no.

33:14.854 --> 33:15.722
No.

33:16.421 --> 33:17.623
No!

33:20.292 --> 33:22.294
Janey!

33:31.904 --> 33:32.805
Hey, that's mine.

33:37.509 --> 33:39.578
You know,
it'd be easy to get outta here.

33:40.212 --> 33:42.682
I'll distract them
and you take Melanie out.

33:42.715 --> 33:46.585
I won't hurt her. She's trying to
take care of these little ones.

33:47.219 --> 33:49.822
She's batshit crazy
is what she is.

33:49.856 --> 33:52.925
I came across that boy and she popped
out of nowhere dressed like a rhino.

33:52.959 --> 33:54.459
She hit me with a bat.

33:55.227 --> 33:57.864
Oh, and don't call her Mel.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.265
Whatever the hell that's about.

34:02.501 --> 34:04.369
You know,
you should have waited for me.

34:04.871 --> 34:06.773
None of this would be happening.

34:07.740 --> 34:10.308
Yeah, well, here we are.

34:10.810 --> 34:12.712
Do you really have a dog?

34:13.913 --> 34:14.781
Yes.

34:15.882 --> 34:17.582
I was looking for him
when I found your brother.

34:17.984 --> 34:19.551
He's not my brother.

34:21.286 --> 34:23.422
What color is she? The dog?

34:24.389 --> 34:26.959
He is grayish with white spots.

34:27.994 --> 34:31.864
I used to have a dog. She was yellow.
Her name was Abbie.

34:32.999 --> 34:34.566
What's your dog's name?

34:36.435 --> 34:37.670
Lips.

34:38.370 --> 34:40.640
Lips, that's funny.

34:40.673 --> 34:43.710
I told you not to talk to them.

35:00.425 --> 35:03.930
Her name is Janey, my daughter.

35:06.364 --> 35:07.767
Have you seen that girl?

35:10.469 --> 35:14.807
I once saw a man turn to glop
after a nano-strike.

35:14.841 --> 35:16.843
Maddy, I told you not to talk.

35:16.876 --> 35:17.977
Well, I did.

35:19.812 --> 35:21.013
Glop, glop.

35:24.416 --> 35:25.417
Have you seen her?

35:26.384 --> 35:27.252
Please.

35:31.090 --> 35:34.694
There is a guy,
he collects kids.

35:37.429 --> 35:38.731
We got away from him.

35:41.033 --> 35:46.438
She could be there, but for her
sake, I hope she's not.

35:46.471 --> 35:47.640
Do you know his name?

35:48.607 --> 35:50.042
Do you know
where I can find him?

35:51.543 --> 35:55.480
We walked for weeks before we found
this place. So, I'm not really sure,

35:55.514 --> 35:58.918
but it's west,
towards the mountains.

35:59.886 --> 36:01.954
He goes by Jasper.

36:02.655 --> 36:07.627
He's a terrible person.

36:12.698 --> 36:13.565
Thank you.

36:14.499 --> 36:15.600
For what?

36:17.402 --> 36:18.303
Hope.

36:52.604 --> 36:54.640
I think we should do something
for them.

36:56.408 --> 36:57.076
Like what?

36:58.644 --> 37:01.446
They have food, shelter.

37:02.915 --> 37:04.784
Most importantly,
they have Melanie.

37:14.093 --> 37:15.761
Hold on, I'll be right back.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.055
Lips!

38:20.159 --> 38:22.061
See, I told you
he always comes back.

38:40.746 --> 38:42.514
Still need to get
your teeth fixed.

38:43.816 --> 38:46.484
You can forget about it
if it's with your boyfriend.

38:47.219 --> 38:48.654
He's not my boyfriend.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.124
Boyfriend.

38:52.825 --> 38:55.094
He's not my boyfriend.

38:56.262 --> 39:00.132
He sure is handsome and special.

39:00.800 --> 39:02.101
Don't make me shoot you.

39:03.436 --> 39:09.742
- You don't even have any bullets.
- Maybe I do, maybe I don't.

39:10.776 --> 39:11.811
Whatever.

39:31.330 --> 39:33.565
Okay, arms out.
Stand with your feet apart.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.668
Well, not so close to your face.

39:38.437 --> 39:42.574
Okay, line up the front sight
with the rear sight.

39:43.642 --> 39:45.144
And squeeze the trigger.

39:49.181 --> 39:51.684
Without any bullets,
this is pointless.

39:52.617 --> 39:56.022
Maybe. We only have six left.

39:56.055 --> 39:58.958
Just let me shoot one
to know what it feels like.

39:59.892 --> 40:01.293
I see your point.

40:08.634 --> 40:10.036
Arms straight out!

40:14.874 --> 40:15.741
No way.

40:16.909 --> 40:18.744
Oh, if I knew
that was all it took,

40:18.778 --> 40:19.945
we could have done that
a long time ago.

40:28.754 --> 40:29.621
How do you feel?

40:32.024 --> 40:33.692
Like something's missing.

40:34.693 --> 40:36.062
Like I got punched in the mouth.

40:38.230 --> 40:39.597
Must have cracked the cement.

40:46.305 --> 40:51.576
Emma, don't you ever just
wanna stay in one place?

40:52.244 --> 40:54.013
I don't know
how to stop looking.

40:56.949 --> 40:58.583
But thanks for sticking with me.

40:59.385 --> 41:01.020
Where else would I go?

41:04.790 --> 41:08.961
I don't know what hurts more,
my mouth or my feet.

41:09.361 --> 41:11.063
These boots don't fit anymore.

41:14.667 --> 41:16.302
We can get you some
better shoes.

41:17.736 --> 41:19.038
That we can do.

42:02.114 --> 42:05.784
Lips, get back.

42:13.926 --> 42:15.394
Strange.

42:15.427 --> 42:17.396
So, few around.

42:19.832 --> 42:20.799
Keep your eyes open.

42:35.147 --> 42:39.318
Scavengers, nearby.
The ones who follow him.

42:40.252 --> 42:42.721
- Follow who?
- Jasper.

42:44.290 --> 42:47.893
Emma, he knows Jasper.

42:59.305 --> 43:01.006
You should drop the backpack.

43:17.890 --> 43:19.358
Give me back my keys.

43:20.492 --> 43:23.762
- I gave you your stuff.
- Who's that guy back there?

43:23.796 --> 43:26.198
- He said something about Jasper.
- What?

43:26.865 --> 43:28.400
What did he say?

43:28.434 --> 43:30.903
Something about kids
scavenging for him.

43:32.571 --> 43:33.939
You know Jasper?

43:38.143 --> 43:43.449
Don't, don't, I need those.
I let people in and out.

43:43.482 --> 43:46.919
I lock things up.

43:48.020 --> 43:50.923
If I lose them,
he'll be real angry.

43:53.025 --> 43:53.892
Jasper?

44:01.433 --> 44:02.468
You got a name?

44:04.003 --> 44:05.037
Eli.

44:08.407 --> 44:09.408
Eli.

44:11.143 --> 44:13.178
You are going to introduce us
to Jasper.

44:16.015 --> 44:18.117
Jasper doesn't like strangers.

44:18.150 --> 44:19.318
Though, he might like him.

44:22.454 --> 44:24.823
Do you know a girl named Janey?

44:26.558 --> 44:28.327
I know a Janey.

44:30.863 --> 44:31.530
Is this her?

44:33.899 --> 44:36.235
Maybe. Janey's older now.

44:39.538 --> 44:43.275
Now, give me back my keys.

44:44.977 --> 44:48.414
Take us, then you can have
your keys back.

45:12.137 --> 45:13.505
Did Jasper do this?

45:14.340 --> 45:15.207
Sort of.

45:15.642 --> 45:16.975
Janey was there.

45:22.514 --> 45:23.382
Grab his shoes.

45:24.950 --> 45:26.285
The dead guy's shoes?

45:26.952 --> 45:28.487
Yeah, he doesn't need 'em.

45:31.557 --> 45:32.958
Just get 'em.

45:55.581 --> 45:58.317
You know, Jasper might
just decide to kill you.

45:58.984 --> 46:00.352
He's like that, you know?

46:02.020 --> 46:03.422
Why would you stay
with this guy?

46:04.256 --> 46:05.290
It's not so bad.

46:06.358 --> 46:10.229
We bring him stuff
and in return, he gives us food.

46:10.730 --> 46:12.398
You mean steal stuff?

46:13.298 --> 46:17.002
What, you mean you've never taken
something that wasn't yours?

46:17.035 --> 46:18.437
I just took your knife.

46:20.840 --> 46:22.307
You'll see how it is
soon enough.

46:23.275 --> 46:24.476
What's that supposed to mean?

46:27.079 --> 46:30.582
Hey, Eli,
what are we walking into here?

46:31.183 --> 46:32.351
Does he have guns?

46:33.519 --> 46:38.090
Some, but he doesn't need 'em.
You can still turn back.

46:38.557 --> 46:39.958
Just keep walking.

46:40.492 --> 46:41.393
I am walking.

46:42.094 --> 46:43.962
Can't you see that I'm walking?

47:01.246 --> 47:02.981
This is it.

47:04.082 --> 47:04.983
Can I have my keys now?

47:07.152 --> 47:08.020
Take us in.

47:09.154 --> 47:10.456
He'll be mad if he thinks
I brought a grownup in.

47:11.457 --> 47:12.692
You're gonna have
to go in alone.

47:13.459 --> 47:14.627
How do we manage that?

47:15.461 --> 47:18.330
Go to the gate,
make an offering.

47:19.465 --> 47:20.332
Him.

47:21.467 --> 47:23.602
Now, give me back my keys.

47:25.037 --> 47:25.705
Please.

47:26.338 --> 47:27.339
Give him his keys.

47:28.407 --> 47:29.541
An offering?

47:30.442 --> 47:31.678
What's that all about?

47:31.711 --> 47:33.345
This place is all kids.

47:34.179 --> 47:35.080
You're a kid.

47:36.114 --> 47:38.183
It's just the way he likes it.

47:38.217 --> 47:40.252
It's a good thing
that's not creepy.

47:41.353 --> 47:42.655
What about my knife?

48:04.510 --> 48:06.512
I don't see any stuff.

48:06.545 --> 48:08.046
So, now what?

48:08.080 --> 48:10.215
Let's just sit
and watch for a while.

48:30.269 --> 48:32.639
Do you really think Janey had
something to do with that guy?

48:33.338 --> 48:35.642
I don't know.
Maybe he had it coming.

48:39.779 --> 48:41.613
He just seemed like
a regular guy.

48:42.749 --> 48:44.416
Did you ever think
you'd kill someone?

48:46.786 --> 48:47.654
I guess not.

48:51.791 --> 48:53.793
Maybe you should just use me
to get us in.

48:54.459 --> 48:56.061
An offering or whatever.

48:57.429 --> 48:58.397
I don't like it.

48:58.430 --> 48:59.464
If it gets us in.

49:01.366 --> 49:04.269
So, what's the plan then?
You just gonna wait for an opening

49:04.303 --> 49:05.805
and storm the place
with five bullets and a hatchet?

49:06.505 --> 49:08.775
- Look, if something happened to you...
- Janey may be in there.

49:09.441 --> 49:12.144
We've been walking forever,
let's just play this out.

49:16.883 --> 49:18.317
You know I love you, right?

49:21.520 --> 49:22.387
Yeah.

49:28.393 --> 49:29.729
Let's stash our stuff here.

49:32.230 --> 49:35.200
- What about Lips?
- Let him roam.

49:36.268 --> 49:37.169
He'll be better off.

49:39.772 --> 49:40.707
Go on, Lips.

49:41.306 --> 49:42.174
Be safe.

50:01.560 --> 50:02.461
What do you want?

50:06.231 --> 50:09.234
- We need to speak to Jasper.
- Who are you talking to?

50:09.267 --> 50:10.803
Some lady and a boy.

50:11.436 --> 50:12.304
Let me see.

50:15.842 --> 50:17.710
How old is that boy?

50:17.744 --> 50:19.378
I'm 13.

50:20.612 --> 50:23.716
You can come in, but not her.

50:23.750 --> 50:24.684
Sorry.

50:25.584 --> 50:27.352
It's either both of us
or neither of us.

50:28.286 --> 50:29.656
Jasper will wanna see the boy.

50:29.689 --> 50:31.456
But not the grownup.
He'll be mad.

50:31.490 --> 50:32.792
He'll be mad
if he gets away too.

50:32.825 --> 50:34.393
I'm letting them in.

50:34.861 --> 50:37.396
Eli, open the gate.

50:44.469 --> 50:45.638
Got any weapons?

50:47.640 --> 50:48.675
I have a knife.

50:50.843 --> 50:51.911
Throw it over here.

50:54.881 --> 50:55.715
I want it, it's mine.

50:55.748 --> 50:57.650
It's mine, I'm giving it to him.

50:57.684 --> 50:58.785
No way, it's mine. Let me.

50:58.818 --> 51:00.218
I haven't given him
anything in a long time.

51:00.252 --> 51:01.420
Move!

51:04.456 --> 51:05.490
I'm taking it.

51:06.859 --> 51:08.661
I hate your stupid face.

51:08.695 --> 51:11.931
It doesn't matter.
We all get notches for giving him the boy.

51:11.964 --> 51:15.600
Okay, Jasper?

51:16.334 --> 51:18.470
Oh, yeah, follow me.

51:46.733 --> 51:47.767
Is he nice to you?

51:48.533 --> 51:49.401
Nice?

51:50.502 --> 51:51.671
No.

51:51.704 --> 51:55.240
Sometimes, but mostly not.

51:58.678 --> 51:59.812
Do you like it here?

52:01.047 --> 52:02.547
It's where we live.

52:45.624 --> 52:46.959
Are these for me?

52:46.993 --> 52:49.361
- I found them.
- You did not, we all did.

52:49.394 --> 52:50.362
Stop.

52:52.397 --> 52:54.399
Give each of yourselves
four notches in the book.

52:55.067 --> 52:57.469
- Me first.
- Why are you first?

52:57.502 --> 52:58.370
It doesn't matter.

52:58.403 --> 52:59.304
- I wanna go.
- Move it.

52:59.337 --> 53:00.405
- Stop, I'm going.
- Move!

53:00.438 --> 53:03.810
- You must be Jasper.
- You're always first.

53:03.843 --> 53:05.011
It doesn't matter. Stop!

53:05.044 --> 53:07.747
Just mark the book and get out.

53:30.703 --> 53:31.971
What the hell are you doing?

53:36.943 --> 53:39.411
I am Jasper.

53:42.648 --> 53:44.083
This is my home.

53:44.784 --> 53:49.554
Now, who are you
and what do you want?

53:51.190 --> 53:54.694
- I'm Emma and...
- Emma...

53:55.862 --> 53:56.996
And this is Sonny.

53:58.631 --> 54:02.367
Sonny, welcome, my child.

54:13.746 --> 54:15.715
We've been looking for you
for a long time.

54:15.748 --> 54:16.883
Really?

54:17.850 --> 54:19.986
How flattering, do tell.

54:20.953 --> 54:21.854
My daughter.

54:24.589 --> 54:29.629
I lost my daughter, she was taken from
me and since you know so many kids,

54:29.662 --> 54:32.865
I thought maybe you might know
where she's at.

54:32.899 --> 54:34.700
I don't know kids.

54:35.500 --> 54:36.936
I care for them.

54:37.904 --> 54:39.571
They are my family.

54:41.007 --> 54:41.941
Her name is Janey.

54:45.011 --> 54:47.412
What do you know?
I happen to know a Janey.

54:47.980 --> 54:48.981
Please, is she here?

54:52.184 --> 54:54.687
Probably just a coincidence.

54:57.589 --> 54:58.456
Janey!

55:00.259 --> 55:02.194
We've got visitors.

55:17.944 --> 55:19.444
Janey.

55:21.814 --> 55:22.915
Baby, I found you.

55:28.721 --> 55:30.122
Who said I was lost?

55:32.158 --> 55:33.059
Baby.

55:45.570 --> 55:46.238
Janey.

55:49.675 --> 55:50.676
It's me.

55:52.577 --> 55:54.046
What a touching moment.

55:55.214 --> 55:57.450
Aren't you happy
to see your mommy?

56:02.054 --> 56:02.922
Janey.

56:09.895 --> 56:11.529
What have you done to her?

56:12.597 --> 56:14.599
What have I done to her?

56:16.669 --> 56:17.837
I saved her.

56:18.603 --> 56:20.605
You took her from me.

56:20.639 --> 56:23.109
That is unkind and untrue.

56:23.876 --> 56:25.311
I never took anyone.

56:25.344 --> 56:26.846
Then let her go.

56:28.748 --> 56:29.815
Now!

56:29.849 --> 56:32.018
Of course.

56:36.588 --> 56:37.256
Baby.

56:39.058 --> 56:40.926
Come here.

56:44.997 --> 56:47.933
Janey, what's wrong with you?

56:47.967 --> 56:49.301
You left me.

56:49.335 --> 56:51.337
You left me!

56:51.370 --> 56:53.773
It sounds like you left her.

56:54.240 --> 56:56.675
No, I didn't.

56:57.710 --> 56:59.078
He took you from me.

56:59.111 --> 57:02.014
Again, with these accusations.

57:02.048 --> 57:04.616
Go on, honey, go to your mommy.

57:07.153 --> 57:08.254
I said, go!

57:12.224 --> 57:15.828
Now, show her the woman
you've become.

57:20.032 --> 57:22.234
Uh... What?

57:25.204 --> 57:27.907
Kids these days. I tell ya.

57:29.975 --> 57:31.844
What the hell is wrong with you?

57:32.378 --> 57:35.981
This is your mother.
We came all this way for you?

57:36.015 --> 57:39.952
Now, now, best to just stay out
of mother-daughter spats.

57:45.691 --> 57:46.725
Wanna be friends?

57:46.759 --> 57:48.661
No, I don't.

57:50.796 --> 57:52.765
Take him and explain the rules.

57:54.934 --> 57:56.068
Hey!

57:58.838 --> 58:02.074
- I'm gonna kill you...
- Oh, that time has passed.

58:02.108 --> 58:02.975
What are you doing?

58:05.344 --> 58:06.745
Hold still.

58:11.717 --> 58:14.753
I guess today is my day
to show you the ropes.

58:14.787 --> 58:17.289
Janey, stay close to your mom.

58:17.323 --> 58:20.025
Baby, I am so sorry.

58:21.060 --> 58:23.963
Please, hug me.

59:10.009 --> 59:11.210
What the fuck is your problem?

59:27.092 --> 59:29.128
When's the last time
you had a meal like this?

59:33.832 --> 59:35.834
Go on, eat up.

59:44.109 --> 59:46.078
There's plenty more
where that came from.

59:47.379 --> 59:51.250
- This doesn't change anything.
- It changes your hunger level.

59:53.819 --> 59:56.422
- So, what's the catch?
- No catch.

59:57.223 --> 59:59.225
You just have to earn it.

1:00:01.026 --> 1:00:02.394
Sounds like a catch.

1:00:05.364 --> 1:00:08.534
All you have to do
is dig around out there

1:00:08.567 --> 1:00:11.370
and find stuff
for mean old Jasper.

1:00:12.071 --> 1:00:13.372
Stuff?

1:00:13.405 --> 1:00:16.875
Food, electronics, weapons.

1:00:18.877 --> 1:00:19.979
I'll pass.

1:00:20.446 --> 1:00:21.347
No!

1:00:22.281 --> 1:00:23.482
It's not that bad.

1:00:23.515 --> 1:00:25.084
- No, please.
- We all have one.

1:00:25.117 --> 1:00:26.051
Stop moving!

1:00:27.586 --> 1:00:29.455
So, what's to stop me
from leaving?

1:00:29.488 --> 1:00:31.490
Emma, maybe.

1:00:33.559 --> 1:00:34.493
And this.

1:00:46.905 --> 1:00:48.007
You'll come around.

1:00:50.309 --> 1:00:51.310
They all do.

1:00:51.977 --> 1:00:53.112
No.

1:00:55.114 --> 1:00:57.549
- No!
- Is that kid coming around too?

1:01:01.420 --> 1:01:02.421
You betcha.

1:01:39.591 --> 1:01:40.459
Go.

1:01:53.238 --> 1:01:54.540
Don't look so sad.

1:01:56.508 --> 1:01:59.144
Your baby's alive after all.

1:02:02.014 --> 1:02:05.250
I'm not really sure
what I should do with you.

1:02:08.454 --> 1:02:09.555
Oh, good news.

1:02:11.323 --> 1:02:12.558
I got you a present.

1:02:16.228 --> 1:02:18.130
Here, put this on.

1:02:39.017 --> 1:02:39.885
You're welcome.

1:02:43.422 --> 1:02:44.523
What happened to her?

1:02:46.492 --> 1:02:47.627
Janey?

1:02:48.360 --> 1:02:51.130
You know, people change.

1:02:55.067 --> 1:02:55.934
It was you.

1:02:58.638 --> 1:02:59.538
You took her.

1:03:03.108 --> 1:03:05.611
Took her, no.

1:03:06.278 --> 1:03:07.446
I fed her.

1:03:08.213 --> 1:03:10.115
Taught her to defend herself.

1:03:11.517 --> 1:03:12.652
Where were you?

1:03:13.686 --> 1:03:15.320
I remember the tattoo.

1:03:22.528 --> 1:03:23.996
And I'm taking her with me.

1:03:26.098 --> 1:03:29.201
No, you're not.

1:03:33.539 --> 1:03:36.275
Every one of my kids are with me
because they wanna be.

1:03:36.743 --> 1:03:38.043
Look around.

1:03:39.111 --> 1:03:41.681
- They're better off with me.
- Then why just kids?

1:03:42.581 --> 1:03:44.249
They're our future.

1:03:44.283 --> 1:03:47.486
They bring the resources I need
to keep all this together.

1:03:48.721 --> 1:03:50.222
I'm just their advocate.

1:03:51.023 --> 1:03:53.559
Advocate?
That's what you're calling it?

1:03:55.093 --> 1:03:55.961
See this?

1:03:57.496 --> 1:04:00.399
I've been able to harness
my own little swarm.

1:04:01.066 --> 1:04:01.734
They're mine.

1:04:02.735 --> 1:04:04.771
This is why these kids are safe.

1:04:04.804 --> 1:04:07.306
This is why Janey is alive.

1:04:08.040 --> 1:04:10.042
You can't control those things.

1:04:11.310 --> 1:04:12.444
You're wrong.

1:04:12.478 --> 1:04:14.647
I know them,
I helped design them.

1:04:19.752 --> 1:04:21.721
Ever wonder what these
little guys look like?

1:04:23.555 --> 1:04:25.524
One is harmless.

1:04:27.326 --> 1:04:31.029
But as a swarm, they can devour
any biological material.

1:04:31.063 --> 1:04:33.165
Non biologics
pretty effectively, too.

1:04:33.198 --> 1:04:36.001
But, then,
you know that already.

1:04:41.607 --> 1:04:42.809
Not what you expected?

1:04:42.842 --> 1:04:45.577
Here, watch this.

1:04:47.780 --> 1:04:50.683
I don't have as much control
as the entity,

1:04:51.784 --> 1:04:54.486
but I can still do
all sorts of fun things.

1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:55.688
You're insane.

1:04:55.722 --> 1:04:58.123
No, I'm not.

1:05:42.601 --> 1:05:44.603
This makes you mine.

1:05:46.405 --> 1:05:48.507
Just like Janey is mine.

1:05:48.540 --> 1:05:51.678
And, of course, there's Sonny.

1:05:52.477 --> 1:05:54.313
Here, sit.

1:05:56.548 --> 1:05:58.517
You look like you need to sit.

1:06:02.187 --> 1:06:03.188
Okay.

1:06:04.523 --> 1:06:06.325
I'll give you some time
to regroup.

1:06:23.810 --> 1:06:24.711
Give me your hand.

1:06:25.778 --> 1:06:28.748
- What are you gonna propose?
- Give me your hand.

1:06:29.514 --> 1:06:32.618
You try to break this off,
it activates. You die.

1:06:33.953 --> 1:06:34.887
Now you're his dog.

1:06:36.421 --> 1:06:37.322
Like Lips?

1:06:40.827 --> 1:06:42.594
Oh, so you do remember your dog.

1:06:43.261 --> 1:06:44.229
Well, he's my dog now.

1:06:46.365 --> 1:06:48.701
Lips is still alive?
Where is he?

1:06:50.569 --> 1:06:51.436
Out there.

1:06:55.273 --> 1:06:57.810
You have no idea how long
we've been looking for you.

1:06:58.610 --> 1:07:01.346
The first thing you do is slap
your mother in the face.

1:07:01.714 --> 1:07:03.716
You don't know anything.

1:07:03.750 --> 1:07:05.350
I know what I saw.

1:07:06.686 --> 1:07:07.687
What's she to you?

1:07:08.655 --> 1:07:09.789
She's my friend.

1:07:09.822 --> 1:07:11.556
Your friend?

1:07:11.590 --> 1:07:13.926
Well, don't be surprised
when she abandons you.

1:07:16.428 --> 1:07:19.464
Show me the dog, dog.

1:07:21.433 --> 1:07:22.869
Eli, open the gate.

1:07:28.373 --> 1:07:30.877
- Better not hurt him.
- I'm not gonna hurt him.

1:07:30.910 --> 1:07:32.745
Did you leave him tied up?

1:07:33.578 --> 1:07:36.381
No, he stays near me and Emma.

1:07:36.949 --> 1:07:39.618
He hunts, he hides.

1:07:41.854 --> 1:07:42.889
Lips.

1:07:44.322 --> 1:07:45.658
Lips.

1:07:46.626 --> 1:07:47.827
He's around here somewhere.

1:07:48.695 --> 1:07:50.595
He hunts, really?

1:07:50.630 --> 1:07:52.230
Yeah, he does.

1:07:52.865 --> 1:07:54.399
Things change.

1:07:55.434 --> 1:07:57.937
Emma told me you named him Lips.

1:07:58.705 --> 1:07:59.571
How come?

1:08:00.807 --> 1:08:04.309
When he was a puppy, he used to
wake me up by licking my lips.

1:08:04.342 --> 1:08:05.645
The name stuck.

1:08:13.986 --> 1:08:16.421
Hey, those are ours.

1:08:17.589 --> 1:08:18.925
Were yours.

1:08:20.292 --> 1:08:22.628
Score, Jasper will like this.

1:08:24.496 --> 1:08:25.363
There he is.

1:08:27.900 --> 1:08:29.635
Lips, it's me, Janey.

1:08:34.473 --> 1:08:35.474
He's afraid of me.

1:08:35.507 --> 1:08:38.310
What do you know?
He doesn't like psychopaths.

1:08:40.545 --> 1:08:43.281
Lips, puppy,
wanna come home with me?

1:08:44.817 --> 1:08:46.318
Jasper don't like dogs.

1:08:47.519 --> 1:08:48.654
Unless they're in soup.

1:08:49.789 --> 1:08:51.991
Leave him out here.
He's better off.

1:08:52.024 --> 1:08:53.291
He's right.

1:08:53.926 --> 1:08:56.328
No, we're bringing him.
He's my dog.

1:08:56.361 --> 1:08:58.597
Actually,
he's sorta my dog now, but...

1:08:58.631 --> 1:09:00.532
No, he isn't.
He's coming with me.

1:09:01.366 --> 1:09:03.368
Really,
you should leave him out here.

1:09:03.870 --> 1:09:06.505
He stays near me and Emma.
You can come out and see him.

1:09:08.107 --> 1:09:09.307
Asshole.

1:09:22.822 --> 1:09:25.423
Jasper, look, I found an ax.

1:09:35.635 --> 1:09:37.569
Sorry, sorry.

1:09:43.676 --> 1:09:45.077
Lips, why are you here?

1:09:45.111 --> 1:09:46.879
I tried to leave him
out there, but...

1:09:46.913 --> 1:09:49.816
What is this?

1:09:49.849 --> 1:09:52.084
That's my dog
from when I was little.

1:09:52.118 --> 1:09:56.889
Janey, a dog in my space?
This is unacceptable.

1:09:57.657 --> 1:09:59.424
It's just a little dog.
I'll keep him away.

1:09:59.457 --> 1:10:00.960
Then why is it here now?

1:10:01.794 --> 1:10:03.461
My mistake, I'll take him away.

1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:09.702
Wait.

1:10:11.704 --> 1:10:15.741
Are you telling me that this is that
same little dog that you had years ago?

1:10:16.843 --> 1:10:17.743
Yes.

1:10:18.644 --> 1:10:19.679
No kidding.

1:10:20.880 --> 1:10:22.614
What are the chances?

1:10:25.051 --> 1:10:25.952
Bring it here.

1:10:25.985 --> 1:10:29.088
Please, he's my dog from before.

1:10:29.922 --> 1:10:33.092
Bring it here.

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:35.127
He's harmless.

1:10:35.795 --> 1:10:38.563
Do not make me say it again,
honey.

1:10:43.836 --> 1:10:45.872
Hello.

1:10:45.905 --> 1:10:50.142
Oh, this dog is barely a dog.

1:10:52.678 --> 1:10:55.882
It'd be more like eating
a pigeon, don't you think?

1:10:57.783 --> 1:10:58.751
Oh, come here.

1:11:00.152 --> 1:11:02.088
- Good boy, good boy...
- Please, Jasper, I'll do whatever you want.

1:11:17.103 --> 1:11:19.772
I told her we
should've left him outside.

1:11:29.148 --> 1:11:31.684
Janey, I'd back away
if I were you.

1:11:31.717 --> 1:11:34.552
- No, I won't.
- Oh, I think you will.

1:11:35.688 --> 1:11:37.924
It's just a mistake,
I'm bringing him back outside.

1:11:37.957 --> 1:11:39.959
Janey,
do not release that animal.

1:11:39.992 --> 1:11:42.862
- There's no reason to do this.
- Janey!

1:11:42.895 --> 1:11:45.530
Last chance.

1:11:47.565 --> 1:11:48.968
Baby, do what he says.

1:11:49.001 --> 1:11:50.169
It's Lips.

1:11:58.744 --> 1:12:00.179
Stop!

1:12:22.969 --> 1:12:25.738
- Stop! Make it stop.
- No. I'm sorry.

1:12:25.771 --> 1:12:28.040
Oh, Janey, it's not.

1:12:30.977 --> 1:12:32.812
No.

1:12:52.798 --> 1:12:54.566
- It's all my fault.
- It's not, it's not.

1:12:54.599 --> 1:12:58.104
- It's my fault. I'm sorry, mom.
- Oh, baby.

1:13:06.679 --> 1:13:08.647
How cool was that?

1:13:10.349 --> 1:13:12.685
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1:13:17.156 --> 1:13:19.258
I will, I will kill you.

1:13:19.291 --> 1:13:21.593
Oh, I highly doubt that.

1:13:22.361 --> 1:13:23.729
Get off of her!

1:13:28.067 --> 1:13:29.534
Leave her alone!

1:13:31.203 --> 1:13:33.005
She's my mother!

1:13:33.039 --> 1:13:39.078
Okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
Okay, Janey. Janey, okay.

1:13:39.111 --> 1:13:40.713
What?

1:13:40.746 --> 1:13:42.081
Did I cross a line?

1:13:43.649 --> 1:13:44.582
Okay.

1:13:45.785 --> 1:13:49.955
Listen, I'll forgive your
outburst and I won't kill her...

1:13:52.691 --> 1:13:55.027
...but she leaves now.

1:13:55.694 --> 1:13:57.930
- I'm not leaving without them.
- No?

1:13:58.764 --> 1:14:01.133
Okay, well, what about that,
huh?

1:14:02.101 --> 1:14:05.704
And what about Sonny? Hm?

1:14:06.338 --> 1:14:07.440
No? Okay.

1:14:07.473 --> 1:14:12.945
Okay, just stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop. Stop. Stop.

1:14:16.315 --> 1:14:18.250
I'll go.

1:14:18.284 --> 1:14:19.351
I'll go.

1:14:22.088 --> 1:14:24.156
But you have to leave them
alone.

1:14:26.425 --> 1:14:28.227
- Baby...
- No!

1:14:32.331 --> 1:14:33.899
Leave.

1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.368
Baby, be strong.

1:14:41.373 --> 1:14:42.308
This isn't over.

1:14:58.757 --> 1:15:00.392
Bye, bye, Emma.

1:15:03.429 --> 1:15:04.697
Oh, and, hey...

1:15:05.931 --> 1:15:13.072
If you come back, I liquefy
Sonny and then I liquefy you.

1:15:15.207 --> 1:15:16.075
Got it?

1:15:27.153 --> 1:15:29.355
Okay.

1:15:30.256 --> 1:15:36.795
Sonny, I'll forgive you
for the hatchet because of that.

1:15:38.297 --> 1:15:40.699
But you're gonna have
to make up for it.

1:15:44.770 --> 1:15:46.238
Clean up your dog.

1:15:47.206 --> 1:15:48.440
Fuck off!

1:15:49.275 --> 1:15:50.142
Huh.

1:15:53.012 --> 1:15:53.913
Okay.

1:15:55.347 --> 1:15:56.348
Eli.

1:15:58.350 --> 1:15:59.251
Eli!

1:16:00.486 --> 1:16:02.321
Get in here with a mop.

1:16:04.056 --> 1:16:05.157
Or maybe a shovel.

1:16:07.326 --> 1:16:09.762
You know what? Bring both.

1:17:41.387 --> 1:17:43.789
Hey, you shouldn't be here.

1:17:44.923 --> 1:17:46.358
What is this place?

1:17:47.293 --> 1:17:48.394
You need to leave.

1:17:52.331 --> 1:17:53.465
I got this.

1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:56.568
Can you read?

1:17:56.602 --> 1:17:58.437
Yeah, I can read.

1:17:58.470 --> 1:18:00.906
And you read the words
no trespassing?

1:18:03.175 --> 1:18:04.343
I must have missed that.

1:18:06.412 --> 1:18:10.282
Look, I just saw all these kids and
thought there might be some food around.

1:18:10.316 --> 1:18:13.185
Oh, I see, and you decided
to hop my fence.

1:18:13.218 --> 1:18:15.854
Sort of. I didn't mean no harm.

1:18:15.888 --> 1:18:18.290
You didn't mean any harm.

1:18:18.957 --> 1:18:19.858
Okay.

1:18:19.892 --> 1:18:22.127
Look, I'll just leave.

1:18:25.297 --> 1:18:26.498
Just wait one second.

1:18:30.969 --> 1:18:32.871
Oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no!

1:18:39.478 --> 1:18:40.546
Stop it!

1:18:53.058 --> 1:18:54.259
Scavenge.

1:20:53.445 --> 1:20:56.515
Do you ever think
about your life before?

1:20:58.584 --> 1:21:00.720
Sometimes, why?

1:21:01.487 --> 1:21:02.722
Just curious.

1:21:02.755 --> 1:21:04.256
What was it like?

1:21:04.289 --> 1:21:06.492
I lived in a palace
in the clouds.

1:21:11.631 --> 1:21:12.531
It was the suburb.

1:21:14.199 --> 1:21:18.671
I forget the name. House,
school, barbecues, sledding.

1:21:19.505 --> 1:21:22.174
It was nice. Safe.

1:21:24.644 --> 1:21:25.645
Brothers?

1:21:25.678 --> 1:21:27.012
Sisters?

1:21:27.613 --> 1:21:28.715
I had a little brother.

1:21:28.748 --> 1:21:30.549
Yeah, what was his name?

1:21:30.582 --> 1:21:33.418
Jacob, Jake.

1:21:34.754 --> 1:21:36.455
He used to really bug me.

1:21:38.423 --> 1:21:39.558
Parents?

1:21:39.591 --> 1:21:41.159
Had those too.

1:21:42.194 --> 1:21:43.462
What happened to them?

1:21:44.296 --> 1:21:45.597
What do you think
happened to them?

1:21:52.304 --> 1:21:53.205
Sonny, wait.

1:21:57.342 --> 1:21:58.745
I was just making
a conversation.

1:21:58.778 --> 1:22:00.780
I know, forget it.

1:22:03.683 --> 1:22:05.284
Let's leave some food for Emma.

1:22:06.385 --> 1:22:08.053
She's gonna get us killed.

1:22:09.521 --> 1:22:11.123
Did you not just see
what he did?

1:22:11.156 --> 1:22:12.659
Exactly my point.

1:22:12.692 --> 1:22:15.260
Emma's plan is reckless.

1:22:15.294 --> 1:22:18.798
I say we just keep bringing him stuff.
Maybe he'll get sick and die.

1:22:18.831 --> 1:22:20.599
It's a better plan,
it really is.

1:22:20.633 --> 1:22:22.234
He's not gonna stop.

1:22:22.702 --> 1:22:24.102
He likes being king.

1:22:27.306 --> 1:22:28.373
Let's go to her camp.

1:22:29.809 --> 1:22:31.243
One of us should head back.

1:22:31.778 --> 1:22:33.178
I'll see her another day.

1:22:34.881 --> 1:22:36.315
Don't go in the gate without me.

1:22:37.349 --> 1:22:38.216
Janey.

1:22:52.497 --> 1:22:53.432
Hey, handsome.

1:22:54.734 --> 1:22:56.168
You scared the hell out of me.

1:22:57.302 --> 1:22:59.104
You really need to be more aware
of your surroundings.

1:22:59.471 --> 1:23:01.841
I thought I was.
You just went all ninja on me.

1:23:02.909 --> 1:23:04.543
I brought you some stuff.

1:23:14.954 --> 1:23:18.423
This stuff will rot your teeth.

1:23:19.224 --> 1:23:24.396
Still with the teeth. You really
oughta let it go. Just have some soda.

1:23:27.967 --> 1:23:29.368
What happened to your leg?

1:23:29.936 --> 1:23:31.671
I cut it on some rebar.

1:23:32.672 --> 1:23:35.340
- How's Janey?
- She's okay.

1:23:35.908 --> 1:23:38.410
Still getting up in my face
about the plan.

1:23:43.215 --> 1:23:44.951
Is Jasper still bothering her?

1:23:44.984 --> 1:23:48.420
I don't think so.
He's been busy with his toys.

1:23:49.388 --> 1:23:50.622
I've been keeping an eye on her.

1:23:51.356 --> 1:23:53.893
- I bet you have.
- It's not like that.

1:23:53.926 --> 1:23:56.328
I'm just looking out for her
like you asked me to.

1:23:58.296 --> 1:23:59.899
Has he used his bugs recently?

1:24:01.834 --> 1:24:04.603
He just killed some guy for
wandering around the compound.

1:24:06.005 --> 1:24:07.472
Not with the swarm though.

1:24:09.374 --> 1:24:10.509
It was awful.

1:24:12.544 --> 1:24:16.381
I just need you and Janey and
those kids to be free of him.

1:24:16.916 --> 1:24:18.885
And then we'll all
be together, right?

1:24:18.918 --> 1:24:20.218
Yes.

1:24:22.655 --> 1:24:25.825
But promise me,
if anything happens,

1:24:26.425 --> 1:24:29.696
that you and Janey will stick
together, protect one another.

1:24:29.729 --> 1:24:32.197
I can't wait to see
the look on his face.

1:24:32.732 --> 1:24:34.232
Promise me.

1:24:34.266 --> 1:24:36.301
Emma, you don't know half
of all he does.

1:24:36.334 --> 1:24:38.905
- Say it.
- Fine, we'll stick together.

1:24:41.941 --> 1:24:42.809
Okay.

1:24:44.944 --> 1:24:45.812
Two days.

1:24:47.412 --> 1:24:48.648
Around noon.

1:24:49.982 --> 1:24:51.818
Look out for me
at the front gate.

1:24:54.286 --> 1:24:54.954
Okay.

1:25:06.833 --> 1:25:07.934
Was she there?

1:25:07.967 --> 1:25:10.903
Yeah, she wants to do it
in two days.

1:25:13.706 --> 1:25:15.440
This is gonna go bad.

1:25:28.654 --> 1:25:30.890
- Did you find any good stuff?
- Mind your own business.

1:25:30.923 --> 1:25:33.893
- This is my business.
- Oh, what, no dogs?

1:25:34.961 --> 1:25:36.929
What are you doing
hanging out with this loser?

1:25:37.697 --> 1:25:38.898
You should come by later.

1:25:39.732 --> 1:25:41.299
Hey, Eli, I was wondering.

1:25:42.702 --> 1:25:44.771
Is your ass jealous of all the
shit that comes out of your mouth?

1:25:45.671 --> 1:25:47.472
Very funny, fuckwit.

1:25:49.776 --> 1:25:51.978
- That was pretty good.
- I've been saving that one.

1:26:21.707 --> 1:26:25.878
For crying out loud, what is it?

1:26:26.545 --> 1:26:28.848
It's me and Sonny.

1:26:28.881 --> 1:26:30.549
We found some stuff.

1:26:30.582 --> 1:26:31.951
Your timing sucks.

1:26:35.721 --> 1:26:37.422
Okay, come in.

1:26:54.539 --> 1:26:55.975
Well, what did you bring me?

1:26:57.643 --> 1:26:59.712
Circuit boards, food.

1:26:59.745 --> 1:27:01.013
I found a wrench.

1:27:01.881 --> 1:27:04.750
You interrupted me for a wrench?

1:27:04.784 --> 1:27:07.987
There's food here too
and some blankets.

1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:10.488
Blankets, I don't need blankets.

1:27:11.556 --> 1:27:13.125
Give 'em to the little kids.

1:27:22.467 --> 1:27:24.036
Let me see those circuit boards.

1:27:28.540 --> 1:27:29.842
What's with the outfit?

1:27:29.876 --> 1:27:32.078
I went outside the fence,
it's practical.

1:27:32.845 --> 1:27:33.913
Practical?

1:27:36.916 --> 1:27:38.851
So, what,
are you two a pair now?

1:27:39.584 --> 1:27:42.788
We went salvaging together,
for you.

1:27:42.822 --> 1:27:43.856
Together.

1:27:55.935 --> 1:27:57.670
Just checking the power level.

1:28:05.711 --> 1:28:07.847
These, I can use.

1:28:07.880 --> 1:28:08.981
Nice work, Janey.

1:28:09.749 --> 1:28:12.985
See these? These are good.

1:28:14.654 --> 1:28:15.755
Let me see that wrench.

1:28:26.564 --> 1:28:28.000
Please.

1:28:42.715 --> 1:28:44.984
- Looks like it's malfunctioning.
- What?

1:28:45.885 --> 1:28:47.720
Then why am I still alive?

1:28:47.753 --> 1:28:51.556
They know the difference between
power drain and tampering.

1:28:51.589 --> 1:28:52.725
They know?

1:28:53.192 --> 1:28:56.162
I could have just left here
for good.

1:29:05.771 --> 1:29:08.473
You just don't get it, do you?

1:29:19.617 --> 1:29:24.924
I know you don't believe it
but you are safer here with me.

1:29:30.129 --> 1:29:31.596
I wanna talk to him alone.

1:29:39.672 --> 1:29:44.609
You need to make some
adjustments to your attitude.

1:29:44.643 --> 1:29:47.213
Gee, maniac dad,
thanks for the life lesson.

1:29:48.914 --> 1:29:51.684
This dynamic between us
really isn't working for me.

1:29:56.022 --> 1:29:58.556
Maybe I should give you
more responsibility.

1:30:00.793 --> 1:30:03.262
Jasper, how many people
have you killed?

1:30:03.996 --> 1:30:05.297
What did you say?

1:30:05.331 --> 1:30:06.766
I know of at least four.

1:30:08.100 --> 1:30:10.703
I'm just wondering how it is you
think I'm safer here with you.

1:30:11.804 --> 1:30:14.040
You, brazen little fuck.

1:30:15.775 --> 1:30:20.279
I should let you go. Let you get
slaughtered and eaten by some vagrant.

1:30:26.852 --> 1:30:28.521
You're still just a boy.

1:30:30.056 --> 1:30:32.258
Well, maybe I should just let
all the kids loose.

1:30:33.659 --> 1:30:35.761
See what happens, you know?

1:30:36.328 --> 1:30:37.763
We've had a pretty good run.

1:30:43.135 --> 1:30:44.937
But that's not who I am.

1:30:46.705 --> 1:30:52.878
Today, now,
is our new beginning, okay?

1:30:52.912 --> 1:30:55.948
And if not,
the question before us is,

1:30:55.981 --> 1:30:59.952
would the death of one mouthy
teen change anything?

1:31:04.390 --> 1:31:07.893
Now take your wrench
and get the fuck outta here.

1:31:42.027 --> 1:31:45.998
- You're hurt.
- I'll be okay.

1:31:46.465 --> 1:31:48.334
I can get you some
medical supplies.

1:31:49.101 --> 1:31:50.703
No, I don't wanna get you
in trouble.

1:31:50.736 --> 1:31:52.705
- It won't, I'll go get it.
- No.

1:31:53.239 --> 1:31:54.807
I don't want you to risk it.

1:32:00.246 --> 1:32:01.847
What did you do to your leg?

1:32:03.883 --> 1:32:05.251
It was a stupid mistake.

1:32:18.164 --> 1:32:20.199
Janey, I...

1:32:23.936 --> 1:32:25.237
I wanted to tell you.

1:32:27.873 --> 1:32:34.013
After you were taken,
I looked for you everywhere.

1:32:35.314 --> 1:32:36.115
Every day.

1:32:37.883 --> 1:32:40.019
I blame myself
for being unprepared.

1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:42.254
It wasn't your fault.

1:32:43.189 --> 1:32:44.323
It was Jasper.

1:32:45.124 --> 1:32:47.793
He lied and told me
it was your idea.

1:32:49.261 --> 1:32:52.765
Said that he could protect me
better, so you gave me up.

1:32:53.966 --> 1:32:58.137
I didn't wanna believe it
but I was little.

1:33:00.806 --> 1:33:03.242
I feel like I failed you.

1:33:06.345 --> 1:33:08.714
Can you ever forgive me?

1:33:09.348 --> 1:33:10.716
You're my mom.

1:33:12.918 --> 1:33:14.053
Of course, I forgive you.

1:33:31.403 --> 1:33:32.338
Thank you.

1:33:42.514 --> 1:33:44.850
I think he's been lying
about the bracelets.

1:33:45.317 --> 1:33:47.419
Mine was offline and the bugs
didn't come for me.

1:33:48.153 --> 1:33:50.189
Remember the kid
that tried to take his off?

1:33:50.222 --> 1:33:52.458
Yeah, but did you actually
see him mess with it?

1:33:53.225 --> 1:33:54.994
We just saw him afterwards.

1:33:55.027 --> 1:33:56.428
It's not worth the risk.

1:33:58.397 --> 1:34:00.499
Well, soon it won't be an issue.

1:34:03.969 --> 1:34:08.274
Hey, I wanted to say thanks,
for coming to save me back then.

1:34:08.307 --> 1:34:09.942
You didn't even know me.

1:34:09.975 --> 1:34:11.410
It was mostly Emma.

1:34:12.478 --> 1:34:14.046
I was just keeping her company.

1:34:14.513 --> 1:34:16.148
But you came just the same.

1:34:19.318 --> 1:34:20.319
She's here.

1:34:55.020 --> 1:34:56.288
Who is it?

1:34:56.322 --> 1:34:57.389
It's Janey.

1:34:58.090 --> 1:34:59.825
I'm in the middle of something.

1:35:11.170 --> 1:35:12.371
What is it?

1:35:13.172 --> 1:35:15.574
My mom, Emma, she's at the gate.

1:35:16.542 --> 1:35:18.177
Emma's here?

1:35:21.146 --> 1:35:24.116
Wow. The balls on her.

1:35:24.149 --> 1:35:25.451
What does she want?

1:35:25.484 --> 1:35:28.587
I don't know,
but please, don't hurt her.

1:35:28.620 --> 1:35:31.023
Ah, she knows the rules.

1:35:39.598 --> 1:35:42.201
Please let me talk to her.
I'll get her to leave.

1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:02.921
You shouldn't be here.

1:36:04.323 --> 1:36:05.557
I need to talk to him.

1:36:07.259 --> 1:36:08.293
I have something.

1:36:09.995 --> 1:36:11.063
A peace offering.

1:36:17.236 --> 1:36:19.071
Please, you need to leave.

1:36:21.206 --> 1:36:22.307
I have to talk to him.

1:36:27.747 --> 1:36:29.615
I thought I was clear.

1:36:31.550 --> 1:36:32.918
Yet here you are.

1:36:33.986 --> 1:36:35.187
I know.

1:36:40.025 --> 1:36:41.661
But I had to see my kids.

1:36:44.631 --> 1:36:49.101
You've broken the one rule.
You're here.

1:36:51.236 --> 1:36:52.639
I stayed away a long time.

1:36:55.407 --> 1:36:57.142
I brought something for you.

1:36:58.243 --> 1:36:59.344
Please.

1:37:21.266 --> 1:37:22.702
You know how this has to go.

1:38:07.847 --> 1:38:11.517
Janey, Janey, Janey.

1:38:11.550 --> 1:38:13.452
After all
that we've been through.

1:38:18.390 --> 1:38:19.726
They're coming now.

1:38:22.127 --> 1:38:23.630
Better say your goodbyes.

1:38:31.671 --> 1:38:34.206
Ah, they're gathering now.

1:38:35.107 --> 1:38:36.441
Seeking out their target.

1:38:47.185 --> 1:38:48.655
Janey, move!

1:38:51.123 --> 1:38:54.727
Huh. You little shit!

1:38:58.865 --> 1:39:04.403
No, no, no!

1:39:11.610 --> 1:39:14.613
No, no, no, no!

1:41:00.753 --> 1:41:01.754
You found her.

1:41:03.288 --> 1:41:03.956
We did.

1:41:05.590 --> 1:41:06.759
Jasper?

1:41:08.661 --> 1:41:09.594
He's gone.

1:41:11.596 --> 1:41:12.665
Good.

1:41:13.565 --> 1:41:15.233
Is it alright if we stay here?

1:41:15.968 --> 1:41:17.269
It's fine by me.

1:41:18.771 --> 1:41:20.205
Sure.
