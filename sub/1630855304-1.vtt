WEBVTT

02:00.245 --> 02:01.747
Oceanic 420, heavy.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.458
Any PIREPS on the
headwinds coming in?

02:11.423 --> 02:12.549
Roger that.

02:12.549 --> 02:15.093
97 minutes fuel time remaining.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.312
Ladies and gentlemen, this
is your captain speaking.

02:25.312 --> 02:27.231
Hope you've been enjoying
the flight up 'til now

02:27.231 --> 02:29.358
and managed to get a
little bit of sleep

02:29.358 --> 02:31.151
on this red eye to New York.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.778
We've got a slight headwind,

02:32.778 --> 02:35.322
which has really affected
our arrival time.

02:35.322 --> 02:36.907
Our wonderful flight attendants

02:36.907 --> 02:39.368
are doing one last
round of refreshments,

02:39.368 --> 02:42.955
and make sure you enjoy the
tail end of this flight.

02:42.955 --> 02:44.873
New York is a brisk 65,

02:44.873 --> 02:47.000
and if you look out
the windows as we land

02:47.000 --> 02:49.044
in a little over
an hour and a half

02:49.044 --> 02:51.296
you'll see the sun
rising over Manhattan.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.465
Sit back, enjoy the ride.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.467
The turbulence
should be minimal.

03:42.389 --> 03:43.348
He's got a gun!

03:43.348 --> 03:44.641
He's got a gun!

03:47.477 --> 03:48.395
Air marshal!

03:56.987 --> 03:58.530
Just calm down.

03:58.530 --> 04:00.324
Nobody has to get hurt.

04:31.647 --> 04:32.940
What happened?

04:32.940 --> 04:33.690
Get up!

04:45.202 --> 04:47.412
Get him outta here, come on!

04:51.041 --> 04:52.501
Come on.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.537
Yes.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.164
Chief, you better
come out here.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.592
Flight 420 and 30, last
track two niner five.

05:42.676 --> 05:43.427
Copy that.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.931
Steak-knife, come in.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.517
Steak-knife, please respond.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.769
Steak-knife, do you copy?

05:52.769 --> 05:54.646
- Over.
- Sit rep?

05:54.646 --> 05:57.399
Our 767 out of Heathrow
just pinged gold, chief.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.817
Transponders still tracking?

05:58.817 --> 05:59.776
Switched off.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.028
Radar track only.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.404
And our assets?

06:02.404 --> 06:03.655
No contact yet.

06:03.655 --> 06:05.699
Do we know their current fuel?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.660
77 minutes of
current reserves.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.246
Course 295, course 295.

06:11.246 --> 06:11.997
Copy?

06:13.832 --> 06:14.791
Toyin.

06:14.791 --> 06:15.959
Look sharp.

06:15.959 --> 06:18.170
The director's on his way now.

06:18.170 --> 06:19.713
How did he look?

06:19.713 --> 06:20.464
Pissed.

06:22.299 --> 06:23.759
What?

06:23.759 --> 06:25.385
The tin man's here.

06:27.471 --> 06:28.222
Great.

06:37.981 --> 06:39.399
Director Hawkins, I-

06:39.399 --> 06:40.984
Tell me about the bird, Toyin.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.695
Oceanic Flight 420,
out of Heathrow to JFK,

06:43.695 --> 06:47.533
dropped off the transponder
network at 04:11 hours.

06:47.533 --> 06:50.035
Confirmed multiple
armed hostiles on board.

06:50.035 --> 06:51.370
What about the failsafe?

06:51.370 --> 06:52.788
Disengaged locally.

06:52.788 --> 06:53.872
How
was it disengaged?

06:53.872 --> 06:55.415
We're not sure.

06:55.415 --> 06:57.417
Could have been damaged
during the takeover,

06:57.417 --> 06:59.503
or they figured out
how to disarm it.

06:59.503 --> 07:01.755
Without the failsafe,
auto pilot won't be able

07:01.755 --> 07:04.132
to realign the airplane
to a safe airport.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.844
So they can't
fly it and we can't fly it.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.847
No, the plane's
gonna crash, sir.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.265
Do we know how many hijackers?

07:11.265 --> 07:12.641
Five.

07:12.641 --> 07:13.976
Have we made
contact with them?

07:13.976 --> 07:15.477
Do they have any demands?

07:15.477 --> 07:17.062
Not with the hijackers, no,

07:17.062 --> 07:19.314
but we've been getting
intermittent signals

07:19.314 --> 07:21.275
from our asset on board.

07:22.192 --> 07:23.235
What asset?

07:45.841 --> 07:47.342
Come in.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.428
Steak-knife, can you copy?

08:22.753 --> 08:23.504
Shut up!

08:45.025 --> 08:46.485
Have you seen my dad?

08:46.485 --> 08:47.694
You're what?

08:47.694 --> 08:49.655
How the hell would I know?

08:49.655 --> 08:51.740
He's flying the plane.

08:51.740 --> 08:52.866
Son...

08:53.742 --> 08:54.493
Dad?

08:57.287 --> 08:58.038
Dad!

08:58.956 --> 09:00.290
Help him, please!

09:00.290 --> 09:01.375
Shit...

09:01.375 --> 09:03.001
Hey, stop doing that, kid.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.127
Stop, stop that.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.714
I need a med kit.

09:07.714 --> 09:09.049
Economy.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.217
In the back.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.134
Economy.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.344
In the back.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.304
What's he saying?
Dad.

09:14.304 --> 09:16.265
- What's your name?
- Samuel.

09:16.265 --> 09:17.975
Give me your hand.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.227
I need you to hold pressure
on your dad's neck here.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.563
Use both your hands.

09:22.563 --> 09:25.732
I'm gonna go find a med kit.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.943
Listen, don't let go, okay?

10:21.538 --> 10:22.289
Shit.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.375
Come in.

10:25.375 --> 10:26.335
Steak-knife.

10:35.219 --> 10:36.803
What are you looking for?

10:36.803 --> 10:37.721
Med kit.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.389
Pilot's been shot.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.892
Can I help you?

10:41.892 --> 10:42.643
Shut up!

10:46.021 --> 10:49.316
Find me someone, a
nurse, a doctor, anyone.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.609
Okay, go before they see you.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.362
I'll come and find you.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.531
We need someone
with medical training.

10:55.531 --> 10:56.823
Medical training.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.200
Anybody with medical training?

10:58.200 --> 10:59.701
A nurse, doctor...

10:59.701 --> 11:02.621
My God, I think
someone's been shot.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.998
They need a doctor.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.333
A nurse, doctor?

11:10.671 --> 11:11.839
Please.

11:11.839 --> 11:13.257
He's one of them.

11:15.217 --> 11:15.926
Please.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.389
Nobody move!

11:30.482 --> 11:32.150
Who is this asset?

11:32.150 --> 11:33.861
Deep cover operative.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.238
Works with our friends
across the pond.

11:36.238 --> 11:39.533
Implanted with the transnational
extremist cell in Ukraine

11:39.533 --> 11:40.784
late last year.

11:41.743 --> 11:43.412
Russian separatists.

11:43.412 --> 11:45.414
We don't know
their agenda yet.

11:45.414 --> 11:48.417
It seems we don't know
much of anything, do we?

11:48.417 --> 11:51.044
Well, we have a very weak
signal via satellite comm relay.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.671
Miniaturized
earpiece from DARPA.

11:52.671 --> 11:54.548
Why didn't our asset warn us?

11:54.548 --> 11:57.259
With all the intel we've been
getting on detainees lately,

11:57.259 --> 11:59.970
the current SOP
for these guys is,

11:59.970 --> 12:01.805
don't tell your people the plan

12:01.805 --> 12:03.974
until it's time for
them to know the plan.

12:03.974 --> 12:05.225
Best guess is--

12:05.225 --> 12:06.643
I don't want guesses, Toyin.

12:06.643 --> 12:08.145
I need intel.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.980
Play the last transmission.

12:09.980 --> 12:11.523
This is Steak-Knife.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.066
We have a hijack situation.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.401
Is Naznas waiting?

12:14.401 --> 12:16.361
I repeat, is Naznas waiting?

12:16.361 --> 12:17.905
Naznas.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.490
CIA picked that up
on their chatter too.

12:20.490 --> 12:21.783
All right, first
order of business.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.327
ID the hijackers.

12:23.327 --> 12:24.870
Get on the horn with
the asset's handler,

12:24.870 --> 12:26.955
find out everything you
can about the embed.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.374
Track every ground
and airline employee

12:29.374 --> 12:32.503
with access to that plane
to the last three ports.

12:32.503 --> 12:34.963
Second, we need
eyeballs on that plane.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.590
AWACS diverted onstation

12:36.590 --> 12:39.801
and F-22's ready for a
Code Orange scramble.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.513
I don't know who's that was,
but that's my office now.

12:42.513 --> 12:45.516
I need a secure line to the
White House, and a coffee.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.892
Black, no sugar.

12:48.685 --> 12:50.771
Director Hawkins.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.190
You're initiating a Code Orange?

12:53.190 --> 12:55.025
On whose authority?

12:55.025 --> 12:57.653
I think I just mentioned
the White House, didn't I?

12:57.653 --> 12:59.613
Sir, we have a
man on the inside.

12:59.613 --> 13:01.114
If we just give him time...

13:01.114 --> 13:02.616
Your comm link is down.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.493
Your asset is in
way over his head.

13:04.493 --> 13:07.746
You've got five armed
hostiles in control of a 767.

13:07.746 --> 13:10.290
I would say that our
opportunity vanished

13:10.290 --> 13:12.417
the moment that
failsafe was disabled.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.169
But this can't
be our first play.

13:14.169 --> 13:16.755
This is not the beginning
of some heroic story.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.424
In 10 minutes, our birds
will be in the air,

13:19.424 --> 13:20.968
and 20 minutes after that,

13:20.968 --> 13:23.053
they'll be in the
position to end this.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.639
And some innocent
people are going to die

13:25.639 --> 13:28.141
so that more innocent
people will live.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.537
RAD 21, please
confirm we are firing

13:48.537 --> 13:50.914
at passenger aircraft on sight.

13:50.914 --> 13:52.749
Confirmed, RAD 21.

13:52.749 --> 13:56.378
Rules of engagement are
FOS and weapons free.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.964
Locate and destroy flight.

13:58.964 --> 14:00.716
Copy that.

14:07.514 --> 14:09.474
Sam, move to the inside.

14:17.316 --> 14:19.067
I found us a doctor.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.738
They didn't see us leave.

14:41.673 --> 14:44.134
I saw three of
them down there.

14:44.134 --> 14:46.094
I saw two in the front.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.596
Is he gonna be okay?

14:47.596 --> 14:49.556
He's gonna be fine, Sam.

14:50.599 --> 14:52.518
Put your hand on this.

14:52.518 --> 14:54.061
Just get 'em round his side or
else we got a problem, okay?

14:54.061 --> 14:56.188
I'll get some some water.

14:56.188 --> 14:57.523
Allow me.

14:57.523 --> 14:59.483
I bandaged many
wounds in the war.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.780
Keep him alive.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.073
We'll need him.

15:59.001 --> 16:01.670
If he stops
breathing, call me.

16:02.880 --> 16:03.630
Only me.

16:17.936 --> 16:19.021
Steak-knife.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.439
Steak-knife, do you copy?

16:20.439 --> 16:22.691
Steak-knife, come in.

16:22.691 --> 16:23.859
Respond, please.

16:23.859 --> 16:25.485
We're running out of time.

16:25.485 --> 16:26.987
We need that link-up.

16:26.987 --> 16:28.447
I tried
every keyhole in range.

16:28.447 --> 16:29.865
He might be receiving,
he might not.

16:29.865 --> 16:30.991
What about the failsafe?

16:30.991 --> 16:32.618
Is there some way to re engage?

16:32.618 --> 16:34.286
Not if it's
a hardware issue, no.

16:34.286 --> 16:35.913
Okay.
Here we go.

16:37.039 --> 16:38.373
Okay, yes.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.083
What is it?

16:40.083 --> 16:41.627
I have a friend at the CIA

16:41.627 --> 16:43.295
who's been tracking all
this Naznas chatter.

16:43.295 --> 16:45.589
He found a thread on
the Ukrainian dark web.

16:45.589 --> 16:47.257
- This is bad.
- What?

16:47.257 --> 16:50.886
Naznas is a code for a
mass extermination event.

16:50.886 --> 16:53.680
This is some end of
days type shit here.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.641
I mean, if our hijackers
were actually messing around

16:55.641 --> 16:57.935
with something they're
calling Naznas,

16:57.935 --> 17:00.229
well, then, this is more
than just a hijacking.

17:00.229 --> 17:03.023
This whole thing is gonna
get a hell of a lot worse.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.484
Let's not let it get worse.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.366
What the fuck, Orca?

17:12.366 --> 17:14.618
You shot all the attendants.

17:14.618 --> 17:16.620
You could have brought
the plane down.

17:16.620 --> 17:18.997
Do not fire your weapon again.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.460
I take orders from
God, not from you.

17:23.460 --> 17:24.503
You don't like it?

17:24.503 --> 17:25.879
Get off my plane.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.342
You're fucking weak.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.139
You keep an eye on him.

17:36.139 --> 17:36.890
Agreed.

17:44.565 --> 17:46.108
Let's go.

17:46.108 --> 17:47.985
Who was that woman
with the pilot?

17:47.985 --> 17:48.986
She's a doctor.

17:48.986 --> 17:51.113
She's keeping him alive.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.197
You don't have control.

17:52.197 --> 17:53.699
Don't worry about that.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.200
You just keep an eye
on the passengers.

17:57.494 --> 17:59.246
Phone.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.414
Goran was supposed
to collect the phones!

18:00.414 --> 18:01.832
Whose fucking phone is it?

18:01.832 --> 18:04.126
Show me your phone.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.378
Give him your phones!

18:06.378 --> 18:08.213
Give him your phones!

18:17.973 --> 18:20.017
Give me the phone.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.063
Give me the phone.

18:34.156 --> 18:34.990
Good boy.

18:38.285 --> 18:40.245
What's going on?

18:41.496 --> 18:42.873
Shut the fuck up.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.124
Keep walking.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.334
Where are you taking me?

18:45.334 --> 18:46.335
Shut up.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.419
No, no no no!

18:47.419 --> 18:49.087
Shut the fuck up!

18:49.087 --> 18:52.049
No, no, no, no, no.

18:52.049 --> 18:53.133
Shut up!

18:53.133 --> 18:54.593
Do you know what this is?

18:54.593 --> 18:56.553
This is satellite communications.

18:56.553 --> 19:01.225
Do terrorists have satellites,
or do states have satellites?

19:01.225 --> 19:03.852
So what the fuck are you?

19:03.852 --> 19:05.187
I'm Interpol.

19:05.187 --> 19:06.772
What, like, undercover?

19:06.772 --> 19:08.857
Yeah, like, undercover.

19:10.192 --> 19:11.527
Oh, you're full of shit.

19:11.527 --> 19:13.195
Really?

19:13.362 --> 19:17.241
Then why haven't I put a bullet
in your fucking head yet?

19:24.665 --> 19:27.334
We need to involve
the other passengers.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.336
You do not blow my cover.

19:30.838 --> 19:32.047
You just did.

19:32.047 --> 19:33.507
You're one person.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.425
The more people know,

19:35.425 --> 19:38.220
the more likely the
hijackers will know.

19:38.220 --> 19:43.183
So, for both our fucking
sakes, keep it shut.

20:20.012 --> 20:21.763
I could use your help.

20:31.982 --> 20:33.442
Goran!

20:33.442 --> 20:34.985
Move!

21:14.107 --> 21:15.317
What is that?

21:17.027 --> 21:18.195
Nothing.

21:18.195 --> 21:19.905
It belonged to my son.

21:20.822 --> 21:22.115
Shrapnel?

21:22.115 --> 21:22.824
Yeah.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.913
How old was your son?

21:30.207 --> 21:32.501
We need to get to the pilot.

21:34.628 --> 21:35.379
Come on.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.842
What is that?

21:39.842 --> 21:40.968
Surveillance footage
of the flight maintenance

21:40.968 --> 21:42.594
on a fuel stop in Qatar.

21:42.594 --> 21:43.554
I have a friend there.

21:43.554 --> 21:44.847
Anything?

21:44.847 --> 21:46.139
Where's the Heathrow footage?

21:46.139 --> 21:47.474
Server crashed, sir.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.851
Before or after takeoff?

21:48.851 --> 21:50.394
20 minutes before.

21:50.394 --> 21:51.436
Tell me you don't
believe in coincidence.

21:51.436 --> 21:52.396
No, sir.

21:52.396 --> 21:54.147
Give me more, please.

22:23.302 --> 22:24.511
Fucking animal.

22:29.266 --> 22:30.976
Hey, you doing okay?

22:30.976 --> 22:32.311
Please stand back.

22:32.311 --> 22:33.896
Hey, I need you to
get me blankets,

22:33.896 --> 22:35.522
towels, anything we can
use as bandages, okay?

22:35.522 --> 22:36.481
Go.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.442
All right.

22:38.442 --> 22:39.902
Okay, Sammy, I'm gonna take
care of your daddy, all right?

22:39.902 --> 22:41.612
I need you to stay
really calm, okay?

22:41.612 --> 22:43.363
He's an undercover agent.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.282
He's gonna help us,
all right, sweetie?

22:45.282 --> 22:46.408
He's gonna save us.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.576
Don't you worry, okay?

22:47.576 --> 22:48.493
You stay calm.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.830
Hey, I got these.

22:51.830 --> 22:52.831
Okay.

22:52.831 --> 22:54.249
I told him about you.

22:54.249 --> 22:55.751
After I specifically
told you not to?

22:55.751 --> 22:57.377
Yeah.

22:57.377 --> 22:59.296
But we need the other
passengers, all right?

22:59.296 --> 23:01.006
Tell me this.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.133
When the doctor told you
that smoking causes cancer,

23:03.133 --> 23:04.676
did you start straight away

23:04.676 --> 23:06.220
or did you give it a
fucking day or two?

23:06.220 --> 23:07.679
I don't understand.

23:07.679 --> 23:09.223
The more people
know my identity,

23:09.223 --> 23:10.891
the worse it is for
your fucking health.

23:10.891 --> 23:13.352
Everything okay over there?

23:14.686 --> 23:17.105
Yeah, we're good.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.440
Aren't we good?

23:23.654 --> 23:25.405
Do your fucking job.

23:42.548 --> 23:44.049
Are you okay?

23:44.049 --> 23:44.800
Huh?

23:47.135 --> 23:48.554
Oh!

23:48.554 --> 23:49.930
Oh, yeah, yeah.

24:02.734 --> 24:05.654
How long have you
been a terrorist?

24:07.114 --> 24:08.782
You know what, Sam?

24:08.782 --> 24:12.828
I don't really consider
myself a terrorist.

24:12.828 --> 24:14.997
Then what are you?

24:16.748 --> 24:19.543
I'm just a man who's
about to get your father

24:19.543 --> 24:20.794
a glass of water.

25:20.020 --> 25:20.771
Shit.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.782
We're flying too high, too fast.

25:37.913 --> 25:39.081
Anan.

25:39.081 --> 25:40.290
What's happening?

25:40.290 --> 25:42.334
Where's the altimeter?

25:42.334 --> 25:43.126
30,000.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.920
It's steady.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.338
It's not rising.

25:46.338 --> 25:48.048
No, we're level.

25:48.048 --> 25:49.842
Cabin pressure.

25:49.842 --> 25:51.009
15 psi.

25:51.009 --> 25:52.386
We're over pressured.

25:52.386 --> 25:54.221
Normally, it's nine,
nine and a half.

25:54.221 --> 25:58.517
Goran's gun may have
punctured the fuselage.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.977
There's gotta be a problem

25:59.977 --> 26:01.812
with the cabin
pressurization system.

26:01.812 --> 26:03.146
It's rising.

26:03.146 --> 26:06.066
Past 17, the hull could rupture.

26:06.066 --> 26:08.819
How much time do I have?

26:08.819 --> 26:09.987
Five minutes.

26:09.987 --> 26:10.737
Shit.

26:16.034 --> 26:16.910
Hey.

26:17.995 --> 26:19.079
Wake him up.

26:19.079 --> 26:20.289
No, he's still unstable.

26:20.289 --> 26:21.957
Hey!

26:21.957 --> 26:22.875
I need the pilot to help
me fix the cabin pressure.

26:22.875 --> 26:24.459
He'll die.

26:24.459 --> 26:26.628
If you don't wake
him up, we'll all die.

26:26.628 --> 26:29.339
No, everything I've done
up until now is just basic.

26:29.339 --> 26:31.633
I can't be responsible for...

26:31.633 --> 26:32.718
Hey!

26:32.718 --> 26:34.803
You're not responsible.

26:34.803 --> 26:36.680
You didn't shoot him.

26:36.680 --> 26:37.639
Wake him up.

26:41.101 --> 26:42.936
It's gonna be okay, Sam.

26:44.438 --> 26:45.689
Hey.

26:45.689 --> 26:46.440
Sam...

26:49.193 --> 26:51.195
Where's your EpiPen, Sam?

26:51.195 --> 26:53.071
In the back.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.364
Meds, meds.

26:54.364 --> 26:55.782
Go get all the meds.

26:55.782 --> 26:56.533
Marko!

26:59.494 --> 27:01.079
Everybody, listen up.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.291
I need your medication now.

27:08.420 --> 27:10.088
We need meds.

27:10.088 --> 27:13.634
Asthma inhalers, EpiPens,
anything you've got.

27:15.177 --> 27:17.554
Come on, come on, come on!

27:29.316 --> 27:30.067
Okay.

27:41.787 --> 27:45.332
Hey, this is
everything they got.

27:52.047 --> 27:52.798
17 psi.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.093
Hey.

27:57.219 --> 27:59.680
Slow is smooth, smooth is fast.

28:00.722 --> 28:02.266
Too little Epi, he stays out.

28:02.266 --> 28:03.892
Too much, he codes.

28:03.892 --> 28:04.643
Relax.

28:18.240 --> 28:20.242
That's two.

28:20.242 --> 28:21.660
Nothing's happening.

28:21.660 --> 28:22.619
That's not enough.

28:22.619 --> 28:23.412
Just wait.

28:23.412 --> 28:24.580
He needs more.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.999
He could stroke out.

28:26.999 --> 28:27.749
Do it.

28:29.126 --> 28:30.669
No, wait. Please.

28:30.669 --> 28:33.005
Hey, Sam, Sam, look
at me, look at me!

28:33.005 --> 28:35.382
You've gotta trust her
to do her job right now.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.383
Okay?

28:36.383 --> 28:37.718
17.4 psi.

28:45.851 --> 28:46.602
Do it.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.942
17.6!

28:53.942 --> 28:55.485
Do it!

28:55.485 --> 28:56.236
Now!

28:59.156 --> 29:00.407
What's happening?

29:00.407 --> 29:01.491
Where am I?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.576
Hey, hey.

29:02.576 --> 29:04.286
The plane's been hijacked.

29:04.286 --> 29:06.496
A bullet has pierced
the hull somewhere.

29:06.496 --> 29:09.791
We're losing cabin pressure
and we're at 17 psi.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.919
How do I fix it?

29:11.919 --> 29:15.506
The valve must
be stuck in manual.

29:15.506 --> 29:17.549
Flip it to automatic.

29:17.549 --> 29:20.594
That will help
regulate the pressure.

29:22.179 --> 29:24.431
Where is the valve?

29:24.431 --> 29:25.265
Captain!

29:26.391 --> 29:27.351
What's happening?

29:27.351 --> 29:28.477
Inject him again.

29:28.477 --> 29:29.478
No, he'll stroke.

29:29.478 --> 29:30.979
We are out of time!

29:38.028 --> 29:42.449
Row seventeen, red
valve, blue conduit.

29:42.449 --> 29:43.492
Got it.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.494
Save my boy, please.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.578
Save my boy.

29:55.921 --> 29:56.672
17.8.

30:19.069 --> 30:19.820
17.9!

30:30.247 --> 30:30.998
18!

30:44.720 --> 30:46.430
17.8.

30:46.430 --> 30:47.764
16.

30:47.764 --> 30:49.016
14 and falling.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.662
You killed him.

31:11.622 --> 31:13.540
You killed him, you killed him,

31:13.540 --> 31:14.875
you killed him, you killed him!

31:14.875 --> 31:16.126
Hey.

31:55.082 --> 31:55.916
Sit down!

32:11.473 --> 32:12.224
Alex?

32:16.353 --> 32:18.605
You did everything you could.

32:22.150 --> 32:24.778
Let me see your hand.

32:24.778 --> 32:25.863
I'm good.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.614
Just give me your hand.

32:36.498 --> 32:38.709
You're wrong, you know.

32:38.709 --> 32:39.459
Am I?

32:40.961 --> 32:42.629
I quit everything.

32:43.881 --> 32:46.008
I quit my residency.

32:46.008 --> 32:48.552
I guess you had your reasons.

32:48.552 --> 32:49.303
Yeah.

32:50.137 --> 32:51.847
Yeah, shitty ex.

32:51.847 --> 32:53.932
He was a narcissist.

32:53.932 --> 32:56.602
Needed me to think that I
was worthless without him.

32:56.602 --> 32:58.353
And he was really
good, you know?

32:58.353 --> 33:00.814
Towards the end, I
almost did believe him.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.858
We fought a lot,
slept even less,

33:02.858 --> 33:05.903
and one day I administered
meds to a patient

33:05.903 --> 33:08.488
without checking their charts.

33:11.950 --> 33:15.120
Those were meds, they'd
already been given.

33:15.120 --> 33:17.289
And that's the day
that I quit my marriage

33:17.289 --> 33:18.707
and my residency.

33:21.043 --> 33:22.002
I'm sorry.

33:24.880 --> 33:25.964
Yeah, me, too.

33:31.845 --> 33:33.055
Seven.

33:33.055 --> 33:34.014
What?

33:35.641 --> 33:36.391
My son.

33:38.310 --> 33:39.394
He was seven.

33:47.819 --> 33:48.695
What now?

33:49.947 --> 33:50.906
We wait.

33:50.906 --> 33:52.157
No.

33:52.324 --> 33:55.285
We have to take
control of the plane.

34:00.666 --> 34:02.209
It looks like a toy.

34:04.086 --> 34:07.798
Yeah, it looks like a
toy, but it's not a toy.

34:10.509 --> 34:12.261
It's a 3D printed gun,

34:13.470 --> 34:14.930
basically the same
as a real one,

34:14.930 --> 34:16.974
with a two shot capacity.

34:18.892 --> 34:20.394
How does it work?

34:20.394 --> 34:24.147
Cock the hammer,
sensitive trigger.

34:27.651 --> 34:28.819
No magazine?

34:33.031 --> 34:33.866
Magazine.

34:39.955 --> 34:40.873
Point.

34:42.457 --> 34:43.208
And shoot.

34:48.005 --> 34:49.089
Got it?

34:49.089 --> 34:49.840
Yeah.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.634
Come on, Remy.

34:52.634 --> 34:55.179
The F22s are gonna be
on them any minute!

34:55.179 --> 34:56.096
I'm trying.

34:56.096 --> 34:57.681
Try harder, man!

35:06.148 --> 35:08.692
Steak-knife, come in.

35:12.362 --> 35:14.448
Do you have your man?

35:14.448 --> 35:16.950
This is Steak-knife.

35:16.950 --> 35:17.951
Yes, go on.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.495
The pilot's dead.

35:20.495 --> 35:22.915
There's no one to fly
the goddamn plane.

35:22.915 --> 35:25.250
What's the plan now?

35:25.250 --> 35:27.002
What do I tell him?

35:27.002 --> 35:29.129
There's no way to reestablish
the failsafe control

35:29.129 --> 35:30.547
from the ground?

35:30.547 --> 35:31.507
Not if there's
mechanical damage, no.

35:31.507 --> 35:33.342
Well, what about him?

35:33.342 --> 35:34.843
Can't we transfer a packet
that he can install locally,

35:34.843 --> 35:35.844
or something?

35:35.844 --> 35:36.970
Not at 30,000 feet.

35:36.970 --> 35:38.305
What's the ETA on the raptors?

35:38.305 --> 35:39.306
Six minutes, sir.

35:39.306 --> 35:40.224
Where are they now?

35:40.224 --> 35:41.808
Farm County, PA.

35:41.808 --> 35:43.227
You tell them we'll
have remote control

35:43.227 --> 35:45.229
of the failsafe
system in 10 minutes.

35:45.229 --> 35:47.105
Yes, sir.

35:47.105 --> 35:49.983
You want him to stand down
so the F22s can shoot him down.

35:49.983 --> 35:51.610
Sometimes you have
to put down your dog.

35:51.610 --> 35:53.111
Nobody wants to.

35:53.111 --> 35:54.863
But you're making
sure that happens.

35:54.863 --> 35:58.075
Look, if you have a
magic bullet, I'm all ears.

35:58.075 --> 35:58.825
If not...

36:04.248 --> 36:05.207
Roger.

36:05.207 --> 36:07.292
Roger, Steak-knife.

36:07.292 --> 36:09.086
Do not take any action.

36:09.086 --> 36:12.172
Ground control will regain
failsafe control remotely

36:12.172 --> 36:13.674
in 10 minutes.

36:13.674 --> 36:15.050
Good news?

36:16.260 --> 36:18.303
Not sure yet.

36:18.303 --> 36:20.472
You need to find somewhere
to sit down and buckle up.

36:20.472 --> 36:21.223
Go on.

36:28.230 --> 36:29.565
Sit the fuck down!

36:29.565 --> 36:30.941
Sit down, you!

36:30.941 --> 36:33.068
Hey, we need to do something.

36:33.068 --> 36:34.278
I don't know what.

36:34.278 --> 36:35.279
What do they want?

36:35.279 --> 36:36.989
I don't know.

36:36.989 --> 36:38.365
I say we make a stand.

36:46.999 --> 36:47.916
Sit, sit!

36:47.916 --> 36:49.084
Get the fuck down.

36:49.084 --> 36:50.919
You!

36:50.919 --> 36:53.297
Even if we overpower them,
who's gonna fly the plane?

36:53.297 --> 36:57.176
That lady saw the pilot
lying on the floor dead.

36:57.176 --> 36:59.261
We'll figure something out.

36:59.261 --> 37:01.263
It's time to make a move.

37:01.263 --> 37:03.265
Get back to your fucking seat.

37:03.265 --> 37:05.601
Get back to your fucking seat.

37:14.193 --> 37:16.320
Kim, I'm so scared.

37:16.320 --> 37:17.154
Ssh.

37:19.239 --> 37:20.782
Okay.

37:20.782 --> 37:23.285
All right, I need you to
stay inside here, okay?

37:23.285 --> 37:24.661
Be brave.

37:24.661 --> 37:27.456
Don't open the door
to anyone, okay?

37:27.456 --> 37:29.166
Do not open for anyone.

37:46.600 --> 37:48.101
Where's Goran?

37:48.101 --> 37:49.520
I'm not his
fucking babysitter.

37:49.520 --> 37:50.938
I haven't seen him.

37:59.154 --> 38:01.448
Orca, pick up the phone.

38:02.616 --> 38:03.951
Orca, pick up.

38:05.953 --> 38:07.996
Is Goran back there?

38:07.996 --> 38:09.122
No.

38:09.122 --> 38:10.415
Are you alone?

38:10.415 --> 38:11.458
No, I'm with Leika.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.960
Why, what's wrong?

38:12.960 --> 38:14.837
Alex is distracted
by the passengers.

38:14.837 --> 38:16.630
He's either losing
his way, or...

38:16.630 --> 38:17.714
What?

38:17.714 --> 38:19.508
Just find Goran.

38:19.508 --> 38:23.303
I've told you, you
trust Alex way too much.

38:28.600 --> 38:30.143
Overwatch,
it's RAD 21.

38:30.143 --> 38:32.187
Please confirm you're
fixed on target.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.689
Target is at 3-5-0,

38:33.689 --> 38:35.524
holding steady on
previous course.

38:35.524 --> 38:36.483
Copy that.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.360
We'll intercept at 4.5.

39:00.549 --> 39:02.676
We have to do something.

39:02.676 --> 39:04.011
Warn him.

39:04.011 --> 39:05.637
Yeah, but what
good will that do?

39:05.637 --> 39:08.932
Besides, any communication
will be monitored.

39:08.932 --> 39:09.725
Wait.

39:09.725 --> 39:10.684
What?

39:10.684 --> 39:11.518
Wait, wait, wait.

39:11.518 --> 39:12.477
Sigint.

39:12.477 --> 39:14.688
Signal interrupt.

39:14.688 --> 39:16.356
I can fire a white noise,

39:16.356 --> 39:18.066
then modulate the
connection to the satellite.

39:18.066 --> 39:19.610
On his end, it will
just cut in and out.

39:19.610 --> 39:20.652
Right?

39:20.652 --> 39:22.112
Like dots and dashes.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.655
Morse code.

39:23.655 --> 39:26.700
We could get in a hell
of a lot of trouble.

39:26.700 --> 39:27.910
Do it.

39:27.910 --> 39:28.869
All right.

39:45.719 --> 39:46.470
Shit.

40:46.113 --> 40:48.740
Rad 21
at eight-nine-niner.

40:48.740 --> 40:49.867
Target acquired.

40:52.286 --> 40:54.872
Tell him it's headed
to the starboard side,

40:54.872 --> 40:56.665
impact in 45 seconds.

40:56.665 --> 40:59.501
All right, 45 seconds.

41:19.354 --> 41:22.858
Sidewinder
is locked and loaded.

41:24.818 --> 41:26.528
On my mark.

41:26.528 --> 41:27.529
Two.

41:27.529 --> 41:28.530
One.

41:28.530 --> 41:29.239
Fire!

41:38.832 --> 41:41.168
What is it?

41:41.168 --> 41:42.002
What is it?

41:56.266 --> 41:57.684
Negative impact.

41:57.684 --> 41:58.435
Shit!

42:04.066 --> 42:06.235
Marko, come with me!

42:06.235 --> 42:08.278
What the fuck was that?

42:09.613 --> 42:11.865
What are you doing?

42:11.865 --> 42:14.243
Anan!

42:33.720 --> 42:37.850
Second strike
to launch, vector in range.

42:41.270 --> 42:42.437
Arming A to A.

43:09.047 --> 43:10.924
What was that?

43:10.924 --> 43:12.176
Unknown, sir.

43:20.058 --> 43:21.894
You motherfucker.

43:21.894 --> 43:22.853
What is it?

43:24.062 --> 43:25.022
Ghosts.

43:25.022 --> 43:26.023
Sir, I have ghosts.

43:26.023 --> 43:26.982
What the hell?

43:26.982 --> 43:28.233
Multiple phantoms.

43:28.233 --> 43:29.610
Must be HBTD.

43:29.610 --> 43:31.612
To confirm,
A985 frequency.

43:31.612 --> 43:32.529
Can't be.

43:32.529 --> 43:33.780
That's Russian.

43:33.780 --> 43:34.907
HBTD?

43:34.907 --> 43:36.575
High-band transmission device.

43:36.575 --> 43:39.077
Soviet bombers used them
to confuse American radar

43:39.077 --> 43:40.245
during the cold war.

43:40.245 --> 43:41.205
Radar is useless.

43:41.205 --> 43:42.206
We're flying blind!

43:42.206 --> 43:43.582
Friendly confirmed!

43:43.582 --> 43:45.209
Heavy out of Atlanta
in our airspace!

43:45.209 --> 43:46.919
Christ, we were supposed
to have clear air!

43:46.919 --> 43:49.505
Who gave them that
fucking clearance?

43:51.673 --> 43:56.345
Raptor 2 back in
formation for second launch.

44:04.228 --> 44:05.270
Goddamn it!

44:05.270 --> 44:06.230
Abort!

44:06.230 --> 44:07.773
Do what she says.

44:07.773 --> 44:09.399
Raptor abort!
Raptor abort!

44:09.399 --> 44:12.027
Negative, control.
Cannot abort.

44:25.666 --> 44:27.125
What the hell...

44:27.125 --> 44:28.669
It's gonna hit!

44:28.669 --> 44:29.837
I'm too close!

44:39.930 --> 44:40.681
Hey.

44:53.610 --> 44:56.697
That's
a direct hit, sir.

44:58.574 --> 44:59.783
Oh, my God!

44:59.783 --> 45:01.410
We're taking on debris!

45:16.508 --> 45:19.178
We lost the friendly.

45:19.178 --> 45:21.388
Raptor One, come in.

45:21.388 --> 45:23.265
Raptor Two, do you copy?

45:23.265 --> 45:25.434
Sir, we've lost both F22s.

45:27.728 --> 45:29.980
That's why we sent three.

45:35.402 --> 45:37.613
Raptor 3 engaged.

45:41.783 --> 45:42.576
Move!

45:42.576 --> 45:43.327
Move!

45:48.290 --> 45:50.334
She's in the clear.
Missile grazed it, sir.

45:50.334 --> 45:52.628
All right, let's get
them back on mission.

45:52.628 --> 45:53.420
What?

45:53.420 --> 45:54.880
No.

45:54.880 --> 45:56.757
No, you cannot go
through with this.

45:56.757 --> 45:59.301
We are shooting at
unarmed civilians

45:59.301 --> 46:01.261
in uncontrolled airspace.

46:01.261 --> 46:03.263
No, we're shooting
down a 200 ton missile

46:03.263 --> 46:05.265
that's gonna kill a lot
of unarmed civilians.

46:05.265 --> 46:06.850
This is war, chief.

46:06.850 --> 46:09.019
They started it and
we're responding.

46:09.019 --> 46:10.395
The order stands.

46:10.395 --> 46:11.855
Terminate on sight.

46:21.490 --> 46:22.533
What is that?

46:24.993 --> 46:26.995
That's an impact trigger.

46:26.995 --> 46:27.746
Yes.

46:29.122 --> 46:31.291
That's a nuclear warhead.

46:31.291 --> 46:33.085
What do you think
the Americans will do

46:33.085 --> 46:36.046
when a Russian nuclear
bomb destroys their city?

46:36.046 --> 46:39.216
How long will the world burn?

46:39.216 --> 46:43.470
You want to start a war
between the superpowers?

46:43.470 --> 46:44.888
No, Marko.

46:44.888 --> 46:47.224
I want a world
without superpowers.

46:47.224 --> 46:51.228
What we do today is the
beginning of their end.

47:00.237 --> 47:02.197
Asghar, pull up
the Qatar footage.

47:02.197 --> 47:05.951
And have our asset there
pick up the engineer.

47:13.584 --> 47:14.751
Wait a minute...

47:17.546 --> 47:20.465
Sir, I have something
you may want to see.

47:20.465 --> 47:21.925
All right, look here.

47:21.925 --> 47:23.552
This is the kit
trolley in Qatar,

47:23.552 --> 47:24.887
tarmac security in
the last three days.

47:24.887 --> 47:26.054
What do you see?

47:26.054 --> 47:27.556
They're loading the planes.

47:27.556 --> 47:29.516
Right, all 767s,
one load per plane.

47:29.516 --> 47:30.976
What's your point?

47:30.976 --> 47:33.145
Okay, so here's our 767.

47:34.313 --> 47:35.772
There are two crates.

47:35.772 --> 47:37.858
All right, now
look at the wheels.

47:37.858 --> 47:39.526
Before, and after.

47:39.526 --> 47:41.445
Now, that's carrying
some serious weight.

47:41.445 --> 47:43.488
Now how much do those
Russian scramblers weigh?

47:43.488 --> 47:45.199
20, 30 pounds.

47:45.199 --> 47:46.325
That engineer left more
than just a scrambler

47:46.325 --> 47:47.367
on that plane.

47:50.412 --> 47:52.206
Raptor
three is in position.

47:52.206 --> 47:54.374
I'm waiting for a go code.

47:55.834 --> 47:59.796
Sir, the raptor
is waiting on your go command.

47:59.796 --> 48:01.089
What is it?

48:01.089 --> 48:02.633
It could be anything.

48:02.633 --> 48:04.468
But, you think it's something.

48:04.468 --> 48:05.219
What?

48:07.054 --> 48:10.724
Sir, we don't believe
in coincidences, right?

48:12.684 --> 48:14.686
Back during the Cold War,

48:14.686 --> 48:17.314
the Soviets developed
a handful of low yield

48:17.314 --> 48:18.649
portable devices.

48:18.649 --> 48:20.442
Once the wall came down,

48:20.442 --> 48:22.694
almost half of them
disappeared overnight.

48:22.694 --> 48:24.029
Wait a second.

48:24.029 --> 48:25.155
Low yield?

48:25.155 --> 48:26.323
Sir, you're talking about--

48:26.323 --> 48:28.534
You're talking about nukes.

48:28.534 --> 48:30.577
Are we looking at
Russian involvement?

48:30.577 --> 48:33.705
No, it was smuggled
through Lithuania years ago,

48:33.705 --> 48:35.374
along with the scramblers.

48:35.374 --> 48:37.543
Division has been trying
to track them ever since.

48:37.543 --> 48:38.585
Jesus Christ.

48:38.585 --> 48:39.586
Naznas.

48:39.586 --> 48:40.963
A nuclear blast.

48:42.965 --> 48:44.800
Yes, go ahead.

48:44.800 --> 48:45.968
Uh-huh.

48:45.968 --> 48:47.594
Wait, this has been confirmed?

48:47.594 --> 48:48.595
What?

48:48.595 --> 48:50.389
Engineer's talking.

48:50.389 --> 48:54.643
Says there's a nuclear
device placed on that flight.

48:54.643 --> 48:56.270
Thank you.

48:56.270 --> 48:58.146
I need the SecDef on
the phone right away.

48:58.146 --> 48:59.189
Abort.

48:59.189 --> 49:00.732
Abort, abort.

49:00.732 --> 49:02.359
Abort.

49:02.359 --> 49:04.653
Mr. Secretary, we
have a situation here.

49:04.653 --> 49:07.990
I suggest we go to
Defcon Two immediately.

49:20.544 --> 49:21.712
Leika...

49:23.630 --> 49:24.882
Orca!

49:49.323 --> 49:51.742
Okay, so look, I got the
specs on one of these things.

49:51.742 --> 49:53.869
It's a fucking
nasty piece of work.

49:53.869 --> 49:55.370
See, look, here.

49:55.370 --> 49:56.914
It's fitted with an
impact detonator.

49:56.914 --> 49:58.498
So now we have to
shoot it out of the sky.

49:58.498 --> 49:59.875
There's no other choice.

49:59.875 --> 50:01.710
Nuclear explosion
at that altitude

50:01.710 --> 50:03.712
creates an EMP pulse that'll
knock the Eastern Seaboard

50:03.712 --> 50:05.214
back into the Stone Age.

50:05.214 --> 50:06.715
So, we can't shoot
it out of the sky,

50:06.715 --> 50:08.717
and the nuke goes
off when it crashes.

50:08.717 --> 50:09.551
Exactly.

50:09.551 --> 50:10.594
God damn...

50:11.929 --> 50:13.472
Sir.

50:13.472 --> 50:15.933
I have something I
think you should hear.

50:15.933 --> 50:19.102
We pulled this down off a
geostationary DMSP satcom

50:19.102 --> 50:21.188
about 20 minutes ago.

50:21.188 --> 50:25.984
It's a signal between Oceanic
402 and this facility.

50:43.836 --> 50:45.212
You got lucky.

50:45.212 --> 50:47.589
I did what I
thought was right.

50:47.589 --> 50:50.300
Who the fuck do
you think you are?

50:50.300 --> 50:53.887
We're not in some ethics
seminar at Harvard Law.

50:53.887 --> 50:56.473
We're not here to do
what we think is right.

50:56.473 --> 50:57.891
We're here to follow orders.

50:57.891 --> 50:59.852
You deliberately disobeyed me.

50:59.852 --> 51:01.019
And stopped a nuke from-

51:01.019 --> 51:02.354
Please don't interrupt me.

51:02.354 --> 51:03.856
The only reason
you're not wearing

51:03.856 --> 51:04.982
government issued
bracelets right now

51:04.982 --> 51:06.567
is because of that nuke.

51:06.567 --> 51:08.193
There's still a chance!

51:08.193 --> 51:09.570
How do you know?

51:09.570 --> 51:12.322
Because there's
always a chance!

51:14.157 --> 51:17.286
How many times have you
applied for the director's job,

51:17.286 --> 51:19.705
my job, and been rejected?

51:20.998 --> 51:21.790
Five.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.796
You still believe
there's a chance?

51:29.923 --> 51:32.301
Because you haven't lost.

51:32.301 --> 51:35.470
Because you haven't really lost.

51:35.470 --> 51:37.931
You haven't learned
how difficult

51:37.931 --> 51:41.018
the consequences of
indecision can be.

51:41.018 --> 51:44.062
You haven't had to make
a call on a sleeper cell,

51:44.062 --> 51:46.940
responsible for the
bombings of grade schools,

51:46.940 --> 51:49.651
only to have Washington
stand you down

51:49.651 --> 51:52.738
because they didn't
want to escalate.

51:54.072 --> 51:56.658
You didn't have to stay
up for two weeks straight

51:56.658 --> 51:59.077
because your daughter
was kidnapped

51:59.077 --> 52:03.624
by that same cell
that Washington told you not to touch.

52:05.250 --> 52:08.420
You didn't have to
watch her beheading

52:11.381 --> 52:12.758
on a livestream.

52:14.009 --> 52:14.968
I'm sorry.

52:19.890 --> 52:20.974
Luck runs out.

52:22.601 --> 52:24.394
And the only reason you
think there's still a chance

52:24.394 --> 52:28.440
is because you don't know
what the world really is.

52:30.275 --> 52:31.193
Maybe not.

52:33.820 --> 52:35.864
But I know what it can be.

52:39.952 --> 52:40.953
You can go.

53:11.567 --> 53:12.985
What do we do now?

53:12.985 --> 53:14.069
Listen to me.

53:14.069 --> 53:15.571
This is a suicide mission.

53:15.571 --> 53:17.114
They're using this
plane as a missile.

53:17.114 --> 53:18.740
We don't know that for sure.

53:18.740 --> 53:20.784
Our own government
tried to shoot us down.

53:20.784 --> 53:22.077
Nobody's coming.

53:22.077 --> 53:23.287
We're on our own.

53:29.710 --> 53:32.504
Heathrow finally came through
with the security footage.

53:32.504 --> 53:34.423
We're running face
analysis on it now.

53:34.423 --> 53:36.216
Where are we with
that comm link?

53:36.216 --> 53:38.594
Seven minutes until the
satellite's in range, sir.

53:38.594 --> 53:40.262
Let's stop bullshitting!

53:40.262 --> 53:42.598
Our guy needs a plan, and now.

53:44.057 --> 53:45.851
All right, just
take that back.

53:45.851 --> 53:46.894
It's no good.

53:48.270 --> 53:50.606
Go back and see what they say.

54:00.240 --> 54:00.991
Fuck!

54:12.920 --> 54:14.296
Shut the fuck up.

54:14.296 --> 54:15.547
Shut the fuck up.

54:17.382 --> 54:19.134
Let him go!

54:23.305 --> 54:24.056
Fuck!

55:08.517 --> 55:10.477
Give me the gun

55:13.856 --> 55:15.399
Stop fucking around.

55:32.624 --> 55:34.334
Let me ask you this.

55:36.753 --> 55:40.132
What is the greatest
struggle, my brother?

55:40.132 --> 55:43.594
To avenge the slaughter
of the innocents.

55:46.096 --> 55:50.058
What I am asking is a
more difficult question.

55:51.685 --> 55:55.355
The path that you were
on will not lead you

55:55.355 --> 55:57.608
to the peace you are seeking.

55:59.943 --> 56:03.989
Vengeance is both rational
and morally justifiable

56:03.989 --> 56:06.033
in the face of injustice.

56:07.409 --> 56:11.455
Prompted to my vengeance
by both heaven and hell.

56:13.040 --> 56:16.627
You missed the
moral of that story.

56:16.627 --> 56:19.755
Hamlet is blinded
by his revenge.

56:19.755 --> 56:22.799
It steers him down
a path of evil.

56:22.799 --> 56:25.886
His deeds inevitably
become worse and worse

56:25.886 --> 56:30.557
without him realizing the
gradual corruption of his soul.

56:32.100 --> 56:35.771
The struggle to forbid
the evil to mend the good,

56:37.272 --> 56:41.944
this battle, this is the
greatest struggle, my brother.

56:43.153 --> 56:45.030
The journey to
find the true way.

56:55.499 --> 56:57.501
You're not my brother.

57:18.272 --> 57:19.523
Remy.

57:19.523 --> 57:20.524
Jesus, Chief.

57:22.317 --> 57:24.903
I know how we can
reboot the failsafe.

57:24.903 --> 57:26.029
How?

57:26.029 --> 57:27.739
We reinstall it.

57:27.739 --> 57:29.199
What?

57:29.199 --> 57:30.534
The backup boot
is still up there

57:30.534 --> 57:32.286
on the main flight
control server.

57:32.286 --> 57:34.204
Now that the failsafe
has been disengaged,

57:34.204 --> 57:36.415
we can install the
package remotely.

57:36.415 --> 57:38.125
Yeah, but sir, we have
no way of transmitting

57:38.125 --> 57:39.668
the run code.

57:39.668 --> 57:40.794
The packet's way too big
for a commercial airline

57:40.794 --> 57:42.045
to receive it at that altitude.

57:42.045 --> 57:43.547
But not the raptor escort.

57:43.547 --> 57:45.841
They get mission
packages twice that size.

57:45.841 --> 57:48.010
What, you're saying the
raptor becomes a relay?

57:48.010 --> 57:49.428
Once you download the package,

57:49.428 --> 57:50.804
the install will
take care of itself,

57:50.804 --> 57:52.848
and we'll have a
fresh failsafe ready

57:52.848 --> 57:55.559
to accept the
default set up codes.

57:56.768 --> 57:59.771
Can you do this for me, Remy?

57:59.771 --> 58:01.356
Absolutely, sir.

58:07.529 --> 58:08.280
Goran!

58:14.953 --> 58:15.704
You.

58:16.663 --> 58:18.582
Get back to your seat.

58:25.172 --> 58:27.382
Can I
please have some water?

58:27.382 --> 58:28.300
Please!

58:28.300 --> 58:29.635
Shut up!

58:53.325 --> 58:55.911
Facial analysis just
finished the Heathrow footage.

58:55.911 --> 58:57.829
We got IDs on all but one.

59:03.877 --> 59:05.671
Slouris.

59:05.671 --> 59:07.422
Enid Slouris?

59:07.422 --> 59:09.550
Now we know where
they're headed.

59:09.550 --> 59:10.676
Where?

59:10.676 --> 59:12.261
Here.

59:12.261 --> 59:13.720
He's coming for me.

59:31.864 --> 59:33.907
Anan, what are you doing?

59:45.586 --> 59:48.839
Why is Slouris coming
here to kill you?

59:50.507 --> 59:53.552
Because history always
catches up with you.

59:53.552 --> 59:54.761
You knew him?

59:56.013 --> 59:59.349
I created him,
after my daughter.

59:59.349 --> 01:00:01.018
What did you do?

01:00:01.018 --> 01:00:03.854
I wanted to hurt as
many of them as I could.

01:00:03.854 --> 01:00:08.275
I didn't care what it cost
or who had to pay the price.

01:00:09.985 --> 01:00:12.487
The man most responsible
for Catarina's death,

01:00:12.487 --> 01:00:16.200
that's Enid's wife,
was named Abdul Hamas.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.118
He worked out ofa local market,

01:00:18.118 --> 01:00:22.122
using civilians in a nearby
village as human shields.

01:00:22.122 --> 01:00:23.790
He didn't think we would risk

01:00:23.790 --> 01:00:25.959
that kind of collateral damage,

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:28.128
but intelligence
didn't know about

01:00:28.128 --> 01:00:31.924
the ammonium nitrate
munitions depot.

01:00:31.924 --> 01:00:36.345
One of the boys in that school
was the son of Enid Slouris.

01:00:36.345 --> 01:00:37.429
After that...

01:00:39.932 --> 01:00:42.184
Slouris became a virus.

01:00:42.184 --> 01:00:45.020
He infects other extremist
terrorist groups,

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.856
he perverts their
supposed politics.

01:00:47.856 --> 01:00:50.150
He uses them for
his own purpose.

01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:52.319
Remember that attack in
Cape Town two years ago?

01:00:52.319 --> 01:00:53.862
Yeah, that was
Green September.

01:00:53.862 --> 01:00:56.198
That was Slouris
using Green September.

01:00:56.198 --> 01:00:59.910
And now he's on that
plane coming for you.

01:01:06.875 --> 01:01:08.544
I need to go to the cockpit.

01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:10.963
Did your friends get in touch?

01:01:10.963 --> 01:01:15.175
Just get the passengers
ready to roll on my signal.

01:01:44.997 --> 01:01:47.165
There's four of them
between us and the cockpit.

01:01:47.165 --> 01:01:48.250
Five.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:49.251
I know Alex is with us.

01:01:49.251 --> 01:01:50.836
He can fly the plane.

01:01:50.836 --> 01:01:51.962
That makes no sense,
he killed that guy.

01:01:51.962 --> 01:01:53.422
I don't have time to explain.

01:01:53.422 --> 01:01:54.548
You're just gonna
have to trust me.

01:01:54.548 --> 01:01:55.716
If we do nothing, we will die.

01:01:55.716 --> 01:01:57.259
We must take a stand together.

01:01:57.259 --> 01:01:58.510
I'm not doing anything
until we can prove that-

01:01:58.510 --> 01:02:00.262
You don't have a choice.

01:02:00.262 --> 01:02:02.973
He's the only one
who can help us.

01:02:37.216 --> 01:02:38.634
Shut up!

01:02:38.634 --> 01:02:41.053
What do you think you're doing?

01:02:41.053 --> 01:02:41.803
Shut up.

01:03:01.156 --> 01:03:04.117
Somebody has a plan and
we're taking over the plane.

01:03:10.249 --> 01:03:11.458
Orca!

01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:22.803
This is it!

01:03:44.908 --> 01:03:45.659
Again!

01:04:13.645 --> 01:04:16.398
We are with you, my brother.

01:04:19.610 --> 01:04:22.529
You are a traitor Alex!

01:04:22.529 --> 01:04:24.281
The traitor was Marco.

01:05:49.658 --> 01:05:50.409
Doctor.

01:05:51.618 --> 01:05:55.956
I think some of your
passengers may need your help.

01:05:56.915 --> 01:05:57.666
I'm good.

01:06:05.257 --> 01:06:07.968
Yeah, they're all down.

01:06:10.804 --> 01:06:12.764
Steak-knife,
can you hear me?

01:06:12.764 --> 01:06:13.932
Who is this?

01:06:15.017 --> 01:06:16.602
NSA Director Hawkins.

01:06:16.602 --> 01:06:20.105
Steak-knife, priority
one, enter the cockpit.

01:06:20.105 --> 01:06:21.481
Mr. Hawkins...

01:06:22.774 --> 01:06:23.525
Copy that.

01:06:28.155 --> 01:06:31.825
If anyone's wounded,
let yourself be known.

01:06:42.836 --> 01:06:45.797
Steak-knife, your F22 escort
is standing by to transmit

01:06:45.797 --> 01:06:48.509
the reset codes for
your failsafe system.

01:06:48.509 --> 01:06:50.177
What good does that do me?

01:06:50.177 --> 01:06:52.638
You'll automatically be
diverted to runway 2882,

01:06:52.638 --> 01:06:55.057
10 mile due South of
your current position.

01:06:55.057 --> 01:06:57.809
Once the failsafe is
restored, you'll have to reset

01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:01.855
the navigation breakers
under the center console.

01:07:03.106 --> 01:07:04.191
10 miles...

01:07:05.442 --> 01:07:07.486
We don't have enough fuel, sir.

01:07:07.486 --> 01:07:08.779
Yes, you do.

01:07:08.779 --> 01:07:10.614
There's still a chance.

01:07:16.703 --> 01:07:19.498
Can you really fly this thing?

01:07:20.791 --> 01:07:23.377
When I flip the switch
on these navigation busses,

01:07:23.377 --> 01:07:25.796
the control system
will lose power.

01:07:25.796 --> 01:07:27.798
And then what?

01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:28.674
Buckle up.

01:07:34.763 --> 01:07:36.640
I need everyone to buckle up!

01:07:44.273 --> 01:07:46.817
Antenna's online, sir.

01:07:46.817 --> 01:07:47.568
Yep.

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.237
Raptor 3, transmit.

01:07:50.237 --> 01:07:51.572
Roger, command.

01:07:51.572 --> 01:07:53.115
Transmitting packet.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.704
It's done, sir.

01:07:58.704 --> 01:08:00.455
Reset the breakers.

01:08:39.036 --> 01:08:40.579
Come on!

01:09:16.073 --> 01:09:17.449
You're mine now.

01:09:20.118 --> 01:09:21.954
Nice work, Steak-knife.

01:09:21.954 --> 01:09:24.039
Now, you need to input
the authorization code

01:09:24.039 --> 01:09:26.166
to give the failsafe control.

01:09:26.458 --> 01:09:30.963
The code is Tango
Oscar Sierra Mike

01:09:31.129 --> 01:09:34.925
Hotel Echo Lima Lima Five Four.

01:09:37.970 --> 01:09:40.764
Steak-knife, did
you copy my last?

01:09:41.682 --> 01:09:44.893
We can't engage the
system without the code.

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:06.248
I'm dead...

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:07.457
Dead.

01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:08.458
No.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:10.127
No, you're not dead.

01:10:10.127 --> 01:10:13.422
Are they dead?

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:14.548
The others?

01:10:16.049 --> 01:10:17.342
Yeah.

01:10:17.342 --> 01:10:19.178
They're all dead.

01:10:19.178 --> 01:10:23.640
Except for the undercover
agent that intercepted you.

01:10:27.603 --> 01:10:28.353
No...

01:10:29.605 --> 01:10:31.773
I'm the Interpol agent...

01:10:34.193 --> 01:10:34.943
What?

01:10:36.486 --> 01:10:39.531
Steak-knife,
I need to hear you.

01:10:39.531 --> 01:10:41.200
Use the code.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:46.038
Steak-knife, are you hearing me?

01:10:47.581 --> 01:10:50.250
Please confirm
you have the code.

01:11:09.144 --> 01:11:10.729
This is Steak-knife.

01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.689
Identification code
Alpha-Six-Three-Five.

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:14.733
Operation American City
infiltration is a ruse.

01:11:14.733 --> 01:11:16.443
Team's real mission
is hijacking.

01:11:16.443 --> 01:11:18.028
I repeat, hijacking.

01:11:18.028 --> 01:11:20.113
There are five armed
hijackers onboard.

01:11:20.113 --> 01:11:21.114
Do you copy?

01:11:21.114 --> 01:11:22.699
Everyone, stay calm.

01:11:22.699 --> 01:11:23.784
Move to the left of
the airplane, please.

01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:24.618
Now, ma'am.

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:45.264
Steak-knife,
can you hear me?

01:11:45.264 --> 01:11:47.474
Steak-knife, are you there?

01:11:48.433 --> 01:11:51.144
He never was, Mr. Hawkins.

01:12:03.156 --> 01:12:03.907
Slouris!

01:12:12.583 --> 01:12:14.084
Roll my sleeve.

01:12:19.882 --> 01:12:23.677
These are the access
codes to the cockpit door.

01:12:23.677 --> 01:12:25.262
You have to stop him.

01:12:25.262 --> 01:12:28.015
No, no, no, no, no, I can't...

01:12:29.266 --> 01:12:31.310
I can't fly the plane.

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:34.229
You can't let him
crash the plane.

01:12:34.229 --> 01:12:36.398
There's a nuke on board.

01:12:49.411 --> 01:12:50.704
No...

01:12:50.704 --> 01:12:51.455
No.

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.252
Okay, okay...

01:14:06.196 --> 01:14:06.947
No!

01:14:11.368 --> 01:14:12.119
No!

01:14:55.495 --> 01:14:57.247
I'll be with you soon.

01:15:07.382 --> 01:15:08.383
Stop!

01:15:08.383 --> 01:15:09.801
No, you lied to me!

01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:10.552
Just stop.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:16.058
Why did you kill
your own people?

01:15:16.058 --> 01:15:17.559
I had no choice.

01:15:18.810 --> 01:15:20.687
When they found the earpiece,

01:15:20.687 --> 01:15:23.732
I knew one of them was
an undercover agent.

01:15:23.732 --> 01:15:26.276
I just didn't know which one.

01:15:26.276 --> 01:15:28.153
I had to kill them all.

01:15:29.446 --> 01:15:30.656
I helped you...

01:15:32.783 --> 01:15:34.535
God, you...

01:15:34.535 --> 01:15:35.869
No.

01:15:35.869 --> 01:15:38.080
God has nothing to do with this.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.122
Then what, Alex?

01:15:39.122 --> 01:15:39.915
Why?

01:15:40.958 --> 01:15:41.708
Justice.

01:15:44.878 --> 01:15:47.631
So we all die
for your justice?

01:15:48.924 --> 01:15:50.509
Who dies for ours?

01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:52.886
When does it stop?

01:15:53.887 --> 01:15:55.389
It never stops.

01:15:56.849 --> 01:15:58.100
Give me the fucking...

01:16:02.688 --> 01:16:03.438
Fuck!

01:16:34.261 --> 01:16:35.762
You fucking shot me.

01:16:42.436 --> 01:16:43.687
Are you okay?

01:16:45.397 --> 01:16:46.565
Okay, come on.

01:16:48.942 --> 01:16:49.693
Okay...

01:16:54.865 --> 01:16:56.825
Are we gonna crash?

01:16:56.825 --> 01:16:58.827
We're gonna try not to.

01:16:58.827 --> 01:16:59.828
Hello?

01:16:59.828 --> 01:17:01.163
Hello, is anyone there?

01:17:01.163 --> 01:17:02.748
Can anyone hear me?

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:04.374
Someone's
on the pilot channel.

01:17:04.374 --> 01:17:05.584
Patch me in.

01:17:05.584 --> 01:17:06.960
Can anyone help me?

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:08.295
Identify yourself.

01:17:08.295 --> 01:17:10.005
My name is Kim.

01:17:10.005 --> 01:17:11.965
Okay, Kim, my name is Hawkins.

01:17:11.965 --> 01:17:14.051
Do you have control
of the plane?

01:17:14.051 --> 01:17:18.055
I guess so, but I
don't know how to fly.

01:17:18.055 --> 01:17:19.723
What about the hijackers?

01:17:19.723 --> 01:17:21.266
All down.

01:17:21.266 --> 01:17:23.143
Okay, I'm gonna
talk you through this.

01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:24.895
I want you to look at the
main console in front of you.

01:17:24.895 --> 01:17:26.271
Tell me what you see.

01:17:26.271 --> 01:17:27.648
Main console?

01:17:27.648 --> 01:17:28.815
It's right here.

01:17:28.815 --> 01:17:30.442
Here?

01:17:30.442 --> 01:17:31.944
Okay, it's asking for
an authorization code.

01:17:31.944 --> 01:17:34.947
Okay, type in the following.

01:17:34.947 --> 01:17:36.073
These inputs, Kim.

01:17:36.073 --> 01:17:36.907
Here, okay.

01:17:36.907 --> 01:17:37.908
Yeah, yeah, go.

01:17:37.908 --> 01:17:38.951
Tango.

01:17:38.951 --> 01:17:39.868
Tango.

01:17:39.868 --> 01:17:40.911
Oscar.
Oscar.

01:17:40.911 --> 01:17:41.954
- Mike.
- Mike.

01:17:41.954 --> 01:17:42.913
- Sierra.
- Sierra.

01:17:42.913 --> 01:17:44.373
- Hotel.
- Hotel.

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:45.999
- Echo.
- Echo.

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:47.543
Lima.

01:17:47.543 --> 01:17:48.585
Lima.

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:49.545
Five four.

01:17:49.545 --> 01:17:50.879
Five.

01:17:50.879 --> 01:17:51.630
Four.

01:17:55.008 --> 01:17:56.301
Everybody!

01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:57.886
Get ready to brace!

01:18:05.978 --> 01:18:07.521
Failsafe engaged.

01:18:07.521 --> 01:18:09.690
Rerouting to safe landing.

01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:15.320
ETA to landing site?

01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:16.905
10 minutes, Chief.

01:18:19.241 --> 01:18:20.784
All right.

01:18:20.784 --> 01:18:22.703
We don't have
enough fuel, Kim.

01:18:22.703 --> 01:18:23.787
Tell them.

01:18:23.787 --> 01:18:24.621
Hello?

01:18:24.621 --> 01:18:26.039
Hello?

01:18:26.039 --> 01:18:27.165
No!

01:18:27.165 --> 01:18:28.667
Hello?

01:18:28.667 --> 01:18:29.418
Kim?

01:18:30.252 --> 01:18:31.545
He's waking up!

01:18:37.009 --> 01:18:39.720
It's rerouting you to the
nearest automated runway.

01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:42.014
It's nine minutes away.

01:18:42.014 --> 01:18:43.682
You'll never make it.

01:18:45.267 --> 01:18:48.687
There's a private landing
strip a few miles away.

01:18:48.687 --> 01:18:50.480
You'll have to go manual.

01:18:50.480 --> 01:18:52.065
I can't do that!

01:18:52.065 --> 01:18:53.775
Yes, you can.

01:18:53.775 --> 01:18:56.028
I'll talk you through it.

01:18:56.028 --> 01:18:58.322
Two minutes ago you were
gonna crash this plane

01:18:58.322 --> 01:18:59.865
with all of us on it,

01:18:59.865 --> 01:19:02.242
and now you want to save us?

01:19:02.242 --> 01:19:02.993
Yes.

01:19:06.955 --> 01:19:08.707
We're running out of fuel.

01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:10.959
We're gonna lose an engine.

01:19:12.377 --> 01:19:13.587
Jump up, Sam.

01:19:13.587 --> 01:19:14.922
Jump up.

01:19:14.922 --> 01:19:15.672
Jump up!

01:19:16.548 --> 01:19:17.508
Good boy.

01:19:20.761 --> 01:19:24.223
If he tries anything,
you just shoot him.

01:19:36.276 --> 01:19:39.238
Sir, they've re-disabled
the failsafe override.

01:19:39.238 --> 01:19:43.200
We've lost autocontrol
of the plane.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:46.453
First, that's not
a steering wheel.

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:48.080
It's a yoke.

01:19:49.790 --> 01:19:53.043
Move left and right,
to roll the plane.

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:58.340
Push forward to pitch
the wheels down.

01:19:58.340 --> 01:20:01.093
Pull back to pitch
the nose back up.

01:20:02.553 --> 01:20:05.055
See those pedals by your foot?

01:20:05.055 --> 01:20:06.098
Yeah.

01:20:06.098 --> 01:20:07.516
That's your rudder.

01:20:07.516 --> 01:20:09.268
Now, using your left leg,

01:20:09.268 --> 01:20:13.355
turn us west until this
reads two-zero-two.

01:20:25.576 --> 01:20:26.785
Everybody!

01:20:26.785 --> 01:20:28.203
Get ready to brace!

01:20:30.330 --> 01:20:32.332
Target
veering off course.

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:33.458
Permission to fire.

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:34.334
Negative Raptor 31.

01:20:34.334 --> 01:20:35.836
Negative!

01:20:35.836 --> 01:20:38.297
There's a nuclear
bomb on that plane!

01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:54.229
Raptor
3 standing down.

01:20:56.523 --> 01:20:57.232
Ah.

01:20:59.484 --> 01:21:01.320
You did it, Kim.

01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:03.488
What's the name of that
airport they're headed for?

01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:07.117
Patcher Field,
about a mile off I-64.

01:21:07.117 --> 01:21:09.786
I want you to contact
local PD, fire, and rescue.

01:21:09.786 --> 01:21:11.496
We have to set a perimeter.

01:21:11.496 --> 01:21:14.499
Tell DOE, they need to move
in and secure that nuke

01:21:14.499 --> 01:21:17.377
the moment that plane
touches that runway.

01:21:17.377 --> 01:21:18.462
What's the local hospital?

01:21:18.462 --> 01:21:19.838
Jackson General.

01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:22.257
Tell them to expect incoming.

01:21:24.009 --> 01:21:26.845
Four red lights,
you're too low.

01:21:26.845 --> 01:21:29.890
Four white ones,
you're too high.

01:21:29.890 --> 01:21:33.602
Two red, two white will
get you to the runway.

01:21:38.065 --> 01:21:39.858
Now, you can't lower
the landing gear

01:21:39.858 --> 01:21:43.570
or the wind will
tear the wheels off.

01:21:43.570 --> 01:21:47.282
Use the throttle and
push back on the nose

01:21:47.282 --> 01:21:49.076
to bleed off more speed.

01:21:49.076 --> 01:21:49.826
Okay.

01:21:52.579 --> 01:21:54.456
Do you feel that?

01:21:54.456 --> 01:21:55.541
You feel that?

01:21:55.541 --> 01:21:56.583
That feels good.

01:21:56.583 --> 01:21:58.210
Feels good.

01:21:58.210 --> 01:22:01.338
Now, slow down the
throttle for the descent.

01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:07.594
That's good.

01:22:07.594 --> 01:22:09.304
Another second now.

01:22:09.304 --> 01:22:11.139
Another notch of flaps.

01:22:15.519 --> 01:22:16.353
Come on!

01:22:18.438 --> 01:22:19.147
Good.

01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:23.986
You're going slow enough
for the landing gear.

01:22:25.445 --> 01:22:26.780
Push this lever.

01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:28.115
- All the way down.
- This one?

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.074
That?

01:22:29.074 --> 01:22:30.450
All the way down!

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:34.705
Sam, come here!

01:22:34.705 --> 01:22:36.582
Samuel!

01:22:36.582 --> 01:22:39.710
When we pass over the fence,
I want you to cut the engine

01:22:39.710 --> 01:22:42.379
using these two buttons here.

01:22:42.379 --> 01:22:44.506
Then I want you to cut the fuel

01:22:44.506 --> 01:22:47.134
using this button here.

01:22:47.134 --> 01:22:49.094
You can't have
the engine running

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:52.306
in case anything bad happens.

01:22:52.306 --> 01:22:53.265
I trust you.

01:22:54.808 --> 01:22:57.186
Your dad would be
very proud of you.

01:22:57.186 --> 01:22:58.312
Yeah.

01:22:58.312 --> 01:22:59.438
That will work.

01:23:04.234 --> 01:23:05.235
Runway!

01:23:05.235 --> 01:23:06.486
Runway!

01:23:06.486 --> 01:23:07.946
Sam, cut the engines!

01:23:07.946 --> 01:23:09.198
But it's too low!

01:23:09.198 --> 01:23:10.449
Cut the fuel!

01:23:11.658 --> 01:23:12.659
Kim!

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.036
Keep her steady.

01:23:21.418 --> 01:23:22.252
Sam, brace!

01:24:32.823 --> 01:24:34.491
Plane is down.

01:24:34.491 --> 01:24:35.576
What?

01:24:35.576 --> 01:24:37.411
No detonation.

01:24:40.455 --> 01:24:41.206
Yes.

01:25:05.355 --> 01:25:07.191
Come on, we gotta go.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:10.611
Come on.

01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.427
Is that the fifth?

01:26:58.427 --> 01:26:59.928
Sixth, actually.

01:27:01.013 --> 01:27:02.639
Well, I wouldn't
worry about it.

01:27:02.639 --> 01:27:04.016
There's always the
chance the seventh

01:27:04.016 --> 01:27:05.893
will turn out differently.

01:27:05.893 --> 01:27:10.063
Isn't that right, Director
of Operations Toyin?

01:27:10.063 --> 01:27:11.231
Yes, sir.

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:13.734
Always a chance.

01:27:15.068 --> 01:27:17.196
Congratulations.

01:27:17.196 --> 01:27:18.113
And thank you.
