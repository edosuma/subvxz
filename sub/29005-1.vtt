01:07.198 --> 01:08.530
- Is that...
- Oh.

01:08.532 --> 01:10.899
- Oh, he's here.
- Huh?

01:14.105 --> 01:16.104
Oh, Bruce, is that you?

01:16.106 --> 01:17.506
I know, soon.

01:17.508 --> 01:19.509
Ah, this is a terrific space
for this.

01:19.511 --> 01:20.910
A moment.
I have to take this.

01:23.614 --> 01:25.348
I'm clear, Alfred. Update.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.949
<i>None as of yet.</i>

01:27.951 --> 01:32.088
Master Bruce, it is acceptable
to take one night off.

01:32.090 --> 01:34.657
Speak to someone about sports.

01:43.600 --> 01:45.568
Selina Kyle is here.

01:45.570 --> 01:49.738
<i>Perhaps Ms.
Kyle is merely enjoying the festivities.</i>

01:49.740 --> 01:52.574
She hasn't been involved
in any illegal activity

01:52.576 --> 01:54.976
for at least a year.

01:54.978 --> 01:56.244
Sixteen months.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.747
<i>Come on, it's Catwoman.</i>

02:02.553 --> 02:04.022
She's probably
casing the joint.

02:06.490 --> 02:07.923
One second.

02:13.798 --> 02:16.798
You were only supposed
to be scouting tonight.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.701
Sounds like it went sideways.

02:18.703 --> 02:19.704
Yeah.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.308
Found out the shipment was
tonight, so I thought I'd torch it.

02:27.877 --> 02:29.678
Who knew heroin
was so flammable?

02:33.984 --> 02:35.819
I'll be there in five.

02:35.821 --> 02:38.421
Five? Where's the trust?

02:39.524 --> 02:41.089
Huh?

02:41.091 --> 02:42.324
Aah!

02:44.195 --> 02:45.294
It's over in two.

02:49.034 --> 02:51.433
<i>Gotham PD is in,
so I'm out.</i>

02:52.937 --> 02:54.736
<i>Sir, do you have an idea</i>

02:54.738 --> 02:56.974
<i>what Ms. Kyle's interest
in the gala would be?</i>

03:00.978 --> 03:02.413
I'll ask.

03:11.389 --> 03:13.522
Well, knock me over
with a feather.

03:13.524 --> 03:15.724
Bruce Wayne mixing
with the swells.

03:15.726 --> 03:17.395
So what do
they owe the honor?

03:17.994 --> 03:19.427
It's mandatory.

03:19.429 --> 03:20.798
I'm a board member.

03:21.631 --> 03:23.665
How have you been, Selina?

03:23.667 --> 03:25.568
Anything new?

03:25.570 --> 03:27.572
You could say
I'm at a crossroads.

03:29.173 --> 03:30.575
I used to love my work

03:31.542 --> 03:33.107
at the gallery.

03:33.109 --> 03:34.409
But now...

03:34.411 --> 03:36.511
Sometimes change is good.

03:36.513 --> 03:38.248
Like you would know.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.182
Bruce?

03:40.184 --> 03:42.385
You're actually here.

03:42.387 --> 03:43.955
You never come
to these things.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.690
It's like seeing a unicorn

03:48.692 --> 03:50.695
in a $5,000 suit.

03:51.562 --> 03:53.494
Selina,

03:53.496 --> 03:56.766
this is Thomas Elliot, good friend
and world-renowned brain surgeon.

03:56.768 --> 03:59.502
Thomas, Selina Kyle.

03:59.504 --> 04:02.637
Hello. And I wouldn't say
"world-renowned."

04:02.639 --> 04:05.540
Maybe the US
and parts of Canada.

04:05.542 --> 04:07.776
Tom and I were inseparable
as kids,

04:07.778 --> 04:09.978
especially after
losing my parents.

04:09.980 --> 04:11.613
You're not getting away
this time.

04:11.615 --> 04:12.983
Come on, let's have a drink.

04:15.386 --> 04:17.055
Tony, line them up.

04:19.457 --> 04:21.991
<i>Sorry
to interrupt, Master Bruce,</i>

04:21.993 --> 04:26.294
but I'm receiving reports that
Bane has abducted a child.

04:26.296 --> 04:27.830
Ringing your phone now.

04:30.534 --> 04:32.568
This needs my attention.

04:32.570 --> 04:34.570
But it was good seeing you.

04:34.572 --> 04:36.107
I'd like to catch up.

04:36.841 --> 04:37.842
Soon.

04:45.248 --> 04:46.582
Nice while it lasted.

04:59.531 --> 05:01.833
And here we are.

05:06.671 --> 05:08.839
Seriously, both of them?

05:13.678 --> 05:15.779
Perfect couple.

05:30.462 --> 05:32.794
The scion of the Dupree Chemical fortune,

05:32.796 --> 05:38.000
eight-year-old Edward Dupree, has been
kidnapped by the criminal known as Bane.

05:38.002 --> 05:40.236
He has demanded
an undisclosed ransom,

05:40.238 --> 05:43.642
which the family has agreed
to pay, against police advice.

05:45.241 --> 05:47.775
Commissioner Gordon,
do you have a statement?

05:47.777 --> 05:50.178
Bane, if you're watching,

05:50.180 --> 05:53.084
we have your money.
Don't hurt the boy.

06:17.707 --> 06:21.979
<i>The child was taken
from the playground in broad daylight.</i>

06:30.488 --> 06:32.690
It's not like Bane
to be so public.

06:45.870 --> 06:47.872
Everything will
be fine, Edward.

06:49.106 --> 06:50.675
Where is he?

06:53.344 --> 06:56.277
Where's my damn money?

07:03.320 --> 07:07.690
Stupid old Bat,
my Venom is stronger.

07:07.692 --> 07:10.092
I am stronger!

07:17.969 --> 07:19.870
I need my money.

07:30.380 --> 07:33.649
I'll kill you!

07:33.651 --> 07:37.288
<i>Isn't Bane
usually a bit more eloquent?</i>

07:40.123 --> 07:42.892
It must be a side
effect of the new Venom design.

07:42.894 --> 07:45.361
Which means his mind
is under the same strain.

07:45.363 --> 07:48.897
Need my money
for more juice!

07:55.539 --> 07:57.472
Here's your money.

07:59.377 --> 08:00.377
Come get it.

08:21.666 --> 08:23.233
Your parents
are waiting in front.

08:28.305 --> 08:29.474
Asshole!

08:48.493 --> 08:49.493
Batman.

08:51.728 --> 08:53.464
Apologies for
the interruption.

08:54.232 --> 08:55.630
Lady Shiva.

08:55.632 --> 08:58.233
The League of Assassins
has no business here.

08:58.235 --> 09:00.035
Perhaps we do.

09:00.037 --> 09:02.169
The League has been in flux,

09:02.171 --> 09:04.441
different factions
vying for power.

09:05.675 --> 09:07.375
And?

09:07.377 --> 09:10.312
And in the chaos,
the life-giving power of a Lazarus Pit

09:10.314 --> 09:13.582
was exploited by
an unknown intruder.

09:13.584 --> 09:16.286
I would ask if you know
anything of this matter.

09:17.188 --> 09:19.020
No.

09:19.022 --> 09:20.423
But I'll look into it.

09:20.425 --> 09:22.658
Down here.

09:22.660 --> 09:24.358
My thanks.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.928
It was a pleasure
to see you work.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.800
Next time, call first.

09:37.307 --> 09:39.674
Is it too much to ask
for one quiet weekend?

09:39.676 --> 09:43.180
- Apparently.
- Well, thanks for saving the day, as usual.

09:43.946 --> 09:45.916
Wait, where's the ransom?

09:53.523 --> 09:54.558
Catwoman?

09:55.191 --> 09:57.024
Damn it!

09:57.026 --> 09:58.963
Did you know
she was back in town?

10:09.773 --> 10:11.075
Catwoman.

10:12.443 --> 10:13.812
Took you long enough.

10:34.397 --> 10:35.965
Like the view?

10:35.967 --> 10:38.036
It's the only thing
you'll catch tonight.

10:47.911 --> 10:49.379
Don't be so sure.

11:07.598 --> 11:08.599
No.

11:22.479 --> 11:24.081
Hush, Batman.

11:25.682 --> 11:27.117
Hush.

11:57.414 --> 11:59.246
Heh,
told you it was him.

11:59.248 --> 12:02.885
Fell out of the sky
like a dead pigeon.

12:04.688 --> 12:05.690
What the hell?

12:08.658 --> 12:11.395
Only one way to deal with this freak.

12:16.900 --> 12:18.467
Back off, boys.

12:18.469 --> 12:20.502
He's mine.

12:20.504 --> 12:23.438
How about we cut him in two,
and then you?

12:23.440 --> 12:26.074
After we're done with you,
he means.

12:26.076 --> 12:29.613
Naughty, naughty. There's a
three-strikes law in this state, boys.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.581
That was one.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.348
Two.

12:34.350 --> 12:35.953
Three.

12:36.420 --> 12:37.419
Ah!

12:37.421 --> 12:39.920
Ahh! Ooh!

12:39.922 --> 12:41.557
You know,
some guys pay for that.

12:57.108 --> 12:58.642
Man, screw this.

13:02.512 --> 13:03.580
That was...

13:05.114 --> 13:06.948
uncalled for.

13:06.950 --> 13:08.350
Get away from him.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.387
You're working with Bane
and you're going down.

13:11.222 --> 13:13.188
Calm yourself, little girl.

13:13.190 --> 13:15.790
Come quietly
and you won't get hurt.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.128
Aw, that's adorable.

13:29.739 --> 13:31.506
Take care of your boss.

13:32.943 --> 13:35.276
Ugh! He's not my boss.

13:41.417 --> 13:43.653
Alfred, Batman's hurt.

13:44.555 --> 13:45.687
Really hurt.

14:02.739 --> 14:04.307
Any problems?

14:06.076 --> 14:07.477
Batman.

14:09.079 --> 14:11.178
What happened?

14:11.180 --> 14:12.650
He couldn't keep up.

14:13.751 --> 14:15.683
You sound disappointed.

14:15.685 --> 14:17.151
Does it matter?

14:17.153 --> 14:19.754
I got the job done.

14:19.756 --> 14:23.824
Don't worry yourself
with anyone or anything,

14:23.826 --> 14:25.762
except pleasing me.

14:27.763 --> 14:29.366
Now bring me my money.

14:38.743 --> 14:40.078
Good Kitty.

14:40.944 --> 14:42.845
How would you say it?

14:42.847 --> 14:44.513
"Purrfect."

14:44.515 --> 14:47.982
Say it for me, Kitty. Say,

14:47.984 --> 14:49.486
"Purrfect."

14:51.122 --> 14:52.656
Purrfect.

14:55.124 --> 14:56.493
Mmm.

14:59.762 --> 15:01.232
You can go now.

15:14.911 --> 15:16.244
What the...

15:16.246 --> 15:18.746
Not yet, Ivy.

15:18.748 --> 15:21.949
Fifty-fifty, remember?

15:21.951 --> 15:24.186
Since I can't control you,

15:24.188 --> 15:27.389
maybe I'll finish our deal
another way.

15:27.391 --> 15:29.524
Oh, I wouldn't.

15:29.526 --> 15:34.196
If my vitals don't remain,
well, vital,

15:34.198 --> 15:39.570
this herbicide bomb will make
nasty work of you and your pets.

15:42.138 --> 15:45.140
But let's not go down
that road.

15:45.142 --> 15:49.544
I have a job that will pay
ten times what you made today.

15:49.546 --> 15:53.247
Think of all the fertilizer
you could buy.

15:53.249 --> 15:55.418
I even brought you a gift.

16:00.223 --> 16:03.461
Your favorite color,
I believe.

16:05.695 --> 16:07.861
Is he gonna be okay?

16:07.863 --> 16:11.298
His head injury
is beyond me, I'm afraid.

16:11.300 --> 16:13.034
He needs a hospital.

16:13.036 --> 16:15.102
Batman can go to the hospital?

16:15.104 --> 16:16.337
No.

16:16.339 --> 16:18.840
But reckless playboy
Bruce Wayne can.

16:18.842 --> 16:23.077
Take the roadster to Forest Road
near mile marker 82, and wreck it.

16:23.079 --> 16:25.313
Dick Grayson will take him
to the emergency room.

16:25.315 --> 16:29.116
Forty-five miles an hour
should be adequate.

16:29.118 --> 16:32.321
Remember to tuck and roll.

16:32.323 --> 16:34.257
Pretty screwed up
you guys have a plan for this.

16:35.459 --> 16:37.693
I shall notify Thomas Elliot.

16:37.695 --> 16:42.733
It seems Master Bruce will be spending
time with his old friend after all.

16:51.374 --> 16:55.212
Well, surgery couldn't
have gone better.

16:57.147 --> 17:00.414
But you'll have to stay out
of the fast lane for a while.

17:00.416 --> 17:02.384
Tom, I owe you so much.

17:02.386 --> 17:05.989
It's the least I can do for all
the times I left you hanging.

17:06.824 --> 17:08.358
Oh, wait.

17:09.959 --> 17:12.593
I know, I haven't been
a very good friend.

17:12.595 --> 17:14.461
Are you kidding me?

17:14.463 --> 17:17.165
Look at all the publicity
you gave me.

17:17.166 --> 17:20.435
And don't think you're the most
notorious patient I ever had.

17:20.436 --> 17:21.736
I get around, you know.

17:21.738 --> 17:24.471
You have patients
more infamous than me?

17:24.473 --> 17:26.943
You'd know if you
hung around me more.

17:28.178 --> 17:29.613
Maybe I will.

17:32.115 --> 17:34.315
I'm serious, Tom.

17:34.317 --> 17:36.985
I wanna be a better friend.

17:36.987 --> 17:41.389
Bruce, I will always
be your friend...

17:41.391 --> 17:43.827
no matter how annoying
that can be.

18:04.381 --> 18:08.783
Dr. Elliot recommended a minimum
of two more weeks bed rest.

18:08.785 --> 18:12.152
Can't be helped, I need to go
to Blackgate Prison.

18:12.154 --> 18:16.893
Yes, I see. I know better
than to try and dissuade you.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.795
By now, I would hope so.

18:20.797 --> 18:23.433
However, might I suggest
this one?

18:27.970 --> 18:31.273
The headpiece
has a bit more padding.

18:31.275 --> 18:34.578
- Hmm.
- Do try to avoid blows to the head.

18:36.180 --> 18:40.681
I'd prefer not to buttle for the
World's Greatest Vegetable, sir.

18:40.683 --> 18:43.421
Yes, very thoughtful, Alfred.

18:57.567 --> 18:59.399
Moving Bane
is unnecessary.

18:59.401 --> 19:02.670
Waller, this is one of the most
secure prisons on the planet.

19:02.672 --> 19:04.938
Security has nothing
to do with it.

19:04.940 --> 19:07.978
You have no paperwork, no orders.
I'm calling the mayor.

19:11.815 --> 19:13.718
Wondered when you'd get here.

19:15.619 --> 19:18.219
Are you also gonna tell me
I can't take him?

19:18.221 --> 19:21.221
Can't and shouldn't
are different things.

19:21.223 --> 19:23.091
I need to speak with Bane.

19:23.093 --> 19:24.659
Regarding?

19:24.661 --> 19:27.696
I believe he's working
with Poison Ivy and Catwoman.

19:27.698 --> 19:29.898
I need to know why.

19:29.900 --> 19:32.601
- Five minutes is all...
- No.

19:32.603 --> 19:34.669
I might have some information
to trade.

19:34.671 --> 19:36.704
I'm on a schedule.

19:36.706 --> 19:40.842
Another mission with your
so-called Suicide Squad?

19:44.047 --> 19:46.313
What's going on? Didn't you sedate him?

19:46.315 --> 19:49.317
<i>Yes, ma'am, enough to tranq
a herd of elephants.</i>

19:51.255 --> 19:55.426
Bane is using a new Venom.
Makes him immune to your sedatives.

19:57.126 --> 19:59.326
I was going to tell you.

19:59.328 --> 20:03.064
These tranquilizers can be fired from the
20 millimeter guns on your helicopters.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.669
Stay back and I'll help you
reacquire him.

20:07.571 --> 20:08.939
Batman.

20:10.340 --> 20:14.645
Stay out of my business
and I might stay out of yours.

20:32.062 --> 20:34.729
Where is my money?

20:34.731 --> 20:36.031
How should I know?

20:36.033 --> 20:39.234
Wrong answer.

20:39.236 --> 20:44.038
Listen, freak, Ivy was controlling
me, she made me steal your money.

20:44.040 --> 20:45.340
Hmm.

20:45.342 --> 20:47.941
Then you die first.

20:59.021 --> 21:00.857
Catwoman, down.

21:22.679 --> 21:25.516
The package is secure.
Move out.

21:33.690 --> 21:37.158
Thanks.
It appears we're even.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.893
Stay out of trouble.

21:38.895 --> 21:42.030
Wait, God, I know you're not
big on conversation,

21:42.032 --> 21:43.133
but hold on.

21:44.501 --> 21:46.769
You're going after Ivy
and I want in.

21:48.037 --> 21:49.871
I have a code.

21:49.873 --> 21:51.741
Revenge isn't part of it.

21:53.309 --> 21:58.278
How about the address of her
pheromone-controlled minions?

21:58.280 --> 22:02.350
Anyone knows where she went,
it's the zombies who tended her plants.

22:02.352 --> 22:05.589
Give me the information
and I'll take care of Ivy.

22:06.556 --> 22:08.489
Nope.

22:08.491 --> 22:11.793
Hmm. Fine,
we work together on this.

22:11.795 --> 22:13.093
What's the address?

22:13.095 --> 22:14.998
Oh, I'm not done
with my demands.

22:17.566 --> 22:21.037
Ticktock. Trail's going cold.

22:26.942 --> 22:29.710
We've done this dance
for so long.

22:29.712 --> 22:31.981
Aren't you just
the least bit...

22:33.249 --> 22:34.751
curious?

22:54.203 --> 22:56.371
No more.

22:56.373 --> 22:57.772
Metropolis.

22:57.774 --> 22:59.340
Ivy's in Metropolis.

22:59.342 --> 23:00.710
Hmm.

23:06.783 --> 23:09.152
God, you're hot
when you smash stuff.

23:11.388 --> 23:13.588
It's me. Get the jet ready.

23:13.590 --> 23:14.788
<i>Very good, sir.</i>

23:14.790 --> 23:16.690
And pack the jewelry.

23:16.692 --> 23:18.228
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

23:19.962 --> 23:21.097
Jewelry?

23:24.366 --> 23:27.701
"Man of Steel
Saves Bloodmobile."

23:27.703 --> 23:29.470
I like it.

23:29.472 --> 23:32.707
Hey, is "Man of Steel" hyphenated?
I can never remember.

23:32.709 --> 23:35.576
- Mmm, no.
- How about "Bloodmobile"?

23:35.578 --> 23:37.378
Lois, I have a deadline.

23:37.380 --> 23:41.482
Just super-type it like you do
when you think I'm not watching.

23:41.484 --> 23:45.053
How come you're still hanging around?
Don't you have an interview?

23:45.055 --> 23:48.089
He's coming here.
Quite the get.

23:48.091 --> 23:50.694
- Who?
- That would be me.

23:53.229 --> 23:54.897
Bruce, you're early.

23:56.732 --> 23:58.901
Bruce Wayne,
this is Clark Kent.

24:00.003 --> 24:01.703
I believe we've met.

24:01.705 --> 24:04.438
Yes. I've admired
your work, Clark.

24:04.440 --> 24:06.140
On occasion.

24:06.142 --> 24:08.911
Excuse me, got to check if
the conference room is ready.

24:10.646 --> 24:14.615
Something tells me a man like you
is here for more than an interview.

24:14.617 --> 24:17.150
I do like to multitask.

24:17.152 --> 24:19.419
Any business you can
tell me about?

24:19.421 --> 24:23.425
Not at the moment. Wouldn't want
any third parties getting involved.

24:23.427 --> 24:25.696
Ready.

24:26.229 --> 24:27.428
Shall we?

24:27.430 --> 24:30.096
I thought about buying
a newspaper once.

24:30.098 --> 24:32.367
Wouldn't it be something
if I owned the <i>Planet?</i>

24:32.369 --> 24:34.268
And you and Clark
could work for me.

24:34.270 --> 24:37.071
Just don't forget
my big raise, Mr. Moneybags.

24:37.073 --> 24:38.742
Lois.

24:53.390 --> 24:55.189
Oh, please.

24:55.191 --> 24:58.293
Don't tell me you and the Boy
Scout have switched cities.

24:58.295 --> 25:01.294
LexCorp makes
a fortified ethylene compound

25:01.296 --> 25:02.964
engineered to allow
exotic plants

25:02.966 --> 25:06.033
to withstand changes
in locale and temperature.

25:06.035 --> 25:09.603
And, so, why are you here?

25:09.605 --> 25:13.006
I need the delivery list of
that compound for the last week.

25:13.008 --> 25:16.710
So, of course you come to me
at 3:00 in the morning.

25:16.712 --> 25:20.750
The sooner I have the information,
the sooner you get back to sleep.

25:22.286 --> 25:24.886
And you couldn't visit the
person who does the deliveries

25:24.888 --> 25:28.422
and is probably awake
as we speak?

25:28.424 --> 25:30.557
The information was deleted
on her computer.

25:30.559 --> 25:33.062
I assume yours has
a few more safeguards.

25:33.663 --> 25:35.031
One or two.

25:38.568 --> 25:39.769
Here.

25:45.507 --> 25:50.078
Would you like a printout,
maybe some hot cocoa before you leave?

25:50.080 --> 25:51.580
I have what I need.

25:51.582 --> 25:55.015
What you need is to show me
some respect.

25:55.017 --> 25:58.052
I saved all your asses
against Cyborg Superman,

25:58.054 --> 26:01.488
and I'll remind you I'm
a Justice League member now.

26:01.490 --> 26:05.962
Probationary member.
Don't call us, we'll call you.

26:13.169 --> 26:15.236
Well, look who's here.

26:15.238 --> 26:17.138
Wondered when you'd find me.

26:17.140 --> 26:18.876
I've come back to you.

26:19.843 --> 26:21.277
Have you, now?

26:24.747 --> 26:26.982
No one can resist you.

26:26.984 --> 26:29.019
And why would they want to?

26:30.486 --> 26:32.523
That's so true, Kitty.

26:34.123 --> 26:36.459
But no one fakes it with me.

26:39.796 --> 26:42.763
Okay, crazy plant bitch,
it's on.

26:55.077 --> 26:57.879
Nose filters?

26:57.881 --> 27:00.849
What am I going
to do with you, Kitty?

27:00.851 --> 27:03.020
Oh, I know.

27:14.064 --> 27:16.166
Cut it close, why don't you.

27:18.101 --> 27:20.467
You're going back
to Arkham, Ivy.

27:20.469 --> 27:21.570
Oh!

27:21.572 --> 27:23.841
Is Batman your new boy toy?

27:29.379 --> 27:30.981
I have one, too.

27:32.848 --> 27:34.617
Stay away from her.

27:36.052 --> 27:38.753
You heard my Superman.

27:38.755 --> 27:39.957
Lover...

27:41.056 --> 27:42.258
kill them.

27:45.428 --> 27:47.828
- Tell me you have a plan.
- Yes.

27:47.830 --> 27:49.032
Run.

28:19.094 --> 28:22.463
You thoughtless, worthless,
stupid meat.

28:22.465 --> 28:25.035
I don't get my money
if they're still alive.

28:25.969 --> 28:28.337
I won't... kill.

28:29.305 --> 28:32.105
Are you trying to resist?

28:32.107 --> 28:34.977
Seems my kryptonite kisses
need a touch-up.

28:37.814 --> 28:39.283
Mmm.

28:42.617 --> 28:44.351
Find them.

28:44.353 --> 28:45.555
Kill them.

28:46.021 --> 28:47.121
Yes.

28:50.258 --> 28:52.562
Ugh, help these days.

28:53.996 --> 28:55.330
How is he not on us?

28:55.332 --> 28:57.599
He's as fast as a...
Well, you know.

28:57.601 --> 28:59.536
Lead-lined tunnels,
courtesy of LexCorp.

29:02.337 --> 29:03.639
They'll buy us some time.

29:04.340 --> 29:06.174
But this is Superman.

29:06.176 --> 29:09.179
Yes, and if he wanted,
we'd be dead already.

29:10.713 --> 29:12.447
Deep down, he's a good person.

29:12.449 --> 29:13.683
And deep down...

29:14.851 --> 29:16.784
I'm not.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.120
That's the jewelry?

29:19.122 --> 29:21.121
Normally I'd be disappointed.

29:21.123 --> 29:22.857
You clear on your part?

29:22.859 --> 29:25.562
Standard smash and grab,
not like I haven't done it before.

29:28.064 --> 29:29.333
That's my cue.

29:40.410 --> 29:42.843
Listen to me, Clark,
I've opened the gas main.

29:42.845 --> 29:46.080
One spark from your heat vision,
you blow up the entire block.

29:46.082 --> 29:47.751
And you know what building
we're under.

29:59.461 --> 30:00.463
Huh?

30:06.235 --> 30:08.468
Remember what I said
about the gas main?

30:08.470 --> 30:09.472
I lied.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.023
That hurt.

30:29.624 --> 30:31.728
It was supposed to.

30:33.129 --> 30:36.331
Hey!
What are you doing?

30:36.333 --> 30:37.998
What... Get your hands off...

30:38.000 --> 30:39.868
Shut up and hope the Big Blue
Boy Scout snaps out of it.

30:41.171 --> 30:43.905
Get control.
You can save her.

30:43.907 --> 30:46.576
It's your choice, not Ivy's.

30:49.077 --> 30:50.346
Damn it.

30:52.347 --> 30:54.617
Okay, looks like
we do it the hard way.

30:58.153 --> 31:00.220
Superman, help!

31:09.065 --> 31:10.265
Oh.

31:10.267 --> 31:12.365
How's your day been, honey?

31:12.367 --> 31:14.501
Mine's been... eventful.

31:14.503 --> 31:17.407
I'll explain everything.
I promise.

31:22.178 --> 31:24.381
I, uh, blacked out
for that part.

31:25.248 --> 31:27.084
You better have.

31:30.186 --> 31:31.855
Catwoman.

31:38.694 --> 31:40.129
He made me do it.

31:42.865 --> 31:45.832
I wouldn't get
too comfortable if I were you.

31:45.834 --> 31:47.001
Shit.

31:55.178 --> 31:56.910
Was that really necessary?

31:56.912 --> 31:58.280
Yes.

31:59.582 --> 32:01.282
You could have gotten
Lois killed.

32:01.284 --> 32:03.517
I had faith you'd save her.

32:03.519 --> 32:05.820
- Hmm.
- Batman.

32:05.822 --> 32:06.823
Catch.

32:10.492 --> 32:12.259
Synthetic kryptonite.

32:12.261 --> 32:14.597
- You know who made it?
- Working on it.

32:15.765 --> 32:17.700
Mother...

32:20.503 --> 32:22.703
None of this is my fault.

32:22.705 --> 32:26.407
I was forced to use Catwoman
to steal Bane's ransom.

32:26.409 --> 32:29.576
Then he made me
control Superman.

32:29.578 --> 32:31.514
Can't say he put up
much of a fight.

32:32.815 --> 32:34.515
What's his name?

32:34.517 --> 32:36.585
Now that would be telling.

32:39.822 --> 32:41.656
Not the hair!

32:44.427 --> 32:46.826
They may go easy on you,
but I won't.

32:46.828 --> 32:48.295
Name. Now.

32:48.297 --> 32:50.098
Hush.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.967
It's true,
he calls himself Hush.

32:52.969 --> 32:55.035
I never met him before.

32:55.037 --> 32:56.938
He knew a lot about me.

32:56.940 --> 32:58.871
Too much.

32:58.873 --> 33:00.675
That's enough.

33:00.677 --> 33:02.812
I'll take her.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.384
I think your business here
is done.

33:16.459 --> 33:19.595
You weren't supposed
to throw Lois off the roof.

33:20.796 --> 33:22.531
Is this your code again?

33:25.735 --> 33:28.402
Superman was going
to squish you.

33:28.404 --> 33:30.405
So I improvised.

33:30.407 --> 33:32.642
That's what partners do,
right?

33:46.488 --> 33:49.258
This just gets
better and better.

33:58.700 --> 34:01.768
Look at you, making an effort.

34:01.770 --> 34:05.938
So wait, does this mean Selina
is two-timing Batman with you,

34:05.940 --> 34:09.141
- or vice versa?
- Don't you have something to do?

34:09.143 --> 34:10.511
Nope.

34:10.513 --> 34:12.245
Just thought
of something else.

34:12.246 --> 34:14.214
Maybe she likes you both because
you're both the same guy,

34:14.216 --> 34:15.719
only she doesn't know it.

34:18.087 --> 34:19.456
Thank you, Alfred.

34:21.591 --> 34:25.362
There he goes.
Bruce Wayne on a genuine date.

34:27.330 --> 34:29.431
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do!

34:36.038 --> 34:37.407
Hello, Damian.

34:38.375 --> 34:40.540
Titus.

34:40.542 --> 34:42.775
<i>Pennyworth tells me you're romantically
involved with a criminal now?</i>

34:42.777 --> 34:45.812
Ex-criminal.
And it's only a date.

34:45.813 --> 34:48.081
<i>There are
no ex-criminals, Father,</i>

34:48.083 --> 34:50.817
<i>only ones who aren't breaking
the law at the moment.</i>

34:52.087 --> 34:54.321
She's not like that anymore.

34:54.322 --> 34:56.223
- Damian, I...
- <i>Look, I understand.</i>

34:56.225 --> 34:59.594
<i>This never-ending mission
of ours is a lonely endeavor.</i>

34:59.596 --> 35:02.730
<i>If this trollop provides
some carnal release, so be it.</i>

35:02.732 --> 35:04.065
"Trollop"?

35:04.067 --> 35:05.833
Your slang skills need work.

35:05.835 --> 35:08.801
<i>But I needn't bring up your
past poor choices in women,</i>

35:08.803 --> 35:11.172
<i>including but not limited to
my mother.</i>

35:11.174 --> 35:13.105
Damian, I'm not...

35:13.107 --> 35:14.908
<i>Not that I'm ungrateful being here, mind you...</i>

35:14.910 --> 35:17.109
<i>...however, I must insist
that you use protection.</i>

35:17.111 --> 35:18.413
<i>And another thing,</i>

35:18.415 --> 35:19.980
- <i>cover your drink.</i>
- Goodbye, Damian.

35:27.288 --> 35:29.589
Here's your steak, Larry.

35:29.591 --> 35:31.491
And one for you, Moe.

35:31.493 --> 35:33.261
And, Shemp,

35:33.263 --> 35:35.429
you get two because it's your birthday.

35:35.431 --> 35:37.563
Aw.

35:37.565 --> 35:40.266
I don't know why Mr. J
isn't here.

35:45.107 --> 35:46.239
Huh?

35:46.241 --> 35:49.076
Oh, he's not coming.

35:49.078 --> 35:53.647
Okay, freak, who are you and what
do you know about my puddin'?

35:53.649 --> 35:55.750
I know he needs your help.

35:55.752 --> 35:59.987
Hey, I'm the only one who gets
to tie up Mr. J!

35:59.989 --> 36:04.594
Just do me a little favor and
you can have him back again.

36:05.294 --> 36:06.829
Good as new.

36:09.565 --> 36:11.901
It's open. Come in.

36:18.140 --> 36:19.642
Are those for <i>moi?</i>

36:20.310 --> 36:22.512
Yes. You look...

36:23.346 --> 36:24.547
incredible.

36:25.413 --> 36:27.815
Right back at ya.

36:27.817 --> 36:31.051
- Is there time for a drink?
- Why not?

36:31.053 --> 36:34.922
You know, I had a bet with Eartha
here that you wouldn't show up.

36:34.924 --> 36:38.027
I thought for sure I'd get a phone call with some excuse.

36:39.460 --> 36:40.663
And yet...

36:43.098 --> 36:44.167
...here I am.

36:46.835 --> 36:48.268
Actually,

36:48.270 --> 36:50.774
I've been rethinking
certain things in my life.

36:51.540 --> 36:53.473
Ooh, confession time.

36:53.475 --> 36:55.109
Do tell.

36:55.111 --> 36:56.978
Nothing specific.

36:56.980 --> 36:59.182
I've just been feeling
the need to...

37:00.216 --> 37:02.116
change some things.

37:02.118 --> 37:03.951
I know the feeling.

37:03.953 --> 37:06.855
I've done some changing myself
since we first met.

37:07.991 --> 37:09.690
I was wilder then.

37:09.692 --> 37:11.525
I thought maybe that's
why you dropped me,

37:11.527 --> 37:15.027
too unrefined
for your social circle.

37:15.029 --> 37:16.730
That wasn't it.

37:16.732 --> 37:18.935
Truth be told,
I like that about you.

37:20.035 --> 37:22.504
I hope you're not
entirely tamed.

37:23.172 --> 37:24.737
No.

37:24.739 --> 37:26.810
But I like
to balance things more.

37:28.044 --> 37:29.045
To balance.

38:13.154 --> 38:17.694
"Wah, wah, wah." Crying clowns,
who needs them, am I right?

38:18.660 --> 38:20.259
Ladies and jerks,

38:20.261 --> 38:23.397
there's been a slight change
to tonight's program.

38:24.801 --> 38:26.199
Along with the opera
robbing you

38:26.201 --> 38:27.969
for 1,000 bucks a ticket...

38:27.971 --> 38:30.538
...we're gonna rob you too!

38:30.540 --> 38:32.138
Ha-ha!

38:32.140 --> 38:36.409
I'm also here for my puddin',
who's been clown-napped.

38:36.411 --> 38:38.812
To get him back,
I have to kill...

38:38.814 --> 38:40.748
Eh, not you.

38:40.750 --> 38:42.281
Maybe you.

38:42.283 --> 38:43.817
Uh, you!

38:43.819 --> 38:46.719
You I should kill
for that stupid beard!

38:46.721 --> 38:49.422
Oh, there you are.

38:49.424 --> 38:52.091
Bruce Wayne.

38:52.093 --> 38:55.996
Nice tux.
Hope it's not a rental.

38:58.000 --> 39:00.036
Whoa.

39:01.136 --> 39:03.502
Tom, get the ladies
to safety.

39:03.504 --> 39:06.172
Okay, but I'm coming back.

39:06.174 --> 39:08.009
What are you gonna do?

39:08.011 --> 39:11.344
She wants me, she'll follow me.

39:11.346 --> 39:14.281
Don't get killed.

39:18.520 --> 39:19.922
Bingo-matic.

39:30.966 --> 39:33.634
Hold still, you wascally wabbit.

39:34.969 --> 39:36.238
Whoops.

39:36.772 --> 39:38.575
Sorry, Rico!

39:41.176 --> 39:42.178
Huh?

39:43.712 --> 39:44.913
What?

39:47.950 --> 39:51.687
Your jester drag was over in the
'90s, now it's just sad.

39:56.625 --> 39:59.558
Oh. Oh!

39:59.560 --> 40:01.929
Hyah!

40:23.118 --> 40:25.622
What is it
the theater folks say?

40:27.156 --> 40:28.654
Break a face!

40:32.660 --> 40:34.728
Bats with Cats, now? Ugh.

40:36.064 --> 40:37.833
I just threw up
in my mouth a little.

40:40.736 --> 40:43.839
- Batman.
- Lie still. You've been hurt.

40:44.439 --> 40:45.906
Not that bad.

40:45.908 --> 40:47.210
Get the clown.

41:09.064 --> 41:10.596
Hmm?

41:12.134 --> 41:16.071
Oh, boy. This does not
look good, does it?

41:17.707 --> 41:19.272
Joker!

41:19.274 --> 41:22.942
You know what the joke
is here? I'm totally innocent.

41:22.944 --> 41:25.411
Ugh, that doesn't even
sound right, does it?

41:28.683 --> 41:33.185
Batsy, I was in a
basement until five minutes ago.

41:33.187 --> 41:36.156
I'm also looking for Harley.
Have you seen her?

41:38.493 --> 41:40.028
Stop. Stop!

41:53.709 --> 41:55.808
Stop. Stop!

42:04.053 --> 42:06.652
Batman, stop...

42:07.957 --> 42:10.591
Stop me if you've
heard this one before.

42:10.593 --> 42:12.192
Two guys walk into a bar...

42:23.138 --> 42:25.904
I want you to break your code,

42:25.906 --> 42:29.409
but for something
I actually did.

42:29.411 --> 42:32.346
Batman, don't!

42:32.348 --> 42:36.516
I'm warning you, Batman,
let him go!

42:38.386 --> 42:41.721
Do not make me do this,
not over him.

42:41.723 --> 42:44.857
I won't let you throw your life away.

42:46.794 --> 42:49.364
Gotham needs Batman.

43:18.326 --> 43:21.430
That sentimental
claptrap worked.

43:23.732 --> 43:26.065
Well, back to the grind.

43:26.067 --> 43:28.100
Who's Robin these days?

43:28.102 --> 43:29.669
Shut your damn mouth.

43:31.739 --> 43:33.540
Strip him.

43:33.542 --> 43:35.643
Double hand and leg cuffs.

43:35.645 --> 43:37.944
Ooh, kinky.

43:51.292 --> 43:53.993
<i>"Do not store up
treasures here on earth,</i>

43:53.995 --> 43:57.297
where moths eat them
and rust destroys them,

43:57.299 --> 44:00.132
and where thieves
break in and steal.

44:00.134 --> 44:02.036
Store your treasures
in heaven,

44:02.038 --> 44:04.538
where moths and rust
cannot destroy,

44:04.540 --> 44:07.043
and thieves do not break in
and steal.

44:08.609 --> 44:10.544
Wherever your treasure is,

44:10.546 --> 44:14.116
there the desires
of your heart will also be.

44:18.486 --> 44:20.187
Your eye is like a lamp,

44:20.189 --> 44:22.491
it provides light
for your body.

44:23.692 --> 44:25.091
When your eye is healthy,

44:25.093 --> 44:28.361
your whole body
is filled with light.

44:28.363 --> 44:30.630
But when your eye
is unhealthy,

44:30.632 --> 44:34.366
your whole body
is filled with darkness.

44:34.368 --> 44:38.207
And if the light you think
you have is actually darkness,

44:39.174 --> 44:41.509
how deep that darkness is."

44:51.152 --> 44:54.087
Knockout gas
from a jack-in-the-box.

44:54.089 --> 44:56.290
- Someone did their homework.
- The knockout gas

44:56.292 --> 44:58.424
only kept him unconscious
for 15 minutes.

44:58.426 --> 45:03.096
After coming to, Joker used the acid in
his boutonniere to burn through his ropes.

45:03.098 --> 45:05.399
How do you forget
about the boutonniere?

45:05.401 --> 45:08.201
He didn't. He wanted Joker to escape.

45:08.203 --> 45:11.837
It was all planned so Joker would
wake up in time to free himself,

45:11.839 --> 45:13.172
as Harley attacked.

45:13.174 --> 45:14.875
Then he ran to the opera,

45:14.877 --> 45:17.509
arriving just as
Tom was killed.

45:17.511 --> 45:20.080
So, the Joker
really is innocent?

45:20.082 --> 45:22.116
This time.

45:22.118 --> 45:25.520
The events of the past months reach as
high as Superman and as low as the Joker.

45:27.455 --> 45:30.123
All were set into motion
by Hush.

45:30.125 --> 45:32.391
But why kill Thomas Elliot?

45:32.393 --> 45:34.795
He's got no connection
to Batman.

45:34.797 --> 45:36.129
But he does...

45:36.131 --> 45:38.600
Did have one
with Bruce Wayne.

45:40.301 --> 45:42.704
Hush knows
Bruce Wayne is Batman.

45:55.216 --> 45:58.152
Hi, Selina. How are you?

45:58.154 --> 46:01.654
- Sorry I haven't returned your calls.
- <i>It's okay.</i>

46:01.656 --> 46:05.759
I just wanted to thank you
for... At the funeral.

46:05.761 --> 46:08.127
<i>That meant a lot to me.</i>

46:08.129 --> 46:10.397
I thought you could
use a friend.

46:10.399 --> 46:13.132
I'm so sorry about Thomas.

46:13.134 --> 46:15.103
He seemed like
one of the good ones.

46:15.770 --> 46:17.504
He was.

46:17.506 --> 46:20.973
Let's not wait another ten years
before seeing each other, okay?

46:20.975 --> 46:22.542
I'd like that.

46:22.544 --> 46:25.411
There's just some business
I need to take care of first.

46:25.413 --> 46:28.315
If I were you,
I wouldn't wait too long.

46:28.317 --> 46:31.053
<i>Are you saying
I have competition?</i>

46:32.120 --> 46:33.719
Full disclosure?

46:33.721 --> 46:37.390
I was seeing someone
on and off before you called.

46:37.392 --> 46:40.127
<i>It's complicated.</i>

46:40.129 --> 46:43.261
Ah. A mystery man.

46:43.263 --> 46:45.431
<i>You have no idea.</i>

46:45.433 --> 46:47.737
Well, may the best
mystery man win.

46:48.803 --> 46:51.337
Be careful what you wish for.

46:51.339 --> 46:53.575
Stay safe, Bruce.

47:00.714 --> 47:02.484
I didn't hear a thing.

47:05.921 --> 47:07.355
What now?

47:13.294 --> 47:15.730
Riddler.

47:18.267 --> 47:20.165
That C-lister?

47:20.167 --> 47:23.506
It's like they're all crawling
out from under the carpets now.

47:31.180 --> 47:33.647
It might be
none of my business,

47:33.649 --> 47:35.783
but I want you to know
I'm for this thing.

47:35.785 --> 47:37.116
Thing?

47:37.118 --> 47:38.685
You and Selina.

47:38.687 --> 47:40.487
Brucelina?

47:40.489 --> 47:42.788
Anyway, I think
she's good for you.

47:42.790 --> 47:44.493
She makes you...

47:47.196 --> 47:48.730
...less intense.

47:56.772 --> 47:59.138
Hold on.

47:59.140 --> 48:03.243
But if you're serious about her, you're
going to have to tell her everything.

48:03.245 --> 48:05.578
Otherwise it won't work.

48:05.580 --> 48:07.413
- You're right.
- I am?

48:07.415 --> 48:09.285
It's none of your business.

48:59.701 --> 49:01.033
Oh, shit.

49:02.103 --> 49:04.705
Hey, hey, I'm not resisting.

49:04.707 --> 49:05.672
Where is he?

49:05.674 --> 49:08.174
I know not
whom you speak of.

49:08.176 --> 49:09.875
Hush put you up to this.

49:09.877 --> 49:13.480
Can you rephrase that
in the form of a riddle?

49:15.317 --> 49:18.351
There was no riddle.
That's the point.

49:18.353 --> 49:20.252
Maybe I'm trying
something new.

49:20.254 --> 49:22.087
You know, shake things up.

49:22.089 --> 49:23.221
<i>♪ Shake, shake, shake ♪</i>

49:40.910 --> 49:43.444
I'm glad
you're here, Batman.

49:44.212 --> 49:45.978
Who are you?

49:45.980 --> 49:49.949
I'm the man that will
destroy your life before taking it.

49:49.951 --> 49:51.487
We'll see about that.

49:52.453 --> 49:55.087
We already have.

49:55.089 --> 49:57.492
Or at least Thomas Elliot has.

49:59.627 --> 50:03.763
You'll run in circles
as I kill your friends

50:03.765 --> 50:05.334
one by one.

50:06.768 --> 50:07.836
Face me.

50:09.571 --> 50:12.674
No one
you care for is safe.

50:40.234 --> 50:43.504
Soon, Batman.
Very soon.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.185
Batman.

51:00.187 --> 51:04.156
I'm not stealing anything,
just looking around.

51:04.158 --> 51:05.491
Old habits.

51:05.493 --> 51:08.395
I know this is your home,
Selina.

51:08.397 --> 51:10.830
I have for a long time.

51:10.832 --> 51:13.466
Right.
World's Greatest Detective.

51:13.468 --> 51:15.270
So why are you here?

51:16.004 --> 51:17.506
I want you to leave town.

51:19.808 --> 51:21.373
I don't know what
you think we have,

51:21.375 --> 51:23.310
but you don't get to
tell me what to do.

51:23.312 --> 51:26.245
I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't serious.

51:26.247 --> 51:29.515
Hush told me he's going to
hurt the ones closest to me.

51:29.517 --> 51:31.553
The ones I care for most.

51:32.821 --> 51:34.523
Okay. Unexpected.

51:36.158 --> 51:41.295
Whoever Hush is, he's been one
step ahead of me the whole time.

51:41.297 --> 51:43.365
He undoubtedly
knows we're involved.

51:46.768 --> 51:49.905
A few days ago,
I suffered a loss.

51:51.272 --> 51:54.841
It's been suggested
that I'm handling it better

51:54.843 --> 51:58.413
because I have you in my life.

51:59.848 --> 52:03.516
In your life?
Isn't that a bit much?

52:03.518 --> 52:05.620
Maybe it's time to find out.

52:08.357 --> 52:09.591
Wait.

52:10.158 --> 52:11.460
Are you sure?

52:14.096 --> 52:15.097
I am.

52:17.131 --> 52:19.067
Then let me.

52:24.806 --> 52:26.272
Bruce?

52:26.274 --> 52:27.910
Bruce Wayne is Batman?

52:28.843 --> 52:31.446
So, what now?

52:33.047 --> 52:35.417
Oh, I can think of
a few things.

52:45.960 --> 52:48.661
I don't often say
something was worth the wait,

52:48.663 --> 52:50.599
because I hate waiting.

52:51.466 --> 52:54.600
But that? Meow.

52:54.602 --> 52:56.437
I feel the same.

52:58.105 --> 52:59.475
Oh, my God.

53:00.075 --> 53:01.477
Your scars.

53:02.277 --> 53:03.609
So many.

53:03.611 --> 53:06.080
You, uh, remember these?

53:07.582 --> 53:09.817
I'd just gotten
my retractable claws.

53:10.651 --> 53:12.585
Cost a small fortune.

53:12.587 --> 53:14.120
They worked.

53:14.122 --> 53:16.725
I had to upgrade my
Kevlar body armor after that.

53:17.591 --> 53:19.160
Uh, sorry?

53:22.096 --> 53:24.029
That was why you
broke it off with me.

53:24.031 --> 53:26.901
- That's when you found out I was Catwoman.
- A kleptomaniac.

53:27.770 --> 53:29.134
What?

53:29.136 --> 53:34.507
Sorry, you were beautiful,
brilliant and accomplished.

53:34.509 --> 53:36.308
You could do
anything you wanted.

53:36.310 --> 53:38.411
I assumed you did it because
you couldn't stop, and...

53:38.413 --> 53:42.151
And if you can't control your
actions, you're not quite sane.

53:42.785 --> 53:43.886
Whole.

53:45.087 --> 53:46.455
And I was wrong.

53:47.055 --> 53:48.457
You did change.

53:48.957 --> 53:50.123
I'm sorry.

53:50.125 --> 53:53.762
It's okay.
We're in uncharted territory.

53:56.964 --> 53:59.732
Since you're not
leaving town,

53:59.734 --> 54:02.002
maybe we should
go to my place.

54:02.004 --> 54:03.071
Wayne Manor?

54:04.138 --> 54:05.640
Better.

54:16.216 --> 54:17.417
Huh?

54:17.419 --> 54:19.121
Whoa...

54:21.589 --> 54:23.121
You did it.

54:23.123 --> 54:25.759
You actually did it.

54:25.761 --> 54:27.796
Alfred, he did it!

54:29.596 --> 54:32.066
Hi, Selina. Dick Grayson.

54:35.337 --> 54:37.335
Pleasure.

54:37.337 --> 54:42.408
Ms. Kyle, I've taken the liberty to
prepare tea with assorted biscuits.

54:42.410 --> 54:44.511
So everyone knows who I am?

54:44.513 --> 54:47.145
Just us and Damian,
not Gordon.

54:47.147 --> 54:52.618
- Who's Damian?
- Robin, his... son.

54:52.620 --> 54:56.624
You two
are gonna have so much fun.

54:57.591 --> 54:59.026
Hmm.

56:10.564 --> 56:12.033
Morning, hon.

56:13.468 --> 56:14.835
Mwah.

56:15.569 --> 56:17.205
Pardon me. Ah.

56:18.772 --> 56:20.142
Oh, is that coffee?

56:22.009 --> 56:23.310
Mmm.

56:23.312 --> 56:25.645
We do have unclaimed coffee.

56:25.647 --> 56:27.015
Yours is better.

56:30.085 --> 56:31.320
Look at this.

56:37.257 --> 56:38.694
I'll even pay.

56:40.294 --> 56:41.329
Okay, you pay.

56:42.763 --> 56:44.332
After we catch Hush.

56:45.267 --> 56:46.998
Who's disappeared.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.435
Maybe he heard about your hot,
ferocious new partner,

56:49.437 --> 56:52.304
or died setting a bear trap
for you. Either way...

56:52.306 --> 56:54.373
You go. Take the jet.

56:54.375 --> 56:55.808
I have to be here.

56:55.810 --> 56:58.777
You won't always.
You know that, right?

56:58.779 --> 57:03.214
Dick will take over one day. Isn't
that what you've been grooming him for?

57:03.216 --> 57:04.549
He's not ready.

57:04.551 --> 57:07.118
And you were?

57:07.120 --> 57:11.958
I'm not asking you to retire, Bruce. I'm
asking you to spend some time away from this.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.158
With me.

57:15.196 --> 57:17.663
If we were to do this, we'd have...

57:17.665 --> 57:19.065
Mmm.

57:19.067 --> 57:21.500
I do apologize, sir.

57:21.502 --> 57:23.171
It's Commissioner Gordon.

57:26.707 --> 57:28.540
What is it, Jim?

57:28.542 --> 57:31.611
Two minutes ago, a silent alarm
was tripped at a medical practice.

57:31.613 --> 57:35.181
The office belongs to that
doctor Hush killed at the opera.

57:35.183 --> 57:36.616
Thomas Elliot.

57:36.618 --> 57:39.618
Yeah.
Thought you'd want to know.

57:39.620 --> 57:42.420
Thank you.

57:42.422 --> 57:45.458
There's been a break-in
at Thomas' practice.

57:45.460 --> 57:50.332
Ah. You know, maybe this is something
that Batman needs to do alone.

57:51.332 --> 57:53.000
This shouldn't take long.

58:04.078 --> 58:05.777
What a mess.

58:05.779 --> 58:07.346
Professional job.

58:07.348 --> 58:10.716
No fingerprints. No DNA
on any of the rifled papers.

58:10.718 --> 58:12.752
Not a robbery.

58:12.754 --> 58:15.924
Look at all this fencible crap.
What were they after?

58:17.591 --> 58:18.959
Information.

58:21.029 --> 58:23.696
Glioblastoma multiforme
brain tumor.

58:23.698 --> 58:25.531
Nearly inoperable.

58:25.533 --> 58:26.933
Well, that doesn't sound good.

58:26.935 --> 58:30.402
It isn't. For him.

58:30.404 --> 58:34.172
But it may be for us.
You up for a trip to Arkham?

58:34.174 --> 58:35.776
Oh, joy.

58:43.618 --> 58:45.317
Professor,

58:45.319 --> 58:47.922
it's time to pay
our respects.

58:52.127 --> 58:54.930
Going on patrol, Alfred.
Can you man the comms?

58:55.830 --> 58:59.031
Of course, Master Dick.

58:59.033 --> 59:01.400
Well, I'm not sitting around
doing nothing.

59:01.402 --> 59:02.938
Mind if I tag along?

59:04.404 --> 59:05.439
Hop in.

59:06.207 --> 59:07.408
But I'm driving.

59:12.212 --> 59:14.714
So, you guys used to do this
every night?

59:14.716 --> 59:16.448
Pretty much.

59:16.450 --> 59:18.917
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

59:18.919 --> 59:20.419
You can ask.

59:20.421 --> 59:23.190
How is it dating the man
who is Batman?

59:24.593 --> 59:26.426
It's weird.

59:26.428 --> 59:27.993
Complicated.

59:27.995 --> 59:30.196
Incredible.

59:30.198 --> 59:33.632
The only drawback is he just
won't shut up about his feelings.

59:35.536 --> 59:36.835
Good one.

59:36.837 --> 59:38.937
<i>71 Charlie.</i>

59:38.939 --> 59:40.605
<i>Report of a person breaking the
lock on the Gotham Cemetery gate.</i>

59:40.607 --> 59:42.810
<i>Suspect believed to be
inside the grounds.</i>

59:59.826 --> 01:00:02.428
It's like Halloween.

01:00:02.430 --> 01:00:04.529
Everything but
the Great Pumpkin.

01:00:04.531 --> 01:00:07.001
Catwoman, over here.

01:00:12.841 --> 01:00:15.176
Wait, I've been here before.

01:00:16.011 --> 01:00:17.379
So have you.

01:00:22.951 --> 01:00:24.783
- But why would someone...
- Nightwing!

01:00:40.801 --> 01:00:42.571
Have a face full of fear!

01:00:52.113 --> 01:00:54.248
No! Get away!

01:01:00.154 --> 01:01:01.987
Hold still.

01:01:01.989 --> 01:01:03.755
This will sting a bit.

01:01:09.797 --> 01:01:12.367
Mmm.
Scaredy-cat wants to play.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.344
- How?
- Nose plugs.

01:01:26.346 --> 01:01:28.413
Have you smelled
yourself lately?

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:40.725
No, he'll kill me!
I cannot fail.

01:01:44.832 --> 01:01:47.101
Sure you can. Ass.

01:02:01.248 --> 01:02:04.616
Stay back!

01:02:04.618 --> 01:02:08.554
Nightwing, it's Selina!
Stop fighting me!

01:02:17.598 --> 01:02:19.100
Get me to the car.

01:02:28.009 --> 01:02:29.708
Alfred, are you listening?

01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:31.342
<i>I am.</i>

01:02:31.344 --> 01:02:34.112
<i>I shall remote pilot
the Batmobile to the Batcave</i>

01:02:34.114 --> 01:02:36.517
<i>whilst you secure Scarecrow.</i>

01:02:59.908 --> 01:03:01.507
Now, now.

01:03:01.509 --> 01:03:03.745
Wouldn't wanna make it
too easy.

01:03:18.158 --> 01:03:21.060
So you finally
figured it out?

01:03:21.062 --> 01:03:22.828
I was getting bored.

01:03:22.830 --> 01:03:24.962
This is nuts.
How's the Riddler involved?

01:03:24.964 --> 01:03:26.765
He's been locked in here.

01:03:26.767 --> 01:03:29.569
When I saw the name Arthur
Wynne in Thomas Elliot's files,

01:03:29.571 --> 01:03:32.107
I knew he was more
than a bit player.

01:03:34.075 --> 01:03:36.574
Okay, I'll bite,
who's Arthur Wynne?

01:03:36.576 --> 01:03:39.245
Inventor of
the crossword puzzle?

01:03:39.247 --> 01:03:41.312
Cretin.

01:03:41.314 --> 01:03:46.150
It was the name you used when visiting
Dr. Thomas Elliot for your brain tumor.

01:03:46.152 --> 01:03:48.920
That useless incompetent!

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:50.455
Supposed to be so brilliant.

01:03:50.457 --> 01:03:53.893
He was the only doctor
who'd operate on me.

01:03:53.895 --> 01:03:59.332
After the surgery failed,
he told me to get my affairs in order.

01:03:59.334 --> 01:04:01.433
But I refused to let that
be the end of me.

01:04:01.435 --> 01:04:04.069
No, no, no,
I found another way.

01:04:04.071 --> 01:04:06.605
A Lazarus Pit.

01:04:06.607 --> 01:04:08.406
<i>All it took
was a few bribes</i>

01:04:08.408 --> 01:04:11.810
<i>and I was able to dip myself
in its healing waters.</i>

01:04:11.812 --> 01:04:14.045
<i>In that moment,
I saw everything,</i>

01:04:14.047 --> 01:04:15.748
<i>knew everything,</i>

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.387
<i>including the answer to my
most frustrating riddle...</i>

01:04:20.254 --> 01:04:22.589
<i>who is the Batman?</i>

01:04:29.629 --> 01:04:34.165
<i>It was so obvious, right
in front of me the whole time.</i>

01:04:34.167 --> 01:04:37.236
<i>In a flash of inspiration,
I saw a way to destroy you</i>

01:04:37.238 --> 01:04:42.243
<i>and get revenge on the criminal swine
who disrespected me in the past.</i>

01:04:45.747 --> 01:04:47.413
<i>I needed a new persona.</i>

01:04:47.415 --> 01:04:50.949
<i>My true identity
had to be kept hush, hush.</i>

01:04:50.951 --> 01:04:53.518
<i>One by one,
I convinced, cajoled,</i>

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:57.158
<i>and compelled the others
to play their part...</i>

01:04:58.859 --> 01:05:00.462
<i>and do my bidding.</i>

01:05:02.497 --> 01:05:05.129
<i>You see, Batman,
this is my game</i>

01:05:05.131 --> 01:05:07.701
<i>and everyone follows my rules.</i>

01:05:08.736 --> 01:05:10.536
Even you.

01:05:10.538 --> 01:05:13.575
That's some fancy monologuing
for a guy in cuffs.

01:05:14.241 --> 01:05:16.208
Batman caught you.

01:05:16.210 --> 01:05:19.279
Oh, woe is me. Foiled again.

01:05:20.214 --> 01:05:22.781
Time for a riddle, I suppose.

01:05:22.783 --> 01:05:25.420
Riddle me this,
Commissioner Gordon...

01:05:27.321 --> 01:05:29.257
who is Batman?

01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:31.623
Jesus.

01:05:34.728 --> 01:05:36.594
<i>Oh,
you shouldn't have done that.</i>

01:05:36.596 --> 01:05:38.632
<i>I was using it to control him.</i>

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:45.806
Shit, Clayface!

01:05:46.808 --> 01:05:49.611
Finally, I'm free.

01:05:56.850 --> 01:05:59.250
All right, get him!

01:05:59.252 --> 01:06:00.921
Yeah, kill him!

01:06:04.826 --> 01:06:07.625
Ooh, dinner and a show.

01:06:07.627 --> 01:06:10.062
This place isn't all bad.

01:06:18.439 --> 01:06:20.172
Yeah!

01:06:20.174 --> 01:06:23.574
You're seeing another villain already?

01:06:23.576 --> 01:06:26.111
I thought we had
something special.

01:06:26.113 --> 01:06:27.879
Shut up, freak!

01:06:27.881 --> 01:06:32.018
"Freak"? Batsy, are you going
to let him talk to me that way?

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.319
Get him, Clayface!

01:06:33.321 --> 01:06:35.821
Oh, it is so like you
not to defend me.

01:06:35.823 --> 01:06:38.924
How many others
were there? No, don't tell me!

01:06:40.828 --> 01:06:42.463
I guess the joke's on me.

01:06:43.364 --> 01:06:45.533
And scene.

01:06:50.471 --> 01:06:54.005
Way not to die, Batsy.

01:06:54.007 --> 01:06:58.076
Gordon! As usual, you're laying
there with your thumb up your ass.

01:06:58.078 --> 01:06:59.377
Do something, man!

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:04.583
Yeah!

01:07:04.585 --> 01:07:07.455
Bullseye!

01:07:21.667 --> 01:07:24.305
Now you're just
raining on my parade.

01:07:28.975 --> 01:07:31.546
Oh, no!

01:07:33.781 --> 01:07:35.980
Oh!

01:07:39.120 --> 01:07:40.484
Anyone got a mint?

01:07:42.522 --> 01:07:45.223
<i>Seems you're
still playing catch-up, Batman.</i>

01:07:45.225 --> 01:07:46.725
Let's end this, Hush.

01:07:46.727 --> 01:07:48.993
<i>Agreed, but you come to me.</i>

01:07:48.995 --> 01:07:51.998
<i>You see, I went to the
graveyard to catch a bat</i>

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.866
<i>but was off by a letter.</i>

01:07:53.868 --> 01:07:55.768
<i>Toodles.</i>

01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:57.939
What did that mean?

01:08:15.422 --> 01:08:18.923
Ah, admiring my beauty mark?

01:08:18.925 --> 01:08:23.093
The damage to you
may be more severe.

01:08:23.095 --> 01:08:24.629
Batman will find you.

01:08:24.631 --> 01:08:26.231
Of course he will.

01:08:26.233 --> 01:08:28.700
Within seconds, he'll have
dissembled the device

01:08:28.702 --> 01:08:31.837
I used to turn Clayface
into my doppelganger.

01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:34.673
He'll then know the effective
range is ten miles,

01:08:34.675 --> 01:08:36.542
and search that radius.

01:08:36.544 --> 01:08:37.942
Which means...

01:08:37.944 --> 01:08:40.648
we better get started.

01:08:47.054 --> 01:08:51.326
Batman will then contact Alfred
to confirm you're missing.

01:08:55.095 --> 01:08:57.595
Batman will come alone.

01:08:57.598 --> 01:09:00.798
He'll deduce I've prepared
a place for our showdown.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.337
He'll compile a list of every factory
and warehouse within the ten-mile radius,

01:09:05.339 --> 01:09:07.675
<i>of which there are 62.</i>

01:09:08.809 --> 01:09:11.276
He'll winnow that list to 14,

01:09:11.278 --> 01:09:13.279
too many to search one-by-one.

01:09:13.281 --> 01:09:15.779
Shut up! Shut up!

01:09:15.782 --> 01:09:17.950
Since I've left
no other clues,

01:09:17.952 --> 01:09:21.051
Batman will revisit
the name, Arthur Wynne,

01:09:21.054 --> 01:09:24.823
and check the names of the 14
places to find that only one

01:09:24.826 --> 01:09:27.761
<i>is an anagram
for "Arthur Wynne."</i>

01:09:28.461 --> 01:09:30.228
<i>"New Thurnary."</i>

01:09:30.229 --> 01:09:33.832
<i>Even allowing for traffic,
he should be here any minute.</i>

01:09:33.834 --> 01:09:35.133
Screw you!

01:09:35.135 --> 01:09:36.770
No time.

01:09:46.845 --> 01:09:49.346
<i>Riddle me this.</i>

01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:53.118
<i>"The less of me you have,
the more I am worth.</i>

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:54.122
<i>What am I?"</i>

01:09:59.260 --> 01:10:00.628
<i>Answer?</i>

01:10:01.295 --> 01:10:02.529
<i>A friend.</i>

01:10:12.205 --> 01:10:13.739
I'm going to kill you.

01:10:13.741 --> 01:10:17.042
You're not going anywhere
except down.

01:10:48.575 --> 01:10:50.142
What's a bat to do?

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:02.419
The briefest of reprieves,
I assure you.

01:11:02.421 --> 01:11:03.657
Ha!

01:11:08.961 --> 01:11:09.964
Ha!

01:11:30.751 --> 01:11:32.616
Tonight, I'll show them all

01:11:32.618 --> 01:11:35.119
by doing
what none of them could,

01:11:35.121 --> 01:11:36.454
killing the Batman!

01:11:42.763 --> 01:11:44.795
Can you feel it, Bruce?

01:11:44.797 --> 01:11:47.734
Can you feel it all
slipping away?

01:11:54.809 --> 01:11:56.611
What do you think of me now?

01:11:59.846 --> 01:12:01.279
You talk too much.

01:12:08.889 --> 01:12:12.156
I repeat,
what do you think of me now?

01:12:12.158 --> 01:12:14.927
That you're the same
insecure C-lister you were

01:12:14.929 --> 01:12:17.829
before you went
into the Lazarus Pit.

01:12:17.831 --> 01:12:20.265
Big talk from a dead man!

01:12:20.267 --> 01:12:23.034
You tell riddles a fifth grader could solve

01:12:23.036 --> 01:12:25.036
and you call yourself the Riddler.

01:12:25.038 --> 01:12:27.839
The sheer lack of imagination
is staggering.

01:12:27.841 --> 01:12:30.241
You take that back!

01:12:30.243 --> 01:12:31.677
A one-gimmick hack.

01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.311
The joke of the underworld.

01:12:33.313 --> 01:12:35.245
Damn you. Shut up!

01:12:36.983 --> 01:12:40.151
You think you got the best
of Ivy, Joker, and Bane?

01:12:40.153 --> 01:12:42.521
Once they find out
Hush was The Riddler...

01:12:44.023 --> 01:12:46.758
...they'll hunt you down like a dog.

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.826
It won't be pretty.

01:12:48.828 --> 01:12:51.062
I'm not
scared of them anymore!

01:12:51.064 --> 01:12:54.566
I'll kill them just like
I'm going to kill you.

01:12:59.439 --> 01:13:01.240
The effects of the Pit don't last forever.

01:13:01.242 --> 01:13:03.575
I'm betting even now
you can feel it.

01:13:03.577 --> 01:13:06.712
All that strength
and genius slipping away

01:13:06.714 --> 01:13:09.114
just when you need it most.

01:13:09.116 --> 01:13:10.848
No, no!

01:13:13.854 --> 01:13:17.121
Riddle me this,
who's his own worst enemy?

01:13:35.876 --> 01:13:38.109
I have you now!

01:14:37.170 --> 01:14:39.339
I win! I win!

01:14:40.107 --> 01:14:41.175
I win!

01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:48.983
Nine lives, remember?

01:14:51.151 --> 01:14:53.750
Now let's beat the crap
out of this asshole.

01:15:18.745 --> 01:15:20.147
Ahh! Oh...

01:15:29.421 --> 01:15:32.624
Don't let me die! Please!

01:15:32.626 --> 01:15:34.860
Pull me up.
Pull me up!

01:15:34.862 --> 01:15:36.026
Please!

01:15:36.028 --> 01:15:37.695
Leave him!

01:15:37.697 --> 01:15:39.899
Go!

01:15:45.272 --> 01:15:47.106
Wait!

01:15:47.108 --> 01:15:50.978
You're Batman,
you can't let me die!

01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:53.212
Screw this shit.

01:16:29.549 --> 01:16:31.252
He didn't have to die.

01:16:32.252 --> 01:16:33.420
What?

01:16:34.821 --> 01:16:36.524
He didn't have to die.

01:16:37.924 --> 01:16:39.894
You're crazy.

01:16:42.996 --> 01:16:45.429
You're absolutely insane.

01:16:45.431 --> 01:16:47.266
He killed your friend.

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:51.839
Tried to murder Nightwing. Hell, he almost
killed me and you're sorry he's dead?

01:16:53.506 --> 01:16:55.673
I had to try.

01:16:55.675 --> 01:16:57.478
If someone can be saved,

01:16:58.412 --> 01:16:59.980
I have to try.

01:17:02.416 --> 01:17:04.251
You do, don't you?

01:17:05.685 --> 01:17:07.651
It's a compulsion.

01:17:07.653 --> 01:17:10.288
You and your goddamn code.

01:17:10.290 --> 01:17:12.923
And you'll die because of it,
you know this, right?

01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:14.562
Will that make it all better?

01:17:15.428 --> 01:17:16.997
Without a code,

01:17:17.663 --> 01:17:19.366
I'm no better than them.

01:17:23.135 --> 01:17:25.235
I'm such a stupid fool.

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:27.941
I can't believe I let myself
get caught up in this again.

01:17:31.077 --> 01:17:32.576
No, I changed!

01:17:32.578 --> 01:17:35.813
I would have changed more,
a lot more, for you!

01:17:35.815 --> 01:17:37.251
For us!

01:17:41.522 --> 01:17:43.991
Selina, I...

01:17:50.630 --> 01:17:52.032
But you won't.

01:17:53.334 --> 01:17:55.901
Or can't.

01:17:59.538 --> 01:18:01.175
Maybe someday.

01:18:06.479 --> 01:18:08.014
But not today.

01:18:11.151 --> 01:18:12.586
Goodbye, Bruce.

01:18:30.303 --> 01:18:31.604
Someday.

01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:58.720
