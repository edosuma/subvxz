00:03.045 --> 00:05.297
Jaq and I have been making
actual plans.
Did you get it?

00:05.381 --> 00:06.746
SEYAH: And you’re sure
that’s everything we need?

00:06.883 --> 00:08.965
JOHN: Jaq’s long gone.
Jaq's safer being
far away from us.

00:09.051 --> 00:10.632
He's not a priority.

00:10.720 --> 00:12.506
I missed you, angry ginger.
(EXCLAIMS)

00:12.597 --> 00:14.963
We need to wake up Westerley.
Yeah, starting with Gared.

TU RIN: He’s safer in the dark.

ZEPH: We came here
to stir shit up
and blow shit up.

00:18.811 --> 00:21.644
How many ships were destroyed?
(SHOUTS) How many?

00:21.731 --> 00:22.811
30% of your
west seeding fleet.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.015
We have a rebellion.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.029
on a powerful inmate, Spar/ow.

00:32.116 --> 00:33.856
We're gonna do you
one better than finding out
who ordered the hit.

who's coming after me.

There are Killjoys
in our midst.

So, you're the little shit
who's been stealing our food?

No, I'm good.
SEYAH: More could be coming.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.509
We better find your damn cube
fast. You okay?

01:35.596 --> 01:38.133
It's not my cube.
ljust know we
have to go there next.

inside of it?

I bet it's some kind of weapon
to fight The Lady.

01:45.273 --> 01:47.764
Why don't you ever talk
about her, my mother?

01:50.653 --> 01:52.268
Because scars bleed
when you pick at them.

01:52.363 --> 01:54.900
Did she even want me?
Aneela? Very much.

the human-hybrid baby

02:11.257 --> 02:13.748

That way.

(WHISPERING) lfwe got
control of this thing,

02:41.871 --> 02:44.578
we could use it to attack
the terraforming plants
on Westerley.

Yeah, but...

02:45.791 --> 02:47.873
And then ifwe get word
to Zeph,

02:47.960 --> 02:50.042

02:57.178 --> 02:58.634

once and for all.

03:01.390 --> 03:04.507
Awesome. Just one question.

How do three people take over

Even ifyou can handle Coren,
what about the neck chips?

even a sniff of trouble,

convulsing in your own piss.

07:32.328 --> 07:34.865
So we take the chips out.
Brilliant.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.992
Well, why didn't anyone else
think of that? Oh, right.

07:38.083 --> 07:41.792
They did, and their heads blew
clean off their shoulders
when they tried.

And they still got
4,000 bloodthirsty criminals

to tear your heads off.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.501
When we take control
of the ship,

07:47.593 --> 07:49.049
we'll deposit the rest
of the prisoners on Arkyn.

You mean the empty,
desolate moon Arkyn?

for ourselves.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.140

for Westerley.

and it's in trouble, Sparlow.

to the Company's database,

08:18.290 --> 08:20.155
which he used to destroy
your Black Root fleet.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.956
Is that a statement
or a question you already
know the answer to?

08:25.798 --> 08:29.256
Concern yourself less
with that and more with this
Pree we're looking for.

08:29.760 --> 08:30.966
And so you know,

08:31.845 --> 08:35.337

your cuff doesn't mean

08:46.568 --> 08:49.435
Why would you care?
Why do you need me
to find Pree?

08:50.114 --> 08:52.901
You could put out a warrant
and have him on the armada
by day's end.

08:52.991 --> 08:54.492
And alert
the entire rebellion,

08:54.576 --> 08:57.192

underground? No.

of surprise,
and Iwill keep it.

this Pree is or not?

in his old life.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.548
Sparlow's right.
We're deeper in this shit
than we thought.

09:19.643 --> 09:21.474
Well, at least we're
used to that part.

09:21.895 --> 09:25.729

they're setting up
the preliminary rounds, huh?

what kind of signals
you picking up in this room?

a single-frequency spot jammer

09:31.113 --> 09:33.399

disabled during the fight.

09:35.617 --> 09:38.074
Thatjammer's
how they're doing it.
So?

09:38.162 --> 09:41.279
So, ifwe can get one of us
into the fight,
we can rip the chip out,

09:41.373 --> 09:43.989
and then I can use it
to control
every prisoner in here.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.745
How can we do that
with one chip?

09:45.836 --> 09:47.076
If I can upload the chip
to the mainframe,

09:47.171 --> 09:48.786
then I can bypass
the encryption keys,

09:48.881 --> 09:51.714
and I can use it to disable
all the security defenses
of every chip.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.506

get into the fight?

09:53.594 --> 09:55.050

better figure it out

to Rennika's office
to hack the mainframe.

09:58.807 --> 10:01.298

to Zeph about our plan.

into Rennika's office?

11:49.585 --> 11:50.950
the more respect they earn.

11:51.044 --> 11:52.329
DUTCH: Then we need
to figure out something fast.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.788
GUARD: Prisoner 8-9-4-3-6,
come with me.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.623
I knew they'd put me
in the fights.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.208
You're not in the fights.

11:59.303 --> 12:02.045
Oh, come on.
Well, what's this about?

12:02.139 --> 12:03.925
GUARD:
I don't ask questions,
and neither should you.

12:04.016 --> 12:05.722
Let's go, now!

12:08.478 --> 12:09.729
(SIGHS)

12:10.439 --> 12:11.679
Shit.

12:16.320 --> 12:18.436
Screw it. Hey!

12:22.409 --> 12:25.572
Lucky for you a punching bag
doesn't punch back.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.494
(NECK CRACKS)

12:27.581 --> 12:28.787
Okay.

12:29.499 --> 12:30.705
All right, come on.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.919
(BOTH GRUNTING)

12:39.593 --> 12:40.958
Stand down.

12:41.845 --> 12:45.178
You miss solitary
that much, Yardeen?
We can help you with that.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.675
SYLAS: Stop.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.719
Solitary can wait.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.511
I want to see her fight.

12:52.648 --> 12:55.856
WARDEN: This is
my ship, remember?
And this is my tournament...

12:55.943 --> 12:59.151
For which we pay you
good money to host, remember?

12:59.237 --> 13:00.522
Oh, she fights.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.039
Hmm.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.533
Ma'am.

13:16.630 --> 13:19.793
I've been waiting a long time
for someone like you.

13:22.344 --> 13:25.677
Someone big,
good stock, strong.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.129
I may be a prisoner,

13:27.224 --> 13:30.216
but that does not mean
that I'm into weird sex stuff

13:30.310 --> 13:33.802
or normal sex stuff.
I have rights.

13:33.897 --> 13:34.932
Oh, Trees, no.

13:35.023 --> 13:37.014
I don't need you
for any sex stuff.

13:37.109 --> 13:38.440
Okay, because I
wasn't going to do...

13:38.527 --> 13:40.142
ljust need you
to kill my brother.

13:44.157 --> 13:48.400
Things on Qresh
have gotten complicated
since we lost Westerley.

13:49.413 --> 13:50.823
Power struggles
are worse than ever,

13:50.914 --> 13:52.370
to say nothing
of the food shortages.

13:52.457 --> 13:55.039
So you're the reason
the prison slop
is literally slop?

13:55.127 --> 13:56.583
At least you have food.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.040
If it was up to Sylas,
you'd all starve.

14:00.132 --> 14:02.088
One of the many things
we disagree on...

14:03.677 --> 14:06.009
And one of the reasons
he wants to kill me.

14:06.096 --> 14:09.213
Look, I'm sorry that you
and your brother
aren't besties,

14:10.017 --> 14:13.350
but I am not a murderer.
I'm not asking you
to be a murderer.

14:17.941 --> 14:20.023
I'm asking you
to save my life.

14:26.074 --> 14:27.530
He's still not here.

14:27.617 --> 14:31.701
No, but he will come back,
even if he doesn't know why.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.906
You see,
emotions are the baseline
of human experience.

14:36.001 --> 14:40.461
At the most basic level,
they're a series
of chemical interactions.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.038
The way your brain reacts
to certain stimuli,

14:43.133 --> 14:44.714
both internal and external.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.670
At the highest level,

14:48.180 --> 14:51.092
they represent
the immeasurability
of the human experience.

14:54.311 --> 14:55.676
Drinkthis up.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.148
You're smiling.
What is that?
What have you done?

15:09.242 --> 15:12.530
The Nupa root,
it's a common treat
for Westerley children.

15:12.621 --> 15:16.159
The body you're in
remembers something that
you've never experienced.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.580
What?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.282
The comforts of home,

15:19.669 --> 15:21.045
a parent's embrace,

15:22.422 --> 15:24.083
the most powerful
emotion of all,

15:25.342 --> 15:26.331
love.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.419
Understand that,
you'll understand us.

15:36.061 --> 15:38.017
JOHN: The chip usually sits
around the carotid artery,

15:38.105 --> 15:40.687
so be careful taking it out
or gusher city, all right?

15:43.318 --> 15:45.024
(BEEPING)

15:45.112 --> 15:47.694
There's yours.
Here, show me where.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.365
It's there.

15:52.452 --> 15:56.070
Just got to take the chip out
of the guy before the end
of the fight.

16:00.127 --> 16:03.711
Are you gonna say something
or should I?

16:04.673 --> 16:06.914
About what?
Ever since we got away
from The Lady,

16:07.008 --> 16:08.214
things have been weird.

16:08.844 --> 16:11.335
Things are usually
weird with us.
It's our brand.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.803
(CHUCKLES)
I'm kind of used to it.

16:14.766 --> 16:16.097
So you're gonna keep
avoiding me, then?

16:16.184 --> 16:18.049
I'm not avoiding you.
Bullshit.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.053
D'av told me...

16:22.732 --> 16:24.472
What you're going through.

16:27.779 --> 16:30.566
Yeah, well, he shouldn't have.
No, he shouldn't have, Johnny.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.989
It should have been you.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.528
What happened to us
on Westerley was weird
for all of us.

16:40.250 --> 16:41.956
But whatever it was,
it wasn't real.

16:42.085 --> 16:44.201
I don't want
to talk about this.
We have to,

16:44.296 --> 16:45.832
'cause I need your head
in the game.

16:45.922 --> 16:49.164
Whoa! When have I ever
not had your back?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.458
I never said that you didn't.
Oh, really?

16:51.553 --> 16:53.259
'Cause that's what
it sounds like to me.

16:53.763 --> 16:54.752
Hey.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.298
What's going on?

16:58.768 --> 17:00.019
Just two friends talking.

17:02.314 --> 17:03.645
Good luck in the fight.

17:08.361 --> 17:09.942
Are you okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:17.871 --> 17:19.327
Is it working?

17:19.664 --> 17:21.325
What do you see?
Nothing.

17:21.917 --> 17:22.952
Okay.

17:23.043 --> 17:25.079
Give me your hands, quitter.

17:26.254 --> 17:28.461
Now close your eyes.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.415
And breathe.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.730
What? What? Did you see it?

17:48.610 --> 17:50.851
It's my dad. He's in trouble.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.402
We have to go back to the Quad
to save him.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.320
Whoa. After we find the cube.
No, now.

17:54.407 --> 17:56.944
You'll be walking into a trap.
You don't know that.

17:57.035 --> 17:58.900
Using your enemy's loved ones
against them,

17:58.995 --> 18:01.281
I invented that move.
It's Bad Bitch 101.

18:01.373 --> 18:03.409
But they're in trouble.
We all are, Jaq.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.208
We don't all get to do
the things we want and have
the life we wanted

18:07.295 --> 18:09.627
in the middle
of a godsdamn apocalypse.

18:10.423 --> 18:12.835
Now, you were born
to do a job,
and you will do it

18:13.510 --> 18:17.253
because I have not gone
through all of this shit
protecting you for nothing.

18:23.186 --> 18:25.518
I wish you were the one
we lost in the Green.

of the preliminary round,

18:40.161 --> 18:44.404
we have Rankev
versus Yalena Yardeen.

18:46.418 --> 18:49.751
A surprise late addition.
Better late than boring.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.248
Let's fight.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.545
EVI: Good luck to you both.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.499
Sparlow can't protect
you in here, Killjoy.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.380
My boy's gonna make you wish
you'd never been born.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.007
He's gonna make you scream!

an absolute outrage.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.915

where you tell me
biting is frowned upon?

No, this is the part
where I ask
what you were thinking.

20:07.499 --> 20:09.364
If you thought
Coren Jeers
hated you before...

20:09.459 --> 20:10.699
Coren and I go way back.

a "You're out of my fights"
kind of lecture.

isn't my anything.

(CHUCKLES) Not a fan
of human cockfighting?

coming in here

20:25.517 --> 20:26.927
and telling me
how to run my ship?

20:27.018 --> 20:28.929
No. No, I'm not a fan.

20:29.020 --> 20:31.056
Yet you still
take their money.

20:31.147 --> 20:33.399
Well, prisons don't run
on love alone.

20:35.902 --> 20:39.690
You know, you could be
the first person
since the Bellaxion started

20:39.781 --> 20:41.521
that could beat
the Qreshi champion.

20:43.326 --> 20:44.736
Wait, you want me
to keep fighting?

20:44.828 --> 20:46.159
Qreshis hate
being embarrassed.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.953
That's why they make prisoners
run a gauntlet of violence

20:49.040 --> 20:51.907
before facing a killer
who hasn't broken a sweat.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.371
Now, that's hardly fair.

20:54.462 --> 20:57.169
But from what I hear,
you can fight, Yardeen.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.793
And ifyou beat their champ,

20:58.883 --> 21:01.340
maybe they'll think twice
before pissing
in my pool anymore.

21:01.428 --> 21:02.793
What's in it for me?

21:02.887 --> 21:04.593

for as long as you're in here.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.013
Not good enough.
(CHUCKLES) I'm not surprised.

21:09.519 --> 21:11.305
I want Johnny Jaqobis
to go free.

21:13.022 --> 21:15.183
Well, that's a big ask.

21:15.275 --> 21:16.765
Not really.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.351
Look, you only need
one of us on this ship.

21:19.946 --> 21:22.858
Send Johnny away,
and you're still running
a surplus.

21:26.119 --> 21:27.404
All right.

21:27.912 --> 21:29.118
You have a deal.

21:30.415 --> 21:33.373
But try anything stupid,
and you'll have an enemy.

but no offense.

Yes, I'll talk to her.

to the land of the laundry?

22:37.106 --> 22:38.812
Starch your shirt,
steam your collar?

22:39.484 --> 22:40.519
Or is it the other way around?

22:40.610 --> 22:42.350
We seem to have
encountered a virus

22:42.445 --> 22:44.902
that's causing
the food dispensers
to serve larger portions.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.605
Oh, no, more slop!
That is a problem.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.988
So far, it's just harmless
but annoying.

22:51.329 --> 22:52.318
And if we run out of food...

22:52.413 --> 22:54.449
"Harmless" and "annoying,"
and you thought of me?

22:54.582 --> 22:57.119
Should I be flattered?
It depends on
if you can fix it or not.

22:57.210 --> 23:01.078
Based on your profile,
you seem to be a bit
of a computer whiz.

23:01.172 --> 23:04.414
You've been creeping
my profile?
I should be flattered.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.594
You know what? You should save
your smartass banter

23:09.681 --> 23:11.467
for somebody that might
actually appreciate it.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.015
Now, I'll ask you again.
Can you fix it or not?

23:14.102 --> 23:16.138
You'll have to get me
into the top-level BIOS,

23:16.229 --> 23:17.639
but once I'm in...

23:18.773 --> 23:20.013
You can leave it with me.

23:21.234 --> 23:22.349
Hmm.

23:24.237 --> 23:25.647

23:31.995 --> 23:33.451

in a way that makes sense.

the platform by inputting
the Puckrin DDX Capacitor"

don't you understand?
Literally all of it.

Okay, fine.
Then we'll just wait
for the warden,

23:43.548 --> 23:45.539
and you can explain to her
why one of her prisoners
knows her system

23:45.633 --> 23:47.498
better than one of her
high-paid techs.

23:47.594 --> 23:49.130

the understanding type.

to work my magic.

24:23.713 --> 24:26.750
Are you sure that isn't
what you want?
I don't know what I want.

24:27.133 --> 24:29.124
I don't even know
what to say
to him anymore, D'av.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.651
Warden, is everything okay?
No.

25:40.748 --> 25:41.863
According to med bay,

25:41.958 --> 25:44.199
the guy your friend Yardeen
put in the infirmary

25:44.293 --> 25:46.249
didn'tjust lose
three pints of blood.

25:48.297 --> 25:49.286
Ouch!

25:49.382 --> 25:52.249
She's a hellcat, that one.
He also lost his ID chip.

25:54.262 --> 25:56.093
Mmm. That's weird.
Maybe.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.557
Or maybe that was
the whole point of the fight.

26:00.476 --> 26:01.511
I'm not following.

26:05.606 --> 26:09.474
Well, hopefully
you can follow this.
Enjoy solitary.

26:10.570 --> 26:11.935
You'll be there a while.

(PRISONERS CHANTING)

26:24.584 --> 26:26.575
Guys, easy
with the merchandise.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.506
Shit.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.211
Double shit.

26:38.306 --> 26:40.262
D'AVIN: Are you okay?
What hurts?

26:40.349 --> 26:42.055
Whatever you're touching.

26:42.810 --> 26:44.971
Do you really think
you can keep going?
I've been worse.

26:45.062 --> 26:46.347
Actually, I don't think
you have.

26:46.439 --> 26:47.849
There's a first time
for everything.

26:47.940 --> 26:49.350
Stop.

26:50.651 --> 26:52.937
After I've had a lie-down.
WARDEN: Now.

26:55.448 --> 26:58.531
I warned you, Yardeen,
and you still found a way
to screw with me.

26:58.618 --> 27:01.701
She has won every fight
you put her in.
How is that screwing with you?

27:01.788 --> 27:04.029
Because she obviously thought
it would keep me too busy

27:04.123 --> 27:05.829
to notice the chip
that she stole

27:06.250 --> 27:09.333
oryourhackerboy
worming his way
into my office.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.411
I don't know what
the three of you are up to,

27:11.506 --> 27:13.997
and I don't care,
because John Jaqobis
is in solitary,

27:14.091 --> 27:18.130
you're out of the fights,
and the deal is off.

27:18.221 --> 27:21.054
And as soon as this
Bellaxion bullshit is over,

27:21.140 --> 27:24.223
I'm sending this one off
with the Qreshis.

27:24.310 --> 27:26.016
And you...
(CHUCKLES)

27:28.481 --> 27:34.772
I'm sending you
to the deepest, darkest
slaver pit I can find.

Come on, come on, come on.

SPARLOW: For once,
it's good to see you, Killjoy.
We need to talk.

27:56.551 --> 28:00.260
Nah, you need to save
your energy for that
Qreshi at the end.

28:00.680 --> 28:02.295
I'm rooting for you.
We all are.

28:02.390 --> 28:03.755
We need to get Johnny
out of solitary.

28:03.850 --> 28:06.182
You still owe us a favor.
We're calling it in.

28:07.270 --> 28:08.476
What's the rush?

28:09.730 --> 28:11.345
Johnny forgot his night-light.
What's the difference?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.146
Sounds like they're up
to something.

28:13.234 --> 28:17.227
Yeah, heard
about that little handoff
in your first fight.

28:17.947 --> 28:20.734
You want my help?
Start talking.

28:23.619 --> 28:25.826
We have a way
of taking over
this whole ship.

28:25.913 --> 28:29.531
Lock down the guards,
knock out the cons,
but we need Johnny.

28:29.625 --> 28:31.035
How the hell you gonna
knock out everyone?

28:31.127 --> 28:33.960
That little handoff
got us a chip.

28:34.046 --> 28:36.753
Johnny's got it to turn out
everyone's lights.

28:36.841 --> 28:39.298
lfyou help us,
yours stays on.

28:39.927 --> 28:41.428
Everybody's lights?

28:43.014 --> 28:44.254
DUTCH: Yep.

28:46.392 --> 28:47.802
All right.

28:47.894 --> 28:49.509
The last fight,
when everyone's watching

28:49.604 --> 28:51.640
you and the Qreshi,
that's when I'll bust him out.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.813
I'm not in the fights.
(SPARLOW CHUCKLES)

28:53.900 --> 28:55.891
That's gonna be a problem.
Why?

28:55.985 --> 28:57.646
Because prisoners love
an underdog,

28:57.737 --> 28:59.819
which is how you've earned
such a big following.

28:59.906 --> 29:01.862
Quit now,
they gut you like a pig,

29:01.949 --> 29:04.156
and I can't be seen
backing a quitter.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.074
There's no way Rennika's gonna
put me back in the fight.

29:06.162 --> 29:07.698
Not unless someone makes her.

29:21.177 --> 29:23.384
You don't know how much
this means to me.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.007
Yeah, well, just make sure

29:25.097 --> 29:27.304
that the warden puts my friend
in the final fight...

29:28.851 --> 29:30.182
I'll do whatever you want.

29:31.145 --> 29:32.760
I'll be waiting
on my ship to leave

29:32.855 --> 29:35.141
as soon as you're done
what you have to do.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.935
You're going to need this.

29:41.238 --> 29:45.527
Honestly, I'm more of
a shooty-stabby kind of guy,
but thanks.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.324
When it goes off,
you will demand to see me.

29:47.411 --> 29:50.403
A guard will take you
to my quarters,
but I won't be here.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.284
Sylas will, alone.

29:53.376 --> 29:55.162
You've thought
of everything, huh?

29:55.252 --> 29:57.959
Unfortunately, my brother
hasn't left me much choice.

29:59.006 --> 30:03.750
I'm going to ask you
one last time, Carl,
where is Prima Dezz?

30:04.470 --> 30:08.634
Did he steal your tablet, too?
Because I'm pretty sure
he stole mine.

30:08.724 --> 30:09.975
Killjoys. Huh!

30:10.059 --> 30:12.641
They don't take
bribes or sides,
but, you know, tablets?

30:12.728 --> 30:14.264
Fair game, apparently.

30:15.106 --> 30:16.596
Is she even old enough
to be in here?

30:16.691 --> 30:17.976
You need to stop lying
to us, Carl.

30:18.067 --> 30:20.479
I'm not, really. I'm not.
Then why are you so fidgety?

30:22.113 --> 30:23.978
All right. All right.

30:26.534 --> 30:29.196
It's the Nupa root. I knew
I shouldn't have had it.

30:29.286 --> 30:31.993
It never sat well with me,
but I thought
maybe this time...

30:32.081 --> 30:33.696
Nope.Nope.

30:33.916 --> 30:36.407
I honestly don't know
how much longer I can
keep the portal shut,

30:36.502 --> 30:38.003
'cause”.

30:38.087 --> 30:39.793
Nice to meet you.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.461
(GROANS) Oh, God.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.083
You were right.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.463
Humans always do
come back to love.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.134
At least you didn't lie
about that.

30:53.060 --> 30:57.144
I'm afraid I don't understand.
No. You're afraid that I do.

30:58.065 --> 31:01.353
That's why you're stalling,
isn't it, for Yala?

31:01.902 --> 31:04.939
Because you love her,
because you think
you can protect her.

31:05.990 --> 31:07.355
You can't.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.317
Now, either find Pree

31:11.412 --> 31:14.449
or find someone who will burn
down the galaxy for him.

31:14.540 --> 31:18.658
Use him or so help me,
she will burn
with the rest of them.

31:25.468 --> 31:26.924
Don't start.

31:27.928 --> 31:30.089
ljust wanted to say...
Look, you're starting.

31:30.181 --> 31:32.046
That you're doing a good job.

31:35.519 --> 31:36.679
You think so?

31:38.105 --> 31:40.812
I've been a bit too murder-y
around him.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.640
And I don't think
he's ever had a vegetable.

31:42.735 --> 31:45.852
He's still alive.
He's not broken.

31:47.656 --> 31:50.648
But you're bruising him.
He's not cold like you are.

31:50.743 --> 31:52.859
Well, maybe he needs to be
to survive all this.

31:52.953 --> 31:56.081
He doesn't need to be
like you to survive,
but he does need you.

31:58.209 --> 31:59.619
Why are you pushing him away?

32:00.920 --> 32:03.707
This hasn't exactly been
my banner year, Killjoy.

32:03.798 --> 32:07.040
My life on Qresh,
my immortality,

32:07.843 --> 32:09.049
Aneela...

32:09.804 --> 32:10.919
All...

32:13.432 --> 32:15.013
There's a saying
in First Tongue...

32:15.101 --> 32:17.012
(SPEAKS FOREIGN LANGUAGE)

32:17.478 --> 32:19.093
"Never claim
what you might lose."

32:19.188 --> 32:21.520
Yeah, well,
my people have a saying, too.

32:22.399 --> 32:23.900
"Emotional cowards
are shitheads

32:23.984 --> 32:25.565
"who end up alone
and deserve it."

32:25.653 --> 32:26.893
My, you come
from a colorful tribe.

32:26.987 --> 32:29.194
Jaq has been trying
to tell you something all day.

32:29.281 --> 32:32.489
You need to listen.
It's important.
You need to wake up.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.070
Wake up!

32:38.624 --> 32:39.659
Jaq?

32:40.793 --> 32:42.499
No,no,no,no.

32:44.338 --> 32:45.373
Jaq.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.373
(SHOUTS) Jaq!

32:52.221 --> 32:53.461
Okay. Okay.

32:53.556 --> 32:58.220
Okay, so, ifthe warden
finds Newcy in the office,
you just say...

32:58.310 --> 32:59.516
You can just tell her...

32:59.603 --> 33:02.640
This is a lot easier when you
have a computer to talk to.

33:03.607 --> 33:05.393
MAN: Hey, Mannion.
Take a walk.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.403
What is this?
SPARLOW:
It's your lucky day, Killjoy.

33:11.907 --> 33:12.896
Let's go.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.160
Where's Dutch?

33:15.244 --> 33:17.280
If she's doing
what we planned,

33:17.371 --> 33:19.737
she's getting ready
for the fight of her life.

33:23.127 --> 33:24.583
You don't have to do this.

33:25.087 --> 33:27.749
Do What, kill the Qreshi?

33:27.840 --> 33:29.330
I'm not gonna do anything.

33:29.425 --> 33:32.667
We'll have this whole place
on lockdown
before it gets even close,

33:33.387 --> 33:34.797
ordead.

33:34.889 --> 33:36.254
Whatever comes first.

33:38.809 --> 33:41.642
I'm sorry I got us
into all of this.

33:41.979 --> 33:44.812
Hey, it's just one more fight.
It's notjust the fight.

33:45.858 --> 33:47.644
It's you having to make a deal
with the Qreshis,

33:47.735 --> 33:49.271
me having to do
whatever the warden says.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.647
It's all the Corens
and the Sparlows...

33:51.739 --> 33:53.775
Hey, hey.
Save it for the ring.

33:56.202 --> 33:59.786
I have spent my whole life
being manipulated by Khlyen,

34:00.873 --> 34:03.580
doing whatever he wanted.

34:04.877 --> 34:07.289
And just when I think
I find a way out,

34:08.881 --> 34:11.588
a monster comes along
and puts me in a cage.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.837
It never ends.
It will.

34:14.929 --> 34:16.135
And then what?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.378
Hmm?

34:20.059 --> 34:23.347
She's ruined the one thing

34:24.647 --> 34:26.478
that keeps me
getting back up again,

34:28.359 --> 34:30.145
that keeps me grounded,

34:31.820 --> 34:32.980
my gravity.

34:35.241 --> 34:38.654
She took my Johnny away,
and I don't know
how to get him back.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.448
That”

34:44.208 --> 34:46.824
That is what you need
to tell John, okay?

34:48.254 --> 34:49.994
(SNIFFLES)

34:50.089 --> 34:51.169
But first,

34:52.007 --> 34:54.498
you need to kick
some giant Qreshi ass.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.876
Okay?

34:58.389 --> 34:59.845
Okay.

35:01.183 --> 35:02.514
(SNIFFLES)

35:28.961 --> 35:31.577
Are you good?
Yeah.

35:32.423 --> 35:34.880
I just got to keep fighting
until we get Sparlow's sign.

35:35.592 --> 35:36.627
No.

35:36.719 --> 35:38.675
Everyone will know
if you're fighting
just not to lose.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.549
You remember
what Sparlow said?
You have to fight to win.

35:42.683 --> 35:44.219
Look around.

35:44.310 --> 35:47.723
You beat this guy,
we won'tjust have a bunch
of pissed-off prisoners.

35:48.188 --> 35:49.689
We'll have an army.

35:56.488 --> 35:59.480
Please still be here.
Yes! (GRUNTS)

36:00.242 --> 36:01.277
First I'll deal
with the chips,

36:01.368 --> 36:02.904
and then I'll open the armory
for your people,

36:02.995 --> 36:04.860
but they better be ready.
They're ready.

36:04.955 --> 36:07.162
These are the IDs
you have to disable.

36:08.083 --> 36:09.198
You sure got a lot of backup.

36:09.293 --> 36:11.033
In this place, you can never
have too many friends.

36:11.128 --> 36:12.413
Disabling these
will take too much time.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.914
There's too many protocols
to override.

36:14.006 --> 36:15.837
Well, the plan falls apart
ifyou don't.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.211
Ah, shit. Okay...

36:18.302 --> 36:20.964
Uh, I'll just erase them
from the system.

36:21.055 --> 36:22.044
Good.

36:38.155 --> 36:40.066
ANNOUNCER: Fighters,
take positions.

36:51.919 --> 36:53.204
DUTCH: Hey.

37:02.805 --> 37:03.920
(GASPS SOFTLY)

37:07.935 --> 37:09.300
Okay.

37:14.191 --> 37:15.226
(GUN FIRES)

37:16.235 --> 37:20.524
Shit. That's not the plan.
Newce, restore
all disabled IDs.

37:20.614 --> 37:21.979
No,no,no,no,no.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.525
Breach! Disable all prisoners!

37:28.080 --> 37:29.570
(POWER SURGING)

37:33.710 --> 37:35.166
I got her, boss.

(LAUGHING)

37:37.798 --> 37:39.538
COREN: Hold yourfire!

37:39.633 --> 37:40.668
Leave her.

37:41.385 --> 37:44.798
Where can she go?
This ship is mine.

37:44.888 --> 37:47.925
SPARLOW: What was that, Coren?
Sorry, Sparlow.

37:49.518 --> 37:50.928
This ship is ours.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.512
You lying piece of rat shit.

37:54.606 --> 37:58.690
Hey, no need
to get hurtful, Killjoy.
Just a matter of numbers.

37:58.777 --> 38:01.393
Me and Coren's
versus you and...

38:01.488 --> 38:03.444
Hmm.
(LAUGHS) You.

38:03.532 --> 38:06.399
You mean all the prisoners
who were just cheering for me.

38:06.493 --> 38:09.405
SYLAS: For the record,
I am not with them.

38:10.414 --> 38:14.123
lam an Qreshi. How dare you?

38:14.209 --> 38:15.460
Shut him up.

38:16.420 --> 38:17.500
(WHIMPERS)

38:20.799 --> 38:22.300
And now,

38:23.177 --> 38:25.509
we can really
settle the score.

38:38.817 --> 38:41.479
KHLYEN: The world
is a very dangerous place.

38:42.154 --> 38:45.692
There are enemies everywhere,
always ready to do us harm.

38:46.992 --> 38:49.950
What is the thing
that keeps us safe?

38:50.370 --> 38:53.237
It’s not the law,
nor is it strength.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.448
It’s what we can do
for each other.

38:57.294 --> 39:00.502
Whether it’s the people
we love or the ones
we meet along the way,

39:01.089 --> 39:02.750
this is all we have.

39:04.468 --> 39:07.926
This is what makes us human.

39:13.685 --> 39:15.266
Don't you agree?

39:16.855 --> 39:19.892
I don't really know
what you mean or who you are.

39:22.778 --> 39:25.941
I'm the only person
that can save
the one you love.

39:27.616 --> 39:30.983
Gared, it's time to wake up.

39:38.919 --> 39:39.999
SEYAH: Hey.

39:42.589 --> 39:45.171
I'm getting pretty good
at this tracking business.

39:53.308 --> 39:57.893
You asked me in the forest
what we are now
without Aneela.

40:00.148 --> 40:01.809
I didn't plan for you, Jaq.

40:03.110 --> 40:05.021
I wasn't the type to want you.

40:06.154 --> 40:07.485
lwas full.

40:08.699 --> 40:10.030
lwas fine.

40:11.910 --> 40:15.573
And now you're here,
and I'm still fine.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.829
But I won't be...

40:23.672 --> 40:25.708
If anything ever
happens to you...

40:29.177 --> 40:31.668
Because you are my son.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.014
And I am your mother.

40:38.270 --> 40:41.137
And losing Aneela
doesn't change any of that.

40:44.151 --> 40:45.857
Queens don't cry, remember?

40:46.361 --> 40:47.942
(CHUCKLES)

40:48.030 --> 40:49.770
This one does now.

40:51.116 --> 40:53.232
She's a teeny bit broken.

40:53.327 --> 40:54.442
(SNIFFLES)

40:55.871 --> 40:57.077
But...

40:59.166 --> 41:02.329
If saving your dad
is what you need to do...

41:04.129 --> 41:05.414
It's up to you.

41:08.634 --> 41:10.090
What are you looking at?

41:11.011 --> 41:12.467
The cube.

41:14.514 --> 41:17.802
Are you being funny?
If so, you're very bad at it.

41:24.650 --> 41:26.686
Close your eyes and breathe.

41:30.072 --> 41:31.562
Now open them.

41:38.664 --> 41:41.076
How did I not see that?

41:42.042 --> 41:43.953
I think you can only see it
when you're ready to.

41:47.089 --> 41:48.829
This is why we needed
Dutch's DNA.

41:50.425 --> 41:52.256
(DEVICE BEEPING)

41:55.597 --> 41:56.586
What's wrong?

41:58.058 --> 41:59.798
Promise you'll find my dad.

42:24.459 --> 42:25.710
Kendry.

42:26.628 --> 42:27.913
HOW did...

42:30.298 --> 42:31.287
Hi.

42:32.259 --> 42:33.248
Hi.
