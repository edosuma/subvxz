Jules.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.667
Hey, Terry, I'm almost
done with your arrangement.

00:51.667 --> 00:53.500
I'm just adding some
tulips for effect.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.834
Perfect.

00:54.834 --> 00:56.667
Well, you know your bouquets
are my good luck charm.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.083
Every open house.

00:58.083 --> 01:01.625
Well, I predict you'll have
multiple offers by 5:00pm.

01:01.625 --> 01:02.625
I hope so.

01:02.625 --> 01:03.417
Mmmhmm.

01:03.417 --> 01:04.750
So are you ready for today?

01:04.750 --> 01:06.291
As I'll ever be.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.583
If I get this duplex it will
be my biggest undertaking yet.

01:08.583 --> 01:10.333
Oh, it's in an up and
coming neighbourhood.

01:10.333 --> 01:14.166
I sold a house there that
went for way over asking.

01:14.166 --> 01:15.875
Maybe you can finally branch out
on your own

01:15.875 --> 01:18.125
and flip houses full time.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.375
I heard that, Terry.

01:20.375 --> 01:22.041
And while I'll miss having her
around here

01:22.041 --> 01:24.875
I am all for her being
a full-time designer.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.208
See? Now that's a good boss.

01:27.208 --> 01:29.166
Well, it helps when
she also raised you.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.917
Well, you've come a long way
since that first flip you did-

01:34.917 --> 01:36.583
Oh, Alice, we don't
talk about the first flip.

01:36.583 --> 01:39.458
Oh. Ok, well you've learned
a lot since the flip

01:39.458 --> 01:41.125
we do not mention.

01:41.125 --> 01:42.375
And I'm proud of you.

01:42.375 --> 01:43.542
Thank you, mom.

01:43.542 --> 01:44.625
And don't worry, I'm still
gonna help you

01:44.625 --> 01:46.166
at the Home and Garden show.

01:46.166 --> 01:48.166
It's too bad you can't buy
both sides of the duplex

01:48.166 --> 01:49.750
because then I could sell two.

01:49.750 --> 01:52.417
I can't afford both sides,
and only one is up for auction.

01:52.417 --> 01:54.542
The other one
sold six weeks ago.

01:54.542 --> 01:55.667
Here you go.

01:55.667 --> 01:57.291
Speaking of, I need to get
to the bank

01:57.291 --> 01:59.709
and then I'm meeting Kenny,
my contractor.

01:59.709 --> 02:02.417
I've gotta get to my open house
but call me when you're done!

02:02.417 --> 02:04.041
You got this!

02:14.208 --> 02:15.375
It's rough, Jules.

02:15.375 --> 02:17.125
Come on, what do
I always say?

02:17.125 --> 02:19.291
An empty house is a story
waiting to happen.

02:19.291 --> 02:21.000
But you see the potential, right?

02:21.000 --> 02:22.041
Well, it's my job.

02:22.041 --> 02:23.667
What's your renovation budget?

02:23.667 --> 02:26.709
Well, it's hard to know exactly
without inspection.

02:26.709 --> 02:27.709
It's going up as is.

02:27.709 --> 02:29.125
No inspections allowed.

02:29.125 --> 02:31.667
So we won't know what
we've got until we've got it?

02:31.667 --> 02:32.959
Wouldn't be the first time.

02:32.959 --> 02:34.333
You know who owns
the other side?

02:34.333 --> 02:35.667
Nothing in the public
record yet,

02:35.667 --> 02:37.750
and it was empty when
I went to check it out.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.500
So we're flying blind here?

02:40.500 --> 02:41.291
Come on, Kenny.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.458
We love a good challenge.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.083
Yeah, yeah, of course.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.917
Ok, and what's your bid?

02:45.917 --> 02:48.750
$127,000 max.

02:48.750 --> 02:52.041
If I go over I'll be dipping
into renovation funds.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.542
Or my personal savings.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.125
Now, don't overextend yourself, ok?

02:55.125 --> 02:57.959
There's always
unforeseen expenses.

02:57.959 --> 03:01.458
Ok. I put in an extra shot
of espresso.

03:01.458 --> 03:03.250
So what time is the auction?

03:03.250 --> 03:04.667
We're heading there right now.

03:04.667 --> 03:06.083
Ok, fingers crossed.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.041
Thanks, Kat.

03:07.041 --> 03:08.000
Thank you.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.333
Welcome.

03:11.959 --> 03:13.125
I have a feeling about this one.

03:13.125 --> 03:14.709
You said that the last
four times.

03:14.709 --> 03:17.166
And I was right the last
four times so we're all good.

03:20.458 --> 03:21.250
Hey, isn't that-

03:21.250 --> 03:22.291
No.

03:22.291 --> 03:23.375
No, no, no, he lives
in Portland now.

03:23.375 --> 03:24.834
That must be his dad.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.458
They both have Waddell trucks.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.834
Well, good.

03:27.834 --> 03:30.208
'Cause I don't need any
more competition in this town.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.500
Alright, how's my game face?

03:43.500 --> 03:44.625
Ooh, you're ready.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.417
Let's do this.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.500
Okay, so $127,000.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.667
And remember, never
go over your max.

03:54.667 --> 03:55.834
I know, I know.

03:55.834 --> 03:57.250
Like the last flip
pay for your next flip.

03:57.250 --> 03:58.125
Yes, exactly.

03:58.125 --> 03:58.959
Yes.

03:58.959 --> 04:01.041
Oh, I'm- I'm so-

04:01.041 --> 04:02.458
Hi, Jules.

04:02.458 --> 04:04.083
Lance.

04:06.417 --> 04:08.333
I am gonna go sign you in.

04:08.333 --> 04:09.291
Lance.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.917
Kenny.

04:11.917 --> 04:13.667
I guess that wasn't his dad's
truck, right?

04:13.667 --> 04:15.709
Yeah. Got that.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.500
What're you-
what're you doing here?

04:20.500 --> 04:23.333
I thought you were in Portland
doing the contractor thing.

04:23.333 --> 04:25.208
I was but then my dad asked me
to come back

04:25.208 --> 04:28.291
and help him with the business
here in Bedford.

04:28.291 --> 04:29.166
So you are.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.458
So I am.

04:31.458 --> 04:34.166
Still flipping houses I hear,
with Kenny no less.

04:34.166 --> 04:36.458
And who'd you hear that from?

04:36.458 --> 04:38.250
Well you know, people talk.

04:38.250 --> 04:42.250
Small real estate community.

04:42.250 --> 04:44.291
Ok, my dad told me.

04:45.333 --> 04:47.333
Says you're getting pretty good
at it, too.

04:47.333 --> 04:48.834
You say that like
you're surprised.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.208
No, not surprised at all.

04:50.208 --> 04:54.041
You're organized, good follow
through, completely...

04:54.041 --> 04:55.583
determined.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.250
Well, I guess I don't believe in
the fly by the seat of my pants

04:58.250 --> 05:01.083
method of business,
tends to be costly.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.333
Well, you never know
what you're gonna get

05:02.333 --> 05:03.500
until you open up the walls.

05:03.500 --> 05:04.834
You gotta be willing to bend.

05:04.834 --> 05:07.500
I'm always willing to bend.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.583
Except when you're not.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.041
Oh, I bend.

05:10.041 --> 05:13.000
When a bendable
situation arises.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.542
But you can't always act
on impulse,

05:14.542 --> 05:15.917
it's irresponsible.

05:15.917 --> 05:18.917
There's a difference between
impulse and instinct.

05:18.917 --> 05:22.542
Veering from the plan is always
a recipe for disaster.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.125
Well, I guess that's where
you and I disagree.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.667
Oh, that's where?

05:25.667 --> 05:28.625
As opposed to everywhere else?

05:28.625 --> 05:31.959
Ok, you got me on that.

05:31.959 --> 05:35.625
I guess we probably didn't make
the best... team.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.250
You look good, Jules.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.166
Hey, Jules?

05:42.166 --> 05:43.709
Your lot's coming up next.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.750
My lot's coming up next.

05:46.750 --> 05:50.083
So I hear. Good luck.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.792
Thank you.

05:51.792 --> 05:53.709
You're welcome.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.667
Well, that wasn't awkward
at all.

06:10.667 --> 06:12.000
Not in the slightest.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.291
Little bit awkward for me,
but that's alright.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.875
What're you doing?

06:15.875 --> 06:18.083
Bidding on the Holland Avenue duplex.

06:18.083 --> 06:21.125
I'm bidding on the Holland
Avenue duplex.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.417
Well, I guess that would explain

06:22.417 --> 06:25.500
both of our attendance
here today.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.208
So it's on then.

06:27.208 --> 06:28.959
I guess it's on, yeah.

06:28.959 --> 06:32.250
<i>Next property up for bid,
lot 127.</i>

06:32.250 --> 06:35.750
A two-bedroom, two bath
1800 square foot duplex,

06:35.750 --> 06:40.417
left side unit only,
located at 1218 Holland Avenue.

06:40.417 --> 06:44.125
I'll start the bidding
at $70,000.

06:44.125 --> 06:46.083
$70,000, thank you.

06:46.083 --> 06:47.458
Do I hear $75,000?

06:47.458 --> 06:48.792
$75,000 on the floor.

06:48.792 --> 06:49.834
Thank you.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.333
So, what's your max bid?

06:51.333 --> 06:54.667
Oh, come on, Lance, you don't
ask a lady that number.

06:54.667 --> 06:57.250
Just wanna know what
I'm dealing with here.

06:57.250 --> 07:01.125
Come on, how deep
are those pockets?

07:01.125 --> 07:02.500
Deep enough.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.208
You just worry about
your own pockets.

07:05.208 --> 07:07.625
How about $90,000
for this property here?

07:07.625 --> 07:08.917
1800 square feet.

07:08.917 --> 07:10.208
<i>Do I hear $90,000?</i>

07:10.208 --> 07:12.417
$90,000 down in front.
Thank you.

07:12.417 --> 07:14.250
Interesting technique.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.291
Driving the price up, kinda
bidding against yourself that
way, but-

07:16.291 --> 07:18.000
I've done this before,
I know what I'm doing.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.000
Alright.

07:19.000 --> 07:20.542
Besides, you're
not even bidding.

07:20.542 --> 07:22.166
Well, I like to sit back
and wait.

07:22.166 --> 07:24.583
See who's been priced out,
then I pounce.

07:24.583 --> 07:25.750
Well, you better hurry up

07:25.750 --> 07:28.208
because I'm about to wrap
this thing up.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.166
We'll see about that.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.041
$95,000 for this property.

07:33.041 --> 07:34.792
Thank you again, sir.
$95,000.

07:34.792 --> 07:35.834
$100,000.

07:35.834 --> 07:38.000
Do I hear $110,000?

07:38.000 --> 07:39.667
$110,000.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.500
You call that a pounce?

07:41.500 --> 07:43.542
$120,000.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.709
$125,000. Thank you.

07:45.709 --> 07:47.500
$127,000.

07:47.500 --> 07:51.625
And we have a high bid
of $127,000.

07:51.625 --> 07:55.709
Going once,
going twice...

07:55.709 --> 07:58.041
$132,000.

07:58.041 --> 07:59.709
$135,000.

07:59.709 --> 08:01.083
It seems we have
a bidding war here.

08:03.709 --> 08:05.375
$140,000.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.166
That is way over your max.
Just cut your losses.

08:07.166 --> 08:09.291
There are other properties.

08:09.291 --> 08:12.041
Too rich for my blood.

08:12.041 --> 08:17.542
$140,000 going once...
going twice...

08:17.542 --> 08:23.250
$143,000.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.375
Going once, going twice...

08:26.375 --> 08:28.834
Well, I guess I'm the one
who's out now.

08:28.834 --> 08:32.792
Sold for $143,000 to paddle
number 11.

08:32.792 --> 08:35.959
<i>Our next property
up for bid, lot 128.</i>

08:35.959 --> 08:37.208
Congratulations.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.583
Mmm.

08:38.583 --> 08:41.709
<i>Two bedroom, one bathroom,
910 square-foot house.</i>

08:41.709 --> 08:42.917
It's- it's ok.

08:42.917 --> 08:44.500
It'll be fine, we'll
just have to economize.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.333
We don't even know what
we're dealing with yet.

08:46.333 --> 08:48.834
So we'll economize and pray.

08:48.834 --> 08:50.500
So what was that back there?

08:50.500 --> 08:51.959
That was Lance being Lance.

08:51.959 --> 08:53.417
Jules, that was
like two years ago.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.000
How is he still able
to get under your skin?

08:55.000 --> 08:55.917
He's not.

08:55.917 --> 08:56.792
Oh, he is.

08:56.792 --> 08:57.834
Kenny, he's not.

08:57.834 --> 08:58.917
But he's always so sure
of himself,

08:58.917 --> 09:00.583
acting like I don't know
what I'm doing.

09:00.583 --> 09:04.333
Ok, alright, I stand corrected.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.959
I mean, it was the first time
for both of us

09:05.959 --> 09:08.083
flipping that house,
not just me.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.667
He had never done it
without his dad.

09:09.667 --> 09:10.709
Well, you learned a lot.

09:10.709 --> 09:13.083
Mostly never to work
together again.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.291
Because he blamed me when things
went wrong

09:15.291 --> 09:20.709
even though he made a big
decision without consulting me.

09:20.709 --> 09:23.542
Everything was different
between us after that.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.542
Well, things didn't go wrong,
you broke even.

09:25.542 --> 09:26.959
It happens.

09:26.959 --> 09:30.667
Breaking even is a loss
when you consider time spent.

09:30.667 --> 09:35.291
I lost a lot more than money
on that project.

09:35.291 --> 09:38.583
But I imagine he
won't be here long.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.166
When things go wrong he leaves.

09:40.166 --> 09:42.458
Well, hopefully you won't have
to run into each other again.

09:42.458 --> 09:45.208
Besides, we have way
bigger issues to deal with,

09:45.208 --> 09:48.417
like that $16,000 deficit
in your budget.

09:48.417 --> 09:50.208
Yeah.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.458
There is no need
to worry, Jules.

09:55.458 --> 09:58.000
I'm a miracle worker,
you know that.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.875
I'm counting on that.

10:05.417 --> 10:10.000
This is great, having you back
in the shop again.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.625
Get used to it, pop.

10:11.625 --> 10:12.875
It's home now.

10:12.875 --> 10:16.792
Good because all of this
is gonna be yours soon.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.834
I like this piece.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.333
Yeah, it's not bad.

10:20.333 --> 10:23.333
It helps me clear my head.

10:23.333 --> 10:25.792
I ran into an old friend today.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.041
Jules.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.917
Well, that was bound
to happen eventually.

10:28.917 --> 10:29.917
I guess.

10:29.917 --> 10:32.041
How was it?

10:32.041 --> 10:36.125
Well, it's safe to say she's
still upset with me for leaving.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.542
Well, maybe over time she'll be
just as happy as I am

10:38.542 --> 10:39.959
to have you back here.

10:42.333 --> 10:44.375
I wouldn't count on that, pop.

10:48.583 --> 10:50.875
You know Lance,
I've been thinking...

10:50.875 --> 10:53.875
all this stuff is just
gathering dust.

10:53.875 --> 10:55.500
I told you when
you sold the place, pop,

10:55.500 --> 10:57.458
that I'm keeping those.

10:57.458 --> 10:58.834
I made them for mom.

10:58.834 --> 11:00.750
I know that, son.

11:00.750 --> 11:03.542
It's been three years and all
she ever really wanted for you

11:03.542 --> 11:05.959
was to share your abilities
with the world.

11:05.959 --> 11:07.917
And I do.

11:07.917 --> 11:11.000
Waddell Contracting
and Renovations.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.000
Speaking of which,

11:12.000 --> 11:13.500
if we're gonna get you
to retire

11:13.500 --> 11:15.542
we better get back
to the real work.

11:21.542 --> 11:22.333
Hey, morning.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.333
Morning.

11:23.333 --> 11:24.208
Oh, thanks.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.500
So, what do you think?

11:25.500 --> 11:27.333
Well, it's not terrible.

11:27.333 --> 11:29.083
Good bones, did a loop
around the exterior,

11:29.083 --> 11:30.208
no sizeable cracks.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.959
Went underneath,
foundation looks good.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.333
Wow, you're fast.

11:33.333 --> 11:35.125
Yeah, well, you're
not my only client.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.875
Hmm.

11:38.458 --> 11:40.500
Yes, but I'm the only one you've
known since you were nine

11:40.500 --> 11:41.667
so I'm your favourite one.

11:41.667 --> 11:43.667
Yeah, true. Very fair.

11:43.667 --> 11:45.250
Whew.

11:45.250 --> 11:47.375
You know, I really hope this is
worth the price of admission.

11:47.375 --> 11:49.083
You read my mind.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.375
Come on. Let's go in and see
what we're dealing with.

11:52.375 --> 11:54.166
Looks like the roof needs work.

11:54.166 --> 11:56.583
Stairs need to be replaced,
the railings are loose

11:56.583 --> 12:00.625
and we're gonna have to patch
that stucco before we paint.

12:02.834 --> 12:04.667
Ok.

12:04.667 --> 12:05.875
Moment of truth.

12:05.875 --> 12:07.750
Please let the truth be kind.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.542
It's not so bad.

12:15.542 --> 12:16.792
It's not so good, either.

12:16.792 --> 12:18.959
Yeah, but I've done a lot
with much worse.

12:38.208 --> 12:41.792
We got this.

12:41.792 --> 12:45.041
Yeah. We've got this.

12:47.959 --> 12:49.959
We're definitely gonna need to
replace the electrical wiring.

12:49.959 --> 12:51.625
The whole system needs
an upgrade.

12:51.625 --> 12:53.834
I'll put it on the list,
along with a nice hardwood

12:53.834 --> 12:57.709
in place of this,
whatever this is.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.083
Hello!

12:59.083 --> 13:01.458
Hey Terry, we're in here!

13:01.458 --> 13:04.709
Oh wow, this is... charming.

13:04.709 --> 13:07.917
Yeah. A sea foam green.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.709
Just wanted to come check
out what I'll be selling.

13:10.709 --> 13:14.250
Well, it's rough but
we're getting there.

13:14.250 --> 13:16.959
Sounds like the neighbours got
a head start on renovations.

13:16.959 --> 13:18.625
Yeah, they must have
just gotten here.

13:18.625 --> 13:21.208
I should go talk to them
about the exterior.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.375
If you can hear them.

13:23.917 --> 13:25.834
Well, we'll be paying them
back soon enough with our demo.

13:25.834 --> 13:27.750
Yeah, which will be soon, so I'm
gonna start working on my quote

13:27.750 --> 13:28.625
and I'll call you later
to discuss.

13:28.625 --> 13:29.333
Perfect.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.083
Ok.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.500
Hey, be gentle!

13:32.917 --> 13:34.333
Oh, oh, oh, oh!!!

13:37.959 --> 13:39.709
That wasn't supposed to happen.

13:39.709 --> 13:40.959
Hi Terry.

13:40.959 --> 13:42.041
Hi Jules.

13:42.041 --> 13:43.291
Lance?

13:43.291 --> 13:45.250
What're you doing?

13:45.250 --> 13:46.750
Looks like I slipped.

13:46.750 --> 13:48.083
No. No, no, no.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.709
No, I mean what- what-
what are you doing here

13:50.709 --> 13:53.333
on the other side of my wall?

13:53.333 --> 13:56.125
I'm demoing my wall.

13:56.125 --> 13:59.000
Wait, you own that side?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.375
Yeah.

14:00.375 --> 14:02.417
Made sense to try
to buy both but uh,

14:02.417 --> 14:04.000
you win some, you
lose some, right?

14:04.000 --> 14:05.583
No, no.

14:05.583 --> 14:09.125
Why- why didn't you
say something at the auction?

14:09.125 --> 14:10.917
Look, I'm gonna get this thing
fixed today.

14:10.917 --> 14:13.083
I take responsibility
for my mistakes.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.792
Oh, oh, do you now?

14:14.792 --> 14:16.000
Yeah? Really?

14:16.000 --> 14:17.291
Because that really
wasn't ever your thing.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.166
You know, now, walking away?

14:19.166 --> 14:21.125
That. That you're good at.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.709
Ok, I guess we're
doing that now.

14:22.709 --> 14:24.000
Yeah, no, no, no.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.166
We're not- we're not doing that,
we're um...

14:26.166 --> 14:27.917
we're gonna go get coffee.

14:27.917 --> 14:31.250
We're gonna... make some plans.

14:31.250 --> 14:32.125
Right.

14:32.125 --> 14:34.166
Ok.

14:34.166 --> 14:34.959
- Ok. Bye Lance.
- Bye Terry.

14:34.959 --> 14:36.000
Nice to see you.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.375
Yeah. Always.

14:38.375 --> 14:42.583
Oh, I take mine with cream,
no sugar.

14:49.041 --> 14:50.709
Cream. No sugar.

14:50.709 --> 14:53.208
Wow, thanks.

14:53.208 --> 14:54.417
The wall's all patched.

14:54.417 --> 14:56.000
Oh, thank you. I appreciate that.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.792
So to what do I owe
this gesture?

14:58.792 --> 14:59.625
Apology?

14:59.625 --> 15:00.709
Gesture.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.709
We need to talk
about the exterior.

15:02.709 --> 15:03.750
Come on in.

15:03.750 --> 15:05.333
Thank you.

15:05.333 --> 15:06.667
I'm sure there's more things to
discuss than just the exterior.

15:06.667 --> 15:08.083
No there's not.

15:08.083 --> 15:10.250
There's no need to rehash
anything, it's all good.

15:10.250 --> 15:11.792
Are you sure? I tried calling
you a few times.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.125
Oh, well you said it all
back then, Lance.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.792
You made your choice and
I learned to live with it.

15:14.792 --> 15:15.834
It's fine.

15:18.542 --> 15:19.709
You seem kind of behind

15:19.709 --> 15:23.417
considering your side sold
way before mine.

15:23.417 --> 15:25.166
I'm knocking down
a load-bearing wall

15:25.166 --> 15:27.625
so I had to get an architect
to draw up some plans.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.625
Which wall?

15:31.625 --> 15:32.709
Oh I'll never tell.

15:32.709 --> 15:34.208
Oh.

15:34.208 --> 15:37.625
Still being secretive about
knocking down walls I see.

15:37.625 --> 15:39.709
It was a closet.

15:39.709 --> 15:41.083
And it was not a secret.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.625
I came back to find
the master closet gone.

15:44.625 --> 15:46.500
The master closet.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.500
There was still a linen closet.

15:48.500 --> 15:51.000
Closet space is precious.

15:51.000 --> 15:54.250
You knocked $10,000
off the selling price.

15:54.250 --> 15:57.417
That was an expensive decision
without even consulting me.

15:57.417 --> 15:59.250
Well I'm glad we're
not rehashing the past.

15:59.375 --> 16:02.125
No, we're definitely not.

16:03.959 --> 16:05.750
You're knocking down the wall
between the dining room

16:05.750 --> 16:07.625
and the kitchen because that's
the only one that makes sense.

16:07.625 --> 16:09.417
Unless, of course,
you're still in the habit of

16:09.417 --> 16:12.500
knocking down walls
that don't make sense.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.417
It made the bedroom bigger!

16:14.417 --> 16:17.291
With less closet space!

16:17.291 --> 16:18.709
Hold on.

16:18.709 --> 16:20.041
You're not knocking down
the wall between

16:20.041 --> 16:23.041
the kitchen and the
dining room too, are you?

16:23.041 --> 16:25.875
I'll never tell.

16:25.875 --> 16:28.041
I'm gonna find out eventually.

16:28.041 --> 16:30.125
Our open houses are probably
going to occur

16:30.125 --> 16:31.750
around the same time.

16:31.750 --> 16:33.375
Not if I finish first.

16:33.375 --> 16:35.917
Well I plan on being done in...
eight weeks.

16:35.917 --> 16:38.500
What a coincidence.
So do I.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.542
Do I sense a little wager
brewing?

16:42.458 --> 16:44.000
We go head to head.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.500
Eight weeks.

16:45.500 --> 16:47.667
May the best flip win.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.250
Who's the judge of the best?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.500
We go by final sale price.

16:51.500 --> 16:53.041
What's the winner get?

16:53.041 --> 16:54.458
More money.

16:54.458 --> 16:59.500
And the satisfaction of
beating me if you can do it.

16:59.500 --> 17:01.625
Oh, I can, and I am in.

17:01.625 --> 17:08.333
Ooh. Well, may the best woman,
or man, win.

17:08.333 --> 17:10.000
Bring it.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.375
It's been brought.

17:11.375 --> 17:13.166
Ok.

17:17.542 --> 17:19.500
Oh, thank you for the coffee
by the way,

17:19.500 --> 17:21.583
that was very sweet.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.166
Hey.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.333
Sorry I'm late.

17:35.333 --> 17:36.792
I was finishing an arrangement
for my mom

17:36.792 --> 17:39.166
and after this I'm meeting
Kenny at the duplex.

17:39.166 --> 17:41.417
You are quite the multi
- hyphenate these days.

17:41.417 --> 17:42.917
Oh, triple-hyphenate.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.291
There's also the Home
and Garden show,

17:44.291 --> 17:45.875
my mom's shop always
has a booth.

17:45.875 --> 17:47.000
Oh, everyone has a booth.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.208
I have a booth.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.625
It's a great way to get
your name out there.

17:50.625 --> 17:52.208
You should have a booth.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.583
Oh, I don't know, I have
the duplex to worry about,

17:54.583 --> 17:56.083
and my mom's greenhouse.

17:56.083 --> 17:58.750
Oh come on, Jules,
you are so good at this.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.959
People just need to know
you're out there.

18:01.959 --> 18:03.458
Hey.

18:03.458 --> 18:06.667
Everyone is talking about
the excitement the other day.

18:06.667 --> 18:07.834
Wait, what did you hear?

18:07.834 --> 18:08.834
The auction.

18:08.834 --> 18:10.625
You and your ex
going toe to toe.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.792
Had a lot of tongues
wagging around here.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.500
And yet no one could bother
to tell me he was back.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.834
It hasn't been that long.

18:18.834 --> 18:21.000
Yes, and already he's
making my life difficult,

18:21.000 --> 18:24.458
using my favourite tile guy
so he's unavailable for me.

18:24.458 --> 18:27.083
Do you think Lance is
doing that on purpose?

18:27.083 --> 18:31.875
Did this little wager just
go next level to sabotage?

18:31.875 --> 18:35.583
No. I don't think.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.250
No, the tile guy's
really that good.

18:42.083 --> 18:44.375
Is that Jules?

18:44.375 --> 18:45.375
What is he doing?

18:45.375 --> 18:46.667
Lance, I need this spot.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.125
That spot is mine.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.583
Oh, you are not getting
this spot.

18:49.583 --> 18:51.542
Lance, you have to stop.
You have to stop right now.

18:55.125 --> 18:56.375
Ooof!

18:56.375 --> 18:58.792
Oh, so typical of him. Just...

19:01.500 --> 19:02.458
Hey!

19:03.709 --> 19:04.959
Sorry, I couldn't see you.

19:04.959 --> 19:07.875
Yeah, I can't imagine why.

19:07.875 --> 19:10.083
It's alright, we just
touched bumpers.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.458
Well, you should be careful.

19:11.458 --> 19:14.625
It's dangerous having your view
so obstructed.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.875
It's just time management.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.875
I had to get it all in one trip.

19:17.875 --> 19:20.709
Well, it's called scheduling.
Maybe you've heard of it?

19:20.709 --> 19:25.208
And there's the visual aids.
Same old Jules.

19:25.208 --> 19:27.291
Don't need 'em.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.041
Are you sure about that?

19:32.041 --> 19:34.291
Wouldn't want anything
to get missed.

19:34.291 --> 19:35.333
Sure you would.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.709
It'd give you an advantage, right?

19:37.709 --> 19:40.000
If I'm my usual careless self
as you'd like to think of me-

19:40.000 --> 19:41.625
I never used the word
"careless".

19:41.625 --> 19:43.750
I just recall many additional
hardware store trips

19:43.750 --> 19:46.792
as you refused to make lists.

19:46.792 --> 19:48.709
I got it all up here.

19:49.625 --> 19:50.667
Ok, if you insist.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.625
Just trying to be
a good neighbour.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.500
That's touching,
thank you.

19:53.500 --> 19:54.750
I'm ok.

19:54.750 --> 19:55.625
However, if you need
anything-

19:55.625 --> 19:56.625
I don't.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.500
Ok.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.667
- Great.
- Great.

20:06.709 --> 20:08.166
Lance, are you in here?

20:08.166 --> 20:09.583
Richard!

20:09.583 --> 20:12.375
Whew. So, are you gonna have
this place ready for me

20:12.375 --> 20:14.750
to put on the market for you
in three months?

20:14.750 --> 20:18.250
Two, actually.

20:18.250 --> 20:20.875
I may have blurted out an
eight-week turnaround to Jules.

20:20.875 --> 20:23.834
Oh. That seems
totally manageable.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.500
What can I say?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.083
Always up for a little
friendly competition.

20:30.083 --> 20:31.959
You certainly are.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.417
Friendly competition is fine

20:35.417 --> 20:36.625
but I have two other jobs
right now.

20:36.625 --> 20:37.917
You couldn't have given me
more time?

20:37.917 --> 20:39.041
I know, I'm sorry.

20:39.041 --> 20:40.375
It- look, if it's
too much I don't-

20:40.375 --> 20:41.500
No, no, no.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.750
This is just as much
a competition for me

20:42.750 --> 20:44.041
as it is for you.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.375
Waddell Contracting has made
themselves a nice

20:45.375 --> 20:48.375
so I am gonna sell this side
for way more money.

20:48.375 --> 20:51.083
We need to sell this side
for way more money.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.500
We can't be the side
that sells for less.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.000
And she's good.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.083
You know, I took a couple
clients to her last property.

21:00.000 --> 21:04.166
Hey. I was trained by
the great Ed Waddell, alright?

21:04.166 --> 21:06.583
I know exactly what
to do with this place.

21:08.583 --> 21:10.709
You know exactly what
to do with this place.

21:10.709 --> 21:12.166
This is it, Jules.

21:12.166 --> 21:13.667
This is the one that gets you
where you're going

21:13.667 --> 21:15.291
and I am expecting a lot
of work from you

21:15.291 --> 21:18.542
when your empire takes off.

21:18.542 --> 21:19.834
Wow.

21:19.834 --> 21:22.041
I'm gonna have an empire?

21:22.041 --> 21:23.875
Huh.

21:28.375 --> 21:29.542
Hi.

21:29.542 --> 21:30.834
Uh, this is Jules Briggs
and I was wondering

21:30.834 --> 21:32.000
if it's not too late to sign up

21:32.000 --> 21:35.333
for a booth at the Home
and Garden show?

21:35.333 --> 21:37.166
Oh, no, no, not-
not for the nursery,

21:37.166 --> 21:39.250
this would actually be for me.

21:39.250 --> 21:43.959
For Jules Briggs Designs.

21:43.959 --> 21:47.792
Yes, I'll take it.
Thank you.

21:52.125 --> 21:54.166
How did your mom take it,
you leaving the shop?

21:54.166 --> 21:56.875
Well, I'm not leaving yet, I'm
setting the stage so to speak.

21:56.875 --> 21:59.041
I have no idea how long
I'm going to be faking it

21:59.041 --> 22:00.208
'til I'm making it.

22:00.208 --> 22:01.500
Oh, not long at all.

22:01.500 --> 22:02.500
Don't worry about that.

22:02.500 --> 22:04.250
You're already making
great headway.

22:05.333 --> 22:06.208
Is this it?

22:06.208 --> 22:07.041
Mmmhmm.

22:07.041 --> 22:08.250
I love it.

22:08.250 --> 22:09.333
You know what?

22:09.333 --> 22:10.333
None of this would
even be happening

22:10.333 --> 22:12.291
if it weren't for Lance
being back.

22:12.291 --> 22:14.166
Lance? What're
you talking about?

22:14.166 --> 22:15.917
This has nothing
to do with Lance.

22:15.917 --> 22:19.125
I know you two are like night
and day but he challenges you.

22:19.125 --> 22:20.875
He always has.

22:20.875 --> 22:23.625
Well, I guess I felt that
if he had to be right

22:23.625 --> 22:24.750
that meant that I was wrong

22:24.750 --> 22:26.333
and I don't like being told
I'm wrong.

22:26.333 --> 22:29.750
Oh honey, don't I know it?

22:29.750 --> 22:32.250
These are for Eleanor Greene,
she'll be here soon.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.041
I'll put them with the others.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.583
It wasn't only the flip.

22:35.583 --> 22:38.417
It seemed that we were always
on opposite side of things,

22:38.417 --> 22:39.417
you know?

22:39.417 --> 22:41.291
Where to eat, what
movies to see...

22:41.291 --> 22:44.542
Yeah, but that opens you up
to a whole new world.

22:44.542 --> 22:45.458
Well, not in this case.

22:45.458 --> 22:46.542
It doesn't matter.

22:46.542 --> 22:47.709
He's got his side
and I've got mine.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.625
I always thought Lance
was good for you.

22:49.625 --> 22:51.458
Like a motivating force.

22:59.792 --> 23:01.291
Burning the midnight oil?

23:01.291 --> 23:05.000
Yeah, no rest for the weary, not
when there's seven weeks to go.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.417
Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

23:06.417 --> 23:08.834
I figure there's some demoing
I could do at off hours.

23:08.834 --> 23:11.333
You were always good
with a sledgehammer.

23:11.333 --> 23:13.959
Or maybe I was just getting
all my aggression out.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.500
Yeah.

23:18.792 --> 23:21.291
So, the landscaping?

23:21.291 --> 23:23.291
Yeah, I was thinking something
drought resistant,

23:23.291 --> 23:25.625
maybe drip irrigation.

23:25.625 --> 23:29.125
Wait, I- I'm- I'm sorry,
are you joking?

23:29.125 --> 23:30.375
I would never joke
about something

23:30.375 --> 23:32.041
as precious to you as plants.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.625
Drought resistant?

23:33.625 --> 23:35.458
We live in the
Pacific Northwest.

23:35.458 --> 23:37.041
I'm well aware of where
we live, Jules.

23:37.041 --> 23:38.792
It rains every 45 minutes.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.417
Why would you ever wanna go
drought resistant?

23:41.417 --> 23:44.333
Why not try something different?

23:44.333 --> 23:47.000
Because it needs to make sense.

23:47.000 --> 23:50.500
See? Ok, that's so you, thinking
big changes are the answers

23:50.500 --> 23:53.917
instead of looking around to see
what you already have.

23:53.917 --> 23:58.417
Look, I have a lot
at stake here.

23:58.417 --> 24:00.125
So do I.

24:00.125 --> 24:03.125
Yes, but your company
is already established.

24:03.125 --> 24:05.625
My dad is, not me.

24:05.625 --> 24:07.208
I'm not trying to sully
the Waddell name

24:07.208 --> 24:10.834
right before I take it over.

24:10.834 --> 24:13.166
You're taking over?

24:13.166 --> 24:14.250
In Bedford?

24:14.250 --> 24:15.500
Yeah, eventually.

24:15.500 --> 24:18.166
Dad wants to retire.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.667
That's why I have a lot
to lose here, too,

24:19.667 --> 24:22.709
if I don't get this right.

24:22.709 --> 24:25.792
Ok, why don't we just put a pin
in the landscaping conversation

24:25.792 --> 24:26.959
for now.

24:26.959 --> 24:29.458
Just give it some thought
and regroup.

24:29.458 --> 24:30.875
Sounds good to me.

24:30.875 --> 24:32.583
Great.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.417
Now, if you'll excuse me
I need to go destroy

24:34.417 --> 24:35.959
some kitchen cabinets.

24:35.959 --> 24:39.667
Always a favourite pastime
after a conversation with me.

24:46.709 --> 24:48.458
Thanks for helping me
carry these.

24:48.458 --> 24:49.834
Only six weeks left.

24:49.834 --> 24:51.458
I'm gonna be buying these guys
a lot of coffee.

24:51.458 --> 24:52.625
No problem.

24:52.625 --> 24:53.875
I needed the walk this morning.

24:53.875 --> 24:55.208
And we have both been so busy

24:55.208 --> 24:56.625
I feel like I haven't
seen you in a week.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.417
I know. But we're still having
dinner tomorrow night.

24:58.417 --> 24:59.875
I'm making lasagne,
my grandmother's recipe.

24:59.875 --> 25:02.291
Great. Kat and I are so looking
forward to a girl's night.

25:02.291 --> 25:03.917
I know, me too.

25:03.917 --> 25:05.333
Good morning.

25:05.333 --> 25:06.792
Morning.

25:06.792 --> 25:09.834
Heard some pounding coming
from your side last night.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.750
Get some aggression out?

25:11.750 --> 25:12.834
Always.

25:12.834 --> 25:14.583
Thanks for the inspiration.

25:14.583 --> 25:16.667
Any time.

25:18.458 --> 25:19.417
Did you feel that?

25:19.417 --> 25:20.667
Feel what?

25:20.667 --> 25:21.625
The tension.

25:21.625 --> 25:22.750
It's shifting.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.333
Oh, stop it. Nothing's shifting.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.583
I feel the shift.

25:29.750 --> 25:30.959
<i>Hi folks.</i>

25:30.959 --> 25:32.000
<i>Nothing is happening.</i>

25:32.000 --> 25:33.625
<i>Oh, it's happening.</i>

25:36.500 --> 25:37.667
Whoa!

25:37.667 --> 25:39.375
Oh, wow.

25:39.375 --> 25:40.959
Nice progress.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.208
Yeah, you too.

25:42.208 --> 25:43.959
I came in to find the upstairs
wallpaper gone.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.125
Yeah, well I figured

25:45.125 --> 25:46.500
I have to give it some
elbow grease, too.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.667
I have Alan in
the master bathroom

25:47.667 --> 25:48.959
pulling up the linoleum.

25:48.959 --> 25:50.375
Oh, good riddance to that.

25:50.375 --> 25:52.834
The 70's called, even
they don't miss it.

25:54.166 --> 25:55.375
Hey, I need to update you
on some of the finishes

25:55.375 --> 25:56.583
I'm thinking about.

25:56.583 --> 25:58.125
Yeah, sounds good but
it's gonna have to wait.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.417
I have to run down to City Hall
and submit the additional

26:00.417 --> 26:02.125
permit application for
the kitchen expansion.

26:02.125 --> 26:04.000
Hey, I'm going by there
right now to meet a client.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.291
I can drop that off for you.

26:05.291 --> 26:06.500
Oh.

26:06.500 --> 26:08.583
Yeah, that would actually be
really helpful.

26:08.583 --> 26:09.625
Thanks, Terry.

26:09.625 --> 26:10.625
No problem.

26:10.625 --> 26:11.500
And I will see
you tomorrow night.

26:11.500 --> 26:12.583
Yes.

26:12.583 --> 26:13.750
With lasagne.

26:13.750 --> 26:15.500
Yes.

26:19.792 --> 26:20.583
What's next?

26:21.750 --> 26:23.917
You said 10:30.

26:23.917 --> 26:26.917
Ok, ok. I'll just drop this
permit application by City Hall

26:26.917 --> 26:28.834
and I will be there
as soon as I can.

26:28.834 --> 26:31.667
Well, well, well, if it isn't
my favourite realtor.

26:31.667 --> 26:33.041
Oh, besides yourself?

26:33.041 --> 26:34.083
I'm flattered.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.417
You didn't call me back
the other day.

26:35.417 --> 26:36.625
There's a reason for that.

26:36.625 --> 26:37.583
Which is?

26:37.583 --> 26:38.834
I don't wanna talk to you.

26:38.834 --> 26:40.000
Ok, how about this?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.542
I'll take your application
to City Hall.

26:41.542 --> 26:45.208
I'm going right by there and it
sounds like you are in a rush.

26:45.208 --> 26:46.667
I do have a fire to put out.

26:46.667 --> 26:49.000
Let me help.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.041
Thank you.

26:53.333 --> 26:55.458
Hey, I got an idea.

26:55.458 --> 26:58.250
Whoever gets the highest bid
on these duplexes

26:58.250 --> 27:01.834
gets treated to dinner.

27:01.834 --> 27:03.291
Deal.

27:03.291 --> 27:06.125
I know this great little
steak house downtown,

27:06.125 --> 27:08.417
I just hope you can afford it.

27:08.417 --> 27:09.583
Can't wait.

27:13.583 --> 27:15.917
Lance, I'm here!
Let's make some money!

27:18.250 --> 27:21.542
I want these for the drawers

27:21.542 --> 27:23.417
and these for the kitchen cupboards.

27:23.417 --> 27:25.417
Classic. Timeless.

27:25.417 --> 27:27.458
I looked at every conceivable
window covering

27:27.458 --> 27:30.166
from drapes to shades to blinds

27:30.166 --> 27:33.291
and I found myself always
returning to white wood slats.

27:33.291 --> 27:34.917
Simple and elegant.

27:38.166 --> 27:40.709
So I was debating between
a simple white subway tile

27:40.709 --> 27:43.583
or the stacked glass to add
some sparkle but in the end

27:43.583 --> 27:47.125
I decided on tumbled marble
for warmth and texture.

27:47.125 --> 27:48.875
I don't know, Jules.

27:48.875 --> 27:50.125
No, just kidding.

27:50.125 --> 27:51.792
It's perfect.

27:54.583 --> 27:55.917
Hey, Hal

27:55.917 --> 27:58.417
I've got a permit application
to drop off on a rush.

27:58.417 --> 28:00.000
Ok, uh, just leave it with me

28:00.000 --> 28:00.875
and I'll hand it
to the inspector.

28:00.875 --> 28:03.291
Thanks, pal.
Have a good one.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.375
Hey. Uh, yes.

28:15.834 --> 28:17.417
Knock, knock.

28:18.917 --> 28:22.000
Hey. This work
site is off limits.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.375
No scoping out the competition.

28:24.375 --> 28:27.417
As if I need to at this stage
of the game, Jules.

28:27.417 --> 28:29.125
Well, it's not unlike you
to come in here,

28:29.125 --> 28:31.792
look around and get
a bunch of ideas.

28:31.792 --> 28:32.834
This package is for you.

28:32.834 --> 28:34.083
It was delivered to my side.

28:34.083 --> 28:35.291
I'm guessing...

28:36.583 --> 28:37.792
Cabinet hardware.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.709
Handles, maybe knobs.

28:40.709 --> 28:43.166
Mmm. Don't worry about it.

28:43.166 --> 28:44.041
I'm not worried.

28:44.041 --> 28:45.667
Why do you look it?

28:45.667 --> 28:46.583
I look worried?

28:46.583 --> 28:48.041
That's strange, 'cause I'm not.

28:48.041 --> 28:49.500
Really?

28:49.500 --> 28:50.625
Neither am I.

28:50.625 --> 28:51.709
Good.

28:51.709 --> 28:53.333
Great.

28:55.208 --> 28:58.250
I see you knocked down the wall.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.083
Wonder where you
got that idea from.

29:00.083 --> 29:03.333
Ok, don't flatter
yourself, Lance.

29:03.333 --> 29:06.500
Open kitchen and dining room
spaces are everywhere right now.

29:06.500 --> 29:09.208
And it's trend,
I'm not copying you.

29:09.208 --> 29:12.000
Oh, so you're just
copying trend.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.750
No, no. I'm not
copying anything.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.583
I'm just trying to sell a house.

29:16.583 --> 29:18.166
Ok, alright.

29:18.166 --> 29:19.959
Not copying anyone.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.917
If you say so.

29:21.917 --> 29:25.250
Just gonna keep my door locked,
just in case.

29:34.750 --> 29:35.625
Bye, Jules.

29:35.625 --> 29:37.208
Bye.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.291
This is the one.

29:50.291 --> 29:52.625
It's a beautiful floor.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.458
Well, at $5.99 a square foot
seems kinda steep

29:55.458 --> 29:57.917
for manufactured hardwood.

29:57.917 --> 29:59.417
Well, no, that's quality.

29:59.417 --> 30:01.083
Plus, it comes with
a 30-year guarantee,

30:01.083 --> 30:03.625
so for $5.99 that's quite
the bargain.

30:03.625 --> 30:05.875
I could buy it online
for $4.00 a square foot.

30:06.959 --> 30:10.208
Well, then you should probably
do that.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.959
Are you running any specials?

30:11.959 --> 30:14.333
Not this month but uh,
check back in the winter time.

30:14.333 --> 30:15.959
That's our slow season.

30:15.959 --> 30:18.625
Oh. Is your manager around?

30:18.625 --> 30:20.792
You're looking at him,
as of six weeks ago.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.250
Oh, well my name is Jules.

30:22.250 --> 30:24.417
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

30:24.417 --> 30:26.375
I'm Lance Waddell, Waddell
Contracting and Renovation.

30:26.375 --> 30:27.542
Oh, sure.

30:27.542 --> 30:29.542
Yeah, we all know your dad
around here.

30:29.542 --> 30:30.291
That's right.

30:30.291 --> 30:31.750
So she and I are together.

30:33.041 --> 30:34.667
No. We're not.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.000
Uh, give me one second.

30:37.917 --> 30:39.709
Jules, will you go
with me on this?

30:39.709 --> 30:41.375
No, I'm not some
damsel in distress.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.375
I know that but I know how
these guys feel about my dad.

30:44.375 --> 30:45.583
I'm gonna get us a discount.

30:45.583 --> 30:48.083
Yeah. That's exactly
what I was about to do.

30:48.083 --> 30:49.792
Ok, well-

30:49.792 --> 30:50.709
Sorry about that.

30:50.709 --> 30:52.250
No worries.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.792
So look, we're flipping this
house over on Holland Avenue,

30:54.792 --> 30:57.208
together, and we just wanted
to get some flooring

30:57.208 --> 30:58.875
from our favourite guys.

30:58.875 --> 31:00.750
Oh, we appreciate the vote of
confidence from you

31:00.750 --> 31:02.333
and your dad.

31:02.333 --> 31:04.041
Of course.

31:04.041 --> 31:06.458
Are you guys still
offering that 10 percent
contractor's discount?

31:06.458 --> 31:08.583
That expired a few
months back but uh,

31:08.583 --> 31:10.000
I think I can give it to you.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.041
<i>Right.</i>

31:11.041 --> 31:13.583
It's because of
his repeat business.

31:13.583 --> 31:14.917
Well, no, she also-

31:14.917 --> 31:16.625
I may not be a contractor
but I do have

31:16.625 --> 31:19.208
my own design company,
Jules Briggs Designs,

31:19.208 --> 31:20.750
I don't know if
you've heard of it,

31:20.750 --> 31:22.875
and not only have I bought
flooring here before

31:22.875 --> 31:25.625
for my last two properties,
I also referred my cousin,

31:25.625 --> 31:28.166
my neighbour, and
my optometrist here.

31:28.166 --> 31:30.208
I'm sure it's all noted if you
check your computer.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.917
Now, I don't know about you

31:31.917 --> 31:34.542
but I think that qualifies
as repeat business

31:34.542 --> 31:38.291
so I will happily accept
that 10 percent discount
as well.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.709
Uh, sure.

31:39.709 --> 31:41.583
Um, I think I can get
you approved as well.

31:41.583 --> 31:43.333
Plus, we can save
on delivery charges

31:43.333 --> 31:46.417
since it's all going to the same
address, correct?

31:46.417 --> 31:49.000
I'll put you on one invoice so
there's a single delivery fee.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.041
Perfect.

31:52.333 --> 31:55.291
Well, I think that grown man is
legitimately frightened of you.

31:55.291 --> 31:56.583
Well done.

31:56.583 --> 31:59.625
See? I've done a few of these
since you and I-

31:59.625 --> 32:01.166
well, I know how to take
care of myself.

32:01.166 --> 32:02.750
I never said you didn't, Jules.

32:02.750 --> 32:06.917
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
need to go pick some flooring.

32:06.917 --> 32:09.375
You don't know which one
you're getting yet?

32:09.375 --> 32:12.709
I'm gonna wander the aisles
and see which one speaks to me

32:12.709 --> 32:14.583
as a person, you know?

32:16.875 --> 32:18.583
Half an hour would be great.

32:18.583 --> 32:20.625
Yeah, I just got held up
at the flooring store

32:20.625 --> 32:23.083
and some other errands.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.250
Uh huh, yeah, yeah, I'm taking
my grandmother's lasagne

32:25.250 --> 32:27.166
out of the oven as we speak.

32:27.166 --> 32:28.458
<i>Price-check
on register 3.</i>

32:28.458 --> 32:30.959
I gotta go. See you at 7:00

32:30.959 --> 32:33.834
Grandmother's lasagne, huh?

32:33.834 --> 32:35.500
Are you following me?

32:37.709 --> 32:39.250
No, I ran out of coffee.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.625
Unacceptable with my crew,

32:40.625 --> 32:42.333
and this is the nearest
grocery store.

32:42.333 --> 32:44.500
Is your grandmother,
Betty Homemaker?

32:44.500 --> 32:48.083
I had every intention of
actually cooking a lasagne

32:48.083 --> 32:49.542
for tonight.

32:49.542 --> 32:52.083
But burning the candle at
both ends made that problematic.

32:52.083 --> 32:55.000
I'm on like my third candle
of the day.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.333
Want some advice?

32:56.333 --> 32:58.917
If I said no would
you still give it?

32:58.917 --> 33:00.083
Yep.

33:00.083 --> 33:01.250
Go with that one.

33:01.250 --> 33:04.041
It's cheesier. The tomato sauce
is better.

33:04.041 --> 33:05.542
What?

33:05.542 --> 33:07.125
I'm a bachelor now.

33:07.125 --> 33:08.834
One of those things
will last me a while.

33:08.834 --> 33:10.709
I bought five of them
when they were on sale.

33:10.709 --> 33:12.625
I'm good 'til summer.

33:12.625 --> 33:17.959
Oh, so you're gonna be here
until summer?

33:17.959 --> 33:19.458
Why would you ask that?

33:19.458 --> 33:24.959
I don't know, I guess it's
because you've left before.

33:24.959 --> 33:27.458
I know.

33:27.458 --> 33:29.834
I'm thinking of setting down
some roots.

33:29.834 --> 33:31.875
My opportunity seems
to be here.

33:31.875 --> 33:33.417
Things weren't so great
in Portland,

33:33.417 --> 33:34.917
I tried.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.542
I wasn't the one-man show
that I thought I'd be.

33:36.542 --> 33:39.458
Just ended up working on
a crew there.

33:39.458 --> 33:42.375
A lot of competition
for contractors.

33:42.375 --> 33:45.834
I'm sorry, I- I didn't
realize that.

33:45.834 --> 33:47.834
I don't advertise it.

33:47.834 --> 33:51.208
Just like you don't advertise
serving frozen lasagne.

33:51.208 --> 33:52.458
Ha. Well, speaking of,

33:52.458 --> 33:57.000
I do need to go put that
in the oven like, now.

33:57.000 --> 33:58.583
You never saw me.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.667
My lips are sealed.

34:14.000 --> 34:15.458
I love it out here.
It's so relaxing.

34:15.458 --> 34:16.458
Yeah, isn't it?

34:16.458 --> 34:19.959
This is so good.

34:19.959 --> 34:22.291
But it reminds me of something.

34:22.291 --> 34:24.208
I know. What does it taste like?

34:24.208 --> 34:26.500
I can't quite put my finger
on it but it tastes like...

34:26.500 --> 34:28.417
Ok, ok, it tastes like
store bought

34:28.417 --> 34:30.041
because it is store bought!

34:31.583 --> 34:34.458
I'm so sorry that I tried to
pass it off as my grandmother's.

34:34.458 --> 34:36.917
It's just- I'm so tapped out,
you guys.

34:36.917 --> 34:38.458
Ok, first of all,
we're not mad.

34:38.458 --> 34:39.834
Are you mad?

34:39.834 --> 34:41.458
No, not at all.

34:41.458 --> 34:44.291
And second of all, there's
no such thing as bad lasagne.

34:44.291 --> 34:46.375
I'm sure your grandma's recipe
is amazing,

34:46.375 --> 34:48.834
but we can take a rain cheque
until the flip

34:48.834 --> 34:51.417
and the Home and Garden show
are all over with.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.750
Thank you.

34:52.750 --> 34:53.875
I know, and I have to start
getting things ready

34:53.875 --> 34:55.166
for the booth.

34:55.166 --> 34:56.583
We set up next week.

34:56.583 --> 34:57.709
Yeah, I'll have my booth there,
too, so I can help you.

34:57.709 --> 34:59.250
And I have plenty of staff
at the cafe

34:59.250 --> 35:01.750
so I can cover at the booth
while you're at the job site.

35:01.750 --> 35:04.083
I really appreciate it,
you guys.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.166
And Terry's right.

35:05.166 --> 35:06.375
There's no such thing
as bad lasagne.

35:07.417 --> 35:09.417
Lance said this was
the best one.

35:09.417 --> 35:10.667
Lance?

35:10.667 --> 35:11.959
Oh, Lance said that?

35:11.959 --> 35:13.959
- Huh.
- Interesting.

35:13.959 --> 35:15.333
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.375
It wasn't like that.

35:17.375 --> 35:20.709
We just ran into each other
at the grocery store.

35:20.709 --> 35:21.959
Huh.

35:21.959 --> 35:24.500
Very nice.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.667
You know, he was talking about
settling down roots in Bedford.

35:27.667 --> 35:28.750
With you?

35:28.750 --> 35:30.667
No, not with me.

35:30.667 --> 35:33.291
Listen, I've heard this before
from him.

35:33.291 --> 35:35.291
I thought it was forever
between us but,

35:35.291 --> 35:37.750
you know, he had
a different idea.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.083
I doubt he's changed
that much.

35:40.083 --> 35:41.709
But you hope so?

35:41.709 --> 35:44.250
No.

35:44.250 --> 35:46.625
I don't know.

35:46.625 --> 35:49.458
What I do know is that this
flip could give me the means

35:49.458 --> 35:51.875
to establish myself as
a full-time designer

35:51.875 --> 35:55.041
and that's where my focus
should be right now.

35:55.041 --> 35:57.417
Well, cheers to that, sister.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.834
Wow!

36:06.834 --> 36:08.792
This is even bigger
than last year.

36:08.917 --> 36:09.959
Yeah.

36:09.959 --> 36:11.500
Are you in the South Pavilion
with me?

36:11.500 --> 36:13.250
West Pavilion with my mom.

36:13.250 --> 36:15.208
Ok. Looks like we're going
that way.

36:19.917 --> 36:21.750
This convention is really
gonna help your career,

36:21.750 --> 36:23.125
trust me.

36:23.125 --> 36:24.750
After last year my business
has never been better.

36:24.750 --> 36:25.709
Oh, I hope so.

36:25.709 --> 36:26.709
Oh, yeah.

36:26.709 --> 36:28.166
Oh, hello ladies.

36:28.166 --> 36:29.125
Richard.

36:29.125 --> 36:30.542
Three weeks to go, Terry.

36:30.542 --> 36:31.834
I'm feeling optimistic.

36:33.083 --> 36:34.542
I wouldn't hold your breath.

36:34.542 --> 36:36.667
See you soon.

36:42.041 --> 36:43.333
So this is me.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.959
Great.

36:50.583 --> 36:52.250
Forever my neighbour.

36:52.250 --> 36:55.709
Can't get away
from me if you tried.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.417
Excuse me?

36:59.417 --> 37:02.333
Excuse me, could I talk
to the two of you?

37:02.333 --> 37:04.125
Some people over there were
talking about

37:04.125 --> 37:08.792
your duelling duplex so I just
had to come see this for myself.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.417
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

37:10.417 --> 37:11.500
I'm Elsie Baxter.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.875
Hi.

37:12.875 --> 37:14.083
Features editor of Innovative
Designs magazine.

37:14.083 --> 37:15.417
We put on this event.

37:15.417 --> 37:16.792
Oh, I read your
magazine all the time.

37:16.792 --> 37:18.166
Oh.

37:18.166 --> 37:19.583
Yeah, we actually
advertise in it.

37:19.583 --> 37:20.875
Not bad for a regional
magazine, right?

37:20.875 --> 37:22.792
No, this event is great
for local businesses.

37:22.792 --> 37:24.917
My mom's nursery has
been involved for years.

37:24.917 --> 37:27.417
Are you familiar with our
feature 'This Month's Flip'?

37:27.417 --> 37:28.709
It's the best.

37:28.709 --> 37:29.917
I love it.

37:29.917 --> 37:33.375
So what if we really made
this a competition

37:33.375 --> 37:35.542
with a vote on the last day
of the show.

37:35.542 --> 37:38.667
Attendees get to choose their
favourite side of the duplex

37:38.667 --> 37:45.000
and the winner gets to be This
Month's Flip for next month?

37:45.000 --> 37:46.542
Ok, well that sounds incredible

37:46.542 --> 37:50.208
but that would only give us
another eight days to finish.

37:50.208 --> 37:52.583
We were counting on
about twice that.

37:52.583 --> 37:53.792
Right.

37:53.792 --> 37:55.417
I can do it.

37:57.583 --> 38:00.500
Well then, so can I.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.875
Wonderful.

38:01.875 --> 38:04.375
I'm going to talk to my team
and make arrangements.

38:04.375 --> 38:06.041
Ok, bye.

38:06.041 --> 38:07.834
Huh.

38:07.834 --> 38:09.792
Look at you bending.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.417
This is crazy, you know?

38:16.417 --> 38:17.500
We're crazy.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.667
Speak for yourself.

38:18.667 --> 38:19.709
I think we can do it.

38:19.709 --> 38:21.709
It's the same job,
just accelerated.

38:21.709 --> 38:23.291
How did a simple little wager
between us

38:23.291 --> 38:25.834
become a potential
magazine spread?

38:25.834 --> 38:27.375
Don't forget the
online exposure.

38:27.375 --> 38:29.083
Right, how could I?

38:29.083 --> 38:30.208
Come on, get your head
in the game.

38:30.208 --> 38:32.208
My dad and I spent a lot
on advertising

38:32.208 --> 38:34.166
and this kind of publicity
is priceless.

38:34.166 --> 38:37.083
Yeah, but breaking the news
to Kenny's gonna cost me a ton.

38:37.083 --> 38:39.041
Yeah, I don't envy you
on that one.

38:39.041 --> 38:40.750
Eight days isn't a lot
but I'm choosing to focus

38:40.750 --> 38:43.542
on the benefits, you know?
For when I win.

38:43.542 --> 38:47.291
Yeah, me too.
For when I win.

38:47.291 --> 38:48.583
Eight days, Jules?

38:48.583 --> 38:50.083
You know I really needed
every single day.

38:50.083 --> 38:52.000
I know, but I spoke to my mother
and she's gonna have

38:52.000 --> 38:53.417
some of her friends help her
at the shop.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.041
I am on this flip 24/7.

38:55.041 --> 38:57.375
That'll help out some and I can
get a rush on the cabinets

38:57.375 --> 38:58.542
but it's gonna cost you.

38:58.542 --> 39:00.291
I know. I'll dip into savings.

39:00.291 --> 39:01.875
This could really get
our names out there.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.125
Well, eight days.

39:03.125 --> 39:03.959
Let's get to work.

39:03.959 --> 39:05.000
Yeah.

39:06.166 --> 39:07.959
So look, I'm repurposing this
old door

39:07.959 --> 39:09.458
and turning it
into a bookshelf.

39:09.458 --> 39:11.458
Kinda like I did
with this crib swing.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.000
What do you think?

39:13.000 --> 39:15.083
Oh yeah, your mom used to sit
and read in this for hours.

39:15.083 --> 39:16.917
Hey, you should put this in
the back yard of the duplex.

39:16.917 --> 39:19.750
It might help with
the sale.

39:19.750 --> 39:22.792
Nah. Then they'll expect
it to come with the house.

39:25.542 --> 39:29.417
So... only eight more days.

39:29.417 --> 39:31.792
I'm afraid so, but
I'm gonna get it done.

39:31.792 --> 39:34.333
After all, this is Waddell
Contracting and Renovations

39:34.333 --> 39:35.625
we're talking about here.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.208
Aha!

39:37.208 --> 39:39.834
That's how I know I'm leaving
this business in capable hands.

39:39.834 --> 39:43.291
Let's not over shoot, pop.
I'm not done yet.

39:43.291 --> 39:45.750
But if I do get this right
I think this duplex

39:45.750 --> 39:47.208
will put me on the map.

39:47.208 --> 39:49.041
We're already on the map.

39:49.041 --> 39:50.792
No, you're on the map.

39:50.792 --> 39:52.166
Once this business is just me

39:52.166 --> 39:55.500
I wanna make sure
people are ok with that.

39:55.500 --> 39:57.834
I did everything I could to try
to find contracting work

39:57.834 --> 40:00.667
in Portland but guys like me
are a dime a dozen out there.

40:00.667 --> 40:03.625
You wanna hear about
my first solo jobs?

40:03.625 --> 40:05.500
Because it's not pretty.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.333
Pop, can I just grow up to be
half as good as you?

40:08.333 --> 40:10.500
What're you talking about?

40:10.500 --> 40:12.667
You're better.

40:12.667 --> 40:14.625
Of course you may wanna get
in good with the town

40:14.625 --> 40:16.667
if you want them to vote
your way

40:16.667 --> 40:18.500
and Jules is very well-liked
around here.

40:18.500 --> 40:20.542
You've been gone
a couple years.

40:20.542 --> 40:22.959
I guess it is kind of
a popularity contest, huh?

40:22.959 --> 40:24.417
It can be.

40:24.417 --> 40:26.250
And you're the face
of this project.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.750
You need to show your face.

40:28.750 --> 40:30.542
Yeah.

40:35.291 --> 40:36.166
<i>Hey, Lance.</i>

40:36.166 --> 40:37.166
Hi Kat, how are you?

40:37.166 --> 40:38.709
<i>Good. What can I get for you?</i>

40:38.709 --> 40:40.166
Iced tea to go, please.

40:40.166 --> 40:41.917
Alright.

40:41.917 --> 40:44.375
Just out and about
seeing the people.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.583
On a break from the duplex,
which is going great,

40:46.583 --> 40:48.166
by the way.

40:48.166 --> 40:49.208
Hi, ladies.

40:50.667 --> 40:52.834
Wow. Very subtle.

40:52.834 --> 40:55.375
Oh, hi Jules,
didn't see you there.

40:55.375 --> 40:58.083
Just be yourself.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.333
Interesting advice

40:59.333 --> 41:02.709
seeing as you're not such
a big fan of myself.

41:02.709 --> 41:06.417
Nah, you're ok, when you listen
to what I have to say.

41:11.125 --> 41:13.333
Hey Lance, you collect
old wood, right?

41:13.333 --> 41:15.792
Do you want the picnic tables
out back?

41:15.792 --> 41:17.250
Oh, you're getting rid
of those?

41:17.250 --> 41:19.083
Yeah, they're so old and
every time people sit on them

41:19.083 --> 41:21.041
they just get splinters.

41:21.041 --> 41:22.375
Well hey, anything
can get restored.

41:22.375 --> 41:23.792
Why don't I sand them for ya?

41:23.792 --> 41:25.458
Throw a stain on them?

41:25.458 --> 41:27.709
Really? You- you would do that?

41:27.709 --> 41:29.041
Yeah, happy to.

41:29.041 --> 41:31.125
That way you can keep them
out there.

41:31.125 --> 41:34.500
Yeah, I mean, that would
be great if you don't mind.

41:34.500 --> 41:35.959
I mean, of course I wouldn't
expect you to do it

41:35.959 --> 41:37.417
'til after the show.

41:37.417 --> 41:40.083
I'll get on it as soon
as I'm done.

41:40.083 --> 41:43.000
Great. Thank you, Lance.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.709
I like him.

41:52.917 --> 41:53.959
Better?

41:53.959 --> 41:56.333
Exponentially.

41:56.333 --> 41:57.709
Good.

41:57.709 --> 41:59.417
Goodbye, ladies.

42:04.166 --> 42:06.500
What?

42:12.834 --> 42:14.083
Hey, Jules?

42:14.083 --> 42:15.125
We still need a permit
for the kitchen expansion.

42:15.125 --> 42:16.291
Have you heard anything?

42:16.291 --> 42:17.458
No, but I'll call and check
on the status.

42:17.458 --> 42:18.667
Ok.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.542
Hey, yeah. No, it should
be on its way soon.

42:20.542 --> 42:23.917
<i>Lance, It's so good to see you.</i>

42:23.917 --> 42:26.917
<i>Naomi, what are you doing here?</i>

42:26.917 --> 42:28.959
<i>Don't worry, I'm here to help.</i>

42:30.583 --> 42:32.917
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

42:32.917 --> 42:36.500
Honestly though, Lance,
you should listen to me now.

42:36.500 --> 42:37.959
Right.

42:37.959 --> 42:40.250
<i>I could do a lot
with this yard?</i>

42:40.250 --> 42:45.208
Come on now, Lance, admit it.
You need me.

42:45.208 --> 42:46.625
Great!

42:46.625 --> 42:48.542
Alan, here you are.

42:48.542 --> 42:50.959
I uh, I was standing here
waiting for you and,

42:50.959 --> 42:52.875
well, there you are.
Well done.

42:52.875 --> 42:54.041
Oh, hi.

42:54.041 --> 42:57.291
Um, I was just here waiting
for Alan.

42:57.291 --> 42:58.500
Ok.

42:58.500 --> 43:00.208
Jules, this is uh, Naomi.

43:00.208 --> 43:00.875
She's a-

43:00.875 --> 43:01.959
His ex.

43:01.959 --> 43:04.917
<i>Landscape architect.
Also my ex.</i>

43:04.917 --> 43:07.917
We dated for a bit in Portland.
Until she broke up with me.

43:07.917 --> 43:10.542
I would say a year is a little
more than a bit, Lance.

43:10.542 --> 43:11.792
Right.

43:11.792 --> 43:13.208
Ok.

43:13.208 --> 43:15.542
We met on a job site, you
know, the old fairy tale.

43:15.542 --> 43:17.834
Landscaping is not
his strong suit.

43:17.834 --> 43:20.834
So, when I heard about
the competition

43:20.834 --> 43:21.959
on the Innovative
Design website,

43:21.959 --> 43:24.000
I had to come to his rescue.

43:26.875 --> 43:28.083
Well, it's good to meet you.

43:28.083 --> 43:30.166
Right.

43:30.166 --> 43:32.208
Oh, I'm sorry, I was painting.

43:35.417 --> 43:37.750
You can use my shirt.

43:37.750 --> 43:39.417
Thanks.

43:41.834 --> 43:45.208
So we should definitely talk
about the yard.

43:45.208 --> 43:48.667
Well, Jules is experienced
in landscaping, as well.

43:48.667 --> 43:49.959
Oh.

43:49.959 --> 43:55.667
Both of you are both
very good at landscaping.

43:55.667 --> 43:56.583
Well, I love it.

43:56.583 --> 43:57.458
I love doing it.

43:57.458 --> 43:59.917
I love doing it, too.

43:59.917 --> 44:01.542
Ok, I think that uh...

44:01.542 --> 44:04.750
Yeah, I think I'm gonna
go back to painting.

44:04.750 --> 44:07.542
And uh- Oh, um, it's so good
to meet you.

44:07.542 --> 44:09.125
So great.

44:10.458 --> 44:12.125
Great.

44:13.667 --> 44:15.625
Alan?!

44:15.625 --> 44:17.166
Ok. Ok, thank you.

44:17.166 --> 44:19.500
Please let me know as
soon as you find out.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.166
I'm just running
out of time here.

44:22.166 --> 44:24.250
Ok, thanks.

44:24.250 --> 44:25.375
What was that?

44:25.375 --> 44:27.625
They can't find our permit application.

44:27.625 --> 44:29.667
This has never happened
to me before.

44:29.667 --> 44:30.792
I- I'm sure it's down there.

44:30.792 --> 44:32.250
You know how disorganized
they can be.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.041
Yeah, but still.

44:34.041 --> 44:35.417
Well, we're gonna need
that permit

44:35.417 --> 44:36.959
before an inspector shows up.

44:36.959 --> 44:38.083
I know.

44:38.083 --> 44:40.083
And we can't afford
any more problems.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.875
I'm just digging up the old,
I'm not replacing anything.

44:50.875 --> 44:52.250
I wouldn't wanna make
any decisions

44:52.250 --> 44:54.375
without Naomi weighing in.

44:54.375 --> 44:56.792
I didn't ask her to come here.

44:56.792 --> 44:59.542
And yet she still did.

44:59.542 --> 45:01.625
Look, we don't need
a second opinion.

45:01.625 --> 45:03.000
I've got this.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.667
I know.

45:04.667 --> 45:06.417
Anyway, I told her that.

45:06.417 --> 45:08.709
So that's that?

45:08.709 --> 45:11.166
Yeah, that's that.

45:11.166 --> 45:12.500
Hey, Jimmy, are we rolling?

45:12.500 --> 45:13.750
Ok.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.959
Don't mind us, we just wanna get
a little footage

45:15.959 --> 45:18.500
to put on the Innovative
Designs website.

45:18.500 --> 45:22.291
We're expanding our website
with video features now.

45:22.291 --> 45:25.000
Oh, we won't give anything away
before the big reveal

45:25.000 --> 45:26.792
but it'll get people
to come to the show.

45:26.792 --> 45:30.375
Make sure you get the front
of both sides separately, yeah?

45:30.375 --> 45:32.208
I would love to get an
interview with you as well,

45:32.208 --> 45:34.667
just something short and sweet
if you don't mind.

45:34.667 --> 45:36.000
Well I'm kind of a mess, I-

45:36.000 --> 45:37.375
Oh, even better.

45:37.375 --> 45:38.834
You're in the trenches
digging in the dirt,

45:38.834 --> 45:40.583
getting it done.

45:40.583 --> 45:42.583
But you look good doing it.

45:44.709 --> 45:47.750
And welcome to the special
Innovative Designs feature

45:47.750 --> 45:51.083
that we're calling
"Two Sides, One Coin".

45:51.083 --> 45:53.792
This challenge pits contractor
Lance Waddell

45:53.792 --> 45:58.250
against local florist slash
house designer, Jules Briggs.

45:58.250 --> 46:00.333
Each is in the process
of renovating

46:00.333 --> 46:03.208
one side of this duplex
and you get to vote online

46:03.208 --> 46:04.458
to choose your favourite.

46:04.458 --> 46:06.000
The lucky winner will be
featured as

46:06.000 --> 46:08.041
This Month's Flip next issue.

46:08.041 --> 46:10.542
Jules, tell us
about your vision.

46:10.542 --> 46:13.875
Well, I'm going for a modern
farmhouse design

46:13.875 --> 46:16.291
with a contemporary
cozy aesthetic.

46:16.291 --> 46:18.792
Warm and light and soft,

46:18.792 --> 46:20.709
and because I personally
love flowers

46:20.709 --> 46:22.792
there will be floral touches
throughout, as well.

46:22.792 --> 46:24.083
Oh, charming.

46:24.083 --> 46:26.417
And what about you, Lance?

46:26.417 --> 46:28.709
Well, I like approachable
industrial design

46:28.709 --> 46:31.542
that celebrates natural
materials, earthy colours,

46:31.542 --> 46:34.709
and the elimination
of unnecessary detail.

46:34.709 --> 46:37.917
Well, we've always had very
different takes on aesthetics.

46:37.917 --> 46:41.917
So you've done this sort of
competition thing before?

46:41.917 --> 46:43.166
No.

46:43.166 --> 46:45.375
Well, once we flipped
a house together

46:45.375 --> 46:47.792
but we're not together anymore.

46:47.792 --> 46:50.667
But you were once together,
like, together together?

46:54.500 --> 46:56.792
A very long time ago, yeah?

46:56.792 --> 47:01.750
So this is a little more than
just a professional rivalry.

47:01.750 --> 47:02.834
No.

47:02.834 --> 47:03.792
No, no, no.

47:03.792 --> 47:05.125
This is strictly professional.

47:05.125 --> 47:06.166
Definitely.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.583
It's professional.

47:07.583 --> 47:10.375
And the plot thickens.

47:10.375 --> 47:11.959
And there you have it, folks.

47:11.959 --> 47:14.041
Personal or professional?

47:14.041 --> 47:17.083
On the last day of Innovative
Designs Home and Garden show

47:17.083 --> 47:19.041
we will be revealing
the finished product

47:19.041 --> 47:22.458
and you will get to decide
who the big winner is.

47:22.458 --> 47:24.542
Will it be Jules Briggs?

47:24.542 --> 47:26.625
Uh, yes. I'm going to beat him.

47:26.625 --> 47:29.875
Or Lance Waddell?

47:29.875 --> 47:32.000
You can bet on it.

47:32.000 --> 47:34.542
And cut.

47:34.542 --> 47:36.291
You guys were great.

47:41.959 --> 47:44.125
When we start it, Mike, it'll be
over in like five minutes.

47:44.125 --> 47:46.625
Thanks, buddy.

47:46.625 --> 47:49.083
Hey.

47:49.083 --> 47:50.542
I uh, was wondering if you can
take a look at something?

47:50.542 --> 47:52.917
Come on in.
What is it?

47:52.917 --> 47:54.250
It's plans for the front.

47:54.250 --> 47:56.083
I'm guessing now that you told
Naomi to get lost

47:56.083 --> 48:01.333
you trust me when it comes
to the landscaping.

48:01.333 --> 48:03.375
Let me take a look
before I commit.

48:07.375 --> 48:10.250
So what's the deal with
that Naomi, anyway?

48:10.250 --> 48:12.250
What do you mean?

48:12.250 --> 48:16.208
I just... I don't know,
I don't see you with her.

48:16.208 --> 48:18.834
Well, that's probably why
I'm not with her.

48:18.834 --> 48:22.000
I thought you said she broke
up with you.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.208
Well, look who's
paying attention.

48:25.208 --> 48:27.959
So, the plans,
what do you think?

48:27.959 --> 48:32.291
I don't wanna make any decisions
without you.

48:32.291 --> 48:33.625
Well, let me run it by Naomi.

48:33.625 --> 48:35.041
She might have some thoughts,
you know.

48:35.041 --> 48:37.125
She is a professional-
Jules, it's a joke.

48:37.125 --> 48:40.166
No, yeah, I know.
You are not funny.

48:40.166 --> 48:41.458
I'm a little bit funny.

48:41.458 --> 48:43.333
Are you, though?

48:48.625 --> 48:49.458
What're you doing?

48:49.458 --> 48:50.959
You can't paint in the rain.

48:50.959 --> 48:52.333
Just sampling some colours.

48:52.333 --> 48:53.917
I wanted to get your thoughts.

48:53.917 --> 48:57.375
Don't say anything
until you've taken a look.

48:59.875 --> 49:00.917
What is that?

49:00.917 --> 49:03.000
Does that colour
even have a name?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.709
This is the colour blue.

49:04.709 --> 49:06.000
It's interesting.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.041
Is it, though?

49:07.041 --> 49:08.500
I mean, take a good long
look at it.

49:08.500 --> 49:10.959
I mean- maybe rethink it.

49:10.959 --> 49:14.458
Ok, would you consider
a sophisticated grey?

49:14.458 --> 49:15.458
Let's see.

49:15.458 --> 49:17.667
Boring, dull, uninspired grey.

49:17.667 --> 49:18.709
What would that look like?

49:18.709 --> 49:20.583
Fine. A grey-ish blue.

49:20.583 --> 49:22.125
It's a combination of both.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.667
We could split the difference.

49:23.667 --> 49:28.125
Grey says harmony,
balance and growth.

49:28.125 --> 49:29.458
You're kidding, right?

49:29.458 --> 49:30.291
What?

49:30.291 --> 49:32.250
Colours have meaning.

49:32.250 --> 49:35.125
The flooring is here.

49:35.125 --> 49:36.667
Nice.

49:36.667 --> 49:38.125
Hi.

49:38.125 --> 49:40.250
I've got a delivery
for Jules Briggs.

49:40.250 --> 49:41.125
Yes, that's me.

49:41.125 --> 49:42.542
Is that for both orders?

49:42.542 --> 49:44.583
It's one invoice, but the
boxes are clearly marked.

49:44.583 --> 49:45.709
Great.

49:45.709 --> 49:46.875
Well, you can place them inside.

49:46.875 --> 49:48.041
Unit A is on the left,
B is on the right.

49:48.041 --> 49:48.959
Ok. I just need your signature.

49:48.959 --> 49:51.417
Of course.

49:51.417 --> 49:52.625
Thanks.

49:52.625 --> 49:53.750
And that's for you.

49:53.750 --> 49:55.500
Great, thank you.

49:58.834 --> 49:59.792
Look.

50:01.083 --> 50:04.709
See, see, this family
is soft and inviting.

50:04.709 --> 50:08.208
And this is cool and welcoming.
What's your point?

50:08.208 --> 50:11.333
Well, my point is we want it
to say something.

50:11.333 --> 50:13.750
And what exactly do we want it
to say, Jules?

50:13.750 --> 50:15.875
I'm so hungry.

50:15.875 --> 50:17.500
Strange thing to say.

50:17.500 --> 50:20.583
No, like I- I literally haven't
had a bite to eat all day.

50:20.583 --> 50:21.917
You just gotta keep up better.

50:21.917 --> 50:24.834
I'm trying. You're a little
all over the place.

50:24.834 --> 50:27.542
Maybe a little hangry, too?

50:27.542 --> 50:30.041
Remember our rule?

50:30.041 --> 50:32.125
No decisions on
an empty stomach

50:32.125 --> 50:33.583
Exactly.

50:33.583 --> 50:34.959
No more colour talk

50:34.959 --> 50:37.458
until your blood sugar level
stabilizes, alright?

50:37.458 --> 50:39.583
Come on, I gotta go back to the
shop anyway to get some stuff.

50:39.583 --> 50:41.083
We'll get food on the way.

50:41.083 --> 50:42.750
Alright, let me tell Kenny
to start installing the floors.

50:42.750 --> 50:43.792
Alright.

50:49.375 --> 50:51.000
You were right.
I needed this.

50:51.000 --> 50:52.417
I am no longer hangry.

50:52.417 --> 50:55.750
I am full-tent.

50:55.750 --> 50:56.667
What is that?

50:56.667 --> 50:58.041
Full and content?

50:58.041 --> 50:59.083
Uh...

50:59.083 --> 51:00.083
No? Doesn't work?

51:00.083 --> 51:01.250
I don't think
that's gonna stick.

51:01.250 --> 51:02.542
Hmm.

51:07.834 --> 51:11.417
This is relaxing. Meditative.

51:11.417 --> 51:13.125
In fact, I think this might be
the first time

51:13.125 --> 51:15.291
I've relaxed in a month.

51:15.291 --> 51:17.166
We'll all get some sleep
when this is over.

51:17.166 --> 51:18.458
Just a couple more days.

51:18.458 --> 51:20.083
You know, winning is
the furthest thing away

51:20.083 --> 51:21.458
from my mind right now?

51:21.458 --> 51:23.750
I just want it to be good.
And done.

51:23.750 --> 51:25.709
It's gonna be great, Jules.

51:25.709 --> 51:29.417
You really do have a knack
for this.

51:29.417 --> 51:31.250
Hmph.

51:31.250 --> 51:33.125
Yeah, I think that's the
only thing I ever wanted

51:33.125 --> 51:35.959
to hear from you back then.

51:35.959 --> 51:38.792
That I was good at this.

51:38.792 --> 51:39.500
I never said it?

51:39.500 --> 51:40.792
Mmm-mmm.

51:40.792 --> 51:43.917
No. I thought it.

51:43.917 --> 51:46.208
I thought it a lot.

51:46.208 --> 51:52.458
I thought- well, I think
the same thing about you.

51:52.458 --> 51:55.000
And this swing you made
for your mom?

51:55.000 --> 51:55.917
It's incredible.

51:55.917 --> 51:58.333
You turned this crib into this.

51:58.333 --> 51:59.625
You know, you could sell this.

51:59.625 --> 52:02.166
No, I'm not gonna sell this.

52:02.166 --> 52:03.709
This was hers.

52:03.709 --> 52:05.333
I understand.

52:07.250 --> 52:09.709
You know, I kept that barrel
you turned into a wine rack.

52:09.709 --> 52:10.625
You kept that?

52:10.625 --> 52:11.959
- Mmmhmm.
- Really?

52:11.959 --> 52:13.458
- Mmmhmm.
- After everything?

52:13.458 --> 52:16.500
Well, I contemplated selling
it because I was mad at you,

52:16.500 --> 52:18.125
but I needed somewhere
to put my wine.

52:19.792 --> 52:21.792
Right.

52:21.792 --> 52:23.667
What you do is art.

52:23.667 --> 52:24.667
I'm a contractor, Jules.

52:24.667 --> 52:27.417
I'm not an artist.

52:27.417 --> 52:29.625
Why can't you be both?

52:29.625 --> 52:31.542
'Cause it's not
what we do at Waddell.

52:31.542 --> 52:34.208
We buy properties,
we renovate 'em.

52:34.208 --> 52:36.041
We.

52:36.041 --> 52:38.875
But what about
when it's just you?

52:38.875 --> 52:41.291
I mean, this distinguishes you.

52:41.291 --> 52:43.458
What you build
puts you on the map.

52:43.458 --> 52:47.000
You just- you have
to put it out there.

52:47.000 --> 52:51.000
I think people have a certain
expectation of our work.

52:51.000 --> 52:53.250
Well, you're gonna have to be
willing to bend, Lance.

52:53.250 --> 52:54.667
I bend.

52:54.667 --> 52:55.834
I bend, ok?

52:55.834 --> 52:57.125
I bend more than anyone bends.

52:57.125 --> 52:58.917
That's debatable.

52:58.917 --> 53:00.166
Ok.

53:10.208 --> 53:11.875
All I'm saying is try
to incorporate

53:11.875 --> 53:13.834
what you do into your flips.

53:13.834 --> 53:16.291
Then there's no one who wouldn't
come to Lance Waddell.

53:16.291 --> 53:18.500
I don't know, it's risky.

53:18.500 --> 53:20.208
You took a risk once.

53:20.208 --> 53:23.000
Going to Portland,
going out on your own.

53:24.917 --> 53:25.625
That wasn't a risk, Jules.

53:25.625 --> 53:27.375
I was running.

53:27.375 --> 53:29.583
My mom had been gone a year,
my dad was selling the house

53:29.583 --> 53:31.959
and honestly I thought

53:31.959 --> 53:37.250
that we were gonna hit it
out of the park with that flip.

53:37.250 --> 53:38.875
But I let you down.

53:38.875 --> 53:40.500
I hated disappointing you.

53:40.500 --> 53:44.959
I know I didn't communicate that
very well but...

53:47.417 --> 53:49.959
I thought you blamed me.

53:49.959 --> 53:53.542
All you said is it's not working
out and you need a fresh start.

53:53.542 --> 53:58.583
I know. I'm sorry.

53:58.583 --> 54:04.125
It wasn't you I was
running from.

54:04.125 --> 54:06.500
I might be ok with a blue-ish
grey paint

54:06.500 --> 54:09.709
if it says all the things
we want it to.

54:09.709 --> 54:11.917
What do we want it
to say, again?

54:11.917 --> 54:13.583
Make me an offer?

54:13.583 --> 54:14.750
Right.

54:14.750 --> 54:15.875
Over the asking price.

54:15.875 --> 54:19.667
Mmmhmm.

54:19.667 --> 54:20.834
So blue-ish grey it is?

54:20.834 --> 54:23.333
Blue-ish grey it is.

54:23.333 --> 54:25.417
Ok, so I was thinking about
the front doors

54:25.417 --> 54:27.542
and I think they should
be the same.

54:27.542 --> 54:31.041
How do you feel about wooden
doors with stained glass?

54:31.041 --> 54:32.417
Well...

54:32.417 --> 54:33.250
Ok, we'll talk about it.

54:33.250 --> 54:34.667
Alright.

54:42.417 --> 54:47.625
Uh... Lance, why is half your
floor installed on my side?

54:47.625 --> 54:50.250
<i>They mixed up our orders!</i>

54:52.542 --> 54:54.375
Urgh!

54:58.458 --> 55:02.375
But Jack, we have the correct
numbers on the original invoice.

55:02.375 --> 55:04.709
I understand that, but you
signed this form upon delivery

55:04.709 --> 55:07.375
that you inspected the materials
and that everything was correct.

55:07.375 --> 55:09.542
Yes, but this is your mistake.

55:09.542 --> 55:13.458
And then it was yours when
you didn't verify the delivery.

55:13.458 --> 55:15.917
However, we can get an order
to you in two days

55:15.917 --> 55:17.166
if you let me know exactly

55:17.166 --> 55:19.500
how many square feet
you need to replace.

55:19.500 --> 55:22.041
With the 10 percent contractor's
discount again?

55:22.041 --> 55:24.291
Of course.

55:24.291 --> 55:25.959
Let me go write it up.

55:25.959 --> 55:27.083
This is for unit A?

55:27.083 --> 55:28.625
B!

55:31.083 --> 55:32.875
Yep, still terrified.

55:35.542 --> 55:37.166
This is my fault.

55:37.166 --> 55:39.333
I know to check boxes.

55:39.333 --> 55:40.917
And I'm paying to replace
your floors.

55:40.917 --> 55:42.041
I'm not gonna let you do that.

55:42.041 --> 55:44.125
Well, I pay for my mistakes, Lance.

55:44.125 --> 55:45.625
I could have just as easily
been the one

55:45.625 --> 55:47.875
to sign that form without
checking, believe me.

55:47.875 --> 55:49.291
It doesn't matter.

55:49.291 --> 55:51.083
The fact is it was me.

55:51.083 --> 55:53.125
And if I spend less time arguing
with you and more time

55:53.125 --> 55:55.250
on my attention to detail
we wouldn't be in this mess.

55:55.250 --> 55:58.750
It's just... you bring
that side out in me,

55:58.750 --> 56:00.875
you always have.

56:00.875 --> 56:03.125
Oh, di- di- di- n- n- n- n-

56:03.125 --> 56:06.208
I'm paying for your
replacement floors.

56:12.834 --> 56:14.083
There you go.

56:14.083 --> 56:15.709
Here you are.

56:17.333 --> 56:19.250
How's it going, ladies?

56:19.250 --> 56:21.000
Opening day is always
the busiest.

56:21.000 --> 56:23.417
Oh yeah, we've gotten
some great responses so far.

56:23.417 --> 56:25.083
This is so exciting.

56:25.083 --> 56:26.250
- Here we go, pop.
- Yep.

56:26.250 --> 56:27.583
- Got it.
- One, two...

56:27.583 --> 56:28.875
Jules, do you have
something prepared

56:28.875 --> 56:30.291
for the floral presentation
tonight?

56:30.291 --> 56:32.041
Uh, no, but I think I'll
just come up with something

56:32.041 --> 56:33.875
once I'm up there.

56:38.709 --> 56:40.458
What?

56:40.458 --> 56:46.500
It's a litmus test to see
who responds to my... art.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.709
Mmm.

56:52.250 --> 56:53.709
Hi, everyone.

56:53.709 --> 56:56.542
I'm Alice from Alice's Florals
and tonight my daughter, Jules,

56:56.542 --> 56:58.291
is gonna do a little demonstration

56:58.291 --> 57:00.625
on floral arranging
for spring.

57:06.458 --> 57:07.333
Thank you.

57:07.333 --> 57:08.667
Thanks, mom.

57:08.667 --> 57:10.417
So I practically grew up
in a flower shop

57:10.417 --> 57:12.792
so plants are second nature
to me.

57:12.792 --> 57:17.000
However, flower arranging
can sometimes be intimidating.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.667
Now, I'm gonna need a volunteer.

57:20.667 --> 57:22.250
- That's you.
- No.

57:22.959 --> 57:24.500
Oh, you, sir.

57:24.500 --> 57:27.458
Why don't you come up?

57:27.458 --> 57:29.125
Come on, Lance.
Get up there.

57:32.709 --> 57:33.875
Nothing to be afraid of,

57:33.875 --> 57:35.291
all you have to do
is just follow

57:35.291 --> 57:37.583
some simple instructions
that I give you.

57:37.583 --> 57:40.291
Follow instructions
from you... absolutely.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.083
I'm really gonna enjoy this.

57:42.083 --> 57:43.625
I bet you are.

57:43.625 --> 57:48.625
When designing an arrangement,
we follow specific steps.

57:48.625 --> 57:49.667
Proportion.

57:52.458 --> 57:57.291
We make sure our pairing
fits well together.

57:57.291 --> 58:01.375
Then balance and harmony.

58:01.375 --> 58:04.917
Harmony is always good.

58:04.917 --> 58:08.834
When things belong together
it's evident.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.500
Next is colour.

58:14.500 --> 58:17.542
As long as it's
not shockingly blue.

58:17.542 --> 58:21.834
Your colour should represent
exactly how you're feeling.

58:21.834 --> 58:23.625
They're doing the dance.

58:23.625 --> 58:25.917
Oh, please. They've been doing
the dance for weeks.

58:25.917 --> 58:29.166
Lastly, texture.

58:29.166 --> 58:31.834
Always make sure it feels right.

58:38.834 --> 58:43.417
The perfect bloom to top it off.

58:43.417 --> 58:45.417
Well done. You got it.

58:45.417 --> 58:46.917
No, wait, keep them.

58:46.917 --> 58:48.375
It's your handiwork.

58:48.375 --> 58:49.792
Thank you.

58:49.792 --> 58:52.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is Lance Waddell

58:52.250 --> 58:55.208
and Jules Briggs of
the Duplex Challenge.

58:55.208 --> 58:57.583
Check out their booths
and in six days

58:57.583 --> 59:02.500
they'll reveal their work and
you can vote for the best flip.

59:11.709 --> 59:14.875
Now that swing is
something else.

59:14.875 --> 59:16.375
Gerard.

59:16.375 --> 59:17.291
Evening, Ed.

59:17.291 --> 59:18.709
Hey.

59:18.709 --> 59:20.375
How come you never told me
you make pieces like this?

59:20.375 --> 59:21.959
Oh, because I don't.

59:21.959 --> 59:23.625
It's all him.

59:23.625 --> 59:26.583
Gerard Banks, Banks Furniture,
meet my son, Lance.

59:26.583 --> 59:29.583
Nice to meet you, I drive by
your store all the time.

59:29.583 --> 59:31.333
Next time come in.

59:31.333 --> 59:33.917
If you've got any more pieces
like this bring them in.

59:33.917 --> 59:36.417
I could sell a piece like that
in a heartbeat.

59:36.417 --> 59:41.417
We don't um... that was just
a sample that I did.

59:41.417 --> 59:48.500
Well, you got any extra samples,
send them my way.

59:48.500 --> 59:49.375
<i>Good to see you, Ed.</i>

59:49.375 --> 59:50.208
<i>Good to see you.</i>

59:50.208 --> 59:51.583
<i>Thanks, Gerard.</i>

1:00:29.458 --> 1:00:30.792
It's not here.

1:00:30.792 --> 1:00:33.750
I have permits for electrical,
plumbing, sewer line,

1:00:33.750 --> 1:00:35.709
but there's no record of
a permit being pulled

1:00:35.709 --> 1:00:36.875
for a kitchen expansion.

1:00:36.875 --> 1:00:37.750
I know how it looks.

1:00:37.750 --> 1:00:38.834
Yeah. So do I.

1:00:38.834 --> 1:00:40.625
But I don't cut corners.

1:00:40.625 --> 1:00:42.750
Everything's up to code and
the application was submitted.

1:00:42.750 --> 1:00:44.000
I have no record of
an application

1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:45.500
and you have no permit.

1:00:45.500 --> 1:00:47.542
That means everybody
here goes home.

1:00:47.542 --> 1:00:49.709
Work stops until I see a permit.

1:00:49.709 --> 1:00:51.500
Ethan, that's gonna take
like 48 hours.

1:00:51.500 --> 1:00:52.709
We don't have that kind of time.

1:00:52.709 --> 1:00:54.417
All work stops.

1:01:01.083 --> 1:01:03.375
Got a couple more invoices.

1:01:05.667 --> 1:01:06.834
What's wrong?

1:01:06.834 --> 1:01:08.959
It's gonna take 48 hours
to get us a new permit.

1:01:08.959 --> 1:01:11.750
Complete work stoppage
until it clears.

1:01:11.750 --> 1:01:12.542
You got tagged?

1:01:12.542 --> 1:01:14.125
Yes.

1:01:14.125 --> 1:01:16.959
You wanna tell me why my permit
application was never filed?

1:01:16.959 --> 1:01:17.792
It was.

1:01:17.792 --> 1:01:18.792
I dropped it off with Hal.

1:01:18.792 --> 1:01:19.625
Did you?

1:01:19.625 --> 1:01:20.625
Of course, he did.

1:01:20.625 --> 1:01:21.458
You did, right?

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:22.417
Yeah.

1:01:22.417 --> 1:01:23.750
Ok, look.

1:01:23.750 --> 1:01:25.083
I don't know what happened
but we'll get it fixed.

1:01:25.083 --> 1:01:26.625
We'll get you a retroactive
permit on the rush.

1:01:26.625 --> 1:01:29.375
Yes, Kenny is down there
trying to do that.

1:01:29.375 --> 1:01:30.959
So how did this happen?

1:01:30.959 --> 1:01:33.000
I don't know, Jules.
I am so sorry.

1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.750
I'm gonna find out right now, ok?

1:01:35.750 --> 1:01:38.375
Please tell me this isn't
what it looks like.

1:01:38.375 --> 1:01:39.542
It's not.

1:01:39.542 --> 1:01:41.542
There's nothing nefarious
going on here.

1:01:41.542 --> 1:01:43.250
I wouldn't do that to you
just to win,

1:01:43.250 --> 1:01:45.333
or to anyone for that matter.

1:01:45.333 --> 1:01:46.917
I would hope not.

1:01:46.917 --> 1:01:48.500
Look, it's only 48 hours, right?

1:01:48.500 --> 1:01:51.583
Yes, but it's four days
until voting.

1:01:51.583 --> 1:01:53.959
You can get it done.

1:01:53.959 --> 1:01:56.291
Only if my luck changes.

1:02:02.875 --> 1:02:06.291
Still nothing from Kenny?
It's been 48 hours.

1:02:06.291 --> 1:02:08.875
No.

1:02:08.875 --> 1:02:14.333
Well, at least the landscaping's
on schedule.

1:02:14.333 --> 1:02:17.792
At this point we'll have exactly
two days to finish painting.

1:02:17.792 --> 1:02:20.625
That's if the permit
comes through today.

1:02:20.625 --> 1:02:23.208
Well, lucky for you I'm a wiz
with the paint brush.

1:02:23.208 --> 1:02:25.083
Fastest brush in the west.

1:02:25.083 --> 1:02:26.500
Well, you're gonna have to be.

1:02:26.500 --> 1:02:28.041
And then some.

1:02:35.875 --> 1:02:37.291
Kenny just called!

1:02:37.291 --> 1:02:39.166
The inspector has the permit,
work hold has been lifted,

1:02:39.166 --> 1:02:40.583
we can start painting right now.

1:02:40.583 --> 1:02:42.458
Oh, finally.

1:02:42.458 --> 1:02:44.792
Congratulations, you did it.

1:02:50.750 --> 1:02:52.333
- Let's get on it.
- Yeah.

1:02:56.709 --> 1:02:58.750
You were saying?

1:03:17.959 --> 1:03:20.041
It's supposed to let up
by tomorrow

1:03:20.041 --> 1:03:24.458
which gives us two days, maybe.

1:03:24.458 --> 1:03:26.458
The biggest opportunity
to go out on my own,

1:03:26.458 --> 1:03:28.125
with free publicity to boot.

1:03:28.125 --> 1:03:31.625
The headline will say "Epic
fail, couldn't get it done".

1:03:31.625 --> 1:03:32.709
Come on.

1:03:32.709 --> 1:03:34.709
So things aren't going according
to plan.

1:03:34.709 --> 1:03:37.250
It's not like you to give up.

1:03:37.250 --> 1:03:41.041
We just gotta improvise.

1:03:41.041 --> 1:03:42.709
We?

1:03:42.709 --> 1:03:46.709
Yeah. We.

1:03:46.709 --> 1:03:48.667
This thing isn't done
'til 1:00 pm Friday

1:03:48.667 --> 1:03:50.917
so turn that frown
upside down.

1:03:50.917 --> 1:03:51.959
I don't frown.

1:03:51.959 --> 1:03:53.583
Ok, an aggressive pout, then.

1:03:55.083 --> 1:03:56.417
That's better.

1:03:56.417 --> 1:03:57.875
You're right.

1:03:57.875 --> 1:03:59.750
I'm already at rock bottom.
What else can go wrong?

1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.250
So much for my
electrical upgrade.

1:04:09.750 --> 1:04:10.792
That's good, right?

1:04:10.792 --> 1:04:11.875
Mmmhmm.

1:04:11.875 --> 1:04:15.083
I'm sure I haven't had
Lun Wah since...

1:04:15.083 --> 1:04:16.875
well, it's been a while.

1:04:16.875 --> 1:04:19.375
Yeah, I missed it a lot
when I was in Portland.

1:04:19.375 --> 1:04:21.291
No good Moo Shu there.

1:04:21.291 --> 1:04:22.792
No?

1:04:25.417 --> 1:04:27.041
Hey, I hope that the help
that you've given me

1:04:27.041 --> 1:04:29.291
hasn't set you back too much.

1:04:29.291 --> 1:04:30.667
Nah, we'll finish.

1:04:30.667 --> 1:04:32.750
I'll hire extra crew
if I have to.

1:04:32.750 --> 1:04:35.125
Yeah, well, crews cost money.

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:37.417
I know.

1:04:37.417 --> 1:04:39.542
I'll think of something, Jules.

1:04:39.542 --> 1:04:41.333
You don't have to do that.

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:43.583
This is my problem, too,
and like you said,

1:04:43.583 --> 1:04:46.625
we're in this together.

1:04:46.625 --> 1:04:50.500
It's kinda different
from the last time, isn't it?

1:04:50.500 --> 1:04:53.709
You and I coming up
with solutions together.

1:04:53.709 --> 1:04:56.000
Yeah, well maybe
that was our problem.

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:57.750
We were more against
each other back then

1:04:57.750 --> 1:05:00.250
when we were supposed
to be a team.

1:05:00.250 --> 1:05:01.750
Stubborn as a couple mules.

1:05:01.750 --> 1:05:03.208
Well, some of us
more than others.

1:05:03.208 --> 1:05:04.625
Yeah, that's fair.

1:05:04.625 --> 1:05:07.792
You were so very
much worse than me.

1:05:09.750 --> 1:05:12.542
What's so great about you,
Jules is you never gave up.

1:05:12.542 --> 1:05:15.583
Never backed down and you're not
gonna do that now.

1:05:15.583 --> 1:05:17.083
It keeps me going.

1:05:17.083 --> 1:05:21.250
I never knew you thought
that about me.

1:05:21.250 --> 1:05:27.333
I think you're exceptional,
and I should have told you.

1:05:32.834 --> 1:05:36.000
So what's changed?

1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.250
We're older.

1:05:38.250 --> 1:05:40.208
Wiser.

1:05:40.208 --> 1:05:43.250
Made our mistakes.

1:05:43.250 --> 1:05:45.834
I should have never have left.

1:05:45.834 --> 1:05:50.250
We lost too much on that flip,
you know?

1:05:50.250 --> 1:05:52.083
No, we didn't lose,
we broke even.

1:05:52.083 --> 1:05:54.125
No, it was a loss.

1:05:54.125 --> 1:05:56.208
I'm not gonna let
that happen again.

1:06:25.333 --> 1:06:30.667
Ok. You can answer that now.

1:06:30.667 --> 1:06:32.083
I appreciate the follow-through.

1:06:32.083 --> 1:06:33.750
Yeah, you know.

1:06:36.709 --> 1:06:39.625
Hey, Kenny.

1:06:39.625 --> 1:06:40.959
Really?

1:06:40.959 --> 1:06:43.458
Ok, can you- can you hold on
a second?

1:06:43.458 --> 1:06:45.125
It's ok.

1:06:45.125 --> 1:06:46.709
I gotta get back
to work anyways.

1:06:46.709 --> 1:06:48.375
Get your call.

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:00.375
Hey.

1:07:09.125 --> 1:07:10.083
Hey. Good morning.

1:07:10.083 --> 1:07:11.250
Good morning.

1:07:11.250 --> 1:07:12.792
Still on rain delay.

1:07:12.792 --> 1:07:14.875
Yeah, afraid so.

1:07:14.875 --> 1:07:18.250
And I'm out of candles.

1:07:18.250 --> 1:07:20.333
I guess I better head back
to the shop and uh,

1:07:20.333 --> 1:07:22.500
finish up those cabinets.

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:27.458
Yeah, I'm gonna head to the
Home and Garden show for a bit.

1:07:27.458 --> 1:07:29.125
Ok. Stay dry.

1:07:29.125 --> 1:07:30.834
You too.

1:07:36.750 --> 1:07:38.667
It sounds like this rain
is never gonna quit.

1:07:38.667 --> 1:07:43.417
Well, it's supposed to clear up
by tomorrow morning.

1:07:43.417 --> 1:07:46.917
That gives you one day
to paint an entire house.

1:07:46.917 --> 1:07:48.959
I'll have Jules' crew, too.

1:07:48.959 --> 1:07:51.000
Are they done with her interior?

1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:52.583
Working on it.

1:07:52.583 --> 1:07:55.792
You have got to hire a top-notch
crew of painters

1:07:55.792 --> 1:07:58.083
to get this done in time,
my friend.

1:07:58.083 --> 1:08:01.333
Costs money, pal.

1:08:01.333 --> 1:08:03.917
Ask your dad?

1:08:03.917 --> 1:08:08.792
This is my problem,
not his.

1:08:08.792 --> 1:08:11.291
I do not want to let her
down again.

1:08:17.750 --> 1:08:21.000
...I'm hoping it comes in
this afternoon.

1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:22.166
I hope so.

1:08:22.166 --> 1:08:24.333
Oh, thank you, Kat.

1:08:24.333 --> 1:08:27.083
Unfortunately, I'm gonna need
a lot more than caffeine.

1:08:27.083 --> 1:08:28.750
There's no way we're gonna
finish painting this house

1:08:28.750 --> 1:08:31.166
in one day with
my skeleton crew.

1:08:31.166 --> 1:08:32.375
Well, I'll help you.

1:08:32.375 --> 1:08:34.333
And I'm sure Richard
will come, too.

1:08:34.333 --> 1:08:35.583
And we can get your mom.

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:36.834
Really? You would do that?

1:08:36.834 --> 1:08:39.000
Yeah. Well, it's a house,

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.041
it's not like you need
to be Picasso.

1:08:41.041 --> 1:08:42.333
And I'll help you.

1:08:42.333 --> 1:08:43.542
Anyone would.

1:08:43.542 --> 1:08:45.458
Trust me.
Watch this.

1:08:45.458 --> 1:08:46.959
Hey, everyone!

1:08:46.959 --> 1:08:48.625
Who can paint and would be
willing to clear their schedule

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:53.291
to help Jules and Lance
finish the duplex challenge?

1:08:53.291 --> 1:08:55.709
Exterior only,
no peeking inside.

1:08:59.291 --> 1:09:00.250
That's like eight people.

1:09:00.250 --> 1:09:01.250
We can do this.

1:09:01.250 --> 1:09:02.208
Ok. Ok, yeah.

1:09:02.208 --> 1:09:03.625
This might work.

1:09:03.625 --> 1:09:06.375
I'm gonna go run this by
Lance and- and I will be back.

1:09:06.375 --> 1:09:07.625
Thank you, everyone!

1:09:07.625 --> 1:09:08.750
Yeah.

1:09:08.750 --> 1:09:10.166
Oh, your coffee.

1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:14.834
Make sure you edge
around that window.

1:09:14.834 --> 1:09:16.375
Double up, even.

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:18.333
Get behind that drain pipe, too.

1:09:18.333 --> 1:09:19.542
It's gotta be perfect, man.

1:09:19.542 --> 1:09:21.291
No, no, no. What- Lance,
what're you doing?

1:09:21.291 --> 1:09:22.583
We can't afford this.

1:09:22.583 --> 1:09:23.417
It's ok.

1:09:23.417 --> 1:09:24.667
Don't worry about the money.

1:09:24.667 --> 1:09:25.542
I'm covering it.

1:09:25.542 --> 1:09:26.709
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1:09:26.709 --> 1:09:28.208
This is my responsibility, too.

1:09:28.208 --> 1:09:31.208
It's alright, I figured it out
for us.

1:09:31.208 --> 1:09:33.709
Without talking to me?

1:09:33.709 --> 1:09:35.667
I thought we were past this.

1:09:35.667 --> 1:09:39.208
Acting on your impulses,
making expensive decisions

1:09:39.208 --> 1:09:40.333
that can't be undone.

1:09:40.333 --> 1:09:41.417
I didn't think that uh-

1:09:41.417 --> 1:09:44.291
Yeah, exactly, you didn't think.

1:09:44.291 --> 1:09:48.083
Look, I had a viable solution
and I was coming to talk to you

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:51.917
about it because that's what you
do when you're in it together.

1:09:51.917 --> 1:09:53.875
You come to an agreement.

1:09:53.875 --> 1:09:56.417
One that doesn't spend the money
I don't have.

1:09:56.417 --> 1:09:59.417
No, Jules, you don't have
to pay me back.

1:09:59.417 --> 1:10:02.000
Of course, I do.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:05.917
Ok, look. It's getting painted
now, right?

1:10:05.917 --> 1:10:08.500
Honestly, I thought
that you would be happy.

1:10:08.500 --> 1:10:11.458
And I thought we were
becoming a team.

1:10:11.458 --> 1:10:14.125
But we're not.

1:10:14.125 --> 1:10:16.333
And that was always our problem.

1:10:19.959 --> 1:10:21.792
Jules...

1:10:31.625 --> 1:10:34.041
I would have given you
the money, you know?

1:10:34.041 --> 1:10:36.875
Nah, I wouldn't ask you for it.

1:10:36.875 --> 1:10:38.458
I took on this challenge
on my own,

1:10:38.458 --> 1:10:40.500
I needed to see it through
on my own,

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:43.500
with no handouts.

1:10:43.500 --> 1:10:48.583
Did you make some good money
selling your mom's stuff?

1:10:48.583 --> 1:10:51.083
Yeah, great money, actually.

1:10:51.083 --> 1:10:56.125
So what do you think about
adding some personal touches

1:10:56.125 --> 1:10:57.542
to these flips?

1:10:57.542 --> 1:11:02.166
I know people are used to
a certain classic uniform

1:11:02.166 --> 1:11:04.625
aesthetic but uh...

1:11:04.625 --> 1:11:07.083
Yeah, but I only do that because
I don't have your talent.

1:11:07.083 --> 1:11:10.125
I mean, I can design
and execute a renovation

1:11:10.125 --> 1:11:11.917
but I can't do what you do,

1:11:11.917 --> 1:11:14.625
and I can't think of a better
debut than a property

1:11:14.625 --> 1:11:18.667
with a little
Lance Waddell flair.

1:11:18.667 --> 1:11:21.166
I think it'll help sell
the place.

1:11:21.166 --> 1:11:23.083
Yeah, we'll see.

1:11:23.083 --> 1:11:26.125
We'll see.

1:11:26.125 --> 1:11:29.208
I think I messed up again, pop.

1:11:29.208 --> 1:11:30.667
With the duplex?

1:11:30.667 --> 1:11:33.417
No, Jules.

1:11:33.417 --> 1:11:35.375
I can't seem to do the right
thing, you know?

1:11:35.375 --> 1:11:37.291
I'm sure you can.

1:11:37.291 --> 1:11:39.208
How so?

1:11:39.208 --> 1:11:40.750
Apologize.

1:11:40.750 --> 1:11:42.083
Listen.

1:11:42.083 --> 1:11:45.125
Just really hear her.

1:11:45.125 --> 1:11:46.542
Great, now you tell me.

1:11:48.834 --> 1:11:51.750
Ah, it's never too late son.

1:11:51.750 --> 1:11:53.291
Never too late.

1:12:25.625 --> 1:12:27.583
You did it again, Kenny.

1:12:27.583 --> 1:12:28.917
This is all your vision, Jules.

1:12:28.917 --> 1:12:31.083
I'm just the one executing it.

1:12:31.083 --> 1:12:32.375
And I think we have a winner.

1:12:32.375 --> 1:12:34.041
I hope so.

1:12:39.291 --> 1:12:42.083
He seems way behind.

1:12:42.083 --> 1:12:43.667
Hopefully he can get it done.

1:12:43.667 --> 1:12:44.709
The magazine people are here.

1:12:44.709 --> 1:12:46.000
It's that time!

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.542
We're ready to get our footage.

1:12:47.542 --> 1:12:50.000
But please, be careful, the
exterior paint may still be wet.

1:12:50.000 --> 1:12:51.375
Oh, that's not a problem.

1:12:51.375 --> 1:12:53.750
It'll photograph well
and that's all that matters.

1:12:53.750 --> 1:12:55.291
Hi, hi.

1:12:55.291 --> 1:12:59.458
Hi, Elsie, can I possibly maybe
please have a couple more hours?

1:12:59.458 --> 1:13:02.917
Almost there. 3:00 latest.

1:13:02.917 --> 1:13:06.458
Can you be done by then,
because it's really pushing it.

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:10.375
Yeah, I can be done.

1:13:10.375 --> 1:13:13.333
Ok, we'll be back at 3:00
to film both of you.

1:13:13.333 --> 1:13:14.875
Ok.

1:13:14.875 --> 1:13:16.333
But I have to say, Lance, in
the interest of this competition

1:13:16.333 --> 1:13:19.208
where you're at at the time
is how we photograph you.

1:13:19.208 --> 1:13:20.667
No more extensions.

1:13:20.667 --> 1:13:22.083
Yeah. No more extensions.

1:13:22.083 --> 1:13:23.417
Thank you.

1:13:23.417 --> 1:13:26.625
Mark, bring in the rest
of these cabinet doors!

1:13:26.625 --> 1:13:27.792
Ok, see you at 3:00.

1:13:27.792 --> 1:13:28.667
See you at 3:00.

1:13:28.667 --> 1:13:30.583
- Yes.
- Thanks.

1:13:32.667 --> 1:13:34.041
<i>What's the matter, honey?</i>

1:13:34.041 --> 1:13:35.417
Lance is very behind.

1:13:35.417 --> 1:13:37.709
They extended us to 3:00 pm.

1:13:37.709 --> 1:13:39.000
I feel kinda bad for him.

1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:40.166
He worked so hard.

1:13:40.166 --> 1:13:42.250
Well, so why are you so mad
at him?

1:13:42.250 --> 1:13:46.125
Well, I'm not mad at him,
it's just...

1:13:46.125 --> 1:13:47.917
it felt like before
all over again.

1:13:47.917 --> 1:13:50.875
You know, he gets this big idea,
he just jumps into it

1:13:50.875 --> 1:13:52.583
without even talking
to me about it.

1:13:52.583 --> 1:13:54.917
It felt like we were finally
becoming a team.

1:13:54.917 --> 1:13:57.625
That's what a teammate
or partner does,

1:13:57.625 --> 1:14:01.667
they- they come through
for each other in a pinch.

1:14:01.667 --> 1:14:03.041
When you love someone
all you wanna do

1:14:03.041 --> 1:14:04.625
is make things better
for them.

1:14:04.625 --> 1:14:06.208
You two didn't do that
for each other before.

1:14:06.208 --> 1:14:11.000
Maybe this is just him learning
from his mistakes.

1:14:12.875 --> 1:14:14.709
Hey, Jules.

1:14:14.709 --> 1:14:15.959
Good luck today.

1:14:15.959 --> 1:14:17.083
Thanks, Ed.

1:14:17.083 --> 1:14:20.500
Look, I know my son can
be... tricky.

1:14:20.500 --> 1:14:23.333
But he really did
just wanna help out.

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:26.083
He wouldn't have sold
the furniture otherwise.

1:14:26.083 --> 1:14:27.375
What furniture?

1:14:27.375 --> 1:14:30.208
Those pieces he made
for his mother years ago.

1:14:30.208 --> 1:14:32.083
They meant a lot to him.

1:14:35.125 --> 1:14:37.333
Oh... thank you, Ed.

1:14:37.333 --> 1:14:38.875
I have to go.

1:14:43.500 --> 1:14:45.834
Alright, you have 15 minutes
before Elsie gets here.

1:14:45.834 --> 1:14:47.041
Where do you want this?

1:14:47.041 --> 1:14:48.667
I was thinking right
beside the French doors.

1:14:48.667 --> 1:14:50.208
That's what I was thinking.

1:14:50.208 --> 1:14:51.333
I like this, by the way.

1:14:51.333 --> 1:14:52.792
Oh yeah, it's beautiful.

1:14:52.792 --> 1:14:54.000
Alright, let's move it!
We have a job to finish!

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:55.250
Come on in.

1:14:55.250 --> 1:14:57.458
Let's hop to it! Come on!

As I'll ever be.

1:15:44.291 --> 1:15:45.542
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:15:45.542 --> 1:15:47.917
on behalf of Innovative
Designs magazine

1:15:47.917 --> 1:15:50.500
we want to thank you for helping
make this year's

1:15:50.500 --> 1:15:53.834
Home and Garden show
such a huge success.

1:15:53.834 --> 1:15:57.291
And for those of you watching
online thanks for tuning in.

1:16:00.458 --> 1:16:02.875
Thank you.

1:16:02.875 --> 1:16:05.125
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

1:16:05.125 --> 1:16:09.333
The reveal of our
flip challenge.

1:16:09.333 --> 1:16:12.625
This is what the duplex looked
like just six short weeks ago.

1:16:14.583 --> 1:16:17.291
Fast forward to today
and you will not believe

1:16:17.291 --> 1:16:20.709
the incredible results.

1:16:25.166 --> 1:16:26.834
Jules or Lance?

1:16:26.834 --> 1:16:29.417
Let's go take a look.

1:16:33.125 --> 1:16:34.625
Are you all ready?

1:16:36.417 --> 1:16:38.917
Hi there. Come on in.

1:16:38.917 --> 1:16:41.959
Come on.

1:16:41.959 --> 1:16:46.583
Wow. Isn't this
absolutely stunning?

1:16:46.583 --> 1:16:50.667
And look at this kitchen.

1:16:50.667 --> 1:16:53.834
Wow.

1:16:59.417 --> 1:17:02.166
When I discovered this
amazing mural

1:17:02.166 --> 1:17:03.542
I knew it was just what I needed

1:17:03.542 --> 1:17:04.959
to set the tone
for the entire home.

1:17:04.959 --> 1:17:07.375
I think I achieved
what I set out to do.

1:17:07.375 --> 1:17:10.125
Create a fresh take on
a farmhouse aesthetic.

1:17:10.125 --> 1:17:13.333
Warm, welcoming and comfortable.

1:17:13.333 --> 1:17:16.417
Well, I could certainly
see myself living here.

1:17:20.125 --> 1:17:23.667
This is going to be
a tough act to follow.

1:17:23.667 --> 1:17:25.333
And there's more!

1:17:27.125 --> 1:17:30.875
<i>Jules' side of the duplex
is filled with her
signature style.</i>

1:17:30.875 --> 1:17:35.250
<i>Bright clean designs that still
feel cozy and comfortable.</i>

1:17:35.250 --> 1:17:40.709
<i>A beautiful renovation
from top to bottom.</i>

1:17:43.333 --> 1:17:45.542
I'll admit it is spectacular

1:17:45.542 --> 1:17:47.750
but don't make up your
minds just yet.

1:17:47.750 --> 1:17:49.875
Let's see what Lance
has in store for us.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:51.083
Come on.

1:17:51.083 --> 1:17:52.792
<i>Yeah Lance!</i>

1:17:59.208 --> 1:18:02.166
Hello, and welcome
to your beautiful home.

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:04.917
Come on in.

1:18:04.917 --> 1:18:06.417
Oh, wow.

1:18:06.417 --> 1:18:08.875
Isn't this exciting?

1:18:08.875 --> 1:18:10.750
Here we go.

1:18:20.792 --> 1:18:23.500
Clean lines, earthy tones
and natural textures

1:18:23.500 --> 1:18:26.709
create a sense of order, calm.

1:18:26.709 --> 1:18:30.750
These coppered cabinets have
been patina-ed for a retro feel.

1:18:30.750 --> 1:18:33.917
I've made a space that
has an organic flow

1:18:33.917 --> 1:18:37.291
with architectural interest.

1:18:37.291 --> 1:18:41.166
I'm feeling more
centred already.

1:18:41.166 --> 1:18:42.625
Woooo!!!

1:18:46.917 --> 1:18:49.709
All I can say is I'm glad
you're the ones deciding

1:18:49.709 --> 1:18:50.875
and not me.

1:18:50.875 --> 1:18:52.333
Whew!

1:18:52.333 --> 1:18:56.041
Now let's see what he did
with the rest of the house.

1:18:57.291 --> 1:18:58.792
<i>Lance's side of the duplex</i>

1:18:58.792 --> 1:19:02.667
<i>incorporates elements of
his artistic design.</i>

1:19:02.667 --> 1:19:06.959
<i>Upcycling older pieces to creae
something bold, beautiful</i>

1:19:06.959 --> 1:19:10.917
<i>and impossible to find
anywhere else.</i>

1:19:10.917 --> 1:19:12.375
There it is, folks.

1:19:12.375 --> 1:19:16.166
One duplex, two astonishing
but very different flips.

1:19:16.166 --> 1:19:18.083
Now it's all up to you.

1:19:26.542 --> 1:19:27.667
You got this!

1:19:27.667 --> 1:19:30.291
Yeah, Lance!

1:19:30.291 --> 1:19:33.417
Please visit our voting booths
located in any of the pavilions

1:19:33.417 --> 1:19:35.583
and be sure to choose
your favourite.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:38.875
And for those of you online,
voting is now open.

1:19:38.875 --> 1:19:42.250
We'll be back at 7:00 to reveal
the winner of the grand prize.

1:19:42.250 --> 1:19:45.959
The Flip of the Month spread
in Innovative Designs magazine!

1:19:53.834 --> 1:19:54.667
How'd it go?

1:19:54.667 --> 1:19:55.417
Good, and you?

1:19:55.417 --> 1:19:56.333
Good.

1:19:56.333 --> 1:19:58.000
Who'd you vote for?

1:19:58.000 --> 1:19:59.625
It's supposed to be a secret,
isn't it?

1:19:59.625 --> 1:20:00.542
I don't think so.

1:20:00.542 --> 1:20:01.917
Good. Because I voted for you.

1:20:01.917 --> 1:20:02.792
No, you did not.

1:20:02.792 --> 1:20:03.709
I did.

1:20:03.709 --> 1:20:05.959
Good, 'cause I voted for you.

1:20:05.959 --> 1:20:07.208
Stop it.

1:20:07.208 --> 1:20:08.417
It's true.

1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:15.792
Everybody, please
take your seats.

1:20:15.792 --> 1:20:18.583
We're ready to announce
the results.

1:20:27.875 --> 1:20:33.542
With a total of 16,408 votes
between the show

1:20:33.542 --> 1:20:38.583
and online voting I'm happy
to announce that the winner,

1:20:38.583 --> 1:20:41.291
by a margin of only nine votes is...

1:20:46.542 --> 1:20:48.583
Jules Briggs!

1:20:56.291 --> 1:20:58.875
Go Jules, yes!

1:21:15.458 --> 1:21:17.959
Yes, absolutely.

1:21:17.959 --> 1:21:20.166
Congratulations.

1:21:20.166 --> 1:21:22.375
I don't deserve it any more
than you do.

1:21:22.375 --> 1:21:23.458
Well...

1:21:23.458 --> 1:21:28.375
And I'm sorry
for getting so upset.

1:21:28.375 --> 1:21:31.166
I know your intentions
were good.

1:21:31.166 --> 1:21:35.000
But we tell each other
everything from now on.

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:35.834
From now on?

1:21:35.834 --> 1:21:38.583
Mmmhmm.

1:21:38.583 --> 1:21:43.250
Well, in that case uh, there's
something I gotta tell you.

1:21:43.250 --> 1:21:47.250
I could have gone above $150,000
on your side of the duplex.

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:49.667
Why didn't you?

1:21:49.667 --> 1:21:51.375
You seemed like you
really wanted it.

1:21:51.375 --> 1:21:52.291
Yeah.

1:21:52.291 --> 1:21:55.041
Maybe I wanted you nearby.

1:21:55.041 --> 1:21:56.500
Well, it did kinda
save the day.

1:21:56.500 --> 1:21:59.792
Yeah, you really did.

1:21:59.792 --> 1:22:04.125
You sold your mom's furniture.

1:22:04.125 --> 1:22:07.166
Yeah, it was time,
you know.

1:22:07.166 --> 1:22:08.500
I think I'm gonna be
pretty busy,

1:22:08.500 --> 1:22:11.333
I could use the space.

1:22:11.333 --> 1:22:14.208
You know, I've been handing
out a lot of business cards.

1:22:14.208 --> 1:22:18.250
It seems like people might,
maybe like my stuff.

1:22:18.250 --> 1:22:19.709
Yeah.

1:22:19.709 --> 1:22:21.375
So do I.

1:22:21.375 --> 1:22:26.375
Thank you for pushing me to
put more of myself in the flip.

1:22:26.375 --> 1:22:30.458
And believing in me.
It means a lot, Jules.

1:22:30.458 --> 1:22:35.959
Well, I like to think that I was
believing in us.

1:22:35.959 --> 1:22:38.166
Sounds like you're in the market
for a partner.

1:22:38.166 --> 1:22:39.917
Oh, do you-
do you know one?

1:22:39.917 --> 1:22:42.041
I might.

1:22:42.041 --> 1:22:43.375
You do have to be
willing to bend, though.

1:22:43.375 --> 1:22:44.375
Oh.

1:22:44.375 --> 1:22:45.291
Yeah, I know.

1:22:45.291 --> 1:22:47.250
Oh. Well, I bend.

1:22:47.250 --> 1:22:48.709
- Oh, you bend?
- Mmmhmm.

1:22:48.709 --> 1:22:50.583
- I know.
- Mmmhmm.

1:23:03.709 --> 1:23:06.083
You know, it's not bad
for six weeks' work.

1:23:06.083 --> 1:23:07.959
Not bad at all.

1:23:07.959 --> 1:23:10.667
Good. 'Cause Richard's got us
a property to look at

1:23:10.667 --> 1:23:12.709
first thing in the morning.

1:23:12.709 --> 1:23:13.959
Can't wait.

1:23:13.959 --> 1:23:16.333
Me too.

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:31.667
- I still think my side's better.
- I bet you do.
