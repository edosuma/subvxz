AKU: Long ago
in a distant land,

00:04.714 --> 00:09.427
I, Aku, the shape-shifting
master of darkness,

00:09.511 --> 00:12.931
unleashed an unspeakable evil,

00:13.348 --> 00:16.226
but a foolish Samurai warrior

00:16.309 --> 00:18.603
wielding a magic sword

00:18.853 --> 00:21.606
stepped forth to oppose me.

00:24.442 --> 00:26.653

was struck,

00:26.736 --> 00:29.447
I tore open a portal in time

00:29.531 --> 00:31.491
and flung him into the future,

00:31.574 --> 00:33.910
where my evil is law.

00:34.369 --> 00:38.373
Now the fool seeks
to return to the past,

00:38.456 --> 00:43.127
and undo the future that is Aku.

Greetings, Imakandi.

05:18.486 --> 05:22.323
I am Aku, master
of the planet Earth.

05:23.074 --> 05:24.867
I have traveled far

05:24.951 --> 05:27.662
to offer you
the greatest hunt.

05:28.329 --> 05:31.707
A great prey runs
free on my planet,

05:32.208 --> 05:35.962
terrorizing all
that I have worked for.

05:36.420 --> 05:41.133
Many have attempted
to capture this elusive target.

05:45.346 --> 05:49.267
I present this challenge
to you, Imakandi,

05:49.350 --> 05:53.437
for you are the greatest hunters
of the universe.

05:54.313 --> 05:58.818
I bring you countless
treasure if you accept.

05:59.819 --> 06:01.779
And if you succeed,

06:01.863 --> 06:03.865
the skies will darken,

06:04.657 --> 06:09.412
and a rain of priceless jewels
will flood your world,

06:10.079 --> 06:16.502
making you rich
beyond your wildest dreams.

06:20.381 --> 06:23.759
Our race has existed
for countless eons.

06:24.302 --> 06:26.345
The hunt is
our way of life.

06:27.013 --> 06:28.514
It runs through our veins.

06:29.181 --> 06:30.391
It makes us rich.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.894
Rich beyond material wealth.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.271
We accept your challenge,

06:35.730 --> 06:37.940
but we need
not your treasure.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.735
All we want is
the thrill of the hunt,

06:41.402 --> 06:44.113
for we are Imakandi.

06:45.031 --> 06:47.325

06:47.700 --> 06:51.913

captured the one being

20:16.007 --> 20:19.428
who ran free
on this world of mine.

please hand him to me.
