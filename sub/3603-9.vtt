isn't it, Dad?

01:23.167 --> 01:24.748

abduct people.

and your friends locked
him up 30 years ago. Why?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.624
He was dangerous.
Dangerous how?
Like a bomb?

34:09.715 --> 34:13.082
No. Worse.
We thought he was
just able to heal.

34:13.219 --> 34:14.709
Cellular regeneration.

34:14.803 --> 34:16.009
Like Claire,
your granddaughter.

34:16.096 --> 34:20.339
What we didn't know
was that if your cells
continually regenerate,

34:21.310 --> 34:23.221
after a while,
you stop growing old.

34:23.312 --> 34:24.518
What's old?

34:25.481 --> 34:27.142
Four hundred years.

34:30.152 --> 34:31.232
Do you know
where Adam is now?

34:31.320 --> 34:32.605
All I know
is that he wants
revenge

34:32.696 --> 34:35.563
for locking him up,
and he's not going to rest
until all of us are dead.

34:35.658 --> 34:38.741
All of you are. Except
for you, Bob, my dad, and
this woman in the photo.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.203
Who is this
woman?

34:40.287 --> 34:42.664
(WHISPERING)
Please. Don't do this.

34:42.831 --> 34:44.241
I need you to
tell me the truth.

34:44.333 --> 34:46.039
The truth...

34:46.126 --> 34:50.790
The truth is that
our generation mortgaged
our souls to protect yours.

34:50.881 --> 34:53.463
Show a little
respect for that.

34:53.592 --> 34:56.504
Get over your
daddyissues
and leave us be.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.265
That's all I want.
Believe me.

35:01.183 --> 35:04.846
But Adam is still out there,
and this woman is on his list.

35:08.148 --> 35:11.140
Tell me the truth.
Who is she?

35:15.864 --> 35:18.321
All she wants
is to be left alone.

35:19.535 --> 35:21.366
I made her a promise.

35:23.414 --> 35:27.623
If you take this secret
from me, you're notjust
like your father,

35:34.049 --> 35:35.505
you are him.

35:45.811 --> 35:47.676
What kind of car
do you drive?

35:47.771 --> 35:48.760
Excuse me?

35:48.856 --> 35:50.141
I know you can fly,
but you're still
a teenager.

35:50.232 --> 35:51.563
You do have
a car. Right?

35:51.650 --> 35:53.982
WEST: Yeah. It's
a piece of crap SUV.

35:54.069 --> 35:56.446
I drove a 52 Citroen
when I was your age.

35:56.530 --> 35:58.316
Those things
are awesome.

36:13.964 --> 36:17.081
Once we get Claire,
you fly her out
immediately,

36:17.217 --> 36:20.880
no matter what else happens.
Do you understand me?

36:20.971 --> 36:22.256
Yes, sir.

36:27.770 --> 36:30.352
It doesn't have
to be this way,
Noah.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.508
Dad! The painting!

37:03.430 --> 37:04.806
(GRUNTING)

37:09.395 --> 37:10.384
(SCREAMS)

37:10.479 --> 37:11.719
Claire!

37:13.524 --> 37:15.139
(CLAIRE GRUNTS)

37:17.111 --> 37:18.100
(GRUNTS)

37:18.195 --> 37:19.310
Elle!

37:22.157 --> 37:25.866
No matter what I do,
we'll always be running.

37:27.579 --> 37:30.412
But if you die, Bob,

37:30.541 --> 37:32.623
the Company dies with you.

37:33.544 --> 37:35.956
MOHINDER: Please,
don't do this.

37:39.258 --> 37:40.498
(GRUNTS)

37:41.677 --> 37:43.258
(GUN COCKING)

37:43.345 --> 37:44.960
(GUNSHOT FIRES)

37:46.098 --> 37:47.178
Dad!

38:39.193 --> 38:41.855
The last thing
I really said
to my dad

38:43.572 --> 38:45.233
was, "I hate you."

38:46.742 --> 38:48.482
You didn't mean it.

38:50.412 --> 38:51.777
No, I did.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.873
I keep playing it
over and over.

39:00.088 --> 39:03.046
Now I'll never get
a chance to take it back.

39:34.957 --> 39:36.743
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)

40:24.756 --> 40:27.213
(HIRO CONTINUES SPEAKING)

41:56.264 --> 41:57.595
(GASPING)

42:04.981 --> 42:06.107
Holy...
