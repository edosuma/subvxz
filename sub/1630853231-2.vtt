WEBVTT

00:40.666 --> 00:41.792
Okay.

00:46.755 --> 00:49.758
So, this one is gonna go
to uni with you, right?

00:53.011 --> 00:54.012
Yeah. Sure.

00:55.889 --> 00:58.433
And what about the "big heads"?
What do you wanna do with them?

00:58.517 --> 01:00.769
They're not called big heads, Mum.
They're called Pop Vinyls.

01:00.853 --> 01:03.146
All right.
Well, I still call them big heads.

01:04.230 --> 01:05.524
I mean, whatever.

01:06.066 --> 01:07.943
I was planning on leaving them
right there on the shelf,

01:08.026 --> 01:12.197
but I guess I can't do that anymore.
You can give 'em away.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.033
No, no. We're gonna find a spot for them.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.036
It's just annoying.

01:18.120 --> 01:20.747
You know, having to spend the next
two months sharing a room with Henry.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.583
Todd, I'm sorry, okay?

01:23.166 --> 01:24.960
Whatever. I can stay at Amy's.

01:25.043 --> 01:27.212
You're not gonna stay at Amy's.

01:27.296 --> 01:30.424
And why not?
You and Dad had sex in high school.

01:31.008 --> 01:33.510
Yeah, we snuck around
like normal teenagers, all right?

01:33.594 --> 01:34.678
No one agreed to host us.

01:34.761 --> 01:38.348
Yeah, well, her parents are cool.
They don't care if I sleep over.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.184
Well, your parents aren't cool.

01:40.267 --> 01:42.686
I need a few more years before
I'm gonna come down and have breakfast

01:42.769 --> 01:45.731
with you and your girlfriend, all right?
I'm not ready for that.

01:45.814 --> 01:46.982
Whatever.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.444
It's not like I'm gonna live here
anymore anyway.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.237
Once you give my room to Nan.

01:54.281 --> 01:56.325
Your room is downstairs.
It's easier for her.

01:57.326 --> 02:01.872
Yeah, with a new alarm system that beeps
every time the door opens.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.165
To protect her.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.459
So she doesn't wander off
in the middle of the night.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.002
This place totally feels like a jail.

02:09.922 --> 02:12.049
Well, would you not say that
in front of her, please?

02:15.677 --> 02:20.641
Hey. How about I give you a haircut?
I won't charge you.

02:24.561 --> 02:27.022
No. I like it long.

02:32.736 --> 02:34.821
-Hey, babe.
-Hey.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.574
Hot date?

02:38.784 --> 02:41.537
Have to be on the road
at 5:00 a.m., and I feel like shit.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.290
So, I'm gonna look fantastic.

02:47.668 --> 02:50.879
Heard you got nice mother-and-son
time helping him pack up his room?

02:50.963 --> 02:52.714
Well, it was more me boxing things up

02:52.798 --> 02:56.176
and him telling me that he wanted
to move in with Amy and her parents

02:56.260 --> 02:57.761
so he could have lots of sex.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.180
Well, I mean, you know…

03:00.264 --> 03:04.309
God. I wish they'd broken up after
their last fight. She's not friendly.

03:04.393 --> 03:06.186
She has those horrible short bangs.

03:08.438 --> 03:11.316
-Think you were friendly when you were 17?
-Fuck yeah.

03:11.400 --> 03:12.943
-Really?
-I was very friendly.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.820
I think this is a bit
of revisionist history.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.072
-Ask my mum.
-Think about--

03:17.155 --> 03:18.949
I think you should ask my mum actually.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.869
Actually, don't ask my mum
'cause it'll trigger her.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.006
So, how long
you reckon she's gonna be here?

03:34.923 --> 03:36.341
Come on. We talked about this.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.802
Yeah, we didn't talk about numbers,
so what are we talking?

03:38.886 --> 03:41.889
We talking six months or six years?

03:41.972 --> 03:43.599
Would you just be supportive, please?

03:43.682 --> 03:47.227
I am supportive, but she's not the easiest
person in the world to get along with.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.353
You'd say that yourself.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.814
She has nowhere else to go.
She's my mother.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.733
Yeah, it's fine. It's okay.

03:52.816 --> 03:54.776
She's family. She's coming.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.196
I was just asking about a timeline.
That's all.

03:57.279 --> 04:00.616
I can't get through the next few days.
I'm gonna have a really tough time.

04:01.450 --> 04:04.161
So please, don't make me think ahead.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.170
I love that one.
It's one of me absolute faves.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.254
Let's…

04:29.228 --> 04:32.397
Kinda love you
…feet…

04:32.481 --> 04:33.524
…Let it all hang out

04:33.607 --> 04:37.611
Oh, the temper of the time

04:39.780 --> 04:44.368
Oh, the power and the passion…

04:45.577 --> 04:49.748
Sometimes you've got to take
the hardest line

04:54.378 --> 04:57.756
And the world seems to disappear

05:00.259 --> 05:05.597
Disappear, disappear, disappear

05:07.891 --> 05:09.434
Disappear

05:43.594 --> 05:44.595
Yep?

05:45.554 --> 05:46.972
Hi, Mum. It's me.

05:53.395 --> 05:54.396
It's your daughter.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.358
The doctor told me not to spring
things on you

05:58.442 --> 06:00.485
'cause it can make you agitated
and disoriented,

06:00.569 --> 06:04.156
so I'm out here in the driveway.
Take your time.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.622
You think I'm so far gone
I can't answer my own door?

06:14.124 --> 06:15.792
Just doing what the doctor said.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.213
-You hungry?
-No.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.966
-Good, 'cause I didn't cook anything.
-Okay.

06:35.521 --> 06:36.605
Good morning.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.774
What's all this?

06:40.025 --> 06:41.527
I've put everything out so you can see it.

06:41.610 --> 06:43.820
So you can think about
what you wanna bring.

06:45.781 --> 06:46.949
I don't want anything.

06:49.576 --> 06:53.372
I rented that awful van.
There's plenty of room, so…

06:54.081 --> 06:56.500
I don't have enough time to go through
all that stuff.

06:57.209 --> 06:59.461
The doctor said you'd be much happier

06:59.545 --> 07:02.840
if you were surrounded by some
of your own things.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.676
Yes. He also said it would be years
before I got worse.

07:06.510 --> 07:07.719
He was way off, wasn't he?

07:10.013 --> 07:13.141
He just said that you would be a lot more
comfortable, less agitated…

07:13.225 --> 07:14.226
I'm not agitated.

07:14.309 --> 07:17.437
…if you were surrounded by
all of the things that you love,

07:17.521 --> 07:19.106
like your books and--

07:19.189 --> 07:21.358
Yes, 'cause I presume
you don't have any of those.

07:22.359 --> 07:23.360
It's your space to--

07:23.443 --> 07:26.154
Where are all my cups? God's sake.

07:27.823 --> 07:32.160
Please. I am being dragged from my home.
I'm not packing up to go away on holiday.

07:33.036 --> 07:35.163
We have all the time we need
to do this right.

07:35.247 --> 07:38.792
I've taken a couple of days off work.
I'm here just for you.

07:42.212 --> 07:48.093
Fine. Why don't you pick one thing
from each room that you want.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.848
Pick one thing, Mumma,
from-- from the kitchen. One thing.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.144
I want that good pan I use to make eggs.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.605
You want an egg pan?

08:00.731 --> 08:04.651
Listen. You wanna bring
stuff, you just take whatever you want.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.278
I'm not gonna remember any of it anyway.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.362
You--

08:09.531 --> 08:11.491
Mum, bring the egg pan. I--

09:46.128 --> 09:48.130
Why are you hunched over the sink
like that? What's wrong?

09:48.213 --> 09:50.799
I just-- I ate something. Something weird.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.975
So you've decided to come, have you?

10:00.976 --> 10:03.353
I've resigned myself,
if that's what you're getting at.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.606
You wanna bring anything else?

10:05.689 --> 10:07.983
Yes. I found something in my bedroom.

10:08.650 --> 10:09.484
What?

10:55.739 --> 10:58.951
You know, I think it's gonna be good
for the boys, you living with us.

11:05.249 --> 11:06.834
There are some schools
that have been studying

11:06.917 --> 11:09.795
the benefits of intergenerational living.

11:13.382 --> 11:14.967
They've come up with these campuses now,

11:15.050 --> 11:18.971
so senior living
and students all together.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.055
What schools?

11:20.639 --> 11:21.807
What?

11:21.890 --> 11:23.308
What schools are studying this?

11:25.394 --> 11:26.770
I read it in an article.

11:28.313 --> 11:32.442
What in? Marie Claire? Woman's Day?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.445
I thought you'd be interested.

11:35.946 --> 11:37.906
Can we just not talk?

11:37.990 --> 11:39.992
I mean, it's making me exhausted.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.076
All right.

11:48.792 --> 11:52.129
I get it. You're angry at me.
I'd be angry at me too.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.423
But we both decided
this is what's best for you.

11:54.506 --> 11:59.052
I had a momentary lapse in judgment,
and you took advantage of that.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.891
Well, it's decided now,

12:04.725 --> 12:06.685
so we may as well make the best of it.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.856
Let's make this into a road trip.

12:12.274 --> 12:13.483
Isn't that what we're doing?

12:13.567 --> 12:17.029
No. No. This is driving.
A road trip is fun.

12:31.043 --> 12:32.669
Where are we? Where are you taking me?

12:37.341 --> 12:39.218
I'm taking you wherever you wanna go.

12:42.012 --> 12:46.725
All right. Make your decision. Lunch.
Come on. You pick.

12:46.808 --> 12:49.770
Press the little knife and fork thingy.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.063
See what's around here.

12:53.273 --> 12:55.234
Wherever you wanna go. Sky's the limit.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.756
Oh, God. How depressing.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.968
Why are there so many ads
for funeral parlors?

14:05.470 --> 14:07.222
It's quite savvy if you ask me.

14:08.056 --> 14:09.099
Play to the crowd.

14:19.985 --> 14:22.154
What are you hunting for with that fork?
Just eat it.

14:22.237 --> 14:24.489
They put little bacon pieces in my salad.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.491
God, no. Not bacon.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.246
I'm vegetarian.

14:31.830 --> 14:32.831
Since when?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.876
I haven't eaten meat for ten years, Mum.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.963
I must've forgotten
with the dementia and all that.

14:48.514 --> 14:52.309
So, is Todd excited to go to uni?

14:53.769 --> 14:55.521
I don't know. I mean…

14:57.856 --> 15:01.318
he's very excited to have sex
with his girlfriend as much as possible.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.696
Well, of course. He's a teenage boy.

15:04.780 --> 15:05.906
What course is he doing?

15:06.782 --> 15:08.325
Arts. At Wollongong.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.663
It wasn't his first choice.

15:14.581 --> 15:16.875
-Wasn't my first choice.
-What did he wanna do?

15:18.001 --> 15:19.711
He didn't really know, to be honest.

15:19.795 --> 15:22.631
Well, why is he going?
I mean, uni's not for everyone.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.008
Oh, that's really rich coming from you.

15:25.092 --> 15:26.343
Well, it's too much pressure.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.429
When I dropped out,
you lost your shit, Mum.

15:29.513 --> 15:31.265
That was different. You were smart.

15:31.348 --> 15:32.599
Todd's smart.

15:32.683 --> 15:34.309
But you were distracted.

15:34.393 --> 15:36.645
-All right. Well, this isn't about me.
-Yeah, by Adam.

15:40.023 --> 15:41.900
At least I found something I love doing.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.652
All I'm saying is,

15:43.735 --> 15:46.238
if Todd's not a student,
then why force him into it?

15:46.321 --> 15:49.074
I'm not forcing him into doing anything.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.743
I thought you were supposed
to not get me agitated.

16:05.507 --> 16:07.134
What is that? What are you hiding there?

16:07.217 --> 16:08.302
It's an album.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.012
What album?

16:12.431 --> 16:14.141
You stole that from my house.

16:18.270 --> 16:19.813
Thought we could go through it together.

16:19.897 --> 16:24.985
Oh, right. You're trying
to trick me into memory aerobics.

16:26.820 --> 16:27.821
No.

16:31.241 --> 16:33.035
It's as much for me as it is for you.

16:35.579 --> 16:37.664
So many of these pictures are on holiday.

16:37.748 --> 16:39.625
You were little. That's what people do.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.004
Look at this.

16:44.963 --> 16:45.964
I hated that cat.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.176
-You did not.
-No, no. It pissed all over the house.

16:50.594 --> 16:52.221
Look at Dad. He looks so young.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.729
So funny. You're not in any of these.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.153
Well, of course I wasn't.

17:08.237 --> 17:10.821
I mean, who do you think was holding
the fucking camera?

17:10.906 --> 17:13.075
Oh, yeah. You're right.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.829
Just put the bloody album away.

17:23.961 --> 17:25.253
I'm gonna go to the loo.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.781
So, where are we going
on this epic adventure of ours?

18:37.117 --> 18:39.912
I don't know. I was gonna look up
somewhere fun nearby.

18:42.915 --> 18:44.374
We could drive along the coast.

18:48.420 --> 18:49.421
That's a big detour.

18:52.382 --> 18:54.051
I've always wanted to do that drive.

18:55.511 --> 18:57.554
If you're forcing me to enjoy myself.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.106
I thought it would be bigger.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.484
Well, the joke's on us.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.903
We went right out of our way
just to stand here.

19:12.986 --> 19:16.490
Come on. I love the bigs.
Don't you love the bigs?

19:16.573 --> 19:18.200
I mean, it doesn't even look
like a big potato.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.535
It looks like a big turd.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.454
This is so stupid.

19:25.123 --> 19:27.709
Well, it makes you smile.
Nothing stupid about that.

19:33.131 --> 19:35.384
I'm tired. I think I need to lie down.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.511
You wanna rest in the car?

19:38.887 --> 19:40.013
Can we stop somewhere?

19:41.098 --> 19:42.099
Yeah.

19:59.992 --> 20:00.993
Hey.

20:01.076 --> 20:05.414
Hey. How you doin'? You strangle her yet?

20:07.583 --> 20:08.834
It's not off the table.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.253
You okay?

20:11.336 --> 20:12.713
Yeah.

20:12.796 --> 20:16.466
She fell asleep at seven o'clock.
Like a baby.

20:16.550 --> 20:18.802
You sound tired too, babe.
You're not driving, are you?

20:18.886 --> 20:21.638
No. We had to stop
at a shitty little motel.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.015
She needed a break.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.684
Well, it sounds like
she's not the only one.

20:25.767 --> 20:28.896
I'm fine. What's happening there?

20:29.396 --> 20:31.064
You having a good time with the boys?

20:31.148 --> 20:34.359
Yeah, yeah. Boys are awesome.
They're in playing video games

20:34.443 --> 20:37.696
and I'm just--
I'm just making some adjustments

20:37.779 --> 20:39.823
to your-- your mum's bathroom cabinets.

20:41.033 --> 20:44.203
Adjustments? What's wrong with them?

20:45.204 --> 20:46.955
Just-- Just refurbishing the cabinets.

20:47.039 --> 20:49.124
You're refurbishing the cabinets now?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.542
Yeah. Well, I mean, your mum,

20:50.626 --> 20:52.544
she's always giving me shit
about the house,

20:52.628 --> 20:55.339
and I figured it's a good time
for a little face-lift.

20:56.131 --> 20:57.132
Okay.

20:57.216 --> 21:00.344
Well, can you make sure the face-lift
is done by the time we get back?

21:00.427 --> 21:04.765
It's just a few tweaks, honey.
I'm a professional. It's what I do.

21:04.848 --> 21:08.560
But, please. There's just--
There's enough chaos right now.

21:08.644 --> 21:09.811
It's gonna be worth it.

21:11.355 --> 21:14.233
You might wanna take
the long way home just to be sure.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.485
Love you. Bye.

23:49.304 --> 23:55.143
Happy birth--
Happy birthday to you

23:56.103 --> 24:01.108
Happy birthday, dear Robin
Happy…

24:40.606 --> 24:41.857
Oh, shit!

24:43.358 --> 24:45.027
Oh, shit. Mum.

24:45.903 --> 24:48.697
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

24:52.826 --> 24:53.827
Fuck.

24:54.536 --> 24:56.330
You forgot to put on your pants.

24:59.416 --> 25:03.670
I-- I thought you'd--
I thought you'd gone out.

25:04.630 --> 25:05.881
I was having a shower.

25:07.841 --> 25:09.468
Want me to fix your hair?

25:10.385 --> 25:11.470
That would be nice.

25:31.949 --> 25:35.160
-So, what are you doing there?
-I'm just giving it a bit of a swoop.

25:37.412 --> 25:39.164
Years of practice, you know?

25:41.041 --> 25:43.377
This is how I did your hair
for my wedding.

25:48.549 --> 25:49.550
Who did you marry?

25:55.222 --> 25:56.223
Adam.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.143
We met in high school.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.813
You've known him since he was 17.

26:08.569 --> 26:09.736
Are you happy?

26:10.320 --> 26:11.780
We're rolling along.

26:19.705 --> 26:20.706
Want a cup of tea?

26:23.208 --> 26:24.334
I think it looks great.

26:35.846 --> 26:39.308
Oh, fuck. Oh, shit.

27:07.252 --> 27:09.671
Wow. Gorgeous, isn't it?

27:14.426 --> 27:17.012
We came here 30 years ago, Mum.

27:18.138 --> 27:19.681
Nah, I've never been here before.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.686
Yes, you have. Yeah.

27:24.770 --> 27:26.688
You dragged Dad and I down that trail

27:26.772 --> 27:28.982
to the lookout
so you could take a picture.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.405
I'm gonna grab a jacket, Mumma.
Wait there.

28:03.517 --> 28:04.685
Shit.

28:15.946 --> 28:16.947
Mum?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.201
Mum?

28:23.704 --> 28:26.206
Did you see a woman? She w--

28:26.290 --> 28:28.000
No. She might've went to the lookout.

28:30.169 --> 28:31.170
Thank you.

28:31.670 --> 28:35.424
Mum? Mum?

28:37.676 --> 28:38.719
Mum!

28:42.723 --> 28:43.724
Mumma!

28:51.106 --> 28:52.107
Mum!

28:54.735 --> 28:55.736
Mum!

28:58.614 --> 28:59.823
Mum!

29:04.912 --> 29:05.913
Mum!

29:12.336 --> 29:15.130
Mum! Mum.

29:18.842 --> 29:19.843
Mum!

29:21.345 --> 29:24.723
Mum! Stay-- Stay there!

29:27.226 --> 29:28.727
Mumma, It's me.

29:35.108 --> 29:38.529
Hey. It's all right. I'm here.

29:42.783 --> 29:44.076
I don't know where I am.

29:48.163 --> 29:49.164
It's all right.

29:49.248 --> 29:51.500
Oh, God. What a mess. What a fucking mess.

29:56.964 --> 29:58.799
It's all right. Come on.

30:05.389 --> 30:06.765
Let's just get you home.

30:07.391 --> 30:08.392
Yeah.

30:43.051 --> 30:44.052
Okay.

30:45.554 --> 30:46.555
Here.

30:49.975 --> 30:51.310
All right. I got it, Mum.

30:51.935 --> 30:52.936
You go in.

30:54.938 --> 30:56.815
Hey, Rosie. Here, let me--
let me get that for you.

30:56.899 --> 30:59.902
-I'm good, thanks.
-She's coming in hot.

30:59.985 --> 31:01.320
-Oh, God.
-Hey, babe.

31:01.403 --> 31:03.572
-Hi. Here.
-Okay. I'll take this. You just go in.

31:03.655 --> 31:05.157
Have a cup of tea.

31:05.240 --> 31:07.117
Kids made a lovely sign. Yep.

31:07.201 --> 31:08.577
-They did?
-Yeah.

31:08.660 --> 31:09.870
Everything's unloaded.

31:10.579 --> 31:12.414
Boys are helping your mum
put her stuff away.

31:12.497 --> 31:13.498
Great.

31:13.582 --> 31:15.083
And she hasn't eaten them yet.

31:15.167 --> 31:17.628
She said to bring these upstairs.
Said they're yours.

31:22.216 --> 31:23.717
There's a lot of photos missing.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.556
-I ate them.
-What?

31:30.807 --> 31:31.808
I ate them.

31:31.892 --> 31:33.227
I couldn't help myself.

31:36.063 --> 31:37.064
Dad's gone.

31:37.898 --> 31:40.359
Mum's gonna forget everything soon, so I--

31:42.069 --> 31:44.613
There's just me. Just me.

31:46.156 --> 31:48.283
And I have to hold on to all of it, so…

31:59.294 --> 32:00.879
I'm not a daughter anymore.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.970
I'm at the end of being a mother.

32:12.182 --> 32:16.395
And I'm scared.
Looking ahead, I'm pretty scared.

32:23.235 --> 32:27.281
And I-- I don't really like
talking to her.

32:28.031 --> 32:30.951
I don't really like spending time
with her.

32:31.034 --> 32:36.123
And-- And I love her, but I don't-- I--

32:37.040 --> 32:38.500
I don't wanna lose her.

32:40.836 --> 32:43.839
Hey. You remember me?

32:43.922 --> 32:48.510
I'm that guy that did a pretty stellar job
at renovating that bathroom, by the way.

33:09.656 --> 33:11.200
I've missed you.

33:12.075 --> 33:15.245
Good, 'cause I've missed you too.

33:23.921 --> 33:27.466
Sorry. Sorry I've been all over the place.

33:27.549 --> 33:30.719
You have, but you're here now, right?

33:31.970 --> 33:33.222
We both are.

33:36.808 --> 33:37.809
Us.

33:40.521 --> 33:41.522
Yeah.

33:41.605 --> 33:42.606
God.

33:49.238 --> 33:50.531
-Mum's downstairs.
-Yeah.

33:51.490 --> 33:52.991
I don't think that she'll approve.

33:55.452 --> 33:57.871
We never got caught in high school.

33:57.955 --> 33:59.915
-And I think we know what we're doing.
-Yes, we did.

34:00.499 --> 34:01.500
Hey, Nan?

34:03.085 --> 34:06.004
When Todd goes to uni,
he's gonna give his Nintendo Switch.

34:06.088 --> 34:08.422
Wow. That's a pretty big deal, isn't it?

34:08.507 --> 34:11.385
Yeah. It's, like, the most important thing
in his life.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.637
Except for his girlfriend.

34:15.222 --> 34:16.223
Stop it.

34:17.306 --> 34:19.059
Do you want us to teach you how to play?

34:19.560 --> 34:20.686
I don't think so.

34:20.768 --> 34:22.728
-Okay.
-We could play cards.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.315
Rose, you remember you taught me
how to play poker,

34:25.399 --> 34:26.608
and we bet with coppers?

34:26.692 --> 34:27.693
Hey!

34:28.193 --> 34:29.444
What?

34:29.527 --> 34:32.364
Mum told us.
We're not supposed to say that word.

34:33.657 --> 34:34.658
What word?

34:35.367 --> 34:36.534
"Remember."

34:38.495 --> 34:41.248
Darling, it's okay.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.628
Here. Show me how to play
this bloody game.

34:46.712 --> 34:49.047
So get-- Go out of it. So go B.

34:49.130 --> 34:50.966
It's called The Legend of Zelda.

34:51.049 --> 34:52.551
"Zelda." That's a good name.

34:52.634 --> 34:54.761
What's-- What's your girlfriend's name?

34:54.844 --> 34:57.139
-It's Amy.
-Amy.

34:57.890 --> 34:59.641
So I hear Amy's a pretty good shag.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.102
Okay. Well, she's--

35:03.228 --> 35:04.688
She's quite nervous to meet you.

35:05.480 --> 35:07.024
-Is she?
-Very.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.111
Now, why am I just in a forest?

35:12.279 --> 35:13.322
Is this the game or…

35:13.405 --> 35:15.782
Yeah. Well, that's part of the game.
See, that's Link, right?

35:15.866 --> 35:17.159
He's been asleep for a hundred years,

35:17.242 --> 35:19.578
and he woke up
and doesn't remember anything.

35:19.661 --> 35:20.996
Now he's gotta regain his memory

35:21.079 --> 35:23.081
and then save the kingdom
from Calamity Ganon.

35:24.249 --> 35:26.752
I'm not talking about her.
I'm talking about Link.

35:28.003 --> 35:30.255
There's so much grass.

35:30.339 --> 35:31.381
Take him out.

35:34.593 --> 35:35.969
Go on. Show her the controls.

35:36.053 --> 35:39.348
Just go into the blue bit. Go up.
Yeah, turn around. Yeah, hit B.

35:39.431 --> 35:40.557
-B?
-The B-- No.

35:40.641 --> 35:42.351
-B.
-Yeah, there. Then turn around.

35:42.434 --> 35:45.312
-How do I turn around?
-She-- She knows who we are.

35:45.395 --> 35:46.813
The right stick?

35:46.897 --> 35:49.775
I was scared she wouldn't.
But I think she's having a good time.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.944
-But yeah, just go into that blue thing.
-Shit.

35:52.027 --> 35:52.986
Yeah, yeah.

35:53.070 --> 35:55.531
Now, if you stay straight,
then you might be able to…

35:56.657 --> 35:57.699
Take them down.
