00:18.643 --> 00:20.311
<i>In case you're wondering,</i>

00:20.395 --> 00:22.772
<i>I don't hold séances very often.</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:26.943
<i>I can barely tolerate the living.</i>
<i>Why would I want to commune with the dead?</i>

00:28.945 --> 00:30.071
<i>But my mother told me</i>

00:30.155 --> 00:34.117
<i>Goody is the only one that can train me</i>
<i>to control my psychic ability.</i>

00:34.200 --> 00:37.662
<i>The sooner I master that,</i>
<i>the sooner I crack this case.</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:57.182
Sorry.

00:57.265 --> 00:59.267
I didn't mean to interrupt your…

00:59.350 --> 01:01.936
Uh, do I even want to know?

01:02.520 --> 01:05.023
I was reaching into the black maw
of death to contact a relative.

01:06.107 --> 01:09.402
Feels very on-brand for you.
You have a relative named Goody?

01:09.486 --> 01:11.613
She was one of the original outcasts.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.281
Been attempting to summon her,

01:13.364 --> 01:15.658
but she seems to be
ignoring my entreaties.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.328
Oh, you thought about
using one of my scented candles?

01:18.411 --> 01:21.372
The aroma of steak tartare is to die for.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.711
Maybe Goody answered you after all.

01:31.299 --> 01:33.510
I doubt she communicates
in magazine cutouts.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.532
You insisted on coming along.

01:56.407 --> 01:57.784
I was fine on my own.

02:11.548 --> 02:14.259
Seems like our wannabe Deep Throat
is already here.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.303
Ew.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.180
What died?

02:19.264 --> 02:20.765
Smells like childhood.

02:21.766 --> 02:22.809
Come on.

02:22.892 --> 02:25.270
Second thoughts.
Why don't I just stay out here?

02:28.857 --> 02:30.400
You know, as a lookout.

03:00.597 --> 03:01.431
Enid?

03:14.444 --> 03:16.487
Whoever you are, show yourself.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.532
Try anything and you'll lose limbs.

03:20.533 --> 03:21.951
Surprise!

03:44.891 --> 03:46.809
I should have known you were behind this.

03:47.602 --> 03:50.980
What part of "no party under the penalty
of death" do you not understand?

03:52.523 --> 03:55.068
I thought my cake design
was pretty inspired.

03:55.151 --> 03:57.195
The pink balloon was my little touch.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.030
Why don't you make a wish?

04:03.952 --> 04:05.453
Wait, it's Latin.

04:07.747 --> 04:11.376
Fire will rain… when I rise.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.961
That's not really a wish.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.548
The first part of that
was burned onto Nevermore's lawn.

04:18.424 --> 04:19.842
It can't be a coincidence.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.637
Wait, we're never eating that cake,
are we?

04:36.943 --> 04:38.611
<i>Crackstone is coming.</i>

04:40.863 --> 04:42.240
Crackstone is coming.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.920
-Goody.
You're the Raven in my bloodline.

04:57.088 --> 04:58.339
Wednesday.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.967
I was told you could teach me
how to control my ability.

05:01.050 --> 05:03.219
There is no controlling a raging river.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.556
You must learn to navigate it
without drowning.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.141
Time is not on our side.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.479
To stop Crackstone,
this place you must seek.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.984
Do you always speak in riddles?

05:18.067 --> 05:19.652
Do you always seek simple answers?

05:21.195 --> 05:22.989
The path of a Raven is a solitary one.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.491
You end up alone, unable to trust others,

05:25.575 --> 05:27.660
only seeing the darkness within them.

05:28.453 --> 05:30.038
Is that supposed to scare me?

05:30.788 --> 05:31.831
It should.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.892
Careful, that's my cold shoulder.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.478
Don't blame Thing.
The party was my idea.

05:53.978 --> 05:56.356
Everyone deserves
to be celebrated on their birthday.

05:56.439 --> 05:58.149
I prefer to be vilified.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.735
What happened?
It looked like you were having a seizure.

06:01.444 --> 06:02.653
I wasn't that lucky.

06:03.863 --> 06:06.741
Can I at least get some kudos
for pulling one over on you?

06:07.700 --> 06:09.369
The subterfuge was impressive.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.265
"May your 16th be as sour
and misery-filled as your desire."

06:31.349 --> 06:33.184
"Your ever-doting mother and father."

06:33.267 --> 06:36.562
They asked Thing to hide it
before they left on Parents' Weekend.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.856
Ew! That's so gross.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.817
I would've preferred live squirrels.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.239
While we're still accepting presents…

07:01.337 --> 07:03.631
Well, do you like it?

07:05.174 --> 07:06.134
What is it exactly?

07:06.217 --> 07:07.844
It's a snood, silly.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.971
I made it in your signature colors.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.306
And you want to know
what the best part is?

07:13.266 --> 07:14.600
I have one too!

07:15.893 --> 07:18.020
We can wear them together to class.

07:18.604 --> 07:22.942
Oh, Enid, this is far too unique
to wear to something like class.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.570
I suggest we wait for
a more special occasion,

07:26.821 --> 07:28.364
like a funeral.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.116
Oh.

07:32.034 --> 07:35.413
You know, Lucas feels terrible
about what happened at the dance.

07:35.496 --> 07:39.834
Forgive my skepticism,
given his latest act of vandalism.

07:39.917 --> 07:43.129
He had nothing to do with burning
those words onto your lawn.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.089
He's been grounded for the last week.

07:46.883 --> 07:47.717
Fine.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.597
He does his community service here,
and we forget it ever happened.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.639
Yes, well…

07:54.432 --> 07:56.058
I'm in your debt, Larissa.

07:56.559 --> 07:58.644
I don't need your gratitude.

07:58.728 --> 08:02.398
Just find the delinquents responsible.
Perhaps start with Lucas's cohorts.

08:02.482 --> 08:05.860
Right after we track down
whatever attacked the Ottinger boy.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.906
Although all fingers would point
to one of your own students.

08:09.989 --> 08:11.240
Careful, Noble.

08:12.200 --> 08:14.327
My charity has its limits.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.758
In the crypt,
you had another vision, didn't you?

08:28.841 --> 08:31.427
I didn't realize we were
back on speaking terms.

08:31.511 --> 08:34.347
I showed up to your surprise party.
I figured that would have been a hint.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.518
-What did you see?
-Who said I was ready to speak with you?

08:40.394 --> 08:41.812
Still think I'm the monster?

08:41.896 --> 08:43.272
Haven't ruled it out.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.150
When you change your mind
and you want my help,

08:46.234 --> 08:47.693
you know where to find me.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.219
Where'd you get that?

09:14.387 --> 09:16.514
The bracelet, where'd you get it?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.351
Lucas. Nice to meet you.

09:20.935 --> 09:21.936
Bianca.

09:22.019 --> 09:22.979
I know.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.774
Last week at the Weathervane,
my dad said I had to get my act together.

09:26.857 --> 09:28.526
After he left,
this woman in the next booth

09:28.609 --> 09:31.904
told me about
this self-help app, MorningSong.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.532
Said it could help me refocus my life.

09:34.615 --> 09:36.909
Usually I'd call BS
on something like that,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.286
but for some reason--

09:38.369 --> 09:39.620
You believed her.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.999
Yeah, and she turned out to be right,
so I signed up.

09:43.624 --> 09:44.875
And they sent me this.

09:46.085 --> 09:49.046
I guarantee MorningSong
doesn't give a damn about your well-being.

09:49.130 --> 09:51.007
They're only interested in your money.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.385
Do yourself a favor. Delete that app.

09:54.468 --> 09:57.221
The more you listen to them,
the more they sink their claws into you.

09:58.097 --> 09:58.973
How do you know?

09:59.557 --> 10:00.808
I just do.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.688
Which is why I'm warning the normie idiot
who ruined my killer dress

10:05.771 --> 10:07.481
with his bullshit prank

10:07.565 --> 10:09.400
to not get sucked into MorningSong.

10:10.151 --> 10:12.361
Because you're just the type
they're looking for.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.031
Guessing that's not a compliment.

10:15.906 --> 10:17.199
What do you care, anyway?

10:17.700 --> 10:19.827
I'm trying not to turn into my mother.

10:20.328 --> 10:23.205
She's like the ghost of bitchiness future.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.083
Hey.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.837
I'll be at the Weathervane later,
if you want to stop by.

10:29.920 --> 10:33.466
Maybe we can exchange
notes on self-improvement.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.934
I haven't always been against birthdays.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.730
Each one reminds me I'm a year closer
to death's cold embrace.

10:49.273 --> 10:50.775
What's not to like about that?

10:52.151 --> 10:55.071
Besides, my parents always made sure
my birthdays were memorable.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.285
<i>The perfect surprise.</i>

11:04.205 --> 11:05.706
<i>The perfect cake.</i>

11:06.916 --> 11:09.752
Candy! Candy! Candy!

11:09.835 --> 11:11.128
<i>The perfect party games.</i>

11:11.212 --> 11:14.173
Candy! Candy! Candy!

11:26.894 --> 11:29.939
But now parties
and presents and games, it…

11:33.484 --> 11:35.069
it all feels so trivial.

11:37.405 --> 11:39.615
Goody warned me
I was destined to be alone,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.242
and that I would be sorry for it.

11:44.870 --> 11:45.705
Dr. Kinbott.

11:46.288 --> 11:48.499
I haven't seen you
since our session with your family,

11:48.582 --> 11:51.377
which was… certainly one I won't forget.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.421
How are things with them?

11:53.504 --> 11:55.506
My mother and I spent
some quality time together.

11:56.173 --> 11:57.967
-Got our hands dirty.
-Gardening?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.176
Grave-digging.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.344
Hmm.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.513
And I managed
to keep my father out of prison.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.058
What brings you here?

12:07.184 --> 12:09.228
Eugene's moms, I'm working with them.

12:09.311 --> 12:12.314
Trauma like this leaves
emotional scars on the whole family.

12:13.149 --> 12:16.777
They had to head home for a few days,
so I promised I'd check in on him.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.655
I'll leave you to it.

12:21.282 --> 12:22.408
Who's Goody?

12:27.163 --> 12:28.831
She's a very distant cousin.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.750
<i>Very </i>distant.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.419
Sounds like she doesn't see you
for who you really are.

12:33.502 --> 12:35.379
She sees more than you know.

12:39.675 --> 12:42.762
I want to assure you I remain as cold
and heartless as the first day we met.

12:43.637 --> 12:46.807
I doubt a cold, heartless person
would be sitting by her friend's bedside

12:46.891 --> 12:48.726
feeling guilt for his condition.

12:48.809 --> 12:50.436
I didn't ask for a free session.

12:50.519 --> 12:52.772
Consider it my birthday gift.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.242
Come in.

13:07.578 --> 13:09.079
This just arrived from London.

13:09.163 --> 13:11.457
Copy of an old death certificate
you requested.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.083
Thanks, Agnes.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.377
Oh, by the way,
has Inez Bloom called again?

13:15.461 --> 13:17.922
You mean about the lights
at the old Gates place?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.591
Couple days ago.
I referred her to the sheriff's office.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.400
I know you're usually a quad kind of girl,
but I've been working on that all week.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.320
Birthday, yes.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.238
Happy, never.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.241
Is there anyone Thing didn't tell?

13:45.324 --> 13:47.284
Well, who do you think delivered the cake?

13:48.327 --> 13:50.788
Yeah, I went with
the 98% dark chocolate ganache

13:50.871 --> 13:54.083
knowing your… preferred color palette.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.340
Oh, is that, uh… that Enid's gift?

14:01.423 --> 14:04.385
It's perfect if you're fleeing
a war-torn country on foot.

14:04.468 --> 14:06.428
Come on. Don't you like a day
that's all about you?

14:06.512 --> 14:08.138
Every day is all about me.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.349
This one just comes
with cake and a bad song.

14:12.601 --> 14:16.355
So, if I asked you out
to a non-birthday, song-free dinner…

14:18.357 --> 14:20.401
would that be something
you're interested in?

14:23.904 --> 14:25.406
I have a tight deadline.

14:25.489 --> 14:26.699
Emphasis on dead.

14:27.533 --> 14:28.492
Term paper?

14:29.702 --> 14:33.330
It's about how whitewashing the sins
of our past will come back to kill us all.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.249
Oh.

14:46.427 --> 14:47.887
Have you seen that before?

14:48.470 --> 14:49.346
Uh…

14:49.847 --> 14:51.473
What's that supposed to be?

14:52.808 --> 14:53.809
Never mind.

14:58.981 --> 15:01.358
Okay, did… did I do something?

15:02.568 --> 15:06.071
I just feel like ever since the Rave'N,
you've kind of been ghosting me.

15:06.864 --> 15:07.823
Am I wrong?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.205
Guess I got my answer.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.337
Tall, black, two sugars, to go?

15:25.382 --> 15:27.927
That threat burned onto
the lawn at school,

15:28.010 --> 15:30.721
it's also etched on the wall
inside Crackstone's crypt.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.432
Don't tell me you've been
digging up more bodies.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.351
There's a connection there. I know it.

15:36.685 --> 15:39.104
I'll put out an APB on the dead pilgrim.

15:39.188 --> 15:42.066
I figured since you no longer have
an old vendetta to obsess over,

15:42.149 --> 15:44.026
you're free to solve some real crime.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.988
Your father and I buried the hatchet.
Maybe you should do the same.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.783
I don't bury hatchets.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.868
I sharpen them.

16:09.093 --> 16:10.302
I need your help.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.347
-Don't gloat.
-What, do you want some drawing lessons?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.144
Your line work's a little shaky.

16:19.895 --> 16:22.439
I saw that in a vision.
Do you recognize it?

16:31.281 --> 16:32.783
When did you draw this?

16:32.866 --> 16:33.993
Couple days ago.

16:34.576 --> 16:37.538
I started having those dreams again,
like before.

16:37.621 --> 16:38.998
Was the monster in them?

16:39.498 --> 16:43.085
No, but I could feel it in the shadows.

16:43.168 --> 16:45.045
You know, kind of lurking in my mind.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.298
You know where this is?

16:48.382 --> 16:50.175
Yeah. It's the old Gates mansion.

16:50.676 --> 16:52.177
I pass it when I go running.

16:54.013 --> 16:54.847
Why?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.360
Okay. Listen…

17:12.281 --> 17:15.784
After the dance, I just wanted
to forget about you, but I couldn't.

17:16.744 --> 17:19.079
So I started painting
and that's what came out.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.834
I can hear you up there playing.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.302
I can tell how you get lost in the music.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.264
I feel like it's the only time
I get to see the real you.

17:56.450 --> 17:58.285
You're Bianca, right?

17:59.953 --> 18:01.872
Uh, could you do me a favor?

18:01.955 --> 18:04.208
Wednesday forgot this.
Could you give it back to her?

18:04.792 --> 18:06.293
Birthday gift from Enid.

18:06.794 --> 18:07.961
Aren't you her boyfriend?

18:09.713 --> 18:10.714
Definitely not.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.300
Sure, no problem.

18:14.051 --> 18:15.677
I was just leaving anyway.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.560
Didn't think you were
actually going to show.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.853
Me neither.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.151
Took your advice.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.447
Seriously, why are you here?

18:35.531 --> 18:38.408
I didn't think any outcast
would ever speak to me again.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.831
Just… wanted someone to talk to.

18:43.914 --> 18:45.958
I feel like we're in the same boat.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.921
My mother showed up last week to remind me
that sirens can never change their scales.

18:51.505 --> 18:53.090
No matter how hard I try,

18:53.173 --> 18:55.717
there will always be people
who look down on me.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.970
My mission is to prove her wrong.

18:59.012 --> 19:00.639
I just figured you could relate.

19:04.726 --> 19:08.480
Most people think
I'll never amount to anything.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.569
And while we're being honest, I haven't
done much to make them think differently.

19:15.487 --> 19:17.322
Why did you trash the dance?

19:17.406 --> 19:18.532
I don't know.

19:19.658 --> 19:23.078
Guess I was angry that my dad
was humiliated on Outreach Day.

19:23.912 --> 19:25.122
Wanted payback.

19:25.205 --> 19:26.623
But then after we did it,

19:27.708 --> 19:29.293
I kind of felt like crap.

19:29.376 --> 19:32.713
I realized I needed to wipe the board,
you know? Start over.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.174
If that makes any sense.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.761
More than you know.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.646
<i>This is</i>
<i>where Garrett Gates lived.</i>

19:50.147 --> 19:52.649
<i>The boy my father</i>
<i>was accused of murdering.</i>

19:54.359 --> 19:58.906
<i>The sheriff told me his family died,</i>
<i>along with their legacy of hate.</i>

20:00.240 --> 20:02.075
<i>But ghosts don't kill the living.</i>

20:03.285 --> 20:05.495
<i>Goody showed me this house for a reason.</i>

20:05.579 --> 20:07.080
<i>I need to unlock its secrets,</i>

20:07.956 --> 20:08.957
<i>or die trying.</i>

20:47.871 --> 20:49.289
I need a distraction.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.752
Sheriff, pick up your damn phone,
it's Noble.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.713
Listen, I might have figured out
who's behind all of this.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.801
It's a long shot.
I'm gonna have to lay it out for you.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.138
We'll do it over pie at the Weathervane,
just like the old days.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.182
See you soon.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.691
-No!

22:04.865 --> 22:05.699
Noble!

22:11.079 --> 22:12.331
Call 911!

22:13.123 --> 22:14.541
Get an ambulance!

22:20.505 --> 22:21.506
He's alive.

22:22.424 --> 22:23.342
Barely.

22:24.968 --> 22:27.220
I'll take you back
after I get your statement.

22:27.304 --> 22:29.014
I already gave it to your deputy.

22:29.556 --> 22:31.433
Blue Cadillac with no license plates.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.393
Yeah, I know.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.813
I want a better one.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.816
What were you doing in the mayor's SUV?

22:39.900 --> 22:41.985
I saw him coming out of the Gates mansion.

22:42.069 --> 22:45.113
The Gates mansion.
What the hell were you doing there?

22:45.197 --> 22:46.073
House hunting.

22:49.451 --> 22:51.370
I overheard the voicemail he left you.

22:51.953 --> 22:52.913
I was intrigued.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.291
Back when the mayor was sheriff,

22:56.375 --> 23:00.087
he used to have a lot of wild theories
on cases that he couldn't solve.

23:00.170 --> 23:04.383
So… we'd dissect them over pie,
sitting right back there in that booth.

23:04.466 --> 23:06.843
Most of the time they went nowhere.

23:06.927 --> 23:08.303
Call me old-fashioned,

23:08.387 --> 23:11.723
but when someone is run over on their way
to give the police key information,

23:11.807 --> 23:13.850
it usually means they were onto something<i>.</i>

23:13.934 --> 23:17.020
And all signs point
to the Gates family and that house.

23:17.104 --> 23:18.188
The Gates family.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.982
How? They're all dead.
Every last one of them.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.527
-And I don't believe in ghosts.
-Maybe you should.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.286
How do you end up at the center

23:33.370 --> 23:35.622
of every terrible thing that happens here?

23:35.705 --> 23:36.957
Incredible luck.

23:37.541 --> 23:39.876
As of now, the school is on full lockdown,

23:40.377 --> 23:43.672
and your off-campus privileges
are revoked until further notice.

23:54.766 --> 23:59.062
Wednesday, I just heard
what happened to Mayor Walker.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.566
Are you all right? I… I can't imagine
witnessing something like that.

24:02.649 --> 24:04.401
-It was on my bucket list.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.571
You can tell the warden
I'm still in my cell.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.700
Principal Weems is
only looking out for your best interests.

24:11.783 --> 24:15.078
You could have been
seriously hurt or worse.

24:18.748 --> 24:21.001
Oh. How goes the novel?

24:21.960 --> 24:24.421
Viper's investigation has been
thwarted on several fronts,

24:24.504 --> 24:26.798
but she's plotting
her next course of action.

24:28.633 --> 24:29.926
Sounds intriguing.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.763
I saw this on my bookshelf
and thought of you.

24:35.265 --> 24:38.226
Mary Shelley wrote it on a dare
when she was only 19.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.311
I know.

24:39.895 --> 24:42.397
She's both my literary hero and nemesis,

24:43.148 --> 24:45.442
and I have two years
and 364 days to beat her.

24:46.443 --> 24:50.155
Well, I think it's very smart
that you're focusing on literary monsters,

24:50.238 --> 24:53.366
and leaving whatever real ones
might be out there to the authorities.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.661
"No man chooses evil because it is evil."

24:56.745 --> 24:59.372
"He only mistakes it for happiness,
the good he seeks."

24:59.456 --> 25:02.375
Mary Shelley wrote that line
to describe people like Weems,

25:02.459 --> 25:05.045
who do bad things under the guise
of protecting the greater good.

25:06.296 --> 25:07.589
Did she put you up to this?

25:07.672 --> 25:09.966
Encourage me to pursue other interests?

25:10.050 --> 25:10.884
No.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.471
But she will expel you
if you continue to defy her.

25:15.889 --> 25:18.099
So you're only looking out
for my best interests?

25:18.683 --> 25:19.643
Always.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.103
-I think we're a lot alike.
-We aren't.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.192
I don't need your help or your pity.
I already have a mother and a therapist.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.069
That's enough torture, even for me.

25:50.340 --> 25:51.174
Hello?

25:51.758 --> 25:55.136
-I've reconsidered your offer.
<i>My offer?</i>

25:55.220 --> 25:56.471
The non-birthday dinner.

25:57.973 --> 25:59.891
Really? That's great. Um…

26:01.518 --> 26:02.602
When are you free?

26:02.686 --> 26:05.021
<i>Pick me up outside</i>
<i>the Nevermore gates at 8:00.</i>

26:05.605 --> 26:06.648
Cut your lights.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.151
Uh… Wednesday?

26:11.778 --> 26:13.446
Ty? What did I tell you?

26:14.030 --> 26:16.283
Come on, bud,
steer clear of Wednesday Addams.

26:16.366 --> 26:18.451
She's the kind of girl
who's gonna get you hurt.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.245
Believe me, I know the type.

26:21.329 --> 26:23.164
Is that supposed to be about Mom?

26:24.374 --> 26:28.044
Of course not. That would require you
to actually talk about her.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.682
I can't deal with this right now.

26:41.182 --> 26:44.019
I gotta get to the hospital.
I gotta check on the mayor.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.520
Be home before curfew.

26:45.604 --> 26:47.188
Did you ever even love her?

26:53.278 --> 26:55.071
More than you could ever know.

27:07.042 --> 27:09.961
I've been thinking about
my less-than-enthusiastic response

27:10.045 --> 27:11.463
to your surprise soirée.

27:11.963 --> 27:12.964
And I must admit,

27:13.048 --> 27:15.842
I regret not showing my gratitude
towards you more appropriately.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.764
-You really mean it?
-Take the win, Enid.

27:21.348 --> 27:22.641
If only there were a way for us

27:22.724 --> 27:25.226
to get off campus
and have a little birthday redo.

27:26.269 --> 27:27.771
Just two best friends.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.774
Too bad the school is on lockdown.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.153
Would you look at that full moon…

27:38.281 --> 27:42.285
Oh, how about I say I'm about to wolf out
and get a pass to the lupin cages?

27:42.369 --> 27:44.287
And say you volunteered to lock me in.

27:44.913 --> 27:47.082
My deviousness
has finally rubbed off on you.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.917
-Thing?

27:50.585 --> 27:52.087
You know what to do, right?

27:56.466 --> 27:58.677
Oh, we should wear our snoods.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.556
Oh, I… I believe I left mine at fencing.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.975
Actually, you left yours
at the Weathervane.

28:06.059 --> 28:07.560
Luckily, Bianca brought it back.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.271
Like a monkey's paw.

28:24.994 --> 28:25.995
Jeez!

28:29.207 --> 28:30.041
Let's go.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.960
Uh… Uh…

28:32.043 --> 28:34.295
Hi. Nice to see you too.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.679
Wait, he's our Uber driver?

28:42.762 --> 28:43.930
Uber driver?

28:44.848 --> 28:48.184
-I thought we were going on a date.
-I thought this was a girls' night out.

28:48.268 --> 28:50.061
There's been a change of plans.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.398
What's up with the weird
matching hoodie scarf things?

28:53.481 --> 28:54.566
Don't ask.

28:54.649 --> 28:55.650
Just drive.

29:12.834 --> 29:13.793
Hey, Wednesday?

29:16.796 --> 29:17.881
Are you guys in here?

29:19.132 --> 29:21.134
I know you're still mad
about the painting,

29:21.217 --> 29:23.178
but I just want to talk
to you for a second.

29:32.437 --> 29:34.189
-Where is she, Thing?

29:42.989 --> 29:46.034
Seriously, you wanna go in there?

29:47.076 --> 29:48.578
This place is creepy AF.

29:48.661 --> 29:49.662
I know.

29:51.706 --> 29:54.584
-Okay. This isn't what I signed on for.
-Ditto.

29:54.667 --> 29:58.630
I didn't want to celebrate my birthday
by going to dinner or a surprise party.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.300
I want to do this.

30:03.843 --> 30:07.222
Then you shoulda just said so.
You didn't have to trick us.

30:08.556 --> 30:10.225
If you want to go, you can.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
I'm going to go check out the garage.

30:36.709 --> 30:37.710
Let me try.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.056
This is pointless.

30:50.890 --> 30:51.891
Can I try?

30:57.814 --> 30:58.815
Whoa.

31:02.777 --> 31:03.736
Werewolf thing.

31:14.289 --> 31:15.498
This hit the mayor.

31:16.499 --> 31:18.459
Okay. This just took a dark turn.

31:19.544 --> 31:22.005
We need to call Tyler's dad
right freaking now.

31:22.755 --> 31:23.590
Why?

31:24.173 --> 31:27.135
So he can take me back to Nevermore
and get me expelled?

31:27.218 --> 31:28.428
It's not gonna happen.

31:39.606 --> 31:41.399
This is the night I'm gonna die.

32:01.586 --> 32:04.422
<i>Here they are.</i>
<i>The Gates family.</i>

32:05.048 --> 32:07.008
<i>They scrub up well for psychopaths.</i>

32:08.468 --> 32:09.594
<i>There's Garrett,</i>

32:10.887 --> 32:12.722
<i>his outcast-hating father, Ansel,</i>

32:13.222 --> 32:14.849
<i>and you must be Laurel.</i>

32:14.933 --> 32:16.559
<i>They're all long gone.</i>

32:16.643 --> 32:17.936
<i>So the question is,</i>

32:19.312 --> 32:21.147
<i>why did Goody lead me here?</i>

32:46.881 --> 32:47.840
Seen enough?

33:15.868 --> 33:19.330
Who doesn't have a spooky built-in altar
in their family library?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.082
Ours is in the living room.

33:21.165 --> 33:23.668
More seating for year-long
<i>Dia de los Muertos.</i>

33:47.233 --> 33:48.067
They're still warm.

33:49.944 --> 33:52.363
Tyler, you check
the rest of the ground floor.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.198
Enid and I will search upstairs.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.324
We will?

34:10.423 --> 34:13.176
All right, you go left, I go right.

34:13.259 --> 34:16.012
You seriously want to split up? In here?

34:16.512 --> 34:19.515
That is literally how every best friend
dies in a horror movie.

34:19.599 --> 34:22.060
The faster we search,
the sooner you can leave.

34:29.525 --> 34:31.444
Why am I even here?

34:35.907 --> 34:37.617
I know what my mom would say.

34:38.618 --> 34:40.453
"Enid, you're a doormat."

34:42.205 --> 34:43.331
"You're too needy."

34:44.373 --> 34:47.585
"Show some teeth.
Nobody likes a desperate little furball."

34:47.668 --> 34:49.337
Shut up, Mom. Get out of my head!

34:56.469 --> 34:59.013
Wednesday, you need to see this.

35:10.608 --> 35:11.859
The bed's made.

35:12.652 --> 35:14.153
No dust or cobwebs…

35:21.953 --> 35:22.995
"LG?"

35:31.546 --> 35:32.713
Laurel Gates.

35:34.173 --> 35:36.884
Looks like somebody moved back
into their old room.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.261
It's not possible.

35:39.053 --> 35:41.430
She died 25 years ago, drowned overseas.

35:43.683 --> 35:44.767
Let's go.

35:45.935 --> 35:48.563
This is officially
the worst girls' night out ever!

35:49.438 --> 35:51.023
Guys! Get out! It's here!

35:57.071 --> 35:58.489
The dumbwaiter. Go!

36:06.581 --> 36:09.876
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.521
No, not your snood!

36:31.230 --> 36:32.315
Stop.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.822
Oh my God.

37:35.002 --> 37:36.003
What are you doing?

37:37.213 --> 37:39.215
These are the body parts
from the monster's victims.

37:39.298 --> 37:40.132
Come on.

37:50.059 --> 37:52.144
-You okay?
-Since when do you care?

37:56.565 --> 37:58.192
Wednesday, what the hell are you thinking?

37:58.276 --> 38:00.361
We have to go back for Tyler!

38:00.987 --> 38:02.363
The monster's there!

38:06.617 --> 38:07.785
Enid, hold this.

38:07.868 --> 38:10.329
-That thing is still inside!
-You're hurt. Can you walk?

38:12.373 --> 38:13.708
Where'd you come from?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.376
Here.

38:15.459 --> 38:16.377
Take this.

38:18.170 --> 38:19.547
What happened to him?

38:29.765 --> 38:30.891
Thanks, Doc.

38:31.392 --> 38:33.060
Not to make this about me,

38:33.144 --> 38:35.604
but I am having
a full-blown panic attack now.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.941
We need to get back
before Weems realizes we've been gone.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.862
What the hell happened?

38:43.446 --> 38:46.574
-This was you, wasn't it?
-Wait, Dad, please. I'm okay.

38:47.158 --> 38:50.244
Sheriff, I understand you're upset,
but I think you need to see something.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.341
It was all here.

39:04.175 --> 39:08.220
The… The… The body parts
and the blue Cadillac, the altar,

39:08.304 --> 39:10.556
and the bedroom filled with fresh roses.

39:10.639 --> 39:12.141
Yeah, well, it's all gone now.

39:12.224 --> 39:14.435
Somebody cleared this place out
after we left.

39:15.269 --> 39:19.148
Listen, yesterday I told you all signs
pointed to this house, and I was right.

39:19.231 --> 39:23.778
That your justification for almost getting
my son and your friends killed? Huh?

39:25.529 --> 39:26.989
Now, you listen to me.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.826
From this point forward,
you are forbidden from seeing Tyler,

39:30.910 --> 39:35.498
and you are forbidden from pursuing
anything to do with this case, understood?

39:48.594 --> 39:53.557
You directly violated my explicit order
and left campus during a lockdown.

39:54.141 --> 39:57.436
Not to mention putting your peers
and yourself in danger.

39:58.145 --> 40:00.398
Which is grounds for expulsion. I know.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.651
And you have every right
to exercise that option.

40:04.693 --> 40:07.113
I do believe it would be
a grave error on your part.

40:08.989 --> 40:13.452
I think contrition might be in order
right now, Miss Addams. Not hubris.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.163
I'll never apologize
for trying to uncover a truth.

40:25.673 --> 40:26.757
What is this?

40:27.800 --> 40:29.135
It's a warning from Rowan.

40:39.103 --> 40:40.980
Is this why he tried to kill you?

40:41.772 --> 40:43.774
His mother drew it before she died.

40:43.858 --> 40:45.985
Said I was destined to destroy the school.

40:47.069 --> 40:48.612
But I think I'm meant to save it.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.365
Now you know what's at stake.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.534
Everything you vowed to protect, no less.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.078
I think I deserve another chance.

41:00.291 --> 41:01.125
Please.

41:13.345 --> 41:15.014
One more infraction…

41:16.807 --> 41:20.311
One more step out of line
and you will be expelled.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.521
No ifs, no buts.

41:23.105 --> 41:26.609
-Enid and Xavier are spared as well.
-And no more negotiation.

41:27.109 --> 41:28.110
Good night.

41:41.707 --> 41:42.917
Where are you going?

41:43.000 --> 41:43.959
Yoko's room.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.213
Thornhill said I could
crash there for a few nights.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.256
There's no need.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.051
I spoke with Weems.
You and Xavier won't be punished.

41:52.134 --> 41:53.511
Am I supposed to thank you?

41:54.011 --> 41:56.639
I already apologized. It's over.

41:58.807 --> 41:59.808
Over?

42:00.601 --> 42:04.730
Tonight was the icing on the birthday cake
you couldn't even be bothered to cut.

42:05.648 --> 42:09.401
You'll use anyone to get what you want,
even if it means putting them in danger.

42:10.110 --> 42:12.947
We could have died tonight
because of your stupid obsession.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.281
But we didn't.

42:15.324 --> 42:17.785
And now
I'm one step closer to solving this case.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.328
That is what is important.

42:23.165 --> 42:24.750
I've tried

42:24.833 --> 42:25.668
really,

42:25.751 --> 42:26.794
really,

42:26.877 --> 42:28.796
really hard to be your friend.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.382
Always put myself out there.

42:32.007 --> 42:34.134
Thought of your feelings. Told people,

42:34.218 --> 42:37.388
"I know she gives off serial killer vibes,
but she's just shy."

42:37.471 --> 42:38.681
I never asked you to do that.

42:38.764 --> 42:41.058
You didn't have to
because that's what friends do!

42:41.642 --> 42:43.060
They don't have to be asked.

42:44.478 --> 42:47.106
The fact that you don't know that
says everything.

42:48.941 --> 42:51.527
You want to be alone, Wednesday? Be alone.

43:25.185 --> 43:27.771
<i>Goody warned</i>
<i>I was destined to be alone.</i>

43:28.731 --> 43:29.982
<i>Maybe it's inevitable.</i>

43:31.358 --> 43:33.360
<i>But for the first time in my life,</i>

43:34.612 --> 43:35.988
<i>it doesn't feel good.</i>

43:45.039 --> 43:46.707
<i>There's also something else.</i>

43:48.250 --> 43:49.877
<i>A gnawing feeling.</i>

43:53.130 --> 43:54.715
<i>That death is close at hand.</i>

43:57.468 --> 43:58.385
<i>Watching me.</i>

44:17.738 --> 44:20.949
<i>But I won't be intimidated.</i>
<i>And I will never give up.</i>

44:24.995 --> 44:25.996
<i>That house.</i>

44:26.830 --> 44:28.207
<i>That family.</i>

44:30.000 --> 44:31.043
<i>Crackstone.</i>

44:33.253 --> 44:34.797
<i>The monster.</i>

44:35.381 --> 44:36.507
<i>Somehow me.</i>

44:37.841 --> 44:41.053
<i>We all seem to be connected</i>
<i>like a spider's web.</i>

44:44.306 --> 44:47.142
<i>And when Mayor Walker</i>
<i>got too close to the truth,</i>

44:48.143 --> 44:49.353
<i>he was silenced.</i>

44:53.273 --> 44:54.650
<i>But I won't be.</i>

45:01.198 --> 45:02.533
<i>So whoever's watching me,</i>

45:04.159 --> 45:05.369
<i>know this.</i>

45:08.789 --> 45:10.124
<i>I will find you.</i>
