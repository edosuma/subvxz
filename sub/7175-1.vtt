put a crimp on it.

Oh, yeah? How'd I do that?

31:57.217 --> 32:00.797
By killing Alice Morgan.
Or having her killed.

Same difference, really.

32:06.162 --> 32:08.846
Don't tell me you don't
know who she is, George.

32:12.787 --> 32:16.781
Mate, I didn't put her down.
Or have her put down.

32:16.782 --> 32:17.813
Why would I?

32:17.814 --> 32:21.766

what I'm here to find out.

32:38.494 --> 32:42.102
Yeah. I don't care, George,
you don't scare me.

32:45.238 --> 32:46.318
Fair enough.

32:48.383 --> 32:50.809
All right. What it is... she
comes to me, your girl.

32:50.876 --> 32:53.829
Different name. She's got
these uncut diamonds.

worth a lot of money,

you've got the right connections,

We agree a 70/30 split.

33:02.846 --> 33:06.789
She doesn't like it, but she
needs the money sharpish.

33:06.790 --> 33:08.769

33:24.477 --> 33:25.781
Right.

a contact in the trade,

33:29.798 --> 33:31.781
she's supposed to meet
him in Antwerp...

33:31.782 --> 33:35.063
Except she meets your boys
instead, and you rob her.

33:35.110 --> 33:35.825
Well, what can I say?

33:35.826 --> 33:39.321
It's a lot of money, and at the
end of the day, I'm a thief.

33:40.806 --> 33:43.797
But the thing is, she doesn't
like being ripped off,

33:43.798 --> 33:45.781
and she knows how to put up a fight.

33:45.782 --> 33:48.825

of the skull with a hat pin.

gets himself straight to hospital.

him in the nuts so hard,

Let's see who's been poking around
Dresller's private life, shall we?

45:00.369 --> 45:02.805
<i>That was last year, so we
thought, yeah, I know,</i>

45:02.806 --> 45:04.821
<i>we thought you could all
come to ours this year...</i>

45:05.345 --> 45:06.809
<i>I know, why not, right?</i>

45:07.611 --> 45:09.805
- Hello?
- Hello?

45:10.463 --> 45:12.753
Is this Alastair's mum?

45:13.294 --> 45:15.294
<i>Who is this?</i>

45:16.794 --> 45:20.635
I was with him... When he died.

45:20.770 --> 45:25.814
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- He was asking for you at the end.

45:26.818 --> 45:29.789
When he couldn't fight any more.

45:29.790 --> 45:30.635
(CRYING DOWN THE PHONE)

45:30.662 --> 45:33.986
"Mum. Mum."

45:36.291 --> 45:39.482
He was so scared of dying.

45:39.990 --> 45:41.930
<i>Why would you do this?!</i>

46:03.842 --> 46:04.850
(HE GROANS)

46:37.824 --> 46:38.852
What you got?

46:39.814 --> 46:43.424
Well, you were right. We found
spyware deep in Dresller's laptop.

46:44.603 --> 46:46.533
How closely was he being watched?

46:47.127 --> 46:49.385
Close enough to know
everything there is to know.

46:49.486 --> 46:51.837
It's not just passwords
and bank account log-ins.

46:52.369 --> 46:54.861
Whoever's been watching him knows
every sentence he's composed,

46:54.862 --> 46:56.845
every website he's visited.

46:57.174 --> 46:58.789
He knows his thoughts.

46:58.790 --> 47:01.510
It used to be that we could never
know the truth about each other.

47:02.181 --> 47:04.829
- Not really.
- Those days are gone.

47:05.665 --> 47:06.813
More's the pity.

47:07.102 --> 47:09.785
And how confident can
we be that the killer

47:10.012 --> 47:13.016
and the fellow who loaded the
spyware is the same guy?

47:14.243 --> 47:16.805
Well, we can't, to be fair,
er, we can't be certain...

47:16.806 --> 47:19.813
it could be anyone who had
access to that laptop.

47:19.814 --> 47:20.937
You say "anyone".

47:20.962 --> 47:25.079
But, I mean, well, how many people
can that be, realistically?

47:25.337 --> 47:26.809
I mean, someone like Dresller,

47:26.810 --> 47:30.825
a man with that kind of fantasy
life, those kind of secrets.

47:30.826 --> 47:33.777
How many people are you going
to let near your computer?

47:33.802 --> 47:36.087
How many people do any of
us let near our computer?

47:36.923 --> 47:38.833
So if he was watching
Dresller that closely,

47:38.834 --> 47:42.774
what are the chances he
was watching all of them?

47:43.842 --> 47:45.854
(TV ON)

48:04.790 --> 48:05.857
In order to plant the spyware,

48:05.858 --> 48:08.829
our subject had to have
direct physical access

48:08.830 --> 48:12.769
to everyone's computer, so,
we pulled credit card records

48:12.770 --> 48:14.813
from all the victims
and cross referenced.

48:14.814 --> 48:17.977
Now, over the past two-three
years, each of them

48:18.079 --> 48:21.821
made at least one payment to a
company called Geek Patrol.

48:21.822 --> 48:24.849
They come round your house, fix your
computer, set up your wifi network.

48:24.850 --> 48:26.102
Whatever...

48:26.958 --> 48:29.946
And all their computers
were fixed by one man.

48:31.192 --> 48:33.524
A Steven Rose.

48:35.524 --> 48:38.235
- That's him.
- Have we got an address?

48:53.806 --> 48:55.738
(SIRENS APPROACH)

49:07.204 --> 49:08.711
What are we waiting for?

49:09.790 --> 49:10.822
Bomb squad.

49:41.453 --> 49:43.906
All right, you've got your
perimeter, the area's cleared,

49:44.039 --> 49:45.829
we need to get in there, guv.

49:45.830 --> 49:48.769
He's not going to booby trap
his own place. Come on!

49:48.770 --> 49:49.841
And you're sure of that, are you?

49:49.842 --> 49:51.437
Yeah. I am.

49:51.679 --> 49:54.565
Easy for you to say, John.
You weren't here

49:54.566 --> 49:57.972
when I had to watch them scrape
Theo Bloom off the wall.

50:03.140 --> 50:05.829
Guv, Steven Rose could be on
his way to his next victim,

50:05.830 --> 50:08.821
and we won't know who that
is unless we are in there!

50:08.822 --> 50:10.967
The answer is "no".

50:10.992 --> 50:13.846
If you want to discuss it further,
we can do it back at the factory.

50:17.961 --> 50:19.825
I think I hear someone in there.

50:19.826 --> 50:22.781
In fact, I can! I can hear
someone screaming for help.

50:22.898 --> 50:24.336
DCI Luther...

50:24.578 --> 50:26.793
Exigent circumstances, sir!

50:26.997 --> 50:28.977
DCI Luther!

50:37.814 --> 50:39.822
(DISTORTED MUSIC PLAYS)

51:01.919 --> 51:03.883
Benny!

51:04.826 --> 51:06.109
Benny!

51:06.978 --> 51:08.994
Benny! Ben, come on!

51:13.770 --> 51:15.304
Come in.

51:16.147 --> 51:19.984
Benny, can you, er, stop this?
Whatever? Turn it off?

51:20.015 --> 51:22.224
- Whatever.
- I'll give it a go.

52:26.523 --> 52:30.907
- Are you ok? Boss?
- Yeah, it's all right.

54:23.782 --> 54:24.786
(CLATTERING)

55:04.859 --> 55:05.916
Steven!

55:07.424 --> 55:09.380
You've gotta stop!

55:34.858 --> 55:38.343
<i>- Is it US law?'</i>
- No, this one's according to English law.

55:38.445 --> 55:39.420
<i>When can I see it?</i>

55:39.445 --> 55:42.320
I'm sending it over right now. Why
don't we talk tomorrow morning?

55:42.345 --> 55:43.842
- 9.30 your time?
<i>- Ok.</i>

Sorry, guv. She's asked
for you by name.

57:01.351 --> 57:04.922
- Can I help?
- Are you DCI Luther?

57:07.274 --> 57:08.290
Yeah.

57:09.283 --> 57:11.223
I have a message for you.
