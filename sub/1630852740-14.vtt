My name's Maxine, better known
as "Tittie Skiddles,"

01:26.347 --> 01:31.221
and I am about a good 1,000 ccs
away from being

01:31.265 --> 01:34.050
the most awesome trans woman
that I can be.

01:34.094 --> 01:36.400
"Tittie Skiddles"
is an inside trans joke.

01:36.444 --> 01:38.750
Estrogen sometimes comes
in pill form,

01:38.794 --> 01:42.145
and some folks are fond of
calling them "Tittie Skiddles"

01:42.189 --> 01:46.758
because they're like little
candies that give you titties.

01:46.802 --> 01:50.240
I definitely turn heads,
but I love attention.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.590
And so if people wanna
stop and stare, awesome.

01:52.634 --> 01:55.767
I'm getting a return
on my investment.

01:57.204 --> 02:00.772
I was assigned male at birth,

02:00.816 --> 02:06.169
so I had this upbringing
of a more masculine persuasion.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.607
On my 17th birthday,
my mother decided for me

02:09.651 --> 02:10.739
that I was going to join
the Air Force,

02:10.782 --> 02:14.177
and I did 11 years
in the Air Force,

02:14.221 --> 02:17.441
and near the very end,
I had started to explore

02:17.485 --> 02:20.357
my gender identity,
and I started cross dressing.

02:20.401 --> 02:22.359
After that, I had arrived
at my decision.

02:22.403 --> 02:24.622
I think I'm transgender.
I think I'm a woman,

02:24.666 --> 02:27.712
and I started
my transition journey.

02:27.756 --> 02:31.151
And so the very first thing I
thought to do and I wanted to do

02:31.194 --> 02:33.414
is like, I'm getting boobs.

02:33.457 --> 02:34.632
It was funny going
into the surgeon's office.

02:34.676 --> 02:36.025
"Okay, how big
are you thinking?"

02:36.068 --> 02:37.896

I don't want a boob job.
I want a boob career.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.556
But after
the most recent boob job,

02:45.600 --> 02:48.472
after making it to 3,000 ccs,

02:48.516 --> 02:51.127
I had noticed these scars
around the incision area

02:51.171 --> 02:52.302
that are so dramatic.

02:52.346 --> 02:54.652
My goal is to take care
of the scarring,

02:54.696 --> 02:58.221
and while we're at it,
go that extra mile

02:58.265 --> 03:01.703
and go that extra 1,000 ccs
if possible.

03:01.746 --> 03:05.489
I feel like I'm so close
to my perfect goal

03:05.533 --> 03:07.970

and I go, this is Maxine.

03:08.013 --> 03:12.235

But I've been playing, you know,
my whole life

03:53.363 --> 03:54.843

the Roxy, the Whiskey,

03:57.889 --> 03:59.456
hanging out, rubbing elbows

03:59.500 --> 04:03.286

Motley Crue to Ratt.

04:03.330 --> 04:05.288

a singer-songwriter-musician,

04:12.077 --> 04:15.907
So I had plastic surgery done
for circles I had under my eyes.

04:15.951 --> 04:19.171
But since that day,
my life has changed forever.

04:19.215 --> 04:22.436
I stopped going out. I certainly
wasn't playing live anymore,

04:22.479 --> 04:24.351
doing any shows,
nothing like that.

04:24.394 --> 04:25.395

04:25.439 --> 04:26.918

04:28.268 --> 04:29.443

04:29.486 --> 04:30.879
Yeah, or think about
anything else.

04:30.922 --> 04:32.272

04:32.315 --> 04:33.882

play live onstage,

04:33.925 --> 04:36.188

04:36.232 --> 04:38.234
he can revitalize
his music career.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.279

04:39.322 --> 04:40.280

plastic surgery.

04:40.323 --> 04:43.108
No, definitely not.

Look at that inflammation.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.426
Look at that scar tissue.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.733
- That is terrible.
- Look at how effed Dave is.

04:58.776 --> 05:01.126
I'm sure that this is
gonna lead him

05:01.170 --> 05:03.477

05:17.099 --> 05:19.057

05:19.101 --> 05:21.451

05:21.495 --> 05:24.019

05:24.062 --> 05:25.586

05:25.629 --> 05:26.848
I was about to say, I know you--
I've gotta take these off.

05:26.891 --> 05:27.892
- I just--I know, I know.
- Yeah, we gotta take

05:27.936 --> 05:29.938

What do you do?

05:29.981 --> 05:31.461

- You're a musician.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.594
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
singer-songwriter.

05:33.637 --> 05:34.769
- Nice.
- You look like someone

05:34.812 --> 05:36.205
who would've been friends
with my brother.

05:36.248 --> 05:38.686
Kevin, lead singer
from Quiet Riot.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.992
Aren't you a little shocked
how much I look like him?

05:41.036 --> 05:42.124
Yeah.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.647
My brother Kevin was
the lead singer

05:43.691 --> 05:46.084
of the heavy metal band
Quiet Riot in the early '80s.

05:46.128 --> 05:48.086
They had hits like
"Cum On Feel the Noize"

05:48.130 --> 05:49.653
and "Bang Your Head."

05:49.697 --> 05:51.829
In fact, they were
the first metal rock group

05:51.873 --> 05:55.006
to have a number one album
on the Billboard charts.

05:55.050 --> 05:58.793
Clearly, massive talent
runs in the family.

05:58.836 --> 06:00.795
I actually have a...kind of
a funny story about...

06:00.838 --> 06:02.623
- Tell me.
- ...about your brother.

06:02.666 --> 06:05.147
Um, okay, so this is, like,
1980-something, right?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.367
- Right. Right.
- And, um, we end up, like,

06:07.410 --> 06:08.585
Hancock Park, which is--
- Hancock Park.

06:08.629 --> 06:10.718
I lived in the guest house
in the back.

06:10.761 --> 06:12.197
You could've been there
at the time. Who knows?

06:12.241 --> 06:15.462
No one says a word
to me except for Kevin.

06:15.505 --> 06:18.421
- Really?
- Who comes over and, you know,

06:18.465 --> 06:19.770
says hi, okay,
introduces himself.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.119
Say, "Hey, can I get you
a drink?"

06:21.163 --> 06:23.165
And, well,
I had way too much to drink.

06:23.208 --> 06:27.299
I throw up all over Kevin's nice
bar that we're talking about.

06:27.343 --> 06:28.649
- You're kidding me.
- Oh, Jesus.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.172
- No, okay.
- Jesus.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.608
- I remember that.
- Right.

06:31.652 --> 06:33.088
You were the guy who threw up
on my brother's bar?

06:35.177 --> 06:37.222
So I really appreciate David
for taking me back

06:37.266 --> 06:39.877
and reminding me of the days
when I was a med student,

06:39.921 --> 06:42.053
living above
my brother's pool house.

06:42.097 --> 06:45.448
I took care of his cat.
I cleaned out the cat box,

06:45.492 --> 06:47.450
and basically...

06:47.494 --> 06:50.105
I was my brother's little bitch,
wasn't I?

06:50.148 --> 06:51.541
So what happened you even went
to go have eye surgery?

06:51.585 --> 06:52.673
Even why'd I do it
in the first place? Right.

06:52.716 --> 06:54.326
- Yeah.
- My wife at the time

06:54.370 --> 06:56.285
was getting some work done.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.547
You know, watching her,
I'm like,

06:57.591 --> 06:58.722
you know, what if I was
gonna get something?

06:58.766 --> 07:00.420
What would, you know,
and she's like,

07:00.463 --> 07:02.030
"Well, you know, the only thing
on you that's a giveaway at all,

07:02.073 --> 07:03.466
you know, age-wise, is your--
the eyes, like, under here.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.642
It was like some puffiness,
like, just, you know,

07:05.686 --> 07:07.731
that--that you get, like,
the kind of fat underneath.

07:07.775 --> 07:10.168
So 2015-ish,
I went in for the original one,

07:10.212 --> 07:11.909
the under-eye surgery.
Where do I go?

07:11.953 --> 07:13.737
I went to the same person
that did hers

07:13.781 --> 07:15.739
with good results at the time.

07:15.783 --> 07:18.350
- So you had a blepharoplasty.
- Exactly.

07:18.394 --> 07:21.658
I personally don't even remove
lower eyelid skin,

07:21.702 --> 07:23.573
because I'm afraid
of the lower eyelid area.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.793
- Wow.
- Lower blepharoplasty is

07:25.836 --> 07:29.361
the removal of lower eyelid bags
or removal of skin.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.189
This is an area that
you have to be very careful

07:31.233 --> 07:33.714
because it's the thinnest skin
on the entire body.

07:33.757 --> 07:36.673
I don't like removing
any skin from the lower eyelid

07:36.717 --> 07:39.894
because it can result
in disfiguration,

07:39.937 --> 07:42.592
and to fix this
is extremely difficult.

07:42.636 --> 07:43.767
Well, the left one
came out okay,

07:43.811 --> 07:45.421
and the right one did not.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.770
So a couple months after that,

07:46.814 --> 07:48.816
went in to repair,
you know, stitch it somehow

07:48.859 --> 07:51.296
and pull the eye up,
and that didn't work.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.081
Six to nine months after that,
did another one,

07:53.124 --> 07:55.344
and at that point,
did a skin graft.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.868
You know, it took,
but it just made this worse.

07:57.912 --> 08:02.046
So same doctor. It took
three surgeries to repair this.

08:02.090 --> 08:03.657
I didn't have any of
the scarring that's under here.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.397
That's all from her attempting
to repair.

08:05.441 --> 08:08.879
That's about when you got
the point where I was like,

08:08.923 --> 08:10.141
"That's it. You know, you're not
touching me anymore."

08:10.185 --> 08:12.622
And so you don't have
any visual problems?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.755
- I don't. I don't.
- God, you are lucky.

08:14.798 --> 08:16.452
- Yeah.
- Seeing your dad

08:16.496 --> 08:18.019
have this eye thing...
- Not easy.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.108
He's like an outgoing person.
He's funny, as you can see.

08:20.151 --> 08:21.849
- You know?
- Totally. He's an entertainer.

08:21.892 --> 08:24.808
Yeah, but since the surgery,
it's--he's a little less that.

08:24.852 --> 08:26.636
Is this affecting
your whole music thing?

08:26.680 --> 08:28.159
I haven't been onstage.
I haven't--

08:28.203 --> 08:31.423
Since this happened, it's
affected every aspect of life.

08:31.467 --> 08:34.035
If I could get it basically
normal, I'd be thrilled.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.604
So you wanna go from where
you are now pretty much

08:37.647 --> 08:39.170
to match the left eye.

08:39.214 --> 08:42.173
As much as possible, yeah. Yeah.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.827
I mean, that's a big ask, obviously.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.003
- No, of course.
- Boy.

08:48.136 --> 08:50.878
You should not have had
an incision

08:50.921 --> 08:52.923
on the outside of your eye.
- Right.

08:52.967 --> 08:53.968
Period. I mean, you've got
a whole centimeter

08:54.011 --> 08:55.622
of lower eyelid retraction.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.146
We can make things
worse with surgery.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.888
I went to Mexico
for a simple breast lift

09:00.931 --> 09:03.760
but got a Mommy Makeover that
almost cost me everything.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.936
They told me they were gonna do
a debridement,

09:05.980 --> 09:08.156
but I didn't know I was gonna be
getting cut hip to hip.

09:08.199 --> 09:09.810
God.

09:11.159 --> 09:13.596
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:22.692
Here, sit up for me like that.
All right. Look up for me.

09:22.736 --> 09:25.260
Well, there's your skin graft
right there.

09:25.303 --> 09:27.523
- Where did they take the skin?
- Behind the ear.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.569
Do me a favor.
Turn your head that way.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.658
So this is going in the eyeball
sticking out,

09:31.701 --> 09:34.530
and that actually is
an incredible setup

09:34.574 --> 09:37.794
for, you know, lower lid
ectropion just like this.

09:37.838 --> 09:40.754
Lower eyelid ectropion is when
the lower eyelid

09:40.797 --> 09:42.625
pulls down from the eye,

09:42.669 --> 09:44.148
and that can be
from scar tissue,

09:44.192 --> 09:46.455
or removal of too much skin.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.892
In looking at David,
that's what's causing

09:48.936 --> 09:53.244
this significant and horrible,
disfiguring deformity.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.377
I have a very good friend.
His name is Guy Massry,

09:55.420 --> 09:56.944
who's an oculoplastic surgeon.

09:56.987 --> 09:59.686
I'm gonna have to recruit
Dr. Massry to help with us.

09:59.729 --> 10:01.078
I mean, you got
a whole centimeter

10:01.122 --> 10:02.689
of lower eyelid retraction.

10:02.732 --> 10:05.430
So that means you need to do
something to fill in that gap

10:05.474 --> 10:08.303
and help lift that up through
some type of a mid face lift.

10:08.346 --> 10:09.913
- Right.
- In addition,

10:09.957 --> 10:12.437
we need some type of a flap,
which means moving

10:12.481 --> 10:15.571
some local tissue around
to give it support.

10:15.615 --> 10:19.444
Let's say we go in there
and we get 30%, 20%,

10:19.488 --> 10:21.185
10% direction...
- Right.

10:21.229 --> 10:22.926
...without even a guarantee,

10:22.970 --> 10:26.277
knowing that we can make
things worse with surgery,

10:26.321 --> 10:27.801
what is your thoughts?

10:27.844 --> 10:30.151
I can't leave it as it is,
so I pretty much have to...

10:30.194 --> 10:32.980
- You have no choice.
- I have to try, yeah.

10:33.023 --> 10:34.634
Listen, we wanna get you
back there,

10:34.677 --> 10:37.071
get back some gig.
- Right.

10:37.114 --> 10:38.725
- And we're gonna go.
- There you go.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.162
And we're gonna watch you and
have fun without your glasses.

10:41.205 --> 10:42.946
- That would be--
- That is our goal.

10:42.990 --> 10:44.339
- That'd be awesome.
- Exactly.

10:44.382 --> 10:45.688
You know, when this is all
said and done,

10:45.732 --> 10:48.691
and I'm back to somewhat
kind of done with it all,

10:48.735 --> 10:51.259
and I could play a show
somewhere in town

10:51.302 --> 10:54.001
and have, uh, Dr. Nassif
and Dr. Dubrow come down,

10:54.044 --> 10:56.133
I would love that. I'm gonna
hold those guys to that.

10:56.177 --> 10:57.265
You're scared of that.

10:57.308 --> 10:58.875
I'm more scared than you maybe.

10:58.919 --> 11:01.008
But here we are. I have to deal
with what's in front of me,

11:01.051 --> 11:03.010
and this what's in front
of me now.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.712
- Hey, babe, I'm home.
- Hey, babe.

11:09.756 --> 11:12.628
- Did you get my maxi pads?
- Sure did.

11:12.672 --> 11:16.371
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

11:16.414 --> 11:19.156
My name is Tatyana.
I'm 21 years old,

11:19.200 --> 11:21.593
and I went to Mexico
for a simple breast lift

11:21.637 --> 11:24.553
but got a Mommy Makeover
that almost cost me everything.

11:24.596 --> 11:28.470
Right now, my body looks like
a disaster.

11:28.513 --> 11:29.950
I have wide areolas,
thick scars under my breasts,

11:29.993 --> 11:33.649
and my stomach has a huge scar
from hip to hip.

11:33.693 --> 11:36.304
I put a maxi pad there
to relieve pressure

11:36.347 --> 11:39.568
from my scars
'cause my scar is very thick,

11:39.611 --> 11:43.354
and it's in an awkward place,
so my clothes

11:43.398 --> 11:45.356
tend to push onto it,
and it can be very painful.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.445
I have to dress
a certain way now

11:47.489 --> 11:49.796
and make sure that my shirts
are always baggy.

11:49.839 --> 11:53.321
My insecurities are way
worse now.

11:53.364 --> 11:56.063
It's just been a lot.

11:56.106 --> 11:59.066
Yeah, and my kids, you know,

11:59.109 --> 12:02.678
my son, he points it out,
and I know he doesn't mean harm,

12:02.722 --> 12:09.163
but... I just wanna look
and feel normal again.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.909
So check this out.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.781
Was that really necessary?

12:18.825 --> 12:20.827
- I got dizzy.
- From one spin, you got dizzy?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.872
Hold on, hold on.
Let me do it real quick.

12:22.916 --> 12:24.395
So you wanna do it again
and test your spin?

12:24.439 --> 12:26.006
Really? You know, it's funny--

12:26.049 --> 12:28.008
I can go on roller coasters,
but I can't go in a circle.

12:28.051 --> 12:30.010
I can't--I can't spin either.
I can go super fast.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.186
- Yeah.
- Like, my car...

12:32.229 --> 12:34.275
- Oh, yeah, your Tesla.
- It's so fast.

12:34.318 --> 12:37.147
By the way, I pull up
to a Lamborghini,

12:37.191 --> 12:40.890
and these two young guys are
there, and I go, "Like this?"

12:40.934 --> 12:43.893
And the guy looks at me like...
And I go, "Like that?"

12:43.937 --> 12:46.374
Put it in Ludicrous Mode,
and I go whaa!

12:46.417 --> 12:47.636
And all of a sudden,
he's going, eee!

12:47.679 --> 12:49.725
And I'm going eeee-ahh!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.075
And I just look at him
and go, ahh! You know?

12:52.119 --> 12:54.034
It was awesome!

12:54.077 --> 12:56.384
Bring it, bitch.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.389
Check...this out.

13:01.432 --> 13:03.434
- Whoa!
- Is that crazy or what?

13:03.478 --> 13:04.914
How did that happen?

13:04.958 --> 13:07.308
This is a tummy tuck
and a breast surgery

13:07.351 --> 13:10.006
gone very, very wrong.

13:10.050 --> 13:11.573
Can you please send in Tatyana?

13:11.616 --> 13:14.750
- Tatyana.
- Hello.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.491
Nice to meet you, Tatyana.
Dr. Nassif.

13:16.534 --> 13:18.623
Hi. Terry Dubrow, Tatyana.
Nice to meet you.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.756
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Alex, How are you?

13:20.800 --> 13:22.236
- Dr. Nassif. Dr. Dubrow.
- I'm Terry Dubrow.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.020
Please have a seat. Okay.

13:24.064 --> 13:27.284
What's one thing you notice
about Tatyana and her husband?

13:27.328 --> 13:29.765
- Very, very--
- Husband? Very young.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.723
- Very young. How old are you?
- 21.

13:31.767 --> 13:33.073
- 21.
- When did this happen?

13:33.116 --> 13:34.683
Now how many years ago

13:34.726 --> 13:36.250
did you have this surgery
we're talking about?

13:36.293 --> 13:37.860
- Last year.
- Last year. Okay.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.428
That's a lot of surgery
for a 20-year-old to have.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.082
- Yeah.
- Tell us about that.

13:42.125 --> 13:45.868
So when I was about 15,
I ended up having my son.

13:45.912 --> 13:47.914
- Okay.
- So my breasts, you know,

13:47.957 --> 13:49.916
I breastfed,
so they got bigger,

13:49.959 --> 13:52.092
they got saggy, and then
I had my daughter at 17,

13:52.135 --> 13:54.355
and same thing happened,
and then I realized, you know,

13:54.398 --> 13:56.923
I just want a lift
and an areola reduction,

13:56.966 --> 13:59.229
so I was like, well,
let me venture out to Mexico.

13:59.273 --> 14:01.144
- What did the doctor say?
- So he was like,

14:01.188 --> 14:03.581
"Well, you can't just get a lift
because your breasts

14:03.625 --> 14:05.540
are gonna look ugly."
- Why?

14:05.583 --> 14:07.934
"You need--You need an implant
for the fullness."

14:07.977 --> 14:10.980
- Okay, what else did he say?
- "You need a tummy tuck, too."

14:11.024 --> 14:12.808
And I was like, really?

14:12.852 --> 14:15.942
- And also I can do lipo.
- You're kidding me.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.900
How much was the charge
for all of those things?

14:17.944 --> 14:18.858
$6,000.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.250
- For all of it?
- Everything?

14:20.294 --> 14:22.078
Yeah. He got me good.

14:22.122 --> 14:23.732
Wow.

14:23.775 --> 14:27.954
Okay, this is basically a WTF
or "what the [bleep]?" moment.

14:27.997 --> 14:30.695
And I'll tell you why. To take
an impressionable 20-year-old

14:30.739 --> 14:33.133
who comes in
for one type of procedure,

14:33.176 --> 14:35.918
and then try to add on
additional procedures,

14:35.962 --> 14:37.354
is unbelievably not cool.

14:37.398 --> 14:41.663
In fact, the only way
to describe it is predatory.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.796
So immediately after surgery,
I kinda saw, like,

14:44.840 --> 14:46.189
a little bubble
on my belly button.

14:46.233 --> 14:49.149
And then my tummy tuck incision
started doing it.

14:49.192 --> 14:53.196
It was just, like, yellow and
puffy and smelled like death.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.415
Yeah.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.372
Well, that's what it is.
It's tissue death.

14:55.416 --> 14:56.504
I started feeling very weak.

14:56.547 --> 14:58.854
I was going to school
at the time.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.073
I skipped class
to go to the hospital,

15:00.116 --> 15:01.770
and they admitted me.

15:01.813 --> 15:03.032
They told me,
"Your doctor didn't

15:03.076 --> 15:05.165
clean his utensils right,
so all your body

15:05.208 --> 15:06.949
is getting infected now.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.603
You're gonna need
surgery today."

15:08.646 --> 15:10.518
So you were septic.
We call that septic, where the--

15:10.561 --> 15:12.302
Bacteria in your blood.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.870
Bacteria in your blood,
where the infection has seeded

15:14.914 --> 15:17.003
into your general
cardiovascular system.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.875
- Did she seem really sick?
- Uh, yes.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.268
- She seemed out of it.
- Totally out of it.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.965
- Yeah.
- That's sepsis.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.967
They told me they were gonna do
a debridement,

15:25.011 --> 15:26.926
but I didn't know, like...
- What that meant.

15:26.969 --> 15:29.058
Yeah, I didn't know I was gonna
be getting cut hip to hip.

15:29.102 --> 15:30.973
So they opened you up
and discovered

15:31.017 --> 15:31.974
it was very extensive underneath.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.541
Yeah, very.

15:33.584 --> 15:36.457
If I would've waited a day
longer, I would've been dead.

15:36.500 --> 15:39.199
I basically told my family
my goodbyes,

15:39.242 --> 15:42.158
and I thought it was gonna be
my last time seeing my husband.

15:42.202 --> 15:43.986
All right, so you've got

15:44.030 --> 15:45.596
an emergency situation
right there.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.034
I had four surgeries
within two months.

15:48.077 --> 15:50.471
I had a chunk of my stomach
cut out.

15:50.514 --> 15:52.777
- We saw that.
- God. Darn it.

15:52.821 --> 15:55.476
I also had the implants
I never wanted removed.

15:55.519 --> 15:56.825
It was just so scary
at the moment.

15:56.868 --> 15:57.957
I didn't know how to handle it.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.915
This abdominal situation
can't be easy.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.570
No, it's not.
It's not easy at all,

16:02.613 --> 16:04.528
especially
with my two little ones.

16:04.572 --> 16:07.009
You know, they're at the stage
where they like to play horsey.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.445
- Mm-hmm.
- And it's like I can't even

16:08.489 --> 16:10.578
get 'em on my back because
it just hurts my scars.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.232
- God.
- So...

16:12.275 --> 16:13.537
what would you like to happen?

16:13.581 --> 16:16.671
My main thing is just
fixing up the scars.

16:16.714 --> 16:19.587
Also my areolas--
they never got reduced.

16:19.630 --> 16:20.892
Tatyana's been through some

16:20.936 --> 16:23.765
really tough
surgical complications,

16:23.808 --> 16:27.812
and although she seems very calm
and cool about it,

16:27.856 --> 16:31.947
my experience has told me
that just below the surface

16:31.991 --> 16:34.950
is a very scared,
emotional person

16:34.994 --> 16:36.952
who feels
very potentially insecure,

16:36.996 --> 16:38.606
and that really
makes me wanna help her

16:38.649 --> 16:40.782
as much as I possibly can.

16:40.825 --> 16:42.175
Let's go to the exam room
to figure out

16:42.218 --> 16:44.133
what the tissue's like
and what your options are.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.356
I play over 50 instruments.

16:49.399 --> 16:54.013
♪ I...need bigger boobs

16:55.666 --> 16:57.842
There's a lot
of scar tissue there.

16:57.886 --> 16:59.496
We're gonna break through it.
I wanna stay deep.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.063
And I'm releasing
the mid face deep.

17:01.107 --> 17:05.154
If we don't, the chance
of excess is less.

17:06.547 --> 17:08.984
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

17:09.028 --> 17:10.942
First is the breast situation.

17:10.986 --> 17:13.032
You do have a dilated areola.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.555
And let's look at your scars.

17:14.598 --> 17:17.384
So you have, you know,
kind of thick vertical scars,

17:17.427 --> 17:19.560
but you don't have
any horizontal scars.

17:19.603 --> 17:24.173
In terms of your abdomen,
tummy tuck scar is really wide.

17:24.217 --> 17:28.569
And then you have this little
bit of an overhang here.

17:28.612 --> 17:31.615
That's an interesting
belly button situation.

17:31.659 --> 17:35.141
You do seem to have a little bit
of fluid in here.

17:35.184 --> 17:38.274
Whoa. There's something kinda
weird going on here.

17:38.318 --> 17:41.190
What I'd like to do is punch
a little, teeny, little hole

17:41.234 --> 17:43.453
and see if there's any fluid
beneath there.

17:43.497 --> 17:46.848
Tatyana's belly button doesn't
look really healthy.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.764
In fact, it looks like
just below the surface,

17:49.807 --> 17:53.768
there may be some trapped fluid
that could indicate

17:53.811 --> 17:56.814
there is either
an abscess cavity, foreign body,

17:56.858 --> 17:59.208
or generalized chronic
wound healing problem.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.993
No, there's no opening,
but it's a big crevice

18:02.037 --> 18:04.822
that goes all the way in here.

18:04.866 --> 18:06.302
Doesn't seem to be infected,

18:06.346 --> 18:09.131
but it's definitely
going somewhere.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.654
The question is,
what's inside there?

18:10.698 --> 18:13.396
We really won't know
till we're in surgery.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.920
Have a seat.
Let's talk about your options.

18:15.964 --> 18:18.358
You could theoretically have
your areolas reduced

18:18.401 --> 18:20.534
and that vertical scar removed.

18:20.577 --> 18:24.451
That would have a lower risk
than if you did

18:24.494 --> 18:28.150
a more formal mastopexy, which
is a breast lift operation,

18:28.194 --> 18:30.848
where you had
the areolas removed,

18:30.892 --> 18:32.285
you had this scar removed,

18:32.328 --> 18:33.677
and then you had them
slightly taken apart

18:33.721 --> 18:35.766
to give you some shaping
to move the breast tissue

18:35.810 --> 18:37.899
that you do have,
which is substantial,

18:37.942 --> 18:39.509
up into this area.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.337
Which one of those
sounds better to you?

18:41.381 --> 18:43.818
- Lifting it up.
- You wanna do that?

18:43.861 --> 18:45.863
Now, whether or not I can
make you a belly button

18:45.907 --> 18:48.170
really depends on what's
at the bottom of that hole.

18:48.214 --> 18:52.957
Then you're gonna need a full
regular revisional tummy tuck,

18:53.001 --> 18:57.571
which means remove the scar,
elevate up that loose skin,

18:57.614 --> 19:01.749
tighten the muscle,
try to find a belly button,

19:01.792 --> 19:05.535
pull the excess skin down
and remove it.

19:05.579 --> 19:09.278
The problem with that
is that elevates the risk.

19:09.322 --> 19:11.889
So tummy tucks are among
the riskiest procedures

19:11.933 --> 19:13.152
in plastic surgery,

19:13.195 --> 19:16.024
mainly because
so much skin is elevated,

19:16.067 --> 19:16.894
so much blood supply
is disrupted.

19:16.938 --> 19:19.506
Is that what you wanna do?

19:19.549 --> 19:21.203
I'm feeling a little scared.

19:21.247 --> 19:23.205
Sometimes it's difficult
to hide the emotions.

19:23.249 --> 19:24.511
Most times I do well,

19:24.554 --> 19:26.382
but sometimes
it just gets to me.

19:26.426 --> 19:28.776
My support system is what
keeps me going.

19:28.819 --> 19:31.561
And I'm looking forward
to being able to spend time

19:31.605 --> 19:33.650
with my kids the way I want to.

19:33.694 --> 19:37.088
It is scary, but, um,
I don't know.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.395
I feel like I'm ready for it.

19:39.439 --> 19:42.224
If I'm gonna go through
with this, I wanna go all in.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.573
- Let's do this thing.
- Let's do it.

19:43.617 --> 19:44.879
- Let's do it!
- Huh?

19:44.922 --> 19:46.228
- Great pleasure.
- Thank you. Great to see you.

19:46.272 --> 19:48.491
Thank you.
I'm ready to take the risk.

19:48.535 --> 19:50.841
You're a risk taker. You got it.

20:04.551 --> 20:07.728
I play over 50 instruments.

20:07.771 --> 20:09.643
I say over 50
because I've lost count

20:09.686 --> 20:13.777
'cause I keep adding them,
kinda like ccs in my boobs.

20:17.564 --> 20:22.221
♪ I need...bigger boobs

20:22.264 --> 20:26.660
♪ Yes, I do

20:28.270 --> 20:30.925
♪ The boobie greed is real,
the boobie greed is real ♪

20:30.968 --> 20:33.101
♪ The boobie greed,
the boobie greed ♪

20:33.144 --> 20:34.972
♪ The boobie greed is real

20:36.670 --> 20:40.500
I play guitar, violin,
flutes galore.

20:40.543 --> 20:44.112
Anything that has strings,
I probably own it

20:44.155 --> 20:46.157
and know how to play it.

20:46.201 --> 20:48.203
Choose your poison.

20:49.552 --> 20:51.467
- The rabab?
- Yes.

20:51.511 --> 20:54.514
I was about 16 years old
when I met Melissa.

20:54.557 --> 20:57.473
Melissa has
a congenital muscular dystrophy.

20:57.517 --> 21:00.476
She was born with weak muscles,

21:00.520 --> 21:03.000
and around roughly
30 years of age,

21:03.044 --> 21:04.915
I moved in with her,

21:04.959 --> 21:09.137
and we started our beautiful
domestic relationship.

21:09.180 --> 21:12.880
During this time, I would be
encouraged to be myself.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.839
Melissa is just, like,
"Just be you,

21:15.883 --> 21:18.712
and you wanna be feminine.
This is fine.

21:18.755 --> 21:22.063
You wanna try wearing dresses
and skirts, you know?"

21:22.106 --> 21:27.677
Then I was like, yes.
Yes, yes, yes. All of this yes.

21:29.070 --> 21:31.464
How would you feel if I went
for the full Monty

21:31.507 --> 21:34.728
and went for all 4,000 ccs?

21:34.771 --> 21:38.993
And not just that, I'm sure
you noticed, too, the scarring.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.866
Yeah.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.222
I love you.

21:51.266 --> 21:53.834
We definitely break
the mold, I guess.

21:53.877 --> 21:56.402
But would we have it
any other way?

21:56.445 --> 21:59.056
You know?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.063
Mr. David, how you doing?

22:06.107 --> 22:08.544
A little nervous, you know,
mixed with excitement,

22:08.588 --> 22:11.765
but--but some nerves, but, um,
I'm ready.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.898
D. Massry and I have worked
hand-in-hand together

22:14.942 --> 22:18.641
with these complex orbital cases
for over 20 years.

22:18.685 --> 22:22.341
And he is absolutely fantastic
when it comes to fixing

22:22.384 --> 22:24.952
lower eyelid retraction
and entropion.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.519
So this is something
I need to explain to you.

22:26.562 --> 22:28.738
No matter how great
of a job we do...

22:28.782 --> 22:30.436
- Mm-hmm.
- ...it could fail.

22:30.479 --> 22:31.741
- We're gonna do our best.
- Okay.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.090
- All right, David.
- All right.

22:33.134 --> 22:34.396
- Okay.
- See you later on.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.796
<i>For David's surgery,</i> <i>
we will make an incision</i>

22:42.839 --> 22:44.580
<i>below the lower eyelid</i> <i>
and through the canthus</i>

22:44.624 --> 22:47.322
<i>to release all the scar tissue,</i> <i>
then we will recruit</i>

22:47.366 --> 22:49.411
<i>deep tissue from</i> <i>
David's lower cheek area</i>

22:49.455 --> 22:53.197
<i>and perform a mid face lift to
fill in a portion of the defect.</i>

22:53.241 --> 22:54.895
<i>Next we will reposition</i> <i>
the angle of the eyelid</i>

22:54.938 --> 22:57.419
<i>and recreate the corner</i> <i>
of the eye.</i>

22:57.463 --> 23:00.335
<i>Then we will determine whether</i> <i>
we need an upper eyelid flap</i>

23:00.379 --> 23:03.991
<i>and/or a skin graft to fill in</i> <i>
the remaining deficit.</i>

23:04.034 --> 23:06.994
Okay, so we're making
the incision now.

23:07.037 --> 23:08.822
So now this is access
to the cheek.

23:08.865 --> 23:10.214
- Yeah.
- So as I go down here,

23:10.258 --> 23:11.433
we're gonna break through it.
I wanna stay deep.

23:11.477 --> 23:15.785
And we're releasing
the mid face deep.

23:15.829 --> 23:19.093
He's so short on skin that we
have to recruit skin from below

23:19.136 --> 23:22.444
and then find out how much
of a deficit he has left.

23:22.488 --> 23:23.793
And hopefully I can just
swing some skin

23:23.837 --> 23:26.317
from the upper/lower lid.
That's called a flap.

23:26.361 --> 23:29.538
We don't, the we have to graft,
and a chance of excess is less.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.148
So we'll take a look at the size
of the defect

23:31.192 --> 23:32.628
to make a decision.

23:32.672 --> 23:34.021
So this is what you'd call
a mid face lift?

23:34.064 --> 23:36.676
Yes. And if you look
at the middle face,

23:36.719 --> 23:39.853
it comes up, and if you look
at the two sides,

23:39.896 --> 23:42.638
look at the cheek on this side
and the cheek on the other side.

23:42.682 --> 23:45.336
So we've recruited skin
to his lower lid.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.599
We got the mid face set.

23:46.642 --> 23:47.774
Now all we have to do

23:47.817 --> 23:49.906
is recreate the angle
of the eyelid,

23:49.950 --> 23:52.082
also put back the canthus together,

23:52.126 --> 23:54.476
and then see how much
of the defect is left.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.043
I actually like
the mid position.

23:56.086 --> 23:56.957
- Don't you guys?
- Yeah.

23:57.000 --> 23:57.914
Yeah, looks good.

23:57.958 --> 23:59.438
Now what's left is you actually

23:59.481 --> 24:01.962
fill the deficit of skin
that is lost

24:02.005 --> 24:03.920
by taking a piece of skin
from the upper eyelid,

24:03.964 --> 24:07.489
called the flap, and moving it
into the lower eyelid deficit.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.056
This will match up beautifully.

24:09.099 --> 24:11.014
Well, the good news is

24:11.058 --> 24:14.104
he will not need a skin graft
from his neck.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.716
This flag flap of tissue
from the upper eyelid,

24:16.759 --> 24:18.587
moving it down to lower eyelid,

24:18.631 --> 24:22.417
seems like the best way to go
to fill in that void.

24:22.461 --> 24:25.115
I just hope it survives.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.595
Looks absolutely fantastic.

24:26.639 --> 24:30.381
I mean, that eyelid,
if it heals even close to that,

24:30.425 --> 24:32.514
this will be a great result.

24:32.558 --> 24:35.299
Boy, it'd be nice to find
some memory

24:35.343 --> 24:37.563
of the belly button in here,
something I can use.

24:37.606 --> 24:42.219
There's just like a-a mass.
Damn it.

24:42.263 --> 24:44.874
Hello, hello, hello.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.397
My name's Maxine.

24:46.441 --> 24:47.921
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow--

24:47.964 --> 24:50.184
their expressions
are just priceless.

24:54.275 --> 24:56.059
<i>♪ I wanna be perfect</i>

25:00.847 --> 25:02.413
- You ready for this?
- Yes.

25:02.457 --> 25:04.807
All right, let's fix you up,
'cause you, uh,

25:04.851 --> 25:07.767
you know, you were a little
bit...almost victimized.

25:07.810 --> 25:09.725
Tatyana's case is
really high risk,

25:09.769 --> 25:11.814
really challenging,

25:11.858 --> 25:15.252
mainly because she had so much
tissue injury and tissue loss

25:15.296 --> 25:18.778
and infection that there isn't
very good blood supply.

25:18.821 --> 25:22.259
There's a ton of scar.
But Tatyana--she's a young girl.

25:22.303 --> 25:24.784
So let's see whether
we can fix all that.

25:30.572 --> 25:31.660
<i>
For Tatyana's surgery,</i>

25:31.704 --> 25:33.270
<i>I'll start by downsizing</i> <i>
her areolas</i>

25:33.314 --> 25:35.969
<i>and perform a scar revision</i> <i>
by cutting out</i>

25:36.012 --> 25:37.231
<i>the previous scar</i> <i>
on her breast.</i>

25:37.274 --> 25:39.015
<i>Then I will manipulate</i> <i>
her breast issue</i>

25:39.059 --> 25:39.929
<i>and perform a breast lift.</i>

25:39.973 --> 25:42.584
<i>Next I'll move on to her stomach</i>

25:42.628 --> 25:45.587
<i>by making an incision</i> <i>
across her lower abdomen,</i>

25:45.631 --> 25:46.849
<i>elevating up the abdominal wall</i>

25:46.893 --> 25:48.285
<i>to see if I can find</i> <i>
her belly button.</i>

25:48.329 --> 25:51.071
<i>Next, I'll tighten</i> <i>
her abdominal muscles,</i>

25:51.114 --> 25:53.247
<i>remove her scar</i> <i>
and excess skin</i>

25:53.290 --> 25:55.075
<i>and hopefully pull</i> <i>
her belly button through</i>

25:55.118 --> 25:56.946
<i>before closing her up.</i>

25:56.990 --> 25:58.774
So obviously,
there are two goals here.

25:58.818 --> 26:02.343
One is to remove the scar
and the dilated areola

26:02.386 --> 26:04.954
and two--
give her a breast shave.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.130
I think we're gonna have
enough loose skin

26:07.174 --> 26:10.003
to be able to remove
all her scar

26:10.046 --> 26:12.483
and downsize her areola.

26:12.527 --> 26:17.488
Okay. So this is the areola
and all of the scar.

26:17.532 --> 26:21.710
Bye-bye.
Now we have to get a shape.

26:21.754 --> 26:23.407
This is the origami part.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.933
Tatyana needs what I call
an origami of her breast

26:26.976 --> 26:30.937
to try to create a shape
that gives me a good projection

26:30.980 --> 26:33.026
to width proportion.

26:33.069 --> 26:37.291
Okay, this is not horrible.
Let's go after the abdomen.

26:37.334 --> 26:39.641
This is going to be tough
because I've got

26:39.685 --> 26:42.339
no belly button,
very contracted scar,

26:42.383 --> 26:45.342
and a very reduced
overall blood supply.

26:45.386 --> 26:47.214
It would be nice to find
some memory

26:47.257 --> 26:50.652
of the belly button in here,
something I can use.

26:50.696 --> 26:54.134
So far just scar.
There's nothing good.

26:54.177 --> 26:58.529
It's just like a mass. Damn it.

26:58.573 --> 27:02.882
And so, yeah, there's nothin'.
So I'm kinda screwed.

27:02.925 --> 27:06.276
Okay, well, then I'm gonna make
her a belly button, damn it.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.757
Nature gave you one,
a surgeon took it away,

27:08.801 --> 27:11.368
and this surgeon's gonna
make you a new one.

27:11.412 --> 27:13.240
Looking belly button-ish.

27:13.283 --> 27:16.722
That's me fishing for you
to say, "Ooh, looks good."

27:16.765 --> 27:17.984
It looks good.

27:18.027 --> 27:19.681
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

27:19.725 --> 27:22.989
That was...yeah. Uh...
Okay, I'm happy with that.

27:23.032 --> 27:25.121
That's a real belly button.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.167
All right, now let's cut off
the excess skin.

27:28.734 --> 27:31.084
All right, so that's
the last bit of all that scar.

27:31.127 --> 27:32.738
Got the abdomen.

27:32.781 --> 27:34.740
I think this is awesome.
Let's close it up.

27:34.783 --> 27:37.656
Let's go home.
Closing music, please.

27:44.837 --> 27:45.751
What have you got going on?

27:45.794 --> 27:47.187
We have a patient named Maxine.

27:47.230 --> 27:50.843
Maxine is here for her breasts.

27:50.886 --> 27:52.279
Hello!

27:52.322 --> 27:54.977
She obviously has
very large breast implants

27:55.021 --> 27:59.373
and visible scars that she
doesn't like under her areolas.

27:59.416 --> 28:01.157
So why don't we bring in Maxine

28:01.201 --> 28:03.899
and see if we can give her
some good advice?

28:03.943 --> 28:06.728
Can you please send in Maxine?

28:06.772 --> 28:10.297
Hello, hello, hello.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.038
My name is Maxine.

28:12.081 --> 28:14.214
What a lovely place
you have here.

28:14.257 --> 28:16.869
Lovely, lovely, lovely.
I love everything.

28:16.912 --> 28:20.220
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:20.263 --> 28:21.482
How are you?

28:21.525 --> 28:23.484
Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow--

28:23.527 --> 28:26.443
their expressions
are just priceless.

28:26.487 --> 28:29.272
Brought my ukulele

28:29.316 --> 28:30.883
- Oud?
- ...from one of my deployments.

28:30.926 --> 28:32.275
You know, I'm Lebanese,

28:32.319 --> 28:35.322
and so the Lebanese, uh,
musicians play the oud.

28:35.365 --> 28:36.453
- Love it.
- Oud.

28:36.497 --> 28:37.933
- Oud!
- Do you play it?

28:37.977 --> 28:39.500
- I do, a little bit, yeah.
- Oh, I must hear it.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.893
Well, then after you sit down,
you got to, please.

<i>I</i> have some dance moves

29:04.177 --> 29:06.832
So anyway, as you decided
to transition,

29:06.875 --> 29:10.400
what was sort of the first step
in the process?

29:10.444 --> 29:11.793
It's funny, 'cause I was like,

29:11.837 --> 29:14.187
I'm going to schedule
a boob job.

29:14.230 --> 29:15.449
First thing.

29:15.492 --> 29:16.580
That was the first thing
I decided to do.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.234
And what did they put in first?

29:18.278 --> 29:20.149
- 1,050 ccs.
- First time?

29:20.193 --> 29:22.543
- Yes.
- An 800-cc saline filled

29:22.586 --> 29:24.719
to 1,050 ccs.
- That's correct.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.634
But you already were
on hormones.

29:26.677 --> 29:31.117
Nope. 1,050 ccs in 2016.
I started hormones in 2017.

29:31.160 --> 29:32.422
By then I had gotten

29:32.466 --> 29:34.555
all of my name
and gender changes squared away.

29:34.598 --> 29:36.383
- Okay.
- Everything concerning that.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.645
I love being asked,
"Well, what's your goal?

29:37.688 --> 29:39.603
What's your ideal size?"
And I'm like,

29:39.647 --> 29:41.736
ah, in the neighborhood
of 4,000 ccs.

29:41.780 --> 29:46.828
In 2018, I got an upgrade
to 2,200 ccs.

29:46.872 --> 29:51.833
From there,
this last January of 2021,

29:51.877 --> 29:54.227

to 3,000.

Whoa.

29:55.794 --> 30:00.799
This last surgery left me
with some really nasty scarring,

30:00.842 --> 30:02.888
and scars that feel like
it's kinda taking away

30:02.931 --> 30:04.498
from the whole experience.

is the belly button there?

Will it create a little skin
over it,

31:30.497 --> 31:34.240
are right along

32:02.094 --> 32:04.835

32:04.879 --> 32:07.099

- Yeah, yeah.

32:13.235 --> 32:16.412
Okay, and you can swim
in the ocean?

32:16.456 --> 32:18.153

like, uh...

32:18.197 --> 32:21.069
- Buoys.
- ...buoys, aren't they?

32:21.113 --> 32:22.810

if they go up more...

32:22.853 --> 32:26.161
- That'd be okay?
- I would be elated.

32:26.205 --> 32:31.079
Going from 3,000 to 4,000 ccs
the way Maxine is considering

32:31.123 --> 32:36.432
is basically adding
an entire liter bottle of soda

32:36.476 --> 32:39.000
to each of your breasts.

32:39.044 --> 32:42.961
And you know what?
Soda's not very good for you.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.527
Let's talk practical terms.

32:44.571 --> 32:49.097
Let's say you put 16
60-cc syringes,

32:49.141 --> 32:52.492
and it starts expanding it 33%.

32:52.535 --> 32:57.105
It not only expands
the entire circumference

32:57.149 --> 33:00.108
and dimensions of your breast,

33:00.152 --> 33:03.938
but it also expands the opening
of the incision 33%.

33:03.982 --> 33:08.856
So it makes it 33% harder
to get it closed.

33:08.899 --> 33:11.119
You'd have to put
full-thickness stitches in

33:11.163 --> 33:14.079
outside of the skin, inside,
and outside the other side,

33:14.122 --> 33:19.214
and tie big knots
to try to get this to close.

33:19.258 --> 33:21.608
What kind of scar do you think
that would make?

33:21.651 --> 33:24.698
- Uh, pretty significant.
- Very significant.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.354
I don't think it's worth it.

33:28.397 --> 33:31.879
I, uh, appreciate
all the caution.

33:31.922 --> 33:35.491
But there's also the little
voice in my mind that says

33:35.535 --> 33:41.193
if I had just let myself
be discouraged,

33:41.236 --> 33:44.152
I wouldn't even be Maxine.
I wouldn't be Tittie Skiddles.

33:44.196 --> 33:45.762
I wouldn't be here today.

33:45.806 --> 33:47.373
This is not my first rodeo.

33:47.416 --> 33:50.289
This is not the first time
I have been given the risks

33:50.332 --> 33:53.161
of what I am potentially doing
to my body,

33:53.205 --> 33:56.425
and sometimes the results
are worth the risks.

33:56.469 --> 33:58.123
It was a great pleasure
meeting you.

33:58.166 --> 33:59.341
- Good luck.
- Likewise.

any problems.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.518

- You're welcome.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.350
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hey.

34:08.394 --> 34:09.960
How does your eye feel
right now?

34:10.004 --> 34:11.440
It feels fine.
I mean, obviously,

34:11.484 --> 34:12.833
I have a little, you know,
I can tell that, you know,

34:12.876 --> 34:14.226
it was stitched and all that,
but nothing, like,

34:14.269 --> 34:15.705
as far as the vision itself,
the eye or anything.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.359
- It feels fine.
- Okay.

34:17.403 --> 34:18.882
- Sit up a little bit for me.
- Yeah.

34:18.926 --> 34:20.493
I just wanna feel...

34:20.536 --> 34:22.625
When checking David's eye today,
it's really important for me

34:22.669 --> 34:25.541
to check to see if he has any
irritation or change in vision,

34:25.585 --> 34:29.154
because it's too early right now
to check on his flap,

34:29.197 --> 34:30.807
so I wanna keep that bandage on
for a few more days,

34:30.851 --> 34:32.244
then we'll look at it

34:32.287 --> 34:34.855
and see how the flap is doing
and check the color.

34:34.898 --> 34:37.988
So let's talk about the surgery.
So we did a flap...

34:38.032 --> 34:39.555
- Mm-hmm.
- ...from the upper eyelid skin.

34:39.599 --> 34:42.776
- Okay.
- Okay? Lifted off that flap,

34:42.819 --> 34:45.126
upper eyelid, still attached
to your blood supply.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.910
- Right.
- And then go...wheep!

34:46.954 --> 34:47.911
- No way.
- And put it right in there.

34:47.955 --> 34:49.174
- Really?
- Get out of here. Wow.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.002
- A lid shearing procedure.
- Amazing.

34:52.046 --> 34:53.917
And by the time
we were finished,

34:53.961 --> 34:56.659
the lower eyelid
looked beautiful.

34:56.703 --> 34:57.573
- Wow.
- Okay?

34:57.617 --> 34:58.879
So happy.

34:58.922 --> 35:02.187
So now the next few weeks
is gonna be critical

35:02.230 --> 35:04.102
to make sure no problem
with infection, bleeding...

35:04.145 --> 35:05.407
- Of course.
- ...things like that,

35:05.451 --> 35:07.714
make sure there's no breakdown.
- Okay.

35:07.757 --> 35:09.846
And I hope to God you can get
back to that playing...

35:09.890 --> 35:11.239
- Absolutely.
- ...live again.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.545
And of course,
you gotta let us know,

35:12.588 --> 35:13.981
especially, you know--
- No, are you kidding?

35:14.024 --> 35:15.069
- I'd love you guys--you guys--
- Especially since...

35:15.113 --> 35:16.462
You guys have to.

35:16.505 --> 35:18.594
I'm going to do everything
in my power to make sure

35:18.638 --> 35:22.207
I heal well, everything,
medications taking, icing it.

35:22.250 --> 35:24.122
I'll do everything I can
to get back onstage again

35:24.165 --> 35:25.732
after all this time.

35:25.775 --> 35:28.604
We often tell patients don't
work out for six weeks at all.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.084
- Right.
- Don't put your head down.

35:30.128 --> 35:33.174
In your case, I'd say,
don't throw up on any bars...

35:33.218 --> 35:35.045
- Yeah.
- ...for at least three months.

35:35.089 --> 35:36.743
Oh, Dr. Dubrow...

35:36.786 --> 35:39.354
Why did I share that story?

35:39.398 --> 35:40.355
Why did I share?

35:40.399 --> 35:42.314
- Whaa!
- Thank you so much.

35:42.357 --> 35:43.706
So I'm never gonna live down
this, like, throw-up thing.

35:43.750 --> 35:45.099
- Oh.
- I feel like, I feel like,

35:45.143 --> 35:47.014
from, like, you know,
30-plus, you know,

35:47.057 --> 35:49.016
years ago, you know what I mean?

35:56.241 --> 35:58.808
Hello, folks. How are you doing?

35:58.852 --> 36:00.941
- I'm doing okay.
- Better now.

36:00.984 --> 36:03.248
So my job was to remove
the scar,

36:03.291 --> 36:05.554
take everything apart
in what I call origami,

36:05.598 --> 36:10.516
fold it in to try to give you
some projection that at least

36:10.559 --> 36:13.388
is in proportion to the width
and in good shape.

36:13.432 --> 36:16.043
I did that, and see, on the
table, it looked pretty good.

36:16.086 --> 36:17.610
Then the really hard part

36:17.653 --> 36:19.307
was the belly button
and the tummy tuck.

36:19.351 --> 36:21.266
So let's look at how things
are healing,

36:21.309 --> 36:25.444
and hopefully there's
a belly button situation,

36:25.487 --> 36:27.663
something left from what I made.
Okay?

36:27.707 --> 36:29.099
Okay.

36:29.143 --> 36:32.538
What I'm looking for today
with Tatyana is

36:32.581 --> 36:35.497
generally how she's doing,
how her wounds are healing,

36:35.541 --> 36:38.587
and what's going on
with that belly button?

36:38.631 --> 36:40.937
And so whether it's alive
or not will determine

36:40.981 --> 36:44.463
whether she's gonna end up
with a viable belly button

36:44.506 --> 36:47.205
and determine whether or not

36:47.248 --> 36:49.119
I have to do
any revisional surgery on her.

36:49.163 --> 36:50.773
I think you've got
good upper fullness.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.514
Your scars are all gone.

36:52.558 --> 36:53.341
I think this is gonna be
pretty good. Don't you?

36:53.385 --> 36:54.908
Yeah. It looks great.

36:54.951 --> 36:56.388
I thought they were implants
at first.

36:56.431 --> 36:57.954
You thought they were implants.

36:57.998 --> 36:59.478
By the way, that's the best
compliment you can give me.

36:59.521 --> 37:02.089
Thought they were implants.

37:02.132 --> 37:04.091
I freaking love that.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.614
I think my breasts look amazing.

37:05.658 --> 37:07.573
I'm very happy
that they're my natural tissue

37:07.616 --> 37:09.183
and not implants.

37:09.227 --> 37:12.665
I'm just amazed that he was able
to make 'em look this good.

37:12.708 --> 37:15.711
Okay, so when you first
look at this,

37:15.755 --> 37:17.974
it sort of looks like kind of
a successful tummy tuck,

37:18.018 --> 37:19.411
doesn't it?
- Yep.

37:19.454 --> 37:21.239
It actually looks like
a perfect incision, too.

37:21.282 --> 37:22.849
- Yeah. So...
- Yeah.

37:22.892 --> 37:24.546
That looks damn good, brother.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.593
Okay, so, so far so good
on the incision.

37:27.636 --> 37:30.204
We know the overall contour
is good.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.293
The question is,
is the belly button there?

37:34.426 --> 37:35.601
It's a little soupy.

37:35.644 --> 37:37.820
Okay.

37:37.864 --> 37:39.474
Here's the question.

37:39.518 --> 37:44.087
Will it do what nature does--
create a little skin over it,

37:44.131 --> 37:47.439
or will it just scar down
and go away?

37:47.482 --> 37:48.744
We'll have to wait
and see what happens.

37:48.788 --> 37:52.095

37:52.139 --> 37:54.184
It's the belly button, okay?

37:54.228 --> 37:56.926
So come on, belly button, behave.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.974
It feels good to finally
feel normal again.

38:01.017 --> 38:02.323
I love my body now,

38:02.367 --> 38:04.934
and I can finally say goodbye
to the maxi pads.

38:04.978 --> 38:06.414

38:06.458 --> 38:08.068
It's been at least five years

38:08.111 --> 38:10.853

being onstage because my eye,

38:13.334 --> 38:15.597

Becoming a mom
at such a young age

38:30.264 --> 38:31.700
was the best decision
I've ever made.

38:31.744 --> 38:34.050
But going to Mexico
for a simple breast lift

38:34.094 --> 38:35.791
and getting talked into getting
a Mommy Makeover

38:35.835 --> 38:37.315
was devastating.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.186
I just wanted the body

38:57.683 --> 38:59.554
My belly button now is healed,

38:59.598 --> 39:01.339
and although it doesn't look
like the average belly button,

39:01.382 --> 39:03.079
it's my belly button,

- Thank you.

39:05.647 --> 39:06.822
You're welcome.

39:06.866 --> 39:08.433
Before my surgery,

39:08.476 --> 39:10.739
my Mommy Makeover
was more of a Mommy Massacre.

39:10.783 --> 39:12.306
My breasts were left saggy
with wide areolas

39:12.350 --> 39:15.962
and thick scars, and I was
missing my belly button.

39:16.005 --> 39:19.139
I was so insecure about my body,
and I had to use a maxi pad

39:19.182 --> 39:21.576
so I could relieve pressure
off of my stomach.

39:21.620 --> 39:24.971
But now thanks to Dr. Dubrow,
my breasts are perky.

39:25.014 --> 39:27.365
My scars are minimized,
and I have a smooth tummy

39:27.408 --> 39:29.454
with an actual belly button.

39:29.497 --> 39:30.803
I love my body now,

39:30.846 --> 39:32.848
and I can finally say goodbye
to the maxi pads.

39:32.892 --> 39:34.981

39:35.024 --> 39:36.112
I'm just happy I don't have to
walk in the store no more

39:36.156 --> 39:38.898
and go to the aisle for my wife.

39:38.941 --> 39:42.597

I'm, like, 80.

the three failed attempts
to fix that surgery,

40:12.497 --> 40:15.717
I have been on like a limbo,
like, just hold in my life.

40:18.241 --> 40:19.678

41:12.600 --> 41:14.254

41:14.297 --> 41:16.778
Dr. Nassif arranged for me
to get my under eye tattooed

41:16.822 --> 41:18.127
to get that discoloration fixed.

41:18.171 --> 41:21.566
Amazing procedure
so any actual scars are gone.

41:21.609 --> 41:22.741
- Right.
- Yeah.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.438
I can definitely see
a difference

41:24.482 --> 41:25.700
since it's been done.

41:25.744 --> 41:27.136
It looked great beforehand,
without a doubt,

41:27.180 --> 41:29.095
it was amazing
and a huge difference,

41:29.138 --> 41:31.663
but I think the tattoo fixed
the color underneath it

41:31.706 --> 41:34.361
which was like the last piece
that it needed.

41:34.404 --> 41:36.102
I have to tell you,
no matter how--

41:36.145 --> 41:39.018
whether you're close or far,
it looks fantastic.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.106
I mean, it's incredible.

41:40.149 --> 41:42.325
Like, being able
to watch him here,

41:42.369 --> 41:44.458
being able to, like, see him
onstage again, he's back.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.547
So what's weirder, being up
there for the first time

41:46.591 --> 41:47.766
in a long time?
- Yeah.

41:47.809 --> 41:49.898

41:49.942 --> 41:51.509
Grandpa in the club.
Are you kidding me?

41:51.552 --> 41:54.294
Before my surgery, my right eye
was disfigured and droopy,

41:54.337 --> 41:55.948
and I felt like
I looked like a monster.

41:55.991 --> 41:57.602
I hid from the world
behind sunglasses,

41:57.645 --> 42:01.388
and it affected my music career.
But now thanks to Dr. Nassif,

42:01.431 --> 42:03.477
my right eye is lifted
and finally looks normal.

42:03.521 --> 42:08.090
It feels so good to finally
throw the sunglasses out.

42:08.134 --> 42:11.137

It just feels great.
