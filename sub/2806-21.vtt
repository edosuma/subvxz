WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:07.423
Do you realize we're
getting married in four weeks?

00:07.590 --> 00:10.676
Four weeks, baby. Four weeks!

00:11.261 --> 00:13.595
You realize you get louder each week?

00:14.556 --> 00:18.142
There's still so much to do!
Have you written your vows?

00:18.309 --> 00:22.896
I figured I'd just buy those.
"Pat, I'd like to buy a vow." Ha, ha.

00:23.565 --> 00:27.026
You know I've no sense of humor
when it comes to this.

00:28.486 --> 00:33.323
- Right. Have you written yours yet?
- No, but I know what I'm gonna say.

00:34.325 --> 00:36.702
Do you happen to know
what I'm gonna say?

00:39.247 --> 00:41.665
Let's do it now. It won't be hard.

00:41.833 --> 00:43.876
Say what's in your heart.

00:50.550 --> 00:54.303
Look at her go.
She must love me more than I love her!

00:54.929 --> 00:59.099
What's wrong with me?
Ooh, don't open that door.

01:40.141 --> 01:45.312
Phew. "Monica, there are no words..."

01:47.774 --> 01:51.276
There are no words!
This shouldn't be this hard!

01:51.861 --> 01:56.365
Uh... Oh! You've done this before.
What did you say in your vows?

01:56.533 --> 02:00.869
With Carol I promised never
to love another woman until I die.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.996
She made no such promise.

02:03.748 --> 02:08.460
I'm pathetic. Monica knows what
to say, you should have seen her.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.965
What's the emergency?

02:13.216 --> 02:17.177
You have to help me write my vows.
All I have is this.

02:17.345 --> 02:21.306
I like the pretty drawing
of you in the wedding dress.

02:22.058 --> 02:26.353
- Thank you.
- Except your breasts look small.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.523
Those are my eyes!

02:31.234 --> 02:35.070
- Those are my breasts.
- Oh, yeah.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.658
Why don't you start
with something simple?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.118
Like, um:

02:41.286 --> 02:46.540
"Monica, from the moment I met you
I knew I loved you."

02:46.708 --> 02:48.500
I can't do that.

02:48.668 --> 02:51.211
Everyone, this is Chandler.

02:51.379 --> 02:53.505
Hi, I'm Ross' little sister.

02:54.090 --> 02:56.133
Okay.

02:58.094 --> 03:01.513
Okay, okay.
Um, maybe you could start with:

03:01.681 --> 03:04.391
"Chandler, even though
we were friends...

03:04.642 --> 03:08.145
...there was a part of me
that knew I wanted more."

03:08.313 --> 03:13.108
All right, there's a nuclear
holocaust. I'm the last man on Earth.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.651
Would you go out with me?

03:20.283 --> 03:22.868
Ooh! Are we allowed
to lie in the vows?

03:24.245 --> 03:28.749
Okay, don't talk about those feelings.
Just say something about...

03:28.917 --> 03:31.877
...all the things
he's taught you, like...

03:37.926 --> 03:40.344
Or all the things you taught him.

03:41.262 --> 03:45.265
Everybody knows the erogenous zones.
One, two, three...

03:45.808 --> 03:50.687
...four, five, six and seven.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.689
There are seven?

03:55.360 --> 03:58.946
- That's one?
- Heh, heh. Kind of an important one.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.032
I was looking at it upside down.

04:03.910 --> 04:07.496
Ha. You know, sometimes that helps.

04:12.043 --> 04:15.254
Okay, start out with a little one...

04:15.505 --> 04:18.298
...a two, a one-two-three...

04:19.341 --> 04:22.719
...a three, a five...

04:23.846 --> 04:26.431
...a four, a three-two...

04:26.599 --> 04:28.809
...two, a two-four-six.

04:29.727 --> 04:33.480
Two-four-six, four, two...

04:33.648 --> 04:36.316
...two, four-seven...

04:37.193 --> 04:40.028
...five-seven, six-seven...

04:40.238 --> 04:42.781
...seven, seven...

04:43.032 --> 04:46.326
...seven, seven, seven...

04:46.494 --> 04:47.953
...seven!

04:48.955 --> 04:49.997
Seven.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.755
Oh! I got it.
How about something like:

04:58.923 --> 05:03.885
"Monica, when I look back
over our time together..."

05:08.599 --> 05:10.517
- Yeah?
- I can't do all of it.

05:10.768 --> 05:12.477
Look back over your time together.

05:16.149 --> 05:17.524
Oh, look, twins!

05:17.692 --> 05:21.737
No fair! I don't even have one,
how come they get two?

05:21.904 --> 05:24.656
- You'll get one.
- Yeah, when?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.283
All right, I'll tell you what.

05:26.451 --> 05:28.869
When we're 40,
if neither of us are married...

05:29.746 --> 05:33.874
...what do you say we have one?
- Why wouldn't I be married?

05:35.043 --> 05:37.210
Oh, no, no, no.
I just meant hypothetically.

05:37.378 --> 05:40.464
Hypothetically,
why won't I be married?

05:40.631 --> 05:41.757
No, no.

05:41.966 --> 05:45.552
What is it? Is there
something unmarriable about me?

05:46.346 --> 05:48.889
- Uh... Uh...
- Well?

05:49.057 --> 05:52.392
Dear God, this parachute
is a knapsack!

05:54.854 --> 05:56.146
I'm getting married today!

05:59.650 --> 06:01.360
Think he knew I was here?

06:08.576 --> 06:09.993
Nice try.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.995
Wait, wait, wait.

06:14.957 --> 06:16.166
- Look, Monica...
- Ah!

06:20.630 --> 06:24.091
- This is not gonna work.
- I bet this'll work.

06:32.475 --> 06:35.143
You are so great! I love you.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.279
What?

06:46.447 --> 06:50.283
I said you're so great,
and then I stopped talking.

06:52.328 --> 06:55.580
- You said you love me!
- No, I didn't.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.835
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't!

07:00.920 --> 07:03.463
- You love me!
- No, I don't!

07:03.673 --> 07:05.424
Stop it! Stop it!

07:09.679 --> 07:13.723
You know, I was thinking,
what if I, uh, unpack here?

07:13.933 --> 07:15.684
Then all your stuff would be here.

07:17.979 --> 07:19.354
Well...

07:22.024 --> 07:23.733
What if it was here?

07:24.444 --> 07:27.487
Then you'd be going back
and forth all the time.

07:28.072 --> 07:29.573
Doesn't make any sense.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.658
Okay.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.164
What if we live together,
and you understand what I'm saying?

07:46.799 --> 07:48.717
We wanted to surprise you.

07:59.145 --> 08:00.687
Oh, my God!

08:07.195 --> 08:08.778
Chandler...

08:09.947 --> 08:11.907
...in all my life...

08:12.783 --> 08:15.452
...I never thought I'd be so lucky...

08:18.956 --> 08:22.584
...as to fall in love with my best...

08:24.086 --> 08:28.131
My best... There's a reason
why girls don't do this!

08:28.299 --> 08:30.425
Okay, okay, okay! I'll do it.

08:31.594 --> 08:33.385
I thought...

08:37.683 --> 08:39.183
I can do this.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.648
I thought...

08:44.857 --> 08:50.070
...that it mattered what I said
or where I said it.

08:50.696 --> 08:55.909
Then I realized the only thing
that matters is that you...

08:59.747 --> 09:04.251
You make me happier
than I ever thought I could be.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.548
And if you let me...

09:09.882 --> 09:14.052
...I'll spend the rest of my life
trying to make you feel the same way.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.604
Monica?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.066
Will you marry me?

09:30.278 --> 09:31.987
Yes.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.586
Can we come in?
We're dying out here!

09:48.754 --> 09:50.338
Come in! Come in!

09:51.966 --> 09:53.258
- We're engaged!
- Yes!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.189
- Hi.
- What have you guys been up to?

10:08.357 --> 10:11.735
Uh, helping Chandler write his vows.
He kicked us out.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.696
Joey kept making
inappropriate suggestions.

10:16.699 --> 10:20.577
How is "Monica, I love
your sweet ass" inappropriate?

10:22.455 --> 10:24.080
How's Monica doing?

10:24.248 --> 10:28.168
Lucky she's got a sweet ass.
She's not so good at writing.

10:29.587 --> 10:32.380
In four weeks
they're gonna be married!

10:32.590 --> 10:34.758
Let's just hope it works.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.177
Nine out of 10 marriages
end in divorce.

10:37.345 --> 10:39.596
Heh. That's not true.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.848
You're right. How's the missus?

10:43.726 --> 10:44.768
I can't believe...

10:44.935 --> 10:47.437
...they're together 3 years.
- That long?

10:47.605 --> 10:51.066
It seems like less
because they hid it from us.

10:52.443 --> 10:54.778
Hey, it's me. Coming in.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.953
I've had a very long, hard day.

11:04.622 --> 11:08.208
- Uh, I'm getting chicken. Want some?
- Uh, no. Bye, then.

11:13.047 --> 11:14.297
Are you okay?
I'm so sorry.

11:14.465 --> 11:17.676
He wouldn't leave.
He kept asking if I wanted chicken.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.219
Chicken?

11:20.388 --> 11:22.097
I could eat some chicken.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.016
Hey, Joe!

11:27.645 --> 11:31.147
Can I get a, uh, three-piece,
uh, coleslaw, beans and a Coke?

11:32.650 --> 11:33.983
Diet Coke.

11:38.197 --> 11:42.325
- Why didn't they tell us?
- I know, we were cool about it.

11:42.493 --> 11:45.453
You? And you?

11:46.372 --> 11:48.748
You cannot tell. No one knows.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.792
How? When?

11:50.960 --> 11:53.586
- It happened in London.
- In London?

11:56.507 --> 12:00.135
We didn't want to make
a big deal out of it.

12:00.302 --> 12:02.554
But it is a big deal!

12:03.013 --> 12:05.473
- I have to tell someone.
- No, no!

12:05.933 --> 12:07.976
- You can't.
- Please!

12:08.144 --> 12:12.564
We don't want to deal with telling
them. Just promise you won't tell.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.485
All right!

12:18.195 --> 12:20.196
I can't wait to be with you.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.490
I'll tell Rachel I'm doing laundry.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.702
Laundry, huh? Is that my new nickname?

12:27.913 --> 12:29.497
Aw.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.208
You know your nickname, Mr. Big...

12:34.628 --> 12:39.716
Oh, look, there's Monica and Chandler.
Hey! Hey, you guys! Hey!

12:50.311 --> 12:52.604
Chandler and Monica!

12:52.772 --> 12:54.272
Oh, my God!

12:54.523 --> 12:57.400
- Aah! Chandler and Monica!
- Oh, my God!

12:57.693 --> 13:01.279
- Oh, my eyes! My eyes!
- Phoebe! Phoebe!

13:01.530 --> 13:05.158
- It's okay! It's okay!
- No! They're doing it!

13:05.326 --> 13:06.576
I know! I know!

13:06.827 --> 13:08.077
- You know?
- Yes!

13:08.287 --> 13:11.456
And Joey, but Ross doesn't,
so stop screaming!

13:12.041 --> 13:13.082
Hey, what's going on?

13:16.128 --> 13:17.462
What? What?

13:17.713 --> 13:20.715
We're excited that you
might get this place!

13:21.258 --> 13:24.636
- Actually, it looks really good.
- It looks pretty good!

13:26.013 --> 13:27.430
Get in here! Come on!

13:31.393 --> 13:33.895
So they don't know
that Rachel knows?

13:35.105 --> 13:38.066
Yes, but it doesn't matter
who knows what.

13:38.234 --> 13:41.528
Enough of us know.
We can just tell them we know.

13:41.695 --> 13:44.697
The lying and the secrets
will be over.

13:44.865 --> 13:49.536
Or, we can not tell them we know
and have a little fun of our own.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.414
We better go if we're gonna
catch that movie.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.375
- Bye.
- Bye.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.253
Bye, Chandler. I miss you already.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.427
Did you see
the inappropriate pinching?

14:06.637 --> 14:07.762
Actually, I did.

14:07.972 --> 14:11.391
So now do you believe
that she's attracted to me?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.603
Oh, my God!
My God, she knows about us!

14:15.771 --> 14:19.232
- Phoebe knows about us!
- I didn't tell them.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.318
Them? Who's them?

14:22.486 --> 14:26.114
Uh, Phoebe and Joey.

14:27.950 --> 14:29.200
Joey!

14:29.577 --> 14:30.827
And Rachel.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.038
They made me promise not to tell.

14:34.206 --> 14:37.667
They think they are so slick,
messing with us!

14:37.918 --> 14:41.004
They don't know that we know
that they know.

14:42.381 --> 14:44.340
- So...
- Ah, yes!

14:44.592 --> 14:47.468
The messers become the messees!

14:48.554 --> 14:52.056
My God, he wants me to come
over and feel his biceps!

14:53.142 --> 14:54.309
- Are you kidding?
- No.

14:54.476 --> 14:57.061
I can't believe he'd do that to Mo...

15:05.988 --> 15:08.573
Joey? Do they know that we know?

15:09.158 --> 15:11.284
- No.
- Joey!

15:11.493 --> 15:14.162
- They know you know.
- Ugh! I knew it!

15:15.122 --> 15:17.248
I cannot believe those two!

15:17.458 --> 15:20.209
They thought that they could
mess with us? With us?

15:23.547 --> 15:27.008
They don't know that we know
they know we know.

15:28.344 --> 15:30.261
Joey, you can't say anything.

15:30.429 --> 15:32.388
Couldn't if I wanted to.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.100
This is totally getting out of hand.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.978
- She wants me to put lotion on her!
- She's bluffing!

15:39.188 --> 15:42.106
She's not backing down.
She went like this.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.403
He's not backing down.
He went to get lotion.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.283
Oh, man.
Aren't you guys done yet?

15:52.451 --> 15:57.080
The sooner Phoebe breaks Chandler
the sooner this is all over.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.207
- Ooh, I like that.
- Okay.

15:59.458 --> 16:04.295
Okay, show him your bra.
He's afraid of bras. Can't work them.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.222
Wow! You didn't rip off
any buttons.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.057
It's not my first time.

16:18.394 --> 16:20.937
You go seduce her until she cracks.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.981
Okay, give me a second.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.734
- Did you clean up in here?
- Of course.

16:32.616 --> 16:33.866
Oh, you're, uh, going?

16:34.076 --> 16:36.327
Um, not without you, lover.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.544
So, this is my bra.

16:48.215 --> 16:50.299
It's very, very nice.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.013
Well, come here.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.890
I'm happy we're gonna
have all the sex.

16:59.435 --> 17:02.895
You should be. Heh. I'm very bendy.

17:07.859 --> 17:11.069
- I'm gonna kiss you.
- Not if I kiss you first.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.260
There's nothing left
for us to do but kiss.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.013
Here it comes.

17:38.098 --> 17:39.599
Our first kiss.

17:48.692 --> 17:52.028
- Okay, okay, okay, fine, you win!
- Ha!

17:52.196 --> 17:54.030
- I can't have sex.
- Why not?

17:54.198 --> 17:56.991
- I'm in love with Monica.
- You're what?

17:59.578 --> 18:04.540
Love her! That's right, I love her!
I love her!

18:09.213 --> 18:11.005
I love you, Monica.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.133
I love you too, Chandler.

18:19.640 --> 18:22.433
I thought you guys were doing it,
I didn't know you were in love.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.647
That's it, it's over.
Everybody knows.

18:27.856 --> 18:31.901
- Well, Ross doesn't.
- We'd like it if no one told him yet.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.528
No.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.116
What are you doing?

18:38.826 --> 18:42.787
Get off my sister!

18:43.705 --> 18:47.333
Friends getting married,
it's gotta change things.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.210
Think it'll be different?

18:49.461 --> 18:52.505
How can it not be?
They're gonna have kids...

18:52.756 --> 18:56.092
...and hang out with other couples
who have kids.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.845
And maybe they'll leave the city...

18:59.054 --> 19:01.889
...to be near a Volvo dealership.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.352
Things change.

19:06.562 --> 19:09.814
I don't want them
to move to a Volvo dealership.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.442
It'll be okay, Joe. Heh.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.155
Sorry. I just...
I like things the way they are.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.866
Who's this little naked guy?

19:20.117 --> 19:22.160
Uh, that naked guy would be me.

19:22.327 --> 19:25.454
- Ha, aw, look at the little thing.
- Ha-ha-ha.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.123
Yes.

19:28.375 --> 19:32.712
Yes, fine, that is my penis.
Can we be grownups now?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.799
- Who are those people?
- Got me.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.093
Oh, that's Nana right there.

19:39.261 --> 19:41.929
- Wow.
- Let's see.

19:42.139 --> 19:44.807
"Me and the gang at Java Joe's."

19:45.017 --> 19:48.561
Wow. Monica, you look like
your grandma. How old was she?

19:49.104 --> 19:50.688
Let's see, 1939.

19:50.898 --> 19:52.982
Yeah, uh, 24, 25.

19:53.150 --> 19:56.110
Huh. Looks like a fun gang.

20:01.575 --> 20:04.785
Ooh! Look, look, look!
I got Monica naked.

20:04.953 --> 20:05.995
Let me see.

20:08.999 --> 20:10.917
No, that would be me again.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.506
Hey, you guys.

20:17.674 --> 20:18.716
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.969
- What's going on?
- Well, we were just talking about...

20:22.179 --> 20:25.431
...you guys getting married
and how great it is.

20:25.599 --> 20:29.685
Yeah, you can get a Volvo.
If that's what you really want.

20:30.938 --> 20:32.355
- That's so sweet.
- Hmm.

20:33.732 --> 20:37.485
- So, we both finished our vows.
- Can we read them?

20:37.694 --> 20:40.655
As long as I don't hear his
and he doesn't hear mine.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.573
- Okay.
- Okay.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.245
- Aw.
- Oh.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.416
Oh, that's beautiful.

20:53.835 --> 20:55.253
Funny one! Good!

20:57.464 --> 20:58.965
Will you marry me?

21:00.842 --> 21:03.719
- Ha-ha-ha.
- What? I don't get it.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.179
Oh, yeah!

21:08.433 --> 21:11.060
- Man, this is hilarious!
- Chandler!

21:12.312 --> 21:14.939
Don't worry, we'll make yours funnier.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.782
Okay, what do you think?

21:27.202 --> 21:31.789
- Dude...
- I have never known love like this.

21:32.541 --> 21:35.084
- You really like it?
- Dude!

21:36.503 --> 21:38.296
How did you write this?

21:38.463 --> 21:41.090
I stole Monica's
and changed the name. Shh.

21:43.552 --> 21:46.095
- You can't do that!
- If he goes first he can!
