01:03.897 --> 01:05.698
Will you tell me something?

01:14.607 --> 01:16.376
We are on the beach.

01:18.711 --> 01:20.480
Walking on the beach.

01:21.848 --> 01:25.752
And the clouds are rolling in so
fast, we can see them coming.

01:27.320 --> 01:30.889
The ocean is rolling
in the wind so fast,

01:30.890 --> 01:32.826
and the wind, we
can see it coming.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.496
And then the rain begins.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.634
Big drops, like acorns
hitting the sand.

01:43.670 --> 01:45.472
And it starts raining hard.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.577
But in the distance,

01:51.945 --> 01:53.613
we see buildings.

01:55.748 --> 01:57.316
When it's dark

01:57.317 --> 01:58.751
and when it's light,

01:59.619 --> 02:01.287
high walls...

02:02.155 --> 02:04.524
Very, very high walls.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.926
We walk around them

02:08.928 --> 02:10.430
looking for a door.

02:11.564 --> 02:12.898
And you find one.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.133
I find the door.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.635
And inside,

02:16.102 --> 02:17.770
it is warm,

02:18.638 --> 02:20.206
and bright,

02:21.040 --> 02:22.842
and there are others.

02:24.210 --> 02:25.745
Then what happens?

02:26.779 --> 02:29.883
They give us things
to eat and drink.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.687
And when we've eaten so
much we can't eat any more,

02:35.688 --> 02:37.223
we climb up.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.393
Up the stairs, into rooms.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.196
Each our own room,
each our own bed.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.364
Bed.

02:45.365 --> 02:48.334
There's clean blankets
and clean sheets.

02:48.868 --> 02:51.170
Sheets.

02:51.171 --> 02:54.440
And the rain pounds
against the windows,

02:55.508 --> 02:58.444
but the glass is
sealed and strong.

02:59.579 --> 03:02.448
Nothing comes through
but the sound.

03:03.917 --> 03:06.319
No wind, no cold...

03:07.921 --> 03:09.389
Just the sound.

03:14.093 --> 03:15.495
Where is it?

03:17.230 --> 03:18.765
We're on the way.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.701

Hey, hey! What you doing?

05:05.538 --> 05:07.806
I'm not gonna hunt it, I'm
gonna follow it to water.

05:07.807 --> 05:09.447
- We have to keep moving.
- No, stay here.

10:21.687 --> 10:22.955
It's all right.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.198
What is that?

10:33.532 --> 10:34.900
It's a bandage.

10:36.168 --> 10:37.336
Is anyone here?

10:39.038 --> 10:40.939
No.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.241
No, I've... I've
searched everywhere.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.310

Oh.

10:46.646 --> 10:47.980
It's safe.

10:48.948 --> 10:51.449
There's anything we
could ever want here.

10:51.450 --> 10:53.686
Food, water...

10:54.253 --> 10:55.354
Water.

14:54.093 --> 14:55.961
What if this is home?

14:57.630 --> 14:58.898
It's not.

15:06.372 --> 15:07.973
Where are people?

15:08.774 --> 15:10.276
There are beds.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.444
There is sheets.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.516
I have no memory of this place.

15:18.417 --> 15:22.520
This is the only thing
we have come across

15:22.521 --> 15:25.257
in years of walking.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.628
There is something wrong here.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.303
The longer we stay here, the
longer till we get there.

15:38.304 --> 15:39.804
We have water now.
We could pack it,

15:39.805 --> 15:41.673
get to the other side of the
forest into the Silver Ridge.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.108
I made it up.

15:45.044 --> 15:49.248
I told you I knew where we came from
and where we were going, but...

15:53.319 --> 15:55.186
it wasn't real.

15:55.187 --> 15:57.122
What are you talking about?

15:58.223 --> 16:01.059
It was easier to keep going

16:01.060 --> 16:03.262
if we had somewhere to go.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.700
That's all it ever was.

16:12.738 --> 16:14.340
What about the map?

16:17.209 --> 16:19.645
Do you really know where we are?

16:34.727 --> 16:36.261

and no matter how long I
looked, I never found it.

55:12.642 --> 55:18.714
I was very, very afraid of the spooky
tree outside my grandparents' window.

55:18.715 --> 55:21.050
They had a black
cat named Secret

55:21.051 --> 55:24.253
that would run into the basement
whenever there was a loud noise.

55:24.254 --> 55:25.522
Thunder, especially.

55:27.290 --> 55:28.558
When I was little,

55:29.426 --> 55:31.327
a boy asked me if we
could be married,

55:31.328 --> 55:32.862
and I said yes.

55:34.364 --> 55:36.833
Sometimes I think
we're still engaged.

55:52.782 --> 55:53.883
Yeah, okay, sure.

57:22.071 --> 57:23.907

57:24.441 --> 57:25.742
Something.

59:13.049 --> 59:15.919

blink one eye.

59:16.653 --> 59:18.154
If not, blink two.

59:24.193 --> 59:25.695

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.451

01:01:30.386 --> 01:01:32.155
Lonelier than me even.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.862
Yes, but you have me now.
You do.

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:43.366

01:01:48.337 --> 01:01:50.073
I promise, I'm not.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:52.842

Okay, good.

You never got to find out.

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:20.069
It's lonely being lonely.

01:02:21.604 --> 01:02:23.538
And it's hard not
to know things.

01:02:23.539 --> 01:02:26.976
But it's easier when you're with
someone who cares about you.

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:31.881
But when you're lonely and you're
lost, all at the same time...

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:36.185
Who was she?

01:02:37.487 --> 01:02:38.487
Oh.

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:40.021
Pretty?

01:02:41.390 --> 01:02:42.492
I bet.

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:49.898
And you have to know that
when certain things go,

01:02:49.899 --> 01:02:51.466
other things are going to come.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:53.202
But I'm not going to go.

We don't have to be lonely
anymore, you and I.

Even if things are confusing,

01:03:12.388 --> 01:03:14.023
at least we're not alone.

01:03:36.579 --> 01:03:38.247
Ah!

01:03:46.789 --> 01:03:48.590

barely visible through
the swirling dust,

01:04:21.824 --> 01:04:24.259
was a solitary figure.

01:04:24.260 --> 01:04:28.163
She waited and watched till
the figure approached.

01:04:28.164 --> 01:04:30.565

I brought you something to eat.

01:04:44.513 --> 01:04:45.514

forth like giants.

01:24:28.196 --> 01:24:31.932
And in the distance,
we hear a thunderclap.

01:24:31.933 --> 01:24:33.668
And then the rain begins.

01:24:34.669 --> 01:24:35.804
And we run.

01:24:37.472 --> 01:24:39.306
The rain is warm

01:24:39.307 --> 01:24:42.544
and the smell of the trees
is rich in our noses.

01:24:43.411 --> 01:24:44.411
And then,

01:24:44.979 --> 01:24:46.247
smoke.

01:24:48.016 --> 01:24:49.683
And in the distance,

01:24:49.684 --> 01:24:54.054
we see a little house
built of stone and wood.

01:24:54.055 --> 01:24:56.124
And you push open the door.

01:24:58.426 --> 01:24:59.594
And inside,

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.463
there are people.

01:25:01.963 --> 01:25:03.764
And it is warm

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:05.232
and bright.

01:25:05.233 --> 01:25:08.202
And they give us things
to eat and drink.

01:25:08.203 --> 01:25:09.803
And they give us a bed.

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:11.339
And sheets.

01:25:13.808 --> 01:25:15.943
It's where we came from.

01:25:15.944 --> 01:25:17.512
It's where we're going.

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.582
