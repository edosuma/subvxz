I don't know.

01:01.090 --> 01:03.050
In my vision, I just
knew she needed help.

01:03.140 --> 01:04.930
It would be nice
if your Avatar powers

could be just a little more
specific from time to time.

They imprisoned your leader, Long Feng.

Soon they will turn on all
of you and eliminate you.

01:29.620 --> 01:33.080
Seizing power today
is a matter of life and death.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.420
This coup must be
swift and decisive.

01:36.500 --> 01:38.670
The Earth King, and each
of the five generals,

must be taken out,

you in my command

any hesitation,

01:51.060 --> 01:52.520
I will snuff it out.

01:55.770 --> 01:57.440
That is all.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.150
Nice speech, Azula.

02:01.230 --> 02:04.070
It was pretty and poetic,
but also scary in a good way.

02:04.280 --> 02:07.450
Yeah, I thought you were gonna
make that one guy pee his pants.

02:07.990 --> 02:09.830
There are still a few loose ends―

02:09.950 --> 02:12.450
The Avatar, and my brother and uncle.

02:13.040 --> 02:15.620
Many times, I imagined myself here―

02:15.710 --> 02:18.000
At the threshold of the palace.

02:18.590 --> 02:21.590
But I always thought I would
be here as a conqueror.

02:21.670 --> 02:25.430
Instead, we are the Earth King's
personal guests,

02:25.510 --> 02:27.550
here to serve him tea.

It sure is, Uncle.

TOPH: So, how did it go with the Guru?

02:35.060 --> 02:36.690
Did you master the Avatar State?

Uh...

If you leave now,

They're Earthbenders,

but they have a killer instinct
that's so Firebender.

03:21.440 --> 03:22.570
I just love it.

how I got the nickname

challenge me to an Agni Kai?

04:37.220 --> 04:39.350
I felt so sure that
she was in trouble.

so that when Aang shows up to help me,

know which one of us

12:30.530 --> 12:33.030
You've beaten me at my own game.

12:33.410 --> 12:35.080
Don't flatter yourself.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.910
You were never even a player.

12:39.330 --> 12:41.120
I'm sorry I yelled at you before.

12:41.210 --> 12:42.540
It doesn't matter.

12:42.630 --> 12:44.630
It's just that for so long now,

12:44.710 --> 12:46.960
whenever I would imagine
the face of the enemy,

12:47.050 --> 12:48.300
it was your face.

12:48.590 --> 12:49.920
My face.

12:50.010 --> 12:51.130
I see.

12:51.220 --> 12:53.300
No, no, that's not what I meant.

12:53.390 --> 12:54.640
It's okay.

12:54.720 --> 12:56.720
I used to think this
scar marked me.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.640
The mark of the banished prince,

12:58.730 --> 13:00.770
cursed to chase the Avatar forever.

13:01.100 --> 13:04.310
But lately, I've realized
I'm free to determine

13:04.400 --> 13:08.110
my own destiny, even if
I'll never be free of my mark.

13:08.610 --> 13:10.570
Maybe you could be free of it.

13:10.650 --> 13:13.070
- What?
- I have healing abilities.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.620
It's a scar. It can't be healed.

13:17.450 --> 13:20.330
This is water from the Spirit
Oasis at the North Pole.

13:20.830 --> 13:22.080
It has special properties,

13:22.170 --> 13:25.250
so I've been saving it
for something important.

13:25.330 --> 13:27.250
I don't know if it would work, but...

( ROCKS SHATTERING )

13:37.930 --> 13:39.720
Aang!

13:53.450 --> 13:55.530
Aang, I knew you would come.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.530
Uncle, I don't understand.

13:57.620 --> 13:59.290
What are you doing with the Avatar?

13:59.370 --> 14:00.830
Saving you. That's what.

-( GROANS )
- Zuko, it's time we talked.

14:04.120 --> 14:07.380
Go help your other friends.
We'll catch up with you.

14:15.720 --> 14:17.010
Why, Uncle?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.390
You are not the man you used to be, Zuko.

14:19.680 --> 14:22.140
You are stronger and wiser

14:22.230 --> 14:24.810
and freer than
you have ever been.

14:24.890 --> 14:28.110
And now you have come to
the crossroads of your destiny.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.860
It's time for you to choose.

14:30.940 --> 14:33.360
It's time for you to choose good.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.700
I expected this kind
of treachery from Uncle,

14:40.950 --> 14:45.250
but Zuko, Prince Zuko,
you're a lot of things,

14:45.330 --> 14:47.460
but you're not a traitor, are you?

14:47.540 --> 14:49.210
Release him, immediately!

14:49.460 --> 14:51.550
It's not too late for you, Zuko.

14:51.630 --> 14:53.510
You can still redeem yourself.

14:53.590 --> 14:56.970
The kind of redemption
she offers is not for you.

14:57.180 --> 15:00.140
Why don't you let him decide, Uncle?

15:00.220 --> 15:01.680
I need you, Zuko.

15:01.850 --> 15:04.020
I've plotted every move of this day,

15:04.140 --> 15:06.940
this glorious day in Fire Nation history,

15:07.060 --> 15:09.610
and the only way we win is together.

15:09.690 --> 15:13.030
At the end of this day,
you will have your honor back.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.110
You will have Father's love.

15:15.190 --> 15:17.910
You will have everything you want.

15:17.990 --> 15:20.740
Zuko, I am begging you,

15:21.030 --> 15:25.370
look into your heart and see
what it is that you truly want.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.620
You are free to choose.
