WEBVTT

00:00.125 --> 00:02.583
Previously on
Wizards of Waverly Place.

00:02.583 --> 00:04.833
Felix, I didn't know
you had your own apartment.

00:04.833 --> 00:07.250
Mm-hm. I live on the wizard
floor, down at the Windsor.

00:07.250 --> 00:10.416
Impossible. There are no
wizard floors at the Windsor.

00:10.416 --> 00:14.125
What have you done? Exposing
this floor could ruin my plans!

00:14.125 --> 00:15.416
What plans?

00:15.416 --> 00:17.958
I sense a great evil
at work here.

00:17.958 --> 00:20.750
That's Felix's wand!
You stole Felix's wand!

00:20.750 --> 00:23.583
He cast the "In through
the Out Door" spell.

00:23.583 --> 00:25.625
We're all trapped here?

00:25.625 --> 00:28.625
Yes you are.

00:30.375 --> 00:33.750
Dexter, you can't keep us
trapped on this floor forever.

00:33.750 --> 00:35.958
What's going on?

00:35.958 --> 00:40.708
Dexter's an Angel of Darkness.

00:40.708 --> 00:42.875
And he turned Felix evil

00:42.875 --> 00:45.833
and he has us all trapped
here with the "In through
the Out Door" spell.

00:45.833 --> 00:48.458
How did I nap
through all of that?

00:48.458 --> 00:52.000
I'll try to be louder
next time I do something evil.

00:55.166 --> 00:56.875
OK, nobody panic.

00:56.875 --> 01:00.166
My brother is really smart and
I'm sure he has an undo spell.

01:00.166 --> 01:02.291
I am and I do.

01:02.291 --> 01:04.291
Dexter always wrecks it,
make this door an exit!

01:05.500 --> 01:07.000
It didn't work.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.875
It didn't even glow.
You're making me look bad.

01:09.875 --> 01:12.458
I'm afraid that Felix's
all-powerful wand

01:12.458 --> 01:17.166
has rendered
our powers useless.

01:17.166 --> 01:19.500
Dexter, why are you
doing this to us?

01:19.500 --> 01:23.958
Is it because we never tip you,
or because we make fun of your
ridiculous hat?

01:28.125 --> 01:31.458
How's my hat now?

01:32.833 --> 01:34.250
Dexter is Gorog!

01:34.250 --> 01:36.208
I knew Dexter
was hiding something!

01:36.208 --> 01:38.000
I just thought it was
that he lived with his mom.

01:38.000 --> 01:42.875
My friends, I have lured
you all to the 13th floor

01:42.875 --> 01:46.875
to rebuild my army of darkness.

01:46.875 --> 01:49.416
Nobody's joining
your army of darkness.

01:49.416 --> 01:51.375
Don't forget, I've
defeated you once before.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.000
Don't you think
I thought of that?

01:55.125 --> 01:58.416
You and Justin will remain
trapped on this floor

01:58.416 --> 02:01.000
until your demise.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.125
And the rest of you
will create a portal,

02:04.125 --> 02:08.416
through which we will invade the
wizard world, and take it over.

02:08.416 --> 02:12.958
Felix... continue the mission.

02:14.208 --> 02:16.708
This group of creatures
I divide,

02:16.708 --> 02:18.458
Come with me
and save your hide.

02:22.333 --> 02:24.750
Whew. I was afraid he was
gonna take me with him.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.583
You're a little
too cheery for me.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.958
- Where's my wand?
- And mine?

02:31.958 --> 02:35.875
All of your magical devices
are here in this basket,

02:35.875 --> 02:38.416
along with your
smart phones.

02:38.416 --> 02:41.125
No. I'm not leaving Alex alone!
If she's trapped, then
I'm trapped!

02:41.125 --> 02:43.458
Get back! I'm in charge here.

02:43.458 --> 02:45.500
Mason, do something! Wolf up!

02:45.500 --> 02:47.458
I can't. He's taken that
away from me, too.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.208
Let him go!

02:49.208 --> 02:50.500
Alex!

02:50.500 --> 02:52.000
Mason!

03:45.333 --> 03:46.875
We have got to save
Mason and the others.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.583
Being around Gorog too long
will turn them permanently bad.

03:49.583 --> 03:53.500
I've been around Alex
for a long time, so
I might be immune.

03:53.500 --> 03:55.875
Is this really
the time for that?

03:57.708 --> 03:59.125
Love you.

04:02.708 --> 04:05.708
Wait. Trash Hands is right.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.875
We can just escape
through the trash chute.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.625
Very funny, Trash Hands.

04:24.875 --> 04:26.250
Oh!

04:26.250 --> 04:29.375
Wait, I... I think Trash Hands
meant you, Harper.

04:29.375 --> 04:32.833
Since no wizard can escape,
you're not a wizard,
maybe you can escape.

04:32.833 --> 04:35.250
Then you can get Max
on the Abraca-doodler

04:35.250 --> 04:37.500
and have him contact
the wizard world for help.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.125
You'd be a hero.

04:39.125 --> 04:42.125
A hero? Me?

04:43.166 --> 04:44.375
Well, OK,
I'll do it.

04:44.375 --> 04:47.166
Watch out, wizard world,
I'm coming to save you!

04:54.625 --> 04:58.125
I'm OK! I'm OK,
I landed in the trash.

04:58.125 --> 05:01.000
Alex, are these the pineapple
slippers I made you?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.708
Close it, close it!
Close it.

05:05.833 --> 05:09.125
Welcome to my basement lair.

05:10.458 --> 05:12.875
- Pretty sweet, right?
- Not really.

05:12.875 --> 05:15.875
I would think that the
Angel of Darkness would
have a nicer lair, actually.

05:17.875 --> 05:21.375
You should have seen my
rooftop Realm of Darkness.

05:21.375 --> 05:23.333
That was really sweet.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.083
But I lost it!

05:26.083 --> 05:31.208
My powers have weakened
since Alex defeated me.

05:31.208 --> 05:36.875
But that will change
soon enough when I turn
you all to the dark side.

05:38.416 --> 05:40.875
My, you're an awfully
mighty giant, aren't you?

05:40.875 --> 05:42.458
Thank you.

05:46.875 --> 05:52.166
Master Gorog. I am an evil
giant at your service.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.416
I like the bow.
That's a nice touch.

05:58.083 --> 06:01.000
Stay as far from
Gorog as you can

06:01.000 --> 06:04.000
so his influence
won't be as strong.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.333
And resist it by thinking
about your loved ones.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.958
All I can think about is Alex
trapped on that 13th floor.

06:09.958 --> 06:12.166
That's good.
Keep thinking of her.

06:12.166 --> 06:15.458
She's pretty, lazy and her
breath smells like pickles.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.458
I will not succumb
to the dark side.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.291
- Good.
- Pretty, lazy, pickles.

06:20.291 --> 06:23.125
Pretty, lazy, pickles.
Pretty, lazy, pickles...

06:26.083 --> 06:28.458
What are you telling him?

06:28.458 --> 06:32.583
Oh! That I am no match
for your power.

06:32.583 --> 06:36.875
Oh, really? I thought you would
be the toughest to influence.

06:39.583 --> 06:42.166
I am at your service,
Master Gorog!

06:43.333 --> 06:46.416
I have to say, I'm loving
the bow.

06:51.125 --> 06:55.000
All right, it's time for all
of you to begin the arduous task

06:55.000 --> 06:57.958
of digging the
inter-dimensional tunnel,

06:57.958 --> 07:01.833
so that we can create a portal
to the wizard world.

07:01.833 --> 07:06.625
Felix, begin our
first step to conquest!

07:06.625 --> 07:11.416
With this most powerful wand, I
bust a hole to the world beyond!

07:20.250 --> 07:23.416
All right, everybody,
line up and commence digging.

07:27.125 --> 07:30.416
I've got the first
huge boulder, Master Gorog!

07:38.708 --> 07:42.333
Get me Max at Wizard Camp.

07:42.333 --> 07:45.375
Max, Alex and Justin are
in trouble. You've got
to come back now.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.875
Harper, I'm next
to climb the rock wall.

07:47.875 --> 07:49.583
Oh!

07:52.125 --> 07:53.875
All right, ready to go.

07:58.250 --> 08:00.583
Max, Justin and Alex
are trapped by Gorog.

08:00.583 --> 08:02.125
- What do we do?
- Hey, no problem.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.583
We just do what Justin does
whenever there's a dire
situation.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.958
Oh, thank you. Yes!

08:06.958 --> 08:09.708
- And what is that?
- We look in books.

08:10.875 --> 08:13.000
That's your big plan?
To look in spell books?

08:13.000 --> 08:14.625
That's even better!
Spell books!

08:23.875 --> 08:26.458
These smart phones
are addicting.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.583
Master Gorog...

08:31.458 --> 08:33.625
We've hit the atmosphere
of the wizard world.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.083
We're almost there.

08:35.083 --> 08:40.125
Yes! We are now primed
to take over the wizard world.

08:40.125 --> 08:46.000
Felix, get rid of Alex and
Justin Russo once and for all.

08:46.000 --> 08:48.958
Gorog, there is no need
to destroy the Russos!

08:48.958 --> 08:51.500
Oh, the last to turn

08:51.500 --> 08:53.583
is always the one
who's in love.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.083
But I will not
be stopped by Alex,

08:57.083 --> 08:59.833
or any Russo,
ever again.

08:59.833 --> 09:02.583
That's why I sent
Max away to wizard camp.

09:02.583 --> 09:07.500
And once I get rid of Alex
and Justin, I will truly
have nothing to fear.

09:07.500 --> 09:10.000
Except for me.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.958
Still nothing!

09:17.958 --> 09:21.458
Mason, help me
rule the wizard world,

09:21.458 --> 09:24.208
and you'll be able to
wolf up whenever you want to.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.208
You'll be the top dog
in my operation.

09:27.208 --> 09:30.291
- You're housebroken, right?
- Of course I am!

09:31.250 --> 09:32.958
But I will not help you.

09:32.958 --> 09:35.458
Oh, I believe you will.

09:35.458 --> 09:39.875
- Never!
- Just let go.

09:42.500 --> 09:45.291
I will work for you,
Master Gorog.

09:45.291 --> 09:48.708
Uh, hello? The bow.

09:57.166 --> 10:00.125
Felix...
cast that spell.

10:03.375 --> 10:06.708
Black hole open in 13B,

10:06.708 --> 10:08.875
darker and wider than the sea.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.583
Yeah, very nice.

10:13.583 --> 10:15.958
But remind me when I
take over the wizard world,

10:15.958 --> 10:19.291
to take all those rhymes
out of the spells. They bug me.

10:23.625 --> 10:25.583
We have to do something.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.083
I can't just sit around here and
wait for someone to come help.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.416
Me neither.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.375
How can you make toast
at a time like this?

10:35.375 --> 10:39.125
Harper forgot to buy cereal,
so toast is all we've got.

10:40.875 --> 10:44.125
Justin... what's that little
hole that's getting bigger?

10:48.375 --> 10:50.708
It's a black hole.
Gorog must have put that there.

10:52.583 --> 10:55.208
Oh man, the remote
was on there!

10:55.208 --> 10:56.583
How are we gonna watch TV now?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.708
Never mind. Help!

11:07.708 --> 11:09.583
Excellent work, everyone.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.875
All right, line up
and get your wands,

11:11.875 --> 11:14.708
so that you'll have them when
we invade the wizard world.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.583
Who's first?

11:16.583 --> 11:17.750
All right.

11:20.750 --> 11:22.000
Oh, yeah.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.166
Uh... Which one is yours?

11:31.166 --> 11:34.333
Mine's the one with
the crumbs in the handle.

11:34.333 --> 11:36.875
Ah... Oh, yeah.

11:36.875 --> 11:38.500
Eww.

11:48.583 --> 11:51.708
All right, Felix,
shoot the activation orb.

11:52.708 --> 11:55.000
The moment the portal
is activated,

11:55.000 --> 11:57.875
the wizard world
will be mine.

11:57.875 --> 12:00.125
- Yes, Master Gorog.
- Gorog...

12:01.500 --> 12:03.291
...before you
fire that orb,

12:03.291 --> 12:05.333
aren't you forgetting
one small thing?

12:05.333 --> 12:07.125
Yeah, what's that?

12:07.125 --> 12:09.458
That I will not
allow it to happen!

12:10.958 --> 12:13.208
I should've known
it'd be more difficult

12:13.208 --> 12:14.875
to make you see things my way!

12:14.875 --> 12:17.166
- Give me the wand!
- Never!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.875
Oh, no! The orb has
entered the tunnel!

12:25.166 --> 12:27.416
Felix, destroy him.

12:28.708 --> 12:30.583
Yes, Master Gorog.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.208
Hey... Ahh!

12:38.166 --> 12:41.208
I did it.
I destroyed Professor Crumbs.

12:41.208 --> 12:44.875
And that's the way
the professor crumbles.

12:46.250 --> 12:49.208
All right, it's a bit cheesy,
but you get the idea.

12:50.625 --> 12:54.333
All right, as soon
as the activation light

12:54.333 --> 12:58.875
turns completely white,
I will have my portal.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.000
Prepare yourselves,

13:01.000 --> 13:05.083
for we are about to
invade the wizard world!

13:14.625 --> 13:16.583
I need a spell book. Did you
bring any books from the lair

13:16.583 --> 13:18.000
to study for
the wizard competition?

13:18.000 --> 13:20.083
No, I moved out to have fun!

13:22.458 --> 13:24.875
Are you having fun now?

13:31.125 --> 13:34.291
I got it! I found a spell
that's gonna work! Read that.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.708
A "Get Your Brother and Sister
Out of a Giant Pumpkin" spell?

13:37.708 --> 13:41.750
Yeah, so we just gotta get them
out of their apartment and into
a pumpkin and then we're good.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.250
Professor Crumbs?

13:47.250 --> 13:50.083
Oh! I apologize for my attire,

13:50.083 --> 13:54.083
but I had to do whatever
necessary to escape from Gorog.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.708
Gorog trapped you, too?

13:55.708 --> 13:59.875
Yes, he intends on taking
over the wizard world.

13:59.875 --> 14:04.708
But I may have bought us
some time by switching
a fake wand for Felix's.

14:04.708 --> 14:06.625
Oh, great! That wand
can do anything.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.291
Why don't you use it
to stop Gorog?

14:08.291 --> 14:11.125
Ah, only Felix
can use this wand.

14:11.125 --> 14:12.583
Oh, then what am I
saying "great" for?

14:12.583 --> 14:15.000
No, I was with you, it was
great there for a moment.

14:16.375 --> 14:19.166
I'm sorry, but who are you?

14:19.166 --> 14:22.000
I'm Alex's friend, Harper.

14:22.000 --> 14:26.208
Uh-huh. And how is it
you know about wizardry?

14:27.375 --> 14:29.875
How is it I know
about wizardry?

14:31.625 --> 14:34.875
Well, I just saw you
flash in here out of nowhere.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.500
Amazing. I'm blown away.

14:38.000 --> 14:40.875
But isn't exposing magic
a big no-no?

14:40.875 --> 14:43.250
I mean, I'm guessing.

14:45.708 --> 14:48.708
Let's just keep this
to ourselves.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.208
The more important
issue here is that Gorog

14:52.208 --> 14:56.875
cast a Black Hole spell
on Alex and Justin.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.000
By the way, have you been
in contact with them?

14:59.000 --> 15:01.375
No. We've been trying
to find the right spell.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.291
Have you tried the telephone?

15:08.208 --> 15:10.500
See, that's why they
call him, the "Professor."

15:10.500 --> 15:11.583
Yeah.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.291
Alex and Harper's apartment.

15:22.625 --> 15:25.083
Alex, this is Professor Crumbs.

15:25.083 --> 15:28.583
Oh, Professor Crumbs,
now is not a really
good time for me.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.708
- But I can call you tomorrow...
- Give me that.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.583
Professor Crumbs,
we are doomed!

15:32.583 --> 15:36.458
We are falling into a black
hole and we need help!

15:36.458 --> 15:37.583
Professor Crumbs, I got it!

15:37.583 --> 15:39.458
Why don't we get 'em
out of the black hole

15:39.458 --> 15:42.875
by just going
into the black hole?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.708
- That's idiotic.
- No, it's not.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.708
Not if you cast a
Black Hole spell right there

15:47.708 --> 15:50.000
and hold onto this rope
while I go in and get them.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.958
It's genius!
Now I'm feeling idiotic.

15:55.625 --> 15:58.083
Roly poley, holy moley.

16:00.458 --> 16:04.875
I never thought I'd
say this, but Max is
on his way to save you.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.416
Did he just say Max
is gonna come save us?

16:09.416 --> 16:12.208
Yes! So this is
the end for us.

16:14.416 --> 16:16.333
I'm gonna have some
of that toast now.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.000
Someone call for a rescue?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.375
Max, you made it!

16:23.375 --> 16:25.708
I've never been this
happy to see you.

16:25.708 --> 16:27.583
- Hey, how was camp?
- It was good.

16:27.583 --> 16:30.333
I learned how to rock climb,
work with some leather.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.000
Here, wrap this
around you, all right?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.583
Harper and Professor Crumbs
will pull us back to safety.

16:34.583 --> 16:37.750
Now remember, none of them
have any upper-body strength
whatsoever,

16:37.750 --> 16:39.083
so it's gonna take a while.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.458
On three, ready?

16:41.458 --> 16:43.458
One, two three!

16:46.000 --> 16:48.875
Work through the burn!
Work through the burn!

16:48.875 --> 16:50.583
Work through the burn!

16:55.750 --> 16:58.458
- We're saved!
- Max, you're a hero.

16:58.458 --> 17:01.708
But you said I'd be a hero
if I went down the trash chute.

17:01.708 --> 17:04.333
Let's be honest, Harper,
you were just trying
to save yourself.

17:05.333 --> 17:07.333
Excuse me for interrupting,

17:07.333 --> 17:09.333
but Gorog has
completed his portal

17:09.333 --> 17:12.833
and is about to invade
the wizard world.

17:12.833 --> 17:14.875
The only thing that
might be able to stop him

17:14.875 --> 17:17.125
is for you three
to use your powers.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.208
Wait... What do you mean?

17:19.208 --> 17:22.291
Three wizard siblings using
their magic power together

17:22.291 --> 17:24.583
generates immense power.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.291
And why didn't you
tell us this before?

17:27.291 --> 17:29.833
If I did, would you have
taken advantage of it?

17:29.833 --> 17:31.750
You did the right thing.

17:33.208 --> 17:35.833
Remember, you're our only hope.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.333
No pressure.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.458
You can't drive a truckload
of pressure in here

17:41.458 --> 17:42.958
and then say, "No pressure."

17:44.708 --> 17:46.500
All right, so we need
three wizards.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.875
One, two...
We're short one.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.458
- Count yourself.
- Three. OK, we're good.

17:54.416 --> 17:56.583
Yes!

17:58.583 --> 18:00.583
Now that the portal
is activated,

18:00.583 --> 18:04.958
I will lead you as
the new force of darkness

18:04.958 --> 18:07.583
into the wizard world!

18:07.583 --> 18:11.333
Conquest is mine!

18:11.333 --> 18:13.583
Oh! Oh!

18:14.625 --> 18:16.375
Gorog! Gorog, stop!

18:17.625 --> 18:21.625
What? You escaped
the black hole?

18:21.625 --> 18:26.458
And I see Max has escaped
his fun outdoor nature camp.

18:26.458 --> 18:29.083
And to think, I made you a
leather friendship bracelet.

18:29.083 --> 18:31.708
Felix, destroy them.

18:31.708 --> 18:33.583
Yes, Master Gorog.

18:39.375 --> 18:40.500
What's the problem?

18:40.500 --> 18:42.500
That wand's a fake.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.083
Professor Crumbs switched them.

18:44.083 --> 18:46.208
How could this happen?!

18:46.208 --> 18:48.750
Well, I will not be stopped.

18:48.750 --> 18:53.291
Everyone, take out your wands
and destroy the Russos.

19:02.500 --> 19:04.958
Alex, listen to Master Gorog.

19:04.958 --> 19:06.583
You have no chance.

19:06.583 --> 19:08.875
Save yourselves
and join our side.

19:10.833 --> 19:14.333
Mason, there may only be three
of us, but we will never
surrender to Gorog.

19:14.333 --> 19:15.583
Right, Alex?

19:17.708 --> 19:18.750
Alex.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.708
- Right.
- Alex, don't listen to him!

19:22.708 --> 19:24.375
Don't cave in for love.

19:24.375 --> 19:27.000
Oh, really, Justin?

19:27.000 --> 19:28.708
Because there is someone here

19:28.708 --> 19:31.625
that I think you might want
to be reacquainted with.

19:35.291 --> 19:36.458
Hello, Justin.

19:38.750 --> 19:39.958
Juliet!

19:39.958 --> 19:43.125
Is... Is that really you?

19:43.125 --> 19:45.125
It is.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.625
Master Gorog promised me
we'd be together again.

19:48.625 --> 19:53.291
- You joined the dark side?
- Oh, it's not that bad, Justin.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.750
Come on, join us.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.250
But...

19:59.125 --> 20:01.458
I... I can't.

20:01.458 --> 20:03.458
- I won't.
- Guys, stay strong.

20:03.458 --> 20:04.958
We have to save
the wizard world.

20:11.500 --> 20:13.500
I'm sorry, Max.

20:16.750 --> 20:18.875
Well done, Justin.

20:18.875 --> 20:20.583
Welcome back!

20:23.750 --> 20:25.750
Alex, there's still two of us.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.583
Please stay with me.

20:28.458 --> 20:29.875
What's the point, Max?

20:31.000 --> 20:33.208
Our combined powers
won't be strong enough.

20:37.833 --> 20:41.333
Very good, Alex.
Come on!

20:46.708 --> 20:48.500
I don't... I don't believe this.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.583
How could it end this way?

20:52.708 --> 20:55.458
Wise move,
little camper.

20:56.458 --> 20:58.208
Oh, boy!

20:58.208 --> 21:03.250
I have finally defeated
the power of the Russos!

21:06.875 --> 21:08.875
Hear these
three Russo cry,

21:08.875 --> 21:10.583
be gone, Gorog, vaporize!

21:10.583 --> 21:12.875
What? What are you doing?

21:12.875 --> 21:14.083
It's a trick!

21:21.416 --> 21:24.208
- It worked!
- We did it!

21:24.208 --> 21:26.166
Anybody else smell
fried chicken?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.875
Oh, Justin, I'm so sorry.
I was under his influence.

21:33.875 --> 21:35.708
Who cares? You're here.

21:35.708 --> 21:37.500
I never gave up.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.291
I knew that somehow, someday,
we'd be together again.

21:40.291 --> 21:42.375
I knew it, too.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.250
Alex, you're my hero.

21:45.250 --> 21:47.750
People do throw "hero"
around a lot, huh?

21:49.875 --> 21:52.416
Well, Felix, since
everyone else is hugging.

21:52.416 --> 21:55.708
- Come here, big guy.
- Yeah.

21:55.708 --> 21:57.458
Come on, you.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.416
Aw, look at us.

22:06.416 --> 22:08.208
We are a freaky bunch.

22:13.583 --> 22:15.708
All right, everyone.
I talked to my parents,

22:15.708 --> 22:18.750
and since we all lost
our 13th floor apartments,

22:18.750 --> 22:21.958
you're welcome to stay here
as long as you want until
you find a new place to live.

22:21.958 --> 22:23.416
Thanks, Alex.

22:24.708 --> 22:26.458
Can I sleep next to her?

22:32.000 --> 22:34.291
Stop it.

22:34.291 --> 22:37.625
Can Abercrombie sleep outside?
He kind of reeks.

22:37.625 --> 22:41.166
Ooh, I can cover that one up.

22:42.875 --> 22:46.000
OK, yeah, I never thought
that dingy, old basement

22:46.000 --> 22:48.000
would look so good.
Good night, you guys.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.458
OK, everybody, thanks
for helping me get Harper
back in the basement.

22:55.458 --> 22:58.083
No problem, Alex.
Come on, you guys.
