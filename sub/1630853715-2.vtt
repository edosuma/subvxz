00:06.189 --> 00:07.559
NADJA:
Our work on converting
the Vampiric Council

00:07.592 --> 00:08.728
into a vampire nightclub

00:08.761 --> 00:11.600
is not going well.

00:11.634 --> 00:14.472
Stop the work! Stop the work!

00:14.506 --> 00:15.808
NADJA:
The custodian of this

00:15.842 --> 00:17.779
wonderful raw space
is being something

00:17.812 --> 00:20.718
of a total harpy in my ass.

00:20.752 --> 00:23.323
Continue the work.
Continue the work.

00:23.356 --> 00:25.093
Ignore her, keep working.

00:25.127 --> 00:27.131
My voice reigns supreme.

00:27.164 --> 00:29.101
I have been in charge
of this sacred reliquary

00:29.135 --> 00:30.437
for hundreds of years.

00:30.470 --> 00:32.676
You can't just dismantle it all.

00:32.709 --> 00:35.748
NADJA:
We're not dismantling anything,
we're just moving things around.

00:35.782 --> 00:39.088
-Oh.
-There is a very specific
filing system here.

00:39.121 --> 00:42.428
-Which is?
-Which is everything
stays exactly where it is

00:42.461 --> 00:44.298
and nothing gets moved
or changed ever.

00:44.332 --> 00:45.602
Are you sure you don't
want to protect

00:45.635 --> 00:47.104
your precious books
by putting them

00:47.137 --> 00:48.473
into storage
so they don't get damaged

00:48.507 --> 00:50.578
by my blood sprinklers?

00:50.612 --> 00:52.448
Blood sprinklers?

00:52.481 --> 00:54.820
No, no, no. This is not right.
Put it all back.

00:54.853 --> 00:56.422
You can get fucked.
This took hours.

00:56.456 --> 00:58.594
Oh, I wasn't talking to you.

00:59.763 --> 01:01.332
LASZLO:
What the fuck?

01:01.366 --> 01:02.802
NADJA:
Fucking wraiths.

01:05.140 --> 01:10.083
Anything you can do,
my wraiths can undo.

01:10.117 --> 01:13.491
This conversation is over.

01:53.871 --> 01:56.409
I do not own a dog.

01:56.442 --> 02:00.518
-I only come here
to speak to you.
-Oh.

02:00.551 --> 02:02.522
NANDOR:
My search for a new wife has...

02:02.555 --> 02:04.593
not been going so great.

02:04.626 --> 02:08.534
I used to have
37 beautiful wives.

02:08.567 --> 02:10.404
But that was hundreds
of years ago.

02:10.437 --> 02:12.308
Now I have no one.

02:12.341 --> 02:14.378
But I have a plan.

02:16.182 --> 02:20.591
I secretly smuggled back
850 pounds of ancestral treasure

02:20.625 --> 02:22.662
from Al Qolnidar.

02:22.696 --> 02:24.533
I thought my ancestral treasure

02:24.566 --> 02:27.338
would make
a very impressive dowry.

02:27.371 --> 02:29.342
But it seems,

02:29.375 --> 02:33.450
for modern women,
it's just not enough.

02:33.483 --> 02:35.354
I am not a creep.

02:35.387 --> 02:37.559
I'm just a very powerful
and ancient warrior

02:37.592 --> 02:39.496
who wishes to marry you.

02:39.529 --> 02:42.769
So I'd like you to come back
to the basement of my mansion

02:42.802 --> 02:45.808
and examine my massive dowry.

02:45.842 --> 02:46.844
Hmm?

02:46.877 --> 02:48.614
So, here I am,

02:48.647 --> 02:52.622
surrounded by all
my secret treasures

02:52.655 --> 02:55.828
but without a wife
to share them with.

02:55.862 --> 02:59.235
And, yes, I have kept
my secret treasure secret

02:59.268 --> 03:01.907
from even my housemates.

03:01.940 --> 03:04.746
No one will ever know
the precious riches

03:04.780 --> 03:06.282
-that I have hidden deep...
-GUILLERMO: Master?

03:06.315 --> 03:07.719
What the fuck? Guillermo?

03:07.752 --> 03:10.457
How did you get in here?
The door was locked.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.495
Wh-- How long have you had
this secret room for?

03:12.529 --> 03:15.267
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.
Is this stuff real?

03:15.300 --> 03:16.837
Sure, just come on down
to my secret treasure room,

03:16.870 --> 03:18.273
why don't you?
Don't touch that.

03:18.306 --> 03:19.643
-Ow.
-Of course it's real.

03:19.676 --> 03:21.580
The aggravations are endless.

03:21.613 --> 03:24.986
I am paying a full crew
of workermen to do nothing.

03:25.020 --> 03:27.525
-You know what I think
this stairway needs, Tobe?
-What's that?

03:27.559 --> 03:29.428
Hey, I bet they do
a shiplap accent wall.

03:29.462 --> 03:31.432
-Watch.
-...a shiplap accent wall.

03:31.466 --> 03:34.238
Man, come on, these guys have,
like, two go-to moves at best.

03:34.271 --> 03:35.908
No, that's where
you're fucking wrong.

03:35.942 --> 03:38.313
Bran and Toby
choose to use shiplap

03:38.346 --> 03:41.319
because it has the perfect
amount of artistic flair

03:41.352 --> 03:42.789
for any aesthetic.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.659
Also, not a budget-buster.

03:44.693 --> 03:46.563
Did you want to do shiplap
on this wall?

03:46.597 --> 03:48.634
-Where?
-Just, like, right over here?

03:48.667 --> 03:50.538
Well, if you've got some.

03:50.571 --> 03:53.309
Every time I persuade
the workermen to work,

03:53.343 --> 03:55.915
The Guide and her wraiths
undermine me.

03:55.948 --> 03:57.652
-Hey. Hey!
-Whoa, whoa!

03:57.685 --> 03:59.856
(Nadja groans)

03:59.890 --> 04:03.564
I told Nadja it wasn't safe
for her crew to be working here,

04:03.597 --> 04:05.968
but she doesn't listen.

04:06.002 --> 04:07.972
(worker screams)

04:08.006 --> 04:10.410
I have tried using the carrot,
as one does

04:10.444 --> 04:14.686
with a stubborn donkey, but now
it is time for the stick!

04:14.719 --> 04:16.924
I must ask you
about some of the things

04:16.957 --> 04:20.698
I overheard them saying when
I was working in, um, England

04:20.731 --> 04:23.671
at the Supreme Vampiric Council.

04:23.704 --> 04:25.908
(chuckles):
Oh. Did they speak about me

04:25.942 --> 04:27.745
and my dedicated work here?

04:27.779 --> 04:29.583
-I shouldn't say, no.
-Oh.

04:29.616 --> 04:31.587
Okay, I'll tell you.

04:31.620 --> 04:34.391
Yeah, so, some of them
were definitely saying

04:34.425 --> 04:36.028
that they think that this branch
of the Vampiric Council

04:36.062 --> 04:38.601
is very much stuck in time,

04:38.634 --> 04:41.305
and that the real estate
would probably be more valuable

04:41.339 --> 04:45.347
if they leased it out
to a... CVS Pharmacy.

04:45.380 --> 04:47.050
Who said that?

04:47.084 --> 04:49.355
The main one.

04:49.388 --> 04:50.558
Dark Lord Tyrantus?

04:50.591 --> 04:53.731
The Liquidator of Underlings?

04:53.764 --> 04:54.900
Him-- that's him.

04:54.933 --> 04:57.337
Uh, okay, uh...

04:57.371 --> 04:58.841
(softly):
What do I do?

04:58.874 --> 05:00.578
Okay!

05:00.611 --> 05:02.615
Let's do this! Uh...

05:02.649 --> 05:05.387
Wraith meeting! Wraith meeting!

05:05.420 --> 05:08.092
Hey, uh, stop
injuring crew workers

05:08.126 --> 05:10.631
-and assemble for
an official wraith meeting.
-(worker screams)

05:10.665 --> 05:11.700
All right, that's the last one.

05:18.647 --> 05:20.618
Ah, yes.

05:20.651 --> 05:23.924
Any woman in ancient Al Qolnidar
would throw herself at my feet

05:23.958 --> 05:26.028
if she knew
I had a spoon like this.

05:26.062 --> 05:29.001
Well, most modern women have
access to spoons already, so...

05:29.034 --> 05:31.038
We live in a time of miracles.

05:31.072 --> 05:32.909
No.

05:32.942 --> 05:34.345
What's this?

05:34.378 --> 05:36.517
-Oh, just a djinn lamp.
-A what?

05:36.550 --> 05:39.388
A djinn lamp.
Like in the old stories.

05:39.421 --> 05:42.795
You-you rub it and a magical man
comes out and grants you wishes.

05:42.829 --> 05:45.400
Oh, a genie lamp.

05:45.433 --> 05:46.803
It is a djinn lamp.

05:46.837 --> 05:48.807
Uh, the ancient tales
say it is magical,

05:48.841 --> 05:52.014
but like most of the ancient
tales, it is all horseshit.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.485
-Well, then rub it.
-I rubbed hundreds
of djinn lamps

05:54.519 --> 05:56.690
as a child,
nothing ever happened. See?

05:56.723 --> 05:58.494
Nothing.

05:58.527 --> 06:00.397
Well, did you ever rub it
counterclockwise?

06:00.430 --> 06:02.467
Eh, rub, rub, rub. See? Nothing.

06:02.502 --> 06:03.771
(rumbling)

06:03.804 --> 06:05.006
What is happening?!

06:07.077 --> 06:08.379
You rubbed it a hundred times
and never thought

06:08.413 --> 06:09.683
about rubbing it the other way?!

06:09.716 --> 06:10.685
NANDOR:
We are about to die,

06:10.718 --> 06:11.687
and this is what you want

06:11.720 --> 06:12.789
your last words to be?!

06:14.926 --> 06:16.830
(rumbling stops)

06:16.863 --> 06:19.502
Okay. It stopped.

06:19.536 --> 06:21.807
-Hey.
-Hey, yo...

06:22.842 --> 06:25.080
NANDOR:
Oh, hey.

06:25.113 --> 06:26.650
Are you a djinn?

06:26.683 --> 06:28.052
Yes.

06:28.086 --> 06:29.455
You don't look like a djinn.

06:29.488 --> 06:31.425
-You can't say that.
-I just did.

06:31.459 --> 06:33.429
Thank you all for coming.

06:33.463 --> 06:36.570
Would you like me to explain
what we require of them?

06:36.603 --> 06:37.972
No, I'll handle it.
I'm just waiting

06:38.006 --> 06:39.542
for the rest of them
to get here.

06:39.576 --> 06:40.845
I don't want to say it twice.

06:40.878 --> 06:43.550
-(gasps)
-Um...

06:43.584 --> 06:46.122
I say, exactly
how many wraiths are there?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.426
GUIDE:
So, so many. And so many of them

06:48.459 --> 06:50.564
are habitual stragglers!

06:50.598 --> 06:52.434
-(laughs softly)
-Mm.

06:52.467 --> 06:54.138
GUIDE:
Okay, I guess they're all here.

06:54.171 --> 06:55.875
(clears throat)

06:55.908 --> 06:57.845
-Hear me, my wraiths!
-WRAITHS (whispering): Yes...

06:57.879 --> 07:01.820
For today
we embark on a new mission.

07:01.853 --> 07:03.857
-(wraiths whispering sibilantly)
-Oh. (groans)

07:03.891 --> 07:07.665
Now, many changes will be
made to this building.

07:07.699 --> 07:11.439
And your duty
heretoforth is to help

07:11.472 --> 07:13.009
the human workers...

07:13.042 --> 07:15.615
-Help.
-...and to not harm
the human workers.

07:15.648 --> 07:17.885
-Don't harm them.
-Am I understood?

07:17.919 --> 07:19.623
WRAITHS:
Yes...

07:19.656 --> 07:22.227
All right.
Now we will organize ourselves

07:22.260 --> 07:25.233
into work squads,
and within those squads

07:25.266 --> 07:28.641
-we will decide who does...
-Ooh, sorry, this is not
the john...

07:28.674 --> 07:30.477
(whispering sibilantly)

07:30.511 --> 07:32.882
-GUIDE: Wait.
-(worker screaming)

07:32.915 --> 07:35.755
-(crunching)
-Ooh.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.959
Uh, what did we just say?!

07:37.992 --> 07:40.831
GUIDE:
Oh, no. I was worried

07:40.865 --> 07:42.467
about this happening.

07:42.502 --> 07:44.906
You see, the wraiths and I
have been together

07:44.939 --> 07:48.514
for so long that no matter
what I tell them to do,

07:48.547 --> 07:51.052
they know what
my heart really wants.

07:51.085 --> 07:52.922
Well, maybe you should tell
your heart to think of some...

07:52.955 --> 07:54.926
It's all right, my darling.
I think I can deal with this.

07:54.959 --> 07:57.064
So, logically you're prepared

07:57.097 --> 07:59.001
for change, yet your inner,

07:59.034 --> 08:00.905
uncontrollable emotions
are resisting.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.842
Would I be right?

08:04.111 --> 08:05.280
What?

08:05.313 --> 08:08.086
I think can fix her.

08:08.119 --> 08:10.056
Psychology is considered to be

08:10.090 --> 08:11.526
one of the newer sciences.

08:11.560 --> 08:12.996
Isn't really new to me at all.

08:13.029 --> 08:14.933
In fact, I was there
at its conception.

08:14.966 --> 08:17.739
I spent a few of my younger
years with Sigmund Freud,

08:17.772 --> 08:20.878
while he was using cocaine
and working on his theory

08:20.911 --> 08:22.782
that all neurosis is derived

08:22.815 --> 08:24.786
from what he called "hand envy."

08:24.819 --> 08:26.556
I remember taking
a steam bath with the chap,

08:26.590 --> 08:29.161
and my towel
accidentally dropped,

08:29.194 --> 08:32.635
and he caught sight of my rather
generous John Thomas.

08:32.668 --> 08:36.977
He shrieked "Eureka," and then
came up with "penis envy."

08:37.010 --> 08:39.849
Or what I like to call
"wanting of the wang."

08:39.883 --> 08:41.118
(puffs)

08:41.152 --> 08:43.256
So, how many wishes
can you grant?

08:43.289 --> 08:44.759
Do you wish to know?

08:44.793 --> 08:45.761
-No, don't...
-Sure.

08:45.795 --> 08:47.030
Well, it's 52.

08:47.064 --> 08:49.636
But you just used one,
so it's 51.

08:49.669 --> 08:51.573
-(grumbles)
-Don't wish it.

08:51.606 --> 08:53.209
NANDOR:
My first thought was,

08:53.242 --> 08:55.948
I will just wish the djinn
to get me a new love.

08:55.981 --> 09:00.256
But then I remembered
I had already found love.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.731
I had 37 wives, and one of them,

09:03.764 --> 09:07.839
I specifically remember,
I really loved.

09:09.843 --> 09:12.347
I just cannot remember
which one.

09:12.380 --> 09:14.619
-Hmm...
-So, what was her name?

09:14.652 --> 09:16.857
It might have been a he.
They weren't all women.

09:16.890 --> 09:19.094
-You could do that back then?
-Of course.

09:19.128 --> 09:20.664
Some of my wives
were girl wives,

09:20.698 --> 09:22.200
some of them were guy wives.

09:22.234 --> 09:23.704
It's not that different.

09:23.737 --> 09:24.873
Hmm.

09:24.906 --> 09:26.075
I cannot remember the name,

09:26.108 --> 09:27.678
but either he or she had

09:27.712 --> 09:29.281
very long, dark hair.

09:29.314 --> 09:31.586
28 of them had long, dark hair.

09:31.620 --> 09:33.957
Hmm. I want to say Becky?

09:33.991 --> 09:35.126
-No.
-Hmm.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.030
NANDOR:
How about Dalal?

09:37.063 --> 09:39.903
I think I remember him having
a very fun handlebar mustache.

09:39.936 --> 09:41.873
-There were three Dalals.
-Three.

09:41.907 --> 09:43.911
(sighs) You know what?
Just bring them

09:43.944 --> 09:45.781
all back
and we'll figure it out.

09:45.815 --> 09:47.150
I don't think that's the most
efficient way to deal with...

09:47.184 --> 09:48.720
Uh, is this your wish?

09:48.754 --> 09:51.325
Yes. This is my wish.

09:51.358 --> 09:55.266
I wish you to bring back
all 37 of my dead wives.

09:55.300 --> 09:56.770
Very well.

09:56.803 --> 09:57.905
(indistinct chatter nearby)

09:57.939 --> 09:59.609
Oh, boy.

10:02.682 --> 10:04.652
(exclaims)

10:04.686 --> 10:06.656
Greetings, my wives.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.927
(rising chatter)

10:08.961 --> 10:10.330
Hi.

10:10.363 --> 10:12.635
Nandor...
(speaking Farsi)

10:16.375 --> 10:19.081
Yes, hello to you, too,
I want to say Mina?

10:19.114 --> 10:21.085
-(all gasping)
-Miriam?

10:21.118 --> 10:22.955
-Zahra.
-That's it.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.893
I also wish for them all
to speak English.

10:24.926 --> 10:26.195
...Fatemeh said you were
going to return

10:26.228 --> 10:27.732
-when the moon was next full.
-Did she?

10:27.765 --> 10:29.301
But we waited
three full moon cycles,

10:29.334 --> 10:30.905
-and guess what. Nothing.
-Oh, three? Sorry about that.

10:30.938 --> 10:32.207
Which is very disrespectful
not just to me

10:32.240 --> 10:33.677
-but to my father...
-Let me go check

10:33.710 --> 10:34.679
and I'll get
right back to you...

10:34.712 --> 10:37.350
(overlapping chatter)

10:37.384 --> 10:39.221
(all shouting)

10:39.254 --> 10:41.693
Give me one moment! Uh,
everything will be normal soon.

10:41.726 --> 10:44.031
-How long must I stare
at the...?
-I don't know.

10:44.064 --> 10:45.968
-(pounding on door)
-How long, Nandor?

10:46.001 --> 10:47.370
Okay, so it's definitely
not her.

10:47.404 --> 10:49.308
Guillermo, I'm going
to need you to install

10:49.341 --> 10:51.078
37 bunk beds in the attic.

10:51.111 --> 10:53.115
-(pounding on door)
-MAN: Open!

10:53.149 --> 10:54.451
-LASZLO: Keep going.
-I've been watching over

10:54.484 --> 10:56.990
this building
for hundreds of years.

10:57.023 --> 11:01.031
I'm so intertwined with it,
I feel any changes physically,

11:01.065 --> 11:02.902
in my own body.

11:02.935 --> 11:06.375
What, you mean,
like something sexual?

11:06.408 --> 11:09.849
More like, if there is a brick
that gets chipped,

11:09.883 --> 11:11.720
I get a headache.

11:11.753 --> 11:15.193
If the steam pipes are backed
up, then I am also backed up.

11:15.226 --> 11:17.264
-Nothing sexy.
-I'm just gonna ignore

11:17.297 --> 11:20.971
most of that and put that down
to your female hysteria.

11:21.005 --> 11:23.877
-Hmm.
-Moving on, the thought
of changing this building,

11:23.911 --> 11:26.983
-how does that make you feel?
-Bad.

11:27.017 --> 11:30.958
If anything gets changed here,
something very bad will happen.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.262
-Could you give me an example?
-I just have an overpowering

11:33.296 --> 11:37.204
"bad things will happen" energy,
and it's flowing through me.

11:37.237 --> 11:40.109
Do you mean a sexual sensation?

11:40.143 --> 11:42.414
No, it's more like,
when you enter a room...

11:42.447 --> 11:44.852
-Keep going.
-But you have to take
an even amount of steps

11:44.886 --> 11:47.290
because the floor will be bad
and then you tap the doorknob

11:47.324 --> 11:49.862
three times and you do it
all over again.

11:49.896 --> 11:51.198
You know, regular stuff.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.277
-(grunts)
-(indistinct chatter)

11:58.981 --> 12:01.452
Guillermo, now is not time
for shopping.

12:01.485 --> 12:03.256
My wives are hungry.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.961
I know. This is the Uber Eats
order for your 37 wives.

12:05.995 --> 12:07.965
We've narrowed it down
to 32 now.

12:07.999 --> 12:09.802
Well, what did you do
with the rejects?

12:09.836 --> 12:10.971
Guillermo.

12:11.005 --> 12:12.909
Those beautiful, sensitive,

12:12.942 --> 12:15.781
poetic creatures
are not rejects.

12:15.814 --> 12:17.785
They're just simply not
what I'm looking for

12:17.818 --> 12:20.256
-at this particular juncture,
so we got rid of them.
-What?

12:20.290 --> 12:23.329
-I-I don't kill them.
I just make them dead again.
-Yes.

12:23.362 --> 12:25.466
-Isn't that killing them again?
-NANDOR: No.

12:25.501 --> 12:27.939
He re-deads them.
But in a nice way.

12:27.972 --> 12:29.976
And they go to paradise,
don't they?

12:30.009 --> 12:31.412
Sure.

12:31.445 --> 12:33.416
We even came up
with a nice way of doing it.

12:33.449 --> 12:36.422
My sweet Nandor said
I'm supposed to ask you

12:36.455 --> 12:38.459
for a special gold coin?

12:38.493 --> 12:41.065
-(laughs)
-Ah, yes.

12:41.098 --> 12:43.069
Come, come.

12:43.102 --> 12:44.539
NANDOR:
So they never see it coming.

12:44.572 --> 12:46.876
And there is no sadness
or tears.

12:46.910 --> 12:48.112
That sounds like murder.

12:48.145 --> 12:50.183
I'll pretend I didn't hear that.

12:52.253 --> 12:55.093
But, you know,
this isn't just a job to me.

12:55.126 --> 12:57.898
You know, I'm not clocking in
and clocking out.

12:57.932 --> 12:59.969
-This is who I am.
-Right.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.840
And if you don't mind me asking,

13:01.873 --> 13:04.912
who were you before... this?

13:04.946 --> 13:07.518
Well, I was, um...

13:07.551 --> 13:09.421
a...

13:09.454 --> 13:11.392
Well, I...

13:11.425 --> 13:12.862
I can't remember.

13:12.895 --> 13:14.097
You've no idea, have you?

13:14.131 --> 13:15.834
I have no idea.

13:15.868 --> 13:17.370
Well, that is fascinating.

13:17.404 --> 13:18.974
And if you will allow me,

13:19.007 --> 13:20.243
I have a technique

13:20.276 --> 13:22.548
that could retrieve
that lost memory.

13:22.581 --> 13:23.850
Will it hurt?

13:23.884 --> 13:25.286
Maybe.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.894
My dear Roshni, I thought
we'd do a little quiz.

13:28.927 --> 13:31.465
"34 Questions
That Lead to Love."

13:31.499 --> 13:33.169
-(chuckles)
-Question one,

13:33.202 --> 13:36.141
"if you could choose
anyone in the world,

13:36.175 --> 13:39.281
which three people
would you invite to dinner?"

13:39.314 --> 13:41.285
Well, for one,

13:41.318 --> 13:43.222
I would love to hear
the Sufic poetry

13:43.255 --> 13:45.861
of the great poet
Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi

13:45.894 --> 13:47.397
directly from his own lips.

13:47.430 --> 13:49.535
Excellent choice.

13:49.569 --> 13:50.904
And next?

13:50.938 --> 13:52.942
I suppose my dear grandfather.

13:52.975 --> 13:55.446
A simple farmer
but a very wise man.

13:55.480 --> 13:57.317
Very nice, Roshni.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.887
And finally?

13:58.920 --> 14:00.557
-And then perhaps...
-Mm-hmm.

14:00.591 --> 14:01.559
Yes?

14:01.593 --> 14:03.029
...Behrouz the Mighty.

14:03.062 --> 14:05.033
A most fearsome warrior.

14:05.066 --> 14:06.268
A hero.

14:07.404 --> 14:08.974
-Behrouz?
-Yes.

14:09.007 --> 14:10.476
-The Mighty?
-Yes.

14:12.080 --> 14:13.583
Mm.

14:13.617 --> 14:15.253
Hi. Nandor said

14:15.286 --> 14:17.457
-you have a gold coin for me.
-(sighs) Yes,

14:17.490 --> 14:19.161
I do.

14:21.365 --> 14:23.069
(bell tolls)

14:23.102 --> 14:26.041
You're walking down the corridor
of your mind.

14:26.075 --> 14:27.511
Can you picture it?

14:27.545 --> 14:29.314
-Yes.
-Good.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.318
You walk down that corridor

14:31.351 --> 14:33.489
and come across
an important-looking room.

14:33.523 --> 14:36.228
What does it say upon the door?

14:36.261 --> 14:38.265
"Storage."

14:38.299 --> 14:39.267
You open that door.

14:39.301 --> 14:41.071
What do you see inside?

14:41.105 --> 14:43.242
-Boxes.
-Boxes.

14:43.275 --> 14:44.377
-Mm.
-All right.

14:44.411 --> 14:46.983
You open one of the boxes.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.385
What's inside?

14:48.419 --> 14:51.024
Some smaller boxes.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.630
And each one has a label on it.

14:53.663 --> 14:56.068
And what does the label say?

14:56.101 --> 14:59.141
-"Contents: Even Smaller Boxes."
-"S-Smaller Boxes."

14:59.174 --> 15:01.980
Yes, I thought you might say
that. Let's get the fuck out.

15:02.013 --> 15:04.117
-MAN: Is this a bad time?
-I really can't talk right now,
okay?

15:04.151 --> 15:05.654
-All right. Yeah.
-I'll call you back later.

15:05.687 --> 15:07.390
Whenever you can.
I really miss you.

15:07.424 --> 15:08.527
Yeah...

15:08.560 --> 15:10.430
I know what everyone's thinking.

15:10.463 --> 15:12.968
I'm gonna be super jealous
of whoever Nandor's wife

15:13.002 --> 15:14.171
ends up being, but...

15:14.204 --> 15:16.175
I'm really not.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.379
I just want him to be happy.

15:18.412 --> 15:20.116
And...

15:20.149 --> 15:22.120
I'm in a very good place
right now.

15:22.153 --> 15:24.458
As far as that's concerned.

15:24.492 --> 15:26.696
Because...

15:26.729 --> 15:29.234
that's all I will say
about that.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.409
-All right. Special delivery.
-(chattering)

15:33.442 --> 15:35.246
Got some dresses

15:35.279 --> 15:36.983
-and shirts and all the...
-I was going to make Nandor

15:37.016 --> 15:39.321
a shank of lamb--
do you know if he likes lamb?

15:39.354 --> 15:41.593
-Um, I don't think
he's really into lamb, actually.
-DARYA: Hey.

15:41.626 --> 15:43.697
-Can you take this infant away
from me?
-No...

15:43.730 --> 15:45.667
-He is exhausting me.
-Okay,

15:45.701 --> 15:47.203
maybe in a second, Darya.

15:47.237 --> 15:48.540
Kind of have my hands full here,
all right?

15:48.573 --> 15:50.042
Wow. It is so great
to have a nice,

15:50.076 --> 15:51.679
nonthreatening male to talk to.

15:51.713 --> 15:53.149
-Okay.
-DARYA: Isn't it?

15:53.182 --> 15:54.484
What is your name, eunuch?

15:54.519 --> 15:56.088
Well, it's Guillermo,

15:56.121 --> 15:57.490
and I'm not a eunuch, so...

15:57.525 --> 15:59.595
-DARYA: Close enough.
-Cover yourself up.

15:59.629 --> 16:03.537
LASZLO:
Continuing down the corridor
of your mind,

16:03.570 --> 16:06.208
-what do you see?
-Someone needs to clean it up.

16:06.241 --> 16:09.014
All right, apart from that,
do you see a door?

16:09.047 --> 16:12.220
-Many doors.
-Can you tell me what they say?

16:12.253 --> 16:14.291
-"Conversation Starters."
-All right.

16:14.324 --> 16:16.563
Uh, "Favorite Looks Casual."

16:16.596 --> 16:18.232
"Favorite Looks Formal."

16:18.265 --> 16:20.069
"Shame-- Do Not Open."

16:20.102 --> 16:21.438
Uh, "Box Storage Number Two."

16:21.471 --> 16:23.643
That might be
a good one to get into.

16:23.677 --> 16:25.213
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa.
Back up a second.

16:25.246 --> 16:26.716
Did you just say "Shame"?

16:26.749 --> 16:28.185
Let's go in there,
have a bit of a poke around.

16:28.219 --> 16:29.722
-The "Shame" door?
-Please.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.091
Says "Do Not Open."

16:31.124 --> 16:32.360
Well, fuck that.
Just give it a...

16:32.393 --> 16:33.497
give it a hard push.

16:33.530 --> 16:35.166
(grunts)

16:35.199 --> 16:36.335
Nope.

16:36.368 --> 16:38.305
-It's not budging.
-Right. Ah!

16:38.339 --> 16:39.341
What's that I hear?

16:39.374 --> 16:40.476
The footsteps

16:40.511 --> 16:42.313
of somebody strong and powerful

16:42.347 --> 16:45.186
coming down the corridor
of your mind to help you.

16:45.219 --> 16:47.056
Do you see that person?

16:47.090 --> 16:48.693
-Yes.
-Who is he?

16:49.629 --> 16:51.231
It's Guillermo.

16:51.265 --> 16:53.603
No, no, I said
somebody strong and powerful.

16:53.637 --> 16:55.273
Do you see that person?

16:55.306 --> 16:56.609
-Yes, that's Guillermo.
(chuckles)
-Really?

16:56.643 --> 16:58.379
Well, he's naked.

16:58.412 --> 17:00.216
-Hello, Guillermo.
-Uh, just get him
to open the door.

17:00.249 --> 17:02.621
-He's naked.
-Can he open the door?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.224
He's trying,

17:04.257 --> 17:06.596
but his hands keep slipping
off the doorknob

17:06.629 --> 17:09.602
due to the oil
that he used to glisten up

17:09.635 --> 17:11.371
his naked body.

17:11.405 --> 17:14.077
Right. You know what?
I think I might take a break.

17:14.110 --> 17:15.213
(inhales deeply)

17:15.246 --> 17:16.616
DJINN:
Nandor's process

17:16.649 --> 17:18.385
is, uh...

17:18.419 --> 17:19.387
well...

17:19.421 --> 17:22.093
(growling)

17:22.126 --> 17:24.498
You have an impressive
and powerful physique, Kublai.

17:24.532 --> 17:27.270
-(grunts)
-I cannot wait to explore it.

17:27.303 --> 17:30.109
(chuckles)
But I'm afraid...

17:30.142 --> 17:31.646
I am stronger.

17:31.679 --> 17:33.382
-Even a very strong man
like you...
-(growls)

17:33.415 --> 17:35.119
...won't want to step
on that nail.

17:35.152 --> 17:37.123
-Nail? (groans loudly)
-(grunts)

17:37.156 --> 17:38.425
(groans)

17:38.459 --> 17:40.229
Ah!

17:40.263 --> 17:41.766
You win, Kublai.

17:41.799 --> 17:44.437
I may not remember
my beloved's name.

17:44.471 --> 17:48.245
As your prize, you get
a very special gold coin.

17:48.279 --> 17:51.786
But I do remember that
they never beat me at anything.

17:51.819 --> 17:54.124
Fucking Kublai.

17:54.157 --> 17:55.393
Okay, first things first,
I'd say

17:55.426 --> 17:57.263
the two Dalals
are definitely out.

17:57.297 --> 17:59.669
They were humble
and an excellent listener.

17:59.702 --> 18:01.806
My sister, when she was
being courted by her husband...

18:01.839 --> 18:03.877
Well, he didn't end up
actually becoming her husband.

18:03.910 --> 18:06.448
-Mm-hmm.
-We were all certain
they were to be wed, you know?

18:06.481 --> 18:09.722
I'd forgotten how many wonderful
stories you have to tell, Mina.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.191
But he was also, like, a...

18:11.224 --> 18:12.460
NANDOR:
The love of my life

18:12.494 --> 18:13.530
was not petty

18:13.563 --> 18:14.799
or slovenly

18:14.832 --> 18:16.268
or vain.

18:16.301 --> 18:17.403
-Saddle up!
-Or manipulative.

18:17.437 --> 18:19.140
He's a naughty boy.

18:19.174 --> 18:21.646
They never asked me
to shave off my beard.

18:23.482 --> 18:24.619
Okay, she's a maybe.

18:24.652 --> 18:26.355
This guy I don't trust.
This one

18:26.388 --> 18:28.192
never learned to read.
I like her,

18:28.225 --> 18:30.564
but she's so much smarter
than me, so...

18:30.597 --> 18:31.833
see ya!

18:32.968 --> 18:35.741
They were warm
and wanted to be with me.

18:35.774 --> 18:37.845
You know, Behrouz the Mighty,

18:37.878 --> 18:40.617
all of his fearsome shit
was actually done by other guys.

18:40.651 --> 18:42.621
My heart's desire was kind

18:42.655 --> 18:44.457
and a good haggler.

18:44.492 --> 18:46.696
They never borrowed my boots
without asking me.

18:46.729 --> 18:49.301
They were merciful.

18:49.334 --> 18:50.436
And horny.

18:50.469 --> 18:53.442
And this, my dear Ramy,

18:53.475 --> 18:55.580
is where the magic happens.

18:55.614 --> 18:56.883
Shall we?

18:56.916 --> 18:59.254
Could I get one
of those gold coins now?

18:59.287 --> 19:02.193
My beloved had a sense
of spontaneity and fun.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.732
-(chuckling)
-(giggles)
Nandor, what are you hiding?

19:04.765 --> 19:06.502
-Ah!

19:06.536 --> 19:09.207
H-Hey! No, wait! Come back!

19:09.240 --> 19:10.911
-Where you going?!
-No.

19:10.944 --> 19:11.913
Come back!

19:11.946 --> 19:13.415
It's just a lobster!

19:13.449 --> 19:14.752

Why are you so grumpy
these days, Guillermo?

19:55.266 --> 19:57.236
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe 'cause I'm exhausted

19:57.270 --> 19:59.441
from feeding and taking care

I haven't slept in weeks.

20:19.314 --> 20:21.586
-Colin, give me the hammer.
-Hey! Shit.

20:21.619 --> 20:23.690
Do you know that I've missed
my mother's birthday party

20:23.723 --> 20:24.692
three years in a row?

20:24.725 --> 20:26.395
No. Why would I know that?

20:26.428 --> 20:28.399
I would have to know that
it was your mother's birthday

20:28.432 --> 20:29.869
and also the things you do.

20:29.902 --> 20:31.405
I-I really am glad
that you want to find a wife,

20:31.438 --> 20:33.442
and I think it's cool.
I really do.

20:33.475 --> 20:34.712
-I'm cool with that.
-Oh, good.

20:34.745 --> 20:36.481
I'm so glad
you are "cool" with that.

20:36.516 --> 20:38.485
But I already have a family.
And one that I don't see

20:38.520 --> 20:40.423
because I spend so much time
taking care of you guys,

20:40.456 --> 20:41.692
I don't take care of myself.

20:41.726 --> 20:43.863
I think he has fallen asleep.

20:43.897 --> 20:45.466
I think your story bored him.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.403
(snickering)

20:48.405 --> 20:49.809
Only kidding, Guillermo.

20:50.777 --> 20:52.346
Eesh.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.650
We've had a breakthrough.

20:53.683 --> 20:55.987
This job isn't my job.

20:56.021 --> 20:57.758
It's my punishment.

20:57.791 --> 21:00.697
She'd locked away her most
shameful and sordid memories

21:00.730 --> 21:02.634
for so long
that she'd forgotten them.

21:02.668 --> 21:04.972
-I was a bad vampire.
-Yes.

21:05.005 --> 21:06.642
GUIDE:
I was sloppy.

21:06.676 --> 21:08.011
I was wild.

21:08.045 --> 21:10.917
I was a moth
to the danger flame.

21:10.951 --> 21:12.754
I led the Inquisition.

21:12.788 --> 21:15.326
I danced
the Dance of the Seven Veils.

21:15.359 --> 21:16.662
(whispers):
Without the veils.

21:16.696 --> 21:17.898
LASZLO:
Top work.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.635
GUIDE:
I was, simply put,

21:19.668 --> 21:21.739
-extra.
-It's true.

21:21.772 --> 21:24.410
And we finally got
to the bottom of the, uh,

21:24.444 --> 21:26.616
naked, glistening Guillermo
business

21:26.649 --> 21:28.853
that's been lurking
in her tawdry mind.

21:30.389 --> 21:31.893
Don't stop.
This is getting good.

21:31.926 --> 21:34.464
The final straw came,

21:34.498 --> 21:37.771
the ultimate messiness
for a vampire...

21:37.805 --> 21:41.011
(sighs) when I slept
with a vampire killer.

21:41.044 --> 21:42.380
Shit.

21:42.413 --> 21:43.482
No.

21:43.516 --> 21:44.618
A Van Helsing.

21:44.652 --> 21:45.620
No.

21:45.654 --> 21:46.656
Yeah.

21:46.689 --> 21:48.560
I knew it was wrong

21:48.593 --> 21:49.895
when I did it.

21:49.929 --> 21:51.666
There's something
about his kind--

21:51.699 --> 21:54.370
the danger, the depravity.

21:54.404 --> 21:56.909
Will this climax be
the end of my story?

21:56.943 --> 21:58.646
And what a way to go.

21:58.680 --> 22:01.586
His fingers
that could wrap around my neck.

22:01.619 --> 22:04.123
All right. Leave this with me.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.027
(whispering):
What? Are you fucking insane?

22:06.061 --> 22:08.098
No. No way.

22:08.131 --> 22:09.768
It's every young boy's fantasy.

22:09.802 --> 22:11.371
What's wrong with you?
It works, doesn't it?

22:11.404 --> 22:12.941
-As if you could do any better.
-Just do it.

22:12.975 --> 22:14.945
Get her to stop talking
about that fucking building.

22:14.979 --> 22:17.584
She clearly has a weakness
for your kind.

22:17.618 --> 22:18.786
She might teach you
a thing or two.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.456
Okay.

22:20.489 --> 22:22.794
If I do this,
what's it worth to you?

22:22.828 --> 22:24.030
Name your price.

22:24.999 --> 22:26.602
I want to be
the nightclub's accountant.

22:26.636 --> 22:28.405
LASZLO:
Why?

22:28.438 --> 22:29.542
Why not?

22:29.575 --> 22:31.679
This makes me suspicious
a little.

22:32.848 --> 22:34.484
Well, do you want my help
or not?

22:34.518 --> 22:36.956
Eh. I mean, we do, so...

22:36.989 --> 22:38.860
-done deal.
-Okay. Well.

22:38.893 --> 22:41.699
Yeah, I've done a lot of things
for Nandor, Laszlo and Nadja

22:41.732 --> 22:43.068
over the years, but...

22:43.101 --> 22:44.605
seducing a vampire
to do their bidding?

22:44.638 --> 22:46.408
(exhales)

22:46.441 --> 22:47.443
That's a new one.

22:47.476 --> 22:50.082
(creaking)

22:50.115 --> 22:52.621
Guillermo,
I know why you're here.

22:52.654 --> 22:55.827
But the answer is no.

22:55.860 --> 22:57.564
Oh, come on.
(chuckles softly)

22:57.598 --> 22:59.100
Don't-don't you think
a nightclub would be...

22:59.133 --> 23:01.606
a nice, fun change of pace
for you?

23:01.639 --> 23:03.610
Yeah, sure.
The nightclub's fine.

23:03.643 --> 23:05.045
I don't care about that anymore.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.849
-Okay, good. (chuckles)
-Yeah.

23:06.882 --> 23:08.118
No, it is our...

23:08.151 --> 23:09.989
-forbidden love...
-(gasps)

23:10.022 --> 23:12.995
...that I must squash before
it has a chance to blossom.

23:13.028 --> 23:14.865
Yes.

23:14.899 --> 23:15.967
Yeah. All right, well,

23:16.001 --> 23:18.438
nice doing business with you.

23:18.472 --> 23:19.440
I'm gonna go.

23:19.474 --> 23:20.944
(gasps)

23:21.879 --> 23:25.620
We felt a passion for each other
from the moment we met, no?

23:25.654 --> 23:28.793
Oops! I should have known
you had Van Helsing blood in you

23:28.826 --> 23:32.466
when I felt that tingling
in my most private of parts.

23:32.501 --> 23:33.736
Great. I'm gonna...

23:33.770 --> 23:35.607
-Ooh! Ooh!
-Oh.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.613
Oh, my sweet, sweet Guillermo.

23:38.646 --> 23:40.550
My attraction to you

23:40.583 --> 23:43.221
is a manifestation
of a longing for my past life,

23:43.255 --> 23:46.461
when I was a naughty,
dirty vampire.

23:46.495 --> 23:48.533
(cackles)

23:48.566 --> 23:50.670
But that's not who I am anymore.

23:50.704 --> 23:52.608
-(grunts, pants)
-Please tell me you understand.

23:52.641 --> 23:54.745
-No hard feelings.
-Okay.

23:54.778 --> 23:55.947
Now I'm gonna go,

23:55.981 --> 23:57.618
-and you're gonna stay.
-Bye-bye.

23:57.651 --> 24:00.557
Guillermo, can you find it
in your heart

24:00.590 --> 24:03.596
to be just... friends with me?

24:05.834 --> 24:07.036
Sure.

24:07.069 --> 24:08.573
I could use a friend.
(chuckles)

24:08.606 --> 24:09.975
High five.
(gasps)

24:10.009 --> 24:12.781
All right. Then what are
we waiting for, huh?!

24:12.814 --> 24:14.518
-(chuckles) It's a good day.
-Where'd she get that from?

24:14.551 --> 24:16.087
Let's get this old shit
out of here

24:16.121 --> 24:18.058
and make a vampire nightclub!

24:18.091 --> 24:19.495
-GUILLERMO: What are you gonna
do with the hammer?
-(whoops)

24:20.563 --> 24:21.565
Yeah!

24:21.599 --> 24:23.636
(cackles)

24:23.670 --> 24:25.573
As you can see,
another patient cured

24:25.607 --> 24:27.778
and returned
to perfect mental health.

24:27.811 --> 24:30.784
Yes, she seems very well now,
doesn't she?

24:30.817 --> 24:33.923
-No charge.
-(cackling)

24:33.956 --> 24:35.192
Well done, my love.

24:35.225 --> 24:36.261
Indeed.

24:36.294 --> 24:37.831
She's gone.

24:37.864 --> 24:39.133
What are we left with?

24:39.167 --> 24:41.204
I have found the one.

24:41.237 --> 24:43.943
We are engaged to be wed.

24:43.976 --> 24:46.081
This is Marwa.

24:46.114 --> 24:48.553
Hello. I am Marwa of Al Qolni...

24:48.586 --> 24:49.955
I mean, it was obvious
all along.

24:49.988 --> 24:51.959
You know, like, duh.

24:51.993 --> 24:53.663
Would you excuse me
for one moment,

24:53.696 --> 24:54.698
please, my little pomegranate?

24:54.732 --> 24:55.967
Be right back.

24:56.001 --> 24:57.804
(clears throat)

24:57.838 --> 24:59.240
I was lucky enough to have
the best education...

24:59.273 --> 25:02.547
I always imagined my wife
with blonde hair.

25:02.581 --> 25:05.687
...but my passion lied
in science and mathematics...

25:05.720 --> 25:08.726
I think I was thinking
a little less platinum blonde,

25:08.760 --> 25:10.730
little more, um, hint of red.

25:10.764 --> 25:13.101
I am most proud
that my observations

25:13.135 --> 25:14.972
-of Jupiter and Saturn...
-Hmm.

25:15.005 --> 25:16.307
You know what? I think

25:16.341 --> 25:18.579
I prefer it just as it was
in the beginning.

25:18.613 --> 25:20.015
Using up a lot of wishes.

25:20.049 --> 25:22.019
Yes, I know, but let's do it.

25:22.053 --> 25:24.958
Nothing is too good
for my perfect wife.

25:25.927 --> 25:29.635
I am very lucky to have a man
of such intellect

25:29.668 --> 25:31.104
to share my life with.

25:31.137 --> 25:32.106
