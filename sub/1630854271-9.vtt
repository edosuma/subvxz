take a lot of confidence

for me to just
overcome the nerves.

from Miami --

00:39.998 --> 00:42.709
Orlando Mendez!
Yeah!

00:42.751 --> 00:44.586
Orlando: A lot on the line,
for sure.

00:44.627 --> 00:46.880
This is finally a reality,
and this is everything

00:46.921 --> 00:48.048
I've ever worked for.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.549
That's country,

the one going home.

00:54.346 --> 00:56.306
Charlie:
I love everyone here.

00:56.348 --> 00:59.184
Here, it's just about
the live performance

00:59.225 --> 01:01.394
and being yourself
and being open.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.188
I think that if you get
too technical,

01:03.229 --> 01:05.982
then you can be, like, so rigid
by the time you're onstage,

01:06.024 --> 01:07.400
you're like, "Ah! Unh!"
Yeah.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.194
And then you're like, "What?
I didn't even have fun."

01:09.235 --> 01:10.653
And that's the worst feeling.

01:10.695 --> 01:12.238
Team Camila is all about
having fun.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.698
I totally agree.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.992
Okay, so up next,
we have Orlando and Ava Lynn.

01:16.034 --> 01:17.827
I was gonna say
they're some of my favorites,

01:17.869 --> 01:19.245
but, like, literally,
all of them are.

01:19.287 --> 01:20.455
Right.
You're gonna be obsessed.

01:20.497 --> 01:21.915
I know
I'm gonna be obsessed.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.500
You're gonna be obsessed.
Because it's Team Camila.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.085
They're the best.
Why wouldn't I be obsessed?

Charlie Puth was, like, unreal.

01:32.467 --> 01:33.802
I mean, a voice from the gods,

01:33.843 --> 01:35.387
has worked with
the biggest names,

01:35.428 --> 01:37.430
and he has perfect pitch.

How are you guys feeling?
Are you excited?

01:39.557 --> 01:41.226
I'm hype that I got Ava.
Ava Lynn: Yeah.

01:41.267 --> 01:42.686
We were just saying that.
Like, coming in,

01:42.727 --> 01:44.896
I was like, I'm so glad I have,
like, someone, you know?

01:44.938 --> 01:46.231
Like a buddy? I know.
Yeah.

01:46.272 --> 01:47.440
First time you come out here,
you're all alone.

01:47.482 --> 01:49.025
It's, like, so scary.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.528
Backstage before my auditions,
I was really freaking out.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.780
* Hit me, baby,
one more time *

01:53.822 --> 01:57.117
Just graduated high school,
and I would have never thought

01:57.158 --> 01:59.202
that I would be on that stage

01:59.244 --> 02:00.954
performing for
hundreds of people.

02:00.995 --> 02:05.125
Back home, I was playing music
in these super tiny dive bars,

02:05.166 --> 02:08.378
so I don't have
a lot of experience.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.588
But that's what's so crazy
about this process.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.465
I'll have to go with Camila.
Yeah, baby!

02:12.507 --> 02:17.137
Camila gives me the confidence
to really explore

02:17.178 --> 02:18.763
everything in my artistry.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.516
She really is
that supportive coach.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.560
Alright.
Let's get to work!

02:23.601 --> 02:25.562
Okay.
Do you like this song?

02:25.603 --> 02:26.938
It's "Rocket Man"
by Elton John.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.024
This was the first song
I ever heard of Elton John

02:29.065 --> 02:30.275
when I was a kid.
Really?

02:30.316 --> 02:32.402
That new remix
with Dua Lipa, you know?

02:32.444 --> 02:34.988
Oh, it's so good, right?
You know he's my neighbor?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.322
No!
Yes.

02:36.364 --> 02:38.033
He played me that version
of that song

02:38.074 --> 02:39.451
a day before it came out.

02:39.492 --> 02:42.620
I'm like, "Well, that's
a massive, massive record."

02:42.662 --> 02:46.499
Ava and Orlando, they are both
my cool, like, country singers.

02:46.541 --> 02:48.418
* She packed my bags
last night *

02:48.460 --> 02:49.669
* Pre-flight *
So I wanted

02:49.711 --> 02:51.338
an out-of-the-box
song choice for them.

02:51.379 --> 02:52.672
So I found
a country version

02:52.714 --> 02:54.382
of "Rocket Man"
by Elton John.

02:54.424 --> 02:58.720
* And I'm gonna be high *
Yeah!

02:58.762 --> 03:01.014
Orlando:
This is a legendary song.

03:01.056 --> 03:02.682
A tall, tall order,
for sure.

03:02.724 --> 03:06.478
I remember being captured
by the lyrics in middle school.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.397
For me, this song also
really connects to my roots.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.025
My grandparents were forced
to flee Cuba,

03:12.067 --> 03:14.361
forced out into that unknown.

03:14.402 --> 03:15.695
It's like being a rocket man.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.572
The sacrifices they made for me,

03:17.614 --> 03:19.115
I wouldn't be here
without them.

03:19.157 --> 03:21.493
[ Whooshing ]
Whoo!

03:21.534 --> 03:23.661
I think my grandparents
would be in shambles

03:23.703 --> 03:25.914
if they saw I turned four chairs
at the blind audition.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.415
* I'm a rocket man *

03:27.457 --> 03:30.293
Charlie: Orlando's voice
was very unique and powerful.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.212
He has a lot of colors
in his voice,

03:32.253 --> 03:33.546
and that's what I'm looking for

03:33.588 --> 03:35.131
when I'm producing a record
for somebody.

03:35.173 --> 03:40.261
* On such a timeless
flight *

03:40.303 --> 03:41.471
Yes!

03:41.513 --> 03:43.473
Ava Lynn had
incredible control

03:43.515 --> 03:44.933
in the tonality of her voice --

03:44.974 --> 03:46.685
almost reminded me
a little bit of Taylor Swift.

03:46.726 --> 03:49.104
Together: * And I think
it's gonna be a long *

03:49.145 --> 03:52.899
I was getting definite little
goose bumps when she sang.

03:52.941 --> 03:54.984
* Tiiiiime *

03:55.026 --> 03:57.529
Camila: Yeah!

03:57.570 --> 03:59.698
Fire!
Wow. Two powerhouses.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.408
You have it
in the low range,

04:01.449 --> 04:03.827
and you have it
in the extremely high range.

the most?

kind of, like --

04:12.335 --> 04:13.753
I like to look
down a lot.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.172
You don't want to look down.
You want to look confident.

to you right now."

04:18.800 --> 04:20.093
That's actually
very true.

04:20.135 --> 04:21.678
I'll make eye contact
towards one person

04:21.720 --> 04:23.471
that's really
giving me energy back.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.433
Yep.
It's important
to have some kind of

04:26.474 --> 04:31.688
emotional intention
that's stronger than the nerves.

not looking here.

that I make eye contact with.

isn't going away.

as much air.

at the end.

05:02.177 --> 05:04.012
One practical advice --

05:04.054 --> 05:07.098
singing this song
on the treadmill.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.558
Okay.
Not a bad idea.

05:08.600 --> 05:11.644
Doing like a fast-paced walk
and taking deep breaths

05:11.686 --> 05:13.146
and trying to hold out
the notes

05:13.188 --> 05:15.231
a little bit longer
than you would.
Right.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.984
In that situation, you have
no choice but to breathe.

05:18.026 --> 05:20.653

on the treadmill, sing the song,

05:20.695 --> 05:22.155
and then once you come
to the stage,

05:22.197 --> 05:23.615
it'll be, like, no problem.

of this before?

I would try to keep it

a little bit more close
to the original melody.

17:00.437 --> 17:02.814

what you're doing.

17:07.318 --> 17:09.237
So, right then,
they're already mad at you.

17:09.279 --> 17:10.822
So if you can just give them
what they want,

17:10.864 --> 17:12.574
which is the melody,
they'll be like...
Yep.

that thought goes away,

17:18.038 --> 17:19.205
you're on the second verse

17:19.247 --> 17:20.498
and then you show them
what you got.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.083
You know
what I'm saying?
Okay.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.752

nostalgic song.

17:23.793 --> 17:27.922

for that person to be near you.

of falling in love in college.

of a decade

with another person,

it was really traumatic.

it's just very...

Both of you couldn't be
more different as artists.

I was gonna ask her if she's
been in Gwen's closet,

very loose and very energetic

to that more,

go with Emma.

more polished.

were super impressive.

really easy for her."

you're just
so exciting to watch.

you're 19 years old.

give us a few thoughts

39:25.115 --> 39:26.658
before you tell us
the final decision.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.451
Both of you are so good
at what you do,

from each other.

You know, I felt like
it was a little closer

39:32.080 --> 39:34.958
to Nia's wheelhouse,
just kind of stylistically.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.668
My only concern
during rehearsals

39:36.710 --> 39:38.420
with you, Nia,
was vocally,

39:38.461 --> 39:41.339
sometimes it's -- it's
hard for -- for you
to compare with Emma.

39:41.381 --> 39:44.467
But I really thought
this was your best
vocal performance, too.

39:44.509 --> 39:46.678
Compared to the blinds
and rehearsals,

39:46.720 --> 39:48.763
you were just really
on point vocally,

39:48.805 --> 39:51.516
and then you gave such
great energy to the audience.

39:51.558 --> 39:55.228
And, Emma, you can do anything.
You're really a good vocalist.

39:55.270 --> 39:57.856
And one of the things
we talked about with Jazmine

39:57.897 --> 40:01.818
was you can sell the story
in your eyes and in your face.

40:01.860 --> 40:03.903

that Gwen noticed that.

what Emma's gonna do

but not when you have,
like, the family I do.

44:46.102 --> 44:48.396
I really love living
with those guys.

44:48.438 --> 44:51.232
My sister and I have always
been so close.

44:51.274 --> 44:53.068
Growing up,
we did everything together.

44:53.109 --> 44:54.819
As we've gotten older,
we've really been

44:54.861 --> 44:56.112
each other's best friends.

44:56.154 --> 44:57.655
And so, I've got it made
at home.

44:57.697 --> 45:00.200
But if this opportunity
at "The Voice" takes me

45:00.241 --> 45:02.577
somewhere else,
I'm ready to take it on.

45:02.619 --> 45:06.247
Bodie, what do you think about
doing a Justin Bieber song?

45:06.289 --> 45:07.916
I was like, "What?"
[ Laughs ]

45:07.957 --> 45:11.086
Blake gave us Justin Bieber's
hit "As Long As You Love Me."

45:11.127 --> 45:12.295
I knew it was gonna
pose a challenge

45:12.337 --> 45:13.588
just on the arrangement side.

45:13.630 --> 45:15.423
So many times,
something crazy

45:15.465 --> 45:17.676
comes out of these things
that you just never expect.

45:17.717 --> 45:20.887
It's always a-a quick,
sharp learning curve,

45:20.929 --> 45:22.263
especially if
it's a challenge

45:22.305 --> 45:23.598
trying to figure out
how to make it work

45:23.640 --> 45:25.558
for who you are
as an artist or whatever.

45:25.600 --> 45:27.936
We went into this thinking,
how could we make it sound

45:27.977 --> 45:29.270
like something we wrote?

45:29.312 --> 45:31.189
Like, make it sound
good today.
Yeah.

45:31.231 --> 45:32.649
Kind of like when I sing
Blake Shelton songs.

45:32.691 --> 45:34.234
I make them sound
good today.
Right, right.

45:34.275 --> 45:36.444
Yeah.
Making them
sound good, period.

45:36.486 --> 45:38.238
Making them sound how they were
supposed to sound.

45:38.279 --> 45:39.614
Yeah, right.
Yeah.

45:39.656 --> 45:43.201
Bodie: I tend to sing
more pop, R&B, soul.

45:43.243 --> 45:45.954
This song, it's a big
dubstep-y kind of vibe.

45:45.995 --> 45:47.455
It has a rap feature on it.

45:47.497 --> 45:49.249
And so I was kind of racking
my brain on how the heck

45:49.290 --> 45:50.625
am I gonna do this?

45:50.667 --> 45:54.045
* Take my chances *
Whoa!

45:54.087 --> 45:56.423
Together:
* As long as you love me *
But we rearranged the song.

45:56.464 --> 45:58.216
Just kept it real stripped
and real chill.

45:58.258 --> 46:01.136
And I'm feeling
really comfortable now.

46:01.177 --> 46:03.388
Growing up in a family
of performers,

46:03.430 --> 46:06.307
always kind of just gravitated
towards the stage

46:06.349 --> 46:09.310
and just fell in love with
singing, learning instruments.

46:09.352 --> 46:13.064
I got my ukulele.
I was probably 7 or 8.

46:13.106 --> 46:15.483
Went to guitar and clarinet,
piano, drums.

46:15.525 --> 46:16.943
It kind of all trickled in.

46:16.985 --> 46:20.155
And now I teach at my alma mater
in the music department.

46:20.196 --> 46:22.032
It's just crazy to think
that I'm here.

46:22.073 --> 46:23.324
I'm just hoping
to come out on top

46:23.366 --> 46:24.993
and make sure I can get
to the knockouts,

46:25.035 --> 46:26.327
where now the stakes
are higher.

46:26.369 --> 46:28.329
This season,
it's a three-way competition,

46:28.371 --> 46:30.415
so I got to be more focused
than ever,

46:30.457 --> 46:31.833
ready to put down the work.

46:31.875 --> 46:33.877
* We're under pressure *

46:33.918 --> 46:37.797
* 7 billion people in the world
trying to fit in *

46:37.839 --> 46:41.176
Jaeden is the surprise for me
in this battle.

46:41.217 --> 46:44.846
He's got this whispery tone
that he sings with.

46:44.888 --> 46:46.556
It's almost like a -- a lullaby.

46:46.598 --> 46:49.017
Bodie: * As long as you love me,
I'll be your platinum *

46:49.059 --> 46:51.353
Bodie's voice
is very powerful.

46:51.394 --> 46:52.771
There's something
very intense

46:52.812 --> 46:56.066
about his performances,
and it's very endearing.

46:56.107 --> 46:57.776
[ Both vocalizing ]
Yeah!

46:57.817 --> 47:00.862
Bodie and Jaeden really
complemented each other well.

47:00.904 --> 47:02.238
The way they arranged that,

47:02.280 --> 47:03.907
that's some like
Grammy performance,

47:03.948 --> 47:07.202
next-level, new artist of
the year type stuff, though.

47:07.243 --> 47:09.287
Why would Blake
put them together?

47:09.329 --> 47:11.331
Blake, what are you doing, bro?

47:11.373 --> 47:13.416
Why would you
do that to yourself?

47:13.458 --> 47:14.626
Whoo!

47:14.668 --> 47:16.544
Geez!
Wow.

47:16.586 --> 47:18.713
Wow. Wow.
That's so good, you guys.

47:18.755 --> 47:20.340
It sounded like a completely
different song.

47:20.382 --> 47:22.384
I was like --
Man, like, whew.

47:22.425 --> 47:24.552
And he's a Belieber, too.
[ Laughter ]

47:24.594 --> 47:26.054
And your voices
are so different,

47:26.096 --> 47:28.556
but it meshes,
know what I mean?
Yeah, yes.

47:28.598 --> 47:30.725
It's really magical,
you guys together.

47:30.767 --> 47:33.812
The way you entered in the song
is probably your sweet spot.

47:33.853 --> 47:36.564
Your voice in that whisper mode
is so good.

47:36.606 --> 47:39.359
You're really the one that sets
the tone, the vibe.

47:39.401 --> 47:42.195
And I feel like you had
the bigger challenge of trying

47:42.237 --> 47:45.323
to figure out how to fit
yourself into this thing.
Big-time.

47:45.365 --> 47:46.783
Sometimes
when people come in,

47:46.825 --> 47:48.702
they don't know what to do
with one hand, but luckily,

47:48.743 --> 47:50.745
if you're holding a mic,
that's got that take care of.

47:50.787 --> 47:52.706
I usually play guitar too, so
I'm trying to figure that out.

47:52.747 --> 47:54.457
You were playing
in blinds, right?
Yeah. Yeah.

47:54.499 --> 47:56.876
Jaeden, when you get
to the higher stuff

47:56.918 --> 48:00.088
and you're using your falsetto,
you've got to figure out a way

48:00.130 --> 48:02.215
to get to the pitch
just a little quicker.
Jaeden: Sure.

48:02.257 --> 48:05.301
Because there's one note that
you spent a long time bending.

48:05.343 --> 48:08.763
Yeah.
It kind of didn't fit
with what you guys had created

48:08.805 --> 48:11.349
because it was
such a blue note.

48:11.391 --> 48:14.144
* I'll be your silver
and I'll be your *

48:14.185 --> 48:18.440
Together:
* Goooooooold *

48:18.481 --> 48:19.899
Blake:
Bodie and Jaeden are

48:19.941 --> 48:22.944
my two most unique artists
on my team this year.

48:22.986 --> 48:25.822
And I really don't know who
in the world you could compare

48:25.864 --> 48:27.323
either one of them to.

48:27.365 --> 48:30.827
I love odd things like this,
and 9 times out of 10,

48:30.869 --> 48:33.455
it creates something
really cool, and it did today.

48:33.496 --> 48:37.751
Together:
* I'll be your gold *

48:37.792 --> 48:39.002
Whoo! Do that.

48:39.044 --> 48:40.712
Oh, my God!

48:40.754 --> 48:42.756
That song needs
to be recorded.
We should, we should.

48:42.797 --> 48:44.299
If y'all need somebody
to produce it,

48:44.341 --> 48:45.967
let me know.
I got ideas.

48:46.009 --> 48:47.427
Y'all should just quit
"The Voice" right now,

48:47.469 --> 48:48.762
let Jimmie make
an album on you.

48:48.803 --> 48:50.638
Yeah, let's get it done.
And get out on the road.

48:50.680 --> 48:52.265
I don't know what
you're gonna do.

48:52.307 --> 48:55.435
The only person who's gonna be
having a bad day is me that day.

48:55.477 --> 48:57.687
These two came in
giving it their all.

48:57.729 --> 48:59.647
That's gonna get
Bieber's attention.

48:59.689 --> 49:01.066
Yeah, it is.

49:01.107 --> 49:03.401
It's gonna be a tough decision
for me in this battle.

49:03.443 --> 49:08.782
That jawn's fire!
I might put that in my set.

49:08.823 --> 49:10.575
[ Laughter ]

is so beautiful.

Bodie, you were even better
than I remember

53:02.140 --> 53:03.141
in your blind.
Wow.

Your runs were crazy.

were masterful.

right now.

Oh, my God,
this is so hard."

what Camila thinks.
Right. I know.

It's like, "What will I do
without knowing that?"

I know. "I respect her so much,
like, her opinion

is so amazing."
"I respect her so much."

I would steal both of you.

really special and cool.

I did that.

of your guys's, like,

depth as artists.

is gorgeous.

So much range, power,
tenderness.

to hear in a vocal.

53:50.855 --> 53:52.899
You got a four-chair turn and
we all were fighting for you.

53:52.941 --> 53:54.317
But this is,
like, next level

53:54.359 --> 53:56.069
than what I thought you were.
Wow, thank you.

53:56.111 --> 53:57.779
Jaeden, what I love
about you,

53:57.821 --> 53:59.614
besides just your voice,
is you.

53:59.656 --> 54:01.700
Even though Bodie
was killing it,

54:01.741 --> 54:03.827
I was staring at you, like,
most of the time

54:03.868 --> 54:05.578
because you're just so --
Watch it.

54:05.620 --> 54:07.664
[ Laughs ]
I'm joking.

54:07.706 --> 54:09.416
Hey, I'm married, okay?

54:09.457 --> 54:10.917
He's right here.

54:10.959 --> 54:14.546
I'm here.
[ Laughter ]

54:14.587 --> 54:15.922
But I do really
love your voice.

54:15.964 --> 54:18.842
I love your tone.
Listen, this is a tough one.

54:18.883 --> 54:20.510
Yeah, I know that.

54:20.552 --> 54:22.220
Good job, Blake.

54:22.262 --> 54:24.848
Well, I really
loved it, too.

54:24.889 --> 54:26.850
Jaeden, if I were to pick
between the tones

54:26.891 --> 54:28.143
that I would listen to,

54:28.184 --> 54:29.978
I think I would pick yours
a little bit more.

54:30.020 --> 54:32.856
It's got character
and grit and depth

54:32.897 --> 54:34.524
and that haunting,
kind of floaty vibe

54:34.566 --> 54:35.734
at the same time.

54:35.775 --> 54:36.943
You're like Superman.

54:36.985 --> 54:38.445
You can do anything
with that voice.

54:38.486 --> 54:40.447
But sometimes
your execution

54:40.488 --> 54:42.699
isn't always
all the way there.

54:42.741 --> 54:45.785
Bodie, though, your voice
is so strong and powerful,

54:45.827 --> 54:48.371
and it's got character
and presence.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.373
I thought your execution
was perfect,

54:50.415 --> 54:51.875
so I would pick Bodie.

54:51.916 --> 54:54.627
But I really do believe
Jaeden has so much potential.

54:54.669 --> 54:56.379
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.

54:56.421 --> 54:58.131
Alright, Blake, you got
the final decision.

54:58.173 --> 54:59.883
Before we find out the winner,
give us your thoughts.

54:59.924 --> 55:03.011
Jaeden, I didn't expect you
to step up and have that.

55:03.053 --> 55:05.388
It's almost like that
Chris Isaak "Wicked Game"...

55:05.430 --> 55:06.931
Yeah.
...type thing...

55:06.973 --> 55:08.433
Mm-hmm.
...about your approach
to this song,

55:08.475 --> 55:11.895
and, like, the girls
are just freaking out over it.

55:11.936 --> 55:13.605
[ Shrieks ]
You know what I mean? It's --

55:13.646 --> 55:15.315
Hey!
It really is cool.

55:15.357 --> 55:16.566
You need
to teach me that.

55:16.608 --> 55:17.901
[ Laughter ]

55:17.942 --> 55:20.111
Bodie, instead of going down
the falsetto road,

55:20.153 --> 55:21.738
he goes full voice,
you know,

55:21.780 --> 55:23.281
and hits it with
all the power and stuff,

55:23.323 --> 55:25.450
and it's really
impressive, dude.

55:25.492 --> 55:26.910
Your voice is crazy,

55:26.951 --> 55:29.829
and you found a way
to make it work together,

55:29.871 --> 55:32.332
and everybody's
super excited about it.

55:32.374 --> 55:34.417
[ Shrieks ]
So...

55:34.459 --> 55:36.294
[ Laughs ] Oh, gosh.

55:36.336 --> 55:37.754
Daly: Blake,

55:37.796 --> 55:38.963
the time has come, buddy.

55:39.005 --> 55:41.049
Who is the winner
of this battle?

55:41.091 --> 55:42.467
Oh.

55:42.509 --> 55:48.306
You're both so unique,
but the winner of this battle

55:48.348 --> 55:50.809
is Bodie.
Bodie, congratulations.

55:50.850 --> 55:52.394
You're moving on
to the knockouts,

55:52.435 --> 55:53.770
representing Team Blake.

55:53.812 --> 55:55.355
Come on, Bodie!
Yes!

55:55.397 --> 55:56.606
I ended up choosing Bodie,

55:56.648 --> 55:57.816
because he's a very
unique artist.

55:57.857 --> 55:59.317
He's got a really
cool tone.

55:59.359 --> 56:00.735
You sounded great, man,
seriously.

56:00.777 --> 56:02.112
Thank you.
Yes, sir.

56:02.153 --> 56:04.239
I still haven't
put my finger on what it is

56:04.280 --> 56:05.365
that he wants to do,

56:05.407 --> 56:07.325
but I want to be
on that journey with him.

56:07.367 --> 56:09.994
Coaches, a reminder that Jaeden
is available to steal or save.

56:10.036 --> 56:13.123
[ Whoosh ]
That is the sound

56:13.164 --> 56:15.750
of a steal times two!
Two times.

56:15.792 --> 56:20.380
Yes!
Both Camila and Gwen
used their one-and-only steals

56:20.422 --> 56:22.382
for Jaeden.

56:22.424 --> 56:24.968
Jaeden, you know
we have something special.

56:25.010 --> 56:26.761
Oh.
[ Laughter ]

56:26.803 --> 56:27.971
The moment --
That's not fair!

56:28.013 --> 56:29.556
From the moment
we met,

56:29.597 --> 56:30.849
my chair
was turned around,

56:30.890 --> 56:32.851
and I was looking
at the back of the room,

56:32.892 --> 56:35.186
but there was an energy
in the air.

56:35.228 --> 56:37.313
But in all seriousness,
I think that your voice

56:37.355 --> 56:39.357
is really special,
and I think it would be

56:39.399 --> 56:41.985
interesting to see
what we could do together.

56:42.027 --> 56:44.779
I like kind of
left-of-center people like you.

56:44.821 --> 56:47.157
Thank you.
And also, if not,
I will break up with you.

Daly: Alright.

56:51.494 --> 56:54.372
Gwen, why did you use your
one-and-only steal on Jaeden?

56:54.414 --> 56:56.624
Gwen: First of all,
your blind performance,

56:56.666 --> 56:57.834
you did do a Bread song,

56:57.876 --> 56:59.377
which is one
of my favorite groups.

56:59.419 --> 57:01.463
Well, I love bread.
I eat a lot of bread.

type of bread.

You guys do have
a lot of chemistry,

57:08.845 --> 57:10.638
and I-I don't want to get
in the way of that.

57:10.680 --> 57:14.517
But I have been around
for a long time.

57:14.559 --> 57:16.019
I have a lot to offer.

57:16.061 --> 57:18.772
I'm a super fan of your style
of singing, your voice,

57:18.813 --> 57:21.274

to be your coach.

who's it gonna be?

He's somebody that has this,
like, raw talent.

He was a good boyfriend

with him if he picked Gwen.

didn't stand a chance.

1:01:38.531 --> 1:01:41.242
'cause I just moved
to Washington State.

1:01:41.284 --> 1:01:43.536
I didn't really have any places
to go gig

1:01:43.578 --> 1:01:45.330
or, like, do many performances.

1:01:45.372 --> 1:01:48.958
And so I found my niche
in posting on YouTube

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:50.627
and making covers at home.

1:01:50.669 --> 1:01:53.755
But my mom and my dad encouraged
me to audition for "The Voice".

1:01:53.797 --> 1:01:57.634
I thought, It's too big for me.
Like, I'm too scared.

1:01:57.676 --> 1:02:00.095
* I miss you more than life *

1:02:00.136 --> 1:02:01.930
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:02:01.971 --> 1:02:03.390
I had a four-chair turn.

1:02:03.431 --> 1:02:05.350
It still blows my mind
to think about.

1:02:05.392 --> 1:02:06.726
It definitely adds pressure

1:02:06.768 --> 1:02:08.436
because it's almost like,
"Let's see you carry that

1:02:08.478 --> 1:02:09.854
out throughout
all of your performances."

1:02:09.896 --> 1:02:12.440
And so I know that I have
to really bring it.

1:02:12.482 --> 1:02:16.069
Your voice has these
two different modes

1:02:16.111 --> 1:02:17.445
where you go
kind of breathy.

1:02:17.487 --> 1:02:19.239
I feel like it's because
you don't have

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.449
enough support
in your tummy.

1:02:21.491 --> 1:02:24.911
When you're like
* Lying in my bed *

1:02:24.953 --> 1:02:27.038
like, it shouldn't be like
[Softly] * Lying *

1:02:27.080 --> 1:02:29.541
'cause that's when you're not
doing the diaphragm thing.

1:02:29.582 --> 1:02:31.167
It's almost
like an ab workout.

1:02:31.209 --> 1:02:33.044
Like, you should be
thinking of your core.

1:02:33.086 --> 1:02:35.213
There's a difference
between * I *

1:02:35.255 --> 1:02:37.048
and, * I-oh *

1:02:37.090 --> 1:02:38.383
* I will be *

1:02:38.425 --> 1:02:40.135
It's good to have breath,
but you can still get

1:02:40.176 --> 1:02:41.553
that same effect
of having breath

1:02:41.594 --> 1:02:42.971
by just keeping it
in the back.

1:02:43.013 --> 1:02:44.180
Okay.

1:02:44.222 --> 1:02:45.724
Reina,
I feel like you do

1:02:45.765 --> 1:02:48.435
that full breathing thing
so well.

1:02:48.476 --> 1:02:50.145
I think it was cool
when you added

1:02:50.186 --> 1:02:52.063
those little vocal cries,
like the * When you're lost *

1:02:52.105 --> 1:02:56.151
* And you look * like that,
like, those are really cool.

1:02:56.192 --> 1:02:57.736
And for this song,

1:02:57.777 --> 1:03:00.655
I think both of you guys
could play with more emotion.

1:03:00.697 --> 1:03:04.409
Okay.
Just don't worry about it
being perfect.

1:03:04.451 --> 1:03:07.287
That matters way more
than pitch-perfect notes.

1:03:07.328 --> 1:03:09.622
This song is about
how time flies.

1:03:09.664 --> 1:03:10.707
When I was little,

1:03:10.749 --> 1:03:12.250
my daddy used to play
this song a lot.

1:03:12.292 --> 1:03:13.752
And so when I think back
to this song, you know,

1:03:13.793 --> 1:03:16.463
it's like little me
who, like, dreams

1:03:16.504 --> 1:03:18.423
of maybe being here one day.

1:03:18.465 --> 1:03:19.924
It would just be amazing

1:03:19.966 --> 1:03:22.427
to be able to advance
and make it to knockouts.

1:03:22.469 --> 1:03:25.263
Make your intention
so emotional

1:03:25.305 --> 1:03:27.307
that that's the biggest emotion
that you feel.

1:03:27.349 --> 1:03:28.767
Play and tinker
with that,

1:03:28.808 --> 1:03:32.312
but when it's stage time,
screw it and have a ball

1:03:32.354 --> 1:03:33.813
because
that's what matters.

1:03:33.855 --> 1:03:35.607
You know, when brides get, like,
really stressed about

1:03:35.648 --> 1:03:37.442
the wedding and they're like,
"Oh my God, my wedding."

1:03:37.484 --> 1:03:39.319
And then they end up
not having any fun.

1:03:39.361 --> 1:03:40.737
You know what the best
wedding is,

1:03:40.779 --> 1:03:43.239
is when the bride
is having the most fun.

1:03:43.281 --> 1:03:45.658
That's right.
So you guys are the brides.

1:03:45.700 --> 1:03:47.577
* If you're lost,
you can look *

1:03:47.619 --> 1:03:49.621
* And you will find me *

1:03:49.662 --> 1:03:52.082
Yeah.
* Time after time *

1:03:52.123 --> 1:03:53.625
Grace: Reina has
a very powerful voice,

1:03:53.667 --> 1:03:55.335
and she's able to do
these vocal cries

1:03:55.377 --> 1:03:56.544
that I just cannot do.

1:03:56.586 --> 1:03:59.631
* Time after time *
Whoo!

1:03:59.673 --> 1:04:01.800

and have a good time.

You guys are monsters!
Get out of here!

1:04:04.511 --> 1:04:05.887
Thank you.
Yes!

1:04:05.929 --> 1:04:07.430
Did you feel better hitting
that high note?

1:04:07.472 --> 1:04:09.474
I did. I did.
It sounded so much better.

1:04:09.516 --> 1:04:11.434
You did the * Ti-i-i-ime *

1:04:11.476 --> 1:04:13.061
It was so -- Me and Camila
looked at each other like,

1:04:13.103 --> 1:04:14.604
"That was so clean!"

1:04:14.646 --> 1:04:18.525
For Reina and Grace, it's
gonna be about being emotional

1:04:18.566 --> 1:04:23.530
and letting that magic thing
shine through in a song

1:04:23.571 --> 1:04:26.408
that's, like, kind of hard
to pull off.

1:04:26.449 --> 1:04:28.743

of your voice

into this song.

is so really just --

your time like that

into that verse

it was really, really pretty.

that you understood

and saying.

more of what you would do.

1:10:22.013 --> 1:10:23.556
I love you.
I'm sorry.

1:10:23.598 --> 1:10:25.392
I just lost Grace, you know?

1:10:25.433 --> 1:10:27.894
Daly: Grace, anything you want
to say to your coach?

1:10:27.936 --> 1:10:29.145
I do.

1:10:29.187 --> 1:10:30.647
I agree with everything
that you said,

1:10:30.689 --> 1:10:31.856
and I really appreciate
your feedback,

1:10:31.898 --> 1:10:33.233
all of y'all's feedback,
honestly,

1:10:33.274 --> 1:10:35.694
because I know
that I have a lot to work on.

1:10:35.735 --> 1:10:37.070
You have a lot
to work <i>with.</i>

1:10:37.112 --> 1:10:38.571
You're so...
You're great.

1:10:38.613 --> 1:10:39.989
Yeah,
you're so great.
Thank you.

1:10:40.031 --> 1:10:41.700
I'm gonna take
all of your advice

1:10:41.741 --> 1:10:43.159
and take it to heart
and really work on it.

1:10:43.201 --> 1:10:45.370
Give it up one more time
for Grace Bello!

1:10:45.412 --> 1:10:46.996
Thank you.

1:10:47.038 --> 1:10:48.790
Camila:
It's hard to let people go,

1:10:48.832 --> 1:10:50.291
and especially younger people,

1:10:50.333 --> 1:10:52.752
but I think it is important
for people to remember

1:10:52.794 --> 1:10:54.087
that this is a path

1:10:54.129 --> 1:10:57.048
and there's always
more opportunities,

1:10:57.090 --> 1:10:59.843
and you never know
what's around the corner.

1:11:06.474 --> 1:11:07.809
* This is "The Voice" *

1:11:07.851 --> 1:11:10.103
Daly: Welcome back.

1:11:10.145 --> 1:11:12.856
Gwen: I've been really shocked
by everybody's teams.

1:11:12.897 --> 1:11:16.943
And Blake, actually, the loser
of the blinds, we thought...

1:11:16.985 --> 1:11:18.903
Right.
...has, like, incredible
singers.

1:11:18.945 --> 1:11:20.155
You are the underdog
no more.

1:11:20.196 --> 1:11:21.364
Yeah.
Daly:
Yeah, definitely.

1:11:21.406 --> 1:11:23.324
I've had artists
that entered this show

1:11:23.366 --> 1:11:26.995
without the ability to sing...
[ Laughter ]

1:11:27.037 --> 1:11:28.872
....and then go on
to win "The Voice".

1:11:28.913 --> 1:11:30.665
You're a great coach,
you're a great coach.

1:11:30.707 --> 1:11:31.875
Did you see what
happened to me?

1:11:31.916 --> 1:11:33.376
What happened there?
Jay left me.

1:11:33.418 --> 1:11:35.086
Oh, yeah,
he ditched you for him.

1:11:35.128 --> 1:11:36.546
Literally leaves me
on television.

1:11:36.588 --> 1:11:38.006
He tried
to break you guys up.

1:11:38.048 --> 1:11:40.300
I just want to recount
the fact that Carson tried

1:11:40.342 --> 1:11:42.594
to break you guys up after
he officiated your wedding.

1:11:42.635 --> 1:11:45.013
I needed to see to make sure
that the union is sturdy.

1:11:45.055 --> 1:11:46.306
Oh!
And it is.

1:11:46.348 --> 1:11:47.682
That's what it was.
You passed the test.

1:11:47.724 --> 1:11:49.100
Yay.

1:11:49.142 --> 1:11:51.019
Uh, there's probably gonna be
a lump of coal

1:11:51.061 --> 1:11:54.189
in my stocking
this Christmas from Gwen.

1:11:54.230 --> 1:11:56.733
**

1:11:56.775 --> 1:11:58.068
You look good.
You look great.

1:11:58.109 --> 1:11:59.778
You look amazing.
You look astonishing.

1:11:59.819 --> 1:12:01.529
Let's kill it.

1:12:01.571 --> 1:12:03.073
So this one's
kinda crazy.

1:12:03.114 --> 1:12:04.532
They're both
super talented,

1:12:04.574 --> 1:12:06.201
and we'll see
what happens.

1:12:06.242 --> 1:12:08.370
Oh.
Sean Paul is here!

1:12:08.411 --> 1:12:09.579
-Ohh!
-Yo.

1:12:09.621 --> 1:12:10.580
-Yes!
-Yo.

1:12:10.622 --> 1:12:12.040
Greetings.
[ Laughs ]

1:12:12.082 --> 1:12:13.375
When I walked in, I was like,
"Oh, my God.

1:12:13.416 --> 1:12:15.585
Do you know who you are?"
[ Laughs ]

1:12:15.627 --> 1:12:17.796
* Baby boy,
you stay on my mind *
Oh, my God! Yeah!

1:12:17.837 --> 1:12:19.005
* Fulfill my fan-- *

1:12:19.047 --> 1:12:20.382
* Oh, na, na, na *

1:12:20.423 --> 1:12:22.092
You worked with Beyoncé.
Can I shake your hand?

1:12:22.133 --> 1:12:24.010
Oh, Team Gwen.
Yes!

1:12:24.052 --> 1:12:25.553
Oh, my God,
that's so cool!

1:12:25.595 --> 1:12:27.055
I was gonna do it,
but I didn't have time.

1:12:27.097 --> 1:12:28.431
[ Laughs ]
It's okay.

1:12:28.473 --> 1:12:29.724
The spirit's there.

1:12:29.766 --> 1:12:31.059
Oh, my gosh,
you guys are so cute.

1:12:31.101 --> 1:12:33.228
I paired Destiny Leigh
and Justin together,

1:12:33.269 --> 1:12:36.564
because they both have
really powerful, soulful voices.

1:12:36.606 --> 1:12:40.568
So I picked "No More Drama"
by Mary J. Blige.

1:12:40.610 --> 1:12:43.238
* Hey *
* No drama *

1:12:43.279 --> 1:12:45.407
* I'm tired
of all the drama *

1:12:45.448 --> 1:12:47.534
Sean Paul:
Justin was extremely soulful,

1:12:47.575 --> 1:12:49.411
and he blew us all away.

1:12:49.452 --> 1:12:50.954
He knows what
he's here to do, man,

1:12:50.995 --> 1:12:53.915
and -- and what --
what kind of gift he has.

1:12:53.957 --> 1:12:55.750
* When you're free
from all the pain *

1:12:55.792 --> 1:12:57.293
* Free from all the pain *
* Free from all the... *

1:12:57.335 --> 1:12:59.129
I think what I love
about Destiny's voice

1:12:59.170 --> 1:13:01.923
is that she has
a lot of dynamics.

1:13:01.965 --> 1:13:04.634
She has, like,
a really powerful voice,

1:13:04.676 --> 1:13:06.553
and her tone is really pretty.

1:13:06.594 --> 1:13:11.891
* No more *
* In my life *

1:13:13.018 --> 1:13:16.938
Oh, my gosh, what?
Like, that was insane.

1:13:16.980 --> 1:13:18.773
With a song
with so much feeling,

1:13:18.815 --> 1:13:20.525
y'all made me feel
even more.

1:13:20.567 --> 1:13:22.110
Thank you so much.

1:13:22.152 --> 1:13:24.988
Destiny, sometimes you start
a note and then you're like,

1:13:25.030 --> 1:13:26.865
"Is this good?"
like in your brain.

1:13:26.906 --> 1:13:28.408
And then I hear
it kind of, like,

1:13:28.450 --> 1:13:30.952
get softer or get, like,
less powerful.

1:13:30.994 --> 1:13:33.621
Also, there was a part
in the part

1:13:33.663 --> 1:13:34.956
where you're
gonna be fine.

1:13:34.998 --> 1:13:36.207
It's like you were trying
to find the note.

1:13:36.249 --> 1:13:37.625
Destiny: Yeah.
You're like,

1:13:37.667 --> 1:13:40.128
"No, let me not go there,"
and you kind of held back.

1:13:40.170 --> 1:13:41.838
And it's almost like
a confidence thing.

1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:44.049
We're practicing here.
This is just like a playground,

1:13:44.090 --> 1:13:45.967
just so you can
just find yourself.

1:13:46.009 --> 1:13:47.218
I want you to
just be, like...

1:13:47.260 --> 1:13:48.720
Just let it all out,
yeah.

1:13:48.762 --> 1:13:51.931
Also, a little bit of timing
issues with the way harmonies

1:13:51.973 --> 1:13:53.183
were kind of going.

1:13:53.224 --> 1:13:55.226
Yeah, for sure.
I mean, Mary J. Blige,

1:13:55.268 --> 1:13:58.313
she's put so much
feeling into her songs,

1:13:58.355 --> 1:14:00.440
and there's, like, tracks
going all over the place,

1:14:00.482 --> 1:14:01.649
which you guys are doing.

1:14:01.691 --> 1:14:03.485
So to lock it properly

1:14:03.526 --> 1:14:05.653
is gonna help you
with the audience.

1:14:05.695 --> 1:14:06.905
Yeah.

1:14:06.946 --> 1:14:08.323
Also, I think it's good
to remember

1:14:08.365 --> 1:14:11.284
who -- who sang the song
and what she's been through.

1:14:11.326 --> 1:14:12.744
Mm.
And you guys need

1:14:12.786 --> 1:14:16.206
to feel that and bring it
to us in the song, as well.

1:14:16.247 --> 1:14:18.541
I love the song choice.
It's so deep, you know,

1:14:18.583 --> 1:14:20.585
and I feel like it connects
with my life.

1:14:20.627 --> 1:14:23.171
I grew up in an
underprivileged area --

1:14:23.213 --> 1:14:27.258
lots of gang violence,
and my mom's a single mother.

1:14:27.300 --> 1:14:30.512
When I was 2 years old,
we lived in a homeless shelter

1:14:30.553 --> 1:14:33.390
because my mom was struggling
a lot financially.

1:14:33.431 --> 1:14:34.724
Singing this song,

1:14:34.766 --> 1:14:36.434
I just think of releasing
that drama in your life

1:14:36.476 --> 1:14:39.354
and using the opportunity
that I think, you know,

1:14:39.396 --> 1:14:42.816
God has given me to create
a positive life for myself.

1:14:42.857 --> 1:14:46.152
* I've been in so many places *
Leading up to the blinds,

1:14:46.194 --> 1:14:47.946
it felt like I was gonna die,
'cause I was so scared.

1:14:47.987 --> 1:14:49.364
But Gwen turned.

1:14:49.406 --> 1:14:50.865
Whoo!

1:14:50.907 --> 1:14:53.868
You're really deeply connected
to your heart and your soul,

1:14:53.910 --> 1:14:55.286
and it just seemed
very genuine.

1:14:55.328 --> 1:14:58.039
I never expected
to make it this far.

1:14:58.081 --> 1:15:00.375
So I'm super excited
and grateful to be here.

1:15:00.417 --> 1:15:03.253
Justin, you sing like
you're not trying,

1:15:03.294 --> 1:15:07.590
but yet there's so much emotion
and so much accuracy

1:15:07.632 --> 1:15:10.427
in the notes
that you're hitting.
Thank you.

1:15:10.468 --> 1:15:13.722
I can't remember,
like, where do you sing?

1:15:13.763 --> 1:15:15.056
I sing at church.

1:15:15.098 --> 1:15:17.100
Justin: A few weeks ago,
I was at my church

1:15:17.142 --> 1:15:19.060
just singing praise and worship.

1:15:19.102 --> 1:15:20.562
Outside of my church,

1:15:20.603 --> 1:15:23.148
I work at the high school
as a teacher's assistant.

1:15:23.189 --> 1:15:26.276
I work with students
who have behavioral issues.

1:15:26.317 --> 1:15:28.987
What I want my students to think
when they see this

1:15:29.029 --> 1:15:31.406
is hard work
and dedication does pay off.

1:15:31.448 --> 1:15:33.908
It doesn't matter
how many people tell you no.

1:15:33.950 --> 1:15:35.410
All it takes is one yes.

1:15:35.452 --> 1:15:38.580
* We'll cry glory *
Incredible.

1:15:38.621 --> 1:15:40.915
* Glory, glory *

* Yeah, yeah, yeah *

Me and you are going places,
buddy.

1:15:51.760 --> 1:15:53.678
of Gwen Stefani and Sean Paul.

1:15:53.720 --> 1:15:57.432
I'm literally walking
in an answered prayer.

1:15:57.474 --> 1:16:03.938
* No more *
* No more, No more *

1:16:03.980 --> 1:16:05.857
Wow, that was,
like, way better.

1:16:05.899 --> 1:16:09.903
This is gonna be a really great,
dramatic moment for both of you

1:16:09.944 --> 1:16:13.948
to really get, like, your stage
body performance going.

1:16:13.990 --> 1:16:15.825
I need to see it
in your face.

1:16:15.867 --> 1:16:17.285
I need to see
the whole thing.

1:16:17.327 --> 1:16:18.953
Both of you -- awesome.

1:16:18.995 --> 1:16:20.372
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

1:16:20.413 --> 1:16:22.499
The winner of this battle
will be the person

1:16:22.540 --> 1:16:24.125
who just gives their heart,
man.

1:16:24.167 --> 1:16:26.211
Thank you so much.
And they both are doing that.

1:16:26.252 --> 1:16:27.962
So they're on the right path.

1:16:28.004 --> 1:16:29.005
Yes, alright.
Thank you.

1:16:29.047 --> 1:16:30.131

1:19:32.313 --> 1:19:33.732
Aww.

1:19:35.150 --> 1:19:37.152
That was electrifying.

1:19:37.193 --> 1:19:38.945

Destiny, you were,
like, on fire out there.

1:19:44.451 --> 1:19:45.869
Thank you so much.

1:19:45.910 --> 1:19:48.329
You were fun to watch,
fun to listen to.

1:19:48.371 --> 1:19:50.915
You brought just so much
energy and passion

1:19:50.957 --> 1:19:52.375
to the performance.

1:19:52.417 --> 1:19:55.337
Justin, you have
crazy range.

1:19:55.378 --> 1:19:57.130
Those high notes, you were
hitting them flawlessly.

1:19:57.172 --> 1:19:59.716
It was, like,
really impressive.
Oh, my God. Thank you.

1:19:59.758 --> 1:20:02.802
This is a hard decision,
because, Destiny, I couldn't

1:20:02.844 --> 1:20:04.679
take my eyes off her,
and she was just so exciting.

1:20:04.721 --> 1:20:07.807
And Justin, I feel like
was a more disciplined

1:20:07.849 --> 1:20:09.392
and accurate singer.

1:20:09.434 --> 1:20:11.686
I'm going to say...

1:20:11.728 --> 1:20:12.896
Destiny.

1:20:12.937 --> 1:20:14.314
Wow, okay.

1:20:14.356 --> 1:20:16.232
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:20:16.274 --> 1:20:19.694
Destiny, I mean, you've made
this really tough for Gwen,

1:20:19.736 --> 1:20:23.573
because Justin
is incredible, powerful,

1:20:23.615 --> 1:20:25.658
consistent,
everything you want.

1:20:25.700 --> 1:20:27.911
But then Destiny,
she's 18 years old,

1:20:27.952 --> 1:20:31.581
so we know the leap
you had to make

1:20:31.623 --> 1:20:33.667
to get toe to toe
with Justin.

1:20:33.708 --> 1:20:35.835
And I'll be damned
if you didn't do it.

1:20:35.877 --> 1:20:38.088
And I think I would probably go
with Destiny also.

1:20:38.129 --> 1:20:39.297
Oh, my gosh.

1:20:39.339 --> 1:20:41.299
Thank you so much.

1:20:41.341 --> 1:20:43.927
I'm gonna hop
on the Destiny love wagon,

1:20:43.968 --> 1:20:46.805
because I can't believe
that you're 18 years old.

1:20:46.846 --> 1:20:49.724
Going against Justin,
it's a tall task.

1:20:49.766 --> 1:20:52.102
And you were giving it
everything you had.

1:20:52.143 --> 1:20:53.520
That being said,

1:20:53.561 --> 1:20:56.314
now I'm gonna hop
on the Justin love wagon.

1:20:56.356 --> 1:20:57.607
Okay.

1:20:57.649 --> 1:21:00.402
It's not just
the technical command

1:21:00.443 --> 1:21:01.986
that you have
of your voice,

1:21:02.028 --> 1:21:03.196
for me, it's your tone.

1:21:03.238 --> 1:21:04.948
It's just like honey
in my ears.

1:21:04.989 --> 1:21:07.867
And I think that
that is what's so special

1:21:07.909 --> 1:21:09.577
and can't
really be trained.

1:21:09.619 --> 1:21:13.289
So, to me, the winner
of this battle was Justin.

1:21:13.331 --> 1:21:15.750
Daly: Thank you, Coaches.

1:21:15.792 --> 1:21:17.127
Alright, Gwen, you have
the final decision.

1:21:17.168 --> 1:21:19.671
Give us some thoughts
first on the battle.

1:21:19.713 --> 1:21:23.091
This is super hard for me,
because I think that Destiny

1:21:23.133 --> 1:21:25.760
has so much potential,
and a lot of times

1:21:25.802 --> 1:21:28.138
it's not just about the vocal,
it's about the spirit,

1:21:28.179 --> 1:21:30.098
it's about letting somebody
into your heart.

1:21:30.140 --> 1:21:31.641
When you sing out hard,

1:21:31.683 --> 1:21:33.101
you hit this place
where you're like,

1:21:33.143 --> 1:21:34.769
"That's her potential."

1:21:34.811 --> 1:21:36.563
And then there's other times
where I feel like it's kind of

1:21:36.604 --> 1:21:39.315
wiggly and underneath
and not quite in tune.

1:21:39.357 --> 1:21:40.775
But then you have
this stage presence

1:21:40.817 --> 1:21:42.694
that kind of makes up
for that.

1:21:42.736 --> 1:21:44.988
And, Justin,
your voice is butter.
Camila: Yeah.

1:21:45.030 --> 1:21:47.157
I mean, it literally
is so beautiful.

1:21:47.198 --> 1:21:50.326
Mwah!
This is why this show
is so special,

1:21:50.368 --> 1:21:53.705
to meet people like you that
are given this God-given gift.

1:21:53.747 --> 1:21:55.582
So this is really tough,
you know?

1:21:55.623 --> 1:21:58.001
Gwen, who is the winner
of this battle?

1:21:58.043 --> 1:22:02.005

in this battle, guys....

1:22:02.047 --> 1:22:04.341

1:22:04.382 --> 1:22:08.219

you won this battle.

1:22:09.971 --> 1:22:11.181
Give it up

1:22:11.222 --> 1:22:15.685
for Justin Aaron,
moving on to the knockout.

1:22:15.727 --> 1:22:17.604
Gwen: I knew that Justin
was incredible

1:22:17.645 --> 1:22:20.106
when I pushed my button.
Congratulations.

1:22:20.148 --> 1:22:22.734
I feel like this season people
are gonna see Justin and go,

1:22:22.776 --> 1:22:25.653
"What was that?"
like he's so gifted.

1:22:25.695 --> 1:22:27.197
Coaches, let me remind you
that Destiny

1:22:27.238 --> 1:22:28.698
is available to save.

1:22:28.740 --> 1:22:30.533
Destiny, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

1:22:30.575 --> 1:22:32.035
I just want to say, Gwen,

1:22:32.077 --> 1:22:34.788
you are such an inspiration,
and I'm so grateful

1:22:34.829 --> 1:22:36.581
to have this opportunity.
Thank you.

1:22:36.623 --> 1:22:39.709

the time to do her nails

1:23:05.694 --> 1:23:07.696

on Team Gwen.

Honestly, I really want
to get to know you more.

1:23:13.952 --> 1:23:16.579
So I'm excited!

1:23:16.621 --> 1:23:18.915
Destiny made all
the coaches light up,

1:23:18.957 --> 1:23:21.251
and there was just
a glow about her.

1:23:21.292 --> 1:23:22.919
So I had to save Destiny.

Give it up for Destiny Leigh.

1:23:25.046 --> 1:23:28.591
I can't believe that she, like,
wanted to save me.

1:23:28.633 --> 1:23:30.760
I want to show Gwen...

1:23:30.802 --> 1:23:32.929
What do you want to show me?
Oh!

1:23:32.971 --> 1:23:34.305
Oh, my gosh!

1:23:34.347 --> 1:23:35.724
It's me. I'm getting
connected to you with my dress.

1:23:35.765 --> 1:23:37.267
Every time I see you,
I fangirl.

1:23:37.308 --> 1:23:38.852
And I'm sorry.
Oh. [ Laughs ]

1:23:38.893 --> 1:23:40.687

That was so amazing.

1:23:40.729 --> 1:23:41.938
Let me see the nails now
up close.

1:23:41.980 --> 1:23:43.815
Thank you.
Ooh, those are so cool!

1:23:43.857 --> 1:23:45.442
They're, like, gonna get
caught in your hair, right?

1:23:45.483 --> 1:23:47.736
Yeah.
I'm about to take them off.

1:23:47.777 --> 1:23:49.738
Gwen: Overall,
I thought the performance

1:23:49.779 --> 1:23:51.573
was really heartfelt,
dramatic,

1:23:51.614 --> 1:23:54.951
and everything it needed to be,
so I was really proud of them.

1:23:54.993 --> 1:23:57.245
That was sweet.
That was tricky, Gwen.

1:23:57.287 --> 1:23:58.997
So, so, so sweet.
I'm, like, shaking, look!

1:23:59.039 --> 1:24:00.957
Oh, my God, so sweet.
I like -- I like the late save.

1:24:00.999 --> 1:24:03.126
That was good.
Gave a hug,
and then a save.

1:24:03.168 --> 1:24:06.212

it should be on TV.
