00:05.817 --> 00:08.285
Well, Will, I pressed 180 today.

00:10.155 --> 00:11.679
<i>E</i> at your heart out.

00:13.000 --> 00:19.074

00:24.469 --> 00:26.630
Way to go, Arnold Schwarzenegro.

00:26.905 --> 00:28.634
Y ou know, I've had it up to here with you.

00:28.707 --> 00:31.267
Right now, me and you, <i>mano a mano.</i>
Let's go. Come on.

00:31.343 --> 00:33.834
- Y ou're on.
- Go.

01:53.792 --> 01:56.693
Come on, Carlton, you can't keep
moping around like this forever.

01:56.762 --> 01:59.822
I mean, it's not like you and Paula
just broke up yesterday, man.

01:59.898 --> 02:02.230
Y ou've had the whole weekend
to get over it.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.894
Will, sometimes you're so insensitive.

02:05.070 --> 02:07.903
Love isn't something
you can just turn on and off.

02:07.973 --> 02:11.204
Carlton, I still think you're blowing
this whole thing out of proportion, man.

02:11.309 --> 02:14.676
Now, I've seen Paula,
and I don't see what the attraction was.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.481
What are you talking about?

02:17.549 --> 02:20.780
She's a beautiful, intelligent girl
with a dynamite body.

02:20.852 --> 02:23.719
Y eah, I know.
I don't see what attracted her to you.

02:25.123 --> 02:26.852
These are jokes, man.
Y ou gotta loosen up.

02:26.925 --> 02:28.153
Y ou gotta have some fun.

02:28.226 --> 02:31.559
Y ou gotta do something or go someplace
that gets her off your mind.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.029
It's impossible.

02:33.131 --> 02:35.793
<i>E</i> verywhere I turn,
I see something that reminds me of her.

02:35.867 --> 02:40.497
Something we've shared together,
a patch of grass, a beach blanket, a swing.

02:42.541 --> 02:44.338
Maybe you should go to bed.

02:45.444 --> 02:47.878
Vivian, why are you making
such a big deal about this?

02:47.946 --> 02:52.076
- I say we do it right here, right now.
- Oh, good, a floor show.

02:54.886 --> 02:57.787
Geoffrey, this envelope contains
Mrs. Banks' sonogram.

02:57.856 --> 03:00.347
It's gonna tell us whether or not
the baby is a boy or a girl.

03:00.425 --> 03:05.021
- How can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?
- Ashley, you are so naive.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.928
If it's a boy, it's blue.

03:11.203 --> 03:14.468
Come on, I think it's time
for another woman-to-woman talk.

03:15.407 --> 03:17.807
Okay, what do you want to know
this time?

03:20.278 --> 03:22.838
Hilary's not planning on having kids,
is she?

03:23.315 --> 03:25.647
Philip, I am not looking at this sonogram.

03:25.717 --> 03:27.912
It'll take away the excitement
in the delivery room.

03:27.986 --> 03:30.284
Honey, half the thrill is finding out.

03:30.422 --> 03:32.947
All right, then, it's settled.
We don't want to know.

03:33.024 --> 03:36.619
Of course, in the delivery room,
I'm going to be too busy screaming.

03:36.695 --> 03:39.926
Okay, I want to know. No, I don't.
Y es, I do. Here.

03:41.099 --> 03:44.466
Now this is exactly why the doctor
changed his number on us, Vivian.

03:46.204 --> 03:49.367
Now for the last time,
do you want to know or don't you?

03:49.541 --> 03:53.375
- No.
- Fine, then I'll take the envelope.

03:53.979 --> 03:57.005
I'm not going to open it. I promise.
Trust me.

03:58.049 --> 03:59.573
Aunt Viv, I don't think so.

03:59.651 --> 04:03.985
See, this is the same dude that said
a squirrel ate that six-pack of Milky Ways.

04:05.423 --> 04:08.517
I think Geoffrey should hold onto it.

04:08.593 --> 04:10.254
Fine, and don't give it to us.

04:10.328 --> 04:12.421
- No matter how much we insist.
- Got it?

04:12.497 --> 04:16.661
I think I can handle that.
I got dressed all by myself this morning.

04:18.970 --> 04:20.062
I feel good about this, Philip.

04:20.137 --> 04:21.867
I think we're doing the right thing,
don't you?

04:21.940 --> 04:24.670
Y es, I agree, baby.
We're doing the right thing.

04:24.810 --> 04:26.471
Uncle Phil?

04:27.212 --> 04:29.510
Can I talk to you for a second?

04:29.815 --> 04:31.715
Y eah, sure, Will. What is it?

04:33.718 --> 04:35.982
Look, a friend of mine has a little problem.

04:36.054 --> 04:37.112
And, you know, I was wondering...

04:37.189 --> 04:40.090
- since you're a judge and everything...
- I am not reducing bail.

04:40.158 --> 04:43.093
No, Uncle Phil, no. See, that's not...
See, check it out.

04:43.328 --> 04:47.924
Now, this friend of mine knows this squaw
that he's completely in love with, right?

04:48.166 --> 04:51.727
But this particular squaw
just broke up with his best friend.

04:51.870 --> 04:54.771
Now he don't want to diss his boy
or nothing like that, right...

04:54.840 --> 04:58.901
but he wants to know how long
is a good time to wait...

04:58.977 --> 05:02.845
before he raids this squaw's village,
if you know what I'm saying.

05:02.914 --> 05:04.438
Interesting you should bring that up.

05:04.850 --> 05:07.045
I had a case like that
come before me just recently.

05:07.118 --> 05:08.517
- Really?
- Word up.

05:13.058 --> 05:15.583
Now this guy started going out
with his best friend's girl...

05:15.660 --> 05:17.389
hours after they broke up.

05:17.629 --> 05:18.755
He waited that long?

05:18.830 --> 05:20.764
Well, this other guy didn't think
it was that long.

05:20.832 --> 05:23.357
He was very jealous,
and he shot his friend.

05:24.302 --> 05:25.394
Dead?

05:25.470 --> 05:30.305
No. Let's just say
he's two olives short of a martini.

05:34.980 --> 05:37.915
So before your friend
starts raiding any villages...

05:37.983 --> 05:40.008
he better be sure it's worth it.

05:43.788 --> 05:46.313
Hey, Paula. How're you doing? It's Will.

05:47.926 --> 05:49.894
Look, about our date tonight...

05:53.331 --> 05:54.855
I'll rock your world.

06:03.074 --> 06:06.407
- Geoffrey, is Mrs. Banks around?
- I believe...

06:09.147 --> 06:11.138
I believe she's in the study.

06:11.216 --> 06:12.706
- Shall I get her?
- No!

06:14.152 --> 06:16.882
No, you do too much
running around, as it is.

06:16.955 --> 06:18.354
I hate having you run and do everything.

06:18.423 --> 06:21.722
- Mr. Banks, have you been drinking?
- Of course not.

06:21.793 --> 06:24.626
Y ou know, and I'd feel a lot better
if you started calling me Phil.

06:24.696 --> 06:28.063
And I'd feel a lot better
if you'd wash your own underthings.

06:31.269 --> 06:32.827
Look, Geoffrey...

06:33.271 --> 06:35.102
now I know Mrs. Banks and I
made you promise...

06:35.173 --> 06:36.435
not to show us that sonogram...

06:36.508 --> 06:39.204
but, look, I've got to know
whether the baby is a boy or a girl...

06:39.277 --> 06:41.643
and I can make it worth your while.

06:43.381 --> 06:47.215
- How does a $100 sound?
- Like one hell of a night in Tijuana.

06:47.719 --> 06:51.621
Philip Banks,
you really should be ashamed of yourself.

06:51.723 --> 06:54.817
- Bribing Geoffrey with a $100.
- I'll say.

06:55.060 --> 06:57.119
At least she offered me $200.

07:02.367 --> 07:05.564
Hello? Hi, Paula. Carlton's not here.

07:07.339 --> 07:09.068
Well, who'd you want to talk to?

07:11.543 --> 07:12.908
Just a second.

07:18.550 --> 07:21.246
It's for you. It's Paula...

07:21.419 --> 07:23.683
as in Carlton's ex-girlfriend, Paula.

07:24.789 --> 07:25.778
Gee...

07:26.624 --> 07:28.922
I wonder why she want to talk to me.

07:30.128 --> 07:32.028
Maybe I should just find out.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.433
Hey, Paula, how're you doing?

07:41.573 --> 07:44.406
Hey, I'm really looking forward to tonight,
so we can...

07:47.545 --> 07:49.103
work on some homework.

07:50.415 --> 07:53.111
Y eah, but you should probably
get some rest.

07:53.418 --> 07:55.716
We might have to pull an all nighter.

07:57.322 --> 07:58.721
Talk to you later.

08:01.026 --> 08:04.291
Will, dating Carlton's ex
behind his back isn't nice.

08:04.362 --> 08:08.162
Ashley's right. If Carlton finds out,
he may never speak to you again.

08:08.433 --> 08:10.333
Maybe you're on to something.

08:10.702 --> 08:12.863
Hold it. First, look, number one...

08:12.937 --> 08:15.462
Carlton is not even
dating this girl no more. Okay?

08:15.540 --> 08:18.338
Number two,
I ain't see no rings on her fingers. Okay?

08:19.177 --> 08:22.169
And number three, Denise got it going on.

08:22.313 --> 08:23.507
Paula.

08:23.581 --> 08:26.379
Y ou're right.
I hope that doesn't happen tonight.

08:29.154 --> 08:31.918
Boy, that Paula's really bad news.

08:32.123 --> 08:34.886
First, she dumps me.
Now you know what she did?

08:35.059 --> 08:37.927
No. Will, do you know?

08:40.631 --> 08:42.099
No, I don't know nothing.

08:42.167 --> 08:45.227
I'm just a poor black man
trying to make it in Bel-Air.

08:47.072 --> 08:48.801
She gave me the flu.

08:50.942 --> 08:53.035
Wait, come on,
look on the bright side, Carlton.

08:53.111 --> 08:55.238
Most girls don't give you nothing.

08:56.614 --> 09:00.345
- Hi, baby, how was school?
- Mommy, I don't feel so good.

09:00.485 --> 09:03.784
- I think I got the flu.
- That's too bad, baby.

09:04.122 --> 09:05.646
Get out of the house.

09:06.825 --> 09:10.761
Y ou know, we're getting more and more
like the Jackson family every day.

09:11.396 --> 09:12.727
Sweetheart, you know I love you...

09:12.797 --> 09:16.096
but being pregnant, I cannot take
a chance of getting sick. Now shoo.

09:16.367 --> 09:17.891
But where will I go?

09:17.969 --> 09:20.130
Well, I guess you'll have to move
into the pool house.

09:20.205 --> 09:23.368
The pool house?
Daddy, I live in the pool house.

09:23.441 --> 09:25.568
And there's no way
I'm giving it up for Carlton.

09:25.643 --> 09:27.577
Y ou want to start paying rent?

09:27.745 --> 09:29.440
I can be out in an hour.

09:35.253 --> 09:38.916
Will, I am not through with you.
What you're doing is despicable.

09:39.023 --> 09:41.856
And what you're doing is annoying.
Leave me alone.

09:43.828 --> 09:44.817
<i>Gesundheit.</i>

09:45.163 --> 09:47.688
Will, just a week ago,
she was Carlton's girlfriend.

09:47.765 --> 09:49.733
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

09:49.801 --> 09:52.599
Y es, Ashley,
it means she's having a better week.

09:54.472 --> 09:56.531
Well, Carlton's going to put
two and two together.

09:56.608 --> 09:58.701
First, Paula had the flu,
then Carlton had the flu...

09:58.776 --> 10:00.505
and now you have the flu.

10:00.645 --> 10:03.307
Ashley, I think you're giving Carlton
too much credit.

10:03.381 --> 10:05.076
I mean, come on,
he thinks <i>X</i> is the movie...

10:05.150 --> 10:07.880
about Malcolm-Jamal Warner's
fight for freedom.

10:10.855 --> 10:14.154
Very funny, guys.
Why don't you stop spinning?

10:15.293 --> 10:18.319
Who moved the refrigerator
all the way over there?

10:18.930 --> 10:20.830
How are you feeling, Carlton?

10:21.699 --> 10:25.965
Remember the <i>Star Trek</i> where the insect
bored its way through the guy's brain?

10:26.070 --> 10:28.834
- Y eah.
- That'd feel kind of good right now.

10:38.283 --> 10:40.308
Okay, Will, I'm on to you.

10:40.418 --> 10:43.080
Hey, look, Carlton, man, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

10:43.154 --> 10:46.021
I'm not stupid, Will.
It's all coming together.

10:46.090 --> 10:48.115
The runny nose, the watery eyes.

10:48.193 --> 10:50.354
Y ou just couldn't keep
your hands to yourself.

10:50.428 --> 10:52.953
Look, Carlton, now I know you're sick.

10:53.031 --> 10:54.225
Y ou're probably a little delirious.

10:54.299 --> 10:57.791
Y ou probably had one too many of them
children's aspirins or something, man.

10:57.869 --> 11:01.999
- That piece was mine.
- Y ou ain't got to get all nasty.

11:04.242 --> 11:05.937
Well, you shouldn't have done it, Will.

11:06.010 --> 11:09.776
I know, Carlton. I'm sorry, man.
I shouldn't have taken Paula out.

11:09.847 --> 11:12.748
Y ou're right, man, but she was
coming on to me. I couldn't resist, man.

11:12.817 --> 11:13.977
Paula?

11:14.052 --> 11:16.885
I was talking about
that last piece of cheesecake.

11:19.624 --> 11:22.320
Y eah, so was I.

11:22.393 --> 11:24.884
No, see, you don't know about it.
See, you ain't hip to it, right?

11:24.963 --> 11:26.453
In Philly, we name our food, right?

11:26.531 --> 11:29.432
See, like cheesecake is Paula, right?

11:29.500 --> 11:32.333
And a Snack Pack is Boomshika.

11:40.845 --> 11:43.336
I can't see him. Y ou can. Is he buying it?

11:47.518 --> 11:50.510
Y ou backstabbing,
girlfriend-stealing, piece of rubbish.

11:50.588 --> 11:53.648
Did you really expect me to believe
you name your food?

11:53.825 --> 11:57.283
Look, Carlton, I'm telling you, man,
it ain't how it seems, man.

11:57.595 --> 12:00.758
Then you didn't go out
with my girlfriend behind my back?

12:00.965 --> 12:03.092
Okay, that's exactly how it seems.

12:03.401 --> 12:07.201
But, look, man, I didn't do it for me.
I did it for you.

12:08.106 --> 12:11.337
I did it to save you
from something terrible.

12:12.744 --> 12:15.474
As soon as I figure it out,
I'll let you know what it is.

12:15.546 --> 12:19.073
<i>E</i> very time you've tried to hurt me,
I've turned the other cheek.

12:19.250 --> 12:20.615
Well, I've run out of cheeks.

12:20.685 --> 12:22.414
Carlton, man, what are you trying to say?

12:22.487 --> 12:25.479
I'm trying to say
that I can't trust you anymore.

12:25.556 --> 12:29.048
Look, we're no longer family.
We're through. <i>Fini.</i> It's over.

12:29.460 --> 12:32.429
Look, Carlton, you don't mean that.
Y ou'll get over it, man.

12:32.497 --> 12:33.691
Oh, yeah?

12:37.135 --> 12:39.660
- Carlton, who are you calling?
- Y our mother.

12:42.006 --> 12:44.133
I know he ain't calling my mother.

12:45.510 --> 12:48.035
Aunt Vy, it's Carlton.
Call me when you get home.

12:48.112 --> 12:49.704
No, Mom, don't call him.

12:49.781 --> 12:51.510
I want to tell you
how much I hate Will's guts.

12:51.582 --> 12:53.243
He's lying, Mom. He loves me.

12:53.318 --> 12:55.445
No, I don't.
Y our little slimer's stolen my girl.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.420
Mom, you know Carlton never had no girl.

12:57.488 --> 12:59.046
Well, I'm glad you're out having fun...

12:59.123 --> 13:02.058
'cause I have to stay here, 'cause
God only knows what else he'll steal.

13:02.126 --> 13:04.094
Give me the phone. Get off!

13:04.662 --> 13:06.960
Hey, Mom. Thanks for the sweater.
Love you.

13:10.568 --> 13:12.729
Y ou've gone over the line. Okay?

13:13.705 --> 13:15.798
Y ou don't never call a dude's mom.

13:17.342 --> 13:19.173
So it's okay to steal a guy's girlfriend...

13:19.243 --> 13:21.541
as long as you don't go
tell his mommy about it.

13:21.612 --> 13:23.443
No, this is serious, man.

13:23.514 --> 13:24.742
<i>E</i> ven in ancient times...

13:24.816 --> 13:27.580
they would kill your cattle,
they would burn your village...

13:27.652 --> 13:28.846
and they would stone your family...

13:28.920 --> 13:31.411
but they wouldn't never
tell your mother, man.

13:32.623 --> 13:35.148
"But I did it to save you...

13:35.226 --> 13:37.126
"from something you don't know...

13:37.495 --> 13:41.158
"and soon as I figure it out,
I'll let you know."

13:44.235 --> 13:47.068
That's it. We're going to have to take this
to the street, man.

13:47.138 --> 13:48.400
Aunt Viv!

14:03.621 --> 14:07.819
Now, listen, as long as you're staying
in my home, you have to play by my rules.

14:07.892 --> 14:10.258
No crumbs on the carpet,
no hair in the sink...

14:10.328 --> 14:12.956
and no dressing up in my clothes, Carlton.

14:14.399 --> 14:17.698
- It was Halloween.
- Y ou still haven't returned my bustier.

14:24.008 --> 14:26.602
- What are you doing here?
- Look, man, I don't want to be here...

14:26.677 --> 14:29.111
but I'm sick, and Aunt Viv
won't let me stay in the house.

14:29.180 --> 14:31.444
I think you have everything you need.

14:31.949 --> 14:34.008
And now if you'll excuse me...

14:34.385 --> 14:37.912
I'm going to spend a quiet evening
with my radio and Madonna.

14:39.624 --> 14:42.889
Look like you spending the evening
with Little Richard.

14:47.532 --> 14:49.227
Well, I don't care what Mom says.

14:49.300 --> 14:52.167
Y ou're not staying here.
Why don't you go stay with Paula?

14:52.236 --> 14:55.433
- She asked. Her parents wouldn't let me.
- She has parents?

14:56.007 --> 14:59.670
She never introduced me to her parents.
She told me they were dead.

15:00.511 --> 15:02.741
I really, really hate you.

15:03.181 --> 15:05.809
I hate you, too.
Just get out of my bed, then.

15:07.618 --> 15:11.918
Man, nice, firm mattress,
just like the one at Paula's house.

15:15.059 --> 15:17.892
First, you steal my woman,
and now you steal my bed.

15:18.262 --> 15:20.162
Look, man,
let's get something straight right now.

15:20.231 --> 15:22.028
I did not steal your woman.

15:22.700 --> 15:26.067
I rescued her, and she thanked me over...

15:26.337 --> 15:28.362
and over, and over...

15:31.676 --> 15:33.940
All right, stop singing.

15:34.278 --> 15:35.836
Over and over and over.

15:35.913 --> 15:39.371
- Why don't you act like an adult?
- Why don't you look like one?

15:40.318 --> 15:42.479
Well, obviously,
there's no reasoning with you.

15:42.553 --> 15:45.215
Look, you just stay on your side
of the room, and I'll stay on mine.

15:45.289 --> 15:47.723
Fine. This is my side of the room.

15:48.759 --> 15:50.226
Hey, that's not fair.

15:51.062 --> 15:55.055
Guess I'll watch a little TV,
seeing as how it's on my side of the room.

15:57.468 --> 15:58.935
Y o, where's the remote?

16:00.972 --> 16:04.339
- On my side of the room.
- Toss it here.

16:04.475 --> 16:05.908
Whatever you say.

16:14.252 --> 16:16.015
Go get it.

16:18.422 --> 16:19.684
Make me.

16:30.201 --> 16:31.896
Oh God, my eye!

16:32.870 --> 16:34.303
Will, you okay?

16:41.345 --> 16:44.872
Thank you for giving me the night off.
Can I get you anything else?

16:44.949 --> 16:47.782
No, get out of here, you knucklehead.

16:50.555 --> 16:51.647
Good night.

16:53.524 --> 16:55.924
- Philip, I want that sonogram.
- Y es.

16:58.262 --> 17:00.526
- There's nothing here or here.
- Well, it's got to be here.

17:00.598 --> 17:01.997
We searched the whole house, Vivian.

17:02.066 --> 17:03.863
Well, what if he's got it on him?

17:04.602 --> 17:06.262
- Found it.
- Y ou found the sonogram?

17:06.337 --> 17:08.167
No, it's that little chocolate bunny
from <i>E</i> aster.

17:08.239 --> 17:12.608
- I've been looking all over for it.
- Philip, honey, at least take off the foil.

17:26.022 --> 17:29.220
- My head is killing me.
- My throat hurts.

17:32.463 --> 17:36.024
- Now my ears are ringing.
- Mine, too.

17:36.100 --> 17:37.567
<i>Hi, this is Hi/ary.</i>

17:37.935 --> 17:41.962
<i>Roses are red, vio/ets are b/ue,</i>
<i>/'m not in so...</i>

17:43.240 --> 17:44.730
<i>so /eave a...</i>

17:49.780 --> 17:52.340
<i>Hi, honey, it's Pau/a.</i>

17:52.416 --> 17:55.544
<i>/ just heard you were sick.</i>
<i>My poor /itt/e baby.</i>

17:55.620 --> 17:57.554
<i>This is a// my fau/t, isn't it?</i>

17:59.890 --> 18:02.916
- It's for me, man.
- No, it's not. It's for me.

18:04.128 --> 18:06.221
<i>/ wish / cou/d be there with you.</i>

18:06.597 --> 18:09.065
<i>/ bet / know how to make you fee/ better.</i>

18:09.300 --> 18:13.964
<i>First, /'d nibb/e on your /eft ear,</i>
<i>then /'d bite you on your neck.</i>

18:14.939 --> 18:15.803
<i>Then /'d...</i>

18:16.240 --> 18:18.572
<i>Oops. There's my other /ine.</i>

18:21.145 --> 18:22.407
Hello?

18:25.249 --> 18:28.047
Now look what you did, you idiot.
Y ou made me miss her call.

18:28.119 --> 18:30.280
That wasn't for you. It was for me.

18:31.222 --> 18:33.622
Carlton, give it up, man. She dumped you.

18:33.691 --> 18:36.990
I mean, you're like Prince Charles.
Y ou got the royal flush.

18:38.896 --> 18:40.659
I'm going to beat your butt.

18:40.731 --> 18:43.791
Y eah, what are you going to do?
Jump up and bang your head against it?

18:43.868 --> 18:46.860
- Come on, put your dukes up.
- Come on, boy.

18:53.210 --> 18:55.508
And there's more where that came from.

18:59.016 --> 19:00.244
Maybe not.

19:01.819 --> 19:03.047
Hey, Carlton.

19:05.456 --> 19:08.983
I'm going to do something
that's totally outside of my nature...

19:09.694 --> 19:12.185
and I'm gonna take Uncle Phil's advice.

19:12.663 --> 19:15.029
Y ou're gonna go play on the freeway?

19:17.301 --> 19:20.065
No, man,
I'm going to be straight up with you.

19:20.604 --> 19:24.301
I'm going to tell you everything
that happened between me and Paula.

19:24.475 --> 19:29.105
First time you brought her over here, man,
I thought she was so fine...

19:30.014 --> 19:32.448
and I wanted y'all to break up.

19:33.050 --> 19:36.042
That's very honest, Will, but I'm still mad.

19:37.154 --> 19:39.281
I guess I'll have to live with it.

19:40.191 --> 19:43.126
Wait, there's more.

19:44.729 --> 19:48.563
- I told her you had tuberculosis.
- Y ou what?

19:48.733 --> 19:51.668
Honest, I don't know, man.
It just came to me. I'm sorry.

19:51.736 --> 19:53.636
I can't believe you did that.

19:56.040 --> 19:59.305
I'm gonna dig way down deep inside...

19:59.376 --> 20:02.004
and maybe, in time,
I'll be able to forgive you.

20:03.447 --> 20:04.573
Wait.

20:06.050 --> 20:07.677
There's more.

20:08.919 --> 20:11.046
I told her about your hand puppet.

20:11.322 --> 20:14.553
Y ou told her about Binky? I'll kill you.

20:15.926 --> 20:19.487
No, I won't. I'm bigger than that.
I guess I'll be honest, too.

20:21.165 --> 20:24.225
Y ou remember when Letisha
suddenly stopped calling you?

20:24.301 --> 20:25.427
Y eah.

20:26.103 --> 20:28.003
Well, I told her you worship Satan.

20:32.143 --> 20:35.670
All right. Fair is fair.

20:35.913 --> 20:38.211
I'm a man. I can live with that.
I can live with that.

20:38.282 --> 20:40.147
Wait, there's more.

20:42.019 --> 20:46.183
Y ou notice how Ashley has been acting
very funny around you lately?

20:46.924 --> 20:48.050
Y eah.

20:48.826 --> 20:51.090
Well, I told her you shave your legs.

20:53.731 --> 20:56.666
- What kind of monster are you?
- Sorry, Will.

20:56.801 --> 20:59.031
I was just feeling a little jealous
of your relationship.

20:59.103 --> 21:02.231
No, that's unforgivable.
That's totally unforgivable.

21:03.874 --> 21:07.105
Wait, there's more.

21:07.711 --> 21:11.807
- Y ou remember your friend Jazz?
- Oh, my God, what did you do with Jazz?

21:12.750 --> 21:15.617
Y ou know that funky smell
coming from the basement?

21:16.754 --> 21:17.982
Psych.

21:19.089 --> 21:20.681
This honesty thing feels great.

21:20.758 --> 21:24.694
What do you say we tell Geoffrey
why his citizenship never came through?

21:33.604 --> 21:36.869
This smells delicious.
Y ou've really outdone yourself, Mom.

21:37.775 --> 21:40.266
- Great oatmeal, Mom.
- Thank you.

21:41.912 --> 21:46.679
Aunt Viv, in keeping with this
new honesty thing...

21:47.451 --> 21:50.716
this stuff kind of tastes
like dry wall with raisins in it.

21:56.861 --> 21:58.692
And, Uncle Phil, you know...

21:58.896 --> 22:03.060
you really shouldn't wear silk no more
'cause, like, when big folks wear silk...

22:05.669 --> 22:08.638
Well, since we're all being honest
with each other...

22:09.173 --> 22:12.233
I'm bloody sick of the two of you
going through my drawers.

22:12.309 --> 22:16.177
Here's your envelope.
I hope you get what you want.

22:17.915 --> 22:21.442
In keeping with all this honesty,
I really want to see what we're having.

22:21.518 --> 22:23.349
Y ou mean this isn't oatmeal?

22:24.121 --> 22:27.613
I want to know, too, Philip.
Okay, let's have a look at that sonogram.

22:27.691 --> 22:30.216
- Oh, my God.
- What is it, a boy or girl?

22:30.294 --> 22:33.593
This isn't a sonogram.
It's a bill for $25,000.

22:33.664 --> 22:35.757
This baby's costing me a fortune.

22:36.767 --> 22:39.167
Congratulations, you're having a Hilary.

22:48.045 --> 22:49.376
Philip, you found the sonogram?

22:49.446 --> 22:53.007
No, the little chocolate <i>E</i> aster bunny.
I've been looking at it...

22:54.451 --> 22:55.577
y ou found the sonogram?

22:55.653 --> 22:59.214
No, it's that little <i>E</i> aster chocolate bunny.
I've been looking for it all...

23:00.824 --> 23:01.984
y ou found the sonogram?

23:02.059 --> 23:06.120
No, it's that little chocolate bunny from
<i>E</i> aster. I've been looking at it all week.

23:08.198 --> 23:10.462
<i>/t's the /itt/e choco/ate Easter bunny!</i>
