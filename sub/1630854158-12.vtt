10:15.932 --> 10:17.490
Oh...

10:22.347 --> 10:24.180
Maggie, I'm sorry.

10:24.182 --> 10:25.531
(Maggie fussing)

10:25.533 --> 10:29.202
Poor Maggie. Although
I like the girl Nom-Nom.

10:29.204 --> 10:30.703
I like her a lot.

10:30.705 --> 10:33.539
I like the way her glasses
have eyelashes and...

10:33.541 --> 10:35.950
LUANN:
Milhouse,
come do your ear drops.

10:35.952 --> 10:37.510
Mom!

10:39.956 --> 10:40.864
(mouse clicks)

10:40.866 --> 10:41.865
Hey, guys.

10:41.867 --> 10:44.125
Welcome to episode 751 of

10:44.127 --> 10:46.052
<i> The Lenny and Carl Situation.</i>

10:46.054 --> 10:48.705
Back with us
is our frequent guest Moe.

10:48.707 --> 10:50.297
You gonna behave today, Moe?

10:50.299 --> 10:53.059
(chuckling):
Hey, don't cancel me, huh?

10:53.061 --> 10:55.320
Today we're talking about
the Simpson family,

10:55.322 --> 10:59.382
specifically "Super Dad"
himself, Homer Simpson.

10:59.384 --> 11:00.550
Guy's a phony.

11:00.643 --> 11:03.495
Full disclosure:
You go back five, six months,

11:03.497 --> 11:05.238
we were best friends
with the guy

11:05.240 --> 11:08.149
before he got famous
for those baby videos.

11:08.151 --> 11:10.985
Yeah, so many nights getting
blackout drunk with Homer.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.897
I don't remember him
mentioning that baby once.

11:13.899 --> 11:17.008
And I heard Maggie won't make
any more videos with him.

11:17.010 --> 11:21.179
What people been seeing
is all high-tech trickery.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.598
Intern Barney, play the clip.

11:27.746 --> 11:30.021
HOMER: Mmm.

11:30.023 --> 11:32.524
Oh, even fake Maggies
hate me.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.526
(laughing)

11:34.528 --> 11:35.676
You know, I'm thinking about

11:36.012 --> 11:38.196
going on the all-peanut diet.
You heard about this?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.698
Supposed to be great
for the adrenals.

11:39.700 --> 11:42.091
You know, the Aztecs,
that's all they ate was peanuts.

11:42.093 --> 11:44.035
Not like the crap we got today.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.854
Them ancient nuts,
they was full of that, uh, uh,

11:46.856 --> 11:48.431
niacinnamonites. Yeah.

11:48.433 --> 11:49.599
'Cause of the sand they had.

11:49.601 --> 11:51.768
And they lived to be a hundred,
200 years old.

11:51.770 --> 11:54.379
-(man groans)
-MOE: Same thing with
the Mayans and cashews...

11:54.381 --> 11:55.630
MAN:
Uh-uh.

11:58.868 --> 11:59.533
(mouse clicks)

11:59.535 --> 12:00.944
Hey, guys.

12:00.946 --> 12:03.388
We know there have been
a lot of rumors going around.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.615
So we wanted
to formally announce

12:05.617 --> 12:07.892
that we'll be making
a formal announcement

12:07.894 --> 12:10.061
tomorrow night on our livestream

12:10.063 --> 12:13.547
which will address
all the recent controversies.

12:13.549 --> 12:17.810
And we'll Cluck-Stop at nothing
to earn your trust back.

12:17.812 --> 12:18.962
(grunts)

12:18.964 --> 12:20.739
<i> FRINK:</i>
<i> That was nine days ago.</i>

12:20.741 --> 12:24.650
Nobody has seen or heard
from the Simpsons family since.

12:24.652 --> 12:27.487
Over the next two hours,
I will break down my theories

12:27.489 --> 12:31.065
on what might have caused
their dramatic disappearance

12:31.067 --> 12:34.586
on this special edition of...

12:34.588 --> 12:37.814
That's your cue.
This special edition of...

12:37.816 --> 12:38.998
<i> Frinkileaks.</i>

12:39.000 --> 12:41.634
Now play
the suspenseful music.

12:42.912 --> 12:45.913
No, that's a latte macchiato.

12:45.915 --> 12:48.007
(suspenseful music playing)

12:48.009 --> 12:51.585
Well, you might as well
finish my coffee now.

12:51.587 --> 12:53.563
(grunting)

13:03.341 --> 13:07.786
Which brings us once again
to Snowball I,

13:07.788 --> 13:10.013
which... (groans)

13:10.015 --> 13:12.682
Marker fumes. Oh, my.

13:12.684 --> 13:15.126
Hoyvik! Blarvlagin! Ivy.

13:15.128 --> 13:16.610
(clears throat)
I apologize.

13:16.612 --> 13:20.206
Um... in summary, I have
concluded that the Simpsons

13:20.208 --> 13:23.617
are being held hostage
by a major tech company.

13:23.619 --> 13:26.362
Now, I cannot
say which one, but, um,

13:26.364 --> 13:29.599
follow the Google Doodles.

13:31.460 --> 13:35.313
If, uh, you pause
right where the video glitches,

13:35.315 --> 13:37.464
you can see Homer
doesn't look human.

13:37.466 --> 13:41.060
More like an alien wearing
an ill-fitting human suit.

13:41.062 --> 13:42.303
Let me tell you something,

13:42.305 --> 13:45.064
Homer Simpsons has done more
for this country

13:45.066 --> 13:49.218
than Dr. Fauci
and Dr. Pimple Popper combined.

13:49.220 --> 13:52.055
It's not his fault
he has a trash son

13:52.057 --> 13:54.165
with a face
like a lunch bag, okay?

13:54.167 --> 13:58.061
Leave Homer Simpsons alone!
Leave him alone!

13:58.063 --> 14:00.338
(enunciating):
Welcome back to Patty...

14:00.340 --> 14:02.156
(enunciating):
And Selma's...

14:02.158 --> 14:04.417
BOTH:
Tingle Palace.

14:04.419 --> 14:07.236
We were going to do part four

14:07.238 --> 14:10.849
of our scalp-delousing
role-play.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.833
(tines riffling)

14:12.835 --> 14:14.835
But, in light of recent events,

14:14.837 --> 14:18.022
we're going to tell you what
we think happened to our

14:18.024 --> 14:22.193
sister Marge Simpson.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.438
(scales rubbing)

14:25.440 --> 14:29.092
It's pretty obvious
that Homer snapped,

14:29.094 --> 14:30.869
ate the whole family.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.537
and is hiding on a houseboat,

14:32.539 --> 14:35.948
in a cloud of belches
that used to be his wife

14:35.950 --> 14:37.542
and kids.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.027
(grunts)

14:40.029 --> 14:41.379
(scraping)

14:41.381 --> 14:43.623
-(man shudders)
-(mouse clicks)

14:43.625 --> 14:46.125
Hmm... hmm.

14:46.127 --> 14:47.534
What's up, guys?
Today we had

14:47.536 --> 14:50.446
a whole cemetery parkour
segment ready to go,

14:50.448 --> 14:53.299
but instead we've got
a big announcement.

14:53.301 --> 14:55.226
The location
of the Simpsons' mansion

14:55.228 --> 14:57.120
has always been super secret,

14:57.122 --> 14:58.471
but we figured out where it is.

14:58.473 --> 15:01.548
We found clues
in all their old videos.

15:01.550 --> 15:03.476
We're talking
regional birdsongs,

15:03.478 --> 15:06.129
town-specific
ice cream truck jingle.

15:06.131 --> 15:08.072
But the clincher:
my mom's dating a guy

15:08.074 --> 15:09.966
who got fired
from the post office,

15:09.968 --> 15:11.801
and he gave us their address.

15:11.803 --> 15:14.487
We're heading there tonight
to get some answers.

15:14.489 --> 15:16.230
But first, parkour.

15:16.232 --> 15:17.823
Parkour. (grunts)

15:17.825 --> 15:18.899
Beloved husband!

15:18.901 --> 15:20.660
Angel-baby!

15:20.662 --> 15:22.979
Jewish guy! Parkour!

15:22.981 --> 15:24.255
-(mouse clicks)
-MAN: Eh...

15:24.257 --> 15:25.164
-Huh.
-(mouse clicks)

15:25.166 --> 15:27.258
Hey, guys, I'm Shauna.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.318
With a freaking exclusive.

15:29.320 --> 15:31.487
I found the Simpsons mansion.

15:31.489 --> 15:34.657
What the hell, Jimbo?
Did you tell her the address?

15:34.659 --> 15:36.601
JIMBO:
Duh. She's my girlfriend. Hey...

15:38.438 --> 15:40.496
(grunting)

15:40.498 --> 15:42.941
MARTIN:
Martin Prince here, now embedded

15:42.943 --> 15:44.758
at the Simpsons family compound.

15:44.760 --> 15:48.095
SHAUNA:
We're about to get
scooped, dumb-wads.

15:48.097 --> 15:51.950
Hey, guys, Simpsons...
(speaking gibberish)

15:51.952 --> 15:53.267
Like and subscribe.

15:53.269 --> 15:54.844
-PATTY: Hey, guys.
-COMIC BOOK GUY: Hey, guys.

15:54.846 --> 15:56.770
-SHERRI AND TERRI: Hey, guys.
-MOE: Hey, guys.

15:56.772 --> 15:58.364
(gasps) It's a vlog swarm.

15:58.366 --> 16:01.033
No, no, no. This is our content.

16:01.035 --> 16:02.335
JIMBO:
Okay, okay.

16:02.337 --> 16:03.869
(Crazy Cat Lady
speaking gibberish)

16:03.871 --> 16:06.372
JIMBO:
But turn on that light.

16:06.374 --> 16:08.524
NELSON:
This way, come on.

16:08.526 --> 16:10.209
(all panting)

16:10.211 --> 16:11.803
Ha! Look at this.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.547
They obviously left in a hurry
without their phones.

16:14.549 --> 16:17.550
Shut up.
I can't hear myself Shauna.

16:18.886 --> 16:20.979
-Move out, people, let's go,
let's go, let's go.
-Come on, guys, let's go.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.055
(gasps)
Huh?

16:23.057 --> 16:25.891
(all shouting)

16:25.893 --> 16:26.818
-Hmm?
-What is this?

16:26.820 --> 16:28.802
(all grunt curiously)

16:28.804 --> 16:30.229
-(Simpsons gasp)
-I found 'em!

16:30.231 --> 16:31.547
Somebody get a pic!

16:31.549 --> 16:32.306
Bart, the door!

16:32.400 --> 16:34.534
-MARGE: Grab it!
-LISA: Get it!

16:36.997 --> 16:38.830
Welcome, Simpson family.

16:38.832 --> 16:42.558
So, nine days
in a panic room. Why?

16:42.560 --> 16:44.577
Well, Opal,
our house had been built

16:44.579 --> 16:47.321
by a company we partnered with
that, at that point,

16:47.323 --> 16:50.491
had only built NFTs of houses.
(chuckles)

16:50.493 --> 16:53.252
They installed
the panic room door backwards.

16:53.254 --> 16:55.629
You could get in,
but you can't get out.

16:55.631 --> 16:58.424
But how did you all
end up trapped there?

16:58.426 --> 17:01.927
Well, we'd been getting ready
for our redemption livestream,

17:01.929 --> 17:04.004
and we were all a little tense.

17:04.006 --> 17:06.173
So I went to the panic room,
where we stored

17:06.175 --> 17:07.841
all of our sponsored crap,

17:07.843 --> 17:10.010
to get some
children's CBD gummies.

17:10.012 --> 17:12.196
But I was already in there
pounding 'em.

17:14.442 --> 17:17.777
<i> MARGE: Then I ran in</i>
<i> and yelled, "Stop fighting.</i>

17:17.779 --> 17:19.428
<i> "You're going to sweat through</i>

17:19.430 --> 17:21.597

<i> BART:</i>
<i> But when we tried to leave,</i>

17:22.858 --> 17:23.949
<i> it was locked.</i>

17:23.951 --> 17:25.859
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> I said, "Nobody panic.</i>

17:25.861 --> 17:27.861
<i> There's got to be</i>
<i> a panic button."</i>

17:27.863 --> 17:29.455
<i> HOMER:</i>
<i> Then I walked in, saying,</i>

17:29.457 --> 17:31.365
<i> "Marge, I can't find</i>
<i> the fridge again."</i>

17:31.367 --> 17:33.276
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> We tried to grab the door.</i>

17:33.278 --> 17:34.460
But it was too late.

17:34.462 --> 17:37.538
We were trapped,
and it was all Homer's fault.

17:37.540 --> 17:40.132
What? You said
it was nobody's fault.

17:40.134 --> 17:42.042
That's what
I'm supposed to feel,

17:42.044 --> 17:43.710
but I'm not there yet.

17:43.712 --> 17:46.397
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> We survived on products</i>
<i> we'd been shilling</i>

17:46.399 --> 17:49.216
<i> but had never</i>
<i> actually eaten before.</i>

17:49.218 --> 17:51.143
Luckily, there was
also a huge supply

17:51.145 --> 17:53.387
of single-use hat-toilets.

17:53.389 --> 17:56.056
Uh, I'm pretty sure
those were just hats.

17:56.058 --> 17:58.301
We didn't have any way
to post content,

17:58.303 --> 18:01.454
<i> so we went through</i>
<i> pretty severe withdrawal.</i>

18:06.994 --> 18:09.312
<i> MARGE:</i>
<i>Then, sometime around day four,</i>

18:09.314 --> 18:11.089
<i> I said, "Where's Maggie?</i>

18:11.091 --> 18:13.174
<i>She was just here a second ago."</i>

18:14.652 --> 18:16.577

18:20.100 --> 18:22.842
<i> HOMER:</i>
<i> I said, "Maggie, come back."</i>

18:22.844 --> 18:26.495
<i> That I'd never force her</i>
<i> to do content ever again,</i>

18:26.497 --> 18:29.089

<i> She'd been in the cabinet</i>

18:34.689 --> 18:36.114
<i> We were so relieved.</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:39.433

<i> Then we realized how high up</i>

18:39.435 --> 18:41.677
<i> BART:</i>
<i>But Homer made an awesome catch.</i>

18:41.679 --> 18:42.845
<i> And Maggie barfed on him.</i>

18:42.847 --> 18:44.288
<i> (chuckles)</i>
<i> Classic.</i>

18:45.533 --> 18:48.793
<i> MARGE:</i>
<i> After that,</i>
<i> something strange happened.</i>

18:48.795 --> 18:51.370
<i> We started talking</i>

18:51.372 --> 18:54.132

<i> Like texting with our mouths.</i>

18:54.134 --> 18:55.708

<i> I'd almost forgotten</i>

<i> I could L-O-L I-R-L.</i>

18:58.379 --> 19:01.305

<i> It felt like we were</i>

19:01.307 --> 19:03.790
<i> LISA:</i>
<i> The only subscribers we needed</i>

19:03.792 --> 19:05.977
were in that room.

19:05.979 --> 19:07.961
Wow. Just, wow.

19:07.963 --> 19:11.390
We're shutting down
the YouTube channel

19:11.392 --> 19:14.560
because "The Simpson Family"
isn't who we are.

19:14.562 --> 19:17.380
We are the Simpsons.

19:17.382 --> 19:19.973
We are completely offline now.

19:19.975 --> 19:21.734
I don't even check
email anymore,

19:21.736 --> 19:24.495
but that's mainly 'cause we
moved back to Evergreen Terrace,

19:24.497 --> 19:28.499
and our neighborino changed
his Wi-Fi passwordily-durdily.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.001
Well, there you have it.

19:30.003 --> 19:32.336
A confusing, nonsense-word end

19:32.338 --> 19:34.988
to the meteoric rise and fall

19:34.990 --> 19:36.841
and disappearance
and reappearance

19:36.843 --> 19:38.843
and return to status quo

19:38.845 --> 19:40.994
for the family
the Internet could not

19:40.996 --> 19:43.330
get enough of
for almost half a year.

19:43.332 --> 19:45.090
Can we go look at your beehives?

19:45.092 --> 19:47.351
Nah, we're all done here.

19:47.353 --> 19:50.671
Well, that's four hours
of my life I'll never get back.

19:50.673 --> 19:54.600
WOMAN:
George R.R. Martin, you better
be working on that new book.

19:54.602 --> 19:56.027
I am.

19:56.029 --> 19:58.512
You said you would finish
it years ago.

19:58.514 --> 19:59.530
I'm gonna.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.425
They already made two TV shows
about it.

20:02.427 --> 20:05.594
I know that.
I went to the parties.

20:05.596 --> 20:08.764
No more parties until
you finish that book.

20:08.766 --> 20:10.041
I'm writing it right now.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.451
I'm... doing research.

20:12.453 --> 20:14.170
(typing)

20:15.715 --> 20:16.464
Oh.

20:17.866 --> 20:20.218
You did not just stick
your hands in the mint bowl.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.202
Girl, use the spoon,
or I'm gonna have to

20:22.204 --> 20:24.129
kick your
Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Booty.

20:24.131 --> 20:25.872
Bitch, that is
an IHOP reference.
