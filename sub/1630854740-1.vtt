Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:15.449 --> 04:18.110
You silly fucker, you've gone

04:18.210 --> 04:21.270
You're alright. You're alright.
Might need a medic. Logan's hit.

You're alright, mate.
Look at me, look at me.

Take it.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.490
And take the shot.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.970
I don't want to.

Oi, hold this.

07:01.369 --> 07:03.369
OK. Flat to the stone.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.249
And you're gonna pull it back.

07:09.448 --> 07:12.148
Come here. Try again.
Put the pressure on.

07:12.249 --> 07:14.249

All good.

It's OK.

Ready?

[soft piano music]

[laughter]

10:50.047 --> 10:52.406
Oh! [laughs]

11:04.527 --> 11:06.427
You have a good time today?

11:06.528 --> 11:08.528
-The best.
-Yeah?

11:14.247 --> 11:16.247
Ouch.

11:16.966 --> 11:18.966
Hmm.

11:20.287 --> 11:22.106
Did you eat some fish?

11:22.206 --> 11:23.986
No. Deer.

11:24.087 --> 11:25.186
So good.

11:25.287 --> 11:27.287
[laughs]

11:29.367 --> 11:31.367
[whirring noise]

11:46.087 --> 11:48.065
What happened to his finger?

11:48.165 --> 11:49.265
[motor stops]

11:49.366 --> 11:50.426
What was that?

11:50.527 --> 11:52.066
What happened to his finger?

11:52.166 --> 11:54.266
Oh, it's just a nick.

11:54.367 --> 11:56.547
He'll be fine.

11:56.647 --> 11:58.647
Hey.

12:00.166 --> 12:01.547
How are you feeling?

12:01.647 --> 12:03.066
-Fat.
-Yeah?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.266
Mm-hm.

12:04.367 --> 12:06.367
Want me to sand it
a little back?

12:08.887 --> 12:10.186
How are you doing in there?

12:10.287 --> 12:11.547
Doing OK? She's not moving.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.647
She's asleep.

12:14.246 --> 12:16.346
OK.

12:16.446 --> 12:19.886
That's a wonderful thought.
Sleep inside of you.

12:22.126 --> 12:24.126
How's it coming along?

12:25.606 --> 12:27.865
Yeah, it's good. Be finished
by the time she's 16.

12:27.965 --> 12:29.965
[laughs]

12:36.887 --> 12:38.887
Hey.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.726
Gotta go to bed.

12:43.367 --> 12:45.666
Did you have a good time
with me camping?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.766
Yeah.

12:48.327 --> 12:50.327
Yeah, I did too.

12:55.765 --> 12:57.765
What is it?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.446
Will I be brave like you
one day?

13:04.086 --> 13:06.086
Like me?

13:09.446 --> 13:11.446
There's many ways to be brave.

13:13.166 --> 13:15.166
Like…

13:15.965 --> 13:18.485
like remember when I told you
to shoot the deer, you said no?

13:20.966 --> 13:22.986
And when you said that,

13:23.087 --> 13:26.005
you were kind of scared that
you were gonna disappoint me.

13:27.606 --> 13:29.606
But you said it anyway.

13:30.886 --> 13:32.886
That's being brave.

13:38.446 --> 13:40.505
Get some sleep.

13:40.606 --> 13:42.224
Get some sleep.

13:42.324 --> 13:43.785
Ah, get in.

13:43.886 --> 13:45.886
Tuck you in like a burrito!

13:47.966 --> 13:49.385
[laughs] Ouch.

13:49.485 --> 13:51.485
It's hot.

13:52.126 --> 13:54.185
I heated it up a bit.

13:54.285 --> 13:56.366
[laughs]
Are you trying to cook me?

13:58.524 --> 14:00.524
-Like this?
-Yeah.

14:01.725 --> 14:03.344
And what is this meant to do
again?

14:03.445 --> 14:05.785
Um…

14:05.886 --> 14:07.966
supposed to prevent
stretch marks.

14:09.365 --> 14:10.825
Yeah, not working.

14:10.926 --> 14:12.926
Fuck you.

14:13.565 --> 14:14.905
OK here.

14:15.005 --> 14:17.246
[talks softly]

14:18.085 --> 14:20.225
[sighs]

14:20.325 --> 14:22.585
Shh.

14:22.686 --> 14:24.686
[talks softly]

14:43.445 --> 14:45.445
[kissing noise]

15:06.084 --> 15:08.364
[birds chirp softly]

15:11.925 --> 15:13.925
[soft music]

15:17.965 --> 15:19.624
Is it time to get up?

15:19.725 --> 15:21.584
[whispers] Sh…sh…
Mummy's asleep.

15:21.685 --> 15:24.104
OK. Come here. Come here.

15:24.205 --> 15:25.945
[whispers softly]

15:26.045 --> 15:27.303
Yeah. Cool. OK.

15:27.403 --> 15:29.544
Don't look.
What's in your sandwich?

15:29.644 --> 15:31.185
Jam?

15:31.285 --> 15:32.945
[snorts]

15:33.045 --> 15:34.464
[makes a chicken noise]

15:34.564 --> 15:36.565
[laughs]

15:37.884 --> 15:40.164
-Chicken?
-Yes!

15:46.444 --> 15:48.444
Remember what to do?

15:48.765 --> 15:50.944
Got to do it nice and gentle.
Nice and gentle.

15:51.045 --> 15:53.924
Squeeze it tight. Tight.
There you go! That's the one.

15:58.285 --> 16:00.285
[laughs softly]

16:01.285 --> 16:03.024
-Kelly?
-Nup.

16:03.124 --> 16:05.225
-Kelly, that's nice.
-Nup.

16:05.325 --> 16:06.344
Okay?

16:06.444 --> 16:07.864
-Um…
-Ah…

16:07.965 --> 16:09.263
Kiana.

16:09.363 --> 16:11.263
-Kiana?
-Yeah.

16:11.363 --> 16:12.663
-That's not a name.
-Yes it is.

16:12.764 --> 16:14.023
-You made it up.
-That's your friend--

16:14.123 --> 16:16.123
No, it's your friend
from netball.

16:16.723 --> 16:18.063
Kiana.

16:18.163 --> 16:21.944
The tall one. Goal…goalkeeper.
Goal attack. GA.

16:22.045 --> 16:23.584
Kiani.

16:23.684 --> 16:25.184
Not Kiana, Kiani.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.584
I've been calling her Kiana.

16:26.684 --> 16:28.904
Oh, that's her…
that's the wrong name.

16:29.005 --> 16:30.985
-Why hasn't she said anything?
-[laughs]

16:31.085 --> 16:32.904
Who calls themself Kiani?
What does that mean?

16:33.005 --> 16:35.264
Honey, you're such an asshole.

16:35.364 --> 16:36.624
Why am I an asshole?
She's the one…

16:36.725 --> 16:38.064
-This whole time?
-You'd think…

16:38.164 --> 16:40.304
My name… Sorry, you've
been calling me the wrong name.

16:40.404 --> 16:41.583
My name is Kiani.

16:41.683 --> 16:43.683
[laughs]

16:47.284 --> 16:50.084
[soft tender music]

16:53.364 --> 16:55.364
[sighs]

16:59.884 --> 17:01.884
[indistinct talking]

17:04.124 --> 17:06.124
[instructor shouting]

17:11.524 --> 17:13.524
[instructor shouting]

17:19.564 --> 17:22.364
You got any idea what you're
gonna say to these kids?

17:23.243 --> 17:24.783
I got no idea.

17:24.884 --> 17:26.663
[chuckles]

17:26.763 --> 17:28.983
Probably the same shit
you dribbled to me.

17:29.084 --> 17:31.084
Yeah.

17:31.644 --> 17:33.644
Just be honest, son.

17:35.644 --> 17:37.263
No, we're all just men.

17:37.364 --> 17:39.263
None of us is Superman.

17:39.364 --> 17:41.364
We're not made of steel.
We're not invincible.

17:42.283 --> 17:44.483
Just trying to walk a line
between courage and fear.

17:46.644 --> 17:48.623
Pure courage is…

17:48.723 --> 17:50.923
taking on a task
that you're ill equipped to do.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.384
The job of the instructors here

17:53.484 --> 17:55.463
is to equip you
for any situation

17:55.563 --> 17:57.263
you find yourself
in the field of duty.

17:57.364 --> 17:59.183
[indicator clicks]

17:59.283 --> 18:01.604
We minimise the fear
by the repetition of training.

18:05.644 --> 18:08.164
Pure courage is minimised…

18:08.924 --> 18:10.263
because it needs to be.

18:10.364 --> 18:12.624
Because in the face of fear
your actions and decisions

18:12.724 --> 18:14.183
can be compromised.

18:14.283 --> 18:17.463
[soft eerie music]

18:17.563 --> 18:19.104
And you're in near the end?
Right?

18:19.204 --> 18:20.782
-Right?
-[men] Yeah.

18:20.883 --> 18:22.883
Yeah.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.262
That's good.

18:24.362 --> 18:26.143
But we're still gonna push you
physically and mentally

18:26.243 --> 18:28.243
harder than you ever thought
possible.

18:28.723 --> 18:30.723
You just gotta keep your line.

18:31.362 --> 18:32.623
You just gotta keep the line.

18:32.723 --> 18:34.723
[tyres screech]

18:35.562 --> 18:37.563
[car horn drones]

18:41.724 --> 18:43.724
Just gotta try
and keep your line.

18:46.684 --> 18:47.863
That's it.

18:47.964 --> 18:49.964
[scattered applause]

18:56.963 --> 18:58.342
Mate, are you right?

18:58.443 --> 19:00.443
[groans]

19:02.602 --> 19:04.262
Ambulance. Yeah.

19:04.362 --> 19:06.562
[tense music]

19:08.443 --> 19:10.443
[breathes heavily]

19:18.602 --> 19:20.602
[exhales]
[music stops]

19:28.602 --> 19:31.763
[solemn music]

19:34.322 --> 19:36.322
[weeping]

19:53.763 --> 19:55.763
Just please don't go.

20:01.441 --> 20:03.441
When then?

20:11.083 --> 20:12.902
[sniffs]

20:13.003 --> 20:15.362
[solemn music continues]

20:20.963 --> 20:23.302
[woman] And just as a final
thought, Your Honour,

20:23.402 --> 20:24.782
I'd ask you to take into
consideration

20:24.882 --> 20:28.162
the upheaval this young man has
faced over the past seven years.

20:29.162 --> 20:31.021
He's been to six schools.

20:31.121 --> 20:33.362
Lived in Brisbane, Adelaide,
Perth and now here.

20:34.881 --> 20:37.061
And what are the reasons
for that?

20:37.161 --> 20:39.021
His father, Your Honour,
has had trouble finding

20:39.121 --> 20:41.161
fulfilling employment
since leaving the army.

20:43.961 --> 20:46.482
-Is your father here, son?
-Yes, Your Honour.

20:47.641 --> 20:49.641
Mr Logan?

20:50.441 --> 20:52.441
Yes, Your Honour?

20:54.962 --> 20:58.323
So did you see active service,
Mr Logan?

20:59.083 --> 21:00.182
Yes, Your Honour.

21:00.283 --> 21:03.681
Well, I had an uncle in the
Army, served in Vietnam…

21:05.882 --> 21:09.262
He…well, he struggled in
the years after.

21:09.362 --> 21:10.581
I'm fine, Your Honour.

21:10.681 --> 21:12.821
Now, hear me out, Mr Logan.

21:12.921 --> 21:14.861
Now, look, I have read over
your son's offences.

21:14.961 --> 21:18.141
Now this is the third time
that he's appeared here.

21:18.241 --> 21:22.461
It was stealing, drug possession
and now destruction of property.

21:22.562 --> 21:24.941
And all occasions he's been
picked up by the police

21:25.042 --> 21:26.621
after some days away
from your care,

21:26.721 --> 21:28.621
that being, he's run away.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.861
And I also read here
that his mother passed away

21:30.961 --> 21:32.961
eight years ago,
so it's only you?

21:35.921 --> 21:38.020
Yes, Your Honour.

21:38.121 --> 21:39.542
[exhales]

21:39.642 --> 21:41.861
Mr Logan, I sympathise with your
situation.

21:41.961 --> 21:43.861
I've seen your struggle
firsthand.

21:43.961 --> 21:45.861
You're also a single parent,

21:45.961 --> 21:48.101
but the situation with your son
is dire.

21:48.201 --> 21:51.261
And by that, I mean, if he
appears before this court again,

21:51.362 --> 21:53.882
he'll either be sent away
or taken from your care.

21:54.761 --> 21:55.941
Now that's the process.

21:56.042 --> 21:57.661
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

21:57.761 --> 21:59.761
Yes, Your Honour.

22:02.082 --> 22:04.082
And son, do you understand this?

22:05.961 --> 22:07.961
Yes, Your Honour.

22:09.280 --> 22:14.280
Good. You're free to go
Mr Logan.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.799
Thank you.
-Bow, bow.

22:26.481 --> 22:27.941

[school bell rings]

24:17.961 --> 24:21.280
[man] Missed 10 days
over one term.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.280
Does that sound right?

24:26.160 --> 24:28.160
Yeah.

24:30.960 --> 24:32.420
Billy…

24:32.520 --> 24:34.859
could you wait outside
for a moment?

24:34.960 --> 24:36.960
Thank you.

24:44.560 --> 24:46.560
[floorboards creak]

24:51.441 --> 24:53.180
[sighs]

24:53.280 --> 24:55.539
Mr Logan,
paying the amount of money

24:55.639 --> 24:56.899
that one does for school
like this

24:57.000 --> 24:59.000
doesn't guarantee anything.

25:00.159 --> 25:01.460
What do you mean?

25:01.560 --> 25:03.619
What I'm saying is…

25:03.720 --> 25:07.240
Billy could be just as well
suited to a good public school.

25:09.440 --> 25:10.899
You don't want him.

25:11.000 --> 25:13.059
It's not about what I want.

25:13.159 --> 25:15.879
He doesn't seem
to want to be here. Does he?

25:20.639 --> 25:22.639
Mr Logan…

25:23.280 --> 25:26.059
you haven't paid
last term's fees.

25:26.159 --> 25:29.639
All I'm saying is
there are good alternatives.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.419
He might be happier
at a public school.

25:33.520 --> 25:36.619
It might be better for him
and easier for you.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.879
I'll make sure that I pay
what's outstanding.

25:40.879 --> 25:42.879
And he won't miss
anymore school.

25:45.720 --> 25:47.720
[waves break]

25:55.399 --> 25:57.879
[solemn music]

26:11.480 --> 26:13.480
Hey, here he is!

26:19.520 --> 26:21.379
You look thin.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.260
-Do I?
-Yeah.

26:23.360 --> 26:25.579
What have you done
to your fucking hair?

26:25.679 --> 26:27.679
What you don't like this?

26:28.719 --> 26:30.898
Well, it's good on you.

26:30.998 --> 26:33.058
But I did try that, mate,
I looked like a fuckwit.

26:33.158 --> 26:35.158
[laughs]

26:37.639 --> 26:40.259
So you came home, eh, mate?

26:40.359 --> 26:43.058
Yeah. Better job.

26:43.158 --> 26:45.818
See her and, you know,
kid's in school.

26:45.918 --> 26:47.918
They're buried here.

26:49.158 --> 26:51.158
Well, it's really good to see
you, son.

26:56.360 --> 26:57.979
Billy good?

26:58.080 --> 27:00.080
How's Layla?

27:03.159 --> 27:05.159
Na, she sort of cut me off.

27:07.079 --> 27:09.679
She ended up fucking some bloke
she worked with.

27:10.958 --> 27:13.059
Big fat cunt.

27:13.159 --> 27:14.857
I followed him,
he's one of those guys

27:14.957 --> 27:17.618
that gets all dressed up
in lycra to ride his bike

27:17.718 --> 27:19.718
on a weekend.

27:21.278 --> 27:23.338
I nearly run the fucker over.

27:23.438 --> 27:25.478
-But you didn't?
-No I didn't, Corporal.

27:28.359 --> 27:31.258
Your daughters…
you had two of them?

27:31.359 --> 27:33.359
How are they doing?

27:36.477 --> 27:38.517
Ah, they don't talk to me.

27:39.878 --> 27:41.258
Sorry to hear that.

27:41.359 --> 27:43.359
No, what can you do?

27:46.119 --> 27:47.819
You know, I thought about
going back bush

27:47.919 --> 27:50.099
there for a little while,
you know, going home.

27:50.199 --> 27:52.199
Good idea. Why didn't ya?

27:53.319 --> 27:55.658
Me mum and dad died and then…

27:55.758 --> 27:57.758
there's no work.

27:58.079 --> 28:00.618
Me brother and me sister,
you know, them they…

28:00.718 --> 28:02.958
they fucked off, there's just
no one there I knew.

28:04.919 --> 28:07.958
What about your boy?
How old's he now?

28:10.358 --> 28:12.358
He's a teenager.

28:13.997 --> 28:16.338
Fuck. What's he like?

28:16.438 --> 28:18.098
Like a teenager.

28:18.198 --> 28:20.217
[laughs]

28:20.317 --> 28:22.297
Does he listen to you?

28:22.398 --> 28:23.497
[snorts]

28:23.598 --> 28:26.599
Nup, it's hard being a soldier,
when you're not a soldier.

28:27.599 --> 28:29.599
No cunt will listen to you.

28:30.758 --> 28:33.058
What are you doing for work?
What do you do?

28:33.159 --> 28:34.619
I'm a sales rep.

28:34.719 --> 28:36.719
[both laugh]

28:38.399 --> 28:40.099
Yeah…

28:40.199 --> 28:42.198
what about you? You…

28:43.037 --> 28:45.037
still doing the same thing?

28:47.077 --> 28:49.077
It's what we're good at,
Corporal.

28:50.958 --> 28:53.678
And I haven't got enough room in
my brain to learn other things.

28:55.517 --> 28:58.517
One of the reasons
I want to see you, son.

28:59.678 --> 29:00.977
Wanted to know
if you'd be interested

29:01.077 --> 29:03.077
in doing something with me.

29:05.517 --> 29:07.657
I need your help, son.

29:07.757 --> 29:09.757
Alright.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.578
So we can stop talking
this kind of shit now

29:12.679 --> 29:15.158
and talk about stuff
that really matters?

29:16.478 --> 29:19.697
Look, I need help.
One night, right?

29:19.797 --> 29:21.797
In and out. Zero rounds.

29:22.958 --> 29:24.958
That's it.

29:25.958 --> 29:27.958
Just fucking think about it.

Mate, you gotta stay awake.

30:19.637 --> 30:21.636
Hey buddy. You're doing well.

30:26.356 --> 30:29.156
Yeah, his pressure's 80 over 30.
His pulse's thready.

[static whines]

30:45.318 --> 30:47.718
[solemn music]

31:02.477 --> 31:04.477
You got shit in the corner of
your mouth.

31:05.916 --> 31:07.916
What's that?

31:11.237 --> 31:13.237
Nothing.

31:20.957 --> 31:22.957
[softly] 2009…

31:23.477 --> 31:27.416
It is for drinkers who enjoy
rich, mouth-fill…

31:27.517 --> 31:30.296
It's for drinkers who enjoy
a rich mouth-filling wine

31:30.396 --> 31:32.517
with plenty of fruit
and flavour.

Hey mate. Hi, I'm Ryan Logan,
I work for Playfords.

31:52.676 --> 31:53.896
I'm the new rep.

31:53.997 --> 31:55.456
Just thought I'd come by
introduce myself

31:55.557 --> 31:57.257
and get you to check out
some of the specials

31:57.357 --> 31:58.455
we've got this month.

31:58.556 --> 32:00.556
What happened
to the other bloke?

32:00.955 --> 32:02.955
Um… I dunno. Um…

32:04.156 --> 32:06.375
So we've got a sauvignon blanc,
right,

32:06.475 --> 32:10.016
earthy tones,
real leathery on the palate.

32:10.116 --> 32:12.176
Mate, you want to tell me about
the specials,

32:12.277 --> 32:14.376
you call in make an appointment,
it's how we do it.

32:14.476 --> 32:15.777
OK.

32:15.877 --> 32:18.317
What's a good day that I can
make an appointment?

32:21.077 --> 32:22.896
You make a phone call,
make an appointment.

32:22.996 --> 32:24.996
and then we get there.

32:29.357 --> 32:31.455
Is there someone else
I could talk to maybe?

32:31.556 --> 32:35.775
Because, you know, we've got
some great tempranillos,

32:35.876 --> 32:38.356
have you ever heard of them--
Just fuck off.

32:46.356 --> 32:47.775
Um…

32:47.876 --> 32:50.356
I'll just leave you with this.
thank you for your time.

[tense music builds]

33:20.876 --> 33:23.015
Now, you ever talk to me
that way again

33:23.116 --> 33:24.576
I'll cut you so deep
and so much

33:24.676 --> 33:25.975
you'll need a fucking team
of dress makers

33:26.076 --> 33:28.455
to put you back together,
do you understand?

33:28.555 --> 33:30.555
Yeah.

33:42.876 --> 33:46.856
This one time,
we had this Afghan,

33:46.956 --> 33:48.175
we were interrogating him.

33:48.275 --> 33:50.655
He was…Taliban.

33:50.755 --> 33:52.334
You know what that is?

33:52.436 --> 33:53.855
Yeah.

33:53.955 --> 33:56.015
Anyway, we had to…

33:56.115 --> 33:57.776
transport him
to another province,

33:57.876 --> 33:59.876
so the Afghan interpreter,
he fucks off.

34:00.716 --> 34:02.216
And I take the cuffs off
this fella

34:02.316 --> 34:04.455
so I can take him
to the helicopter.

34:04.555 --> 34:06.555
And gets his arms free…

34:06.916 --> 34:09.234
and first thing he does
he goes for my rifle.

34:12.354 --> 34:14.354
Fuck was I supposed to do?

34:17.995 --> 34:19.995
Did he die?

34:24.434 --> 34:26.434
Did my dad ever kill anyone?

34:30.636 --> 34:32.636
Your dad was a sniper, son.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.156
Hey…

34:39.076 --> 34:41.076
Your dad's a fucking hero.

34:41.955 --> 34:43.974
You understand?

34:44.074 --> 34:46.074
Yeah.

34:52.514 --> 34:55.395
Do you ever think about
the guy you killed?

35:00.275 --> 35:02.355
Oh…

35:03.275 --> 35:05.355
it's strange, you know, you…

35:09.435 --> 35:11.494
you kill someone and…

35:11.594 --> 35:13.975
after you wonder just how
the fuck your paths crossed,

35:14.075 --> 35:16.075
you know?

35:17.954 --> 35:20.635
How people get into situations
where someone's gonna die.

35:23.274 --> 35:24.774
It's always someone
you've never known,

35:24.874 --> 35:27.034
someone you don't know
a fucking thing about.

35:30.434 --> 35:32.254
And that poor cunt had never
seen me before that day,

35:32.354 --> 35:34.354
and I'm the one
that turned out his light.

35:36.715 --> 35:38.715
Just like that.

35:41.195 --> 35:43.354
Johnny.
Corporal.

35:45.394 --> 35:47.055
Hey.

35:47.155 --> 35:50.334
Talking to your young fella,
mate. He's all grown up.

35:50.434 --> 35:52.434
Yeah.

35:53.273 --> 35:55.273
Here.

35:56.874 --> 35:58.974
How'd you know where I lived?

35:59.074 --> 36:01.074
I had you under surveillance.

36:03.395 --> 36:05.254
You didn't give him a beer
did you?

36:05.355 --> 36:07.654
-No.
-Good.

36:07.754 --> 36:09.754
What do you want, Johnny?

36:13.395 --> 36:15.375
You know what I want, mate.

36:15.475 --> 36:17.475
[soft tense music]

36:19.915 --> 36:21.913
Just want to have a chat.

36:27.754 --> 36:29.214
He's a growing boy,
he's gotta eat.

36:29.314 --> 36:31.013
How about I meet you
down the pub?

36:31.114 --> 36:33.293
Yeah, yeah.

36:33.393 --> 36:35.393
Hey…

36:38.513 --> 36:40.453
really good to see you again,
son.

36:40.553 --> 36:42.674
Yeah.

36:45.155 --> 36:47.155
Should be proud, mate.

36:49.434 --> 36:51.574
[bottles clink]

36:51.675 --> 36:53.673
See you down there, brother.

37:00.954 --> 37:03.034
What was he talking to you
about?

37:04.034 --> 37:06.034
Nothin'.

37:07.113 --> 37:08.974
He's just…

37:09.074 --> 37:10.693
just telling me stories.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.434
[mournful music]

37:28.153 --> 37:30.154
Yo. You alright?

37:30.473 --> 37:32.473
Yeah, I'm good, son.

37:37.553 --> 37:40.893
John, I'm gonna pass.
I'm not interested in this.

37:40.993 --> 37:42.993
Whatever it is, you know,
it's not for me.

37:44.553 --> 37:46.933
Yeah OK. No Drama.

37:47.033 --> 37:49.033
OK.

37:51.073 --> 37:53.073
Hey…

37:55.033 --> 37:57.073
to be honest, I didn't expect
to hear that, Corporal.

38:00.073 --> 38:02.113
You forgotten about
Tony McManus?

38:05.593 --> 38:07.013
No.

38:07.113 --> 38:09.113
No.

38:09.672 --> 38:12.912
And I did that
'cause I love you.

38:15.153 --> 38:17.053
Because you're my brother

38:17.153 --> 38:19.153
and you'd done
the same thing for me.

38:20.994 --> 38:22.994
Wouldn't ya?

38:23.634 --> 38:25.634
Son?

38:28.673 --> 38:32.353
[soft tense music]

38:45.152 --> 38:47.813
[Justine] That felt good at
the bottle shop today, didn't it?

38:47.913 --> 38:49.913
[snorts softly]

38:59.153 --> 39:01.714
Who the fuck
did he think he was talking to?

48:05.069 --> 48:08.048
Mate, you cannot be talking to
customers like that.

48:08.148 --> 48:09.409
Can't be talking to anyone
like that.

48:09.509 --> 48:10.848
Do you understand that?

48:10.949 --> 48:12.208
Yes.

48:12.308 --> 48:14.668
Can I ask exactly what prompted
you to say something like that?

48:16.348 --> 48:18.549
It was just the way
that he spoke to me.

48:19.389 --> 48:21.387
[sighs] Like what?

48:24.147 --> 48:26.147
Like, I was…

just a…

48:30.027 --> 48:32.027
Yeah, I get it.

48:34.587 --> 48:37.327
Yeah mate, I've gotta be honest,
I just didn't see this coming.

48:37.427 --> 48:38.607
I mean, you haven't…

48:38.708 --> 48:40.967
you haven't set the world
on fire with your numbers,

48:41.067 --> 48:44.168
but your effort, mate,
your effort's been brilliant.

48:44.268 --> 48:46.047
Now, look, the shop owner…

48:46.147 --> 48:49.088
the shop owner will accept
an apology, right?

48:49.189 --> 48:51.249
Can you do that?
We apologise.

48:51.349 --> 48:53.588
We put it down to having
a bad day and we move on.

48:54.948 --> 48:56.948
Can you do that?

48:57.267 --> 48:59.407
Yeah.

48:59.508 --> 49:01.207
Yeah, I can apologise.

49:01.307 --> 49:03.767
But what I can't do is promise
you that I won't do it again

49:03.867 --> 49:05.327
if someone speaks to me
that way.

49:05.427 --> 49:07.008
You can't speak to people
like that

49:07.108 --> 49:09.108
with so fucking little respect.

49:18.148 --> 49:20.807
I'm sorry, Ryan, I can't.
Can't risk it, mate.

49:20.907 --> 49:23.287
Not after I've just warned you,
I'll end up without a job.

49:23.387 --> 49:25.387

51:26.227 --> 51:28.227
Wouldn't he be really strict?

51:30.627 --> 51:32.627
He's pretty useless now.

51:33.707 --> 51:35.707
Not like he used to be.

Well mate, you're a better man
than me.

53:21.346 --> 53:24.405
'Cause the last proper job I had
was selling fucking power tools.

win it

anything to me.

53:59.864 --> 54:02.904
Yeah, but I…
it's a bit embarrassing asking.

54:04.265 --> 54:06.265
I got something for you.

54:08.066 --> 54:10.106
I've got something you can
keep an eye on for me.

57:35.063 --> 57:37.203
I mean, boys said it was like
two fucking ninjas

57:37.303 --> 57:39.302
come through the joint.

57:42.742 --> 57:44.742
And you know, Ray.

57:46.943 --> 57:49.222
No.
You know fucking Ray.

57:50.343 --> 57:51.404
Alright, if you say so.

57:51.504 --> 57:53.623
Right, well he copped it. Dead.

57:55.424 --> 57:57.904
That's no fucking good is it…
Ned?

57:59.944 --> 58:02.424
Boys said the door were locked
too, so someone's picked that.

58:05.183 --> 58:07.163
Look, I'm just wondering…

58:07.263 --> 58:09.283
if you know anyone else
out there in the game,

58:09.384 --> 58:11.522
that's got the same skill set
as you?

58:11.623 --> 58:13.623
[laughs softly]

58:14.942 --> 58:17.042
I mean, it could have been you.

58:17.143 --> 58:19.762
You've been there before,
you know what's in there.

58:19.862 --> 58:21.602
Maybe you swiped the keys.

58:21.703 --> 58:22.842
We're not saying that, John.

58:22.942 --> 58:24.362
Man, that's exactly what
I'm fucking saying.

58:24.462 --> 58:27.842
Listen…
I didn't fucking take anything.

58:27.942 --> 58:30.082
I didn't go into
your fucking apartment,

58:30.183 --> 58:34.042
I didn't open any fucking safe,
I didn't pick any fucking lock.

58:34.143 --> 58:36.144
I work for you.

58:37.023 --> 58:38.124
Last I checked.

58:38.224 --> 58:39.923
Come on, Ned, are you gonna
trust this cunt?

58:40.023 --> 58:41.883
Fucking look at him!
Mate, I am telling you.

58:41.983 --> 58:44.242
Mate, I'm having a chat, right?

58:44.342 --> 58:46.602
I never liked Johnny.
I never fucking liked ya Johnny.

58:46.702 --> 58:48.162
-Fuck--
-We're having a beer.

58:48.262 --> 58:50.242
We're having a chat, alright?
Just relax.

58:50.342 --> 58:52.903
Fucking relaxed.
This is me relaxed.

58:55.103 --> 58:57.103
[Ryan] What are you doing?

58:59.063 --> 59:01.063
[Justine] This is how
you're taking care of it?

59:10.543 --> 59:13.142
[exhales slowly]

59:14.862 --> 59:16.321
[boy] Oh!

59:16.421 --> 59:18.421
[all exclaim]

59:21.902 --> 59:23.082
[Jesse] I'm driving.

59:23.183 --> 59:24.763
Bullshit, Jesse,
you had your turn.

59:24.863 --> 59:26.042
Why the fuck do you get
to decide?

59:26.142 --> 59:27.243
It's my dad's car.

59:27.343 --> 59:29.343
Are you up for it, Logan?

59:32.542 --> 59:33.962
Don't be a soft cock now, Logan.

59:34.062 --> 59:36.162
-Get the fuck in the car.
-What are you scared of mate?

59:36.263 --> 59:37.522
-Come on.
-Everyone's had their go.

59:37.622 --> 59:39.283
Get in the car.

59:39.383 --> 59:40.882
-Yeah, come on mate.
-Don't be a pussy.

59:40.982 --> 59:42.982
Get in there, mate!

59:43.743 --> 59:45.982
[hydraulic noises]

59:46.942 --> 59:49.662
[upbeat hip hop music]

[solemn music]

1:00:05.861 --> 1:00:07.862
Please don't say anything.

1:00:12.063 --> 1:00:14.342
[phone ringing]

1:00:18.942 --> 1:00:20.942
Oh Billy.

1:00:21.902 --> 1:00:24.342
Slow down. Where are you?

1:00:28.742 --> 1:00:31.581
[soft tense music]

1:00:40.302 --> 1:00:41.762

[car door closes]

1:00:55.702 --> 1:00:57.082
You OK?

1:00:57.182 --> 1:00:59.182
Yeah.

1:01:07.622 --> 1:01:10.502
[solemn music]

1:01:15.702 --> 1:01:17.702
What are you gonna do?

1:01:19.142 --> 1:01:21.142
Are you gonna go to the cops?

1:01:22.542 --> 1:01:24.542
[scoffs]

1:01:25.142 --> 1:01:27.321
Dad's fucking gonna kill me.

1:01:27.421 --> 1:01:29.400
Look at it, it's fucked.

1:01:29.500 --> 1:01:31.500
I'm sorry.

1:01:32.140 --> 1:01:34.140
[boy] We're in so much shit.

1:01:36.862 --> 1:01:39.282
It's fine, we were
just passengers.

1:01:39.382 --> 1:01:41.081
Billy was driving.

1:01:41.181 --> 1:01:45.302
[solemn music]

1:01:53.021 --> 1:01:55.021
Sit down.

1:02:02.621 --> 1:02:04.920
-Did anyone see you?
-No.

1:02:05.020 --> 1:02:07.601
No one came by?
-No.

1:02:07.701 --> 1:02:10.480
-No? Whose car is it?
-It's my dad's car.

1:02:10.581 --> 1:02:12.581
Anyone know you got it?

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:17.500
Who was drinking?

1:02:28.421 --> 1:02:30.421
Were you drinking?

1:02:31.461 --> 1:02:33.461
[solemn music]

1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:45.881
I was drinking, Dad.

1:02:45.981 --> 1:02:49.220
[tense music]

1:03:02.421 --> 1:03:04.421
Get in the car.

1:03:15.860 --> 1:03:18.661

[sobs]

1:03:54.101 --> 1:03:56.101
[Ryan] Billy! Unlock the door!

1:03:57.220 --> 1:03:59.220
Billy!

1:04:00.501 --> 1:04:02.240
Open the door!

1:04:02.340 --> 1:04:05.001
-No!
-Open the door now!

1:04:05.101 --> 1:04:07.101
Fuck off!

1:04:14.860 --> 1:04:18.240
[solemn music]

1:04:18.340 --> 1:04:20.399
[softly] Hey.

1:04:20.499 --> 1:04:23.300
Hey. Look at me. Look at me.

1:04:25.180 --> 1:04:26.879
OK.

1:04:26.979 --> 1:04:28.979
OK.

1:04:29.539 --> 1:04:32.799
[solemn music]

1:04:32.899 --> 1:04:35.340
[engine idles]

1:04:58.580 --> 1:05:01.859
[solemn music continues]

1:05:16.339 --> 1:05:20.739
[mournful music]

1:05:42.139 --> 1:05:44.199
[man] Yeah, mate, yeah.
About seven.

1:05:44.300 --> 1:05:46.300
Righto.

1:05:48.139 --> 1:05:50.659
-Can I help you?
-I'm Ryan Logan, Billy's dad.

1:05:53.699 --> 1:05:55.478
Right.

1:05:55.579 --> 1:05:57.158
You better come in then.

1:05:57.258 --> 1:06:00.298
[solemn music]

1:06:05.218 --> 1:06:07.218
[glass clinks]

1:06:08.700 --> 1:06:10.700
You were in the army
my son tells me?

1:06:14.020 --> 1:06:16.839
-Yeah.
-You serve in Iraq?

1:06:16.939 --> 1:06:18.959
Yeah.

1:06:19.060 --> 1:06:21.140
Well, we shouldn't have fucking
been there, should we?

1:06:26.339 --> 1:06:28.339
So, where's my car?

1:06:29.498 --> 1:06:31.498
I burned it.

1:06:32.859 --> 1:06:34.118
I beg your pardon?

1:06:34.218 --> 1:06:35.839
I burned it, it was a write-off.

1:06:35.939 --> 1:06:37.939
Figured you'd have insurance.

1:06:39.259 --> 1:06:42.259
So you want me to say
it was stolen and then torched?

1:06:48.419 --> 1:06:50.498
Do you know what I do
for a living, soldier?

1:06:52.178 --> 1:06:54.158
I'm a solicitor.

1:06:54.258 --> 1:06:58.059
Principal at a law firm.
Very fucking prestigious one.

1:06:59.418 --> 1:07:00.958
Do you have any idea
what would happen

1:07:01.059 --> 1:07:02.758
if I made a false
insurance claim

1:07:02.858 --> 1:07:04.938
like the one you've set me up
to make?

1:07:05.938 --> 1:07:08.158
And upon the mandatory
investigation of the claim,

1:07:08.258 --> 1:07:10.258
it was found to be fraudulent…

1:07:11.258 --> 1:07:13.258
I could go to jail.

1:07:14.059 --> 1:07:16.498
At the very least I wouldn't be
practicing law ever again.

1:07:25.938 --> 1:07:28.378
My son said your boy's
a fucking ratbag.

1:07:30.498 --> 1:07:31.878
OK.

1:07:31.978 --> 1:07:33.978
He's already been in trouble
with the cops.

1:07:36.418 --> 1:07:38.318
Yeah.

1:07:38.418 --> 1:07:40.419
Your boy…

1:07:40.939 --> 1:07:42.939
he was pissed.

1:07:43.499 --> 1:07:45.399
They were all drinking.

1:07:45.499 --> 1:07:46.839
Yeah, they might have been
drinking,

1:07:46.939 --> 1:07:48.798
but they didn't get behind
the fucking wheel of a car,

1:07:48.899 --> 1:07:50.278
did they?

1:07:50.379 --> 1:07:52.379
My car.

1:07:53.499 --> 1:07:55.499
Yeah.

1:07:58.857 --> 1:08:00.857
You need this to go away?

1:08:03.697 --> 1:08:05.697
Please.

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:18.458
Sorry, I can't help you.

1:08:19.258 --> 1:08:21.617
To claim on my insurance,
I need to be honest.

1:08:23.617 --> 1:08:25.598
But here's some free counsel.

1:08:25.698 --> 1:08:26.919
As far as the fire goes,

1:08:27.019 --> 1:08:29.279
I'd let that fall on
your son's shoulders.

1:08:29.379 --> 1:08:31.118
Sounds like he's in
enough trouble already.

1:08:31.219 --> 1:08:33.337
and there's no upside
in you admitting to that.

1:08:37.618 --> 1:08:39.558
OK, so the police
are gonna be involved?

1:08:39.658 --> 1:08:41.658
Of course.

1:08:42.258 --> 1:08:44.258
What if I pay for the car?

1:08:46.938 --> 1:08:49.038
[scoffs]

1:08:49.138 --> 1:08:51.138
Do you know what a car like that
is worth?

1:08:51.738 --> 1:08:53.738
[chuckles softly]

1:08:56.258 --> 1:08:58.618
I'll get you the money and then
you just leave it alone.

1:09:02.417 --> 1:09:04.417
Yeah?

1:09:05.256 --> 1:09:07.657
You get me the money,
we'll see what we'll see.

1:09:09.058 --> 1:09:11.858
In the meantime, tell your boy
to find some new friends.

1:09:13.257 --> 1:09:15.938
I don't need my son
hanging around with trouble.

1:09:27.257 --> 1:09:29.257
Just give me a couple of days.

1:09:29.698 --> 1:09:31.598
Thank you for your time.

1:09:31.698 --> 1:09:34.238
[solemn music]

1:09:34.338 --> 1:09:36.378

1:10:15.257 --> 1:10:17.276
[footsteps]

1:10:17.377 --> 1:10:20.757
Hey. Hey, come here, son.

1:10:20.857 --> 1:10:23.157
Alright, just take a breath.

1:10:23.257 --> 1:10:25.837
Look at me. Just take a breath,
you'll be alright.

1:10:25.937 --> 1:10:27.236
-OK?
-Yep.

1:10:27.337 --> 1:10:29.337
I got you. You understand?

1:10:34.736 --> 1:10:36.196
Mr Logan.

1:10:36.297 --> 1:10:37.757
Yeah?

1:10:37.857 --> 1:10:39.878
Mr Logan, your wife and your son

1:10:39.978 --> 1:10:42.317
are both in
the RH null blood group.

1:10:42.418 --> 1:10:44.417
There's no RH antigens.

1:10:44.897 --> 1:10:46.317
Yeah, that's right.

1:10:46.417 --> 1:10:48.237
So you're aware of what
the problems with that are?

1:10:48.337 --> 1:10:50.157
Yeah, they give blood
all the time.

1:10:50.257 --> 1:10:52.036
They have to. It's here.

1:10:52.137 --> 1:10:53.237
So there's not enough blood.

1:10:53.337 --> 1:10:55.956
There's some on the way,
but we don't have enough time.

1:10:56.057 --> 1:10:57.237
They're both bleeding internally

1:10:57.337 --> 1:10:59.757
and your son has ruptured
his spleen.

1:10:59.857 --> 1:11:01.197
Your wife…

1:11:01.297 --> 1:11:03.157
she's lost the baby.

1:11:03.257 --> 1:11:04.317
OK.

1:11:04.417 --> 1:11:06.557
And she has severe
head injuries.

1:11:06.657 --> 1:11:09.937
She's bleeding from her liver
from her entire gut.

1:11:11.417 --> 1:11:13.417
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

1:11:17.056 --> 1:11:19.976
Yeah, well, give them the blood.
How is the baby?

1:11:21.696 --> 1:11:22.916
The baby's died. OK?

1:11:23.016 --> 1:11:25.236
So there's not enough blood
for both of them.

1:11:25.336 --> 1:11:27.336
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

1:11:29.457 --> 1:11:31.457
Yep.

1:11:32.137 --> 1:11:34.137
OK.

1:11:41.657 --> 1:11:43.997
[music builds and stops]

1:11:44.097 --> 1:11:46.097
Dad?

1:11:46.497 --> 1:11:47.597
Dad?

1:11:47.697 --> 1:11:49.955
Yeah. [sniffs]

1:11:50.055 --> 1:11:51.995
-I'm finished.
-Good to go?

1:11:52.095 --> 1:11:54.095
Yeah.

1:12:05.055 --> 1:12:07.055
It's Mum who you talk to,
isn't it?

1:12:17.697 --> 1:12:19.117
Wish I could talk to her.

1:12:19.217 --> 1:12:23.096
[solemn music]

1:12:27.576 --> 1:12:29.576
I miss her.

1:12:33.496 --> 1:12:35.616
[seagull squawks]
[waves rush]

1:12:38.935 --> 1:12:40.315
I gotta find another place
to drink,

1:12:40.416 --> 1:12:42.395
every fucker looking at me
like I've got three heads.

1:12:42.496 --> 1:12:44.496
I need more money, John.

1:12:48.696 --> 1:12:50.156
Alright, son,
whatever I can help you with.

1:12:50.256 --> 1:12:52.156
It's not a small amount.

1:12:52.256 --> 1:12:54.554
-How much?
-Couple hundred thousand.

1:12:54.654 --> 1:12:56.155
I don't even know
if I can pay you back.

1:12:56.256 --> 1:12:58.856
It was something Billy did
and I need to…

1:12:59.896 --> 1:13:01.356
Sh sh sh.

1:13:01.456 --> 1:13:04.176
Hey, I don't need to know.

1:13:13.136 --> 1:13:15.136
Corporal…

1:13:16.695 --> 1:13:18.695
there's a way to get this done.

1:13:20.336 --> 1:13:24.256
But you have to engage.
You understand?

1:13:27.935 --> 1:13:29.515
So you let me know, son.

1:13:29.615 --> 1:13:31.035
I'm here.

1:13:31.135 --> 1:13:34.354
