01:29.881 --> 01:31.841
(exhales playfully)

01:31.883 --> 01:34.511
(baby giggling, babbling)

01:40.392 --> 01:42.268
(chuckles softly)

01:45.480 --> 01:47.774
(baby babbling)

01:57.826 --> 01:59.577
(door squeaks)

02:02.622 --> 02:05.166
(babbling continues)

02:07.961 --> 02:10.422

02:10.463 --> 02:12.716
(soft rumbling)

(slow, quiet clicking)

03:50.605 --> 03:52.649
(lighter clicking)

03:59.989 --> 04:01.783
Where'd you find that?

04:02.784 --> 04:04.619
Promise you'd quit.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.497
Yeah. Yeah, it's not so easy,
you know.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.334
ANDY: Wait, why are you awake,
Charlie?

04:11.376 --> 04:12.627
CHARLIE:
Bad dream.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.507
Me, too.

04:17.549 --> 04:19.968
(sighs)
Do you want to talk about it?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.346
Put that down, please.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.974
Come on, that's not a toy.

04:26.016 --> 04:27.809
Come on.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.900
-(sighs)
-(sets lighter down)

04:38.528 --> 04:39.988
What's going on, sweetie?

04:42.615 --> 04:44.451
Daddy?

04:44.492 --> 04:46.536
Hmm?

04:46.578 --> 04:48.580
Something feels weird.

04:49.998 --> 04:51.624
In my body.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.752
I think we should go talk
to your mom about this.

04:53.793 --> 04:54.919
Uh, you know.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.963
Not that thing.

04:57.005 --> 04:59.966
-The other thing.
-The other thing.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.429
The bad thing.

05:04.471 --> 05:06.723
Something's changing.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.019
(breathes deeply)

05:11.061 --> 05:13.646
You remember your tools?

05:13.688 --> 05:16.024
If you ever get nervous,
if you're ever scared...

05:19.069 --> 05:21.738
...you start to lose control,
what do you do?

05:21.780 --> 05:24.491
(breathes deeply)

05:25.658 --> 05:26.785
Flowers.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.874
Clock.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.417
(ticking)

05:35.585 --> 05:38.588
See, uh, forest.

05:38.630 --> 05:39.964
CHARLIE:
Bunny.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.093
And sweet Charlie.

05:43.134 --> 05:45.845
The bad thing...

05:45.887 --> 05:48.014
it's been gone a long time.

05:49.057 --> 05:50.517
You're strong, Charlie.

05:50.558 --> 05:52.602
So you don't have to be afraid.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.689
(whispers):
All right.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.524
VICKY:
Hey. Is everything okay in here?

05:57.565 --> 05:59.734
Yeah. Yeah.

05:59.776 --> 06:00.944
Peachy.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.576
(Andy sighs)

06:09.911 --> 06:11.913
(Andy groans)

06:12.914 --> 06:14.874
I'm really hungry.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.668
Who wants pancakes?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.920
Pancakes?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.547
You want pancakes?

06:20.588 --> 06:23.049
-I want pancakes.
-No, you don't like pancakes.

06:23.091 --> 06:24.926
(Charlie chuckles)

06:25.885 --> 06:27.679
Blueberries, what else?
Chocolate?

06:27.721 --> 06:28.930
-Mm-hmm.
-Chocolate?

06:28.972 --> 06:30.557
-Yeah.
-What else do you want?

06:30.598 --> 06:31.766
Um...

06:32.934 --> 06:34.728
-Strawberries.
-VICKY: Coffee.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.688
-ANDY: Coffee? Black coffee?
-CHARLIE: Orange juice.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.733

-* *

06:39.774 --> 06:43.069
(VCR whirring, clicking)

06:45.864 --> 06:47.115
WANLESS:
Thank you so much

06:47.157 --> 06:48.700
-for coming in today.
-ANDY: Mm-hmm.

06:48.742 --> 06:51.077
How are you enjoying college
so far?

06:51.119 --> 06:54.247
(clicks tongue)
Uh... I'm having fun.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.042
It's busy. Kind of more work
than I thought.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.251
I'm kind of homesick.

06:58.293 --> 06:59.753
WANLESS:
I'm just gonna ask you

06:59.794 --> 07:01.087
a few questions here.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.214
-It's kind of background stuff.
-Okay.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
Ever used hallucinogenic drugs?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.760
Too scared.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.636
Uh...

07:08.678 --> 07:11.598
I mean, it's college, man.
You know?

07:11.639 --> 07:13.558
WANLESS: How about
your father's blood type?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.477
VICKY: Do you know
your parents' blood types?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.604
WANLESS: You know what?
I don't. Fair enough.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.065
Where do your parents live?

07:20.106 --> 07:22.859
They don't.
They died when I was ten.

07:22.901 --> 07:24.611
WANLESS: Says here you were
raised in a group home.

07:24.652 --> 07:26.112
Is that correct?

07:26.154 --> 07:29.115
Indeed, I was, uh,
from the time that I was seven.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.658
MAN:
Numbers are in the threshold,

07:30.700 --> 07:31.785
but let's keep an eye on it.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.036
WANLESS:
Telekinetic spikes.

07:33.078 --> 07:34.245
MAN:
Confirming here, too.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.622
VICKY:
Why do you need to know

07:35.663 --> 07:36.956
so much about my parents?

07:36.998 --> 07:38.708
WANLESS:
Genetic history.

07:38.750 --> 07:42.128
It helps us understand
and evaluate the test results.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.714
MAN: Slightly erratic,
but, uh, it's okay.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.257
WOMAN: We need to drop
his levels to five...

07:46.299 --> 07:49.594
The ad said that this was
just an FDA clinical trial.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.680
* *

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
WANLESS: Half of the people
will be getting

07:55.308 --> 07:58.853
injections of water, and
the other half will get water

07:58.895 --> 08:02.899
mixed with a chemical compound
that we call "Lot Six."

08:02.941 --> 08:04.651
A chemical compound?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.653
-Like what? What is it?
-(static whines)

08:08.863 --> 08:11.199
But half of us are just
gonna get the placebo, right?

08:11.241 --> 08:13.576
WANLESS: Either way,
it's entirely harmless.

08:13.618 --> 08:15.203
Well, how do you know?

08:15.245 --> 08:17.205
I mean, that's why
you're testing it, right?

08:20.375 --> 08:22.585
* *

08:24.087 --> 08:26.589
WANLESS: My next question here
is a little weird.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.258
Can you tell me
if you've ever had

08:28.299 --> 08:31.553
what you would call
an authentic psychic experience?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.682
I'd rather not talk about that.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.183
MAN:
Okay, let's make sure

08:37.225 --> 08:38.893
we're recording
her numbers here.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.062
(papers rustling)

08:42.313 --> 08:44.065
Confirmed telekinetic activity.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.192
I don't like
these questions, man.

08:46.234 --> 08:48.862
(chuckles)

08:48.903 --> 08:51.656
WANLESS:
Just part of the evaluation.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.700
Let me ask you again.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.620
Have you ever experienced
any inexplicable phenomena

08:57.662 --> 09:00.832
that goes against natural law?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.251
I saw my parents die
in a car wreck.

09:03.293 --> 09:06.588
WANLESS:
I'm sorry to hear that.

09:06.629 --> 09:09.090
But what about that
makes it inexplicable?

09:09.132 --> 09:11.593
I saw it a week before
it actually happened.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.136
-(static crackles)
-MAN: The readings are erratic!

09:13.178 --> 09:14.387
WANLESS:
Turn it off.

09:14.429 --> 09:16.306
WOMAN:
We need to unhook him now!

09:16.348 --> 09:18.016
-WANLESS: Turn that camera off!
-(monitor beeping, flatlining)

09:18.058 --> 09:20.268
-(scientists clamoring)
-(woman sobbing loudly)

09:20.310 --> 09:22.062
-WANLESS: Get him out of here.
-I still see it.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.147
(people screaming, clamoring)

09:24.189 --> 09:26.066
MAN:
Hold him down!

09:26.107 --> 09:27.859
WANLESS:
Turn it off. Turn it off!

09:27.901 --> 09:29.944
* *

09:31.780 --> 09:32.989
(VCR clicks)

09:36.242 --> 09:39.329
ANDY: My service guarantees
that after just three sessions,

09:39.371 --> 09:41.998
your nicotine cravings
will disappear.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.958
And all we do is talk?

09:45.126 --> 09:46.878
Sounds crazy, right?

09:47.837 --> 09:49.005
It's not.

09:50.006 --> 09:52.676
-It's magic.
-(chuckles) Okay.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.885
Uh, uh, I don't know, Mr. McGee.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.428
Well, call me Andy.

09:55.470 --> 09:58.807
Andy, uh, a hundred dollars
per session...

09:58.848 --> 10:00.058
(inhales deeply)

10:00.100 --> 10:01.768
Yeah, that's a lot
for my budget.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.144
Let's just try it.

10:03.186 --> 10:04.437
One session.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.897
If you don't
walk out of here today

10:05.939 --> 10:07.440
feeling better than
you've ever felt,

10:07.482 --> 10:09.275
with these nicotine cravings
already starting to fade,

10:09.317 --> 10:10.902
it's on the house.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.904
Now, close your eyes.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.407
(exhales heavily)

10:16.783 --> 10:18.702
Keep 'em closed.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.120
Good.

10:20.161 --> 10:22.956
Now, imagine the Darla
that you want to be.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.875
Picture her.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.210
Smoke-free.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.170
(soft rumbling)

10:29.212 --> 10:32.173
A beacon of respiratory health.

10:36.720 --> 10:38.805
Now look at me in the eyes.

10:38.847 --> 10:41.474
* *

10:41.516 --> 10:44.144
Don't look away.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.895
No matter what.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.107
(high-pitched ringing)

10:49.149 --> 10:51.151
You feel better about
yourself already, Darla.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.694
-(echoing): Healthier.
-(pupil squelching)

10:52.736 --> 10:54.154
More positive. Healthier.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.989
You hate the taste of tobacco.
More positive.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.992
And that stale cigarette smell
makes you want to puke.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.994
(heartbeat pulsing)

11:01.036 --> 11:04.831
You are done with smoking.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.958
(soft whoosh)

11:07.000 --> 11:09.419
(high-pitched ringing)

11:12.881 --> 11:15.300
-(ringing fades)
-(chuckles) You know,

11:15.342 --> 11:16.843
I...

11:16.885 --> 11:18.887
I feel better already.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.348
(whispers):
What?

11:21.389 --> 11:23.099
-(clears throat)
-Wow.

11:23.141 --> 11:25.810
Healthier, more positive.

11:25.852 --> 11:28.313
(laughs)

11:28.355 --> 11:30.357
-Wow.
-Mm-hmm. (chuckles)

11:30.398 --> 11:32.359
Okay, um...

11:32.400 --> 11:35.737
Okay, I have 75, but I can...

11:35.779 --> 11:37.447
I can give you
a credit card if you...

11:37.489 --> 11:39.407
No, it's-it's cash only,
so that's fine.

11:39.449 --> 11:41.451
-I'll just take
what you have now. -Oh.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.203
-Yeah? -Yeah. I'm sure
you're good for the rest.

11:43.244 --> 11:45.830
-Oh. I am indeed.
-(chuckles)

11:45.872 --> 11:46.831
Thank you.

11:46.873 --> 11:47.916
(both chuckle)

11:47.957 --> 11:49.501
(whispers):
Wild.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.339
(chuckles) Take care.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.760
* *

11:58.802 --> 12:00.887
-(door closes)
-(exhales sharply)

12:02.222 --> 12:05.183
(pained grunting and breathing)

12:12.440 --> 12:14.442
(shallow panting)

12:22.909 --> 12:25.036
(students chattering quietly)

12:28.456 --> 12:29.541
GAVIN:
Ew!

12:29.582 --> 12:31.126
Nice work, goober.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.255
MS. GARDNER: How is it going
over here, Gavin?

12:35.296 --> 12:38.049
-Weird girl killed our frog.
-It was already dead.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.093
Yeah, but now it's extra dead.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.178
MS. GARDNER:
That's okay, Charlie.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.097
A quick Google search

12:44.139 --> 12:46.474
will show you all the frog guts
you want dissected perfectly.

12:46.516 --> 12:48.977
We don't even need
to do this anymore.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.311
I don't have Google.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.147
(students laughing)

12:52.188 --> 12:53.481
(snorts)

12:53.523 --> 12:56.192
Quiet, class.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.112
(whispers):
I forgot. Sorry.

12:59.154 --> 13:00.947
You ever go
to the public library?

13:00.989 --> 13:03.074
You can use the computers there.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.577
Too much screen time can cause
health problems in children,

13:05.618 --> 13:06.619
like insomnia.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.375
I think a little screen time
would be just fine.

13:12.417 --> 13:13.626
Help with your grades, too.

13:13.668 --> 13:15.211
Okay.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.380
Now that we dissected our frogs,

13:17.422 --> 13:19.382
let's go back to the diagram

13:19.424 --> 13:20.967
and compare it with what we saw.

13:21.009 --> 13:22.552
-Now, notice the liver...
-(quietly): Hey.

13:22.594 --> 13:26.931
Is it true that Amish families
share the same bathwater?

13:26.973 --> 13:29.225
'Cause that's weird.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.269
And you're weird.

13:31.311 --> 13:34.481
-(soft rumbling)
-(Ms. Gardner's voice fading)

13:37.984 --> 13:38.985
Notebook.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.070
Pencil.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.321
Desk.

13:41.363 --> 13:42.447
Shoes.

13:43.448 --> 13:44.491
Paper.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.950
(soft whooshing)

13:45.992 --> 13:47.160
Eraser.

13:47.202 --> 13:48.203
-Calculator.
-(whooshing stops)

13:48.244 --> 13:49.412
Everything okay, Charlie?

13:52.040 --> 13:54.125
Yes, Ms. Gardner.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.211
(birds chirping)

14:00.465 --> 14:03.093
(breathing shakily)

14:04.636 --> 14:07.430
(quiet knocking)

14:07.472 --> 14:09.182
-(gasps)
-(door opens)

14:11.059 --> 14:13.645
Charlie.

14:13.687 --> 14:15.563
Is everything okay in here?

14:17.065 --> 14:18.525
-(sniffles)
-(door closes)

14:20.735 --> 14:23.405
I don't want to go to school.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.949
(breathes deeply)

14:25.990 --> 14:27.367
(grunts)

14:29.035 --> 14:31.079
We just want you
to have a normal life.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.289
I want stupid Wi-Fi.

14:33.331 --> 14:35.375
That's normal.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.419
(crying softly)

14:39.045 --> 14:41.089
That stuff rots your brains.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.552
Do you really believe that?

14:45.593 --> 14:47.095
Mm-hmm.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.474
Plus, it's expensive, you know?

14:51.516 --> 14:55.103
Monthly bills, smartphones.

14:55.145 --> 14:58.440
We just, you know...
we can't afford it right now.

14:59.524 --> 15:01.067
Sorry.

15:02.485 --> 15:04.404
It happened again.

15:08.283 --> 15:10.076
The bad thing.

15:11.619 --> 15:13.163
This boy made fun of me.

15:15.040 --> 15:15.999
(breath trembling)

15:16.041 --> 15:17.959
He called me weird.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.462
You're not weird.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.130
(whispers):
I'm worse.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.716
No. No.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.968
You're special.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.262
(sniffles)

15:29.304 --> 15:32.974
I knew it
the day that you were born.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.604
You were warm and toasty
like a buttery muffin.

15:38.772 --> 15:40.982
* *

15:43.693 --> 15:44.778
VICKY:
Hmm?

15:44.819 --> 15:47.530
Are you scared of me?

15:47.572 --> 15:49.491
(sighs)

15:51.034 --> 15:53.620
(whispers): I could never
be scared of you.

15:54.579 --> 15:56.623
Come here.

15:59.793 --> 16:01.461
(sighs)

16:07.759 --> 16:09.302
Three years.

16:09.344 --> 16:11.137
We got... (sighs)
we got too comfortable.

16:11.179 --> 16:13.264
ANDY: I just don't get it.
Like, why now?

16:13.306 --> 16:15.141
What's the trigger?

16:15.183 --> 16:16.768
She's not in puberty.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.395
-(scoffs)
-Is she?

16:18.436 --> 16:19.646
No.

16:19.688 --> 16:21.231
(sighs):
Oh, God.

16:26.361 --> 16:28.238
It really scared her
when it happened.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.572
Maybe she needs
to be scared, Vick.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.533
-She needs to be trained.
-Oh, my God.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.618
Our responsibility
is getting her ready.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.578
Making her strong
in case they come.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.039
Our responsibility
is to protect her.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.457
Training her is protecting her.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.667
Says the one who hates
her power so much,

16:40.709 --> 16:43.169
-she won't even use it.
-Wha...

16:43.211 --> 16:45.171
It's different for us.
We know what it's like...

16:45.213 --> 16:47.132
Be normal?

16:47.173 --> 16:49.259
But when you're born
this way... (stammers)

16:49.300 --> 16:51.636
She's not a robot.
She's a little girl.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.346
With little girl feelings
and emotions,

16:53.388 --> 16:55.265
which are wildly unpredictable.

16:55.306 --> 16:56.808
It's too dangerous.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.227
She just has to shove it down
and keep it hidden.

16:59.269 --> 17:00.812
She did it before.

17:02.230 --> 17:03.857
She can do it again.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.192
(whistle blows)

17:06.234 --> 17:08.236
-(playful chatter)
-(shoes squeaking)

17:29.758 --> 17:31.509
(chuckles)

17:32.844 --> 17:34.763
GAVIN:
Ha-ha! Ha-ha!

17:34.804 --> 17:37.223
-Loser.
-(panting)

17:37.265 --> 17:38.850
(chuckles)

17:38.892 --> 17:40.352
Let's go.

17:41.603 --> 17:43.480
MS. GARDNER:
You okay, Charlie?

17:43.521 --> 17:45.648
* *

17:45.690 --> 17:47.650
Weirdo.

17:47.692 --> 17:49.736
(panting continues)

17:51.279 --> 17:54.115
GAVIN:
Yeah, run away, you freak.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.285
MS. GARDNER:
Charlie?

18:09.422 --> 18:11.091
(steam hissing)

18:14.969 --> 18:16.680
Charlie?

18:17.639 --> 18:19.599
(water running)

18:19.641 --> 18:22.352
* *

18:38.368 --> 18:39.577
Charlie?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.920
What the...

18:51.256 --> 18:53.299
(Charlie breathing shakily)

18:58.722 --> 19:00.890
Please. Charlie?

19:01.891 --> 19:03.935
Whatever's going on...

19:05.603 --> 19:07.313
-Charlie? (gasps)
-(door sizzles)

19:08.648 --> 19:10.400
CHARLIE:
Please leave.

19:10.442 --> 19:12.485
(crying softly)

19:15.363 --> 19:17.198
Charlie?

19:20.535 --> 19:22.704
-(door banging)
-(gasps)

19:25.373 --> 19:27.834
(banging continues faster)

19:36.885 --> 19:38.386
(screams)

19:38.428 --> 19:40.555
(steam hissing)

19:41.639 --> 19:43.600
(breathing shakily)

19:43.641 --> 19:45.602
* *

19:45.643 --> 19:47.687
(steam hissing)

19:55.320 --> 19:57.864
Holy sh-shit.

20:01.910 --> 20:03.828
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

20:09.584 --> 20:13.338
I was in the east end,
uh, of the school...

20:13.380 --> 20:14.714
VICKY:
It won't happen again.

20:14.756 --> 20:16.800
How can you be so sure?

20:17.884 --> 20:21.513
Does Charlie have a history
of destructive behavior?

20:21.554 --> 20:23.264
No, of course not.

20:23.306 --> 20:25.058
She's been less than forthcoming

20:25.100 --> 20:26.643
about how she did it.

20:26.685 --> 20:30.522
What she used
to cause the explosion.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.898
Please don't call it
an explosion.

20:31.940 --> 20:33.441
It makes her sound like
a terrorist.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.735
The bathroom stall
exploded, ma'am.

20:35.777 --> 20:37.696
What would you like us
to call it?

20:37.737 --> 20:41.866
Regardless, the police want to
investigate the matter further.

20:45.453 --> 20:47.414
That blast was like
a siren call.

20:47.455 --> 20:48.748
I know you don't want
to hear this,

20:48.790 --> 20:50.291
but none of this
would have happened

20:50.333 --> 20:51.584
-if she knew how to use it.
-(scoffs)

20:51.626 --> 20:53.586
Jesus.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.422
Look at my eyes.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.924
Every time I try to do it,
it-it chips away at me now.

20:57.966 --> 21:00.927
I can't do the push without
my eyes literally bleeding now.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.679
Why didn't you tell me?

21:02.721 --> 21:04.764
(pants) Come on.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.641
But that doesn't mean
it will happen to Charlie.

21:06.683 --> 21:08.059
That's not a risk
I'm willing to take.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.439
I don't have your power.

21:12.480 --> 21:13.690
Okay?

21:13.732 --> 21:15.400
I can't push her
if she loses control.

21:15.442 --> 21:17.485
Well, I would never push
my own kid.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.614
Our cover is blown, okay?

21:21.656 --> 21:24.492
If they catch her,
they're gonna lock her away.

21:24.534 --> 21:26.619
They're gonna run tests on her
for the rest of her life.

21:26.661 --> 21:28.913
They're gonna take her,
they're gonna put her in a cage.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.623
We'll never see her again, Vick.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.917
Who knows what's gonna
happen to her?

21:33.877 --> 21:35.754
If who catches me?

21:38.381 --> 21:40.091
You're supposed to be
in your room, Charlie.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.552
You were yelling.

21:44.846 --> 21:47.015
Charlie, I need you to go
to your room right now, okay?

21:47.057 --> 21:49.059
And pack a bag.
We're leaving in the morning.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.687
Sweetie, do you think--
Are we bad people, Charlie?

21:53.688 --> 21:55.398
Mm-mm.

21:55.440 --> 21:56.900
ANDY: Do you know why
we have to move all the time?

21:57.901 --> 21:59.486
Hmm?

21:59.527 --> 22:01.154
Because of your work.

22:01.196 --> 22:04.491
But also because
bad men are after us.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.034
Really bad.

22:06.076 --> 22:08.036
Because of the special things
that we can do,

22:08.078 --> 22:10.038
the pushing and the fire.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.707
And if they catch us,
they're gonna put us in jail.

22:12.749 --> 22:15.502
It's why we can't have
cell phones or Wi-Fi.

22:15.543 --> 22:17.545
Because they can track it.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.547
I'm sorry we lied to you.

22:19.589 --> 22:22.676
But I ran to the bathroom
so I wouldn't hurt anyone.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.511
That was the right thing
to do, Charlie.

22:24.552 --> 22:26.096
That was, that was right.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.932
I tried to throw it in
the water, but it didn't work.

22:28.973 --> 22:30.850
And now we're in trouble
and we're going to jail,

22:30.892 --> 22:32.185
and it's all my fault.

22:32.227 --> 22:33.770
-Okay, you got to stay calm.
-(panting)

22:33.812 --> 22:34.938
-Calm down, Charlie.
-Just stay calm, sweetie.

22:34.979 --> 22:36.439
-You're okay.
-I'm not okay.

22:36.481 --> 22:38.858
Stop saying that.
And I'm not special!

22:38.900 --> 22:40.610
I'm a monster! (crying)

22:40.652 --> 22:42.153
-You are not a monster.
-You just need to calm down.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.905
-I'm a monster. I'm a monster.
-You're not. -Calm down.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.074
-You're not a monster.
-I'm a monster. I'm a monster!

22:46.116 --> 22:47.701
-(panting)
-Charlie.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.577
I hate living like this!

22:49.619 --> 22:51.496
Tough luck, Charlie!
This is who you are!

22:51.538 --> 22:53.832
Please, Andy. Stop.

22:53.873 --> 22:56.418
You made me this way. (crying)

22:56.459 --> 22:57.877
Charlie, please!

22:57.919 --> 23:00.046
I hate who I am, and I hate you!

23:00.088 --> 23:01.881
(screams) Charlie!

23:01.923 --> 23:03.633
(whimpering)

23:03.675 --> 23:05.552
Charlie!

23:06.553 --> 23:08.096
(both panting)

23:08.138 --> 23:10.807
You're all right. Oh, God.

23:10.849 --> 23:13.184
(whispers):
I'm really sorry, sweetie.

23:13.226 --> 23:15.979
CHARLIE:
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

23:16.021 --> 23:17.564
-I'm so sorry.
-Charlie.

23:17.605 --> 23:19.232
-Charlie, no. Charlie, no.
-(crying)

23:19.274 --> 23:20.859
-Charlie.
-(phone line ringing)

23:20.900 --> 23:22.068
Charlie, no. I'll be okay.

23:22.110 --> 23:23.862
(shushing)

23:23.903 --> 23:26.656
-(Vicky groans)
-(whispering): She's okay.

23:26.698 --> 23:27.991
DISPATCHER (over phone):
911. What is your emergency?

23:28.033 --> 23:30.577
-See? She's fine.
-(whimpers quietly)

23:30.618 --> 23:33.079
-Come on. Please.
-DISPATCHER: Hello?

23:33.121 --> 23:35.582
Hello?

23:35.623 --> 23:36.833
-Are you there...
-(phone beeps)

23:36.875 --> 23:38.710
Okay.

23:38.752 --> 23:41.004
It's okay. It's all right.

23:41.963 --> 23:44.007
(shallow breathing)

23:45.300 --> 23:46.843
It's okay. It's all right.

23:46.885 --> 23:49.512
* *

24:11.868 --> 24:14.537
("Control, I'm Here"
by Nitzer Ebb playing)

24:20.335 --> 24:22.545
* I'm here *

24:28.677 --> 24:32.806
* We close our eyes,
we close our eyes *

24:32.847 --> 24:34.265
* Close them in your dreams *

24:34.307 --> 24:35.975
* Close them in your home *

24:36.017 --> 24:38.144
* I'm here to stay *

24:38.186 --> 24:41.064
* I won't go away *

24:41.106 --> 24:43.692
* You don't need me *

24:43.733 --> 24:45.735
* I'll slip away *

24:48.196 --> 24:50.907
* You can't hear me... *

24:50.949 --> 24:52.992
-(music stops)
-(phone buzzing)

24:58.164 --> 24:59.874
HOLLISTER (over phone):
Is this Rainbird?

24:59.916 --> 25:01.543
RAINBIRD:
Yes.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.962
HOLLISTER: This is
Captain Jane Hollister, DSI.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.840
I'm reactivating you, Rainbird.

25:09.050 --> 25:11.344
If that would be of interest.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.263
Course it's still the cleaning
up other people's shit,

25:13.304 --> 25:15.557
just not literally.

25:18.059 --> 25:20.061
I left that life.

25:20.103 --> 25:22.939
Yeah, and how's that
working out for ya?

25:22.981 --> 25:24.691
I know what happened.

25:24.733 --> 25:28.069
Shop used you up and threw you
out like unwanted trash.

25:29.070 --> 25:30.822
And that wasn't right.

25:32.198 --> 25:34.743
But that was the old guard.
I'm the new.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.750
Something's happened, Rainbird,

25:41.791 --> 25:43.835
and I need it handled
with discretion.

25:43.877 --> 25:46.588
I understand
that was your specialty.

25:53.094 --> 25:54.804
What is the target?

25:57.849 --> 26:02.604
Something for which
you are uniquely qualified.

26:04.272 --> 26:06.900
But unlike the others,

26:06.941 --> 26:09.944
I need this quarry back alive.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.281
Is that something
you can handle?

26:16.659 --> 26:18.703
* *

26:25.794 --> 26:27.796
(crying)

26:30.298 --> 26:32.967
ANDY (whispers):
Good job. Good job.

26:38.431 --> 26:39.808
-There we go.
-(pained whimpering)

26:39.849 --> 26:42.227
-You okay?
-Ow.

26:42.268 --> 26:45.438
-Ow. Ow. Oh.
-(sighs, grunts)

26:45.480 --> 26:47.649
(pained sigh)

26:47.691 --> 26:49.901
Vick, this is bad.

26:49.943 --> 26:52.278
(pained grunting)

26:52.320 --> 26:54.155
Oh, fuck.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.116
(whispers):
Almost done.

26:56.157 --> 26:58.201
(pained breathing)

27:00.036 --> 27:01.788
That's it.

27:01.830 --> 27:04.374
You could've pushed her.

27:04.416 --> 27:06.251
We have no idea
what's happening when

27:06.292 --> 27:08.712
I'm going into those people's
minds, moving things around.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.338
Why would you ever want me
to do that to Charlie?

27:10.380 --> 27:12.882
-What if I mess her up?
-And if she kills one of us?

27:12.924 --> 27:14.926
Don't fucking go there.

27:14.968 --> 27:16.469
-Andy.
-(groans)

27:16.511 --> 27:19.806
This is what happens
when you stuff it down.

27:19.848 --> 27:21.182
(whispers):
It doesn't go away.

27:22.767 --> 27:25.186
Can you take her to the movies
or something, please?

27:25.228 --> 27:27.022
Ice cream or something?

27:30.358 --> 27:32.944
(pained whimpering)

27:32.986 --> 27:35.155
-Just get some rest, okay?
-Okay.

27:35.196 --> 27:37.240
* *

27:54.841 --> 27:56.885
(sniffling)

27:58.928 --> 28:00.972
(panting)

28:19.115 --> 28:21.159
* *

28:42.138 --> 28:44.182
* *

29:07.080 --> 29:09.040
-(loud knocking)
-(shouts, gasps)

29:09.082 --> 29:11.126
(panting)

29:11.167 --> 29:12.919
(knocking)

29:22.512 --> 29:24.055
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

29:24.097 --> 29:25.056
Vicky McGee?

29:25.098 --> 29:26.516
I'm just following up

29:26.558 --> 29:29.227
on an emergency call
from earlier tonight.

29:29.269 --> 29:30.395
Oh, yeah.

29:30.437 --> 29:32.480
It was a grease fire.

29:32.522 --> 29:33.815
On the stove.

29:33.857 --> 29:35.275
My daughter overreacted.

29:35.316 --> 29:37.444
If you or your daughter
need help...

29:37.485 --> 29:39.362
It's nothing like that.

29:40.655 --> 29:42.157
Honestly.

29:44.951 --> 29:48.121
You're sure about that,
you have a good night, then.

29:54.127 --> 29:55.337
(door closes)

29:57.130 --> 29:58.506
(sighs)

30:04.054 --> 30:06.306
Oh, Charlie.

30:06.348 --> 30:09.392
Ow. (grunts, pants)

30:13.229 --> 30:15.273
* *

30:20.570 --> 30:23.198
-(gasps)
-Where did they go?

30:24.199 --> 30:27.243
Your husband and the girl.

30:30.372 --> 30:32.457
-(grunts)
-(voice whispering, echoing)

30:32.499 --> 30:36.169
VICKY (echoing):
Ice cream. Movies.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.171
(Vicky gasps, whimpers)

30:39.214 --> 30:42.050
Ice cream...

30:42.092 --> 30:43.927
or the movies?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.136
(gasps)

30:45.178 --> 30:48.014
(panting)

30:48.056 --> 30:50.016
Did you think you were unique?

30:50.058 --> 30:53.645
Before they tested their poison
on pretty, young coeds,

30:53.687 --> 30:56.231
they had to use lab rats.

31:03.530 --> 31:05.573
And you're out of practice.

31:07.075 --> 31:09.035
(panting)

31:09.077 --> 31:11.413
* *

31:18.086 --> 31:19.587
(soft rumble)

31:29.264 --> 31:31.307
(whimpering)

31:35.562 --> 31:37.063
(lock clicks)

31:38.440 --> 31:39.941
(gasps)

31:43.778 --> 31:45.238
(panting)

31:45.280 --> 31:47.657
How could you work for them?

31:47.699 --> 31:50.035
Help them
after what they did to you?

31:50.076 --> 31:52.662
Come peacefully,
and you'll live.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.457
I will die
before I let them have her.

31:55.498 --> 31:58.585
Your life, to them,
is a secondary concern.

31:58.626 --> 32:00.503
And yours?

32:02.172 --> 32:04.632
(grunts, screams)

32:06.509 --> 32:08.178
(panting)

32:08.219 --> 32:10.472
(screams)

32:13.224 --> 32:15.268
(panting)

32:24.652 --> 32:28.281
When you see her,
you'll understand.

32:28.323 --> 32:30.492
And you will regret.

32:30.533 --> 32:32.744
(Vicky panting)

32:41.503 --> 32:44.130
Do you think she'll forgive me?

32:44.172 --> 32:47.217
(breathes deeply)

32:47.258 --> 32:49.177
Well, she's your mom.

32:49.219 --> 32:51.429
She'll always forgive you.

32:51.471 --> 32:53.348
No matter what.

32:56.685 --> 32:59.020
(quietly):
It was supposed to be you.

32:59.062 --> 33:00.355
What?

33:05.360 --> 33:07.654
It was supposed to be you.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.032
(Charlie sighs)

33:21.209 --> 33:22.502
(Andy sighs)

33:22.544 --> 33:24.379
-(door closes)
-(lock clicks)

33:25.880 --> 33:28.383
I feel weird.

33:28.425 --> 33:31.094
Mm, too much rocky road.

33:31.136 --> 33:32.387
She's probably asleep.

33:32.429 --> 33:33.513
I'm gonna go check on her, okay?

33:33.555 --> 33:35.432
Here, take that to the trash.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.517
And then throw on your pj's,
all right?

33:52.657 --> 33:55.493
* *

33:55.535 --> 33:57.537
(panting)

33:57.579 --> 33:58.747
Surrender.

33:58.788 --> 34:00.540
-ANDY: Charlie?
-Daddy?

34:00.582 --> 34:02.542
RAINBIRD:
No one gets hurt.

34:03.585 --> 34:05.295
-(neck cracks)
-(soft rumble)

34:06.755 --> 34:08.131
Let her go.

34:09.424 --> 34:11.468
You know what it costs,
don't you?

34:12.469 --> 34:14.137
To hurt someone.

34:14.179 --> 34:15.805
To take a life.

34:15.847 --> 34:19.100
Would you ask that
of your own child?

34:20.852 --> 34:23.730
-(soft crackling)
-Do you feel that?

34:23.772 --> 34:26.358
Let her go,
or it's gonna get a lot worse.

34:26.399 --> 34:27.484
Where's Mommy?

34:27.525 --> 34:28.902
She has no aim without sight

34:28.943 --> 34:30.570
if she's like the rest of us.

34:30.612 --> 34:32.280
Where's my wife?

34:34.240 --> 34:36.284
(Charlie panting)

34:36.326 --> 34:37.285
(sizzling)

34:37.327 --> 34:38.536
CHARLIE:
Where's Mommy?

34:41.414 --> 34:43.333
ANDY:
I don't know, sweetheart.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.834
RAINBIRD:
Yes, you do.

34:44.876 --> 34:47.128
Where's Mommy?! Tell me now!

34:49.464 --> 34:51.466
-(gasps)
-Mom?

34:52.384 --> 34:54.260
(grunting)

34:54.302 --> 34:55.470
(Charlie panting)

34:56.638 --> 34:58.139
(gasping)

34:58.181 --> 35:00.892
(screaming)

35:00.934 --> 35:02.560
(grunts)

35:02.602 --> 35:04.437
-Run.
-(glass breaking)

35:04.479 --> 35:05.522
Run, Charlie!

35:05.563 --> 35:08.358
(alarm blaring)

35:08.400 --> 35:09.693
-Run!
-Mommy!

35:16.449 --> 35:18.660
(coughing)

35:18.702 --> 35:20.745
(alarm continues blaring)

35:26.501 --> 35:28.712
Come on. We have to get
somewhere safe.

35:28.753 --> 35:31.214
(tires squealing)

35:36.553 --> 35:38.596
* *

35:47.439 --> 35:48.773
(knocking)

35:48.815 --> 35:52.193
WOMAN:
Dr. Wanless, you have a guest.

35:54.029 --> 35:56.698
Good morning, Joseph.

35:56.740 --> 35:58.783
I brought you something.

36:00.535 --> 36:02.537
Your favorite colors, too.

36:09.502 --> 36:12.589
I'm Captain Hollister,
newly appointed DSI.

36:12.630 --> 36:15.550
Why are you here?

36:15.592 --> 36:17.635
Hmm, Captain?

36:17.677 --> 36:20.847
I made calls
to your predecessor.

36:20.889 --> 36:22.599
They went unanswered.

36:22.640 --> 36:23.850
Hmm.

36:23.892 --> 36:27.854
But now they stuff a new face

36:27.896 --> 36:30.815
into the same old suit,

36:30.857 --> 36:33.735
and that face just comes

36:33.777 --> 36:36.237
knocking on my door!

36:36.279 --> 36:37.864
With all due respect, Doctor,

36:37.906 --> 36:41.284
Captain McConnell doesn't have
the legs for this outfit.

36:41.326 --> 36:43.411
Completely oblivious

36:43.453 --> 36:47.540
to the dire nature
of the situation we've created!

36:47.582 --> 36:48.667
We found them.

36:48.708 --> 36:50.502
Joseph.

36:50.543 --> 36:52.796
* *

36:52.837 --> 36:54.506
Shall we talk?

36:59.094 --> 37:02.055
(panting)

37:02.097 --> 37:05.892
VICKY: When you see her,
you'll understand.

37:05.934 --> 37:07.977
And you will regret.

37:10.063 --> 37:12.273
(birds chirping)

37:15.610 --> 37:17.612
(vehicles passing)

37:19.739 --> 37:21.700
CHARLIE:
I miss you, Mommy.

37:21.741 --> 37:22.909
I'll get 'em.

37:45.557 --> 37:47.100
(sighs)

37:47.142 --> 37:48.685
(exhales sharply)

37:51.730 --> 37:53.773
* *

37:57.569 --> 37:59.612
(panting)

38:09.664 --> 38:10.999
(grunts softly)

38:14.961 --> 38:17.005
* *

38:21.634 --> 38:22.761
(laughing)

38:22.802 --> 38:23.803
-(screams)
-(laughs)

38:23.845 --> 38:26.348
-(panting)
-(screaming)

38:26.389 --> 38:27.766
(gasps)

38:31.019 --> 38:33.063
(panting softly)

38:43.531 --> 38:44.908
(panting)

38:44.949 --> 38:47.869
-Oh, hi. Hi, kitty-kitty.
-(meowing)

38:48.870 --> 38:50.080
Hi.

38:51.414 --> 38:52.791
Come here, kitty-kitty.

38:52.832 --> 38:55.126
Come here. It's okay.

38:55.168 --> 38:56.753
Don't run away. Come on.

38:56.795 --> 38:59.422
-It's okay. I'm nice.
-(purring)

38:59.464 --> 39:00.507
I won't hurt you.

39:00.548 --> 39:02.008
(yowls)

39:02.050 --> 39:03.468
(grunts)

39:03.510 --> 39:05.637
(cat hisses, yowls)

39:06.638 --> 39:07.972
Charlie?

39:10.725 --> 39:12.394
Charlie?

39:13.228 --> 39:15.397
-(panting)
-(fire crackling)

39:15.438 --> 39:16.940
(cat meowing weakly)

39:16.981 --> 39:18.733
He scratched me.

39:23.113 --> 39:24.906
Honey, he's in pain.

39:26.449 --> 39:28.201
You have to put him
out of his misery, all right?

39:28.243 --> 39:29.661
(crying)

39:29.703 --> 39:31.788
I really didn't mean to.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.915
-I know you didn't. I know.
-(sniffling)

39:34.916 --> 39:36.918
This is what it costs, though.

39:38.128 --> 39:39.713
(Charlie continues crying)

39:39.754 --> 39:42.090
'Cause it can't be
a reaction like that.

39:42.132 --> 39:44.718
-It's got to be a...
-(meows weakly)

39:44.759 --> 39:46.594
a decision.

39:46.636 --> 39:48.096
That's the only way
you can control it.

39:49.097 --> 39:50.849
You can do it.

39:52.600 --> 39:55.603
(meowing weakly)

39:57.230 --> 39:59.149
(breathes deeply)

40:01.568 --> 40:02.944
(fire sizzling)

40:02.986 --> 40:05.030
-(fire roars)
-(cat yowls)

40:07.032 --> 40:09.743
(Charlie crying)

40:11.745 --> 40:13.121
Good job.

40:18.501 --> 40:20.170
I want to help her.

40:20.211 --> 40:22.047
You want to use her.

40:22.088 --> 40:23.965
The girl--
she can't help what she is.

40:24.007 --> 40:28.136
She-- the poor thing, she's
been brain-fucked from birth.

40:28.178 --> 40:34.100
This is a chance to turn a past
failure into present success.

40:34.142 --> 40:38.146
I want you to come back
to work, Dr. Wanless.

40:40.940 --> 40:44.694
How hard must it have been
for them?

40:44.736 --> 40:47.655
The parents,
when the girl was born.

40:47.697 --> 40:50.241
The bottle is late,

40:50.283 --> 40:52.243
the baby cries,

40:52.285 --> 40:57.582
and a teddy bear
bursts into flames.

40:58.750 --> 41:00.835
Right there.

41:00.877 --> 41:03.963
In the crib beside her.

41:04.005 --> 41:07.175
Can you imagine their fear?

41:08.218 --> 41:09.928
And it's awful. That's really--

41:09.969 --> 41:11.221
What's your point?

41:11.262 --> 41:16.267
The girl's power
is in its infancy.

41:18.103 --> 41:23.692
Terrible, yes, but trivial
compared to what's coming.

41:24.693 --> 41:29.531
But she's growing,
our little girl.

41:29.572 --> 41:33.660
She's becoming a young woman.

41:33.702 --> 41:38.540
And someday soon,
the power will grow, too.

41:38.581 --> 41:40.542
Perhaps it already has.

41:42.168 --> 41:45.213
And then, one day,

41:45.255 --> 41:47.716
she may be capable...

41:49.718 --> 41:53.930
...of creating
a nuclear explosion

41:53.972 --> 41:57.684
simply with the force
of her mind.

41:57.726 --> 42:00.353
Doctor, we built a facility

42:00.395 --> 42:03.023
especially for people
like Charlie.

42:03.064 --> 42:06.693
We can teach her.
We can train her.

42:06.735 --> 42:08.653
You can exploit her.

42:08.695 --> 42:10.864
Don't you lecture me
on morality.

42:10.905 --> 42:12.699
You developed Lot Six.

42:12.741 --> 42:14.117
You gave it to those kids.

42:14.159 --> 42:15.869
And it was a mistake!

42:15.910 --> 42:17.954
Well, that's too fucking bad!

42:17.996 --> 42:19.831
It's done!

42:19.873 --> 42:21.291
-(sighs)
-Jesus fuck--

42:21.332 --> 42:23.084
We're not gonna clone her.

42:23.126 --> 42:25.170
We're not gonna make
a little army of Charlies.

42:25.211 --> 42:26.921
We just, we...

42:28.298 --> 42:30.925
We want to understand her.

42:34.262 --> 42:36.097
She's the first of her kind.

42:36.139 --> 42:39.976
And no one understands her
better than you,

42:40.018 --> 42:42.270
the man who made the serum.

42:42.312 --> 42:46.149
You're the father of it all.

42:46.191 --> 42:48.234
What do you say?

42:54.449 --> 42:59.329
There are none so blind
as those who will not see.

43:01.956 --> 43:03.166
What?

43:06.294 --> 43:09.297
Heed my words...

43:09.339 --> 43:11.049
very carefully.

43:13.301 --> 43:14.928
Terminate the girl,

43:14.969 --> 43:18.932
or one day
she will destroy us all.

43:18.973 --> 43:20.684
Do you hear me?

43:21.476 --> 43:24.187
Terminate her.

43:26.147 --> 43:29.651
I hoped
this would've gone better.

43:30.443 --> 43:32.654
(panting softly)

43:34.114 --> 43:36.074
That's good.

43:36.116 --> 43:38.159
-Can we pray?
-(sighs)

43:39.911 --> 43:42.914
Yeah. Sure, we can pray.

43:42.956 --> 43:44.666
(sighs) All right.

43:45.500 --> 43:47.168
(sighs)

43:48.169 --> 43:50.797
Dear God,

43:50.839 --> 43:54.092
please let this... cat

43:54.134 --> 43:57.303
be happy in cat heaven.

43:57.345 --> 44:02.851
And, um, just, you know,
make sure that-that he, uh...

44:02.892 --> 44:04.436
or she...

44:05.770 --> 44:07.105
...or they,

44:07.147 --> 44:10.984
it's like a big cat party
in cat heaven.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.861
And bless Mommy, too.

44:12.902 --> 44:15.280
* *

44:17.949 --> 44:19.701
(whispers):
Bless Mommy, too.

44:24.247 --> 44:26.332
You know what Mom
wanted you to learn

44:26.374 --> 44:28.376
more than anything in the world?

44:31.504 --> 44:34.215
She wanted you to learn
to use your power.

44:35.216 --> 44:37.093
Because it's incredible.

44:37.135 --> 44:39.304
And I bet if you have
her powers, you...

44:40.930 --> 44:42.807
...probably have mine, too.

44:45.060 --> 44:48.063
-The push?
-Yep.

44:51.941 --> 44:54.194
It's serious stuff, Charlie.

44:54.235 --> 44:56.738
That's why Mom wanted
to teach you,

44:56.780 --> 44:59.741
to help you understand
how to use it.

45:01.159 --> 45:02.869
(sighs)

45:02.911 --> 45:05.246
If you do it too much,
it'll really hurt you.

45:05.288 --> 45:07.916
But I don't feel the heat
when it happens.

45:10.251 --> 45:12.295
It hurts you
on the inside, I mean.

45:14.255 --> 45:16.841
Actually...

45:16.883 --> 45:18.426
it feels kind of good.

45:26.935 --> 45:29.229
Why can't we drive our own car?

45:29.270 --> 45:31.314
Because they're looking for us.

45:33.400 --> 45:35.360
They won't really
put us in jail.

45:35.402 --> 45:37.112
Not you.

45:38.613 --> 45:40.156
They'll study you.

45:41.616 --> 45:43.326
Like the frog.

45:44.285 --> 45:45.870
Yeah.

45:46.955 --> 45:48.331
Yeah, like the frog.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.584
Here's one.

45:51.626 --> 45:53.545
Oh, come on, please. Yes!

45:55.547 --> 45:57.298
Okay.

45:58.258 --> 46:00.260
Do you really think
this is safe?

46:00.301 --> 46:03.054
Right now, I think
we have to get off this road.

46:03.096 --> 46:04.931
So... (sighs)

46:04.973 --> 46:06.808
Come on. We'll be smart.

46:06.850 --> 46:08.476
(music playing quietly
over truck stereo)

46:08.518 --> 46:10.395
Be clever. Let's go.

46:11.354 --> 46:13.023
Oh, man.

46:13.064 --> 46:14.524
I didn't think anyone
was gonna stop. (chuckles)

46:14.566 --> 46:17.235
There's a lot of weirdos
around these parts. (laughs)

46:17.277 --> 46:18.486
You one of 'em?

46:18.528 --> 46:20.447
No, no, no, we're very normal.

46:20.488 --> 46:22.490
Y-- Uh, tell the nice man
your name, sweetheart.

46:22.532 --> 46:25.368
I'm Roberta,
but they call me Bobbi.

46:25.410 --> 46:27.078
ANDY: Yeah,
we're headed up to Boston.

46:27.120 --> 46:29.164
My car broke down a ways back.

46:29.205 --> 46:30.999
Boston's a hell of a walk
from here.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.001
Yeah, I know.
We really got to get there.

46:33.043 --> 46:34.461
Is there any chance
you can take us?

46:34.502 --> 46:36.296
To Boston?

46:36.338 --> 46:38.381
I'll cover your gas.

46:38.423 --> 46:39.924
I got things to do.

46:39.966 --> 46:42.344
I got to check up on my wife.

46:42.385 --> 46:43.553
What about a hundred bucks?

46:45.930 --> 46:48.975
-(high-pitched ringing)
-(soft rumbling)

46:49.017 --> 46:51.144
(heartbeat pulsing)

46:51.186 --> 46:53.396
(pupils squelching)

46:53.438 --> 46:55.357
(echoing):
One hundred bucks.

46:59.361 --> 47:00.528
(soft whoosh)

47:00.570 --> 47:03.490
Well, I'm not above a Benjamin.

47:03.531 --> 47:06.242
(chuckles) Climb in.

47:07.243 --> 47:09.162
Hey, it's lunchtime.

47:09.204 --> 47:10.538
The wife and I usually put out

47:10.580 --> 47:12.415
a little sandwich spread
about now.

47:12.457 --> 47:15.001
Why don't you come to the house
and-and fuel up for a bit?

47:15.043 --> 47:17.337
I don't know. We...

47:17.379 --> 47:18.880
My wife's waiting.

47:22.133 --> 47:24.219
But Bobbi needs to eat.

47:24.260 --> 47:25.637
Yeah.

47:26.680 --> 47:28.181
Coming up.

47:29.140 --> 47:31.184
* *

47:54.165 --> 47:56.209
* *

48:05.593 --> 48:07.971
-(sighs)
-Come on in.

48:08.013 --> 48:11.057
Let's get some food
in your bellies.

48:11.099 --> 48:13.435
Would it be okay
if I played with your chickens?

48:13.476 --> 48:16.563
Just watch out for the turds.
(chuckles softly)

48:17.564 --> 48:19.065
Yeah, sure.

48:19.107 --> 48:21.443
-Stay close, all right?
-Yep.

48:21.484 --> 48:23.403
Try not to cook any of them.

48:23.445 --> 48:26.239
(clucking)

48:28.700 --> 48:31.077
(grunts softly, chuckles)

48:31.119 --> 48:32.537
* *

48:32.579 --> 48:34.622
(woman's voice whispering
indistinctly)

48:41.463 --> 48:44.049
IRV:
Essi! We're home.

48:45.050 --> 48:46.968
Got some guests
for supper, Essi.

48:47.010 --> 48:49.971
Little Bobbi and her dad-- I
don't think I caught your name.

48:50.013 --> 48:51.473
Frank.

48:52.474 --> 48:54.267
Bobbi and Frank.

48:55.226 --> 48:57.270
-(refrigerator opens)
-(bottles rattle)

48:57.312 --> 48:59.230
Cold beer?

48:59.272 --> 49:00.732
Yeah, sure. Why not?

49:01.733 --> 49:03.068
Thank you.

49:04.069 --> 49:07.030
So, what do you do, Frank?

49:07.072 --> 49:09.032
To keep the lights on.

49:09.074 --> 49:10.408
I'm a life coach.

49:10.450 --> 49:11.618
No shit.

49:11.659 --> 49:14.204
-Like Tony Robbins on TV?
-No.

49:14.245 --> 49:16.414
-No, not really like that,
but... -(both laugh)

49:16.456 --> 49:20.251
I saw that documentary
on Netflix.

49:20.293 --> 49:22.212
Old Tony cusses like
a son of a bitch,

49:22.253 --> 49:25.048
but folks seem to like him.

49:25.090 --> 49:26.633
People will give you
their life savings

49:26.675 --> 49:29.052
just to tell them
they're special.

49:29.094 --> 49:30.345
-Life coach?
-Yeah.

49:30.387 --> 49:32.347
Man. (laughs)

49:32.389 --> 49:35.100
The whole world goin' to hell.

49:37.686 --> 49:39.729
(woman's breath echoing)

49:43.775 --> 49:46.027
(distorted woman's voice
echoing)

49:50.824 --> 49:52.283
Hello?

49:54.494 --> 49:56.371
Is anyone in there?

50:13.763 --> 50:15.807
(rhythmic pulsing)

50:20.520 --> 50:22.564
(panting softly)

50:27.861 --> 50:30.071
(panting)

50:32.866 --> 50:35.744
-(respirator pumping slowly)
-(labored breathing)

50:45.754 --> 50:47.505
What's your name?

50:48.506 --> 50:50.633
ESSI (echoing):
Essi.

50:51.593 --> 50:53.178
Hi, Essi.

50:54.929 --> 50:57.182
I'm Charlie.

50:57.223 --> 50:59.267
I'm here with my dad.

51:03.605 --> 51:04.773
Hey!

51:06.441 --> 51:08.109
How did you...?

51:08.151 --> 51:10.570
Don't go disturbing Essi!
She needs quiet!

51:10.612 --> 51:11.738
Hey, we're really sorry.

51:11.780 --> 51:14.532
You've been more than kind.

51:14.574 --> 51:15.617
Come on.

51:16.618 --> 51:18.411
We should probably get going.

51:18.453 --> 51:20.246
Where you headed?

51:20.288 --> 51:22.582
And how you getting there?

51:23.875 --> 51:25.460
I don't know.

51:28.963 --> 51:30.674
Hey, look, I...

51:30.715 --> 51:33.385
I overreact sometimes.

51:33.426 --> 51:36.346
Especially with the missus.

51:36.388 --> 51:38.431
I apologize.

51:39.766 --> 51:41.643
Oh, how rude of me.

51:41.685 --> 51:43.687
Come on.

51:49.859 --> 51:52.737
Essi, this is Frank.

51:52.779 --> 51:55.490
And I guess
you already met Roberta.

51:56.449 --> 51:59.202
She was making a left turn
out on Route 14,

51:59.244 --> 52:01.705
and some a-hole ran a light.

52:01.746 --> 52:03.373
She never saw it coming.

52:03.415 --> 52:05.208
I'm so sorry.

52:06.543 --> 52:08.586
We lost our boy that day, too.

52:10.797 --> 52:12.799
But Essi's still alive,

52:12.841 --> 52:15.844
and for that,
I'm more than grateful.

52:19.806 --> 52:21.766
You can stay here till you go.

52:21.808 --> 52:23.893
We'd enjoy the company.

52:25.854 --> 52:27.856
-(crickets chirping)
-(night birds calling)

52:30.817 --> 52:32.819
Will they find us?

52:32.861 --> 52:35.530
You let me worry about that.

52:35.572 --> 52:38.700
The most important thing
we can do is just keep running.

52:38.742 --> 52:40.952
If they do, I can hurt them.

52:42.495 --> 52:46.750
(breathes deeply)

52:46.791 --> 52:49.586
I'll only hurt bad people,
I promise.

52:51.379 --> 52:53.381
The day you were born.

52:53.423 --> 52:55.467
Do you remember that story?

52:56.926 --> 52:58.970
Mommy said
I was a buttery muffin.

52:59.012 --> 53:00.764
Oh, my gosh, you were.

53:00.805 --> 53:03.808
You were just
a little buttery muffin.

53:06.561 --> 53:07.979
There's more to that story.

53:08.021 --> 53:11.649
It was so cute
how warm you were,

53:11.691 --> 53:14.903
but pretty soon, your
body temperature just went...

53:14.944 --> 53:16.529
(whooshes)

53:16.571 --> 53:17.947
Shot off the charts.

53:17.989 --> 53:19.908
And the doctors,
they were all...

53:19.949 --> 53:21.242
they were all confused.

53:21.284 --> 53:23.244
They were, uh...

53:23.286 --> 53:24.788
They didn't know
what could cause this,

53:24.829 --> 53:27.832
so we stayed up with you
all night.

53:27.874 --> 53:29.542
All day.

53:29.584 --> 53:31.670
I could barely keep
my eyes open.

53:31.711 --> 53:33.713
I was falling asleep everywhere.

53:33.755 --> 53:34.923
(chuckles softly)

53:39.636 --> 53:41.930
And that's when they took you.

53:43.640 --> 53:45.558
I used to get
these premonitions,

53:45.600 --> 53:47.686
this really weird,
weird feeling.

53:47.727 --> 53:50.397
Like how I did at the house.

53:50.438 --> 53:51.523
Mm-hmm.

53:51.564 --> 53:55.694
I could sense where you were.

53:55.735 --> 53:57.404
I could see you.

53:57.445 --> 53:59.531
And I found you.

53:59.572 --> 54:00.949
What did you do?

54:05.453 --> 54:06.830
(sighs softly)

54:08.540 --> 54:10.875
* *

54:10.917 --> 54:13.670
-(cooing)
-(chuckles softly)

54:13.712 --> 54:15.005
(soft rumbling)

54:16.381 --> 54:20.051
I was so angry
at what they had done,

54:20.093 --> 54:22.345
I snapped.

54:22.387 --> 54:25.056
-(heartbeat pulsing)
-(fussing)

54:25.098 --> 54:27.308
(echoing):
When your partner comes back,

54:27.350 --> 54:29.769
you're gonna shoot him
in the chest.

54:29.811 --> 54:31.896
And then you're gonna forget
how to breathe.

54:33.815 --> 54:35.942
And I hurt those men.

54:38.653 --> 54:39.738
(cries out)

54:39.779 --> 54:42.490
(gasping, wheezing)

54:47.662 --> 54:51.791
And those guys,
they probably had wives.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.418
Kids.

54:55.003 --> 54:56.546
That they loved.

54:56.588 --> 54:59.841
Just like I love you.

54:59.883 --> 55:01.092
And I do, Charlie.

55:01.134 --> 55:03.428
I love you so much.

55:03.470 --> 55:05.513
But when you hurt people...

55:06.890 --> 55:08.808
...you don't just hurt them.

55:08.850 --> 55:10.852
It hurts everyone around them.

55:12.395 --> 55:14.731
You don't come back from that.

55:16.858 --> 55:18.651
Not ever.

55:22.155 --> 55:24.783
Okay, promise me
that you'll never

55:24.824 --> 55:26.868
use your gifts to hurt people.

55:26.910 --> 55:28.119
Promise?

55:29.621 --> 55:30.955
Promise.

55:32.707 --> 55:34.959
(sighs)

55:35.001 --> 55:36.503
Now, sleep.

55:36.544 --> 55:38.672
Get some sleep, all right?

55:39.923 --> 55:42.008
Come here.

55:42.050 --> 55:43.927
-Love you.
-Love you.

55:45.512 --> 55:48.932
(breathes deeply)

55:51.142 --> 55:53.395
* *

56:09.577 --> 56:10.829
NEWSMAN (over TV):
...Massachusetts fugitive

56:10.870 --> 56:12.539

57:10.013 --> 57:11.264
(TV audio rewinding)

57:11.306 --> 57:13.183
Hey, Irv.

57:13.224 --> 57:14.642
It's not true.

57:15.810 --> 57:17.687
I didn't kill my wife.

57:18.688 --> 57:21.024
You know I didn't kidnap
my daughter either.

57:21.066 --> 57:23.651
I don't know shit.

57:27.572 --> 57:28.823
You been up all night, Irv?

57:28.865 --> 57:30.825
Coming in my house,

57:30.867 --> 57:33.078
eating my food,

57:33.119 --> 57:35.288
drink my beer,

57:35.330 --> 57:37.957
and all the time,
you were a goddamn wife killer!

57:37.999 --> 57:39.584
I didn't kill her.

57:39.626 --> 57:40.710
Does my daughter seem
upset with me in any way?

57:40.752 --> 57:42.003
Does she seem scared of me?

57:42.045 --> 57:43.672
I'm trying to protect her.

57:43.713 --> 57:45.131
I'm trying to protect her
from them.

57:45.173 --> 57:48.593
You telling me
I-I can't trust the TV?

57:48.635 --> 57:50.512
Shocker, I know.

57:50.553 --> 57:52.514
(grunting)

57:53.932 --> 57:55.684
(Irv groaning)

57:57.686 --> 57:59.270
Irv, come on, man.

57:59.312 --> 58:00.980
(sighs)

58:02.732 --> 58:04.859
I know what happened.

58:05.860 --> 58:07.529
What are you talking about?

58:07.570 --> 58:09.739
You were driving that day,
and you were arguing.

58:09.781 --> 58:12.200
It got out of control,
and you hit a car head-on.

58:14.160 --> 58:15.829
That's how she got hurt.

58:15.870 --> 58:18.206
That's how Justin died.

58:19.207 --> 58:21.751
Essi told me.

58:21.793 --> 58:23.628
Told you?

58:23.670 --> 58:25.714
ANDY:
That's why they're after us.

58:28.049 --> 58:29.843
But there's something else.

58:29.884 --> 58:33.555
Something she's been wanting
to tell you for 30 years.

58:36.182 --> 58:38.643
She forgives you.

58:38.685 --> 58:41.688
You've hated yourself
all this time.

58:41.730 --> 58:43.773
It was an accident.

58:47.360 --> 58:48.945
And she forgives you.

58:48.987 --> 58:51.281
(sobs)

58:54.826 --> 58:56.995
(vehicles approaching)

58:57.037 --> 58:58.997
What is that?

58:59.039 --> 59:00.165
Uh, I called them.

59:00.206 --> 59:02.000
(sighs) The police.

59:02.042 --> 59:04.627
When I s-saw the news.

59:04.669 --> 59:06.338
Oh, my God.

59:06.379 --> 59:10.091
Like I said,
I-I overreact sometimes.

59:10.133 --> 59:12.093
(panting softly)

59:16.097 --> 59:18.099
* *

59:22.312 --> 59:23.980
-You two hide.
-(car door closes)

59:24.022 --> 59:25.357
I-I'll take care of this.

59:25.398 --> 59:26.900
What are you talking about, Irv?

59:26.941 --> 59:29.069
You're drunk.

59:29.110 --> 59:30.779
(sighs)

59:30.820 --> 59:32.864
Ought to make this
interesting, then.

59:32.906 --> 59:34.741
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

59:34.783 --> 59:36.076
Aaron Jeffery Cooper!

59:36.117 --> 59:38.787
-Surrender!
-IRV: Hide in there.

59:38.828 --> 59:41.956
PERRY: Girl inside,
hands on top of your head!

59:43.458 --> 59:45.168
Come on out, now.

59:47.295 --> 59:48.963
Mr. Cooper!

59:54.302 --> 59:56.763
Hey, I-I'm sorry, Wendell.

59:56.805 --> 59:58.765
I was mistaken.

59:58.807 --> 1:00:01.726
I thought I saw the man
and the girl, but I was wrong.

1:00:01.768 --> 1:00:04.938
You sounded pretty convinced
on the phone, Irv.

1:00:04.979 --> 1:00:07.273
Y-You know, just last month,

1:00:07.315 --> 1:00:12.028
I saw this documentary on TV
about, um,

1:00:12.070 --> 1:00:15.824
uh, I-I can't recall
the exact name,

1:00:15.865 --> 1:00:19.869
but i-it was something like
"walking dreaming."

1:00:19.911 --> 1:00:24.958
There was this guy on there
dreamt he swallowed a cockroach

1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:28.670
-and he jumped up and made
himself puke. -(Andy shushing)

1:00:28.712 --> 1:00:30.797
-It seemed so real.
-(whispering): It's all right.

1:00:30.839 --> 1:00:32.799
-(panting)
-(shushes)

1:00:32.841 --> 1:00:35.218
(fire crackling)

1:00:35.260 --> 1:00:36.970
-No, Charlie, Charlie.
-(panting rapidly)

1:00:37.012 --> 1:00:38.888
Hey, stay with me,
stay with me, stay with me.

1:00:38.930 --> 1:00:41.850
-Just breathe. Breathe.
-(panting slows)

1:00:41.891 --> 1:00:42.976
Breathe. That's right.

1:00:43.018 --> 1:00:44.352
(breathes deeply)

1:00:44.394 --> 1:00:46.104
I feel something.

1:00:46.146 --> 1:00:47.313
What?

1:00:49.274 --> 1:00:51.276
Someone's here.

1:00:51.317 --> 1:00:53.862
You saying you called us out
on account of a dream?

1:00:53.903 --> 1:00:55.280
IRV:
A pretty convincing one, too.

1:00:55.321 --> 1:00:58.116
Uh, uh, the news was on,

1:00:58.158 --> 1:01:00.326
I-I drifted off, and...

1:01:02.120 --> 1:01:03.830
...and I'm drunk.

1:01:03.872 --> 1:01:05.457
Want to know what I think?

1:01:06.458 --> 1:01:08.293
Not particularly.

1:01:08.335 --> 1:01:11.129
I think we're here,
and this man Cooper,

1:01:11.171 --> 1:01:12.839
he's considerably dangerous.

1:01:12.881 --> 1:01:14.966
So even if you were
just dreaming it, Irv,

1:01:15.008 --> 1:01:16.301
we'd like to search your...

1:01:16.343 --> 1:01:17.427
-(gunshot echoing)
-(grunts)

1:01:17.469 --> 1:01:19.179
Shit! Shit!

1:01:19.220 --> 1:01:20.847
Officer down!

1:01:20.889 --> 1:01:22.307
-We need back up now! Now!
-OFFICER: I see him!

1:01:23.850 --> 1:01:25.060
Tree line!

1:01:28.938 --> 1:01:30.065
(grunts)

1:01:31.399 --> 1:01:34.944
* *

1:01:36.071 --> 1:01:37.197
(panting)

1:01:44.871 --> 1:01:46.206
(grunts)

1:01:46.247 --> 1:01:47.540
-Breathe, okay?
-(panting)

1:01:47.582 --> 1:01:49.042
-He killed Mommy.
-Just breathe, Charlie.

1:01:49.084 --> 1:01:50.085
No, Charlie.

1:01:50.126 --> 1:01:51.920
Charlie! Charlie! No!

1:01:52.921 --> 1:01:55.048
(screams)

1:02:02.972 --> 1:02:05.517
(crying)

1:02:05.558 --> 1:02:07.268
I'm so sorry.

1:02:17.904 --> 1:02:20.281
Charlie, do you remember
what I taught you?

1:02:21.241 --> 1:02:23.284
-Keep running.
-Yeah.

1:02:33.253 --> 1:02:34.838
I love you, Daddy.

1:02:34.879 --> 1:02:36.548
I love you, too, sweetheart.

1:02:36.589 --> 1:02:37.924
Now, run.

1:02:37.966 --> 1:02:39.968
Run!

1:02:43.471 --> 1:02:44.848
(high-pitched ringing)

1:02:44.889 --> 1:02:46.099
-(neck cracks)
-(soft rumbling)

1:02:52.105 --> 1:02:54.149
(breath shuddering)

1:02:57.110 --> 1:03:00.363
(Irv groaning)

1:03:00.405 --> 1:03:02.449
* *

1:03:21.217 --> 1:03:22.594
Very clever.

1:03:27.265 --> 1:03:30.185
(pained grunting)

1:03:31.478 --> 1:03:33.063
(high-pitched ringing)

1:03:35.482 --> 1:03:38.443

1:03:45.992 --> 1:03:47.452
(chuckles)

1:03:47.494 --> 1:03:48.870
Gotcha.

1:04:00.048 --> 1:04:02.258
They will never stop
until they have her.

1:04:02.300 --> 1:04:04.177
You'll never catch her.

1:04:04.219 --> 1:04:05.428
(chuckles softly)

1:04:16.606 --> 1:04:18.566
(vehicle doors opening, closing)

1:04:18.608 --> 1:04:21.653
AGENT:
Lenses in. Lenses in.

1:04:22.570 --> 1:04:25.031
AGENT (over radio): Containment
team has arrived on site.

1:04:25.073 --> 1:04:26.366
Beginning perimeter search now.

1:04:26.408 --> 1:04:28.159
-(sighs)
-AGENT: Subject's down.

1:04:28.201 --> 1:04:29.994
Everybody's down.

1:04:30.036 --> 1:04:31.538
Except him.

1:04:31.579 --> 1:04:33.373
LEAD AGENT:
On your knees! Move in.

1:04:33.415 --> 1:04:35.375
-Move!
-Careful.

1:04:35.417 --> 1:04:36.626
He's dangerous.

1:04:38.586 --> 1:04:39.921
-(neck cracks)
-(soft rumbling)

1:04:39.963 --> 1:04:41.381
Give me your gun.

1:04:41.423 --> 1:04:43.049
No dice, freak.

1:04:43.091 --> 1:04:45.301
-We've got protection.
-(electronic chirp)

1:04:46.594 --> 1:04:48.596
LEAD AGENT:
Any sign of her?

1:04:48.638 --> 1:04:50.098
AGENT (over radio):
Negative.

1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:51.391
We're checking
the other structures.

1:04:51.433 --> 1:04:53.435
We found the owners inside.

1:04:53.476 --> 1:04:55.520
(search dogs barking
in distance)

1:04:57.147 --> 1:04:59.190

(panting)

1:05:06.072 --> 1:05:07.615
(crying)

1:05:21.212 --> 1:05:23.173
You lost her, Rainbird.

1:05:23.214 --> 1:05:25.300
You left a trail of dead cops
in your wake.

1:05:25.342 --> 1:05:27.093
You call that discretion?

1:05:27.135 --> 1:05:28.595
You have the father.

1:05:28.636 --> 1:05:30.013
So she's just gonna what?

1:05:30.055 --> 1:05:31.723
She's gonna feel her way here?

1:05:31.765 --> 1:05:33.475
They are connected.

1:05:33.516 --> 1:05:35.060
She will come for him.

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:40.648
Retirement has made you
sloppy and soft.

1:05:43.234 --> 1:05:45.320
Is that why you blindfold me?

1:05:46.571 --> 1:05:48.531
(door closes)

1:05:48.573 --> 1:05:51.993
I don't need to see your eyes
to feel your fear.

1:05:57.123 --> 1:05:59.167
You don't know what I feel.

1:06:01.503 --> 1:06:04.255
She will come for him.

1:06:04.297 --> 1:06:06.132
She will come for us all.

1:06:06.174 --> 1:06:09.135
She is my sister.

1:06:09.177 --> 1:06:11.012
My mother.

1:06:12.639 --> 1:06:14.683
Well, you killed her mother.

1:06:16.184 --> 1:06:18.228
She will be your death.

1:06:18.269 --> 1:06:20.313
A fate which I deserve.

1:06:22.190 --> 1:06:25.527
When you see her,
you will understand.

1:06:28.196 --> 1:06:30.573

1:07:02.564 --> 1:07:04.482
Where are you, Daddy?

1:07:07.318 --> 1:07:09.070
Tell me.

1:07:09.112 --> 1:07:11.072

1:07:21.583 --> 1:07:24.419
HOLLISTER:
Rise and shine, Mr. McGee.

1:07:24.461 --> 1:07:26.713
Or is it Mr. Burton?

1:07:26.755 --> 1:07:28.757
Mr. Rozelle?

1:07:32.218 --> 1:07:34.262
No more pseudonyms, Cooper.

1:07:37.223 --> 1:07:38.725
No more running.

1:07:40.310 --> 1:07:42.354
It's just you and me now.

1:07:51.237 --> 1:07:52.697
Wake up.

1:07:59.913 --> 1:08:04.584
Rainbird-- the man
who killed your poor wife--

1:08:04.626 --> 1:08:07.837
he believes that
you and your daughter,

1:08:07.879 --> 1:08:12.133
you have some kind of
a spiritual connection.

1:08:13.635 --> 1:08:15.345
Telepathy.

1:08:16.846 --> 1:08:19.224
Lot Six is full of surprises.

1:08:20.308 --> 1:08:21.851
Tell me where she is.

1:08:23.478 --> 1:08:26.815
Charlie is out there all alone.

1:08:28.650 --> 1:08:31.319
Without you, her emotions
will get the best of her.

1:08:31.361 --> 1:08:33.655
And what happens
when she gets upset?

1:08:33.697 --> 1:08:35.448
She gets scared.

1:08:35.490 --> 1:08:39.494
She is going to blow some
poor bastard to smithereens.

1:08:39.536 --> 1:08:41.287
She's gonna be killing people.

1:08:41.329 --> 1:08:43.915
How's she gonna live with that?

1:08:46.751 --> 1:08:48.670
Bring her here.

1:08:52.424 --> 1:08:54.718
What other choice do you have?

1:08:56.845 --> 1:08:58.763

1:09:18.742 --> 1:09:21.494
ANDY (whispering):
Charlie.

1:09:21.536 --> 1:09:23.496

Charlie.

1:09:23.538 --> 1:09:25.290
CHARLIE:
Daddy?

1:09:28.835 --> 1:09:32.255
-(ocean waves lapping)
-(seagulls squawking)

1:09:37.552 --> 1:09:39.554

1:09:45.769 --> 1:09:47.812

1:10:30.814 --> 1:10:33.650
(soft rumbling)

1:10:42.117 --> 1:10:44.327
I'm coming, Daddy.

1:10:45.453 --> 1:10:47.497
I'll find you.

1:10:47.539 --> 1:10:49.582

1:11:00.969 --> 1:11:02.971

1:11:23.992 --> 1:11:26.036

speaks indistinctly)

1:11:39.507 --> 1:11:41.551
* *

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:47.015
-What happened to your clothes?
-What happened to your face?

1:11:56.024 --> 1:11:58.401
Don't you ever bathe, weirdo?

1:11:58.443 --> 1:12:00.445
(chuckles)

1:12:01.446 --> 1:12:03.823
I'd like your bike.

1:12:03.865 --> 1:12:06.159
-(echoing): Please.
-(soft rumbling)

1:12:06.201 --> 1:12:08.495

1:12:16.544 --> 1:12:18.129
The hell are you doing, Dale?

1:12:19.130 --> 1:12:20.882
(soft rumbling)

1:12:20.924 --> 1:12:22.926

1:12:40.026 --> 1:12:42.070
* *

1:12:49.911 --> 1:12:51.663
Which way is the coast?

1:12:53.748 --> 1:12:56.418
The coast, dummies,
where the water is.

1:13:01.965 --> 1:13:04.009

1:13:30.952 --> 1:13:32.746

I mean, how's the nausea today?

1:14:03.109 --> 1:14:05.570
(groans) Sorry, babe.

1:14:05.612 --> 1:14:08.114
I mean, first trimester's
almost over, right?

1:14:08.156 --> 1:14:10.158
-The light at the end of
the tunnel. -(car alarm chirps)

1:14:10.200 --> 1:14:12.827
-Yeah.
-(car door opens, closes)

1:14:12.869 --> 1:14:14.746
All right. I'll see you
when I get home. Love you.

1:14:14.788 --> 1:14:16.581
Bye.

1:14:21.920 --> 1:14:23.505
It's you.

1:14:24.714 --> 1:14:26.758
Take your hand off the key.

1:14:28.677 --> 1:14:30.679
Give me your phone.

1:14:34.015 --> 1:14:35.558
And the card.

1:14:44.109 --> 1:14:46.027
Do you have a gun...

1:14:47.862 --> 1:14:49.864
-...Agent Jules?
-No.

1:14:49.906 --> 1:14:52.951
Uh, I'm just a tech.
They don't let us carry guns.

1:14:52.992 --> 1:14:54.703
This says you're an agent.

1:14:56.246 --> 1:14:58.998
JULES: We're all agents.
It's just... just a title.

1:14:59.040 --> 1:15:00.959
Is my father inside?

1:15:02.335 --> 1:15:03.878
-I don't know.
-(door handle rattling)

1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:05.672
-CHARLIE: Is he?
-I don't know.

1:15:05.714 --> 1:15:07.298
I swear, okay? I don't have
that kind of clearance.

1:15:07.340 --> 1:15:09.009
I don't want to hurt you, sir.

1:15:09.050 --> 1:15:10.635
Please, why are you doing this?

1:15:10.677 --> 1:15:12.178
Is my father inside?

1:15:12.220 --> 1:15:14.264
I don't know! Okay?

1:15:14.305 --> 1:15:16.224
Stop. Please.

1:15:16.266 --> 1:15:19.019
If he's here, he'll be, uh,
he'll be at the bottom.

1:15:19.060 --> 1:15:20.353
Who else is in there?

1:15:20.395 --> 1:15:23.690
JULES:
Computer techs, s-scientists,

1:15:23.732 --> 1:15:25.191
uh, that kind of thing.

1:15:25.233 --> 1:15:27.569
No long-haired men?

1:15:29.696 --> 1:15:30.697
Answer me!

1:15:30.739 --> 1:15:32.115
JULES:
Please, just--

1:15:32.157 --> 1:15:34.117
Okay, just stay calm.

1:15:34.159 --> 1:15:36.870
-We can work something...
-(echoing): Tell me!

1:15:36.911 --> 1:15:38.580
No!

1:15:42.625 --> 1:15:45.211
(panting)

1:15:49.215 --> 1:15:51.217
You said you didn't have a gun.

1:15:51.259 --> 1:15:54.637
(breathing weakly, wheezing)

1:15:56.056 --> 1:15:58.350
I don't want to hurt anyone.
I promised.

1:16:00.310 --> 1:16:02.270
He's in pain, Charlie.

1:16:03.271 --> 1:16:06.274
You'll have to put him
out of his misery.

1:16:06.316 --> 1:16:09.235
This is what it costs.

1:16:09.277 --> 1:16:12.739
(fire crackling, roaring)

1:16:13.907 --> 1:16:16.076

1:16:20.705 --> 1:16:23.041
What's going on?

1:16:23.083 --> 1:16:24.834
Ah, shit.

1:16:24.876 --> 1:16:26.086
(radio beeps)

1:16:26.127 --> 1:16:28.254
We got a disturbance
in the east lot.

1:16:28.296 --> 1:16:29.756
All units stand by.

1:16:52.862 --> 1:16:54.656

to the restricted level now.

1:17:03.498 --> 1:17:05.834

1:17:06.835 --> 1:17:08.753
(gasps)

1:17:09.462 --> 1:17:11.131
What the...?

1:17:11.172 --> 1:17:13.216
Oh, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1:17:45.206 --> 1:17:47.208

Oh, come on.

1:18:39.886 --> 1:18:42.263
GUARD (over radio):
Asset moving down hallway 12.

1:18:43.890 --> 1:18:46.184

Passing her off to beta team.

1:18:46.226 --> 1:18:48.812
BETA TEAM GUARD (over radio):
We've got her.

1:18:48.853 --> 1:18:50.772
Target visual acquired.

1:18:50.814 --> 1:18:53.024
Securing hallways
and doors behind her.

1:18:53.066 --> 1:18:54.901
-(door closes)
-(lock clanks)

1:18:54.943 --> 1:18:56.319
She's all yours, Cap.

1:18:59.489 --> 1:19:00.865
(Charlie gasps)

1:19:04.369 --> 1:19:06.121
Daddy!

1:19:07.163 --> 1:19:09.165
Daddy, wake up!

1:19:09.207 --> 1:19:11.543
(pounding continues)

1:19:11.584 --> 1:19:13.461
Daddy, wake up.

1:19:15.130 --> 1:19:17.007
Charlie?

1:19:18.216 --> 1:19:19.884
Wh-Why-Why are you here?

1:19:20.927 --> 1:19:24.014
I came. I got your message.

1:19:24.055 --> 1:19:25.473
(sighs)

1:19:27.142 --> 1:19:29.561
That wasn't me, Charlie.

1:19:29.602 --> 1:19:31.062
(gasps)

1:19:33.314 --> 1:19:35.316
ANDY:
I would never bring you here.

1:19:36.985 --> 1:19:38.945
That wasn't me.

1:19:38.987 --> 1:19:41.281
-But I can get you out.
-No.

1:19:41.322 --> 1:19:43.616
No, Charlie.

1:19:43.658 --> 1:19:46.286
There's no getting out.

1:19:46.327 --> 1:19:48.038
(groans softly)

1:19:48.079 --> 1:19:50.331
-There's no getting out for me.
-HOLLISTER: Charlie.

1:19:51.332 --> 1:19:53.918
It wasn't supposed to be
this way.

1:19:54.919 --> 1:19:57.380
Wasn't supposed to be
this difficult.

1:19:58.590 --> 1:20:00.342
Stay calm, dear.

1:20:00.383 --> 1:20:03.470
If you try to burn me,
you'll burn your daddy, too.

1:20:03.511 --> 1:20:06.056
My name's Captain Hollister,

1:20:06.097 --> 1:20:08.933
but you can call me Cap.

1:20:08.975 --> 1:20:10.977
I run this facility.

1:20:11.019 --> 1:20:13.021
You can trust me, Charlie.

1:20:14.689 --> 1:20:16.649
You'll be safe here.
You'll be protected.

1:20:16.691 --> 1:20:20.487
We'll take really good care
of you and your father.

1:20:20.528 --> 1:20:22.322
My dad needs a doctor.

1:20:22.364 --> 1:20:25.158
HOLLISTER: They've seen him
already, Charlie.

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:26.659
Microhemorrhages.

1:20:26.701 --> 1:20:30.455
His brain bleeds
when he uses his power.

1:20:32.665 --> 1:20:34.584
The same thing could happen
to you, too, Charlie,

1:20:34.626 --> 1:20:37.629
but we can teach you.

1:20:37.671 --> 1:20:40.006
-It's what your mother wanted.
-No.

1:20:40.048 --> 1:20:41.257
No.

1:20:42.217 --> 1:20:45.053
Call a doctor right now,

1:20:45.095 --> 1:20:47.347
or I'll hurt myself.

1:20:49.641 --> 1:20:52.143
Don't do it, Charlie.
Don't do it.

1:20:54.688 --> 1:20:56.898
Call a doctor right now.

1:20:57.732 --> 1:20:59.275
Do it!

1:21:12.372 --> 1:21:15.083
You're a very determined
young lady.

1:21:15.125 --> 1:21:17.711
Use it wisely,
it'll take you far in this life.

1:21:17.752 --> 1:21:19.421
I should know.

1:21:19.462 --> 1:21:21.715
You do bad things here.
I can feel it.

1:21:21.756 --> 1:21:23.091
No, we-we do great things.

1:21:23.133 --> 1:21:24.300
We make things better here.

1:21:24.342 --> 1:21:26.177
We-we make people better.

1:21:26.219 --> 1:21:29.264
We make them stronger,
people like you.

1:21:29.305 --> 1:21:30.640
Haven't you realized?

1:21:30.682 --> 1:21:35.061
You are a real-life

1:21:35.103 --> 1:21:37.272
superhero.

1:21:37.313 --> 1:21:39.441
Daddy.

1:21:40.567 --> 1:21:42.610
You're very special.

1:21:46.114 --> 1:21:47.699
The world out there--

1:21:47.741 --> 1:21:51.161
they don't know
how to handle your power.

1:21:52.162 --> 1:21:54.289
Here, we can handle it.

1:21:55.290 --> 1:21:57.208
Because we made you.

1:22:00.795 --> 1:22:02.255
Look at your father.

1:22:02.297 --> 1:22:03.673
(stifled grunt)

1:22:05.383 --> 1:22:08.261
They say
if he does one more push,

1:22:08.303 --> 1:22:10.430
it might kill him.

1:22:10.472 --> 1:22:13.016
You need us.

1:22:13.058 --> 1:22:15.518
I don't want to hurt anyone.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:18.563
I-I know you don't, honey.
I know.

1:22:21.316 --> 1:22:23.360
But we can't run anymore.

1:22:23.401 --> 1:22:25.111
I need you
to break your promise.

1:22:25.153 --> 1:22:27.197
(sobs softly):
Daddy.

1:22:27.238 --> 1:22:30.325
You have to burn it down,
starting with us.

1:22:31.451 --> 1:22:33.286
Daddy, what are you...

1:22:33.328 --> 1:22:35.622
-(neck cracks)
-(loud rumbling)

1:22:35.663 --> 1:22:37.457
ANDY:
I'm sorry to make you do this.

1:22:37.499 --> 1:22:39.668
(pupils squelching)

1:22:39.709 --> 1:22:41.461
Burn it all down.

1:22:41.503 --> 1:22:44.172
-It's the only way.
-Easy. Easy.

1:22:45.674 --> 1:22:47.467
Burn me, you burn him, too.

1:22:47.509 --> 1:22:50.720

Shit!

1:23:07.195 --> 1:23:08.738
Cap's down.

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:10.365
We got a fire
in the restricted area.

1:23:10.407 --> 1:23:12.367
Call in the containment team.
