before we kept interrupting
with our loving proudness?.

11:51.132 --> 11:54.030
Yes, our tiny tapper.
What was it you were going to say...

11:54.130 --> 11:56.567
after "I wanted to be
a dancer, but-"?.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.902
But I just...

11:59.928 --> 12:02.725
need more practice.

12:02.827 --> 12:04.793
See ya.

12:04.902 --> 12:07.205
- [ Tapping]
- Oh. What's that awful sound?.

12:07.308 --> 12:09.184
- The furnace?.
- It,s me.

12:09.284 --> 12:11.194
[ Together]
Aww!

12:13.732 --> 12:16.990
Why is you so down,
Little Miss Vicki?.

12:17.092 --> 12:18.968
My kitty cat's sick...

12:19.069 --> 12:22.461
- and I'd be ever so sad if she should die.
- [ Coughing ]

12:22.561 --> 12:25.684
Well, I'm no animal doctor
or nothin'...

12:25.790 --> 12:28.777
but whenever I'm feelin' poorly,
you know what fixes me up?.

12:28.886 --> 12:30.762
- Dancin'.
- Dancin'?.

12:30.863 --> 12:32.963
Dancin'.

12:34.784 --> 12:38.231
- But I don't know how to dance.
- Oh, I'll show you how.

12:49.378 --> 12:51.287
There. Now you're gettin' it.

12:51.388 --> 12:54.016
Look at me, Powder Puff.
I'm dancin'.

12:54.122 --> 12:57.053
[ Meowing ]

13:01.567 --> 13:04.071
[ Sighs ]
The cat dances better than I do.

13:04.071 --> 13:04.127
[ Sighs ]
The cat dances better than I do.

13:10.430 --> 13:13.384
Gosh, that cheese looks good.
Think I could grab it before that anvil hits?.

13:13.493 --> 13:17.380
- I don't know, Chief. It's a million to one.
- I like those odds.

13:18.402 --> 13:19.356
[ Grunts ]

13:20.378 --> 13:22.153
- [ Snickering ]
- [ Wiggum Groaning]

13:22.256 --> 13:25.120
My mistake was grabbing the cheese.
[ Coughs ]

13:25.221 --> 13:27.097
## [ Humming In Gibberish ]

13:30.032 --> 13:33.356
Professor Frink, will that spaceship
be ready for the recital?.

13:33.458 --> 13:36.614
I have visited the future,
and yes, it will. [ Gibberish ]

13:36.719 --> 13:39.650
Okay, kids. Tonight's the big night.

13:39.750 --> 13:43.333
Now remember, the important thing
is to just dance flawlessly.

13:43.440 --> 13:46.034
Excuse me. Whyisn,t myname
in the program?

13:46.141 --> 13:49.129
It is, silly. You've got
the most important part of all.

13:49.238 --> 13:52.822
- "Curtain puller"?.
- No one can see the show ifthe curtain isn't open.

13:52.928 --> 13:55.590
But my parents are counting
on seeing me dance.

13:55.696 --> 13:57.897
And I've worked ever so hard.

13:58.001 --> 14:00.764
I'm sorry, Lisa,
but giving everyone an equal part...

14:00.867 --> 14:03.765
when they're clearly not equal
is called what again, class?.

14:03.865 --> 14:06.235
- Communism!
- That's right.

14:06.336 --> 14:08.572
And I didn't tap all those
Morse code messages to the Allies...

14:08.675 --> 14:10.124
till my shoes filled with blood...

14:10.224 --> 14:12.189
just to roll out
thewelcome mat forthe Reds.

14:12.299 --> 14:14.175
[ Sighs ]
All right.

14:14.276 --> 14:16.803
I'll be the stupid curtain puller.
[ Grunts ]

14:18.526 --> 14:22.963
Smoothly. Pulla-pulla-pulla.

14:23.072 --> 14:25.767
I getyour pulla-pulla-pulla.

14:25.872 --> 14:29.422
,Scuse me, Lisa, but I couldn,t help
but overhearyournerdlypredicament.

14:29.529 --> 14:32.292
Maybe I can be of assistance
with the dancing and the twisting...

14:32.395 --> 14:35.552
and the kung fu fighting.
[ Gibberish ]

14:37.996 --> 14:41.646
I first observed this technology
at the airport gift shop.

14:41.752 --> 14:44.211
As you see, it responds
to any percussive sound...

14:44.322 --> 14:47.905
with an exuberant shaking
ofits groove thing, yeah, yeah.

14:48.011 --> 14:49.921
It's most entertaining,
but how does that help me?.

14:50.021 --> 14:51.930
Observe.

14:52.031 --> 14:53.940
[ Muttering ]

14:58.191 --> 15:02.998
Ooh! That's brilliant, Professor.
What will you think of next?.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.717
Well, I also found this
at the gift shop. Isn't it cute?.

15:06.822 --> 15:09.125
I'm hoping to turn it into a weapon.

15:09.227 --> 15:11.755
[ Cackling Gibberish ]
It'll kill ya.

15:11.863 --> 15:13.311
I've gotta go now.

15:20.198 --> 15:22.074
[ Roaring ]

15:22.175 --> 15:24.342
- Should I get the backup lion, Chief?.
- Would you?.

15:29.225 --> 15:31.528
Can you see the lion anywhere?.

15:31.629 --> 15:33.303
[ Snarling ]

15:33.409 --> 15:35.509
- Well, doyou see him or not?.
- [ Whimpers ]

15:35.616 --> 15:38.705
[ Whining, Imitating Lion ]

15:38.811 --> 15:40.777
Areyou saying he's right on
the other side ofthat plant?.

15:40.887 --> 15:42.268
[Whining ]

15:42.370 --> 15:44.931
- [ Snarls ]
- Okay. Run!

15:45.039 --> 15:47.004
- [ Roars ]
- [ Screaming ]

15:49.288 --> 15:51.096
This way!

[ Panting ]

15:53.867 --> 15:55.743
Uh-oh.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.187
Bart, you're a genius.

16:08.296 --> 16:10.172
[ Screams ]

16:11.822 --> 16:16.327
- You okay, Milhouse?.
- Nothing that a handful of gummy bears can't fix.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.400
[ Both Chuckling ]

16:20.585 --> 16:22.820
Well, well. Looks like
the cat got the rat.

16:22.924 --> 16:25.132
And that's the end ofthat tale.

16:25.132 --> 16:25.423
And that's the end ofthat tale.

16:32.940 --> 16:37.321
Okay, everyone. We need big smiles out there,
so line up for dimpling.

16:37.420 --> 16:40.577
- Now this may hurt a lot. What am I saying, "may"?.
- [ Both Gasp ]

16:40.682 --> 16:42.557
Ow!

16:42.658 --> 16:44.534
Now that's a happy face.

16:44.635 --> 16:48.117
Little Vicki, I figured out how to dance.
I can be in the show now.

16:48.226 --> 16:51.640
I'm sorry, Lisa. People go to
a children's dance recital...

16:51.751 --> 16:53.716
expecting a certain level
of professionalism.

16:53.826 --> 16:55.702
But-Butyou don't understand-

16:55.803 --> 17:00.116
[ Groaning ]
I ate too much plastic candy.

17:00.217 --> 17:02.654
Heavens to betsy.
The star ofthe show is sick.

17:02.754 --> 17:06.236
Whateverwill we do?. There's only one person
who can get us out ofthis pickle.

17:06.345 --> 17:08.221
- Lisa?.
- Yes?.

- Showtime, children. Let's go.

Okay, curtain puller.
This is your moment to shine.

I'll do it foryou.

Wow. Look at her go.

we put on her really paid off.

- What are you doing?.
- I can't help it. It's the shoes.

- Self-tapping shoes?.

19:20.396 --> 19:22.272
I'm ever so pissed.

19:22.373 --> 19:25.596
I'm sorry, Vicki. I just wanted
to be a dancer so badly.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.576
[ Sighs ]
I understand.

19:27.677 --> 19:30.046
We all do crazy things
when we're desperate.

19:30.148 --> 19:32.147
I once destroyed Buddy Ebsen's
credit rating.

19:32.256 --> 19:35.018
- Why?.
- He knows why.

19:35.122 --> 19:38.211
Jesus, Mary and glavin!
These shoes are in the off position.

19:38.318 --> 19:40.194
You mean I danced all by myself?.

19:40.295 --> 19:42.665
See, honey?.
All you needed was to believe-

19:42.765 --> 19:44.641
What are you talkin' about,
Professor Frink?.

19:44.742 --> 19:47.437
They're clearly in the on position.
See?. "On."

19:47.543 --> 19:51.160
I was merely trying to spare
the girl's feelings, you insensitive clod.

19:51.265 --> 19:55.646
Oh. Ohh! Well, now that
I look even closer-

19:55.746 --> 19:57.622
Forget it, Dad.
[ Sighs ]

19:57.723 --> 20:00.284
I guess I'm never gonna be
a Broadway baby.

20:00.391 --> 20:04.300
That's not true, honey. You can always write
a depressing Broadway play of some kind.

20:04.410 --> 20:06.286
- You think so?.
- Sure.

20:06.387 --> 20:09.834
It could be a story about
people coming to terms with things.

Hey, yeah. You could load it up with
lots ofswears. That's what David Mamet does.
