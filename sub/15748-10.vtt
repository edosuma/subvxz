<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</b></font>

01:04.560 --> 01:05.788
Delay them!

01:06.360 --> 01:08.555
Gentlemen, how are we this morning?

01:08.720 --> 01:09.914
- Loxley.
- Good to see you.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.395
Any word from Selfridge?

01:12.480 --> 01:14.198
- Lord Loxley?
- Loxley?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.554
Ah.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.868
Mrs Edwards.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.712
You've recovered well, I see.

01:18.800 --> 01:20.074
Yes.

01:25.760 --> 01:26.749
Where's Mr Crabb?

01:32.360 --> 01:33.395
Well?

01:33.480 --> 01:36.233
This week's profits are up by 6.4%.

01:36.920 --> 01:38.592
Not as much as we'd hoped.

01:39.960 --> 01:41.791
Have you been in contact
with the board members

01:41.880 --> 01:43.632
who seem to be supporting Lord Loxley?

01:44.080 --> 01:46.071
Mr Barratt and Mr Lowe haven't
returned my calls,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.754
and we can't be sure that Loxley
hasn't won round the others.

01:49.640 --> 01:50.675
They're coming, chief.

01:54.920 --> 01:56.353
So, Selfridge.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.317
Finally you find the time to see us.

01:58.760 --> 02:00.557
Well, I'm here now.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.269
What can I help you with?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.836
You made a promise to your shareholders

02:05.440 --> 02:07.510
to raise profits by 10%,

02:07.600 --> 02:10.239
but when I ask to see the figures, you and

02:10.320 --> 02:12.595
your man withheld them.

02:12.680 --> 02:15.069
And then you didn't turn up for
the board meeting.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.037
Let me stop your right there.

02:17.160 --> 02:20.232
We have prepared figures and they're
right in front of you, please.

02:25.400 --> 02:29.951
You will see from the tabled figures
that profits are now rising steadily.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.917
They're up 6.4%.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.878
6.4% is not what you promised.

02:34.960 --> 02:39.317
You are not going to be able to raise
profits by 10% in time for the dividend.

02:40.720 --> 02:43.314
Dividends don't go in till the end of October.

02:43.400 --> 02:46.437
Now, September, traditionally,
has been a very good month for us.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.637
- We introduce our autumn stock...
- And that raises profits.

02:49.720 --> 02:53.474
Furthermore, we intend to keep the sales
running at the same time.

02:54.080 --> 02:57.197
I have prepared some forecast figures.

03:01.440 --> 03:02.429
Thank you.

03:10.120 --> 03:12.873
Are we supposed to believe these?

03:13.720 --> 03:15.870
You're gambling again, Selfridge.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.835
You run this business in a dangerously
autocratic fashion.

03:20.360 --> 03:22.828
You won't allow anyone to question
your judgment.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.509
Which is why this board
would like to propose

03:25.600 --> 03:28.194
a vote of no confidence in you as chairman.

03:31.840 --> 03:34.593
All the materials will be on site
by the end of tomorrow.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.557
And the advance to pay my boys?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.950
Money will be in your account
the evening before we start.

03:39.200 --> 03:40.519
Sounds good to me.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.717
I'm glad you're here, Mr Gerrard.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.995
Obviously, the ground is waterlogged.

03:45.080 --> 03:47.958
I wonder, it doesn't seem to be in the plans...

03:48.040 --> 03:50.713
Uh, where do you want me
to dig the sump well?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.034
I thought we agreed here.

04:01.120 --> 04:02.997
In the end? Did we not?

04:03.840 --> 04:05.432
Good, then, good.

04:10.400 --> 04:11.799
This is bloody ridiculous.

04:11.880 --> 04:14.030
- I don't know what I'm talking about.
- Well, I do.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.792
I've been up half the night, every night,

04:15.880 --> 04:17.916
- reading up on all this.
- You can't make this work.

04:18.680 --> 04:20.432
Yes, I can. We agreed.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.955
I'm going to build these houses
and get married to Harry.

04:24.040 --> 04:25.029
And you're going to America.

04:25.120 --> 04:26.473
We're going to prison.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.039
That's where this is going to end.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.993
No, it's not. Not if we hold our nerve.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.070
Gentlemen, before you vote,

04:41.160 --> 04:42.912
I've prepared a financial statement.

04:43.000 --> 04:46.549
They show you how you've all profited
from buying into this company.

04:49.600 --> 04:52.273
I am a risk taker. And I'm proud of it.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.948
Business is all about assessed risk.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.757
This is the past. What about the future?

05:00.200 --> 05:01.872
You could lose it all tomorrow.

05:02.160 --> 05:03.878
The next role of the dice.

05:04.160 --> 05:05.912
Stay firm, gentlemen.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.557
Let's say you vote me out.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.238
How do you propose to move on?

05:10.480 --> 05:11.833
We bring a new chairman in.

05:11.920 --> 05:13.558
You haven't thought this through.

05:13.800 --> 05:16.155
This isn't business, it's personal.

05:16.240 --> 05:17.992
- You're a profiteer.
- I'm a changed man.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.069
Oh.

05:19.160 --> 05:21.594
I've established a charitable foundation
for war veterans.

05:21.680 --> 05:25.309
Your charity supported a man
who assaulted a member of our staff.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.231
She put herself in harm's way.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.993
Working late at night, slathered in makeup.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.039
So, it's her fault, is it?

05:32.120 --> 05:33.838
She should have been more careful.

05:36.080 --> 05:37.433
That kind of talk...

05:37.520 --> 05:38.919
No wonder Lady Mae left you.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.150
That woman is a liar and a whore.

05:43.240 --> 05:44.559
Her new husband doesn't think so.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.076
She wouldn't have a new husband
if you hadn't paid for a divorce.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.639
- She's a friend of mine...
- She was mine!

05:49.760 --> 05:51.079
And you took her from me.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.116
And now you're going to know how it feels,
Selfridge, to lose what's yours.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.239
And he says it wasn't personal.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.958
Lord Loxley, we're at a business meeting.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.879
Sit down, sir.

06:06.040 --> 06:07.359
Gentlemen.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.713
Just remember what's at stake.

06:10.280 --> 06:15.434
What's at stake is that Lord Loxley has been
manipulating all of you for his own ends.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.556
Let us proceed with the vote.

06:19.560 --> 06:21.312
Mr Selfridge?

06:29.640 --> 06:32.632
Good. I'll come down
to the workshop tomorrow.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.078
They're starting on the aeroplane.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.238
That's wonderful, darling.

06:39.920 --> 06:41.478
What's the matter?

06:43.280 --> 06:45.032
I know that look, Mama.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.310
The architect for the Selfridge Estate...

06:55.200 --> 06:56.553
I don't think he's right.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.196
He's meant to work there. I went...

07:01.080 --> 07:02.559
It was boarded up.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.388
Hmm. Could be an old card.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.633
I made inquiries.

07:08.320 --> 07:09.753
Nobody knows of him.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.149
Who recommended him?

07:13.720 --> 07:14.835
Miss Webb.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.754
Ah.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.119
Don't cause trouble, Mama.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.750
It's the first time it's actually working
between us and the Selfridge's.

07:31.240 --> 07:33.629
And if Harry thinks you're snooping,
it will ruin everything.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.033
Leave well alone!

08:09.680 --> 08:11.477
The vote is defeated.

08:12.000 --> 08:13.718
Seven votes to two.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.796
I gave you all a chance.

08:21.040 --> 08:22.553
But you were too wet to take it.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.916
Your shares will fall in value.

08:28.760 --> 08:31.399
This man will lose you money.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.032
Mark my words.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.635
If anyone else is unhappy with the way
I run this company,

08:38.720 --> 08:40.551
I suggest you leave this table now.

08:49.080 --> 08:51.071
Thank you for your faith, gentlemen.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.149
I shall repay it.

09:01.240 --> 09:02.593
I've got some gossip for you.

09:03.440 --> 09:05.749
Prince Carol of Romania is in town.

09:05.840 --> 09:08.035
He's with two girls, stage stars.

09:08.120 --> 09:11.795
They're visiting clubs looking for games,
and he's losing thousands.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.677
And so are the girls, on his credit.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.109
Isn't baccarat his thing?

09:17.200 --> 09:18.428
Mmm-hmm.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.112
We could run a private evening.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.393
Your friends get word to him?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.199
I'll ask them.

09:26.720 --> 09:28.233
This could be the big one.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.393
Finally get Regan off our backs.

09:30.640 --> 09:31.914
They're giving you trouble?

09:32.120 --> 09:33.792
I just want him to leave us alone.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.039
So do I.

09:43.560 --> 09:47.678
We are hearing how you sent
Lord Loxley and Mr Lowe packing.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.593
Well, the question is who will
they sell their shares to.

09:50.680 --> 09:53.114
We don't need to worry about that,
we have more to celebrate.

09:53.920 --> 09:56.309
We begin work on
the Selfridge Estate in two days.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.152
- Superb.
- Ma would be so proud.

09:58.800 --> 09:59.869
Wouldn't she be?

10:00.960 --> 10:03.633
Your mother was a special, unique woman.

10:04.680 --> 10:07.069
And after she died,
I never thought I'd find love again.

10:07.760 --> 10:10.228
But I've been lucky. I found Nancy.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.919
Pa, what are you saying?

10:14.240 --> 10:16.435
Are you marrying Nancy?

10:17.600 --> 10:18.749
Yes, I am.

10:20.720 --> 10:24.110
- Pa, that's great news.
- Thank you. Thank you.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.796
Is there something you know
that you're not telling me?

10:31.040 --> 10:32.314
I could be wrong.

10:32.560 --> 10:35.199
If you're not sure about her,
trust your instincts.

10:36.200 --> 10:38.270
I'm sure you'll both be very happy.

10:44.400 --> 10:46.391
- Make sure you type these up for Mr Fields.
- Yes, of course.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.038
- Thank you so much.
- These are done.

10:50.040 --> 10:52.952
Violette didn't seem to happy
with my news last night.

10:54.800 --> 10:55.789
She'll come round.

10:57.440 --> 10:59.032
Now, I thought she liked Nancy.

10:59.120 --> 11:02.590
Honestly, I think your sister's going to
send us to an early grave.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.513
Uh, I'm seeing someone, too.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.116
- You are?
- It's serious.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.910
The Maxwell-Taylor girl, the younger one.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.309
- I always thought you liked her.
- No, no. It's nothing...

11:14.400 --> 11:16.914
- The older one! Flora!
- Well, well actually...

11:17.000 --> 11:17.989
Mr Selfridge.

11:18.080 --> 11:19.638
Miss Webb and Mr Edwards are ready for you.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.358
Coming along now.

11:23.000 --> 11:24.479
You're a dark horse, Gordon.

11:24.560 --> 11:25.595
We'll talk later.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.279
<i>When do they
actually start digging?</i>

11:29.560 --> 11:31.152
In two days time.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.277
I want you down at the site, Harry,
spade in hand.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.920
First piece of earth to be turned
for the Selfridge Estate.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.036
Miss Webb, I need details about you
for the press release.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.995
- Details?
- A short biography.

11:42.760 --> 11:43.829
Mmm!

11:44.440 --> 11:46.158
Mr Selfridge, the bank's on the line.

11:46.240 --> 11:47.309
It's about the estate.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.958
Shall I tell them to call back later?

11:49.040 --> 11:50.678
No. Uh, put them through to here.

11:52.840 --> 11:55.434
Uh, I need a biography for
the architect as well.

11:55.520 --> 11:56.999
- What's his name?
- Uh, Mr Tom Gerrard.

11:57.080 --> 11:58.672
I'd like to talk to him as well.

11:58.760 --> 12:01.228
Make sure he's happy with the excavation.

12:01.320 --> 12:02.548
Can you bring him into the store?

12:02.640 --> 12:03.675
Mmm-hmm.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.189
Hello?

12:12.760 --> 12:14.671
I see. Thank you very much.

12:17.760 --> 12:21.799
£15,000 into the Selfridge Estate
bank account, we got our full budget.

12:24.640 --> 12:26.471
- That's such wonderful news.
- I'm so happy.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.995
You and Miss Webb have a good
working relationship.

12:30.080 --> 12:31.229
We do.

12:33.120 --> 12:34.473
Harry, is something going on?

12:35.480 --> 12:37.072
This isn't for print, but...

12:37.800 --> 12:39.836
You might as well know,
we're getting married.

12:40.280 --> 12:41.599
Ah!

12:48.240 --> 12:51.391
Princess Marie Wiazemsky. Good afternoon.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.357
I wonder if you could help me.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.589
I want to make an inquiry about an architect

12:57.680 --> 13:00.240
who is registered here with the institute.

13:00.320 --> 13:04.393
His name is a Mr Thomas Gerrard.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.232
- I'll check.
- Thank you so much.

13:12.360 --> 13:13.475
Come.

13:19.160 --> 13:20.354
Miss Mardle.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.318
I'm handing in my notice.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.599
Is this...

13:28.320 --> 13:30.629
Have you entirely thought this through?

13:31.240 --> 13:33.515
I find it impossible to work with you.

13:36.520 --> 13:40.433
I know it's been difficult to work alongside
each other recently, but...

13:40.520 --> 13:43.239
You treat me as if I'm some sort of pariah.
Well, I'm not.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.599
I won't put up with it any more.

13:46.680 --> 13:47.954
I don't need to.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.154
Josie.

13:54.680 --> 13:55.874
Please.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.709
Reconsider.

13:58.840 --> 14:00.353
Please inform Mr Selfridge.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.471
I got it from
the horse's mouth.

14:07.560 --> 14:09.596
Well, I think that's wonderful.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.955
Mr Selfridge deserves his happiness.

14:17.800 --> 14:19.518
Keep your eyes peeled this week, ladies.

14:19.600 --> 14:20.635
I've had a tip-off.

14:20.720 --> 14:22.517
There's a gang of shoplifters
working Oxford Street.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.955
At least you're here.
Makes us all feel much safer.

14:25.360 --> 14:26.588
All right, Jessie, back to work.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.669
- You've got a proper fan club.
- It's funny.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.431
None of the girls at the club
were that interested in me.

14:33.520 --> 14:35.750
Nice girls are your sort, that's why.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.068
Oh, excuse me.

14:38.320 --> 14:40.197
- Good morning, Miss Webb.
- Good morning.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.872
I just wanted to say

14:41.960 --> 14:43.837
congratulations.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.911
And if you need somebody to
make you up for your big day,

14:46.000 --> 14:47.035
you know who to come to.

14:47.120 --> 14:49.714
Yes, we haven't finalised any of
the details yet.

14:49.800 --> 14:52.075
- So, please...
- Oh, don't worry, I'll keep it to myself.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.553
But I must warn you,

14:53.640 --> 14:55.870
news does travel fast around here.

15:00.720 --> 15:02.039
Jessie.

15:06.960 --> 15:08.279
Is Mr Selfridge in?

15:09.560 --> 15:11.073
I'm afraid he's left early today.

15:11.160 --> 15:13.628
Do you know where I can find him?
It is very important that I see him.

15:14.040 --> 15:15.758
He'll be with Miss Webb, I should think.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.119
I presume you know.

15:20.480 --> 15:22.232
Oh, yes.

15:22.800 --> 15:23.869
Wonderful news.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.952
It reminds one, how...

15:27.000 --> 15:28.752
Love can blossom in later life.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.992
It's very urgent that I see him.
Perhaps you have Miss Webb's address?

15:33.480 --> 15:36.313
I'm not at liberties to divulge
that sort of information.

15:36.960 --> 15:38.871
I suggest you come back in the morning.

15:49.480 --> 15:51.038
Do you love me, Harry?

15:53.240 --> 15:54.798
Would I be here if I didn't?

15:56.400 --> 15:57.879
- Hmm.
- How do you love me?

15:59.160 --> 16:01.674
When you walked into my office
with those plans,

16:02.680 --> 16:04.159
I felt that I knew you.

16:05.160 --> 16:06.479
A connection.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.195
I didn't think I'd feel that again.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.833
Then there you were.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.072
Like daylight through a window.

16:21.400 --> 16:23.277
- Harry...
- What is it?

16:25.880 --> 16:27.154
I'm not sure I can do this.

16:28.040 --> 16:29.314
What do you mean?

16:30.920 --> 16:32.399
I'm not what you think I am.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.273
Darling, what is it?

16:38.520 --> 16:39.669
I...

16:43.280 --> 16:45.350
I've lived on my own too long.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.598
I'm selfish, and...

16:48.880 --> 16:50.233
Difficult.

16:51.920 --> 16:53.319
None of that matters.

16:54.200 --> 16:56.839
As long as you feel the same about me
as I do about you.

16:58.960 --> 17:00.234
Do you?

17:00.320 --> 17:01.639
You've never said it.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.358
I love you,

17:07.440 --> 17:08.873
Harry Selfridge.

17:09.800 --> 17:10.949
More than anything.

17:12.560 --> 17:13.834
I love you.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.032
- Mr Selfridge.
- Mr Selfridge.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.953
- Good morning, Mrs Edwards.
- Good morning.

17:30.040 --> 17:31.951
- Good morning, Mr Selfridge.
- Morning.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.632
- Miss Calthorpe.
- Good morning.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.835
Good morning, gentlemen.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.319
- Hello, chief.
- Morning, sir.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.434
What's the matter with everyone?

17:40.520 --> 17:43.671
News has travelled. A certain engagement?

17:44.600 --> 17:46.352
We're all thrilled to bits, chief!

17:47.840 --> 17:49.637
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

17:49.720 --> 17:51.790
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

17:53.720 --> 17:55.631
Thank you, thank you all.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.430
Right, right. Back to work now, please.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.999
Back to work.

18:06.640 --> 18:08.153
Princess Marie is in your office.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.037
She's very keen to see you.

18:10.120 --> 18:13.590
The heads of department meeting has
been moved forward by one hour.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.671
And uh, I'd like to say...

18:15.760 --> 18:18.035
- Congratulations!
- Ah, thank you.

18:21.560 --> 18:24.632
So much for my secret engagement,
the whole store seems to know.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.629
What's this?

18:30.720 --> 18:33.280
It's a list of Mr Thomas Gerrard's
previous engagements.

18:33.360 --> 18:37.592
According to this, he trained 20 years ago,
he's done dozens of jobs, but...

18:38.640 --> 18:39.959
It's not possible.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.914
He's too young.

18:43.160 --> 18:46.197
I saw him at a jeweller's shop.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.670
They called him by a different name.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.953
It was very strange, so,

18:52.040 --> 18:54.873
I went to the Royal Institute
of British Architects.

18:55.840 --> 18:57.432
I did tell Miss Webb.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.479
You spoke with Nancy?

19:00.000 --> 19:02.639
She seemed confident in Mr Gerrard, but I...

19:05.080 --> 19:06.911
I wasn't quite sure.

19:08.640 --> 19:11.359
Why, I suppose it's possible she
didn't check his references.

19:12.160 --> 19:14.151
But she has a lot to be getting on with.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.554
Of course she does.

19:16.920 --> 19:19.275
I hope I did the right thing, Harry,

19:19.360 --> 19:20.793
bringing this to you.

19:31.360 --> 19:35.319
I'm looking for something classy,
but distinctive.

19:35.720 --> 19:37.039
How about beaded?

19:38.200 --> 19:39.633
I like that.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.834
Victor. What do you think?

19:42.920 --> 19:44.751
Prince Carol's not going
to know what's hit him.

19:46.800 --> 19:49.234
One of our mannequins could model
it for you, madame.

19:49.840 --> 19:51.876
Yes, thank you.

19:59.040 --> 20:00.439
'Scuse me.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.880
Security! Those women, they're thieving!

20:05.320 --> 20:06.435
Quick, go!

20:06.840 --> 20:07.909
Hey! Stop!

20:08.080 --> 20:09.513
Stop those women!

20:10.080 --> 20:11.149
Get them!

20:13.520 --> 20:14.748
Stop!

20:20.320 --> 20:21.719
Stop them!

20:26.120 --> 20:27.348
But why?

20:28.160 --> 20:29.991
She's the heart of this store.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.315
The best head of department we've ever had.

20:34.280 --> 20:35.713
The finest manag...

20:39.680 --> 20:40.715
This is your doing.

20:40.800 --> 20:42.028
Arthur!

20:44.000 --> 20:46.833
I tried to dissuade her, but...

20:48.200 --> 20:50.555
She just wouldn't listen.

20:50.880 --> 20:52.359
Honestly!

20:52.640 --> 20:54.915
Sometimes I could knock your head
against a wall!

20:55.400 --> 20:57.789
I would if I thought it would
bring you to your senses!

20:58.520 --> 21:00.954
You've behaved horribly to Josie
in the last few months.

21:01.040 --> 21:04.157
I'm fully aware that my behaviour
has been less than exemplary.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.349
There are things you don't know.

21:06.440 --> 21:08.078
I know what happened with Doris.

21:10.720 --> 21:12.676
I know Doris was unfaithful to you.

21:15.200 --> 21:17.077
I don't want to think about it.

21:17.160 --> 21:18.149
I can't bear to.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.639
Well, you have to.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.873
Because you're taking your anger out
on the wrong person.

21:23.440 --> 21:25.431
And unless you do something about it,

21:25.520 --> 21:27.670
you're going to lose your greatest friend.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.036
And you'll regret it, Roger.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.588
You'll regret it for the rest of your life.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.911
They looked so proper.

21:38.000 --> 21:39.558
I didn't think for one minute
they were wrong 'uns,

21:39.640 --> 21:41.676
but she had half the store
under her cape.

21:41.760 --> 21:44.354
Now I understand why you don't want
to come back to the club, George.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.078
It's all go here.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.559
You should get that seen to.

21:47.680 --> 21:49.238
Nah, it's nothing.

21:49.320 --> 21:50.594
He's had much worse.

21:52.080 --> 21:53.479
Listen George, it's been good to see ya.

21:53.560 --> 21:54.549
We got to go.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.710
But drop into the club whenever you want.

21:56.800 --> 21:57.949
All right?

21:58.880 --> 22:00.552
And bring Miss Hawkins with ya.

22:00.640 --> 22:02.517
Night out on me.

22:02.600 --> 22:03.919
Cheers, Victor.

22:05.680 --> 22:06.908
Take care, George.

22:10.000 --> 22:11.319
Well...

22:11.960 --> 22:14.394
The famous Mr Colleano.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.555
I suppose you want to go to his club now.

22:17.920 --> 22:19.035
No.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.991
It's not my kind of place, George.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.638
I wouldn't feel comfortable.

22:24.720 --> 22:26.358
What is your kind of place?

22:27.720 --> 22:30.473
Uh, the Palais de Danse at Hammersmith.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.397
Would you fancy going there tonight?

22:35.880 --> 22:37.552
You any good at dancing?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.709
Let me take you. You'll find out.

22:50.400 --> 22:51.992
Uh, Pa, can I... Can I talk to you?

22:52.280 --> 22:53.872
Just the person I needed.

22:53.960 --> 22:57.589
There's going to be press at the
Selfridge Estate site, and I need you there.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.671
I think your sister should be there as well.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.193
- Miss Plunkett. Could...
- I'm sorry.

23:02.040 --> 23:03.519
I need to tell you something.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.639
I'm courting Grace Calthorpe.

23:13.720 --> 23:14.755
You're what?

23:15.440 --> 23:16.839
I've been trying to tell you for ages...

23:16.920 --> 23:17.955
Gordon, no.

23:18.040 --> 23:19.758
You said Ma made you the person you are.

23:19.840 --> 23:22.593
Well, that's how I feel about Grace.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.639
She's my friend.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.035
But it's more than friendship, I love her.

23:28.120 --> 23:30.190
You can't have a relationship
with Miss Calthorpe.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.599
You are her employer.

23:31.680 --> 23:34.478
- Pa, hear me out, I don't care if she's staff.
- Other people will.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.551
- Times have changed.
- No, they haven't.

23:36.640 --> 23:37.789
Believe me.

23:37.880 --> 23:41.156
If you want to be a leader, you have to
hold yourself apart from those you lead.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.879
I started in the loading bay.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.679
I've never held myself apart.
The staff still do as I ask.

23:46.760 --> 23:48.273
I blame myself for this.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.113
I've been distracted, I haven't given you
the guidance you need.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.428
This isn't about you.

23:52.520 --> 23:55.353
This is about me, and how I feel for Grace.

23:56.920 --> 23:59.878
You are deputy manager of this store.

23:59.960 --> 24:01.632
You have to put your feelings aside.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.711
I am sorry, son. I really am.

24:03.800 --> 24:07.076
But if you want to keep your position,
you have to break it off with her.

24:08.120 --> 24:11.510
Why is it OK for Pa to marry
any old person, and not me?

24:11.600 --> 24:14.114
- Pa loves her.
- I loved Victor.

24:14.200 --> 24:18.876
It seemed like you were using him as
some kind of rebellion against us all.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.154
In the beginning, maybe it was like that.

24:22.240 --> 24:25.118
I knew Pa would disapprove,
and it made it more exciting.

24:25.920 --> 24:27.638
But then...

24:27.720 --> 24:29.711
Well, I did fall in love.

24:30.560 --> 24:32.596
I gave myself to him.

24:33.360 --> 24:34.839
All of myself.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.152
- You...
- It wasn't just a romance.

24:38.760 --> 24:41.433
If I've learned anything from marriage,

24:42.680 --> 24:45.240
you have to fight for the person you love.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.918
Why's the house up for sale?

25:11.240 --> 25:12.559
Come in.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.431
I've made my decision.

25:23.960 --> 25:26.599
I'm not just leaving Selfridge's,
I'm also leaving London.

25:27.720 --> 25:29.199
But you mustn't.

25:29.760 --> 25:32.354
I mean, not because of me.

25:34.600 --> 25:35.715
I behaved very badly.

25:35.800 --> 25:39.952
I took all my misery about Doris out on you.

25:40.120 --> 25:41.712
None of it was your fault.

25:42.920 --> 25:44.831
- You were just...
- A convenient target.

25:45.240 --> 25:47.674
Well, I... Wouldn't put it quite like that.

25:47.760 --> 25:48.795
I would.

25:50.080 --> 25:51.752
That's all I've ever been for you.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.877
Someone to rely on. To moan to.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.877
- Someone to sleep with.
- Josie...

25:58.960 --> 26:02.316
I put up with it for all these years, stupidly.

26:02.680 --> 26:09.199
Look, it's possible that a part of me
always believed that you would be there,

26:09.280 --> 26:15.719
and so, perhaps, yes, perhaps
I might've taken advantage of that.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.830
If so, I'm sorry.

26:18.920 --> 26:21.673
You are a petty, selfish little man.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.600
You know nothing of friendship, loyalty...

26:26.600 --> 26:27.669
Love.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.753
I don't need you any more.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.079
Go away, Roger.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.071
- Josie...
- I mean it, please, leave me alone.

26:38.160 --> 26:40.628
But I can't, not like this,
I might never see you again.

26:40.720 --> 26:41.914
Very probably.

26:45.040 --> 26:46.234
Well, at least...

26:46.960 --> 26:49.679
Say we part friends.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.832
Well if I did, it would be a lie.

26:55.840 --> 26:58.115
- What will I do without you?
- Oh, I don't know!

26:58.200 --> 27:00.555
Muddle through, I suppose.
I don't care any more.

27:04.280 --> 27:05.952
Please leave my house.

27:08.600 --> 27:10.272
Shut the door on your way out.

27:26.400 --> 27:27.719
This is ridiculous.

27:28.920 --> 27:30.353
It's impossible.

27:31.600 --> 27:34.797
I will not leave until we part friends.

27:36.760 --> 27:38.239
I will not.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.797
It's going to be an awfully long night.

27:55.720 --> 27:58.439
So, Mr Gerrard, you've been to the site.

27:58.520 --> 27:59.555
I have, sir.

28:00.240 --> 28:02.356
And you're happy with the excavation plans.

28:02.680 --> 28:03.749
I am.

28:03.840 --> 28:06.559
The ground's damp,
but we made provision for that.

28:06.640 --> 28:09.029
Well, you have some experience on
waterlogged ground,

28:09.120 --> 28:10.838
you worked on the Fortescue Estate.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.751
There's a lake there, I believe.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.153
And what were you designing
for Lord Fortescue?

28:20.560 --> 28:22.312
Oh, I, uh...

28:24.120 --> 28:25.269
I can't remember.

28:25.360 --> 28:27.430
Well, you must remember,
it was only last year.

28:29.880 --> 28:31.393
Let me think.

28:32.280 --> 28:33.429
What was it?

28:34.040 --> 28:35.837
That's it. A palm house.

28:37.200 --> 28:38.838
You built a ballroom.

28:39.400 --> 28:41.311
Mr Tom Gerrard did, anyway.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.630
I was just speaking to him on the telephone.

28:46.760 --> 28:48.955
Look, I was desperate.

28:49.040 --> 28:50.519
Nobody would give me a job.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.158
People's lives are at stake here.

28:52.240 --> 28:54.754
Servicemen who want to start again,
and for what?

28:54.840 --> 28:56.671
An architect's fee?

28:58.240 --> 28:59.593
You're a despicable liar.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.272
My friends will help me!

29:01.400 --> 29:02.833
You think you're clever, Selfridge!

29:02.920 --> 29:04.558
It's not just me!

29:06.400 --> 29:09.278
- I can't believe it, I'm so sorry!
- No, you weren't to know.

29:09.360 --> 29:10.839
He tricked us both.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.558
God, I can't stand a cheat.

29:22.200 --> 29:25.112
I think this chap's real name
might be Augustus Paynton.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.997
He's been linked to quite a few frauds.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.877
Had people's money
up and down the country.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.996
The thing is, they're not sure.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.152
He usually works with his sister.

29:33.240 --> 29:34.753
The two of them do jobs together.

29:35.360 --> 29:36.475
His sister?

29:36.560 --> 29:38.755
Pretty girl, the police say.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.353
Reckon she's the brains.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.954
He didn't introduce you
to a young lady, did he?

29:45.600 --> 29:48.797
- No.
- Well then, it might not be him.

29:48.880 --> 29:51.348
If I hear anything else,
you'll be the first to know, sir.

29:52.240 --> 29:53.639
Thank you, Mr Towler.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.310
I'll leave you to your affairs.

30:09.440 --> 30:12.159
You want to withdraw
the whole amount, Miss Webb?

30:12.440 --> 30:13.589
Are you sure?

30:13.680 --> 30:16.114
My contractors have been extremely patient,

30:16.640 --> 30:18.437
but I owe them all money.

30:18.520 --> 30:20.636
And the building materials are on hold, and...

30:21.360 --> 30:24.511
I'm beginning to have sleepless nights.

30:25.280 --> 30:26.998
We wouldn't want that, would we?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.990
Very well. I'll arrange it.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.435
Oh, thank you so much.

30:44.160 --> 30:45.149
<i>Nancy!</i>

30:59.800 --> 31:00.994
Taxi!

31:53.400 --> 31:54.674
I'm going to bed now.

31:54.760 --> 31:56.512
I'll still be here in the morning.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.029
You think you can wear me down?

32:01.120 --> 32:02.189
Well, you can't.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.959
I know I'm a fool.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.436
But I won't give up on our friendship.

32:09.360 --> 32:14.070
If you forgive me now, I will try to be to you
what you have always been to me.

32:14.160 --> 32:15.593
My better half.

32:16.280 --> 32:18.589
The most important person in my life.

32:18.720 --> 32:19.994
My soul's mate.

32:23.720 --> 32:27.190
Don't let this be the end, please.

32:29.640 --> 32:35.192
Roger, you really are the most obstinate,
ridiculous...

32:37.120 --> 32:38.599
Glory of a man.

32:42.320 --> 32:44.072
Dearest Josie.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.471
My heart's love.

32:54.840 --> 32:56.398
I don't deserve you.

32:57.720 --> 32:59.790
Not even the smallest bit of you.

33:02.960 --> 33:06.430
No, you really don't.

33:18.040 --> 33:19.393
Hello, Victor.

33:23.400 --> 33:24.515
Can we talk?

33:25.120 --> 33:26.109
Lads.

33:47.880 --> 33:51.270
I haven't been able to stop
thinking of you since the other night.

33:51.880 --> 33:53.677
I've missed you so much.

33:55.080 --> 33:57.275
And when I saw you again, I realised it.

34:19.520 --> 34:20.918
We're too different.

34:23.679 --> 34:24.954
All this...

34:26.560 --> 34:28.755
It's not a world you could ever belong to.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.993
I could try.

34:42.520 --> 34:44.078
Beautiful hands.

34:46.600 --> 34:48.397
Never seen a day's work.

34:49.960 --> 34:51.678
You think I'm spoilt.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.433
And it's true.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.671
I've been given so much.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.476
Just not the things I've always wanted.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.352
But I can change.

35:07.720 --> 35:09.836
I can become a better person.

35:11.480 --> 35:13.118
For you, I can.

35:15.160 --> 35:17.549
Please, Victor. Give me this chance.

35:22.400 --> 35:23.958
Sorry, Violette.

35:25.760 --> 35:26.795
No.

35:38.240 --> 35:40.390
Is that your last word on it?

35:49.880 --> 35:50.995
I hate who I am!

35:51.080 --> 35:53.514
Don't say that. You're wonderful.

35:53.600 --> 35:55.909
And some man is going to be
very lucky to have you.

36:13.600 --> 36:16.239
Grace, can we talk?

36:16.920 --> 36:18.273
Please?

36:19.400 --> 36:24.030
I knew he wouldn't accept it.
I do understand, it's just...

36:25.040 --> 36:26.758
It's hard, that's all.

36:27.080 --> 36:28.229
It's not.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.672
Because I've made my decision.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.149
I'm leaving the store.

36:35.920 --> 36:38.912
- No, you can't.
- I can do what I like.

36:40.640 --> 36:43.234
I'm fed up with living in my father's shadow.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.155
It's time he understood I'm my own person.

36:46.240 --> 36:47.593
I make my own choices.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.359
I choose you.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.350
Tell me this isn't true.
Tell me this isn't happening.

37:29.160 --> 37:30.479
I didn't take it.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.118
But you were going to. You were gonna run.

37:32.200 --> 37:34.430
When Gus was arrested, I panicked, yes, but...

37:35.960 --> 37:39.430
I couldn't leave you. I just couldn't.

37:40.880 --> 37:42.916
I thought that we were right for each other.

37:43.720 --> 37:47.190
I thought that I knew you,
and that you knew me.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.590
- Was any of it real?
- Of course it was.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.149
I've broken all of my own rules.

37:54.240 --> 37:57.277
I've risked everything to come here.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.318
You've changed me.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.191
I can't go back to the woman I was.

38:05.320 --> 38:06.639
Who was she?

38:08.080 --> 38:10.878
Tell me, you owe me that.

38:13.360 --> 38:15.920
My real name is Emily Paynton.

38:18.200 --> 38:21.272
My brother and I ran away
from my parents when I was 13.

38:22.800 --> 38:26.634
We had nothing, we had to live on our wits,
so we became...

38:28.480 --> 38:29.515
Grifters.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.434
And I have always hated it. I hated it.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.513
I wanted it to stop.

38:35.800 --> 38:38.439
And then when we saw the publicity
for the government housing...

38:38.520 --> 38:41.637
- It was just an opportunity...
- To lead some idiot by the nose.

38:41.720 --> 38:45.030
It was never meant to be you.
It was meant to be Lord Meadows.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.270
And was he meant to fall in love with you too?

38:50.560 --> 38:55.031
- Because I fell. So hard.
- None of that was part of the plan.

38:56.840 --> 38:58.592
You have to believe me.

38:59.680 --> 39:01.955
Harry, you said last night, that we have...

39:02.520 --> 39:05.478
Something special between us,
there's a connection.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.551
Neither of us can deny that.

39:12.440 --> 39:14.510
We can still build the estate.

39:16.400 --> 39:17.879
We can do it together.

39:20.920 --> 39:22.558
You hate to be alone.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.237
- You need a wife.
- Wife?

39:28.520 --> 39:31.114
I'm still the same person, underneath.

39:31.200 --> 39:33.316
I can't believe I ever thought
I could replace Rose.

39:33.400 --> 39:35.550
Harry, just give me one more chance.

39:36.640 --> 39:38.119
I swear, I won't let you down.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.236
I don't care about you any more.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.874
Do you understand?

39:42.720 --> 39:44.756
You're not who I thought you were.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.068
You're a cheat.

39:47.240 --> 39:48.593
You're a liar.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.113
You're a stranger.

39:56.240 --> 39:57.878
I'm not gonna call the police.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.632
But I never want to see you again.

40:00.240 --> 40:02.356
Crawl back under your stone.

40:03.640 --> 40:05.756
But I love you.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.118
You don't know what the word means.

40:10.200 --> 40:11.997
I didn't before, but I do now.

40:12.080 --> 40:14.719
Please, don't do this, Harry.

40:15.200 --> 40:17.714
Get out! Get out of my store.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.391
Before I throw you out myself.

40:29.440 --> 40:31.715
You're vulnerable to women.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.158
And you always will be.

40:38.240 --> 40:39.832
You're lucky it was me.

40:52.760 --> 40:58.392
If your client buys all our shares,
then they'll have a 15% stake in the company.

40:58.920 --> 41:02.196
Harry Selfridge and his family
will still have the majority.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.238
The family are loyal now,
but the cracks are showing.

41:05.760 --> 41:08.911
And Selfridge himself has his weaknesses.

41:09.840 --> 41:15.119
Your client wants control of their company.
All he need do is wait.

41:31.360 --> 41:33.635
Hmm. Well done, Loxley.

41:45.880 --> 41:48.269
It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.758
We're a pathetic bunch.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.717
We can't get anyone to love us.

41:53.800 --> 41:54.789
Violette.

41:54.880 --> 41:57.348
I'm still in love with Victor Colleano.

41:58.480 --> 42:00.710
I don't think I'll ever get over him.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.434
Well, if you feel so much for him, go to him.

42:03.800 --> 42:04.835
I've tried.

42:06.960 --> 42:08.359
He doesn't want me.

42:09.320 --> 42:12.790
Jacques de Sibour though,
he's keen to snap me up.

42:13.480 --> 42:16.153
So, I'm going to Paris to await his proposal.

42:16.240 --> 42:18.356
But you don't even know him.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.953
I can't stay in London.

42:20.560 --> 42:24.314
- I don't want to see Victor ever again.
- Oh, honey, shhh.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.033
Listen. Let's go away together.

42:29.720 --> 42:32.951
Just the two of us,
around the world if you'd like.

42:33.040 --> 42:34.712
We'll get over this together.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.233
We'll have adventures.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.799
Oh, Pa.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.560
It would've been fun,
but it's too late for that.

42:43.200 --> 42:44.633
I've decided.

42:45.360 --> 42:47.032
I'm going to marry Jacques.

42:48.240 --> 42:52.995
He's a nice man. I could grow to like him.
Even love him.

42:54.080 --> 42:56.753
And most importantly, he's my sort.

42:58.360 --> 43:00.191
Violette, don't go.

43:01.600 --> 43:06.469
I've made up my mind.
I leave for Paris tonight.

43:09.240 --> 43:10.673
Don't do this.

43:13.520 --> 43:14.873
Goodbye, Pa.

43:31.560 --> 43:36.554
I'm in again. 2,000.
And for the ladies as well.

43:39.120 --> 43:41.350
Darling,
you're too generous.

43:46.320 --> 43:47.469
Happy?

43:49.000 --> 43:51.150
Keep up the good work, Mr Colleano.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.870
Mr Selfridge, what can I do for you?

44:06.960 --> 44:09.520
I wanna play cards. Who's here tonight?

44:10.160 --> 44:12.037
Prince Carol of Romania.

44:13.280 --> 44:14.793
And the two women?

44:14.920 --> 44:17.912
The Dolly Sisters. Musical cabaret stars.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.472
Your Highness, ladies, gentlemen,
may I join you?

44:30.080 --> 44:31.513
Who are you?

44:32.880 --> 44:34.108
I'm Harry Selfridge.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.074
Well, Harry Selfridge,
are you ready to take us on?

44:43.240 --> 44:51.240
