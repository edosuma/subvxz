<i> I guess
I'm not so average anymore.</i>

01:00.960 --> 01:02.960
Now, the reason I've decided

01:02.960 --> 01:05.600
to combine my eighth
and ninth grade classes

01:05.600 --> 01:08.360
is because we're starting
a very special unit

01:08.360 --> 01:11.640
a unit designed to spur your
interest in science.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.080
Now, offhand,
how many of you intend

01:14.080 --> 01:17.000
to go on studying science
after high school

01:17.000 --> 01:19.080
and into college-- hands?

01:19.080 --> 01:21.080
Hands? Hands? Hands? Hands?

01:21.080 --> 01:22.720
Oh, good, good, okay.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.160
Okay, a few of you.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.400
Great, great, because we got
some wonderful things

01:27.400 --> 01:28.960
planned for this week.

01:28.960 --> 01:30.760
We've got slide shows.

01:30.760 --> 01:32.160
We've got film strips.

01:32.160 --> 01:33.880
We've got lecturers coming.

01:33.880 --> 01:36.200
We've got a lot of...

01:36.200 --> 01:39.000
...things that you'll
be interested in.

01:42.360 --> 01:43.600
Hey, huh?

01:45.400 --> 01:47.760
Hope this is science-related.

It's not science though, Ray.

Uh...

02:03.440 --> 02:05.760
Tonight, why don't you write me

02:05.760 --> 02:08.600
a two-page paper on
"why I love science."

02:08.600 --> 02:09.479
Okay?

02:09.479 --> 02:11.160
Can I double-space it?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.400
No, you can't.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.120
Thank you very much.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.960
And all of you owe me

02:15.960 --> 02:18.920
a five-page assignment
in two weeks

02:18.920 --> 02:22.520
on which area of science
interests you the most and why.

02:22.520 --> 02:25.680
That way,
we can decide on which way

02:25.680 --> 02:27.760
this unit will go, all right?

02:27.760 --> 02:29.200

03:01.200 --> 03:02.920
Get up
and get to work.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.720
I was having my dream again.

03:04.720 --> 03:07.880
Good, did you manage to miss
the hydrant this time?

03:07.880 --> 03:09.200
No, this
is different.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.440
Vince, whoever it is

03:10.440 --> 03:13.400
dropped a piece of paper
out of their backpack.

03:13.400 --> 03:14.680
It could be a clue.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.800
Right, I'll decide what is
and isn't a clue, David.

03:17.800 --> 03:20.240
I can't exactly
rely on you now, can I?

03:20.240 --> 03:22.800
Why can't you treat me
with more respect?

03:22.800 --> 03:23.760
I'm trying.

03:23.760 --> 03:24.720
You're trying.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.360
Well, you
wouldn't know it.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.360
I'll treat you
with some respect

03:28.360 --> 03:30.400
when you do
something to earn it.

03:30.400 --> 03:33.520
I'm a human being,
Vince.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.680
So what?

03:38.800 --> 03:40.400
Oh...

03:40.400 --> 03:42.320
Some of the guys
they hire

03:42.320 --> 03:46.280
bring down our team's
whole level of professionalism.

<i>( Whirring )</i>

03:50.720 --> 03:52.160
That's better.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.440
Going to the concert?

03:53.440 --> 03:55.520
Jimmy T. and the Wanderers
are cool.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.920
I heard them
in Ty Robinson's garage.

03:57.920 --> 04:00.080
Why would the Plant
give a concert?

04:00.080 --> 04:02.480
O I don't know, my
Dad said it was a way

04:02.480 --> 04:04.160
of giving
to the community.

04:04.160 --> 04:07.240
Anyway, who knows
with them?

04:07.240 --> 04:08.840
Mr. Mack:
Alex!

04:08.840 --> 04:09.800
Just a minute.

04:09.800 --> 04:11.160
Could you come here?

04:11.160 --> 04:13.040
Ray, there's
no way I'm going.

04:13.040 --> 04:14.200
You realize that.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.360
I just can't take the chance.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.800
What if Scott wanted you to go?

04:18.800 --> 04:20.480
That's not going to happen.

04:20.480 --> 04:21.680
Well, see you, Ray.

04:21.680 --> 04:24.000
You got to start
your science essays.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.920
Aw, man.

<i>( Singing tunelessly )</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:32.440
What's up, Dad?

04:32.440 --> 04:33.800
Oh, guess who called?

04:33.800 --> 04:35.920
Your science teacher,
Mr. Hendricks.

04:35.920 --> 04:37.080
You're kidding me.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.480
Why would he call you?

04:38.480 --> 04:39.960
I haven't
messed up yet.

04:39.960 --> 04:40.960
We just started.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.840
No, no, no,
he's just concerned

04:42.840 --> 04:45.280
about kids losing interest
in his class

04:45.280 --> 04:47.440
and he wants me
to share my passion

04:47.440 --> 04:50.200
about that mysterious world
we call science.

04:50.200 --> 04:51.160
Really? Oh, no.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.520
When are you
coming in?

04:52.520 --> 04:53.640
Tomorrow morning.

04:53.640 --> 04:55.680
What? We have
so much work to do.

04:55.680 --> 04:56.880
Where are we going?

04:56.880 --> 04:58.120
Where do you think?

04:58.120 --> 05:00.800
To see if I can find you
something to wear.

please stop?

<i>( Sighs )</i>

05:31.560 --> 05:33.120
Jorge?

05:34.080 --> 05:35.600
So, whether it be igneous

05:35.600 --> 05:37.400
or whether it be sedimentary

05:37.400 --> 05:40.320
the rocks of the
Paradise Valley Region

05:40.320 --> 05:44.560
provide a fascinating look
into the world of geology.

05:44.560 --> 05:45.760
Any questions?

05:45.760 --> 05:47.080
Uh, yes, Steve.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.680
<i>( Kids laughing )</i>

05:48.680 --> 05:49.720
It's Scott.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.720
You said we could
tell the future

05:51.720 --> 05:53.840
by looking at rocks
we found, how?

05:53.840 --> 05:55.920
That's a good question.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.760
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

05:57.760 --> 06:01.560
Let's have a big hand
for Mr. Mack for coming in, huh?

06:01.560 --> 06:04.320
Thanks, kids, it was
a little bit of heaven.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.680
I'd like to mention

06:05.680 --> 06:08.320
that if any of you
want to join me on one

06:08.320 --> 06:10.120
of my weekend
nature walks

06:10.120 --> 06:11.880
I'd be happy
to... hands?

06:11.880 --> 06:13.520
Anyone?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.840
No takers?

06:15.840 --> 06:17.360
Look at
this locker.

06:17.360 --> 06:19.640
What, you have
a maid come in

06:19.640 --> 06:21.120
and straighten up?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.160
No, Ray.

06:22.160 --> 06:25.040
It's called being organized.

06:25.040 --> 06:27.120
Hey, Nicole,
Robyn, Ray.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.200
What's up, Scott?

06:28.200 --> 06:29.200
Where's Alex?

06:29.200 --> 06:31.520
She just left with her dad.

06:31.520 --> 06:32.480
Why?

06:32.480 --> 06:34.360
Yeah, why?

06:34.360 --> 06:38.120
Nothing, I just wanted
to ask her something.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.120
Really?

06:39.120 --> 06:40.160
Well...

06:40.160 --> 06:42.200
We could
ask her for you.

06:42.200 --> 06:43.680
Oh, no, that's okay.

06:43.680 --> 06:44.720
It could wait.

06:44.720 --> 06:45.960
<i>( Bell ringing )</i>

06:45.960 --> 06:47.600

06:53.520 --> 06:55.680
So, that wasn't
so bad, was it?

06:55.680 --> 06:57.120
It was okay.

06:57.120 --> 07:00.880
You know, in high school,
my nickname was satin steel.

07:00.880 --> 07:03.240
Hey, maybe I could
talk to Hendricks

07:03.240 --> 07:05.560
about making
regular appearances.

07:05.560 --> 07:06.520
Hey, Alex!

07:06.520 --> 07:07.480
Alex.

07:07.480 --> 07:08.440
What's up?

07:08.440 --> 07:10.440
We think Scott's
going to ask you

07:10.440 --> 07:11.840
to the Jimmy T.
concert.

07:11.840 --> 07:13.480
We're not sure,
but he said

07:13.480 --> 07:15.160
he had to ask you
something.

07:15.160 --> 07:16.600
You assumed
that was it?

07:16.600 --> 07:17.960
What else
could it be?

07:17.960 --> 07:19.880
We even heard that next week

07:19.880 --> 07:21.960
Kelly's going out of town.

07:21.960 --> 07:24.040
Well, we're about
to find out.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.960
Okay, tell us
what happened later.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.240
Every detail.

07:30.240 --> 07:31.560
Hi.
Hey, Alex--

07:31.560 --> 07:32.920
Mr. Mack.

07:32.920 --> 07:33.880
Sam!

07:33.880 --> 07:34.840
Uh, Scott.

07:34.840 --> 07:36.560
I was wondering
if I could

07:36.560 --> 07:38.080
join your
nature walks.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.960
I'd love to have you.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.080
How's Saturday?

07:41.080 --> 07:42.800
I'll meet you here,
8:00 A.M.?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.120
I'll bring the gear.

07:44.120 --> 07:45.320
I'll be here.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.720
Um, Scott? My friends said

07:47.720 --> 07:49.960
you were looking for me.

07:49.960 --> 07:52.360
Yeah, but it was nothing.

07:52.360 --> 07:53.360
Forget it.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.280
I'll see you later.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.880
The kid went that way

07:58.880 --> 08:02.880
and the piece of paper
flew out this way.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.960
It's been
over a year.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.400
So, I doubt we'll find anything.

08:07.400 --> 08:11.400
But tomorrow, the PVC-120 vac
detector comes in

08:11.400 --> 08:12.840
and we'll use it here.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.720
If it does pick something up

08:14.720 --> 08:17.840
we could have our first
dyed-in-the-wool clue.

08:17.840 --> 08:19.200
That's what I said

08:19.200 --> 08:20.600
that's what I said

08:20.600 --> 08:22.360
and then you insulted me.

08:22.360 --> 08:25.800
Oh, stop being
so sensitive, David

08:25.800 --> 08:30.240
and just know that I am
very, very proud of you.

08:30.240 --> 08:35.240
And, uh, could you, uh,
grab that safety cone for me?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.960
Later, Dave!

08:39.960 --> 08:41.840

08:41.840 --> 08:42.919
Vince! Vince!

08:44.840 --> 08:47.360
<i>Nicole: He obviously
was going to ask you.</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:48.600
I agree
with Nicole.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.280
I was standing
right there.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.280
I could tell.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.880
You've been talking
for an hour.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.120
He didn't ask her, so forget it.

08:56.120 --> 08:59.320
He's never going to ask me
after a day with my dad.

08:59.320 --> 09:01.240
<i>Do you think I should ask him?</i>

09:01.240 --> 09:05.240
What if he says no-- the
embarrassment could be lethal.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.160
I just hate the idea
of Scott spending all day

09:08.160 --> 09:10.000
tromping around with my dad.

09:10.000 --> 09:13.200
It doesn't seem like a big deal
but it bothers me.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.280
I wouldn't trust
your dad either.

09:15.280 --> 09:16.560
I know he means well

09:16.560 --> 09:19.240
but he could end up
doing a lot of damage.

09:19.240 --> 09:22.520
Yeah, somebody should
keep an eye on them for you.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.920
But if you guys
sign up for the walk

09:24.920 --> 09:26.920
it'll seem
way too convenient.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.640
I can't be there
Saturday.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.920
I know another way
this problem could be addressed.

09:31.920 --> 09:34.560
Robyn and Ray
would have to get involved.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.840
Robyn:
I'm available.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.680
I don't know what
you guys are talking about

09:38.680 --> 09:40.720
but I'm absolutely, positively

09:40.720 --> 09:42.560
not going to be involved.

09:49.160 --> 09:51.080
This is Alex,
how's it going?

09:52.720 --> 09:55.240
We're stationed
on the path.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.800
...great place to hike.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.200
Be careful of snakes.

09:58.200 --> 09:59.800
Ray, do you see anything?

09:59.800 --> 10:01.440
Mayday, mayday!

10:01.440 --> 10:02.880
Hang on, Alex.

10:02.880 --> 10:04.000
Over and out!

10:04.000 --> 10:06.080
Garden hoses can be dangerous.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.200
Reminds me of a story
about Alex.

10:08.200 --> 10:10.360
Alex must have been about ten.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.680
Somehow, she got her toe stuck

10:12.680 --> 10:14.520
in the end
of the garden hose.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.280
Really?
That's pretty funny.

10:16.280 --> 10:17.400
What's happening?

10:17.400 --> 10:19.120
Robyn:
Your dad's relaying

10:19.120 --> 10:21.480
the garden hose incident,
stand by.

10:21.480 --> 10:24.760
We had to call the paramedics
to finally get her out.

10:24.760 --> 10:25.720
<i>( Laughing )</i>

10:25.720 --> 10:26.680
This way.

10:26.680 --> 10:28.080
<i>( Laughing )</i>

10:30.720 --> 10:31.600
Robyn?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.680
Robyn:
...Her toe stuck in...

10:33.680 --> 10:35.560
Robyn, come in.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.760
<i>( Static )</i>

10:48.960 --> 10:50.840
Scott:
I know this sounds dorky

10:50.840 --> 10:53.200
but there's something
about nature

10:53.200 --> 10:54.400
I've always liked.

10:54.400 --> 10:56.720
Especially stars,
I don't know why.

10:56.720 --> 11:00.600
Mr. Mack: You know, there's a
great telescope at the Plant.

11:00.600 --> 11:05.960
It affords a great look
at saturn, rings and all.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.320
That's something to do
my assignment on.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.520
I'm there next week.

11:09.520 --> 11:12.160
If you'd like to come,
you're welcome to.

11:12.160 --> 11:14.840
Next Friday? That's
the night of the concert

11:14.840 --> 11:16.720
we could do it
another time.

11:16.720 --> 11:18.920
No, I have to be
serious about this.

11:18.920 --> 11:20.720
There will be
other concerts.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.640
Next Friday's fine.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.160
Super,
look forward to it.

11:25.160 --> 11:28.160
Hey, Mr. Mack,
what's this plant?

11:28.160 --> 11:30.200
Scott, put that down!

11:30.200 --> 11:31.800
That's poison oak!

11:31.800 --> 11:35.000
Uh, we better
get back right away.

11:40.320 --> 11:41.240
Um...

11:41.240 --> 11:42.160
Ray?

11:43.120 --> 11:44.200
Yeah?

11:44.200 --> 11:45.040
Your hat.

11:45.040 --> 11:45.960
Cool, huh?

11:45.960 --> 11:47.040
Yeah...

11:47.040 --> 11:49.160
But apparently
it's made of poison oak.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.360
What?

11:51.560 --> 11:52.800
<i>( Screaming )</i>

11:59.160 --> 12:02.840
So, you should probably
take a hot bath

12:02.840 --> 12:05.120
and then mix a solution

12:05.120 --> 12:06.720
of epsom salts
and aspirin.

12:06.720 --> 12:07.800
Does it itch now?

12:07.800 --> 12:09.840
No, I think
I'll be okay.

12:09.840 --> 12:13.080
So, does Alex ever do
this sort of stuff with you?

12:13.080 --> 12:15.480
Not very often, no--
actually, never.

12:15.480 --> 12:17.040
Well, I better
get going.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.000
Thanks again.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.560
I'll see you next Friday.

12:19.560 --> 12:20.600
Friday.

12:29.360 --> 12:31.600
<i>( Whimpering )</i>

12:31.600 --> 12:34.400
I take it that means
something's wrong.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.160
Why is this happening to me?

12:36.160 --> 12:37.520
It's not fair.

12:37.520 --> 12:40.760
Love never works out the way
you want it to, Alex.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.200
Get used to it.

12:42.200 --> 12:46.120
That's not true, except I'm not
sure what the problem is.

12:46.120 --> 12:48.560
The problem is that
Scott thinks Dad

12:48.560 --> 12:51.960
is the next coming of
Indiana Jones or something.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.320
I remember that stage--
it won't last.

12:54.320 --> 12:58.280
You know, Alex, that Scott
is a really great kid.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.640
Yes, Dad,
I do realize that.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.400
Everyone thought he was
possibly, maybe probably

13:03.400 --> 13:05.440
going to invite me
to this concert.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.320
Now he'll be
looking at planets.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.240
How did you know he was
going to look at planets?

13:10.240 --> 13:12.840
Well, that's not
really important.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.840
Listen, why don't you just go
with them to the observatory?

13:16.840 --> 13:18.840
Like that won't be
too obvious.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.520
Do me a favor,
don't help.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.160
Dad, can't you
cancel

13:22.160 --> 13:24.200
the planet thing
with Scott?

13:24.200 --> 13:25.800
Then he might ask me.

13:25.800 --> 13:28.160
I don't know how
I can do that, Alex.

13:28.160 --> 13:29.200
Alex...

13:31.000 --> 13:33.280
What do you like
about Scott, anyway?

13:33.280 --> 13:35.200
Isn't he just
your basic jock?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.520
No, he's not your basic jock.

13:37.520 --> 13:40.080
He's just a very nice guy, okay?

13:40.080 --> 13:41.120
That's it?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.320
He's... nice.

13:42.320 --> 13:43.560
Look, Annie...

13:43.560 --> 13:45.240
There's something about him.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.840
He's cute, a star athlete.

13:46.840 --> 13:50.680
He could walk around the school
like he owns it, but he doesn't.

13:50.680 --> 13:52.440
He helped me
my first day at Atron

13:52.440 --> 13:54.880
when Jessica was picking on me.

13:54.880 --> 13:56.400
That was a long time ago.

13:56.400 --> 13:57.360
Is he smart?

13:57.360 --> 13:58.960
I've never heard him say

13:58.960 --> 14:01.240
more than two sentences
at a time.

14:01.240 --> 14:04.160
You don't have to talk a lot
to be smart, Annie.

14:04.160 --> 14:06.280
You could be thinking
smart things.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.920
Alex, I didn't realize

14:07.920 --> 14:10.840
how much this all
meant to you.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.320
I'm not exactly sure
what I did wrong.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.240
<i>( High-pitched humming )</i>

14:21.240 --> 14:25.240
The PVC-120 should pick up
any microscopic remnants

14:25.240 --> 14:29.760
of things that were left here
within the last year or so.

14:29.760 --> 14:32.440
We'll take what
we get to the lab.

14:32.440 --> 14:34.000
Questions?
Comments?

14:34.000 --> 14:35.480
Uh...
After we're done

14:35.480 --> 14:38.440
can I take this baby
over to my apartment?

14:38.440 --> 14:40.680
I'm having company
this weekend.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.920
And you wonder
why I insult you.

14:42.920 --> 14:45.640
Are you mad because
you're not invited?

14:45.640 --> 14:46.960
It's only family.

14:49.000 --> 14:52.600
Of the 1,500 microscraps
of paper you found

14:52.600 --> 14:53.960
we cross-referenced fibers

14:53.960 --> 14:56.200
these were the only ones
that emanated

14:56.200 --> 14:57.720
from school-issued paper.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.120
Because of erosion
and other factors

15:00.120 --> 15:01.280
we were only able

15:01.280 --> 15:03.920
to extrapolate
this much handwriting.

15:03.920 --> 15:06.040
In your opinion,
could we match

15:06.040 --> 15:08.600
that handwriting
if we had a sample?

15:08.600 --> 15:10.760
Like, for instance,
in a guest book.

15:10.760 --> 15:13.240
The kind one might place
at the entrance

15:13.240 --> 15:15.400
of a Junior High School
function.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.240
You take this prototype

15:19.240 --> 15:22.440
and match it against
your guest book

15:22.440 --> 15:24.840
and I like your chances.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.520
Yes!

15:26.520 --> 15:28.080
Do you mind
explaining

15:28.080 --> 15:30.320
what you plan
to use this for?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.240
Yes, I do mind, Kramer.

15:34.240 --> 15:38.560
But, if you must know,
we're doing it for Dave.

15:38.560 --> 15:41.280
We're trying to rectify
a horrible mistake

15:41.280 --> 15:42.800
that he made
last year.

15:42.800 --> 15:45.040
He doesn't like
to talk about it.

15:45.040 --> 15:47.120
Oh, I'm sorry
I brought it up.

15:47.120 --> 15:50.280
That's okay, Vince brings it up
all the time.

15:52.840 --> 15:56.600
Mr. Mack:
Barbara, I'm leaving, honey.

15:56.600 --> 15:58.840
So, I'll be
heading out now.

15:58.840 --> 16:01.560
Sure you don't want
to come, Alex?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.880
Completely
and totally sure.

16:10.520 --> 16:13.040
Hey, how about we head
over to the diner

16:13.040 --> 16:14.760
and we'll get
some dessert?

16:14.760 --> 16:16.960
<i>No thanks, I'm
not that desperate.</i>

16:16.960 --> 16:18.200
Gee, thanks a lot.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.640
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean it like that.

16:20.640 --> 16:22.640
I know, if you
change your mind

16:22.640 --> 16:24.080
I'll be inside, okay?

16:24.080 --> 16:25.080
Okay.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.880
Dave:
Thanks for coming.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.280
Please, sign in.

16:35.280 --> 16:36.240
Oh, shut up!

16:36.240 --> 16:38.000
Hey, kid,
move on!

16:39.600 --> 16:42.480
So, you couldn't convince
Alex to come, either?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.640
Hey, I tried.

16:44.640 --> 16:47.200
She's overreacting
to Scott not asking her.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.440
There's more
to it.

16:48.440 --> 16:51.160
The Plant is not
Alex's favorite place.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.760
She better
get used to it.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.320
She will be
trapped here.

16:54.320 --> 16:56.080
What is that supposed to mean?

16:56.080 --> 16:58.520
You know exactly
what that means.

16:58.520 --> 17:01.800
Everybody in Paradise Valley
ends up working here.

17:01.800 --> 17:03.560
Not Alex,
definitely not me.

17:03.560 --> 17:06.079
Well, not me, too.

17:06.079 --> 17:08.720
Not me, three.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.720
So far we don't have a match

17:16.720 --> 17:20.000
but I think it's going very
well, Vince, very well.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.160
Oh, great, I know my confidence
just skyrocketed.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.920
Vince, will you stop
with the insults?

17:25.920 --> 17:27.480
I have feelings, too.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.440
I mean it.

17:28.440 --> 17:29.800
Right.

17:29.800 --> 17:33.640
Hey, kid, don't forget
to sign the book.

17:33.640 --> 17:35.680
Can you see Saturn?

17:35.680 --> 17:39.600
It's light yellow,
and has the rings.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.760
To be honest...

17:40.760 --> 17:42.360
Not really.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.880
Yeah, I know.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.800
It's pretty
cloudy tonight.

17:49.320 --> 17:51.160
<i>( Music faintly audible )</i>

17:51.160 --> 17:52.160
Hey...

17:52.160 --> 17:54.320
that's a pretty
snappy tune.

17:54.320 --> 17:56.800
That's Jimmy T.
and the Wanderers.

17:56.800 --> 17:59.760
You know that concert
I was telling you about?

17:59.760 --> 18:02.600
Yeah, I've been hearing
about it everywhere.

18:02.600 --> 18:06.040
So, uh, did Alex
go with her friends?

18:06.040 --> 18:08.040
You know,
I don't think so.

18:08.040 --> 18:10.040
Uh, but maybe she did.

18:10.040 --> 18:13.720
Uh, no, I'm pretty sure
she didn't.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.320
She was watching TV
when I left.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.880
So, you still mad
at Dad?

18:18.880 --> 18:19.840
I guess not.

18:19.840 --> 18:21.480
I mean,
it's not his fault.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.760
I shouldn't have made
such a big deal

18:23.760 --> 18:25.640
about Scott
asking me, anyway.

18:25.640 --> 18:29.080
I mean, there was really
no proof that he was going to.

18:29.080 --> 18:31.400
Well, then why
didn't you ask him?

18:31.400 --> 18:33.960
I thought about it
for, like, a second

18:33.960 --> 18:35.680
but then
I chickened out.

18:35.680 --> 18:39.680
Hey, maybe that's
what happened to him.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.880
I doubt it.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.280
You know, Alex,
this is Saturday night.

18:43.280 --> 18:46.520
There's really no reason
for you to be here with me.

18:46.520 --> 18:49.000
How about I drive you
over to the Plant?

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
I'm sure Ray and the girls
would love to see you

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
and, you know, there's
going to be other chances

18:55.000 --> 18:56.880
if Scott wants
to ask you out.

18:56.880 --> 18:59.600
Yeah, you're right,
okay.

19:00.680 --> 19:01.680
It's no use.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.640
I can't see a thing.

19:04.720 --> 19:05.960
I know.

19:05.960 --> 19:07.600
<i>( Sighs )</i>

19:07.600 --> 19:08.840
Sorry.

19:08.840 --> 19:10.320
No, it's not
your fault.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.800
I mean, maybe we should just
call it quits for tonight.

19:13.800 --> 19:14.800
I guess so.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.760
So, Scott,
where are you off to?

19:16.760 --> 19:19.240
Oh, I was probably
just going to go home

19:19.240 --> 19:21.680
and get started
on my paper anyways.

19:21.680 --> 19:23.200
Well, I thought
you might

19:23.200 --> 19:24.840
want to go
to the concert.

19:24.840 --> 19:28.600
Uh, yeah, but I don't really
feel like going alone.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.640
Well, that's
what Alex said.

19:30.640 --> 19:32.680
Well, didn't
her friends go?

19:32.680 --> 19:34.600
Oh, right,
it's confusing.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.560
Well, maybe she's
still at home.

19:36.560 --> 19:37.840
What's your number?

19:37.840 --> 19:39.240
<i>( Rings )</i>

19:39.240 --> 19:42.480
Mr. Mack's voice: You've
reached the Mack residence.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.360
Please, leave a message.

19:44.360 --> 19:45.320
<i>( Beeps )</i>

19:45.320 --> 19:46.880
No, there's no answer.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.000
<i>( Hangs up phone )</i>

19:48.000 --> 19:49.760
But thanks for
all your help.

19:49.760 --> 19:51.040
I'll see you around.

19:51.040 --> 19:52.000
Oh, sure thing.

19:52.000 --> 19:53.480
Uh, you going home?

19:53.480 --> 19:55.480
Yeah.

19:59.760 --> 20:00.640
Scott.

20:00.640 --> 20:01.600
Oh, hey, Alex.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.360
What happened
to the planets?

20:03.360 --> 20:04.640
They're still there.

20:04.640 --> 20:06.480
It was too cloudy
to see them.

20:06.480 --> 20:07.840
I was about
to go home

20:07.840 --> 20:09.560
and get started
on my paper.

20:09.560 --> 20:11.160
What will you
do yours on?

20:11.160 --> 20:12.240
I don't know.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.400
There's so much science
in my family

20:14.400 --> 20:15.760
I've grown to hate it.

20:15.760 --> 20:18.080
I was right
not to ask what I wanted.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.200
Which was?

20:20.200 --> 20:22.760
To go on that nature walk
with me.

20:22.760 --> 20:26.840
But I didn't because I thought
you would think I was boring.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.600
Maybe a little weird,
but not boring.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.600
Are you saying
your dad's weird?

20:31.600 --> 20:33.000
That's what
I'm saying.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
Don't tell me
my dad hasn't said

20:35.000 --> 20:36.680
some strange
things to you.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.840
Yeah, like that
satin steel thing?

20:38.840 --> 20:40.600
He doesn't
look like the type

20:40.600 --> 20:42.640
everyone would
call satin steel.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.600
I know.

20:43.600 --> 20:44.720
Can you believe it?

20:44.720 --> 20:46.720
I think it never
actually happened

20:46.720 --> 20:48.080
but Dad
wished it did

20:48.080 --> 20:49.920
and he said it
so many times

20:49.920 --> 20:51.600
that he believes it now.

20:51.600 --> 20:53.800
Are you going to go
to the concert?

20:53.800 --> 20:56.000
Yeah, I thought
I'd check it out.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.280
You want
to go in with me?

21:02.280 --> 21:03.720
Yeah...

21:03.720 --> 21:06.200
Yeah, I do.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.240
Let's go.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.000
I think we're close--
I feel it.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.200
Oh, great.

21:16.200 --> 21:18.920
El Braino thinks we're
about to hit pay dirt.

21:18.920 --> 21:20.880
Why do you have to be so mean?

21:20.880 --> 21:23.680
Oh, why don't you just relax?

21:23.680 --> 21:25.120
Hey, put that down.

21:25.120 --> 21:26.640
That's the original.

21:26.640 --> 21:28.280
If we don't have that

21:28.280 --> 21:29.920
we can't match the signatures.

21:29.920 --> 21:32.240
I've been wanting to
do something like this

21:32.240 --> 21:35.080
for a long time, Vince.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.120
Oh, ho...

21:36.120 --> 21:38.960
I'll have you tarred...

21:39.640 --> 21:40.680
Feathered...

21:40.680 --> 21:41.920
Fired...

21:41.920 --> 21:43.240
If not worse.

21:43.240 --> 21:45.280
If we don't have
that paper

21:45.280 --> 21:47.120
we can't find the kid.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.680
Come on.

21:50.680 --> 21:55.160
Don't be the bonehead
you so obviously are, Dave.

21:57.520 --> 21:58.960
Give me that paper!

21:58.960 --> 22:01.040
Give me
that paper!

22:01.040 --> 22:03.280
I'll cut you open
and take it out!

22:03.280 --> 22:04.240
<i>( Gasping )</i>

22:04.240 --> 22:05.200
Don't...

22:05.200 --> 22:06.320
Don't swallow it.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.360
If we hate it,
we can leave.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.800
If I can look at planets
with your dad

22:10.800 --> 22:13.360
I think I can listen
to Jimmy T. with you.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.240
Actually...

22:15.240 --> 22:18.720
I'm glad we're here.

22:18.720 --> 22:19.680
Yeah.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.000
Me, too.

22:23.800 --> 22:27.320
<i>Dave ( Faintly ):
How do you like that, Vince?</i>

22:27.320 --> 22:31.440
<i>Vince ( Struggling ):
Give me back the paper, Dave!</i>
