WEBVTT

00:02.383 --> 00:04.383
Did you hear about this study
that found people

00:04.385 --> 00:06.986
that were cool and popular
at 13

00:06.988 --> 00:08.721
have problems succeeding
later in life?

00:08.723 --> 00:11.157
Hmm. I'm doing okay,
and I was very popular at 13.

00:11.159 --> 00:12.291
In school?

00:12.293 --> 00:13.959
Oh, no. At home.

00:14.729 --> 00:15.928
The servants would sing to me,

00:15.930 --> 00:17.830
laugh at my jokes...

00:18.633 --> 00:22.134
I wish I knew their names.

00:22.136 --> 00:25.104
Does the study say what happens
to the unpopular kids?

00:25.106 --> 00:27.573
You tell me-- you woke up
in bed with one.

00:28.709 --> 00:30.543
Listen to this.

00:30.545 --> 00:33.245
I just received an e-mail
from Wil Wheaton.

00:33.247 --> 00:36.248
Leonard Nimoy's son is
working on a documentary

00:36.250 --> 00:38.517
that he started with his
father before he passed away.

00:38.519 --> 00:40.719
It's about Mr. Spock and
his impact on our culture.

00:40.721 --> 00:41.687
Hmm.

00:41.689 --> 00:42.922
Why is he writing to you?

00:42.924 --> 00:44.924
Well, they're looking
for fans to interview,

00:44.926 --> 00:46.692
and Wil thought
I'd be good for it.

00:46.694 --> 00:47.760
Oh. Hey, high five.

00:47.762 --> 00:49.161
Absolutely not.

00:50.798 --> 00:51.764
Yeah, Penny,

00:51.766 --> 00:52.932
you spent some time
in front

00:52.934 --> 00:55.267
of the camera.
Any words of advice?

00:55.269 --> 00:56.569
Yes. Don't take your shirt off

00:56.571 --> 00:58.971
just because the director
said so.

00:58.973 --> 01:01.207
This is a documentary
about Mr. Spock.

01:01.209 --> 01:04.677
I'm sure if there's nudity,
it will be tasteful.

01:38.867 --> 01:40.433
Hey. You got a minute?

01:40.435 --> 01:41.568
Not really.

01:41.570 --> 01:44.904
Visigoths are kind of up my butt
right now.

01:44.906 --> 01:46.840
Pause the game, Howard.

01:46.842 --> 01:48.408
“Howard”? Uh-oh.

01:48.410 --> 01:51.010
Make room, Visigoths.

01:51.546 --> 01:53.213
'Sup?

01:53.215 --> 01:55.455
We need to talk
about redecorating this place.

01:55.456 --> 01:58.385
Oh, no, not this again.
Look,

01:58.386 --> 02:01.387
I get that you grew up here
and you're attached to things

02:01.389 --> 02:02.722
looking
a certain way, but...

02:02.724 --> 02:05.363
I want this to feel
like my house, too.

02:05.364 --> 02:07.995
Oh, honey, of course
it's your house.

02:07.996 --> 02:11.197
Why else would you
be cleaning it all the time?

02:13.368 --> 02:15.268
All right.
Let's start over.

02:15.270 --> 02:16.569
I'm redecorating.

02:16.571 --> 02:18.705
The furniture,
the carpeting, the walls.

02:18.707 --> 02:21.541
I'm changing everything that
depresses me when I look at it.

02:21.543 --> 02:23.610
Try not to be one
of those things.

02:24.479 --> 02:26.179
May I say something?

02:26.181 --> 02:28.214
Is it about how I can't have
new wallpaper

02:28.216 --> 02:30.617
'cause your dad left when you
were little and your mom died?

02:30.619 --> 02:32.385
Never mind.

02:35.090 --> 02:37.390
Hello, Amy. It's Sheldon.

02:37.392 --> 02:39.692
Yeah, I-I know
that we're broken up, but

02:39.694 --> 02:41.995
I'm leaving this message because
I thought perhaps you'd like

02:41.997 --> 02:45.665
to watch me be interviewed for
a documentary about Mr. Spock.

02:45.667 --> 02:49.435
Or as I like to call it,
a Spockumentary.

02:49.437 --> 02:50.803
Yeah, I'm going to use

02:50.805 --> 02:52.906
that joke in the interview,
so try to laugh

02:52.908 --> 02:55.174
like you're hearing it
for the first time.

02:55.176 --> 02:56.976
You know, hysterically, hmm?

02:56.978 --> 03:00.880
And with a tinge of sadness
that I'm no longer in your life.

03:00.882 --> 03:03.449
I'm the one who thought
of “Spockumentary”"

03:03.451 --> 03:05.919
And I'm laughing like I did
the first time I heard it.

03:09.991 --> 03:10.990
Hello.

03:10.992 --> 03:12.058
Hey, Sheldon.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.192
This is Adam Nimoy.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.628
Nice to meet you.
Oh, it's nice to meet you.

03:15.630 --> 03:17.997
I admire your father's work
very much.

03:17.999 --> 03:20.800
It's not every day I get to meet
someone whose life's journey

03:20.802 --> 03:23.303
began in my hero's scrotum.

03:25.574 --> 03:28.508
I told you.
This guy is gold.

03:32.948 --> 03:34.347
Whatcha doing?
Oh!

03:34.349 --> 03:36.983
Making myself a bologna sandwich
like my mom used to make me

03:36.985 --> 03:39.586
after my dad left,
but before she died.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.224
Okay, listen, I'm thinking

03:45.226 --> 03:47.627
that maybe we can compromise
on the house.

03:47.629 --> 03:50.163
I'm listening.

03:50.165 --> 03:53.132
Let's just redo one room
and see how it goes.

03:53.134 --> 03:54.500
That is reasonable.

03:54.502 --> 03:56.402
But what room?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.004
How 'bout this one?

03:58.006 --> 04:02.709
No way. No, this is the room I
associate the most with my mom.

04:02.711 --> 04:04.644
Then how 'bout the bathroom?

04:04.646 --> 04:07.513
I want to change my answer.

04:07.515 --> 04:10.216
Fine. Then the dining room.

04:10.218 --> 04:12.852
I guess we didn't use it
very often.

04:12.854 --> 04:14.220
Unless we had company.

04:14.222 --> 04:16.755
Which didn't happen much
after my dad left and not at all

04:16.757 --> 04:17.470
after my mom...

04:17.494 --> 04:19.173
Great! I'm gonna go
pick out paint samples.

04:21.896 --> 04:24.030
All right, we're just gonna
have a conversation.

04:24.032 --> 04:26.366
Pretend the
camera's not here.

04:26.368 --> 04:28.501
All right.
But this better not be

04:28.503 --> 04:31.104
some elaborate scheme
to get me out of my shirt.

04:33.174 --> 04:34.540
How long have
you known Adam?

04:34.542 --> 04:35.975
A few years.
Mm-hmm.

04:35.977 --> 04:39.112
And what are you
getting him back for?

04:40.015 --> 04:41.748
Let's start with your
name and occupation.

04:41.750 --> 04:45.785
Dr. Sheldon Cooper,
theoretical physicist, Caltech.

04:45.787 --> 04:49.656
And what is your earliest memory
of the character Spock?

04:49.658 --> 04:54.293
The first episode of <i> Star Trek:</i>
<i>The Original Series</i> I ever saw

04:54.295 --> 04:56.295
was “The <i> Galileo</i> Seven.”

04:56.297 --> 04:59.732
Uh, Spock had just landed
on the planet Taurus II.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.268
Then my brother came in,
sat on my head,

05:02.270 --> 05:04.971
and said, “Eat farts.”

05:06.241 --> 05:07.740
After that day, I was hooked.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.442
On <i> Star Trek,</i>

05:09.444 --> 05:12.478
not my brother's
sphincter-based cuisine.

05:14.015 --> 05:16.916
What was it about Spock
that appealed to you?

05:16.918 --> 05:19.986
I think the same thing that
appeals to people everywhere,

05:19.988 --> 05:22.955
the dream
of a cold, rational world

05:22.957 --> 05:25.091
entirely without human emotion.

05:25.093 --> 05:27.060
Spock came

05:27.062 --> 05:29.095
from a planet governed
only by logic.

05:29.097 --> 05:31.364
You know, on Vulcan,
when your brother asks,

05:31.366 --> 05:33.900
“Why are you hitting yourself?”
the answer is,

05:33.902 --> 05:35.268
“I'm not.

05:35.270 --> 05:37.103
You're moving my arm.”

05:38.707 --> 05:39.639
To which he says,

05:39.641 --> 05:41.007
“Fascinating.”

05:41.009 --> 05:44.844
And then you both watch
educational television.

05:44.846 --> 05:46.646
Aw. When he says
things like that,

05:46.648 --> 05:48.815
I just want to hug him
and make everything better.

05:48.817 --> 05:50.850
My brother was
mean to me, too.

05:50.852 --> 05:52.518
Yeah, you probably
had it coming.

05:54.723 --> 05:56.589
Do you have
any Spock collectibles?

05:56.591 --> 05:57.657
I have many.

05:57.659 --> 06:00.093
My most treasured
is an autographed napkin

06:00.095 --> 06:02.829
given to me by my
very thoughtful friend Penny.

06:02.831 --> 06:04.163
That's her over there.

06:06.401 --> 06:08.601
Hi!

06:09.304 --> 06:10.636
Look at that.

06:10.638 --> 06:14.273
I'm in a movie,
my shirt stayed on.

06:14.275 --> 06:16.008
Can we see the napkin?

06:16.010 --> 06:17.477
Of course. Excuse me.

06:17.479 --> 06:18.978
This will just take a moment.

06:20.000 --> 06:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here

06:30.525 --> 06:33.392
When did we get
a wall safe?

06:33.394 --> 06:37.730
When there was no more room
in the floor safe.

06:37.732 --> 06:40.533
When did we get
a floor safe?

06:40.535 --> 06:43.503
When we got the security camera.

06:43.505 --> 06:45.738
There's a
security camera?

06:46.708 --> 06:49.675
Aquaman, protecting your home
since 2012.

06:51.646 --> 06:54.680
Oh, my God.
We've done things on that couch.

06:54.682 --> 06:56.516
Yeah. You don't have to tell me.

06:59.154 --> 07:01.454
So, your father-in-law
is in there right now?

07:01.456 --> 07:02.688
Yes. So back me up.

07:02.690 --> 07:04.991
The house is good the way it is.
Oh, okay. Got it.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.760
Hey. What's going on?

07:07.762 --> 07:09.228
Hey.
Hey, Raj.

07:09.230 --> 07:11.764
Dad and I were just talking
about taking down this wall.

07:11.766 --> 07:16.536
You sure? It's a...
pretty great wall.

07:16.538 --> 07:18.271
What's so great about it?

07:19.307 --> 07:21.340
I'm sorry.
I did what I could.

07:22.710 --> 07:25.545
Seriously? You brought Raj over
to take your side?

07:25.547 --> 07:27.213
Your dad's on your side.

07:27.215 --> 07:29.682
He's not on my side. He's doing
all the work for free.

07:29.684 --> 07:32.585
That is so
generous of you.

07:32.587 --> 07:36.589
I'd like to switch sides.

07:36.591 --> 07:37.857
Look, uh...

07:37.859 --> 07:39.458
I don't even think
you can take this wall down

07:39.460 --> 07:40.660
'cause it's load-bearing.

07:40.662 --> 07:41.928
Well, it's easy to find out.

07:41.930 --> 07:44.130
Just go into the crawlspace
under the house and check.

07:44.132 --> 07:46.866
When is your visa up?

07:49.637 --> 07:52.338
Not only is it signed to me

07:52.340 --> 07:54.173
but this is where he wiped
his mouth.

07:54.175 --> 07:58.644
So we are currently in the
presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.

07:58.646 --> 08:02.114
Um, doesn't Adam count
as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?

08:02.116 --> 08:06.052
No offense, but this is
pure 100% Nimoy.

08:06.054 --> 08:08.855
Because of your mother,
you're only 50%.

08:08.857 --> 08:11.424
Which isn't bad,

08:11.426 --> 08:15.261
but anything that you wipe
your mouth on gets thrown away.

08:16.397 --> 08:17.597
Okay, enough
about the napkin.

08:17.599 --> 08:18.631
What else you
hiding in there?

08:18.633 --> 08:19.899
Wouldn't you like
to know?

08:19.901 --> 08:21.567
I would.
All right then.

08:22.437 --> 08:23.502
See? Just my valuables.

08:23.504 --> 08:27.273
My passport, uh, my will...
You have a will?

08:27.275 --> 08:29.909
Yeah-- my 1/18 scale
Wil Wheaton action figure.

08:31.479 --> 08:33.145
I also have the other kind
of will,

08:33.147 --> 08:37.350
and in it I will my Wil
back to Wil.

08:37.352 --> 08:38.317
Will Wil want it?

08:38.318 --> 08:39.751
Wil won't.

08:40.421 --> 08:42.121
What's that ring box?

08:42.123 --> 08:43.188
Oh. That is

08:43.191 --> 08:44.490
an engagement ring

08:44.492 --> 08:46.692
that I was going to give
my girlfriend Amy.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.494
What?!

08:49.998 --> 08:51.631
You bought her a ring?

08:51.633 --> 08:52.665
No, no, no. This has been
in my family

08:52.667 --> 08:55.668
for generations.
Except for a short time

08:55.670 --> 08:58.137
when Comanches cut off my
great-great-great-grandmother's

08:58.139 --> 09:00.306
finger and stole it.

09:00.722 --> 09:02.555
Sheldon, that's awful.
No.

09:02.557 --> 09:04.757
The Texas Rangers tracked them
down to their village

09:04.759 --> 09:06.426
and slaughtered
every last one of them, so...

09:06.428 --> 09:09.729
it was a happy ending.

09:09.731 --> 09:13.032
Well, for my nine-fingered Nana.

09:13.034 --> 09:15.868
Okay, back to the ring.
Does Amy even know about this?

09:15.870 --> 09:19.072
No. She broke up with me before
I could broach the subject.

09:19.074 --> 09:21.607
Oh, man, I'm sorry--
that must have been devastating for you.

09:21.609 --> 09:23.109
No, not at all.
No, I'm fine.

09:23.111 --> 09:25.378
You know, Amy had reservations
about our relationship,

09:25.380 --> 09:27.046
so all worked out
for the best.

09:27.048 --> 09:30.216
- I know. It just...
- I said I'm fine!

09:34.856 --> 09:37.757
We've gotten a little off-topic.

09:37.759 --> 09:40.093
Allow me to make things
entertaining again

09:40.095 --> 09:42.962
in this little Spockumentary.

09:46.893 --> 09:48.935
That was Leonard's joke.

09:59.114 --> 10:02.182
As a child,
when faced with a dilemma,

10:02.184 --> 10:05.618
my mother encouraged me to ask,
“What would Jesus do?”

10:05.620 --> 10:08.989
The answer to that was always,
“Love thy neighbor.”

10:08.991 --> 10:13.493
But <i> my</i> neighbor had
a dead tooth, so...

10:13.495 --> 10:15.662
that wasn't going to happen.

10:15.664 --> 10:17.497
But...

10:17.499 --> 10:21.634
that's why I changed it
to, “What would Spock do?”

10:21.636 --> 10:23.236
Did you find that helpful?

10:23.238 --> 10:26.039
Yes. Oh, for example,
three years ago

10:26.041 --> 10:28.808
when I discovered Penny
was eating all my Pop-Tarts,

10:28.810 --> 10:31.578
instead of getting angry
or vindictive,

10:31.580 --> 10:34.214
you know, I got a floor safe.

10:34.216 --> 10:37.517
I knew I could smell 'em.

10:37.519 --> 10:39.519
What about
from when you were a kid?

10:39.521 --> 10:42.122
Oh, certainly.
Uh, when I was eight years old,

10:42.124 --> 10:44.391
Billy Sparks cornered me
in the playground.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.826
I asked myself,
“What would Spock do?”

10:46.828 --> 10:49.362
Then I grabbed Billy
on his shoulder

10:49.364 --> 10:52.732
and performed
my first Vulcan nerve pinch.

10:54.136 --> 10:55.368
Did it work?

10:55.370 --> 10:57.670
Oh, no-- he broke my collarbone.

10:58.573 --> 11:02.108
I can still hear it click.

11:02.110 --> 11:03.558
That must have been
very upsetting for you.

11:03.582 --> 11:05.079
Oh, not at all.

11:05.080 --> 11:07.947
As I said, the entire point
of emulating Spock

11:07.949 --> 11:10.350
was to rise above human emotion,

11:10.352 --> 11:12.552
which I've spent
a lifetime mastering.

11:12.554 --> 11:14.087
Oh...

11:14.923 --> 11:16.990
Excuse me?

11:16.992 --> 11:19.125
I'm sorry.
I'm not here.

11:19.127 --> 11:21.594
- No. You went.
- What does mean?

11:21.596 --> 11:22.962
Um...

11:22.964 --> 11:25.098
You did go.

11:25.100 --> 11:27.267
All right, fine.
Well, Sheldon, I'm no expert,

11:27.269 --> 11:29.869
but aren't you completely
missing the point of Spock?

11:29.871 --> 11:31.171
I mean, he liked to act

11:31.173 --> 11:33.473
like he had no emotions,
but he was still half human.

11:33.475 --> 11:34.941
Just like you.

11:36.178 --> 11:37.577
I'm just saying,
you pretend you don't,

11:37.579 --> 11:39.312
but you have feelings
just like everybody else.

11:39.314 --> 11:41.781
Not true. No, look at me.

11:41.783 --> 11:44.050
I had an engagement
ring to give a girl,

11:44.052 --> 11:45.618
and instead,
she rejected me.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.487
And am I emotional
about that? No.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.656
No, I am sitting here
on a couch,

11:49.658 --> 11:51.458
talking about my
favorite TV character

11:51.460 --> 11:52.792
like nothing happened.

11:52.794 --> 11:55.361
'Cause I am just like him:
all logical, all the time.

11:55.363 --> 11:56.429
Sweetie, you're yelling.

11:56.431 --> 11:58.031
Because when I speak
at a regular volume,

11:58.033 --> 11:59.232
no one seems to believe me

11:59.234 --> 12:01.167
that I've put
this Amy nonsense behind me!

12:06.608 --> 12:10.677
This documentary
is gonna be awesome.

12:13.215 --> 12:15.915
You gonna be okay down here?
Yeah. Yeah,

12:15.917 --> 12:17.383
I feel like
an archaeologist.

12:17.385 --> 12:20.854
<i>Indiana Jones and</i>
<i>the Single-Family Dwelling.</i>

12:21.723 --> 12:23.490
Hey. Look!

12:23.492 --> 12:25.391
Found a seashell.

12:25.393 --> 12:28.595
Yeah, that's a rat skull.

12:28.597 --> 12:30.497
Relax.

12:30.499 --> 12:34.067
There's enough droppings down
here without you making more.

12:34.069 --> 12:37.570
Sorry. Do you have a...
sense of where we are?

12:37.572 --> 12:39.506
Yeah. I think that's the den.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.375
Oh. Okay, so we must be
under the dining room.

12:42.377 --> 12:43.776
Uh-huh. Yep.

12:43.778 --> 12:46.546
You know, I know you
don't want to hear this,

12:46.548 --> 12:49.282
but it wouldn't take that
much work to turn that den

12:49.284 --> 12:51.084
into a nursery.

12:51.086 --> 12:53.286
Why wouldn't I want to hear it?

12:53.288 --> 12:55.588
'Cause Bernie said
you didn't want kids.

12:55.590 --> 12:57.357
That's not true at all.

12:57.359 --> 12:58.791
I-I <i> wish</i>

12:58.793 --> 13:00.693
she'd get pregnant, believe me.

13:00.695 --> 13:04.497
I'm climbing on top of her
<i>every</i> chance I get.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.935
In a... loving
and respectful manner.

13:08.937 --> 13:09.969
Oh.

13:11.239 --> 13:12.539
The point is,

13:12.541 --> 13:15.542
I really do want kids.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.076
Huh.

13:17.078 --> 13:19.712
I don't know why
she's lying to you.

13:19.714 --> 13:21.681
She's the one
who doesn't want kids.

13:21.683 --> 13:23.383
In fact, every time I
bring up the subject...

13:23.385 --> 13:25.218
Earthquake!

13:27.289 --> 13:29.589
Oh, my God,
we're gonna die!

13:29.591 --> 13:31.491
Earthquake!

13:32.127 --> 13:35.295
Aftershock...!

13:36.464 --> 13:39.199
I can't believe Sheldon was
gonna ask Amy to marry him.

13:39.201 --> 13:40.700
I know.
I also can't believe

13:40.702 --> 13:42.635
he watched what we did
on that couch

13:42.637 --> 13:44.871
and still sits on it.
Yeah.

13:46.474 --> 13:48.241
Hello.

13:48.243 --> 13:49.576
Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

13:49.578 --> 13:50.610
Better.

13:50.612 --> 13:52.612
Did Wil and Adam leave?
Yeah.

13:52.614 --> 13:54.981
Do you think they're
going to put my outburst

13:54.983 --> 13:56.316
in the documentary?

13:56.318 --> 13:58.418
Definitely.
Oh, yeah.

13:58.420 --> 14:01.921
Well, there's no point
in dwelling on it.

14:01.923 --> 14:03.489
As the Vulcans say,

14:03.491 --> 14:07.460
<i>“Kup-fun-tor</i>
<i>ha'kiv na'ish Du stau.”</i>

14:08.230 --> 14:10.630
Do you know what that means?
No.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.798
Are you telling the truth?

14:11.800 --> 14:13.900
<i>Nirsh.</i>

14:15.203 --> 14:17.604
Well, this is ridiculous.
Being upset about Amy

14:17.606 --> 14:19.339
all the time
isn't accomplishing anything.

14:19.341 --> 14:21.074
If I want to resolve
this situation,

14:21.076 --> 14:22.709
then I need to take action.

14:22.711 --> 14:24.911
What are you gonna do?
I'm going to find her

14:24.913 --> 14:26.045
and ask her to marry me.

14:26.047 --> 14:28.481
And if she says yes,
we can put this behind us

14:28.483 --> 14:30.216
and resume our relationship.

14:30.218 --> 14:31.918
And if she says no...

14:31.920 --> 14:35.355
well, then
she can just <i> ponfo miran.</i>

14:37.892 --> 14:40.059
He didn't meant that.

14:43.665 --> 14:48.001
So I should probably explain
why I kind of fibbed.

14:51.573 --> 14:53.806
That would be nice.

14:53.808 --> 14:56.142
I told my dad that
you were the one

14:56.144 --> 14:59.245
who didn't want kids because I
didn't want to disappoint him.

14:59.247 --> 15:01.881
But you were okay
throwing me under the bus?

15:01.883 --> 15:05.184
Turns out yeah,
I didn't think twice about it.

15:05.186 --> 15:08.655
Bernie, you don't need
to worry about me.

15:08.657 --> 15:11.224
But I don't want
to see you miss out.

15:11.226 --> 15:12.792
Raising children

15:12.794 --> 15:15.795
was the most rewarding
experience of my life.

15:15.797 --> 15:17.463
Oh,<i> please.</i>
Mom did everything.

15:17.465 --> 15:19.699
All you did was
come home from work,

15:19.701 --> 15:21.434
sit on the couch and drink beer.

15:21.436 --> 15:23.369
How is that raising kids?

15:23.371 --> 15:25.071
This is really

15:25.073 --> 15:27.106
a conversation
for husband and wife.

15:27.108 --> 15:30.209
I'm gonna go clean up,
hit the road.

15:30.211 --> 15:33.279
If your mother asks,
I was here till 10:00.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.718
It's interesting your father
didn't help around the house

15:38.720 --> 15:40.720
and Howard doesn't help, either,

15:40.722 --> 15:42.188
so... in a way,

15:42.190 --> 15:44.557
Howard's not only
like your father,

15:44.559 --> 15:49.295
but he's also like the child
that you're afraid to have.

15:50.165 --> 15:52.298
Why are you still here?

15:54.369 --> 15:56.135
Fine, I'll leave.

15:56.137 --> 15:59.272
But it sounds like
<i>somebody</i> needs a fresh diaper.

16:04.346 --> 16:05.712
All right...

16:05.714 --> 16:08.781
I admit...
that I don't help out a lot.

16:08.783 --> 16:11.517
And I need to work on that.

16:11.519 --> 16:12.652
But...

16:12.654 --> 16:14.187
if we had a kid,

16:14.189 --> 16:15.455
it would be different.

16:15.457 --> 16:17.090
Why?
Because...

16:17.092 --> 16:19.425
when my dad left,

16:19.427 --> 16:21.794
I promised myself that...

16:21.796 --> 16:26.232
if I ever had a chance
to be a father...

16:26.234 --> 16:28.634
I'd always be there.

16:30.171 --> 16:32.338
Okay, I'll think about it.

16:32.340 --> 16:34.407
And this an actual
“I'll think about it,”

16:34.409 --> 16:36.442
not like the
“can we get a motorcycle

16:36.444 --> 16:38.978
with a sidecar
I'll think about it”?

16:40.048 --> 16:42.615
It's an actual
“I'll think about it.”

16:42.617 --> 16:46.519
I really believe
I'd be a great dad.

16:46.521 --> 16:48.988
I know you would.

16:48.990 --> 16:50.790
Speaking of...

16:50.792 --> 16:53.259
making babies,
what do you say I wash up

16:53.261 --> 16:55.895
and poke around <i> your</i> crawlspace?

17:31.844 --> 17:33.744
Dr. Dana feels
he isn't that dangerous.

17:33.746 --> 17:36.246
What makes you right and
a trained psychiatrist wrong?

17:36.248 --> 17:38.515
Because she feels. I don't.

17:38.517 --> 17:40.050
All I know is logic.

17:40.052 --> 17:41.752
Yeah, right.

17:42.922 --> 17:44.722
You can just shut
your feelings off.

17:44.724 --> 17:47.091
There goes television,
lying to us again.

17:47.093 --> 17:48.292
We let you

17:48.294 --> 17:49.393
raise our children,

17:49.395 --> 17:51.428
and this is the thanks we get.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.897
Leonard, how could I
have been so foolish

17:53.899 --> 17:56.033
to try and follow
in the footsteps

17:56.035 --> 17:58.902
of a made-up alien race
with no emotions?

17:58.904 --> 18:00.471
Well...

18:00.473 --> 18:02.473
now instead of idolizing
fictional characters,

18:02.475 --> 18:06.443
you can focus on the real people
who are already in your life.

18:08.180 --> 18:10.280
Those are very wise words.

18:10.282 --> 18:11.482
Thank you.

18:11.484 --> 18:12.883
They'd just be
so much more comforting

18:12.885 --> 18:14.585
if they came
out of a television.
