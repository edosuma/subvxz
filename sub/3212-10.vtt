00:17.951 --> 00:19.318
<i>Previously,</i>
<i>on</i> The Last Man on Earth...

00:19.320 --> 00:21.453
If I'm so bad, then why
do you want to live with me?

00:21.455 --> 00:22.454
Because I'm your wife!

00:22.456 --> 00:24.289
I wish I could have a do-over.

00:24.991 --> 00:26.458
Oh, my God!

00:26.460 --> 00:27.559
You're all alone out here?

00:27.561 --> 00:28.727
Yes.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.062
(Gail and Erica scream happily)

00:30.064 --> 00:31.897
Phil?
Wait. You know Phil?

00:31.899 --> 00:32.731
Phil's my husband.

00:32.733 --> 00:34.967
Surprise!

00:36.069 --> 00:37.703
You guys don't understand.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.972
This was gonna be
an awesome joke.

00:39.974 --> 00:42.508
I just can't believe you
didn't tell us there
were other people.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.842
Yeah, that's,
like, the one thing

00:43.844 --> 00:45.544
that's important in this world.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.913
Yeah, and all for what,
just so you can get laid?

00:47.915 --> 00:50.649
No. Because I had
this awesome idea for a prank.

00:50.651 --> 00:52.651
And I had it perfectly lined up.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.553
I mean, I had <i>you</i> guys thinking

00:54.555 --> 00:55.754
that I was
going out camping,

00:55.756 --> 00:57.222
and I had <i>you</i> guys thinking

00:57.224 --> 00:58.490
these guys didn't exist.

00:58.492 --> 01:00.192
That's called the perfect storm.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.928
So, there we are,
about to go skinny-dipping...
You were gonna

01:02.930 --> 01:04.263
go skinny-dipping?!

01:04.265 --> 01:06.331
(scoffs)
As if I would ever do that.

01:06.333 --> 01:08.400
I-I am married to <i>you,</i> Carol.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.369
You told us
Carol was dead.

01:10.371 --> 01:12.004
What?! What?!
Oh, my God!
Phil.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.705
No, a-a different Carol.

01:13.707 --> 01:16.875
Carol, I was, uh, married
to this other woman named Carol

01:16.877 --> 01:18.877
before the virus.
You told me

01:18.879 --> 01:20.012
you were single.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.114
Yeah, I was--
before I got married

01:22.116 --> 01:23.816
to <i>that,</i> uh, Carol.

01:24.617 --> 01:26.285
And, uh, she died in that, uh,

01:26.287 --> 01:28.620
tragic... snowmobiling accident.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.355
(quietly):
Sorry. I miss you.

01:30.357 --> 01:31.924
You're disgusting.

01:31.926 --> 01:33.792
Disgustingly good at pranks!

01:33.794 --> 01:36.562
God, you know, before I go on,
can I just say,

01:36.564 --> 01:38.297
this is really disrespectful
to Carol.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.898
The other Carol.
The late Carol.

01:39.900 --> 01:42.101
Uh, but, you know,
back to this prank.

01:42.103 --> 01:45.204
So, you know, God, it was
gonna be such a great one,

01:45.206 --> 01:47.039
a-and then you guys all
just ruined it.

01:47.041 --> 01:49.108
I feel so bad for you--
you missed out

01:49.110 --> 01:50.375
on this wonderful thing.

01:50.377 --> 01:51.577
I mean, see,
I was gonna...

01:51.579 --> 01:52.711
I was gonna, uh...

01:52.713 --> 01:53.979
(stammering)

01:53.981 --> 01:55.581
...uh, uh...

01:55.583 --> 01:56.748
What...

01:56.750 --> 01:58.083
what was gonna happen was,

01:58.085 --> 02:00.052
when we got out
to those hot springs,

02:00.054 --> 02:03.255
I was gonna say, "Hey, wait...
I need my bathing suit."

02:03.257 --> 02:05.991
Then I was gonna lead you
back to our cul-de-sac,

02:05.993 --> 02:07.292
introduce you
to all these people

02:07.294 --> 02:09.461
who mean the most to me
in the world.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.897
'Cause you do--
have I ever told you guys that?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.398
I wish I told you more.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.833
Yeah.
CAROL: Phil...

02:14.835 --> 02:16.635
Stop talking.

02:16.637 --> 02:17.636
No! No, wait!

02:17.638 --> 02:19.238
Because it feels to me

02:19.240 --> 02:21.573
like you guys still think
this <i>wasn't</i> a prank.

02:21.575 --> 02:22.975
And that's...

02:22.977 --> 02:24.009
that's not acceptable.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.511
That's where I draw the line.

02:25.513 --> 02:27.913
Still think
he's a good guy?

02:27.915 --> 02:29.014
(sighs)

02:29.016 --> 02:30.249
PHIL: Todd,
come on, bud.

02:30.251 --> 02:32.651
There's got to be
some explanation here!

02:32.653 --> 02:34.520
I-I mean,
there <i>is</i> an explanation.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.522
The... you know,
that, uh, prank thing.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.856
MELISSA:
Way to go, Phil.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.124
He actually really liked you.

02:39.126 --> 02:40.926
I don't know why, but he did.

02:40.928 --> 02:43.862
You guys can follow us
to the cul-de-sac--
that's where we live.

02:43.864 --> 02:45.697
Because we exist!

02:46.332 --> 02:47.699
I...

02:53.006 --> 02:54.706
It was a prank.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.141
Carol...

02:56.143 --> 02:57.509
wait...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.678
What, you're just
gonna leave me here?

02:59.680 --> 03:01.413
Wha...?

03:03.116 --> 03:04.550
What...?

03:13.860 --> 03:15.961
♪

03:32.245 --> 03:34.379
♪

03:51.064 --> 03:53.065
(laughter)

03:53.067 --> 03:54.399
This is amazing.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.902
I can't believe
you guys have a cow!

03:56.904 --> 03:58.937
And Gail's a chef,

03:58.939 --> 04:02.074
so this is, like...
Oh, hon, the things
I can make with this.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.042
My mind is
literally spinning.

04:04.044 --> 04:05.210
Crème brûlée,

04:05.212 --> 04:07.379
dulce de leche...

04:07.381 --> 04:09.848
Good morning.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.687
I just came here
to get some, uh... java...

04:15.689 --> 04:17.322
little milk.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.229
These guys give you
the tour? Huh?

04:24.231 --> 04:26.498
Show you around?

04:29.202 --> 04:32.304
I'll take that as a yes or no.

04:36.909 --> 04:39.978
Hey... anybody
seen Carol anywhere?

04:43.082 --> 04:44.416
(sighs)

04:44.418 --> 04:46.952
How long am I gonna be
in the doghouse here?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.820
It was a prank.

04:49.922 --> 04:51.723
Okay. I get it.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.659
You're giving me
the silent treatment.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.227
Very mature.

04:55.229 --> 04:56.828
Well, guess what.
I can silent-treatment

04:56.830 --> 04:58.263
with the best of 'em, huh?

04:58.265 --> 04:59.965
You want to do this?
Let's go.

05:31.531 --> 05:33.999
Boom! Silent treatment!

05:35.201 --> 05:37.436
It was a prank.

05:39.205 --> 05:41.606
(Phil exhales)

05:41.608 --> 05:44.009
PHIL (calls):
Carol?

05:46.212 --> 05:48.613
Carol?

05:50.316 --> 05:51.483
(sighs)

05:51.485 --> 05:53.452
(quietly):
Carol.
What?

05:53.454 --> 05:55.320
Oh, there you are.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.855
Hey, I really need
to talk to you.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.190
Fine.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.991
Let's talk.

05:59.993 --> 06:03.128
(eerie moaning)

06:04.163 --> 06:06.198
(continues eerie moaning)

06:06.200 --> 06:07.632
I'm not quite... understanding

06:07.634 --> 06:09.234
what you're...
what you're doing there.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.002
Isn't that how ghosts talk?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.003
Carol...

06:12.005 --> 06:13.004
Well, I'm dead, right?

06:13.006 --> 06:14.406
Isn't that what you told them?

06:14.408 --> 06:16.575
Can I please explain?

06:16.577 --> 06:18.176
I think it's pretty
cut-and-dry, Phil.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.145
You told me
you were going camping,

06:20.147 --> 06:23.014
and then you went out
skinny-dipping with two hussies.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.683
But I didn't do anything!

06:24.685 --> 06:26.151
Bologna on rye, Phil!

06:26.153 --> 06:28.987
No! Truth meat on honesty bread!

06:28.989 --> 06:33.091
You are nothing but a sewer rat,
you dumb donkey.

06:33.093 --> 06:34.860
Just cattin' around

06:34.862 --> 06:38.063
like the cock of the walk.
Well, guess what, you skunk.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.532
You just sprayed
the wrong dog.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.334
Now, get out.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.403
Carol, this is <i>my</i> house.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.705
Skunks don't live in houses.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.007
And this one's
haunted, anyways.

06:50.009 --> 06:51.643
(sighs)

06:54.781 --> 06:56.415
Get out!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.957
(sighs)

07:18.604 --> 07:19.638
<i>Thanks for letting me</i>
<i>stay here, guys.</i>

07:19.640 --> 07:21.406
It's nice to feel welcome
somewhere.

07:21.408 --> 07:23.608
And don't worry,
I won't be here long.

07:23.610 --> 07:24.910
This is temporary.

07:24.912 --> 07:27.045
They're gonna
come looking for me.

07:27.047 --> 07:28.213
You know, this'll be good.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.081
You know, this is
a nice change of pace.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.950
I could use a break from people.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.785
Yeah, with all their,
"Oh, Phil, do this,

07:33.787 --> 07:36.922
do that, you're a jerk...
(jabbering)."

07:36.924 --> 07:39.558
Oh, no, this is good,
this is nice.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.960
Solitude, loneliness, friends.

07:41.962 --> 07:44.629
And this pool table
makes a fine bed. Yeah.

07:44.631 --> 07:48.433
You know, it's firm, no give--
which is great for the back.

07:48.435 --> 07:49.601
Oh, yeah.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.771
Beds are overrated.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.573
(exhales)

07:54.575 --> 07:56.441
Don't miss beds.

07:56.443 --> 07:57.843
GAIL:
Knock, knock.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.845
ERICA: Carol?
GAIL: Knock, knock.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.980
Didn't you hear us knocking?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.249
Well, we just
wanted to drop by

08:04.251 --> 08:05.750
with this pecan pie

08:05.752 --> 08:08.954
and say we hope
that there's no hard feelings.

08:08.956 --> 08:11.389
Why would there be
any hard feelings?

08:12.291 --> 08:13.959
All you did was make a series

08:13.961 --> 08:15.527
of quick, slut-based decisions

08:15.529 --> 08:18.029
about sharing your body
with a man you hardly knew.

08:18.031 --> 08:21.633
Carol, you know we would
never have done that stuff

08:21.635 --> 08:23.802
if we'd known
Phil was married.

08:23.804 --> 08:25.103
(chuckles):
Of course.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.938
I don't hold it against you.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.540
You had no idea.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.709
And you're not
even from here.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.144
In this country,
we tend to do a bit of research

08:33.146 --> 08:35.614
before inviting a man
into the land down under.

08:35.616 --> 08:39.618
Carol, I can see that
you're hurting really badly,

08:39.620 --> 08:43.054
and I'm hoping that we just...
move past all this.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.322
But in the meantime,

08:44.324 --> 08:46.491
we're just gonna leave
this pie right here.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.660
Oh, I can't eat that pie.

08:48.662 --> 08:51.730
Uh, are you...
are you allergic to pecans?

08:51.732 --> 08:52.731
No.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.000
I just don't enjoy hussy pie.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.968
You understand.

08:56.970 --> 09:00.005
I don't,
but we'll be taking off now.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.040
(quietly):
Yeah.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.142
Okay, Gary, what's your poison?

09:04.144 --> 09:05.977
Tequila sunrise, huh? Okay.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.612
That's a fun choice.

09:09.181 --> 09:10.482
(bottle shatters)

09:10.484 --> 09:11.883
Oh. Let me try that again.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.385
Just grab another bottle,
like so.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.519
Try that.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.687
(bottle shatters)

09:15.689 --> 09:17.789
Cruise makes it look
<i>so</i> easy, you know?

09:21.594 --> 09:23.261
Ow, that hurt.
That really hurt.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.863
(mumbles)

09:24.865 --> 09:27.299
They must have CGI'd
those bottles, right?

09:28.534 --> 09:29.768
(bottle shatters)

09:29.770 --> 09:31.436
Yeah, I'm gonna have
all these tricks down

09:31.438 --> 09:33.038
by the time
they come looking for me.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.739
It's gonna be
a fun surprise for them.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.541
Okay, here we go. Okay.

09:36.543 --> 09:37.609
Whoa!

09:37.611 --> 09:39.110
(high-pitched):
I got it!

09:41.747 --> 09:43.248
Hey, Carol.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.250
Can we come in?
Oh, absolutely.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.085
Come in.
Have a seat, you.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.553
Hey, I brought you
some tea.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.522
Careful, it's
really hot, okay?

09:50.524 --> 09:52.624
MELISSA:
So, we heard

09:52.626 --> 09:54.926
you talked with...
Gail and Erica.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.461
We just wanted
to come over,

09:56.463 --> 09:59.464
and see if you're doing okay.

09:59.466 --> 10:00.432
I'm fine.

10:00.434 --> 10:01.700
Why wouldn't I be?

10:01.702 --> 10:03.835
Everything's fine.
Carol, that's...

10:04.770 --> 10:07.205
Sorry, I tried
to warn you...

10:07.207 --> 10:08.406
about...

10:08.408 --> 10:09.941
(shuddering groan)

10:09.943 --> 10:11.710
That's all right, Todd.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.378
It's okay.

10:13.380 --> 10:14.579
Everything's fine.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.014
(whispers):
So...

10:20.953 --> 10:22.253
Okay...

10:22.255 --> 10:24.356
I see what you're doing
over there.

10:25.257 --> 10:26.891
What-what are we doing?
Mm.

10:26.893 --> 10:29.427
Sitting so far apart
from each other.

10:29.429 --> 10:30.629
Oh, we're not... No.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.430
I'm a strong woman, okay?

10:32.432 --> 10:35.967
I can handle seeing two people
being affectionate.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.435
Ah.
Please,

10:37.437 --> 10:38.670
kiss each other.

10:38.672 --> 10:40.438
(chuckles):
For me. I can take it.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.073
We're just kind of
hanging out right now,

10:42.075 --> 10:43.842
you know what I mean?
Carol, this is
uncomfortable.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.443
You know what's comfortable

10:45.445 --> 10:47.846
is this pity party
you're throwing me.

10:47.848 --> 10:49.314
Okay?

10:49.316 --> 10:51.416
Go ahead, kiss. Come on.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.319
Kiss. For me, please.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.255
Oh, come on,
you can do better than that.

10:57.257 --> 10:58.256
Get into it!

10:58.258 --> 10:59.791
Come on, kiss like
you used to!

10:59.793 --> 11:01.459
(moaning loudly)

11:01.461 --> 11:03.428
Oh, that was so fake!

11:03.430 --> 11:05.130
Kiss! Come on!

11:05.132 --> 11:06.498
(both moaning)

11:06.500 --> 11:07.499
Okay, that's enough, Todd.

11:07.501 --> 11:08.933
Yes, copy that.
This is...

11:08.935 --> 11:10.602
I just... whoo!
This is weird.

11:10.604 --> 11:13.138
Very.
Carol, what is going
on with you?

11:13.140 --> 11:14.539
It's called
being just fine, Melissa.

11:14.541 --> 11:15.974
Maybe you should
try it some time.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.108
Carol...
Now, if you don't mind,

11:17.110 --> 11:19.310
I'd like to be alone.
Thank you.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.746
Yeah, okay.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.516
MELISSA: Okay, well,
just let us know

11:24.518 --> 11:25.884
if you need anything.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.989
They're not coming.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.292
Oh, they don't care where I am

11:34.294 --> 11:37.128
'cause they don't like me.

11:37.130 --> 11:40.865
Which is really sad
'cause I want to go back!

11:40.867 --> 11:44.135
I don't want to live
at this stupid bar...

11:44.137 --> 11:47.539
a pool table for a bed.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.375
(sighs)
I was wrong.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.645
Beds are underrated.

11:53.647 --> 11:56.715
And people are underrated. God.

11:56.717 --> 11:58.216
Oh, but they don't like me.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.852
They're not gonna talk to me.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.487
(sighs)

12:02.489 --> 12:04.489
Oh, I get it, I blew it.

12:04.491 --> 12:07.025
I really beefed it.

12:07.027 --> 12:08.827
I asked for a do-over

12:08.829 --> 12:11.529
and instead I got a do-do-over.

12:11.531 --> 12:14.399
Boom, I still got it.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.602
(sighs)
I'm persona non grata.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.771
Iced out.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.907
No one wants to have
anything to do

12:22.909 --> 12:25.877
with old Phil Miller.

12:25.879 --> 12:30.181
But I mean, I am who I am.

12:30.183 --> 12:34.919
I can't just magically change
into another person.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.921
(mutters softly)

12:38.424 --> 12:40.525
(knocking)

12:43.629 --> 12:46.030
PHIL (deep-voiced):
Hi.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.465
The name's Mike Miller.

12:47.467 --> 12:49.300
I'm looking for my
twin brother, Phil.

12:49.302 --> 12:50.568
Oh, my God, people!

12:50.570 --> 12:53.238
It's been so long.
(stammering) Oh, God!

12:53.240 --> 12:55.373
Damn it.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.142
How did that not work?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.380
MELISSA:
That's looking good.

13:02.382 --> 13:03.548
TODD: Ooh! Yeah!
Oh, wow.
(others exclaiming)

13:03.550 --> 13:05.116
Hey.
Good shot.

13:05.118 --> 13:08.052
I just can't believe
he put on a costume.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.421
(scoffs)
That's what you
can't believe?

13:10.423 --> 13:11.756
I can't believe
he thought we would believe

13:11.758 --> 13:13.124
he was his own brother.
TODD: Right?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.893
What did Carol say?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.428
Oh, she just slammed the door
right in his face.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.730
Good for her,
poor thing.

13:18.732 --> 13:20.932
I mean, that man is a little
tossed in the head.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.934
MELISSA: Yeah, a little.
GAIL: Yeah.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.636
MELISSA:
He's also a pathological liar.

13:24.638 --> 13:26.337
ERICA:
Oh, what a wanker.

13:26.339 --> 13:28.740
We really dodged a bullet
with that guy.

13:28.742 --> 13:31.810
GAIL: Oh, good-bye and good
riddance, Phil Cormaneau.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.611
MELISSA:
Cormaneau?

13:33.613 --> 13:34.779
TODD:
His last name's Miller.

13:34.781 --> 13:37.982
ERICA: He lied about
that, too? Why?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.784
MELISSA: Why not?
GAIL: What a liar.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.319
I can't believe he just lied.
TODD: What a liar.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.687
MELISSA:
Take it easy.

13:42.689 --> 13:44.989
TODD: Okay, I'm just
so disappointed...

13:44.991 --> 13:49.027
PHIL:
I do not feel great right now.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.596
They don't miss me at all.

13:51.598 --> 13:53.464
Why are they so mad?

13:53.466 --> 13:56.301
Why won't they give me
the benefit of the doubt?

13:56.303 --> 13:58.636
They think I'm just some liar.

13:58.638 --> 14:00.772
I am not a liar.

14:00.774 --> 14:04.042
I mean, what have I ever done
that would make them think that?

14:06.645 --> 14:08.446
It was a prank.
I found the cow!

14:08.448 --> 14:09.480
I got the rings.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.316
I'm a pretty major tennis guy.

14:11.318 --> 14:13.318
Are you attracted to Melissa?
No.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.853
Are you lactose intolerant?
Yes.

14:14.855 --> 14:16.821
I can fix a friggin' door.
Committed to this marriage.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.122
I've been very busy, Carol.

14:18.124 --> 14:19.657
You're all alone out here?
Yes.

14:19.659 --> 14:20.625
Must've been a raccoon.

14:20.627 --> 14:21.726
I used to have a VW Bug.

14:21.728 --> 14:23.127
I have diarrhea.
Big Shankhead here.

14:23.129 --> 14:24.529
Cormaneau.
I'm a nice person.

14:24.531 --> 14:26.231
The name's Mike Miller.
Balls are clean.

14:26.233 --> 14:27.465
(gasps)

14:27.467 --> 14:29.367
I am a liar.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.469
(laughing)

14:33.372 --> 14:34.906
(Todd sighs)

14:34.908 --> 14:35.974
Oh, look who it is,

14:35.976 --> 14:37.175
everybody.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.309
Mike Miller.

14:38.311 --> 14:40.011
Or is it Mike Cormaneau?

14:40.013 --> 14:41.346
(sighs)

14:41.348 --> 14:42.580
Can I talk to you guys?

14:42.582 --> 14:43.681
No.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.683
I'm not leaving
until I say my piece.

14:45.685 --> 14:47.819
Fine, stay here.
We'll just ignore you.

14:47.821 --> 14:49.354
You know what,
anybody want a refill?

14:49.356 --> 14:50.722
I do.

14:50.724 --> 14:52.190
TODD: Great.
Thank you very much.

14:52.192 --> 14:53.524
Yeah, don't mind me.
TODD:
You're welcome.

14:53.526 --> 14:54.859
I'll just be here, uh,
doing this.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.528
(high-pitched yell)

14:57.530 --> 15:01.766
(continues yelling)

15:01.768 --> 15:03.768
I'll just keep screaming
until you talk to me.

15:03.770 --> 15:06.537
(high-pitched yell)

15:06.539 --> 15:07.939
(continues yelling)

15:07.941 --> 15:09.707
MELISSA:
Phil.

15:09.709 --> 15:11.175
Can't you get it through
your little perm?

15:11.177 --> 15:12.543
We don't want to talk to you.

15:12.545 --> 15:17.248
No, Melissa, let's just over
with which to get this.

15:19.184 --> 15:21.452
Are you guys ready
for a bombshell?

15:22.922 --> 15:26.024
When I was gonna go skinny-
dipping with Gail and Erica...

15:26.026 --> 15:27.926
that wasn't a prank.

15:29.561 --> 15:32.463
That was a very real effort
to swim naked with women.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.668
Moving on. Melissa.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.971
I did not want to have sex
with you

15:39.973 --> 15:42.307
solely for the purpose
of repopulation.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.043
I wanted to have sex with you

15:45.045 --> 15:46.978
because you're
a friggin' smoke show.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.449
Todd...

15:51.451 --> 15:53.751
I did not cowrite
"Fields of Gold."

15:53.753 --> 15:56.955
The only person who wrote
that song was Sting.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.992
And finally, Carol.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.563
I can't even begin
to count the ways

16:05.565 --> 16:07.799
that I've been dishonest
with you.

16:07.801 --> 16:10.101
But let me start with this:

16:10.103 --> 16:12.670
We should have never
gotten married.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.808
When I said "I do,"

16:16.810 --> 16:18.242
it was a lie,

16:18.244 --> 16:20.011
'cause I didn't.

16:23.282 --> 16:25.350
And I know I've hurt you...

16:25.352 --> 16:27.819
and I'm really, really sorry.

16:30.022 --> 16:32.523
Look, I don't expect this
to change the way

16:32.525 --> 16:34.959
that any of you guys
feel about me,

16:34.961 --> 16:38.663
but I'd rather be an honest
person with no friends

16:38.665 --> 16:42.200
than live one more day
as a liar, so...

16:43.836 --> 16:45.870
Smell ya never.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.708
Excuse me.

16:53.212 --> 16:55.680
(sighs)

16:58.017 --> 17:01.219
I knew he didn't write
"Fields of Gold."

17:13.032 --> 17:15.566
(sighs)

17:19.505 --> 17:21.139
PHIL:
<i>So I, you know,</i>

17:21.141 --> 17:23.908
I said my piece and, uh...

17:23.910 --> 17:26.577
did not get a lot
of traction there,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.212
but, uh, I feel good.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.015
I-I feel...
I did the right thing.

17:31.017 --> 17:32.984
I mean,
it's-it's what I had to do.

17:32.986 --> 17:35.286
Um...
CAROL:
Phil?

17:36.855 --> 17:40.191
Phil, are you talking to balls
with faces drawn on them?

17:40.193 --> 17:43.194
Y-Yes.

17:43.196 --> 17:44.595
I am.

17:44.597 --> 17:46.731
Okay.

17:46.733 --> 17:50.401
Well, I guess
they can hear this, too.

17:50.403 --> 17:52.537
I have a few things to say.

17:52.539 --> 17:55.239
If you have any questions,
comments or applause,

17:55.241 --> 17:56.774
just save it until I'm done.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.343
I don't think applause
will apply,

17:59.345 --> 18:01.846
but just hold it till the end.

18:01.848 --> 18:04.615
Okay.
Phil, what did I just ask?

18:04.617 --> 18:06.284
Sorry.
Phil!

18:15.627 --> 18:18.329
Phil, what do you think
about this quilt?

18:22.734 --> 18:24.469
'Cause you know what I think?

18:24.471 --> 18:27.138
I think it's U-G-L-Y,

18:27.140 --> 18:29.273
this quilt ain't got no alibi.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.541
It's ugly.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.876
(stomps feet rhythmically)

18:31.878 --> 18:33.611
It's ugly.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.480
Do you see where I'm going
with this?

18:37.082 --> 18:38.616
You can talk.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.752
Respectfully, I-I have no clue.

18:41.754 --> 18:45.256
Phil, sometimes, in quilting,

18:45.258 --> 18:48.126
you just don't have
the right scraps.

18:48.128 --> 18:51.662
And no matter how much effort
you put in,

18:51.664 --> 18:53.965
you make a quilt
that looks like this.

18:53.967 --> 18:56.400
I will agree that it's ugly.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.402
And you worked so hard on it

18:58.404 --> 19:01.239
and you trick yourself
into thinking it's beautiful

19:01.241 --> 19:05.510
and you display it proudly
in the entryway on your divan.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.580
And then your friend Barbara
comes over a few days later,

19:09.582 --> 19:11.682
and she tells you that
she thinks it's best

19:11.684 --> 19:14.285
if you fold it up
and put it in the closet.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.454
You see what I'm saying now?

19:16.456 --> 19:21.492
Barbara's a pretty mean person
and tells it like it is and...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.394
Right? Yes?

19:24.663 --> 19:27.698
I think it's time we put
this quilt in the closet.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.872
So, here.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.180
Divorce papers?

19:42.182 --> 19:44.615
They're official. I'm a notary.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.684
Are you sure about this?

19:46.686 --> 19:48.553
Yeah, Phil.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.621
You're better off without me.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.623
I'm better off without you.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.160
I just want you to be happy.

19:56.162 --> 20:00.631
Well, I just want you
to be happy.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.233
Then sign.

20:07.306 --> 20:09.540
There.

20:09.542 --> 20:10.808
And there.

20:10.810 --> 20:13.644
Uh-huh.

20:13.646 --> 20:15.680
And... ooh, Social
Security, right there.

20:15.682 --> 20:17.682
This is fun to
notarize again.

20:17.684 --> 20:21.419
(laughs): Oh, man, once
you break the seal...

20:21.421 --> 20:23.221
It's a notary joke.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.755
I wish Glen were here.

20:24.757 --> 20:26.424
He would've gotten a
kick out of that one.

20:29.027 --> 20:31.329
It's official.

20:31.331 --> 20:34.498
It's official.

20:34.500 --> 20:35.933
Friends?

20:36.868 --> 20:39.070
Friends.

20:39.072 --> 20:41.973
Ah, get in here.

21:03.028 --> 21:05.696
Well, see you back
at the cul-de-sac.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.632
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.707
So, that's my ex-wife.
