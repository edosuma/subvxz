01:35.520 --> 01:39.002
BASED UPON TRUE EVENTS

01:55.440 --> 01:57.700
What was wrong with the old place?

01:57.735 --> 02:00.668
- Where do I start?
- I liked it.

02:00.703 --> 02:04.596
- You can stay there.
- Very funny.

02:12.000 --> 02:16.058
- Can we put some music on, please?
- Or we can just have me.

02:23.440 --> 02:26.444
- How much do we pay the movers?
- 20 pounds.

02:26.880 --> 02:28.803
Cheeky sons.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.361
- When are Brian and Rita showing up?
- When it's too late to help.

02:34.720 --> 02:37.743
- Typical Brian.
- Typical Rita.

02:51.880 --> 02:55.315
- I hate it.
- You don't know how good your life is.

02:56.720 --> 02:59.464
- What's that spastic doing here?
- Who?

02:59.499 --> 03:02.209
There, from school.
She smells like piss.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.648
Pretend you're in an old people's home.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.326
- Cavalry has arrived!
- And the trouble.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.085
Don't panic, Len.

03:51.120 --> 03:54.254
- I've got a job for you.
- Bugger, I thought we missed all that.

03:54.480 --> 03:56.369
- A housewarming present.
- I had a day off.

03:56.600 --> 03:59.790
No rest for the wicked.
The first three are yours.

04:04.240 --> 04:06.696
- First three?
- Yeah.

04:39.440 --> 04:41.993
The bath is that way, love.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.700
Come on, look like you are happy.

04:45.735 --> 04:48.190
- You get that thing in the bedroom?
- Cheeky dog.

04:48.225 --> 04:50.646
Hey, that's why I've got a darkroom.

04:52.200 --> 04:54.362
You can come down anytime.

04:55.080 --> 04:58.985
Catlefield Woods.
I've been in there.

04:59.020 --> 05:01.525
- So?
- It's right mysterious.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.967
Turn around.
Come on!

05:04.880 --> 05:06.770
What's with that long face?

05:06.771 --> 05:08.503
I can cheer up, but you'll
always be awkward.

05:09.523 --> 05:13.823
- Did you hear that?
- Come in. The camera is blocked.

05:13.920 --> 05:17.025
Come on, girls.
Show me.

05:17.800 --> 05:20.565
Beautiful. Beautiful, girls!

05:20.760 --> 05:23.457
That's how we do it, you see?

05:23.492 --> 05:25.407
You two share.

05:25.600 --> 05:29.127
- To the new house!
- To the new house! Cheers!

05:29.320 --> 05:31.185
Cheers.

05:31.640 --> 05:34.365
The bubbles got up my nose.

05:37.080 --> 05:40.641
Show us some love.
Beautiful.

05:40.676 --> 05:42.404
What's up, love?

05:42.439 --> 05:45.523
- I thought you were happy.
- I'm more than happy, Len.

05:47.440 --> 05:50.645
- That's just sick, isn't it?
- I think it's nice.

05:50.680 --> 05:53.445
- Shouldn't you be getting home?
- Relax, not so fast.

05:54.240 --> 05:59.408
- I should've been a model.
- Lovely. Once again. Watch the birdie.

06:43.880 --> 06:46.083
- Dad?
- Yes, love?

06:46.400 --> 06:49.309
Did you just move my stuff?

06:49.800 --> 06:52.103
You're kidding, aren't you?

06:52.680 --> 06:55.251
Put it back before your mum sees it.

08:14.720 --> 08:17.485
- Avocado?
- What?

08:17.520 --> 08:20.251
Avocado. That would
be nice, wouldn't it?

08:21.200 --> 08:22.925
Don't you mean green, love?

08:22.960 --> 08:26.219
- You don't have a sense of style, Len.
- Or more pertinently, money.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.005
- Come on, cheer up, love.
- You alright?

08:32.039 --> 08:35.885
I don't like this house.
It gives me the creeps.

08:35.921 --> 08:37.965
The light moved on its own last night.

08:38.000 --> 08:40.446
- Did you leave a window open?
- Buckaroo went off.

08:40.481 --> 08:44.215
- He's supposed to do it, isn't it?
- By itself?

08:48.280 --> 08:51.090
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Time for school.

09:02.800 --> 09:06.600
Subsequently led to the demise
of the Catholic Church in England.

09:06.635 --> 09:09.490
The monasteries were
closed by which king?

09:09.560 --> 09:10.971
Mr Price?

09:11.320 --> 09:13.853
Sir.

09:18.360 --> 09:20.509
Sir?

09:20.680 --> 09:22.845
She's drawn a picture of you, sir.

09:22.880 --> 09:25.285
She fancies you, sir.
Look, she's gone red.

09:25.320 --> 09:28.767
Right, girls. That's enough.
Bring out, Sally. Come on, let's see it.

09:38.720 --> 09:42.033
It's really good.
I would say it's excellent.

09:42.876 --> 09:44.925
If this was an art class.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.611
And you got my hair wrong.
Detention.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.771
Right, can someone tell me
who closed all the monasteries?

09:54.598 --> 10:00.360
- Henry VIII, sir.
- How many wives did he have?

10:36.800 --> 10:39.451
- I'm not staying here on my own.
- We won't be out long.

10:39.486 --> 10:42.171
- There's 10 shilling on the shelf.
- There's somebody here.

10:42.520 --> 10:46.320
Stop it, love. You're a big girl now.
Behave like one.

10:46.760 --> 10:49.240
If I'm a big girl, why can't I come?

10:49.275 --> 10:50.480
Because you're too young.

10:50.515 --> 10:52.976
- I can't win, can I?
- No.

10:53.760 --> 10:56.689
- Bye, love.
- See you.

10:58.640 --> 11:01.401
Sod off then.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.809
It's your round, isn't it?

11:18.800 --> 11:23.010
Here you go. With a coaster.
We're civilized, right?

11:28.480 --> 11:32.659
0 So? Settling in all right?
- Kind of.

11:32.840 --> 11:35.942
Sally got in her mind that we're not alone.

11:36.403 --> 11:37.603
What do you mean?

11:37.657 --> 11:40.409
We've got a ghost there.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.122
She is just a child.

11:47.720 --> 11:53.219
- I thought I saw something myself.
- Don't tell her that, it'll be the end.

11:53.998 --> 11:57.822
Ladies. Is it okay?

11:59.840 --> 12:03.164
Cheers, love.
You bless.

12:26.000 --> 12:30.725
That was 'Limmie And The Family
Cooking' with 'The Walking Miracle'.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.004
I hope our charts is to your liking.
Jimmy Osmond went up ten places.

12:35.039 --> 12:39.767
Sunny with her 'Doctors Orders'
went up nine places.

13:32.480 --> 13:34.956
That's our Sally.

13:35.520 --> 13:40.893
- She is soaked through, the poor thing.
- What are you doing out here?

13:42.480 --> 13:44.567
Come, love.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.289
Mum, I saw it.

13:48.520 --> 13:52.286
A child's toy coming down the stairs
doesn't mean we've got a ghost.

13:53.120 --> 13:57.205
It's late. We're all tired.
Bed.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.556
I believe you.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.504
- She went mad.
- Did she?

14:17.539 --> 14:20.028
She'll ask for you next time.

14:21.880 --> 14:25.265
- Another bloody power cut?
- Would be nice to get some notice.

14:28.160 --> 14:31.018
Next-door still got their lights on.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.321
- You've got candles?
- I don't know where they are.

15:24.840 --> 15:29.892
- Jesus, what was that?
- I'll give you one guess. Right, ma'am.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.555
What do you all think you're doing?

15:37.160 --> 15:38.844
You little sod!

15:38.920 --> 15:41.465
- That was the ghost!
- My ass it is!

15:48.480 --> 15:53.069
- I'm not staying in here.
- I'm gonna see if she's okay.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.930
Get the torch.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.645
Rita! Behind you!

16:18.560 --> 16:20.908
What's going on?

16:22.600 --> 16:25.549
Some welcome in here...
What's happening?

16:26.160 --> 16:29.164
Look, it wouldn't be the first time
she would play tricks, would it?

16:29.199 --> 16:30.571
- This was different.
- How?

16:30.606 --> 16:32.005
It just was.

16:32.280 --> 16:35.363
What about the lights?
- Switched off with the mains.

16:35.398 --> 16:39.251
- The noises?
- Just a kids recording, that's all.

16:39.286 --> 16:41.607
- The tap?
- It needs a new washer, love.

16:41.642 --> 16:44.126
- And the grandfather clock?
- Did it fall?

16:44.161 --> 16:47.539
- Or was it pushed?
- Hard to tell.

16:47.795 --> 16:51.128
Look, it's obvious.
She doesn't want to be here, right?

16:51.163 --> 16:54.010
It's just a form of protest.

17:08.040 --> 17:12.568
- You don't believe me, do you?
- No, not at all.

17:13.040 --> 17:15.824
- Where is mum?
- She is tired, she's still in bed.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.080
- I'll take her tea up.
- I don't want her upset, love.

17:18.116 --> 17:20.156
You don't mind if I am?

17:44.840 --> 17:48.322
- What are you doing? Get off!
- It's all sticky.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.548
- What is it?
- Nothing, sir.

18:08.583 --> 18:10.554
Get on with it, then.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.803
Look what I've found in the library.

18:23.800 --> 18:29.170
It says old spirits chill down rooms,
throw stuff and turn lights off.

18:29.205 --> 18:31.441
- You know what I think?
- What?

18:31.560 --> 18:36.239
- There's a rational explanation for this.
- Yes, you've got a ghost.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.405
I think Len had a point.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.785
- Blame it on the kid?
- We had a few drinks.

18:41.820 --> 18:45.131
You don't get that from a few
baby-champs and a woman-pep.

18:45.200 --> 18:48.647
I'm sure it's not just wishful thinking.
You believe in all that stuff.

18:48.682 --> 18:50.925
I felt it, you felt it, she felt it.

18:50.960 --> 18:53.565
It wasn't wishful thinking,
or a kid playing tricks.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.206
- You don't know what she's like.
- But I know what I saw.

18:56.241 --> 18:59.841
Maybe if you had a kid on your own,
you would understand.

19:03.400 --> 19:06.688
I'm sorry, love. I didn't mean to say that.
- It's alright.

19:13.160 --> 19:17.544
- I just want everything to be nice.
- I know.

20:14.540 --> 20:17.049
Watch it, stupid sod!

20:18.480 --> 20:20.881
You're just like all the rest, are you?

20:20.960 --> 20:24.123
- Don't go.
- You've hurt me today.

20:25.240 --> 20:27.463
I'm sorry.

20:34.960 --> 20:38.567
- Do you really fancy Mr Price?
- Not your business.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.085
- Yes.
- He's quite nice, isn't he?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.944
- He's like John Denver.
- He's not like John Denver.

20:45.303 --> 20:48.886
- 'You fill up my senses. Like a night in...'
- Stop it.

20:49.040 --> 20:51.857
- I like him too.
- Hands off.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.531
- I best go in.
- Not yet.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.566
Alright. Would you like
to blow up a Cindy doll?

21:26.800 --> 21:29.714
You bugger, is that my coat?

21:39.400 --> 21:41.767
Wait until I get my hands on you.

21:44.480 --> 21:46.608
I hope that's not you, Sally.

22:13.720 --> 22:17.960
Open up!
Sally, open the door!

22:18.320 --> 22:21.725
There's something in here.
Go away!

22:22.760 --> 22:25.846
Sally, I'm warning you.
Bloody open this door!

22:29.680 --> 22:34.268
- Dad, what's up?
- You shit!

22:37.760 --> 22:41.697
I'm sorry, darling.

22:47.360 --> 22:50.011
- What are you gonna do now?
- Leave.

22:50.880 --> 22:53.165
- Oh, are you?
- What else we're gonna do?

22:53.200 --> 22:55.685
Where to? It was hard enough
finding this place.

22:55.720 --> 22:59.599
- You are on the bottom of the waiting list.
- But if we tell them about the ghost...

22:59.603 --> 23:02.405
- They won't believe us.
- What about father Clifton?

23:02.440 --> 23:05.523
It's been years since we go to the church.
He'll slam the door in my face.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.445
You're always welcome at mine.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.767
I'm not being driven out.
And that's final.

23:49.880 --> 23:52.641
Who are you?

24:02.440 --> 24:05.444
A friend...

24:05.920 --> 24:08.592
Well, you can bugger-off.

24:40.200 --> 24:42.681
What do you want?

25:32.400 --> 25:37.241
Avocado? She doesn't mean green?

25:38.040 --> 25:40.845
If you can't afford it,
you can't afford it.

25:40.880 --> 25:43.850
That's the kind of logic
if she wants something.

25:47.960 --> 25:52.109
- I hear you've got a spook?
- What about it?

25:52.560 --> 25:55.689
- You told the papers yet?
- I don't need that. All the reporters.

25:55.724 --> 25:57.925
There might be a few bucks in it for you.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.150
A mate is working for the 'Express'.
I can call if you want.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.881
You think I wanna be in the papers?

26:08.916 --> 26:12.389
- It could help if we decided to move.
- What if they think it's all fake?

26:12.560 --> 26:16.042
They won't. Besides, they'll pay
good money if they like the story.

26:16.077 --> 26:18.612
Tell them it's off.

26:20.840 --> 26:23.382
It's too late for that.

26:25.800 --> 26:30.154
- This is where it came at me.
- What did, Mr Maynard?

26:30.240 --> 26:34.560
It was like a presence.
A ghostal manifestation.

26:35.682 --> 26:37.925
- Did you see it?
- No.

26:37.960 --> 26:41.222
- Did it touch you?
- No, but...

26:41.280 --> 26:43.408
I was terrified, Mr Smith.

26:43.920 --> 26:46.314
I bet.

26:47.600 --> 26:50.490
I don't think there's anything here
that'll interest our readers.

26:50.525 --> 26:52.848
Everybody likes a ghost story.

26:52.883 --> 26:55.125
You'll need a ghost for that.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.703
- What are you saying, Mr Smith?
- I am a reporter.

26:57.738 --> 27:00.247
I don't see anything to report on.

27:00.282 --> 27:02.891
- If you stuck around...
- I'll see myself out.

27:08.000 --> 27:10.048
Well done, soft ass.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.204
Shut up.

27:17.080 --> 27:21.051
Really, Mr Maynand,
I'm a very busy man.

27:32.120 --> 27:35.329
Look at my hair in that picture.
It's awful, isn't it?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.044
And they don't even bloody mention me.

27:38.079 --> 27:41.911
- It's not fair, is it, love?
- It sure isn't.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.885
Can we come see it?

27:44.920 --> 27:47.082
My mum doesn't like people
coming into the house.

27:47.117 --> 27:48.805
- She says so?
- My father does.

27:48.840 --> 27:51.491
- No, it's not true.
- How much are the papers paying you?

27:51.526 --> 27:54.131
- Leave her alone, she is tired.
- Go away.

27:54.166 --> 27:56.282
- Jerk.
- Wetpants.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.367
Who are all those people?

28:06.760 --> 28:09.309
Idiots.

28:11.700 --> 28:13.645
What's going on here?

28:13.680 --> 28:16.684
- A ghost performance.
- Costs a pound, but it's worth it.

28:17.080 --> 28:20.562
Shift out.
This is my bloody house!

28:21.000 --> 28:24.049
This is my daughter's room.
Not a lot happens in there.

28:26.760 --> 28:28.762
I'll be right back.

28:32.080 --> 28:35.084
- What the hell you are playing at?
- I'm making us a quid, love.

28:35.119 --> 28:37.753
- Get rid of them.
- You wanted a new kitchen, or not?

28:37.754 --> 28:39.745
Now!

28:42.160 --> 28:45.801
- Are we next?
- No, the show is over. Go away.

28:45.836 --> 28:47.036
Dad.

28:48.400 --> 28:49.800
Dad!

28:54.440 --> 28:56.442
- What?
- Can I have ten shilling, please?

28:56.640 --> 29:00.155
- Sod off.
- Angry money.

29:11.160 --> 29:13.770
A pound?

30:03.680 --> 30:06.604
I thought you were putting it up,
not taking it down.

30:07.080 --> 30:09.815
I didn't do it.

30:15.800 --> 30:17.125
Where did you get that?

30:17.160 --> 30:20.050
I nicked it from the shop.
It's horrible.

30:20.400 --> 30:23.297
You thief, give it.

30:49.600 --> 30:52.887
- It tastes like honey.
- Like liquid acid.

30:52.888 --> 30:55.114
I can't spit it out.

31:31.360 --> 31:34.762
- Who wants to talk to me?
- Nobody.

31:34.960 --> 31:37.167
Then thou must bugger off.

31:43.560 --> 31:45.927
- I'm tipsy.
- Me too.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.844
You've ever been drunk before?

31:48.920 --> 31:52.686
Yeah, sometimes I take a bit
of sherry of my mum.

31:52.721 --> 31:54.525
Are you coming to my birthday?

31:54.560 --> 31:57.643
- Of course, if I'm invited.
- Of course.

32:06.120 --> 32:08.786
Was that you, at the town hall?

32:13.840 --> 32:15.569
You look pretty.

32:30.520 --> 32:33.629
Knock it off.

32:35.120 --> 32:37.337
Get off me.

32:37.760 --> 32:40.156
Stop it.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.183
What are you laughing at?

32:55.480 --> 32:57.801
- What do you think it is?
- What?

32:59.240 --> 33:01.965
- It.
- I don't know.

33:02.800 --> 33:05.445
A girl, maybe a boy.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.673
- That makes it easier, doesn't it?
- What do you think then?

33:10.080 --> 33:12.128
I'll tell you what I think it is.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.723
What?

33:15.040 --> 33:17.854
Evil.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.887
- Where were you tonight?
- With Lucy.

33:24.120 --> 33:30.162
Good. I'm glad you found a friend.
An alive one, that is.

33:30.280 --> 33:32.611
Don't know what you're on about.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.445
And then these bodiless hands
come around the door...

33:37.480 --> 33:40.325
Wearing our daughter's gloves
and start conducting...

33:40.360 --> 33:43.029
Yeah, you were good and all.
Get the right timing.

33:43.030 --> 33:47.711
- And your family?
- Got them fearing out.

33:48.640 --> 33:53.931
Sure they appreciate having a big
tough guy like you around them?

33:55.280 --> 33:58.517
- Who are you then?
- A friend.

33:58.960 --> 34:02.407
Well, friend, maybe it's time
you buggered off home.

34:02.680 --> 34:05.206
- I could suggest the same to you.
- Yeah?

34:05.880 --> 34:08.884
- You fucking twat!
- Len, leave it.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.261
Leave it.

34:16.800 --> 34:20.282
I can't fucking believe it.
Fucking asshole.

34:20.317 --> 34:24.143
- Maybe he had a point.
- What? I thought you were my mate.

34:24.179 --> 34:26.367
That's why I'm saying
you should be home.

34:28.199 --> 34:29.764
We had a row.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.525
So? Go home and make it up to her.

34:32.560 --> 34:36.565
- I don't even know how.
- You're married, lad. You don't need to.

35:19.120 --> 35:20.804
You bastard.

35:22.040 --> 35:25.845
- Am I that bad?
- Not you.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.883
- You've been drinking.
- Not so much you'd notice.

35:33.640 --> 35:35.165
Look what he did.

35:35.520 --> 35:37.682
He wants to split us.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.687
He's done a good job, isn't it?

35:42.560 --> 35:44.449
Only if we let it.

35:55.080 --> 35:57.651
- Hello, you must be Sally. Come in.
- Hello.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.931
Am I the first?

36:00.320 --> 36:03.802
Did Lucy not mention that, sweetheart?
It's just the two of you today.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.528
Happy birthday.

36:14.340 --> 36:16.946
What's up?
Don't you like it?

36:17.100 --> 36:18.909
I can always take it back.

36:19.100 --> 36:20.670
I love it.

36:26.300 --> 36:28.716
Your nose.

36:31.420 --> 36:32.865
Where's your dad?

36:32.900 --> 36:37.064
Ran off with a scarlet woman.
Mum tells everyone he's on nights.

36:45.620 --> 36:47.782
Sally, love, come here.

36:49.700 --> 36:50.940
Sit down, love.

36:53.980 --> 36:56.631
Can you do me a favour, please?

36:57.140 --> 37:00.303
Can you make sure Lucy
doesn't go in your house?

37:01.820 --> 37:03.629
- Promise?
- Promise.

37:05.740 --> 37:08.422
- Thanks, love.
- Is it because of the ghost?

37:10.260 --> 37:11.910
Yes, love. Yeah.

37:12.860 --> 37:15.067
Sally, come here!

37:15.380 --> 37:17.977
Go on, then.

37:19.740 --> 37:21.745
Let's pretend we're 'The Sweet'.

37:21.780 --> 37:25.182
I'll be the drummer.
You can be Brian Connolly.

38:51.460 --> 38:54.031
Why are you crying?

39:08.900 --> 39:13.026
- Are mum and dad in, sweet?
- No.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.501
- Do you mind if I wait, then?
- What is it about?

39:16.540 --> 39:20.261
You've got an evil spirit
and I can get rid of it.

39:22.380 --> 39:24.701
If you wanna get rid of it, that is.

39:29.900 --> 39:31.982
Tell them to call me, will you?

39:32.140 --> 39:34.638
Alright.

39:49.940 --> 39:52.246
Leave it, Len.

39:54.500 --> 39:56.914
That's enough.

40:05.580 --> 40:08.263
Yes, love?

40:36.580 --> 40:38.801
What is it, love?

40:39.940 --> 40:42.260
What's going on?

40:50.260 --> 40:53.309
- Who is it and what does it bloody wants?
- Leave me alone. I'm tired.

40:53.344 --> 40:55.302
You know more than you're
telling me, young lady.

40:55.780 --> 40:59.102
- Get dressed. We're going to Father Clifton.
- I'm not going anywhere.

40:59.137 --> 41:02.630
- Go as you are, then.
- Little bitch!

41:04.860 --> 41:07.185
I'll deal with you later.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.746
It's 4 in the morning, love.
He is not up.

41:09.781 --> 41:11.105
I don't bloody care.

41:22.580 --> 41:26.338
- Shall I go?
- Yeah, you go.

41:26.740 --> 41:31.189
The whole fucking community
knows about us.

41:33.100 --> 41:36.625
The ghost of a young girl, is it, Jenny?

41:36.660 --> 41:39.630
Why didn't you come to me before?

41:39.665 --> 41:41.429
I thought you would
chase me out of here.

41:46.540 --> 41:49.625
- What do you want me to do?
- Get rid of it, Father.

41:49.660 --> 41:53.221
From what you've told me,
that would require an exorcism.

41:53.256 --> 41:55.202
An exorcism?

41:56.620 --> 42:00.022
It's a very serious undertaking.

42:00.220 --> 42:03.224
I would need to get permission
from the bishop.

42:03.500 --> 42:06.231
Jesus! So what are we gonna do now?

42:08.900 --> 42:10.902
I want a word with you.

42:15.300 --> 42:18.842
- I'm sorry.
- It's alright.

42:18.980 --> 42:22.414
I was a bit harsh last night.
Forgiven?

42:26.260 --> 42:29.389
You know, maybe he'll go
on his own account.

42:29.740 --> 42:31.822
You never know, he might
be gone already.

42:45.380 --> 42:47.865
Here we are, boys and girls.
Nearsby Monastery.

42:51.100 --> 42:54.546
- Who goes first? Oliver definitely.
- Come on, guys.

42:55.060 --> 42:58.826
And here was the refectory.
Which was?

42:59.060 --> 43:02.507
- Where the monks had dinner and tea, sir.
- Very good, Lucy.

43:02.700 --> 43:05.783
They had two meals a day in
summer and only one in winter.

43:05.818 --> 43:07.305
What did they eat, sir?

43:07.340 --> 43:10.065
Just the essentials.
Vegetables, meat and bread.

43:10.100 --> 43:14.230
Although they kept bees for the honey.
Sugar hadn't been invented yet.

43:27.860 --> 43:29.988
- What have you got?
- Mustard.

43:30.220 --> 43:33.190
- What the bloody hell is wrong with you?
- I like it.

43:33.820 --> 43:36.000
Lesbians!

43:36.020 --> 43:38.226
Come on.

43:39.140 --> 43:41.721
I'm off for a pee.

43:41.780 --> 43:44.260
Try not to get it in your knickers.

45:08.300 --> 45:10.680
- What is it?
- I'm not allowed in.

45:10.715 --> 45:13.763
- Why not?
- Because of the ghost, sir.

45:13.820 --> 45:16.187
You don't believe in that
nonsense, do you?

45:17.820 --> 45:20.473
Come on.

45:24.660 --> 45:27.425
It's real, sir.
She told me.

45:27.460 --> 45:32.261
He wakes her up at night and plays
with her. That's why she's tired, sir.

45:32.296 --> 45:36.845
- You're watching too much TV, young lady.
- We don't have a TV, sir.

45:46.420 --> 45:48.149
How are you feeling, Sally?

45:48.300 --> 45:50.507
- I'm alright, sir.
- Are you sure?

45:51.380 --> 45:54.111
Lucy is gonna look after you,
till your mother gets back, okay?

45:54.146 --> 45:56.580
She's not supposed to be here.

45:57.740 --> 46:01.222
Yes, but just this once won't hurt her.

46:02.340 --> 46:04.741
See you later.

46:38.700 --> 46:42.705
- You don't have to stay if you don't want.
- No, it's okay.

46:44.300 --> 46:46.780
- Where's your lav?
- Upstairs.

46:48.100 --> 46:49.705
Are you incontinent?

46:49.740 --> 46:52.550
- I used to have to wear a nappy.
- So did I.

46:52.585 --> 46:55.233
Not when you were 10.

46:57.580 --> 47:00.231
- Black-out.
- I have to go.

47:54.860 --> 47:58.512
- Is that you, Sally?
- What?

47:59.140 --> 48:01.335
Nothing.

49:01.580 --> 49:04.345
- Sally! Please!
- I'm trying!

49:10.580 --> 49:12.764
What's up?

49:13.900 --> 49:16.314
Lucy, come back!

49:35.620 --> 49:38.076
Hello, Sally.

49:38.111 --> 49:40.381
You know why I'm here, don't you?

49:41.100 --> 49:44.991
Didn't you listen to what I said the
other night? You promised me, didn't you?

49:45.100 --> 49:48.149
- Is she gonna be okay?
- I had to take her to the hospital.

49:48.184 --> 49:50.105
- Can I see her?
- No, you can't see her.

49:50.140 --> 49:53.462
And you won't be seeing her again
if it's up to me, young lady.

49:53.980 --> 49:56.065
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

49:56.100 --> 49:59.263
She thinks you're the world.
You were her only friend.

50:00.700 --> 50:02.345
What's going on?

50:02.380 --> 50:05.442
Your bloody daughter, that's what's going on.
I've asked her...

50:05.477 --> 50:08.465
not to let Lucy in the house.
She promised me.

50:08.500 --> 50:11.709
- I had to get her to the hospital.
- I had no idea.

50:11.744 --> 50:14.387
Well, you do now.

50:14.500 --> 50:18.027
- Mum, I didn't... I didn't mean to...
- You wicked little cow!

50:18.062 --> 50:21.142
- I'm sorry.
- How could you do that?

50:24.860 --> 50:27.054
Bitch!

50:35.140 --> 50:37.982
Do something to her.

50:53.420 --> 50:58.128
Don't. Stop it.

50:58.900 --> 51:01.500
Stop it. Please, don't.

51:02.140 --> 51:05.252
Please... Please, don't.

52:28.740 --> 52:32.586
Jenny, oh my god.
Come on.

52:52.660 --> 52:55.476
- Did the bell go off?
- Yes.

52:55.860 --> 52:59.600
- I gotta go pee.
- That pee can wait five minutes. Sit down.

53:00.260 --> 53:02.667
I wanna chat.

53:03.060 --> 53:07.288
Lucy mentioned something about you and the...

53:08.580 --> 53:10.776
presence.

53:10.811 --> 53:13.344
Everybody is frightened of her,

53:13.540 --> 53:17.625
because she does scary things.
But I just think she's lonely.

53:17.660 --> 53:21.540
- 'She'?
- There's a painting of her in the town hall.

53:38.660 --> 53:41.594
It's not as bad as it looks, love.

53:46.380 --> 53:49.069
What's up, love?

53:59.340 --> 54:02.087
What happened?

55:23.140 --> 55:27.005
Go on, cry.
Like you made my mum cry.

55:58.060 --> 56:01.117
Love?

56:24.300 --> 56:27.687
Sally, you'll catch your death.

56:28.780 --> 56:30.748
That's where he found me.

56:31.260 --> 56:34.188
He took something from me.

56:35.380 --> 56:37.903
Sally, come inside now. Please.

56:37.938 --> 56:40.567
It's lonely in there.
And it's always night.

57:17.220 --> 57:19.779
I'll get you away.

57:20.980 --> 57:23.461
I'll get you both away.

57:27.580 --> 57:29.584
Don't get near her, she's a witch.

57:29.619 --> 57:33.773
Lucy is off because of her. She put a spell
on her that made her wee herself to death.

57:53.420 --> 57:56.025
Just give it a chance, will you, love?

58:12.580 --> 58:15.186
- It's ghost-free.
- But I'm not moving in.

58:16.580 --> 58:18.947
Well, we're just gonna sit and wait?

58:19.140 --> 58:21.950
- What else can we do?
- I'm worried about our Sally.

58:21.985 --> 58:23.942
So am I.

58:24.140 --> 58:26.791
But just not enough to give up
your dream home, is that it?

58:27.020 --> 58:30.183
You bastard. It's always
someone else's fault, isn't it?

58:30.218 --> 58:31.865
I suppose I brought this on us, didn't I?

58:31.900 --> 58:35.417
- It's not my fault there's a ghost.
- It never is! Take some responsibility!

58:35.452 --> 58:40.283
- That's what I'm trying to do now!
- Try a bit harder! Look at it!

58:48.820 --> 58:52.188
- You're a hard man to find, Mr Maynard.
- And who might you be?

58:53.100 --> 58:54.909
Your daughter's teacher.

58:55.020 --> 58:58.069
She asked me to find out
about the ghost.

59:00.020 --> 59:04.419
What I found... She was the
daughter of the local land owner.

59:04.660 --> 59:08.345
Her carriage lost a wheel
in the Castlefield Woods.

59:08.380 --> 59:10.531
She wandered off and they
found her the next morning.

59:10.566 --> 59:14.788
Strangled and half dead.
She also had her tongue cut out.

59:14.823 --> 59:18.411
She was 13 years old.
Just like your daughter.

59:19.140 --> 59:22.857
- And this is in our house?
- From what Sally tells me, yes.

59:24.780 --> 59:27.362
- So?
- So what?

59:27.660 --> 59:30.590
You could think of moving.

59:30.860 --> 59:33.101
I thought of nothing else.

59:33.136 --> 59:35.068
- What's stopping you?
- You've met my wife.

59:35.460 --> 59:38.862
I'm sure she'd see sense,
if you told her what I've just told you.

59:38.897 --> 59:42.069
Well, that's our business, isn't it?

59:44.740 --> 59:49.428
- So what's your interest in this anyway?
- A teacher is concerned for his pupils.

59:49.463 --> 59:53.186
One I happen to be fond of.
Sally is a very special girl.

59:53.420 --> 59:55.985
I see.

59:56.420 --> 59:59.359
- It's like that, is it?
- Like what?

59:59.500 --> 01:00:03.983
It won't be the first time a teacher's
taking a shine to a pretty young girl.

01:00:08.860 --> 01:00:13.076
I'll leave that. In case you don't
remember tomorrow morning.

01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.829
What are you looking at?

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:41.957
- What's the verdict, Father?
- He doesn't feel there are enough grounds.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.751
- So, that's is it, isn't it?
- I'm afraid so.

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.820
- We'll have to move.
- That wouldn't be the end of the world.

01:00:50.855 --> 01:00:55.747
Don't be a stranger.
The church can be a great comfort...

01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:03.628
But you have to do something.

01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:08.462
And be kicked off?

01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:12.063
You would like that, eh?

01:01:25.300 --> 01:01:29.397
I found out some stuff about your ghost
and tried to talk to your father.

01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:32.116
Come on, get in.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:38.889
Will you be okay?

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:44.232
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:06.502
I'm sorry you got murdered.

01:02:07.100 --> 01:02:10.397
But it's time for you to leave me alone.

01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:32.465
Come. love.

01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:25.223
An item belonging to the deceased
would be of great help.

01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:45.465
This is what is in our house.
We need your help.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:49.254
- I already gave my answer to you wife.
- Well, he wants another one.

01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:53.385
Out of the question.
I could loose my collar.

01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.946
You'd loose that anyway
if we made this public.

01:04:02.700 --> 01:04:06.068
- Who took these?
- That's not important.

01:04:06.220 --> 01:04:09.582
Yeah, the light's a bit off on that one,
but what can you do?

01:04:09.617 --> 01:04:12.385
Blackmail is a very serious offence,
Mr Maynard.

01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:15.583
- So is shagging your housekeeper.
- If you're a catholic priest.

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:20.524
- What's she doing on this one?
- That one? I think she is kneeling.

01:05:17.220 --> 01:05:19.951
Please speak to us.

01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:26.684
Do you understand us?

01:05:29.820 --> 01:05:32.187
Then why don't you speak to us?

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:40.257
Are you dumb?

01:05:42.780 --> 01:05:44.782
Will you go into The Light?

01:05:50.220 --> 01:05:52.871
Is there something unfinished here?

01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:58.834
Who with?

01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:12.150
Oh, love.

01:06:15.180 --> 01:06:19.140
Is she in danger?
Who from?

01:06:21.620 --> 01:06:25.102
Tell me.

01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:27.559
No!

01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.067
Get off her!

01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:41.860
- Get her out.
- Come, love.

01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:45.469
Come, quick!
We'll go to my house.

01:06:48.140 --> 01:06:51.867
I'm sorry.
I failed you.

01:06:52.740 --> 01:06:54.629
They were too much for us.

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:57.624
- 'They'?
- There's more than one spirit in the house.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.984
I felt a positive presence.

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:06.589
And there's another one.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.220
And the positive presence
is a young girl...

01:07:11.255 --> 01:07:14.941
who has caused most
of the poltergeist activity.

01:07:14.976 --> 01:07:17.420
In an attempt to drive you away.

01:07:17.455 --> 01:07:20.822
Not to harm you,
but to protect you.

01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.789
What does the other one want?

01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.751
She wasn't the first.
There were others before her.

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:47.904
Peasant girls.

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:53.185
They were all rendered dumb.
Just like her.

01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:57.771
Tongue cut out.

01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:01.823
But she was educated.

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:09.326
Before she passed away, she managed to
give a written description of her attacker.

01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.488
So, who was it?

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:27.903
It was a monk from the
Nearsby monastery,

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:31.465
praying on the innocence of young girls.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.825
He could have caused great
embarrassment to the church.

01:08:34.859 --> 01:08:40.578
That's why he was trialled,
hung and buried in secret.

01:08:40.613 --> 01:08:44.861
- Thanks for telling us.
- I'm telling you now.

01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:22.060
- What's up?
- I'll best be off, eh?

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:26.015
- I thought you were gonna help us out.
- I've done my bit, okay?

01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:31.264
What's Rita gonna say, when
I tell her you chickened out?

01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:40.707
You're a very ruthless man, Len Maynard.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:55.941
Don't mess with the responses.
Or we'll be in trouble.

01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:10.323
Let us proceed.

01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:15.311
All holy saints of God.

01:10:20.140 --> 01:10:24.683
- Respond.
- Pray for us.

01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:31.544
Free us from all evil, Lord.

01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:38.264
From all sins, from sudden
and unforeseen death.

01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:42.069
Deliver us.

01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:18.471
Listen to our call for help.

01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:24.186
Strength terror, Lord.
The beasts that destroy thy vineyard.

01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:28.061
See the cross of the Lord.
Run, enemy powers.

01:11:32.660 --> 01:11:35.902
- It's freezing here.
- Close your top button, softy.

01:12:04.780 --> 01:12:07.228
Freaking hell.

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:11.422
Go on, after you.

01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:14.068
- It's your blooody house.
- Get up.

01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:22.665
It's gone in there.

01:12:24.100 --> 01:12:26.774
No matter.

01:12:29.620 --> 01:12:32.021
You place is loneliness.

01:12:32.860 --> 01:12:35.784
Your home is in a serpent's nidus.

01:12:35.819 --> 01:12:38.777
Go back to where you cam from!

01:12:42.460 --> 01:12:45.828
Do I have to wait for you here
all night, you bunch of idlers?

01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.468
Be gone, seducer!

01:13:04.900 --> 01:13:07.665
The blood of the martyrs command you!

01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:13.766
Go on.

01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:17.541
The Force of the exalted Christian
faith commands you!

01:13:17.820 --> 01:13:22.820
The exalted Christ commands you!

01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:41.281
- Thanks, Father.
- No heart feelings, eh?

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:48.313
The negatives.

01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:56.382
If any of these gets out,
I'll skin you alive.

01:15:08.420 --> 01:15:11.503
I'm sure he'll see the
funny side of it later.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.385
Give me one of that.

01:17:29.380 --> 01:17:31.223
You still here, aren't you?

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.290
Mum!

01:17:41.620 --> 01:17:44.349
Mum!

01:18:30.820 --> 01:18:34.084
Mum! Dad!

01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:41.381
Sweetheart.

01:19:19.180 --> 01:19:21.617
I'm gonna get you out!

01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.129
Oh my god, sweetheart.

01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:04.197
Mum, dad, help!

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:07.540
Help me!

01:20:07.575 --> 01:20:10.371
Mum!

01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:15.281
Mum!

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:19.742
Mum!

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:26.601
Oh my god, Sally. You alright?

01:21:28.420 --> 01:21:31.753
Come on, love.

01:21:31.820 --> 01:21:33.743
We're gonna get you out of here.

01:21:35.260 --> 01:21:38.577
- Quick.
- Come on.

01:21:47.060 --> 01:21:49.631
