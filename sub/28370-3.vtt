09:33.137 --> 09:34.791
She don't know
what she knows.

09:34.835 --> 09:37.881
I got ears on the ground
in case anybody hears something.

09:37.925 --> 09:39.970
Tyson will be back.

09:40.014 --> 09:40.971
[scoffs quietly]

09:41.015 --> 09:42.320
Eat your food.

09:45.149 --> 09:47.282
[sighs]

09:47.325 --> 09:50.111
Okay, next on
the agenda.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.113
As we all know,
Guiding Hope could use

09:52.156 --> 09:53.636
a little PR boost.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.986
We only have 75
Instagram followers.

09:56.030 --> 09:57.118
How can we
up our game?

09:57.161 --> 09:58.815
What up, Fievel?

09:58.859 --> 10:00.295
Uh...

10:00.338 --> 10:02.297
This meeting's about to
suck a whole lot less.

10:02.340 --> 10:03.472
Water guy is here.

10:03.515 --> 10:06.257
It's, uh, Felix.

10:06.301 --> 10:07.302
Remember when he
called him Phyllis

10:07.345 --> 10:09.217
for, like, two weeks?
[laughs]

10:09.260 --> 10:11.915
I think you forgot to put the
new bottle in the dispenser.

10:11.959 --> 10:13.874
Sorry, I just assumed
you wanted to do it yourself.

10:13.917 --> 10:15.397
Most men do.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.094
FELIX:
No, no, no, that's not it.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.749
Just that it's, uh,
part of your job.

10:22.926 --> 10:24.536
Sign this.
Okay.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
Unless the pen
is too heavy for you.

10:28.279 --> 10:31.456
Damn. These are the moments
where I really wish I could see.

10:35.722 --> 10:37.027
FELIX:
Uh, right.

10:37.071 --> 10:39.334
Where was I?

10:39.377 --> 10:40.727
Uh, getting owned
by the water guy.

10:40.770 --> 10:42.554
FELIX:
Thank you, Murphy.

10:42.598 --> 10:43.686
We were talking about
getting Guiding Hope

10:43.730 --> 10:45.079
some name recognition.

10:45.122 --> 10:46.428
We could do a calendar

10:46.471 --> 10:48.125
of all our cutest puppies
in training.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.345
Wait, we should go
to a high school.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.173
You running low on Adderall?

10:52.216 --> 10:53.478
[laughs, mutters]

10:53.522 --> 10:55.350
Yes, Felix. I take Adderall.

10:55.393 --> 10:57.569
That's why I have zero focus
and I'm late every day.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.702
No, seriously, you know,
high school kids

10:59.746 --> 11:01.486
are total jerks
to blind people.

11:01.530 --> 11:02.966
And don't you always
do those outreach...

11:03.010 --> 11:05.360
things, you know?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.188
We need to do one
at a high school.

11:07.231 --> 11:09.364
FELIX:
Yeah, high school kids
are the worst, so...

11:09.407 --> 11:11.018
Ben Fields told everyone
at my high school

11:11.061 --> 11:13.455
he caught me masturbating
to the Blink-182 album cover

11:13.498 --> 11:14.717
during lunch.

11:14.761 --> 11:15.892
[laughs]

11:16.980 --> 11:18.199
Which album?

11:18.242 --> 11:19.591
No, none. It was a lie.

11:19.635 --> 11:20.941
Obviously, but
it haunted me

11:20.984 --> 11:22.986
until the day I graduated.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.771
The entire school sang

11:24.814 --> 11:26.729
"All the Small Things"
when I got my diploma.

11:26.773 --> 11:28.731
[snorts, laughs]
Oh.
[giggles]

11:28.775 --> 11:30.385
My point is,

11:30.428 --> 11:32.735
is that, uh,
high school kids are awful.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.606
Right. Exactly.

11:34.650 --> 11:36.260
So I can call some
local schools and see

11:36.304 --> 11:38.219
if anyone's
interested.

11:38.262 --> 11:41.091
We might get some volunteers
and, at the very least,

11:41.135 --> 11:43.050
Instagram followers.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.791
Okay, but you do realize

11:44.834 --> 11:47.097
you're offering
to do actual work, right?

11:47.141 --> 11:49.665
Yes, Felix, I realize.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.755
Okay. I'll allow it.

11:52.799 --> 11:54.801
All right, I want to
talk to you guys about

11:54.844 --> 11:56.672
telltale dog
behavior, all right?

11:56.716 --> 11:58.761
[quietly]:
You are a transparent idiot.

11:58.805 --> 12:00.284
[whispers]:
Whatever.

12:00.328 --> 12:02.460
I just got my pass
to find Keira.

12:02.504 --> 12:04.071
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Fairview High School...

12:04.114 --> 12:05.507
You wanted to see me?

12:07.378 --> 12:08.553
What?

12:08.597 --> 12:10.860
You wanted to see me.Yes.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.732
I called Fairview High,

12:12.775 --> 12:15.082
and we're all set for
a presentation tomorrow morning.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.910
What time do we
have to be there?

12:16.953 --> 12:19.739
Oh, I-I thought Jess and I
would just handle this one.

12:19.782 --> 12:21.915
Jess? She's a vet. I always do
the outreach presentations.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.744
No, no, I know, but, I mean,
you have so much work to do here

12:24.787 --> 12:26.789
and, like, you're the boss
this week and...

12:26.833 --> 12:28.617
Well, yeah.

12:28.660 --> 12:31.011
I mean, look, I don't want
to go back to high school,

12:31.054 --> 12:32.577
but my main objective
is making sure

12:32.621 --> 12:34.188
that Guiding Hope
is represented well.

12:34.231 --> 12:35.580
You don't think I can do that?

12:35.624 --> 12:37.539
[chuckles]

12:39.193 --> 12:41.108
Oh, absolutely not.

12:41.151 --> 12:43.458
JESS:
So how are you gonna find Keira

12:43.501 --> 12:45.199
if you're stuck with Felix?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.723
Oh, easy. I'll just ditch him.

12:47.767 --> 12:51.118
And while he's doing the dumb
assembly, I'll go find her.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.815
'Cause stoners always ditch
assemblies to get high,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.991
so all I got to do is
figure out where she is.

12:55.035 --> 12:56.645
Hey.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.342
[Max grunts]

12:58.386 --> 13:00.562
JESS:
Hey, there.

13:00.605 --> 13:03.043
I'm gonna leave
you two lovebirds alone.

13:12.530 --> 13:15.011
What are you
still doing here?

13:15.055 --> 13:19.494
Well, I tried walking down
the stairs, but I couldn't.

13:19.537 --> 13:21.496
Yeah, I'm sure you can do it.

13:21.539 --> 13:24.020
[laughing]: I almost
passed out from the pain.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.849
Look, I'm sorry, babe.
You broke it, you bought it.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.459
Gonna have
to crash here tonight.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.766
But you stayed here last night.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.507
So?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.814
So, we're supposed to be
this, like, casual sex thing.

13:36.511 --> 13:38.295
And what if I wanted
more than casual?

13:38.339 --> 13:41.255
Then go hang out with the other
lesbians in this house.

13:41.298 --> 13:43.300
Get your ass over here.

13:44.519 --> 13:45.825
[sighs]

13:56.966 --> 13:58.707
How was your day?

13:58.750 --> 14:00.404
What?

14:00.448 --> 14:03.320
Your-your day.
How-how was it?

14:08.238 --> 14:10.023
[breathing heavily]

14:24.515 --> 14:26.517
[toilet flushing]

14:32.306 --> 14:34.395
[gasps]Hey.

14:34.438 --> 14:38.965
Murphy, what the hell
are you doing in the bathtub?

14:39.008 --> 14:40.705
Max is in my bed.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.621
He's, like,
touching me and stuff.

14:43.665 --> 14:45.536
Welcome to dating.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.190
I don't want to date anyone.

14:47.234 --> 14:48.931
Well, I hate
to break it

14:48.975 --> 14:52.108
to you, kid, but you're kind of
dating this dude.

14:52.152 --> 14:54.415
[door opens]

14:54.458 --> 14:55.895
[door closes]

14:58.375 --> 15:00.334
There you are.

15:00.377 --> 15:03.598
[grunting]

15:03.641 --> 15:05.600
Can you grab me some more ice?

15:05.643 --> 15:08.995
Here. Fill it up, please?

15:09.038 --> 15:11.040
Thank you.

15:25.837 --> 15:27.404
[sighs, clears throat]

15:31.974 --> 15:34.542
Everything okay, babe?

15:34.585 --> 15:37.414
Don't call me babe.

15:37.458 --> 15:38.938
Okay.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.941
I'd, uh...

15:41.984 --> 15:45.466
I'd help you pick it up,
but I can't bend over, so...

15:45.509 --> 15:48.860
Maybe you'd be more comfortable
in your own apartment.

15:48.904 --> 15:50.819
I don't think I'd be
comfortable anywhere, babe.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.995
[ice cubes clattering]

15:53.039 --> 15:54.866
I'm not the
ice girl, okay?

15:56.694 --> 15:59.045
You seem pretty icy to me.

15:59.088 --> 16:02.483
This "us" or whatever it is,
it's not my thing.

16:02.526 --> 16:03.919
So you got to go.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.442
I don't believe you.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.662
Stop acting like
you know me.

16:07.705 --> 16:11.100
I don't know you,
and you don't know me.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.972
Which is why we're getting
to know each other.

16:13.015 --> 16:14.712
I don't want to do that.

16:14.756 --> 16:16.888
I like my life
exactly the way it is.

16:16.932 --> 16:18.368
Right.

16:18.412 --> 16:19.891
All your drunk
and meaningless sex.

16:19.935 --> 16:21.110
I'm sure it's very fulfilling.

16:21.154 --> 16:23.025
It is.
I bet.

16:23.069 --> 16:24.157
Have fun with it.
I will.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.375
Great.
Great.

16:33.731 --> 16:35.603
Hello?

16:35.646 --> 16:37.648
MAX:
Down here.
[grunts]

16:39.911 --> 16:41.609
What happened to you?

16:41.652 --> 16:43.480
I broke my penis.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.047
[laughs]

16:45.091 --> 16:46.788
You still smashing
that married one?

16:46.831 --> 16:49.878
Husband finally find out
and take a bat to it?

16:49.921 --> 16:52.402
No. I ended that weeks ago
because I'm a good person,

16:52.446 --> 16:55.318
and this is how God repays me.

16:55.362 --> 16:57.625
[laughs]
Well, look, um,

16:57.668 --> 17:00.193
I actually came to talk
'cause I need a favor.

17:00.236 --> 17:04.153
Oh, now you want to talk.What's that supposed to mean?

17:04.197 --> 17:06.068
You should have told me
your little cousin's missing.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.201
My auntie told me to
find out what happened,

17:08.244 --> 17:10.377
but Nia's riding me
and told me to drop it.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.726
Just go behind Nia's back.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.989
And end up missing, too?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.077
Yeah, okay.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.079
Murphy thinks Tyson's dead.

17:17.123 --> 17:20.082
Murphy?
What, you been talking to her?

17:20.126 --> 17:21.910
Wait, let me guess.

17:21.953 --> 17:23.738
She's the one who
did this to you.

17:23.781 --> 17:25.609
So you messing with her?

17:25.653 --> 17:28.482
I was. Eh, but I'm off it.

17:28.525 --> 17:31.050
Good. Girl's trouble.

17:31.093 --> 17:33.922
Oh, what's this favor
you needed?

17:33.965 --> 17:35.837
I need you to help me
skim a little.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.404
How much is a little?

17:37.447 --> 17:39.101
15 stacks.

17:39.145 --> 17:41.321
[laughs]

17:41.364 --> 17:43.236
Man, that's not really a little.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.455
Look, we don't make the
drop until next Thursday.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.979
I'll pay you back
before we have to square it up.

17:52.245 --> 17:54.290
Don't let this come back on me.

18:00.514 --> 18:02.690
[shudders]

18:02.733 --> 18:04.909
I swore I would never step foot
in a high school ever again.

18:04.953 --> 18:07.608
The things I do
for my career.
Oh, man.

18:07.651 --> 18:09.131
[exhales] I'm not
feeling so good.

18:09.175 --> 18:10.741
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

18:10.785 --> 18:12.830
Now? We're about to go on.

18:12.874 --> 18:15.398
Just start without me.No. This was your thing.

18:15.442 --> 18:17.444
Calm down. You do these stupid
presentations all the time.

18:17.487 --> 18:19.315
Not to an auditorium
full of teenagers.

18:19.359 --> 18:21.230
Well, unless you want
an auditorium full of teenagers

18:21.274 --> 18:23.841
to see me vom on stage,
you're gonna have to start.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.236
Oh, God.
No, no, no, no, no.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.803
This can't be happening.
Not right now.

18:28.846 --> 18:30.848
What?My eyes are watering.

18:30.892 --> 18:32.372
You're crying?No, watering.

18:32.415 --> 18:33.982
They tear up when I get nervous.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.462
It's glandular.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.724
I'll just wear my sunglasses.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.857
Hurry.

18:45.211 --> 18:46.821
I got it.

18:46.864 --> 18:48.388
Hi, Dean.Uh, thank you.

18:53.393 --> 18:55.090
Pumpkin, how you feeling?

18:55.134 --> 18:56.918
Fine.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.096
[clears throat]

19:01.140 --> 19:03.751
Talked to the, uh,
school nurse.

19:03.794 --> 19:08.147
She told me that you
got your period today.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.713
[clears throat]

19:09.757 --> 19:11.889
So that's pretty cool.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.848
Right? Being a-a
woman and all?

19:18.418 --> 19:19.984
Okay, okay.

19:20.028 --> 19:21.508
Okay, we have a special guest
here today

19:21.551 --> 19:24.075
to talk to us about blindness.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.730
Here from Guiding Hope,
give a warm welcome

19:26.774 --> 19:29.124
to Felix Bell.

19:29.168 --> 19:31.300
[scattered applause]

19:31.344 --> 19:33.563
FELIX:
Thank you, Principal Lee.

19:33.607 --> 19:38.829
So, uh, like he said, I'm here
to talk to you about blindness.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.788
That's fun, huh?

19:40.831 --> 19:42.398
[student coughs]

19:45.358 --> 19:47.795
I mean, not...
Being blind isn't fun.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.014
It's actually very un-fun
at times,

19:50.058 --> 19:52.887
but you're out of class.

19:52.930 --> 19:55.237
That's pretty bitchin'.

19:55.281 --> 19:57.326
[indistinct whispers]

19:57.370 --> 19:59.198
Some sighted people think
that being blind

19:59.241 --> 20:01.635
is all about giving up
your independence,

20:01.678 --> 20:03.811
but that's just not true.

20:03.854 --> 20:06.857
I will now give you
a quick demo

20:06.901 --> 20:09.077
of the two most common...

20:10.644 --> 20:12.602
...cane techniques.

20:13.951 --> 20:15.605
Sweeping.

20:17.390 --> 20:19.305
And tapping.

20:19.348 --> 20:20.828
Whoa!

20:23.657 --> 20:27.661
See? This cane saves lives.

20:27.704 --> 20:29.532
I got a question.

20:29.576 --> 20:32.535
Well, we're not really
at the question part.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.233
Do you dream?

20:34.276 --> 20:36.539
What?

20:36.583 --> 20:40.587
Well, I was just wondering if
a dude like you can have dreams.

20:40.630 --> 20:43.894
That's a very w-woke question.

20:43.938 --> 20:46.375
I dream all the time.

20:46.419 --> 20:48.769
Both when I'm asleep and awake.

20:48.812 --> 20:50.814
But if you're blind, like,

20:50.858 --> 20:53.077
can you see things
when you dream?

20:53.121 --> 20:56.777
Oh, uh, this is
a misunderstanding.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.431
I-I'm not actually...

20:58.474 --> 21:00.824
Dude, you're legit brave.

21:00.868 --> 21:04.132
[students murmuring]

21:12.358 --> 21:15.796
Thanks.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.277
You know, some days
are harder than others.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.496
But I truly believe

21:20.540 --> 21:24.935
that when life hands you lemons,

21:24.979 --> 21:27.111
well, you can't see them
because you're blind.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.549
[laughter]

21:30.550 --> 21:32.073
All right.

21:35.946 --> 21:37.948
Do you smell pot?

21:37.992 --> 21:39.863
[Pretzel panting]

21:42.997 --> 21:44.738
[coughing]

21:44.781 --> 21:46.087
Hello?

21:46.130 --> 21:48.829
Can we help you
with something?

21:48.872 --> 21:51.266
Do you know a girl
named Keira Shields?

21:51.310 --> 21:52.746
What's it to you?

21:52.789 --> 21:55.531
Yeah, are you, like,
a cop or something?

21:55.575 --> 21:58.447
Uh, yeah, I'm a cop.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.449
Yeah, the Chicago
Police Department is hiring

22:00.493 --> 22:02.712
a bunch of blind girls
to protect the streets.

22:02.756 --> 22:04.584
They'd probably
do a better job.

22:10.851 --> 22:11.982
Can I have a hit of that?

22:13.244 --> 22:14.289
[chuckling]

22:20.077 --> 22:22.297
So you ditched the assembly
you were supposed to lead?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.951
That is badass.It's just some lame
talking points

22:23.994 --> 22:25.648
about what it's like
to be blind.

22:25.692 --> 22:27.650
[laughs]Super accurate.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.174
[laughs]

22:30.218 --> 22:31.872
What's it like?

22:31.915 --> 22:33.569
Boring.

22:33.613 --> 22:36.267
And annoying.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.966
Imagine if you could only judge
people by their personalities.

22:39.009 --> 22:40.576
I wouldn't like anyone.

22:40.620 --> 22:43.623
Ding, ding, ding.
[chuckles]

22:43.666 --> 22:45.625
Is it hard to date?

22:48.628 --> 22:51.108
I don't know. I don't do it.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.023
Ever?

22:53.067 --> 22:55.286
Nah, it's not really my thing.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.637
I'm just gonna have a bunch
of meaningless sex until I die.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.421
[laughter]

22:59.465 --> 23:01.597
So you really
can't see?

23:01.641 --> 23:02.642
Like, if I go like this...

23:04.513 --> 23:06.385
You can't see me?

23:06.428 --> 23:08.343
Nope.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.780
Do you remember
what you look like?

23:12.826 --> 23:15.132
I don't think anyone's
ever asked me that.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.748
No, I-I don't.

23:21.791 --> 23:25.229
You don't know
what you look like?

23:25.273 --> 23:26.622
Mm-mm.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.276
[gasps softly]

23:29.625 --> 23:31.322
I think about what I look like

23:31.366 --> 23:32.541
about a thousand times a day.

23:32.585 --> 23:34.413
[laughter]

23:37.503 --> 23:39.722
Come here.

23:42.246 --> 23:46.468
Stand... here.

23:49.515 --> 23:51.821
You're standing in
front of the mirror.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.041
We're gonna tell you
what you look like.

23:55.390 --> 23:57.697
I'm obsessed
with your hair.

23:57.740 --> 24:01.701
It's blondish
and really thick.

24:01.744 --> 24:05.139
Thanks. I washed it yesterday.

24:05.182 --> 24:09.796
And your eyes are green
and super sexual.

24:09.839 --> 24:12.146
I have sexual eyes?

24:12.189 --> 24:13.669
[laughs]

24:13.713 --> 24:15.497
You're seriously
so pretty.

24:15.541 --> 24:17.717
Okay. Yep, we're done.

24:19.283 --> 24:21.547
[sighs]

24:21.590 --> 24:23.070
So, you guys friends with Keira?

24:23.113 --> 24:24.506
I heard she goes here.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.290
Yeah, she's our girl,
but she's been

24:26.334 --> 24:27.683
out of school for,
like, a week.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.119
Wait, she's not at school?

24:29.163 --> 24:30.512
Since her boyfriend ghosted,

24:30.556 --> 24:31.992
she's been mad depressed.

24:33.297 --> 24:34.734
[sighs]

24:37.432 --> 24:39.042
[door opens]

24:39.086 --> 24:41.958
What's going on here?
Is that weed?

24:42.002 --> 24:43.960
Uh...Uh... it's mine.

24:44.004 --> 24:46.310
Uh, these nice girls

24:46.354 --> 24:48.487
told me that smoking's
super bad for me

24:48.530 --> 24:50.837
and my brain.

24:50.880 --> 24:53.535
But I refused to listen
because I'm dumb.

24:53.579 --> 24:54.971
From all the pot.

24:55.015 --> 24:56.669
And who are you?

24:56.712 --> 24:58.540
Murphy. Hello.

24:58.584 --> 25:02.501
Yeah, I'm-I'm, uh, sort of
in charge of the assembly.

25:02.544 --> 25:04.415
And the assembly is where you
two girls are supposed to be.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.505
Okay, okay, we're going.

25:06.548 --> 25:08.419
Hey, tell Keira
I'm looking for her.

25:08.463 --> 25:09.986
It's about Tyson.

25:10.030 --> 25:10.987
Have her call me.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.165
[door opens]

25:15.209 --> 25:17.646
So you gonna give me
detention now or what?

25:17.690 --> 25:20.519
I have to pretend like I care
about stupid stuff

25:20.562 --> 25:22.564
like pot-smoking
in front of the students.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.348
Mm.

25:25.654 --> 25:29.092
Do you... have a boyfriend?

25:31.617 --> 25:34.141
I do not.

25:36.752 --> 25:38.667
[moaning softly]

25:45.544 --> 25:47.676
It was like a curtain closed.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.765
But you know what's weird?

25:49.809 --> 25:53.073
Even though I lost my sight,

25:53.116 --> 25:55.945
I feel like
I gained so much more.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.266

Oh.Here. No, over here.

26:22.493 --> 26:25.279

Oh. Oh.

over intercom]

26:34.201 --> 26:35.463
Is that Mr. Robbins?

Get it, Robbins.

26:49.695 --> 26:50.652
Here, here.Okay.

She is my hero.

Okay, guys,

26:56.702 --> 26:58.921
I know what we just saw
was a lot,

26:58.965 --> 27:00.836
but let's just try
to get back to, uh...

27:00.880 --> 27:02.664
I thought you couldn't see.

27:05.972 --> 27:07.538
Are you not blind?

27:07.582 --> 27:09.889
["All the Small Things"
by Blink-182 playing]

27:11.891 --> 27:13.893
You were lying?

27:13.936 --> 27:15.895
About being blind?

27:17.810 --> 27:19.289
No?

that's a punishment.

27:41.747 --> 27:43.357
Well, what was the
plan, by the way?

27:43.400 --> 27:45.794
Just bring me here and
watch me get humiliated?

your idea of fun?

get me to stop yelling at you...It's not.

to go under one of these.

Under the bleachers.

Where the burnouts hang out.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.457
What were you like
in high school?

29:23.500 --> 29:26.025
Oh, I... I didn't go.

29:26.068 --> 29:27.809
I just lost my sight.

29:27.853 --> 29:30.159
My mom thought
I couldn't handle it, so...

29:30.203 --> 29:31.944
She homeschooled me.

29:31.987 --> 29:34.598
And you thought your high school
experience was bad.

29:34.642 --> 29:37.297
The only thing worse than
being tortured in high school

29:37.340 --> 29:41.083
is returning as a grown man
and being tortured again.

29:42.998 --> 29:45.131

who tortures you on the reg...

29:45.174 --> 29:46.610

29:50.223 --> 29:51.920
Well, how?

29:51.964 --> 29:54.618
First of all, stop letting
the water guy bully you.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.272
I don't get bullied
by the water guy.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.013
Okay.

29:59.841 --> 30:01.582
Okay, fine.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.802
I do get bullied
by the water guy.

30:07.762 --> 30:11.548
Did you really masturbate
to the Blink-182 album cover?

30:14.203 --> 30:16.640
It was Shania Twain.

Hey, I-I looked up instructions
on how to put in a tampon.

30:35.355 --> 30:37.313
I'm just gonna go ahead
and read them, okay?

Dad, seriously? No."Number one:

30:40.795 --> 30:42.797

good advice, tight?

Stand in a...

prefer to squat,"

30:52.894 --> 30:57.159
so are you squatting
or... standing up?

30:57.203 --> 31:00.380
Dad, could you call Murphy?

31:00.423 --> 31:03.818
[sighs] Are you sure?
I-I could just call Grandma.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.908
Like Grandma
still has her period.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.954
Dad, just call Murphy.

31:11.739 --> 31:13.915
[whispering]:
Call Murphy.

31:13.959 --> 31:16.222
I'm dizzy. I feel
like I'm dying.

31:16.265 --> 31:18.615
These things are horrible.Yeah, you get used to it.

school make you feel bad, okay?

are nothing.

God, I wish they
had made fun of me.

31:46.382 --> 31:51.257
They were all super nice,
which was way worse.

31:51.300 --> 31:54.782
One girl even gave me her jacket
to put around my waist.

31:54.825 --> 31:58.046
Wait. [scoffs]
Wait, that's why you're bummed?

31:58.090 --> 31:59.743
You want someone
to make fun of you?

31:59.787 --> 32:01.963
Yeah.

this menstruating dork.

are shedding their lining.

has a vagina and everything.

Yeah.

You need help?

32:32.776 --> 32:34.691
Uh, no, I'm good.

32:34.735 --> 32:36.824
Thanks, Murphy.

32:36.867 --> 32:38.173
Of course, you bleeding loser.

Well, hey, if you want to, um,
call me at the office tomorrow,

he left and totally ghosted me.

I don't think that's
what happened.

34:39.555 --> 34:40.861
I think he was in trouble.

34:40.904 --> 34:43.603
Okay, so do you know
if anyone was after him?

34:43.646 --> 34:46.084
He was not in trouble.
He was cheating on me.

34:46.127 --> 34:47.868
What?I caught Tyson

34:47.911 --> 34:49.652
messaging some chick
named Jamie,

34:49.696 --> 34:51.480

and a girl answered.

wouldn't do that.

but you didn't. No one did.

35:03.840 --> 35:07.583
What-what else do you know
about this Jamie?

35:07.627 --> 35:09.063
Only that she lives in Madison.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.109
He snuck out a couple times
to go see her.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.416
Madison.
Yeah.

35:14.460 --> 35:16.723

with her right now.
