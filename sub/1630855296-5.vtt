WEBVTT

00:06.131 --> 00:08.133
[upbeat music playing]

00:12.887 --> 00:16.224
[McEnroe] It had been a week
since Devi had broken up with Ethan,

00:16.307 --> 00:19.394
and she couldn't believe
she'd almost let that gorgeous dimwit

00:19.477 --> 00:20.812
screw up her future.

00:21.396 --> 00:25.066
But now, she was finally headed
on Ms. Warner's New York trip

00:25.150 --> 00:28.862
where she'd actually get a glimpse
of what that future might be.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.989
You guys, I am so pumped.

00:31.072 --> 00:33.450
I can't believe
we're about to see our dream schools.

00:33.533 --> 00:36.077
Me at Princeton, El at Juilliard, Fab at--

00:36.161 --> 00:39.497
Fab, you said your mom made you apply
to an Ivy, but you never said which one.

00:39.581 --> 00:42.667
[McEnroe] If Fabiola looks like
she's about to shit a brick,

00:42.751 --> 00:44.127
it's 'cause you may remember

00:44.210 --> 00:46.755
she applied
to a certain friend's dream college

00:46.838 --> 00:48.840
behind a certain friend's back.

00:48.923 --> 00:51.468
Fab, are your compression socks
too compressed?

00:51.551 --> 00:53.344
Nope. Uh, it's just that…

00:55.305 --> 00:56.431
I did apply somewhere.

00:56.514 --> 00:59.267
I just don't think
that you would be too happy about it.

00:59.350 --> 01:01.102
Me? Fab, are you crazy?

01:01.186 --> 01:03.104
I'd be happy for you
wherever you decide to apply.

01:03.688 --> 01:05.774
-Unless you steal my spot at Princeton.
-[laughs]

01:05.857 --> 01:07.192
[exaggerated laugh]

01:07.275 --> 01:09.861
Never. No, I-- I applied to Yale.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.946
That's amazing. Why wouldn't I like that?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.866
Uh, because of how Connecticut is spelled.

01:14.949 --> 01:15.909
You're right.

01:15.992 --> 01:17.494
What is up with that silent "C?"

01:17.577 --> 01:20.914
Ooh, you should try to abscond
up to New Haven during our trip to see it.

01:20.997 --> 01:22.916
Yep, that would be very helpful for me.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.376
Wow, you guys,
I can't believe we're basically gonna see

01:25.460 --> 01:27.378
exactly how our lives are gonna be
next year.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.672
-Hah. Hmm.
-Oh. Um…

01:30.215 --> 01:33.927
Devi, would you mind not reclining?
I'm about to start some chair yoga.

01:34.552 --> 01:36.012
Okay. Okay.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.514
[electronic music playing]

01:44.729 --> 01:48.691
To quote our greatest
American songwriter, Taylor Swift,

01:48.775 --> 01:50.401
"Welcome to New York."

01:51.152 --> 01:53.446
More specifically,
just west of Hell's Kitchen,

01:53.530 --> 01:56.533
also known as "Hell's Toilet."
So welcome to that.

01:56.616 --> 01:59.744
During this trip,
we will be taking tours as big groups,

01:59.828 --> 02:03.164
but, uh, today, we have a few exceptions.
Mr. Shapiro?

02:03.248 --> 02:07.836
First off, our very own Eleanor Wong
has her audition at Juilliard.

02:09.546 --> 02:12.423
Happy to respect your process.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.717
Also, uh, Ben Gross,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.804
your father has organized
a private tour of Columbia.

02:17.887 --> 02:21.975
Oh, it's his client, Jerry Seinfeld,
has a nephew who goes there. [chuckles]

02:22.058 --> 02:25.186
You know, we are taking the entire group
to Columbia later this week.

02:25.770 --> 02:26.604
No, thanks.

02:26.688 --> 02:30.608
Okay. And, uh, Devi,
you also have a special trip planned--

02:30.692 --> 02:33.945
To Princeton, sweeties.
Don't hate me 'cause you ain't me.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.864
-That's not why everyone hates you.
-Okay. Hush.

02:35.947 --> 02:38.491
You're just jealous that you're
hanging out with some nepotism nerd

02:38.575 --> 02:41.411
while I'm spending the night
with Sherman Oaks icon, Blair Quan.

02:41.494 --> 02:43.121
[McEnroe] When Devi was a freshman,

02:43.204 --> 02:46.833
Blair Quan was the top senior student
at Sherman Oaks High.

02:46.916 --> 02:48.877
Not only was she valedictorian,

02:48.960 --> 02:52.630
but she had been an extracurricular beast
who had gotten into Princeton early.

02:52.714 --> 02:55.425
All right, people, there better not be
any typos in this week's issue.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.428
I do not accept
anything less than perfection.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.763
If you can't handle the pressure,
then go back to yearbook.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.559
[McEnroe] Devi was determined to follow
in her smart-as-hell footsteps.

03:04.642 --> 03:08.354
Well, later, losers. I have a date
with destiny in the Garden State.

03:08.438 --> 03:09.522
Oh, that reminds me.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.358
Fabiola, shouldn't you accompany Devi
to Princeton since--

03:12.442 --> 03:14.319
She needs protection on the train?

03:14.402 --> 03:16.070
I'm actually not very strong.

03:16.154 --> 03:20.575
People confuse my tallness for muscle,
but my bones are basically just crackers.

03:21.159 --> 03:24.495
Are we done? I know some people are
itching to see what a suburb looks like,

03:24.579 --> 03:27.373
but I have to take the number 1 train
uptown to 116th Street--

03:27.457 --> 03:30.460
-It's very complicated.
-Okay, Google Maps, no one gives a shit.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.171
Can it, you two.
All right, let's all head out.

03:33.254 --> 03:34.631
All right, everyone, NYU, this way.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.090
[McEnroe] Yeah, so as you can see,

03:36.174 --> 03:39.344
despite Devi having saved his ass
at the college fair,

03:39.427 --> 03:41.137
these two had definitely not made up.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.097
[indistinct chatter]

03:45.516 --> 03:46.434
[door closes]

03:46.517 --> 03:50.146
Oh great, I caught you. I was hoping
to talk to you about something.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.814
Oh. Of course. What is it?

03:51.898 --> 03:54.067
So you know how Pati abandoned me
after my eye surgery

03:54.150 --> 03:55.360
and went to the grocery store--

03:55.443 --> 03:58.196
And she got on the 210 going
the wrong way, ended up in Joshua Tree.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.739
-Right. [inhales]
-[Nalini] Yeah.

03:59.822 --> 04:04.410
Well… I'm pretty sure Len brought a woman
into the house while I was napping.

04:04.994 --> 04:05.995
-What?
-Yeah.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.748
-I could've sworn I heard a voice.
-What did she sound like?

04:09.332 --> 04:12.085
I wanna say… Kylie Minogue.

04:12.168 --> 04:13.670
Mmm.

04:14.545 --> 04:17.882
Kamala, you had a lot of Valium that day.
You think you might be mistaken?

04:17.966 --> 04:20.176
[sighs] I guess so.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.846
I did also think that I saw a penguin
sitting next to me at one point.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.473
Yep, it was probably the narcotics.

04:25.556 --> 04:26.391
Correct.

04:26.474 --> 04:29.185
Okay, now I need to head to work
so I can get home right away.

04:29.269 --> 04:33.856
This weekend, I have the house to myself
for the first time in 17 years,

04:33.940 --> 04:36.109
and it is going to be amazing.

04:36.192 --> 04:38.653
-[Andres laughs]
-[Nalini] Is something funny?

04:38.736 --> 04:41.864
Uh-- No, just good luck with that.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.242
It's hard to be alone
when you're not used to it.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.827
Doesn't sound hard to me.

04:46.452 --> 04:48.746
I once lost my hearing
in a SoulCycle class,

04:48.830 --> 04:50.081
best Saturday of my entire life.

04:50.665 --> 04:52.500
Okay. Bye-bye, everyone.

04:52.583 --> 04:54.711
[pleasant music playing]

04:57.880 --> 05:00.258
Holy shit, Princeton is so beautiful.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.052
It's basically a bunch of Downton Abbeys
sitting next to one another.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.221
-So what you guys up to?
-Oh, we're at Juilliard.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.889
I'm giving El space so she can prepare.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.308
She's about…

05:09.100 --> 05:11.227
Brown cow.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.895
…halfway through her vocal exercises.

05:12.979 --> 05:14.230
Sure, sure, fair enough.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.357
[girl gasps] Devi?

05:16.941 --> 05:20.695
[McEnroe] There she was,
the myth, the legend, Blair Quan.

05:20.778 --> 05:22.947
Blair, hi. Fab, I gotta go.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.951
Hi! Oh, I'm so excited to see my mini-me.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.163
[McEnroe] Whoa, Devi,
she just said you guys were alike.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.498
So, um, I already checked into admissions.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.876
Said "what up" to Akshara.
So what should we do next?

05:34.959 --> 05:37.420
Maybe we could do a tour,
or we could go to one of your classes?

05:37.503 --> 05:39.464
Why don't we get
to that boring stuff later

05:39.547 --> 05:41.883
and start with something fun first?

05:41.966 --> 05:44.635
Welcome to the Armstrong Inn.

05:44.719 --> 05:46.220
It's the eating club I belong to.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.015
Why don't we go put your stuff down,
and I'll show you around?

05:49.098 --> 05:50.558
And then we can hit up a class after.

05:50.641 --> 05:51.809
[McEnroe] Holy shit, Devi.

05:51.893 --> 05:56.064
A members-only club
in a historic-ass mansion.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.359
Who are you? The horse-loving daughter
of a tech billionaire?

06:01.444 --> 06:03.988
-[boy] …she wakes.
-[man] Great job.

06:04.072 --> 06:05.907
[applause]

06:05.990 --> 06:07.241
Nicely done, young man.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.369
[boy] Thank you, again.

06:11.871 --> 06:12.830
Eleanor Wong.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.499
Hi, yes, that's me.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.214
[door closes]

06:21.297 --> 06:23.841
So, Fabiola, you wanna tell me
why you were so weird

06:23.925 --> 06:26.052
about visiting Princeton with Devi?

06:26.135 --> 06:29.889
Was I weird?
I distinctly remember being very chill.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.891
Have you not told Devi
that you've applied?

06:31.974 --> 06:33.393
You know you have to, right?

06:33.476 --> 06:37.522
I thought I'd just wait until she gets in,
and then it would be like, "Surprise!"

06:37.605 --> 06:40.858
You are physically
on the East Coast right now.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.568
You need to go to that school.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.071
[Fabiola] But I'm not even sure
I should have applied there.

06:45.154 --> 06:47.407
And have you seen Devi
when she gets upset?

06:47.490 --> 06:49.242
She makes the Hulk look like Kermit.

06:49.325 --> 06:52.495
Oh, I'm aware of your friend's temper.
That's why I have a helmet in my office.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.997
But you need to prioritize yourself

06:55.081 --> 06:57.291
and go see if that school
is right for you.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.379
You have never known what happiness was.

07:02.213 --> 07:04.590
But wait, Uncle Vanya,

07:05.299 --> 07:06.884
please wait. [inhales sharply]

07:08.636 --> 07:10.096
We shall rest.

07:11.055 --> 07:13.349
We shall rest. We shall rest.

07:17.687 --> 07:18.563
[exhales]

07:18.646 --> 07:19.480
And, scene.

07:20.064 --> 07:22.525
Well, thank you, Miss Wong.
We appreciate you coming in today.

07:23.901 --> 07:24.735
Oh. [chuckles]

07:24.819 --> 07:25.653
Of course.

07:27.697 --> 07:28.614
[paper flipping]

07:29.699 --> 07:32.577
Um, so you guys didn't clap.

07:33.119 --> 07:33.953
Excuse me?

07:34.036 --> 07:37.123
I… I heard you clap
for the other guy before.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.541
The kid who did Othello.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.377
Oh, well, every performance is different.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.048
I don't have a chance, do I?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.759
Miss Wong, I assure you,
we have not made any decisions yet.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.970
But you have though, right?

07:51.053 --> 07:53.723
You can give it to me straight.
I can take it.

07:55.558 --> 07:56.767
If I'm being honest,

07:57.643 --> 08:00.104
I'm not sure Juilliard
is the right place for you.

08:00.188 --> 08:02.398
But there are so many ways to be an actor.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.317
Look at Flo from Progressive.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.027
I bet she's got a second home.

08:06.694 --> 08:07.653
Oh. [chuckles]

08:08.905 --> 08:12.325
[man] I promise, you will find your path.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.452
Thank you.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.329
[somber music playing]

08:20.249 --> 08:21.334
[exhales]

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380
Hey, everyone. This is Ben.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.008
He's applying early
and wants to see what life is like here,

08:29.091 --> 08:30.384
so don't embarrass me.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.802
Can't make any promises.

08:31.886 --> 08:32.845
[students chuckling]

08:32.929 --> 08:35.223
Oh, hey, we were talking about
that article in The Atlantic

08:35.306 --> 08:38.684
on, uh, dark money lobby regulations.
You guys wanna sit?

08:38.768 --> 08:41.103
[McEnroe] In high school,
Ben's social circle

08:41.187 --> 08:44.190
had included zero friends and one nemesis.

08:44.273 --> 08:46.484
He was hoping college would change that.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.236
Yeah, I mean, it's a complete farce.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.738
Basically, Big Oil's writing
all of our laws at this point.

08:51.906 --> 08:55.117
Totally. It does seem like a lot of
automakers are turning to electric though,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.452
so that's good.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.746
Well, Ben, you know electric cars
are just as bad, right?

08:58.829 --> 09:01.207
I mean, heavy-metal mining
is a serious human rights issue.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.959
Without a clean grid,
what's even the point?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.544
Right, right, yeah.

09:04.627 --> 09:06.003
I… I just mean hopefully one day,

09:06.087 --> 09:08.589
we can just, like,
run cars on corn. [laughs]

09:08.673 --> 09:10.424
Yeah, come on, Ben.

09:10.508 --> 09:13.302
We certainly don't wanna incentivize
monoculture farming

09:13.386 --> 09:14.679
any more than we already do.

09:14.762 --> 09:15.888
No. No…

09:15.972 --> 09:17.598
[scoffs] Of course not. [chuckles]

09:17.682 --> 09:19.475
Do you guys wanna order some food?

09:19.559 --> 09:21.936
Ben, you're our guest.
What are you in the mood for?

09:23.688 --> 09:24.981
Food?

09:25.815 --> 09:29.735
Uh, I just want something that's
sustainably sourced, carbon-neutral,

09:29.819 --> 09:32.572
and preferably delivered
by someone who's paid a living wage.

09:32.655 --> 09:33.990
Dude, relax. [chuckles]

09:34.073 --> 09:35.700
Uh, are we feeling pizza?

09:36.284 --> 09:37.743
-[boy 1] Yeah.
-[boy 2] Pizza's good.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.872
[laughing] Oh my God, Devi,
you are gonna love college.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.125
Back home, my mom
was always on my ass to study,

09:44.208 --> 09:45.918
and she never let me talk to boys.

09:46.002 --> 09:49.672
But here, believe me, a girl's doing more
than just talking to boys.

09:49.755 --> 09:52.133
Whoa. That's the coolest freaking thing
I've ever heard.

09:52.216 --> 09:53.467
Yeah, it's awesome.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.761
No strict moms cramping your style,

09:55.845 --> 09:58.097
throwing away any thongs
she finds in the laundry.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.599
My mom did that too.

09:59.682 --> 10:01.767
I lied to her and told her
it was one of my headbands,

10:01.851 --> 10:03.477
and she made me wear one to Olive Garden.

10:03.561 --> 10:04.895
-[upbeat song plays]
-[laughs] Oh.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.731
My dining club's party is starting.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.566
What do you say, shall we?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.151
Hell yeah.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.611
[McEnroe] Devi was in awe.

10:11.694 --> 10:13.404
The Blair she knew in high school

10:13.487 --> 10:17.325
had skipped prom to practice
extra declensions for AP Latin.

10:17.867 --> 10:19.869
Hey, guys. How are we doing?

10:19.952 --> 10:21.954
How's everything going over here?
Oh my God…

10:22.038 --> 10:23.205
[McEnroe] Now look at her.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.500
She was mixing and mingling
even more than "Jingle Bell Rock."

10:26.584 --> 10:28.878
-Y'all look good. Let's party.
-Okay.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.504
[song continues]

10:31.797 --> 10:35.217
All right, who wants shots?

10:35.301 --> 10:37.720
[all cheering]

10:38.763 --> 10:40.640
I freaking love my future life.

10:44.685 --> 10:45.853
Hello, I'm ho--

10:50.608 --> 10:51.942
[exhales]

10:53.069 --> 10:54.945
Sweet silence.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.577
-[crickets chirping]
-[clock ticking]

11:03.037 --> 11:03.996
[exhales]

11:12.088 --> 11:14.715
[owl hooting]

11:16.884 --> 11:19.387
[ticking]

11:21.263 --> 11:22.473
[sighs]

11:26.060 --> 11:27.269
[Fabiola] Ben?

11:27.353 --> 11:30.606
Thought you'd still be up at Columbia
hanging out with your fancy new friends.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.818
Yeah, no.
It was super fun, and I totally fit in,

11:33.901 --> 11:35.820
but, uh, I just came back to recharge,

11:35.903 --> 11:39.323
especially after so much
intellectually stimulating conversation.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.200
Okay, kids, here's the thing.

11:41.283 --> 11:45.287
We were unable to get all of you tickets
to a Broadway show.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.916
However, we did get ourselves
two tickets to Moulin Rouge!

11:48.999 --> 11:49.834
[laughs]

11:49.917 --> 11:52.169
But for you guys, we have pre-ordered

11:52.253 --> 11:53.879
-the film version…
-Film version.

11:53.963 --> 11:55.172
-…to this room.
-This room.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.383
So you can follow along with us.
It's gonna be fun.

11:57.466 --> 11:58.968
Watch it. [chuckles]

11:59.552 --> 12:02.221
-Hmm. We should go--
-Okay, bye. Yeah…

12:02.304 --> 12:04.473
-[Ms. Warner] Because, yeah, we gotta…
-Ugh!

12:04.557 --> 12:08.227
El, are you okay? You haven't said a word
since your audition.

12:08.310 --> 12:10.730
-I don't wanna talk about it.
-[Fabiola] Okay.

12:10.813 --> 12:12.773
Maybe I'll see what Devi's doing.

12:14.233 --> 12:15.693
How was your class visit?

12:15.776 --> 12:18.154
Did the student-teacher ratio seem cool?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.156
-[dance music playing]
-Yes!

12:20.239 --> 12:23.242
Oh, hit it. Yes, girl.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.577
Whoo!

12:25.494 --> 12:26.495
[Devi] Didn't go to class,

12:26.579 --> 12:28.831
but am getting "schooled"
on how to party by Blair

12:28.914 --> 12:30.958
at her ritzy AF Armstrong Inn.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.251
You would love it here.

12:34.003 --> 12:35.921
[McEnroe] But would she love it there?

12:36.756 --> 12:40.634
She only applied to please her mom
and maybe see a BB-8 droid.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.720
She knew she needed to visit.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.013
Why don't we meet up with Devi?

12:44.096 --> 12:46.307
She's at a fun party,
and that could cheer you up.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.601
Who knows? Maybe we'll learn
some factoids about Princeton

12:48.684 --> 12:50.478
that could be useful for someone.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.563
What about the chaperones?

12:52.646 --> 12:55.733
Those autograph hounds
will be waiting outside the stage door

12:55.816 --> 12:58.277
for hours after curtain call. We got time.

12:58.903 --> 13:03.991
Well… honestly,
I could probably use a stiff drink

13:04.074 --> 13:06.911
since this trip has shattered
my entire sense of self.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.746
Yeah, I could use a drink too.

13:09.622 --> 13:14.168
But mine is to celebrate
because today went really well for me.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.004
Can I come?

13:17.087 --> 13:20.299
Yes. Come on. Let's go. Come on.

13:21.008 --> 13:22.218
[dance music playing]

13:22.301 --> 13:24.762
Hey. I'm Seth. What's your name?

13:24.845 --> 13:27.097
-It's Devi.
-Back off, Seth, she's in high school.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.475
-Throwing it in reverse.
-[Blair] Whoo!

13:29.558 --> 13:32.561
Blair, this is so friggin' fun.
Your life is so dope.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.063
I wanna be exactly like you.

13:34.146 --> 13:36.982
Quan, what the hell are you doing?
You're supposed to stay behind the bar.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.734
You're not even wearing your uniform.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.277
I'm so sorry, Mr. Martel.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.987
I just thought I'd be creative

13:42.071 --> 13:44.073
to take the drinks
to the guests on the dance floor.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.699
Listen, you're fired. Let's go.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.160
No, please. I really need this job.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.537
W-W-Wait, you work here?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.332
Do all of the students in this club
have to do a shift? Like a co-op?

13:53.415 --> 13:56.377
Yeah, so, um, the thing is,

13:57.336 --> 13:58.712
I'm actually not a student anymore.

13:58.796 --> 14:00.673
[whimsical music playing]

14:05.469 --> 14:07.054
-[knocking on door]
-Oh.

14:07.680 --> 14:08.931
-[Andres] Hey.
-Oh, hello.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.267
I'm so sorry to interrupt
your special night of alone time,

14:11.350 --> 14:13.018
but I think I left my phone
in your kitchen.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.229
Oh my goodness.
Yes, come on in. Of course.

14:15.312 --> 14:18.774
-Yes, no, no, come in, come in.
-All right, let's see. Um…

14:18.858 --> 14:21.026
-Ah! Found it.
-Oh, that was very fast.

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
I was really worried I sealed it up
in one of your walls.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.446
[both laugh]

14:24.530 --> 14:26.156
I'll let you get back to your you time.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.368
Oh! Wait, wait,
no need to jet out of here.

14:29.451 --> 14:32.288
Just tell me about your day
or any other day for that matter.

14:32.371 --> 14:34.206
Just talk, whatever you want.
You can just talk.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.209
-Quiet's getting to ya, huh?
-It's deafening.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.337
Did you know your bath
only stays warm for, like, five minutes,

14:40.421 --> 14:42.590
and then you're just sitting
in your own personal pond?

14:42.673 --> 14:43.924
[chuckles]

14:44.008 --> 14:46.302
Do you have anywhere else to be,
or can you…?

14:46.385 --> 14:49.096
Well, actually,
Margot is at a friend's house.

14:49.847 --> 14:51.140
You can stay?

14:51.223 --> 14:52.683
[Nalini] Oh my God, thank God.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.894
Okay, uh, well, what should we do?

14:54.977 --> 14:57.438
Uh, did you wanna play,
uh, like, a board game or--

14:57.521 --> 14:58.606
Have you had dinner?

14:58.689 --> 15:00.566
Does eating a sleeve of saltines

15:00.649 --> 15:02.860
while solving
a thousand-piece puzzle count?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.071
I'm so sorry, Devi.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.115
I didn't wanna lie to you.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.243
This is just obviously
kind of humiliating for me.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.287
So, what happened?

15:13.370 --> 15:16.874
Well, it turns out if you party nonstop
and fail all your classes,

15:16.957 --> 15:18.167
they will not let you stay.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.337
But you were
the most focused person I knew.

15:21.420 --> 15:24.924
How do you go to college
and then just decide to stop trying?

15:25.799 --> 15:28.844
I don't know, Devi.
I was so burnt out after high school.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.179
I mean, you know what it's like.

15:30.262 --> 15:34.433
You do a million extracurriculars,
and you take all the hardest classes

15:34.516 --> 15:36.435
just to get into a school like this.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.396
Then once you're in, what's the goal?

15:39.480 --> 15:41.607
You're certainly not gonna be
the top anymore,

15:41.690 --> 15:43.776
and you don't have your mom here
to badger you.

15:44.276 --> 15:46.779
-It's easy to get lost.
-Damn.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.990
The hardest part about college
isn't the schoolwork.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.202
It's being on your own
and not knowing who the hell you are.

15:54.995 --> 15:56.956
So how are you doing now?

15:57.039 --> 15:57.915
I'm okay.

15:58.832 --> 16:02.461
I'm just trying to figure myself out
before I decide what to do next.

16:04.713 --> 16:07.132
Wait, hang on a sec.
Where was I gonna sleep tonight?

16:07.216 --> 16:09.927
I redecorated my apartment
to look like a dorm room,

16:10.010 --> 16:11.470
and paid my 50-year-old neighbor

16:11.553 --> 16:13.555
to wear a backwards hat
and ride a skateboard.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.307
-Nice.
-[both laugh]

16:18.185 --> 16:22.022
Uh, do you mind waiting here for a second?
I really need to beg for my job back.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.274
Yeah, for sure. Go get 'em, tiger.

16:24.358 --> 16:27.069
-Or, uh, former Tiger.
-[Blair chuckles]

16:27.152 --> 16:30.072
[McEnroe] Devi was shaken
by this revelation from her idol.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.616
If perfect Blair
couldn't hack it at college,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.284
then what chance did she have?

16:34.368 --> 16:37.037
It also reminded her
that maybe she'd underestimated

16:37.121 --> 16:39.873
how hard the transition
to college might be.

16:39.957 --> 16:41.667
Devi, is this a butt dial?

16:41.750 --> 16:43.669
No, I'm looking straight at you.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.212
But aren't you on a trip?

16:45.295 --> 16:46.880
Okay, stop asking questions.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.340
[chuckling] Sorry. Go on.

16:48.424 --> 16:53.429
I just wanted to say I'm really sorry
about giving you a hard time about ASU.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.972
Oh. Uh…

16:55.597 --> 16:56.432
It's all right.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.393
No, no, I was being a judgy brat,

16:59.476 --> 17:01.603
and I didn't know
what the hell I was talking about.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.481
Well, thanks, Devi. I appreciate that.

17:05.315 --> 17:09.611
Also, it's pretty nice to get to see
your face around school again.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.238
It's nice seeing you too.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.742
Is everything all right out there?

17:14.825 --> 17:16.452
Yeah, totally.

17:16.535 --> 17:20.998
It's just… things are a little different
than what I thought they'd be here.

17:21.081 --> 17:22.082
Yeah… [chuckles]

17:22.166 --> 17:24.835
That's, um, kind of how I felt
about college too.

17:25.669 --> 17:29.173
[Trent] Bro, what did I say about having
your phone out at best bro's dinner?

17:29.256 --> 17:31.050
Every Saturday and Sunday, you're mine.

17:31.133 --> 17:32.176
[Paxton] Coming.

17:32.259 --> 17:33.427
So I guess you gotta go?

17:33.510 --> 17:34.678
Yeah, I'm in trouble.

17:34.762 --> 17:38.098
But, um, thank you for the call.
Um, let's chill when you get back.

17:39.099 --> 17:40.434
Yeah. Bye, Paxton.

17:41.518 --> 17:44.605
Oh my God, guys, look, there's Devi!
See, we're at the right spot!

17:46.607 --> 17:48.942
-What are you doing here?
-We're here to see you.

17:49.026 --> 17:50.819
Aw. That's really nice.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.113
Can you take us to some alcohol, please?

17:53.197 --> 17:55.115
Uh-- Well, I could, but, um--

17:55.199 --> 17:57.743
Wait. How come you're sitting
outside the party with your suitcase?

17:57.826 --> 18:00.079
-You get kicked out for being a loser?
-Okay, Ben--

18:00.162 --> 18:01.914
Devi, I'm back. Come on in.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.957
Great. Uh, could I bring some friends?

18:04.041 --> 18:05.751
Oh, hey, guys. Come. Yeah.

18:05.834 --> 18:07.377
[happy music playing]

18:09.213 --> 18:12.091
So, what were you gonna do
if I hadn't shown up?

18:12.174 --> 18:13.467
Oh, I was dangerously close

18:13.550 --> 18:15.719
to disassembling the dishwasher
so I could deep clean it.

18:15.803 --> 18:16.845
That's dark.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.764
I guess you were right. [sighs]

18:18.847 --> 18:21.350
Being home alone is harder than I thought.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.519
Oh my goodness,
when Devi goes to college next year,

18:23.602 --> 18:24.812
what am I gonna do with myself?

18:24.895 --> 18:25.896
I get it.

18:25.979 --> 18:27.689
Margot went to art camp one summer,

18:27.773 --> 18:30.859
and I was so desperate to fill the time,
I built a pool house.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.904
-We don't have a pool.
-[laughing] That's a good one.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.155
[chuckles]

18:35.739 --> 18:38.909
I always imagined
I would spend this time with Mohan.

18:38.992 --> 18:42.579
I… I thought we would take on
some empty-nester hobbies, you know?

18:42.663 --> 18:45.415
Like… building a birdhouse.

18:45.499 --> 18:48.335
-Sure.
-Although Mohan hated crafts, so not that.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.920
How can anybody hate crafts?

18:50.003 --> 18:52.965
He used to say it was a poor substitute
for a personality.

18:53.048 --> 18:56.385
That is a very harsh indictment
of the crafting world.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.886
[laughing] I thought so.

18:58.762 --> 19:02.641
Listen, I… I know you didn't plan
to do this on your own.

19:02.724 --> 19:06.520
I certainly didn't either,
but, uh, we're gonna get through this.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.150
And if you're at all interested
in buying a recumbent bike…

19:11.233 --> 19:13.068
I kinda feel like that's where I'm headed.

19:13.152 --> 19:14.027
-No.
-[Andres] Yeah.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.904
No, no, no, Andres, absolutely not.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.073
That is way too sad dad.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.992
I'm actually gonna make a pot of tea.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.077
And when I come back,
we are going to think about

19:22.161 --> 19:24.454
more dignified hobbies for your old age.

19:25.998 --> 19:27.791
["I Want You Around"
by DAZZ & Zombic playing]

19:27.875 --> 19:29.835
What brings you to the boring-ass burbs?

19:29.918 --> 19:32.462
-Just morbid curiosity.
-[Devi] Real cool, bro.

19:33.046 --> 19:34.882
[Ben] All right, I'm gonna do a lap.

19:36.466 --> 19:39.344
All right, El, here's your Sazerac.
Tell us what happened today.

19:39.428 --> 19:41.054
Did something happen today?

19:42.472 --> 19:45.893

Are you close enough to her

Ben, Blair and I are basically
the same person. If she imploded--

You think you will too? Nah, you won't.

How do you know that? I'm not known
for being the most stable person around.

21:41.133 --> 21:44.469
Look, Devi, I know that you idolize Blair
and you think you're so similar,

21:44.553 --> 21:46.638

about the world,

that I'd never even heard of.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.947
You can read an article too.

They're probably just regurgitating words
that they read before

Well, the good news is
Seth was asked to leave.

he told everyone you're underage,

to touch Aaron Tveit's bare hand.
