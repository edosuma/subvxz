00:36.240 --> 00:40.192
Tales of monstrous,
man-eating anacondas

00:40.391 --> 00:44.343
have been told for centuries
by Amazon tribes.

00:44.543 --> 00:47.936
Some are said
to worship giant snakes.

00:48.136 --> 00:51.689
Anacondas are ferocious,
and enormous.

00:51.888 --> 00:54.842
They can grow up to 40 feet long.

00:55.042 --> 00:58.395
They do not merely eat their prey.

00:58.595 --> 01:01.908
They regurgitate it
in order to kill and eat again.

02:39.273 --> 02:43.464
Please, help! Somebody, help!

02:43.704 --> 02:50.211
This is an emergency.
Somebody, please!

03:15.999 --> 03:20.310
Please ...

04:36.358 --> 04:41.308
ARlAU JUNGLE HOTEL, BRAZlL
DEEP lN THE AMAZON

05:15.239 --> 05:20.509
- Miss Flores.
- Professor. When did you get in?

05:20.708 --> 05:25.978
A couple of days ago. l've been out
asking about our tribe.

05:26.138 --> 05:32.006
- Any luck?
- The evidence is they're out there.

05:32.205 --> 05:36.237
And can be found...
or so l told the grant people!

05:36.397 --> 05:41.587
My guide thinks they're here.
He found one of their markers.

05:41.786 --> 05:46.058
- That's good!
- l think we have a chance.

05:46.257 --> 05:50.728
- Get me there, and l'll shoot it.
- That's why I hired you.

05:50.928 --> 05:55.918
- l appreciate the work.
- l wanted the best director.

05:56.117 --> 05:59.431
I think we'll make a good team.

05:59.630 --> 06:02.285
You're a mess. What happened to you?

06:02.336 --> 06:07.446
Just a small piranha attack.
l barely escaped with my life.

06:23.622 --> 06:30.808
- Somebody's up awfully early.
- Well, today's a good day.

06:31.007 --> 06:36.197
Not every day my home girl
gets to direct a documentary.

06:36.357 --> 06:40.748
- You ready?
- l think so.

06:41.865 --> 06:45.618
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

06:46.895 --> 06:49.610
ls this a pleasure cruise?

06:49.711 --> 06:54.621
Come on... you know me.
l don't mix business with pleasure.

06:54.786 --> 06:57.761
Okay, what about...
if we go up through here?

06:58.392 --> 07:03.402
This way better.
lf not, l cannot be responsible.

07:04.700 --> 07:10.488
Well, it's only 55 kilometers more.
Better safe than sorry.

07:10.688 --> 07:14.909
- Mateo, you understand me?
- Sure.

07:15.119 --> 07:20.149
- l need some shots over there.
- As you say, cheffe.

07:21.130 --> 07:23.126
- For your approval.
- Thanks.

07:23.452 --> 07:28.322
- So, where's Westridge? He checked in.
- Probably getting his beauty sleep.

07:28.412 --> 07:30.009
Careful!

07:30.208 --> 07:35.238
Careful! Bordeaux!
Fragile. Expensive wine.

07:35.438 --> 07:40.707
- Good morning.
- Morning. How was your flight?

07:40.907 --> 07:44.899
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare.
Ongoing, l think.

07:46.096 --> 07:50.807
- One zoom lens ...
- You! Stow this in my room, will you.

07:51.007 --> 07:54.060
Excuse me...
l'm the production manager.

07:54.458 --> 07:57.452
Then so do you can manage
my things into my room!

07:58.653 --> 07:59.951
One pompous ass ...

08:00.041 --> 08:05.071
You know, in some cultures, that's a sign of
friendship respect shows for asking you to carry their bags.

08:05.098 --> 08:07.254
Respect this!

08:07.329 --> 08:09.185
Mr Westridge
Terri Flores.

08:09.279 --> 08:10.676
Terri, this is a pleasure.

08:11.605 --> 08:15.996
l've seen some of your films.
I thought they were... promising.

08:16.196 --> 08:20.627
- lt's hot! Are we on the equator?
- Welcome aboard... l guess.

08:20.759 --> 08:23.693
- I think he likes you!
- You felt that too?

08:25.457 --> 08:28.012
lt's Jacques Cousteau!

08:28.172 --> 08:34.140
- Joinez-moi avec mon equipe.
- Whatever the hell that means.

08:34.183 --> 08:35.580
Its good to see you man.

08:35.660 --> 08:38.296
Cheffe, ready for Rio Negro!

08:38.791 --> 08:44.499
Everybody! Check your gear and
pray you remembered bug spray.

09:02.064 --> 09:08.012
Our adventure begins 1,000 miles
from the mouth of the Amazon.

09:08.212 --> 09:13.122
From here, we travel
unexplored backwaters

09:13.321 --> 09:17.792
in search of the illusive...
People of the Mist, the Shirishama tribe.

09:17.822 --> 09:20.956
One of the last great
mysteries of the Rain Forest.

09:37.752 --> 09:41.904
ls it just me,
or does the jungle make you horny?

09:43.645 --> 09:49.114
- Oh no... l think it's the jungle.
- I'm serious, l've got one thing on my mind.

09:50.245 --> 09:52.960
Can l work, please?

10:06.974 --> 10:09.608
Help!

10:11.005 --> 10:15.117
Save me! l'm stranded.

10:15.317 --> 10:19.908
My boat is stranded in the ropes.
Help me!

10:24.167 --> 10:26.163
Check this out,
there's a dude on a boat over there.

10:26.599 --> 10:30.232
Hey! Pull over to his boat!

10:34.279 --> 10:38.031
We'll bring you on board.

10:44.418 --> 10:47.213
Thank the Lord for you!
Thanks the Lord.

10:48.512 --> 10:49.909
Are you hurt?

10:50.114 --> 10:55.303
- Are you okay?
- My propeller tore off in the roots.

10:55.814 --> 10:59.766
We can't take you back to Manaus.
We headed up river.

10:59.810 --> 11:05.000
At the next village, l know the
people. They help me fix my boat.

11:05.477 --> 11:10.008
- l apologize for the trouble.
- There's no need.

11:10.022 --> 11:15.192
We're all at the mercy of machines.
Yours broke.

11:15.236 --> 11:19.188
Mateo, vamonos.

11:40.341 --> 11:44.732
- Fish, river style!
- Not bad!

11:44.862 --> 11:47.457
We should get that on film next time.

11:52.222 --> 11:56.553
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr...?
- Sarone. Paul Sarone.

11:57.152 --> 12:00.945
- Where are you from, Mr. Sarone?
- Paraguay.

12:01.011 --> 12:03.646
- Really?
- l studied to be a priest.

12:05.176 --> 12:09.328
But then l needed
to see the real world.

12:09.527 --> 12:13.380
So l ended up in the jungle.
l seem to fit.

12:13.424 --> 12:17.096
So, what does a failed priest do in the jungle?

12:18.140 --> 12:23.330
Failed? Who says l failed?
l didn't fail.

12:23.345 --> 12:27.776
I'm sure you didn't.
So what is your calling now?

12:28.103 --> 12:30.099
- Snakes.
- Snakes?

12:30.695 --> 12:32.431
l catch them.

12:32.481 --> 12:34.437
For zoos and collectors.

12:34.525 --> 12:37.519
- Whatever they want
- Poaching?

12:38.669 --> 12:42.821
Poaching is illegal.
May I ask you... What are you hunting?

12:42.821 --> 12:45.455
We're not hunting or trapping anything.

12:45.615 --> 12:50.645
We're making a documentary
on the Shirishama lndians.

12:51.400 --> 12:54.993
- The People of the Mist? That's right
- You know of them?

12:55.047 --> 13:01.035
- l've seen them.
- Really... could you show me where?

13:01.334 --> 13:06.823
You saved my life. l can show you
exactly where l saw the Shirishama.

13:08.477 --> 13:13.467
So slurs every river rat after
five whiskies in any Manaus bar.

13:14.162 --> 13:17.655
Five whiskies?
That's breakfast on the river.

13:22.613 --> 13:25.607
Does salad go well
with fish river style?

13:26.145 --> 13:29.139
Salad would be perfect,
little baby bird.

13:52.140 --> 13:53.138
Look at that.

13:58.064 --> 13:59.062
Are they fireflies?

14:02.178 --> 14:07.168
Pretty, huh?
Family Lampyridae.

14:09.537 --> 14:14.028
They use their night flashes to
announce that they're ready to mate.

14:15.349 --> 14:20.339
- Who flashes? Males or females?
- Both, actually.

14:20.731 --> 14:24.723
The females with short,
dainty, feminine flashes...

14:26.500 --> 14:31.191
- and the males with long,
drawn-out, manly flashes.

14:34.146 --> 14:38.338
l like that. No pick-up lines,
no misunderstandings.

14:39.481 --> 14:41.078
Just instinct and nature.

14:48.856 --> 14:50.254
l've missed you.

15:55.089 --> 15:57.185
Bloody racket!

15:59.099 --> 16:04.089
Hey! Don't touch my radio!

16:12.136 --> 16:16.128
l could cheerfully hire someone
to kill you.

16:16.176 --> 16:23.062
- 15 dollars should cover it.
- l could just kill you for free.

16:23.147 --> 16:26.141
- You and whose army?
- Your mama's!

16:29.161 --> 16:31.157
So...are we getting close?

16:32.522 --> 16:36.514
- Just around this bend.
- Perfect.

16:57.021 --> 16:59.516
A snake totem pole.

17:02.603 --> 17:04.598
lt's the Shirishama's.

17:05.189 --> 17:09.480
Shirishama worship giant snakes.
Anacondas. As gods and protectors.

17:10.827 --> 17:14.220
They have a legend
of a journey to a sacred lake.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.010
First you pass a waterfall
but that could takes you by warrior snakes.

17:18.106 --> 17:22.098
Once you pass the guardian
Then you travel through the land of the Shirishama,

17:22.589 --> 17:27.579
- until you come to a wall so high,
it blots out the sky...

17:27.579 --> 17:32.570
Then after five days, you reach
the head of a giant anaconda.

17:34.817 --> 17:39.607
- You know the story.
- Of course, a beautiful legend...

17:39.675 --> 17:43.069
I believe... however its a legend of the Maku.

17:43.093 --> 17:46.487
- Also the Shirishama.
- Not to my knowledge.

17:47.004 --> 17:51.894
Their village was right here.
They're down this fork.

17:51.977 --> 17:56.967
- l know. l trap snakes, for living.
- And l'm sure you're good at it.

17:57.975 --> 18:00.969
l locate tribes for living.
l'm very good at that.

18:01.970 --> 18:07.858
The water level is high, so my calculation means
that the area at this side will be flooded.

18:07.947 --> 18:12.438
So our tribe would seek
higher ground over here.

18:14.069 --> 18:17.562
- Which way?
- This way.

18:18.957 --> 18:22.450
l want a shot of you with the totem.
Gary, roll sound.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.329
Camera rolling.
Action!

18:26.766 --> 18:30.558
Our first piece of luck:
a Shirishama idol.

18:31.679 --> 18:35.671
l know what l know.
Leave me at the next village.

18:37.222 --> 18:38.220
With pleasure.

18:40.398 --> 18:42.893
What the hell was that all about?

19:05.519 --> 19:09.112
- We'll go get some wild sound.
- Just be careful.

19:11.790 --> 19:12.788
See you guys.

19:29.929 --> 19:30.927
Gary...

19:54.722 --> 19:56.319
lt's unbelievable.

20:00.396 --> 20:03.390
- Gary ...
- What?

20:08.613 --> 20:09.911
Oh my God!

20:31.317 --> 20:32.315
Wait.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.037
Do you hear that?

20:38.155 --> 20:39.452
The silence.

21:03.891 --> 21:05.887
- What was that?
- l don't know.

21:11.231 --> 21:13.527
Mateo, shine the light over there.

21:24.593 --> 21:26.589
These two are fortunate to be alive.

21:27.875 --> 21:32.067
- What happened?
- You should have seen it!

21:32.141 --> 21:36.133
He just blasted this thing
coming right at us.

21:39.520 --> 21:45.508
Wild boar. Gores with his tusks.
Goes for the eyes.

21:45.859 --> 21:48.853
- Denise, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

21:49.849 --> 21:55.338
- Everybody stays on board at night.
- That's a smart idea.

21:59.119 --> 22:02.612
Mateo, let's cut him up.
Food for a week.

22:05.044 --> 22:06.442
Food?

22:30.100 --> 22:34.491
- My turn?
- lt's my turn.

22:46.489 --> 22:49.483
Mateo,
do you have control of this vessel?

22:49.714 --> 22:51.211
Lie, if you must.

22:54.576 --> 22:57.071
The rope's caught in the propeller.

23:06.109 --> 23:07.406
l'll cut us loose.

23:07.447 --> 23:11.938
Let me.
This river can kill you 1,000 ways.

23:12.765 --> 23:17.755
l can handle it. The only thing
l'm afraid of is the candiru acu.

23:20.338 --> 23:24.330
lt's a tiny little catfish.
lt swims up into your urethra

23:26.409 --> 23:30.401
- spreads its little spines
and refuses to budge.

23:31.104 --> 23:36.094
- You have to cut it out.
- That's it! l'm going back to L.A.

24:45.883 --> 24:48.478
Terri, something's wrong!

24:50.247 --> 24:51.245
Cale?

24:53.636 --> 24:57.129
- He's hurt. l'm going.
- Hold up!

24:59.748 --> 25:00.746
Hurry up!

25:05.903 --> 25:08.897
ls he breathing?
Faster, come on!

25:12.138 --> 25:13.335
Hurry!

25:15.818 --> 25:17.116
What is it?

25:19.793 --> 25:20.791
Careful.

25:24.783 --> 25:27.777
- Get something for his head.
- He's not breathing.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.323
There's something in his mouth.

25:32.668 --> 25:36.062
- Oh my God!
- Damn! What's that?

25:38.350 --> 25:43.739
A wasp.
Deadly. Poisonous.

25:44.785 --> 25:47.779
He's still not breathing.
What do we do?

25:49.936 --> 25:52.930
- How did this happen?
- Alcohol.

25:54.582 --> 25:57.077
l've got whiskey in my flask.

26:00.376 --> 26:03.569
- Quickly.
- What's that for?

26:14.541 --> 26:18.533
- He's breathing!
- That's it. He'll be all right.

26:39.187 --> 26:42.879
- He seems okay, we should go now.
- The radio don't work.

26:45.327 --> 26:48.320
- l can't fix, okay?
- We can start now.

26:48.667 --> 26:51.661
No... fog.

26:51.821 --> 26:56.612
We must get him to hospital soon,
or he'll die.

26:57.205 --> 26:59.201
What?
Terri, we got lights.

27:01.267 --> 27:05.259
Good.
Mateo, we'll just double back.

27:07.312 --> 27:10.306
Fighting the current, lose two days.

27:11.485 --> 27:15.976
Cut back to this tributary,
save us fifty miles.

27:19.187 --> 27:24.376
- This the route you suggested that we take yesterday.
- Yesterday for a different reason.

27:24.472 --> 27:28.464
Now, it's to get Professor Cale
to hospital as fast as possible.

27:32.837 --> 27:36.829
l hope you know what you're doing.
l don't know about this dude.

27:38.294 --> 27:40.290
What choice do l have?

28:26.566 --> 28:30.059
What the hell is this?
Terri, come here.

28:37.247 --> 28:42.237
- This is the river you know?
- No, this is new.

28:43.893 --> 28:46.189
But no cause for panic.

28:50.576 --> 28:54.568
l'm not panicking. l'm just looking
at this wall blocking our way.

28:56.575 --> 29:01.565
- Let's see what we can do.
- Its that dynamite?

29:01.566 --> 29:03.163
lt's always good to be prepared.

29:03.182 --> 29:04.379
Prepared for what?

29:06.465 --> 29:09.758
- That thing must be there for a reason
- Yeah, to keep us out.

29:11.243 --> 29:14.736
I'm talking about upsetting
the ecological balance of this river.

29:15.917 --> 29:20.707
l can blow it in ten minutes, so if you feeling
sensitive, we can turn around and lose two days.

29:20.730 --> 29:22.227
It's up to you.

29:27.288 --> 29:28.467
Terri?

29:30.770 --> 29:33.764
For God's sake,
blow the bloody thing!

29:35.896 --> 29:38.890
Just give me ten minutes, people.
Ten minutes.

29:40.455 --> 29:43.948
l need some help.
Gary, get the little boat.

30:29.345 --> 30:31.341
- There's something down there.
- That's right.

30:32.511 --> 30:33.509
I really mean it.

30:33.718 --> 30:34.716
I really mean it too.

30:40.115 --> 30:41.313
Hurry.

31:15.839 --> 31:17.835
Damn it! Snakes!

31:22.025 --> 31:26.516
- Babies!
- How do we get them off the boat?

31:26.681 --> 31:29.675
Come on babies,
come on back to your Mama.

31:33.709 --> 31:35.306
They're not all babies.

31:39.005 --> 31:40.003
Calm.

31:42.097 --> 31:45.091
- You little shit!
- Sarone, help him, get it off.

31:46.943 --> 31:50.336
Someone get this bloody thing
off my hand!

31:53.417 --> 31:57.608
- So young, and so lethal.
- Get it off me!

32:04.757 --> 32:06.254
Later, Sweetie!

32:06.641 --> 32:09.935
- You knew there were snakes here!
Didn't you Sarone.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.992
- lt was a pleasant surprise.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.294
- What about the fuel?

32:13.371 --> 32:17.363
- There's only one drum left
that's enough for about 100 km.

32:17.760 --> 32:20.754
About a day's ride.
That will have to do.

32:22.436 --> 32:23.434
Back to your mother.

32:40.305 --> 32:44.496
- How's he doing?
- He's breathing normally now.

32:44.918 --> 32:45.916
That's good.

32:46.852 --> 32:51.942
- We'll get him home.
- l just don't know what's going on, you know.

32:54.861 --> 32:58.354
Sarone supposed to help us get back to the hospital, right?

32:59.146 --> 33:01.142
But he acts like he owns this river.

33:02.528 --> 33:08.616
And we run into a barrier full of
snakes. Where's he taking us?

33:36.657 --> 33:40.649
Mateo... Mateo. Stop the boat.

33:45.023 --> 33:48.216
- Stop it.
Why are we stopping now?

33:49.472 --> 33:50.470
There'll be fuel.

33:55.118 --> 33:59.609
- You know that boat?
- There's lots of boats like that.

34:03.316 --> 34:04.314
Hello!

34:11.154 --> 34:13.748
l get the impression
there's nobody home.

34:13.833 --> 34:16.827
Mateo, come with me.

34:20.027 --> 34:21.025
Hold up.

34:22.429 --> 34:26.621
- l'll get this on film.
- You don't need sound, do you?

35:37.966 --> 35:39.463
Go aft.

36:11.772 --> 36:13.269
Sarone!

36:21.471 --> 36:24.565
- Kind of spooky.
- You think so?

36:37.457 --> 36:38.954
What the...

37:16.947 --> 37:18.943
- Help me.
- What's that?

37:20.547 --> 37:22.044
Treasures.

37:31.224 --> 37:32.721
Here.

37:37.150 --> 37:40.144
Be careful, my camera's in here.

37:49.615 --> 37:52.609
Mateo, that's it let's go!

37:53.022 --> 37:55.716
Hei... l'm coming.
l'm coming.

38:29.164 --> 38:30.461
What's all this?

38:30.487 --> 38:33.282
- And what about the fuel?
- There wasn't any fuel.

38:33.324 --> 38:38.413
- Where's Mateo?
- I don't know, he was right behind us.

38:40.203 --> 38:41.201
Mateo!

38:48.431 --> 38:51.924
- l'm going back.
- Sarone, go with him.

38:53.393 --> 38:57.385
- Maybe some other time.
- Asshole.

39:04.491 --> 39:07.984
We stuck in the middle of nowhere,
and now we've lost our driver!

39:08.367 --> 39:09.864
Mateo!

39:15.748 --> 39:17.744
Come on man, stop playing!

39:44.504 --> 39:45.502
Danny?

39:48.703 --> 39:49.701
Danny?

39:55.392 --> 39:56.390
Danny?

39:58.130 --> 40:00.126
- Yeah.
- You okay?

40:00.310 --> 40:06.597
- l'm all right. l didn't see him.
- How very reassuring!

40:08.441 --> 40:11.235
- This is it.
- This is all you found?

40:16.092 --> 40:19.386
- What the hell is this?
- Anaconda skin.

40:20.837 --> 40:24.529
- Is snake out there this big?
- It's skin maybe four years old.

40:24.646 --> 40:28.638
lt's grown by now. Something like
this made a meal of our captain.

40:33.152 --> 40:36.645
- Snakes don't eat people.
- Oh... they don't?

40:39.197 --> 40:43.688
Anacondas are perfect killing machines.
They have heat sensors.

40:44.168 --> 40:48.160
A warm body like Mateo's
in the water, wasn't hard to find.

40:49.214 --> 40:54.204
They strike, wrap around you.
Hold you tighter than your true lover.

40:54.414 --> 41:01.400
You get to hear your bones break
before your veins explode.

41:02.911 --> 41:06.404
- Mateo's probably just lost.
- Oh, wake up!

41:07.100 --> 41:12.589
lmagine capturing it alive.
That's worth a lot of money, Gary.

41:15.139 --> 41:22.125
Please people, don't make me out
to be a monster. l didn't eat the Captain Mateo.

41:23.921 --> 41:28.412
Come on, everybody...
We are not sure that Mateo is dead.

41:29.098 --> 41:32.391
- So, we'll wait here till morning.
- Are you insane?

41:32.485 --> 41:37.275
You think he went for a walk?
We've got to get out of here.

41:37.364 --> 41:39.659
- Get a grip Westridge!!
- I've got a grip.

41:39.719 --> 41:42.713
We're not leaving.
lf it was you, you'd want us to stay too.

41:42.912 --> 41:46.904
Listen! lf it was me out there,
l'd be dead. Don't you see.

41:47.590 --> 41:53.379
- Just, go into your cabin, and lock the door.
- Like a bad boy.

41:53.629 --> 41:55.625
All right. All right.

41:55.643 --> 41:57.639
Where are my shoes?

41:59.072 --> 42:02.066
- We'll aim some lights at the boat.
- That's a good idea.

42:26.455 --> 42:29.449
l'm not so sure
he didn't eat the captain.

42:30.544 --> 42:32.540
He sure looks satiated.

42:37.614 --> 42:39.311
You think he's still alive?

42:42.057 --> 42:44.053
No. Let's go to bed.

42:47.069 --> 42:48.267
Danger...

42:50.219 --> 42:53.712
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?

42:54.586 --> 42:59.576
You go on to bed,
l'll just talk to him a second.

42:59.665 --> 43:02.659
- Hurry up, l'm scared.
- l'll be right there.

43:12.393 --> 43:16.385
- So... lt's out there, isn't it?
- Yeah.

43:16.874 --> 43:20.866
- And you know how to catch this things right?
- That's right.

43:20.904 --> 43:26.792
But you can't catch anaconda
by yourself, you need a partner.

43:26.820 --> 43:30.812
Capture alive...
Maybe a million dollars, Gary.

43:40.792 --> 43:43.786
REPTlLE TRANQUlLLlZER

44:06.890 --> 44:08.886
Still no Mateo.

44:51.797 --> 44:53.793
Keep it steady, Westridge!

45:05.391 --> 45:10.082
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Anaconda bait.

45:10.107 --> 45:11.105
Oh my God!

45:17.759 --> 45:21.951
- Westridge, let's go.
- Stop! Not on my boat.

45:22.493 --> 45:27.982
You speak for everybody? Gary?
Does she speak for everybody?

45:31.368 --> 45:32.366
Gary?

45:35.943 --> 45:40.933
With Cale sick, the movie's off.
Why not salvage something?

45:41.348 --> 45:44.941
Let's film Sarone
capturing the big snake.

45:45.489 --> 45:50.990
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, l'm completely lucid.

45:51.053 --> 45:54.246
I think it's you guys
who need to open your eyes.

45:54.326 --> 45:58.518
Are we go for taking Cale to hospital,
now we're catching a snake?

45:58.587 --> 46:01.781
You know where you're,
you're in the middle of the jungle!

46:01.810 --> 46:04.804
All you guys do is question and criticize.

46:04.805 --> 46:09.795
But just remember, you don't know shit
about all this. Neither do l.

46:09.854 --> 46:15.443
But l know who does. This guy!
Paul has been here.

46:15.463 --> 46:20.354
lf we help him catch the snake,
then he'll help us get out of here, alive.

46:20.371 --> 46:24.363
And that is common freaking sense.

46:24.498 --> 46:30.387
Come on, Gary, this isn't you!
Honey, what did he do to you?

46:30.390 --> 46:33.184
Stop.
Think of the money.

46:33.194 --> 46:39.182
lmagine capturing something like this
on film for the first time ever.

46:39.698 --> 46:41.794
Just to be honest, what else we suppose to do?

46:42.312 --> 46:47.302
l know what l'm doing. l'm gonna
throw you two in the river by myself!

46:51.105 --> 46:54.099
- l don't think so.
- I didn't want this to happen people.

46:56.562 --> 46:58.059
- Let's go, Westridge.
- Ok.

47:00.108 --> 47:01.106
Gary.

47:02.701 --> 47:05.695
Occupy yourselves.
Play some cards.

48:26.309 --> 48:27.806
Nobody move!

49:04.083 --> 49:07.077
Gary, turn on the lights!

49:08.026 --> 49:10.621
Westridge, stop the boat.

49:15.238 --> 49:16.536
Buenas noches!

49:18.259 --> 49:21.952
- Come down here, Westridge.
- You'll get us killed!

49:21.967 --> 49:26.957
That's it, go for the eyes!
Blind it!

49:30.119 --> 49:31.616
Fishing for snakes! He's crazy!

49:31.618 --> 49:36.109
- Just let it go.
- Westridge, come here! Come down here!

50:02.579 --> 50:03.577
Where is it?

50:26.333 --> 50:28.628
Don't move. l'll tranquillize it.

50:48.815 --> 50:51.310
Denise, get up here!
Get up here!

50:56.352 --> 50:57.849
Gary, help me!

51:00.204 --> 51:02.657
- Get up here!
- Grab her, man!

51:08.547 --> 51:10.044
lt's in the water.

51:24.326 --> 51:25.823
Gary, give me your hand.

51:33.560 --> 51:36.554
No!
it's no good to me dead.

51:40.149 --> 51:42.145
Gary!

51:45.056 --> 51:47.052
Oh God!

52:23.335 --> 52:25.830
May the souls
of the faithful departed...

52:26.629 --> 52:30.122
... through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

52:33.502 --> 52:35.498
- Westridge!
- How dare you!

52:38.466 --> 52:43.456
lt was you who brought that snake.
You brought the devil.

52:44.414 --> 52:51.001
There's a devil inside everyone.
Horrible.

52:51.101 --> 52:52.099
Westridge.

52:59.253 --> 53:01.748
Take my gear up to the pilot house.

53:02.778 --> 53:06.770
- l'm not your bloody poodle.
- What?

53:07.045 --> 53:11.037
- You presume to order me about?
- Presume?

53:12.187 --> 53:15.680
How you like l presume
to throw you in the river?

53:18.091 --> 53:20.586
- Take it upstairs.
- Thank you.

53:24.408 --> 53:27.402
Everyone else, don't move.

53:30.816 --> 53:31.814
Get back.

53:46.325 --> 53:48.321
Terri, let's talk.

55:11.285 --> 55:12.583
You want something?

55:16.880 --> 55:18.377
l just want to talk to you.

55:26.843 --> 55:28.839
I was thinking about the myth.

55:31.313 --> 55:39.297
I don't know, I figure all about this,
this film was supposed to be my big break.

55:39.748 --> 55:41.744
And it's turned out to be a big disaster.

55:47.906 --> 55:49.403
So l was just thinking -

55:52.248 --> 55:58.236
- that maybe l could film you capturing the snake.

56:01.827 --> 56:04.322
And then it wouldn't have all been for nothing.

56:07.444 --> 56:09.440
I don't know
lt could be dangerous.

56:11.669 --> 56:12.667
l know.

56:18.629 --> 56:21.024
But you'd be there to protect us.

56:21.605 --> 56:23.002
You need protection?

56:29.257 --> 56:35.245
lt's been a long time...
since l had a woman.

56:45.871 --> 56:47.169
You think l'm stupid?

56:49.932 --> 56:51.130
l'm not stupid!

56:57.788 --> 56:59.983
- Shall l hit him again? To make sure...
- No just throw him in the river!

57:00.077 --> 57:01.674
Haven't we enough of that?

57:01.870 --> 57:06.860
- l'm afraid l'd rather enjoy it.
- Come on, just tie him up! Ok.

57:40.690 --> 57:42.686
This was all one big setup, huh?

57:44.130 --> 57:49.120
Mateo, you stranded,
the shipwrecked boat...

57:49.141 --> 57:52.135
- Your route to the hospital.
- You forgot the wasp.

58:03.836 --> 58:09.824
What you do is not so hard.
l can trap a snake, too.

58:10.424 --> 58:14.416
As smart as you are,
you can survive without me.

58:25.217 --> 58:27.712
We're gonna be home soon, okay?

58:48.055 --> 58:52.047
l can't believe how good
you're doing. Hang in there, baby.

58:58.144 --> 59:02.136
- ls it hard to drive?
- No. Like a Cadillac Fleetwood.

59:02.714 --> 59:05.508
I tell you up...
l'll give you a driving lesson.

59:05.592 --> 59:09.284
Black knobs:
Up to get forward and down here back.

59:09.442 --> 59:12.735
Red knobs:
Up to get fast and down to get slow.

59:12.950 --> 59:18.239
Wheel: left and right.
You get any trouble, turn off the ignition.

59:18.447 --> 59:23.437
Take it for a spin.
Take us back to civilisation.

59:23.749 --> 59:28.739
- Shit, no problem!
- Take us back to...

59:29.829 --> 59:34.719
- Crisp sheets and hot showers.
- The play-offs and a six-pack!

59:34.802 --> 59:40.291
- Golf, and a gin and tonic.
- L.A. traffic and mobile phones.

59:40.366 --> 59:41.364
Don't start!

01:00:05.988 --> 01:00:10.479
The waterfall.
A beautiful sight, baby bird.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:14.592
- The legend was right.
- What is this place?

01:00:18.481 --> 01:00:21.475
Oh dear.
lt's absolutely beautiful.

01:00:27.893 --> 01:00:30.887
- What the hell was that?
- l think we hit the bottom.

01:00:33.224 --> 01:00:35.220
Turn the wheel hard over left.

01:00:38.220 --> 01:00:39.717
All right, put it in reverse.

01:00:42.565 --> 01:00:43.563
Shut it down.

01:00:59.188 --> 01:01:01.283
We got to winch ourselves loose.

01:01:01.296 --> 01:01:05.089
Wait, wait what are you doing?
And get in the water?

01:01:05.155 --> 01:01:10.743
We ain't got much choice.
We'll wrap a rope around that tree.

01:01:10.787 --> 01:01:15.578
You wrap a rope around that tree.
pull it tight or we're stuck here forever.

01:01:15.597 --> 01:01:22.084
- We've got to make it quick, in and out.
- l rather hoped l'd done my bit.

01:01:26.065 --> 01:01:28.660
- That's our rope.
- Just enough to go round the tree right?

01:01:28.660 --> 01:01:29.657
Yeah.

01:01:30.036 --> 01:01:33.828
Take this and get it around
that trunk, make sure it's secure.

01:01:33.859 --> 01:01:34.857
Roger that.

01:01:36.906 --> 01:01:41.896
Last time l tried this, l had to
pick leeches off my scrotum.

01:02:18.677 --> 01:02:20.174
Aren't you going to pray?

01:02:21.860 --> 01:02:24.854
Never look in the eyes
of those you kill.

01:02:26.048 --> 01:02:29.042
They will haunt you forever.
l know.

01:02:41.209 --> 01:02:42.706
l firmly resolve...

01:02:43.136 --> 01:02:48.126
... with help and grace
to confess my sins...

01:02:48.505 --> 01:02:50.501
... and amend my life. Amen!

01:02:52.176 --> 01:02:56.168
Sanctus... sanctus... sanctus...

01:02:57.388 --> 01:02:58.386
... baby bird.

01:03:20.188 --> 01:03:21.186
Hurry up.

01:03:39.738 --> 01:03:43.730
Shit! back on the boat.
Now! Come on!

01:03:44.593 --> 01:03:45.591
Go!

01:03:49.345 --> 01:03:52.339
Get on the boat. Go on, hurry!

01:03:59.958 --> 01:04:01.954
Over here, you fat-ass bastard!

01:04:16.170 --> 01:04:17.467
Westridge... get up on the rocks.

01:04:17.541 --> 01:04:19.537
- Go!
- Get up on the rocks.

01:09:32.663 --> 01:09:35.158

01:10:26.562 --> 01:10:27.760

Those drums...
Could be fuel.

01:11:04.949 --> 01:11:06.446
A snake skin.

01:11:17.086 --> 01:11:20.279
- Look there's plenty of fuel in here.
- Welcome!

01:12:06.982 --> 01:12:08.479
Time to wake up.

01:12:19.176 --> 01:12:22.469
- Monkey blood.

01:12:23.935 --> 01:12:25.431
Don't get me upset.

01:12:32.307 --> 01:12:33.504

01:12:35.027 --> 01:12:38.520
Human bones.
That's how it comes out.

01:12:39.246 --> 01:12:40.543
Ashes to ashes ...

01:12:58.248 --> 01:13:00.743

01:17:07.515 --> 01:17:09.511
Hurry, l think l can blow him up.

01:17:23.310 --> 01:17:25.805

- Go ahead, l'm at the top.

01:17:35.109 --> 01:17:36.406
Danny!

01:17:41.784 --> 01:17:44.379
- Get out, the fuse is lit.
- Danny, wait!

01:17:48.066 --> 01:17:50.561
Push on the other side

01:18:07.962 --> 01:18:10.656

01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:11.948
Just jump!

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:10.871
We got him.

01:19:14.577 --> 01:19:16.074
You all right?

01:19:20.002 --> 01:19:23.495

01:20:21.207 --> 01:20:22.205
Miss Flores...

01:20:26.141 --> 01:20:27.438
You're a mess.
