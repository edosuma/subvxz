00:02.961 --> 00:04.825
<i>Previously on</i> Damages...

00:04.965 --> 00:08.383
HEWES: Naomi Walling found herself
entangled in an insider trading scandal.

00:08.479 --> 00:11.057
She went to Channing McClaren
intending to be a whistle-blower.

00:11.191 --> 00:13.992
O'DONNELL: Ms. Walling's e-mails
were included in the leak.

00:13.994 --> 00:16.126
HEWES: As a result of which,
she took her own life.

00:16.129 --> 00:19.330
Suppose Naomi Walling refused
to leak what she knew.

00:19.332 --> 00:23.100
STAHL: The easiest way would be to
steal it from the Princefield system.

00:23.102 --> 00:25.469
A guy like McClaren would
have no problem hacking in.

00:25.471 --> 00:28.172
HERNDON: The S.E.C. has seized
everything for their own investigation.

00:28.174 --> 00:30.641
REINSDORF: I'm not about to let
my agency get drawn into a

00:30.643 --> 00:33.044
civil suit against
Channing McClaren.

00:33.046 --> 00:34.946
Your leak-- you don't
know the whole story.

00:34.948 --> 00:36.848
McCLAREN: Have you ever known
me to pay for information?

00:36.850 --> 00:38.616
PARSONS: What is this
information exactly?

00:38.618 --> 00:40.885
NOVAK: It involves Naomi
Walling and Princefield.

00:40.887 --> 00:42.153
We can't get the cash.

00:42.155 --> 00:43.621
We were hoping you could.

00:43.623 --> 00:45.823
- This thing you're doing...
- I'll be fine.

00:45.825 --> 00:48.526
They're both going to pay.

00:48.528 --> 00:49.727
Good luck with your case.

00:49.729 --> 00:52.763
PARSONS: Come and give me the information,
and I'll transfer the money.

00:52.765 --> 00:53.664
(tires screeching)

00:53.666 --> 00:55.900
Shit.

00:59.204 --> 01:01.906
(man speaking foreign language)

01:05.911 --> 01:08.679
(dog barking)

01:14.353 --> 01:16.721
(Parsons screaming)

01:16.723 --> 01:19.423
(gasping)

01:22.427 --> 01:25.162
(elevator bell dinging)

01:29.268 --> 01:32.103
(horns honking, sirens wailing)

01:35.440 --> 01:36.674
(jackhammer drilling)

01:36.676 --> 01:38.776
(car alarm wailing)

01:46.852 --> 01:48.819
(gasps)

01:48.821 --> 01:52.456
(panting softly)

01:52.458 --> 01:55.059
(quiet knock)

01:55.061 --> 01:57.128
PARSONS: Come in.

01:58.964 --> 01:59.931
FRANKLIN: You okay?

01:59.933 --> 02:03.768
PARSONS: Yeah, yeah, I
must have nodded off.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.569
I haven't been
sleeping very well.

02:05.571 --> 02:06.304
FRANKLIN: Oh.

02:06.306 --> 02:08.639
It's probably just the
stress of the case.

02:08.640 --> 02:09.639
Patty just called.

02:09.642 --> 02:11.809
She's on her way
up for your 10:00.

02:11.811 --> 02:16.681
PARSONS: Okay, I, um, I think I
need to meet with her alone.

02:16.683 --> 02:19.083
FRANKLIN: Of course.

HEWES: I like your office.

03:07.233 --> 03:08.899
PARSONS: Thank you.

03:08.901 --> 03:10.401
HEWES: It's sweet.

03:10.403 --> 03:13.637
PARSONS: Have a seat.

03:13.639 --> 03:16.207
Can I offer you coffee, tea?

03:16.209 --> 03:18.075
HEWES: No, thank you.

03:18.077 --> 03:20.378
PARSONS: Shall we get
down to it, then?

03:20.380 --> 03:24.048
HEWES: I had exposed brick
in my first office.

03:24.050 --> 03:31.088
Back then it was considered
kind of edgy, daring.

03:31.090 --> 03:35.393
PARSONS: So I was hoping we could
discuss the discovery calendar.

03:35.395 --> 03:38.696
HEWES: Absolutely.

03:38.698 --> 03:43.467
There's a piece of discovery in
particular that we may want to address.

03:43.469 --> 03:44.535
PARSONS: What's that?

03:44.537 --> 03:46.670
HEWES: Well, I think you know.

03:46.672 --> 03:50.641
PARSONS: No, nothing's
popping to mind.

03:50.643 --> 03:53.544
HEWES: Think a little harder.

03:56.748 --> 03:58.783
(Parsons chuckles)

04:01.186 --> 04:03.454
I know he approached you.

04:03.456 --> 04:06.824
PARSONS: And who are
you talking about?

04:06.826 --> 04:09.326
HEWES: The hacker gentleman.

04:09.328 --> 04:11.629
PARSONS: Oh, him.

04:11.631 --> 04:13.731
Samurai Seven.

04:13.733 --> 04:15.666
Yes.

04:15.668 --> 04:18.002
He did.

04:20.272 --> 04:23.140
I bought the information.

04:24.776 --> 04:31.182
I thought it was a small price to pay
for something of that significance.

04:31.184 --> 04:34.051
HEWES: Yes, it is.

04:36.555 --> 04:40.624
As CEO for Princefield
Investments, I have called this

04:40.626 --> 04:43.761
press conference to address the
recent allegations of insider

04:43.763 --> 04:46.430
trading at Fund 23.

04:46.432 --> 04:50.501
In light of the information
unearthed by McClarenTruth.org,

04:50.503 --> 04:53.671
I have disbanded Fund 23.

04:53.673 --> 04:57.074
We are working alongside the S.E.C.
to determine the reach

04:57.076 --> 05:02.079
and extent of the damage and to
return funds to our investors.

05:02.081 --> 05:05.382
This is a dark chapter in
Princefield history, but I am

05:05.384 --> 05:08.385
confident that we
have turned the page.

05:08.387 --> 05:12.456
To our investors, we appreciate
your patience, and I give you my

05:12.458 --> 05:16.260
personal pledge to
right our course.

05:16.262 --> 05:20.064
I-I would also like to extend a
personal thank you to Channing

05:20.066 --> 05:23.901
McClaren and his organization
for making this information

05:23.903 --> 05:28.873
public, and if Naomi Walling
leaked the wrongdoing at Fund 23

05:28.875 --> 05:33.277
to Mr. McClaren, I want
to thank her as well.

05:33.279 --> 05:37.581
I am deeply saddened by Ms.
Walling's tragic passing.

05:37.583 --> 05:41.919
Our hearts and prayers go
out to her and her family.

05:41.921 --> 05:47.258
And as to this lawsuit,
I take no sides.

05:47.260 --> 05:48.759
HEWES: I'm back.

05:48.761 --> 05:50.861
HERNDON: Yeah, yeah, uh,
did the Samurai sell that

05:50.863 --> 05:52.663
information to Parsons, too?

05:52.665 --> 05:54.231
HEWES: Hard to tell.

05:54.233 --> 05:56.400
She's developed
quite a poker face.

05:56.402 --> 05:59.436
HERNDON: Well, I, for one,
am assuming she has it.

05:59.438 --> 06:02.306
I mean, I've been through
everything the hacker sent us.

06:02.308 --> 06:03.440
HEWES: What did you find?

06:03.442 --> 06:05.242
HERNDON: Well, it's
like you said.

06:05.244 --> 06:08.112
Bennett Herreshoff, the CEO of
Princefield, was conducting an

06:08.114 --> 06:10.681
internal investigation
on Naomi Walling.

06:10.683 --> 06:13.417
HEWES: Yes, the question
becomes, if Herreshoff was

06:13.419 --> 06:18.255
investigating Naomi, what
did he find out about her?

06:18.257 --> 06:21.525
HERNDON: Go talk to Herreshoff.

06:21.527 --> 06:23.360
(panting and moaning)

06:23.362 --> 06:26.197
Say my name.

06:26.199 --> 06:28.599
Say my name.

06:30.802 --> 06:33.804
Say it.

06:33.806 --> 06:35.940
Please.

06:49.588 --> 06:54.158
McCLAREN: Will you open
these for me, please?

07:03.735 --> 07:07.771
Is there something
wrong with you?

07:10.842 --> 07:13.811
Seriously, is there
something wrong with you?

07:13.813 --> 07:17.081
Why is that so
important right now?

07:40.572 --> 07:46.410
Have you ever been in a
serious relationship?

07:46.412 --> 07:48.779
McCLAREN: What do you mean?

07:48.781 --> 07:51.882
Where people communicate.

07:51.884 --> 07:55.219
Have you ever been
serious with anyone?

08:00.458 --> 08:02.426
What are you doing?

08:02.428 --> 08:03.861
(zips pants)

08:03.863 --> 08:06.530
McCLAREN: I'm leaving.

08:12.904 --> 08:17.574
PARSONS: This was waiting for
me at my office when I arrived.

08:17.576 --> 08:19.510
Addressed to you, care of me.

08:19.512 --> 08:23.013
No stamp-- someone must
have dropped it off.

08:27.118 --> 08:29.987
SIMON: Who is it from?

08:29.989 --> 08:32.188
McCLAREN: I have no idea.

08:32.191 --> 08:35.392
SIMON: What does it say?

08:35.394 --> 08:40.664
McCLAREN: It says I can't stomach
the smell of your lunch.

08:40.666 --> 08:42.732
(footfalls approaching)

08:44.703 --> 08:46.670
You guys enjoy yourselves.

08:46.672 --> 08:49.139
I'm going for a walk.

08:54.879 --> 08:58.749
SIMON: Hey, did you get
to meet with Patty Hewes?

08:58.751 --> 08:59.750
PARSONS: Yeah.

08:59.752 --> 09:01.819
She asked me about the
hacker information.

09:01.821 --> 09:03.420
NOVAK: What did you say?

09:03.422 --> 09:04.421
PARSONS: I lied.

09:04.423 --> 09:05.522
I told her I had it.

09:05.524 --> 09:06.490
NOVAK: Does she have it?

09:06.492 --> 09:10.027
PARSONS: I don't know for sure--
I couldn't read her-- but

09:10.029 --> 09:12.363
I think we have to
assume that she does.

09:12.365 --> 09:14.164
SIMON: Can't the judge
force her to disclose it?

09:14.166 --> 09:17.067
PARSONS: I can formally request
it during discovery, but

09:17.069 --> 09:19.470
I have to prove
that Patty has it.

09:19.472 --> 09:22.239
And Patty will lie about having
it, which is illegal, but that's

09:22.241 --> 09:25.509
exactly what she'll do until I
have evidence to prove otherwise.

09:25.511 --> 09:27.344
NOVAK: Well, we've been keeping
our eye out online for

09:27.346 --> 09:28.979
Samurai, but there's
been no sign of him.

09:28.981 --> 09:31.749
PARSONS: I've got my own investigator
looking into it on the ground.

09:31.751 --> 09:34.251
SIMON: We did discover through
other leads that he has

09:34.253 --> 09:35.519
someone else that he works with.

09:35.521 --> 09:36.754
PARSONS: Do you have a name?

09:36.756 --> 09:40.391
NOVAK: Not a real
one-- a screen name.

09:40.393 --> 09:41.458
PARSONS: Great.

09:41.460 --> 09:43.193
NOVAK: We're not
familiar with him.

09:43.195 --> 09:45.996
PARSONS: I'll see what
my guy can do with it.

09:45.998 --> 09:48.198
HERRESHOFF: It's a pleasure
to meet you, Ms. Hewes.

09:48.200 --> 09:51.668
I've been a long-time
admirer from afar.

09:51.670 --> 09:53.537
HEWES: That's a surprise.

09:53.539 --> 09:55.973
I haven't been much of a
friend to your industry.

09:55.975 --> 09:57.941
HERRESHOFF: I respect conviction.

09:57.943 --> 10:00.944
Please sit.

10:00.946 --> 10:03.080
So obviously I've been
following your case.

10:03.082 --> 10:06.383
I have to say it's hard
for me to take sides.

10:06.385 --> 10:07.684
HEWES: And why is that?

10:07.686 --> 10:09.887
HERRESHOFF: What Naomi Walling
and Channing McClaren

10:09.889 --> 10:16.126
did together revealed a growing
cancer within my company.

10:16.128 --> 10:19.496
And as a cancer survivor, I
don't use the term lightly.

10:19.498 --> 10:22.466
I'm grateful to them both.

10:22.468 --> 10:26.437
I hate to see Naomi's daughter and
Channing McClaren at each other's throats.

10:26.439 --> 10:31.074
HEWES: So Naomi Walling was
a valued employee of yours?

10:31.076 --> 10:34.077
HERRESHOFF: Nice woman,
very smart trader.

10:34.079 --> 10:41.118
HEWES: Then, why were you conducting
an internal investigation on her?

10:43.822 --> 10:48.325
These are copies of documents
I have obtained that clearly

10:48.327 --> 10:52.196
indicate that Princefield
Investments was actively

10:52.198 --> 10:55.466
investigating Naomi Walling.

10:55.468 --> 10:58.669
HERRESHOFF: How
did you get them?

10:58.671 --> 11:02.973
HEWES: The point
is, I have them.

11:02.975 --> 11:06.877
HERRESHOFF: Has this been
leaked to the public?

11:06.879 --> 11:11.582
HEWES: That's not how I
work, Mr. Herreshoff.

11:11.584 --> 11:16.253
The memos indicate that you suspected
Ms. Walling's trading patterns.

11:16.255 --> 11:18.288
HERRESHOFF: Yes, she was
involved in the insider trading

11:18.290 --> 11:20.257
before she decided
to blow the whistle.

11:20.259 --> 11:21.992
Why are you showing
these to me?

11:21.994 --> 11:24.528
HEWES: I'm representing
Naomi's daughter.

11:24.530 --> 11:28.398
I need to know everything I can
about what happened to her mother.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.567
HERRESHOFF: Of course.

11:30.569 --> 11:33.704
HEWES: So, what do you
have on Ms. Walling?

11:33.706 --> 11:36.907
Where did your
investigation lead?

11:36.909 --> 11:42.112
HERRESHOFF: I would love to help,
but unfortunately I can't.

11:42.114 --> 11:44.281
The S.E.C.
took over the investigation.

11:44.283 --> 11:47.818
I am bound by law not
to talk about it.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.419
HEWES: The S.E.C.?

11:49.421 --> 11:50.954
HERRESHOFF: Yes.

11:50.956 --> 11:53.757
We felt it was best handled
by an outside agency.

11:53.759 --> 11:55.425
HEWES: And who at the S.E.C.

11:55.427 --> 11:57.127
did you speak to?

11:57.129 --> 11:59.162
HERRESHOFF: Reinsdorf. Clark.

11:59.164 --> 12:04.768
He'll tell you we've done everything the
S.E.C. has asked of us to cooperate.

12:04.770 --> 12:09.973
HEWES: I'm not coming after
you, Mr. Herreshoff.

12:09.975 --> 12:11.575
HERRESHOFF: That's a relief.

12:11.577 --> 12:14.912
HEWES: Not yet, anyway.

12:18.850 --> 12:20.984
I'm glad you got my letter.

12:20.986 --> 12:23.620
I saw on the news you
were back in New York.

12:23.622 --> 12:27.124
I didn't know how else to
get in touch with you.

12:27.126 --> 12:29.893
McCLAREN: I thought our
arrangement was more than fair.

12:29.895 --> 12:32.763
It was, but things change.

12:32.765 --> 12:33.964
McCLAREN: How's that?

12:33.966 --> 12:35.499
Charlie's getting worse.

12:35.501 --> 12:37.200
McCLAREN: What's wrong with him?

12:37.202 --> 12:39.670
No one really knows.

12:39.672 --> 12:40.804
One doctor says it's autism.

12:40.806 --> 12:42.472
Another one says
it's Asperger's.

12:42.474 --> 12:48.145
All I know is he's not
relating to the other kids.

12:48.147 --> 12:51.248
No one knows how to
get close to him.

12:51.250 --> 12:58.055
He just shuts out the world,
holes up and draws.

12:58.057 --> 12:59.256
McCLAREN: Draws what?

12:59.258 --> 13:03.460
I don't know, maps,
fantasy shit.

13:03.462 --> 13:09.166
Worlds that he makes
up in his mind.

13:09.168 --> 13:13.337
You are the last fucking
person I want to beg from.

13:13.339 --> 13:15.806
But something's wrong with him.

13:15.808 --> 13:19.543
I need to put him in a
school where he gets help.

13:23.348 --> 13:26.149
He and Jeff just don't mix.

13:26.151 --> 13:27.284
McCLAREN: Who?

13:27.286 --> 13:29.019
No one.

13:29.021 --> 13:30.120
McCLAREN: Who is he?

13:30.122 --> 13:34.257
Just some guy I
shouldn't be seeing.

13:34.259 --> 13:37.761
So are you gonna
help us out or not?

13:37.763 --> 13:40.030
McCLAREN: I'll send more money.

13:40.032 --> 13:41.665
But first I want to meet him.

13:41.667 --> 13:44.768
You do not want to meet Jeff.

13:44.770 --> 13:47.270
McCLAREN: I'm talking
about Charlie.

13:47.272 --> 13:50.607
Charlie does not need
another man in his life.

13:50.609 --> 13:51.675
He's got enough going on.

13:51.677 --> 13:54.811
McCLAREN: You want the money,
you heard my condition.

13:58.883 --> 14:02.853
Look, you really want to help him,
why don't you put him in a program?

14:02.855 --> 14:04.855
But I don't need you
dicking with his mind.

14:04.857 --> 14:06.823
McCLAREN: I want to meet my son.

14:06.825 --> 14:09.926
Yeah, well, why don't
you go fuck yourself?

14:19.570 --> 14:21.805
PARSONS: So?

14:21.807 --> 14:25.575
COOPER: Your man, Samurai Seven,
is not so easy to find.

14:25.577 --> 14:27.711
PARSONS: Did you try
contacting him online?

14:27.713 --> 14:28.712
COOPER: Yeah.

14:28.714 --> 14:29.713
No response.

14:29.715 --> 14:33.216
Then I went and talked to some
computer guys I know from the corps.

14:33.218 --> 14:34.217
Military intelligence guys.

14:34.219 --> 14:36.219
They know something
about hacking.

14:36.221 --> 14:38.255
PARSONS: They ever heard
of Samurai Seven?

14:38.257 --> 14:39.256
COOPER: Heard of him.

14:39.258 --> 14:40.624
But only his handle.

14:40.626 --> 14:41.858
They don't know his real name.

14:41.860 --> 14:45.195
PARSONS: What about the bank account
that I transferred the money to?

14:45.197 --> 14:46.229
COOPER: I looked into it.

14:46.231 --> 14:49.833
The account number belongs to a
shell company, an S7 Enterprises?

14:49.835 --> 14:51.001
PARSONS: S7, that's him.

14:51.003 --> 14:54.304
COOPER: Yeah, but there's no name on
the account, just the company address.

14:54.306 --> 14:56.306
I've been staking out the
place for the past two days.

14:56.308 --> 14:57.307
PARSONS: And?

14:57.309 --> 15:00.410
COOPER: A few women have come
and gone, but there's no guy.

15:00.412 --> 15:01.912
You sure Samurai
Seven is a man?

15:01.914 --> 15:03.480
PARSONS: Yeah.

15:03.482 --> 15:05.849
Yeah, I spoke to
him on the phone.

15:05.851 --> 15:07.884
COOPER: Then I don't
know what to tell you.

15:07.886 --> 15:09.920
You get anything from
McClaren's people?

15:09.922 --> 15:12.489
PARSONS: Apparently Samurai
Seven hangs out with this guy.

15:12.491 --> 15:15.225
They work together sometimes.

15:15.227 --> 15:16.993
COOPER: Blackbird.

15:16.995 --> 15:20.931
PARSONS: It's just his screen name;
I don't know how that will help.

15:20.933 --> 15:24.034
COOPER: Blackbird.

15:24.036 --> 15:26.036
Shit.

15:26.038 --> 15:28.605
REINSDORF: Bennett
Herreshoff sent you here.

15:28.607 --> 15:32.743
HEWES: He claims he turned over the Naomi
Walling investigation to your agency.

15:32.745 --> 15:35.212
Is that true?

15:35.214 --> 15:36.346
REINSDORF: Yes.

15:36.348 --> 15:39.983
Herreshoff contacted us after
he suspected Walling and her

15:39.985 --> 15:43.019
fund of placing improper trades.

15:43.021 --> 15:45.222
HEWES: What did you find?

15:45.224 --> 15:48.592
REINSDORF: The nature of the
fund's returns was highly unusual.

15:48.594 --> 15:53.463
HEWES: If you knew there was insider
trading, why didn't you do anything?

15:53.465 --> 15:55.732
REINSDORF: The
investigation is ongoing.

15:55.734 --> 15:56.867
We aren't finished.

15:56.869 --> 16:00.937
HEWES: Is that the best you
can do, Mr. Reinsdorf?

16:00.939 --> 16:04.007
REINSDORF: It's the truth.

16:04.009 --> 16:05.308
HEWES: Maybe.

16:05.310 --> 16:09.379
But what will the public think?

16:09.381 --> 16:14.351
Channing McClaren blew the lid
off information the S.E.C.

16:14.353 --> 16:18.255
already had but didn't act on.

16:18.257 --> 16:21.825
REINSDORF: That is
completely unfair.

16:21.827 --> 16:24.594
HEWES: Nevertheless.

16:24.596 --> 16:28.999
Perception is everything.

16:29.001 --> 16:30.200
REINSDORF: What's that?

16:30.202 --> 16:32.936
HEWES: It's just a little
press release I've prepared.

16:32.938 --> 16:37.941
It exposes the criminal inaction
on the part of the S.E.C. in

16:37.943 --> 16:43.780
regards to insider
trading at Fund 23.

16:45.683 --> 16:47.684
There's a reporter at the <i>Times</i>

16:47.686 --> 16:51.388
<i>waiting on my call to print it.</i>

16:53.991 --> 16:55.959
<i>REINSDORF: Fuck you.</i>

16:55.961 --> 16:58.428
<i>HEWES: I'm not looking
to sink you.</i>

16:58.430 --> 17:01.364
<i>I just want you to do
something for me.</i>

17:01.366 --> 17:03.466
<i>REINSDORF: And what
would that be?</i>

17:03.468 --> 17:06.837
<i>HEWES: Get me access to
everything you know about the</i>

17:06.839 --> 17:08.204
<i>Walling investigation.</i>

17:08.207 --> 17:11.875
<i>REINSDORF: How about narrowing
it down a little bit?</i>

17:11.877 --> 17:16.313
<i>HEWES: All right, specifically,
did you find any</i>

17:16.315 --> 17:18.415
<i>evidence that Naomi Walling was</i>

17:18.416 --> 17:21.151
<i>in communication with
Channing McClaren?</i>

17:21.153 --> 17:23.653
<i>REINSDORF: Well, offhand
I couldn't tell you.</i>

17:23.655 --> 17:24.820
<i>We have thousands of recordings</i>

17:24.823 --> 17:26.890
<i>of Walling's communications.</i>

17:26.892 --> 17:29.659
<i>But we were just looking
at insider trading.</i>

17:29.661 --> 17:31.795
<i>HEWES: Do you still
have the recordings?</i>

17:31.797 --> 17:32.796
<i>REINSDORF: Of course.</i>

17:32.798 --> 17:33.930
<i>HEWES: Good.</i>

17:33.932 --> 17:35.198
<i>Go through them.</i>

17:35.200 --> 17:40.570
<i>Get me anything that will
help me in my case.</i>

17:40.572 --> 17:42.706
<i>Otherwise, first
thing tomorrow,</i>

17:42.708 --> 17:45.175
<i>your name's on the front page.</i>

17:51.215 --> 17:54.784
<i>REINSDORF: I will see
what I can find.</i>

17:58.556 --> 18:01.958
<i>Now get the fuck
out of my office.</i>

18:05.630 --> 18:08.131
<i>(phone line ringing)</i>

18:08.133 --> 18:10.133
<i>Yeah, leave a message.</i>

18:10.135 --> 18:11.134
<i>Call me, please.</i>

18:11.136 --> 18:12.135
<i>I'm leaving you the messages.</i>

18:12.137 --> 18:13.136
<i>I'm not hearing from you.</i>

18:13.138 --> 18:14.671
<i>I'm scared.</i>

18:14.673 --> 18:18.241
<i>I think maybe I
should leave town.</i>

18:28.419 --> 18:31.454
<i>COOPER: Blackbird.</i>

18:36.193 --> 18:40.130
<i>HEWES: Well, this witness list has
hardly changed from the last one.</i>

18:40.132 --> 18:42.766
<i>FRANKLIN: Nevertheless,
you requested it.</i>

18:42.768 --> 18:44.267
<i>HEWES: I thought Ellen would</i>

18:44.269 --> 18:46.636
<i>have made more progress by now.</i>

18:46.638 --> 18:48.939
<i>FRANKLIN: Well, the burden is
on the plaintiff, isn't it?</i>

18:48.941 --> 18:51.408
<i>HEWES: Yes, it is.</i>

18:51.410 --> 18:53.810
<i>Thank you for bringing this by.</i>

18:57.648 --> 19:01.718
<i>Now, if you'll excuse
me, I have work to do.</i>

19:08.426 --> 19:12.896
<i>FRANKLIN: I brought cookies.</i>

19:12.898 --> 19:15.999
<i>Ever since Ted died, I have those
nights from time to time,</i>

19:16.001 --> 19:22.672
<i>and it's hard to sleep in an empty bed, so...
Well, I bake.</i>

19:22.674 --> 19:26.443
<i>HEWES: Well, thanks for
the offer, but...</i>

19:29.814 --> 19:31.948
<i>FRANKLIN: You know what?</i>

19:31.950 --> 19:35.018
<i>In case you change your mind.</i>

19:46.364 --> 19:51.735
<i>I can see that you're busy, but there
is something that we need to discuss.</i>

19:51.737 --> 19:53.169
<i>You received my letter?</i>

19:53.171 --> 19:54.304
<i>HEWES (sighing): Yes, I did.</i>

19:54.306 --> 19:56.072
<i>FRANKLIN: You never responded.</i>

19:56.074 --> 19:56.773
<i>HEWES: No need to.</i>

19:56.775 --> 19:58.942
<i>I'm focused on the
McClaren case.</i>

19:58.944 --> 20:01.611
<i>I have no further business
with your other client.</i>

20:01.613 --> 20:03.680
<i>FRANKLIN: But he would very much
like to sit down with you.</i>

20:03.682 --> 20:06.483
<i>He is ill, and given his
condition, there are certain</i>

20:06.485 --> 20:09.085
<i>matters that he would
like to tie up.</i>

20:09.087 --> 20:13.289
<i>HEWES: That case
is long settled.</i>

20:13.291 --> 20:17.861
<i>Tell your client there is
nothing more to discuss.</i>

20:17.863 --> 20:18.862
<i>Maggie.</i>

20:18.864 --> 20:19.729
<i>MAGGIE: Yes, Ms. Hewes.</i>

20:19.731 --> 20:21.931
<i>HEWES: Would you show
Mrs. Franklin out?</i>

20:21.933 --> 20:24.000
<i>FRANKLIN: No need.</i>

20:32.009 --> 20:35.912
<i>Oh, you can get the Tupperware
back to me whenever.</i>

20:58.502 --> 21:00.270
<i>This is desert.</i>

21:00.272 --> 21:01.504
<i>These are mountains.</i>

21:01.506 --> 21:06.176
<i>The only way to get from here to here
is to drive in an all-terrain vehicle.</i>

21:06.178 --> 21:07.844
<i>This is desert.</i>

21:07.846 --> 21:09.212
<i>These are mountains.</i>

21:09.214 --> 21:12.382
<i>The only way to get from here
to here is to drive in an</i>

21:12.384 --> 21:14.184
<i>all-terrain vehicle.</i>

21:14.186 --> 21:16.419
<i>Charlie, did you order?</i>

21:16.421 --> 21:18.321
<i>You have ten seconds or
you're not eating lunch.</i>

21:18.323 --> 21:20.056
<i>CHARLIE: The only way to get
from here to here is to</i>

21:20.058 --> 21:21.091
<i>drive in an all-terrain vehicle.</i>

21:21.093 --> 21:22.092
<i>Order.</i>

21:22.094 --> 21:22.892
<i>I'm serious.</i>

21:22.894 --> 21:23.893
<i>My shift starts in 20 minutes.</i>

21:23.895 --> 21:25.595
<i>I'm not waiting here
the rest of my life.</i>

21:25.597 --> 21:27.597
<i>CHARLIE: - This is desert...
- Let me call you back.</i>

21:27.599 --> 21:28.465
<i>Order your goddamn lunch.</i>

21:28.467 --> 21:31.167
<i>CHARLIE: The only way to
get from here to here...</i>

21:31.169 --> 21:31.901
<i>I'm serious.</i>

21:31.903 --> 21:32.569
<i>Are you gonna order?</i>

21:32.571 --> 21:33.236
<i>CHARLIE: This is desert.</i>

21:33.238 --> 21:34.604
<i>These are mountains.</i>

21:34.606 --> 21:35.839
<i>Are you gonna order or not?</i>

21:35.841 --> 21:37.307
<i>CHARLIE: - ...is an all-terr...
- Fuck it.</i>

21:37.309 --> 21:38.041
<i>You're done; let's go.</i>

21:38.043 --> 21:38.708
<i>CHARLIE: You ripped it.</i>

21:38.710 --> 21:40.343
<i>Yeah, you don't shut your
face, I'm gonna rip</i>

21:40.345 --> 21:40.977
<i>your fucking head off.</i>

21:40.979 --> 21:41.644
<i>CHARLIE: Ow!</i>

21:41.646 --> 21:45.448
<i>Why do you got to be such a
fucking idiot all the time?</i>

22:01.765 --> 22:04.134
<i>Yeah, leave a message.</i>

22:04.136 --> 22:04.801
<i>(beep)</i>

22:04.803 --> 22:06.002
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>

22:06.004 --> 22:08.438
<i>I'm getting on a plane
to see my parents.</i>

22:08.440 --> 22:09.439
<i>Call me, please.</i>

22:09.441 --> 22:11.508
<i>I'm very worried.</i>

22:13.577 --> 22:16.079
<i>(knocking)</i>

22:16.081 --> 22:17.080
<i>Who is it?</i>

22:17.082 --> 22:19.215
<i>COOPER: I'm a friend
of the Samurai.</i>

22:19.217 --> 22:21.651
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

22:31.228 --> 22:33.263
<i>You Blackbird?</i>

22:37.801 --> 22:39.302
<i>PARSONS: You know who I am?</i>

22:39.304 --> 22:43.573
<i>Yes. He explained
everything to me.</i>

22:43.575 --> 22:46.209
<i>PARSONS: Then you know your
friend didn't follow through on</i>

22:46.211 --> 22:47.477
<i>the deal he made with me.</i>

22:47.479 --> 22:48.478
<i>This is not true.</i>

22:48.480 --> 22:50.246
<i>You pay him, he provide data.</i>

22:50.248 --> 22:52.682
<i>PARSONS: No, I paid him and he
ran off with my money before</i>

22:52.684 --> 22:56.786
<i>he provided anything.</i>

22:56.788 --> 23:00.423
<i>How did you know I paid him?</i>

23:00.425 --> 23:04.127
<i>I s... I see your funds
come into his account.</i>

23:04.129 --> 23:06.162
<i>I monitor at home
everything, so</i>

23:06.164 --> 23:08.031
<i>to see nothing will go wrong.</i>

23:08.033 --> 23:10.366
<i>COOPER: So you have
access to his account?</i>

23:10.368 --> 23:12.435
<i>Not monies, just records.</i>

23:12.437 --> 23:16.439
<i>PARSONS: So you must know
if Patty Hewes paid him.</i>

23:16.441 --> 23:18.808
<i>She did.</i>

23:18.810 --> 23:20.944
<i>Yes, absolutely.</i>

23:20.946 --> 23:23.913
<i>She meet with him before
you meet with him.</i>

23:23.915 --> 23:27.150
<i>She...
pay him, he provide data.</i>

23:27.152 --> 23:28.918
<i>PARSONS: So if I didn't get</i>

23:28.920 --> 23:32.855
<i>the information, how do you
know that Patty Hewes did?</i>

23:32.857 --> 23:39.462
<i>He s... he send me confirmation
transaction was complete.</i>

23:39.464 --> 23:41.698
<i>Then Samurai meet with you.</i>

23:41.700 --> 23:46.369
<i>- You give him money, but...
PARSONS: - But what?</i>

23:46.371 --> 23:51.307
<i>I never hear from him again.</i>

23:51.309 --> 23:53.543
<i>PARSONS: So he ran
out on both of us?</i>

23:53.545 --> 23:55.011
<i>No, not run away.</i>

23:55.013 --> 23:57.146
<i>Not without laptop, hardware.</i>

23:57.148 --> 23:59.349
<i>Everything still here.</i>

23:59.351 --> 24:02.218
<i>(sighs) Something must
happened to him.</i>

24:02.220 --> 24:04.854
<i>PARSONS: This information he
sold Patty Hewes, do you know</i>

24:04.856 --> 24:06.422
<i>what that was?</i>

24:06.424 --> 24:11.527
<i>This he does not tell me.</i>

24:11.529 --> 24:15.331
<i>PARSONS (chuckles): Okay.</i>

24:15.333 --> 24:18.401
<i>I really need your help.</i>

24:27.278 --> 24:29.946
<i>Can I help you?</i>

24:29.948 --> 24:32.348
<i>McCLAREN: You're Jeff, right?</i>

24:32.350 --> 24:33.449
<i>JEFF: Who are you?</i>

24:33.451 --> 24:35.451
<i>McCLAREN: I'm a
friend of Sally's.</i>

24:35.453 --> 24:38.087
<i>I was... hoping we could talk.</i>

24:38.089 --> 24:39.422
<i>JEFF: About what?</i>

24:39.424 --> 24:40.423
<i>McCLAREN: Charlie.</i>

24:40.425 --> 24:43.092
<i>JEFF: You got a problem with
Charlie, talk to his mother.</i>

24:43.094 --> 24:45.395
<i>McCLAREN: I want to talk to you.</i>

24:45.397 --> 24:48.665
<i>I don't think you
understand Charlie.</i>

24:48.667 --> 24:49.666

<i>JEFF: Oh, really?</i>

24:50.802 --> 24:53.936
<i>McCLAREN: He thinks differently
than most people.</i>

24:53.938 --> 24:55.571
<i>He sees things differently.</i>

24:55.573 --> 24:56.739
<i>JEFF (laughs): No shit.</i>

24:56.741 --> 24:58.775
<i>There's something
wrong upstairs.</i>

24:58.777 --> 25:00.777
<i>McCLAREN: No, you
don't understand.</i>

25:00.779 --> 25:01.778
<i>There's nothing wrong.</i>

25:01.780 --> 25:04.981
<i>JEFF: Yeah, I-I've heard the
bullshit-- he's "special."</i>

25:04.983 --> 25:06.482
<i>So he acts like a
fucking moron.</i>

25:06.484 --> 25:09.118
<i>The kid can't talk
to people, okay?</i>

25:09.120 --> 25:10.787
<i>He's a freak.</i>

25:10.789 --> 25:13.456
<i>McCLAREN: He's not a freak.</i>

25:13.458 --> 25:15.258
<i>A kid like Charlie
will never be</i>

25:15.260 --> 25:17.794
<i>good with people, and that's
okay-- he'll be good at other</i>

25:17.796 --> 25:20.163
<i>things. Very good.</i>

25:20.165 --> 25:23.132
<i>He just needs...
a little patience.</i>

25:23.134 --> 25:25.134
<i>JEFF: That's the last
thing he needs.</i>

25:25.136 --> 25:28.371
<i>He is the way he is because Sally
lets him do whatever he wants.</i>

25:28.373 --> 25:29.372
<i>McCLAREN: No.</i>

25:29.374 --> 25:31.407
<i>JEFF: He needs discipline, okay?</i>

25:31.409 --> 25:32.575
<i>She can't give it to him.</i>

25:32.577 --> 25:33.876
<i>That's why she needs me around.</i>

25:33.878 --> 25:37.814
<i>McCLAREN: What you're
doing doesn't help.</i>

25:37.816 --> 25:42.085
<i>You're making things worse.</i>

25:42.087 --> 25:46.055
<i>I'd like you to be a little
more patient with him.</i>

25:48.158 --> 25:49.859
<i>Can you do that?</i>

25:49.861 --> 25:52.729
<i>JEFF: I'd like you to get
the fuck out of my face.</i>

25:52.731 --> 25:55.598
<i>McCLAREN: It's clear you
don't know who I am.</i>

25:55.600 --> 25:57.734
<i>I can do things to you, Jeff.</i>

25:57.736 --> 26:00.136
<i>I can get to you if I want to.</i>

26:00.138 --> 26:06.309
<i>(Jeff laughs)</i>

26:06.311 --> 26:08.311
<i>JEFF: Are you threatening me?</i>

26:08.313 --> 26:11.280
<i>'Cause it sounds like
you're threatening me.</i>

26:11.282 --> 26:14.417
<i>McCLAREN: I'm asking you nicely.</i>

26:14.419 --> 26:17.120
<i>Do not touch Charlie.</i>

26:17.122 --> 26:20.056
<i>You leave him alone,
I'll leave you alone.</i>

26:20.058 --> 26:22.992
<i>JEFF: You want me to
leave the kid alone?</i>

26:22.994 --> 26:27.563
<i>McCLAREN: That's all I'm asking.</i>

26:27.565 --> 26:29.132
<i>JEFF: Okay.</i>

26:29.134 --> 26:30.466
<i>(McClaren grunts)</i>

26:30.468 --> 26:32.101
<i>There's your answer.</i>

26:32.103 --> 26:34.737
<i>Now, get the fuck out of
here, you fucking faggot.</i>

26:34.739 --> 26:36.873
<i>MAGGIE: She's not in right now.</i>

26:36.875 --> 26:37.940
<i>HEWES: What's this?</i>

26:37.942 --> 26:39.308
<i>HERNDON: Discovery request.</i>

26:39.310 --> 26:42.712
<i>Parsons is demanding you hand
over the Samurai information.</i>

26:42.714 --> 26:44.847
<i>HEWES: So she didn't buy
it from him after all.</i>

26:44.849 --> 26:46.349
<i>HERNDON: No, guess not.</i>

26:46.351 --> 26:47.350
<i>HEWES: She lied.</i>

26:47.352 --> 26:51.554
<i>HERNDON: Now she's using the
court to make you cough it up.</i>

26:51.556 --> 26:52.622
<i>(clears throat)</i>

26:52.624 --> 26:55.057
<i>HEWES: Your Honor, I simply don't
have the information that</i>

26:55.059 --> 26:57.427
<i>Ms. Parsons is requesting.</i>

26:57.429 --> 26:59.028
<i>PARSONS: Ms. Hewes is lying.</i>

26:59.030 --> 27:00.263
<i>She bought the information for</i>

27:00.265 --> 27:02.565
<i>$500,000 from a computer hacker.</i>

27:02.567 --> 27:04.634
<i>GEARHEART: How do you know this?</i>

27:04.636 --> 27:07.870
<i>PARSONS: For starters, the same hacker
offered to sell the information to me.</i>

27:07.872 --> 27:09.939
<i>HEWES: That means
nothing, Your Honor.</i>

27:09.941 --> 27:12.942
<i>GEARHEART: Really, Ms. Parsons,
you're just tossing out accusations.</i>

27:12.944 --> 27:16.412
<i>You want me to help you,
you got to help me.</i>

27:16.414 --> 27:17.513
<i>PARSONS: Yes, Your Honor.</i>

27:17.515 --> 27:19.982
<i>GEARHEART: Is there anyone who
can attest to the validity</i>

27:19.984 --> 27:22.018
<i>of your claims?</i>

27:25.255 --> 27:26.622
<i>(door opens)</i>

27:26.624 --> 27:29.692
<i>PARSONS: Okay, you can come in.</i>

27:35.399 --> 27:37.900
<i>GEARHEART: And how do you know
the money was transferred</i>

27:37.902 --> 27:40.570
<i>from Ms. Hewes to
your boyfriend?</i>

27:40.572 --> 27:43.606
<i>I see it go into his account.</i>

27:43.608 --> 27:47.577
<i>GEARHEART: Why isn't your boyfriend
here to tell me this himself?</i>

27:47.579 --> 27:51.981
<i>PARSONS: He's missing, Your Honor,
since his meeting with Ms. Hewes.</i>

27:51.983 --> 27:54.250
<i>HEWES: Alleged</i> meeting.

27:54.252 --> 27:57.119
Your Honor, this is a very
colorful story, but hardly

27:57.121 --> 27:59.822
evidence that I
bought information.

27:59.824 --> 28:03.759
I have bank records.

28:03.761 --> 28:08.598
PARSONS: Here's a copy
of the transaction.

28:08.600 --> 28:12.835
The timing and amount of the
transfer back up Ms. Kim's story.

28:12.837 --> 28:16.138
And this is Ms. Kim's
sworn statement.

28:18.475 --> 28:21.143
GEARHEART (sighs): I'm not gonna
ask you if you have this

28:21.145 --> 28:27.116
Samurai information, Patty, because that
would just be awkward for both of us.

28:27.118 --> 28:33.389
But I am going to require that
you hand it over to Ms. Parsons.

28:33.391 --> 28:35.157
HEWES: One week.

28:35.159 --> 28:36.592
PARSONS: Today.

28:36.594 --> 28:38.261
HEWES: 72 hours.

28:38.263 --> 28:40.730
GEARHEART: Tomorrow morning.

28:40.732 --> 28:42.798
Good day, all.

28:45.269 --> 28:47.803
(labored breathing)

29:00.284 --> 29:04.220
(man coughing)

29:04.222 --> 29:06.289
FRANKLIN: Hi.

29:08.659 --> 29:11.127
Hey.

29:11.129 --> 29:14.964
They said you had
a rough night.

29:14.966 --> 29:16.399
How you doing today?

29:16.401 --> 29:20.436
Like a brittle pile of old cow
turds scorched by the sun

29:20.438 --> 29:22.338
and run over by a train!

29:22.340 --> 29:23.339
(coughing weakly)

29:23.341 --> 29:24.840
FRANKLIN: Oh, good.

29:24.842 --> 29:27.276
Better, then.

29:31.448 --> 29:34.784
They're trying to kill me.

29:34.786 --> 29:35.785
FRANKLIN: Who are?

29:35.787 --> 29:37.486
The fucking nurses!

29:37.488 --> 29:39.522
Every goddamn one of them!

29:39.524 --> 29:40.523
(coughing)

29:40.525 --> 29:44.260
FRANKLIN: I told you before,
getting angry just makes it worse.

29:44.262 --> 29:45.494
They want me dead!

29:45.496 --> 29:48.364
FRANKLIN: No, they are
trying to save your life.

29:48.366 --> 29:49.665
What's to save?

29:49.667 --> 29:51.601
I'll be dead in a month.

29:51.603 --> 29:54.003
What are they trying to prove?

29:54.005 --> 29:56.606
(panting)

30:00.811 --> 30:06.449
So... did you talk to her?

30:06.451 --> 30:08.217
FRANKLIN: Yeah.

30:08.219 --> 30:09.218
Well?

30:09.220 --> 30:11.621
FRANKLIN: I warned you when
you asked me to approach her

30:11.623 --> 30:14.056
that she probably
wouldn't be interested.

30:14.058 --> 30:16.759
And I was right-- she's not.

30:16.761 --> 30:19.362
Well, keep chipping away at her.

30:19.364 --> 30:23.699
She's not half as smart
as everybody thinks.

30:23.701 --> 30:26.202
FRANKLIN: All right.

30:26.204 --> 30:30.006
In the meantime,
I got you these.

30:30.008 --> 30:31.807
I don't read anymore.

30:31.809 --> 30:33.676
FRANKLIN: Suit yourself.

30:33.678 --> 30:38.080
But there is an article in <i>American
Lawyer...</i> that you may

30:38.082 --> 30:41.117
find particularly interesting.

30:44.287 --> 30:46.922
See ya.

30:46.924 --> 30:48.357
Try and behave.

30:48.359 --> 30:51.494
(man chuckles)

30:51.496 --> 30:53.729
(labored breathing)

31:05.108 --> 31:07.743
(chuckling)

31:09.680 --> 31:11.947
McCLAREN: Bottom line is, we
agreed to financial terms about

31:11.949 --> 31:13.916
nine years ago when
she got pregnant.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.951
I didn't want her to keep the
baby because I knew we weren't

31:15.953 --> 31:17.520
gonna be together long-term.

31:17.522 --> 31:20.056
PARSONS: And Sally was aware
of your position on this?

31:20.058 --> 31:22.391
McCLAREN: Couldn't have been
clearer; I was definitive.

31:22.393 --> 31:25.327
FRANKLIN: And has she abided
by her side of the agreement?

31:25.329 --> 31:26.328
McCLAREN: Yes.

31:26.330 --> 31:28.330
FRANKLIN: But now she
wants more money?

31:28.332 --> 31:29.331
McCLAREN: Yes.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.333
FRANKLIN: In exchange for what?

31:31.335 --> 31:33.335
McCLAREN: The money
isn't the issue.

31:33.337 --> 31:34.970
I can get her additional funds.

31:34.972 --> 31:38.140
It's her current boyfriend
that I'm pissed off about.

31:38.142 --> 31:40.142
PARSONS: Is he physically
abusing Charlie?

31:40.144 --> 31:42.378
McCLAREN: I want the guy
removed from the picture.

31:42.380 --> 31:45.815
He doesn't understand that
Charlie is a complicated kid.

31:45.817 --> 31:49.752
How can I make that happen?

31:49.754 --> 31:53.155
PARSONS: Well, legally, you
would need evidence that abuse

31:53.157 --> 31:56.292
is occurring, which, if it isn't
physical, can be very difficult

31:56.294 --> 31:59.161
to substantiate and take
several months to prove.

31:59.163 --> 32:02.331
McCLAREN: I want
the guy out today.

32:02.333 --> 32:05.468
PARSONS: Best thing to do is
be aggressive and start the

32:05.470 --> 32:07.837
process, but it
<i>will</i> be a process.

32:07.839 --> 32:09.972
McCLAREN: I don't
have time for that.

32:09.974 --> 32:12.074
PARSONS: Well...
legally, it's our only option.

32:12.076 --> 32:14.076
McCLAREN: You've
been very helpful.

32:14.078 --> 32:17.246
Thank you for your time.

32:17.248 --> 32:22.585
PARSONS: I'm sorry we can't...
tell you what you want to hear.

32:27.858 --> 32:28.824
HEWES: No, thank you.

32:28.826 --> 32:29.825
REINSDORF: You sure?

32:29.827 --> 32:31.827
HEWES: Just tell
me what you found.

32:31.829 --> 32:34.497
REINSDORF: Well, that's
the thing, Ms. Hewes.

32:34.499 --> 32:36.031
There's nothing.

32:36.033 --> 32:40.936
We have no record of Ms. Walling ever
having communicated with McClaren.

32:40.938 --> 32:42.938
HEWES: Do you spell Reinsdorf
with one "F" or two?

32:42.940 --> 32:44.440
REINSDORF: What are you doing?

32:44.442 --> 32:46.442
HEWES: I'm e-mailing my
friend at the <i>Times.</i>

32:46.444 --> 32:48.444
<i>REINSDORF: Oh, whoa, wait-wait,
stop, stop, please.</i>

32:48.446 --> 32:49.945
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

32:49.947 --> 32:52.481
<i>What...
what do you want from me, huh?</i>

32:52.483 --> 32:53.616
<i>I mean, I tried.</i>

32:53.618 --> 32:55.417
<i>There is nothing in the Walling</i>

32:55.419 --> 33:00.022
<i>investigation that
will help your case.</i>

33:00.024 --> 33:05.060
<i>HEWES: Maybe we're looking at the
problem from the wrong angle.</i>

33:05.062 --> 33:06.595
<i>Maybe you've got something that</i>

33:06.597 --> 33:09.431
<i>would help my opponent's case.</i>

33:09.433 --> 33:11.600
<i>REINSDORF: Such as?</i>

33:11.602 --> 33:13.769
<i>HEWES: In your investigation,</i>

33:13.771 --> 33:16.539
<i>did you ever turn up anyone who</i>

33:16.541 --> 33:20.442
<i>may have wanted to
hurt Naomi Walling?</i>

33:20.444 --> 33:25.648
<i>Who may have been motivated
to expose her personal life?</i>

33:25.650 --> 33:28.818
<i>REINSDORF: I'd have
to go back and look.</i>

33:28.820 --> 33:31.187
<i>HEWES: Do that.</i>

33:31.189 --> 33:33.522
<i>You have 24 hours.</i>

33:33.524 --> 33:36.592
<i>After that, I make the call.</i>

33:43.934 --> 33:45.968
<i>(elevator bell dings)</i>

33:48.638 --> 33:51.740
<i>(horn blaring, siren wailing)</i>

33:51.742 --> 33:54.143
<i>(jackhammer drilling)</i>

34:02.619 --> 34:07.289
<i>(distant barking)</i>

34:07.291 --> 34:09.525
<i>(barking)</i>

34:09.527 --> 34:12.594
<i>(Parsons gasps)</i>

34:23.907 --> 34:26.942
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

34:30.246 --> 34:31.679
<i>(sniffles)</i>

34:31.681 --> 34:33.114
<i>HEWES: Hello.</i>

34:33.117 --> 34:35.016
<i>PARSONS: Hello, Patty.</i>

34:35.018 --> 34:38.420
<i>Is it wine or Bourbon tonight?</i>

34:38.422 --> 34:39.487
<i>HEWES: Wine.</i>

34:39.489 --> 34:42.157
<i>PARSONS: Well, I
wanted to touch base.</i>

34:42.159 --> 34:45.427
<i>Tomorrow's the deadline for
handing over the information to</i>

34:45.429 --> 34:48.429
<i>me, not that you need reminding.</i>

34:48.431 --> 34:50.966
<i>HEWES: No, of course not.</i>

34:50.967 --> 34:52.134
<i>PARSONS: I'm just calling to</i>

34:52.136 --> 34:55.271
<i>ask if I could get a hard
copy, as well as the disk.</i>

34:55.273 --> 34:56.772
<i>HEWES: Anything you want.</i>

34:56.774 --> 34:58.240
<i>PARSONS: That would be great.</i>

34:58.242 --> 35:00.976
<i>And Patty, if for some reason
you decide not to comply with</i>

35:00.978 --> 35:05.614
<i>the judge's order, I have a motion for
summary judgment all ready to go.</i>

35:05.616 --> 35:08.584
<i>HEWES: You'll have the
information, Ellen.</i>

35:08.586 --> 35:11.720
<i>Have a good night.</i>

35:20.897 --> 35:23.432
<i>HERNDON: Sorry I'm late, Judge.</i>

35:23.434 --> 35:26.135
<i>The three train must have
been stuck in molasses.</i>

35:26.137 --> 35:27.136
<i>GEARHEART: That's okay.</i>

35:27.138 --> 35:28.270
<i>Have a seat.</i>

35:28.272 --> 35:31.840
<i>I'll be right with you both.</i>

35:31.842 --> 35:34.476
<i>HERNDON: Still scrambling
for a defense, are you?</i>

35:34.478 --> 35:37.079
<i>Well, too bad, Toots, 'cause
there's nothing in there.</i>

35:37.081 --> 35:40.549
<i>PARSONS: It's funny that Patty
would lie about having it then.</i>

35:40.551 --> 35:42.718
<i>HERNDON: Well, it cost
her half a mill.</i>

35:42.720 --> 35:44.486
<i>Must have felt proprietary.</i>

35:44.488 --> 35:49.358
<i>Anyway, lots of luck.</i>

35:49.360 --> 35:53.228
<i>PARSONS: I'm sure it'll make
for interesting reading.</i>

35:53.230 --> 35:57.299
<i>GEARHEART: So...
you've brought everything that</i>

35:57.301 --> 35:59.201
<i>Ms. Hewes procured
from this hacker?</i>

35:59.203 --> 36:00.536
<i>HERNDON: You betcha, Judge.</i>

36:00.538 --> 36:03.405
<i>Here's a copy of the disk.</i>

36:03.407 --> 36:05.274
<i>And these are the files.</i>

Ms. Parsons?</i>

36:15.886 --> 36:16.885
<i>PARSONS: Yes, Your Honor.</i>

36:16.887 --> 36:18.887
<i>Satisfied.</i>

<i>PARSONS: Samurai's documents
clearly indicate that</i>

37:14.645 --> 37:16.945
<i>Princefield and Herreshoff were
investigating Naomi Walling.</i>

37:16.947 --> 37:19.415
<i>SIMON: Why would Patty Hewes
lie about having this?</i>

37:19.417 --> 37:21.917
<i>I mean, what good
does it do her?</i>

37:21.919 --> 37:23.285
<i>PARSONS: Knowledge is power.</i>

37:23.287 --> 37:25.788
<i>The question is, where does
this information lead?</i>

37:25.790 --> 37:28.791
<i>SIMON: If Princefield was
investigating Naomi prior to the</i>

find out about her?</i>

37:32.263 --> 37:33.395
<i>PARSONS: Exactly.</i>

37:33.397 --> 37:36.465
<i>I'm going to look into that.</i>

37:39.302 --> 37:44.306
<i>REINSDORF: Well, this is of no
concern to me, Ms. Parsons.</i>

37:44.308 --> 37:48.143
<i>Our investigation of Naomi Walling
followed standard protocol.</i>

37:48.145 --> 37:50.679
<i>We dotted every "I,"
we crossed every "T."</i>

37:50.681 --> 37:54.950
<i>PARSONS: Patty Hewes approached
you already, didn't she?</i>

37:54.952 --> 37:57.386

sort of arrangement?</i>

<i>Always some conspiracy.</i>

<i>PARSONS: No, there's only one
reason Patty wouldn't have</i>

38:05.796 --> 38:08.030
<i>leaked this information
to the press.</i>

38:08.032 --> 38:11.233
<i>REINSDORF: Whatever it is you're
implying, I don't appreciate it.</i>

38:11.235 --> 38:12.668
<i>PARSONS: You cut a deal.</i>

38:12.670 --> 38:14.169
<i>She sat on the information, and</i>

38:14.171 --> 38:17.039
<i>you helped her with her case.</i>

38:17.041 --> 38:19.341
<i>REINSDORF: You are way off base.</i>

38:19.343 --> 38:23.312
<i>Yes, Ms. Hewes did approach me.</i>

38:25.448 --> 38:28.484
<i>And I explained it to her
like I'll explain it to you.</i>

38:28.486 --> 38:31.420
<i>The S.E.C.'s investigation
is ongoing.</i>

38:31.422 --> 38:34.656

action against Naomi Walling</i>

<i>McCLAREN: Should be
enough for a while.</i>

39:20.905 --> 39:24.806
<i>And I want you to put Charlie
in the right kind of school.</i>

school right now.</i>

matters to me.</i>

40:01.212 --> 40:02.211
<i>NAOMI: You're married.</i>

40:02.213 --> 40:05.447
<i>Did you really think that I wouldn't
start seeing someone else?</i>

40:05.449 --> 40:07.583
<i>HERRESHOFF: Do not
fuck with me, Naomi.</i>

40:07.585 --> 40:09.585

<i>HEWES: Naomi Walling was having a
relationship with Herreshoff.</i>

40:19.063 --> 40:21.964
<i>REINSDORF: And it sounds
like it didn't end well.</i>

40:21.966 --> 40:24.433
<i>HEWES: Do you have any other
conversations between them?</i>

40:24.435 --> 40:28.337
<i>REINSDORF: No.
This is the only one we picked up.</i>

40:28.339 --> 40:29.671
<i>I think you'll agree that I've</i>

40:29.673 --> 40:31.773
<i>given you everything
you asked for.</i>

40:31.775 --> 40:34.209
<i>This call is a silver
bullet for Ellen Parsons.</i>

40:34.211 --> 40:36.745
<i>She gets her hands on
it, your case is sunk.</i>

40:36.747 --> 40:39.047
<i>HEWES: Then she
better not hear it.</i>

40:39.049 --> 40:40.282
<i>REINSDORF: Oh, she won't.</i>

40:40.284 --> 40:44.586
<i>I deleted the call
from our records.</i>

40:44.588 --> 40:50.392
<i>And I'm leaving the
only copy with you.</i>

40:50.394 --> 40:53.128

running the story.

40:57.268 --> 41:02.137
HEWES: No, he won't.

41:02.139 --> 41:08.210
Your total incompetence will
remain just between us.

41:10.947 --> 41:13.849
CHARLIE: Your friend
is very late.

41:13.851 --> 41:16.852
SALLY: Yes, he is.

41:16.854 --> 41:21.657
CHARLIE: When is your
friend gonna be here?

41:21.659 --> 41:23.725
SALLY: Soon, baby.

41:23.727 --> 41:27.796
Soon.

41:30.566 --> 41:32.501
(phone ringing)

41:32.503 --> 41:35.203
(woman moans)

41:35.205 --> 41:40.742
You're not going to
answer that, are you?

41:43.946 --> 41:46.748
(phone line ringing)

41:59.128 --> 42:03.298
McCLAREN: The other day,
you asked me a question.

42:07.637 --> 42:11.206
The answer is yes.

42:11.208 --> 42:16.945
There is something
wrong with me.

42:23.820 --> 42:28.423
(horn honking, siren wailing)

42:38.067 --> 42:42.170
(dog barking)

(gasps)

42:57.620 --> 43:00.655
(man panting)

43:18.908 --> 43:23.612
I was told you wanted
nothing to do with me.

43:23.614 --> 43:27.616
HEWES: I don't.

43:27.618 --> 43:30.352
Then why are you here?

43:30.354 --> 43:34.723
HEWES: I heard you were dying.

43:34.725 --> 43:38.460
So you wanted to come and
see what that looks like.

43:38.462 --> 43:41.530
(man chuckles)

43:49.839 --> 43:52.874
Boy.

43:56.612 --> 44:00.415
You look so much
like your mother.

44:00.417 --> 44:02.684
HEWES: Don't talk
about my mother.

44:02.686 --> 44:06.488
I don't mean to trample
on sacred ground.

44:06.490 --> 44:13.462
I know you two were
devoted to each other.

44:13.464 --> 44:17.799
'Course, she was always
easy to boonswaggle.

44:17.801 --> 44:18.800
(laughs)

44:18.802 --> 44:30.245
Never really... had a clear... idea of
what kind of a person... you really are.

44:30.247 --> 44:37.486
HEWES: Well, she certainly knew what
kind of person <i>you really are.</i>

44:38.988 --> 44:41.656
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

44:41.658 --> 44:46.761
<i>What if I told you, I
put you in my will?</i>

44:46.763 --> 44:52.334
<i>HEWES: I'd tell you
to take me out.</i>

44:53.603 --> 44:57.639
<i>Is that all?</i>

45:11.120 --> 45:18.093
<i>Don't you ever</i>
try to contact me again.
