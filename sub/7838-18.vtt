00:48.079 --> 00:49.579
Call the police.

00:51.900 --> 00:54.453
I need change for a dollar.

00:54.703 --> 00:56.450
No change without purchase.

00:56.700 --> 00:59.968
What's the cheapest thing you've got?

01:00.218 --> 01:01.953
A two-ounce bag of chips.

01:02.203 --> 01:03.820
$5.99.

01:04.069 --> 01:05.306
$5.99?!

01:05.556 --> 01:06.650
What a rip-off!

01:06.900 --> 01:09.059
Someone should shoot you!

01:09.509 --> 01:11.950
I was hoping we'd miss the 3:00 holdup.

01:12.201 --> 01:13.859
I don't know what to do for dinner now.

01:14.100 --> 01:15.551
Maybe we could shop somewhere else.

01:15.808 --> 01:18.105
There's a farm stand next door.

01:21.218 --> 01:22.103
Interesting.

01:22.353 --> 01:24.867
It's like a corn dog without the dog.

01:25.117 --> 01:27.956
Put whatever you want in this burlap sack.

01:28.406 --> 01:29.450
You may not.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.700
That's my baby carrier.

01:33.079 --> 01:37.329
They so traumatized, I'm takin'
them for a walk in they stroller.

01:43.503 --> 01:46.150
Well, I think this family
should try more vegetarian meals.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.208
We'd feel better and live longer.

01:48.458 --> 01:53.008
Vegetables, you've been promoted
from side dish to entree.

01:58.153 --> 01:59.467
I don't miss meat at all.

01:59.717 --> 02:01.806
This portobello mushroom eats like a steak.

02:02.056 --> 02:05.706
A rubbery, fungus-like steak.

02:08.699 --> 02:11.650
Marge, I'm giving birth to a food baby.

02:14.079 --> 02:16.850
I feel like something crawled
inside me and took a crap.

02:17.100 --> 02:19.150
Bart, don't use that word...

02:19.803 --> 02:21.153
Crap.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.468
I brought you some weak tea and dry toast.

02:34.718 --> 02:35.443
No fair.

02:35.693 --> 02:36.767
Lisa didn't get sick.

02:37.017 --> 02:39.259
It's 'cause your bodies are
so used to processed food,

02:39.509 --> 02:41.850
it's a shock when you eat
vegetables full of vitamins,

02:42.100 --> 02:44.800
minerals and trace amounts of bug feces.

02:49.303 --> 02:51.750
I think it's staying down.

02:52.800 --> 02:54.400
It's staying down.

02:55.618 --> 02:56.903
It's not staying down.

02:57.153 --> 02:57.567
Wait.

02:57.817 --> 02:59.356
Yup, it's staying down.

02:59.606 --> 03:01.050
Oh, no, it's not.

03:01.300 --> 03:02.159
Yes, it is.

03:02.409 --> 03:03.350
No, it's not.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.853
Yup. No. Yup. No.

03:06.103 --> 03:06.750
Yup. No.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.168
Yup, no, yup, no, yup, no.

03:08.418 --> 03:09.553
Stop it.

03:09.803 --> 03:11.767
You'll all feel better if
you get a little sleep.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.717
Now, close your eyes.

03:19.556 --> 03:21.106
Where's my bucket?

03:22.400 --> 03:25.350
Hush, little baby, don't say a word

03:25.600 --> 03:29.029
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird.

03:29.279 --> 03:33.429
And if that mockingbird don't sing

03:36.879 --> 03:38.550
and if that diamond ring

03:38.800 --> 03:43.253
turns brass Mama's gonna
buy you a looking glass...

03:43.503 --> 03:47.650
Lisa sings so sweetly,
and Bart is my pillow.

03:47.900 --> 03:50.000
Everyone's good for something.

03:56.518 --> 03:57.903
Looks like you guys are on the mend.

03:58.153 --> 03:59.867
Yeah, 'cause we're through with vegetables.

04:00.117 --> 04:03.467
>From now on, I'm only eating
food that I know had a soul.

04:05.356 --> 04:06.350
Hey, hey, kids.

04:06.600 --> 04:09.159
Do you have what it takes
to be a singing sensation?

04:09.409 --> 04:10.350
A dynamite voice?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.353
Ruthless, pushy parents?

04:12.603 --> 04:16.550
A void in your self-esteem that
can only be filled by applause?

04:16.800 --> 04:18.668
Oh, God, I know that void.

04:18.918 --> 04:19.803
Then you were born to

04:20.053 --> 04:23.767
enter Krusty's L'il Starmaker
Singing Competition.

04:24.017 --> 04:25.106
Not affiliated with American Idol.

04:25.356 --> 04:27.059
We've never even heard of American Idol.

04:27.309 --> 04:31.150
The winner will be animated into
an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon.

04:31.400 --> 04:33.450
So enter today, especially if you're a

04:33.700 --> 04:36.753
funny-looking kid who doesn't know he sucks.

04:37.003 --> 04:39.053
I'm-a comin', Krusty.

04:39.900 --> 04:41.068
Lisa, you should enter that contest.

04:41.318 --> 04:42.503
You've got a great voice.

04:42.753 --> 04:43.767
It made us all feel better.

04:44.017 --> 04:44.866
Thanks, Bart.

04:45.116 --> 04:46.716
That's really sweet.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.800
I think I puked up all of my meanness.

04:52.079 --> 04:52.750
Praise the Lord!

04:53.000 --> 04:54.750
I'm on the road to recovery.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.550
I hope we didn't camp
out here for nothing.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.168
It's like every kid in Springfield showed up.

05:07.418 --> 05:10.503
Don't worry about the competition, sweetie.

05:10.753 --> 05:15.867
Whenever I enter a contest,
I tell myself I'm going to win

05:16.117 --> 05:22.206
because sometimes, if you believe
hard enough, God cuts you a break.

05:22.456 --> 05:24.150
After all, He works for us.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.159
Our prayers pay His salary.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.659
And if I win, I'll be on Itchy and Scratchy.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.753
Ah-ha,  en garde.

05:32.003 --> 05:33.403
Parry, thrust.

05:35.000 --> 05:37.050
Nicely done, Wind-dancer.

05:39.818 --> 05:43.203
But seriously, cruelty to
animals is no laughing matter.

05:43.453 --> 05:45.167
You can make a difference.

05:45.417 --> 05:46.906
Spay and neuter your pets.

05:47.156 --> 05:50.256
And remember, save the violence for cartoons.

05:55.600 --> 05:58.500
For details, log onto PETA.org.

06:06.209 --> 06:08.350
All right, kids, let's do this quick.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.753
After this, I got to record 27 seasons

06:11.003 --> 06:14.050
of DVD commentaries, and I remember nothing.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.368
Today, we'll pick the lucky children
who will get to compete on the air.

06:17.618 --> 06:19.603
I was going to be your celebrity judge,

06:19.853 --> 06:22.767
but then I realized I'd have to pay attention.

06:23.017 --> 06:25.217
So instead, we'll use the Applause-O-Meter.

06:26.556 --> 06:29.106
Now, let's get this over with!

06:34.339 --> 06:37.389
A-B-C-D-E-F-G

06:38.600 --> 06:40.900
How I wonder what you are.

06:41.603 --> 06:42.853
Thank you.

06:46.200 --> 06:48.208
I can't believe I used to date him.

06:48.458 --> 06:50.308
Lis, you're a shoo-in.

06:52.853 --> 06:58.967
Hush, little baby, don't say a word
Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird

06:59.217 --> 07:04.967
That's gonna sing, yes, it is, y'all

07:10.056 --> 07:12.950
And if that mockingbird don't sing

07:13.400 --> 07:16.159
Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring

07:16.409 --> 07:18.650
That's gonna shine.

07:18.900 --> 07:20.353
Shine

07:20.603 --> 07:22.903
Oh, it shines so bright.

07:30.500 --> 07:35.268
Lisa,  that sounds like a fancier version
of the song you're going to sing.

07:35.518 --> 07:40.118
And she's giving us the
emotional experience of a lifetime.

07:42.053 --> 07:45.053
Oh, thank you for this angel, Lord.

08:00.556 --> 08:02.150
This contest is moot.

08:02.400 --> 08:06.159
A Li'l Star has been made.

08:06.409 --> 08:09.350
When she sings a "C," it's a "C."

08:09.600 --> 08:12.153
Unlike a certain glee club
I've wasted my life on.

08:12.403 --> 08:14.850
I may not know much, but I do know talent

08:15.100 --> 08:17.068
when my producers point it out to me.

08:17.318 --> 08:19.053
We have our first contestant:

08:19.303 --> 08:21.453
Clarissa Wellington!

08:22.617 --> 08:24.906
There's no way I'm going to beat her.

08:25.156 --> 08:28.456
Why? Just because she sings like
Whitney Houston brought to life?

08:28.800 --> 08:29.969
Don't lose hope, sweetie.

08:30.219 --> 08:32.450
I'm going to write you a
song so great, you can't lose.

08:32.700 --> 08:34.253
And that's not just the beer talking.

08:34.503 --> 08:36.503
Your father's in here, too.

08:42.700 --> 08:46.568
When a man loves a woman...

08:46.918 --> 08:48.453
Which one are you, the man or the woman?

08:48.703 --> 08:50.267
Questioning the kid's sexuality--

08:50.517 --> 08:52.017
well done.

08:57.156 --> 08:57.859
Here you go, honey.

08:58.109 --> 08:58.550
Sing this.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.253
How did you write a song so quickly?

09:00.503 --> 09:01.650
Much of the tune is plagiarized.

09:01.901 --> 09:03.359
Now go, go, go.

09:06.410 --> 09:11.701
I've been to Paris and London and Tokyo town

09:11.958 --> 09:16.555
But one crazy burg has 'em all beat hands down...

09:19.017 --> 09:19.756
Jacksonville?

09:20.006 --> 09:23.050
I'm talkin' Springfield.
You can buy chimichangas

09:23.300 --> 09:24.979
Talkin' Springfield

09:25.229 --> 09:26.850
The chicks have big gazongas?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.853
There's tires on fire

09:29.103 --> 09:31.650
A guy named Apu

09:31.900 --> 09:33.168
And Skinner, and Grandpa

09:33.418 --> 09:35.068
And ol' Disco Stu.

09:35.853 --> 09:37.667
Did I forget to mention you?

09:37.917 --> 09:39.106
You?! That's me!

09:39.356 --> 09:41.906
I'm talkin' Springfield

09:42.156 --> 09:45.606
where nobody sucks.

09:47.900 --> 09:49.700
Except for Flanders.

09:56.479 --> 09:57.450
I get it, I get it.

09:57.700 --> 09:58.553
She's good.

09:58.803 --> 10:02.750
Looks like they love you, kid,
and the audience is always right.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.000
I wish I could say the
same about my stockbroker.

10:10.018 --> 10:11.503
Ah, what do you jerks know?

10:11.753 --> 10:13.753
That's a quality joke.

10:15.517 --> 10:16.706
You did it, sweetie.

10:16.956 --> 10:18.550
No, we did it, Dad.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.729
She's right, it was all me.

10:20.979 --> 10:23.100
I really do like working with you, Dad.

10:23.350 --> 10:24.653
Will you keep helping me?

10:24.903 --> 10:26.350
Of course, sweetie.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.308
You and I are going to write and sing our way

10:28.558 --> 10:31.753
out of this godforsaken hellhole.

10:32.003 --> 10:34.467
But your song said you liked Springfield.

10:34.717 --> 10:37.117
I wrote it about Shelbyville,
then changed the names.

10:44.756 --> 10:45.829
Good job, sweetie.

10:46.079 --> 10:50.029
Every time you hit that note,
I'll shoot a glass with my BB gun.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.353
I really appreciate your taking
such an interest in me, Dad.

10:53.603 --> 10:56.250
Honey, our time together is precious to me.

10:56.500 --> 10:57.768
I didn't want to say anything,

10:58.018 --> 11:00.803
but I don't think I'm going
to be around much longer.

11:01.053 --> 11:02.267
Really? What's wrong?

11:02.517 --> 11:06.106
Well, Moe's getting a big
screen TV in February,

11:06.356 --> 11:08.250
just in time for the Pro Bowl.

11:08.500 --> 11:11.550
Maybe this time my beloved blue shirts will win.

11:17.119 --> 11:19.050
Is it possible to get a green spotlight?

11:19.300 --> 11:20.753
Sorry, sweetie, we don't have green.

11:21.003 --> 11:23.253
Let Daddy go talk to the man.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.800
May I have a word with you?

11:34.318 --> 11:35.803
Is that green enough for you, sweetie?

11:36.053 --> 11:38.067
Cause I can make it greener.

11:38.317 --> 11:39.717
No, it's fine.

11:42.356 --> 11:47.150
Alas, my love. You do me wrong

11:47.400 --> 11:52.750
To cast me off discourteously....

11:55.179 --> 11:55.850
That's Cameron.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.753
Girls go crazy over him.

11:58.003 --> 12:03.053
He's cute, unthreatening, and his
smile brought a puppy back to life.

12:06.200 --> 12:06.968
Don't worry, honey.

12:07.218 --> 12:09.253
The  song I wrote you is so schmaltzy,

12:09.503 --> 12:13.603
it'll make "Moon River" sound
like a farting orangutan.

12:14.017 --> 12:19.806
My  kitty died on Christmas Eve

12:20.056 --> 12:25.106
Daddy told me to be brave

12:26.200 --> 12:31.059
But instead of singing carols I was digging

12:31.309 --> 12:34.359
Snowball's grave...

12:38.400 --> 12:41.450
God, I miss Lisa's cat so much.

12:43.003 --> 12:44.250
All right, you know how it works.

12:44.500 --> 12:46.768
Every week, we eliminate
one contestant based

12:47.018 --> 12:49.553
on the votes cast by you,the audience.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.967
Disclaimer: All ballots were
lost and vote totals made up.

12:52.217 --> 12:55.467
The first contestant eliminated is...
Katie Anderson.

12:59.706 --> 13:03.359
Katie, you were the first victim
of the Buzz Cola trapdoor.

13:03.609 --> 13:06.059
Fall into the flavor hole!

13:18.700 --> 13:22.053
And the next contestant to be eliminated is...

13:22.303 --> 13:23.753
Clarissa.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.568
Yeah,  it's you, honey.

13:26.818 --> 13:28.303
Please don't cry.

13:28.553 --> 13:29.167
Keep crying.

13:29.417 --> 13:30.767
It's dynamite.

13:32.856 --> 13:35.906
Sweetie, tonight, you were perfect.

13:36.600 --> 13:39.959
Marge, Lisa and I were just discussing
how to improve tonight's performance.

13:40.209 --> 13:42.750
Now you're confusing her by
telling her she was perfect.

13:43.000 --> 13:47.353
Mr. Simpson, I brought those
Twizzlers you asked for.

13:47.603 --> 13:49.550
My little girl likes Red Vines!

13:49.800 --> 13:51.050
You little...!

13:53.118 --> 13:55.053
Mr. Simpson, please stop!

13:55.303 --> 13:56.867
You think I can't kill you?

13:57.117 --> 13:59.056
There's a hundred little punks graduating

13:59.306 --> 14:01.850
from Syracuse this year that
would beg to kiss my ass.

14:02.100 --> 14:02.629
Let go.

14:02.879 --> 14:04.329
Get out of here.

14:04.800 --> 14:05.953
He's crazy.

14:06.203 --> 14:08.050
Hey, these are Red Vines.

14:08.300 --> 14:09.468
Here you go, sweetie.

14:09.718 --> 14:11.618
Daddy got you your candy.

14:12.953 --> 14:17.967
Homie, I'm worried you're turning into
some kind of super-cuckoo stage mother.

14:18.217 --> 14:20.906
Yeah. For once, couldn't you
just turn into a good father?

14:21.156 --> 14:22.750
Would that be so hard?

14:23.000 --> 14:24.329
Hey, give me a break.

14:24.579 --> 14:27.350
Living through Lisa is the healthiest
thing that ever happened to me.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.150
But, Dad, you don't need to
help me by humiliating people.

14:32.503 --> 14:35.450
You love sausage, but you
hate to see it getting made.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.968
I don't love sausage.

14:37.218 --> 14:39.368
Then would you like to see it getting made?

14:40.553 --> 14:41.803
Dad...

14:42.053 --> 14:43.403
you're fired.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.567
Fired? Me?

14:49.300 --> 14:52.300
Everything I did, I did for you.

15:00.479 --> 15:03.950
Dad, I'm sorry you're hurt,
but you left me no choice.

15:04.200 --> 15:07.853
You were obnoxious at a level not
even permitted in show business.

15:08.103 --> 15:09.850
Do you know the hours I worked?

15:10.100 --> 15:11.668
The people I had to yell at?

15:11.918 --> 15:13.753
The tires I had to slash?

15:14.003 --> 15:16.667
No one asked you to yell and slash!

15:16.917 --> 15:18.556
It's called schmoozing!

15:18.806 --> 15:20.250
Bart, you want to go to the video arcade?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.650
Hell, I'll even go shoe shopping.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.050
Hey, come back!

15:25.300 --> 15:27.353
I'm calming down!

15:27.603 --> 15:29.150
We'll have family fun!

15:29.400 --> 15:30.950
Family fun!

15:41.018 --> 15:43.153
Hey, everybody, I brought a guest.

15:43.403 --> 15:46.953
Someone who appreciates my
in-your-face management style.

15:49.217 --> 15:50.006
Smart move.

15:50.256 --> 15:53.350
Soon the whole world will be
lining up to suck my nose.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.559
After I make my new client a star.

15:56.809 --> 16:00.759
Hey, Simpson family.

16:01.600 --> 16:03.853
How can I touch your hearts tonight?

16:04.103 --> 16:05.950
You're working with Cameron now?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.768
His name isn't Cameron anymore.

16:08.018 --> 16:09.953
He's now "Johnny Rainbow."

16:10.203 --> 16:11.806
Mr. Simpson, about that...

16:12.056 --> 16:12.650
I'm not Mr. Simpson.

16:12.900 --> 16:14.600
That ship has sailed.

16:14.979 --> 16:16.350
I'm Colonel Cool.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.953
And I'm the captain on this rocket to the stars.

16:20.203 --> 16:21.900
So, are you a colonel or a captain?

16:22.150 --> 16:23.650
Neither. I'm both.

16:26.018 --> 16:26.403
All right,

16:26.653 --> 16:29.403
I wanna teach you a little
something about jazz hands.

16:32.817 --> 16:35.259
Now don't stop till it's
as natural as breathing.

16:35.509 --> 16:36.950
Dad looks so happy.

16:37.200 --> 16:39.853
Actually, I think your father's still upset

16:40.103 --> 16:42.703
about the way things went down.

16:43.600 --> 16:45.068
Marge. Bart.

16:45.318 --> 16:47.368
Maggie. Santa's Little Helper.

16:49.053 --> 16:49.367
Lisa.

16:49.617 --> 16:52.906
Dad, I don't want things to be awful between us.

16:53.156 --> 16:55.550
I made you some cookies.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.959
I don't think cookies are
going to make me feel better.

17:00.009 --> 17:01.709
Oh. Oh, God.

17:02.100 --> 17:04.002
They're delicious.

17:04.502 --> 17:06.403
Oh, I'm so happy.

17:07.099 --> 17:08.867
Oh, God, they're...

17:09.117 --> 17:10.867
They're gone.

17:14.353 --> 17:14.767
Hi.

17:15.017 --> 17:16.606
This lighting's a little bright.

17:16.856 --> 17:19.900
And , could I get a red
wash in the background?

17:20.150 --> 17:21.429
Sorry, hon, this is all we got.

17:21.679 --> 17:22.349
Who's next?

17:22.599 --> 17:22.953
We are.

17:23.203 --> 17:26.750
Okay Morty, gimme a rose-colored
spot, tight to mid-chest

17:27.000 --> 17:30.468
and an aqua background with
an astronaut on a surfboard.

17:30.618 --> 17:32.318
Sure thing, Mr. S.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.523
Lisa, at the end of your song,

17:41.017 --> 17:43.706
remember to look into the spotlight.

17:43.956 --> 17:46.006
It makes your eyes twinkle.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.059
Thanks, Dad.

17:48.309 --> 17:49.309
You're welcome.

17:56.400 --> 17:57.253
This is our final night.

17:57.503 --> 18:01.453
30 contestants have already fallen
through our Buzz Cola trapdoor.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.550
Let us out.

18:06.018 --> 18:09.318
Hey, you're supposed to
clean this out every night.

18:09.953 --> 18:13.003
What do you mean, talk to
your shop steward?

18:13.817 --> 18:16.756
Now let's welcome the first
of our two finalists,

18:17.006 --> 18:18.906
Lisa Simpson.

18:20.979 --> 18:23.250
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have a confession to make.

18:23.500 --> 18:26.153
I didn't have my usual songwriter tonight.

18:26.403 --> 18:29.050
So I took a stab at writing my own song.

18:29.300 --> 18:32.368
Something that expresses
what's really in my heart.

18:33.118 --> 18:34.553
Bernie, if you please.

18:34.903 --> 18:39.967
I'm in the final two I should be happy.

18:40.217 --> 18:47.617
But all I want to do is
spend more time with my pappy

18:49.456 --> 18:51.650
Now that you're gone, Dad

18:51.900 --> 18:57.329
I miss you so much and your
threats against teamsters

18:57.579 --> 19:02.250
And techies and such your management style

19:02.500 --> 19:05.053
is like Attila the Hun.

19:05.503 --> 19:08.350
You were vicious, malicious.

19:08.600 --> 19:11.768
But you got the job done.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.003
I'm sorry I hurt you.

19:15.253 --> 19:17.767
But please don't be sad.

19:18.017 --> 19:20.806
You're no longer my coach.

19:21.056 --> 19:26.106
But you're always my dad.

19:35.100 --> 19:38.350
Even the Applause-O-Meter is crying.

19:39.229 --> 19:41.879
Oh, God, that's battery acid.

19:42.700 --> 19:45.653
Dad, you know the best part
about this whole thing

19:45.903 --> 19:47.850
has been the time we've spent together.

19:48.100 --> 19:49.968
I don't care if I win, just as long

19:50.218 --> 19:51.803
as you're in my corner again.

19:52.053 --> 19:53.567
I always was, honey.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.467
Look. Cameron's about to sing
the song I wrote for him.

19:58.116 --> 20:01.850
He's about to learn the most important
lesson in the music business:

20:02.100 --> 20:05.350
Don't trust people in the music business.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.650
I'm a privileged boy.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.153
It's great, I gotta tell ya.

20:09.403 --> 20:10.350
A privileged boy.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.068
My dad can buy and sell ya.

20:12.318 --> 20:13.253
It really doesn't matter.

20:13.503 --> 20:14.967
That you're on the list in front of me.

20:15.217 --> 20:16.106
I'm gonna get your table.

20:16.356 --> 20:17.829
Cause I always tip the maitre d'

20:18.079 --> 20:19.150
And then I'll go to Yale.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.053
Because I am a legacy.

20:21.303 --> 20:23.503
I'm better than you.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.368
You suck, Johnny Rainbow.

20:29.618 --> 20:31.318
I believed in you.

20:35.613 --> 20:38.067
You sabotaged Cameron for me.

20:38.317 --> 20:38.806
Sure did.

20:39.056 --> 20:40.850
I'd do anything for you, honey.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.359
Especially if it's easy.

20:43.609 --> 20:47.159
Well, I think you're the sweetest
dad in the whole world.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.653
I'll always be there.

20:50.903 --> 20:53.253
Not even death will stop me.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.368
Now you're getting creepy.

20:55.618 --> 20:57.863
How 'bout I love you, honey.

20:58.113 --> 20:59.763
Good.
