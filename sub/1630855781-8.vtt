03:04.280 --> 03:05.160
Surprise!

03:05.160 --> 03:06.320
Oh no!

03:06.320 --> 03:07.799
Oh no! No!

03:20.360 --> 03:22.120
- Morning, darling.
- Morning.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.239
Want coffee?

03:23.880 --> 03:24.799
Yes, please.

03:25.880 --> 03:26.880
What's going on?

03:26.880 --> 03:30.480
Well, I... I thought
I'd make you some breakfast.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.600
- Why?
- We haven't done this in a while.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.080
- Well...
- It's nice.

03:37.080 --> 03:38.320
Mmm.

03:38.320 --> 03:39.560
Hey, Joy.

03:39.560 --> 03:41.840
How did you sleep? How are you?

03:41.840 --> 03:43.480
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:45.079 --> 03:47.079
It's the election stuff today.

03:47.679 --> 03:48.959
I'm obviously not gonna win,

03:48.959 --> 03:51.320
so it feels like that was
a massive waste of time.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.959
Well, you did your best,

03:53.600 --> 03:55.440
which is never a waste of time.

04:01.359 --> 04:02.880
Have you heard from Maeve?

04:03.959 --> 04:05.239
She landed this morning.

04:05.239 --> 04:08.839
I know it might be hard, darling,
but I think she made the right decision.

04:08.839 --> 04:11.560
She was so discouraged
when I spoke to her.

04:11.560 --> 04:12.959
What do you mean?

04:12.959 --> 04:16.880
Well, I think she convinced herself that
she wasn't good enough for the course.

04:16.880 --> 04:20.800
And, well, that's just ridiculous.
She's such an intelligent young woman.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.360
So I told her that she'd had a knock

04:23.360 --> 04:25.920
and that she shouldn't
let it affect her ambition,

04:25.920 --> 04:29.160
and she should go back and finish.

04:32.520 --> 04:33.360
What?

04:34.080 --> 04:35.760
You told Maeve to go back to America.

04:35.760 --> 04:36.800
Well, no--

04:36.800 --> 04:40.160
She wanted to stay here with me, Mum.
Everything was fine.

04:40.160 --> 04:42.320
I didn't tell her anything
she didn't already know.

04:42.320 --> 04:43.919
Of course you did!

04:43.919 --> 04:45.479
- You're always doing this!
- Hi.

04:45.479 --> 04:47.000
You get inside people's brains.

04:47.000 --> 04:51.000
You wheedle in
like some wheedling brain wheedler!

04:51.000 --> 04:54.400
Darling, you told me that you wanted me
to be more involved in your life.

04:54.400 --> 04:56.080
Don't you dare put this on me!

04:56.080 --> 04:59.160
I wanted you to ask me how my day was,
not therapize my girlfriend

04:59.160 --> 05:01.280
into getting on a plane
and breaking up with me.

05:01.280 --> 05:04.240
Oh, Otis. I didn't know you broke up.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.440
You crossed a line.

05:06.479 --> 05:08.960
I was worried you were having
another mental breakdown,

05:08.960 --> 05:12.760
but no, you're just consistently fucking
with everything in my life.

05:12.760 --> 05:15.280
- Don't talk to your mother like that--
- Don't get involved.

05:15.280 --> 05:17.760
No, I will get involved.
Your mum does everything for you.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.680
At least talk to her with some respect.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.640
Oh my God. I hate you both!

05:21.640 --> 05:23.280
Otis, don't...

05:26.320 --> 05:27.320
Fuck.

05:31.560 --> 05:32.599
You're back.

05:34.599 --> 05:35.599
Not really.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.880
I've got a friend
with a spare room down south,

05:39.880 --> 05:42.720
so, uh, I've just come to say goodbye

05:42.720 --> 05:46.200
and to, uh, pick up my LED face mask.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.880
Do you mind if I have a shower
and get changed before I go?

05:50.880 --> 05:53.039
No, go on.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.120
Thanks.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.880
Thanks for sticking up for me.

06:00.880 --> 06:01.880
It's all right.

06:10.599 --> 06:11.440
Cal?

06:13.400 --> 06:14.520
Cal, can I come in?

06:35.039 --> 06:37.960
You sure you wanna do this?
Maybe it's just a misunderstanding.

06:37.960 --> 06:39.240
You saw the letter.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.320
It's all sexy and gross.

06:41.320 --> 06:42.919
Yeah, your mum is kind of filthy.

06:42.919 --> 06:44.160
- Odusanya!
- Sorry.

06:47.039 --> 06:48.160
I think this is it.

06:52.880 --> 06:53.919
Good luck.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.760
Hi, how can I help you?

07:21.159 --> 07:22.039
Hi.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.200
Uh, I'm Jackson.

07:25.120 --> 07:25.960
Marchetti.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.200
Are you Jerome Saibu?

07:29.960 --> 07:31.400
This is a bit strange. I... I...

07:32.359 --> 07:35.640
I found a letter that you wrote to my mum.

07:36.239 --> 07:37.479
Her name is Roz...

07:37.479 --> 07:39.599
- Dad, who is it?
- ...Anderson.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.880
I think you guys used to
work together a while back.

07:45.080 --> 07:46.120
I think

07:47.359 --> 07:49.320
you could be--

07:49.320 --> 07:51.760
- Leave my property. Please.
- You could be my dad.

08:48.120 --> 08:51.440

- Aisha, what? No!

Oh, that's very nice

09:04.120 --> 09:09.079

that O's apology was a bit fake.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.760
Guys, that's really mean.

09:25.959 --> 09:28.920
Hi. Sorry, do you know Cal Bowman?

09:28.920 --> 09:30.680
- Yes.
- I'm their mum.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.000
They didn't come home last night,
and they're not answering their phone.

09:34.000 --> 09:37.800
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't seen them.

09:38.560 --> 09:42.360
I've called the police,
but they're just not taking it seriously.

09:42.880 --> 09:45.240
They just...
they don't seem themself now, and I'm...

09:54.520 --> 09:56.280
Ooh wow.

09:59.600 --> 10:00.680
This one's good.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.520
It's upside down.

10:02.520 --> 10:04.440
Oh, it's better that way.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.480
Our first art auction. I'm excited.

10:12.680 --> 10:15.079
- What?
- Can I kiss you?

10:17.920 --> 10:19.600
We've been eating cheese and onion.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.400
I don't mind.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.320
Oh God! Cal's gone missing.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.520
- Just pop it on there.
- No worries.

11:04.520 --> 11:05.839
What's going on?

11:05.839 --> 11:09.240
Oh, Cal Bowman's been missing
since last night. That's their mum.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.079
Christ, how awful.

11:11.079 --> 11:14.199
Yeah, yeah. We'll make sure
there's people searching the skate park.

11:18.000 --> 11:20.160
Thank you for coming, everyone.

11:20.160 --> 11:22.760
Cal is in a very vulnerable place
right now,

11:22.760 --> 11:25.839
so we need to start
searching for them straight away.

11:25.839 --> 11:29.240
Their last text message said they were
going to Pinelands Shopping Center.

11:29.240 --> 11:32.320
This is a real moment
to focus on the power of intention

11:32.320 --> 11:34.199
and manifest finding Cal.

11:34.199 --> 11:36.839
Come on. Let's do this.
Come on, Cavendish!

11:36.839 --> 11:38.800
Whoo!

11:40.640 --> 11:41.640
Thank you.

11:43.800 --> 11:44.959
Should we get some?

11:46.000 --> 11:46.880
Oh.

11:50.360 --> 11:53.839
- I am so happy you are doing this.
- Hmm.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.400
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:56.400 --> 11:58.120
- Good morning, Pastor.
- Hello, girls.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.280
- Hello.
- Eric, can I have a quick word?

12:01.280 --> 12:02.480
Yeah. Yeah.

12:04.800 --> 12:05.920
I'm very sorry.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.600
Someone looked up your college online,

12:08.600 --> 12:11.400
and we've had some complaints
about your fundraiser.

12:12.360 --> 12:13.280
Why?

12:14.880 --> 12:17.800
The college values are not something
the church can support.

12:17.800 --> 12:21.160
I'm afraid the church council
have decided we cannot accept your money.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.520
- But the fundraiser is tonight.
- I know.

12:27.160 --> 12:28.719
It's out of my hands.

12:30.079 --> 12:33.079
Please don't let this
ruin your special day.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.199
Maybe you should go home
and tell your parents.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.560
I wanna be here, okay?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.599
What if Cal's not all right?

12:57.959 --> 12:59.480
Oh, Otis, mate.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.320
Can I speak to you about a sex thing?

13:03.120 --> 13:05.800
- You don't wanna speak with Connor?
- Well, he's all booked up.

13:06.400 --> 13:09.640
Basically, what it is, yeah,
is me and Abbi, yeah,

13:09.640 --> 13:11.480
we tried to have sex last night,

13:11.480 --> 13:15.560
and I thought everything was sound,
but then she set my blanket on fire.

13:17.160 --> 13:18.480
Are you okay?

13:18.480 --> 13:21.800
She might have done it on purpose,
like, to try and get out of it.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.959
We've been going back to basics,
just like you said, but it's not working.

13:25.959 --> 13:30.480
We barely even kiss anymore,
and we still haven't had sex.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.880
Well, it sounds to me like
she's still feeling some kind of pressure.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.599
I know it's hard, but I think
you just have to be patient. Yeah?

13:39.760 --> 13:40.880
Sorry about the blanket.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.599
My nan knitted that. I'm gutted.

13:44.719 --> 13:45.760
Thanks.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.000
It's best if we split into groups,
so you guys go together.

13:49.000 --> 13:52.320
And then you two and then you guys
come with me. Where's Roman?

13:52.320 --> 13:55.240
- Look who it is.
- Did you see her apology?

13:55.240 --> 13:57.440
- Hey, can I go with you guys?
- Oh, no.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.719
Too little too late.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.360
What's the plan?

14:04.680 --> 14:08.400
I would rather wear synthetic wool.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.800
What? I did apologize.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.560
You kind of apologized
to everyone except her.

14:33.920 --> 14:36.079
- Have you seen this person?
- No, sorry.

14:36.079 --> 14:40.000
- Thanks.
- Guys, no one's seen Cal anywhere.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.920
- Aimes?
- What?

14:41.920 --> 14:45.760
It's 50% off.
I shop when I'm stressed, Jackson.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.280
Uh, Viv?

14:48.640 --> 14:49.599
Can we talk?

14:51.079 --> 14:52.640
Hey, are you okay?

14:53.199 --> 14:54.040
Um...

14:55.040 --> 14:55.959
Yeah.

15:00.319 --> 15:02.839
- Hi.
- Are you here to find Cal?

15:04.000 --> 15:07.479
I didn't know what else to do.
You weren't responding to my messages.

15:07.479 --> 15:10.040
I know I upset you, and I made a mistake.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.920
I... I just can't stand seeing you
with anyone else.

15:12.920 --> 15:15.360
I know that's wrong,
and I'm gonna work on it.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.079
No. I... I can't talk to you right now.
I'm gonna go back to my friends.

15:32.680 --> 15:33.760
I'm gonna go.

15:42.839 --> 15:44.199
That's the money you need.

15:46.199 --> 15:47.520
Why are you giving me this?

15:47.520 --> 15:48.640
You're right.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.839
I am a fucked-up person.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.599
I really wanted it to work out with Jakob.

15:58.839 --> 16:00.240
I really loved him.

16:01.680 --> 16:03.800
And I wanted to raise Joy with him.

16:05.120 --> 16:06.120
But...

16:08.560 --> 16:12.439
a little bit of me knew
that she wasn't his,

16:13.560 --> 16:18.439
and I just really
didn't want it to be true,

16:18.439 --> 16:22.359
so I blocked it out,
and now it's all fucked-up.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.319
I'm sorry.

16:24.319 --> 16:28.000
Yeah, well, I quit the show, and...

16:29.120 --> 16:32.160
and I'm going to get myself together.

16:32.160 --> 16:33.599
Why did you do that?

16:33.599 --> 16:36.560
Because it's not fair on Joy.

16:36.560 --> 16:38.520
You've really been growing in confidence.

16:38.520 --> 16:40.520
No, it's the right decision.

16:41.599 --> 16:44.880
Look, I know I'm not good
at asking for help. Come here.

16:46.959 --> 16:49.040
It's been so nice to have you here.

16:49.719 --> 16:53.240
And if you stayed here for a while,
you could start your nursery.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.479
I slept with Dan.

16:56.760 --> 16:57.880
Of course you did.

17:00.280 --> 17:03.040
But you don't need to worry.
I realized he has those toes

17:03.040 --> 17:04.760
that are all the same length,

17:04.760 --> 17:07.680
and he gave me the ick,
so I'm not into him anymore, anyway.

17:07.680 --> 17:09.319
I know what you're doing, Jo.

17:09.319 --> 17:12.919
You don't get to just blow it up
so that you can leave like always.

17:12.919 --> 17:16.640
Let's just... just stay here,
and we'll work on it.

17:16.640 --> 17:19.880
I would die of boredom out here. I...

17:21.680 --> 17:22.960
I really need to go.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.280
Keep the money.

17:38.040 --> 17:41.600
I know that you're leaving your job
because you think that you're a shit mum,

17:42.120 --> 17:46.440
but you have raised Otis so brilliantly,
and you're gonna do the same with Joy.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.200
I wish we'd had a mum like you.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.760
Uh, hi. Sorry. Um...

18:50.760 --> 18:52.880
You've not seen
this person recently, have you?

18:52.880 --> 18:55.320
Oh yeah,
they were here last night.

18:55.320 --> 18:59.200
They ordered three cheeseburgers
and then didn't eat them.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.640
It was weird.

19:01.720 --> 19:03.600
Do you guys have security cameras?

19:05.360 --> 19:06.760
Okay, thank you.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.399
Security. Where's security?

19:12.040 --> 19:15.960
- Would you like to try Boats by Boats?
- No, I've got... Ugh, don't...

19:17.760 --> 19:18.800
It's quite nice.

19:20.600 --> 19:23.440
Hey. Bit of an emergency, um...

19:24.000 --> 19:26.120
We need to look at
last night's security tapes

19:26.120 --> 19:27.640
from the food court.

19:27.640 --> 19:30.800
- Our friend is missing, and we're worried.
- Sorry, can't help you.

19:30.800 --> 19:33.840
- They were here last night. We--
- You'll have to call the police.

19:35.320 --> 19:39.360
Harriet. Harriet Anders.
From Moordale Secondary.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.960
Shut up.

19:44.600 --> 19:46.760
You're Ruby Matthews.

19:46.760 --> 19:48.240
As if you remember me.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.960
Of course I remember you. Why wouldn't I?

19:49.960 --> 19:53.560
Because you were such a bitch.
I mean, you were magnificent.

19:55.080 --> 19:56.159
But terrifying.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.320
- Can I have a selfie?
- Of course you can.

19:59.320 --> 20:02.679
If you let us take a peek
at those security tapes.

20:02.679 --> 20:03.800
Yeah, of course.

20:06.679 --> 20:09.600
- What's happening?
- She's kind of a big deal.

20:10.760 --> 20:12.280
Cheese.

20:25.880 --> 20:26.720
Adam.

20:31.280 --> 20:33.360
- What are you doing here?
- I've been worried.

20:36.960 --> 20:38.080
Why are you worried?

20:39.840 --> 20:41.480
Because you're not talking to me.

20:45.440 --> 20:47.440
And a student has gone missing at college.

20:47.440 --> 20:50.080
It made me think about what I'd do
if anything happened to you

20:50.080 --> 20:51.880
while you still thought that...

20:53.560 --> 20:54.919
that I don't like you.

20:54.919 --> 20:56.120
You don't like me.

20:56.120 --> 21:00.280
No. Adam, I do like you very much.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.560
I love you.

21:07.720 --> 21:08.679
You're my son.

21:15.640 --> 21:17.120
I just don't like myself.

21:20.080 --> 21:24.159
And I've made you feel small
because of that, and I deeply regret it.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.080
And I know we can never
get that time back,

21:29.080 --> 21:30.919
but I am trying to change.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.919
Do you wanna hug a horse?

21:40.520 --> 21:43.679
- Pardon?
- Hugging a horse makes things feel better.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.439
Oh, uh...

21:49.360 --> 21:52.159
Uh, no, I'm okay. Thank you.

21:55.439 --> 21:56.320
But I'd

21:57.679 --> 21:59.159
quite like to hug you.

22:04.280 --> 22:05.120
Uh...

22:49.679 --> 22:52.240
- Dad.
- Uh, yes.

22:53.159 --> 22:55.679
Just about to teach my first lesson.

22:57.240 --> 22:58.880
Maybe I could stay and watch.

22:59.399 --> 23:00.960
You could join in if you like.

23:03.800 --> 23:06.040
I...

23:07.439 --> 23:09.520
No. Uh...

23:09.520 --> 23:10.439
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

23:10.439 --> 23:12.040
<i>♪ Oh, Jesus ♪</i>

23:12.040 --> 23:14.720
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

23:14.720 --> 23:16.360
<i>♪ Oh, Jesus ♪</i>

23:16.360 --> 23:20.960
<i>♪ Amen ♪</i>

23:20.960 --> 23:22.840
Hallelujah!

23:22.840 --> 23:24.600
Amen.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.480
Please be seated.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.720
It's now time for our baptism.

23:35.240 --> 23:37.240
Adedayo, my son.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.280
Are you ready to take this next step?

23:42.439 --> 23:44.480
Hallelujah! Whoo!

23:47.880 --> 23:49.560
Do you renounce all sin

23:49.560 --> 23:52.880
and accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

23:54.240 --> 23:55.080
I do.

23:59.159 --> 24:02.040
Would you like to share anything
with your community?

24:02.640 --> 24:05.720
I've done many things in my life
that I am ashamed of.

24:08.120 --> 24:09.720
Things that have made me unclean.

24:09.720 --> 24:12.320
But today, I turn my back on sin

24:12.320 --> 24:16.439
and thank God for his mercy
that I can be reborn and made pure.

24:16.439 --> 24:17.720
Praise God.

24:17.720 --> 24:19.840
Hallelujah!

24:21.520 --> 24:25.000
It is my honor to baptize you

24:25.000 --> 24:29.800
in the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

24:52.480 --> 24:54.560
Eric, it's your turn.

24:55.080 --> 24:57.080
Are you ready to take this next step?

24:57.080 --> 24:59.360
Do you renounce all sin

24:59.360 --> 25:02.600
and accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and Savior?

25:19.439 --> 25:20.520
Um...

25:21.399 --> 25:24.120
I have something that I need to say.

25:24.120 --> 25:27.120
Hallelujah. Speak your truth, Eric.

25:32.280 --> 25:36.199
I don't know how you're all
gonna feel about my truth.

25:40.960 --> 25:43.600
I thought God
wanted me to be baptized today.

25:44.520 --> 25:46.360
And I wanted to make God happy.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.120
I wanted to make you all happy,

25:50.320 --> 25:51.919
especially my family.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.080
But I can't stay silent any longer.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.159
I have to tell my truth.

25:57.159 --> 26:01.280
Otherwise, I will be half a person,
and I can't live like that.

26:03.360 --> 26:07.199
My name is Eric Effiong.

26:09.080 --> 26:10.399
And I'm a Christian.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.919
And a proud gay man.

26:16.520 --> 26:19.159
I know a lot of you feel
that what I've just said is sinful

26:19.159 --> 26:22.600
and that I need to pray for forgiveness,
but you're wrong.

26:23.600 --> 26:25.399
My heart is torn,

26:26.360 --> 26:29.960
because I'm in a position
where I have to either choose

26:29.960 --> 26:33.360
to hide my truth and live in pain

26:34.439 --> 26:36.520
or be honest and lose my community.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.560
I keep getting told
that I need to wait and be patient,

26:40.560 --> 26:43.199
but I'm tired of waiting.

26:47.399 --> 26:52.439
And I love myself too much
to not tell my truth.

26:53.199 --> 26:57.600
So, if you love me as I am,

26:57.600 --> 26:59.240
I will be baptized,

27:01.360 --> 27:02.560
but if you don't,

27:03.640 --> 27:04.880
then I must leave.

27:26.320 --> 27:29.240
I love you as you are, my son.

27:50.720 --> 27:51.800
I have my answer.

28:15.399 --> 28:19.600
I know! A completely normal day,
and then she just walks in.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.760
Literally, the best day of my life.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.040
OMG, Lana.

28:26.040 --> 28:28.280
No, she's actually not scary at all,

28:29.280 --> 28:32.240
and her skin is so soft.

28:41.880 --> 28:43.800
What if something bad has happened?

28:43.800 --> 28:45.720
Just say positive, Aish.

28:45.720 --> 28:48.240
I don't feel positive. I feel worried.

28:48.240 --> 28:50.879
Try and breathe, and remember
the power of manifestation.

28:50.879 --> 28:51.800
Abbi.

28:54.480 --> 28:56.360
I don't think I know that one yet, sorry.

28:56.360 --> 28:58.480
- I think she said fuck off.
- Why?

28:58.480 --> 29:01.560
Because I wanted
to express a normal emotion,

29:01.560 --> 29:02.959
and you never let us.

29:02.959 --> 29:08.080
You want us to be positive all the time,
and that's why we never tell you a thing.

29:08.600 --> 29:10.760
- Like what?
- I want to be a pescatarian.

29:10.760 --> 29:11.879
What about the oceans?

29:11.879 --> 29:14.439
See? I can't tell you anything.

29:14.439 --> 29:15.560
Okay, fine. What else?

29:15.560 --> 29:17.919
I like gossip. It's fun.

29:17.919 --> 29:19.600
And Roman hates yoga.

29:19.600 --> 29:20.800
What?

29:20.800 --> 29:25.840
I do hate yoga, and I'm really sad
that we don't have sex anymore.

29:25.840 --> 29:28.959
- You guys don't have sex anymore?
- Why are you ganging up on me?

29:28.959 --> 29:31.840
Uh, Roman, I think your intimacy issues
should be separate,

29:31.840 --> 29:34.120
and you can talk about that privately.

29:35.080 --> 29:36.080
Sorry, um,

29:37.760 --> 29:40.959
I... I actually think
it might all be connected.

29:42.600 --> 29:46.560
Abbi, why do you feel the need
to keep things positive all the time?

29:49.040 --> 29:53.240
Uh, thinking negative things
just makes me feel heavy. Um...

29:53.919 --> 29:56.639
Basically, everyone important in my life
has rejected me.

29:56.639 --> 29:59.360
That must be really difficult for you.

29:59.360 --> 30:02.800
I imagine there's a lot of emotions
that you're keeping at bay.

30:03.919 --> 30:08.280
If I think about how I feel,
then I just wanna scream.

30:08.280 --> 30:10.520
So I think it's better
if I keep things light.

30:10.520 --> 30:13.840
That makes sense. It feels like
you can't cope with anything else.

30:13.840 --> 30:18.199
Well, sometimes, that constant positivity
can become a little bit toxic.

30:18.199 --> 30:21.840
And if you're shutting down
those very natural negative reactions,

30:21.840 --> 30:24.199
it can hurt you
a little bit further down the line.

30:26.439 --> 30:28.560
I just get scared of saying
how I really feel

30:28.560 --> 30:30.800
in case you guys abandon me as well.

30:30.800 --> 30:33.280
We would never reject you, Abbi.

30:33.280 --> 30:35.000
You're part of us.

30:36.000 --> 30:40.320
Navigating conflict
and having these difficult conversations,

30:40.320 --> 30:43.040
that's the mark of
a true relationship with someone.

30:44.080 --> 30:47.720
Do you think you'd feel comfortable
sharing more of those negative thoughts?

30:53.120 --> 30:56.439
Aisha, the way you pick your fingernails
in class is disgusting.

30:56.439 --> 31:00.120
And sometimes, I don't wanna hear about
Mercury being in fucking retrograde.

31:01.000 --> 31:02.639
And, Roman, we don't have sex anymore

31:02.639 --> 31:06.240
because you make this loud moaning noise
when we kiss, and it's so irritating.

31:06.240 --> 31:07.240
It's all I think about.

31:07.240 --> 31:11.159
Your natural toothpaste isn't working
because your breath smells like garlic.

31:11.159 --> 31:12.280
You need fluoride.

31:12.280 --> 31:14.520
That actually felt really good.

31:16.199 --> 31:17.360
Hang on.

31:19.959 --> 31:21.199
What noise do I make?

31:21.720 --> 31:24.520
Hey, Grace.
Did Lana tell you who I'm here with?

31:25.879 --> 31:28.879
Yeah, I think we might be best friends.
We're getting on really well.

31:29.480 --> 31:32.080
I know. Yeah, you can just feel it
when it's right, can't you?

31:32.080 --> 31:33.800
And it's definitely right.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.600
Yeah, I did. And I was
the only person who could help,

31:36.600 --> 31:38.840
so, like,
we're sitting together right now.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.360
Yeah, I thought that,
but no, she's really nice.

31:43.959 --> 31:44.959
We're getting on so well.

31:44.959 --> 31:48.560
Like, you know when you just
have chemistry with someone.

31:48.560 --> 31:50.719
Thank you.
Think I've found something.

31:51.800 --> 31:52.879
Call you back.

31:55.760 --> 31:56.800
No.

31:58.719 --> 32:01.240
Yep, it smells like burgers. That's it.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.760
Fine.

32:11.040 --> 32:12.199
Get in.

32:12.199 --> 32:14.439
One jump should do. Big one.

32:14.959 --> 32:16.879
- Okay.
- One, two, three.

32:17.480 --> 32:18.719
Yeah. Hop.

32:18.719 --> 32:21.800
- Ugh. It smells.
- It's a bin.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.520
- One, two, three.
- Shut up!

32:27.560 --> 32:29.000
Drop. Just drop.

32:31.760 --> 32:33.360
- Okay.
- Hey, can we, um...

32:35.199 --> 32:36.639
Jesus Christ.

32:36.639 --> 32:39.719
Look, I don't know if
you saw the video or not, but I, um...

32:39.719 --> 32:40.639
Okay, no way.

32:40.639 --> 32:42.800
I did really mean it, and...

32:44.000 --> 32:46.000
But I also should have
just said it to your face.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.560
You deserve a proper apology.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.879
I just didn't really know
if you'd actually wanna hear it

32:50.879 --> 32:52.480
because of how far I dug myself in,

32:52.480 --> 32:55.399
but you know,
what I did to you was really horrible.

32:57.919 --> 32:59.240
For what it's worth,

33:00.520 --> 33:04.280
I didn't really like myself
for doing that. I still don't.

33:04.959 --> 33:05.840
Um...

33:07.360 --> 33:08.879
And I am really sorry.

33:10.280 --> 33:11.919
No. No. No.

33:11.919 --> 33:12.959
Thank you.

33:14.199 --> 33:16.600
I needed to hear that, so...

33:19.480 --> 33:21.000
I got it. I got it.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.360
Yes.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.199
Let's open it. Open it.

33:30.480 --> 33:32.040
Why have they dumped their stuff?

33:34.159 --> 33:35.959
I think we need to call the police.

33:38.560 --> 33:41.360
<i>This is
a customer announcement for Gina.</i>

33:41.360 --> 33:43.320
<i>Gina, your mum is waiting for you.</i>

33:44.280 --> 33:47.360
<i>Gina, please come
to reception. Thank you.</i>

33:48.280 --> 33:49.719
Are you all right, Viv?

33:52.959 --> 33:55.560
He seems quite persistent.

33:55.560 --> 33:56.480
Um...

33:59.320 --> 34:02.840
- You know? Maybe I should just text him.
- Do not text him, Viv.

34:03.439 --> 34:05.760
I know,
but he can be really sweet.

34:05.760 --> 34:07.520
You just haven't seen that side of him.

34:07.520 --> 34:10.319
And, yes, he gets jealous,
but he has low self-esteem.

34:10.319 --> 34:11.719
It's not his fault.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.560
- And it's not your fault.
- No.

34:14.480 --> 34:15.799
How do you feel with him?

34:16.760 --> 34:19.440
Sometimes I feel happy,

34:20.159 --> 34:23.360
and then sometimes he makes me feel
like I've done something wrong.

34:23.360 --> 34:24.679
It's really confusing.

34:24.679 --> 34:26.719
I don't know
when he's gonna get upset next.

34:26.719 --> 34:27.839
Viv.

34:28.360 --> 34:32.839
Viv, I've been reading a lot of stuff
about abuse for my art,

34:33.639 --> 34:36.520
and it does sound like
he could maybe be emotionally coercive.

34:36.520 --> 34:39.560
He's so controlling, Viv.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.960
I just feel confused.

34:45.600 --> 34:48.600
Love should make you feel safe.
It should make you feel braver

34:48.600 --> 34:51.360
because you can be totally yourself
around that person.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.400
It shouldn't be confusing,
and it shouldn't be scary.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.240
Shit, I think I know where Cal is.

35:06.200 --> 35:07.799
- I'll text you, okay?
- Okay.

35:08.920 --> 35:10.240
- All right.
- Thank you.

35:39.720 --> 35:40.600
Oh my gosh.

35:44.240 --> 35:45.080
Oi!

35:48.160 --> 35:50.360
Um, excuse me!

35:51.920 --> 35:57.480
Excuse me! You've got my ph--
Excuse me! Give me my phone!

35:58.280 --> 35:59.200
Oi.

36:07.680 --> 36:08.760
I know you.

36:10.040 --> 36:11.080
No!

36:18.920 --> 36:22.120
Look, I can't... I couldn't get baptized.

36:23.680 --> 36:28.400
Okay, I can't be something that I'm not!

36:50.440 --> 36:51.720
What do you want from me?

36:54.560 --> 36:55.799
Why are you laughing?

36:56.960 --> 37:00.080
Because you've done
exactly what I wanted you to do.

37:03.720 --> 37:08.160
Today was the start
of a long and hard road.

37:09.200 --> 37:12.400
I will be with you every step of the way.

37:17.000 --> 37:20.480
You will change hearts and minds

37:20.480 --> 37:23.799
and let everyone know
that I love them for who they are.

37:25.760 --> 37:27.400
This will be your calling.

37:28.560 --> 37:30.400
It will be your life's work.

37:31.680 --> 37:32.839
I don't think so.

37:39.319 --> 37:41.240
I made you this bright

37:41.839 --> 37:45.640
so that others would see in the darkness.

38:02.160 --> 38:03.440
What do I do now?

38:17.400 --> 38:19.520
Oh, no more poo, please. I beg.

38:37.359 --> 38:38.319
Cal.

38:45.280 --> 38:46.200
Cal?

38:56.960 --> 38:57.839
Cal.

39:04.720 --> 39:05.920
Uh,

39:05.920 --> 39:06.920
I think...

39:08.120 --> 39:10.200
I think people are looking for you.

39:13.680 --> 39:15.120
I've been here for a while.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.319
I don't really know what happened.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.120
Then I got scared, and then...

39:30.720 --> 39:32.040
I couldn't go home.

39:35.160 --> 39:38.240
If you wanna talk about it, I'm here.

39:39.480 --> 39:43.480
But also,
if you just wanna sit in silence...

39:45.960 --> 39:47.400
then we can do that too.

39:49.760 --> 39:50.839
It feels like I'm...

39:53.319 --> 39:54.200
drowning.

39:57.960 --> 40:02.480
I can't wait any longer,
and I wish I could make it stop because...

40:04.839 --> 40:06.160
that's never gonna change.

40:07.640 --> 40:08.799
It's gonna be okay.

40:11.240 --> 40:13.520
I don't think the world
wants people like me in it.

40:16.200 --> 40:17.120
Cal?

40:17.720 --> 40:20.560
Cal. Oh, you're okay. Thank God.

40:20.560 --> 40:22.560
- There's, like, a search party.
- Jackson. Jackson.

40:22.560 --> 40:24.200
- Everyone was so worried.
- Jackson.

40:26.400 --> 40:28.200
Are people angry that I worried them?

40:30.200 --> 40:31.560
No, no one's angry.

40:33.480 --> 40:34.799
They're gonna be happy

40:36.440 --> 40:37.520
that you're safe.

40:43.000 --> 40:48.600
Cal, I had no idea that you were having
such a difficult time.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.680
I'm so sorry that I let you down.

40:58.359 --> 41:00.160
We should've all done more

41:01.480 --> 41:04.720
to show you just how loved you are.

41:04.720 --> 41:06.720
Things have to change, Cal,

41:06.720 --> 41:09.120
because people like us
aren't going anywhere.

41:10.880 --> 41:15.440
I know that the world can be harsh,
but you're not alone.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.040
We need you here with us.

41:19.880 --> 41:21.240
Shall we take you home?

41:22.960 --> 41:24.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:49.000 --> 41:51.120
<i>Do you want to hear my song?</i>

41:52.480 --> 41:54.480
<i>I will play a song for you now.</i>

42:01.319 --> 42:03.600
Oh my God. Cal's been found. They're safe.

42:04.640 --> 42:05.839
Oh my God.

42:06.839 --> 42:08.799
They found Cal.

42:08.799 --> 42:10.600
- Oh my God. Thank you.
- Oh my gosh.

42:10.600 --> 42:12.000
Eric found Cal!

42:16.280 --> 42:18.280
- Thank you, Abbi.
- You guys!

42:22.319 --> 42:25.359
I want to explain
about this morning.

42:26.280 --> 42:30.080
I've still got some stuff with intimacy

42:31.200 --> 42:32.359
since the assault,

42:32.359 --> 42:36.799
and I guess I was scared to tell you
'cause I thought it might put you off.

42:37.319 --> 42:41.080
Aimee, you could never put me off.
I'm really glad that you told me.

42:42.040 --> 42:43.560
There you go.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.480
Thank you.

42:48.240 --> 42:49.839
There's something I have to do.

42:58.160 --> 42:59.680
- Thank you.
- Bye!

43:04.880 --> 43:07.080
No one's gonna feel it, bro.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.400
- Sorry, I should take this.
- Yeah, do your thing.

43:09.920 --> 43:10.920
Hello.

43:11.560 --> 43:13.000
<i>Maeve Wiley?</i>

43:13.000 --> 43:17.839
<i>This is Caitlin Reed from Goodhart Books.
I read your piece,</i> Southchester.

43:17.839 --> 43:19.480
You...

43:19.480 --> 43:21.960
How... Sorry. How did you read my piece?

43:21.960 --> 43:24.080
<i>Ellen Rasmussen gave it to me.</i>

43:24.080 --> 43:27.040
<i>I've been speaking to her
as part of the Wallace internship.</i>

43:27.040 --> 43:30.160
<i>Anyway, it's a very evocative piece.</i>

43:30.160 --> 43:32.319
<i>I'd really like to read some more
if you have it.</i>

43:33.960 --> 43:37.640
Yeah, sure. I can send
some more over to you. Definitely.

43:37.640 --> 43:40.480
<i>That would be fantastic.
We'll be in touch.</i>

43:40.480 --> 43:42.319
Okay. Thanks.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.359
Very good. Well done.

43:50.359 --> 43:52.240
- Thank you.
- Great poise, Liza.

43:52.240 --> 43:54.640
- Keep it up, Sophie. Good job.
- Yay!

44:00.799 --> 44:02.200
Come on, Michael, we're trotting.

44:02.200 --> 44:04.359
Uh, no, no. I'm okay walking. Thank you.

44:04.359 --> 44:07.280
Come on, Michael.
We're trotting now, mate. Giddyap.

44:07.280 --> 44:08.799
Whoa! Whoa!

44:08.799 --> 44:10.640
Ah!

44:10.640 --> 44:12.920
- Am I doing it?
- You are. You're doing great!

44:12.920 --> 44:15.400
Ah! I'm bouncing now. Ooh!

44:15.400 --> 44:18.920
Ow! Ah. Ah. How am I doing? Ah!

44:18.920 --> 44:19.839
How do I stop?

44:21.120 --> 44:22.359
Are your legs all right?

44:22.359 --> 44:24.120
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Yeah?

44:24.120 --> 44:25.120
Okay.

44:27.720 --> 44:30.640
- Um, I'll meet you in the car.
- Oh, okay.

44:31.240 --> 44:33.359
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, thanks. Bye.

44:33.359 --> 44:34.440
Yup.

44:35.680 --> 44:36.680
Oh Christ.

44:37.240 --> 44:38.200
Well done.

44:38.839 --> 44:39.799
Thanks.

44:42.600 --> 44:44.960
I wasn't completely honest with you
the other day.

44:46.600 --> 44:47.839
My ex is called Eric.

44:49.760 --> 44:53.600
I'm attracted to men and women.
It's not a phase. That's just who I am.

44:55.040 --> 44:57.760
And I haven't always liked that
about myself, but I want to.

44:58.359 --> 45:02.200
And, anyway, I just wanted you to know.

45:09.960 --> 45:11.400
Do you wanna go on a date?

45:14.839 --> 45:15.720
Yeah.

45:17.879 --> 45:18.920
I'd like that.

45:26.799 --> 45:28.839
We've got 90 seconds, Tilly.

45:28.839 --> 45:30.359
It's gonna be great.

45:30.359 --> 45:31.920
Don't forget to smile.

45:35.160 --> 45:36.200
Stop.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.799
Oh, Jean. We haven't actually started, so...

45:38.799 --> 45:41.520
Right. Um, I made a mistake.

45:41.520 --> 45:44.879
I don't want to quit.
I want to keep doing the show.

45:44.879 --> 45:47.120
But if I am gonna do it,
I have to do it my way.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.680
No cohosts, no making it spicy
for spicy's sake.

45:51.680 --> 45:56.000
Just proper in-depth therapy sessions
with listeners and me.

45:56.000 --> 46:00.319
That's what I'm good at. I think it could
be great if you give me another chance.

46:00.319 --> 46:03.240
Um... what's going on?

46:03.240 --> 46:06.480
Yes, good. Yep. Jean. Jean. Jean.

46:06.480 --> 46:10.280
This is Tilly. Tilly, this is Jean.

46:10.280 --> 46:12.160
Tilly's filling in your show.

46:12.160 --> 46:14.960
Tilly's show is about
antiquing and true crime.

46:14.960 --> 46:17.520
It's fun. Tilly, not today. I'm sorry.

46:17.520 --> 46:21.400
We're gonna rearrange your time slot.
So off you pop. Another time.

46:21.400 --> 46:22.480
You're great.

46:23.839 --> 46:25.960
Bright future. Good luck. Jean.

46:26.640 --> 46:27.600
Oh, sure.

46:27.600 --> 46:31.760
On that, I want you to let me
bring in my baby anytime I need to,

46:31.760 --> 46:36.080
and I need a private area
to be able to pump milk.

46:36.080 --> 46:38.040
Sure you do. We'll talk about that later.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.080
Okay.

46:39.960 --> 46:40.960
Right.

46:46.960 --> 46:50.080
This is Dr. Jean Milburn,

46:50.080 --> 46:53.120
and you are listening to <i>Sexology.</i>

46:53.120 --> 46:55.640
Please call in. I am here.

46:57.200 --> 46:59.960
Every time. Every time.

46:59.960 --> 47:01.359
- Oh, yeah.
<i>- </i>  Psych.

47:01.359 --> 47:03.879
That's how you're gonna
do me today? All right.

47:03.879 --> 47:05.560
- Hey.
- I won't forget.

47:06.760 --> 47:08.000
I know about Jerome.

47:10.240 --> 47:12.359
I found this letter.

47:12.879 --> 47:15.799
So he's my biological father, isn't he?
I went to see him.

47:17.040 --> 47:18.200
Told him who I was.

47:18.960 --> 47:20.799
And he asked me to leave.

47:20.799 --> 47:24.680
I just want to know everything,
and I want to know it now.

47:41.000 --> 47:42.160
What are these?

47:50.920 --> 47:52.560
Jackson, take a seat.

47:56.280 --> 47:58.080
Before I met your mum,

47:58.080 --> 48:00.640
I had an affair with a married man.

48:01.240 --> 48:04.760
It was a mistake, but I was confused.

48:06.480 --> 48:08.680
And then I fell pregnant with you.

48:10.560 --> 48:13.720
It was unexpected and stressful,

48:13.720 --> 48:17.160
but I very quickly realized
I was so happy.

48:18.400 --> 48:21.680
The thing is, Jerome already had a family.

48:22.319 --> 48:24.680
I sent him updates and photos.

48:24.680 --> 48:27.440
I thought if he saw
how incredible you are,

48:27.440 --> 48:29.200
he might change his mind.

48:30.000 --> 48:33.080
But he just sent them back unopened.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.839
And then I met your mum.

48:39.560 --> 48:41.040
And everything changed.

48:45.280 --> 48:48.040
We <i>wanted</i> to raise you together.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.600
To be a family.

48:53.280 --> 48:59.000
We didn't want you to, in any way,
feel like you were unloved.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.600
What?

49:08.680 --> 49:09.680
I have to go.

49:10.839 --> 49:13.080
- I have to go.
- What?

49:13.080 --> 49:16.960
- I can't believe you lied to me.
- Jackson, we were trying to protect you.

49:27.799 --> 49:30.400
- Hey, Savior!
- Hey.

49:30.400 --> 49:32.960
Look who it is. It's <i>the</i> savior.

49:32.960 --> 49:36.240
What a hero. You found Cal.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.839
Uh...

49:39.240 --> 49:41.000
Guys, I've got some bad news.

49:42.799 --> 49:46.480
The church isn't going to accept
any of the money

49:46.480 --> 49:49.280
that we raise tonight at the fundraiser.

49:49.280 --> 49:51.000
Oh, I can't believe it.

49:51.000 --> 49:52.440
- I can.
- Oh, fuck!

49:55.680 --> 49:58.240
Sorry. Sorry. I'm... I'm good.

49:58.240 --> 49:59.760
Oh gosh.

49:59.760 --> 50:01.520
I'll see you guys in there.

50:10.480 --> 50:12.200
What are we
gonna fundraise for now?

50:12.200 --> 50:14.680
Well, there's this charity
for homeless guinea pigs.

50:14.680 --> 50:16.760
Oh, I love guinea pigs.

50:17.680 --> 50:19.160
- Hey.
- Hey.

50:20.799 --> 50:25.240
I was gonna call you earlier,
but I was being all stubborn.

50:27.040 --> 50:30.319
- I wanted to call you as well.
- Been thinking about what you said.

50:30.319 --> 50:35.440
And I think I do feel uncomfortable
about some of our differences,

50:35.440 --> 50:37.399
and I've never known how to talk about it

50:37.399 --> 50:40.560
because I'm scared
that I'm gonna get it wrong

50:41.200 --> 50:42.560
or I'm gonna upset you.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.440
I shouldn't be afraid of that.

50:45.960 --> 50:49.240
Shouldn't be afraid of those conversations
because you're my best friend.

50:52.120 --> 50:54.280
And I feel like I've lost a lot this year,

50:56.000 --> 50:57.799
and I couldn't survive if I lost you.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.640
You're not gonna get rid of me.

51:14.080 --> 51:16.240
Look, we're getting ready
for the fundraiser here.

51:16.240 --> 51:17.399
Mm-hmm.

51:17.399 --> 51:19.080
Do you care to join?

51:19.080 --> 51:21.799
- Would I like to join?
- Would you like to join?

51:21.799 --> 51:23.879
- Like to join?
- Am I getting a little invite?

51:23.879 --> 51:26.280
You're getting
a little invite into The Coven.

51:27.040 --> 51:29.839
I don't really know about
the whole hat and jacket.

51:29.839 --> 51:32.080
Ah, absolutely not.
Take that off right now.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.480
- Okay. Something else.
- It's just not very you.

51:34.480 --> 51:36.760
- No, it's not.
- You can do better.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.000
You can do well better.

51:38.000 --> 51:41.160
- I hate this song.
- Yeah, same. Can you change it, babe?

51:45.080 --> 51:47.520
<i>There are treatment options
for a tight foreskin.</i>

51:47.520 --> 51:49.839
Ah! Oh my God. It's your mum!

51:49.839 --> 51:52.120
Oh my God. I love her. Let's listen.

51:53.160 --> 51:55.760
Maybe we raise money
for people with tight foreskins?

51:55.760 --> 51:58.200
<i>...talcum powder. Thank you, Adrian.</i>

51:58.200 --> 52:00.480
Keep those calls coming.

52:00.480 --> 52:03.680
And remember,
there are no topics that are off-limits.

52:03.680 --> 52:08.440
Our next caller is Joanna.

52:09.879 --> 52:11.240
Hello, Joanna.

52:11.960 --> 52:13.720
What's on your mind tonight?

52:14.480 --> 52:15.520
<i>I, um...</i>

52:16.399 --> 52:21.879
<i>Something, um, happened to me
when I was, um, 12.</i>

52:21.879 --> 52:23.520
There was a man.

52:23.520 --> 52:26.680
He was... he was a boyfriend of my mum's,

52:26.680 --> 52:30.000
and he... touched me.

52:32.200 --> 52:33.319
I mean, he...

52:35.920 --> 52:37.879
abused me, and, uh,

52:38.560 --> 52:40.200
<i>I don't think I'm okay.</i>

52:41.080 --> 52:45.080
<i>I am never happy or... or secure,</i>

52:45.080 --> 52:50.000
<i>and I think I need to get
some help with that, but I'm scared.</i>

52:51.080 --> 52:53.319
Can you tell me what you're scared of?

52:53.839 --> 52:57.920
<i>The thing is, I've, um... I've never liked
to stay in the same place for too long.</i>

52:57.920 --> 52:59.120
<i>I, um...</i>

52:59.799 --> 53:02.200
I'm scared that if I stop moving

53:02.200 --> 53:06.600
and I start properly talking
about what happened,

53:06.600 --> 53:08.640
then it might all catch up on me,

53:08.640 --> 53:12.040
and I won't be able
to pretend that I'm okay anymore.

53:14.160 --> 53:16.520
<i>Thank you for sharing that, Joanna.</i>

53:19.720 --> 53:24.120
What you have experienced
is truly soul-crushing...

53:27.280 --> 53:31.480
and deciding that you no longer want
to bury these things is...

53:32.000 --> 53:35.399
is very brave and powerful.

53:37.160 --> 53:39.600
<i>But you're right. It is scary.</i>

53:40.240 --> 53:44.200
<i>Now, I don't usually share things from</i>

53:44.200 --> 53:46.920
my own life, but

53:48.080 --> 53:49.640
<i>I just had a baby,</i>

53:50.240 --> 53:53.080
<i>and I've been diagnosed</i>

53:53.080 --> 53:56.040
<i>with postnatal depression.</i>

53:56.839 --> 54:01.319
Now, I didn't even realize
that anything was wrong.

54:01.839 --> 54:04.960
I didn't want to accept
that anything was wrong.

54:08.799 --> 54:09.680
But

54:10.879 --> 54:13.280
just saying it out loud...

54:15.920 --> 54:18.399
is really the first step to getting help.

54:19.920 --> 54:24.240
<i>It sounds to me that
you're ready to do this work on yourself,</i>

54:24.760 --> 54:27.120
<i>but I would urge you</i>

54:27.680 --> 54:32.640
<i>to lean on your friends and family
during this time, Joanna.</i>

54:32.640 --> 54:35.920
<i>There's no reason
for you to deal with this alone.</i>

54:37.120 --> 54:38.960
- Sexy.
<i>- </i>  Thanks, babes.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.480
She's ready, girls.

54:42.480 --> 54:45.080

Hey, Molloy wants to see you.

56:10.319 --> 56:11.160
I...

56:12.120 --> 56:13.160
Oh, okay.

56:17.120 --> 56:21.440
Oh, um, Caitlin Reed called me.
Thanks for sending her my writing.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.799
It's a brilliant piece.

56:22.799 --> 56:25.960
It's annoying because she wasn't
that interested in what I'd written.

56:26.720 --> 56:29.359
But, you know, it's fine.
I don't think I want to write anymore.

56:29.359 --> 56:33.680
I think I want to set up a tech company,
or maybe I'll go into banking.

56:37.200 --> 56:39.839
Okay. Well, thank you.

56:40.680 --> 56:42.520
- I'll see you later.
- I'll see you later.

56:43.120 --> 56:44.040
All right!

56:44.720 --> 56:45.720
Bro, we got this!

56:46.480 --> 56:47.879
Maeve, thanks for dropping in.

56:49.560 --> 56:50.839
It's good to have you back.

56:51.720 --> 56:52.760
Maeve.

56:53.560 --> 56:54.399
Come on.

56:59.000 --> 57:02.120
I was sorry to hear about your mother.

57:03.319 --> 57:04.200
Yeah, thanks.

57:05.240 --> 57:08.640
I also heard that there's been
some interest in <i>Southchester.</i>

57:09.600 --> 57:10.839
Congratulations.

57:11.399 --> 57:13.560
Yeah, I'm excited about it.

57:16.080 --> 57:20.160
I just wanted to say that I know I was
harsh with you the last time we spoke.

57:20.879 --> 57:22.960
You told me
I wasn't cut out to be a writer.

57:24.720 --> 57:27.520
I was just trying to push you
to be better.

57:28.440 --> 57:30.000
I don't think you were.

57:30.520 --> 57:34.040
And even if that is true,
your words really crushed me.

57:35.279 --> 57:38.120
And I almost didn't come back
because of you.

57:38.879 --> 57:41.560
And unlike most students on this campus,

57:41.560 --> 57:44.520
I haven't grown up
being told I'm brilliant or deserving.

57:45.399 --> 57:49.000
If I take a risk, and it doesn't work out,
I don't have a safety net to fall back on,

57:49.000 --> 57:53.480
and you're going to come across
other students like me, so

57:54.879 --> 57:57.120
I just want you to know
that, as a teacher,

57:57.120 --> 57:59.200
your words hold a lot of power.

58:04.080 --> 58:05.319
I went home and

58:06.879 --> 58:10.120
reminded myself of what I'm made of
and where I want to go.

58:12.120 --> 58:14.440
You don't get to be
the gatekeeper of my dreams.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.120
Okay.

58:19.279 --> 58:20.680
I can take that on board.

58:27.240 --> 58:32.680
It's... it's just not easy sometimes
watching all of you at the beginning.

58:36.200 --> 58:37.120
Yeah.

58:40.440 --> 58:42.200
- I'll see you in class.
- Mm-hmm.

58:58.440 --> 59:01.200
I'm so glad you're okay.

59:07.440 --> 59:11.839
I came to ask if you'd be comfortable
with us raising money tonight

59:11.839 --> 59:12.919
for your top surgery.

59:14.960 --> 59:15.879
That's amazing.

59:17.960 --> 59:19.080
Thank you so much.

59:20.200 --> 59:21.600
Will you come with me?

59:23.960 --> 59:25.440
No. Uh...

59:26.000 --> 59:28.839
I'd love to, but I don't think
I'm ready to see everyone.

59:38.399 --> 59:40.839
- Do you like auctions?
- I've never been to one before.

59:40.839 --> 59:42.040
- Have you not?
- No.

59:42.040 --> 59:45.480
Oh, last one I went to,
my mum won a year's supply of ham.

59:45.480 --> 59:46.399
Oh?

59:46.399 --> 59:48.560
Ugh, it was way too much ham.

59:48.560 --> 59:50.440
- Viv.
- Oh, he's here again.

59:50.440 --> 59:52.240
Can we please talk?

59:52.240 --> 59:56.799
Okay. Okay, um, Beau,
we've spoken about this already,

59:56.799 --> 01:00:00.120
but you don't seem to be listening,
so I'm gonna be really clear.

01:00:00.839 --> 01:00:03.040
I don't wanna talk to you.
I don't wanna see you.

01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:05.279
I don't wanna hear from you.

01:00:05.279 --> 01:00:08.799
I don't know what made you like this,
and it's probably something really sad,

01:00:08.799 --> 01:00:13.440
and I hope you seek out some therapy,
but if you keep on trying to contact me,

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.960
I will report you.

01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.680
Do you hear me?

01:00:18.359 --> 01:00:19.279
Yeah.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.680
Oh my God.

01:00:31.319 --> 01:00:33.040
- You're amazing.
- You too.

01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:35.520
Wow!

01:00:39.399 --> 01:00:40.640
How did it go?

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.720
I've got a lot
to fill you in on.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.160
Turns out my mum was filthy!

01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:49.440

01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:51.279

Our next piece is called <i>Melon</i>

01:00:56.759 --> 01:01:00.440
by the wonderfully talented Aimee Gibbs.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.919
Let's keep those bids coming.
We're raising money for Cal.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.000
Let's start the bidding at 50 pounds.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.120
Whoo!

01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:11.919
- Very nice. Fifty-five, anyone?
- Fifty-five.

01:01:11.919 --> 01:01:13.359
- Sixty!

01:01:13.359 --> 01:01:15.839

175 pounds.

01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:19.799
Going,

01:01:21.240 --> 01:01:22.600
going...

01:01:23.839 --> 01:01:27.960
Sold to Miss Masters for 175 pounds.

01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:31.040
I've seen your photographic pieces,
and they're very good.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.279
Who knows how much
<i>Melon</i> will be worth in a few years.

01:01:33.279 --> 01:01:37.359
Moving on to our next item,
which is Miss Winton's hat collection.

01:01:37.359 --> 01:01:39.399

- Fifty pounds at the back.

I know a lot's happened today,

01:02:19.879 --> 01:02:24.520
but it's time to announce the winner
of the student counselor elections.

01:02:27.319 --> 01:02:28.359
Vote Connor!

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.919
It's the real fun. It's the real fun.

01:02:30.919 --> 01:02:32.279
It's time to go. It's time to go.

01:02:32.279 --> 01:02:34.520

01:02:36.839 --> 01:02:40.120
Can I have all the candidates
to the stage, please?

01:02:41.399 --> 01:02:42.399
Thank you. Hello.

01:02:42.399 --> 01:02:44.080
Hello. Welcome.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:45.160
Yeah.

01:02:45.160 --> 01:02:46.080
Thank you.

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:47.799
Take your time. Okay.

01:02:50.160 --> 01:02:51.080
Whoo!

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:53.799
And the winner is...

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:58.319
Connor Pearson!

01:03:04.399 --> 01:03:07.279
Go, Connor! Get in there! Come on!

01:03:07.879 --> 01:03:09.040
Thank you.

01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:11.799
Oh, this means a lot.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.839
But I cannot accept the position.

01:03:14.839 --> 01:03:17.560
I've been doing therapy sessions
for the last few days,

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.520
and you guys have a lot of problems.

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:23.359
It's been kind of exhausting
and a bit gross.

01:03:23.359 --> 01:03:24.480
Rude!

01:03:24.480 --> 01:03:28.759
Otis, I only ran because I was hoping
I could get on the radio with your mum

01:03:28.759 --> 01:03:30.560
because she's, like, super hot.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:31.480
Oh my God.

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.279
But it's too much work.

01:03:33.279 --> 01:03:36.160
So, yeah, I'm out.

01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.399
Don't. Don't. Don't.

01:03:43.399 --> 01:03:45.520
Okay, well, thank you, Connor.

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:48.960
I suppose that means
we have to go with the runner-up then,

01:03:49.560 --> 01:03:50.600
which is

01:03:51.279 --> 01:03:52.919
Otis Milburn!

01:03:52.919 --> 01:03:54.319
Whoo!

01:03:54.319 --> 01:03:56.120
Lady hater!

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:57.759
He's a misogynist.

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.960
Wow. Okay. Um...

01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.799
Uh, thanks. This is unexpected.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.319
Um...

01:04:08.319 --> 01:04:12.240
I didn't think anyone was gonna vote
for me after the whole meninist thing.

01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:13.680
I voted for you.

01:04:14.759 --> 01:04:17.160
Great. Thanks. Thanks for the vote.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.240
Um...

01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.319
Well, I'm... I'm afraid
I can't take this position either because

01:04:27.759 --> 01:04:32.279
you guys already have
a fantastic student therapist,

01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:34.560
and that made me feel threatened.

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:38.839
I convinced myself
that my behavior was acceptable

01:04:38.839 --> 01:04:40.799
because I thought
I was the better therapist.

01:04:42.680 --> 01:04:44.759
But I'm... I'm really not,

01:04:45.279 --> 01:04:47.720
and I should never have
taken away someone's space like that,

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.520
and this position has always been O's, so...

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:00.680
- Um...
- She's a bully.

01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:01.919
Get her off the stage!

01:05:01.919 --> 01:05:04.640
Boo!

01:05:05.799 --> 01:05:07.120
No. No, no, no.

01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:09.720
Stay there.
I... I would like to say something.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:11.359
Sh!

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.480
Hello. I'm Ruby Matthews.

01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:16.480
Who?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:18.439
The bed wetter. Uh...

01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:22.319
I released that video
because I wanted to destroy O

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:25.040
like she destroyed me,

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:28.600
and I thought it was gonna feel very good,
and it didn't,

01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.120
which is very annoying
because it made me realize

01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:35.879
that this stupid college

01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:41.200
is starting to make me have
the... the feelings or something.

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:48.160
And I honestly thought that this whole
"being kind" thing was a load of crap.

01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:51.160
Nobody can be perfect.
And you're certainly not.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.919
But I've realized you're trying
to make the world a better place.

01:05:58.480 --> 01:06:01.480
And that makes me want to be better.

01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:06.080
I think the Cavendish thing to do
would be to give her a second chance.

01:06:06.080 --> 01:06:07.640
You go, bed wetter!

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.560
Right, then.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:20.919
Okay, so I guess this means
that, um, O here is our therapist again.

01:06:21.799 --> 01:06:23.600
This was a huge waste of time.

01:06:24.439 --> 01:06:25.520
So, let's dance!

about how we can be
more open and inclusive.

01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.279
What?

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:14.399
Uh...

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.600
Well, I think... I think
you might need more than discussions.

01:07:20.359 --> 01:07:21.919
But that is a great start.

It's okay. I don't need your pity.

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:21.440
No, I... I genuinely think
we might make a good team.

01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:25.880
And maybe you're right.
It might not be so bad to have a friend.

01:10:28.320 --> 01:10:29.240
Okay.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.840

and I know that's the right thing to do,

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.200
but I kind of hoped
she might have reached out by now.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.160
Oh.

01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.720
- I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

that I wanna be a pastor.

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:30.360

- Yes.

01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:48.320
- Yes.
- I thought you'd never ask.

01:11:48.320 --> 01:11:50.920

- I'm gonna beat your ass.

01:11:50.920 --> 01:11:52.280

Oh, uh, <i>Third Wives of Miami</i> is on.

Michael.

01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:17.080
I'm just dropping Adam home.

01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.080
We've been hanging out.
I watched him teach a class today.

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.440
And he was excellent.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:27.840
Uh, anyhow, I'll let you two
get on with your evening.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.320
Um, I was thinking that...

01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:36.639
maybe we could watch some TV for a bit.

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160
Yeah.

01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:45.160
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:17.120
Jackson?

01:13:21.639 --> 01:13:23.840
- I should've told you sooner.
- Yeah.

01:13:28.200 --> 01:13:29.920
I didn't want you to hate me.

01:13:30.679 --> 01:13:32.000
I don't hate you, Mum.

01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.440
I'm angry at you though.

01:13:38.679 --> 01:13:39.599
Both.

01:13:40.200 --> 01:13:42.200
It's okay to be angry with us.

01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.320
But we're not going anywhere.

01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:46.560
We're gonna work through this together.

01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.599
Why didn't he want to know me?

01:13:48.599 --> 01:13:50.480
Because he's a fool, Jackson.

01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:54.040
He has no idea what he's missing.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.440
How can anyone not want to know
someone as brilliant as you?

01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:05.280
You are. You are. You are.

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:08.800
Oh.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.760
Love you.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.400
I love you.

01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:35.639
I'm so sorry, Mum.

01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.599
You do not have to say sorry.

01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:42.400
I just wish I knew how to make it better.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.920
Sorry.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.520
I love having sex with you.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.200
I love being inside of you.

01:15:29.719 --> 01:15:31.679
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:39.400
You can't catch me
because I'm too fast for you.

01:15:39.400 --> 01:15:40.599
Oh!

01:15:40.599 --> 01:15:42.040
He's too quick for you.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:44.560
- Slap. And jump. Slap.
- Do you think you're--

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.599
Pull it. Aim.

01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:51.400
Whoa! Goodbye. Good night. It's the end.

01:15:53.520 --> 01:15:56.240
- Go again.
- Sorry. It's the end. No.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.360
That's such a nice smile.

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.719
- Hello, darling.
- Hey.

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:20.920
How was your night?

01:16:21.599 --> 01:16:23.880
It was quite fun, actually.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:34.719
I'm sorry about yesterday.

01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:38.840
Maeve leaving was the right thing for her.

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:43.760
- I shouldn't have taken it out on you.
- Thank you for apologizing.

01:16:47.599 --> 01:16:49.480
How are you feeling about it all?

01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:51.960
Okay.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.639
Well, it's all right not to be okay.

01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.320
I'm worried that
if I think about it too much,

01:17:03.320 --> 01:17:07.480
I'm gonna end up all sad
like you were when Dad left.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:10.280
So I'm just not.

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:17.920
I think you shouldn't try
to block out all those emotions

01:17:18.719 --> 01:17:21.360
because that's how
heartbreak becomes unresolved

01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.040
and turns into something bitter.

01:17:25.719 --> 01:17:28.920
It's really important
that you feel all those feelings,

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:31.240
as much as they hurt.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.440
- Thanks.
- Oh.

01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:45.599
- I love you, darling.
- Love you too.

01:17:47.440 --> 01:17:49.639
And I'm proud of you

01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.840
for getting help.

01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:53.880
Thank you.

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:58.840
He's proud of me.

01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:03.719
- I'll get it.
- Thanks.

01:18:09.719 --> 01:18:10.599
Ah.

01:18:10.599 --> 01:18:11.679
Hey, little dude.

01:18:11.679 --> 01:18:14.280
- You all right?
- No, broke my leg several places.

01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.840
- You coming in?
- I thought I might. Would that work?

01:18:16.840 --> 01:18:18.120
Do you need a hand?

01:18:18.120 --> 01:18:20.760
No, it's cool.
I have the crutch-arinos.

01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.480
Mum, it's, uh, motorbike man.

01:18:25.679 --> 01:18:28.160
Yeah, I mean, it's normally just Dan,
but, uh...

01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:30.320
Fuck it. Call me motorbike man.
That's cool.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.000
- Hi, Dan.
- Hey, Jean.

01:18:32.599 --> 01:18:35.000
Oh shit! Baby! That's cool.

01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:36.480
Congratul-aciones.

01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.960
- Thank you for coming.
- It's all good.

01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.200
You might wanna have a seat.

01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:46.599
Sure, okay. Maybe I'll just...

01:18:46.599 --> 01:18:47.840
Are you all right?

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.280
Go ahead and use the table.

01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.360
Thank you. Hi, baby.

01:18:53.639 --> 01:18:55.520
Thanks. So, what's up?

01:19:41.960 --> 01:19:43.120
<i>Dear Otis.</i>

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.360
<i>You know I hate soppy romantic stuff.</i>

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:48.080
<i>So don't get your hopes up.
This isn't a love letter.</i>

01:19:49.679 --> 01:19:52.120
<i>When we first met, I didn't trust anyone.</i>

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:54.040
<i>I thought if I kept everybody out,</i>

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:56.360
<i>I'd stop myself
from being hurt or let down,</i>

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.120
<i>which is what I was used to.</i>

01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.760
<i>Then we set the clinic up together,
and I realized that most of the people</i>

01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:05.240
<i>who came to us for help
really just needed connection.</i>

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.599
<i>And maybe I wasn't so different.</i>

01:20:08.960 --> 01:20:12.120
<i>You have the rare ability
to make people feel truly seen.</i>

01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:13.760
<i>And you did the same for me.</i>

01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.719
<i>It was this and your relentless optimism
about human beings</i>

01:20:17.719 --> 01:20:21.040
<i>that gave me the courage to start
opening myself up to other people.</i>

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:24.080
<i>For the first time in my life,
I didn't feel alone,</i>

01:20:25.040 --> 01:20:27.719
<i>which allowed me
to imagine something bigger for myself.</i>

01:20:29.160 --> 01:20:31.280
<i>I want you to know that
however much it fucking hurts</i>

01:20:31.280 --> 01:20:35.040
<i>that we can't be together,
I won't ever close myself off again.</i>

01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:40.560
<i>Meeting you cracked my heart open,
and now it's forever changed.</i>

01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.560
<i>And because of that,</i>

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:45.040
<i>I will carry a part of you with me
wherever I go.</i>

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.280
<i>I think what I'm trying to say is</i>

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.599
<i>thanks for everything,</i>

01:20:52.800 --> 01:20:53.880
