00:02.200 --> 00:03.617
Previously on Gilmore Girls.

00:03.701 --> 00:05.118
- She's not here yet.
- All right.

00:05.202 --> 00:07.287
You'll have to entertain me
until she arrives.

00:07.371 --> 00:10.206
- Okay, burger boy, dance.
- Will you marry me?

00:10.248 --> 00:12.625
- What?
- Looking for something to shut you up.

00:12.708 --> 00:14.626
I actually thought
you'd like to go with me.

00:14.710 --> 00:16.378
- You did not.
- I did, too.

00:16.420 --> 00:19.130
- You did not, because you are not stupid.
- Why, thank you.

00:19.214 --> 00:21.048
Slimy and weaselly, yes. But stupid, no.

00:21.132 --> 00:23.467
He was totally nice to you
and you were a big jerk.

00:23.551 --> 00:25.719
If you like Tristan so much,
you go out with him.

00:25.928 --> 00:28.263
- What did you do?
- You wanted something festive.

00:28.347 --> 00:31.099
- You made me a Santa burger.
- It's no big deal.

00:31.182 --> 00:34.810
No one ever made me something
quite this disgusting before.

00:34.894 --> 00:36.645
So you're the big, strong protector?

00:36.729 --> 00:38.355
Little princess needs a protector.

00:38.438 --> 00:39.897
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing.

00:39.981 --> 00:42.274
- Don't like your girlfriend.
- Doesn't look that way.

00:42.358 --> 00:44.192
- Were you on a date?
- What?

00:44.277 --> 00:46.528
- You have an escort.
- No, it's Luke.

00:46.612 --> 00:48.822
Which is her way of saying
we weren't on a date.

00:48.906 --> 00:50.240
I didn't mean it like that.

00:54.452 --> 00:56.662
- You don't want to fight me, Tristan!
- Why not?

00:56.745 --> 00:58.079
'Cause l'll kill you, idiot!

00:58.122 --> 01:00.248
What exactly is going on
between the two of you?

01:00.332 --> 01:01.499
We're friends, that's it.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.376
You're idiots, the both of you.

01:03.459 --> 01:04.793
He has a thing for you.

01:04.876 --> 01:07.671
No, he doesn't.
It's just a game to him or something.

01:07.755 --> 01:09.464
He has a thing for you.

01:09.548 --> 01:12.842
He does nothing but insult me
and make me miserable.

01:12.967 --> 01:14.760
He has a thing for you.

01:19.223 --> 01:20.682
Absolutely nothing.

01:20.766 --> 01:22.517
- Come on.
- I'm sorry. I'm looking.

01:22.601 --> 01:25.561
- But there is nothing in here.
- You're kidding, right?

01:25.645 --> 01:27.730
No, everything in here I wear.

01:27.813 --> 01:30.481
- What?
- I do. There's nothing to give up.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.610
The red-and-black halter top.

01:34.152 --> 01:35.403
- No.
- Why?

01:36.320 --> 01:37.362
It's a classic.

01:37.446 --> 01:39.405
It's got rhinestones
and zebra stripes on it.

01:39.490 --> 01:40.907
- So?
- Tassels.

01:40.991 --> 01:42.492
- Yes.
- It has tassels, Mom.

01:42.576 --> 01:44.827
Okay. I've had this since I was 17.

01:44.911 --> 01:46.829
I'm sorry. Did I mention the tassels?

01:46.913 --> 01:48.414
You're heartless and unsentimental.

01:48.497 --> 01:49.748
You are a hopeless pack rat.

01:49.832 --> 01:53.751
I don't understand why I have to uproot
my happy family of clothing, anyway.

01:53.835 --> 01:55.544
Because it's a charity rummage sale.

01:55.628 --> 01:57.087
- I know.
- That you helped organize.

01:57.171 --> 01:58.797
- Okay.
- And volunteered to run.

01:58.839 --> 02:01.591
It was very hot in that room that day.
I was dehydrated.

02:01.675 --> 02:03.426
They could have talked me into anything.

02:03.510 --> 02:04.677
- It was your idea.
- Okay.

02:04.761 --> 02:08.263
I'm a very sick woman,
and that should be apparent to anyone.

02:08.681 --> 02:10.681
Get out of the way.

02:11.183 --> 02:14.477
- What are you doing?
- Step away from the closet, please.

02:14.978 --> 02:16.646
This is so unfair.

02:17.021 --> 02:18.814
No, not that whole chunk.

02:18.856 --> 02:22.650
Okay, take that. That's ugly.
Just that one. No.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.902
Now, all of this goes.

02:25.028 --> 02:27.696
Come to this dresser, open the drawer,
and take out...

02:27.781 --> 02:30.783
everything you'd be embarrassed
to be wearing in a car accident.

02:30.866 --> 02:32.325
Meet me downstairs.

02:33.077 --> 02:34.161
Move!

02:36.000 --> 02:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:33.878 --> 03:35.629
- Sweater.
- Over here.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.050
- Jeans.
- In back of you.

03:41.718 --> 03:44.762
A big, furry, purple thing
that could either be a hat...

03:44.804 --> 03:47.347
a toilet paper cover,
or some kind of dirty hand puppet.

03:47.431 --> 03:49.140
Mystery box on the left.

03:50.142 --> 03:51.768
- Hey, Luke.
- Where do you want these?

03:51.810 --> 03:55.438
- What do you have?
- Clothes, rags, some old pots and pans.

03:55.479 --> 03:59.482
Kitchenware can go in the kitchen,
and the clothes right over there.

04:02.861 --> 04:04.862
- Here, Grinch.
- Thank you.

04:04.946 --> 04:06.822
- Who wants cheese?
- Are there crackers?

04:06.906 --> 04:08.907
Somewhere in the state
of Connecticut, yes.

04:08.991 --> 04:10.116
And in the Gilmore house?

04:10.200 --> 04:12.410
- Who wants cheese?
- Me, please.

04:13.078 --> 04:15.246
Kittens in the toilet poster?

04:15.329 --> 04:17.664
- Another one?
- This one's signed.

04:18.707 --> 04:21.750
There's a man in my kitchen!
Somebody call the constable.

04:21.834 --> 04:24.879
- Your mom's a fruitcake.
- Fruitcakes by the door, please.

04:24.963 --> 04:27.840
Goodbye, Rory.
I wish you luck with everything.

04:27.923 --> 04:29.340
I appreciate that.

04:29.758 --> 04:32.385
Okay, so rummage sale's Sunday.
Today's Tuesday.

04:32.469 --> 04:35.471
At this rate we're going to be sleeping
in the yard by Thursday.

04:35.555 --> 04:37.890
We've got to get this stuff
out of the living room.

04:37.974 --> 04:39.475
- Hello.
- Go away.

04:39.558 --> 04:40.892
I have a full set of dishes.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.978
- Come on in, Taylor.
- Dishes in the kitchen, please.

04:44.062 --> 04:46.355
Okay, but I have
to explain something first.

04:46.439 --> 04:49.691
- Fine, go ahead.
- The butter dish has a small chip in it.

04:49.775 --> 04:51.526
- Safety tip. Got it.
- It's fine.

04:51.610 --> 04:55.863
I filed down the chip. If you place it
strategically on the table, nobody'll know.

04:55.905 --> 05:00.450
Taylor, would you like to write
an instruction manual for the dishes?

05:00.534 --> 05:02.994
- Could I?
- Notepad's in the kitchen.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.708
That's nice.

05:11.043 --> 05:13.169
- Put that back.
- But it has rhinestones on it.

05:13.253 --> 05:16.589
The point of this is to get crap out,
not trade it in for new crap.

05:16.673 --> 05:19.091
- Are you seeing this?
- Yes, I am.

05:19.175 --> 05:21.176
I don't think you are,
because if you were...

05:21.260 --> 05:24.554
you would see that this obviously
has 'Lorelai' written all over it.

05:24.596 --> 05:27.890
- Fine. We'll get rid of it at next year's sale.
- Thank you.

05:29.183 --> 05:32.060
- You guys are gonna love me.
- We already love you.

05:32.144 --> 05:34.938
- No, I mean you're gonna really love me.
- We do.

05:35.022 --> 05:37.148
Trust me, you guys are gonna so love me.

05:37.232 --> 05:39.108
The love is starting to fade now.

05:39.192 --> 05:42.611
I have here in my hand,
as requested by Ms. Lorelai Gilmore...

05:42.695 --> 05:47.282
four fabulous tickets to The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater on Saturday.

05:47.741 --> 05:49.075
- What?
- No!

05:49.117 --> 05:50.951
- You love me?
- Baby, do I.

05:51.035 --> 05:53.286
- These look like good seats.
- Ninth row, aisle.

05:53.370 --> 05:56.289
I can't believe you got me my tickets.
How did you score these?

05:56.373 --> 05:58.374
- Remember the Birnbaum wedding?
- Fiji Fantasy?

05:58.458 --> 06:00.751
Yes. They were so thrilled
with the volcano cake...

06:00.835 --> 06:02.586
they wanted to do something nice for me.

06:02.670 --> 06:06.256
Since Mr. Birnbaum runs a ticket agency,
and I knew you were dying to go...

06:06.340 --> 06:09.175
- so I asked him if he could...
- Make four girls very happy.

06:09.259 --> 06:12.136
- Yeah, and he did.
- Huzzah for the Birnbaums!

06:12.303 --> 06:15.639
Sookie, if you got four tickets,
and you and mom go...

06:15.723 --> 06:17.224
then that means...

06:17.307 --> 06:19.266
One for you and one for Lane.

06:19.935 --> 06:21.019
Chickadee!

06:21.102 --> 06:24.980
This is gonna be a very special night.
You know what a special night deserves?

06:25.064 --> 06:26.148
What?

06:27.441 --> 06:28.733
- A new outfit.
- Mom.

06:28.775 --> 06:29.942
- Yes.
- No.

06:30.026 --> 06:31.443
What could the problem be?

06:32.528 --> 06:37.073
As I mentioned yesterday,
we will be holding a debate next week.

06:37.449 --> 06:41.535
Your subject:
Did Charles I receive a fair trial?

06:41.661 --> 06:44.079
The pros will represent the Parliament...

06:44.122 --> 06:45.623
who deemed they had sovereignty.

06:45.706 --> 06:47.624
The cons will represent the monarch...

06:47.666 --> 06:51.002
and try and prove
that the charge against him was not legal.

06:51.670 --> 06:53.755
What is fascinating, Mr. Dugray?

06:55.923 --> 06:57.799
Nothing, Ms. Caldecott.

06:57.841 --> 06:59.383
Nothing, Mr. Dugray?

07:00.510 --> 07:03.429
My notes are fascinating, Ms. Caldecott.

07:03.513 --> 07:05.973
Yes, they are fascinating, Mr. Dugray.

07:06.057 --> 07:07.474
As I was saying...

07:07.516 --> 07:10.852
the pro and con teams will each
have two minutes and thirty seconds...

07:10.936 --> 07:13.813
for introductions, six minutes to debate...

07:13.980 --> 07:15.689
three minutes for conclusions...

07:15.773 --> 07:18.316
and five minutes for questions
from the audience.

07:18.400 --> 07:22.194
The winner shall be decided
by a hand count from the rest of the class.

07:22.279 --> 07:24.864
Does that sound like fun, Mr. Dugray?

07:26.115 --> 07:28.950
- What?
- The debate. Does it sound like fun?

07:29.618 --> 07:32.870
- Yes, it does.
- It does, doesn't it, Mr. Dugray?

07:33.246 --> 07:35.122
It absolutely does, Ms. Caldecott.

07:35.165 --> 07:38.042
More fun than staring
at Ms. Gilmore's ear?

07:39.919 --> 07:42.546
- Yes, Ms. Caldecott.
- I think so, too.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.423
Okay. Any questions?
Good. I'll assign your teams.

07:46.966 --> 07:50.051
You, you, you, and you, con.

07:50.344 --> 07:53.471
You, you, you, and you, pro.

07:54.264 --> 07:57.308
- Who did she point to?
- Well, I think she...

07:57.517 --> 07:58.768
You, you, you...

07:58.851 --> 08:01.061
- Excuse me, Ms. Caldecott.
- Ms. Geller?

08:01.145 --> 08:03.647
I wasn't sure who you pointed to just now.

08:04.064 --> 08:07.608
Let's see. You, Ms. Lynn,
Ms. Grant, and Ms. Gilmore.

08:07.859 --> 08:11.445
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I am, but thank you for asking.

08:12.112 --> 08:14.030
Okay, you...

08:14.239 --> 08:17.158
you, you, and you, pro.

08:17.784 --> 08:19.368
You and you, con.

08:21.704 --> 08:24.122
- So I guess we should make a plan.
- To do what?

08:24.206 --> 08:26.291
To work out our debate, Madeline.

08:26.416 --> 08:28.501
- Yeah, right.
- We need a place to work.

08:28.585 --> 08:30.044
- My house is out.
- Why?

08:30.128 --> 08:32.254
- Because it is.
- We need a reason.

08:32.421 --> 08:34.506
My mother is having
the entire place redone.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.716
She wants all evidence of my father
out of there.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.717
So unless you want to sit on no furniture...

08:38.802 --> 08:41.846
and watch Harvey Fierstein
impersonators rip up the carpet...

08:41.886 --> 08:44.472
paint everything white
and call it 'Angel's Kiss'...

08:44.556 --> 08:47.058
then we're going to have to find
somebody else's house.

08:47.142 --> 08:50.644
- My brother has the measles.
- My mom's having an affair.

08:52.897 --> 08:55.232
I guess we could go to my house.

08:55.274 --> 08:58.568
We're having a town rummage sale,
so it's kind of a mess...

08:58.610 --> 08:59.735
but it's there.

08:59.819 --> 09:01.320
Isn't your house kind of far?

09:01.404 --> 09:04.990
- It's 30 minutes away by bus.
- Bus? I don't do bus.

09:05.574 --> 09:08.576
- Lf you have a better suggestion...
- l'll drive.

09:08.618 --> 09:11.078
- Okay. So then, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

09:11.120 --> 09:12.371
Fine.

09:13.122 --> 09:15.665
- Hey, Paris.
- Tristan, hi.

09:15.749 --> 09:17.917
I was really hoping
we'd be in the same group.

09:18.001 --> 09:19.543
- You were?
- Yeah.

09:19.586 --> 09:23.088
We'd make the long hours of studying
go by a lot faster.

09:23.172 --> 09:27.091
Plus, you and me on the same team.
We'd wipe the floor with the others.

09:27.134 --> 09:30.094
I guess we'll just have to pair up
on something else then, huh?

09:30.136 --> 09:32.596
- That would be good.
- Yeah, it would.

09:32.639 --> 09:36.016
I'll see you later.
Bye, Madeline. Bye, Louise.

09:36.767 --> 09:39.936
Tristan suddenly has very big eyes
for you, Grandma.

09:40.061 --> 09:42.312
- Lucky.
- Stop it. He's just being nice.

09:42.397 --> 09:44.523
- He should be so nice to me.
- And me.

09:44.607 --> 09:46.566
We need to get to class.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.781
- Tomorrow.
- Wow.

09:53.865 --> 09:55.783
- Yep.
- All three of them?

09:55.825 --> 09:58.160
'Double, double, toil and trouble.'

09:58.369 --> 10:00.287
It should make
for an interesting afternoon.

10:00.370 --> 10:03.455
'With the pricking of my thumbs,
something wicked this way comes.'

10:03.540 --> 10:05.791
- You're doing well in Shakespeare class?
- Not bad.

10:05.875 --> 10:07.376
- Good.
- Thanks.

10:07.460 --> 10:08.669
So what's the plan?

10:08.752 --> 10:11.963
We'll ask if I can go to a play
tomorrow night with you and Lorelai.

10:12.005 --> 10:14.090
- A play?
- I think that's the safest word.

10:14.132 --> 10:15.883
'Show' or 'concert' would be very bad.

10:15.967 --> 10:19.344
- What about saying it's a movie?
- Too far from the truth, almost a lie.

10:19.428 --> 10:20.804
But a play's not a lie?

10:20.846 --> 10:23.223
It's far enough from the truth
that it might work...

10:23.306 --> 10:24.765
but close enough to the truth...

10:24.849 --> 10:27.976
that I think I could negotiate
a purgatory stint, if forced to.

10:28.060 --> 10:30.478
- Play it is.
- Okay. We're going in.

10:31.813 --> 10:35.024
- Are you sure it's an original Queen Anne?
- Yes, original.

10:35.108 --> 10:36.901
- The joints look wrong.
- Joints are fine.

10:36.984 --> 10:39.611
- They look new.
- Nothing's new. Whole store is old.

10:39.653 --> 10:42.697
Do you have a certificate or a letter
saying that it's old?

10:42.781 --> 10:45.116
- Yes, l'll write a letter.
- Okay.

10:45.325 --> 10:48.119
I guess if it's really old, l'll take it.

10:48.411 --> 10:50.454
We appreciate your business.

10:50.704 --> 10:53.289
She just made a sale. Now's a good time.

10:53.665 --> 10:54.707
Hi, Mama.

10:54.791 --> 10:55.958
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.209
- You look flushed.
- I do?

10:57.293 --> 10:59.461
You ate candy, doughnut,
or Hostess fruit pie?

10:59.503 --> 11:00.670
No, nothing. I'm fine.

11:00.754 --> 11:02.088
- Hello, Mrs. Kim.
- Rory.

11:02.172 --> 11:04.298
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- I'm busy.

11:04.383 --> 11:07.594
I know. Could I could go somewhere
tomorrow with Rory and her mom?

11:07.677 --> 11:09.636
- Tomorrow's church.
- This would be after that.

11:09.720 --> 11:12.013
After church we think about
what we heard in church.

11:12.097 --> 11:15.141
I could think about what I heard in church
on the way to the show.

11:15.225 --> 11:16.476
- Show?
- Play.

11:16.518 --> 11:18.769
Not show, play. It's a play, Mama.

11:18.853 --> 11:21.563
Tell me about this play. What's it about?

11:21.647 --> 11:25.316
It's about a group of people
who own instruments...

11:25.359 --> 11:28.319
and stand in front of other people,
holding them.

11:28.945 --> 11:31.155
- What?
- I'm not sure what it's about.

11:31.197 --> 11:34.157
- We could find out.
- You find out, then we talk.

11:34.658 --> 11:37.326
Excuse me. I'd really like that letter,
if you don't mind.

11:37.369 --> 11:38.953
Yes, l'm coming.

11:41.414 --> 11:44.166
How's that purgatory negotiation looking?

11:44.208 --> 11:45.459
Not good.

11:45.542 --> 11:48.336
- What do we do now?
- I'll ask again later.

11:48.628 --> 11:51.672
- Call me if you need anything.
- Thanks. I will.

12:21.656 --> 12:23.407
If you want coffee, you'll have to wait.

12:23.491 --> 12:25.993
Someone put a sign for the rummage sale
on your window.

12:26.076 --> 12:27.952
You can have decaf now
if you're in a hurry.

12:28.036 --> 12:29.578
You should call the cops about this.

12:29.663 --> 12:32.457
We know how you feel
about public displays of town affection.

12:32.540 --> 12:34.541
Your mom asked me to put it there, okay?

12:34.625 --> 12:37.085
- And you said yes?
- She's not real good with no.

12:37.127 --> 12:38.419
No, she's not.

12:38.462 --> 12:42.256
Every second you laugh at me
is one second longer you wait for coffee.

12:42.340 --> 12:44.091
Sorry. No laughing.

12:50.555 --> 12:54.016
Margaret Atworthy dropped off
three boxes of City Council potholders...

12:54.100 --> 12:57.728
and begged me to take her grandson.
People are getting crazy, man.

12:59.730 --> 13:01.689
- What?
- What are you wearing?

13:01.773 --> 13:03.607
We've already argued
about the sweatshirt.

13:03.691 --> 13:05.859
Yes, but we have not argued
about the hat.

13:05.943 --> 13:07.944
- What hat?
- The one on your head, Annie Oakley.

13:08.028 --> 13:09.070
Great, isn't it?

13:09.113 --> 13:11.948
It's nice you're trying
to single-handedly rebuild a bridge...

13:12.032 --> 13:14.075
but stop buying other people's junk.

13:14.159 --> 13:16.744
Money goes to charity.
I look cute. Case closed.

13:16.786 --> 13:18.370
Finally, the coffee cavalry arrives.

13:18.454 --> 13:20.539
- What do you think you're wearing?
- A hat.

13:20.622 --> 13:22.081
- Take that off.
- What?

13:22.165 --> 13:24.792
- That is not yours. Take it off.
- But l'll have hat hair.

13:24.876 --> 13:26.961
- I'm talking about the sweatshirt.
- Calm down.

13:27.044 --> 13:28.378
That is not yours.

13:28.462 --> 13:30.880
No, I found it in the bags of stuff
for the sale.

13:30.964 --> 13:33.424
So you just find something
and take it? Is that it?

13:33.508 --> 13:35.634
- No, I paid for it.
- So that makes it all right?

13:35.718 --> 13:37.844
It makes it legal.
What is the matter with you?

13:37.929 --> 13:39.763
- Nothing's the matter.
- Luke.

13:39.805 --> 13:41.639
Pour your own coffee.

13:56.319 --> 13:59.780
Okay. Just a question.
Did anyone in town keep anything?

13:59.864 --> 14:02.449
- Doesn't look like it.
- I'll never be civic-minded again.

14:02.533 --> 14:04.284
You're doing a good thing.

14:04.701 --> 14:06.285
- Sookie?
- I'm okay.

14:06.369 --> 14:09.121
- Wave an arm.
- Here.

14:09.580 --> 14:10.914
I got you.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.751
Hold on. Something down here likes me.

14:15.794 --> 14:18.004
I'm good. Hold on. Up, please.

14:18.630 --> 14:20.923
Jeez, this stuff is like Tribbles.

14:21.007 --> 14:22.508
Thank God, just in time.

14:22.591 --> 14:24.717
Grab a bag
and move it to this side of the room.

14:24.801 --> 14:26.886
Be very careful.
This pile tried to eat Sookie.

14:26.970 --> 14:29.263
Maybe I should sic it on Paris
when she gets here.

14:29.347 --> 14:31.473
God, that's right.
You're studying here today.

14:31.515 --> 14:34.434
- Any minute, actually.
- This place is such a pit.

14:34.518 --> 14:35.769
Don't worry about it.

14:35.852 --> 14:38.229
They'll come in, make a face,
say something snotty...

14:38.313 --> 14:39.564
we'll study, they'll leave.

14:39.647 --> 14:41.857
I'm looking forward
to this whole day being over.

14:41.899 --> 14:44.317
- Then I can concentrate on the concert.
- Yeah.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.695
Lorelai, sweetheart,
would you come outside, please?

14:46.778 --> 14:49.280
I want to know
where you want me to put these.

14:49.364 --> 14:50.823
Coming, Patty.

14:50.907 --> 14:53.701
Two very large porcelain squirrels.

14:54.201 --> 14:56.244
- Set them free.
- Will do.

15:01.749 --> 15:04.793
Wow! These are great.

15:05.794 --> 15:08.045
They'll really come in handy
when we organize...

15:08.088 --> 15:10.548
that giant marching band
we've been talking about.

15:10.590 --> 15:13.926
I danced on these drums
at the Copacabana...

15:14.010 --> 15:15.803
in 1969.

15:15.886 --> 15:18.137
- Wow.
- It was a great act.

15:18.221 --> 15:21.932
- I wore bananas.
- Please tell me you have a picture of that.

15:22.725 --> 15:26.186
A lot of memories happened
on these drums.

15:26.645 --> 15:29.564
But I guess it's time to move on.

15:29.648 --> 15:31.024
Yeah, sure.

15:31.149 --> 15:33.400
Now you'll have room
for that enormous tuba...

15:33.484 --> 15:35.193
you've had your eyes on.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.030
Leave these here.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.159
Yeah, you, too. Bye.

15:46.746 --> 15:49.248
- That was Lane.
- What's the verdict?

15:49.498 --> 15:52.250
She decided to be stupid
and tell her mother the truth...

15:52.292 --> 15:55.544
that she wanted to go to a rock concert
with us tonight in New York.

15:55.586 --> 15:56.795
Stupid.

15:57.088 --> 15:59.465
- I'm so sorry.
- I'm making coffee.

16:00.048 --> 16:02.091
This looks really familiar.

16:02.175 --> 16:04.385
That's mine. I saw it first...

16:04.427 --> 16:06.470
and then I bought it, so it's mine now.

16:06.554 --> 16:08.180
Really? Who brought it in?

16:08.264 --> 16:11.308
I think Luke did,
and judging by his very hostile reaction...

16:11.391 --> 16:12.975
he wasn't done wearing it yet.

16:13.059 --> 16:15.894
- Oh, my. I wonder if...
- What?

16:16.312 --> 16:18.105
I bet this was Rachel's.

16:18.314 --> 16:20.524
Oh, my God, Rachel's?

16:20.774 --> 16:22.567
Rachel? Who's Rachel?

16:22.609 --> 16:25.069
Rachel was Luke's very serious girlfriend.

16:25.111 --> 16:28.363
- It does look like her.
- When did Luke have a girlfriend?

16:28.447 --> 16:31.658
This must have been,
what, five, six years ago?

16:31.825 --> 16:34.619
Did she break that man's heart.
It was terrible.

16:34.703 --> 16:36.120
How did I not know about this?

16:36.162 --> 16:39.790
Honey, you had an 11-year-old kid,
and you were just moving into this house.

16:39.874 --> 16:42.251
Plus Rachel traveled a lot.
She was a photographer.

16:42.292 --> 16:43.918
- Archaeologist.
- Really?

16:43.960 --> 16:45.085
Or flight attendant.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.255
I can't believe I never even heard about it.

16:47.338 --> 16:48.589
At least, I think so.

16:48.631 --> 16:51.633
Luke never talks about it.
No one else likes to talk about it...

16:51.717 --> 16:54.928
'cause he could kill you with that coffeepot
if he wanted to.

16:56.262 --> 17:00.223
I never pictured Luke having a girlfriend
or a broken heart.

17:00.308 --> 17:02.976
I would keep this hidden if I were you.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.979
I've got to be going.
Trampoline class at 2:00.

17:06.229 --> 17:07.605
- Bye, Patty.
- Bye-bye.

17:08.272 --> 17:09.773
Thanks for the drums.

17:10.566 --> 17:12.692
These all need to be mended.

17:12.943 --> 17:14.444
- My room.
- Okay.

17:22.159 --> 17:24.702
Rory, I think your friends are here.

17:26.788 --> 17:30.374
She must be one great baby-sitter,
to earn enough money for that car.

17:30.458 --> 17:32.501
Let's just get this over with.

17:32.585 --> 17:35.420
Take heart, my dear.
Suffer today, party tonight.

17:37.672 --> 17:39.381
- Hi.
- Hi.

17:40.508 --> 17:41.884
Come on in.

17:46.054 --> 17:49.932
- So did you guys find it okay?
- There's no sign on this street.

17:50.016 --> 17:53.018
That's why I told you to turn right
at the big rooster statue.

17:53.060 --> 17:55.979
- I thought you were kidding.
- No, we never kid about Monty.

17:56.021 --> 17:58.147
- Monty?
- Monty, the rooster.

17:59.024 --> 18:00.400
Monty the Magnificent.

18:00.483 --> 18:02.693
- Everybody, this is my mom.
- Lorelai.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.070
This is Louise, Madeline, and Paris.

18:06.030 --> 18:07.906
Very good girl-group names.

18:11.493 --> 18:13.452
Sorry about the house of horrors here.

18:13.536 --> 18:16.163
Some crazy lady volunteered
to lead this charity thing.

18:16.247 --> 18:19.332
We're trying to get her some help.
So make yourselves comfortable.

18:19.416 --> 18:22.251
- Just yell when you guys want pizza.
- Okay.

18:24.378 --> 18:27.046
So, do you guys want to work in here
or in the kitchen?

18:27.131 --> 18:28.382
Whatever.

18:29.633 --> 18:30.717
Okay.

18:35.388 --> 18:37.806
Okay. So here's how it should go:

18:37.890 --> 18:40.767
Madeline will do the introductions,
l'll handle the debate...

18:40.851 --> 18:44.020
Rory will do the conclusion,
and Louise will take questions.

18:44.062 --> 18:46.313
Why do you automatically
get to handle the debate?

18:46.397 --> 18:48.065
Because l'm the most experienced at it.

18:48.148 --> 18:50.942
Trust me, you want her to handle it.
She never gives up.

18:51.026 --> 18:52.277
Le pit bull.

18:53.653 --> 18:57.030
- So what is all this stuff?
- It's for a big town rummage sale.

18:57.073 --> 18:58.782
- Like a charity thing?
- Yeah.

18:58.866 --> 19:02.243
There's an old bridge falling apart,
and the town's trying to save it.

19:02.285 --> 19:05.079
- Cool hat.
- Put that down. It's used.

19:05.121 --> 19:07.581
- Vintage, dear.
- Filthy, darling.

19:07.665 --> 19:11.584
There's a store near my therapist's office
who has the best vintage clothes.

19:11.627 --> 19:14.295
I found an original Pucci top
for practically nothing.

19:14.379 --> 19:16.005
Pucci is very big right now.

19:16.089 --> 19:18.382
- Is this a Pucci?
- No, that's a Patty.

19:18.424 --> 19:20.092
- A Patty?
- Miss Patty.

19:20.175 --> 19:23.594
She's a dance teacher here.
These are some of her old costumes.

19:23.637 --> 19:26.222
Here, Paris. Tristan might like this.

19:26.472 --> 19:28.473
Can we just work, please?

19:28.933 --> 19:31.768
I would love to have a boyfriend
that looked like Tristan.

19:31.810 --> 19:33.769
Your boyfriend's no slouch either.

19:33.812 --> 19:36.814
- No, he's not.
- Yes, 6'2' and feisty.

19:37.106 --> 19:39.691
So how's it going?
Are you two still Joanie Loves Chachi?

19:39.775 --> 19:42.235
- God, I hope not.
- You are still together, aren't you?

19:42.319 --> 19:44.404
- We're still together.
- How long has it been?

19:44.446 --> 19:46.531
- I don't know.
- You do, too.

19:46.614 --> 19:49.241
- About a month.
- Lifers.

19:50.326 --> 19:52.536
- Jeez.
- We have a debate to organize here...

19:52.619 --> 19:56.121
and this conversation is veering towards
the subject of French kissing...

19:56.206 --> 19:58.124
and glitter eye shadow: Trashy or trendy?

19:58.166 --> 20:01.627
I have no intention of being humiliated
in front of the whole class...

20:01.669 --> 20:04.129
because we had to study
in the middle of a carnival...

20:04.212 --> 20:06.338
and you two couldn't
keep your eye on the prize.

20:06.423 --> 20:08.966
I want to win and I am going to win.

20:13.220 --> 20:16.806
So, how good of a kisser
is Paul Bunyan anyway?

20:24.688 --> 20:27.857
Okay. Does anybody in town
have a peg leg?

20:28.983 --> 20:31.318
- No.
- Hem these.

20:32.236 --> 20:36.781
- So, tell me more about this Rachel.
- Why are you so curious?

20:36.865 --> 20:39.909
Because everybody in town
knows everything about it...

20:39.993 --> 20:42.703
- and I don't like to be out of the loop.
- It's old news.

20:42.787 --> 20:44.663
Yes, but l'm fascinated. I mean...

20:44.705 --> 20:47.082
I go to Luke's once a day.
Sometimes twice.

20:47.165 --> 20:51.126
Three times if Michel's talked to a relative
and his accent's gotten thicker.

20:51.210 --> 20:54.754
I feel I should know the whole story.
What happened? Where'd she go?

20:54.838 --> 20:59.383
Rachel liked to move around a lot.
She was a very adventurous person.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.427
She loved to climb things,
and fling herself off cliffs...

21:02.512 --> 21:05.097
and dive into these really tiny lakes...

21:05.181 --> 21:08.517
and ride big wild horses, and fly planes.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.352
- So she was Wonder Woman.
- She was to Luke.

21:11.519 --> 21:14.354
- I thought they were gonna get married.
- What happened?

21:14.438 --> 21:17.273
The rumor is that Stars Hollow
was too small for her.

21:17.357 --> 21:19.316
She wanted to live
somewhere more exciting.

21:19.401 --> 21:20.485
But Luke didn't.

21:20.860 --> 21:23.737
You know Luke. Lived here all his life.

21:23.988 --> 21:26.031
He wouldn't even go away to college.

21:26.115 --> 21:29.034
I think we're gonna have to bury him
in that diner.

21:29.951 --> 21:31.535
- It's sad.
- Yeah.

21:31.870 --> 21:35.831
Okay. I am done here.
I'm gonna stop by the Inn for a while.

21:35.873 --> 21:38.875
Then l'm gonna go home
and change for the show tonight.

21:38.959 --> 21:41.878
- We leave at 6:00.
- I will be here. Bye.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.729
We'll need the actual quotes,
so learn them by heart.

22:02.812 --> 22:04.063
What about using notecards?

22:04.147 --> 22:06.565
Notecards look sloppy.
We will know our information.

22:06.649 --> 22:09.359
- But the other teams will use notecards.
- And they'll lose.

22:09.401 --> 22:12.570
- Bye, girls. Rory, see you tonight!
- Bye, Sookie.

22:12.779 --> 22:13.863
What's tonight?

22:13.905 --> 22:16.824
We have tickets to see The Bangles
at the Pastorella theater.

22:16.908 --> 22:18.242
- In New York?
- Yeah.

22:18.284 --> 22:19.952
Sounds potentially not boring.

22:20.035 --> 22:22.161
It's gonna be great. The seats are amazing.

22:22.245 --> 22:24.163
- Who are you going with?
- My mom and Sookie.

22:24.247 --> 22:25.706
- You're kidding.
- What?

22:25.790 --> 22:28.417
- You're going to a concert with your mom?
- Yeah.

22:28.501 --> 22:31.503
I cannot imagine doing anything like that
with my mom.

22:31.587 --> 22:33.421
We do stuff like this all the time.

22:33.463 --> 22:34.964
- Really?
- Yeah.

22:35.340 --> 22:38.134
- How old is your mom, anyway?
- Thirty-two.

22:38.259 --> 22:39.259
Young.

22:39.343 --> 22:41.219
That means she had you when she was...

22:41.262 --> 22:43.722
She had her when she was 16.
We've done the math.

22:43.764 --> 22:46.599
Can we 'ooh' and 'ah' about this quickly
and get to work?

22:46.683 --> 22:50.019
- Sixteen. I'm sixteen.
- So am I.

22:50.102 --> 22:53.021
We're all 16, okay.
Everybody in this room is 16.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.106
- Paris is right. We should work.
- Thank you.

22:55.190 --> 22:58.901
- I can't imagine having a baby at 16.
- Then keep your knees shut.

22:58.943 --> 23:00.319
Very nice.

23:00.528 --> 23:03.113
Do you think your mom is sorry
she got pregnant so young?

23:03.197 --> 23:05.615
- Of course she is.
- Why, thank you.

23:05.866 --> 23:09.285
- I didn't mean that. I just meant...
- I don't think she'd recommend it...

23:09.369 --> 23:11.787
but I think she's happy
with how things turned out.

23:11.871 --> 23:13.705
- I am?
- Yes, you are.

23:13.789 --> 23:17.166
Okay. Just checking.
I'm starving. Is it pizza time yet?

23:17.250 --> 23:18.751
- Are you guys hungry?
- I am.

23:18.835 --> 23:20.419
- I can't eat dairy.
- Okay.

23:20.503 --> 23:22.504
One with cheese, one without. Cokes?

23:22.588 --> 23:24.464
- Yes, please.
- Me, too.

23:25.048 --> 23:26.674
We're never going to finish.

23:26.758 --> 23:29.260
I find your mother completely fascinating.

23:29.552 --> 23:30.719
Funny. So does she.

23:30.803 --> 23:34.139
- It's almost like having a big sister.
- And you like her, don't you?

23:34.223 --> 23:37.642
- She's my best friend.
- Truly, completely fascinating.

23:37.809 --> 23:40.769
- Rory, come in here a sec.
- I'll be right back.

23:45.774 --> 23:47.483
How's it going in there?

23:47.526 --> 23:50.320
- Truly, completely fascinating.
- Really?

23:50.445 --> 23:52.488
We've basically gotten
no work done at all.

23:52.572 --> 23:54.823
Paris is having a meltdown,
which is always fun.

23:54.907 --> 23:55.949
Sounds it.

23:55.991 --> 23:58.993
And, I don't know, we've just been talking.

23:59.035 --> 24:01.495
I think you're actually making
some friends here.

24:01.538 --> 24:02.997
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

24:03.039 --> 24:06.416
They've just moved off the plan
to dump the pig's blood on me at prom.

24:06.500 --> 24:09.919
Talking, chatting, no work being done.
There's friend potential going on.

24:10.003 --> 24:12.338
Maybe. With Louise and Madeline,
at least.

24:12.380 --> 24:15.757
Two out of three
formerly psychotic enemies. Not bad.

24:15.841 --> 24:19.760
There. Pop-Tart appetizers to tide you over
until the pizza comes.

24:19.845 --> 24:21.012
Thanks.

24:22.847 --> 24:24.848
Hey, I have kind of a crazy idea.

24:24.932 --> 24:27.100
That's never comforting, coming from you.

24:27.184 --> 24:28.893
- Consider this, okay?
- Okay.

24:28.977 --> 24:31.854
- We have four tickets to the show tonight.
- Yes, we do.

24:31.896 --> 24:34.690
- What if I give them to you?
- What are you talking about?

24:34.732 --> 24:38.526
Seems like you guys have a bonding thing
going on in there. It might be fun.

24:38.569 --> 24:40.946
- What about you?
- You and I have bonded already.

24:41.029 --> 24:43.948
If we bond any further,
we'll be permanently fused together.

24:44.032 --> 24:46.617
You've talked about the concert
since you heard about it.

24:46.701 --> 24:48.452
- I can still go.
- How?

24:48.535 --> 24:50.661
Sookie and I can buy cheap seats there.

24:50.746 --> 24:53.039
These tickets are ninth row, aisle.
Dream seats.

24:53.081 --> 24:54.540
You don't have to do this.

24:54.582 --> 24:56.875
But you have three years
of Chilton ahead...

24:56.918 --> 24:59.878
and it'll be nice to have friendly people
to talk to there.

24:59.920 --> 25:02.547
You seem to be getting along.
It might be good.

25:02.631 --> 25:06.550
I totally don't mind. I just wanna see
the show. I don't care from what seat.

25:06.634 --> 25:08.927
- Are you sure?
- Completely sure.

25:09.345 --> 25:11.304
- Because l...
- Ladies!

25:14.516 --> 25:16.851
- What are you guys doing tonight?
- Why?

25:17.310 --> 25:20.270
We have these really great tickets
to see The Bangles...

25:20.354 --> 25:22.397
and Rory thought you might like to come.

25:22.481 --> 25:23.982
- Are you serious?
- No way.

25:24.065 --> 25:25.858
Yeah, I mean, if you guys want to.

25:25.900 --> 25:27.943
- I would love to go.
- Count me in.

25:28.027 --> 25:30.612
- Paris, what about you?
- I can't.

25:30.988 --> 25:33.073
- Yes, you can.
- No, I can't.

25:33.156 --> 25:36.241
- Because you're busy doing what?
- I have homework.

25:36.326 --> 25:37.451
She'll be there.

25:37.535 --> 25:38.994
- Good.
- Great.

25:59.137 --> 26:01.722
- He made it.
- Oh, he's handy. How great.

26:01.764 --> 26:03.265
You wear it all the time?

26:03.307 --> 26:05.684
- Just when she's breathing.
- It's a love thing.

26:05.767 --> 26:08.644
- Thanks for the contribution.
- Okay, here.

26:09.604 --> 26:12.272
With these tickets,
you're about to enter sacred space.

26:12.356 --> 26:16.442
You will be treading on hallowed ground.
You will be walking like an Egyptian.

26:16.526 --> 26:17.860
- Mom.
- Take them.

26:17.944 --> 26:20.696
You're gonna have a great time.
The Bangles are the best!

26:20.780 --> 26:24.324
They were my favorite group in
high school. I almost named you Susanna.

26:24.408 --> 26:27.118
The day I found out
you had no musical talent at all...

26:27.160 --> 26:29.245
- was the saddest day of my life.
- Sorry.

26:29.287 --> 26:32.247
You say that now. Here. Okay.

26:32.290 --> 26:34.625
These are probably located...

26:34.708 --> 26:36.292
Hi.

26:36.376 --> 26:38.335
Can you tell me where these seats are?

26:38.420 --> 26:41.255
- Those are right in here.
- Oh, good. Girls.

26:42.465 --> 26:44.883
Here's the deal.
Take your tickets, go to your seats.

26:44.967 --> 26:47.302
Have the night of a lifetime. Bangle it up.

26:47.386 --> 26:51.347
The second the concert is over,
meet us in front of the theater. Got it?

26:51.431 --> 26:53.140
- Yes.
- Good. Now go!

26:55.601 --> 26:58.228
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:00.063 --> 27:03.565
- Okay. Let's go make our noses bleed.
- After you.

27:07.152 --> 27:09.403
- Which aisle is it?
- We're almost there.

27:09.488 --> 27:11.823
I have never sat this close
to a stage before.

27:11.865 --> 27:14.033
I've never really been to a concert before.

27:14.116 --> 27:17.285
So I could be sitting in the back
and say the same thing.

27:17.328 --> 27:19.079
- In here.
- Good.

27:25.126 --> 27:27.294
Wow. These are amazing seats.

27:28.170 --> 27:29.712
Yes, they are.

27:31.047 --> 27:33.632
- What are they looking at?
- One guess.

27:34.884 --> 27:37.135
Check it out, we've got fans.

27:38.178 --> 27:40.471
- Was I right?
- You were right.

27:40.806 --> 27:45.685
And before it's dark, they'll have every
picnic basket that's in Jellystone Park.

27:49.980 --> 27:52.190
- Did you ever see Everest?
- No.

27:52.357 --> 27:53.733
It's a good movie.

27:53.817 --> 27:57.111
We must be getting close.
We're running out of rows.

27:57.486 --> 27:59.154
And 1,000.

27:59.988 --> 28:02.656
- Okay. We're here.
- Great.

28:09.371 --> 28:11.706
Okay. This is fine.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.042
Yep. Not bad at all.

28:15.835 --> 28:16.919
What?

28:19.797 --> 28:22.424
What is so funny?

28:22.883 --> 28:25.885
These are the worst seats
in the entire world.

28:27.387 --> 28:31.015
- They are, aren't they?
- Oh, my God! It's so funny.

28:31.598 --> 28:34.475
- Don't you think this is funny?
- You know, I don't.

28:37.061 --> 28:39.062
I'm sorry.

28:46.111 --> 28:48.529
They're starting! Do you have a lighter?

28:51.073 --> 28:54.909
You mean a flamethrower. Get it?

28:54.993 --> 28:57.411
A flamethrower, 'cause it's so far.

28:57.495 --> 28:59.913
Ladies and gentlemen, The Bangles!

30:55.511 --> 30:57.971
- Was Rachel pretty?
- What?

30:58.222 --> 31:01.516
- I'm just curious. Was she pretty?
- She was pretty.

31:02.851 --> 31:06.687
- What kind of pretty?
- What do you mean?

31:06.729 --> 31:09.856
Was she a Catherine Zeta-Jones
kind of pretty...

31:09.940 --> 31:11.983
or a Michelle Pfeiffery pretty, or...

31:12.025 --> 31:14.485
She was an Elle MacPherson
kind of pretty.

31:14.527 --> 31:16.028
- Really?
- Yep.

31:17.363 --> 31:20.448
- That's an intense kind of pretty.
- You're not kidding.

31:20.908 --> 31:24.452
I never pictured Luke
with an Elle MacPherson kind of pretty.

31:24.536 --> 31:28.539
No? Pictured him more
with a Lorelai Gilmore kind of pretty?

31:29.540 --> 31:33.251
The air up here must be very thin,
because you're delirious.

31:33.335 --> 31:35.253
- And you're jealous.
- What?

31:35.337 --> 31:38.464
- You're jealous of Rachel.
- You're accusing me of being jealous...

31:38.548 --> 31:42.134
of a woman who dumped a man
l'm not even interested in five years ago?

31:42.217 --> 31:44.051
- Yes.
- You don't think that's crazy?

31:44.094 --> 31:47.305
- I do think that's crazy.
- Right, l'm not jealous.

31:47.388 --> 31:48.847
Yeah, you are.

32:01.317 --> 32:04.653
Oh, my God! He is so gorgeous.

32:05.404 --> 32:06.363
I guess.

32:06.446 --> 32:09.240
There's a massive party going on
right around the corner.

32:09.324 --> 32:10.741
- So?
- So they invited us.

32:10.783 --> 32:12.075
- Who?
- Jess and Sean.

32:12.118 --> 32:14.411
We've been talking to them.
They're extremely cool.

32:14.453 --> 32:15.912
- Are we going?
- Going where?

32:15.996 --> 32:17.413
To the party.

32:17.455 --> 32:19.832
- There's a concert going on.
- The band won't miss us.

32:19.916 --> 32:22.751
- We can't just leave, Louise.
- It's America, Rory.

32:22.793 --> 32:25.670
- We have to meet my mom after the show.
- Oh, come on.

32:25.754 --> 32:27.463
What do you mean, 'Oh, come on'?

32:27.547 --> 32:29.840
We have to meet my mother
after the concert.

32:29.924 --> 32:32.009
The band may not miss us,
but Lorelai sure will.

32:32.093 --> 32:33.510
These guys are so cute.

32:33.594 --> 32:36.888
- Great, but we're not going anywhere.
- What, are you afraid?

32:36.930 --> 32:39.890
Of going out into a strange city
with guys I don't know? Yeah.

32:39.933 --> 32:41.434
- Please?
- No!

32:41.934 --> 32:44.436
- Well, we're going.
- No, you're not.

32:45.062 --> 32:47.939
- Paris? Join, please?
- No, thanks.

32:48.273 --> 32:50.983
Fine. Come on, Madeline.

32:51.609 --> 32:53.902
And just what am I supposed
to tell my mother?

32:53.945 --> 32:56.572
That you're a very good little girl.

33:00.617 --> 33:04.787
The party's in a building on the corner
of Waverly and First. Try to get away.

33:05.746 --> 33:08.081
We'll be back
by the time the concert's over.

33:12.627 --> 33:15.170
You know, I really like this band.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.555
- Well?
- I couldn't find Mom or Sookie anywhere.

33:27.806 --> 33:29.432
So what do we do now?

33:29.558 --> 33:32.268
I guess we just wait here
for them to find us.

33:32.602 --> 33:33.686
Okay.

33:34.562 --> 33:37.481
I can't believe Louise and Madeline
would just leave like that.

33:37.565 --> 33:39.650
- They've done it before.
- Nice.

33:39.733 --> 33:41.109
Yeah, well.

33:44.779 --> 33:47.156
- Can I ask you a question?
- Maybe.

33:47.740 --> 33:51.785
- What could you possibly see in Tristan?
- You wouldn't understand.

33:51.993 --> 33:54.203
- Is it just that he's cute?
- Partly.

33:54.287 --> 33:56.705
'Cause there are a lot of cute guys
in the world.

33:56.789 --> 33:58.415
Not like Tristan.

33:58.582 --> 34:01.667
- He's just such a jerk.
- He's not always a jerk.

34:02.002 --> 34:03.253
- No?
- No.

34:03.628 --> 34:04.753
Okay.

34:05.672 --> 34:07.298
When is he not a jerk?

34:07.340 --> 34:09.675
I've known Tristan a really long time.

34:09.757 --> 34:12.176
We've been in the same class
since kindergarten.

34:12.261 --> 34:13.719
- Really?
- Yes.

34:15.429 --> 34:18.681
And, well,
he has things in his life that are hard.

34:18.808 --> 34:21.018
His parents, not so great.

34:21.685 --> 34:23.895
- We have that in common.
- Okay.

34:25.355 --> 34:27.481
- He kissed me once.
- He did?

34:27.857 --> 34:31.318
- Sixth grade. On a dare.
- How romantic.

34:31.360 --> 34:33.445
You just don't know him like I do.

34:33.527 --> 34:37.864
Okay, I believe you.
I just think maybe you could do better.

34:38.866 --> 34:41.868
I know he's flirting with me to get to you...

34:41.952 --> 34:44.161
but at least he's flirting with me.

34:44.204 --> 34:46.121
- Hey.
- There you are.

34:46.206 --> 34:48.456
Think fast. T-shirts for all the girls...

34:48.541 --> 34:51.710
because l'm the Good Witch...
Aren't you missing a couple of kids?

34:51.793 --> 34:53.503
- They left.
- Excuse me?

34:53.587 --> 34:56.297
- Madeline and Louise met these guys...
- What guys?

34:56.380 --> 34:59.466
They were sitting behind us,
and they were having a party.

34:59.550 --> 35:01.343
- Unbelievable!
- What's going on?

35:01.385 --> 35:02.844
- They left.
- What?

35:02.887 --> 35:04.888
Let's go. Come on. Move!

35:11.143 --> 35:15.396
If I leave the house with four girls,
l'm coming home with four girls.

35:16.398 --> 35:19.233
Hi. I'm looking
for a couple of college boys...

35:19.275 --> 35:21.360
who might live here or have friends here.

35:21.402 --> 35:24.237
I don't talk to anybody. People annoy me.

35:27.741 --> 35:30.201
- What?
- She found him with the blonde again.

35:32.328 --> 35:34.830
She's gonna knock on every door
in the entire building?

35:34.914 --> 35:36.248
- Yep.
- Wow.

35:37.249 --> 35:40.710
Hello! Is anyone home?

35:43.421 --> 35:44.546
Hello!

35:46.757 --> 35:48.925
Let's go follow your mother.

35:49.509 --> 35:52.803
I wonder, if I was missing,
if my mom would come looking for me.

35:52.887 --> 35:56.556
- Paris, you know she would.
- Yeah, or at least she'd send somebody.

36:02.270 --> 36:03.938
- Music.
- Let's go.

36:12.028 --> 36:13.362
That's one of the guys.

36:13.446 --> 36:15.572
- Yeah?
- Hi. Could you move, please?

36:15.656 --> 36:17.449
- What?
- Thanks.

36:18.951 --> 36:20.660
Did you miss me?

36:20.744 --> 36:22.036
- Lorelai.
- Ms. Gilmore.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.455
- Put the cups down. Let's move.
- Is there a problem?

36:24.539 --> 36:28.500
Yeah. See those two idiots over there?
They're 16, underage. I bet you're not.

36:28.584 --> 36:31.628
I also bet those big fancy party cups
aren't holding lemonade.

36:31.711 --> 36:36.173
You really want to end any conversation
with me now. So just step aside, Skippy.

36:36.924 --> 36:39.426
Move your asses. Outside, now!

36:48.184 --> 36:50.978
I won't even begin to tell you
how completely insane it is...

36:51.061 --> 36:54.980
to take off with strangers or drink things
that you don't know what's in them...

36:55.023 --> 36:56.941
or act like you have a clue when you don't.

36:56.983 --> 37:01.194
But if you ever pull a stunt like this again,
it will not be around my kid!

37:01.278 --> 37:03.196
- Do you understand me?
- Yes.

37:03.280 --> 37:06.282
Good. Now let's go.
I can't wait to meet your parents.

37:06.366 --> 37:10.619
We have some catching up to do.
I think we'll just talk all night long.

37:13.163 --> 37:17.374
You know what?
I think this is the best night l've ever had.

37:26.841 --> 37:28.467
I cannot believe I missed it.

37:28.509 --> 37:31.011
- The concert was amazing.
- Forget about the concert.

37:31.095 --> 37:34.097
I wanted to see Lorelai pull those idiots
out of that apartment.

37:34.181 --> 37:35.974
It definitely was a Kodak moment.

37:37.183 --> 37:39.101
- You didn't wake me up.
- I set the clock.

37:39.185 --> 37:42.062
But the clock stops ringing
once I throw it against the wall...

37:42.146 --> 37:44.022
giving me ample time to fall back to sleep.

37:44.106 --> 37:47.233
You, however, never stop yapping
no matter how hard I throw you...

37:47.317 --> 37:49.402
thus ensuring the whole wake-up process.

37:49.485 --> 37:51.987
- I'm gonna get a soda. Want anything?
- Gum.

37:52.029 --> 37:54.155
The night of my fourteenth birthday back...

37:54.198 --> 37:58.034
so I could right the
green hot pant-roller disco outfit wrong.

37:58.118 --> 37:59.994
- Coming right up.
- Bye.

38:02.621 --> 38:04.372
So, talk to anybody today?

38:04.456 --> 38:06.749
- You mean Madeline or Louise or Paris?
- Yes.

38:06.833 --> 38:07.958
- No.
- Right.

38:08.043 --> 38:10.169
But I bet school tomorrow
will be interesting.

38:10.253 --> 38:14.089
Oh, yes. Stories of Rory's crazy,
Bangles-obsessed mother...

38:14.173 --> 38:17.550
ripping open apartment doors,
scaring the pointy-haired boys.

38:17.634 --> 38:19.176
Totally uncool, man.

38:19.260 --> 38:22.179
I had to do it, Rory.
They could have gotten hurt.

38:22.221 --> 38:23.430
I know.

38:23.848 --> 38:27.726
I thought inviting those girls out
would make it easier for you at school.

38:27.768 --> 38:30.812
I've always thought 'easy'
is completely overrated.

38:30.895 --> 38:32.229
That's my twisted girl.

38:32.313 --> 38:35.190
Plus Paris decided
to let me split the debate time with her.

38:35.232 --> 38:38.026
Wow! Wait, why am I wowing?

38:38.068 --> 38:40.820
Because splitting debate time with her
is like doing...

38:40.904 --> 38:44.031
that spitting-in-your-palm
and-shaking-hands friendship oath thing.

38:44.115 --> 38:46.867
But way less gross. Good, l'm glad then.

38:48.118 --> 38:50.161
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

38:55.916 --> 38:57.167
Find anything good?

38:57.251 --> 39:00.587
Yeah. I got some refrigerator magnets
shaped like sushi for a nickel.

39:00.629 --> 39:02.839
- So basically I scored.
- Good.

39:03.881 --> 39:06.299
- About what happened the other day...
- Forget it.

39:06.383 --> 39:08.885
- I was a jerk. I didn't mean it.
- I know. Really.

39:08.927 --> 39:10.845
Yeah, well, I am sorry.

39:11.680 --> 39:14.557
- I wanted to give this back to you.
- No. You bought it.

39:14.599 --> 39:18.060
- I know, but it's yours, and I didn't know.
- Didn't know?

39:18.143 --> 39:19.852
About the former owner.

39:19.936 --> 39:22.396
If I had, I wouldn't have flaunted it
in front of you.

39:22.439 --> 39:24.816
It's no big deal.
I was having a bad day, that's it.

39:24.899 --> 39:27.276
Now I got magnetic sushi.
AIl's right with the world.

39:27.359 --> 39:29.652
Okay, good. So here.

39:31.613 --> 39:33.698
It obviously means something to you.

39:33.781 --> 39:36.158
But you have to let things go
eventually, right?

39:36.242 --> 39:39.327
But sometimes you need
a little something to remind you.

39:39.411 --> 39:42.038
You wouldn't want to forget everything,
would you?

39:42.122 --> 39:45.541
No, there was some stuff
I definitely would not want to forget.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.793
So here, so you don't forget.

39:48.544 --> 39:50.795
Thanks. Can I pay you for it?

39:51.088 --> 39:54.465
- In coffee, absolutely.
- All right.

39:58.928 --> 40:00.596
- I'm not pining.
- I know.

40:00.637 --> 40:02.263
- Just remembering.
- Got it.

40:02.306 --> 40:04.724
- Remembering is not pining.
- Absolutely right.

40:04.808 --> 40:08.978
- It's a memento, like restaurant matches.
- I can see the resemblance.

40:09.395 --> 40:10.896
Okay. Good.

40:10.980 --> 40:12.606
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye.
