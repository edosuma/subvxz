00:01.149 --> 00:02.615
<i>Previously on</i> Scream Queens...

00:02.985 --> 00:05.320
Won't this get a little confusing?

00:05.355 --> 00:07.489
<i>You say there are already
two Green Meanies,</i>

00:07.524 --> 00:08.823
so now there's three?

00:10.260 --> 00:11.626
Mm-hmm. Works for me.

00:12.896 --> 00:14.796
Science doesn't lie.

00:14.831 --> 00:17.065
Dr. Holt, you are the prime suspect.

00:19.102 --> 00:21.402
You want to accuse me of
murder, you go right ahead.

00:22.272 --> 00:23.838
But there will be consequences.

00:25.375 --> 00:27.675
<i>Dear God, I'm stressed.</i>

00:28.879 --> 00:30.545
<i>This hospital's popping off,</i>

00:30.580 --> 00:33.014
<i>and I'm one of two
actual doctors on staff.</i>

00:33.049 --> 00:35.049
Dr. Holt, Dean Munsch needs
to see you in her office.

00:35.118 --> 00:36.384
She wouldn't say what it was about.

00:36.419 --> 00:38.019
Dr. Holt, Dr. Cascade
needs you in the E.R.

00:38.054 --> 00:39.587
Something about a joke
that you told him.

00:39.623 --> 00:40.889
He can remember the punch line,

00:40.924 --> 00:42.190
but he can't remember the setup.

00:42.225 --> 00:43.424
<i> Plus, I'm trying
to date that hot slice</i>

00:43.460 --> 00:45.527
<i>of lady pie, Chanel, and everybody</i>

00:45.562 --> 00:47.562
<i>suddenly thinks I'm the Green Meanie.</i>

00:47.597 --> 00:49.097
Dr. Holt, Zayday needs you
in the consultation room.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.365
She just admitted a guy who...

00:50.400 --> 00:51.766
<i>See, the problem is,</i>

00:51.802 --> 00:53.768
<i>the more stressed out I get...</i>

00:53.804 --> 00:56.404
<i>the more stressed out the hand gets.</i>

00:56.439 --> 00:57.839
Dr. Holt?

01:01.878 --> 01:03.745
Tell him I'll be right there.

01:05.348 --> 01:06.948
Sorry.

01:06.983 --> 01:09.117
<i>And the hand used to
belong to a serial killer,</i>

01:09.152 --> 01:12.086
<i>so when it gets stressed, it gets scary.</i>

01:12.122 --> 01:15.423
<i>And lately, it's gotten a lot worse.</i>

01:15.458 --> 01:17.859
<i>See, the hand likes to
do whatever it wants,</i>

01:17.894 --> 01:21.362
<i>and I think it's figured out
that the more worn out I get,</i>

01:21.398 --> 01:22.897
<i>the harder it is to control.</i>

01:22.933 --> 01:25.500
<i>So all it has to do is keep me tired.</i>

01:25.535 --> 01:27.202
<i>- Brocky!</i>
- Damn it!

01:27.237 --> 01:29.137
<i>Wake up. Will you wake up?</i>

01:29.172 --> 01:31.272
No, we're not doing this now.

01:32.642 --> 01:34.776
Sinners, repent,

01:34.811 --> 01:35.977
in Jesus' holy name!

01:36.012 --> 01:38.179
I just want to get some sleep!

01:38.215 --> 01:40.481
<i> I've tried everything,
even meditating.</i>

01:40.517 --> 01:44.552
<i>But the hand refuses to let me relax.</i>

01:44.588 --> 01:47.288
<i>These days, I'm rolling on
45 minutes of sleep a night.</i>

01:47.324 --> 01:48.990
<i>I've got to get on top of this.</i>

01:49.025 --> 01:50.959
<i>I invited Chanel over
for a romantic dinner</i>

01:50.994 --> 01:53.628
<i>because I could really use
a little sooky-sooky.</i>

01:53.663 --> 01:57.098
What the hell is a "large pinch"?

02:01.471 --> 02:03.471
Good evening, Dr. Hot.

02:03.506 --> 02:06.074
Is your hand duct-taped to your leg?

02:07.377 --> 02:09.176
Why, yes, it is, yeah.

02:09.211 --> 02:11.446
Kinky.

02:18.521 --> 02:19.787
Mm.

02:19.823 --> 02:20.822
Wow, this is

02:20.857 --> 02:23.291
really... salty.

02:23.326 --> 02:24.792
Really?

02:24.861 --> 02:26.160
Seems fine to me.

02:26.196 --> 02:27.629
So, enough about me

02:27.664 --> 02:30.131
and that time I punched
Donna Karan in the face.

02:30.166 --> 02:32.267
Um, tell me about you.

02:32.302 --> 02:33.935
I mean, I don't know anything about you.

02:33.970 --> 02:36.004
Like, how old you are,

02:36.039 --> 02:38.806
where you're from, or...
how old you are.

02:39.643 --> 02:41.209
Tell me about your family.

02:41.244 --> 02:42.677
Do you have any siblings?

02:42.712 --> 02:45.947
Or did... did they all die of polio?

02:45.982 --> 02:48.349
I'm so worn out. I mean, the
last thing I want to do

02:48.385 --> 02:50.685
is spend dinner rehashing
my entire life story.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.120
Brock, I mean it!

02:52.188 --> 02:53.288
If you and I want to take

02:53.323 --> 02:54.956
our relationship to the next level,

02:54.991 --> 02:57.859
I need to know who the man
I'm dating really is.

02:57.894 --> 03:00.561
I told you I didn't
want to talk about it!

03:01.665 --> 03:02.864
Oh.

03:02.899 --> 03:04.565
- I'm sorry.
- That's it!

03:04.601 --> 03:06.000
I'm leaving!

03:06.036 --> 03:07.235
No.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.236
Chanel, wait.

03:08.271 --> 03:09.537
Uh-uh. I already have someone

03:09.572 --> 03:11.072
trying to murder me at work.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.874
It is the last thing I need

03:12.909 --> 03:14.042
when I'm sitting down for an elegant

03:14.077 --> 03:16.678
salty dinner and romantic bone sesh.

03:16.713 --> 03:18.646
Chanel!

03:18.682 --> 03:20.748
- Come back!
- No, Brock.

03:20.784 --> 03:22.150
It is over between us!

03:22.185 --> 03:24.385
I am done!

03:24.421 --> 03:25.687
Chanel!

03:25.722 --> 03:26.754
Chanel, come...

03:26.790 --> 03:27.855
<i>Shut up!</i>

03:31.728 --> 03:34.662
<i> Dr. Brock, I'd like you
to meet C.U.R.E. Institute's</i>

03:34.698 --> 03:37.398
most recent admission, Anna Plaisance.

03:37.434 --> 03:40.168
I don't get it. She looks
perfectly normal to me.

03:48.912 --> 03:50.578
Oh, dear God.

03:50.613 --> 03:52.847
Mm.

03:52.882 --> 03:54.849
Nice to meet you, Dr. Holt.

03:54.884 --> 03:56.250
Nice to meet you.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.386
Oh. Okay.

03:58.455 --> 03:59.620
As you can see,

03:59.656 --> 04:02.690
Ms. Plaisance has an extra
set of arms and legs.

04:02.726 --> 04:04.459
No kidding.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.427
The doctors say it's a remnant

04:06.463 --> 04:08.196
of an underdeveloped conjoined twin

04:08.231 --> 04:09.931
that I subsumed in the womb.

04:09.966 --> 04:12.600
Removing a parasitic twin
is an extremely, um,

04:12.635 --> 04:14.402
lengthy and complex operation.

04:14.437 --> 04:16.404
That's why I'm here.
I've done my research,

04:16.439 --> 04:19.107
and you're one of the
best surgeons in America.

04:19.142 --> 04:22.142
And I'd like you to
perform the procedure.

04:22.178 --> 04:26.080
It could be very big for
the hospital, and...

04:26.116 --> 04:28.182
even bigger for you.

04:29.185 --> 04:30.451
Yeah.

04:30.487 --> 04:31.652
Okay.

04:31.688 --> 04:33.721
Let's take a look, huh?

04:34.991 --> 04:36.557
Oh. Wow. Oh.

04:36.593 --> 04:38.960
Okay.

04:38.995 --> 04:40.928
I'm not gonna lie to
you; surgery is an option,

04:40.964 --> 04:42.463
but it's not a very good one.

04:42.499 --> 04:44.399
The twin doesn't have
a head, but there is

04:44.434 --> 04:46.768
a cloaca that never
developed into genitalia.

04:46.803 --> 04:48.503
There's an underdeveloped
set of lungs fused

04:48.538 --> 04:50.171
to the falciform ligament of the liver.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.973
Uh, the femoral artery of the left leg

04:52.008 --> 04:53.775
branches directly off
the hepatic artery.

04:53.810 --> 04:55.943
And the nervous system of the extra arms

04:55.979 --> 04:58.079
branch directly off the
glossopharyngeal nerve,

04:58.114 --> 04:59.580
which is right here.

04:59.616 --> 05:01.315
Now, if we sever that nerve,

05:01.351 --> 05:03.651
then we've paralyzed
her entire left side.

05:03.686 --> 05:05.153
But it is possible.

05:05.188 --> 05:07.255
Yes, it's possible.

05:07.290 --> 05:09.657
That's all I needed to hear,
because I've already contacted

05:09.692 --> 05:11.526
the <i> Northeast Journal of Medicine,</i>

05:11.561 --> 05:14.162
and they have agreed to
send an associate editor

05:14.197 --> 05:15.963
to cover the procedure!

05:15.999 --> 05:17.999
So congratulations, Dr. Holt,

05:18.034 --> 05:20.134
you're about to become a household name.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.770
Hold up, no, I never said
that I could do the surgery.

05:22.806 --> 05:24.138
What are you talking about?

05:24.174 --> 05:26.107
You are always going on and on,

05:26.142 --> 05:28.776
how you are the most skilled
surgeon in North America.

05:28.812 --> 05:31.846
Yeah, and I am, but I just...

05:31.881 --> 05:33.881
I haven't been getting
a lot of sleep lately.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.017
Now, this is no time to be coy.

05:36.052 --> 05:37.185
You're doing the surgery.

05:37.220 --> 05:39.687
But... I can't.

05:39.722 --> 05:40.988
Dr. Holt,

05:41.024 --> 05:42.790
we are one dead body away

05:42.826 --> 05:45.726
from being revealed as the
hospital where patients come,

05:45.762 --> 05:49.330
get cured, and then are brutally
murdered by a serial killer.

05:49.365 --> 05:51.799
Now, I would much rather we were known

05:51.835 --> 05:55.670
as the site of the most high profile

05:55.705 --> 05:58.306
surgical procedures in the last decade.

05:59.409 --> 06:01.676
We need this surgery.

06:43.319 --> 06:45.186
You're like <i> Kill Bill</i> or that dude

06:45.221 --> 06:46.687
who got his head smushed
in on <i> Game of Thrones.</i>

06:46.723 --> 06:48.289
Were you ever hit in
the head really hard

06:48.324 --> 06:49.524
while you were training?

06:49.559 --> 06:51.526
All the time.

06:51.561 --> 06:53.628
You know <i> Karate Kid?</i>

06:53.663 --> 06:55.563
They modeled the guy who ran Cobra Kai

06:55.598 --> 06:57.131
after my sensei.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.100
Why?

06:59.135 --> 07:00.635
I've been trying to find
a medical explanation

07:00.670 --> 07:02.270
as to why you think you're
dead, and I discovered

07:02.338 --> 07:03.771
Cotard's delusion.

07:03.806 --> 07:06.107
Named after a French
neurologist, Jules Cotard.

07:06.142 --> 07:07.708
Basically, people who have
it think they're dead,

07:07.777 --> 07:09.944
or in some cases that they
don't even exist at all.

07:09.979 --> 07:11.479
A traumatic brain injury could be

07:11.514 --> 07:12.747
one of the instigating causes.

07:12.782 --> 07:14.949
Well, I don't have it.

07:14.984 --> 07:16.584
I've had MRls.

07:16.619 --> 07:19.620
Anything like that would have
to be caused by a misfiring

07:19.656 --> 07:22.590
in the fusiform face area of the brain.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.659
Or in the amygdalae.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.228
And there's no signs of trauma
in either of those areas.

07:27.263 --> 07:29.130
So...

07:29.165 --> 07:31.432
It could also be purely psychological.

07:31.467 --> 07:33.434
I think we should give you a
psych test to see if you have

07:33.469 --> 07:35.603
any tendencies that would make
Cotard's a likely diagnosis.

07:35.638 --> 07:37.071
I don't think that's a good idea.

07:37.106 --> 07:38.739
I don't think I can make
a future with a guy

07:38.775 --> 07:39.740
who's actually dead.

07:39.776 --> 07:41.008
Am I supposed to raise

07:41.044 --> 07:42.510
little half-dead, half-alive children?

07:42.545 --> 07:43.945
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
you were prejudiced

07:43.980 --> 07:45.112
against dead people.

07:45.148 --> 07:47.815
Everyone is. I'm just
willing to admit it.

07:47.850 --> 07:51.652
Look, I really like you, but
if we're gonna be a couple,

07:51.688 --> 07:53.454
then I need to know what
your true condition is,

07:53.489 --> 07:56.457
in terms of being living or not living.

08:00.145 --> 08:02.011
There's no official test for Cotard's.

08:02.036 --> 08:04.973
It's not even in the <i> DSM,</i>
so I invented my own.

08:05.333 --> 08:07.333
I researched people who have
been diagnosed with Cotard's

08:07.369 --> 08:10.348
and found a pattern in
their personality types.

08:10.458 --> 08:13.918
Psychosis, neurological
illness, schizophrenia,

08:14.005 --> 08:15.704
and I pulled questions
from a number of sources

08:15.740 --> 08:17.173
that test for those kinds of things.

08:17.208 --> 08:20.543
MMPI, Myers-Briggs,<i> Cosmo.</i>

08:20.578 --> 08:23.879
Honestly, it's the most actual
work I've ever done on anything.

08:23.915 --> 08:26.082
I'm flattered. Let's begin.

08:26.117 --> 08:28.784
everything
in the world is relative."

08:28.820 --> 08:30.386
True.

08:30.421 --> 08:32.688
Mm. Interesting.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.423
Second question.

08:34.458 --> 08:35.691
"You're out with your
girlfriends and you spot

08:35.726 --> 08:36.926
"a cute guy across the bar.

08:36.961 --> 08:38.861
"What do you do? A, smile sweetly?

08:38.895 --> 08:40.496
"B, strike up a conversation?

08:40.530 --> 08:43.332
"C, wink and wait for him to come over?

08:43.366 --> 08:45.167
Your body will do the
rest of the talking."

08:45.203 --> 08:48.204
Um... B, I guess.

08:48.239 --> 08:50.573
How many times do you think
about death or murder in a day?

08:50.608 --> 08:52.908
Um... I don't know, like, 37.

08:54.045 --> 08:55.377
Is that a lot? Yeah.

08:55.413 --> 08:56.612
Maybe less.

08:56.647 --> 08:58.214
Final question of the section.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.616
Which Madonna do you prefer?

09:00.651 --> 09:02.718
<i>Desperately Seeking Susan</i> Madonna.

09:02.753 --> 09:05.020
Obvi.

09:10.228 --> 09:11.193
Is everything okay?

09:11.229 --> 09:12.228
Yes.

09:12.263 --> 09:13.963
Let's move on to phase two.

09:13.998 --> 09:15.731
<i>I can't go if you're watching.</i>

09:15.766 --> 09:17.199
We need to test your urine.

09:17.235 --> 09:18.868
Patients with Cotard's
tend to have a high

09:18.903 --> 09:21.103
serum concentration of CMMG
and weak renal function.

09:21.139 --> 09:23.272
But do you actually have to
watch me give the sample?

09:23.307 --> 09:25.107
We need to be sure that you're
not pulling a Lance Armstrong

09:25.143 --> 09:26.542
and secretly giving us
someone else's pee.

09:26.577 --> 09:28.043
<i>All you need to do is</i>

09:28.079 --> 09:29.411
tell me if the things I'm showing you

09:29.447 --> 09:30.613
in the slides are dead or alive.

09:35.353 --> 09:36.352
Dead.

09:38.055 --> 09:39.088
Alive.

09:41.259 --> 09:42.391
Dead?

09:44.829 --> 09:46.562
I don't know who that is.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.331
I don't know, I don't know.

09:49.367 --> 09:51.033
G-Guys I'm done with this.
I'm not doing it anymore.

10:02.647 --> 10:05.114
What do the results say?

10:05.149 --> 10:08.150
ScarJo is your spirit celebrity,
and, yes, you have Cotard's.

10:08.186 --> 10:10.486
What? I do?

10:10.521 --> 10:13.122
Wait, so I'm not actually dead?

10:14.625 --> 10:16.926
I'm alive?

10:16.961 --> 10:19.628
Thank God, I'm still alive.

10:19.664 --> 10:22.331
But wait, how do you
explain how cold I am?

10:22.366 --> 10:23.999
People psychosomatically
manifest symptoms of a disease

10:24.035 --> 10:25.801
if they truly believe they have it.

10:25.836 --> 10:28.137
They've been known to develop
tumors, skin conditions

10:28.172 --> 10:29.939
or even paralysis.

10:29.974 --> 10:32.541
Also, you sleep in a water bed
next to a giant air conditioner.

10:33.511 --> 10:35.010
This must be a lot to take in.

10:35.046 --> 10:37.213
Maybe you should go home and
take a rest on your water bed

10:37.248 --> 10:38.514
and we can talk about this later.

10:38.549 --> 10:41.951
Thank you, Number Three.
You saved my life.

10:57.935 --> 10:59.635
I didn't give him all the results.

10:59.670 --> 11:00.836
According to the testing,

11:00.871 --> 11:02.571
not only is Dr. Cassidy Cascade

11:02.607 --> 11:04.974
more likely to want to be in
the front during spooning,

11:05.009 --> 11:06.775
he's also a psychopath.

11:07.912 --> 11:10.079
And his most likely profession...

11:10.114 --> 11:11.680
is serial killer.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.918
Wait, so this means that...

11:15.953 --> 11:17.353
Cassidy might be...

11:17.388 --> 11:19.154
The Green Meanie.

11:21.192 --> 11:24.293
It seems like all of us
Chanels are just doomed

11:24.328 --> 11:26.695
to a life of romantic tragedy.

11:26.731 --> 11:28.430
But it's gonna be okay.

11:28.466 --> 11:30.933
Because as soon as you turn
Cassidy in to the police...

11:32.036 --> 11:33.402
the three of us can start

11:33.437 --> 11:36.505
enjoying the freedom of not
living our lives worrying about

11:36.540 --> 11:38.540
being slaughtered by some serial killer.

11:38.576 --> 11:40.242
And get back to the good old days:

11:40.278 --> 11:42.845
the three of us against the world.

11:42.880 --> 11:44.913
Young women bonding over a shared sense

11:44.949 --> 11:47.950
of mutual affection, humor.

11:47.985 --> 11:50.185
It was never like that.
That sounds awful.

11:51.455 --> 11:52.521
And maybe I won't turn him in.

11:52.556 --> 11:54.423
What? Uh, he's a murderer.

11:54.458 --> 11:56.859
Maybe, for once, I don't want
to have to do the right thing

11:56.894 --> 11:58.193
for the good of everyone else.

11:58.229 --> 12:00.562
Um... when have you ever done that?

12:00.598 --> 12:03.432
Just for once, why can't it
be about me and my needs?

12:03.467 --> 12:05.934
When is it Number Three's
turn to be happy?

12:13.311 --> 12:14.710
<i>Psst. Psst.</i>

12:14.745 --> 12:15.878
<i>Wake up.</i>

12:18.416 --> 12:20.115
<i>Psst, psst, psst. Brocky!</i>

12:20.151 --> 12:22.584
<i>Will you wake up?</i>

12:24.455 --> 12:26.388
<i>I said wake up.</i>

12:26.424 --> 12:27.656
Damn it!

12:27.692 --> 12:29.825
I've just got to sleep.

12:29.860 --> 12:32.628
<i>No sleep for you. I want to play.</i>

12:33.664 --> 12:35.264
Aah!

12:35.299 --> 12:38.167
All right. That's it. I
can't live like this.

12:38.202 --> 12:40.736
I don't care about my
surgical career anymore.

12:40.771 --> 12:43.972
I just want you gone!

12:46.277 --> 12:47.776
<i>What are you doing?</i>

12:47.812 --> 12:50.579
Something I should've
done a long time ago.

12:50.614 --> 12:52.848
<i>Missed me.</i>

12:54.685 --> 12:56.452
Stop moving! Yeah.

12:56.487 --> 12:57.753
Laugh it up, funny boy.

13:00.658 --> 13:02.491
<i>You missed me, you dummy.</i>

13:02.526 --> 13:04.793
<i>You can't kill me.</i>

13:04.829 --> 13:07.162
<i>It's you and me forever.</i>

13:08.733 --> 13:10.666
<i>You might want to look behind you.</i>

13:17.908 --> 13:19.108
<i>Don't worry.</i>

13:19.143 --> 13:20.476
<i>I got this.</i>

13:21.345 --> 13:22.678
<i>Take that.</i>

13:28.719 --> 13:29.685
What's going on?

13:29.720 --> 13:31.453
<i>White Crane Kung Fu.</i>

13:31.489 --> 13:32.855
<i>That's what.</i>

13:39.196 --> 13:40.796
<i>Whee!</i>

13:53.944 --> 13:55.711
I can't believe it.

13:55.746 --> 13:57.312
You saved my life.

13:57.348 --> 13:59.081
<i>Of course I did, silly.</i>

14:00.251 --> 14:02.317
<i>It's you and me forever.</i>

14:04.121 --> 14:06.555
Thanks so much for letting
me ramble on like this.

14:06.590 --> 14:08.690
You're such a good listener,
and I really don't have

14:08.726 --> 14:11.260
anyone else I can talk to...

14:11.295 --> 14:12.594
Myrtle.

14:12.630 --> 14:14.663
I'm in love with the Green Meanie,

14:14.698 --> 14:16.665
and I don't know what to do about it.

14:16.700 --> 14:18.500
I bribed Number Five
with delicious candy

14:18.536 --> 14:20.769
so she wouldn't say anything, but...

14:20.805 --> 14:22.704
maybe I should just turn him in.

14:22.740 --> 14:25.374
I mean, on one hand,
he is killing people,

14:25.409 --> 14:27.276
which is, like, not great.

14:27.311 --> 14:30.879
But in a Malthusian sense, this
planet <i> is</i> teeming with people,

14:30.915 --> 14:34.716
so he is sort of thinning
the herd in a helpful way.

14:34.785 --> 14:38.420
But let's just say we
fall madly in love.

14:38.456 --> 14:41.423
That'll protect me for a
while, but what about

14:41.459 --> 14:44.193
when the honeymoon's over
and the romance wears off?

14:44.228 --> 14:48.530
Maybe he'll get bored with me
and decide to chop off my head.

14:48.566 --> 14:51.233
But maybe...

14:51.302 --> 14:53.035
that's great incentive
for me to make sure

14:53.070 --> 14:55.137
that the romance doesn't wear off.

14:55.172 --> 14:56.638
Maybe that's exactly the motivation

14:56.674 --> 14:58.740
our relationship needs.

15:02.246 --> 15:03.979
Thank you so much, Myrtle.

15:04.014 --> 15:06.048
I guess I've got a lot
of thinking to do.

15:06.083 --> 15:08.484
You have no idea how
much this means to me.

15:10.688 --> 15:13.121
I'll make sure no one
defiles your corpse.

15:17.628 --> 15:19.928
Very interesting.

15:19.964 --> 15:21.396
This is something I've
never seen before.

15:22.566 --> 15:23.966
Please, Doctor, you have to help us.

15:24.001 --> 15:25.467
There's something very
wrong with my boyfriend,

15:25.503 --> 15:27.302
and we have no idea what it is.

15:27.338 --> 15:29.137
Um, it's obvious what's
wrong with your boyfriend.

15:29.173 --> 15:30.572
Your boyfriend has horrible acne.

15:30.608 --> 15:31.673
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.308
Jessica Simpson had terrible acne

15:33.344 --> 15:35.511
and inexplicably chose to
make a commercial about it.

15:35.546 --> 15:37.012
I don't think

15:37.047 --> 15:38.981
Mr. Benderhall has acne.

15:39.016 --> 15:41.016
Okay, then he <i> had</i> acne.

15:41.051 --> 15:42.684
Again, nothing to be ashamed of.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.820
Edward James Olmos had
terrible acne, too.

15:44.855 --> 15:46.655
He's got more pock marks than
the moon, but I feel like

15:46.690 --> 15:48.824
he wears it like a badge
of pride, and frankly,

15:48.859 --> 15:51.193
I think he gets more work because of it.

15:51.228 --> 15:52.861
It's not just his skin.

15:52.897 --> 15:54.663
He has abdominal pain,

15:54.698 --> 15:56.265
nausea, vomiting.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.767
The doctor said it was a
really bad stomach flu,

15:58.802 --> 16:00.435
but he hasn't even had a fever.

16:00.471 --> 16:02.504
I read about this place in the paper,

16:02.540 --> 16:04.840
that people come here
with incurable diseases.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.875
Do you think that's what this is?

16:06.911 --> 16:08.877
When did the symptoms first start?

16:08.913 --> 16:10.946
A few weeks ago.

16:10.981 --> 16:13.782
Well, um, we can rule out smallpox.

16:13.817 --> 16:15.450
You'd already be dead.

16:15.486 --> 16:17.286
Dr. Cascade? Dr....

16:17.593 --> 16:20.327
Number Three. My name is Dr.
Number Three.

16:23.227 --> 16:26.361
Thomas is the greatest thing
that has ever happened to me.

16:26.397 --> 16:28.664
I love this man more than I love myself,

16:28.699 --> 16:29.831
and I cannot be without him.

16:29.867 --> 16:31.633
Do you understand me?
He's my everything.

16:31.669 --> 16:32.868
You have to help us!

16:32.903 --> 16:34.503
Shelly.

16:34.538 --> 16:36.805
I'm gonna make you a promise right now.

16:36.840 --> 16:39.908
I'm gonna find out what's
wrong with your boyfriend,

16:39.944 --> 16:41.510
and then I'm gonna cure him.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.145
Dr. Cascade, thank you.

16:43.180 --> 16:46.148
It's the selfless dedication
of people like you

16:46.183 --> 16:48.684
that make me believe that true love can

16:48.719 --> 16:50.752
maybe really survive in this

16:50.788 --> 16:54.990
scary and unpredictable world.

16:55.025 --> 16:58.827
Number Three, Number Five,
Neckbrace, my dear sweet idiots,

16:58.862 --> 17:00.829
I need some advice.

17:00.864 --> 17:02.364
You know how Brock's hand
sometimes tries to kill me

17:02.399 --> 17:03.565
because he got it off a murderer?

17:03.601 --> 17:05.901
- What?!
- Um, no. You never told us that.

17:05.935 --> 17:07.269
Okay, well, it does and he did.

17:07.304 --> 17:09.371
Anyway, when I was walking
home the other night

17:09.406 --> 17:11.006
from his house, after telling
him that I never wanted

17:11.040 --> 17:13.175
to speak to him again and
that it was over between us,

17:13.210 --> 17:15.277
I was, like, "No." I am going back

17:15.311 --> 17:17.346
to my hot doctor boyfriend's
house, and I'm gonna ask him

17:17.381 --> 17:19.247
why he keeps trying to kill me!

17:19.282 --> 17:20.515
And you know what he said?

17:20.550 --> 17:22.050
He said it's just because he's stressed.

17:22.086 --> 17:23.785
When he's worn out, it's harder for him

17:23.820 --> 17:25.387
to control the hand's homicidal rage,

17:25.422 --> 17:27.289
but he also said that figuring out a way

17:27.324 --> 17:30.292
not to murder me is gonna
be his top priority.

17:30.327 --> 17:32.728
Chanel, you totally did the right thing.

17:32.763 --> 17:35.631
He's a hot doctor. He
deserves another chance.

17:35.666 --> 17:38.567
Thank you. I
mean, I am so relieved.

17:38.602 --> 17:39.868
Wait, is that your advice?

17:41.472 --> 17:45.240
Chanel, he's obviously
gonna try and kill you.

17:45.275 --> 17:47.042
You're in mortal danger.

17:47.077 --> 17:48.210
You wouldn't understand, Number Five.

17:48.245 --> 17:49.578
I mean, you've never had a boyfriend.

17:49.613 --> 17:51.813
Yes, I have.

17:51.849 --> 17:54.616
His name was Tyler and he was
murdered, like, three weeks ago.

17:55.853 --> 17:56.952
So much weird stuff happens to us,

17:56.987 --> 17:58.387
I can honestly say I
totally forgot about that.

17:59.456 --> 18:00.622
Chanel.

18:00.658 --> 18:02.724
Even though I refuse to tell
you who the killer is...

18:02.760 --> 18:04.426
but let me just remind you all

18:04.461 --> 18:07.462
that it is a fact that
I do know... I can say

18:07.498 --> 18:10.399
that you would probably be
comfortable dating Brock.

18:10.434 --> 18:12.300
Even though he has the hand of
psycho killer, I can't promise

18:12.336 --> 18:14.002
that he's not gonna try and kill you,

18:14.038 --> 18:16.405
but suffice it to say, I don't think

18:16.440 --> 18:18.807
that he's the Green Meanie type.

18:18.842 --> 18:20.475
Okay. Hold on.

18:20.511 --> 18:22.110
If you're gonna start giving us hints,

18:22.146 --> 18:24.513
why don't you just tell us
who the killer is, now?

18:24.548 --> 18:28.483
Why doesn't Number Three
tell us who the killer is?

18:30.888 --> 18:33.121
How's your love life been lately?

18:33.157 --> 18:35.123
None of your business.

18:54.144 --> 18:55.310
<i>Excusez.</i>

18:57.715 --> 18:59.381
We're making our move.

18:59.416 --> 19:01.483
I need Dr. Holt's password.

19:01.518 --> 19:03.018
Password?

19:03.053 --> 19:04.386
What... which one?

19:04.421 --> 19:05.721
It doesn't matter; most Americans

19:05.756 --> 19:07.389
use the same password for everything.

19:07.424 --> 19:08.990
What are you gonna do with it?

19:09.026 --> 19:10.625
I'm going to annoy him.

19:10.661 --> 19:12.527
I happen to know that Brock's hand

19:12.563 --> 19:14.696
wants to kill Chanel as much as I do.

19:14.732 --> 19:16.064
And he loses control of it

19:16.100 --> 19:17.899
the more stressed out he gets.

19:17.935 --> 19:21.403
Yeah. About that, um...

19:21.438 --> 19:25.540
I guess I'd be lying if I said I
wasn't feeling guilty about...

19:25.576 --> 19:27.109
murdering people.

19:27.144 --> 19:29.578
We're not talking about
murdering <i> people.</i>

19:29.613 --> 19:31.713
We're talking about murdering Chanel,

19:31.749 --> 19:34.082
the bitch that burned
my sister's face off.

19:35.119 --> 19:36.485
So, if you're asking me

19:36.520 --> 19:39.187
if I think she deserves
to die, my answer is yes.

19:39.223 --> 19:40.422
I believe she does.

19:41.592 --> 19:42.991
Just give me the password.

19:43.026 --> 19:45.861
Well, I-I did see him sign
into his e-mail once.

19:50.467 --> 19:53.268
His password is "I went to Harvard"?

19:53.303 --> 19:55.737
Yeah. All caps.

19:55.773 --> 19:57.873
Excellent.

19:57.908 --> 19:59.708
Once Chanel is dead,
we'll pick off the rest

19:59.743 --> 20:01.243
of the Chanels one-by-one,

20:01.278 --> 20:03.178
starting with that bitch Number Three.

20:03.213 --> 20:05.013
I mean, that earmuff thing

20:05.048 --> 20:06.615
is so obnoxious.

20:06.650 --> 20:09.518
It's not even cold out!

20:09.553 --> 20:11.553
I'm not killing Chanel #3.

20:14.658 --> 20:16.625
Oh, yes, you are.

20:16.660 --> 20:19.227
I'll turn you in if you don't,
and I'll be the last face

20:19.263 --> 20:21.963
you see when you fry
in the electric chair.

20:22.444 --> 20:24.744
That is a solemn promise.

20:37.617 --> 20:39.469
I want to cancel my subscription.

20:39.494 --> 20:43.096
No. Do not put me on hold.
Do not... Hello?

20:43.237 --> 20:44.270
Damn it!

20:45.974 --> 20:46.846
Excuse me, Dr. Holt.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.437
What?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.158
You seem a little harried.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.559
Yeah, I <i> am</i> harried.

20:51.768 --> 20:53.435
My cable package is messed up.

20:53.470 --> 20:56.238
I tried to watch TV last night,
and every single channel,

20:56.273 --> 20:59.103
24/7, is Major League Soccer.

20:59.416 --> 21:01.616
And I can't even use my
computer anymore, look.

21:01.652 --> 21:03.785
10,000 pop-up ads for male enhancement.

21:03.820 --> 21:07.389
Did you, uh, handcuff
yourself to that desk?

21:07.424 --> 21:08.423
Yes.

21:08.458 --> 21:09.958
As a matter of fact, I did.

21:09.993 --> 21:12.527
Well, I just came in to let you know

21:12.562 --> 21:14.095
Dean Munsch has been looking for you.

21:14.131 --> 21:15.630
Oh, and I believe here he is.

21:15.666 --> 21:20.802
Dr. Holt, this is Slade Hornborn.

21:20.837 --> 21:22.203
He's doing the profile on you

21:22.239 --> 21:23.638
for the <i> Northeast Journal of Medicine.</i>

21:23.674 --> 21:25.473
Are you handcuffed to that desk?

21:25.509 --> 21:27.275
I am. You know what they say

21:27.311 --> 21:29.311
we're
slaves to our work.

21:29.346 --> 21:30.812
I didn't know they said that.

21:30.847 --> 21:32.981
Do you
ever wish you were bigger?

21:33.016 --> 21:34.949
Try natural male enhan...

21:36.019 --> 21:37.819
I'm Dr. Brock Holt.

21:38.989 --> 21:41.089
I'm so sorry.

21:41.124 --> 21:43.758
Where I'm from, that's
how we greet people

21:43.794 --> 21:44.959
that we really admire.

21:44.995 --> 21:45.960
And where is that?

21:45.996 --> 21:47.595
Baltimore.

21:47.631 --> 21:49.497
I'm from there, too.

21:50.367 --> 21:52.600
It's an old Baltimorean custom.

21:52.636 --> 21:54.302
Yeah. Now that the introductions

21:54.338 --> 21:55.670
are out of the way,

21:55.706 --> 21:57.972
why don't you give Mr. Hornborn here

21:58.008 --> 21:59.641
an overview of the procedure

21:59.676 --> 22:01.943
you're about to perform
on the polymelia.

22:01.978 --> 22:03.178
We're not doing the procedure.

22:05.215 --> 22:07.349
But you said you could do the surgery.

22:07.384 --> 22:09.284
I said it's possible, and it is,

22:09.319 --> 22:10.785
but not for this patient.

22:10.821 --> 22:12.821
Her heart is too weak
to go through surgery.

22:12.856 --> 22:14.456
Her blood work just came back.

22:14.491 --> 22:17.125
She is C-stage heart failure.

22:17.160 --> 22:19.327
Probably worn out from
all that extra work,

22:19.363 --> 22:20.462
pumping blood to those four extra limbs

22:20.497 --> 22:21.663
for the last 30 years.

22:22.733 --> 22:24.632
Um...

22:24.668 --> 22:26.968
we are gonna move forward
with the procedure.

22:27.003 --> 22:28.269
- No.
- Yes.

22:28.305 --> 22:31.306
You said that the patient was
in C-stage heart failure.

22:35.679 --> 22:38.113
That will kill her in five
years no matter what.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.015
So we are going to perform
a heart transplant

22:41.051 --> 22:43.485
along with removing the parasitic twin

22:43.520 --> 22:45.286
and saving her life in the process.

22:45.322 --> 22:49.457
It will go down as the
most spectacular surgery

22:49.493 --> 22:51.693
in modern medical history.

22:51.728 --> 22:53.361
Where are you gonna get a heart?

22:53.397 --> 22:55.296
People sit on transplant
lists for years.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.831
You just leave that to me.

22:56.867 --> 22:58.967
Mr. Hornborn, why don't I show you

22:59.002 --> 23:00.702
the rest of the facility.

23:09.413 --> 23:12.213
Number Three.

23:12.249 --> 23:13.314
Put this on.

23:15.385 --> 23:18.253
Your boyfriend is being
poisoned by the Russians.

23:18.288 --> 23:19.154
What?

23:19.189 --> 23:20.522
That seems insane.

23:20.557 --> 23:22.490
- I don't know any Russians.
- Uh-huh.

23:22.526 --> 23:25.160
That's probably what this guy said.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.363
Victor Yushchenko, former
president of Ukraine.

23:28.398 --> 23:30.865
He used to look like this.

23:30.901 --> 23:33.735
Until he pushed for Ukraine's
membership into NATO,

23:33.770 --> 23:37.472
and the KGB slipped
dioxin into his food.

23:37.507 --> 23:38.573
Dioxin?

23:38.608 --> 23:41.576
Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, to be exact.

23:41.611 --> 23:45.380
Um, it's a byproduct of
various industrial processes,

23:45.415 --> 23:47.449
and an ingredient in Agent Orange

23:47.484 --> 23:49.083
used during the Vietnam War.

23:49.119 --> 23:50.418
What does this mean?

23:50.454 --> 23:52.554
It means we need to
quarantine your boyfriend

23:52.589 --> 23:54.522
and get you out of
this room immediately.

23:54.558 --> 23:55.590
If the dose was as large

23:55.625 --> 23:57.058
as I think it may have been,

23:57.093 --> 23:58.693
you yourself risk poisoning.

23:58.728 --> 24:00.762
I-I'm not going anywhere.

24:00.797 --> 24:02.630
I'm not gonna leave my boyfriend's side.

24:02.666 --> 24:04.532
You promised me that you
would find a cure for him,

24:04.568 --> 24:06.234
and I expect you to make
good on your promise.

24:06.269 --> 24:08.703
Until you do, I'm not leaving this room.

24:17.080 --> 24:19.113
I guess this is what
true love looks like.

24:19.149 --> 24:20.748
I just don't get it.

24:20.784 --> 24:23.051
I mean, if she stays
in that room with him,

24:23.086 --> 24:25.787
she puts her own health at risk.

24:25.822 --> 24:28.590
I don't know who it helps
for her to die, too.

24:28.625 --> 24:32.160
Maybe because you've never felt
the warm embrace of real love.

24:32.195 --> 24:34.462
There's something I need to tell you.

24:34.531 --> 24:36.164
I made a decision.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.666
So have I.

24:38.702 --> 24:40.401
Let's say them out
loud at the same time.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.136
One...

24:42.172 --> 24:45.592
two... three. I'm the Green
Meanie and I'm in love with you.

24:45.617 --> 24:46.508
I know you're the Green Meanie,
and I'm in love with you.

24:46.543 --> 24:47.809
And I've decided I'm not
I'm not going to kill you.

24:47.844 --> 24:49.177
I'm gonna love and support
you unconditionally.

24:49.212 --> 24:52.080
- I'm just gonna kill Chanel.
- Wait, what?

24:52.115 --> 24:54.215
I'm in love with you.

24:54.251 --> 24:55.350
No.

24:55.385 --> 24:58.186
I heard that, which is great.

24:58.221 --> 25:01.022
But I just wonder if you
could maybe not kill Chanel.

25:01.057 --> 25:03.091
See, I get that, but...

25:03.126 --> 25:05.193
I have to tell you, that's
kind of controlling.

25:06.663 --> 25:09.197
I just want to help you
be a better person.

25:09.232 --> 25:11.099
Namely, getting you to
stop murdering people.

25:11.134 --> 25:13.968
I know I'm the last person to
help someone be a better person,

25:14.004 --> 25:16.604
since I'm admittedly not a very
good or nice person myself,

25:16.640 --> 25:18.773
but... I'm not a killer.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.643
So I know I can at least
help you try to not be that.

25:21.711 --> 25:23.044
How?

25:23.079 --> 25:24.646
We're gonna start by distracting you

25:24.681 --> 25:26.447
from thinking about murdering people

25:26.483 --> 25:29.117
by figuring out how Mr. Benderhall

25:29.152 --> 25:30.685
is getting poisoned.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.191
Yes, Mom, I'm
working in a hospital.

25:37.227 --> 25:38.793
Crazy, right?

25:38.828 --> 25:40.728
Yeah, I'm a nurse.

25:40.764 --> 25:42.330
Yeah, me, too.

25:42.365 --> 25:45.066
I came to see someone about
my intestines thing,

25:45.101 --> 25:48.336
and they just hired
me right on the spot.

25:48.371 --> 25:51.539
I actually don't know what my salary is.

25:51.575 --> 25:55.176
I haven't been paid yet, which is weird.

25:55.211 --> 25:58.179
Oh, oh, and they made me a Chanel.

25:58.214 --> 26:00.081
Yeah, I didn't know
what that meant either,

26:00.116 --> 26:03.384
but I think it just means
being a bitch all the time.

26:05.555 --> 26:07.021
Yeah.

26:08.558 --> 26:10.258
Yeah.

26:40.817 --> 26:41.957
<i>She's brain-dead.</i>

26:42.035 --> 26:44.302
Even a Republican legislature in Florida

26:44.337 --> 26:46.804
would be cool with us pulling the plug.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.006
Are you sure these organ
donor forms are legit?

26:49.042 --> 26:50.141
The ink is smudging.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.510
How fortuitous for us

26:52.545 --> 26:55.479
that we needed a donor for
our surgery on Ms. Plaisance

26:55.515 --> 26:58.316
and the Green Meanie
just decided to suddenly

26:58.351 --> 27:00.451
start only mostly killing people.

27:00.486 --> 27:01.452
Mm-hmm.

27:01.487 --> 27:02.453
Yes, it's really remarkable.

27:02.488 --> 27:03.487
Number Ten's heart

27:03.523 --> 27:05.790
was completely undamaged by the attack,

27:05.825 --> 27:07.191
and she is a perfect match.

27:07.227 --> 27:08.492
Yeah, it makes you wonder what we did

27:08.528 --> 27:09.660
to deserve such luck, right?

27:09.696 --> 27:11.495
Although, wasn't it Hemingway who said,

27:11.531 --> 27:12.830
"You make your own luck"?

27:14.234 --> 27:16.234
Dr. Holt, what are you doing?

27:18.738 --> 27:20.137
I'm late for my rounds.

27:23.376 --> 27:24.842
Whenever the med students on <i> House</i>

27:24.878 --> 27:26.143
checked out a patient's life

27:26.179 --> 27:27.712
to figure out what was wrong with them,

27:27.747 --> 27:30.581
it always seemed more
dramatic and exciting.

27:30.617 --> 27:32.416
I went by their house this morning

27:32.452 --> 27:34.218
to do some investigating.

27:34.254 --> 27:37.588
I took all these photos to see
if we could find any clues.

27:37.624 --> 27:39.323
They're tidy people.

27:39.359 --> 27:41.058
Were there any sex toys
in their nightstand?

27:41.094 --> 27:42.526
I don't trust anyone who doesn't have

27:42.562 --> 27:44.228
at least one sex toy
in their nightstand.

27:44.264 --> 27:45.329
- Mm.
- How do they pay

27:45.365 --> 27:46.931
- for all this?
- Hmm. Good question.

27:47.967 --> 27:49.333
Mm...

27:49.369 --> 27:51.269
well, he's definitely the moneymaker.

27:51.304 --> 27:52.870
Lawyer.

27:52.906 --> 27:56.207
She's a receptionist
at Nice Guy Chemicals.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.842
Nice Guy Chemicals?

27:57.877 --> 27:59.076
It's odd, but with a name like that,

27:59.112 --> 28:00.578
I feel like they must be doing good work

28:00.613 --> 28:01.946
and not poisoning the environment.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.448
They're best known for their
work with the Syrian army,

28:04.484 --> 28:08.953
to create an organic, non-GMO TCDD.

28:08.988 --> 28:11.122
What is that? Like, a food additive?

28:11.157 --> 28:12.556
It's dioxin.

28:12.592 --> 28:14.692
The stuff he's being poisoned with.

28:14.727 --> 28:18.296
Shelly would have access to
as much of it as she wanted,

28:18.331 --> 28:21.933
but she'd only need a little
bit to poison her boyfriend

28:21.968 --> 28:23.768
and keep him sick all the time.

28:23.803 --> 28:26.037
Why would she do that?

28:26.072 --> 28:28.472
Munchausen syndrome by proxy.

28:28.508 --> 28:31.809
It's when you make someone
sick so you can get sympathy

28:31.844 --> 28:33.177
for taking care of them.

28:33.212 --> 28:35.246
It's most common

28:35.281 --> 28:38.082
in overly anxious or
unappreciated mothers.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.284
They'll either lie about
their children being sick

28:40.320 --> 28:43.754
or sometimes go as far as
to actually make them ill.

28:43.790 --> 28:44.956
Why would I do that?

28:44.991 --> 28:46.757
I love Thomas; he's my whole life.

28:46.793 --> 28:48.225
For attention, for sympathy.

28:48.261 --> 28:49.393
Or maybe

28:49.429 --> 28:51.095
you thought he was gonna leave you,

28:51.130 --> 28:53.764
so you wanted to weaken him
enough to keep him around.

28:53.800 --> 28:56.100
No, I love him. I would never
do anything to hurt him.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.669
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have
to inform the authorities.

28:58.705 --> 29:00.171
She isn't poisoning me.

29:00.206 --> 29:01.839
I've been poisoning myself.

29:02.942 --> 29:06.477
She is driving me insane.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.280
I wasn't looking to get
serious with anybody, really.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.414
But Shelly was just

29:10.450 --> 29:12.850
so pushy and clingy,

29:12.885 --> 29:15.419
and all of a sudden, she's
just moving in with me.

29:15.455 --> 29:17.588
And organizing everything.

29:17.623 --> 29:20.257
Every fork or thumbtack

29:20.293 --> 29:21.258
or cotton ball!

29:21.294 --> 29:22.460
You know, she won't let me

29:22.495 --> 29:24.195
keep sex toys in the bedside table.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.863
You can't trust someone who does that.

29:26.966 --> 29:28.666
Why didn't you tell me any of this?

29:28.701 --> 29:30.267
Because you're just

29:30.303 --> 29:32.670
so fragile and weird,

29:32.705 --> 29:33.938
and I just thought if I told you,

29:33.973 --> 29:35.539
that you'd freak out.

29:35.575 --> 29:38.109
So, I bought some
dioxin on the deep web,

29:38.144 --> 29:39.610
and I just thought that
if I got really sick

29:39.645 --> 29:42.279
and ugly that you would
just get turned off

29:42.315 --> 29:43.714
and that you would leave,

29:43.750 --> 29:45.783
but it just made you
be around even more.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.618
And, doctors, please,

29:47.653 --> 29:48.686
you have to help me.

29:48.721 --> 29:50.621
I can't spend one more day with her.

29:58.498 --> 29:59.997
Wow.

30:00.033 --> 30:02.066
What?

30:02.101 --> 30:05.503
I decided not to turn you in
because I believed in true love.

30:05.538 --> 30:08.172
But now that I know that Mr.
Benderhall was living a lie,

30:08.207 --> 30:09.540
I don't know what to believe.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.011
Maybe I'll just have to turn you in.

30:14.047 --> 30:16.647
Well, maybe I'll just have to kill you.

30:24.624 --> 30:26.891
I need to talk to you.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.093
- Is that your blood?
- No.

30:29.128 --> 30:30.861
Is it the blood of someone
who could be referred to

30:30.897 --> 30:31.862
as a murder victim?

30:31.898 --> 30:33.697
- No.
- Last question:

30:33.733 --> 30:36.834
Is it the blood of someone who
is vital to you performing

30:36.869 --> 30:38.202
this very important surgery

30:38.237 --> 30:39.937
that I am counting on you to perform?

30:39.972 --> 30:41.272
No, it's the blood of a patient.

30:41.307 --> 30:42.940
I was doing a simple knee replacement,

30:42.975 --> 30:44.108
and my hand got all cuckoo

30:44.143 --> 30:45.943
and stabbed the patient
in the femoral artery.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.179
Luckily, I got control long
enough to stop the bleeding,

30:48.214 --> 30:50.581
but I can't perform
this complex operation

30:50.616 --> 30:52.716
that you want me to perform
on Anna Plaisance.

30:52.752 --> 30:54.218
- I can't.
- I don't understand.

30:54.253 --> 30:55.686
You've had this hand for years.

30:55.721 --> 30:58.022
Why now, all of a sudden,
is it acting up?

30:58.057 --> 31:00.958
Because I'm exhausted from
the pressure of having to do

31:00.993 --> 31:04.695
the most complex operation in
the history of modern medicine!

31:04.730 --> 31:06.730
Now, if you'll just cancel the surgery,

31:06.766 --> 31:09.633
I can get back to spending time
trying to control my hand.

31:09.669 --> 31:12.269
I'm not canceling anything.

31:12.305 --> 31:15.039
See, the way I see it, you
really only have three options.

31:15.074 --> 31:17.374
One, perform the surgery.

31:17.410 --> 31:20.644
Screw it up, and you'll never
be allowed in the O.R. again.

31:20.680 --> 31:22.746
Or you can decide not to do the surgery;

31:22.782 --> 31:24.381
at which point, I will fire you

31:24.417 --> 31:26.383
and share with the world why.

31:26.419 --> 31:28.719
And you will never be
allowed in the O.R. again.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.654
Or you can grow a pair

31:30.690 --> 31:33.791
and be the brilliant surgeon
I am paying you to be,

31:33.826 --> 31:36.994
and show the world that this
hospital lives up to its motto,

31:37.029 --> 31:38.996
"Curing the incurable,"

31:39.031 --> 31:42.566
and become a legend in your own time.

31:42.602 --> 31:45.469
I know why you're doing this.

31:45.505 --> 31:47.571
You're trying to get back at me.

31:47.607 --> 31:49.440
You're jealous because I
picked Chanel over you.

31:49.475 --> 31:51.175
That is absolutely correct.

31:52.478 --> 31:54.778
Because if you were screwing me,

31:54.814 --> 31:57.314
in a way that a woman
like myself requires

31:57.350 --> 32:00.818
in her voracious juicy
dotage, then you wouldn't

32:00.853 --> 32:02.653
find yourself in this predicament.

32:02.688 --> 32:03.954
But you're not,

32:03.990 --> 32:07.024
so I am screwing you.

32:07.059 --> 32:08.459
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

32:08.494 --> 32:10.261
Well, screw this.

32:10.296 --> 32:11.996
I'm the greatest surgeon
that ever lived.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.532
I can do this surgery with one
hand tied behind my back.

32:14.567 --> 32:17.301
In fact...

32:17.336 --> 32:19.203
that's exactly what I'm going to do.

32:19.238 --> 32:20.371
Deal.

32:20.406 --> 32:22.039
Deal.

33:23.279 --> 33:26.647
Why is your chief surgeon
restricting his right hand?

33:27.216 --> 33:29.316
<i>To prove to you how incredible</i>

33:29.351 --> 33:31.118
<i>he and this hospital are,</i>

33:31.153 --> 33:33.120
he is doing this entire surgery

33:33.155 --> 33:34.454
<i>with literally one hand</i>

33:34.490 --> 33:36.156
tied behind his back.

33:36.191 --> 33:37.524
<i>Heck of a story.</i>

33:37.560 --> 33:39.626
All right, let's begin.

33:39.662 --> 33:41.261
Scalpel.

34:28.243 --> 34:30.409
All right, I'm opening the chest

34:30.446 --> 34:32.346
and exposing the mediastinum.

34:34.449 --> 34:37.250
I'm opening the pericardium.

34:38.621 --> 34:41.088
Dissecting the great vessels.

34:43.158 --> 34:45.025
All right, hook up the
cardiopulmonary bypass.

34:50.632 --> 34:51.598
Okay?

34:51.634 --> 34:53.467
Mm-hmm.

35:08.450 --> 35:09.750
Okay, let's go.

35:09.785 --> 35:10.884
That donor heart's gonna be useless

35:10.919 --> 35:12.586
if we don't get blood flow to it soon.

35:16.925 --> 35:18.558
What's the delay in there?

35:18.594 --> 35:21.061
He is pausing for dramatic effect.

35:21.096 --> 35:23.964
Maybe it would be
easier if he, you know,

35:23.999 --> 35:25.799
used both hands.

35:25.834 --> 35:27.934
Maybe it'd be easier if you
shut your damn pie hole!

35:27.970 --> 35:29.803
Come on, Brock, you got this.

35:29.838 --> 35:31.505
I can't. I can't do this.

35:33.342 --> 35:35.976
Get my mask. The hand is out of control.

35:36.011 --> 35:36.910
Have Cassidy finish.

35:36.945 --> 35:38.245
No! This is your moment.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.414
I can't. Too much pressure.

35:40.449 --> 35:42.349
You can do this if you let me help you.

35:42.384 --> 35:44.518
You have to finally open up to me.

35:44.553 --> 35:46.687
You have to tell me
things about your life.

35:46.722 --> 35:48.321
Tell me something that's
always helped you calm down,

35:48.357 --> 35:49.823
like, from when you were a kid.

35:49.858 --> 35:51.224
It's okay, you can

35:51.260 --> 35:52.592
be vulnerable with me.

35:52.628 --> 35:54.628
I'm not gonna judge you, I promise.

35:54.663 --> 35:56.763
We have about three minutes
until that heart tissue dies.

35:56.799 --> 36:00.100
Brock, come on.

36:00.135 --> 36:02.936
Well, there was this song
my au pair sang to me

36:02.971 --> 36:04.371
when I was a kid.

36:04.406 --> 36:06.773
She sang it to me when
she put me to bed,

36:06.809 --> 36:09.209
and it always calmed me
down and helped me sleep.

36:09.244 --> 36:10.210
Okay, what's the song?

36:10.245 --> 36:11.278
The Chanels and I will sing it to you.

36:11.313 --> 36:12.879
"99 Red Balloons."

36:12.915 --> 36:15.282
That song came out in 1983,

36:15.317 --> 36:16.483
which would mean you would

36:16.518 --> 36:17.818
probably be about 20.

36:17.853 --> 36:19.453
Why did you have an au pair?!

36:19.488 --> 36:21.154
Hey, guys, the heart?

37:23.619 --> 37:25.619
Yes!

37:32.394 --> 37:33.260
Great!

37:40.075 --> 37:42.526
It turns out the skin
growths on your face

37:42.551 --> 37:43.650
are what saved your life.

37:43.685 --> 37:46.252
Stem cells in the skin formed new tissue

37:46.288 --> 37:48.655
called harmatomas,
expressing high levels

37:48.690 --> 37:50.790
of dioxin-metabolizing enzymes,

37:50.825 --> 37:54.294
isolating the dioxin away
from your vital organs.

37:54.329 --> 37:55.995
Now, I'm gonna put you
on an anti-obesity drug

37:56.031 --> 37:57.363
called orlistat.

37:57.399 --> 38:00.767
It should help to pull the
dioxin out of your tissues,

38:00.802 --> 38:02.669
and allow you to excrete it harmlessly.

38:02.704 --> 38:04.604
Thanks, Dr. Cascade.

38:04.639 --> 38:06.306
I'm just curious.

38:06.341 --> 38:07.974
What's going to happen with
you and your girlfriend?

38:08.009 --> 38:10.510
Uh, we got in a huge fight. We broke up.

38:10.545 --> 38:12.946
But considering that I
was poisoning myself

38:12.981 --> 38:14.714
to get rid of her, it's
probably for the best.

38:14.749 --> 38:16.316
- Right?
- Yeah.

38:16.351 --> 38:18.551
But, um, I got to be honest.

38:18.587 --> 38:21.821
It was nice that she liked me so much.

38:25.827 --> 38:28.861
Can we talk?

38:28.897 --> 38:33.833
Look, I feel bad about
how we left things.

38:33.868 --> 38:36.869
You mean by saying you were
probably going to kill me?

38:36.905 --> 38:40.406
Yeah. See, I-I got a little upset.

38:40.442 --> 38:44.344
But I want to make it
up to you with a gift.

38:44.379 --> 38:47.580
I promise not to murder you or Chanel.

38:47.616 --> 38:50.583
So if either of you end up dying,

38:50.619 --> 38:52.352
just know it wasn't me.

38:52.387 --> 38:53.886
Wait.

38:53.922 --> 38:56.823
I mean, thanks, but I'm confused.

38:56.858 --> 39:00.326
If you don't kill me
or Chanel, who would?

39:00.362 --> 39:02.595
I can't tell you that.

39:02.631 --> 39:06.866
But I can tell you that
I'm not the only killer.

39:08.937 --> 39:10.169
Wait, what?

39:10.205 --> 39:13.106
Why can't you tell me?

39:13.141 --> 39:15.375
I have my reasons.

39:26.655 --> 39:29.856
I promise to do everything I can...

39:30.959 --> 39:33.626
to make sure that
this all ends up okay.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.535
<i>Arthur, it's Slade. Listen.</i>

39:42.570 --> 39:45.938
Something very weird is going
on at the C.U.R.E. Institute.

39:45.974 --> 39:48.608
I've seen more ethics
violations in the last two days

39:48.643 --> 39:50.576
than I've seen in my entire career.

39:50.612 --> 39:52.211
They've got first-year medical students

39:52.247 --> 39:53.780
acting as attending physicians

39:53.815 --> 39:56.115
and assisting on major surgeries.

39:56.151 --> 40:00.153
And I'm pretty sure I
just saw Hester Ulrich.

40:01.423 --> 40:03.723
Yeah, from the Netflix documentary.

40:03.758 --> 40:05.758
I think she works at the hospital.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.394
The head nurse is
obviously a drug addict,

40:08.430 --> 40:10.897
and Cathy Munsch keeps
insisting she's a doctor.

40:10.932 --> 40:12.432
You have to come down here.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.334
Yeah.

40:14.369 --> 40:17.070
I think we're in the middle of a
major medical ethics scandal.

40:17.105 --> 40:19.772
I have photos and everything.
I'll send them to you as soon...

40:29.050 --> 40:30.917
Good work on that surgery.

40:30.952 --> 40:31.951
Thanks.

40:31.986 --> 40:34.954
Ms. Plaisance is doing great.

40:34.989 --> 40:36.489
I brought you a present.

40:36.524 --> 40:38.925
Thank you. I didn't get you anything.

40:38.960 --> 40:41.194
Aw, no. Okay.

40:44.899 --> 40:48.301
It's one of the hands you
removed from Ms. Plaisance.

40:48.336 --> 40:51.170
From the size and structure of
it and the other extremities,

40:51.206 --> 40:54.273
it appears that her twin was male.

40:54.309 --> 40:57.677
I'd say that hand looks pretty
close in size to yours.

40:59.581 --> 41:01.447
I've been studying your
hand transplant surgery

41:01.483 --> 41:03.783
and practicing all week.

41:03.818 --> 41:06.018
If you would let me, I'd love to try

41:06.054 --> 41:10.490
and replace your killer hand
with this totally innocent one.

41:10.525 --> 41:12.692
You'd do that for me?

41:14.362 --> 41:18.631
You've been sort of a mentor
and big brother to me.

41:18.666 --> 41:22.702
And besides, I'm trying to get
on Chanel #3's good side,

41:22.737 --> 41:24.504
so preventing you from
killing her friend

41:24.539 --> 41:27.006
seems like a pretty winning plan.

41:27.075 --> 41:29.041
Okay.

41:29.077 --> 41:30.810
Let's do this.

42:05.380 --> 42:08.381
