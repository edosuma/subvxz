09:20.255 --> 09:22.300
ALSO MEANS I FINALLY
GOT TO MAKE JACOB'S

09:22.344 --> 09:24.607
"CAN'T SCREW IT UP IF YOU
TRIED" PANCAKE RECIPE.
[JAYMEE GIGGLES]

09:24.651 --> 09:28.089
OH, THAT'S REALLY SWEET,
ASH, BUT I HAVE TO WORK
THE LUNCH SHIFT.

09:28.132 --> 09:30.831
NO, NO, NO. ALMOST DONE.
JUST ONE MINUTE. PROMISE.

09:30.874 --> 09:32.572
- OK.
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

09:32.615 --> 09:34.878
SO, IN ADDITION TO YOU
MAKING PANCAKES,

09:34.922 --> 09:37.838
HOW ARE YOU PLANNING
TO SPEND THIS RARE
SATURDAY OFF?

09:37.881 --> 09:39.666
OH, SOME OF US ARE
GETTING TOGETHER
TO HAVE

09:39.709 --> 09:42.320
A G.A.U. WATCH PARTY
AT SLAUSON CAFEÉ.
JAYMEE: MMM.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.540
I FIGURED IT'D BE
A GOOD CHANCE FOR YOU TO
MEET THE REST OF THE CREW.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.716
ACTUALLY, I LIKE
WATCHING FOOTBALL
IN A STADIUM FULL

09:46.760 --> 09:48.979
OF STRANGERS WITH
AN EMPTY SEAT BESIDE ME.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.896
[GIGGLES]
I'M KIDDING, ASH.
OF COURSE, I'D LOVE TO.

09:52.940 --> 09:55.246
FINALLY GET THE SCOOP
ON HIGH-SCHOOL ASHER.

09:55.290 --> 09:59.076
FINALLY? ALL THE GUYS DO
IS TELL EMBARRASSING
STORIES ABOUT ME.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.645
OH, DUDE GOSSIP ALWAYS
ENDS WITH SOMEONE MAKING
AN ASS OF THEMSELF,

10:02.689 --> 10:06.910
BUT IF I WANT TO FIND OUT
THE REAL ON IF YOUNG ASHER
WAS A LITTLE PLAYER,

10:06.954 --> 10:09.434
I GOT TO TALK TO THE LADIES
THAT YOU KNOW BEST.

10:09.478 --> 10:10.914
- PLAYER? HEH HEH!
- MM-HMM.

10:10.958 --> 10:13.351
NO, NO,
IT WASN'T, LIKE...

10:13.395 --> 10:15.745
WHY WOULD YOU
THINK THAT? WHY WOULD
YOU THINK THAT I WAS--

10:15.789 --> 10:17.921
- ARE YOU A LITTLE WORRIED?
- HEH!

10:19.706 --> 10:22.143
UM, IT'S
A LITTLE SALTY.

10:22.186 --> 10:25.363
THERE'S SALT
IN THE RECIPE.
LOOK, THE T's OF SALT.

10:25.407 --> 10:27.844
HEH! THE T's...

10:27.888 --> 10:30.673
WELL, HERE, I'M GONNA
BE LATE, BUT--HEH!

10:30.717 --> 10:32.675
- AHEM.
- YEAH, I'LL EXPLAIN
THE DIFFERENCE

10:32.719 --> 10:36.505
BETWEEN BIG T's
AND LITTLE T's WHEN YOU
PICK ME UP TOMORROW, OK?

10:36.548 --> 10:38.507
[KISS]
BYE.

10:38.550 --> 10:40.248
BYE.

10:40.291 --> 10:43.207
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE T's?

10:44.426 --> 10:47.124
OLIVIA: I MEAN,
SHE DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO HEAR OUT THE PITCH.

10:47.168 --> 10:49.126
SHE JUST TOLD ME
TO DROP IT.

10:49.170 --> 10:52.347
- DROP WHAT?
- ANYTHING THAT HAS
TO DO WITH N.I.L.

10:52.390 --> 10:55.132
SHE TOLD ME I NEED
TO LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE
FOR MY FIRST BYLINE.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.482
I'M SORRY, BABY.
I KNOW YOU REALLY
BELIEVED IN THE STORY.

10:57.526 --> 10:59.136
SOMETHING ELSE
GONNA COME UP.

10:59.180 --> 11:01.356
OH, NO, I'M NOT
DROPPING THIS ONE.
I JUST NEED

11:01.399 --> 11:03.445
TO FIND A TOTALLY
DIFFERENT TAKE
ON THE STORY.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.186
BUT I THOUGHT YOUR BOSS
SAID TO DROP ANYTHING

11:05.229 --> 11:06.883
TO DO WITH N.I.L.
OLIVIA: YEAH, BUT SHE ALSO

11:06.927 --> 11:08.711
MENTIONED THE STORY
NEEDING A FACE,

11:08.755 --> 11:10.713
THE INHERENT INEQUITY
OF THE SYSTEM

11:10.757 --> 11:12.715
AT A HUMAN LEVEL,

11:12.759 --> 11:14.238
A STORY LIKE YOURS.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.284
- LIKE MINE?
- YEAH. I MEAN,

11:16.327 --> 11:18.982
ALL THE N.I.L. PRESS IS
ABOUT MASSIVE PAYDAYS

11:19.026 --> 11:21.506
TO A TINY HANDFUL
OF TOP PLAYERS.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.726
NO ONE'S TOLD THE STORY
OF THE VAST MAJORITY

11:23.770 --> 11:25.249
OF PLAYERS THAT BARELY
GET ANYTHING.

11:25.293 --> 11:27.730
WAIT, AND YOU WANT ME
TO BE THE FACE OF THAT?

11:27.774 --> 11:29.863
LIV, I AM ACTIVELY
SEEKING ENDORSEMENTS.

11:29.906 --> 11:31.908
YOU WANT ME TO BE A PART
OF AN N.I.L. HIT PIECE?

11:31.952 --> 11:34.737
IT'S JUST AN IDEA...

11:34.781 --> 11:36.696
AND I'M GUESSING
IT'S A NO?

11:36.739 --> 11:39.786
- YEAH.
- [SIGHS]
OK, FORGET I MENTIONED IT.

11:39.829 --> 11:41.613
WHY ARE YOU SO DETERMINED
TO WRITE THIS STORY?

11:41.657 --> 11:43.790
'CAUSE IT'S STARTING
TO FEEL PERSONAL.
OLIVIA: IT'S NOT.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.792
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW YOU
HAD AN ISSUE WITH N.I.L.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.838
UNTIL I SAW YOU ARGUING
WITH DAVITA ABOUT IT AT
MY FIRST ENDORSEMENT EVENT.

11:48.882 --> 11:51.711
YOU THINK
THIS IS ABOUT YOU?

11:51.754 --> 11:53.625
- IS IT?
- NO! IT--IT'S

11:53.669 --> 11:57.412
A SEISMIC SHIFT
IN COLLEGE SPORTS THAT
EVERYONE'S CELEBRATING

11:57.455 --> 12:01.111
LIKE IT'S SOME
GREAT LEAP FORWARD, BUT
THE REALITY IS--IS THAT

12:01.155 --> 12:04.114
MOST PLAYERS ARE LUCKY
ENOUGH TO GET, LIKE,
A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS.

12:04.158 --> 12:06.769
SO WHY NOT LET US MAKE
A FEW HUNDRED BUCKS?
TO PEOPLE LIKE ME,

12:06.813 --> 12:09.554
THAT'S REAL MONEY, NOT
SOMETHING YOU JUST SHRUG
OFF LIKE IT'S NOTHING.

12:09.598 --> 12:12.819
- AND YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT?
- YOU DIDN'T LIVE IT.

12:15.604 --> 12:18.302
I DIDN'T MEAN IT
THAT WAY.

12:18.346 --> 12:20.304
YEAH, YOU DID,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.306
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:22.350 --> 12:23.786
I'M PRIVILEGED.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.788
I GREW UP IN
BEVERLY HILLS, OK?

12:25.832 --> 12:27.747
I DON'T DENY THAT,

12:27.790 --> 12:29.749
BUT IF YOU SEEM
TO THINK THAT THAT
INVALIDATES MY POINT

12:29.792 --> 12:33.622
OF VIEW, THEN...
I GUESS THERE'S
NO POINT IN ARGUING.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.537
LIV. LIV, COME ON--

12:35.580 --> 12:37.757
[SIGHS]

12:47.114 --> 12:49.072
EVERYTHING OK,
MS. MARITTA?

12:49.116 --> 12:52.162
SOMEONE STOLE
MY EMERALD EARRINGS
FROM MY ROOM,

12:52.206 --> 12:54.382
AND I JUST KNOW IT'S
ONE OF THE RESIDENTS.

12:54.425 --> 12:56.732
YOU KNOW,
SHERYL GOT CAUGHT
JUST THIS WEEK.

12:56.776 --> 12:59.909
OH, SHE WAS JUST BEING NOSY.
YOU SURE YOU AIN'T FORGET
WHERE YOU PUT 'EM?

12:59.953 --> 13:01.911
[SIGHS]
I DON'T EVEN
WEAR 'EM NO MORE.

13:01.955 --> 13:05.088
THEY'RE SO HEAVY,
HURTS MY EARS.

13:05.132 --> 13:08.352
OK, WELL, WHEN'S
THE LAST TIME
YOU SEEN 'EM?

13:08.396 --> 13:10.746
NIGHT BEFORE LAST.

13:10.790 --> 13:14.532
UM, MS. MARITTA,
I--I DID SEE SOMEONE

13:14.576 --> 13:17.709
UH, IN YOUR ROOM,
AND I THOUGHT IT
WAS SUSPICIOUS.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.842
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SAY ANYTHING?

13:19.886 --> 13:22.802
WELL, BECAUSE IT WAS
YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER.

13:22.845 --> 13:24.760
- SKYE?
- YEAH, I CAME IN,

13:24.804 --> 13:27.850
AND SHE WAS GOING
THROUGH YOUR CLOSET
WHILE YOU WERE ASLEEP.

13:27.894 --> 13:31.767
SKYE...DIDN'T STEAL
MY EARRINGS.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.856
- I'M ONLY TELLING YOU
WHAT I SAW.
- NO.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.380
YOU'RE ACCUSING
MY FAVORITE GRANDDAUGHTER

13:36.424 --> 13:38.556
OF STEALING FROM ME.
COOP: I'M SORRY, OK?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.558
I'M NOT TRYING
TO MAKE YOU UPSET;
I'M JUST TRYING

13:40.602 --> 13:42.952
TO HELP YOU FIND
YOUR EARRINGS,
THAT'S ALL.

13:42.996 --> 13:45.912
THINK I'VE HAD ENOUGH
OF YOUR HELP.

- [EXHALES] YO?
- WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

13:58.359 --> 14:00.187
GARRETT: WHAT? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
SPENCER: I DON'T KNOW.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.798
I ALWAYS TRY TO AVOID
THAT LOOK WHEN I CAN.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.105

OVER HERE. CRAP. UM...

14:05.148 --> 14:09.196
[CLEARS THROAT]
GARRETT: 1, YOU HEARD
FROM MY QB1 TODAY?

14:09.239 --> 14:13.069
JORDAN: WADE? UH, NOT
SINCE OUR QB MEETING AFTER
PRACTICE YESTERDAY, SIR.

14:13.113 --> 14:14.679
SO YOU HEARD HE WAS
GONNA BE LATE TO PRACTICE?

14:14.723 --> 14:17.160
BRYANT: UH, HEY,
AND THAT PROFESSOR'S
OFFICE HOURS,

14:17.204 --> 14:19.075
THEY'RE CRAZY.
JORDAN: YEAH, COACH, UM...

14:19.119 --> 14:21.904
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REMEMBER WHAT IT
WAS FOR, BUT HE DID

14:21.948 --> 14:24.167
MENTION HE WAS
WORRIED ABOUT
BEING LATE, SIR.

14:24.211 --> 14:28.389
KENNY: FIRST TEAM NEEDS
A QB, COACH, UNLESS WE'RE
GONNA WAIT ON WADE.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.826
12, YOU STEP IN
UNTIL WADE SHOWS.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.960
1, YOU'RE WITH SECOND TEAM.
QUICK FEET, QUICK READS,

14:34.003 --> 14:36.353
AND IF THE WIDEOUTS
START SLACKING,
YOU FIRE THAT BALL

14:36.397 --> 14:38.355
LIKE A DAMN ROCKET
AND MAKE 'EM RESPECT YOU.

14:38.399 --> 14:41.315
UNDERSTOOD?
JORDAN: YES, SIR.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.712
JORDAN:
I KILLED IT, OK?

14:47.756 --> 14:50.541

YO, I CAN'T WAIT TO
TELL YOU ALL ABOUT IT.

14:50.585 --> 14:53.022
[SIGHS]
I HATE THAT WE KEEP

14:53.066 --> 14:55.024
MISSING EACH OTHER, THOUGH.
IT'S, UH, IT'S--

14:55.068 --> 14:58.549
OH, MY GOD.
SIMONE, I HAVEN'T EVEN
TOLD YOU ABOUT VEGAS.

14:58.593 --> 15:01.726
YO, WADE IS TAKING ME
ON A PRIVATE JET.
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

15:01.770 --> 15:05.252
I'LL--I'LL TELL YOU LATER.
UM, I LOVE YOU, BABE.

15:08.559 --> 15:10.735
ALREADY, PRIVATE JETS
TO VEGAS? SHEESH!

- CHECK OUT THESE PICS
OF THE JET, BRO--
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

15:12.781 --> 15:14.348
SHOW ME LATER.
I GOTTA MEET UP
WITH JAYMEE.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.915
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH.
- COOL.

15:15.958 --> 15:17.438
WHAT'S UP, SPENCE?

15:17.481 --> 15:19.570
- HEY, WHAT UP, ASH?
- WOW, CAN YOU BELIEVE

15:19.614 --> 15:22.399
THAT JORDAN'S GONNA
BE PARTYING WITH
WADE WATERS IN VEGAS?

15:22.443 --> 15:24.749

IT'S PRETTY CRAZY.

INSANE. HEH HEH!

15:26.360 --> 15:29.319
PEACE, GUYS.
SPENCER: ALL RIGHT, BOY.

15:29.363 --> 15:31.408
IS THERE
A PROBLEM, SPENCE?

15:31.452 --> 15:34.063
[BAG THUDS]
SPENCER: HOW ABOUT
YOU LYING FOR WADE?

15:34.107 --> 15:36.936
COME ON, DUDE. I MEAN,
IT WASN'T EXACTLY A LIE.

15:36.979 --> 15:39.242
I HEARD WADE TELL YOU
HE MIGHT BE LATE
FOR PRACTICE

15:39.286 --> 15:41.766
'CAUSE OF THE
AUREATE CHARTER MEETING,
AND THEN YOU WENT

15:41.810 --> 15:44.291
AND BACKED UP
SOME HALF-ASSED "MEETING
THE PROFESSOR" EXCUSE.

15:44.334 --> 15:47.250
OK, AND I WOULD DO
THE SAME THING FOR YOU BECAUSE
I DON'T RAT OUT MY FRIENDS.

15:47.294 --> 15:50.601
YOU THINK HE'S YOUR FRIEND
'CAUSE HE'S LETTING YOU
RIDE HIS N.I.L. COATTAILS?

15:50.645 --> 15:54.083
WADE AIN'T PILING UP DEALS
FOR NOBODY BUT WADE.

15:54.127 --> 15:58.087
AND WHO ARE YOU TRYING
TO SIGN N.I.L. DEALS FOR
IF NOT YOURSELF, HMM?

15:58.131 --> 15:59.784
LITTLE HYPOCRITICAL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

15:59.828 --> 16:02.004
- I'M NOT BLOWING OFF PRACTICE.
- AND YOU'RE NOT

16:02.048 --> 16:03.875
A HEISMAN CANDIDATE,
EITHER. LOOK, THE TEAM

16:03.919 --> 16:06.617
IS LUCKY
TO HAVE WADE, SPENCE.
HE IS AN ELITE TALENT.

16:06.661 --> 16:09.577
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HIM
AS IF HE'S THE ONLY ONE
TO EVER QB A DAMN GAME.

16:09.620 --> 16:11.361
YOU'VE DONE THE STUFF
HE'S DONE.

16:11.405 --> 16:13.233
- AT THE HIGH-SCHOOL LEVEL!
- ALL I'M SAYING IS

16:13.276 --> 16:15.757
IT'S THE SAME GAME.
THE FIELD IS STILL

16:15.800 --> 16:17.759
A HUNDRED YARDS LONG,
WITH AN END ZONE

16:17.802 --> 16:20.936
AT EITHER END,
AND WADE IS
A SELFISH ASS

16:20.980 --> 16:23.460
WHETHER HE'S ON IT
OR OFF CHASING
HIS ENDORSEMENTS!

16:23.504 --> 16:25.462
OH, MY GOD, BRO.
IT WAS ONE PRACTICE.

16:25.506 --> 16:27.638
HE'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A LEADER!

16:27.682 --> 16:30.206
WHEN WADE
BLOWS OFF PRACTICE,
IT HURTS THE TEAM,

16:30.250 --> 16:32.165
OUR TEAM.

16:33.905 --> 16:37.997
IT'S GONNA TAKE MORE
THAN A PLANE RIDE TO
BLIND ME TO THAT TRUTH.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.662
IF ANYTHING, I WISH
I HAD HAVE SIGNED

16:51.706 --> 16:54.100
SOME--SOME N.I.L.
DEALS WHEN I PLAYED.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.537
YEAH. WHY DOES THAT
SURPRISE YOU?

16:56.580 --> 16:59.540
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT
HOW NCAA ATHLETES

16:59.583 --> 17:02.064
HAVE TOO MUCH
ON THEIR PLATE,
TOO MANY DISTRACTIONS.

17:02.108 --> 17:06.242
- AND I STILL BELIEVE THAT.
- WELL, ISN'T N.I.L. JUST
ANOTHER DISTRACTION?

17:06.286 --> 17:08.244
LOOK, DO I WISH THAT
COLLEGE PLAYERS WOULD

17:08.288 --> 17:10.681
FOCUS ON SCHOOL
AND FOOTBALL?

17:10.725 --> 17:13.336
YES, BUT THE TRUTH
OF THE MATTER IS

17:13.380 --> 17:16.078
THE CASH IS THERE AND
IT IS A DISTRACTION.

17:16.122 --> 17:18.602
I MEAN, I KNOW CASH
AND FAVORS HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN CHANGING HANDS,

17:18.646 --> 17:22.737
BUT, I MEAN, WOULDN'T
MORE MONEY EQUAL
MORE DISTRACTIONS?

17:22.780 --> 17:25.740
THE CATS
THAT I KNEW WHO TOOK
THE LUNCH MONEY--

17:25.783 --> 17:28.090
OH, WE CALLED IT
"LUNCH MONEY" BECAUSE
THE MONEY WOULD COME

17:28.134 --> 17:30.745
IN, LIKE, BROWN PAPER BAGS.
OLIVIA: SO IT WASN'T
EXACTLY A SECRET?

17:30.788 --> 17:33.443
NO, NO, NO,
NOT THE PLAYERS,
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S NOT

17:33.487 --> 17:35.402
LIKE THESE CATS WERE
PUSHING GOLD CAMAROS

17:35.445 --> 17:38.187
OR GETTING STACKS
OF CASH; THEY
JUST WANTED TO

17:38.231 --> 17:40.537
TAKE THEIR GIRL OUT
FOR A NICE DINNER
OR, YOU KNOW,

17:40.581 --> 17:42.191
EAT SOMEWHERE OTHER
THAN THE COMMISSARY.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.193
SO THE TOP PLAYERS
RAKE IN ALL THE CASH,

17:44.237 --> 17:47.022
AND EVERYBODY ELSE
GETS A FEW BUCKS.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.764
IT SOUNDS LIKE
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED.

17:49.807 --> 17:54.203
ALL RIGHT,
SO I KNEW THIS CAT,
WALLY. WALLY DIX.

17:54.247 --> 17:56.205
HE ACCEPTED
A PLANE TICKET
SO HE COULD GO HOME

17:56.249 --> 17:58.903
FOR A FUNERAL;
NCAA FOUND OUT,

17:58.947 --> 18:00.818
AND THEY MADE HIM
INELIGIBLE.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.733
INELIGIBLE.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.127
THAT WASN'T JUSTICE.
THAT WAS A WASTED FUTURE.

18:05.171 --> 18:08.739
- I GUESS I NEVER
THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.
- YEAH.

18:08.783 --> 18:11.133
WE GOOD?

18:11.177 --> 18:13.135
YEAH. JUST THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING

18:13.179 --> 18:15.920
SPENCER SAID
ABOUT THE STORY, OR...

18:15.964 --> 18:20.534
LACK OF STORY,
I SHOULD SAY.
I SHOULD HEAD OUT.

18:20.577 --> 18:23.276
OK. YOU DON'T WANT
TO STAY AND WATCH

LOOK, I APPRECIATE IT,

WADE GOT BENCHED,

39:43.816 --> 39:46.471
I'D HAVE BET
A MILLION DOLLARS I'D
NEVER SEE THAT FIELD.

39:46.514 --> 39:48.690
WAIT. BENCHED? ANNOUNCERS
THOUGHT IT WAS, LIKE,
A INJURY OR SOMETHING.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.692

AN N.I.L. STORY.

- ONE YOU HAVEN'T READ BEFORE.
- YOU GOT A FACE TO GO
WITH THE HEADLINE?
