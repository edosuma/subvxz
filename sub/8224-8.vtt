00:00.401 --> 00:04.104
On this episode of "MythBusters"...

00:04.105 --> 00:05.372
Okay. Fire at will.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.441
...Adam and Jamie stare down the barrel

00:07.442 --> 00:10.043
for a death-defying bullet dodge.

00:10.044 --> 00:10.744
Damn.

00:10.745 --> 00:12.212
We want to see

00:12.213 --> 00:14.014
how close a sniper could be

00:14.015 --> 00:16.717
and you would still be
able to dodge his bullet.

00:16.718 --> 00:19.419
Provided you can see the muzzle flash...

00:19.420 --> 00:20.420
Oh, I saw that.

00:20.421 --> 00:21.655
I totally saw that.

00:21.656 --> 00:24.357
...can you ever dive to survive?

00:24.358 --> 00:25.959
Jamie might be able to dodge a bullet,

00:25.960 --> 00:27.027
but can he dance like this?

00:27.028 --> 00:29.563
Oh, yeah!

00:29.564 --> 00:32.432
Then Buster is used and abused...

00:32.433 --> 00:35.268
- Anybody feel sorry for Buster?
- No. - No.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.970
...as Kari, Grant, and Tory

00:36.971 --> 00:39.706
investigate the vertigo-inducing myth...

00:39.707 --> 00:41.608
Belly flop!

00:41.609 --> 00:44.711
...that if you fall from a great height...

00:44.712 --> 00:47.781
Dropping Buster on his face
repeatedly doesn't get old.

00:47.782 --> 00:50.984
...water has the same impact as pavement.

00:50.985 --> 00:53.120
<i>Adiรณs, muchacho.</i>

00:57.125 --> 00:58.825
Who are the MythBusters?

00:59.761 --> 01:00.761
Adam Savage...

01:00.762 --> 01:01.795
Ah-choo!

01:01.796 --> 01:02.863
I'm done with science for today.

01:02.864 --> 01:04.831
...and Jamie Hyneman.

01:04.831 --> 01:06.266
Bye-bye.

01:06.267 --> 01:10.904
Between them, more than 30 years
of special-effects experience.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.974
Joining them... Grant Imahara...

01:13.975 --> 01:15.542
It's why we can never have anything nice.

01:15.543 --> 01:16.943
...Tory Belleci...

01:16.944 --> 01:18.678
I'll try not to let you guys down.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.213
- ...and Kari Byron.
- Whoa!

01:20.214 --> 01:22.215
You know, I went to college for this.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.184
They don't just tell the myths.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.286
They put them to the test.

01:26.311 --> 01:29.811
MythBusters 9x08 - Dodge a Bullet
Original air date June 1, 2011

01:29.836 --> 01:33.836
Sync and corrected by atrn97g
www.addic7ed.com

01:34.869 --> 01:36.303
All right.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.971
This week, as voted by the fans,

01:37.972 --> 01:40.874
we are tackling the myth that
it is possible to dodge a bullet.

01:40.875 --> 01:42.910
What do you mean? You can't
move faster than a bullet.

01:42.911 --> 01:45.679
Ah, it is not about moving
<i>faster</i> than a bullet.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.381
The theory behind this myth is the idea

01:47.382 --> 01:49.383
that there is a theoretical distance

01:49.384 --> 01:51.952
at which you could both
see a bullet being fired

01:51.953 --> 01:54.154
and yet have enough time
to get out of the way

01:54.155 --> 01:56.023
of the bullet that's been fired at you

01:56.024 --> 01:57.791
before it gets to you and hits you.

01:57.792 --> 02:00.160
Well, the shooter would have to be

02:00.161 --> 02:02.362
some distance away, like, say, a sniper.

02:02.363 --> 02:03.363
Exactly.

02:04.966 --> 02:08.335
It's no myth that dodging
a bullet at close range

02:08.336 --> 02:10.204
is never gonna happen.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.039
Agh!

02:12.040 --> 02:16.310
But when you increase the
distance from shooter to target,

02:16.311 --> 02:18.278
you increase the travel
time for the bullet.

02:19.414 --> 02:23.016
So, assuming a sniper is far enough away

02:23.017 --> 02:28.222
and you see him take the shot,
can you really dive to survive?

02:28.223 --> 02:31.925
Here's what I'm thinking.
This story is all about time.

02:31.926 --> 02:33.060
Yeah.

02:33.061 --> 02:35.062
So, the first thing I think
we want to determine

02:35.063 --> 02:36.897
is how much time a bullet spends in the air

02:36.898 --> 02:38.332
between the rifle and the target

02:38.333 --> 02:40.734
from a bunch of different distances.

02:40.735 --> 02:42.603
Makes sense to me. Let's get shootin'.

02:42.604 --> 02:43.637
All right.

02:43.638 --> 02:46.240
And to find out just that,

02:46.241 --> 02:49.376
Adam and Jamie need a supersized gun range,

02:49.377 --> 02:52.746
like this handy abandoned airfield.

02:52.747 --> 02:55.048
It's true that in the course
of doing "MythBusters",

02:55.049 --> 02:57.184
Jamie and I have done
our fair bit of shooting,

02:57.185 --> 02:58.285
and we're not bad shots.

02:59.220 --> 03:00.320
Oh, Jamie!

03:00.321 --> 03:01.989
Now we're talkin'.

03:01.990 --> 03:05.192
But for this story, we need
real precision, real expertise,

03:05.193 --> 03:06.727
and that's why we brought in

03:06.728 --> 03:09.129
one of the finest marksmen in the country.

03:09.130 --> 03:11.331
Don't believe me? Check this out.

03:11.332 --> 03:15.202
In a modern interpretation of William Tell,

03:15.203 --> 03:20.374
the tiny, tasty target is 300 yards away.

03:22.000 --> 03:28.074

03:31.452 --> 03:33.387
That's how it's done.

03:33.388 --> 03:35.956
How do you like <i>them</i> apples?

03:35.957 --> 03:39.726
Them apples and this shooter are just fine.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.865
Dave Liwanag has been a
U.S. Army sniper for 31 years.

03:44.866 --> 03:47.534
He was commander of the army shooting team.

03:47.535 --> 03:51.571
He's one of the president's
top 100 distinguished riflemen.

03:51.572 --> 03:53.840
It doesn't get any better than that.

03:53.841 --> 03:56.576
He's shooting a .338 sniper rifle.

03:56.577 --> 03:58.745
This is specifically designed

03:58.746 --> 04:01.682
for accuracy at extreme distance.

04:01.683 --> 04:03.951
And speaking of distance,

04:03.952 --> 04:06.887
200, 500, and 1,200 yards

04:06.888 --> 04:10.657
are the marks from which
the marksman will shoot.

04:10.658 --> 04:14.428
Purpose of this test is to shoot
the rifle at a fixed distance

04:14.429 --> 04:16.262
and record how much time it takes

04:16.264 --> 04:18.130
for the bullet to hit the target.

04:18.132 --> 04:21.101
That's the amount of time that
we'll have to dodge a bullet.

04:21.101 --> 04:25.005
And to accurately measure
the muzzle-to-target time,

04:25.006 --> 04:28.575
Adam and Jamie set up
a foil-based electronic circuit.

04:28.576 --> 04:30.010
Good.

04:30.011 --> 04:32.579
Here's how we're going to time
the bullet's time of flight.

04:32.580 --> 04:34.348
The instant the bullet leaves the gun,

04:34.349 --> 04:36.383
it will cross through this piece of paper

04:36.384 --> 04:38.385
with a piece of foil on each side.

04:38.386 --> 04:40.587
When it breaks that piece of
paper, the foil will connect,

04:40.588 --> 04:42.155
creating an electronic switch connection,

04:42.156 --> 04:45.826
which will send a signal through
this wire to this here timer

04:45.827 --> 04:47.294
and tell it to start timing.

04:47.295 --> 04:48.762
That timer will keep timing

04:48.763 --> 04:51.465
the whole time the bullet
flies through the air...

04:55.837 --> 04:58.438
...right up until our
bullet hits the target,

04:58.439 --> 05:00.707
crossing through the same
type of piece of paper

05:00.708 --> 05:03.143
with foil on both sides,
closing a switch connection,

05:03.144 --> 05:04.811
telling our timer to stop timing,

05:04.812 --> 05:07.114
and giving us an exact
time of flight of the bullet

05:07.115 --> 05:08.548
from the rifle to the target.

05:08.549 --> 05:11.818
The first distance we'll be
sending a bullet to our target

05:11.819 --> 05:14.588
is 200 yards... 600 feet,

05:14.589 --> 05:18.291
two entire football fields end to end,

05:18.292 --> 05:19.526
six M5's.

05:19.527 --> 05:23.330
So, with Dead-Eye Dave in position...

05:23.331 --> 05:25.465
All right. Time of flight... 200 yards.

05:25.466 --> 05:28.268
...his spotter, Kevin, all lined up...

05:28.269 --> 05:30.470
Bias right ever so slightly.

05:30.471 --> 05:32.472
...and the trusty foil timing system

05:32.473 --> 05:34.975
ready to record the flight
time of each round...

05:34.976 --> 05:37.144
Go right edge, Dave.

05:37.145 --> 05:38.478
Right edge.

05:38.479 --> 05:40.781
...this test is gonna be a breeze.

05:40.782 --> 05:41.948
Send it.

05:45.286 --> 05:46.920
- What?
- Nothing.

05:46.921 --> 05:49.823
It started timing. It didn't stop timing.

05:49.824 --> 05:53.527
Maybe not. The trusty
timing foil is failing.

05:53.528 --> 05:55.929
Basically, we've got an infarction

05:55.930 --> 05:57.998
somewhere in the circuit.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.499
The timing's just not working.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.202
We can't tell if it's at the gun
or it's at the target,

06:02.203 --> 06:04.838
but in order to get timings,
we have to suss this out.

06:08.509 --> 06:11.545
Next up, is the physics
of a fall onto water

06:11.546 --> 06:14.347
really the same as pavement?

06:14.348 --> 06:16.149
Okay, so, we've got a good one.

06:16.150 --> 06:17.918
In this episode, we're testing

06:17.919 --> 06:19.853
that water is as hard as pavement.

06:19.854 --> 06:21.421
Yeah, I've heard this one.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.557
The idea is that if you fall
from a height tall enough

06:23.558 --> 06:24.925
and you get up enough speed,

06:24.926 --> 06:27.661
when you hit that water,
it behaves just like pavement.

06:27.662 --> 06:29.930
Wake up Buster. He's
got some fallin' to do.

06:31.499 --> 06:34.134
It's an oft-repeated urban myth

06:34.135 --> 06:36.503
that if you fall into water
from a great height,

06:36.504 --> 06:37.904
rather than a splash landing,

06:37.905 --> 06:41.741
you have a pavement-equaling crash landing.

06:41.742 --> 06:42.742
Okay.

06:42.743 --> 06:44.211
So, I think we need to get Buster,

06:44.212 --> 06:45.579
rig him with some accelerometers

06:45.580 --> 06:47.914
so we know how much impact he experiences,

06:47.915 --> 06:49.683
and then drop him on pavement

06:49.684 --> 06:52.219
and drop him on water
and compare the results.

06:52.220 --> 06:53.620
Sounds good to me.

06:53.621 --> 06:54.788
But bad for Buster.

06:54.789 --> 06:55.789
Real bad.

06:58.726 --> 07:01.194
This myth is about water
behaving like pavement.

07:01.195 --> 07:03.463
Now, you may be thinking that that's crazy.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.765
I mean, water is soft,
and pavement is hard.

07:05.766 --> 07:07.200
How can they be the same?

07:07.201 --> 07:10.170
Well, under certain
conditions, they can be.

07:10.171 --> 07:11.538
Let me demonstrate.

07:11.539 --> 07:13.073
In this syringe, I have air.

07:13.074 --> 07:16.109
In this syringe, I have water
with some food coloring in it.

07:16.110 --> 07:17.811
Air is compressible.

07:19.180 --> 07:20.280
Compresses.

07:20.281 --> 07:22.449
Springs back.

07:23.684 --> 07:25.385
Water is incompressible.

07:25.386 --> 07:27.587
I try and push it in...

07:29.390 --> 07:30.590
...and it doesn't compress.

07:30.591 --> 07:31.925
And that's what's gonna happen

07:31.926 --> 07:33.593
when your body falls out of the sky

07:33.594 --> 07:35.228
and hits the surface of the water.

07:35.229 --> 07:37.898
It doesn't give, just like pavement.

07:37.899 --> 07:39.432
So, to find out whether or not

07:39.433 --> 07:41.334
water is, in fact, as hard as pavement,

07:41.335 --> 07:43.770
we are gonna be dropping
Buster from heights

07:43.771 --> 07:45.138
wearing one of these.

07:45.139 --> 07:46.339
This is an accelerometer.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.041
It is an electromechanical device

07:48.042 --> 07:50.977
used to measure acceleration forces.

07:50.978 --> 07:52.546
Now, these forces are commonly known

07:52.547 --> 07:55.949
as gravitational forces, or "G" forces.

07:55.950 --> 07:58.185
Now, the challenge with
our specific experiment

07:58.186 --> 08:00.487
Is that we're gonna be
measuring very high "G" loads,

08:00.488 --> 08:02.722
much higher than ordinary
accelerometers can handle.

08:02.723 --> 08:05.425
That's why we have this system.

08:05.426 --> 08:07.227
I'm not fondling his nipple.

08:07.228 --> 08:10.397
It's specifically designed
to measure up to 500 G's.

08:10.398 --> 08:13.066
I've mounted it inside of a waterproof case

08:13.067 --> 08:14.234
in Buster's chest.

08:14.235 --> 08:16.970
Just like airplanes have black boxes,

08:16.971 --> 08:19.806
Buster has a black box, and this is it.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.343
All rigged up and ready to roll,

08:23.344 --> 08:25.445
the team hits the perfect location

08:25.446 --> 08:26.980
for a spot of Buster-bouncing.

08:26.981 --> 08:28.615
Here we are

08:28.616 --> 08:31.251
at the South San Francisco
Water Treatment Center,

08:31.252 --> 08:34.587
and this is the perfect location
for us to test this myth.

08:34.589 --> 08:37.190
It's always exciting when
the crane shows up.

08:37.191 --> 08:39.626
We have pavement, and we have water.

08:39.626 --> 08:42.796
Once we get our crane set,
we won't even have to move it.

08:42.797 --> 08:44.531
Bull's-eye.

08:44.532 --> 08:47.801
You know, Buster has been
very, very quiet today.

08:47.802 --> 08:50.604
I have a feeling he might
know what we're up to.

08:50.605 --> 08:51.838
In the team's sight

08:51.839 --> 08:55.442
is a series of consistent
comparative drop tests

08:55.443 --> 09:00.614
onto water and pavement
at ever-increasing heights.

09:00.615 --> 09:01.681
Good!

09:01.682 --> 09:03.116
Okay.

09:03.117 --> 09:06.353
So, the way Buster falls and
lands will affect the results,

09:06.354 --> 09:07.821
so we've rigged a system

09:07.822 --> 09:10.957
so that he should fall the
same way every single time.

09:10.958 --> 09:13.026
All right! 25 feet! That's good!

09:13.027 --> 09:16.463
And first up is the feet-first fall.

09:16.464 --> 09:17.697
How's that for alliteration?

09:17.698 --> 09:20.200
It was perfectly poetic, Byron.

09:20.201 --> 09:23.169
But Buster, suspended
25 feet above the pavement,

09:23.170 --> 09:25.305
doesn't really care.

09:25.306 --> 09:28.808
In 3, 2, 1...

09:29.810 --> 09:30.910
Ow!

09:30.911 --> 09:32.512
With a long day ahead,

09:32.513 --> 09:34.347
the dummy took that one in his stride.

09:34.348 --> 09:36.416
But what do the numbers tell us?

09:36.417 --> 09:38.852
Get a peak "G" load of 60 G's.

09:38.853 --> 09:41.187
Well, that seems about right.

09:41.188 --> 09:43.890
I mean, he has his legs to break his fall.

09:43.891 --> 09:47.127
So, we just dropped Buster from 25 feet

09:47.128 --> 09:50.797
onto the pavement, feet first,
and he pulled 60 G's.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.533
Now what we're gonna do is
hook him back up to the crane,

09:53.534 --> 09:55.001
swing him over to the water,

09:55.002 --> 09:58.438
drop him again from 25 feet, feet first,

09:58.439 --> 09:59.739
and see how many G's he pulls.

09:59.740 --> 10:01.574
All right. That looks good.

10:01.575 --> 10:04.678
Now, I know water is
technically incompressible,

10:04.679 --> 10:06.913
but compared to the pavement,

10:06.914 --> 10:08.481
I think we're gonna see a lower "G" load

10:08.482 --> 10:09.916
because his feet are gonna dip in,

10:09.917 --> 10:11.318
the water's gonna give,

10:11.319 --> 10:14.621
and he's gonna be decelerated
over a longer time period.

10:14.622 --> 10:18.992
In 3, 2, 1...

10:18.993 --> 10:20.560
Oh, that didn't look so bad.

10:20.561 --> 10:22.796
That's definitely not the same as pavement.

10:22.797 --> 10:25.231
And the numbers bear that out.

10:25.232 --> 10:27.167
Okay, so, I got no trigger,

10:27.168 --> 10:30.236
which means that that
fall was less than 25 G's.

10:30.237 --> 10:31.638
It won't trigger anything below that.

10:31.639 --> 10:34.341
And, remember, in this same situation,

10:34.342 --> 10:36.910
over pavement, it was 60 G's.

10:36.911 --> 10:38.878
But the myth states

10:38.879 --> 10:41.815
that water equals pavement
from a great height,

10:41.816 --> 10:43.383
and at greater heights,

10:43.384 --> 10:46.386
Buster will be falling at greater speeds.

10:46.387 --> 10:50.123
Perhaps hitting the water faster
means the liquid won't displace

10:50.124 --> 10:54.294
and will behave just like
an incompressible solid.

10:54.295 --> 10:56.629
Buster, my friend, things are looking up...

10:56.630 --> 10:58.698
75 feet up.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.133
That's a long way to fall.

11:00.134 --> 11:02.402
Anybody feel sorry for Buster?

11:02.403 --> 11:03.403
- No.
- No.

11:03.404 --> 11:05.805
Just checking. All right. Here we go.

11:05.806 --> 11:10.643
75-foot fall, feet first,
into water in 3, 2, 1...

11:12.747 --> 11:14.514
Oh!

11:14.515 --> 11:17.517
Ooh, that was a solid hit.

11:17.518 --> 11:20.587
And as Buster is raised and assessed,

11:20.588 --> 11:22.355
It looks like he's taken a severe pounding.

11:22.356 --> 11:26.359
But the data in the black box
holds the objective key.

11:26.360 --> 11:27.894
We got...

11:27.895 --> 11:28.895
29.

11:28.896 --> 11:30.964
No way.

11:30.965 --> 11:33.967
Yeah, so that's half of
what we got on pavement

11:33.968 --> 11:35.969
at three times the height.

11:35.970 --> 11:37.003
Wow.

11:37.004 --> 11:39.339
Not good news for the myth.

11:39.340 --> 11:41.141
The fall onto water at 75 feet

11:41.142 --> 11:44.444
is half as damaging as
pavement from 25 feet.

11:44.445 --> 11:48.681
But there's one more test
before the data set is complete...

11:48.682 --> 11:51.618
75 feet onto pavement.

11:54.755 --> 11:55.822
Oh.

11:58.993 --> 12:01.394
That had to hurt!

12:01.395 --> 12:04.664
Watching Buster fall
75 feet onto the pavement

12:04.665 --> 12:06.866
was painful.

12:06.867 --> 12:10.470
I mean, his body twisted in ways
that a human body never should.

12:10.471 --> 12:12.572
All right, so, we just dropped Buster

12:12.573 --> 12:15.108
75 feet, feet first, into the pavement.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.676
What kind of G's did we pull?

12:16.677 --> 12:17.777
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

12:17.778 --> 12:19.946
We absolutely maxed out our accelerometer.

12:19.947 --> 12:22.415
And "maxed out" means

12:22.416 --> 12:25.084
the "G" load was in excess of 500.

12:25.085 --> 12:29.255
That's an impact at least
17 times harder than the H2O.

12:29.256 --> 12:33.560
In these circumstances, water
clearly does not equal pavement.

12:33.561 --> 12:36.095
But the myth isn't sunk just yet,

12:36.096 --> 12:38.798
and here's Grant's theory as to why.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.267
Now, water is incompressible.
That's a fact of physics.

12:41.268 --> 12:43.403
And if I put my hand in
the water slow enough,

12:43.404 --> 12:45.872
the water can displace... it
can move out of the way.

12:45.873 --> 12:48.107
But if Buster were to hit
the water fast enough

12:48.108 --> 12:49.809
and if he had enough surface area,

12:49.810 --> 12:52.345
the water wouldn't have a
chance to get out of the way.

12:52.346 --> 12:54.047
And because it's incompressible...

12:55.349 --> 12:58.051
...there will be some point
at which the "G" force

12:58.052 --> 13:00.320
is equivalent between water and pavement.

13:00.321 --> 13:03.590
So, because surface area may be a factor,

13:03.591 --> 13:08.228
it's time to bring out the belly flop.

13:08.229 --> 13:09.696
Up next...

13:09.697 --> 13:13.533
The next distance we'll
be firing from is 500 yards...

13:13.534 --> 13:16.469
the distance of your
average restraining order.

13:22.590 --> 13:24.991
Adam and Jamie are testing the myth

13:24.992 --> 13:27.093
that you can literally dodge a bullet,

13:27.094 --> 13:30.997
provided the shooter is far enough away.

13:30.998 --> 13:34.067
And to find out, they've
got an expert sniper

13:34.068 --> 13:36.569
who's hitting the target
first time, every time...

13:38.005 --> 13:41.441
...and a clever foil-based
timing system that isn't.

13:42.543 --> 13:45.912
It didn't work. It didn't stop it.

13:45.913 --> 13:48.348
It's not working? It has to work!

13:48.349 --> 13:50.717
But despite the foil's initial failings,

13:50.718 --> 13:54.888
Adam and Jamie tweak, tinker, and persevere

13:54.889 --> 13:57.924
until the mysterious gremlins
in the system are iron out.

13:57.925 --> 14:00.527
200 yards. Time of flight.

14:00.528 --> 14:01.528
Fire at will.

14:05.199 --> 14:06.566
Hey! We got a number.

14:06.567 --> 14:08.101
What'd we get?

14:08.102 --> 14:10.337
231 milliseconds.

14:10.338 --> 14:12.172
- Let's move back.
- All right.

14:12.173 --> 14:14.607
With that first data
point finally in the bag,

14:14.608 --> 14:17.711
the team reset for the second shot.

14:17.712 --> 14:19.646
The next distance we'll be firing from

14:19.647 --> 14:23.316
is 500 yards... 1,500 feet,

14:23.317 --> 14:26.986
10 olympic swimming pools,
approximately, end to end,

14:26.987 --> 14:29.856
or the distance of your
average restraining order.

14:29.857 --> 14:31.257
And Dead-Eye Dave,

14:31.258 --> 14:33.460
once he's assumed the position, focuses...

14:36.797 --> 14:37.897
That's it.

14:37.898 --> 14:40.967
...and hits the bull's-eye again.

14:40.968 --> 14:44.070
Beautiful. We got a reading.

14:44.071 --> 14:45.772
- Love it.
- 597 milliseconds.

14:45.773 --> 14:47.974
So it's onwards and backwards,

14:47.975 --> 14:51.778
as the team sets up for
the third and final shot...

14:51.779 --> 14:54.981
Nice thing is the box gets
lighter the longer you walk.

14:56.250 --> 14:59.419
...this time from a massive
distance of 1,200 yards.

14:59.420 --> 15:02.689
The final distance we'll be
shooting from is 1,200 yards...

15:02.690 --> 15:05.959
roughly an 8-minute walk, a kilometer,

15:05.960 --> 15:07.994
to those of you in every
other part of the world

15:07.995 --> 15:09.429
besides the United States.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.164
And when I look at the target from here,

15:11.165 --> 15:12.565
I think, "what target"?

15:12.566 --> 15:17.003
But if anyone can make
this shot, it's sniper Dave.

15:17.004 --> 15:18.872
Sniping is actually pretty complicated.

15:18.873 --> 15:20.540
Your modern sniper shows up

15:20.541 --> 15:23.576
with a spotter and a computer
to get the job done.

15:23.577 --> 15:26.212
He's got to compensate
for several different things.

15:26.213 --> 15:27.247
Gravity.

15:27.248 --> 15:30.283
If our shooter is 1,200 feet away,

15:30.284 --> 15:33.887
to hit here, he's actually
got to aim at a point

15:33.888 --> 15:37.157
directly above, 30 feet in the air.

15:37.158 --> 15:40.293
- Okay. Time of flight.
- 1,200 yards.

15:40.294 --> 15:41.294
The wind.

15:41.295 --> 15:42.929
If the wind's blowing this way,

15:42.930 --> 15:45.031
then our shooter is gonna have to aim

15:45.032 --> 15:47.300
to this side of the target to compensate.

15:47.301 --> 15:48.568
Figure 6/10 left.

15:48.569 --> 15:51.070
Now, he's gonna be looking
at things like flags,

15:51.071 --> 15:53.473
if they're there, or even
the grass or mirages

15:53.474 --> 15:55.341
to get a clue as to what's going on.

15:55.342 --> 15:56.943
I'm picking up some surface mirage

15:56.944 --> 15:59.012
running right to left about
halfway down the range.

15:59.013 --> 16:00.547
Drag.

16:00.548 --> 16:03.683
Now, this is about air density,
and our shooter is gonna be

16:03.684 --> 16:06.386
looking at barometer,
at altitude, at temperature,

16:06.387 --> 16:08.321
to determine how dense the air is

16:08.322 --> 16:10.256
and be able to compensate for it.

16:10.257 --> 16:12.692
Kev, I got a light boil.

16:12.693 --> 16:14.160
Hold center and send it.

16:14.161 --> 16:17.797
Now, all these things are a lot
for a sniper to keep in mind

16:17.798 --> 16:19.199
when he's taking a shot.

16:19.200 --> 16:21.668
It's quite a feat, when you think about it.

16:22.670 --> 16:24.337
Never in doubt,

16:24.338 --> 16:27.006
Dave threads the eye
of the proverbial needle,

16:27.007 --> 16:29.209
and just as important...

16:29.210 --> 16:31.845
Ha! Beautiful! We got a reading.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.713
1.791 seconds to target.

16:33.714 --> 16:35.114
Excellent.

16:35.115 --> 16:38.451
All right. Let's draw a graph.

16:38.452 --> 16:39.919
Now that we've got our numbers,

16:39.920 --> 16:41.654
it's time to plot them on a graph.

16:41.655 --> 16:45.825
Let's start with the "x" axis...
12 increments of 100 yards each.

16:45.826 --> 16:47.961
The "y" axis, going up and down,

16:47.962 --> 16:50.597
that's time, from zero to two seconds,

16:50.598 --> 16:52.298
in 1/4-second increments.

16:52.299 --> 16:55.235
Then we draw a grid and
plot out our bullet times.

16:55.236 --> 16:57.403
The first bullet, from 200 yards,

16:57.404 --> 17:00.006
took 231 milliseconds to reach its target.

17:00.007 --> 17:04.611
The second bullet, from 500
yards, took 597 milliseconds.

17:04.612 --> 17:07.213
The third bullet, from 1,200 yards,

17:07.214 --> 17:11.451
took 1,790 milliseconds
to reach its target.

17:11.452 --> 17:14.053
We then draw a line between
these three points and see...

17:14.054 --> 17:15.488
Oh!... it's perfectly straight.

17:15.489 --> 17:17.223
That means we can take any distance

17:17.223 --> 17:18.491
and plot the amount of time

17:18.492 --> 17:20.359
it would take the bullet to get there.

17:20.361 --> 17:22.228
Or, conversely, we could choose a time

17:22.229 --> 17:24.464
and figure out how far
away you'd have to shoot

17:24.464 --> 17:26.532
for the bullet to take that length of time.

17:26.534 --> 17:28.735
Isn't graphing lovely?

17:28.736 --> 17:31.204
The day started badly.

17:32.206 --> 17:34.741
But thanks to Dave and his spotter,

17:34.742 --> 17:38.144
they've got the numbers they
need to kick-start this myth.

17:38.145 --> 17:40.380
Well, we got our figures.

17:40.381 --> 17:42.315
We now know how long it'll take the bullet

17:42.316 --> 17:44.484
to reach its target from
any distance we choose.

17:44.485 --> 17:45.785
Well, now we need to know

17:45.786 --> 17:47.820
how quickly we can jump
out of the way, huh?

17:47.821 --> 17:49.689
Human-reaction tests it is. Let's do it.

17:49.690 --> 17:52.792
I can't believe he can hit
that target from here.

17:52.793 --> 17:55.295
Hit the target? I can't even see it.

18:00.367 --> 18:03.503
All incompressible materials are equal,

18:03.504 --> 18:06.606
but so far, some are
more equal than others.

18:06.607 --> 18:09.008
When Buster is dropped feet first,

18:09.009 --> 18:12.045
water has nothing like
the impact of pavement.

18:12.046 --> 18:15.548
The angle of entry means
the water is easily displaced.

18:15.549 --> 18:19.352
Yeah, so, that's half of
what we got on pavement

18:19.353 --> 18:20.920
at three times the height.

18:20.921 --> 18:22.989
But what if that was
changed to a belly flop?

18:22.990 --> 18:24.557
Time to hog-tie him.

18:24.558 --> 18:27.093
Will the additional surface area

18:27.094 --> 18:31.130
save this scientific saga from sinking?

18:31.131 --> 18:34.400
So, in case you're wondering
...and I'm pretty sure you are...

18:34.401 --> 18:37.804
dropping Buster on his face
repeatedly just doesn't get old.

18:37.805 --> 18:39.572
All right, this is Buster's belly flop

18:39.573 --> 18:41.674
into pavement from 25 feet.

18:41.675 --> 18:43.876
In 3, 2, 1...

18:44.878 --> 18:45.878
Oh!

18:45.879 --> 18:47.547
- Ow!
- Oh, ho, ho, ho!

18:47.548 --> 18:49.849
That looked painful.

18:49.850 --> 18:52.218
And without his legs breaking his fall,

18:52.219 --> 18:57.323
the "G" load was much higher
than the feet-first test.

18:57.324 --> 19:00.660
So, we just dropped Buster
chest first on the pavement.

19:00.661 --> 19:03.630
We got 286 G's.

19:03.631 --> 19:06.799
Now what we're gonna do
is do the same thing on water,

19:06.800 --> 19:09.869
and my feeling is we're
gonna see very similar results,

19:09.870 --> 19:11.070
and I think anybody who's ever

19:11.071 --> 19:13.072
jumped off a diving board
and done a belly flop

19:13.073 --> 19:15.508
will understand what I'm talking about.

19:15.509 --> 19:18.978
This is gonna hurt. In 3, 2, 1...

19:20.347 --> 19:22.248
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

19:22.249 --> 19:24.317
I give that dive a 9.

19:26.186 --> 19:28.454
Okay, so, belly-flopping,

19:28.455 --> 19:33.760
Buster on pavement at 25 feet was 290 G's.

19:33.761 --> 19:35.461
And on water, it was 115.

19:35.462 --> 19:37.363
And what that means is, sure,

19:37.364 --> 19:39.432
water is not as hard as pavement,

19:39.433 --> 19:40.833
but it was a lot closer

19:40.834 --> 19:43.236
than when we dropped Buster feet first.

19:43.237 --> 19:44.737
So, surface area is important.

19:44.738 --> 19:46.305
The more surface area you have,

19:46.306 --> 19:48.508
the harder it is to displace the water.

19:48.509 --> 19:51.210
Now, what if Buster
was moving a lot faster?

19:51.211 --> 19:52.979
Then we might see the difference

19:52.980 --> 19:55.515
between the water and the
pavement decrease again.

19:55.516 --> 19:56.683
Let's see.

19:56.684 --> 19:59.085
So, the team thinks speed is the key,

19:59.086 --> 20:03.222
and to get Buster moving faster,
they need to take him higher.

20:03.223 --> 20:06.092
This is dropping Buster from 50 feet

20:06.093 --> 20:08.728
in the belly-flop position over water.

20:08.729 --> 20:09.896
Here we go.

20:09.897 --> 20:11.764
In 3, 2, 1...

20:11.765 --> 20:13.166
Oh!

20:13.167 --> 20:15.835
- Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

20:15.836 --> 20:18.805
Look at the wave that's coming out.

20:18.806 --> 20:20.406
So, dropping Buster from 50 feet

20:20.407 --> 20:23.109
actually peeled the skin off of his side.

20:23.110 --> 20:27.146
It was such an impact that
all of us, I think, felt it.

20:27.147 --> 20:30.316
So it looks like, on water at 50 feet,

20:30.317 --> 20:32.952
the belly flop is giving us 220 G's.

20:32.953 --> 20:35.488
Now for the all-important comparison.

20:35.489 --> 20:38.291
Will the 50-foot pavement plummet

20:38.292 --> 20:41.928
be any closer to water
than the 25-foot test?

20:43.197 --> 20:45.665
Take it up. 50 feet.

20:45.666 --> 20:48.167
50 feet.

20:48.168 --> 20:49.702
He might not survive this, you know?

20:49.703 --> 20:51.504
Yeah, 25 looked like it hurt.

20:51.505 --> 20:54.440
3, 2, 1.

20:54.441 --> 20:56.209
Ugh.

20:56.210 --> 20:59.278
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

20:59.279 --> 21:00.947
Hey, he's still in one piece.

21:00.948 --> 21:02.648
Tell me you didn't feel that.

21:02.649 --> 21:04.183
That one made me throw up.

21:04.184 --> 21:06.452
I am so glad it was him and not me.

21:07.755 --> 21:10.990
All right. Let's
find out how he did.

21:10.991 --> 21:13.226
That was intense.

21:13.227 --> 21:17.263
In fact, it was so intense,
the meter maxed out,

21:17.264 --> 21:21.067
meaning Buster pulled
a "G" load of 500-plus.

21:21.068 --> 21:23.703
Oh, my God. That's a hard hit.

21:23.704 --> 21:25.838
Buster is bruised and battered.

21:25.839 --> 21:29.108
But with the meter unable to
register the force of the fall,

21:29.109 --> 21:32.245
where does that leave the myth?

21:32.246 --> 21:33.713
So, we've maxed out our meter.

21:33.714 --> 21:36.616
That means that we can't compare
numbers to the 25-foot drop.

21:36.617 --> 21:38.684
Now, it's possible as you go higher

21:38.685 --> 21:41.154
that water could become more like pavement.

21:41.155 --> 21:44.157
We just can't test it here,
right now, with this meter.

21:44.158 --> 21:46.425
So that means we have to do two things.

21:46.426 --> 21:48.661
First, we have to find a
more mythbustery way

21:48.662 --> 21:51.464
to compare the fall onto water
versus the fall on concrete.

21:51.465 --> 21:53.199
And second, once we've done that,

21:53.200 --> 21:55.067
we have to perform more experiments,

21:55.068 --> 21:57.970
but this time at a much greater height.

21:57.971 --> 22:01.541
So high, in fact, that we
reach terminal velocity.

22:01.542 --> 22:02.775
Coming up...

22:02.776 --> 22:05.378
So, I turned into one of the three stooges.

22:05.379 --> 22:09.182
...Adam and Jamie time their
bullet-dodging reactions.

22:13.797 --> 22:15.631
- We got some good numbers from our sniper.
- What's next?

22:15.632 --> 22:17.433
I think the moment has come

22:17.434 --> 22:19.334
to time another element of this story.

22:19.335 --> 22:22.438
- Human reaction time?
- Exactly.

22:22.439 --> 22:24.139
If you had to dodge a bullet,

22:24.140 --> 22:26.575
just how quickly could
you get out of its way?

22:26.576 --> 22:28.911
I think I'm gonna go get a cup of coffee.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.713
See, he's gonna get a cup of coffee.

22:30.714 --> 22:32.081
It's gonna make him really hyper,

22:32.082 --> 22:33.849
and he's gonna get out
of the way really fast.

22:33.850 --> 22:37.119
So, they've got the
numbers for flight time,

22:37.120 --> 22:39.188
and in their attempt
to deconstruct this myth

22:39.189 --> 22:41.323
without actually
shooting at each other...

22:42.826 --> 22:43.992
It works.

22:43.993 --> 22:46.628
...the next piece of data
is how long it will take

22:46.629 --> 22:49.832
to react and move out of the way.

22:49.833 --> 22:52.601
This test is all about measuring
a human being's reaction time.

22:52.602 --> 22:54.203
This is our human being.

22:54.204 --> 22:57.639
His task... to get himself
out of the path of a bullet

22:57.640 --> 22:59.942
described by the "X" on his chest

22:59.943 --> 23:01.710
and the bull's-eye behind him.

23:01.711 --> 23:04.413
His signal to move, that
the "shot" has been fired,

23:04.414 --> 23:06.782
will be given by this digital camera flash,

23:06.783 --> 23:09.051
remotely triggered by me from back there.

23:09.052 --> 23:12.621
All of this will be captured...

23:12.622 --> 23:15.424
by our lovely digital
high-speed camera, which,

23:15.425 --> 23:18.727
when we review the footage
of Jamie's "dodging a bullet",

23:18.728 --> 23:20.729
will allow us to time

23:20.730 --> 23:23.465
exactly how many milliseconds
it took him to do it.

23:23.466 --> 23:25.367
All right. Are you ready, Jamie?

23:25.368 --> 23:29.071
Human-reaction-time speed test

23:29.072 --> 23:32.908
At some random point
in the very near future.

23:35.311 --> 23:36.912
Nice.

23:36.913 --> 23:38.947
Jamie's fast.

23:38.948 --> 23:43.652
His hoosier reflexes are honed
to an almost superhero speed.

23:43.653 --> 23:45.053
Nice work there, cowboy.

23:45.054 --> 23:48.056
You want to man the remote
flash while I try a couple?

23:48.057 --> 23:49.057
Okay.

23:49.058 --> 23:51.126
Adam, on the other hand,

23:51.127 --> 23:55.731
makes up for his slow reactions
with his lack of grace.

23:55.732 --> 23:57.900
Now to assess the results.

23:57.901 --> 23:59.101
Here's mine.

23:59.102 --> 24:02.304
So, I turned into one of the three stooges.

24:05.575 --> 24:08.744
But the Hyneman legend continues to grow.

24:10.914 --> 24:13.081
Oh! Dude!

24:13.082 --> 24:15.217
Check his bad self out.

24:15.218 --> 24:18.320
He's a bullet-dodging hoosier.

24:18.321 --> 24:22.558
Despite Jamie practicing and
honing his "matrix"-style sway

24:22.559 --> 24:24.960
with an artful economy of motion,

24:24.961 --> 24:29.031
it turns out that both Jamie and
Adam clocked very similar times.

24:29.032 --> 24:33.235
They're both clear of the target
in around 500 milliseconds.

24:33.236 --> 24:34.736
But just for the record...

24:34.737 --> 24:37.406
and this is the figure
they'll take forward...

24:37.407 --> 24:38.607
Jamie takes the gold

24:38.608 --> 24:42.411
with a personal best of 490 milliseconds.

24:42.412 --> 24:44.813
With practice, I was able
to get my reaction time down

24:44.814 --> 24:46.081
to about 1/8 of a second,

24:46.082 --> 24:47.983
and I was able to clear the bull's-eye

24:47.984 --> 24:49.218
in less than 1/2 a second.

24:49.219 --> 24:51.420
Now, this is a best-case scenario,

24:51.421 --> 24:53.822
but that's actually what we want here,

24:53.823 --> 24:56.258
because we want to see what is possible

24:56.259 --> 24:59.328
in terms of how close a sniper could be

24:59.329 --> 25:03.332
and you would still, in theory,
be able to dodge his bullet.

25:03.333 --> 25:07.202
And for that distance, it's
back to Adam and his graph.

25:07.203 --> 25:08.804
All right, editors, help me out here

25:08.805 --> 25:10.772
and put the original graph
back on the screen.

25:10.773 --> 25:12.975
Time on the "y" axis, distance on the "x."

25:12.976 --> 25:17.212
Now, if I draw a line from
490 milliseconds out to our plot

25:17.213 --> 25:22.284
and check out the corresponding
distance, it's 400 yards.

25:22.285 --> 25:24.219
That is the theoretical distance

25:24.220 --> 25:26.922
at which you could possibly dodge a bullet,

25:26.923 --> 25:31.260
but only if you could see the
muzzle flash from that distance.

25:31.261 --> 25:32.794
That's what we're about to find out.

25:32.795 --> 25:36.064
And that means a return to the range

25:36.065 --> 25:38.133
for a test where the eyes have it.

25:38.134 --> 25:41.570
The question is, how far away
can you see the rifle firing?

25:41.571 --> 25:43.672
Now, note, you cannot rely on sound

25:43.673 --> 25:45.173
because the bullet travels

25:45.174 --> 25:47.609
four times faster than the speed of sound.

25:47.610 --> 25:50.212
You'll get hit by it
long before you hear it.

25:50.213 --> 25:52.147
This has to be a visual cue.

25:52.148 --> 25:55.117
A visual cue and a simple plan.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.419
Adam and Jamie will stand downrange

25:57.420 --> 25:59.221
and look for the muzzle flash

25:59.222 --> 26:02.624
as sniper Dave shoots at a nearby target.

26:02.625 --> 26:06.628
A little motivation for our sniper.

26:08.364 --> 26:10.699
But rest assured, for safety,

26:10.700 --> 26:12.234
Dave will be firing blanks.

26:12.235 --> 26:15.237
This is the real thing,
and this is a blank,

26:15.238 --> 26:16.939
but this isn't just any blank.

26:16.940 --> 26:19.608
This is a theatrical blank
that we've selected

26:19.609 --> 26:22.044
specifically because what comes out of it

26:22.045 --> 26:26.048
looks exactly the same as what
comes out of the real McCoy.

26:26.049 --> 26:27.249
And first up,

26:27.250 --> 26:29.351
they're facing the firing
squad from 100 yards.

26:30.653 --> 26:32.554
- I saw it.
- I saw it.

26:32.555 --> 26:35.657
Okay, Dave, let's move back to 150.

26:35.658 --> 26:37.793
- Cool.
- Roger. Moving.

26:37.794 --> 26:41.697
At 100 yards, the flash
is as clear as a bell,

26:41.698 --> 26:44.199
and that's also true of 150.

26:45.234 --> 26:46.468
- Saw it.
- I saw it.

26:46.469 --> 26:49.771
But 200 yards is a different story.

26:49.772 --> 26:53.175
Okay, Dave, 200 yards. Fire at will.

26:54.911 --> 26:57.579
I didn't see that.
Let's have him do that again.

26:57.580 --> 27:00.148
Dave, let's have one more go.

27:03.353 --> 27:04.419
Did you see it?

27:04.420 --> 27:06.321
I'd say that's at the borderline.

27:06.322 --> 27:09.157
Well, if you got the eagle eyes,
let's push another 25 yards.

27:09.158 --> 27:10.826
And at 225 yards,

27:10.827 --> 27:15.263
even eagle-eyed Jamie
fails to focus on the flash.

27:17.467 --> 27:18.633
No, I don't have it.

27:18.634 --> 27:20.769
- No. 200 yards is our threshold.
- Yeah.

27:20.770 --> 27:23.872
With our blank rounds
matched to a sniper's round,

27:23.873 --> 27:26.942
our ability to see the
rifle firing is 200 yards.

27:26.943 --> 27:29.678
If you look at that on our graph...

27:29.679 --> 27:33.315
Yeah, it's not quite enough time
for us to get out of the way.

27:33.316 --> 27:36.251
Remember, based on the bullet travel time

27:36.252 --> 27:39.087
coupled with the human reaction time,

27:39.088 --> 27:42.758
400 yards was the minimum
distance needed to dodge.

27:42.759 --> 27:45.360
But at just half that distance,

27:45.361 --> 27:47.763
you can't even see the muzzle flash.

27:47.764 --> 27:48.864
I don't have it.

27:48.865 --> 27:51.366
Luckily, Adam has a plan.

27:51.367 --> 27:53.168
Not all blanks are created equal,

27:53.169 --> 27:55.370
and on "MythBusters", we
always like to find out,

27:55.371 --> 27:57.339
what is the best-possible-case scenario?

27:57.340 --> 27:59.708
In Hollywood, for instance,
a blank for that rifle

27:59.709 --> 28:02.110
includes a lot more fire
coming out of the tip,

28:02.111 --> 28:04.246
'cause that's more visual for the movies.

28:04.247 --> 28:06.114
So, that's what we're going to do.

28:06.115 --> 28:07.916
We're going to start from this distance

28:07.917 --> 28:09.551
with a full Hollywood flaming blank

28:09.552 --> 28:13.889
and see how far we can see that
rifle firing with one of these.

28:13.890 --> 28:16.958
In other words, for
the time being, at least,

28:16.959 --> 28:19.494
it's out with reality
and in with Hollywood.

28:19.495 --> 28:22.030
And the difference is like night and day.

28:22.031 --> 28:24.900
Okay, Dave, 225. Fire at will.

28:26.169 --> 28:27.335
Oh, I saw that.

28:27.336 --> 28:28.737
I totally saw that.

28:28.738 --> 28:30.672
- Let's go to 400.
- Okay.

28:30.673 --> 28:33.942
The Hollywood round is the
gift that keeps on giving

28:33.943 --> 28:38.246
because it's visible at 400, 800...

28:38.247 --> 28:39.614
I totally saw that.

28:39.615 --> 28:40.782
I did. I saw it.

28:40.783 --> 28:43.418
...and even 1,200 yards.

28:45.822 --> 28:46.822
I saw that.

28:46.823 --> 28:47.956
Totally saw it. Wait...

28:47.957 --> 28:49.291
...and I heard it.

28:50.359 --> 28:52.160
That's plenty of time
to get out of the way.

28:52.161 --> 28:53.462
Adam's right.

28:53.463 --> 28:56.131
Dodging the Hollywood round
sounds like child's play,

28:56.132 --> 29:01.503
but the real-world round is
altogether more challenging.

29:01.504 --> 29:03.705
Next on "MythBusters"...

29:03.706 --> 29:05.006
This pig doesn't want to fly.

29:05.007 --> 29:06.708
...the team preps

29:06.709 --> 29:09.177
for a terminal-velocity pork belly flop.

29:09.178 --> 29:11.179
- I know what to call it.
- What?

29:11.180 --> 29:13.748
- A pork chopper!
- Oh!

29:17.500 --> 29:19.968
So, the increased surface
area of the belly flop

29:19.969 --> 29:22.871
is looking promising, but we
need to go higher and faster.

29:22.872 --> 29:24.306
How high and fast are you thinking?

29:24.307 --> 29:25.774
Ooh, what about terminal velocity...

29:25.775 --> 29:27.309
600 feet from a helicopter?

29:27.310 --> 29:28.477
That'd do it.

29:28.478 --> 29:29.911
But we're gonna have to figure out

29:29.912 --> 29:31.480
a different way to measure these falls,

29:31.481 --> 29:33.849
because Buster's in pieces
and the meter's maxing out.

29:33.850 --> 29:36.618
What about pigs? We could
compare bone breakage.

29:36.619 --> 29:37.686
Seriously?

29:40.356 --> 29:43.125
So, to test whether falling onto water

29:43.126 --> 29:45.560
is the same as falling onto pavement,

29:45.561 --> 29:47.796
we've come to Shadow Cliffs regional park.

29:47.797 --> 29:50.499
Now, so far, in the feet-first position,

29:50.500 --> 29:52.501
they're not very similar at all.

29:52.502 --> 29:55.837
But in the belly-flop position,
they're actually quite similar.

29:55.838 --> 29:58.607
The only problem is that our accelerometer,

29:58.608 --> 30:01.877
our measuring device, has
maxed out at only 50 feet.

30:01.878 --> 30:05.314
Oh, my God, that's a hard hit.

30:05.315 --> 30:07.015
And that's why we're here.

30:07.016 --> 30:09.985
Because this time, we're
going to drop our items

30:09.986 --> 30:11.653
from a much greater height.

30:11.654 --> 30:14.856
So high, in fact, that they
get to terminal velocity.

30:14.857 --> 30:17.092
The reason we want terminal velocity

30:17.093 --> 30:20.062
is the objects will never
be going faster than that

30:20.063 --> 30:23.098
and therefore never have
a greater impact than that.

30:23.099 --> 30:27.002
So, to give the myth the
best chance of working,

30:27.003 --> 30:29.104
the team will be comparing a 600-feet fall

30:29.105 --> 30:31.106
onto pavement and water.

30:31.107 --> 30:34.576
Come on! Let's go! Get to the chopper!

30:34.577 --> 30:36.978
But how exactly will they compare the two?

30:36.979 --> 30:40.148
All right, so, we maxed
out our accelerometers,

30:40.149 --> 30:43.085
but we still need to figure out
a way to measure the impact

30:43.086 --> 30:45.120
when falling on pavement and on water.

30:45.121 --> 30:46.355
So, we can't use a human,

30:46.356 --> 30:48.623
'cause, obviously, that's
gonna kill somebody,

30:48.624 --> 30:50.292
so we decided to go with a pig.

30:50.293 --> 30:51.960
Ugh.

30:51.961 --> 30:54.830
To collect comparative data,
we're going to X-ray the pigs,

30:54.831 --> 30:56.865
but then we're gonna have
an orthopedic surgeon

30:56.866 --> 30:59.101
analyze those X-rays, see
how many bones are broken,

30:59.102 --> 31:01.737
and what kind of damage happened
when it hit the pavement,

31:01.738 --> 31:04.172
and we'll find out if water
is as hard as pavement...

31:04.173 --> 31:06.441
...and what I had for lunch.

31:06.442 --> 31:09.978
It's gruesome, but with no way of measuring

31:09.979 --> 31:11.847
the force of the fall electronically,

31:11.848 --> 31:15.016
a comparison of the
physical damage incurred

31:15.017 --> 31:17.586
will perfectly illustrate the
difference between water...

31:17.587 --> 31:20.155
...and pavement.

31:20.156 --> 31:23.792
Okay. I think he's ready.
Let's get the bag.

31:24.694 --> 31:28.130
But the squeamish amongst
you can rest assured

31:28.131 --> 31:31.733
the pigs will always be
concealed in sealed bags,

31:31.734 --> 31:33.969
even when it comes time
to assess the damage,

31:33.970 --> 31:36.671
because that will be done
with a portable X-ray.

31:36.672 --> 31:39.342
This X-ray is cool technology.
How fast does it work?

31:39.343 --> 31:41.244
Well, from the moment we push the button

31:41.245 --> 31:43.846
till the moment we're seeing
the X-ray is about 5 seconds.

31:43.847 --> 31:46.716
So, is this the weirdest thing
you've ever done with it?

31:46.717 --> 31:48.985
It's like a pig sleeping bag.

31:48.986 --> 31:50.820
I'd have to say it is.

31:50.821 --> 31:52.488
All right. Bag that pig.

31:52.489 --> 31:53.723
Nice.

31:53.724 --> 31:55.825
So, we're using this specially designed

31:55.826 --> 31:58.694
military-grade plastic
bag with welded seams.

31:58.695 --> 32:00.963
It's designed so that when
you suck the air out,

32:00.964 --> 32:03.466
it will minimize the possibility
of rupturing the bag,

32:03.467 --> 32:06.135
thus preventing further gruesomeness.

32:06.136 --> 32:09.672
Essential to the validity of the result

32:09.673 --> 32:13.709
is the requirement that both
pigs fall at the same speed.

32:13.710 --> 32:16.345
Cue a cute little stabilizing chute.

32:16.346 --> 32:18.781
So, now that we have our two identical pigs

32:18.782 --> 32:22.084
in two identical bags... one for
pavement and one for water...

32:22.085 --> 32:23.719
it's time to attach the chute.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.588
Now, why do we need a chute?

32:25.589 --> 32:26.889
Well, terminal velocity

32:26.890 --> 32:29.625
depends on the orientation
that the object falls.

32:29.626 --> 32:32.528
Since we want to keep our
pig in belly-flop position,

32:32.529 --> 32:35.131
we're attaching this stabilization chute,

32:35.132 --> 32:38.267
which will provide just enough
drag to keep it like this

32:38.268 --> 32:40.570
without affecting terminal velocity.

32:40.571 --> 32:42.839
First up... pavement.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.507
This pig doesn't want to fly.

32:44.508 --> 32:46.943
Yeah, I'm pretty sure if
you were gonna push me

32:46.944 --> 32:49.512
out of a helicopter, I
wouldn't cooperate, either.

32:49.513 --> 32:50.513
All right.

32:50.514 --> 32:52.315
So, the pig is in the helicopter.

32:52.316 --> 32:54.784
Operation "Pork Drop" is ready to commence.

32:54.785 --> 32:56.953
Oh, God, I'm not looking forward to this.

32:56.954 --> 32:58.387
Okay. We'll be on the ground.

32:58.388 --> 32:59.422
Good luck.

32:59.423 --> 33:00.523
Heads up.

33:00.524 --> 33:02.291
- I know what to call it.
- What?

33:02.292 --> 33:05.628
- A pork chopper!
- Oh!

33:05.629 --> 33:08.598
Operation "Pork Drop"
is all set to commence.

33:08.599 --> 33:12.101
At the target altitude of 600 feet,

33:12.102 --> 33:16.305
Tory will help our porcine
fall guy into free fall

33:16.306 --> 33:18.241
by kicking him out of the chopper.

33:18.242 --> 33:20.843
You guys ready?

33:20.844 --> 33:23.346
Just so you know, if that bag breaks,

33:23.347 --> 33:25.348
I'm going to vomit all over you.

33:25.349 --> 33:28.584
That sucks. This is my weekend shirt.

33:29.887 --> 33:34.190
Okay, Tory, we are in
position, and we are ready.

33:34.191 --> 33:36.058
All right. Here we go.

33:38.228 --> 33:40.062
Coming up on "MythBusters",

33:40.063 --> 33:42.331
Jamie is staring down the barrel.

33:42.332 --> 33:44.500
The distance I'll be
shooting at Jamie from...

33:44.501 --> 33:48.704
I love that sentence... is 400 yards.

33:53.291 --> 33:55.559
Now, on one hand,
we've got our ideal number.

33:55.560 --> 33:57.561
Based on our human-reaction-time tests

33:57.562 --> 33:59.329
and our bullet-flight-time tests,

33:59.330 --> 34:01.598
we know that the minimum
theoretical distance

34:01.599 --> 34:03.800
you could dodge a bullet from is 400 yards.

34:03.801 --> 34:05.002
Okay.

34:05.003 --> 34:07.337
On the other hand, we've
got our maximum distance

34:07.338 --> 34:09.873
you could actually see
the sniper's rifle being fired,

34:09.873 --> 34:11.408
which is only 200 yards away.

34:11.409 --> 34:13.043
So, at our theoretical minimum,

34:13.043 --> 34:15.212
you never see the cue
to jump out of the way.

34:15.213 --> 34:17.281
Yeah, it's not looking good for the myth.

34:17.282 --> 34:18.815
But we still got to try it.

34:18.815 --> 34:20.417
Absolutely. I mean, who knows?

34:20.418 --> 34:23.219
At 200 yards, staring down
the barrel of a sniper's rifle,

34:23.221 --> 34:26.623
perhaps your adrenaline kicks in
and you become super-fast.

34:26.623 --> 34:27.690
It's worth a shot.

34:27.692 --> 34:29.760
But you do realize we can't actually

34:29.761 --> 34:31.762
shoot each other with real bullets.

34:31.763 --> 34:33.864
Aha! I've got a plan
for that. Check it out.

34:33.864 --> 34:35.899
Here is our sniper, and here is our target.

34:35.900 --> 34:37.801
The sniper fires a blank round,

34:37.802 --> 34:40.603
and when he pulls his
trigger, he clicks a switch.

34:40.605 --> 34:44.341
That switch sets a timer timing
for the precise length of time

34:44.342 --> 34:46.643
- that bullet would fly through the air.
- Yeah?

34:46.643 --> 34:49.980
At the exact millisecond
it's supposed to hit the target,

34:49.981 --> 34:53.516
the timer signals a paintball
gun to fire a paintball at you.

34:53.518 --> 34:55.686
It's an ouch, but it's not deadly.

34:55.687 --> 34:56.954
So, from 200 yards,

34:56.955 --> 35:00.223
the flight time we're
looking at is 231 milliseconds.

35:00.224 --> 35:01.725
Exactly.

35:03.294 --> 35:07.497
With death off the menu,
the guys run away to the runway,

35:07.498 --> 35:10.000
where Jamie starts setting up with the gun.

35:10.001 --> 35:15.205
And 200 yards downrange,
Adam gets to work on the target.

35:15.206 --> 35:17.641
There it is. "X" marks the spot.

35:17.642 --> 35:21.211
Then comes the complicated bit... timers...

35:21.212 --> 35:22.312
wires...

35:22.313 --> 35:23.580
Nice.

35:23.581 --> 35:24.915
...paintball guns...

35:24.916 --> 35:26.016
Isn't that cool?

35:26.017 --> 35:28.719
- ...and remote triggers.
- Beauty.

35:28.720 --> 35:31.655
Now, since we can't use
real bullets for this test,

35:31.656 --> 35:34.424
but we've gathered the
information that tells us

35:34.425 --> 35:36.793
the exact bullet flight time
for any distance we choose...

35:36.794 --> 35:37.828
Perfect.

35:37.829 --> 35:39.563
...we are going to imitate

35:39.564 --> 35:41.832
the bullet's flight electronically.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.266
Here's how.

35:43.267 --> 35:46.403
When this gun fires a blank, a
wire I've mounted on the trigger

35:46.404 --> 35:48.071
is gonna close the circuit...

35:48.072 --> 35:49.606
...which starts this timer timing.

35:49.607 --> 35:51.642
It will count down for
the precise length of time

35:51.643 --> 35:53.510
the bullet should be
flying through the air,

35:53.511 --> 35:55.679
and at the instant it is
supposed to hit its target,

35:55.680 --> 35:56.947
it will tell this paintball gun

35:56.948 --> 35:59.416
to fire a round directly
into Jamie's chest.

35:59.417 --> 36:01.685
Now, will he be able to get out in time?

36:01.686 --> 36:03.420
- I think I might.
- No, not yet.

36:03.421 --> 36:05.555
That's what we're about to find out.

36:05.556 --> 36:08.692
But first there's
the obligatory costume change...

36:08.693 --> 36:11.728
Jamie into something that will
clearly show the paintball,

36:11.729 --> 36:14.264
and Adam into something
of his own choosing.

36:14.265 --> 36:16.933
Where is that guy?

36:16.934 --> 36:18.101
Adam?

36:18.102 --> 36:19.503
Adam!

36:22.073 --> 36:23.407
Here I am.

36:23.408 --> 36:25.575
- Are you done screwing around?
- Yeah.

36:25.576 --> 36:27.077
- Let's get to work.
- Okay.

36:27.078 --> 36:29.112
Jamie might be able to dodge a bullet,

36:29.113 --> 36:30.514
but can he dance like this?

36:30.515 --> 36:32.549
In their respective outfits,

36:32.550 --> 36:35.585
the guys assume their
positions 200 yards apart.

36:35.586 --> 36:38.689
And, remember, 200 yards
was the maximum distance

36:38.690 --> 36:41.992
from which the guys could
see a genuine muzzle flash.

36:41.993 --> 36:45.062
The question is, does that leave
the caffeine-fueled Hyneman

36:45.063 --> 36:48.031
enough time to dodge out of the way?

36:48.032 --> 36:50.500
All right, Jamie, this
one's from 200 yards.

36:50.501 --> 36:51.501
Are you ready?

36:51.502 --> 36:53.403
Okay. Fire at will.

36:53.404 --> 36:54.604
All right.

36:54.605 --> 36:56.073
Jamie, poised to dodge,

36:56.074 --> 36:58.308
waits for Adam to fire
the muzzle-flash blank

36:58.309 --> 37:01.878
that will, in turn,
trigger the paintball gun

37:01.879 --> 37:05.048
the required 230 milliseconds later.

37:05.049 --> 37:07.684
But when that will be, only Adam knows.

37:10.822 --> 37:12.155
Did I get you?

37:12.156 --> 37:14.091
Got me. Give me a second.

37:14.092 --> 37:16.927
Although Jamie clearly
saw the muzzle flash,

37:16.928 --> 37:19.663
he had barely moved before the time was up

37:19.664 --> 37:22.466
and the paintball was fired into his chest.

37:22.467 --> 37:26.002
Undeterred, Jamie tries
a couple more times...

37:27.705 --> 37:28.839
...but to no avail.

37:31.876 --> 37:33.343
Damn.

37:33.344 --> 37:35.912
At 200 yards, I could see the flash.

37:35.913 --> 37:38.815
I reacted to it and started
moving out of its way,

37:38.816 --> 37:41.118
but I just couldn't do it fast enough.

37:41.119 --> 37:44.187
Given that their quickest
human-reaction result

37:44.188 --> 37:46.156
was 490 milliseconds...

37:47.859 --> 37:52.095
...trying to dodge a 200-yard
round in 230 milliseconds

37:52.096 --> 37:55.665
was always looking like a superhuman feat.

37:55.666 --> 37:56.602
This myth is looking totally busted,

37:56.603 --> 37:58.470
but we've come too far to give up.

37:58.471 --> 38:01.206
We're going to switch to a
Hollywood muzzle flash...

38:01.207 --> 38:04.276
- I totally saw that.
- I did. I saw it.

38:04.277 --> 38:06.478
...push the gun back to 400 yards,

38:06.479 --> 38:09.681
which gives us 500 milliseconds
to get out of the way,

38:09.682 --> 38:12.751
and see if it's theoretically
possible to dodge a bullet.

38:12.752 --> 38:15.087
The distance I'll be
shooting at Jamie from...

38:15.088 --> 38:19.058
...I love that sentence... is 400 yards.

38:19.059 --> 38:21.293
This is the minimum amount of time

38:21.294 --> 38:23.429
Jamie and his quick reflexes need

38:23.430 --> 38:25.598
to get out of the way in time.

38:25.599 --> 38:27.433
To give him the best chance, I'll be using

38:27.434 --> 38:28.767
a full-flash Hollywood blank,

38:28.768 --> 38:31.604
which is far brighter than
the actual sniper round.

38:31.605 --> 38:33.239
I'm set and ready.

38:33.240 --> 38:35.474
- Okay. Fire at will.
- Copy that.

38:37.244 --> 38:38.911
He got me.

38:38.912 --> 38:40.980
It's not the start Jamie wanted,

38:40.981 --> 38:42.882
but he's not gonna give up without a fight.

38:42.883 --> 38:45.351
Okay, Adam, fire at will.

38:46.586 --> 38:48.320
You got me again.

38:48.321 --> 38:49.922
A very long fight.

38:49.923 --> 38:51.223
With each shot...

38:52.292 --> 38:56.095
...Jamie is making progress
as he hones his technique.

38:56.096 --> 38:57.296
That was close.

38:57.297 --> 38:59.932
But he never quite hones it enough.

38:59.933 --> 39:01.967
So, can Adam do any better?

39:01.968 --> 39:03.235
Do you want to try?

39:03.236 --> 39:06.438
You bet I do!

39:06.439 --> 39:08.073
Adam, poised like a panther,

39:08.074 --> 39:12.344
gives Jamie the signal and then...

39:14.714 --> 39:17.249
...gets shot in the chest...

39:17.250 --> 39:18.517
again...

39:18.518 --> 39:19.518
and again...

39:19.519 --> 39:21.186
and again.

39:21.187 --> 39:22.488
Well, that was interesting.

39:22.489 --> 39:25.391
At 400 yards, we've got 500 milliseconds

39:25.392 --> 39:28.394
to react and get out of the way,
which ought to be enough time,

39:28.395 --> 39:29.595
but there's a difference

39:29.596 --> 39:31.864
between the shop test
and the real-world test.

39:31.865 --> 39:34.600
In the shop, we had this super-bright flash

39:34.601 --> 39:36.001
right in our face.

39:36.002 --> 39:39.038
In the real world, we've got
a tiny dot 1,200 feet away.

39:39.039 --> 39:40.439
It's a lot harder to see.

39:40.440 --> 39:43.242
So, now we're gonna move
that dot to 500 yards,

39:43.243 --> 39:45.444
give Jamie even more time to react,

39:45.445 --> 39:47.713
and see if he can deliver the goods.

39:47.714 --> 39:49.949
It really is now or never.

39:49.950 --> 39:50.983
There we go.

39:50.984 --> 39:52.985
With 500 yards and 600 milliseconds

39:52.986 --> 39:55.788
to react to the Hollywood blank,

39:55.789 --> 40:00.025
it's time to step up
or get the hell out of dodge.

40:00.026 --> 40:01.894
It's time to call into play those...

40:01.895 --> 40:04.363
<i>catlike</i> hoosier reflexes.

40:05.599 --> 40:08.000
Fire at will.

40:20.413 --> 40:21.780
I dodged it!

40:21.781 --> 40:23.349
Whoo!

40:24.884 --> 40:27.620
At last, at 500 yards,

40:27.621 --> 40:29.855
the Hyneman does his best "Matrix" sway,

40:29.856 --> 40:33.325
and the paintball sails clean past.

40:33.326 --> 40:36.895
But given the status of the
myth, he's not that impressed.

40:36.896 --> 40:41.533
This test showed that I would've
been able to dodge a bullet.

40:41.534 --> 40:42.935
But here's the thing.

40:42.936 --> 40:44.903
We were using Hollywood blanks,

40:44.904 --> 40:46.972
and if we were using real bullets,

40:46.973 --> 40:49.408
I wouldn't have been able to see a thing,

40:49.409 --> 40:50.843
and I would've been dead.

40:50.844 --> 40:52.311
Jamie's right.

40:52.312 --> 40:53.779
You may be able to dodge

40:53.780 --> 40:56.382
an unrealistically bright Hollywood round,

40:56.383 --> 41:00.986
but in the real world, well,
there's only one conclusion.

41:00.987 --> 41:02.221
So, what's the verdict?

41:02.222 --> 41:03.822
The verdict is it's busted.

41:03.823 --> 41:06.325
There is no way you can
dodge a sniper's bullet.

41:06.326 --> 41:08.293
Everything about all their equipment,

41:08.294 --> 41:10.929
including their bullets, is
designed for concealment.

41:10.930 --> 41:13.932
There's just no way you could see
one fire from far enough away

41:13.933 --> 41:16.869
to give you a remote chance
of dodging that thing.

41:16.870 --> 41:17.870
It's busted.

41:17.871 --> 41:20.139
I agree. It's busted.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.440
Let's go.

41:21.441 --> 41:23.909
So, you mind pointing
that thing the other way?

41:26.479 --> 41:27.479
Next...

41:27.480 --> 41:28.981
<i>Adiรณs, muchacho.</i>

41:28.982 --> 41:32.951
...pigs fly, pork drops, and belly flops.

41:32.952 --> 41:35.854
Is water really as hard as pavement?

41:41.316 --> 41:44.485
To find out if water is
as hard as pavement,

41:44.486 --> 41:49.123
Kari, Grant, and Tory have
commenced operation "Pork Drop".

41:49.124 --> 41:50.925
Okay, so, here's the plan.

41:50.926 --> 41:54.095
We've already done drops at 25 and 50 feet.

41:54.096 --> 41:57.231
In the feet-first position, the
"G" load was very far apart.

41:57.232 --> 42:00.134
But in the belly-flop position,
they were much closer.

42:00.135 --> 42:02.436
But just to cover all of our bases,

42:02.437 --> 42:04.305
we're gonna go up to 600 feet,

42:04.306 --> 42:07.775
which will ensure that our pig
reaches terminal velocity.

42:07.776 --> 42:09.443
Tory is gonna get in the helicopter.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.578
When he gets to 600 feet,

42:10.579 --> 42:12.880
he's gonna kick the pig out of the door,

42:12.881 --> 42:16.517
and then we scoop it up
and count the broken bones.

42:16.518 --> 42:20.688
Okay, so, we're at our
target altitude of 600 feet.

42:20.689 --> 42:23.491
We're hovering directly
above the landing zone.

42:23.492 --> 42:24.926
Are you guys ready?

42:24.927 --> 42:26.327
Okay. We're ready.

42:26.328 --> 42:27.728
Okay. Here we go.

42:27.729 --> 42:33.134
Operation "Pork Drop"
onto pavement in 3, 2, 1...

42:38.807 --> 42:40.474
The pig is flying.

42:40.475 --> 42:42.276
Well, he's more falling.

42:42.277 --> 42:44.812
Ohh!

42:46.348 --> 42:48.149
- Oh!
- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho!

42:48.150 --> 42:51.953
Despite a terminal velocity
of 120 miles per hour

42:51.954 --> 42:55.856
and an incredible estimated
"G" load of 5,000-plus,

42:55.857 --> 42:57.425
the bag remained intact

42:57.426 --> 42:59.493
and operation "Pork Drop" was a success.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.896
Now, dropping a pig out of a helicopter

43:01.897 --> 43:03.297
seems pretty straightforward.

43:03.298 --> 43:05.600
That is, unless you have
an uncooperative pig.

43:05.601 --> 43:07.868
But once I got him out of the helicopter,

43:07.869 --> 43:11.072
the drag chute opened up, he got
into the belly-flop position,

43:11.073 --> 43:14.275
and, most importantly, he was
traveling at terminal velocity.

43:14.276 --> 43:16.577
And the best part is, we hit the pavement.

43:17.813 --> 43:20.348
This was a perfect test.

43:20.349 --> 43:22.683
Dude, that was crazy!

43:22.684 --> 43:25.252
Did you hear that splat?

43:25.253 --> 43:27.788
Yeah, and we got a belly flop.

43:32.027 --> 43:36.631
And now to get the thankfully
sealed contents of the bag...

43:36.632 --> 43:38.065
That looked like it hurt.

43:38.066 --> 43:39.967
...over to the X-ray station...

43:39.968 --> 43:42.370
We need to get this pig into X-ray... stat!

43:42.371 --> 43:45.706
...where the technicians
take the shots they need.

43:45.707 --> 43:47.842
But before we assess
and compare the injuries,

43:47.843 --> 43:49.677
it's go for the H2O.

43:49.678 --> 43:52.513
Get in there, piggy.

43:52.514 --> 43:54.515
Okay, for this water test,

43:54.516 --> 43:56.317
we're going to use a pig
of the same weight.

43:56.318 --> 43:58.452
We're gonna go to the same
height with the helicopter

43:58.453 --> 44:00.321
and drop it to get the
same terminal velocity.

44:00.322 --> 44:03.924
God, it's never easy loading
a pig into a helicopter.

44:05.093 --> 44:08.062
We're gonna smack down on the
water in a belly-flop position

44:08.063 --> 44:10.398
and find out if water
is as hard as pavement.

44:10.399 --> 44:13.934
It's operation "Pork Drop", phase two...

44:13.935 --> 44:16.270
<i>a-pork-alypse now</i>.

44:17.739 --> 44:18.973
So, we are set.

44:18.974 --> 44:20.541
We have our pig in the helicopter.

44:20.542 --> 44:22.309
We're gonna take it up to 600 feet,

44:22.310 --> 44:24.145
push it out of the helicopter, onto water.

44:24.146 --> 44:27.548
Now, so far, we have not seen
water behave like pavement,

44:27.549 --> 44:30.251
but we have never dropped
anything from this height.

44:30.252 --> 44:33.120
We might see a similarity here,
but we won't know for sure

44:33.121 --> 44:35.756
until we pull the pig out
of the water, do an X-ray,

44:35.757 --> 44:37.058
and compare the two pigs.

44:37.059 --> 44:38.793
We're all set. You guys ready?

44:38.794 --> 44:41.562
Okay, Tory, we are good to go.

44:41.563 --> 44:46.000
Pork drop number two onto
water at terminal velocity.

44:46.001 --> 44:47.968
<i>Adiรณs, muchacho.</i>

44:50.439 --> 44:51.672
There it goes.

44:51.673 --> 44:54.608
Okay. Stabilizing chute deployed, deployed.

44:54.609 --> 44:56.577
Looking good, looking good!

44:56.578 --> 44:59.880
Belly flop, belly flop, and... oh!

44:59.881 --> 45:01.182
Oh!

45:01.183 --> 45:03.117
Splashdown.

45:03.118 --> 45:05.720
And once again, the
stabilizing chute worked,

45:05.721 --> 45:09.490
serving up the perfect pork belly flop.

45:09.491 --> 45:10.791
So, it didn't sink.

45:10.792 --> 45:14.095
Now to bring home the bacon
and put this myth to bed.

45:14.096 --> 45:16.097
We thought the pig was gonna sink,

45:16.098 --> 45:19.366
so we got a special rescue crew
to go out and dive to get him.

45:19.367 --> 45:22.269
How's the passenger?

45:22.270 --> 45:24.538
But he's actually floating on the water.

45:24.539 --> 45:26.974
Personally, I don't think
they're gonna bring in a pig

45:26.975 --> 45:29.076
that's quite as damaged
as that pavement drop,

45:29.077 --> 45:32.880
though it looked like a really hard hit.

45:32.881 --> 45:35.516
But there's only one way to tell for sure,

45:35.517 --> 45:38.385
and that's a professional medical
assessment of the X-rays

45:38.386 --> 45:41.889
with orthopedic surgeon dr. Halbrecht.

45:43.024 --> 45:44.892
So, did he make it?

45:44.893 --> 45:47.061
How did our pig do on pavement?

45:47.062 --> 45:50.364
Well, the pig on the pavement
did really disastrously.

45:50.365 --> 45:51.799
17 fractures.

45:51.800 --> 45:52.800
Wow.

45:52.801 --> 45:55.202
Here's a femur fracture.

45:55.203 --> 45:57.438
Fracture and dislocation of the spine.

45:57.439 --> 46:00.574
And to top it all off, a decapitation.

46:00.575 --> 46:01.575
Oh!

46:01.576 --> 46:02.943
We got a dislocated head!

46:02.944 --> 46:05.112
So, when we dropped
the pig on the concrete,

46:05.113 --> 46:06.280
it made a sound like...

46:08.216 --> 46:09.950
...a giant popping balloon.

46:11.219 --> 46:14.121
Now, we didn't open the
bag, but we did X-ray it,

46:14.122 --> 46:17.191
and what we found inside were
many, many broken bones

46:17.192 --> 46:19.393
and a pelvis that was so shattered,

46:19.394 --> 46:20.728
it was unrecognizable,

46:20.729 --> 46:23.430
not to mention decapitation.

46:23.431 --> 46:26.867
It's an unsurprising
litany of lethal injuries...

46:26.868 --> 46:29.737
17 clear and catastrophic fractures.

46:29.738 --> 46:32.506
But the key to this myth is the comparison.

46:32.507 --> 46:36.410
All right, so, how did it
compare to the water drop?

46:36.411 --> 46:38.813
The water-drop pig did much better,

46:38.814 --> 46:42.049
although it's still 7
fractures compared to 17.

46:42.050 --> 46:45.419
Six rib fractures and also a neck fracture,

46:45.420 --> 46:48.155
but not as bad as the decapitation.

46:48.156 --> 46:50.591
It couldn't be clearer.

46:50.592 --> 46:54.195
Two pigs of identical weight
falling at the same speed,

46:54.196 --> 46:56.197
landing in the same orientation,

46:56.198 --> 46:59.533
have significantly varied injury diagnoses.

46:59.534 --> 47:02.636
Both the quantity and
quality of the bone breaks

47:02.637 --> 47:05.206
means there can only be one result.

47:05.207 --> 47:08.075
But that's not the only
reason Kari's so happy.

47:08.076 --> 47:10.711
Now, having the clear-cut results

47:10.712 --> 47:14.215
that the pig landing on
the pavement... bam!...

47:14.216 --> 47:17.418
was actually a lot harder than
falling on water was great.

47:17.419 --> 47:19.520
What was even better,

47:19.521 --> 47:22.656
those bags didn't bust open
and I didn't throw up.

47:22.657 --> 47:24.725
So, it turns out pigs don't fly,

47:24.726 --> 47:27.228
but they do fall, and they land hard.

47:27.229 --> 47:30.598
However, as far as this myth is concerned,

47:30.599 --> 47:33.067
if you're hitting the water at any height,

47:33.068 --> 47:35.536
it's not gonna be as hard as
if you're hitting pavement.

47:35.537 --> 47:36.537
So this myth is busted.

47:36.538 --> 47:38.105
Myth is busted.

47:38.106 --> 47:40.107
I think we're gonna have
to call this one busted.

47:40.108 --> 47:41.642
How come we don't have a helicopter

47:41.643 --> 47:44.144
to fly home after <i>every</i> myth?
