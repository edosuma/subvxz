00:01.000 --> 00:03.241
<i>Previously on Broadchurch...</i>

00:03.400 --> 00:04.890
<i>There were two girls.</i>

00:05.040 --> 00:09.284
<i>Lisa Newbery, 19, was babysitting
for her 12-year-old cousin, Pippa.</i>

00:10.760 --> 00:13.491
<i>Pippa's parents went away for the night
to a friend's wedding.</i>

00:13.640 --> 00:16.450
<i>When they came back the next day,
both girls were gone.</i>

00:18.560 --> 00:21.484
<i>Pippa, the 12-year-old,
she was found three days later.</i>

00:22.160 --> 00:25.687
<i>Lisa... Officially, she's still missing.</i>

00:27.040 --> 00:29.646
<i>Our main suspect
was a man called Lee Ashworth.</i>

00:29.800 --> 00:31.529
<i>But he had a solid alibi.</i>

00:31.680 --> 00:33.045
Lee's my husband.

00:33.200 --> 00:38.127
<i>You have to be satisfied
that you are sure of the defendant's guilt.</i>

00:38.280 --> 00:41.568
<i>You are the judges of fact.</i>

00:41.720 --> 00:43.529
<i>You must put aside any emotion</i>

00:43.680 --> 00:46.809
<i>and approach this in a cold, analytical way.</i>

00:46.960 --> 00:48.769
They're saying I might be the killer.

00:48.920 --> 00:51.730
You're saying Pippa's pendant
actually belonged to Claire?

00:51.880 --> 00:53.723
You took this?

00:54.440 --> 00:56.363
You had this all along?

00:56.520 --> 00:59.205
There's a verdict.
The jury are coming back in.

01:06.600 --> 01:09.649
- Have you reached a verdict on this defendant?
- Yes.

01:09.800 --> 01:12.326
Is this the verdict of you all,
or as a majority?

01:12.480 --> 01:13.845
A majority.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.125
Will the defendant please stand.

01:23.240 --> 01:26.483
Do you find the defendant,
Joseph Michael Miller,

01:26.640 --> 01:28.802
guilty or not guilty?

01:34.640 --> 01:37.041
Not guilty.

01:46.480 --> 01:50.485
Mr Miller, you have been found not guilty.

01:51.160 --> 01:53.162
You're free to leave the dock.

01:56.720 --> 01:58.290
Thank you, my lady.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.003
Members of the jury,

02:02.160 --> 02:04.640
thank you for your careful attention to the facts

02:04.800 --> 02:06.723
and for delivering your verdict.

02:06.880 --> 02:09.690
You have discharged your duties honourably.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.882
This has been...

02:17.880 --> 02:22.363
This has been an extremely difficult
and distressing case,

02:23.040 --> 02:27.045
and as such, this court excuses you all
from any future jury duty.

02:28.480 --> 02:30.403
Thank you.

02:30.560 --> 02:31.721
You OK?

02:31.880 --> 02:33.291
Claire Ripley, I'm arresting you

02:33.440 --> 02:36.364
on suspicion of the murder of
Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.

02:36.520 --> 02:38.204
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

02:38.360 --> 02:39.850
- if you don't mention...
- All rise.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.604
...which you later rely on in court.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.923
Anything you do say may be given in evidence.
Do you understand?

02:45.080 --> 02:46.684
Right, go.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.288
Argh!

03:15.840 --> 03:18.810
- How is that justice?
- It's not.

03:19.840 --> 03:21.842
Go and be with your family.

03:22.560 --> 03:24.722
I want to kill him, Ell.

03:24.880 --> 03:26.530
I know.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.682
Me too.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.442
Come with me. Come on.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.684
What does it take to destroy lives forever?
12 people.

03:41.840 --> 03:45.561
12 ordinary, stupid, easily-swayed,
hard-of-thinking arseholes.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.449
Alec, I'm so sorry.

03:47.600 --> 03:50.604
I arrested this woman at 2:32pm.
She is aware she's under caution.

03:50.760 --> 03:53.411
I need you to take her to the nick.
Sort out an interview room?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.689
Yeah, I rang the custody suite at Broadchurch.
I'll sit in with you.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.888
No, no. I need Miller.

03:59.040 --> 04:02.123
- Yeah. Course you do.
- Claire just handed me this pendant.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.521
You two should have plenty to talk about.

04:09.960 --> 04:14.409
- Any restrictions on where he can go?
- Not now that he's been found not guilty.

04:14.560 --> 04:16.608
How do we get him back in court?

04:16.760 --> 04:19.206
He killed Danny
and he's got off by playing the system.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.726
You can't appeal
once someone has been acquitted,

04:21.880 --> 04:24.326
unless compelling new evidence
comes forward.

04:24.480 --> 04:26.562
- I don't believe this.
- So this is what happens.

04:26.720 --> 04:29.564
Our lives get put through hell,
and a guilty man walks free.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.768
Mark, I'm... I'm so sorry.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.883
- Where do you think Dad's gonna go?
- Don't worry, you'll be safe.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.771
I've asked one of the uniform lads
to swing by Lucy's,

04:39.920 --> 04:41.331
just in case he comes over.

04:41.480 --> 04:45.041
- Has he still got keys to your place?
- I changed the locks months ago.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.202
We'll get through this. OK?

04:51.640 --> 04:53.642
It's gonna be all right, Mum.

04:56.280 --> 04:58.681
How are the family taking it?

04:58.840 --> 05:01.446
Maybe you should've asked that
before you took on the case.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.602
Oh, please don't be a sore loser.

05:03.760 --> 05:05.205
And don't be a shitty winner!

05:05.360 --> 05:07.249
I trained you so much better than this.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.291
All the people you could've helped,
and you take on a tawdry child killer.

05:11.440 --> 05:14.046
All I ever wanted
was for you to prove me wrong,

05:14.200 --> 05:16.009
and show the world how brilliant you were.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.288
No, you wanted a mini you.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.363
You know the difference between us?

05:21.160 --> 05:23.128
I don't see the nobility in this job.

05:23.280 --> 05:27.285
I see a loaded, lopsided game...

05:27.440 --> 05:31.206
full of people justifying their cynicism
as a higher calling.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.601
It's street-fighting in wigs. That's all.

05:34.680 --> 05:38.526
There are wins that help you sleep at night...
others that keep you awake.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.281
I'd stock up on the sleeping pills.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.048
Right, Miller, listen to me.

05:50.720 --> 05:52.802
See that anger you're feeling? That rage?

05:52.960 --> 05:56.681
That's how I woke up every day for the past
two years, knowing Lee Ashworth got off.

05:56.840 --> 06:00.367
- Don't try and tell me I should try and let it go.
- Oh, I don't want you to let it go.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.171
I want you to stoke it.
I want it to burn in you, like it does in me.

06:03.320 --> 06:05.209
I need someone as angry as me right now.

06:05.360 --> 06:09.524
Cos we're gonna close the case
on Claire and Lee Ashworth, today. Together.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.729
- After today, if you think I'm gonna go with you...
- Yeah, I do.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.325
You can't change what happened,

06:14.480 --> 06:16.801
but you can make sure
another killer goes down.

06:16.960 --> 06:19.440
That fury is fuel.
Do something with it.

06:20.280 --> 06:24.569
The pendant is the lever to get them to confess.
We're gonna go in hard on them.

06:24.720 --> 06:27.849
Let's work that verdict off
on two very deserving people.

06:35.720 --> 06:45.720
<b><font color=#004F8C>Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

07:01.600 --> 07:04.126
- Yeah?
- Claire's in custody.

07:04.280 --> 07:09.081
We've reason to believe she has a piece
of evidence relating to Lisa and Pippa's deaths.

07:09.240 --> 07:12.244
- What evidence?
- I can't talk. I'm heading over there now.

07:12.400 --> 07:14.448
Erm, she turned down a solicitor.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.922
She came to me.
Said she wanted us to know the truth now.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.321
You haven't had a falling out, have you?

07:23.760 --> 07:25.649
<i>Just do me a favour.
Don't leave the area.</i>

07:25.800 --> 07:28.121
I'm sure I'll want to talk to you very soon.

07:45.360 --> 07:47.362
You ready?

07:57.920 --> 08:00.400
- It was Joe.
- No.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.326
Time to stop playing games.

08:37.520 --> 08:39.328
I need your help.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.203
No.

08:42.840 --> 08:44.968
I've been found innocent.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.287
You have to help me come home.

08:50.560 --> 08:54.406
Tell me how you came to have
Pippa Gillespie's pendant, Claire.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.927
Have you arrested Lee yet?

08:57.080 --> 08:59.048
Is that what this is about?

08:59.200 --> 09:02.841
You brought us the pendant
as a way of sending a message to Lee?

09:04.960 --> 09:07.486
Why did you tell my husband I was pregnant...

09:08.960 --> 09:11.691
...or that I'd had an abortion,
when I told you in confidence?

09:11.840 --> 09:13.842
That's a breach of trust.

09:14.000 --> 09:15.490
You wanna talk about trust?

09:15.640 --> 09:19.770
You want to talk about how the Gillespies
trusted you to take their daughter to school?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.604
What did you do on those journeys?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.762
Start grooming her for Lee? Was that it?

09:25.040 --> 09:27.520
Why did you force me
to have sex with you, Alec?

09:27.680 --> 09:29.489
We have never had sex, Claire.

09:29.640 --> 09:32.120
Why have you been holding me
against my will, Alec?

09:33.000 --> 09:34.365
Is there any truth to this?

09:34.520 --> 09:37.171
Of course there bloody isn't.
You asked me to help you,

09:37.320 --> 09:40.244
because you were worried
that your husband would come after you.

09:40.400 --> 09:42.084
You hurt me physically, Alec.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.084
You were sad because your wife had
another man's cock in her mouth,

09:45.240 --> 09:48.608
but you shouldn't have held me prisoner
and forced me to have sex with you.

09:48.760 --> 09:50.967
- I need to stop the interview.
- Don't touch that.

09:51.120 --> 09:54.488
- I have to take these allegations seriously...
- Sit down, Miller!

09:54.640 --> 09:57.723
You want to keep going with these allegations?
Fill your boots. GO on.

09:57.880 --> 10:01.771
We'll stop now,
you can report those offences, I'll be arrested.

10:02.480 --> 10:04.209
You want that? We can do that.

10:05.360 --> 10:07.169
Say the word.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.926
But that's not why you're here, is it?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.689
You're here because of Lee.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.007
So what are you thinking?

10:26.920 --> 10:29.730
We bring Lee in, he gets a fright seeing that...

10:32.640 --> 10:34.881
...and then, instead of betraying you...

10:35.960 --> 10:39.885
...you're banking on him realising
he needs to stay close to you...

10:40.800 --> 10:42.689
...because of what you know.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.209
I don't know anything.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.089
I don't.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.881
You know what happened
to Lisa Newbery and Pippa Gillespie.

10:51.840 --> 10:54.047
- You're wrong.
- I don't think I am.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.690
Not when I look in your eyes.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.570
I'm not scared of you, Alec.

10:59.720 --> 11:01.768
Yeah, well, you should be.

11:04.920 --> 11:08.447
Why have you got Ricky Gillespie's
office number in the mobile DI Hardy gave you?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.841
Oh, hello, you're piping up now, are you?

11:11.000 --> 11:14.527
Had a little peek at my phone, did you?
Thank you for that. Mate!

11:14.680 --> 11:17.126
Why would you be calling Pippa's dad?

11:18.480 --> 11:21.211
Did Ricky send you the bluebell?

11:22.520 --> 11:24.602
Oh, he did!

11:26.400 --> 11:28.926
Why's Ricky got a picture of bluebells
on his office wall?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.003
Has he?

11:31.840 --> 11:34.650
- What happened that night, Claire?
- Don't know.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.570
- You're kidding me.
- Shh.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.002
He can't be here.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.848
He said it's the only place he can go.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.401
No, I mean he can't come back to this town.

11:54.560 --> 11:56.483
Well, I've told him that.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.322
So what did you call me for?

12:00.000 --> 12:03.243
Because I need to tell someone else
what I'm gonna do.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.561
How are we meant to survive this?

12:11.200 --> 12:13.965
I know what we have to do.
I just don't know how we do it.

12:14.120 --> 12:16.009
What do you mean?

12:16.160 --> 12:19.881
If the system won't give us justice,
then we have to do it ourselves.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.041
- I'm gonna break her in there.
- You're too emotionally wound up.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.565
Me?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.722
Have you ever met yourself?

12:34.080 --> 12:37.163
I will do whatever it takes
to get those two in prison.

12:39.560 --> 12:41.403
Stop fiddling with that.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.642
Something is bugging me.

12:45.240 --> 12:46.730
What?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.447
Oh, perfect. Stay there. OK.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.206
I need someone to go to Lee and Claire's
and get a photograph.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.727
All right, talk to Tess.
I've got to do something.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.249
Come on! Where is it?

13:13.400 --> 13:15.607
Where's what, Lee?

13:15.760 --> 13:17.922
Before I called you,
I had someone following you.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.730
Lee Ashworth, I'm arresting you

13:19.880 --> 13:23.441
in connection with the murders of
Pippa Gillespie and Lisa Newbery.

13:34.960 --> 13:36.962
Paul?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.641
Paul?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.284
Mark...

13:56.320 --> 13:57.970
Paul!

14:00.440 --> 14:02.442
Paul!

14:02.680 --> 14:04.921
Help! Help!

14:15.880 --> 14:17.245
Yeah, course I'm happy.

14:17.400 --> 14:19.482
Just want to go home.

14:21.840 --> 14:23.968
Yeah, I've got to go.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.408
- I brought gin.
- Go away.

14:53.680 --> 14:55.682
I can take a loss.
But this one mattered.

14:55.840 --> 14:57.842
Now the whole town knows I failed.

14:59.320 --> 15:00.685
It hurts.

15:00.840 --> 15:02.968
Yes, well, life does.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.928
I never said being back in the world
would be painless.

15:08.960 --> 15:12.123
I want to make it right for them, Maggie,
and I can't.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.044
No.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.123
None of us can now.

15:21.800 --> 15:24.167
Do you think they'll be strong enough?

15:32.280 --> 15:34.328
This what you were after?

15:35.160 --> 15:37.367
- That was quick!
- I'm really good.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.410
Yes, look. See, there it is.
That and that.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.131
Which also makes sense of these two receipts.

15:43.880 --> 15:46.167
Oh, Miller, that is outstanding!

15:51.240 --> 15:54.687
So, I found this at the bottom
of the old case files.

15:54.840 --> 15:56.888
What was it for?

16:00.520 --> 16:04.161
Stock for a job I was doing
the following Monday. Oak boards.

16:05.040 --> 16:09.364
So you bought this Saturday morning,
the exact amount, everything you needed?

16:09.520 --> 16:11.841
Yeah. And then I done the job on Monday.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.968
Yeah, I know, I checked.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.566
So, why did you go back
to the same supply yard,

16:16.720 --> 16:20.008
first thing Monday morning,
and buy the exact same stock again?

16:20.680 --> 16:22.967
What?

16:23.120 --> 16:24.724
A second, identical purchase.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.725
Nobody thought to query it.
Obviously, I'm a bit more fussy.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.928
What happened to the stuff
bought on Saturday?

16:31.080 --> 16:33.208
Why did you have to buy it all over again?

16:35.200 --> 16:37.407
I didn't get enough.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.724
This was taken a week before,
just as you were installing your own floor.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.282
Those boards are not the same boards
that are down on that floor now, Lee.

16:48.440 --> 16:52.764
<i>Those are dark oak floorboards.
What's down there now is light oak.</i>

16:52.920 --> 16:56.447
The same light oak boards you bought
Saturday morning and again Monday morning.

16:56.600 --> 17:00.491
What did you use those boards for, Lee,
between Saturday and Monday?

17:03.320 --> 17:04.890
What happened on the floor, Lee?

17:08.480 --> 17:09.527
Nothing.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.682
No, something did.

17:13.960 --> 17:16.645
What were you looking for at the cottage, Lee?

17:19.000 --> 17:20.684
Is this what you were looking for?

17:20.839 --> 17:25.607
For the tape, DI Hardy is showing Mr Ashworth
a clear plastic evidence bag - AH/1 -

17:25.760 --> 17:27.648
containing a pendant.

17:31.400 --> 17:32.765
Where did you get it from?

17:32.920 --> 17:35.161
- From your wife.
- What?

17:35.320 --> 17:41.168
This is the evidence that proves Pippa Gillespie
was in your car the night she died.

17:42.480 --> 17:45.962
This is the missing evidence
that nearly killed me.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.688
And now I've got it.

17:51.400 --> 17:54.290
You know what I think this was?
Her insurance policy.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.488
She didn't trust you.

17:58.920 --> 18:01.685
Just like you never should've trusted her.

18:02.680 --> 18:04.409
She has stitched you up.

18:08.160 --> 18:10.640
And she never told you about the baby.

18:12.760 --> 18:17.163
I get it. When you're in love,
you think you're gonna be interlocked forever.

18:17.920 --> 18:20.491
Love's all-encompassing
when you're in it, but...

18:21.840 --> 18:23.569
...really, you can't trust anyone.

18:24.240 --> 18:26.288
Not even the people you love.

18:27.440 --> 18:31.047
Ultimately...we're all alone.

18:34.560 --> 18:36.767
You more than anyone right now.

18:38.680 --> 18:41.968
So set the record straight
and we can all get released from this.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.646
Come on, you must be so tired of lying.

18:44.800 --> 18:47.041
No-one's coming to your rescue.
You're on your own.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.168
This is it. Last chance.

18:49.320 --> 18:51.641
Did you kill Lisa Newbery?

19:00.160 --> 19:01.844
Why won't he leave me alone?

19:03.720 --> 19:05.404
- Where's Pippa?
- She's asleep.

19:05.560 --> 19:09.121
- I should probably get back to her.
- No, go get her, bring her over.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.487
You can both stay here till he's gone.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.130
I was just walking past.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.362
Do you have to be such a wanker?

19:24.520 --> 19:27.091
- Oh! Shit!
- Get back to burning your animals!

19:27.240 --> 19:29.607
- Argh!
- Oh, get off me! Look at that!

19:30.880 --> 19:32.245
You punched me.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.641
Final warning.
Stay away from her.

19:35.480 --> 19:38.609
- But I love her.
- Get over it, or I'll break your leg.

19:39.400 --> 19:40.890
Go on. Jog on.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.089
You hit him?

19:48.240 --> 19:50.766
Yeah, well, it's quicker than talking.

19:50.920 --> 19:53.526
He did get a bit of a nosebleed, though,
poor sod.

19:53.680 --> 19:55.921
You got blood on your shirt.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.251
Yeah.

20:04.080 --> 20:07.527
- Where's Pippa?
- She's asleep in your bed. She barely woke up.

20:14.240 --> 20:16.322
You had sex with Lisa Newbery that night?

20:16.480 --> 20:18.801
All this time you've been denying it.

20:20.040 --> 20:22.042
Then what?

20:24.720 --> 20:27.041
You killed her?

20:27.600 --> 20:29.648
No. Claire.

20:31.680 --> 20:33.250
You don't have a clue.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.322
Ricky came home from the wedding?

20:46.960 --> 20:48.450
- Get your clothes on!
- Calm down!

20:48.600 --> 20:50.011
- Where's Pippa?
- Upstairs.

20:50.160 --> 20:52.322
- We trusted you to look after her!
- Lee was helping me.

20:52.480 --> 20:54.244
That's shit. I've been out there 15 minutes.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.084
- You've been watching us?
- I've seen...

20:56.240 --> 20:57.605
- You dirty old bastard!
- Lisa!

20:57.760 --> 21:00.081
- What did you call me?
- You're pissed. Just calm down.

21:00.240 --> 21:01.969
- I've seen you looking...
- What?

21:02.120 --> 21:05.329
You're just pissed off
that I fucked him instead of you.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.608
- Is that how you talk to me?
- Stop it!

21:07.760 --> 21:10.764
- No! Get off me!
- Call me a bastard again!

21:17.880 --> 21:19.689
Where was Claire?

21:24.840 --> 21:28.242
This little box...contains Lee's taped evidence.

21:29.760 --> 21:31.125
You are lying, Claire.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.408
You've lied and changed your story
a dozen times,

21:33.560 --> 21:35.130
and blamed everyone but yourself.

21:35.280 --> 21:37.044
Well, now it's time to tell the truth.

21:37.200 --> 21:40.443
Lee's told us Ricky killed Lisa.
But what happened to Pippa?

21:43.280 --> 21:44.770
It's me! You here?

21:47.040 --> 21:48.804
Hey.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.167
What are you doing here, sweetheart?

21:53.640 --> 21:56.291
- What's wrong?
- I think there's been an accident.

21:56.440 --> 21:59.444
- What do you mean...?
- Hey, Pippa, you should be asleep.

21:59.600 --> 22:01.887
- I thought you were at a wedding.
- ls Lisa all right?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.088
No, no, no, baby, she's not. She's...

22:04.240 --> 22:06.368
- I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.
- What?

22:06.520 --> 22:08.204
What?

22:09.640 --> 22:11.688
No. You shouldn't be here.

22:21.800 --> 22:24.201
Claire, I need you to go to Pippa and sit with her.

22:24.360 --> 22:27.523
I've told her you'll bring her some medicine
to calm her down. Here.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.081
Claire. Claire.
Give her some of that.

22:30.240 --> 22:32.641
It'll help her sleep.
I'll deal with her in the morning.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.041
- Claire's not part of this...
- Shut up.

22:35.200 --> 22:39.285
You're all over her body. You're inside her.
Her blood's on your floor.

22:39.440 --> 22:42.091
I'll go and get the van.
You clean up in here.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.731
You go to the police,
and I'll put it all on you.

22:57.400 --> 23:00.722
Claire. You can't give her that.
You can't give Pippa that.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.885
He told me that when he goes out
to bars and clubs he puts Rohypnol in there.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.489
- We've gotta go to the police.
- Did you have sex with her'?

23:11.600 --> 23:13.170
Did you have sex with her, Lee?

23:15.440 --> 23:17.522
What have you done?

23:30.160 --> 23:31.730
Come here.

23:34.360 --> 23:37.170
How long were you sitting on the stairs? Hm?

23:38.520 --> 23:42.570
Come on... It's all right.
I won't tell anyone, I promise.

23:42.720 --> 23:44.722
Had you been there long?

23:45.680 --> 23:47.444
Yeah?

23:48.120 --> 23:50.521
Was the door open?

23:52.520 --> 23:54.727
But you heard something?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.921
- I heard Lisa and Lee.
- Oh.

24:01.840 --> 24:04.047
They were having sex.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.002
And then I heard the fight.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.764
OK.

24:12.040 --> 24:15.044
OK. Thank you
for telling me the truth, sweetheart.

24:16.680 --> 24:18.444
Lee hurt Lisa. My dad said.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.807
It's all right. It's all right. Hey.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.169
Thank you for being honest.
You've done really well.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.327
Now, I don't want you to worry.

24:32.480 --> 24:34.687
You just need to rest.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.168
Your dad has left you something.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.405
Bit of medicine just to...calm you down...

24:47.960 --> 24:50.850
...help you sleep,
while we get all this sorted out.

24:51.480 --> 24:54.131
I want you to take a big gulp of that.

24:54.280 --> 24:56.203
A big gulp of that.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.362
That's a good girl.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.602
Well done.

25:00.760 --> 25:03.240
- I don't like it.
- No, it's horrible, isn't it?

25:04.280 --> 25:06.521
Medicine always is.

25:09.840 --> 25:11.524
But it's gonna help everything.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.802
Snuggle down now.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.002
Come on, snuggle down.

25:26.040 --> 25:28.042
Snug as a bug.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.602
I'm just downstairs.

25:37.920 --> 25:39.763
I'm worried about Lisa.

25:42.360 --> 25:44.203
Everything's gonna be all right.

26:00.800 --> 26:03.201
We've got to clear this mess up.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.127
Pippa heard you having sex.

26:08.280 --> 26:10.408
She thinks you killed Lisa.

26:18.960 --> 26:21.088
Did you give her that stuff from the flask?

26:25.640 --> 26:27.768
She'll be asleep now.

27:45.480 --> 27:46.925
What are you doing? Where's Pippa?

27:47.080 --> 27:49.890
Look, I'll explain.
We haven't got much time. Just drive.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.247
Just drive!

28:14.240 --> 28:16.607
- You need to...
- Claire! What are we doing here?

28:16.760 --> 28:18.967
Where's Pippa?
Claire, you tell me where she is!

28:19.120 --> 28:20.804
Stop. Stop!

28:20.960 --> 28:23.167
- Where is Pippa?
- You need to stay calm. Right?

28:23.320 --> 28:25.607
I gave her the stuff from your flask, like you said.

28:25.760 --> 28:28.127
- Right?
- What was in there? Not just whisky, was it?

28:31.200 --> 28:32.964
- What happened?
- She had a reaction.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.248
She said she couldn't breathe.
She was choking.

28:35.400 --> 28:39.405
- It was... It was just... It was just so, so fast.
- What are you telling me?

28:39.560 --> 28:43.246
We couldn't call an ambulance, Ricky,
not with Lisa's blood all over the floor.

28:46.440 --> 28:48.283
We...couldn't save her.

28:51.560 --> 28:53.483
She's gone.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.369
No.

28:56.840 --> 28:58.683
- No.
- I'm so sorry.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.888
No, don't say that. Don't say that.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.601
OK, Lee said he knows somewhere...
somewhere peaceful, where you used to go,

29:04.760 --> 29:06.569
somewhere she won't be found for a while.

29:06.720 --> 29:09.883
That's why we're here. OK?
You can go and look and I'll wait here.

29:10.040 --> 29:11.530
I'll wait here.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.322
I'll wait here.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.565
Ricky.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.722
Give me the keys.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.602
Listen. I've got to tell you this.

30:13.280 --> 30:15.203
I've buried your hip flask in the woods here.

30:15.360 --> 30:19.081
I know exactly where,
but nobody else will be able to find it.

30:19.240 --> 30:22.210
If you feel you want to talk to the police,
or you blame us for this,

30:22.360 --> 30:24.442
remember, I know where your hip flask is

30:24.600 --> 30:27.046
that contains traces that's killed Pippa.

30:28.160 --> 30:30.561
It's just a precaution.
That's all. Nothing else.

30:32.040 --> 30:34.441
You've thought it all through, haven't you?

30:35.840 --> 30:37.888
I've got to think of the future.

31:06.120 --> 31:09.727
I only came home that night
to tell him I was pregnant.

31:23.120 --> 31:25.851
We've got a pretty clear picture
of the events of that night.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.128
But we want to hear it from you.

31:28.280 --> 31:31.727
We know you killed Lisa.
But where did you bury her body?

31:31.880 --> 31:35.089
- No comment.
- No, no, no, no, don't do that.

31:35.240 --> 31:37.049
Cate broke your alibi weeks ago.

31:37.680 --> 31:40.081
There were hours
when she didn't see you at the wedding.

31:40.240 --> 31:44.086
She assumed you were off
sleeping with a bridesmaid - Tiffany Evans.

31:44.240 --> 31:46.288
But we spoke to Tiffany.
She said otherwise.

31:46.440 --> 31:50.240
And I did a lot - and I do mean a lot - of checking
with every cab company in your area.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.890
Unfortunately, for you,

31:52.040 --> 31:55.806
the cab company that took you home that night
have got a computerised system.

31:55.960 --> 31:58.122
They keep really good records.

32:01.120 --> 32:03.122
Your journey details. Times.

32:03.280 --> 32:04.805
All paid up.

32:05.560 --> 32:07.722
- No comment.
- Seriously?

32:09.080 --> 32:11.651
My daughter was the same age as Pippa
when this happened.

32:12.240 --> 32:14.766
My heart went out to you.
I knew how you felt.

32:15.440 --> 32:17.920
I couldn't let you down.
That's what I always thought.

32:19.520 --> 32:22.763
Two years, never letting go -
I nearly killed myself over this -

32:22.920 --> 32:24.684
and you're gonna "no comment" me?

32:28.160 --> 32:30.766
So is there anything else you want to say to us?

32:45.480 --> 32:47.881
I got my punishment that night.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.327
What did you do with Lisa's body?

32:53.160 --> 32:55.083
<i>Lee was working at a church.</i>

32:55.240 --> 32:57.527
<i>There was a funeral the day before, so...</i>

32:59.680 --> 33:01.250
<i>...best place to hide a body...</i>

33:03.360 --> 33:05.010
...a grave.

34:30.239 --> 34:33.527
Did you not find any traces of Rohypnol
in Pippa's body?

34:34.320 --> 34:38.210
Passes through the system in 24 hours.
We didn't find her for a few days.

34:38.880 --> 34:40.962
Besides, the water had...

34:42.080 --> 34:44.525
You did it. You got them.

34:47.840 --> 34:50.241
Done my penance.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.686
I just keep thinking of all the damage done.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.042
All those lives.

35:08.200 --> 35:09.565
That's Beth. She's here.

35:09.720 --> 35:12.644
- Do you mind if I...
- No, go. We're done. Go on.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.764
I think you're wrong, by the way.

35:19.920 --> 35:21.968
You're wrong.
What you said to Lee in there.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.168
We're not all alone.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.402
I hope you're right, Miller.

35:47.840 --> 35:51.003
- I wasn't sure you'd come.
- I can't believe you asked.

35:51.160 --> 35:54.050
Anyway, I never miss a chance to be belittled.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.331
- I want to work with you.
- You want to what?

35:57.480 --> 36:01.087
I'm not ready to stop.
In fact, I'm just getting going again.

36:01.240 --> 36:02.924
You don't want to end on a loss.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.686
No, I bloody don't - and especially not to you.

36:06.800 --> 36:09.690
Why would I ever want to work with you again?

36:10.720 --> 36:15.965
Because I bring prestige, which matters...
Don't protest.

36:17.640 --> 36:21.645
I'm brilliant. I'd be your conscience...
challenge what you do -

36:21.800 --> 36:23.928
and I still think you need that.

36:25.040 --> 36:28.123
I think you're wrong about the law...
and I understand why.

36:28.280 --> 36:30.760
But it is a calling. It... It is noble.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.685
And I think you need to get that back.

36:34.840 --> 36:37.525
- I don't need a tutor.
- Yes, you do. We all do.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.603
It wouldn't work.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.842
I'm sorry, but no.

36:42.600 --> 36:44.648
I've done some work on this.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.962
They're wrong about your son's case.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.610
I think there could be grounds for appeal.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.964
Where did you get these files?

36:57.120 --> 36:59.168
They're the originals you sent me.

37:00.080 --> 37:03.721
And you kept them,
even though you don't like me very much?

37:03.880 --> 37:06.042
I don't have to like you.

37:06.760 --> 37:08.842
But I have to believe in you.

37:11.040 --> 37:14.010
I've spent too much time here recently
being afraid.

37:14.160 --> 37:16.242
I need a way back in.

37:23.720 --> 37:25.449
Get out.

37:27.040 --> 37:28.963
- No! No, not here!
- What's the matter, Joe?

37:29.120 --> 37:31.805
You worried about
what could happen up there? Get out!

37:33.760 --> 37:35.922
Mark, what are you gonna do to me?

37:36.080 --> 37:37.570
Please don't.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.090
No.

37:44.080 --> 37:46.128
I trusted you.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.291
Oh, God.

37:59.560 --> 38:01.449
- Sit down.
- Beth...

38:01.600 --> 38:03.602
Sit down!

38:15.560 --> 38:18.370
Do you know how many knives
there are in here?

38:18.520 --> 38:20.124
14.

38:21.920 --> 38:24.082
I counted them while I was waiting.

38:26.480 --> 38:28.926
- Thought which'd be best to use on you.
- I'm sorry...

38:29.080 --> 38:31.811
No, no, no. Don't open your mouth.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.042
You don't get to speak.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.643
You could've kept...

38:42.400 --> 38:44.448
...one bit of your humanity.

38:46.560 --> 38:49.530
You could've faced up to what you've done...

38:50.520 --> 38:52.682
...taken your punishment...

38:53.760 --> 38:56.923
...been a decent human being.

38:57.720 --> 38:59.210
What...

38:59.920 --> 39:01.968
What am I saying?

39:03.200 --> 39:05.885
You're not that.
You can't ever have been.

39:09.120 --> 39:11.122
When you die...

39:12.000 --> 39:14.162
...no-one will mourn for you.

39:17.880 --> 39:19.848
We could kill you in here...

39:20.000 --> 39:22.128
dump your body on a beach...

39:25.800 --> 39:27.564
No-one would care.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.402
No-one would notice.

39:32.320 --> 39:34.322
But we're more than you. We will...

39:34.480 --> 39:36.721
<i>I</i> will not be broken by this.

39:37.600 --> 39:39.762
We all get to live.

39:41.240 --> 39:43.242
But you...

39:43.920 --> 39:46.048
...you've no life left.

39:46.960 --> 39:49.964
- Not here.
- I was found innocent...

39:50.120 --> 39:52.964
Shut up! Just shut up, you piece of shit!

39:53.120 --> 39:55.441
- I'm sorry, Ell.
- You're not sorry!

39:56.560 --> 39:59.040
If you were sorry, you'd have pleaded guilty.

40:00.320 --> 40:03.688
You heard what she said. You are leaving
and you are never coming back.

40:03.840 --> 40:07.287
And you will never see
either of your children again.

40:10.120 --> 40:12.361
- You can't do that.
- Oh, I can do that.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.201
If you try and see them, if you follow them,

40:16.360 --> 40:20.922
if you go to their schools,
if you contact them in any way, I will kill you.

40:23.520 --> 40:26.490
And, unlike you, I will face the consequences.

40:30.120 --> 40:32.282
You are dead to us.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.681
Do you understand?

40:37.680 --> 40:39.921
Now, you're coming with us.

40:52.160 --> 40:54.447
Your bags are in the cab.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.807
It'll take you to Bournemouth train station.

40:59.760 --> 41:02.889
A vicar friend of mine will make sure
you get on the train to Sheffield.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.849
I've got you into a halfway house.

41:05.640 --> 41:09.167
From there...you're on your own.

41:48.520 --> 41:51.569
- You think you can banish me?
- We're sure of it, Joe.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.442
What time's your taxi coming?

42:34.600 --> 42:36.250
Erm...about half an hour.

42:36.400 --> 42:38.402
- You don't have to wait.
- Right.

42:49.440 --> 42:53.126
- Miller, I couldn't have done this without you.
- No, you couldn't. And you didn't.

42:53.280 --> 42:55.248
- Seriously.
- Don't be nice to me.

42:55.400 --> 42:57.846
- That's not how it works.
- I...

42:59.000 --> 43:00.923
So where are you gonna go?

43:01.080 --> 43:03.082
Uh...I don't know. Erm...

43:03.800 --> 43:05.768
Close to Daisy.
I need to be near my daughter.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.365
Yeah. Quite right.

43:09.280 --> 43:10.884
Well...

43:11.040 --> 43:13.088
OK, thanks for everything.

43:13.760 --> 43:15.285
A handshake?

43:15.440 --> 43:17.647
Yeah, not hugging you.

43:19.880 --> 43:21.370
Look after yourself, Miller.

43:25.760 --> 43:27.250
What about Joe?

43:28.080 --> 43:30.208
It's been dealt with.

43:51.800 --> 43:55.088
- I miss him so much.
- Me too.

43:58.800 --> 44:01.565
We haven't shown you this place,
have we?

44:02.720 --> 44:05.849
And we can't never come here.
We can't miss out.

44:06.720 --> 44:08.848
Not on somewhere this beautiful.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.648
We lost your brother here, darlin'.

44:13.880 --> 44:15.370
He would've loved you.

44:16.720 --> 44:19.963
He would've loved having
a little sister to boss around.

44:23.360 --> 44:25.761
We have to reclaim it for you now, Lizzie.

44:27.960 --> 44:30.008
And for us.

44:30.160 --> 44:32.447
Keep our love as strong as steel.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.641
That's the way we win.

44:46.920 --> 44:49.002
- Heya.
- Hey! You're late.

44:49.160 --> 44:51.561
Yeah, but we've got crisps!

44:51.720 --> 44:54.121
- Hello!
- Hello, Fred!

44:54.720 --> 44:56.609
Yeah, he likes that, doesn't he?

44:56.760 --> 44:58.125
He's a cutie, isn't he?

44:58.280 --> 44:59.611
- Hello.
- How are you doing?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.922
- All right.
- Hi, pretty girl.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.208
- She's got a little red nose!
- Oh.

45:07.360 --> 45:08.521
- Hello, darling.
- Hello!

45:08.680 --> 45:10.330
- How you doing?
- All right. Hello!

45:10.480 --> 45:12.084
Are you saying hello to everybody?

45:12.640 --> 45:14.642
Yeah.

46:00.720 --> 46:02.722
Where to, then, sir?
