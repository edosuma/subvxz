02:16.428 --> 02:18.639
These are delicious.
I'll give you some.

03:30.294 --> 03:32.462
This is a bracelet of hope.

03:33.338 --> 03:34.715
Thank you!

06:17.169 --> 06:19.379
Kagome kagome

06:20.547 --> 06:24.218
The bird in the cage.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.556
When, oh, when will it come out

06:29.806 --> 06:34.311
In the night of dawn

06:34.811 --> 06:38.857
The crane and turtle slipped

06:39.191 --> 06:43.320
Who is behind you now?

06:43.654 --> 06:45.239
Good to see you children.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.942
The Governor!

08:07.362 --> 08:08.822
Come on, let's move!

27:26.897 --> 27:30.025
Where did you come from?

27:30.317 --> 27:32.611
Do you want to join us?

27:32.653 --> 27:35.906
There are so many of us.

27:36.365 --> 27:39.618
What's your name?

27:39.952 --> 27:42.996
Can't you speak?
Say something!

27:43.038 --> 27:46.041
Hey! Talk!

27:51.547 --> 27:55.384
We are almost there!
Hang in there!

29:10.250 --> 29:11.835
If time starts moving...

29:12.169 --> 29:14.755
...everything will explode again!

29:15.172 --> 29:18.342
Keep time from moving!

29:24.932 --> 29:26.099
Thick red blood!

29:27.392 --> 29:29.102
He has thick red blood!

29:32.898 --> 29:35.234
The Prophecy!
Time will move again!

29:41.281 --> 29:42.741
Thick red blood!

29:43.158 --> 29:44.993
Maybe someday...

29:45.035 --> 29:48.372
...these children can drink
wonderful water...

29:48.413 --> 29:52.334
...breathe wonderful air.
live in a wonderful world!

29:52.376 --> 29:55.045
Feel the fresh blood
on their faces!

30:13.105 --> 30:14.773
Stop it!

30:49.391 --> 30:51.685
Ratman! Get the fuck out!

32:07.052 --> 32:08.929
Go find her yourself!

34:28.735 --> 34:30.571
Everyone!

34:30.612 --> 34:32.322
It's time to read.

42:52.614 --> 42:55.117
These are delicious.
I'll give you some.

50:20.521 --> 50:23.690
Many years ago,
when I was just a child

50:24.274 --> 50:28.195
There was a catastrophic wreck,
at mile 244...

50:29.112 --> 50:31.281
It was the age of nuclear towers.

50:31.990 --> 50:34.284
There was a massive reactor,

50:34.785 --> 50:38.497
strong enough to power an empire,

50:38.747 --> 50:40.457
...or destroy it.

50:41.875 --> 50:46.672
Beneath it all...
the waste, the boiling toxic waste.

50:46.713 --> 50:49.258
Buried, hidden, unclean.

50:49.299 --> 50:50.968
The hidden secret legacy.

50:51.301 --> 50:54.972
A mighty tanker burdened with
molten nuclear sludge.

50:55.639 --> 50:59.935
On the searing highway
outside of the city... lost control.

51:00.394 --> 51:05.482
It struck a transport carrying
deadly convicted men.

51:06.316 --> 51:10.737
Covering them all with
the scalding atomic disease.

51:11.697 --> 51:14.992
The burning!
The hideous burning!

51:15.033 --> 51:19.121
The fire crept into the soil,
the ancient polluted earth

51:19.705 --> 51:23.250
Every stone and tree had
sucked up the buried poison.

51:23.542 --> 51:26.628
The entire city burst into flames!

51:52.779 --> 51:54.573
We called for help!

51:54.615 --> 51:57.534
We called to the powerful
men in the atomic towers.

51:57.951 --> 52:02.539
But the men of the toxic
empire could not confess it.

52:03.040 --> 52:04.791
They must deny it...

52:04.833 --> 52:06.460
Deny them all.

52:20.849 --> 52:23.185
You found Bernice. The innocent soul.

52:23.477 --> 52:25.229
Gave her a chance.

52:25.604 --> 52:27.689
You are a hero.

55:04.972 --> 55:06.223
It's empty!

55:06.640 --> 55:08.016
I'm sorry!

55:17.109 --> 55:18.861
Governor, you command all the time.

55:20.821 --> 55:22.489
You are the time!

55:23.073 --> 55:27.035
You are the greatest and
most powerful clock.

55:27.828 --> 55:30.831
And your second hand is sharp and
more dangerous than a knife!

1:03:29.726 --> 1:03:31.979
You have a duty to complete.

1:03:32.229 --> 1:03:35.065
We will give you another life.

1:04:07.639 --> 1:04:10.475
Hello girls!
Good evening.

1:04:10.726 --> 1:04:13.604
There are so many pretty girls.

1:04:15.647 --> 1:04:18.692
Don't I deserve a girl tonight?

1:04:19.401 --> 1:04:20.819
You?

1:04:22.905 --> 1:04:25.574
You are a pretty one, too.

1:04:28.535 --> 1:04:29.828
Hey!

1:04:30.162 --> 1:04:32.623
Yasujiro!

1:04:34.041 --> 1:04:37.127
Who should I pick?

1:04:37.920 --> 1:04:40.255
Did you pick already?

1:04:40.297 --> 1:04:41.882
Yasujiro-chan!

1:04:42.174 --> 1:04:43.383
Brother?

1:04:43.425 --> 1:04:45.260
Brother, are you here?

1:04:45.302 --> 1:04:48.347
Is this your sister Yasujiro?!

1:04:49.681 --> 1:04:50.974
Show yourself now!

1:04:51.266 --> 1:04:52.476
Brother!

1:04:52.518 --> 1:04:54.102
Brother, are you here!

1:04:54.144 --> 1:04:55.270
Show your face!

1:05:02.194 --> 1:05:03.237
Kill him!

1:05:50.701 --> 1:05:52.327
Brother wait!

1:05:52.911 --> 1:05:54.454
I know everything!

1:05:56.456 --> 1:06:00.794
You work for the Governor
because of me.

1:06:01.503 --> 1:06:05.465
He promised if you did then
he would let me go, didn't he?

1:06:06.258 --> 1:06:07.551
That's a lie!

1:06:07.926 --> 1:06:09.344
He is a liar!

1:06:10.304 --> 1:06:11.847
Brother...

1:06:12.222 --> 1:06:14.224
Please leave him.

1:08:06.128 --> 1:08:09.590
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

1:08:14.344 --> 1:08:17.221
Where did you come from?
Where are you from?

1:08:26.356 --> 1:08:27.691
Please.

1:08:28.399 --> 1:08:30.611
Thank you very much.

1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:44.082
Delicious.

1:08:54.051 --> 1:08:56.511
Where are you going?
Wait.

1:08:56.553 --> 1:08:58.305
I'm coming with you.
Where are you going?

1:09:00.807 --> 1:09:03.227
Hero! Hey! Hero!

1:09:03.560 --> 1:09:07.523
Where are you going?
Hero!

1:12:59.296 --> 1:13:01.632
It doesn't matter anyway!

1:13:28.033 --> 1:13:29.493
Forward! Forward!

1:14:11.702 --> 1:14:14.496
Hey! Ratman is having fun.
Let's go!

1:17:03.123 --> 1:17:06.793
It crashed into the bus
carrying violent convicts.

1:17:07.711 --> 1:17:11.924
It covered them in nuclear waste.

1:17:13.342 --> 1:17:15.969
The burning!
The hideous burning!

1:20:06.348 --> 1:20:07.808
Maybe it's a lie.

1:20:14.231 --> 1:20:16.441
Here they come!

1:28:24.888 --> 1:28:29.434
Governor, I thought there was going to
be a statue of you in this town!

1:28:32.771 --> 1:28:34.189
You don't have any money!

1:28:34.231 --> 1:28:35.399
You are useless.

1:28:35.440 --> 1:28:36.441
Loser!

1:33:34.865 --> 1:33:37.618
Everyone!
We are free!

1:33:47.669 --> 1:33:49.463
We are free from time!

1:33:49.755 --> 1:33:51.632
You can let go!

1:34:13.278 --> 1:34:16.448
Look, they did it!
Time is starting again! Quick!
