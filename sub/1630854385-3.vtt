00:01.218 --> 00:03.916
<i>Previously on "The Real
Housewives of Salt Lake City"...</i>

00:03.960 --> 00:06.310
I love Arizona in the winter...

00:06.354 --> 00:08.530
What's up?!

00:08.573 --> 00:10.793
I just wanted the girls
to get away for Jen,

00:10.836 --> 00:14.188
to come together and show you
our love and support for you.

00:15.102 --> 00:19.584
I was more vested and in love
with the idea of being, like,

00:19.628 --> 00:21.543
Meredith's best friend,
like her sister,

00:21.586 --> 00:23.936
and it wasn't what
I thought it was.

00:23.980 --> 00:25.503
I just heard that she was,
you know,

00:25.547 --> 00:28.811
doing favors to help get places
to pick on Vida Tequila.

00:28.854 --> 00:31.727
Meredith brought up rumors
about Lisa having--

00:31.770 --> 00:33.207
- About what?
- Affairs.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.860
You have to swallow it
and bury it.

00:36.558 --> 00:38.386
We're all gonna start
the breath together.

00:39.909 --> 00:41.432
Good.

00:41.476 --> 00:43.565
What did everybody release?

00:43.608 --> 00:47.569
I wanted to release the fear
of going to trial in a month.

00:55.620 --> 00:59.624
...that I was actually abused,
and I just don't remember it.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.104
Oh, my gosh.

01:06.762 --> 01:08.459
Are you okay, Whitney?

01:08.503 --> 01:10.983
I've been
on this healing journey for

01:11.027 --> 01:13.377
honestly, probably a year now.

01:13.421 --> 01:16.337
A lot of--I have--
my childhood is blocked

01:16.380 --> 01:19.166
from, like, 9 to 17.

01:19.209 --> 01:22.517
And as I'm doing all this work,

01:22.560 --> 01:25.259
like, memories are coming up, and...

01:28.784 --> 01:31.308
There's abuse in my family,
but I, like, stuffed it so deep

01:31.352 --> 01:33.615
that I blocked all memory of it.

01:36.792 --> 01:38.533
You?

01:38.576 --> 01:40.535
Yeah.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.586
- I'm so sorry.
- But--Yeah, thank you.

01:48.630 --> 01:51.241
How do you deal
with something like that?

01:51.285 --> 01:53.156
It's just recovered memory
or what?

01:53.200 --> 01:57.247
Like, how did you
figure this out?

01:57.291 --> 02:00.207
It was, like,
it's hard to explain.

02:00.250 --> 02:03.471
I-I don't know. Like...

02:03.514 --> 02:04.776
- No, you don't have to.
- It's just hard to explain.

02:04.820 --> 02:06.996
Like, you know how, like,
you have feelings,

02:07.039 --> 02:08.954
like, that you just don't know
where it comes from?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.608
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, that's how you

02:10.652 --> 02:12.784
figure it out, that where
that does that come from?

02:12.828 --> 02:18.660
I've learned that the abuse
has gone on generationally.

02:20.662 --> 02:23.404
I'm literally breaking the cycle
for my family,

02:23.447 --> 02:26.233
and that's all I care about.

02:26.276 --> 02:28.409
You're brave, Whitney.

02:31.325 --> 02:33.631
There's no easy or right time

02:33.675 --> 02:40.072
to share this type
of information with people,

02:40.116 --> 02:44.816
but I need my friends.

02:44.860 --> 02:49.604
And it actually feels good
to get it out,

02:49.647 --> 02:54.522
and I do feel that they love
and support me.

02:54.565 --> 02:56.611
My siblings, Curtis and Kelli,

02:56.654 --> 02:58.395
they're all
on a similar journey,

02:58.439 --> 02:59.657
and we're all coming together,

02:59.701 --> 03:01.006
and I get to see
my brother Curtis

03:01.050 --> 03:04.184
that I haven't seen in years.

03:04.227 --> 03:10.015
I feel... betrayed for you.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.844
To be honest, I'm freaking out.

03:12.888 --> 03:16.848
I feel like all the wind
has, like, left my lungs.

03:16.892 --> 03:20.983
To absolutely block something
out of your memory

03:21.026 --> 03:26.249
because it's so traumatic,
it has to have been horrific.

03:26.293 --> 03:30.210
And my heart is breaking.

03:31.689 --> 03:34.779
We have to put it--
everything on the table.

03:34.823 --> 03:37.042
We have to work through our
sh-- literally, because, like--

03:37.086 --> 03:38.740
- Yeah.
- It's not worth it

03:38.783 --> 03:40.307
to hold it in.

03:40.350 --> 03:43.092
But it's easy for me
to be vulnerable. It is.

03:43.135 --> 03:45.312
And I know it's not as easy
for, like, others.

03:45.355 --> 03:47.052
Not easy for...

03:47.096 --> 03:48.358
- Well, yeah, I think, yeah.
- ...all these women here.

03:48.402 --> 03:50.534
Both of them. So no pressure,

03:50.578 --> 03:52.493
Meredith and Lisa.
I know you need time.

03:52.536 --> 03:55.191
Whitney's like,
"Pass the conch."

03:55.235 --> 03:56.497
You wanna know the truth?

03:56.540 --> 03:58.194
I think all my problems
last year

03:58.238 --> 04:00.762
stemmed because I <i>did</i>
make myself vulnerable.

04:00.805 --> 04:02.677
You know,
you feel like you open up,

04:02.720 --> 04:05.288
and you get slapped in the face
for it.

04:05.332 --> 04:07.682
Meredith, again,
I owe you an apology.

04:07.725 --> 04:10.206
I apologized in L.A.,
and I wanna say it again.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.208
What I said was hyperbolic.
I do not mean them.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.906
I apologize for them.
I don't think those things.

04:14.950 --> 04:18.040
I was very hurt, and I said
things that I regret,

04:18.083 --> 04:20.825
and I regret my poor choice
of words. I regret them--

04:20.869 --> 04:22.392
So you don't regret--
So you don't regret

04:22.436 --> 04:26.178
the vitriol, venom, and hatred
that you spewed.

04:26.222 --> 04:28.920
You don't regret what you said
but only your choice of words.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.314
Meredith, all I can say
is I'm deeply sorry, and...

04:31.358 --> 04:32.750
- No, no, no, no.
- And I am extremely sorry.

04:32.794 --> 04:34.970
We need to back up,
because the things you said--

04:35.013 --> 04:36.667
I've never confided in you, Lisa...

04:36.711 --> 04:38.278
- You haven't.
- ...because I never

04:38.321 --> 04:39.627
fully trusted you.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.585
Okay, thank you
for telling me that.

04:41.629 --> 04:43.065
- And now I know why.
- Thank you for telling me that.

04:43.108 --> 04:44.893
- So the things you said...
- I'm glad to know.

04:44.936 --> 04:45.981
...you made up.

04:48.157 --> 04:49.289
No.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.335
That's the truth!

04:52.379 --> 04:55.947
I'm human, and I was hurt.
That was a very hard--

04:55.991 --> 04:57.601
Because somebody told you
I said your house was ugly.

04:57.645 --> 04:59.821
Yes. No, it was not
because of that.

04:59.864 --> 05:01.736
That's what you told me in L.A.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.825
You spoke poorly
of my whole family.

05:03.868 --> 05:04.869
I--And--And...

05:08.351 --> 05:09.787
And I was like--

05:09.831 --> 05:11.659
What would I say
about your renovation?

05:13.574 --> 05:17.317
I think she deeply, <i>deeply</i>
regrets saying it.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.144
- Okay.
- Am I wrong?

05:19.188 --> 05:20.798
You're not wrong at all.

05:20.842 --> 05:23.279
If you're able
to be accountable,

05:23.323 --> 05:28.806
and you want to move forward,
your behavior is not acceptable.

05:28.850 --> 05:32.419
That one day was not
an aberration.

05:32.462 --> 05:33.985
There have been other instances

05:34.029 --> 05:35.639
of you speaking very poorly
about me other than that.

05:35.683 --> 05:37.946
- I am well aware of that.
- There are not.

05:37.989 --> 05:39.861
- Everything going on--
- Can I finish speaking, Lisa?

05:39.904 --> 05:42.559
- Okay.
- You are an interrupter.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.606
Please stop interrupting me.
It is very impolite.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.304
I don't know if there's

05:48.348 --> 05:50.132
something more significant
going on.

05:50.175 --> 05:51.438
There is not. Anything more--

05:51.481 --> 05:52.830
Can you stop interrupting, please?

05:52.874 --> 05:54.266
Okay, you're making statements
that are not true.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.747
- I'm almost finished.
- So I'm not okay with that.

05:56.791 --> 06:00.751
I'm almost finished, and then
you can say whatever you want.

06:00.795 --> 06:03.667
If you think that
this is normal behavior,

06:03.711 --> 06:07.367
and you don't want to get help
and make changes,

06:07.410 --> 06:09.586
then there's no more
I can do for you.

06:09.630 --> 06:12.502
If you think that you should be
getting some help,

06:12.546 --> 06:14.417
I'm happy to help you.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.507
What kind of help
do I need, Meredith?

06:17.551 --> 06:19.161
- But that's it. I don't know.
- I wanna know.

06:19.204 --> 06:20.902
- What kind of help do I need?
- I don't profess to be a doctor.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.164
- Excuse me.
- You saying that

06:22.207 --> 06:24.427
is gonna absolutely trigger her.

06:24.471 --> 06:26.168
- Yeah. Wow.
- And she's still lying.

06:26.211 --> 06:27.691
I don't like you commenting

06:27.735 --> 06:29.650
on my mental stability
and health.

06:29.693 --> 06:31.086
I didn't say
your mental stability.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.609
- You basically did.
- No, I did not.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.045
And that's a low blow.
That's a low blow.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.395
I did not.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.874
The words that are coming
from Meredith's mouth

06:36.918 --> 06:41.488
are not dirty or mean,
but they cut a bitch.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.447
Once I meet with your therapist

06:44.491 --> 06:49.452
and she deems you worthy,
then I shall perhaps consider

06:49.496 --> 06:51.933
a path to resolution,
but until then,

06:51.976 --> 06:54.239
I can't help you.
I can't help you

06:54.283 --> 06:57.417
until you help yourself.

07:01.116 --> 07:03.988
No, Lisa, look at me. Explain
where the pain comes from, Lisa.

07:04.032 --> 07:05.773
- Explain it.
- Too little, too late.

07:14.172 --> 07:18.263
For the last year and a half,
it was extremely hurtful to me

07:18.307 --> 07:22.137
that I could tell you feelings
I was feeling of hurt,

07:22.180 --> 07:24.618
and it was disregarded.

07:24.661 --> 07:26.707
Everybody talks sh--
about everybody,

07:26.750 --> 07:28.535
and it's how
we're gonna move forward.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.058
I'm not gonna slit my wrist
for anybody.

07:30.101 --> 07:31.320
- I will speak for myself.
- That's a horrible thing to say.

07:31.363 --> 07:32.582
No, it's not. It is not.
It's--No.

07:32.626 --> 07:37.021
You know what? Stop. Stop.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.985
No... What?

07:45.769 --> 07:47.467
Oh, I did not know that.
I did not--

07:47.510 --> 07:49.991
Oh, she didn't----ing know it?
That's what she's gonna tell me?

07:50.034 --> 07:52.863
Oh, my God!

07:52.907 --> 07:55.562
I am so sorry, Meredith, for--
to use that analogy.

07:55.605 --> 07:58.303
- I didn't realize that. Like--
- I think we--

07:58.347 --> 08:00.654
I think we need to stop this
for a minute now. It's enough.

08:00.697 --> 08:01.959
I will come up
with a different thing.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.570
- You're okay.
- I've had enough.

08:03.613 --> 08:06.573
Okay, have a sip of wine.
Have a bite of fish.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.966
Oh, my gosh.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.447
I do not think that Lisa
means this as a dig.

08:11.491 --> 08:13.710
This is just the way
Lisa talks

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
whether it's acceptable
or not.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.844
I'm not gonna slit my wrists
for anybody

08:16.887 --> 08:19.977
at this stage in my life.
I'm not doing it.

08:20.021 --> 08:21.979
It's like Meredith
is just pulling

08:22.023 --> 08:26.506
at any last string she can
to be mad at Lisa.

08:26.549 --> 08:28.333
I wanna say something, like,

08:28.377 --> 08:33.513
I wouldn't be here without
my husbands and my kids...

08:33.556 --> 08:35.340
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and my faith.

08:35.384 --> 08:38.039
You just don't ever know
till you go through a situation.

08:38.082 --> 08:43.566
And I hope nobody here ever goes
through a situation like this.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.176
I would never wish it
upon anyone,

08:45.220 --> 08:49.746
but petty things that, you know,
you fight over,

08:49.790 --> 08:51.008
this whole thing put it
into perspective

08:51.052 --> 08:54.882
where I'm just like,
the people that are...

08:54.925 --> 08:59.364
important to me in my life,
it's just important for me

08:59.408 --> 09:02.324
to show them how much I love,
care, and appreciate them.

09:05.327 --> 09:08.156
- Amen, Jen Shah.
- A----ing men to Jen Shah.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.988
Lisa, I appreciate your apology,
and I hear you.

09:14.031 --> 09:17.557
Um... we are not at a point
of resolution yet.

09:17.600 --> 09:19.036
If that's what you want,

09:19.080 --> 09:21.212
we will have to have
much more discussion,

09:21.256 --> 09:24.346
but I do appreciate
your apology. Thank you.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.696
Thanks for hearing me.
I appreciate that.

09:29.656 --> 09:31.571
Should we burn something?

09:31.614 --> 09:33.268
Like, should we set something
on fire?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.835
Let's set Lisa on fire.
I feel like she's ready for it.

09:34.878 --> 09:38.273
Yes. Uh... Yeah.
I have hair extensions.

09:38.316 --> 09:39.709
It'll singe.

09:42.843 --> 09:44.409
<i>Coming up...</i>

09:44.453 --> 09:47.891
you for calling me
a----ing liar!

09:47.935 --> 09:50.677
- You called me a liar.
- Goddamn you!

09:50.720 --> 09:53.288
<i>you!</i>

10:08.695 --> 10:11.436
Good morning!

10:11.480 --> 10:12.960
Heather? Are you up?

10:13.003 --> 10:16.485
Good morning.
Oh, yeah. Good morning to you.

10:16.528 --> 10:17.791
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:17.834 --> 10:21.055
Come in bed.
You're up before me?

10:21.098 --> 10:21.969
Yeah.

10:22.012 --> 10:23.492
I'm here to wake the hoes up.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.189
Wake all the hoes up.

10:25.233 --> 10:26.800
♪ Where are the hoes

10:26.843 --> 10:29.672
♪ In this house?

10:29.716 --> 10:31.587
Oh, my God. Crazy.

10:31.631 --> 10:34.677
I'm just here
to get you ready.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.811
- Okay.
- We're going on a bike trolley

10:37.854 --> 10:40.988
drinking trip.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.294
You said my favorite word--
"trolley."

10:43.338 --> 10:44.644
Yeah.

10:45.514 --> 10:47.081
Uh, concierge, please,

10:47.124 --> 10:48.735
to Heather's room
with the coffee.

10:50.345 --> 10:52.390
Last night was really heavy.

10:52.434 --> 10:55.045
I'm just trying to have fun.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.961
I ain't trying to make you cry
and drink "cao-coochie"

10:58.005 --> 10:59.876
or whatever we drank
the other night.

10:59.920 --> 11:04.054
Cacao is a deep
heart opening medicine.

11:05.186 --> 11:07.884
I thought
it would taste different.

11:07.928 --> 11:09.103
It's earthy.

11:09.146 --> 11:10.844
Whitney said we can all plan
an event,

11:10.887 --> 11:13.803
so can we please turn up here, please?

11:13.847 --> 11:16.458
Good morning!

11:18.329 --> 11:19.287
Good morning.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.289
<i>- Morning. How you doing?</i>
- Good.

11:21.332 --> 11:22.943
Boys on time for school?

11:22.986 --> 11:26.860
<i>Jack was. I unfortunately did
not help Henry out with it,</i>

11:26.903 --> 11:28.644
<i>so he was a little late.</i>

11:28.688 --> 11:31.125
Oh, my gosh. The kid's, like,
slow getting ready.

11:31.168 --> 11:35.738
So last night, we had dinner
together as a group.

11:35.782 --> 11:38.741
I apologized to Meredith.
She played doctor for a minute,

11:38.785 --> 11:41.352
but, um, you know, overall,

11:41.396 --> 11:44.399
I feel, like,
resolved in it all.

11:44.442 --> 11:46.836
Like, basically, all I'm gonna
do is have fun today.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.229
Like, from the other stuff.

11:48.272 --> 11:50.187
Well, I had that--
you know how I was planning

11:50.231 --> 11:52.102
that, like, little rodeo
experience with the girls

11:52.146 --> 11:54.844
because I love horses so much?

11:54.888 --> 11:56.977
So we're going to do that.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.067
- I love you. <i>
- I love you.</i>

12:00.110 --> 12:02.243
My booty squad.

12:06.247 --> 12:08.205
- Who is it?
- It's Heather.

12:08.249 --> 12:10.773
- Come on in.
- What are you doing?

12:10.817 --> 12:13.994
A little makeup.

12:14.037 --> 12:19.564
I mean, a glam team
in the middle of Arizona?

12:19.608 --> 12:20.957
Isn't that an oxymoron?

12:21.001 --> 12:23.699
Like, who are you gonna impress?
The cacti?

12:23.743 --> 12:27.790
The tumbleweeds?

12:27.834 --> 12:29.792
The girls on the girls trip?

12:29.836 --> 12:31.925
What look are you guys
going for today?

12:31.968 --> 12:33.796
I love it.

12:33.840 --> 12:36.190
Very Jen Shah of you.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.235
- This is a great setup.
- Yeah.

12:38.279 --> 12:40.847
Right. So I was coming in
to talk to you.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.676
I mean, right now, like, are you
just gonna move on with Lisa?

12:44.720 --> 12:48.245
Here's the problem that I have.
I was very honest

12:48.289 --> 12:52.249
in what I needed to be able to
move forward as a real friend.

12:52.293 --> 12:56.471
You can say "I'm sorry"
till you're blue in the face,

12:56.514 --> 12:58.690
but unless you're willing
to change the behavior,

12:58.734 --> 13:01.911
the apology becomes irrelevant.

13:03.521 --> 13:05.828
I still don't understand how
Lisa is gonna show you

13:05.872 --> 13:08.962
that she wants to be
your friend,

13:09.005 --> 13:10.702
and I feel like you are
coming off

13:10.746 --> 13:14.228
as condescending
and superior.

13:14.271 --> 13:15.795
I'm not superior.
I'm telling you

13:15.838 --> 13:19.450
I don't find it acceptable
to treat me that way, Heather.

13:19.494 --> 13:22.627
I'm not willing
to open myself up

13:22.671 --> 13:25.282
to somebody who's just gonna
stab me in the heart.

13:25.326 --> 13:27.371
- Okay? I'm not.
- I'm going to tell you right now

13:27.415 --> 13:30.070
you need to look at your life
and look at situations where

13:30.113 --> 13:32.420
you have taken that risk
with other people

13:32.463 --> 13:34.814
who have hurt you
and stabbed you in the back...

13:36.554 --> 13:39.514
...and given them more grace
than you're giving Lisa.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.863
Put that in your pipe
and smoke it.

13:40.907 --> 13:42.517
That's really not true.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.911
Stop being a condescending,
superior bitch.

13:47.565 --> 13:50.220
Come down a few notches,
and let's just have fun.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.267
I'm saying that I'm fine
with her at surface level,

13:53.310 --> 13:54.921
that I don't trust her.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.400
That makes me
a condescending person?

13:56.444 --> 13:57.967
- No!
- I don't trust her.

13:58.011 --> 13:59.186
Saying that, "I will help you
learn how to be my friend"

13:59.229 --> 14:00.448
sounds condescending.
I don't--

14:00.491 --> 14:02.015
That's not what I said, Heather.

14:02.058 --> 14:04.887
What I said was,
"I can't be treated that way,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.410
and if you wanna work
on yourself..."

14:06.454 --> 14:07.977
I don't think you should be
treated that way either.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.153
"...so we can figure out
how we got there,

14:10.197 --> 14:12.634
then I'm happy to work
with you." That is all I said.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.288
Okay. The most important thing
you just said is,

14:14.331 --> 14:16.420
"How <i>we</i> got there," because
you got there with her.

14:16.464 --> 14:18.161
- Correct.
- And I think you need to be

14:18.205 --> 14:20.598
more open to that and open
to what she has to say.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.905
All I'm saying
is I don't tolerate

14:22.949 --> 14:24.124
the way she treated me.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.039
And I think that is
crystal clear.

14:26.082 --> 14:27.127
- Okay. So that's it.
- What I'm not clear on...

14:27.170 --> 14:28.563
There's nothing else
to talk about.

14:28.606 --> 14:30.434
I feel frustrated
'cause I know Meredith

14:30.478 --> 14:34.351
is capable of forgiving Lisa,
but she doesn't want to.

14:34.395 --> 14:36.919
And while there's a part of me
that understands that deeply,

14:36.963 --> 14:38.921
I'm kind of over it.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.931
Where my hoes at?

14:48.975 --> 14:49.758
Oh, not in the bathroom.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.194
Whoo!

14:51.238 --> 14:54.110
Yes!

14:54.154 --> 14:57.461
You look like a rock star!

14:57.505 --> 15:00.987
Oh, now here we have
the belle of the ball.

15:02.989 --> 15:05.078
I hope you are ready for this.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.557
- Sprinter van.
- Stay warm.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.516
We're all here!

15:18.830 --> 15:20.789
We have arrived at our stop.

15:20.832 --> 15:22.965
- You guys, we're here.
- Hello. Let's go.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.532
Thanks, Zack.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.276
- I see a captain hat!
- How's it going, ladies?

15:29.319 --> 15:30.973
Our captain!

15:31.017 --> 15:32.583
Who's ready to party?

15:32.627 --> 15:34.411
- We are ready to party.
- Yeah!

15:34.455 --> 15:36.848
All aboard the Jen Shah Express!

15:36.892 --> 15:39.460
Whoo!

15:39.503 --> 15:42.593
I got some red wine.
I got some... rosé.

15:42.637 --> 15:44.944
- Rosé all day.
- And a place for this.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.990
You guys, this is about to be
the funnest bike ride...

15:48.034 --> 15:49.600
- That is right.
- ...we've ever done.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.821
All right, ready?
Everybody, pedal, pedal, pedal!

15:56.477 --> 15:58.958
Yeah!
Put your back into it!

15:59.001 --> 16:02.396
Yes! Whoo! Whoo!

16:02.439 --> 16:04.311
I think booze and bike rides

16:04.354 --> 16:06.139
is what this group needs
right now,

16:06.182 --> 16:08.489
and I don't want
all these little squabbles

16:08.532 --> 16:10.534
to overshine what
the real reason of this trip is.

16:10.578 --> 16:12.667
This isn't about me.
This isn't about anyone else.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.017
It's coming together
to support Jen...

16:15.061 --> 16:17.150
Whoo!

16:17.193 --> 16:19.674
...and help Whitney heal. <i></i>

16:19.717 --> 16:20.936
Whoo!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.764
Got a stripper pole!

16:22.807 --> 16:24.157
Yeah!

16:34.950 --> 16:37.083
We all know Whitney likes
her coochie wet, okay?

16:37.126 --> 16:38.954
Whoo!

16:38.998 --> 16:40.869
Ground that bitch.

16:40.912 --> 16:44.786
Aah! Whoo!

16:46.135 --> 16:48.703
Hey, is this
a wet t-shirt contest?

16:48.746 --> 16:51.010
Whoo!

16:51.053 --> 16:53.534
Okay, Jen Shah!

16:53.577 --> 16:54.709
Yeah!

17:01.368 --> 17:03.718
Oh, my God!
This one's exploding!

17:03.761 --> 17:05.546
- Whoo!
- Yes!

17:05.589 --> 17:06.982
Whoo!

17:07.026 --> 17:12.118
Watching Lisa and Meredith
passive-aggressively

17:12.161 --> 17:13.902
throw cheap wine
at each other...

17:17.427 --> 17:19.125
...I'm living for it. <i></i>

17:19.168 --> 17:21.475
All right, did you all
have a good time?

17:21.518 --> 17:23.868
Yes, Captain Kev!

17:23.912 --> 17:25.914
Kevin, thank you.
We love you.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.090
I need a shower!

17:28.134 --> 17:29.091
<i>Coming up...</i>

17:29.135 --> 17:30.745
I didn't spread rumors.

17:30.788 --> 17:32.181
- No, because--
- You came to <i>me</i> with it.

17:32.225 --> 17:33.791
Well, you came to me, too.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.984
Zack the snack,
thank you, my friend.

17:53.028 --> 17:54.725
Thanks, Zack.

17:54.769 --> 17:57.424
Okay, you guys,
so there's a reason

17:57.467 --> 17:59.817
why I'm in Dior boots.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.515
You guys are gonna love
this show.

18:01.558 --> 18:07.260
These women performed for Dior
and were featured in "Vogue."

18:07.303 --> 18:09.610
So we're just gonna go this way.

18:09.653 --> 18:12.134
When you think Arizona,
you definitely think rodeo.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.527
It's a private show.

18:13.570 --> 18:17.313
Well, at least I do,
and these women are amazing.

18:17.357 --> 18:19.837
There's eight riders,
and they're gonna perform

18:19.881 --> 18:21.230
a series of drills for us

18:21.274 --> 18:23.928
that are, like, synchronized
to perfection.

18:23.972 --> 18:28.019
Horses have always been
so healing for me.

18:28.063 --> 18:29.412
Let's sit.

18:29.456 --> 18:31.066
So maybe this will be
a great bonding experience

18:31.110 --> 18:32.807
for all of us.

18:35.766 --> 18:37.203
Here they come.

18:37.246 --> 18:40.510
Wow.

18:40.554 --> 18:44.210
Are we supposed to... um, clap
or just, like, respect

18:44.253 --> 18:45.036
and be quiet?
- I think we just respect.

18:45.080 --> 18:48.170
Okay.

18:48.214 --> 18:49.215
Oh!

18:49.258 --> 18:51.695
- Wow.
- Wow.

18:53.567 --> 18:56.874
That's gorgeous. Take a pic.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.051
<i>Cuatro!</i>

19:02.402 --> 19:04.186
Wow.

19:04.230 --> 19:07.146
I think, gosh, that is amazing.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.630
- Thank you. Hello, ladies.
- Hello.

19:13.674 --> 19:15.545
- That was amazing.
- Hi, America.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.504
- Hi, Lisa. How are you?
- Good. Good to see you.

19:17.547 --> 19:18.853
Good to see you.
How's it going?

19:18.896 --> 19:20.550
Thanks for doing this for us.
It's so magical.

19:20.594 --> 19:23.597
No, you're welcome. This is our
team, Escaramuza Chara Rayenari,

19:23.640 --> 19:27.035
and we're very happy
to have you here.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.733
Explain how you're sitting.
I've never seen that before.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.736
So our dresses are inspired
in the Adelitas,

19:32.780 --> 19:34.956
who fought in the revolution
in Mexico.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.132
But it was not proper
to ride like a man.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.047
So we ride sidesaddle.

19:39.090 --> 19:42.050
It's called keeping your knees
together, Whit.

19:42.093 --> 19:44.270
Beautiful.

19:44.313 --> 19:46.576
We've set up a few dresses
for you girls

19:46.620 --> 19:48.404
if you guys wanna try it on.

19:48.448 --> 19:49.753
- Dresses?
- Yes.

19:49.797 --> 19:51.668
Similar to ours,
a few different colors.

19:51.712 --> 19:54.497
We have them set up for you so
that you can come and join us.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.064
But the outfits are
right over here.

19:56.107 --> 19:59.023
Do you guys wanna follow me?

19:59.067 --> 20:00.590
Yeah. And she was like,

20:00.634 --> 20:03.419
"These are from
the Gaucho collection in 2007."

20:03.463 --> 20:05.508
John got these for me.

20:05.552 --> 20:08.381
So if you guys wanna pick a fit,
I'm gonna wear this one.

20:08.424 --> 20:10.644
Whitney, with your black hat.

20:10.687 --> 20:13.037
This blue and purple
is gorgeous.

20:14.735 --> 20:16.040
- Okay.
- Yeah, I'll do that one.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.045
Should we just, like,
throw 'em on right here?

20:21.089 --> 20:22.177
Yeah, let's do it right here.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.309
Cinch my waist.

20:23.352 --> 20:24.440
Cinch it like a girdle.

20:24.484 --> 20:27.138
Go. Yeah. Yes!

20:27.182 --> 20:30.403
I wanted to tell you, I talked
to Meredith this morning.

20:30.446 --> 20:33.667
I just basically said to her,
"You are sounding

20:33.710 --> 20:37.758
like a superior, condescending
friend that's putting terms

20:37.801 --> 20:39.281
on why you'll be friends
with Lisa."

20:39.325 --> 20:42.676
Like, "She must get help.
She must show me how she cares."

20:42.719 --> 20:46.723
But the truth is, when I got
on the trolley, it was fun.

20:46.767 --> 20:49.291
From my perspective, when is
enough enough with Meredith?

20:49.335 --> 20:50.771
Because, like,
we went through this

20:50.814 --> 20:53.730
for the last two years with Jen.
I don't--

20:53.774 --> 20:55.471
- Exactly.
- I'm not doing this.

20:55.515 --> 20:56.603
And she is any happier than she
is for holding Jen to the fire?

20:56.646 --> 20:58.213
- No, and I'm not--No.
- She's not.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.650
How's everything going after
last night with you and Lisa?

21:00.694 --> 21:04.306
Um... it--it's just... is,
you know what I'm saying?

21:04.350 --> 21:08.615
Like, I don't think
that she genuinely believes

21:08.658 --> 21:10.399
she did anything wrong.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.533
I think she believes
she was <i>heard.</i>

21:17.276 --> 21:19.800
I really don't think it's fair
to Lisa that, like,

21:19.843 --> 21:23.369
we're all holding her, like,
to the cross,

21:23.412 --> 21:26.546
but yet we've all heard things
about her,

21:26.589 --> 21:28.199
and we all have
this information.

21:28.243 --> 21:30.506
- What do <i>you</i> know?
- I just heard that she was,

21:30.550 --> 21:32.465
you know, doing favors
to help get places

21:32.508 --> 21:34.075
to pick up Vida Tequila.

21:34.118 --> 21:36.904
It feels a bit hypocritical
to, like, hold her to the cross.

21:36.947 --> 21:39.341
And I would entirely--
I would entirely agree with you,

21:39.385 --> 21:42.866
except let's make
one big differentiation.

21:42.910 --> 21:48.045
I didn't spread rumors.
I said very loose and vague,

21:48.089 --> 21:51.135
there are rumors out there
pertaining to her marriage,

21:51.179 --> 21:56.140
pertaining to her finances,
pertaining to whatever.

21:58.099 --> 22:02.451
It doesn't matter how Meredith
wants to spin this narrative,

22:02.495 --> 22:05.367
you're talking sh--.

22:05.411 --> 22:06.977
Are you really gonna argue
semantics?

22:07.021 --> 22:10.459
I didn't go out there
and spread to the world.

22:10.503 --> 22:11.895
I did a one-on-one
quiet conversation...

22:11.939 --> 22:13.332
But are you planning on--
are you planning on having

22:13.375 --> 22:14.942
a one-on-one with her or no?
- ...with other people.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.335
- But what are you gonna--
- It's kind of not my problem.

22:16.378 --> 22:18.598
Well, I know.
But it <i>is</i> your problem.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.426
- No.
-'Cause you came to me with it.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.863
'Cause I--well,
you came to me, too.

22:22.906 --> 22:24.647
Hey!

22:24.691 --> 22:30.044
I feel like it's not fair
to move forward

22:30.087 --> 22:32.394
without telling Lisa.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.353
Put it all
on the fricking table.

22:34.396 --> 22:38.748
- Whitney, are you kidding me?
- This looks like ribbon candy.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.838
You yourself has said let's make
this fun and light for Jen.

22:41.882 --> 22:44.667
You think that's gonna make it
fun and light for Jen?

22:44.711 --> 22:46.103
Who wants to get on a horse?

22:46.147 --> 22:47.322
- I'm ready to ride for sure.
- I'll go, too.

22:47.366 --> 22:49.019
I'll do it.

22:49.063 --> 22:51.413
I'll walk next to you
for a minute. We'll see.

22:51.457 --> 22:54.198
One, two, three.

22:54.242 --> 22:55.765
- Ooh. Thank you.
- Yep.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.680
That's a good dude.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.943
Listen,
if this bitch bucks me off,

22:59.987 --> 23:01.945
I'm-a [bleep] him up.

23:03.207 --> 23:06.602
Well, on the dress
is the problem.

23:06.646 --> 23:07.603
I don't think I can do it.

23:07.647 --> 23:10.911
Just go. One, two, three.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.303
You're up there?

23:12.347 --> 23:13.870
Okay, hold on.

23:13.914 --> 23:16.133
- One, two, three.
- Go. No?

23:18.875 --> 23:24.185
Come on. Okay. I'm good.
I'm good. I'm good.

23:24.228 --> 23:27.101
Is the horse gonna care that
I have stilettos and not boots?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.628
Oh, I'm not straddling it?

23:32.672 --> 23:34.064
Wait. Right here?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.326
- Oh.
- Good.

23:35.370 --> 23:38.286
Sh--.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.722
Where do I hold?

23:39.766 --> 23:43.639
Oh. Oh, yeah. The reins.

23:43.683 --> 23:46.033
Single file.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.392
I love it. Yeah.

23:57.436 --> 23:59.612
Like, this is intense.

24:02.005 --> 24:05.400
Is this what you do in a parade?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.489
And then they throw flowers?

24:07.533 --> 24:10.318
What did you wear
for the Dior show? These?

24:12.886 --> 24:14.975
That's so crazy. My--
like, literally, my husband

24:15.018 --> 24:16.890
had bought me these boots.

24:16.933 --> 24:18.544
They were
for the Gaucho collection.

24:18.587 --> 24:21.024
I think the reason Lisa might
have brought us to this rodeo

24:21.068 --> 24:24.506
is to just show off
her Dior boots.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.377
And then I was like, "Oh,
they're so pretty for this."

24:26.421 --> 24:29.206
I mean, she did say it,
like, 10 times.

24:29.250 --> 24:31.078
Thank you so much.
Are you tired?

24:31.121 --> 24:33.384
Do you wanna get up here
with me?

24:35.343 --> 24:36.692
<i>Coming up...</i>

24:36.736 --> 24:41.131
You told me that she performed
sexual favors!

24:41.175 --> 24:43.656
Are you crazy?!

24:59.628 --> 25:01.630
Heather?

25:11.814 --> 25:13.773
What are you doing tonight?

25:13.816 --> 25:15.949
I am hosting...

25:15.992 --> 25:19.169
Garbage whore lingerie party.

25:19.213 --> 25:20.693
Oh, my God.

25:20.736 --> 25:22.259
I can't take all the credit
for that

25:22.303 --> 25:24.087
because I'm not the one
that came up with that.

25:24.131 --> 25:26.655
Actually, Lisa Barlow did.

25:30.311 --> 25:34.924
I felt like today that
Meredith and Lisa were good.

25:34.968 --> 25:37.840
This is what bugs me
about it is...

25:48.198 --> 25:49.983
If you don't have
firsthand knowledge of...

25:50.026 --> 25:52.028
But it's not--I know,
but, babe, think about it.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.160
- I'm trying to help Lisa...
- Do what?

25:53.203 --> 25:54.596
...mend a bridge with Meredith.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.164
I'm trying to help Meredith
mend a bridge with Lisa.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.905
Okay, let me tell you right now
it does not look like that.

25:58.948 --> 26:01.081
- And Meredith--It doesn't?
- So stop.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.387
But I just had this moment
at the horse thing

26:03.431 --> 26:04.911
where I was just like...

26:04.954 --> 26:07.566
like, what are you gonna do
about this?

26:07.609 --> 26:09.524
'Cause that's not fair.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.091
Right now I'm processing

26:11.134 --> 26:13.354
that there's a lot of secrets
in my family.

26:13.397 --> 26:17.967
Those secrets fester and build,
and they implode,

26:18.011 --> 26:21.449
so that is something
that I don't wanna do anymore.

26:21.492 --> 26:24.234
I want to break that cycle.

26:24.278 --> 26:29.588
We need to preheat the oven
to, like, 400. 425, actually.

26:32.547 --> 26:33.896
Whitney.

26:36.029 --> 26:38.640
Try to bend with your knees
when you do the oven.

26:38.684 --> 26:40.773
This isn't working for you?

26:40.816 --> 26:43.036
Wow!

26:43.079 --> 26:44.951
Well, well, ladies!

26:44.994 --> 26:47.518
Ohh!

26:47.562 --> 26:49.999
I love your hat.

26:55.222 --> 26:56.397
Hey.

26:56.440 --> 27:00.140
Um...

27:00.183 --> 27:01.881
I don't think that
that's lingerie.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.405
That's about on par
with a onesie.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.494
Clearly,
John doesn't see much skin.

27:06.537 --> 27:09.018
I think they're secret freaks, though.

27:09.062 --> 27:12.674
For a Mormon 2.0,
she is representing.

27:12.718 --> 27:15.677
Nary a nip or a cleavage
in sight.

27:15.721 --> 27:16.983
I feel sexy.

27:17.026 --> 27:19.899
I think we all dressed
to our personality,

27:19.942 --> 27:23.076
and clearly,
like, I dress to mine.

27:23.119 --> 27:25.034
All right,
does anyone want steak,

27:25.078 --> 27:26.383
or does everyone
just want salmon?

27:26.427 --> 27:27.646
I want steak.

27:27.689 --> 27:28.995
All right,
I'm gonna go fire up the grill.

27:29.038 --> 27:32.868
Is this the drive-thru?
Can I get an order?

27:36.742 --> 27:38.091
Welcome to

27:38.134 --> 27:39.701
the garbage whore
lingerie party.

27:41.616 --> 27:43.313
Um... Lisa?

27:43.357 --> 27:44.837
- I feel sexy. Don't talk.
- Okay.

27:49.276 --> 27:50.146
I need you to come help me
with meat,

27:50.190 --> 27:52.105
'cause you're the only one...

27:52.148 --> 27:53.628
- Can beat the meat?
- ...I trust with meat.

27:53.672 --> 27:54.803
Come on.

27:58.154 --> 27:59.416
Have you ever grilled
like this before?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.201
I haven't.

28:01.244 --> 28:03.203
We're gonna do
an open plate salad,

28:03.246 --> 28:04.770
make it look, like, super chic.

28:04.813 --> 28:05.858
Super chic.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.864
Yes, ma'am.

28:11.907 --> 28:15.476
Um... so I have a question
for you.

28:15.519 --> 28:17.173
Like, did you ever have
a conversation with Meredith

28:17.217 --> 28:20.873
talking about, like,
alleged affairs?

28:20.916 --> 28:23.353
Um... I'm not the one
that brought that up.

28:23.397 --> 28:25.312
- Okay.
- Meredith brought it up.

28:25.355 --> 28:26.661
And I said,
"Yeah, "I've heard it."

28:26.705 --> 28:29.359
I <i>have</i> heard it.

28:29.403 --> 28:35.061
I'm asking Jen if she actually
brought up to you that Lisa

28:35.104 --> 28:37.585
has had alleged affairs.

28:39.369 --> 28:41.807
- When we were in the hot tub.
- We talked about it.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.984
- Yeah, I said I heard rumors.
- I didn't bring it up.

28:45.027 --> 28:46.333
I didn't say specific to what.

28:46.376 --> 28:49.336
Jen said that she had heard
rumors of affairs.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.512
I confirmed that it was
the same thing I heard.

28:51.555 --> 28:54.994
I just kinda feel like
I've been put in the middle now.

28:55.037 --> 28:57.213
- Of what?
- What do you mean?

28:57.257 --> 28:58.998
I feel like you put me
in the middle.

28:59.041 --> 29:00.173
The reality is, Whitney,

29:00.216 --> 29:03.132
you had a lot more to say
than I did.

29:05.918 --> 29:07.397
I have a mutual friend
of Lisa's,

29:07.441 --> 29:10.661
and he's very wealthy
and very well known in Utah.

29:10.705 --> 29:16.276
And I heard that she slept
with him to sway him

29:16.319 --> 29:19.279
to invest in... her businesses.

29:19.322 --> 29:24.240
And I thought it was absurd,
too, but guess what?

29:26.242 --> 29:29.811
We were at a Jazz game
the other night,

29:29.855 --> 29:33.597
and John and Jack were sitting
in his seats--this man's seats.

29:33.641 --> 29:35.034
Wow.

29:35.077 --> 29:37.079
- Do you remember that?
- That doesn't matter.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.560
- Okay.
- But here's the thing.

29:39.603 --> 29:44.565
I don't feel like I can
authentically move forward

29:44.608 --> 29:47.046
if we don't put it all
on the table

29:47.089 --> 29:48.264
because now I feel bad.
Because--Because--

29:48.308 --> 29:49.700
No one's--
No one knew anything about that.

29:49.744 --> 29:51.224
- That's fine. Let's do it.
- But--But...

29:51.267 --> 29:53.835
- Jen agrees.
- I need you to say it

29:53.879 --> 29:56.098
because--
- I'm not saying it.

29:59.536 --> 30:00.799
- Tonight let's just keep quiet.
- Yeah.

30:00.842 --> 30:02.278
- Let's just go to bed.
- We gotta, like--Yeah.

30:02.322 --> 30:03.627
Let's eat, go to bed,
and just keep it--

30:03.671 --> 30:05.194
- I don't know where they are.
- Okay.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.848
Are they cooking the meat?
Where are they?

30:06.892 --> 30:09.677
Everyone knows if they tell me,
I'll be the one to say it.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.766
- I see where you're coming from.
- I'm--I'm coming

30:11.810 --> 30:12.985
from a place of strength.
- Where you're, like,

30:13.028 --> 30:14.160
"I want to stop being
Nancy Drew."

30:14.203 --> 30:15.422
- Yes.
- Because your intention...

30:15.465 --> 30:17.685
- Do you feel--Okay.
- ...is not what ends up,

30:17.728 --> 30:19.382
I feel like the perception
that happens.

30:19.426 --> 30:21.254
Exactly.

30:21.297 --> 30:25.214
Everyone is used to me being
Nancy Drew.

30:25.258 --> 30:28.348
I cannot... and... will... not...
know... more.

30:28.391 --> 30:31.264
But no one's asking you to, Whitney.

30:31.307 --> 30:32.831
No one's asking,
but everyone's expecting

30:32.874 --> 30:35.659
and dropping information...
- Whitney, that's--

30:35.703 --> 30:37.444
...and doing it all.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.794
What are you even
talking about?!

30:46.322 --> 30:48.455
- What's going on?
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

30:48.498 --> 30:51.066
Whitney, Whitney, what's wrong?

30:51.110 --> 30:53.112
- I'm done...
- With...

30:53.155 --> 30:54.504
...with bullsh--.

30:56.376 --> 30:58.944
What is going on?

30:58.987 --> 31:01.860
- What just happened out there?
- So I am trying--Just shut up.

31:01.903 --> 31:03.513
Please, everyone, shut up.

31:03.557 --> 31:06.821
Just let me get it out
in my own way.

31:19.094 --> 31:20.748
Whitney, Whitney, what's wrong?

31:20.791 --> 31:21.967
What is going on?

31:22.010 --> 31:24.056
Just shut up.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.666
Please, everyone, shut up.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.669
Just let me get it out
in my own way.

31:28.712 --> 31:31.890
I'm having a very hard time, Lisa,

31:31.933 --> 31:33.282
because for the first time

31:33.326 --> 31:36.068
in the entire time
I've known you,

31:36.111 --> 31:38.897
I feel like we have
a real friendship.

31:38.940 --> 31:40.811
I'm confused.

31:40.855 --> 31:44.554
What is happening right now
is I feel so conflicted

31:44.598 --> 31:48.907
because I have talked with
Meredith about your marriage,

31:48.950 --> 31:51.387
about rumors about you.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.000
Meredith brought it up.

31:55.043 --> 31:59.526
She came to <i>me</i>
with alleged rumors about you,

31:59.569 --> 32:01.963
and now I feel...
- I sat there with Whitney.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.922
- Let me clarify what I said...
- ...like I am in the middle.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.575
- ...before she--
- I feel like I'm in the middle,

32:05.619 --> 32:07.055
and I'm removing myself
out of it

32:07.099 --> 32:09.057
because this is not my fight.

32:09.101 --> 32:11.146
Retaliation is a----ing bitch.

32:11.190 --> 32:13.148
I'm in shock.

32:13.192 --> 32:14.845
Like, wow. Wow.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.370
I thought marriages
were off-limits, Meredith.

32:17.413 --> 32:19.415
I thought everything
with family's off-limits.

32:19.459 --> 32:20.764
It's like a power play for her.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.984
Whitney, thank you so much
for telling me that

32:23.028 --> 32:24.594
and being a good friend.
- I'm gonna get the salmon.

32:24.638 --> 32:26.074
There's nothing wrong
with my marriage.

32:26.118 --> 32:27.684
- There's no infidelity.
- Hold on a second.

32:27.728 --> 32:29.599
I'm happy and I love my family.
John and I are totally fine.

32:29.643 --> 32:34.082
Everybody, eat, and we'll talk
about it at dinner like adults.

32:34.126 --> 32:36.128
What was said about me?

32:40.262 --> 32:45.441
Um... it's rumored that
one of your

32:45.485 --> 32:48.314
that has the Jazz tickets that...

32:48.357 --> 32:50.359
I don't know which--

32:50.403 --> 32:51.752
...that you have been
involved with.

32:51.795 --> 32:55.277
- I don't wanna say the name.
- Are you crazy?!

32:55.321 --> 32:56.583
I'm not crazy. I'm saying--

32:56.626 --> 32:59.281
Oh, my God.

32:59.325 --> 33:01.675
That is disgusting.
That is disgusting!

33:01.718 --> 33:03.285
I am not the one
that started it!

33:03.329 --> 33:05.200
- Disgusting!
- I'm telling you what I heard.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.028
- Disgusting!
- It is disgusting, isn't it?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.769
- Yes.
- Disgusting. Disgusting.

33:08.812 --> 33:11.380
I heard it,
and I'm bringing it to you,

33:11.424 --> 33:13.469
and I'm asking you,
and you said no. It's done.

33:13.513 --> 33:15.341
Do you know that's someone
I look at that's like my father?

33:15.384 --> 33:17.082
I didn't tell her that.

33:17.125 --> 33:19.214
- She told <i>me</i> that.
- Whitney told <i>you</i> that?

33:19.258 --> 33:20.737
- Correct.
- This is someone that has, like,

33:20.781 --> 33:22.348
mentored me,
and we work together.

33:22.391 --> 33:24.002
I didn't tell her that.
I heard it from Whitney.

33:24.045 --> 33:27.309
I don't know why I'm even
involved in this right now.

33:27.353 --> 33:28.832
In fact, I never heard
these rumors

33:28.876 --> 33:30.486
other than from Whitney.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.315
I've heard other rumors, but not
the ones Whitney told me.

33:33.359 --> 33:35.274
Who repeated that rumor?
You or me?

33:35.317 --> 33:36.492
- I didn't know it.
- You told me...

33:36.536 --> 33:38.277
You started the rumor!

33:38.320 --> 33:40.061
...that she performed
sexual favors!

33:40.105 --> 33:43.673
Blowies for Jazz tickets?
I mean, that's a stretch.

33:43.717 --> 33:46.676
It's not like you were courtside
for the Lakers.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.157
I mean, blowies to sit
next to Jack Nicholson?

33:49.201 --> 33:53.988
Maybe a little more plausible,
but courtside at the Jazz,

33:54.032 --> 33:57.035
you don't have to get
on your knees for that.

33:57.078 --> 33:59.689
- I did not say that.
- Yes, you absolutely did.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.474
- I did not say that.
- I heard it,

34:01.517 --> 34:03.345
and you said, "Is that absurd?"

34:03.389 --> 34:04.477
What do <i>you</i> know?

34:04.520 --> 34:06.044
I just heard that she was,
you know,

34:06.087 --> 34:09.177
doing favors to help get places
to pick up Vida Tequila.

34:09.221 --> 34:10.787
It sounds absurd to me.

34:10.831 --> 34:13.964
Do you feel good?
Do you guys feel good?

34:17.272 --> 34:20.101
Does this feel----ing good?
Like,----ing hurt me more.

34:20.145 --> 34:23.104
Jen Shah who?

34:23.148 --> 34:24.932
Like, I'm fighting for my life
and my freedom,

34:24.975 --> 34:28.370
but y'all are fighting for
courtside Jazz ticket seats

34:28.414 --> 34:30.720
and who said what
and what rumors

34:30.764 --> 34:34.159
and who's a garbage trash whore
and who's not.

34:34.202 --> 34:39.642
The point here is that
the pain is between you two.

34:39.686 --> 34:41.296
I don't want you guys involved.

34:41.340 --> 34:43.211
I can handle things
with Meredith alone.

34:43.255 --> 34:44.560
And I said I would talk
to you directly.

34:44.604 --> 34:46.736
I didn't wanna talk about you
to anybody else

34:46.780 --> 34:48.912
because I never have,
and I didn't want to.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.131
Don't say you never have, Lisa,
because you have.

34:50.175 --> 34:52.699
Other than one----ing rant?!

34:52.742 --> 34:54.135
No, and I've heard about it
for years.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.311
Um... oh, whatever.
That's a lie. That's a lie.

34:56.355 --> 34:57.747
- That's a lie.
- So please stop lying to me.

34:57.791 --> 34:59.053
Call the people.
No, no, no, I'm not lying,

34:59.097 --> 35:01.011
and I'm not gonna be accused
of----ing lying.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.230
You know what?
You can not be perfect,

35:02.274 --> 35:04.058
and you can still forgive her.
- No.

35:04.102 --> 35:05.581
We just need to breathe.
Everybody, breathe.

35:05.625 --> 35:08.454
Everybody, let's do the...

35:10.064 --> 35:12.849
This is retaliation.
We are not involved,

35:12.893 --> 35:15.852
and you two need to work
this out.

35:15.896 --> 35:17.245
I don't know what's going on
with Whitney.

35:17.289 --> 35:18.812
She's like a runaway train.

35:18.855 --> 35:20.553
I know she's got a lot
on her heart and mind,

35:20.596 --> 35:25.297
but if Whitney is seeking peace
and truth and healing,

35:25.340 --> 35:28.561
stirring up trouble
is the opposite of that.

35:28.604 --> 35:29.953
Make it clear because
there's confusion here.

35:29.997 --> 35:31.346
I have said sorry,
and I am not gonna beg you

35:31.390 --> 35:32.956
for your friendship.
- You said that to me.

35:33.000 --> 35:34.567
- It is not happening.
- I did not say that to you.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.177
I am not gonna beg you
for your friendship.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.483
It was the first time
I heard it.

35:37.526 --> 35:38.745
I----ed up one time
in our friendship.

35:38.788 --> 35:40.181
- No, Lisa, it wasn't one time.
- One time!

35:40.225 --> 35:41.530
- You continue to say--
- It was one time, Meredith!

35:41.574 --> 35:43.010
- Stop yelling at me, Lisa.
- I have not--

35:43.053 --> 35:44.359
- I am not gonna calm down.
- I'm not--

35:44.403 --> 35:45.534
- Don't patronize me.
- Stop yelling at me.

35:45.578 --> 35:46.970
I'm gonna----ing scream
if I want to.

35:47.014 --> 35:48.407
I'm not yelling at you.
I'm yelling at this.

35:48.450 --> 35:49.451
Okay, scream. Then I'm not
communicating with you.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.800
I'm yelling because
I can't take it.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.280
Throwing things
and having a fit. I am calm.

35:52.324 --> 35:53.977
I'm gonna throw more sh--.
It doesn't make me psycho.

35:54.021 --> 35:55.805
- It makes me human.
- Okay, Lisa.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.198
- I'm done with this.
- Right.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.765
You wanna retaliate?
Go ahead and retaliate!

35:58.808 --> 36:00.462
I don't need your friendship.
If you don't wanna be

36:00.506 --> 36:01.507
my----ing friend, you're done.
- Wait. Who's retaliating?

36:01.550 --> 36:04.553
We're done.

36:04.597 --> 36:05.815
I just really don't know...

36:05.859 --> 36:08.253
how much more I can take.

36:11.952 --> 36:15.912
I have taken the brunt
of so... much.

36:17.392 --> 36:19.220
I need to call my husband.

36:33.887 --> 36:37.325
I have taken the brunt
of so... much.

36:39.893 --> 36:41.895
All I have is
John, Jack, and Henry.

36:41.938 --> 36:45.899
That is all I have!
That is all I have!

36:45.942 --> 36:48.075
John, Jack, and Henry
are my everything,

36:48.118 --> 36:53.123
and for someone to try
and hurt that is disgusting.

36:53.167 --> 36:56.083
I need to call my husband.
I have to go--No.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.917
All you have is your family.
Well, guess what?

37:03.960 --> 37:06.746
All <i>literally...</i>
literally all I have

37:06.789 --> 37:09.401
is my----ing husband
and my kids!

37:09.444 --> 37:12.230
Everything's been taken away
from me!

37:12.273 --> 37:13.666
Everything!

37:13.709 --> 37:16.582
I don't have anything else,
you guys.

37:16.625 --> 37:18.366
Way to go, cuz.

37:18.410 --> 37:21.761
Really, really knocked it
out of the park on this one.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.024
We've taken an already-frantic,
stressed-out woman...

37:24.067 --> 37:26.156
I don't have anything else.

37:26.200 --> 37:28.420
...and upped the ante.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.291
Meredith, Meredith, look at me.

37:30.335 --> 37:33.294
I own the things that I said.

37:33.338 --> 37:34.948
Well, not exactly,

37:34.991 --> 37:37.646
'cause you created
a little confusion there

37:37.690 --> 37:39.039
with her thinking <i>I</i> said that.

37:39.082 --> 37:40.910
I did not create confusion.
I said--

37:40.954 --> 37:42.303
You created
a little confusion.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.696
- Did I?
- You did.

37:43.739 --> 37:45.611
- Well, that's why--Okay.
- You created some confusion.

37:45.654 --> 37:47.308
Meredith,
you're absolutely right.

37:47.352 --> 37:48.309
Then go clear it up.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.615
- Clear it up?
- Go clear it up.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.628
You don't get to come in here.
I want you to go.

38:02.671 --> 38:04.020
I want you to go!
I want you to go.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.153
- You're not my friend.
- Lisa, I listened to you.

38:06.196 --> 38:08.547
No, I want you to go.
I have nothing to say to you.

38:08.590 --> 38:10.418
- Okay.
- I have nothing to say to you.

38:10.462 --> 38:14.161
I wanna say one thing to you,
and I wanna clear something up.

38:14.204 --> 38:17.338
I did not say anything
other than the fact

38:17.382 --> 38:20.254
that there <i>are</i> rumors out there,
and I didn't know

38:20.298 --> 38:21.734
if they were true or false.

38:21.777 --> 38:22.865
- You know that you're not--
- I didn't say--

38:22.909 --> 38:25.215
- Yeah.
- Let me finish.

38:25.259 --> 38:28.436
I did not say--that whole thing
that Whitney's talking about,

38:28.480 --> 38:30.177
she said--
I knew nothing about it.

38:30.220 --> 38:31.831
Let's go--
Let's go figure it out. Let's--

38:31.874 --> 38:33.398
- She will--Okay.
- I wanna hear about it.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.313
She'll answer you right now.

38:35.356 --> 38:37.793
I knew nothing about it
until she told me.

38:37.837 --> 38:39.491
So I couldn't have said it.

38:39.534 --> 38:43.233
Hey, Whitney, Whitney...

38:46.715 --> 38:48.021
- I did not.
- Okay.

38:48.064 --> 38:49.979
Meredith came to my home.
I invited her over.

38:50.023 --> 38:52.678
Whitney, go in there
and talk to her about it then.

38:52.721 --> 38:56.203
Meredith, you can't trust <i>me?</i>

38:56.246 --> 38:57.726
I'm not the one
going from house to house

38:57.770 --> 39:00.250
talking about <i>you</i>
behind your back.

39:00.294 --> 39:02.905
Can we just pause?
Like, like, like, like,

39:02.949 --> 39:05.778
mental health pause
for a second.

39:05.821 --> 39:07.562
Did you engage
in the negative conversations

39:07.606 --> 39:09.738
about me and my family?

39:09.782 --> 39:12.219
If the answer is yes,
you're at fault, too.

39:12.262 --> 39:14.700
It doesn't matter
who brought it up first.

39:14.743 --> 39:16.702
Did you shut it down,
or did you engage?

39:16.745 --> 39:18.791
Because that's your answer
right there.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.227
- Whitney, can I talk?
- Whitney! Whitney!

39:20.270 --> 39:21.750
- Just sit right here.
- Sorry. I'm trying to help.

39:21.794 --> 39:22.882
Whitney, it's not about us.
Come on. Just sit, baby.

39:22.925 --> 39:24.492
- I'm trying to help her.
- I know. I know.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.581
- I'm trying to help her.
- I know you are.

39:26.625 --> 39:31.412
I want to tell you what I said,
which was that there are rumors

39:31.456 --> 39:34.850
that pertain to basically
every area of your life

39:34.894 --> 39:36.722
that you spoke about mine.

39:39.246 --> 39:42.423
I did not speak
to any specific rumors.

39:42.467 --> 39:46.340
However, I should have just not
said anything at all.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.950
- Thank you. Thank you.
- And I was trying to understand

39:47.994 --> 39:50.170
what was going on,
and I should've said nothing,

39:50.213 --> 39:52.433
and I apologize.

39:52.477 --> 39:55.610
Thank you.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.090
I accept your apology.

39:57.133 --> 39:59.092
But every single----ing time
we're all together...

39:59.135 --> 40:00.702
- I know.
- ...it's a pile-on.

40:00.746 --> 40:02.269
And I take the brunt
of everything.

40:02.312 --> 40:03.923
When you had talks with her,
I got it all.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.669
I would never say it.

40:15.064 --> 40:16.370
It's not good for my kids.

40:16.414 --> 40:17.893
- It's not good for my husband.
- I know, but...

40:17.937 --> 40:21.288
Like, when I'm absorbing
so much--I'm an empath.

40:21.331 --> 40:23.856
- It's not--I know. Do you--
- I absorb it all.

40:23.899 --> 40:26.946
Why don't you take
a couple minutes?

40:26.989 --> 40:28.904
- Yeah, go to the bathroom.
- Take a couple deep breaths.

40:28.948 --> 40:33.692
And I'm coming to check on you
in... four minutes.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.955
I don't know why I said four.

40:35.998 --> 40:38.784
Not three and not five,
but four.

40:38.827 --> 40:41.482
I feel like you won't budge.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.876
- I won't budge on what?
- I gotta use the bathroom.

40:43.919 --> 40:47.488
You are the one who said
that you have heard

40:47.532 --> 40:51.405
that she is, in fact, a "whore."

40:51.449 --> 40:53.973
I said there are rumors
out there that pertain

40:54.016 --> 40:58.151
to that exact word.
That is correct.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.545
- What if Lisa's a whore?
- I don't----ing care.

41:00.588 --> 41:02.155
I'm wearing lingerie
for cowboy night right now.

41:02.198 --> 41:03.939
What if--What if Lisa
does blowjobs

41:03.983 --> 41:05.854
for Vida Tequila orders?
- Whitney, I don't understand

41:05.898 --> 41:07.377
what we're ar--
Am I missing something?

41:07.421 --> 41:09.118
Do you still wanna be friends
with Lisa?

41:09.162 --> 41:10.598
- We're saying the same thing.
- Okay.

41:10.642 --> 41:12.513
I'd give a blowjob for a burger.
I mean, I don't know.

41:12.557 --> 41:15.037
My bar's pretty low.

41:15.081 --> 41:16.909
I love you. I love myself, too.
I'm going to bed.

41:16.952 --> 41:18.650
- I know what's good for me.
- Okay.

41:18.693 --> 41:20.173
I'm going to bed.

41:20.216 --> 41:21.435
I am just sick of it, like,

41:21.479 --> 41:23.002
being thrown under the bus
'cause I'll say--

41:23.045 --> 41:24.656
But nobody threw you
under the bus, but I--

41:24.699 --> 41:26.832
- You did.
- I didn't.

41:26.875 --> 41:28.660
All I did was clear up

41:28.703 --> 41:31.140
because Heather was saying
that it was something <i>I</i> said.

41:31.184 --> 41:33.795
I didn't know. I didn't know.
I didn't know.

41:33.839 --> 41:35.449
- You owned it...
-'Cause you never told me...

41:35.493 --> 41:36.798
...and she misunderstood.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.321
So I thought Meredith
had told you.

41:38.365 --> 41:40.802
I have told you everything, Heather.

41:40.846 --> 41:42.978
We were at the Jazz game
with Angie.

41:43.022 --> 41:45.067
And you said,
"That's who Lisa's----ing"?

41:45.111 --> 41:47.243
- The guy in her seats?
- I didn't say it.

41:47.287 --> 41:53.423
You sat in the front two seats
on New Year's Eve with Angie.

41:53.467 --> 41:55.861
Angie told us
that John Barlow...

41:55.904 --> 41:57.645
- Babe, that was a we--
- ...and Lisa

41:57.689 --> 42:01.214
have those tickets because
Lisa sleeps with [bleep].

42:01.257 --> 42:04.609
That's how I heard it,
and you were there.

42:04.652 --> 42:06.741
- I did not hear it.
- You were there.

42:06.785 --> 42:09.265
I would tell you. It's a lie.

42:10.528 --> 42:13.574
If I knew it,
I would----ing say it.

42:13.618 --> 42:15.576
I have never heard it, and you
don't think I would love

42:15.620 --> 42:16.882
that information on her?

42:16.925 --> 42:18.448
- Did I--
- You are lying right now.

42:18.492 --> 42:21.669
- Tell me how!
- Because I stood courtside

42:21.713 --> 42:25.020
at the Jazz game with Angie,
and she told us that!

42:25.064 --> 42:26.718
- You're not with Lisa?
- I sat next to Angie and Chris.

42:26.761 --> 42:28.154
I'm gonna go check on her 'cause
I thought you were with her.

42:28.197 --> 42:30.504
And you were two rows back
on the other side.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.897
When did she say--

42:31.940 --> 42:34.595
Oh, when we were walking off
and taking a selfie,

42:34.639 --> 42:36.249
and she goes,

42:36.292 --> 42:38.686
"That's who Lisa sleeps with
for the Jazz tickets."

42:38.730 --> 42:40.209
- Wait, what?
- Well, guess what?

42:40.253 --> 42:42.255
I didn't hear
that----ing nugget!

42:42.298 --> 42:46.041
If I had, I would've...
- ed, too,

42:46.085 --> 42:47.521
'cause I love sitting courtside.

42:47.565 --> 42:51.264
you for calling me
a----ing liar!

42:51.307 --> 42:53.875
- You called me a liar.
- Goddamn you!

42:53.919 --> 42:56.399
<i>you!</i>

42:56.443 --> 42:59.751
me, please.
I love to be----ed.
