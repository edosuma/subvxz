WEBVTT

00:04.276 --> 00:05.474
This just breaking now.

00:05.551 --> 00:07.746
President Trump's campaign
manager Paul Manafort

00:07.823 --> 00:09.579
and his personal lawyer
Michael Cohen

00:09.656 --> 00:11.600
are each guilty
of eight criminal counts

00:11.677 --> 00:13.141
that will result in jail time.

00:13.218 --> 00:14.350
You know, I always thought

00:14.427 --> 00:16.412
this whole investigation
was a nothing burger,

00:16.489 --> 00:18.829
but now it's starting to
feel like a burger burger.

00:18.906 --> 00:20.995
Before this plane lands,
we need a response

00:21.072 --> 00:23.662
that isn't you pretending
you only speak Portuguese.

00:23.739 --> 00:25.292
You're being compared
to Nixon,

00:25.369 --> 00:28.454
and not just because of your
flop sweat and sexless marriage.

00:28.531 --> 00:29.857
Because of impeachment!

00:29.934 --> 00:32.558
Hello. You can't impeach
a sitting president.

00:32.636 --> 00:34.122
You're thinking
of "indict."

00:34.199 --> 00:35.542
Wrong.
I'm thinking of cake.

00:35.619 --> 00:37.919
Just stick to the message
that Cohen is a liar.

00:37.996 --> 00:40.124
Why am I dragging myself
into this?

00:40.201 --> 00:41.597
See ya at the hearings!

00:41.674 --> 00:43.980
Just get Giuliani,
tell him to pump himself

00:44.057 --> 00:46.318
full of Mountain Dew, sew
his mouth down the middle,

00:46.395 --> 00:48.151
and say two things
at the same time.

00:48.228 --> 00:50.666
Sir, do you think it's a good
idea to put Rudy on TV?

00:50.743 --> 00:52.329
Okay, Rudy's on TV,
everybody.

00:52.406 --> 00:55.151
There is no law in the jungle,
and that works okay.

00:55.228 --> 00:57.876
What, are you gonna throw all
the elephants behind bars?

00:57.953 --> 00:59.556
Prisons are crowded enough
as it is!

00:59.633 --> 01:02.794
Do you think Robert Mueller
would give me immunity?

01:02.871 --> 01:04.333
And more breaking news.

01:04.410 --> 01:06.255
During Michael Cohen's
guilty plea,

01:06.332 --> 01:08.929
he said he committed crimes
at the behest of the President.

01:09.006 --> 01:11.239
Oy.
Must be the turbulence

01:11.316 --> 01:12.926
and not the walls
closing in on me.

01:13.003 --> 01:14.403
Sir, are you feeling
all right?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.430
Oh, yeah. Uh, hey, is this
plane getting smaller?

01:17.517 --> 01:20.698
Because this fuselage feels like
a drinking straw.

01:20.775 --> 01:24.229
I hate to say the obvious,
but have we thought about a...

01:24.306 --> 01:26.393
War! Oh, my God!
Of course!

01:26.470 --> 01:27.761
What are you thinking?
Croatia?

01:27.838 --> 01:29.500
Iceland? They got
Muslims there, right?

01:29.577 --> 01:31.781
We'll find out when
we dig through the rubble.

01:31.858 --> 01:34.792
That's my cue. I can't lie
about what I don't know!

01:34.869 --> 01:37.226
Oh, God.
I need legal advice.

01:37.303 --> 01:39.805
You know who's just the lawyer
to help me out of this jam?

01:39.882 --> 01:42.085
Michael Cohen.
Darn it!

01:51.616 --> 01:54.469
America is full of

01:54.546 --> 01:57.668
Policemen, firefighters,
wounded veterans...

01:57.725 --> 02:01.388
And the oft-forgotten,
but most important of all,

02:01.428 --> 02:04.932
our glistening
'80s action movie stars!

02:04.939 --> 02:07.695
- Whoo!
- The movie? Bloodsport.

02:07.772 --> 02:09.639
The year? 1988.

02:09.717 --> 02:13.482
Elite American super soldier
Jean-Claude Van Damme

02:13.559 --> 02:16.234
is kicking the shit out of
some Chinese guys and...

02:16.311 --> 02:19.460
Sir, there's been a train
derailment outside Kansas City.

02:19.537 --> 02:22.234
Hello? I'm in the
middle of something!

02:22.311 --> 02:28.531
Anyways, put your hands together
for the stars of Bloodsport!

02:30.643 --> 02:35.172
I said, "Da-da-da-DAA!
Bloodsport!"

02:36.643 --> 02:40.539
I ask you to reunite one simple
kung-fu cast, and you don't.

02:40.616 --> 02:42.718
I ask you to make
the Blue Angels skywrite

02:42.795 --> 02:44.570
my security briefings,
and you don't.

02:44.647 --> 02:46.045
If you would like
to blame me, sir,

02:46.122 --> 02:48.788
I'm always looking for an
excuse to self-flagellate.

02:48.865 --> 02:50.336
Sir, we would do
what you say,

02:50.413 --> 02:52.882
but some of your quirkier ideas
either don't make sense

02:52.959 --> 02:54.628
or violate
the Geneva Conventions.

02:54.705 --> 02:57.663
Your job isn't to decide
if what I say makes sense.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.427
Your job is to do
what I say.

02:59.504 --> 03:00.968
If I say, "Jump,"
you say,

03:01.045 --> 03:02.688
"Here's the cast
of Bloodsport."

03:02.944 --> 03:05.875
President Trump's
Bloodsport fail

03:05.952 --> 03:07.351
has Americans wondering,

03:07.428 --> 03:10.903
"Will Trump's lack of control
collapse his administration?"

03:10.980 --> 03:13.280
Okay? And on the day
he leaves office,

03:13.357 --> 03:15.547
will I dissociate
from reality

03:15.624 --> 03:17.617
or finally take
that cooking class

03:17.694 --> 03:19.155
or a combination of the two

03:19.232 --> 03:20.976
that ends with
a Sur La Table chef

03:21.053 --> 03:23.317
wrestling a meat cleaver from
my hands? Watch this space.

03:23.394 --> 03:25.477
Melania!
What?

03:25.554 --> 03:28.778
I was right in the middle of
not spending time with you.

03:28.855 --> 03:31.398
Do you ever feel like
you're not in control?

03:31.475 --> 03:34.337
The last time I felt
in control was 1995

03:34.414 --> 03:36.440
when the stewardess
on my flight to America

03:36.517 --> 03:38.538
asked if I would like
chicken or pasta.

03:38.615 --> 03:40.690
My father controlled
everything I did...

03:40.767 --> 03:42.255
Which school I went to,

03:42.332 --> 03:44.773
which lead pipe I threatened
the tenants with,

03:44.850 --> 03:46.648
and I thought
it was my time.

03:46.725 --> 03:48.462
You're totally
in control.

03:48.539 --> 03:51.065
Then why does my staff ignore
my reasonable instructions

03:51.142 --> 03:53.399
to let Mike Ditka crash
in the Situation Room?

03:53.476 --> 03:54.765
I said you're
in control!

03:54.842 --> 03:57.242
Now go to sleep,
you big leathery baby!

03:57.471 --> 03:59.492
But I'm not tired!

04:00.327 --> 04:02.242
So, I'm watching
Bloodsport...

04:02.319 --> 04:04.014
Hannity's picture-in-picture,
of course,

04:04.091 --> 04:05.614
so he can watch
the movie, too...

04:05.691 --> 04:08.920
And I'm thinking, the sensei
tells Jean-Claude Van Damme

04:08.997 --> 04:10.794
to do something,
and he does it.

04:10.871 --> 04:12.474
If you guys did that for me,

04:12.551 --> 04:14.567
I'd promote all of you
to Vice President.

04:14.644 --> 04:16.865
I could use the help
appearing at funerals

04:16.942 --> 04:18.820
the deceased barred you
from attending.

04:18.897 --> 04:21.644
If you want to get your
administration under control,

04:21.721 --> 04:24.005
you got to supercharge
that military.

04:24.082 --> 04:25.474
- Oh, my God.
- Broken record.

04:25.551 --> 04:27.541
- Oh, Lordy.
- Hey, Rambo grew a mustache.

04:27.618 --> 04:28.883
John, you're a nut.

04:28.960 --> 04:30.348
Like I'm gonna
turn my government

04:30.425 --> 04:32.218
into some kind
of military regime.

04:32.295 --> 04:34.882
Hey, multiple generals,
get a load of this guy!

04:34.959 --> 04:35.994
I'm serious!

04:36.071 --> 04:38.411
Taxpayers pay for
black helicopters,

04:38.488 --> 04:40.973
and they deserve to see them
menacing their homes.

04:41.050 --> 04:42.679
Big talk coming
from someone

04:42.756 --> 04:44.245
who's never been
in a war.

04:44.322 --> 04:46.348
How am I supposed to
enjoy watching a war

04:46.425 --> 04:47.739
if I'm busy
being in it?

04:47.816 --> 04:50.226
I've thought about
this idea for 12 seconds,

04:50.303 --> 04:51.835
and I've decided
it's a no-go

04:51.912 --> 04:54.006
that's taking up
my precious mental energy.

04:54.083 --> 04:56.573
Now if you'll excuse me,
I got to play out a feud

04:56.650 --> 04:58.520
with Mandy Patinkin
in my head.

04:58.597 --> 05:00.919

05:00.996 --> 05:03.370

05:03.447 --> 05:06.485
And the ICE agent detained
the entire quinceañera

05:06.562 --> 05:08.595
before the first
slice of cake was cut.

05:08.672 --> 05:10.587
I wish I had
a bus that big!

05:10.664 --> 05:12.383
That's Fox & Friends
for this morning.

05:12.460 --> 05:14.227
Join us tomorrow
when we meet a man

05:14.304 --> 05:16.432
who paints the American flag
on people's houses

05:16.509 --> 05:17.808
whether they
like it or not.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.542
- And we're out.
- You won't believe

05:19.619 --> 05:20.805
what happened
to me last night.

05:20.882 --> 05:23.702
You gave your housekeeper the
night off for her birthday?

05:23.779 --> 05:26.667
I was in the Lower East Side
getting a late-night cup of joe

05:26.744 --> 05:27.790
so I could avoid sleep

05:27.867 --> 05:29.432
and the torturous dreams
that come with it.

05:29.509 --> 05:30.485
I hear that!

05:30.562 --> 05:33.292
But this SJW barista
wouldn't serve me,

05:33.369 --> 05:36.154
even though they'd only
been closed for 45 minutes!

05:36.231 --> 05:38.759
I yelled at her so hard,
you'd have thought she was

05:38.836 --> 05:40.389
a lesbian couple
not pulling out

05:40.466 --> 05:42.030
of a parking space
quick enough.

05:42.107 --> 05:44.235
And you know something?
It felt great!

05:44.312 --> 05:47.276
It's too bad we never get to
have violent tirades on air.

05:47.353 --> 05:48.711
I want to show my range...

05:48.788 --> 05:51.876
Everything from joyful sadism
to angry sadism.

05:51.953 --> 05:53.923
I don't even know
how to scream anymore.

05:54.000 --> 05:57.214
Aa-u-uh!
Is that the scream?

05:57.291 --> 05:59.577
Sir, it's time
we discuss the logistics

05:59.654 --> 06:00.953
of your
military parade.

06:01.030 --> 06:02.409
By "military," I meant

06:02.486 --> 06:04.798
the usual streamers
and sassy outfits,

06:04.875 --> 06:07.120
just with more people
tearfully saluting me.

06:07.197 --> 06:09.046
We've prepared
a half-dozen flyovers,

06:09.123 --> 06:12.078
a couple of military reunions,
all heterosexual, of course,

06:12.155 --> 06:14.680
and a float in honor of
Lee Greenwood's discography.

06:14.757 --> 06:16.848
Wow! Is there anything
left in the budget?

06:16.925 --> 06:18.360
$30 million.
Jesus!

06:18.437 --> 06:21.032
That's more than I'm wor...
A percentage of what I'm worth.

06:21.109 --> 06:22.989
It would be
quite the gesture

06:23.113 --> 06:25.071
to donate the rest
to the VA.

06:25.148 --> 06:27.196
Don't be cute.
Let's flood Dupont Circle

06:27.273 --> 06:29.015
and get some submarines
in there.

06:29.092 --> 06:30.626
Sir, to combat
protesters,

06:30.703 --> 06:32.428
we've lined the streets
with mace cannons,

06:32.505 --> 06:35.504
which we will demonstrate now
with a masochistic volunteer.

06:35.581 --> 06:39.543
I, an SJW, find violent
regime change triggering!

All right.
Sounds good.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.541
We've already injected
the military

09:13.618 --> 09:15.605
into everyday
American life...

09:15.682 --> 09:17.981
Camouflaged school
resource officers,

09:18.058 --> 09:21.731
camouflaged traffic police,
TSA agents in camo.

09:21.808 --> 09:23.479
But we can do more

09:23.556 --> 09:26.982
and urge Congress to pass
the Military Expansion Act,

09:27.059 --> 09:29.416
which would arm health
inspectors with hand grenades,

09:29.493 --> 09:31.012
teach toddlers
in swim classes

09:31.089 --> 09:33.401
how to silently rise from
the water with a knife

09:33.478 --> 09:35.502
between their teeth,
and so on.

09:35.579 --> 09:37.675
And the best part is
all orders

09:37.752 --> 09:40.333
will efficiently come
from the President, me!

09:40.410 --> 09:41.407
Whoo!

09:41.484 --> 09:43.547
I don't know this guy,
but I love him!

09:43.624 --> 09:47.479
With all due respect, get bent,

09:47.556 --> 09:50.813
I've never served my country,

09:50.890 --> 09:53.833
Hey, hey, hey, I get that
some of you might be nervous

09:53.910 --> 09:56.208
about irrevocably
altering our government.

09:56.285 --> 10:00.941
But let me reassure you,
dissenters will be executed.

10:01.847 --> 10:02.972
Whoo?

10:04.566 --> 10:06.327
Sean, our full-scale
military coup

10:06.404 --> 10:08.487
is bound to have
hippy-dippy dissenters,

10:08.564 --> 10:10.549
so I need media
reinforcement.

10:10.626 --> 10:11.761
Say no more.

10:11.838 --> 10:13.541
When one of your
newly armed teachers

10:13.618 --> 10:15.416
accidentally shoots
a class bird,

10:15.493 --> 10:19.151
I will do 90 minutes on the
Clinton Foundation's love affair

10:19.228 --> 10:20.962
- with al-Baghdadi.
- Perfect.

10:21.039 --> 10:24.040
Now, those Fox & Friends guys,
I love 'em to death,

10:24.117 --> 10:26.495
but they're not
exactly state-run TV.

10:26.572 --> 10:28.158
I need you to froth 'em up
for me, buddy.

10:28.235 --> 10:31.438
When I am done with them,
they'll be spewing fire

10:31.515 --> 10:33.708
and the occasional
national weather report.

10:33.785 --> 10:36.206
Oh, yeah, gotta have
the weather report.

10:36.923 --> 10:39.354
As requested for
your military parade,

10:39.431 --> 10:41.174
we're giving
the Washington Mall

Oh, what I wouldn't give
to nest in that nostril.

10:46.796 --> 10:48.667
Does PEZ come out
of the mouth?

10:48.744 --> 10:50.838
Shut up, Eric! Does PEZ
come out of it, Dad?

10:50.915 --> 10:52.925
If it doesn't,
someone screwed up.

10:53.002 --> 10:55.198
And why didn't we replace
the Lincoln Memorial

10:55.275 --> 10:56.855
with a bronze
of me in a hammock?

10:56.932 --> 10:59.598
For some reason, Congressional
Democrats blocked it, sir.

10:59.675 --> 11:02.846
You try and try
to be a good dictator,

11:14.251 --> 11:16.022
I found a puppy tied

Is your brain made of

I want you so fired up,
your viewers' dogs bark

11:38.118 --> 11:39.662
until they pass out!

11:39.739 --> 11:42.325
- So no more puffy language?

11:42.402 --> 11:43.965

11:49.082 --> 11:50.732
Finally!
Little lag there.

11:50.809 --> 11:53.144
Time to take my brain
to the Geek Squad.

11:53.221 --> 11:55.542
Don't worry about
Democratic resistance,

11:55.619 --> 11:57.660
Mr. President.
They've never heard of

11:57.737 --> 11:59.020
the burrito strategy.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.416
What's the
burrito strategy?

12:00.493 --> 12:02.782
I eat a burrito and then
I eat another burrito?

12:02.859 --> 12:05.699
Whenever Congress believes
our nation is under attack,

12:05.776 --> 12:07.630
they cede power
to the White House.

12:07.707 --> 12:09.838
Gulf of Tonkin,
USS Maine.

12:09.915 --> 12:13.409
We start this burrito fire
and let the revolution begin!

12:13.486 --> 12:15.535
Do I get to eat
the burrito afterward?

12:15.612 --> 12:18.754
- It'll be a pile of black ash.
- Answer the question.

12:18.831 --> 12:20.534
Okay, repeat after me.

12:20.611 --> 12:24.244
"I'm glad that immigrant doctor
was dragged off that bus!"

12:24.321 --> 12:25.896
I'm glad
that immigrant doctor

12:25.973 --> 12:27.416
was dragged off that bus!

12:27.493 --> 12:28.645
Ooh! Dr. Bus!

12:28.722 --> 12:31.129
Jesus, you're all
softer than a kitty cat

12:31.206 --> 12:33.364
choking on a dryer sheet...
So cute!

12:33.441 --> 12:35.724
We're trying, Sean,
but outwardly expressing

12:35.801 --> 12:38.089
our internalized anger
is so new to us.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.712
Our rage
is candy-coated.

12:39.789 --> 12:41.748
Our show is like
a fun airline.

12:41.825 --> 12:43.471
Our viewers are
the passengers,

12:43.548 --> 12:46.213
and I'm the stewardess
rapping about seat belts.

12:46.290 --> 12:49.178
Then let's do it "method."
Stanislavski!

12:49.255 --> 12:52.504
Doocy, you think of that
barista refusing you caffeine.

12:52.581 --> 12:54.442
Ainsley, think of
your employers

12:54.519 --> 12:56.466
accidentally
calling you "Greta."

12:56.543 --> 12:58.370
Brian, think
about thinking.

12:58.447 --> 13:00.100
Now try it again!

13:00.314 --> 13:02.050
I'm glad that immigrant
doctor was dragged off that bus!

13:02.127 --> 13:04.971
RUN THAT ILLEGAL OVER
WITH THE BUS!

13:05.048 --> 13:07.855
Like music to
my big, fat ears.

13:07.932 --> 13:09.771
Today's burrito fire

13:09.848 --> 13:12.082

13:12.159 --> 13:14.210
a crime against humanity

13:14.287 --> 13:18.337
surely committed by
a combination of ISIS, MS-13,

13:18.414 --> 13:21.235
and El Yummo Rico's
Frozen Chimichangas.

13:21.312 --> 13:23.243
To respond swiftly
and completely,

13:23.320 --> 13:25.498
we must fold all three
government branches

13:25.575 --> 13:29.035
into one big Trump galactic
military empire branch.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.219

13:41.148 --> 13:43.141
I am so sorry.

13:43.218 --> 13:47.071
I completely forgot you guys
don't support the troops.

13:47.148 --> 13:49.213
Oh, no.
The troops? Of course we do.

13:49.290 --> 13:50.618
Son of a bitch.

13:50.695 --> 13:53.081

I-I swear to God!

13:53.158 --> 13:54.910

noble, fashion-forward

14:39.081 --> 14:42.994
Commander-in-Chief himself,
Donald J. Trump!

14:45.409 --> 14:47.621
Everyone's finally
listening to me,

14:47.698 --> 14:50.350
and not just because they have
a tank pointed at their heads.

14:50.427 --> 14:53.455
Now, who wants to fire a cannon
and see what happens?!

14:58.249 --> 15:01.768
Holy shit! We blew up
the Library of Congress!

15:03.266 --> 15:07.430
I am just so happy that America
is on the path to peace,

15:07.507 --> 15:10.252
the peace that comes
with death.

15:10.467 --> 15:13.821
Very soon we will march
our armies across the globe

15:13.898 --> 15:15.523
for a new cold war.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.416
Trench foot's back, baby,
and it's smellier than ever!

15:23.111 --> 15:25.038
That was the
best day of my life

15:25.115 --> 15:26.970
since I paid off
that drone pilot

15:27.047 --> 15:29.616
to vaporize my neighbor's
gaudy deck umbrella.

15:29.693 --> 15:31.632
Hey, John,
all that war stuff?

15:31.709 --> 15:34.401
It was just some harmless
violent mob stoking, right?

15:34.686 --> 15:36.318
Nope! The plan's
always been

15:36.395 --> 15:38.924
to fit every single
American with a uniform

15:39.001 --> 15:41.570
then invade the planet.
Oh. Okay.

15:41.647 --> 15:44.450
I kinda thought this was to get
my staff to listen to me.

15:44.527 --> 15:47.251
We did listen to you,
and that's why high schools

15:47.328 --> 15:49.588
now only offer one
foreign-language class...

15:49.665 --> 15:50.692
Wind-talking.

15:50.769 --> 15:52.013
But isn't war muddy?

15:52.090 --> 15:54.396
I mean, everyone's trying
to save Matt Damon,

15:54.473 --> 15:56.135
but they get
the wrong Matt Damon,

15:56.212 --> 15:58.239
then you run out of popcorn
in the middle of the war,

15:58.316 --> 15:59.507
and you have to go get more,

15:59.584 --> 16:02.328
but they stopped making
popcorn at 10:45 p.m.

16:02.405 --> 16:04.346
Basically,
isn't war hell?

16:04.423 --> 16:06.318
- War.
- War!

16:06.395 --> 16:08.057
- War!
- War!

16:08.134 --> 16:09.718

16:21.067 --> 16:23.960
Hey, guys, is anyone
feeling a little on edge?

16:24.037 --> 16:25.862
Yeah.
To get out all my anger,

16:25.939 --> 16:28.171
I had to join a backyard
wrestling league.

16:28.248 --> 16:30.781
I chased down Ainsley's
new dog and ate it.

16:30.858 --> 16:32.516
So that's how he died.

16:32.593 --> 16:34.039
Yes, I ate the dog.

16:34.116 --> 16:35.839
I thought I would
like being angry,

16:35.916 --> 16:37.843
but it's turning me
into a real wackadoodle.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.320
I miss calling
Kirsten Gillibrand a Muslim

16:40.397 --> 16:43.138
with a smile so big,
my veneers fuse.

16:44.613 --> 16:47.313
We all agree we should bomb
the Middle East,

16:47.390 --> 16:48.809
but did you know
there's a place

16:48.886 --> 16:51.611
with even more resources
and villagers?

16:51.688 --> 16:54.744
China! It's time they
answer for our debts.

16:54.821 --> 16:56.733
What the hell
are you suggesting?

16:56.810 --> 16:58.580
Asian Invasion,
baby!

16:58.657 --> 17:00.731
It makes sense,
and it rhymes,

17:00.808 --> 17:02.809
so you know we're gonna
sell a ton of merch.

17:02.886 --> 17:05.627
China? I-Isn't that where
Bloodsport was filmed?

17:05.704 --> 17:07.603
Hey, Donald, why
don't you wait outside

17:07.680 --> 17:09.324
until we finish
planning this war?

17:09.401 --> 17:11.983
Then we'll invite you back in
when the pens come out.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.114
I wanna stay!

17:13.191 --> 17:15.252
And I want to
invade China.

17:15.329 --> 17:18.244
We can't all have what
we want, except for me.

17:18.321 --> 17:21.378
And although his hot tub
might be full of algae,

17:21.455 --> 17:22.979
that old man
found solace

17:23.056 --> 17:25.064
knowing his pool boy
was deported.

17:25.141 --> 17:28.368
When we come back, your son
looks completely normal.

17:28.445 --> 17:29.385
Is he on drugs?

17:29.462 --> 17:30.814
And the
Liberty University

17:30.891 --> 17:33.533
Straight Men's Choir
sings a requiem to my dog.

17:33.610 --> 17:34.976
- I ate the dog.
- Clear!

17:35.053 --> 17:36.598
- What the hell was that?!
- Ainsley,

17:36.675 --> 17:38.892
you barely talked
above 60 decibels!

17:38.969 --> 17:41.450
And, Doocy, when you said,
"Michael Avenatti

17:41.527 --> 17:42.947
is holding
Desmond Tutu hostage,"

17:43.024 --> 17:45.111
your face didn't
even turn gray!

17:45.188 --> 17:47.601
Sean, we decided
we have to do us,

17:47.678 --> 17:50.283
which is you but with
less-dilated pupils.

17:50.360 --> 17:54.039
I berated demeaning
instructions at you for hours,

17:54.116 --> 17:55.791
and this is how
you repay me?!

17:55.868 --> 17:57.853
Are you gonna shatter
that camera lens

17:57.930 --> 17:59.781
with conspiracy-fueled
screaming,

17:59.858 --> 18:01.978
or should I find
three other stooges

18:02.055 --> 18:04.630
to be the President's
daytime mouthpiece?!

18:05.645 --> 18:07.510
I have my answer.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.423
Good luck to you all.

18:09.500 --> 18:11.088
Aw! Good luck!

18:12.209 --> 18:15.315
All I wanted was a little
more control in my life,

18:15.392 --> 18:17.010
and what I got
was a World War

18:17.087 --> 18:18.890
with the people
who make my ties.

18:18.967 --> 18:20.855
My poor little ties.

18:20.932 --> 18:24.031
You thought the nation was just
gonna lift a bunch of weights

18:24.108 --> 18:27.040
and not want to punch a sleeping
homeless person on the subway?

18:27.117 --> 18:29.847
Tell you what, we wipe
China off the map,

18:29.924 --> 18:31.808
and afterwards,
if you don't like it,

18:31.885 --> 18:33.198
we'll never do it again.

18:33.275 --> 18:35.913
I said no! And you
have to listen to me!

18:35.990 --> 18:38.023
I'm the
Commander-in-Chief.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.425
No. I'm the
Commander-in-Chief.

18:40.502 --> 18:42.465
Look.
Huh! Nice try, John.

18:42.542 --> 18:45.135
I've looked at every reflective
surface I've ever passed,

18:45.212 --> 18:46.531
so I know
that's a mirror.

18:46.608 --> 18:48.902
The wheels of war
are turning,

18:48.979 --> 18:51.657
and if you want to stop them,
it's going to take work.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.683
Is that what
you want? Work?

18:53.760 --> 18:55.639
No. I guess not.

19:00.935 --> 19:03.291
Sir, I got a new stack
of war declarations

19:03.368 --> 19:04.907
for you to consider.
This one would

19:04.984 --> 19:07.733
flatten Germany, justified by their
previous track record.

19:07.810 --> 19:09.546
And this one's to
napalm Mt. Everest

19:09.623 --> 19:11.600
and make the unrecognized
state of Tibet

19:11.677 --> 19:12.966
even more
unrecognizable.

19:13.043 --> 19:14.749
Why can't we just do
a civil war?

19:14.826 --> 19:15.999
Everyone's already armed,

19:16.076 --> 19:18.085
people could still have dinner
with their families.

19:18.162 --> 19:20.549
Ugh, Sarah, can you
get me some KFC?

19:20.626 --> 19:23.441
Unfortunately, they've become
a weapons manufacturer...

19:23.518 --> 19:25.551
"Kentucky Fieldwork
Cluster-munitions."

19:25.628 --> 19:26.933
If it's any consolation,

19:27.010 --> 19:29.096
they still have the same code
to use their bathroom.

19:29.173 --> 19:30.884
You don't need those guys!
You don't need 'em!

19:30.961 --> 19:32.330
You're Stevie Nicks, baby.

19:32.407 --> 19:35.314

Three white

19:39.094 --> 19:40.533
It's Fox & Friends.

19:40.610 --> 19:42.822
Welcome back to Fox & Friends.

19:42.899 --> 19:44.449
That's right! It's Hannity!

19:44.526 --> 19:46.931
And filling in for
those bloodless traitors

19:47.008 --> 19:49.491
are my spiritually
conjoined twins,

19:49.568 --> 19:52.157
Sebastian Gorka

19:52.234 --> 19:55.323
Good dawn, Sean!
It is I, Gorka!

19:55.400 --> 19:57.385
Sunlight is poison,
okay?!

19:57.462 --> 20:00.924
And my Alpha Power pills
are the only cure!

20:01.001 --> 20:03.250
Temperate weather today
in the Northeast,

20:03.327 --> 20:05.511
all but confirming
that "Climate Change"

20:05.588 --> 20:08.963
is a liberal myth perpetuated
by Janeane Garofalo!

20:09.040 --> 20:10.618
I'll go one further, Sean,

20:10.695 --> 20:13.118
and say mild weather
is the beginning

20:13.195 --> 20:16.699
of the long-prophesied
solar flare of Attila

20:16.776 --> 20:20.546
that will darken and cool
the Earth for a thousand annus!

20:20.623 --> 20:24.249
Seasons are a simulation,
the equator is flat,

20:24.326 --> 20:26.835
and the Earth
is a spinning disk

20:26.912 --> 20:29.767
that will soon be engulfed
by interdimensional warlocks!

20:29.844 --> 20:33.111
We have confirmation
from reddit's manga page!

20:33.188 --> 20:34.752
Whew!
Pace yourself, guys.

20:34.829 --> 20:36.321
We got three hours.
Come on.

21:46.741 --> 21:47.918

21:47.995 --> 21:49.122
He doesn't listen!

21:49.199 --> 21:51.288
He's always yapping...
"Bomb Iran"

21:51.365 --> 21:53.252
and "Too late;

21:53.329 --> 21:56.477
Mr. President, you can have
all the bombs in the world...

21:56.554 --> 21:58.697
And we pretty much have
for the last hundred years...

21:58.774 --> 22:00.909
But that doesn't
make you in control.

22:00.986 --> 22:02.573
What do you know
about the military?

22:02.650 --> 22:04.231
I was in
the military.

22:04.308 --> 22:05.699
What?
You never mentioned that.

22:05.776 --> 22:07.268
I absolutely have.

22:07.345 --> 22:10.315
And despite how it appears, we
have even less control than you.

22:10.392 --> 22:12.545
You know how many times
I've tried to drone a hospital

22:12.622 --> 22:14.530
and ended up droning
the wrong hospital?

22:14.607 --> 22:16.455
Right.
I mean, I like guns,

22:16.532 --> 22:18.392
and I like when things
come out of guns.

22:18.469 --> 22:21.371
But when it hits the guy?
I don't know. It's scary.

22:21.448 --> 22:23.470
Great point,
Mr. President.

22:23.547 --> 22:26.712
The only way to
truly feel in control

22:26.789 --> 22:29.294
is to control yourself.

22:29.539 --> 22:32.066
Kelly, I'm not sure
if you still work for me,

22:32.143 --> 22:33.934
but if you do,
I'm glad.

22:34.011 --> 22:35.197
Hannity,
you're on in five.

22:35.274 --> 22:38.139
Sean, I suggest we skip
the weather segment

22:38.216 --> 22:41.354
and cut straight
to my musings on jihad!

22:41.431 --> 22:43.122
What the hell are
you doing, Sean?

22:43.199 --> 22:45.791
Aw, Sean, turn that
frown inside out

22:45.868 --> 22:47.816
and make your gums
your lips.

22:47.893 --> 22:49.176
What are you
doing here?

22:49.253 --> 22:51.411
We watched the show
over white jazz brunch.

22:51.488 --> 22:52.979
We could tell
that by minute 30

22:53.056 --> 22:55.338
you were in the midst
of a psychological breakdown.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.038
My schtick just doesn't
work at 6:00 a.m.

22:58.115 --> 23:00.382
People need an entire
miserable day

23:00.459 --> 23:02.060
to build up to my rage.

23:02.137 --> 23:03.984
Sean, we owe you
an apology.

23:04.061 --> 23:06.221
When you encouraged us
to surrender our brains

23:06.298 --> 23:07.788
to the will of
an erratic leader,

23:07.865 --> 23:09.602
we thought,
"What could go wrong?"

23:09.679 --> 23:12.154
The answer was our emotional
well-being and nothing else.

23:12.231 --> 23:14.507
You know, we're two sides
of the same nickel.

23:14.584 --> 23:16.513
Your side is just
a little more polished,

23:16.590 --> 23:19.602
and my side has Thomas Jefferson
and everything he represents.

23:19.679 --> 23:21.622
Why don't we go back to
doing what we do best?

23:21.699 --> 23:22.907
Journalism!

23:24.250 --> 23:27.400
Just read exactly
what the prompter says,

23:27.477 --> 23:30.620
and you'll finally
be in control.

23:32.523 --> 23:33.842
And now, a message

23:33.919 --> 23:35.907
from the President
of the United States.

23:35.984 --> 23:39.228
My fellow Americans,
I declare...

23:39.339 --> 23:40.985
I declare...

23:41.062 --> 23:43.109
I... I...

23:43.505 --> 23:45.027
I can't do this.

23:45.104 --> 23:47.740
There are many valid
reasons to go to war...

23:47.817 --> 23:51.485
Cheap oil, natural-gas reserves,
untapped petroleum...

23:51.562 --> 23:53.683
But we weren't going to war
for those reasons.

23:53.760 --> 23:56.589
We were going
because I wanted control,

23:56.671 --> 23:59.006
but a mushroom cloud,
though it might look pretty

23:59.083 --> 24:01.615
and sound tasty, isn't control.

24:01.692 --> 24:04.698
True control
is controlling yourself,

24:04.775 --> 24:08.072
and I am in con...
