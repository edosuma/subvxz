WEBVTT

00:08.571 --> 00:11.106
What do you call that,
stupid on a plate?

00:17.046 --> 00:18.480
Ah.

00:18.548 --> 00:20.148
Hi.

00:20.216 --> 00:21.817
Long night, Gillian?

00:21.884 --> 00:23.085
What are you doing here, Cal?

00:23.153 --> 00:24.320
I thought you hated this place.

00:24.388 --> 00:25.489
No, it's the best breakfast
in town, this one.

00:25.856 --> 00:27.057
You don't even eat breakfast.

00:27.124 --> 00:28.358
A man can change.
Hmm.

00:28.426 --> 00:30.560
So you're not here
to pry, then?

00:30.628 --> 00:31.728
What, me, pry?
Yeah.

00:31.796 --> 00:34.331
On you, in here? Never.

00:34.398 --> 00:36.600
I'd have thought
he'd be bringing you

00:36.667 --> 00:38.501
granola in bed by now.

00:38.569 --> 00:41.404
Mmm, close enough.

00:41.472 --> 00:43.306
How you doing, Dave?

00:43.374 --> 00:45.742
Lightman. Why don't you
grab that table?

00:45.810 --> 00:47.777
Yeah, 'cause you don't
want to miss this.

00:47.845 --> 00:49.112
I'll see you at the office.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.114
Not if I see you first.

00:51.182 --> 00:52.315
Dave: Enjoy your eggs.

00:52.383 --> 00:54.784
Oh, I will.

01:01.692 --> 01:02.792
Babe, I gotta take this.

01:02.860 --> 01:04.494
It's one of the kids
from juvie.

01:04.562 --> 01:05.729
Hello?

01:05.796 --> 01:08.565
I can't hear you.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.600
I'll take it outside.

01:10.668 --> 01:12.469
Ok.

01:14.000 --> 01:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:44.068 --> 01:46.136
You've got to get out of here,
you've got to disappear!

01:46.203 --> 01:47.671
Do you understand?

01:57.481 --> 01:59.916
Where is Captain America, then?

01:59.984 --> 02:01.785
He's working.

02:01.852 --> 02:03.820
Oh, right.

02:03.888 --> 02:05.655
Is there a secret

02:05.723 --> 02:07.891
that you're keeping for him?

02:07.958 --> 02:10.393
You just can't
help yourself, can you?

02:10.461 --> 02:12.462
No, when it comes
to you, I can't.

02:12.530 --> 02:14.330
I work for the DEA.

02:14.398 --> 02:17.100
Oh, bulls-eye.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.668
In the juvenile facility,

02:18.736 --> 02:20.870
collecting information
on a key drug corridor.

02:20.938 --> 02:23.139
What you're picking up on are lies

02:23.207 --> 02:26.576
necessary for me to do my job.

02:28.846 --> 02:31.614
Right.

02:36.420 --> 02:38.088
Wow.

02:38.155 --> 02:39.923
I'm sorry.

02:41.726 --> 02:43.226
Cal: So you see that
girl over there, right?

02:43.294 --> 02:44.894
Ben: Yeah, I see her.

02:44.962 --> 02:46.996
She was telling
Burns to leave town.

02:47.064 --> 02:48.164
All last night,

02:48.232 --> 02:50.467
she sat outside Burns' house

02:50.534 --> 02:51.835
with a gun in her lap,

02:51.902 --> 02:55.238
while Foster was
sleeping inside.

02:56.774 --> 02:58.374
You think she's DEA?
I don't know.

02:58.442 --> 03:00.777
Maybe he's just
fooling around on Foster.

03:00.845 --> 03:04.614
He's a very naughty boy.

03:08.786 --> 03:10.887
Hey!

03:17.228 --> 03:18.461
Get in.

03:18.529 --> 03:21.331
Didn't expect to see you
again, huh, Marco?

03:23.667 --> 03:25.034
Hey!

03:25.102 --> 03:27.003
Hey, hey!

03:27.071 --> 03:29.672
We need an airship in pursuit

03:29.740 --> 03:31.007
of a white and gray van.

03:31.075 --> 03:33.777
Bravo, delta, 312 Henry.

03:33.844 --> 03:36.112
Foster's going to kill me.

04:18.956 --> 04:21.423
You mean me, my feelings.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.592
You want me to handle this,
or do you...

04:22.660 --> 04:24.260
You have done enough already.

04:24.328 --> 04:25.461
Look, if I hadn't
have been on this, right,

04:25.529 --> 04:27.530
Burns would have
just gone "poof!"

04:27.598 --> 04:30.667
And then nobody would have
been any the wiser, so...

04:30.734 --> 04:31.935
Dr. Lightman,
Dr. Foster,

04:32.002 --> 04:34.003
this is Agent
Williams of the DEA.

04:34.071 --> 04:35.338
Good morning.
How do you do?

04:35.406 --> 04:36.739
Before we start, I want to

04:36.807 --> 04:37.907
thank you in advance

04:37.975 --> 04:39.242
on behalf of the drug
enforcement agency

04:39.310 --> 04:40.777
for your expertise in this.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.846
I believe Agent Reynolds
has brought you up to speed

04:42.913 --> 04:45.515
on our progress since Agent
Burns' abduction last night.

04:45.583 --> 04:48.017
Any demands so far?

04:48.085 --> 04:49.252
Not as of yet, no.

04:49.320 --> 04:51.354
He thinks some of the kids
from juvie are involved.

04:51.422 --> 04:52.422
Yeah, we got four from in the cube

04:52.489 --> 04:53.623
waiting for you.

04:53.691 --> 04:55.992
No, you can crack those kids
on your own dime.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.228
I'm...

04:58.295 --> 05:00.630
Far more interested

05:00.698 --> 05:03.266
in this.

05:07.204 --> 05:09.739
Now that is a look
I'd like to know more about.

05:09.807 --> 05:12.342
Do you know who this woman is?

05:15.679 --> 05:18.081
That was taken last night.

05:18.148 --> 05:19.015
She was with him last night?

05:19.083 --> 05:20.483
You didn't tell me that!

05:20.551 --> 05:22.285
I was going to tell you,
I was going to tell you.

05:24.788 --> 05:27.123
You see that look
on Burns' face?

05:27.191 --> 05:29.859
All right,
that's fear, that is.

05:29.927 --> 05:32.528
You want to talk to me
about it, or you...

05:32.596 --> 05:36.566
I suppose I'll just have to ask
her myself, then, won't I?

05:36.634 --> 05:38.801
I'd have to get clearance.
We scoff

05:38.869 --> 05:41.371
at words like that around here.
Don't we, Ben?

05:41.438 --> 05:43.706
No, we laugh our asses off.

05:43.774 --> 05:47.410
What's her name,
Agent Williams?

05:47.478 --> 05:50.079
I'll let her tell you that.

05:50.147 --> 05:52.548
I'm not going
to explain myself.

05:52.616 --> 05:53.683
You don't have to.

05:53.751 --> 05:56.219
Look, I get it,
you're cross at me.

05:56.287 --> 05:57.820
But I was doing the
right thing, you know.

05:57.888 --> 05:59.923
I was looking at Burns.
Well, behind your back.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.557
Which, by the way,
only makes it worse.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.493
Dr. Lightman,
ship's leaving.

06:03.560 --> 06:04.894
Whoopty-doo.

06:04.962 --> 06:07.797
No more secrets, right?

06:07.865 --> 06:09.699
Prove it.

06:09.767 --> 06:11.601
All right, you know my
mom's birthday, right?

06:11.669 --> 06:14.604
All right, you know what
I'm talking about then.

06:14.672 --> 06:18.441
Ok. Then
do you know...

06:18.509 --> 06:20.743
Apology accepted.

06:20.811 --> 06:22.979
Great, thanks.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.418
His mother's birthday.

06:32.957 --> 06:35.491
He's probably going
to change it now.

06:52.643 --> 06:55.878
Lightman's been keeping
a file on Burns.

06:55.946 --> 06:57.513
Why?
3 guesses...

06:57.581 --> 06:59.882
Foster, Foster and Foster.

07:03.253 --> 07:05.588
That's fear in Burns' face.

07:05.656 --> 07:09.058
No more secrets.

07:11.795 --> 07:14.530
Agent Williams:
You got 20 minutes.

07:19.069 --> 07:22.872
What's a nice girl like you
doing in a place like this, eh?

07:22.940 --> 07:24.974
Who said anything about nice?

07:25.042 --> 07:27.310
How'd you know Burns?

07:27.378 --> 07:29.345
Dave and I worked undercover.

07:29.413 --> 07:30.613
Up till 3 months ago.

07:30.681 --> 07:33.483
You're partners?
Ex-partners.

07:33.550 --> 07:35.885
We lost touch when he was
reassigned a few months back.

07:35.953 --> 07:37.520
And the rest?

07:37.588 --> 07:39.389
Trying to find him.

07:39.456 --> 07:41.624
Why? Because you think you might be
responsible for what happened to him?

07:41.692 --> 07:43.993
Who the hell are you
to ask that type of...

07:44.061 --> 07:45.128
is that guilt, is it?

07:45.195 --> 07:46.162
Guilt?

07:46.230 --> 07:47.363
No.

07:47.431 --> 07:48.965
Fear.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.200
Well, I think
you might be next.

07:52.936 --> 07:56.706
All right, that's the small
talk out of the way.

07:57.875 --> 08:01.411
His name is little moon,
the man who took him.

08:01.478 --> 08:02.979
He's a boy, really.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.514
Street name?

08:04.581 --> 08:06.082
About 3 months ago,

08:06.150 --> 08:07.617
drug wholesaler named big moon

08:07.684 --> 08:09.285
turned up in a dumpster.

08:09.353 --> 08:11.220
Moon and son. They keep it
in the family, do they?

08:11.288 --> 08:13.322
Little moon was just a
nothing when it happened.

08:13.390 --> 08:15.124
Then he stepped up his game.

08:15.192 --> 08:16.692
Got a gun.

08:16.760 --> 08:19.829
Why were you talking
to Burns a few days back?

08:19.897 --> 08:21.964
Trying to warn him.

08:22.032 --> 08:24.467
You know, with some people,

08:24.535 --> 08:26.402
it's easier to tell when they
stop lying than when they start.

08:26.470 --> 08:27.703
I think you're one of them.

08:27.771 --> 08:30.373
How can you tell
when I stop lying?

08:30.441 --> 08:32.408
You shut your mouth.

08:34.211 --> 08:37.780
I might know a guy who used
to do business with big moon.

08:37.847 --> 08:40.249
He was big moon's former boss.

08:40.317 --> 08:42.952
He might know where
his son's holding Burns.

08:51.228 --> 08:54.297
Hey, Michelle.

08:54.364 --> 08:57.500
How you doing, sweetheart?

09:00.537 --> 09:02.138
What's up?

09:02.206 --> 09:04.273
Who's your friend?

09:04.341 --> 09:06.109
I'm a scientist.

09:06.176 --> 09:08.111
You know that guy I used
to run with, Gianelli?

09:08.178 --> 09:10.046
He's a cop.

09:11.115 --> 09:12.548
He is?

09:12.616 --> 09:15.151
Bullocks,
you already knew that.

09:16.687 --> 09:18.387
He reads faces.

09:18.455 --> 09:20.256
They got a name for that
where I come from.

09:20.324 --> 09:22.425
Common sense.
Well, my common sense

09:22.493 --> 09:26.529
is telling me that you've already
busted Burns as undercover.

09:26.597 --> 09:28.998
Well, he's not the only one.
Really?

09:29.066 --> 09:31.100
Yeah.

09:31.168 --> 09:35.538
I didn't know they gave coke
whores badges nowadays.

09:35.606 --> 09:38.407
You think I'm a cop?

09:38.475 --> 09:41.577
Well, you were
the closest to him.

09:41.645 --> 09:44.614
What's his name now?
Gianelli? Burns.

09:44.681 --> 09:45.781
Burns.

09:45.849 --> 09:48.184
Little moon's been
following you.

09:48.252 --> 09:51.554
You met with the guy 3
times in the last week.

09:51.622 --> 09:54.290
What's that about?

09:55.392 --> 09:57.393
I shouldn't be here.

09:57.461 --> 09:58.694
Well, if you really
wanted to leave,

09:58.762 --> 10:00.463
your hips would be
under that door.

10:00.531 --> 10:03.032
Question is, why aren't they?

10:03.100 --> 10:06.002
You outted my partner.

10:07.371 --> 10:08.905
Well, that answers that.

10:08.972 --> 10:12.108
You know, we all wondered
how a pretty girl like you

10:12.176 --> 10:16.579
became tangled with a paper
gangster like Marco Gianelli.

10:16.647 --> 10:19.782
Hands where I can see them.

10:20.884 --> 10:22.185
She meant that.

10:22.252 --> 10:23.519
It's gotta be hard

10:23.587 --> 10:26.088
to keep things straight
in your head

10:26.156 --> 10:28.524
after all the things
you've done.

10:28.592 --> 10:30.693
If you don't shut your mouth,

10:30.761 --> 10:32.528
she will shut it for you.

10:32.596 --> 10:34.497
She's not going to shoot me.

10:34.565 --> 10:36.465
You think so?
No.

10:36.533 --> 10:38.067
Hands where I can see them.

10:38.135 --> 10:40.469
Hop up on my lap, sweetie, huh?

10:40.537 --> 10:42.205
I'll give you a little powder.

10:42.272 --> 10:44.407
For old time's sake.

10:47.311 --> 10:49.879
While you were watching his
face, I was watching his hands!

10:51.682 --> 10:54.317
That's your tax dollars
at work, mate.

10:54.384 --> 10:56.419
He has a gun.

10:59.056 --> 11:01.857
No, he doesn't.

11:04.127 --> 11:05.528
Right, my common sense
just saved your life,

11:05.596 --> 11:06.662
so you owe me.

11:06.730 --> 11:07.930
I want to talk to half moon.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.900
Or whatever it is that
he's calling himself.

11:14.871 --> 11:17.406
Yeah.

11:17.474 --> 11:19.875
I got someone here
who wants to speak to you.

11:19.943 --> 11:21.711
You're gonna listen to him.

11:21.778 --> 11:23.479
Do you understand?

11:25.315 --> 11:27.183
Hello?

11:27.251 --> 11:28.951
Cal Lightman here.

11:29.019 --> 11:30.786
We know who you are,
Dr. Lightman.

11:30.854 --> 11:34.390
Your boy here Burns
told us all about you.

11:34.458 --> 11:35.858
What did he tell you?

11:35.926 --> 11:37.927
Not nearly enough.

11:37.995 --> 11:39.929
You know who I am,
you know what I do.

11:39.997 --> 11:42.331
So hire me and I'll help you.

11:42.399 --> 11:45.534
Now why would I want
to do that?

11:45.602 --> 11:48.571
It's not a request.

11:48.639 --> 11:50.273
Looks like I don't exactly

11:50.340 --> 11:52.074
have a choice, now do I?

11:52.142 --> 11:54.777
Not if you want to find
out who killed your dad.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.168
Can I have your car keys?

12:03.236 --> 12:05.837
Thanks.
Get her out of here. Huh?

12:05.905 --> 12:07.806
You're not arresting me?

12:07.874 --> 12:09.141
Burns was taken moments
after you drove off, right?

12:09.208 --> 12:11.543
We haven't talked
about that yet.

12:11.611 --> 12:13.979
So put her in a cube with Torres.
We'll get fresh eyes on it.

12:14.047 --> 12:16.615
So where you going?
I'm gonna find Burns.

12:16.683 --> 12:18.183
You want to tell me
where that is?

12:18.251 --> 12:19.851
Sorry, mate.

12:19.919 --> 12:22.754
If they get a whiff of you,
they'll probably kill him.

12:26.559 --> 12:28.260
Hey, Cal.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.728
Did you break into my safe yet?

12:29.796 --> 12:31.330
It's quite a collection.

12:31.397 --> 12:33.932
I'm gonna need the blue file.

12:35.134 --> 12:36.902
Keep the copies.

12:36.970 --> 12:38.036
I'm on my way.

12:38.104 --> 12:40.105
Where are you going?

12:53.653 --> 12:56.121
Thanks a lot, I'll take it.

12:56.189 --> 12:57.789
I'm coming with you.

12:57.857 --> 13:01.326
Yeah. Apparently so.

13:04.364 --> 13:06.198
Get ready.

13:13.072 --> 13:15.507
Does your mom know
you're out joyriding?

13:18.044 --> 13:19.444
Get in.

13:27.453 --> 13:29.955
Hop out.

13:30.023 --> 13:32.090
Lose the hood.

13:41.067 --> 13:43.068
I told you to come alone.

13:43.136 --> 13:46.104
You hired
the Lightman group, right?

13:46.172 --> 13:49.141
She's part of it.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.909
Nice place you got here.

13:50.977 --> 13:53.345
You're little moon, ain't ya?

13:53.413 --> 13:56.014
Nice to meet you.

13:56.082 --> 13:57.983
Bloodied up.

13:59.585 --> 14:01.453
Now, you see,

14:01.521 --> 14:03.055
your torture victim,

14:03.122 --> 14:05.924
he's going to say anything
to make the pain go away.

14:05.992 --> 14:08.794
I mean, let's get your mate
up here on the hoist, you know.

14:08.861 --> 14:10.729
Let's get him talking about
shagging your mom, shall we?

14:10.797 --> 14:13.899
You said you'd help me find
out who killed my father.

14:13.966 --> 14:16.068
And if you don't...

14:16.135 --> 14:17.769
Ok.

14:17.837 --> 14:20.405
Well, I can't read him that.

14:20.473 --> 14:21.673
Show me what you do.

14:21.741 --> 14:23.809
Then she plays nurse.

14:25.244 --> 14:26.545
Ok.

14:26.612 --> 14:29.948
All right, um, a face,
it tells the truth.

14:30.016 --> 14:31.817
But you gotta look
for a base line.

14:31.884 --> 14:33.385
You know what I mean?

14:33.453 --> 14:36.621
All right, look at him.

14:36.689 --> 14:38.056
Where are you?

14:38.124 --> 14:40.792
I don't know where.

14:40.860 --> 14:42.227
No, I know you don't
know where you are.

14:42.295 --> 14:43.462
But make somewhere up.

14:43.529 --> 14:45.363
Make up a place.
Use your imagination.

14:45.431 --> 14:46.998
Look at me.

14:47.066 --> 14:49.034
I'm teaching a federal
agent how to lie.

14:49.102 --> 14:51.002
Who'd have thunk it?

14:52.371 --> 14:54.906
I'm waking at Gillian's.

14:54.974 --> 14:57.375
She's sleeping next to me.

14:57.443 --> 14:59.978
He's using encoded emotion.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.147
It's how most people lie.

15:02.215 --> 15:04.316
There's a wind chime
in her room.

15:04.383 --> 15:05.884
Oh, you see that?

15:05.952 --> 15:07.285
You see the lip?
That was disgust.

15:07.353 --> 15:09.121
At the wind chime?

15:09.188 --> 15:10.322
At you.

15:10.389 --> 15:12.290
Oh, yeah, well,
or your dad, you know.

15:12.358 --> 15:15.894
His father deserved my disgust.
He was a coke wholesaler.

15:18.264 --> 15:21.600
Anybody could have killed him.

15:21.667 --> 15:24.302
Well, that was a general truth.

15:24.370 --> 15:27.739
When he said "anybody,"
he was being deliberately vague.

15:27.807 --> 15:28.907
What are you doing, Cal?

15:28.975 --> 15:29.975
I'm doing my job.

15:30.042 --> 15:32.177
Who killed my father?

15:32.245 --> 15:34.479
Well, let her fix him up,
and we'll get to that, eh?

15:34.547 --> 15:38.016
Hey, hey, hey!

15:39.619 --> 15:41.786
Ahem.

15:41.854 --> 15:44.623
You're ashamed about
how your father died, right?

15:44.690 --> 15:46.892
He was found in a dumpster.
No.

15:46.959 --> 15:48.426
Well, he was... yeah, he was,
he was chucked out,

15:48.494 --> 15:49.895
like garbage...
stop!

15:49.962 --> 15:52.764
All right. Yeah. Yeah.

15:54.300 --> 15:59.504
Look, you're never going to restore
your father's honor like this.

15:59.572 --> 16:01.173
You want to talk about honor?

16:01.240 --> 16:03.275
You brought her here.

16:03.342 --> 16:04.509
A woman.

16:04.577 --> 16:06.044
Well, you didn't
hurt her, did you?

16:06.112 --> 16:07.546
I mean, if you were,

16:07.613 --> 16:09.681
you'd have taken her
when you took him.

16:09.749 --> 16:13.485
So you've earned my trust.

16:13.553 --> 16:16.188
Well, let me earn yours.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.890
All right?

16:23.963 --> 16:25.730
Ow!

16:25.798 --> 16:28.567
Ok, let him down.

16:36.842 --> 16:40.011
Ok.

16:41.214 --> 16:43.448
You ok?

16:57.001 --> 16:59.255
He's young and experienced.

16:59.828 --> 17:01.528
He's trying
to fill his father's shoes.

17:01.648 --> 17:03.008
Which makes him more dangerous.

17:03.076 --> 17:04.108
Yeah.

17:04.176 --> 17:05.611
What are they doing now?

17:05.679 --> 17:06.779
They're arguing,

17:06.847 --> 17:08.481
about whether
to kill us or not.

17:09.382 --> 17:10.915
What's the plan?

17:10.983 --> 17:13.352
Only stressed.

17:13.420 --> 17:15.119
Little moon:
What is he doing?

17:15.188 --> 17:18.089
You notice anything interesting

17:18.157 --> 17:19.625
about little moon over there?

17:19.693 --> 17:21.794
Respect, honor,

17:21.862 --> 17:23.729
defense of his mom's privates.

17:23.797 --> 17:26.699
He's a principled sociopath.

17:26.766 --> 17:28.267
Maybe.
He's ok with danger

17:28.335 --> 17:30.102
as long as it sticks
to a set of rules.

17:30.170 --> 17:31.537
You think we can use that?

17:31.605 --> 17:33.539
Get inside his head.

17:33.607 --> 17:35.541
Shake it like a snow globe.

17:35.609 --> 17:37.610
You're going to play them
against one another.

17:39.279 --> 17:41.146
Pat attention, Burnsy.

17:41.214 --> 17:43.048
We're going to do a little
song and dance act.

17:44.484 --> 17:47.553
Get up. Up!

17:49.389 --> 17:50.789
Move!

17:50.857 --> 17:53.526
Move.

17:53.593 --> 17:56.395
So where do you think
they may have taken Burns?

17:57.964 --> 17:59.932
Little moon's trying to follow
his father's footsteps.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.434
I'd say a drop spot.

18:02.502 --> 18:03.702
Drop spot?

18:03.770 --> 18:05.638
Yeah, it's a place where
dealers go to move product.

18:05.705 --> 18:06.906
It usually has a view.

18:06.973 --> 18:08.941
So their rivals can't rob them.

18:09.009 --> 18:10.809
Big moon had
a few that he used.

18:10.877 --> 18:12.478
So you think he may
have taken them there?

18:12.546 --> 18:14.747
He learned from the best.

18:15.849 --> 18:18.651
Why are you so angry
in this picture?

18:18.718 --> 18:21.320
I have already told you
everything that I know.

18:21.388 --> 18:23.322
You're averting your gaze,
you can't even look at it.

18:23.390 --> 18:25.524
Burns wouldn't leave town because
he was dating your boss.

18:25.592 --> 18:27.960
What's her name again?
Maybe you were jealous

18:28.028 --> 18:29.228
and wanted to hurt him.

18:29.296 --> 18:31.397
That's the kind of thinking
that's going to get Burns

18:31.464 --> 18:33.566
and your bosses
killed by teenagers.

18:34.401 --> 18:35.701
See, that's the thing.

18:35.769 --> 18:37.503
You're not upset by that.

18:37.571 --> 18:39.572
You're full of guilt.

18:40.640 --> 18:41.674
Cal: Look me in the eye

18:41.741 --> 18:45.311
and tell me you didn't
kill this man's father.

18:46.913 --> 18:49.582
No, me.

18:49.649 --> 18:50.950
In the eye.

18:51.017 --> 18:52.217
Not here, all right?

18:52.285 --> 18:55.321
I didn't kill anyone.

18:57.357 --> 19:00.559
All right, I write everything
down for shoplifting.

19:06.833 --> 19:08.534
Why the fear?

19:09.369 --> 19:11.170
You did it.

19:11.237 --> 19:13.339
You killed him.

19:16.476 --> 19:18.243
No.

19:18.311 --> 19:21.480
You're talking out of your ass.

19:22.449 --> 19:24.183
I'm not seeing
what you're seeing.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.485
What's your game?

19:26.553 --> 19:29.021
You jealous?

19:29.089 --> 19:30.990
Now that's a deflection,
that is.

19:31.057 --> 19:32.625
Deflection?
Yeah.

19:32.692 --> 19:35.361
You can't stand me
being around Gillian.

19:35.428 --> 19:37.730
Look, mate,
this is not about her!

19:37.797 --> 19:40.899
Your feelings for her are the
only reason that you're here.

19:40.967 --> 19:42.134
You want the truth?

19:42.202 --> 19:44.403
Be honest.

19:45.505 --> 19:46.705
You killed him, right?

19:46.773 --> 19:48.307
You're going to get him killed!

19:48.375 --> 19:51.143
Admit it. You want her.

19:52.078 --> 19:54.246
Yes, I do.

19:55.682 --> 19:58.851
In the worst possible way.

20:00.086 --> 20:02.121
All right?

20:02.188 --> 20:04.957
Now it's your turn.

20:05.025 --> 20:07.893
I've had to pretend
to be a scumbag

20:07.961 --> 20:09.728
my entire career.

20:09.796 --> 20:13.232
I've done a lot of things
that I'm not proud of.

20:13.299 --> 20:16.068
Murder's not one of them.

20:16.136 --> 20:18.904
Wrong answer.

20:19.639 --> 20:22.141
He's not picking up.

20:22.208 --> 20:23.575
We were supposed to have lunch.

20:23.643 --> 20:25.044
Well, the office is closed.

20:25.111 --> 20:26.412
They went to a talk.

20:26.479 --> 20:28.380
I'm not 10.

20:28.448 --> 20:30.115
And I know when
I'm being lied to.

20:30.183 --> 20:32.818
I'll just wait in his office.

20:32.886 --> 20:34.720
She didn't mean it,
she's just worried.

20:34.788 --> 20:37.990
Yeah, well,
she's not the only one.

20:39.359 --> 20:40.592
Yeah, do it!

20:40.660 --> 20:42.795
Throw him over!

20:42.862 --> 20:45.297
What makes you think
he killed your dad, eh?

20:45.365 --> 20:46.498
You just said he did!

20:46.566 --> 20:49.101
And he disappeared once
my pops wound up dead.

20:49.169 --> 20:50.569
So, what, you're a
detective now, are you?

20:50.637 --> 20:53.238
If he didn't do it, he's got
nothing to be scared of, right?

20:53.306 --> 20:55.641
Well, apart from the obvious.

20:55.709 --> 20:56.875
Throw him over!

20:56.943 --> 20:58.877
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait!

20:58.945 --> 21:00.112
Bring him back.

21:00.680 --> 21:03.114
He's not hiding his own guilt.

21:03.182 --> 21:04.816
He's protecting someone.

21:04.884 --> 21:06.251
Who?
I don't know.

21:06.319 --> 21:08.453
Another undercover cop, maybe.

21:11.023 --> 21:12.390
You saw that, right?

21:12.458 --> 21:14.125
What?

21:14.193 --> 21:15.427
Of course not.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.429
That's why you need me.

21:23.436 --> 21:25.604
Unless I'm under arrest,

21:25.671 --> 21:27.639
I would like to leave.

21:31.043 --> 21:33.945
Ahh.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.249
You know, I became an addict

21:37.316 --> 21:40.318
working undercover on the job.

21:40.386 --> 21:42.053
This isn't about drugs.

21:42.121 --> 21:44.356
No. The point is,

21:44.423 --> 21:47.225
when you're real good
at the job, you know,

21:47.293 --> 21:49.361
real dedicated...

21:49.428 --> 21:52.597
You start to disappear.

21:52.665 --> 21:54.899
Your values, your judgment,

21:54.967 --> 21:57.435
your character goes
right out the window.

21:57.503 --> 21:58.603
And before you know it,

21:58.671 --> 22:01.072
you've lost everything.

22:01.140 --> 22:03.742
And everyone.

22:03.809 --> 22:07.012
But there is one person
you haven't lost.

22:07.079 --> 22:09.547
Until now.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.451
He's talking about Burns.

22:17.023 --> 22:20.792
Being a woman

22:20.860 --> 22:23.695
in that world...

22:23.763 --> 22:25.730
Phew.

22:25.798 --> 22:28.099
Things work a certain way.

22:28.167 --> 22:31.469
You don't have the power;

22:31.537 --> 22:34.773
the brute force.

22:34.840 --> 22:38.610
You don't come at
things straight on.

22:38.678 --> 22:40.345
You seduce.

22:40.413 --> 22:41.980
When it works.

22:42.048 --> 22:44.749
And when it doesn't work...

22:44.817 --> 22:47.485
It's the other way around.

22:48.888 --> 22:51.956
So you and Burns were involved.

22:52.024 --> 22:53.692
No.

22:53.759 --> 22:57.128
Not Burns.

22:59.799 --> 23:03.134
Me and the dead man.

23:09.608 --> 23:12.143
Little moon:
I want the name.

23:13.913 --> 23:15.213
Did you hear him?

23:15.281 --> 23:17.615
Yeah, he wants names.

23:17.683 --> 23:19.050
Names?

23:19.118 --> 23:20.785
There's more than
one killer then, eh?

23:20.853 --> 23:22.787
Does it matter at this point?

23:22.855 --> 23:24.589
Well, it matters to them, yeah.

23:24.657 --> 23:26.891
You know what happens
if I give them names?

23:26.959 --> 23:28.760
He kills them
and their families.

23:28.828 --> 23:30.595
You don't trade their lives
for the life of one man,

23:30.663 --> 23:33.198
not even if that man's you.

23:33.265 --> 23:35.066
Bloody hell! You really are

23:35.134 --> 23:37.035
Captain America, aren't you?

23:38.270 --> 23:39.437
He knows, you know.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.705
Who are they?

23:40.773 --> 23:42.540
I don't know.

23:42.608 --> 23:43.942
DEA?

23:44.009 --> 23:47.145
How many?

23:47.213 --> 23:50.482
One? Two?

23:52.418 --> 23:54.319
All right, two it is.

23:54.387 --> 23:56.121
Why would DEA kill my dad?

23:56.188 --> 23:58.156
That's a good question.

23:58.224 --> 24:00.725
His father expanded too fast.

24:00.793 --> 24:03.795
We couldn't reposition
our guys.

24:03.863 --> 24:06.831
Your dad was killing off
the competition, right?

24:06.899 --> 24:09.067
He was so good at his job,

24:09.135 --> 24:11.569
right, that they were
scared of him.

24:11.637 --> 24:13.705
Who did the hit?

24:13.773 --> 24:15.673
He just told you...
2 DEA agents.

24:15.741 --> 24:17.342
Names!
Why is that so important to you?

24:17.410 --> 24:20.278
I need to know
if they came to his wake.

24:20.346 --> 24:22.914
I need to know if they shook
my grandmother's hand,

24:22.982 --> 24:26.251
stood in the mud
when the coffin went down.

24:26.318 --> 24:28.119
Russo.

24:28.187 --> 24:30.422
That was her cover name.

24:30.489 --> 24:31.923
Leave her out of it.

24:31.991 --> 24:34.125
Oh, I struck
a raw nee there, did I?

24:34.193 --> 24:35.894
She couldn't pull the trigger.

24:35.961 --> 24:37.996
Oh, do me a favor.

24:38.063 --> 24:39.531
I mean, I was with her
a couple of hours ago, right,

24:39.598 --> 24:42.700
and she almost
blew a man's head off

24:42.768 --> 24:45.036
over an 8-ball. I mean,
what's the difference between

24:45.104 --> 24:47.038
gas and big moon?

24:47.106 --> 24:48.740
Ask her.
Well, I would,

24:48.808 --> 24:51.209
right? But she's not here,
so I'm asking you.

24:51.277 --> 24:53.578
Eh?

24:53.646 --> 24:56.948
Did she get too close to you?

24:58.317 --> 25:01.386
Why couldn't she
pull the trigger?

25:02.655 --> 25:05.356
She's pregnant.

25:05.424 --> 25:08.092
Your point being?

25:12.398 --> 25:14.032
Oh.

25:14.099 --> 25:17.001
Your dad knocked her up.

25:17.069 --> 25:18.770
As charming as that is.

25:23.675 --> 25:26.343
That's not true!

25:26.411 --> 25:28.245
Stop it!

25:30.282 --> 25:32.216
Stop it! Stop it!

25:32.284 --> 25:35.019
Stop it!

25:41.559 --> 25:43.360
So you had an affair while you
were undercover, big deal.

25:43.428 --> 25:45.863
It wasn't just an affair.

25:45.930 --> 25:49.667
It jammed me up; Prevented
me from doing my job.

25:49.734 --> 25:51.702
All right, so this guy moon,
he had a lot of game.

25:51.770 --> 25:52.936
Charisma.

25:53.004 --> 25:54.838
Fast talker.

25:54.906 --> 25:57.041
Higher ups could see he was
going to ruin the sting,

25:57.108 --> 25:59.476
so they ordered me
to either flip him

25:59.544 --> 26:02.613
or kill him.

26:02.681 --> 26:05.316
I was the only one who
could get that close.

26:05.383 --> 26:07.518
I couldn't bring
myself to do it.

26:07.585 --> 26:11.455
So since you couldn't do it, Burns
stepped in, he did it for you.

26:12.991 --> 26:16.927
After moon was whacked,
Burns was forced to vanish.

26:16.995 --> 26:18.529
Heard little moon was looking,

26:18.596 --> 26:20.764
but I never thought
he'd find him.

26:20.832 --> 26:22.299
He did.

26:22.367 --> 26:24.168
And now you gotta help us
find them.

26:24.235 --> 26:26.537
I told you about
all the drop spots.

26:26.604 --> 26:28.172
No. I've been talking
to my FBI contacts.

26:28.239 --> 26:29.306
Dead end.

26:29.374 --> 26:30.541
You gotta come clean.

26:30.608 --> 26:32.042
I'm done.

26:32.110 --> 26:33.243
Listen, you're close
with the guy, right?

26:33.311 --> 26:34.778
You spent enough time
with him to get involved,

26:34.846 --> 26:36.280
and you knew
how he did business.

26:36.348 --> 26:37.281
You must have
spent time with his son.

26:37.349 --> 26:39.350
I didn't!
I didn't even...

26:41.252 --> 26:43.020
What?

26:44.356 --> 26:47.524
The only time I spent with
him was during a beating.

26:47.592 --> 26:49.993
Little moon was
making his first deal.

26:50.061 --> 26:53.464
A bunch of us hooded up and went to
the spot where it was happening.

26:53.531 --> 26:55.566
To beat the kid down?
Big moon wanted his son

26:55.633 --> 26:57.968
to learn how easy it is
to get your stash stolen.

26:58.036 --> 27:01.004
The kind of spot someone might use
to teach someone else a lesson.

27:01.072 --> 27:03.507
Yeah.

27:07.312 --> 27:10.347
We need to get him
to a hospital.

27:12.517 --> 27:15.185
Did you hear me?!

27:16.221 --> 27:18.522
Oy, moon?

27:19.491 --> 27:20.924
She's talking to you.

27:20.992 --> 27:22.092
You broke his ribs
when you kicked him.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.595
He's having a tension
pneunothorax.

27:24.662 --> 27:25.596
What the hell does that mean?

27:25.663 --> 27:28.198
It means he can't talk.

27:30.702 --> 27:32.336
He's faking it.

27:32.404 --> 27:35.205
No, this is not
something that you can fake!

27:35.273 --> 27:37.875
One side of his chest
is rising and falling!

27:37.942 --> 27:40.611
You a doctor. Fix it.

27:40.678 --> 27:42.679
I'm not that kind of doctor.

27:42.747 --> 27:43.814
Then he dies.

27:43.882 --> 27:44.782
If he dies,

27:44.849 --> 27:46.049
then you'll never find out

27:46.117 --> 27:47.918
what happened to your father.

27:51.956 --> 27:54.291
Hey.

27:54.359 --> 27:56.293
You got a little trouble
staying awake, son?

27:56.361 --> 27:57.761
No, man.

27:57.829 --> 27:59.963
Can I have a word with you?

28:00.031 --> 28:02.166
In private.

28:08.173 --> 28:10.307
So you are being
lied to, right?

28:10.375 --> 28:11.408
You don't think I know that?

28:11.476 --> 28:13.243
No, no, I'm not just
talking about her.

28:13.311 --> 28:15.245
I'm talking about, you know...

28:15.313 --> 28:17.114
Who's your mate on the right?

28:18.650 --> 28:20.050
Harris.
Yeah, him.

28:20.118 --> 28:21.151
What you mean?

28:21.219 --> 28:22.352
You see when he yawns,

28:22.420 --> 28:23.720
it's like a nervous yawn.

28:23.788 --> 28:25.722
It means he's hiding something.

28:25.790 --> 28:28.792
What?
I don't know.

28:30.462 --> 28:33.297
I've known Harris
since we was young,

28:33.364 --> 28:35.566
so back to your lady friend.

28:35.633 --> 28:36.700
Well, she knows

28:36.768 --> 28:38.335
that he knows the name
of the killer.

28:38.403 --> 28:41.705
Right? But if he can't
speak, then...

28:41.773 --> 28:44.408
Then he can't give me
the answer.

28:44.476 --> 28:47.010
Trust no bitch.

28:47.078 --> 28:48.712
Yeah. Yeah.

28:48.780 --> 28:50.013
Why you helping?

28:50.081 --> 28:51.582
'Cause I fancy her.

28:51.649 --> 28:53.750
Look, have your friend there

28:53.818 --> 28:55.419
drop her back at the car.

28:55.487 --> 28:56.787
I'll find out
who killed your dad.

28:56.855 --> 28:59.523
Then you can do with
Burns whatever you want.

28:59.591 --> 29:00.858
All right?

29:00.925 --> 29:02.292
All right.

29:02.360 --> 29:04.561
You'll make your dad proud.

29:04.629 --> 29:06.597
All right.

29:06.664 --> 29:08.265
Now watch this.

29:13.972 --> 29:16.006
Pack your bags.

29:16.074 --> 29:17.975
What? What? No, hey!

29:18.042 --> 29:20.177
We'll have a little man
to man, me and you.

29:20.245 --> 29:21.578
You still got
all those bullocks,

29:21.646 --> 29:23.447
so you can't talk,
right? Right?

29:23.515 --> 29:25.682
I need a knife.
Give me a knife.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.417
Gillian:
Cal, Cal! No, Cal!

29:27.485 --> 29:28.852
I'm going to need something
like a hollow ball.

29:28.920 --> 29:30.454
Like a pipe.

29:30.522 --> 29:31.822
Yeah, a pipe, you know.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.958
Give me that straw,
that'll do it.

29:39.931 --> 29:42.900
You're going to love this.

29:44.702 --> 29:46.570
Hey, dad.

29:46.638 --> 29:48.272
We were supposed to have lunch.

29:48.339 --> 29:50.707
Just call me back, please.

30:27.478 --> 30:30.347
It's funny how you're
creeping on the cop's girl.

30:30.415 --> 30:33.684
Doctors be getting
a lot more women than cops,

30:33.751 --> 30:36.486
even getting lady doctors.

30:36.554 --> 30:38.589
What kind of car you drive?

30:38.656 --> 30:39.723
Prius.

30:40.959 --> 30:44.127
It's deceptively fast.

30:45.196 --> 30:47.097
What you gonna do with that?

30:47.165 --> 30:50.434
Well, if what she says is true,

30:50.501 --> 30:53.003
he's got air trapped
in his chest,

30:53.071 --> 30:55.238
we gotta get it out
or he's gonna die.

30:55.306 --> 30:58.575
Ok, so, now open his shirt.

30:58.643 --> 31:01.211
Come on, open his shirt.

31:04.115 --> 31:06.650
All right, pull.

31:06.718 --> 31:09.286
Ok, you got
a little bit of space

31:09.354 --> 31:10.988
between the second
and the third rib.

31:11.055 --> 31:13.523
You should start down at the bottom here.
That's it.

31:13.591 --> 31:14.791
And you work your way up.
Right in there.

31:14.859 --> 31:16.927
Keep your finger there.
Now what?

31:16.995 --> 31:18.629
Now what you're going to
do is take the knife,

31:18.696 --> 31:21.031
like that, and you're going to

31:21.099 --> 31:22.833
pop the knife in.

31:22.900 --> 31:25.435
You pop it right in,

31:25.503 --> 31:26.637
right where your fingers are.

31:26.704 --> 31:28.171
Just there, all right?

31:28.239 --> 31:29.806
Ok?

31:29.874 --> 31:32.476
There you go, son.

31:32.543 --> 31:33.810
Go on.

31:34.646 --> 31:36.313
Do it, h.

31:36.381 --> 31:38.548
You the doctor now.

31:39.984 --> 31:41.785
Pop it in.
That's it.

31:41.853 --> 31:43.487
Do it.

31:43.554 --> 31:45.489
All right, ready?
All right, one.

31:45.556 --> 31:48.125
Go on.

31:49.293 --> 31:51.194
Do it!

31:51.262 --> 31:53.664
That's it,
pop it in. Go on.

31:54.966 --> 31:57.300
You can't do it, can you?

31:57.368 --> 31:59.336
Give me that, give me that.

31:59.404 --> 32:00.337
Give me that.

32:00.405 --> 32:02.906
Let's see.

32:02.974 --> 32:05.509
Yeah, I thought as much.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.714
Right there.

32:13.818 --> 32:16.019
All right, all right!

32:17.922 --> 32:20.624
I'll talk.

32:51.913 --> 32:54.247
You a pretty lady.

33:07.196 --> 33:09.030
Get out.

33:27.982 --> 33:29.583
Get out of the car!

33:29.651 --> 33:32.019
Open the door, move it!

33:32.087 --> 33:35.055
Down on the ground!

33:47.001 --> 33:48.935
Hey, Em.

33:49.003 --> 33:50.437
You ok?

33:50.504 --> 33:53.540
Yeah. Everything's
totally normal.

33:53.608 --> 33:55.175
I'm just reading
my grandmother's diary

33:55.243 --> 33:58.545
that I found in
my missing father's safe.

33:58.613 --> 34:01.348
Oh.

34:01.415 --> 34:04.451
"Declaration
of tax amnesty."

34:04.518 --> 34:06.553
What's that about?

34:07.588 --> 34:09.589
You know, I don't know.

34:09.657 --> 34:12.993
And then there's this.

34:14.027 --> 34:16.730
"In conclusion,
we find that based on

34:16.797 --> 34:19.099
"the genetic testing results...

34:19.166 --> 34:22.601
"The probability of paternity

34:22.670 --> 34:25.405
is 99.99%."

34:25.473 --> 34:28.608
It says that your dad's
your dad, Em.

34:28.676 --> 34:31.578
I mean, the test shows
that conclusively.

34:31.646 --> 34:36.917
Yeah, but why would he have
checked in the first place?

34:43.525 --> 34:44.690
All right, so I understand

34:44.759 --> 34:45.826
why you want
to protect Russo, right,

34:45.893 --> 34:47.594
'cause she was your partner.

34:47.661 --> 34:50.130
But for the life of me,
I couldn't figure out

34:50.197 --> 34:52.299
why you wouldn't
give up your name.

34:52.367 --> 34:54.668
Till a few minutes ago.

34:57.238 --> 34:59.473
One of the people

34:59.541 --> 35:02.676
that killed your father
is in this room.

35:02.744 --> 35:04.845
Him.
No, not him.

35:04.913 --> 35:08.348
I wish it was him, you know how I
feel about this man, all right.

35:08.416 --> 35:11.285
He is all about rules.

35:11.352 --> 35:12.486
And he's a federal agent.

35:12.554 --> 35:14.888
As a federal agent, he is sworn

35:14.956 --> 35:18.292
to protect the identity of
a confidential informant.

35:18.359 --> 35:20.928
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:20.995 --> 35:22.329
Oh, really?

35:22.397 --> 35:24.031
You want to torture me again?

35:24.098 --> 35:25.833
Yeah, yeah, I do.

35:25.900 --> 35:28.669
I'd love to, but I'll take a
rain check on that, all right?

35:28.736 --> 35:31.038
I mean, you can't give it up.

35:31.105 --> 35:36.009
But then I caught
the look between these two.

35:43.084 --> 35:44.384
Why are you looking at me?

35:44.452 --> 35:46.353
Well, I know I'm not
a c.I., right,

35:46.421 --> 35:48.088
and I'm damn sure he's not.

35:48.156 --> 35:49.857
So...

35:49.924 --> 35:52.960
Who's that leave, eh?

36:06.808 --> 36:08.375
You're a c.I.?!

36:08.409 --> 36:10.344
No!

36:10.411 --> 36:12.546
Sorry, h.

36:16.618 --> 36:18.519
What's wrong with you, money?

36:18.586 --> 36:20.521
He lyin'.

36:20.588 --> 36:22.155
You yawned.

36:22.223 --> 36:24.024
It's this thing you do.

36:24.092 --> 36:26.660
It means you're lying!

36:26.728 --> 36:28.462
You did hear him, right?

36:28.530 --> 36:29.796
You heard him say
"I killed a man."

36:29.864 --> 36:33.100
Well, he's talking
about your father.

36:33.167 --> 36:35.135
No!

36:35.203 --> 36:37.304
I never killed no man!

36:37.372 --> 36:39.306
You kill my father?

36:39.374 --> 36:40.407
No!

36:40.475 --> 36:43.143
He see your temper
and he playing you!

36:43.211 --> 36:45.612
Then put your gun down.

36:45.680 --> 36:46.647
No.

36:46.714 --> 36:48.115
You'll shoot me!

36:48.182 --> 36:50.317
Put it down!

36:50.385 --> 36:52.052
I loved your father.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.187
Loved him.

36:55.156 --> 36:56.990
Look at me, fool!

36:57.058 --> 36:59.893
Look!

37:04.532 --> 37:07.200
I believe you.

37:18.446 --> 37:22.316
You should have never
pointed your gun at me.

37:22.383 --> 37:24.952
FBI!

37:25.019 --> 37:26.853
Get down!

37:26.921 --> 37:30.223
Drop the weapon!
Drop it!

37:41.039 --> 37:42.173
He made it, eh?

37:42.241 --> 37:43.407
You know him?

37:43.475 --> 37:46.778
I'm the reason he got shot.
Well, he's lucky.

37:46.845 --> 37:48.913
Bullet missed his artery.
Kid could have died.

37:48.981 --> 37:50.581
He's an adult, though.

37:50.649 --> 37:53.251
I mean, in the eyes
of the court.

37:53.318 --> 37:55.520
I'm right, right?

38:00.626 --> 38:02.193
How you doing?
You all right?

38:02.261 --> 38:05.530
Can I have a minute, love?

38:09.501 --> 38:11.502
So...

38:11.570 --> 38:13.805
You killed a man, right?

38:13.872 --> 38:16.641
Moon's father.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.042
'Cause your partner couldn't.

38:18.110 --> 38:19.744
That's it, right?

38:21.413 --> 38:23.815
I did what I had to do

38:23.882 --> 38:26.250
to protect the agents
that work for me.

38:26.318 --> 38:28.719
You get that, right?

38:31.924 --> 38:33.858
Nice work in there, by the way.

38:33.926 --> 38:36.594
You're one of the best liars
that I've seen in a long time.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.763
Back at ya.

38:40.132 --> 38:42.066
So you're not just
in Gillian's life

38:42.134 --> 38:43.935
for a bit of the old, you know.

38:44.002 --> 38:46.404
Sex?

38:47.840 --> 38:50.474
You can't say
the other word, can you?

38:52.144 --> 38:54.378
Love.

38:57.916 --> 39:00.952
Dave. You've got
one minute.

39:05.357 --> 39:06.824
They're not going to give
me my old life back.

39:06.892 --> 39:09.427
My cover's been blown.

39:09.494 --> 39:11.729
All right.

39:13.098 --> 39:15.199
You're walking?
Are you crazy?

39:15.267 --> 39:16.934
Hey.

39:17.002 --> 39:19.270
Up and walking... oh, oh,
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

39:19.338 --> 39:21.672
I checked myself out.

39:21.740 --> 39:23.541
I can't blame you, really.

39:23.609 --> 39:25.776
These places will kill you.

39:25.844 --> 39:27.445
Dave.

39:29.147 --> 39:31.816
I'll meet you back
at your apartment. Ok?

39:36.321 --> 39:38.956
I'll see you there.

39:54.172 --> 39:57.642
He doesn't want me
to follow him.

39:57.709 --> 39:59.510
No.

39:59.578 --> 40:01.479
They're going to move him.

40:01.546 --> 40:04.415
Change his name.

40:11.089 --> 40:13.958
I liked the one he had.

40:19.898 --> 40:22.867
All right, now this is just
getting ridiculous, Danielle.

40:22.935 --> 40:27.071
Come on, it's like art
for your stomach.

40:27.139 --> 40:29.640
It's like hotel art.
You leave the tip.

40:29.708 --> 40:32.743
You know, you could have
died yesterday.

40:33.712 --> 40:35.313
Possibly.

40:35.380 --> 40:37.815
So you admit you're an idiot.

40:37.883 --> 40:40.551
No, because...

40:40.619 --> 40:42.520
If I was an idiot,

40:42.587 --> 40:47.291
right, I would get into
far more mundane

40:47.359 --> 40:49.160
trouble, or, you know,

40:49.227 --> 40:51.696
forgetting a lunch date
with your daughter.

40:51.763 --> 40:53.431
It's a good thing
you never do that.

40:53.498 --> 40:55.933
Absolutely, I've grown up.

41:00.973 --> 41:03.140
Don't tell me you read
your granny's diary.

41:04.309 --> 41:06.243
You read your granny's diary.

41:06.311 --> 41:07.812
And, oh, look at this.

41:07.879 --> 41:11.716
I am 99.99% yours.

41:11.783 --> 41:13.884
You know, you might want
to take this test again.

41:13.952 --> 41:16.887
There's still a .01% chance

41:16.955 --> 41:18.489
that people in the lab
were lying.

41:18.557 --> 41:20.491
What, so I might
get lucky, you mean?

41:20.559 --> 41:22.994
Yeah.

41:23.061 --> 41:25.396
Right.

41:25.464 --> 41:27.298
Me and your mom, all right,

41:27.366 --> 41:31.335
we gate crashed this awful...

41:31.403 --> 41:33.070
Party at Harvard.

41:33.138 --> 41:35.072
I look across the room,
and there's your mom.

41:35.140 --> 41:37.441
She's being chatted up
by some astronomer.

41:37.509 --> 41:40.611
She's laughing her ass off.

41:40.679 --> 41:42.980
All these jokes, and stuff.

41:43.048 --> 41:46.617
And she's flirting with him,
you know, as she does.

41:46.685 --> 41:50.321
And I caught just the
tiniest flash of something.

41:50.389 --> 41:51.355
Something?

41:51.423 --> 41:53.224
Yeah, something.

41:53.291 --> 41:54.792
It was probably just
the earliest bits of you

41:54.860 --> 41:56.193
just floating around in
there somewhere, you know,

41:56.261 --> 41:58.062
'cause it was around that time.

41:58.130 --> 42:00.564
But I don't know
what it was. But...

42:01.900 --> 42:04.769
A scientist's job

42:04.836 --> 42:09.240
is to verify, right?

42:10.208 --> 42:13.411
You never trust anyone, do you?

42:15.247 --> 42:18.215
You know, that's why
you'll always be alone.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.367
I'm not alone.
