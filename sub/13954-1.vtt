02:18.004 --> 02:22.941
Taken...

03:30.643 --> 03:35.580
Do I?

03:37.817 --> 03:42.049
To us.

03:42.121 --> 03:47.058
Us.

03:48.294 --> 03:52.628
Do you know what
you're gonna name her?

03:52.699 --> 03:56.465
Allie.

03:56.536 --> 04:01.064
Her name is Allie.

04:01.140 --> 04:06.077
ERIC: I want you to join me
in the program, Mary.

04:06.579 --> 04:09.980
You're grandfather found this
in Pine Lodge, New Mexico.

04:10.049 --> 04:14.986
Found it at a crash site.

04:15.455 --> 04:18.015
So it's all true.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.788
This is something that shouldn't
go outside the family.

04:21.861 --> 04:24.853
What's this, Allie?

04:24.931 --> 04:27.991
That's my journal.

04:28.067 --> 04:29.830
I write down things I think of and stuff.

04:29.902 --> 04:31.164
We need your help, gentlemen.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.364
You'll stop playing games
and tell us everything you know

04:33.439 --> 04:34.872
about whoever it is who's out there
and what the hell they want.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.670
Mr. Miller has an implant.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.041
We're monitoring it.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.739
The implants broadcast
on a spread spectrum.

04:40.813 --> 04:42.405
We block those frequencies,
the implant doesn't register.

04:42.482 --> 04:44.245
ERIC: Will this work on Allie?

04:44.317 --> 04:46.217
We can block her frequency, too.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.548
And they can't find her.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.178
ERIC: Let's pick her up.

04:49.255 --> 04:51.450
She can manipulate time.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.321
That therapy group her mother's in?
We have someone in that group.

04:53.393 --> 04:55.725
Put your gun away, Ray!

04:55.795 --> 04:57.763
You don't want to do this.
Put the gun away!

04:57.830 --> 04:59.798
You know who's in there, right,
besides the little girl?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.493
Her mother and her father... Charlie.

05:01.567 --> 05:03.501
That means he knows, and that's
two people with a lot of information

05:03.569 --> 05:06.231
that have had some pretty bad
experiences with us over the years.

05:06.306 --> 05:10.208
They have to go.

05:10.276 --> 05:15.213
Dr. Penzler, too.

05:16.449 --> 05:19.543
What are you doing, Allie?

05:19.619 --> 05:21.052
Look at me, Dad.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.453
(gasps)

05:24.524 --> 05:29.461
Get away!

05:31.531 --> 05:36.468
Take the little girl and... it's a trick!

05:36.903 --> 05:41.636
Run!

05:41.708 --> 05:42.970
Come on!

05:43.042 --> 05:47.979
I'll take care of you. Come on.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.761
CHET: Where did they go?

06:05.832 --> 06:10.769
ALLIE: Miss Crawford...

06:10.937 --> 06:15.874
I'm ready to go with you now.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.209
ALLIE: <i>I guess I always knew</i>

06:19.278 --> 06:22.975
<i>that there was</i>
<i>something different about me.</i>

06:23.049 --> 06:27.986
<i>But when all of this</i>
<i>began to happen,</i>

06:29.956 --> 06:34.893
<i>when I started</i>
<i>to be able to do things,</i>

06:37.563 --> 06:40.191
<i>it was kind of scary</i>...

06:40.266 --> 06:43.758
<i>like in a dream</i>
<i>where you start falling</i>

06:43.836 --> 06:48.773
<i>and it feels kind of good,</i>

06:49.008 --> 06:53.945
<i>until you begin to wonder</i>
<i>if you'll ever be able to stop.</i>

06:54.914 --> 06:58.782
That was a good trick.

06:58.851 --> 07:00.478
You're a very complicated little girl.

07:00.553 --> 07:02.578
What do you mean?

07:02.655 --> 07:07.592
I mean, with what you can do,

07:09.228 --> 07:14.165
you could have walked out
of that building.

07:16.969 --> 07:21.599
Why did you let us take you?

07:21.674 --> 07:26.611
I wanted you to leave my mom
and all the other people alone.

07:29.882 --> 07:31.144
I was afraid you might hurt someone.

07:31.217 --> 07:35.517
I thought if I went with you,
they'd be all right.

07:35.588 --> 07:40.525
Allie?

07:40.660 --> 07:42.628
It's 12:17. We've lost two hours.

07:42.695 --> 07:44.822
What?

07:44.897 --> 07:47.866
We've lost two hours.

07:47.934 --> 07:50.425
Are you all right?

07:50.503 --> 07:54.997
Look, what I did... I'm sorry.

07:55.074 --> 07:59.067
It's okay. I'm alive. We're all alive.

07:59.145 --> 08:04.082
Everyone get out of here.
Don't go home.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.217
Find places where
you're gonna be safe.

08:11.290 --> 08:16.227
- Allie?
- Just get out of here! Go!

08:19.499 --> 08:24.436
LISA: Allie!

08:25.338 --> 08:26.566
CHARLIE: Go!

08:26.639 --> 08:29.403
LISA: Allie?

08:29.475 --> 08:33.844
Allie!

08:33.913 --> 08:37.974
Allie!

08:38.049 --> 08:40.075
Lisa, she's gone. She's not here.

08:40.152 --> 08:43.815
Where did she go?
Where did they take her?

08:43.890 --> 08:45.653
Allie!

08:45.725 --> 08:47.886
Allie!

08:47.960 --> 08:50.155
I've got to find my daughter, please!

08:50.229 --> 08:54.359
I know.

08:54.433 --> 08:55.058
Allie did this...

08:55.134 --> 08:56.362
the time... all of it.

08:56.435 --> 08:59.029
Allie gave us missing time?

08:59.105 --> 09:02.074
Y-Y-Yes.

09:02.141 --> 09:03.540
She... she stopped time.

09:03.609 --> 09:04.667
She stopped us,

09:04.744 --> 09:06.075
she stopped us
and let time keep moving.

09:06.145 --> 09:07.942
She wanted to keep us safe,
and she did that.

09:08.014 --> 09:09.845
She needed the missing time

09:09.916 --> 09:13.613
so that she could go with them
without us trying to stop her.

09:13.686 --> 09:17.247
She was trying to keep us safe.

09:17.323 --> 09:20.121
(radio plays)

09:20.192 --> 09:22.558
(knock on door)

09:22.628 --> 09:23.652
I'm coming!

09:23.729 --> 09:25.026
Oh, thank God.
I've been worried sick!

09:25.097 --> 09:26.257
I went by your apartment
four times.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.027
I kept calling. What happened?
Are you all right?

09:28.100 --> 09:29.897
(voice breaking) Allie's gone.

09:29.969 --> 09:33.496
Do you know who I am?

09:33.573 --> 09:37.475
Not exactly.

09:37.543 --> 09:42.480
Well... um...

09:44.550 --> 09:47.178
our families go way back...

09:47.253 --> 09:52.190
mine and your mom's
and your dad's.

10:04.503 --> 10:09.440
I kind of think that you and I
might be the end of all this.

10:19.085 --> 10:24.022
We might just be
the beginning.

10:24.156 --> 10:27.819
Your grandfather wasn't
a very happy man.

10:27.893 --> 10:32.830
Why are you trying so hard
to be like him?

10:33.065 --> 10:38.002
We're almost to the airstrip.
We better get this thing in place.

10:58.357 --> 11:00.382
(moans)

11:00.459 --> 11:04.190
Lisa.

11:04.263 --> 11:07.289
Lisa, it's all right.

11:07.366 --> 11:09.231
Lisa. Baby. Lisa!

11:09.301 --> 11:12.464
Lisa! Lisa!

11:12.538 --> 11:14.597
N-N-N-Nina?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.507
I'm right here.
I'm right in front of you.

11:17.576 --> 11:18.907
I can't see anything!
I can't see anything at all!

11:18.978 --> 11:20.946
NINA: Lisa.

11:21.013 --> 11:25.177
Lisa!

11:25.251 --> 11:28.618
(Lisa moans loudly)

11:28.688 --> 11:29.586
All right? Can you see me now?

11:29.655 --> 11:31.714
What happened to you?

11:31.791 --> 11:36.728
I don't know.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.458
I was... somewhere else.

11:38.531 --> 11:42.092
I was somewhere else, and...

11:42.168 --> 11:45.296
wherever it was,

11:45.371 --> 11:46.668
I couldn't see a thing.

11:46.739 --> 11:49.264
She's always been a...

11:49.341 --> 11:54.278
she was a real good-Iooking baby
right from the start.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.680
And really smart.

11:58.751 --> 12:03.381
At seven months' old, she was
already playing peek-a-boo.

12:03.456 --> 12:08.393
I've got a video at home of her
taking her first steps.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.761
You should see that.

12:11.831 --> 12:14.800
I'd like to.

12:14.867 --> 12:19.804
We've always had this link,
you know, a connection.

12:21.974 --> 12:24.306
I've always known
exactly where she was,

12:24.376 --> 12:24.899
what she was thinking,
how she was feeling.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.280
I'd go to pick her up at school,
I'd stop off to get Tylenol...

12:28.347 --> 12:30.315
she'd walk out the building with
a runny nose and a headache.

12:30.382 --> 12:33.510
Sounds silly, doesn't it?

12:33.586 --> 12:36.054
I mean,
every mother has that.

12:36.122 --> 12:37.714
No, they don't.

12:37.790 --> 12:40.918
Man, I'm really, truly sorry.

12:40.993 --> 12:43.621
This is because Allie's blessed, right?

12:43.696 --> 12:44.856
These people that took her
want to know what she's all about.

12:44.930 --> 12:47.262
Yeah, pretty much.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.893
We'll do whatever we can
to help you get her back.

12:49.969 --> 12:53.962
I've got a couple of shirts
around that'll fit you.

12:54.039 --> 12:56.007
Over the years, a girl winds up
with a souvenir or two.

12:56.075 --> 13:01.012
Allie left this in the park

13:01.747 --> 13:05.376
when she ran away
at soccer practice.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.544
12 hours ago, there was
a bullet in my lung.

13:07.620 --> 13:12.557
I should be dead.

13:16.996 --> 13:17.519
Why doesn't it surprise me
that you're not?

13:17.596 --> 13:21.623
She's just a kid.

13:21.700 --> 13:24.635
She didn't ask for any of this.

13:24.703 --> 13:29.640
She shouldn't
have to do any of this.

13:30.543 --> 13:34.741
It's not fair! It's not fair at all!

13:34.814 --> 13:36.611
We'll get her back.

13:36.682 --> 13:38.980
How?

13:39.051 --> 13:42.578
ALLIE: <i>When you've done something</i>
<i>that you can't take back,</i>

13:42.655 --> 13:45.249
<i>something that</i>
<i>you don't understand,</i>

13:45.324 --> 13:50.261
<i>you start to hold tightly</i>

13:52.097 --> 13:55.430
<i>to the things</i>
<i>you do understand,</i>

13:55.501 --> 14:00.234
<i>and you try to make sense</i>
<i>out of everything you can.</i>

14:00.306 --> 14:05.243
<i>Because if you believed</i>
<i>that all you had to do</i>

14:10.916 --> 14:15.853
<i>to make things right</i>
<i>was to find a reason,</i>

14:20.659 --> 14:23.321
<i>but what happens</i>
<i>when you find the reasons</i>

14:23.395 --> 14:27.456
<i>and they are not your own?</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:30.400
<i>How do you find any comfort</i>
<i>or any sense in that?</i>

14:30.469 --> 14:32.369
They're on their way.

14:32.438 --> 14:37.375
We haven't had a chance to talk.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.572
What do you mean?

14:40.646 --> 14:43.740
About your father.

14:43.816 --> 14:47.513
There's nothing to say.

14:47.586 --> 14:51.784
You did what you had to do
for the project.

14:51.857 --> 14:56.794
Ha Ha. "For the project."

14:59.064 --> 15:03.763
When I was a kid,

15:03.836 --> 15:06.999
every time he went out of town,
I used to imagine a car wreck,

15:07.072 --> 15:10.166
something like that,

15:10.242 --> 15:12.733
just how much better our lives
would have been if he were gone.

15:12.811 --> 15:17.748
You've been inside a craft.

15:19.585 --> 15:24.522
Many times, yeah...

15:29.028 --> 15:33.965
that one at Groom Lake.

15:34.166 --> 15:36.862
That was beautiful...

15:36.936 --> 15:41.873
wasn't it?

15:45.611 --> 15:48.341
Yeah.

15:48.414 --> 15:53.351
That was my family legacy.

15:56.388 --> 15:56.854
The craft, the bodies.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.048
My grandfather's legacy.

15:58.123 --> 16:03.060
My father squandered all that.

16:09.401 --> 16:12.063
He had it right there in his hand,
and he let it all slip away.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.105
He couldn't stop them.

16:14.173 --> 16:17.267
He could have tried.

16:17.343 --> 16:17.741
You don't feel any remorse, do you?

16:17.810 --> 16:18.606
Do you think that
makes me a bad person?

16:18.677 --> 16:22.909
You did what you had to do.

16:22.982 --> 16:27.442
I heard about your father.

16:27.519 --> 16:30.352
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:30.422 --> 16:33.687
It was a terribly
unfortunate mistake.

16:33.759 --> 16:38.696
Mistake?

16:41.266 --> 16:46.203
You've got the girl?

16:55.247 --> 16:56.145
She's inside.

16:56.215 --> 17:01.152
So you really believe

17:02.421 --> 17:04.412
that thing you put on her head
is blocking her signal?

17:04.490 --> 17:06.185
Right now, they're in their ship,
scratching their little gray heads,

17:06.258 --> 17:08.249
going, "Where's our girl?"

17:08.327 --> 17:13.263
Then, when we take that shield off,
here they come.

17:14.465 --> 17:15.626
You're confident
we can take them down?

17:15.701 --> 17:17.430
Wherever they come from...

17:17.502 --> 17:18.731
the most distant star,
the furthest reaches of time...

17:18.804 --> 17:23.741
the moment they enter
our time and space, our reality,

17:23.976 --> 17:26.171
they're confronted by
the laws of our physics.

17:26.244 --> 17:27.473
You're sure of that?

17:27.546 --> 17:31.505
In 1947,
in Roswell, New Mexico,

17:31.583 --> 17:36.179
a ship came down when it collided
with a Mogul spy balloon... a balloon.

17:36.255 --> 17:37.779
Yeah, I'm pretty damn sure.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.915
You done a fine job.
We're indebted to you.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.187
What is this?

17:42.261 --> 17:47.198
SOLDIER:
Charlie company, move out!

17:48.300 --> 17:48.732
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of your country

17:48.801 --> 17:51.895
for your contribution to this effort.

17:51.970 --> 17:56.907
You've done your part,
Miss Crawford.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.535
The little girl's a part of
a military operation now.

18:00.612 --> 18:05.072
We'll take it from here.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.675
For three generations, my family's
been preparing for this.

18:07.753 --> 18:12.690
I've dedicated my career...
my life... to this.

18:14.993 --> 18:16.426
And don't think we don't appreciate it.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.055
In a matter of days,

18:19.131 --> 18:21.691
we may be able to set foot
inside one of their craft,

18:21.767 --> 18:23.291
to meet these beings,

18:23.368 --> 18:24.460
to find out what this
has all been about.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.025
If you think I'm gonna stand by

18:25.104 --> 18:30.041
while you take that opportunity away
from me, you're out of your mind.

18:32.277 --> 18:33.835
You don't really have a choice.

18:33.912 --> 18:38.645
You've been benched.
Go sit down. Grab some pine.

18:38.717 --> 18:42.448
What I'd like you to do now...

18:42.521 --> 18:45.490
I'd like you to clean up
the mess you made in Seattle.

18:45.557 --> 18:49.653
The doctor... she's a liability.
Marginalize her.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.696
And the girl's parents... put them
somewhere until this is over.

18:51.763 --> 18:52.957
Don't want them stirring the pot.

18:53.031 --> 18:57.525
We have people for that.

18:57.603 --> 19:00.766
You mentioned your father's
death was a mistake.

19:00.839 --> 19:05.003
People spend the rest of their lives
in prison for mistakes like that.

19:05.077 --> 19:09.514
Stay out of my way.

19:09.581 --> 19:14.518
You can ride with me, doctor.

19:16.955 --> 19:21.892
Brief me on the way.

19:25.063 --> 19:26.724
E-E-Excuse me?

19:26.798 --> 19:30.825
We need your expertise.

19:30.903 --> 19:31.198
I'm not giving you
a choice here, doctor.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.703
Come on, let's go. Now.

19:32.771 --> 19:37.708
Uh...

19:39.211 --> 19:44.148
Milo and I,
we drove everywhere.

19:45.817 --> 19:48.445
We'd ask people in diners
and in gas stations,

19:48.520 --> 19:49.145
and we got guys
from every band we know

19:49.221 --> 19:50.779
doing the same thing.

19:50.856 --> 19:51.845
Nothing.

19:51.924 --> 19:52.253
What about taking this public?

19:52.324 --> 19:54.485
They're not gonna come after you
with the whole world watching.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.824
I called Channel 4 news.

20:00.999 --> 20:03.024
I said my daughter was kidnapped
by a super-secret government agency.

20:03.101 --> 20:08.038
They... they said I should
call the police.

20:56.288 --> 20:58.313
I told them I didn't think
it would do any good,

20:58.390 --> 21:02.258
and they gave me another number...

21:02.327 --> 21:06.423
for Highline West
Psychiatric Hospital.

21:06.498 --> 21:11.435
We put an ad
in the <i>New York Times.</i>

21:12.738 --> 21:17.675
That's how Lisa gets
in touch with her uncle.

21:18.210 --> 21:23.147
Tom will be calling us soon.

21:28.020 --> 21:32.957
I'm cold.

21:35.027 --> 21:39.964
Shouldn't be much longer.

21:43.702 --> 21:48.435
Thank you.

21:48.507 --> 21:50.907
Lisa.

21:50.976 --> 21:55.913
(Allie's voice)
I'm scared, Charlie.

22:07.592 --> 22:10.356
I'm very, very scared.

22:10.429 --> 22:13.796
Just how powerful is this
little girl, doctor?

22:13.865 --> 22:16.925
She's demonstrated powers
beyond anything we imagined.

22:17.002 --> 22:21.939
She can manipulate time,

22:23.575 --> 22:28.512
she has amazing abilities to screen,

22:39.391 --> 22:44.328
to project images from our minds.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.138
Just how powerful is she?

23:03.215 --> 23:06.776
The question
you should be asking is,

23:06.852 --> 23:10.754
why is she letting us
take her anywhere at all?

23:10.822 --> 23:12.847
<i>You've reached the voice mail</i>
<i>for Dr. Chet Wakeman.</i>

23:12.924 --> 23:17.861
<i>Dr. Wakeman is out of range</i>
<i>of this cellular device.</i>

23:19.398 --> 23:24.335
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

23:40.118 --> 23:45.055
<i>General Beers' office.</i>

24:02.474 --> 24:07.411
This is Mary Crawford.

24:16.822 --> 24:21.759
Can you reach
the general for me?

24:21.927 --> 24:24.088
I'm sorry, Miss Crawford.
He's not available.

24:24.162 --> 24:27.029
Tell him I have new information
he'll want to hear about.

24:27.098 --> 24:32.035
ALLIE: <i>We had come to the time</i>
<i>I had always known was coming.</i>

24:32.103 --> 24:34.833
<i>I had always had</i>
<i>this feeling that, one day,</i>

24:34.906 --> 24:38.740
<i>I would have to do</i>
<i>something very hard.</i>

24:38.810 --> 24:43.747
<i>I just hoped that I could</i>
<i>find a way to do it</i>

24:44.316 --> 24:47.683
<i>without anyone getting hurt.</i>

24:47.752 --> 24:51.882
Sorry, sir. There's been a toxic spill.
You need to turn your vehicle around.

24:51.957 --> 24:55.017
No one's allowed to go through.

24:55.093 --> 25:00.030
Let's get the gate.

25:00.632 --> 25:02.896
How you doin' in there?

25:02.968 --> 25:05.493
I'm all right.

25:09.908 --> 25:14.845
Can I ask you something?

25:16.014 --> 25:19.745
I heard that you let them take you,

25:19.818 --> 25:24.755
that you came right up to them
and said you'd go with them.

25:26.925 --> 25:31.726
Uh-huh.

25:31.796 --> 25:34.162
I also heard that you can do things,

25:34.232 --> 25:37.463
kind of like magic or something.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.299
Is that true?

25:39.371 --> 25:40.429
Yes.

25:40.505 --> 25:41.062
So you've got all of that power,
why didn't you just stop them?

25:41.139 --> 25:42.538
I was afraid
they'd hurt other people.

25:42.607 --> 25:45.542
You're one brave little girl.

25:45.610 --> 25:48.306
I don't feel very brave right now.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.245
Hey...

25:50.315 --> 25:55.252
maybe later, I could come back
with a book or something.

25:55.720 --> 26:00.657
Did you ever read
<i>Huckleberry Finn?</i>

26:04.696 --> 26:09.633
No, I never have.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.554
Well, I've got my copy
in my duffle.

26:39.631 --> 26:43.123
I always carry it with me.

26:43.201 --> 26:45.635
It was my mom's favorite book.

26:45.704 --> 26:48.002
She'd bake us Toll House cookies,

26:48.073 --> 26:49.665
and we'd share the whole plate
of them while she read.

26:49.741 --> 26:53.541
If it wouldn't make you
too sad to remember her...

26:53.612 --> 26:54.738
I'd like to hear the story.

26:54.813 --> 26:56.075
No, it wouldn't make me sad at all.

26:56.147 --> 26:58.775
It would be nice to remember her.

26:58.850 --> 27:03.787
We're calling the operation
"Dropping the Dishes."

27:04.155 --> 27:06.885
The three Humvees
equipped with the missiles

27:06.958 --> 27:09.256
will be here, here, and here,

27:09.327 --> 27:11.261
camo nets above 'em.

27:11.329 --> 27:16.266
The target, gentlemen,
will be in the air.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.199
It will be big.

27:18.269 --> 27:21.636
Observation posts here
on the mountains for early warning.

27:21.706 --> 27:26.643
Two men to each O.P.

27:39.824 --> 27:44.761
We're gonna try to take
this thing down intact, sir?

28:02.480 --> 28:07.417
That's the plan.

28:12.624 --> 28:15.593
Once we get it down, sir,
how do we find these guys?

28:15.660 --> 28:20.597
Y'all have seen the S-2 briefing video.
You know as much as I do.

28:27.138 --> 28:32.075
All right, they can do some
pretty incredible things.

28:36.381 --> 28:41.318
They've taken people through walls.

28:46.491 --> 28:51.428
They can make you see things
that are not there.

28:56.367 --> 29:01.304
But no problem, right? We're the best.

29:07.145 --> 29:12.082
Y'all are about to fight an enemy

29:28.833 --> 29:33.770
the likes of which
no soldier has ever seen.

30:46.244 --> 30:50.840
I can't tell you how it will go,

30:50.915 --> 30:53.679
but I can tell you this...

30:53.751 --> 30:57.278
you're about to earn
a place in history.

30:57.355 --> 31:02.292
She's completely normal.

31:02.994 --> 31:07.931
No fluctuation
in brain-wave pattern,

31:20.144 --> 31:25.081
nothing in her blood chemistry.

31:27.919 --> 31:32.856
Her biology is human.

31:43.468 --> 31:44.867
Of course it is.

31:44.936 --> 31:49.873
We won't find anything.

32:56.808 --> 33:01.745
The part of her that isn't human
is capable of perfect mimicry.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.614
Then what are we looking for?

33:04.682 --> 33:09.619
I don't know.

33:14.325 --> 33:17.817
SOLDIER: Any questions?

33:17.895 --> 33:22.832
Is there anything we can do to
maximize our cone of fire, sir?

33:26.270 --> 33:29.398
I'd aim for the center
of the damn thing and pray.

33:29.474 --> 33:31.772
Any other questions?

33:31.843 --> 33:36.780
Uh, General?

33:37.648 --> 33:40.549
General.

33:40.618 --> 33:40.913
I need to talk to you
about the little girl... Allie.

33:40.985 --> 33:45.922
Something wrong?

33:47.725 --> 33:50.819
Her powers are just
beginning to manifest.

33:50.895 --> 33:55.832
We need to protect her
for further study.

33:57.135 --> 34:00.263
So you're uncomfortable with
the notion of using her for bait.

34:00.338 --> 34:04.069
Let's not think of this,
then, in terms of fishing.

34:04.142 --> 34:09.079
In fishing, you put a worm on a hook,

34:11.581 --> 34:16.518
fish bites the worm, takes the hook,
the worm's toast.

34:24.529 --> 34:28.625
But this is hunting country,

34:28.699 --> 34:30.667
so think of her
more as a... a salt lick.

34:30.735 --> 34:35.672
A buck comes up to the salt,
boom, you shoot the buck.

34:36.808 --> 34:39.299
No harm at all to the salt lick.

34:39.377 --> 34:42.835
General, I, uh...

34:42.914 --> 34:47.179
I think there's been
a miscommunication here.

34:47.251 --> 34:52.188
A miscommunication. Really?

34:53.558 --> 34:55.116
Yeah. See, um,

34:55.193 --> 34:56.888
my understanding of the plan...

34:56.960 --> 35:01.898
and I did design the plan...

35:03.167 --> 35:06.261
an explosion is to be
detonated above the craft.

35:06.337 --> 35:11.274
The effect is to bring
the ship down intact.

35:12.043 --> 35:15.479
We're not trying to, uh, bag a buck,

35:15.546 --> 35:16.945
as you so elegantly put it.

35:17.014 --> 35:17.912
We're trying to collect
specimens for the zoo.

35:17.982 --> 35:22.919
My orders are
to take down their craft

35:33.331 --> 35:38.268
and to replace the craft
and the bodies you people lost

35:40.338 --> 35:44.934
and, if possible,

35:45.009 --> 35:49.946
to take the occupants
of the craft alive,

36:13.771 --> 36:18.708
and if not, well, we'll have
more bodies to study.

36:26.751 --> 36:31.688
This is an opportunity
to communicate with beings

36:36.227 --> 36:41.164
from another world.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.901
We're on the brink of the single
most important moment

36:46.971 --> 36:50.634
in human history.

36:50.708 --> 36:55.645
As far as I'm concerned,
we're at war.

36:57.415 --> 37:02.352
These beings have taken
our citizens against their will,

37:02.620 --> 37:04.713
they've invaded our air space,
our lives, even our gene pool.

37:04.789 --> 37:07.781
These are unparalleled
acts of aggression.

37:07.858 --> 37:12.795
We're at war here, fighting an enemy
we don't understand at all,

37:18.035 --> 37:22.972
so I'll do whatever I have to do.

37:23.708 --> 37:28.645
You guys think
these things will do the job?

37:33.918 --> 37:37.945
You men are outclassed,
out-equipped,

37:38.022 --> 37:42.959
and probably outnumbered.

37:43.127 --> 37:47.029
Plan A, then, would be for
the missiles to do their job

37:47.098 --> 37:50.397
and take these things
out of the sky.

37:50.468 --> 37:53.665
Plan B would be for you
to stick your head

37:53.738 --> 37:58.675
between your legs
and kiss your asses good-bye.

38:03.247 --> 38:06.978
There is no plan C, gentlemen.

38:07.051 --> 38:11.283
(laughter)

38:11.355 --> 38:16.292
You know about
all the things they do?

38:16.827 --> 38:20.991
The probes and stuff, man?

38:21.065 --> 38:26.002
I hear they show you stuff
that'll rip your brain apart.

38:29.340 --> 38:34.277
I heard one of these came down
in Nebraska two years ago...

38:35.146 --> 38:37.876
took a squad

38:37.948 --> 38:42.385
and wiped them off
the face of the earth.

38:42.453 --> 38:47.049
I think this is some sort
of training exercise

38:47.124 --> 38:50.787
in psychological warfare,

38:50.861 --> 38:55.798
to see how we do with
an impossible situation.

38:59.537 --> 39:04.338
- You saying there aren't any aliens?
- That's what I'm saying.

39:04.408 --> 39:06.205
You've all seen
the S-2 briefing videos.

39:06.277 --> 39:08.677
I saw the alien autopsy video, too.

39:08.746 --> 39:11.442
Dude, that was awesome.

39:11.515 --> 39:12.607
That looked more real
than any of our stuff.

39:12.683 --> 39:13.672
I met this guy once, special ops,
had to debrief these two marines

39:13.751 --> 39:16.345
that were taken right through
their barracks walls.

39:16.420 --> 39:20.288
Showed up a couple hours later
with scars all over their bodies.

39:20.358 --> 39:25.295
They were never right again.

39:29.266 --> 39:32.633
See, it's drug tests.

39:32.703 --> 39:35.672
Chemical warfare,
something like that.

39:35.740 --> 39:36.798
We're not fighting any aliens.
We're like lab rats being tested.

39:36.874 --> 39:38.068
You don't think we're gonna
storm a flying saucer?

39:38.142 --> 39:41.168
Tried to get
my head around it, but, no.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.338
I think this is some very deep,
weird zone of "don't ask."

39:43.414 --> 39:48.351
Either way, we're toast.

39:48.452 --> 39:51.615
Ah! Get it off!
Get it off! Get it off!

39:51.689 --> 39:56.626
(all chuckle)

39:56.794 --> 40:01.731
I've got this thing
about roaches, all right?

40:02.333 --> 40:07.270
(laughter)

40:08.706 --> 40:13.643
And this is the man
who's going to save the world

40:15.246 --> 40:18.147
from the alien menace.

40:18.215 --> 40:19.739
(laughter)

40:19.817 --> 40:23.344
Back to work.

40:23.421 --> 40:28.358
"They judged it was him, anyway.

40:50.347 --> 40:54.909
"Said this drowned man
was just his size

40:54.985 --> 40:59.149
"and was ragged
and had uncommon long hair,

40:59.223 --> 41:02.454
"which was all like pap.

41:02.526 --> 41:04.994
"But they couldn't make nothin'
out of the face,

41:05.062 --> 41:08.088
"because it had been
in the water so long.

41:08.165 --> 41:11.794
"Weren't much like a face at all.

41:11.869 --> 41:16.636
"They said he was floating
on his back in the water.

41:16.707 --> 41:21.644
"They took him
and buried him on the bank.

41:34.391 --> 41:36.256
"But I weren't comfortable long

41:36.327 --> 41:41.264
"because I happened
to think of somethin'.

41:45.202 --> 41:50.139
"I knowed mighty well
that a drowned man

42:31.882 --> 42:34.442
"don't float on his back,
but on his face.

42:34.518 --> 42:38.181
So I knowed then
that this weren't pap."

42:38.255 --> 42:43.192
This isn't getting too scary, is it?

42:49.600 --> 42:52.160
It's good. I like it.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.703
I remember
I would picture that river.

42:53.771 --> 42:55.830
When I imagined it,

42:55.906 --> 42:57.601
it was all kind of dark and mossy,

42:57.675 --> 42:59.734
trees hanging down and stuff.

42:59.810 --> 43:02.244
Not like those pictures you see
of Tom and Huck fishing.

43:02.313 --> 43:04.645
Oh, I'd get so scared, but I liked it, too.

43:04.715 --> 43:05.511
And my mom would
get under the covers with me

43:05.583 --> 43:07.778
and read these parts.

43:07.851 --> 43:09.318
She was nice, your mom.

43:09.386 --> 43:11.616
Yeah, she was.

43:11.689 --> 43:13.418
My mom, too.

43:13.490 --> 43:14.616
My mom's great.

43:14.692 --> 43:16.626
You want me to go on?

43:16.694 --> 43:21.427
Yes, please.

43:21.498 --> 43:21.964
"We played robber
now and then about a month,

43:22.032 --> 43:25.058
"and I resigned.

43:25.135 --> 43:27.501
"All the boys did.

43:27.571 --> 43:28.731
"We hadn't robbed nobody,
hadn't killed any people,

43:28.806 --> 43:30.137
"but only just pretended.

43:30.207 --> 43:32.607
"We used to
hop out of the woods

43:32.676 --> 43:34.200
"and go charging down
on hog drovers.

43:34.278 --> 43:35.905
"Women in carts taking
garden stuff to market...

43:35.980 --> 43:39.211
we never hogged any of 'em."

43:39.283 --> 43:41.410
(chuckling)
I appreciate that, Colonel.

43:41.485 --> 43:44.511
I thought with the history our families
have shared over the years,

43:44.588 --> 43:47.318
you could give me
an off-the-record location.

43:47.391 --> 43:49.222
Yeah, I understand what
"need-to-know basis" means,

43:49.293 --> 43:52.490
you jackass.

43:52.563 --> 43:53.723
We need your help.

43:53.797 --> 43:58.257
Come in.

43:58.335 --> 43:59.097
Please, come in. Sit down.

43:59.169 --> 43:59.726
Close the curtains.

43:59.803 --> 44:00.565
You don't have to worry.
No one's coming here.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.401
What do you mean?

44:02.473 --> 44:04.703
I work for them, Charlie.

44:04.775 --> 44:06.709
I was the one who called them.

44:06.777 --> 44:10.304
You told them about Allie.

44:10.381 --> 44:12.440
Lisa...

44:12.516 --> 44:15.451
Just tell me where she is.

44:15.519 --> 44:17.043
Please, Harriet, tell me
where they took Allie.

44:17.121 --> 44:18.486
I don't know. I tried to call them.

44:18.555 --> 44:19.021
All the numbers I've been given
are disconnected.

44:19.089 --> 44:19.885
I have no way of finding them.

44:19.957 --> 44:21.481
We trusted you,
everyone in the group.

44:21.558 --> 44:23.651
We put our trust in you,
and you betrayed it.

44:23.727 --> 44:28.664
They told me I was helping.

44:32.870 --> 44:37.807
They told me they had proof
that people who had been taken

44:58.862 --> 45:03.799
were in greater danger
than they knew. I thought...

45:12.242 --> 45:13.436
You thought you were helping?!

45:13.510 --> 45:18.447
You told them Charlie was here,
you told them Allie was with us,

45:20.651 --> 45:25.588
and now they have her!

45:33.964 --> 45:38.901
Lisa, I am so sorry.

45:41.038 --> 45:45.634
I want you to put me back under.

45:45.709 --> 45:50.203
Allie and I, we have this link.

45:50.280 --> 45:55.217
Yes, I believe that's real.

46:04.695 --> 46:09.632
In regression,
I've had those moments

46:12.870 --> 46:17.807
where I feel Allie,

46:49.239 --> 46:54.176
where I get that sense
of knowing where she is.

47:54.671 --> 47:56.696
Yes.

47:56.773 --> 47:59.833
I've been experiencing
things like that again

47:59.910 --> 48:02.879
since they took Allie.

48:02.946 --> 48:05.278
I keep getting this sense of knowing
where she is and what she's doing.

48:05.349 --> 48:09.285
It's very strong. l...

48:09.353 --> 48:10.911
I want you to help me find her.

48:10.988 --> 48:11.545
We'd have to go pretty deep.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.487
We've gone there before,

48:13.557 --> 48:15.286
but frankly, Lisa,
I'm a little over my head here.

48:15.359 --> 48:17.759
Can you help me get there?

48:17.828 --> 48:18.556
We're dealing with something
that I don't fully understand.

48:18.629 --> 48:22.622
Even if I am able
to access it...

48:22.699 --> 48:24.894
hypnosis of this sort
can be very dangerous.

48:24.968 --> 48:27.368
Are you sure
you're ready for that?

48:27.437 --> 48:29.496
I'll go wherever I have to
if I can get my daughter back.

48:29.573 --> 48:32.041
You have to do this for me.

48:32.109 --> 48:33.371
You owe me that much.

48:33.443 --> 48:37.277
ALLIE: <i>Most of</i>
<i>the fights people have</i>

48:37.347 --> 48:39.315
<i>are about something simple</i>...

48:39.383 --> 48:42.580
<i>you want something</i>
<i>the other person has,</i>

48:42.653 --> 48:42.948
<i>or maybe they're afraid</i>
<i>you're going to want it,</i>

48:43.020 --> 48:46.421
<i>and they go after you first.</i>

48:46.490 --> 48:48.583
<i>People always think that if they win,</i>

48:48.659 --> 48:50.650
<i>then that's the end,</i>

48:50.727 --> 48:52.888
<i>everything will be all right</i>
<i>from then on.</i>

48:52.963 --> 48:55.431
<i>But everything changes,</i>

48:55.499 --> 49:00.436
<i>and tomorrow, the thing</i>
<i>you were fighting for</i>

49:01.338 --> 49:03.704
<i>will just be a memory.</i>

49:03.774 --> 49:07.471
<i>Like everything else,</i>
<i>it's already happened.</i>

49:07.544 --> 49:09.034
They're ready to take
the shield off, doctor.

49:09.112 --> 49:13.173
What we're going to do
is extremely delicate.

49:13.250 --> 49:14.717
It would be easier for
Lisa and me to find a way in

49:14.785 --> 49:19.154
if there wasn't
anyone else in the room.

49:19.222 --> 49:24.159
It's all right.

49:27.764 --> 49:31.632
And a third deep breath...

49:31.702 --> 49:34.967
Now I want you to go to that place
where you and Allie find each other.

49:35.038 --> 49:38.769
Can you find it for me?

49:38.842 --> 49:42.334
(inhales deeply)

49:42.412 --> 49:44.539
Yes.

49:44.614 --> 49:45.808
SOLDIER: "And so we would lay
in ambuscade,

49:45.882 --> 49:50.819
"as he called it,

49:53.323 --> 49:57.987
"and kill the lot
and scoop the things.

49:58.061 --> 50:02.998
"He said we must
slick up our swords and guns

50:22.519 --> 50:22.780
and get ready."

50:22.853 --> 50:23.342
Okay, I'm going to take
this thing off your head

50:23.420 --> 50:23.977
in just a moment.

50:24.054 --> 50:25.646
Now, it's not very bright in here,

50:25.722 --> 50:26.984
but it may hurt your eyes
at first, okay?

50:27.057 --> 50:28.684
Okay.

50:28.759 --> 50:31.694
Okay.

50:31.762 --> 50:34.060
Now what do you see?

50:34.131 --> 50:34.597
Darkness.
All I see is darkness.

50:34.664 --> 50:36.359
l... I can make out something.

50:36.433 --> 50:39.630
LISA: There are people watching.

50:39.703 --> 50:42.433
It doesn't feel good.

50:42.506 --> 50:45.566
There are all these people.

50:45.642 --> 50:46.040
They're waiting
for something to happen.

50:46.109 --> 50:46.905
They want something.

50:46.977 --> 50:49.343
They're waiting for something.

50:49.413 --> 50:50.573
Do you know where you are?

50:50.647 --> 50:53.980
It looks like a hospital...

50:54.051 --> 50:54.745
but it's not.

50:54.818 --> 50:56.911
It smells kind of moldy...

50:56.987 --> 50:58.579
it's like an attic.

50:58.655 --> 50:58.916
DR PENZLER: Now what do you see?

50:58.989 --> 51:01.457
Ugh!

51:01.525 --> 51:06.360
But I don't know if it'll happen.

51:06.430 --> 51:09.024
There's a lot of anger here
and a lot of fear.

51:09.099 --> 51:11.124
Lisa... Lisa.

51:11.201 --> 51:13.761
Charlie?

51:13.837 --> 51:15.327
I don't know if they're
gonna get what they want,

51:15.405 --> 51:16.565
but I know they're
going to keep her.

51:16.640 --> 51:17.868
They're going to keep her
until they get what they want.

51:17.941 --> 51:19.909
So what happens now?

51:19.976 --> 51:21.307
We wait.

51:21.378 --> 51:26.315
How long should we wait?

51:38.695 --> 51:39.423
I don't know.

51:39.496 --> 51:40.622
You believe they'll come?

51:40.697 --> 51:42.756
Absolutely.

51:42.833 --> 51:44.095
But then again,
I believe a lot of things.

51:44.167 --> 51:44.826
He threatens to become
a major pain in the ass.

51:44.901 --> 51:47.233
NINA: If they went for Dr. Penzler,
they'll be coming for you next.

51:47.304 --> 51:52.241
I don't care about that.

51:53.577 --> 51:56.774
All I care about is finding Allie.

51:56.847 --> 51:57.609
Where is she?

51:57.681 --> 52:01.208
I was with her in this room. It's...

52:01.284 --> 52:02.080
it's a room.

52:02.152 --> 52:02.948
Uh... Bare walls,
peeling wallpaper,

52:05.188 --> 52:07.315
like a... farm.

52:07.390 --> 52:10.723
Why a farm?

52:10.794 --> 52:13.820
The way the room
looks and... feels.

52:13.897 --> 52:18.527
(sighs)

52:18.602 --> 52:21.469
Something on the wall...
license plates...

52:21.538 --> 52:26.475
old, rusted license plates

52:27.310 --> 52:31.679
and a calendar with a picture
of a tractor on it.

52:31.748 --> 52:33.079
There were all these people.

52:33.150 --> 52:38.087
A man I saw the time
they tried to pick me up,

52:41.758 --> 52:46.695
but there was someone
in uniform...

52:50.901 --> 52:53.699
You said there were
license plates on the wall?

52:53.770 --> 52:56.671
Yeah, old ones.

52:56.740 --> 52:57.365
What state?

52:57.440 --> 53:02.377
Let me think.

53:02.979 --> 53:07.245
North...

53:07.317 --> 53:12.254
North...

53:13.957 --> 53:15.754
North Dakota! North Dakota!

53:15.825 --> 53:17.417
That's a start.

53:17.494 --> 53:18.688
North Dakota and a farmhouse

53:18.762 --> 53:21.390
doesn't exactly
narrow it down that much.

53:21.464 --> 53:23.830
Wallington's Feed and Grain.

53:23.900 --> 53:28.837
Wallington's Feed and Grain!

53:34.077 --> 53:34.406
The calendar on the wall!
That was the name of the place!

53:34.477 --> 53:34.875
North Dakota.
I don't know what city.

53:34.945 --> 53:35.741
The listing's for
Wallington's Feed and Grain.

53:35.812 --> 53:40.749
You're sure?

53:45.021 --> 53:46.249
Nothing.

53:46.323 --> 53:51.260
In the whole state
of North Dakota, there's nothing.

53:52.562 --> 53:55.395
Ask yourselves,

53:55.465 --> 54:00.402
what would Maddie Hayes
and David Addison do?

54:20.190 --> 54:21.885
And they say that watching
five hours of TV a day

54:21.958 --> 54:25.951
for 26 years is a bad thing.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.894
<i>This intelligence is of</i>
<i>an other-than-human form.</i>

54:27.964 --> 54:32.901
<i>They let us see what they</i>
<i>want us to see, nothing more.</i>

54:36.806 --> 54:41.402
<i>Your govemment knows this.</i>

54:41.478 --> 54:45.608
<i>Gulf Breeze, Exeter, Dayton</i>...

54:45.682 --> 54:48.981
I love this guy.
He believes in everything.

54:49.052 --> 54:51.316
The scary part is how often
he comes close to the truth.

54:51.388 --> 54:54.789
<i>... our govemment has been</i>
<i>involved in a massive conspiracy</i>

54:54.858 --> 54:58.316
<i>to cover this up.</i>

54:58.395 --> 55:02.161
<i>Call me and tell me your story.</i>
<i>This is William Jeffries.</i>

55:02.232 --> 55:04.427
<i>Talk to me, and I'll talk to you.</i>

55:04.501 --> 55:05.991
<i>Oh, hi. This is Theresa,</i>
<i>from Pocatello, Idaho,</i>

55:06.069 --> 55:08.469
<i>and I just have to tell you,</i>
<i>I'm so glad you're here,</i>

55:08.538 --> 55:11.996
<i>because I was abducted</i>
<i>last September...</i>

55:12.075 --> 55:16.910
Snack time.

55:16.980 --> 55:20.211
<i>I tried to talk to everybody about this.</i>
<i>I tried the govemment</i>...

55:20.283 --> 55:25.220
I live on bad coffee

55:46.676 --> 55:51.613
and stale Oreos
from the vending machine.

55:53.350 --> 55:58.287
THERESA: <i>Thank God</i>
<i>you're on the air.</i>

56:01.891 --> 56:04.985
(telephone rings)

56:05.061 --> 56:09.998
Yes?

56:10.200 --> 56:14.637
Little girl's light just came back on.

56:14.704 --> 56:16.695
North Dakota, Benson County,
just outside of Brinsmade.

56:16.773 --> 56:17.705
- Program worked.
- Thank you.

56:17.774 --> 56:19.469
ALLIE: <i>My mother used</i>
<i>to sing to me a lot,</i>

56:19.542 --> 56:23.535
<i>folk songs mostly,</i>

56:23.613 --> 56:25.012
<i>and things she liked</i>
<i>when she was a little girl.</i>

56:25.081 --> 56:28.642
<i>There was this one song</i>
<i>called</i> Further Along

56:28.718 --> 56:32.085
<i>that always made me</i>
<i>feel better when I was sad.</i>

56:32.155 --> 56:37.092
<i>"Further along,</i>

56:37.427 --> 56:41.158
<i>"Further along,</i>
<i>we'll understand why.</i>

56:41.231 --> 56:42.459
<i>"Cheer up, my brother,</i>
<i>live in the sunshine.</i>

56:42.532 --> 56:42.759
<i>We'll understand it all,</i>
<i>by and by."</i>

56:42.832 --> 56:43.298
<i>When you get to wondering</i>
<i>too much about things,</i>

56:43.366 --> 56:45.960
<i>a song like that can really help a lot.</i>

56:46.035 --> 56:47.502
When we find her,
she's gonna want that.

56:47.570 --> 56:50.505
She'll be glad you brought it.

56:50.573 --> 56:52.871
Thanks for the book.

56:52.942 --> 56:57.003
Well, I figured now that you
had that thing off,

56:57.080 --> 56:58.104
you could read it for yourself
if you wanted.

56:58.181 --> 57:03.118
I was kind of hoping you would
keep reading it to me.

57:06.055 --> 57:08.080
Sure. I mean, I'd like that.

57:08.158 --> 57:13.095
Me, too.

57:13.596 --> 57:16.190
Can I ask you something?

57:16.266 --> 57:19.667
Sure.

57:19.736 --> 57:24.673
Are they really
gonna come and get you?

57:26.309 --> 57:28.641
I don't know.

57:28.711 --> 57:33.648
Probably something like that.

57:41.157 --> 57:45.526
That sure will be something to see.

57:45.595 --> 57:50.532
"Well, three or four months
run along,

57:55.104 --> 58:00.041
"and it was well
into the winter now.

58:19.128 --> 58:23.656
"I'd been to school

58:23.733 --> 58:27.430
"and could spell and read
and write just a little

58:27.504 --> 58:28.596
"and could say
the multiplication table...

Just before it gets dark

58:29.572 --> 58:30.664
When the light
still hangs in the sky

58:30.740 --> 58:32.605
The day's not quite come

58:32.675 --> 58:35.109
All its promises
still in your own eyes

58:35.178 --> 58:35.576
Between the time
your mother calls

58:35.645 --> 58:37.613
Thanks.

58:37.680 --> 58:38.908
And the time
you put the ball away

58:38.982 --> 58:39.346
SOLDIER: "But before the cold
weather, I used to slide out...

58:39.415 --> 58:41.349
There's a lifetime to be lived

58:41.417 --> 58:46.354
And a world where every dream
is here to stay

58:46.623 --> 58:47.180
Just before the night comes

58:47.257 --> 58:52.194
And you run back
to the safety of your world

58:52.262 --> 58:52.728
You're sure you've never heard of it...
Wallington Feed and Grain?

58:52.795 --> 58:54.763
No, I'm sorry.

58:54.831 --> 58:56.628
Just before it gets time

58:56.699 --> 58:58.360
Are you folks asking about Wallington?

58:58.434 --> 58:59.867
Yeah.

58:59.936 --> 59:02.905
Harry Wallington, he went bust in '75.

59:02.972 --> 59:04.769
'75?

59:04.841 --> 59:06.172
Had a place up in Brinsmade.

59:06.242 --> 59:11.179
I used to stop in on my way
back from fishing with my boys.

59:13.182 --> 59:13.546
Good prices, quality products.

59:13.616 --> 59:15.015
What's a couple of young folks
doing asking about a store

59:15.084 --> 59:16.608
that went under when
you were still in diapers?

59:16.686 --> 59:17.710
Thanks.

59:17.787 --> 59:20.517
Thanks a lot.

59:20.590 --> 59:22.251
Well, nothin' lasts forever

59:22.325 --> 59:27.262
But those moments
keep forever far away

59:27.664 --> 59:30.792
You didn't mention
that it was an old calendar.

59:30.867 --> 59:34.997
Sorry, my super-vision's
a little rusty.

59:35.071 --> 59:35.435
We're gonna find her, Lisa.

59:35.505 --> 59:35.937
We're going to Brinsmade.

59:36.005 --> 59:36.903
Are you from there?

59:36.973 --> 59:38.600
No. We're visiting a sick cousin.

59:38.675 --> 59:43.612
Brinsmade's been evacuated.

59:52.922 --> 59:55.482
You'll find your family member
at the high-school gym in Leeds.

59:55.558 --> 59:57.423
Evacuated? Why?

59:57.493 --> 01:00:02.430
Toxic spill. A truck collided with a train.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:04.298
What kind of spill?

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:06.767
They don't tell me. They just tell me
to keep the cars out.

01:00:06.836 --> 01:00:08.269
You're not afraid you're
standing downwind of something?

01:00:08.338 --> 01:00:10.329
You folks turn around
and do like I said.

01:00:10.406 --> 01:00:14.103
You'll find your
family member in Leeds.

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:22.908
Move along. Let's go.

01:00:22.986 --> 01:00:27.923
Hold on tight

01:00:28.858 --> 01:00:30.917
And I promise you, baby

01:00:30.994 --> 01:00:33.861
It'll all be all right

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:38.390
I promise you, baby

01:00:38.468 --> 01:00:43.405
It'll all be all right

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:15.170
Okay, so where are they?

01:01:28.918 --> 01:01:30.442
I mean, they took that thing
off the little girl's head last night,

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:34.718
so where are they?

01:01:34.791 --> 01:01:39.728
When I was in Afghanistan last year.
This was all we did... sit and wait.

01:01:58.014 --> 01:02:02.951
Come out and kill me already.
I don't care.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:33.915
Don't make me sit here
and think about what might happen.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:43.792
You would have been lost
at the Alamo, my friend.

01:02:52.735 --> 01:02:57.672
Day one of that siege,

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:22.025
I'd have been the first one
over that wall.

01:03:22.098 --> 01:03:23.622
So what's the deal
with the little girl, Pierce?

01:03:23.699 --> 01:03:28.636
I mean, you been with her.

01:03:30.106 --> 01:03:34.042
She's special.

01:03:34.110 --> 01:03:39.047
Well, what's so special about her?

01:03:40.516 --> 01:03:45.453
You have to be in the room with her.

01:03:45.855 --> 01:03:50.792
You guys are gonna think
this is really weird...

01:03:55.731 --> 01:04:00.668
We're in a field waiting for
a flying saucer to land.

01:04:00.803 --> 01:04:05.536
How weird could anything
you tell us be?

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:07.405
I've told you guys about my mom,

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:09.000
what a good cook she was,
the cookies she used to bake.

01:04:09.078 --> 01:04:13.538
We have heard the tales.

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.948
My mom died in 1998.

01:04:16.018 --> 01:04:18.077
And you start to lose 'em
after they die...

01:04:18.154 --> 01:04:22.090
your loved ones.

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:24.217
I mean, their memories just...

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:28.753
start to fade in your head.

01:04:28.831 --> 01:04:33.029
I don't mean events...
I remember birthdays,

01:04:33.102 --> 01:04:36.230
picnics, everything like that.

01:04:36.305 --> 01:04:39.433
I mean, your actual
mental picture of the person.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:44.445
I'm reading to Allie,

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:47.173
just helping her pass the time.

01:04:47.250 --> 01:04:48.774
She's just a scared little kid,

01:04:48.851 --> 01:04:50.648
and she misses her mom,

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:55.657
just like I miss mine.

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:56.577
The book I'm reading,

01:06:57.246 --> 01:07:02.183
it's something my mom
used to read to me.

01:07:13.796 --> 01:07:18.733
It's just like
my mom's there with us,

01:07:24.206 --> 01:07:28.666
that's all I'm trying to say.

01:07:28.744 --> 01:07:32.145
And you attribute this
somehow to the little girl?

01:07:32.214 --> 01:07:37.151
I'm just saying,
you have to be there with her.

01:07:39.688 --> 01:07:44.625
You can't put it into words,

01:07:56.238 --> 01:07:57.762
but if you spend some time
with her, you'll get it.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:59.899
I can promise you that.

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:03.103
Thank you.

01:08:03.179 --> 01:08:04.168
Sorry about how
all this worked out.

01:08:04.246 --> 01:08:05.770
If you guys want to go
hunting in a couple of weeks,

01:08:05.848 --> 01:08:07.907
they should have
the spill cleaned up.

01:08:07.983 --> 01:08:08.711
There was no toxic spill.
I can tell you that.

01:08:08.784 --> 01:08:11.116
How the hell you know that?

01:08:11.187 --> 01:08:16.124
Because I worked
that railroad 19 years.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:29.529
You know what they haul
on those lines?

01:08:29.604 --> 01:08:34.064
Lumber and steel.

01:08:34.143 --> 01:08:39.080
Nothing but lumber and steel.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:43.148
Now, I'm up there
at Cranberry Lake

01:08:43.219 --> 01:08:46.346
with Michael and Tony,

01:08:46.421 --> 01:08:51.359
and I'm trying to explain
a little of my philosophy

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:54.625
of life in the woods.

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:59.634
A couple of fellas
up from Grand Forks

01:09:00.301 --> 01:09:05.035
desperate to kill something
before the weekend is over,

01:09:05.107 --> 01:09:06.904
and I'm trying to explain that

01:09:06.975 --> 01:09:10.377
that's not really what
hunting's all about.

01:09:10.446 --> 01:09:13.040
Is this a story
that goes someplace,

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:18.051
or is this "Dewey's
Meaning of Life, Part 7"?

01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:22.384
The point is, the three of us
are sitting around the campfire

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:26.656
and I'm explaining my philosophy,

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.323
and this Humvee pulls up,
a bunch of soldiers get out

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:34.335
and tell us to head on
back to civilization.

01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:39.469
On account of the spill.

01:09:39.542 --> 01:09:42.670
A toxic spill...
if there had been one...

01:09:42.745 --> 01:09:45.612
they might have told us
to evacuate the area

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.670
and then gone on
about their business.

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.273
Not this bunch.

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:53.287
They just stood there

01:09:57.159 --> 01:10:02.096
the whole time
it took us to strike camp,

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:17.845
and then they damn near
followed us

01:10:30.526 --> 01:10:35.463
all the way out of the woods.

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:41.068
Excuse me.

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:46.941
I'm looking for a Mr. Clayton.

01:11:03.359 --> 01:11:05.418
- Over there.
- That's him?

01:11:05.494 --> 01:11:10.431
Thanks.

01:11:12.968 --> 01:11:17.905
You're Mr. Clayton?

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:22.977
(laughs)

01:11:30.052 --> 01:11:32.919
That would be my dad.
I'm Dewey.

01:11:32.988 --> 01:11:34.785
We'd like to hire your services.

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:39.794
Oh, you lookin' for a guide?

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.264
We were told
that you're the best.

01:11:50.339 --> 01:11:55.276
And you two want to go huntin'?

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:24.171
In a way, yes.

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:26.298
Well, you're out of luck.
We're shut down.

01:12:26.375 --> 01:12:27.637
Damn government's locked us
out of our own woods.

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:28.972
We know that.

01:12:29.044 --> 01:12:30.841
But you've got some reason

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:32.175
you want to go up in there, anyway?

01:12:32.247 --> 01:12:34.841
Why don't you step
into my office?

01:12:34.917 --> 01:12:36.976
Now what have we got
out in those woods

01:12:37.052 --> 01:12:41.989
that you two are so anxious
to go huntin' for?

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:46.320
Our daughter.

01:13:55.531 --> 01:13:59.991
She's lost in the woods?

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:05.005
No. She...

01:14:32.367 --> 01:14:37.304
The army has her.

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:42.910
Would this have anything to do

01:14:55.324 --> 01:15:00.261
with that toxic spill
that didn't happen?

01:15:08.670 --> 01:15:12.606
Yeah.

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:17.611
And your daughter, you say?

01:15:19.081 --> 01:15:24.018
That gear back there belongs
to a couple of young killers

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:29.623
I had out this morning.

01:15:30.559 --> 01:15:32.356
I promised to ship it to 'em
so they could put it in storage.

01:15:32.427 --> 01:15:35.828
I sure don't think they'll be back.

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:39.026
It'll just sit in the garage
with the exercycle

01:15:39.101 --> 01:15:43.834
and the cross-country skis
and the racquetball rackets.

01:15:43.906 --> 01:15:45.703
Might as well put it
to some use before then.

01:15:45.774 --> 01:15:47.298
It'll get down pretty low tonight,

01:15:47.376 --> 01:15:50.504
but you get in them
sleeping bags right away,

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:55.516
you'll survive.

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:00.118
There's only one farm
out this way.

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:05.125
Nobody's lived there
for 25 years,

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:08.655
so if they're keepin' her
anywhere around here,

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.324
that'll be the place.

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:16.337
Now...

01:16:18.340 --> 01:16:22.003
I take out all kinds of folks...

01:16:22.077 --> 01:16:27.014
hunters, what have you.

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:46.767
There's a lot
of different game up here.

01:16:55.978 --> 01:17:00.915
But if I'm lookin' at grouse,

01:17:09.324 --> 01:17:12.987
then I have to go in
with a whole different set-up

01:17:13.061 --> 01:17:17.794
than if I'm lookin' at deer or elk.

01:17:17.866 --> 01:17:22.803
Now, you don't have to be
in a rush to tell me anything,

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:31.078
but at some point, you're
gonna have to let me know

01:17:31.747 --> 01:17:36.684
just exactly what it is
that I'm gonna be lookin' at.

01:17:42.424 --> 01:17:47.361
Oh...

01:17:48.296 --> 01:17:53.233
just bend these
and give 'em a shake.

01:17:53.635 --> 01:17:58.572
Good night.

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:02.902
Good night.

01:18:02.978 --> 01:18:07.915
I guess we'd better
get in our bags.

01:18:11.787 --> 01:18:16.724
They're not gonna
do anything to her, Lisa.

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:27.668
She's too important to them.

01:18:29.938 --> 01:18:32.532
Just before it gets dark

01:18:32.607 --> 01:18:37.544
Before you grow

01:19:33.201 --> 01:19:38.138
Before you're
too old to pretend

01:19:43.612 --> 01:19:48.549
Just before it gets dark

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:53.686
And you know your dreams
will not come back again

01:19:53.755 --> 01:19:55.017
Hold on

01:19:55.090 --> 01:20:00.027
Hold on tight

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.901
And I promise you, baby

01:20:08.970 --> 01:20:13.907
It'll all be all right

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:15.304
I promise you, baby

01:20:15.377 --> 01:20:18.244
It'll all be all right

01:20:18.313 --> 01:20:19.302
(crying)

01:20:19.381 --> 01:20:24.318
Williams.

01:20:26.588 --> 01:20:27.850
Williams, you asleep?

01:20:27.923 --> 01:20:32.121
Not anymore.

01:20:32.194 --> 01:20:34.788
Keel's got the night watch
on the little girl.

01:20:43.405 --> 01:20:48.342
He's gonna let us in
to take a look. You in?

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:56.083
Yeah.

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:34.855
All right.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.955
Let's go.

01:23:19.027 --> 01:23:23.964
This is really dumb.
This is a court-martial.

01:23:26.134 --> 01:23:31.071
We'll be in and out
in ten minutes.

01:23:36.778 --> 01:23:39.576
- No one's gonna get court-martialed.
- Is that right?

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:43.674
This kid's gonna bring these guys
down from outer space.

01:23:43.752 --> 01:23:46.118
The least we can do
is look her in the eye.

01:23:46.187 --> 01:23:47.484
Hi.

01:23:47.555 --> 01:23:49.682
We were just
kind of wondering...

01:23:49.758 --> 01:23:51.589
What the big deal was.

01:23:51.659 --> 01:23:53.388
Yeah, pretty much.

01:23:53.461 --> 01:23:57.090
I'm not quite sure.

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:58.826
I'm important to the...

01:23:58.900 --> 01:24:01.494
do you guys
call them aliens?

01:24:01.569 --> 01:24:06.029
Yeah, usually.

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:06.664
Okay, the aliens.

01:24:06.741 --> 01:24:08.208
And your general figures
they'll come get me.

01:24:08.276 --> 01:24:09.470
We kind of know that already.

01:24:09.544 --> 01:24:14.481
How come <i>you're</i>
so special to them?

01:24:15.817 --> 01:24:18.047
They're my other family.

01:24:18.119 --> 01:24:19.984
What do you mean?

01:24:20.055 --> 01:24:22.319
I'm part them.

01:24:22.390 --> 01:24:26.986
For real?

01:24:27.062 --> 01:24:29.860
But you just look like a little kid.

01:24:29.931 --> 01:24:30.590
Maybe they're not
as different as you think.

01:24:30.665 --> 01:24:33.600
ALLIE: Can I ask you something?

01:24:33.668 --> 01:24:36.000
Sure.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:40.508
Are you mad at them?

01:24:40.575 --> 01:24:42.338
But you'll fight with them
just the same?

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:48.115
That's our job.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:52.919
Grownups are weird.

01:24:52.987 --> 01:24:54.011
36 hours... nothing from
Cheyenne Mountain,

01:24:54.089 --> 01:24:59.026
nothing from NORAD,
nothing in the sky.

01:25:03.798 --> 01:25:06.665
Damn it!

01:25:06.734 --> 01:25:10.363
I knew this whole thing
was a bust.

01:25:10.438 --> 01:25:13.703
I'm a four-star general.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.403
I've been serving my country
for 30 years,

01:25:16.478 --> 01:25:21.415
now I'm sitting in the middle
of Old McDonaldland

01:25:26.488 --> 01:25:31.084
with a 9-year-old girl?

01:25:31.159 --> 01:25:36.096
I'll tell you one thing...

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:41.124
I'm gonna have that
squirrelly-ass Dr. Wakeman

01:25:41.202 --> 01:25:44.330
served up on a platter for this.

01:25:44.405 --> 01:25:49.342
I'm not gonna be
the only one taking this fall.

01:25:54.082 --> 01:25:59.019
You want to tell me
what the hell went wrong?

01:26:05.426 --> 01:26:10.363
Oh, you got a theory, don't you?

01:26:11.966 --> 01:26:16.903
They're up in their craft
worried about this girl,

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:49.803
and as soon as you take
that thing off her head,

01:26:49.871 --> 01:26:54.808
they're gonna come swooping down.

01:26:55.777 --> 01:26:58.644
Well, we could have
been mistaken.

01:26:58.713 --> 01:27:03.650
Well, that's big of you
to admit it.

01:27:09.257 --> 01:27:11.054
General, we're talking
about aliens here.

01:27:11.125 --> 01:27:15.494
By definition, their motives,
their behavior,

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:20.500
everything about them
would be... alien.

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:26.806
So how much longer
do we wait?

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:34.915
That's entirely up to you.

01:27:36.918 --> 01:27:41.855
What's a five-letter word
for "idiot"?

01:27:42.223 --> 01:27:43.850
This whole culture is built
on a fear of death.

01:27:43.925 --> 01:27:48.862
No one wants to talk about it,

01:27:50.765 --> 01:27:52.892
everyone wants to pretend
it's not gonna happen.

01:27:52.967 --> 01:27:57.904
That's how come you get
those vegetarians

01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:03.877
springing up all over the place.

01:28:04.712 --> 01:28:09.513
"If I don't eat the little darlings,
then they're never gonna die."

01:28:09.584 --> 01:28:12.644
Nonsense.

01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:17.453
Neither one of you has ever
been hunting, am I right?

01:28:17.525 --> 01:28:19.789
I went out with some guys once
when I was maybe 14.

01:28:19.861 --> 01:28:22.193
We were living in Wisconsin.

01:28:22.263 --> 01:28:27.200
I didn't like it.
It made me feel terrible.

01:28:31.673 --> 01:28:34.642
Well, you're supposed
to feel terrible.

01:28:34.709 --> 01:28:37.701
That's a part of it...

01:28:37.779 --> 01:28:41.044
understanding what it costs
for you to stay alive.

01:28:41.115 --> 01:28:46.052
Well, we better keep moving.

01:28:48.323 --> 01:28:53.260
As it is, it'll be dark before
we get to where I think we...

01:28:54.862 --> 01:28:58.958
(rustling)

01:28:59.033 --> 01:29:03.970
That little girl of yours
must be something special.

01:29:04.539 --> 01:29:09.476
- How are you?
- I'm all right, ma'am.

01:29:17.085 --> 01:29:22.022
What you got up there?

01:29:22.490 --> 01:29:27.427
Some sort of toxic spill, ma'am.

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:35.934
Ah, is that what they told you?

01:29:36.003 --> 01:29:40.940
Yes, ma'am.

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:46.413
You'll have to let me through.
I need to see General Beers.

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.946
Do you have clearance?

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:57.957
Do you have any idea
what spilled up there?

01:30:01.362 --> 01:30:06.299
No, ma'am, I don't.

01:30:45.106 --> 01:30:50.043
You need to let me through.

01:31:05.092 --> 01:31:06.491
I have important information
that General Beers is expecting.

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:11.498
You're not gonna
let me through, are you?

01:31:30.785 --> 01:31:33.948
No, ma'am.

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.010
I didn't think so.

01:31:35.089 --> 01:31:36.920
Next time, I'm just gonna
run through the roadblock,

01:31:36.991 --> 01:31:41.928
so why don't you arrest me?

01:31:51.405 --> 01:31:54.863
What?

01:31:54.942 --> 01:31:59.879
Arrest me and have someone
take me to General Beers.

01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:07.010
No one goes in.
We detain people here.

01:32:07.088 --> 01:32:12.025
Okay, well, then detain me

01:32:12.527 --> 01:32:14.825
and get General Beers
on the phone and let him know

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:19.833
that Mary Crawford has important
new information about the project.

01:32:20.835 --> 01:32:23.736
I can't do that
without provocation, ma'am.

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:27.730
(sighs) I see.

01:32:27.808 --> 01:32:32.745
(clears throat)

01:32:41.422 --> 01:32:41.979
How's this?

01:32:42.056 --> 01:32:43.387
They're not coming, are they?

01:32:43.658 --> 01:32:45.785
Maybe they're not
that worried about her,

01:32:45.860 --> 01:32:46.087
maybe they think she can
fight her own battles.

01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:46.649
You don't know
when to quit, do you?

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:51.664
At the roadblock,

01:33:38.646 --> 01:33:42.377
you told one of my soldiers
you had information for me.

01:33:44.151 --> 01:33:49.088
I lied.

01:33:56.230 --> 01:34:00.098
You son of a bitch.

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:04.866
Did you think I was just going
to let you take the project

01:34:04.939 --> 01:34:09.876
away from me,
you and the general here?

01:34:17.618 --> 01:34:22.555
You bastard.

01:35:04.598 --> 01:35:06.759
You sold me out
the first chance you got.

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:11.800
Worthless bastard!

01:35:11.872 --> 01:35:13.567
At the roadblock. Trunk.

01:35:13.641 --> 01:35:15.006
Put her somewhere
where she can't hurt anyone.

01:35:15.076 --> 01:35:17.840
MARY: Creep.

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:22.246
It's a woman thing, right?

01:35:22.316 --> 01:35:27.253
They know how to hold a grudge.

01:35:28.589 --> 01:35:32.889
My father had this idea that
he could do dangerous things

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:35.292
because they needed him,
that they'd keep him safe.

01:35:35.362 --> 01:35:40.299
Well, they took care of me
more than once.

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:18.604
Because they needed us to, uh...

01:36:19.039 --> 01:36:21.599
to get together.

01:36:21.675 --> 01:36:24.109
Because they needed Allie.

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:29.115
Exactly.

01:36:29.650 --> 01:36:30.810
So they're not gonna
let anything happen to her.

01:36:30.885 --> 01:36:32.477
We don't know that.
They're not gods, Charlie.

01:36:32.553 --> 01:36:37.490
No. We're outclassed enough,
so they can act like gods.

01:36:39.193 --> 01:36:43.892
We don't know what they want
with Allie or why they did this.

01:36:43.964 --> 01:36:48.901
The odds are they didn't
go through all this trouble

01:36:49.737 --> 01:36:51.466
just so they could hand her
over to these people.

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:56.476
I think she's gonna be all right.

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:57.566
I'm going to find Allie
and do whatever I can to help her.

01:36:57.645 --> 01:37:02.582
I'm not going to rely on them
for anything.

01:37:12.626 --> 01:37:17.563
Hey!

01:37:18.199 --> 01:37:23.136
Okay.

01:37:27.641 --> 01:37:29.165
I need to speak to Miss Crawford.

01:37:29.243 --> 01:37:33.907
This is for
Miss Crawford's ears only.

01:37:33.981 --> 01:37:38.918
You can wait over there.

01:37:40.788 --> 01:37:42.847
SOLDIER: Yes, sir.

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:45.949
You peeked, didn't you?

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:46.685
My grandfather
found it at Pine Lodge.

01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:47.226
At the crash site.

01:37:47.294 --> 01:37:48.693
I never thought your dad
was all that bright.

01:37:48.762 --> 01:37:51.162
It can be very effective
when a stupid person lies to you.

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:53.826
I found some papers
with these images on them

01:37:53.901 --> 01:37:58.838
when we moved out
of Groom Lake.

01:38:00.207 --> 01:38:05.144
I asked your dad about them,

01:38:08.315 --> 01:38:13.252
he gave me nothing.

01:38:13.621 --> 01:38:15.680
I stood there with your father
and told him I was wrong

01:38:15.756 --> 01:38:18.919
about the body
from the Roswell wreckage

01:38:18.993 --> 01:38:23.327
being the transmitter.

01:38:23.397 --> 01:38:24.591
I told him there had
to be something else.

01:38:24.665 --> 01:38:25.324
He just looked at me
like he didn't have a clue.

01:38:25.399 --> 01:38:26.559
(chuckling)
You got to admire that.

01:38:26.634 --> 01:38:30.593
Mary...

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.502
I had to go with them.

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:34.006
I couldn't let all this
happen without me.

01:38:34.074 --> 01:38:39.011
You understand?

01:38:42.883 --> 01:38:47.820
Please. I would have done
exactly the same thing.

01:38:54.728 --> 01:38:57.458
I know.
