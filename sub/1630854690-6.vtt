WEBVTT

00:01.227 --> 00:02.909
- Are we sure
this is the right way?

00:03.062 --> 00:04.895
- Yeah, I'm sure, babe,
it's just up ahead.

00:04.897 --> 00:05.912
- You said that two miles ago.

00:05.989 --> 00:07.581
- Yeah, but this time I mean it.

00:07.657 --> 00:11.235
I just want to be
in our favorite place
with my favorite person.

00:11.237 --> 00:13.012
Is that too much to ask?

00:13.163 --> 00:14.921
- No, it's not too much to ask.

00:15.074 --> 00:18.392
(water babbling)

00:19.428 --> 00:21.520
Whoa.

00:25.175 --> 00:26.433
- How about this?

00:27.102 --> 00:30.921
(gasps)
Amy Madani, I love you.

00:30.923 --> 00:32.180
I know we don't have much,

00:32.199 --> 00:36.017
but you're the only thing
I need. Marry me?

00:36.095 --> 00:39.096
- Where did you get that--
- I asked you first.

00:39.114 --> 00:41.707
- Oh, my God, uh. Yes!

00:41.784 --> 00:44.084
(chuckling)
Yeah!

00:46.789 --> 00:49.590
(laughing)

00:53.703 --> 00:54.945
(loud boom)

00:54.963 --> 00:57.473
- Okay, what was that?

01:02.471 --> 01:06.290
- Uh... Tim, am I dreaming
right now?

01:06.308 --> 01:09.142
(laughing)
- I hope not.

01:09.295 --> 01:11.886
Weddings aren't cheap.
(laughing)

01:11.906 --> 01:13.739
Look out!
- Ahh!

01:14.967 --> 01:16.800
(breathing heavily)

01:16.802 --> 01:18.660
(mysterious music)

01:31.333 --> 01:33.241
<i> - Thank you for agreeing</i>
<i> to see Keith</i>

01:33.260 --> 01:35.319
<i> on such short notice,</i>
<i> Dr. Friedman.</i>

01:35.321 --> 01:36.503
<i> We didn't know</i>
<i> what else to do.</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:37.912
- He was doing great,

01:38.081 --> 01:40.265
and then he just kind of shut
down all of a sudden.

01:40.342 --> 01:42.417
- Well, recovery isn't linear.

01:42.469 --> 01:44.603
It can take time
for trauma survivors

01:44.680 --> 01:46.163
to feel safe enough to open up.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.181
- It started when
we tested his DNA.

01:48.258 --> 01:51.001
- That must be the royal
"we" because we, I,

01:51.019 --> 01:53.094
thought that testing
his DNA was a bad idea.

01:53.114 --> 01:55.856
I'm just offering context,
I'm just offering context.

01:55.932 --> 01:57.950
- I did it
for our daughter, Sidney,

01:58.101 --> 01:59.601
she's just having a hard time

01:59.620 --> 02:01.027
accepting that Keith
is really back.

02:01.104 --> 02:05.182
- And how's it been for the two
of you with him home?

02:05.184 --> 02:10.278
- It's been good.
Hard... Strange...

02:10.356 --> 02:16.117
Um, when he was taken,
we were still married.

02:16.195 --> 02:18.545
- Now we're divorced,
but we work together.

02:18.697 --> 02:22.975
And she's currently
engaged to the detective
who worked Keith's case.

02:23.126 --> 02:27.587
- And his girlfriend
just left him for lying
about being infertile.

02:28.390 --> 02:29.556
You're the one
that wanted context.

02:29.708 --> 02:32.151
- I should say that we also
do treat adults.

02:32.378 --> 02:36.638
- Jay doesn't believe
in therapy. He prefers
to suffer in silence.

02:36.715 --> 02:38.973
- Do you think
you can help Keith?

02:39.067 --> 02:44.721
- I do. Right now,
your situation feels
uniquely overwhelming.

02:44.723 --> 02:46.481
- Yeah.
- But I do this work every day,

02:46.500 --> 02:48.742
and the kids
I'll introduce Keith to,

02:48.894 --> 02:51.837
they've all been in his shoes.
Healing is possible.

02:52.064 --> 02:54.247
- Great.
- For all of you.

02:54.324 --> 02:56.425
(phone alarm sounding)

02:59.738 --> 03:01.922
- I'm afraid that we have to go.

03:01.998 --> 03:04.391
(alarm ringing)

03:14.678 --> 03:16.937
- A Tim Wilkes and Amy Madani.

03:17.089 --> 03:20.515
- For two days, you haven't
heard anything from Tim or Amy?

03:20.534 --> 03:23.035
- No, no, and my calls go
to voicemail.

03:23.186 --> 03:26.947
I thought maybe that they just
extended their trip.

03:27.766 --> 03:32.360
I should've called you sooner.
- It's okay, we're here now.

03:32.362 --> 03:34.362
Okay, my team,
they're the best around.

03:34.381 --> 03:38.108
We'll find them,
I promise. Thank you.

03:38.126 --> 03:41.428
- Okay, well, thank you.
- No, thank you.

03:43.632 --> 03:46.040
- Alright nothing from either
one of their parents.

03:46.060 --> 03:49.803
Same as work, no PTO, no sick
days, they just didn't show up.

03:49.955 --> 03:52.122
I ran their credit card
statements.

03:52.124 --> 03:53.457
- You pulled a warrant
that fast?

03:53.517 --> 03:55.400
- Yeah...
- Right, sorry, dumb question.

03:55.552 --> 03:58.720
- Anyway, nothing but a tank
of gas on Friday night.

03:58.797 --> 04:00.130
- Oh, that makes sense,
'cause the neighbor said

04:00.148 --> 04:02.799
that they had gone on some kind
of romantic getaway.

04:02.801 --> 04:05.410
- Alright, so if they're in
trouble, we're two days behind.

04:05.562 --> 04:09.081
- Look at this, past due,
final notice.

04:09.232 --> 04:11.324
All their mail is overdue bills,

04:11.477 --> 04:13.994
and then a couple
of pawn show coupons.

04:14.146 --> 04:15.979
"We buy records,
collectibles..."

04:16.982 --> 04:21.677
- Looks like they sold theirs.
Sun bleach patters, the racks...

04:23.322 --> 04:25.097
I had a vinyl collection,
remember mine?

04:25.248 --> 04:27.266
All punk all the time.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.842
- What I remember
is that at that time,

04:28.918 --> 04:30.176
we couldn't pay
our bills either.

04:30.329 --> 04:32.754
- So, you think they ran?
- Well, I'm looking

04:32.831 --> 04:35.399
at several thousand reasons
why they'd want to.

04:44.860 --> 04:47.119
(phone ringing)

04:49.105 --> 04:52.032
Hey, baby, what's up?
- The impound lot has their car.

04:52.184 --> 04:54.518
Tow truck driver picked it up
off of Route 414.

04:54.536 --> 04:57.020
Looks like they ditched it.
- Text us the address,

04:57.022 --> 04:58.279
we'll meet you and Kemi there.

04:58.299 --> 04:59.856
<i> - No, it's just me.</i>
<i> Kemi's got another case.</i>

04:59.875 --> 05:01.858
- What case?
- Unsolved kidnapping in '05.

05:01.860 --> 05:04.619
Looks like she finally
got a break. I can pull her
if you want me to.

05:04.696 --> 05:06.696
<i> - Nah, let her do her thing.</i>
- Okay.

05:06.715 --> 05:09.791
- I have told you I have done
nothing wrong!

05:09.868 --> 05:12.460
- Other than abduct a child.
- That is ridiculous!

05:12.479 --> 05:15.480
I want a lawyer.
- Well, if wishes were horses,

05:15.632 --> 05:17.131
then beggars would ride.

05:17.151 --> 05:19.059
- This is not a wish,
it is a right.

05:19.211 --> 05:20.727
And I am exercising mine.

05:20.879 --> 05:23.822
- You want to know what I do
for exercise? This.

05:23.899 --> 05:25.048
(door slams)

05:25.141 --> 05:26.992
(breathing heavily)

05:28.236 --> 05:29.644
- Came in this morning.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.721
Guess it'd been sitting there
a couple days.

05:31.723 --> 05:33.239
- The tags are current.

05:33.392 --> 05:37.169
Doesn't look like it got into
a car accident. Why bring it in?

05:37.245 --> 05:39.396
- Says here it didn't have
a permit.

05:39.414 --> 05:42.657
- A permit for what?
- It doesn't say.

05:43.752 --> 05:45.844
- So I just spoke to the guy
at the pawn shop.

05:45.921 --> 05:49.181
Tim was not trying to get cash
for his record collection.

05:49.332 --> 05:52.142
He traded it in for
an engagement ring.

05:54.096 --> 05:55.687
- In my trunk.
- What?

05:55.764 --> 05:58.598
- At the bottom of my gym bag,
hidden in a pair of dirty socks.

05:58.600 --> 06:00.934
- What are you talking about?
- Your engagement ring.

06:01.086 --> 06:04.178
That's where it is.
It's dark, lonely,

06:04.198 --> 06:06.423
looking for a finger
to keep it company.

06:06.441 --> 06:09.426
- We, uh, we talked
to Dr. Friedman today.

06:09.428 --> 06:11.519
- About Keith.
I'm talking about us.

06:11.597 --> 06:13.613
- We had our window to tell
the kids and we didn't.

06:13.765 --> 06:16.208
Now Keith is struggling
in therapy.

06:16.284 --> 06:18.451
It just doesn't feel
like the right time.

06:18.528 --> 06:20.286
- You.re gonna tell them
that their mom is marrying

06:20.363 --> 06:21.696
somebody other than their dad.

06:21.790 --> 06:23.289
I don't think there's gonna be
a right time.

06:23.366 --> 06:26.259
- I think I know
what the permit was for.

06:28.463 --> 06:30.630
Did I miss something?
- Nothing.

06:30.707 --> 06:33.558
Tell us about the permit.
- I once knew this smuggler

06:33.710 --> 06:35.952
in Kabul, trying to take
classified documents

06:35.954 --> 06:37.470
over the border into Iran.

06:37.547 --> 06:39.456
When he got there,
the guard said,

06:39.474 --> 06:41.382
"Hey, what do you
got to declare?"

06:41.443 --> 06:44.461
He said, "Nothing, nothing."
Guard takes out a gun, bang,

06:44.479 --> 06:47.572
shoots him right in the face.
He knew he was lying.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.390
- Point of that story?

06:49.468 --> 06:51.468
- I just told you the point
to that story.

06:51.486 --> 06:53.319
- Hold on...
- The tow truck company said

06:53.396 --> 06:55.414
they picked this car up
at mile marker 42.

06:55.490 --> 06:57.657
That's overflow parking
for the national forest.

06:57.809 --> 07:00.585
- Parking that requires a permit
that they didn't have.

07:00.662 --> 07:03.146
- No cell reception,
no credit card charges,

07:03.165 --> 07:05.907
they were camping and this
snowstorm is headed their way.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.001
- Mike, call the rangers,
I'll call PFD.

07:08.153 --> 07:12.155
Our missing persons case
just became a search
and rescue mission.

07:12.174 --> 07:13.990
- That's another ten,

07:13.992 --> 07:19.137
which brings the total
to 865... thousand.

07:19.364 --> 07:21.331
That's not even half
of what we took.

07:21.349 --> 07:23.775
(laughing)
- Did we take it or steal it?

07:23.927 --> 07:25.593
We wanted and no one
came for it,

07:25.671 --> 07:28.763
but I still feel guilty...
and turned on.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.857
(chuckling)
And terrified.

07:31.009 --> 07:35.454
If this is 800,000, there must
have been 80 million back there.

07:36.198 --> 07:37.847
Who has that kind of cash?

07:37.866 --> 07:39.516
- The part about you
being turned on,

07:39.518 --> 07:41.460
I stopped
listening after that.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.630
- You do know
a storm's coming in.

07:45.707 --> 07:46.465
- Mm-hmm.

07:46.692 --> 07:48.282
- And we should probably
go back.

07:48.302 --> 07:50.860
- Mm-hmm.
- Or into the tent.

07:50.862 --> 07:51.711
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.364 --> 07:53.972
- You got something
that belongs to me!

07:54.199 --> 07:55.456
- Oh.
(nervous chuckling)

07:55.534 --> 07:58.626
Mister, you, um...
You scared the crap out of us.

07:58.628 --> 08:01.054
- Oh, I could do more than that.
(Amy screams)

08:01.206 --> 08:02.555
- Stop!
- You saw the pallets.

08:02.632 --> 08:05.225
- If it's the money you want,
here, take it. Take it!

08:05.301 --> 08:06.651
- That's unfortunate.
- No!

08:06.728 --> 08:08.636
(gunshot)
(Amy screams)

08:09.231 --> 08:13.316
- We gotta go.
Tim, we gotta go, now.

08:14.386 --> 08:16.569
- Who was that guy?
- I have no idea,

08:16.722 --> 08:18.747
but we have to get off
this mountain.

08:22.318 --> 08:24.127
- Let's get our money.

08:30.252 --> 08:31.826
<i> - You work</i>
<i> for search and rescue.</i>

08:31.845 --> 08:33.586
<i> There are two people missing.</i>

08:33.739 --> 08:36.848
- We'll look for them in 12
hours, after the storm passes.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.183
- By that time,
it may be too late.

08:38.334 --> 08:39.409
- We have two hours at most

08:39.411 --> 08:40.519
before this storm
reaches the park,

08:40.670 --> 08:43.079
and before that, high winds,
low visibility...

08:43.098 --> 08:45.357
I can't send my team in there,
it's not safe.

08:45.508 --> 08:47.250
- Then don't send
your team, send us.

08:47.269 --> 08:48.860
Choppers us up, and take off.

08:48.937 --> 08:51.421
- Where? The park
is 70,000 acres.

08:51.423 --> 08:54.924
- I think I can narrow that down
by 100 fold or more.

08:55.460 --> 08:58.703
These photos were at Tim
and Amy's apartment.

08:58.855 --> 09:02.766
Different seasons, but almost
always in the same area.

09:02.784 --> 09:06.211
- That makes sense,
they chose their favorite spot
for the engagement.

09:06.362 --> 09:09.773
- Yeah. Fisher's Point,
Clark's Nob, Bald Nob.

09:09.791 --> 09:12.125
Three points, three angles.
Dust it off with a little bit

09:12.277 --> 09:15.369
of trig, that is a ten-acre
sweet spot

09:15.389 --> 09:17.889
in and around the summit
of Big Mountain.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.057
- Okay, okay, Big Mountain.

09:19.134 --> 09:20.967
Can you assign a pilot
to take us there?

09:21.119 --> 09:24.145
- I told you. No, I can't put
my team at risk.

09:26.308 --> 09:28.233
But I can take you there myself.

09:28.384 --> 09:31.144
- Great.
- God help me.

09:31.721 --> 09:34.722
- Before we begin,
I'd like to introduce the group

09:34.800 --> 09:37.576
to a new member, Keith Grant.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.730
The first day can be
a little daunting,

09:42.749 --> 09:45.975
but just remember that this is
a safe space, Keith.

09:45.994 --> 09:50.005
Everyone here is a survivor,
just like you.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.333
A survivor, not a victim.

09:53.485 --> 09:55.485
See, that's what we do here.

09:55.503 --> 10:00.247
We reclaim our trauma
so we can reframe our stories.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.601
- I'm just here for the cookies.
(chuckling)

10:02.752 --> 10:04.936
- So, let's start
with something sweet.

10:05.163 --> 10:08.523
Being home. How does that feel?

10:10.927 --> 10:12.527
- Guilty.

10:16.024 --> 10:18.033
That's how I felt.

10:19.435 --> 10:20.768
Ashamed.

10:21.788 --> 10:26.349
Scared that people wouldn't
like me if they knew the truth,

10:26.368 --> 10:29.127
or they'd... they'd blame me.

10:30.872 --> 10:32.464
I'd blame me.

10:34.801 --> 10:37.469
So I, uh, I tried to forget.

10:39.806 --> 10:43.475
And... you can, you know.

10:44.202 --> 10:45.793
Forget some things.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.054
- But other things
stay with you.

10:48.206 --> 10:50.482
- The way the room smelled.

10:52.544 --> 10:54.986
Her. Some of her.

10:55.596 --> 11:00.325
Everything about her except the
stuff the cops actually need.

11:00.476 --> 11:03.144
I'm to blame for getting caught.

11:03.163 --> 11:06.164
I'm to blame for
not catching her.

11:06.241 --> 11:08.541
She's still out there.

11:12.898 --> 11:15.548
How can I forgive myself
for that?

11:17.068 --> 11:19.719
- We have to, don't we?

11:24.500 --> 11:26.743
- You got flares, first aid,
and a sat phone.

11:26.761 --> 11:29.078
Doesn't make up for not having
common sense,

11:29.097 --> 11:30.171
but it's the best I got for you.

11:30.248 --> 11:31.597
- No, you've done plenty,
thank you.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.751
- That's the ridge line from
the photo that Kemi showed us.

11:34.769 --> 11:36.586
We're going this way, east.

11:36.588 --> 11:38.421
- Okay, I'll give you
30 minutes.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.699
After that,
you're on your own.

11:44.596 --> 11:47.280
- You did the right thing.
- Putting them in harm's way?

11:47.432 --> 11:49.207
- They know what they're doing,

11:49.358 --> 11:52.043
so you staring at your phone
is not gonna help them do it.

11:52.195 --> 11:54.528
- Right.
- But here's a smile,

11:54.606 --> 11:58.291
I just got an invitation
to my dad's 60th.

11:58.367 --> 12:00.552
It's gonna be a black tie,
open bar,

12:00.703 --> 12:02.462
a little bit of back-stabbing.

12:02.614 --> 12:04.948
- Sounds more like an olive
branch than an invitation.

12:04.966 --> 12:07.058
You should go.
- You know, this case

12:07.135 --> 12:11.637
I'm working on
is kind of my white whale,
the one that got away.

12:11.790 --> 12:13.714
- Right.
- I need to solve it

12:13.808 --> 12:18.644
before he and I, uh, can air
kiss and pretend to make up.

12:18.797 --> 12:20.146
(chuckling)
- Why?

12:20.223 --> 12:21.597
What's he got to do with it?

12:21.633 --> 12:23.074
(door opening)

12:26.304 --> 12:28.395
- Do you know who I am?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.206
(laughing)

12:32.586 --> 12:34.753
- You know, that's funny.

12:36.998 --> 12:39.499
I was about to ask you
the same thing.

12:39.651 --> 12:44.078
- I am... untouchable.

12:44.747 --> 12:46.473
- You don't remember, do you?

12:48.101 --> 12:51.603
18 years ago, in Zamfara,

12:51.830 --> 12:57.333
a man broke into the home
of a wealthy couple,

12:57.335 --> 13:00.612
and took their 15-year-old girl.

13:02.115 --> 13:07.010
And for three days
and three nights,

13:07.028 --> 13:10.013
he held her captive,

13:10.031 --> 13:13.607
until the police raided
the man's compound

13:13.685 --> 13:15.960
and saved the girl.

13:16.037 --> 13:20.632
Now, the girl's father told her
that the man died in that raid.

13:21.951 --> 13:23.760
But decades later...

13:25.030 --> 13:26.471
here you are.

13:27.474 --> 13:34.295
- That is a terrible...
terrible story.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.480
(scoffs)

13:36.057 --> 13:39.800
But I had nothing to do with it.
- Scar on your left shoulder.

13:40.228 --> 13:43.029
Burn mark on your chest.

13:44.232 --> 13:46.074
I know who you are.

13:47.327 --> 13:51.054
And by now, I'm pretty sure
you know who I am too.

13:51.056 --> 13:53.998
After you did that to me,

13:54.150 --> 13:57.076
I didn't speak for a year.

13:57.228 --> 13:59.671
The doctors couldn't help me.

14:00.582 --> 14:03.900
Until my nana took me
to a shaman.

14:03.902 --> 14:08.421
And the minute
the shaman saw me,

14:08.573 --> 14:12.909
she shrieked...

14:12.927 --> 14:17.747
because she knew I had powers.

14:18.358 --> 14:23.570
A connection to the spirit world
in which, I assure you...

14:25.106 --> 14:29.701
...you are very touchable.

14:31.096 --> 14:34.080
(tense music)

14:41.697 --> 14:44.457
- We've been walking
for an hour. I need to rest.

14:44.609 --> 14:46.459
(groaning)

14:46.535 --> 14:48.595
My stomach.

14:49.948 --> 14:51.464
From that punch.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.799
Something happened.

14:53.894 --> 14:56.144
(groaning)

14:59.733 --> 15:03.067
- It's all right. Are you okay?

15:03.069 --> 15:06.446
- It kills. My shoulder too.

15:09.225 --> 15:11.859
- Do you recognize any of this?
- No.

15:12.971 --> 15:16.664
I'm sorry. I know
we have to keep going.

15:17.976 --> 15:20.660
- I'm the one
who should be sorry.

15:20.812 --> 15:23.146
I was so scared, I just ran.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.090
But I think I may have
gotten us lost.

15:26.651 --> 15:27.741
I'm sorry.

15:27.928 --> 15:32.764
- You ever been in therapy?
- I was, am, will be.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.416
Although, he's probably going
to want to charge double

15:35.435 --> 15:38.327
if I keep working with you.
- Anyway, I went to a shrink

15:38.346 --> 15:40.513
with Nik today to talk
about Keith.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.349
- Yeah, she told me.
- In under two minutes,

15:43.426 --> 15:45.777
this guy, he started
talking about us,

15:45.928 --> 15:48.337
how we disagree
about Keith's DNA test,

15:48.356 --> 15:50.949
how we disagree about Keith
seeing a therapist...

15:51.025 --> 15:52.525
- Those decisions
aren't easy to make.

15:52.601 --> 15:55.394
- I know, but the thing is,
it took him two minutes

15:55.472 --> 15:58.181
to realize that I drive her
completely nuts.

15:58.199 --> 16:01.350
You know, like I'm a scab
on her body

16:01.352 --> 16:02.852
that she can't stop picking at.

16:02.870 --> 16:04.611
That's me,
the human scab, right?

16:05.281 --> 16:07.465
That's me. You can disagree
with me, that's the point.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.041
- Hey, look.

16:09.194 --> 16:11.010
Is that Tim?

16:12.213 --> 16:14.138
- Who the hell is that?

16:15.308 --> 16:18.518
- Clear. I'm gonna check
the perimeter.

16:23.466 --> 16:26.192
(tense music)

16:28.546 --> 16:32.699
Tim, Amy, it's Philly PD!
We're here to help.

16:50.752 --> 16:51.676
What do you got?

16:52.028 --> 16:55.755
- .308 cal. My guess,
it's from a Mauser.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.908
- What, a sniper rifle?
- We used these in the war

16:58.910 --> 17:00.667
to snipe targets from,
like, Bermuda.

17:00.745 --> 17:02.428
I don't know who the hell
would be using it out here.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.430
Certainly not Tim and Amy.
- Well, I found two sets

17:04.582 --> 17:07.266
of prints headed north.
Looks like they were running.

17:07.418 --> 17:10.844
- Alright. Let's get Lisa,
chopper him back.

17:10.864 --> 17:14.757
Maybe get an ID,
somehow figure out how Tim
and Amy are involved.

17:14.759 --> 17:17.017
- I agree, but once she's gone,

17:17.037 --> 17:19.579
we're on our own
with whoever did this.

17:25.436 --> 17:27.620
- We're short. It's not here.

17:27.696 --> 17:30.623
Could be anywhere.
What do you want to do?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.867
- Looks like we're going
hunting.

17:33.945 --> 17:35.553
(laughing)

17:46.307 --> 17:48.808
- I'm sure we've been
reported missing.

17:48.960 --> 17:51.885
So we're gonna light a fire,
get warm,

17:51.905 --> 17:54.238
and wait for someone
to come find us.

17:56.301 --> 17:58.134
Talk about burning
through money.

17:58.136 --> 17:59.893
(chuckling)

17:59.913 --> 18:01.746
Come on, get closer.

18:05.476 --> 18:08.044
Tim, babe,
you need to stay warm.

18:10.998 --> 18:12.090
Timmy.

18:12.241 --> 18:16.094
(crying)
Tim! Tim.

18:19.248 --> 18:24.602
- Thank you... for saying yes.

18:27.089 --> 18:32.593
- Of course, yes. Yes, yes.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.695
A thousand times yes.

18:36.174 --> 18:42.678
Tim... Help, help. Help! Help!

18:42.697 --> 18:44.455
Somebody please help us!

18:44.607 --> 18:47.441
- The body you found on the
mountain, we ran his prints.

18:47.518 --> 18:49.852
His name is Allen Foley,
he's a freighter pilot.

18:49.854 --> 18:53.022
Two days ago, he captained
a flight that was flagged

18:53.024 --> 18:54.540
for inspection upon arrival,

18:54.692 --> 18:56.783
<i> but when he landed,</i>
<i> there was no cargo.</i>

18:56.803 --> 18:58.285
- None? Nothing at all?

18:58.363 --> 19:00.863
- Well, my guess, someone tipped
him off and he dumped it.

19:00.865 --> 19:04.642
- I reached out to the FAA
to see the flight path
between Toronto and here.

19:04.793 --> 19:08.037
Granted, talking to people is
not usually in my wheelhouse,

19:08.039 --> 19:10.982
but interacting with the living
was surprisingly refreshing.

19:11.133 --> 19:12.558
- Okay, and?!

19:12.710 --> 19:15.211
<i> - And the flight path</i>
<i> from there to here</i>

19:15.229 --> 19:17.321
goes directly over
Buchanan State Forest.

19:17.398 --> 19:20.232
- It looks like he ditched
the cargo, landed,

19:20.309 --> 19:21.492
and then circled back to get it.

19:21.644 --> 19:23.903
- So wait, who found him
before he could?

19:24.055 --> 19:25.888
- Well, when we have that,
we will call.

19:25.907 --> 19:27.498
Until then,
please just be careful.

19:27.691 --> 19:30.242
- Yeah. Hey, Nik,
we'll get back to you. Thanks.

19:30.395 --> 19:32.986
- Hey! That could be Tim and Amy
right there.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.247
- Yeah, well, we gotta hurry,
'cause that fire,

19:35.400 --> 19:38.551
if we can see it,
Foley's killer can too.

19:42.665 --> 19:44.273
- Our friend from the lake?

19:44.275 --> 19:45.908
- Our boy friend. Male.

19:45.910 --> 19:49.762
Caucasian. Between 10 and 14.
Here, check this out.

19:49.838 --> 19:54.600
It's a... It's a work
in progress, but with any luck,

19:54.752 --> 19:56.861
I should be able to connect him
to a missing John Doe

19:57.012 --> 19:58.754
in a week or two.

19:58.773 --> 20:02.366
- Good. He deserves to be
reunited with his parents.

20:03.018 --> 20:07.263
Hey, by the way,
Rachel's on her way over.

20:07.281 --> 20:08.781
- Wait, wait, uh...

20:08.933 --> 20:12.435
(stammering)
Wh... Why? What for?

20:12.437 --> 20:14.528
- I told the ME about Foley,

20:14.605 --> 20:16.214
and he's sending her
to pick him up.

20:16.290 --> 20:18.216
You know she won't bite, right?

20:18.367 --> 20:21.177
- Nobody said anything
about biting.

20:21.779 --> 20:23.179
- Hey.

20:24.465 --> 20:27.040
I just got a call from
the State Department.

20:27.543 --> 20:30.786
- Is there
an ambassador missing?

20:30.788 --> 20:32.879
- No, but a diplomat is.

20:32.899 --> 20:35.549
Isaiah Donzomo.
I don't know who he is

20:35.568 --> 20:38.885
or what he means to you,
Kemi, but uh...

20:38.905 --> 20:40.738
- Um, uh...

20:43.301 --> 20:45.634
He...
(clears throat)

20:45.970 --> 20:49.305
- What?
- He abducted me when I was 15.

20:49.307 --> 20:53.084
And, uh... demanded
a ransom payment

20:53.235 --> 20:56.671
that my father
refused... to pay.

20:58.574 --> 21:00.049
- Oh, that's...

21:01.076 --> 21:03.094
(Kemi breathes deeply)

21:03.096 --> 21:05.838
I'm sorry, Kemi, that's awful.

21:05.914 --> 21:07.506
- I, uh...

21:08.509 --> 21:11.010
My father told me
that he was dead,

21:11.086 --> 21:15.498
and last week
at the train station,

21:15.516 --> 21:18.851
the reason that I was distracted
is because I saw him.

21:19.003 --> 21:20.611
(sighing)

21:21.856 --> 21:27.026
He has to pay...
for what he did to me.

21:27.102 --> 21:28.677
- Hey, I agree, I agree.

21:28.679 --> 21:32.290
And I wish that I had the power
to do that, but...

21:32.366 --> 21:36.276
whoever he was,
he is now a Nigerian minister

21:36.354 --> 21:38.370
of trade and development
out of the consulate.

21:38.523 --> 21:41.299
(scoffs)
He has diplomatic immunity,

21:41.375 --> 21:44.260
Kemi, you have to let him go.

21:44.971 --> 21:48.047
- No. No. No...

21:48.123 --> 21:50.549
No, no, I can't do that.

21:50.626 --> 21:53.218
I can't... You can't ask me
to do that.

21:53.295 --> 21:54.870
Please don't ask me
to do that.

21:54.872 --> 21:56.038
(crying)

21:56.223 --> 22:00.726
- Hey. We will figure something
out, but not today.

22:00.803 --> 22:02.394
Today, you have to let him go.

22:02.547 --> 22:06.157
And once he's gone,
I need you to set it aside...

22:06.308 --> 22:08.826
and dig into Alan Foley.

22:08.977 --> 22:10.644
There's a killer
out on that mountain,

22:10.721 --> 22:14.390
and we need to find out
who he is. Okay?

22:14.408 --> 22:15.741
- Okay.

22:15.893 --> 22:17.293
(sniffling)

22:18.504 --> 22:20.296
Okay.
- Okay.

22:21.065 --> 22:22.506
- Thank you.

22:22.583 --> 22:24.967
(tense music)

22:27.329 --> 22:28.596
(sighing)

22:41.694 --> 22:45.696
<i> - Like I said... untouchable.</i>

22:55.524 --> 22:57.166
(inhaling sharply)

23:05.793 --> 23:07.093
- Hey.

23:08.036 --> 23:09.369
You need a ride?

23:09.463 --> 23:11.389
- You really gonna ask
the kidnapped kid

23:11.498 --> 23:13.132
if he wants to get
in a stranger's car?

23:13.208 --> 23:15.451
- What's the worst
that could happen?

23:15.544 --> 23:16.635
(music playing)

23:16.787 --> 23:17.895
- I do not believe you.

23:18.046 --> 23:20.639
- I'm so serious. In F9.

23:20.716 --> 23:23.959
Ludacris and Tyrese
get in a car and go to space.

23:23.961 --> 23:25.310
- What?
- Yeah.

23:25.463 --> 23:27.646
- I thought Tokyo Drift
was bad.

23:27.723 --> 23:29.314
- It was, yeah.

23:29.391 --> 23:31.300
- I guess I'm lucky
I missed it.

23:31.302 --> 23:32.410
(chuckling)

23:32.486 --> 23:34.578
One of the few perks
of living in a basement.

23:35.973 --> 23:37.248
- Alright. Good.

23:37.399 --> 23:40.292
- The basement
was anything but good.

23:41.829 --> 23:45.256
- Talking about it is.
Opening up.

23:45.407 --> 23:48.500
- Why does everyone
want to hear my sob story?

23:49.244 --> 23:51.487
Don't you all have your own
crap to deal with?

23:51.505 --> 23:55.766
- It's not about us.
It just actually helps.

23:55.918 --> 23:58.269
Dealing with the past
is the only way

23:58.420 --> 24:00.938
to get back to normal.
- Normal?

24:01.682 --> 24:04.275
Man, I don't even know
what normal looks like.

24:04.426 --> 24:06.593
Everyone keeps asking me
about what happened,

24:06.612 --> 24:08.595
but all I can think about
is how much I missed.

24:08.614 --> 24:13.192
I'm the only kid in high school
who doesn't have social media

24:13.344 --> 24:15.344
or love Lizzo.

24:15.362 --> 24:17.663
I can't even drive
a freakin' car.

24:18.774 --> 24:20.349
I'm so far from normal,

24:20.367 --> 24:22.960
I wouldn't even know
where to start.

24:25.356 --> 24:30.259
- Alright. New plan.
- What are you doing?

24:31.362 --> 24:34.046
- Your turn. If you want it.

24:34.198 --> 24:35.806
- What's the worst
that could happen?

24:35.883 --> 24:38.534
- Yeah! Alright. Alright.
(laughing)

24:38.552 --> 24:41.061
(car beeping)
That's what I want to hear.

24:45.485 --> 24:48.027
- Tim! Amy!

24:49.063 --> 24:51.563
Hey. Philadelphia PD,

24:51.716 --> 24:55.701
we're gonna get you out of here.
Tell me what happened.

24:58.723 --> 25:00.222
(shouting in the distance)

25:00.224 --> 25:02.491
Tim's gone. Amy, I'm so sorry.

25:03.244 --> 25:05.318
- Okay, we can't stay here.

25:05.396 --> 25:07.505
And to keep in front
of whoever that is,

25:07.656 --> 25:08.839
we can't take him with us.

25:08.916 --> 25:10.508
(shouting in the distance)

25:10.584 --> 25:13.402
- You're in shock
and talking about is not
gonna bring him back.

25:13.420 --> 25:15.237
But if you tell me
what happened,

25:15.239 --> 25:16.405
maybe we can understand
what we're up against.

25:16.423 --> 25:17.515
You gotta talk to me.

25:17.591 --> 25:21.243
- Hey. Any chance
the cavalry's coming?

25:21.262 --> 25:24.504
- I wish. Are you guys okay?

25:25.266 --> 25:27.858
- Uh... For the moment.
What do you know?

25:28.010 --> 25:29.360
<i> - I spoke with Foley's wife,</i>

25:29.529 --> 25:32.921
and she said that he came back
from his last trip in a panic,

25:33.015 --> 25:34.923
and then headed out
at first light.

25:34.942 --> 25:36.592
- Yeah, because he dropped
his contraband

25:36.594 --> 25:39.111
and needed to get it back
before his bosses noticed.

25:39.263 --> 25:40.763
- And the wife told me this,

25:40.931 --> 25:43.874
despite the fact
that another cop had
already visited the house.

25:44.026 --> 25:45.934
- Wait, what other cop?
<i> - Exactly.</i>

25:45.953 --> 25:50.122
She didn't get a name, but
the doorbell cam caught a photo.

25:50.274 --> 25:52.216
- The man on
the mountain with you,

25:52.443 --> 25:54.218
his name is Bill Winchester.

25:54.369 --> 25:56.612
He is the cleaner
for the 215,

25:56.614 --> 26:00.282
<i> that is the gang responsible</i>
<i> for 40% of the meth</i>

26:00.301 --> 26:01.708
<i> in the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

26:01.727 --> 26:04.787
This guy has done time
for arson, armed robbery,

26:04.789 --> 26:06.638
attempted murder, you name it.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.307
-(distant engine revving)

26:08.383 --> 26:09.474
<i> Mike, are you listening to me?</i>

26:09.627 --> 26:12.811
- Jay! Jay!
<i> - Mike, what's going on?</i>

26:12.963 --> 26:14.554
- They're here!

26:15.132 --> 26:17.241
- I can't see them, can you?

26:18.060 --> 26:20.286
- Mike, talk to me, Mike!

26:22.656 --> 26:25.324
(gunshot)
(groaning)

26:25.476 --> 26:26.959
Mike!

26:29.997 --> 26:32.256
(gunshots)
<i> Mike!</i>

26:32.333 --> 26:34.908
Mike! Talk to me, Mike!

26:34.927 --> 26:37.094
(gunshots)
Mike!

26:38.505 --> 26:40.823
Ping their phones and get me
Lisa, I'm going up there.

26:40.841 --> 26:43.342
- You mean, we are.
- I shouldn't have let them go,

26:43.494 --> 26:45.510
and I am not making
that mistake again.

26:45.663 --> 26:47.754
I need you here,
because whatever we just heard,

26:47.832 --> 26:49.422
I need you to pray...

26:49.442 --> 26:51.758
that it's not what
we think it is.

26:51.777 --> 26:53.426
(groaning)

26:53.446 --> 26:55.195
(tense music)

26:56.340 --> 26:58.699
- Let's get him on this table.
Come on.

26:59.452 --> 27:00.951
Mike, hang in there.

27:01.103 --> 27:02.936
Come on, Mike.
We found a ranger's station.

27:02.955 --> 27:04.905
You're gonna be fine.
(groaning)

27:05.015 --> 27:06.031
You're fine.

27:06.108 --> 27:09.126
(Amy crying)
Come on. Hey, relax. Relax.

27:09.203 --> 27:10.352
Head up.
(groaning)

27:10.445 --> 27:12.704
- I can't just leave him.
Tim... I...

27:12.781 --> 27:15.190
My Tim is still out there.
I can't just leave him.

27:15.209 --> 27:17.784
- Listen to me, listen to me.
I hate leaving him too.

27:17.862 --> 27:20.304
We have a maniac out there,
okay? And he's coming for us.

27:20.381 --> 27:21.880
I don't want to leave Tim
out there either,

27:22.032 --> 27:24.475
but we'll go back for him when
we have a chance, I promise you.

27:24.551 --> 27:27.144
But right now, we gotta think
about survival, that's it.

27:27.295 --> 27:28.646
Do you understand?
- Yeah.

27:28.797 --> 27:33.058
- Alright, look. All these
drapes, close 'em. Please.

27:33.802 --> 27:36.395
Alright, buddy. We're good.

27:36.471 --> 27:38.322
We can't outrun 'em,
but we can hide.

27:38.399 --> 27:40.140
- I can't outrun them,
but you can, okay?

27:40.159 --> 27:41.307
Get the hell out of here.

27:41.385 --> 27:42.660
- Trust me, I'd love
to leave you,

27:42.811 --> 27:44.811
but Nik would kill me.
There's a first aid kit

27:44.830 --> 27:46.747
in his bag. Check it, please.

27:53.989 --> 27:55.655
(groaning)

27:55.733 --> 27:57.566
- I found bandages.

27:58.903 --> 28:02.513
- Alright, pressure, right
there. Let me feel your pulse.

28:03.908 --> 28:07.351
Heart's beating too fast, trying
to pump too little blood.

28:07.502 --> 28:10.579
- You don't have a bottle
of bourbon in there, do you?

28:10.597 --> 28:12.648
Or rubbing alcohol,
I don't care.

28:15.361 --> 28:19.254
- But I do got O negative
on tap.

28:19.256 --> 28:21.490
(helicopter whirring)

28:29.266 --> 28:33.001
- Last known coordinates off
the sat phone put them here.

28:38.033 --> 28:40.175
(wind howling)

28:40.961 --> 28:43.137
- Oh, my God. It's Tim.

28:44.631 --> 28:46.348
What the hell happened?

28:47.134 --> 28:48.726
- An ambush.

28:49.544 --> 28:51.453
- He's gone.

28:51.972 --> 28:54.231
So, where's everybody else?

28:56.143 --> 28:59.719
- Mike. Lisa...

29:00.555 --> 29:01.905
I know you didn't
have to do this,

29:02.057 --> 29:03.556
and I have no right
to ask you to do more,

29:03.617 --> 29:06.318
but I'm gonna need you to wait
for me back in the landing zone.

29:06.470 --> 29:08.746
Kill the lights,
but stay on the radio,

29:08.897 --> 29:12.307
and be ready.
We'll have wounded.

29:12.326 --> 29:13.900
- What are you gonna do?

29:13.919 --> 29:17.588
- That depends on what supplies
you have back in the helicopter.

29:21.460 --> 29:23.001
- This transfusion's
doing you right,

29:23.078 --> 29:24.611
but you're still losing
too much blood.

29:24.688 --> 29:26.338
I'm gonna have to cauterize
the wound, alright?

29:26.414 --> 29:28.507
- Yeah.
- See if you can find anything

29:28.583 --> 29:30.342
combustible in here, okay?
I got this.

29:30.418 --> 29:32.344
- I've got easy-strike
matches and um...

29:32.420 --> 29:34.346
there's a cooking burner
over there.

29:34.498 --> 29:37.499
- Okay, that's good.
That'll come in handy
when we decide to eat him.

29:37.518 --> 29:39.184
I got an idea.

29:39.336 --> 29:40.778
I got some bullets left
in my gun.

29:40.929 --> 29:44.172
- Save your ammo. If you want
to do something for me,

29:44.191 --> 29:45.616
just take care of Nikki.

29:45.767 --> 29:47.267
- Shut up, Mike.
Please, would you shut up?

29:47.286 --> 29:49.027
- Scabs are ugly, okay?

29:49.104 --> 29:52.122
(breathing heavily)
But they also protect us.

29:53.292 --> 29:56.668
And help us heal.
People need scabs.

29:57.521 --> 30:00.205
And Nikki, she needs you.

30:00.282 --> 30:01.781
- No, she doesn't.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.467
Alright, look,
I'm gonna tell you something,

30:03.544 --> 30:05.193
and I'm not saying this
to piss you off,

30:05.212 --> 30:07.120
I just need you to find
that will to survive, okay?

30:07.139 --> 30:11.308
When you and Nik first met,
I tried to get her back.

30:12.311 --> 30:15.720
I know, I know, I'm a terrible
person. Alright? I was jealous.

30:15.797 --> 30:18.874
I was jealous, I saw my
opportunity, I took it, but...

30:18.892 --> 30:22.394
there's no accounting for taste,
because she chose you, buddy.

30:22.470 --> 30:25.113
- Is that true?
- Yeah, it's true.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.216
You're not the backup singer.

30:28.235 --> 30:30.552
You're Freddie Mercury.

30:30.645 --> 30:31.978
Minus the coke.

30:31.997 --> 30:35.557
(laughing weakly)
And the charisma, alright?

30:35.559 --> 30:37.751
(engines revving)

30:44.677 --> 30:46.343
- Someone's outside.

30:47.162 --> 30:49.738
- Good evening, friends!

30:50.424 --> 30:52.407
Hope I didn't catch you
at a bad time.

30:52.409 --> 30:54.834
- I'm tending to a wounded man
because of you!

30:54.854 --> 30:57.337
- We'll keep this short, then.

30:57.414 --> 30:59.339
You have something of mine.

30:59.416 --> 31:02.175
If you'd be so kind
as to return it,

31:02.252 --> 31:04.086
you can resume
with your wounded.

31:04.088 --> 31:05.604
- The money.

31:06.031 --> 31:08.073
I forgot I have it.

31:09.426 --> 31:12.185
- Okay. I give you this money,

31:12.262 --> 31:15.038
you're just gonna take off?
What insurance do I have?

31:15.115 --> 31:18.524
- None. The way I see it,

31:18.544 --> 31:21.128
you have no other
option now, do you?

31:22.439 --> 31:25.090
- Alright. Give me
a little space.

31:26.110 --> 31:29.011
(groaning)

31:31.465 --> 31:33.056
(groaning)

31:33.208 --> 31:34.540
- If you won't cooperate,

31:34.560 --> 31:37.394
you leave me no choice
but to cut my losses.

31:37.545 --> 31:40.122
- Just a little bit
of gun powder, Mike.

31:40.124 --> 31:41.640
(screaming)

31:41.792 --> 31:43.433
- I'm losing patience!

31:43.510 --> 31:44.960
- Alright, buddy,
I'm not gonna lie,

31:44.962 --> 31:46.478
this is gonna hurt
like a son of a bitch,

31:46.554 --> 31:48.221
but you're bleeding
too much, okay?

31:48.223 --> 31:51.057
- Yeah.
- This is your final warning.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.485
I'm gonna count to three,

31:53.637 --> 31:58.957
and if you're not out here with
my money, we will open fire.

32:00.735 --> 32:02.068
- You ready?
- Yeah. I'm ready.

32:02.087 --> 32:03.662
- Alright. One...
- One!

32:03.738 --> 32:04.813
- Wait, I need a minute!

32:04.831 --> 32:07.482
- You don't have a minute! Two!

32:07.501 --> 32:08.574
- Three...

32:08.594 --> 32:11.169
(screaming)
You're good. We did it.

32:11.246 --> 32:13.488
We did it. You're good.
Pressure, pressure, pressure.

32:13.507 --> 32:15.098
(Mike groaning)

32:17.511 --> 32:21.163
Change of heart?
- Change of plans.

32:21.181 --> 32:22.922
- Dead man's switch.

32:23.000 --> 32:24.849
If I go down,
you go down with me.

32:25.002 --> 32:26.184
- Oh no.
- What do you want?

32:26.336 --> 32:28.853
- Why, Nik, why?
- What do you think?

32:29.673 --> 32:32.007
- I'm not leaving
without my money.

32:32.009 --> 32:34.192
- I'm taking my team and
I'm walking out of here.

32:34.344 --> 32:36.027
Search and rescue
are coming for us,

32:36.104 --> 32:39.122
so whatever you do with
your money is your concern.

32:39.274 --> 32:41.349
- Nik?
- How's Mike?

32:41.368 --> 32:44.610
- He's not good! He needs
to be medevac'd out of here.

32:44.630 --> 32:45.854
- That's not happening.

32:45.856 --> 32:47.631
- Well, this detonator
says different.

32:47.782 --> 32:49.524
- You're not a suicide bomber.

32:49.543 --> 32:52.118
You won't kill yourself.
Not over this.

32:52.137 --> 32:55.046
- I'm a cop. I saw your file,
I know who you are.

32:55.199 --> 32:57.140
- So you know you won't be
getting out of here alive.

32:57.217 --> 33:00.293
- I'm not talking about your
crimes. I'm talking about you.

33:00.370 --> 33:03.796
No wife, no children, there is
no one you can't live without.

33:03.816 --> 33:07.633
So you can't imagine the agony
of living without them.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.061
Me? I don't have to imagine.

33:10.138 --> 33:12.305
My son went missing
six years ago,

33:12.399 --> 33:14.566
and every day
that passed without him,

33:14.718 --> 33:16.551
I wished I could trade
my life in for his.

33:16.553 --> 33:19.404
I feel the same about the man
in that cabin. I love him.

33:19.556 --> 33:21.848
Now, to you, those are
silly words, but to me,

33:21.925 --> 33:23.725
they're the air I breathe.

33:23.727 --> 33:25.168
Without him, I would suffocate.

33:25.912 --> 33:27.653
So if you want
to call my bluff,

33:27.731 --> 33:29.397
by all means, go ahead!

33:29.399 --> 33:32.259
I've held this detonator
for six years.

33:34.071 --> 33:37.097
Maybe it's about time
I let it go. Hmm?

33:38.350 --> 33:40.925
- I'm not leaving
without my money.

33:41.078 --> 33:43.186
- Understood.

33:44.097 --> 33:46.732
Hey, Jay! The money!

33:47.526 --> 33:50.027
(tense music)

33:57.110 --> 34:01.279
- What the hell is this?
They took a million-eight.

34:01.431 --> 34:03.448
- They burned the money.
They were freezing,

34:03.525 --> 34:04.875
they burned the money
to stay warm.

34:05.026 --> 34:08.603
- You got your money.
- This isn't over.

34:08.622 --> 34:11.048
I will come for you.

34:13.868 --> 34:15.610
- You're out of your mind, Nik.

34:15.629 --> 34:18.113
I know I'm crazy,
but you're on another level.

34:18.131 --> 34:19.447
- Jay, Jay, just listen.

34:19.466 --> 34:21.058
- We gotta get
that receiver off of you.

34:21.209 --> 34:22.117
- Listen!
- Listen to what?

34:22.119 --> 34:23.285
- That receiver's not on me.

34:23.287 --> 34:25.120
- Then where the hell is it?
(explosion)

34:25.122 --> 34:27.689
(screaming)

34:32.053 --> 34:33.628
- You'd be surprised
how many explosives

34:33.647 --> 34:35.322
S&R carry on the chopper.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.325
- You were bluffing?

34:40.487 --> 34:41.653
- Hey, baby, baby...

34:42.247 --> 34:43.805
Come one, baby, wake up.

34:43.824 --> 34:46.324
- Listen to me. You're gonna fly
back with them.

34:46.401 --> 34:48.159
I'm gonna go check
on Winchester and his guys.

34:48.312 --> 34:50.328
When that helicopter comes back,
I'm going to get Tim,

34:50.405 --> 34:53.331
and I'm bringing him home. Hey,
I promise you. I promise you.

34:53.483 --> 34:56.093
- You have to wake up, Mike.

34:59.264 --> 35:03.158
- Hey, how is he?
- He's still in surgery.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.602
- He's gonna be okay, okay?
The candles said so.

35:05.753 --> 35:08.663
- I called the State Department
and told them about Danzomo.

35:08.665 --> 35:11.090
- Yeah.
- I wish that I could do more.

35:11.110 --> 35:12.500
- Yeah, me and you both.

35:12.594 --> 35:14.111
(scoffs)

35:15.505 --> 35:18.690
- Your father... what is...?
- Yeah, yeah. Um...

35:18.766 --> 35:21.451
He, uh, he refused to pay
the ransom because he thought

35:21.528 --> 35:24.529
it would encourage
more kidnappings.

35:24.606 --> 35:29.042
So um, my sisters,
my mother, he...

35:30.854 --> 35:33.279
He sacrificed me
to protect them.

35:33.357 --> 35:35.357
- That's horrific.
- Yeah.

35:35.359 --> 35:37.783
- He must be filled
with shame and regret.

35:37.803 --> 35:41.696
- Trust me, he doesn't know
the meanings to those words.

35:41.698 --> 35:45.308
- Or it's the reason
he invited you to his party.

35:45.960 --> 35:48.553
Only one way to find out, right?

35:48.630 --> 35:50.105
- Yes, yeah.

35:51.817 --> 35:55.560
<i> (Nikki:) I just read</i>
<i> the medical examiner's</i>
<i> report on Tim.</i>

35:56.229 --> 36:01.324
The punch ruptured his spleen
and caused internal bleeding.

36:01.401 --> 36:03.401
There was nothing
you could've done.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.999
I know that that doesn't make
the pain feel any easier.

36:10.485 --> 36:12.878
But if I were you,
I'd want to know.

36:14.064 --> 36:17.257
- Tim and I got engaged
on the mountain.

36:18.068 --> 36:20.135
That's why we went.

36:22.923 --> 36:24.181
(sniffling)

36:24.257 --> 36:26.666
But am I still engaged?

36:27.244 --> 36:29.427
Do I... Do I take this off?

36:30.189 --> 36:33.398
- You do what your heart
tells you to do.

36:35.585 --> 36:38.695
- Is it true you and Detective
Sherman are engaged?

36:39.439 --> 36:40.530
- Yes.

36:41.533 --> 36:44.618
- Why don't you have a ring?
- I do.

36:46.354 --> 36:50.281
It's in his trunk.
- Why?

36:50.434 --> 36:52.083
- Well...

36:53.695 --> 36:55.212
'Cause I'm an idiot.

36:56.773 --> 37:02.110
- Hey! Hands off my body.
Or at least buy me dinner first.

37:02.128 --> 37:04.036
- Rachel, hi.
- So...

37:04.056 --> 37:06.163
This is where
the necromancy happens.

37:06.316 --> 37:10.618
The decor is a little on the
nose, but uh, I like it!

37:10.620 --> 37:12.787
Hey, they bought you
a 3D printer?!

37:12.789 --> 37:14.213
- Oh...
- They won't even fix

37:14.291 --> 37:16.066
my paper jams.
- Okay, this is really

37:16.217 --> 37:17.809
specifically calibrated,
actually.

37:17.961 --> 37:19.627
- Coroner's office has none
of this stuff.

37:19.629 --> 37:21.387
- Hey, sorry,
please don't touch that.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.147
- Hey! You're the one
putting your hands

37:23.300 --> 37:24.649
where they don't belong.

37:25.226 --> 37:29.487
- Oh, this isn't actually--
- That's not mine, is it?

37:30.231 --> 37:32.916
- They never look like their
profile picture, do they?

37:33.067 --> 37:36.419
(chuckling)
Um, your date's over here, uh,

37:36.496 --> 37:39.814
and we ran a full
facial recognition so...

37:39.907 --> 37:41.483
But it's completely
uncontaminated.

37:41.501 --> 37:43.576
The only body I touched today
was my own.

37:43.653 --> 37:45.077
- Uh...

37:45.155 --> 37:46.337
- Oh, my God.

37:46.490 --> 37:48.748
That's not... I didn't.
- Wow.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.116
- Please forget
that I said that.

37:50.193 --> 37:51.826
- No chance. And I gotta go.

37:51.828 --> 37:54.920
Next time you have a body
for me, give me a heads up.

37:54.998 --> 37:56.564
- Yes.

37:58.184 --> 38:00.110
- Here's my card.

38:01.004 --> 38:02.362
- Sorry.

38:03.006 --> 38:04.281
- Use it.

38:04.432 --> 38:07.358
- Yeah. It's cool.
I've... That's...

38:07.511 --> 38:09.119
(chuckling)

38:14.534 --> 38:15.959
Yeah.

38:18.705 --> 38:21.006
(indistinct announcement)

38:21.967 --> 38:23.591
- Hey, baby.

38:25.028 --> 38:26.118
- Hmm.

38:26.196 --> 38:28.013
- How do you feel?

38:28.865 --> 38:31.382
- About as good as I look.

38:31.459 --> 38:34.719
But... I'm better now
that you're here.

38:34.796 --> 38:38.723
- You know, Doc says that
you're one of the luckiest
guys he knows.

38:38.875 --> 38:39.983
One centimeter to the left,

38:40.134 --> 38:41.559
and there would've been
nothing Jay could do.

38:41.636 --> 38:45.046
- Oh, well... I slept during
the end of the movie.

38:45.065 --> 38:46.548
What happened?

38:46.566 --> 38:48.883
- Well, the good guys
were good...

38:48.885 --> 38:50.718
- Hmm.
- Bad guys are caught.

38:50.737 --> 38:52.812
- Yeah?
(chuckling)

38:52.831 --> 38:56.057
- And I asked you to marry me.

38:56.076 --> 38:58.293
- Well, talk about
a wow finish, huh?

38:59.338 --> 39:01.671
- A trunk is no place
for a ring.

39:02.341 --> 39:04.065
- Well, they cut my pants off.

39:04.734 --> 39:06.843
- That's not where I thought
this was going.

39:06.994 --> 39:10.088
- No, my pants, I need my pants.

39:10.164 --> 39:11.739
- Oh, okay.

39:11.758 --> 39:14.926
For the record, I just kind
of asked you to marry me,

39:15.078 --> 39:16.761
so if we could, uh...

39:17.747 --> 39:21.024
If we could sideline
the whole pants thing and...

39:21.935 --> 39:24.694
get back to the question
at hand.

39:25.438 --> 39:26.696
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

39:31.428 --> 39:34.520
I thought it was in the trunk.
- I was being metaphorical.

39:34.598 --> 39:37.523
It was either that or admit
that putting them in my pants

39:37.601 --> 39:41.544
created and insane amount
of chafing.

39:42.363 --> 39:44.622
- You carried it with you.

39:45.199 --> 39:50.345
- It... You... Us.

39:52.282 --> 39:56.893
For better or uh, well,
at the moment, for worse.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.971
(chuckling)
Talk about bad timing, huh?

40:00.123 --> 40:01.981
- Oh, babe.

40:02.809 --> 40:04.550
If today taught me anything,

40:04.552 --> 40:07.570
it's that there is
no such thing.

40:14.971 --> 40:16.638
(laughing)

40:16.656 --> 40:18.581
- I don't understand.

40:19.084 --> 40:21.233
He invited me.

40:21.311 --> 40:23.161
- I invited you, Kemi.

40:23.237 --> 40:25.922
I thought it might be
a pleasant surprise,

40:26.073 --> 40:29.074
but when he found out,
he was quite insistent...

40:29.152 --> 40:33.488
- That his daughter be left out
in the cold? Again?

40:33.490 --> 40:35.323
- I'm sorry.

40:35.416 --> 40:36.933
But you can't come in.

40:37.084 --> 40:38.993
- You know, as a child,

40:39.012 --> 40:42.730
I used to cry because
Father was always gone.

40:44.517 --> 40:48.111
But now I cry
because he is a bastard.

40:51.599 --> 40:53.992
(soft music)

40:55.436 --> 40:56.453
(door closing)

40:56.529 --> 40:58.621
(breathing shakily)

41:06.131 --> 41:08.189
- Keith was focused.

41:08.191 --> 41:10.616
He listened intently
to what everyone said.

41:10.635 --> 41:13.377
- That's good. I mean, you said
that he met someone?

41:13.530 --> 41:17.882
- Oliver, yes. He encouraged
Keith to open up.

41:18.702 --> 41:21.478
<i> As I mentioned when we first</i>
<i> met, that's one of my goals,</i>

41:21.554 --> 41:25.315
<i>is to expose your son to people</i>
<i> with similar experiences</i>

41:25.466 --> 41:27.725
<i>in the hopes of encouraging him</i>

41:27.877 --> 41:30.211
<i> to feel comfortable</i>
<i> opening up about his own.</i>

41:30.230 --> 41:32.638
<i> (Jason): Yeah, I mean,</i>
<i> that's definitely gonna take</i>

41:32.657 --> 41:34.991
some time. Him opening up.

41:35.994 --> 41:37.902
Unfortunately,
he gets that from me.

41:38.054 --> 41:39.645
- Do you want to talk
about that?

41:39.723 --> 41:43.725
- Talk about what?
- Suffering in silence?

41:44.485 --> 41:48.487
- Uh... Yeah, yeah,
I guess I can do that.

41:49.249 --> 41:54.994
- Hey. Uh, thanks for the ride
today, and for, uh....

41:55.013 --> 41:58.348
listening, or whatever.

41:58.499 --> 42:00.141
(phone chimes)

42:03.522 --> 42:05.104
(ominous music)

42:44.788 --> 42:44.978
Subtitling: difuze
