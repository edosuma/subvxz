01:11.122 --> 01:14.813
Stupid shopping list,
turning food into work.

01:14.848 --> 01:17.634
- Bart!
- Look at me! I'm doin' something!

01:19.393 --> 01:20.889
You better settle down, boy,

01:20.924 --> 01:24.137
or I'll drag you into the blind
spot of that security camera.

01:24.172 --> 01:28.028
and beat you with one of those
big thick women's magazines

01:28.063 --> 01:29.829
with all the ads in it!

01:29.864 --> 01:32.869
Mr. Homer, why don't you forget
your worries with this...

01:32.904 --> 01:35.196
the last lottery ticket on the roll.

01:35.231 --> 01:37.324
They say the last one is lucky!

01:37.359 --> 01:38.493
Unlike all the others.

01:38.528 --> 01:40.123
Lucky!

01:40.158 --> 01:41.158
Or not.

01:41.531 --> 01:44.196
Hmm, you make a good case.
I'll take it!

01:44.231 --> 01:45.929
Dad, look at me! Look at me!

01:47.134 --> 01:48.473
Cannonball!

01:51.227 --> 01:52.227
No!

01:52.262 --> 01:54.547
I'll take that last
lottery ticket, Apu.

02:00.421 --> 02:01.421
Again!

02:03.232 --> 02:05.073
I won! I won!

02:05.255 --> 02:07.757
$50,000! Ponder this, Homer.

02:07.792 --> 02:10.854
This ticket would have been yours
if your kid hadn't been screwin' around.

02:10.889 --> 02:14.916
That is true. Another ironic 
"Tale of the Kwik-E-Mart."

02:18.236 --> 02:21.673
You just cost me $200,000!

02:21.852 --> 02:25.552
- I thought it was 50.
- I was gonna bet it on the dogs!

02:26.854 --> 02:30.966
All the groceries seem
to have been balled up in anger.

02:33.498 --> 02:36.312
That kid has become
a Dennis-level menace!

02:36.473 --> 02:39.814
Now, Homer, boys will be boys.

02:39.849 --> 02:43.368
Bart cost us $50,000!

02:54.267 --> 02:57.000
I'm going to Moe's.

02:57.628 --> 03:00.019
<i>Lenny, Lenny, he's our guy!</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:02.402
<i>Got the ticket Homer didn't buy!</i>

03:04.211 --> 03:06.425
Oh, cheer up, Homer.
The drinks are on Lenny.

03:06.460 --> 03:09.279
I don't want your pity booze.
I'll pay for it myself.

03:09.649 --> 03:12.089
Uh, I gotta check with Lenny on that.
Uh, is that all right,

03:12.124 --> 03:14.973
Nope, Lucky Lenny's buying
all the drinks tonight.

03:15.008 --> 03:16.935
Sorry, Homer,
but here's a compromise:

03:16.970 --> 03:18.690
why don't you both pay for the drink?

03:19.877 --> 03:21.550
And tip.

03:22.673 --> 03:25.388
I just want to tell you all that
even before I won this money,

03:25.423 --> 03:28.844
I was the luckiest guy in the world
'cause I got friends like you.

03:30.136 --> 03:32.968
That's why I'm spending my
remaing Scratcher winnings

03:33.003 --> 03:35.287
on a kick-ass party
for all my friends!

03:43.727 --> 03:47.216
Where's Bart? We're gonna be late
for Lenny's party.

03:49.280 --> 03:50.678
Don't waste your shot, Bart.

03:50.713 --> 03:53.734
You've got just enough cat pee
to soak two dorks.

03:57.835 --> 04:00.772
Bart Simpson! Did you just spray
water on me?!

04:01.811 --> 04:03.483
Uh... it was water this morning.

04:05.026 --> 04:08.945
Dang that Bart! Thanks to him, I have
to wear my backup dress,

04:08.980 --> 04:12.817
- which makes my arms look fat.
- Oh, you look great.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.879
Ha ha! You feel self-conscious.

04:17.494 --> 04:19.947
Why can't our son just behave?

04:19.983 --> 04:24.881
Well, Marge, you did have that one
sip of alcohol while you were pregnant.

04:25.882 --> 04:30.105
I now christen this ship
the "USS Float 'N' Shoot!"

04:37.578 --> 04:39.918
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

04:39.953 --> 04:41.576
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

04:43.114 --> 04:45.060
Mmm, that was unforgivable.

04:45.095 --> 04:47.605
But I'm beginning to think
that Bart's bad behavior

04:47.640 --> 04:52.307
- is more than just a phase.
- Bart's flicking boogers on me!

04:52.342 --> 04:55.142
They're not boogers!
They're clumps of rubber cement.

04:55.177 --> 04:57.001
That I stored in my nose.

05:01.394 --> 05:04.601
Stop it, both of you!
Don't make me drive into that tree

05:04.636 --> 05:05.962
You know I will!

05:10.688 --> 05:14.758
No flicking boogers,
and no driving into trees!

05:14.793 --> 05:16.097
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

05:24.727 --> 05:26.441
Wow, Lenny went all out!

05:26.926 --> 05:31.249
<i>In the beginning, there was darkness,
so God created man.</i>

05:31.284 --> 05:33.524
<i>But man was alone.</i>

05:33.559 --> 05:37.768
<i>God created the animals and birds.</i>

05:37.803 --> 05:40.120
<i>But man was still lonely.</i>

05:41.636 --> 05:45.436
<i>So God said,
"Let there be friends!"</i>

05:45.471 --> 05:48.282
<i>Thank you for being a friend,</i>

05:48.317 --> 05:51.403
<i>Traveled down the road
and back again</i>

05:51.438 --> 05:56.679
<i>Your heart is true,
You're a pal and a confidant</i>

05:56.987 --> 05:59.646
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

05:59.681 --> 06:02.060
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

06:02.579 --> 06:04.914
<i>Thank you for being a friend</i>

06:04.949 --> 06:07.724
Thank you for letting me
take home the centerpiece.

06:07.759 --> 06:11.027
These are going right
on my mom's grave.

06:12.692 --> 06:15.453
<i>Thank you for being a friend.</i>

06:16.354 --> 06:18.649
Lenny, it was
pretty cool of you

06:18.684 --> 06:21.204
to spend your lotto winnings
on your pals.

06:21.362 --> 06:23.623
It was worth it so everyone
could have a wonderful evening

06:23.658 --> 06:25.802
and go home with a gift bag.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.048
Vacuuming robot!

06:36.483 --> 06:41.219
Now, before you all leave, I know
everyone hates vacuuming, and loves robots...

07:09.447 --> 07:12.599
These innocent robots couldn't
have done this on their own.

07:13.156 --> 07:15.721
Someone would've had
to turn them all on at once,

07:16.024 --> 07:19.662
and then imbue them with some
kind of malevolent sentience.

07:21.178 --> 07:22.431
Yep, there it is.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.934
Well, whoever did this must be
long gone by now, Chief.

07:25.054 --> 07:27.323
I don't know how we'll ever catch him.

07:27.832 --> 07:30.048
Kill! Kill! Kill!

07:30.649 --> 07:32.405
Hold it right there, Bart!

07:32.440 --> 07:34.665
Can you tell us anything
about who did this?

07:34.700 --> 07:37.113
<i>Bart make Bot bad!</i>

07:40.839 --> 07:43.327
- Uh, I can explain.
- Kill the child!

07:46.761 --> 07:48.420
Bart, I've had it with you!

07:48.455 --> 07:52.082
- I'm taking away all your TV privileges.
- You already did that.

07:52.117 --> 07:54.483
- Okay, then videogames.
- That, too.

07:54.518 --> 07:56.888
No more non-dice board games.

07:56.923 --> 07:59.098
What? You can't take my Balderdash!

07:59.133 --> 08:00.377
I just did.

08:01.843 --> 08:03.953
I don't mean to be bad.

08:03.988 --> 08:06.366
I don't know why I do
the things I do.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.560
No one understands me.
I wish I had a different family.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.998
I feel exactly the same way.

08:18.634 --> 08:20.974
Oh, my God.

08:21.009 --> 08:23.223
You look like a dorky version of me!

08:23.258 --> 08:26.162
And you look like
a dimwitted version of me!

08:26.591 --> 08:29.570
And you two are
ten-year-old versions of me!

08:29.605 --> 08:31.952
The three of us could create
quite a lot of mischief,

08:31.987 --> 08:33.660
but I have to fly back to New York.

08:33.696 --> 08:35.581
That's where my wife and I live.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.090
That's her. You want to see pictures
of our kids?

08:42.498 --> 08:44.624
name's Simon Woosterfield.

08:44.659 --> 08:47.141
"Woosterfield"? Your family owns
this place!

08:47.176 --> 08:49.374
And Woosterfield Arena!
Bonnie Raitt played there!

08:49.409 --> 08:50.888
You guys must be loaded!

08:50.923 --> 08:54.595
Yes. No, but the funny thing
about being rich

08:54.630 --> 08:56.919
is sometimes you wake up feeling...

08:56.954 --> 08:59.566
Terrific? Incredible?
Happy as a clown?

08:59.601 --> 09:01.197
Oh, yeah, I'm livin' the dream.

09:05.365 --> 09:07.972
Wouldn't it be hilarious
if we switched places

09:08.007 --> 09:10.145
and lived each other's
lives for a while?

09:10.953 --> 09:13.880
I'm pretty attached
to my family, and...

09:13.915 --> 09:16.300
Get out here, boy!
I want to punish you

09:16.335 --> 09:19.427
- before I get drunk and merciful!
- Deal.

09:19.462 --> 09:22.057
My father's name is Homer.
My mother's name is Mom.

09:22.092 --> 09:24.495
My sister's name is Lisa,
but everyone calls her Loser.

09:25.536 --> 09:28.853
My butler's name is Chester. I have a brother
named Devon and a sister named Quenly.

09:28.888 --> 09:30.877
Oh, and my horse is called Shadowfax.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.484
You can't miss him. He's the
only Lipizzaner in our stable.

09:33.519 --> 09:35.064
Lipizzaner... got it.

09:36.494 --> 09:39.068
There you are, Master Simon!

09:39.596 --> 09:41.884
Thank you, uh, Lipizzaner.

09:41.919 --> 09:44.170
As you say, sir. Watch your head.

09:49.908 --> 09:51.911
You ruin everything!

09:51.946 --> 09:53.499
Driver, laugh at those people for me.

09:53.534 --> 09:54.778
My pleasure, sir.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.814
McMansion. McMansion.

10:06.849 --> 10:08.581
McMansion.

10:08.616 --> 10:10.429
McDonald's?

10:10.464 --> 10:12.353
McDreamy.

10:12.388 --> 10:14.084
McSteamy.

10:14.119 --> 10:15.707
McMansion.

10:15.742 --> 10:17.309
Fleetwood Mac,

10:17.344 --> 10:18.941
and Macauley Culkin.

10:22.268 --> 10:24.149
And this is your home, sir.

10:24.184 --> 10:26.931
But of course you already knew that.

10:26.966 --> 10:28.476
Awesome!

10:28.511 --> 10:29.874
Awesome!

10:29.909 --> 10:31.162
Awesome!

10:35.179 --> 10:37.418
This is my bedroom?

10:37.453 --> 10:39.655
A candy corn volcano!

10:39.690 --> 10:41.630
A ceiling from Saddam's palace!

10:42.620 --> 10:44.451
Ooh, and a racecar bed.

10:45.831 --> 10:47.727
That really races!

10:49.894 --> 10:51.621
Wow, a cool poster of Joe Montana!

10:51.656 --> 10:53.167
It's not a poster.

10:53.202 --> 10:55.592
I'm the real deal. Every day I stand here

10:55.627 --> 10:58.361
the family donates a million
dollars to Notre Dame.

10:58.396 --> 11:01.166
Did you know the words "Notre Dame" are French,
but the team is

11:01.201 --> 11:04.035
the Fighting Irish? That's the kind of thing
I think about in here.

11:04.070 --> 11:06.322
- Back in the poster, gabby.
- Yes, sir.

11:10.637 --> 11:13.340
Milhouse, it's me. Check out 
the caller ID on your phone.

11:13.375 --> 11:17.526
"Blocked Number"? That service is $3.65 a month.

11:17.561 --> 11:22.046
Did you switch places with a millionaire kid
who looks just like you?

11:22.081 --> 11:24.090
Just sit tight. I'm sending a car.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.473
Why are these noodles orange?

11:32.590 --> 11:35.833
I made it with Cheetos,
just like you like it.

11:35.868 --> 11:38.771
If the sauce is too thick,
I can add more root beer.

11:38.943 --> 11:40.324
Maybe I'm just not hungry.

11:40.359 --> 11:43.401
Human garbage can to the rescue.

11:44.274 --> 11:46.569
Mmm... so at work today,

11:46.604 --> 11:49.142
we got a memo saying
everyone's getting new chairs.

11:49.177 --> 11:51.855
- Father, could you...
- Talk louder? You bet.

11:51.890 --> 11:55.596
Naturally, I threw my old chair
in the Dumpster right away,

11:55.631 --> 11:58.764
but then Lenny said:
"No, that was the new chair.

11:58.799 --> 12:00.409
That memo was two months old."

12:00.444 --> 12:02.696
So now I'm sitting on an orange crate.

12:02.731 --> 12:05.662
- I never felt so...
- Please stop spitting food on me!

12:06.461 --> 12:09.727
Keep your meal in your mouth,
you semiliterate spew-monkey.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.459
That's it, boy. You're 
going to bed without supper.

12:16.514 --> 12:18.580
That was an odd thing
for Bart to say.

12:18.615 --> 12:21.856
Maybe he's going through... certain changes.

12:21.891 --> 12:25.355
If that boy thinks I'm paying
to put him through four years of puberty,

12:25.390 --> 12:29.477
forget it.
I'm made of hormones.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.033
Mr. La-Di-Da...

12:33.675 --> 12:37.496
This is the greatest great hall
I've ever eaten in, Bart.

12:38.949 --> 12:40.666
I mean Simon.

12:45.439 --> 12:47.587
This must be my half-brother
and half-sister.

12:47.622 --> 12:50.290
They're beautiful.

12:50.325 --> 12:53.804
I mean, just the girl.
I didn't notice the beautiful boy.

12:53.839 --> 12:57.900
So I said, "Dad, I wanted a
Range Rover, not a Land Rover.

12:57.935 --> 13:00.557
This is the worst
Martin Luther King Day ever."

13:00.592 --> 13:04.356
Well, well, if it isn't
our half-wit half-brother.

13:10.379 --> 13:12.610
The old hot spoon. But why?

13:12.645 --> 13:15.771
Because you're our half-brother,
you're blocking our full

13:15.806 --> 13:18.913
- inheritance and we hate you.
- Oh, now I get it.

13:20.893 --> 13:23.879
Bart, I have a crush
on your new sister.

13:23.914 --> 13:25.445
You had a crush on my old sister.

13:25.480 --> 13:28.172
Yeah, but that was never going
to happen.

13:30.972 --> 13:33.452
Give me back my newspaper.

13:33.487 --> 13:35.462
Homer, it's not a real paper.

13:35.497 --> 13:37.392
It's a rubber chew toy.

13:37.427 --> 13:41.258
For your information, The Daily Growl
is the only newspaper

13:41.293 --> 13:44.368
that's not afraid to say how great
this country is.

13:45.534 --> 13:47.147
How's the war going?

13:47.182 --> 13:48.627
We're winning? That's great.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.344
And our standing abroad?

13:50.379 --> 13:51.779
Fantastic.

13:56.003 --> 13:59.766
This place is insane. Tonight,
I got sent to bed without dinner.

13:59.801 --> 14:02.705
Oh, yeah. Well, what's up
with your brother and sister?

14:02.740 --> 14:04.848
They're jealous because

14:04.883 --> 14:07.614
my father left their mother
to be with my mother, to...

14:07.649 --> 14:09.831
Eh, you lost me. Well, got to go.

14:09.866 --> 14:11.838
Enjoy the upper-lower
middle class.

14:14.649 --> 14:17.631
Bart, honey, I saw
you didn't like your dinner,

14:17.666 --> 14:21.257
so I thought you might like
pepperoni pizza with the crust cut off.

14:21.292 --> 14:24.847
Now, let me tuck you in,
fluff your pillow,

14:24.882 --> 14:28.870
and sprinkle a little fairy dust
to keep the monsters away.

14:28.905 --> 14:30.207
It's cinnamon.

14:31.744 --> 14:33.696
Nighty-night, sweetheart.

14:35.587 --> 14:37.283
I could get used to this.

14:39.299 --> 14:44.046
Fancy party. This is like a rap video
before the rappers show up.

14:46.993 --> 14:49.886
Simon, have you ever seen
the family mausoleum?

14:49.921 --> 14:51.917
All the Woosterfields
will be buried here.

14:51.952 --> 14:55.935
Do you know that after a hundred years
dead bodies turn to red licorice?

14:56.655 --> 14:58.124
Whoa-ho, let me at it.

15:01.465 --> 15:03.511
<i>Help! Let me out.</i>

15:03.546 --> 15:05.957
<i>I have my doubts about this licorice!</i>

15:07.780 --> 15:09.786
Oh, Mr. Burns, I'm really sorry.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.053
Nonsense, young Woosterfield.

15:12.088 --> 15:13.956
Your fortune is greater than mine.
It is, it is I

15:13.991 --> 15:17.865
who am at your service.
Smithers, fetch us some lemonade.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.671
- All they had was Sunnytime Pink.
- Premix?

15:24.706 --> 15:28.759
I beg your forgiveness, lad.
Smithers, pour it down your pants.

15:30.559 --> 15:34.242
Now, squish about in those pants,
rewetting every hour.

15:38.236 --> 15:39.637
Come with me.

15:41.061 --> 15:42.372
You know, Master Simon,

15:42.407 --> 15:44.892
I too was once the youngest
in a wealthy family.

15:44.927 --> 15:47.185
You were once the youngest
of something?

15:47.220 --> 15:51.690
But fortune ended up smiling on me
while snuffing the life from my siblings.

15:51.886 --> 15:54.018
My older brother was trampled
by a horse.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.611
My sister died of a poisoned potato.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.693
My twin was shot.
That girl was stabbed

15:57.728 --> 15:59.452
He ate another poisoned potato.

15:59.487 --> 16:02.312
Spontaneous combustion.
Fell down a well. Potato. Potato,

16:02.347 --> 16:04.119
and impaled on the Chrysler Building.

16:05.265 --> 16:07.185
Wow, only you survived.

16:07.220 --> 16:09.992
Which means the entire fortune went to you.

16:10.027 --> 16:11.802
Yes, funny that.

16:11.837 --> 16:16.465
A word of caution, young Woosterfield:
watch out for those closest to you.

16:16.717 --> 16:19.100
- Devon and Quenly?
- You don't know when they'll strike...

16:19.135 --> 16:22.175
a boating accident,
a mishap during a ski trip,

16:22.210 --> 16:25.516
but rest assured, one way or another,
they will do you in.

16:25.732 --> 16:29.509
Oh, my God. Simon set me up.

16:29.544 --> 16:31.039
And all this time I thought he wanted the life

16:31.074 --> 16:33.943
of a stranger he met in the bathroom.

16:33.978 --> 16:37.152
Now, would you care to continue this conversation
on the teeter-totter?

16:39.303 --> 16:41.220
Why won't you come down?

16:41.255 --> 16:45.474
I told you I only weigh as
much as my clothes and keys.

16:54.314 --> 16:57.839
So, i looked down the barrel
of my Winchester rifle,

16:57.874 --> 17:02.010
I pulled the trigger,
and I shot that buffalo.

17:02.353 --> 17:04.054
You shot a buffalo?

17:04.984 --> 17:06.817
You were listening?

17:06.852 --> 17:10.768
That means I've got to come up
with an ending for this nonsense.

17:10.803 --> 17:12.407
Bart, what are you doing?

17:12.443 --> 17:14.690
Politely listening
to our grandfather.

17:15.993 --> 17:18.376
It was the war to end all wars,

17:18.411 --> 17:20.125
but Pepsi would not give up.

17:20.160 --> 17:22.913
They continued to challenge Coke.

17:24.036 --> 17:25.166
Okay, listen, you.

17:25.202 --> 17:28.695
I don't know who you are or what
you've done with the real Bart, but...

17:29.146 --> 17:31.635
God help me, I want him back.

17:31.670 --> 17:33.772
I don't know what you're talking about.

17:35.632 --> 17:38.088
Oh. The real Bart would have
thrown me out the window.

17:38.215 --> 17:39.673
He would have defenestrated you?

17:39.708 --> 17:41.967
You're just digging yourself even deeper.

17:44.439 --> 17:45.940
Come on, Bart.
You've got to get out of here.

17:45.975 --> 17:47.859
Pack like you've never
packed before.

17:47.894 --> 17:50.138
You know,
I have never packed before.

17:53.015 --> 17:55.230
- This is hard.
- So, you're packing.

17:55.265 --> 17:57.649
- You must have already heard.
- Heard what?

17:57.787 --> 18:00.402
- We're going to Aspen.
- On a little ski trip.

18:00.569 --> 18:02.107
Ski trip?

18:02.142 --> 18:05.289
<i>You won't know how they'll
strike... a boating accident...</i>

18:05.904 --> 18:07.034
<i>...a ski trip.</i>

18:08.171 --> 18:10.861
<i>Scrubbing you</i>

18:10.896 --> 18:14.683
<i>Is easy 'cause you've been pre-rinsed</i>

18:14.718 --> 18:18.086
<i>And when you're covered, with goo</i>

18:18.378 --> 18:21.882
<i>That's when I'm scrubbing you.</i>

18:21.917 --> 18:23.680
<i>Scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub!</i>

18:23.715 --> 18:25.482
<i>Scrub-bub-bub-bub-bub...</i>

18:25.517 --> 18:28.374
Mom, "Bart" has something to tell you.

18:29.175 --> 18:31.767
I don't like the look
of those air quotes.

18:31.802 --> 18:35.562
So now Bart is on his way to Aspen,
where they're going to try to kill him.

18:35.929 --> 18:39.274
Thank you, future Bart, for traveling back
through time to warn us.

18:49.055 --> 18:52.579
Boy, Aspen sure is ritzy.
Even the winos look better.

18:53.651 --> 18:55.343
Uh, we're champagnos.

18:55.378 --> 18:56.875
Who wants a mimosa?

18:58.975 --> 19:01.664
Uh... this trail is for
experienced skiers.

19:01.699 --> 19:03.974
Which is what you'll be
if you make it to the bottom.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.133
Which you won't.

19:07.739 --> 19:11.390
- Soon he'll be dead.
- And we'll split the inheritance.

19:11.643 --> 19:13.529
Yes, split.

19:13.564 --> 19:15.018
Potato?

19:17.912 --> 19:19.064
There's Bart!

19:19.199 --> 19:21.970
This looks like a job
for Captain Crazy.

19:22.005 --> 19:24.319
Up, up, and away!

19:24.469 --> 19:27.281
Oh, come on, gravity.
You used to be cool.

19:32.155 --> 19:33.155
Occupied.

19:47.748 --> 19:50.345
Two hot chocolates, please.

19:51.088 --> 19:53.382
- Are you guests at the lodge?
- No.

19:59.444 --> 20:01.565
You know, I feel sorry for you, kid.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.068
Going back to that cold,
loveless family.

20:05.552 --> 20:07.205
I'll survive.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.721
Your favorite, sir.

20:08.756 --> 20:13.285
Hot fudge sundae with
gold leaf and diamond flakes.

20:15.311 --> 20:17.748
Take me with you. I'll be anything
and everything you want.

20:17.783 --> 20:20.500
Don't leave me here with them!

20:21.043 --> 20:24.594
I never thought I'd say this,
but I missed you guys.

20:24.629 --> 20:26.196
Even, what's her name... Lisa.

20:29.163 --> 20:33.500
Now we tuck in the tummy,
the tushy, and the tootsies.

20:41.016 --> 20:42.731
This is the life.
