01:10.975 --> 01:12.845
Oh, God.

01:27.676 --> 01:30.180
What the fuck?

02:21.015 --> 02:24.221
:
Help! Help!

02:24.288 --> 02:28.196
Help!
Help!

02:28.263 --> 02:31.737
Help! Help!

02:31.803 --> 02:32.939
Help!

03:05.003 --> 03:06.439
Okay.

03:07.842 --> 03:09.913
Okay.

03:36.567 --> 03:38.169
<i>
Hello, Dr. Strauss.</i>

03:38.236 --> 03:40.373
<i>Uh, my name is Gene Bollinger.</i>

03:40.440 --> 03:42.444
<i>I was hoping
to get started in a course</i>

03:42.512 --> 03:43.914
<i>of psychotherapy.</i>

03:43.981 --> 03:45.918
<i>I thought you might be able
to help me</i>

03:45.985 --> 03:47.420
<i>with some of my problems.</i>

03:48.123 --> 03:49.692
<i>So, uh, yeah.</i>

03:49.759 --> 03:52.163
<i>I guess I'll call you back,
uh, if that's okay.</i>

03:52.230 --> 03:53.700
<i>I'm a little hard to reach.</i>

03:54.434 --> 03:56.873
<i>Yeah, okay, thanks.</i>

04:07.094 --> 04:09.866
<i>Hi, it's Shoshana.
Leave a message.</i>

04:09.933 --> 04:12.070
- Hey, honey. It's Dad.

04:12.137 --> 04:13.240
Just checking in.

04:13.306 --> 04:15.243
I'm in sessions until 8:00.

04:15.310 --> 04:16.980
Bye-bye.

04:23.527 --> 04:25.664
<i>What can I help you with, Gene?</i>

04:28.369 --> 04:30.841
My dad beat the shit out of me.

04:32.177 --> 04:34.916
A lot, uh, when I was a kid.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.058
And I think it fucked me up.

04:39.826 --> 04:41.863
That's a tough thing
to go through.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.936
You said it fucked you up.

04:45.003 --> 04:46.807
In what ways?

04:46.873 --> 04:48.811
All ways.

04:50.380 --> 04:51.684
Like I'm not content.

04:51.750 --> 04:54.455
I don't have a good social life.

04:54.523 --> 04:56.760
I get angry.

04:59.766 --> 05:03.039
That's the sort of thing
you help people with, right?

05:04.008 --> 05:05.878
Yes.

05:06.646 --> 05:08.282
So, I read your book.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.753
Oh.

05:09.820 --> 05:11.923
- What'd you think?
- It was good.

05:11.990 --> 05:16.032
I thought, you know,
this guy is a real expert.

05:16.099 --> 05:17.234
Mm-hmm.

05:17.301 --> 05:18.971
Well, I've been doing it
a long time.

05:28.858 --> 05:31.797
<i>
I'm sorry for your loss.</i>

05:32.565 --> 05:34.268
That's what
normal people say, right?

05:34.335 --> 05:37.341
<i>How does it feel
for you to say it?</i>

05:37.407 --> 05:38.878
<i>
It just, um...</i>

05:39.679 --> 05:42.217
...just seems like
what I hear people say.

05:42.284 --> 05:43.720
But I mean it.

05:43.787 --> 05:46.593
Well, that is
the important part.

05:49.164 --> 05:50.434
<i>Gene, I wanted to ask you</i>

05:50.501 --> 05:52.070
about your sunglasses.

05:52.137 --> 05:54.241
I think it might be
a good idea for you

05:54.308 --> 05:56.479
to take them off, so we can see
each other better.

05:56.547 --> 05:57.548
I have eye problems.

05:57.615 --> 05:59.351
<i>
Oh, what's wrong?</i>

05:59.418 --> 06:00.854
<i>
Light hurts them.</i>

06:01.556 --> 06:03.192
They're oversensitive.

06:03.259 --> 06:05.230
You've seen a doctor about it?

06:05.297 --> 06:07.200
Two doctors.

06:16.587 --> 06:18.524
Well, we're out of time.

06:18.591 --> 06:20.494
Isn't that my line?

06:22.398 --> 06:25.170
I'm trying to take care
of your needs again, aren't I?

06:25.237 --> 06:27.207
I think so.

06:32.952 --> 06:34.488
He hit me.

06:35.490 --> 06:37.127
All the time.

06:37.193 --> 06:38.997
When you say "all the time,"

06:39.064 --> 06:42.438
could you be any more
specific about it?

06:42.505 --> 06:44.441
Pretty much all the time.

08:05.538 --> 08:07.842
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

08:07.908 --> 08:10.180
- Alan, welcome.
- Chaim, how are you?

08:10.247 --> 08:11.281
Baruch Hashem.

08:11.348 --> 08:13.687
- You?
- I'm well, thanks.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.027
- I'll be in the back.
- Oh.

08:17.093 --> 08:18.664
Okay.

08:18.730 --> 08:21.235
- Hi, Ezra.
- Hi, Dad.

08:22.371 --> 08:24.308
It's Mom's guitar?

08:24.375 --> 08:25.511
Mm-hmm.

08:25.578 --> 08:27.314
I figured you should have it.

08:27.381 --> 08:30.153
You're the only one
in the family who plays, so...

08:33.660 --> 08:36.098
I don't play anymore.

08:38.971 --> 08:42.979
<i>That's it, 'cause you'd expect
anybody to save their own ass,</i>

08:43.046 --> 08:46.452
but he'd rather die
than use her as his excuse,

08:46.519 --> 08:48.624
- like, uh, disgrace her.
- I think

08:48.691 --> 08:50.293
I have actually heard
that one before.

08:50.359 --> 08:52.430
Right, it's a classic.

08:59.746 --> 09:01.550
You know, Gene,
I've been thinking.

09:01.617 --> 09:03.353
It's been a while

09:03.420 --> 09:05.123
since we started
talking together.

09:05.190 --> 09:08.129
And I've noticed that...

09:09.164 --> 09:13.607
...you're not really
opening yourself up to me.

09:13.674 --> 09:16.913
Whenever I ask
for stories or details,

09:16.980 --> 09:19.919
you have a tendency
to get kind of vague

09:19.986 --> 09:21.222
or you start telling me

09:21.289 --> 09:24.495
about country music songs
that you like.

09:24.563 --> 09:29.071
And I've noticed
that I myself am feeling

09:29.137 --> 09:31.744
a little frustrated
by this process.

09:32.512 --> 09:35.149
And I'm wondering
if you're feeling that as well.

09:36.185 --> 09:39.659
Usually when one person feels
that way, it's kind of mutual.

09:42.264 --> 09:43.399
I don't know.

09:44.234 --> 09:47.976
I guess it's not working
the way it did in your book.

09:48.042 --> 09:51.048
Gene, in order
for this process to work,

09:51.115 --> 09:53.720
you have to be able
to tell me things

09:53.787 --> 09:56.325
that are not easy to tell.

09:57.394 --> 10:01.001
To be open and truthful.

10:03.774 --> 10:05.811
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

10:07.748 --> 10:10.921
'Cause I'm... I'm trying.

10:11.756 --> 10:14.261
I really-- I'm trying.

10:15.998 --> 10:17.968
In my experience...

10:19.004 --> 10:20.407
...anyone who has come this far,

10:20.473 --> 10:24.047
who has made the choice
to come to therapy

10:24.114 --> 10:28.122
and keep hammering away
at the hard things...

10:29.592 --> 10:31.228
...they can be helped.

12:49.739 --> 12:52.477
I'm so sorry. I know this sucks.

12:52.545 --> 12:54.080
I'll be right back.

13:08.944 --> 13:11.148
Gene, what the hell's going on?

13:11.215 --> 13:13.553
I mean, what the fuck?!

13:13.620 --> 13:16.291
Let me out, let me out,
let me out of here.

13:16.358 --> 13:18.596
Let me out of here
right now, Gene!

13:18.663 --> 13:21.201
- Gene!
- You take it easy.

13:23.172 --> 13:25.109
Last night you were screaming.

13:25.176 --> 13:28.215
We're in the woods out here.
Nobody's around.

13:32.725 --> 13:34.562
I know how upset you are.

13:34.628 --> 13:36.298
Of course. Anybody would be.

13:36.365 --> 13:38.536
This isn't as bad as it seems.

13:40.741 --> 13:44.615
It's bad, I know it's bad, but
I just, I just need your help.

13:44.682 --> 13:45.751
Look...

13:46.753 --> 13:49.525
I don't know what you think
you're doing, but this...

13:49.592 --> 13:50.994
this...

13:51.061 --> 13:52.932
Unlock this goddamn chain.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.136
Right now. I mean it, Gene.

13:56.072 --> 13:57.908
Gene, listen,
you have to listen to me.

13:58.743 --> 14:00.446
I realize that there's
something inside of you

14:00.514 --> 14:02.317
that's telling you
that this is a good idea...

14:02.383 --> 14:04.822
I know, it's-it's not exactly
that it's a good idea,

14:04.889 --> 14:06.091
I do realize that.

14:06.158 --> 14:08.095
But, you know,
I'm out of options,

14:08.162 --> 14:10.266
and I really think
if we can just talk,

14:10.333 --> 14:12.437
this will, this will be okay.

14:12.505 --> 14:14.508
- Okay-ish.
- I have to help you see

14:14.575 --> 14:16.311
that this is wrong.

14:17.347 --> 14:18.984
Scaring me like this is wrong.

14:19.051 --> 14:20.954
You have to see that.
I know you can see that.

14:21.021 --> 14:22.457
I do, I do, I know,

14:22.525 --> 14:26.967
but... I wasn't getting
anywhere in therapy.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.138
You said so yourself, right?

14:29.204 --> 14:30.574
And I think that I know why.

14:30.641 --> 14:32.210
You see, I-I couldn't...

14:32.276 --> 14:34.949
I couldn't really tell you
the truth in your office.

14:35.016 --> 14:36.753
But here, here... I can.

14:36.820 --> 14:38.156
No, no, no, no, no.

14:38.222 --> 14:39.892
This-this-this isn't good
for either of us, Gene.

14:39.959 --> 14:43.834
We have to go back to my office
and work through this together

14:43.901 --> 14:45.436
before this gets
more out of hand.

14:45.504 --> 14:48.844
These are leftovers from Maruti,
which is one of my favorites.

14:48.910 --> 14:50.647
It's surprisingly good
for breakfast.

14:50.714 --> 14:52.217
This is chana palak.

14:52.284 --> 14:53.419
Put some of this on it.

14:53.485 --> 14:56.091
This is sabzi.
It's good with this one.

14:56.157 --> 14:58.062
For God's sake, Gene, Gene!

14:58.129 --> 14:59.397
My name's...

15:00.801 --> 15:02.938
My name's actually Sam.

15:07.413 --> 15:08.583
Sorry.

15:11.823 --> 15:13.960
It's important to eat.

15:14.729 --> 15:16.566
I'm not gonna eat.

15:16.633 --> 15:18.368
Gene-- Sam.

15:20.072 --> 15:22.477
You have to listen to me.

15:22.544 --> 15:23.613
I am listening.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.685
I am listening.
I know how to listen.

15:25.751 --> 15:27.487
I understand...

15:28.256 --> 15:30.360
...this is upsetting for you.

15:30.427 --> 15:31.194
I get that.

15:31.261 --> 15:33.399
It's a little scary,

15:33.465 --> 15:36.204
but this is the only way
that I could... I...

15:37.641 --> 15:39.411
I need help. I want help.

15:39.478 --> 15:42.585
I'm asking you for, for help.

15:42.652 --> 15:44.889
You said therapy can't work
if I'm not truthful.

15:44.956 --> 15:46.091
I know that you're right, so...

15:46.158 --> 15:47.928
Mm-mm. No.
No, you don't understand.

15:47.995 --> 15:50.534
I don't, I don't think you know
what you're doing to me.

15:50.600 --> 15:52.404
I realize it might take you
a little time

15:52.470 --> 15:53.673
to get used
to what's happening here.

15:53.740 --> 15:55.176
Whatever is troubling you,

15:55.242 --> 15:57.548
we can address it, but not here.

15:57.615 --> 15:59.753
- Not like this.
- Dr. Strauss, I have much bigger problems

15:59.819 --> 16:01.321
than your other patients.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.564
I have a compulsion...

16:07.334 --> 16:09.103
...to kill people.

16:14.147 --> 16:16.017
A compulsion?

16:18.089 --> 16:19.558
Yeah, I do it.

16:25.571 --> 16:28.475
- Sam...
- I don't mean just once or twice.

16:29.812 --> 16:32.016
Every once in a while I just...

16:32.884 --> 16:34.320
...do it.

16:36.759 --> 16:38.830
And this has gone on ever since,

16:38.897 --> 16:41.669
uh, for a long time.

16:42.436 --> 16:44.942
And I know I'm fucked up.

16:45.009 --> 16:46.980
I've read all the books,

16:47.046 --> 16:50.153
almost everything about,
uh, people like me,

16:50.220 --> 16:52.658
people who do this stuff,
and I can't...

16:55.697 --> 16:57.167
I want to stop.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.939
And I'm trying so hard.

17:00.006 --> 17:01.542
I'm trying so hard right now,

17:01.609 --> 17:03.246
but there's this guy,
there's this one guy,

17:03.312 --> 17:04.715
and I just want to...

17:04.782 --> 17:07.119
for months now...

17:07.988 --> 17:09.490
Uh, but I've not done it.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.596
'Cause I...

17:13.332 --> 17:14.636
Uh, because I can't.

17:14.702 --> 17:15.704
Now, you, I wish you knew

17:15.771 --> 17:17.340
what it was like
to live like this.

17:17.406 --> 17:19.111
It's not like what they say.

17:19.177 --> 17:20.748
Right? Where he's like a...

17:21.516 --> 17:23.486
Have you seen
<i>Silence of the Lambs?</i>

17:23.554 --> 17:26.124
Where he's like a robot.

17:26.191 --> 17:27.628
It's not like that.

17:29.464 --> 17:30.199
Gene.

17:30.266 --> 17:33.238
- Sam.
- Sam.

17:35.009 --> 17:36.579
Unlock this chain.

17:36.646 --> 17:39.150
I'm going to walk out of here
and go back to my office.

17:39.217 --> 17:40.787
No, we already tried that.

17:40.854 --> 17:42.657
It didn't work without me
telling you the truth.

17:42.724 --> 17:44.862
It will be different
now that I know the truth.

17:44.929 --> 17:47.935
You will come to my office
two, three days a week.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.006
I cannot help you like this.

17:50.072 --> 17:51.842
This is just going
to make it worse.

17:52.778 --> 17:53.747
Let me go.

17:53.813 --> 17:55.182
I know you'd have to turn me in.

17:55.249 --> 17:58.488
No, no, no, no, no.
I would not have to turn you in.

17:59.224 --> 18:00.828
Legally, ethically,

18:00.894 --> 18:03.666
unless you told me you were
going to commit another crime,

18:03.733 --> 18:05.269
I can work with you.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.775
Everything you've told me
so far is confidential.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.845
I am gonna commit another crime.

18:16.826 --> 18:18.930
I know I'm not normal.

18:18.997 --> 18:20.867
But I don't feel crazy.

18:21.836 --> 18:23.105
I'm not...

18:24.976 --> 18:27.447
I know this has to end, right?
This has to stop.

18:27.514 --> 18:30.452
I just, I don't know how.
