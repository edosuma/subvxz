00:18.900 --> 00:21.300
- Mr. Moon?
- You again.

00:21.600 --> 00:23.500
Didn't I toss you
out of here last night?

00:23.800 --> 00:25.800
Six times. But if you'll
just give me a minute to...

00:26.000 --> 00:29.100
Gentlemen, this lad has travelled
all the way from America

00:29.500 --> 00:31.500
to reunite me with my wife.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.500
[ANGRY SHOUTING]

00:35.600 --> 00:36.800
NILES:
Wait, wait, wait!

00:37.100 --> 00:39.600
You never gave me a chance
to buy a round of drinks.

00:39.800 --> 00:41.800
[CHEERING]

00:43.800 --> 00:46.500
All right. The usual, Ray.

00:46.800 --> 00:49.300
Starting talking. You got one pint.

00:49.600 --> 00:52.800
Mr. Moon, a great man once wrote

00:53.200 --> 00:56.900
that the opposite of love
is not hate, but indifference.

00:57.200 --> 00:59.200
Done. Get out.

00:59.500 --> 01:02.400
Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon, your wife...
Your wife is miserable without you.

01:02.700 --> 01:05.600
You should give her another chance.
After all, you were married 40 years.

01:05.900 --> 01:10.000
Forty years too long. Now,
if you'll excuse me, I'm late for work.

01:12.800 --> 01:18.000
Hello. Aren't you a pretty thing?
Fancy a roll in the hay?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.000
Nobody talks
to my woman that way.

01:21.200 --> 01:22.400
[GRUNTING]

01:22.600 --> 01:25.200
Let's go.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.200
[GROANING]

01:29.200 --> 01:31.200
Here's a tenner, Harry.
Hope I didn't hurt you.

01:31.500 --> 01:33.100
All in the line of duty.
Good luck to you.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.100
- She's a nice bit of skirt.
- Ta.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.800
Same again, Ray.

01:43.500 --> 01:46.200
- Ooph.
- What was that?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.400
My job.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.300
I let lads give me a thumping
to impress their dates.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.200
I tell you, it's a cakewalk compared
to being married to Gertrude.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.900
At least when these lads hit me,
they hold something back.

01:58.100 --> 02:01.100
Well, you know, Mr. Moon,
you wouldn't recognise your wife.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.600
- She's mellowed.
- You're wasting your breath.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.900
All right,
forget about your wife for a minute.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.800
Think about your daughter.
She's heartbroken.

02:09.100 --> 02:10.900
- My Daphne?
- Yes! Yes.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.500
This separation
is tearing her apart. If...

02:13.800 --> 02:17.600
If you care about her, come back to
Seattle with me and talk to your wife.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.300
If you don't patch things up,

02:19.600 --> 02:22.100
at least your only daughter
will know you cared enough to try.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.300
Well, you know, I'd love
to see my baby girl again.

02:25.600 --> 02:28.600
But I can't afford to travel across
the Atlantic whenever I please.

02:28.900 --> 02:31.300
Oh, I would pay
for the ticket, of course.

02:31.700 --> 02:35.700
I can't have you buying me
a first-class ticket to America.

02:37.500 --> 02:40.200
- I insist.
- All right. For Daphne.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.700
You know, you're lucky you caught me
on a light workweek.

02:42.900 --> 02:46.300
Oh, here's my 2:00 now.

02:47.800 --> 02:52.700
Hello. Aren't you a pretty thing?

02:56.800 --> 02:59.000
- You mind if I join you, Roz?
- Oh, please.

02:59.200 --> 03:01.200
You can help me kill some time.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.700
Roger's picking up his things
from my apartment.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.200
- I don't want to run into him.
- Ah, afraid you'll fight?

03:06.500 --> 03:09.100
Worse. I'm afraid we'll end up in bed.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.600
There's something about him
that is irresistible.

03:13.900 --> 03:16.300
- I understand.
- Trust me, you don't.

03:16.500 --> 03:20.700
Roger is the best lover
I have ever been with.

03:22.800 --> 03:27.000
Oh, my God, what am I saying?
You were great, too.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.200
- There's no need to do this.
- It's just that I forgot.

03:30.400 --> 03:32.700
Well, technically, it wasn't really sex
because it was you.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.800
But whatever it was, it was great.

03:35.100 --> 03:37.400
Roz, please,
there's no need to discuss it.

03:37.600 --> 03:42.200
- I was one satisfied customer.
- Glad to hear it.

03:42.600 --> 03:45.300
Oh, here, let's pretend
that this comment card is about you.

03:45.500 --> 03:47.300
Roz, please, there is no need
to do that.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.000
Oh, all right, if you insist.

03:49.300 --> 03:50.800
Just remember
that it was late at night,

03:51.100 --> 03:53.600
and I am really
more of a morning person.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.900
There you go.

03:58.400 --> 03:59.400
Let's see.

03:59.500 --> 04:00.900
[ROZ CHUCKLES]

04:02.000 --> 04:04.100
High marks for courtesy
and neatness of appearance.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.000
- That's good.
- Mm-hm.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.000
You were served in a prompt
and timely manner.

04:09.300 --> 04:10.900
Absolutely.

04:11.100 --> 04:15.000
Now, I see here that, um,
you're not planning a return visit.

04:15.400 --> 04:17.800
Well, only because we agreed.
I mean, as you can see,

04:18.100 --> 04:21.700
I will highly recommend you
to friends and family members.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.600
Well, that's very kind of you,
Roz. Thank you.

04:25.800 --> 04:27.400
Would you like me
to fill one out for you?

04:27.700 --> 04:32.200
No. I think you made your opinion clear
when you screamed, "Outstanding."

04:37.300 --> 04:38.500
Oh.

04:38.600 --> 04:40.400
Well, thanks for a tour
of your city, lads.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.400
- Now where's your loo?
- Ah.

04:42.700 --> 04:46.200
I need to splash my boots. Oh.

04:47.100 --> 04:50.000
Just an expression.
Or so I've chosen to believe.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.900
Niles, are you and Daphne
planning on having children?

04:58.200 --> 05:01.500
- Someday. Why?
- No reason.

05:03.400 --> 05:07.900
Now, all I have to do
is stash Mr. Moon at my place,

05:08.200 --> 05:10.600
pick up Daphne
and her mom at the airport.

05:10.900 --> 05:15.200
Then get them all together and lay
the groundwork for a reconciliation.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.700
- Oh, hi, Dad. How was work?
- Hi, guys.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.200
Oh, great. I finally busted that guy

05:21.500 --> 05:24.700
who was writing "Seymour Butz"
on the sign-out sheets.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.600
- So who was it?
- Senior Vice-President Butz.

05:30.000 --> 05:32.100
I'm on probation for a week.

05:37.500 --> 05:41.100
Good God.
You American police are persistent.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.500
I suppose you'd be looking for this.

05:43.800 --> 05:46.900
- A Space Needle snow globe?
- You see, I meant to pay for it.

05:47.300 --> 05:50.000
I put it in my pocket, and somewhere
between there and the register,

05:50.300 --> 05:52.800
I forgot about it.
Why don't you take it back?

05:53.000 --> 05:54.400
Mr. Moon, I think you're mistaken.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.800
This is our father. He...
He works as a security guard.

05:57.100 --> 06:00.700
- Yeah, Marty Crane. How do you do?
- Oh, ha, ha. Harold Moon.

06:00.900 --> 06:04.100
Oh, well, you did a terrific job
bringing up your daughter.

06:04.500 --> 06:05.900
Oh, well, you know,
you do your best.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.500
[LAUGHS]

06:07.700 --> 06:10.000
- I'll be needing that back then.
- Oh.

06:10.900 --> 06:14.200
- Harry, let me get you a beer.
- Oh, get a man a beer,

06:14.500 --> 06:16.200
he'll drink for five minutes.

06:16.500 --> 06:20.400
Teach him where they are,
he drinks all day.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.000
Oh, uh, Dad, Dad,
I need you to do me a favour.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.200
Mr. Moon is a bit reluctant about
getting back together with his wife.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.500
Ha. Can you blame him?

06:29.800 --> 06:32.600
It occurs to me
that there's no woman so attractive

06:32.900 --> 06:35.500
as the one that some other guy
seems to be attracted to.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.800
- So...
- No way.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.600
[NILES STAMMERS]

06:38.900 --> 06:40.400
It would mean a lot to Daphne.

06:40.600 --> 06:43.100
And... And it'll get Mrs. Moon
out of the country.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.900
Well, if it means a lot to Daphne.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.100
Well, she's a hell of a woman,
your Gertrude.

06:51.400 --> 06:53.900
I don't blame you for coming over here
to fight for her.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.800
Really?

06:56.800 --> 07:00.100
- What's so great about her?
- Oh, well, you know, ha, ha.

07:00.400 --> 07:03.600
I mean, uh, like I have to tell you.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.900
The whole package, heh.
She's got, uh...

07:08.100 --> 07:10.300
...hair.

07:10.600 --> 07:13.200
Skin, uh, et cetera.

07:13.600 --> 07:17.300
- And she's a good little drinker.
- Dad, dad, dad. Why, just last week,

07:17.500 --> 07:21.900
you were commenting on her
twinkly eyes and her sunny smile.

07:22.300 --> 07:24.700
Definitely. Yes, I was. Ha, ha.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.900
Yeah, they sure don't make women
like that in America. Come on, boy.

07:30.200 --> 07:34.300
Wait a minute.
I think I know what's going on here.

07:34.700 --> 07:37.700
The dog, the cane.

07:39.400 --> 07:42.100
He's lost his vision, hasn't he?

07:47.900 --> 07:51.000
And then she drags me
to another luau.

07:51.300 --> 07:54.500
Where I come from, you bury
a dead pig because it's diseased,

07:54.900 --> 07:56.900
not because
you're gonna dig it up and eat it.

07:58.100 --> 08:00.200
Yes, well, Hawaii's not for everyone.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.400
Things may be looking up.
I have a surprise.

08:04.800 --> 08:06.900
Oh, a surprise.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.500
I hope not another trip, darling,

08:08.700 --> 08:11.200
or I might just have
to kill you in your sleep.

08:11.600 --> 08:14.500
Niles, good news.
Our feet are the same size.

08:14.800 --> 08:18.500
- Daddy. I knew you'd come!
- Hello, Stilts.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.400
Oh, give your old dad a kiss.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.000
[LAUGHING AND KISSING]

08:23.300 --> 08:26.000
Mum, look who's here,
all the way from England.

08:26.400 --> 08:27.900
Hello, Gert.

08:28.700 --> 08:33.200
"Hello, Gert"? That's all
you have to say for yourself?

08:33.600 --> 08:35.600
For 40 years
I've been a good wife to you,

08:35.900 --> 08:38.400
raising your children
and boiling your meals,

08:38.700 --> 08:40.900
and letting you work off
your animal lusts,

08:41.200 --> 08:44.500
and all I get for my trouble
is a cheery, "Hello, Gert"?

08:44.800 --> 08:47.400
Well, your fatal charm
is not gonna work this time.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.700
So you can drag your sorry ass back
to that barstool it normally sags over

08:52.000 --> 08:53.600
and leave me the hell alone!

08:56.400 --> 08:58.700
Thank you, Niles,
that was a nice surprise.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.900
You're right. She has mellowed.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.400
See? And I'm... I'm sure
if you just give her a little more time,

09:09.700 --> 09:12.500
- you'll work everything out.
- I gave it my best shot.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.600
- I'm gonna go pack.
- Daddy.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.900
I don't understand. He came all this
way and he's just gonna give up?

09:21.200 --> 09:24.300
Well, actually,
he didn't even want to come.

09:24.600 --> 09:29.100
I sort of flew to England
and persuaded him.

09:30.400 --> 09:33.800
- You what?
- I wanted to surprise you.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.400
How could you do this
without talking to me first?

09:38.200 --> 09:39.900
That would've ruined the surprise.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.300
Niles, I could have flown
to England and talked to him too.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.900
But I didn't
because I know my parents.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.500
When they fight, they need
time apart to miss each other.

09:48.800 --> 09:52.200
And you would have known that
had you consulted me first.

09:53.400 --> 09:57.000
HARRY: I'm off.
- Uh, Mr. Moon, Mr. Moon, wait.

09:57.300 --> 09:59.400
Just... Just... Just stay one more day

09:59.700 --> 10:03.100
and spend a little more time with
your daughter. I'll put you up in a hotel.

10:03.600 --> 10:07.600
I can't let you buy me a suite
in a five-star hotel.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.800
- I'm sorry I yelled at you last night.
- No, no, I'm sorry.

10:21.100 --> 10:23.400
L... I was thinking about it.
You were absolutely right.

10:23.700 --> 10:26.200
Look... We are a team now,
and bringing your dad back

10:26.600 --> 10:29.300
- should have been our joint decision.
- Thanks for understanding.

10:29.600 --> 10:31.600
Anyway, what's done is done.

10:31.900 --> 10:33.500
Mum's taken her claws
out of the ceiling,

10:33.700 --> 10:35.000
and Dad's headed back to England.

10:35.200 --> 10:37.800
Actually, I convinced him
to stay another day.

10:38.000 --> 10:39.900
I thought I should tell you
since we're a team.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.900
- You what?
- Well, I thought you'd wanna

10:43.100 --> 10:44.500
spend more time with him. Plus,

10:44.800 --> 10:47.500
since they're both in the same city,
we can get them together tonight.

10:48.300 --> 10:49.900
Or not.

10:50.100 --> 10:52.200
We're a team.

10:52.400 --> 10:54.400
It's totally up to you.

10:55.200 --> 10:58.400
I don't know. Maybe we should
let them work it out for themselves.

10:58.800 --> 11:02.000
Yeah. Or, on the other hand,
maybe our love will inspire them,

11:02.300 --> 11:05.600
and come October,
they'll be dancing at our wedding.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.200
- That would be wonderful.
- Oh, hi, guys.

11:08.500 --> 11:10.900
Hey, Frasier. Frasier, listen. Uh...

11:11.100 --> 11:13.300
Daphne and I are taking her parents
out to dinner tonight.

11:13.700 --> 11:15.300
Can you get us a reservation
at Chez Henri?

11:15.600 --> 11:16.900
Oh, Chez Henri.

11:17.200 --> 11:18.800
Niles, they're booked up
months in advance.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.700
I know that I wouldn't get in,
but I was hoping if I cloaked myself

11:22.000 --> 11:24.400
- in the mantle of your renown...
- You know better than that.

11:24.700 --> 11:26.800
Niles, I am not susceptible to flattery.

11:27.100 --> 11:29.500
I know. You're the most grounded,
down-to-earth person I know.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.700
Thank you. I'll make a call.

11:32.900 --> 11:35.600
- Hey, Daphne, Niles. Frasier.
- Oh! Roz, Roz.

11:35.900 --> 11:39.800
Uh, listen,
I wanted to talk to you about this.

11:40.200 --> 11:46.000
- Oh, my God. You still have that?
- Yes, well, I was glancing at it.

11:46.800 --> 11:51.400
I couldn't help but notice
that the overall score you gave me,

11:51.800 --> 11:55.900
out of a possible five cups of coffee,

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
was a four.

11:58.600 --> 12:01.200
- Yeah. That's a good score.
- It's... It's a fine score.

12:01.500 --> 12:03.800
But it occurs to me that this presents
an opportunity for me

12:04.100 --> 12:08.400
to learn something about my
performance that might benefit me.

12:08.800 --> 12:11.200
So, what might I have done

12:11.800 --> 12:15.100
to earn that elusive fifth cup?

12:16.700 --> 12:19.700
Oh, I'm a tough grader.
No one's a five-cupper.

12:20.100 --> 12:25.500
Nevertheless, there is a theoretical
fifth cup out there.

12:25.900 --> 12:29.900
Now, I'm going to put ego aside.
This is strictly about self-improvement.

12:30.200 --> 12:34.400
My commitment to sexcellence,
if you will.

12:35.600 --> 12:38.600
- You just lost a cup.
- Oh, please, Roz.

12:40.300 --> 12:42.500
All right. Um...

12:42.800 --> 12:44.600
[CHUCKLES]

12:45.500 --> 12:47.500
You know that thing
you did at the end?

12:47.800 --> 12:50.700
- At the very end?
- Just before.

12:50.900 --> 12:54.600
- I know exactly what you mean.
- I could have done without that.

12:56.800 --> 12:58.400
Really?

12:58.700 --> 13:01.700
You didn't like that? Hm.
Well, maybe that's just your taste.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.400
- No.
- Oh.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.100
Because I've received high kudos
for that in the past.

13:06.400 --> 13:07.900
No, look, don't take it personally.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.100
It would have been impossible
for either one of us

13:10.400 --> 13:12.800
to get a perfect score that night,
given the circumstances.

13:13.100 --> 13:16.300
We were both tentative,
more than a little vulnerable.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.100
- That's true.
- And it was tough to concentrate

13:19.400 --> 13:22.400
with the TV blaring away
in your dad's bedroom.

13:23.300 --> 13:24.600
I didn't hear that.

13:24.900 --> 13:27.900
Don't you remember?
Sting was on Letterman.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.800
He was talking about the rain forest

13:33.000 --> 13:35.100
and the plight
of the Yanomama Indians.

13:36.700 --> 13:38.300
It was really sad.

13:38.600 --> 13:42.300
I mean, the whole Orinoco River Valley
is being forested into extinction.

13:44.600 --> 13:49.400
Well, I'm glad
my woefully inadequate performance

13:49.800 --> 13:52.400
didn't distract you
from your ecology lesson.

13:53.600 --> 13:56.700
Did Sting happen to mention anything
about you shaving your legs?

13:59.300 --> 14:01.500
Because that's a rain forest
that could use some pruning.

14:01.800 --> 14:02.900
Frasier!

14:03.100 --> 14:06.400
That is exactly why I didn't want to do...
Forget it.

14:06.700 --> 14:08.700
Forget it.

14:15.600 --> 14:18.700
- You know, you're a very good kisser.
- No, I'm not.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.400
- You are. I'm not.
- Oh, yes, you are.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.000
- Do I need to fill out another card?
- Oh, please.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.200
Would you?

14:30.500 --> 14:32.300
[LAUGHS]

14:33.000 --> 14:35.400
We have some
magnificent specials this evening.

14:35.700 --> 14:40.000
Just so you know, Henri,
I won't eat frogs, snails, slugs or eels.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.800
And don't try slipping them
under the sauce. I'm on to you people.

14:45.000 --> 14:47.200
I shall, uh, repeat this to the chef,

14:47.500 --> 14:49.600
and I'm sure some other
delightful surprise

14:49.900 --> 14:52.400
will find its way onto your plate.

14:54.300 --> 14:58.300
Isn't this lovely?
Candlelight, romantic music.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.100
Ah. It must take you back
to the days of your courtship.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.800
- Where did you two meet?
- At a soccer riot.

15:05.100 --> 15:07.800
She stopped a Spanish bloke
from smashing a chair over my head.

15:08.100 --> 15:11.000
He wasn't Spanish,
he was Portuguese.

15:11.400 --> 15:14.400
- I believe he was Spanish.
- Well, I believe I know the difference

15:14.700 --> 15:16.700
between a bloody Spaniard
and a bloody Portuguese.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.800
Oh, okay. Okay, moving on. Um...

15:21.200 --> 15:23.900
- Your first date?
- She had me over for dinner.

15:24.200 --> 15:27.300
Oh, do you remember,
I cooked you bubble and squeak.

15:27.600 --> 15:30.800
And then we went out,
got squiffy and half-starkers,

15:31.200 --> 15:32.600
and snogged behind the chippy.

15:32.900 --> 15:34.900
[ALL LAUGH]

15:35.200 --> 15:39.500
You lost me after the word "dinner,"
but the language of love is universal.

15:41.700 --> 15:43.600
Oh, listen, we had
some good times back then, eh?

15:43.900 --> 15:45.900
Oh, you should have
seen her, Daphne.

15:46.200 --> 15:48.700
- She was a real firecracker.
- Oh.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.200
Maybe we should
order some champagne.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.600
I brought a very special bottle.
It's in the car.

15:54.900 --> 15:59.300
Um, you two, you just, uh,
keep reminiscing. I'll be right back.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.700
Hello, lovely dog.

16:07.900 --> 16:09.400
Hey, hey, hey.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.500
- Hello.
- Hello.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.600
[CAR ALARM BEEPS]

16:18.900 --> 16:21.200
- Bastard. Take that back.
- I will not.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.400
- Mommy, Daddy, please.
- What's going on?

16:23.700 --> 16:26.600
What happened
to snogging behind the chippy?

16:26.800 --> 16:29.700
- Get out of my country.
- I can't leave soon enough.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.100
[GROANS]

16:31.400 --> 16:34.100
- You're Martin Crane's problem now.
- What?

16:34.400 --> 16:36.700
Did you think I wouldn't find out
about your old fancy man?

16:37.000 --> 16:39.400
- He can't stop thinking about you.
- That's because he knows

16:39.700 --> 16:43.000
- a good thing when he sees it.
- He can't see anything!

16:44.000 --> 16:47.100
Take me home, Daphne.
I've had enough of this horrid man.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.700
Oh, wait. Now that the lines
of communication are open...

16:50.000 --> 16:51.900
Oh, leave it alone, Niles.
Come on, Mum.

16:55.600 --> 16:59.300
No, Gertrude, I never said
I had a thing for you.

16:59.700 --> 17:02.700
No, I'm not playing hard to get.

17:03.000 --> 17:07.900
Yes, I guess if I was playing hard
to get I'd say that I wasn't, but I'm not.

17:08.800 --> 17:14.500
Henri, you... You can't ban me
from your bistro.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
It's my chez away from chez.

17:18.300 --> 17:19.800
But...

17:20.900 --> 17:24.700
- Very well. Goodbye, Henri.
- Goodbye, Gertrude.

17:25.000 --> 17:26.000
[DOORBELL RINGS]

17:26.300 --> 17:30.500
Great. I cheated death in Korea
for this.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.500
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.100
- I see word travels fast.
- Is Daphne here?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.300
No, she's not back
from taking her mother home yet.

17:40.600 --> 17:43.400
Oh, well, I was hoping
to see her before I left.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.300
- I guess I'll leave her a note then.
- Uh, Mr. Moon.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.700
I'm sorry I dragged you
all the way to America.

17:49.000 --> 17:53.900
Oh, it wasn't all that bad. I got to see
Daphne. And that hotel was brilliant.

17:54.600 --> 17:58.400
The towels were so fluffy,
I could barely close my suitcase.

18:02.400 --> 18:06.900
- Niles, I'm sorry things didn't work out.
- Well, we can't say you didn't try.

18:08.700 --> 18:11.900
- Hello.
- Hello.

18:12.900 --> 18:16.200
Well, uh, Dad, uh, why don't we
go to your bedroom?

18:16.600 --> 18:18.900
I wanna show you how to use
your closed captioning on the TV

18:19.200 --> 18:21.100
so you don't have to have it on
so loud at night.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.200
Yeah, sure.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.500
Your dad's here in your room.
He's just leaving you a note.

18:26.800 --> 18:28.400
How's your mom?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.600
Apparently there's nothing
left for her in England,

18:30.800 --> 18:33.900
so she's thinking
about putting down roots here.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.700
Daphne,
from the bottom of my heart...

18:36.900 --> 18:41.000
Niles, it's been a very trying day.
Could we talk about this later?

18:41.400 --> 18:45.700
I'll drive Daddy to the airport.
I'll move his suitcase to your car.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.900
There you are.
Well, back to England then.

18:50.300 --> 18:53.500
Yes. No chance of you and Mum
getting back together?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.900
Don't think so, love. Not this time.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.000
- Maybe if you give it another chance.
- Daphne, I'm sorry. It's over.

19:01.400 --> 19:05.500
Has been for a long time.
I mean, I've got no complaints.

19:05.800 --> 19:08.400
I got something
wonderful out of it. You.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.000
[LAUGHS]

19:10.300 --> 19:13.600
Oh, Dad.
If you didn't love each other,

19:13.900 --> 19:16.200
why did you stay together
for 40 years?

19:16.400 --> 19:19.200
Through all the fighting
and the screaming and the hitting?

19:19.500 --> 19:21.300
That was for you kids.

19:23.200 --> 19:25.400
I can't believe this is really happening.

19:25.700 --> 19:29.000
Maybe I'm naive, but I always
thought love would save the day.

19:29.400 --> 19:31.400
Well, you know, we all think
that when we're young,

19:31.700 --> 19:33.300
but then life beats us around a bit

19:33.400 --> 19:35.900
and you learn to dream
a little smaller.

19:36.200 --> 19:39.200
So that's how it goes.
Two people get married,

19:39.500 --> 19:42.800
they're together 40 years,
and then all of a sudden it just ends.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.800
But it's different for you.
I mean, you've found the right person.

19:47.200 --> 19:49.300
- You barely know him.
- Well, all I know is

19:49.600 --> 19:52.300
I threw him out of my pub six times,
and six times he marched back in

19:52.600 --> 19:54.000
and yammered my ear off until...

19:54.300 --> 19:55.900
Until I went back with him
to America.

19:56.200 --> 20:00.800
All to make you happy. I never
did anything like that for your mother.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.300
No, no. I tell you, Daphne,
you've got a right one there,

20:04.500 --> 20:08.400
A good one, you know. And another
thing, he's worth a bob or two.

20:09.300 --> 20:11.100
- Oh, Dad.
- Ha, ha, sweetie.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.000
[LAUGHS]

20:13.600 --> 20:14.800
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

20:16.900 --> 20:19.300
- I want to marry you.
- I want to marry you.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.000
No, I want to marry you now.

20:22.300 --> 20:24.500
- As in now?
- Yes.

20:25.000 --> 20:27.300
- Why?
- Why?

20:27.500 --> 20:30.100
Because you'd do anything,

20:30.400 --> 20:34.000
even put up with my insane family,
to make me happy.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.400
Because you'd travel
halfway around the world

20:36.700 --> 20:40.500
to make my dreams come true,
even the impossible ones.

20:40.800 --> 20:43.400
And because
I can't spend one more second

20:43.800 --> 20:46.400
without being your wife, Niles Crane,

20:46.700 --> 20:48.300
because I adore you.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.800

wanted a big wedding.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.300
You want to make
my dreams come true?
