00:03.636 --> 00:06.239

Let's meet

[announcer] <i> Nude canvases</i>
<i>heated up the flash challenge.</i>

00:12.078 --> 00:13.246
I refuse to tattoo

00:13.313 --> 00:15.181
with a penis
laying beside my face.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.183
I feel offended.

00:17.250 --> 00:19.386
[announcer] <i> And Scott proved</i>
<i>he isn't afraid to</i>

00:19.452 --> 00:22.188
<i>-to play the game.</i>
-No one is getting

00:22.255 --> 00:23.690
-the easy route.
-It's a ton of work.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.924
You didn't like
the one I gave you?

00:24.991 --> 00:26.626
Scott's screwing over
a lot of people.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.662
-I'm trying to win, man.
-You just know you're a dick.

00:29.729 --> 00:32.165
[announcer]
<i>In the elimination tattoo,</i>

00:32.232 --> 00:35.668
<i>Scott's cutthroat strategy</i>
<i>sank his competition.</i>

00:35.735 --> 00:36.770
Whoo!

00:36.836 --> 00:38.171
You think
I did a bad tattoo?

00:38.238 --> 00:41.408
Whether you send me down or not,
I'm not ready to leave.

00:42.909 --> 00:45.111
[announcer]
<i>In an explosive elimination,</i>

00:45.178 --> 00:48.415
<i>Randy, Bubba, and Roland</i>
<i>were the bottom three.</i>

00:48.481 --> 00:50.150
Randy.
This thing is rough.

00:50.216 --> 00:52.819
This looks like
a crayola scribble, very weak.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.388
As a 30-year-old
homosexual, it--

00:55.455 --> 00:56.723
This isn't about
your sexual preference.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.158
-It is, be--
-It has nothing to do

00:58.224 --> 00:59.592
with history.
This has to do

00:59.659 --> 01:01.394
-what's on the screen.
-It does, Chris.

01:01.461 --> 01:02.595
It is not easy
to be openly gay--

01:02.662 --> 01:04.129
But, bro, listen--

01:04.197 --> 01:06.366
-In a male-dominated--
-You can be whatever you want.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.935
You're not gonna get bashed
for your sexual preference.

01:09.002 --> 01:12.639
You're only gonna get bashed
for the quality of your craft.

01:12.705 --> 01:15.809
Randy, you do not have
what it takes to be Ink Master.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.677
By the way, Nuñez, my boyfriend

01:17.744 --> 01:19.078
really didn't think
you were cute.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.949
[announcer]
<i>13 artists remain,</i>

01:23.016 --> 01:27.554

<i>and the title of</i>

01:30.223 --> 01:32.959
♪♪

02:27.213 --> 02:29.449
What the [bleep]'s wrong
with these judges?

02:29.516 --> 02:31.317
Those guys beat me down,
especially Nuñez.

02:31.384 --> 02:32.919
-It's mediocre tattooing.
-No.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.420
-I think I'm in the top five--
-With this?

02:34.487 --> 02:35.722
And I'm doing better
than last season.

02:35.788 --> 02:37.457
With this,
you're not in the top five.

02:37.524 --> 02:38.658
You're falling short, bud.

02:39.759 --> 02:40.927
Like, are you basically
telling me

02:40.994 --> 02:42.562
that there's no chance
that I have

02:42.629 --> 02:44.797
of winning this competition?
Isn't that some--

02:44.864 --> 02:47.634
"No, Kyle, you don't have it.
We know that you can't."

02:47.700 --> 02:48.768
You got to beat me up now?

02:48.835 --> 02:50.503
I designed
a kick-ass piece.

02:50.570 --> 02:52.605
I don't think so.

02:52.672 --> 02:53.606
From a distance,
it was hard to read,

02:53.673 --> 02:55.975
so I agree with them.

02:56.042 --> 02:57.977
You obviously don't know
what you're talking about.

02:58.044 --> 02:59.379
[Sausage] Why come back
and do it again?

02:59.445 --> 03:01.814
Why the [bleep]
wouldn't I be here?

03:01.881 --> 03:03.650
'Cause I have a chance
to win $100,000.

03:03.716 --> 03:05.285
I've given up
on impressing those judges.

03:05.351 --> 03:06.653
They are the bad guys.

03:06.719 --> 03:09.255
The judges, the judges,
the judges, good God.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.957
I'm just tired of hearing
all the [bleep] bitching.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.525
Every time somebody
comes up here, it's just like,

03:12.592 --> 03:14.127
"Well, it's my client,
and the judges suck,

03:14.193 --> 03:16.396
and they need to be
punched in the teeth."

03:16.462 --> 03:18.665
Let's just talk
about the damn tattoo.

03:31.077 --> 03:32.612
Welcome, artists.

03:32.679 --> 03:35.415
You survived another week,
but only one of you

03:35.481 --> 03:40.186
will walk away with $100,000
and the title of Ink Master.

03:40.253 --> 03:43.022
This week, we're testing a skill
that can take your tattoo

03:43.089 --> 03:45.825
from being average
to being a masterpiece.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.760
Technical precision.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.762
{\an8}Technical precision
is making sure

03:49.829 --> 03:51.664
{\an8}that all of your lines
and all of your shading

03:51.731 --> 03:53.132
are perfectly exact.

03:53.199 --> 03:55.435
Whoever is gonna have
an issue with this

03:55.501 --> 03:57.070
probably shouldn't
be here anyway.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.172
It all started
over 50 years ago

03:59.238 --> 04:00.540
with a comic book.

04:00.607 --> 04:02.542
Since then, there have been
six feature films

04:02.609 --> 04:06.312
grossing over $2.3 billion.

04:06.379 --> 04:08.648
I'm talking
about the X-Men.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.050
Oh, yeah.
[applause]

04:13.219 --> 04:14.487
Yes!

04:14.554 --> 04:16.522
{\an8}Yay! I'm super stoked.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.857
X-Men is my love.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.494
I easily have
300 to 400 X-Men comics.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.763
Each X-Men character
has a superpower

04:23.830 --> 04:25.832
caused by a mutation.

04:25.898 --> 04:28.835
Like the X-Men,
each of your canvases today

04:28.901 --> 04:31.170
also desires
a mutant superpower,

04:31.237 --> 04:34.273
and it's up to you
to grant it to them.

04:34.340 --> 04:36.943
For today's flash challenge,
you must create an image

04:37.010 --> 04:40.813
that represents the superpower
your canvas wants to have

04:40.880 --> 04:42.548
and then
tattoo them with it.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.951
{\an8}A mutant superpower
can be anything.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.919
Who knows
what these people want?

04:46.986 --> 04:48.354
Let's meet your canvases.

04:52.525 --> 04:55.862
Canvases, please tell us the
superpower that you would like.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.296
-Freezing time.
-Sonar power.

04:57.363 --> 04:59.632
I'd like a shield
to represent a force field.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.634
A realistic sun
to represent the ability

05:01.701 --> 05:03.002
to melt whatever I see.

05:03.069 --> 05:04.637
What?

05:04.704 --> 05:06.005
-Super strength.
-Flight.

05:06.072 --> 05:07.907
-Immortality.
-Clairvoyance.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.642
I want a raven
with The Eye of Horus

05:09.709 --> 05:11.077
to represent telepathy.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.680
-Weather control.
-Fire and ice manipulation.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.748
-Super speed.
-How do you tattoo

05:15.815 --> 05:18.317
{\an8}a superpower on somebody?
This sucks.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.953
Scott, you won
best tattoo of the day

05:21.020 --> 05:22.989
in the last elimination tattoo.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.692
You now have the power
to choose your own canvas

05:25.758 --> 05:27.293
for this flash challenge.

05:31.030 --> 05:35.535
I'll take telepathy,
The Raven and The Eye of Horus.

05:35.601 --> 05:38.905
The rest of the canvases
will one by one pick a skull

05:38.971 --> 05:40.440
with an artist's name on it.

05:40.506 --> 05:44.177
The canvas that draws
your name will be your client.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.012
Roland.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.680
Kyle.

05:47.747 --> 05:49.549
Halo.

05:49.615 --> 05:51.250
Jim.

05:51.317 --> 05:52.552
Bubba.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.253
King Ruck?

06:01.728 --> 06:04.430
Sausage?

06:04.497 --> 06:05.732
All right.

06:07.133 --> 06:08.701
He wants a realistic sun?

06:08.768 --> 06:10.069
{\an8}I don't know
how to make this

06:10.136 --> 06:12.972
{\an8}not look like
a big, red lollipop.

06:15.341 --> 06:16.609
Keith.

06:16.676 --> 06:18.144
Matti.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.645
Melissa.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.314
Lydia.

06:21.380 --> 06:23.082
Gentle Jay?

06:23.149 --> 06:25.418
You have three hours
to tattoo your canvas

06:25.485 --> 06:27.653
-with a superpower.
-[bleep]

06:27.720 --> 06:31.257
And your time starts now.

06:32.925 --> 06:34.527
When we're looking
for technical precision,

06:34.594 --> 06:37.363
{\an8}we want to see people
keep everything super tight.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.766
We're gonna be looking at
all the nitpicky little details

06:39.832 --> 06:41.267
to make sure
all the lines match up,

06:41.334 --> 06:42.435
all the color is solid,

06:42.502 --> 06:44.003
all the blends
are nice and smooth.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.938
I want the freaking, like,
ears to be pretty big,

06:46.005 --> 06:47.840
so that's gonna represent,
like, the sonar.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.509
So we're gonna do a sun

06:49.575 --> 06:51.244
-on your solar plexus.
-Yes.

06:51.310 --> 06:54.113
He wants a realistic sun in the
middle of his chest,

06:54.180 --> 06:56.582
{\an8}and I still have to figure out
how to make it a superpower.

06:56.649 --> 06:59.118
It might be kind of cool
if we did the sun at the top

06:59.185 --> 07:00.953
and then maybe we did
some concentric rings

07:01.020 --> 07:02.655
that kind of come down,
so maybe it looks like

07:02.722 --> 07:04.123
the sun is able
to melt anything.

07:04.190 --> 07:06.125
The only thing I can think
to show precision

07:06.192 --> 07:08.694
-is round circles.
-I'm more of a visual.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.229
If I can see it,
I can say yes or no.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.931
It's kind of hard for me
to draw 13 designs

07:11.998 --> 07:13.299
and have you go, like,
"Yeah, that's what I want."

07:19.038 --> 07:20.706
There's a lot of turmoil
inside of me.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.242
{\an8}I've got the judges in my head
telling me to do things one way.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.144
I've got myself in my head
trying to tell me

07:25.211 --> 07:26.779
how to do it another,
and at this point,

07:26.846 --> 07:30.483
I really need to give America
a reason why they voted me back.

07:30.550 --> 07:32.418
Don't move.

07:32.485 --> 07:35.788
Kyle's doing the shield
with the fleur-de-lis.

07:35.855 --> 07:36.989
{\an8}Whoopity-doo.

07:37.056 --> 07:38.291
When Kyle's
in his own element,

07:38.357 --> 07:39.992
he can knock tattoos
out of the park,

07:40.059 --> 07:44.163
but Kyle doesn't deal
with stress at [bleep] all.

07:44.230 --> 07:45.598
One hour left, everybody.

07:45.665 --> 07:47.366
One hour to go.

07:47.433 --> 07:49.569
I'm just gonna do
this simple tattoo

07:49.635 --> 07:51.237
{\an8}as clean as I possibly can.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.440
When it comes down to doing
a technically precise tattoo,

07:54.507 --> 07:56.008
the rule is K-I-S-S.

07:56.075 --> 07:57.910
"Keep it simple, stupid."

07:57.977 --> 07:59.011
Why don't you just go
really big

07:59.078 --> 08:00.346
on the middle of your back?

08:00.413 --> 08:02.081
I'm trying to get
this [bleep] done.

08:02.148 --> 08:03.449
I just don't want
to not finish.

08:03.516 --> 08:06.185
I have to do it big
to make it believable

08:06.252 --> 08:08.421
{\an8}that she would actually get
some sort of a power

08:08.487 --> 08:09.755
{\an8}to fly from these wings.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.824
This sucks.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.092
Ten more minutes.

08:16.596 --> 08:19.799
{\an8}My canvas wants cheetah spots
that convey super speed,

08:19.866 --> 08:22.034
{\an8}and I'm pissed.
Fur doesn't lend itself

08:22.101 --> 08:25.137
to being technically precise,
because it's fur.

08:29.141 --> 08:32.278
Five, four, three,

08:32.345 --> 08:34.313
two, one.

08:34.380 --> 08:35.847
Machines down.
Time's up.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.316
No more ink.

08:37.383 --> 08:38.918
Hang out.
Let me clean you up, all right?

08:38.985 --> 08:39.919
That looks pretty sick.

08:39.986 --> 08:41.053
-You like that?
-Yeah.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.222
Looks really realistic.

08:43.289 --> 08:45.691
{\an8}Roland's cheetah print
come out looking like

08:45.758 --> 08:47.994
{\an8}a melted piece of pizza.

08:48.060 --> 08:50.496
How can you screw up
cheetah print?

08:52.131 --> 08:55.234
Bubba, your technical
precision in this tattoo

08:55.301 --> 08:57.436
is some of the best
we've seen out of you.

08:57.503 --> 08:59.305
Your circle on the outside
is nice and solid.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.407
Your black is solid.
It's a nice job.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.642
Jim.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.678
It does look like
a logo for a superhero.

09:05.745 --> 09:07.847
My only complaint is that
for being a crystal ball,

09:07.914 --> 09:09.215
it's so dark.

09:09.282 --> 09:11.284
If it had a little bit
more shine on the edges,

09:11.350 --> 09:13.452
it would have been
a lot more recognizable.

09:13.519 --> 09:14.720
Halo.

09:14.787 --> 09:16.789
Lots of tiny details
in there to really show

09:16.856 --> 09:18.224
the technical precision,

09:18.291 --> 09:20.526
but it doesn't grasp
the comic book challenge.

09:20.593 --> 09:23.095
Halo did
a <i> Wizard of Oz</i> tattoo.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.830
I don't know what superpower
this is supposed to be.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.500
{\an8}He might as well have just drawn
Toto and The Yellow Brick Road

09:27.566 --> 09:29.802
-in there while he was at it.
-Lydia.

09:29.869 --> 09:31.237
The numbers look
a little simple,

09:31.304 --> 09:33.105
and you also have
a little white outline

09:33.172 --> 09:34.573
around the edge of the numbers.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.909
It looks like your precision
is a little bit off.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.110
Jay.

09:38.177 --> 09:39.412
This definitely
is a big tattoo

09:39.478 --> 09:40.680
for the amount of time.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.515
Some of your technical
precision suffered

09:42.581 --> 09:44.650
trying to rush to get
such a large tattoo done.

09:44.717 --> 09:47.253
Jay's a dumbass for thinking
that he's gonna do

09:47.320 --> 09:48.554
{\an8}pretty much
half a back piece.

09:50.389 --> 09:51.490
King Ruck.

09:51.557 --> 09:53.059
This is
a technical precision challenge,

09:53.125 --> 09:54.527
and you did come through

09:54.593 --> 09:56.896
with some very definitive
black areas and shading,

09:56.963 --> 09:58.998
-gave this thing some depth.
-Thank you.

09:59.065 --> 10:00.933
-Kyle.
-You did some nice,

10:01.000 --> 10:02.535
clean straight lines on the
outside.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.937
The only thing is to just
separate your gray values

10:05.004 --> 10:07.139
from the outside border
to the shield,

10:07.206 --> 10:08.774
give it a little more life.

10:08.841 --> 10:09.809
Keith.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.243
It rides the arm nicely.

10:11.310 --> 10:12.345
It's a nice,
clean outline.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.780
Clean shading.
Nice job.

10:14.847 --> 10:15.848
Melissa.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.116
Making the fire
so much smaller

10:17.183 --> 10:18.818
than the actual Zippo

10:18.884 --> 10:20.319
is the only place
that your tattoo

10:20.386 --> 10:22.621
-fell a little short.
-Scott.

10:22.688 --> 10:26.125
[Scott] She wanted to do a raven
with telekinetic energy.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.526
Super clean, beautiful tattoo,

10:27.593 --> 10:29.862
but it definitely
looks like a black eagle.

10:29.929 --> 10:32.331
It does not have
a raven or a crow beak.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.200
A technically precise raven

10:34.266 --> 10:35.901
{\an8}will not look like
a black eagle.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.503
If that thing has a curved beak,

10:37.570 --> 10:40.639
then it is definitely not
technically precise.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.376
-Sausage.
-It took technical precision

10:43.442 --> 10:45.144
to get those negative rings
in there,

10:45.211 --> 10:47.079
but from a distance,
it's really hard to tell

10:47.146 --> 10:49.181
what's going on
with this tattoo.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.683
Matti.
What is this, a hammer?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.185
It's based off Thor's hammer,
but I threw a little bit

10:53.252 --> 10:55.454
of that crazy,
X-Men magical power stuff

10:55.521 --> 10:57.023
-around the outside of it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, I see that.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.591
It definitely has
the comic book feel.

10:58.657 --> 11:00.793
And the clean lines, man,
that's what makes it stand out.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.395
Thank you.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.329
Roland.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.564
It is a loose, furry design.

11:05.631 --> 11:07.333
It would have been
a lot more understandable

11:07.400 --> 11:08.534
if you would have stuck more

11:08.601 --> 11:11.170
to the recognizable
circular spots.

11:11.237 --> 11:13.839
That took away from it.

11:13.906 --> 11:15.608
We're doing superpowers,

11:15.674 --> 11:17.443
and we're testing
technical precision.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.512
Let's talk a little bit
about the bottom of the field.

11:19.578 --> 11:21.580
Lydia with the stopwatch
on the foot.

11:21.647 --> 11:23.983
She had to re-outline
with white to hide

11:24.050 --> 11:26.218
how messed up
those numbers look.

11:26.285 --> 11:28.187
Roland's in the bottom.

11:28.254 --> 11:29.789
It was closer
to a flesh-eating disease

11:29.855 --> 11:31.490
than it was cheetah spots.

11:31.557 --> 11:33.492
-Jay.
-I hated those wings.

11:33.559 --> 11:35.694
It looks like
two ratty umbrellas.

11:35.761 --> 11:38.431
There's no way somebody's
gonna get full back-piece wings

11:38.497 --> 11:39.565
in three hours.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.400
-Who are the front-runners?
-Matti.

11:41.467 --> 11:42.968
The line work
is nice and black.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.270
The shading's solid.

11:44.336 --> 11:46.238
The application's
technically precise.

11:46.305 --> 11:49.208
Scott's tattoo-- Did he draw
it accurately? No.

11:49.275 --> 11:52.311
Did he precisely tattoo it?
Yes.

11:52.378 --> 11:53.746
All right,
sounds like we have a decision.

11:53.813 --> 11:55.081
-You want to let them know?
-Yeah, absolutely.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.649
All right.
Let's do it.

11:56.715 --> 12:00.586
Artists, today we asked you
to use technical precision

12:00.653 --> 12:02.555
to give your canvases
superpowers.

12:02.621 --> 12:04.890
Some of you rose
to the challenge.

12:04.957 --> 12:06.258
Matti?

12:06.325 --> 12:08.594
Really strong line work,
technical precision,

12:08.661 --> 12:10.629
straightforward
and right to the point.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.598
-Scott.
[Oliver] Super clean tattoo.

12:12.665 --> 12:17.002
A lot of really nice details
in there, very precise.

12:17.069 --> 12:19.038
The judges have decided.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.607
The winner
of today's flash challenge is...

12:24.677 --> 12:26.645
Matti.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.350
The simpler design
led us to be able to see

12:31.417 --> 12:33.152
how technically precise
your line work was

12:33.219 --> 12:34.787
and your shading was.
Good job.

12:34.854 --> 12:37.323
[Dave] You will have the power
to assign the human canvases

12:37.389 --> 12:39.291
at the elimination tattoo.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.694
{\an8}It feels really good to have won
this flash challenge.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.597
Now I get to go into
the elimination picking skulls,

12:44.663 --> 12:46.165
and I'm gonna hand out
some whoppers

12:46.232 --> 12:47.433
to a couple of people.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.435
Head back to the loft
and prepare

12:49.502 --> 12:51.637
to meet your canvases
for the elimination tattoo.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.810
{\an8}Being a nice guy's
not gonna win you <i> Ink Master.</i>

12:57.877 --> 13:00.579
{\an8}[bleep] I got a lot
of [bleep]-yous to give out.

13:07.853 --> 13:09.522
If Scott had put them
tail feathers

13:09.588 --> 13:11.056
up about 1/4 inch,

13:11.123 --> 13:14.226
I'm pretty sure he would have
taken me on that one.

13:14.293 --> 13:16.462
-It was a very nice one.
-Thanks.

13:16.529 --> 13:17.963
It's nice to win.

13:18.030 --> 13:20.666
Pretty happy to see
a change of guard of some sort,

13:20.733 --> 13:22.368
because Scott
is definitely a threat.

13:22.434 --> 13:23.969
See,
I'm not worried about Scott.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.204
You got a plan then now?

13:25.271 --> 13:26.906
I-- Pfft, no.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.841
I'm tired of being
in the middle of the road,

13:28.908 --> 13:32.144
so I'm trying to sway Matti
to dethrone Scott

13:32.211 --> 13:34.980
without being too obvious.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.183
Do you think
you're gunning for Scott?

13:37.249 --> 13:39.552
Yeah, it's not--
There's no question.

13:39.618 --> 13:42.555
What's Kyle up to?

13:42.621 --> 13:45.057
Kyle's scheming back here.
What's he instigating about?

13:45.124 --> 13:47.059
Don't listen
to his conspiracy theory, Matti.

13:47.126 --> 13:49.061
What do you think
Matti should do, bro?

13:49.128 --> 13:50.863
I wish I knew
a good strategy, you know?

13:50.930 --> 13:52.498
If I knew a good strategy,
I wouldn't be here

13:52.565 --> 13:54.066
losing every single time.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.835
Matti, if you get somebody
that's got, like, 20 ideas,

13:56.902 --> 13:58.504
and they're not bending,
throw it at Kyle.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.340
-[bleep] bury him, dude.
-Did you hear that, Kyle?

14:01.407 --> 14:03.042
[chuckles]

14:03.108 --> 14:04.276
Kyle is just weak.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.844
I can't stand waiting, man.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.880
I just want my challenge,
and I want to get on it.

14:07.947 --> 14:09.915
So that means you got
to give Scott a hard one.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.450
Give me a hard one, dude.
I don't care.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.918
{\an8}I'm not scared,
so I want him to bring it.

14:24.897 --> 14:26.498
Welcome
to the elimination tattoo.

14:26.565 --> 14:27.933
Don't screw it up,

14:28.000 --> 14:30.736
or you'll be packing
your machines for good.

14:30.803 --> 14:33.739
You'll be judged by Oliver Peck,
Chris Nuñez, and myself,

14:33.806 --> 14:35.641
but we're not
your only critics.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.610
Once again, viewers at home
will have the opportunity

14:37.676 --> 14:40.613
to go to InkMaster.Spike.com
and vote for the tattoo

14:40.679 --> 14:43.282
that they think is the best.

14:43.349 --> 14:45.417
America's vote will have
a massive impact

14:45.484 --> 14:47.019
at the live finale.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.989
In the elimination tattoo,
it's more important than ever

14:50.055 --> 14:52.358
to win tattoo of the day,
because the winner

14:52.424 --> 14:54.860
must put one artist up
for elimination.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.930
This week, we are testing
technical precision.

14:57.997 --> 15:00.366
If you don't have
technical precision,

15:00.432 --> 15:02.201
{\an8}your lines won't be
in the right spot,

15:02.268 --> 15:03.702
your shading won't be solid.

15:03.769 --> 15:05.471
You'll basically
just make a mess.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.373
Today, you'd better
be on your "A" game,

15:07.439 --> 15:09.408
because you're tattooing
the toughest test

15:09.475 --> 15:12.011
of technical precision,

15:12.077 --> 15:13.679
a color portrait.

15:15.414 --> 15:16.849
This isn't something
that's easy.

15:16.915 --> 15:19.485
{\an8}If you can't
technically tattoo

15:19.551 --> 15:21.854
the shadows
and the precise lines,

15:21.920 --> 15:23.389
it's not gonna look
like the portrait,

15:23.455 --> 15:26.025
-plain and simple.
-But that is not all.

15:26.091 --> 15:28.127
You must tattoo color portraits
of characters

15:28.193 --> 15:31.163
who are recognizable
to millions of fans

15:31.230 --> 15:32.998
all over the world.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.067
X-Men.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.435
Sweet.

15:36.502 --> 15:37.870
Oh, [bleep]

15:37.936 --> 15:40.172
I can't screw this up,
or fans around the world

15:40.239 --> 15:44.043
{\an8}are gonna go,
"What the hell did you just do?"

15:44.109 --> 15:45.444
Let's meet your canvases.

15:49.481 --> 15:51.216
Matti, you won
the flash challenge.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.986
You now have the power
to assign all human canvases.

15:54.053 --> 15:57.723
This is your chance
to use your powers.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.592
{\an8}I know who I think's at the top
and who I need to knock out.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.094
-Rogue.
-Where you thinking

16:02.161 --> 16:04.129
-about putting this?
-On the right side of my ribs.

16:04.196 --> 16:06.098
{\an8}On the ribs?

16:06.165 --> 16:08.600
{\an8}All the other artists are
gonna be gunning for me now,

16:08.667 --> 16:10.803
{\an8}-I say, bring it.
-The Beast on the left chest.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.805
{\an8}Cool.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.141
I do not want to tattoo Beast.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.911
{\an8}It's just a crazy mess
of purplish-blue hair.

16:18.977 --> 16:21.246
-Wolverine.
-[bleep] yeah.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.648
-And you?
-Wolverine.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.386
{\an8}Scott's been in the top
of this competition,

16:27.453 --> 16:30.422
{\an8}and I want to see how I can
stack up against the top.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.824
-Bishop.
-I want it on my calf.

16:31.890 --> 16:33.058
You thinking about doing
full body like that?

16:33.125 --> 16:34.059
Yeah.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.902
{\an8}I definitely want Matti
to start headhunting

16:43.969 --> 16:46.305
for the biggest threats
to him and to me.

16:46.372 --> 16:49.708
Canvases, one by one,
please read the artist's name

16:49.775 --> 16:51.043
on the bottom of your skull.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.778
Gentle Jay.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.480
Halo.

16:54.546 --> 16:55.781
Lydia.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.586
Kyle.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.154
I get Beast.

17:02.221 --> 17:03.789
I got a lot of [bleep]-yous
to give out,

17:03.856 --> 17:05.022
and Matti's one of them.

17:05.089 --> 17:06.492
Bubba.

17:06.558 --> 17:08.460
Roland.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.229
Jim.

17:12.698 --> 17:14.165
{\an8}We've got two Wolverines
out there.

17:17.368 --> 17:21.173
Matti.

17:21.240 --> 17:22.840
-Scott.
-Dude.

17:22.907 --> 17:24.443
I got the opportunity,

17:24.510 --> 17:27.146
and I'm gonna go head-to-head
with Scott Marshall today.

17:29.882 --> 17:32.217
{\an8}Matti's taking a big gamble.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.852
{\an8}Let's get this over with.

17:33.919 --> 17:35.187
Melissa.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.025
Can't do it.

17:40.092 --> 17:41.293
King Ruck.

17:41.360 --> 17:42.561
Keith.

17:42.628 --> 17:44.530
Sausage.

17:44.596 --> 17:46.598
Oh, you got a good one.

17:46.665 --> 17:48.367
Remember, artists.
The winner of tattoo

17:48.434 --> 17:50.002
of the day
will put one artist

17:50.068 --> 17:53.739
up for elimination,
and the human canvas jury

17:53.806 --> 17:55.741
will vote on the tattoo
that they think is the worst,

17:55.808 --> 17:58.043
also putting one artist
up for elimination.

17:58.110 --> 17:59.511
You have the rest
of the evening

17:59.578 --> 18:01.447
to consult
with your human canvases,

18:01.513 --> 18:04.082
and tomorrow
you will have six hours

18:04.149 --> 18:07.419
to create a color portrait
of an X-Men character.

18:07.486 --> 18:10.956
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.758
Good luck.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.526
When you do a color portrait,

18:14.593 --> 18:16.562
{\an8}technical precision
is everything.

18:16.628 --> 18:19.164
If you don't get the feel of it
being that actual person,

18:19.231 --> 18:20.933
your tattoo fails.

18:20.999 --> 18:23.235
I can bump up some color
in here,

18:23.302 --> 18:25.804
because he's got
a real dramatic shadow on there.

18:25.871 --> 18:26.805
We're not getting
the hands in.

18:26.872 --> 18:28.173
-No way at all?
-Oh, no.

18:28.240 --> 18:31.009
My last color portrait
took me 9-1/2 hours.

18:31.076 --> 18:33.712
I won the last two challenges.
Matti took it this time,

18:33.779 --> 18:35.347
so now me and Matti
are going toe-to-toe.

18:35.414 --> 18:38.617
{\an8}This has now become a showdown
with this Wolverine tattoo.

18:38.684 --> 18:39.818
The back of the calf
is horrible, so, yeah,

18:39.885 --> 18:41.053
if you can give me
that thigh, bro,

18:41.119 --> 18:42.554
that's gonna give us
an advantage.

18:42.621 --> 18:43.889
-You got the thigh, brother.
-Awesome.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.958
I have never been
so determined to win.

18:46.024 --> 18:47.659
Same shot.
Where you doing yours?

18:47.726 --> 18:49.328
-Thigh.
-Oh, me too, bro.

18:49.394 --> 18:52.431
{\an8}My canvas wants to get
Bishop tattooed on him.

18:52.498 --> 18:53.799
-I'd prefer this one.
-Uh-huh.

18:53.866 --> 18:55.000
'Cause it shows
more of his suit.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.235
He's only giving me
the opportunity

18:56.301 --> 18:58.270
to make the face
the size of my thumb.

18:58.337 --> 19:01.106
The more of the body we do,
the less detail in the face.

19:01.173 --> 19:04.009
But it shows more of, like,
the superhero feel.

19:04.076 --> 19:05.377
At least up to the waist,
at least.

19:05.444 --> 19:08.146
Maybe blow up his face
a little? I don't know.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.149
A portrait means
exactly off the photo.

19:11.216 --> 19:12.684
I could really
be in trouble.

19:23.695 --> 19:24.930
Well, now
I'm getting worried.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.599
The face is too small.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.034
I can't do that, man.

19:29.101 --> 19:31.203
I'm kind of freaking out.
This is just impossible.

19:31.270 --> 19:32.704
My canvas is being
really difficult,

19:32.771 --> 19:36.909
and I have no idea
how I'm gonna change his mind.

19:36.975 --> 19:38.443
What's going on?
You good? We're good?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.445
Come over here, I want you
to meet the man.

19:40.512 --> 19:42.915
-What's up, man?
-Is this too small?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.617
I would never do it
that small, ever.

19:45.684 --> 19:47.653
You're never gonna get
a good tattoo out of that,

19:47.719 --> 19:50.389
so what I personally would do
is I would do this stuff.

19:50.455 --> 19:52.491
You're saying
I should just do the face?

19:52.558 --> 19:53.692
Yeah.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.027
Like, I would even
pull him back.

19:55.093 --> 19:56.261
-Mm-hmm.
-Like, move these dreads

19:56.328 --> 19:59.131
-over a bit.
-Melissa's asking Halo

19:59.197 --> 20:00.933
how the hell to do
a color portrait tattoo,

20:00.999 --> 20:03.101
{\an8}and he's just
doling out information

20:03.168 --> 20:04.469
{\an8}like it's government cheese.

20:04.536 --> 20:06.538
We just want to get you
the best you can get.

20:06.605 --> 20:09.107
Being a nice guy's
not gonna win you <i> Ink Master.</i>

20:09.174 --> 20:10.208
Are you down
with that, dude?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.810
Yeah.
I'm cool with that.

20:11.877 --> 20:13.111
I love you forever, Halo.

20:13.178 --> 20:15.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:15.147 --> 20:19.084
You have six hours to tattoo
an X-Men color portrait,

20:19.151 --> 20:21.987
and your time starts now.

20:22.054 --> 20:23.255
-Okay.
-Let's do this.

20:23.322 --> 20:24.890
{\an8}When looking
at a color portrait,

20:24.957 --> 20:27.960
{\an8}you're looking for it to be
an exact replica of the photo.

20:28.026 --> 20:29.528
Therefore, everything
has to be precise.

20:29.595 --> 20:30.963
The eyes have to line up.
The shading

20:31.029 --> 20:32.531
on the nose
has to be just right.

20:32.598 --> 20:35.634
You have to capture every
little essence of the face.

20:35.701 --> 20:36.802
Yeah, dude.

20:36.868 --> 20:38.403
Can't wait.
Let's do it.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.479
I've done over 100
color portraits in my career.

20:47.546 --> 20:49.348
Not everybody knows
how to do a color portrait.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.450
{\an8}This is something
that I know how to do.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.518
People saying, like,
they've never done portraits,

20:53.585 --> 20:55.821
and I'm thinking,
"In the last three seasons,

20:55.887 --> 20:57.389
they've always
done portraits."

20:57.456 --> 21:00.225
You had to assume that you were
gonna be doing a portrait.

21:00.292 --> 21:01.460
This is my specialty.

21:01.526 --> 21:03.295
I know I'm gonna win
this challenge.

21:03.362 --> 21:04.563
It's like, how could you come
into a competition like this

21:04.630 --> 21:07.332
and not get
your [bleep] together?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.104
So I'm feeling
really good about my tattoo.

21:12.170 --> 21:14.706
{\an8}It's coming out
exactly the way I want it to.

21:14.773 --> 21:16.008
Very nice, very nice.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.843
It's looking really good.

21:17.909 --> 21:19.544
The nose, lips,
eyes, cheekbones

21:19.611 --> 21:22.481
look exactly
like the reference.

21:22.547 --> 21:24.082
I love it.

21:24.149 --> 21:25.984
Four hours remaining.

21:31.490 --> 21:33.659
There only could
be one Wolverine.

21:33.725 --> 21:35.661
Uh, yeah.
Might be me.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.162
I think it might be me.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.697
My guy won the last
challenge, so...

21:38.764 --> 21:40.565
Only time will tell, amigo.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.100
I am so focused.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.102
{\an8}There is no [bleep] way
that Matti's gonna beat me.

21:44.169 --> 21:45.404
It's awesome, man.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.139
If he wins,
he can validate his skill.

21:47.205 --> 21:48.874
If I win, you know,
it's [bleep] cool.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.375
I used to get
in a lot of fights.

21:50.442 --> 21:53.078
By the time I was 21,
I got in a really bad fight.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.112
I put a guy
in the hospital.

21:54.179 --> 21:55.447
I could have killed him.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.216
Finding tattooing,
it saved my life.

21:58.283 --> 22:00.485
It's bold, man.
I dig it.

22:05.157 --> 22:07.025
I really just want to blow
Scott out of the water.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.161
We were up first
and second last time.

22:09.227 --> 22:10.896
We might as well
keep that going.

22:10.962 --> 22:12.397
I came here
for my daughter.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.599
Near the end of high school,
my girlfriend told me

22:14.666 --> 22:15.901
we were gonna
have a little baby.

22:15.967 --> 22:17.235
When that news hit me,

22:17.302 --> 22:19.538
I felt a fire
light under my ass.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.073
Ever since,
everything I've done

22:21.139 --> 22:22.841
has been for me
and my daughter.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.544
I would have been psyched to do
any kind of color portrait.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.914
When you get to do one,
dude, it's really cool.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.515
Two hours to go.

22:36.688 --> 22:39.391
{\an8}Right now, I am stuck in the
middle of the road at best,

22:39.458 --> 22:41.793
{\an8}and I need to get
the [bleep] off this road.

22:41.860 --> 22:44.529
{\an8}What's going on here?

22:48.834 --> 22:51.002
Kyle's hitting some
of the essence of the tattoo,

22:51.069 --> 22:53.705
but the technical precision
is completely out the window.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.540
One thing about Kyle,
the harder I ride him,

22:55.607 --> 22:57.109
the better off
he does in the end.

22:57.175 --> 22:58.343
This is a tough one.

22:58.410 --> 23:00.579
He wasn't scared to give
the good ones

23:00.645 --> 23:01.880
to the right people.

23:01.947 --> 23:04.483
Kyle kind of works off
of animosity and anger.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.152
If I want to see him do good,
I need to stay on him.

23:09.454 --> 23:11.690
{\an8}My canvas wanted to get
the knives in,

23:11.757 --> 23:13.558
but I'm very concerned
about time.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.527
I'm very upset that
I can't fit them in.

23:15.594 --> 23:18.130
If I don't finish this tattoo,
I'm screwed.

23:18.196 --> 23:20.031
{\an8}Because Warpath
always has knives,

23:20.098 --> 23:21.533
as soon as you take
his knives out,

23:21.600 --> 23:24.836
it's no longer Warpath.
It could just be anybody.

23:24.903 --> 23:26.238
This is a huge mistake.

23:26.304 --> 23:27.439
I just hope
it looks good.

23:27.506 --> 23:28.673
You think
it's gonna look good?

23:28.740 --> 23:30.976
-I think it'll look cool.
-Okay.

23:31.042 --> 23:33.278
You have 30 minutes left,
everybody.

23:38.917 --> 23:40.085
You didn't give up yet,
though?

23:40.152 --> 23:42.654
It's okay if you tap out.

23:42.721 --> 23:44.723
Going into this challenge,
I was really nervous,

23:44.790 --> 23:46.691
but we're getting
through this tattoo.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.527
{\an8}I'm really actually feeling
pretty good about it.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.762
My character looks
how he's supposed to look.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.131
-You're doing [bleep] awesome.
-Yeah.

23:53.198 --> 23:55.000
I feel pretty confident
at this point.

23:55.066 --> 23:59.938
Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six,

24:00.005 --> 24:04.676
five, four, three, two, one.

24:04.743 --> 24:08.046
That's it.
Machines down, no more ink.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.148
All right,
my young lady.

24:10.215 --> 24:12.851
Wow.
That is awesome.

24:12.918 --> 24:14.152
Oh, yeah.

24:14.219 --> 24:15.153
That's the number one
Wolverine.

24:15.220 --> 24:17.189
[chuckles]
Awesome.

24:17.255 --> 24:18.290
-What do you think?
-[bleep] like it.

24:18.356 --> 24:19.958
-You like it? Sweet.
-Yeah.

24:20.025 --> 24:22.894
{\an8}Lydia's portrait looks like a
girlfriend that got cheated on

24:22.961 --> 24:25.463
and is gonna burn your house
down, slash your tires,

24:25.530 --> 24:26.998
and break the windows
on your car.

24:27.065 --> 24:28.633
That's supposed
to be a guy.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.404
{\an8}Before we announce the winner,

24:32.470 --> 24:34.172
there's one more person
we'd like to have

24:34.239 --> 24:36.141
check out your portraits.

24:44.549 --> 24:46.818
Scott, I thought your tattoo
was [bleep] awesome.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.887
Wow.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.255
Thank you.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.290
If it was graphic novel
[bleep] day,

24:52.357 --> 24:55.660
-but it's color portrait day.
-That was a color portrait.

24:55.727 --> 24:56.995
-Well, I understand that.
-That's just how I do them.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.396
But you're telling me
that Halo's piece

24:58.463 --> 24:59.831
or Sausage's piece
didn't look--

24:59.898 --> 25:02.100
Is there a rule on
how to do a color portrait?

25:02.167 --> 25:03.969
No, it's supposed
to look like a photograph.

25:04.035 --> 25:05.237
That was the challenge.

25:05.303 --> 25:07.105
It wasn't
a photorealism challenge.

25:07.172 --> 25:08.573
We already did that one.

25:08.640 --> 25:10.041
I don't know what planet
Scott's on

25:10.108 --> 25:11.877
that he thinks he has
this challenge won today,

25:11.943 --> 25:14.613
but he's wrong.
Scott took the easy way out,

25:14.679 --> 25:16.548
{\an8}probably because he can't do
a color portrait.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.717
It generally means
photorealistic

25:18.783 --> 25:21.052
when you're doing a portrait,
correct?

25:21.119 --> 25:23.255
Dude, that's one
of the best damn color portraits

25:23.321 --> 25:24.890
I've ever done
in my career and--

25:24.956 --> 25:26.625
Because he's Scott,
he wants to win everything,

25:26.691 --> 25:28.226
so of course he did it
the right way.

25:28.293 --> 25:30.795
I did a lot of line work
to show, uh--

25:30.862 --> 25:32.230
-What was the challenge?
-Photorealism.

25:32.297 --> 25:34.566
No.
Color portrait.

25:34.633 --> 25:37.068
And what?
Precision.

25:38.436 --> 25:40.372
All these artists
are whining and crying.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.908
{\an8}"Wah, wah, wah."
Just pack your bags and go home.

25:58.056 --> 26:00.825
Today, we asked you
to use technical precision

26:00.892 --> 26:04.562
to create
an X-Men color portrait.

26:04.629 --> 26:07.732
Melissa,
let's start with you.

26:07.799 --> 26:09.868
Melissa, there's a lot of good
things about this tattoo.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.637
{\an8}Number one,
it does look like the actor.

26:12.704 --> 26:13.972
{\an8}Where you fell short

26:14.039 --> 26:15.907
is that contrast
could have been upped a lot more

26:15.974 --> 26:18.043
to give this dramatic look
that it needs.

26:18.109 --> 26:21.446
I can tell in this work that,
if you did 50 of these,

26:21.513 --> 26:22.747
you'd be a nightmare

26:22.814 --> 26:23.949
for the people standing
behind you.

26:24.015 --> 26:25.650
Thank you.

26:28.219 --> 26:30.055
Jim.

26:30.121 --> 26:33.291
{\an8}Technically, there's not a lot
of precision in this tattoo.

26:33.358 --> 26:36.161
{\an8}It's a very soft focus and you
didn't get the darkness.

26:36.227 --> 26:38.463
Did that on purpose just
so you could see a jaw line,

26:38.530 --> 26:40.932
so it just wasn't all
a big, black mass.

26:40.999 --> 26:43.168
Look how much more dramatic
the photo looks.

26:43.234 --> 26:45.804
It's gonna give it
more of a character feel.

26:45.870 --> 26:48.640
This looks like the dude
at the line at the supermarket.

26:48.707 --> 26:51.776
And it doesn't have
that richness or that pop to it.

26:51.843 --> 26:54.179
It looks like you did this
five years ago.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.084
Keith.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.685
It's not an ugly tattoo,

27:00.752 --> 27:02.687
{\an8}but it does not look like
Halle Berry.

27:02.754 --> 27:04.856
{\an8}This is a very tricky hairdo
that she has.

27:04.923 --> 27:07.025
{\an8}Trying to get the black roots
to look like they're deep

27:07.092 --> 27:09.661
{\an8}in the hairdo is a very tough
trick to pull off.

27:09.728 --> 27:12.797
You kind of lost it
in that hair a little bit.

27:12.864 --> 27:14.532
Kyle.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.202
[Chris] You definitely
took some liberties.

27:17.268 --> 27:18.737
{\an8}Blue Beast is blue.

27:18.803 --> 27:21.706
{\an8}I've got a balancing act
that I'm teetering on right now.

27:21.773 --> 27:23.808
Not as confident as I was
a couple days ago.

27:23.875 --> 27:27.112
I give you a hard time because
you work better like that.

27:27.178 --> 27:29.180
Last season,
I hammered you repeatedly,

27:29.247 --> 27:31.116
and everything got better
every week.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.818
And you have to believe
in your tattooing.

27:33.885 --> 27:36.287
You had a tough one today,
and you did this a lot better

27:36.354 --> 27:39.124
than some of the people
standing behind you would have.

27:41.459 --> 27:43.561
Lydia.

27:44.896 --> 27:47.599
{\an8}What happened here
with the negative space

27:47.665 --> 27:49.234
{\an8}underneath this gentleman?

27:49.300 --> 27:51.870
{\an8}He initially had the knives,
but I didn't have enough time,

27:51.936 --> 27:53.938
so I just figured
I'd put a big "X" down there.

27:54.005 --> 27:57.208
What makes this character
recognizably X-Men

27:57.275 --> 27:58.443
are those blades.

27:58.510 --> 27:59.544
Missing those,
it's very difficult

27:59.611 --> 28:01.179
for me to know who this is.

28:01.246 --> 28:04.149
The problem's with just the
structure of the portrait.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.917
The shape on one side
of the nose,

28:05.984 --> 28:07.552
the crease you put in
and the dark shadow,

28:07.619 --> 28:08.820
they don't line up.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.355
In the photo,
his lips are straight.

28:10.422 --> 28:11.990
In your tattoo,
they look crooked.

28:12.057 --> 28:15.560
Your technical precision
and getting these details exact

28:15.627 --> 28:19.264
is where the portrait itself
falls short.

28:19.330 --> 28:20.598
That's a big mark to miss.

28:23.134 --> 28:24.669
Sausage.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.807
I really, really like
the background.

28:28.873 --> 28:31.609
{\an8}It puts a comic book feel
to a realistic portrait.

28:31.676 --> 28:34.279
{\an8}Looking at this tattoo,
it has so many tricks.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.880
You have great application.

28:35.947 --> 28:37.615
You have
really solid fundamentals.

28:37.682 --> 28:39.551
Overall, man, good job.

28:42.887 --> 28:43.922
Halo.

28:45.890 --> 28:47.725
Halo, man,
this is a great tattoo.

28:47.792 --> 28:49.727
{\an8}Your skin tone is
a lot darker than the photo.

28:49.794 --> 28:51.963
{\an8}That is a good choice.

28:52.030 --> 28:55.033
{\an8}You have to up the contrast
on these light skin tones,

28:55.100 --> 28:57.135
or else they're just
gonna blend into

28:57.202 --> 28:59.237
the person's
natural skin tone.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.973
Your experience really shined
through in this challenge.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.108
Very good job.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.646
King Ruck.

29:08.713 --> 29:10.882
{\an8}You did the helmet
straight out of the comic book.

29:10.949 --> 29:13.751
{\an8}It looks like an illustration,
but inside the face,

29:13.818 --> 29:15.854
{\an8}you did
a realistic color portrait.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.056
It made
for a strong, bold tattoo

29:18.123 --> 29:21.659
that still has the aspects
of a portrait in it.

29:21.726 --> 29:22.760
You took
the comic book approach,

29:22.827 --> 29:24.262
but you still did a nice job.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.998
You just didn't listen,
but you did a nice job.

29:29.367 --> 29:30.735
Bubba.

29:30.802 --> 29:32.437
You didn't capture
the likeness of the person.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.507
{\an8}This whole side of her head
looks like it's the wrong shape

29:35.573 --> 29:36.875
{\an8}because
it's highlighted different.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.277
I've never done
blue anything, really.

29:39.344 --> 29:42.147
Mixing blues and that kind of
thing is pretty difficult.

29:42.213 --> 29:45.984
Knowing your colors,
that is tattooing 101.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.990
Jay.

29:52.056 --> 29:55.126
{\an8}You definitely did not capture
the look of the character.

29:55.193 --> 29:57.495
{\an8}What I don't understand
is why you put in dark areas

29:57.562 --> 29:59.063
where they don't exist.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.932
I was trying to put
the shading in with black

30:00.999 --> 30:02.800
so that over time
it would last.

30:02.867 --> 30:04.002
The deep creases
in the forehead

30:04.068 --> 30:05.803
and the shape
of that upper lip

30:05.870 --> 30:08.006
completely changed
the expression.

30:08.072 --> 30:10.108
That totally killed
this tattoo for me.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.946
Roland.

30:15.013 --> 30:16.247
When you're doing
a portrait,

30:16.314 --> 30:18.149
you got to copy
the structure of the face.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.652
{\an8}She does not even
have the same shape.

30:20.718 --> 30:22.654
{\an8}The color fades
are not there.

30:22.720 --> 30:24.789
{\an8}Color, as you know,
is not my forte.

30:24.856 --> 30:26.324
I don't find
any redeeming qualities

30:26.391 --> 30:28.193
in this tattoo at all.

30:30.728 --> 30:31.863
Matti.

30:33.765 --> 30:35.733
You definitely upped
the contrast a lot,

30:35.800 --> 30:37.802
{\an8}made this a strong,
heavy tattoo,

30:37.869 --> 30:39.904
{\an8}but you still have to maintain

30:39.971 --> 30:42.140
the original structure
of the face.

30:42.207 --> 30:44.609
You gave him some heavy bags
under the eyes,

30:44.676 --> 30:45.977
and that puts years on him.

30:46.044 --> 30:47.946
But you brought a lot of work
to this.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.181
I love the way you took
an artistic liberty

30:50.248 --> 30:52.884
in the right side of the face
and brought that white highlight

30:52.951 --> 30:54.719
to really get
that back-lit look.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.187
That was a really nice touch,

30:56.254 --> 30:58.690
and you came and you really
outdid a lot of people.

31:01.593 --> 31:03.361
Scott.

31:05.430 --> 31:07.031
{\an8}You stuck to the structure
of the face.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.967
{\an8}You kept the likeness
of the character.

31:09.033 --> 31:10.868
{\an8}Not going with the dark
background around the hair

31:10.935 --> 31:12.237
{\an8}I think is a wise choice.

31:12.303 --> 31:15.907
This tattoo has
a ton of technical precision.

31:15.974 --> 31:18.977
That nice, clean netting
in that armor, it's beautiful.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.778
The glow in the background
is nice.

31:20.845 --> 31:22.113
It's a good use
of color palette,

31:22.180 --> 31:24.082
and overall
it's a really strong tattoo.

31:28.586 --> 31:31.823
Artists, it's time
to find out exactly how precise

31:31.889 --> 31:33.324
your portraits are.

31:33.391 --> 31:36.828
We have a special sneak preview
of the new X-Men movie,

31:36.894 --> 31:40.265
X-Men: Days Of Future Past,
coming out May 23rd.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.968
Let's take a look and see
how your work stacks up.

31:44.836 --> 31:46.204
<i>From the beginning,</i>

31:46.271 --> 31:49.040
<i>the sentinels</i>
<i>were targeting X-Men.</i>

31:49.107 --> 31:52.543
<i>Then they began</i>
<i>targeting everyone.</i>

31:52.610 --> 31:54.979
<i>It's going to take all of us.</i>

31:55.046 --> 31:57.315
<i>This is gonna be fun.</i>

32:02.820 --> 32:04.756
<i>Well, he's fascinating.</i>

32:04.822 --> 32:07.358
<i>He's a pain in the ass.</i>

32:09.627 --> 32:11.362
<i>Are you sure about this?</i>

32:11.429 --> 32:13.464
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

32:17.735 --> 32:19.937
<i>It's us or them.</i>

32:20.004 --> 32:22.140
<i>She is unique.</i>

32:24.575 --> 32:26.177
<i>What's the matter, baby?</i>

32:26.244 --> 32:27.745
<i>You don't think</i>
<i>I look pretty like this?</i>

32:32.317 --> 32:33.418
Yeah!

32:35.486 --> 32:37.455
Before we announce the winner,
let's bring your canvases

32:37.522 --> 32:39.524
back in for one last look.

32:44.962 --> 32:46.497
There's one more person
we'd like to have

32:46.564 --> 32:48.333
check out your portraits.

32:48.399 --> 32:50.868
He's the ultimate authority
on these characters

32:50.935 --> 32:53.971
because he plays one of them.

33:07.518 --> 33:09.120
There's one more person
we'd like to have

33:09.187 --> 33:11.589
check out your portraits.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.192
He's the ultimate authority
on these characters

33:14.258 --> 33:18.229
because he plays one of them.

33:18.296 --> 33:21.699
Tony, Emmy,
and Golden Globe-winning actor

33:21.766 --> 33:22.934
Hugh Jackman.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.969
-Yes!
-What?

33:25.036 --> 33:28.072
[cheers and applause]

33:28.139 --> 33:29.941
Hey, guys.

33:30.007 --> 33:31.943
How are you, man?

33:32.009 --> 33:32.977
-Wow.
-Wow.

33:33.044 --> 33:34.445
Can I hug you?

33:34.512 --> 33:36.114
You can hug me.
Of course you can.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.415
-Oh!
-That's awesome.

33:37.482 --> 33:40.418
-Hugh, good to see you.
-How are you, man?

33:40.485 --> 33:41.686
-Great to see you too.
-Thank you so much for coming.

33:41.753 --> 33:42.920
-Thank you.
-Hey, buddy.

33:42.987 --> 33:44.389
Hugh is here
to check out your work

33:44.455 --> 33:45.623
and help us choose the winner.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.226
Artists, please bring up
your canvases,

33:48.292 --> 33:51.162
and we will start
with Sausage.

33:51.229 --> 33:52.563
Hey, Sausage, I don't
say that every day.

33:52.630 --> 33:55.032
-I'm sure you don't.
-How are you, man.

33:55.099 --> 33:59.036
Wow.
That is fantastic.

33:59.103 --> 34:00.238
I'm just amazed
by the artistry.

34:00.304 --> 34:01.539
-Right?
-It's just phenomenal.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.141
-How long did that take?
-Six hours.

34:03.207 --> 34:04.308
Six hours?
That's it?

34:04.375 --> 34:05.743
-Phew.
-That's our time limit.

34:05.810 --> 34:07.044
Iceman.

34:07.111 --> 34:08.379
Fantastic.

34:08.446 --> 34:09.781
Calf's got to hurt too,
right?

34:09.847 --> 34:10.947
Yeah.
It all hurts.

34:11.014 --> 34:12.949
-It all hurts, got it.
-Yeah.

34:13.016 --> 34:14.051
-That is beautiful.
-Thank you.

34:14.118 --> 34:15.386
Got a soft spot for Halle,

34:15.453 --> 34:17.355
so I can look at this one
for a long time.

34:17.422 --> 34:20.558
Whoa, holy--
that is incredible.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.527
I'm just the guy who says
good things, by the way.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.262
I leave the--
All the other stuff for you.

34:24.328 --> 34:26.063
That is really incredible.

34:26.130 --> 34:27.764
-You might enjoy this one.
-Yeah.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.101
[laughter]

34:30.168 --> 34:31.702
That is awesome.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.271
Wow, that's a lot of work
going into that.

34:33.337 --> 34:35.973
That is fantastic.

34:36.040 --> 34:37.241
Yeah, bring it.

34:37.308 --> 34:39.543
Both chose the thigh.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.245
It was a little bit
of a duel we had going on.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.281
That's pretty badass.
Look at that.

34:43.347 --> 34:44.614
It's always weird
meeting someone

34:44.681 --> 34:46.417
when you know your picture's
on their leg

34:46.484 --> 34:47.885
for the rest of their life.
That's...

34:47.952 --> 34:48.886
[laughter]

34:48.953 --> 34:50.388
Hugh, what'd you think, man?

34:50.455 --> 34:52.623
Honestly, all of them
exceeded my expectations.

34:52.690 --> 34:55.193
The likeness, the detail,
the character,

34:55.259 --> 34:57.361
the way you deal with,
not a blank canvas,

34:57.428 --> 34:59.697
but a curved canvas on the body,

34:59.764 --> 35:01.065
to me, is astonishing.

35:01.132 --> 35:02.600
And from someone
who lives in that world

35:02.667 --> 35:04.502
and hangs out with those people
all the time,

35:04.569 --> 35:07.538
I can tell you every one of
the actors would be blown away

35:07.605 --> 35:10.041
by what you've done,
so you should be really proud.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.042
Do we have a winner?

35:11.108 --> 35:13.077
We do have a winner,

35:13.144 --> 35:17.014
and the winner is...

35:17.081 --> 35:18.816
Scott.

35:18.883 --> 35:23.254
[applause]

35:23.321 --> 35:25.590
All right.
Congratulations, Scott.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.458
You will have the power
to put the one artist

35:27.525 --> 35:29.360
that you think
has the worst tattoo

35:29.427 --> 35:30.995
up for elimination.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.497
Head back to the loft,

35:32.563 --> 35:34.298
and we'll call you back
when we have a decision.

35:37.335 --> 35:39.103
Later.
Awesome.

35:45.843 --> 35:48.279
All right.
Today, technical precision.

35:48.346 --> 35:50.815
Color portraits
of X-Men characters.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.050
Let's talk
about the bottom of the day.

35:53.117 --> 35:54.652
Keith's looks
really unfinished.

35:54.719 --> 35:58.389
That left cheekbone,
it's a hard angle coming in.

35:58.456 --> 36:00.291
It doesn't look
like Halle Berry.

36:00.358 --> 36:03.528
Definitely doesn't have
a realistic feel to it.

36:03.594 --> 36:06.397
Gentle Jay turned in
the young Professor X.

36:06.464 --> 36:08.833
Too drastic on some
of the details in his face

36:08.900 --> 36:11.435
-and added a lot of stuff.
-The furrowed brow.

36:11.502 --> 36:14.205
And the snarl on the lips
and the crease in the face.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.873
Jay just missed
the mark on capturing

36:15.940 --> 36:17.975
the look of this actor.

36:18.042 --> 36:19.644
[Dave] Lydia did Warpath.

36:19.710 --> 36:22.346
This technical precision
that she's lacking

36:22.413 --> 36:24.815
shows in just looking
at the shape of the lips

36:24.882 --> 36:26.751
and looking at the shadow
along the side of the face

36:26.817 --> 36:28.119
and the look of the hair.

36:28.185 --> 36:31.289
It will take a lot of work
to fix this face up.

36:31.355 --> 36:32.790
[Dave]
And Roland.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.459
[Oliver] This tattoo didn't keep
the shape of the face.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.461
He didn't put the shadows
on the tattoo

36:37.528 --> 36:39.497
in the same place
as shadows in the portrait.

36:39.564 --> 36:41.933
This is the antithesis
of technical precision.

36:41.999 --> 36:43.534
Someone's got to go home.

36:43.601 --> 36:45.403
It'll be interesting to see
who the human canvas jury

36:45.469 --> 36:46.771
puts up for elimination.

36:49.140 --> 36:50.274
{\an8}We are here to determine

36:50.341 --> 36:52.176
{\an8}who has the worst tattoo
of the day.

36:52.243 --> 36:53.711
This is my tattoo.

36:53.778 --> 36:56.847
My artist was Roland,
and I had a portrait of Blink.

36:56.914 --> 36:58.516
One eye is bigger
than the other eye.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.318
The nose is off,
and the cheek is off.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.819
It changes
the face structure.

37:01.886 --> 37:03.354
If you're a comic book fan,
you know who Blink is.

37:03.421 --> 37:05.356
-You can tell this is Blink.
-But six hours.

37:05.423 --> 37:07.925
Doesn't look like it
took six hours.

37:07.992 --> 37:11.529
This is my tattoo, Warpath,
and my tattoo artist was Lydia.

37:11.596 --> 37:14.198
He doesn't look like
any X-Man character.

37:14.265 --> 37:15.766
One cheek looks droopy.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.568
Kind of looks like he has,
like, a lump.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.537
-Yeah.
-There's really not much color.

37:19.604 --> 37:21.439
-I disagree.
-At least Blink had color.

37:21.505 --> 37:23.574
Are you guys saying that
because Blink has pink in it,

37:23.641 --> 37:24.875
though, or is it just because--

37:24.942 --> 37:26.444
He doesn't have that
much color in him.

37:26.510 --> 37:27.845
But the red almost seems
like an afterthought.

37:27.912 --> 37:30.481
I don't think anything
about this was badass.

37:30.548 --> 37:32.450
Look at Blink.
You get it right away.

37:32.516 --> 37:34.352
Here you got to do
a lot of thinking.

37:34.418 --> 37:35.920
So we have a decision?

37:35.987 --> 37:37.555
-Yeah.
-Yes.

37:37.622 --> 37:39.657
♪♪

37:48.366 --> 37:49.567
All right, Scott.

37:49.634 --> 37:51.435
Who are you putting up
for elimination?

37:55.272 --> 37:58.209
Roland.

37:58.275 --> 38:02.880
All right, Scott.
We'll see you, Roland,

38:02.947 --> 38:05.750
and Lydia down in the shop.

38:10.855 --> 38:12.256
Good luck, everybody.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.592
Good luck, guys.

38:22.500 --> 38:25.536
Today, you tattooed
the best test of precision

38:25.603 --> 38:28.839
that there is,
a color portrait.

38:28.906 --> 38:31.008
Roland, you're here

38:31.075 --> 38:33.644
because Scott put you
up for elimination.

38:33.711 --> 38:36.347
Scott, why did you put Roland
up for elimination?

38:36.414 --> 38:38.716
I felt that his piece
was one of the weakest.

38:38.783 --> 38:40.918
This one, that was it for him,
in my opinion.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.720
I will admit this is
a very difficult tattoo.

38:42.787 --> 38:44.989
It's been
out of my repertoire.

38:45.056 --> 38:46.090
But I'm here to fight.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.458
I'm here
to [bleep] stay here.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.026
When we come
to this challenge,

38:49.093 --> 38:50.661
this is technical precision,

38:50.728 --> 38:52.730
and we're looking
for very specific details.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.598
This tattoo is just
not up to par

38:54.665 --> 38:56.400
with the rest of the people.

38:58.903 --> 39:01.672
Lydia, you're here
because the human canvases

39:01.739 --> 39:03.908
determined that you had
the worst tattoo of the day.

39:03.974 --> 39:05.876
As far as my tattoo
being worse than Roland,

39:05.943 --> 39:07.178
I don't agree with that.

39:07.244 --> 39:09.780
I believe I'm a better
tattoo artist than him.

39:09.847 --> 39:12.550
When the human canvas jury
calls you down,

39:12.616 --> 39:14.318
that for you is
a major nail in the coffin.

39:14.385 --> 39:15.786
That's your client base.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.987
It was a tough tattoo
to get through,

39:17.054 --> 39:17.988
and I over thought it.

39:18.055 --> 39:18.989
I'm a good tattoo artist.

39:19.056 --> 39:21.959
I'm not ready to go home.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.728
Roland and Lydia,

39:23.794 --> 39:25.930
either one of you could be
packing your machines.

39:28.632 --> 39:29.967
The judges have decided.

39:35.439 --> 39:38.175
Roland...

39:38.242 --> 39:41.746
You do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.681
Roland, this is
a very difficult competition.

39:43.748 --> 39:45.316
This is a challenge
of high skill.

39:45.382 --> 39:46.751
It's just
that much more evident

39:46.817 --> 39:49.420
that you do not have
these abilities.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.656
Please pack your machines
and close shop.

39:54.658 --> 39:56.193
I definitely don't think
I should go.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.195
Do I think that I have
to change the way I tattoo

39:58.262 --> 40:00.431
to fit in their [bleep] idea
of what a tattoo is?

40:00.498 --> 40:01.899
No.
I'm an artist.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.401
I do what I [bleep] like,
and I like what I do.
