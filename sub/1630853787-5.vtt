KOURTNEY: <i>Previously on</i> High School
Musical: The Musical: The Series...

00:05.255 --> 00:09.634
When Corbin Bleu returns for your
first table read, you must de-stress.

00:09.968 --> 00:13.471
Yeah, baby. Let's hug it out.
Bring it in. Come on.

00:13.722 --> 00:14.889

00:15.390 --> 00:16.850
-Dope outfit.
-Kourtney.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.310
And try to hide the mess.

00:19.811 --> 00:20.854
Wait. Jet's not here.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.522
What's with Jet? Is he troubled?

00:22.814 --> 00:24.149
They think we have no drama?

00:24.816 --> 00:29.070
-My mom is moving back.
-What?

00:31.197 --> 00:33.533
Hey, Val, did you know about this letter?

00:33.783 --> 00:35.618
I'm so glad we fooled them.

00:36.119 --> 00:37.120
I can get you drama.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.513
Morning, guys. Come on in.
We don't have much time.

00:55.930 --> 00:59.559
-Take a seat.
-Did EJ tell you what this was about?

00:59.976 --> 01:03.063
Nope. But you should ask Val. (CHUCKLES)

01:03.146 --> 01:05.774
I'm kidding. Don't ask Val.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.610
Yeah. Funny story from last night.

01:08.693 --> 01:13.198
It looks like EJ is apparently moving
to St. Louis for his gap year.

01:15.325 --> 01:17.911
I'm going to talk to him
about it after rehearsal.

01:18.870 --> 01:21.164
But today, I am here to play Anna.

01:21.831 --> 01:24.834
I'm just gonna stick to the script.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

01:27.378 --> 01:29.756
Can we have everyone's attention please?

01:30.048 --> 01:32.592
Thanks for coming in early, guys.
We've been up all night.

01:32.801 --> 01:35.512
Look, this better be good,
because in here, it's still last night.

01:35.678 --> 01:38.098
We've been working
on a plan to save the show

01:38.223 --> 01:40.016
and give Corbin and that Channing guy

01:40.100 --> 01:42.352
the reality show style juice
that they really want.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.687
Sorry. Save the show?

01:45.146 --> 01:47.774
He just wants a little more
excitement from us. A little more...

01:47.857 --> 01:49.901
-He thinks we're boring.
-(ALL GASP)

01:49.984 --> 01:51.569
He's missing our rehearsal today

01:51.653 --> 01:54.531
to scout out the kids
at Deep Lake Camp in Temecula.

01:54.823 --> 01:58.952
-That can't be a real place.
-But not to worry, because we have a plan.

01:59.369 --> 02:02.664
And it starts with five little letters.

02:03.206 --> 02:04.249
Allow me.

02:06.042 --> 02:07.502
Watch what happens, fam.

02:08.419 --> 02:09.462
"Ri-cos-il"?

02:10.421 --> 02:13.800
No. It's The Real Campers of Shallow Lake.

02:14.551 --> 02:19.139
The franchise I was always destined
to join. I mean, you were.

02:19.681 --> 02:20.723
EJ: Look, it's easy.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.143
You know how normally
we act like regular people,

02:23.268 --> 02:25.436
pick up on social cues,
care about our feelings?

02:25.520 --> 02:27.564
(LAUGHS) Do we?

02:28.356 --> 02:31.109
Yes, we do. But now that's over.

02:31.484 --> 02:34.904
Because the key to
any great reality show is the three Bs.

02:35.238 --> 02:37.574
Bombshells, betrayals and (BLEEP) slaps.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.200
(ALL GASP)

02:39.284 --> 02:40.368
Can he say that?

02:41.327 --> 02:43.538
Look, I love the housewives
as much as anyone,

02:43.621 --> 02:45.039
but how are we gonna pull this off

02:45.165 --> 02:49.252
when we're real students who don't have
millions to burn and kids to blame?

02:50.128 --> 02:52.755
-Can I be Team Kourtney on this?
-No. Here's what we're doing.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.094
There's the judgy one, the jilted ex,

02:58.678 --> 03:02.140
the one with the dark past, the crier,

03:02.473 --> 03:06.102
the one with the catchphrase,
the one who's here for the wrong reasons,

03:06.269 --> 03:09.063
the shrink, the bad boy
and the instigator.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.317
Mmm-hmm. It's a formula,
and the formula works.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.196
Each of you has a role to play today.

03:16.613 --> 03:20.491
-I'm sorry. Carlos, did you cast this?
-(CHUCKLES) I'm back, baby.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.161
Isn't this a little tawdry?

03:23.578 --> 03:24.954
Was gonna say the same thing.

03:25.788 --> 03:30.710
(CHUCKLES) And that's why you, Kourt,
get to be the judgy one.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.214
(ALL CLAPPING SOFTLY)

03:35.298 --> 03:39.302
But do we want to
look like villains on TV?

03:39.761 --> 03:44.474
I thought you'd want to go sympathetic,
which is why you get to be the jilted ex.

(ALL GASP)

03:46.476 --> 03:47.852

-Ashlyn, you've got a dark past.
-I'm dying. Yes.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.318
Guys, this is gonna be fun.

03:55.860 --> 03:57.403
Gadget, you're the crier.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.198
And, Gina...

04:00.281 --> 04:03.159
Ooh, I think we've already established
that I can't improvise.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.285
She's awful.

04:06.120 --> 04:10.500
I don't even have a comeback for that
because I can't improvise.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.920
I got you, boo.
You're the one with the catchphrase.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.924
Just say the same thing
all the time in different ways.

04:18.299 --> 04:20.009
Okay. What's my phrase?

04:21.177 --> 04:24.430
-"Don't get me started."
-And you shouldn't.

04:25.723 --> 04:28.935
EJ's here for the wrong reasons.
Val's the shrink,

04:29.978 --> 04:31.729
Jet's the bad boy,

04:32.772 --> 04:34.857
and I will be the instigator.

04:34.941 --> 04:38.152
(SCOFFS) I thought we were stretching
for these parts.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.572
Good. I want a lot of that today.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.701
I know that was a lot,
but has everyone got all that?

someone needs to get slapped,

04:58.131 --> 05:00.300
someone needs to throw a drink at someone,

05:00.425 --> 05:04.178
and someone needs to get caught on
a hot mic saying something scandalous.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.807
-Any questions?
-Many questions.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.729
This is gonna put our documentary
on the map. Get into it, guys.

05:12.812 --> 05:14.856
Um, Channing's coming in 15.

05:14.939 --> 05:18.318
Thanks, Val. Always helpful to get
your behind-the-scenes take.

-Same.

-I can hit him for real.
-CARLOS: Thank you. No. Safety first.

06:01.527 --> 06:04.197
Think of it as actors. Try this.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.116
EJ, you've stolen the woman Ricky loves.

06:07.617 --> 06:13.289
Do you mean Gina? Because she's
EJ's girlfriend, so he stole her.

06:13.623 --> 06:16.667
Would've stolen her. In a fake scenario.

06:17.960 --> 06:18.961
Yeah, I like it.

06:19.087 --> 06:22.673
You've held a torch for her for years
and sometimes in this fake scenario,

06:22.924 --> 06:24.926
you pretend to get lost
with her in the woods,

06:25.009 --> 06:28.262
and then now it's weird because
she's in love with me here at camp.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.060
-Mmm-hmm.
-Did I do it right?

06:34.936 --> 06:37.188
It's pretty convincing. Yeah?

06:38.314 --> 06:39.357
Found my motivation.

06:41.275 --> 06:42.318
Again?

06:44.821 --> 06:48.908
Okay. Is it just me or should Carlos
have given "fake crying" to an actor?

06:48.991 --> 06:51.828
Oh, it's way easier than you think.
Do you have a pet who died?

06:52.078 --> 06:53.955

There's no time.
Just work on your backstories.

Okay. Channing's on a ten-one.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.422
Gina, what's your motivation?

14:01.549 --> 14:03.425
Oh! I don't wanna get started.

14:03.717 --> 14:06.804
Yes, and you're angry at your boyfriend

14:06.887 --> 14:09.515

to get under his skin.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.684

the cracking voice, the eyes...

18:37.491 --> 18:42.454

Oh, right. Psych major. That's so amazing.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.633
From where I sit, Ricky is a perfect
example of sublimated yearning.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.389
And when we have to wait for
the kind of love we truly need,

19:00.639 --> 19:03.308

in unexpected ways.

about me and Madison

keeping things from me.

26:26.042 --> 26:30.630
-Huh, Rocket Man.
-(LAUGHS) Another thing I didn't know.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.800
I always assumed you were, like,
"Eric Junior."

26:34.342 --> 26:37.804
-My dad's name is Cash.
-That is on-brand.

26:37.887 --> 26:41.182
You guys. Jet and Maddox are siblings?

26:45.478 --> 26:48.356
Gina, please. I didn't... I just...

26:48.523 --> 26:50.525
You just acted like
an old version of yourself.

26:50.650 --> 26:54.321
I get it. Or maybe it's just
the real EJ of Shallow Lake.

27:10.545 --> 27:13.214
You overheard all of that in there,
didn't you?

27:14.132 --> 27:18.094
I am very confused, and I feel like
I need a nap. Except I'm too old for naps.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.889
Honestly, if that's
what theater kids are like...

27:20.972 --> 27:21.973
No.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.933
We think we should
try something lower stakes.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.435
Like Olympic speed skating.

27:25.685 --> 27:29.064
Look, we can be a lot,
but that's just who theater kids are.

27:29.272 --> 27:31.149
-At the end of the day we...
-Slap each other?

27:31.566 --> 27:33.109
(CHUCKLES) Only if we're paid to.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.613
Look, my mom sent me here
to get me out of my shell,

27:37.113 --> 27:39.449
but I understand why turtles
spend so much time inside.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.118
It's quiet inside.
And there are good snacks.

27:42.535 --> 27:46.081
I don't know anything about turtles.
The point is, you all are crazy.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.874
Trust me, it's worth it.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.671
Even when tensions get high
and you get, uh, low,

27:53.421 --> 27:55.423
you'll be proud of who you are
on opening night.

27:56.508 --> 27:58.551
-Your lip is trembling.
-I believe you.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.597
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)

28:08.603 --> 28:10.980
You always manage to find my hiding spots.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.983
I'm surprised you're
not hitchhiking home again.

28:14.651 --> 28:18.113
Dude, don't.
I would leave if I could.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.949
What are you running from?

28:22.575 --> 28:26.663
Let's just say Maddie doesn't think
I was playing a role today.

28:27.664 --> 28:30.667
I've been a bad guy to her for a long time
and it's eating me up.

28:31.626 --> 28:33.211
I don't know. It's hard to describe.

28:35.547 --> 28:40.885
It helps, sometimes when we can't find
the words, we just sing instead.

28:41.720 --> 28:45.807
-Who's we?
-Us. The theater kids.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.311
Yeah. Well, I'm not you.

28:59.195 --> 29:01.823
-Will he ever forgive me?
-Nah. This is about his sister.

29:04.075 --> 29:07.328
-And you killed it today, by the way.
-Thanks. You weren't too bad yourself.

29:07.662 --> 29:09.664
Jilted ex suits you, bro.

29:11.541 --> 29:14.836
Oh, no. I said "bro"
and now you're gonna reveal something.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.171
-Between us...
-Oh, dear.

29:16.755 --> 29:20.300
It's possible
I wasn't completely acting today

29:20.842 --> 29:24.596
when I was "pretending" to crush on Gina.

29:25.180 --> 29:27.766
-I was wondering.
-Did it show?

29:28.057 --> 29:31.811
My straight-dar is exquisite.
With one notable exception earlier.

29:32.937 --> 29:35.315
-Promise you won't tell.
-I'm no instigator.
