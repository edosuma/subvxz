but I got it.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.290
Love the decorations.

01:21.290 --> 01:25.250
And that is how
you cleanly slice a pumpkin.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.580
Ah!

01:29.330 --> 01:31.880
Sugar, cinnamon, honey.

01:51.710 --> 01:53.710
It's not like our relatives
are going anywhere.

01:55.250 --> 01:57.670

Wait. Where's Isabel?

04:12.380 --> 04:14.670
There you are.
We're ready to go.

04:14.670 --> 04:15.960
Hey, where's
your costume?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.790
Uh... it ripped when
I was putting it on.

04:18.790 --> 04:20.920
Oh, I'll have a seamstress
mend it right away.

04:20.920 --> 04:21.960
Is it up in your room?

04:21.960 --> 04:23.710
It's all right.
I'll do it myself.

04:23.710 --> 04:25.710
Okay. Well,
we'll wait for you.

04:25.710 --> 04:27.880
No! I mean...
you guys go on.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.250
I'll see you at
the graveyard later.

04:38.880 --> 04:41.290
Oh, wait a second.
Where the pan dulce?

04:41.290 --> 04:43.460
I gave it to
Francisco.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.290
That was for
the altar?

04:45.290 --> 04:47.120
I thought you were
giving me a snack.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.790
Likely story.

04:48.790 --> 04:51.170
Well, we need the pan dulce
for the altar.

04:51.170 --> 04:52.880
Sweet bread is
Mami's favorite.

04:52.880 --> 04:54.710
I'll send the servant
right away.

04:54.710 --> 04:56.500
That's okay.
I'll go pick some up.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.500
Hope you like
your altar, abuelo.

05:01.620 --> 05:03.120
Oh, mija, I love it.

05:03.120 --> 05:06.750
Look at that handsome devil.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.210
But... that's you.

05:09.210 --> 05:10.710
You can see me?

05:11.920 --> 05:13.330
Yes.

05:13.330 --> 05:16.290
Huh. Can you see
the other ghosts?

05:16.290 --> 05:17.790
Ghosts?

05:17.790 --> 05:20.830
Oh, Rogelio, you are
so light on your feet.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.620
And she left him
at the altar!

05:24.920 --> 05:26.540
That one never
gets old!

05:26.540 --> 05:30.170
Okay, seeing ghosts,
not normal.

05:30.170 --> 05:32.080
I better talk
to Zuzo.

05:32.080 --> 05:33.920
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.170
Pardon me.

05:39.080 --> 05:40.750
Zuzo?

05:40.750 --> 05:43.250
Zuzo! Zuzo!!

05:43.250 --> 05:45.380
Hey, princess.
Were you calling me?

05:45.380 --> 05:47.540
It was hard to hear
over all the singing.

05:47.540 --> 05:49.710
You celebrate
Day of the Dead, too?

05:49.710 --> 05:52.040
Yeah, it's a big deal
in the spirit world.

05:52.040 --> 05:54.580
You know, 'cause of
all the spirits.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.750
The party's gonna be
pretty epic.
So what's up?

05:56.750 --> 06:00.290
It seems I can suddenly
see ghosts?

06:00.290 --> 06:03.290
Hey, that's great.
So can I!

06:03.290 --> 06:06.880
But you're a spirit fox,
and I'm just an ordinary person.

06:06.880 --> 06:09.210
Well, you did spend
a bunch of years

06:09.210 --> 06:11.790
in that amulet,
just marinating in magic.

06:11.790 --> 06:13.750
You can see me.

06:13.750 --> 06:16.620
So I can see ghosts
now, too?

06:16.620 --> 06:18.960
Hm. Probably only today.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.830
Why just today?

06:20.830 --> 06:22.830
'Cause this is
the one day of the year

06:22.830 --> 06:24.830
ghosts come to party
with the living.

06:24.830 --> 06:26.500
Speaking of parties,

06:26.500 --> 06:28.750
I've got a conga line
to lead.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.540
Enjoy your new power,
princess.

06:35.460 --> 06:37.880
I thought that pesky fox
would never leave.

06:37.880 --> 06:39.880
Uh, excuse me.

06:39.880 --> 06:41.880
Oh. Sorry, princesa.

06:41.880 --> 06:43.750
When you saw me
at the cemetery,

06:43.750 --> 06:46.580
I knew you were
the only one who could help me.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.710
Help you?
With what?

06:48.710 --> 06:51.540
My name is Doña Angelica.

06:51.540 --> 06:52.750
In this very day,

06:52.750 --> 06:55.080
my grandchildren
are preparing to sell

06:55.080 --> 06:58.290
the family restaurant
to a vile, greedy man

06:58.290 --> 07:01.170
who wants to open
a bank!

07:01.170 --> 07:03.750
And you need my help how?

07:03.750 --> 07:05.750
You must stop them
from selling it.

07:05.750 --> 07:08.500
People used to line up
around the block

07:08.500 --> 07:10.830
just to eat at
Cafe Angelica.

07:10.830 --> 07:12.420
It is my legacy.

07:12.420 --> 07:14.620
Go to the restaurant,
tell my grandchildren

07:14.620 --> 07:17.330
not to break
their dear abuela's heart.

07:17.330 --> 07:21.540
So you want me to convince
two complete strangers

07:21.540 --> 07:25.750
to not sell their restaurant
because their grandmother's
ghost told me to?

07:25.750 --> 07:27.620
I did not say
it would be easy.

07:27.620 --> 07:29.620
But yes, this is
what I ask.

07:29.620 --> 07:32.120
I really wanna help you,
doña,

07:32.120 --> 07:34.750
but my family is waiting
for me to pick up pan dulce.

07:34.750 --> 07:38.380
You're so sweet
to honor your family.

07:38.380 --> 07:41.000
Mine is not building
an altar today.

07:41.000 --> 07:45.960
Instead, they are selling
my dreams to the highest bidder.

07:47.790 --> 07:49.960
Okay, um...
I suppose I could
probably...

07:49.960 --> 07:51.880
- Excellent.
- ...stop by.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.920
It's just
down the street.

07:53.920 --> 07:54.920
Tell your driver.
We don't have much time.

07:59.880 --> 08:03.620
Ay, Carmen, we are
selling the restaurant today.

08:03.620 --> 08:04.960
Why aren't you packing?

08:04.960 --> 08:07.880
I am a cook, Julio,
and cooks cook.

08:07.880 --> 08:09.250
But what is the point?

08:09.250 --> 08:11.170
We don't have
any customers.

08:11.170 --> 08:13.250
- As usual.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.750
Ah, you were saying?

08:17.830 --> 08:19.830
Hi there.
Table for two.

08:19.830 --> 08:21.580
- They can't see me.
- I mean one.

08:22.790 --> 08:25.080
I'm sorry.
We are closed.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.960
- Princess Elena!

08:26.960 --> 08:28.790
We are so honored to
have you in our restaurant.

08:28.790 --> 08:31.080
Please sit, sit.

08:31.080 --> 08:34.290
I just made a feast
fit for a princess.

08:36.540 --> 08:38.290
Quick, run.
Save yourself.

08:38.290 --> 08:39.580
What

08:39.580 --> 08:41.170
Trust me,
you don't want to--

08:41.170 --> 08:42.750
- CARMEN: Here we are!
- Too late.

08:42.750 --> 08:43.880
Hope you're hungry!

08:43.880 --> 08:46.620
Allow me to present
my latest creation.

08:46.620 --> 08:48.830
The cray-tada!

08:48.830 --> 08:51.750
I mean, yum.

08:51.750 --> 08:53.920
You mean yuck.
Ay-yi-yi.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.460
Yeah, um, I had
a big breakfast,

08:55.460 --> 08:57.330
so I'm not
very hungry.

08:57.330 --> 09:01.710
You see, Carmen? This is why
we're selling the restaurant.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.670
Nobody wants
to eat your food.

09:03.670 --> 09:06.040
And no wonder.
Look what she's serving.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.000
I swear, it looks like
he's staring at me

09:08.000 --> 09:09.830
no matter where I float.

09:09.830 --> 09:11.750
I'm an artist, Julio.

09:11.750 --> 09:14.420
The plate is my canvas,
the food, my paints.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.540
Sometimes it does
taste like paint.

09:17.540 --> 09:18.960
The truth is, Carmen,

09:18.960 --> 09:20.830
you're just
not a good cook.

09:20.830 --> 09:22.210
Yes, I am.

09:22.210 --> 09:24.170
She is.

09:24.170 --> 09:26.330
Carmen used to help me
cook all my food,

09:26.330 --> 09:28.380
and it always
turned out delicious.

09:28.380 --> 09:30.170
Your cray-tada
did bite me.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.830
I have an idea.

09:31.830 --> 09:33.710
Why don't you try
cooking your grandmother's food?

09:33.710 --> 09:35.120
I heard it was
pretty popular.

09:35.120 --> 09:38.790
I would, but she never
gave us her recipes.

09:38.790 --> 09:40.960
Our grandmother had
a secret cookbook.

09:40.960 --> 09:43.170
I looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find it.

09:43.170 --> 09:45.710
Oh, that's right.
I forgot to tell them
where I hid it.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.540
So tell me
where you hid it.

09:47.540 --> 09:49.290
I'll give the cookbook
to Carmen,

09:49.290 --> 09:51.000
she'll cook
your recipes,

09:51.000 --> 09:52.830
the customers
will come back,

09:52.830 --> 09:55.170
and they won't have
to sell the restaurant.

09:55.170 --> 09:56.880
Who is she talking to?

09:56.880 --> 09:57.960
Uh, the cray

09:57.960 --> 10:00.790
There's only
one problem.

10:00.790 --> 10:02.830
- I forgot
where I hid it.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.540
Uh, Your Majesty,
who are you talking to?

10:07.580 --> 10:10.120
Oh, well, I know it might
sound a little out there,

10:10.120 --> 10:13.380
but I'm talking to
your grandmother.

10:14.880 --> 10:16.460
Are you feeling
all right?

10:16.460 --> 10:18.250
Perhaps the princess
is tired?

10:18.250 --> 10:21.750
No, really, I'm talking
to your grandmother.

10:21.750 --> 10:23.830
But she's not
with us anymore.

10:23.830 --> 10:26.120
I know. Um...

10:26.120 --> 10:27.880
The thing is,

10:27.880 --> 10:30.500
well, I can see ghosts.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.790
Ghosts? That's...

10:32.790 --> 10:34.620
Amazing.

10:34.620 --> 10:35.710
Not the word I was
going to use, no.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.750
Hi, abuelita.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.120
She's over there.

10:39.120 --> 10:42.250
- Hi, abuelita.
- Aww.

10:42.250 --> 10:44.920
Your grandmother wants to
show you where she hid
her cookbook.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.920
- If she can remember
where she hid it.

10:47.920 --> 10:49.880
Your Majesty,
with all due respect,

10:49.880 --> 10:51.830
I do not believe
in ghosts

10:51.830 --> 10:53.920
But if there's any chance
you know where the cookbook is,

10:53.920 --> 10:56.290
by all means,
lead the way.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.920
Wait. I remember.
It's in my old bedroom.

10:58.920 --> 11:00.540
It's in her bedroom.

11:00.540 --> 11:03.170
- No, it's in the kitchen.
- The kitchen.

11:03.170 --> 11:05.380
Oh, I mean the attic.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.580
The attic.

11:08.750 --> 11:10.830
It's in the basement
of the restaurant.

11:10.830 --> 11:13.960
In the basement...
I hope.

11:13.960 --> 11:17.500
Follow me.
It's in the box
in the corner.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.120
She says it's in there.
Oh!

11:23.500 --> 11:25.040
You sure she said
this box?

11:25.040 --> 11:26.790
I thought that's
where I put it.

11:26.790 --> 11:28.380
Well, princess,
it looks like

11:28.380 --> 11:30.170
your ghost was wrong.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.460
Maybe abuela hid her cookbook
in another box.

11:32.460 --> 11:34.040
She was always
a little forgetful.

11:34.040 --> 11:35.500
No, I wasn't.

11:35.500 --> 11:36.880
Was I? I forget.

11:36.880 --> 11:38.830
Maybe it's in
one of the other boxes.

11:38.830 --> 11:41.420
She says to check
the other boxes.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.710
Ay, we do not have
time for this.

11:45.710 --> 11:48.120
Our buyer is coming
in two hours.

11:48.120 --> 11:49.880
Then what are you waiting for?
Help me look.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.920
Hey, remember these?

11:53.920 --> 11:56.460
Sir Rolando!

11:56.460 --> 11:58.500
He used to
run around the restaurant

11:58.500 --> 12:01.000
pretending he was the bravest
knight in the kingdom.

12:01.000 --> 12:02.880
Trying to get the customers
to joust with him.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.750
Remember that, Julio?

12:04.750 --> 12:08.580
I remember playing
hide-and-seek with him

12:08.580 --> 12:10.290
during the dinner rush.

12:14.750 --> 12:17.040
Carmen, this is not
a playground.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.290
Gotcha!

12:23.290 --> 12:26.040
You always find me.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.670
Why can't I ever find you?

12:27.670 --> 12:29.710
'Cause I hide
better than you do.

12:29.710 --> 12:32.710
Oh, yeah? Well,
I'm gonna hide Sir Rolando

12:32.710 --> 12:33.750
where you'll
never find him.

12:33.750 --> 12:35.920
No, give him back.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.750
Dinnertime.

12:39.750 --> 12:41.830
- I'm starving.
- Me, too.

12:44.880 --> 12:46.670
BOTH: Thanks, abuelita.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.330
Whenever we argued,
abuelita would feed us.

12:52.330 --> 12:56.540
They'd be too happy eating
to stay angry at each other.

12:56.540 --> 12:59.460
Come to think of it,
I never did find Julio.

12:59.460 --> 13:01.500
Where was your hiding place?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.500
I guess I can
tell you now.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.880
I hid in that nook
in the back of the pantry.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.120
The nook!

13:07.120 --> 13:08.920
That's where I hid
my cookbook.

13:08.920 --> 13:10.290
- Of course I'm sure.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.750
I was talking to
your grandmother.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.540
I think so.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.880
Down there,
behind the sacks.

13:24.670 --> 13:25.710
You found it!

13:25.710 --> 13:28.500
My cookbook!

13:28.500 --> 13:30.250
Here you go.

13:30.250 --> 13:33.290
Now I can cook all of
abuelita's famous recipes.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.080
And I can't wait
to try them.

13:35.080 --> 13:36.750
But right now, I'd better
pick up the pan dulce

13:36.750 --> 13:38.920
and get back to
the cemetery.

13:38.920 --> 13:40.920
My family's probably
wondering where I am.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.790
Thank you.

13:42.790 --> 13:45.250
Julio, we don't have to sell
the restaurant now.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.670
Oh, we're still selling
the restaurant.

13:47.670 --> 13:50.500
- Carmen, I love you,

13:50.500 --> 13:52.000
but even with
abuelita's recipes,

13:52.000 --> 13:53.710
I just don't think
you're a good enough cook.

13:53.710 --> 13:56.540
However, I do think
if we sell the restaurant,

13:56.540 --> 14:00.000
and the cookbook,
we can make even more money.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.670
Okay, so maybe no one
likes my recipes,

14:02.670 --> 14:04.000
but they love abuelita's,

14:04.000 --> 14:06.290
and I can cook anything
if I have the recipe.

14:06.290 --> 14:07.750
Just give me a chance.

14:07.750 --> 14:10.750
I have given you a chance
for five years.

14:10.750 --> 14:13.790
All I have gotten
are stomachaches and
bills we can't pay.

14:13.790 --> 14:15.750
I will prove
I can cook.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.000
- Give that back, Carmen.
- No!

14:20.920 --> 14:22.880
Okay, okay, how about
both of you

14:22.880 --> 14:25.080
put the cookbook down,

14:25.080 --> 14:27.080
and we'll all
talk this through?

14:29.580 --> 14:31.790
Oh, my cookbook!

14:31.790 --> 14:33.290
Carmen, look
what you did.

14:33.290 --> 14:34.750
What I did?
You mean what you did.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.880
Sell the restaurant,
I don't care.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.750
At least I'll never have
to talk to you again,

14:38.750 --> 14:41.380
Julio Osvaldo
Valentino Guzman.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.580
I gladly welcome
the peace and quiet,

14:43.580 --> 14:46.170
Carmen Rosa
Guadalupe Guzman.

14:49.290 --> 14:52.380
Thank you, princesa,
for trying to help.

14:52.380 --> 14:55.080
All I wanted to do
was save my restaurant.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.830
But I lost my family.

15:00.880 --> 15:03.830
What are you looking at?

15:03.830 --> 15:05.380
I tried.

15:05.380 --> 15:07.000
Hmm.

15:08.080 --> 15:09.710
Whenever they argued,

15:09.710 --> 15:12.210
Doña Angelica
would cook for them.

15:12.210 --> 15:13.750
That's it.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.500
Carmen, did you see
which way your grandmother went?

15:20.500 --> 15:22.170
Oh, no, of course
you didn't.

15:22.170 --> 15:24.380
She's a ghost.
I'll be right back.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.790
Doña Angelica, wait.

15:29.790 --> 15:32.250
I know how to fix things
between Julio and Carmen,

15:32.250 --> 15:34.040
and save the restaurant.

15:34.040 --> 15:36.540
How?
- Come with me.

15:38.920 --> 15:42.170
Carmen, remember how
your abuela's food

15:42.170 --> 15:44.540
used to bring
you and Julio together?

15:44.540 --> 15:46.880
You can still make
her recipes and prove to him

15:46.880 --> 15:48.920
that you are a good cook.

15:48.920 --> 15:50.790
Then he won't
have to sell the restaurant.

15:50.790 --> 15:52.920
How

15:52.920 --> 15:55.120
Yes, but your abuela
is right here.

15:55.120 --> 15:58.250
She can tell me the recipe,
and I can tell you.

15:58.250 --> 15:59.790
So what do you say?

15:59.790 --> 16:02.580
I say what are we doing
out here

16:02.580 --> 16:04.080
when the kitchen is in there?

16:04.080 --> 16:05.750
Let's get cookin'!

16:09.710 --> 16:12.500
Okay, now whisk
the sofrito into the stock.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.750
She wants us to add
the sofrito.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.120
Whisk in sofrito.
Mix it in well.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.750
Put your heart
into it.

16:18.750 --> 16:20.960
She said to put
your heart into it.

16:20.960 --> 16:22.960
Oh, she always said that.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.540
I miss cooking with you,
abuelita.

16:24.540 --> 16:27.790
Me, too, but I am
always with you

16:27.790 --> 16:29.920
in your memories.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.790
She says she's always
with you in your memories.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.420
It's true.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.750
Go away!

16:42.750 --> 16:44.920
What are we doing?
Julio's so stubborn.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.670
Here. I have an idea.

16:49.250 --> 16:51.710
Three, two, one.

16:53.960 --> 16:55.920
Dinner is served.

16:55.920 --> 16:57.750
It's... it couldn't be.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.710
It's abuelita's paella.

16:59.710 --> 17:01.880
But the cookbook's gone.

17:01.880 --> 17:02.960
She told me
how to make it,

17:02.960 --> 17:05.170
and her molé
and pozole.

17:05.170 --> 17:07.790
I have all
her recipes now.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.620
Try some.

17:12.500 --> 17:15.920
Mmm. It's just how
she used to make it.

17:15.920 --> 17:16.960
She's really here.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.540
Hi, abuelita!

17:18.540 --> 17:20.000
Over there.

17:20.000 --> 17:23.170
Abuelita, I missed you.

17:23.170 --> 17:25.000
And you... I was wrong, Carmen.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.750
You are a great cook.

17:27.750 --> 17:29.960
Ay, it's so beautiful.

17:29.960 --> 17:31.500
But the food is getting cold.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.330
Carmen, I'm sorry
we argued.

17:34.330 --> 17:36.290
- Me, too.
- Let's eat!

17:38.420 --> 17:41.710
Oh, Señor Estrada,
yes, good evening.

17:41.710 --> 17:44.080
Yes, yes, let's just
skip the niceties.

17:44.080 --> 17:46.080
Where's the contract?
I've got a bank to open.

17:46.080 --> 17:48.750
This place will finally
have some money coming in, eh?

17:48.750 --> 17:51.460
Uh, Your Majesty.

17:51.460 --> 17:52.880
You're right,
Señor Estrada.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.460
This place will finally
be making money,

17:55.460 --> 17:59.920
because we have the best chef
cooking the best food in town.

17:59.920 --> 18:03.120
I'm sorry, but this restaurant
is no longer for sale.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.960
We're really
keeping it, Julio?

18:04.960 --> 18:08.080
Yes, Carmen.

18:08.080 --> 18:09.880
Do you mean to tell me

18:09.880 --> 18:10.920
I came all this way
for nothing?

18:10.920 --> 18:13.460
No, not nothing.
Please join us.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.620
I don't have time...

18:15.620 --> 18:17.580
Mmm. Paella!

18:17.580 --> 18:19.000
The best in
the kingdom.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.080
Sit, eat.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.960
Then go tell everyone
you know

18:22.960 --> 18:25.710
Cafe Angelica is open
for business once more.

18:25.710 --> 18:28.210
Well, now that everything
is sorted out,

18:28.210 --> 18:30.290
I better head back
to the cemetery.

18:30.290 --> 18:32.380
Wait. I've got
something for you.

18:32.380 --> 18:34.790
Thank you for all
that you've done, Elena.

18:34.790 --> 18:37.500
Please, Your Majesty,
come back and visit us soon.

18:37.500 --> 18:39.290
I will.

18:39.290 --> 18:41.290
I made pan dulce
for your parents' altar.

18:41.290 --> 18:43.210
Don't worry, it's
my abuelita's recipe.

18:43.210 --> 18:45.420
Thank you.
Both of you.

18:49.710 --> 18:52.960
There you are. We were
about to eat dinner.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.170
Here. Let me
serve you a plate.

18:55.170 --> 18:56.710
Where is Isabel?

18:56.710 --> 18:58.460
She hasn't come yet?

18:58.460 --> 19:00.040
You were taking so long,

19:00.040 --> 19:01.880
we thought you went
to get her.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.670
No.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.540
I will send a royal guard
to fetch her...

19:05.540 --> 19:07.250
or she can do it.

19:09.380 --> 19:12.210
ELENA: Isa

19:13.380 --> 19:15.830
- Come in.

19:15.830 --> 19:17.420
What are you
doing here?

19:17.420 --> 19:19.170
Sketching.

19:19.170 --> 19:20.750
Why aren't you at
the celebration?

19:20.750 --> 19:22.960
You're missing out
on all the fun.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.920
I couldn't fix
my costume,

19:24.920 --> 19:27.790
so I decided
to stay home.
What's in the bag?

19:27.790 --> 19:29.540
Pan dulce.

19:29.540 --> 19:31.830
- I guess so.

19:34.750 --> 19:37.420
Mm. It's almost
as good as Mami's.

19:37.420 --> 19:38.580
Almost.

19:41.420 --> 19:44.330
Hey, do you remember how
Mami used to read us
bedtime stories?

19:44.330 --> 19:46.120
Uh-huh.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.420
And she acted out
all the parts.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.210
With all those
funny voices.

19:49.210 --> 19:53.960
And Papi would come in and play
Wild Wild Seas, remember?

19:53.960 --> 19:58.250
And he's jump on the bed
so the mattress rocked
like a ship in a stormy sea.

19:58.250 --> 20:01.880
And then Papi would
spin me around.

20:01.880 --> 20:03.880
Like this.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.920
And then he'd scream...

20:05.920 --> 20:07.500
BOTH: Girl overboard!

20:11.290 --> 20:16.710
Isabel, this is a great drawing
of Mami and Papi.

20:16.710 --> 20:19.790
They would've loved this.
We should put it on their altar.

20:19.790 --> 20:21.960
But my costume.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.120
I can sew that up
in a second.

20:24.120 --> 20:25.670
Where is it?

20:29.080 --> 20:31.120
Isa, your costume's fine.

20:31.120 --> 20:33.420
What's going on?

20:33.420 --> 20:35.710
I don't wanna go
to the graveyard.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.540
Why not?

20:37.540 --> 20:40.620
I miss Mami and Papi
too much.

20:40.620 --> 20:42.670
I know.

20:42.670 --> 20:44.710
I miss them, too.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.420
But that's why we have
the celebration every year,

20:47.420 --> 20:50.250
so we can talk about
all the good times
we had together.

20:50.250 --> 20:53.830
Like reading stories
and jumping on the bed.

20:53.830 --> 20:56.120
Because if we keep
those memories alive,

20:56.120 --> 20:58.080
it's like they're
always with us,

20:58.080 --> 21:00.750
and that doesn't
make me sad.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.460
It makes me happy.

21:02.460 --> 21:04.790
I never thought about it
like that.

21:04.790 --> 21:07.920
Do you think we can
still make it in time?

21:07.920 --> 21:10.380
If you hurry.

21:15.960 --> 21:17.580
Oh, look.

21:17.580 --> 21:19.120
The procession
is just starting.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.790
Great!

21:20.790 --> 21:23.170
- Elena!
- Isabel!

21:23.170 --> 21:26.830
Come on, let's put your
sketch and pan dulce
on the altar.

21:26.830 --> 21:28.710
Well, what's left of it.

21:31.170 --> 21:33.460
There you go,
Mami, Papi.

21:37.290 --> 21:41.710
Elena, I really feel like
Mami and Papi are here with us.

21:41.710 --> 21:43.420
Does that sound weird?

21:48.210 --> 21:50.830
No.

21:50.830 --> 21:52.790
I know they are.
