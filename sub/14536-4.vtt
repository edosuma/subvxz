WEBVTT

00:02.602 --> 00:03.718
<i>Previously...</i>

00:03.754 --> 00:05.854
Is this the Cooper residence?

00:05.889 --> 00:07.247
I'm actually here
for Kira Cooper.

00:07.282 --> 00:08.473
I think she might be
my mother's sister.

00:08.508 --> 00:11.435
If she is anything like her
mother, that girl is no good.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.361
Wait, wait.

00:13.396 --> 00:15.013
Your sister joined
the Other Side?

00:15.049 --> 00:17.591
I'm sorry. I didn't get to
properly introduce myself before.

00:17.626 --> 00:19.984
I'm KC Cooper,

00:20.020 --> 00:22.521
- and I'm your cousin.
- Come on in.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.607
You could be putting us
all in danger with that girl.

00:25.642 --> 00:27.275
That girl is your niece.

00:27.311 --> 00:28.935
So she says.

00:28.971 --> 00:30.403
What happened to your sister?

00:30.438 --> 00:31.913
For the millionth time,

00:31.949 --> 00:34.232
I don't know, Agent Johnson.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.725
I've never known, Agent Johnson.

00:35.760 --> 00:37.777
But if I find out,

00:37.813 --> 00:39.538
I'll let you know,
Agent Johnson!

00:39.573 --> 00:42.082
What a beautiful locket.

00:42.117 --> 00:44.017
We figured that since
your mom's gone,

00:44.052 --> 00:46.161
this would be
the next best thing.

00:46.196 --> 00:48.655
I'm actually looking at
my mother's face.

00:48.690 --> 00:51.792
Abby...

00:51.827 --> 00:53.961
She's not gone.

00:53.996 --> 00:55.712
I'm sorry. What?

00:55.748 --> 00:57.948
- She's alive.
- What?

00:57.983 --> 00:59.983
She's alive,
and I know where she is.

01:10.253 --> 01:12.354
Mom. Mom, wake up.

01:12.389 --> 01:14.923
Freeze, dirtbag!

01:14.958 --> 01:16.992
KC, it's the middle
of the night.

01:17.027 --> 01:18.134
What are you doing up?

01:18.170 --> 01:20.629
I can't sleep, okay?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.514
And I've been thinking

01:22.549 --> 01:23.840
we need to take Abby
to meet her mom.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.169
What?! No! Absolutely not.

01:27.171 --> 01:28.628
A mother and daughter
should not be apart like that.

01:28.664 --> 01:30.471
That's so sad.

01:30.507 --> 01:31.564
Could you imagine
if we were separated?

01:31.599 --> 01:34.934
I wish we were separated.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.119
So why don't you
go back to your room,

01:36.154 --> 01:37.771
and I'll go back to sleep.

01:37.806 --> 01:39.864
No, Mom, I'm serious.

01:39.899 --> 01:41.116
We have to do this for Abby,

01:41.151 --> 01:42.775
and don't you miss
Erica a little bit?

01:42.811 --> 01:45.345
- No, I don't.
- I don't believe you.

01:45.380 --> 01:48.231
She's your sister,
and that means something.

01:48.266 --> 01:50.116
Siblings have a bond for life.

01:50.152 --> 01:51.568
What are you guys doing up?

01:51.603 --> 01:53.483
None of your business. Get out.

01:54.923 --> 01:57.766
Honey, we just got back
into the Organization.

01:57.801 --> 01:59.326
Do you know what they'd do to us

01:59.361 --> 02:01.043
if Abby found out we're spies?

02:01.079 --> 02:02.320
What your father might do?

02:02.356 --> 02:03.814
They don't have to know.

02:03.849 --> 02:05.807
Erica is in the Caribbean.

02:05.842 --> 02:07.317
How are we gonna get her
all the way down there

02:07.352 --> 02:09.086
without her finding
out the truth?

02:09.121 --> 02:11.296
I don't know yet,
but I'll figure it out.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.332
Okay, please.

02:16.678 --> 02:19.179
All right, fine. We'll do it.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.022
- Thanks, Mom.
- All right, now get out of here.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.557
I got a big mission
in the morning.

02:22.592 --> 02:24.552
- I gotta get some sleep.
- Good night.

02:26.846 --> 02:30.615
( Alarm clock beeping )

02:30.651 --> 02:32.451
Wakey-wakey. Eggs and bac-y.

02:37.165 --> 02:39.132
¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶

02:39.167 --> 02:42.327
¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶

02:42.329 --> 02:45.497
¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep things hustle cool ¶

02:45.532 --> 02:50.301
¶ I'll always find a way,
a way out of the fire ¶

02:50.337 --> 02:54.005
¶ Don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶

02:54.040 --> 02:56.099
¶ I'm not perfect ¶

02:56.135 --> 03:00.170
¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶

03:00.205 --> 03:04.190
¶ But I, I, I,
I keep it undercover ¶

03:04.226 --> 03:06.217
¶ Livin' my life,
no way to learn ¶

03:06.252 --> 03:08.495
¶ Doin' my thing,
gonna make it work ¶

03:08.530 --> 03:10.972
¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby, I'm fearless ¶

03:11.008 --> 03:13.083
¶ But I always got your back ¶

03:13.118 --> 03:14.968
¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶

03:15.003 --> 03:17.212
¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶

03:17.247 --> 03:19.848
¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶

03:19.883 --> 03:20.949
¶ It's all part of the plan ¶

03:20.984 --> 03:23.310
I keep it undercover.

03:23.345 --> 03:24.945
I keep it undercover.

03:27.432 --> 03:29.658
And this is from
our family vacation in Miami

03:29.693 --> 03:31.293
two years ago.

03:31.328 --> 03:34.029
Well, I've been dying
to get to know this family,

03:34.064 --> 03:35.872
and 4,300 pictures later,

03:35.908 --> 03:38.408
I feel like I really know ya.

03:38.443 --> 03:40.523
4,301. Everyone smile!

03:43.740 --> 03:45.040
Hey, Abby, can I get you
some more iced tea?

03:45.075 --> 03:47.125
No, thanks. I'm fine.

03:47.161 --> 03:49.677
A relative that doesn't
want anything from me?

03:49.712 --> 03:51.846
Oh, she's a keeper.
Welcome to the family.

03:54.934 --> 03:56.935
Speaking of which, Abby,

03:56.971 --> 03:59.071
I just wanna put it out there.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.614
Since we're cousins,
absolutely nothing romantic

04:01.649 --> 04:03.791
can happen between us.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.477
I'm officially off limits.

04:06.513 --> 04:09.714
( Scoffs ) Off limits
and off your rocker.

04:09.750 --> 04:12.200
Just setting boundaries
so no hearts get broken.

04:14.888 --> 04:17.630
Ernie is everything
you said he is.

04:17.665 --> 04:20.158
I know. I'm sorry.

04:20.193 --> 04:23.803
So I have a surprise
for you girls.

04:23.838 --> 04:25.906
I am taking the three of us

04:25.941 --> 04:30.143
to the Robair Lottair Spa
in Virginia Beach this weekend.

04:30.178 --> 04:32.078
For real? That sounds great.

04:32.114 --> 04:35.048
Ooh! A spa weekend.

04:35.083 --> 04:38.251
I can't wait to get
my pamper on.

04:38.286 --> 04:40.126
Okay, Ernie, let's go
pick up the Chinese food.

04:43.000 --> 04:44.866
Wasn't that weird?

04:44.901 --> 04:46.785
KC being excited about a spa?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.695
What's weird about that?

04:48.731 --> 04:51.063
She hates that kind of stuff.

04:51.099 --> 04:53.191
Have you ever seen her
get her nails done?

04:53.227 --> 04:55.467
It's like watching
a dog at the groomer's.

04:57.489 --> 05:00.190
I think they're up to something.

05:00.225 --> 05:02.925
Ernie, you know what
you don't know about women?

05:02.961 --> 05:05.153
Everything.

05:05.189 --> 05:07.080
All women like spas.

05:07.115 --> 05:09.908
Trust me, there is
nothing going on.

05:09.943 --> 05:13.161
All right, here's
what's going on.

05:13.196 --> 05:15.121
We're not actually
taking you to a spa, okay?

05:15.156 --> 05:16.640
We're taking you
to meet your mom.

05:16.675 --> 05:19.843
Are you serious?

05:19.878 --> 05:22.670
Is this really happening?

05:22.705 --> 05:25.140
I don't know what to say.

05:25.175 --> 05:28.093
Well, you could start by saying,

05:28.128 --> 05:29.427
"KC, you are the best
cousin in the world,"

05:29.462 --> 05:30.579
but that is just
a jumping-off point.

05:30.614 --> 05:33.289
Really, anything to express
what a great cousin I am,

05:33.324 --> 05:34.741
works perfectly fine.

05:34.776 --> 05:38.912
Actually, Abby, Craig and
Ernie can't know about this.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.297
In fact, nobody can know
what we're up to.

05:41.333 --> 05:43.283
You got it.

05:43.318 --> 05:45.142
You have nothing to worry about.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.044
I'm great at keeping secrets.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.321
Sir!

05:48.356 --> 05:50.139
This is exactly what
we've been waiting for.

05:50.174 --> 05:52.567
By this time tomorrow,

05:52.603 --> 05:54.627
we'll have the location
of Kira's sister Erica.

05:54.663 --> 05:58.006
And Erica is the key
to finally finding out

05:58.041 --> 06:00.725
who the head of
the Other Side is.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.197
We are breaking, like,
a million rules

06:06.232 --> 06:08.149
taking Abby to Erica.

06:08.185 --> 06:10.009
So whatever happens, remember,

06:10.044 --> 06:11.402
we can't let her know
we're spies.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.917
I promise, she's not
gonna know anything.

06:16.184 --> 06:17.609
There's my partner in crime,
and by crime,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.185
I mean shopping!

06:19.220 --> 06:22.121
Girl, the way you shop
is a crime.

06:22.156 --> 06:23.715
But I can't. I have
a spa weekend planned.

06:23.750 --> 06:25.500
A spa weekend? I would love...

06:25.535 --> 06:29.061
- No, you can't come.
- Family only and you're not family!

06:29.097 --> 06:32.323
Whoa. You guys do need
to chill out.

06:32.358 --> 06:33.692
Good thing you're
going to a spa.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.244
( Forced laughter )

06:36.279 --> 06:37.437
MARISA: Speaking of spas,

06:37.472 --> 06:40.273
have you ever seen the video
of those Japanese spas

06:40.308 --> 06:43.142
with the fish that eat
the dead skin off your feet?

06:43.177 --> 06:45.378
I wish I could have
some of those as pets.

06:45.413 --> 06:47.272
Would I have to
actually feed them,

06:47.307 --> 06:48.732
or could I just
stick my feet in the tank?

06:48.767 --> 06:52.018
I wonder if they have those fish
at the spa you're going to.

06:52.053 --> 06:53.895
Well, I guess I will never know,

06:53.930 --> 06:55.805
because clearly,
I'm not welcome.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.365
So much for
the more the merrier.

06:57.400 --> 06:58.583
Oh, cheer up.

06:58.619 --> 07:02.062
You!

07:02.097 --> 07:05.424
I think it's time for us
to go to the spa now.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.767
KC will see you when
she gets back from the spa,

07:07.803 --> 07:09.411
where she'll be all weekend.

07:09.446 --> 07:11.771
Just the spa, and nowhere else.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.807
Okay, bye.

07:13.842 --> 07:15.682
KC will call you from the spa!

07:17.070 --> 07:19.204
Why did you do that? Why didn't
you just destroy the bug?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.748
Because whoever planted it
there would know we found it.

07:21.783 --> 07:25.043
I'm guessing it's the Other
Side who's looking for Erica.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.453
Or it's the Organization
and they're on to us,

07:26.488 --> 07:28.154
and they planted it.

07:28.189 --> 07:29.547
Either way,
we gotta cancel this trip.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.140
No! Mom, this may be

07:31.176 --> 07:33.593
the only chance that Abby
has to meet her mother. Please.

07:33.628 --> 07:38.197
And how do you suggest that
we avoid being followed, KC?

07:38.233 --> 07:40.341
Well, you put the bug on Marisa.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.136
That should buy us some time.

07:43.172 --> 07:45.313
Plus, I mean, talking to
her makes my head spin.

07:45.348 --> 07:47.188
I can only imagine what
she's gonna do to them.

07:51.505 --> 07:55.207
So I figured, if they can
get pampered without me,

07:55.242 --> 07:57.893
I can get pampered without them.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.285
Besides, my mom has had
this spa gift certificate

07:59.321 --> 08:00.670
for almost a week.

08:00.706 --> 08:03.473
If she hasn't used it by now,
she will never miss it.

08:05.752 --> 08:08.752
I've really missed you. It feels
like years since I've seen you.

08:10.332 --> 08:12.465
Sir, uh...

08:12.500 --> 08:14.216
I just heard Kira Cooper
talking to her sister.

08:14.252 --> 08:15.368
Should we engage?

08:15.403 --> 08:16.962
No, no, keep listening.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.063
If we go in too soon,

08:19.099 --> 08:19.898
it could scare the sister
back into hiding.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.642
<i>While I'm here,</i>

08:22.677 --> 08:24.527
I could use a makeover.

08:24.562 --> 08:26.071
I was thinking a whole new face.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.298
(callus remover whirring )

08:29.334 --> 08:31.743
Oh, my gosh.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.618
They're ripping off Kira's face.

08:38.860 --> 08:40.159
It just seems weird.

08:40.195 --> 08:42.487
Oh, stop worrying.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.732
Some kids don't get facial
hair till they're in college.

08:45.767 --> 08:49.076
I was talking about KC.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.579
I just don't believe
she went to a spa.

08:51.615 --> 08:55.450
Then why is there
a spa charge on my phone app?

08:55.452 --> 08:58.612
Hey, why is there no
spa charge on my phone app?

08:58.647 --> 09:00.855
Wait a second.

09:00.890 --> 09:02.448
What if KC and your mother

09:02.484 --> 09:04.633
didn't really go to that spa,

09:04.669 --> 09:05.902
and they're up to something?

09:05.937 --> 09:08.721
I know.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.674
What if Mom's sister
isn't really dead?

09:11.709 --> 09:13.434
What if Mom knows where she is

09:13.470 --> 09:15.545
and is secretly
taking Abby to meet her?

09:15.580 --> 09:17.439
Ernie, please.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.958
I'm trying to think.

09:19.993 --> 09:23.444
What if, instead of being dead,

09:23.480 --> 09:27.448
Erica's just been hiding
all these years?

09:27.484 --> 09:30.026
I bet your mom and KC
are secretly taking Abby

09:30.062 --> 09:32.520
to meet her.

09:32.556 --> 09:35.673
Wow. Why didn't I think of that?

09:35.709 --> 09:37.458
Erica's dangerous.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.619
I'm gonna go help them. You
should come along, too, Ernie.

09:39.654 --> 09:42.054
Give you a a chance to see
how a top spy operates.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.993
Top spy? Does that mean
someone else is coming with us?

09:53.376 --> 09:56.060
Why are we at a private airport?

09:56.096 --> 09:58.463
Because it's the fastest way
to the Caribbean.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.122
And we don't want you
to wait any longer

10:00.157 --> 10:02.917
than necessary to meet your mother.
So KC's calling in a favor.

10:02.953 --> 10:04.660
I'd feel bad for stealing
this helicopter

10:04.695 --> 10:07.121
if you hadn't have
stolen it first.

10:07.156 --> 10:09.649
KC has a friend
who owns a helicopter?

10:09.651 --> 10:13.119
Yes. She has several friends
who own helicopters.

10:13.155 --> 10:15.655
In fact, KC volunteers
her time with

10:15.690 --> 10:17.315
over-privileged youth.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.644
Yep, my baby's a do-gooder.

10:26.609 --> 10:28.951
Not feeling so smug now,
are you, smuggler?

10:28.986 --> 10:32.364
She never mentioned doing
any volunteer work to me.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.191
Well, she doesn't like to brag.

10:35.226 --> 10:37.593
And that's the first sign
of a good do-gooder.

10:37.629 --> 10:40.337
Doin' good.

10:40.373 --> 10:42.133
All right, guys, come on.

10:45.286 --> 10:46.828
You know how to fly
one of those?!

10:46.863 --> 10:48.554
Uh, I just got
my learner's permit,

10:48.589 --> 10:50.064
and I'm not allowed
to fly in the dark,

10:50.099 --> 10:51.179
so hurry up and get in.

11:01.719 --> 11:03.678
ERNIE: Hey, stop the van.

11:03.713 --> 11:05.433
The GPS signals stop here.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.634
Look. Mom's car.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.462
There's no one inside.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.872
- I can't believe it.
- Is it a clue?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.048
No. Mom's car.

11:16.084 --> 11:18.718
It's filthy.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.286
I go through all that trouble
to write "Wash me"

11:20.321 --> 11:22.663
in the dirt, and she ignores it.

11:22.699 --> 11:24.665
What's that on the ground
next to the car?

11:24.701 --> 11:28.694
A wrapper from your mom's
favorite type of chewing gum.

11:28.729 --> 11:34.192
Someone must've captured her,
and she left that as a clue.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.319
Or... Mom just parked there
because it's next to

11:36.354 --> 11:39.480
that private airport,
and she needed a piece of gum

11:39.515 --> 11:41.282
because her ears
always pop when she flies.

11:41.317 --> 11:44.010
Ernie, please, please!

11:44.045 --> 11:46.320
Would you let the experienced
guy handle this?

11:48.758 --> 11:50.950
Wait a minute.
I have a new theory.

11:55.890 --> 11:59.533
( Screaming ) Ow, ow, that hurts.
You're killing me.

11:59.569 --> 12:02.287
<i>I'm begging you.
Stop it. Please stop.</i>

12:02.322 --> 12:03.922
( screaming ) You're a monster!

12:03.957 --> 12:05.006
<i>A monster.</i>

12:06.801 --> 12:10.503
Sir! The Cooper situation
has taken an ugly turn.

12:10.538 --> 12:12.755
It appears Kira
is being tortured.

12:12.790 --> 12:14.373
We can't wait any longer.

12:14.408 --> 12:15.517
We have to save her.
We're going in.

12:15.552 --> 12:17.685
Let's move it.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.964
Hey.

12:22.000 --> 12:24.567
Do you have any idea where the people
who took your helicopter were going?

12:24.602 --> 12:28.687
They asked if it had enough
fuel to get to Anguilla.

12:28.723 --> 12:31.440
Ernie, stop wasting time
talking to this guy.

12:31.476 --> 12:33.236
We have to figure out
where your mother went.

12:41.661 --> 12:45.171
KC, how exactly do you know
how to fly a helicopter?

12:45.206 --> 12:47.457
Uh...

12:47.492 --> 12:51.369
It was one of those
Cheapon deals.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.921
Um, you see, when
my mom got bored

12:52.956 --> 12:55.030
with the whole accounting thing,

12:55.066 --> 12:58.392
we signed up for
a six-week flying class.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.396
Seriously, you guys. Enough.

13:02.432 --> 13:03.782
I got a scholarship to Howard.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.634
I'm not an idiot. Tell me
what's really going on.

13:06.669 --> 13:09.595
All right. I know I said
we shouldn't tell her,

13:09.630 --> 13:11.873
but she's family,
so we're just gonna

13:11.908 --> 13:13.999
trust her with the truth.
Go ahead, KC.

13:14.035 --> 13:16.694
Okay, fine.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.440
Abby, what's really
going on is...

13:20.475 --> 13:22.842
you were born a princess
in a war-torn foreign...

13:22.878 --> 13:25.586
KC, tell her!

13:25.621 --> 13:27.788
Fine.

13:27.824 --> 13:29.457
This is gonna sound
a little bit crazy, too,

13:29.492 --> 13:32.660
but...

13:32.695 --> 13:34.178
( sighs )
we're a family of spies.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.648
My mom's a spy, my dad's a spy,

13:36.650 --> 13:38.366
- I'm a spy.
- Yeah, right. And Ernie's a spy too?

13:38.401 --> 13:39.901
Yes. Ernie is a spy.

13:39.936 --> 13:43.688
Although that part does sound
a bit unbelievable.

13:45.541 --> 13:47.892
But really, it's all true.

13:47.927 --> 13:49.968
Really?

13:50.004 --> 13:52.187
Really.

13:52.223 --> 13:55.992
<i>Now activating
automatic pilot mode.</i>

14:01.449 --> 14:06.660
Okay. Guess you guys are spies.

14:06.696 --> 14:09.581
Wait. Does that mean
my mother's a spy, too?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.899
No wonder she had to give me up.

14:11.935 --> 14:14.134
That would all make sense.

14:14.170 --> 14:15.244
She was so busy saving the world

14:15.279 --> 14:19.081
from evil that she had no choice
but to fake her own death.

14:19.116 --> 14:20.642
- Right?
- No, not exactly.

14:20.677 --> 14:22.543
Not even close.

14:22.578 --> 14:25.713
She's one of
the bad guys, isn't she?

14:25.748 --> 14:27.628
- Really bad.
- Worst of the worst.

14:29.269 --> 14:30.601
I'm sorry, Abby.

14:30.636 --> 14:32.528
So am I.

14:35.967 --> 14:37.975
I don't even know
if I still wanna meet her.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.010
Is it too late to just
turn around

14:40.046 --> 14:41.687
and actually go to that spa?

14:41.722 --> 14:43.914
Look, I know you're scared,

14:43.949 --> 14:46.467
but we're gonna get
through this together.

14:46.503 --> 14:48.836
As a family.

15:00.683 --> 15:02.625
I don't understand this.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.185
We've looked for
Erica everywhere.

15:04.220 --> 15:05.477
Where is she?

15:05.513 --> 15:07.713
Gee, Mom, I have no idea

15:07.748 --> 15:09.724
why a wanted fugitive
would be so hard to find.

15:09.759 --> 15:11.358
Unless she doesn't
wanna meet me.

15:11.394 --> 15:13.675
No, I've been in touch with her

15:13.705 --> 15:15.596
using coded messages
on the dark net.

15:15.631 --> 15:17.773
She said she'd be near
this cafe at this time.

15:17.808 --> 15:18.991
I don't get it.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.470
- Mom, that's her.
- Where?

15:23.506 --> 15:25.197
That older woman right there.

15:25.233 --> 15:27.558
She's been staring at us
since we walked in.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.151
You think that's my sister?

15:29.186 --> 15:31.303
How old do you think I am?

15:31.338 --> 15:33.547
I'm saying it's a mask.

15:39.931 --> 15:42.406
Aunt Erica.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.600
It's me. KC. Kira's daughter.

15:44.635 --> 15:46.493
Who?

15:46.529 --> 15:49.121
Oh, come on. Stop pretending.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.839
I know it's you under there.

15:50.874 --> 15:52.150
Just take off the mask.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.234
Ow!

15:56.331 --> 15:58.571
Boy, that's really
glued on there good, isn't it?

15:59.492 --> 16:01.826
I believe you're looking for me.

16:04.246 --> 16:05.521
Wait. If you're Erica,

16:05.557 --> 16:07.214
then that means...

16:07.250 --> 16:08.250
Ooh, my bad.

16:10.253 --> 16:12.436
Hello, Abby.

16:12.472 --> 16:15.056
I'd know my baby anywhere.

16:15.091 --> 16:16.957
I can't believe,
after all these years,

16:16.993 --> 16:18.225
I'm looking into
your beautiful eyes again.

16:18.261 --> 16:20.127
Actually...

16:20.162 --> 16:22.238
I'm KC.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.131
That's Abby.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.384
Hello.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.995
Oh. Well, in all fairness,

16:29.030 --> 16:30.354
it has been a while.

16:34.068 --> 16:38.646
Growing up, I felt like
an outsider in my own family.

16:38.681 --> 16:39.914
I know they all
tried their best,

16:39.949 --> 16:42.033
but that didn't make
the loneliness any less painful.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.868
That's so sad.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.611
It is so sad.

16:45.646 --> 16:46.996
And then, when I found out

16:47.031 --> 16:51.166
that my parents picked Kira
to join the Organization

16:51.201 --> 16:53.669
while keeping me
in the dark all that time,

16:53.705 --> 16:55.313
it just pushed me over the edge.

16:55.348 --> 16:56.905
And why wouldn't it?

16:56.941 --> 16:59.566
You were so alone.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.185
For the hundredth time, Erica,

17:01.220 --> 17:03.829
they didn't recruit you
because they were concerned

17:03.864 --> 17:06.624
about your anti-social
tendencies.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.809
So I'm not a people person!

17:11.764 --> 17:15.349
Anyway, as I was saying,

17:15.384 --> 17:18.302
it wasn't long after that

17:18.337 --> 17:19.812
that I joined the Other Side

17:19.847 --> 17:23.757
There, my anti-social tendencies

17:23.793 --> 17:27.594
were not just tolerated,
but celebrated.

17:27.630 --> 17:29.037
I quickly rose up the ranks

17:29.073 --> 17:30.089
and became their top operative.

17:30.124 --> 17:33.175
Then I got the assignment
where I met your father.

17:33.210 --> 17:35.753
He was a brilliant
research scientist,

17:35.788 --> 17:38.597
and my orders were to make him
fall in love with me,

17:38.633 --> 17:40.666
and he did.

17:40.701 --> 17:43.260
But I also
fell in love with him.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.403
For the first time in my life,

17:44.438 --> 17:46.405
I was totally happy.

17:46.440 --> 17:48.057
Till you came along.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.096
Wow. You really aren't
a people person.

17:54.131 --> 17:56.398
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

17:56.434 --> 17:58.225
Becoming a mother changed me.

17:58.261 --> 18:01.887
I wanted out, but you can't
just quit the Other Side.

18:01.923 --> 18:04.765
Oh, you were torn.

18:04.800 --> 18:05.950
You were torn between
two worlds.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.960
You had a baby in your arms
and a gun to your head.

18:07.995 --> 18:11.939
In order to save Abby
from the life I was living,

18:11.974 --> 18:13.941
I was forced
to fake my own death,

18:13.976 --> 18:15.551
go on the run
and give up my family,

18:15.586 --> 18:18.137
even though it broke my heart
into a million pieces.

18:18.139 --> 18:23.092
Giving up your own baby
to give her a better life.

18:23.127 --> 18:25.827
That just...
I'm sorry. I can't take it.

18:25.863 --> 18:28.214
Neither can I, KC.

18:28.249 --> 18:30.049
I really appreciate you caring,

18:30.084 --> 18:32.034
but take it down a notch.

18:32.070 --> 18:34.094
I can't even hear
my own life story.

18:34.129 --> 18:35.563
Go on.

18:35.598 --> 18:37.539
I was on my own,

18:37.575 --> 18:40.225
a fugitive from both sides,

18:40.261 --> 18:41.635
and after a few years
of being on the run,

18:41.670 --> 18:43.962
I realized I needed help.

18:43.998 --> 18:46.082
But I couldn't bring myself
to ask my parents,

18:46.117 --> 18:49.468
and Kira had always
been fair with me.

18:49.504 --> 18:52.797
Finally you get to
the good part of the story.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.608
And now, after all these years,

18:55.643 --> 18:56.441
we're finally
all together again.

18:56.477 --> 18:58.669
Except your father.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.397
Not a day went by that
I didn't think of the two of you

19:01.432 --> 19:03.883
How is he?

19:03.918 --> 19:05.776
I'm sorry, Mom.

19:05.811 --> 19:07.052
He recently passed.

19:09.657 --> 19:12.332
Excuse me, can we get some more
napkins over here please?

19:12.368 --> 19:13.368
Thank you.

19:15.471 --> 19:17.930
I love massages.

19:17.965 --> 19:19.845
I could just tune out the world.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.242
We got her!

19:29.277 --> 19:31.419
No, we don't.

19:31.454 --> 19:33.596
- That isn't Kira Cooper.
- Or is it?

19:33.631 --> 19:35.080
New face.

19:39.495 --> 19:41.879
Good work, Gibb.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.581
Uh, excuse me.

19:43.616 --> 19:45.783
For a deep tissue massage,

19:45.818 --> 19:47.851
this massage
isn't really very deep.

19:47.886 --> 19:48.926
Come on, rubby rubby.

19:58.531 --> 20:00.651
( Falsetto ) Hello.

20:02.876 --> 20:04.618
We've been sitting here
way too long.

20:04.653 --> 20:06.270
I like to keep moving.

20:06.305 --> 20:08.338
That way, nobody
can track me down.

20:08.374 --> 20:11.250
Oh, we've already
tracked you down.

20:11.252 --> 20:13.911
Anguilla's a long way to go
for a massage, Kira.

20:15.648 --> 20:17.139
Anything you wanna share?

20:17.174 --> 20:18.866
Uh, plantain chips.

20:18.901 --> 20:20.741
They're loaded
with antioxidants.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.723
How did you find us?

20:25.758 --> 20:27.324
Please. It was child's play.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.769
Yeah, this child.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.979
So you're the husband
I've heard so much about.

20:32.014 --> 20:35.015
And you're the sister
I've heard nothing good about.

20:37.745 --> 20:39.103
You look familiar.

20:41.031 --> 20:45.459
Oh, I know. You remind me of
a guy I went to college with.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.615
That was a different time
in a different world.

20:51.042 --> 20:54.168
How about we let Abby and Erica
get reacquainted,

20:54.170 --> 20:56.410
and we'll explain everything
to you guys outside.

21:11.445 --> 21:13.312
I still can't believe
I found you.

21:13.347 --> 21:15.815
Took you long enough.

21:15.850 --> 21:20.035
It was so nice of you to take
such an interest in me

21:20.071 --> 21:23.063
all these years... Mother.

21:25.226 --> 21:26.658
What are you really doing here?

21:26.693 --> 21:28.294
Caring out my mission.

21:28.329 --> 21:29.612
Which is?

21:29.647 --> 21:32.147
Win KC's trust

21:32.183 --> 21:35.375
so she'd convince Kira
to bring me to you.

21:35.411 --> 21:37.586
And now what?

21:37.621 --> 21:40.097
You intend to terminate
your own mother?

21:40.133 --> 21:41.957
You don't wanna
mess with me, baby girl,

21:41.993 --> 21:44.593
'cause I am one bad mama.

21:44.629 --> 21:46.945
Bad?

21:46.980 --> 21:49.932
I'd say you're the worst.

21:49.967 --> 21:52.017
But you're a good spy,

21:52.052 --> 21:54.203
and the Other Side
wants you reactivated.

21:54.238 --> 21:56.263
Dad says he needs you
for one final mission.

21:56.298 --> 21:58.415
So he is alive.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.351
He's expecting you.

22:01.387 --> 22:05.539
We did good, Mom. You did good.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.449
Well, now...

22:07.484 --> 22:10.569
looks like Mama's back.

22:15.234 --> 22:17.959
<i>Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
