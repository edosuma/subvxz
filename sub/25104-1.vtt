00:03.579 --> 00:06.548
This season on "MasterChef,"
everything has changed.

00:09.551 --> 00:12.688
Because this season,
the judges do battle.

00:12.722 --> 00:17.192
Every home cook we bring here
to the MasterChef kitchen...

00:17.226 --> 00:20.562
Is competing
for a MasterChef white apron.

00:23.098 --> 00:25.935
Each of us have
just eight aprons.

00:25.968 --> 00:29.672
Just eight chances to find
America's next MasterChef.

00:31.841 --> 00:34.543
And if a judge chooses
a home cook to wear
one of our aprons...

00:34.576 --> 00:37.813
We become their mentor.

00:37.847 --> 00:41.450
- ( cheering )
- There are thousands
of hopeful home cooks.

00:41.483 --> 00:44.720
( Crowd chanting )
MasterChef!

00:44.754 --> 00:46.121
Gordon:
Those that make the cut...

00:46.155 --> 00:48.090
- Wow!
- Oh, my goodness!

00:48.123 --> 00:49.424
...will soar...

00:49.458 --> 00:51.226
- Whoo!
- You guys look great!

00:51.260 --> 00:52.795
...to new heights...

00:52.828 --> 00:55.330
Are those people?
Oh, my God!

00:55.364 --> 00:57.232
Woman:
They're landing for dinner!

00:57.266 --> 00:59.468
- ( horn honking )
- ...they'll feel the heat...

00:59.501 --> 01:00.903
Whoa! It's burning.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.438
...as they cook
for American heroes...

01:03.472 --> 01:06.075
- Aarón: Don't let these
firefighters down.
- Let's go, guys!

01:06.108 --> 01:08.243
...run five-star
restaurants...

01:08.277 --> 01:10.579
- Where's the beef?
- I need some entrées now.

01:10.612 --> 01:13.615
...and cater all-star events.

01:13.649 --> 01:17.152
I'm honored to declare you
husband and wife.

01:17.186 --> 01:18.688
Along the way,

01:18.721 --> 01:22.858
we as mentors will face
tough decisions.

01:22.892 --> 01:24.459
What happened?

01:24.493 --> 01:26.361
The home cook
that I would send home

01:26.395 --> 01:28.764
is wearing an apron
that I gave them.

01:28.798 --> 01:32.167
But we'll experience some of
the most spectacular dishes...

01:32.201 --> 01:33.969
This is a home run.

01:34.003 --> 01:36.271
...the MasterChef kitchen
has ever seen.

01:36.305 --> 01:38.473
This is the reason
I gave you an apron.

01:38.507 --> 01:41.176
Gordon:
I was 100% correct
handing you that apron.

01:41.210 --> 01:42.678
You've been
a perfect student,

01:42.712 --> 01:44.279
potentially America's
next MasterChef.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.849
Three judges.

01:46.882 --> 01:48.818
Eight precious aprons.

01:50.219 --> 01:52.354
Just one MasterChef.

01:54.423 --> 01:56.926
Let the battle begin.

02:01.864 --> 02:04.867
( music playing )

02:14.877 --> 02:16.478
( cheering and applause )

02:16.511 --> 02:19.048
My name is Gerron,
and I'm an English teacher.

02:19.081 --> 02:20.850
My food is gonna
be the best food

02:20.883 --> 02:22.885
that Gordon Ramsay ever tasted.
So I expect

02:22.918 --> 02:24.153
nothing lower than an A plus.

02:24.186 --> 02:26.155
- Whoo!
- I am Olusola.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.823
I'm from Columbia,
South Carolina.

02:27.857 --> 02:29.825
I've been a bus driver
since I was 18 years old,

02:29.859 --> 02:32.361
but cooking food makes me feel
like I'm alive.

02:32.394 --> 02:33.562
I've daydreamed about cooking

02:33.595 --> 02:35.030
since I was six years old,

02:35.064 --> 02:36.431
but I've never
had an opportunity

02:36.465 --> 02:37.900
to follow my dream.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.034
I have to shine.

02:39.068 --> 02:40.936
Wow!
My name is Farhan.

02:40.970 --> 02:43.438
I live in Chicago, Illinois,
and I'm a dental student.

02:43.472 --> 02:45.274
I know mouths better
than anyone else.

02:45.307 --> 02:47.676
I know how to clean them
and I know how to feed them.

02:47.709 --> 02:49.178
So, I wanna be the person

02:49.211 --> 02:51.013
that shows America
what Indian food is about.

02:51.046 --> 02:53.883
( cheering and applause )

02:53.916 --> 02:55.250
Hello!

02:58.153 --> 02:59.889
Welcome to "MasterChef"!

02:59.922 --> 03:01.957
- I'm Gordon Ramsay.
- I'm Aarón Sánchez.

03:01.991 --> 03:03.458
And I'm Joe Bastianich.

03:03.492 --> 03:07.196
And trust me, we searched
all across America

03:07.229 --> 03:08.931
for talented home cooks,

03:08.964 --> 03:11.466
and we found them:

03:11.500 --> 03:12.968
You.

03:13.002 --> 03:14.436
Make no mistake.

03:14.469 --> 03:16.305
Winning "MasterChef"
will unlock

03:16.338 --> 03:19.208
every culinary door
you've ever dreamed of.

03:19.241 --> 03:22.577
And the winner will go home

03:22.611 --> 03:23.979
with a quarter of
a million dollars.

03:24.013 --> 03:26.048
( cheering and applause )

03:26.081 --> 03:28.417
Home cooks, it's a long road

03:28.450 --> 03:31.887
to become America's
next MasterChef.

03:31.921 --> 03:36.725
And you don't even take one
tiny step on that journey

03:36.758 --> 03:39.494
unless you win one of these.

03:40.796 --> 03:44.166
( cheering and applause )

03:44.199 --> 03:48.603
The incredible MasterChef
white apron.

03:48.637 --> 03:52.174
But how you win one of these
is much different

03:52.207 --> 03:53.909
than ever before.

03:53.943 --> 03:57.412
Each judge will have just
eight aprons to give out.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.648
But that doesn't make it easier.

03:59.681 --> 04:02.017
In fact,
it's a whole lot harder,

04:02.051 --> 04:05.654
because we are
battling it out

04:05.687 --> 04:09.424
to identify
the next MasterChef.

04:09.458 --> 04:12.461
That means our reputations
are on the line.

04:12.494 --> 04:15.364
If more than of us
offers you an apron,

04:15.397 --> 04:18.533
you will be in the unique
position of getting to choose

04:18.567 --> 04:20.302
whose apron you take.

04:20.335 --> 04:23.305
And this year, the judge
that gives you that apron

04:23.338 --> 04:25.540
will then be your mentor
throughout the competition.

04:25.574 --> 04:28.777
One last thing: we've invited
your friends and family here

04:28.810 --> 04:31.013
to support you
and encourage you.

04:31.046 --> 04:32.647
Good luck to you all.

04:32.681 --> 04:35.684
( cheering and applause )

04:42.224 --> 04:44.559
Narrator:
In the auditions
for a white apron,

04:44.593 --> 04:46.528
the home cooks will fight
to impress the judges

04:46.561 --> 04:48.697
with their signature dishes.

04:48.730 --> 04:50.966
The judges will then decide

04:51.000 --> 04:53.302
who wins a MasterChef
white apron

04:53.335 --> 04:55.704
and a place in the top 24.

04:57.606 --> 04:59.074
My whole life, basically,
has been building up to this.

04:59.108 --> 05:01.076
Everything has revolved
around food.

05:01.110 --> 05:03.879
I'm Emily. I'm 28,
and I'm from Neenah, Wisconsin.

05:03.913 --> 05:06.215
I live and breathe food.

05:06.248 --> 05:09.051
Growing up,
my mom had a travel bug.

05:09.084 --> 05:11.053
I've been to almost
every continent.

05:11.086 --> 05:12.888
I can't get chicken liver
mousse in Wisconsin,

05:12.922 --> 05:14.156
and so I said,
"You know what?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.390
I'll make it myself."

05:15.424 --> 05:17.059
Competing on "MasterChef,"

05:17.092 --> 05:18.693
this is literally my dream.

05:18.727 --> 05:19.929
I wanna prove

05:19.962 --> 05:22.932
that I am as good
as I think I am.

05:22.965 --> 05:24.366
You're gonna put Cambodian food
on the map.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.535
Yes!
My name is Jannie. I'm 29.

05:26.568 --> 05:29.538
I'm from Las Vegas, Nevada,
and I'm a cocktail server.

05:29.571 --> 05:31.240
Vegas nightlife is
its own world.

05:31.273 --> 05:34.376
I get to make sure
people have an amazing time.

05:34.409 --> 05:36.211
I love my job,
but wherever I am in life,

05:36.245 --> 05:37.779
something always brings me
back to food.

05:37.812 --> 05:39.281
I use a lot of lemongrass,

05:39.314 --> 05:40.849
so, gotta keep that stocked.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.751
I'm Cambodian and Vietnamese,

05:42.784 --> 05:45.054
so a lot of lemongrass, kaffir
lime leaves, a lot of turmeric.

05:45.087 --> 05:46.888
As a Vegas vixen,

05:46.922 --> 05:49.191
I'm gonna make sure my food
looks as good as it tastes.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.594
I'm excited to go in that door
to get my apron.

05:52.627 --> 05:54.296
My apron will be for you.

05:54.329 --> 05:57.666
( speaking Mandarin )

06:00.102 --> 06:02.271
My name's Bowen.
I'm 24 years old.

06:02.304 --> 06:04.306
I'm a pilot
from Tianjin, China.

06:04.339 --> 06:07.977
When I was 15 years old,
I came to the United States.

06:08.010 --> 06:10.980
In China, my dad is
a professional chef.

06:11.013 --> 06:14.950
By watching my dad's cooking,
I fell in love with food.

06:14.984 --> 06:18.753
Back two years ago, I got
in a severe car accident.

06:18.787 --> 06:22.057
I was in the hospital
for almost a year.

06:22.091 --> 06:24.393
There in the hospital,

06:24.426 --> 06:26.962
the only TV program
I would watch is "MasterChef."

06:26.996 --> 06:29.131
"MasterChef" got me through it.

06:29.164 --> 06:33.268
The doctor said it's a miracle.

06:33.302 --> 06:35.304
( cheering and applause )

06:37.772 --> 06:39.641
Emily:
Even though each judge

06:39.674 --> 06:41.110
only has eight aprons
to give out--

06:41.143 --> 06:43.979
I mean, that's only 24
aprons total.

06:44.013 --> 06:45.814
- ( gasps )
- Welcome!

06:45.847 --> 06:47.349
Emily:
I'm going in there
with the mindset

06:47.382 --> 06:48.817
that I will get an apron
offered to me

06:48.850 --> 06:50.986
- by all three judges.
- Let's go!

06:51.020 --> 06:54.656
I am for sure going
to get an apron.

06:54.689 --> 06:56.758
All three of you,
good evening and welcome

06:56.791 --> 06:58.994
to the most amazing kitchen
anywhere in America.

06:59.028 --> 07:03.265
Tonight, each one of your
signature dishes features beef.

07:03.298 --> 07:07.102
You have just 30 minutes
on the clock.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.271
- Are you all ready to cook?
- All: Yes, Chef!

07:09.304 --> 07:12.107
Your 30 minutes starts...

07:12.141 --> 07:13.108
now!

07:13.142 --> 07:15.144
( music playing )

07:19.081 --> 07:21.283
All right, guys, so we have
eight aprons to give away.

07:21.316 --> 07:22.951
What I'm looking for
is discipline.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.020
Can they absorb
like a sponge?

07:25.054 --> 07:27.689
That hunger to learn more.

07:27.722 --> 07:31.226
And how much better can I make
them across this journey?

07:31.260 --> 07:32.894
I'm thinking about how grandiose
are their ideas.

07:32.927 --> 07:34.729
Are they big thinkers?
Are they creative

07:34.763 --> 07:36.665
and open to new ideas?

07:36.698 --> 07:39.401
My eight aprons, I'm looking for
someone who shows confidence,

07:39.434 --> 07:41.070
but you've gotta be willing
to take direction

07:41.103 --> 07:43.138
admit to what you don't know
and be willing to learn.

07:43.172 --> 07:44.906
So when I look,
I gotta see someone

07:44.939 --> 07:47.642
who can win this competition.

07:47.676 --> 07:49.344
Jannie, give us an insight
to the dish tonight.

07:49.378 --> 07:51.246
I'm making my Cambodian
beef skewers

07:51.280 --> 07:53.648
with green papaya pickle
and a coconut rice.

07:53.682 --> 07:54.849
It is
from my heritage

07:54.883 --> 07:56.418
- and my culture.
- Cambodia.

07:56.451 --> 07:58.587
Some of the best food
I've ever eaten.

08:00.922 --> 08:03.158
Miss Emily, talk to me
a little bit about
what you're making.

08:03.192 --> 08:06.595
I will be making a filet mignon
over fondant potato,

08:06.628 --> 08:08.930
mushroom duxelle
with a red wine pan sauce.

08:08.963 --> 08:11.766
This dish is entrenched
in a lot of French technique,

08:11.800 --> 08:13.702
- it sounds like.
- Yes.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.370
I've had the opportunity
to travel the world.

08:15.404 --> 08:16.771
I've been to France
a few times,

08:16.805 --> 08:18.740
and being
a food anthropologist,

08:18.773 --> 08:21.676
I've definitely honed my skills
having that global experience.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.179
Emily, I just assumed
you're a food anthropologist,

08:24.213 --> 08:26.515
that garlic powder
and onion powder

08:26.548 --> 08:28.117
is something more for
traditional home cooks.

08:28.150 --> 08:29.518
I feel like that's a little
pedestrian way

08:29.551 --> 08:31.720
to look at it.
Do you never use

08:31.753 --> 08:33.622
onion powder and garlic powder
in the kitchen?

08:33.655 --> 08:35.257
No. Never.

08:35.290 --> 08:38.627
Gordon:
20 minutes remaining.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.095
Bowen, give us an insight
into what you're making.

08:40.129 --> 08:42.797
I'm making
a lion's head meatball,

08:42.831 --> 08:45.134
a soft-boiled egg stuffed
inside a meatball.

08:45.167 --> 08:46.801
- So it's a Scotch egg.
- Yes.

08:46.835 --> 08:48.637
So, Bowen,
who'd you learn
to cook from?

08:48.670 --> 08:50.071
I learned from my father.

08:50.105 --> 08:51.940
My father is just
like a Chinese version

08:51.973 --> 08:53.275
of Gordon Ramsay.

08:53.308 --> 08:54.743
He's always yelling
at the kitchen.

08:56.678 --> 08:59.748
- Is Gordon big in China?
- He's famous everywhere.

08:59.781 --> 09:01.316
How about me?
Am I famous in China?

09:01.350 --> 09:03.618
- Of course, famous.
- Yeah? As famous as Gordon?

09:03.652 --> 09:06.288
Oh, you're trying
to give me trouble, huh?

09:08.757 --> 09:10.992
Aarón:
Guys, we are down
to seven minutes left.

09:11.025 --> 09:12.294
Emily:
They look good, Bowen.

09:12.327 --> 09:13.662
Of course. Always.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.666
Aarón:
Jannie, you just chose
to put the beef on.

09:17.699 --> 09:19.234
Is that 'cause you wanted the
beef to marinate sufficiently?

09:19.268 --> 09:21.136
Yes. It's gonna
be bold flavored.

09:21.170 --> 09:22.604
Very bold.

09:22.637 --> 09:24.806
- I know you guys will enjoy it.
- All right, guys,

09:24.839 --> 09:26.808
so we couldn't have three
more different beef dishes.

09:26.841 --> 09:30.412
For me, Jannie,
I think, has the biggest
level of difficulty.

09:30.445 --> 09:32.281
Is she gonna get enough
of those aromatic flavors

09:32.314 --> 09:34.115
in a very tight
window of time?

09:34.149 --> 09:36.651
- Almost two minutes, guys.
- Emily's issue tonight,

09:36.685 --> 09:38.353
- the temperature on that filet.
- But, come on, garlic powder

09:38.387 --> 09:40.289
- and onion powder.
- By the way,

09:40.322 --> 09:42.491
the secret there is making sure
it's got an even color.

09:42.524 --> 09:43.925
Joe:
And is it too simple?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.794
Gordon:
60 seconds remaining.

09:45.827 --> 09:47.796
This is where it counts.
Come on.

09:47.829 --> 09:49.531
Bowen's got his meatball out.
He's slicing it now.

09:49.564 --> 09:51.600
Wow! Emily,
is that filet gonna
be medium rare?

09:51.633 --> 09:53.202
- Yes, sir.
- Gordon: Ten...

09:53.235 --> 09:55.970
Chefs:
Nine, eight, seven...

09:56.004 --> 10:00.342
- Bowen: Come on, let's go!
- six, five, four, three,

10:00.375 --> 10:02.544
- two, one.
- Gordon: And stop.

10:02.577 --> 10:04.846
- Hands in the air. Well done.
- Joe: Wow!

10:04.879 --> 10:07.382
All three of you,
bring your dishes down
to the front, please.

10:07.416 --> 10:09.218
Thank you.

10:13.922 --> 10:16.825
Aarón: So, three very
passionate home cooks,

10:16.858 --> 10:19.694
all with signature dishes
that featured beef.

10:19.728 --> 10:21.463
Let's taste.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.232
Jannie,
describe the dish.

10:23.265 --> 10:26.301
It's Cambodian beef skewers

10:26.335 --> 10:27.736
with a green papaya pickle
and coconut rice.

10:27.769 --> 10:29.204
What are some
of the flavors

10:29.238 --> 10:31.072
I'm supposed to
be experiencing here?

10:31.105 --> 10:33.275
- You'll get the lemongrass
for sure.
- Mmm.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.480
The beef is tender,
the marinade came through.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.849
And I gotta say,
I like the pickle.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.551
- Well done.
- Thank you.

10:48.857 --> 10:51.660
- Very sweet.
- I like my beef a little bit
on the sweeter side

10:51.693 --> 10:53.295
'cause I put honey in it.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.398
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

10:56.431 --> 10:58.099
And inside the rice?

10:58.132 --> 11:00.269
There's coconut milk and ginger
and a little bit of salt.

11:00.302 --> 11:01.903
Tastes quite nice.

11:01.936 --> 11:03.938
This is traditionally
a street food dish.

11:03.972 --> 11:06.441
It needs heat.
Bit of chili.

11:06.475 --> 11:08.209
So you've got something
that's that sweet,

11:08.243 --> 11:10.279
then you need
to balance it out
with that heat.

11:10.312 --> 11:12.146
Thank you.

11:14.148 --> 11:15.384
Emily, name of the dish?

11:15.417 --> 11:17.386
This is a filet mignon

11:17.419 --> 11:19.288
over fondant potato,
mushroom duxelle,

11:19.321 --> 11:21.222
and a red wine pan sauce.

11:23.091 --> 11:25.126
Let's see.
Medium rare.

11:25.159 --> 11:27.396
- And what did you season with?
- Onion and garlic powder.

11:27.429 --> 11:30.265
- My apologies.
- You don't have to apologize.

11:30.299 --> 11:32.501
There's just a right way
of doing things.

11:37.339 --> 11:38.973
Great color
on the steak.

11:39.007 --> 11:40.942
- How long did you cook it for?
- Two minutes each side,

11:40.975 --> 11:42.644
and then I finished in the oven
for about eight minutes.

11:42.677 --> 11:44.646
Wow!
The beef is delicious.

11:44.679 --> 11:49.551
But a duxelle would generally
be for lining or wrapping.

11:49.584 --> 11:52.153
When you have a filet mignon
like that you find
the best mushroom

11:52.186 --> 11:53.588
so it highlights the beef.

11:53.622 --> 11:55.557
However,
it's perfectly executed.

11:55.590 --> 11:57.392
Thank you.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.628
- Why duxelle?
- Mushrooms are earthy flavor.

11:59.661 --> 12:03.131
I think it's a nice component
to the beef on the plate.

12:03.164 --> 12:04.733
It's buttery and rich.
I like the duxelle.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.302
That's my favorite
part of this dish.

12:07.336 --> 12:09.471
But you need to bring in, for
me, a little bit more acidity.

12:09.504 --> 12:11.105
- Mm-hmm.
- But perfectly cooked.

12:12.841 --> 12:14.609
Bowen,
describe the dish, please.

12:14.643 --> 12:18.012
This dish is called
lion's head meatball,

12:18.046 --> 12:21.683
stuffed with hard-boiled egg,
served with radish pickle.

12:21.716 --> 12:24.453
And what's inside
the ground beef?

12:24.486 --> 12:26.655
Scallions,
water chestnut,

12:26.688 --> 12:29.424
ground ginger,
ground garlic.

12:29.458 --> 12:32.827
It looks weird, but it actually
tastes delicious.

12:32.861 --> 12:34.963
The ground beef is
seasoned beautifully,

12:34.996 --> 12:37.799
and I've got that nice
richness from the egg.

12:37.832 --> 12:39.668
- Good job.
- Thank you.

12:39.701 --> 12:42.170
Bowen, have you made
this dish before?

12:42.203 --> 12:44.339
Yes.

12:44.373 --> 12:47.208
What I'm tasting is a beautiful
texture of the beef.

12:47.241 --> 12:49.277
If I wanted to change
one thing,

12:49.310 --> 12:51.846
you don't need all that radish.
It's not serving a purpose.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.047
Thank you.

12:56.017 --> 12:58.152
It's very,
very flavorful.

12:58.186 --> 12:59.721
It's super moist, tender.

12:59.754 --> 13:01.456
You ever think about leaving
a little broth in it?

13:01.490 --> 13:04.025
If I put broth in there
it will be a mess on the plate.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.333
Great job, all of you.
Here's the deal.

13:12.367 --> 13:15.870
You only have to impress one
of us to win an apron.

13:15.904 --> 13:18.139
We only have eight
aprons each.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.843
These are as precious to me
as they are to all
of you home cooks.

13:21.876 --> 13:23.578
I'm going against
my colleagues here.

13:23.612 --> 13:26.881
I wanna be the one that puts
forward the next MasterChef.

13:26.915 --> 13:29.484
You might have multiple offers
from all three of us.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.186
If that happens,
it's down to you guys

13:32.220 --> 13:34.489
to choose who you want
to be your mentor

13:34.523 --> 13:36.758
throughout this
whole competition.

13:36.791 --> 13:39.728
I saw a lot
of bright spots,

13:39.761 --> 13:42.997
but my standards are super high
and I've not seen enough.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.600
That's three nos for me.

13:45.634 --> 13:48.603
All right,
I think there's one home cook

13:48.637 --> 13:51.706
that has the potential
to be the next MasterChef.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.548
This apron is going to...

14:10.992 --> 14:13.495
This apron is going to...

14:15.997 --> 14:17.799
Bowen.

14:20.301 --> 14:22.437
But I'm not finished yet.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.809
Sometimes what it means

14:27.842 --> 14:29.744
to have the potential
to be the next MasterChef

14:29.778 --> 14:31.245
is not always
in the plate.

14:33.648 --> 14:35.249
Emily, you and I
haven't exactly bonded.

14:35.283 --> 14:37.886
- You're tough.
- Are you worth this apron?

14:37.919 --> 14:40.655
Absolutely.
I'm a sponge.

14:40.689 --> 14:43.191
I'm gonna soak up
every ounce of wisdom
that you bestow upon me.

14:46.260 --> 14:50.799
What you just said
is the very reason why...

14:54.135 --> 14:56.971
I'm gonna give you
this apron.

14:57.005 --> 14:58.873
- Don't let me down.
- Wow!

15:01.876 --> 15:04.646
Gordon, I guess
it's up to you now.

15:04.679 --> 15:08.282
I do have one apron
to give out.

15:13.354 --> 15:14.589
Bowen.

15:14.623 --> 15:16.591
Aarón:
( whispering ) Whoa!

15:16.625 --> 15:19.427
Mm-mm.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.363
So, Jannie, this means that
you'll be leaving the kitchen

15:22.396 --> 15:24.465
without an apron.

15:24.499 --> 15:27.936
Bowen, you have an apron
from Joe Bastianich.

15:27.969 --> 15:30.605
Restaurateur,
probably the best in the world.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.875
And you have an apron from one
of the best chefs in the world.

15:33.908 --> 15:35.810
Who is gonna be your mentor?

15:39.380 --> 15:42.717
His father is a mini me.

15:42.751 --> 15:46.788
And now you have the real
opportunity to be with me,

15:46.821 --> 15:48.489
so there's no choice.

15:48.523 --> 15:50.124
Joe.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.193
This is the single greatest day
of your life,

15:52.226 --> 15:55.229
because I am the greatest mentor
in the history

15:55.263 --> 15:59.534
of the biggest cooking
competition in the world.

15:59.568 --> 16:03.772
Bowen, who is gonna take you to
the top of the culinary world?

16:14.082 --> 16:16.250
Gordon Ramsay.

16:19.287 --> 16:21.055
- Thank you, Jannie.
- Aarón: Thank you, guys.
Well done.

16:21.089 --> 16:23.024
Gordon:
Bowen's a fascinating
character.

16:23.057 --> 16:25.193
My God!
That guy knows how to cook.

16:25.226 --> 16:27.528
- Aarón: The sky's the limit.
- Emily, she's confident.

16:27.562 --> 16:29.197
I didn't love the plate,
but I like the girl.

16:29.230 --> 16:31.232
I think she could
really go far.

16:31.265 --> 16:34.268
( cheering and applause )

16:36.938 --> 16:40.208
I got an apron
from Gordon!

16:40.241 --> 16:42.076
( crying )

16:42.110 --> 16:45.246
( cheering )

16:45.279 --> 16:47.248
Woman:
Jannie, it's okay.

16:47.281 --> 16:50.719
- So proud of you, baby.
- Joe picking me, it's insane!

16:50.752 --> 16:52.587
I really didn't expect it
to come from him,

16:52.621 --> 16:54.388
but that means a lot more

16:54.422 --> 16:55.790
that it's coming from someone
that's so critical.

16:55.824 --> 16:57.425
I'm so happy for you!

16:57.458 --> 16:58.693
I am not gonna let him down.

16:58.727 --> 17:00.394
- Good chef.
- Gordon Ramsay!

17:00.428 --> 17:02.430
My husband, my father, and me,

17:02.463 --> 17:04.065
we all love Gordon Ramsay,

17:04.098 --> 17:06.200
so I will never let
Gordon Ramsay down.

17:06.234 --> 17:08.903
I will become the next
MasterChef!

17:08.937 --> 17:11.139
I'm so proud of you!

17:11.172 --> 17:12.741
( crying )

17:14.609 --> 17:16.244
Narrator:
Up next is Cynthia,

17:16.277 --> 17:19.413
an accounting assistant
from Sylmar, California.

17:19.447 --> 17:20.949
Mom, you're
my favorite cook.

17:20.982 --> 17:22.651
- I'm your favorite cook?
- My favorite.

17:22.684 --> 17:23.952
Mom.

17:23.985 --> 17:25.720
I'm a mother of six.

17:25.754 --> 17:27.722
So, by the time I'm done
doing the dishes,

17:27.756 --> 17:29.123
it's time for the next meal.

17:29.157 --> 17:30.925
Muah!

17:30.959 --> 17:32.794
To cook on "MasterChef,"

17:32.827 --> 17:34.262
it's something
I've always wanted.

17:34.295 --> 17:35.797
And getting this apron,

17:35.830 --> 17:37.565
it will just prove
to my children

17:37.598 --> 17:40.601
that it's never too late
to go after your dreams.

17:40.635 --> 17:41.803
What is Gordon gonna think?

17:41.836 --> 17:43.604
My name is Shanika.

17:43.638 --> 17:45.807
I'm 34 years old.
I'm from Miami, Florida

17:45.840 --> 17:47.541
and I'm an event promoter.

17:48.677 --> 17:50.278
I cook how I look:

17:50.311 --> 17:52.146
bold, tough, daring.

17:52.180 --> 17:54.949
I'm very, very confident
in who I am.

17:54.983 --> 17:57.451
And, you know, when you feel
good and you look good
you cook good.

17:57.485 --> 17:59.253
- The flavors have
to be on point.
- Yeah, man, you got it.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.822
- You got it.
- I know I got it.

18:00.855 --> 18:03.024
I mean, I know my mom
would be proud right now.

18:03.057 --> 18:06.260
I was 14 years old
when I lost my mom,

18:06.294 --> 18:08.429
and my love for cooking
came from my mom.

18:08.462 --> 18:10.464
Losing my mom
at an early age,

18:10.498 --> 18:13.167
it pushed me
to become like an adult.

18:13.201 --> 18:15.770
I actually had to become
the mother for my sister.

18:15.804 --> 18:18.639
It was really, really rough.

18:18.673 --> 18:20.274
But I wouldn't change it.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.976
because I wouldn't
be who I am today.

18:22.010 --> 18:23.644
I wouldn't be
as strong as I am.

18:23.678 --> 18:25.546
( cheering and applause )

18:25.579 --> 18:27.849
And I'm ready
to show these judges

18:27.882 --> 18:30.318
that I know how to cook.

18:30.351 --> 18:33.888
They're gonna get straight up,
raw Shanika.

18:33.922 --> 18:35.123
Welcome. Come on down.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.825
Very excited to be here.

18:36.858 --> 18:39.160
That is why I'm gonna get
that damn apron.

18:40.428 --> 18:42.864
Welcome to the MasterChef
kitchen.

18:42.897 --> 18:45.834
We started the competition
with only eight aprons each.

18:45.867 --> 18:49.670
Your dishes have to convince
at least one of the three of us

18:49.704 --> 18:52.140
that you are worthy

18:52.173 --> 18:54.809
of one
of our eight aprons.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.479
Ladies, tonight,
you've got 45 minutes

18:58.512 --> 19:01.215
to cook us
your signature dishes.

19:01.249 --> 19:03.217
- Ready?
- Yes, Chef.

19:03.251 --> 19:05.920
Your 45 minutes starts...

19:07.722 --> 19:08.723
now!

19:15.063 --> 19:16.765
- So, Cynthia.
- Yes.

19:16.798 --> 19:18.266
Talk to me a little bit
about your dish.

19:18.299 --> 19:20.568
I'm making a cream biscuit
strawberry shortcake,

19:20.601 --> 19:24.038
a strawberry-mint puree
for the base,

19:24.072 --> 19:26.875
and then I will be doing
a lemon whip

19:26.908 --> 19:29.243
to kinda cut
into the sweetness
a little bit.

19:29.277 --> 19:30.879
Outstanding.

19:30.912 --> 19:32.713
- Shanika, what's the dish?
- Yes, sir.

19:32.747 --> 19:34.415
I'm making a bitter
French kiss.

19:34.448 --> 19:37.685
It is a puff pastry with very,
very sweet dates, goat cheese,

19:37.718 --> 19:39.687
heavy whipping cream to tone it
down just a little bit.

19:39.720 --> 19:43.024
- And it creates just
this marvelous filling.
- Wow!

19:43.057 --> 19:45.860
That ponytail, young lady.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.128
How long is that thing?

19:47.161 --> 19:48.763
This is my Beyoncé ponytail.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.735
Gordon:
Ladies, just under
25 minutes to go.

19:54.769 --> 19:57.105
You make it into
the MasterChef kitchen,

19:57.138 --> 19:59.808
it's your signature dish,
and you decide to bake?

19:59.841 --> 20:01.309
I mean, are they crazy?

20:01.342 --> 20:03.211
Ask any professional
pastry chef.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.479
They wouldn't touch baking
in 45 minutes.

20:05.513 --> 20:07.882
Aarón:
I love the grit of coming on
strong with the dessert.

20:07.916 --> 20:09.450
You're setting the tone.

20:12.020 --> 20:14.122
Cynthia, are you gonna get
a white apron?

20:14.155 --> 20:17.258
It should be good enough
to impress at least one of you.

20:17.291 --> 20:18.793
Gordon:
Right.

20:18.827 --> 20:22.063
Ladies, we're down
to 10 minutes remaining.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.932
Cynthia's biscuits
are still in the oven.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.433
So they're gonna take at least
five, six minutes to cool down.

20:25.466 --> 20:27.168
They've gotta cool down first.

20:27.201 --> 20:28.636
But my worry right now is

20:28.669 --> 20:30.338
that cream is gonna
absolutely disintegrate

20:30.371 --> 20:31.772
the minute it hits
that shortcake.

20:31.806 --> 20:33.607
Oh, my gosh.

20:33.641 --> 20:35.543
Just under eight minutes
remaining, ladies. Come on.

20:36.610 --> 20:38.779
Got a small problem.

20:38.813 --> 20:41.282
Are these cooked desserts
gonna get done?

20:41.315 --> 20:44.485
Let's go, guys!
Come on, pull it together.

20:44.518 --> 20:46.821
Are we gonna be tasting
something or we gonna
be tasting raw pastry?

20:56.697 --> 20:58.266
Gosh.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.202
Just under eight minutes
remaining, ladies. Come on.

21:01.235 --> 21:03.504
Got a small problem.

21:03.537 --> 21:06.007
Are these cooked desserts
gonna get done?

21:06.040 --> 21:09.210
Let's go, guys!
Come on, pull it together.

21:09.243 --> 21:11.545
Are we gonna be tasting
something or we gonna
be tasting raw pastry?

21:15.183 --> 21:16.484
Oh, pastry out.

21:18.019 --> 21:19.820
Wow! That looks perfect.

21:21.555 --> 21:24.825
Shanika, who would you
most want an apron from,

21:24.859 --> 21:26.560
if you had to pick one
of the three?

21:26.594 --> 21:29.330
I really wanna prove to Gordon
that I have what it takes.

21:29.363 --> 21:32.566
I wanna be him.
Period. 100%.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.202
You wanna be the female
version of me?

21:34.235 --> 21:35.703
- Of you.
- Wow!

21:35.736 --> 21:36.971
- Okay.
- Yes, you.

21:37.005 --> 21:38.873
I want you
to give me my apron.

21:41.409 --> 21:42.710
Ladies, five minutes to go.

21:42.743 --> 21:44.545
Here we are.

21:44.578 --> 21:47.848
Joe:
Winning over one of us
is all it takes

21:47.882 --> 21:50.418
to give you an apron
and a place

21:50.451 --> 21:52.053
in America's largest
cooking competition,

21:52.086 --> 21:53.487
the MasterChef kitchen.

21:53.521 --> 21:56.157
This is the one.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.858
Awesome. Yes!

21:57.892 --> 22:02.763
Ladies, we are down
to 60 seconds remaining.

22:02.796 --> 22:06.734
- Showtime.
- I just hope that those
biscuits are cool enough.

22:06.767 --> 22:09.270
Gordon:
Ten, nine...

22:09.303 --> 22:11.605
Chefs:
Eight, seven, six,

22:11.639 --> 22:16.945
five, four, three, two, one.

22:16.978 --> 22:19.213
- Hands in the air. Well done.
- Hands in the air,
hands in the air.

22:19.247 --> 22:20.949
- Nice job, ladies.
- Ladies, very carefully,

22:20.982 --> 22:23.484
please, bring your desserts
down to the front.

22:33.561 --> 22:35.563
Cynthia, describe
the dish, please.

22:35.596 --> 22:38.732
I have a cream biscuit
strawberry shortcake

22:38.766 --> 22:41.902
with a lemon-mint
strawberry puree.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.641
The actual shortcake,
delicious.

22:47.675 --> 22:49.810
It's light, it's fluffy.

22:49.843 --> 22:51.712
Layers are done nicely.

22:51.745 --> 22:53.714
It doesn't give me the wow
factor, in terms of visual.

22:53.747 --> 22:56.050
You could've done
with a glaze on top,

22:56.084 --> 22:57.885
just get a bit of color
contrast.

22:57.918 --> 23:00.754
- But it does taste good.
- Thank you, Chef.

23:03.291 --> 23:05.893
The mint, the strawberry,
the lemon, they all make sense.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.295
There just needs
to be a lot more of it,

23:07.328 --> 23:09.497
but there's enough
great attributes,

23:09.530 --> 23:10.931
that make you remember
this dessert.

23:10.965 --> 23:12.266
Thank you, Chef.

23:15.169 --> 23:17.938
You know, the dish,
it's a little homey.

23:17.972 --> 23:19.573
- Right.
- Which is nice.

23:19.607 --> 23:21.309
Is it nice in
the MasterChef kitchen?

23:21.342 --> 23:23.611
I-- I think so.

23:23.644 --> 23:25.046
I'm not so sure.

23:29.783 --> 23:32.486
Shanika, what's the dish?

23:32.520 --> 23:33.754
This is a bitter French kiss.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.257
I have a puff pastry

23:36.290 --> 23:38.092
stuffed with a goat cheese
filling,

23:38.126 --> 23:39.627
that was made
with cream cheese,

23:39.660 --> 23:41.362
heavy whipping cream,
sugar, and date.

23:41.395 --> 23:43.131
I did a balsamic vinegar
reduction,

23:43.164 --> 23:45.299
and I created a candied bacon
rosette.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.101
You're playing on
a high wire,

23:47.135 --> 23:50.438
because you're using very,
very risky ingredients.

23:50.471 --> 23:52.806
Goat cheese, and balsamic,
and candied bacon.

23:52.840 --> 23:56.010
Without the greatest
of finesse and skill,

23:56.044 --> 23:58.179
you're gonna fall
off that wire.

24:12.593 --> 24:14.728
Shanika,
I'm so impressed.

24:14.762 --> 24:17.398
The fact that you got
that puff pastry cooked
all the way through.

24:17.431 --> 24:19.733
If you're a goat
cheese lover,

24:19.767 --> 24:21.202
then this is
the dessert for you.

24:34.915 --> 24:36.417
Ladies, let me remind you,

24:36.450 --> 24:40.088
you only have to impress
one of us to win an apron.

24:40.121 --> 24:43.257
You might have multiple offers
and it's down to you to choose

24:43.291 --> 24:45.259
who you want to be your mentor

24:45.293 --> 24:48.062
throughout this whole
competition.

24:48.096 --> 24:50.131
I've made my decision.

24:51.399 --> 24:52.966
Cynthia...

24:55.069 --> 24:57.705
your dish, for me,

24:57.738 --> 24:59.140
is not worthy of my apron.

25:01.075 --> 25:04.245
Well done, Cynthia...

25:04.278 --> 25:05.946
but I'm afraid
it's a no for me.

25:07.915 --> 25:09.617
Cynthia, I'm looking
at that dish

25:09.650 --> 25:13.354
and I'm thinking about
is it "MasterChef"-worthy?

25:13.387 --> 25:15.189
And the answer is no,

25:15.223 --> 25:16.790
so I'm not gonna give
you one of my aprons.

25:16.824 --> 25:18.592
Thank you, Chef.

25:18.626 --> 25:22.130
Shanika, I know you want
my apron, right?

25:22.163 --> 25:23.164
Yes.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.939
I'm sorry to say, I just don't
think you're ready yet.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.576
Okay.

25:35.609 --> 25:38.146
- Shanika.
- Yes, sir.

25:38.179 --> 25:40.781
Gordon doesn't believe in you.
Why should I?

25:40.814 --> 25:42.616
Because I know
I have the potential.

25:42.650 --> 25:45.119
I know I have the drive,
I have the hunger.

25:45.153 --> 25:47.821
And I will win.

25:54.328 --> 25:55.963
I look at you
and I see promise.

25:55.996 --> 26:00.401
I see a future
and I do believe in you.

26:00.434 --> 26:02.069
So I do wanna give you
this apron.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.705
- I want it.
- Wow!

26:13.147 --> 26:14.982
- Shanika.
- Yes, sir.

26:15.015 --> 26:18.619
If I offered you this apron,

26:18.652 --> 26:23.591
would you take my apron
or would you take Aarón's apron?

26:23.624 --> 26:25.125
I'm gonna go with Aarón.

26:26.327 --> 26:28.095
Hmm.

26:28.128 --> 26:30.531
Well, Shanika,
I don't believe you.

26:30.564 --> 26:33.501
I'm gonna make this
not hypothetical anymore.

26:35.303 --> 26:38.206
I'm gonna count to three,
and then you reach out

26:38.239 --> 26:42.976
and take whichever apron
suits your ambition the most

26:43.010 --> 26:44.978
to prove Gordon wrong.

26:47.548 --> 26:51.685
One, two, three.

26:59.327 --> 27:01.362
Shanika, I'm gonna
count to three

27:01.395 --> 27:04.064
and then you
reach out and take

27:04.097 --> 27:07.535
whichever apron
suits your ambition the most

27:07.568 --> 27:09.670
to prove Gordon wrong.

27:12.206 --> 27:16.777
One, two, three.

27:19.547 --> 27:21.215
Mm.

27:24.885 --> 27:26.587
See you on the camp.

27:31.592 --> 27:35.396
Cynthia, sorry,
you are going home,

27:35.429 --> 27:36.697
but your family should
be proud of you.

27:36.730 --> 27:38.065
Thank you.

27:38.098 --> 27:40.200
Thank you, ladies.

27:43.070 --> 27:45.172
Keep coming, keep trying.

27:45.205 --> 27:47.074
Don't give up.

27:47.107 --> 27:49.610
She's got the animal heart it
takes to win this competition.

27:49.643 --> 27:52.513
- No.
- I'm happy she's not
on my team.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.915
Yeah, that's
'cause you like to lose.

27:54.948 --> 27:57.951
( cheering and applause )

28:04.925 --> 28:07.928
( cheering )

28:13.000 --> 28:15.769
Mommy, I'm so proud!

28:15.803 --> 28:18.406
Props to Shanika.
She went in there
and did her thing

28:18.439 --> 28:20.974
and she had a great dish,

28:21.008 --> 28:22.276
and I'm really proud of her.

28:25.178 --> 28:27.381
What Joe saw was a damn diamond

28:27.415 --> 28:29.317
and MasterChef kitchen
gotta get ready

28:29.350 --> 28:32.219
because I'm bringing the heat,
the flavor, and the sass

28:32.252 --> 28:34.254
all up in that kitchen.

28:34.288 --> 28:36.890
( cheering and applause )

28:36.924 --> 28:41.128
Narrator:
From thousands of home cooks
across America,

28:41.161 --> 28:43.063
the judges invited those
with the skill...

28:43.096 --> 28:44.932
- Flambé it.
- There you go.

28:44.965 --> 28:47.801
- determination, and courage...
- Let's do this!

28:47.835 --> 28:49.937
- Were you chopping garlic
that fast?
- Absolutely.

28:49.970 --> 28:53.173
- Keep the knuckles out the way.
- ...to take risks...

28:53.206 --> 28:55.643
- This is not doing
what I need it to do.
- No, it's not.

28:55.676 --> 28:59.447
Cooking an Italian dish in front
of an extraordinary Italian,

28:59.480 --> 29:02.416
- now that's ballsy.
- No!

29:02.450 --> 29:04.251
...but for these home cooks...

29:04.284 --> 29:07.488
That is a crime in Texas.

29:07.521 --> 29:09.790
It's the consistency
of toothpaste.

29:09.823 --> 29:11.459
Looks like a calf's brain.

29:11.492 --> 29:14.094
...the gamble didn't pay off.

29:14.127 --> 29:16.196
Gordon:
You know that this is
not going to you.

29:16.229 --> 29:17.498
I'm afraid it's a no.

29:17.531 --> 29:19.700
- I'm sorry.
- You were close.

29:19.733 --> 29:21.502
- It's a no. No as well.
- No apron.

29:21.535 --> 29:24.137
- Double no.
- Your dish is good.

29:24.171 --> 29:27.307
- Is he gonna give it to him?
- Not good enough.

29:27.341 --> 29:28.842
Ooh!

29:28.876 --> 29:31.278
But for the most
talented home cooks...

29:31.311 --> 29:33.881
- I absolutely love the cook
on the veal.
- Thank you.

29:33.914 --> 29:36.484
...the risk turned
into reward...

29:36.517 --> 29:38.218
That is MasterChef-worthy.

29:38.251 --> 29:40.654
...with Gordon handing out
his second apron...

29:40.688 --> 29:43.557
Congratulations, Seth.

29:43.591 --> 29:45.526
...and Aarón giving out
his first of the night...

29:45.559 --> 29:47.628
- Julia.
- Wow!

29:47.661 --> 29:49.963
...leaving Gordon and Joe
with six aprons each...

29:49.997 --> 29:51.331
( cheering and applause )

29:51.365 --> 29:52.866
...and Aarón with seven.

29:52.900 --> 29:54.234
Team Aarón!
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

29:54.267 --> 29:56.003
Let the games begin,

29:56.036 --> 29:57.671
because this is the highest
level we've ever seen.

29:57.705 --> 30:00.474
Good luck,
because you're gonna need it.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.710
Up next is Samantha...

30:02.743 --> 30:04.812
- I'm so nervous.
- You'll do fine.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.747
- You'll do good.
- I hope so.

30:06.780 --> 30:08.716
...a 20-year-old
college student

30:08.749 --> 30:10.350
from West Des Moines, Iowa.

30:10.384 --> 30:11.585
And voila!

30:11.619 --> 30:12.986
I'm in a sorority,

30:13.020 --> 30:14.555
and I'm kind of the mom
of the group.

30:14.588 --> 30:16.557
You know, after a long night
of partying,

30:16.590 --> 30:18.859
they'll come over to my place,
I'll make hangover food,

30:18.892 --> 30:21.094
and make sure everybody gets
a good meal in.

30:21.128 --> 30:22.530
I wish Dad could see me
right now.

30:22.563 --> 30:23.997
He'd be so proud.

30:24.031 --> 30:26.233
- He is, he's watching.
- He's watching.

30:26.266 --> 30:30.170
My passion for food
and for cooking really came
from my family.

30:30.203 --> 30:32.205
When I was around 15 or 16

30:32.239 --> 30:35.843
my dad got diagnosed with
stage 4 renal cell carcinoma.

30:35.876 --> 30:38.579
So, now that we're apart,
all I can do

30:38.612 --> 30:41.281
is try to make him
incredibly proud of me

30:41.314 --> 30:43.684
by just following my passion.

30:43.717 --> 30:46.454
Being here now
means everything.

30:46.487 --> 30:49.356
I'm going in with Mark.
He's 19,

30:49.389 --> 30:51.058
so we're the two youngest
in the competition.

30:51.091 --> 30:52.593
These people might
be a little older

30:52.626 --> 30:54.094
but they can't cook like me.

30:54.127 --> 30:55.629
My name is Mark
and I am a dishwasher.

30:55.663 --> 30:57.731
I grew up in Rockport, Maine.

30:57.765 --> 31:00.067
We lived on a farmhouse-esque
property.

31:00.100 --> 31:03.270
We had a top floor living space
and a bottom floor restaurant.

31:03.303 --> 31:06.206
( cheering and applause )

31:06.239 --> 31:07.608
Growing up in a restaurant
at such a young age

31:07.641 --> 31:09.142
really did steep me
in the culture

31:09.176 --> 31:12.412
and the respect it takes
to succeed in the kitchen.

31:12.446 --> 31:14.114
I'm an expert
in flavor profiles.

31:14.147 --> 31:16.149
I'm well-schooled
in the art of butchery.

31:16.183 --> 31:19.219
- Come on down, please.
- I've been in food
my whole life,

31:19.252 --> 31:22.289
so I'm confident
that today I'll be taking home
a MasterChef apron.

31:22.322 --> 31:23.924
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:23.957 --> 31:27.060
Welcome. Both of you
have got 30 minutes

31:27.094 --> 31:30.898
to absolutely nail
your signature dishes.

31:30.931 --> 31:34.502
Your 30 minutes starts...

31:35.936 --> 31:36.904
now!

31:36.937 --> 31:38.038
Let's go.

31:43.043 --> 31:45.278
Good knife skills.
Look at that.

31:45.312 --> 31:47.848
- He's spent some time
in the kitchen.
- Aarón: Mm-hmm.

31:47.881 --> 31:50.250
Samantha, give us an insight
to what you're making.

31:50.283 --> 31:52.452
The dish I'm preparing tonight
is a chicken piccata

31:52.486 --> 31:56.323
with roasted asparagus
and a potato puree.

31:56.356 --> 31:58.626
I make it a lot
for my sorority sisters.

31:58.659 --> 32:00.794
But leaving here tonight with
an apron, what would that mean?

32:00.828 --> 32:02.630
That would mean
everything to me.

32:02.663 --> 32:05.866
I dropped all of my classes.

32:05.899 --> 32:07.134
Pretty much gave up everything
to be here.

32:07.167 --> 32:08.368
Gordon:
Wow! Incredible.

32:08.401 --> 32:10.337
Good luck.

32:10.370 --> 32:12.405
10 minutes gone,
20 minutes to go.

32:14.875 --> 32:17.177
So, Mark, give us an insight
to the dish.

32:17.210 --> 32:19.479
I'm making a lamb chop
with sautéed asparagus,

32:19.513 --> 32:21.682
a potato stack
and a cauliflower puree.

32:21.715 --> 32:23.651
So, Mark, what do you do
for a living?

32:23.684 --> 32:26.219
I'm a dishwasher
at my mother's restaurant
in Rockport, Maine.

32:26.253 --> 32:27.821
Gordon:
Why not culinary school?

32:27.855 --> 32:29.356
Well, I find
that I've learned enough

32:29.389 --> 32:32.025
in my own field, personally,
independently,

32:32.059 --> 32:35.362
- Wow!
- and just as well
through my own experience.

32:35.395 --> 32:37.965
I'm one of the more talented
people in this room.

32:37.998 --> 32:40.701
Even at 19 years old,
you feel you're
above the class.

32:40.734 --> 32:42.502
- Absolutely.
- Self-confident.

32:45.573 --> 32:47.675
A lot of similarities
between Mark's story
and mine.

32:47.708 --> 32:51.144
I also grew up washing dishes
and peeling potatoes,

32:51.178 --> 32:53.914
and I can tell,
by the way he moves

32:53.947 --> 32:55.515
and the confidence
in the way he touches
a pan or food,

32:55.549 --> 32:58.285
that that kid has spent time
in a restaurant.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.989
Aarón: One of the things
that excites me about Samantha

33:02.022 --> 33:04.357
is she's gotten her pans
nice and hot,

33:04.391 --> 33:07.227
and she's allowing the pan
to do the work for her.

33:07.260 --> 33:09.229
creating a beautiful crust.

33:09.262 --> 33:11.665
This is always very risky.
She's adding wine.

33:11.699 --> 33:14.267
Let's see if she knows to burn
the alcohol out of the wine.

33:16.436 --> 33:17.671
- Lamb's out.
- Oh!

33:17.705 --> 33:19.539
Lamb is out.

33:19.573 --> 33:22.275
Two and a half minutes
remaining.

33:22.309 --> 33:24.945
I don't think that lamb's
gonna rest in time.

33:28.582 --> 33:32.019
60 seconds remaining.

33:32.052 --> 33:33.754
- This is it.
- Come on, finish strong.

33:33.787 --> 33:35.555
Put it on the plate.

33:35.589 --> 33:37.691
Aarón: Come on, Mark.
It has to be immaculate

33:37.725 --> 33:39.893
and gorgeous, those plates.

33:39.927 --> 33:42.562
25 seconds to go.
Come on, let's go.

33:42.596 --> 33:45.098
He has nothing plated.

33:45.132 --> 33:47.134
What is he doing?

33:53.306 --> 33:54.875
Come on, Mark.
Let's go.

33:54.908 --> 33:58.145
It has to be immaculate
and gorgeous, those plates.

33:58.178 --> 34:00.914
25 seconds to go.
Come on, let's go.

34:00.948 --> 34:03.450
He has nothing plated.

34:03.483 --> 34:04.752
What is he doing?

34:08.155 --> 34:09.222
Gordon:
Ten, nine...

34:09.256 --> 34:13.160
Chefs:
Eight, seven, six,

34:13.193 --> 34:17.130
five, four, three, two, one.

34:17.164 --> 34:19.733
- Gordon: And stop. Well done.
- Joe: Hands in the air.

34:19.767 --> 34:21.468
- Good job.
- Whoo!

34:21.501 --> 34:23.270
- Well done.
- Thank you.

34:23.303 --> 34:25.873
Very carefully, please bring
your dishes down to the front.

34:37.217 --> 34:39.653
So, Samantha,
describe the dish, please.

34:39.687 --> 34:42.856
So today I have for you
a chicken piccata

34:42.890 --> 34:47.094
with potato puree
and oven-roasted asparagus.

34:47.127 --> 34:49.797
Just from the outside,
you got a beautiful color on it.

34:49.830 --> 34:52.700
Do you like the citrus level
that you have in that sauce?

34:52.733 --> 34:55.002
- Did you put enough
lemon juice?
- I-- I believe I did.

34:55.035 --> 34:56.436
I got citrus from the wine

34:56.469 --> 34:58.839
and then I got citrus
from the lemon juice.

35:03.076 --> 35:05.378
The chicken's moist.

35:05.412 --> 35:07.447
That skin is rendered
down beautifully.

35:07.480 --> 35:09.182
Love how it's seasoned.

35:09.216 --> 35:10.818
I think you did a great job
creating texture.

35:10.851 --> 35:12.485
On the outside
there's a beautiful crust.

35:12.519 --> 35:14.888
You're suffering
from one major thing.

35:14.922 --> 35:16.890
You didn't cook out
the wine enough.

35:22.062 --> 35:23.964
Skin is incredible.

35:23.997 --> 35:26.700
A little bit of naiveté
on the asparagus peeling them,

35:26.734 --> 35:28.902
when they should
be just roasted whole.

35:28.936 --> 35:31.638
Puree needs a touch
more lift,

35:31.671 --> 35:33.073
but you cooked the chicken
beautifully.

35:33.106 --> 35:36.143
I can't believe
that it's so flavorsome.

35:36.176 --> 35:37.244
Thank you.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.916
You know, I would ask you,

35:42.950 --> 35:45.953
"Did I order a chicken piccata
or a glass of Chardonnay?"

35:48.221 --> 35:50.557
- Good chicken, though.
- Thank you.

35:53.727 --> 35:57.097
Mark, describe the dish, please.

35:57.130 --> 36:00.734
I have a pan-roasted lamb chop
with a crispy potato stack,

36:00.768 --> 36:04.337
a cauliflower puree
and sautéed asparagus.

36:04.371 --> 36:07.775
So, visually,
what do you think?

36:07.808 --> 36:09.877
- I like how it looks.
- Right.

36:09.910 --> 36:13.113
You're full
of ( bleep ).

36:13.146 --> 36:15.482
You know and I know
that that's undercooked.

36:17.450 --> 36:20.087
However, I look at this bit
of lamb and it's cooked.

36:20.120 --> 36:22.890
But that one there,
you know that's raw.

36:25.793 --> 36:28.028
So, man up a little bit.
Got me?

36:28.061 --> 36:29.997
Absolutely.

36:34.501 --> 36:36.103
The cauliflower doesn't taste
of cauliflower.

36:36.136 --> 36:38.205
It tastes of butter,
it's so rich.

36:38.238 --> 36:40.874
But asparagus is delicious,
potatoes okay. Fine, fried.

36:40.908 --> 36:43.710
However, that lamb is
not cooked properly,

36:43.743 --> 36:47.514
but seasoning is on point
so there's something
there to hold on to.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.721
You know, got a lot of swagger
behind the bench.

36:54.754 --> 36:56.990
You cook like a kid
who's been in a restaurant,

36:57.024 --> 37:00.260
but all the swagger
and technique

37:00.293 --> 37:01.661
has to translate into a dish,

37:01.694 --> 37:04.932
and you definitely
made some errors.

37:04.965 --> 37:09.903
I think that your decision
in butchery was really
kind of what got you wrong.

37:09.937 --> 37:12.305
I mean, this looks
too rough, you know?

37:12.339 --> 37:15.242
You know, bring a little bit
of more true technique.

37:15.275 --> 37:17.744
You know where you learn
that technique?

37:17.777 --> 37:20.013
Exactly the place you said
you didn't need to go.

37:20.047 --> 37:21.781
Culinary school.

37:30.958 --> 37:32.993
The seasoning is
right there.

37:33.026 --> 37:35.028
The cook doesn't really
upset me that much.

37:35.062 --> 37:37.297
I just think
the lack of imagination

37:37.330 --> 37:38.866
with some
of the other elements

37:38.899 --> 37:41.734
is what's a little
disappointing.

37:44.504 --> 37:48.041
Each of us only started out
with eight aprons to give out.

37:48.075 --> 37:52.846
Joe and I have already handed
out two aprons each.

37:52.880 --> 37:55.315
Aarón has handed one apron.

37:55.348 --> 37:59.219
Joe, do you have an apron
to give out?

37:59.252 --> 38:01.889
It's a huge investment for me.

38:04.757 --> 38:06.659
- But I think I'm a no.
- Gordon: No.

38:06.693 --> 38:09.562
Aarón.

38:09.596 --> 38:11.298
Nope.

38:11.331 --> 38:14.534
I saw a lot of bright spots,
for sure.

38:14.567 --> 38:17.337
I'm just concerned
about the lack of experience.

38:17.370 --> 38:20.140
Gordon:
I disagree,

38:20.173 --> 38:23.310
because what I see
is someone down there

38:23.343 --> 38:25.612
with tremendous potential.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.554
That apron...

38:35.755 --> 38:36.957
goes to...

38:42.795 --> 38:44.431
( whispering )
Please.

38:51.704 --> 38:56.776
What I see is someone down there
with tremendous potential.

39:03.316 --> 39:04.784
That apron...

39:06.920 --> 39:08.121
goes to...

39:14.627 --> 39:16.596
( whispering )
Please.

39:21.468 --> 39:24.537
( cheering and applause )

39:24.571 --> 39:26.573
( screaming )

39:34.781 --> 39:37.884
Mark, come back next year.

39:37.917 --> 39:40.420
- Okay.
- Head up high.

39:40.453 --> 39:41.654
Thank you.

39:45.092 --> 39:47.627
Mark.
Hold on a second.

39:50.297 --> 39:52.499
You know, I'm an entrepreneur.

39:52.532 --> 39:54.267
I'm a business man,
I'm a restaurateur.

39:54.301 --> 39:59.506
I invest my money in people,
in restaurants to get a return,

39:59.539 --> 40:02.675
and I thought
you were investable

40:02.709 --> 40:04.677
for a minute.

40:04.711 --> 40:08.081
And then it all
kind of fell apart.

40:08.115 --> 40:12.119
And I thought maybe,
with my mentorship,

40:12.152 --> 40:14.988
I could bring him to even win
this whole competition.

40:15.022 --> 40:17.090
You got the skills.

40:17.124 --> 40:19.092
You remind me
of myself.

40:19.126 --> 40:22.996
But every investment
is a deal.

40:23.030 --> 40:26.966
If I invest in
you with an apron...

40:29.002 --> 40:31.604
you would have to take
direction and listen to me

40:31.638 --> 40:34.774
as you compete to win.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.611
And if you broke
that deal,

40:38.645 --> 40:41.214
the consequences
would be severe.

40:43.683 --> 40:45.818
You should really
think deep now,

40:45.852 --> 40:48.621
because maybe you should
do what Gordon said.

40:48.655 --> 40:53.226
Leave, hone your skills,
come back another year.

40:53.260 --> 40:57.397
Mark, only take
this apron from me

40:57.430 --> 41:01.734
if you are ready
to do what it takes.

41:02.902 --> 41:05.238
It's your decision.

41:18.051 --> 41:20.053
( cheering and applause )

41:21.288 --> 41:22.555
Marky!

41:23.590 --> 41:26.693
( screaming )

41:26.726 --> 41:28.861
Whoo!

41:28.895 --> 41:30.830
Joe must've seen something
in me.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.100
He struck me a deal
and I took it

41:33.133 --> 41:35.502
and I couldn't be more honored
and grateful for that man

41:35.535 --> 41:36.936
and what he saw in me
to give me the apron.

41:36.969 --> 41:39.339
Good job!

41:39.372 --> 41:41.374
I owe it to myself,
and more than ever to him,

41:41.408 --> 41:42.842
to make it to the finale now.

41:42.875 --> 41:47.247
Your Marky got an apron!

41:47.280 --> 41:49.282
The kid, I'm dealing
with raw talent here.

41:49.316 --> 41:50.617
I'm gonna put myself
on the line

41:50.650 --> 41:51.918
and bring him to win
this competition.

41:51.951 --> 41:53.620
- You watch.
- Hold on a minute.

41:53.653 --> 41:55.288
Now you're saying
he's gonna win it?

41:55.322 --> 41:57.023
- He's gonna win it.
- Now you're dreaming.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.426
Maybe he got sick
from eating that raw lamb.

42:02.795 --> 42:04.864
Narrator:
Next time...

42:04.897 --> 42:06.099
Game on, boys.

42:06.133 --> 42:08.468
...17 white aprons remain

42:08.501 --> 42:10.303
as the judges' battle
to find

42:10.337 --> 42:12.805
America's next MasterChef
continues.

42:12.839 --> 42:15.308
I'm certain that they're gonna
pick me and not you.

42:15.342 --> 42:18.077
And the competition heats up...

42:18.111 --> 42:19.812
- Oh, whoops!
- He's all yours, man.

42:19.846 --> 42:22.615
...with some of the most
talented home cooks...

42:22.649 --> 42:25.485
- ( whispering ) That's good.
- ...the MasterChef kitchen
has ever seen.

42:25.518 --> 42:28.788
Three aprons,
but let me tell you,

42:28.821 --> 42:32.625
I can get you
to the MasterChef finale.
