00:02.417 --> 00:05.166
Thank you for your
belief in me.

00:05.166 --> 00:07.125
I just wanted to see what
you were gonna pull off next.

00:09.166 --> 00:10.500
They have hired
one of the premier

00:10.500 --> 00:12.333
'sports litigators

00:12.333 --> 00:14.000
You let 'em hire my ex-wife?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.834
- So you two are together?
- Yes, we are together.

00:16.834 --> 00:18.834
I hope he makes you every bit
as happy as he made me.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.333
That woman wants us dead.

00:21.333 --> 00:22.375
You picked up on that,
did you?

00:23.625 --> 00:25.333
- What's this?
- My number.

00:25.333 --> 00:28.500

'Ms. Monroe violated
the student honor code.'

00:30.959 --> 00:32.250
I'm gonna come clean.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.500
It was my name on the paper

00:33.500 --> 00:35.000
my responsibility.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.417
She's to be given a failing
grade in the class.

00:37.417 --> 00:38.500
Why don't I know
dad wrote music?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.000
You think I wouldn't
be interested?

00:40.000 --> 00:42.041
Can we please
change the subject?

00:42.041 --> 00:44.208
Do you guys...still
sell these here?

00:44.208 --> 00:46.375
'They belong to a musician
I'm trying to track down.'

00:46.375 --> 00:48.208
Rex...Perkins.

00:48.208 --> 00:50.208
It's not in the database.
Sorry, I couldn't help you.

00:50.208 --> 00:52.041
- Oh, my God.
- What? What is it?

00:52.041 --> 00:53.583
This is my dad's set list.

00:53.583 --> 00:55.750

did you get this?

was playing a gig'

00:57.667 --> 00:59.583

you told me he died.

00:59.583 --> 01:01.375
He thought the world
of you, Marti.

I'm just overworked.

But I promise you,
my head's in the squad.

02:14.291 --> 02:16.291
Hey, you.

02:16.291 --> 02:18.917
Mmm. So, here's
my plan for tonight.

02:18.917 --> 02:22.125
We hop a flight to Paris, buy
a little villa on the left bank

02:22.125 --> 02:23.500
spend the rest of
our lives teaching

02:23.500 --> 02:26.083
cats and dogs to love
one another.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.500
Backup plan is
pizza and a movie.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.125
We're going to Paris?
What?

02:30.291 --> 02:32.125
Okay...what's up?

02:33.875 --> 02:37.458
I got my scholarship revoked.
So there's that.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.542
Wait, how the hell did
you lose your sch--

02:38.542 --> 02:40.875
Shh! Keep your voice down.

02:42.500 --> 02:43.959
Okay.

02:43.959 --> 02:45.458
When I owned up to copying
that term paper

02:45.458 --> 02:47.333
it gave me an "F"
in the course.

02:47.333 --> 02:49.333
My GPA dropped below
"C" average

02:49.333 --> 02:51.667
which is a requirement
for the Hellcats scholarship.

02:51.667 --> 02:53.708
Below a "C"?
Below a "C" is a "D."

02:53.708 --> 02:56.333
Look, okay, I'm a bad student,
but I now the alphabet.

02:56.333 --> 02:59.333
Savannah, you're smart.
Why are your grades so bad?

02:59.333 --> 03:02.125
Well, I consider myself
a cheerleading major.

03:02.125 --> 03:03.667
That's what I wanna
do with my life.

03:03.667 --> 03:05.333
Open a cheer gym,
lobby to get cheer

03:05.333 --> 03:06.542

03:06.542 --> 03:08.542
The other things

03:08.542 --> 03:10.333

03:10.333 --> 03:12.750
Running a business requires
math and economics.

03:12.750 --> 03:15.500
Uh, lobbyists need to understand
politics and the law.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.875
Okay, can you stop being
rational and just

03:16.875 --> 03:18.125
hug me or something?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.291
Sorry.

03:22.667 --> 03:24.917
Okay.

03:24.917 --> 03:26.959
You're right.

03:26.959 --> 03:28.375
I should have kept
my grades up.

03:31.166 --> 03:34.542
Now...I have to figure out
how to pay tuition.

03:34.542 --> 03:36.000
Maybe you can ask
your parents.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.708
My mom and I have come
a long way this year

03:37.708 --> 03:40.166
but no way she pays to send
me to a secular school.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.542
Okay.
Then start with your dad.

03:41.542 --> 03:43.375
He'll be flattered you came
to him first.

03:43.375 --> 03:45.417
Get him on your side
then together

03:45.417 --> 03:46.542
you outflank your mom.

03:46.542 --> 03:47.583
Um, that's sneaky.

03:47.583 --> 03:49.542
I grew up with four brothers.

03:49.542 --> 03:52.542
You gotta game the system or
someone else eats your dessert.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.041
Your brothers seem so nice.

03:54.041 --> 03:55.542
Dude, they would eat a baby

03:55.542 --> 03:57.750
if you dipped it
in chocolate.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.208
Your mother's head
is gonna explode.

03:59.208 --> 04:00.417
You know that, right?

04:01.542 --> 04:03.375
It was a moment of weakness.

04:03.375 --> 04:06.542
Well, it was a little
more than that.

04:06.542 --> 04:07.917
The fact that you cheated
is gonna confirm

04:07.917 --> 04:09.542
every unfair opinion
your mother's

04:09.542 --> 04:11.625
ever had about
secular schools.

04:11.625 --> 04:14.041
And all that progress you've
made in the last few months.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.583
- Kaput.
- I know.

04:16.583 --> 04:18.583
I'm sorry.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.000
I wish I could do it
all over again.

04:21.791 --> 04:23.417
H-how are you gonna pay

04:23.417 --> 04:25.750
for your college education?

04:25.750 --> 04:28.417
Well, I've, I've
put together a plan.

04:28.417 --> 04:30.750
'Um...'

04:30.750 --> 04:32.750
Line 36 is the bare
minimum I need

04:32.750 --> 04:35.417
'for tuition, housing,
and incidentals.'

04:35.417 --> 04:38.583
Column "C" is the projected
income from specialty

04:38.583 --> 04:41.041
scholarships and taking
on two part-time jobs

04:41.041 --> 04:43.875
which leaves me with a
monthly shortfall of $200.

04:43.875 --> 04:45.583
If you can pick up that
extra, I promise

04:45.583 --> 04:46.667
I will return every penny...

04:47.750 --> 04:49.583
...when I can.

04:49.583 --> 04:51.583
It may not be for a while.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.125
You're gonna hold down...
two jobs?

04:54.125 --> 04:56.625
Yes, I've arranged
one here at The Rat

04:56.625 --> 05:00.458
and I know a lot of people
in the athletic department.

05:00.458 --> 05:03.083
And, uh, when are you gonna
have time for studying?

05:03.083 --> 05:04.083
I'll make time.

05:05.625 --> 05:07.500
And practicing cheerleading?

05:10.458 --> 05:12.500
I don't know.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.291
I guess I'm gonna have
to give it up for a while.

05:14.291 --> 05:16.500
[laughs]

05:16.500 --> 05:19.250
Oh, you giving up
cheerleading?

05:19.250 --> 05:20.667
I don't have any other choice.

05:25.917 --> 05:28.000
Oh, Savannah.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.458
You have been very good
to your family this year.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.458
- How do you mean?
- Well, uh...

05:33.458 --> 05:35.166
You've worked so hard to make
peace with your mother

05:35.166 --> 05:38.667
and believe me, that makes
my life a whole lot easier.

05:38.667 --> 05:40.667
And, uh, you have been
a rock for your sister

05:40.667 --> 05:42.500
all throughout her pregnancy.

05:42.500 --> 05:45.667
And now you're throwing her
a surprise baby shower.

05:45.667 --> 05:48.500
I just think it's time
that your family

05:48.500 --> 05:49.667
did something nice for you.

05:51.667 --> 05:52.667
What?

05:54.500 --> 05:58.667
From now on, your only job
is keeping your grades up.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.125
'Ah'

06:00.125 --> 06:02.667
And bringing home the gold
at Nationals.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.500
Wow, dad.

06:07.500 --> 06:10.500
You work for the city, where do
you get this kind of money?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.667
A few side projects
have started to pay off.

06:13.667 --> 06:14.708
What do you think
mom's gonna say?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.708
Well, now, I've lived with
your mother for 25 years

06:17.708 --> 06:19.333
you let me worry about that.

06:20.875 --> 06:23.375
[instrumental music]

06:28.375 --> 06:31.125
There's that hot law
professor of yours.

06:32.750 --> 06:34.542
He was my law professor
last semester

06:34.542 --> 06:37.000
and now he's just...a guy.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.333
You know, just...nice guy.

06:40.333 --> 06:42.708
- Have a little crush, do we?
- No, I don't have a crush.

06:42.708 --> 06:45.708
- He's just a guy. Nice guy.
- Mom, stop.

06:45.708 --> 06:48.000
- Miss Perkins.
- Hi.

06:49.583 --> 06:52.542
- Mrs. Perkins.
- The pleasure is ours.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.708
I've got to be in court so we're
gonna have to make this brief--

06:54.708 --> 06:56.708
Oh, speak freely, counselor.

06:56.708 --> 06:58.834
My daughter and I
have no secrets.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.792
Uh...

07:02.792 --> 07:04.375
We should discuss
this privately.

07:04.375 --> 07:05.792
Ooh, now you got me curious.

07:07.417 --> 07:09.208
I asked him if he'd
do a background check

07:09.208 --> 07:11.583
on dad, okay?

07:11.583 --> 07:12.750
Try to find some records
of what happened

07:12.750 --> 07:13.750
to him after he left us.

07:13.750 --> 07:15.000
I see.

07:16.750 --> 07:19.375
So, Rex...is he alive?

07:19.375 --> 07:22.250
Ahem.
Well, that's inconclusive.

07:22.250 --> 07:24.834
After he left
the two of you in '93

07:24.834 --> 07:26.792
Wanda divorced him
in Absentia.

07:26.792 --> 07:29.417
Best 300 bucks I ever spent.

07:29.417 --> 07:33.375
Then he drifted around Memphis
and got into some trouble

07:33.375 --> 07:35.959
and did a stretch in a court
ordered rehab program.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.166
When he got out,
he stayed clean

07:40.166 --> 07:43.000
and...he got remarried.

07:49.166 --> 07:51.625
He...had a wife after me?

07:52.959 --> 07:54.625
Are you sure you wanna
know about all this?

07:54.625 --> 07:55.875
We need to know.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.458
Rex's second wife...

08:03.458 --> 08:06.625
...died in 2005.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.708
'And there are no more reports
about him after that.'

08:11.417 --> 08:13.792
There is...one other thing.

08:13.792 --> 08:14.708
I can handle it.

08:18.166 --> 08:21.000
- I-I know this girl.
- You do?

08:21.000 --> 08:24.208
Yeah, she, um, she works
at, at the music shop

08:25.917 --> 08:28.500

with anything?'

08:46.834 --> 08:47.834

right to my face.

I just don't get it.

09:28.708 --> 09:31.875
Well, clearly,
Lewis is slumming.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.500
Yeah, he does that.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.875
Look at all those months
he spent with you.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.500
Don't cut yourself on
that sharp wit of yours.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.875
Okay! Neutral corners,
please.

09:41.875 --> 09:42.875
Let's get out of here.

09:44.583 --> 09:48.125
Uh, what is it
between you and them?

09:50.917 --> 09:53.083
With Alice I think
it's obvious.

09:53.083 --> 09:55.208
Okay, she has no
claim on me. Heh.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.000
And Savannah and I
have history.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.542
Ancient history.

10:02.542 --> 10:05.583
Okay, what's that mean?

Total relapse.

Plus, he started bringing
his junkie girlfriends home.

21:29.792 --> 21:30.875
I don't know, maybe
he was looking for

21:30.875 --> 21:35.250
a replacement for my mom.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.625
One night he never came back.

21:38.291 --> 21:40.250

Sorry, I ran from you.

A shrink once told me I have an
avoidant personality disorder.

22:05.792 --> 22:07.667
I stopped seeing her.

So I guess it proves
she was right.

It's a good guitar.
Gotta love that.

Yeah, I get really
desperate, I can sell it.

22:29.500 --> 22:32.375

from Rex, too.

something to do with this?

Could be.

the whole thing together.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.875
Yeah, this one was getting
suspicious about her surprise

23:12.875 --> 23:14.542

fake invites

You look just like Rex.

23:41.792 --> 23:42.959

23:49.750 --> 23:52.375
Rex was very handsome

a bottle in his face.

I knew this was a bad idea--

in Nashville.

anything about tuition.

I decided what she doesn't
know won't hurt her.

- Dad!
- I can handle your mother.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.291
Trust me.
Did you deposit the check?

25:19.291 --> 25:21.542
Yeah, but the bank put
a three-day hold on it.

25:22.875 --> 25:24.250

it's standard procedure

you say, I'll still

- Those cheesy bolo ties.
- Oh, I hated those.

- Oh, it was so satisfying.
- Wait, he wore a bolo ties?

25:50.250 --> 25:52.375
Yeah, like the fake
cowboy he was.

25:52.375 --> 25:56.041
He saw Springsteen wore one on
the cover of "Tunnel of Love."

I remember he had
that album on vinyl.

25:57.875 --> 25:59.083

the bandwagon with you guys.

I mean, I don't have any
memories of bolo ties

26:18.875 --> 26:21.542

Rex is, is a concept

26:21.542 --> 26:22.959

I've been told

that guitar and this...

Even Emperor Nero
could play the fiddle.

Nero wasn't actually

26:49.375 --> 26:51.750
within the city limits
when Rome was burning.

26:51.750 --> 26:54.083

invented until

- No, back to the spiders, okay?

32:39.708 --> 32:42.291
Now, why'd you kill them?

32:42.291 --> 32:43.583
She brought them over one day

32:43.583 --> 32:45.792
because she had
to leave them somewhere

32:45.792 --> 32:48.166
and I was supposed
to feed them live crickets

32:48.166 --> 32:51.375
but...I couldn't bring
myself to do that, so...

32:54.333 --> 32:56.917
I fed them hamburger,
and they sort of died.

calling me a murderer!

kids calling me Nasty Kathy.

33:07.291 --> 33:08.792

33:08.792 --> 33:10.166
Abernathy? What is...

33:10.166 --> 33:13.333
It's a small town in Texas
near Lubbock.

- Nothing.

It wasn't just
what they said

33:18.667 --> 33:21.291
it was how they
were saying it.

33:21.291 --> 33:24.333
It was in this mocking
sing-song voice.

to spray me with...

breaking up.

the spiders.

rid of them
