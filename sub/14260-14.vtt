01:08.635 --> 01:10.802
What's that?

01:10.804 --> 01:11.836
Guys?

01:11.838 --> 01:14.506
Oh, that's right.
They went out.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.307
[alarm continues]

01:17.710 --> 01:19.310
What in the world?

01:19.312 --> 01:22.080
It sounds like a...
distress signal.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.482
Hello. Can you hear me?

01:24.484 --> 01:25.717
Oh, great.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.853
Someone could be
in terrible trouble.

01:27.855 --> 01:31.223
Oh, where's that portable
tracker of Donatello's?

01:33.292 --> 01:34.993
Ah, found it.
Uh-oh!

01:34.995 --> 01:36.661
Whoa!
[thud]

01:37.697 --> 01:40.265
[electricity sizzles]

01:45.837 --> 01:47.572
I'll clean this up later.

01:47.574 --> 01:50.541
I've got to find
the source of that signal!

01:52.344 --> 01:55.246
Master Splinter,
I've got a-- Oh.

01:55.248 --> 01:56.947
I'd better not
disturb the sensei

01:56.949 --> 01:58.683
while he's
meditating.

02:01.320 --> 02:05.289
Man, that new
video arcade
is totally awesome!

02:05.291 --> 02:07.859
Yeah. Bet my giant lizard
ate more buildings

02:07.861 --> 02:09.160
than your
three-headed dragon.

02:09.162 --> 02:10.394
Oh, yeah?

02:10.395 --> 02:12.964
Well, my super
space destroyer
blew up more planets

02:12.966 --> 02:14.499
than your ultra
star cruiser.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.233
Hey, dudes, don't forget

02:16.235 --> 02:19.036
my Kung Fu streetfighter
kicked down more doors

02:19.038 --> 02:20.739
than your evil
crime lord.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.575
Isn't it nice to have
a place where you can relax

02:23.577 --> 02:25.844
and forget the cares
of the day?

02:25.846 --> 02:28.246
Hey, Leonardo,
you should've been there.

02:28.248 --> 02:29.914
It-- huh? Where'd he go?

02:29.916 --> 02:31.382
Anybody
seen Leonardo?

02:31.384 --> 02:32.983
No sign of him here, dude.

02:32.985 --> 02:34.151
Hey guys,

02:34.153 --> 02:36.754
better take
a look at this.

02:38.757 --> 02:40.825
Holy guacamole!

02:40.827 --> 02:42.227
What happened here?

02:42.229 --> 02:44.262
[Raphael]
Whoa. If I didn't
know better,

02:44.264 --> 02:45.697
I'd say
there'd been a fight.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.432
But what happened
to Leonardo?

02:47.434 --> 02:50.335
I don't know,
but here's his TurtleCom!

02:50.337 --> 02:52.269
He'd never leave
without it.

02:52.271 --> 02:54.039
Unless he was
dragged off!

02:54.041 --> 02:55.706
Guys, I don't like this.

02:55.708 --> 02:58.409
We'd better start
looking for him.

02:58.411 --> 03:00.345
[Krang]
Of all the places

03:00.347 --> 03:03.281
the Technodrome's
ever been stranded,

03:03.283 --> 03:06.618
this is, without a doubt,
the most boring!

03:06.620 --> 03:10.421
There must be some kind
of evil I can get into

03:10.423 --> 03:13.658
somewhere on this
forsaken planet!

03:13.660 --> 03:15.994
[beeping]
What the--
I don't believe it.

03:15.996 --> 03:17.061
What is it?

03:17.063 --> 03:20.198
A highly concentrated
source of energy!

03:20.200 --> 03:23.301
Billions and billions
of mega-volts.

03:23.303 --> 03:25.470
[Shredder]
And it's just
outside the city!

03:25.472 --> 03:28.006
Why, there's enough
energy there

03:28.008 --> 03:31.476
to blow the entire planet
off its axis!

03:31.478 --> 03:33.478
So how does that
help us?

03:33.480 --> 03:34.980
Follow me
on this one.

03:34.982 --> 03:38.682
A shift to the Earth's
proximity to the sun

03:38.684 --> 03:42.420
would reverse the entire
climate of the planet.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.689
The polar ice caps
would melt,

03:44.691 --> 03:46.992
and the Technodrome
would be freed!

03:46.994 --> 03:48.659
Exactly.

03:48.661 --> 03:52.697
And the city would be
plunged into a new ice age,

03:52.699 --> 03:56.800
paralyzing it
for our conquest.

03:56.802 --> 03:59.136
So you found
the energy. Huh.

03:59.138 --> 04:01.472
But where you gonna get
a contraption large enough

04:01.474 --> 04:03.541
to jolt the Earth
off its axis?

04:03.543 --> 04:05.677
I already have it.

04:05.679 --> 04:08.279
Follow me.

04:08.281 --> 04:11.549
These are the components
of my Hyper Thruster,

04:11.551 --> 04:13.284
a little project of mine

04:13.286 --> 04:15.787
I whipped up
on a slow day.

04:15.789 --> 04:17.889
The foot soldiers
can transport it

04:17.891 --> 04:20.524
and assemble it
outside the city,

04:20.527 --> 04:23.762
while you and I locate
that energy source.

04:25.030 --> 04:27.531
[Michelangelo]
Still no sign
of Leonardo, dudes.

04:27.533 --> 04:29.600
And without the homing signal
in his TurtleCom,

04:29.602 --> 04:31.336
I can't get a fix on him.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.505
Hey, what's that?
Whoa!

04:34.507 --> 04:35.506
[Michelangelo]
Looks like somebody

04:35.508 --> 04:37.842
broke into that building
big time!

04:37.844 --> 04:39.377
[tires squealing]

04:39.379 --> 04:41.279
[Raphael]
Well, let's
check it out.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.915
"Blowhard
Bubble Gum Company?"

04:43.917 --> 04:46.884
Why would anybody
rob this place?

04:48.153 --> 04:49.987
Maybe they're robbing
the company safe.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.456
Or stealing
some top-secret

04:51.458 --> 04:52.924
manufacturing
equipment.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.893
Or maybe they just
dig bubble gum,

04:54.895 --> 04:56.928
like me.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.228
[pop]

04:58.230 --> 05:00.664
No. There's
the real reason.

05:00.666 --> 05:04.235
[Donatello]
They're stealing
bubble gum baseball cards.

05:04.237 --> 05:07.638
Why, those dirty,
card-cribbing crooks!

05:07.640 --> 05:10.842
Oh, they won't
get away with this!

05:10.844 --> 05:13.077
Baseball card-loving
kids everywhere

05:13.079 --> 05:14.445
are depending on us.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.481
Come on!

05:17.349 --> 05:18.650
[Bebop]
At last,

05:18.652 --> 05:21.819
our baseball card
collection is complete.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.756
A genuine Nolan Ryan!

05:24.758 --> 05:27.458
My life is complete.

05:27.460 --> 05:29.761
[Raphael]
All right, you goons,
hold it!

05:29.763 --> 05:31.696
Those cards belong
in the collections

05:31.698 --> 05:34.131
of all-American
boys and girls,

05:34.133 --> 05:36.434
not in your
germ-ridden hands.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.869
The turtles!

05:37.871 --> 05:39.570
Let's show 'em
how serious

05:39.572 --> 05:42.440
we take our baseball
card collecting.

05:44.310 --> 05:46.510
Oh, you bone domes
won't stop us

05:46.512 --> 05:48.579
from completing
our collections!

05:48.581 --> 05:50.080
Don't you creeps know

05:50.082 --> 05:52.149
that you can't
get the cards...

05:53.519 --> 05:55.887
without the bubble gum!

05:57.022 --> 05:58.656
Ew, yuck!

05:58.658 --> 06:00.925
Mind if I join in?

06:04.062 --> 06:05.496
Oh, no!

06:07.499 --> 06:09.167
Yech!

06:09.169 --> 06:11.336
Pink is my worstest color.

06:12.738 --> 06:14.305
[grunting]
Gotcha!

06:14.307 --> 06:16.140
[both grunting]

06:16.142 --> 06:19.377
I'll teach you turtles
to mess with us!

06:19.379 --> 06:21.145
Yah!
Whoa!

06:22.381 --> 06:23.514
Oof!

06:23.516 --> 06:26.117
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:26.119 --> 06:27.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:27.354 --> 06:28.786
Whoa, whoa,
whoa-- Ugh!

06:30.089 --> 06:32.123
Michelangelo,
buddy!

06:32.125 --> 06:33.257
Are you all right?

06:33.259 --> 06:34.792
Well, I was

06:34.794 --> 06:37.862
until I saw that!
[rumbling]

06:37.864 --> 06:39.197
[turtles]
Whoa!

06:39.199 --> 06:40.565
[crash]

06:40.567 --> 06:42.800
Eek, anybody
know the name

06:42.802 --> 06:44.502
of a good
chiropractor?

06:44.504 --> 06:47.171
I'd rather call
a weight-lifter.

06:47.173 --> 06:49.339
Oh, come on,
guys, push!

06:49.341 --> 06:51.543
[all grunting]

06:51.545 --> 06:53.411
Hey, did you notice?

06:53.413 --> 06:55.379
There's only
one, two,

06:55.381 --> 06:57.381
three of them
turtles.

06:57.383 --> 06:58.449
Uh, yeah.

06:58.451 --> 07:01.419
They usually come
in a handy four-pack.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.154
Man, I wish
Leonardo was here.

07:04.156 --> 07:05.423
Oh, yeah,

07:05.425 --> 07:07.692
and we still
don't have a clue
where he is.

07:07.694 --> 07:09.160
Did you hear that?

07:09.162 --> 07:11.462
Whoo, one of the turtles
is missing.

07:11.464 --> 07:14.298
The boss is gonna want
to know about this!

07:17.803 --> 07:20.571
All together now...
push!

07:20.573 --> 07:23.107
[all grunting]
[thud]

07:23.109 --> 07:24.408
All right!

07:24.410 --> 07:27.478
Now to get
Rocksteady and Bebop!

07:31.316 --> 07:34.586
Aw, they got away
in the transport module.

07:34.588 --> 07:36.086
So what else is new?

07:37.522 --> 07:39.323
Hey, guys,
what did I miss?

07:39.325 --> 07:40.491
Bebop and Rocksteady.

07:40.493 --> 07:42.159
But then again,
so did we.

07:42.161 --> 07:44.295
You four seem
different somehow.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.663
Don't you mean three?

07:45.665 --> 07:47.064
Hey, that's right!

07:47.066 --> 07:48.900
Where's Leonardo?

07:48.902 --> 07:50.702
That's what
we'd like to know.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.171
Let us know if you hear
from him, would you?

07:53.173 --> 07:54.238
I sure will.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.511
There's just
one problem

08:00.513 --> 08:02.579
with this plan
of yours, Krang.

08:02.581 --> 08:04.515
Really?
What's that?

08:04.517 --> 08:06.984
Those blasted
turtles.

08:06.986 --> 08:09.219
Every time we come up
with a workable scheme

08:09.221 --> 08:11.255
to enslave the world,

08:11.257 --> 08:13.891
they show up
and boot our butts
from here to Hoboken.

08:17.129 --> 08:19.630
Boss, have we got
news for you!

08:19.632 --> 08:22.400
[Bebop]
One of the turtles
is missing.

08:22.402 --> 08:24.502
Yeah, and none
of the other turtles

08:24.504 --> 08:26.170
knows where he is.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.705
That's it, Krang--

08:27.707 --> 08:30.441
a way to carry out
your plan without
interference

08:30.443 --> 08:33.578
from those miserable
shellbacks.

08:36.782 --> 08:39.683
[Krang]
The holographic
cloaking machine?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.585
What do you want
with that?

08:41.587 --> 08:43.421
You'll see.

08:43.423 --> 08:45.223
Which one
of the turtles
is missing?

08:45.225 --> 08:48.860
Uh, gee, I don't know.
They all look alike.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.129
It's the one
in the blue mask.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.330
Aha. Leonardo!

08:53.332 --> 08:55.533
Bebop, get in
the holographic cloaker.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.768
Uh, whatever
you say, boss.

08:59.000 --> 09:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here

09:07.245 --> 09:08.779
[Shredder
laughing]

09:08.781 --> 09:11.482
It's perfect!

09:13.685 --> 09:15.085
[Shredder]
Success!

09:15.087 --> 09:17.989
Bebop is now
the image
of Leonardo.

09:17.991 --> 09:21.960
Oh, no, I turned into
one of them turtles!

09:21.962 --> 09:23.394
Calm yourself.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.030
It's merely
a holographic
illusion.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.332
To the transport modules,
everyone!

09:28.334 --> 09:30.734
I'm coming along this time,

09:30.736 --> 09:33.204
to see there are no foul-ups.

09:33.206 --> 09:36.074
If you insist,

09:42.947 --> 09:44.548
Go to the city,

09:44.550 --> 09:46.718
and create as much
trouble as you can.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.987
Remember, you only
have two hours

09:48.989 --> 09:51.455
before your holographic
disguise wears off.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.891
After that, you'll return
to your normal--

09:53.893 --> 09:55.560
sub-normal self.

09:55.562 --> 09:59.329
And while the turtles
are chasing all over town

09:59.331 --> 10:01.265
looking for their
missing friend,

10:01.267 --> 10:05.202
the foot soldiers will be
preparing the Hyper Thruster

10:05.204 --> 10:07.605
to blow this planet's climate

10:07.607 --> 10:11.976
topsy-turvy!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

10:11.978 --> 10:13.745
[water splashing]

10:15.247 --> 10:18.983
Oh, I've been going
around in circles
for hours down here.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.351
If only I could
figure out

10:20.353 --> 10:22.319
how this tracking
device works.

10:22.321 --> 10:23.988
[beeping]
Well, what
do you know?

10:23.990 --> 10:26.724
That must be the source
of the distress signal.

10:26.726 --> 10:30.027
It seems to be coming
from outside the city.

10:31.230 --> 10:32.796
This auto showroom

10:32.798 --> 10:34.765
looks like a good
place to start.

10:36.234 --> 10:37.702
Okay.
[snorting]

10:37.704 --> 10:39.102
Here I go.

10:39.104 --> 10:41.338
Hey, and here
we have the new Hula.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.841
It almost wiggles its way
through traffic jams.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.109
[bang]

10:48.046 --> 10:50.815
I wanna take this baby
for a spin.

10:52.751 --> 10:55.052
Hey, that's our most
expensive car!

10:55.054 --> 10:57.121
Please, don't!

10:57.123 --> 10:59.123
Hey, hey, are you nuts?

10:59.125 --> 11:02.526
A celebrity endorsement
from a hero like me

11:02.528 --> 11:04.228
could be worth millions,

11:04.230 --> 11:06.464
maybe even thousands.

11:06.466 --> 11:07.632
[ignition starts]

11:07.634 --> 11:09.000
Whoa-ho!

11:09.002 --> 11:11.035
I'm a Turbo-turtle!

11:11.037 --> 11:13.671
Out of the way,
you roadhogs!

11:13.673 --> 11:15.272
[tires squealing]

11:17.710 --> 11:21.279
Make way
for the Ninja Turtle!

11:23.916 --> 11:25.850
Uh, well, I'm sorry,

11:25.852 --> 11:28.753
but a beloved
crimefighter such as me

11:28.755 --> 11:33.558
needs a vehicle with
a bit more endurance.

11:33.560 --> 11:36.527
Oh, oh, oh, no!

11:36.529 --> 11:37.795
[laughing, snorting]

11:37.797 --> 11:39.764
Oh, boy, this is fun!

11:39.766 --> 11:40.831
Hee hee, yeah.

11:40.833 --> 11:44.102
Let's find some more
stuff to mess up.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.770
[Michelangelo]
Bummer, compadres.

11:45.772 --> 11:48.038
We've scoped out
this entire city,

11:48.040 --> 11:50.073
and no sign
of Leonardo!

11:50.075 --> 11:52.410
My students,
is there some problem?

11:52.412 --> 11:54.111
There sure is,
Master Splinter.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.512
Leonardo is missing!

11:55.514 --> 11:58.416
Yeah, and we think he might
be in some kind of trouble.

11:58.418 --> 12:01.018
Join hands,
my students.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.753
We will try
to contact him

12:02.755 --> 12:05.923
using an ancient ninja
mind probe technique.

12:05.925 --> 12:07.792
Leonardo, my son,

12:07.794 --> 12:10.661
our combined spirits
call out to you.

12:10.663 --> 12:12.496
Let us know
of your whereabouts.

12:12.498 --> 12:14.832
[all roaring]

12:16.601 --> 12:18.068
Dinosaurs?

12:18.070 --> 12:20.037
What a bodacious vision.

12:20.039 --> 12:21.939
But what does
it mean, sensei?

12:21.941 --> 12:23.774
It is hard to say.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.510
It might be an image
of the past,

12:26.512 --> 12:27.611
or present,

12:27.613 --> 12:28.846
or even the future.

12:28.848 --> 12:29.914
Don't you just love

12:29.916 --> 12:31.682
these multiple
choice answers?

12:31.684 --> 12:33.451
<i>[TurtleCom beeping]</i>

12:33.453 --> 12:34.985
Leonardo, is that you?

12:34.987 --> 12:36.286
<i>No, it's me.</i>

12:36.288 --> 12:38.456
<i>But Leonardo</i>
<i>has been spotted</i>

12:38.458 --> 12:41.192
<i>at the downtown</i>
<i>Catalytic Motors showroom.</i>

12:41.194 --> 12:42.960
We'll meet you there.

12:45.330 --> 12:47.898
[Krang]
That energy source
is centered

12:47.900 --> 12:50.067
somewhere
right around here.

12:50.069 --> 12:52.970
In a gravel pit?
That doesn't make sense.

12:52.972 --> 12:55.773
Nevertheless,
I'm getting
energy readings

12:55.775 --> 12:57.074
big time.

12:57.076 --> 13:00.611
Come on, we must
explore this place.

13:02.847 --> 13:04.815
April, this is nuts.

13:04.817 --> 13:05.816
I'm telling you,

13:05.818 --> 13:08.085
eyewitnesses
saw Leonardo.

13:08.087 --> 13:09.987
Well, something
sure happened here.

13:09.989 --> 13:12.689
Oh, no. Not more turtles!

13:14.159 --> 13:15.860
Looks like maybe
he was here.

13:15.862 --> 13:18.028
But why would
he do this?

13:18.030 --> 13:20.731
Maybe our old amigo
has flipped his wig.

13:24.636 --> 13:26.503
[snorting]
I'll take this.

13:26.505 --> 13:27.805
Hey!

13:27.807 --> 13:30.574
As we Ninja Turtles
say...

13:30.576 --> 13:32.877
Cowa-bingo!

13:34.246 --> 13:35.312
Why, you--

13:38.083 --> 13:41.619
<i>And this is</i>
<i>your Skyscraper Square</i>
<i>street sign announcer,</i>

13:41.621 --> 13:44.689
reminding you that
the weatherman calls
for rain tomorrow.

13:44.691 --> 13:47.959
[Bebop]
Man, that is
one big TV.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.327
Let me blast it.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.494
No, wait.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.830
This'll really
get you noticed.

13:54.266 --> 13:56.200
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>don't pollute,</i>

13:56.202 --> 13:58.703
<i>save the whales,</i>
<i>and recycle your garbage.</i>

13:58.705 --> 14:01.605
<i>It's the ecologically correct</i>
<i>thing to do.</i>

14:01.607 --> 14:03.874
<i>Get outta here,</i>
<i>you wimp!</i>

14:03.876 --> 14:06.177
<i>This is Leonardo,</i>
<i>folks.</i>

14:06.179 --> 14:09.580
<i>The boss turtle</i>
<i>of this whole stupid city.</i>

14:09.582 --> 14:12.249
[chuckling]
Oh, boy, is this
ever neat?

14:12.251 --> 14:13.784
<i>[radio static]</i>

14:13.786 --> 14:15.553
April, here.
<i>[Vernon]</i>
<i>April,</i>

14:15.555 --> 14:16.887
<i>that missing</i>
<i>turtle of yours</i>

14:16.889 --> 14:19.623
<i>has been spotted</i>
<i>in more places than Elvis!</i>

14:19.625 --> 14:21.025
Where is he now?

14:21.027 --> 14:23.460
<i>In Skyscraper Square,</i>
<i>and hurry!</i>

14:23.462 --> 14:24.694
<i>You've got</i>
<i>to find that guy</i>

14:24.696 --> 14:27.264
<i>before he wrecks</i>
<i>the entire city!</i>

14:29.000 --> 14:31.201
Krang, this is hopeless.

14:31.203 --> 14:32.869
We've been all over
this quarry,

14:32.871 --> 14:35.273
and there's no sign
of an energy source.

14:35.275 --> 14:36.740
That's what you think.

14:36.742 --> 14:38.409
We're getting closer.

14:38.411 --> 14:41.145
That's why it was
so hard to find!

14:41.147 --> 14:43.114
It's down there.

14:43.116 --> 14:44.681
In that hole?

14:44.683 --> 14:46.117
That's ridiculous.

14:46.119 --> 14:49.120
Just shut up,
and get a rope.

14:51.456 --> 14:53.557
Well, you'd better
be right about this.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.759
There. Didn't I
tell you?

14:58.763 --> 15:01.432
The energy needed
to power this thing

15:01.434 --> 15:03.467
must be immense.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.302
[Shredder]
It's not from outer space.

15:05.304 --> 15:06.803
It must've
drilled its way up

15:06.805 --> 15:08.205
from the center
of the earth.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.475
We found it!
The energy source!

15:11.477 --> 15:14.578
These power cells
are ours now.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.712
<i>[beeping]</i>

15:15.714 --> 15:17.481
Yes, what is it?

15:17.483 --> 15:19.049
<i>Just checking in, boss.</i>

15:19.051 --> 15:21.185
<i>We're really</i>
<i>shaking up this city,</i>

15:21.187 --> 15:22.820
<i>just like you told us.</i>

15:22.822 --> 15:24.055
<i>Watch.</i>

15:24.057 --> 15:26.289
<i>Hey, you, Double Ugly!</i>

<i>Ha, yeah,</i>

15:33.466 --> 15:35.766
Excellent. Keep up
the good work.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.736
<i>Where are you, boss?</i>
<i>In case we need you.</i>

15:38.738 --> 15:41.305
We're at the gravel pit
at the edge of town.

15:41.307 --> 15:43.307
But don't call us,
we'll call you.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.543
Shredder,
can the chit-chat!

15:45.545 --> 15:49.646
We've got a world
to blow off its axis!

15:49.648 --> 15:52.283
All right, Krang,
I'm coming.

15:52.285 --> 15:53.884
Scope it out,
dudes,

15:53.886 --> 15:56.253
Leonardo's
become a TV star,

15:56.255 --> 15:58.689
and it's really
giving him a big head!

15:58.691 --> 16:00.890
<i>My name is Leonardo,</i>

16:00.892 --> 16:04.028
<i>and I'm a real bad dude.</i>

16:04.030 --> 16:06.563
But I notice he has
Bebop's voice.

16:06.565 --> 16:08.398
Come on!

16:08.400 --> 16:12.302
And I got a message
for you other slimy turtles,

16:12.304 --> 16:14.972
which is--
Leonardo!

16:14.974 --> 16:17.207
Why, we've been
looking everywhere
for you.

16:17.209 --> 16:18.709
Uh, hi, guys.
[snorting]

16:18.711 --> 16:20.111
How you doin'?

16:20.113 --> 16:23.514
Hey, pretty bad cold
you got there, Leonardo.

16:23.516 --> 16:26.050
Well, you're about
to get even sicker,

16:26.052 --> 16:27.918
turtle!

16:27.920 --> 16:29.019
Whoa!

16:29.021 --> 16:32.089
Leonardo, what's
gotten into you?

16:34.192 --> 16:36.693
Whoa, you're really Bebop!

16:36.695 --> 16:38.496
Take this, shellbacks!

16:47.538 --> 16:50.240
Okay, what did you do
with Leonardo?

16:50.242 --> 16:52.476
Uh, we didn't
do nothing with him.

16:52.478 --> 16:54.812
The only reason
we knew he was missing

16:54.814 --> 16:56.713
is because
you guys said it.

16:56.715 --> 16:57.848
That's right.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.382
When Leonardo
disappeared,

16:59.384 --> 17:02.052
these two pinheads
were swiping
baseball cards.

17:02.054 --> 17:03.186
Uh-huh,

17:03.188 --> 17:05.288
and Shredder and Krang
didn't take them

17:05.290 --> 17:06.957
because they're too busy
getting ready

17:06.959 --> 17:09.559
to blow the Earth
off its axis.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.228
What?
Yeah.

17:11.230 --> 17:14.098
They found
this real powerful
energy source

17:14.099 --> 17:15.433
in a gravel pit,

17:15.435 --> 17:17.166
And they're gonna
use it to change

17:17.169 --> 17:19.236
the whole world's
climate.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.570
All right, you two.

17:20.573 --> 17:23.373
You're leading us
to that gravel pit.

17:23.375 --> 17:26.343
[Krang]
The Hyper Thruster
is complete!

17:26.345 --> 17:29.613
Now to slam the earth
off its axis.

17:29.615 --> 17:31.247
Oh, blast it.

17:31.249 --> 17:34.184
I'm going to have
to reconfigure
the connectors

17:34.186 --> 17:37.253
to accept these alien
power cells.

17:37.255 --> 17:39.990
But I've been waiting years
to conquer the Earth!

17:39.992 --> 17:43.294
Then a few more hours
won't make a difference.

17:44.462 --> 17:46.730
That's where they found
the energy source,

17:46.732 --> 17:48.765
down there.

17:50.235 --> 17:52.302
You two goons
wait here.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.971
We'll be back
in a moment.

17:56.574 --> 17:57.941
[Raphael]
Huh, now there's
something

17:57.943 --> 17:59.343
you don't see
every day.

17:59.345 --> 18:02.079
[Michelangelo]
Whoa, dinosaurs!

18:02.081 --> 18:04.748
Just like the ones
in Master Splinter's vision.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.883
And they don't look like
a welcoming committee.

18:06.885 --> 18:09.253
[all roaring]

18:12.723 --> 18:14.591
[all roaring]

18:14.593 --> 18:17.728
Man, we dropped right
into Dinosaur Central!

18:17.730 --> 18:20.197
They're the creatures
Splinter saw in his vision.

18:20.199 --> 18:22.432
They must've
eaten Leonardo!

18:22.434 --> 18:23.734
Guess again, guys!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.502
Leonardo!
Leonardo!
Leonardo!

18:25.504 --> 18:27.771
Sorry,
did my friends
scare you?

18:27.773 --> 18:29.639
Did you say friends?

18:29.641 --> 18:31.908
[Michelangelo]
You mean these
jolly green giants

18:31.910 --> 18:33.477
are your compadres?

18:33.479 --> 18:35.879
Oh, yeah. They're
real nice guys.

18:35.881 --> 18:37.547
Allow me
to introduce myself.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.416
My name is Speega.

18:39.418 --> 18:41.084
My friends and I
are the descendants

18:41.086 --> 18:42.552
of a group of dinosaurs

18:42.554 --> 18:45.155
who escaped extinction
millions of years ago,

18:45.157 --> 18:47.290
by taking refuge
in the center of the earth.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.792
And they've been
on a mission to save

18:48.794 --> 18:51.628
endangered species
all over the planet
ever since.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.263
We were on
an urgent mission

18:53.265 --> 18:55.065
to save a rare
species of flower.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.068
But unfortunately,
in our rush,

18:58.070 --> 19:00.004
we damaged
our transport driller.

19:00.006 --> 19:01.405
While you guys
were out,

19:01.407 --> 19:03.840
I picked up
their distress signal
on Donatello's radio.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.309
I found them here.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.311
Yes, and thanks
to Leonardo's help,

19:07.313 --> 19:09.646
we rescued
the endangered flower.

19:09.648 --> 19:13.217
And I found the parts
to repair their vehicle
in a junkyard.

19:13.219 --> 19:14.484
And now,

19:14.486 --> 19:16.153
we're ready to return
to the earth's core.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.023
Um, there's just
one little problem.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.158
You see, the energy cells
from our transport

19:21.160 --> 19:22.593
seem to be missing.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.862
No, no, no, that is
one big problem.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.163
Krang and Shredder
took 'em.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.498
[Donatello]
And they're gonna
use them

19:27.500 --> 19:29.099
to blow the Earth
off its axis

19:29.101 --> 19:30.567
and wreck
the planet's climate.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.469
Well, what are we
waiting for?

19:32.471 --> 19:33.870
We've gotta
stop 'em.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.140
If there's anything
we can do--

19:36.142 --> 19:39.109
You betcha there is.
Come on.

19:42.013 --> 19:43.147
Hey,

19:43.149 --> 19:45.249
what happened to Bebop
and Rocksteady?

19:45.251 --> 19:46.684
[Donatello]
They must have
gotten loose.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.152
[Raphael]
Look, there they go.

19:48.154 --> 19:50.354
They'll lead us right
to Krang and Shredder.

19:50.356 --> 19:51.622
Come on, Leonardo.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.691
We'll fill you in
on the way.

19:53.693 --> 19:57.027
[Krang]
The Hyper Thruster
is ready!

19:57.029 --> 19:58.495
Well, it took you
long enough.

19:58.497 --> 19:59.896
Hurry up
and ignite it.

19:59.898 --> 20:01.064
Quiet!

20:01.066 --> 20:03.867
This is my supreme
moment of triumph.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.269
Let me relish it.

20:06.271 --> 20:07.738
Boss, boss!

20:07.740 --> 20:08.973
The turtles
are coming!

20:08.975 --> 20:10.640
The turtles
are coming!

20:10.642 --> 20:11.574
Ha!

20:11.576 --> 20:13.377
I say ha!

20:13.379 --> 20:15.645
Even if all four
of them showed up,

20:15.647 --> 20:17.881
they couldn't
stop me.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.516
[Shredder]
Uh, how about
four turtles

20:19.518 --> 20:21.017
and three dinosaurs?

20:21.019 --> 20:23.621
Get them.

20:28.826 --> 20:31.195
Oh, hey! What the--

20:31.197 --> 20:34.231
Impersonate me,
will you?

20:34.233 --> 20:37.001
[Raphael]
Errmp, time's up,
Tin Face.

20:38.202 --> 20:39.903
Hey, no fair!

20:39.905 --> 20:42.406
There's too many
of these geekazoids.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.175
[Raphael]
And those dinosaurs aren't
doing a thing to help us.

20:45.177 --> 20:48.078
Well, I'm terribly sorry,
but it's against our creed

20:48.080 --> 20:50.381
to do harm
to any living creature.

20:50.383 --> 20:53.583
Our mission is to help
endangered species.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.651
Listen, Speega,

20:54.653 --> 20:56.753
every species on this planet
will be endangered

20:56.755 --> 20:58.288
if they ignite
that Thruster.

20:58.290 --> 21:01.291
Besides,
these foot soldiers
aren't living.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.161
They're machines
made of steel and plastic.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.996
They are?

21:05.998 --> 21:08.832
[all roaring]

21:10.435 --> 21:11.768
All right!

21:16.240 --> 21:19.609
The energy cells.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.277
[roaring]

21:35.860 --> 21:38.094
Ho, ho, let's see
how that Thruster

21:38.096 --> 21:39.596
handles 2,000 volts

21:39.598 --> 21:41.531
from the public
address system.

21:41.533 --> 21:42.666
Krang,

21:42.668 --> 21:43.600
we're losing!

21:43.602 --> 21:46.970
I must ignite
the Hyper Thruster.

21:47.905 --> 21:51.775
Now, to blow the earth
off its axis!

21:56.447 --> 21:58.415
I don't believe this.

21:58.417 --> 21:59.583
[Shredder]
Believe it.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.785
The turtles
have done it again.

22:01.787 --> 22:04.254
I've had it
with your idiotic
schemes, Krang!

22:04.256 --> 22:06.590
From now on,
I call the shots.

22:06.592 --> 22:08.758
Don't annoy me, Shredder.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.761
I've had a very bad day!

22:16.000 --> 22:17.701
Here are your energy cells.

22:17.703 --> 22:20.771
Fine, now we can take
the endangered flower

22:20.773 --> 22:22.973
to our home in the center
of the earth,

22:22.975 --> 22:24.408
where it will be safe.

22:24.410 --> 22:26.210
Thank you, my friends.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.278
I wish there were
some way to repay you.

22:28.280 --> 22:29.779
Well, there is,
Speega,

22:29.781 --> 22:31.581
by keeping up
the good work.

22:31.583 --> 22:35.351
Yeah, maybe we'll see
you prehistoric dudes
again someday.

22:35.353 --> 22:38.555
Well, thanks to humankind's
disregard for the environment,

22:38.557 --> 22:41.391
I fear we will
be back all too soon.

22:45.296 --> 22:48.197
[Donatello]
Boy, you sure had us
worried, Leonardo.

22:48.199 --> 22:49.433
[Raphael]
Yeah.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.735
we nearly ran our shells off
looking for you.

22:51.737 --> 22:52.903
Sorry, guys,

22:52.905 --> 22:55.505
but the dinosaur''
distress signal
seemed urgent,

22:55.507 --> 22:57.507
and I couldn't wait
for you to get back.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.443
If I may offer a piece
of advice, Leonardo.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.578
In the words
of an ancient proverb,

23:02.580 --> 23:05.949
When taking unexpected
leave of thy fellow ninja,

23:05.951 --> 23:08.819
always leave a note.
