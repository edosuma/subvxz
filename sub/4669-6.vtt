where do they seek refuge?

again, Ian will get her moving

Wait... excuse me for
interrupting, but it seems to me

02:41.533 --> 02:44.031
that the longer we seek out this submarine,

02:44.057 --> 02:45.640
the further it takes us off our mission.

02:45.665 --> 02:47.485
We need to rebuild the labs

02:47.510 --> 02:49.266

stock of cell culture.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.625
Don't be.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.817
I'm sure you've got your stories.

27:03.900 --> 27:06.446
I lost my wife.

27:07.988 --> 27:09.988
And then you found us.

27:10.382 --> 27:13.016
I-in my case, they found me.

27:13.041 --> 27:16.646
I was just out wandering,
no place to call home.

27:16.671 --> 27:20.807
I didn't even know
there was others like us.

27:20.832 --> 27:24.884
How many are there like us?

27:25.051 --> 27:27.268
Sean says there are millions.

27:27.293 --> 27:29.126
Sean?

27:29.151 --> 27:32.485
Have you heard him speak?
You seen the videos?

27:32.510 --> 27:34.176
Oh, you have to.

27:34.201 --> 27:36.902
And, I mean, don't you let that
fancy accent of his fool you.

27:37.114 --> 27:41.349
I mean, he's European and
all, but he's just like us.

27:41.374 --> 27:42.873
I'd like to meet him.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.427
Well, it's your lucky day,

27:53.910 --> 27:57.528
I need to separate the myoinositol.

27:57.588 --> 28:00.039
Milowsky: Are you sure you
have the correct stereoisomer?

28:00.064 --> 28:02.145
I suggest we try a corn base.

28:02.170 --> 28:04.067
Because of the phytic acid?

28:04.102 --> 28:06.496
Myo is geometrically more stable,

28:06.521 --> 28:08.698
but chelation of the phytic acid

28:08.723 --> 28:12.225
could prevent mineral absorption
into the vaccine structure.

28:12.250 --> 28:14.583
Worth a shot.

28:14.833 --> 28:16.022
Bacon?

28:16.524 --> 28:17.874
Uh...

28:17.899 --> 28:19.899
I'm... I'm sorry, ma'am.

28:19.924 --> 28:22.207
I-I'm afraid you lost me.

28:22.232 --> 28:25.685
At what point, exactly, did I lose you?

28:25.710 --> 28:27.843
About two hours ago.

28:28.661 --> 28:31.496
Well, let's start with the flour, shall we?

28:45.382 --> 28:47.549
We're headed north.

28:47.574 --> 28:49.349
I have a visual of the bus convoy.

28:49.374 --> 28:51.321
I believe Charlie Oscar's in the last bus.

28:51.347 --> 28:52.892
Roger, Cobra Team.

28:52.917 --> 28:54.931
Sir, the sub is transmitting.

28:54.956 --> 28:57.123
They're communicating with someone on land.

28:57.148 --> 28:59.002
Still cannot break the encryption, sir,

28:59.027 --> 29:00.810
but I have a good read
on the signal bearing.

29:00.835 --> 29:02.585
How accurate?

29:02.610 --> 29:05.110
The sub appears to be
holding still at radio depth.

29:05.135 --> 29:06.009
They're not moving, sir.

29:06.034 --> 29:07.450
Mason, can you calculate a range?

29:07.475 --> 29:08.808
Yes, sir, this broadcast

29:08.833 --> 29:10.466
has a different point of origin on land.

29:10.491 --> 29:11.407
It's further north.

29:11.432 --> 29:13.538
We're triangulating approximate
location for the sub.

29:13.700 --> 29:15.316
90 nautical miles.

29:16.024 --> 29:19.313
Can't get much closer at quiet
one without tipping our hand.

29:19.595 --> 29:21.145
Nothing on passive sonar?

29:21.170 --> 29:22.420
Nothing, sir.

29:22.445 --> 29:24.273
She's quiet even at 30 knots,

29:24.298 --> 29:25.587
pretty much silent when she's not moving.

29:25.612 --> 29:27.519
Calculate a position on our target.

29:27.544 --> 29:29.173
I hold the sub at this location.

29:29.198 --> 29:33.304
<i>Nathan James</i> is
here, making 5 knots.

29:33.682 --> 29:35.407
We have a vector plot.

29:35.432 --> 29:37.439
At this range, here's our dog box.

29:37.464 --> 29:40.736
T.A.O., hostile sub designate as Goblin 1.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.271
Yeah, yeah. I'm here, I'm here, I'm here.

29:44.296 --> 29:46.130
How is it?

29:46.155 --> 29:47.423
Yeah, no, no, no, no.

29:47.448 --> 29:48.898
Forget about that.

29:48.923 --> 29:50.939
Have you found the American ship?

29:50.964 --> 29:53.052
Not yet, but we're
heading back towards you.

29:53.077 --> 29:54.056
Your brother said...

29:54.081 --> 29:56.915
I don't care what my
brother said, all right?

29:56.940 --> 29:58.767
We are gonna sink those bastards.

29:58.792 --> 30:00.345
Oi, yes, sir.

30:00.370 --> 30:03.878
Now, here's what I want you to do, okay?

30:04.048 --> 30:05.806
X.O., F.I.S. is green.

30:05.831 --> 30:08.465
Hold active sonar until we
have a solid track on the sub.

30:08.490 --> 30:10.407
Does the dog box cover the sub's location?

30:10.432 --> 30:12.515
Plenty big, ma'am... as long
as the sub is in that box,

30:12.540 --> 30:14.240
the ASROC torpedo will find it.

30:14.339 --> 30:16.228
Slattery: Okay, we only
get one shot at this.

30:16.253 --> 30:17.719
Once we go active,

30:17.744 --> 30:19.737
they'll know where we
are, then they fire back.

30:19.762 --> 30:21.974
T.A.O., permission to shine lance searcher.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.034
Shine lance searcher.

30:23.059 --> 30:24.803
Shining Lance searcher.

30:29.640 --> 30:32.607
Sonar, T.A.O., do you
have an active contact?

30:32.632 --> 30:34.539
I don't understand.

30:34.564 --> 30:39.039
All stations, sonar. Sonar
holds no active contact.

30:39.718 --> 30:41.888
- It's not a sub.
- What is it?

30:42.073 --> 30:44.146
The sonar signature shows
nothing in the water.

30:44.171 --> 30:46.677
Whatever is transmitting from
that spot is on the surface.

30:46.702 --> 30:48.641
It could be a radio relay, a buoy.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.287
That would explain why it's not moving.

30:50.312 --> 30:52.012
And that's how the sub is communicating

30:52.037 --> 30:53.053
with their people on land.

30:53.078 --> 30:54.878
Sub's using it to mask its location.

30:54.903 --> 30:57.383
We have a solid radar track
on the floating relay, sir.

30:57.408 --> 30:58.284
Okay.

30:58.463 --> 31:00.383
Very well.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.883
If we can't use it to find them,

31:01.908 --> 31:03.383
we can't decrypt what they're saying,

31:03.408 --> 31:04.584
let's not let 'em talk at all.

31:04.609 --> 31:05.576
Ready an SM-2.

31:05.608 --> 31:09.442
MSS. T.A.O., kill track 5025 with birds.

31:09.467 --> 31:13.553
Mss, aye. Kill track 5025 with bird.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.573
Fire.

31:15.598 --> 31:18.152
Bird is away.

31:23.052 --> 31:24.661
_

31:24.692 --> 31:27.131
Hello, Ned? Are you there, mate?

31:27.156 --> 31:28.355
Ned?

31:28.787 --> 31:30.451
Direct hit, ma'am.

31:30.476 --> 31:32.142
Radio signal's dead, sir.

31:32.902 --> 31:34.935
Hello?

31:35.795 --> 31:37.342
Oi!

31:37.367 --> 31:39.074
Ian!

31:40.161 --> 31:42.528
Is there anybody there?!

31:43.580 --> 31:45.163
Shit!

32:39.006 --> 32:40.673
Uh-oh.

32:40.698 --> 32:44.366
Looks like they're taking
us to the service entrance.

32:44.391 --> 32:46.508
Taylor, Cobra. We're splitting.

32:46.533 --> 32:48.233
Buses are headed to the main building.

32:49.003 --> 32:51.323
Find us a rally point.

32:51.348 --> 32:53.064
Roger.

32:59.011 --> 33:00.797
Here we go.

33:15.876 --> 33:18.577
Hey, master chief, any word?

33:19.656 --> 33:22.607
[Sighs] Three teams on
an undercover mission,

33:22.632 --> 33:24.610
wandering the swamps of central Florida

33:24.635 --> 33:28.053
led by my commanding
officer, alone and unafraid.

33:28.265 --> 33:29.765
Ma'am, I love the Navy,

33:29.790 --> 33:32.424
but I don't know if I'll
ever get used to this.

33:32.451 --> 33:33.983
I just pray they come back safe,

33:34.008 --> 33:35.958
and we get this vendetta behind us.

33:36.906 --> 33:39.274
They'll make it back.

33:39.299 --> 33:40.682
They always do.

33:40.718 --> 33:43.858
Find anything useful in Dr. Hunter's lab?

33:44.165 --> 33:45.814
Actually...

33:45.839 --> 33:48.006
What's that?

33:48.042 --> 33:49.374
[Blows]

33:50.310 --> 33:53.615
Cornstarch from the chief's mess.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.240
It turns out the secret ingredient

33:55.265 --> 33:56.481
that I've been looking for

33:56.506 --> 33:58.128
was being used to make pancakes.

33:58.153 --> 33:59.570
So you found it?

33:59.595 --> 34:01.127
Well, I have the recipe,

34:01.152 --> 34:02.569
and now all I need is to build

34:02.594 --> 34:04.544
a machine to manufacture the micro powder,

34:04.569 --> 34:07.937
so I was hoping that you
might be able to lend me

34:07.962 --> 34:10.889
one or two of your capable machinists?

34:10.914 --> 34:13.543
I think that can be arranged.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.813
Man: Hold up.

34:16.407 --> 34:18.810
Here we go.

34:22.132 --> 34:23.382
Howdy!

34:23.505 --> 34:24.587
Howdy?

34:24.612 --> 34:26.094
What? I'm from Connecticut.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.753
Hmm.

34:28.149 --> 34:30.483
Whereabouts you boys come from?

34:30.507 --> 34:32.454
Pompano Beach, baby.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.646
- Fancy pants!
- [Laughs]

34:34.670 --> 34:36.621
Well, come on. We got shit to do.

34:36.646 --> 34:38.896
Pull up around back.

34:40.474 --> 34:41.975
Pompano Beach?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.514
Nice pull.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.790
Well, I knew a gal

34:44.815 --> 34:46.398
had a houseboat on the intercoastal

34:46.422 --> 34:47.687
back in the late '90s.

34:47.942 --> 34:50.388
It was a hell of a winter.

34:52.797 --> 34:55.016
Man: Welcome to seaport marina, everyone.

34:55.042 --> 34:57.449
We got coffee, baked bread.

34:58.161 --> 35:00.148
Please, come on in.

35:00.268 --> 35:04.049
Got fresh, cool water
inside, plenty to eat.

35:04.074 --> 35:06.259
No sign of Danny or Tex.

35:06.284 --> 35:08.220
Armed guards every 100 yards.

35:08.245 --> 35:10.452
Barbed wire fences, roving sentries.

35:10.477 --> 35:11.653
It's like a fortress.

35:11.678 --> 35:13.153
Or a prison.

35:14.306 --> 35:16.673
Now, I'm sure there are those among you

35:16.698 --> 35:19.616
who say, "why fight?

35:19.967 --> 35:21.934
Why judge those who are not blessed

35:21.959 --> 35:23.748
with our purity of blood?"

35:23.773 --> 35:26.107
Well, I assure you, brothers and sisters,

35:26.610 --> 35:29.060
that we are not the ones
who brought this fight.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.273
- Woman: Yeah!
- Man: Right.

35:30.298 --> 35:31.255
[Applause]

35:31.280 --> 35:33.099
Our bodies are immune to the virus,

35:33.124 --> 35:34.333
but not to bigotry!

35:34.358 --> 35:36.108
[Cheers and applause]

35:36.133 --> 35:38.264
Not to hatred!

35:38.289 --> 35:40.206
You've all heard stories

35:40.231 --> 35:41.764
of immunes dragged from their homes...

35:41.789 --> 35:43.064
That voice.

35:43.209 --> 35:45.075
By their own neighbors.

35:45.100 --> 35:46.550
I recognize it.

35:46.575 --> 35:48.241
We have the responsibility
to protect ourselves...

35:48.266 --> 35:50.100
Video from Dr. Hunter's lab.

35:50.125 --> 35:52.364
To band together!

35:52.389 --> 35:54.764
These are the guys.

35:55.533 --> 35:58.663
For it is a fight, us against them!

35:58.688 --> 36:00.278
[Cheers and applause]

36:00.303 --> 36:04.722
Got themselves a cult...
With an army behind them.

36:04.747 --> 36:07.909
To fight for our immunity and
what we're trying to build here.

36:07.934 --> 36:09.903
- Can you do that for me?
- [Cheers and applause]

36:10.336 --> 36:11.585
Can you do that?

36:11.610 --> 36:14.527
Can you be a warrior for the cause?

36:14.552 --> 36:16.731
Cobra Team, what is your whiskey?

36:16.756 --> 36:18.099
This is Cobra Team.

36:18.124 --> 36:19.802
Tiger Team is out of sight

36:19.827 --> 36:21.509
behind the building complex.

36:21.534 --> 36:23.908
Radio silent for 30 minutes.

36:23.974 --> 36:27.025
Vulture Team is in the complex.

36:27.294 --> 36:29.482
Gonna try to pass word to Tiger Team.

36:29.507 --> 36:31.557
But Vulture has no comms. Over.

36:31.582 --> 36:33.704
Roger that. Make contact with Tiger Team.

36:33.729 --> 36:36.177
- Get me an exfil plan now.
- Roger.

36:36.202 --> 36:38.119
I'm looking for a rally point.

36:38.144 --> 36:40.478
We'll radio coordinates. Over.

36:40.503 --> 36:42.303
Any contact on the sonar?

36:42.328 --> 36:44.068
No, sir, but it won't take them long

36:44.093 --> 36:46.427
to figure out who blew up that radio relay.

36:56.113 --> 36:59.241
Friends, fellow immunes,

36:59.266 --> 37:02.429
my heart fills with
joy to see you all here.

37:02.454 --> 37:04.061
What a crowd!

37:04.929 --> 37:07.513
Woman: We love you, Sean!

37:07.538 --> 37:09.254
We love you, man!

37:09.279 --> 37:10.731
And I love you, too.

37:10.756 --> 37:13.544
Yes, I-I truly... I love all of you.

37:13.568 --> 37:16.374
And what a crowd.

37:16.594 --> 37:21.668
And more of you, more of
us arriving every hour.

37:21.693 --> 37:24.533
We expect a thousand by week's end.

37:24.558 --> 37:27.309
That's right. We're gonna
need a bigger ballroom.

37:27.334 --> 37:28.917
[Cheers and applause]

37:34.166 --> 37:36.554
With the 700 in St. Augustine,

37:36.579 --> 37:38.295
the 1,200 in Gainesville,

37:38.320 --> 37:40.830
and the nearly 6,000...

37:40.855 --> 37:45.453
That's right, 6,000... Across
the state in Clearwater,

37:45.479 --> 37:47.262
our ranks are growing,

37:47.287 --> 37:52.624
and we are spreading our
message across this great nation!

37:52.649 --> 37:56.568
And it all starts here with all of you...

37:56.593 --> 37:58.927
My beloved immunes.

37:58.952 --> 38:02.787
[Cheers and applause]

38:03.218 --> 38:05.718
Niels: At the safe zone in the mall,

38:05.841 --> 38:09.793
I found 320 immune to my disease.

38:09.986 --> 38:13.821
- That's bloody good, yeah?
- There are still...

38:13.857 --> 38:15.859
Many challenges before us...

38:15.884 --> 38:16.883
Creepy git.

38:16.908 --> 38:17.969
[Laughs]

38:17.994 --> 38:19.527
My brothers and sisters.

38:19.552 --> 38:23.367
There aren't many who have
not yet heard our message.

38:23.603 --> 38:26.687
That will change, my friends, because soon,

38:26.712 --> 38:31.414
we are going to New Orleans
to join other immunes

38:31.439 --> 38:34.781
so we can get our story
spread out across the country.

38:34.873 --> 38:40.109
But despite our many,
many successes so far,

38:40.134 --> 38:45.504
I still can't help feel
that I have failed you.

38:45.529 --> 38:50.253
- [Indistinct shouting]
- I come here as your humble messenger,

38:50.278 --> 38:52.862
spreading the gospel of the immunes.

38:52.887 --> 38:56.218
But if America is to rise again,

38:56.551 --> 38:59.711
it needs a true leader.

38:59.736 --> 39:01.859
- Sean, we have you!
- Lead us, Sean!

39:01.884 --> 39:03.664
No, no, no, no, not... not me. Not me.

39:03.689 --> 39:05.789
I... I come from a different land.

39:05.814 --> 39:09.016
American immunes need an American leader,

39:09.041 --> 39:13.399
someone who has our blood,
but your American spirit.

39:13.423 --> 39:15.028
Let's have a look at this.

39:18.826 --> 39:20.909
Reporter: <i> With Florida</i>
<i>reporting the first cases</i>

39:20.934 --> 39:23.129

39:28.329 --> 39:30.403

39:30.428 --> 39:32.294
Michener: <i> The information</i>
<i>we have right now,</i>

39:32.319 --> 39:33.979
<i>we seem to have contained the virus.</i>

39:34.004 --> 39:35.720
Reporter: <i>How did
the virus get here?</i>

39:35.745 --> 39:37.078
<i>As I said, we don't know</i>

39:37.103 --> 39:38.936

39:38.961 --> 39:40.710

39:46.444 --> 39:49.445
[Applause]

39:49.507 --> 39:54.427
Sean: Secretary Michener
shares our special gift.

39:54.452 --> 39:57.316
It's the reason he's alive
and here with us today

39:57.341 --> 39:59.317
while the rest of the U.S. government

39:59.342 --> 40:01.718
perished from this earth.

40:01.743 --> 40:05.295
Now, I have some news for you.

40:05.635 --> 40:09.218
According to the U.S. constitution,

40:09.243 --> 40:12.517
as secretary of housing
and urban development,

40:12.542 --> 40:16.043
Jeffrey Michener is number 12

40:16.068 --> 40:18.817
in the order of presidential succession.

40:18.842 --> 40:20.618
With the others all gone,

40:20.958 --> 40:26.317
well, Jeffrey Michener is your president.

40:26.342 --> 40:29.317
[Cheers and applause]

40:30.337 --> 40:34.118
You heard me right, and
when we get to New Orleans,

40:34.143 --> 40:36.817
we will install him in his rightful office,

40:36.842 --> 40:40.560
where he can create a cabinet,
take control of the military,

40:40.585 --> 40:45.255
and show the world that America is back!

40:45.280 --> 40:49.232
America has a new president!

40:49.257 --> 40:52.792
And he is one of us!

40:52.817 --> 40:55.718
[Cheers and applause]

40:59.432 --> 41:01.131
Sean, what the hell are you talking about?

41:01.156 --> 41:02.689
You didn't say anything about this.

41:02.846 --> 41:07.718
I told you, brother. I have a plan.

41:23.873 --> 41:26.540
[Cheers and applause]
