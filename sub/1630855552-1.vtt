Aho!

00:33.868 --> 00:35.705
Young and old warriors!

You little ones out there,

00:39.813 --> 00:42.184
you tall ones, you short ones,

you full-blood ones,
you disenrolled ones,

00:44.623 --> 00:46.326
you pretend ones,

00:46.326 --> 00:48.196
the ones that were never
enrolled in the first place

00:48.196 --> 00:50.234
but you can still prove
your descendancy,

00:50.234 --> 00:51.504
good to see you.

00:53.240 --> 00:56.312
Welcome to the spirit world.

00:59.553 --> 01:02.124
As you may know...

01:02.124 --> 01:05.431
my name...
William Knifeman.

01:08.638 --> 01:13.480
I'm here to continue the story,
a story as old as time.

01:13.480 --> 01:15.819
A story as fresh
as mountain dew.

01:15.819 --> 01:19.425
A story that happened yesterday.

01:19.425 --> 01:21.764
Or maybe it happened last week.

01:21.764 --> 01:24.536
Or maybe it has yet
to even happen.

01:24.536 --> 01:26.405
Oh, fuck.

01:28.376 --> 01:30.682
So, let's get to it.

01:34.689 --> 01:37.361
Go, you little shit. Come on.

01:37.361 --> 01:40.502
People are watching.

01:40.502 --> 01:43.440
<i>Last time we saw
those little Rez Dog shits,</i>

01:43.440 --> 01:45.144
<i>they were all happy.</i>

01:45.144 --> 01:46.914
<i>Just frolicking in the ocean.</i>

01:46.914 --> 01:50.187
<i>It made me cry little spirit
tears to see them like that.</i>

01:50.187 --> 01:52.659
- Love you, bitch.
<i>- Their car was stolen.</i>

01:52.659 --> 01:54.462
- That was literally all...
<i>- They had no money.</i>

01:54.462 --> 01:56.867
- We're not going back.
<i>- And the young brave warrior</i>

01:56.867 --> 01:59.773
<i>named Bear decided
he wasn't going to go home.</i>

01:59.773 --> 02:02.178
And why should you care? I mean,

02:02.178 --> 02:03.815
it's not like some of
your ancestors stole this land

02:03.815 --> 02:05.819
and then forced us
to live on reservations, right?

02:05.819 --> 02:08.323
And so, the story continues.

02:08.323 --> 02:10.929
Are we watching
our little Baby Bear Cub

02:10.929 --> 02:12.799
<i>become a man before our eyes?</i>

02:12.799 --> 02:15.170
<i>Did he go see his dad? He did.</i>

02:15.170 --> 02:16.874
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:16.874 --> 02:20.548
Sure you didn't just dial
the wrong number?

02:20.548 --> 02:23.721
I told you, I called the number
I had saved on my phone.

02:23.721 --> 02:26.894
He just... must have changed it
or something.

02:26.894 --> 02:29.733
Fuck, if he doesn't answer,
let's go find White Jesus, bro.

02:31.302 --> 02:32.672
He's gonna answer.

02:34.643 --> 02:37.949
Hold the fuck on, goddamn.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.318
Fuck?

02:39.318 --> 02:41.489
Hey, I said be careful.

02:41.489 --> 02:42.692
What?

02:42.692 --> 02:44.929
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.238
Um, I'm-I'm looking for Punkin.

02:49.238 --> 02:50.508
- Punkin?
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.508 --> 02:52.378
Haven't seen him
in about a week.

02:52.378 --> 02:54.482
Took off with his so-called
manager on tour up in Oakland.

02:54.482 --> 02:57.689
Piece of shit
hasn't called once.

02:57.689 --> 02:59.425
Why?

03:01.295 --> 03:03.835
Um, no reason.
I was just looking for him.

03:03.835 --> 03:06.607
He said that I can c--
I-I c-can come by

03:06.607 --> 03:07.976
and record a song.

03:07.976 --> 03:09.580
So, yeah, um...

03:09.580 --> 03:12.017
But if he's not here,
it's-it's all good.

03:12.017 --> 03:13.386
Thanks.

03:13.386 --> 03:15.323
Sorry about that. Yeah.

03:19.465 --> 03:20.969
<i>Eh, it was kind of uneventful.</i>

03:20.969 --> 03:22.572
<i>But more on that later.</i>

03:22.572 --> 03:24.510
<i>I bet you're wondering
what happened</i>

03:24.510 --> 03:26.514
<i>after that fateful moment,</i>

03:26.514 --> 03:28.718
'cause like any beautiful,

03:28.718 --> 03:32.659
long-haired, wonderful-looking
Indigenous storyteller,

03:32.659 --> 03:35.297
I'm gonna drop you right
in the middle of the action.

03:35.297 --> 03:37.769
Aho!

03:42.679 --> 03:44.817
Listen, I don't do too well
in the back of cars.

03:44.817 --> 03:47.021
- I get carsick.
- Hey,
you about to be sick?

03:47.021 --> 03:48.957
Hey, for real, don't puke
in my car. I got a date later.

03:50.327 --> 03:51.597
You're riding the brake.

03:51.597 --> 03:53.033
- Stop doing that.
- You ever driven in L.A.?

03:53.033 --> 03:55.370
If you don't ride the brake,
you might die.

03:55.370 --> 03:57.809
Oh, my God.

03:57.809 --> 03:59.813
Hey, do I need to pull over?

03:59.813 --> 04:01.449
No, just drive.

04:04.990 --> 04:07.328
- Can you turn that down?
- You don't like my music?

04:07.328 --> 04:09.566
I have an audition later, it
helps gets me in the headspace.

04:09.566 --> 04:10.835
I have a phone call.

04:10.835 --> 04:12.471
Got it.

04:12.471 --> 04:14.041
- Did you get them yet?
- Uh, no, almost there.

04:14.041 --> 04:16.446
You tell Bear he is grounded
for a year.

04:16.446 --> 04:18.016
- I will.
- He can do whatever he wants

04:18.016 --> 04:19.753
when he gets out of my house,
but until then,

04:19.753 --> 04:21.624
he will obey my rules.

04:21.624 --> 04:24.630
All right, Rita, I got to go.
I'm getting carsick.

04:24.630 --> 04:27.536
Brethren, sistren,

04:27.536 --> 04:29.071
do not fret.

04:29.071 --> 04:31.911
You'll always have a home
in my manger.

04:31.911 --> 04:34.516
Surprisingly,
it was comfortable.

04:34.516 --> 04:35.985
Ah, it's anointed, my son.

04:35.985 --> 04:38.925
Man, I can't spend
another night in a manger.

04:38.925 --> 04:40.795
- Aww.
- For real.

04:44.903 --> 04:46.707
Ew.

04:46.707 --> 04:47.876
Oh, they must've drugged her.

04:47.876 --> 04:49.345
Auntie.

04:49.345 --> 04:50.915
Fuck, they got her, man.

04:50.915 --> 04:52.451
Ride the wave.

04:52.451 --> 04:53.754
Auntie, you okay?

04:53.754 --> 04:55.023
See, kids,

04:55.023 --> 04:57.027
this is why we don't do drugs.

04:58.096 --> 04:59.900
You never know what's in them.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.639
I'm not on drugs.
His driving made me sick.

05:02.639 --> 05:04.475
Ah, L.A. drivers. Mm.

05:04.475 --> 05:06.479
Who are you?

05:06.479 --> 05:09.085
- Who is this?
- Our friend.

05:09.085 --> 05:11.422
- White Jesus.
- A street person.

05:11.422 --> 05:12.792
At thou service.

05:14.028 --> 05:15.497
At <i>thou</i> service.

05:15.497 --> 05:16.800
- You kids okay?
- At <i>thou</i> service.

05:16.800 --> 05:17.669
What the hell
are you doing in L.A.?

05:17.669 --> 05:18.905
We just came to...

05:18.905 --> 05:20.140
We came to say goodbye
to Daniel.

05:20.140 --> 05:21.710
It was his wish was to come

05:21.710 --> 05:23.781
- to California.
- Then we got jacked.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.486
So you just leave
without telling anyone?

05:26.486 --> 05:27.989
I told my grandma.

05:27.989 --> 05:29.660
I'm excited to go home.

05:29.660 --> 05:31.062
I've never flown before.

05:31.062 --> 05:33.601
Yeah, we flying in the sky.

05:33.601 --> 05:35.404
I'm-a order all the peanuts
and all the pretzels.

05:35.404 --> 05:37.509
Gonna stash some,
take some home.

05:37.509 --> 05:38.945
- Peanuts?
- Mm-hmm.

05:38.945 --> 05:41.049
Airplane?
Fuck, we're not flying.

05:41.049 --> 05:42.852
You know how much that'll be
for all those tickets?

05:42.852 --> 05:44.856
Well, what, then,
we renting a car?

05:44.856 --> 05:46.794
No. Bus.

05:46.794 --> 05:48.163
Yes.

05:48.163 --> 05:49.900
The best way to travel.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.572
You really get to see
so-called America like that.

05:52.572 --> 05:54.710
Why are you here?

05:54.710 --> 05:57.081
I am merely a guide
for the young ones.

05:57.081 --> 05:58.784
Guiding them to safety.

05:58.784 --> 06:01.724
Speaking of which,
can I have a couple of bucks?

06:01.724 --> 06:02.993
Let's go.

06:02.993 --> 06:04.462
White Jesus, man,

06:04.462 --> 06:06.634
don't make me cry.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.836
- Cry not.
- I hate goodbyes.

06:07.836 --> 06:10.742
Fear not, young one.

06:10.742 --> 06:12.846
Ah, Beartholemu,

06:12.846 --> 06:14.516
remember to lead
with your heart.

06:14.516 --> 06:16.419
Elora Danan.

06:16.419 --> 06:18.624
Drink it in. Yes.

06:18.624 --> 06:20.093
You'll be an adult soon.

06:20.093 --> 06:22.498
Here you go. Here.

06:22.498 --> 06:23.834
Blessings.

06:23.834 --> 06:25.738
Thanks for watching out
for them.

06:25.738 --> 06:27.676
I will eat two hot dogs
in your honor today.

06:27.676 --> 06:29.946
And in honor of your journey.

06:29.946 --> 06:31.817
- Thank you, White Jesus.
- Bye, White Jesus.

06:31.817 --> 06:33.654
- Later.
- Travel well.
- Get me to a shower.

06:33.654 --> 06:34.890
- He was nice.
- Yeah, he was a nice guy.

06:34.890 --> 06:36.092
- Ugh. Take us home.
- It's cool.

06:36.092 --> 06:36.860
We should write
a book about him.

06:44.676 --> 06:47.448
Ooh. Hookah.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.020
Oh. Oh, hey, there.

06:50.020 --> 06:51.957
Hey, I know, I know, I know,
I threw a lot at you

06:51.957 --> 06:53.493
in that first
three minutes, right?

06:53.493 --> 06:55.732
Yeah. But you have to trust me.

06:55.732 --> 06:58.604
I'm an Indigenous storyteller,
to the bone.

06:58.604 --> 07:01.242
I'm like a, I'm like
a Greek chorus,

07:01.242 --> 07:04.181
but with a loincloth. Yeah.

07:04.181 --> 07:06.119
But back to our young ones.

07:06.119 --> 07:09.258
The little rez rats.
Where are they now?

07:09.258 --> 07:13.166
Taking that long journey home,
that long road east.

07:13.166 --> 07:17.575
In that sacred way, leaving
behind some of their pains.

07:17.575 --> 07:20.147
But maybe carrying
some difficulties with them

07:20.147 --> 07:21.617

09:50.815 --> 09:52.284
Do you want anything, Bear?

09:52.284 --> 09:53.921
Just get me, like,
a granola bar or something.

09:53.921 --> 09:55.992
Cheap. Let's go, bro.

09:55.992 --> 09:58.797
Time to hunt for the village.

09:58.797 --> 10:02.003

we're just gatherers.

10:03.339 --> 10:04.976
Excuse me. Uh, um,

10:04.976 --> 10:07.114
y'all want some free donuts?

10:09.753 --> 10:12.691

10:14.729 --> 10:16.199
Yeah, no, thank you.

10:16.199 --> 10:17.968
Totally free.

10:19.104 --> 10:21.341
Cool, cool, cool. No worries.

10:27.822 --> 10:30.327
I, for real, almost took one.

10:30.327 --> 10:32.163
Stupid.

10:33.332 --> 10:34.702
You good?

10:35.738 --> 10:38.677
Yeah. Just tired.

10:40.446 --> 10:43.119

so sad panties, then?

10:43.119 --> 10:46.192
- Your dad?
- No.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.271
I don't know, man.

10:52.271 --> 10:54.008

10:54.008 --> 10:56.178
You know? And...

10:56.178 --> 10:58.851
it felt good,
it felt right, but...

10:58.851 --> 11:01.122
but what now?

11:01.122 --> 11:04.795
I mean, Daniel's still not here.

11:08.904 --> 11:11.876
I think we're meant to live
how he would've wanted to live.

11:14.114 --> 11:15.684
Yeah.

11:18.222 --> 11:21.329
Hey. Yeah, I-I know.

11:21.329 --> 11:23.901
Yeah, I told you
I was sick. I...

11:23.901 --> 11:26.974
It's pretty bad.

11:26.974 --> 11:28.276
We got the goods.

11:28.276 --> 11:31.248
<i>- Mvto.</i>
- Ooh. Oh. Thank you.

11:31.248 --> 11:33.152
- I'm gonna go hit the O.
- All right.

11:36.191 --> 11:37.929
Yes.

11:37.929 --> 11:39.431
Cheese.

11:39.431 --> 11:41.335
- What?
- It was free.

11:43.239 --> 11:45.176
Carry on.

12:02.043 --> 12:04.849
Oh. Fuck.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.218
<i>Attention.</i>

12:06.218 --> 12:10.093
<i>Bus 1491 to Tulsa</i>

12:10.093 --> 12:12.197
<i>is departing in 15 minutes.</i>

12:12.197 --> 12:14.034
I'll find Teenie.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.072
- All right.
- Thank you.

12:16.072 --> 12:18.076
Where's mine? Fuck.

12:18.076 --> 12:19.477
Sorry.

12:21.516 --> 12:23.753
- Here.
<i>- Mvto.</i>

12:28.462 --> 12:30.032
Everything good?

12:31.068 --> 12:32.471
Yeah.

12:32.471 --> 12:34.475
Just, uh...

12:34.475 --> 12:36.580
probably lost my job.

12:36.580 --> 12:39.018
Shit. For real?

12:39.018 --> 12:40.252
Yeah.

12:49.271 --> 12:51.943
Sorry.

12:51.943 --> 12:54.048
It's okay.

12:54.048 --> 12:56.987
Just feel like it was time
to move on.

12:56.987 --> 12:59.391
It is the longest
I've had one job for, though.

12:59.391 --> 13:01.328
Almost eight years.

13:03.499 --> 13:05.003
What do you do?

13:05.003 --> 13:06.338
I work at a company
out of Phoenix

13:06.338 --> 13:08.142
that makes all those pamphlets

13:08.142 --> 13:11.282
all over the IHS, you know,
"Diabetes is not our way,"

13:11.282 --> 13:16.324
or "Keep the circle sacred,
get tested for syphilis."

13:18.129 --> 13:20.601
- Hmm.
- Oh, it's not that bad.

13:20.601 --> 13:23.105
I like my life in Phoenix.

13:24.609 --> 13:26.512
I do miss home, though.

13:41.108 --> 13:44.047
- Aho! <i>Hoka. Hoka.</i>
- Ugh...

13:44.047 --> 13:46.419
Gosh, man, can you close that?

13:46.419 --> 13:47.922
Huh?

13:47.922 --> 13:49.358
Oh, sorry.

13:49.358 --> 13:50.961
I can't. Spirit fingers.

13:50.961 --> 13:52.364
Yeah, they go
right through the door.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.435
Hey, did you know,
back in the day,

13:54.435 --> 13:56.573
we used to hold it
for each other when we peed?

13:56.573 --> 13:58.309
What? Oh-- What?

13:58.309 --> 14:00.847
Hey, you shouldn't
get on that bus.

14:02.150 --> 14:04.054
Why? Wait--

14:04.054 --> 14:06.292
What do you mean? Like,
something bad's gonna happen?

14:06.292 --> 14:08.530
Oh, no. No, no, no.
Nothing like that.

14:08.530 --> 14:11.035
What I mean is that <i>you</i>
shouldn't get on that bus.

14:11.035 --> 14:12.437
Yeah.

14:12.437 --> 14:15.243
Your path leads elsewhere,
young buck.

14:15.243 --> 14:17.247
What are you talking about, man?

14:17.247 --> 14:21.122
Uh, fuck that. I-I don't even
know why you're here, bro.

14:21.122 --> 14:22.390
I did everything you asked.

14:22.390 --> 14:25.296
I-I got a job,
I went to the ocean.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.904
Isn't that enough? Like...

14:28.904 --> 14:30.306
Ugh.

14:31.943 --> 14:35.383
It's, uh, it's, uh, um,

14:35.383 --> 14:37.287
- it's, uh, it-it's a play.
- Hmm.

14:37.287 --> 14:39.291
Yeah. I'm just, I'm just, uh,
studying lines for a play.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.297
Fuck, uh, fuck, uh, Shakespeare.

14:42.297 --> 14:44.636
- Ah. All the world's
a stage, huh?
- Right.

14:44.636 --> 14:46.038
I'm gonna go back
to the audience now.

14:46.038 --> 14:47.240
Have at it, Brando.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.146
Yeah.

14:50.146 --> 14:53.452
Look at that.
Got me looking crazy.

14:53.452 --> 14:56.058
I'll tell you a secret, Elora.

14:56.058 --> 14:58.162
Adults are fucked up.

14:58.162 --> 15:00.734
More fucked up
than you youngins.

15:00.734 --> 15:03.406
Doubt it.

15:03.406 --> 15:05.276
Well, think about yourself
when you were 11.

15:05.276 --> 15:08.382
What were you doing?

15:10.588 --> 15:15.664
I was running around
with Bear and Daniel,

15:15.664 --> 15:17.635
kicking their ass at football.

15:17.635 --> 15:19.304
Getting in trouble by Grandma.

15:21.275 --> 15:24.648
But, like, how did you feel?
You remember your thoughts?

15:26.619 --> 15:29.358
Felt kind of the same
as it does now?

15:29.358 --> 15:32.030
Exactly. It's the same.

15:32.030 --> 15:35.604
I feel the same as I did
when I was your age.

15:35.604 --> 15:37.575
There's no miraculous change.

15:37.575 --> 15:40.981
You're the same person you were
when you first opened your eyes.

15:40.981 --> 15:44.154
Except, when you're an adult,
you have baggage,

15:44.154 --> 15:47.327
and the baggage gets heavier.

15:47.327 --> 15:48.730
And that's what changes people.

15:50.433 --> 15:52.505
So you got to deal
with your shit,

15:52.505 --> 15:54.575
get rid of it
or you just keep carrying it.

15:56.746 --> 15:59.484
And some kids have more baggage
than others.

16:01.455 --> 16:04.596
We can't imagine what it's like.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.333
Daniel, your mom.

16:08.369 --> 16:10.540
You never know
what they were carrying.

16:12.343 --> 16:14.782
Oi. The bus is about to leave.

16:14.782 --> 16:16.252
Oh, shit.

16:19.659 --> 16:22.330
Wait, where...
where's Bear and Cheese?

16:24.735 --> 16:26.471
Oh, fuck.

16:29.244 --> 16:31.248
Oh, they're right there.

16:31.248 --> 16:34.054
His mom would kill me.

16:34.054 --> 16:36.626
- You got your tickets?
- Yeah.

16:36.626 --> 16:38.563
- I think.
- Yeah.

16:39.598 --> 16:40.667
Okay.

16:46.244 --> 16:48.584
Look, I kn

16:48.584 --> 16:50.253
It's fucked up, right?

16:50.253 --> 16:53.459
Two valuable,
sacred spiritual lessons

16:53.459 --> 16:55.330
to learn in this right now.

16:55.330 --> 16:58.336
One is always use a buddy system
when you're traveling the world.

16:58.336 --> 17:01.208
It really protects our relatives
in a good, sacred way.

17:01.208 --> 17:03.446
And two...

17:03.446 --> 17:05.316
Fuck, I forgot whatever two was.

17:05.316 --> 17:07.822
Well, anyways, let's get back
to the story, okay?

17:07.822 --> 17:11.128
They're on the bus now,
going that way.

17:11.128 --> 17:14.133
And our young warrior Bear, well...

17:14.935 --> 17:17.575
...you'll see the journey
he's on.

17:17.575 --> 17:18.810
<i>Hoka.</i>

17:21.683 --> 17:23.820
Oh, no.

17:23.820 --> 17:27.360
No. Come on, man.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.163
Oh. Uh...

17:31.903 --> 17:33.840
Fuck!

17:33.840 --> 17:36.211
Fuck, man.

17:36.211 --> 17:37.748
- Now, let me get this straight.
- Okay. Yep.

17:37.748 --> 17:39.519
You were busy practicing a play
in the bathroom...

17:39.519 --> 17:40.821
- Mm-hmm.
- ...you missed your bus...

17:40.821 --> 17:42.558
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and now you want me

17:42.558 --> 17:44.428
to ask them to turn
the bus around?

17:44.428 --> 17:46.866
- Exactly. Yes.
- Hey. It's true.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.537
- I heard him.
- Mm, okay.

17:48.537 --> 17:49.872
Well, that's not gonna happen.

17:49.872 --> 17:50.874
You would have to purchase
a new ticket

17:50.874 --> 17:52.310
for the next bus, which...

17:52.310 --> 17:53.814
leaves tomorrow.

17:53.814 --> 17:56.586
Fuck. I-I don't have
any money, though.

17:56.586 --> 17:58.757
- Is that, like, we could...
- Next.

17:58.757 --> 18:01.763
Really? Like, are we... Man.

18:01.763 --> 18:02.864
Fuck.

18:08.777 --> 18:10.313
Fuck.

18:18.830 --> 18:20.667
Fuck, man.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.684
You know dachshunds
aren't indigenous

18:28.684 --> 18:30.921
to the Americas?

18:30.921 --> 18:32.457
I said, "He would know."

18:32.457 --> 18:34.629
Fuck off, man,
you made me miss my bus.

18:34.629 --> 18:38.704
Ah, you know, when I was young,
my mom, she told me,

18:38.704 --> 18:40.941
"Take your time.

18:40.941 --> 18:42.845
Don't live too fast."

18:42.845 --> 18:44.549
I ain't got time
for your stories right now.

18:44.549 --> 18:47.287
Remember, there's a Creator
always up above.

18:50.861 --> 18:54.234
You have a greater purpose, Bear.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.606
Now, I know I told you
you got to handle your shit,

18:56.606 --> 18:58.577
and you've been doing a really
good job, Nephew/Grandson.

18:58.577 --> 19:01.348
But this time between us?
It ain't over.

19:01.348 --> 19:04.855
What you did at your dad's,
that was a big step for you.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.762
The path to healing for a man

19:07.762 --> 19:09.798
is often found in the
opportunities to help others.

19:11.435 --> 19:12.905
And here's your chance
to take such a journey there,

19:12.905 --> 19:14.542
Grandson/Nephew.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.980
Oh, man, I-I don't have
nowhere to go, dude.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.683
- Uh...
- Exactly.

19:18.683 --> 19:20.921
You have nowhere to go
but somewhere.

19:20.921 --> 19:22.591
Oh, gosh, man.

19:22.591 --> 19:25.396
Knowledge bomb drop.
<i>Hoka, hoka, ha.</i>

19:27.333 --> 19:29.505
Uh, anyways, I think you should
start walking that way.

19:30.674 --> 19:31.709
Yeah.

19:33.947 --> 19:35.551
Go on.

19:35.551 --> 19:38.590
That way.

19:38.590 --> 19:41.462
Boy, don't you worry,
you'll find yourself.

19:43.432 --> 19:45.737
Follow your heart
and nothing else.

19:45.737 --> 19:46.906
Fuck off.

20:11.956 --> 20:13.559
You want some?

20:14.895 --> 20:17.734
Uh, thanks.

20:18.736 --> 20:20.273
These aren't, like, laced

20:20.273 --> 20:21.675
with marijuana oil
or anything, are they?

20:23.913 --> 20:25.984
Nah, little man.
These are straight.

20:25.984 --> 20:28.422
Cool.

20:28.422 --> 20:29.658
Thanks.

20:30.694 --> 20:33.900
Hey, uh, you Native?

20:36.906 --> 20:39.579
Hell yeah!

20:39.579 --> 20:42.918
Man, I'm Comanche and Ponca.

20:42.918 --> 20:44.655
Weebelhai, whoop, whoop.

20:44.655 --> 20:48.028
Nomono, whoop, whoop.

20:48.028 --> 20:49.064
These your homies?

20:49.064 --> 20:50.667
Yeah.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.370
More like relatives.

20:52.370 --> 20:54.542
Is that them in the pictures
you're drawing?

20:54.542 --> 20:57.480
Yeah. There's my grandma.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.585
- And there's me on horseback.
- Uh-huh.

20:59.585 --> 21:01.789
Although I've never
ridden a horse before.

21:01.789 --> 21:04.929
And this is trebuchet.

21:04.929 --> 21:08.068
One time I got robbed
at gunpoint,

21:08.068 --> 21:09.739
and I called the police.

21:09.739 --> 21:11.576
Didn't matter.

21:11.576 --> 21:13.947
They came down and they
arrested me for some shit I did,

21:13.947 --> 21:17.320
like, ten years ago
I totally forgot about.

21:17.320 --> 21:19.357
I...

21:19.357 --> 21:22.698
I-I'm not sure
how that's connected, but...

21:22.698 --> 21:25.469
It's all connected.

21:27.841 --> 21:29.578
Whoop, whoop.

21:53.960 --> 21:58.469
Hey, you can crash at my place
if you want to.

21:58.469 --> 22:00.707
There's lots of room.

22:00.707 --> 22:03.513
Okay. I mean, I-I...

22:03.513 --> 22:07.453
I might have to head right back,
but we'll see.

22:10.492 --> 22:12.463
You know you look just like her.

22:12.463 --> 22:15.436
Yeah, I heard.

22:15.436 --> 22:17.808
But sometimes you do
those facial gestures,

22:17.808 --> 22:19.711
just reminds me of your dad.

22:22.116 --> 22:23.686
My dad?

22:24.688 --> 22:26.491
Yes, your dad.

22:26.491 --> 22:28.930
What, you thought you grew
inside your mom like baby Jesus?

22:28.930 --> 22:32.437
Obviously, I know
I have a dad, but...

22:32.437 --> 22:35.009
I thought maybe he was the one
driving the bike.

22:37.080 --> 22:39.451
I swear, that's why I love
being gone from Okern,

22:39.451 --> 22:41.488
no one talks about shit.

22:41.488 --> 22:44.160
How do you go your whole life
and not ask about your dad?

22:44.160 --> 22:47.901
I did, but my Grandma Mabel
wouldn't say shit.

22:47.901 --> 22:49.839
She said she wouldn't
speak about the dead.

22:49.839 --> 22:51.609
I'm friends with him
on Facebook.

22:54.582 --> 22:57.420
What? For real?

22:57.420 --> 22:59.625
I mean, he's around,
if you wanted to meet him.

22:59.625 --> 23:02.564
You know, you could...

23:02.564 --> 23:04.635
reach out, if you wanted.

23:08.208 --> 23:09.879
What was he like?

23:09.879 --> 23:11.014
White.

23:12.049 --> 23:14.154
My dad's white?

23:14.154 --> 23:16.491
You didn't know?

23:18.228 --> 23:20.032
No, I mean, I...

23:20.032 --> 23:22.170
like, I knew
I was part white, but...

23:22.170 --> 23:25.577
- he's full white?
- Uh, yeah.

23:25.577 --> 23:27.747
I mean, as far as I know.

23:29.551 --> 23:31.522
He was always good to me.

24:06.157 --> 24:07.528
<i>♪ Them damn cold vampires... ♪</i>

24:07.528 --> 24:09.699
I'm so done, man.

24:13.272 --> 24:16.546

24:23.058 --> 24:25.530
