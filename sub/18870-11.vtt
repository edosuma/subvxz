00:01.434 --> 00:02.802
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:02.869 --> 00:04.571
Justin Talbot from CNN.

00:04.637 --> 00:08.475
Justin, as in got-you-fired,
Justin "Asshole" Talbot?

00:08.541 --> 00:10.343
I've never said this to anyone, Kara.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.579
I love you.
Now tell me you don't love me.

00:13.079 --> 00:15.515
If you let me walk out that door,
I'm not coming back.

00:16.149 --> 00:17.550
I think you can go all the way.

00:18.151 --> 00:20.220
- With your help.
- Yeah, with my help.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.622
Getting into the anchor chair
on your birthday.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.656
That's something.

00:24.157 --> 00:26.793
I'm just so sorry that Kara
won't be here to see it.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.962
- What?
- Please, tell her I wish her

00:29.028 --> 00:30.296
the best of luck.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.265
I'm sure she'll land on her feet.

00:37.137 --> 00:39.072
Honestly,
I wasn't thinking about more kids.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.907
Not until Zoe asked me
to be her sperm donor.

00:40.974 --> 00:42.742
But I love you. I want you to be happy.

00:42.809 --> 00:45.412
I never did get a chance to thank you
For helping me get here.

00:45.478 --> 00:47.313
You don't have to thank me. We're a team.

00:52.752 --> 00:53.887
In five,

00:54.921 --> 00:55.855
four,

00:56.790 --> 00:57.724
three,

00:58.658 --> 00:59.626
two...

01:00.493 --> 01:02.862
Good morning, welcome to "Great Day USA."

01:03.163 --> 01:04.164
I'm Mary Jane Paul.

01:08.334 --> 01:09.302
Harder.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.250
That's it. Harder!

01:24.984 --> 01:26.519
Harder! Harder!

01:29.088 --> 01:30.056
Yes.

01:31.257 --> 01:32.225
That's it.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.100
You are certainly upping the ante,

01:41.167 --> 01:42.368
now that you're co-anchor.

01:46.206 --> 01:47.173
I just

01:47.974 --> 01:49.242
wish we had a more suitable

01:49.309 --> 01:51.010
playing field than this.

01:52.812 --> 01:54.214
I'm gonna...

01:54.280 --> 01:56.082
I'm gonna make a decision about the bed.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.116
You'll see.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.086
I wish the designer
hadn't given me so many options.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.492
You're such a perfectionist.

02:05.558 --> 02:06.960
Who doesn't want perfection?

02:07.026 --> 02:09.329
You're letting the perfect
get in the way of the good.

02:15.368 --> 02:18.238
Costa Rican coffee compliments
of Kelly Ripa.

02:23.009 --> 02:23.977
Like it.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.512
Something you won't like.

02:27.714 --> 02:30.517
The caffeine segment is getting pushed.

02:31.618 --> 02:33.720
Emma, two weeks in
and you already know me so well.

02:34.087 --> 02:35.288
So, what are we leading with?

02:36.189 --> 02:37.323
Him.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.492
Is that the director of "Green Point"?

02:40.293 --> 02:43.062
Randy Fulweather.
It took him all of three seconds

02:43.129 --> 02:44.831
to mention that his film won at TIFF.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.232
Why is he so early?

02:46.533 --> 02:48.134
Milking his 15 minutes?

02:52.372 --> 02:54.040
Ten seconds to air, people.

02:57.110 --> 02:58.845
<i>In five, four...</i>

02:59.178 --> 03:00.246
<i>Animation.</i>

03:00.313 --> 03:02.315
<i>- Three.
- Rolling animation.</i>

03:03.283 --> 03:05.184
Good morning, welcome to "Great Day USA."

03:05.251 --> 03:08.388
Tuesday morning kicks off with
breaking news from the music world.

03:08.454 --> 03:10.056
The break-up of an iconic band.

03:10.123 --> 03:12.825
That's right,
Downshift announced they're splitting.

03:12.892 --> 03:14.494
I admit I was blindsided.

03:14.561 --> 03:17.030
- I grew up listening to these guys.
- I mean, we all did.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.299
But there were signs
that trouble was brewing.

03:19.666 --> 03:22.001
This is the kind of banter we need.
It humanizes her.

03:22.468 --> 03:23.636
<i>I mean, the cancellation</i>

03:23.703 --> 03:25.572
<i>of that last concert in Vegas, come on.</i>

03:25.638 --> 03:27.407
<i>- Okay, Sherlock.
- Right. Yeah.</i>

03:28.107 --> 03:31.210
Has anything come across this desk
that has actually surprised you?

03:34.981 --> 03:36.049
<i>I mean, thus far.</i>

03:36.115 --> 03:37.817
<i>I know it's only been a couple of months.</i>

03:38.084 --> 03:39.152
Justin.

03:39.218 --> 03:40.286
You got anything for her?

03:40.553 --> 03:42.989
Yeah, Mary Jane, go to...

03:43.056 --> 03:47.193
<i>Yeah, I know that the fact
that I'm more charming up close,</i>

03:47.260 --> 03:48.895
<i>that was pretty shocking, right?</i>

03:50.530 --> 03:53.266
Yes. Yes. My goodness, what a looker.

03:53.333 --> 03:54.634
That was shocking.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.904
All of a sudden, she's flailing,
and you're asleep at the wheel?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.474
- What the hell's gotten into you two?
- I spaced. It won't happen again.

04:08.247 --> 04:09.582
Look at those shucks at "GDU".

04:09.649 --> 04:11.484
They have my girl all discombobulated.

04:11.551 --> 04:14.020
Stop trying to produce the show
from your living room.

04:14.087 --> 04:16.689
I watch Mary Jane
whether I'm producing her or not.

04:16.756 --> 04:18.124
Okay, they fired you.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.293
I think she'll understand
if you didn't tune in.

04:20.927 --> 04:22.128
Come on, mama, sit down.

04:23.863 --> 04:26.899
Aren't you supposed to be preparing
for the arbitration hearing?

04:26.966 --> 04:28.935
- You only have a couple of days left.
- I know.

04:29.469 --> 04:31.137
- But...
- But what?

04:31.537 --> 04:33.806
- You want them to pay your contract?
- Yeah, I do.

04:34.707 --> 04:36.876
If I lose, I could be blackballed.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.646
- Then don't lose.
- What? Seriously?

04:39.946 --> 04:41.214
I'm serious.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.683
If it's that risky,
then you've gotta win.

04:51.724 --> 04:53.259
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.395
Let's take it for a spin.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.534
Come on, Lee, get up. Get off of the bed.

05:01.601 --> 05:02.902
I'm serious, get off of it!

05:05.471 --> 05:06.739
MJ,

05:07.106 --> 05:08.408
what's gotten into you?

05:08.474 --> 05:09.709
I slept with Justin.

05:13.046 --> 05:14.180
What did you just say?

05:15.348 --> 05:16.683
Did I just say that out loud?

05:17.183 --> 05:18.151
Yeah, you did.

05:18.584 --> 05:21.220
I know I said nothing was going on,
but I lied.

05:21.621 --> 05:22.689
It was only once.

05:22.755 --> 05:25.425
It wasn't like an ongoing thing

05:25.491 --> 05:26.693
or anything like that.

05:26.759 --> 05:29.228
And in your twisted mind,
that makes it better?

05:29.295 --> 05:31.397
- No. No.
- Why are you telling me this now?

05:32.532 --> 05:33.766
Answer me!

05:35.334 --> 05:37.503
- You wanna do it again.
- I have feelings for him.

05:37.570 --> 05:40.006
- I really tried to just push it down.
- Give me a break.

05:40.073 --> 05:44.043
- You've just given yourself permission...
- Don't, Lee, that's not you.

05:44.310 --> 05:45.511
Don't be cruel.

05:46.713 --> 05:47.780
Do you love him?

05:50.516 --> 05:51.484
God.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.254
I mean, I know how much you like
assholes like him.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.057
He's got the swagger in spades,
hasn't he?

05:58.391 --> 06:00.426
Just the kind of guy
to keep you on your toes.

06:00.493 --> 06:03.062
- Is that really what you want?
- I am so sorry.

06:03.129 --> 06:05.264
That's what you're saving
this bed for, isn't it?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.167
Isn't it?

06:09.435 --> 06:10.436
For Justin.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.374
I never meant to hurt you, Lee.

06:15.441 --> 06:17.844
- You're the greatest man I've ever had.
- Just stop it.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.713
You know what I went through
with Zoe, and you still...

06:21.047 --> 06:23.182
I was gonna give you
everything you wanted.

06:24.083 --> 06:25.585
We were trying for a baby.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.955
And I became a different person,

06:29.288 --> 06:30.823
and I owe that all to you.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.226
Don't give me
that new Mary Jane bullshit.

06:33.292 --> 06:35.228
- No, it's true. I've changed.
- Yeah.

06:35.294 --> 06:36.896
No, I did. Look, I tried.

06:36.963 --> 06:37.964
It's okay.

06:38.731 --> 06:39.699
I don't blame you.

06:40.800 --> 06:43.369
Look, you're obviously still
that broken girl

06:43.436 --> 06:44.804
I met on that first night.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.740
It's my fault for trying to put
the pieces back together.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.644
What I see now,

06:52.278 --> 06:53.646
is what you need is a real prick

06:53.713 --> 06:55.948
to try and break you down
into even tinier bits.

06:56.783 --> 06:57.984
I hope Justin delivers.

06:58.384 --> 07:01.220
You don't mean that, Lee. Come on, Lee.

07:01.721 --> 07:02.722
I am...

07:03.156 --> 07:06.092
I'll come back tomorrow
and grab the rest of my stuff.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.227
Please...

07:09.262 --> 07:10.296
You know,

07:11.197 --> 07:13.065
the silver lining in all of this

07:15.434 --> 07:17.203
is that we didn't have a kid together.

07:18.204 --> 07:19.372
You'd be a terrible mom.

07:51.671 --> 07:53.039
<i>- Hello?
- Mom?</i>

07:53.840 --> 07:57.243
Pauletta. I was just thinking
about calling you.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.078
Yeah? Did something happen?

07:59.145 --> 08:02.048
<i>Well, I never told you about
our trip to Hattiesburg.</i>

08:02.582 --> 08:03.649
<i>Okay, how was it?</i>

08:03.716 --> 08:08.588
Pauletta, it's the perfect place
for you and Lee to get married.

08:09.222 --> 08:12.792
- Mom...
- I know that you're in the big city now.

08:12.859 --> 08:15.428
But, Letta, you've got to see this...

08:15.494 --> 08:17.029
I'm gonna stop you right there.

08:17.096 --> 08:19.899
Letta, wouldn't you just consider it?

08:21.033 --> 08:24.704
I would consider it, Mom...

08:25.071 --> 08:27.006
Pauletta, is something wrong?

08:28.174 --> 08:29.508
Lee and I broke up.

08:30.610 --> 08:31.944
I slept with Justin

08:32.011 --> 08:35.848
and tanked a perfect relationship
for no good reason.

08:35.915 --> 08:39.318
Well, no, actually,
there is a good reason.

08:41.153 --> 08:42.521
I'm a selfish bitch.

08:43.189 --> 08:44.156
<i>Pauletta...</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:47.927
And the one person I'm dying
to talk to about it is Kara.

08:48.895 --> 08:52.231
But when she finds out
that I broke up with Lee for Justin,

08:52.298 --> 08:54.634
she's literally going to kill me,

08:55.201 --> 08:56.369
because she hates him,

08:57.203 --> 08:58.137
which I kinda

08:58.938 --> 09:01.607
get because I hated him, too.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.476
And, honestly, I don't know if

09:04.610 --> 09:08.681
I'm falling in love with the devil,
or the man of my dreams,

09:08.748 --> 09:10.016
or maybe both.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.851
Pauletta, I can't hear you, sweetie.

09:12.184 --> 09:13.819
<i>- Are you there?
- I'm here.</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:14.987
<i>Pauletta,</i>

09:15.254 --> 09:16.989
did something happen?

09:17.356 --> 09:18.391
<i>Lee and I,</i>

09:18.691 --> 09:19.725
we broke up.

09:19.792 --> 09:20.927
<i>Broke up?</i>

09:20.993 --> 09:23.729
But that boy just came all the way
to Atlanta

09:23.796 --> 09:24.997
to tell you he loved you.

09:25.264 --> 09:26.198
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

09:26.766 --> 09:28.768
But what happened?

09:32.505 --> 09:33.973
I really thought I was ready to...

09:34.473 --> 09:36.609
To talk about it, mom, but I'm not.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.811
<i>Pauletta?</i>

09:39.445 --> 09:41.314
You know, I'm gonna call you back, okay?

09:41.914 --> 09:43.282
Because I can't...

09:44.083 --> 09:45.384
<i>I can't right now, mom.</i>

09:46.152 --> 09:47.086
I love you, mom.

09:54.226 --> 09:55.194
- Hi
- Hi.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.932
Listen, I think we need to talk.

09:59.999 --> 10:01.067
Yeah.

10:01.767 --> 10:05.037
I know that we agreed to keep
everything professional.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.074
Which made sense at the time.

10:08.374 --> 10:11.911
Yeah. But given what's been happening,

10:11.978 --> 10:14.180
I think we owe it to ourselves

10:14.246 --> 10:16.148
to revisit that conversation, don't you?

10:16.649 --> 10:17.850
I agree.

10:23.856 --> 10:25.291
Why don't we grab a drink later,

10:25.891 --> 10:27.326
so we can have some privacy?

10:27.593 --> 10:28.694
Yeah.

10:28.761 --> 10:31.464
Can I borrow you for a few minutes?
I need to show you something.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.432
There you go.

10:35.001 --> 10:36.302
The overnights.

10:36.369 --> 10:37.837
This has gotta be a new low.

10:37.903 --> 10:40.539
Guys, listen, we knew
Ronda's departure was gonna cost us.

10:40.606 --> 10:43.175
We can't cry over something
we already knew would happen.

10:43.242 --> 10:44.343
For a few weeks, yes.

10:45.011 --> 10:46.412
It's been two months,

10:46.479 --> 10:49.448
and now with Ronda's promo
buzzing online, I...

10:49.515 --> 10:50.683
Ronda has a promo?

10:50.750 --> 10:53.519
Her talk show isn't even supposed to air
until next fall.

10:53.586 --> 10:56.188
"Vanity Fair" did an article
calling her "The Next Oprah."

10:56.255 --> 10:57.456
Let's remind ourselves

10:57.523 --> 10:59.358
Ronda's show will air in the afternoon.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.361
- We're not in direct competition.
- No, you're right.

11:02.695 --> 11:05.531
But the mood upstairs
has changed significantly.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.567
Sawyer is concerned
that our show is out of step.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.536
Mary Jane is still finding her voice,

11:11.337 --> 11:13.706
and I have a segment
that'll give us the boost we need.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.808
- Yeah? And what's that?
- Dylan Avery.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.878
He's gonna give us
the exclusive on his new movie.

11:18.944 --> 11:20.112
The 80s action star?

11:20.379 --> 11:22.381
Does anybody really still care about him?

11:22.648 --> 11:24.517
Are you kidding? He's like a legend.

11:24.583 --> 11:26.986
-"Russian Winter" is one of my favorites.
- Mine too.

11:27.053 --> 11:29.221
His latest film
is getting all this festival buzz

11:29.288 --> 11:31.657
and he's starting to garner
a lot of Oscar attention.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.960
- It could be this year's come-back story.
- I've got something better.

11:35.027 --> 11:37.530
- Yeah?
- There's been all this controversy

11:37.596 --> 11:40.232
about what really happened
between Ronda and Mary Jane,

11:40.299 --> 11:42.935
so, let's put Ronda on and clear it up.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.471
She's been discredited.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.940
It would completely undermine
her reputation.

11:48.007 --> 11:50.743
- The fans don't care about any of that.
- Well, we should.

11:50.810 --> 11:53.079
And Kara's still in the middle
of her arbitration.

11:53.145 --> 11:56.816
Our lawyers said that they can prep
Ronda about what she can and cannot say.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.552
If Sawyer wants ratings,
give him ratings.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.921
By any means necessary.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.157
So, Ronda returns to "GDU"
to set the record straight.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.460
See? Aaron's got the spirit.

12:07.526 --> 12:09.095
I'll gladly do the interview.

12:09.161 --> 12:12.398
I'm sorry, is this "Great Day USA,"

12:12.465 --> 12:15.701
or "Real News Anchors New York:
The Reunion?"

12:15.768 --> 12:16.902
I'm not sure.

12:16.969 --> 12:19.171
You do realize that Ronda

12:19.238 --> 12:22.108
can come on live TV and trash us all?

12:22.174 --> 12:23.709
That's true, Mary Jane.

12:24.376 --> 12:27.179
But I guarantee
that everyone will be watching.

12:27.246 --> 12:28.547
We have a show to do, okay?

12:28.948 --> 12:30.082
All right, guys.

12:30.349 --> 12:31.317
Let's go.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.260
- Come on, how can you play like that?
- Morning.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.628
Kara, what's up?

12:42.695 --> 12:44.396
They just came by to hang out for a bit.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.132
It's 8 a.m., babe?

12:46.198 --> 12:48.634
My gosh! Seriously? Seriously?

12:50.436 --> 12:52.204
- It's spilling everywhere.
- Sorry.

12:52.571 --> 12:54.607
Don't you have a team breakfast
this morning?

12:54.673 --> 12:57.176
- Yeah. I thought I might skip this one.
- Why?

12:57.243 --> 12:58.844
It was supposed to be just the team

12:58.911 --> 13:01.347
then the guys invited
their wives and girlfriends.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.283
- So? That's never stopped you before.
- It's not that big a deal.

13:04.583 --> 13:05.951
What's not that big a deal?

13:06.018 --> 13:07.520
I wasn't invited, okay?

13:07.586 --> 13:09.588
Does this have anything to do
with what I said

13:09.655 --> 13:12.525
to Eddie's wife,
that 20-year-old hood rat?

13:12.591 --> 13:15.761
- Okay, I'll call her and apologize.
- I don't think that's gonna cut it.

13:15.828 --> 13:17.530
Why? Is she too good for an apology,

13:17.963 --> 13:19.165
spoiled-ass bitch?

13:19.231 --> 13:20.900
You kind of insulted all of them.

13:21.267 --> 13:22.635
I insulted them.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.104
Look, it'll die down eventually.

13:25.371 --> 13:28.040
No, I can't have you shut out
of your team.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.441
That's your family.

13:30.609 --> 13:31.810
Baby...

13:33.579 --> 13:36.148
You have more than enough
to think about right now.

13:37.249 --> 13:38.784
Okay? Don't you?

13:52.965 --> 13:54.633
So, I hope you don't mind.

13:54.700 --> 13:55.868
I ordered for you.

13:55.935 --> 13:58.571
This place makes almost
the perfect Manhattan,

13:58.871 --> 14:01.173
as close as you get
to perfect in Chelsea now.

14:02.341 --> 14:03.842
Well, what if I want perfection?

14:04.310 --> 14:06.612
You go downtown.
There's a hole-in-the-wall

14:06.679 --> 14:08.380
about a block away from Wall Street.

14:08.447 --> 14:10.216
They make the perfect Manhattan.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.951
You're sounding like a native.

14:17.389 --> 14:20.226
You know, what happened today
really caught me off guard.

14:20.292 --> 14:22.795
- Me, too.
- Well, another slip-up just can't happen.

14:22.861 --> 14:25.531
Okay. What's happening between us is

14:27.233 --> 14:28.534
obvious.

14:29.468 --> 14:32.238
I'm ready to embrace it, finally.

14:32.805 --> 14:34.006
Just put it out there.

14:34.073 --> 14:35.474
I'm gonna stop you right there.

14:35.941 --> 14:38.877
What happened yesterday
can't happen again.

14:39.178 --> 14:41.013
I mean, we're talking about our careers.

14:41.347 --> 14:44.583
And Garrett, right now,
he's running scared.

14:44.650 --> 14:47.686
So, I think I should just start

14:47.753 --> 14:50.155
you know, start to produce
Aaron's stories.

14:52.925 --> 14:55.060
- What?
- It's the prudent thing to do.

14:56.795 --> 14:57.863
I get it.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.932
You're distancing yourself

14:59.999 --> 15:02.401
because the noose is tightening
around Kara's neck

15:02.468 --> 15:03.736
and I could be next. I get it.

15:05.237 --> 15:07.172
This isn't me hedging my bets.

15:08.340 --> 15:10.142
No, I'm clear about what it is, actually.

15:10.476 --> 15:12.745
No, I'm actually really clear.
I broke up with Lee.

15:16.682 --> 15:17.783
But why?

15:18.884 --> 15:20.819
I didn't ask you to do that.

15:22.621 --> 15:25.090
What's happening between us
isn't all in my head.

15:25.357 --> 15:27.993
Look, we had sex, once.

15:28.894 --> 15:29.828
All right?

15:30.296 --> 15:32.464
And we both agreed that it was a mistake.

15:34.266 --> 15:35.634
This isn't...

15:36.802 --> 15:37.970
This isn't love.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.105
I have a girlfriend,

15:41.874 --> 15:45.411
and I'm not gonna ruin
the relationship for...

15:45.844 --> 15:46.912
For what?

15:50.616 --> 15:53.619
I'm not gonna blow up my world
on a whim, okay?

15:54.653 --> 15:55.988
And you shouldn't want me to.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.190
I don't want you to.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.294
I don't want you to do anything.
I'm glad we're...

16:03.062 --> 16:04.396
I'm glad we're clear.

16:06.732 --> 16:09.268
- Mary Jane.
- No, enjoy your Manhattan.

17:35.454 --> 17:37.823
Yeah, so, I've been hitting
the rings quite a bit.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.627
Sorry to interrupt.
I just wanted to let you know

17:41.693 --> 17:43.762
I've reached out
to the brand strategy team.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.365
We wanna improve ratings, right?

17:46.698 --> 17:48.767
They're gonna present ideas
on how to retool,

17:48.834 --> 17:50.869
and I really think
that we should think about

17:50.936 --> 17:52.805
making some changes
to the producing team.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.442
Okay, well, we're already
considering options

17:56.508 --> 17:57.743
for Kara's replacement.

17:57.810 --> 18:00.012
Let's not get hung up on that one slot.

18:00.078 --> 18:02.714
- Fresh faces bring fresh ideas.
- I can't agree more.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.451
Lastly, I think Emma
should interview Ronda.

18:05.717 --> 18:07.352
She doesn't even know Ronda.

18:07.653 --> 18:10.289
I think we all know
that I'm not a big fan of the story,

18:10.589 --> 18:13.725
but we can position Emma as the newcomer

18:13.792 --> 18:15.861
to this happy "GDU" family,

18:15.928 --> 18:20.866
who's learned of our troubling history
and just wants answers.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.334
Aaron will never go for that.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.736
Well, it's not up for Aaron to decide.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.511
You...

18:33.412 --> 18:34.546
You good with this idea?

18:34.613 --> 18:36.482
Yeah. It could shake things up a bit.

18:44.056 --> 18:45.224
I know what you're doing.

18:45.491 --> 18:47.059
This is about last night.

18:48.126 --> 18:49.628
This isn't about you, Justin.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.397
- No?
- You were spot-on

18:52.664 --> 18:54.233
with everything you said last night.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.069
We should both focus on our careers,

18:57.135 --> 18:59.771
especially now
with Garrett running scared.

18:59.838 --> 19:02.474
Ronda could be coming here
to bury us on live TV.

19:02.541 --> 19:04.676
Aaron can counter it, Emma can't.

19:05.344 --> 19:08.780
Is it us you're worried about
getting trashed or you?

19:14.019 --> 19:15.153
Are you serious?

19:15.420 --> 19:18.190
You know, I realized
that I should thank you,

19:19.224 --> 19:21.226
because, if we were together, I mean...

19:21.593 --> 19:24.463
I wouldn't have had the balls
to pitch any of this.

19:24.963 --> 19:27.432
I would have been too concerned
about your ego.

19:28.433 --> 19:29.902
But now...

19:32.004 --> 19:33.005
I don't give a shit.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.578
Okay.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.883
I don't believe it.

19:45.651 --> 19:48.220
- You don't believe what?
- I just spoke with Lee.

19:48.287 --> 19:50.756
and he said Pauletta stepped out on him.

19:50.822 --> 19:53.959
- You called that boy on the phone?
- But not knowing what was happening

19:54.026 --> 19:55.193
was giving me heartburn.

19:55.260 --> 19:58.230
- And he told you Pauletta is cheating?
- I had to pull it out of him.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.132
It cuts straight to the quick,
doesn't it?

20:02.634 --> 20:03.635
Baby...

20:05.237 --> 20:08.440
Do you think our missteps

20:08.941 --> 20:13.579
has anything to do
with all the troubles she's having?

20:13.645 --> 20:14.980
No, no...

20:15.047 --> 20:16.515
She was just a child

20:17.983 --> 20:19.751
when all that business was going' on.

20:20.319 --> 20:22.054
Kids pick up on things.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.690
Now I know it's been a long time,

20:27.492 --> 20:29.494
- but maybe we should talk to her.
- No!

20:32.464 --> 20:34.099
What we should do

20:36.168 --> 20:37.502
is call the realtor.

20:37.569 --> 20:38.704
The realtor?

20:38.770 --> 20:41.807
We are gonna put that Hattiesburg house
up for sale.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.710
Helen, we've gotta face facts.

20:49.114 --> 20:51.783
Pauletta will never get married
in that house.

20:56.955 --> 20:58.123
The pleasure's all mine.

20:58.190 --> 20:59.725
Is this the PR presentation?

20:59.791 --> 21:02.761
Actually, we're more brand strategy
than PR.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.897
- Lyla Fugate.
- Justin Talbot. Nice to meet you.

21:06.331 --> 21:08.967
Lyla has some ideas
on how to improve my Q rating.

21:09.801 --> 21:12.170
We'd like to start by bringing in
some new stylists

21:12.237 --> 21:15.240
and we've compiled a list of charities
that are trending right now.

21:16.074 --> 21:17.909
These sound like some great ideas,

21:17.976 --> 21:20.479
but it seems like
we're offering solutions

21:20.545 --> 21:22.414
when the problem hasn't been identified.

21:22.681 --> 21:24.650
The market research shows

21:24.716 --> 21:27.019
that you're not quite connecting
to viewers.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.590
Yeah, I mean, well, why?

21:32.124 --> 21:34.059
The Real Housewives Factor.

21:34.660 --> 21:36.862
Viewers haven't been given
the opportunity...

21:36.928 --> 21:39.998
No, I could swear somebody said something
about The Real Housewives?

21:44.603 --> 21:47.973
This is Aaliyah Luckett,
our new junior associate.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.508
Hi. Please...

21:50.108 --> 21:52.077
There's an official PR term for it,

21:52.144 --> 21:54.079
but I call it The Real Housewives Factor.

21:54.346 --> 21:56.982
It's similar to how we define
likeability for men.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.384
During George W's campaign,
people would say,

21:59.451 --> 22:01.720
"He's the kinda guy
I'd like to have a beer with."

22:01.787 --> 22:03.255
So, that became the litmus test.

22:03.321 --> 22:06.224
For women, it's would you watch
trashy reality shows?

22:06.291 --> 22:08.193
Take, for instance, Michelle Obama.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.996
Could you kick back and watch
"The Real Housewives" with her?

22:11.063 --> 22:12.197
Yeah, sure.

22:12.264 --> 22:13.732
- Jennifer Lawrence?
- Yeah.

22:13.799 --> 22:14.833
Hillary Clinton?

22:16.301 --> 22:17.769
Isn't this stuff kind of innate?

22:17.836 --> 22:20.238
I mean, Hillary is no Michelle, so...

22:20.505 --> 22:22.507
No, we can change it.

22:23.275 --> 22:25.944
We just need a bridge
into Mary Jane's personal life.

22:26.578 --> 22:29.247
Kelly Ripa has Mark Consuelos
and her kids.

22:29.314 --> 22:30.582
Gayle King has Oprah.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.518
Okay, well, I'm not married with kids

22:33.585 --> 22:35.620
and I don't have
a billionaire bestie, so...

22:35.687 --> 22:38.156
- But you're single, right?
- Yes, newly single.

22:38.757 --> 22:40.392
And guys wanna date you.

22:40.459 --> 22:44.196
That's so nice of you to say, but I...

22:44.496 --> 22:46.598
No, that director you had on the show,

22:46.665 --> 22:49.167
Randy Fulweather,
he was asking about you.

22:49.234 --> 22:51.737
I'm not sure I wanna date a director

22:51.803 --> 22:53.305
to improve my Q rating.

22:53.371 --> 22:54.873
I think it'll humanize you.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.410
You know what? Yeah, set it up.

22:58.477 --> 23:00.612
It's gonna be a huge upgrade
from the last one,

23:00.679 --> 23:02.114
so, yeah, that's great.

23:02.180 --> 23:06.184
Okay, well, if you hit it off with him,
we can keep it private,

23:06.251 --> 23:09.821
but dating him would create
a lot of buzz.

23:09.888 --> 23:10.822
Fantastic.

23:11.156 --> 23:12.524
Buzz is what it's all about.

23:16.261 --> 23:18.296
Russ and Daughters?

23:19.064 --> 23:21.800
Yes! My gosh, I'd say you shouldn't have.

23:21.867 --> 23:22.934
But you know what?

23:23.001 --> 23:25.904
Orlando and his boys
are eating me out of house and home!

23:26.204 --> 23:27.506
Okay, what's the occasion?

23:27.572 --> 23:29.674
Well, I know you're gonna get
a new gig soon,

23:29.741 --> 23:32.677
and we're not gonna have opportunities
for me to pop up for lunch.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.913
You act like the job offers
are rolling in.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.315
I made some calls,
just seeing what's out there, so?

23:38.483 --> 23:40.519
Well, shouldn't you be focusing on "GDU"?

23:41.520 --> 23:43.188
You're rattled. I see it, you know?

23:44.589 --> 23:45.857
It's Justin, isn't it?

23:45.924 --> 23:48.894
No, no, it's that damn Ronda.

23:49.227 --> 23:51.396
So, Garrett's really bringing her
on the show?

23:52.264 --> 23:54.032
I swear that bitch has like nine lives.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.368
- Or ten.
- You know what? Ronda's not the problem.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.502
You've got the yips.

23:58.370 --> 24:01.540
That's what Orlando calls it
when their teammates are off their game.

24:01.606 --> 24:04.442
But I'm not surprised.
You have no one over there you can trust.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.878
The other producers
are totally intimidated by you,

24:06.945 --> 24:08.814
and Justin is a fricking snake.

24:08.880 --> 24:10.549
Can't argue with you there.

24:10.615 --> 24:11.850
You need to make sure

24:12.217 --> 24:15.387
that whoever they hire as my replacement
is an ally and has your back.

24:15.654 --> 24:16.621
- Okay?
- Okay.

24:18.123 --> 24:19.191
What time is it?

24:19.524 --> 24:21.459
It's gotta be a quarter to one
or something.

24:21.860 --> 24:24.196
- My God, I've gotta get ready.
- Why? What's going on?

24:24.262 --> 24:27.766
- I thought arbitration started tomorrow.
- I agreed to watch Orlando's game

24:27.833 --> 24:28.800
with all the wives.

24:29.601 --> 24:33.071
- Are you making friends?
- Girl, my man is being ostracized,

24:33.138 --> 24:34.539
so, I've gotta do something.

24:34.606 --> 24:37.542
What do I have in common
with all those airheads

24:37.609 --> 24:39.578
who suck you-know-what for a living.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.681
What if I bring Lee?

24:44.449 --> 24:46.985
He's so fricking funny.

24:47.052 --> 24:49.254
No, Lee is unavailable.

24:49.855 --> 24:50.789
Why?

24:51.122 --> 24:52.290
He's in San...

24:52.357 --> 24:53.291
Orlando.

24:53.959 --> 24:55.260
But maybe I can help you.

24:56.094 --> 24:57.062
Girl.

24:57.729 --> 24:58.697
Please.

24:59.064 --> 25:01.499
You have absolutely nothing in common

25:01.566 --> 25:02.834
with those airheads either.

25:03.501 --> 25:06.471
Hello? I connect with strangers
for a living,

25:06.538 --> 25:09.307
five days a week, live, on air.
I got you.

25:09.574 --> 25:12.077
Yeah, that's because you had me
as your producer,

25:12.143 --> 25:13.979
giving you the background information.

25:14.045 --> 25:17.182
Having the information
is not the same as using the information.

25:17.616 --> 25:19.251
I can get those bitches to like me.

25:19.317 --> 25:21.553
Everything about their lives
is on social media,

25:21.620 --> 25:24.456
so, all I have to do is make them think
that they're fascinating.

25:24.723 --> 25:26.091
You think it's that easy?

25:26.157 --> 25:29.027
They're gonna be begging to hang out
with me by the end of the game.

25:29.094 --> 25:30.061
Watch.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.301
My God.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.371
<i>Having your favorite players warm up.</i>

25:44.009 --> 25:45.210
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.544
Do you wanna do a shot with me?

25:46.845 --> 25:49.414
No, Tequila's 70 calories an ounce.

25:50.982 --> 25:52.450
God forbid you have a calorie.

25:55.253 --> 25:56.821
A double shot, please.

25:58.857 --> 26:00.058
My kinda woman.

26:00.492 --> 26:02.294
It helps with the pre-game jitters.

26:02.360 --> 26:03.561
Yes, it does.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.331
I thought I was the only one
with anxiety about the game.

26:06.765 --> 26:07.699
No.

26:09.467 --> 26:11.102
Lauryn, come take a selfie with us.

26:11.736 --> 26:12.737
Coming!

26:15.874 --> 26:17.876
Girls, let me do that for you.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.577
Here, let me have your phone.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.247
You want the brightest source of light
all around you,

26:22.314 --> 26:24.883
so you avoid all those harsh shadows,
you know what I mean?

26:24.950 --> 26:26.451
So, get together.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.687
Look at y'all rocking it on. I love it.

26:29.187 --> 26:30.655
Sexy ladies.

26:31.556 --> 26:32.590
Yes!

26:33.725 --> 26:34.993
Excellent. Look at that.

26:35.927 --> 26:37.595
- My God.
- All right?

26:37.662 --> 26:38.964
That's so nice.

26:39.264 --> 26:41.733
You should be our official selfie taker.

26:42.667 --> 26:44.069
I would be honored.

26:44.903 --> 26:45.904
My God.

26:51.810 --> 26:52.911
Smart move.

26:52.978 --> 26:55.747
Appeal to their vanity
and the fact that you're in television

26:55.814 --> 26:58.116
and you know
what you're talking about, even better.

26:59.718 --> 27:00.785
Are you in television?

27:01.119 --> 27:04.389
No. I'm Lauryn Wellington.
I'm Daimond's girlfriend.

27:05.924 --> 27:08.126
I'm like the rest of them,
just not as backward.

27:12.063 --> 27:13.598
We should go shopping this week.

27:15.800 --> 27:18.837
Barneys is having a blue-ribbon sale
and I have been dying to know

27:19.371 --> 27:22.407
who is this woman
who has stolen Orlando's heart?

27:29.981 --> 27:31.316
So, it opens in Prague.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.586
I didn't know that. That's impressive.

27:35.754 --> 27:38.123
- Well, the studio really believes in it.
- Thanks.

27:41.593 --> 27:42.994
Of course, I won't be there.

27:43.661 --> 27:45.697
No? Well, I'm sure the New York premiere

27:45.764 --> 27:47.365
will be just as fun, right?

27:47.766 --> 27:49.200
I won't be there, either.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.403
I wanna see it in Oakland with my people.

27:51.736 --> 27:54.272
If it sucks, they won't have a problem
letting me know it.

27:55.106 --> 27:56.274
You're brave.

27:56.341 --> 27:58.443
My family would be the loudest critics,

27:58.777 --> 28:00.879
then ask me for money a second later.

28:01.312 --> 28:02.814
You sure that's your family?

28:02.881 --> 28:04.916
That sounds like something
my niece would do.

28:04.983 --> 28:06.818
Your family summers
in the South of France.

28:07.886 --> 28:09.721
No, you've pegged me all wrong, brother.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.057
No, I'm the daughter of Helen Patterson

28:12.123 --> 28:13.658
from Hattiesburg, Mississippi,

28:13.725 --> 28:16.161
and the only French word
that she knows is "souvenir."

28:16.227 --> 28:18.263
You had me fooled.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.965
And you're a lot more approachable
than I thought.

28:21.266 --> 28:22.367
You know,

28:22.934 --> 28:25.136
I was surprised
when you agreed to see me tonight.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.704
Really? Why?

28:27.138 --> 28:30.275
Well, one of your producers
told me you were seeing someone.

28:32.944 --> 28:34.379
Which producer?

28:34.446 --> 28:35.947
That brother with the light eyes.

28:41.419 --> 28:42.587
I mean, I was

28:43.354 --> 28:44.522
in a relationship.

28:44.589 --> 28:45.824
I used to be.

28:46.291 --> 28:47.325
But I'm not.

28:48.026 --> 28:49.127
He was wrong.

28:49.194 --> 28:50.161
He's...

28:50.995 --> 28:52.931
He's wrong about so much.

28:54.332 --> 28:57.235
Thanks, Hannah, for that look
at the weather around the nation.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.504
And now let's take a look
at the weather in your area.

28:59.838 --> 29:01.072
<i>And we're clear.</i>

29:06.277 --> 29:07.345
Morning, Mary Jane.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.614
The second part of the presentation
will be here.

29:09.681 --> 29:10.682
Great, thanks.

29:15.019 --> 29:16.855
- How're you doing?
- Okay.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.824
Are you going to arbitration
or going to meet the Queen?

29:20.291 --> 29:22.794
This, my darling, was Orlando's doing.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.363
I take it everything went well
with the WAGs.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.966
Orlando certainly thought so
after he saw this picture.

29:28.032 --> 29:29.567
You're gonna love this.

29:31.269 --> 29:33.371
- It really looks like you're having fun.
- Right?

29:33.771 --> 29:35.440
I mean, they weren't all that bad.

29:35.507 --> 29:37.575
I mean, there was one of them
that I kinda like.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.145
What? Mean girl Kara Lynch made a friend?

29:40.645 --> 29:41.646
Yay!

29:42.447 --> 29:44.616
Anyway, I just thought I'd come by
and say hello.

29:44.682 --> 29:46.584
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

29:46.651 --> 29:47.619
We just...

29:50.255 --> 29:52.123
Maybe that wasn't such a good idea, though.

29:53.258 --> 29:55.493
- Ronda!
- Mary Jane.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.896
- Welcome back.
- Thank you so much.

29:58.730 --> 30:02.000
It's like old times.
Us ladies back together again.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.537
Although I do see brand strategy, right?

30:05.603 --> 30:07.872
Lyla. Not just Lyla, the whole team.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.307
The whole department.

30:09.374 --> 30:11.509
As you know,
morning news is serious business.

30:11.776 --> 30:13.811
The bigger the team,
the bigger the problem.

30:13.878 --> 30:16.648
Those pesky little ratings
must be really rattling some cages.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.118
So, what did they recommend?

30:20.185 --> 30:23.354
Charity work? A new image?

30:23.421 --> 30:25.857
No, since you are not married,

30:26.257 --> 30:28.693
maybe they're gonna target
a few red carpet events

30:28.760 --> 30:30.161
with a high-profile bachelor.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.030
Now that sounds like fun, doesn't it?

30:32.096 --> 30:33.331
You know, Ronda,

30:35.333 --> 30:37.035
don't you have to get to make-up?

30:37.502 --> 30:39.704
You know, you need some concealer.

30:40.238 --> 30:42.540
I think I wanna say hi to Garrett, first.

30:43.274 --> 30:45.710
I wanna see the desperation up close.

30:46.444 --> 30:49.214
And maybe I should take the time
to see Justin, too.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.884
They don't have any recommendations
for him, do they?

30:53.451 --> 30:54.452
No.

30:55.787 --> 30:56.921
It's all on you.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.990
You know what?
I'm gonna be just fine, Ronda.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.292
Yeah, brand strategy,
they do know their stuff.

31:01.359 --> 31:02.460
But heaven forbid

31:03.328 --> 31:05.663
you just do your damn job.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.534
You can't help yourself, can you?

31:09.601 --> 31:12.370
Sweetheart,
you've only yourself to blame.

31:12.437 --> 31:13.404
Make up.

31:13.671 --> 31:15.273
- Really.
- If you'll excuse me.

31:15.340 --> 31:16.374
Yes.

31:20.445 --> 31:21.546
Stop it!

31:21.846 --> 31:25.516
Do not let that bitch
get the best of you, Mary Jane.

31:25.583 --> 31:27.719
Right, and I was gonna say
the same thing to you,

31:27.785 --> 31:29.754
so, you go up there
and give them hell, okay?

31:29.821 --> 31:30.989
- I will.
- Okay?

31:32.156 --> 31:33.091
You got this.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.493
Yeah.

31:35.793 --> 31:36.761
Thank you.

31:42.500 --> 31:45.303
<i>I covered a story
that turned out to be false.</i>

31:45.370 --> 31:47.805
<i>It is something I'm not proud of,
but it's the truth.</i>

31:47.872 --> 31:51.009
So, there's nothing to the rumors
of you getting pushed out?

31:52.210 --> 31:56.147
I take pride in mentoring journalists.

31:56.214 --> 31:58.750
Is my colleague Mary Jane Paul
included in that?

31:59.050 --> 32:00.084
Absolutely.

32:00.918 --> 32:03.821
<i>People out there
want to think there is a bad guy.</i>

32:04.722 --> 32:06.024
There's no bad guy here.

32:06.424 --> 32:08.092
<i>Now, some people assume</i>

32:08.159 --> 32:12.530
that I am going to be sticking with fluff
from now on, after what happened.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.966
But they would be wrong.
The work is too important.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.067
<i>I told my producers,</i>

32:16.134 --> 32:19.570
<i>"Please, do not shy away
from the big stories,</i>

32:19.637 --> 32:20.772
especially now.

32:21.172 --> 32:22.640
We are going to be there."

32:23.041 --> 32:25.743
Do you plan to tackle
controversial topics on you talk show?

32:25.810 --> 32:27.578
That's right. This fall.

32:27.645 --> 32:30.782
And this time, I will not leave
the vetting to producers.

32:31.115 --> 32:35.019
I will be fact-checking
and corroborating stories myself,

32:35.320 --> 32:36.754
<i>through and through.</i>

32:37.455 --> 32:39.657
We just handed her a promo opportunity.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.259
Yeah, check out our Twitter page.

32:42.393 --> 32:44.262
Our viewers are eating it up.

32:47.865 --> 32:49.000
Mary Jane?

32:49.467 --> 32:50.435
Justin.

32:50.768 --> 32:52.537
- At least Ronda didn't tank us.
- Yet.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.972
You know that old bitch
has more tricks up her sleeve.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.742
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I was sent to grab you two

32:57.809 --> 33:00.111
for part two of our presentation,
if you're ready.

33:00.178 --> 33:01.312
Yes, no problem.

33:01.379 --> 33:03.681
- The meeting's in your office, Mary Jane.
- Great.

33:04.015 --> 33:05.650
So, the director, cool, right?

33:06.484 --> 33:08.786
Leah, I was pleasantly surprised.

33:09.153 --> 33:12.023
I'm sorry, it's actually Aaliyah,
double "a".

33:12.557 --> 33:14.359
My boss Lyla always mispronounces it.

33:14.425 --> 33:16.761
You know, you don't even have to explain.
I got it.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.596
So, are you gonna see him again?

33:18.663 --> 33:21.132
I'm one step ahead of you.
I invited him to dinner.

33:21.199 --> 33:24.035
- You're gonna cook for him?
- That's not too forward, right?

33:24.102 --> 33:25.203
No, that's boss.

33:25.536 --> 33:28.439
I was thinking of some Manchego tarts.

33:29.006 --> 33:30.775
A nice aperitif?

33:31.075 --> 33:33.311
Cocktails, honey. A perfect Manhattan.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.750
There she is. How did it go?

33:38.816 --> 33:40.685
- Did they offer to settle?
- Not quite.

33:41.486 --> 33:42.587
But it's looking good?

33:42.887 --> 33:44.622
I mean, I think so.

33:45.923 --> 33:48.826
Then why are you putting your keys
in the refrigerator?

33:54.632 --> 33:56.367
Mama? What happened?

34:00.104 --> 34:04.642
Those damn "GDU" lawyers
twisted everything that I said.

34:06.110 --> 34:09.847
Here I am trying to be honest
about being a single mother...

34:09.914 --> 34:11.949
- They twisted it how?
- I don't know.

34:13.151 --> 34:15.620
They tried to make it seem
like I don't need the money.

34:15.953 --> 34:17.188
How does that even matter?

34:17.255 --> 34:18.489
It doesn't matter, but...

34:21.692 --> 34:22.760
Never mind.

34:23.728 --> 34:25.563
No, no, tell me.

34:27.465 --> 34:28.766
It's about perception.

34:29.934 --> 34:32.437
There you were sitting
in that expensive outfit, right?

34:33.504 --> 34:35.773
Well, it wasn't just that. I was...

34:37.175 --> 34:40.578
- I went to the game and...
- The stuff in the Skybox?

34:40.945 --> 34:43.748
You were on the Jumbo Tron
with the rest of the wives. You serious?

34:47.118 --> 34:50.154
I just need to be focused
on finding a new job.

34:50.221 --> 34:53.291
- That's it. That's what I have to do.
- You can't just give up like that.

34:53.357 --> 34:54.959
It feels hopeless, I know.

34:56.294 --> 34:57.328
But you can't give up.

34:59.096 --> 35:01.299
You've gotta keep going.
You've gotta fight.

35:11.242 --> 35:12.810
Okay. Let's see.

35:45.376 --> 35:46.844
Dude is way early.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.458
- Justin, what are you doing here?
- I think we need to talk.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.527
Whatever you need to say to me,
do it at work.

36:02.593 --> 36:03.728
Two minutes.

36:06.497 --> 36:09.467
I think what's been happening between us,

36:09.767 --> 36:11.168
I think we both realize that

36:14.205 --> 36:15.406
it's become untenable.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.074
Yeah, you made that clear at the bar.

36:17.141 --> 36:20.278
Look, I'm not here to rehash
our earlier conversation.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.146
Okay, why are you here, exactly?

36:22.213 --> 36:25.316
Because, as you can see,
I'm expecting someone else, so...

36:25.816 --> 36:26.951
I tried it my way.

36:29.820 --> 36:30.955
It didn't work.

36:31.455 --> 36:33.791
Okay, well, I've moved on.

36:37.428 --> 36:38.663
Don't say that.

36:39.797 --> 36:41.532
- Justin, go home.
- Mary Jane.

36:41.599 --> 36:44.402
- I'm serious. Go home to your girlfriend.
- I don't have one.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.309
Not anymore.

36:52.076 --> 36:53.044
We're even.

36:55.379 --> 36:56.347
Go home.

37:04.221 --> 37:05.823
This director that's coming over...

37:07.391 --> 37:08.559
I can't...

37:15.833 --> 37:17.168
I can't stand

37:19.670 --> 37:20.805
the thought of you

37:22.740 --> 37:24.041
with someone else.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.919
We are oil and water.
We don't agree on...

37:34.986 --> 37:35.953
I can't

37:38.856 --> 37:40.358
be without you right now.

37:45.262 --> 37:46.397
I can't.

37:50.134 --> 37:51.168
I can't.

38:00.678 --> 38:01.712
Please.

38:56.233 --> 38:57.334
You were right.

38:59.837 --> 39:01.105
About what?

39:04.275 --> 39:07.078
I hate that you said it out loud,
but "common wisdom

39:08.212 --> 39:10.281
says that this is a huge mistake."

39:11.982 --> 39:13.884
From our jobs, to Kara,

39:14.885 --> 39:16.187
and how it even began.

39:23.561 --> 39:24.962
Aren't you gonna say anything?

39:31.936 --> 39:33.370
There's only one solution.

39:35.873 --> 39:37.074
And what's that?

39:37.908 --> 39:39.376
Let's not be common.

39:42.046 --> 39:43.114
Justin.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.134
Damn, I forgot.
