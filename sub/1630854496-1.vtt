09:09.966 --> 09:11.092
Ice cream "kuhn."

09:11.134 --> 09:12.177
- Ice cream cone.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.303
- Ice cream "kuhn."

09:13.345 --> 09:14.596
- Ice cream cone.

09:14.637 --> 09:15.764
- Oh, it's an ice cream cone?
- Yes.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.931
- Oh, okay.
Yeah, I got it.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.600
- Oh.
- Oh, my God, is that him?

09:18.641 --> 09:20.769
- Yes, our star has arrived!

09:20.810 --> 09:22.395
That's my assistant, Heidi.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.356
- I'm his assistant, Heidi!
- See?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.776
- Hi!
Bice to meet you, Bumper!

09:27.817 --> 09:29.486
I was just fixing
the toilet paper

09:29.527 --> 09:30.695
so it rolled the right way.

09:30.737 --> 09:33.031
- Over, not under, right?
- Uh, you know it.

09:33.073 --> 09:34.699
I'm not
a literal serial killer.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.117
[laughter]
- Totally.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.620
And whoa,
I can barely hear your accent.

09:38.661 --> 09:40.622
- Oh! Oh, no, no, no.
I'm American.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.832
I was an army brat
and just never left.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.709
- Oh.
- Heidi is amazing, Bumper.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.419
She'll be your assistant too.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.963
- Speaking of,
you are going to want...

09:50.173 --> 09:51.549
This.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.843
It is very hard to find
American cheese in Germany,

09:53.885 --> 09:55.720
and you have no idea
how addicted you are

09:55.762 --> 09:57.806
to neon dairy products
until you can't find them.

09:57.847 --> 10:02.644
And you are going to want
to take this caffeine pill--

10:02.686 --> 10:04.145
hold, please, thank you...
- Okay.

10:04.187 --> 10:07.982
- In exactly 1 minute and
40 seconds to avoid jet lag.

10:08.024 --> 10:10.318
I'll set my watch.
- That is so thoughtful.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.237
And honestly, perfect combo.

10:12.278 --> 10:13.863
I can't take a pill
unless I put it in a...

10:13.905 --> 10:15.407
both:
Slice of cheese like a dog.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.741
- Me too. What?
- Me too. What?

10:18.576 --> 10:19.661
- Okay!

10:19.703 --> 10:20.954
Now that you're here,

10:20.995 --> 10:23.998
I can share
my very exciting plan for you.

10:24.040 --> 10:28.336
In two months, I'm gonna get
you booked on--wait for it--

10:28.378 --> 10:30.588
The German Unity Day concert!

10:30.630 --> 10:32.298
[imitates fireworks]

10:32.340 --> 10:33.591
- Whoa!

10:34.592 --> 10:36.344
What's German Unity Day?

10:36.386 --> 10:39.222
- German Unity Day is
a huge concert every October

10:39.264 --> 10:40.682
commemorating
the fall of the Wall.

10:40.724 --> 10:42.100
It's like the Fourth of July

10:42.142 --> 10:43.977
meets
the Super Bowl Halftime Show,

10:44.019 --> 10:46.563
except that we are way cooler
about showing nipples here.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.939
- There's always
one spot reserved

10:47.981 --> 10:49.524
for the hottest new artist.

10:49.566 --> 10:51.151
It's basically
a popularity contest,

10:51.192 --> 10:54.362
so we will build up your
exposure and get you that spot.

10:54.404 --> 10:55.530
And guess what.

10:55.572 --> 10:57.574
You've already booked
your first show!

10:58.825 --> 11:00.326
How do you feel
about performing your mashup

11:00.368 --> 11:02.620
at a festival tomorrow?

11:02.662 --> 11:04.205
- Tomorrow?

11:04.247 --> 11:07.917
Wow, I didn't realize
it was happening that fast.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.378
I haven't sang by myself
in a while.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.964
- I would not have booked this
if you couldn't do it.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.301
Now, why don't we get you moved
into your new accommodations?

11:16.343 --> 11:19.012
[sentimental music]

11:19.054 --> 11:21.389
- I just want
to thank you so much--

11:21.431 --> 11:23.475
both of you.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.478
Two days ago, I was a nobody,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.104
and now I'm a celebrity

11:28.146 --> 11:31.691
with my own concert tomorrow...

11:31.733 --> 11:35.028
[mumbles incoherently]

11:35.070 --> 11:37.739
in Germany...
[watch beeps]

11:37.781 --> 11:39.282
- Oh, God!
Time for the pill!

11:39.324 --> 11:40.867
[hopeful music]

11:40.909 --> 11:43.328
- You know, I've been close
to stardom before, but...

11:43.370 --> 11:45.497
now it's actually happening.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.708
It feels like a dream,
and, like, a good one too--

11:48.750 --> 11:50.960
not like the one where
I'm in my childhood room

11:51.002 --> 11:53.838
and my mom is sittin'
on the corner of my bed,

11:53.880 --> 11:56.925
and she's holding her teeth
in her hand, asking,

11:56.966 --> 12:01.262
"Bumpy, what do I do?"

12:01.304 --> 12:02.764
I'm like, "I don't know."

12:02.806 --> 12:03.973
* *

12:04.015 --> 12:05.767
- Mmm.
How do you like the doner?

12:05.809 --> 12:07.102
- What kind of meat is this?

12:07.143 --> 12:08.603
- Oh, it is made
with dead animals.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.480
- Mmm, yeah. Meat!
- Yeah.

12:10.522 --> 12:11.481
both: Yeah.
- Oh, wow.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.775
[speaks German]

12:13.817 --> 12:14.776
- [speaks German]

12:14.818 --> 12:17.112
[laughter]
- Boom!

12:17.153 --> 12:18.780
[camera shutter clicks]
- Nice to see ya!

12:18.822 --> 12:20.198
- Did I just get recognized?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.200
- Oh, yes.
They are huge fans.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.619
- I should get photos,
send it to my ex, Amy.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.995
- Oh, how's Amy?

12:26.037 --> 12:27.956
- I wouldn't know.
She blocked me years ago.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.958
[laughs]
That is so awesome.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.960
- So we are almost
at your hostel.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.170
- Okay, in English, I think
it's actually pronounced

12:34.212 --> 12:35.797
"five-star hotel."

12:35.839 --> 12:37.632
Simple mistake.
- Oh, sorry.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.009
But our English is perfect.

12:39.050 --> 12:41.469
Germans speak English
far better than Americans.

12:41.511 --> 12:43.847
- [laughs]
No, they doesn't.

12:44.806 --> 12:47.475
- Und here we are!

12:47.517 --> 12:49.060
[sighs]

12:49.102 --> 12:50.603
- Ah...

12:50.645 --> 12:52.647
rustic.
- Yes.

12:52.689 --> 12:54.524
- So rustic.
- After you.

12:55.150 --> 12:57.569
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.279
- VoilÃ !

12:59.320 --> 13:01.322
Welcome home!

13:01.364 --> 13:03.324
[gong rings]

13:03.366 --> 13:05.994
- You must be Mr. Bumper.

13:06.036 --> 13:08.788
I'm Ursula Beckmann,
and I'm the matron here.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.373
I truly am meeting you.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.334
- Nice to meet you too.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.336
Oh, you didn't say,
"Nice to meet you."

13:14.377 --> 13:16.421
- Well, I don't know
if it's nice to meet you yet.

13:16.463 --> 13:19.049
We Germans are very precise
with our language.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.843
You may end up being the death
of me or my greatest treasure.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.012
We shall see.
- Okay.

13:24.054 --> 13:27.182
[jazz music playing]

13:27.223 --> 13:28.308
* *

13:28.350 --> 13:30.852
- Okay, and this is
where I'm staying?

13:30.894 --> 13:33.438
Oh.
- You will be inspired here!

13:33.480 --> 13:35.857
Much better
than a five-star hotel.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.192
- Is it?
- Yes.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.985
Now, I've got
some managing to do,

13:39.027 --> 13:40.320
but you get some rest.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.572
We need you fresh
for your show tomorrow.

13:42.614 --> 13:44.240
- Oh, no.
I am not tired.

13:44.282 --> 13:47.285
I got too much energy.
Let's go do something.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.704
- Okay.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.456
- I'll get nervous
if I'm alone.

13:51.498 --> 13:54.959
- Oh, um, it's just
boring business stuff.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.754
I'm meeting with a DJ
who wants to produce you.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.422
You'll need original music
eventually

13:59.464 --> 14:00.799
to get booked on Unity Day,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.842
but you don't want
to see how the sausage is made.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.720
- Uh...I'm in Germany.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.430
That's exactly what I wanna do.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.099
- Yeah,
and while you guys are gone,

14:09.140 --> 14:11.476
I'm gonna do a little bit
of shopping for Bumper.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.770
He seems to have brought
an odd number of socks,

14:13.812 --> 14:15.230
and his only dress shirt has

14:15.271 --> 14:16.898
all the Looney Tunes
rappelling from the collar.

14:16.940 --> 14:17.941
- That little Taz.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.317
Tweety's cool too.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.236
Let's go.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.987
- Okay.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.864
[indistinct chatter]

14:24.906 --> 14:27.826
[thumping techno music]

14:27.867 --> 14:35.000
* *

14:41.423 --> 14:43.341
This is just so cool!

14:43.383 --> 14:48.221
I can't believe you guys party
like this in the afternoon.

14:48.263 --> 14:50.807
Ah, I'm so jet-lagged, I don't
even know what time it is.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.434
It's, like--like, 5:00?

14:52.475 --> 14:56.021
- Actually, yes, but the other
5:00, and it's tomorrow!

14:56.062 --> 14:56.980
- * Malignant *

14:57.022 --> 15:03.820
* *

15:03.862 --> 15:06.239
- Now, enjoy yourself
and dance!

15:06.281 --> 15:07.323
- Okay!

15:07.365 --> 15:08.533
- DJ Das Boot!

15:08.575 --> 15:12.787

15:12.829 --> 15:15.623
[flute plays]

15:15.665 --> 15:16.916
Whoo!

15:16.958 --> 15:19.085
DJ Das Boot!

15:19.127 --> 15:22.130
D-D-D-D-DJ Das Boot!
- [sighs]

15:22.172 --> 15:25.675
- Yeah, I brought you
this amazing American talent

15:25.717 --> 15:27.927
to collaborate with!

15:27.969 --> 15:30.096
[speaks German]

15:30.138 --> 15:32.265
Don't be like that.

15:32.307 --> 15:34.392
- Dude, we don't have to beg,
okay?

15:34.434 --> 15:36.061
Let's just not work
with this butthead.

15:36.102 --> 15:38.021
- No, we are working
with this butthead. Come on.

15:38.063 --> 15:39.939
Das Boot is our ticket
to Unity Day.

15:39.981 --> 15:46.571
* *

15:46.613 --> 15:47.739
- * Malignant *

15:47.781 --> 15:49.741
- Thea, this is Bumper.

15:49.783 --> 15:53.370
Bumper,
this is my sister, Thea.

15:53.411 --> 15:54.621
- Your sister?

15:54.662 --> 15:55.997
I'm sorry, you guys
are brother and sister?

15:56.039 --> 15:56.998
- Yes, we're related.
- Why do you

15:57.040 --> 15:58.458
look like that then?
- What?

15:58.500 --> 16:00.335
- Nice to meet you.
My name is Bumper.

16:00.377 --> 16:02.671
You might recognize me
from such viral hits

16:02.712 --> 16:04.464
as "'99 Luftballons' Mashup,"

16:04.506 --> 16:07.300
and "Local Man Slips on Ice
and Penis Falls Out."

16:07.342 --> 16:09.803
- You have
a backpfeifengesicht.

16:09.844 --> 16:12.138
A face that is
deserving of a slap.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.350
- Yo, I actually get that--
I get that a lot.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.978
It's my round cheeks coupled
with my whole personality.

16:19.020 --> 16:22.524
- Bumper is the next superstar,
and you are always looking

16:22.565 --> 16:25.026
for that fresh, new sound
to produce.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.487
And besides, wouldn't it
be fun to work together?

16:27.529 --> 16:30.156
You're so busy!
We never get to hang out.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.075
We could be like
the Pointer Sisters.

16:32.117 --> 16:34.661
[gasps]
Or the Menendez brothers!

16:34.703 --> 16:36.121
Lyle, Erik.

16:36.162 --> 16:37.205
- And I'm Cousin Tony.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.415
I'm like,
"No, don't kill 'em, no!"

16:38.456 --> 16:40.333
- "Oh, too late!"
[both laugh]

16:40.375 --> 16:41.710
- Okay, shut up.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.003
I have a brand to uphold,

16:43.044 --> 16:45.672
and he doesn't seem up
to my musical standards.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.049
- Yeah, right.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.552
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hello?

16:50.593 --> 16:54.014
Hi, I got one thing
to say to you!

16:54.055 --> 16:57.684
[techno music fades]

16:57.726 --> 16:59.310
* Turn around *

16:59.352 --> 17:02.272
* Every now and then,
I get a little bit lonely *

17:02.313 --> 17:05.608
* And you're
never comin' 'round *

17:05.650 --> 17:07.318
See? You're impressed.

17:07.360 --> 17:10.488
You didn't realize that
I have a face of an angel,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.867
and also--
* The voice of an angel *

17:13.908 --> 17:15.827
That's the double angel, y'all.

17:15.869 --> 17:17.370
- Good for you, little boy.

17:17.412 --> 17:19.456
- Aw, man.
Thea, come to work!

17:19.497 --> 17:20.582
- [slurps]

17:20.623 --> 17:22.709
[gags]

17:22.751 --> 17:25.754
There's a cigarette butt.
How is that even possible?

17:25.795 --> 17:26.755
[toilet flushes]

17:26.796 --> 17:29.382
- Thea, please.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.217
Don't make a decision
until you see him perform

17:31.259 --> 17:33.011
at Pretzel Fest tomorrow.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.180
You know Unity Day
is a popularity contest.

17:35.221 --> 17:36.514
We need your clout.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.266
You can't turn
your back on family.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.060
We have the same back!

17:40.101 --> 17:41.227
- I'm sorry, Pieter.

17:41.269 --> 17:42.812
I know no one
will work with you,

17:42.854 --> 17:46.232
but I can't give up my artistic
integrity, even for family.

17:46.274 --> 17:49.235
But yeah, let's totally
have dinner next week.

17:49.277 --> 17:51.821
It's been too long.

17:51.863 --> 17:54.199
I'm available after 2:00 a.m.

17:58.828 --> 18:00.455
- Okay, dude.
What gives?

18:00.497 --> 18:03.249
Ever since I arrived,
things have been a little off,

18:03.291 --> 18:06.836
and your cool sister says
that no one will work with you?

18:06.878 --> 18:08.380
What the hell is going on?

18:08.421 --> 18:09.923
- [sighs] You don't
want to hear about it.

18:09.964 --> 18:12.592
It's so juicy.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.054
Okay.
[sighs]

18:16.096 --> 18:18.431
DSM had a public scandal
last year,

18:18.473 --> 18:21.476
and we are
an absolute disgrace.

18:21.518 --> 18:24.437
Dat Sound Machine is Germany's
second greatest shame.

18:24.479 --> 18:26.773
- What's Germany's
first greatest sh--

18:26.815 --> 18:28.066
oh, yep.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.485
- It all started
when our beatboxer's mouth

18:30.527 --> 18:33.154
became riddled with herpes
after a biological attack

18:33.196 --> 18:34.656
from a rival
a cappella group--

18:34.698 --> 18:37.784
we suspect it was the
Dutch team, Holland Oates--

18:37.826 --> 18:40.245
which rendered him useless.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.288
I set up a sound effect board
offstage

18:42.330 --> 18:45.792
for him to lip-synch to--

18:45.834 --> 18:48.378
an actual das Sound Machine.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.131
I was madly in love
with my girlfriend, Gisela,

18:51.172 --> 18:53.758
my DSM co-captain.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.594
I wanted to make sure
we'd win at all costs,

18:56.636 --> 18:58.930
but we were found out
and disgraced.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.640
No loops!

19:00.682 --> 19:02.183
The sound machine
malfunctioned

19:02.225 --> 19:04.686
and kept playing
after we stopped.

19:04.728 --> 19:06.521
Gisela dumped me,
the group dissolved,

19:06.563 --> 19:08.857
and I was blacklisted
as a singer.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.401
They took away my
throat steamer and my badge.

19:11.443 --> 19:12.861
Without the ability to sing,

19:12.902 --> 19:15.447
I tried to shift my career
to music management,

19:15.488 --> 19:18.366
but no one would work with me
except for Heidi.

19:18.408 --> 19:20.702
She sees the good
in everybody.

19:20.744 --> 19:23.204
[toilet flushes]

19:23.246 --> 19:26.875
- You broke the cardinal rule
of a cappella.

19:26.916 --> 19:29.294
If you use an instrument,

19:29.336 --> 19:31.880
that's just cappella!

19:31.921 --> 19:33.256
- I accept your disgust.

19:33.298 --> 19:34.758
A former singer
and an outcast.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.761
Just call me Pariah Carey!

19:37.802 --> 19:39.346
- No.

19:39.387 --> 19:40.847
I'm gonna call me
a new manager.

19:40.889 --> 19:43.308
- Actually,
I don't know that you will.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.394
- Pfft.
- You are viral on TikTok.

19:46.436 --> 19:50.398
But I may have exaggerated
slightly how famous you are.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.400
Nobody remembers
who sang that TikTok,

19:52.442 --> 19:55.195
and plenty of other people
have gone viral since.

19:55.236 --> 19:56.905
- You lied to me?

19:56.946 --> 19:59.366
Did those random Germans in
the street even recognize me?

19:59.407 --> 20:00.950
- Yeah, no, no.
Yes, they did.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.453
But it was from
your penis falling out video,

20:03.495 --> 20:04.913
not from your TikTok.

20:04.954 --> 20:07.707
- [laughs]

20:07.749 --> 20:09.125
Oh, my God.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.586
I'm the same failure
I was a week ago,

20:11.628 --> 20:14.422
except now, I'm stuck
in a foreign country

20:14.464 --> 20:16.591
without friends,
without a passport--

20:16.633 --> 20:18.426
- Really?
- Because I threw it away.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.594
I thought
it was a one-use thing.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.721
- That's
a valuable legal document.

20:21.763 --> 20:24.641
- I thought it was like
a napkin or a receipt.

20:26.935 --> 20:28.061
None of this is real.

20:28.103 --> 20:30.063
- The plan is real.

20:30.105 --> 20:33.483
You're not a star yet,
but you will be.

20:33.525 --> 20:36.528
I was always going
to come clean eventually,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.154
and I didn't mean to hurt you.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.323
- Well, you did.
- I'm sorry.

20:40.365 --> 20:44.160
I'm desperate,
and I really believe in you.

20:46.162 --> 20:48.832
- I've been disappointed a lot

20:48.873 --> 20:50.208
by friends,

20:50.250 --> 20:51.543
unfrosted cereal,

20:51.584 --> 20:54.337
the color of my own peepee.

20:55.547 --> 20:57.382
But this is the first time
I was let down

20:57.424 --> 20:58.925
by a random German man.

you'd be the first outta here.

[panting]

21:29.456 --> 21:32.208
Oh, God.
How long was I out for?

21:32.250 --> 21:35.920
- 30 seconds, but your screams
were very concentrated.

21:35.962 --> 21:38.006
Tell me, were you
playing a game of chess

21:38.048 --> 21:40.842
against Death itself?

21:40.884 --> 21:42.635
- No...

21:42.677 --> 21:47.766
Ursula, I thought
I had exactly what I wanted,

21:47.807 --> 21:51.353
but I am right back
to where I began:

21:51.394 --> 21:53.271
an adult loser.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.648
- If it's any consolation
to you,

21:55.690 --> 21:58.943
you're going to die someday.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.237
- I don't know
that it is, Ursula!

22:01.279 --> 22:02.822
I'm sorry.

22:02.864 --> 22:06.117
No offense, but I think
I need to talk to somebody

22:06.159 --> 22:08.995
who's 70% less German than you.

22:09.037 --> 22:10.497
You get it?

23:49.637 --> 23:52.724
Sorry, should I say
Karen Fraren?

23:52.766 --> 23:55.101
- Erm, no,
that was barely adequate.

23:55.143 --> 23:57.312
I am not ready
to play it for anyone yet.

23:57.354 --> 23:59.314
I perform under Karen Fraren

23:59.356 --> 24:01.816
so that I can get honest
feedback on my songwriting,

24:01.858 --> 24:04.402
but it is
my little secret, so...

24:04.444 --> 24:07.197
- Oh, well, that is hilarious.

24:07.238 --> 24:10.909
All I've ever wanted was
to be famous, on stage,

24:10.950 --> 24:12.410
performing
for millions of people

24:12.452 --> 24:14.537

24:14.579 --> 24:16.956
"Tim Allen!
Tim Allen!"

24:16.998 --> 24:18.792
- Yeah, well, you never
get a second chance

24:18.833 --> 24:20.627
to make a first impression,

24:20.669 --> 24:22.921
and if I am not perfect
when I step out as Heidi,

24:22.962 --> 24:24.839
I will just be
another American army brat

24:24.881 --> 24:26.633
who stayed in Germany
to go to music school,

24:26.675 --> 24:29.177
who never made it--
tale as old as time.

24:29.219 --> 24:33.348
- And this is
just one guy's opinion,

24:33.390 --> 24:34.933
but I thought Karen Fraren

24:34.974 --> 24:36.935
was one of the best singers
I've ever heard,

24:36.976 --> 24:39.896
and I've seen
Pentatonix live...

24:39.938 --> 24:42.649
before they kicked me out for
trying to climb on the stage.

24:42.691 --> 24:45.443

24:45.485 --> 24:47.946
but in your text,
you seemed pretty upset.

24:47.987 --> 24:50.448
What's going on?

24:50.490 --> 24:51.616
- It's nothing.

24:51.658 --> 24:54.160
It's just Pieter lied to me,

24:54.202 --> 24:56.955
and I found out
that I'm not famous

24:56.996 --> 24:58.790
outside of one stupid TikTok,
and--

24:58.832 --> 25:01.960

to get the sense

25:02.002 --> 25:03.503
that you didn't know
the whole story.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.088
- Yeah.
- But I know Pieter.

25:05.130 --> 25:07.590
I kept working for him
after the DSM scandal

25:07.632 --> 25:10.510
because his heart
is in the right place.

was gonna change everything.

Bumper kill for the chance

25:29.612 --> 25:33.616
to sing on stage
in front of an audience?

25:33.658 --> 25:34.868
- Yeah.

25:37.328 --> 25:40.582
If I do this,
I have to start from scratch.

25:40.623 --> 25:43.335
- If you're starting
from scratch,

25:43.376 --> 25:46.504

if you would show up today.

from the club at 3:00 a.m.

for you, okay?

right after this.

Oh, how wonderful!

there's just one opener,

and then you'll go on
and crush it.

I just, I--I guess
with all the lying and stuff,

27:20.974 --> 27:24.769
I totally forgot that
I'm actually very, very nervous

27:24.811 --> 27:26.688
