00:01.067 --> 00:03.370
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:01.067 --> 00:03.370
Officer Luca?

00:03.436 --> 00:05.338
Yeah?

00:03.436 --> 00:05.338
I'm your sister.

00:05.405 --> 00:06.172
It's not news to me, man.

00:06.239 --> 00:08.174
I've known about her
for three years.

00:08.241 --> 00:09.242
I don't know
if she was there

00:09.309 --> 00:10.643
for an apology,

00:10.710 --> 00:11.711
or that she
wanted money...

00:11.778 --> 00:12.779
Okay, this was a mistake.

00:12.846 --> 00:14.347
Sorry I ever reached out.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.750
Wait. Durant. Eva.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.750
Bye. Thanks.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.151
My partner Gabe

00:18.218 --> 00:19.419
was still up there

00:19.486 --> 00:20.754
when the whole
cliff face gave way.

00:20.820 --> 00:22.589
Climber died, Gabe
might as well have.

00:22.655 --> 00:26.192
Spinal cord injury.
Lives in a hospital now.

00:26.259 --> 00:27.694
Hondo, if I can't be objective,

00:27.761 --> 00:29.229
I'm not gonna
be able to do the job.

00:29.295 --> 00:30.296
I disagree.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.098
I've seen the line you walk.

00:32.165 --> 00:33.333
It's not easy,

00:33.400 --> 00:34.701
and I know
the toll it takes on you.

00:34.768 --> 00:37.804
Trust yourself...
like I trust you.

00:40.807 --> 00:43.109
Ginger tea, couple drops
of honey, just how you like it.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.045
Thanks to this one,
I'm gonna have to

00:46.112 --> 00:48.281
struggle through without
a helping hand from caffeine.

00:48.348 --> 00:49.716
Baby, you got up with the sun.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.785
Doesn't the inspector
general know that my baby

00:51.851 --> 00:53.386
needs some
beauty sleep?

00:53.453 --> 00:55.588
I just want to make sure
I'm not missing anything.

00:55.655 --> 00:57.357
Today is my first
use of force investigation.

00:57.424 --> 00:59.559
You seem a little anxious
about all this.

00:59.626 --> 01:01.361
Nichelle, I told you,

01:01.428 --> 01:03.596
OIG investigates
officer-related shootings

01:03.663 --> 01:05.131
all the time.

01:05.198 --> 01:06.533
The majority
are open and shut.

01:05.198 --> 01:06.533
I know,

01:06.599 --> 01:08.401
it's just a couple
members on the panel

01:08.468 --> 01:10.537
still see me
as a cop's girlfriend.

01:10.603 --> 01:11.638
I'm afraid they'll
think I'm biased

01:11.704 --> 01:13.473
if I rule in the
officer's favor.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.143
All you got to do
is look at the facts.

01:17.210 --> 01:19.646
You make your decision
based on those.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.314
Then all they can
accuse you of

01:21.381 --> 01:23.349
is doing your job.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.585
And if I rule
against the officer,

01:25.652 --> 01:26.786
would you be upset?

01:26.853 --> 01:29.222
No, of course not.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.624
Whatever call
you make...

01:33.393 --> 01:34.828
I know you're gonna
make the right one.

01:34.894 --> 01:36.162
(sighs)

01:36.229 --> 01:38.832
I appreciate that.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.366
I'll be in your
neighborhood today.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.534
If I get
a chance

01:41.601 --> 01:43.136
I'll stop by HQ and say hi.

01:43.203 --> 01:44.704
Mmm, something
to look forward to.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.406
Bye.

01:49.576 --> 01:51.878
Hey, my name is Rich,
and I'm an addict.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.546
Hi, Rich.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.782
Uh, started out with pills
here and there,

01:55.849 --> 01:59.385
but once I stuck that needle in,
it was game over.

02:00.520 --> 02:01.788
My life was
in free-fall.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.556
It just felt
too good, you know?

02:03.623 --> 02:05.492
It got so bad,
at one time

02:05.558 --> 02:08.194
I needed a hit,
couldn't wait,

02:08.261 --> 02:10.597
so I pull over,
shoot up, pass out.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.765
My three-year-old
daughter's in the backseat.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.668
Next thing I know,
cops are banging on the windows.

02:15.735 --> 02:16.769
She's been screaming
her head off

02:16.836 --> 02:18.404
the last couple hours.

02:18.471 --> 02:22.742
Still, all I can think
about is my next high.

02:24.277 --> 02:26.312
But that's not where
your story ends,

02:26.379 --> 02:27.547
is it?

02:27.614 --> 02:30.583
RICH:
No. I came back
down to Earth,

02:30.650 --> 02:32.619
I realized I needed help.
Decided to go to rehab.

02:32.685 --> 02:34.254
(man panting)

02:34.320 --> 02:35.755
Lila, come on.

02:35.822 --> 02:37.323
We're gonna
be late.

02:37.390 --> 02:39.325
Your brothers are
already in the car.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.493
Come on.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.262
All right.

02:42.328 --> 02:43.863
Where's your cleats?
You got soccer today.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.232
I don't need them.
I quit the team.

02:46.299 --> 02:47.700
I didn't say you could quit.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.235
Mom did.

02:49.302 --> 02:50.803
Hey. I might be
a little late tonight.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.373
Got to stop by my professor's
office after class, okay?

02:53.439 --> 02:55.208
(clears throat)

02:55.275 --> 02:57.777
Um, yeah, did you tell
Lila she could quit soccer?

02:57.844 --> 02:59.612
Yeah, she didn't want to play.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.381
You didn't want to
discuss it with me?

03:01.447 --> 03:02.615
I didn't think
it was a big deal.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.850
It's not like she's gonna play

03:03.917 --> 03:05.451
for the U.S. Women's
Team, David.

03:05.518 --> 03:07.186
That's not the point.
She has games coming up.

03:07.253 --> 03:08.521
She's gonna leave
her team hanging.

03:08.588 --> 03:09.789
What about
the other kids?

03:09.856 --> 03:11.257
Well, I imagine the other kids

03:11.324 --> 03:12.792
want to play soccer.
Lila doesn't.

03:13.593 --> 03:16.229
Okay, I love you, sweetheart.
Have a great day at school.

03:16.296 --> 03:17.597
I'm sorry, I can't deal
with this right now.

03:17.664 --> 03:18.631
Uh, have a great
day at work, okay?

03:18.698 --> 03:20.433
Okay.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.433
Bye.

03:20.500 --> 03:21.534
Bye.

03:21.601 --> 03:22.702
(door opens, closes)

03:22.769 --> 03:24.237
Go grab your cleats.

03:24.304 --> 03:24.938
You're not letting
the other kids down.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.472
But Mom said...

03:26.539 --> 03:28.775
No buts. Kays don't
break commitments.

03:31.878 --> 03:33.446
You know better.

03:36.482 --> 03:38.251
It might not work
the first time.

03:38.318 --> 03:39.586
Don't get discouraged.

03:39.652 --> 03:41.754
Two, three,
even more stints in rehab

03:41.821 --> 03:43.556
is not uncommon,

03:43.623 --> 03:45.258
but hard work,
dedication,

03:45.325 --> 03:46.459
and the right
rehab center,

03:46.526 --> 03:49.262
uh, it can pay off.

03:49.329 --> 03:50.496
You're looking at
an example of...

03:50.563 --> 03:51.998
What a load of crap!

03:52.065 --> 03:54.400
Please, you'll get your
turn, sir. Why don't...

03:54.467 --> 03:55.735
You make me sick.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.971
Sitting there,
lying to everybody,

03:58.037 --> 04:00.974
pretending that you care.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.710
These aren't people to you.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.378
They're dollar signs.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.380
Hey, man...

04:07.447 --> 04:09.415
I don't know who you are but
I can tell you're in a lot of...

04:09.482 --> 04:11.351
(people gasping)

04:09.482 --> 04:11.351
You might not know me,

04:11.417 --> 04:12.685
but you knew my brother.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.020
He's dead now.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.989
They found him
lying in a gutter,

04:16.055 --> 04:17.590
needle still
in his arm.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.727
But I don't blame the drugs.

04:20.793 --> 04:21.861
I blame you.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.997
Among others.

04:24.063 --> 04:25.632
And I'm gonna make you all pay.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.534
Please, I got... I got kids.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.303
My brother was just a kid.

04:31.404 --> 04:32.939
(shouting, screaming)

04:34.440 --> 04:35.575
(gunshot)

04:42.882 --> 04:44.584
Call an ambulance!

04:44.651 --> 04:46.319
(indistinct radio chatter)

04:46.386 --> 04:47.854
She gonna be okay?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.822
Paramedics say
she'll make it.

04:49.889 --> 04:51.924
No hope for the other
victim, though.

04:51.991 --> 04:54.027
We got an ID on
the shooter yet?

04:54.093 --> 04:56.829
No. These meetings
are anonymous.

04:56.896 --> 04:58.297
But...

04:58.364 --> 05:00.933
the gunman's description
matches a suspect

05:01.000 --> 05:02.335
from a shooting
earlier this morning.

05:02.402 --> 05:03.636
Driver for a van service

05:03.703 --> 05:04.804
was shot in his vehicle

05:04.871 --> 05:06.506
while he was stopped
at a stoplight.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.875
You got two murders
in the span of a few hours.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.443
Any connection
between the victims?

05:08.941 --> 05:10.443
Nothing obvious,

05:10.510 --> 05:11.711
but we're just now
starting to look into it.

05:11.778 --> 05:12.979
What do we know about
the victim here?

05:13.046 --> 05:14.480
Rich Carter.

05:14.547 --> 05:15.982
He was in recovery himself.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.517
Showed up to the morning meeting
that helps everyone

05:17.583 --> 05:18.685
get through the day.

05:18.751 --> 05:19.852
Apparently, the shooter
was ranting

05:19.919 --> 05:22.555
about a brother
who died recently.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.558
He blamed Rich for his brother's
death, "among others."

05:25.625 --> 05:28.061
Said he was gonna
make them all pay.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.029
You think our shooter
could be on a rampage.

05:30.096 --> 05:31.497
Yeah, that's why I called SWAT.

05:31.564 --> 05:32.699
Worried he was just
getting started.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.701
Thanks for
your help, man.

05:38.638 --> 05:40.473
Hey, building owner's
sending over

05:40.540 --> 05:41.774
his security footage
from the parking lot.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.810
I just talked
to the meeting leader.

05:43.876 --> 05:46.012
He said he's seen a lot of
drug-fueled outbursts before,

05:46.079 --> 05:47.580
but this gunman

05:47.647 --> 05:49.115
didn't seem like
he was high when he was yelling.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.283
It was like he knew
what he was saying.

05:50.349 --> 05:51.551
So we got a clear-headed
killer out there, potentially

05:51.617 --> 05:53.619
going after anyone he thinks had
a hand in his brother's death.

05:53.686 --> 05:55.054
All right, we got
to ID this guy

05:55.121 --> 05:56.656
and figure out who else
could be on his hit list

05:56.723 --> 05:58.725
before this turns into
an even bigger massacre.

06:02.595 --> 06:04.564
♪ ♪

06:40.833 --> 06:42.668
Any luck ID'ing the gunman
from the security footage?

06:42.735 --> 06:44.670
Yeah, he wasn't
exactly camera shy.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.774
Facial recognition ID'd
him as Tim Spragg, 27.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.408
Address on his
license is out of date,

06:49.475 --> 06:50.443
but his dad lives
in Glendale.

06:50.510 --> 06:51.544
Younger brother
he mentioned

06:51.611 --> 06:52.745
is Adrian Spragg.

06:52.812 --> 06:54.547
Overdosed on
heroin a month ago.

06:54.614 --> 06:56.082
His body was found
in an alley.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.817
From his social media,
it seems Tim

06:57.884 --> 06:59.752
took Adrian's death pretty hard.
Heartbreaking to read.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.921
DEACON: Well, it confirms it was
the catalyst for this morning.

07:01.988 --> 07:03.923
We figure out how the slain
van driver ties in to all this?

07:03.990 --> 07:06.459
Haven't found the link
between the victims yet.

07:06.526 --> 07:08.728
All right, keep looking.
We find a connection,

07:08.795 --> 07:10.596
we might get a lock on
Tim Spragg's next target.

07:10.663 --> 07:11.731
We should get ahold of
both victims' financials,

07:11.798 --> 07:13.699
see if there's
anything in common.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.034
Already working on it.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.068
DEACON: I'll have their dad
brought in to HQ.

07:16.135 --> 07:17.136
He might be able to give us

07:17.203 --> 07:18.671
some intel on the shooter.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.543
Hey, Hondo.

07:23.609 --> 07:24.744
Hey, I got a favor to ask.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.512
Sure. What's up?

07:26.579 --> 07:28.714
I worked with this patrol cop
recently, Eva Durant.

07:28.781 --> 07:30.750
Right? She's awesome.
In my opinion,

07:30.817 --> 07:32.952
she's way above pounding
the streets as a beat cop.

07:33.019 --> 07:34.520
Well, we all got to
start somewhere, Luca.

07:34.587 --> 07:35.755
And being a patrol cop

07:35.822 --> 07:37.056
has its own
set of challenges.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.624
Yeah, I know, but, look,

07:38.691 --> 07:39.792
she's been in
the field 16 years.

07:39.859 --> 07:41.027
I looked up
her record.

07:41.093 --> 07:42.829
She gets stellar
performance reviews,

07:42.895 --> 07:44.597
but she's still working patrol.
It doesn't make sense.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.999
There's got to be
someone standing in her way.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.034
You know
how that is.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.202
(chuckles) Yeah, I sure do.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.903
What's the favor you need?

07:50.970 --> 07:52.939
I was hoping that you could
talk to her captain,

07:53.005 --> 07:54.207
find out what the
deal is, you know?

07:54.273 --> 07:55.675
Maybe put in
a good word.

07:55.741 --> 07:58.010
Whatever obstacles
are in her way,

07:58.077 --> 07:59.579
maybe they get
out of her way.

07:59.645 --> 08:01.080
I trust your judgment, Luca.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.615
If you say someone deserves it,

08:02.682 --> 08:03.749
then they must.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.749
Really?

08:03.816 --> 08:05.685
So you'll make the call?

08:05.751 --> 08:07.086
Listen, I'm not sure
I got the sway to magic her

08:07.153 --> 08:08.521
out of her patrol car
and off the streets,

08:08.588 --> 08:09.655
but I'll see what I can do.

08:09.722 --> 08:10.623
All right.

08:09.722 --> 08:10.623
No promises though.

08:10.690 --> 08:12.024
Appreciate it, man.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.793
(exhales)

08:13.860 --> 08:15.895
I still can't believe
any of this.

08:15.962 --> 08:17.663
Are you sure it was Tim?

08:17.730 --> 08:18.865
He was caught on
security footage,

08:18.931 --> 08:20.066
and eyewitnesses
confirmed

08:20.132 --> 08:21.667
he was this
morning's shooter.

08:23.002 --> 08:24.170
But why would he do this?

08:24.237 --> 08:26.038
We think Adrian's death

08:26.105 --> 08:27.640
is what set
Tim off.

08:27.707 --> 08:28.774
Seems he's
targeting people

08:28.841 --> 08:30.543
that he feels
are responsible.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.712
Oh.

08:32.778 --> 08:34.714
Now, we are
worried that Tim

08:34.780 --> 08:36.182
intends to hurt
more people.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.550
Is there
anyone else

08:37.617 --> 08:39.085
you think
he might target?

08:39.151 --> 08:40.620
Any idea where he
could be hiding out?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.788
Girlfriend's,
a bar he likes?

08:42.855 --> 08:45.124
No, nowhere.
The last time I saw Tim

08:45.191 --> 08:46.759
was at Adrian's
funeral.

08:46.826 --> 08:49.228
Adrian was so skinny,
swimming in that suit

08:49.295 --> 08:50.830
we had picked out.

08:51.931 --> 08:53.532
Tim got angry.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.136
Wanted to find one that fit him.

08:57.203 --> 08:58.771
He punched me in the face

08:58.838 --> 09:00.206
right there over the casket.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.874
And you haven't heard
anything from him since?

09:01.941 --> 09:05.544
No. You should look
for a 2009 Toyota Corolla.

09:05.611 --> 09:07.546
It was Adrian's,
and he gave it to Tim

09:07.613 --> 09:08.814
when he lost
his license.

09:08.881 --> 09:09.916
We'll put out a BOLO on it.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.183
Can you tell us about Adrian,

09:11.250 --> 09:12.885
his life, his addiction?

09:12.952 --> 09:14.320
It might help us figure out

09:14.387 --> 09:16.022
who else Tim blames.

09:16.088 --> 09:18.324
Well, I can tell you three words
that I hold responsible:

09:18.391 --> 09:20.192
"Take as needed."

09:20.259 --> 09:23.129
Adrian got hooked on painkillers

09:23.195 --> 09:25.097
after he blew his knee
playing basketball.

09:25.164 --> 09:26.132
And when the doctors
cut him off,

09:26.198 --> 09:28.100
he found his way to heroin.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.602
Do you remember
which doctor

09:29.669 --> 09:30.937
first prescribed him
the painkillers?

09:31.003 --> 09:32.271
I don't remember.

09:32.338 --> 09:33.673
He saw so many
between the injury,

09:33.739 --> 09:37.310
physical therapy, the addiction.

09:37.376 --> 09:39.679
They just all
blend together.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.981
What about rehab.
Did Adrian ever give that a try?

09:42.048 --> 09:44.150
There was a place,
uh, a recovery center

09:44.216 --> 09:46.118
that he went to
a few times.

09:46.185 --> 09:47.954
Thought he was making progress.

09:49.822 --> 09:52.692
That's before
I knew that hope was pointless.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.794
Do you remember the name
of the rehab place?

09:54.860 --> 09:56.829
I don't remember,
but it was in Malibu.

09:56.896 --> 09:58.264
Um...

09:58.331 --> 10:00.333
Not... not Sunset Vista.

10:00.399 --> 10:01.767
Vista, vista...

10:01.834 --> 10:02.768
Ocean Vista.

10:02.835 --> 10:04.704
That was it.

10:04.770 --> 10:05.738
Sounds like you did
everything you could

10:05.805 --> 10:06.739
to try and help Adrian.

10:06.806 --> 10:07.740
He was my boy.

10:07.807 --> 10:08.941
And I loved him more

10:09.008 --> 10:10.142
than anything in the world,

10:10.209 --> 10:11.610
and I still
let him down.

10:11.677 --> 10:13.012
I get what that feels like,

10:13.079 --> 10:14.280
thinking you've
let someone down.

10:15.915 --> 10:17.850
The guilt just eats at you.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.186
Maybe that's what
turned Tim into a killer.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.655
Blaming others
for Adrian's death

10:22.722 --> 10:24.991
is easier than
dealing with his own guilt.

10:30.162 --> 10:32.031
Hey, everything okay?
Thought you had class?

10:32.098 --> 10:33.699
Yeah, I did,

10:33.766 --> 10:34.834
but Lila's school called.
She sprained her ankle.

10:34.900 --> 10:35.868
Nurse thought
it might've been

10:35.935 --> 10:37.336
a break, so I rushed over.

10:37.403 --> 10:38.404
Wait, what happened?
Is she okay?

10:38.471 --> 10:39.905
No, she's fine.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.074
They sent her
to class on crutches,

10:42.141 --> 10:43.809
but she twisted her
ankle playing soccer.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.778
That's strange because I thought
she quit playing soccer.

10:45.845 --> 10:49.115
I told her that
she had to stay on the team.

10:49.181 --> 10:50.816
So you just overruled me?

10:50.883 --> 10:52.118
Well, how is that different
than you telling her

10:52.184 --> 10:53.085
she could quit
without consulting me?

10:54.220 --> 10:55.721
Annie, Lila made a
commitment to the team.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.323
She needs to learn
that that's important.

10:57.390 --> 10:58.991
Her word needs to
mean something.

10:59.058 --> 11:01.794
David, she's nine.
She's not on the SWAT team.

11:01.861 --> 11:04.397
Soccer's just an
excuse for kids

11:04.463 --> 11:06.832
to run around with each other
before eating orange slices.

11:06.899 --> 11:08.334
I mean, you didn't seem to care

11:08.401 --> 11:09.702
when she
quit volleyball last year.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.170
That was different.

11:11.237 --> 11:12.838
How?

11:12.905 --> 11:15.808
Look, it's just...
It's just a sprained ankle.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.343
Okay, we're supposed to
go to Pismo Beach this weekend.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.978
She was looking forward to it,

11:19.045 --> 11:21.414
and now she's gonna be
on crutches in the sand.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.982
That's right.

11:23.049 --> 11:24.383
Well, I'll make it up to her.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.052
We'll do something else
fun this weekend.

11:26.118 --> 11:27.319
Yeah, we'll see.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.321
Um, I got to get back

11:29.388 --> 11:30.823
and I got to take care of

11:30.890 --> 11:31.791
all this classwork
I've been missing.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.626
So...

11:31.857 --> 11:33.626
Yeah.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.135
Hey, Powell, hold up a sec.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.770
What was that
just now

11:44.837 --> 11:46.439
with Tim's dad, about you...

11:46.505 --> 11:48.274
you feeling like
you've let someone down?

11:49.341 --> 11:51.110
Remember Gabe, my old partner,

11:51.177 --> 11:52.378
the guy who
was paralyzed?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.213
During that botched
rescue, yeah.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.347
What Tim's dad said in there

11:55.414 --> 11:56.849
about not doing enough,

11:56.916 --> 11:58.284
it reminds me of Gabe.

11:59.785 --> 12:01.487
I wasn't there
for him when he needed me.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.489
I mean, you said
it was an accident.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.057
There's nothing
you could have done.

12:05.124 --> 12:06.492
I don't feel guilty
about the accident,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.961
but afterwards,
when he was in a dark place,

12:09.028 --> 12:11.230
I didn't show up for him.

12:13.099 --> 12:14.433
The one time
I went to visit him,

12:14.500 --> 12:17.269
I stood there looking at
the guy that I used to

12:17.336 --> 12:19.305
run half
marathons with.

12:19.371 --> 12:20.873
It was just too hard
to see him like that.

12:20.940 --> 12:21.874
I walked out.

12:21.941 --> 12:24.043
I never went back.

12:24.110 --> 12:26.345
If you two were
as close as you say,

12:26.412 --> 12:28.514
I think Gabe
would want to see you,

12:28.581 --> 12:29.815
no matter how long it's been.

12:29.882 --> 12:31.517
What would I even say?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.052
Rub it in his face

12:33.119 --> 12:34.954
that I made SWAT
while he's lying there

12:35.020 --> 12:37.223
for the rest of his life,
unable to feed himself?

12:39.291 --> 12:41.260
Be ashamed to show my face.

12:46.999 --> 12:49.301
Street, you talk to
the suspect's father?

12:49.368 --> 12:50.503
Yeah.

12:49.368 --> 12:50.503
Any leads on

12:50.569 --> 12:51.904
where Tim could
be headed next?

12:51.971 --> 12:52.938
We put a BOLO
out on his car,

12:53.005 --> 12:54.273
but nothing concrete.

12:54.340 --> 12:56.275
The father mentioned
Adrian attended rehab,

12:56.342 --> 12:58.344
a place called Ocean
Vista out in Malibu.

12:58.410 --> 13:00.279
I figure someone there's
got to have insight

13:00.346 --> 13:01.547
on Adrian's
back story.

13:01.614 --> 13:02.815
All right, well,
we got no other leads,

13:02.882 --> 13:03.883
and RHD's coming up empty too.

13:03.949 --> 13:04.917
We'll keep up
the search here.

13:04.984 --> 13:06.118
You grab Tan,

13:06.185 --> 13:07.286
pay a visit
to Ocean Vista,

13:07.353 --> 13:08.354
find out
what you can.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.354
Okay.

13:11.891 --> 13:13.926
♪ ♪

13:27.206 --> 13:28.440
When I think rehab center,

13:28.507 --> 13:31.477
I pictured dingy hallways
and padded rooms.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.012
This place is beautiful.

13:33.078 --> 13:34.914
No better place to get clean
than in paradise.

13:37.216 --> 13:39.418
I called around to recovery
groups across the city.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.487
More than a few of them
knew the victim, Rich Carter.

13:41.554 --> 13:43.389
Seems like he went to
a different meeting every day,

13:43.455 --> 13:44.857
sometimes more than one.

13:44.924 --> 13:45.958
Guy wasn't just
picking up

13:46.025 --> 13:47.159
recovery chips
at those meetings,

13:47.226 --> 13:48.494
he was there to
recruit new patients.

13:48.561 --> 13:49.862
What do you mean?
For who?

13:49.929 --> 13:51.263
Look at this.

13:51.330 --> 13:53.465
Finally found
what links our two victims.

13:53.532 --> 13:54.967
Rich Carter and
the slain van driver

13:55.034 --> 13:57.036
both received payments
from this place.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.938
Blue Ridge Industries.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.339
Has stakes in a bunch
of rehab centers.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.107
I'm running a search now
to find the full list.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.542
So Carter was going to
all these meetings

14:03.609 --> 14:04.977
pretending to be
in recovery,

14:05.044 --> 14:06.111
when, really,
he was just there

14:06.178 --> 14:07.179
to recruit
rehab patients?

14:07.246 --> 14:08.447
And I'm guessing
Tim's brother

14:08.514 --> 14:09.848
was one of the people
that Rich recruited.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.150
Explains how
they connect.

14:11.217 --> 14:12.484
Okay, and the van driver,

14:12.551 --> 14:13.619
he was probably
delivering the people

14:13.686 --> 14:15.187
that Rich recruited.
That's how

14:15.254 --> 14:16.522
he made the
hit list.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.522
Now, hold up.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.257
Ocean Vista
Recovery Center.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.325
What, you know it?

14:19.391 --> 14:20.526
That's where Adrian Spragg

14:20.593 --> 14:22.127
attended rehab
before he overdosed.

14:22.194 --> 14:23.295
Luca, get Street
and Tan on the phone.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.430
They're on their way.

14:24.496 --> 14:25.631
Tim could be
rolling up any minute.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.900
Okay.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.900
(line ringing)

14:29.134 --> 14:30.336
What's up, Luca?

14:32.271 --> 14:33.606
Hold up, hold up. Tan.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.444
Both victims from this morning
lead back to this place.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.079
Luca says Tim might
be targeting employees.

14:40.145 --> 14:41.380
All right, we'll be
on the lookout.

14:41.447 --> 14:43.315
That's Tim's car.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.618
Luca, Tim
beat us here.

14:45.684 --> 14:47.186
Send cover units.

14:52.324 --> 14:53.492
LAPD.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.060
You see a man
come through here?

14:55.127 --> 14:56.562
Six feet, white, brown hair?

14:58.130 --> 14:59.298
Go on. Go, go, go.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.298
(hushed chatter)

14:59.365 --> 15:01.967
(gunshots)

14:59.365 --> 15:01.967
(people screaming)

15:02.034 --> 15:03.502
25-David.
We have an active shooter.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.637
Ocean Vista
Recovery Center.

15:07.373 --> 15:08.374
Out this way, out this way.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.375
(gunshot)

15:09.441 --> 15:11.310
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

15:14.013 --> 15:15.114
Go, go, go!

15:15.180 --> 15:17.316
Out that way! Out the front!

15:17.383 --> 15:18.684
Out the front!

15:20.085 --> 15:21.587
Help! (groans)

15:22.187 --> 15:25.124
I'll try to stop the bleeding.
You go after Tim.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.525
Roger.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.527
(man groans)

15:26.592 --> 15:28.527
All right, hang on.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.695
You're gonna be all right.
Gonna be all right.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.695
Okay. All right.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.696
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!

15:30.763 --> 15:32.231
You, come here.

15:32.298 --> 15:33.399
I need your help.
Give me your hands.

15:33.465 --> 15:34.566
All right, keep
pressure on him.

15:34.633 --> 15:35.267
I'll call for
an ambulance.

15:38.704 --> 15:40.439
STREET:
Don't move!

15:38.704 --> 15:40.439
(gunshots)

15:54.653 --> 15:55.988
(horn honks)

15:54.653 --> 15:55.988
(tires screech)

15:57.256 --> 15:59.124
Stay in the car!

16:00.693 --> 16:02.227
Get out!

16:03.228 --> 16:04.330
Hey, stop!

16:06.598 --> 16:09.168
26-David. Suspect
carjacked a red Chrysler.

16:09.234 --> 16:11.036
Headed towards PCH.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.076
Okay, thank you.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.545
Street, unis found
the car Tim jacked

16:19.611 --> 16:21.447
a few miles from here.
He must've fled on foot.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.582
Air units are searching,
but no sign yet.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.184
I've been talking
to patients.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.286
Guy over there cycled
through here four times.

16:27.353 --> 16:28.687
As soon as his
insurance is used up,

16:28.754 --> 16:30.222
they find a way
to boot him out

16:30.289 --> 16:32.257
until his next relapse
resets his benefits.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.059
This whole thing's a racket,

16:34.126 --> 16:36.528
with off-the-books employees
feeding the conveyor belt.

16:36.595 --> 16:38.464
Turns out our dead van driver
had a record.

16:38.530 --> 16:41.033
Busted four times
for possession.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.469
Want to guess how guys like
Adrian continued to relapse?

16:43.535 --> 16:44.770
Yeah, it
makes sense

16:44.837 --> 16:46.271
Tim would blame
Ocean Vista.

16:46.338 --> 16:47.706
With so many
off-the-books employees,

16:47.773 --> 16:49.375
how do we know
who he'll go after next?

16:50.142 --> 16:51.777
Medics got the owner
of this place patched up.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.113
We can talk to him now.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.584
Who was that guy?

16:58.650 --> 17:00.619
Did you catch him?

17:00.686 --> 17:03.255
His name is Tim Spragg.
His brother was a patient here.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.257
Adrian.
You remember him?

17:05.324 --> 17:08.594
No. No, I don't,
but we help so many.

17:08.660 --> 17:10.529
He came through here a few times

17:10.596 --> 17:12.131
before he died last
month of an overdose.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.232
Well, I really wish
I could tell you

17:13.298 --> 17:14.266
that was
a unique story,

17:14.333 --> 17:15.634
but people just don't understand

17:15.701 --> 17:17.369
how much of a killer
addiction truly is.

17:17.436 --> 17:18.771
Yeah, well, right now
we're trying to stop

17:18.837 --> 17:20.506
even more people from dying.

17:20.572 --> 17:22.574
Adrian's brother Tim
has already killed two people

17:22.641 --> 17:24.309
connected to this center,

17:24.376 --> 17:25.411
so I'm gonna need a list

17:25.477 --> 17:27.045
of all your employees,

17:27.112 --> 17:28.347
including the under-the-table
people you pay

17:28.414 --> 17:29.681
to hook addicts
and bring them here.

17:29.748 --> 17:32.117
I-I have no idea
what you're talking about.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.721
Ocean Vista is 100% above board,

17:35.788 --> 17:37.356
dedicated to helping
those battling addiction.

17:37.423 --> 17:40.359
Only thing you're dedicated to
is making money.

17:40.426 --> 17:41.660
You cycle people
in and out of here,

17:41.727 --> 17:43.262
getting them addicted
all over again,

17:43.328 --> 17:45.097
all in the name of making bank.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.065
No, that's just not true.
Our mission is to save people.

17:47.132 --> 17:48.200
HONDO:
Is that so?

17:48.267 --> 17:49.368
Because we ran the numbers.

17:49.435 --> 17:51.403
Your relapse rates are higher

17:51.470 --> 17:52.638
than any other
center in the city,

17:52.704 --> 17:54.473
your number of fatalities,
almost double.

17:54.540 --> 17:55.474
Well, that's because
we don't cherry-pick

17:55.541 --> 17:57.342
the easy cases, Sergeant.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.811
The patients
that we have here

17:58.877 --> 18:00.479
are on the brink.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.815
These are people that other
centers turn away.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.450
Now, look,

18:04.516 --> 18:05.851
I-I know this might
look like a spa to you,

18:05.918 --> 18:08.387
but this is really an ER,
and the people

18:08.454 --> 18:09.555
that come here
are in

18:09.621 --> 18:11.390
real life-or-death
jeopardy.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.225
We do the very best that we can,
but we cannot save everyone,

18:13.292 --> 18:15.661
and unfortunately, that is
the nature of this business.

18:16.628 --> 18:18.163
People die.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.165
You gonna give me a list
of all your employees,

18:20.232 --> 18:22.100
or do you want their
deaths on your hands too?

18:27.406 --> 18:28.607
Tim was carrying
some papers

18:28.674 --> 18:30.509
when he ran out of here.
What did he take?

18:30.576 --> 18:32.444
Uh, his brother's
patient files.

18:32.511 --> 18:33.545
He made me
hand them over.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.214
You didn't think
to tell us that?

18:35.280 --> 18:37.483
Oh. I'm sorry, Officer,
I had just been shot.

18:37.549 --> 18:39.718
Forgive me if I don't
remember every little detail.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.354
What was in them?

18:39.785 --> 18:42.354
Mostly just
therapists' notes,

18:42.421 --> 18:43.755
I don't know, I'm not 100% sure.

18:43.822 --> 18:45.491
Privacy laws
prevent me from reading them.

18:45.557 --> 18:47.359
Then who is Adrian's therapist?

18:47.426 --> 18:48.861
They could be targeted.
Same for anyone else

18:48.927 --> 18:50.729
mentioned on that file.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.297
Tim could be going after them
right now. Now, who was he?

18:52.364 --> 18:53.298
He worked primarily
with a therapist

18:53.365 --> 18:54.800
named Christine Thomson,

18:54.867 --> 18:56.268
but, unfortunately,
she no longer works with us.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.769
Where is she?

18:56.335 --> 18:57.769
I have no idea.

18:57.836 --> 18:59.404
We didn't keep in touch,
but I imagine

18:59.471 --> 19:00.606
she's in
private practice somewhere.

19:00.672 --> 19:02.241
Tan, let's go.

19:04.343 --> 19:05.477
Tim might be
the one

19:05.544 --> 19:07.179
out there shooting people,

19:07.246 --> 19:08.847
but this all falls back
on you and this center.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.582
Don't think we don't know that.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.292
Hey.

19:20.359 --> 19:21.660
You looking
for Hondo?

19:21.727 --> 19:24.696
Hey. Yeah, I can't
seem to find him, though.

19:24.763 --> 19:26.331
Last I heard, he was
heading back from Malibu.

19:26.398 --> 19:27.666
Should be back soon.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.902
Ah, it's not important.
I was just dropping by

19:29.968 --> 19:31.537
before an OIG meeting.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.705
How are you?
How are Annie and the kids?

19:33.772 --> 19:34.806
Good.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.175
Mostly good.

19:37.242 --> 19:39.545
Mostly? What's going on?

19:39.611 --> 19:41.346
It's nothing much. It's...

19:41.413 --> 19:43.448
silly, really, but, um,

19:43.515 --> 19:44.816
Lila's been playing soccer

19:44.883 --> 19:46.852
and she wanted to quit the team,

19:46.919 --> 19:48.654
but I made her keep playing,

19:48.720 --> 19:51.223
and now she sprained her ankle.

19:51.290 --> 19:52.824
So it's a whole situation.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.293
Oh, no. I hope she's okay.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.360
No, she's fine,
she's a tough kid.

19:55.427 --> 19:56.662
All I wanted

19:56.728 --> 19:57.796
was for her to
learn the same lessons

19:57.863 --> 20:00.465
I did as a kid playing sports.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.467
And some of the
things I learned

20:02.534 --> 20:03.802
being on a team,

20:03.869 --> 20:06.338
I still apply today.

20:06.405 --> 20:07.573
And on weekends,

20:07.639 --> 20:09.207
we'd kick the ball around,
you know.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.576
She seemed really into it,
and we had...

20:10.642 --> 20:12.511
we had fun.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.882
You know, my dad used to love

20:16.949 --> 20:18.317
watching my
spelling bee competitions.

20:18.383 --> 20:20.586
Spelling bee?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.586
Hmm.

20:20.652 --> 20:23.221
You're looking at the California
State sixth grade champion.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.656
Oh, wow.

20:24.723 --> 20:27.326
He had a front row seat to
every competition,

20:27.392 --> 20:30.395
spent hours poring over
word lists with me.

20:30.462 --> 20:33.966
I loved it. Until, one day,

20:34.032 --> 20:36.902
I tried a dance class,
and from then on,

20:36.969 --> 20:39.771
it was goodbye, dictionary,
hello, pointe shoes.

20:39.838 --> 20:42.007
(chuckles)
My dad would still

20:42.074 --> 20:43.875
come to my recitals,

20:43.942 --> 20:47.245
but I think he missed
the hours we spent

20:47.312 --> 20:49.881
learning how to spell
eight-syllable words.

20:50.882 --> 20:51.984
Hmm.

20:54.353 --> 20:56.521
Ah, my meeting
is about to start.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.290
It was good seeing you.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.425
I'll catch you later, Deacon.
Give my love to Annie.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.593
Will do.

21:00.492 --> 21:01.593
Okay.

21:02.728 --> 21:04.463
(door opens, closes)

21:06.732 --> 21:08.934
What the hell, Luca?

21:10.502 --> 21:12.270
I told you I didn't
want anything to do with you

21:12.337 --> 21:13.538
or your family.

21:12.337 --> 21:13.538
Whoa, whoa, hold up.
What's the problem?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.407
Your team leader
called my captain

21:15.474 --> 21:16.942
and asked why I hadn't
been promoted

21:17.009 --> 21:18.977
from patrol duty, and I know
you put him up to it.

21:19.044 --> 21:20.746
Yeah, I did.
I was just trying to help.

21:20.812 --> 21:22.481
Look, I read your file.

21:22.547 --> 21:23.915
I figured something was standing
in your way of moving up,

21:23.982 --> 21:24.983
and I thought
Hondo could maybe

21:25.050 --> 21:26.585
make something
happen for you.

21:26.652 --> 21:28.053
All right, well, next time,
keep your nose

21:28.120 --> 21:29.721
out of things you
know nothing about.

21:29.788 --> 21:31.923
I don't need
your help.

21:31.990 --> 21:33.792
You know,
and I don't know

21:33.859 --> 21:35.694
what kind of
opportunistic jerk

21:35.761 --> 21:37.295
you think I am,

21:37.362 --> 21:38.597
but I didn't reach out to you

21:38.664 --> 21:40.832
so I could
get ahead in the LAPD.

21:40.899 --> 21:42.634
Okay? I just wanted
to get to know

21:42.701 --> 21:43.935
my brother.

21:44.002 --> 21:45.704
And now I wish to God I hadn't.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.346
Luca.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.648
I just hear her
say "brother"?

21:56.715 --> 21:58.650
Something going on
I should know about?

21:58.717 --> 22:00.485
Eva's my half sister.

22:00.552 --> 22:03.889
I just found out recently.
It's a whole story.

22:03.955 --> 22:05.490
Yeah, one you should've told me

22:05.557 --> 22:06.425
before I put in
a good word for her, Luca.

22:06.491 --> 22:07.959
I know, I'm sorry.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.461
It's just, the whole thing
is complicated as hell.

22:09.528 --> 22:10.762
My dad doesn't even
know about her.

22:10.829 --> 22:13.732
And with three generations
of Lucas on SWAT,

22:13.799 --> 22:15.801
if this got out,
it'd be a whole big deal.

22:15.867 --> 22:17.636
I was just
trying to keep it quiet.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.771
I can't imagine what kind of
a surprise that was for you.

22:19.838 --> 22:20.939
What's going on?
She didn't seem

22:21.006 --> 22:22.040
too happy with you.

22:22.107 --> 22:23.608
Yeah, well, you know, Eva and I

22:23.675 --> 22:24.976
didn't get off to a great start,
so I thought

22:25.043 --> 22:26.578
if I could help her
move up in the LAPD,

22:26.645 --> 22:28.714
it would maybe
patch things up between us.

22:28.780 --> 22:29.848
I'm sorry

22:29.915 --> 22:31.349
I got you wrapped up
in it, Hondo.

22:31.416 --> 22:33.351
Well, listen,
for what it's worth,

22:33.418 --> 22:35.787
when I spoke to
her commander, he said that

22:35.854 --> 22:37.089
she is a star in
their department,

22:37.155 --> 22:38.990
and there is nobody
standing in her way.

22:39.057 --> 22:40.492
So I'm guessing
she's working patrol

22:40.559 --> 22:41.526
because that's the way
she wants it.

22:41.593 --> 22:42.794
Just trying to look out for her,

22:42.861 --> 22:44.596
that's all.

22:47.766 --> 22:50.035
Hey, I get it, man.

22:50.102 --> 22:51.670
Listen, when we were younger,

22:51.737 --> 22:54.072
my sister Winnie
had a waitressing job.

22:54.139 --> 22:55.907
She comes home
dead tired one night.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.910
Says the owner made her stay
late to work in the kitchen.

22:58.977 --> 23:01.713
Now, that didn't sit
right with me at all.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.448
Oh, no, I show up
to set this dude straight.

23:03.515 --> 23:06.118
I got all up in his face
in front of his entire staff.

23:06.184 --> 23:07.719
But it turns out Winnie
asked for the extra work.

23:07.786 --> 23:09.588
She wanted to be in the kitchen

23:09.654 --> 23:10.956
because she was
trying to learn the ropes.

23:11.022 --> 23:12.023
And, boy, did she read me

23:12.090 --> 23:13.158
the riot act.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.127
But she forgave you, right?

23:15.193 --> 23:16.995
After I apologized to this dude.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.531
But from then on, trust me,

23:19.598 --> 23:21.066
I made damn sure never to make

23:21.133 --> 23:22.634
any assumptions
about Winnie's business

23:22.701 --> 23:24.002
ever again.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.504
So you think I should
back off with Eva?

23:26.671 --> 23:28.140
I know it's hard, Luca,

23:28.206 --> 23:31.409
but, yeah, give her some space.

23:31.476 --> 23:32.878
You ain't gonna make up
for the last 40 years

23:32.944 --> 23:34.012
in just
a few months.

23:34.079 --> 23:35.881
Yeah, maybe you're right.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.116
Thank you.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.116
Yeah.

23:41.553 --> 23:43.121
Thanks for
coming in, Ms. Thomson.

23:43.188 --> 23:44.890
You were Adrian
Spragg's therapist

23:44.956 --> 23:46.858
at Ocean Vista,
correct?

23:44.956 --> 23:46.858
I was.

23:46.925 --> 23:49.127
His overdose is actually
the reason I quit working there.

23:49.194 --> 23:51.897
I thought I could
do some good,

23:51.963 --> 23:53.899
but it got demoralizing
to see the same faces

23:53.965 --> 23:56.067
over and over,
never getting any better.

23:56.134 --> 23:57.969
His death

23:58.036 --> 24:00.605
was the last straw.

23:58.036 --> 24:00.605
Not just for you,
it seems.

24:00.672 --> 24:02.040
Adrian's brother Tim
is killing people

24:02.107 --> 24:04.142
he holds responsible
for Adrian dying.

24:05.544 --> 24:07.546
Oh, my God. That's horrible.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.681
Did you know Tim Spragg?

24:09.748 --> 24:11.149
Only from what
Adrian told me.

24:11.216 --> 24:13.785
Adrian felt a lot of guilt
that his addiction

24:13.852 --> 24:15.587
was letting the family down

24:15.654 --> 24:17.222
after they did so
much to help him.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.591
Tim was actually the topic
of Adrian's affirmation video.

24:19.658 --> 24:20.725
Sorry.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.127
What's an affirmation video?

24:22.194 --> 24:23.862
It's a tool
I use with my patients.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.131
I have them talk about things
that matter to them.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.500
And then, when they
feel like relapsing,

24:28.567 --> 24:29.868
they watch the video
as a reminder

24:29.935 --> 24:31.570
of things worth
living for.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.004
Adrian mostly talked about Tim,

24:33.071 --> 24:34.673
how grateful he was,
how much he loved him.

24:34.739 --> 24:36.942
Tim stole Adrian's therapy files

24:37.008 --> 24:38.610
from Ocean Vista.

24:38.677 --> 24:39.845
Would that video
have been included?

24:39.911 --> 24:41.513
No, no. I keep those
on my phone.

24:41.580 --> 24:43.148
If a patient needs one,
they can text me,

24:43.215 --> 24:44.883
and I send it right over.

24:44.950 --> 24:46.585
What would Tim find
in the files he stole?

24:46.651 --> 24:47.853
Is there...
Is there anyone

24:47.919 --> 24:49.154
Adrian blamed
that's mentioned?

24:49.221 --> 24:50.589
It could help us

24:50.655 --> 24:52.090
narrow down who Tim
might go after next.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.759
Adrian mostly directed
the blame towards himself,

24:54.826 --> 24:56.795
but more than once,

24:56.862 --> 24:58.830
he mentioned his college
basketball coach.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.266
When Adrian was
first injured,

25:01.333 --> 25:02.801
it was his coach
who pushed him

25:02.868 --> 25:04.069
to keep using painkillers

25:04.135 --> 25:05.804
so he could play in the finals.

25:05.871 --> 25:08.206
Adrian saw that as
the root of his addiction.

25:08.273 --> 25:09.674
Do you remember
the coach's name?

25:09.741 --> 25:11.743
I don't, just that he coached

25:11.810 --> 25:12.811
Adrian in
basketball.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.145
Thank you.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.145
Thanks.

25:15.947 --> 25:17.549
Once Tim reads
that file,

25:17.616 --> 25:19.651
his brother's coach has
to be his next target.

25:19.718 --> 25:21.119
Adrian attended
North Hills University

25:21.186 --> 25:22.687
around 2015.

25:22.754 --> 25:24.055
Who was coaching then?

25:24.122 --> 25:25.657
(computer beeps)

25:25.724 --> 25:26.992
Ron Harley was
the men's basketball coach.

25:27.058 --> 25:29.227
He transferred to

25:29.294 --> 25:30.595
Desert Springs College
in Northridge.

25:30.662 --> 25:31.830
We need to get there
before Tim does.

25:36.134 --> 25:37.769
Obviously, Dean.

25:37.836 --> 25:39.838
I understand
the importance of academics,

25:39.905 --> 25:42.908
but I really need Barnes
on the court tonight.

25:51.650 --> 25:53.585
Do you want to win
a championship or not?

26:01.059 --> 26:02.794
Tim's got to be
after Coach Harley.

26:02.861 --> 26:03.762
Anyone who gets in the way
could be collateral damage.

26:03.828 --> 26:05.130
All right, thanks.

26:05.196 --> 26:06.631
Campus security is spread thin

26:06.698 --> 26:08.166
across the satellite campuses.

26:08.233 --> 26:09.901
They'll try to get a lockdown,
but with 2,000 students,

26:09.968 --> 26:11.303
it's gonna
take time.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.871
Coach still
isn't picking up.

26:11.369 --> 26:12.871
Two minutes out.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.873
Get us there in one, Luca.

26:12.938 --> 26:14.873
(engine revs)

26:14.940 --> 26:16.308
HARLEY:
Because without Barnes,

26:16.374 --> 26:17.609
we don't have a shot.

26:17.676 --> 26:19.611
(gun clicks)

26:17.676 --> 26:19.611
(people gasping)

26:19.678 --> 26:22.147
Whoa. My wallet's in my pocket.
Take whatever you want.

26:22.213 --> 26:23.181
TIM: You don't
remember me?

26:23.248 --> 26:25.583
I'm Adrian's brother.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.218
You remember him, at least?

26:27.285 --> 26:28.987
If not for you,
he'd still be alive.

26:29.054 --> 26:30.889
Look, I'm sorry, man.

26:30.956 --> 26:33.258
If I'd known Adrian was gonna
spin out like he did, I never

26:33.325 --> 26:35.193
would've pushed him
so hard. Please.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.193
He looked up to you,

26:35.260 --> 26:36.995
respected you!

26:37.062 --> 26:38.863
And all you cared about
was winning that stupid game.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.198
Not the players.

26:38.930 --> 26:40.198
No.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.167
(sirens chirping)

26:42.233 --> 26:44.035
Get on the bus.

26:42.233 --> 26:44.035
Please...

26:44.102 --> 26:45.103
Hurry! Go!

26:45.170 --> 26:46.705
Go!

26:48.073 --> 26:50.275
Shut the door.

26:50.342 --> 26:52.077
Get to the back,
all of you.

26:52.143 --> 26:53.645
Move.

26:53.712 --> 26:54.813
Hey, not you.
You stay up here with me.

26:54.879 --> 26:56.915
Start it up.
Get us out of here.

26:56.982 --> 26:57.916
20-David.

26:57.983 --> 26:59.250
Pin the bus in.

26:59.317 --> 27:00.318
You take the front,
we've got the six.

27:00.385 --> 27:01.219
DRIVER:
We're blocked!

27:09.761 --> 27:11.963
Luca, set up a sniper position.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.198
Deac and Tan,
you shut down that engine.

27:13.264 --> 27:14.666
Street, we need eyes.

27:14.733 --> 27:16.034
Powell, you stay with me.

27:16.101 --> 27:17.635
He's probably got
a dozen hostages in there.

27:17.702 --> 27:19.137
We got to get a grip
on this thing fast. Move.

27:23.775 --> 27:24.876
(rifle cocks)

27:24.943 --> 27:27.178
Pull the window shades down now.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.814
LUCA:
They're dropping
the shades, Hondo.

27:29.881 --> 27:31.116
Side windows are tinted.

27:31.182 --> 27:33.651
I can't get a visual
on the suspect.

27:35.420 --> 27:38.790
(engine idling)

27:38.857 --> 27:39.991
Seems a little more complicated

27:40.058 --> 27:41.259
than turning a key
in the ignition.

27:41.326 --> 27:43.194
Nah, just need to find
the kill switch.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.197
(engine stops)

27:48.033 --> 27:49.234
Did you do that?

27:49.300 --> 27:50.335
No, it wasn't me. I swear.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.003
(phone rings)

27:54.272 --> 27:55.440
Answer the call, Tim!

27:55.507 --> 27:56.775
Let's talk.

27:56.841 --> 27:58.877
(phone ringing)

28:01.446 --> 28:02.847
You don't want to mess with me.

28:02.914 --> 28:04.249
I only came here for the coach.

28:04.315 --> 28:06.017
Don't force me
to hurt anybody else.

28:06.084 --> 28:07.318
HONDO:
Okay, hey, hey, ease up,
all right?

28:07.385 --> 28:09.054
Best if we just start
by talking.

28:09.120 --> 28:11.356
My name is
Sergeant Harrelson, LAPD.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.258
Enough people
have already died today, Tim.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.060
So how about

28:15.126 --> 28:16.461
you put that gun down
and step out of the bus?

28:16.528 --> 28:18.430
Not a chance. I can't do that.

28:18.496 --> 28:19.931
Sure, you can,
we just got to figure out

28:19.998 --> 28:20.999
how to make that happen.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.200
Just got to work with me, Tim.

28:32.911 --> 28:35.180
I think I found an entry point
for the snake cam.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.315
You think I don't know what
you're trying to do?

28:37.382 --> 28:39.017
I'm not coming out,

28:39.084 --> 28:40.485
not till I do
what I came here to do.

28:40.552 --> 28:43.221
This guy's on the verge
of murder-suicide.

28:43.288 --> 28:45.023
If we don't get in there fast,
who knows how many more

28:45.090 --> 28:46.024
he's gonna take
down with him.

28:46.091 --> 28:47.258
Let me talk to him.

28:47.325 --> 28:48.359
I have an idea
what he's feeling.

28:48.426 --> 28:49.761
Maybe I can get through to him.

28:49.828 --> 28:50.929
Powell, we don't
have time for therapy.

28:50.995 --> 28:51.930
There're too many
lives at stake.

28:51.996 --> 28:53.364
Let me try.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.166
Look, as long as he's talking,
he's not killing.

28:57.268 --> 28:58.837
All right.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.472
Powell, you
keep him talking.

29:00.538 --> 29:01.973
Deac, you and I got to
figure out a breach

29:02.040 --> 29:03.308
to end all of this.

29:03.374 --> 29:04.409
Let's go.

29:07.278 --> 29:08.880
Tim, my name's Zoe.
I'm a cop, too.

29:08.947 --> 29:10.281
I was hoping we could talk.

29:10.348 --> 29:11.516
I don't want to talk.
Just let me finish this.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.251
We can't do that, Tim.

29:13.318 --> 29:15.453
I know about Adrian, though.

29:15.520 --> 29:17.222
I know he was
taken advantage of,

29:17.288 --> 29:18.890
but this isn't
the way to fix it.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.126
No matter who you kill,
it won't change anything.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.794
No one cared
about him except me.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.463
I need to do this for him.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.135
STREET:
Shooter's between
rows three and five,

29:30.201 --> 29:32.237
just pacing back and forth.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.439
Last three rows
are full of players.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.208
DEACON:
All right,
so a middle entry puts us

29:37.275 --> 29:38.776
between the shooter
and the players.

29:38.843 --> 29:39.844
What about the coach
and the driver?

29:39.911 --> 29:41.179
They're still up front.

29:41.246 --> 29:42.881
I still think
it's our best option.

29:42.947 --> 29:45.416
Adrian was used by people
who were more concerned

29:45.483 --> 29:47.952
about making money or winning
trophies than his wellbeing.

29:48.019 --> 29:50.121
I-I get that you feel like

29:50.188 --> 29:52.557
you didn't step up.
I know that feeling.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.492
Makes you want to crawl
out of your skin, right?

29:54.559 --> 29:56.528
I should've protected him.

29:56.594 --> 29:58.129
I'm his older brother.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.331
You did all you could.

30:00.398 --> 30:02.167
But if you're trying
to make amends,

30:02.233 --> 30:04.102
Tim, this is not the way
to go about it.

30:04.169 --> 30:06.437
I have a younger sister.

30:06.504 --> 30:07.972
Her name's Grace.

30:08.039 --> 30:09.107
Don't know what
I'd do if I lost her.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.875
She's my best friend.

30:10.942 --> 30:13.344
Adrian was my best friend.

30:14.145 --> 30:16.247
Before he died,
he was staying with me.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.216
It was almost like
we were kids again.

30:18.283 --> 30:19.384
You know, staying up late,

30:19.450 --> 30:21.286
sharing a room.

30:21.352 --> 30:23.121
And then he disappeared.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.925
Maybe if I'd gone
looking for him...

30:27.959 --> 30:30.061
Powell, keep him talking.
We're almost in place.

30:30.128 --> 30:31.529
You'll drive yourself crazy

30:31.596 --> 30:32.997
if you keep going over
what you could've done.

30:33.064 --> 30:34.499
You need to
let go of your guilt,

30:34.566 --> 30:36.034
and forgive yourself, Tim.

30:36.100 --> 30:37.402
You're not to blame.

30:37.468 --> 30:38.503
I didn't step up then.

30:39.604 --> 30:41.506
So I need to do this now.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.308
Now's your chance, Hondo.
Shooter's moving

30:43.374 --> 30:44.475
to the front of the bus.

30:44.542 --> 30:46.277
POWELL:
Listen to yourself, Tim.

30:46.344 --> 30:48.246
You can't ease your guilt
by killing people.

30:48.313 --> 30:50.048
What're you looking at?

30:51.950 --> 30:53.384
Abort, abort, he's headed back
your way. Get out of there.

30:53.451 --> 30:55.153
Don't come any closer

30:55.220 --> 30:57.222
or everyone on this bus
is gonna die thanks to you.

31:03.928 --> 31:04.929
You liar!
You were just playing me,

31:04.996 --> 31:06.064
trying to distract me.

31:06.130 --> 31:07.565
Wait, Tim. Please...

31:07.632 --> 31:09.267
There's nothing you can say
that I want to hear.

31:09.334 --> 31:11.035
Would you
listen to Adrian, then?

31:11.102 --> 31:13.238
If he had something to tell you,
would you listen to him?

31:13.304 --> 31:14.906
What are you talking about?

31:14.973 --> 31:16.307
I have a video of your brother.

31:16.374 --> 31:17.575
On it, it proves

31:17.642 --> 31:18.576
he didn't
blame you for his struggles.

31:18.643 --> 31:19.577
You don't need to do this.

31:20.578 --> 31:22.113
You're lying again.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.181
I'm not lying. I can show you.

31:23.248 --> 31:24.616
Just give me a minute to get it.

31:24.682 --> 31:26.317
Promise me
you won't do anything.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.186
What video are you
talking about?

31:28.253 --> 31:29.354
I got it
from Adrian's therapist.

31:29.420 --> 31:30.955
On it, Adrian talks about Tim.

31:31.022 --> 31:32.423
I think there's
still something inside Tim

31:32.490 --> 31:33.891
that wants to do
the right thing.

31:33.958 --> 31:34.892
If I can't get through to Tim,

31:34.959 --> 31:36.160
maybe Adrian can.

31:36.227 --> 31:38.363
All right,
you put it on a tablet.

31:38.429 --> 31:39.998
We'll get him back to
the front of the bus,

31:40.064 --> 31:42.233
away from the players,
maybe calm him down some.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.601
Go.

31:45.670 --> 31:47.338
We got to find another way
inside this damn bus

31:47.405 --> 31:48.506
or we're gonna need
a dozen body bags.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.507
TAN:
We've already
got an idea.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.242
Side approach is out,

31:51.309 --> 31:52.977
but since we cut the power,
the cameras are down,

31:53.044 --> 31:54.312
so the bus is blind to the rear.

31:54.379 --> 31:56.214
What're you thinking?

31:56.281 --> 31:58.249
Get up on the roof, drop down
through the emergency panel.

31:58.316 --> 31:59.517
He'll never see us coming.

32:03.655 --> 32:05.657
Nice and easy now, Tim.

32:05.723 --> 32:07.025
We're just
gonna creep up,

32:07.091 --> 32:08.192
drop the tablet
on the steps,

32:08.259 --> 32:09.961
and then
back away, okay?

32:10.028 --> 32:12.196
Driver's got
to open the door, Tim.

32:31.582 --> 32:35.053
Hey, it's Adrian.
I'm two weeks clean,

32:35.119 --> 32:36.988
thinking about everything worth

32:37.055 --> 32:38.289
staying clean for.

32:38.356 --> 32:40.625
First, easy stuff. Um, you got

32:40.692 --> 32:42.627
ice cream
and<i> Family Feud</i> reruns.

32:42.694 --> 32:45.196
(chuckles) Concurrently.

32:45.263 --> 32:47.165
STREET:
He's in the third row,
left side.

32:47.231 --> 32:48.666
Just sat down.

32:48.733 --> 32:51.002
Nah, but seriously,
I've been thinking about family.

32:52.437 --> 32:53.971
Especially Tim.

32:54.038 --> 32:56.274
He cares more about me
getting clean than I do.

32:56.341 --> 32:57.975
He's the reason I'm trying.

33:00.278 --> 33:01.646
Seeing Tim happy again

33:01.713 --> 33:03.448
is as good of a reason
as any to stay clean.

33:03.514 --> 33:05.249
HONDO:
On your call, Street.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.692
ADRIAN:
It's what I owe to him,

33:14.759 --> 33:16.561
for all he's done to help me.

33:16.627 --> 33:18.262
(crying)

33:18.329 --> 33:19.364
Now, now. Go.

33:22.367 --> 33:23.468
LAPD! Drop it!

33:23.534 --> 33:26.637
TAN: Do it, Tim!

33:23.534 --> 33:26.637
Going hands-on.

33:28.306 --> 33:29.707
(handcuffs clink)

33:29.774 --> 33:32.009
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:33.344 --> 33:35.513
♪ ♪

33:39.617 --> 33:41.119
(sighs)

33:41.185 --> 33:43.054
Powell.

33:44.455 --> 33:46.023
That was nice work.

33:46.090 --> 33:48.159
He was really on the ledge
there for a while,

33:48.226 --> 33:49.594
and you talked
him back down.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.362
Listen, if you ever wanted,

33:51.429 --> 33:52.630
I would recommend you
for crisis negotiator school.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.766
Oh, uh,

33:54.832 --> 33:57.268
think I got enough
of a taste of it today.

33:57.335 --> 33:59.303
I'd be fine
if I never did that again.

33:59.370 --> 34:00.805
HONDO: Hmm.
I understand.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.807
Good job.

34:02.874 --> 34:04.308
Thanks.

34:06.277 --> 34:07.412
Nice.

34:09.847 --> 34:11.182
Are you Zoe?

34:11.249 --> 34:13.151
Yeah.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.453
Thank you for the video.

34:16.854 --> 34:19.424
I thought you should see it.

34:24.395 --> 34:26.597
I think he forgave himself.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.434
Question is, can you?

34:44.348 --> 34:45.783
What're you doing here?

34:45.850 --> 34:47.518
I thought I made myself clear.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.287
I don't want anything
to do with you.

34:49.353 --> 34:51.122
I know. I need
to apologize,

34:51.189 --> 34:52.390
and then I'll go.
I won't bother you again.

34:52.457 --> 34:53.724
(sighs)

34:52.457 --> 34:53.724
I'm sorry

34:53.791 --> 34:55.660
for having Hondo
intervene earlier.

34:55.726 --> 34:57.795
It wasn't right. Okay?

34:57.862 --> 34:59.363
I've only just met you.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.199
I shouldn't have meddled
in your career.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.201
Thing is,
I've been

35:03.267 --> 35:04.735
Terry's big brother
my whole life.

35:04.802 --> 35:07.305
It's maybe why I went
a little overboard with you.

35:07.371 --> 35:09.707
But seeing you out there today,
doing your job,

35:09.774 --> 35:11.442
I understand
why you want

35:11.509 --> 35:12.743
to stay
a patrol cop.

35:12.810 --> 35:14.846
I mean, you're great
at what you do.

35:14.912 --> 35:17.515
The department's
lucky to have you.

35:17.582 --> 35:20.251
Thanks.

35:17.582 --> 35:20.251
Yeah.

35:20.318 --> 35:22.353
Working with kids
fresh out of the Academy,

35:22.420 --> 35:24.622
being their T.O.,
that'd disappear

35:24.689 --> 35:26.424
if I took a promotion
and I moved up.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.692
Doing this,
I get to help

35:27.758 --> 35:28.826
mold rookies
into the type of cops

35:28.893 --> 35:30.528
that this city needs more of.

35:30.595 --> 35:33.564
It's funny, that's why I haven't
moved up in SWAT either.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.733
'Cause I-I can't
drive Black Betty

35:35.800 --> 35:37.268
from behind a desk.

35:38.569 --> 35:40.304
I came on too strong.

35:40.371 --> 35:42.840
It's only 'cause
I care about you,

35:42.907 --> 35:44.375
and I really hope

35:44.442 --> 35:46.811
that, one day, we can
have a relationship.

35:46.878 --> 35:48.312
Whenever you're ready.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.915
I mean, however long it takes.

35:51.983 --> 35:53.851
I never had a big brother.

35:53.918 --> 35:55.686
Or any brother.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.556
I'm not sure I need one.

35:58.623 --> 36:00.291
You probably don't.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.559
I mean, you've done just fine

36:01.626 --> 36:03.561
on your own.

36:03.628 --> 36:05.263
But if you ever
change your mind...

36:11.369 --> 36:13.371
...you come find me.

36:13.437 --> 36:14.805
I'll be around.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.744
(door closes)

36:25.816 --> 36:27.852
Hey, good news.

36:27.919 --> 36:29.487
D.A.'s office
is launching

36:29.554 --> 36:30.655
an investigation into
Ocean Vista Recovery.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.256
That's good to hear.

36:32.323 --> 36:33.891
Talking to those patients today,

36:33.958 --> 36:35.192
I can't imagine how
many other families

36:35.259 --> 36:36.661
there are
like the Spraggs.

36:36.727 --> 36:38.496
Hopefully it'll break some
people out of the cycle.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.731
Yeah, hopefully.
Of course a guy like Jasper,

36:40.798 --> 36:43.200
he'll probably just
open a new facility,

36:43.267 --> 36:44.635
or come up with
some new scam.

36:44.702 --> 36:46.537
Then we'll shut his ass
down all over again.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.207
Hey.

36:48.806 --> 36:50.207
Hi.

36:50.274 --> 36:51.509
Feel like a beer?

36:51.576 --> 36:52.777
Thanks, but I'll have
to take a rain check.

36:52.843 --> 36:54.312
Headed over to Burbank.

36:54.378 --> 36:55.546
Visiting Gabe?

36:55.613 --> 36:56.747
Yeah.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.449
Need company?

36:58.516 --> 36:59.650
You speak so
highly of him,

36:59.717 --> 37:00.985
I'd love
to meet him.

37:01.052 --> 37:03.354
Maybe another time.
I should go alone.

37:03.421 --> 37:04.722
Want to catch him
up on my life,

37:04.789 --> 37:06.490
and, uh, I owe
him an apology

37:06.557 --> 37:07.592
that's long overdue.

37:07.658 --> 37:08.993
Well, I'm sure
he'll forgive you.

37:09.060 --> 37:10.428
Either way,
I'll have tried.

37:10.494 --> 37:12.697
That's all
that matters.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.010
What if we
head down

37:26.077 --> 37:27.445
to the aquarium this weekend?

37:27.511 --> 37:28.980
The kids love it,

37:29.046 --> 37:31.382
and we'll hit the beach
when Lila's all healed up.

37:31.449 --> 37:32.717
Yeah, that's a start.

37:32.783 --> 37:34.852
It doesn't fix
the main issue, though.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.320
I know.

37:37.321 --> 37:39.657
Look, being part of a team

37:39.724 --> 37:41.759
at her age is valuable.

37:42.660 --> 37:45.262
But that's not the real reason
I didn't want her to quit.

37:47.531 --> 37:51.502
It's just, soccer was
kind of our thing, you know?

37:51.569 --> 37:53.437
Kicking the ball
around on weekends,

37:53.504 --> 37:55.339
getting up at 4:00 a.m.

37:55.406 --> 37:57.008
to watch the U.S. Women's Team

37:57.074 --> 37:59.043
play in Singapore.
I don't know,

37:59.110 --> 38:00.978
kind of felt like it was...

38:01.045 --> 38:03.047
getting ripped away, and I...

38:03.114 --> 38:04.882
I just like
spending time with her.

38:05.716 --> 38:09.520
I'm sorry that I had her quit
before I talked to you.

38:09.587 --> 38:10.888
I mean, we're a team.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.356
I left you out.

38:12.423 --> 38:13.691
I just feel like any day,

38:13.758 --> 38:16.827
she's gonna be
too cool for old dad,

38:16.894 --> 38:18.462
and... I don't know,

38:18.529 --> 38:21.432
I'm just, like, grasping at...
at something

38:21.499 --> 38:22.566
that we still
have in common.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.769
Yeah, I feel the same.

38:24.835 --> 38:26.504
I stopped trying to suggest

38:26.570 --> 38:27.805
clothes for her to buy

38:27.872 --> 38:28.839
when we're shopping
because I'm met

38:28.906 --> 38:30.941
with nothing but eye rolls.

38:31.008 --> 38:32.510
(chuckles)

38:31.008 --> 38:32.510
Well, I, for one,

38:32.576 --> 38:34.311
think that you have
excellent fashion taste.

38:34.378 --> 38:35.880
Oh, wow,
that means a lot

38:35.946 --> 38:37.014
coming from
a guy who wears

38:37.081 --> 38:38.349
a basic black
T-shirt every day.

38:38.416 --> 38:40.518
Hey, don't knock the classics.

38:40.584 --> 38:42.086
(chuckles)

38:42.153 --> 38:44.388
So, what do you say
about the aquarium?

38:45.156 --> 38:46.323
Yeah.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.659
Yeah, that's a plan.

38:48.726 --> 38:50.828
And then maybe we
can talk to Lila

38:50.895 --> 38:53.364
about joining
a team sport.

38:54.131 --> 38:56.000
Have you seen
Lila play sports?

38:56.067 --> 38:57.501
Yeah.

38:57.568 --> 38:58.703
(both laugh)

38:59.470 --> 39:00.938
Hey, there's always
the spelling bee,

39:01.005 --> 39:02.506
I guess, right?

39:02.573 --> 39:03.808
Mm-hmm.

39:08.045 --> 39:09.480
Okay.

39:13.684 --> 39:15.686
Hey, baby.

39:15.753 --> 39:16.987
Listen, I'm gonna wash up.

39:17.054 --> 39:18.422
Can we order in?
Because I am starv...

39:20.124 --> 39:22.560
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey, hey.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.762
Nichelle, what's going on?
What's wrong?

39:24.829 --> 39:26.797
Oh... (laughs)

39:26.864 --> 39:28.532
I just don't know how you do it.

39:28.599 --> 39:31.135
How do you deal
with this every day?

39:33.637 --> 39:35.372
(sniffles)

39:35.439 --> 39:36.774
Does this have to do with
the use of force investigation?

39:37.808 --> 39:39.076
Did you have to
suspend an officer?

39:39.143 --> 39:41.612
No, the shooting was justified.

39:41.679 --> 39:42.980
It was cut and dried,

39:43.047 --> 39:44.048
just like you
said it would be.

39:44.115 --> 39:45.850
So, then what's
upsetting you?

39:45.916 --> 39:47.785
(sighs)

39:47.852 --> 39:49.987
Just, I don't know,
the utter devastation

39:50.054 --> 39:51.889
of it all.

39:51.956 --> 39:56.861
I mean, the officer,
he did what he had to do.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.430
But he looked
wrecked.

39:59.497 --> 40:02.533
And the boy who was shot,
we-we heard from his family.

40:02.600 --> 40:03.634
The shooting left him

40:03.701 --> 40:05.002
with a brain injury.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.704
He can barely talk,

40:06.771 --> 40:08.005
won't ever be able to work

40:08.072 --> 40:10.574
or support himself
after his release.

40:10.641 --> 40:12.109
His parents, his whole family,

40:12.176 --> 40:14.912
their lives are just
destroyed. (sniffs)

40:14.979 --> 40:17.414
And you must see situations
like this all the time.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.451
I do, baby.

40:21.218 --> 40:23.521
Which is why,
every time I draw my weapon,

40:23.587 --> 40:25.956
that split second
before I pull the trigger,

40:26.023 --> 40:29.059
I weigh the consequences
of what could happen,

40:29.126 --> 40:30.561
praying that I'm
making the right call.

40:30.628 --> 40:32.663
The officer was so relieved

40:32.730 --> 40:35.065
when he learned
we'd ruled in his favor.

40:35.132 --> 40:36.567
He cried.

40:36.634 --> 40:37.902
And the family of
the suspect cried.

40:37.968 --> 40:40.037
And now here I am, crying too.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.772
I just don't know how you do it.

40:41.839 --> 40:44.008
How do you
compartmentalize

40:44.074 --> 40:45.810
something like this?

40:45.876 --> 40:48.078
I've been doing it so long,

40:48.145 --> 40:50.815
I guess it's habit.

40:50.881 --> 40:53.184
Or maybe it's just something
I learned how to do to survive.

40:57.721 --> 40:59.657
But when it gets tough,

40:59.723 --> 41:02.526
and it does...

41:02.593 --> 41:03.861
when I really need

41:03.928 --> 41:05.629
to distance myself
from this job,

41:05.696 --> 41:07.898
I focus on you and our baby.

41:08.699 --> 41:10.901
Whatever's bothering me,
it just seems to go away

41:10.968 --> 41:13.003
a little bit

41:13.070 --> 41:15.906
because I'm thinking about
what we have coming up.

41:15.973 --> 41:17.908
I think about her.

41:21.111 --> 41:22.947
(sighs)

41:23.013 --> 41:24.648
What do you think
she'll be like?

41:24.715 --> 41:25.816
(chuckles)

41:26.951 --> 41:29.787
Well, if she's
anything like her mama,

41:29.854 --> 41:31.222
she'll be smart,

41:31.288 --> 41:32.990
funny.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.561
She'll be one of
the strongest women I know.
