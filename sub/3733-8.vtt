00:03.000 --> 00:05.491
- Previously on Hannibal...
- I'm going to cut off your face
without anesthesia, Mr. Graham.

00:05.530 --> 00:07.464
- I was trying to save Will
from you.

00:07.500 --> 00:09.730
Promise me you'll save him.
- I promise.

00:09.770 --> 00:12.238
And I always keep my promises.

00:15.340 --> 00:19.140
- You finally caught the
Chesapeake Ripper, Jack.
- I didn't catch you.

00:19.180 --> 00:23.082
You surrendered.
- I want you to know
exactly where I am

00:23.120 --> 00:25.145
and where you can
always find me.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.418
(clanging)

03:34.340 --> 03:37.673
(inhaling)

03:41.980 --> 03:44.881
(needle whirring)

04:57.890 --> 05:00.427
(theme music playing)

05:19.920 --> 05:22.912
(classical piano playing)

05:28.160 --> 05:32.790
- ** Hallelujah, hallelujah

05:32.830 --> 05:36.493
* Hallelujah, hallelujah

05:36.530 --> 05:40.739

05:40.770 --> 05:43.807

07:06.990 --> 07:10.619
- Btard-Montrachet
and tartuffi bianchi.

07:10.660 --> 07:14.050
- How I found you in Florence.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.568
- Betrayed by good taste.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.693
Is good taste

07:18.730 --> 07:21.494
itching at you in your daily
rounds of institutional life?

07:21.540 --> 07:24.168
- An itch easy enough to scratch

07:24.210 --> 07:27.031
when there's cause to celebrate.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.909
Congratulations, Hannibal.

07:35.950 --> 07:38.043
You're officially insane.

07:38.090 --> 07:40.957
_ - There's _no consensus
In the psychiatric community

07:40.990 --> 07:42.958
what I should be termed.

07:42.990 --> 07:45.925
- You've long been regarded by
your peers in psychiatry

07:45.960 --> 07:48.053
as something entirely other.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.558
For convenience,
they term you a monster.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.568
- What do you term me?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.568
- I don't.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.637
You defy categorization.

07:58.670 --> 08:01.230
- Do you still prefer
beer to wine?

08:01.280 --> 08:05.000
- I stopped drinking beer when
I found out what you were
putting in mine.

08:05.050 --> 08:07.769
- Who.

08:07.820 --> 08:10.914
- Who.

08:13.190 --> 08:16.250
This means you'll be spared
the federal death sentence.

08:16.290 --> 08:19.828
They had enough
to convict you

08:19.860 --> 08:23.091
a dozen times over.
- A baker's dozen.

08:23.130 --> 08:27.635
Lest we forget Mason Verger --
you're welcome.

08:27.670 --> 08:30.309
- You're welcome, Hannibal.

08:30.340 --> 08:33.275
The needle was guaranteed,

08:33.310 --> 08:35.631
but you beat it all
on an insanity plea.

08:35.680 --> 08:37.978
- I'm not insane.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.141
- You know that
and I know that.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.910
A dozen or a baker's dozen,

08:46.960 --> 08:49.679
enough people have died.

08:53.030 --> 08:55.248
- You haven't.

08:55.300 --> 08:59.088
- A promise in waiting,
isn't it?

09:01.240 --> 09:03.231
A promise you intend to keep.

09:03.270 --> 09:07.309
- I always keep my promises.

09:49.950 --> 09:52.214
(muttering)

09:54.220 --> 09:57.121
(muttering and hissing)

10:10.010 --> 10:13.104
(mewing)

10:13.140 --> 10:15.973
(yowling)

10:16.010 --> 10:18.899
(growling)

10:45.870 --> 10:48.236
(quiet tapping)

11:18.910 --> 11:22.801
(silent)

11:32.020 --> 11:33.385
(classical piano playing)

12:01.480 --> 12:03.948
- Sanguinaccio dolce.

12:03.990 --> 12:06.959
A classic Neapolitan dessert,
with almond milk.

12:06.990 --> 12:10.255
Easier on_ the stomach.
- Sangumaccro dolce.

12:10.290 --> 12:14.056
You have served me this before.
- One of my favourite desserts.

12:14.100 --> 12:16.921
Traditionally made with
pig's blood. In this case,

12:16.970 --> 12:19.222
a local cow.

12:19.270 --> 12:23.001
- And when you last
made it for me?

12:23.040 --> 12:25.133
- The blood was from a cow,

12:25.170 --> 12:28.731
only in the derogatory sense.

12:37.890 --> 12:40.188
-Mmm!

12:40.220 --> 12:42.825
- Blood and chocolate.

12:42.860 --> 12:45.021
That should have been
the subtitle of my book.

12:45.060 --> 12:48.928
But I promised myself I would
never use colons in my titles.

12:48.960 --> 12:52.794
Colons lose their novelty
when overused.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.967
- You'll have to write
another book.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.207
- Mm. I am.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.458
But not about you.

13:01.880 --> 13:04.246
Like overused punctuation,

13:04.280 --> 13:07.010
the novelty of Hannibal Lecter
has waned.

13:07.050 --> 13:11.282
- What is the subject
of your new book, Frederick?

13:11.320 --> 13:14.551
- The Tooth Fairy.

13:18.330 --> 13:21.026
I find folks are a bit
more interested in him.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.199
He is the debutante.

13:23.230 --> 13:26.393
Although he lacks
your love of presentation.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.536
- More of a shy boy, this one.

13:29.570 --> 13:33.199
- Love to hear your thoughts.

13:35.210 --> 13:37.349
What do you think about
the Tooth Fairy?

13:37.380 --> 13:41.077
- I think he doesn't like being
called the Tooth Fairy.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.179
- It is not as snappy
as Hannibal the Cannibal,

13:43.220 --> 13:46.087
but he does have a much
wider demographic than you do.

13:46.120 --> 13:50.352
You, with your
fancy allusions

13:50.390 --> 13:52.483
and your fussy aesthetics,

13:52.530 --> 13:55.522
will always have niche appeal,
but this fellow,

13:55.560 --> 13:59.098
there is something so universal
about what he does.

13:59.130 --> 14:02.395
Kills whole families --
and in their homes.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.204
Strikes at the very core

14:05.240 --> 14:08.539
of the American dream.

14:26.060 --> 14:30.622
- Get out of my chair,
Frederick.

14:33.040 --> 14:37.033
- Shall we join hands
in a prayer of gratitude?

14:37.070 --> 14:39.436
"Thank you, Father,

14:39.470 --> 14:42.337
"for allowing us
to remove this monster,

14:42.380 --> 14:44.905
"monster of monsters,

14:44.950 --> 14:47.043
"from your flock.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.275
"Thank you on behalf
of the souls

14:49.320 --> 14:52.141
we will spare of pain."

14:52.190 --> 14:55.114
- Thank you on behalf
of the monster?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.152
Was that the magisterial "we"?

14:58.190 --> 15:01.956
- It is our cabal,
yours and mine.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.218
Hannibal Lecter will spend

15:04.270 --> 15:06.488
_ the rest of his life
In a state Institution,

15:06.530 --> 15:09.363
watching the diaper cart
go by.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.506
- We lied.

15:14.410 --> 15:17.174
You wrote a book of lies.

15:17.210 --> 15:20.668
- Not difficult to see lies
flying above my head,

15:22.680 --> 15:26.411
but it's almost impossible
to shoot them down.

15:26.450 --> 15:29.248
- Hannibal will
shoot them down.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.258
He's written a brilliant piece

15:31.290 --> 15:34.191
for The American Journal
of Psychiatry.

15:34.230 --> 15:36.994
- (sighing): Everything
he writes

15:37.030 --> 15:40.739
is always about a problem
he does not have.

15:40.770 --> 15:44.399
- Well, what he's written
is going to be your problem.
It's not so much an article

15:44.440 --> 15:47.329
as it is a rebuttal.

15:49.510 --> 15:51.569
- Hard to_ believe an inmate's
opInIon WIll count for anythIng

15:51.610 --> 15:53.612
in the professional community.

15:53.650 --> 15:55.618
- It's going to count,
Frederick,

15:55.650 --> 15:58.244
and it's going to sting.

15:58.290 --> 16:02.408
- You think he would have taken
the opportunity to gloat.

16:02.460 --> 16:05.281
- He will have
plenty of tIme to gloat

16:05.330 --> 16:08.322
watching the diaper carts
go by.

16:08.360 --> 16:12.319
So, what did you two talk about?

16:12.370 --> 16:14.998
- The Tooth Fairy.

16:15.040 --> 16:18.362
Detected a_ trace of
competItIve vanIty In our man.

16:22.410 --> 16:24.776
I would be cautious.

16:24.810 --> 16:28.018
The Young Turk may inspire
the Old Lithuanian

16:28.050 --> 16:30.780
to keep himself interesting.

16:30.820 --> 16:33.709
(Never Be Anyone Else But You
by Ricky Nelson playing)

16:33.760 --> 16:36.115
- ** There'll never be

16:36.160 --> 16:38.754
* Anyone else but you

16:38.790 --> 16:41.520
* For me

16:41.560 --> 16:44.427
* Never, ever be
Just couldn't be *

16:44.470 --> 16:47.291
(mechanical banging
and screeching)
* Anyone else

16:47.340 --> 16:50.264
(demonic screeches)

19:51.290 --> 19:54.509
(barking)

20:39.300 --> 20:41.768
- Don't want
to talk inside?

20:41.800 --> 20:45.338
(dogs barking)

20:45.370 --> 20:48.771
Oh, you don't want
to let me inside.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.911
I've come too far
to let the cold

20:54.950 --> 20:57.384
stop me, Will.
- Why should the cold stop

20:57.420 --> 21:00.412
what common sense couldn't?

21:00.460 --> 21:03.349
- So, you don't want
to talk about it here.

21:03.390 --> 21:05.483
- I don't want to talk
about it anywhere.

21:05.530 --> 21:09.352
You've got to talk about it,
so let's have it, hmm?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.493
Just, uh...

21:11.530 --> 21:13.634
just don't get out
any pictures,

21:13.670 --> 21:16.332
'cause Molly and Walter
will be back soon.

21:16.370 --> 21:19.498
- How much do you know?

21:21.640 --> 21:25.041
- Two families killed in their
homes a month apart. SImIIar
circumstances.

21:25.080 --> 21:28.049
- Not similar. The same.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.709
You_ ever think about
gIVIng me a call?

21:34.490 --> 21:36.481
- No.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.392
- You know what it is?

21:44.830 --> 21:48.391
- I didn't call you because

21:48.440 --> 21:50.761
I didn't want to.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.938
I don't think I can be

21:53.980 --> 21:57.438
of any use to you, Jack. I don't
think about this anymore.

21:57.480 --> 21:59.471
I don't believe
I could do it now.

22:04.420 --> 22:06.411
- Hold that.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.081
- I think this freak
is in phase with the moon.

22:13.130 --> 22:17.590
Killed the Jacobis almost four
weeks ago in Chicago. Full moon.

22:17.630 --> 22:20.929
Killed the Leeds family in
Buffalo night before last

22:20.970 --> 22:23.962
a day short of a lunar month.
With a little bit of luck,

22:24.010 --> 22:26.103
we might have a little more

22:26.140 --> 22:28.631
than three weeks
before he does it again.

22:38.690 --> 22:41.079
- People dump small ones here
all the time

22:41.120 --> 22:44.521
and I can give away
the cute ones, the rest stay

22:44.560 --> 22:48.394
and get to be big ones.
- Yeah, Molly's a sucker
for strays.

22:48.430 --> 22:51.024
- You're not
fooling anybody.

22:53.770 --> 22:56.136
- You have a nice life here.

22:56.170 --> 23:00.129
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm luclq here.
I know that.

23:00.170 --> 23:03.776
- I'm gonna take the dogs out
for a pee.
- OK.

23:03.810 --> 23:07.576
- Come on, boys. Come here!

23:07.620 --> 23:11.943
- How old is he?
- 11.

23:11.990 --> 23:16.882
- He's going
to be taller than you.
- Yeah, his father was.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.787
I'll come with you.
Come on!

23:19.830 --> 23:23.459
(dogs yipping and whining)

23:29.670 --> 23:32.138
- So, whatever he says
he wants to do,

23:32.170 --> 23:34.536
you'll take him anyway,
won't you?

23:34.580 --> 23:36.536
- I have to.

23:36.580 --> 23:40.072
I promise I'll try to make it
as easy on him as I can.

23:48.920 --> 23:51.229
I know what I'm asking

23:51.260 --> 23:53.797
and I wished to God
I didn't have to.

24:18.720 --> 24:20.950
- How bad is it gonna be

24:20.990 --> 24:24.949
if you stay here and read about
the next one?

24:24.990 --> 24:30.155
If you stay and there's
more killing,

24:30.200 --> 24:34.796
maybe it would sour
this place for you.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.037
High Noon and all that.

24:42.180 --> 24:44.501
- Do you want me to go?

24:46.550 --> 24:49.542
- I'd have the satisfaction
that you did the right thing.

24:51.550 --> 24:54.087
He kills families.
(sighing)

24:58.190 --> 25:02.490
- IfI go...

25:07.070 --> 25:10.608
I'll be different
when I get back.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.507
- I won't.

26:30.180 --> 26:33.013
- "Dear Will, we have all
found a new life,

26:33.050 --> 26:37.350
"but our old lives
hover in the shadows.

26:37.390 --> 26:40.723
"Soon enough, I fear Jack
Crawford will come knocking.

26:40.760 --> 26:42.955
"I would encourage you
as a friend,

26:43.000 --> 26:45.924
"not to step back through
the door he holds open.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.665
"It's dark on the other side

26:47.700 --> 26:50.339
and madness is waiting."

32:01.050 --> 32:03.041
(humming sound)

32:38.090 --> 32:40.615
(scratching)

33:15.520 --> 33:19.286
(grunting)
- I cut Mr. Leeds's throat as
he lies asleep beside his wife.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.191
I shoot Mrs. Leeds.
(SIIenced shot)

33:24.230 --> 33:26.221
(screaming)
The bullet enters

33:26.270 --> 33:30.195
to the right of her navel and
lodges in her lumbar spine.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.170
- Mr. Leeds rises,

33:35.210 --> 33:37.735
his throat cut,

33:37.780 --> 33:40.305
to protect the children.

33:42.550 --> 33:46.281
(groaning muffled shrieks)

33:46.320 --> 33:51.257
- PLEASE! PLEASE!
(sobbing)

33:51.290 --> 33:54.453
- I shoot one of
the two boys in bed.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.526
The other boy I pull out
from under his bed

33:57.560 --> 34:01.360
and shoot him on the floor.

34:04.340 --> 34:07.138
(groaning)

34:07.170 --> 34:10.333
Losing gouts of blood
Mr. Leeds falls and dies

34:10.380 --> 34:14.646
outside his son's room.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.326
The smashing of mirrors begins.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.544
I moved the family
after they were dead

34:53.690 --> 34:55.715
and later put them back
where they were

34:55.760 --> 34:57.819
when I killed them.

35:11.540 --> 35:14.373
Talcum powder on the body.

35:16.380 --> 35:18.848
There's none in the house...

35:37.730 --> 35:40.699
- I have to touch her.

35:44.540 --> 35:47.805
- This is my design.

36:07.290 --> 36:09.292
- I was told you were told
I was coming.

36:09.330 --> 36:12.299
Were you not told?
- Your office or agency

36:12.330 --> 36:15.367
called me, of course, but last
night we had to get the police

36:15.400 --> 36:17.698
to remove an obnoxious
flame-haIred woman

36:17.740 --> 36:20.834
who was trying to take pictures.
I'm being very careful. I'm
sure you understand,

36:20.870 --> 36:24.670
Mr. Price. _
- Agent. SpeCIal.

36:24.710 --> 36:27.599
- Special Agent Price,

36:27.650 --> 36:30.210
the bodies were only released to
us at one o'clock this morning,

36:30.250 --> 36:33.287
and the funeral is_ at five this
afternoon. We SImply can't
delay it.

36:33.320 --> 36:35.311
- This won't take very long. I'm
going to need

36:35.360 --> 36:37.988
one reasonably intelligent
assistant, if you have one.

36:38.020 --> 36:40.284
(clattering)

36:42.030 --> 36:44.863
Cancel the reasonably
intelligent assistant,

36:44.900 --> 36:47.869
mine just showed up.
- I can't help you with
your thing. I've got a thing.

36:47.900 --> 36:49.868
- What kind of thing do you got?
- I'm reconstructing teeth

36:49.900 --> 36:51.868
from the bite marks
on Mrs. Leeds

36:51.910 --> 36:55.300
and this, uh, cheddar cheese
wheel thing we found in
her refrigerator.

36:55.340 --> 36:59.572
- The Tooth Fairy
was feeling peckish.
- Well, OK, we'll double-Dutch.

36:59.610 --> 37:02.613
Woman's got to get
in the ground.

37:18.670 --> 37:20.763
- Voil.

37:20.800 --> 37:23.689
It's a partial.
Probably a thumb.

37:23.740 --> 37:25.731
- Jimmy, you're the light
of my life.

37:25.770 --> 37:28.034
- I know.
The print was smudged.

37:28.070 --> 37:31.642
Came off Mrs. Leeds's eye.
Never did that before.

37:31.680 --> 37:33.705
- Ijust, I'm...

37:33.750 --> 37:36.378
I'm, sorry. I'm just
surprised to see you back.

37:36.420 --> 37:39.583
- Welcome back.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.487
- Jimmy.
- OK.

37:42.520 --> 37:45.956
The mirror pieces all had
those smooth prints.

37:45.990 --> 37:50.552
Forefinger on the back of the
piece wedged in her labia,
smudged thumb on the front.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.659
- He polished it
after he placed it

37:52.700 --> 37:55.396
so he could see
his face in there.

37:55.440 --> 37:58.307
- One in her mouth
was obscured by blood,

37:58.340 --> 38:00.763
same with the eyes.
Ran an AFIS.

38:00.810 --> 38:03.301
He's not in
the print index.

38:03.340 --> 38:06.503
- We could run a "Have you seen
these teeth" sort of APB.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.647
They're distinctive.

38:10.680 --> 38:13.046
Pegged lateral incisors
here and here.

38:13.090 --> 38:15.058
I mean, the teeth
are all crooked.

38:15.090 --> 38:17.581
The central incisor's
got a corner mIssmg,

38:17.620 --> 38:19.588
the other central_ incisor
has a groove In It.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.598
- A snaggletooth
son of a bitch.

38:21.630 --> 38:23.655
- Yeah. And he bites.

38:23.700 --> 38:25.691
A lot.

38:25.730 --> 38:28.563
- He may have a history
of biting in lesser assaults.

38:28.600 --> 38:32.866
May be a fighting pattern
as much as sexual behavior.

38:32.910 --> 38:34.935
- What's he fighting, Will?

38:48.150 --> 38:50.357
(Spraying)

38:57.900 --> 39:00.721
(blowing)

39:03.000 --> 39:05.639
(odd groaning)

39:21.490 --> 39:24.926
(growling sound)

39:29.500 --> 39:32.822
(roaring sound)

39:57.860 --> 39:59.987
(dialling)

40:02.200 --> 40:06.398
(ringing)

41:01.990 --> 41:04.550
- You were asking
about the dog.

41:04.590 --> 41:06.581
Last night, a vet
called the police.

41:06.630 --> 41:08.120
Leeds and his oldest boy took
the dog into the vet

41:08.160 --> 41:10.151
the afternoon
before they were killed.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.926
- What's going
to happen to it?

41:13.970 --> 41:16.188
- Please don't worry
about the dog.

41:16.240 --> 41:20.062
(chuckling)
- What do you expect me to do?

41:20.110 --> 41:22.203
- The best you can,
that's all.

41:22.240 --> 41:25.607
- There is something else
I can do.

41:25.650 --> 41:29.142
I can wait

41:29.180 --> 41:31.512
until I'm driven to it
by desperatIon

41:31.550 --> 41:35.111
in the last days before the full
moon, or I could do it now,

41:35.160 --> 41:39.085
while it might be
of some use.

41:39.130 --> 41:42.827
- Is there an opinion
that you want, Will?

41:44.900 --> 41:47.619
- It's a mindset
I need to recover.

41:51.170 --> 41:53.263
I have to see Hannibal.

42:21.770 --> 42:24.159
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

42:24.200 --> 42:27.169
- Hello, Will.

42:33.880 --> 42:36.269
