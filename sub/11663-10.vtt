01:01.767 --> 01:05.266
Dorothy, three days on a romantic
Caribbean cruise.

01:05.333 --> 01:06.734
I envy you.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.900
Oh, come on, Blanche. It's no big deal.
It's three days at sea with a man...

01:11.967 --> 01:13.934
A man who's a doctor...

01:14.000 --> 01:18.367
A great big doctor
in a tiny little room with me.

01:22.667 --> 01:23.734
Uh, you were saying?

01:25.433 --> 01:28.200
Oh.
Let's very quickly go over this checklist

01:28.266 --> 01:30.033
to see if you packed everything
you'll need

01:30.100 --> 01:31.767
for your fun, fun, fun in the sun.

01:31.834 --> 01:32.600
Nausea pills?

01:32.667 --> 01:33.734
Took them.

01:33.800 --> 01:35.934
-Okay, seasick skin patch?
-Wearing it.

01:36.000 --> 01:39.734
Those stop-you-up tablets
that I got for my visit to Mexico?

01:41.633 --> 01:42.834
The bottle was empty.

01:44.133 --> 01:45.233
Uh-oh.

01:47.700 --> 01:49.700
Oh, Blanche, I'll be fine.

01:49.767 --> 01:53.066
Listen, honey, while I'm gone,
I'm putting you in charge of Ma.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.533
Me? Why me and not Rose?

01:54.600 --> 01:57.266
Rose couldn't keep our rock garden alive.

01:58.467 --> 02:00.533
What, I'm going to give her my mother?

02:00.600 --> 02:05.233
Now, look, as for instructions,
Ma's to be fed twice a day...

02:07.166 --> 02:09.900
-Walk her after her second meal.
-Second meal

02:09.967 --> 02:12.934
and don't give her anything liquid
after 10:00.

02:14.867 --> 02:17.000
You're talking about me
like I'm an animal.

02:18.233 --> 02:19.266
(sniffing)

02:19.333 --> 02:20.734
You've been with a man, haven't you?

02:22.900 --> 02:25.633
Honey, tell Rose goodbye for me, will you?

02:25.700 --> 02:29.633
Have fun. Don't forget to moan.
Helps keep a man focused.

02:29.700 --> 02:31.200
-Oh, God.
-Just like that.

02:31.266 --> 02:32.400
(doorbell rings)

02:34.266 --> 02:34.934
Oh.

02:35.934 --> 02:39.066
Now, Ma, you're going to do
what Blanche tells you?

02:39.133 --> 02:41.133
-Yeah.
-You won't give her trouble?

02:41.200 --> 02:43.700
-No.
-You'll be Blanche's little helper?

02:43.767 --> 02:44.867
-Yes.
-I love you.

02:44.934 --> 02:46.767
I love you, too. Goodbye, pussycat.

02:51.467 --> 02:53.500
Fasten your seat belt, slut puppy.

02:57.667 --> 03:00.033
This ain't going to be no cakewalk.

03:06.667 --> 03:08.633
Mm-mm. What a meal, Rose.

03:08.700 --> 03:10.233
And what a deal, Rose.

03:10.300 --> 03:13.567
Uncle cluck's tastes-just-like-chicken
all-you-can-eat buffet.

03:14.700 --> 03:17.066
You love your early-bird specials.

03:17.767 --> 03:18.433
You bet.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.767
Especially when they forget
to collect the coupon.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.567
(laughs)

03:22.633 --> 03:24.667
Come on, Rose. Admit it.

03:24.734 --> 03:26.700
Wasn't it worth the trip
to the bad part of town?

03:26.767 --> 03:29.200
That guy almost got my purse, Miles.

03:30.433 --> 03:32.233
Well "almost" doesn't count, Rose.

03:32.300 --> 03:35.000
And how about those Cajun drumsticks?

03:35.066 --> 03:37.967
Ooh.
I can still smell those Cajun drumsticks.

03:38.033 --> 03:40.734
I'm not surprised.
You put one in each pocket.

03:41.967 --> 03:43.700
Oh, that's tomorrow's lunch, sweetheart.

03:43.767 --> 03:44.600
Hey, I got to run.

03:45.133 --> 03:45.800
Bye-bye.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.734
Hi, Rose.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.834
Hi, Blanche.

03:54.900 --> 03:56.467
Honey, is something wrong?

03:57.000 --> 03:57.800
Well...

03:58.967 --> 04:00.533
It's Miles.

04:01.033 --> 04:06.600
Lately he's gotten, I don't know,
really tight, and I hate it.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.600
Oh?

04:07.667 --> 04:10.800
Well, I'm just the opposite.
I love a tight man.

04:14.633 --> 04:17.900
A tight man with cast-iron pecs...

04:20.133 --> 04:22.133
thighs that could choke a bear...

04:24.133 --> 04:26.367
a butt you could eat breakfast off of.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.633
Then the two of us would...

04:39.300 --> 04:41.033
Rose! When did you get in?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.633
-Blanche, I've been here the whole time.
-Oh.

04:47.700 --> 04:50.266
I was telling you about Miles being tight.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.600
I love a tight man...

04:55.333 --> 04:58.333
A tight man with cast-iron pecs...

04:58.934 --> 05:01.600
-thighs--
-No! Tight with money.

05:01.667 --> 05:02.900
He's cheap.

05:02.967 --> 05:05.333
Oh. Tight with money.

05:05.633 --> 05:06.433
Dump him.

05:08.266 --> 05:11.533
Blanche, this is serious.
And it's getting worse.

05:11.600 --> 05:15.633
Like last Friday, I asked him
to take me someplace special.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.166
You know what he did?

05:17.967 --> 05:20.166
He snuck us into an AA meeting.

05:23.033 --> 05:27.066
"Theater of the living," he calls it.
With free refreshments after.

05:28.033 --> 05:30.300
You've always known Miles was frugal.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.200
He's more than frugal.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.834
He's friggin' frugal.

05:35.300 --> 05:36.533
Why, Rose!

05:36.600 --> 05:38.500
It's a Scandinavian term.

05:39.200 --> 05:40.066
Honest.

05:42.400 --> 05:44.433
(clatters)

05:45.500 --> 05:46.433
Sophia...

05:46.967 --> 05:48.300
What's going on?

05:49.367 --> 05:50.567
Nothing.

05:53.633 --> 05:55.066
(clatters)

05:55.533 --> 05:56.467
Nothing!

05:59.233 --> 06:01.734
-(clatters)
-(Sophia) Aha!

06:01.800 --> 06:02.867
Sophia.

06:02.934 --> 06:04.066
Sophia.

06:05.467 --> 06:06.700
Are you all right?

06:06.767 --> 06:10.900
I'm okay, I'm okay,
but that antique chest of Dorothy's,

06:11.000 --> 06:13.066
she's not going to like
what you let me do to it.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.734
Listen to what I'm telling you.

06:16.800 --> 06:19.266
You live under my roof,
you live under my rules.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.133
Aw, live under this.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.233
Sophia! Please!

06:27.300 --> 06:29.500
How am I supposed to keep you
out of trouble?

06:30.200 --> 06:32.700
Why are you going
through Dorothy's things?

06:33.266 --> 06:35.133
'Cause I've already been through yours.

06:37.700 --> 06:40.633
Oh, my God, this box is a treasure trove.

06:40.700 --> 06:43.166
I guess as long
as you already have it out,

06:43.233 --> 06:45.934
let's just see
what Dorothy's hiding from us.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.066
Pictures and doodads.

06:48.133 --> 06:48.800
What's this?

06:49.500 --> 06:50.400
Huh.

06:50.467 --> 06:51.767
1920.

06:51.834 --> 06:53.834
Well, Sophia, you wrote this.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.633
"Things I want to accomplish
before I die."

06:57.233 --> 06:58.133
The list!

06:58.200 --> 07:00.100
The list! You found my list!

07:00.166 --> 07:01.934
Oh, Blanche, read it to me.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.200
Those were my dreams, my goals.

07:04.266 --> 07:07.200
"Number 1, lose 200 pounds."

07:08.934 --> 07:09.800
Done it.

07:15.100 --> 07:18.000
"Number 2, never be burden
to children in old age."

07:18.066 --> 07:19.100
Moving on.

07:20.533 --> 07:23.900
"3, make amends with Guido Spirelli."

07:23.967 --> 07:25.400
Who's Guido Spirelli?

07:25.467 --> 07:27.900
My first husband in Sicily.

07:27.967 --> 07:30.066
It was an arranged marriage
I had annulled.

07:30.133 --> 07:35.433
I left him a broken man,
and I vowed one day I would make amends.

07:35.500 --> 07:38.166
You know, Sophia,
finding this list was a sign.

07:38.233 --> 07:40.433
You must make things right with that man.

07:40.500 --> 07:43.433
Go to your room
and write him a long letter.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.834
Make your words thorough, honey.
Make them fearless.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.533
Don't stop till you have said everything.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.834
Take two or three days if you have to.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.200
Thank you, Blanche. You're a good friend.

07:57.100 --> 07:57.767
Oh!

07:58.066 --> 08:00.066
I just wish Sophia were my mother...

08:00.800 --> 08:02.967
Then I could put her in Shady Pines.

08:09.133 --> 08:10.767
Rose, here you are.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.467
Honey, I've been giving it
some serious thought.

08:13.533 --> 08:15.867
I've finally come up
with the perfect solution

08:15.934 --> 08:18.600
for your very sensitive problem
with Miles.

08:18.667 --> 08:20.400
-What?
-Cheat on him.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.467
I can't cheat on Miles.

08:25.533 --> 08:27.567
Maybe "cheat" isn't quite the right word.

08:27.633 --> 08:31.600
Just think of it as one night out
with my rich friends from Texas.

08:32.667 --> 08:34.133
Well, why isn't that cheating?

08:34.200 --> 08:35.633
'Cause you're not going to get caught.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.200
Rose, just think about it,

08:39.266 --> 08:43.834
a delicious dinner
at an elegant restaurant at night.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.200
You mean, no coupons, Blanche?

08:48.633 --> 08:50.300
No coupons, Rose.

08:50.367 --> 08:52.600
Chefs who don't wear pirate hats?

08:53.633 --> 08:55.133
Oh, I don't think so.

08:55.200 --> 08:58.133
And he'll pay for everything?
I don't have to leave the tip?

08:58.834 --> 09:00.100
That's right.

09:00.867 --> 09:03.033
<i>♪ I'm gonna cheat on Miles ♪</i>

09:03.100 --> 09:05.200

09:06.233 --> 09:09.233
(quirky music playing)

09:10.500 --> 09:13.000
You mean I can have another diet coke?

09:15.867 --> 09:17.934
Well, of course you can, darlin'!

09:18.000 --> 09:18.900
(laughs)

09:18.967 --> 09:21.900
Why, she's even more charmin'
than you said, Blanche.

09:21.967 --> 09:23.900
Matter of fact, waiter!

09:24.533 --> 09:26.467
Bottle of your best champagne.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.033
Did you hear that?

09:28.800 --> 09:32.900
Last time I had champagne,
Miles and I crashed a bar mitzvah.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.667
By the way, Blanche,
you have a large tuchus.

09:42.200 --> 09:43.867
That better mean bosom.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.633
Barry, I do think that champagne
is a wonderful idea,

09:48.700 --> 09:50.300
but shouldn't we make it a case?

09:50.367 --> 09:52.166
I may want to take a bath later.

09:52.233 --> 09:55.600
Fair enough. But if I'm buying it,
you're gonna be sitting in it.

09:57.633 --> 09:59.800
(all cackling)

09:59.867 --> 10:01.100
Hey, hi, Blanche!

10:02.600 --> 10:03.500
Rose?

10:03.567 --> 10:04.800
Miles!

10:04.867 --> 10:06.567
What are you doing here?

10:06.633 --> 10:09.900
Not that it matters, but I'm on my way
to the theater of the living.

10:09.967 --> 10:13.967
I thought I'd pop in
and purchase day-old eclairs,

10:14.033 --> 10:17.233
which, incidentally, are for a dinner
I'm making you next week.

10:18.900 --> 10:21.033
But the better question is,
what are you doing here?

10:21.100 --> 10:22.667
With these dandies, yet.

10:22.734 --> 10:23.400
Dandies?

10:23.467 --> 10:26.867
Pretty tough words
for somebody buyin' eclairs.

10:29.333 --> 10:33.400
Miles, it isn't what it looks like.
This has nothing to do with romance.

10:33.467 --> 10:37.867
What do you mean, it's not romantic?
Oh, Rose, how could you do this?

10:41.300 --> 10:42.467
Oh, Miles...

10:42.533 --> 10:44.133
I'm sorry.

10:44.700 --> 10:48.000
It's just that I really wanted
to come to this restaurant.

10:48.066 --> 10:50.367
I didn't mean to eat behind your back.

10:52.467 --> 10:55.033
I was going to take you
to a lovely restaurant tomorrow.

10:55.100 --> 10:56.300
I know.

10:56.367 --> 10:59.233
Cap'n Sam's twilight two-for-one special.

11:00.433 --> 11:03.767
"Nice piece of perch.
Your choice, potatoes or rice."

11:04.567 --> 11:09.333
Oh, yeah, I see you conveniently left out
"The generous helping of slaw."

11:11.367 --> 11:14.367
or doesn't that serve
your little smear campaign?

11:21.200 --> 11:24.100
(somber music playing)

11:24.166 --> 11:27.500
(sighs)
I feel so bad about last night.

11:27.900 --> 11:31.333
I may have ruined an ideal relationship,
and for what?

11:31.400 --> 11:33.600
Well, it's your own fault
for cheating on Miles.

11:37.667 --> 11:39.600
Blanche, it was your idea.

11:39.667 --> 11:43.133
It's the execution, Rose.
I said don't get caught.

11:44.300 --> 11:46.767
I don't know what I'm going to do.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.767
What if he doesn't come back?

11:49.333 --> 11:50.934
What if I've lost him?

11:51.000 --> 11:56.133
What if I turn into a lonely old spinster
and never find love again?

11:56.200 --> 11:59.333
(laughs)
Oh, look! Garfield caught a fish.

12:00.834 --> 12:02.367
Oh, boy!

12:02.433 --> 12:04.567
There's just nothing
like starting out the day

12:04.633 --> 12:07.900
with a big pile of eggs
and cinnamon toast.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.400
Oh, damn.

12:09.467 --> 12:11.800
I almost forgot.
The old lady's got to eat.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.667
She isn't here.

12:15.266 --> 12:16.200
What?

12:16.266 --> 12:17.066
She isn't here.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.533
She left last night.

12:19.600 --> 12:20.767
You didn't know?

12:20.834 --> 12:22.300
No, I didn't know!

12:22.367 --> 12:23.700
Where did she go?

12:23.767 --> 12:24.700
Sicily.

12:26.633 --> 12:28.367
To square things with Guido.

12:28.433 --> 12:31.166
Sicily?
What are you talking about, Sicily?

12:31.233 --> 12:32.967
She said she cleared it with you.

12:33.033 --> 12:34.967
She didn't.

12:35.000 --> 12:37.900
Then giving her my visa card
was a bad thing?

12:39.567 --> 12:42.467
Rose, how are we supposed to find her?

12:43.467 --> 12:44.433
Angelo.

12:44.500 --> 12:47.667
I'll call her brother Angelo.
He'll know where she is.

12:48.867 --> 12:50.834
Rose, this is terrible.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.266
What do you think Dorothy's going to do?

12:52.333 --> 12:54.300
Remember what she was like
when you lost her keys?

12:54.367 --> 12:55.200
Oh!

13:00.033 --> 13:02.500
She uprooted a mighty sequoia.

13:04.400 --> 13:08.133
Course, on the other hand,
she is off on a romantic cruise.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.433
So maybe he'll fall in love with her,
and she'll come home happy.

13:11.500 --> 13:12.500
I'm a dead woman.

13:18.967 --> 13:20.400
(doorbell rings)

13:22.300 --> 13:23.333
Oh, Angelo.

13:23.400 --> 13:27.767
Sweets for my sweet,
flowers for my flower,

13:28.367 --> 13:31.500
and cigarettes for after.

13:36.300 --> 13:37.834
What are you doing?

13:37.900 --> 13:40.266
May I quote what you said on the phone?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.433
"Angelo, I need you.

13:44.166 --> 13:47.133
Come over quick. Sophia is not here."

13:50.567 --> 13:52.934
Uh, I didn't mean it that way.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.033
Are you telling me
I shaved my shoulders for nothing?

14:05.633 --> 14:07.934
As much as that does sweeten the pot...

14:10.200 --> 14:12.100
I still didn't mean it that way.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.500
I get it. Okay. Forget it.
I don't need you.

14:16.567 --> 14:18.367
I've had hundreds of women.

14:20.100 --> 14:21.433
Okay, magazines.

14:23.500 --> 14:24.767
Angelo, please.

14:24.834 --> 14:26.433
We have a real problem.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.600
Sophia is missing,
and you're my last hope.

14:29.967 --> 14:33.367
I've already tried calling
Sicily's department of missing persons.

14:33.433 --> 14:34.633
They just laughed at me.

14:34.700 --> 14:37.800
You called missing persons in Sicily?
You got it wrong.

14:37.867 --> 14:40.033
You call them to lose somebody.

14:42.433 --> 14:45.700
Do you know anything about Guido Spirelli?

14:45.767 --> 14:47.834
I think she went there to try to find him.

14:47.900 --> 14:49.667
I know him like a book.

14:49.734 --> 14:51.734
I know his tastes. I know his tendencies.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.000
I know he hates humidity.

14:54.066 --> 14:58.333
If I don't miss my guess,
I could pinpoint his location exactly.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.467
Thank God.

14:59.533 --> 15:01.934
He's someplace air-conditioned.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.200
You're not being any help at all.

15:07.266 --> 15:10.166
Nobody is. I don't know what to do.

15:10.233 --> 15:11.667
Take it easy.

15:11.734 --> 15:15.166
If I know my sister, she's playing
a trick, looking for a laugh.

15:15.233 --> 15:16.633
Relax.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.333
I bet Sophia is here before dinner.

15:20.867 --> 15:21.900
(knocks)

15:21.967 --> 15:25.166
(Sophia) Hey, Mr. Ocupado,
what are you doing in there,

15:25.233 --> 15:26.633
painting the Sistine chapel?

15:26.700 --> 15:29.700
(dreamy music playing)

15:41.533 --> 15:43.867
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, pit stop!

15:43.934 --> 15:45.633
Pit stop! Whoa!

16:02.867 --> 16:03.667
Guido?

16:04.367 --> 16:05.467
Guido Spirelli?

16:06.667 --> 16:07.867
It's me, Sophia.

16:08.433 --> 16:10.567
I've come a long way to speak to you.

16:11.533 --> 16:13.400
Many years ago, I wronged you.

16:13.467 --> 16:16.934
I broke your heart, and because of that,
I've been suffering all these years.

16:17.533 --> 16:19.567
I want you to know how sorry I am.

16:20.667 --> 16:23.834
From the bottom of my heart, Guido,
I apologize.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.133
I apologize for ruining your life.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.467
Ah, forget about it.

16:38.734 --> 16:41.567
(dreamy music playing)

16:55.500 --> 16:58.333
Oh, you don't have to do this, Miles.

16:59.433 --> 17:00.767
Yes, I do, Rose.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.867
I have to show you how much I've changed.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.266
Rose, you're a first-class woman.

17:06.066 --> 17:06.767
(Miles chuckles)

17:06.834 --> 17:09.266
You deserve to be treated
in a first-class manner.

17:09.333 --> 17:10.400
Miles Weber.

17:10.867 --> 17:12.734
Oh, Mr. Weber, of course.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.066
I'm sorry, but the restaurant's begun
a new policy.

17:16.133 --> 17:19.633
We're now donating
all our day-old pastries to the mission.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.433
I'm not here for pastries.

17:24.633 --> 17:25.934
The bread, too?

17:26.934 --> 17:27.934
Yes, sir.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.600
You'll find my name
on the reservation schedule.

17:31.333 --> 17:32.166
Oh, indeed.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.200
Here it is, Weber for two.

17:34.266 --> 17:35.467
Right this way.

17:36.066 --> 17:37.900
Hey, Carl. Weber's eating.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.100
I hope you'll find this satisfactory.

17:43.633 --> 17:45.567
Your waiter will be with you in a moment.

17:47.100 --> 17:47.834
Thank you.

17:51.333 --> 17:52.834
Well, here we are.

17:52.900 --> 17:53.900
Yes, Rose.

17:54.433 --> 17:55.633
Here we are.

17:55.700 --> 17:59.133
You know, it's kind of nice
not having to holler your order

17:59.200 --> 18:00.567
into the clown's mouth.

18:08.767 --> 18:11.000
The trout amandine looks nice, doesn't it?

18:11.600 --> 18:14.800
The trout? Well, I'm not sure, uh...

18:14.867 --> 18:16.934
Oh, yes, yes. Yes, it does.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.066
Good. Mm-hmm.

18:18.533 --> 18:21.667
That chateaubriand that couple's eating
looks even better.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.500
Then, Miles, have it.

18:24.900 --> 18:26.834
I couldn't.
I think they're going to finish it.

18:32.433 --> 18:35.467
Your own, Miles. Order your own.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.734
Have you two decided yet?

18:37.800 --> 18:40.533
Yes. The lady will be having the, uh...

18:41.000 --> 18:42.300
The 18.50.

18:42.934 --> 18:44.233
Uh, the trout.

18:44.300 --> 18:47.000
Yes, of course. And you, sir?

18:47.900 --> 18:52.200
Um, I'll just have a glass of water.
I ate before we came.

18:52.266 --> 18:53.834
All right, one bottled water.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.133
No, no. That's a tap water.

18:56.433 --> 18:58.300
I have a chlorine deficiency.

19:02.567 --> 19:06.367
Miles, what is going on?
I thought you were going to loosen up.

19:06.433 --> 19:10.166
You've always been frugal,
but lately, it's gotten out of hand.

19:10.233 --> 19:10.900
I don't know.

19:10.967 --> 19:13.500
I guess it all started about a month ago
when I went to see my doctor.

19:13.567 --> 19:15.800
Oh, my God, Miles. Is something wrong?

19:16.533 --> 19:17.600
Yes.

19:17.667 --> 19:20.000
He said I'm probably gonna live
to be a hundred.

19:22.967 --> 19:25.734
Rose, I'm only budgeted
to live until I'm 80.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.300
What?

19:28.367 --> 19:31.533
Rose, I'm a man living on a fixed income.

19:32.300 --> 19:33.734
All of a sudden, I'm afraid.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.266
I'll be retiring soon.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.800
What if I don't have enough left?

19:37.867 --> 19:40.367
Why didn't you just tell me?

19:40.433 --> 19:42.633
I understand what you're going through.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.700
All people our age do.

19:45.667 --> 19:46.700
You know what?

19:47.233 --> 19:51.033
Once in a while,
I could pay for a nice meal, too.

19:51.100 --> 19:54.066
Oh, Ro... Well, yes. Yes, you could, Rose.

19:55.533 --> 19:58.066
Oh, Miles. This is all my fault.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.700
I should be a person who's more accepting.

20:02.100 --> 20:04.567
It isn't like I'm miss perfect.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.100
I probably do all sorts of things
that annoy you.

20:07.166 --> 20:09.100
Oh, not really.

20:09.166 --> 20:13.433
It would do us both good to hear
the things you'd change about me.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.033
No... Well, there is one thing, Rose.

20:17.066 --> 20:18.133
-Really?
-(Miles) Yeah.

20:19.767 --> 20:21.300
You hum, Rose.

20:21.367 --> 20:22.400
I hum?

20:22.467 --> 20:25.667
Softly, happily, incessantly.

20:27.367 --> 20:30.600
I come over in the morning,
and you hum as you're cleaning the house.

20:30.667 --> 20:32.066
<i>♪ Hmm-hmm hmm-hmm hmm-hmm ♪</i>

20:32.133 --> 20:35.066
It's free music, Miles.
I'd think you'd like that.

20:35.700 --> 20:38.433
God forbid we get into an elevator
with Muzak.

20:38.500 --> 20:40.400
You made your point. I hum.

20:40.467 --> 20:41.667
Boy, do you hum!

20:42.200 --> 20:44.200
-Listen, scrooge--
-Scrooge?

20:47.967 --> 20:49.467
You, this is wonderful, Rose.

20:49.533 --> 20:52.867
We've reached a new point
in our relationship, total honesty.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.233
(laughs)
Look at us, Rose.

20:55.300 --> 20:59.300
We're two people totally committed
to each other, faults and all.

20:59.367 --> 21:00.834
You're right, Miles.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.400
If you consider humming a fault.

21:04.767 --> 21:06.033
Madame, your trout.

21:06.734 --> 21:07.767
Sir, your water.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.500
Just a moment, young man.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.934
This is a special night,
and I've decided to treat myself.

21:14.433 --> 21:16.767
Take this water away and bring me...

21:16.834 --> 21:18.133
an iced tea.

21:21.500 --> 21:24.500
(mellow music playing)

21:27.834 --> 21:29.333
(door opens)

21:29.400 --> 21:31.734
Look who's home!

21:31.800 --> 21:35.000
Dorothy, how was your cruise?

21:35.066 --> 21:37.633
Oh, honey. It was fabulous!

21:37.700 --> 21:40.500
Lee was absolutely charming.

21:40.567 --> 21:42.233
We danced. We swam.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.834
The captain let me steer the boat.

21:43.900 --> 21:45.467
There was a casino.

21:45.533 --> 21:47.934
I lost $4.00, but I didn't care.

21:48.000 --> 21:48.867
Where's Ma?

21:50.166 --> 21:53.500
-The captain let you steer?
-Just for a minute.

21:53.567 --> 21:57.200
-Where's Ma?
-Did he let you wear his hat?

21:58.200 --> 21:59.400
Rose, where's Ma?

21:59.467 --> 22:02.767
Dorothy, did the captain
let you wear his hat?

22:02.834 --> 22:05.000
There's something wrong, isn't there?

22:05.066 --> 22:05.967
Sit down.

22:06.033 --> 22:07.166
Something happened to Ma.

22:07.233 --> 22:09.100
I know something happened to Ma.

22:09.166 --> 22:12.567
I leave for three days,
and something horrible's happened.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.333
Well, I'm back from my walk
to the mailbox.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.867
Tomorrow, the corner.

22:18.333 --> 22:19.700
Oh, Ma.

22:19.767 --> 22:21.934
Thank God you're all right.

22:22.000 --> 22:22.667
(sniffs)

22:22.734 --> 22:24.033
You've been with a man, haven't you?

22:25.467 --> 22:30.433
And it was heavenly, but first I want
to hear about your weekend.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.367
You're looking at it.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.433
All I did was sit.
Blanche was all over me like a cheap slut.

22:36.633 --> 22:37.600
You mean suit.

22:37.667 --> 22:39.000
Not necessarily.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.166
But, you know, this proves something.

22:42.533 --> 22:46.734
Left to herself,
Blanche is wild and self-absorbed,

22:46.800 --> 22:49.834
but give her a little responsibility,
a job to do,

22:49.900 --> 22:52.066
boy, she's right there for you.

22:52.133 --> 22:53.433
Where is she anyway?

23:01.333 --> 23:02.867
Ouch! Ouch!

23:06.533 --> 23:09.500
(Guido humming)
