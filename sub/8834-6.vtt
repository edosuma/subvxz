You scared me out of about

at Miss Cunningham's apartment

No siree, Bob.
Old Baloo's not going shopping today.

01:50.625 --> 01:54.458
Nothing doing. Mr. Shark says,
"You're coming with me."

01:54.542 --> 01:59.792
Aw, come on, kid.
I was having a nice snooze.

02:00.125 --> 02:05.417
Besides, this ritzy part of town
always gives me the willies.

-Well, that and the money's good.

I'm sure.
Now please move.

02:40.542 --> 02:43.709
But I hate going shopping
with Miss Cunningham.

02:43.792 --> 02:48.208
It's, "Baloo, carry this!"
And, "Oh, aren't these cute?"

It's enough to drive me

Get me the harbor patrol, fast!
There's a sea monster in the bay!

12:43.000 --> 12:46.291
Molly, you gotta promise me
you won't tell your mom

12:46.375 --> 12:49.917
-we went all the way down to the docks.
-I promise, Kit.

12:50.000 --> 12:53.959
And I always keep my promises.
Don't I, Mommy?

12:54.667 --> 12:57.583
Uh, Miss Cunningham,
what are you doing here?

12:57.667 --> 13:00.166
Wondering where my daughter
disappeared to.

13:00.250 --> 13:02.208
Uh... let me explain.

13:02.291 --> 13:05.041
You were supposed to look after Molly.
Protect her.

13:05.125 --> 13:06.375
I... I did.

13:06.709 --> 13:09.959
Go easy, Rebecca.
Let him explain.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.917
Explain, my foot!

13:12.000 --> 13:15.041
He's just like you, Baloo,
reckless and irresponsible.

13:15.250 --> 13:18.250
-Hey!
-I thought I could depend on you, Kit.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.125
But I guess I was wrong!

13:20.208 --> 13:21.750
-But... but...
-Out!

13:21.834 --> 13:23.375
Come on, kiddo.

13:23.750 --> 13:27.625
Man, there's no point trying to talk
when she's that steamed.

13:27.709 --> 13:31.041
-[elevator dings]
-But, Baloo, it wasn't my fault.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.709
I did everything I was supposed to.

13:34.166 --> 13:36.542
That's the way it goes some days.

13:36.625 --> 13:40.625
Hey, Baloo,
the harbor patrol is using dynamite

13:40.709 --> 13:43.166
to chase a sea monster out of the bay.

13:43.250 --> 13:45.500
You have any tartar sauce?

13:45.583 --> 13:47.375
You hear that, Kit?

13:47.458 --> 13:50.083
Forget all this and let's go watch.

13:50.166 --> 13:53.041
No, Miss Cunningham thinks I let her down.

13:53.125 --> 13:56.709
I've gotta convince her
to give me one more chance.

13:56.792 --> 14:00.875
Well, lots of luck, partner.
You're gonna need it.

14:00.959 --> 14:03.125
[panting]

14:03.208 --> 14:06.834
A sea monster in Cape Suzette.
[laughing]

14:06.959 --> 14:08.917
What's this city coming to?

14:09.000 --> 14:10.625
Yeah, what next?

14:10.709 --> 14:12.375
-[explosion]
-[yelps]

14:12.458 --> 14:15.917
This ought to chase
that critter out of here.

14:17.041 --> 14:23.000
-Look! There it goes, that away.
-But the channel is back that way.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.417
[otter] Oops.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.291
Molly, honey, put this away for Mommy.

14:27.375 --> 14:30.583
-Just like Baloo, irresponsible.
-[Kit] Please, Miss Cunningham.

14:30.667 --> 14:32.458
-Careless, foolish.
-[Kit] I need to talk to you.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.792
Go away, young man,
I have nothing more to say to you.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.250
Gosh, all fishhooks.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.083
She's never been this mad at me.

14:40.166 --> 14:42.625
How can I get her to let me in?

14:42.709 --> 14:46.417
I could tell her there's a giant squid
crawling up her waterfall.

14:46.500 --> 14:51.041
Holy cow! There is a giant squid
crawling up her waterfall!

14:57.750 --> 14:59.917
And put this away, too, honey.

15:02.208 --> 15:03.542
[grunts]

15:04.500 --> 15:07.625
Oh, and here's some Frosty Pep for you.

15:07.709 --> 15:08.959
Thanks.

15:09.166 --> 15:10.667
Now, where's that other carton?

15:15.834 --> 15:17.000
Ah, here it is.

15:17.083 --> 15:19.834
-Molly?
-You called me, Mommy?

15:19.917 --> 15:24.667
Put this Frosty Pep with the one
I just gave...

15:26.709 --> 15:29.166
[yelling]

15:30.750 --> 15:31.834
Too late.

15:32.417 --> 15:33.542
[growling]

15:37.166 --> 15:38.875
[yelling]

15:42.458 --> 15:44.208
Hello, operator?

15:44.291 --> 15:45.125
[yells]

15:45.208 --> 15:46.709
Help!

15:48.792 --> 15:53.458
Sea monster. [laughs]
That Wildcat.

15:56.291 --> 15:58.375
Great flaming cat whiskers!

15:58.458 --> 16:02.083
Hello, Wildcat.
Let me talk to Baloo.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.750
I'll get him, Kit.
Hold the phone.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.500
[Kit] <i>I am! I am!</i>

16:07.875 --> 16:11.125
Hey, Baloo! Phone!

16:11.208 --> 16:15.667
Not now.
I got to save Kit from the sea monster.

16:15.750 --> 16:19.667
Kit, maybe you should call back
when you're not being eaten.

16:21.041 --> 16:23.542
I don't want to play anymore.

16:25.250 --> 16:27.875
[yelps]
Molly, you get in here this instant!

16:27.959 --> 16:29.875
Time to get off the phone, Molly.

16:29.959 --> 16:31.291
Uh-oh.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.709
Hold her, Kit!

16:33.792 --> 16:36.250
[Baloo] Holy shamoly!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.792
[yelling]

16:45.875 --> 16:48.917
[laughs]
Hey, kiddo, some ride, huh?

16:49.000 --> 16:51.208
I'm ready for my nap now.

16:51.291 --> 16:53.291
You sit tight, OK?

16:54.709 --> 16:56.166
Great catch, skipper.

16:56.250 --> 16:59.875
Yeah, now tell me
what in blue blazes is going on.

17:00.291 --> 17:05.290
-Later. We've got to save Rebecca.
-Hold on to your kneecaps.

17:05.916 --> 17:09.000
Take that, you big sushi!

17:09.250 --> 17:12.165
And this! And that!

17:12.250 --> 17:13.165
[groans]

17:14.333 --> 17:16.875
How did that slimy--
Ooh!

17:16.959 --> 17:20.750
Baloo, when did you teach
the <i>Sea Duck </i> to hover like this?

17:20.834 --> 17:23.458
Hover? This plane can't hover.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.458
Uh-oh.
Oh, baby!

17:26.541 --> 17:29.333
This is getting serious.

17:46.834 --> 17:48.959
Looks like you've got a hitchhiker.

17:49.041 --> 17:51.458
And a practical joker, at that.

17:51.542 --> 17:55.917
[Mad Dog] If we go back empty-handed,
captain's gonna blow his stack.

17:56.208 --> 17:59.625
-See where we are.
-Okey-dokey.

17:59.709 --> 18:03.375
But I ain't using
that periscope no more.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.792
Yumpin' yiminy!
Sink! Sink!

18:07.875 --> 18:10.917
You mean dive! Dive!

18:11.834 --> 18:15.875
Oh, I'm so sorry.
You were right.

18:15.959 --> 18:18.792
That is a sink.
[laughs]

18:18.875 --> 18:21.250
[Dumptruck]
You first, me hearty.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.834
Mad Dog, let's go home.

18:27.834 --> 18:29.375
Watch out for buildings, Baloo!

18:29.458 --> 18:31.750
[Baloo] I would if I could see 'em.

18:35.500 --> 18:37.709
Cut that out, you big sea slug.

18:37.792 --> 18:42.625
I'm flying us out over the ocean
before our pal grabs another high-rise.

18:42.709 --> 18:43.625
[slurps]

18:43.709 --> 18:45.125
[growls]

18:45.208 --> 18:46.458
Come on!

18:47.959 --> 18:50.458
It's OK now, Molly.
He can't touch you.

18:50.542 --> 18:54.083
[yelling]
Kit! Kit!

18:56.000 --> 18:57.583
[yells]

18:58.500 --> 19:02.333
It's the ice cream.
The squid wants the ice cream.

19:02.417 --> 19:05.333
[Baloo]
You got to get rid of this squid, Kit.

19:05.417 --> 19:07.542
No kidding. Hang on.

19:07.625 --> 19:10.291
Ah-ha. Red-hot pepper.

19:10.375 --> 19:13.875
This will have a lot more pep
than Frosty Pep.

19:14.750 --> 19:18.834
What is keeping those underwater whinnies?

19:18.917 --> 19:22.166
Ah-ha.
My master thieves have returned.

19:22.625 --> 19:25.959
Simply hi, captain.
How's every little thing?

19:26.041 --> 19:29.125
Never mind about that.
What treasures have you brought me?

19:29.208 --> 19:32.208
You may now shower me with them.
Come, come.

19:32.291 --> 19:37.083
Well, um, well,
we just got you what you asked for...

19:37.166 --> 19:39.333
a kitchen sink.

19:39.417 --> 19:43.834
Sink? I don't need no stinking sink!

19:47.125 --> 19:49.667
He sank our sink.

19:49.750 --> 19:52.333
Here, sweet tooth, try this.

19:54.041 --> 19:56.750
Hey! That's my Frosty Pep.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.667
No, Molly, don't!

19:58.750 --> 19:59.917
[screaming]

20:03.333 --> 20:04.417
Yum...

20:04.500 --> 20:07.875
Hold her steady, Baloo.
I'm going out.

20:08.208 --> 20:10.458
Yum, yum.

20:10.583 --> 20:11.709
Kit!

20:19.208 --> 20:21.959
I got you, Molly.
Just hold on.

20:25.834 --> 20:30.333
You two idiots are going back in there
and stealing something good.

20:30.417 --> 20:35.458
Something special. Something grand.
Give me something big.

20:38.208 --> 20:40.417
Wowee!

20:41.333 --> 20:46.000
Well, as soon as Baloo picks us up,
I'll take you home.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.959
Aw, do we have to?
Let's do it again.

20:49.750 --> 20:54.792
Uh... but why say "dive, dive"
when you want to sink?

20:54.875 --> 20:57.166
'Cause you don't say "sink, sink."

20:57.250 --> 21:01.250
-Row! Row!
-[Dumptruck] Aye-aye, captain-captain.

21:09.333 --> 21:10.709
[door opens]

21:10.792 --> 21:13.959
-[Molly] Mommy!
-[gasps] Molly!

21:23.166 --> 21:25.583
[Rebecca]
Kit, get back in here.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.083
Go easy, Becky.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.583
You should've seen him
tackle that monster.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.291
Why, he's the squid-fightingest little--

21:36.375 --> 21:37.834
Hush!

21:38.250 --> 21:40.041
Come here, young man.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.709
Kit, can you forgive me?

21:43.834 --> 21:47.750
If it hadn't been for you, I don't know
what might have happened to Molly.

21:48.125 --> 21:52.083
-Or me.
-Well, uh, gee, thanks.

21:52.166 --> 21:56.792
Of course, if you want to babysit again,
you've got to complete your job.

21:56.875 --> 21:58.959
-Huh?
-Put Molly to bed.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.959
Come on, kiddo.
I'll read you a story.

22:02.041 --> 22:07.291
Great. Kit, will you clonk your head
on the chairs for me again?

22:07.375 --> 22:09.208
Uh, no.
