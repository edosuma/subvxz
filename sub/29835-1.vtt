WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:03.335
(music plays)

00:18.486 --> 00:20.552
Sleep tight, my little
calabazito...

00:20.554 --> 00:23.989
mamá will return...and I will
bring with me a better life

00:23.991 --> 00:29.461
until we're together again,
mijo...dream grande!

00:52.153 --> 00:55.254
Thank you so much for the
awesome birthday
party, papa!

00:55.256 --> 01:00.259
You needn't thank me, Chiqui -
just as long
as you had a good time!

01:00.828 --> 01:06.065
Tell me - how's my little
calabazito doing
on his eighth birthday?

01:07.334 --> 01:09.802
Eight feels a lot
like seven, papa!

01:10.171 --> 01:10.936
Hahaha!

01:12.907 --> 01:16.241
I trust that is a good thing!

01:17.111 --> 01:22.014
But, listen to me, mijo...I have
something
important to discuss with you.

01:22.016 --> 01:22.915
You do?

01:23.350 --> 01:24.583
Sí, I do.

01:24.585 --> 01:28.287
Ocho is a monumental
age for you.

01:28.289 --> 01:29.288
It is?

01:29.290 --> 01:30.289
Sí.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.290
How so?

01:31.292 --> 01:34.526
Now that you are eight,
my little hombre,

01:34.528 --> 01:37.262
you are old enough to
make your first journey

01:37.264 --> 01:38.931
into The Beyond!

01:40.134 --> 01:41.033
I am?

01:41.035 --> 01:43.869
Yes! You are!

01:43.871 --> 01:45.437
Oh, papá!

01:45.439 --> 01:46.438
Does that mean...?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.807
Yes, it does, mijo!

01:48.809 --> 01:54.113
You can find your mamá, and help
bring her back home to
us...where she belongs!

01:55.249 --> 01:56.248
No way!

01:56.250 --> 01:57.549
I can't wait!

01:57.918 --> 01:59.718
Do you think we can find her?!

01:59.720 --> 02:02.621
It has never been a
question of if, mijo...

02:02.623 --> 02:06.325
it has always been a
question of when.

02:06.327 --> 02:12.030
And, now that you are growing
into a fine
young man, it is time.

02:12.900 --> 02:15.767
But, I still don't
understand, papá...

02:15.769 --> 02:20.506
if mamá loved us so much...
why did she go away?

02:20.508 --> 02:27.079
I knew the day would come when
you would ask
these questions, Chiqui.

02:27.081 --> 02:32.518
Sometimes, we do things that
aren't easily
understood by others.

02:33.154 --> 02:35.320
This is part of life.

02:35.322 --> 02:39.992
Part of growing up.

02:39.993 --> 02:44.663
Your mamá loved you very, very
much - still
does - of that, I am certain.

02:44.865 --> 02:51.703
But, while she cherished her
familia more than life itself,
she had a dream!

02:51.705 --> 02:59.545
My sweet Julieta held a talent
so strong, so insistent, that
its bright glow threatened

02:59.547 --> 03:03.282
to burn her to ash,
from the inside out!

03:03.284 --> 03:04.283
Ow!

03:04.285 --> 03:06.685
That sounds like
some painful talent!

03:06.687 --> 03:10.239
Sí, Chiqui.

03:10.240 --> 03:13.792
But, what was far more painful
than watching the love of my
life's light go dim, was

03:13.794 --> 03:16.228
knowing that your mamá bonita

03:16.230 --> 03:19.131
would let her passion
go unfulfilled,

03:19.133 --> 03:21.633
and her dream go
unrealized..

03:21.635 --> 03:23.268
because of us!

03:24.138 --> 03:25.637
Because of US?

03:26.006 --> 03:27.873
But, I loved mamá!

03:28.175 --> 03:29.274
What did we do wrong?

03:29.810 --> 03:32.711
We did nothing wrong, Chiqui.

03:32.713 --> 03:37.716
But, us staying by her side was
only serving to drag her down.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.519
So, to truly love her...

03:40.521 --> 03:48.327
I had to make the difficult
decision to let her go.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.530
You mean...you KNEW mamá was
leaving us?

03:51.532 --> 03:53.165
And you were okay with it?

03:53.167 --> 03:54.499
Sí, I knew.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.935
I encouraged her, even.

03:57.438 --> 04:01.340
But, I was not okay with it,
because I knew

04:01.342 --> 04:05.744
it would leave me lonely,
and you, my sweet

04:05.746 --> 04:08.513
chico, without a mother.

04:08.515 --> 04:13.385
But I knew it was something she
had to do, for herself.

04:13.387 --> 04:14.753
To be content.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.189
To be whole.

04:17.191 --> 04:23.295
To know she did everything she
could do to honor the tremendous
talent she held inside

04:23.297 --> 04:25.631
her for all her life.

04:26.267 --> 04:30.202
And, whether or not she becomes
the legend we know she can be,

04:30.204 --> 04:33.905
she will be able to carry on,

04:33.907 --> 04:39.311
without regret, and most
important without remorse.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.547
I'm so confused!

04:42.549 --> 04:43.615
Hahaha!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.385
That's quite alright, mijo!

04:46.387 --> 04:48.954
You're only eight, after all!

04:48.956 --> 04:55.093
There will be plenty of time for
you to understand
the world's great mysteries!

04:55.095 --> 05:00.299
If we find her...do you think
mamá will be
happy to see us, papá?

05:00.301 --> 05:02.534
Chiqui...

05:07.574 --> 05:10.242
...I KNOW she will be!

05:10.244 --> 05:15.647
I'm going to tell you something
now, but I don't want you get
too excited, okay?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.716
Uh...okay?

05:18.285 --> 05:24.489
Your mother, Julieta, came to me
in my dreams last night.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.757
She did?

05:25.759 --> 05:26.992
Sí.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.628
And she asked for you.

05:29.630 --> 05:30.929
She did?!

05:30.931 --> 05:31.997
She did.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.199
She wants you to meet
her in The Beyond...

05:34.201 --> 05:37.836
and she asks that you
perform alongside her,

05:37.838 --> 05:42.274
in the Greatest Singer Beyond
The Beyond competition,

05:42.276 --> 05:46.111
of the Festivale De Los Muertos!

05:46.113 --> 05:47.713
The Festivale De Los Muertos?!

05:47.715 --> 05:50.515
But...I'm not a singer,
like mamá!

05:50.517 --> 05:52.684
I can barely hold pitch!

05:52.686 --> 05:55.620
She doesn't want
you to sing, Chiqui...

05:55.622 --> 05:58.824
no, she wants you to DANCE!

05:58.826 --> 05:59.825
Oh!

05:59.827 --> 06:01.293
THAT, I can do!

06:01.295 --> 06:05.897
Hahaha!
Entertaining as ever, mi hijo!

06:05.899 --> 06:08.867
Papa, what will
The Beyond be like?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.068
Is it safe?

06:10.070 --> 06:13.038
All things will be answered in
time, Chiqui.

06:13.040 --> 06:16.808
But, for now,
you must go to sleep.

06:16.810 --> 06:23.215
When your slumber grows restful
enough, you will open your eyes
in The Beyond.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.350
There, I will meet you.

06:25.352 --> 06:28.553
And all things will be
explained.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.554
Wow!

06:29.556 --> 06:30.622
Like, an adventure?

06:30.924 --> 06:33.225
The biggest adventure
of our lives!

06:33.694 --> 06:39.264
Now, there's no time to waste -
off to bed, little one!

06:39.266 --> 06:40.632
Yes, papá!

06:41.335 --> 06:43.034
And Chiqui!

06:43.036 --> 06:46.705
See you on the other side, mijo.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.573
See ya there, papá!

06:50.010 --> 06:53.845
I'm coming, mamá...
I can't wait to see you!

07:02.089 --> 07:03.422
There you are, Chiqui!

07:03.424 --> 07:05.924
I KNEW you could do it!

07:05.926 --> 07:06.858
Papa!

07:06.860 --> 07:08.360
Where are we?!

07:08.362 --> 07:11.196
Welcome to The Beyond, mijo!

07:11.198 --> 07:13.198
Whoooa!
This is it?!

07:13.200 --> 07:14.199
Where's mamá?!

07:14.201 --> 07:15.200
Let's find her!

07:15.202 --> 07:17.869
When the time is right, we will.

07:17.871 --> 07:21.940
But, for now, we must find the
town of Los Muertos -

07:21.942 --> 07:24.910
the legendary capital
of The Beyond!

07:24.912 --> 07:27.012
Come, mijo!

07:38.792 --> 07:39.491
Wow!

07:39.493 --> 07:40.992
Look at them, papá!

07:40.994 --> 07:42.727
Who are they?!

07:42.729 --> 07:43.662
What are they doing?!

07:44.131 --> 07:44.996
Where are they going?!

07:44.998 --> 07:48.400
They are the residents of this
place, Chiqui!

07:48.402 --> 07:51.837
They give life to The Beyond -
whereas to us,

07:51.839 --> 07:53.472
they are the DEAD!

07:53.474 --> 07:54.539
The dead?!

07:54.741 --> 07:57.075
But...they're moving all around!

07:57.744 --> 07:59.861
Sí, mi hijo!

07:59.862 --> 08:01.979
The Beyond does not operate by
the rules that bind our world!

08:02.616 --> 08:06.017
It is the opposite
of all we know!

08:06.019 --> 08:09.154
The mirror's flip side!

08:09.156 --> 08:12.991
So, does that mean...
that mamá is...dead?

08:14.161 --> 08:15.961
No, Chiqui!
Of course not!

08:15.963 --> 08:20.932
Your mamá is very much alive and
well, I can assure you!

08:20.934 --> 08:23.502
But, if everyone here is dead--

08:23.504 --> 08:25.937
They may still touch the living!

08:25.939 --> 08:29.174
It's one of the very special
and magical things

08:29.176 --> 08:32.377
about our Day of the Dead
celebrations!

08:32.379 --> 08:36.014
On this ONE day a year, mijo,
the portal between

08:36.016 --> 08:40.385
the two worlds opens for all to
pass through!

08:40.387 --> 08:42.954
The dead may mingle
with the living,

08:42.956 --> 08:45.690
and the living may
mingle with the dead!

08:45.692 --> 08:47.559
Is that what mama's doing here?

08:47.561 --> 08:49.828
Mingling with the dead?

08:49.830 --> 08:52.931
Sort of.

08:52.932 --> 08:56.033
Two years ago, our sweet Julieta
journeyed to the other side in
the hopes of proving

08:56.036 --> 09:04.109
she is the very best singer, not
only in all the world, but in
all The Beyond!

09:04.478 --> 09:06.211
How can she do it, papá?

09:06.213 --> 09:11.883
By entering the biggest talent
competition of her life
and emerging victorious!

09:12.653 --> 09:13.885
Don't worry!

09:13.887 --> 09:16.621
We'll still be able to call mamá
by her name!

09:17.891 --> 09:20.458
But, first...we must find her!

09:21.395 --> 09:22.460
(clears throat)

09:24.164 --> 09:28.567
I knew I should've had a cup of
Poleo tea before exercising my
vocal chords today, Lola!

09:28.869 --> 09:30.602
Balderdash, Erasma!

09:30.771 --> 09:33.338
You needn't take an elixir to
manifest the songs that emanate

09:33.340 --> 09:35.941
naturally from
your golden pipes!

09:35.943 --> 09:42.547
You flatter me, bat - but,
flattery doesn't
win contests!

09:42.549 --> 09:46.351
Especially not one as timeless
and epic as the Greatest

09:46.353 --> 09:48.453
Singer Beyond The Beyond
competition!

09:49.456 --> 09:51.856
Forgive me if I seem to
trivialize your words,

09:51.858 --> 09:54.526
Erasma, but your eventual
victory is all but

09:54.528 --> 09:57.295
a forgone conclusion, is it not?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.365
Well...yes, of course it is!

10:00.968 --> 10:06.905
There's no soul amongst the
living OR the dead whose talents
can compare to mine!

10:06.907 --> 10:11.943
And that is why you've been
crowned Queen of the Day of the
Dead every year, for the

10:11.945 --> 10:14.145
past TEN THOUSAND YEARS!

10:14.147 --> 10:15.146
Hahaha!

10:15.148 --> 10:19.117
Well, since you put it like
that, Lola.

10:19.119 --> 10:23.622
I do seem rather unbeatable,
don't I?

10:24.124 --> 10:27.292
Shall I begin celebration
preparations for
your next win now?

10:27.294 --> 10:29.761
Or would you have me wait?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.963
Oh, I don't know, Lola.

10:31.965 --> 10:39.270
When you've had ten thousand
victory celebrations, as I have,
they all start to blur together,

10:39.272 --> 10:40.305
you know?

10:40.307 --> 10:42.941
But, surely you recall last
year's party!

10:42.943 --> 10:47.779
Ten thousand skeleton mariachis
marching down the streets from
all points, until finally

10:47.781 --> 10:51.683
converging in the town square
for a rollicking
recital of Deadtown Funk?!

10:51.685 --> 10:53.652
Hmm, yes!

10:53.654 --> 10:55.754
I DO remember that one!

10:55.756 --> 10:58.923
But, I thought it
was five years ago?

10:58.925 --> 11:00.659
Nope. It was last year.

11:01.328 --> 11:02.927
Hm!

11:02.929 --> 11:08.767
So, when was the grand Fear
medley, as performed
by the Death Valley Choir?

11:08.769 --> 11:11.269
Then it
was ten years ago, Erasma.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.771
Ten years?!

11:12.773 --> 11:15.040
My, how time flies!

11:15.042 --> 11:17.008
It sure does!

11:17.010 --> 11:18.009
Ah...well!

11:18.011 --> 11:20.345
I'm dead anyway!

11:21.014 --> 11:23.615
Let's run through my closing
number once more,

11:23.617 --> 11:27.018
then we'll stop by the saloon
for a nice cup of tea!

11:28.455 --> 11:29.621
From the top!

11:29.623 --> 11:32.541
Yes, ma'am!

11:32.542 --> 11:35.460
And a-one, and a-two,
and a-one, two, three, four!

11:35.462 --> 11:37.429
Whew!

11:37.430 --> 11:39.397
I haven't practiced this hard in
ANY world, Fredo!

11:39.399 --> 11:43.234
And I thought my old music
teacher, Ms. Moody,
was tough!

11:43.236 --> 11:48.073
If you wanna be the best, you
gotta beat the best!

11:48.075 --> 11:49.874
This competition's
no game, girl!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.111
It's literally life n' death,
y'hear?!

11:53.313 --> 11:57.148
Don't you think you're being
just a bit
melodramatic, Fredo?

11:57.150 --> 11:58.483
Melody's just part of it!

11:58.985 --> 12:00.385
Ya gotta have pitch!

12:01.021 --> 12:03.321
Ya gotta stay on key!

12:03.323 --> 12:05.223
Ya gotta project!

12:05.659 --> 12:08.727
I'm talkin' bout singin' to the
back row, girl!

12:08.729 --> 12:11.663
No, I meant--forget it.

12:11.665 --> 12:12.564
Exactly!

12:12.999 --> 12:14.799
Forget them ghouls down front!

12:15.035 --> 12:19.137
Half of 'em won their tickets in
a radio contest anyway!

12:20.006 --> 12:21.673
They're not the fans!

12:21.675 --> 12:24.075
They're not YOUR fans, y'hear?!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.945
They're rootin' for ya to fail!

12:26.947 --> 12:28.880
They're up close n'
personal-like,

12:28.882 --> 12:31.916
'cause they wanna see if you'll
fall flat on yer face!

12:32.853 --> 12:36.755
But, you ain't gonna give 'em
the chance
to get no laughs at yer expense!

12:36.857 --> 12:38.423
I understand, Fredo.

12:38.425 --> 12:43.762
But, with all due respect, I
don't think of competing like
fighting a war.

12:43.764 --> 12:47.432
I see it as interesting,
invigorating, and fun!

12:47.601 --> 12:49.067
Dios mio!

12:49.069 --> 12:51.236
What's They Beyond comin' to?!

12:51.238 --> 12:57.308
How do ya expect to become a
champion, if ya ain't willin' to
pay the price of victory?!

12:57.744 --> 12:59.778
The price of victory?

12:59.780 --> 13:02.680
Let me tell you about the price
of victory, Fredo.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.417
Two years ago, I left behind a
beautiful little boy

13:06.419 --> 13:09.154
and a loving, supportive
husband to chase

13:09.156 --> 13:11.289
a dream I've had
since I was born!

13:11.892 --> 13:14.826
I didn't come to The Beyond
because I passed away -

13:14.828 --> 13:19.597
I picked my spot,  and I
came of my own free will!

13:19.599 --> 13:22.400
I came to compete in
the Festivale De Los Muertos'

13:22.402 --> 13:25.236
Greatest Singer Beyond
The Beyond competition!

13:25.238 --> 13:29.474
And I didn't come to be a
runner-up - I came
to win it all!

13:29.476 --> 13:33.578
The festival begins tomorrow,
the contest is on Friday night,

13:33.580 --> 13:36.815
and I am NOT leaving without
that title!

13:37.083 --> 13:39.484
I'm here to win it all, Fredo!

13:39.486 --> 13:41.853
And that's exactly what I'm
gonna do!

13:41.855 --> 13:44.155
Well, I'll be!

13:44.424 --> 13:45.690
What're we waitin' fer?!

13:45.692 --> 13:47.826
Let's win this thing!

13:48.295 --> 13:50.695
First things first, Fredo - I
have to be ready

13:50.697 --> 13:53.765
to sing the song of my life on
this stage!

13:53.767 --> 13:59.604
If I lose...then everything I've
done here will have been for
nothing...especially the

13:59.606 --> 14:01.506
time I've spent away
from mi familia!

14:01.508 --> 14:03.608
I understand, Julieta!

14:03.610 --> 14:09.113
That's why I'm doin' everything
in my power to whip ya into
fightin' shape, y'hear?!

14:09.115 --> 14:11.049
And yer almost there!

14:11.284 --> 14:12.750
I mean, ALMOST!

14:12.752 --> 14:18.189
What do I need to do to make
sure I'm as ready as can be for
the contest, Fredo?

14:18.191 --> 14:21.893
I've come this far...I don't
want to leave
any tombstone unturned!

14:22.195 --> 14:24.362
That's the spirit, girl!

14:24.631 --> 14:25.697
Hold it right there.

14:26.199 --> 14:28.132
Can we stop with the girl thing?

14:28.468 --> 14:29.801
I'm a woman, Fredo.

14:30.036 --> 14:34.372
A strong, independent, talented,
professional woman!

14:34.641 --> 14:39.811
And while singing has been my
one true passion and calling all
my life, I'm no stranger

14:39.813 --> 14:42.714
to hard work and competition!

14:43.316 --> 14:45.650
Let me remind you,
where I'm from,

14:45.652 --> 14:50.722
I'm the undisputed luchadora
champion of the universe!

14:51.658 --> 14:54.158
Okay, okay! I gotcha!

14:54.160 --> 14:59.230
'Member, I'm two thousand years
old, girl--er, young lady!

14:59.666 --> 15:00.665
Much better!

15:00.667 --> 15:04.402
And, not only that, but my
husband, Diego,

15:04.404 --> 15:08.339
and I are the reigning mixed tag
team champions of the world!

15:08.341 --> 15:09.507
Whoa!

15:09.509 --> 15:10.541
This is good news!

15:10.543 --> 15:12.911
You got the spirit of a fighter!

15:12.913 --> 15:15.013
The heart of a competitor!

15:15.015 --> 15:17.215
The pedigree of a champion!

15:17.217 --> 15:24.589
I can take you to the top,
girl--er...lo siento.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.524
Está bien.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.492
Entiendo.

15:27.494 --> 15:32.030
Say, if I may ask, what's your
luchadora name?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.264
La Trituradora!

15:33.967 --> 15:36.000
La Trituradora!

15:36.469 --> 15:38.202
What's that mean?

15:38.204 --> 15:40.305
It means The Crusher!

15:40.307 --> 15:41.372
The Crusher!

15:41.708 --> 15:42.774
Nice!

15:42.776 --> 15:47.245
It don't work for our purposes,
but I like the idea of it.

15:47.247 --> 15:50.248
Whattaya say we come up
with a stage name for you,

15:50.250 --> 15:52.884
before we enter that
competition?

15:52.886 --> 15:54.152
A stage name?

15:54.154 --> 15:57.322
I hadn't considered it, but
okay, sure.

15:57.324 --> 15:58.957
Any ideas?

15:58.959 --> 16:05.897
Hmm...how 'bout
Pulmones de Terciopelo?

16:05.899 --> 16:07.231
Velvet Lungs?

16:07.634 --> 16:08.800
Are you serious?

16:09.402 --> 16:11.336
You're right, it's pretentious.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.438
I'll think about it.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.173
It'll come to me.

16:15.175 --> 16:16.574
I'll think about it, too.

16:16.576 --> 16:20.244
Can we run a few more numbers,
before we call it a night?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.512
Spoken like a champ!

16:21.514 --> 16:24.916
Let's try Skull Rain,
from the top!

16:24.918 --> 16:27.151
Hit it, girl--I mean, miss.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.160
Sheriff Tato!

16:36.296 --> 16:37.495
I'm glad I caught you!

16:37.864 --> 16:39.998
I have news!

16:40.266 --> 16:42.467
What sort of news, Pins?

16:42.469 --> 16:44.168
BAD news!

16:44.337 --> 16:47.939
A couple of living intruders
have breached The Beyond!

16:47.941 --> 16:51.376
And they're on their way to
Los Muertos, as we speak!

16:51.845 --> 16:55.513
But, today's the Dia of the
Dead, Pins.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.949
Anyone can come
and go as they please.

16:57.951 --> 16:59.851
What have they done wrong?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.787
It's not what they've done
wrong, Sheriff

17:02.789 --> 17:04.956
- it's who they are!

17:05.458 --> 17:06.791
Alright, then.

17:06.793 --> 17:07.892
Who are they?

17:08.228 --> 17:10.395
Julieta's family!

17:10.830 --> 17:11.729
Julieta?

17:13.466 --> 17:18.803
You mean, the luchadora who's
been training for two years for
the Greatest Singer Beyond

17:18.805 --> 17:20.438
The Beyond competition?

17:20.907 --> 17:23.041
That's her!

17:23.676 --> 17:26.978
Well, they must be
here to see her perform!

17:26.980 --> 17:27.912
To cheer her on!

17:28.548 --> 17:31.049
To provide moral support!

17:31.184 --> 17:34.085
Or, to lend an unfair advantage!

17:34.387 --> 17:41.092
That's why the rulebook clearly
states, on page 313, that no
blood relatives of living

17:41.094 --> 17:44.295
contestants shall be admitted,
unless they've A, died!

17:45.365 --> 17:51.569
Or, B, been granted permanent
citizenship in Los Muertos!

17:52.072 --> 17:54.338
I see...why is that, exactly?

17:54.340 --> 17:55.239
Duh!

17:55.241 --> 17:59.544
The living draw strength from
their loved ones!

17:59.546 --> 18:00.611
Always have!

18:01.347 --> 18:04.882
Plus, it's the vacation
destination rule!

18:04.884 --> 18:06.751
The living are like lemmings!

18:06.753 --> 18:12.090
If we let ONE human in, they'll
ALL want to come!

18:12.092 --> 18:15.293
Yes, that'd be a real mess...

18:15.295 --> 18:20.765
but, today's the busiest
time of the whole year, Pins!

18:20.767 --> 18:23.134
My men are all assigned!

18:23.136 --> 18:26.204
Our resources are spread thin!

18:26.206 --> 18:31.876
I have no available officers to
track down
and eject interlopers!

18:31.878 --> 18:33.644
What about the newbies?

18:33.646 --> 18:36.214
You mean Spiff and Henderson?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.982
You must be joking!

18:37.984 --> 18:39.717
No, I'm not!

18:39.719 --> 18:42.887
What better way to get some
on-the-job training and prove
their worth,

18:42.889 --> 18:46.424
than by wrangling a
couple of living trespassers?

18:46.426 --> 18:50.094
Spiff and Henderson are exactly
who you should use!

18:50.096 --> 18:54.699
But, those two don't even fully
realize they're dead!

18:55.235 --> 18:58.436
They're in a fantasyland
half the time!

18:58.438 --> 19:03.508
You'll never know their worth,
if you never
put them to the test, Sheriff.

19:03.510 --> 19:06.210
Hmm...maybe you're right.

19:29.769 --> 19:33.137
What a joint this here saloon
is, Henderson!

19:33.139 --> 19:37.441
It's always jumpin' off in here,
day or night!

19:37.443 --> 19:40.695
Sho 'nuff, Spiff!

19:40.696 --> 19:43.948
No matter what time it is, we
can always bust some moves an'
drop some science in here!

19:43.950 --> 19:45.783
Keeps the reflexes sharp,
uh-huh!

19:45.785 --> 19:51.722
Y'know, soon as I volunteered
with the sheriff, I knew I'd
made the right life decision!

19:51.724 --> 19:54.792
Bein' a deputy's for me,
I'm tellin' ya!

19:54.794 --> 19:57.495
Well, ya ain't
no deputy yet, Spiff!

19:57.497 --> 19:59.564
Neither of us are!

19:59.566 --> 20:05.803
But, we play our cards right an'
nab us a baddie or two, we'll
get there!

20:05.805 --> 20:07.071
Sho 'nuff, we'll get there!

20:15.648 --> 20:18.382
Is this the town you told me
about, papá?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.483
Is this Los Muertos?

20:19.485 --> 20:21.752
Sí, Chiqui, it is!

20:21.754 --> 20:24.989
Now, remember -
you must stay close!

20:24.991 --> 20:27.425
No matter what,
you cannot become lost!

20:27.427 --> 20:32.230
It is frowned upon for us to be
here, while tu mamá is
competing!

20:32.232 --> 20:35.900
Will mamá get in trouble,
if they find out we're here?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.535
I don't know, mijo.

20:37.537 --> 20:39.403
But, WE surely will!

20:39.405 --> 20:42.273
So, we mustn't allow ourselves
to be revealed!

20:42.275 --> 20:44.242
Let's get costumes!

20:44.244 --> 20:46.877
Let's go in disguise!

20:46.879 --> 20:52.550
That would be a wonderful idea,
mi hijo - only,
I'm already in disguise!

20:52.552 --> 20:55.886
I wear a luchador mask 24/7!

20:55.888 --> 20:58.356
I'm known for my costume!

20:58.358 --> 21:01.058
Then, why not take it off, papá?

21:01.060 --> 21:03.261
Your true face can
be your disguise!

21:03.263 --> 21:07.932
Ah, but the mask of the lucha is
sacred, Chiqui!

21:07.934 --> 21:11.235
When we put on the mask,
we are transformed!

21:11.237 --> 21:13.537
The mask gives us strength!

21:13.539 --> 21:16.207
The mask gives us fame!

21:16.209 --> 21:18.609
The mask is magical!

21:18.611 --> 21:26.684
If we remove the mask, we are
regular human beings who can be
captured, injured...or worse!

21:27.553 --> 21:28.986
Oh, no!
Keep it on, papá!

21:28.988 --> 21:30.988
Keep it on!

21:30.990 --> 21:35.226
There is but ONE way I know to
gain access to the Los Muertos

21:35.228 --> 21:39.230
festivities and attend your
mother's competition, Chiqui!

21:39.232 --> 21:43.067
We must find the great
EL MONSTRUO!

21:43.069 --> 21:47.805
Only his favorable word can
grant us the entry we seek!

21:47.807 --> 21:49.173
Where is this El Monstruo?

21:49.175 --> 21:51.475
How can we find him?

21:51.477 --> 21:55.179
El Monstruo exist
all around us, mijo!

21:55.848 --> 21:58.516
He could be vending
from that fruit cart!

21:58.518 --> 22:01.152
He could be working
at that taco stand!

22:01.154 --> 22:05.923
He could offer us a shoe shine,
and we would
never know it was him!

22:05.925 --> 22:08.759
He could be that falling leaf!

22:08.761 --> 22:13.831
Or that gust of wind blowing
through the tombstones!

22:14.267 --> 22:20.004
To see El Monstruo, one must
prove that they are good souls,

22:20.006 --> 22:22.807
worthy of the cause.

22:22.809 --> 22:26.677
And this means we must do two
good deeds for the citizens

22:26.679 --> 22:29.947
of the town of Los Muertos!

22:29.949 --> 22:32.116
Two good deeds?!

22:32.117 --> 22:34.284
But, how will we know what sort
of deeds will be good enough?

22:34.287 --> 22:35.519
How do we choose?

22:46.299 --> 22:47.298
Spiff.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.032
Henderson.

22:48.501 --> 22:49.367
Sheriff Tato!

22:49.369 --> 22:54.038
We was just patrollin' this here
saloon for any signs o'
wrong-doin', sir!

22:54.307 --> 22:55.606
That's right, Sheriff!

22:55.875 --> 22:59.377
We got our eye on all o' these
ne'er-do-wells!

22:59.379 --> 23:01.545
Actin' up, they are!

23:01.547 --> 23:04.815
Bustin' glasses, hootin',
hollerin', an' whatnot!

23:04.817 --> 23:07.017
But, don't worry, sir!

23:07.019 --> 23:09.920
We'll haul in the proper
offenders, lickety-split!

23:10.523 --> 23:14.225
I'm sure you
men'll do just fine.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.761
But, that's not why I'm here.

23:16.763 --> 23:18.162
It's not?

23:18.164 --> 23:19.163
No.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.164
I knew it!

23:20.166 --> 23:21.432
We're bein' fired!

23:21.434 --> 23:23.000
Gettin' the ax!

23:23.002 --> 23:25.002
Receivin' our walkin' papers!

23:25.004 --> 23:26.036
Oh, Sheriff!

23:26.038 --> 23:28.406
Give us one more chance!

23:28.408 --> 23:31.008
We won't letcha down, I swear!

23:31.010 --> 23:33.344
That's right!

23:33.345 --> 23:35.679
We'll drag half this saloon into
the pokey, if'n we gotta!

23:35.681 --> 23:38.716
Pfft!

23:38.717 --> 23:41.752
We'll arrest every last patron
here - includin'
the piano player!

23:42.188 --> 23:45.256
I appreciate your
due diligence, men!

23:45.558 --> 23:49.393
But, we've got another kinda
problem to deal with.

23:49.395 --> 23:51.028
Point it out, sir!

23:51.030 --> 23:53.130
We'll take care of it!

23:53.132 --> 23:56.100
I was hoping you'd
say that, Spiff.

23:56.102 --> 24:01.105
Seems our town's about to get a
visit from
a couple of outsiders.

24:01.574 --> 24:02.640
Outsiders?!

24:03.276 --> 24:05.075
We'll hang 'em high!

24:05.077 --> 24:06.710
And bury 'em shallow!

24:06.712 --> 24:07.945
Now, men.

24:08.214 --> 24:09.880
Let's not overreact.

24:09.882 --> 24:14.919
I've heard through the grapevine
that the relatives of one of the
living contestants

24:14.921 --> 24:22.993
in our Greatest Singer Beyond
The Beyond are,
in fact, here in Los Muertos!

24:24.564 --> 24:26.697
Bald-faced criminals, Sheriff!

24:27.066 --> 24:29.066
Their days are numbered, sir!

24:29.068 --> 24:30.634
Mark our words!

24:30.636 --> 24:38.309
As you men know, our law-keeping
resources are stretched to the
breaking point tonight.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.812
So, I'm entrusting this matter
to you two.

24:42.248 --> 24:48.385
Don't let me down...and, uh,
don't overreact, yeah?

24:48.921 --> 24:51.422
We're the men for the job,
Sheriff!

24:51.424 --> 24:53.875
That's right!

24:53.876 --> 24:56.327
Ain't no truant relatives gonna
evade the long arm o' the
law Beyond!

24:56.329 --> 24:57.394
Oorah!

24:57.597 --> 24:59.163
Spread 'em, grandpa!

24:59.432 --> 25:04.335
The two you're looking for are a
father and son duo.

25:04.337 --> 25:05.436
A team!

25:05.438 --> 25:08.305
Are they armed
an' dangerous, sir?!

25:08.307 --> 25:09.607
Probably not.

25:09.609 --> 25:10.674
Dang!

25:10.676 --> 25:16.947
If you find 'em, just identify
yourselves
and explain the situation.

25:16.949 --> 25:22.186
Living relatives are expressly
prohibited
in contests of the dead.

25:22.388 --> 25:25.322
I'm sure they'll understand.

25:25.324 --> 25:26.323
They better!

25:26.325 --> 25:28.225
'Cause if they don't--

25:28.227 --> 25:29.793
--it'll be curtains for 'em!

25:29.795 --> 25:30.861
Best of luck, men.

25:31.964 --> 25:33.764
May the wind be at your backs.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.133
Whoa!

25:36.402 --> 25:37.601
Can ya believe it, Spiff?

25:38.170 --> 25:41.505
We got us a coupla real,
honest-to-goodness fugitives!

25:41.507 --> 25:44.808
They prob'ly won't go down
without a fight, neither!

25:44.810 --> 25:47.645
We oughta go outside
an' test our reflexes!

25:47.647 --> 25:48.712
Good idea!

25:49.015 --> 25:52.249
We gotta be ready to
nab those two on sight!

25:52.251 --> 25:53.551
C'mon!

25:58.991 --> 26:01.425
Buenas, kind strangers!

26:01.427 --> 26:05.996
I'm Tia Pepa! I-I seem to be all
turned around!

26:07.166 --> 26:09.733
And I can't find my way home!

26:09.735 --> 26:14.572
Sometimes, Chiqui, we need only
stay the course,
and the deeds choose us!

26:15.041 --> 26:16.941
We'll help you get home, miss!

26:16.943 --> 26:17.675
Come!

26:17.677 --> 26:21.111
Describe as much as you can
about where you live!

26:21.347 --> 26:22.413
O-Okay!

26:23.349 --> 26:26.183
There's a great, big clock!

26:26.185 --> 26:27.484
That much I remember!

26:27.753 --> 26:29.420
A great, big clock?!

26:29.422 --> 26:31.121
That should be easy to find!

26:31.123 --> 26:33.958
Papa, you walk Tia Pepa,
while I keep an eye out!

26:33.960 --> 26:35.626
C'mon!

26:35.627 --> 26:37.293
This will get us a step closer
to seeing mamá!

26:37.296 --> 26:39.430
What's wrong, gir--I mean, kid?

26:39.432 --> 26:44.602
You been sittin' there, poutin'
behind yer mask since
we walked in here!

26:44.604 --> 26:45.603
Practice was good!

26:45.605 --> 26:47.204
Ya sounded great!

26:47.206 --> 26:50.474
What's the problem?

26:50.476 --> 26:52.943
I just can't shake
the thought, Fredo.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.545
Listen, you.

26:54.547 --> 26:56.714
Everybody loses sometime,
ya feel me?

26:56.716 --> 27:01.218
It's the ones that never taste
defeat that're
the real losers!

27:01.220 --> 27:03.120
The eternal losers!

27:03.122 --> 27:05.322
Oh, it's not that, Fredo.

27:05.324 --> 27:09.827
I'm troubled by the thought
that, if I don't win that
competition on Friday night,

27:09.829 --> 27:12.229
all of this will have
been for nothing.

27:12.231 --> 27:17.568
The hard work...the
sacrifice...the precious
time away from my baby...

27:17.570 --> 27:22.072
Julieta, take this from a two
thousand year old mummy -

27:22.074 --> 27:26.443
bein' a champion
exacts a heavy toll.

27:26.445 --> 27:31.915
Lotta folks ain't willin' to pay
it, and that's why they never
become great.

27:31.917 --> 27:37.254
But, you...you already
committed to the hard part!

27:37.256 --> 27:39.323
You removed yerself!

27:39.325 --> 27:41.909
You crossed over!

27:41.910 --> 27:44.494
You been livin' it 'round the
clock for two years!

27:44.497 --> 27:48.165
I'm tellin'ya, gir--Julieta

27:48.167 --> 27:52.002
you're as ready as
anybody I ever did see!

27:52.004 --> 27:54.204
Thanks for the pep talk, Fredo.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.140
I just miss my little
man so much!

27:56.142 --> 28:02.613
It's been so long now, my
precious baby Chiqui's
gonna be a little man soon!

28:02.615 --> 28:04.815
Soon?

28:04.817 --> 28:09.453
I got news for ya, Julieta,
Chiqui's growing up fast!

28:09.455 --> 28:12.056
Soon, he'll be
bigger than his papá!

28:13.025 --> 28:17.294
No me lo creo!
I miss my big man, too!

28:17.296 --> 28:20.330
My handsome, strong Diego!

28:20.332 --> 28:21.699
Two years...

28:21.701 --> 28:25.369
I wonder if they'll even
remember my face
when they see me again?

28:25.371 --> 28:29.173
I betcha you've got a pretty
face under that mask, kid!

28:29.175 --> 28:31.675
Oh, you're making
me blush, Fredo!

28:31.677 --> 28:32.843
Ya can't tell.

28:32.845 --> 28:35.646
Lemme give ya
some helpful advice, kid.

28:35.648 --> 28:38.749
I get that you miss your family.

28:38.751 --> 28:40.150
Use that!

28:40.152 --> 28:43.087
Keep 'em in the
front o' your mind!

28:43.089 --> 28:49.993
And when you take the stage,
that emotion will drive you to
achieve all your dreams!

28:49.995 --> 28:55.999
I appreciate the advice, Fredo -
but, I couldn't get mi familia
off my mind if I tried!

28:56.001 --> 28:58.368
Look at them over there, Lola!

28:58.370 --> 29:04.007
That decrepit mummy actually
thinks he has a shot at grooming
a new singing champion,

29:04.009 --> 29:06.944
while I'M still competing?!

29:06.946 --> 29:09.246
He'll be sorely disappointed!

29:09.248 --> 29:13.150
I can't wait to see the looks on
their faces, Erasma!

29:15.921 --> 29:19.590
Tia Pepa, are you sure we're
going the right way?

29:21.627 --> 29:23.994
I'm not sure at all!

29:23.995 --> 29:26.362
Everything looks so new to me,
I--I fear my mind is slipping!

29:27.099 --> 29:28.699
You may not believe me,

29:28.701 --> 29:32.102
but I'm quite a bit older than
both of you!

29:32.104 --> 29:33.170
No!

29:33.472 --> 29:34.638
I don't believe it!

29:35.107 --> 29:36.173
Oh, it's true!

29:36.942 --> 29:40.310
I'm two hundred and
forty three next week!

29:40.813 --> 29:41.879
Get out!

29:42.114 --> 29:43.480
How do you do it?

29:43.916 --> 29:45.315
For my youthful vigor?

29:46.385 --> 29:47.451
Spices!

29:48.087 --> 29:50.521
And for my timeless glow?

29:51.090 --> 29:52.156
Face cream!

29:52.424 --> 29:53.190
Huh.

29:53.425 --> 29:55.192
I'll have to remember that.

29:55.728 --> 29:56.727
What is it, Tia Pepa?

29:56.729 --> 29:57.795
Are you okay?

29:57.997 --> 29:59.029
Oh, dear!

29:59.398 --> 30:01.198
I fear I've gotten us all lost!

30:01.600 --> 30:04.401
It's gonna be alright, señora!

30:04.403 --> 30:06.637
These conditions aren't great
for walking around!

30:06.639 --> 30:10.240
This fog's as thick
as guisante soup!

30:10.242 --> 30:12.242
But, do not worry!

30:12.244 --> 30:17.347
As long as we're still in Los
Muertos, we'll
find your house!

30:17.349 --> 30:21.185
Hello, weary travelers.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.921
Mi nombre es Momo.

30:24.590 --> 30:32.663
Might I interest you in a moment
of reflection, to collect your
thoughts before moving on?

30:33.766 --> 30:35.332
Whoa!
Who's he, papá?!

30:35.634 --> 30:37.100
Stay calm, mijo.

30:37.102 --> 30:38.969
Papa's got this.

30:38.971 --> 30:41.438
We're just passing through,
Momo!

30:41.440 --> 30:44.041
We'll be on our way now!

30:44.043 --> 30:46.109
So soon?

30:46.111 --> 30:49.780
Most people choose to
pause and savor their lives

30:49.782 --> 30:53.584
flashing before them,
before taking my hand.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.853
What's that?

30:55.855 --> 30:56.920
Hand cream?

30:57.389 --> 30:59.189
Yes, I'll try some!

30:59.191 --> 31:00.791
No, Tia Pepa!

31:00.793 --> 31:04.394
We don't want any of what this
segador is peddling!

31:04.396 --> 31:08.699
Wanting has no bearing on our
engagement, wanderer.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.034
Oh, papá! I'm scared!

31:11.237 --> 31:13.303
Stay strong, mi hijo!

31:13.305 --> 31:14.805
We're moving on!

31:14.807 --> 31:17.474
Yes...you are.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.210
And I shall be your guide.

31:20.646 --> 31:21.879
Pfft! You'll be nothing!

31:22.648 --> 31:24.581
I've seen your kind, young man!

31:24.984 --> 31:25.983
Charlatáns!

31:25.985 --> 31:27.184
Whipper snappers!

31:27.186 --> 31:29.586
We're not falling for it!

31:29.588 --> 31:31.154
Now, out of our way!

31:31.156 --> 31:33.190
You heard the lady, muerto!

31:33.192 --> 31:34.324
Scram!

31:34.326 --> 31:39.162
Alas, it is not so easy,
mascarado.

31:39.164 --> 31:45.102
You have encountered me,
therefore I must
lead you to your destination.

31:45.838 --> 31:46.837
Oh!

31:46.839 --> 31:48.672
Well, I'm going home!

31:48.674 --> 31:50.574
Do you know which way it is?

31:50.576 --> 31:51.742
Of course.

31:52.544 --> 31:53.677
Follow me.

31:54.179 --> 31:56.613
No, Tia Pepa, don't go with him!

31:56.615 --> 31:58.682
Ha! Don't worry about me, mijo!

31:59.084 --> 32:01.919
There's nothing this reaper can
do to me!

32:01.921 --> 32:03.854
It's you that must worry.

32:03.856 --> 32:07.224
You must protect yourself and
your baby from this creature!

32:07.226 --> 32:08.025
Shoo!

32:08.027 --> 32:09.927
Go away, creep! Go away!

32:10.029 --> 32:13.697
You cannot wish me away,
luchador.

32:13.699 --> 32:16.199
You can only delay the
inevitable.

32:16.201 --> 32:19.036
And then, only for so long.

32:19.371 --> 32:21.538
Well, consider it delayed!

32:21.540 --> 32:23.490
Run, Chiqui!

32:23.491 --> 32:25.441
In a straight line, so we are
not separated!

32:26.712 --> 32:27.778
Look around, Pins!

32:28.480 --> 32:31.181
What a Dia of the Dead
we're having!

32:31.884 --> 32:35.803
Why,

32:35.804 --> 32:39.723
I'd go so far as to say Los
Muertos is the most alive town
of the dead ever!

32:40.059 --> 32:41.858
I agree, Sheriff!

32:42.328 --> 32:44.895
Have we heard any news from
Spiff and Henderson?

32:45.331 --> 32:47.164
Have they found the
two I warned about?

32:47.633 --> 32:50.233
No, I've gotten no
word from them yet.

32:50.569 --> 32:52.970
Does that concern you?

32:53.505 --> 32:54.571
Not at all!

32:56.075 --> 32:59.376
It probably just means they've
got those interlopers
cornered somewhere.

32:59.678 --> 33:06.316
Why, I'd venture to say they've
probably been banished from our
town as we speak!

33:07.586 --> 33:08.752
Alright, pardner!

33:08.754 --> 33:11.755
Ten paces, then turn and draw!

33:11.757 --> 33:12.856
On yer mark!

33:22.835 --> 33:24.334
Bang! Yer dead!

33:24.770 --> 33:25.769
Me?!

33:25.771 --> 33:26.870
Am not!

33:26.872 --> 33:27.938
Are too!

33:27.940 --> 33:28.605
Am not!

33:28.607 --> 33:30.340
Are too!

33:30.676 --> 33:32.509
Okay, let's do it again!

33:32.711 --> 33:34.311
No do-overs, Henderson!

33:34.313 --> 33:38.115
In the real Beyond, ya get one
shot, then yer dead-dead!

33:38.117 --> 33:40.851
We're just runnin'
drills here, Spiff!

33:40.853 --> 33:44.121
Lemme limber up, then we'll
practice lassoin'!

33:44.123 --> 33:47.024
I'm the best lassoer in this
town, Henderson!

33:47.026 --> 33:51.661
Don'tcha know I won the dead
steer wrestlin' tournament
thirteen years in a row?

33:51.663 --> 33:53.130
I 'member that!

33:53.132 --> 33:57.601
But, didja know I'm a former
All-Beyond
mat wrasslin' gold medalist?

33:57.970 --> 33:58.869
No!

33:59.004 --> 34:00.370
I didn't know tha--

34:00.506 --> 34:02.372
Boom! There is it!

34:13.185 --> 34:15.385
This is it!

34:15.754 --> 34:17.554
This is my casa!

34:18.057 --> 34:21.591
Oh, how can I ever thank you
chicos enough?

34:22.261 --> 34:24.761
No need to thank us, Tia Pepa!

34:25.030 --> 34:26.897
The pleasure was all ours!

34:27.066 --> 34:28.832
And the displeasure!

34:28.834 --> 34:32.235
That skeleton back there in the
fog was one scary guy, papá!

34:32.237 --> 34:36.740
Ah, but fear exists only in the
mind, Chiqui!

34:36.942 --> 34:40.177
Refuse to let it use you,
and it will vanish!

34:40.579 --> 34:43.246
Then, can we all go home, papá?

34:43.248 --> 34:43.980
Together?

34:44.183 --> 34:45.749
Sí, mijo!

34:46.085 --> 34:47.150
The THREE of us!

34:47.152 --> 34:51.955
Pardon me for interrupting, but
did I hear you say you're
seeking entry to the

34:51.957 --> 34:53.757
Festivale De Los Muertos?

34:54.026 --> 34:56.827
Sí!

34:56.828 --> 34:59.629
Mi mamá is performing in
the...uh...what's the
competition called again, papá?

35:00.032 --> 35:03.366
The Greatest Singer Beyond
the Beyond!

35:03.368 --> 35:10.740
Wherein Chiqui's mother - my
wife, Julieta - is going to win
the title of greatest singer!

35:10.742 --> 35:11.608
That's right!

35:11.743 --> 35:13.210
It's her death city!

35:13.212 --> 35:15.378
You mean destiny, mijo.

35:15.380 --> 35:16.980
It's her destiny!

35:17.783 --> 35:18.782
Yeah, that!

35:18.784 --> 35:21.651
You boys sound very sure of
Julieta's talents!

35:22.454 --> 35:24.221
We are, Tia Pepa!

35:24.223 --> 35:30.927
My Julieta possesses
the silkiest, smoothest, most
harmonic, melodic, angelic

35:30.929 --> 35:33.230
voice of all time!

35:33.232 --> 35:37.334
She is truly a
singer for the ages!

35:37.336 --> 35:42.239
Well, she'll have to be...
for her sake!

35:42.241 --> 35:44.441
For her sake?

35:44.443 --> 35:45.642
What do you mean?

35:45.644 --> 35:52.015
I mean your Julieta will be
competing against none other
than the legendary Erasma Bones!

35:52.017 --> 35:53.550
Erasma Bones?

35:53.785 --> 35:56.720
You mean, you mean
the Erasma Bones?

35:57.289 --> 35:59.656
But, I thought she was dead!

36:00.025 --> 36:02.192
Oh, but she is!

36:02.194 --> 36:05.896
That's why she performs in
residency, here in The Beyond!

36:06.498 --> 36:09.266
Hoohoo, what a show!

36:09.268 --> 36:11.134
Who's Erasma Bones?

36:11.136 --> 36:16.673
Erasma Bones is the oldest, most
successful
singer of all time, little one!

36:17.009 --> 36:20.043
She has received every award
there ever was!

36:20.045 --> 36:23.780
Shined in every
performance ever given!

36:23.782 --> 36:29.486
And won every competition ever
held, for the past ten
thousand years!

36:29.488 --> 36:35.725
Including the Greatest Singer
Beyond the Beyond - which she
has never, ever lost!

36:35.727 --> 36:38.128
She's never lost?!

36:38.130 --> 36:41.198
But, papá...how can
mamá beat her?

36:41.200 --> 36:44.301
We simply have to have faith,
Chiqui.

36:44.303 --> 36:46.803
Faith that she can.

36:55.480 --> 36:58.315
All right now, look alive, kid.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.917
Look alive, he says?

37:00.919 --> 37:01.918
I AM alive.

37:01.920 --> 37:06.156
In the town of Los Muertos
..that's the problem.

37:06.158 --> 37:10.360
No, the problem is you can't
stop longin' fer yer familia!

37:10.362 --> 37:11.361
And?

37:11.363 --> 37:13.230
And, it's ruinin' yer focus!

37:13.232 --> 37:18.168
So, I brought ya out here to run
some exercises and get yer mind,
instincts,

37:18.170 --> 37:21.871
and vocal chords back in
tip-top fightin' shape!

37:21.873 --> 37:24.341
Whatever you think is best,
Fredo.

37:24.343 --> 37:25.709
That's right!

37:25.711 --> 37:28.545
Just listen to ol' Fredo, kid!

37:28.547 --> 37:35.552
Now, this is a little
unconventional, but yer nothin'
if not an unconventional pupil!

37:35.554 --> 37:39.522
I'm gonna throw out a line to a
well-known song,

37:39.524 --> 37:44.594
and I want you to finish it,
in key, pitch, and melody!

37:45.197 --> 37:46.796
Got it?!

37:49.901 --> 37:50.967
Got it.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.202
I'm ready!

37:52.204 --> 37:53.436
Alright, then!

37:53.639 --> 37:54.771
Let's begin!

37:54.773 --> 37:55.905
First song...

37:55.907 --> 38:00.310
¶ When you walk along the
cemetery's edge, ¶

38:00.312 --> 38:04.948
¶ don't you feel
alone and blue... ¶

38:04.950 --> 38:10.220
¶ 'Cause I'll be right there,
walking beside you! ¶

38:10.222 --> 38:11.221
Boom!

38:11.223 --> 38:13.056
Okay, next song...

38:13.058 --> 38:15.325
¶ Undertaker, don't ya
take too long... ¶

38:15.327 --> 38:23.400
¶ I only have until the
end of this song! ¶

38:25.737 --> 38:27.304
Wooo! Look at that!

38:27.973 --> 38:33.310
I ain't seen musical instincts
like yours,
since Pablo McGrande!

38:33.312 --> 38:37.814
You got it, Julieta, you got it!

38:38.016 --> 38:41.518
Now, 'bout your name.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.119
My name?

38:43.121 --> 38:45.221
Yeah, yer stage name!

38:45.490 --> 38:48.525
We need somethin' snappy!

38:48.927 --> 38:50.660
Somethin' fresh!

38:51.029 --> 38:52.495
Somethin' that screams fame!

38:52.831 --> 38:53.663
Hmm...

38:53.665 --> 38:55.332
I got it!

38:55.334 --> 38:56.333
You do?

38:56.335 --> 38:57.734
Tell me!

38:58.103 --> 39:01.538
Kiss Julieta goodbye!

39:01.940 --> 39:05.675
And kiss La Trituradora goodbye!

39:06.278 --> 39:10.513
Say hello to BEYONDÉ!

39:11.049 --> 39:11.948
Beyondé?

39:12.484 --> 39:13.350
Beyondé!

39:13.785 --> 39:16.353
LIke... From the BEYOND, get it?

39:16.688 --> 39:21.124
THAT'S the name of a
champion and a superstar!

39:21.626 --> 39:23.960
Wow...it does have a ring to it!

39:24.663 --> 39:26.529
Raw talent's an understatement!

39:26.898 --> 39:31.868
First time I laid eyes on ya, I
knew I was lookin' at a diamond
in the rough!

39:32.304 --> 39:33.036
Ugh!

39:33.638 --> 39:35.071
Gracia divina!

39:39.311 --> 39:44.647
I'm going to fall ill if you two
keep up this
self-congratulatory drivel!

39:44.649 --> 39:46.149
Erasma!

39:46.651 --> 39:49.552
Oh, don't act so surprised,
Fredo!

39:49.554 --> 39:55.158
You have to know by now that I'm
always watching your every move,
come competition

39:55.160 --> 39:58.895
time...especially when you're
galavanting around town with a
new pupil,

39:58.897 --> 40:00.997
like you own the place!

40:00.999 --> 40:07.070
But, I'm only preparing Jul--I
mean, Beyondé
here, for Friday's competition!

40:07.072 --> 40:09.623
Ha!

40:09.624 --> 40:12.175
You're grooming her to overthrow
me, is what you're doing!

40:12.177 --> 40:18.348
I see right through you, mummy -
and not just because your
bandages are loose!

40:18.350 --> 40:19.349
My bandages?!

40:19.918 --> 40:20.984
Whaa--?

40:21.386 --> 40:23.186
How long have they been loose?

40:23.188 --> 40:25.488
Beyondé, why didn't
ya say somethin'?!

40:26.358 --> 40:28.625
I didn't think they were loose!

40:28.627 --> 40:34.030
Well, with that kind of
attention to detail, I'd quit
while you're ahead, little girl!

40:34.032 --> 40:35.098
Little girl?!

40:35.267 --> 40:38.368
Who're you calling a little
girl, bone face?!

40:38.370 --> 40:41.638
Mind your tongue when you speak
to the champ, newbie!

40:41.873 --> 40:45.942
Shut up, or I'll
fly-swat you, fly!

40:45.944 --> 40:47.010
Well!

40:47.279 --> 40:48.278
Buh!

40:48.280 --> 40:50.880
Got yourself a
spitfire, eh, Fredo?

40:50.882 --> 40:52.515
I like that!

40:52.918 --> 40:57.554
What say we have a little
competition of our own, hmm?

40:57.556 --> 41:00.056
Right here, right now!

41:00.058 --> 41:02.025
No deal!

41:02.160 --> 41:04.894
We ain't that stupid, Erasma!

41:04.896 --> 41:06.963
No, you're just scared!

41:06.965 --> 41:07.964
Scared?!

41:07.966 --> 41:11.167
I've never been
scared of anyone in my life!

41:11.169 --> 41:13.136
And I'm
not about to start now!

41:13.138 --> 41:14.270
Shh!

41:14.272 --> 41:15.338
Let it go, kid!

41:15.907 --> 41:17.474
They're playin' to yer ego!

41:17.676 --> 41:19.642
It's the oldest
trick in the book!

41:19.978 --> 41:20.977
Fine!

41:20.979 --> 41:23.847
I have nothing
to hide - or to fear!

41:23.849 --> 41:25.882
What do you propose, bone bag?

41:26.017 --> 41:27.951
I thought you'd never ask!

41:27.953 --> 41:31.988
We'll hold our own private
singing competition,

41:31.990 --> 41:34.924
much like you were just doing
with Fredo...however,

41:34.926 --> 41:39.496
by our rules, the winner
competes on Friday night,

41:39.498 --> 41:43.199
while the loser is
banished to the

41:43.201 --> 41:45.869
Wasteland, for all eternity!

41:46.304 --> 41:47.470
Hahaha!

41:47.472 --> 41:49.172
What do you say, newbie?

41:49.341 --> 41:54.878
If you're as good as the mummy
thinks you are, step up and
prove it!

41:57.349 --> 42:01.784
I'm tellin' ya, Henderson, when
I see them two rabble-rousers,
there's no tellin'

42:01.786 --> 42:03.553
what I'm liable to do to 'em!

42:04.122 --> 42:06.155
Me too, Spiff!

42:06.157 --> 42:11.694
I might draw on 'em, right then
n' there, send 'em back to their
mamas in a pine box!

42:11.696 --> 42:13.196
Or, I might--

42:13.198 --> 42:18.635
Wait! Sheriff Tato said they was
a father/son team, not brothers!

42:18.637 --> 42:20.803
So, they ain't got
the same mamá!

42:20.805 --> 42:22.472
Oh. Right.

42:22.474 --> 42:27.644
It'd be like, I'll send 'em back
to mamá an' grandma in
a pine box!

42:27.646 --> 42:29.596
Whatever!

42:29.597 --> 42:31.547
They can ship 'em to the
islands, for all I care!

42:31.550 --> 42:34.150
One thing's for sure--

42:34.152 --> 42:37.921
--they meet us, they meet pine!

42:37.923 --> 42:39.889
Yes to that!

42:45.430 --> 42:48.998
It sure felt good helping Tia
Pepa find her
way back home, papá!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.066
That, it did, mijo!

42:50.669 --> 42:54.270
Uno good deed down, uno to go!

42:55.106 --> 42:56.839
This place is loco!

42:56.841 --> 42:59.509
Are you sure it's okay
for me to be in here?

42:59.511 --> 43:02.812
Chiqui...with papá, you go
anywhere your little
heart desires!

43:03.615 --> 43:06.066
Understand?

43:06.067 --> 43:08.518
Sí, papá...what I'd really like
is to go see mamá.

43:08.520 --> 43:11.387
In due time, mijo, in due time.

43:11.389 --> 43:18.528
But first, how about a tall cold
leche, before we continue on our
way, hmm?

43:18.530 --> 43:20.129
Milk sounds great, papá!

43:20.298 --> 43:21.197
Gracias!

43:21.199 --> 43:22.265
De nada!

43:22.534 --> 43:26.436
And I could use an
ice cold agave juice!

43:26.905 --> 43:29.539
Keep an eye out
for the server, yeah?

43:29.541 --> 43:30.206
Okay!

43:30.208 --> 43:31.107
Henderson!

43:31.109 --> 43:32.175
Ya hear that?

43:32.477 --> 43:33.543
It's them!

43:33.878 --> 43:34.944
It's who?

43:35.213 --> 43:36.212
It's them!

43:36.214 --> 43:37.947
The two we's lookin' for!

43:39.951 --> 43:41.017
Oh!

43:41.553 --> 43:42.752
Be quiet!

43:42.753 --> 43:43.952
We don't want 'em hearin' us!

43:44.155 --> 43:45.154
Right!

43:45.156 --> 43:47.824
Wanna take 'em down right here?

43:47.826 --> 43:49.959
That sounds like
a right good idea!

43:50.462 --> 43:52.328
Follow my lead!

43:52.330 --> 43:53.129
On three!

43:53.331 --> 43:54.397
Ready?

43:54.566 --> 43:55.298
One...two...

43:56.267 --> 43:57.133
THREE!

43:58.169 --> 44:00.837
Hold it right there!

44:02.073 --> 44:06.876
You two's under arrest, by order
o' the Los Muertos Sheriff
Depart--

44:08.813 --> 44:09.679
Papa!

44:09.681 --> 44:10.647
Let's get outta here!

44:10.649 --> 44:13.416
That sounds like a
great idea, mijo!

44:13.418 --> 44:18.955
If you two even think of
following us, you'll
get more of the same!

44:18.957 --> 44:20.423
S'all good!

44:20.425 --> 44:21.758
See ya 'round!

44:21.760 --> 44:22.925
Come, mijo.

44:22.927 --> 44:24.794
The service here stinks anyway!

44:24.796 --> 44:29.465
If you're so good, luchadora,
why not show
us what you've got?

44:29.467 --> 44:32.769
Unless, of course, you're POLLO!

44:32.771 --> 44:35.271
No!

44:35.707 --> 44:37.940
Did you just call me...POLLO?!

44:37.942 --> 44:41.244
Sí!

44:41.245 --> 44:44.547
Cluck...cluck...cluck!
(imitates chicken)

44:44.549 --> 44:47.517
Nobody calls La
Trituradora a chicken!

44:47.786 --> 44:49.118
Nobody!

44:49.487 --> 44:50.520
You're on!

44:50.889 --> 44:51.988
Oh, Dios mio!

44:51.990 --> 44:52.855
Beyondé!

44:53.058 --> 44:55.324
Can't you see it's a trick?

44:55.326 --> 44:58.828
Erasma Bones isn't undefeated
these last ten thousand

44:58.830 --> 45:00.697
years 'cause she plays fair!

45:00.699 --> 45:03.666
She's the dirtiest
player in the game!

45:03.668 --> 45:06.069
What's the matter, Beyondé?

45:06.071 --> 45:07.303
Cold feet?

45:07.305 --> 45:10.973
Afraid a little impromptu
challenge will expose your

45:10.975 --> 45:14.711
glorious talents as
nothing more than a ruse?

45:14.713 --> 45:16.713
A cry for attention?

45:16.715 --> 45:18.648
A waste of our time?

45:18.650 --> 45:19.816
A waste of time?!

45:19.818 --> 45:23.186
I'll show you a waste of time,
you old witch!

45:23.188 --> 45:24.487
Hit it!

45:24.489 --> 45:28.658
Oh, is the great Beyondé ready
to show us what she's made of?

45:28.660 --> 45:30.893
I don't like this, kid!

45:30.895 --> 45:33.096
I don't like it at all!

45:33.098 --> 45:35.865
Stick some gauze in it, mummy!

45:35.867 --> 45:37.266
This is between us girls!

45:37.268 --> 45:40.336
Who you calling a girl,
you crone?

45:40.338 --> 45:41.337
Buh!

45:41.339 --> 45:43.272
Give her a line, Lola!

45:43.274 --> 45:44.273
Yes, ma'am!

45:44.275 --> 45:46.709
Sing the rest of
this one, luchadora!

45:46.711 --> 45:50.012
On pitch, in key,
with proper melody!

45:50.248 --> 45:54.183
¶ Never before has
my jaw hit the floor... ¶

45:54.185 --> 45:58.688
¶ Like the time I saw you
walking out my door! ¶

45:58.690 --> 45:59.689
Wow!

45:59.691 --> 46:01.424
Just wow!

46:01.426 --> 46:02.792
Pfft! She got lucky, Erasma!

46:02.794 --> 46:06.062
Okay, it's OUR turn!

46:06.064 --> 46:08.431
Let me guess - you have a RAP!

46:08.433 --> 46:11.667
Hahaha!

46:11.870 --> 46:14.704
Don't let her get under your,
uh...skin, Fredo!

46:14.706 --> 46:16.806
Hit her with a tough one!

46:16.808 --> 46:18.708
Oh, I'm gonna!

46:18.710 --> 46:23.079
Lemme think...it's been a while
since I heard pop music!

46:23.081 --> 46:25.715
A vocal coach who
doesn't know pop?!

46:25.717 --> 46:27.049
What a joke!

46:27.051 --> 46:30.386
He probably dusts off his
8-track cassettes!

46:30.388 --> 46:31.387
Hahaha!

46:31.389 --> 46:33.456
Alright, wiseacres!

46:33.458 --> 46:35.992
Here's one for ya!

46:35.994 --> 46:39.328
¶ In these shadows,
it's always the same, ¶

46:39.330 --> 46:43.900
¶ you can't see my face,
you don't know my name... ¶

46:43.902 --> 46:49.972
¶ And I'll emerge from the
darkness, into the light, ¶

46:49.974 --> 46:56.312
¶ and bury you deep,
in the coldest night! ¶

46:56.314 --> 46:58.314
Wow! How fitting!

46:58.316 --> 47:00.016
It's 1-1, Beyondé!

47:01.152 --> 47:03.853
Can you muster the
guts for a tiebreaker?

47:03.855 --> 47:06.289
I don't have to
muster anything, bruja!

47:06.291 --> 47:08.758
Guts is my middle name!

47:08.760 --> 47:10.760
Don't you mean Gutsé?

47:10.762 --> 47:12.862
I was hoping you'd say that!

47:12.864 --> 47:14.931
Hehehe!

47:19.103 --> 47:21.571
What a couple of idiotas back at
the saloon, papá!

47:21.773 --> 47:23.940
I wonder what their problem was?

47:23.942 --> 47:29.679
They sounded like they knew what
they were doing, mijo...and who
they were after!

47:29.681 --> 47:32.398
We must be careful!

47:32.399 --> 47:35.116
If the Los Muertos law is out to
get us, finding mamá may not be

47:35.119 --> 47:39.055
as easy as doing one
more good deed!

47:40.825 --> 47:41.791
Ayuda!

47:41.793 --> 47:43.576
Ayuda!

47:43.577 --> 47:45.360
Por favor! Please, help me!

47:45.363 --> 47:46.429
Whoa!

47:46.664 --> 47:47.730
Are you okay, miss?

47:47.732 --> 47:49.432
What is going on?

47:50.168 --> 47:50.967
Do you need help?

47:50.969 --> 47:52.702
If so, we're your men!

47:53.037 --> 47:55.571
We're looking to do a good deed!

47:55.573 --> 47:56.572
It's Paco!

47:56.574 --> 47:57.974
He's lost his cabeza!

47:57.976 --> 47:59.976
He's out of his mind!

47:59.978 --> 48:02.712
He destroyed mi casa,
and took off!

48:02.714 --> 48:04.513
Slow down, miss!

48:04.515 --> 48:05.514
Explain!

48:05.516 --> 48:07.483
Who is Paco?

48:07.485 --> 48:10.219
Paco es mi esposo!

48:10.221 --> 48:11.587
Who, papá?

48:11.589 --> 48:12.822
He's her husband!

48:12.824 --> 48:14.490
Like you and mamá?

48:14.492 --> 48:17.443
No, Chiqui.

48:17.444 --> 48:20.395
Something tells me these two are
NOTHING like me and your mamá!

48:20.398 --> 48:22.598
Where is Paco now, miss?

48:22.600 --> 48:23.599
Probably the saloon!

48:23.601 --> 48:25.301
Where he always
goes after he acts up!

48:25.837 --> 48:26.903
The saloon?!

48:27.405 --> 48:28.604
No way!

48:28.606 --> 48:30.172
We can't go back there, papá!

48:30.174 --> 48:32.008
I agree, Chiqui!

48:32.010 --> 48:33.743
That would be a bad idea!

48:33.745 --> 48:39.582
But, we can care for this nice
lady, to ensure that she remains
safe tonight!

48:39.584 --> 48:44.687
Paco, he will cause trouble at
the saloon, until they
throw him out!

48:44.689 --> 48:47.256
Then he'll return, angrier than
before!

48:47.258 --> 48:50.192
You don't want to meet
Paco like that, trust me!

48:50.194 --> 48:53.195
Miss, with all due respect...

48:53.197 --> 48:56.866
if it's a fight your
husband wants,

48:56.868 --> 49:00.369
then it's me he doesn't
want to meet!

49:00.371 --> 49:03.005
Come, Chiqui!

49:03.006 --> 49:05.640
Let's take this nice lady home
and heat some soup for her.

49:05.643 --> 49:10.146
We can rest our feet a
while...and wait for
Paco!

49:11.382 --> 49:16.719
So then, my mamá - who is the
most beautiful woman in all the
land under her mask, and

49:16.721 --> 49:22.625
a total superhero when her mask
is on - executed la perfecta
sunset-flip off the top rope!

49:22.961 --> 49:26.862
And she pinned
La Gargantua one, two, three!

49:27.098 --> 49:28.531
Right in the center of the ring!

49:28.900 --> 49:32.702
And became the NEW luchadora
champion of the universe!

49:33.137 --> 49:35.304
A title she holds
to this very day!

49:35.606 --> 49:36.672
Guau, Chiqui!

49:37.408 --> 49:39.475
Your mamá sounds
like quite the woman!

49:39.744 --> 49:42.244
That, she is, Mamá Lucia!

49:42.246 --> 49:48.818
My wonderful Julieta is the most
amazing marvel
of a woman who ever was!

49:48.820 --> 49:55.858
It was only because she shined
so vibrantly, that I agreed to
let her travel here, into

49:55.860 --> 49:59.862
the darkness, to shed
more light for all!

49:59.864 --> 50:02.865
That was a risky move,
Papa Diego!

50:02.867 --> 50:06.035
Many a soul has lost their way,
here in The Beyond!

50:06.437 --> 50:10.172
I am sad to say...that I
am one of them.

50:10.174 --> 50:12.224
You?!

50:12.225 --> 50:14.275
But, you seem like a perfectly
nice lady, Mamá Lucia!

50:14.278 --> 50:15.311
With a nice home!

50:15.313 --> 50:16.812
And a nice attitude!

50:16.814 --> 50:19.281
Appearances can
deceive, little one!

50:19.283 --> 50:23.185
I was bright-eyed and full of
life when I arrived in
Los Muertes -

50:23.187 --> 50:25.421
even though I had passed on!

50:25.890 --> 50:31.627
An accident took me from my old
world - YOUR world - to this
one!

50:31.629 --> 50:36.298
But, like so many who came
before me, I had yet to
realize it!

50:36.300 --> 50:42.405
I simply believed I had woken up
in this strange
place from a deep, deep slumber!

50:42.407 --> 50:46.142
You mean, no one told you
that you were...dead?

50:46.144 --> 50:47.643
No, Chiqui.

50:47.645 --> 50:50.312
They let you find that
out for yourself.

50:50.314 --> 50:56.318
How you deal with the news is up
to you, and decides where you
fall in the social structure

50:56.320 --> 51:00.456
of The Beyond!

51:00.457 --> 51:04.593
I'm afraid I didn't handle it
well - I missed my own mamá
terribly - and so, I met

51:04.595 --> 51:06.929
one who also
wasn't adjusting well!

51:06.931 --> 51:07.997
Paco.

51:07.999 --> 51:09.932
Sí, Paco.

51:09.934 --> 51:12.935
He only recently accepted his
new life here.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.838
And still harbors much
resentment, at that!

51:15.840 --> 51:18.874
He wishes he were
still among the living.

51:18.876 --> 51:22.011
And I'm often made
the brunt of his anger.

51:22.013 --> 51:23.079
His anger?

51:23.347 --> 51:26.115
Yes, he can be quite angry
sometimes!

51:26.117 --> 51:27.550
He just...

51:27.552 --> 51:32.188
Hasn't adjusted well to the
Great Beyond, you see...

51:32.190 --> 51:34.390
That is no excuse, Mamá Lucia.

51:34.392 --> 51:41.030
Sí, I know...but, without me, I
fear Paco would be
completely lost!

51:41.032 --> 51:44.533
He would wander the Wasteland,
and probably end up

51:44.535 --> 51:47.303
taking Momo's hand
and being led away!

51:47.305 --> 51:48.304
Momo?!

51:48.306 --> 51:50.706
Oh, no, no, no!

51:50.708 --> 51:56.979
Aye...many a good man - and
woman too - has been led astray
by Momo's promises!

51:56.981 --> 51:58.814
Never to be seen again!

51:58.816 --> 52:04.487
Mamá Lucia, if you'll let me,
I'd like to have a word with
Paco, when he returns.

52:04.489 --> 52:05.688
Yes you may.

52:05.923 --> 52:08.891
But, realize that, depending
on his temperament

52:08.893 --> 52:11.827
this evening, he may not be
receptive to words.

52:11.829 --> 52:12.895
I know.

52:12.897 --> 52:17.466
But, I have a way of making
things clear to angry men.

52:17.468 --> 52:19.068
Ha! I'll say, papá!

52:19.070 --> 52:21.670
Shh! He's back!

52:23.608 --> 52:24.673
Ehh?

52:25.143 --> 52:27.376
¿Quiénes son
estos invitados, mamá?

52:28.079 --> 52:30.679
These are my new friends, Paco!

52:30.681 --> 52:32.214
This is Papa Diego!

52:32.583 --> 52:34.750
And his little chico, Chiqui!

52:34.752 --> 52:35.818
Mmm...

52:37.488 --> 52:38.487
Hi, Paco!

52:38.489 --> 52:40.923
What do you strangers want?

52:40.925 --> 52:41.924
A word.

52:41.926 --> 52:43.993
Say your peace, amigos.

52:44.295 --> 52:45.294
I'm listening.

52:45.296 --> 52:48.330
I have all the time in the...

52:48.332 --> 52:49.698
Underworld!

52:49.834 --> 52:53.836
Mamá Lucia is a good woman,
doing her best in The Beyond.

52:54.005 --> 52:58.807
She deserves one who also
strives to be the best
he can be.

52:58.809 --> 53:02.278
If it is not you, then you need
to let her be.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.345
Mamá?

53:03.648 --> 53:04.713
What say you?

53:05.950 --> 53:09.118
I want to give you every chance
to share this new life with me,

53:09.120 --> 53:11.187
Paco...but I'm not sure
you want it.

53:11.622 --> 53:13.055
Oh, mamá!

53:13.324 --> 53:14.723
Lo siento!

53:14.725 --> 53:16.859
I never meant to hurt you!

53:16.861 --> 53:18.794
Forgive me, mamá!

53:18.796 --> 53:20.296
Take me back!

53:20.298 --> 53:21.463
Oh, Paco!

53:21.465 --> 53:23.666
I never threw you away!

53:23.668 --> 53:26.969
I have seen the
error of my ways.

53:26.971 --> 53:28.737
You make death
worth living.

53:29.173 --> 53:30.706
May I have another chance?

53:31.309 --> 53:32.441
Of course, you may!

53:32.910 --> 53:34.043
Oh, Paco!

53:34.045 --> 53:36.445
You silly fool, you!

53:36.814 --> 53:37.913
Well, mijo.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.615
Our work is done here!

53:40.184 --> 53:41.817
Is this another
good deed, papá?!

53:41.819 --> 53:43.752
Will this grant us
entry to the festivale?!

53:44.422 --> 53:46.388
I believe, so, mi hijo.

53:46.390 --> 53:47.990
I do believe so.

53:48.226 --> 53:49.225
Come!

53:49.227 --> 53:52.394
Let's see if El Monstruo
feels the same way!

53:52.396 --> 53:54.363
Farewell, Mamá Lucia!

53:54.365 --> 53:55.431
Paco!

53:55.433 --> 53:57.066
Be happy!

53:57.068 --> 53:58.734
You too, Papa Diego!

53:58.736 --> 54:00.436
And you, Chiqui!

54:00.438 --> 54:02.605
It was nice meeting you both!

54:02.607 --> 54:05.574
Buena suerte finding tu mamá!

54:05.576 --> 54:06.675
Gracias, Mamá Lucia!

54:06.677 --> 54:07.676
Buenas noches!

54:07.678 --> 54:08.677
Buenas noches!

54:08.679 --> 54:09.745
Buenas noches!

54:09.747 --> 54:14.850
I told ya we shouldn'ta gotten
into a sing-off with
Erasma, kid!

54:15.086 --> 54:17.820
We played right into her trap!

54:18.055 --> 54:20.856
Oh, don't you see, Fredo?

54:20.858 --> 54:23.225
She would've gotten us
one way, or another!

54:23.227 --> 54:24.660
We were targeted!

54:25.129 --> 54:28.364
She'd set out to eliminate us
from the start!

54:28.366 --> 54:30.132
But, why?!

54:30.568 --> 54:32.801
Competition's the spice o'
victory!

54:33.137 --> 54:37.806
What good's winnin', if ya don't
beat the best o' the best?!

54:37.808 --> 54:43.412
Maybe after ten thousand years
of winning, Erasma doesn't ever
want to risk losing!

54:43.414 --> 54:44.480
Ah, phooey!

54:44.482 --> 54:50.919
Sounds like a lotta hogwash -
and sounds like
one crummy title reign to me!

54:50.921 --> 54:52.154
Me, too!

54:52.156 --> 54:58.360
I came here two years ago to
earn my place in the pantheon of
greats...now, my dream

54:58.596 --> 55:00.296
is destroyed!

55:00.631 --> 55:06.335
I've brought nothing but shame
upon mi casa...and
mi familia is lost forever.

55:06.337 --> 55:07.136
Hey!

55:07.405 --> 55:10.072
Don't talk like that, Beyondé!

55:10.074 --> 55:12.141
My name's Julieta, Fredo.

55:12.343 --> 55:16.112
No more Beyondé.

55:16.113 --> 55:19.882
Just Julieta, bad mother,
disappointing wife, wanna-be
singer, total failure!

55:20.584 --> 55:22.951
Don't say them things, kid!

55:22.953 --> 55:24.953
It ain't over 'til it's over!

55:24.955 --> 55:26.689
We can make a comeback!

55:26.691 --> 55:28.757
We can still win this thing!

55:28.759 --> 55:29.758
Oh, yeah?

55:29.760 --> 55:30.693
How?

55:30.695 --> 55:32.094
Look around us, Fredo.

55:33.097 --> 55:35.264
We're in the Wasteland!

55:35.266 --> 55:36.999
NOBODY comes back
from the Wasteland!

55:37.601 --> 55:40.002
Hola, lost souls.

55:40.004 --> 55:40.836
AHH!

55:41.038 --> 55:42.805
What's that?!

55:42.807 --> 55:47.643
I am Momo - your guide,
if you will allow it.

55:47.645 --> 55:50.946
Dios mío, es el temido Momo!

55:51.315 --> 55:52.781
Stay calm, Fredo!

55:52.783 --> 55:54.116
I'll handle this!

55:54.118 --> 55:55.117
How?

55:55.119 --> 55:57.519
Momo took away
my Uncle Giuseppe!

55:57.521 --> 55:59.822
Well, I'm not afraid!

55:59.824 --> 56:05.194
Ah, your Uncle Giuseppe...I
remember him well.

56:05.196 --> 56:08.464
Led him to the
River Styx, I did.

56:08.466 --> 56:10.032
I knew it!

56:10.034 --> 56:12.000
Momo, we're just
passing through!

56:12.002 --> 56:14.970
Everyone's just passing through.

56:15.172 --> 56:17.373
Thank you for watching
over our journey, espectro!

56:17.675 --> 56:20.809
Your eternal vigilance es muy
appreciada!

56:21.045 --> 56:28.317
I can do much more than watch
over you, voyagers...if
you only take my hand.

56:29.019 --> 56:34.089
Mi Grandpapa Ernesto used to
tell me stories 'bout Momo

56:34.091 --> 56:37.326
comin' to get us,
when we was little!

56:37.328 --> 56:39.661
Now, here he is!

56:39.663 --> 56:42.297
It's ike a prophecy fulfilled!

56:43.601 --> 56:46.168
Boy, oh, boy!

56:46.170 --> 56:49.338
Please, don't let Momo take me!

56:49.840 --> 56:51.006
Fear not my friends...

56:51.008 --> 56:57.479
Just take my hand and
follow me into the fog...

56:58.416 --> 57:01.183
Okay, look!

57:01.184 --> 57:03.951
I dunno what kind of racket
you've got going on around here,
but neither of us are taking

57:04.188 --> 57:07.055
your hand, and you're not taking
either of us away!

57:07.057 --> 57:08.123
Got it?!

57:08.125 --> 57:13.862
We have a very important
engagement to make, and I'm not
gonna miss it for the world!

57:13.864 --> 57:15.531
OR The Beyond!

57:15.533 --> 57:17.399
So, move on, wraith!

57:17.401 --> 57:19.368
Or face my wrath!

57:19.370 --> 57:21.270
So forceful.

57:21.272 --> 57:23.705
You ain't seen nothing yet,
ghost boy!

57:23.707 --> 57:26.875
Oh, please, oh please!

57:27.578 --> 57:30.612
You need only take
my hand, old mummy.

57:30.614 --> 57:33.649
And your fear will
cease.

57:33.651 --> 57:34.983
That's it!

57:34.985 --> 57:37.519
I warned you!

57:37.955 --> 57:40.222
(harmonizing)

57:40.224 --> 57:44.927
Ow...that hurts...my skull can't
take high pitches...

57:44.929 --> 57:46.829
(harmonizing)

57:46.831 --> 57:49.598
Ow...ow...ow!

57:49.600 --> 57:51.400
(harmonizing)

57:51.402 --> 57:53.335
Hey!

57:53.571 --> 57:54.503
Ya did it!

57:54.505 --> 57:55.971
Momo split!

57:56.240 --> 58:00.943
And ya made him flee using
nothin' but your voice!

58:00.945 --> 58:06.248
Yeah, well...hopefully, it
doesn't have the
same effect on judges!

58:06.250 --> 58:07.516
Gracias, Beyondé!

58:07.952 --> 58:10.519
I am forever in your debt!

58:10.821 --> 58:13.989
But, I'm already
in yours, Fredo.

58:13.991 --> 58:14.990
Just paying it back.

58:15.459 --> 58:17.759
And call me Julieta, okay?

58:17.761 --> 58:20.929
Let's leave Beyondé
on the stage.

58:20.931 --> 58:24.433
Sure thing, Bey--er, Julieta!

58:24.435 --> 58:25.267
C'mon!

58:25.269 --> 58:28.103
Let's find our way back to town!

58:28.105 --> 58:32.241
I have no intention of letting
that old crone,
Erasma, run us off!

58:32.810 --> 58:35.611
Her little scheme's gonna
backfire!

58:35.613 --> 58:38.947
And I'm gonna be crowned the
Greatest Singer Beyond
the Beyond...

58:38.949 --> 58:41.683
even if it kills me!

58:41.685 --> 58:46.054
Uhh, hehe...be careful whatcha
say here, kid.

58:46.056 --> 58:48.056
Things're listenin'!

58:48.692 --> 58:51.894
I can't believe what happened
back there
in the saloon, Henderson!

58:51.896 --> 58:54.796
Why, if I was half the
man I used to be...

58:54.798 --> 58:56.798
We'll find 'em, Spiff!

58:56.800 --> 58:58.567
Don't you worry!

58:58.569 --> 59:04.206
And when I get my bony fingers
'round that big fella's neck,
why, I'ma gonna--

59:04.208 --> 59:06.041
Where we gonna find
'em's the problem?

59:06.043 --> 59:08.877
They're for sure layin' low now!

59:08.879 --> 59:13.649
Ain't nobody dumb enough to make
a scene like that an' just
stroll off, with their

59:13.651 --> 59:16.402
spurs a-jinglin'!

59:16.403 --> 59:19.154
Well, that's purdy much exactly
what they did, Spiff!

59:19.156 --> 59:23.825
That big, ugly goon defeated up
in front of the whole dang
saloon!

59:23.827 --> 59:28.497
Now, it's only a matter o' time
before word gets back to
Sheriff Tato!

59:28.499 --> 59:34.002
Yeah...unless we find them two
first, haul 'em in, an' hang 'em

59:34.004 --> 59:37.906
up by their boot heels, before
that there gossip mill
gets goin'!

59:37.908 --> 59:40.175
I like that plan, Spiff!

59:40.177 --> 59:41.677
I like it lots!

59:41.679 --> 59:44.680
We just gotta figure out where
they're hidin'!

59:44.682 --> 59:49.017
Right...Hey, if you was a
lowdown, dirty pollo like

59:49.019 --> 59:50.586
the both o' them,
and you knew a coupla

59:50.588 --> 59:56.925
straight-shootin' lawmen like us
was gunnin'
for ya, where would YOU hide?

59:57.528 --> 1:00:03.599
Hmm...there's only one place to
hide in 'at situation -
THE WASTELAND!

1:00:04.969 --> 1:00:06.034
Ya think?!

1:00:06.036 --> 1:00:06.935
I do!

1:00:06.937 --> 1:00:12.040
Lookit - it's foggy, it's far,
an' that creeper Momo's there to
run interference,

1:00:12.042 --> 1:00:14.042
if'n the law comes a-lookin'!

1:00:14.044 --> 1:00:15.377
Hot dang!

1:00:15.379 --> 1:00:16.378
Yer right!

1:00:16.380 --> 1:00:18.447
Let's go get 'em right now!

1:00:18.449 --> 1:00:21.950
We'll drag 'em kickin' an'
screamin' to the town jail!

1:00:21.952 --> 1:00:27.623
Then, Sheriff Tato'll name
us heroes 'fore this Dia of the
Dead's over!

1:00:27.625 --> 1:00:28.290
Deal!

1:00:28.292 --> 1:00:29.358
Wait...

1:00:29.960 --> 1:00:31.893
...which way's the Wasteland?

1:00:31.895 --> 1:00:33.095
Uhh...

1:00:33.097 --> 1:00:37.899
This way, I think...no, this
way...no, it's...

1:00:37.901 --> 1:00:44.172
It's 'round here someplace,
I know that!

1:00:44.174 --> 1:00:45.340
Forget it!

1:00:45.342 --> 1:00:46.508
We'll find it!

1:00:46.810 --> 1:00:48.443
An' we'll find THEM!

1:00:48.445 --> 1:00:49.511
Yeah!

1:00:50.781 --> 1:00:52.247
Stay close, Chiqui.

1:00:52.249 --> 1:00:57.252
This area is treacherous, and
El Monstruo may be in hiding!

1:00:57.254 --> 1:01:01.623
But, Papa...what if El Monstruo
doesn't know
we're here looking for mamá?

1:01:01.625 --> 1:01:03.425
Disparates!

1:01:03.427 --> 1:01:09.264
The all-seeing, all-knowing El
Monstruo will feel our desires,
and know that we performed

1:01:09.266 --> 1:01:13.702
the two good deeds tradicional
required to be granted our wish!

1:01:13.704 --> 1:01:18.473
He will not leave us without an
answer, Chiqui,
that much I know!

1:01:18.475 --> 1:01:20.308
¿Quien va alla?

1:01:20.310 --> 1:01:21.376
Papa!

1:01:21.512 --> 1:01:22.511
Was that you?!

1:01:22.513 --> 1:01:24.513
No, mijo. It was not I!

1:01:24.515 --> 1:01:26.381
It sounded like--

1:01:26.984 --> 1:01:28.617
--EL MONSTRUO!

1:01:28.886 --> 1:01:29.618
Sí!

1:01:29.620 --> 1:01:36.024
Tell me, intrusos...why do you
seek entry into the
Festivale De Los Muertos?

1:01:36.727 --> 1:01:38.627
It's mi mamá, Senor Monstruo!

1:01:38.629 --> 1:01:39.761
Tu madre?

1:01:39.997 --> 1:01:41.063
Sí!

1:01:41.065 --> 1:01:43.265
Allow me to introduce us!

1:01:43.701 --> 1:01:48.470
Mi nombre es Papa Diego,
y this is mi hijo, Chiqui!

1:01:48.472 --> 1:01:54.509
Mi mamá, Julieta, came to The
Beyond to compete
in the...what is it again, papá?

1:01:54.511 --> 1:01:57.879
The Greatest Singer Beyond the
Beyond competition!

1:01:58.382 --> 1:01:59.514
Sí, that!

1:01:59.516 --> 1:02:01.817
We're here to cheer her
onstage--and, well,

1:02:01.819 --> 1:02:05.153
she asked me to come be
part of her performance!

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:09.991
We know it's frowned upon for
the living to mingle with the
dead any other time of

1:02:09.993 --> 1:02:11.660
year, El Monstruo!

1:02:11.662 --> 1:02:15.397
But, we also know that
today es muy especiale!

1:02:16.900 --> 1:02:18.333
Sí, muy!

1:02:18.335 --> 1:02:22.137
Little Chiqui hasn't seen his
mamá in two years now.

1:02:22.439 --> 1:02:25.941
And likewise, I haven't
seen mi esposa.

1:02:25.943 --> 1:02:27.275
We miss her terribly.

1:02:27.277 --> 1:02:29.010
And, if she wins this evening--

1:02:29.012 --> 1:02:31.680
She'll finally be
able to come back home!

1:02:31.682 --> 1:02:36.852
Sí, that es la tradicion... but,
there is another part of it,

1:02:36.854 --> 1:02:39.855
that I am not sure
you're aware of!

1:02:40.090 --> 1:02:42.691
Eh? There is?

1:02:42.693 --> 1:02:44.860
Sí.

1:02:44.861 --> 1:02:47.028
While it is true, a victory
would enable your wife and

1:02:47.030 --> 1:02:49.931
mother to return
home with you...

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:56.271
a defeat would mean that she
cannot leave The Beyond...ever!

1:02:57.207 --> 1:02:57.973
Ever?

1:02:58.408 --> 1:02:59.775
Never.

1:03:00.043 --> 1:03:01.076
Oh, no!

1:03:01.078 --> 1:03:02.043
Papa!

1:03:02.045 --> 1:03:03.845
We could lose mamá forever?!

1:03:04.214 --> 1:03:06.114
I-I did not know this.

1:03:06.650 --> 1:03:07.716
Many do not.

1:03:07.718 --> 1:03:13.822
It's in the fine print of the
crossover
manual, on page 46.

1:03:14.558 --> 1:03:16.291
There's a manual?!

1:03:16.794 --> 1:03:18.660
Sí, there is.

1:03:19.229 --> 1:03:20.128
Nobody told us!

1:03:20.731 --> 1:03:23.465
Don't feel bad,
you're not the only one.

1:03:23.567 --> 1:03:26.501
I have this conversation often.

1:03:27.237 --> 1:03:32.908
If you do review the manual, I
also suggest you see page 47,

1:03:32.910 --> 1:03:35.744
which details a hack to WINNING

1:03:35.746 --> 1:03:40.248
the Greatest Singer Beyond the
Beyond competition!

1:03:40.250 --> 1:03:41.316
A hack?!

1:03:41.451 --> 1:03:42.517
I love hacking!

1:03:42.653 --> 1:03:43.985
And I love winning!

1:03:44.454 --> 1:03:46.588
Can you tell us
about this hack, El

1:03:46.590 --> 1:03:47.656
Monstruo?

1:03:47.858 --> 1:03:48.924
I will!

1:03:48.926 --> 1:03:55.964
It says that any singer who is
accompanied by a partner who
dances hard enough, dances

1:03:55.966 --> 1:04:02.838
like their life depends on it -
which, of course, it does -
shall summon the power of

1:04:02.840 --> 1:04:06.541
the ancient Gods of the Beyond!

1:04:07.211 --> 1:04:09.211
Gods of the Beyond?

1:04:09.213 --> 1:04:12.113
And, with the power of the
ancients possessing

1:04:12.115 --> 1:04:16.017
their limbs and vocal chords,
these contestants

1:04:16.019 --> 1:04:21.189
will be unstoppable in the eyes
of the judges,
dead and undead!

1:04:21.959 --> 1:04:26.394
Victory, it is written,
shall be theirs!

1:04:26.396 --> 1:04:31.967
Whoaaa... so, if I dance with
mamá, like she asked papá in his
dream...she'll win!

1:04:31.969 --> 1:04:35.170
El Monstruo, may we please enter
the festivale and find mi mamá?

1:04:35.172 --> 1:04:36.471
Please?!

1:04:36.473 --> 1:04:41.309
There are many reasons by which
the living pursue The Beyond,

1:04:41.311 --> 1:04:48.550
as I am sure there is a
reason your mamá parted ways
with her loving family.

1:04:48.886 --> 1:04:50.886
Trust me, I hear them all.

1:04:51.021 --> 1:04:56.658
But, my favorite,
far and away, es amor!

1:04:56.660 --> 1:04:57.659
Amor?

1:04:57.661 --> 1:05:01.363
Love, Chiqui.

1:05:01.364 --> 1:05:05.066
The reason behind every step
we've made, since the
moment we left our casa!

1:05:05.068 --> 1:05:07.068
Sí, amor.

1:05:07.070 --> 1:05:08.603
I see it in your eyes.

1:05:08.605 --> 1:05:11.907
Hear it in your voices.

1:05:11.909 --> 1:05:13.341
Ohh!

1:05:13.343 --> 1:05:16.845
Love is the noblest of reasons
one would seek to pass into

1:05:16.847 --> 1:05:21.616
The Beyond, while still
drawing warm breath here!

1:05:22.019 --> 1:05:24.419
Love drives us!

1:05:24.421 --> 1:05:25.820
Inspires us!

1:05:26.290 --> 1:05:29.624
Enables us to climb
heights undreamt of!

1:05:30.460 --> 1:05:32.727
Cross the deepest seas!

1:05:32.729 --> 1:05:35.697
Brave the most raging fires!

1:05:35.966 --> 1:05:40.201
It is the sole reason we stand
before you, El Monstruo.

1:05:40.203 --> 1:05:42.103
I love my wife.

1:05:42.539 --> 1:05:47.375
And her little one here loves
her even more,
if that's possible.

1:05:47.377 --> 1:05:53.315
In love, luchador, ALL things
are made possible

1:05:53.317 --> 1:05:58.787
- such as, your entry
into Los Muertos!

1:05:58.789 --> 1:05:59.854
Papa!

1:06:00.557 --> 1:06:03.124
I think he means--
I think he does too, mijo!

1:06:03.126 --> 1:06:07.395
I mean, not to be presumptuous,
Senor Monstruo.

1:06:07.831 --> 1:06:08.897
Mucho respeto.

1:06:09.399 --> 1:06:10.465
Gracias, senor.

1:06:11.568 --> 1:06:15.337
This woman you pursue is very
brave to stand and face

1:06:15.339 --> 1:06:19.607
Erasma Bones in her own realm.

1:06:19.609 --> 1:06:23.979
She will need all that bravery,
and then some.

1:06:24.247 --> 1:06:26.214
Best wishes, to all three of
you.

1:06:26.917 --> 1:06:32.654
You may enter Los Muertos.

1:06:32.656 --> 1:06:33.421
Really?!

1:06:33.423 --> 1:06:34.422
Papa!

1:06:34.424 --> 1:06:35.857
We can go in!
We can go in!

1:06:36.326 --> 1:06:37.759
Sí, mijo!

1:06:37.761 --> 1:06:39.311
Sí!

1:06:39.312 --> 1:06:40.862
Muchísimas gracias,
Senor Monstruo!

1:06:40.864 --> 1:06:44.165
There is no time to waste,
caballeros!

1:06:44.534 --> 1:06:45.834
Go now!

1:06:45.836 --> 1:06:46.668
And find your love!

1:06:48.105 --> 1:06:49.170
Bueno!

1:06:49.473 --> 1:06:50.705
Come, papá! Hurry!

1:06:50.707 --> 1:06:52.607
Wait for me, Chiqui!

1:06:52.609 --> 1:06:56.277
Senor Monstruo, we cannot
thank you enough!

1:06:56.279 --> 1:07:03.451
Thank me by finding that woman,
returning her to your realm, and
living happily ever

1:07:03.453 --> 1:07:04.452
after!

1:07:04.454 --> 1:07:06.521
The clock is ticking, luchador!

1:07:06.957 --> 1:07:07.856
Right!

1:07:07.858 --> 1:07:09.257
Adios, amigo!

1:07:10.060 --> 1:07:11.760
I'm coming, Chiqui!

1:07:12.295 --> 1:07:14.529
Easy, niño, easy!

1:07:16.033 --> 1:07:22.303
On behalf of my beloved llama,
Tomás, I'd like to welcome you
all to another Greatest

1:07:22.305 --> 1:07:26.408
Singer Beyond the Beyond
competition!

1:07:26.410 --> 1:07:34.049
Where the best of the best vie
for the coveted
title of Greatest Singer Ever!

1:07:35.585 --> 1:07:40.155
As you're all aware, for the
past ten thousand years,

1:07:40.157 --> 1:07:46.961
we have had ONE dominant
champion - Erasma Bones!

1:07:49.166 --> 1:07:53.101
Sí, sí, she's amazing,
isn't she?

1:07:53.370 --> 1:07:55.470
Truly amazing!

1:07:57.174 --> 1:08:04.813
And, well, it looks like there
won't be an upset this year,
either - since NOBODY

1:08:05.015 --> 1:08:07.182
else has entered the contest!

1:08:09.019 --> 1:08:16.691
Therefore, before we present the
title of Greatest Singer Beyond
the Beyond to Erasma

1:08:16.693 --> 1:08:24.599
yet again, she's going to grace
us all with a solo performance
for the ages!

1:08:25.769 --> 1:08:31.773
Everybody hang tight, while our
diva originale gets ready!

1:08:32.442 --> 1:08:36.144
And in a very short while,
prepare to put

1:08:36.146 --> 1:08:40.548
those bones together for the
legend herself

1:08:40.550 --> 1:08:44.285
- Erasma Bones!

1:08:46.490 --> 1:08:48.289
This is it, kid!

1:08:48.291 --> 1:08:51.559
Everything we been workin'
toward for the
past two years!

1:08:52.395 --> 1:08:53.895
Two years!

1:08:54.931 --> 1:08:55.997
And you're ready!

1:08:56.166 --> 1:08:59.567
I ain't never seen a
singer more ready!

1:08:59.569 --> 1:09:05.240
We gotta getcha signed up, then
I wantcha to go up there, an'
show the Beyond what you're

1:09:05.242 --> 1:09:06.341
made of!

1:09:06.810 --> 1:09:09.144
Let it rip, Beyondé!

1:09:09.146 --> 1:09:10.678
Okay!

1:09:10.680 --> 1:09:16.251
But, you know, Fredo...I'm not
so sure about
this Beyondé thing, after all.

1:09:16.253 --> 1:09:18.253
Eh, you're right!

1:09:18.255 --> 1:09:20.255
It tries too hard!

1:09:20.257 --> 1:09:21.923
Julieta, it is!

1:09:22.325 --> 1:09:24.492
C'mon, we're almost there!

1:09:25.762 --> 1:09:27.762
I don't like this, Henderson!

1:09:27.764 --> 1:09:29.731
I don't like it so
much neither, Spiff!

1:09:30.267 --> 1:09:33.134
This Wasteland's
one creepy zona!

1:09:33.136 --> 1:09:34.135
Pfft!

1:09:34.137 --> 1:09:35.870
What are ya, scared?

1:09:35.872 --> 1:09:36.538
Huh?

1:09:36.540 --> 1:09:37.205
Me?

1:09:37.207 --> 1:09:38.273
Hmph!

1:09:38.441 --> 1:09:39.507
I ain't no pollo!

1:09:39.509 --> 1:09:43.811
Sounds like yer 'bout to wet yer
pantalones, hombre!

1:09:43.813 --> 1:09:44.879
Me?!

1:09:45.182 --> 1:09:48.116
You're the one shakin' like a
leaf over there!

1:09:48.118 --> 1:09:52.053
I'm shakin' 'cause I'm brimmin'
with righteous rage, hombre!

1:09:52.055 --> 1:09:53.621
Not 'cause I'm scared!

1:09:53.623 --> 1:09:54.689
Uh-huh.

1:09:54.891 --> 1:09:56.891
We'll see 'bout that.

1:09:56.893 --> 1:09:58.860
¡Bienvenidos, hombres muertos!

1:09:59.796 --> 1:10:01.696
(screams)

1:10:01.698 --> 1:10:02.964
It's him!

1:10:02.966 --> 1:10:04.199
It's Momo!

1:10:04.201 --> 1:10:06.134
Don't look at 'im!

1:10:06.136 --> 1:10:07.702
Don't talk to 'im!

1:10:07.704 --> 1:10:09.137
Maybe he'll go away!

1:10:09.139 --> 1:10:10.305
Go away?

1:10:10.307 --> 1:10:13.675
But, only if we can
go together, dears.

1:10:13.677 --> 1:10:16.211
Don't fear the reaper.

1:10:16.746 --> 1:10:18.313
Come...take my hand.

1:10:18.515 --> 1:10:20.248
We'll be able to fly.

1:10:20.250 --> 1:10:21.983
I'm your friend.

1:10:21.985 --> 1:10:23.384
Run!

1:10:23.587 --> 1:10:27.088
Go, go, go!

1:10:27.090 --> 1:10:29.157
(screams)

1:10:33.897 --> 1:10:36.064
Mwahahahaha!

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:38.533
Alright, everybody!

1:10:38.535 --> 1:10:40.034
This is it!

1:10:40.036 --> 1:10:43.605
The moment we've
all been waiting for!

1:10:43.907 --> 1:10:47.075
The Madame of Stardom!

1:10:47.277 --> 1:10:48.977
The Queen of Mean!

1:10:49.546 --> 1:10:51.813
The Best Dame in the Game!

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:58.019
Lemme hear those bones rattle
for the one, the only...

1:10:58.021 --> 1:11:04.192
ERASMAAAA BOOOONES!

1:11:04.194 --> 1:11:07.795
Well, I wish I could say it's
nice to be
back here on this stage!

1:11:08.531 --> 1:11:11.432
Alas, the pleasure's all yours!

1:11:12.202 --> 1:11:13.268
Lola!

1:11:13.737 --> 1:11:15.436
Hit my music!

1:11:41.898 --> 1:11:42.697
She's great.

1:11:43.133 --> 1:11:44.232
You're better.

1:11:44.567 --> 1:11:45.633
You think so?

1:11:45.635 --> 1:11:47.435
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

1:11:47.437 --> 1:11:49.370
You're like the
padre I never had.

1:11:49.673 --> 1:11:55.143
If ya need me to say it out
loud, kid, you're
like the daughter I never had.

1:11:55.445 --> 1:11:56.577
Oh, Fredo!

1:11:56.746 --> 1:11:57.912
You old mummy!

1:11:57.914 --> 1:12:00.982
Yeah, yeah, hang on a sec...

1:12:00.984 --> 1:12:02.250
Yo, Leo!

1:12:02.585 --> 1:12:04.919
Got one more contestant
here for the show!

1:12:04.921 --> 1:12:08.489
Can she go on after Erasma's
done?

1:12:15.165 --> 1:12:17.932
Her name's JULIETA!

1:12:18.268 --> 1:12:20.501
Okay, Julieta!

1:12:21.104 --> 1:12:22.170
You're up next!

1:12:23.139 --> 1:12:23.938
Break a leg!

1:12:24.607 --> 1:12:25.840
What's wrong, kid?

1:12:26.009 --> 1:12:29.944
My baby Chiqui's not here to
dance with me, Fredo.

1:12:29.946 --> 1:12:33.481
Part of my dream was to
have him by my side.

1:12:33.483 --> 1:12:34.549
I get it.

1:12:34.551 --> 1:12:38.453
But, we can't always have
everything we want, y'know?

1:12:39.456 --> 1:12:42.290
I know...I was really just
hoping to see mi familia

1:12:42.292 --> 1:12:46.394
tonight...I'll be alright,
don't worry.

1:12:46.396 --> 1:12:48.296
Worried, I ain't!

1:12:48.298 --> 1:12:50.732
One more thing, kid.

1:12:50.734 --> 1:12:51.733
Yes?

1:12:51.735 --> 1:12:53.568
KNOCK 'EM DEAD!

1:12:53.570 --> 1:12:55.536
I think I see the stage from
here, papá!

1:12:55.538 --> 1:12:58.072
I hope we didn't miss
mama's performance!

1:12:58.074 --> 1:12:59.640
We haven't missed her!

1:12:59.642 --> 1:13:01.642
She won't go on
without you, mijo!

1:13:01.644 --> 1:13:02.744
Come!

1:13:02.746 --> 1:13:03.811
She's here somewhere!

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:05.279
Let us find her!

1:13:05.815 --> 1:13:06.881
Okay!

1:13:18.995 --> 1:13:23.831
The one and only
Erasma Bones, everybody.

1:13:24.434 --> 1:13:27.001
The ten thousand year champ.

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:29.737
Let's hear it for her.

1:13:30.273 --> 1:13:35.176
Woooo!  Ok, now!

1:13:35.178 --> 1:13:39.914
Ok, now. If I may have your
attention. Attention, please!

1:13:40.850 --> 1:13:44.719
I know I said there were no
contestants this year,

1:13:44.721 --> 1:13:48.189
but as fate would have it,
I was approached

1:13:48.191 --> 1:13:53.895
backstage by a young
lady who asked to sing!

1:13:53.897 --> 1:13:58.633
So, without further ado,
here she is!

1:13:59.102 --> 1:14:05.106
Put 'em together for lovely
JULIETA!

1:14:06.776 --> 1:14:07.775
What?!

1:14:07.944 --> 1:14:10.111
What is she doing here, Lola?!

1:14:10.547 --> 1:14:13.281
I thought I told you to make
them disappear!

1:14:13.283 --> 1:14:14.449
I did, Erasma!

1:14:14.651 --> 1:14:17.452
I chased them out into the
Wasteland!

1:14:17.587 --> 1:14:21.055
NOBODY comes back from the
Wasteland!

1:14:21.391 --> 1:14:26.227
Well obviously, we're dealing
with a special case...but,
no matter!

1:14:26.229 --> 1:14:27.195
This is MY crowd!

1:14:27.197 --> 1:14:34.135
They'll boo her offstage in no
time, and victory will once
again be mine, all mine!

1:14:35.572 --> 1:14:37.638
That's right... I hope!

1:14:40.577 --> 1:14:41.409
It's her, papá!

1:14:41.411 --> 1:14:42.310
It's mamá!

1:14:42.312 --> 1:14:48.249
Sí, Chiqui...she's even more
beautiful than
when I last laid eyes on her.

1:14:48.251 --> 1:14:50.751
She's breathtaking!

1:14:50.753 --> 1:14:53.287
Let her know we're here, papá!

1:14:53.289 --> 1:14:54.422
MAMA!

1:14:54.424 --> 1:14:55.323
Wait, mijo!

1:14:55.325 --> 1:14:56.624
She wants to speak.

1:14:56.626 --> 1:14:58.092
Let her.

1:14:58.428 --> 1:15:03.598
Hi...before I sing for you
tonight...I have a story to
tell.

1:15:03.600 --> 1:15:07.301
It's a quick story, don't
worry...I came to The Beyond

1:15:07.303 --> 1:15:09.937
from the other side
two years ago...I

1:15:09.939 --> 1:15:14.375
didn't die...I crossed over of
my own free will.

1:15:14.544 --> 1:15:22.517
I left behind the most beautiful
baby boy, and a loving
husband...they deserved better.

1:15:22.519 --> 1:15:26.687
But, all my life, I've been
blessed...sometimes,

1:15:26.689 --> 1:15:30.658
it feels like cursed...
with a skill I didn't

1:15:30.660 --> 1:15:32.527
choose and cannot control.

1:15:33.062 --> 1:15:36.797
And with a dream that refused to
remain still in my heart.

1:15:36.799 --> 1:15:42.703
I came to The Beyond to show
that skill, and to fulfill that
dream.

1:15:42.705 --> 1:15:45.806
And now, here I am.

1:15:45.808 --> 1:15:47.208
And there you are.

1:15:47.210 --> 1:15:48.276
And here goes nothing!

1:15:49.312 --> 1:15:49.977
Fredo!

1:15:49.979 --> 1:15:51.045
Music, please!

1:15:51.548 --> 1:15:53.648
I just wish my boy
Chiqui were here...

1:15:54.150 --> 1:15:55.216
Now, mijo!

1:15:55.752 --> 1:15:56.817
Go to her!

1:15:57.153 --> 1:15:58.719
Mamá! I'm here!

1:16:01.925 --> 1:16:02.990
Chiqui!

1:16:02.992 --> 1:16:04.158
Mi hijo!

1:16:04.694 --> 1:16:05.593
You came!

1:16:06.229 --> 1:16:07.395
Papa's here, too!

1:16:07.530 --> 1:16:08.963
He saw you in his dream!

1:16:09.165 --> 1:16:11.132
We came as fast
as we could, mamá!

1:16:11.367 --> 1:16:14.569
Oh, mi familia, mi amor, Chiqui!

1:16:14.771 --> 1:16:17.071
I love you, mamá!

1:16:18.107 --> 1:16:19.440
Need a dancer, while you sing?

1:16:19.609 --> 1:16:21.442
I thought you'd never ask!

1:16:21.878 --> 1:16:23.744
Follow my lead, baby!

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:24.845
Go get 'em, mamá!

1:16:25.114 --> 1:16:25.980
You can do it!

1:16:46.369 --> 1:16:48.336
She's got a dance partner?

1:16:48.871 --> 1:16:50.204
But, that's a duet!

1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:54.775
This isn't a couples show, it's
a solo performance!

1:16:55.378 --> 1:16:56.377
Solo!

1:16:57.880 --> 1:17:01.215
Oh, for crying out loud, will
you stop making
excuses and shut up already?

1:17:01.618 --> 1:17:02.683
Ingrata!

1:17:10.093 --> 1:17:12.059
We did it, mamá!
We did it!

1:17:12.061 --> 1:17:13.127
Woohoo!

1:17:26.442 --> 1:17:27.642
How'd you like THAT?

1:17:29.312 --> 1:17:32.513
Me too, hahaha! Alright!

1:17:33.583 --> 1:17:39.153
Well, it seems we had ourselves
a close race this year,
after all!

1:17:39.656 --> 1:17:41.822
On behalf of Tomás,

1:17:41.824 --> 1:17:49.430
I'd like to thank BOTH our
talented singers for showing
us what they're made of!

1:17:52.769 --> 1:17:54.736
Huh!

1:17:54.737 --> 1:17:56.704
I don't have to show anyone
what I'M made of!

1:17:56.706 --> 1:17:59.106
My legend precedes me!

1:17:59.342 --> 1:18:01.409
Talk about a nail-biter!

1:18:01.711 --> 1:18:05.913
The judging was close,
but the tallies are in!

1:18:06.182 --> 1:18:08.349
And the winner is...

1:18:23.566 --> 1:18:24.398
Hola, papá.

1:18:24.701 --> 1:18:25.766
Hola, mijo.

1:18:26.302 --> 1:18:27.301
How did you sleep?

1:18:27.303 --> 1:18:28.269
Fine.

1:18:29.205 --> 1:18:33.391
Whatcha doin'?

1:18:33.392 --> 1:18:37.578
I'm just organizing some of our
old familia memories in our
photo album.

1:18:37.814 --> 1:18:40.881
Oh...are you looking at
fotos of mamá?

1:18:40.883 --> 1:18:44.752
Sí...sí, I couldn't
help myself, mijo.

1:18:44.754 --> 1:18:47.088
She's radiant, my Julieta.

1:18:47.090 --> 1:18:53.260
Even on the page, I can't stop
staring...but,
enough dilly-dallying!

1:18:53.262 --> 1:18:58.432
I've got to make room for all of
her Greatest
Singer Beyond the Beyond fotos!

1:18:58.768 --> 1:19:02.169
Are you muchachos
STILL looking at my fotos?!

1:19:02.171 --> 1:19:05.172
Sí, sí!

1:19:05.173 --> 1:19:08.174
It's not every casa that has a
grand champion within its walls!

1:19:08.177 --> 1:19:11.879
I must chronicle your
career in the finest detail!

1:19:11.881 --> 1:19:13.114
Oh, puh-lease!

1:19:13.116 --> 1:19:16.183
That was TWO years ago!

1:19:16.185 --> 1:19:18.419
And I haven't toured
in over a year!

1:19:18.421 --> 1:19:23.491
I'm just a housewife now -
and a happy one, at that!

1:19:23.760 --> 1:19:25.860
We're happy to have
you back, mamá!

1:19:25.862 --> 1:19:27.728
Two years felt like forever,
when you were gone!

1:19:27.730 --> 1:19:31.532
And since you've been back with
us, it feels like yesterday when
you won that competition

1:19:31.534 --> 1:19:32.533
in The Beyond!

1:19:32.535 --> 1:19:33.968
Time flies, mijo!

1:19:33.970 --> 1:19:35.402
But, know this...

1:19:35.404 --> 1:19:38.539
Mamá got that craziness
out of her system.

1:19:38.541 --> 1:19:42.643
And she won't ever
leave you again, bueno?

1:19:42.645 --> 1:19:44.311
Either of you.

1:19:44.313 --> 1:19:46.046
But, mamá!

1:19:46.048 --> 1:19:49.717
If you ever DID wanna compete
again, I could dance beside you,
and we'd be victorious

1:19:49.719 --> 1:19:51.585
in every contest
we entered, no?!

1:19:51.587 --> 1:19:55.423
No!

1:19:55.424 --> 1:19:59.260
In fact, I'd be perfectly happy
if I NEVER visited The Beyond
again in mi vida!

1:19:59.262 --> 1:20:02.496
Only AFTER su vida,
right, Julieta?

1:20:02.498 --> 1:20:04.498
Very funny, Diego.

1:20:04.500 --> 1:20:05.800
Look, mamá!

1:20:05.802 --> 1:20:08.502
I've been working on
some new dance moves!

1:20:08.504 --> 1:20:11.772
Go, Chiqui, go Chiqui, go!

1:20:11.774 --> 1:20:12.907
Hahaha!

1:20:15.111 --> 1:20:17.745
Oh, mi vida loca!

1:20:17.747 --> 1:20:21.348
And I LOVE IT!
