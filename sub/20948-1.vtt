00:30.749 --> 00:34.718
[♪♪♪]

01:12.604 --> 01:14.337
Professor Fielding, we found something.

01:15.264 --> 01:17.030
Really?

01:17.316 --> 01:19.449
Oh... let's take a look.

01:22.776 --> 01:24.397
Oh...

01:25.194 --> 01:26.326
What do you think, Professor?

01:26.362 --> 01:27.928
What do you think?

01:32.538 --> 01:33.923
Kind of looks like...

01:34.470 --> 01:35.702
A spoon.

01:35.986 --> 01:37.298
Sure does.

01:37.314 --> 01:39.547
Please tell me it's English.

01:39.950 --> 01:41.316
It's English.

01:41.676 --> 01:42.609
Silver?

01:42.709 --> 01:44.458
Yep. definitely silver.

01:44.498 --> 01:46.999
And most importantly... How old?

01:47.904 --> 01:49.286
1700.

01:49.311 --> 01:50.811
Maybe 1710.

01:50.961 --> 01:51.994
[Everyone sighs]

01:52.019 --> 01:53.485
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:54.087 --> 01:55.227
We've only been here a week,

01:55.252 --> 01:57.860
and we've already found a
300-year-old artifact.

01:57.946 --> 01:59.178
Still a hundred years

01:59.214 --> 02:01.948
after the colony at
Jamestown was established.

02:01.983 --> 02:02.832
Okay, guys,

02:02.856 --> 02:04.824
if archaeology teaches us anything,

02:04.849 --> 02:06.496
it's patience.

02:07.153 --> 02:09.473
My father spent the last
25 years of his life

02:09.497 --> 02:11.096
looking for this lost colony.

02:11.132 --> 02:12.364
This spoon is a sign.

02:12.400 --> 02:16.034
It's flashing "you're close.
Keep digging."

02:16.051 --> 02:17.384
This is good news.

02:18.074 --> 02:19.173
Okay.

02:19.198 --> 02:20.964
Who wants to do the honors?

02:22.629 --> 02:23.561
Go ahead.

02:23.597 --> 02:24.729
[Giggling]

02:27.992 --> 02:29.892
[Emma]: Now that it's complete exposed,

02:29.927 --> 02:32.928
Carey can gently remove the artifact.

02:37.379 --> 02:38.311
[Emma]: Okay, now.

02:38.951 --> 02:40.950
Close your eyes.

02:40.975 --> 02:41.974
Know that you are

02:42.009 --> 02:44.716
the first person in three centuries

02:44.741 --> 02:45.940
to hold that spoon.

02:48.250 --> 02:50.550
Imagine the very
beginnings of a colony...

02:50.575 --> 02:52.065
The men clearing brush,

02:52.457 --> 02:54.870
surveying the land,
mapping the settlement...

02:54.895 --> 02:56.795
The women setting up an outdoor school

02:57.041 --> 02:59.675
and preserving food for
the coming winter.

03:01.533 --> 03:04.534
The last person who held
that lived and loved

03:04.559 --> 03:07.093
and felt suffering and joy.

03:07.428 --> 03:09.562
What you're holding in your hand

03:09.607 --> 03:11.741
is someone's life story.

03:11.986 --> 03:13.599
That's what we do! That's what we do.

03:13.635 --> 03:17.236
We find clues about
lives lived long ago.

03:17.272 --> 03:18.738
So let's keep digging!

03:18.773 --> 03:21.574
There are stories underground,
just waiting to be discovered.

03:57.092 --> 03:58.658
Hey, your mom showed me
around the other day.

03:58.694 --> 04:00.099
She has really good taste.

04:00.124 --> 04:01.423
Pauline's actually my step-mom,

04:02.178 --> 04:05.446
so, obviously, my dad
had good taste, too.

04:05.936 --> 04:08.404
Well, the first time I
saw Oscar Fielding,

04:08.428 --> 04:09.828
I was looking through my window,

04:09.863 --> 04:11.763
and I saw this strikingly handsome man

04:11.798 --> 04:12.597
wandering through my fields,

04:12.633 --> 04:13.565
carrying a shovel,

04:13.600 --> 04:16.034
and talking to himself
about a lost colony.

04:16.069 --> 04:17.903
I fell in love with him
right then and there.

04:17.938 --> 04:20.071
And now here you are, back in my field,

04:20.107 --> 04:21.640
continuing the work
that brought him here

04:21.675 --> 04:22.908
in the first place.

04:24.323 --> 04:25.622
So, any progress today?

04:26.313 --> 04:27.279
Getting closer.

04:27.314 --> 04:28.713
Oh, wow!

04:28.749 --> 04:29.714
[Emma]: Yeah!

04:29.750 --> 04:31.216
Would you please put
this in dad's old lab?

04:31.258 --> 04:32.557
I've got to get the kids back.

04:32.586 --> 04:33.885
Okay, I will.

04:33.921 --> 04:35.120
Thank you.

04:48.902 --> 04:51.303
'Kay, guys, don't forget
to update your notes,

04:51.338 --> 04:54.472
and, yes, they will count
when we get back to campus.

04:54.508 --> 04:56.107
You know, we would have
gotten to that spoon

04:56.143 --> 04:57.142
a lot sooner

04:57.177 --> 04:59.010
if we'd have sent up the
thermal-imaging drone.

04:59.046 --> 05:01.546
You want to see the best tool
in an archaeologist's kit?

05:13.894 --> 05:15.560
[Clattering]

05:37.564 --> 05:38.429
Emma...

05:38.861 --> 05:40.861
I heard you were back in town.

05:40.897 --> 05:42.863
Been wondering when I'd see you.

05:44.234 --> 05:46.901
It's Nikki. My dad used to...

05:46.936 --> 05:48.903
Run the garage! Right, Nikki!

05:48.938 --> 05:51.018
Oh, I'm sorry. It's just been so long.

05:51.043 --> 05:54.411
Well, you've... Hardly changed.

05:54.777 --> 05:57.078
Apparently, you can't say
the same thing about me.

05:57.113 --> 05:58.846
Oh, Nikki, I...

06:03.588 --> 06:04.453
[Man]: Hey, gorgeous.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.454
Hey.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.856
What's special?

06:07.393 --> 06:09.226
My shift ends at nine.

06:09.262 --> 06:10.561
If you're free, maybe we could...

06:10.596 --> 06:11.962
Excuse me a sec.

06:16.828 --> 06:18.445
Emma Fielding.

06:18.470 --> 06:19.769
Will!

06:19.794 --> 06:20.578
[Laughs]

06:20.603 --> 06:21.797
What brings you back here?

06:21.880 --> 06:23.813
Work. I'm doing a dig.

06:23.838 --> 06:25.078
I didn't expect to see you.

06:25.125 --> 06:27.425
Oh, you know, just...
Washed up with the tide.

06:27.461 --> 06:29.364
Last I heard, you were in Florida.

06:29.786 --> 06:31.715
Yeah, actually. I just came
back a few months ago.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.006
Doing salvage, right?

06:33.071 --> 06:34.070
Uh, well...

06:34.105 --> 06:36.406
Underwater exploration
for a petroleum company

06:36.441 --> 06:38.274
until oil prices dropped,

06:38.310 --> 06:39.442
then on to salvage, but...

06:40.075 --> 06:40.985
Anyway, woke up one day

06:41.010 --> 06:42.476
and then said, it's
time to move back home.

06:42.900 --> 06:44.430
I'm glad you did. It's
so good to see you.

06:44.455 --> 06:45.454
You too.

06:48.876 --> 06:49.993
So, do you find time

06:50.018 --> 06:52.423
between teaching classes
and raiding tombs

06:52.448 --> 06:54.884
to get married and have kids?

06:54.909 --> 06:56.309
Not married. No kids.

06:56.334 --> 06:59.101
Well, actually, 11... My dig team.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.019
You?

07:01.570 --> 07:03.103
Long story, too long,

07:03.138 --> 07:04.604
but the skinny version is...

07:04.640 --> 07:05.936
Will Briggs is riding solo,

07:05.961 --> 07:08.896
and, as usual, looking
to reinvent himself.

07:09.258 --> 07:11.531
I've got to say, coming
back and finding you here?

07:11.562 --> 07:12.531
Cherry on the sundae.

07:12.556 --> 07:14.423
Oh, don't talk to me about cherries.

07:14.930 --> 07:16.096
That time we ate a whole bag

07:16.132 --> 07:18.132
your mom got to put in a pie?

07:18.167 --> 07:19.466
She still remembers that.

07:19.502 --> 07:21.502
My stomach remembers.

07:21.537 --> 07:22.536
Oh, man,

07:22.571 --> 07:24.894
I couldn't wait for you to
come here every summer.

07:24.919 --> 07:26.540
I remember, I used to
write it on my calendar.

07:26.575 --> 07:28.308
"Em-day."

07:28.344 --> 07:30.244
Five months, four
months, three months...

07:30.279 --> 07:31.875
Aw, we were so young.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.766
We were teenagers.

07:33.791 --> 07:35.057
We're not not-so-young now.

07:35.082 --> 07:36.648
Ugh, tell that to my students.

07:36.673 --> 07:39.007
Half of them think I'm an antiquity.

07:39.844 --> 07:41.455
So how long are you here for?

07:41.490 --> 07:42.489
Several weeks,

07:42.525 --> 07:44.057
then back to Kenzer college.

07:44.093 --> 07:46.767
I just hope I find proof
of the colony's existence

07:46.861 --> 07:48.128
before then.

07:48.164 --> 07:51.198
Look at you, huh?
Professor Emma Fielding.

07:52.425 --> 07:54.447
- This is you?
- Yeah.

07:54.472 --> 07:55.671
Good. hey, so listen...

07:55.696 --> 07:57.563
You want to do dinner tomorrow night?

07:57.873 --> 08:00.507
We shouldn't go another 20
years without reconnecting.

08:01.178 --> 08:02.976
I'd like that. Sure.

08:03.012 --> 08:05.012
- Good night.
- Good night.

08:12.875 --> 08:15.376
[Man]: Hey! You got no business here.

08:15.591 --> 08:16.928
What?

08:16.953 --> 08:19.153
You got no business here.

08:19.178 --> 08:21.233
I remember you. Augie, right?

08:21.330 --> 08:22.663
Who do you think you are,

08:22.698 --> 08:24.398
coming back here and digging things up,

08:24.433 --> 08:25.399
things that don't belong to you?

08:25.434 --> 08:26.300
Hey!

08:28.900 --> 08:31.034
Are you okay?

08:37.988 --> 08:39.020
Augie!

08:39.563 --> 08:41.263
Augie!

08:58.534 --> 08:59.766
[Pauline]: Emma?

08:59.802 --> 09:03.337
Oh, you're an angel
on caffeinated wings.

09:03.372 --> 09:04.268
I try.

09:04.293 --> 09:06.793
I hear you saw Will Briggs last night.

09:07.076 --> 09:08.508
Village news feed?

09:08.544 --> 09:10.377
Knows all, sees all.

09:10.412 --> 09:12.455
You had quite a crush on
Will once, if I recall.

09:12.480 --> 09:13.745
I was a teenager.

09:13.770 --> 09:15.636
Word is, he's still very attractive.

09:15.661 --> 09:16.361
It's very sweet of you

09:16.393 --> 09:17.962
to be interested in my love life,

09:17.987 --> 09:20.254
but as you know, I'm happily single.

09:27.505 --> 09:28.871
[Phone beeps]

09:33.802 --> 09:36.002
Do you remember Tony Markham?

09:36.037 --> 09:37.403
He worked with your father.

09:37.439 --> 09:40.306
Yeah, he's head of my department now.

09:40.341 --> 09:41.507
He's on his way to observe

09:41.543 --> 09:42.775
and stay overnight.

09:43.334 --> 09:45.178
Tony's okay. He's
always been supportive,

09:45.213 --> 09:47.717
and visiting dig sites
is a part of his job.

09:47.975 --> 09:49.256
Is he staying at the motel?

09:49.287 --> 09:50.627
That's the real problem.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.385
We've taken all the available rooms,

09:52.420 --> 09:53.986
and Tony's kind of particular.

09:54.022 --> 09:55.621
Hmm.

09:56.225 --> 09:58.024
He can stay in my guest room, I suppose,

09:58.059 --> 09:59.264
if that would help you out?

09:59.506 --> 10:00.560
Really?

10:00.595 --> 10:02.095
He would love that. Thank you.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.296
You're welcome,

10:03.331 --> 10:05.798
but you know I'd much rather
have you stay here with me.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.133
I know,

10:07.168 --> 10:08.534
but I'm old-fashioned.

10:08.570 --> 10:09.535
Even though they're post-grads,

10:09.571 --> 10:11.571
I feel like I need to
keep an eye on my kids.

10:12.134 --> 10:14.740
One day, no one's going to be digging.

10:14.776 --> 10:16.776
I mean, the technology's already there.

10:16.811 --> 10:18.277
It'll be done through remote sensing,

10:18.313 --> 10:20.213
totally non-invasive techniques.

10:20.248 --> 10:22.696
It'll be so remote that you
won't even have to show up.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.024
You'll be staring at a laptop
in your parents' basement

10:25.104 --> 10:26.235
when I call you to tell you

10:26.304 --> 10:28.829
I've made the archaeological
find of the century.

10:29.290 --> 10:30.761
With your two little hands, right?

10:30.786 --> 10:31.851
Mm-hmm.

10:31.974 --> 10:34.574
You're more like Fielding every day.

10:34.696 --> 10:36.696
I only wish.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.305
[Man]: Emma!

10:50.574 --> 10:51.673
Tony.

10:52.609 --> 10:54.409
Good to see you.

10:54.444 --> 10:55.119
Thank you.

10:55.144 --> 10:56.911
I couldn't resist coming for a visit,

10:56.998 --> 10:59.865
given what we hope we
may have buried here.

10:59.910 --> 11:01.009
I'm so glad you did.

11:01.034 --> 11:04.569
Everyone, you all know
Professor Markham, of course.

11:04.754 --> 11:06.616
Nice to see you again, sir.

11:06.641 --> 11:08.707
Well, nice to be seen!

11:08.959 --> 11:12.327
Emma's father, Oscar
Fielding, was my Professor,

11:12.362 --> 11:15.663
and he truly was a giant
in American archaeology.

11:15.699 --> 11:17.298
Now, there are those in our field

11:17.334 --> 11:20.168
who didn't believe his
theory of a lost colony,

11:20.203 --> 11:22.626
but, well, those of us who knew him

11:22.713 --> 11:25.046
were moved by his passion...

11:25.086 --> 11:28.195
And something that his
daughter inherited in spades.

11:28.641 --> 11:30.898
Wow, that was a terrible pun.
I apologize.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.640
[Laughing]

11:32.734 --> 11:33.766
Going to give me a tour?

11:33.791 --> 11:34.757
Sure! sure.

11:34.782 --> 11:35.848
Great.

11:36.289 --> 11:38.122
Have you found anything interesting?

11:38.157 --> 11:40.991
We've made a few 18th-century finds.

11:41.027 --> 11:42.170
That's something.

11:42.195 --> 11:43.028
I feel the clock ticking.

11:43.053 --> 11:45.240
I'd like to be moving a bit faster.

11:45.265 --> 11:46.898
Well, I always feel that way.

11:49.272 --> 11:51.109
What is it?

11:51.134 --> 11:52.257
Hey, did...

11:52.282 --> 11:54.132
Did anyone come back last night?

11:54.226 --> 11:55.192
No.

11:55.227 --> 11:56.260
No.

11:58.494 --> 12:00.027
Something's not right.

12:01.773 --> 12:03.973
This ground has been freshly turned.

12:11.062 --> 12:12.861
[Gasps]

12:12.897 --> 12:13.962
Oh, my goodness.

12:15.666 --> 12:17.199
Oh, no.

12:17.234 --> 12:19.241
Somebody call 9-1-1.

12:19.359 --> 12:20.325
You go it.

12:24.213 --> 12:25.812
Augie...

12:26.250 --> 12:28.484
[Sheriff] all right then, I'll find out.

12:29.353 --> 12:30.553
Emma?

12:31.813 --> 12:33.146
Excuse me.

12:34.475 --> 12:36.238
The coroner's office
has a few questions...

12:36.263 --> 12:37.496
[Man]: Excuse me.

12:39.202 --> 12:40.968
Special agent Jim Connor.

12:41.899 --> 12:43.231
I'm part of a rapid deployment team

12:43.256 --> 12:44.404
that deals with theft, forgery,

12:44.445 --> 12:45.583
and trafficking, of antiquities.

12:45.771 --> 12:47.204
Are you saying that Augie
had something to do

12:47.251 --> 12:48.750
with the trafficking of antiquities?

12:48.818 --> 12:50.851
Well, that's... I'm
here to find that out.

12:51.105 --> 12:52.051
Sheriff, I'm not going
to get in your way.

12:52.076 --> 12:54.109
We're accustomed to dealing
with these types of crimes.

12:54.145 --> 12:55.244
On archaeological digs?

12:55.972 --> 12:57.646
At important ones.

12:58.441 --> 12:59.982
The local office tipped
me off about the body,

13:00.011 --> 13:00.983
that's why I'm here.

13:01.018 --> 13:02.308
[Sheriff]: I see.

13:02.391 --> 13:04.104
Well, I'll be happy to cooperate.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.967
Hopefully, that'll be a two-way street.

13:14.382 --> 13:15.874
This is Emma's project.

13:15.932 --> 13:17.030
She's the archaeologist.

13:17.055 --> 13:18.255
I know who you are.

13:18.447 --> 13:20.180
Nice to meet you, Professor Fielding.

13:20.504 --> 13:22.037
You too.

13:22.190 --> 13:24.468
She's also the one that found Augie...

13:24.740 --> 13:26.122
The deceased.

13:26.247 --> 13:27.279
Must have been a shock.

13:27.888 --> 13:29.919
Yeah, obviously, most of
my finds are mummified,

13:29.944 --> 13:31.747
but I studied forensics.

13:31.952 --> 13:33.352
Seen my share of dead bodies.

13:33.997 --> 13:35.154
So, forensics, huh?

13:35.189 --> 13:36.855
Ancient and modern.

13:38.626 --> 13:40.058
You considering this a homicide?

13:40.094 --> 13:41.114
Most likely.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.387
Any idea of the cause of death?

13:42.422 --> 13:45.544
Large bruise on the forehead,
gash in the back of the head.

13:45.654 --> 13:48.188
His clothes were soaked through,

13:48.231 --> 13:49.568
and I saw the back of his head

13:49.593 --> 13:51.331
when the coroner's team
was taking his body

13:51.356 --> 13:52.255
out of the trench.

13:52.328 --> 13:55.295
Somebody gave him an
incredibly hard whack.

13:56.912 --> 13:57.778
So the bruise on the forehead,

13:57.813 --> 13:59.530
you think it happened at the same time?

13:59.594 --> 14:00.760
No.

14:01.952 --> 14:03.251
No? why?

14:03.552 --> 14:05.552
I did that to him.

14:07.358 --> 14:08.537
[Emma]: I slapped his arm away,

14:08.562 --> 14:10.462
and he lost his balance.

14:10.621 --> 14:14.083
He fell, and that's when
he dinged his forehead.

14:14.419 --> 14:16.252
So he threatened you?

14:16.683 --> 14:18.054
Yeah.

14:18.551 --> 14:20.470
What did he say?

14:20.486 --> 14:24.020
Um, he said that I had no business here,

14:24.056 --> 14:26.957
that I was taking things
that don't belong to me.

14:26.992 --> 14:28.136
Okay, then...

14:28.248 --> 14:30.292
I may have to ask you a
few more questions, Emma,

14:30.343 --> 14:31.878
but you're not going anywhere, are you?

14:32.020 --> 14:33.219
No.

14:33.371 --> 14:34.537
Good.

14:41.022 --> 14:42.021
Sheriff?

14:42.571 --> 14:43.871
Hey.

14:43.906 --> 14:45.406
I'm worried about the kids.

14:46.140 --> 14:47.491
I'll post a deputy up here

14:47.516 --> 14:49.500
during the day while
you're digging, all right?

14:49.566 --> 14:50.598
Thank you.

14:53.184 --> 14:54.707
- Agent Connor?
- Yeah?

14:54.732 --> 14:55.926
I'm not a suspect, am I,

14:55.951 --> 14:58.293
'cause of the bump on Augie's head?

14:58.356 --> 14:59.355
Well, let's see.

14:59.390 --> 15:01.857
Last to see the deceased.
First to find the body.

15:01.892 --> 15:04.059
Do you think that qualifies
you as a suspect?

15:04.095 --> 15:05.494
Not to an astute detective.

15:06.434 --> 15:07.325
No?

15:07.376 --> 15:10.010
Why would I bury his body on my site?

15:10.998 --> 15:12.764
That's a good question.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.833
I hadn't thought about that.

15:18.505 --> 15:19.871
You had me going there.

15:19.907 --> 15:21.450
You have a good poker face.

15:21.865 --> 15:23.872
I practice in the mirror.

15:31.588 --> 15:32.821
[Tony]: So the map you found,

15:32.856 --> 15:34.721
it's, uh, it's helping?

15:34.991 --> 15:36.510
We wouldn't be here without it.

15:36.541 --> 15:37.892
My dad knew there was a
colony, but he didn't know

15:37.928 --> 15:39.994
where on the coast they'd settled.

15:40.030 --> 15:41.663
That's why he never chose a site,

15:41.698 --> 15:43.365
even after all those years of research.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.599
Yeah.

15:44.634 --> 15:46.136
I just got lucky to find a map

15:46.215 --> 15:48.495
that seems to pinpoint the
location of the colony.

15:48.557 --> 15:50.457
Yeah.

15:51.402 --> 15:54.202
You know, your father was treated poorly

15:54.227 --> 15:55.846
at the end of his life.

15:55.930 --> 15:58.064
When his colleagues dismissed his theory

15:58.089 --> 15:59.979
on the lost colony,

16:00.081 --> 16:02.911
well, his reputation
took a terrible hit.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.596
I always thought

16:05.621 --> 16:07.388
that he deserved better than that,

16:08.013 --> 16:08.997
but I do hope

16:09.022 --> 16:11.823
that that's not the main
reason why you're here,

16:12.425 --> 16:13.658
to prove him right.

16:14.313 --> 16:16.828
I'm going to prove it for myself, too...

16:17.196 --> 16:20.086
Not to mention the prestige
it'll bring the college,

16:20.141 --> 16:21.517
and a find like this is important

16:21.553 --> 16:23.252
to the history of our country.

16:23.288 --> 16:24.120
Of course.

16:24.155 --> 16:26.221
I know they're going to solve this soon,

16:26.246 --> 16:28.346
and we will find evidence of the colony.

16:29.245 --> 16:31.345
I'm sure you're right.

16:33.798 --> 16:36.122
I'm thinking that I'll stick
around just to be sure

16:36.147 --> 16:38.881
that continuing the dig
is the right decision.

17:00.391 --> 17:01.691
[Sheriff]: So, why would Augie be buried

17:01.726 --> 17:03.192
on this site, do you think?

17:03.618 --> 17:05.684
Well, you certainly wouldn't
want to bury a body

17:05.720 --> 17:06.886
on an archaeological dig site

17:06.921 --> 17:09.055
unless you wanted it discovered.

17:09.137 --> 17:11.271
There's a message there,

17:11.392 --> 17:13.659
and I'm beginning to think
it's aimed at Emma Fielding.

17:13.694 --> 17:14.827
[Knocking]

17:17.253 --> 17:18.686
Thanks.

17:18.722 --> 17:19.922
I need to report a robbery.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.464
- Where?
- At the dig site.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.040
Somebody stole my map.

17:24.076 --> 17:24.936
Was it valuable?

17:24.983 --> 17:27.143
The original is, but that's
back at the state archives.

17:27.179 --> 17:28.979
This is just a copy.

17:29.727 --> 17:32.250
- Why would someone want it?
- I don't know.

17:32.359 --> 17:33.906
Turns out you were right, Emma.

17:33.969 --> 17:34.901
Coroner's report shows

17:34.936 --> 17:37.303
Augie Clements died of
blunt-force trauma.

17:54.113 --> 17:55.212
Hey.

17:55.550 --> 17:57.635
You guys with Professor Fielding's team?

17:57.819 --> 17:58.751
Uh-huh.

17:58.776 --> 17:59.917
That's cool.

17:59.953 --> 18:01.485
Hey, was she still out on the dig site

18:01.521 --> 18:02.453
when you guys left?

18:02.488 --> 18:04.789
Uh, I think so, yeah.

18:05.261 --> 18:06.755
Once she starts working,

18:06.811 --> 18:08.294
she kind of loses track of time.

18:08.334 --> 18:10.033
A bit obsessive, actually.

18:10.058 --> 18:11.693
She is not obsessive.

18:12.107 --> 18:15.450
She just loves her work more
than anything else, that's all.

18:15.513 --> 18:17.294
Yeah, that's the impression I'm getting.

18:17.452 --> 18:18.818
Thanks.

18:21.695 --> 18:24.763
Okay, totally reassessing
Professor Fielding.

18:24.798 --> 18:27.991
When she's not in the trenches,
she's hanging out with that guy?

18:28.163 --> 18:30.641
You actually think that old guy is cool?

18:30.722 --> 18:32.789
Come on. You've got to be kidding me.

18:34.274 --> 18:35.506
[Laughing]

18:45.917 --> 18:47.284
Sorry I'm late.

18:47.309 --> 18:50.521
Actually thought I'd lost out to a
bit of old pottery or something.

18:53.191 --> 18:54.348
You okay?

18:54.387 --> 18:55.487
[Man]: Everyone?

18:55.522 --> 18:56.454
Listen up.

18:56.490 --> 18:57.956
Quiet down.

18:59.159 --> 19:01.626
We lost one of our own last night.

19:01.661 --> 19:03.039
You all knew him.

19:03.164 --> 19:05.407
He didn't deserve to pass like that,

19:05.432 --> 19:07.065
and, well...

19:09.970 --> 19:11.035
Here's to Augie.

19:11.969 --> 19:13.869
To Augie!

19:14.881 --> 19:16.374
Do you mind if we get out of here?

19:16.409 --> 19:17.809
I've kind of lost my appetite.

19:17.844 --> 19:19.043
Yeah.

19:28.611 --> 19:31.178
So what's going on?
What's bothering you?

19:31.424 --> 19:33.458
I'm the one who found Augie.

19:33.493 --> 19:34.533
What?

19:34.620 --> 19:35.853
They think he was murdered.

19:37.735 --> 19:39.935
Wow, that must've been...

19:40.033 --> 19:41.132
Horrible for you.

19:41.168 --> 19:42.264
Yeah.

19:42.903 --> 19:44.269
Wow.

19:44.304 --> 19:46.390
I was on my boat all day. I
didn't even know Augie died

19:46.415 --> 19:48.114
until they toasted him a minute ago.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.441
He was buried at my dig site,

19:50.477 --> 19:52.677
and somebody stole my map.

19:52.712 --> 19:53.912
Map?

19:53.947 --> 19:56.447
Yeah, I found it in the Maine archives.

19:56.483 --> 19:57.682
It pinpoints the exact location

19:57.717 --> 19:58.683
of the settlement.

19:58.718 --> 20:00.718
At least... I hope it does.

20:00.754 --> 20:04.430
Only my students and a few other people
have even seen it.

20:04.501 --> 20:05.967
You think the two are related?

20:06.002 --> 20:06.968
I don't know.

20:07.003 --> 20:09.637
Somebody's very interested
in what I'm doing.

20:09.673 --> 20:13.241
Maybe they think there's something
out there worth killing for.

20:13.276 --> 20:14.909
Like what?

20:14.944 --> 20:16.878
Gold coins.

20:17.337 --> 20:19.360
You mean, like we used to look for
when we were kids?

20:19.437 --> 20:21.220
Yeah, chest full of
gold coins, given to

20:21.245 --> 20:22.916
the Colonists by the Queen of England.

20:22.952 --> 20:24.952
Everybody knows that's a myth.

20:25.338 --> 20:27.805
Maybe not everybody.

20:38.534 --> 20:40.427
[Gasps]

20:40.486 --> 20:42.119
Oh, no.

20:46.971 --> 20:48.136
Hey.

20:48.172 --> 20:49.394
Where's sheriff Stannard?

20:49.419 --> 20:50.618
He's at the coroner's office.

20:50.706 --> 20:51.851
I just heard the call come in.

20:51.923 --> 20:53.390
Came down to see if you were all right.

20:53.541 --> 20:55.541
I'm fine, but...

20:57.164 --> 20:58.163
Anything missing?

20:58.198 --> 21:01.229
I don't think so, but
when you add it all up...

21:01.254 --> 21:03.594
You, or at least your site, is
being targeted by somebody.

21:05.192 --> 21:06.891
You seem to be finishing my thoughts...

21:07.285 --> 21:08.584
Great minds.

21:08.619 --> 21:09.618
You know...

21:10.012 --> 21:13.713
If you really believe
that, I have a proposal.

21:14.149 --> 21:15.982
Okay, sounds interesting.

21:16.017 --> 21:17.483
It's about your investigation...

21:17.519 --> 21:18.584
An offer of help.

21:18.914 --> 21:19.986
You think I need help?

21:20.021 --> 21:21.054
Well, I mean...

21:21.089 --> 21:23.823
It's been almost a whole
day since I found Augie,

21:23.858 --> 21:26.159
and doesn't the trail
go cold after 48 hours?

21:26.626 --> 21:29.095
Oh, I see, after 48 hours,
I have to drop the case,

21:29.154 --> 21:32.456
but you can pick it up
after two centuries?

21:32.577 --> 21:34.923
It's not a competition, agent Connor.

21:34.977 --> 21:36.943
A collaboration will help us both.

21:37.009 --> 21:38.508
You get to save your case,

21:38.544 --> 21:39.876
and I keep my college's Grant committee

21:39.912 --> 21:41.011
from shutting down my dig.

21:41.832 --> 21:45.315
I'm willing to take testimony
from reliable witnesses,

21:45.350 --> 21:46.283
Professor Fielding,

21:46.318 --> 21:48.293
but I also have people
I have to answer to,

21:48.324 --> 21:50.357
and the bureau doesn't
really allow us to...

21:50.502 --> 21:54.204
Collaborate with amateur detectives.

21:55.006 --> 21:57.273
I'm hardly an amateur.

21:57.372 --> 21:59.255
I'm a detective just like you.

21:59.295 --> 22:00.747
I investigate,

22:00.801 --> 22:03.021
and I make deductions
that lead to solutions.

22:03.164 --> 22:05.068
Murder and the motivation behind it

22:05.093 --> 22:07.721
are the same today as when
humans lived in caves.

22:08.137 --> 22:09.904
Look, it's a one-time offer.

22:10.537 --> 22:12.337
I'll think it over.

22:12.372 --> 22:15.173
In the meantime, don't
touch anything in here.

22:15.208 --> 22:17.609
I'm going to have a team come in
here and dust for fingerprints.

22:27.287 --> 22:28.720
Hey, everybody.

22:30.290 --> 22:32.123
Look, I know what
happened at the dig site

22:32.159 --> 22:33.755
was upsetting for all of us.

22:34.193 --> 22:35.994
The sheriff is investigating,

22:36.029 --> 22:39.397
and he's posting a
deputy at the dig site

22:39.433 --> 22:40.398
to keep an eye on things,

22:40.434 --> 22:43.543
but if anyone feels
uncomfortable going back,

22:43.689 --> 22:46.189
I completely understand.

22:46.973 --> 22:48.139
We're with you, Professor.

22:50.422 --> 22:52.823
Okay. let's go.

22:56.516 --> 22:59.444
Who could he be trying
to impress, I wonder?

23:00.454 --> 23:03.288
It's going to take more than hair gel.

23:09.745 --> 23:11.778
You thought about what I said?

23:16.266 --> 23:18.033
What do you know about Emma's map?

23:18.417 --> 23:20.405
Map? What map?

23:20.440 --> 23:22.307
You know exactly what I'm talking about.

23:22.342 --> 23:25.818
And I think she's very
attracted to you, Mr. Briggs.

23:25.901 --> 23:27.401
I call that opportunity...

23:28.248 --> 23:31.583
If you're bold enough to take advantage.

23:36.938 --> 23:38.256
Emma...

23:38.509 --> 23:40.476
Thought you might've
considered taking the day off.

23:40.511 --> 23:42.645
We have artifacts to find.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.146
The students were all up for it.

23:44.182 --> 23:47.023
Well, it's one thing working
yourself to exhaustion,

23:47.048 --> 23:49.821
but it's another to have the
expectation that your students will.

23:50.273 --> 23:51.484
If you're not going to stop, at least

23:51.509 --> 23:52.884
give them the rest of the day off.

23:53.174 --> 23:54.540
Well, I mean...

23:55.014 --> 23:56.580
We still have a few hours to go.

23:56.605 --> 23:59.339
Given what happened
yesterday, I think it's best.

24:02.617 --> 24:04.217
All right, gang.

24:04.634 --> 24:06.501
Let's call it a day!

24:06.860 --> 24:08.794
I'll meet you back at the
motel in a few hours.

24:09.747 --> 24:11.080
What's that about?

24:18.681 --> 24:21.248
Told you you'd regret not
taking me up on my offer.

24:23.323 --> 24:25.757
That's not exactly why I'm here.

24:26.305 --> 24:27.355
- No?
- No.

24:27.379 --> 24:29.613
I was hoping that you could
share some of your techniques.

24:29.821 --> 24:30.887
Really?

24:30.912 --> 24:32.345
Detective to detective?

24:32.479 --> 24:34.078
Detective to detective.

24:34.689 --> 24:35.658
All right.

24:35.713 --> 24:37.780
First lesson is that you're
never going to find anything

24:37.815 --> 24:40.049
unless you're willing
to get down and dirty.

24:40.084 --> 24:41.117
Get down here.

24:42.987 --> 24:44.387
All right.

24:44.422 --> 24:46.822
We take up the dirt an inch at
a time across the whole pit.

24:46.858 --> 24:49.425
If you find something,
even if you want to,

24:49.460 --> 24:51.627
don't take it out until
it's fully exposed.

24:51.662 --> 24:53.929
The depth of the artifact
is what determines its age.

24:53.965 --> 24:55.591
Okay, inch at a time.

24:55.618 --> 24:56.984
Yeah, carefully.

24:57.623 --> 25:00.069
Then we take the dirt and
put it in this bucket.

25:00.104 --> 25:02.665
When we're done, we sift
it through these screens

25:02.690 --> 25:04.283
in case we missed any smaller artifacts,

25:04.308 --> 25:07.276
like bone fragments or buttons.

25:07.311 --> 25:08.477
Mm.

25:09.949 --> 25:11.648
So...

25:12.012 --> 25:14.179
How'd you end up in the
antiquities division?

25:14.285 --> 25:17.044
I got shot. I was chasing a bad guy.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.881
Wow.

25:19.027 --> 25:20.248
Must've been hard on your family.

25:20.273 --> 25:21.572
It was hard on my son...

25:23.352 --> 25:24.985
But you know, we'd... grown apart

25:25.010 --> 25:26.843
during the divorce I had with his mom,

25:27.777 --> 25:29.924
so the silver lining
to taking a bullet was

25:30.008 --> 25:32.108
that it brought us back together.

25:32.758 --> 25:35.541
You know, he's at college
now, but I see him a lot.

25:36.278 --> 25:38.518
So this assignment

25:38.565 --> 25:40.588
is sort of like being
put out to pasture?

25:40.613 --> 25:41.746
[Laughs]

25:41.970 --> 25:44.869
That's not the metaphor I'd use, no.

25:44.929 --> 25:46.393
Sorry.

25:46.648 --> 25:49.557
I've got to admit, though, I
wasn't thrilled at first,

25:49.643 --> 25:51.777
but it sure beats a desk job.

25:51.812 --> 25:52.744
And now?

25:52.780 --> 25:54.412
Now I'm digging it.

25:54.818 --> 25:56.682
You did not just say that!

25:56.717 --> 25:59.131
Ugh, it's going to be a long afternoon.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.267
So, what exactly are
we looking for here?

26:01.388 --> 26:03.021
Proof that there were settlers here

26:03.057 --> 26:05.357
before the Colonists
landed at Jamestown.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.975
So, how do you know Will Briggs?

26:09.076 --> 26:10.342
We're old friends.

26:10.564 --> 26:13.298
Spent summers here as a
teenager, up until college.

26:14.601 --> 26:15.567
Why?

26:15.850 --> 26:18.203
Just getting a feel for
the local population.

26:19.022 --> 26:20.138
Stop!

26:20.163 --> 26:21.406
What?

26:21.755 --> 26:23.688
I think you've found something.

26:29.683 --> 26:31.016
Earthenware.

26:35.292 --> 26:36.597
Made on site.

26:37.891 --> 26:38.824
Looks like the right era.

26:38.859 --> 26:40.992
How can you tell that? I mean,
do you got X-ray vision?

26:41.028 --> 26:42.093
[Laughs]

26:42.118 --> 26:44.960
No, I've studied these... A lot of 'em,

26:45.039 --> 26:47.773
so even if it's broken or incomplete,

26:47.836 --> 26:50.503
I can tell from the rim
what it should be.

26:52.685 --> 26:54.151
Well, I guess I'm a natural.

26:54.187 --> 26:56.287
Well, you have a very good teacher.

26:56.719 --> 26:58.185
[Laughs]

26:59.067 --> 27:00.794
A buried pitcher?

27:00.872 --> 27:02.816
You think it's part of the lost colony?

27:02.851 --> 27:04.584
It might be.

27:04.619 --> 27:07.430
We still have to uncover it,
document it and date it.

27:07.455 --> 27:09.254
That'll take a few days.

27:09.622 --> 27:11.355
You and your father...

27:11.960 --> 27:13.560
Only patient when you're digging.

27:14.401 --> 27:16.996
You are so much like him.

27:17.032 --> 27:18.098
It makes me worry.

27:18.395 --> 27:19.399
Worry?

27:19.434 --> 27:22.598
Sometimes, I think that
you don't take the time

27:22.623 --> 27:26.599
to create a life for yourself
here in the present.

27:26.677 --> 27:28.244
I have a life.

27:28.474 --> 27:31.341
My work, my research, my students...

27:31.399 --> 27:32.403
I have you.

27:32.876 --> 27:35.410
You deserve to find someone special.

27:36.841 --> 27:37.740
Okay, look...

27:37.776 --> 27:40.310
It's not like I haven't tried.

27:40.345 --> 27:42.212
With the way I work and travel,

27:42.247 --> 27:44.714
it's really hard to build
a lasting connection.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.287
I know.

27:46.401 --> 27:48.134
I remember how your father was.

27:48.693 --> 27:50.544
How did you two make it work?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.247
Oscar and I were equal partners.

27:52.435 --> 27:53.468
We shared it all.

27:53.503 --> 27:55.103
You could have something
that special, too...

27:55.872 --> 27:58.150
Someone who knows your heart.

27:58.862 --> 28:01.095
That does sound nice...

28:03.180 --> 28:05.515
But, in the meantime,

28:05.664 --> 28:06.797
I'm going to go check on the dig site

28:06.832 --> 28:08.899
before I head back to the motel.

28:08.934 --> 28:10.601
And I'm going to head inside.

28:10.636 --> 28:11.761
[Laughing]

28:11.785 --> 28:12.776
Good night, Emma.

28:12.801 --> 28:14.409
Good night.

28:14.496 --> 28:16.355
- Okay. you be careful up there.
- I will.

28:16.425 --> 28:18.725
Okay. good night.

28:18.761 --> 28:20.194
[Thunder rolls]

28:41.510 --> 28:42.843
Hey!

28:43.822 --> 28:45.296
This is private property.
What are you doing?

28:45.321 --> 28:46.887
Name's Graham Tichnor.

28:47.219 --> 28:48.218
Pauline knows me.

28:49.421 --> 28:51.221
You're trespassing, Mr. Tichnor.

28:52.728 --> 28:55.095
She never had a problem with
me being around here before.

28:55.646 --> 28:57.646
She does now.

28:58.825 --> 29:02.603
Nothing here is yours
until you find it...

29:02.943 --> 29:04.776
If you find it.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.223
[Pauline]: Graham Tichnor.

29:12.259 --> 29:13.925
He's a picker.

29:13.961 --> 29:15.360
He scours the towns and villages

29:15.395 --> 29:18.296
for anything that the dealers
didn't get to first.

29:18.332 --> 29:21.099
He's been known to forge his
own "antiques" occasionally

29:21.134 --> 29:22.901
for unsuspecting tourists.

29:22.936 --> 29:24.899
So why would he be
snooping around the dig?

29:24.924 --> 29:25.823
He'll do whatever it takes

29:25.848 --> 29:27.013
to get his hands on anything he can sell

29:27.038 --> 29:28.671
to the highest bidder.

29:28.842 --> 29:31.509
He offered me $50 for my goddess statue!

29:31.818 --> 29:33.251
[Tony]: Goddess statue?

29:35.449 --> 29:37.869
My most precious gift from Oscar.

29:37.931 --> 29:40.760
I keep it there so I can
see it every morning.

29:40.908 --> 29:43.375
Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity.

29:43.410 --> 29:44.710
Absolutely right, Tony.

29:44.745 --> 29:45.711
She's lovely.

29:45.746 --> 29:46.712
Thank you.

29:46.747 --> 29:47.713
[Emma]: Tony,

29:47.748 --> 29:50.092
I think I may have found something
at the dig site today...

29:50.117 --> 29:51.717
A piece of pottery.

29:51.787 --> 29:52.787
If it's what I think it is,

29:52.812 --> 29:54.877
it may bring us significantly
closer to our goal.

29:55.365 --> 29:56.931
Well, that's great!

29:56.967 --> 29:58.266
Yeah.

30:03.497 --> 30:04.934
Hey, thank you for meeting me.

30:04.959 --> 30:06.058
I got you a coffee.

30:06.300 --> 30:07.766
Oh, thank you!

30:10.138 --> 30:11.838
So, I've been thinking.

30:12.904 --> 30:14.007
Oh.

30:14.279 --> 30:15.442
Okay, go on.

30:15.477 --> 30:18.077
Okay, a body was buried at my site,

30:18.536 --> 30:20.849
then my map was stolen, and
my hotel room was trashed.

30:20.936 --> 30:22.736
So connect the dots,
they all connect to you.

30:23.255 --> 30:26.286
Or maybe it's not me.
What if it's my dig site?

30:26.321 --> 30:28.205
I keep thinking about
something Will Briggs said

30:28.230 --> 30:29.396
about buried treasure.

30:29.424 --> 30:30.390
Buried treasure?

30:30.425 --> 30:32.133
The Queen's gold coins.

30:32.165 --> 30:34.031
Supposedly, she sent
them with the Colonists

30:34.066 --> 30:35.508
to help fund the settlement.

30:35.548 --> 30:36.678
My father debunked that story,

30:36.703 --> 30:38.555
but will said a lot of
people still believe it.

30:38.906 --> 30:40.484
So they think that you're
after the gold coins,

30:40.519 --> 30:41.618
not the settlement.

30:41.654 --> 30:44.555
Augie said I was taking things
that don't belong to me.

30:45.094 --> 30:47.735
So, the competition knocked off Augie,

30:47.760 --> 30:49.693
and they stole your map
and searched your room...

30:49.729 --> 30:50.694
To see if I'd found anything.

30:50.730 --> 30:51.662
It's plausible.

30:52.150 --> 30:53.704
I mean, it doesn't give
me a suspect, but...

30:53.783 --> 30:55.232
Graham Tichnor.

30:55.267 --> 30:56.283
He's a picker.

30:56.308 --> 30:59.910
He buys, steals and forges
antiques and artifacts.

31:00.005 --> 31:02.139
I found him poking around
my site last night.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.200
You "found" him?

31:03.225 --> 31:05.392
Well, he was trespassing. I wasn't.

31:06.221 --> 31:07.895
I think we need to go talk to him.

31:08.741 --> 31:09.747
We?

31:09.782 --> 31:12.216
Or me, if you don't want to come along.

31:12.888 --> 31:15.134
Listen, I appreciate that you want
to be involved in this, I do...

31:15.159 --> 31:17.760
A man may have been killed
because of what I'm doing.

31:18.059 --> 31:19.892
Obviously, I don't want
my project shut down,

31:19.928 --> 31:21.494
but I also don't want anybody else

31:21.529 --> 31:23.062
to get brought into this.

31:24.232 --> 31:26.032
Okay. all right.

31:26.067 --> 31:29.235
I get it, but I've got it covered.

31:32.929 --> 31:34.529
Oh, no... Oh, no!

31:36.741 --> 31:38.574
Somebody's been digging.

31:38.622 --> 31:39.655
Okay...

31:39.690 --> 31:41.130
Uh...

31:41.201 --> 31:43.212
I think the best thing we can do here...

31:43.489 --> 31:46.115
Photograph and log any
unauthorized digging,

31:46.603 --> 31:49.604
but for now,
just leave everything as it is.

31:50.921 --> 31:52.855
Emma, you know, between the murder,

31:52.890 --> 31:54.356
and your map...

31:54.392 --> 31:55.824
We've got to think of the students.

31:55.858 --> 31:57.189
The students come first. I know...

31:57.322 --> 32:00.229
And I agree with you, but the
sheriff's deputy is here all day.

32:00.264 --> 32:01.730
There's no risk to the students.

32:01.766 --> 32:02.931
Well...

32:03.854 --> 32:05.554
We're going to have to
tell him about this.

32:05.589 --> 32:06.888
I will.

32:17.765 --> 32:20.124
Everybody, come here.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.665
I want to show you something remarkable.

32:28.931 --> 32:29.977
Ohw.

32:33.174 --> 32:34.258
Wow.

32:39.817 --> 32:40.813
Professor?

32:40.838 --> 32:42.420
Hey, agent Connor.

32:42.467 --> 32:44.836
Um, I think Tichnor came back last night

32:44.914 --> 32:47.242
and was digging around my site
looking for something.

32:47.281 --> 32:48.296
I thought you were
going to question him.

32:48.321 --> 32:50.555
Sheriff Stannard's bringing him in
this afternoon.

32:50.590 --> 32:52.531
- Don't worry.
- I am worried.

32:52.580 --> 32:54.297
My department head is
close to shutting me down

32:54.322 --> 32:55.765
because of what's going on.

32:55.852 --> 32:57.218
Do you have any new leads?

32:58.500 --> 33:00.933
Uh, no match for the
prints found in your room.

33:01.361 --> 33:02.960
Whoever trashed it wasn't in the system,

33:02.985 --> 33:03.950
and no prints at the shed.

33:03.986 --> 33:05.285
Probably wore gloves.

33:05.320 --> 33:07.154
Okay, well, Augie's clothes were soaked.

33:07.189 --> 33:08.188
Was it sea water?

33:08.223 --> 33:09.322
It was.

33:09.507 --> 33:10.524
Is that all?

33:10.559 --> 33:11.658
Was there anything in the pockets?

33:11.693 --> 33:13.093
Just, you know, bits and pieces.

33:13.128 --> 33:14.194
Perfect.

33:14.494 --> 33:16.961
Bits and pieces are my speciality.

33:20.451 --> 33:21.884
All right.

33:25.741 --> 33:27.741
"Assorted contents, unknown."

33:27.776 --> 33:29.476
Oh, my favorite kind.

33:29.511 --> 33:32.546
Okay, we've got comb...

33:32.581 --> 33:35.218
Dime... definitely 21st century...

33:35.617 --> 33:38.250
Credit card, expired...

33:38.275 --> 33:39.508
[Gasps]

33:40.756 --> 33:42.640
Can we open this evidence bag?

34:00.876 --> 34:02.876
Late 1600s...

34:03.352 --> 34:05.586
Wine flask.

34:05.621 --> 34:07.621
You can tell that by looking at that?

34:07.657 --> 34:09.156
You mean you can't?

34:09.672 --> 34:10.549
Funny.

34:10.862 --> 34:11.916
The question is...

34:11.940 --> 34:13.815
What would they be doing
in Augie's pocket?

34:13.862 --> 34:14.704
Yes, and they wouldn't,

34:14.739 --> 34:15.705
unless he was hanging out with someone

34:15.741 --> 34:18.440
who was digging test
holes on Pauline's land.

34:18.476 --> 34:19.708
Like your friend, Mr. Tichnor.

34:19.745 --> 34:20.710
Exactly.

34:23.870 --> 34:25.002
Connor.

34:26.585 --> 34:28.217
Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.

34:29.588 --> 34:32.088
They found Augie's jacket.

34:39.130 --> 34:40.362
You two a team now?

34:40.399 --> 34:43.433
- No, nothing like that.
- We're not a team.

34:43.467 --> 34:45.534
Oh, that's a jacket Augie had on

34:45.570 --> 34:47.871
the night I saw him,

34:47.906 --> 34:50.203
but not when I found him the next day.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.331
I, uh, I know you're
going to tell me anyway,

34:53.356 --> 34:55.255
so... what do you think happened?

34:55.292 --> 34:56.625
Maybe the jacket came off

34:56.667 --> 34:59.453
when the killer dragged
the body off the boat,

34:59.549 --> 35:01.383
through the surf, and
up to the dig site?

35:01.618 --> 35:03.544
And then what would
you deduct from that?

35:03.630 --> 35:05.063
Killer had access to a boat.

35:05.098 --> 35:06.565
Killer had access to a boat.

35:07.247 --> 35:08.997
So it could be anybody in Maine.

35:09.191 --> 35:11.892
Okay, let me think for a minute.

35:13.537 --> 35:17.072
If I was going to drag a 190-pound body

35:17.107 --> 35:19.274
along the sand...

35:19.887 --> 35:22.087
I'd have to leave something.

35:28.621 --> 35:30.821
Connor!

35:31.021 --> 35:34.189
Come here. I want to show you something.

35:34.224 --> 35:35.624
- Yeah?
- Look there.

35:35.690 --> 35:37.793
- Yeah.
- See it?

35:37.828 --> 35:40.695
It's a bead, there.

35:40.731 --> 35:42.297
It's a bead.

35:43.300 --> 35:44.816
Maybe a tourist dropped it.

35:44.841 --> 35:46.553
No, tourists don't come to this beach.

35:46.578 --> 35:49.112
You can't swim. The
current's too strong.

35:49.169 --> 35:51.590
Look how it's worn down on the outside?

35:51.615 --> 35:53.581
This is from a string
of Greek worry beads.

35:54.692 --> 35:56.692
Yeah, you move them around in your hand,

35:56.731 --> 35:58.898
and they make a rhythm. the
beads swing against each other

35:58.933 --> 36:01.033
and they make a clicking sound.

36:03.221 --> 36:06.489
Name's Graham Tichnor. Pauline knows me.

36:06.774 --> 36:08.641
[Light clicking sound]

36:12.899 --> 36:17.195
Graham Tichnor had a string
of these beads. I saw them,

36:17.219 --> 36:21.074
so this bead could be what links Tichnor
to Augie's murder.

36:22.203 --> 36:23.354
Uh...

36:23.852 --> 36:24.886
Circumstantially, maybe.

36:24.922 --> 36:27.356
I mean, if that was
Graham Tichnor's bead,

36:27.395 --> 36:29.492
how do you know he just didn't
drop it walking down the beach?

36:29.517 --> 36:30.934
Well, maybe so, but...

36:31.004 --> 36:31.970
You know, you're right.

36:32.279 --> 36:34.668
Our careers are more
similar than I thought,

36:34.693 --> 36:36.692
but there's one important difference.

36:36.770 --> 36:38.470
Your evidence has to
stand up to peer review.

36:38.506 --> 36:40.285
Mine has to stand up in a court of law,

36:40.346 --> 36:41.887
against a defense attorney...

36:42.733 --> 36:45.367
So a bead is not going to cut it.

36:46.177 --> 36:49.181
Listen, don't be tempted to go
chasing after these suspects.

36:49.216 --> 36:51.183
These people are not playing around.

37:00.038 --> 37:01.471
Hey!

37:02.312 --> 37:03.277
What's going on?

37:03.306 --> 37:04.271
Have a look.

37:04.307 --> 37:05.373
[Gasps]

37:05.408 --> 37:07.408
No!

37:07.443 --> 37:09.110
Oh, no, they took the pitcher.

37:09.145 --> 37:10.578
But we photographed it!

37:10.613 --> 37:11.946
And documented it.

37:11.981 --> 37:12.947
Which means very little

37:12.982 --> 37:14.682
without the actual artifact.

37:14.717 --> 37:16.450
The extraction's been compromised.

37:16.486 --> 37:19.754
There's no way for us to know the
soil level that it was found at,

37:19.789 --> 37:22.089
or be able to cross-reference
it with our other finds.

37:22.837 --> 37:24.091
So we have no way to date it.

37:24.127 --> 37:24.992
Yeah, and even if it turned up

37:25.027 --> 37:28.295
with a... "Private
collector" somewhere...

37:28.331 --> 37:31.132
It has no archaeological value at all,

37:31.167 --> 37:33.033
as if we'd never found it.

37:36.339 --> 37:38.439
So unfortunately,

37:38.474 --> 37:41.909
this brings us back to square one...

37:41.944 --> 37:42.910
Which only means

37:42.945 --> 37:45.579
we have to work harder
than we did before, right?

37:45.615 --> 37:46.981
All right, let's do it.

37:47.016 --> 37:48.416
Guys, you know...

37:48.451 --> 37:50.651
Everybody's already been
working a lot of overtime,

37:50.686 --> 37:52.987
so I think perhaps we
should take this chance

37:53.022 --> 37:55.456
to be able to reconsider our options.

37:55.919 --> 37:58.935
All right, let's pull the plug
for today. Good work, everybody.

37:58.974 --> 38:01.374
Okay, sure.

38:02.102 --> 38:03.936
It's unfortunate.

38:13.724 --> 38:15.491
Emma, I know that you're upset.

38:16.994 --> 38:19.995
Tony, I know this is your department,

38:20.031 --> 38:23.499
but this is my map,
my Grant, and my dig,

38:23.534 --> 38:25.034
and I'll tell my students
when they're done.

38:25.069 --> 38:26.654
I had to step in, all right?

38:26.702 --> 38:29.427
And I will again if you push
your students, or yourself,

38:29.452 --> 38:32.529
beyond what the college deems
to be acceptable limits.

38:32.577 --> 38:33.943
This is important.

38:34.092 --> 38:35.630
You know we're never
going to get the funding

38:35.655 --> 38:37.789
or the permission to do this dig again.

38:37.824 --> 38:40.881
This is the last chance to
prove the settlement existed,

38:40.906 --> 38:42.693
to prove my father was right.

38:42.772 --> 38:44.572
Emma, I hate to say this,

38:44.607 --> 38:46.006
but you are far too influenced

38:46.042 --> 38:48.976
by your desire to rescue
your father's reputation.

38:49.383 --> 38:51.499
Don't you think my
reputation's on the line, too?

38:51.547 --> 38:53.480
Of course it is, as is mine.

38:53.516 --> 38:56.320
I lobbied the board hard to
have them approve this dig.

38:56.523 --> 38:58.707
You have to pull yourself together.

38:58.746 --> 39:00.605
I thought you were here to support me.

39:00.738 --> 39:01.996
Of course I am.

39:02.048 --> 39:03.347
By making me doubt myself?

39:04.035 --> 39:06.082
By saving your career.

39:07.227 --> 39:09.504
It feels like you're trying to end it.

39:10.922 --> 39:13.556
Emma, I'm at a loss that
you could say that to me

39:13.592 --> 39:15.792
after all I've done to champion you.

39:17.210 --> 39:19.377
When the board shuts you down,

39:19.834 --> 39:21.743
don't expect me to defend you.

39:36.415 --> 39:37.747
[Cell phone beeps]

39:57.502 --> 39:59.228
Brigg's dive shop?

39:59.260 --> 40:00.359
Not bad, huh?

40:00.394 --> 40:01.260
Impressive...

40:01.295 --> 40:03.162
Couldn't wait to show you.
You know, you're the first person

40:03.197 --> 40:04.229
I ever went on a dive with.

40:04.265 --> 40:05.431
Aw.

40:05.466 --> 40:06.699
It's a big step.

40:06.734 --> 40:08.333
As in, "are you out of your mind?"

40:08.369 --> 40:09.935
As in, I applaud your courage.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.026
Thank you.

40:11.051 --> 40:12.928
Come in, I want to show you around.

40:19.313 --> 40:21.313
I did my research. Tourism's up.

40:21.348 --> 40:22.181
I just need the right website,

40:22.216 --> 40:24.717
and I'm going to be booked solid...

40:24.752 --> 40:26.085
Which is where you come in,

40:26.120 --> 40:28.220
or at least, I hope so...

40:30.175 --> 40:31.924
That story about the gold coins

40:31.949 --> 40:32.993
and the Queen of England...

40:33.018 --> 40:34.718
I mean, nothing like a little myth

40:34.747 --> 40:36.146
to get the tourists excited.

40:36.409 --> 40:39.425
I was thinking that maybe you could
write something for the website,

40:39.458 --> 40:40.760
something about the possibility

40:40.785 --> 40:42.650
of there maybe being a
chest full of coins?

40:42.675 --> 40:45.761
You know, you being an archaeologist,
it would really mean a lot.

40:46.045 --> 40:46.978
Look, I know...

40:47.417 --> 40:48.946
We haven't seen each
other in a long time,

40:48.982 --> 40:52.116
but... seeing you the other day,

40:52.151 --> 40:54.151
really brought it back, you know...

40:54.187 --> 40:55.586
How I used to feel about you.

40:56.623 --> 40:58.823
Look, Will, I'd like to help you out.

40:58.858 --> 41:00.758
I really would, but...

41:01.088 --> 41:03.522
To put my reputation behind a lie...

41:03.557 --> 41:05.493
I just can't do it.

41:06.227 --> 41:07.960
I'm sorry.

41:12.863 --> 41:14.324
Emma, I'm glad I caught you.

41:14.340 --> 41:15.988
Yeah, it's really blowing here.

41:16.027 --> 41:17.694
I'm worried about your
equipment, your tarps,

41:17.729 --> 41:18.761
anything not tied down.

41:18.797 --> 41:20.329
I'm on my way.

41:20.365 --> 41:22.098
Don't try to do anything on your own.

I'm going to be right behind you.

43:19.550 --> 43:21.035

and minor burns.

43:44.876 --> 43:46.110
We'll keep her here for now

43:46.135 --> 43:48.641
just to be sure that there
aren't any complications.

43:48.673 --> 43:51.373
Now, with some care, I'm sure
she should be just fine.

43:51.409 --> 43:52.374
Oh, thank goodness.

43:52.410 --> 43:53.475
What about Tony Markham?

Superficial burns,

43:54.745 --> 43:56.579
and he's about to be released.

43:56.614 --> 43:58.027
When can I see Pauline?

43:58.106 --> 43:59.306
She needs to rest right now.

43:59.341 --> 44:00.574
I'll let you know when you can see her.

44:00.741 --> 44:02.274
Okay.

44:10.919 --> 44:12.145
Here we go.

44:12.216 --> 44:13.849
Oh, thank you.

44:17.957 --> 44:20.117
So you and Pauline are
really close, huh?

44:20.199 --> 44:20.981
Yeah.

44:21.006 --> 44:23.006
Yeah, my, um...

44:23.365 --> 44:25.607
My parents got divorced when I was 10.

44:26.435 --> 44:27.500
My mom got remarried,

44:27.536 --> 44:30.170
and my dad and I were just
sort of lost for a while.

44:31.502 --> 44:33.335
Then Pauline came into our lives.

44:34.576 --> 44:36.964
I just can't imagine
my life without her.

44:37.940 --> 44:38.982

- Hey.
- Hey.

44:40.730 --> 44:42.276
I am so sorry.

44:42.300 --> 44:44.253
I didn't mean to accuse you of...

44:44.278 --> 44:46.215
No, no. I understand.

44:46.622 --> 44:49.348
I do, I understand.

for saving Pauline.

44:54.215 --> 44:56.849
I will never forget what you did.

44:58.363 --> 45:00.050
I spoke with the sheriff,

45:00.082 --> 45:03.217
and he said that the fire chief was
convinced that this was arson.

45:06.403 --> 45:10.003
a murder, vandalism, and now this...

45:10.644 --> 45:13.645
I mean, for the college and
for the kids and for you,

45:13.873 --> 45:16.318
I can't allow this dig to continue.

45:18.186 --> 45:20.131
I know how hard it is, and I just...

45:20.205 --> 45:22.371
Well, I hope that you understand.

45:23.619 --> 45:25.286
Yeah.

45:25.392 --> 45:26.791
Okay.

45:36.601 --> 45:38.734
Pauline?

45:39.175 --> 45:41.042
Pauline, it's Emma.

45:44.445 --> 45:45.845
It's okay, sweetie.

45:47.721 --> 45:49.053
You rest.

46:08.609 --> 46:09.975
Professor Fielding.

46:10.851 --> 46:12.935
[Joe] We were talking last night.

46:13.258 --> 46:15.421
Everyone's really upset
about being shut down.

46:15.438 --> 46:17.011
We're convinced that we were this close

46:17.036 --> 46:18.591
to proving the colony was here.
If we could just...

46:18.616 --> 46:20.683
Professor Markham is
worried about your safety.

46:21.277 --> 46:22.610
So am I.

46:22.645 --> 46:24.078
That has to be our priority.

46:32.889 --> 46:34.055
How's Pauline?

46:34.380 --> 46:36.557
Better.
Resting.

46:36.943 --> 46:39.227
- How are you?
- Oh, I'm all right.

46:39.262 --> 46:41.107
Burn's a little less than pleasant.

46:42.990 --> 46:45.443
Did the sheriff or agent Connor
have any news?

46:45.468 --> 46:47.968
Unfortunately, nothing so far.

46:49.263 --> 46:50.595
I'm sorry, Emma.

46:51.272 --> 46:52.938
Yeah.

47:25.332 --> 47:26.765
[Knocks]

47:29.169 --> 47:31.837
[Tearful] I sent...
Sending you messages.

47:34.069 --> 47:35.635
Yeah, every 15 minutes. Yeah, I know.

47:35.660 --> 47:37.693
Pauline almost died in this fire,

47:37.729 --> 47:39.908
and it must have been
Tichnor who set it.

47:39.933 --> 47:41.948
- He's the only one...
- It wasn't Tichnor. He has an alibi.

47:41.973 --> 47:44.107
I checked it out. It's solid.

47:47.341 --> 47:49.144
But Pauline's statue!

47:49.207 --> 47:50.941
Pauline's statue, it's always there,

47:50.996 --> 47:52.162
and it's gone,

47:52.197 --> 47:53.997
and Pauline said that Tichnor wanted it.

47:54.366 --> 47:56.288
Are you positive about his alibi?

47:56.313 --> 47:57.589
He was downtown.

47:58.003 --> 47:59.803
Six different people
confirm that they saw him.

48:01.740 --> 48:04.041
Listen, I want to talk
about Will Briggs.

48:04.076 --> 48:05.742
Why do you keep asking me about him?

48:05.778 --> 48:07.448
Well, do you know about his last job?

48:07.529 --> 48:09.129
Yes, salvage diving.

48:09.180 --> 48:11.514
For gold coins off the coast of Florida.

48:11.650 --> 48:14.284
He knows that gold coin
story is nonsense.

48:14.320 --> 48:15.652
We talked about it.

48:16.606 --> 48:17.906
Did you know that he did time?

48:18.090 --> 48:19.056
- What?
- Yeah.

48:19.091 --> 48:19.621
No.

48:19.646 --> 48:21.713
For diving a rig that wasn't
his without a permit,

48:22.095 --> 48:23.394
Which was tantamount to theft.

48:23.419 --> 48:25.602
There have to be two
sides to that story.

48:25.627 --> 48:27.141
When you grow up with someone,

48:27.166 --> 48:29.430
even if I just spent summers here,
you know their character.

48:29.455 --> 48:31.142
Well, people change.

48:31.533 --> 48:32.799
I mean, sometimes, they
do desperate things

48:32.834 --> 48:35.001
when the going gets rough.

48:35.291 --> 48:36.469
No.

48:36.504 --> 48:38.237
I don't believe it.

48:39.774 --> 48:41.641
Look, I understand he's...

48:41.676 --> 48:42.542
He's your friend.

48:42.971 --> 48:44.649
You want to believe
that he's a good guy.

48:44.674 --> 48:46.240
Are you investigating him?

48:46.275 --> 48:48.475
I suggest that you keep
your distance from him.

48:50.049 --> 48:51.248
Listen, uh...

48:51.482 --> 48:53.884
I'll make an inquiry
about Pauline's statue.

48:54.076 --> 48:55.742
I'll file it with the bureau.

49:32.291 --> 49:33.757
- Emma...
- hi.

49:33.793 --> 49:35.926
Hey. I heard about the fire.

49:35.962 --> 49:37.528
I tried calling you. How's Pauline?

49:37.563 --> 49:38.395
Is she okay?

49:38.431 --> 49:39.396
She's better,

49:39.822 --> 49:41.186
but somebody's been doing
everything they can

49:41.211 --> 49:43.059
to get my project shut down.

49:43.281 --> 49:45.748
They don't seem to care
that Pauline was hurt in the process.

49:46.456 --> 49:48.089
That's terrible.

49:49.675 --> 49:51.208
Look, about the other day...

49:51.244 --> 49:52.476
I'm sorry that I asked you

49:52.501 --> 49:54.187
to make up a story about the coins.

49:54.212 --> 49:55.178
I shouldn't have done that.

49:55.290 --> 49:56.389
Forget it.

49:56.494 --> 49:59.187
Listen, I need you to tell
me about Graham Tichnor.

50:00.571 --> 50:03.371
Will, help me. Tell me what you know.

50:03.407 --> 50:05.774
I mean, Tichnor's trouble.

50:05.809 --> 50:09.377
Always looking for an angle,
a way to make a quick buck.

50:10.247 --> 50:11.813
What?

50:13.522 --> 50:15.210
He's been asking about you.

50:33.012 --> 50:33.978
Menu?

50:34.013 --> 50:36.160
Uh, no, thanks. Just a
coffee to go, please.

50:42.622 --> 50:43.688
Thanks.

50:44.254 --> 50:46.054
Sorry to hear about your step-mom.

50:46.334 --> 50:47.033
[Emma]: Thank you.

50:47.068 --> 50:48.201
[Nikki]: She going to be okay?

50:48.236 --> 50:49.068
[Emma]: She is.

50:50.020 --> 50:53.188
So with all the problems
up at the dig site,

50:53.223 --> 50:54.956
does that mean you're going
to have to leave soon?

50:55.418 --> 50:56.891
Not for a while.

50:57.520 --> 50:58.613
Oh.

50:58.862 --> 51:00.862
Well, that'll make Will happy, huh?

51:00.897 --> 51:02.597
You two seem pretty tight.

51:02.632 --> 51:05.033
Hard not to be. We've
known each other forever.

51:05.068 --> 51:07.368
Hey, what do you know
about Graham Tichnor?

51:08.241 --> 51:09.608
Not much.

51:09.898 --> 51:11.163
Like most people around here,

51:11.188 --> 51:13.722
he takes care to mind his own business.

51:16.221 --> 51:17.721
Okay.

51:17.756 --> 51:18.788
Thank you.

51:23.362 --> 51:24.527
First person to respond

51:24.563 --> 51:26.329
gets to come on an adventure with me.

51:33.515 --> 51:34.837
Mrs. Fielding?

51:35.877 --> 51:37.673
Agent Connor, right?

51:37.698 --> 51:39.181
Yeah. I hope you're feeling better.

51:39.299 --> 51:40.331
Mm.

51:40.367 --> 51:44.035
I came to ask you a few questions
about the goddess statue.

51:44.719 --> 51:45.780
My statue?

51:45.805 --> 51:46.755
Yeah, Emma...

51:46.780 --> 51:48.397
I mean, Professor Fielding mentioned

51:48.422 --> 51:50.589
that it was missing after the fire.

51:50.846 --> 51:52.145
Oh, no.

51:53.136 --> 51:56.371
My husband, Oscar, found
it on a dig in Bangladesh

51:56.562 --> 51:58.395
about 20 years ago.

51:59.609 --> 52:01.776
Can you provide any more details?

52:01.811 --> 52:04.846
I'll search for Oscar's
file when I get home.

52:04.881 --> 52:07.081
It'll have everything you need.

52:07.117 --> 52:09.284
You can always count on an archaeologist

52:09.319 --> 52:10.952
to be detail-oriented.

52:11.450 --> 52:12.416
Yes...

52:12.451 --> 52:13.984
I know.

52:14.883 --> 52:15.982
Uh...

52:17.997 --> 52:19.233
Professor Fielding,

52:19.258 --> 52:21.625
has she always been so...

52:21.801 --> 52:22.900
Uh...

52:22.935 --> 52:24.401
Challenging?

52:24.780 --> 52:27.104
If she weren't...

52:27.366 --> 52:30.100
Would you find her as interesting?

52:34.602 --> 52:36.768
Thank you.

52:46.358 --> 52:48.759
Why are we spying on Professor Fielding?

52:48.794 --> 52:50.834
Because Emma Fielding is in trouble.

52:50.863 --> 52:52.129
The body at the dig site,

52:52.173 --> 52:53.140
the stolen map.

52:53.165 --> 52:54.431
The fire at Pauline's...

52:55.741 --> 52:58.108
Look. she must be on to something.

52:58.237 --> 52:59.703
What makes you think that?

52:59.739 --> 53:01.848
Because that's what I would do.

53:01.872 --> 53:02.937
Wait, so what do we do?

53:02.973 --> 53:04.138
We follow.

53:04.174 --> 53:05.139
I don't know, Carey...

53:05.175 --> 53:06.641
Come on...

53:06.676 --> 53:07.997
And get your drone.

53:14.050 --> 53:15.016
[Car approaching]

53:47.153 --> 53:49.186
[Doorbell rings]

53:52.589 --> 53:53.955
[Doorbell rings]

54:11.501 --> 54:13.079
[Graham]: Shopping for collectibles?

54:15.697 --> 54:18.947
Yes, Mr. Tichnor, I am
looking for collectibles,

54:18.982 --> 54:20.648
both extremely rare...

54:20.684 --> 54:21.916
And missing.

54:22.807 --> 54:26.234
And you think you'll find them here?

54:26.352 --> 54:28.619
You're perfectly welcome to look around.

54:33.146 --> 54:36.080
There's no need to be
nervous, Ms. Fielding.

54:55.936 --> 54:57.703
Could you take any longer?

54:57.738 --> 54:59.738
You want it done fast, or done right?

54:59.774 --> 55:00.939
Just get the thing in the air, will you?

55:00.975 --> 55:02.574
So, done right, then.

55:25.166 --> 55:26.665
[Carey]: There's her car,
but where's the Professor?

55:27.347 --> 55:29.481
I don't know.

55:37.184 --> 55:38.650
I'd offer you refreshments,

55:38.708 --> 55:41.242
but I don't think it's
that kind of visit.

55:41.348 --> 55:42.614
Too bad.

55:44.151 --> 55:45.760
Tea might have been
nice while we discuss

55:45.785 --> 55:47.644
what you took from my stepmother...

55:47.707 --> 55:48.806
And my dig.

55:49.359 --> 55:52.367
If you're accusing me of larceny,

55:52.438 --> 55:53.943
you're barking up the wrong tree.

55:54.445 --> 55:56.779
I don't bark, Mr. Tichnor...

55:57.351 --> 55:59.081
I bite,

55:59.117 --> 56:01.350
especially when you nearly
killed someone I care about.

56:02.025 --> 56:03.786
So now I'm an arsonist and murderer

56:03.822 --> 56:04.921
as well as a thief.

56:06.391 --> 56:08.564
I was nowhere near her place last night.

56:08.866 --> 56:12.334
Agent Connor knows my
alibi is rock solid...

56:13.504 --> 56:15.270
And now, Professor...

56:17.297 --> 56:19.323
I'm afraid it's closing time.

56:49.227 --> 56:50.938
[Carey]: It looks like she's leaving.

56:51.023 --> 56:53.090
Hmm, guess she didn't need us after all.

56:53.407 --> 56:54.506
Stay on him.

56:54.531 --> 56:56.197
Make sure he doesn't go after her.

57:02.080 --> 57:03.412
[Engine starts]

57:13.858 --> 57:15.795
[Connor]: <i> You've reached
agent James Connor.</i>

57:15.820 --> 57:16.897
<i>Leave a message.</i>

57:16.952 --> 57:18.631
Connor, I'm going to meet
Pauline at the hospital.

57:18.656 --> 57:20.422
Can you meet me? It's urgent.

57:29.016 --> 57:30.015
Emma!

57:30.242 --> 57:32.517
Hey!

57:32.553 --> 57:35.287
I just got some good news from
the doctor about your lungs.

57:35.322 --> 57:37.390
Said you're doing much better.

57:37.617 --> 57:39.427
What happened?

57:39.545 --> 57:40.577
I don't know.

57:40.613 --> 57:43.247
I couldn't find my way out.

57:43.282 --> 57:44.915
Everything was such a blur.

57:45.791 --> 57:47.724
I'm so happy you're okay.

57:48.988 --> 57:52.542
The police think that someone may
have set the fire intentionally.

57:53.222 --> 57:54.558
Really?

57:54.593 --> 57:57.222
Yeah, I'm... I'm afraid this
is all because of me...

57:57.269 --> 57:59.269
My dig, my investigating.

57:59.328 --> 58:01.061
I just can't do this if it's going to...

58:01.183 --> 58:03.209
No, don't you back down now.

58:03.288 --> 58:05.655
You do what you do best...

58:05.798 --> 58:07.231
Uncover the truth.

58:07.439 --> 58:09.875
No. Look, the dig is important,

58:09.927 --> 58:11.894
but it's not as important as you.

58:12.038 --> 58:13.838
I don't even know if I'm right.

58:14.993 --> 58:16.859
When your father published
his first paper

58:16.884 --> 58:18.484
about the lost colony,

58:18.575 --> 58:19.875
it was scoffed at

58:20.052 --> 58:22.052
by the entire archaeological community,

58:22.087 --> 58:24.076
but your father knew in his heart

58:24.140 --> 58:25.439
that he was on to something.

58:25.943 --> 58:27.658
Even though it seemed crazy?

58:27.693 --> 58:30.661
I knew anyone with that much
conviction and determination,

58:30.696 --> 58:32.663
they couldn't be wrong.

58:35.005 --> 58:38.006
That's why I believe in you too, Emma.

58:42.074 --> 58:43.740
Hey, Professor!

58:43.776 --> 58:45.375
Oh, hey, good, you got my message.

58:45.411 --> 58:46.810
Listen, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

58:46.846 --> 58:48.378
There's been another suspicious death.

58:48.414 --> 58:50.814
- What?
- Graham Tichnor.

58:50.850 --> 58:52.182
I just saw him!

58:53.000 --> 58:53.798
You... when? Where?

58:53.834 --> 58:56.334
At his house, about two hours ago.

58:56.718 --> 58:58.718
Well, that's when the
medical examiner estimates

58:58.746 --> 58:59.912
that he was killed.

58:59.947 --> 59:00.913
You may have been

59:00.948 --> 59:02.448
the last person to see him alive.

59:08.341 --> 59:10.074
Explain it to me, Emma.

59:10.109 --> 59:12.109
What were you doing here
in the first place?

59:12.144 --> 59:14.578
I was convinced he set
the fire at Pauline's,

59:14.614 --> 59:17.017
and I thought, if I could
find her statue...

59:17.315 --> 59:18.281
[Sheriff]: Did you?

59:18.316 --> 59:19.115
No...

59:19.620 --> 59:20.955
But I did find beads

59:21.002 --> 59:22.517
that match the one I found on the beach.

59:22.542 --> 59:23.994
They're right out on the table.

59:24.026 --> 59:25.725
Connor told me about your bead theory.

59:25.761 --> 59:26.693
Just not sure

59:26.728 --> 59:29.162
that it actually adds up
to proof of anything.

59:29.817 --> 59:32.426
In any case, you're going to
have to make a statement.

59:33.059 --> 59:34.501
Graham Tichnor was alive and kicking

59:34.536 --> 59:36.036
when I saw him last.

59:36.071 --> 59:37.037
That's my statement.

59:37.072 --> 59:38.705
Not quite good enough.

59:39.044 --> 59:40.677
Agent Connor, you mind?

59:43.000 --> 59:44.266
Okay, yep.

59:44.379 --> 59:46.346
Let's get it over with.

59:49.851 --> 59:51.621
Whose side are you on?

59:51.707 --> 59:53.957
Well, justice doesn't take sides.

59:53.989 --> 59:55.188
The fact that I was at a crime scene

59:55.223 --> 59:56.222
in both instances...

59:56.258 --> 59:58.224
Is more than a coincidence.
I understand that.

59:58.260 --> 59:59.993
Look, I'm sorry. I don't mean to be...

01:00:00.028 --> 01:00:01.594
Condescending to me?

01:00:02.798 --> 01:00:05.031
I already said I'm sorry.

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.534
I'm just saying that
I'm the common link,

01:00:07.569 --> 01:00:09.279
which means I could be next.

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:11.638
Don't think for one second
I'd let that happen...

01:00:12.265 --> 01:00:14.017
Unless, of course, you
do something crazy.

01:00:14.096 --> 01:00:15.099
Such as?

01:00:15.124 --> 01:00:16.269
Well, how 'bout going to meet a suspect

01:00:16.294 --> 01:00:17.226
without me being there.

01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:19.079
Oh, now Tichnor's a suspect?

01:00:19.114 --> 01:00:20.613
You sat there nodding like a bobble-head

01:00:20.649 --> 01:00:21.848
when Stannard was saying

01:00:21.883 --> 01:00:24.317
- "Oh, he has nothing to do with any of this!"
- I didn't nod like a bobble-head.

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:25.296
Okay, look, look...

01:00:25.321 --> 01:00:28.209
Will said that Tichnor
kept trying to involve him

01:00:28.234 --> 01:00:29.200
in some scheme.

01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:31.750
Well, if Tichnor's the mastermind,
then who killed him?

01:00:32.094 --> 01:00:34.561
I have no idea.

01:00:35.355 --> 01:00:37.563
Listen, you've got to
stand down, Emma...

01:00:37.704 --> 01:00:38.703
Professor.

01:00:39.079 --> 01:00:40.508
Emma Professor.

01:00:40.566 --> 01:00:42.366
Has a nice ring.

01:00:43.002 --> 01:00:44.815
You have a talent for detection...

01:00:45.573 --> 01:00:47.145
And a photographic memory, but...

01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:48.146
Eidetic.

01:00:48.181 --> 01:00:49.180
What?

01:00:49.216 --> 01:00:51.104
I have an eidetic memory,

01:00:51.129 --> 01:00:54.654
an enhanced ability to vividly
recall images from memory.

01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.849
Okay.

01:00:56.021 --> 01:00:59.691
Look I know that you and Tony want
me to pack up and go home, know

01:00:59.726 --> 01:01:01.474
but I can't leave...

01:01:01.571 --> 01:01:03.404
Not when Pauline's in
this kind of shape.

01:01:03.597 --> 01:01:04.919
Okay, I understand that,

01:01:05.107 --> 01:01:08.106
But you need to just take yourself
out of the line of fire...

01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:09.670
Literally.

01:01:23.690 --> 01:01:25.089
Hey, get you something?

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:26.324
Just a black coffee.

01:01:29.596 --> 01:01:31.353
Any news on your investigation, agent?

01:01:31.623 --> 01:01:33.156
I mean, that you can talk about?

01:01:33.455 --> 01:01:34.632
Hey...

01:01:35.026 --> 01:01:36.526
Have you had any inquiries

01:01:36.561 --> 01:01:39.529
from collectors of recovered artifacts?

01:01:39.564 --> 01:01:41.397
Not recently. Why?

01:01:41.433 --> 01:01:42.999
[Connor]: We think that
this might be the work

01:01:43.034 --> 01:01:45.535
of an international art theft ring.

01:01:45.570 --> 01:01:47.337
We've been tracking
them in the northeast.

01:01:47.372 --> 01:01:50.707
There've been robberies
at museums, digs.

01:01:50.742 --> 01:01:51.710
Really?

01:01:51.804 --> 01:01:53.877
So you don't think it's somebody local
from here, no?

01:01:54.358 --> 01:01:55.512
Well, that's their method.

01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:58.548
They hire local people
to do the dirty work.

01:01:58.583 --> 01:02:00.483
That would explain the
Augie-Tichnor connection.

01:02:01.124 --> 01:02:03.052
Huh, that's interesting.

01:02:13.632 --> 01:02:15.159
[Loud thud]

01:02:15.934 --> 01:02:17.700
Hello?

01:02:22.302 --> 01:02:23.835
Hello?

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.719
[Screams]

01:02:37.213 --> 01:02:38.545
Tony!

01:02:38.581 --> 01:02:40.284
- Emma!
- You scared me.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:42.133
Well, I guess we're both
a little bit jumpy.

01:02:42.168 --> 01:02:43.434
[Exhales]

01:02:43.470 --> 01:02:46.003
Thank you for looking
before swinging, though.

01:02:46.039 --> 01:02:47.972
I appreciate that.

01:02:48.007 --> 01:02:49.407
What are you doing here?

01:02:49.442 --> 01:02:50.608
Cleaning up.

01:02:50.643 --> 01:02:51.524
You?

01:02:51.562 --> 01:02:53.295
Oh, I just had to pick up some files.

01:02:53.792 --> 01:02:54.891
How's Pauline?

01:02:54.977 --> 01:02:56.086
Improving.

01:02:56.111 --> 01:02:58.077
They want to monitor her
lung for a couple more days.

01:02:58.180 --> 01:02:59.969
- That's understandable, I guess.
- Yeah.

01:03:00.046 --> 01:03:02.678
It's infuriating that they haven't
figured out who's responsible.

01:03:02.703 --> 01:03:05.476
At least the fire was contained
to the second floor, though.

01:03:05.664 --> 01:03:06.529
I bumped into agent Connor.

01:03:06.565 --> 01:03:08.465
He had some interesting things to say

01:03:08.508 --> 01:03:10.274
that may shed some light
on the situation.

01:03:10.302 --> 01:03:12.045
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:12.153 --> 01:03:13.486
News to me.

01:03:14.773 --> 01:03:16.239
Look...

01:03:16.274 --> 01:03:19.409
I'm sorry about how all
of this has played out.

01:03:20.411 --> 01:03:21.928
Yeah.

01:03:23.482 --> 01:03:25.014
Well, good night.

01:03:37.007 --> 01:03:38.128
Hey, Professor?

01:03:38.163 --> 01:03:39.129
Hey!

01:03:39.172 --> 01:03:40.664
We're heading back to the dig.

01:03:40.689 --> 01:03:43.390
I want to map the site one
more time with my drone.

01:03:44.024 --> 01:03:45.791
Do you want to come with us?

01:03:45.826 --> 01:03:47.234
Sure.

01:03:47.274 --> 01:03:48.607
So, Carey,

01:03:48.642 --> 01:03:50.809
sounds like Joe's winning
you over to his side.

01:03:50.845 --> 01:03:52.511
Not entirely.

01:03:52.546 --> 01:03:54.513
Hey, is there any news
from agent Connor yet?

01:03:54.548 --> 01:03:56.081
Going to have to ask him yourself.

01:03:56.117 --> 01:03:57.816
Whatever he knows, he's not telling me.

01:04:06.994 --> 01:04:08.460
[Connor]: Professor?

01:04:08.496 --> 01:04:10.262
Connor! look, look! I found a bead.

01:04:10.297 --> 01:04:12.331
It's a match to the worry
beads, and Tichnor dropped it

01:04:12.366 --> 01:04:13.599
right here, right where
he would have been

01:04:13.634 --> 01:04:14.633
dragging the body into the trench...

01:04:14.668 --> 01:04:16.001
We have something more
important to talk about.

01:04:16.036 --> 01:04:17.636
The toxicology report came back.

01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:19.403
Tichnor was poisoned.

01:04:19.428 --> 01:04:20.428
What?

01:04:20.453 --> 01:04:22.640
<i>Agrostemma Githago,</i> a plant
that's found in this area.

01:04:22.665 --> 01:04:24.593
I know what it is. I
wrote a paper about it.

01:04:24.618 --> 01:04:26.668
You wrote the definitive
paper on its use as a poison

01:04:26.693 --> 01:04:28.030
in the 17th century.

01:04:28.124 --> 01:04:29.090
I know.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:30.592
[Sheriff]: Professor Fielding?

01:04:31.148 --> 01:04:33.187
Going to have to ask
you to come with us.

01:04:33.212 --> 01:04:36.587
We have some questions
about the murder of Graham Tichnor.

01:04:42.986 --> 01:04:45.553
[Sheriff]: It's much more
than a coincidence, Emma.

01:04:45.675 --> 01:04:47.385
Graham Tichnor, poisoned,

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.217
with a plant that you've researched,

01:04:49.252 --> 01:04:51.285
after you were the last
one to see him alive.

01:04:51.659 --> 01:04:54.226
But anybody who read my paper
would know about that poison.

01:04:54.261 --> 01:04:55.344
Maybe so,

01:04:55.369 --> 01:04:57.632
but we know you were there
around the time he died,

01:04:57.657 --> 01:05:00.024
and... you have a motive.

01:05:00.446 --> 01:05:01.678
What motive?

01:05:01.721 --> 01:05:03.719
Agent Connor says you
were pretty worked up

01:05:03.744 --> 01:05:06.776
about his raiding your site
and nearly killing Pauline.

01:05:06.801 --> 01:05:08.234
[Knocking on door]

01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:18.953
[Carey]: Have you
people lost your minds?

01:05:18.977 --> 01:05:19.810
Professor Fielding never could have...

01:05:19.845 --> 01:05:21.993
What she means to say, agent Connor,

01:05:22.018 --> 01:05:24.821
is that we have proof
that Professor Fielding is innocent.

01:05:24.846 --> 01:05:25.778
Proof?

01:05:25.852 --> 01:05:26.908
Take a look.

01:05:26.962 --> 01:05:28.525
Watch the time code.

01:05:28.581 --> 01:05:30.291
She was in Tichnor's house four minutes.

01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.052
She left, and he followed her out.

01:05:32.077 --> 01:05:32.989
See?

01:05:33.024 --> 01:05:34.958
[Joe]: The poison takes
effect immediately,

01:05:35.283 --> 01:05:36.903
so if she gave it to him
while they were together,

01:05:36.928 --> 01:05:38.161
he couldn't have walked out of his house

01:05:38.186 --> 01:05:39.118
a few minutes later.

01:05:39.598 --> 01:05:41.097
Tichnor was alive

01:05:41.132 --> 01:05:42.198
when the Professor left.

01:05:42.436 --> 01:05:43.435
Good work.

01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.672
[Tony]: Come on in, everybody.

01:05:58.149 --> 01:06:00.711
I just wanted to say my goodbye.

01:06:01.109 --> 01:06:03.309
I'm headed back to the
college this afternoon,

01:06:03.334 --> 01:06:05.445
as you continue to wrap up the site,

01:06:05.501 --> 01:06:08.301
and though we were unsuccessful here,

01:06:08.827 --> 01:06:11.958
I think that you all gained
invaluable experience

01:06:11.983 --> 01:06:14.918
working under our most lauded
Professor Emma Fielding.

01:06:16.919 --> 01:06:20.434
[Emma]: Thank you. Thank
you, Professor Markham...

01:06:20.513 --> 01:06:22.856
And I just want to thank all of you

01:06:22.919 --> 01:06:24.919
for digging your hearts out.

01:06:25.243 --> 01:06:26.543
Thank you.

01:06:29.359 --> 01:06:30.158
Thank you.

01:06:30.193 --> 01:06:31.759
Thank you.

01:06:31.795 --> 01:06:32.760
Thanks, Professor.

01:06:32.796 --> 01:06:34.062
Thank you.

01:06:35.690 --> 01:06:37.723
Aw, nicely done.

01:06:37.748 --> 01:06:40.382
[Carey]: I just can't
believe this is the end.

01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:42.050
All our work down the drain.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:43.187
It's not so bad.

01:06:43.212 --> 01:06:44.345
Like Professor Markham said,

01:06:44.370 --> 01:06:46.503
we did gain valuable dig experience.

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:50.471
Okay, yeah, it's pretty bad.

01:06:53.057 --> 01:06:54.122
Guys...

01:06:54.376 --> 01:06:56.335
I heard agent Connor talking
about the case last night.

01:06:56.360 --> 01:06:58.160
He was saying this whole
thing could be the work

01:06:58.195 --> 01:06:59.908
of an international ring of art thieves.

01:07:00.025 --> 01:07:02.579
Their technique is to use local people
to steal precious artifacts.

01:07:02.642 --> 01:07:04.742
Wait, but Augie and
Tichnor are both dead,

01:07:04.778 --> 01:07:06.562
so who could the local person be?

01:07:06.649 --> 01:07:08.394
Lakshmi, goddess of prosperity.

01:07:08.433 --> 01:07:10.511
- Who?
- Pauline's goddess statue.

01:07:10.552 --> 01:07:11.548
She showed it to me.

01:07:11.573 --> 01:07:13.606
Professor Fielding said it was missing.

01:07:13.642 --> 01:07:15.709
You're thinking they'd
be after that statue.

01:07:16.847 --> 01:07:17.913
So if we find the statue...

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.294
We find the thief.

01:07:54.285 --> 01:07:55.410
Got it!

01:07:56.139 --> 01:07:57.205
That's the one?

01:07:57.237 --> 01:07:59.688
Yup. there are only four in
existence, including Pauline's.

01:08:00.230 --> 01:08:01.523
Okay.

01:08:02.042 --> 01:08:03.090
So...

01:08:03.269 --> 01:08:06.805
Who had the motive and the opportunity?

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:08.400
Professor Fielding's always saying

01:08:08.425 --> 01:08:11.236
it's not just how to
dig, it's where to dig.

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:12.768
Hmm.

01:08:14.310 --> 01:08:15.810
[Footsteps]

01:08:16.587 --> 01:08:17.975
Hey...

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.734
Does looking like a bad boy suggest...

01:08:21.926 --> 01:08:23.526
That you really are bad?

01:08:23.562 --> 01:08:24.694
[Motorcycle revs]

01:08:34.923 --> 01:08:35.822
Enjoy.

01:08:38.654 --> 01:08:39.955
Nikki?

01:08:40.018 --> 01:08:41.417
I need to talk to you outside.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.877
I can't get away. We're too busy.

01:08:44.100 --> 01:08:45.500
It's about Will.

01:08:47.658 --> 01:08:49.457
Cover for me, will ya?

01:08:58.970 --> 01:09:01.270
So where are we going? I
don't have much time.

01:09:01.305 --> 01:09:03.439
Trust me, you're going
to want to hear this.

01:09:03.474 --> 01:09:05.374
Get in. It's important.

01:09:13.178 --> 01:09:14.283
What?

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:15.718
I need to show you something.

01:09:15.859 --> 01:09:17.825
No way. I can't go with you.

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:19.986
Can't, or won't?

01:09:24.055 --> 01:09:25.154
What's the matter, Nikki?

01:09:25.283 --> 01:09:27.550
Afraid there's something
wrong with my car?

01:09:27.616 --> 01:09:30.053
- I know you cut my brake line.
- What?

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.999
Are you trying to scare me?

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.734
Like how you trashed my hotel room?

01:09:35.045 --> 01:09:37.358
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:09:37.383 --> 01:09:40.640
You know, agent Connor hasn't found
a match for those fingerprints.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:43.053
Bet he'd love to check yours.

01:09:43.078 --> 01:09:45.912
You can talk to him,
or you can talk to me.

01:09:46.024 --> 01:09:47.258
It's your call.

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.420
It's Will you should be questioning.

01:09:56.975 --> 01:09:58.154
Why?

01:09:58.217 --> 01:09:59.967
Yeah, you don't know.

01:10:00.006 --> 01:10:01.940
You were only here summers.

01:10:01.975 --> 01:10:03.308
He'd see you

01:10:03.343 --> 01:10:06.077
and get on his best behavior.

01:10:07.013 --> 01:10:09.314
You don't want to believe it?

01:10:09.529 --> 01:10:12.930
You won't be the first woman
to fall for his lies.

01:10:27.601 --> 01:10:29.535
He looks totally distracted.

01:10:29.570 --> 01:10:31.370
Let's go for it.

01:10:41.912 --> 01:10:43.745
It's locked.

01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:52.008
Okay, he's down in his boat.

01:10:52.356 --> 01:10:53.755
Maybe we could break in.

01:10:54.505 --> 01:10:56.105
We could also do a five-year stretch

01:10:56.130 --> 01:10:57.630
for breaking and entering.

01:10:57.655 --> 01:11:00.489
I signed up for an
adventure, not a felony.

01:11:00.764 --> 01:11:02.292
Okay, well, maybe...

01:11:02.317 --> 01:11:03.816
He hid the statue outside the shop.

01:11:04.068 --> 01:11:06.468
That way, if he got busted,
he could claim it wasn't his.

01:11:07.223 --> 01:11:09.656
Sure, I mean, it's a long
shot, but what the heck.

01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:10.833
You keep an eye on the boat.

01:11:10.908 --> 01:11:12.141
Got it.

01:11:34.665 --> 01:11:35.864
Hey, Carey!

01:11:56.628 --> 01:11:58.127
Whew.

01:11:59.623 --> 01:12:00.589
Sorry.

01:12:00.624 --> 01:12:01.890
Okay! just...

01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:06.941
Will?

01:12:06.996 --> 01:12:08.695
Hey, em. What's going on?

01:12:08.731 --> 01:12:10.597
Exactly what I came here to ask you.

01:12:12.826 --> 01:12:15.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What're you doing?
We're drifting from the dock.

01:12:15.773 --> 01:12:17.858
Yeah, just taking her for a test spin.
I just tuned her up.

01:12:17.883 --> 01:12:19.383
No, no, Will, forget it. I can't...

01:12:19.408 --> 01:12:20.656
We'll be quick. You
probably haven't been

01:12:20.681 --> 01:12:21.726
on the water since you've been back.

01:12:21.764 --> 01:12:22.577
Will...

01:12:36.232 --> 01:12:37.965
She's leaving with him.

01:12:40.313 --> 01:12:42.313
This isn't good.

01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:44.470
You can say that again.

01:13:09.843 --> 01:13:12.483
Remember when we used to come
to this cove when we were kids,

01:13:12.508 --> 01:13:15.209
talk about what we'd do with our lives?

01:13:16.116 --> 01:13:17.849
I used to dream about
that back when I was...

01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:19.299
In jail?

01:13:23.924 --> 01:13:25.691
Yes, actually.

01:13:26.054 --> 01:13:27.821
What happened?

01:13:29.598 --> 01:13:32.165
Desperation met stupidity...

01:13:32.787 --> 01:13:34.987
On the corner of back luck.

01:13:35.924 --> 01:13:38.959
No excuses. Only regrets.

01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:43.196
Will, I have to ask you something.

01:13:43.943 --> 01:13:45.223
Em, look,

01:13:45.248 --> 01:13:47.192
I had nothing to do with any of this.

01:13:47.713 --> 01:13:48.712
Tichnor talked to you.

01:13:48.882 --> 01:13:50.748
Now he's dead.

01:13:50.795 --> 01:13:52.420
My dig's been shut down.

01:13:52.467 --> 01:13:54.733
Your girlfriend, Nikki,
sabotaged my car.

01:13:55.355 --> 01:13:56.821
She what?

01:13:57.592 --> 01:13:59.521
Okay, first of all, she's
not my girlfriend,

01:13:59.546 --> 01:14:01.248
so whatever she did, I
knew nothing about it.

01:14:01.272 --> 01:14:03.839
So Tichnor, Augie, Nikki...

01:14:03.875 --> 01:14:05.474
Everybody's guilty but you?

01:14:06.642 --> 01:14:07.874
Okay.

01:14:09.328 --> 01:14:12.000
I haven't exactly been forthcoming,
I'll admit it.

01:14:12.127 --> 01:14:13.790
Tichnor wanted to get
his hands on your map,

01:14:13.815 --> 01:14:15.416
but I told him I wanted
nothing to do with it,

01:14:15.441 --> 01:14:17.768
and that I would report him if he tried.

01:14:18.221 --> 01:14:21.135
Then when I found out that your map
had been stolen, I confronted him.

01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:22.834
He swore up and down it wasn't him.

01:14:22.939 --> 01:14:24.131
And you believed him?

01:14:24.159 --> 01:14:26.059
Didn't matter if I believed him or not.

01:14:26.196 --> 01:14:28.530
I can't afford any trouble,
not with my record.

01:14:28.565 --> 01:14:30.865
So you let trouble come to me?

01:14:34.505 --> 01:14:36.605
He rented my boat... Tichnor.

01:14:36.671 --> 01:14:37.870
Paid me a lot of money.

01:14:38.008 --> 01:14:39.340
I didn't ask him any questions,

01:14:39.376 --> 01:14:40.591
didn't know where he was going with it,

01:14:40.662 --> 01:14:43.234
and then the next day,
when I was out on the water,

01:14:43.334 --> 01:14:46.235
the day Augie's body was found...

01:14:46.302 --> 01:14:49.337
I saw what was going on
over at your dig site.

01:14:49.544 --> 01:14:50.810
You lied to me about that.

01:14:50.994 --> 01:14:53.548
I saw a yellow jacket,
the one that Augie wore.

01:14:53.573 --> 01:14:55.319
It was on my boat,

01:14:55.477 --> 01:14:56.976
so I figured he was
on here with Tichnor.

01:14:57.017 --> 01:14:58.192
Look, I didn't want to go to jail,

01:14:58.217 --> 01:14:59.353
so I threw it overboard.

01:14:59.378 --> 01:15:00.945
Why didn't you come to me?

01:15:01.169 --> 01:15:02.301
What could you have done?

01:15:02.570 --> 01:15:05.268
They would have said that I
was an accessory to murder,

01:15:05.293 --> 01:15:07.393
a murder that I swear I
had nothing to do with.

01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:08.893
Will...

01:15:08.933 --> 01:15:10.651
They're not going to believe me!

01:15:11.315 --> 01:15:12.869
I'm a criminal, right?

01:15:13.750 --> 01:15:15.851
Even you think that.

01:15:16.507 --> 01:15:17.807
[Phone beeps]

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:24.631
What?

01:15:25.463 --> 01:15:27.363
What is it?

01:15:28.294 --> 01:15:30.261
They found my map and Pauline's statue

01:15:30.296 --> 01:15:32.497
hidden behind your dive shop.

01:15:32.532 --> 01:15:34.071
No.

01:15:34.845 --> 01:15:35.978
That's not right.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:37.340
Did you set the fire?

01:15:37.827 --> 01:15:39.665
No! I love Pauline.

01:15:39.690 --> 01:15:41.514
- Did you kill Augie?
- No!

01:15:41.597 --> 01:15:43.866
- Tichnor?
- Absolutely not! Emma, come on, it's me!

01:15:43.891 --> 01:15:44.756
You know me!

01:15:44.781 --> 01:15:46.113
What do I know, Will?

01:15:46.528 --> 01:15:48.635
Look, I have made some
mistakes in my life,

01:15:48.660 --> 01:15:51.137
but I am not about to let
you send me back to jail!

01:15:56.800 --> 01:15:57.766
[Emma]: Take me back.

01:15:59.503 --> 01:16:01.234
Take me back.

01:16:01.259 --> 01:16:02.992
Look, I'm sorry.

01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:08.720
Em... I...

01:16:09.993 --> 01:16:11.692
[Police siren wails]

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:16.516
Everything I told you
is the whole truth.

01:16:16.603 --> 01:16:18.907
I promise, I had nothing
to do with the murder,

01:16:18.932 --> 01:16:21.055
the fire, or anything else.

01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:34.085
Hey!

01:16:34.121 --> 01:16:35.682
- Hey.
- You okay?

01:16:35.761 --> 01:16:36.993
Yeah.

01:16:37.029 --> 01:16:39.262
Good timing on that police boat.

01:16:39.298 --> 01:16:40.597
Oh, well, yeah.

01:16:40.632 --> 01:16:42.532
You have to thank Joe
and Carey for that,

01:16:42.567 --> 01:16:44.567
and for recovering your
statue and your map.

01:16:44.603 --> 01:16:47.203
It was at Will's dive shop.

01:16:47.239 --> 01:16:49.706
I don't think he's the
one who took them.

01:16:51.376 --> 01:16:52.042
You think he's not involved?

01:16:52.077 --> 01:16:53.743
No, no, I think he's involved.

01:16:53.779 --> 01:16:55.779
I just think there's something more,

01:16:55.814 --> 01:16:57.280
something we're missing.

01:16:57.316 --> 01:16:58.682
Okay.

01:16:58.717 --> 01:17:00.884
I'm going to go talk to him now.

01:17:00.919 --> 01:17:01.851
I'll talk to you later.

01:17:01.887 --> 01:17:04.888
Okay. I'm going to go take one
last look at the dig site.

01:17:39.857 --> 01:17:40.889
Emma.

01:17:43.195 --> 01:17:45.818
I see you didn't leave town.

01:17:46.624 --> 01:17:48.891
Couldn't wait to get
your hands dirty, huh?

01:17:49.634 --> 01:17:52.946
Every trench needs a proper hard edge
to measure depth.

01:17:53.438 --> 01:17:57.006
My father taught me to keep
that edge facing the sunrise.

01:17:57.042 --> 01:17:58.508
Taught you, too.

01:17:58.543 --> 01:18:01.077
Lessons from the great Oscar Fielding.

01:18:01.113 --> 01:18:04.114
Yeah, apparently, you slept
through some of yours,

01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:07.350
otherwise you might've lived
up to your potential,

01:18:07.386 --> 01:18:08.752
made some discoveries of your own

01:18:08.787 --> 01:18:10.920
instead of killing to steal mine.

01:18:12.874 --> 01:18:15.271
Well, the FBI seems to
be under the impression

01:18:15.296 --> 01:18:18.764
that there is an international
art theft ring at work here.

01:18:18.826 --> 01:18:19.889
Yeah.

01:18:19.968 --> 01:18:23.194
That was agent Connor sowing
a little misinformation,

01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:26.330
Like you did with Augie and Tichnor
when you told them I was searching

01:18:26.355 --> 01:18:28.421
for the Queen of England’s gold coins.

01:18:28.714 --> 01:18:30.769
Is that how you got them
to interfere with my dig?

01:18:30.799 --> 01:18:32.466
Then they got out of your control?

01:18:32.641 --> 01:18:34.198
Augie threatened me.

01:18:34.278 --> 01:18:37.245
Tichnor started searching for
the treasure on his own.

01:18:37.355 --> 01:18:38.988
So you killed them both,

01:18:39.024 --> 01:18:41.224
then you set the fire at Pauline's,

01:18:41.635 --> 01:18:43.002
framed Will.

01:18:43.072 --> 01:18:45.281
That's quite a mess of accusations.

01:18:45.730 --> 01:18:47.363
And why would I do that?

01:18:48.151 --> 01:18:51.205
This whole time,
you've been trying to shut down my site,

01:18:51.570 --> 01:18:53.900
take the glory for yourself.

01:18:54.011 --> 01:18:55.744
You knew we were going
to find something here,

01:18:56.457 --> 01:18:57.970
prove my father right.

01:18:58.061 --> 01:19:01.863
Your father may have been
an absolute Saint to you,

01:19:01.888 --> 01:19:04.489
but he was not to me.

01:19:04.871 --> 01:19:07.906
He criticized my research.

01:19:07.933 --> 01:19:09.366
He dismissed my proposals.

01:19:09.391 --> 01:19:11.980
He belittled me at every turn.

01:19:12.886 --> 01:19:16.191
He did everything that he
could to ensure my failure.

01:19:16.268 --> 01:19:19.102
I just needed some additional proof here

01:19:20.102 --> 01:19:22.307
that this is the right place.

01:19:22.406 --> 01:19:23.846
After some time,

01:19:23.984 --> 01:19:25.951
I'd secure some more financing

01:19:26.391 --> 01:19:28.878
and reopen the dig...

01:19:28.954 --> 01:19:29.986
My dig.

01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:34.337
Do you really think I'm not
going to say anything?

01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:37.427
Do you think I'm going to let you
take all of this away from me?

01:19:38.224 --> 01:19:42.310
Well, I had hoped that
you would be smart.

01:19:43.537 --> 01:19:49.655
Like I said before, your drive, your
urge to prove your father right

01:19:49.730 --> 01:19:54.351
is far too great, so, unfortunately,

01:19:54.445 --> 01:19:58.336
I won't be able
to let you leave here alive.

01:20:24.270 --> 01:20:25.736
Emma!

01:20:36.582 --> 01:20:39.750
There's only one way
this is going to end.

01:20:39.785 --> 01:20:41.675
Emma!

01:20:41.742 --> 01:20:43.609
There's no point in running.

01:20:51.998 --> 01:20:53.931
Best give up now.

01:20:53.993 --> 01:20:55.659
You can't win this.

01:20:55.732 --> 01:20:56.898
We'll see.

01:20:58.009 --> 01:21:00.176
[Connor]: I don't know, Markham.

01:21:00.328 --> 01:21:02.762
My money's on Emma.

01:21:16.863 --> 01:21:18.896
I appreciate you showing
up when you did.

01:21:19.267 --> 01:21:20.499
You had him.

01:21:20.535 --> 01:21:22.386
Glad you thought so.

01:21:22.433 --> 01:21:23.999
Why'd you come out here?

01:21:24.050 --> 01:21:26.136
Oh, I brought you something

01:21:26.161 --> 01:21:27.861
I think you're going to want to see.

01:21:28.142 --> 01:21:29.408
There we go.

01:21:30.912 --> 01:21:34.213
- A present?
- Uh, not yet, but maybe someday.

01:21:34.248 --> 01:21:35.948
It's actually evidence.

01:21:35.983 --> 01:21:38.250
Can we go into your father's lab?

01:21:38.746 --> 01:21:40.178
Yeah.

01:21:44.899 --> 01:21:46.732
So, what's going to happen to Will?

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.406
Tampering with evidence.

01:21:48.531 --> 01:21:50.436
He'll need a good lawyer.

01:21:50.472 --> 01:21:51.971
Will he go back to jail?

01:21:52.006 --> 01:21:53.188
That's hard to tell.

01:21:53.547 --> 01:21:55.942
It would help if he had a
renowned archaeologist

01:21:55.977 --> 01:21:57.410
as a character witness,

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.052
if you happen to know one.

01:21:59.913 --> 01:22:01.179
Think I just might.

01:22:01.537 --> 01:22:02.882
I, uh...

01:22:02.917 --> 01:22:05.708
I found this at Tichnor's.

01:22:05.865 --> 01:22:08.036
- It's the pitcher I discovered!
- It's the pitcher I discovered...

01:22:08.075 --> 01:22:09.059
I discovered the pitcher.

01:22:09.084 --> 01:22:11.156
- I found the pitcher.
- No, you didn't even know what it was

01:22:11.181 --> 01:22:13.481
until I told you.

01:22:13.984 --> 01:22:15.951
I admit, Professor...

01:22:16.197 --> 01:22:17.230
We work well together.

01:22:18.491 --> 01:22:19.657
We do.

01:22:21.902 --> 01:22:23.835
I think we deserve a little fun.

01:22:26.530 --> 01:22:27.629
Okay.

01:22:27.654 --> 01:22:29.720
You may think this is fun,
but my back is not amused.

01:22:29.845 --> 01:22:32.679
Hey, less complaining, more sifting.

01:22:32.761 --> 01:22:36.596
You archaeologists, you
know, bust into tombs...

01:22:36.664 --> 01:22:38.697
Fight snakes and bad guys

01:22:38.722 --> 01:22:41.089
and make off with priceless objects.

01:22:41.114 --> 01:22:43.114
Yeah, we do... In the movies.

01:22:43.310 --> 01:22:44.476
[Chuckles]

01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:48.462
Connor!

01:22:48.552 --> 01:22:49.584
What?

01:22:49.635 --> 01:22:50.935
Look.

01:22:53.378 --> 01:22:54.644
What is that?

01:22:59.500 --> 01:23:01.367
It's a theodolite.

01:23:01.613 --> 01:23:03.813
It's a surveyor's instrument.

01:23:14.899 --> 01:23:15.865
Is this the proof

01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:18.034
that you and your father
were looking for? Did...

01:23:18.069 --> 01:23:19.201
Yeah!

01:23:19.237 --> 01:23:20.336
It is?

01:23:20.665 --> 01:23:22.989
- Yes!
- Congratulations!

01:23:25.274 --> 01:23:27.207
Well done, Emma...

01:23:27.232 --> 01:23:28.297
Emma Professor.
