02:11.000 --> 02:16.750
Welcome on board the train from
Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells.

02:16.833 --> 02:21.249
Train stops in London Bridge,
Orpington, Sevenoaks, Tonbridge

02:21.332 --> 02:25.793
High Brooms and Tunbridge Wells.
I'll be moving around through the train.

02:25.875 --> 02:29.957
Please have your
tickets ready for inspection.

03:11.704 --> 03:16.538
Where are we, Max?
Are we still in London?

03:16.621 --> 03:22.370
I think so. Can we just have one game?
Just one.

03:22.453 --> 03:25.953
- One game of what?
- Rock, paper, scissors.

03:26.037 --> 03:29.828
And then you have to promise 
to get some sleep.

03:29.911 --> 03:34.787
- Best of five.
- No. I'm not doing best of five. One game.

03:34.869 --> 03:37.494
Okay.

03:47.244 --> 03:52.702
Let me warm up my hands. Hands are
very important to "rock, paper, scissors".

03:52.786 --> 03:55.285
Ready and preying for action.

03:55.368 --> 03:58.285
Rock, paper, scissors!

03:59.743 --> 04:04.616
- Best of three.
- Rock, paper, scissors.

04:04.700 --> 04:12.326
- Hang on a minute you're cheating. Yes you are.
- You're guessing what I'm thinking, aren't you?
- You're reading my mind.
- But that's not cheating.

04:12.410 --> 04:16.949
Alright, best of five.
Ready?

04:18.491 --> 04:24.699
Someone's ringing.
No they're not.
Somebody is ringing.

04:29.824 --> 04:34.573
This is Shaler.
Sorry? Hang on a second.

04:34.657 --> 04:38.990
You lot mind keeping it down?
I'm on the phone!

04:39.073 --> 04:41.907
Thank you very much.

04:41.990 --> 04:49.323
Hang on a bit. Mouse, you just wait here. I'm going over there.
It's quieter. Harry can forage a bit, Okay?.

04:52.031 --> 04:55.614
Tell me you've got police restraining drunks -

04:55.697 --> 05:01.738
- teenagers in tears and nurses
doubling as bouncers.

05:02.697 --> 05:08.738
I'm on the train home from London. 
It's self-ventilating?

05:10.321 --> 05:16.071
Well no, I took my boy to see "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang".
Where is the registrar?

05:20.404 --> 05:25.278
- Who are you traveling with?
- My father. He's over there.

05:26.278 --> 05:29.528
Yah no, you cut out for a second.

05:29.611 --> 05:33.530
- What's his name?
- Harry.

05:35.570 --> 05:39.694
No, No don't do that. I'll be there. Just clear the
recess. Call the trauma team.

05:39.778 --> 05:43.110
Don't wait for the blood results...

05:43.193 --> 05:48.442
Don't wait for the blood results.
Just get me to the X-rays.

05:48.526 --> 05:53.777
I'll be there in ... 47 minutes.

05:53.860 --> 05:59.984
- You said Harry could forage for food.
- Here's a tissue... Oh my God.

06:00.067 --> 06:04.734
You're lucky I don't take Harry away right now.
- I'm so, sooo sorry.

06:04.817 --> 06:10.401
This is how my night's been going.
I take it this little charmer is yours.
Charmer... half right.

06:10.484 --> 06:14.567
- Did you say you're sorry, Max?
- I'm sorry.
- I accept. It's alright, I understand.

06:14.651 --> 06:19.024
Listen, can I...
pay for the cleaning?

06:19.107 --> 06:22.691
Buy me a new coat..
if it makes you feel better.

06:22.775 --> 06:27.025
I'm joking, really.
I'm fine.

06:27.108 --> 06:31.774
- I'm soo sorry.
- Oh, I'll survive.

06:31.856 --> 06:35.649
You, sit down, don't move.

06:44.148 --> 06:47.856
Max, that was the hospital that called.

06:47.939 --> 06:52.606
There's been a car crash monkey, and they
need me in tonight.

06:52.689 --> 06:57.398
I'm going to have to take you to stay
at grandma and grandpa's, okay?

06:59.022 --> 07:02.439
They'll have mince pies -

07:02.523 --> 07:07.146
- ice cream - chocolate cake.

07:07.229 --> 07:12.353
And lots and lots of whiskey.
I'm sorry monkey.

07:13.228 --> 07:20.688
How long now? Before you said you'd
be at the hospital in about 47 minutes.

07:20.772 --> 07:26.103
- Well, I was... just...
- How can you get away with being so vague?
- I mean what about the seconds?

07:26.186 --> 07:29.395
Are all doctors so meticulous or is it just you?

07:29.478 --> 07:35.520
Dad's a really good Doctor. He can tell 
what's wrong with people just by looking at them.

07:37.436 --> 07:43.561
- What about her?
- Pneumocranial disorder.

07:43.645 --> 07:47.519
"Pneumo" as in air,
"cranial" as in skull.

07:47.602 --> 07:51.768
- "Airhead". Nice save!
- Yah, the price is the same.

07:51.850 --> 07:58.644
- Would you like to see some of my pictures?
- Yes, I'd love to see your pictures! Thank you.

07:58.727 --> 08:02.184
Yes, I would. I love art!

08:02.268 --> 08:04.892
I warned you.

08:04.975 --> 08:09.142
This is one of my stories i've been doing -

08:09.225 --> 08:14.392
- and the pictures are falling out and everything.
I don't really know why.

08:14.475 --> 08:20.267
You'll be there all night.
And this is called "Treasure Island".
It's got a bit like my doodah.

08:20.350 --> 08:24.141
My, you're very talented! I wonder where
you get that from.

08:24.224 --> 08:30.516
Do you know you're going to be a famous artist one day?
Yah.
I think I'm going to frame my coat.

08:30.599 --> 08:37.181
- I think it's good meeting you tonight.
- You're going to make me a lot of money.
- This is some of my oil pastels.

08:37.265 --> 08:41.682
Oil Pastels!
Oh, excuse me gents.

08:48.390 --> 08:52.472
I'm safe. I'm on the train.

08:53.264 --> 08:59.430
No, no! I had a very... lovely evening.
I just only got tired, thats all.

09:00.681 --> 09:04.097
I'm not fibing.

09:04.180 --> 09:10.346
Thanks, you'll see that you're the pretty one. I'm
quite content to be your wingcheck.

09:10.429 --> 09:13.095
Foxy fox!

09:19.177 --> 09:23.596
Are you finished with this? Thank you.

09:58.385 --> 10:01.175
On Track for Gold and Glory

10:07.217 --> 10:10.883
Don't touch the door!
Harry's foraging.

10:10.966 --> 10:18.175
Well, Harry can forage on the seats.
Because those are marshlands and the doors are cliffs.

10:21.133 --> 10:24.634
Oh I know, I was a bore.

10:24.717 --> 10:27.424
Tickets please!

10:27.508 --> 10:32.424
- Excuse me sir, can you put it out now please?
- The bar is closed.

10:32.508 --> 10:38.340
That doesn't matter.
Can you put it out now?!
Look, there are signs everywhere inside the train.

10:38.423 --> 10:42.921
If you can not read
it means "no smoking".

10:43.005 --> 10:47.047
Open the fucking bar!
Open the fucking bar!

10:47.132 --> 10:50.507
You don't swear at me!

10:50.590 --> 10:58.338
- And if you don't put it now, I'll personally arrange for
  transport police to escort you off train.
- Thank you very much!

10:58.421 --> 11:04.504
- What are those?
- Excuse me sir leave it to me! 
- Camel Light.

11:04.587 --> 11:07.756
Really, I thought that was a student cigarette?
Come on now, put it out.

11:07.838 --> 11:13.130
We don't want the secondhand smoke.

11:13.213 --> 11:16.380
Take it from me.

11:54.502 --> 11:57.751
I will be in the bar!

11:57.833 --> 12:01.042
Talk to you tomorrow.

12:01.126 --> 12:04.417
I didn't buy ticket!

12:11.833 --> 12:16.501
Oh dear... young punk.
- Tickets, please!

12:18.166 --> 12:23.499
- What's his diagnosis?
- He's crazy.

12:24.207 --> 12:27.039
Max!

12:27.624 --> 12:35.166
What did I tell you? What did I just tell you? 
These doors are dangerous Max and you never touch them!

12:36.124 --> 12:40.624
Give me Harry.
I've had enough of him for one day.

12:40.707 --> 12:46.122
Just sit there and don't move!

13:03.538 --> 13:07.121
Those doors are dangerous, monkey.

13:07.204 --> 13:12.871
And if you fall out of them while the train is moving,
then you'll be killed.

13:12.954 --> 13:15.996
Do you understand me?
Look at me.

13:16.079 --> 13:20.870
- Do you understand?
- I'm sorry.

13:20.953 --> 13:24.245
You scared me.

13:35.203 --> 13:37.578
Tickets, please.
Thank you.

13:41.494 --> 13:45.077
I suggest your boy sits on the aisle side in future -

13:45.160 --> 13:48.827
- unless you plan on bringing your own child seat. 
- Thank you.

13:48.910 --> 13:54.369
- Madam, Ticket please!
- Pity no one thought about putting
- automatic locks on those doors.

13:54.452 --> 13:58.701
- Actually why bother with doors, why not use net curtains?
- Madam, are you his mother?

13:58.784 --> 14:04.701
- My mom died.
- Oh... I'm sorry to hear that.

14:04.783 --> 14:08.033
Tickets, please!

16:35.814 --> 16:38.981
She didn't say goodbye.

16:39.064 --> 16:41.898
Yup!

16:48.481 --> 16:51.813
Why don't you get some sleep.

16:58.147 --> 17:01.606
She was nice.
Aah.

17:57.267 --> 18:01.267
Still going to make it in 47 minutes?

18:01.351 --> 18:06.183
Give or take a few seconds.
I thought you got off.

18:06.266 --> 18:11.058
I went to get some water for the coat.
Aah.

18:12.101 --> 18:15.559
I think we're the last people on this train.

18:16.891 --> 18:19.683
Yep.

18:21.224 --> 18:26.975
- Where are you getting off?
- Tonbridge Wells. What about you?

18:27.058 --> 18:30.724
- Tonbridge.
- Last chance for some shuteye then.

18:30.807 --> 18:34.931
Not like you can nod off in work.
Not likely.

18:35.014 --> 18:39.806
- What do you do?
- Events management. I manage events.

18:39.889 --> 18:44.723
You do not want me to tell you how boring it is.
Okay.

18:44.806 --> 18:48.515
Don't tell me then.

18:52.598 --> 18:57.347
Your job is exciting.
You get to help people. You're making a difference.

18:57.430 --> 19:00.305
I'd get a lot from that.
Oh Sure.

19:00.388 --> 19:05.472
Grey hair and sleepless nights.
It's very rewarding.

19:08.888 --> 19:11.887
I abandoned my friends tonight.

19:11.971 --> 19:15.720
- Isn't that awful?
- Well, It depends on what they did.

19:15.803 --> 19:19.886
- They were trying to cheer me up.
- How dare they!

19:19.970 --> 19:25.220
No I... broke up with my boyfriend a month ago -

19:25.303 --> 19:29.345
- so they organized a night on the town in London.

19:29.428 --> 19:34.261
- Cocktailing, clubing, you know - the whole shebang.
- What a chore.

19:34.345 --> 19:40.010
You'd be surprised. I can't do it anymore.
Could  you?
Me?

19:40.094 --> 19:47.009
A single dad with a seven year old tender
and a chance to party all night? Hmm.

19:48.676 --> 19:52.469
- Why don't you change your seat?
- No. No, no.

19:52.552 --> 19:57.469
I'm warming my legs up. ER is
a war zone this time of year.

19:57.552 --> 20:00.843
- Warm up on me.
- Excuse me?

20:01.509 --> 20:05.258
Guess my condition.
Oh!

20:06.425 --> 20:09.550
Okay...

20:15.925 --> 20:21.382
- Heart murmur.
- Nice guess! That's talent.

20:21.466 --> 20:25.923
- Aah for a seven-year old it's entertainment.
- And how would you know this assessment?

20:26.007 --> 20:30.549
Well, first, I'd check your fifth intercostal space,
your middle auxiliary point.

20:30.632 --> 20:36.090
- Remind me where that is again?
- It's right here.

20:39.131 --> 20:43.380
So just under my left breast...

20:46.047 --> 20:51.797
And then.. I would feel for a palpable murmur
- or a thrill (vibration).

20:51.880 --> 20:58.754
- It's what we call it. A thrill.
- You'd feel me for a thrill ...

21:06.672 --> 21:10.753
Then... I would send you...

21:10.837 --> 21:14.795
... for an ECG examination.

21:28.169 --> 21:32.627
You know I don't think the stain is coming out.

21:32.710 --> 21:36.294
I'd like to take you up on your offer just now.

21:36.377 --> 21:41.169
Or you can buy me a new coat with your 
Doctor's salary.

21:41.252 --> 21:45.336
Shall I give you my number?

21:58.001 --> 22:04.250
Sarah... Barwell? You could a
doctor with handwriting like this.

22:04.334 --> 22:09.167
Funny,.. or rude. I can't work out what
sums you up best.

22:09.250 --> 22:14.417
- All my patients have that problem.
- And do any of your patients get to call you by your first name?

22:14.500 --> 22:18.000
Ooh... only special cases.

22:19.667 --> 22:22.791
Lewis.

22:24.208 --> 22:27.623
Well you get some rest, Lewis.

22:27.706 --> 22:31.498
I'll wake you before Tonbridge.

25:01.613 --> 25:03.695
Sarah...

25:03.778 --> 25:09.280
- Gosh, I'm so sorry! I just closed my eyes for a few seconds.
- Have we missed your stop? 
- No, no, no, no!

25:09.363 --> 25:13.238
- It's Max, do you mind keeping an eye on him for a minute?
- No, of course not.
- I'm just going to go and try and find the guard.

25:13.322 --> 25:18.321
- If he wakes up, can you just tell him...
- You've gone to find the guard.

25:18.404 --> 25:21.028
Yes.
There is nothing to worry about.

26:00.942 --> 26:03.649
Hello?

26:07.108 --> 26:11.526
- What do you think you're doing?
- Have you seen the guard?
- Are you looking for an earl grey?

26:11.609 --> 26:15.107
There is someone hurt outside. Might be on the tracks.
Maybe hit by the train.

26:15.192 --> 26:19.567
Well, there's a first. Someone throws themselve in front of the 
train and it's not delayed?

26:19.649 --> 26:24.066
- Have you seen the guard?
- And what can he do about it?

26:24.149 --> 26:28.107
He could give you a 50 pound fine
for pulling that I suppose.

26:28.191 --> 26:32.399
- It's an emergency.
- An emergency, where? Are we on fire?

26:32.482 --> 26:38.482
- There's a guy outside. I'm trying to let the driver know.
- What's he going to do back up and give mouth-to-mouth?

26:38.566 --> 26:43.814
Why not wait until we're outside this tunnel
and then call an ambulance.

26:45.814 --> 26:49.647
Well?
What are you waiting for?

26:57.230 --> 27:00.522
Hi! Ambulance please!

27:00.605 --> 27:06.770
Hi, I'm on a train. There's been an accident
on the Hastings line somewhere between...

27:06.853 --> 27:10.313
... Seven Oaks and Tonbridge.

27:10.396 --> 27:15.063
Well, there's someone outside on the tracks, 
badly hurt.

27:15.146 --> 27:18.270
I can't find the guard!

27:18.353 --> 27:24.270
Lewis Shaler, I'm an E&E consultant at
Tonbridge. I'm on my way there now.

27:25.437 --> 27:28.770
Yah no please do, because they're gonna have the 
blue light and then he's...

27:28.853 --> 27:32.937
- Okay, thanks, thank you.
- You're on your way to the emergency room?

27:33.020 --> 27:38.477
Traffic accident, the registrar is second best, their understaffed.

27:40.602 --> 27:48.226
- Where's your receptionist?
- Needless in a boozer beef, felt up under the mistletoe I imagine. Goodnight.

27:50.477 --> 27:55.060
Oh, can you do that one? Yeh!
This one... More...

27:56.060 --> 28:01.892
- I'll try.
- You do that very nice by the way.
- Normally people are wowed.

28:01.975 --> 28:06.641
- Nearly.
- I don't know how to do it.
- Can you do this one?

28:09.475 --> 28:13.641
Try it faster.
You are so sweet!

28:13.724 --> 28:19.016
- Dad, look at this!
- A just a little party trick.

28:20.224 --> 28:25.224
- What? Did you find the guard?
- Don't run, Max!

28:25.308 --> 28:29.932
You know I haven't heard nary a twit from you in
several minutes, and I'm getting concerned.

28:30.015 --> 28:33.932
Okay, I just saw someone outside on the tracks.
On the tracks? Doing what?

28:34.015 --> 28:37.306
Crawling! 
Crawling? Where?
Along the tracks.

28:37.390 --> 28:43.890
- I don't get it. Who is that?
- I don't know. Max, wait!

29:15.513 --> 29:20.095
- Sorry to bother you. Have you seen the guard?
- No.

29:20.179 --> 29:24.053
- Is there something wrong?
- No. Thanks anyway.

29:24.136 --> 29:26.011
Hello there!

29:26.094 --> 29:31.718
- How old are you?
- Max! Keep gloves on and your... hat.

29:37.220 --> 29:42.010
Okay. This... is ours.
Will you be okay?

29:42.094 --> 29:47.967
- I think so. But I better not leave that
heart murmur too long though.
- Heh.

29:49.302 --> 29:52.218
- Goodbye then.
- Goodbye.

29:52.302 --> 29:55.426
You have my number.

30:05.426 --> 30:10.592
- It's no use, you're going to have to work 
a lot harder for the next one.
- I don't believe it!

30:10.675 --> 30:16.715
- The train didn't stop! Dad, the train didn't stop!
- I know!

30:16.799 --> 30:22.382
23:10,
Charing Cross to Tunbridge Wells...

30:22.465 --> 30:26.090
Tonbridge.

30:26.924 --> 30:31.299
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna have a word with the driver.

30:31.382 --> 30:36.714
All the way to the front again? My knee hurts!
Your knee doesn't hurt!

30:36.798 --> 30:40.673
- He can stay here if he's tired.
- Oh we don't have first class tickets.

30:40.756 --> 30:44.881
Neither do I.
No guard to worry about, apparently.

30:44.964 --> 30:50.297
Oh well my knee hurts too. Isn't that funny! And I'm
armed to the teeth with party tricks. You can run along.

30:50.380 --> 30:55.380
- Dad never runs anywhere.
- Oh, they're gorgeous! Max, look!

30:55.463 --> 31:01.838
- Otter for Leah, penguin for Jake.
- My grandchildren.
- Sit down Max!

31:01.922 --> 31:07.172
- But, the seats are purple. Purple is for girls.
- Don't be daft, pink is for girls, not purple.

31:07.255 --> 31:11.795
- No, purple is for big strong men!
- Like Batman.
- Alright stand then. It's up to you.

31:11.878 --> 31:14.878
I'll uh... I'll be right back!

31:14.961 --> 31:19.836
Max, this isn't just any purple!

31:19.920 --> 31:26.171
This is Imperial Purple.
Don't you know where it comes from?

31:26.254 --> 31:28.753
A rare sea snail -

31:28.836 --> 31:34.461
- that clings to the rocky shores of the 
remote islands off the coast of Morocco.

31:34.545 --> 31:38.169
Africa.

31:38.252 --> 31:43.751
In ancient times it was worth more than its weight in gold -

31:43.834 --> 31:49.210
- because it was the color of Roman royalty.

31:49.294 --> 31:55.001
It was the color of immortality.

32:08.542 --> 32:16.000
You have to manage yourself for now.
And I'll get out when I get out.

32:16.083 --> 32:21.041
I don't know.
Listen, I'm stuck on a train. I can't do any better than that.

32:38.289 --> 32:40.580
Hello?

32:42.289 --> 32:48.248
Hello? Is the driver there?
I really need to speak to someone.

32:52.205 --> 32:57.954
- Is the driver there? This is one of your passengers.
- How many of you are left?

32:58.038 --> 33:04.038
- Is this the driver?
- Passengers. 
- What?
- How many passengers?

33:04.121 --> 33:08.455
There's... six of us!

33:08.539 --> 33:16.203
Now listen, some of us were to get off at Tonbridge,
and there was someone... tracks?

33:16.287 --> 33:18.328
Hello?

33:19.995 --> 33:22.744
Hello!

33:25.619 --> 33:30.202
And then there's this picture.
How nice.

33:30.286 --> 33:35.077
And he starts to sew the leg back on to him.

34:01.575 --> 34:06.699
I'm an E&E doctor and 
I have to get into the hospital!

34:07.616 --> 34:13.074
There's been a traffic accident! I'll call the police!
I'm already one step ahead of you on that!

34:13.159 --> 34:17.699
- He just went past my stop!
- You didn't find a guard then?

34:17.783 --> 34:20.947
No, all I found was his ticket machine.

34:27.739 --> 34:34.572
- And what, do you think that was him rolling around outside in the dirt?
- I don't know. But there's something up with the driver.
- I'd say he's just ignoring you. I would if I were him.

34:34.657 --> 34:42.989
- He just spoke with me. He asked me how many passengers were left.
- And when I told him about the guy outside he hung up.
- He actually spoke to you?

34:43.072 --> 34:48.780
There's an intercom in the guard's box.
And who said you could go in the guard's box?

34:48.862 --> 34:54.072
The guard leave those too did he? 
What?
Those keys.
What, these keys?

34:54.156 --> 34:58.946
Tell you what why don't I call the police right now and
tell them what you're up to?
Okay. Good thinking!

35:00.488 --> 35:03.488
This isn't funny!

35:05.695 --> 35:09.237
Oh, my God!

35:13.654 --> 35:16.736
Don't!

35:23.487 --> 35:26.195
That's my stop!

35:39.652 --> 35:42.110
Heh! What are you doing?

35:47.235 --> 35:50.067
What is it?

35:50.151 --> 35:56.359
Take your pick. Stuck needle or no pressure in the brakes.

35:56.442 --> 35:58.859
Oh my God!

35:58.942 --> 36:02.067
Step over. After you.

36:15.484 --> 36:18.234
Don't these stop the train?
In theory!

36:18.317 --> 36:23.565
- Everyone knows pulling the communication
post stops the train. Everyone!
- Everyone is wrong!

36:23.649 --> 36:27.399
No way to disable the brakes from the outside?
No, not while the train's moving.

36:27.482 --> 36:30.898
Earlier when the train stopped, I saw someone out there.
Yes, Yes you keep saying that.

36:30.981 --> 36:35.439
Not the guy that was hurt, not him. Before that. Just before that.
Where?
Somebody was hurt?

36:35.523 --> 36:40.024
Outside. He was doing something to the train. I
thought he was a railroad worker. But he was...

36:40.107 --> 36:44.481
There was a hissing sound like...
...like air coming out of the brakes.

36:44.563 --> 36:49.647
- What did he look like?
- He was wearing a high-vis jacket.

36:51.063 --> 36:54.522
I don't know, it was dark.

36:56.021 --> 37:00.937
- What?
- What have you got on there?

37:01.021 --> 37:05.355
- Do you like?
- It's very fetching. Do you work for the railway?

37:05.438 --> 37:08.313
No, London Underground.

37:08.397 --> 37:11.354
Cleaner.

37:11.437 --> 37:15.603
- Have you seen the guard recently?
- No. Have you?

37:15.686 --> 37:21.311
- What's your name?
- Who are you? Police?
- What is your name?

37:21.395 --> 37:27.436
- Peter Carmichael, and this is Dr. Lewis Shaler.

37:30.061 --> 37:34.560
Jan... Klimowski.

37:34.644 --> 37:38.809
- And I have not been outside.
- I'm sorry, whose accusing you of anything?

37:38.893 --> 37:43.353
You! You know who I think let air from brakes?

37:43.436 --> 37:48.226
- The same person now driving this train.

37:51.101 --> 37:53.683
Oh, god...

37:54.933 --> 37:58.017
What can we do...

38:03.559 --> 38:05.476
Transport Police!

38:05.558 --> 38:09.682
- Where's Max?
- He's fine. He's crashing with Elaine.

38:09.766 --> 38:14.099
- Well, what's going on?
- I thought this was supposed to be a stopping service.
- So did I.

38:14.182 --> 38:20.224
- Well, why don't we just pull the brake chain?
- We did. We tried. We pulled the emergency brake, and the guard 
lever, and all the chains on the way here.

38:20.307 --> 38:25.641
- Dude! shall I pull it? 
- Go ahead!
- I will you know!
- They don't work.

38:28.556 --> 38:32.265
This is the train to and from Tunbridge Wells.

38:32.348 --> 38:36.098
So the rear driving cab should
be the same as the front one.

38:36.181 --> 38:40.014
- Please tell me there's a brake in there.
- Let's hope so.

38:46.930 --> 38:50.639
- He's not tired your boy?
- No. He's not my boy.

38:50.722 --> 38:56.721
- You're not married?
- Not yet. We just met.
- You just met tonight on this train?

38:56.804 --> 39:01.637
- Uh huh.
- And he leaves his boy with you?
- I'm not as dangerous as I look.

39:01.720 --> 39:07.263
- Why do you come to back of train? Why don't you go to driver's door?
- I already tried that, it's jammed.

39:07.346 --> 39:11.845
- Leave that door alone!
- You speak to police?

39:11.928 --> 39:14.721
They're contacting the driver direct -

39:14.804 --> 39:20.428
- and they warned all of us not to do anything to 
jeopardize their efforts to stop this train.

39:25.053 --> 39:27.512
It was open!

39:27.595 --> 39:33.344
- I can't see anything, do you have a lighter?
- So we're ignoring the police then are we?
- Yes, fuck the police!

39:33.427 --> 39:36.760
- That's Tunbridge Wells, that's my stop! The last stop.
- No police! 

39:36.843 --> 39:40.968
Give them a chance, I only just told them!

39:41.926 --> 39:46.052
We'll be all the way to Hastings as long as
there ass isn't in gear.

39:46.136 --> 39:50.135
- Okay, so where's the brake?
- Well, that's not it.

39:50.219 --> 39:57.425
No, that one tells the driver that we're back here!
What about this one?
That's the dead man's handle...

39:57.508 --> 39:59.966
...ie touch it and your a dead man!
Hey boys, everyone gets a go, alright.

40:00.049 --> 40:03.966
Lewis, the keys.
Yes keys. Try the keys.

40:04.049 --> 40:07.426
These are just door keys. 
That's because the driver has the driver's keys.

40:07.509 --> 40:13.966
- And if you won't listen to the police then all they need to do is
cut the power to the third rail and we roll safely to a stop.
- No, we won't!

40:14.049 --> 40:20.216
- It's not the end of New Hebrides Lewis.
- This is an electrified line down here.
- It's a diesel train. Look!

40:20.299 --> 40:24.798
- So they can't cut the power?
- Well they can, but it won't stop us.

40:24.882 --> 40:29.090
- So how can they stop us?
- I don't think they can.

40:29.173 --> 40:32.589
We'd like to get off the train now!
We'd like to get off now!

40:32.672 --> 40:36.007
Lewis!
Lewis, put light here!

40:36.964 --> 40:43.006
- This is the back door.
- If we can open it, we can jump.
- And hopefully have a heart attack before we hit the ballast at 70 mph.

40:43.089 --> 40:47.464
- We can run off the back!
- You can run off the back. A little boy? Elaine?

40:47.546 --> 40:53.171
What other choice do we have?
Then you fill out a donor card before you jump off the train.
Okay! You stay and I'll jump!

40:53.255 --> 40:56.921
Boys! Boys!
Trains don't have steering wheels.

40:57.005 --> 41:01.671
"It's a handbrake.
Use only when the train is stationary."

41:01.755 --> 41:06.962
Do you really think that a handbrake will stop a speeding train?
I don't know what will stop this train.

41:07.045 --> 41:11.212
When we're off this thing I'll gladly tell the police that
you were against us coming in here, but it's a diesel train.

41:11.295 --> 41:14.670
And I don't see how they can stop it from the outside.
Yes, let him try!

41:14.754 --> 41:18.628
- Don't shine that in my face!
- Don't touch me!

41:27.752 --> 41:30.086
Come on!

41:39.752 --> 41:42.917
What was that?

41:46.666 --> 41:49.417
Come on!

41:54.168 --> 41:59.667
- It's working!
- It's working!
- It's working!

42:14.458 --> 42:18.165
He's fighting us!
But we fight back!

42:18.249 --> 42:21.749
It only makes it worse.

42:21.832 --> 42:27.790
- How fast? How fast now?
- 80 .. 85 ..

42:27.874 --> 42:30.581
90 ..

42:32.373 --> 42:37.039
- 95 ..
- The motor is too powerful.

42:37.123 --> 42:40.331
- 100
- Alright, this is dangerous and illegal!

42:40.414 --> 42:47.373
- Get off! Get off the cowl!
- Release the brake!
- Stop! Stop, boys please!

42:49.248 --> 42:53.663
- Is that all you've got?
- Alright! Alright! Take it easy!

42:53.747 --> 42:58.955
Help me! Help me! It's burning!
The smoke!
Help me to unwind it!

42:59.038 --> 43:04.413
No wonder the Soviets want you
our ignorant Jan!

43:18.037 --> 43:22.078
So the police said do nothing?
How can they do, they'll contact us if they need us.

43:22.161 --> 43:26.203
Breathe through that nostril.
And that one.

43:26.286 --> 43:29.244
You're fine. Just stay standing and
keep pinching it just... by the bridge.

43:29.327 --> 43:32.784
- Have they spoken to the driver?
- They're working on it.

43:32.868 --> 43:38.535
But you heard his voice so we know he's conscious,
the question is why is he doing this?

43:38.619 --> 43:44.701
When he spoke to me he asked me
how many passengers were left.

43:44.784 --> 43:49.617
We should break his door and smash his face.
Then he will tell us.

43:49.700 --> 43:52.533
Yeh, we'll need a battering ram to get through, 
perhaps we can try your head.

43:52.617 --> 43:57.533
In the absence of a battering ram we'll just have to wait for the boys in blue.
Where are we now?

43:57.617 --> 44:00.700
I think we're approaching Stonegate.

44:00.783 --> 44:06.200
There is a level crossing after Stonegate.

44:06.700 --> 44:12.408
- Buy us some time won't they.
- Only if they're expecting us.

44:12.491 --> 44:16.199
- I suppose automatic, right?
- Some are, some aren't.

44:16.282 --> 44:21.991
If it's manual, then there's a red light and it's
up to the driver to stop the train.
- If the brakes are even working!

44:22.074 --> 44:26.698
- If we hit car we come off track.
- Very funny, Jan.

44:26.781 --> 44:31.032
- At 100 miles an hour!
- We should call the police to make sure they're ready for us.

44:31.116 --> 44:36.905
- How far from Stonegate is that level crossing?
- There's a tunnel before the station.

44:36.989 --> 44:43.781
- The crossing is a couple miles after that.
- So what's that 100 mph, that's 80 seconds.
- For God's sake.

44:45.031 --> 44:49.613
Hi, monkey!
Have you beat my high score yet?

44:49.696 --> 44:52.738
Keep trying.
The snake goes too fast!

44:52.821 --> 44:55.653
Yes, hello! The police.

44:56.363 --> 45:02.405
- Why was that man calling the police?
- Because there's something broken on the 
train and the driver needs to fix it.

45:02.489 --> 45:09.363
- If it's broken, how does it keep going?
- Because it's only the brakes that are broken, Max.
- Is that why we didn't stop?

45:09.446 --> 45:13.445
The driver is going to fix it, Max.
It's just like when I fixed your bike brakes. Remember that?

45:13.527 --> 45:18.445
But, how can he fix the brakes if the train can't stop?

45:18.527 --> 45:22.112
Do you want me to show you how to win snake or not?

45:23.903 --> 45:26.653
Come this side Max. Come, come, come!

45:26.737 --> 45:31.777
- You don't have to move forward!
- Sit this side, Max!
- Heh Max, this side is better.

45:31.861 --> 45:34.818
What have I told you? You do what you're told!

45:44.110 --> 45:49.193
Do you know, we pulled the communication cord
and nothing happened!

45:56.026 --> 45:58.984
Listen. Listen to me!

45:59.067 --> 46:02.108
I'm trying to tell you we're almost approaching Stonegate -

46:02.193 --> 46:08.524
- and if those barriers aren't down, then you are going to 
need counseling when you sift through the mess!

46:15.941 --> 46:19.149
Hey! Hey! Close the crossway! Heeey!

46:30.233 --> 46:35.315
Don't worry, Dad.
They'll fix the brakes.

46:36.772 --> 46:41.230
You're right monkey. It's crazy to worry.
Here take Harry.

46:52.981 --> 46:56.729
Let's...

46:56.813 --> 47:01.395
Let's play a game.
Let's play put your feet and knees firmly together on the floor.

47:01.478 --> 47:04.854
How bout "Simon Says".

47:06.396 --> 47:09.480
Simon says:
Put your feet and knees together like this.

47:09.563 --> 47:14.979
- A little bit further back.
- You didn't say "Simon says".

47:18.644 --> 47:24.978
Simon says: Bend down as far as you can
and put your hands behind your head.

47:27.478 --> 47:30.768
We're all going to sit like this for a bit.

47:34.853 --> 47:40.852
- And uh... close your eyes.
- Simon says: Close your eyes.

48:32.350 --> 48:34.974
Dad?

48:45.263 --> 48:48.179
Oh my God!

48:48.262 --> 48:52.222
- Did you get the police? Yes,
- but they were too late to do anything.

48:52.306 --> 48:55.348
Let me think for a minute.

48:56.972 --> 48:59.762
Elaine, are you alright?

48:59.846 --> 49:03.096
What?
What did she say?

49:03.179 --> 49:07.179
She said that the otter is for
Jake and the penguin for Leah.
Ooh, Ooh Elaine.

49:07.262 --> 49:11.554
Are you alright? Are you with me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Elaine? Elaine!

49:11.637 --> 49:14.845
Ok, give me a hand to get her down.

49:22.136 --> 49:26.886
She's in cardiac arrest. Check her handbag for pills!

49:44.843 --> 49:48.219
There is no pills!
There is no pills, Lewis.

49:50.009 --> 49:55.301
- Lewis what can we do?
- Does anyone else know how to do CPR?

49:55.384 --> 50:00.717
- Sarah?
- No, I'm sorry I don't... I don't know how to...

50:04.758 --> 50:09.257
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven-

50:09.341 --> 50:13.506
- eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve, thirteen...

50:13.591 --> 50:16.092
Come on, Elaine!

50:24.798 --> 50:27.673
Come on!

50:35.923 --> 50:39.091
Come on!

51:03.962 --> 51:07.670
Nearly ten minutes, Lewis!

51:11.004 --> 51:15.295
- How long are you going to do this?
- Let him do it!

51:15.378 --> 51:20.419
I am going to go to front to break driver's door.
I need your help!

51:20.502 --> 51:23.252
She needs his help!
She's dead!

51:34.127 --> 51:36.960
"Home".

51:39.252 --> 51:42.418
Give it to me.

51:45.418 --> 51:50.335
- How long til end of line?
- At this speed if we don't run into anything maybe half an hour.

51:50.417 --> 51:54.749
- Maybe half an hour. Maybe.
- We can't just leave her.

51:54.833 --> 51:59.917
- What about us!
- Lewis, what about your boy!

52:00.000 --> 52:04.625
Lewis, does she have any chance?

52:04.709 --> 52:09.416
- If I had a defib.
- But you don't.

52:13.333 --> 52:18.456
Come on!
We have no time!

52:43.539 --> 52:48.663
- You couldn't save her Dad?
- No Max, I couldn't.

52:48.746 --> 52:54.121
If you were at the hospital 
you would have.

53:27.203 --> 53:30.203
Knock, knock.
Bang bang bang bang

53:43.743 --> 53:47.286
Okay Lewis my turn. Come on!

53:55.408 --> 53:58.326
Okay Lewis let me! Let me.

53:58.408 --> 54:00.657
Let me!

54:00.740 --> 54:05.783
Thank you.
- Ladies and gentlemen...

54:05.867 --> 54:10.616
Welcome on board train
to Tunbridge Wells!

54:10.700 --> 54:18.115
Tonight we stop to let some passengers 
off. Some passengers we do not let off!

54:18.199 --> 54:21.324
They must stop train themselves!

54:27.032 --> 54:30.698
Open that door!

54:30.781 --> 54:36.031
Okay, give me a couple of seconds,
I will try again.

54:51.780 --> 54:55.529
Trump!
Again! Again!

54:57.029 --> 55:00.403
Again! Again!

55:21.860 --> 55:25.152
- Wait! Wait!
- What?

55:25.235 --> 55:28.194
Nothing.

55:29.236 --> 55:34.652
- Jan this was your idea. It was your idea!
- Okay.

55:35.360 --> 55:38.610
Can you help me?

55:49.193 --> 55:52.734
- Are you okay?
- Yah.

55:52.818 --> 55:56.109
- I'm okay.
- Piss.

55:56.193 --> 55:58.442
Fuck!

56:00.276 --> 56:03.899
Give me the lamp.

56:05.607 --> 56:09.399
I found the guard.

56:31.065 --> 56:33.565
Open the door!

56:40.604 --> 56:44.105
Open the door!

56:44.189 --> 56:47.064
Listen...

56:47.148 --> 56:50.771
Hey look.

56:50.854 --> 56:55.604
Whatever it is you're doing, just
stop the train-

56:55.688 --> 56:59.313
- and let us off!

56:59.395 --> 57:01.896
I'm begging you.
I'm begging you.

57:01.979 --> 57:07.103
My son... is on the train.

57:07.187 --> 57:11.352
My son. He...

57:17.729 --> 57:21.228
I'm coming in!

57:23.062 --> 57:26.102
I'm serious, I'm coming in!

57:27.102 --> 57:30.143
Oh, my God!

57:31.643 --> 57:36.811
- I'm serious!
- Horn exploding!

57:36.894 --> 57:40.061
I'm serious!

57:40.144 --> 57:44.311
Open the door, you bastard!

57:45.475 --> 57:50.474
- Lewis!
- Open the door!

57:53.268 --> 57:56.935
Fuck!

57:58.517 --> 58:02.933
- I need your pole.
- You're bleeding.
- I need the pole.

58:15.308 --> 58:18.058
Fuck!

58:26.307 --> 58:29.514
You bastard!

58:29.597 --> 58:35.015
Why are you doing this?
Why are you fucking...

58:42.471 --> 58:47.555
- Lewis...
- He's right there.

58:47.638 --> 58:52.888
- I know.
- He's right there.

58:52.971 --> 58:55.762
I know.

58:55.845 --> 58:59.680
Jan... What are we going to do?

59:01.221 --> 59:03.971
What do we do?
What do we do?

59:04.055 --> 59:09.887
First we think. We do stupid 
things when we don't think.

59:09.970 --> 59:12.719
Then ...

59:14.594 --> 59:21.095
... we try something else.
Come on. You're a crazy fucker!

59:25.304 --> 59:30.635
Course it's not the Black Forest down here but I did manage to glean 
a few things before losing them.

59:30.718 --> 59:36.759
They're working on something a bit further down the line. 
And they found the driver.

59:36.842 --> 59:40.968
- Where?
- Just as you said Lewis, on the track.

59:41.053 --> 59:44.467
He said he been attacked by somebody on the train.

59:44.551 --> 59:49.591
- I think I saw him earlier.
- You saw him?
- Yah.

59:49.675 --> 59:53.425
I recognized his motorcycle helmet.

59:53.508 --> 59:58.716
He nearly got off at London Bridge,
as if he missed his stop.

59:58.801 --> 01:00:02.884
I think this guy kills the guard -

01:00:02.967 --> 01:00:07.258
- He drags him in there -

01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:14.465
- and then... he pulls the emergency brake,
which still works.

01:00:14.549 --> 01:00:20.007
And then he lets the air out of the brakes, jumps
into the driver's cab -

01:00:20.090 --> 01:00:25.299
- and throws him out...
I heard him shout. And...

01:00:28.381 --> 01:00:32.049
Do any of you remember Moorgate?

01:00:32.132 --> 01:00:37.963
Nah you're too young.
It was about 30 years ago.

01:00:38.047 --> 01:00:44.048
A crash on the underground.
Northern Line.

01:00:44.131 --> 01:00:51.505
When the train came into the station instead of 
slowing down it accelerated into the buffers.

01:00:51.588 --> 01:00:56.421
The driver was killed along with 40 other souls.

01:00:56.504 --> 01:01:04.296
They never proved what caused it, but speculation at
the time was that it was suicide.

01:01:06.921 --> 01:01:11.129
Driver suicide.

01:01:23.377 --> 01:01:25.461
INSTRUCTIONS

01:01:39.334 --> 01:01:43.044
- How long from end of line?
- About 20 minutes.

01:01:43.127 --> 01:01:47.127
- What is there after that?
- The great blue yonder.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:52.792
We could start fire outside door.
Smoke bring him out like in back.

01:01:52.875 --> 01:01:55.833
- Diesel tanks are under there.
- Even better we blow up the bastard!

01:01:55.917 --> 01:02:00.875
- At this speed we'd derail.
- So what do we do? We sit here? We do nothing?

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:05.167
Jan, just listen to me please. Now I don't know if you 
heard of the Paddington crash -

01:02:05.250 --> 01:02:09.292
- but there diesel tanks rupture, and when sparks ignited 
the diesel a fireball swept through the length of the train.

01:02:09.374 --> 01:02:13.624
When it reached the passengers they all
screamed. Do you know how they know that?

01:02:13.707 --> 01:02:21.748
- Because the insides of their mouths were burned out.
- Thank you very much, Mr. train crash.

01:02:21.831 --> 01:02:25.081
Look! "Buckeye coupler".
"Buckeye coupler".

01:02:25.165 --> 01:02:29.623
It holds the carriages together.
If we could get to it. We could... I don't know, we could unhitch it?

01:02:29.706 --> 01:02:35.373
- I know this. You pull here.
- You pull it?

01:02:35.456 --> 01:02:38.372
When you push lever this comes out.

01:02:38.455 --> 01:02:43.997
How you say...
knuckles.

01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:47.829
- Knuckles.
- Knuckles comes loose.

01:02:47.913 --> 01:02:52.122
This makes connection not safe.
Then it just needs shake...

01:02:52.205 --> 01:02:55.747
What, just like that, with all this load on the coupling?
This train weighing hundreds of tons.

01:02:55.830 --> 01:02:59.788
Load is on coupling, not on pin. Without pin it's
not safe.

01:02:59.871 --> 01:03:05.453
At this speed, train shaking, it will come open!

01:03:06.536 --> 01:03:11.328
I am graduate of engineering from
University of Technology, Gdansk.

01:03:11.412 --> 01:03:15.452
So we uncouple the carriages,
put the rear handbrake on and -

01:03:15.536 --> 01:03:18.536
- with luck roll to a gentle stop.

01:03:18.619 --> 01:03:22.037
Not bad, where is this coupling?

01:03:39.575 --> 01:03:42.867
Just under here.

01:03:45.575 --> 01:03:48.743
Well there's no getting thru there.
I will get to it.

01:03:48.826 --> 01:03:54.617
- Not without a sledgehammer you won't.
- I will go outside.

01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.616
- What do you mean you'll go outside?
- My English not good?

01:03:58.699 --> 01:04:02.825
- I said I will go outside!
- Jan, we're not on a cruise ship.

01:04:02.909 --> 01:04:07.824
You can't just go out on the deck.
How will you get out?

01:04:07.908 --> 01:04:12.657
- Same way I got in, through door!
- Of course, through the door how silly of me!

01:04:12.741 --> 01:04:17.407
- And what are you going to do then? Just float around outside?
- There is small step!

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:21.407
- It is only 2 inches wide.
- As much as that?

01:04:21.490 --> 01:04:23.657
Oh, I'm sorry. Is it too easy for you?

01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:31.114
Should we give you a blindfold, put ferrets in your pants
and tye one hand behind your back?

01:04:31.197 --> 01:04:36.948
Once you're out there in pitch black, freezing cold, moving 
at 100 miles per hour with nothing to hang on to...

01:04:37.032 --> 01:04:42.198
- How do you propose unhitching the coupling?
- Have any better idea?

01:04:42.281 --> 01:04:45.072
Tell me! Tell me!

01:04:49.655 --> 01:04:53.029
- Just hang on.
- You're going to keep talking?

01:04:53.112 --> 01:04:56.821
Just shut up and listen to me!

01:04:56.905 --> 01:05:03.487
Once we get past Crowhurst all these
trains go slower.
How do you know trains slow down?

01:05:03.570 --> 01:05:07.570
Because I take the line alone to get
to the coast to visit my son.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:13.403
You can learn very well from him.
He doesn't like me either.

01:05:13.486 --> 01:05:17.445
Okay, why trains slow down?
Because after Crowhurst the line becomes very poor 
all the way to Hastings.

01:05:17.529 --> 01:05:23.028
So if you're crazy enough to go outside,
that's the time to do it.

01:05:23.111 --> 01:05:28.484
This driver will not slow down.
Then he'll derail us if he doesn't.
You said he wants to die.

01:05:28.567 --> 01:05:34.236
Of course he does, but what's the point of dying out here! 
It's nothing near as dramatic as hitting those buffers in Hastings.

01:05:34.318 --> 01:05:39.860
Whoever this guy is, he's got it all planned,
and he wants to go out with a bang.

01:05:39.943 --> 01:05:46.652
And this, this is going to put him on the front 
page of every single newspaper in the land.

01:05:50.234 --> 01:05:54.816
I think we've got about five minutes before we get to Crowhurst.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:59.359
Why don't I buy you a drink.

01:06:03.025 --> 01:06:05.234
Thanks you.

01:06:17.481 --> 01:06:24.356
- What are you thinking Jan?
- I'm thinking how they will write this in newspaper.

01:06:27.274 --> 01:06:33.605
- Have you ever been in newspaper?
- Yah, but only local. It doesn't really count.

01:06:33.689 --> 01:06:39.190
- For what?
- The Olympics.
- Heh, the Olympics.

01:06:39.273 --> 01:06:43.438
Yah. I won a couple of races
for my university running club.

01:06:43.522 --> 01:06:48.271
- You said he never runs anywhere.
- He's just old. Huh.

01:06:48.354 --> 01:06:54.354
He got bad knees.
He damaged his cruciate ligaments.

01:06:54.437 --> 01:06:58.854
It was fun to run, but a doctor was 
always the end plan.

01:06:58.937 --> 01:07:04.147
- I followed in my parents' footsteps you know.
- How lucky your parents were!

01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:09.187
My son would never follow in my footsteps
if I were leading him out of a burning building.

01:07:09.270 --> 01:07:13.602
He thinks I'm a dying breed.

01:07:13.685 --> 01:07:18.270
Given the circumstances he could be right.

01:07:18.353 --> 01:07:22.936
What about you Jan?
Have you ever been in the paper?

01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:28.685
Back home, after I study Engineering,
I was magician.

01:07:30.309 --> 01:07:34.977
My parents still think I am magician.

01:07:35.060 --> 01:07:38.851
- Here in London?
- Yeh, successful and famous.

01:07:38.934 --> 01:07:42.476
Is that what you told them?

01:07:43.684 --> 01:07:47.476
So what's gonna happen when they find out?

01:07:47.559 --> 01:07:50.768
I find out tomorrow, when they fly here.

01:07:50.851 --> 01:07:58.183
Surprise Christmas trip. They're coming 
to see me in my big London show.

01:07:58.266 --> 01:08:04.557
They cannot wait to see 
their successful son.

01:08:04.641 --> 01:08:09.682
They're so proud there are 
articles about me in the newspapers.

01:08:09.766 --> 01:08:16.265
Especially my father. Because when I tell him I
want to be magician -

01:08:16.348 --> 01:08:20.140
- he was not happy.

01:08:20.223 --> 01:08:23.471
What are you going to tell him?

01:08:29.305 --> 01:08:33.805
Don't worry monkey, it's alright. It's alright.
He's trying to fix the brakes again.

01:08:33.889 --> 01:08:38.889
- Why don't you show us a magic trick?
- Of course.

01:08:38.971 --> 01:08:43.639
Okay. Max, you know smoking...

01:08:45.596 --> 01:08:48.139
... is very bad.

01:08:48.223 --> 01:08:52.804
Some people even say that it will kill you.

01:08:53.763 --> 01:09:00.761
But you know the funny thing about people is that they
keep doing things that is not good for them.

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:07.763
And if people keep doing things that is 
not good for them, maybe one day...

01:09:08.970 --> 01:09:11.386
... they become ...

01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:13.803
... Extinct.

01:09:13.886 --> 01:09:19.011
Where is cigarette? Do you have cigarette?
Not in briefcase?

01:09:19.095 --> 01:09:24.051
Mr Carmichael you have cigarette!
- What about Sarah? You look so innocent.

01:09:24.136 --> 01:09:28.886
Do you have cigarette?
- Max, you have cigarette?

01:09:28.969 --> 01:09:33.760
Do you have cigarette here?
What is this?

01:09:33.843 --> 01:09:39.593
It looks like ...
Harry has cigarette.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:45.966
Maybe that is why, Harry has 
become extinct.

01:09:49.425 --> 01:09:52.466
And sleep! And sleep!

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:57.925
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you -

01:09:58.009 --> 01:10:02.383
- the Great Klimowski.

01:10:09.842 --> 01:10:13.924
I'd keep moving, because the windchill 
is really going to bite.

01:10:14.008 --> 01:10:17.548
Don't move unless you have to.

01:10:17.632 --> 01:10:21.756
- And always keep three points of contact.
- You're worse than my mother.

01:10:21.839 --> 01:10:24.506
Come on, Max.
What's happening?

01:10:24.589 --> 01:10:29.966
- Where will you be?
- I'm going to be on that side. 
- Are you ready for this?

01:10:30.049 --> 01:10:37.255
Like Houdini...
I always do my own stunts.

01:11:07.503 --> 01:11:11.210
Monkey, go and sit with Sarah!
Go on! Sit with Sarah monkey!

01:11:11.293 --> 01:11:14.336
Simon says.

01:11:16.170 --> 01:11:19.378
Good luck!

01:11:55.376 --> 01:11:58.126
Jan!

01:11:58.208 --> 01:12:02.290
Jan! Are you okay?

01:12:20.332 --> 01:12:23.165
Fuck!

01:12:32.455 --> 01:12:35.039
Fuck!

01:12:36.165 --> 01:12:39.581
- Lewis!
- Jan!

01:12:39.664 --> 01:12:44.997
- Jan! Are you okay?
- No!

01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.913
I'm not okay!

01:12:51.829 --> 01:12:55.411
Hang on!

01:12:55.495 --> 01:13:00.162
- Jan! Give me your hand!
- I can't!

01:13:00.245 --> 01:13:04.162
Give it to me. Reach out. Just reach for my hand.
Take my hand!

01:13:04.245 --> 01:13:10.328
- I can't!
- Give me your hand! 
- I can't!
- Reach out!

01:13:10.786 --> 01:13:14.120
Okay I've got you!
I've got you!

01:13:21.827 --> 01:13:26.452
Lewis! See!

01:13:28.577 --> 01:13:32.451
A tunnel!
There's a tunnel ahead!

01:13:35.826 --> 01:13:38.200
Come on Jan! Come on!
Hurry up! Come on!

01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:43.784
We're nearly there!

01:13:47.742 --> 01:13:51.950
- Come on!
- Lewis!

01:14:01.367 --> 01:14:04.658
Worry.

01:14:09.824 --> 01:14:12.448
Jan?

01:14:13.198 --> 01:14:16.240
Jan!

01:14:18.031 --> 01:14:21.491
Jan? Can you hear me?

01:14:21.574 --> 01:14:24.490
Jan!

01:14:24.573 --> 01:14:27.448
Can you hear me?

01:14:27.531 --> 01:14:30.156
Jan!

01:14:43.571 --> 01:14:47.321
Let's get you up. Come on.

01:14:58.487 --> 01:15:01.528
Is that okay?

01:15:03.903 --> 01:15:10.028
It's Okay... You just sprained it Jan.
Keep your arm in there and don't move it.
Fucking hell!

01:15:10.112 --> 01:15:13.695
You're gonna be fine.

01:15:27.153 --> 01:15:30.777
Those things will kill you.

01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:39.234
Oh for God's sake!

01:15:39.317 --> 01:15:44.652
We can't let you quit, can we.
State would miss the charges.

01:15:48.234 --> 01:15:51.692
Cement.
It's probably their idea of a barricade.

01:15:51.775 --> 01:15:57.316
- I wish they had used sandbags.
- It's probably all the army had.

01:15:58.565 --> 01:16:03.941
Hang on ...
They may have thought this through.

01:16:06.150 --> 01:16:09.441
He's stopped?

01:16:24.439 --> 01:16:28.356
Forget it, it's a simple track tunnel.

01:16:35.565 --> 01:16:39.439
Max! Max, come here.

01:16:40.438 --> 01:16:43.271
Come here! Come here!

01:16:43.771 --> 01:16:47.188
I want you to climb down.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:52.520
I know it looks scary, but you have to go, 
because the train's not safe!

01:16:54.438 --> 01:16:58.021
Why can't I stay with you?

01:16:58.105 --> 01:17:02.812
Because I just told you, the train isn't safe.

01:17:08.269 --> 01:17:11.395
I don't want to.

01:17:11.479 --> 01:17:16.811
Don't start! What have I told you?
What have I told you? You do as you're told.

01:17:18.811 --> 01:17:21.185
Come on Max.

01:17:23.018 --> 01:17:24.685
Max!

01:17:24.768 --> 01:17:26.602
Lewis!

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.477
Max!

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:32.310
It's alright! It's alright!

01:17:32.393 --> 01:17:35.518
He is terrified.

01:17:35.602 --> 01:17:40.851
- It's safer off the train. 
- No Dad, No!
- I beg of you! I want to stay with you! 

01:17:40.934 --> 01:17:46.433
Take Harry away!
I'm sorry that I was playing with the door!

01:17:46.517 --> 01:17:50.477
I won't do it again! Please Daddy.
Lewis, stop!

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:55.059
- Think what you're doing!
- I know what I'm doing!

01:17:55.142 --> 01:17:58.641
I need you to get off the train. Come on.

01:17:58.725 --> 01:18:01.766
Listen to your Dad, please.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:07.265
- I know it's hard.
- No, Daddy! No!

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:11.557
- Lewis! Stop!
- I'm trying to help him!

01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:15.473
Okay, fine.
Never mind.

01:19:15.887 --> 01:19:21.095
That's West St. Leonards! Lewis!
We have ten minutes.

01:19:21.177 --> 01:19:28.052
We will die on this fucking train!
You think it's a good time to sit down now Lewis?

01:19:28.134 --> 01:19:31.551
You don't think we should be doing something?

01:19:31.634 --> 01:19:35.720
You're gonna climb outside the train again?
No, but make explosion the train will come apart.

01:19:35.803 --> 01:19:41.384
- Lewis! We have to try to do something!
- Klimowski wants to blow up the train!

01:19:41.468 --> 01:19:46.383
- No, we should blow up the coupler!
- We don't have any explosives!

01:19:46.467 --> 01:19:49.634
I have an idea.

01:20:01.633 --> 01:20:04.424
"Compressed gas"

01:20:55.754 --> 01:20:58.421
Down! Down!
Down! Down!

01:20:59.797 --> 01:21:02.588
- Dad?
- Sorry monkey, get back! Get back!

01:21:05.004 --> 01:21:08.878
If this works, we will be in newspaper.

01:21:08.962 --> 01:21:15.418
We will be in newspapers whatever happens.
Then we can't lose.

01:21:47.417 --> 01:21:50.292
Give me the lamp!

01:21:50.375 --> 01:21:52.876
Give me the lamp!

01:22:00.165 --> 01:22:02.499
I can see the coupling!

01:22:07.041 --> 01:22:10.833
Take this and get to the back.
For the brake.

01:22:10.916 --> 01:22:14.708
You're a good boy - aren't you.

01:22:31.664 --> 01:22:34.956
Come on, Max.

01:22:38.287 --> 01:22:41.205
Come on!

01:22:59.786 --> 01:23:04.453
- Jan! Get to the back with Sarah.
- Where are you going?

01:23:04.537 --> 01:23:07.329
Please Jan, just do as I say just for once! Heh.

01:23:07.412 --> 01:23:11.745
Come on, Lewis!
Give me room!

01:23:24.785 --> 01:23:29.117
Come on, you bastard!

01:23:38.160 --> 01:23:42.077
It's free!
Pull it, Lewis!

01:24:24.197 --> 01:24:26.948
Fuck!

01:24:45.278 --> 01:24:49.738
Jan!
Help Sarah with the handbrake!

01:24:50.321 --> 01:24:55.154
Help Sarah with the handbrake!
She went to the back of the train.

01:24:55.237 --> 01:24:58.654
The Handbrake - at the back!

01:24:58.737 --> 01:25:02.320
Why are you standing there?

01:25:12.570 --> 01:25:17.528
- I heard a scream!
- Lewis is okay. I need your help.
- Come! Come! Come!

01:25:21.028 --> 01:25:25.444
- Max wait here! 
- Help me!

01:25:30.151 --> 01:25:33.069
Come on!

01:25:50.775 --> 01:25:53.567
Diesel...

01:25:53.650 --> 01:25:56.316
Fuck!

01:26:04.274 --> 01:26:08.565
How fast are we going?

01:26:08.648 --> 01:26:14.817
- How fast?
- 55 mph 50! Come on!

01:26:14.900 --> 01:26:19.857
45! - Fuck you!
Fuck you fucking mother!

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:23.398
Come on, Sarah!

01:26:25.230 --> 01:26:28.272
Come on!

01:26:30.563 --> 01:26:34.147
On your mark ...

01:26:34.230 --> 01:26:37.606
... Get set ...

01:27:34.643 --> 01:27:39.726
- Dad
- Lewis?

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.476
Lewis

01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.642
Dad

01:27:47.725 --> 01:27:53.307
- Jan can you see him?
- Come on! Lewis!

01:27:54.766 --> 01:27:58.349
He's over there!
He's over there!

01:28:09.933 --> 01:28:13.015
He's breathing!

01:28:13.097 --> 01:28:17.306
He lives, Max.
He lives!

01:28:53.055 --> 01:28:55.721
Dad?

01:29:35.884 --> 01:29:41.676
Maybe if I had bought ticket,
I could have got refund.

01:29:49.842 --> 01:29:53.216
It's okay Dad.
The ambulance is coming.

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:58.757
You're just hurrying to get to the 
hospital tonight Doctor, aren't you.

01:32:11.747 --> 01:32:14.588
