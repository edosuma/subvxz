WEBVTT

00:03.445 --> 00:05.695
- I can't eat any more.
- Come on. Just a few more bowls.

00:05.789 --> 00:07.088
Mom said we had to
finish the whole thing

00:07.190 --> 00:08.810
before we could cut
the record off the box.

00:08.882 --> 00:10.248
<i>For breakfast back in the '70s,</i>

00:10.350 --> 00:11.983
<i>parents put their trust in any tiger,</i>

00:12.086 --> 00:13.885
<i>Cap'n or chocolate vampire</i>

00:13.987 --> 00:15.620
<i>who'd fill their kids with enough sugar</i>

00:15.723 --> 00:16.922
<i>to send them bouncing out of the house</i>

00:17.024 --> 00:18.423
<i>until the street lights came on.</i>

00:18.525 --> 00:20.926
- Mornin', gents.
- Hey, you want some cereal?

00:21.028 --> 00:23.195
- What record's on the box?
- "Sugar, Sugar" by the Archies.

00:23.297 --> 00:24.629
Get back to me when it's Zeppelin.

00:24.698 --> 00:26.164
I just walked by Mom and Dad's door.

00:26.266 --> 00:27.866
Lots of whispering going on.

00:27.968 --> 00:29.768
Probably a grown-up matter
that's none of our business.

00:29.870 --> 00:31.303
Hmm.

00:35.109 --> 00:37.175
<i>Nowadays, parents tend to
include their little darlings</i>

00:37.277 --> 00:39.177
<i>in every discussion,
no matter how intimate...</i>

00:39.279 --> 00:40.879
<i>drugs, illness, why Mommy</i>

00:40.981 --> 00:42.647
<i>goes on solo trips
with her personal trainer...</i>

00:42.750 --> 00:44.983
<i>But in 1972, my folks practiced</i>

00:45.085 --> 00:47.352
<i>the "none of your beeswax"
approach to parenting.</i>

00:47.454 --> 00:49.488
I'm so nervous. My hands are shaking.

00:49.590 --> 00:51.089
Pretty sure that's the sugar.

00:51.191 --> 00:52.624
Well, we better go find Eddie then.

00:52.726 --> 00:54.326
Bail, bail, bail, bail!

00:55.591 --> 00:58.505

00:58.565 --> 00:59.865
Your mom and I are going out.

00:59.967 --> 01:01.066
You have to keep an eye on the baby.

01:01.168 --> 01:02.134
I'm kind of busy.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.268
Unless that rest of that sentence

01:03.370 --> 01:05.003
is "finding a new place to live," here.

01:08.575 --> 01:10.542
Weekday morning and Dad's missing work?

01:10.644 --> 01:12.778
He didn't even do that
when William was born.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.280
I remember. It hurt my feelings.

01:15.382 --> 01:18.150
And Mom never leaves the house
unless it's an emergency.

01:18.252 --> 01:19.951
Maybe the house is on fire.

01:20.053 --> 01:21.486
No, they'd at least take the baby.

01:21.588 --> 01:23.321
And they'd tell us.

01:23.423 --> 01:24.990
Probably.

01:25.092 --> 01:26.792
We need to get to the bottom of this.

01:26.817 --> 01:27.949
You two, come with me.

01:27.988 --> 01:29.855
- William, stall them.
- How?

01:29.957 --> 01:31.390
Just hold their attention for a minute.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.058
I couldn't even do that by being born.

01:33.160 --> 01:35.093
It's go time. Let's do this.

01:35.195 --> 01:36.895
Oh, um, hey! Hey!

01:36.997 --> 01:39.120
I was wondering if I could
ask you guys something.

01:39.183 --> 01:41.617
- What?
- Uh...

01:41.719 --> 01:46.021
This whole Vietnam quagmire,
I mean, how do we get out of that?

01:48.025 --> 01:49.692
- I'm gonna suffocate!
- You're small.

01:49.794 --> 01:51.861
You don't need much air.
Just keep your ears open.

01:51.963 --> 01:53.329
I can breathe through my ears?

01:53.431 --> 01:55.431
If you get caught,
this is all your idea.

01:55.533 --> 01:58.033
They know I don't have ideas.

01:58.136 --> 01:59.702
That kid is weird.

01:59.804 --> 02:02.104
- He just reads too much.
- Tell him to knock it off.

02:02.206 --> 02:03.439
We'll be back later.

02:03.541 --> 02:05.141
Try not to read while we're gone.

02:05.241 --> 02:06.733
Okay.

02:08.112 --> 02:11.147
No! No, no, no!
Get down, get down, get down!

02:11.249 --> 02:13.382
Looks like another blessing from God.

02:13.484 --> 02:15.050
Mm-hmm.

02:15.153 --> 02:17.553
Maybe you'll finally get
that girl you always wanted.

02:17.655 --> 02:19.155
That'd be nice.

02:19.257 --> 02:21.524
Ran out of boys' names
I liked four kids ago.

02:21.626 --> 02:23.559
Wasn't Pat supposed to be Pete?

02:23.661 --> 02:26.328
I was so loopy on those drugs,
I spelled it wrong.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.664
By the way, I want those drugs again.

02:28.766 --> 02:31.300
Sleeping through it really made
the whole experience special.

02:31.402 --> 02:33.202
Oh, it'll be special either way.

02:33.304 --> 02:35.304
I mean, we're welcoming
another blessed bundle.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.540
Well, Peggy.

02:37.642 --> 02:39.875
False alarm. Sorry to say
you're not expecting.

02:39.977 --> 02:42.178
Yes!

02:42.280 --> 02:43.679
Whoo!

02:46.284 --> 02:49.351
Guess we weren't so happy about
another blessed bundle.

02:49.453 --> 02:51.487
I was happy,

02:51.589 --> 02:56.325
but now I'm happy in
a different... happier way.

02:58.296 --> 03:00.196
How's your day goin', pal?

03:05.503 --> 03:07.236
Come on, hon.

03:07.338 --> 03:09.338
You must be a little relieved.

03:10.675 --> 03:12.441
I am.

03:12.543 --> 03:14.610
You disappointed you're not
gonna get those drugs anymore?

03:14.712 --> 03:16.879
I still have to have that cyst
removed, so I'll get the drugs.

03:16.981 --> 03:18.113
Mm.

03:18.284 --> 03:20.851
No, I'm just surprised.

03:20.953 --> 03:22.586
I thought we both wanted this,

03:22.688 --> 03:24.621
and the truth is, neither of us did.

03:24.723 --> 03:27.157
How many kids have we
been pretending that for?

03:27.259 --> 03:28.825
I'd like to hear your number first

03:28.928 --> 03:30.661
in case it's smaller than eight.

03:30.763 --> 03:32.696
- I'm kidding.
- Is it weird

03:32.798 --> 03:34.531
you and I have never really talked

03:34.633 --> 03:36.333
about how many kids we wanted?

03:36.435 --> 03:38.802
We put more discussion
into buying a new toaster.

03:38.904 --> 03:41.004
Well, a toaster is something
you can do something about.

03:41.106 --> 03:42.472
Kids just happen.

03:42.574 --> 03:44.274
At least for us.

03:46.545 --> 03:47.844
Should've gone with
the four-slice toaster.

03:47.947 --> 03:49.513
I know. I'm kicking myself.

03:50.616 --> 03:53.350
This operation, it's really necessary

03:53.452 --> 03:55.185
or is it one of those scams
like when they wanted

03:55.287 --> 03:57.521
- to take out Eddie's appendix?
- Well, it's a benign cyst,

03:57.623 --> 03:58.822
but I guess it is necessary,

03:58.924 --> 04:01.091
since it's what caused the false alarm.

04:01.193 --> 04:03.472
At least I'll get to be in
the hospital for three days.

04:03.552 --> 04:04.644
Are you worried?

04:04.714 --> 04:08.316
About my house being torn
to pieces while I'm gone.

04:10.369 --> 04:12.002
As long as you'll be okay.

04:12.104 --> 04:13.537
I should be fine.

04:13.639 --> 04:16.005
You heard Doctor Shaff.

04:16.108 --> 04:17.507
It's just a little cyst.

04:20.389 --> 04:23.055
Mom said we're having a little sister!

04:27.104 --> 04:29.166
- Are you sure?
- That's what Mom said.

04:29.245 --> 04:32.221
- A little sister.
- So irresponsible.

04:32.299 --> 04:34.274
Our resources
are overstretched as it is.

04:34.345 --> 04:35.945
Mom and Dad should've
stopped plopping out babies

04:36.014 --> 04:38.381
- three kids ago. Nothing personal.
- No, I get it.

04:38.483 --> 04:40.516
The problem is, they love
each other very much,

04:40.585 --> 04:42.485
and when two people love
each other, babies come.

04:42.587 --> 04:45.021
- Or when they're just bored.
- I like having a little sister.

04:45.089 --> 04:47.623
We can be like Jody and Buffy
on "Family Affair."

04:47.725 --> 04:49.158
They're not really brother and sister.

04:49.227 --> 04:50.860
- They're just actors.
- Yeah, and so fake.

04:50.962 --> 04:52.528
I mean, TV does that all the time.

04:52.630 --> 04:53.763
Kids who look nothing alike

04:53.865 --> 04:55.665
pretending to be the same family.

04:55.767 --> 04:57.900
Guys, I just thought of another problem.

04:58.002 --> 04:59.902
Girls need privacy.

05:00.004 --> 05:02.238
She's gonna need her own room.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.607
Buffy can sleep with Mom.

05:04.709 --> 05:07.209
And Dad can move into our bedroom!

05:07.311 --> 05:09.078
We have to bunk with Dad?

05:09.180 --> 05:10.880
I hate Buffy.

05:10.982 --> 05:13.449
You're right. It's not a great name.

05:13.551 --> 05:15.184
I'm gonna go think of a better one.

05:15.286 --> 05:17.520
I-I think maybe we should run
this by Eddie and Lawrence.

05:18.656 --> 05:22.658
But now that I'm here,
you're glad, right?

05:24.162 --> 05:25.327
Sure.

05:26.397 --> 05:27.563
You're gonna have to step up

05:27.665 --> 05:29.165
feeding those kids while I'm away.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.100
Oh, yeah, you're gonna need
more milk for breakfast.

05:31.169 --> 05:32.702
I just bought eight half-gallons.

05:32.804 --> 05:34.036
It'd be cheaper to buy a cow.

05:34.138 --> 05:35.337
Well, maybe Pat would finally shut up

05:35.406 --> 05:36.639
about that dog he wants.

05:36.741 --> 05:37.840
They like Pop-Tarts and Eggos, too,

05:37.942 --> 05:39.041
but you'll have to toast those...

05:39.143 --> 05:40.276
two at a time.

05:40.378 --> 05:41.510
Okay, there's plenty of stuff in here

05:41.612 --> 05:43.012
for three days worth of dinners.

05:43.114 --> 05:44.814
Monday night is frozen pizza
and tater tots,

05:44.916 --> 05:46.782
but don't give Pat any pizza
until he finishes all his tots.

05:46.884 --> 05:49.552
No way she's expecting.
Pat must've heard wrong.

05:49.654 --> 05:52.288
Plus, doctors can't even tell
it's a girl until it's born.

05:52.356 --> 05:54.523
If Mom was expecting, I would know.

05:54.625 --> 05:56.492
I've got my ear pressed to the ground.

05:56.561 --> 05:58.394
And your nose pressed
to Mom and Dad's butts.

05:58.496 --> 06:00.362
Oh, yeah? Better than you having yours

06:00.431 --> 06:02.431
pressed to their, uh... to their...

06:02.533 --> 06:05.034
To... To their what?

06:05.103 --> 06:06.435
You got nothing.

06:06.537 --> 06:08.137
Yeah, if you guys
are worried about this,

06:08.239 --> 06:09.772
you should just ask Mom.

06:09.874 --> 06:11.207
You know, she's very approachable.

06:11.309 --> 06:12.441
No, we can't ask them.

06:12.543 --> 06:13.876
This is delicate stuff.

06:13.945 --> 06:15.344
They wouldn't tell us the truth anyway.

06:15.446 --> 06:17.079
They think if we have
too much information,

06:17.181 --> 06:19.515
we might rise up against them.

06:19.617 --> 06:21.117
And they're not wrong.

06:23.187 --> 06:25.721
Apparently, Pat has some
cockamamie shrimp allergy,

06:25.823 --> 06:28.357
so if you open a can of that
Chun King Shrimp Chow Mein,

06:28.459 --> 06:29.625
he only gets a small portion.

06:29.727 --> 06:31.193
Allergies.

06:31.295 --> 06:33.329
I don't know where these doctors
come up with this stuff.

06:33.431 --> 06:34.897
You know, Mike,

06:34.999 --> 06:36.565
I've been thinking about

06:36.667 --> 06:39.135
how we don't want another kid right now.

06:39.237 --> 06:40.970
There might be a way
to be smart about it.

06:41.072 --> 06:42.872
Honey, we're not allowed
to be smart about it.

06:42.950 --> 06:43.908
We're Catholics.

06:43.994 --> 06:47.647
Right, but there are some things
we can do and not do.

06:47.712 --> 06:50.513
I hope you're not suggesting
what I think you're suggesting.

06:50.615 --> 06:54.784
Because I like it, and it's
free, so I'm not giving it up.

06:54.886 --> 06:56.552
I like that it's free, too.

06:56.654 --> 06:57.921
We wouldn't have to give anything up.

06:57.999 --> 06:59.989
Just plan ahead and schedule it.

07:00.091 --> 07:02.057
I'll grab the TV Guide.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.860
We can see if there's any duds
on "Carson" next week.

07:04.962 --> 07:06.962
It's about my schedule, not Johnny's.

07:07.064 --> 07:09.198
There's certain days out of the
month where I'm more likely...

07:09.300 --> 07:10.966
Oh, I see where this is going.

07:11.068 --> 07:12.368
You already get the one week off,

07:12.470 --> 07:14.036
and now you want to add black-out days.

07:14.138 --> 07:15.871
I'm trying to stick to
the Church's rules.

07:15.973 --> 07:17.373
If it were up to me,
we could try some of these new

07:17.475 --> 07:19.341
tricks everyone's talking about.

07:19.443 --> 07:21.243
You know, it's not just
rubbers anymore, Mike.

07:21.345 --> 07:25.014
They've got cups and rings
and pills and hoops.

07:25.116 --> 07:27.049
I mean, the Protestants
have a whole magic show

07:27.151 --> 07:29.185
- going on down there.
- And they're having a pretty good time,

07:29.287 --> 07:31.053
- but we know better.
- Do we?

07:31.155 --> 07:32.721
I get it. The Pope wants more Catholics,

07:32.824 --> 07:35.324
but we've already given them
almost a whole baseball team.

07:36.427 --> 07:37.593
Guys! Guys! Guys!

07:37.695 --> 07:39.128
I have fresh intel.

07:39.230 --> 07:41.197
Mom is going away for three days.

07:41.299 --> 07:42.726
Three days?!

07:42.781 --> 07:44.335
Oh, and we're having lasagna on Tuesday.

07:44.402 --> 07:47.039
What? Lasagna is a weekend food.

07:47.117 --> 07:48.316
None of this makes any sense.

07:48.418 --> 07:50.051
Where would Mom go for three days?

07:50.153 --> 07:51.419
And once she's seen the outside world,

07:51.521 --> 07:53.021
why would she ever come back?

07:53.123 --> 07:55.223
They're in the bedroom right now
talking about it.

07:56.459 --> 07:59.027
I feel like I'm sinning just
having this conversation.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.598
I need to go to Confession.

08:03.700 --> 08:05.033
That's a thought.

08:05.135 --> 08:06.634
I'll take this up with Father Dunne.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.169
Maybe there's an option
we haven't thought about...

08:08.271 --> 08:10.438
one they only give you
if you make a fuss.

08:10.540 --> 08:12.674
I'll bet he'll side with
the Pope on this one.

08:12.776 --> 08:14.575
He knows where his bread is buttered.

08:16.446 --> 08:18.479
I-I'm gonna kill you!

08:18.581 --> 08:20.648
- You're choking me to death!
- Take it outside.

08:25.422 --> 08:26.821
Eddie, we're going to Confession.

08:26.923 --> 08:29.290
- Watch the baby.
- I'm on the case.

08:29.392 --> 08:31.025
You don't always have to say
things in a weird way.

08:31.127 --> 08:32.460
Aye aye, Mom!

08:32.562 --> 08:33.895
So, what do we know?

08:33.996 --> 08:35.730
Pat heard something he didn't understand

08:35.832 --> 08:37.932
and Mom's going away for three days.

08:38.034 --> 08:39.866
Don't forget weekday lasagna.

08:39.970 --> 08:42.203
I told you, the lasagna's a blind alley.

08:42.304 --> 08:43.837
And now they're going to Confession

08:43.940 --> 08:45.440
to talk things over with Father Dunne.

08:45.508 --> 08:48.209
Then we need ears inside
that confessional.

08:48.311 --> 08:49.978
It's time.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.646
We'll use the kit.

08:53.650 --> 08:55.016
What kit?

08:55.841 --> 08:57.018
- Wow!
- Wow!

08:57.120 --> 08:58.853
<i>It was Joey's spy kit.</i>

08:58.955 --> 09:00.888
<i>Everything we needed to crack
this case wide-open...</i>

09:00.991 --> 09:02.323
<i>invisible ink, a periscope,</i>

09:02.392 --> 09:03.691
<i>a gun that turned into a camera,</i>

09:03.793 --> 09:05.026
<i>a camera that turned into a gun,</i>

09:05.128 --> 09:07.428
- <i>and best of all...</i>
- Disguises?!

09:07.530 --> 09:08.830
Okay, where'd you get this?

09:08.932 --> 09:11.199
Deals were made. Grades were changed.

09:11.267 --> 09:12.926
Let's just say if Scotty Stancroft

09:12.989 --> 09:16.771
ever actually becomes a doctor,
I wouldn't let him cut <i> me</i> open.

09:16.873 --> 09:19.440
<i>Funny story... Scotty Stancroft
actually did become a doctor</i>

09:19.509 --> 09:21.275
<i>and he ended up on "20/20."</i>

09:28.952 --> 09:31.085
I've spotted the subject's car.

09:33.000 --> 09:39.074

10:12.362 --> 10:15.129
We've lived our life
one way for all these years

10:15.231 --> 10:17.899
believing everything the Church
asked us to believe

10:18.001 --> 10:19.467
without too much griping.

10:19.569 --> 10:21.269
And we appreciate that.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.870
We hate the whiners.

10:22.972 --> 10:24.739
I mean, to the extent that we're allowed

10:24.841 --> 10:26.374
to hate any of our flock.

10:26.476 --> 10:28.976
I don't mind all the rules.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.245
You know, it's been great
not having to think too hard

10:31.347 --> 10:34.615
about stuff... just letting
life wash over me.

10:34.717 --> 10:39.687
But now my wife has been
bringing up questions.

10:39.789 --> 10:41.255
Oof, sounds rough.

10:41.357 --> 10:44.258
You're selling me on celibacy
all over again.

11:15.492 --> 11:18.192
- The eagle has landed.
- There's an eagle?

11:18.294 --> 11:19.727
He put the microphone in her purse.

11:19.829 --> 11:21.295
- Then just say that.
- Are you hungry?

11:21.397 --> 11:22.830
Why are you being so mean to me?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.365
You know what? I did skip lunch.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.733
Shh!

11:25.835 --> 11:28.002
- What's she's saying?
- All I'm hearing is static.

11:28.104 --> 11:29.337
Wait.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.507
Someone's talking about the Dodgers.

11:32.609 --> 11:35.143
They're down 4 to 3 in the 7th.

11:35.245 --> 11:38.479
It just feels like abstinence
isn't realistic for us.

11:38.581 --> 11:41.149
The man, God bless him,
can't get enough of me.

11:41.251 --> 11:42.984
I want to be a good Catholic,
but after eight kids,

11:43.086 --> 11:44.852
it seems like the Church
owes me some wiggle-room.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.554
Uh-huh. I feel like I'm not being heard.

11:46.656 --> 11:48.422
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

11:48.525 --> 11:50.191
How about a few more options?

11:50.293 --> 11:51.759
I mean, is there anything else
the Church is okay with

11:51.861 --> 11:53.261
to help us not have kids?

11:53.363 --> 11:55.029
- Yes!
- Oh, great.

11:55.131 --> 11:57.064
- What is it?
- Oh, uh,

11:57.167 --> 11:59.667
say four Hail Marys and one Our Father.

11:59.769 --> 12:01.169
Well, if that worked,
we wouldn't have Eddie.

12:01.271 --> 12:02.703
- Amazing!
- What?!

12:02.805 --> 12:04.338
Buckner just hit one out!

12:09.179 --> 12:10.611
Why, Peggy!

12:10.713 --> 12:11.879
Oh. Hi, Helen.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.714
- Hi.
- Pretty flowers.

12:13.816 --> 12:15.216
- Yes, they're from my garden.
- Mm.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.019
The Altar Ladies and I
just doing our part.

12:18.121 --> 12:19.587
I'm sure God loves your flowers.

12:19.689 --> 12:21.022
I mean, He made them.

12:21.124 --> 12:22.890
You just killed them
and brought them here.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.126
You know, we haven't seen you
at bingo in a long time.

12:25.228 --> 12:26.928
Maybe you should come by Monday night.

12:27.030 --> 12:29.397
Oh, I'm having an operation on Monday.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.266
Nothing serious.
Just a little ovarian cyst.

12:32.368 --> 12:33.568
- Oh.
- Yeah.

12:33.670 --> 12:34.902
Doctor O'Brien?

12:35.004 --> 12:37.238
- No, Shaff. Why?
- Oh.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.574
Well, perhaps I shouldn't say anything,

12:39.676 --> 12:43.144
but Doctor O'Brien is
a Catholic and a very dear man.

12:43.246 --> 12:44.979
I don't think there will be
much time for small talk.

12:45.081 --> 12:46.747
I'm hoping to be zonked out.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.983
Well, no, what I mean
is if Doctor O'Brien

12:49.085 --> 12:52.119
does the operation,
he can do it in a bigger way

12:52.222 --> 12:56.224
so that a cyst or anything else
can't grow down there.

12:56.326 --> 12:58.626
It's a kindness he does
for Catholic women

12:58.728 --> 13:01.429
who have been blessed with more
than their share of blessings.

13:01.531 --> 13:03.622
Isn't that considered "family planning"?

13:03.647 --> 13:04.676
How could it be?

13:04.701 --> 13:06.500
You're having a necessary operation,

13:06.603 --> 13:08.169
the scope of which is up to the doctor

13:08.271 --> 13:09.837
who uses his best judgment.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.740
That sounds pretty scientific
for the Catholic Church.

13:12.842 --> 13:15.009
Are you sure the Church
is okay with this?

13:15.111 --> 13:17.612
Bonnie Burns actually
spoke to the Bishop

13:17.714 --> 13:19.680
before getting hers, just to be sure.

13:19.782 --> 13:21.482
- Bonnie did this?
- Yes!

13:21.584 --> 13:23.985
All I heard her say is that it's
something Catholic couples do

13:24.087 --> 13:25.353
that Mom thinks is wrong.

13:25.455 --> 13:26.921
And her friend Bonnie Burns did it.

13:27.023 --> 13:28.322
Oh, my God.

13:28.424 --> 13:30.758
That's easy. It's divorce.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.493
- What?
- Absolutely.

13:32.595 --> 13:34.662
Mrs. Burns is that tasty divorcée.

13:34.764 --> 13:36.364
The one who wears hot pants to mass.

13:36.466 --> 13:38.833
She's the reason I sometimes
can't stand up for communion.

13:38.935 --> 13:40.635
Mom and Dad are getting a divorce?

13:40.737 --> 13:43.004
It's the '70s.
Divorce is the new reality.

13:43.106 --> 13:44.772
I don't want them getting a divorce.

13:44.874 --> 13:47.341
The important thing is now
they can compete for our love

13:47.443 --> 13:48.809
instead of the other way around.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.145
Two birthdays, two Christmases.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.014
Maybe a Hanukkah.

13:53.116 --> 13:55.981
I'm picturing Mom ending up with
Mr. Cohen from the dry cleaners.

13:59.278 --> 14:00.367
Now, all things considered,

14:00.422 --> 14:01.850
I think the Doctor O'Brien version

14:01.875 --> 14:03.266
of the surgery is the way to go.

14:03.321 --> 14:05.555
I can't even believe we're
having this conversation.

14:06.235 --> 14:07.863
Look, you're talking about
letting them take out stuff

14:07.930 --> 14:09.262
they don't have to.

14:09.332 --> 14:11.739
It's barbaric,
and it probably costs extra.

14:11.841 --> 14:13.040
But then we'd be done, Mike.

14:13.142 --> 14:14.775
And we could keep our life
the way it is,

14:14.877 --> 14:17.345
with no "black-out days,"
so we don't have to suffer.

14:17.447 --> 14:18.980
But that's what makes it so sketchy.

14:19.082 --> 14:20.548
You do something fun,

14:20.616 --> 14:22.149
you're supposed to get hit
with a little suffering.

14:22.251 --> 14:24.018
That's the deal. Jesus knew.

14:24.087 --> 14:27.722
He had a nice dinner with his
friends, and the next day, that.

14:27.824 --> 14:29.623
Oh, I told you,
Helen and Bonnie looked into it.

14:29.692 --> 14:31.592
- They say it's fine.
- Helen is a degenerate

14:31.694 --> 14:32.760
with a serious bingo problem,

14:32.829 --> 14:34.562
and Bonnie wore a halter top
to a christening,

14:34.664 --> 14:35.930
so please forgive me
if I don't look to them

14:36.032 --> 14:37.665
- for moral guidance.
- The Bishop himself

14:37.767 --> 14:39.800
- gave Bonnie the thumbs-up.
- Yeah, and I bet she wore that

14:39.902 --> 14:41.836
- halter top when she asked him.
- That halter top really made

14:41.938 --> 14:44.171
- a big impression on you, didn't it?
- It was a christening.

14:44.273 --> 14:46.407
It made it very hard for
the baby to concentrate.

14:46.509 --> 14:48.676
Look, I am struggling
with this stuff, too.

14:48.745 --> 14:50.878
I even prayed on it.

14:50.980 --> 14:53.381
Maybe I need to go back and talk
to Father Dunne some more.

14:53.449 --> 14:55.750
Sure. You and the priest
and the bishop and the doctor...

14:55.852 --> 14:57.485
all these men...
get to have big opinions

14:57.553 --> 14:59.153
about whether or not I have another kid.

14:59.255 --> 15:00.721
No one seems to care what I want!

15:00.823 --> 15:03.557
The only person who's really tried
to support me in this is Helen!

15:03.659 --> 15:05.259
And I don't even like her.

15:09.866 --> 15:11.899
- Can you hear anything?
- More arguing,

15:12.001 --> 15:14.001
but Mom walked out, so we missed it.

15:17.006 --> 15:18.272
Peg.

15:18.374 --> 15:19.507
I hear crying.

15:19.609 --> 15:20.908
Is it Dad or the baby?

15:21.010 --> 15:22.276
Just the baby so far.

15:27.216 --> 15:29.283
<i>Dad's instinct was always
that he should take the lead</i>

15:29.385 --> 15:31.185
<i>in all important family decisions.</i>

15:31.254 --> 15:32.748
- I can handle it.
- It's okay.

15:32.803 --> 15:34.537
Go watch TV or something.
I'll do what I do.

15:34.639 --> 15:36.105
<i>It started to dawn on Dad, however,</i>

15:36.174 --> 15:37.673
<i>that each child they added to the family</i>

15:37.775 --> 15:39.608
<i>meant more responsibility and more work.</i>

15:39.710 --> 15:43.212
<i>And not really for him, but for Mom.</i>

15:43.314 --> 15:44.547
Now Mom's back.

15:44.615 --> 15:46.315
She just took Andy away from Dad, and...

15:46.417 --> 15:48.350
Oh, he just spit on her.

15:48.419 --> 15:50.920
Dad spit on her? Divorce gets ugly.

15:51.022 --> 15:52.121
Sounds like he stopped crying.

15:52.223 --> 15:53.455
Mom put him down in the crib.

15:53.558 --> 15:55.291
Now she's going to the dresser.

15:55.393 --> 15:56.458
She's pulling something out.

15:59.730 --> 16:00.729
She's undressing.

16:00.831 --> 16:02.097
Pull me up! Pull me up! Pull me up!

16:02.200 --> 16:03.899
Pull me up!

16:04.001 --> 16:05.701
A divorce? That's your new theory?

16:05.770 --> 16:08.070
Oh, maybe the baby they were
having earlier today

16:08.172 --> 16:09.838
was them trying to save their marriage.

16:09.907 --> 16:11.707
There's evidence, okay? The arguing,

16:11.809 --> 16:14.743
her going away, her talking
about breaking Church rules.

16:14.845 --> 16:17.780
Face it. We're gonna be
children of a broken home.

16:17.882 --> 16:20.716
- I bet I could get a mini bike out of this.
- I blame Dad.

16:20.818 --> 16:22.151
The way she slaves around here

16:22.253 --> 16:24.286
with no appreciation from anyone but me.

16:24.388 --> 16:26.622
To be fair, Mom's not exactly
a day in the park.

16:26.691 --> 16:27.890
You shut your mouth.

16:27.992 --> 16:29.391
She's a day in the park in spring.

16:29.493 --> 16:31.360
Okay, a lot of issues here.

16:31.429 --> 16:33.629
- Some more disturbing than others.
- Yeah! Really!?

16:33.731 --> 16:34.897
Mom and Dad are splitting up!

16:34.999 --> 16:36.365
We don't know that for sure.

16:36.467 --> 16:37.700
- I just listed all...
- Guys! Guys!

16:37.802 --> 16:39.268
There's an obvious way to find out.

16:39.337 --> 16:41.170
Ah, yes, by breaking into divorce court

16:41.272 --> 16:43.072
and rifling through the files.
We'll have to steal a lamp

16:43.174 --> 16:44.573
or something to make it look
like a burglary,

16:44.675 --> 16:45.808
but once we get our hands...

16:45.910 --> 16:48.644
Or we could just ask Mom and Dad.

16:48.713 --> 16:51.914
Honest, regular talking without
any subterfuge or spying.

16:53.284 --> 16:54.917
I-I don't understand.

16:55.019 --> 16:56.852
How are you not in jail yet?

16:56.921 --> 16:58.954
I can pass any lie detector test.

17:01.058 --> 17:02.424
<i>That didn't work, did it?</i>

17:02.526 --> 17:03.525
<i>Maybe next time.</i>

17:03.628 --> 17:05.928
We need to have a family meeting.

17:06.030 --> 17:08.230
About what?
Where I'm gonna bury your body?

17:08.332 --> 17:09.462
I was watching that.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.201
They just want to know
what's happening around here.

17:11.202 --> 17:12.935
I just want to know what's
happening on "Banacek."

17:13.037 --> 17:14.936
They've been hearing a lot
of whispering and arguing.

17:15.039 --> 17:16.739
Are you and Mom talking about divorce?

17:16.840 --> 17:18.906
I wouldn't talk to your father
about divorce.

17:19.010 --> 17:21.310
I'd just hightail it to Tijuana
and send him the papers.

17:21.412 --> 17:23.612
Very sensible. That's why I married you.

17:23.714 --> 17:25.047
I'm going to Tijuana with Mom.

17:25.148 --> 17:27.282
- I want to live with Dad.
- Who invited you?

17:27.385 --> 17:28.851
- Mom?
- Eh...

17:28.953 --> 17:30.719
Let's all calm down.
There's no point in taking sides

17:30.788 --> 17:32.121
- when we don't even know...
- I choose Dad!

17:32.223 --> 17:33.789
I want Mom!
Mostly because of her spaghetti.

17:33.891 --> 17:35.257
Nobody likes a suck-up.

17:35.359 --> 17:36.859
But you will be getting
an extra meatball.

17:36.961 --> 17:38.494
- Yes!
- Let me just say

17:38.562 --> 17:40.462
I completely support this life decision

17:40.564 --> 17:43.632
and will be happy to divide my
time between the both of you.

17:43.734 --> 17:46.435
Also, my love can be purchased
for the price of one mini bike.

17:46.537 --> 17:49.438
I just want to be clear that in
the event of a divorce,

17:49.540 --> 17:51.407
- I don't want any of you.
- You're not sticking them with me.

17:51.509 --> 17:53.575
First thing I'd do is dump
all of you at juvie hall,

17:53.678 --> 17:56.845
get myself a bachelor pad like Banacek.

17:56.947 --> 17:58.380
- Can I come?
- Absolutely.

17:58.482 --> 18:00.549
Look, I don't know where
you clowns got this crap,

18:00.651 --> 18:02.141
but your mother and I are not
getting any divorces.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.155
Honestly.

18:03.180 --> 18:05.345
- Really?
- If we did, it's important to know

18:05.423 --> 18:07.690
that it would be entirely your fault.

18:07.792 --> 18:10.659
- You mean us kids?
- No, you specifically.

18:11.996 --> 18:14.229
He's kidding.

18:14.332 --> 18:16.131
You'd all be to blame.

18:16.233 --> 18:18.067
Your father and I were blissfully happy

18:18.169 --> 18:20.502
before you animals came along,
and we won't let you beat us.

18:20.604 --> 18:23.038
No way. We are Catholics.

18:23.140 --> 18:24.640
We hang in until the bitter end.

18:24.742 --> 18:26.208
Until one of us stands
over the other one

18:26.310 --> 18:28.043
and watches them die.

18:28.145 --> 18:30.179
Oh, honey, so romantic.

18:30.281 --> 18:31.947
I mean it, Peg.

18:32.049 --> 18:34.983
Well, maybe we can avoid
any confusion in the future

18:35.086 --> 18:37.086
if you guys were a little bit
more open with us.

18:37.188 --> 18:38.487
Okay.

18:38.556 --> 18:42.091
Well, maybe there is
one thing you should know.

18:42.193 --> 18:44.660
I'm gonna be having
an operation on Monday.

18:44.762 --> 18:45.661
What?

18:45.763 --> 18:46.962
I'm gonna be fine.

18:47.064 --> 18:48.297
I'm gonna be gone for three days,

18:48.399 --> 18:49.798
and then I'm coming back.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.000
As tempting as the sweet
rest of death might be.

18:52.103 --> 18:54.002
What about all the arguing we heard?

18:54.105 --> 18:56.505
Oh, you know how your mom gets...

18:56.607 --> 18:59.408
when I'm being pig-headed.

18:59.510 --> 19:01.744
There was this important
decision we were trying to make

19:01.846 --> 19:06.615
that... well, it turns out is
mostly not my decision at all.

19:06.717 --> 19:08.951
It's hers.

19:09.053 --> 19:12.154
I was wrong, but your mom
forgives me, right?

19:13.524 --> 19:15.090
Yes, I do.

19:16.927 --> 19:20.129
See, no divorce.

19:20.231 --> 19:23.799
Turn on "Banacek" and get out.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.601
<i>This was a big deal...</i>

19:25.703 --> 19:27.636
<i>my mom and dad opening up
with personal details</i>

19:27.738 --> 19:29.304
<i>and feelings like never before...</i>

19:29.407 --> 19:31.974
Um, so, the surgery you're having.

19:32.076 --> 19:34.443
- What kind of operation is it?
- Well, funny you should ask.

19:34.545 --> 19:35.844
It's a None-Of-Your-Business-ectomy.

19:35.946 --> 19:37.012
Now, beat it!

19:37.114 --> 19:38.647
<i>And then, right back to normal.</i>

19:42.610 --> 19:43.930
Weirdos.

19:44.916 --> 19:47.087
- Mommy?
- Yeah, Pat?

19:47.173 --> 19:50.329
I've been thinking a lot
about my new baby sister.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.423
- Baby sister?
- I named her Kathy.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.177
It's a lot better name than Buffy.

19:54.240 --> 19:55.760
Neither one is great.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.361
But listen,

19:57.430 --> 19:59.530
I don't know if you'll be
getting a baby sister, Pat.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.599
But I really, really want one.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.034
See, I already got Kathy a present.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.236
Pinky Bear.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.637
I want to give her to Kathy

20:06.706 --> 20:08.606
so she won't feel alone
being the only girl.

20:08.708 --> 20:11.675
Aww, that's very generous of you.

20:11.778 --> 20:15.513
If Kathy does show up one day,
I'll see that she gets this.

20:15.615 --> 20:17.148
Thanks, Mom.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.485
You ready for bed?

20:21.587 --> 20:23.187
Yeah.

20:23.289 --> 20:28.225
And, um, I've made a decision
about the operation on Monday.

20:29.462 --> 20:32.029
Okay.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.497
Good.

20:35.601 --> 20:37.034
What are you doing with Pat's bear?

20:37.136 --> 20:38.869
Oh, I've been trying to get this

20:38.971 --> 20:40.882
grimy thing away from him for months.

20:43.698 --> 20:47.433
