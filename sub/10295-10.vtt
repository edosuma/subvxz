01:38.601 --> 01:40.534
Kelly, breakfast!

01:40.569 --> 01:42.067
And be quiet, honey!

01:42.102 --> 01:43.801
Don't wake your father!

01:45.300 --> 01:47.968
Oh, Bud, you eat so fast.

01:48.003 --> 01:51.133
That's because
you cook so good.

01:51.168 --> 01:52.601
Bye, Mom.

01:52.636 --> 01:54.901
Not so fast.
You're not going anywhere

01:54.936 --> 01:56.567
without a good,
healthy breakfast.

01:56.602 --> 01:58.133
Mother, I'm 15.
I'm old enough

01:58.168 --> 02:00.868
to know how to use
a vending machine.

02:00.903 --> 02:02.667
Get over here
and eat.

02:02.702 --> 02:05.601
God, I hate
to eat sitting down.

02:05.636 --> 02:09.334
I think she should
clean her plate like I did.

02:09.369 --> 02:10.434
Sure, Mom.

02:16.267 --> 02:17.434
I'm stuffed.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.968
They're waiting for me
at the mall.

02:20.003 --> 02:21.634
What do you do
at the mall, anyway?

02:21.669 --> 02:22.801
Nothing.

02:22.836 --> 02:25.400
You know
what they do?

02:25.435 --> 02:26.968
Sometimes they look
in the shoe store...

02:27.003 --> 02:30.100
and laugh at Daddy.

02:31.267 --> 02:33.968
Well, all the kids do.

02:34.003 --> 02:36.801
It's not like
they know he's my father.

02:36.836 --> 02:38.234
And they never will,

02:38.269 --> 02:41.767
if you want to live
to hang your next rat.

02:41.802 --> 02:44.801
I'd ground
both of you,

02:44.836 --> 02:48.000
but then that would mean
you'd be here all day.

02:50.234 --> 02:53.100
So, your punishment is
you're grounded tomorrow

02:53.135 --> 02:56.067
when your father's home,
and I'm out shopping.

02:56.102 --> 02:58.534
Can I go now?

02:58.569 --> 02:59.634
Please.

02:59.669 --> 03:01.701
Where's my miniature
golf coupon?

03:01.736 --> 03:03.167
It's in the drawer.

03:06.267 --> 03:08.767
What's this
with the fake engraving?

03:08.802 --> 03:10.267
Oh, that's
the invitation

03:10.302 --> 03:12.267
to your cousin
Harriet's wedding.

03:12.302 --> 03:13.267
Oh, puke.

03:13.302 --> 03:14.534
Harriet.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.267
You don't
have to go.

03:17.302 --> 03:21.267
The thing is, your father and I
have to go out of town for it.

03:21.302 --> 03:23.133
Bud, who can you stay with?

03:23.168 --> 03:26.434
I'm not allowed
in anybody's house.

03:26.469 --> 03:29.300
Well, we'll
find someone.

03:32.135 --> 03:33.601
Daddy's up.

03:33.636 --> 03:35.601
Well, we'll
see you later.

03:35.636 --> 03:36.934
Okay. Be home by 6.

03:36.969 --> 03:38.567
Oh, and Bud,
don't bite anyone.

03:38.602 --> 03:40.567
And Kelly, don't
get anything pierced.

03:40.602 --> 03:41.501
Yeah, Mom.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.467
Morning.

03:55.502 --> 03:56.734
Coffee.

03:56.769 --> 03:57.934
In the pot.

03:57.969 --> 04:02.100
Boy, I love it when you
get up before I do,

04:02.135 --> 04:05.100
and I got the bed
all to myself.

04:05.135 --> 04:07.234
Gee, you'd never know it,

04:07.269 --> 04:11.868
the way you put your foot
on my behind and push.

04:11.903 --> 04:13.267
Here's your
breakfast, honey.

04:13.302 --> 04:16.033
Mmm. Oh, just
how I like them.

04:18.267 --> 04:21.534
Ah, you dirty,
shiftless bag of-

04:21.569 --> 04:24.501
Al, don't feed that
to the dog.

04:24.536 --> 04:27.200
The cholesterol
is very bad for him.

04:32.267 --> 04:33.300
Bacon?

04:35.267 --> 04:36.868
Boy,
I hate Saturdays.

04:36.903 --> 04:41.000
Damn kids come to the mall
and make fun of me.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.100
Yeah.
Wouldn't it be nice

04:44.135 --> 04:47.033
if we could go off together,
just the two of us?

04:47.068 --> 04:48.601
Not really.

04:50.100 --> 04:53.234
You know where
I'd really like to go?

04:53.269 --> 04:54.234
Where?

04:54.269 --> 04:55.400
Milwaukee.

04:55.435 --> 04:58.167
I smell your family
coming on.

04:58.202 --> 05:00.734
What's up, Peg,
Beer Fest '87?

05:00.769 --> 05:03.200
Is it time
for your mother

05:03.235 --> 05:05.534
to defend her
keg-sucking crown?

05:07.167 --> 05:08.968
Is she moving up

05:09.003 --> 05:11.167
into the heavyweight division
this year?

05:11.202 --> 05:13.400
Can't stand
that a woman won, huh?

05:13.435 --> 05:15.234
Hey, there were
a lot of people there

05:15.269 --> 05:18.267
demanding
chromosome tests.

05:18.302 --> 05:20.234
Just you and Dad.

05:20.269 --> 05:22.200
I don't care, Peg.

05:22.235 --> 05:24.234
I'm not going to one
of your family gatherings.

05:24.269 --> 05:25.767
It's not a gathering,
it's a wedding.

05:25.802 --> 05:27.267
Who's getting married?

05:27.302 --> 05:28.267
Harriet.

05:28.302 --> 05:29.434
Harriet?

05:29.469 --> 05:31.734
You mean someone
answered the ad?

05:33.067 --> 05:34.767
Some people
will do anything

05:34.802 --> 05:36.501
to keep
from being deported.

05:36.536 --> 05:39.801
Hey, Jose
is a very nice man,

05:39.836 --> 05:43.300
and his English
is coming along just fine.

05:43.335 --> 05:45.634
<i>Me habla not going.</i>

05:46.901 --> 05:48.400
Al, we have to go.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.734
The whole family
is coming.

05:50.769 --> 05:53.234
Oh, really. How about Elmo,
the human surprise?

05:53.269 --> 05:55.234
Are they bringing him?

05:55.269 --> 05:57.200
You know, he makes
a very good living.

05:57.235 --> 05:59.868
Well, they won't have his cage
at the wedding, Peg.

05:59.903 --> 06:01.334
Well, you have to admit,

06:01.369 --> 06:03.200
there's one good thing
about my family.

06:03.235 --> 06:05.033
They gave you me.

06:05.068 --> 06:07.334
Getting me sentimental
ain't gonna work with me, Peg.

06:07.369 --> 06:08.934
Now, you send Harriet
a card,

06:08.969 --> 06:11.100
you give Jose a copy of
the Pledge of Allegiance,

06:11.135 --> 06:13.133
but I'm not going.

06:13.168 --> 06:14.567
Yes, you are.

06:14.602 --> 06:16.000
No, I'm not.

06:16.035 --> 06:18.567
Oh, yes, you are, and you cannot
walk out on this argument.

06:18.602 --> 06:19.634
Watch me.

06:19.669 --> 06:20.901
Fine, but when you come home,

06:20.936 --> 06:22.300
we're picking up
where we left off.

06:22.335 --> 06:25.300
That's fine.
Then I'm not coming home.

06:27.267 --> 06:30.300
Eh, you'll
be coming home,

06:30.335 --> 06:34.267
and Mr. and Mrs. Bundy
will be attending.

06:34.302 --> 06:39.267
* You're once, twice
Three times a lady **

06:39.302 --> 06:40.868
See, I told you.

06:40.903 --> 06:43.267
You can dance
in these shoes.

06:43.302 --> 06:45.767
Well, I'll take them.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.200
Luke, what
are you doing?

06:52.235 --> 06:53.801
Selling shoes, man.

06:53.836 --> 06:56.634
You work on commission,
you go the extra mile,

06:56.669 --> 06:58.834
And that, my friend,
is the extra mile.

07:03.701 --> 07:05.200
Thank you.

07:05.235 --> 07:06.701
My pleasure.

07:06.736 --> 07:10.300
Oh, your son
is very nice.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.200
Yeah, she must have been
something 1,500 years ago.

07:18.801 --> 07:20.334
Get away from me, Luke.

07:20.369 --> 07:22.467
Hey, Al. You know,

07:22.502 --> 07:24.801
there's something
I've learned over the years,

07:24.836 --> 07:27.868
Whenever someone yells at me,
it's not me.

07:27.903 --> 07:29.234
How could it be?

07:29.269 --> 07:30.267
So, what's wrong?

07:30.302 --> 07:33.234
I had a fight
with my wife.

07:33.269 --> 07:34.968
I knew it wasn't me.

07:35.003 --> 07:36.400
How bad was it?

07:36.435 --> 07:39.601
Well, I got pretty mad.
So I laid down the law.

07:39.636 --> 07:41.801
I told her
I'm not coming home!

07:41.836 --> 07:46.501
So, uh...where can I
get some flowers, cheap?

07:46.536 --> 07:49.067
I thought you said
you weren't going home.

07:49.102 --> 07:51.801
Let's face it. I've got
no choice. I have to.

07:51.836 --> 07:53.133
That's the trouble

07:53.168 --> 07:55.300
when you're married
with children.

07:55.335 --> 07:57.067
They know
you're coming home.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.234
Al.

08:00.269 --> 08:01.234
What?

08:02.834 --> 08:05.834
What do you think I should
have for lunch?

08:05.869 --> 08:08.934
Hey, I'm pouring out
my heart here.

08:08.969 --> 08:10.767
I'm sorry.
I thought you were done.

08:10.802 --> 08:12.133
No, I'm not.

08:12.168 --> 08:13.534
I'm not at all.

08:13.569 --> 08:16.400
I gotta find
a place to stay.

08:16.435 --> 08:18.400
I can't afford a hotel.

08:18.435 --> 08:21.133
If I go home,
then I'm saying I'm sorry,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.167
so I can't go home,
I gotta...

08:23.202 --> 08:25.267
make her wonder,
make her...worry,

08:25.302 --> 08:26.734
make her...miss me.

08:26.769 --> 08:29.868
Then I can go home,
so she can yell at me.

08:29.903 --> 08:31.467
Where am I gonna stay?

08:31.502 --> 08:34.267
Everybody comes
to the answer man.

08:34.302 --> 08:36.333
The choice
is obvious, Al.

08:36.369 --> 08:40.333
You set up a cot
in the stock room.

08:40.369 --> 08:43.000
I'm staying
with you, Luke.

08:43.034 --> 08:44.100
For free?

08:44.135 --> 08:45.267
Yes.

08:45.302 --> 08:47.033
You know, I haven't done
something like this

08:47.068 --> 08:48.400
in a long time.

08:48.435 --> 08:51.834
Yeah, kick back with a buddy
and a six-pack and be men.

08:51.869 --> 08:53.601
You know, Luke, I...

08:53.636 --> 08:55.767
This is really helping me out.
Thanks a lot.

08:55.802 --> 08:59.267
Hey, the day Luke Ventura
can't help a friend,

08:59.302 --> 09:02.701
that's the day he's got
something better to do.

09:07.601 --> 09:10.534
<i>The divorce judge
will now render his verdict.</i>

09:10.569 --> 09:14.000
<i>Mr. Gannon, your lovely bride
of eight months</i>

09:14.035 --> 09:16.501
<i>deserves far better
than you.</i>

09:16.536 --> 09:20.100
<i>I can't grant her that,
but I can grant her...</i>

09:20.135 --> 09:23.033
<i>93 percent
of your net worth...</i>

09:23.068 --> 09:26.834
<i>your Ferrari
and your stocks.</i>

09:26.869 --> 09:28.801
<i>And you, Mr. Gannon...</i>

09:28.836 --> 09:32.267
<i>you get the children.</i>

09:32.302 --> 09:35.234
<i>This court is adjourned.</i>

09:35.269 --> 09:36.767
What a great show!

09:36.802 --> 09:39.667
Oh, yeah. You know,
that's a real judge.

09:39.702 --> 09:41.434
More coffee?
Okay.

09:42.901 --> 09:44.200
Listen, Marce,

09:44.235 --> 09:47.100
Al and I have to go out of town
to a wedding next week.

09:47.135 --> 09:49.033
Do you think you
could watch the house?

09:49.068 --> 09:51.234
Sure.
I love weddings.

09:51.269 --> 09:52.934
Where are
they registered?

09:52.969 --> 09:55.968
Department
of Immigration.

09:56.003 --> 09:57.100
How '80s.

09:57.135 --> 09:59.167
Well, if you can't
find anything there,

09:59.202 --> 10:01.300
we have a lot
of good gift catalogues.

10:01.335 --> 10:03.267
Why don't you and Al
come over later?

10:03.302 --> 10:05.634
Better yet,
come over without Al.

10:05.669 --> 10:07.200
I'm afraid I'd have to.

10:07.235 --> 10:08.868
He's mad at me
about the wedding.

10:08.903 --> 10:10.033
We had this big fight.

10:10.068 --> 10:12.000
He was so cute.

10:12.035 --> 10:14.100
He said
he wasn't coming home.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.634
You don't
seem too concerned.

10:16.669 --> 10:20.567
Marcie, this is Al.

10:20.602 --> 10:21.868
I mean, where's
he gonna go?

10:21.903 --> 10:23.667
He might drive around
for a while

10:23.702 --> 10:27.234
till he has to use
the bathroom and eat.

10:27.269 --> 10:29.701
Then he'll come
slinking back,

10:29.736 --> 10:31.667
pretending
nothing happened,

10:31.702 --> 10:34.934
and we'll go to bed,
and nothing will happen.

10:34.969 --> 10:39.067
Well, I'd be worried if Steve
threatened not to come home.

10:39.102 --> 10:42.100
<i>According to my book,
Man and Other Primates,</i>

10:42.135 --> 10:43.534
after a marital spat,

10:43.569 --> 10:47.934
the man is most vulnerable
to outside stimuli.

10:47.969 --> 10:50.400
What does that mean?

10:50.435 --> 10:53.534
There are a lot of man-hungry
barracudas out there.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.834
The first little wink,

10:54.869 --> 10:57.033
his shoes
will be under her bed.

10:57.068 --> 11:00.434
Well, that should
end it right there.

11:03.901 --> 11:07.167
Here it is,
home of the big boy.

11:10.400 --> 11:13.434
I can't believe
you live in a building

11:13.469 --> 11:15.501
where all your neighbors
are stewardesses.

11:15.536 --> 11:18.200
I used to live in a building
with a lot of married people.

11:18.235 --> 11:20.334
Sure, the sex was great
during the day,

11:20.369 --> 11:22.734
but it got lonely
at night.

11:22.769 --> 11:26.100
Take a load off.
Sit down.

11:26.135 --> 11:27.234
No TV?

11:27.269 --> 11:30.534
It's in the bedroom
with the cameras.

11:30.569 --> 11:33.667
You want a drink?

11:33.702 --> 11:36.234
Yeah, uh...
got some scotch?

11:36.269 --> 11:38.133
I got everything.

11:38.168 --> 11:43.067
One of the many benefits
of living in a stew zoo.

11:48.501 --> 11:52.601
You want a deck of cards
or a barf bag or something?

11:52.636 --> 11:54.033
Nah, I'm cool.

11:54.068 --> 11:57.534
Peggy must be
eating her heart out.

11:57.569 --> 11:59.167
If she could see me now.

11:59.202 --> 12:01.067
What a night,
huh, buddy?

12:01.102 --> 12:02.634
I'm gonna kind of
get comfortable.

12:02.669 --> 12:04.133
You make yourself
at home, buddy.

12:04.168 --> 12:05.100
Yeah.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.868
Eat your heart out, Peg.

12:19.834 --> 12:23.868
* By the time
I get to Phoenix *

12:23.903 --> 12:27.200
* She'll be risin' *

12:27.235 --> 12:32.701
* Hmm hmm hmm hmm
Hmm hmm hmm her hair *

12:45.367 --> 12:47.267
Hi.
Hi.

12:47.302 --> 12:48.834
We're the Cherry
sisters.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.501
Terry and Sherry
Cherry.

12:54.601 --> 12:57.634
I'm, uh...
uh...

12:57.669 --> 13:00.601
Al! Al Bundy.
That's right.

13:03.300 --> 13:05.400
Luke!
Luke!

13:05.435 --> 13:06.868
Cherries!

13:09.601 --> 13:11.534
We brought you this.

13:11.569 --> 13:15.334
Our mother taught us never
to go anyplace empty-handed.

13:15.369 --> 13:17.767
Or without a dime
for a phone call.

13:17.802 --> 13:20.968
Oh, we didn't
bring anything for you.

13:21.003 --> 13:23.033
Would you like our dime?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.701
Aren't they sweet, Al?

13:26.736 --> 13:29.400
Uh, Al! Al Bundy.
That's right.

13:32.634 --> 13:35.534
Ladies, I'd like you
to meet my friend,

13:35.569 --> 13:37.667
Al "The King" Bundy.

13:37.702 --> 13:39.667
Let's get
comfortable here.

13:39.702 --> 13:40.901
Come on.

13:40.936 --> 13:42.501
Ooh,
you redecorated.

13:42.536 --> 13:44.067
Oh, I love it.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.667
<i>It's kind of
a Wild Kingdom feel.</i>

13:46.702 --> 13:48.033
I like it.

13:54.200 --> 13:57.067
Luke, you know,
Sherry and I were just talking,

13:57.102 --> 14:00.801
and I really need
a man's opinion.

14:00.836 --> 14:03.100
Okay.
Come sit on my lap.

14:03.135 --> 14:04.267
Sure.

14:09.133 --> 14:11.267
I don't know
what to do.

14:11.302 --> 14:13.100
My boyfriend wants
to move in with me,

14:13.135 --> 14:15.634
but he still wants
to see other people.

14:15.669 --> 14:17.033
Let me tell you something.

14:17.068 --> 14:18.601
You don't let him move in

14:18.636 --> 14:20.634
unless he's willing
to make a commitment.

14:20.669 --> 14:21.801
Thanks, Luke.

14:21.836 --> 14:24.801
So you wanna go
in the bedroom?

14:24.836 --> 14:27.000
Sure, as long as I'm here.

14:29.667 --> 14:32.267
Everyone comes
to the answer man.

14:35.868 --> 14:41.400
* You're once, twice
Three times a lady *

14:41.435 --> 14:43.634
* And I love... *

14:46.234 --> 14:48.167
* You **

15:04.968 --> 15:07.501
So, what do you
do, Al?

15:07.536 --> 15:09.601
Oh, I'm a, I'm a...

15:09.636 --> 15:11.534
You know, a shoe thing.

15:15.234 --> 15:17.601
They're gonna
be in there a while.

15:17.636 --> 15:20.367
Looks like
you're stuck with me.

15:29.402 --> 15:30.601
Hello.

15:30.636 --> 15:32.400
Oh, hi, sis.

15:32.435 --> 15:35.167
Gee, you and Harriet
must really be excited.

15:35.202 --> 15:36.767
Oh, I wanted to tell you

15:36.802 --> 15:39.367
that Al and I
are coming to the wedding.

15:39.402 --> 15:43.667
<i>Well, don't cry.
I have to bring Al.</i>

15:43.702 --> 15:46.534
Jose called off
the wedding?!

15:46.569 --> 15:48.501
Why?

15:48.536 --> 15:50.968
He won the lottery?

15:53.868 --> 15:56.868
Oh, poor Harriet.

15:58.467 --> 15:59.968
Well, I'll tell Al.

16:00.003 --> 16:01.834
He'll just be devastated,

16:01.869 --> 16:04.868
but maybe we'll see you
for Schnitzel Week.

16:04.903 --> 16:06.534
Love you too.

16:08.636 --> 16:09.734
Hi, Kel.

16:09.769 --> 16:10.868
Hi, Mom.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.868
Is Dad
in the bathroom?

16:12.903 --> 16:14.200
No.

16:14.235 --> 16:15.567
If he's not
in the bathroom

16:15.602 --> 16:16.868
and he's not
watching television,

16:16.903 --> 16:18.100
where else
could he be?

16:18.135 --> 16:20.601
I think your father's
working late.

16:20.636 --> 16:23.100
The shoe store
closed hours ago.

16:23.135 --> 16:25.701
You had a fight,
didn't you?

16:25.736 --> 16:28.667
Of course not.
What would we fight about?

16:28.702 --> 16:31.667
The fact that you
have no money

16:31.702 --> 16:34.801
and Bud and I are
great disappointments to you.

16:34.836 --> 16:36.300
You are not
disappointments.

16:36.335 --> 16:39.300
Look, we did have a fight,
but don't worry.

16:39.335 --> 16:41.667
Your father
will be home soon.

16:41.702 --> 16:44.167
Well, I hope
wherever Dad is,

16:44.202 --> 16:47.000
he's nowhere near
another woman.

16:47.035 --> 16:49.400
Mom,
I hate to tell you,

16:49.435 --> 16:51.167
but as a boyfriend
stealer myself,

16:51.202 --> 16:53.734
the best time
to get them

16:53.769 --> 16:55.667
is right
after a fight.

16:55.702 --> 16:58.868
Oh, who would
want your father?

16:58.903 --> 17:00.868
Mom, let me tell you...

17:00.903 --> 17:04.367
When a woman gets
to be around your age,

17:04.402 --> 17:05.901
they get real desperate.

17:09.032 --> 17:11.534
I've seen them
at the mall.

17:11.569 --> 17:14.534
Their hungry, vacant eyes
scanning the escalators,

17:14.569 --> 17:17.534
pretending to shop
near the men's dressing rooms,

17:17.569 --> 17:20.032
praying that
some man, any man,

17:20.068 --> 17:22.032
will walk up and say,

17:22.068 --> 17:26.099
"Does this tie
go with this shirt?"

17:26.135 --> 17:29.033
I don't have
to tell you what's next.

17:30.767 --> 17:32.801
Can I have
Dad's chicken?

17:32.836 --> 17:34.801
Sure, honey. Why don't you
take it upstairs.

17:34.836 --> 17:36.300
Oh, look.
Don't worry about Daddy.

17:36.335 --> 17:37.801
He'll be home soon,

17:37.836 --> 17:40.300
and I know where he is.

17:40.335 --> 17:42.300
He's over at Telly's Bar

17:42.335 --> 17:46.300
having a beer, watching the game
on the big screen,

17:46.335 --> 17:49.167
lying about how many
shoes he's sold.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.567
Hello, Telly?

17:59.602 --> 18:01.601
Is Al Bundy there?

18:03.400 --> 18:05.300
Well, could you
check the bathroom?

18:07.000 --> 18:09.767
So my sister and I
got jobs as stewardesses

18:09.802 --> 18:10.968
because we thought

18:11.003 --> 18:14.601
that's the way
to become pilots.

18:19.767 --> 18:22.767
The reason she's in first class
and I'm in coach

18:22.802 --> 18:25.267
is 'cause she's much
smarter than I am.

18:25.302 --> 18:27.767
One time I went
into the cockpit

18:27.802 --> 18:30.767
and I actually saw her
sitting on the pilot's lap

18:30.802 --> 18:32.767
helping him fly
the plane.

18:32.802 --> 18:34.767
She must have
been very good,

18:34.802 --> 18:37.634
because he told
the copilot to get out.

18:40.868 --> 18:43.801
You know, you have
very strong forearms.

18:43.836 --> 18:44.968
Yeah.

18:45.003 --> 18:47.834
It must be from
all that flushing.

18:49.234 --> 18:51.734
Well, that and,
you know, working out.

18:51.769 --> 18:55.234
Yeah. You know, men are
always making passes at me

18:55.269 --> 18:57.734
because they think
stews are easy,

18:57.769 --> 18:59.234
but we're not.

18:59.269 --> 19:00.701
Oh, Luke!

19:00.736 --> 19:03.400
Luke, Luke!

19:03.435 --> 19:05.267
He's not
out here, sis!

19:14.367 --> 19:16.367
Let me ask you
something, Al.

19:16.402 --> 19:19.968
What does a nice guy
look for in a girl?

19:20.003 --> 19:22.300
Uh...you.

19:23.467 --> 19:24.968
Really.
You're beautiful,

19:25.003 --> 19:26.467
and you're blond,

19:26.502 --> 19:27.767
and, uh...

19:27.802 --> 19:30.133
you're facing me.

19:32.267 --> 19:34.767
I like that in a woman.

19:34.802 --> 19:37.300
Don't worry. The right guy
is going to come along.

19:37.335 --> 19:39.367
You know, I really feel
comfortable with you,

19:39.402 --> 19:42.801
like I can talk to you
and be myself.

19:42.836 --> 19:44.267
I don't have to live up

19:44.302 --> 19:46.133
to any of those
stereotyped expectations

19:46.168 --> 19:47.601
everyone has
of a stewardess.

19:47.636 --> 19:49.300
You know,
always waiting on people,

19:49.335 --> 19:50.634
attending to their needs.

19:50.669 --> 19:52.734
Would you care
for a beverage?

19:52.769 --> 19:53.901
No, thanks.

19:53.936 --> 19:56.300
I'm looking for
a serious commitment,

19:56.335 --> 19:58.000
Someone who'll
stay the night.

20:02.400 --> 20:05.167
Then I gotta think there's
some guy out there for you.

20:05.202 --> 20:07.300
I hope so.

20:07.335 --> 20:09.434
See, I'm not like
my sister.

20:09.469 --> 20:11.734
I need a man
to make me whole.

20:11.769 --> 20:12.801
Ooh...

20:17.734 --> 20:21.267
Well, I think
I'd better get going.

20:21.302 --> 20:23.434
You want a massage?

20:23.469 --> 20:24.634
Sure.

20:28.100 --> 20:30.100
Ooh, you're tense.

20:30.135 --> 20:33.100
And there are
tears in my eyes.

20:33.135 --> 20:36.434
Well, I better
get going home.

20:36.469 --> 20:38.434
Can I come with you?

20:38.469 --> 20:41.300
What are my chances
Peg's in a coma?

20:43.267 --> 20:44.501
No.

20:44.536 --> 20:48.000
Listen, I know that
I'm in a bachelor's pad,

20:48.035 --> 20:51.434
and that I've got
the forearms of a Java man,

20:51.469 --> 20:53.968
but I gotta tell you...

20:54.003 --> 20:55.734
I'm married...

20:55.769 --> 20:57.567
with children.

20:57.602 --> 20:58.767
That's okay.

21:00.734 --> 21:01.767
Excuse me.

21:08.934 --> 21:10.934
Uh, listen, you're
really, really great,

21:10.969 --> 21:13.934
and any guy would be lucky

21:13.969 --> 21:16.133
I mean, jackpot lucky,
to be with you,

21:16.168 --> 21:17.834
but I hope
you'll understand.

21:17.869 --> 21:19.434
See, I've been married
a long time,

21:19.469 --> 21:21.434
and it just
wouldn't be right.

21:21.469 --> 21:23.934
You got any pictures
of yourself?

21:26.434 --> 21:29.434
No. No, that wouldn't
be right either.

21:29.469 --> 21:31.434
Listen, I gotta go.

21:31.469 --> 21:32.667
Take care.

21:32.702 --> 21:34.667
You are so honorable.

21:34.702 --> 21:38.334
Your wife must be
really wonderful.

21:38.369 --> 21:40.133
Well, she's a pip...

21:42.434 --> 21:44.067
But she's my pip.

21:45.934 --> 21:47.501
Hey, guys.

21:47.536 --> 21:49.567
You wanna make a movie?

21:50.701 --> 21:52.400
Yes, I do.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.234
Goodbye.

21:57.701 --> 21:59.100
Yes, I do.

22:19.200 --> 22:20.701
Oh, gee, Al,

22:20.736 --> 22:22.467
I'm so glad you're home.

22:25.067 --> 22:26.267
Wear this.
