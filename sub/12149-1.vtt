00:03.129 --> 00:04.459
Los Angeles,

00:04.929 --> 00:07.280
You see it at night and it shines,
A beacon,

00:09.130 --> 00:11.060
People are drawn to it,
People...

00:11.529 --> 00:12.330
...and other things,

00:13.330 --> 00:15.470
They come for all sorts of reasons,
My reason?

00:16.329 --> 00:17.559
No surprise there,

00:18.129 --> 00:19.570
It started with a girl,

00:19.929 --> 00:22.070
She was a really, really pretty girl.

00:22.929 --> 00:24.050
No, I mean....

00:24.730 --> 00:26.589
She was a hottie girl.

00:27.129 --> 00:28.570
She had....

00:28.929 --> 00:30.510
I mean, her hair...

00:31.329 --> 00:32.340
...was....

00:33.729 --> 00:34.710
You know?

00:36.130 --> 00:38.159
You kind of remind me of her.

00:39.729 --> 00:41.689
Because....
Because, you know, the hair.

00:43.329 --> 00:45.149
I mean, you both have hair.

00:49.329 --> 00:50.979
A shark! Oh!

00:52.000 --> 00:58.074

01:00.130 --> 01:02.020
- We want to cash out.
- Yeah, sure.

01:03.729 --> 01:04.849
Girls are nice.

01:07.930 --> 01:09.159
Here you go, pal.

01:09.730 --> 01:10.569
Thank you.

01:16.329 --> 01:17.200
Come on, let's go.

01:18.129 --> 01:19.989
Let's go find some real fun.

01:34.930 --> 01:36.400
You really know the doorman?

01:36.730 --> 01:38.379
You can get us into Lido?

01:39.129 --> 01:40.569
I don't want to go clubbing.

01:40.930 --> 01:42.370
I want to party right here.

01:42.730 --> 01:44.129
Hey, back off!

01:45.730 --> 01:46.989
Shut up and die.

01:49.329 --> 01:50.909
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:52.329 --> 01:53.489
I'm sorry.

01:55.329 --> 01:57.010
Anyone seen my car?

01:57.129 --> 01:59.129
It's big and shiny.

02:00.129 --> 02:01.000
Piss off, pal.

02:10.330 --> 02:11.409
Breath mint?

02:37.930 --> 02:39.539
You shouldn't have done that.

02:50.530 --> 02:51.229
Oh, my God.

02:52.330 --> 02:53.030
They were....

02:53.530 --> 02:54.580
Go home.

02:55.330 --> 02:56.520
Thank you.

02:58.930 --> 03:00.300
Get away from me.

05:07.250 --> 05:08.050
I like the place.

05:09.050 --> 05:10.129
Not much of a view...

05:10.250 --> 05:12.990
...but it's got a nice "Bat Cave"
sort of air to it.

05:13.850 --> 05:14.970
Who are you?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.259
Doyle.

05:18.649 --> 05:21.000
- You don't smell human.
- That's a bit rude.

05:21.649 --> 05:23.750
As it happens,
I'm very much human.

05:28.850 --> 05:29.829
On my mother's side.

05:31.850 --> 05:34.240
I come uninvited, so you know
I'm not a vampire like you.

05:34.850 --> 05:35.930
What do you want?

05:36.649 --> 05:37.980
I've been sent.

05:39.050 --> 05:41.579
- By the powers that be.
- Powers that be what?

05:42.649 --> 05:45.110
Let me tell you
a little bedtime story.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.810
But I'm not sleepy.

05:48.050 --> 05:50.050
Once upon a time,
there was a vampire.

05:50.449 --> 05:52.939
He was the meanest vampire
in all the land.

05:57.649 --> 06:00.110
Other vampires were afraid
of him. He was such a...

06:00.649 --> 06:01.699
...bastard.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.699
Then one day, he's cursed.
By gypsies.

06:07.850 --> 06:09.250
They restore his human soul.

06:10.850 --> 06:12.529
Suddenly, he's mad with guilt.

06:12.649 --> 06:13.660
"What have I done?"

06:14.449 --> 06:15.319
He's freaked.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.089
Okay...

06:17.449 --> 06:18.850
...now I'm sleepy.

06:19.250 --> 06:21.000
Well, it's a fairly dull tale.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.300
I feel it needs a little sex.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.009
So, sure enough, enter the girl.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.990
Pretty little blond thing.
Vampire slayer by trade.

06:32.449 --> 06:35.399
Our vampire falls madly
in love with her.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.790
Eventually, the two of them
get fleshy with one another.

06:39.050 --> 06:39.959
The moment he--

06:41.449 --> 06:44.189
I guess the technical term is
"Perfect Happiness."

06:45.649 --> 06:47.189
But when our boy gets there...

06:47.449 --> 06:49.129
...he goes bad.
He kills again.

06:50.449 --> 06:51.149
It's ugly.

06:51.649 --> 06:54.139
When he gets his soul back
for the second time...

06:54.649 --> 06:56.720
...he figures he can't be near her...

06:57.050 --> 06:59.790
...without endangering them both.
What does he do?

07:01.250 --> 07:02.329
He takes off.

07:03.050 --> 07:04.100
Goes to L.A...

07:07.250 --> 07:09.920
...to fight evil,
and atone for his crimes.

07:12.050 --> 07:13.420
He's a shadow.

07:16.250 --> 07:19.439
A faceless champion
of the hapless human race.

07:21.050 --> 07:23.370
You wouldn't have a beer
in here, would you?

07:24.050 --> 07:24.819
No.

07:25.850 --> 07:27.949
You must have something
besides pig's blood.

07:28.250 --> 07:30.529
You've told me the story
of my life, which since...

07:31.250 --> 07:33.500
...I was there, I already knew.

07:34.850 --> 07:36.430
Why aren't I kicking you out?

07:37.250 --> 07:39.250
Now I'm gonna tell you
what happens next.

07:40.850 --> 07:42.670
This vampire, he thinks he's helping.

07:43.250 --> 07:44.720
Fighting the demons.

07:45.050 --> 07:47.120
Staying away from humans
to avoid temptation.

07:47.449 --> 07:50.120
Doing penance in his little cell.

07:51.649 --> 07:53.089
But he's cut off...

07:54.649 --> 07:55.879
...from everything.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.939
From the people he's trying to help.

08:00.050 --> 08:01.379
I still save them.

08:01.850 --> 08:03.850
Who cares if I
don't stop to chat?

08:05.449 --> 08:07.449
When was the last time
you drank blood?

08:07.850 --> 08:08.649
Buffy.

08:09.050 --> 08:10.769
Left you with a bit of a craving.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.149
Let me tell you something.
That craving's gonna grow.

08:14.449 --> 08:17.430
One day, one of those helpless
victims you don't care about...

08:18.050 --> 08:20.189
...will look too
appetizing to turn down.

08:21.050 --> 08:24.029
And you'll figure, "What's one
against all I've saved?

08:24.649 --> 08:27.560
Might as well eat them.
I'm still ahead by the numbers."

08:30.649 --> 08:34.759
I'm parched from this yakking, man.
Let's go treat me to a Billy Dee.

08:36.450 --> 08:38.590
It's not about fighting
and gadgets and such.

08:39.450 --> 08:42.779
It's about reaching out. Showing them
that there's love and hope.

08:43.049 --> 08:44.940
- Spare change?
- Get a job, you lazy sow.

08:45.450 --> 08:47.409
It's about letting them
in your heart.

08:48.450 --> 08:50.730
It's not just saving lives,
it's saving souls.

08:50.850 --> 08:53.519
Hey! Possibly your own
in the process.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.100
I want to know who sent you.

08:56.250 --> 08:58.039
I'm honestly not sure who sent me.

08:58.649 --> 09:00.120
They don't speak to me direct.

09:00.450 --> 09:01.149
I get...

09:01.649 --> 09:02.559
...visions.

09:02.850 --> 09:05.549
Great splitting migraines
that come with pictures.

09:06.450 --> 09:08.029
A name, a face.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.620
I don't know who sends them.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.009
Whoever sends them
is more powerful than us.

09:12.450 --> 09:14.769
- They're trying to make things right.
- Why me?

09:15.450 --> 09:16.529
You got potential.

09:16.649 --> 09:19.669
- The balance sheet ain't in your favor.
- Why you?

09:22.649 --> 09:24.509
We all got something to atone for.

09:26.850 --> 09:28.429
Had a vision this morning.

09:29.250 --> 09:31.990
When the blinding pain stopped,
I wrote this down.

09:34.049 --> 09:34.750
Tina?

09:35.250 --> 09:36.409
Pretty girl. Needs help.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.250
Help with what?

09:37.649 --> 09:39.789
That's your business.
I just take the names.

09:40.049 --> 09:43.100
- I don't get it. How am I supposed--?
- Get into her life, remember?

09:44.250 --> 09:45.120
Get involved.

09:45.450 --> 09:47.340
Look, high school's over, bud.

09:47.850 --> 09:49.809
You gotta make with the
grown-up talk now.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.519
Why would a woman I've never met
talk to me?

09:54.450 --> 09:56.549
Have you looked
in the mirror lately?

09:58.049 --> 10:00.149
No, I guess you really haven't.

10:03.450 --> 10:04.889
I'm not good with people.

10:07.049 --> 10:10.169
That's the whole point of this
little exercise, isn't it?

10:12.450 --> 10:13.429
Are you game?

10:31.049 --> 10:34.309
Tina, I gotta do it by seniority.
Everyone wants to work extra hours.

10:35.250 --> 10:37.070
It's just....
I just need....

10:37.649 --> 10:40.250
I'm good for Saturday nights.
If people want to go out...

10:40.649 --> 10:42.120
...I'll double-shift, whatever.

10:42.450 --> 10:44.480
You're on the list, okay?

10:45.450 --> 10:46.389
Thanks.

10:53.250 --> 10:54.370
Sure is a cute...

10:55.049 --> 10:56.059
...doggy.

11:01.649 --> 11:03.049
So, do you...?

11:03.450 --> 11:04.529
How late are you open?

11:04.649 --> 11:05.490
You talking to me?

11:08.850 --> 11:09.580
Wow!

11:11.250 --> 11:12.649
Good reflexes.

11:14.850 --> 11:16.850
Thanks. These come
out of my paycheck.

11:19.649 --> 11:20.490
So...

11:20.850 --> 11:21.720
...are you...

11:23.250 --> 11:24.440
...happy?

11:24.450 --> 11:25.250
What?

11:26.850 --> 11:28.570
You looked sort of down.

11:28.649 --> 11:29.700
You been watching me?

11:30.450 --> 11:31.360
No, I just....

11:31.649 --> 11:33.679
I was looking towards there...

11:35.250 --> 11:36.649
...and you walked...

11:37.049 --> 11:38.210
...through there.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.350
You don't hit on girls
very often, do you?

11:42.450 --> 11:43.679
It's been a while.

11:44.250 --> 11:46.039
I'm sort of new in town.

11:47.250 --> 11:49.419
Do yourself a favor.
Don't stay.

11:51.450 --> 11:52.919
You never answered my question.

11:54.450 --> 11:56.450
Am I happy?
You got three hours?

11:56.850 --> 11:57.759
Do I look busy?

12:04.049 --> 12:05.490
I get off at 10.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.159
I suddenly feel underdressed.

12:15.450 --> 12:16.610
Did you want a drink?

12:17.250 --> 12:19.320
I know who you are,
what you're doing here.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.990
Stay away from me.
Tell Russell to leave me alone.

12:23.250 --> 12:24.230
I don't know any Russell.

12:24.450 --> 12:25.889
- You're lying.
- No, I'm not.

12:26.850 --> 12:29.309
- Why were you watching me?
- Because you looked lonely.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.870
I figured then we have
something in common.

12:41.850 --> 12:42.620
Oh....

12:43.649 --> 12:44.730
I'm sorry.

12:46.049 --> 12:47.309
- I'm really--
- It's okay.

12:47.850 --> 12:48.720
No, it's not.

12:49.649 --> 12:51.470
I'm sort of having
relationship issues.

12:52.649 --> 12:53.700
Who's Russell?

12:58.049 --> 12:59.450
I'd like to help.

12:59.850 --> 13:02.129
Only help I need is a ticket home.

13:02.850 --> 13:05.200
And that wasn't me
asking for money.

13:07.049 --> 13:08.029
Where's home?

13:08.250 --> 13:09.929
Missoula, Montana.

13:10.649 --> 13:12.750
- You've been there?
- During the Depression.

13:14.850 --> 13:16.250
My depression.

13:16.649 --> 13:17.769
I was depressed there.

13:18.450 --> 13:19.820
- But it's pretty.
- Yeah.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.580
Lots of open land.

13:22.049 --> 13:23.350
Lots of nothing else.

13:25.049 --> 13:27.149
I came here to be
a famous movie star...

13:28.649 --> 13:30.049
...but they weren't hiring.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.860
Well, I have a fabulous...

13:34.649 --> 13:36.259
...Hollywood party to go to.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.309
Hence the glamour.

13:38.850 --> 13:41.730
Girl giving it owes me
my security deposit.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.039
It was nice threatening you.

13:47.250 --> 13:48.549
You need a lift?

13:59.649 --> 14:01.929
Tina! Smile for the camera.

14:03.250 --> 14:05.639
Who is this hunk of tall,
dark and handsome?

14:06.250 --> 14:07.549
Just a friend.

14:08.049 --> 14:09.940
Margo, I really need to
talk to you.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.870
Grab yourself a drink,
I'll be right there.

14:21.850 --> 14:22.549
Cute.

14:23.049 --> 14:23.960
Everyone's a star.

14:25.450 --> 14:26.460
Who's Russell?

14:27.250 --> 14:29.279
Someone I made
the mistake of trusting.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.220
Here I am.

14:33.250 --> 14:36.620
- This won't take long.
- I wouldn't leave that one unattended.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.340
You are a beautiful, beautiful man.

14:46.450 --> 14:48.029
- Thanks.
- You're an actor.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.899
- No.
- That wasn't a question.

14:50.649 --> 14:51.659
I'm Oliver.

14:51.850 --> 14:54.799
Ask anyone about Oliver,
they'll tell you I'm a fierce animal.

14:55.450 --> 14:57.240
I'm your manager as soon as you call.

14:58.450 --> 14:59.389
I'm not an actor.

14:59.649 --> 15:01.929
I like the humor.
I like the whole thing.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.899
Call me. This isn't a come-on.

15:05.049 --> 15:07.889
I'm in a serious relationship
with a landscape architect.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.919
You know, they asked me to
come and read a third time.

15:21.850 --> 15:24.240
I'm an actress! I don't put up
with things like that.

15:24.850 --> 15:25.549
Cordelia?

15:28.450 --> 15:30.480
Oh, my God! Angel?

15:31.450 --> 15:32.610
Nice to see a familiar face.

15:33.250 --> 15:34.860
Are you living here?

15:35.049 --> 15:36.309
Yeah. You?

15:36.850 --> 15:37.789
Malibu.

15:38.049 --> 15:39.700
A condo.
Not on a private beach...

15:40.450 --> 15:42.169
...but I'm young, so I forbear.

15:42.250 --> 15:43.120
And you're acting?

15:43.450 --> 15:44.250
Can you believe it?

15:44.649 --> 15:46.789
I just started it
to make some quick cash...

15:47.649 --> 15:49.970
...and then, boom.
It was like, my life.

15:51.250 --> 15:51.950
So...

15:52.450 --> 15:53.889
...are you still...?

15:55.450 --> 15:56.250
Yeah.

15:56.649 --> 15:58.470
There's not actually
a cure for that.

15:59.649 --> 16:00.629
Right.

16:01.450 --> 16:02.850
But you're not evil?

16:03.250 --> 16:04.620
You're not here to...

16:05.049 --> 16:05.820
...bite people?

16:06.250 --> 16:07.720
No, I gave a friend a ride.

16:08.049 --> 16:08.990
Oh, good.

16:10.450 --> 16:14.309
I better get mingly. I really should
talk to people that are somebody.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.370
But it was fun!

16:18.850 --> 16:20.950
It's nice that she's grown
as a person.

16:53.649 --> 16:55.330
She doesn't have the money yet.

16:56.649 --> 16:57.519
Who's that?

16:59.049 --> 17:00.129
Stacy.

17:01.450 --> 17:02.850
He's just a creep.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.358
Can we please go?

17:05.650 --> 17:06.730
Yeah.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.170
He wants to see you, that's all.

17:24.848 --> 17:27.549
Okay. Okay, no problem.

17:54.529 --> 17:55.440
Damn it!

18:28.730 --> 18:30.730
I don't know you.
Don't get involved.

18:31.730 --> 18:33.269
Tina, get in the car.

18:34.130 --> 18:35.430
You know what?

18:35.930 --> 18:37.329
You're not gonna shoot.

18:40.730 --> 18:41.670
Good call.

18:46.130 --> 18:47.599
Nice party, huh?

18:47.930 --> 18:49.369
A little too fabulous for me.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.859
You have one new message,

18:53.930 --> 18:55.650
Cordy, it's Joe at the agency,

18:56.329 --> 18:57.339
No luck, again,

18:58.130 --> 19:01.500
Having trouble booking auditions,
Networks say they've seen enough,

19:01.730 --> 19:04.779
No need to call, I'll buzz you
if something changes, Bye,

19:06.529 --> 19:08.700
You have no more messages,

19:17.329 --> 19:18.589
My Girl Scout training.

19:19.130 --> 19:21.869
I can live out of this bag
for days if I have to.

19:22.730 --> 19:23.640
I made some tea.

19:24.529 --> 19:25.329
Thanks.

19:25.730 --> 19:27.589
- Do you take milk and sugar?
- Yeah.

19:28.730 --> 19:30.519
Because I don't have those things.

19:32.930 --> 19:34.650
I don't get a lot of visitors.

19:35.930 --> 19:37.470
At least not ones you like.

19:37.730 --> 19:39.339
I have relationship issues too.

19:46.130 --> 19:48.549
I guess this is the part
where you comfort me.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.170
Not like you didn't earn it.

19:52.130 --> 19:53.210
No.

19:54.529 --> 19:57.160
This is the part where you
have a safe place to stay.

19:59.329 --> 20:00.380
You don't want--

20:01.130 --> 20:03.380
You have enough people
taking advantage.

20:04.130 --> 20:06.230
Boy, are you ever
in the wrong town....

20:18.529 --> 20:19.759
Thanks.

20:23.930 --> 20:25.680
Did Russell have a last name?

20:26.930 --> 20:28.509
You don't need to know it.

20:28.730 --> 20:30.549
You've done enough already.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.980
This is L.A. Guys like him
get away with murder.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.069
Who did he murder?

20:38.329 --> 20:40.150
I don't know. Maybe nobody.

20:43.730 --> 20:44.670
He likes....

20:46.730 --> 20:48.380
He likes pain.

20:49.130 --> 20:50.779
I mean, he really does.

20:52.130 --> 20:54.589
He talks about it
like it's a friend of his.

20:55.730 --> 20:57.170
And you don't leave him.

20:57.529 --> 20:59.559
He tells you when he's had enough.

21:01.730 --> 21:03.380
I knew this girl, Denise.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.339
She tried to get away.

21:07.130 --> 21:09.619
She disappeared off the face
of the earth.

21:12.529 --> 21:14.000
He finds you.

21:17.930 --> 21:19.299
Not anymore.

22:24.809 --> 22:27.269
No! No!

22:32.609 --> 22:34.329
- Tina.
- No! No!

22:38.009 --> 22:39.200
It's all right.

22:39.809 --> 22:41.279
He was here.

22:43.410 --> 22:44.490
I'm here.

22:48.210 --> 22:49.289
Easy....

22:51.210 --> 22:53.529
Did Denise have
a tattoo on her left shoulder?

22:55.410 --> 22:56.710
She had a rose.

22:57.809 --> 22:59.319
I think she was murdered.

23:01.410 --> 23:04.599
There've been others.
He picks girls with no one to care.

23:10.410 --> 23:13.039
You don't have to be afraid.
Look, you're safe here.

23:14.009 --> 23:14.990
Why do you have that?

23:20.009 --> 23:22.470
You knew who I was when you
walked in there last night.

23:23.009 --> 23:24.730
No, I didn't. Look, I just--

23:26.009 --> 23:27.660
I had your name. It's complicated.

23:28.410 --> 23:31.849
I'm sure. Big complicated game
that Russell is playing with my head.

23:32.609 --> 23:34.569
- What's he paying you?
- He's not.

23:35.009 --> 23:36.170
You're just like him!

23:38.009 --> 23:39.450
You stay away from me.

23:46.410 --> 23:47.569
Please, listen to me.

24:27.410 --> 24:28.880
Russell.

24:29.210 --> 24:33.140
I've been looking everywhere for you.
And here you are right under my nose.

24:35.210 --> 24:38.470
Oh, I own the building.
Most of the block.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.470
Are you gonna point that
at me all day?

24:44.210 --> 24:45.509
What did you do to Denise?

24:47.210 --> 24:49.099
- Nothing.
- I want the truth, Russell.

24:50.210 --> 24:52.599
She wanted to go home.
I bought her a ticket to Pensacola.

24:55.009 --> 24:56.130
She's dead.

24:56.210 --> 24:59.049
What do you mean?
She called me yesterday.

24:59.809 --> 25:02.690
She's thinking of going
back to school, wanted my help.

25:05.809 --> 25:08.480
Look, we both know
I live outside the box...

25:08.809 --> 25:10.700
...but I don't go around
killing my friends.

25:14.210 --> 25:17.160
If you're sick of L.A.,
if you need rent....

25:20.809 --> 25:22.910
You know, I only want to help you.

25:24.410 --> 25:26.200
Just tell me what you want.

25:27.410 --> 25:28.950
I want to go home.

25:29.809 --> 25:30.680
Done.

25:33.410 --> 25:36.960
Poor thing. Who's been spinning
your head like this?

25:38.809 --> 25:40.950
I don't know, I thought you hired him.

25:41.809 --> 25:43.039
He turned into something.

25:46.009 --> 25:48.039
It was the most horrible thing
I've ever seen.

25:49.009 --> 25:51.289
Well, you're young.

26:45.690 --> 26:47.369
The guy was called Stacy.

26:47.490 --> 26:48.359
First name or last?

26:49.289 --> 26:51.039
I don't know.
Probably done some time.

26:51.089 --> 26:52.250
- I can ask around.
- Great.

26:52.890 --> 26:56.440
Gray '87 Mercedes 300E. Gonna need
some serious work on the bumper.

26:57.089 --> 26:59.410
- Call the chop shops.
- I know a couple.

27:00.089 --> 27:02.339
He leads me to Stacy,
Stacy leads me to Russell.

27:03.690 --> 27:05.339
You couldn't have known she'd run.

27:06.089 --> 27:07.279
Let's get to work.

27:07.890 --> 27:09.819
- You can't cut yourself off--
- Doyle.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.539
I don't want to share my feelings.

27:12.690 --> 27:13.920
I don't want to open up.

27:14.490 --> 27:16.809
I want to find the guy that killed
Tina and look him in the eye.

27:18.089 --> 27:19.250
Then what?

27:19.890 --> 27:21.500
Then I'm gonna share my feelings.

27:28.289 --> 27:30.609
Mr. Winters, the Eltron merger
is a go.

27:31.289 --> 27:33.710
They caved on everything after you...

27:34.289 --> 27:36.039
...negotiated with their CFO.

27:36.089 --> 27:37.980
We'll bring the papers by tomorrow.

27:43.890 --> 27:45.819
She had something, didn't she?

27:52.289 --> 27:54.009
I was sorry to kill her so soon.

27:54.690 --> 27:57.430
Actually, you haven't seen her
in several weeks.

27:58.890 --> 28:02.009
You were in conference yesterday when
the unfortunate incident occurred.

28:02.490 --> 28:06.140
We've located a witness who says
he saw a dark-complected man there.

28:06.690 --> 28:08.019
Impressive.

28:09.690 --> 28:12.460
Wolfram and Hart is a full-service
law firm, Mr. Winters.

28:13.289 --> 28:16.410
It's our job to make sure that our
clients' lives run more smoothly.

28:19.890 --> 28:20.940
Who is this?

28:24.690 --> 28:28.309
Fresh face. I think we should meet.

28:30.089 --> 28:33.990
Should I alert the firm that she may
constitute a long-term investment?

28:35.490 --> 28:37.170
I don't think so.

28:37.890 --> 28:39.500
I just want something to eat.

28:47.490 --> 28:48.890
Where does he live?

28:49.289 --> 28:51.500
Whatever she was to you,
you better forget it.

28:52.289 --> 28:53.799
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

28:54.089 --> 28:55.559
Russell? Let me guess.

28:55.890 --> 28:58.450
Not big on the daylight or mirrors.
Drinks V8.

28:58.890 --> 29:02.119
You get in his way, he'll kill you
and everyone you care about.

29:03.089 --> 29:04.880
There's nobody left I care about.

29:06.490 --> 29:08.630
"I am somebody.

29:10.089 --> 29:11.950
I matter.

29:12.490 --> 29:16.950
People will be attracted to my positive
energy and help me achieve my goals.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.880
I am right where I'm supposed to be..."

29:21.490 --> 29:23.630
...and not dying for something to eat!

29:28.690 --> 29:30.339
Hello. Cordelia Chase.

29:31.089 --> 29:35.230
Cor, it's Margo.
You were such a hit at my party.

29:35.890 --> 29:37.289
Oh, thanks.

29:37.690 --> 29:40.319
Well, guess who saw my videotape
of the party...

29:41.289 --> 29:42.799
...and guess who wants to meet you.

29:43.089 --> 29:47.059
A director? A manager? An assistant
to an assistant who wants lunch?

29:49.089 --> 29:50.420
Russell Winters.

29:50.890 --> 29:51.900
The investment guy?

29:52.089 --> 29:54.970
Oh, Cordelia.
He is a lot more than that.

29:55.690 --> 29:57.829
He helps people get started
in their careers.

29:58.690 --> 30:02.940
He knows everyone,
and he wants to meet you tonight.

30:03.490 --> 30:04.289
Tonight?

30:04.690 --> 30:06.410
He'll send a limo for you at 8.

30:11.890 --> 30:13.609
You're really going to war here.

30:14.289 --> 30:15.799
I guess you've seen a few.

30:16.089 --> 30:18.410
Fourteen. Not including Vietnam.

30:19.089 --> 30:20.740
They never declared it.

30:30.490 --> 30:32.420
"People will be attracted to my
positive energy...

30:32.890 --> 30:35.700
...and help me achieve my goals."
Oh, yeah.

30:41.289 --> 30:42.410
Best of luck to you.

30:43.089 --> 30:46.140
I got money on the Vikings tonight,
but I'll be there in spirit.

30:46.690 --> 30:47.849
You're driving.

30:48.490 --> 30:51.329
Wait a minute. No, no.
I'm not combat ready, man.

30:52.089 --> 30:54.480
- I'm just a messenger.
- And I'm the message.

31:10.089 --> 31:12.369
I'm Russell.
Thank you so much for coming.

31:13.690 --> 31:15.369
That'll be all, Franklin.

31:16.089 --> 31:17.279
We'd like to be alone.

31:19.569 --> 31:23.150
Wow. What a nice place.
I love your curtains.

31:25.569 --> 31:27.460
Not afraid to emphasize the curtains.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.390
I have old-fashioned tastes.

31:30.970 --> 31:32.130
I grew up in a nice home.

31:32.769 --> 31:36.670
It wasn't like this, but we had rooms
that we didn't know what were for.

31:36.970 --> 31:40.480
Till the IRS got all huffy about
my folks not paying their taxes...

31:41.170 --> 31:42.960
...for, well, ever.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.079
They took it all.

31:46.569 --> 31:48.150
Margo tells me you're an actress.

31:48.369 --> 31:50.230
- That's going well?
- Oh.

31:51.369 --> 31:54.390
Yeah, it's great.
I've had a lot of opportunities.

31:54.970 --> 31:58.690
The hands in the LiquiGel commercial
were almost mine by a few girls...

31:59.170 --> 32:01.559
...and, well....

32:05.769 --> 32:07.700
It's not everything I....

32:18.970 --> 32:20.130
How you doing?

32:21.369 --> 32:24.390
I think we're lost.
We're looking for Roscomere.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.240
Hey, what are you watching there?
Is that the game?

32:32.769 --> 32:33.930
Tie him up.

32:33.970 --> 32:36.180
I'm out in 10 minutes
or I'm not coming out.

32:45.970 --> 32:48.640
I've tried really hard, you know?

32:49.569 --> 32:52.940
Usually when I set out to do something
I succeed at it right away.

32:54.970 --> 32:57.359
But I don't know anybody...

32:57.970 --> 33:00.740
...and I don't really
have any friends here.

33:00.970 --> 33:01.880
Now you know me.

33:03.970 --> 33:05.549
And you don't have to worry anymore.

33:09.369 --> 33:11.049
What do you want me to do?

33:14.170 --> 33:16.240
Just tell me what you want.

33:20.769 --> 33:23.609
Oh, God, I'm sorry. I'm getting
all weepy in front of you.

33:24.369 --> 33:27.000
I probably look really scary.

33:27.970 --> 33:29.930
I finally get invited
to a nice place...

33:30.369 --> 33:32.049
...with no mirrors...

33:33.369 --> 33:35.170
...and lots of curtains.

33:35.170 --> 33:36.470
Hey, you're a vampire.

33:36.970 --> 33:40.130
- What? No, I'm not.
- Are too.

33:41.170 --> 33:42.500
I don't know what you mean.

33:42.970 --> 33:46.019
I'm from Sunnydale, we had
a hellmouth. I know a vampire...

33:46.569 --> 33:48.990
...when I'm alone with him
in his fortress-like home.

33:49.569 --> 33:52.269
I'm just feeling a little
lightheaded from hunger.

33:52.569 --> 33:54.849
I'm just wacky and kidding.

34:11.570 --> 34:13.599
Truth is, I'm glad you know.

34:15.768 --> 34:17.000
We can skip the formalities.

34:44.570 --> 34:45.510
Russell Winters.

34:49.369 --> 34:50.280
Angel?

34:50.570 --> 34:52.360
I have a message...

34:52.969 --> 34:54.230
...from Tina.

34:55.369 --> 34:57.900
You've made a very big mistake,
coming here.

34:58.969 --> 35:00.900
You don't know who he is, do you?

35:01.969 --> 35:05.130
Oh, boy, you're about
to get your ass kicked!

35:24.769 --> 35:26.070
Angel!

35:31.369 --> 35:32.099
Kill them!

35:38.570 --> 35:39.690
Angel!

35:45.769 --> 35:47.449
That's it. I'm gone.

35:55.969 --> 35:57.050
Damn it!

36:12.170 --> 36:13.429
It's a good gate.

36:16.369 --> 36:19.559
I had a little bit
of an accident. We'll talk later.

36:29.570 --> 36:31.079
- Got it!
- Finally.

36:31.969 --> 36:34.139
I thought I'd faint while barfing.

36:35.570 --> 36:38.690
Sorry. Okay, so it's over, right?

36:39.769 --> 36:43.139
We're gonna be okay. You put
the fear of God in that Russell guy.

36:43.969 --> 36:47.059
He's not gonna come looking
for me, right?

37:00.969 --> 37:03.530
The Eltron mutual trust binder
is ready for your signature.

37:04.570 --> 37:08.219
Local authorities have no information
on the intruder from last night.

37:08.769 --> 37:12.280
However, we do have several
top private investigators that--

37:15.369 --> 37:16.880
--are looking into his whereabouts.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.269
I believe we've located him.

37:19.570 --> 37:20.829
I'm with Wolfram and Hart.

37:21.369 --> 37:23.510
Mr. Winters has never been accused...

37:23.769 --> 37:25.869
...and shall never be
convicted of any crime.

37:26.769 --> 37:27.610
Ever.

37:28.570 --> 37:31.730
If you harass our client, we'll
bring you into the light of day...

37:32.769 --> 37:35.650
...a place, I'm told, that's not
all that healthy for you.

37:38.769 --> 37:39.960
Angel.

37:41.170 --> 37:43.130
We do things a certain way in L.A.

37:43.570 --> 37:44.869
Well, I'm new here.

37:45.969 --> 37:48.000
But you're a civilized man.

37:48.369 --> 37:50.969
We don't have to go around
attacking each other.

37:51.369 --> 37:54.949
Look at me. I pay my taxes,
keep my name out of the paper...

37:56.769 --> 37:58.380
...and I don't make waves.

38:00.369 --> 38:03.110
And in return,
I can do anything I want.

38:05.170 --> 38:06.360
Really?

38:15.369 --> 38:16.559
Can you fly?

38:39.969 --> 38:41.199
Guess not.

38:48.369 --> 38:50.760
Set up an interoffice meeting at 4:00.

38:50.769 --> 38:52.699
It seems we have a new player in town.

38:53.170 --> 38:56.650
There's no need to disturb
the senior partners with this.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.250
Not yet.

39:14.690 --> 39:15.949
Hello?

39:17.090 --> 39:18.139
Hello?

39:27.889 --> 39:29.119
What happened to Russell?

39:29.690 --> 39:31.059
He went into the light.

39:32.690 --> 39:35.110
Yet you don't seem to be
in a celebrating mood.

39:36.889 --> 39:39.980
I killed a vampire.
It didn't help anyone.

39:42.289 --> 39:45.199
You sure? There's a girl
upstairs who's happy as can be.

39:47.090 --> 39:48.070
Oh, my God!

39:51.289 --> 39:52.940
A cockroach. In the corner.

39:53.090 --> 39:55.409
I'd say it's a bantamweight.

39:56.690 --> 39:59.320
Okay, first thing, we need to call
an exterminator.

40:00.289 --> 40:03.099
And a sign painter.
We should have a name on the door.

40:03.889 --> 40:05.639
Okay, I'm confused.

40:05.690 --> 40:07.829
Doyle filled me in
on your little mission.

40:08.690 --> 40:13.260
So if we're going to be helping
people out, maybe a small charge.

40:14.090 --> 40:16.510
A fee.
Something to help pay the rent...

40:17.090 --> 40:18.000
...and my salary.

40:19.489 --> 40:21.880
You need someone to organize things,
and you're not rich...

40:22.489 --> 40:26.000
...Mr. I-was-alive-for-200-years-and-
never-got-an-investment-portfolio.

40:27.289 --> 40:29.250
- You want to charge people?
- Not everybody.

40:29.690 --> 40:32.849
But sooner or later we are gonna have
to help some rich people, right?

40:34.489 --> 40:35.360
Possibly, yeah.

40:36.289 --> 40:38.460
Hand me that box. We should charge...

40:39.289 --> 40:43.119
...based on a case-by-case analysis,
but with me working for a flat fee.

40:44.690 --> 40:49.010
I mean, that is...if you think
you can use me?

41:02.690 --> 41:04.440
Of course, this is just temporary...

41:05.090 --> 41:07.510
...until my inevitable stardom
takes effect.

41:08.090 --> 41:10.860
Good choice. She'll provide
a connection to the world.

41:11.690 --> 41:14.110
She's got a very humanizing influence.

41:14.690 --> 41:16.130
You think she's a hottie.

41:16.489 --> 41:19.190
She's a stiffener, all right.
Can't lie about that.

41:19.489 --> 41:22.050
- But she could use a hand.
- True.

41:23.090 --> 41:25.579
There's a lot of people
in this city need helping.

41:27.889 --> 41:29.289
So I noticed.

41:30.289 --> 41:31.480
You game?

41:46.489 --> 41:47.610
I'm game,

41:48.305 --> 41:54.297
