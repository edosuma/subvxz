Check out the bikini I bought for
my scuba diving date with Dixon.

12:53.750 --> 12:58.754
It goes perfectly with
my new high heel flippers.

12:58.755 --> 13:02.170
Lexi, you can't scuba diving in a
bikini. You have to wear a wetsuit.

13:02.171 --> 13:04.091
Fine.

13:06.072 --> 13:09.724
I didn't mean under your bikini.

13:09.725 --> 13:13.668
I bought this bikini, I'm wearing it.

13:13.669 --> 13:19.569
Now I just have to put my fake
eyelashes on the scuba mask.

[Phone beeping]

13:24.130 --> 13:27.203
Chyna! Lexi has a scuba
diving date with Dixon.

13:27.204 --> 13:28.737
She's in the bathroom getting ready.

13:28.738 --> 13:33.598
That should give you a
three-hour head start!

13:35.926 --> 13:40.546
Hey, Dixon. I'm ready
to go scuba diving!

13:41.883 --> 13:43.821
Scuba diving?

13:43.822 --> 13:45.809
We're bird watching.

13:45.810 --> 13:48.229
Uh... I know.

13:48.230 --> 13:52.094
This is my bird watching outfit.
Anyone can find birds in the sky.

13:52.095 --> 13:55.197
But finding them
underwater, that takes skill.

Where? [Harpoon gun fires]

[Bird screeches]

14:06.194 --> 14:09.314
Never mind, I see it.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.024
Great news, honey. I got the results.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.812
Of our history test? I think I aced it.

14:20.813 --> 14:25.516
Our first President was the
four-headed guy Count Rushmore, right?

14:25.517 --> 14:28.124
I mean the results of the online survey.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.325
Oh, survey? What are you researching?

14:30.326 --> 14:32.383
You. Since we're dating,

14:32.384 --> 14:36.063
I asked a representative cross-section
of Americans what they thought of you.

14:36.064 --> 14:39.022
Don't worry, the feedback
wasn't all negative.

14:39.023 --> 14:44.244
Just in the north, the east, the south, the
midwest, the northwest, and the southwest.

14:44.245 --> 14:46.305
The southwest?

14:46.306 --> 14:48.564
That's where my Grandma Dottie lives.

14:48.565 --> 14:50.912
Don't worry. On the whole...

14:50.913 --> 14:54.369
People found you likeable,
just lacking in certain areas,

14:54.370 --> 14:57.922
such as masculinity, strength
of character, charm, personality,

14:57.923 --> 15:01.713
trustworthiness,
appearance, and likability.

15:01.714 --> 15:03.787
But a minute ago, you
just said I was likeable.

15:03.788 --> 15:06.410
I know. I was trying
to make you feel better.

15:06.411 --> 15:10.054
That's why my likability
rating is so high.

15:10.055 --> 15:13.656
Okay, so, the red is negative
and the green is positive?

15:13.657 --> 15:16.314
No, the green is undecided. [Beep]

Well, how did this happen?

15:34.214 --> 15:36.237
Obviously, Lexi set you up.

15:36.238 --> 15:38.687
She told me she and Dixon
were going scuba diving,

15:38.688 --> 15:42.422
knowing I'd tell you, so
you'd show up looking foolish.

15:42.423 --> 15:44.391
