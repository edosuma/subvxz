-(clock ticking)
-(birds chirping)

00:05.005 --> 00:06.756
J. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER:
I have been asked whether,

00:06.798 --> 00:09.592
in the years to come,
it will be possible

00:09.634 --> 00:12.762
to kill 40 million
American people

00:12.804 --> 00:17.225
by the use of atomic bombs
in a single night.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.522
I am afraid that the answer
to that question is yes.

00:22.564 --> 00:24.858
-* *
-(clock ticking)

00:24.899 --> 00:27.902
JON ELSE: Robert Oppenheimer was
the father of the atomic bomb.

00:28.695 --> 00:32.741
He was this complex ball
of contradictions.

00:33.908 --> 00:36.036
OPPENHEIMER:
They are weapons of aggression,

00:36.077 --> 00:37.871
of surprise and of terror.

00:37.912 --> 00:41.916
RICHARD RHODES: Oppenheimer
wanted the bomb to be used.

00:41.958 --> 00:45.253
How else would the world
know what it was?

00:45.295 --> 00:47.380
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT:
Dr. Oppenheimer,

00:47.422 --> 00:52.427
are we creating something
we may not be able to control?

00:54.012 --> 00:58.600
OPPENHEIMER: In a world of
atomic weapons, wars will cease.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.560
(ticking)

01:00.602 --> 01:02.312
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
It is D-minus one for the test

01:02.354 --> 01:04.439
of the world's first
atomic device.

01:05.607 --> 01:08.610
ELSE:
This cultured, nonviolent man

01:08.651 --> 01:10.737
was responsible for birthing

01:10.779 --> 01:14.032
the most violent weapon
in human history.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.659
And he devoted the rest of
his life to trying to control

01:16.701 --> 01:19.120
the monster
that he had unleashed.

01:19.954 --> 01:22.665
OPPENHEIMER:
If there is another world war...

01:26.169 --> 01:29.631
...this civilization
may go under.

01:31.508 --> 01:34.928
KAI BIRD:
He became a political pariah.

01:34.969 --> 01:36.596
EDWARD R. MURROW: Is it true
that humans have already

01:36.638 --> 01:40.100
discovered a method
of destroying humanity?

01:40.141 --> 01:41.810
(cameras clicking)

01:43.311 --> 01:45.772
ELSE:
And it finally ruined him.

01:46.940 --> 01:50.110
OPPENHEIMER:
"Now I am become Death,

01:50.151 --> 01:52.487
the destroyer of worlds."

01:53.321 --> 01:55.532
(explosion booming)

01:57.033 --> 01:59.119
We have made a thing that,
by all standards

01:59.160 --> 02:03.665
of the world we grew up in,
is an evil thing.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.838
(birds chirping)

02:12.340 --> 02:14.467
ELLEN BRADBURY REID:
When I was 15,

02:14.509 --> 02:17.512
I had a chance
to speak to Oppenheimer alone.

02:19.097 --> 02:21.224
He was at a cocktail party.

02:21.266 --> 02:24.352
I was serving hors d'oeuvres...

02:24.394 --> 02:26.813
(faint chatter)

02:26.855 --> 02:29.983
...and found Oppenheimer
standing alone.

02:30.025 --> 02:34.070
I said, "I think
you're some sort of a saint."

02:34.112 --> 02:36.906
And he was very taken aback.

02:38.450 --> 02:42.662
And he said, "Wh-Why would you
say that to me?"

02:42.704 --> 02:46.833
And I said, "Because
you had second thoughts."

02:46.875 --> 02:49.210
And he turned around
and picked his hat up

02:49.252 --> 02:51.338
and walked out the door.

02:51.379 --> 02:55.675
It obviously struck him in a way

02:55.717 --> 02:58.553
that I had never imagined.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.431
MAN: Oppenheimer for Cronkite,
take one.

03:01.473 --> 03:02.766
(film beeps)

03:02.807 --> 03:04.517
WALTER CRONKITE:
Dr. Oppenheimer,

03:04.559 --> 03:07.228
with all the inevitability
of the decision

03:07.270 --> 03:10.357
that history demonstrates to us,

03:10.398 --> 03:13.026
you still seem to suffer,
may I say,

03:13.068 --> 03:15.987
from a bad conscience about it.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.155
Is that true, sir?

03:17.197 --> 03:20.033
Uh, I think when you play

03:20.075 --> 03:23.536
a meaningful part
in bringing about the death

03:23.578 --> 03:26.373
of over
a hundred thousand people...

03:27.957 --> 03:32.379
...uh, you naturally, uh,

03:32.420 --> 03:36.925
don't think of that with ease.

03:38.218 --> 03:42.555
CHRISTOPHER NOLAN: When you look
at the history of Oppenheimer,

03:42.597 --> 03:45.558
it's very difficult to find
any person in history

03:45.600 --> 03:48.937
sitting in
such a complex situation

03:48.978 --> 03:53.358
with all kinds of
impossible questions

03:53.400 --> 03:55.777
and very few answers.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.654
(ticking)

03:57.696 --> 04:00.281
ELSE:
Everybody has their own idea

04:00.323 --> 04:02.826
of what Robert Oppenheimer is.

04:02.867 --> 04:05.662
I mean, the fact is
that he invented a weapon

04:05.704 --> 04:08.039
that can destroy
human life on Earth.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.917
I mean, don't forget
that this weapon,

04:10.959 --> 04:14.254
which has the capacity
to end civilization,

04:14.295 --> 04:18.758
was developed as a means
to save Western civilization.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.804
-(newsreel music playing)
-(bell clanging)

04:29.936 --> 04:32.981
(shouting in German)

04:34.482 --> 04:36.234
(crowd chanting in German)

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
BIRD: In the 1930s,
millions of Americans

04:38.319 --> 04:40.947
were following the news
coming out of Europe

04:40.989 --> 04:45.410
in their local theaters,
watching newsreels.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.454
And Oppenheimer was

04:47.495 --> 04:49.581
horrified by the rise of Hitler.

04:50.915 --> 04:54.794
NOLAN: His sense of his own
Jewishness made him immediately

04:54.836 --> 04:58.006
and massively aware
of the danger of fascism.

04:58.048 --> 04:59.591
(bell tolling)

04:59.632 --> 05:02.385
BIRD:
When the war started in 1939,

05:02.427 --> 05:04.471
he was a professor at Berkeley.

05:04.512 --> 05:06.765
And that same year,

05:06.806 --> 05:10.226
one of his students
comes rushing into his office

05:10.268 --> 05:13.605
to convey the news that
fission has been discovered.

05:13.646 --> 05:17.025
MAN: Word has just come through
from Germany

05:17.067 --> 05:20.612
that the uranium atom
under neutron bombardment

05:20.653 --> 05:23.990
actually splits into two parts.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.620
BIRD: Initially,
Oppenheimer can't believe it.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.873
He runs to the blackboard
and does some mathematics,

05:31.915 --> 05:34.918
and he comes
to the understanding

05:34.959 --> 05:39.631
that you could use fission
to generate energy.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.758
Einstein showed explicitly

05:41.800 --> 05:46.680
that if you can convert matter
into pure energy,

05:46.721 --> 05:48.848
the amount of energy
is extraordinary.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.560
It's the speed of light squared,
for crying out loud.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.688
(crackling)

05:54.729 --> 05:58.149
RHODES: They realize that from
a very small amount of matter,

05:58.191 --> 06:01.111
you could make power
to drive ships and planes

06:01.152 --> 06:04.531
and trains, whatever,
make electricity, of course.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.867
And they also realize
very quickly

06:07.909 --> 06:09.577
that it might be possible
to make

06:09.619 --> 06:12.247
a weapon of untold destruction.

06:12.288 --> 06:14.541
(Hitler shouting in German)

06:14.582 --> 06:16.126
(crowd chanting)

06:16.167 --> 06:18.378
We were deeply worried.

06:18.420 --> 06:22.007
After all, the discovery
of fission was in Nazi Germany.

06:23.591 --> 06:27.220
MAREENA ROBINSON SNOWDEN: Nazi
Germany could potentially build

06:27.262 --> 06:30.056
a nuclear bomb.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.517
This was the worry.
And it was very tangible.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.727
It was very real.

06:33.768 --> 06:36.563
(plane engines buzzing)

06:40.316 --> 06:44.696
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT:
December 7, 1941,

06:44.738 --> 06:48.700
a date which will live
in infamy.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.368
Pearl Harbor happens.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.328
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT:
I assert

06:52.370 --> 06:55.582
that this form of treachery

06:55.623 --> 06:58.418
shall never again endanger us.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.754
(cheering, applause)

07:00.795 --> 07:02.881
ALAN CARR:
Now the United States

07:02.922 --> 07:06.009
is an active combatant
in the war.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.348
The idea at this point is

07:11.389 --> 07:13.600
we basically need to get this
done as quickly as possible,

07:13.641 --> 07:15.101
because we could
wake up tomorrow

07:15.143 --> 07:17.562
and Hitler could have
that nuclear monopoly

07:17.604 --> 07:20.357
that we all want to avoid.

07:20.398 --> 07:24.444
So, we need a place
where we can design, build, test

07:24.486 --> 07:27.739
and help deliver
nuclear weapons.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.284
But even before
we pick the place though,

07:31.326 --> 07:34.454
we need to find somebody
who can lead that installation.

07:34.496 --> 07:39.084
And virtually nobody expected
Oppenheimer to be named

07:39.125 --> 07:42.212
the director of
the weapons design laboratory.

07:43.338 --> 07:45.924
He was kind of
this ethereal personality.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.427
He had no record
of having big achievements.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.764
One of the scientists
who knew Oppenheimer said,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.725
"This is a man who couldn't run
a hot dog stand."

07:55.767 --> 07:58.311
RHODES:
Oppenheimer's friends felt

07:58.353 --> 08:03.733
that he was a divided man
not quite sure of his identity.

08:03.775 --> 08:07.946
He said at one point,
"From my earliest days,

08:07.987 --> 08:10.031
"I never did anything

08:10.073 --> 08:12.867
"or thought anything
or knew anyone

08:12.909 --> 08:18.039
where I didn't feel about myself
the deepest loathing."

08:21.918 --> 08:23.962
(ticking)

08:29.217 --> 08:31.928
JENNET CONANT:
Oppenheimer was born in 1904

08:31.970 --> 08:36.349
and into an age of
great scientific possibility.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.853
The first two decades
of the 20th century

08:39.894 --> 08:43.523
were periods of
incredible intellectual daring.

08:43.565 --> 08:47.193
Electricity, automobiles, flight

08:47.235 --> 08:50.113
were all transforming
daily life.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.950
And then you had
incredible advances in science,

08:53.992 --> 08:56.077
and it looks like

08:56.119 --> 08:57.912
almost anything
could be achieved.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.208
DAVID EISENBACH:
Story of Robert Oppenheimer

09:02.250 --> 09:04.711
is really the story
of immigrant America.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.380
His father comes over
from Germany,

09:07.422 --> 09:11.134
gets a job
in the garment industry

09:11.176 --> 09:12.886
and makes a tremendous amount
of money,

09:12.927 --> 09:18.308
winds up on the Upper West Side
on Riverside Drive.

09:20.060 --> 09:25.273
And he's got a Picasso,
and he's got three van Goghs.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.986
HERKEN: His mother was
a Paris-trained artist

09:30.028 --> 09:32.655
who exhibited her work at
various galleries in Manhattan.

09:33.865 --> 09:36.534
RHODES:
She was a nervous person.

09:36.576 --> 09:41.206
She really didn't let
this little boy go outside.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.419
BIRD:
And he was very sheltered

09:46.461 --> 09:48.588
and extremely socially awkward.

09:49.589 --> 09:53.802
RHODES: When he finally went to
camp one summer, he was so nasty

09:53.843 --> 09:57.555
to the other kids
that they roughed him up.

09:58.765 --> 10:04.437
He said later they put him
in the icehouse all night naked

10:04.479 --> 10:07.649
and painted him green,

10:07.691 --> 10:09.859
including his genitals.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.071
Oddly enough,
Oppenheimer didn't protest.

10:13.113 --> 10:16.700
He just took
his punishment stoically.

10:18.993 --> 10:21.079
It was a very odd reaction

10:21.121 --> 10:23.498
for a young boy at that age.

10:24.582 --> 10:28.378
RHODES: Imagine this sensitive
boy, this very smart boy,

10:28.420 --> 10:32.090
but one who has no idea
how to deal with other people.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.342
Certainly not with
children his own age.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.678
He's had no experience.

10:38.179 --> 10:40.724
ALEX WELLERSTEIN: The real core
psychological moment

10:40.765 --> 10:44.227
for Oppenheimer appears to have
been when he was in college.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.898
And he goes to study physics
at Cambridge,

10:48.940 --> 10:52.569
and he doesn't do very well.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.112
He ends up in a laboratory

10:54.154 --> 10:56.072
that's really about
experimental physics,

10:56.114 --> 10:58.867
and he is not good at that.

10:58.908 --> 11:03.204
He doesn't really know how to do
an experiment with his hands.

11:04.873 --> 11:07.292
And he has this sort of
crisis of confidence.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.963
BIRD: This came to a head
when he had a...

11:12.005 --> 11:13.506
what I think
can only be described

11:13.548 --> 11:14.758
as a nervous breakdown.

11:15.717 --> 11:20.096
One of his friends stumbled
upon him in an empty classroom

11:20.138 --> 11:22.390
where Oppenheimer was
standing at the blackboard.

11:23.391 --> 11:27.520
EISENBACH: Muttering to himself
over and over again,

11:27.562 --> 11:29.898
"The point is,
the point is, the point is."

11:30.690 --> 11:34.486
BIRD: And he could never
finish the sentence.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.529
MARTIN J. SHERWIN: And then
another one of his friends

11:36.571 --> 11:40.700
went to his dorm room
and heard this moaning inside

11:40.742 --> 11:42.369
and opened the door,

11:42.410 --> 11:44.913
and there was Oppenheimer
in a fetal position,

11:44.954 --> 11:47.791
rolling back and forth,
groaning.

11:47.832 --> 11:51.002
He literally came close

11:51.044 --> 11:53.505
to committing suicide
at that point.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.635
EISENBACH: He saw a psychiatrist
as a result of this,

11:58.677 --> 12:00.303
and the psychiatrist said

12:00.345 --> 12:04.224
that he's kind of living
in his own world.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.184
RHODES: He was having
an identity crisis,

12:06.226 --> 12:09.562
something we're clearer about
these days than we were then.

12:09.604 --> 12:11.606
BIRD:
His parents took him to Paris,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.067
where he saw
yet another psychologist,

12:14.109 --> 12:17.237
and in a very French way,

12:17.278 --> 12:20.532
prescribed a professional woman
and red wine.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.201
(laughs) So...

12:23.243 --> 12:25.787
Uh, we don't know
if that happened.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.459
SHERWIN: He had always been
the top of the class,

12:31.501 --> 12:34.087
the smartest person,

12:34.129 --> 12:37.257
admired for
his intellectual capability

12:37.298 --> 12:40.301
by all his classmates.

12:40.343 --> 12:44.097
And suddenly,
he was an incompetent.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.184
And he just couldn't deal
with that at that point.

12:48.226 --> 12:51.438
And what snapped him out of that

12:51.479 --> 12:56.026
was his discovery of theoretical
physics, of quantum physics.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.655
At the time, it was sort of
the golden age of physics.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.325
It's a very exciting time
to be a theorist.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.787
And if you are young
and quick and willing to think

13:07.829 --> 13:11.124
weird ideas that nobody else
has ever thought,

13:11.166 --> 13:13.501
you can potentially make
a huge amount of progress

13:13.543 --> 13:14.961
and a name for yourself.

13:17.297 --> 13:19.424
BIRD: So, when Oppenheimer
decided to move

13:19.466 --> 13:21.968
to Göttingen in Germany to study

13:22.010 --> 13:25.930
with Max Born,
a theoretical physicist,

13:25.972 --> 13:27.474
he blossomed.

13:27.515 --> 13:31.019
He meets
some of the leading physicists

13:31.061 --> 13:32.645
in Germany at the time--

13:32.687 --> 13:36.066
Heisenberg,
who, ironically enough,

13:36.107 --> 13:39.194
would lead
the German atomic bomb project.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.072
WELLERSTEIN:
And while he's over there,

13:42.113 --> 13:45.367
he sort of invents
this Oppie personality.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.994
This is where he gets the name.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.955
They call him Opje,
and this turns into Oppie.

13:52.165 --> 13:56.169
And Oppie is not
an insecure young American

13:56.211 --> 13:58.672
who doesn't really know
what he wants to do.

13:58.713 --> 14:00.674
Oppie is the brilliant guy

14:00.715 --> 14:03.218
who is always five steps ahead
of everybody else

14:03.259 --> 14:05.011
and can keep everything
in his head.

14:05.053 --> 14:08.014
Oppie is a genius who's
very eccentric and interesting

14:08.056 --> 14:13.353
and strikes a really dashing
figure and is chain-smoking.

14:13.395 --> 14:17.065
And you see these pictures
of him from the '20s.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.527
It's very Bob Dylan.

14:20.568 --> 14:24.239
ELSE: He had the eyes
of an Old Testament prophet

14:24.280 --> 14:26.658
inside this frail body,

14:26.700 --> 14:29.160
and he sort of cocked himself
with his funny little

14:29.202 --> 14:31.663
porkpie hat on top.

14:32.414 --> 14:36.209
WELLERSTEIN: So, Oppie is
this sort of construction

14:36.251 --> 14:39.671
of everything
that he would want to be.

14:40.964 --> 14:44.592
And that recreation is
immensely successful.

14:46.011 --> 14:48.513
(ticking)

14:51.474 --> 14:54.060
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
When the cancerous Nazi growth

14:54.102 --> 14:57.022
spread farther still,
the people of Europe--

14:57.063 --> 15:00.692
and the world--
enter the new era.

15:00.734 --> 15:04.070
RHODES: Certainly the first
motivation for the scientists

15:04.112 --> 15:06.573
was to beat the Germans
to the bomb.

15:06.614 --> 15:09.159
There's nothing like
the prospect of a hanging

15:09.200 --> 15:10.744
to concentrate the mind.

15:10.785 --> 15:14.539
And the threat of death
of civilization as they knew it

15:14.581 --> 15:20.670
was so great that it swept away
any ethical or moral doubts

15:20.712 --> 15:22.297
that they might have had.

15:23.089 --> 15:27.052
WELLERSTEIN: Ultimately,
whoever gets the bomb first

15:27.093 --> 15:28.345
is not just gonna win
World War II

15:28.386 --> 15:30.013
but is gonna run
the entire world.

15:31.056 --> 15:32.766
* *

15:32.807 --> 15:35.310
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
By the summer of 1942,

15:35.352 --> 15:38.772
control of the atom bomb project
passes to the hands of the Army,

15:38.813 --> 15:42.650
under the code name
Manhattan Engineering District.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.861
CARR:
The Manhattan Project really was

15:44.903 --> 15:47.280
a huge national effort.

15:47.322 --> 15:51.618
RHODES: And to plot out
the industrial scale

15:51.659 --> 15:55.747
of the operation,
they chose a dynamic, burly,

15:55.789 --> 15:57.123
six-foot-three,

15:57.165 --> 16:00.293
240-pound general

16:00.335 --> 16:03.630
named Leslie Richard Groves.

16:04.673 --> 16:07.759
He hated Leslie.
He went by Dick.

16:08.885 --> 16:11.346
General Groves had a problem.

16:11.388 --> 16:13.848
He was entrusted
to hire the people

16:13.890 --> 16:15.350
that would build
the atomic bomb.

16:15.392 --> 16:18.311
But he knew
that we're talking about

16:18.353 --> 16:22.357
the people who are the
finest scientists in the world.

16:23.858 --> 16:26.027
These are prima donnas.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.322
And now you have to have
somebody who's gonna be

16:29.364 --> 16:31.199
the whipmaster.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.909
You have to have somebody

16:32.951 --> 16:35.578
that understands the physics,
who has a reputation,

16:35.620 --> 16:38.665
so that these prima donnas
will follow you.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.879
CARR: Oppenheimer and
General Groves are introduced

16:44.921 --> 16:47.340
in the fall of 1942.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.384
And these two individuals
are just about

16:49.426 --> 16:51.386
as different as you can imagine.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.973
But General Groves
saw something in him

16:55.015 --> 16:56.766
that apparently no one else saw.

16:58.393 --> 17:00.270
GROVES:
When meeting Oppenheimer,

17:00.311 --> 17:02.355
you were immediately impressed.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.941
You couldn't help it.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.527
There wasn't a better man.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.865
RHODES: He chose Oppenheimer
against the advice

17:11.906 --> 17:14.826
of most of these leaders
that he had around him

17:14.868 --> 17:16.453
in the scientific community.

17:16.494 --> 17:20.915
Oppenheimer had never led
any large enterprise.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.794
But Oppenheimer was really good
at explaining things.

17:25.587 --> 17:27.380
WELLERSTEIN:
He was extremely charming,

17:27.422 --> 17:29.716
and he had this ability

17:29.758 --> 17:32.844
to sort of hold a lot of things
in his head at once

17:32.886 --> 17:36.848
and keep aware of
how they all fit together.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.352
And this is apparently

17:40.393 --> 17:43.104
what General Groves
recognized in him.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.609
EISENBACH:
For security purposes,

17:47.650 --> 17:52.280
this project needs to happen
away from everything.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.909
So Groves tells Oppenheimer

17:55.950 --> 17:59.579
to just come up with a place
where this would actually work.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.415
And it was Oppenheimer
who suggests

18:02.457 --> 18:05.543
the New Mexico desert.

18:05.585 --> 18:08.296
So they go to scope out a site.

18:08.338 --> 18:10.632
It's called Los Alamos.

18:12.676 --> 18:14.594
CARR:
Oppenheimer knew the area well.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.429
He had spent a lot of time here.

18:18.014 --> 18:21.101
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER: When
he left New York as a young man

18:21.142 --> 18:24.062
and went to New Mexico...

18:25.271 --> 18:28.650
...that was a-- just a really
important part of his life.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.320
Going to New Mexico
and meeting cowboys

18:32.362 --> 18:33.780
and riding horses.

18:33.822 --> 18:36.282
He just loved it.
He loved every part of it.

18:38.159 --> 18:41.121
BIRD: He once said that
his ambition was to combine

18:41.162 --> 18:43.790
the two loves in his life,

18:43.832 --> 18:46.418
physics and New Mexico.

18:48.837 --> 18:51.798
And of course,
he did precisely this.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.220
CARR:
Now, the government shows up

18:57.262 --> 18:59.347
with bulldozers and architects

18:59.389 --> 19:01.641
and laborers and craftsmen

19:01.683 --> 19:05.478
to build a new community
and laboratory

19:05.520 --> 19:08.690
where there essentially
had not been one before.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.028
SNOWDEN:
They're starting from scratch.

19:13.778 --> 19:16.698
And so much of
what they were doing was unknown

19:16.740 --> 19:18.658
and unproven at the time.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.160
They didn't actually know

19:20.201 --> 19:21.327
that they would be able
to achieve this.

19:21.369 --> 19:22.662
This was all theoretical.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.833
ELSE: They knew that they had
to get the best scientists

19:26.875 --> 19:30.920
if they were gonna get this
weapon before the Nazis did.

19:30.962 --> 19:33.340
(crowd chanting)

19:33.381 --> 19:35.508
(ship horn blowing)

19:35.550 --> 19:37.052
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Albert Einstein flees

19:37.093 --> 19:38.595
to the United States.

19:38.636 --> 19:41.056
He leads a vanguard
of refugee scientists,

19:41.097 --> 19:43.350
virtually stripping
German universities

19:43.391 --> 19:44.726
of their best minds.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.938
WELLERSTEIN: All of the turmoil
in Europe had forced out

19:48.980 --> 19:52.859
a huge number
of really top-grade physicists.

19:54.444 --> 19:57.530
Enrico Fermi.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.700
Hans Bethe.

20:00.742 --> 20:04.037
Edward Teller,
who famously would go on

20:04.079 --> 20:06.539
to develop the hydrogen bomb.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.708
One can sort of
go down the lists

20:08.750 --> 20:12.253
and find more and more and more
of these amazing people.

20:13.421 --> 20:15.757
Oppenheimer was
famously known for

20:15.799 --> 20:17.717
his intellectual sex appeal.

20:17.759 --> 20:19.427
And he could go
around the country

20:19.469 --> 20:22.097
and sort of
flash his brain to people,

20:22.138 --> 20:23.848
and, you know, they'd sign up.

20:24.641 --> 20:26.142
RHODES:
He would say,

20:26.184 --> 20:30.063
"I unfortunately can't tell you
what we're doing,

20:30.105 --> 20:34.192
"but I can tell you
that if we succeed,

20:34.234 --> 20:36.945
"it's likely to end this war,

20:36.986 --> 20:39.406
and it may end all war."

20:39.447 --> 20:40.990
ROBERT CHRISTY:
Oppenheimer asked

20:41.032 --> 20:44.452
if I would join him
in Los Alamos.

20:44.494 --> 20:47.080
And I said I would be delighted.

20:47.122 --> 20:48.790
Like most of his students,

20:48.832 --> 20:53.753
I would more or less follow him
to the ends of the Earth.

20:53.795 --> 20:56.798
If you had the choice
of fighting the Nazis

20:56.840 --> 20:58.967
by going to
this exotic mountaintop

20:59.009 --> 21:02.137
and doing the greatest physics
in history,

21:02.178 --> 21:04.264
I mean, what would you do?

21:04.305 --> 21:05.974
I would've been
on the next train.

21:07.600 --> 21:08.977
I don't think people thought

21:09.019 --> 21:10.562
that much about
the consequences.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.355
You know, can we blame them?

21:12.397 --> 21:14.274
OPPENHEIMER:
We were all aware of

21:14.315 --> 21:18.778
the fact that, in one way
or another, we were intervening

21:18.820 --> 21:23.867
explicitly and heavy-handedly
in the course of human history.

21:28.830 --> 21:31.666
CARR: By the time
the laboratory was established,

21:31.708 --> 21:33.043
Oppenheimer was a family man.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.670
He was married.
He had a little boy.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.924
During his tenure
as director at the laboratory,

21:39.966 --> 21:42.510
he had a little girl as well.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.680
BIRD:
The summer of 1939,

21:45.722 --> 21:47.974
he was at a cocktail party
in Berkeley,

21:48.016 --> 21:52.062
and a young woman named
Kitty Puening had spied him

21:52.103 --> 21:57.692
from across the garden and was
immediately attracted to him.

21:58.693 --> 22:03.698
She was a firecracker
(laughs) of a young woman.

22:07.786 --> 22:10.997
They fell in love, and by 1940,

22:11.039 --> 22:12.332
she was pregnant.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.042
(laughs)

22:15.835 --> 22:17.754
SHERWIN:
They live ever after.

22:17.796 --> 22:21.549
And notice I didn't say
"happily." (laughs)

22:21.591 --> 22:25.178
They are devoted to each other.

22:25.220 --> 22:28.640
But it's a difficult marriage
because of

22:28.682 --> 22:34.020
the complexity of Robert's life,
of their personalities,

22:34.062 --> 22:36.648
of the environment
in which they live.

22:39.901 --> 22:41.611
NOLAN:
She was an academic,

22:41.653 --> 22:43.446
and she was a biologist
and a botanist,

22:43.488 --> 22:46.491
and ultimately, that work
was all put to one side

22:46.533 --> 22:48.618
for the years at Los Alamos.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.662
I think she was very frustrated

22:50.704 --> 22:53.498
by being put in the position of

22:53.540 --> 22:55.750
a mother and a wife
and nothing else.

22:58.294 --> 23:01.631
CONANT: She did not thrive
at Los Alamos.

23:01.673 --> 23:04.092
It was a lonely
and hard existence.

23:05.260 --> 23:08.847
And she disappeared
into the bottle somewhat.

23:13.768 --> 23:17.480
Oppenheimer was famous
for mixing his gin martinis.

23:17.522 --> 23:19.691
(laughter)

23:19.733 --> 23:24.571
He persuaded his scientists to
work very hard during the week

23:24.612 --> 23:28.408
and to party hard
on the weekends.

23:28.450 --> 23:31.077
RHODES: Everyone was hungover
on Sunday morning,

23:31.119 --> 23:33.371
but they worked a lot,
and they worked hard,

23:33.413 --> 23:34.664
and they worked together.

23:34.706 --> 23:37.167
And that was largely
Oppenheimer.

23:42.255 --> 23:44.716
BIRD: Los Alamos
for many of these people were

23:44.758 --> 23:46.843
the most momentous years
of their lives.

23:50.013 --> 23:52.432
They felt part of something,

23:52.474 --> 23:56.269
part of something meaningful
and important.

23:56.311 --> 24:00.273
And they were led by
this very enigmatic,

24:00.315 --> 24:05.820
strange, bright, blue-eyed
young man whom they all admired.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.162
REID:
I grew up at Los Alamos.

24:16.373 --> 24:19.834
And my father came to Los Alamos
during the Manhattan Project.

24:21.670 --> 24:26.966
It was a-a curious place to live

24:27.008 --> 24:30.929
because they're blowing
things up three times a day.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.472
(explosion rumbles)

24:32.514 --> 24:35.809
Explosions were at
10:00 and 12:00 and 3:00,

24:35.850 --> 24:37.102
so when you're in first grade,

24:37.143 --> 24:38.520
it means recess, lunch
and school's out.

24:38.561 --> 24:40.814
(excited chatter)

24:40.855 --> 24:42.732
We were actually,
as little kids,

24:42.774 --> 24:45.151
connoisseurs of explosions.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.863
And at some point,
I asked my father,

24:48.905 --> 24:50.365
"What-what are you doing?"

24:50.407 --> 24:52.742
And he said,
"Well, we're doing something

24:52.784 --> 24:54.452
that has never been
done before."

24:54.494 --> 24:57.372
I thought, "That's got to be
pretty interesting,

24:57.414 --> 24:58.456
whatever it is."

24:58.498 --> 25:00.709
* *

25:08.675 --> 25:13.805
CARR: We get about a year into
the laboratory's existence,

25:13.847 --> 25:15.765
and we come to find
that it's gonna be

25:15.807 --> 25:17.350
a lot harder than we thought.

25:17.392 --> 25:20.228
Every little thing is hard.

25:20.270 --> 25:24.232
These are
some very complex machines.

25:25.567 --> 25:27.902
A nuclear weapon is not an idea.

25:27.944 --> 25:31.614
Think of a nuclear weapon
more as like a million ideas

25:31.656 --> 25:35.076
that have to come together
and work perfectly together.

25:36.953 --> 25:39.956
To make an atomic bomb,
you need the fuel for it.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.542
(electrical warbling)

25:42.584 --> 25:45.837
CARR: We have plutonium,
and we have enriched uranium.

25:45.879 --> 25:47.380
We have two different types
of material

25:47.422 --> 25:49.716
that we're going to try and use.

25:49.758 --> 25:52.886
Plutonium was
the better material to use.

25:52.927 --> 25:54.763
There was gonna be more of it.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.390
You needed less of it
to make a bomb,

25:57.432 --> 26:00.602
and yet it was harder
to detonate.

26:00.643 --> 26:02.145
(electrical popping)

26:02.187 --> 26:07.108
The initial way to make a bomb
was called gun assembly.

26:07.150 --> 26:12.989
It was to take
two pieces of material

26:13.031 --> 26:15.241
and slam them together...

26:15.283 --> 26:16.576
(explosion)

26:16.618 --> 26:19.329
...causing a critical mass
and an explosion.

26:19.371 --> 26:23.249
And that was fine if you used
highly enriched uranium.

26:23.291 --> 26:27.754
But one day, they discovered
it won't work with plutonium.

26:27.796 --> 26:31.341
The plutonium
turned out to be so reactive

26:31.383 --> 26:33.593
that you couldn't
fire it up a barrel

26:33.635 --> 26:36.262
even at 3,000 feet per second.

26:36.304 --> 26:37.639
It would fizzle.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.974
It would melt down
before it got up the barrel.

26:40.016 --> 26:41.476
NORRIS:
It was a great shock.

26:41.518 --> 26:44.270
I mean, maybe this whole
plutonium thing had been wasted,

26:44.312 --> 26:47.273
hundreds of millions of dollars
to develop plutonium.

26:50.860 --> 26:52.278
WELLERSTEIN:
Oppenheimer was distraught,

26:52.320 --> 26:54.406
and-and Los Alamos
was distraught.

26:55.490 --> 26:59.369
RHODES: He considered resigning,
he was so depressed,

26:59.411 --> 27:01.454
and his friends
at the laboratory said,

27:01.496 --> 27:02.872
"You can't, Robert.

27:02.914 --> 27:04.791
"You've got to stay
and finish this work.

27:04.833 --> 27:07.002
It's got to happen.
We must do it."

27:07.043 --> 27:09.921
And-and reluctantly, he stayed.

27:09.963 --> 27:11.965
(filmstrip rattling)

27:12.007 --> 27:13.633
NEWSREEL NARRATOR: ...war under
the supreme command of

27:13.675 --> 27:15.468
General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

27:15.510 --> 27:17.929
Allied forces have
nearly three million troops

27:17.971 --> 27:19.472
trained for the assault.

27:19.514 --> 27:20.765
(crowd cheering)

27:20.807 --> 27:22.308
On the other side
of the channel...

27:22.350 --> 27:23.685
-(shouting in German)
-(crowd chanting in German)

27:23.727 --> 27:25.353
...the Nazis also know

27:25.395 --> 27:28.231
what the Allied forces
are preparing for,

27:28.273 --> 27:30.859
and they are making
preparations of their own.

27:30.900 --> 27:32.902
(Hitler shouting in German)

27:33.945 --> 27:35.613
BIRD:
Oppenheimer feared

27:35.655 --> 27:38.033
he was still in a race
with the Germans.

27:38.074 --> 27:40.535
Even as late
as the summer of '44,

27:40.577 --> 27:42.203
they had no real intelligence

27:42.245 --> 27:45.790
about where they were
on the German bomb project.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.794
CARR: And so, if they don't
crack the plutonium problem,

27:49.836 --> 27:52.213
they may not have
a bomb in time.

27:53.423 --> 27:56.551
NORRIS: Oppenheimer shifted
the laboratory into, you know,

27:56.593 --> 27:58.970
full-speed panic mode.

28:00.930 --> 28:02.599
WELLERSTEIN:
They had had some ideas

28:02.640 --> 28:04.684
for other types of bomb designs,
which they had thrown around

28:04.726 --> 28:06.394
at the very beginning
of the project

28:06.436 --> 28:08.855
but dismissed 'cause
they seemed too difficult.

28:08.897 --> 28:11.358
But one of them
was called implosion.

28:13.234 --> 28:16.237
The way implosion
in a nutshell works was

28:16.279 --> 28:18.698
they had a solid ball
of plutonium,

28:18.740 --> 28:20.575
just a solid sphere of it,

28:20.617 --> 28:23.703
about the size of a softball,
maybe a little bit smaller.

28:23.745 --> 28:28.792
And this is encased by
tons of high explosives.

28:30.251 --> 28:33.296
And these high explosives
are really specially made,

28:33.338 --> 28:36.591
so that when they explode,
they're gonna end up

28:36.633 --> 28:40.595
sort of focusing a blast wave
onto this ball,

28:40.637 --> 28:42.722
pushing on the top
and pushing on the bottom

28:42.764 --> 28:44.391
and pushing on both sides of it.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.935
Every angle of this is
gonna be being pushed upon

28:46.976 --> 28:50.480
with a lot of explosive force.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.775
What you want to do
is get this pressure

28:53.817 --> 28:58.279
to squeeze
the plutonium target evenly.

28:58.321 --> 29:01.324
If it were asymmetrical,
it probably wouldn't work.

29:01.366 --> 29:04.744
You had to have enough pressure
quickly enough

29:04.786 --> 29:08.915
to smash these subatomic
particles together hard enough

29:08.957 --> 29:12.127
to get them to have
this a-amazing reaction.

29:13.128 --> 29:15.338
WELLERSTEIN:
This is really hard to do.

29:15.380 --> 29:19.300
Every aspect of this is
an almost totally new problem.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.094
It is a technology
that would have benefited from

29:21.136 --> 29:22.429
another decade of development.

29:22.470 --> 29:25.140
And they didn't have that.
They had a year.

29:28.226 --> 29:30.603
CONANT: Oppenheimer was
working night and day

29:30.645 --> 29:32.439
building the bomb.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.900
And as the project grew in size,
the security service

29:35.942 --> 29:39.154
protecting the project
also grew.

29:39.195 --> 29:41.656
And even though
he was beloved and admired

29:41.698 --> 29:43.408
by most of the scientists

29:43.450 --> 29:45.702
working at
the Los Alamos project,

29:45.744 --> 29:48.788
he had fallen under
a greater veil of suspicion

29:48.830 --> 29:51.958
because there were
certain aspects of his past

29:52.000 --> 29:54.627
that raised the possibility

29:54.669 --> 29:57.005
that he could be
a security risk.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.512
* *

30:10.685 --> 30:12.604
RHODES:
When Oppenheimer was teaching

30:12.645 --> 30:14.939
at the University of California
at Berkeley,

30:14.981 --> 30:19.819
he really was
a very unworldly man

30:19.861 --> 30:21.946
focused on science,

30:21.988 --> 30:24.908
until the Depression began.

30:27.118 --> 30:28.703
He discovered, to his shock,

30:28.745 --> 30:32.999
that his students often
didn't even have enough to eat.

30:33.041 --> 30:35.835
One of them told me
he was living on

30:35.877 --> 30:38.338
cat food, cans of cat food.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.382
That was the only thing
he could afford.

30:41.633 --> 30:46.137
Oppenheimer was changed
by this discovery

30:46.179 --> 30:49.015
of-of suffering
in the world, really.

30:51.685 --> 30:54.688
BIRD: And Oppenheimer
sort of naturally,

30:54.729 --> 30:57.691
like many of his friends
in Berkeley at the time,

30:57.732 --> 31:00.402
drifted politically to the left.

31:08.410 --> 31:13.581
CARR: Communism was a very
appealing idea in the 1930s.

31:13.623 --> 31:15.208
There was no Internet.

31:15.250 --> 31:17.127
People didn't know
what was going on real time

31:17.168 --> 31:18.878
in the Soviet Union,

31:18.920 --> 31:21.715
where Joseph Stalin, of course,
was in the process of murdering

31:21.756 --> 31:24.551
20 million of his own people.

31:24.592 --> 31:26.219
(gunfire)

31:29.556 --> 31:32.225
What people here in the
United States saw instead was,

31:32.267 --> 31:35.520
hey, you know,
here in the Soviet Union,

31:35.562 --> 31:38.398
everybody is free and equal
and has a job

31:38.440 --> 31:41.359
and a place to live
and-and a future,

31:41.401 --> 31:44.738
an important role to play
in the greater collective.

31:44.779 --> 31:46.740
(crowd cheering)

31:46.781 --> 31:50.160
Now, if I don't know where
my next meal is coming from,

31:50.201 --> 31:53.371
that sounds like
a pretty good idea.

31:55.498 --> 31:59.919
It's debatable if Oppenheimer
ever really joined, officially,

31:59.961 --> 32:02.255
the Communist Party.

32:02.297 --> 32:04.341
But his brother did.

32:04.382 --> 32:06.384
Frank Oppenheimer
joined the party.

32:06.426 --> 32:09.554
Frank's wife Jackie
joined the party.

32:09.596 --> 32:12.057
Many of Oppenheimer's
close friends

32:12.098 --> 32:13.641
had joined the Communist Party.

32:13.683 --> 32:15.602
Many of his students
at Berkeley and elsewhere

32:15.643 --> 32:18.438
had been members of
the Communist Party as well.

32:19.647 --> 32:21.399
BIRD:
And in the mid '30s,

32:21.441 --> 32:24.277
he met a young woman
named Jean Tatlock,

32:24.319 --> 32:28.031
who was studying
to become a psychiatrist.

32:28.073 --> 32:30.700
Brilliant young woman.

32:30.742 --> 32:32.160
He fell in love with her.

32:33.828 --> 32:36.414
NOLAN: They were engaged
to be married twice.

32:36.456 --> 32:38.667
I think it's probably
a reasonable interpretation

32:38.708 --> 32:40.960
to say he was
somewhat obsessed with her.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.463
She was a communist.

32:43.505 --> 32:45.632
He was interested
in communist ideas.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.593
BIRD:
And for the next four years,

32:48.635 --> 32:51.638
Oppenheimer actually contributed
quite a bit of money

32:51.680 --> 32:53.640
to the Communist Party.

32:53.682 --> 32:58.103
But his political activities
began to be noticed.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.650
HERKEN:
What the FBI did in those days,

33:03.692 --> 33:06.152
they were following
the communists.

33:06.986 --> 33:08.947
They would walk around
and they would take down

33:08.988 --> 33:10.824
the license numbers
of the cars that were parked

33:10.865 --> 33:13.451
in front of the house or
the building and look them up.

33:13.493 --> 33:15.078
That's when Oppenheimer

33:15.120 --> 33:17.163
first came to the attention
of the FBI.

33:17.205 --> 33:20.750
EISENBACH: Even while he's
heading up the A-bomb project,

33:20.792 --> 33:23.920
the FBI is wiretapping
and following him.

33:23.962 --> 33:28.341
Military Intelligence is
constantly asking him questions.

33:28.383 --> 33:31.011
RHODES: He was, I think,
in a strange way,

33:31.052 --> 33:32.512
comfortable with that because

33:32.554 --> 33:35.348
he knew he wasn't doing
anything wrong.

33:36.349 --> 33:38.518
Even when he went to visit
his old girlfriend

33:38.560 --> 33:41.688
when he should not have
probably done so.

33:43.648 --> 33:47.736
In 1943, he heard
from Jean Tatlock.

33:47.777 --> 33:49.821
She was going through
some emotional crisis,

33:49.863 --> 33:51.197
and she wanted to see him.

33:51.239 --> 33:53.158
He had kept in touch with Jean.

33:53.199 --> 33:55.410
He still loved her.

33:55.452 --> 33:58.121
She had rejected him.
He had married Kitty.

33:58.163 --> 34:03.043
But he knew that Jean Tatlock
was in a depressed state,

34:03.084 --> 34:04.753
and so he visited her.

34:07.881 --> 34:12.260
RHODES: He had to leave Los
Alamos and go to San Francisco.

34:16.264 --> 34:18.600
And that was, of course,
just red meat

34:18.641 --> 34:21.102
for the, for the dog,
as it were.

34:22.062 --> 34:25.899
There were two guys
sitting outside the apartment.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.861
BIRD: Jean Tatlock
was under surveillance.

34:29.903 --> 34:32.155
She was still a member
of the Communist Party.

34:32.947 --> 34:35.075
RHODES:
He spent the night with her.

34:35.116 --> 34:36.743
They had been lovers,

34:36.785 --> 34:39.371
and I think they probably were
lovers again that night.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.458
(engine starts)

34:43.500 --> 34:47.629
BIRD: This was reported back
to Colonel Boris Pash,

34:47.671 --> 34:49.255
who was head of
Army Intelligence

34:49.297 --> 34:50.757
for all the West Coast.

34:50.799 --> 34:53.426
And Pash was convinced
that this was

34:53.468 --> 34:57.931
a serious breach of security

34:57.972 --> 34:59.808
and that perhaps Oppenheimer
was conveying nuclear secrets

34:59.849 --> 35:03.520
and atomic secrets to the
Communist Party through Tatlock.

35:05.188 --> 35:08.441
Sadly, tragically, she died

35:08.483 --> 35:11.695
just a few months later,
in the spring of 1944.

35:12.821 --> 35:17.659
Under mysterious circumstances,
her father found her naked

35:17.701 --> 35:20.704
with her head
plunged in a bathtub

35:20.745 --> 35:24.165
with her body slumped
over the edge of the bathtub.

35:25.625 --> 35:29.421
Which is a very odd way
to commit suicide.

35:29.462 --> 35:32.132
There's some speculation that

35:32.173 --> 35:34.426
perhaps she was murdered.

35:35.844 --> 35:40.181
Oppenheimer was horrified
and devastated by the news.

35:41.558 --> 35:45.145
The security officer
who informed him

35:45.186 --> 35:47.981
said that he wept openly,

35:48.023 --> 35:50.734
that he was absolutely bereft

35:50.775 --> 35:53.153
and actually confided
that there was nobody

35:53.194 --> 35:54.863
that he could speak to about it.

35:54.904 --> 35:59.576
So you sense, uh,
the loneliness of his grief.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.620
(radio static crackling)

36:02.662 --> 36:04.372
RADIO ANNOUNCER:
We interrupt this program

36:04.414 --> 36:05.540
with a special bulletin.

36:05.582 --> 36:07.667
President Roosevelt is dead.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.211
The president died
of a cerebral hemorrhage.

36:11.379 --> 36:13.548
April 1945 was
one of those months

36:13.590 --> 36:16.885
in which the fate of the world
seemed to turn on a dime.

36:18.678 --> 36:20.096
FDR dies,

36:20.138 --> 36:22.766
followed by Hitler
committing suicide.

36:22.807 --> 36:26.686
NEWSREEL NARRATOR: Hitler's
empire burns and shrivels.

36:26.728 --> 36:31.232
ELSE: The bomb was conceived
in a kind of anti-Hitler fervor.

36:31.274 --> 36:34.027
By the spring of 1945,
Hitler's out of the picture.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.446
The Nazis are
no longer a threat.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.907
Hitler is not gonna build
an atomic bomb

36:38.948 --> 36:40.450
and drop it on New York.

36:40.492 --> 36:42.285
That's not gonna happen.

36:42.327 --> 36:45.497
But there was no way they were
not gonna finish that weapon.

36:46.956 --> 36:48.750
RHODES:
They wanted to make this happen.

36:48.792 --> 36:51.753
They didn't want the war to end
before it happened.

36:51.795 --> 36:54.005
Oppenheimer wanted the bomb
to be used,

36:54.047 --> 36:57.676
because how else would the world
know what it was?

36:57.717 --> 36:59.928
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Harry S. Truman was sworn in

36:59.969 --> 37:01.846
as President
of the United States.

37:01.888 --> 37:04.557
EISENBACH: By the time
Truman gets to the presidency,

37:04.599 --> 37:05.850
the wheels are in motion.

37:05.892 --> 37:08.103
This bomb is going to be
dropped somewhere.

37:08.144 --> 37:11.856
With the death of Hitler,
the target then becomes Japan.

37:13.233 --> 37:15.610
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
The never-ending air campaign

37:15.652 --> 37:17.696
against Japan's stolen empire
continues,

37:17.737 --> 37:21.950
as B-24s hammer installations
in the Palau islands.

37:25.954 --> 37:28.623
We were marching up
from island to island.

37:33.336 --> 37:37.882
Landing on the beaches against
dug-in Japanese defenses.

37:39.092 --> 37:44.431
Losing young men
in large numbers.

37:44.472 --> 37:46.016
Every day that went by

37:46.057 --> 37:48.977
without this bomb
being successfully tested

37:49.019 --> 37:51.896
was a day in which thousands
of Americans are dying.

37:51.938 --> 37:53.857
NEWSREEL NARRATOR: Thousands
of Yanks have been wounded

37:53.898 --> 37:56.693
and other thousands
have sacrificed their lives

37:56.735 --> 37:58.778
to drive a fanatical foe
from this vital base,

37:58.820 --> 38:01.656
the doorstep to Japan itself.

38:02.824 --> 38:05.201
NORRIS: They knew
the Japanese were defeated,

38:05.243 --> 38:07.787
but defeat and surrender
are two different things.

38:07.829 --> 38:10.915
So how do you get them
to surrender?

38:13.168 --> 38:17.130
OPPENHEIMER: In a world of
atomic weapons, wars will cease.

38:17.172 --> 38:19.341
And that is not a small thing.

38:21.468 --> 38:23.845
EISENBACH: The way
Oppenheimer looked at the bomb

38:23.887 --> 38:28.808
is in a kind of
Eastern metaphysical way of

38:28.850 --> 38:31.644
it is a act of destruction
and creation

38:31.686 --> 38:33.813
potentially at the same time,

38:33.855 --> 38:37.567
act of war and an act of peace,

38:37.609 --> 38:41.363
that this thing, if mishandled,

38:41.404 --> 38:45.200
could end humanity, but if
properly handled and harnessed,

38:45.241 --> 38:47.619
could actually lead to an era

38:47.660 --> 38:50.330
of peace and prosperity
for the entire world.

38:50.372 --> 38:52.665
(playful chatter)

39:01.549 --> 39:03.176
CONANT:
By the summer of '45,

39:03.218 --> 39:06.763
they had been working on
the implosion design for a year,

39:06.805 --> 39:12.560
tweaking, devising and
struggling with the challenges.

39:12.602 --> 39:14.062
WELLERSTEIN:
For this thing to work,

39:14.104 --> 39:16.189
all of those explosives
and their detonators

39:16.231 --> 39:18.108
and the things powering them
and the batteries

39:18.149 --> 39:21.528
and everything else
has got to work perfectly.

39:21.569 --> 39:22.987
And there wasn't
a really good way to figure out

39:23.029 --> 39:24.614
if that was
actually gonna happen,

39:24.656 --> 39:26.991
other than setting off
a full-size test.

39:32.747 --> 39:34.666
HERKEN:
They settle upon the site

39:34.708 --> 39:36.292
where the bomb will be tested,

39:36.334 --> 39:40.880
and Oppenheimer chooses
the name for the site: Trinity.

39:40.922 --> 39:42.632
CARR:
He had been reading

39:42.674 --> 39:44.217
the poetry of John Donne
at the time,

39:44.259 --> 39:47.220
and one of those poems,
uh, include the line,

39:47.262 --> 39:49.305
"Batter my heart,
three-personed God,"

39:49.347 --> 39:53.059
a reference to the Holy Trinity
in Christianity.

39:54.019 --> 39:57.647
HERKEN: And I think that that
was a tribute to Jean Tatlock,

39:57.689 --> 40:00.608
because Jean and Oppie
used to read

40:00.650 --> 40:03.570
the poetry of John Donne in bed.

40:05.113 --> 40:07.490
(ticking)

40:12.829 --> 40:16.416
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Sunday, July 15, 1945.

40:16.458 --> 40:18.752
Alamogordo, New Mexico.

40:18.793 --> 40:20.920
It is D-minus one for the test

40:20.962 --> 40:23.214
of the world's first
atomic device.

40:24.299 --> 40:26.760
NOLAN: The hours
leading up to the Trinity test

40:26.801 --> 40:29.596
are one of
the most extraordinary moments

40:29.637 --> 40:32.390
of-of tension imaginable.

40:32.432 --> 40:34.934
The stakes,
the billions of dollars,

40:34.976 --> 40:37.145
the hundreds of thousands
of people who'd been involved

40:37.187 --> 40:41.691
in building to this one moment
of this test of this new weapon,

40:41.733 --> 40:43.985
all of that responsibility
falling

40:44.027 --> 40:46.363
very squarely
on Oppenheimer's shoulders.

40:46.404 --> 40:48.490
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
At the bomb test site,

40:48.531 --> 40:51.034
the scientists are working
under growing pressure.

40:51.076 --> 40:53.912
They are told there must be
no further delays.

40:53.953 --> 40:56.623
The president must know
the results of the test

40:56.664 --> 40:58.792
when he meets with Stalin.

40:58.833 --> 41:00.794
CARR: The President
of the United States

41:00.835 --> 41:02.796
is about to enter into
the Potsdam Conference--

41:02.837 --> 41:05.090
Potsdam, a city in Germany.

41:05.131 --> 41:06.466
He's gonna meet
with Joseph Stalin,

41:06.508 --> 41:08.009
Winston Churchill as well,

41:08.051 --> 41:09.803
and talk about
the future of Europe

41:09.844 --> 41:11.638
and the future
of the Pacific War.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.348
The president must know

41:13.390 --> 41:17.686
if he has a nuclear weapon
in his back pocket or not.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.405
NORRIS:
Everybody was on edge,

41:28.446 --> 41:30.573
and they had to calm down
Oppenheimer.

41:30.615 --> 41:33.118
He was a bundle of nerves.

41:34.077 --> 41:35.704
RHODES:
He chain-smoked,

41:35.745 --> 41:37.664
which he pretty much
always did anyway.

41:38.998 --> 41:41.668
GROVES: It was a situation
where I did not want

41:41.710 --> 41:44.295
Dr. Oppenheimer to get nervous.

41:46.297 --> 41:48.508
There's a famous picture
from that evening

41:48.550 --> 41:52.554
where Oppenheimer himself
crawls up the tower to the top

41:52.595 --> 41:55.682
where the bomb has been hoisted.

41:55.724 --> 41:58.268
He's checking
all the final plugs

41:58.309 --> 42:02.272
to make sure
that everything is in order.

42:02.313 --> 42:03.815
He's clearly worried,

42:03.857 --> 42:07.610
trying to check
every last little detail.

42:07.652 --> 42:09.029
WELLERSTEIN:
Oppenheimer doesn't know

42:09.070 --> 42:10.572
if this thing
is gonna work at all.

42:10.613 --> 42:11.906
EISENBACH:
In fact, he had a bet

42:11.948 --> 42:13.241
with another one
of the scientists

42:13.283 --> 42:15.368
that it wouldn't work--
ten dollars.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.579
OPPENHEIMER:
There were a hundred things

42:17.620 --> 42:20.206
that could be done wrong,

42:20.248 --> 42:24.461
any one of which
could make the test a failure.

42:24.502 --> 42:26.880
NYE:
Everybody had doubts.

42:26.921 --> 42:29.049
Was it even possible?

42:29.090 --> 42:31.926
And then this question,
'cause nobody was really sure:

42:31.968 --> 42:35.055
What if we set
the whole atmosphere on fire?

42:36.806 --> 42:39.225
SNOWDEN:
What if we set off this bomb

42:39.267 --> 42:41.770
and it literally sets
the air on fire

42:41.811 --> 42:43.772
and engulfs us all?

42:45.315 --> 42:48.651
KAKU: The atmosphere is
made out of oxygen, after all.

42:48.693 --> 42:51.071
Can the oxygen of the atmosphere

42:51.112 --> 42:54.074
be set in flames
by an atomic bomb?

42:54.115 --> 42:56.701
No one knew the answer
to these questions.

43:02.540 --> 43:07.128
RHODES: It's before dawn
on July 16, 1945.

43:07.170 --> 43:08.505
It was dark.

43:08.546 --> 43:11.925
The bomb was in the tower
a hundred feet up,

43:11.966 --> 43:14.010
and they were ready to go.

43:14.052 --> 43:18.807
Oppenheimer was in one of
the bunkers that had been built.

43:22.811 --> 43:24.646
CARR:
Oppenheimer braced himself,

43:24.688 --> 43:27.607
according to some accounts
uttering the words,

43:27.649 --> 43:31.152
"Lord, these affairs
are hard on the heart."

43:32.070 --> 43:34.030
(civil defense siren blaring)

43:34.072 --> 43:35.949
MAN (over speaker):
T-minus ten,

43:35.990 --> 43:38.910
nine, eight...

43:38.952 --> 43:41.204
RHODES: Oppenheimer was
saying to himself,

43:41.246 --> 43:43.373
-"I must remain conscious."
-(ticking)

43:43.415 --> 43:44.874
MAN:
...seven...

43:44.916 --> 43:46.126
"I must remain conscious."

43:46.167 --> 43:48.128
MAN:
...six...

43:48.169 --> 43:50.422
CARR:
Seconds are hours.

43:50.463 --> 43:54.217
MAN:
...five, four,

43:54.259 --> 43:57.679
three, two...

43:57.721 --> 43:59.973
RHODES:
And all of a sudden...

44:00.015 --> 44:02.267
(explosion booming)

44:07.188 --> 44:09.357
...the whole place lit up.

44:19.534 --> 44:21.327
One of the scientists told me

44:21.369 --> 44:25.123
it felt as if someone had
opened an oven door.

44:26.207 --> 44:28.126
Suddenly, there was
this huge heat,

44:28.168 --> 44:29.961
which was radiant heat,

44:30.003 --> 44:32.339
so it came at
the speed of light as well,

44:32.380 --> 44:35.383
and then this rolling thunder
of sound,

44:35.425 --> 44:39.512
and the first mushroom cloud
started going up.

44:39.554 --> 44:43.808
It was orange and purple
and blue and yellow,

44:43.850 --> 44:47.687
and it roiled,
and it grew as it rose.

44:47.729 --> 44:51.691
And a new thing, he said,
had been created on the Earth,

44:51.733 --> 44:54.027
a new challenge for humanity.

44:58.073 --> 45:00.283
NYE:
People had seen explosions

45:00.325 --> 45:04.162
and tested bombs for decades,
but to see the size of it,

45:04.204 --> 45:08.249
just... it was just astonishing.

45:09.084 --> 45:10.919
NOLAN: There's never been
a moment like that

45:10.960 --> 45:13.713
in the history of the world.

45:13.755 --> 45:16.925
The view of the world,
the view of what matter is,

45:16.966 --> 45:21.471
what we are made of indeed,
palpably changes.

45:21.513 --> 45:26.559
It's an unleashing of a, of
a force never before imagined

45:26.601 --> 45:30.855
and could never be ignored
from this point on.

45:36.444 --> 45:40.156
OPPENHEIMER: We knew
the world would not be the same.

45:42.450 --> 45:45.286
A few people laughed.

45:46.705 --> 45:48.915
A few people cried.

45:48.957 --> 45:50.709
Most people were silent.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.127
(sniffles)

45:53.628 --> 45:57.799
I remembered the line
from the Hindu scripture,

45:57.841 --> 45:59.551
the Bhagavad Gita.

46:02.429 --> 46:04.180
Vishnu...

46:05.390 --> 46:10.061
...is trying to persuade
the prince that

46:10.103 --> 46:12.564
he should do his duty,

46:12.605 --> 46:14.941
and to impress him,

46:14.983 --> 46:20.363
takes on his multiarmed form
and says,

46:20.405 --> 46:24.993
"Now I am become Death,
the destroyer of worlds."

46:26.828 --> 46:30.665
I suppose we all thought that,
one way or another.

46:30.707 --> 46:32.959
* *

46:42.886 --> 46:46.806
CARR: After the test was over,
Oppenheimer had this strut.

46:46.848 --> 46:48.975
It was likeHigh Noon.

46:49.017 --> 46:51.144
He had done it.

46:52.479 --> 46:55.857
Oppenheimer was very proud
of this accomplishment.

46:57.192 --> 46:58.526
It was a world-changing moment,

46:58.568 --> 47:02.155
and a lot of the scientists
realized that.

47:05.700 --> 47:07.369
Now came the business of

47:07.410 --> 47:10.038
what the government would do
with their creation.

47:12.540 --> 47:14.167
CONANT:
Groves hurried back

47:14.209 --> 47:16.294
to his Washington office
and cabled the news

47:16.336 --> 47:19.506
that the bomb experiment
had been a success

47:19.547 --> 47:23.468
and even more powerful than
they had anticipated.

47:24.678 --> 47:28.181
This information is
transmitted to Truman, who...

47:28.223 --> 47:30.392
entire attitude changes
at Potsdam.

47:30.433 --> 47:33.144
He suddenly feels like
he has a win in-in sight.

47:33.186 --> 47:35.855
He suddenly starts
bossing around Stalin.

47:35.897 --> 47:39.234
He decides the Japanese
get no concessions whatsoever.

47:40.402 --> 47:42.529
Truman had known
that this existed

47:42.570 --> 47:45.699
since he became president,
but to know it actually works

47:45.740 --> 47:47.826
and it's even more powerful
than we thought,

47:47.867 --> 47:51.413
that's a really different
position for him to be in.

47:51.454 --> 47:55.458
Our demand has been,
and it remains,

47:55.500 --> 47:59.045
-unconditional surrender!
-(applause)

47:59.087 --> 48:02.090
(filmstrip slowing to a stop)

48:02.132 --> 48:03.633
NYE:
My mom and dad

48:03.675 --> 48:05.885
were both veterans
of World War II, and my mom,

48:05.927 --> 48:09.055
she said, "You know, after...

48:09.097 --> 48:11.808
"after four years of this thing,

48:11.850 --> 48:15.228
"there was nobody really...
there was nobody going,

48:15.270 --> 48:18.440
'Was it ethical to use
a-a nuclear weapon?'"

48:19.816 --> 48:22.736
Right? Just get it over with.

48:22.777 --> 48:24.821
This is horrible. Like, this--

48:24.863 --> 48:28.241
Whatever you can do
to shorten this thing.

48:28.283 --> 48:31.327
Everybody was terrified
and exhausted,

48:31.369 --> 48:35.832
and everybody knew somebody
who knew somebody

48:35.874 --> 48:38.668
who was not living anymore
because of this.

48:40.587 --> 48:43.131
ELSE:
With the bomb ready to go,

48:43.173 --> 48:45.592
I mean, the choices
are appalling.

48:45.633 --> 48:47.927
You know, they know
perfectly well that if they use

48:47.969 --> 48:51.431
these weapons on Japanese men,
women and children in cities,

48:51.473 --> 48:54.267
there are gonna be a couple
hundred thousand people who die.

48:54.309 --> 48:59.606
But if they don't stop the war
with the bomb,

48:59.647 --> 49:01.775
there may be millions more
that die.

49:01.816 --> 49:05.320
So those seem to be
the two choices,

49:05.362 --> 49:07.739
but there was a third choice,

49:07.781 --> 49:10.909
and the third choice
was to do a demonstration.

49:10.950 --> 49:15.413
Maybe drop this bomb in
Tokyo Bay, kill very few people,

49:15.455 --> 49:17.207
make a hell of a demonstration,

49:17.248 --> 49:20.251
and maybe the Japanese
will surrender

49:20.293 --> 49:25.423
just based on having seen the
ferocious power of this thing.

49:25.465 --> 49:27.801
Oppenheimer rejected,
uh, that course,

49:27.842 --> 49:31.554
as did the planners
in Washington.

49:33.098 --> 49:35.350
(playful chatter)

49:35.392 --> 49:37.727
OPPENHEIMER:
We did think about whether, uh,

49:37.769 --> 49:40.522
its destructiveness, uh,

49:40.563 --> 49:42.315
its danger, uh,

49:42.357 --> 49:46.528
could be vividly demonstrated

49:46.569 --> 49:50.323
over a barren
and uninhabited target,

49:50.365 --> 49:53.326
and we were
very doubtful of that.

49:55.912 --> 49:59.833
Very few people would have had
a more thorough understanding

49:59.874 --> 50:04.212
than J. Robert Oppenheimer
of what was about to unfold

50:04.254 --> 50:06.297
when these weapons were used
in combat.

50:06.339 --> 50:09.426
Oppenheimer contemplated,
knowing that

50:09.467 --> 50:12.137
this destruction
would be unworldly.

50:13.346 --> 50:16.474
(wind whistling softly)

50:18.393 --> 50:22.522
BIRD: His secretary,
Anne Wilson, told me this story

50:22.564 --> 50:24.858
that I'm still struck by.

50:24.899 --> 50:26.985
After the Trinity test,

50:27.027 --> 50:31.156
she's walking to work one day
with Robert.

50:31.197 --> 50:35.452
He's a few steps ahead of her,
and he's suddenly muttering,

50:35.493 --> 50:39.414
"Those poor little people,
those poor little people."

50:40.915 --> 50:43.585
She stops him and says, "Robert,
what are you muttering about?"

50:43.626 --> 50:49.466
And he looked at her
and-and explained that,

50:49.507 --> 50:51.468
you know, the bomb
was going to be used

50:51.509 --> 50:53.970
on a Japanese city or two,

50:54.012 --> 50:57.432
and the victims were going to be

50:57.474 --> 51:01.394
civilians, a whole city.

51:01.436 --> 51:06.399
This was obviously on his mind,
painfully on his mind.

51:06.441 --> 51:11.905
And yet we know, that same week,
he was meeting with the generals

51:11.946 --> 51:14.240
who were in charge of
the bombing mission,

51:14.282 --> 51:16.534
and he was instructing them

51:16.576 --> 51:19.079
exactly how the bomb
should be dropped

51:19.120 --> 51:22.582
and at what altitude
it should be detonated

51:22.624 --> 51:26.252
for the maximum
destructive power.

51:26.294 --> 51:29.255
WELLERSTEIN: It's hard
to reconcile the sensitive,

51:29.297 --> 51:34.803
morally upright,
humanistic professor

51:34.844 --> 51:39.516
with the guy who recommends that
the bomb is dropped on cities

51:39.557 --> 51:42.143
and is calculating
the ideal height

51:42.185 --> 51:43.603
for destroying houses, right?

51:43.645 --> 51:45.814
How do you reconcile
those two things?

51:45.855 --> 51:50.860
Part of it is, I think,
Oppenheimer hoping that

51:50.902 --> 51:55.615
this will not be the first use
of nuclear weapons,

51:55.657 --> 51:58.201
that it will be the last use
of nuclear weapons.

51:58.243 --> 51:59.911
And if that's the case,

51:59.953 --> 52:02.997
then in order to ensure
that they're the last use,

52:03.039 --> 52:07.502
you want it to be as bad and
ugly and horrible as possible.

52:16.845 --> 52:20.015
RHODES:
By August of 1945,

52:20.056 --> 52:23.143
every Japanese city
of more than 50,000 people

52:23.184 --> 52:28.106
had basically been burned out,
except for three or four cities

52:28.148 --> 52:31.860
that had been deliberately
set aside for atomic bombing.

52:31.901 --> 52:34.904
Set aside because they had
physical characteristics

52:34.946 --> 52:39.868
that would allow us to see
how the bombs worked.

52:46.124 --> 52:49.336
Hiroshima was a flat city.

52:49.377 --> 52:53.882
And with the city set aside,
it was possible to see

52:53.923 --> 52:58.178
the effects of the bomb
all the way out to the edges.

52:58.219 --> 53:01.431
That's why Hiroshima was chosen.

53:09.564 --> 53:12.317
HIDEKO TAMURA:
When I was a little kid,

53:12.359 --> 53:14.444
there were seven rivers
running through,

53:14.486 --> 53:18.156
beautiful riverbanks.

53:18.198 --> 53:20.033
Water was clear.

53:20.075 --> 53:26.539
I was running through
magical gardens, flowers,

53:26.581 --> 53:29.959
looking for beautiful,
beautiful insects

53:30.001 --> 53:32.796
of all different kinds.

53:32.837 --> 53:34.673
Birds chirping.

53:34.714 --> 53:36.633
They don't understand about war.

53:36.675 --> 53:40.720
It was all over,
sound of happiness.

53:45.642 --> 53:49.104
But the sound
of the explosion came

53:49.145 --> 53:51.773
like a rage over the Earth.

53:53.483 --> 53:55.735
(explosion rumbling)

54:15.714 --> 54:17.340
TRUMAN:
A short time ago,

54:17.382 --> 54:22.971
an American airplane
dropped one bomb on Hiroshima.

54:23.013 --> 54:28.893
That bomb has more power
than 20,000 tons of TNT.

54:31.563 --> 54:34.274
It is an atomic bomb.

54:34.315 --> 54:37.986
It is a harnessing of
the basic power of the universe.

54:45.994 --> 54:49.039
We have spent
more than two billion dollars

54:49.080 --> 54:52.917
on the greatest
scientific gamble in history,

54:52.959 --> 54:54.336
and we have won.

55:00.508 --> 55:02.761
(explosion rumbling)

55:06.848 --> 55:08.516
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
Japan could read its doom.

55:08.558 --> 55:11.144
This was more than
a routine bombing.

55:11.186 --> 55:14.147
It was the funeral pyre
of an aggressor nation.

55:14.189 --> 55:16.441
* *

55:41.800 --> 55:44.761
TAMURA:
I remember every second.

55:47.347 --> 55:49.557
I've never been so helpless.

55:54.854 --> 55:56.856
I was under the debris

55:56.898 --> 56:01.695
and somehow had to crawl
to the light and come out.

56:06.908 --> 56:09.619
I had to go looking
for my mother.

56:22.090 --> 56:26.553
Seeing these miserable
dying people,

56:26.594 --> 56:29.889
you didn't want her
to be one of them.

56:31.933 --> 56:34.644
Didn't hear
one single thing about

56:34.686 --> 56:40.525
cousin, my mother
or my best friend.

56:47.657 --> 56:51.244
I would have really loved
to have died with them,

56:51.286 --> 56:55.415
because life after that
was so very challenging

56:55.457 --> 56:56.958
and so very difficult,

56:57.000 --> 57:00.170
physically
and especially mentally.

57:10.221 --> 57:14.559
REID: A few years after
the end of the war,

57:14.601 --> 57:19.064
I saw the raw footage
of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

57:24.861 --> 57:26.321
And there's no sound.

57:26.363 --> 57:30.158
It's just footage of people
with their skin

57:30.200 --> 57:33.703
and flower reverse patterns
of the kimonos

57:33.745 --> 57:35.705
burned into their skin

57:35.747 --> 57:39.250
and bodies floating
in the river.

57:39.292 --> 57:41.878
It was so shocking.

57:44.172 --> 57:47.634
And I thought, "They're all
my friends' fathers.

57:47.676 --> 57:51.137
Did they know
what they were doing?"

57:51.179 --> 57:53.848
None of it seemed
to make any sense to me

57:53.890 --> 57:55.642
that this was so horrible.

57:55.684 --> 57:57.936
(Geiger counter
clicking rapidly)

58:00.647 --> 58:02.816
CARR:
As reports of that devastation

58:02.857 --> 58:04.901
started to come back
to Los Alamos,

58:04.943 --> 58:08.780
obviously this weighed
on the scientists.

58:10.365 --> 58:12.784
Yes, it had been a horrible war,

58:12.826 --> 58:14.828
but still,
tens of thousands of people

58:14.869 --> 58:17.038
were killed in these attacks.

58:17.831 --> 58:19.833
Cities were destroyed.

58:24.212 --> 58:29.384
And that was difficult
on a lot of the scientists.

58:29.426 --> 58:32.303
And I certainly think that
it was difficult on Oppenheimer

58:32.345 --> 58:34.889
for the rest of his life.

58:36.516 --> 58:40.937
Hiroshima was far more costly

58:40.979 --> 58:44.941
in life and suffering
and inhumane

58:44.983 --> 58:47.068
than it needed to have been.

58:48.695 --> 58:51.656
This is easy to say
after the fact.

58:51.698 --> 58:53.908
-(birds chirping)
-(clock ticking)

58:58.121 --> 59:01.499
NOLAN: Oppenheimer never
apologized in any way for

59:01.541 --> 59:03.043
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

59:03.084 --> 59:06.379
He was very, very careful
and complicated

59:06.421 --> 59:08.381
in all statements he made about

59:08.423 --> 59:12.719
the moral implications of the
bomb and his involvement in it.

59:12.761 --> 59:15.722
And yet,
post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki,

59:15.764 --> 59:18.058
all of his actions
are the actions of

59:18.099 --> 59:21.519
somebody who is plagued
with guilt.

59:21.561 --> 59:22.896
(radio static crackles)

59:22.937 --> 59:25.398
DOUGLAS MacARTHUR:
We are gathered here,

59:25.440 --> 59:29.986
representatives of
the major warring powers,

59:30.028 --> 59:32.906
to conclude a solemn agreement

59:32.947 --> 59:36.242
whereby peace may be restored.

59:36.284 --> 59:38.828
(crowd cheering)

59:40.288 --> 59:42.665
TRUMAN:
I have received this afternoon

59:42.707 --> 59:45.335
a message from
the Japanese government.

59:46.753 --> 59:49.214
I deem this reply
a full acceptance

59:49.255 --> 59:52.467
of the unconditional surrender
of Japan.

59:53.426 --> 59:56.221
ELSE: And of course,
a great many people felt

59:56.262 --> 59:59.391
that the atomic bomb
had ended World War II.

01:00:00.684 --> 01:00:02.644
Perhaps it had.

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:07.941
And Robert Oppenheimer
was the guy who made it happen.

01:00:08.900 --> 01:00:11.444
ROY GLAUBER:
He was in demand everywhere.

01:00:11.486 --> 01:00:14.030
He was the cover story
forTime magazine,

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:15.949
once forLife magazine.

01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:17.992
There scarcely was
a magazine cover

01:00:18.034 --> 01:00:19.953
that he wasn't on.

01:00:19.994 --> 01:00:22.914
HERKEN: The inaugural issue
ofPhysics Today simply showed

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:26.376
a porkpie hat
on a cyclotron control.

01:00:26.418 --> 01:00:29.462
And everybody knew
the porkpie hat was Oppenheimer.

01:00:29.504 --> 01:00:31.673
(lively chatter)

01:00:31.715 --> 01:00:33.425
CONANT:
He becomes a rock star.

01:00:33.466 --> 01:00:36.886
He is the oracle
of American science.

01:00:36.928 --> 01:00:40.557
And he liked that.

01:00:41.766 --> 01:00:46.146
He probably felt that
he'd finally come through it all

01:00:46.187 --> 01:00:50.442
and he was no longer
the outsider.

01:00:52.068 --> 01:00:55.071
Now he was not only
at the center of things

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:57.323
but that he stood
at the very top.

01:00:57.365 --> 01:00:59.367
(applause)

01:01:00.702 --> 01:01:06.332
And that, I think,
was intoxicating for him.

01:01:09.210 --> 01:01:13.089
But at the same time,
he felt a real responsibility

01:01:13.131 --> 01:01:15.717
for having ushered this weapon
into the world.

01:01:19.137 --> 01:01:21.097
MAN:
Go ahead, please.

01:01:22.849 --> 01:01:26.186
Automatic control has got it.

01:01:26.227 --> 01:01:29.189
This time, Rab,
the stakes are kind of high.

01:01:29.230 --> 01:01:31.983
ISIDOR ISAAC RABI: It's going
to work all right, Robert.

01:01:32.025 --> 01:01:33.818
ELSE:
I think he felt,

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.321
as the father of
the atomic bomb, it was his duty

01:01:36.363 --> 01:01:39.199
to keep the reins
on the atomic bomb.

01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.658
MAN:
Go ahead, please.

01:01:40.700 --> 01:01:42.577
Well, we'll know in 40 seconds.

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.621
MAN:
Stay where you are.

01:01:44.662 --> 01:01:46.122
Cut.

01:01:47.248 --> 01:01:50.418
BIRD: Within three months
of Hiroshima,

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:52.087
he was giving speeches,

01:01:52.128 --> 01:01:56.716
talking about how this weapon
was a weapon for aggressors,

01:01:56.758 --> 01:02:00.220
that it is a weapon of terror.

01:02:00.261 --> 01:02:03.765
You know, this is the father
of the atomic bomb speaking.

01:02:06.935 --> 01:02:09.771
OPPENHEIMER:
If there is another world war...

01:02:11.856 --> 01:02:13.858
...this civilization

01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.194
may go under.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:26.037
We need to ask ourselves

01:02:26.079 --> 01:02:30.333
whether we're doing
all we can to avert that.

01:02:31.292 --> 01:02:32.836
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER:
I might like to read

01:02:32.877 --> 01:02:35.296
what my grandfather said
about it.

01:02:35.338 --> 01:02:37.924
This is a speech where he said,

01:02:37.966 --> 01:02:39.634
"But when you come
right down to it,

01:02:39.676 --> 01:02:41.011
"the reason that we did this job

01:02:41.052 --> 01:02:43.471
"is because it was
an organic necessity.

01:02:44.431 --> 01:02:48.059
"If you are a scientist,
you cannot stop such a thing.

01:02:48.101 --> 01:02:49.686
"If you are a scientist,
you believe

01:02:49.728 --> 01:02:51.396
"that it's good to find out
how the world works,

01:02:51.438 --> 01:02:53.982
"that it's good to find out
what realities are,

01:02:54.024 --> 01:02:57.235
"that it's good
to turn over to mankind

01:02:57.277 --> 01:02:59.612
"the greatest possible power
to control the world

01:02:59.654 --> 01:03:04.117
and deal with it according
to its lights and values."

01:03:04.159 --> 01:03:07.370
He didn't regret his role
and work during the war,

01:03:07.412 --> 01:03:12.125
but he soon after turns
so strongly towards managing

01:03:12.167 --> 01:03:15.003
the outcome of the science
they created.

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:19.132
BIRD:
He decides he doesn't want

01:03:19.174 --> 01:03:21.551
to work any longer
on building more bombs.

01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:24.679
He resigns from Los Alamos,
and he accepts a position

01:03:24.721 --> 01:03:28.808
as director of the Institute for
Advanced Studies in Princeton,

01:03:28.850 --> 01:03:32.729
where he becomes
Einstein's boss, so to speak.

01:03:32.771 --> 01:03:35.690
He's probably the most famous
scientist in America,

01:03:35.732 --> 01:03:39.819
and he's trying to use
that celebrity status

01:03:39.861 --> 01:03:42.197
to have influence.

01:03:43.406 --> 01:03:47.952
He gets an appointment with
Harry Truman in the Oval Office.

01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:50.038
Oppenheimer's agenda
is to persuade

01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:55.210
Harry Truman of the importance
of controlling this technology.

01:03:56.419 --> 01:03:59.631
And he starts
to make this pitch.

01:03:59.673 --> 01:04:02.842
And Truman interrupts him
with a question, saying,

01:04:02.884 --> 01:04:05.679
"Well, Dr. Oppenheimer,
when do you think the Russians

01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:08.723
are going to get this weapon
of mass destruction?"

01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:14.020
And Oppenheimer is sort of
taken aback by the question

01:04:14.062 --> 01:04:20.026
and says, "Well, I'm not sure
but sometime in the future."

01:04:20.068 --> 01:04:24.614
And Truman interrupts again
and says, "Well, I know. Never."

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:29.452
At that point, Oppie understands

01:04:29.494 --> 01:04:31.955
that Harry Truman
doesn't understand anything

01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:35.583
about the physics
of this weapon.

01:04:35.625 --> 01:04:41.297
And Oppenheimer, at that point,
says exactly the wrong thing.

01:04:41.339 --> 01:04:44.384
RHODES: He really offended
President Truman

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:48.555
by saying, "Mr. President,
I have blood on my hands."

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:50.598
(explosion rumbling)

01:04:51.683 --> 01:04:53.476
BIRD:
This is exactly the wrong thing

01:04:53.518 --> 01:04:55.478
to say to the guy
who made the decision

01:04:55.520 --> 01:05:00.859
to drop two such bombs
on two Japanese cities.

01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:03.445
He was trying to impress Truman.

01:05:03.486 --> 01:05:06.114
He thought it was something
that Truman would like to hear,

01:05:06.156 --> 01:05:08.408
and he got that wrong a lot.

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:10.744
I mean, Oppenheimer was very
charming to a lot of people,

01:05:10.785 --> 01:05:12.787
but he was often not charming

01:05:12.829 --> 01:05:16.082
to leaders and people
who had power over him.

01:05:16.124 --> 01:05:17.751
WELLERSTEIN:
Truman didn't believe

01:05:17.792 --> 01:05:20.837
that anybody's responsibility
was greater than his.

01:05:20.879 --> 01:05:24.215
Truman was just,
"Get that guy out of my office.

01:05:24.257 --> 01:05:26.301
I was the one
who made the decision."

01:05:27.594 --> 01:05:29.804
BIRD: He ends the meeting
very abruptly

01:05:29.846 --> 01:05:31.556
and later tells his aides that,

01:05:31.598 --> 01:05:35.477
"I don't want to see that
crybaby scientist ever again."

01:05:37.771 --> 01:05:42.442
I think the only hope
for our future safety

01:05:42.484 --> 01:05:44.527
must lie in a collaboration,

01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:47.238
based on confidence
and good faith,

01:05:47.280 --> 01:05:48.907
with the other peoples
of the world.

01:05:48.948 --> 01:05:52.952
SNOWDEN: Oppenheimer,
very early after the bombings,

01:05:52.994 --> 01:05:55.080
was a part of the team
to recommend

01:05:55.121 --> 01:05:56.581
international disarmament.

01:05:57.665 --> 01:06:00.210
But the genie was
out of the bottle.

01:06:00.251 --> 01:06:02.045
Right? Those who possess this

01:06:02.087 --> 01:06:04.297
will be able to shape
the world order.

01:06:04.339 --> 01:06:08.218
And very quickly,
the Soviet Union took note.

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:10.470
(explosion rumbling)

01:06:11.388 --> 01:06:15.225
NORRIS: The Soviets
tested a bomb in 1949

01:06:15.266 --> 01:06:17.686
to the shock of almost everyone.

01:06:19.187 --> 01:06:20.897
NEWSREEL NARRATOR: President
Truman's dramatic announcement

01:06:20.939 --> 01:06:24.734
that Russia has created
an atomic explosion

01:06:24.776 --> 01:06:26.653
sends reporters racing
for Flushing Meadow,

01:06:26.695 --> 01:06:29.948
where Russia's Vyshinsky arrives
to address the United Nations...

01:06:29.989 --> 01:06:32.992
This puts the U.S. in
a really complicated position,

01:06:33.034 --> 01:06:37.789
because it's no longer the only
country with nuclear weapons.

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:41.543
Suddenly,
you have the possibility

01:06:41.584 --> 01:06:45.171
that if war with nuclear weapons
broke out between two states

01:06:45.213 --> 01:06:47.924
that had a fair number of them,

01:06:47.966 --> 01:06:51.011
they could, in a matter
of hours, destroy themselves.

01:06:51.052 --> 01:06:52.679
(civil defense siren blaring)

01:06:52.721 --> 01:06:54.139
NEWSREEL NARRATOR:
We must all get ready now,

01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:56.349
so we know how to save ourselves

01:06:56.391 --> 01:06:59.102
if the atomic bomb
ever explodes near us.

01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.397
And one of the possible options

01:07:02.439 --> 01:07:05.567
scientists and policy people
lobbied for

01:07:05.608 --> 01:07:09.654
was to build the hydrogen bomb
as the sort of next step.

01:07:09.696 --> 01:07:11.740
(explosion rumbling)

01:07:12.782 --> 01:07:14.701
SNOWDEN:
The Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:18.747
were on the order of
15 kilotons of TNT,

01:07:18.788 --> 01:07:21.249
which is no small number
in and of itself.

01:07:23.335 --> 01:07:26.713
When you start talking about
hydrogen bombs,

01:07:26.755 --> 01:07:29.382
now we're talking about
megatons.

01:07:29.424 --> 01:07:33.511
We're talking about
a million tons of TNT.

01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:36.514
They're categorically different.

01:07:36.556 --> 01:07:38.767
A thousand times stronger than
anything you'd see

01:07:38.808 --> 01:07:41.519
in a Hiroshima
and Nagasaki bomb.

01:07:42.604 --> 01:07:45.398
ELSE: With one
very large hydrogen bomb,

01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:46.900
you can kill
about as many people

01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:49.736
as all of the people killed
in World War II.

01:07:50.737 --> 01:07:54.532
And Oppenheimer could not see
any use for that.

01:07:54.574 --> 01:07:57.869
He called it a genocidal weapon.

01:07:59.954 --> 01:08:03.917
EDWARD TELLER: At the end of the
war, most people wanted to stop.

01:08:03.958 --> 01:08:06.378
I did not.

01:08:06.419 --> 01:08:08.213
Among the people who knew

01:08:08.254 --> 01:08:11.091
a great deal about
the hydrogen bomb,

01:08:11.132 --> 01:08:13.802
I was the only advocate of it.

01:08:15.095 --> 01:08:18.014
RHODES: Edward Teller
was a Hungarian Jew

01:08:18.056 --> 01:08:22.977
who escaped from Hungary
and came to the United States.

01:08:23.019 --> 01:08:26.773
During World War II,
Teller worked at Los Alamos,

01:08:26.815 --> 01:08:30.443
but he became obsessed with
the idea of the hydrogen bomb,

01:08:30.485 --> 01:08:33.863
even before they had
the atomic bomb.

01:08:33.905 --> 01:08:36.282
HERKEN: Teller did very much
consider the atomic bomb

01:08:36.324 --> 01:08:38.702
to be Oppenheimer's creation,

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:41.246
and he wanted something
that was bigger and better.

01:08:42.497 --> 01:08:45.542
CONANT:
And Oppenheimer said to Teller,

01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:49.838
"Go back to doing physics,
but don't build this.

01:08:49.879 --> 01:08:51.798
There's no need for it."

01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.718
RHODES: Oppenheimer was
in charge of a committee

01:08:54.759 --> 01:08:57.804
that had been put together
in Washington to decide:

01:08:57.846 --> 01:08:59.014
What should we do?

01:08:59.055 --> 01:09:02.851
Should we build a hydrogen bomb?

01:09:02.892 --> 01:09:04.352
That is a question

01:09:04.394 --> 01:09:07.605
in everybody's mind,
Dr. Oppenheimer.

01:09:07.647 --> 01:09:13.194
Are we creating something
we may not be able to control?

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:16.322
The decision to try to make

01:09:16.364 --> 01:09:19.492
or not to make the hydrogen bomb

01:09:19.534 --> 01:09:21.995
touch the very basis
of our morality.

01:09:22.037 --> 01:09:24.873
And the committee decision
was basically,

01:09:24.914 --> 01:09:27.125
no, we shouldn't build
the hydrogen bomb.

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.837
If we are guided by fear alone,

01:09:30.879 --> 01:09:34.507
we'll fail
in this time of crisis.

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:39.804
The answer to fear
sometimes lies in courage.

01:09:40.889 --> 01:09:43.058
WELLERSTEIN: Oppenheimer's
opposition of the H-bomb

01:09:43.099 --> 01:09:46.644
was taken very hard by people
who were in favor for it.

01:09:48.605 --> 01:09:51.232
RHODES: The Air Force wanted
more and more bombs

01:09:51.274 --> 01:09:53.485
and bigger and bigger bombs.

01:09:53.526 --> 01:09:55.695
The bigger the bomb,
in terms of its yield,

01:09:55.737 --> 01:09:58.406
the more damage
one plane could do.

01:09:59.199 --> 01:10:01.076
HERKEN: The Strategic
Air Command was focused upon

01:10:01.117 --> 01:10:03.244
blowing up the Soviet Union.

01:10:04.079 --> 01:10:07.374
Oppenheimer said a smarter move
would be to put resources

01:10:07.415 --> 01:10:09.751
into intercepting
Soviet bombers.

01:10:10.835 --> 01:10:13.046
RHODES: He was going
just the opposite direction

01:10:13.088 --> 01:10:14.714
from what the Air Force wanted.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.592
They wanted him out.
They wanted to get rid of him.

01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:24.599
BIRD: By 1953, Oppenheimer
has made sufficient enemies

01:10:24.641 --> 01:10:27.852
in the Washington bureaucracy.

01:10:27.894 --> 01:10:30.230
And then along comes
Lewis Strauss...

01:10:30.271 --> 01:10:32.982
(applause)

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:36.069
...the new chairman of
the Atomic Energy Commission.

01:10:36.111 --> 01:10:38.947
STRAUSS: I have just returned
from the Pacific Proving Ground,

01:10:38.988 --> 01:10:42.784
where I have witnessed a test
of thermonuclear weapons.

01:10:42.826 --> 01:10:45.495
BIRD:
And Strauss knows Oppenheimer

01:10:45.537 --> 01:10:48.081
and has grown
to intensely dislike him.

01:10:48.123 --> 01:10:51.501
RHODES: Oppenheimer had been
snappish with him once,

01:10:51.543 --> 01:10:54.379
and it had deeply offended him.

01:10:54.421 --> 01:10:58.717
So Strauss begins to plot

01:10:58.758 --> 01:11:02.053
a means to defrock Oppenheimer.

01:11:03.263 --> 01:11:05.265
SHERWIN:
And how does he do it?

01:11:05.306 --> 01:11:11.104
Lewis Strauss focuses on
Oppenheimer's association

01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:13.732
with left-wing friends

01:11:13.773 --> 01:11:17.402
during the 1930s in Berkeley.

01:11:17.444 --> 01:11:19.404
MAN (over TV):
"Communism."

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:21.114
Who are the apostles of a system

01:11:21.156 --> 01:11:24.701
that attempts to destroy
the American way of life?

01:11:25.827 --> 01:11:30.165
During the Second World War,
the Soviet Union was our ally.

01:11:30.206 --> 01:11:33.043
And that sense of
being a communist

01:11:33.084 --> 01:11:36.254
or associating with communists
was not something

01:11:36.296 --> 01:11:39.299
that was considered that bad.

01:11:39.341 --> 01:11:42.635
It wasn't until the Cold War

01:11:42.677 --> 01:11:45.889
that all of a sudden,
in retrospect,

01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:50.310
anyone with any kind of legacy
of a communist past

01:11:50.352 --> 01:11:52.604
is now a security threat.

01:11:52.645 --> 01:11:55.565
If there were no communists
in our government,

01:11:55.607 --> 01:11:59.652
why did we delay, for 18 months,

01:11:59.694 --> 01:12:02.197
delay our research
on the hydrogen bomb?

01:12:02.989 --> 01:12:05.700
RHODES:
It was from attitudes like that

01:12:05.742 --> 01:12:08.620
that finally led to
the government deciding

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:11.873
they had to pull Oppenheimer's
security clearance.

01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:15.377
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER:
He would have to give up

01:12:15.418 --> 01:12:20.131
his security clearance
in 30 days or ask for a hearing.

01:12:23.176 --> 01:12:25.679
He felt he couldn't give up
his security clearance.

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.013
He couldn't agree with them

01:12:27.055 --> 01:12:29.015
that he wasn't fit
to serve his government.

01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:32.602
ELSE: He should have told them
to get lost.

01:12:33.395 --> 01:12:36.690
He should have said,
"I am the atomic bomb.

01:12:37.482 --> 01:12:39.901
"I won World War II.

01:12:39.943 --> 01:12:41.319
Fuck off."

01:12:42.237 --> 01:12:45.031
For whatever reason,
he didn't tell them to get lost.

01:12:45.073 --> 01:12:46.658
He decided to fight it.

01:12:48.201 --> 01:12:50.578
BIRD: And before
he goes down to Washington,

01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:52.372
he meets with Einstein

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:56.751
to tell him he's gonna be
absent for a few weeks,

01:12:56.793 --> 01:13:01.131
and Einstein's reaction
is quite startling.

01:13:02.757 --> 01:13:07.971
Albert says, "But, Robert,
you are Mr. Atomic.

01:13:08.013 --> 01:13:09.931
"You don't need them.
They need you.

01:13:09.973 --> 01:13:12.934
Just walk away.
Why should you go through this?"

01:13:13.893 --> 01:13:18.606
And Oppenheimer shakes his head
and apparently says to Albert,

01:13:18.648 --> 01:13:21.526
"Well, you don't understand."

01:13:21.568 --> 01:13:23.820
And he walks away,

01:13:23.862 --> 01:13:26.448
and Einstein turns
to his secretary and says,

01:13:26.489 --> 01:13:29.492
"There goes a nar."

01:13:29.534 --> 01:13:31.828
The Yiddish for a fool.

01:13:33.621 --> 01:13:36.791
(fanfare plays)

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.501
TV ANNOUNCER: World attention
was focused this week

01:13:38.543 --> 01:13:41.254
on the Atomic Energy Commission
building in Washington,

01:13:41.296 --> 01:13:43.798
where a three-man board
began special hearings

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.968
on the security file
of Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:50.096
the nuclear scientist
who developed the first A-bomb.

01:13:50.972 --> 01:13:55.185
The security hearing starts,
and it quickly becomes clear

01:13:55.226 --> 01:13:57.145
that this is not just
a security hearing.

01:13:57.187 --> 01:13:58.480
This is a trial.

01:13:58.521 --> 01:14:00.273
TV ANNOUNCER:
There's a new charge

01:14:00.315 --> 01:14:02.942
that the scientist opposed
the development of the H-bomb.

01:14:02.984 --> 01:14:06.071
WELLERSTEIN: The deck is stacked
against him, and it's ugly.

01:14:06.112 --> 01:14:08.073
They're wiretapping
his conversations

01:14:08.114 --> 01:14:10.867
with his lawyer illegally
and giving it to the prosecution

01:14:10.909 --> 01:14:13.370
so that they know
exactly what's gonna happen.

01:14:13.411 --> 01:14:16.122
They are able to look
at classified FBI files.

01:14:16.164 --> 01:14:17.999
He is not because
he doesn't have a clearance,

01:14:18.041 --> 01:14:21.211
and he can't look at
his own FBI file as a result.

01:14:22.504 --> 01:14:27.300
RHODES: Oppenheimer's
involvement with Jean Tatlock,

01:14:27.342 --> 01:14:30.387
the question of whether
his brother had been a communist

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:32.889
and still was,

01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:36.643
those were the things
they pulled out of the files.

01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:41.773
CONANT: One of the most damning
pieces of evidence

01:14:41.815 --> 01:14:44.359
that was brought out was

01:14:44.401 --> 01:14:47.737
the fact that, during the war,
there had been a conversation

01:14:47.779 --> 01:14:50.824
at his home in Berkeley
with Haakon Chevalier,

01:14:50.865 --> 01:14:53.952
his old friend,
who had mentioned to him

01:14:53.993 --> 01:14:56.287
that there was a way perhaps
that he could

01:14:56.329 --> 01:14:59.624
leak information about the
atomic project he was working on

01:14:59.666 --> 01:15:01.209
to Soviet officials.

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:03.920
Now, Oppenheimer had
dismissed it at the time,

01:15:03.962 --> 01:15:07.173
but he had not
reported the incident.

01:15:07.215 --> 01:15:10.051
He knew he was already on
thin ice with security people,

01:15:10.093 --> 01:15:13.263
that he was suspected
because of his communist ties.

01:15:13.304 --> 01:15:18.018
So he was trying to keep himself
out of hot water.

01:15:18.059 --> 01:15:20.979
The problem was that,
in subsequent conversations

01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:26.860
with Los Alamos security people,
he had told very evasive, vague

01:15:26.901 --> 01:15:30.697
accounts of this conversation,
one after another.

01:15:31.906 --> 01:15:34.075
And when they confronted
Oppenheimer

01:15:34.117 --> 01:15:37.370
with these evasive versions,
they asked him,

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:38.872
"Why did you do this?

01:15:38.913 --> 01:15:41.916
Why wouldn't
you have been forthright?"

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:44.252
He said, "I was an idiot."

01:15:44.294 --> 01:15:48.757
And in a sense,
he sealed his own fate then.

01:15:51.217 --> 01:15:53.762
RHODES:
He fell apart.

01:15:53.803 --> 01:15:57.265
He tried to testify,
but he really fell apart.

01:15:59.017 --> 01:16:02.812
BIRD: He's having almost
another nervous breakdown,

01:16:02.854 --> 01:16:05.357
like what he went through
as a young man.

01:16:05.398 --> 01:16:10.737
He's oddly stoic,
like he was in the icehouse

01:16:10.779 --> 01:16:13.615
when he was a young boy
being tormented

01:16:13.656 --> 01:16:16.159
by his fellow summer campers.

01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:22.957
He's resigned and
not really defending himself.

01:16:24.334 --> 01:16:28.672
One person who sort of put the
nails in his coffin, of course,

01:16:28.713 --> 01:16:30.840
was Edward Teller.

01:16:33.176 --> 01:16:35.512
HERKEN: Teller testified
against Oppenheimer.

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:38.807
He said that he thought
he would feel better

01:16:38.848 --> 01:16:40.392
if the security of the country

01:16:40.433 --> 01:16:44.104
were in other hands
than Oppenheimer's.

01:16:44.145 --> 01:16:48.358
And one of the scientists who
was close to Oppenheimer said

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:51.695
it was a matter of not only
stabbing Oppenheimer in the back

01:16:51.736 --> 01:16:53.822
but twisting the blade.

01:16:55.573 --> 01:16:56.991
RHODES:
As he was leaving,

01:16:57.033 --> 01:16:58.743
he went up to shake
Oppenheimer's hand

01:16:58.785 --> 01:17:01.162
and said, "I'm sorry."

01:17:02.497 --> 01:17:06.793
And Oppenheimer looked him
in the eye and said,

01:17:06.835 --> 01:17:09.546
"Edward,
after what you just said,

01:17:09.587 --> 01:17:12.340
I don't know what that means."

01:17:13.675 --> 01:17:17.220
NOLAN: He was obviously
a very, very brilliant man,

01:17:17.262 --> 01:17:20.849
but I think
he may have underestimated

01:17:20.890 --> 01:17:24.561
the power of the establishment,
the machine,

01:17:24.602 --> 01:17:26.646
and the inability
of one individual

01:17:26.688 --> 01:17:29.065
to stand against that.

01:17:29.858 --> 01:17:33.194
BIRD:
The result was to be expected.

01:17:33.945 --> 01:17:35.989
(fanfare plays)

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:38.033
TV ANNOUNCER:
Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer,

01:17:38.074 --> 01:17:40.160
the famous scientist
whose suspension this week

01:17:40.201 --> 01:17:43.705
by the Atomic Energy Commission
surprised the nation.

01:17:43.747 --> 01:17:48.043
They voted to strip Oppenheimer
of his security clearance.

01:17:51.338 --> 01:17:55.258
This was front-page news in the
newspapers across the country.

01:17:56.885 --> 01:17:59.137
That he had recommended
communists

01:17:59.179 --> 01:18:01.181
who are working
the A-bomb, H-bomb plans.

01:18:01.222 --> 01:18:04.184
His wife, uh,
admittedly was, uh,

01:18:04.225 --> 01:18:07.020
an official of
the Communist Party,

01:18:07.062 --> 01:18:09.230
uh, brother
a very active communist.

01:18:10.523 --> 01:18:14.110
BIRD:
He became a political pariah.

01:18:14.152 --> 01:18:15.862
KAKU:
And that sent a chill

01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:19.240
through
the scientific community.

01:18:19.282 --> 01:18:22.285
If they could take down
the most famous atomic scientist

01:18:22.327 --> 01:18:26.206
on the planet Earth,
then we're all vulnerable.

01:18:27.749 --> 01:18:31.044
BIRD: It sent
a really nefarious message

01:18:31.086 --> 01:18:32.962
to all working scientists

01:18:33.004 --> 01:18:38.385
to beware of weighing in
on political issues.

01:18:40.553 --> 01:18:44.766
And this is a terrible thing
because we need their expertise.

01:18:44.808 --> 01:18:48.520
And yet the Oppenheimer trial

01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:51.064
made that difficult.

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.905
RHODES:
After the security trial,

01:18:58.947 --> 01:19:01.866
Oppenheimer was never
the same guy again.

01:19:02.992 --> 01:19:06.121
He was kind of
a hollow man after that.

01:19:07.288 --> 01:19:09.165
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER:
What we say inside the family is

01:19:09.207 --> 01:19:11.459
it hurt his feelings.

01:19:15.171 --> 01:19:18.925
He didn't like it,
but he didn't talk about it.

01:19:18.967 --> 01:19:21.553
He never made one statement
about it publicly.

01:19:24.139 --> 01:19:26.641
He never asked for an apology,

01:19:26.683 --> 01:19:29.811
and he retreated back into
where he came from.

01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:33.606
BIRD: He still kept his job
at Princeton,

01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:37.360
but he wasn't doing
any more physics.

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:39.738
These were kind of sad years.

01:19:39.779 --> 01:19:42.198
MURROW: And Professor Einstein
is still here, too, isn't he?

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.828
Oh, yeah. Indeed he is.
Uh, indeed he is. Uh...

01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:49.330
Does he ever call you up
on the telephone?

01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:50.248
Hmm, sometimes.

01:19:50.290 --> 01:19:52.292
I think he... he calls me,

01:19:52.334 --> 01:19:54.210
uh, when he reads
in the newspapers

01:19:54.252 --> 01:19:56.087
something about me
that he doesn't like,

01:19:56.129 --> 01:19:58.131
and he calls me up and-and says,

01:19:58.173 --> 01:20:00.175
"That's all right.
That's just right."

01:20:00.216 --> 01:20:04.095
SHERWIN:
He had lost his fighting spirit.

01:20:04.137 --> 01:20:08.475
He would have nothing
to do with commenting

01:20:08.516 --> 01:20:13.480
on any of the issues of the day
related to nuclear weapons.

01:20:13.521 --> 01:20:16.441
MAN: Dr. Oppenheimer, could you
tell us what your thoughts are

01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:20.028
about what our atomic policy
should be?

01:20:20.070 --> 01:20:22.322
No, I-I can't do that.

01:20:22.364 --> 01:20:26.534
I'm not... not close enough
to the facts,

01:20:26.576 --> 01:20:28.161
and I'm not close enough

01:20:28.203 --> 01:20:32.874
to the thoughts of those
who are worrying about it.

01:20:34.459 --> 01:20:37.712
RHODES:
Hans Bethe told me once that,

01:20:37.754 --> 01:20:40.173
"Oppenheimer was smarter than
any of the rest of us."

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:43.468
He didn't win a Nobel Prize.

01:20:43.510 --> 01:20:46.304
How could this man,
who evidently outshone

01:20:46.346 --> 01:20:48.890
some of the greatest physicists
of the 20th century,

01:20:48.932 --> 01:20:54.020
not have been more successful
in his line of work-- physics--

01:20:54.062 --> 01:20:55.814
than he was?

01:20:55.855 --> 01:20:57.565
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER:
You can't talk about Oppenheimer

01:20:57.607 --> 01:21:00.360
when you're not
talking about his science.

01:21:00.402 --> 01:21:02.028
That was the part of his life.

01:21:02.070 --> 01:21:03.738
When he talks about
what he loves,

01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:07.200
it was that human thing
of passing knowledge around.

01:21:07.242 --> 01:21:09.202
This is negative particles,

01:21:09.244 --> 01:21:13.123
neutral, doubly charged,
positive and positive...

01:21:13.164 --> 01:21:15.125
CHARLES OPPENHEIMER:
His work on black holes

01:21:15.166 --> 01:21:17.293
should have earned him
a Nobel Prize.

01:21:19.629 --> 01:21:24.551
SHERWIN: In 1939, Oppenheimer
wrote the first paper

01:21:24.592 --> 01:21:30.390
identifying the idea of
collapsing stars, a black hole.

01:21:30.432 --> 01:21:34.352
So, black holes
was his original idea.

01:21:34.394 --> 01:21:36.604
I mean, that's quite amazing.

01:21:38.064 --> 01:21:39.399
And if a real black hole

01:21:39.441 --> 01:21:42.027
had been identified
before he died...

01:21:43.153 --> 01:21:46.990
...he probably would have won
a Nobel Prize for that work.

01:21:49.242 --> 01:21:51.745
BIRD:
In 1966,

01:21:51.786 --> 01:21:55.290
he was diagnosed
with esophageal cancer.

01:21:55.331 --> 01:21:58.460
All that smoking over the years
had gotten to him.

01:21:58.501 --> 01:22:01.004
(clock ticking)

01:22:01.046 --> 01:22:04.716
And he died in early '67.

01:22:07.427 --> 01:22:09.387
Oppenheimer's life story,

01:22:09.429 --> 01:22:11.639
it's the story
of the 20th century.

01:22:11.681 --> 01:22:15.477
It's the story of
our nuclear age

01:22:15.518 --> 01:22:17.979
that we're still living with,

01:22:18.021 --> 01:22:20.648
and that's a story
that is unfinished.

01:22:20.690 --> 01:22:22.108
Will always be unfinished.

01:22:22.150 --> 01:22:24.361
(explosion rumbling)

01:22:26.571 --> 01:22:28.198
ELSE:
We have his bomb.

01:22:28.239 --> 01:22:30.492
His bomb is with us.

01:22:30.533 --> 01:22:33.328
And we can debate his membership
in the Communist Party

01:22:33.370 --> 01:22:35.455
or we can debate the ethics

01:22:35.497 --> 01:22:38.583
of bombing civilians
at Hiroshima until we drop,

01:22:38.625 --> 01:22:41.044
but the fact is that we have
nuclear weapons.

01:22:43.254 --> 01:22:45.090
That's the legacy.

01:22:45.131 --> 01:22:50.053
And controlling those weapons,
it's a never-ending struggle.

01:22:51.012 --> 01:22:53.223
(explosion rumbling)

01:22:57.852 --> 01:23:01.564
It was so horrible
with a baby bomb.

01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:05.485
Now they have so much
more lethal nuclear weapon.

01:23:07.612 --> 01:23:09.364
OPPENHEIMER:
There is much talk about

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:11.491
getting rid of atomic weapons.

01:23:12.283 --> 01:23:16.204
I have a deep sympathy
with that.

01:23:17.330 --> 01:23:23.420
TAMURA: Please, let's try
to find common ground.

01:23:26.089 --> 01:23:31.302
I'm sure if Oppie was alive
today, he would agree with me.

01:23:32.053 --> 01:23:33.763
MAN:
...two, one.

01:23:33.805 --> 01:23:37.475
OPPENHEIMER:
But we mustn't fool ourselves.

01:23:37.517 --> 01:23:39.644
The world is not
going to be the same

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:43.189
no matter what we do
with atomic bombs,

01:23:43.231 --> 01:23:48.611
because the knowledge of how to
make them cannot be exorcized.

01:23:49.404 --> 01:23:51.614
-(insects chirring)
-(wind whistling softly)

01:23:53.742 --> 01:23:56.578
JUDY WOODRUFF:
Physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer

01:23:56.619 --> 01:24:01.374
is perhaps best known as
the father of the atomic bomb.

01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:03.043
As time has passed,

01:24:03.084 --> 01:24:07.130
there are some new assessments
of his role in history.

01:24:08.131 --> 01:24:10.300
In late 2022,
the Department of Energy

01:24:10.342 --> 01:24:16.389
decided to vacate the decision
to have the security hearings.

01:24:17.849 --> 01:24:20.060
The national tragedy
is that this hearing,

01:24:20.101 --> 01:24:24.189
this McCarthy-era witch hunt,
materialized in the first place.

01:24:24.981 --> 01:24:27.067
That type of thing
is not supposed to happen

01:24:27.108 --> 01:24:28.902
in a country like this.

01:24:28.943 --> 01:24:33.490
This is such an important
and long overdue step.

01:24:34.741 --> 01:24:36.993
But at the same time,
it's kind of sad,

01:24:37.035 --> 01:24:39.662
because this is something
that J. Robert Oppenheimer

01:24:39.704 --> 01:24:42.332
will not get to experience
personally.

01:24:44.417 --> 01:24:46.961
OPPENHEIMER:
Science has profoundly altered

01:24:47.003 --> 01:24:50.090
the conditions of man's life,

01:24:50.131 --> 01:24:54.427
both materially and in ways
of the spirit as well.

01:24:57.222 --> 01:24:59.140
NYE: I think we're still
talking about Oppenheimer

01:24:59.182 --> 01:25:01.768
because he was so influential.

01:25:01.810 --> 01:25:05.146
We have this respect
and fear of science.

01:25:06.815 --> 01:25:10.402
And Oppenheimer represented
both sides of that, for sure.

01:25:11.653 --> 01:25:15.156
NOLAN: Unquestionably,
he changed the world.

01:25:15.198 --> 01:25:16.366
And he changed
the world forever.

01:25:16.408 --> 01:25:17.951
There's no going back.

01:25:18.743 --> 01:25:22.205
But we know that as long as men
are free to ask what they will,

01:25:22.247 --> 01:25:26.376
free to say what they think,
free to think what they must,

01:25:26.418 --> 01:25:28.962
science will never regress,

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:32.590
and freedom itself
will never be wholly lost.

01:25:36.386 --> 01:25:38.638
