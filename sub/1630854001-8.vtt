I'm heading to Chapman Hills.

Kyle has me reinspecting a place
I was at a week and a half ago.

That's not right.

Hey.

00:46.068 --> 00:48.140
Hey, Sam.

00:48.207 --> 00:50.678
You sent Jeanette
back to a place

00:50.745 --> 00:52.883
in Chapman Hills
that she was just at.

00:52.949 --> 00:54.419
Yeah.

00:54.485 --> 00:56.189
And...

00:56.255 --> 00:59.095
you sent me back
to Taverna Petraki.

00:59.161 --> 01:01.199
Things get reinspected, Sam.

01:01.266 --> 01:04.138
But they have to wait
their turn.

01:05.074 --> 01:06.610
Current wait time
in Lincoln County

01:06.677 --> 01:08.847
for reinspection
is almost eight months.

01:10.317 --> 01:12.421
(sighs) Sam...

01:12.488 --> 01:15.928
when you have my job,
you can do my job,

01:15.995 --> 01:19.168
but for now, why don't you worry
about doing your own job?

01:19.234 --> 01:20.738
Which you're good at,

01:20.805 --> 01:24.345
except for how you talk
to your boss.

02:43.671 --> 02:45.440
It irritates me.

02:46.375 --> 02:49.348
My daughter-in-law couldn't take
a simple compliment--

or Ezra couldn't--

was your compliment?

02:58.600 --> 03:00.705
(sighs) I told her she made

03:00.771 --> 03:02.909
the best kosher steak
I'd ever had.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.345
I complimented her cooking.

03:04.411 --> 03:08.219
By saying she made the best
kosher steak.

03:13.898 --> 03:17.204
Is there some difference
in kosher steaks?

03:17.271 --> 03:19.308
Yes. Yes, I get it.

03:19.375 --> 03:21.145
It could read as
a backhanded compliment.

03:21.212 --> 03:23.684
Anything could be read
as a backhanded compliment.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.487
It was a good steak,
and I said so.

03:25.555 --> 03:27.224
It was a good "kosher" steak.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.362
Okay. Okay, fine.

03:29.428 --> 03:32.268
Yeah, I-- You know,
I'm in an environment

03:32.334 --> 03:34.071
where I should realize
that everybody

03:34.137 --> 03:35.809
is sensitive and defensive,

03:35.875 --> 03:38.581
and if I'm a little more alert,
I just say "steak."

03:38.648 --> 03:41.654
I should've just said "steak."

-ALAN: Mm.

04:54.165 --> 04:56.302
His fucking yeshiva,

04:56.369 --> 04:58.273
in Israel.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.876
(sighs)

04:59.943 --> 05:02.648
After college,
Shoshana's in medical school,

05:02.715 --> 05:06.222
and he has to go to this
goddamn Orthodox yeshiva

05:06.289 --> 05:08.494
in Jerusalem. Fine.

05:08.561 --> 05:11.600
His second year,
Beth has a conference there,

05:11.666 --> 05:14.806
so we figure I'll come along,
and we'll visit Ezra.

05:14.873 --> 05:18.548
We get there, before we
see him at the yeshiva,

05:18.614 --> 05:21.954
he sends, uh,
a set of instructions

05:22.021 --> 05:25.628
to her on how she is
supposed to dress,

05:25.695 --> 05:29.502
like Beth doesn't know how
to dress around Orthodox Jews.

05:29.569 --> 05:32.942
So, she covers her hair,
every inch of her flesh.

05:33.009 --> 05:36.482
He takes us to meet the rebbe.
Forget your stereotypes.

05:36.550 --> 05:39.122
Young, hulking guy.

05:39.188 --> 05:41.059
Could've played football.

05:41.125 --> 05:43.463
He tells us that Ezra

05:43.531 --> 05:46.035
is a real ben torah.

05:46.102 --> 05:47.906
And Ezra's just beaming,

05:47.972 --> 05:51.312
like this is the best compliment
he's ever gotten.

05:51.378 --> 05:53.349
And the contribution?

05:53.416 --> 05:55.487
Ah.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.692
I was supposed to make
a contribution,

05:57.759 --> 05:59.361
right there in the office.

05:59.428 --> 06:01.231
This was made clear to me.

06:01.298 --> 06:04.940
So, I write a check for $1,000.

06:05.007 --> 06:07.378
But then...

06:07.444 --> 06:09.649
we're in the driveway,

06:09.716 --> 06:12.589
his mother is literally
dying in the house,

06:12.655 --> 06:15.093
and he says I don't respect him.

06:15.159 --> 06:18.633
I don't respect his choices.

06:18.700 --> 06:21.806
That I gave Shoshana, whatever,

06:21.873 --> 06:24.613
$40,000 a year
for medical school,

06:24.680 --> 06:28.152
and I gave his yeshiva
a paltry $1,000.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.825
Is yeshiva free?

06:30.891 --> 06:33.029
He never asked me to pay for it.

06:33.096 --> 06:35.233
He got a job and
a partial scholarship.

06:35.300 --> 06:38.707
-He asked you for a donation.
-And I made one.

06:39.643 --> 06:41.011
Do you know what it felt like

06:41.078 --> 06:43.483
to walk through
that yeshiva with Beth?

06:43.551 --> 06:45.487
Imagine if your son

06:45.555 --> 06:48.861
became a Scientologist,

06:48.928 --> 06:50.832
and you had to walk
through the...

06:50.898 --> 06:54.539
Scientology center with him,

06:54.605 --> 06:57.144
and at the end,
you gave a donation

06:57.210 --> 06:59.883
because you wanted
to make a gesture,

06:59.949 --> 07:02.522
and he took it as an insult?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.927
Alan,

07:04.993 --> 07:07.598
if you could talk
to Ezra right now,

07:07.665 --> 07:09.969
what would you say to him?

07:12.675 --> 07:15.581
"Ezra, you broke up our family.

07:17.852 --> 07:19.656
"You thought you had
all the answers.

07:19.723 --> 07:22.227
"You were so righteous.

07:22.293 --> 07:25.200
"You humiliated your mother.

07:25.267 --> 07:28.508
"You devastated her.

07:28.574 --> 07:30.210
"I want to s...

07:30.277 --> 07:31.780
"I want to say you killed her,

07:31.846 --> 07:34.653
"but I know that's not true.

07:34.719 --> 07:37.457
"All your mother wanted,
all she asked

07:37.525 --> 07:40.129
"was to be able to hold
the hands of both her children

07:40.196 --> 07:44.071
"in her dying moment,
and even this, you could not do.

07:44.138 --> 07:46.242
"Your way of looking
at the world

07:46.309 --> 07:48.513
"had to be the only way.

Everyone else is wrong."

Ezra was obstinate,

08:01.573 --> 08:03.443
from the time
he was a little boy.

08:03.510 --> 08:05.147
I remember you talking about it.

Oh. I'm sorry to hear that.

26:37.102 --> 26:39.440
I was thinking
about your question,

26:39.508 --> 26:43.014
and I'd be glad to do it,
to be your therapist.

26:44.651 --> 26:47.022

34:55.132 --> 34:58.404

35:04.016 --> 35:07.489
about the Frenchman,
the Englishman, and the Jew

35:07.556 --> 35:09.694
who were sentenced to death?

35:09.761 --> 35:13.903
Oh, oh, no... no.

35:13.969 --> 35:16.074
Three men

35:16.140 --> 35:18.111
are sentenced to death,
and they are

35:18.177 --> 35:20.381
told that they can choose

35:20.448 --> 35:22.720
their form of execution.

35:24.323 --> 35:25.859
The Frenchman says,

35:25.926 --> 35:28.365
"I choose the guillotine."

35:28.431 --> 35:30.268
So, they build a guillotine,

35:30.334 --> 35:33.174
and they chop off his head.

35:34.443 --> 35:36.982
The Englishman says,

35:37.048 --> 35:40.288
"I choose the firing squad."

35:40.355 --> 35:42.259
So, they get together
a firing squad,

35:42.326 --> 35:44.463
and they shoot him.

35:46.535 --> 35:48.337
Now, the Jew is left...

35:48.404 --> 35:51.611
I went to see the psychologist
from my high school.

35:53.381 --> 35:56.287
He said that he would be
my therapist,

35:56.354 --> 35:58.625
starting next week.

36:03.434 --> 36:06.140
...and the Jew says,

36:06.207 --> 36:08.377
"Old age."
