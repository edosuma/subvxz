WEBVTT

00:02.680 --> 00:04.399
Why go halfway across town
to a chemist?

00:04.400 --> 00:06.439
Well, maybe Eddie's supplying him
with PEDs.

00:06.440 --> 00:09.559
Owned by
Lionel Cartwright, no priors.

00:09.560 --> 00:11.599
That bottle is a critical piece
of evidence

00:11.600 --> 00:13.800
in a national investigation.

00:14.920 --> 00:18.920
They found the drug that Tyler was
on. There's grounds for an appeal.

00:20.800 --> 00:22.679
- Lucy...
- It stays between us.

00:22.680 --> 00:24.200
Absolutely.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.719
Let me go!

00:28.720 --> 00:29.719
Get the fuck off!

00:29.720 --> 00:32.198
Why don't you take your clothes off?
We can have some fun, yeah?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.799
If you could accelerate this
matter against Flynn Pearce,

00:34.800 --> 00:36.399
sex with a minor?

00:36.400 --> 00:38.079
And the reason you need it
accelerated?

00:38.080 --> 00:39.439
Confidential, of course.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.999
NCC, Bonnie Mahesh speaking.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.279
Bonnie, Owen Mitchell.

00:42.280 --> 00:44.599
Maybe we can catch up
at the end of the day.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.639
This is Darren. Richard's a lawyer.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.719
- Darren's in concrete.
- Concrete?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.199
Darren Faulkes.

00:50.200 --> 00:52.799
He's been a major person of interest
in about a dozen inquiries.

00:52.800 --> 00:54.079
Could never nail him.

00:54.080 --> 00:56.679
We're talking about
very hard people.

00:56.680 --> 01:00.839
And I can help you with them if you
just please give me some names.

01:00.840 --> 01:02.839
Did you know that
the morning Clay died,

01:02.840 --> 01:05.279
he was about to tell us
who runs that syndicate?

01:05.280 --> 01:07.159
No, I didn't.

01:07.160 --> 01:09.799
One particular call from Clay
Nelson's mystery visitor went to

01:09.800 --> 01:13.095
Maxine's burner the same day
Oliver's wide wasn't called.

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:42.160 --> 01:43.799
Adelaide, hot and 36...

01:43.800 --> 01:45.827
Liam, get your foot off the couch.

01:45.829 --> 01:47.309
I'm on my last shoe.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.479
Alright, Em, that's it -
outside to the middle,

01:50.480 --> 01:51.759
other side to the middle.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.119
- Good.
- Can you do it?

01:53.120 --> 01:55.479
No. If you want long hair,
you have to practise your plaits.

01:55.480 --> 01:56.639
Mum, look, it's Graham.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.079
...placed into receivership.

01:58.080 --> 02:01.719
Pax Chairman Mr Graham King
is being investigated by

02:01.720 --> 02:05.679
the Australian Securities Commission
for breaches of the company code.

02:05.680 --> 02:09.038
Mr King is accused of issuing
a fraudulent prospectus,

02:09.039 --> 02:12.359
misrepresenting the financial
status of Pax Car Rentals,

02:12.360 --> 02:14.478
an offence that carries a maximum...

02:15.320 --> 02:17.759
- Is he in trouble?
- He'll sort it out.

02:17.760 --> 02:21.199
Can you finish my hair now?

02:21.200 --> 02:22.319
Bonnie.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.839
Speed those kiddies to school
and get yourself to work quick as.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.239
Have we found Maxine Reynolds?

02:26.240 --> 02:27.239
No sign of the Big M,

02:27.240 --> 02:30.358
but you'll never guess
who's turned up wanting a chat.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.999
Well, where do you want to start?
You ask me, I ask you?

02:34.000 --> 02:35.919
I'll start, Mr Faulkes,
by reminding you

02:35.920 --> 02:39.450
there are serious penalties
if you're here to waste our time.

02:40.320 --> 02:43.679
The young bowler who took
his own life, Oliver Pittman,

02:43.680 --> 02:47.119
boy didn't bowl that wide
of his own volition.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.799
Someone in the stand
gave him a signal,

02:49.800 --> 02:51.519
probably when the odds
went from here to Mars.

02:51.520 --> 02:54.359
Yes, we've already come to
that conclusion ourselves, so...

02:54.360 --> 02:57.719
But you don't know
who gave him the signal.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.599
I do.

02:59.600 --> 03:00.959
Maxine Reynolds.

03:00.960 --> 03:03.159
And what evidence do you have
for Ms Reynolds' involvement?

03:03.160 --> 03:05.519
On the day of the A20 match,

03:05.520 --> 03:10.759
she wore a flashy, colourful scarf,
sat to the left of the players' box

03:10.760 --> 03:12.559
and waited for
a particular phone call.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.679
When that call came,
she took off the scarf,

03:14.680 --> 03:16.759
gave it a wave.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.559
Very next ball,

03:18.560 --> 03:22.919
young Pittman bowls that uncalled
wide and all hell breaks loose.

03:22.920 --> 03:24.599
How do you know all this?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.080
Well, she told me.

03:27.200 --> 03:28.800
We're old mates.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.199
Not very matey
to volunteer her name

03:33.200 --> 03:34.679
to the National Crime Commission.

03:34.680 --> 03:36.800
I'm no fool, sweetie.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.319
I knew the moment
that Graham King

03:40.320 --> 03:41.879
told the world to save his own arse

03:41.880 --> 03:43.799
that I topped up
Nate Baldwin's salary

03:43.800 --> 03:46.999
that you would be pegging me
as your Mr Big.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.759
Look, I may have bent the rules
a little

03:49.760 --> 03:51.639
to help my football team along...

03:51.640 --> 03:55.840
...but Maxine,
she's a whole other ball game.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.439
I don't trust him.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.439
Darren Faulkes is not of
impeccable character, granted...

04:01.440 --> 04:03.239
He's most likely trying to steer us
away from him.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.319
Well, however insidious
his motivations,

04:05.320 --> 04:07.599
his evidence does fit with
what we know about Maxine.

04:07.600 --> 04:10.424
Don't you think his timing's
slightly suspicious?

04:10.600 --> 04:12.319
I mean,
just after Maxine disappears,

04:12.320 --> 04:14.799
Darren pops up offering
the final nail in her coffin.

04:14.800 --> 04:15.999
She was at the A20 match.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.759
Where she received
a call on her burner phone

04:17.760 --> 04:19.639
seconds before Oliver bowled
that wide.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.399
And she's linked to
all our significant POIs.

04:21.399 --> 04:24.079
If this evidence is confirmed, she's
no longer just linked to this world,

04:24.080 --> 04:25.079
she's directly involved.

04:25.080 --> 04:27.359
Or Maxine's a perfect fall guy
for Darren,

04:27.360 --> 04:29.039
especially if she's not here to
defend herself.

04:29.040 --> 04:30.639
So Maxine's dead or guilty.

04:30.640 --> 04:33.119
Talk about damned if you do,
damned if you don't.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.650
I'm going to the DPP.
Lina's prepping Pearl.

04:36.680 --> 04:40.559
Janet...
did you see the news this morning?

04:40.560 --> 04:43.160
Yeah.

04:56.880 --> 04:59.040
Brief time!

05:06.080 --> 05:07.839
- Shall we go to Rosie's?
- OK, cool.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.199
- Geoff!
- Yeah?

05:09.200 --> 05:11.399
Have you got any room
on your dance card?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.839
Samba? Rumba? New Vogue?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.039
Sex with a minor.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
A tricky style.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.879
Why don't you want to defend
Mr Flynn Pearce?

05:23.880 --> 05:27.057
Nate Baldwin's appeal's pending.
I'm up to my eyeballs.

05:28.040 --> 05:29.560
Sure, why not?

05:43.600 --> 05:45.959
When you stayed
with Flynn at his place,

05:45.960 --> 05:47.599
did he have sex with you?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.599
Yeah.

05:48.600 --> 05:50.039
What sort of sex?

05:50.040 --> 05:52.079
You know, sex.

05:52.080 --> 05:54.319
Did he have vaginal intercourse
with you?

05:54.320 --> 05:56.359
Yeah.

05:56.360 --> 05:57.679
How many times?

05:57.680 --> 05:59.719
I don't know. Lots.

05:59.720 --> 06:02.399
- Most nights?
- Yeah.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.719
Did he have oral sex with you?

06:04.720 --> 06:06.519
Sometimes, yeah.

06:06.520 --> 06:09.759
When he had oral sex,
was it you on him, or him on you?

06:09.760 --> 06:12.290
Flynn's gonna love you
asking him this shit.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.839
He doesn't have to say anything.

06:14.840 --> 06:17.679
How's that fair?
It's a common strategy.

06:17.680 --> 06:19.119
It helps prevent the accused person

06:19.120 --> 06:20.679
from potentially
incriminating themselves.

06:20.680 --> 06:22.039
So, it protects him?

06:22.040 --> 06:23.399
Well, we call it
a right to silence.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.719
A right to... He was arrested.
How does he have any rights at all?

06:25.720 --> 06:28.319
We, the prosecution,
have to make our case against him.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.850
We have to prove
he did these things to you.

06:32.400 --> 06:34.159
Yeah, right, so it's all on me.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.679
Flynn's lawyer will try to imply

06:35.680 --> 06:38.319
that you're misremembering
what Flynn did to you.

06:38.320 --> 06:39.359
Misremember?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.119
Well, that your recollections
are imperfect.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.709
He fucked me a lot.
How could I not remember?

06:47.000 --> 06:49.040
You mean they'll say I'm lying.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.279
Pearl, um... let's have a break.

06:56.280 --> 06:58.359
I'll get us a drink.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.840
Fuck.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.120
You did well. Back in a sec.

07:11.400 --> 07:14.999
I don't think it's in Pearl's
best interests to proceed with this.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.319
Why not?

07:16.320 --> 07:18.199
Because she's finding it
hard enough already.

07:18.200 --> 07:20.479
What's going to happen when she's
crossed for three hours straight?

07:20.480 --> 07:21.879
You're preparing her for that.

07:21.880 --> 07:23.839
There is evidence
that Flynn had sex with her?

07:23.840 --> 07:25.399
Yeah, but we only have
her statement.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.279
Then it's your duty to
prosecute him.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.679
Janet, you're her support person,
not her counsel.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.039
And I'm supporting her
by ensuring Flynn is convicted.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.519
Not if she goes through all this

07:33.520 --> 07:35.439
just to see Flynn get
a community order.

07:35.440 --> 07:37.839
I've prosecuted a lot of sex crimes.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.879
The judge is likely to regard
his actions as non-coercive

07:40.880 --> 07:42.799
and nonviolent.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.799
You've seen how
a lot of these trials end.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.359
- Why are you pushing so hard?
- She has no-one.

07:47.360 --> 07:50.919
Her brother's dead, her mum's
a drunk, her stepfather's predatory.

07:50.920 --> 07:52.399
Social services are useless.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.679
If you and I, the law, aren't on her
side advocating for her safety,

07:55.680 --> 07:57.160
who is?

08:17.720 --> 08:19.359
Thank you, for the ball.

08:19.360 --> 08:22.599
Well... I think you've chosen well
for court.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.519
Isn't that gonna be a laugh.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.879
That, um, Lina chick gives me
a headache.

08:27.880 --> 08:29.159
Look, it's going to be tough,

08:29.160 --> 08:31.759
but I believe in you and I'll be
there the whole time, alright?

08:31.760 --> 08:33.719
Yep.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.078
These are good, too.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.879
Just don't know why
you have to buy them

08:36.880 --> 08:38.159
with rips already in them.

08:38.159 --> 08:39.640
Yeah.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.119
Need something for your head?
I can get it.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.079
Yeah, there's tablets in the
bedroom. That would be good.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.479
- OK.
- Thank you.

08:46.480 --> 08:48.440
No worries.

09:03.560 --> 09:06.600
Pearl, um... where'd you get these?

09:07.880 --> 09:08.919
Flynn.

09:08.920 --> 09:11.719
Flynn gave you this Oxycodone?

09:11.720 --> 09:14.309
I grabbed a bunch of stuff
from his bathroom.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.319
It's the same.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.679
Identical batch number as the pack
left for Clay to kill himself with.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.279
I bet Flynn was the source. We know
he loves to deal a drug or two.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.879
It wasn't him who threatened Clay.

09:25.880 --> 09:29.800
No, it was our mystery man.
Who Flynn Pearce knows.

09:38.240 --> 09:40.359
So, let's get an ID. Pull Flynn in.

09:40.360 --> 09:41.919
Not yet.
We should wait.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.759
The closer his court case gets,

09:43.760 --> 09:46.039
the more chance we've got
of him giving us something,

09:46.040 --> 09:48.279
if he thinks we can help him
reduce his sentence.

09:48.280 --> 09:50.439
He's definitely going down?

09:50.440 --> 09:53.359
Well, Pearl's 15, he's 28.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.959
Unless the jury can't add up.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.839
How did it go with Lina?

09:58.160 --> 10:00.519
Sorry, that's Bonnie.
I'll call you back.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.719
Bonnie.

10:01.720 --> 10:04.919
So, a Dorothy Gale
just booked a flight to Perth.

10:04.920 --> 10:06.559
The name on Maxine's burner phone.

10:06.560 --> 10:07.639
Yep.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.559
Departs in an hour.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.999
She hasn't checked in yet.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.160
And hang on.

10:15.720 --> 10:17.519
From Perth, a Maxine Reynolds

10:17.520 --> 10:19.599
is booked on an international flight
to Cape Town.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.879
- One way.
- We're heading there now.

10:28.200 --> 10:29.199
How's it going?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.879
Maxine Reynolds' eTag just pinged

10:30.880 --> 10:32.998
going into priority pick-up
car park.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.384
OK, you take the right.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.879
Imagine the pile of parking fines
she's gonna cop.

10:58.880 --> 11:00.119
That's the least of her worries.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.799
Bianca, she can't get on that plane,
alright?

11:01.800 --> 11:05.389
We've only got a notice to attend
with no outstanding charges.

11:11.760 --> 11:14.584
- What's happening?
- No, I can't see her.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.679
Got her. Get to the lift!
Federal Police! Stop!

11:18.680 --> 11:20.759
Shit. Police!

11:20.760 --> 11:22.399
- Stop!
- Fuckin' get off me!

11:22.400 --> 11:24.959
- Stay where you are!
- Maxine! Stop!

11:24.960 --> 11:27.159
Maxine Reynolds! Federal Police!

11:27.160 --> 11:29.079
Get out of my fuckin' way!

11:29.080 --> 11:30.119
Police!

11:30.120 --> 11:31.199
- Hey!
- Grab her!

11:31.200 --> 11:32.879
Ooh! Jesus!

11:32.880 --> 11:34.079
Stop!

11:34.080 --> 11:37.800
Fucking get off me! Get off me!

11:39.600 --> 11:41.639
What was your involvement
in the betting scam

11:41.640 --> 11:43.817
that led to Oliver Pittman's suicide?

11:45.280 --> 11:47.039
Whoever was behind that scam

11:47.040 --> 11:51.599
had access to Clay Nelson,
Oliver Pittman and Nate Baldwin.

11:51.600 --> 11:53.280
Someone like you.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.079
I didn't do anything.

11:56.080 --> 11:58.199
You gave the signal
at the A20 match

11:58.200 --> 11:59.839
that destroyed a young man's life,

11:59.840 --> 12:02.159
contributed to Clay Nelson's death.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.799
All I did was take off my scarf.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.639
Which is ironic,
because from where I'm standing

12:05.640 --> 12:07.119
it looks like you're in this
up to your neck.

12:07.120 --> 12:08.839
- I didn't do anything.
- Then why run away?

12:08.840 --> 12:10.880
Why try and leave the country?

12:16.800 --> 12:19.320
He'll kill me if I stay.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.800
Who's he, Maxine?
Who's behind this scam?

12:29.600 --> 12:30.799
Ms Reynolds?

12:30.800 --> 12:32.320
Darren.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.840
Darren bloody Faulkes.

12:39.640 --> 12:43.052
OK, what's the nature of your
relationship with Mr Faulkes?

12:48.320 --> 12:49.799
I've known him on and off for years.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.800
In a social sense? What, business?

12:53.120 --> 12:54.840
Romantic?

12:57.640 --> 12:59.240
You're lovers, aren't you?

13:03.440 --> 13:04.599
Well, on and off.

13:04.600 --> 13:08.542
So through you, he did get access
to Clay Nelson and Oliver Pittman.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.648
Well, at the beginning, I...

13:14.000 --> 13:15.359
...I thought this was
just about money.

13:15.360 --> 13:16.679
No-one was getting hurt.

13:16.680 --> 13:19.039
I mean, even when Oliver...

13:19.040 --> 13:21.039
...and then...

13:21.040 --> 13:23.239
When Clay died I tried really hard

13:23.240 --> 13:25.200
not to believe that Darren...

13:26.600 --> 13:30.759
But he did, you see,
and now he wants my help,

13:30.760 --> 13:33.919
again, and all I ever did
was get 10 grand,

13:33.920 --> 13:35.759
two dead clients
and a whole lot of grief.

13:35.760 --> 13:37.399
He wants your help for what?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.999
I don't know.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.479
I don't know!

13:40.480 --> 13:41.879
What does he want you to do?

13:41.880 --> 13:44.479
Just give him names
from my client list.

13:44.480 --> 13:46.799
I smiled. I said, "Sure, Daz.

13:46.800 --> 13:48.959
"Sure, Daz." I gave him the names,
I walked away.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.439
But I knew then that I had to get
the fuck out of Dodge

13:51.440 --> 13:52.919
or I'd end up under a bus too.

13:52.920 --> 13:55.279
OK, has Mr Faulkes made
specific threats against you?

13:55.280 --> 13:57.279
No, but he'll know.
He'll find out about this.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.519
Find out about what?

13:58.520 --> 14:00.679
That I've been
talking to you lot.

14:00.680 --> 14:03.040
Just like he found out about Clay.

14:05.280 --> 14:07.599
Alright, Ms Reynolds,
should this matter proceed to trial,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.479
you may be required to
repeat your evidence.

14:09.480 --> 14:10.839
No, I'm not testifying.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.199
- Ms Reynolds...
- I am not.

14:12.200 --> 14:13.999
If you don't follow the directions
of this commission

14:14.000 --> 14:15.399
you'll be found in contempt
and jailed.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.719
Whoop-de-fucking-do!

14:17.720 --> 14:19.400
At least I won't be dead.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.039
And that's what happens
when you cross Darren Faulkes.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.520
Now, you ask Clay.

14:25.840 --> 14:27.080
Ask Clay about that.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.200
Please.

14:40.160 --> 14:43.520
I'm begging you, just...
just let me go for my life.

14:46.440 --> 14:48.440
For my life, let me go.

14:50.160 --> 14:51.640
Please.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.479
We can't keep her
in the country anyway.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.999
And even if we could convince her
to give evidence,

15:01.000 --> 15:02.759
Darren paid for the scarf thing
in cash,

15:02.760 --> 15:05.479
so there's no paper trail
connecting him to Clay or Oliver.

15:05.480 --> 15:06.759
Her word against his.

15:06.760 --> 15:08.919
Jaz, in the past 48 hours,

15:08.920 --> 15:10.879
thousands of new online betting
accounts have been opened

15:10.880 --> 15:14.279
across several companies,
and not one has placed a single bet.

15:14.280 --> 15:16.045
They're waiting for something.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.360
Faulkes' next big sporting fix.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.290
He's going to do it again.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.399
Asleep?

15:34.400 --> 15:36.999
How many fingers and toes
have you got to cross?

15:37.000 --> 15:39.879
After Amal and the DPP,
are there any hours left in the day?

15:39.880 --> 15:42.719
Once you sacrifice sleep,
it becomes very manageable.

15:42.720 --> 15:45.199
Andy's going to cut back his hours,
and I want to sit the bar.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.559
That's great. Good for you.

15:46.560 --> 15:47.999
Convincing.

15:48.000 --> 15:50.759
You and Ben took the bar
no problem. Why shouldn't I?

15:50.760 --> 15:52.878
- Did you want a tea?
- No, I'm good.

15:54.640 --> 15:55.759
OK, spit it out.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.640
What? I haven't... I'm not...

16:00.240 --> 16:01.559
How do you do that?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.479
You've always been terrible
at hiding things, Richard.

16:03.480 --> 16:05.759
It's one of your charms.

16:05.760 --> 16:07.719
What have you done?
Slept with a client?

16:07.720 --> 16:09.719
No, a client's wife.

16:09.720 --> 16:11.839
I mean, she isn't even
really a client's wife.

16:11.840 --> 16:15.239
She is his wife,
but he'd sacked me before I...

16:15.240 --> 16:16.599
...before we...

16:16.600 --> 16:19.959
And I haven't again,
not since that night,

16:19.960 --> 16:21.879
and especially not
since the client rehired me.

16:21.880 --> 16:22.920
I was joking.

16:28.440 --> 16:30.039
- Who is it?
- It's not important who...

16:30.040 --> 16:32.079
Is it Lucy Baldwin?

16:32.080 --> 16:33.479
Am I that transparent?

16:33.480 --> 16:35.279
I saw the way you looked at her
at the charity auction.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.719
It's funny you mention
the charity auction.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.359
Ever since that night...

16:41.360 --> 16:42.519
You know Pearl Perati?

16:42.520 --> 16:43.999
Yeah, I'm prosecuting the guy

16:44.000 --> 16:46.679
charged with having
a sexual relationship with her.

16:46.680 --> 16:48.759
That incident where
the footballers groped her,

16:48.760 --> 16:52.349
that ended up online and led to her
brother's fight with Nate?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.279
I saw it happen.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.119
OK.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.839
I mean, I was right there, Lina.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.319
I was not five metres away
from a girl being sexually assaulted

17:03.320 --> 17:06.439
and I... I did nothing.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.599
Just stood there.

17:10.319 --> 17:13.679
I knew I should have said something
or done something,

17:13.680 --> 17:16.240
but I just did nothing.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.440
- Bystander effect.
- It's not a defence.

17:22.119 --> 17:23.885
I always had this idea that...

17:24.960 --> 17:27.199
...while I wasn't exactly Superman,

17:27.200 --> 17:32.039
I was at least a half-decent
human being, but I...

17:32.040 --> 17:34.759
You're not a bad person,
Richard.

17:34.760 --> 17:35.839
You're not.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.239
In fact, you're such a very good one
you're not used to it

17:38.240 --> 17:39.719
when you behave like the rest of us

17:39.720 --> 17:42.200
and make an error of judgement
or two.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.439
So, you need a date
for the Premier's drinks?

17:55.440 --> 17:57.759
You want to rub shoulders
with the politicians.

17:57.760 --> 17:59.559
Might make some useful friends.

17:59.560 --> 18:01.759
Friends or mutually beneficial
contacts?

18:01.760 --> 18:03.479
If you want to put it that way.

18:03.480 --> 18:06.319
In what way are you
beneficial to them?

18:06.320 --> 18:09.319
Well, one, young and attractive,
two, wildly intelligent,

18:09.320 --> 18:10.999
and three, I speak Mandarin.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.519
And we are in
the Pacific Century, so...

18:12.520 --> 18:14.479
- The whole package.
- Exactly.

18:14.480 --> 18:17.399
So, by accepting your invite,
I'm really doing you a favour.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.239
What about the director
of public prosecutions?

18:20.240 --> 18:21.999
Convicted any major crims lately?

18:22.000 --> 18:25.599
The case that's taking up most
of my time is radicalised youth,

18:25.600 --> 18:27.599
but incipient terrorism's
hardly a problem

18:27.600 --> 18:30.519
compared to the forces of evil
in lawn bowls and badminton.

18:30.520 --> 18:33.519
Hey, the NCC
does important work, too.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.479
And Queen Janet's still
the cleverest person in the room.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.759
You betcha.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.079
Though, she kind of is.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.479
She drives me nuts
and I will shoot myself in the head

18:43.480 --> 18:44.799
if I ever become that uptight,

18:44.800 --> 18:48.079
but she's bloody smart
and she has a great wardrobe,

18:48.080 --> 18:51.159
and, man, she is a dog
with a smelly old bone.

18:51.160 --> 18:53.919
Just digs and digs
till she's sniffed it out.

18:53.920 --> 18:55.509
Janet the obsessive canine.

18:56.440 --> 18:59.793
And is her bone shaped like
Darren Faulkes, by any chance?

19:00.520 --> 19:03.360
I can't tell you that,
you cheeky shit.

19:05.720 --> 19:07.480
Cheers.

19:11.920 --> 19:14.119
Lina seems to think
Pearl won't cope,

19:14.120 --> 19:17.439
but she's a lot tougher
than anyone realises.

19:17.440 --> 19:20.911
You'd have to have an iron will
to get through what she has.

19:21.360 --> 19:25.559
Anyway, it's good. At least now
she's got a safe place to stay, so...

19:25.560 --> 19:28.719
So, the apartment isn't really
a long-term option.

19:28.720 --> 19:31.159
Until she's 16, it's her only option.

19:31.160 --> 19:32.959
Well, it's not.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.999
She can't go back to her
alcoholic mother,

19:35.000 --> 19:37.399
and share houses for people
her age are just drug dens

19:37.400 --> 19:41.479
and she's not old enough to get
a lease for her own place, so...

19:41.480 --> 19:44.439
There are other options.
There's shelters, fostering.

19:44.440 --> 19:46.519
Shelters are for short-term crisis
accommodation.

19:46.520 --> 19:48.873
Fostering takes months to organise,
so...

19:50.080 --> 19:54.679
Hang on, didn't you agree that
the apartment was the only option?

19:54.680 --> 19:57.919
No, you'd already made up your
mind. Full-on prosecutor mode.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.079
OK, can you think of
something better?

20:00.080 --> 20:03.200
- No. It's just...
- Just what?

20:04.360 --> 20:07.066
I just wish you'd talked it over
with me first.

20:08.120 --> 20:10.679
OK. It is my money.

20:10.680 --> 20:12.519
It's not about the money.

20:12.520 --> 20:15.226
It's the sort of decision
I thought we'd share.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.119
Graham, hi.

20:25.120 --> 20:28.239
I had a meeting in town,
with a lawyer, as it happens,

20:28.240 --> 20:29.439
so I thought I'd pop around and see

20:29.440 --> 20:33.039
how your champion sprinters
are getting on.

20:33.040 --> 20:35.279
- We saw you on TV this morning.
- Did you, now?

20:35.280 --> 20:38.279
Your mother wasn't allowed to
watch TV during the weekdays.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.279
It was news, actually...

20:39.280 --> 20:40.919
What have you got there?
Is that basil?

20:40.920 --> 20:42.279
We're making pesto.

20:42.280 --> 20:45.759
Real, from leaves.
Not from a jar like Mum does.

20:45.760 --> 20:48.159
Do you want some?
He can stay, can't he, Mum?

20:48.160 --> 20:50.279
I'm sure he's very busy, so...

20:50.280 --> 20:54.840
A man's got to eat, and
since it's not from a jar, let's go.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.919
- Come on, Liam!
- I'm coming!

20:58.920 --> 21:01.319
Um, you'd remember Bianca?

21:01.320 --> 21:02.399
Yes, of course.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.479
I'm surprised you two aren't sick of
the sight of each other.

21:05.480 --> 21:08.775
- Hurry up, Graham!
- You can sit next to me.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.119
Wow. Cool!

21:16.120 --> 21:17.800
And if you take some out...

21:24.280 --> 21:25.879
- It's higher.
- It sounds higher.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.039
- The pitch is higher.
- Can you do it again, Graham?

21:28.040 --> 21:29.519
Yeah.

21:39.360 --> 21:41.999
Alright, that's enough symphonies,
OK? You've got school tomorrow.

21:42.000 --> 21:44.439
- Say your goodnights.
- Goodnight.

21:44.440 --> 21:45.920
Goodnight.

21:47.320 --> 21:48.559
Great pesto.

21:48.560 --> 21:50.796
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Graham.

21:51.760 --> 21:56.279
In amongst all this
being bankrupt hoo-ha,

21:56.280 --> 21:58.599
I've realised there's a few more
bits

21:58.600 --> 22:00.953
I should pass on to you people,
you know.

22:05.080 --> 22:07.679
- Concerns Darren Faulkes.
- What about him?

22:07.680 --> 22:09.719
You need to come into
the commission, then.

22:09.720 --> 22:12.191
Give your evidence
under proper conditions.

22:13.720 --> 22:16.040
Good, yeah. Set it up, would you?

22:17.360 --> 22:19.920
I'd better be on my way too.

22:20.960 --> 22:22.839
- You're not driving.
- No, I'm fine.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.359
No, it's alright.
I'll call you a taxi.

22:24.360 --> 22:26.679
- I'm fine.
- Don't be stupid.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.799
Stop fussing, would you?

22:28.800 --> 22:30.095
Well, stay here, then.

22:31.280 --> 22:32.760
What, with you?

22:35.800 --> 22:39.480
Yeah, yeah, if it stops you
killing yourself or someone else.

22:40.960 --> 22:44.599
Well, I do have another
early meeting with my lawyer,

22:44.600 --> 22:47.120
so, I accept.

22:48.280 --> 22:49.520
Great.

22:53.040 --> 22:54.839
I'll see you in the morning.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.320
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

23:00.120 --> 23:02.119
Come on, it's not as if we're
going to sit around

23:02.120 --> 23:03.719
talking about the reference
all night.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.239
Janet, you shouldn't be
talking to him at all.

23:05.240 --> 23:06.759
What, so I just let him drive?

23:06.760 --> 23:08.879
Well, if he's going to give more
evidence, I can't be here.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.959
Tony will have conniptions
I even stayed for dinner.

23:10.960 --> 23:13.039
You need to understand.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.920
This... this is very unusual.

23:15.960 --> 23:19.431
You don't know what it's been like
between my father and me.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.935
You're right, I don't know,
and I did need to understand.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.426
It's another thing it might have
been nice to have talked about.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.659
This Security Commission inquiry...

24:11.600 --> 24:13.600
...must be very stressful for you.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.335
Would be if I thought
I couldn't win it.

24:39.520 --> 24:42.519
And how often did the defendant
have sexual intercourse with you?

24:42.520 --> 24:43.999
Every night.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.959
During the day, too,
if he was there.

24:45.960 --> 24:47.239
Did you ever refuse?

24:47.240 --> 24:51.199
I tried, but if I didn't sleep with
him, he would have chucked me out.

24:51.200 --> 24:54.083
- How do you know that?
- 'Cause he said so.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.600
Thank you, Pearl.

24:58.880 --> 25:01.239
Miss Perati,

25:01.240 --> 25:03.559
how did you come to know
Flynn Pearce?

25:03.560 --> 25:05.040
Through my brother.

25:06.640 --> 25:08.879
And how did you come to
stay in his home?

25:08.880 --> 25:12.645
After Tyler died, things at home were
no good, so I messaged him.

25:13.960 --> 25:15.879
Would you mind giving us
some more details?

25:15.880 --> 25:19.519
Was this message sent
via social media, or email?

25:19.520 --> 25:21.199
It was Hook Up.

25:21.200 --> 25:24.359
Hook Up? That's a dating app?

25:24.360 --> 25:27.799
- A phone dating app?
- Yeah, I guess.

25:27.800 --> 25:29.999
And you had
your own Hook Up account?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
- Yes.
- Which you set up yourself.

25:32.840 --> 25:33.839
Yeah.

25:33.840 --> 25:35.429
Ms Perati, how old are you?

25:41.480 --> 25:43.359
- 15.
- 15.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.760
Which is why we are all here.

25:46.960 --> 25:50.490
Your Honour, could the witness
please be shown this document?

26:02.280 --> 26:05.810
Ms Perati, is this the sign-up page
for your Hook Up account?

26:08.200 --> 26:12.440
Did you check the box that affirms
that you are 18 or older?

26:16.640 --> 26:18.640
Ms Perati, did you check that box?

26:20.160 --> 26:21.159
Yep.

26:21.160 --> 26:23.399
You represented yourself as being
above the age of consent,

26:23.400 --> 26:24.440
didn't you?

26:30.640 --> 26:32.200
No further questions.

26:39.400 --> 26:41.799
You said Hook Up
wasn't your first contact

26:41.800 --> 26:43.280
with Flynn Pearce.

26:44.280 --> 26:48.200
Um... I'd met him a couple of times
with my brother.

26:49.680 --> 26:52.599
What were the circumstances
of these meetings with Mr Pearce

26:52.600 --> 26:53.599
pre-Hook Up?

26:53.600 --> 26:57.999
Once I was waiting for Ty outside the
footy club and Flynn was there too,

26:58.000 --> 27:02.359
and he came to see Ty at home
a couple of times as well.

27:02.360 --> 27:06.159
What were the circumstances of
other meetings with Mr Pearce?

27:06.160 --> 27:08.679
I was at soccer training
and Ty picked me up,

27:08.680 --> 27:10.559
and we were in a cafe
and Flynn came in.

27:10.560 --> 27:11.999
Do you remember
what you were wearing?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.839
Um... my training gear
and my rep jacket.

27:14.840 --> 27:16.759
And what age division were you?

27:16.760 --> 27:19.079
Under-16s. It said so on the jacket.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.879
Do you remember how your brother
first introduced you to Mr Pearce?

27:22.880 --> 27:25.520
He said, "This is Pearl,
my little sister."

27:26.880 --> 27:28.440
His "little sister".

27:31.320 --> 27:32.640
Yeah.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.600
Thank you, Pearl.

27:38.160 --> 27:42.239
But if they do acquit, then there
goes the leverage on the Oxycodone.

27:42.240 --> 27:44.679
About that,
I've been doing some digging.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.719
Flynn Pearce studied medicine.

27:46.720 --> 27:47.839
Dropped out in his third year,

27:47.840 --> 27:49.879
but not before doing a stint
as a student

27:49.880 --> 27:51.679
at the Greater Southern
District Hospital.

27:51.680 --> 27:53.999
The hospital where the Oxycodone
was stolen from?

27:54.000 --> 27:55.079
I'd call that leverage.

27:55.080 --> 27:56.919
I'd call it circumstantial,
but useful.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.399
The mystery phone's turned on,

27:58.400 --> 28:00.479
the one used at Clay's place
the night before he died.

28:00.480 --> 28:03.399
Been dead as corduroy flares
for weeks, but just now, bing!

28:03.400 --> 28:05.239
- Where is it?
- You'll never guess.

28:05.240 --> 28:06.639
That's why I asked.

28:06.640 --> 28:07.999
Cartwright Pharmacy.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.359
Same place Eddie Cooke visited

28:09.360 --> 28:11.679
when he was hunting drugs
for Zoe DiCosta.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.119
Coincidence? I think not.

28:13.120 --> 28:15.532
Let me know if it moves. Wayne?

28:26.960 --> 28:28.599
There's nine people inside -

28:28.600 --> 28:31.279
pharmacist, three staff,
five customers.

28:31.280 --> 28:34.039
Given it wasn't a woman
or an old bloke who threatened Clay,

28:34.040 --> 28:36.158
I'd say those are our three
likelies.

28:39.120 --> 28:41.319
What do you reckon?
Watch and wait?

28:41.320 --> 28:44.399
Let's flush him out with a wrong
number. Get ready in case he bolts.

28:44.400 --> 28:45.760
Right.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.680
Hello?

29:28.560 --> 29:31.279
- Is that your phone?
- No.

29:31.280 --> 29:32.760
You answered it.

29:33.960 --> 29:36.559
A man gave it to me.

29:36.560 --> 29:38.439
Eddie Cooke?

29:38.440 --> 29:40.959
You know about him too? Dear God.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.879
Did Eddie Cooke give you
this phone?

29:42.880 --> 29:45.439
No.
What's your connection to Cooke?

29:45.440 --> 29:49.239
We have an arrangement.
I import steroids from China.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.719
As a compounding chemist,

29:51.720 --> 29:54.479
customs checks on my packages
aren't as rigorous.

29:54.480 --> 29:56.759
What about the phone?

29:56.760 --> 29:57.839
Dear God.

29:57.840 --> 30:00.519
A few weeks ago,

30:00.520 --> 30:02.559
a man who I'd never seen before
came in

30:02.560 --> 30:04.639
and said I was to change the order

30:04.640 --> 30:07.599
to include some other substances
as well.

30:07.600 --> 30:09.759
Safrole, formamide, PMK.

30:09.760 --> 30:11.079
Precursors to MDMA.

30:11.080 --> 30:12.679
He gave me the phone,

30:12.680 --> 30:17.760
he said when the chemicals arrive,
turn it on and call a preset number.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.480
Are the precursors here?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.012
Behind the toilet rolls.

30:24.960 --> 30:27.839
- Have you made the call?
- No, not yet.

30:27.840 --> 30:30.879
I was getting ready to
and you guys arrived.

30:30.880 --> 30:35.399
That man, you see...
he gave me a choice.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.079
He said if I was to make any trouble,

30:39.080 --> 30:40.759
I would have to choose between

30:40.760 --> 30:43.639
killing myself,

30:43.640 --> 30:48.000
or him... killing my granddaughter.

30:54.040 --> 30:55.679
So, the only real question

30:55.680 --> 30:57.680
you've gotta ask yourself is this.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.679
Who do you love more,

31:01.680 --> 31:05.160
yourself or your son?

31:08.840 --> 31:12.017
Was that the man who
told you to import the precursors?

31:14.440 --> 31:15.439
Yeah.

31:15.440 --> 31:19.479
But you can't describe him
or recall his eye colour, age, hair?

31:19.480 --> 31:21.639
The stress.

31:21.640 --> 31:23.759
I'm... I'm not very good with faces.

31:27.440 --> 31:31.039
OK, the number he was given to call
is registered to a false name.

31:31.040 --> 31:34.439
In fact, all the numbers this phone
has ever called or received

31:34.440 --> 31:38.279
are registered to false IDs,
including Maxine's Dorothy Gale.

31:38.280 --> 31:41.119
The only legit one was your father,
the night Clay got monstered.

31:41.120 --> 31:45.559
So, whoever's phone this is
is the invisible man.

31:45.560 --> 31:47.799
A voice but no face.

31:47.800 --> 31:50.160
Have we got a trace on this?
Yep.

31:51.600 --> 31:53.080
Make the call please.

31:54.520 --> 31:56.000
Please.

31:57.760 --> 31:59.240
OK.

32:05.400 --> 32:06.880
It's ringing.

32:09.520 --> 32:12.359
Cartwright Pharmacy.

32:12.360 --> 32:17.560
Yeah, um...
your product has arrived.

32:20.360 --> 32:23.040
OK, when?

32:27.240 --> 32:31.519
That wasn't him. The... the man,
his voice is colder.

32:31.520 --> 32:34.119
Senior Constable Page will take you
back now, Mr Cartwright.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.119
We've got a watch on your family,
so don't worry about that,

32:36.120 --> 32:39.079
and whoever comes to collect the
precursors, just behave normally.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.999
- We'll do the rest.
- Let's go.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.040
Thank you.

32:47.640 --> 32:49.639
Darren Faulkes hasn't got
convictions

32:49.640 --> 32:51.879
for amphetamine production,
does he?

32:51.880 --> 32:54.399
He's too clever to have
convictions for anything.

32:54.400 --> 32:56.599
If he is making money from MDMA,
it's arm's length.

32:56.600 --> 32:58.079
And even though he knows
we're watching him,

32:58.080 --> 32:59.519
he thinks he's cleverer than we are.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.319
Thinks we haven't twigged to
this particular string to his bow.

33:02.320 --> 33:06.438
Plus he must need the cash since the
spot bet on the wide fell through.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.319
We've got tracking devices
on the precursors.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.279
- Have to see where they take us.
- I've just got to call Lina.

33:10.280 --> 33:13.639
See if the jury's back. Has my
father's hearing been scheduled?

33:13.640 --> 33:16.279
- Later today. Tony's running it.
- OK.

33:16.280 --> 33:18.120
Are they back?

33:19.400 --> 33:21.559
Well, if they'd accepted the Hook Up
defence without question

33:21.560 --> 33:23.399
they'd have acquitted by now.

33:23.400 --> 33:25.760
Janet! Janet! I need you to come.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.419
- Hang up the phone.
- I have to go.

33:30.560 --> 33:32.200
So, guess what bunny has...

33:33.520 --> 33:36.999
So, guess what bunny has to listen
to all the listening device files

33:37.000 --> 33:38.679
before archiving
or destroying them?

33:38.680 --> 33:40.280
Tell me.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.360
Put those on.

33:46.440 --> 33:49.079
Lucy Baldwin's house,
four nights ago.

33:52.200 --> 33:54.199
God, don't stop.

33:54.200 --> 33:56.879
- Are you sure?
- I don't know, just don't stop.

33:56.880 --> 33:59.199
You're so beautiful.

33:59.200 --> 34:00.599
Lucy.

34:04.120 --> 34:07.839
It's him, isn't it?
Richard Stirling, with Lucy Baldwin?

34:07.840 --> 34:09.320
Richard.

34:10.880 --> 34:12.319
Archives or bin?

34:12.320 --> 34:15.559
It's personal. Has no bearing
on our investigation, so...

34:15.560 --> 34:18.208
That's what I thought too,
but it's your call.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.560
Archives or bin?

34:22.960 --> 34:24.080
Archives.

34:29.639 --> 34:34.478
You told us your relationship
with Mr Faulkes extended only as far

34:34.480 --> 34:37.879
as you facilitating
ex gratia salary cap payments

34:37.880 --> 34:40.079
from him to Nate Baldwin.

34:40.080 --> 34:42.839
I'd like to add to that, as long
as what I say remains confidential.

34:42.840 --> 34:45.759
The NCC's not in the habit
of blabbing about our sources.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.599
If, however, the matters proceed
to trial, you may be called.

34:48.600 --> 34:51.199
Right, last season
Faulkes approached me

34:51.199 --> 34:54.879
asking me if I'd be interested in
being involved in match fixing.

34:54.880 --> 34:57.239
Which matches?
What sport?

34:57.240 --> 34:59.439
Cricket, footy, soccer,

34:59.440 --> 35:03.679
any sport connected to
the Pax Sport Foundation.

35:03.680 --> 35:05.839
And what did Mr Faulkes
ask you to do?

35:05.840 --> 35:07.639
Keep an eye out for
any young players who may be

35:07.640 --> 35:10.559
interested in supplementing their...
their match fees.

35:10.560 --> 35:12.159
He wanted you to act as a spotter

35:12.160 --> 35:14.690
for up-and-coming athletes
he could corrupt.

35:15.200 --> 35:17.159
You could put it like that.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.759
And did you do as he requested?

35:18.760 --> 35:21.439
No.

35:21.440 --> 35:24.839
We've heard Mr Faulkes
is difficult to refuse.

35:24.840 --> 35:27.399
I laughed at him
and he never asked me again.

35:27.400 --> 35:28.399
Mr King...

35:28.400 --> 35:30.039
He asked me on
the 23rd of March last year.

35:30.040 --> 35:32.399
We were both on the balcony
of the Australian Club.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.839
It was a Devils function.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.599
You can check my diary.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.759
We've got no hard evidence,
no paper trail,

36:01.760 --> 36:03.839
no idea how Darren
launders the millions

36:03.840 --> 36:05.159
he makes from the betting scams.

36:05.160 --> 36:06.879
Bonnie's fine-tooth-combed
his finances.

36:06.880 --> 36:10.057
- No sign of any hidden cash.
- It has to be somewhere.

36:11.920 --> 36:14.519
Your father's evidence
was useful.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.080
I'll leave you to it.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.319
Do you have plans for the evening?

36:21.320 --> 36:23.840
Leftovers. Supervising homework.

36:28.000 --> 36:31.280
You're welcome
if you can stand pesto again.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.199
How was your meeting
with your lawyer?

36:38.200 --> 36:41.879
Expensive. Bloody lawyers
and your five-minute increments.

36:41.880 --> 36:44.079
We're not all driven by money.

36:44.080 --> 36:47.200
No. You seem to enjoy
fighting the good fight.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.599
Apparently you have
an altruistic streak, too.

36:50.600 --> 36:54.640
I assumed you were around
somewhere, listening at the keyhole.

36:57.280 --> 36:58.439
That bloke Gillies, your boss,

36:58.440 --> 37:00.879
do you think he'd put a good word
in for me?

37:00.880 --> 37:02.679
A good word? With who?

37:02.680 --> 37:05.439
Well, a letter from the NCC
attesting to my good character,

37:05.440 --> 37:06.599
my sense of civic duty,

37:06.600 --> 37:09.520
might keep the Security
Commission's dogs at bay.

37:10.880 --> 37:14.199
So, that's why you came in today,
to get off those charges.

37:14.200 --> 37:15.799
Two birds, one stone.

37:15.800 --> 37:17.759
Always got an agenda, haven't you?

37:17.760 --> 37:19.759
You've always got
something planned.

37:19.760 --> 37:21.639
I always make
the most of my options.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.399
- Right.
- I mean, I expect you do too.

37:23.400 --> 37:25.279
Here I was, thinking you were
actually going to do

37:25.280 --> 37:26.559
something for someone else
for once.

37:26.560 --> 37:29.031
Don't be so childish, Janet.
It's business.

37:33.440 --> 37:35.160
Shh! Shh, shh, shh, shh!

37:39.000 --> 37:40.480
Keep watching.

37:43.400 --> 37:45.280
Remember his pain.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.880
Remember your fear.

37:49.320 --> 37:51.239
No more questions.

37:57.080 --> 37:58.799
You and your daddy,

37:58.800 --> 38:02.280
you're gonna be very, very quiet
from now on.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.400
You're gonna be
as silent as the grave.

38:18.840 --> 38:20.320
Good girl.

38:22.560 --> 38:24.320
Graham. Graham.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.200
Dad!

38:31.880 --> 38:33.879
OK, thanks. Let me know.

38:33.880 --> 38:35.599
God, Janet, are you alright?

38:35.600 --> 38:36.999
Yeah, I'm fine.

38:37.000 --> 38:39.199
Your father?

38:39.200 --> 38:42.839
Fractured ribs,
bruised spleen, concussion.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.599
He was lucky that was all.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.439
What did he try to do,
defend his wallet?

38:46.440 --> 38:49.000
No, it wasn't a mugging,
it was a message.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.520
From Darren Faulkes.

38:53.960 --> 38:56.999
It was the man who threatened Clay
and the pharmacist.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.480
I didn't see his face.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.640
That voice.

39:04.640 --> 39:08.079
He told me, you know,
not to ask any more questions,

39:08.080 --> 39:10.680
and his mates, they just...

39:12.040 --> 39:13.760
...kicked Dad to pieces.

39:23.480 --> 39:25.119
A few moments earlier
I was so angry with him

39:25.120 --> 39:26.768
I wanted to kick him myself.

39:32.720 --> 39:33.839
He only gave evidence

39:33.840 --> 39:36.599
to curry favour with
the Securities Commission.

39:36.600 --> 39:38.479
It doesn't make his evidence false.

39:38.480 --> 39:40.520
No, just his motives.

39:44.600 --> 39:46.120
He's such an old bastard.

40:00.720 --> 40:01.720
Hey, Dad.

41:12.640 --> 41:14.640
Could the foreperson please stand?

41:19.360 --> 41:22.239
On the charge of having
sexual intercourse

41:22.240 --> 41:24.159
with a child between 10 and 16,

41:24.160 --> 41:27.219
how do you find the defendant -
guilty or not guilty?

41:30.400 --> 41:32.200
Not guilty.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.076
I'm sorry.

42:00.560 --> 42:03.079
No, it had to be that Hook Up thing.

42:03.080 --> 42:04.599
There's no other grounds
for acquittal.

42:04.600 --> 42:06.559
Don't forget,
we've still got Flynn's connection

42:06.560 --> 42:08.359
to the Oxycodone
we found at Clay's house.

42:08.360 --> 42:09.679
We can use that
to shake him up a bit.

42:09.680 --> 42:12.559
Yeah, but a guilty verdict would
have made our life so much easier.

42:12.560 --> 42:13.999
What do you mean,
made your life easier?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.039
Bianca, I've got to go.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.239
You put me through all this shit
for something to do with your work?

42:17.240 --> 42:20.239
The NCC does have an interest
in Flynn over another matter.

42:20.240 --> 42:22.399
Look, but first and foremost,
I wanted to see him convicted

42:22.400 --> 42:24.518
because what he did to you
was wrong.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.000
He got off.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.959
Nate Baldwin.

42:35.960 --> 42:38.519
He killed Ty
and they just let him out of jail.

42:38.520 --> 42:40.559
I did explain the drug that was
given to Ty led to his...

42:40.560 --> 42:41.799
You knew this was gonna happen?

42:41.800 --> 42:43.199
- Look, Nate's punch...
- I don't...

42:43.200 --> 42:45.239
I don't wanna hear it, Janet.

42:45.240 --> 42:46.480
Any of it.

42:48.120 --> 42:50.319
Nate got off, Flynn got off
and now they can go have a laugh

42:50.320 --> 42:53.199
about how they both fucked
the Peratis.

42:53.200 --> 42:54.680
Fuck.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.279
I owe you, mate.
I owe you big-time.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.159
What are you going to do now?

43:00.160 --> 43:01.639
Not play footy, that's for sure.

43:01.640 --> 43:05.359
Yanni and the Devils are in the
crap, Mitchell's gone to smoke.

43:05.360 --> 43:07.559
I haven't heard from Maxine in days.

43:07.560 --> 43:10.119
I need a new trade, an honest one.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.356
Maybe I'll become a...
become a lawyer.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.772
You're the only ones
who have stuck by me.

43:20.520 --> 43:21.640
You and Luce.

43:27.160 --> 43:29.160
Um, we should go.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.919
Thanks again, mate.
Stay out of trouble.

43:33.920 --> 43:35.560
Yeah.

43:41.040 --> 43:43.719
♪ If you're happy and
you know it, jump for joy

43:43.720 --> 43:44.799

Scrap is jumping for joy, too.

44:06.040 --> 44:08.599
Woof! Woof!
And he's wagging his tail.

44:08.600 --> 44:10.679
Love you, sweetie.

44:10.680 --> 44:14.959
He's been practising tricks
in front of the mirror.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.559
Bad day for the prosecution?

44:16.560 --> 44:18.149
Better one for the defence.

44:19.040 --> 44:22.639
It's a function of my
pathological insecurity -

44:22.640 --> 44:25.079
women won't like me
unless I rescue them,

44:25.080 --> 44:27.799
be useful, somehow.

44:27.800 --> 44:31.319
Well, rescuing's not necessarily
a bad urge,

44:31.320 --> 44:33.850
especially if there are
dragons in the area.

44:35.080 --> 44:37.719
You know who really did
need my help?

44:37.720 --> 44:40.200
Pearl Perati, and I failed her.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.479
So did I.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.559
Do you want to watch
some Play School?

44:50.560 --> 44:52.040
Yeah.

44:59.640 --> 45:01.240
Your father's recovering?

45:04.040 --> 45:05.520
He's got a hard head.

45:08.840 --> 45:10.560
Maybe it runs in the family.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.798
Someone's picking up
the precursors from the pharmacy.

45:21.120 --> 45:22.519
- Are we connected?
- Yeah.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.439
Wayne, we're listening.

45:24.440 --> 45:27.382
Definitely old Hazelnut Hinksman
doing the honours.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.320
He's on the move.

46:15.200 --> 46:17.319
Hinksman's gone into
Antonioni &amp; Sons,

46:17.320 --> 46:19.199
213 River Street, Mascot.

46:25.280 --> 46:27.439
Suspected links to
the Calabrian Mafia,

46:27.440 --> 46:29.279
and 'Ndrangheta, out of Griffith.

46:29.280 --> 46:30.760
Sale time.

46:34.320 --> 46:37.959
Who should I follow?
Hazelnut or the Antonionis?

46:37.960 --> 46:41.902
Hinksman will be collecting, what,
about 500,000 for the precursors?

46:42.440 --> 46:44.599
As Tony says, we follow the money.

46:44.600 --> 46:45.799
Stay on Hinksman, Wayne.

46:45.800 --> 46:48.506
I'll get a second team
to watch the Antonionis.

47:03.000 --> 47:05.399
Shannon Hinksman's
back at the St Peter's warehouse

47:05.400 --> 47:07.680
full of cash and burner phones.

47:09.600 --> 47:12.279
There's another car parked
out front. It could be...

47:12.280 --> 47:13.999
Holy dooley!

47:14.000 --> 47:15.639
What?

47:15.640 --> 47:16.879
It's the arsonist.

47:16.880 --> 47:20.920
The bloke we reckon torched
Wazim Jandaphur's place.

47:24.960 --> 47:26.160
He's carrying.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.280
It's a semiautomatic,
by the look of it.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.919
When they come out,
what's the call?

47:36.920 --> 47:39.079
Hazelnut or the arsonist?

47:39.080 --> 47:40.879
Well, everything we know
about Hinksman so far

47:40.880 --> 47:42.159
says he's just muscle.

47:42.160 --> 47:43.399
The other guy's a blank slate.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.559
A blank slate who burns down houses.
Shouldn't we bring him in?

47:45.560 --> 47:47.799
Only if we do it without alerting
Faulkes we're onto him.

47:47.800 --> 47:49.999
He's carrying a concealed weapon.
Wayne can just arrest him.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.199
We don't want to reveal
that we've been watching him.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.679
Or that we know about
the warehouse.

47:53.680 --> 47:55.799
I'll traffic stop him
for a broken tail-light

47:55.800 --> 47:57.239
then arrest him for the gun.

47:57.240 --> 48:00.040
- Does he have a broken tail-light?
- Not yet.

48:15.280 --> 48:16.560
Now he does.

48:18.760 --> 48:21.119
Shit.

48:21.120 --> 48:22.600
Wayne, what's going on?

48:24.520 --> 48:26.439
Ooh!

48:26.440 --> 48:28.879
It's my knee. I've buggered my knee.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.839
What about the target?
Can you stay with him?

48:30.840 --> 48:33.799
No, no, I don't think I can.
He's driving.

48:33.800 --> 48:38.080
It's a blue station wagon -
Charlie, Golf, 4, 8, Sierra, Bravo.

48:42.000 --> 48:43.799
If we don't get a tail on him now,
we've lost him.

48:43.800 --> 48:46.639
Shit. OK, um, has he seen you?

48:46.640 --> 48:48.599
No, I'm behind his car.

48:48.600 --> 48:50.759
OK, Wayne...

48:50.760 --> 48:53.039
Wayne, do you have
your phone on you?

48:53.040 --> 48:55.276
- Yeah.
- OK, put it in the tail-light.

49:00.640 --> 49:02.720
Jeez!

49:03.760 --> 49:05.479
Is it in?

49:05.480 --> 49:08.280
It's in. You can track him.

49:09.880 --> 49:12.292
He's on the move.
Who's available?

49:41.400 --> 49:43.224
Your left tail-light is broken.

49:45.120 --> 49:46.240
It is?

49:47.600 --> 49:49.659
Get out of the car and have a look.

49:50.760 --> 49:51.937
I believe you, mate.

49:54.440 --> 49:56.760
Get out of the car, have a look.

50:11.120 --> 50:13.439
Well, fancy that.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.264
You wanna show us your licence?

50:22.160 --> 50:23.799
Gun! Get down! Get down!

50:23.800 --> 50:25.439
- Hands on your head! Police!
- Hands on your head!

50:25.440 --> 50:27.199
- Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

50:27.200 --> 50:30.553
Hands on your head!
Get on your knees. Do it now.

50:31.480 --> 50:32.920
It's on his right hip.

50:41.480 --> 50:42.833
Hands behind your back.

50:54.480 --> 50:58.679
You're a bit of a dark horse,
aren't you, Mr Wesley John Foster?

50:58.680 --> 51:00.240
On your feet.

51:03.120 --> 51:06.768
Who ordered you to set fire
to Wazim Jandaphur's house?

51:10.240 --> 51:12.559
- That's not me.
- It's clearly you.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.960
No jury would believe otherwise.

51:16.720 --> 51:19.779
Actually, you know what?
You're right. Yeah, it's me.

51:21.960 --> 51:23.959
And what did you do after that?

51:23.960 --> 51:27.399
Went to a mate's barbecue.
Well, he needed gas.

51:27.400 --> 51:31.519
I certainly didn't
burn down any houses.

51:31.520 --> 51:34.719
This isn't helping you,
Mr Foster.

51:34.720 --> 51:37.439
The only way you'll help yourself
is to cooperate,

51:37.440 --> 51:41.080
otherwise I will keep you
locked up, indefinitely.

51:46.880 --> 51:49.645
Who ordered you to threaten
Clay Nelson's child?

51:50.360 --> 51:52.760
Induce Mr Nelson to suicide?

52:03.280 --> 52:05.399
But, Clay, you've been under

52:05.400 --> 52:07.719
a lot of pressure lately.

52:07.720 --> 52:09.399
I mean, all that guilt over Oliver,

52:09.400 --> 52:12.800
it must be really eating you up,
mate.

52:13.840 --> 52:18.360
I'm sure everyone would understand
if it all got too much.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.039
You've gotta be
fuckin' kidding me.

52:21.040 --> 52:23.399
It could look like an accident.

52:23.400 --> 52:25.279
You didn't mean to take too many.

52:25.280 --> 52:28.398
You just wanted everything to stop
for a little while.

52:29.440 --> 52:30.920
I'm not doin' that.

52:32.960 --> 52:35.359
Actually, fuck it.
I'll tell 'em everything, you know.

52:35.360 --> 52:37.399
I'll bring...
I'll bring you all down with me.

52:37.400 --> 52:38.880
Careful, Clay.

52:39.960 --> 52:43.240
If you do that, mate,
we're gonna kill your son.

52:44.600 --> 52:46.839
His school looks really nice, Clay.

52:46.840 --> 52:48.319
How dare you threaten me?

52:48.320 --> 52:50.399
That's your choice, Clay.

52:50.400 --> 52:51.839
And it's all you got.

52:51.840 --> 52:54.252
Like hell it is!
You come in here...

52:55.120 --> 52:58.079
Get the fuck out of here,
you fuckin' gorilla!

52:58.080 --> 53:01.320
You're gonna be
very, very quiet from now on.

53:02.600 --> 53:05.360
You're gonna be
as silent as the grave.

53:07.760 --> 53:10.439
We need absolute certainty.

53:10.440 --> 53:14.559
So the only real question
you've gotta ask yourself is this -

53:14.560 --> 53:16.200
who do you love more?

53:17.760 --> 53:19.240
Yourself...

53:21.600 --> 53:23.120
...or your son?

53:30.480 --> 53:32.600
You think that's me?
Really?

53:34.200 --> 53:35.359
Well, it's obvious to us.

53:35.360 --> 53:37.519
I don't know about obvious.

53:37.520 --> 53:40.039
Similar, maybe, yeah,
but nah, nah, it's not me.

53:40.040 --> 53:43.719
Mr Foster, do you really think
such a blatant lie

53:43.720 --> 53:46.119
would hold up in a court of law?

53:46.120 --> 53:47.599
Well, it all depends on how good

53:47.600 --> 53:49.919
the voice recognition technology is,
yeah?

53:49.920 --> 53:52.680
Last time I checked, not much chop.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.959
His prints are on the Oxycodone,

54:02.960 --> 54:05.759
but charging him with threat to kill
means further showing our hand.

54:05.760 --> 54:07.279
Well, we certainly don't want
Darren Faulkes

54:07.280 --> 54:09.759
to know the real reason his chief
enforcer's off the street.

54:09.760 --> 54:12.079
State Police will need to follow up
the concealed weapons charges.

54:12.080 --> 54:13.279
I'll take it to the DPP.

54:13.280 --> 54:16.239
Wayne called.
Hospital's confirmed a ruptured ACL.

54:16.240 --> 54:18.839
He'll be out of commission
for weeks, no pun intended.

54:18.840 --> 54:20.519
He's gutted
he won't be here for the kill.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.839
Doesn't matter how long
we keep Wes Foster locked up for,

54:22.840 --> 54:24.479
he's not going to tell us
anything about Darren,

54:24.480 --> 54:27.879
who meanwhile is getting ready
to ruin another young life.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.959
We always knew bringing Wes in
was a calculated risk.

54:29.960 --> 54:32.159
Well, at least he's in remand
with no chance of bail.

54:32.160 --> 54:35.319
Could we get an undercover cop in,
infiltrate Faulkes' world?

54:35.320 --> 54:37.639
Proper undercover takes
months, years, even.

54:37.640 --> 54:38.999
Turn someone on the inside?

54:39.000 --> 54:40.159
Someone who already
works for him?

54:40.160 --> 54:42.199
Time line for that's massive, too.

54:42.200 --> 54:43.399
Identifying possible targets,

54:43.400 --> 54:45.319
researching their weaknesses,
turning them.

54:45.320 --> 54:46.759
If we want to break open
Darren fast,

54:46.760 --> 54:50.159
we need someone he already trusts,
someone outside his inner sanctum

54:50.160 --> 54:51.639
who can ingratiate themselves

54:51.640 --> 54:53.559
because he believes
they're compromised.

54:53.560 --> 54:55.319
Well, if anyone can name
this particular individual

54:55.320 --> 54:57.556
who'd be so useful to us,
I'm all ears.

54:58.800 --> 55:00.680
I know someone.

55:04.800 --> 55:06.559
God, don't stop.

55:06.560 --> 55:09.399
- Are you sure?
- I don't know, just don't stop.

55:09.400 --> 55:11.879
You're so beautiful.

55:11.880 --> 55:13.200
You're so beautiful.

55:17.720 --> 55:19.199
Full disclosure -

55:19.200 --> 55:22.359
Darren Faulkes has made millions
through corruption in sport.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.039
He's also responsible for arson,

55:24.040 --> 55:28.199
assault, drug importation
and at least three deaths,

55:28.200 --> 55:30.080
that we know of.

55:31.840 --> 55:36.359
Does this make your request
one that I can't refuse?

55:36.360 --> 55:38.199
Of course you can refuse.

55:38.200 --> 55:41.024
This is just in the interests
of full disclosure.

55:42.800 --> 55:45.639
We're merely asking you to
consider your reputation

55:45.640 --> 55:48.039
and your commitment to justice.

55:48.040 --> 55:51.519
Only someone Darren trusts
can bring him down.

55:51.520 --> 55:55.403
And we'll take every measure to
prevent him from linking you to us.

56:01.560 --> 56:03.919
Nice shot.

56:03.920 --> 56:05.320
Room for a fourth?

56:10.080 --> 56:11.960
What's your handicap?

56:13.080 --> 56:14.800
Off 10.

56:19.480 --> 56:21.560
- Welcome to the club.
- Thank you.

56:37.000 --> 56:38.079
So, how can I help?

56:38.080 --> 56:39.599
Well, I was hoping
we could help each other,

56:39.600 --> 56:41.279
and I don't want
something for nothing.

56:41.280 --> 56:43.399
Nate, come on.
You know what you did, dickhead.

56:43.400 --> 56:44.959
You've gotta remember,
the circumstances...

56:44.960 --> 56:46.279
Nate!

56:46.280 --> 56:47.959
How can you feel you don't owe me

56:47.960 --> 56:50.399
some kind of explanation
or apology?

56:50.400 --> 56:51.959
I'm being straight with you, Darren.

56:51.960 --> 56:55.490
You fuckin' better be. You only get
one chance with me, mate.

56:56.600 --> 56:57.879
Don't underestimate her.

56:57.880 --> 56:59.559
Never. Not Janet.

56:59.560 --> 57:01.999
- We have to consider aborting.
- Now?

57:02.000 --> 57:04.639
Well, an order to kill
does change things.

57:04.640 --> 57:06.199
He still might be useful
tomorrow,

57:06.200 --> 57:08.730
but after that,
we don't him walking around.
