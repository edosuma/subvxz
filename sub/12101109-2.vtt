00:09.940 --> 00:11.839
Operation Lighthouse

00:11.873 --> 00:14.152
re the unsolved murder
of Gail Vella

00:14.186 --> 00:17.017
on September 10th, 2019.

00:18.363 --> 00:22.574
The name we've been given
is Ross Turner.

00:22.608 --> 00:24.300
Enter the property.

00:26.923 --> 00:29.443
<i>Five Three,
DP for custody transfer,</i>

00:29.477 --> 00:31.341
<i>bringing suspect out now.</i>

00:32.791 --> 00:34.413
Interview of Terry Boyle

00:34.448 --> 00:36.691
by Detective Chief
Inspector Davidson.

00:36.726 --> 00:39.246
Mr Boyle,
did you shoot Gail Vella?

00:44.734 --> 00:46.356
-Did anyone see that?
Armed police!

00:46.391 --> 00:47.633
Drop your weapons!
Drop your weapons!

00:51.844 --> 00:53.846
A significant number
of other fingerprints

00:53.881 --> 00:55.848
match an individual identified

00:55.883 --> 00:57.885
by the Police
National Computer

00:57.919 --> 00:59.197
as Carl Banks.

00:59.231 --> 01:01.302
Carl Banks has an
extensive history of violence,

01:01.337 --> 01:02.579
including firearms offences.

01:05.513 --> 01:07.343
<i>The person
who made me see that</i>

01:07.377 --> 01:09.828
<i>there was another way, to be
a useful member of society,</i>

01:09.862 --> 01:12.693
<i>was a police officer.
He's the reason why</i>

01:12.727 --> 01:15.385
<i>I wanted to become
a police officer too.</i>

01:15.420 --> 01:17.284
To help people.

01:17.318 --> 01:19.424
I can't share any details,

01:19.458 --> 01:20.942
but we might be looking
into Vella.

01:20.977 --> 01:23.117
Great. So, either
I'm accused of being a traitor

01:23.152 --> 01:25.326
or I become one
to avoid being accused?

01:25.361 --> 01:27.259
We really can't be sure about

01:27.294 --> 01:28.812
the loyalty
of some of these people.

01:28.847 --> 01:30.159
They could banjax
the whole thing.

01:32.575 --> 01:34.784
I sent a photo
to the Handler.

01:34.818 --> 01:36.855
He confirms it's the CHIS.

01:36.889 --> 01:39.168
You're not suggesting
Davidson was involved?

01:39.202 --> 01:41.342
You have no idea
what she's capable of.

01:43.793 --> 01:45.277
It's over.

01:45.312 --> 01:46.692
How come
I've never met your family?

01:46.727 --> 01:48.315
I don't have one.

01:50.731 --> 01:52.526
I've released him
without charge.

01:52.560 --> 01:54.562
No way am I going after
someone like Terry Boyle

01:54.597 --> 01:56.737
because he's the easy way out.

01:56.771 --> 01:58.946
Boss, is everything okay?

01:58.980 --> 02:00.982
I should, er...
-Yeah.

02:16.757 --> 02:18.793
Sir.

02:18.828 --> 02:20.174
Skipper...

02:21.865 --> 02:23.212
Good Morning.

02:26.215 --> 02:28.562
Thank you as you were.
As you were.

02:28.596 --> 02:32.290
I have authorised
an official AC-12 inquiry

02:32.324 --> 02:33.739
into Operation Lighthouse.

02:33.774 --> 02:35.845
Gail Vella's murder

02:35.879 --> 02:38.848
is this force's highest
profile investigation.

02:38.882 --> 02:40.608
It will be our job to detect

02:40.643 --> 02:42.921
whether police misconduct
and/or corruption

02:42.955 --> 02:46.373
has contributed to this murder
remaining unsolved.

02:47.650 --> 02:49.583
-DS Arnott.
-Sir.

02:50.929 --> 02:52.793
SIO on Lighthouse

02:52.827 --> 02:55.554
is Detective Chief Inspector
Joanne Davidson.

02:55.589 --> 02:57.349
No MIT officers are aware

02:57.384 --> 02:59.558
AC-12 is scrutinising
Lighthouse.

02:59.593 --> 03:01.560
All information
we've harvested so far

03:01.595 --> 03:02.803
has been acquired
from a source

03:02.837 --> 03:04.977
on The Hill
known as Officer J.

03:11.363 --> 03:13.020
...to our inquiry.

03:13.054 --> 03:16.541
The CHIS's name
22.

03:16.575 --> 03:19.751
Oldroyd was in a pub
on the night of October 26th

03:19.785 --> 03:21.787
when the person
calling himself Ross Turner

03:21.822 --> 03:24.411
gave Oldroyd homophobic abuse.

03:24.445 --> 03:26.240
Turner intimidated Oldroyd

03:26.275 --> 03:28.000
by allegedly boasting
of involvement

03:28.035 --> 03:29.726
in Gail Vella's murder.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.051
Sorry, sir,

03:44.085 --> 03:45.742
-have you got a sec?
-Come in.

03:45.777 --> 03:48.469
You don't need me to tell you
we need a witness

03:48.504 --> 03:50.368
to this meeting
between Oldroyd and Turner

03:50.402 --> 03:53.025
to identify whether
it was Boyle or Banks.

03:53.060 --> 03:56.097
Unfortunately, the CHIS lied
about the name of the pub.

03:56.132 --> 03:57.651
Handler believes
he was protecting friends

03:57.685 --> 03:59.584
who trade drugs there.
We're checking out

03:59.618 --> 04:01.413
establishments in the vicinity
of Beechwood House

04:01.448 --> 04:04.589
for CCTV plus Local Authority
cameras in the area

04:04.623 --> 04:06.349
just in the hope
of identifying Oldroyd,

04:06.384 --> 04:08.662
Banks or Boyle
on the night of the 26th.

04:08.696 --> 04:11.423
-Cheers, Chris, crack on.
-Boss.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.356
Thanks.
-Ma'am.

04:14.909 --> 04:16.394
Boss, obviously
we've got to consider

04:16.428 --> 04:18.327
whether Oldroyd's death
was suicide or murder...

04:18.361 --> 04:19.983
Hence, we're investigating it.

04:20.018 --> 04:22.365
Yeah. I'm not saying anything
you don't know already, boss,

04:22.400 --> 04:24.367
but if it was murder
then it raises the question

04:24.402 --> 04:26.058
that someone knew Oldroyd
had info

04:26.093 --> 04:28.475
on Gail Vella's death.

04:28.509 --> 04:29.993
I know.

04:30.028 --> 04:31.616
Hate to say it, Kate,

04:31.650 --> 04:33.583
but one thing I've learned
over the years,

04:33.618 --> 04:35.758
the fewer coppers
in the loop, the better.

05:01.818 --> 05:03.475
What's going on
with Farida Jatri?

05:03.510 --> 05:05.374
I was about to ask the same,
sir.

05:05.408 --> 05:07.445
She's just handed
in a transfer request.

05:07.479 --> 05:09.412
"Personal reasons."

05:09.447 --> 05:11.483
She's an experienced PS.

05:11.518 --> 05:13.313
We're at a crucial phase
of Vella.

05:16.488 --> 05:17.800
In confidence, sir,

05:17.834 --> 05:20.423
I've noticed some issues
with PS Jatri.

05:20.458 --> 05:22.667
What kind of issues?

05:22.701 --> 05:24.876
I don't want to say anything

05:24.910 --> 05:26.533
that might come back
to haunt us.

05:26.567 --> 05:28.569
Last thing you need's
a tribunal.

05:28.604 --> 05:30.606
What?

05:30.640 --> 05:32.815
I'll draft a glowing reference

05:32.849 --> 05:34.989
and she'll be
some other station's problem.

05:36.991 --> 05:38.441
You're a lifesaver.

05:39.718 --> 05:40.926
Yeah.

05:51.005 --> 05:52.490
-Sir.
-What have you got?

05:52.524 --> 05:53.801
Sir, the team have managed
to pull

05:53.836 --> 05:55.803
some Gail Vella reports
from our archive.

05:55.838 --> 05:58.599
Obviously they all relate
to cases involving AC-12.

06:00.463 --> 06:02.810
<i>-Chief Inspector...
-Chief Inspector Osbourne!</i>

06:04.571 --> 06:05.813
<i>I take pride</i>

06:05.848 --> 06:07.056
<i>in the courage
and professionalism</i>

06:07.090 --> 06:09.058
<i>of my counterterrorism
officers.</i>

06:09.092 --> 06:11.888
<i>To say any more risks
prejudicing the inquest.</i>

06:11.923 --> 06:13.096
<i>Thank you.</i>

06:15.098 --> 06:16.859
<i>Official police statements
record</i>

06:16.893 --> 06:19.793
<i>Counter Terrorism Officers
shouted "Armed Police"</i>

06:19.827 --> 06:22.416
<i>and ordered Mr Ali
to surrender.</i>

06:22.451 --> 06:25.246
<i>Mr Ali's widow Aaliyah
insists there was no warning,</i>

06:25.281 --> 06:27.525
<i>no chance to surrender,
before her husband</i>

06:27.559 --> 06:29.596
<i>was gunned down
by a hail of bullets.</i>

06:29.630 --> 06:31.839
They lied through their teeth,

06:31.874 --> 06:34.428
every single one of them,
except you, Steve.

06:34.463 --> 06:35.843
I mean, talk about an outrage,

06:35.878 --> 06:37.604
the commanding officer,
made Chief.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.571
If that had happened
on my patch...

06:39.606 --> 06:41.677
Jesus.

06:41.711 --> 06:42.988
Next one, Chloe.

06:54.655 --> 06:57.037
<i>A jury found Retired
Chief Superintendent</i>

06:57.071 --> 07:00.558
<i>Patrick Fairbank
guilty of all charges.</i>

07:00.592 --> 07:01.835
<i>What that jury didn't hear</i>

07:01.869 --> 07:04.009
<i>and only now
am I allowed to report</i>

07:04.044 --> 07:05.839
<i>are allegations
Patrick Fairbank</i>

07:05.873 --> 07:07.875
<i>suppressed police investigations</i>

07:07.910 --> 07:09.670
<i>into child sexual
exploitation</i>

07:09.705 --> 07:11.707
<i>that transcended
local political figures</i>

07:11.741 --> 07:13.812
<i>such as Councillor
Dale Roach.</i>

07:13.847 --> 07:15.883
<i>It's now a matter
of public record</i>

07:15.918 --> 07:18.058
<i>that Jimmy Savile
cultivated relationships</i>

07:18.092 --> 07:20.025
<i>with senior police officers.</i>

07:20.060 --> 07:21.855
<i>Savile exploited
those relationships</i>

07:21.889 --> 07:23.512
<i>to intimidate anyone</i>

07:23.546 --> 07:26.100
<i>attempting to investigate
his offending.</i>

07:26.135 --> 07:28.068
<i>We now realise
what Savile was getting</i>

07:28.102 --> 07:31.036
<i>out of those relationships
with senior police officers.</i>

07:31.071 --> 07:34.281
<i>What remains unknown,
and uninvestigated,</i>

07:34.315 --> 07:35.834
<i>is what those officers
were getting</i>

07:35.869 --> 07:38.043
<i>out of their relationship
with Savile.</i>

07:38.078 --> 07:39.769
<i>Gail Vella reporting</i>

07:39.804 --> 07:41.737
<i>from Queen Elizabeth
Law Courts.</i>

07:41.771 --> 07:43.117
Sir, Gail Vella drew attention

07:43.152 --> 07:44.878
to alleged links
between organised crime,

07:44.912 --> 07:46.949
politicians and senior police officers

07:46.983 --> 07:49.745
and these are just the reports
we found in our own archive.

07:51.988 --> 07:54.508
Wee girl killed in cold blood.

07:55.992 --> 07:57.891
Or a killer, free as a bird.

08:00.790 --> 08:02.620
-Thank you, Chloe.
-Sir.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.211
-Cheers, Chloe.
Sarge.

08:12.906 --> 08:14.632
Gaffer, it can't be
a coincidence

08:14.666 --> 08:15.840
Carl Banks
was a violent offender

08:15.874 --> 08:17.186
involved with organised crime.

08:17.220 --> 08:19.050
Yeah, but if your man
pulled the trigger,

08:19.084 --> 08:21.086
that means
he's a gun for hire.

08:21.121 --> 08:22.709
That order came
from higher up.

08:22.743 --> 08:25.056
But the question still remains

08:25.090 --> 08:27.299
what is the motive
for Gail Vella's murder?

08:27.334 --> 08:28.956
All right, she's
a controversial journalist,

08:28.991 --> 08:31.269
I'll give you that,
but there's no evidence

08:31.303 --> 08:32.684
to suggest
that she dug up anything

08:32.719 --> 08:34.065
that wasn't there before.

08:34.099 --> 08:37.240
Maybe she was working
on something that would...

08:43.074 --> 08:45.525
Superintendent Hastings.

08:50.184 --> 08:51.531
Thanks Steve. Thanks.

08:53.118 --> 08:54.568
Sir.

08:54.603 --> 08:56.363
Yes. I'll be right down.

09:11.861 --> 09:13.207
Steph,
what are you doing here?

09:13.242 --> 09:14.830
You promised
you'd call me back. It's HMRC.

09:14.864 --> 09:16.245
Not here, not here,

09:16.279 --> 09:17.902
let's go somewhere private.

09:53.765 --> 09:55.042
-Tea, coffee?
-We're fine.

09:55.077 --> 09:57.044
-Thanks though.
-Cool.

09:57.079 --> 10:00.392
-So, have a seat.
-Yes.

10:00.427 --> 10:02.153
How can I help you?

10:02.187 --> 10:05.052
We'd like to ask you some
questions about Gail Vella.

10:05.087 --> 10:06.260
You were working
with her closely

10:06.295 --> 10:07.779
at the time of her death?

10:07.814 --> 10:09.816
Detectives interviewed me
a few days after.

10:09.850 --> 10:13.336
Our department is conducting
further inquiries.

10:13.371 --> 10:16.477
Yeah. I was her producer
for a couple of years.

10:16.512 --> 10:18.376
One line of inquiry
is she fell victim

10:18.410 --> 10:19.895
to an obsessed fan.

10:19.929 --> 10:21.103
Do you recall any individuals

10:21.137 --> 10:22.898
that gave Gail
cause for concern?

10:22.932 --> 10:24.831
Female journalists
get the worst of it.

10:24.865 --> 10:27.143
From accusations of bias
to threats of sexual violence.

10:27.178 --> 10:28.351
Everything was reported
at the time

10:28.386 --> 10:30.146
to our security
or to the police.

10:30.181 --> 10:31.665
You say Ms Vella
received threats

10:31.700 --> 10:33.322
as a result of her reporting.

10:33.356 --> 10:35.635
Were there any particularly
controversial reports?

10:38.016 --> 10:39.224
Maybe I should show you.

10:40.881 --> 10:42.400
<i>The Deputy Chief Constable
and I</i>

10:42.434 --> 10:44.402
<i>are pleased to report

10:44.436 --> 10:46.853
<i>has completed

<i>into institutionalised
complicity</i>

10:48.924 --> 10:51.271
<i>between organised criminals
and corrupt police officers.</i>

10:51.305 --> 10:54.723
<i>It's robust findings
couldn't be clearer.</i>

10:54.757 --> 10:57.001
<i>There is no institutionalised
corruption</i>

10:57.035 --> 10:58.519
<i>in this police force.</i>

11:00.211 --> 11:02.903
<i>Operation Pear Tree,

11:02.938 --> 11:04.905
<i>"the most thorough"

11:04.940 --> 11:07.977
<i>into police corruption,

11:08.012 --> 11:10.221
<i>Some will wonder why
this news</i>

11:10.255 --> 11:12.982
<i>is being announced
over a holiday weekend.</i>

11:13.017 --> 11:14.466
<i>Cynics might conclude
the Police</i>

11:14.501 --> 11:17.055
<i>and Crime Commissioner
would prefer his statement</i>

11:17.090 --> 11:19.437
<i>isn't examined too closely.</i>

11:19.471 --> 11:21.266
<i>Perhaps Mr Sindwhani
has learned</i>

11:21.301 --> 11:24.062
<i>the secret to high office
appears no longer to reside</i>

11:24.097 --> 11:25.512
<i>in revealing

11:28.377 --> 11:30.137
<i>Gail Vella reporting...</i>

11:30.172 --> 11:32.174
I had to cut that
from the broadcast version.

11:32.208 --> 11:34.107
This unbroadcast material,

11:34.141 --> 11:35.453
it would never
have been released?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.248
Not in this form, no.

11:37.282 --> 11:39.457
She'd seen the success
of a podcast

11:39.491 --> 11:41.770
about police corruption
surrounding the murder

11:41.804 --> 11:43.737
of a private detective,
Daniel Morgan.

11:43.772 --> 11:45.187
The material Gail
couldn't get on air,

11:45.221 --> 11:47.465
she was funnelling into
a podcast serial of her own.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.812
Where can we access
this podcast?

11:49.847 --> 11:52.056
It never got that far. Gail
must not have finished it.

11:52.090 --> 11:54.023
Do you know anything about
the content of this podcast?

11:54.058 --> 11:55.335
I know she was pursuing

11:55.369 --> 11:57.337
several senior police officers
for interviews.

11:57.371 --> 11:59.166
She was digging
much more deeply into why

11:59.201 --> 12:00.789
there'd been suppression
of police inquiries

12:00.823 --> 12:03.101
into the likes
of Councillor Dale Roach.

12:03.136 --> 12:04.516
She keep notes or recordings?

12:04.551 --> 12:07.002
Yes. What journalist wouldn't?

12:07.036 --> 12:08.210
That's why I suggested
Gail's killer

12:08.244 --> 12:10.419
must have stolen them.

12:10.453 --> 12:12.283
Sorry? You disclosed this

12:12.317 --> 12:13.767
to the original
murder detectives?

12:13.802 --> 12:15.148
And they said
there was no grounds

12:15.182 --> 12:16.770
to suspect a burglary.

12:20.084 --> 12:21.533
This is the first
we've heard of burglary

12:21.568 --> 12:23.018
being a factor
in Gail Vella's murder.

12:23.052 --> 12:24.467
Nor was there evidence
of a disturbance

12:24.502 --> 12:25.952
inside of the property.

12:25.986 --> 12:27.816
If the killer stole something,
he knew exactly

12:27.850 --> 12:29.196
what he was looking for
and where to find it.

12:29.231 --> 12:30.991
I'm assuming the original
investigation

12:31.026 --> 12:33.373
seized all of Gail Vella's
electronic devices.

12:33.407 --> 12:34.546
Yes, sir.
They were after messages

12:34.581 --> 12:36.203
or threats
from an obsessed fan.

12:36.238 --> 12:37.929
Yes, but they weren't looking
at her journalism.

12:37.964 --> 12:40.035
If your theory is right,
Steve,

12:40.069 --> 12:41.622
these files could point
the finger at someone

12:41.657 --> 12:44.315
who may have had a motive
to order her murder.

12:44.349 --> 12:46.904
I think those devices
need to be re-analysed.

12:46.938 --> 12:48.112
We'll have to find
a way to do that

12:48.146 --> 12:50.183
without alerting Davidson.

12:50.217 --> 12:51.391
Right.

12:51.425 --> 12:52.772
Thank you, Chloe.

12:54.532 --> 12:55.878
Sir.

13:04.128 --> 13:05.957
You're worried about
what might happen to Kate

13:05.992 --> 13:08.201
when Davidson finds out
we're investigating her?

13:08.235 --> 13:10.030
-Yes, sir.
-I get it, son, I really do.

13:10.065 --> 13:12.377
I get it. But...

13:12.412 --> 13:14.069
Kate has made her bed.

13:14.103 --> 13:15.553
Now she's got to lie in it.

13:15.587 --> 13:17.279
And we've a job to do.

13:18.901 --> 13:20.178
Sir.

13:20.213 --> 13:21.559
Wait, Steve.

13:26.288 --> 13:28.635
I've been giving the situation
some thought.

13:30.016 --> 13:31.949
And loyalty works both ways.

13:31.983 --> 13:34.675
I'm gonna have to confirm it
with HR

13:34.710 --> 13:37.368
but ahead of the formal
promotion process,

13:37.402 --> 13:39.473
I am making you a Temp DI.

13:41.717 --> 13:44.996
Congratulations, son,
you've earned it.

13:45.031 --> 13:47.205
Thank you, sir.

14:28.281 --> 14:31.629
All right.

14:32.768 --> 14:34.080
Just like old times.

14:34.114 --> 14:35.460
Yeah.

14:36.668 --> 14:38.567
We're moving forward
with Vella.

14:38.601 --> 14:40.396
Moving forward how?

14:40.431 --> 14:42.122
At some point we're gonna hit
the Hill.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.193
Shit, for Christ sake,
Steve.

14:44.228 --> 14:46.057
This is why I got you here.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.990
I can't leave a digital trail.
But I wanted you to know.

14:48.025 --> 14:49.543
Why are you involving me?

14:49.578 --> 14:53.202
We've got some leads,
but look, Kate,

14:53.237 --> 14:55.411
if you can feed me
the inside track on Davidson,

14:55.446 --> 14:56.999
maybe we won't need
to show our hand just yet...

14:57.034 --> 14:58.656
Christ sake, Steve,
she's me gaffer,

14:58.690 --> 15:01.210
-you want me to rat on her?
-You're no rat if she's bent.

15:01.245 --> 15:03.247
-What am I then?
-An honest copper.

15:03.281 --> 15:05.214
Oh yeah, I'm sure
everyone'll see it like that.

15:05.249 --> 15:07.734
Look, Kate,
it goes beyond Davidson.

15:07.768 --> 15:09.563
If organised crime ordered
the murder of Gail Vella,

15:09.598 --> 15:11.980
they're protecting Carl Banks
and framing Terry Boyle.

15:12.014 --> 15:14.499
Yeah, we get it.
We're working on it.

15:14.534 --> 15:16.329
Look,
I just need to know when.

15:16.363 --> 15:17.640
When is it going
to come out that AC-12

15:17.675 --> 15:19.642
are investigating Davidson?

15:19.677 --> 15:22.024
I've already said too much.

15:22.059 --> 15:23.405
Yeah, likewise.

15:26.787 --> 15:28.720
You always chose
a right shithole.

15:49.845 --> 15:51.364
All right, Chris.

15:51.398 --> 15:52.779
Pathologist's
in there now, boss.

15:52.813 --> 15:54.436
Knife wound to the throat.

15:54.470 --> 15:56.541
Looks like the body's
been here for a few days.

15:56.576 --> 15:58.095
Witnesses?

15:58.129 --> 15:59.372
This is a long derelict site

15:59.406 --> 16:01.719
with no security presence
and no CCTV.

16:01.753 --> 16:04.584
Highly unlikely we'll harvest
any surveillance images.

16:04.618 --> 16:06.724
Any ID yet?

16:06.758 --> 16:09.623
Matches the appearance
of Carl Banks.

16:15.077 --> 16:16.251
Shit.

16:16.285 --> 16:18.011
Good news, ma'am.

16:18.046 --> 16:19.288
The search team's found
a knife.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.603
No apparent blood
deposits on the ground.

16:23.637 --> 16:25.156
The Best test for them anyway.

16:25.191 --> 16:26.364
The killer didn't put
much effort

16:26.399 --> 16:28.021
into evidence disposal.

16:30.817 --> 16:33.199
DI Fleming.
Farida's replacement,

16:33.233 --> 16:35.856
-PC Ryan...
-Pilkington, ma'am.

16:35.891 --> 16:37.548
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

16:37.582 --> 16:40.206
Don't knock it, Kate.
We're overdue a lucky break.

16:40.240 --> 16:41.759
-Thanks, Ryan.
Ma'am.

16:51.389 --> 16:52.873
Fingerprints were only
a 90% match

16:52.908 --> 16:55.359
due to early decomposition
but DNA's confirmed

16:55.393 --> 16:56.670
the body is definitely
Carl Banks.

16:56.705 --> 16:58.638
Sorry, ma'am,

16:58.672 --> 17:00.088
you asked to receive
the forensic report

17:00.122 --> 17:02.090
-as soon as it was in.
-Thanks, Ryan.

17:02.124 --> 17:04.299
You couldn't do us a cuppa,
could you? I'm gasping.

17:04.333 --> 17:05.610
Yeah.
No problem at all, ma'am.

17:05.645 --> 17:07.750
-DI Fleming, DS Lomax?
-I'm fine, ta.

17:07.785 --> 17:10.512
Me too but this has been
bugging me,

17:10.546 --> 17:12.445
have we worked together
before?

17:12.479 --> 17:15.310
Did you come and give a talk
at Training College, ma'am?

17:15.344 --> 17:17.312
No.

17:17.346 --> 17:19.417
Thanks, Ryan.
-Ma'am.

17:21.454 --> 17:23.145
Christ sake.

17:23.180 --> 17:24.767
Boss?

17:24.802 --> 17:27.391
Fingerprints on the knife
found close to Carl Banks's

17:27.425 --> 17:30.877
body match Alastair Oldroyd.
The CHIS.

17:30.911 --> 17:32.637
The pathologist confirmed
Banks died

17:32.672 --> 17:34.432
a couple of days earlier.
The timeline works

17:34.467 --> 17:35.640
for Oldroyd
to have killed Banks.

17:35.675 --> 17:37.159
Yeah.

17:37.194 --> 17:38.919
Sarge.

17:38.954 --> 17:40.473
Err, I mean Sir.

17:47.445 --> 17:51.242
-Shit. Sir.
-What have you got?

17:51.277 --> 17:52.864
Sir, it's just come up
on the Box.

17:52.899 --> 17:55.108
Carl Banks
has been found dead.

17:55.143 --> 17:56.661
No more beating
about the bush.

17:56.696 --> 17:59.526
-We raid Operation Lighthouse.
-Sir.

17:59.561 --> 18:01.804
I'll put together a team
and transport.

18:10.606 --> 18:12.298
AC-12, DI Arnott.

18:12.332 --> 18:14.334
It's your lawful duty
to comply with my officers.

18:14.369 --> 18:15.577
Sir.

18:44.261 --> 18:45.848
DI Arnott, AC-12.

18:45.883 --> 18:47.954
We have the lawful
authority to investigate

18:47.988 --> 18:49.473
Operation Lighthouse.

18:49.507 --> 18:51.475
All officers go to your desks.

18:51.509 --> 18:53.925
You'll each be questioned
by an AC-12 case worker.

18:53.960 --> 18:56.273
You'll each be obliged
to surrender all materials

18:56.307 --> 18:57.791
relating to Operation Lighthouse

18:57.826 --> 18:59.517
to said case workers.

18:59.552 --> 19:01.795
Failure to comply will be
a breach of your Duties

19:01.830 --> 19:04.557
and Responsibilities under
Police Conduct Regulations

19:04.591 --> 19:06.352
and may lead
to a misconduct charge

19:06.386 --> 19:08.837
-under said regulations.
Nobody move.

19:08.871 --> 19:10.425
What the hell's
all this about?

19:10.459 --> 19:12.289
-On whose authority?
-We have a signed authority

19:12.323 --> 19:13.876
from Deputy Chief
Constable Wise to seize

19:13.911 --> 19:17.432
all MIT files relating
to the murder of Gail Vella.

19:17.466 --> 19:18.950
Let me see that.

19:18.985 --> 19:20.745
Sir, as you know,
willful obstruction

19:20.780 --> 19:22.782
of my officers executing
their lawful duty

19:22.816 --> 19:25.474
-is a criminal offence.
-DCI Davidson.

19:25.509 --> 19:29.237
I notified the DCC
of my concerns regarding

19:29.271 --> 19:31.584
leaking of confidential
police information

19:31.618 --> 19:34.207
such as the operation
to arrest Ross Turner

19:34.242 --> 19:35.484
and the identity of the CHIS

19:35.519 --> 19:37.521
who gave us Turner's name
and address.

19:37.555 --> 19:40.317
The DCC agreed
to a moratorium

19:40.351 --> 19:41.594
on further distribution

19:41.628 --> 19:42.974
of Operation Lighthouse files

19:43.009 --> 19:44.631
until said information leakage

19:44.666 --> 19:46.426
has been fully investigated.

19:46.461 --> 19:48.014
We'd be the ones
to investigate it!

19:48.048 --> 19:50.913
Nonetheless you'll see
the DCC's authorised me

19:50.948 --> 19:52.846
to withhold Operation
Lighthouse files.

19:52.881 --> 19:54.779
Why didn't the DCC
inform us about this?

19:54.814 --> 19:57.610
To prevent information
leakage, naturally.

19:57.644 --> 20:00.371
No, he did it
to make mugs of AC-12.

20:00.406 --> 20:02.408
That was just an added bonus.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.036
-Priceless!
-Let's go.

20:10.070 --> 20:11.693
Right, everyone, let's go.

20:23.463 --> 20:25.293
Cheers, Kate, nice one.

20:38.858 --> 20:40.825
How did Davidson know?

20:40.860 --> 20:42.068
Give me a minute.

20:55.909 --> 20:57.083
Steve. I'm sorry.

20:57.117 --> 20:58.740
I trusted you, mate.

20:58.774 --> 21:01.329
Look. I'm damned if I do,
I'm damned if I don't.

21:01.363 --> 21:02.675
What was I supposed to do?

21:18.725 --> 21:21.763
Andrea advised me this is
about Operation Lighthouse.

21:21.797 --> 21:23.558
I need to be in the loop.

21:23.592 --> 21:25.594
Well, I am here
because AC-12's

21:25.629 --> 21:29.667
lawful investigation
has been unjustly obstructed.

21:29.702 --> 21:32.360
Operation Lighthouse
has had its setbacks of course

21:32.394 --> 21:35.086
but your involvement
needs to be correctly handled

21:35.121 --> 21:37.399
so the public don't leap
to the wrong conclusion.

21:37.434 --> 21:40.920
I've briefed Andrea
on the required optics.

21:40.954 --> 21:42.611
This isn't an inquiry

21:42.646 --> 21:45.752
into misconduct
slash corruption.

21:45.787 --> 21:49.687
Well, the investigation
usually precedes the findings.

21:49.722 --> 21:51.655
Clearly, we're all frustrated

21:51.689 --> 21:54.865
Gail Vella's murderer hasn't
been brought to justice yet,

21:54.899 --> 21:58.455
so it makes sense to pitch
AC-12's involvement

21:58.489 --> 22:00.491
as a routine performance
review.

22:02.562 --> 22:05.841
Officers of your rank
normally appreciate politics

22:05.876 --> 22:07.049
as much as policing.

22:07.084 --> 22:09.569
Yes.

22:09.604 --> 22:12.917
I'm interested in one thing
and one thing only.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.367
And that's bent coppers.

22:15.748 --> 22:17.612
I hope you'll cooperate,
Superintendent.

22:17.646 --> 22:20.511
Now, apologies,
if you'll excuse me,

22:20.546 --> 22:22.168
I'm due to attend
the Crime Executive.

22:22.202 --> 22:23.549
Sir.

22:26.862 --> 22:30.003
Unless there are
any outstanding issues, Ted,

22:30.038 --> 22:32.730
I'm prepared to reissue
the authority for AC-12

22:32.765 --> 22:36.562
to proceed with your review
of Operation Lighthouse.

22:36.596 --> 22:38.426
It appears my team
have been delayed

22:38.460 --> 22:40.531
for nothing better
than a PR briefing,

22:40.566 --> 22:43.396
the result of which
is that MIT officers

22:43.431 --> 22:45.467
are now aware of our inquiry

22:45.502 --> 22:48.574
and may be concealing evidence
as we speak!

22:48.608 --> 22:50.714
No one's concealing evidence,
Ted.

22:50.748 --> 22:52.025
They're working their
bollocks off

22:52.060 --> 22:53.682
trying to find
Gail Vella's killer.

22:53.717 --> 22:55.753
Ma'am.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.900
How'd it go, sir?

23:04.935 --> 23:06.971
Well. We're back in business.

23:07.006 --> 23:08.559
Thank you, sir.

23:08.594 --> 23:10.906
So, you make the mess

23:10.941 --> 23:13.219
and I tidy it up,
is that how this goes?

23:14.807 --> 23:15.980
Well, you're not denying it

23:16.015 --> 23:17.223
so it must have been
Officer J.

23:17.257 --> 23:19.881
or DI Kate Fleming
who blew the gaff.

23:19.915 --> 23:21.641
I reckon
you'd only trust Kate

23:21.676 --> 23:24.126
with that kind of information,
yeah?

23:24.161 --> 23:26.508
Well, she's cooked
her goose now,

23:26.543 --> 23:28.476
God help her if she thinks
she's gonna get

23:28.510 --> 23:30.063
some kind of special treatment
from me,

23:30.098 --> 23:31.582
because she's got
another thing coming.

23:31.617 --> 23:33.826
As for DCI Davidson,
she must have had

23:33.860 --> 23:36.725
great fun pulling this stroke.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.831
But she will be laughing
on the other side of her face

23:38.865 --> 23:40.557
when I'm finished with her.

23:40.591 --> 23:43.111
Serve her with a Reg 15.

23:43.145 --> 23:44.975
-Sir.
Carry on.

24:26.810 --> 24:28.570
DC Bishop, AC-12.

24:28.605 --> 24:30.089
I'm sure you can all guess
what this is about.

24:30.123 --> 24:31.815
I need access
to your computer.

24:31.849 --> 24:33.713
Could you stand up,
please.

24:35.197 --> 24:37.061
Show me your files, please.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.135
Can I have your passwords,
please.

24:42.170 --> 24:43.792
I need your login
details.

24:48.107 --> 24:50.143
What is this document here?

24:50.178 --> 24:51.524
Here you go, sir.

24:55.977 --> 24:59.049
Ma'am, please find enclosed
a Regulation 15 notice

24:59.083 --> 25:01.810
requiring you to attend
AC-12 for a formal interview

25:01.845 --> 25:03.329
within the next
10 working days.

25:05.296 --> 25:06.815
A copy of this letter
has been sent

25:06.850 --> 25:09.059
to your Police Federation
Representative.

25:54.449 --> 25:57.590
-Steve?
-I was up on a case.

25:57.625 --> 25:59.419
I'm sorry, Steph,
I should've called.

25:59.454 --> 26:01.767
No, no, it's fine, come in.

26:07.393 --> 26:09.360
-Tea, isn't it?
-Yeah. Ta.

26:12.778 --> 26:14.124
How are the girls?

26:14.158 --> 26:17.610
Gemma still doesn't get it,
not really.

26:17.645 --> 26:19.094
I'm dreading her
not remembering her daddy.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.820
These'll help.

26:20.855 --> 26:22.166
John won't be forgotten.

26:23.789 --> 26:26.239
Thanks for all you did
at the time.

26:26.274 --> 26:27.689
You didn't have to.

26:29.449 --> 26:32.142
I'd like to think he'd
have done the same for me.

26:32.176 --> 26:34.938
He died in the line of duty.

26:34.972 --> 26:37.699
Shame the big bosses
never saw it that way.

26:39.252 --> 26:41.116
Sorry, I ought to know,
milk and sugar?

26:41.151 --> 26:42.946
Just milk, please.

26:52.093 --> 26:53.957
It's good you were able
to keep the house.

26:53.991 --> 26:55.648
I know you were worried.

26:55.683 --> 26:57.685
Tearing me hair out more like.

26:57.719 --> 27:00.101
Fortunately, there was
John's life insurance.

27:02.275 --> 27:03.622
Nice TV.

27:04.933 --> 27:06.763
Champions' League game's
on later.

27:06.797 --> 27:08.143
Not that you lot've got
an interest.

27:08.178 --> 27:09.973
Next season.

27:10.007 --> 27:12.423
I didn't know you'd bother
with the sports channels.

27:12.458 --> 27:15.495
It all comes in a package.
Cheap as chips.

27:15.530 --> 27:18.429
Sorry, what am I like?
Sit down.

27:23.089 --> 27:25.851
-Steve?

27:27.300 --> 27:29.855
It's just a spasm. It'll pass.

27:29.889 --> 27:31.788
You sure?

27:33.962 --> 27:35.343
I've got some painkillers
in the car.

27:35.377 --> 27:37.138
Don't move. I'll get them.

27:37.172 --> 27:38.726
I'll get your car keys.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.037
Inside pocket.

28:25.255 --> 28:28.914
I can't believe the DCC
caved so easily.

28:28.948 --> 28:30.985
Sorry, boss.

28:32.227 --> 28:33.746
Not your fault at all.

28:33.781 --> 28:35.334
Thanks for the heads-up.

28:35.368 --> 28:37.888
I know the kind of cases
that AC-12 are into, boss.

28:40.373 --> 28:42.341
Out of work, forget "Boss".

28:47.277 --> 28:48.485
You all right?

28:51.522 --> 28:55.216
-This Reg 15...
-Yeah.

28:55.250 --> 28:57.252
I know how it must feel,

28:57.287 --> 29:00.048
but it's just the way
AC-12 operate.

29:02.948 --> 29:04.190
Truth is,

29:04.225 --> 29:06.606
it's all getting
a bit tense.

29:06.641 --> 29:08.608
How's it make me look,
investigating a guy

29:08.643 --> 29:11.370
with learning difficulties...

29:11.404 --> 29:12.820
Straight up, Jo,

29:12.854 --> 29:14.856
do you think
he could have killed Gail?

29:17.203 --> 29:18.998
You've been doing this job
long enough

29:19.033 --> 29:21.932
to realise we can never know
for sure.

29:21.967 --> 29:24.176
We just gather the evidence,

29:24.210 --> 29:25.556
do our best.

29:26.972 --> 29:28.525
And right now,
my best is nowhere near

29:28.559 --> 29:29.906
good enough.

29:31.631 --> 29:33.806
A young woman...

29:33.841 --> 29:35.256
could've been you or me, Kate,

29:35.290 --> 29:37.085
her life cut short.

29:38.949 --> 29:40.640
And whoever did
it's got away with it,

29:40.675 --> 29:42.263
and that's my fault.

29:44.506 --> 29:45.887
Do you fancy another?

29:45.922 --> 29:47.026
Ladies.

29:48.579 --> 29:49.995
Two more, please.

29:50.029 --> 29:51.203
Can we get those?

29:59.245 --> 30:01.834
Have a good night, guys.

30:01.869 --> 30:03.940
-Two more, please.
Certainly.

30:07.184 --> 30:09.152
I'm sorry, Kate,

30:09.186 --> 30:11.464
my self-pity's
blown your chances.

30:11.499 --> 30:13.432
Na, not really my type.

30:22.165 --> 30:23.511
You sure you're okay
to drive?

30:23.545 --> 30:26.410
Yes. Sorry about all that
earlier. I'm fine.

30:26.445 --> 30:28.447
Last thing I meant
was to put you out.

30:28.481 --> 30:30.311
Gerraway, it was nice
to have some grownup company

30:30.345 --> 30:31.415
for a change.

30:34.522 --> 30:36.455
This a long job?

30:36.489 --> 30:38.077
The case you're up here on?

30:39.492 --> 30:40.977
Could be.

30:41.011 --> 30:43.255
If you're passing again,
don't hesitate.

30:53.265 --> 30:54.645
Don't stay out,
it's freezing,

30:54.680 --> 30:57.683
I've got to set the sat nav
and everything.

30:57.717 --> 31:00.237
Night, Steve, safe journey.

31:01.273 --> 31:02.377
Night.

31:12.974 --> 31:14.976
Thanks for coming out, Kate.

31:15.011 --> 31:17.082
Sorry to unload my problems.

31:17.116 --> 31:19.532
No worries, glad I could be
a sounding board.

31:21.362 --> 31:23.295
Well, this is me.

31:24.744 --> 31:26.608
It's Mark's turn
to have Josh this weekend.

31:26.643 --> 31:27.989
If you're at a loose end...

31:29.991 --> 31:32.235
I need to check my diary.

31:32.269 --> 31:33.650
Yeah. No pressure.

31:43.177 --> 31:45.558
My diary's empty.

31:45.593 --> 31:48.147
I've just come out
of a long-term relationship.

31:48.182 --> 31:49.562
I, uh...

31:55.741 --> 31:58.226
It would be nice
to see you at the weekend.

32:23.562 --> 32:25.322
Chloe, how's it going?

32:25.357 --> 32:26.565
Davidson gave us
full cooperation.

32:26.599 --> 32:27.738
So we got the lot.

32:27.773 --> 32:29.154
We've recovered
Vella's computers

32:29.188 --> 32:30.569
that were seized
straight after her murder.

32:30.603 --> 32:32.122
I thought you'd want
to prioritise them.

32:32.157 --> 32:33.468
-Great. Hi, Amanda.
Hi.

32:33.503 --> 32:35.022
The Digital Forensics Team
have triaged

32:35.056 --> 32:37.127
the desk-top computer,
the lap-top computer.

32:37.162 --> 32:38.611
The truth is,
they're remarkably clean.

32:38.646 --> 32:40.027
What do you mean?

32:40.061 --> 32:41.545
All applications
still had store settings.

32:41.580 --> 32:43.202
Hardly any personal files.

32:43.237 --> 32:44.514
Well they were planted.

32:44.548 --> 32:46.033
Her killer replaced
her actual computers

32:46.067 --> 32:47.310
to cover up the burglary.

32:47.344 --> 32:48.794
I'll order
the keyboards to be swabbed

32:48.828 --> 32:50.520
and screens fingerprinted
that way we can see

32:50.554 --> 32:52.073
if Gail
ever even touched them.

32:52.108 --> 32:53.488
Good call. So,
you've found nothing at all?

32:53.523 --> 32:54.627
The only item of interest

32:54.662 --> 32:56.043
is a tiny audio file.

32:56.077 --> 32:57.527
It appears
only partially downloaded.

32:57.561 --> 32:59.770
How would that happen?
-Going with your theory,

32:59.805 --> 33:01.186
it would be
when the murderer installed

33:01.220 --> 33:02.635
the replacement devices.

33:02.670 --> 33:04.465
They would have synced
to her phone momentarily,

33:04.499 --> 33:05.742
started to import
the audio file

33:05.776 --> 33:07.330
before the murderer
broke the link.

33:07.364 --> 33:10.229
That would involve him
knowing her passwords.

33:10.264 --> 33:11.679
Sorry.

33:11.713 --> 33:13.681
<i>...Savile lied
to cover them up.</i>

33:13.715 --> 33:16.201
<i>Some police officers
not only accepted those lies.</i>

33:16.235 --> 33:17.857
<i>They propagated them.</i>

33:17.892 --> 33:20.239
<i>We're losing our power
to challenge lies.</i>

33:20.274 --> 33:22.345
<i>There's some people
you can't challenge.</i>

33:25.417 --> 33:27.039
<i>Okay. So,</i>

33:27.074 --> 33:29.145
<i>we're losing our power
to challenge lies.</i>

33:29.179 --> 33:31.354
<i>There's some people
you can't challenge.</i>

33:40.087 --> 33:42.192
Sorry, sir.

33:42.227 --> 33:44.470
I didn't think
you'd still be here.

33:44.505 --> 33:46.783
We need to find
the rest of Gail's recordings.

33:46.817 --> 33:48.750
Yeah,
Amanda said she's on it.

33:57.863 --> 33:59.451
D'you mind me
asking, sir,

33:59.485 --> 34:01.384
but why have these
been put up?

34:02.937 --> 34:05.595
The Gaffer's never
going to give it up,

34:05.629 --> 34:07.838
not as long as he still runs
this place.

34:07.873 --> 34:10.738
-And what about you?
-What about me?

34:10.772 --> 34:12.326
Well, do you still believe
there's a fourth man

34:12.360 --> 34:14.466
out there? H?

34:18.642 --> 34:20.265
I've moved on.

34:47.706 --> 34:49.294
That's us now.

35:08.830 --> 35:10.832
Anticorruption Unit 12
interview

35:10.867 --> 35:12.869
of Detective Chief Inspector
Joanne Davidson

35:12.903 --> 35:15.354
in the presence of her Police
Federation Representative

35:15.389 --> 35:18.702
DCI John Rix
by Superintendent Hastings,

35:18.737 --> 35:20.187
Detective Inspector Arnott,

35:20.221 --> 35:23.190
and Detective Constable
Bishop.

35:23.224 --> 35:26.365
Ma'am, this interview relates
to Operation Lighthouse,

35:26.400 --> 35:28.333
the inquiry into the murder
of Gail Vella

35:28.367 --> 35:30.818
on September 10th, 2019,

35:30.852 --> 35:32.820
on which you've been
Senior Investigating Officer

35:32.854 --> 35:35.409
since 6th of October
of that same year.

35:35.443 --> 35:37.411
Document 6
in your folders.

35:37.445 --> 35:39.896
Document 6 is a copy
of an incident report

35:39.930 --> 35:42.278
lawfully seized by AC-12
from the offices

35:42.312 --> 35:43.762
of the Murder
Investigation Team

35:43.796 --> 35:45.660
located at Hillside Lane
Police Station

35:45.695 --> 35:47.386
on the 4th of November.

35:47.421 --> 35:49.457
Said incident report
describes events

35:49.492 --> 35:51.390
on the morning
of 27th October,

35:51.425 --> 35:54.290
specifically the diversion
and delay of an operation

35:54.324 --> 35:56.740
to arrest a suspect
in the murder of Gail Vella

35:56.775 --> 35:58.949
in order to attend
an Armed Robbery taking place

35:58.984 --> 36:01.400
at Hickey's Bookmakers,
Verlaine Road.

36:01.435 --> 36:03.954
On screen, Images 11 to 14.

36:03.989 --> 36:07.682
Images 11 to 14 show
street views of said location.

36:09.028 --> 36:10.858
DCI Davidson,
can you kindly explain

36:10.892 --> 36:12.963
your actions
on the morning of October 27th

36:12.998 --> 36:15.828
in relation
to this Armed Robbery.

36:17.554 --> 36:19.418
En route
to arrest the suspect,

36:19.453 --> 36:21.696
I observed
a suspicious vehicle,

36:21.731 --> 36:24.665
further inquiries detected
an armed robbery in progress.

36:24.699 --> 36:26.805
I ordered my officers
to intervene.

36:26.839 --> 36:29.221
DCI Davidson's actions
prevented a serious

36:29.256 --> 36:31.706
and immediate threat
to members of the public.

36:31.741 --> 36:33.467
Commendable.

36:33.501 --> 36:34.778
DI Arnott.

36:34.813 --> 36:37.471
Image 14 on screen.

36:37.505 --> 36:39.369
Image 14 shows
the line of sight

36:39.404 --> 36:41.060
from the route
of the MIT convoy

36:41.095 --> 36:43.373
to the location
of the suspicious vehicle.

36:43.408 --> 36:45.410
Given you were
a front-facing passenger,

36:45.444 --> 36:46.721
it was a narrow
line of sight.

36:46.756 --> 36:49.724
And plus, you were going
like the clappers.

36:49.759 --> 36:51.761
Nonetheless,
I did see the vehicle,

36:51.795 --> 36:53.935
and as a result,
numerous members of the public

36:53.970 --> 36:56.731
were saved
from a terrifying ordeal.

36:56.766 --> 36:58.733
Oh.

36:58.768 --> 37:00.873
And what was it about
this vehicle?

37:00.908 --> 37:02.634
-Sir?
I mean,

37:02.668 --> 37:04.912
it's just an ordinary van
parked in an ordinary street.

37:04.946 --> 37:07.259
Why give it the time of day?

37:07.294 --> 37:09.986
A registration check
proved suspicious.

37:10.020 --> 37:12.057
Yes, but you only found
that out

37:12.091 --> 37:14.232
after you stopped
to investigate.

37:16.406 --> 37:18.477
It was an idling MPV
parked adjacent

37:18.512 --> 37:19.858
to a bookmakers.

37:19.892 --> 37:21.860
The driver wasn't reading
a newspaper

37:21.894 --> 37:23.448
or messing about on his phone.

37:23.482 --> 37:25.588
His eyes were fixed
on the bookies.

37:25.622 --> 37:28.832
He was alert
for a quick getaway.

37:28.867 --> 37:32.457
And you deduced all that
in the fraction of a second?

37:32.491 --> 37:34.769
Call it a police officer's
instinct.

37:34.804 --> 37:36.323
Oh, yes,
we all get those,

37:36.357 --> 37:38.290
from time-to-time
DCI Davidson.

37:38.325 --> 37:40.913
I might be getting one
right now.

37:40.948 --> 37:42.846
DC Bishop.

37:42.881 --> 37:44.641
We've examined MIT records

37:44.676 --> 37:46.574
in relation
to the Armed Robbery.

37:46.609 --> 37:48.921
Document 12 in your folders

37:48.956 --> 37:52.097
and Image 20 on screen.

37:52.131 --> 37:54.755
Image 20 shows the men
arrested in the act

37:54.789 --> 37:57.309
of conducting an Armed Robbery
of Hickey's Bookmakers

37:57.344 --> 37:59.311
on the 27th of October.

37:59.346 --> 38:00.830
None of these men
has a history

38:00.864 --> 38:02.556
of serious or violent crime.

38:02.590 --> 38:04.661
The robbery took place
early in the morning

38:04.696 --> 38:06.525
when takings
would be at their lowest.

38:06.560 --> 38:07.699
So,
what would you deduce

38:07.733 --> 38:10.564
from these facts,
DCI Davidson?

38:10.598 --> 38:13.636
A group of amateur criminals
attempted an armed robbery

38:13.670 --> 38:15.810
in an amateur fashion.

38:15.845 --> 38:17.778
According to Murder Investigation Team

38:17.812 --> 38:19.952
files lawfully seized
on the 4th of November,

38:19.987 --> 38:21.609
attending the Armed Robbery
on the morning

38:21.644 --> 38:23.473
of the 27th of October
caused a delay

38:23.508 --> 38:25.130
of two hours
and twenty-five minutes

38:25.164 --> 38:27.443
to the operation
planned to arrest a suspect

38:27.477 --> 38:29.721
using the alias Ross Turner
believed to reside

38:29.755 --> 38:32.448
-at Flat 4
-F, Beechwood House,
Moss Heath.

38:32.482 --> 38:35.140
This delay was out
of DCI Davidson's control.

38:35.174 --> 38:36.831
One of the Armed Robbers
was shot dead

38:36.866 --> 38:38.764
by an Authorised
Firearms Officer.

38:38.799 --> 38:40.801
This necessitated
a forensic deployment

38:40.835 --> 38:42.423
and replacement AFOs.

38:42.458 --> 38:43.942
We also understand
that an authority

38:43.976 --> 38:46.945
for Directed Surveillance
applied to Beechwood House.

38:46.979 --> 38:48.429
The required authority
should have been

38:48.464 --> 38:49.982
for Intrusive Surveillance.

38:50.017 --> 38:52.053
As a result,
while the matter was resolved,

38:52.088 --> 38:53.676
surveillance was absent
for a period

38:53.710 --> 38:55.678
of three hours
and thirty-five minutes.

38:55.712 --> 38:57.680
It needed to be resolved.

38:57.714 --> 38:59.958
Any evidence captured
during the wrong authority

38:59.992 --> 39:01.408
would've been inadmissible.

39:01.442 --> 39:03.030
Yeah. Then maybe
it would've been a good idea

39:03.064 --> 39:04.756
to get the right authority
in the first place,

39:04.790 --> 39:06.965
wouldn't you say?

39:06.999 --> 39:08.760
The error in assigning
the wrong

39:08.794 --> 39:10.555
surveillance authority
was committed

39:10.589 --> 39:12.108
by a senior officer.

39:14.110 --> 39:15.456
That isn't in the file.

39:16.837 --> 39:18.528
I chose not to embarrass him.

39:20.150 --> 39:24.016
Now look, DCI Davidson,
we are charged here

39:24.051 --> 39:26.053
with investigating
serious crimes,

39:26.087 --> 39:28.089
not least the murder
of a young woman

39:28.124 --> 39:30.437
in the prime of her life,

39:30.471 --> 39:32.853
and I expect
all policemen and women

39:32.887 --> 39:34.544
to uphold their duty
to the public

39:34.579 --> 39:37.547
above any misguided loyalty
they may have

39:37.582 --> 39:39.515
to their fellow officers.

39:39.549 --> 39:41.965
Now who was
the senior officer?

39:44.002 --> 39:45.624
No comment, sir.

39:47.937 --> 39:51.734
DI Arnott will you bookmark

39:51.768 --> 39:53.460
failure to comply.

39:53.494 --> 39:54.564
Sir.

40:00.156 --> 40:01.537
DC Bishop.

40:02.676 --> 40:04.540
Image 29 on screen.

40:04.574 --> 40:07.266
Please refer to Document 15
in your folders,

40:07.301 --> 40:09.441
a copy of an arrest report
lawfully seized

40:09.476 --> 40:11.029
on the 4th of November.

40:11.063 --> 40:13.238
Said arrest report
describes the arrest

40:13.272 --> 40:17.276
on the 27th of October
-at flat 4
-F, Beechwood House

40:17.311 --> 40:20.038
of a person later
identified as Terry Boyle,

40:20.072 --> 40:22.074
shown on the right
in Image 29.

40:22.109 --> 40:24.629
Also detected at the property
were fingerprints

40:24.663 --> 40:26.700
and DNA deposits
matching Carl Banks,

40:26.734 --> 40:29.150
shown on the left
in Image 29.

40:29.185 --> 40:31.808
Let's start
with Terry Boyle.

40:31.843 --> 40:33.741
According to files
lawfully seized

40:33.776 --> 40:35.053
on November 4th,

40:35.087 --> 40:36.882
a Covert
Human Intelligence Source

40:36.917 --> 40:38.677
submitted information
to his Handler

40:38.712 --> 40:41.024
which was communicated to
the Murder Investigation Team

40:41.059 --> 40:45.581
via a phone call at 23:21
on the 26th October.

40:45.615 --> 40:48.756
The CHIS claimed a person
using the name Ross Turner

40:48.791 --> 40:51.103
had confessed
to the murder of Gail Vella.

40:51.138 --> 40:54.244
Terry Boyle's semen
was detected on images

40:54.279 --> 40:56.592
of Gail Vella found
in his permanent residence

40:56.626 --> 40:57.972
which is located
a short distance

40:58.007 --> 40:59.595
from Gail Vella's home.

40:59.629 --> 41:01.907
Also detected at the property
were chemical traces

41:01.942 --> 41:04.082
of heroin and cocaine and,

41:04.116 --> 41:05.532
on an item
of outer clothing,

41:05.566 --> 41:07.637
particles of gunshot residue.

41:07.672 --> 41:09.846
Incriminating evidence.

41:09.881 --> 41:12.884
Gail Vella's Peugeot 108
was intercepted.

41:12.918 --> 41:14.541
As Ms Vella got out
of the vehicle,

41:14.575 --> 41:16.094
she was murdered
with a single gunshot

41:16.128 --> 41:18.303
carried out
using a hard-contact method

41:18.337 --> 41:19.787
in which the muzzle
of the pistol was forced

41:19.822 --> 41:21.755
against the back
of Ms Vella's head.

41:21.789 --> 41:24.274
This technique confines noise
and gunshot powder.

41:24.309 --> 41:25.828
The murderer
successfully evaded

41:25.862 --> 41:27.761
all neighbourhood
security cameras.

41:27.795 --> 41:29.832
These findings strongly
suggest a contract killing

41:29.866 --> 41:32.524
of the type
ordered by organised crime.

41:32.559 --> 41:35.147
Terry Boyle
has no criminal record,

41:35.182 --> 41:37.287
no known association
with organised crime,

41:37.322 --> 41:38.806
and suffers
from learning difficulties

41:38.841 --> 41:40.670
which raise doubts
regarding his capacity

41:40.705 --> 41:43.880
to commit a cold-blooded
assassination.

41:43.915 --> 41:46.814
The finding of images
of Gail Vella suggested Boyle

41:46.849 --> 41:48.885
was an obsessed fan.

41:48.920 --> 41:51.129
While the hard-contact
technique is associated

41:51.163 --> 41:53.718
with contract killing,
it's not exclusive.

41:53.752 --> 41:55.374
There's no physical reason
an amateur

41:55.409 --> 41:56.928
couldn't do the same.

41:56.962 --> 41:58.585
The particles
of gunshot residue

41:58.619 --> 42:00.276
also link Boyle to the crime.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.864
Well they're below
the threshold amount

42:01.898 --> 42:03.969
you'd expect if Boyle
had been holding the gun,

42:04.004 --> 42:05.592
then add in the total lack
of blood spatter,

42:05.626 --> 42:06.938
there's not even a spot.

42:06.972 --> 42:09.078
That's correct, DI Arnott.

42:09.112 --> 42:11.390
We suspect the coat
was cross contaminated

42:11.425 --> 42:13.703
from Boyle's hands
or other clothing,

42:13.738 --> 42:16.292
clothing he could've disposed
of after the murder.

42:16.326 --> 42:19.019
That's speculation, ma'am.
You've got no evidence.

42:19.053 --> 42:21.608
Which is why
I didn't charge him.

42:27.786 --> 42:28.960
Right,
let's take a look

42:28.994 --> 42:30.651
at this fella Carl Banks.

42:31.756 --> 42:33.240
Image 30 on screen.

42:33.274 --> 42:35.932
Image 30 shows
Carl Banks' criminal record.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.659
Banks has a long association

42:38.694 --> 42:40.661
with organised crime
and a history of violence,

42:40.696 --> 42:42.594
including firearms offences.

42:42.629 --> 42:45.286
Now he fits the profile
of a contract killer.

42:45.321 --> 42:49.221
To use your words, DI Arnott,
"that's speculation."

42:49.256 --> 42:51.776
Also, there's the question
of motive.

42:51.810 --> 42:54.986
Terry Boyle fits the profile
of an obsessed fan.

42:55.020 --> 42:57.057
We've never been able
to identify a motive

42:57.091 --> 42:59.197
for a contract killing
against Gail Vella.

42:59.231 --> 43:01.095
But there's the possibility
Vella was working

43:01.130 --> 43:04.133
on an explosive story,
not only was she executed,

43:04.167 --> 43:05.893
her research was stolen.

43:05.928 --> 43:07.999
A desk-top
and lap-top computer

43:08.033 --> 43:10.380
recovered from the property
and recently re-examined

43:10.415 --> 43:12.900
bear no fingerprints
or DNA deposits

43:12.935 --> 43:14.212
matching Gail Vella.

43:14.246 --> 43:15.800
We believe these items
were planted

43:15.834 --> 43:17.284
to conceal a burglary.

43:19.044 --> 43:20.805
That's not in our files.

43:20.839 --> 43:22.738
No.
But it's in ours.

43:22.772 --> 43:23.980
We're detectives too,
you know.

43:24.015 --> 43:25.913
In case you hadn't noticed.

43:25.948 --> 43:29.054
DCI Davidson has led
an exemplary inquiry.

43:29.089 --> 43:31.401
If you've got new information,
you should share it

43:31.436 --> 43:33.818
with the
Murder Investigation Team.

43:33.852 --> 43:36.821
According to your files,
fingerprints and DNA deposits

43:36.855 --> 43:39.099
matching Banks detected
at Beechwood House

43:39.133 --> 43:41.480
were far more numerous
than those matching Boyle,

43:41.515 --> 43:43.862
suggesting Banks
was the primary resident.

43:43.897 --> 43:45.277
And also detected
at Beechwood House

43:45.312 --> 43:47.417
were signs of forced entry.

43:47.452 --> 43:48.971
Image 37 on screen

43:49.005 --> 43:50.938
is from Carl Banks's
postmortem.

43:50.973 --> 43:53.251
Document 21 in your folders
is a copy

43:53.285 --> 43:54.666
of the postmortem report.

43:54.701 --> 43:56.910
According to said postmortem report,

43:56.944 --> 43:59.844
the pathologist concluded
Carl Banks died

43:59.878 --> 44:02.225
from exsanguination due
to a deep laceration

44:02.260 --> 44:04.883
to the neck most likely
inflicted by a knife.

44:04.918 --> 44:08.093
Also detected on Banks's body
were lacerations and bruising

44:08.128 --> 44:10.164
caused by heavy blunt trauma
to the head,

44:10.199 --> 44:12.028
facial lacerations
and bruising,

44:12.063 --> 44:13.512
and lesions on both wrists

44:13.547 --> 44:15.480
consistent with ligature restraints.

44:15.514 --> 44:17.378
All these injuries
were caused some time

44:17.413 --> 44:19.346
before his death.
And time of death

44:19.380 --> 44:22.487
was put at on or around
the 27th of October.

44:22.521 --> 44:25.801
So, what we have here
is forced entry

44:25.835 --> 44:27.319
into Carl Banks's flat.

44:27.354 --> 44:29.045
Banks beaten unconscious.

44:29.080 --> 44:30.702
His hands tied.

44:30.737 --> 44:32.359
And sometime
later his throat cut.

44:32.393 --> 44:34.223
None of this
could've occurred

44:34.257 --> 44:35.811
without his arrest
being delayed

44:35.845 --> 44:37.260
and the surveillance being
absent.

44:37.295 --> 44:39.504
Now call me suspicious,
DCI Davidson,

44:39.538 --> 44:41.748
but it seems to me
that somebody got wind

44:41.782 --> 44:43.059
that Banks was shooting
his mouth off

44:43.094 --> 44:45.027
about Vella's murder
and they decided

44:45.061 --> 44:46.407
to murder him
to stop him talking.

44:46.442 --> 44:49.065
Not only that,
that they knew...

44:49.100 --> 44:51.136
your team was on course
to arrest him,

44:51.171 --> 44:53.380
they knew the route
you were taking.

44:53.414 --> 44:54.761
And to top it all,

44:54.795 --> 44:56.141
they knew the surveillance
was absent

44:56.176 --> 44:58.247
so that meant,
they could walk in there,

44:58.281 --> 45:00.559
drag Banks out
and substitute him

45:00.594 --> 45:02.320
with Terry Boyle.

45:02.354 --> 45:04.149
And none of this,
none of this,

45:04.184 --> 45:06.565
could've happened without you,
and you alone,

45:06.600 --> 45:08.498
spotting that van
outside the bookies

45:08.533 --> 45:11.363
and deciding for some reason
I cannot fathom

45:11.398 --> 45:13.918
that it warranted
investigation.

45:13.952 --> 45:17.784
Sir, all this
is circumstantial.

45:17.818 --> 45:20.372
There's no evidence to support
anyone "knowing"

45:20.407 --> 45:22.823
any details
of Operation Lighthouse.

45:22.858 --> 45:24.480
Evidence?

45:24.514 --> 45:26.378
We'll give you evidence.
DC Bishop.

45:28.311 --> 45:31.798
Image 41 shows
item reference AR-6.

45:31.832 --> 45:34.283
A knife that was detected
in the vicinity

45:34.317 --> 45:36.181
-of Carl Banks's body.
Yes, the killer,

45:36.216 --> 45:38.770
he didn't even bother to throw
the knife into the canal.

45:38.805 --> 45:40.323
I mean, he left it laying
around

45:40.358 --> 45:41.497
for the search team to find.

45:41.531 --> 45:43.326
That was handy, wasn't it.

45:43.361 --> 45:45.018
Criminals make mistakes.

45:45.052 --> 45:47.572
That's how we catch them.

45:47.606 --> 45:51.265
I could say exactly the same,
DCI Davidson,

45:51.300 --> 45:53.440
exactly the same.

45:53.474 --> 45:56.201
Please refer to
Document 23 in your folders,

45:56.236 --> 46:00.033
a copy of a forensic report
on item reference AR-6.

46:00.067 --> 46:03.519
"Blood detected on AR-6
was subjected to DNA analysis.

46:03.553 --> 46:06.039
"The DNA harvested
from blood cells on AR-6

46:06.073 --> 46:09.145
"match with 99.9 per cent
probability DNA

46:09.180 --> 46:11.044
"from Carl Banks.

46:11.078 --> 46:13.840
"Fingerprints on

"99.9 per cent
probability fingerprints

46:15.186 --> 46:16.463
"belonging to
Alastair Oldroyd."

46:16.497 --> 46:18.465
Alastair Oldroyd
was the CHIS who submitted

46:18.499 --> 46:20.156
the original intel
that Banks had confessed

46:20.191 --> 46:22.331
-to Vella's murder.
So,

46:22.365 --> 46:24.402
for some reason
Alastair Oldroyd,

46:24.436 --> 46:28.233
no history of violent crime,
kills Banks?

46:28.268 --> 46:30.097
The evidence proves
Oldroyd handled

46:30.132 --> 46:31.512
the murder weapon.

46:31.547 --> 46:34.308
We suspect Banks had been
threatening Oldroyd.

46:34.343 --> 46:35.585
Are you trying to kid us

46:35.620 --> 46:37.518
that Alastair Oldroyd
went in there,

46:37.553 --> 46:39.589
beat Banks unconscious
dragged him out of his flat?

46:39.624 --> 46:41.937
He was ten stone ringing wet!

46:43.283 --> 46:45.526
And that's not the half of it,

46:45.561 --> 46:47.977
not by a long chalk.
DI Arnott.

46:48.012 --> 46:49.530
Document 31.

46:49.565 --> 46:52.050
According to your files,
Oldroyd was found dead

46:52.085 --> 46:53.845
on the 29th of October
from a fall

46:53.880 --> 46:56.468
from the derelict
Chapel Place Car Park.

46:56.503 --> 46:58.574
According to said files,
due to the lack of witnesses

46:58.608 --> 47:01.404
and security cameras
it's impossible to determine

47:01.439 --> 47:03.924
if Oldroyd jumped
or he was pushed.

47:03.959 --> 47:06.651
Our hypothesis
is that Oldroyd killed Banks

47:06.685 --> 47:08.377
then committed suicide.

47:08.411 --> 47:10.310
Yeah, your hypothesis,

47:10.344 --> 47:11.690
so there we have it.

47:11.725 --> 47:15.177
A series
of suspicious deaths

47:15.211 --> 47:18.042
that conveniently obliterate
a trail of evidence

47:18.076 --> 47:20.113
that might lead us
to Gail Vella's

47:20.147 --> 47:22.184
actual murderer.
And in the meantime,

47:22.218 --> 47:24.289
you have that wee fella,
Terry Boyle,

47:24.324 --> 47:26.395
on police bail.

47:26.429 --> 47:30.157
You have failed to consider
the alternative.

47:30.192 --> 47:32.332
That Carl Banks
murdered Gail Vella

47:32.366 --> 47:34.955
on the orders
of organised crime,

47:34.990 --> 47:38.027
and organised criminals
murdered Carl Banks

47:38.062 --> 47:39.649
for his silence,

47:39.684 --> 47:43.239
and that organised criminals
framed Alastair Oldroyd

47:43.274 --> 47:46.656
for Banks's murder and then,
staged Oldroyd's murder

47:46.691 --> 47:48.348
to look like a suicide.

47:48.382 --> 47:50.591
Of course, I've considered
alternatives...

47:50.626 --> 47:52.283
And none of this,

47:52.317 --> 47:53.732
none of this
would have happened,

47:53.767 --> 47:56.252
without crucial information
on police activities

47:56.287 --> 47:59.255
being leaked
to organised crime.

48:05.330 --> 48:06.607
I agree.

48:11.992 --> 48:13.683
Excuse me?

48:13.718 --> 48:15.133
I agree, sir.

48:17.066 --> 48:18.550
If your theory's correct,

48:18.585 --> 48:19.931
the only way
it could've worked

48:19.966 --> 48:21.553
would've been
for a corrupt officer

48:21.588 --> 48:23.762
from my team to have
leaked key information

48:23.797 --> 48:25.385
to organised crime.

48:27.766 --> 48:30.666
Well, as I'm sure
you're aware of,

48:30.700 --> 48:32.702
DCI Davidson,
there's really only one way

48:32.737 --> 48:35.050
we're gonna find out.

48:35.084 --> 48:36.223
DCI Joanne Davidson,

48:36.258 --> 48:37.707
you do not have to say
anything,

48:37.742 --> 48:39.399
but it may harm your defence
if you do not mention

48:39.433 --> 48:41.780
when questioned something
you later rely on in court.

48:41.815 --> 48:44.128
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

48:44.162 --> 48:47.476
DCI Davidson,
did you leak information

48:47.510 --> 48:49.996
on your team's operations?

48:50.030 --> 48:51.790
No, sir, I did not.

48:51.825 --> 48:54.483
Do you know of anyone
who did leak information?

48:54.517 --> 48:57.417
No, sir, I do not.

48:57.451 --> 49:00.454
I'd ask if you've examined
my communications history?

49:00.489 --> 49:02.732
As per anticorruption powers,
we've been able to access

49:02.767 --> 49:04.251
your work calls and emails.

49:04.286 --> 49:06.081
Any evidence that
I've been communicating

49:06.115 --> 49:07.703
-with an OCG?
No, ma'am,

49:07.737 --> 49:09.532
however, we all recognise
that such communication

49:09.567 --> 49:11.362
is typically carried out
by unregistered

49:11.396 --> 49:12.639
so-called burner phones.

49:12.673 --> 49:14.537
I don't have a burner phone.

49:14.572 --> 49:15.987
Search my address.

49:16.022 --> 49:17.195
Search my car.

49:17.230 --> 49:19.059
We will, ma'am.

49:19.094 --> 49:20.405
Fine.

49:22.614 --> 49:24.306
Are we done, sir?

49:24.340 --> 49:26.653
No, DCI Davidson,
we are not done here.

49:26.687 --> 49:28.103
I am not happy
with some of your answers

49:28.137 --> 49:30.312
you've given
in this interview today.

49:30.346 --> 49:31.796
Specifically, I am concerned
about

49:31.830 --> 49:33.556
three unanswered questions,

49:33.591 --> 49:36.490
one, your possible collusion
in diverting

49:36.525 --> 49:38.803
and delaying
Carl Banks's arrest,

49:38.837 --> 49:42.427
two, your possible collusion
in the failure to maintain

49:42.462 --> 49:44.671
constant surveillance
on Carl Banks's flat,

49:44.705 --> 49:47.087
and three,
your possible collusion

49:47.122 --> 49:51.609
in leaking information
regarding items one and two,

49:51.643 --> 49:53.266
and so therefore,
DCI Davidson,

49:53.300 --> 49:54.853
I'm going to arrest you
on suspicion

49:54.888 --> 49:56.510
of Perverting
the Course of Justice.

49:56.545 --> 49:58.685
DCI Davidson strenuously
denies the allegations.

49:58.719 --> 50:00.273
You will be held here

50:00.307 --> 50:03.310
until we can find a suitable
police custody cell.

50:03.345 --> 50:07.142
Interview terminated
22.

50:08.384 --> 50:09.558
Wait.

50:12.526 --> 50:15.115
An OCG needed time
to plan the robbery

50:15.150 --> 50:16.841
and the abduction of Banks.

50:16.875 --> 50:18.429
If I was SIO on this,

50:18.463 --> 50:20.086
the first thing
I'd want to know is who knew

50:20.120 --> 50:22.571
about Banks's confession
early enough.

50:22.605 --> 50:25.263
In order,
that's the CHIS Handler,

50:25.298 --> 50:27.300
then my officers
who received his call,

50:27.334 --> 50:31.304
PS Jatri and DS Lomax,
then me, then my boss,

50:31.338 --> 50:33.409
Detective Superintendent
Buckells.

50:34.617 --> 50:36.343
If you're going to search
my home,

50:36.378 --> 50:38.552
I'd suggest
you search theirs too.

50:57.675 --> 50:59.884
Do you understand
how much work I've got to do?

50:59.918 --> 51:02.300
Right, when the Chief Super
phones up and asks

51:02.335 --> 51:03.819
what's going on
with Lighthouse, right,

51:03.853 --> 51:05.717
-what am I gonna tell him?
Cheers guys.

51:05.752 --> 51:07.616
Oh, about bloody time.

51:07.650 --> 51:09.307
You gonna tell me
what the hell's going on?

51:09.342 --> 51:10.722
Detective Superintendent Buckells,

51:10.757 --> 51:12.379
in connection
with our lawful inquiry

51:12.414 --> 51:14.450
into Operation Lighthouse,
we have received authority

51:14.485 --> 51:15.934
to examine
the communications activity

51:15.969 --> 51:17.591
of certain named officers.

51:17.626 --> 51:19.800
-Is this a piss-take or what?
Sir, your work

51:19.835 --> 51:21.354
and personal communications
records

51:21.388 --> 51:22.872
are currently
being scrutinised.

51:22.907 --> 51:24.598
Furthermore,
we have received authority

51:24.633 --> 51:26.255
to carry out a search
of your vehicle

51:26.290 --> 51:28.154
and your home
under warrant powers.

51:30.501 --> 51:32.434
This is a joke,

51:32.468 --> 51:34.091
a total pigging joke.

51:35.264 --> 51:36.748
Well, yeah,
I'll tell you what,

51:36.783 --> 51:38.543
when you find my stash
of jazz mags,

51:38.578 --> 51:40.511
feel free to knock one out.

51:40.545 --> 51:42.409
Thank you
for your cooperation, sir.

51:58.529 --> 51:59.737
DI Arnott.

51:59.771 --> 52:02.222
It's Chloe, sir.

52:02.257 --> 52:03.810
Look, I'm at the search
and the FIs have found

52:03.844 --> 52:05.191
a cache of burner phones.

52:05.225 --> 52:06.640
Where? Davidson's?

52:06.675 --> 52:08.401
No. Officer J.'s.

52:09.333 --> 52:10.472
At Farida's.

52:11.749 --> 52:12.922
On my way.

52:21.207 --> 52:23.347
For the DIR,
I am showing PS Jatri

52:23.381 --> 52:25.314
item reference CB-4.

52:25.349 --> 52:27.903
CB-4 is an unregistered
mobile phone detected

52:27.937 --> 52:31.872
during a lawful search
of 29 Stalton Drive.

52:31.907 --> 52:33.495
Do you recognise this phone?

52:33.529 --> 52:34.634
No!

52:36.670 --> 52:40.536
For the DIR, I am showing
PS Jatri Image 76.

52:40.571 --> 52:43.746
Image 76 shows a cache
of similar devices detected

52:43.781 --> 52:46.784
during said lawful search
of 29 Stalton Drive.

52:46.818 --> 52:48.579
How do you account
for these devices being found

52:48.613 --> 52:50.374
-hidden in your home?
-They've been put there!

52:50.408 --> 52:51.651
I don't know anything
about them!

52:51.685 --> 52:53.653
All these devices
bear DNA deposits

52:53.687 --> 52:55.241
matching your elimination samples.

52:55.275 --> 52:56.552
I've never
even seen them before

52:56.587 --> 52:57.933
let alone touched them!

52:57.967 --> 53:00.867
Examination of mobile phone CB-4

53:00.901 --> 53:02.938
reveals calls
made in the early hours

53:02.972 --> 53:06.976
of October 27th
to an unidentified number.

53:07.011 --> 53:09.634
The timing of these calls
coincides exactly

53:09.669 --> 53:11.257
with the first
intelligence report

53:11.291 --> 53:15.295
of a suspect claiming
to have murdered Gail Vella.

53:15.330 --> 53:17.332
Did you pass
on confidential information

53:17.366 --> 53:18.747
on the operation
to arrest this suspect?

53:18.781 --> 53:20.024
No! No!

53:20.058 --> 53:21.853
I had nothing to do with it!

53:24.097 --> 53:26.962
Farida Jatri,
I have been in consultation

53:26.996 --> 53:29.275
with the Crown Prosecutor
and she has authorised me

53:29.309 --> 53:31.000
to charge you
with the following offences...

53:31.035 --> 53:33.520
-I'm being framed!
-Who's framing you?

53:35.108 --> 53:37.593
Who are you claiming
is framing you?

53:40.665 --> 53:43.634
It's Jo. It's Jo Davidson.

53:43.668 --> 53:45.083
She planted those phones.

53:45.118 --> 53:47.224
You're claiming
she broke into your house?

53:48.811 --> 53:51.331
She didn't have to break in.

53:51.366 --> 53:52.608
What do you mean by that?

53:54.921 --> 53:56.716
She lived there with me.

53:58.752 --> 54:00.892
We searched
DCI Davidson's home address.

54:00.927 --> 54:02.549
-It appears lived in.
Yeah,

54:02.584 --> 54:03.930
she has her own place.
She just kept

54:03.964 --> 54:06.001
-overnight stuff at mine.
-We found no items

54:06.035 --> 54:07.761
belonging to another person.

54:07.796 --> 54:09.280
She moved out.

54:14.043 --> 54:16.356
Are you able
to disclose to us

54:16.391 --> 54:18.427
the nature
of this relationship?

54:25.710 --> 54:27.367
She was lying to me.

54:28.541 --> 54:31.371
She lied and lied.

54:31.406 --> 54:33.339
That's the kind
of person she is.

54:33.373 --> 54:34.754
None of you know
what she's like...

54:45.005 --> 54:47.353
God give me strength.
I don't know who to believe.

54:47.387 --> 54:48.699
Well, now it seems
possible Farida

54:48.733 --> 54:49.941
made allegations
about Davidson

54:49.976 --> 54:51.495
for personal reasons.

54:51.529 --> 54:52.772
But the stuff we've found
since then...

54:52.806 --> 54:54.463
Isn't enough.

54:54.498 --> 54:58.398
Not yet anyway.

54:58.433 --> 54:59.572
<i>Custody.</i>

54:59.606 --> 55:01.021
Superintendent Hastings.

55:01.056 --> 55:03.955
<i>Sir.
-Release DCI Davidson.</i>

55:03.990 --> 55:05.129
<i>Sir.</i>

55:11.031 --> 55:13.137
FARIDA Why won't anyone
believe me?

55:29.049 --> 55:31.051
Thanks,
I'm fine from here.

55:31.086 --> 55:32.467
Ma'am.

55:48.586 --> 55:50.519
Where to, ma'am?

55:50.554 --> 55:52.418
I need to pick up my car.

55:53.798 --> 55:54.937
I don't know
if they've told you

55:54.972 --> 55:56.767
about PS Jatri...

55:56.801 --> 55:58.941
That's what happens to a rat.
