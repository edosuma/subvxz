A SERIES BASED ON THE BOOK "ANNA"
WRITTEN BY NICCOLÃ’ AMMANITI IN 2015

00:19.440 --> 00:22.280
THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
HIT 6 MONTHS AFTER FILMING BEGAN

00:24.120 --> 00:27.360
WHAT TO DO WHEN MAMA DIES

00:27.760 --> 00:29.520
Astor!

00:31.440 --> 00:32.800
Wake up.

00:37.520 --> 00:39.000
Who are you?

00:42.160 --> 00:43.400
It's Mama.

00:46.520 --> 00:48.680
You're my mama?

00:48.880 --> 00:51.720
- How are you, Astor?
- Good, Mama.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.600
This is 'Ndraveche.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.400
And Anna? Where's your sister?

00:59.280 --> 01:00.760
I don't know.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.200
They cut off her arm.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.040
Don't you think about Anna?

01:07.240 --> 01:09.120
No, I don't think about her.

01:09.760 --> 01:11.160
How come?

01:11.960 --> 01:13.880
I've forgotten everything.

01:15.440 --> 01:17.240
You know what mothers are for?

01:18.400 --> 01:21.880
To remind us
of the important things in our hearts.

01:22.880 --> 01:25.640
Go home, go to your sister.

01:26.840 --> 01:29.480
Mama, can I cut your strings?

01:30.200 --> 01:31.840
So you can come with me.

01:32.200 --> 01:34.720
No, or I'll fall down.

01:43.960 --> 01:45.920
'Ndraveche, wake up.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.640
- What is it?
- I have to go, bye.

01:54.760 --> 01:56.520
Merry Christmas.

04:31.640 --> 04:35.320
You can wake up, now, princess,
I kissed you.

04:49.200 --> 04:50.360
Stop it.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.480
Astor, listen to me.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.280
You and I have to leave,

05:04.080 --> 05:05.840
we have to go away.

05:07.880 --> 05:09.960
When I was on the volcano

05:10.840 --> 05:12.840
I saw the mainland.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.640
I woke up and I saw it.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.880
Italy is close.

05:20.280 --> 05:21.680
Where?

05:24.680 --> 05:26.320
Beyond the sea.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.720
Let's go, so we can see what's there.

05:29.920 --> 05:31.200
Why?

05:33.440 --> 05:35.640
Because I'm growing up

05:37.320 --> 05:41.120
and we'll see if there are
Grown-ups with medicine.

05:42.880 --> 05:45.120
But the Grown-ups are all dead.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.560
The Little Lady was alive, though,

05:50.760 --> 05:53.480
there might be others like her.

05:55.560 --> 05:58.960
'Ndraveche told me
if you take a bath with a chicken

05:59.160 --> 06:02.720
and you hold it underwater for a minute,
you'll live forever.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.840
Unfortunately, it's not true.

06:08.320 --> 06:10.280
Do you want to go?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.480
Let's go.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.440
Can I put her in too?

06:34.920 --> 06:35.920
Why?

06:36.360 --> 06:38.320
So they can be together.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.640
Sure.

07:41.920 --> 07:43.960
Stop chewing your hair.

08:49.640 --> 08:51.120
I'm hungry.

08:51.840 --> 08:54.080
Sleep, that way you won't be hungry.

08:56.200 --> 08:59.520
- Why don't we go home?
- Don't start.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.520
Was Mama blonde?

09:07.000 --> 09:09.560
No, you've seen the photos.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.160
Was she beautiful?

09:13.080 --> 09:14.400
Yes.

09:15.400 --> 09:18.280
Yes, very, all the men chased after her.

09:20.400 --> 09:21.840
Like dogs.

09:22.640 --> 09:23.920
Yes.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.760
Was Papa a dog?

09:30.840 --> 09:32.520
Yeah, a little bit.

09:58.360 --> 09:59.640
Anna.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.880
Do you have the Red Fever?

10:05.680 --> 10:08.040
- You're not going to die?
- No.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.480
- Come down!
- No.

10:45.560 --> 10:46.800
Come down!

11:00.200 --> 11:01.480
Little brat.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.680
OMG, these are amazing!

12:18.880 --> 12:20.320
Anna, look.

12:21.320 --> 12:22.920
Chocolate!

12:23.360 --> 12:24.720
Keep looking.

12:38.840 --> 12:40.520
What do you want?

12:41.080 --> 12:42.560
Anna, run!

13:19.240 --> 13:21.920
Move it, I'm always waiting for you.

13:25.280 --> 13:26.960
Don't make me mad.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.240
Enough, I'm tired.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.920
I want to stay here, it's nice here.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.880
Anyway, where are we going?

13:36.080 --> 13:38.400
To Italy, I told you a hundred times.

13:38.600 --> 13:41.160
I don't care about Italy!

13:43.200 --> 13:44.640
- Let's go.
- No.

13:45.320 --> 13:49.120
- Don't piss me off.
- You go, I'm staying here.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.560
All right.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.560
Bye, Astor.

14:19.280 --> 14:21.320
Come and see, run!

14:41.120 --> 14:42.080
Italy!

15:04.800 --> 15:06.760
Look how big it is!

15:07.600 --> 15:09.440
And what a long nose!

16:02.640 --> 16:05.840
"Me-ro-tti-na".

16:06.920 --> 16:08.960
Here, this is a good one.

16:09.080 --> 16:10.360
No, it's not right.

16:37.440 --> 16:39.400
Here, this is perfect!

16:41.200 --> 16:43.160
You use your feet like on a bicycle.

16:43.240 --> 16:46.960
- It's a boat, not a bicycle.
- No, it's a paddle boat.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.480
We've got to get it in the water.

16:55.840 --> 16:59.120
You're really strong.

16:59.680 --> 17:01.920
One, two, three!

17:02.800 --> 17:03.960
Pull!

17:17.360 --> 17:18.840
Pull!

17:36.360 --> 17:39.480
Let's sleep now,
we'll keep going tomorrow.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.520
Turn the light off.

17:47.880 --> 17:50.880
<i>The plague which in these times</i>

17:51.200 --> 17:54.000
<i>smites us all</i>

17:55.200 --> 17:58.560
<i>and for which there appears
to be no cure yet...</i>

18:00.200 --> 18:02.120
Stop it! What's wrong?

18:10.800 --> 18:12.240
You want this?

18:12.440 --> 18:15.520
<i>Harm suffered
for harm that has been inflicted.</i>

18:16.520 --> 18:20.800
<i>There's a sweet rigor for Augustine...</i>

18:21.720 --> 18:23.320
Are you hungry?

18:31.840 --> 18:33.400
I'm sick of you!

18:39.640 --> 18:41.600
Don't close the door.

18:44.240 --> 18:46.880
It's dangerous to stay with them.

18:56.600 --> 18:58.200
<i>Humanity...</i>

19:06.360 --> 19:08.160
We have to be careful.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.600
Don't drag him.

19:21.840 --> 19:25.080
Let him go,
let him go and play.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.320
- He's always crying.
- I know.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.080
Promise me you'll look after him,

19:41.280 --> 19:43.280
he's little and you have to be patient.

19:43.680 --> 19:45.200
He's your son, not mine!

19:45.640 --> 19:48.240
He's your brother,
you have to protect him.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.560
Promise me.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.560
I promise.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.680
- Again.
- I promise.

20:04.720 --> 20:06.880
- Louder.
- I promise.

20:07.080 --> 20:09.040
- Swear you will.
- I swear.

20:09.120 --> 20:12.840
You won't do it,
you're selfish like your father.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.640
Yes, I will. I swear, Mama.

20:20.000 --> 20:22.400
I've written everything
in this notebook, got it?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.200
Look after it

20:27.040 --> 20:29.440
and teach Astor to read.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.840
Don't forget.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.800
Anna, it's morning.

21:17.960 --> 21:20.000
Not too much, we need it.

21:50.320 --> 21:52.400
One, two...

23:11.560 --> 23:13.000
Mama.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.600
Say goodbye to Sicily.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.600
Bye, Sicily.

23:45.600 --> 23:47.360
- Ready?
- Ready.

24:25.640 --> 24:28.640
"Things to do when Mama dies."

24:32.000 --> 24:35.120
<i>"When I die I'll be too heavy
for you to carry me out.</i>

24:37.840 --> 24:41.320
<i>Anna, open the windows,
take everything you need</i>

24:41.520 --> 24:43.560
<i>and lock the door.</i>

24:56.920 --> 24:59.960
<i>If it stinks too much in the house,
sleep in the car.</i>

25:05.120 --> 25:07.240
<i>You have to wait 100 days.</i>

25:08.320 --> 25:11.520
<i>On the sheet next to this
I've drawn 100 lines.</i>

25:14.560 --> 25:17.160
<i>Cross one out every morning.</i>

25:20.080 --> 25:23.600
<i>The days may seem a lot,
but time passes quickly."</i>

25:46.640 --> 25:49.000
Pedal, I can't do it by myself.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.040
Enough, I'm tired.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.760
- Come on, pedal.
- I don't want to.

25:56.840 --> 25:58.520
If you don't pedal we'll die.

25:59.360 --> 26:02.440
- Can't you see we're moving away?
- Let's go back.

26:03.120 --> 26:05.760
Pedal, or we'll be stuck out at sea!

26:12.760 --> 26:14.760
Shall we sing a song?

26:19.480 --> 26:20.600
Come on.

26:38.120 --> 26:39.440
Come on, sing.

27:34.440 --> 27:37.600
<i>"Only when all the lines
are crossed out,</i>

27:37.680 --> 27:39.480
<i>can you open the door to my room.</i>

27:41.480 --> 27:43.960
<i>Go into the house
only to get what you need</i>

27:44.160 --> 27:45.840
<i>and don't waste food."</i>

27:49.880 --> 27:51.080
Anna.

27:59.680 --> 28:01.080
Open the door!

28:08.000 --> 28:11.080
Open the door, please, I don't feel good,

28:12.000 --> 28:13.560
I'm thirsty.

28:16.760 --> 28:18.520
Little Anna, come.

28:20.320 --> 28:23.160
Help me, darling, I'm suffering so much.

28:40.480 --> 28:43.600
Here I am, Mama, I'm behind here,

28:44.240 --> 28:47.680
I'll come in, look,
and if you're dead, I'll go straight out.

29:30.840 --> 29:32.120
You want a puppy?

29:32.480 --> 29:36.200
If you do, you have
to come here and poop.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.360
You push...

29:39.800 --> 29:41.400
and you poop, got it?

29:49.880 --> 29:51.280
Poop.

29:51.480 --> 29:53.240
Do it, go on.

30:03.120 --> 30:05.360
Do what I'm doing, come.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.120
Look at the rain.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.000
See it?

30:24.680 --> 30:25.720
The cushion.

30:25.920 --> 30:28.880
No, don't draw on the cushion.

30:29.080 --> 30:30.680
- Here?
- Yeah.

30:57.640 --> 30:59.520
- Did you hurt yourself?
- Yes.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.440
Show me your hands.

31:02.800 --> 31:04.560
Look up there.

31:17.680 --> 31:19.520
Go away, filthy birds!

31:36.560 --> 31:37.800
Go away.

31:39.560 --> 31:41.440
Go away, filthy birds!

31:41.720 --> 31:42.960
Go away...

35:14.320 --> 35:15.800
Pietro.

35:50.440 --> 35:52.160
Anna...

36:55.400 --> 36:56.680
The book.

36:57.160 --> 37:00.120
It fell in the water, it's my fault.

37:00.480 --> 37:01.920
I'm sorry.

37:03.040 --> 37:05.360
We'll write another one.

37:16.960 --> 37:19.720
<i>93, 94,</i>

37:20.520 --> 37:23.800
95, 96, 97,

98, 99, 100!

37:52.160 --> 37:55.840
<i>"When 100 days have passed,
come back into my room.</i>

37:57.320 --> 37:59.320
<i>Don't look at my face.</i>

38:05.800 --> 38:09.560
<i>Tie me to a rope,
it's in the third drawer in the desk,</i>

38:09.760 --> 38:11.560
<i>and drag me outside.</i>

38:18.920 --> 38:21.560
<i>It will be easy because
I won't weigh much.</i>

39:21.840 --> 39:24.480
<i>Take me into the woods,
to a place you like</i>

39:24.560 --> 39:25.680
<i>and cover me with stones.</i>

39:31.720 --> 39:34.040
<i>Clean my room with bleach,</i>

39:35.840 --> 39:38.080
<i>then you can live inside again."</i>

40:08.000 --> 40:10.120
Shoo! Go away!

40:43.760 --> 40:45.720
What are you doing?

40:53.600 --> 40:55.320
The hair.

44:51.400 --> 44:52.720
Water.

45:14.800 --> 45:16.240
Press the switch.

45:24.480 --> 45:25.800
The light.

45:26.320 --> 45:27.880
There's electricity!

45:35.520 --> 45:38.240
Artichokes in oil!

45:43.160 --> 45:44.960
Chocolate hazelnut spread!

45:56.960 --> 45:59.120
- How is it?
- Delicious.

47:22.560 --> 47:25.680
<i>"What distinguishes human beings
from all other animals</i>

47:25.880 --> 47:29.080
<i>is the ability to imagine
and tell stories,</i>

47:30.080 --> 47:33.520
<i>because it's only through stories
that nothing ever really dies.</i>

47:33.720 --> 47:36.080
<i>Unbelievable things can happen,</i>

47:36.280 --> 47:39.080
<i>the chaos of the world

<i>And what seemed the end of everything,</i>

<i>may turn out to be
an extraordinary, new beginning."</i>
