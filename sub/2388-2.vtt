00:01.293 --> 00:03.378
<i>Kids, the summer of 2012</i>

00:03.462 --> 00:05.047
<i>was the Summer of Love.</i>

00:05.047 --> 00:06.924
<i>Barney and Quinn,</i>

00:06.924 --> 00:08.800
<i>me and Victoria,</i>

00:08.884 --> 00:11.929
<i>Robin and Nick,</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.389
<i>Lily, Marshall and Marvin.</i>

00:14.473 --> 00:16.850
<i>Everyone was happy as can be.</i>

00:18.936 --> 00:20.854
<i>Which means there are
absolutely no good stories.</i>

00:20.938 --> 00:23.815
<i>Let's skip ahead...</i>

00:23.899 --> 00:26.068
<i>to October 2012,</i>

00:26.068 --> 00:28.737
<i>the official kick-off
of what came to be known as</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:31.198
<i>the Autumn of Breakups.</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:33.367
<i>It all started when Barney
got a little friendly advice</i>

00:33.367 --> 00:34.910
<i>from a coworker.</i>

00:34.910 --> 00:37.120
Get a prenup, or I'll neuter you

00:37.204 --> 00:38.497
before she ever has a chance!

00:38.497 --> 00:41.208
First of all,
if you have an onion bagel,

00:41.208 --> 00:44.002
you don't need
scallion cream cheese.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.215
Secondly, Quinn is a great girl.

00:48.215 --> 00:49.550
I trust her.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.134
Oh, Darlene was a great girl.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.719
I trusted her.

00:52.803 --> 00:53.929
And then she took everything!

00:53.929 --> 00:55.973
My house, my car...

00:55.973 --> 00:59.184
my dog Tugboat.

00:59.268 --> 01:01.144
I even lost out with the kids.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.813
Full custody!

01:02.813 --> 01:05.566
I got full custody of those kids!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.150
Your kids are horrible.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.070
The worst.
Barney, I watched as Darlene

01:10.070 --> 01:11.738
cut everything good out of my life

01:11.822 --> 01:14.700
like a deranged surgeon
hacking out organs,

01:14.700 --> 01:16.910
and that's not a metaphor.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.162
She got one of my kidneys.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.250
That's her ringtone.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.170
I have nothing left
to give you, Darlene!

01:42.519 --> 01:44.313
You won't believe
what Barney did today.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.899
You won't believe
what Quinn did today.

01:46.899 --> 01:49.985
- Hey, you ready for lunch?
- Hey, there she is.

01:49.985 --> 01:53.030
The future Mrs. Barney Stinson.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.907
You better enjoy signing
your name "Quinn Garvey"

01:54.907 --> 01:56.783
while you still can, right?

01:56.867 --> 01:58.994
Like, I don't know...

01:58.994 --> 02:02.581
here, here, here,
initial here...

02:02.581 --> 02:06.335
- What is this?
- Oh, this is our prenup.

02:06.335 --> 02:09.087
Black or blue?
Totally up to you.

02:09.171 --> 02:10.672
Um, can I read it first?

02:10.756 --> 02:13.842
Can you believe that?
He wants me to sign a prenup!

02:13.926 --> 02:18.096
Can you believe that?
She wants to read it first!

02:18.180 --> 02:19.473
Just go ahead and sign.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.975
It's all pretty standard.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.185
"In the event of divorce,

02:23.185 --> 02:25.812
Mr. Stinson is granted
weekly visitation rights

02:25.896 --> 02:29.024
to Ann, Sarah and Molly."

02:29.024 --> 02:31.193
You named our future kids?

02:31.193 --> 02:32.819
That's actually pretty sweet.

02:32.903 --> 02:37.074
Those are Mr. Stinson's names
for your lady parts.

02:37.074 --> 02:38.742
It's important for the girls to maintain

02:38.742 --> 02:41.328
a relationship with their daddy.

02:42.496 --> 02:45.374
You named her lady parts?

02:45.374 --> 02:47.292
Everyone does that.

02:47.376 --> 02:49.586
So... Lily?

02:49.670 --> 02:51.129
Snap, Crackle, Pop.

02:52.381 --> 02:55.133
- Solid.
- Wait.

02:55.217 --> 02:57.636
Is this prenup in any way legit?

02:57.636 --> 02:59.096
I mean, so far,
it sounds a lot like

02:59.096 --> 03:01.682
that bar napkin document you
make one-night stands sign,

03:01.682 --> 03:03.267
promising not to get clingy.

03:03.267 --> 03:05.227
The Pre-Shtup, patent pending.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.604
God, I come up with
a lot of good stuff!

03:07.688 --> 03:11.733
Anyway, I realize these aren't just terms
for divorce, so I ask...

03:11.817 --> 03:15.112
Are these rules for how I have
to behave in our marriage?

03:15.112 --> 03:17.155
Rules?

03:17.239 --> 03:19.324
Suggestions.

03:19.408 --> 03:21.326
Rich people and celebrities
put stuff like this

03:21.410 --> 03:22.494
in their prenups all the time.

03:22.578 --> 03:25.247
And those are
the marriages that last.

03:26.582 --> 03:30.419
I have to pay $2,000
every time I gain a pound?

03:30.419 --> 03:32.713
Not every time.

03:32.713 --> 03:36.133
Just if it shows up
at the weekly weigh-in.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.384
See, you can't do that.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.971
"Miss Garvey must invent
12 new sexual positions per year,

03:40.971 --> 03:44.850
"at least ten of which involve her
doing all or most of the work."

03:44.850 --> 03:46.935
- You definitely can't do that.
- Hm-mm.

03:47.019 --> 03:50.272
"Miss Garvey's breasts
must be enhanced every five years

03:50.272 --> 03:54.318
or 50,000 honka-honkas,
whichever comes first."

03:54.318 --> 03:57.321
- That's actually not bad.
- I'll allow it.

03:57.321 --> 03:58.780
That's repulsive.

03:58.864 --> 04:02.409
And, sidebar: why do men think
women like to be honka-honka'd?

04:02.409 --> 04:05.495
What woman wants her breasts
squeezed like a seal horn?

04:05.579 --> 04:08.040
Um... totally.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.460
Lily like-a-like-a
the honka-honka.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.048
"All hair below the neck
must be removed weekly."

04:16.048 --> 04:18.842
Hey, you're gonna be thanking me
for that hair loss

04:18.926 --> 04:20.761
during the weigh-in.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.723
"Miss Garvey's parents may stay
at our place as long as they like."

04:24.723 --> 04:27.226
Well, at least that one's nice.

04:28.894 --> 04:32.773
"Provided they
each arrive in an urn."

04:32.773 --> 04:35.859
"Wives two through eight
will make a weekly chore wheel."

04:35.943 --> 04:38.070
I'm sorry, I borrowed
a few sections

04:38.070 --> 04:40.656
from a prenup I did
for a Saudi Arabian sultan.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.950
I'll cross out
the extra wives stuff.

04:42.950 --> 04:46.245
- Unless...
- Cross it out.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.205
My God! What the hell
does Barney think

04:48.205 --> 04:50.374
marriage is going
to be like, anyway?

04:50.374 --> 04:53.001
Just a healthy,
modern-day marriage,

04:53.085 --> 04:56.171
based on mutual respect
between two equals.

04:56.255 --> 04:59.716
Ready for your wake-up
lap dance, Master?

04:59.800 --> 05:00.968
Aren't you forgetting
something?

05:00.968 --> 05:03.679
Oh, my God, it's 9:00 A.M.

05:03.679 --> 05:07.975
Legally mandated morning
pillow fight time!

05:11.270 --> 05:15.107
Best husband ever.
Best husband ever.

05:15.107 --> 05:17.276
Best husband ever. Aw.

05:17.276 --> 05:18.819
Best husband e...

05:18.819 --> 05:21.029
Sorry, sorry,
we crossed out the wives

05:21.113 --> 05:23.156
two through eight stuff. Unless...

05:23.240 --> 05:24.825
- Nope.
- Okay.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.785
Don't worry.
I crossed it out.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.704
I didn't really cross it out.

05:28.704 --> 05:31.623
I can hear you.
I'll cross it out.

05:33.125 --> 05:34.793
I didn't really cross it out.

05:34.877 --> 05:37.004
Hey, hey...

05:37.004 --> 05:38.714
Hey, guys, what's up?

05:38.714 --> 05:41.925
Oh, Quinn's pissed because Barney
wants her to sign a crazy prenup.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.719
But is it really crazy?

05:43.719 --> 05:45.429
- Yes.
- Well, I'm new to this but guessing yes.

05:45.429 --> 05:46.638
Yes.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.015
Okay, look.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.935
Did I go a speck of sand,
a fairy eyelash,

05:52.019 --> 05:54.062
a unicorn whisper too far?

05:54.146 --> 05:56.106
Perhaps.

05:56.190 --> 05:58.567
But can you tell me there's nothing

05:58.567 --> 06:01.320
in any of your relationships
you'd want to change?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.572
No behavior you'd
want to outlaw?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.741
No terms you'd
want to renegotiate?

06:05.741 --> 06:08.911
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm crazy.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.537
You're crazy.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.041
<i>But a funny thing
happened that night.</i>

06:16.001 --> 06:17.544
Look, I'm not saying he's right,

06:17.628 --> 06:20.339
but Barney does have
a little bit of a point.

06:20.339 --> 06:22.674
But on this one,
he may have a point. I mean, look...

06:22.758 --> 06:25.969
the idea of renegotiating
the terms of the relationship,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.846
that's valid.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.182
No.
There isn't anything about you

06:30.182 --> 06:32.726
that I'd want to change.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.771
Well, okay,
maybe a couple of things.

06:35.771 --> 06:37.731
Like what?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.816
<i>And just like that...</i>

06:39.900 --> 06:44.029
<i>one of these four couples
would break up the very next day.</i>

06:46.198 --> 06:48.534
<i>Okay, it wasn't Lily
and Marshall.</i>

06:48.534 --> 06:50.827
<i>One of these three couples
would break up</i>

06:50.911 --> 06:52.996
<i>the very next day.</i>

06:57.793 --> 06:59.211
What happened?

06:59.211 --> 07:02.256
So last night Nick was all like,
"Barney has a point

07:02.256 --> 07:05.801
about renegotiating the terms of the
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

07:05.801 --> 07:08.929
Yeah, and Marshall was all like,
"Uh, I want to blah, of the blah,

07:08.929 --> 07:10.848
uh, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."

07:10.848 --> 07:13.392
If I shut my eyes
it's like they're here.

07:13.392 --> 07:17.104
They're just using Barney's prenup
as a way to complain about us.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.648
I'm just saying,
you've forbidden certain things

07:19.648 --> 07:21.441
that I might like to revisit.

07:21.525 --> 07:24.778
Marshall, you're not going
on a Sasquatch hunt

07:24.862 --> 07:26.738
in Oregon with a bunch of loonies.

07:26.822 --> 07:28.448
Loonies?

07:28.532 --> 07:32.327
Those brave, bearded men
and women are crypto-zoologists,

07:32.411 --> 07:35.998
and they deserve
the respect that title commands.

07:35.998 --> 07:38.000
But that's not what
I was thinking of.

07:40.043 --> 07:42.004
You're too precious
with the baby.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.882
Okay, when we first came home
with Marvin,

07:44.882 --> 07:46.967
there was a bad moment.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.844
Welcome home, buddy.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.809
Was it really that high?

07:55.893 --> 07:57.978
I don't know.
I was hormonal.

07:57.978 --> 08:02.274
And suddenly, this primal,
protective mother voice came out of me.

08:02.274 --> 08:04.860
Actually, it was two voices.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.655
I seriously think one
was coming from my vagina.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.741
(DEEP,
Never do that again!

08:10.741 --> 08:14.328
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What is the big deal?

08:14.328 --> 08:16.538
My brothers and my dad
used to roughhouse with me

08:16.622 --> 08:17.873
all the time.

08:17.873 --> 08:21.627
Welcome home, Marshall.

08:21.627 --> 08:23.170
Hi.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.130
Boys go long.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.677
Stop!
Not in the house.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.638
That's how lamps break.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.265
Now go pass
that baby around outside.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.645
Oh, fumble!

08:39.645 --> 08:42.147
And I turned out
perfectly fine.

08:42.231 --> 08:44.358
Marshall, this morning
you thought a ghost

08:44.358 --> 08:46.401
made your toast.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.153
I didn't put the bread in.

08:48.237 --> 08:50.697
You didn't put the bread in.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.908
You know what?
I will play with my son

08:52.908 --> 08:55.160
however I see fit.
And you know what else?

08:55.244 --> 08:58.872
You can honka-honka
yourself tonight.

08:59.998 --> 09:02.543
Barney's prenup
ruined my night, too.

09:02.543 --> 09:06.713
Okay, uh, what behavior
of mine don't you like?

09:06.797 --> 09:09.132
I'm talking about the TV thing.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.635
Okay, the TV thing
is an argument

09:11.635 --> 09:13.887
from, like, three weeks ago.

09:13.971 --> 09:16.306
Mmm.

09:20.561 --> 09:21.812
Uh...

09:21.812 --> 09:23.355
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:23.355 --> 09:26.900
Didn't realize it takes 42 inches
to keep you satisfied.

09:26.984 --> 09:28.443
The TV happened to be on.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.653
I happened to glance at it.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.738
- Does that make me so weird?
- No.

09:31.822 --> 09:33.991
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

09:36.368 --> 09:38.620
I may be a little weird.

09:38.704 --> 09:42.958
Mmm.

09:42.958 --> 09:44.960
Oh, yeah.

09:44.960 --> 09:48.172
I get turned on
watching myself

09:48.172 --> 09:50.340
do the news during sex.

09:52.009 --> 09:53.468
Yeah, that's a little weird.

09:53.552 --> 09:57.890
Look, seeing myself on TV
makes me feel confident and sexy.

09:57.890 --> 10:01.059
And that is nothing to be
ashamed of, right, sisters?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.062
- Never speak of this.
- Ever.

10:04.146 --> 10:07.191
Yeah, of course. Yeah.

10:07.191 --> 10:09.026
There's more.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.740
Wait.

10:14.740 --> 10:17.576
So when you're doing the news
live at 7:00,

10:17.576 --> 10:19.119
you wink to future you

10:19.203 --> 10:21.371
watching the rebroadcast at 11:00?

10:23.373 --> 10:25.584
Maybe.

10:25.584 --> 10:28.337
- Never speak of this.
- Ever!

10:28.337 --> 10:31.548
You won't believe
what Ted did last night.

10:31.632 --> 10:34.009
You said you were happy
to help him out.

10:34.009 --> 10:35.802
Well, now
I'm changing my mind.

10:35.886 --> 10:38.305
Sorry to interrupt, roomie,
but I am trying to make sausage.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.849
Where do you keep
your pig intestines?

10:40.933 --> 10:43.185
What's your ex-fiancé
doing at Ted's?

10:43.185 --> 10:46.605
Klaus came to me
a few weeks ago.

10:46.605 --> 10:47.773
Since we broke up,

10:47.773 --> 10:50.192
he lost his job,
he got evicted.

10:50.192 --> 10:51.527
He's miserable.

10:51.527 --> 10:53.362
I'm so sorry.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.531
If I could just take
a quick whore's bath

10:55.531 --> 10:57.866
in your kitchen sink,
then I will skedaddle.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.452
Oh, Klaus, I wish that
there was something

11:00.536 --> 11:03.830
I could do to help.
There is, little lady.

11:03.914 --> 11:05.123
I've got a guest room.

11:05.207 --> 11:07.751
You'll stay here
till you're back on your feet.

11:07.835 --> 11:09.503
Are you sure?

11:09.503 --> 11:12.673
This is your apartment. Shh.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.508
Think of this as our apartment.

11:14.508 --> 11:16.468
Oh...
Hero Ted.

11:16.552 --> 11:18.929
- He loves that move.
- Yeah, for about five minutes,

11:18.929 --> 11:20.889
then he gets hero's remorse.

11:20.973 --> 11:22.891
Danke schon, roomie.

11:22.975 --> 11:24.351
I will go get my things.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.728
Das is super-duper-duper.

11:26.812 --> 11:28.480
My ferrets will be so happy.

11:28.564 --> 11:31.650
They have been living
in an airport locker for weeks.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.861
Here comes papa, children.

11:33.861 --> 11:36.905
I'll admit, there have been
a few awkward moments.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.866
You are going to love this.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.535
This is the popular
German situational-comedy,

11:41.535 --> 11:44.204
Strange Compatriots.

11:44.288 --> 11:45.831
Here we come.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.792
Ooh. Here's the thing
about this show, okay?

11:48.876 --> 11:51.211
One of them is very neat

11:51.295 --> 11:55.007
und the other one
is very, very neat.

11:55.007 --> 11:58.594
Oh, Fritz, kommen sie hier.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.637
Ah, Fritz...

12:00.721 --> 12:02.890
It's time to give Klaus
"das boot."

12:06.185 --> 12:07.603
Klaus?

12:07.603 --> 12:10.480
Wait, can-can you hear us
through the wall?

12:10.564 --> 12:12.482
Yes, I can hear you.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.777
I hear everything.

12:15.861 --> 12:19.364
That's it.
Klaus, get in here!

12:19.448 --> 12:21.283
For God's sake.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.410
I want you out
of my apartment.

12:23.410 --> 12:27.873
You, those ferrets
and all five newborns.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.541
Six and counting.

12:29.625 --> 12:33.086
Mama is still going.
It is like a clown car.

12:33.170 --> 12:35.923
Suddenly, it wasn't
our apartment anymore.

12:35.923 --> 12:37.799
I had no say
in the matter.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.551
These guys are unbelievable.

12:39.635 --> 12:41.803
You know what,
I am gonna go home

12:41.887 --> 12:45.432
and watch the news
all by myself.

12:45.516 --> 12:46.683
Wait.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.268
I have an idea.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.605
You know what?

12:51.605 --> 12:54.024
I'm on board
with the whole prenup thing.

12:54.024 --> 12:57.194
That's great.
It's here to protect you, too, sweetie.

12:57.194 --> 13:00.364
From becoming unappealing to me.

13:00.364 --> 13:04.743
Actually, I made my own prenup
with a little help.

13:04.743 --> 13:05.953
Ladies?

13:11.834 --> 13:15.671
Go ahead and sign.
It's all pretty standard.

13:15.671 --> 13:18.131
This might not be
the best time to ask,

13:18.215 --> 13:20.008
I'm sort of getting back
in the game.

13:20.092 --> 13:21.593
The redhead with the baby,

13:21.677 --> 13:23.971
what's her situation?

13:29.226 --> 13:31.687
"In the event of divorce,
Miss Garvey shall get

13:31.687 --> 13:35.190
full custody
of Mr. Stinson's suits"?

13:35.274 --> 13:36.525
Why?

13:36.525 --> 13:38.026
What would you do with them?

13:38.110 --> 13:41.530
Nothing. I'd just sit around
and watch them go out of style.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.824
That is just sick.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.284
Keep reading.

13:45.284 --> 13:47.661
"Mr. Stinson
is allowed to attend

13:47.661 --> 13:50.122
any function
at the Playboy Mansion."

13:50.122 --> 13:52.916
Well, at least that's nice.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.627
"Provided he arrives
in an urn."

13:58.630 --> 14:00.382
Gentlemen, just in time.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.884
What are you bitches doing here?

14:01.884 --> 14:03.552
- Lily.
- Oh, he's napping.

14:03.552 --> 14:05.345
It's the only time
I get to go blue.

14:05.429 --> 14:08.182
Barney texted us that you
guys were ganging up on him.

14:08.182 --> 14:10.350
So we're just here to ensure

14:10.434 --> 14:12.519
he doesn't sign anything
he'll regret.

14:12.603 --> 14:14.146
I'm sorry,
I don't think anyone here

14:14.146 --> 14:15.814
other than me is a lawyer.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.984
A well-paid,
successful lawyer.

14:20.319 --> 14:21.987
I-I'm a lawyer.

14:21.987 --> 14:23.822
Actually, we worked together
for years.

14:23.906 --> 14:26.783
Back off, stretch,
I saw her first.

14:26.867 --> 14:28.160
Hang on a second.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.995
"A half million dollar fine

14:29.995 --> 14:33.749
any time Mr. Stinson
can't 'rise to the occasion,

14:33.749 --> 14:36.752
cue sad slide whistle sounds"?

14:39.213 --> 14:41.298
Hey, what's this
about a shock collar?

14:41.298 --> 14:43.467
Ah, yes, we'll explain.

14:43.467 --> 14:45.761
Miss Garvey has
many attractive friends

14:45.761 --> 14:48.222
who will come to visit.

14:48.222 --> 14:51.183
May I offer you some goat cheese puff
pastries I made, mistress?

14:51.183 --> 14:54.478
As long as you can
do it quietly.

15:01.777 --> 15:02.945
<i>Wait, I'm confused.</i>

15:02.945 --> 15:05.781
If it's not around my neck,
then where's the shock collar?

15:07.616 --> 15:09.451
Oh, God.

15:09.535 --> 15:12.204
Oh, God.

15:12.204 --> 15:14.414
It's more of a shock ring, really.

15:14.498 --> 15:15.582
Her idea.

15:15.666 --> 15:19.378
Little missy
is packing a brain, too.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.629
Okay, you know what?

15:20.629 --> 15:24.341
Since we're all pitching in,
may I suggest a provision?

15:24.341 --> 15:27.094
In the event that you have a son,

15:27.094 --> 15:31.014
Mr. Stinson is free to play
with his child however he sees fit.

15:31.098 --> 15:33.225
How about forbidding
your future husband

15:33.225 --> 15:36.186
from spiking his child
into his crib?

15:36.270 --> 15:38.355
How about a clause protecting you
from having to engage

15:38.355 --> 15:41.316
in a three-way with her
and whatever's on basic cable?

15:41.400 --> 15:44.027
Oh, yeah?
How about forbidding...

15:45.571 --> 15:46.905
I got nothing.

15:46.989 --> 15:49.741
How about a provision barring
any nudist German ex-fiancés

15:49.825 --> 15:51.910
from slapping his strudel up
and down your sofa?

15:51.994 --> 15:53.704
How about pretending
to be a hero,

15:53.704 --> 15:57.124
but then caving the moment
a ferret bite breaks the skin?

15:57.124 --> 15:58.876
The skin of my eyelid.

15:58.876 --> 16:01.336
- That's how they kiss.
- Are you serious?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.719
Enough! Enough!

16:08.719 --> 16:10.387
You all have someone
who loves you,

16:10.387 --> 16:12.347
and you're screwing it up,
and over what?

16:12.431 --> 16:14.057
Who has the most power?

16:14.141 --> 16:15.642
That's not love.

16:15.726 --> 16:17.853
Love is trusting someone enough

16:17.853 --> 16:19.730
to tell them
what's really bothering you.

16:19.730 --> 16:20.981
So that's what we're gonna do.

16:20.981 --> 16:22.232
You, start.

16:25.611 --> 16:27.988
When you got scared
about Marvin,

16:27.988 --> 16:30.115
it felt like you were saying that

16:30.199 --> 16:34.161
I'm not as good a parent as you.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.746
You're an amazing mom,

16:35.746 --> 16:38.457
and I want to live up to that.

16:40.792 --> 16:43.462
Well, I probably have
trust issues

16:43.462 --> 16:45.923
because my dad
wasn't there for me.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.884
But I know that you'll always
be there to catch Marvin.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.221
You, next.

16:54.473 --> 16:57.559
Having Klaus back in our lives

16:57.643 --> 17:01.813
made me scared we're never
gonna escape the past.

17:01.897 --> 17:03.357
I only wanted to help Klaus

17:03.357 --> 17:06.944
because I feel guilty
about how happy I am with you.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.905
Next.

17:11.031 --> 17:13.075
I find you so sexy,

17:13.075 --> 17:16.203
it just hurt that you don't feel
the same about me.

17:18.163 --> 17:22.084
I get turned on watching myself
do the news during sex.

17:22.084 --> 17:24.753
Oh.

17:24.837 --> 17:26.547
Well, that's cool.

17:30.092 --> 17:32.094
Look at that,
no legal documents needed.

17:32.094 --> 17:35.430
Just honesty and vulnerability.
That's love.

17:35.514 --> 17:37.850
You see, I once loved someone,

17:37.850 --> 17:39.643
only I didn't say it enough.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.104
Now I wish I could
say it every day.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.648
Hell, I don't care if it's crazy,

17:44.648 --> 17:47.401
I-I'm doing it.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.236
Hello, Darlene?

17:49.236 --> 17:51.488
Put Tugboat on the line.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.949
Hey, buddy.
Hey, it's the man.

17:56.076 --> 17:59.872
<i>And for a moment,
all felt right with the world.</i>

17:59.872 --> 18:01.331
<i>But that very night,</i>

18:01.415 --> 18:04.585
<i>the Autumn of Breakups
would claim its first victims.</i>

18:04.585 --> 18:06.628
ROBIN <i>...wish you a very safe
and pleasant evening.</i>

18:06.712 --> 18:08.589
- Good night.
- Good night.

18:08.589 --> 18:10.257
Good night.

18:14.595 --> 18:18.807
Good night.

18:18.891 --> 18:20.184
<i>Gute Nacht.</i>

18:20.184 --> 18:22.853
And you too, my babies.
Oh, danke for the sweet eye kisses.

18:22.853 --> 18:24.688
Ow.

18:24.688 --> 18:27.316
- After you, sir.
- Ladies first.

18:27.316 --> 18:30.944
- I insist.
- I insist.

18:31.028 --> 18:33.197
- I'm not throwing mine out first.
- I'm not throwing mine out first.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.490
You've slept with half the women
in New York.

18:35.574 --> 18:36.783
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.036
You duped me out
of thousands of dollars.

18:39.036 --> 18:40.329
I'm the one who needs a prenup.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.039
I just thought
of some more stuff to add.

18:42.039 --> 18:44.416
I'm not half finished.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.549
Let's dive in.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.848
It should be simpler than this,
shouldn't it?

18:59.932 --> 19:02.309
Yeah.

19:02.309 --> 19:05.521
Maybe it should be.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.231
Barney, do you trust me?

19:11.193 --> 19:12.819
No.

19:14.738 --> 19:16.073
Do you trust me?

19:17.991 --> 19:19.326
No.

19:22.412 --> 19:24.957
If we really need something
this complicated

19:24.957 --> 19:26.542
to get married...

19:31.129 --> 19:33.298
Yeah.

19:33.382 --> 19:37.302
<i>I was anxious to be found</i>

19:38.512 --> 19:42.057
<i>You can always go home</i>

19:42.057 --> 19:47.062
<i>To the safety of your cloud</i>

19:47.062 --> 19:48.981
I'm sorry, buddy.

19:48.981 --> 19:51.441
Hey, there's always wives
two through eight.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.111
They sounded pretty hot
in your fantasy.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.571
All but wife seven.

19:55.571 --> 19:58.866
She was just there
'cause her dad was rich.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.952
Actually, I'm okay.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.413
I found out I'll never trust someone
enough to get married,

20:04.413 --> 20:06.707
and that's fine.

20:06.707 --> 20:10.794
My single life is,
and always will be,

20:10.878 --> 20:13.422
legen... Wait for it...

20:13.422 --> 20:15.465
<i>I turn around</i>

20:15.549 --> 20:16.925
...dary!

20:17.009 --> 20:19.887
My wedding
is gonna be legendary.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.265
So, prenup?

20:23.265 --> 20:25.350
Not this time.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.060
Oh, hey you.
Ready for lunch?

20:27.144 --> 20:28.437
Totally.

20:28.437 --> 20:29.855
Mmm.

20:31.398 --> 20:33.192
Thanks.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.278
See, Tugboat?

20:36.278 --> 20:37.779
That's love.

20:37.863 --> 20:39.406
Yeah.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.787
Okay, you see,

20:45.871 --> 20:48.624
Ludwig has started to polish
the doorknobs,

20:48.624 --> 20:52.169
but Wilhelm has
already completed this chore.

20:55.005 --> 20:57.007
Yeah.

20:57.007 --> 20:59.718
Ahh...

20:59.718 --> 21:02.513
You know,
it's big comedy,

21:02.513 --> 21:05.724
but you also really care
about these characters.

21:05.724 --> 21:08.477
<i>Wilhelm!</i>
