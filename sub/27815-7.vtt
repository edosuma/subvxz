00:00.384 --> 00:04.360
- I'm done. I got nothing left.
- You caught me on a good day.

00:05.808 --> 00:09.400
I have spoken to your cousin
Samuel in Nelson.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.000
Don't send me away, Mama.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.960
Tell the Elders to call me
when you arrive ?

00:17.084 --> 00:18.400
You think this is over, don't you ?

00:18.663 --> 00:21.280
You lost their drugs.
They are not gonna let this go.

00:21.360 --> 00:22.320
Enough !

00:22.400 --> 00:26.492
One of their men is dead, don't you
understand what that means for us ?

00:26.720 --> 00:29.880
Why would I understand anything about
this world you dragged me into ?

00:29.960 --> 00:31.480
You're going to give them
their drugs back,

00:31.560 --> 00:33.200
then get back to your family.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.240
Then you're going to let them know
what's coming.

00:35.320 --> 00:37.280
We'll not survive this without a fight.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.440
What's going on ? Tell me !

00:40.520 --> 00:42.200
I'm fucking scared.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.720
- Who's coming for all of us ?
- Liverpool.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.040
- How long have we got ?
- Not long.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.440
- You're not going to do it.
- I am.

01:21.520 --> 01:23.600
My God.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.640
What's it like ?

01:27.720 --> 01:32.880
Really good. Try it.
Trust me, it's really good.

01:33.200 --> 01:36.400
Alright, don't say anything.

01:41.160 --> 01:45.200
Jesus, that's rank.
That is disgusting.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.840
So, we good ?

01:47.920 --> 01:51.400
Yeah, we're good.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.520
Yeah, we're good.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.080
- Yummy !
- It's just rank.

02:15.240 --> 02:16.880
Everything alright ?

02:16.960 --> 02:20.400
- Peachy. Whose nicked the pickle ?
- Her.

02:21.280 --> 02:23.200
- It was her.
- Really ?

02:25.480 --> 02:27.160
How's that ?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.840
- That's fucking lovely.
- Bit vinegary ?

02:28.920 --> 02:33.040
No, it's nice.
Just a sec, let me check.

02:33.120 --> 02:38.400
- My God that's such a waste.
- Weird, ain't it ?

02:38.480 --> 02:42.440
- That's disgusting.
- No, it's not. It's delicious.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.800
You're a child.

02:49.480 --> 02:53.600
It's really good.

02:53.880 --> 02:57.160
No ! I had enough.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.840
There isn't any milkshake left in it.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.560
- That is vile.
- Lovely, shall we go ?

03:04.080 --> 03:05.720
- Yeah.
- It tastes pickly.

03:05.800 --> 03:07.960
- Did you pay ?
- Yes.

03:08.040 --> 03:10.200
Nice.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.720
Stop it !

03:50.480 --> 03:53.200
Turn it up.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.800
Chico !

04:42.480 --> 04:46.400
Chico !

04:52.560 --> 04:55.920
Stop ! That's Rosa's truck.

04:58.800 --> 05:00.640
Chico, easy.

05:00.760 --> 05:04.880
I got him. Call the cousins.
See Rosa has made it to Nelson.

05:28.200 --> 05:30.560
- What's going on ?
- He's just checking.

05:31.280 --> 05:33.960
He's just being safe.

06:02.560 --> 06:05.560
It's okay.

06:16.960 --> 06:21.880
TIN STAR

06:23.200 --> 06:24.800
Wait.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.680
Okay, Anna. Anna, be careful.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.880
Anna ?

06:38.120 --> 06:39.480
Shit.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.760
My God.

06:54.000 --> 06:58.800
- I don't know what to...
- I know.

07:01.920 --> 07:04.240
There you go. It's okay.

07:08.760 --> 07:10.840
Do you know what,
you go in the front.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.720
Let's get you to the front.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.640
Stay here, okay.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.240
Shit.

07:32.640 --> 07:34.840
Rosa !

07:35.760 --> 07:38.040
Rosa !

07:40.240 --> 07:42.600
Rosa !

08:40.080 --> 08:42.600
- I should tell her.
- No.

08:42.679 --> 08:47.280
No, darling,
you don't have to do that.

08:56.480 --> 08:58.520
Sarah.

09:01.760 --> 09:03.200
It's Rosa.

09:05.280 --> 09:07.200
- I'm so sorry.
- What ?

09:26.880 --> 09:29.120
What have you done to her ?

09:32.600 --> 09:34.760
Rosa...

09:41.120 --> 09:43.080
Rosa ?

09:48.040 --> 09:50.360
Please...

09:52.240 --> 09:55.240
Wake up.

10:01.480 --> 10:05.240
Sweetheart, will you do
something for me ?

10:05.320 --> 10:09.160
Will you find the prettiest bunch
of flowers you can find ?

10:09.400 --> 10:13.640
Go on.

10:15.320 --> 10:19.320
Stand up. Please. Wake up !

10:21.400 --> 10:23.320
Give her to me.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.400
Let her go. Sarah !

10:30.480 --> 10:32.840
Give her to me.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.280
Hans, come.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.200
Bloodshed follows bloodshed !

12:36.280 --> 12:40.280
Do not quote me scripture to me
that I already know !

12:41.280 --> 12:43.840
One of our children lies dead.

12:43.920 --> 12:47.840
We cannot simple stand by
and allow it to happen to another.

12:47.920 --> 12:50.880
Fredrick. If the time came, do you
really think you could use it ?

12:50.960 --> 12:54.840
And risk judgment. Not only from
the Lord, but from yourself ?

12:54.920 --> 12:59.080
If my damnation means the salvation
of the colony then so be it.

12:59.160 --> 13:02.440
I will do whatever needs to be done.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.840
I'm gonna stay a while.

13:31.920 --> 13:35.000
You guys go. I'm fine.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.000
We're not going anywhere, sweetheart.

13:41.480 --> 13:44.280
Would it help to talk about it ?

13:46.320 --> 13:48.520
Why isn't it me ?

13:49.160 --> 13:52.360
Why is it always the people
I love who die ?

13:53.480 --> 13:56.120
I don't have an answer for that.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.880
Life can be shit and random
and cruel sometimes.

14:02.400 --> 14:03.880
Yeah.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.000
It was the cartel, wasn't it ?

14:07.880 --> 14:10.960
- It looks that way.
- And it isn't finished ?

14:11.040 --> 14:15.040
- No. More to come.
- God...

14:16.080 --> 14:18.480
I feel sick.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.560
- It's okay, sweetheart.
- No, it's not. Aren't you scared ?

14:21.640 --> 14:23.680
- Yes, of course I'm scared.
- Well, you never show it ?

14:23.760 --> 14:26.920
That's because I'm your mommy,
that's my job.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.960
I don't want lose you.
I don't want to lose either of you.

15:08.960 --> 15:11.000
Won't be long.

15:12.600 --> 15:14.840
Anna, okay.

15:38.640 --> 15:42.320
- Constable.
- This is for you.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.320
It came this morning.
I didn't see who dropped it off.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.960
Who is it ?

16:29.120 --> 16:31.920
- Dead man.
- Let me help.

16:33.280 --> 16:35.080
I owe you.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.800
- You don't owe me.
- What about Elizabeth ?

16:46.320 --> 16:49.200
She's probably in Rome by now.

17:00.640 --> 17:03.440
Why don't we call in the Feds ?

17:03.880 --> 17:07.560
You should go,
you should just fucking go.

17:08.839 --> 17:10.800
Who's coming ?

17:16.200 --> 17:18.560
Nothing's worth this.

17:26.480 --> 17:29.200
Take care of yourself.

19:28.220 --> 19:32.340
That's it, yep, it's good.

19:32.480 --> 19:36.700
All those years when it was just us,
I thought you were proper boring.

19:36.940 --> 19:39.300
Charming.

19:43.620 --> 19:46.580
What other secrets are you hiding ?

19:55.660 --> 19:57.740
Good, do it again.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.780
That's it.

20:05.100 --> 20:08.980
Keep it on you, okay ? Anna.

20:11.340 --> 20:13.060
Trust yourself.

20:34.300 --> 20:38.100
Hey, let's get you home.

20:43.180 --> 20:44.860
Let's go.

24:44.380 --> 24:46.860
God bless you.

24:51.980 --> 24:53.780
God be with you.

25:10.020 --> 25:12.220
- I should go.
- No. Stay. Please.

25:47.900 --> 25:50.300
Grant us strength, Lord,
God almighty,

25:50.380 --> 25:53.260
creator of all things,
to remember that there hasn't,

25:53.340 --> 25:56.980
nor shall ever be,
a time your love hasn't existed.

25:57.060 --> 26:01.580
For it is love that nourishes our souls
in this life on earth and in heaven.

26:01.860 --> 26:05.020
Grant us strength, Lord, to instill
within us the courage and faith

26:05.100 --> 26:08.020
to endure that which
we cannot understand.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.980
Grant us strength, Lord,

26:10.060 --> 26:12.300
send your holy spirit to guide us,

26:12.380 --> 26:16.740
lest through fear we recoil from living
and dwell in the darkness of grief.

26:38.780 --> 26:42.660
- Blessed be the name of the Lord.
- Amen.

26:43.620 --> 26:47.180
It is done.
Your period of mourning is over.

26:47.260 --> 26:50.700
- What ?
- We have absolved you of your grief.

26:53.900 --> 26:56.100
I'm not sure it's that simple.

26:56.180 --> 26:59.020
We wouldn't expect
an outsider to understand.

26:59.100 --> 27:04.380
Sarah, you know from now on it
is forbidden to grieve in public.

27:05.220 --> 27:07.780
Prolonged grief
is surely sacrilegious.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.740
Don't touch me.

27:10.820 --> 27:14.340
I understand very well
what's is expected of me

27:15.980 --> 27:18.820
and I thank you all for coming.

27:19.140 --> 27:21.420
And now I'll ask you to leave.

27:21.820 --> 27:23.340
Please, leave.

29:22.900 --> 29:26.940
Sarah, I don't know these women,

29:28.140 --> 29:31.500
but if they knew anything
about losing a child,

29:34.740 --> 29:38.100
they would know there's no way
to control grief.

29:40.380 --> 29:44.300
- A part of me has gone.
- The best part.

29:46.460 --> 29:47.580
Love.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.540
Thank you.

29:53.660 --> 29:58.820
- I think I need to be alone with her.
- Yes, of course.

30:24.460 --> 30:28.340
Sleep my child, sleep.

30:37.500 --> 30:41.060
Come, sit with us.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.780
I can't.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.720
Safety's on you, numpty.

31:16.960 --> 31:20.400
- Dickhead.
- Right.

31:45.320 --> 31:47.400
Go on, then.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.280
Would you rather,

31:58.000 --> 32:00.640
get eaten by a gorilla

32:01.920 --> 32:04.920
or an ostrich ?

32:10.880 --> 32:14.720
I think a gorilla really cause
it'd be quicker. Know what I mean ?

32:14.800 --> 32:18.400
I mean, an ostrich,
you'd just get pecked to death.

32:18.920 --> 32:22.200
- I got chased by an ostrich once.
- Did you ?

32:22.280 --> 32:25.000
Yeah. Got out of the car
in the wrong place.

32:25.360 --> 32:27.320
True story.

32:28.560 --> 32:31.240
Which you rather,

32:34.160 --> 32:36.840
eat o ton of rice pudding

32:37.640 --> 32:39.440
or

32:40.080 --> 32:42.680
a ton of tapioca ?

32:44.040 --> 32:48.320
- I've never tried tapioca.
- It's like frogs spawn.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.800
It's fucking disgusting.

32:51.520 --> 32:55.760
I think I'd still have to go for
the tapioca. I hate rice pudding.

32:55.960 --> 32:57.560
I can't do rice pudding.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.280
You are the ultimate noisy neighbor.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.440
They ain't seen nothing yet.

33:17.640 --> 33:20.160
Yes. Rosa would've loved this.

33:22.520 --> 33:25.600
- Yes !
- You are not driving.

33:25.680 --> 33:29.160
You are not fucking driving.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.400
I'm fucking driving.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.760
We all share your grief, Johan.

34:04.280 --> 34:09.159
A man should have the right
to protect his family, his home.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.760
Shepard his flock.

34:12.440 --> 34:16.760
So we stand with you, Johan,
whatever may come.

34:21.679 --> 34:23.639
Sorry.

34:31.719 --> 34:37.000
The first shall be last
and the last shall be first.

34:38.000 --> 34:39.960
Amen.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.640
What ?

35:40.360 --> 35:43.400
- Is this it ?
- I guess so.

35:55.560 --> 35:58.720
You know what this means now
for these people. Don't you, Jack ?

36:00.440 --> 36:02.600
Well, I'm not okay with it.

36:03.240 --> 36:05.040
We need to warn them.
Give them a chance to leave.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.600
She's up there
with her dead baby.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.080
- Here.
- What's that ?

36:34.520 --> 36:37.080
- Did you love him ?
- What ?

36:39.120 --> 36:42.360
- Did you love him ?
- I fucking heard what you said !

36:43.280 --> 36:46.120
- Just stalling then.
- Why would you say that ?

36:46.200 --> 36:48.720
- Why would you even ask me that ?
- Do you love me ?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.720
Fuck off.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.320
- It's a simple question, Ange.
- How dare you ?

36:56.400 --> 36:59.280
How dare you after everything
we've been through ?

36:59.360 --> 37:02.840
How dare you question
my love for you ?

37:04.040 --> 37:07.600
You don't care who you use. You don't
care who you hurt. Do you, Jack ?

37:09.800 --> 37:12.520
You gave me permission to kill him.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.240
That was a long time ago.

37:17.320 --> 37:20.840
And I know it was fucking hard
for you to do,

37:22.440 --> 37:24.400
but you gave it.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.920
Cause you knew that when the time came
there, was no other way. You gave it.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.680
I can't think of any other way.

37:41.480 --> 37:43.200
You have to trust me, love.

38:05.840 --> 38:07.760
Jack...

38:09.440 --> 38:11.920
We have to tell Anna.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.320
One, two,

38:19.520 --> 38:23.400
three, four, five,

38:23.840 --> 38:27.160
six, seven,

38:27.240 --> 38:31.000
eight, nine, ten.

38:32.680 --> 38:35.480
Coming, ready or not !

38:41.440 --> 38:43.400
Thomas ?

38:49.440 --> 38:51.520
Thomas ?

39:03.680 --> 39:05.800
Thomas ?

39:55.960 --> 39:57.440
Hey.

40:25.800 --> 40:28.480
Thank you for bringing her home.

40:30.320 --> 40:32.680
The least I could do.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.880
Why are you still doing here,
Mr. Worth ?

40:37.720 --> 40:40.920
You have a family, a daughter...

40:43.280 --> 40:45.080
You could just go ?

40:46.280 --> 40:48.600
I don't need you anymore.

40:51.000 --> 40:53.880
Men like you killed my little girl.

40:54.680 --> 40:57.840
No, men like you killed
your little girl.

41:18.520 --> 41:20.560
What's it like,

41:22.120 --> 41:23.240
to kill a man ?

41:26.800 --> 41:31.320
- I have no idea.
- Must do something to you.

41:32.720 --> 41:36.000
Puts the soul in turmoil.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.200
Do you remember them all ?

41:42.080 --> 41:44.200
The men you've killed ?

41:46.480 --> 41:49.840
I've been with men
in their last moments too.

41:51.560 --> 41:55.120
Some were frightened,
some were sure.

41:56.880 --> 42:01.840
Those who were frightened
were still lying to themselves,

42:01.920 --> 42:05.840
about who they were
or what they had become,

42:07.440 --> 42:09.760
those who were sure,

42:10.720 --> 42:12.960
were at peace.

42:17.440 --> 42:20.280
I'm not lying anymore, Mr. Worth,

42:21.720 --> 42:24.160
nor am I afraid,

42:24.240 --> 42:27.960
not of you, nor of any man.

42:29.040 --> 42:33.400
When I die, the last thing
I want to see

42:33.480 --> 42:38.160
is the face of every
fucking man I have killed.

42:44.360 --> 42:46.200
Yeah.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.760
Good luck with that.
