WEBVTT

02:13.467 --> 02:15.378
That's a lovely name.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.507
Where are the rest of your people?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.226
There's only me.

02:27.189 --> 02:28.565
How did you get here?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.189
The same way you got here.

02:32.695 --> 02:34.060
By accident.

02:39.327 --> 02:40.407
How long...

02:40.494 --> 02:43.531
Every question I answer
will simply lead to another question.

02:44.123 --> 02:47.286
You should rest.
Just be grateful you're alive.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.499
There were other people on my ship.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.171
- I need to go...
- No!

02:54.258 --> 02:57.500
If there are other people on the island,
lwill find them.

03:03.684 --> 03:04.969
The baby?

03:14.945 --> 03:16.276
It's coming.

03:23.829 --> 03:24.989
That's it.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.037
Push.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.240
- Push harder!
- I can't!

03:29.335 --> 03:30.620
Yes, you can.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.878
That's good.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.045
One more push.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.231
It's a boy.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.940
His name is Jacob.

04:02.034 --> 04:03.490
It's a boy.

04:12.211 --> 04:13.747
Can l...?

04:22.179 --> 04:23.259
There's another baby.

04:25.975 --> 04:27.215
Push again.

04:28.853 --> 04:29.888
Here it comes.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.849
Now!

04:41.115 --> 04:42.446
It's another boy.

04:47.746 --> 04:49.953
| only picked one name.

05:08.726 --> 05:10.341
May | see him?

05:20.779 --> 05:21.814
I'm sorry.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.419
What is it?

06:27.012 --> 06:29.003
It's a game. You play it.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.812
How do you know how?

06:39.608 --> 06:40.723
| just know.

06:44.238 --> 06:45.819
Will you show me how to play?

06:46.407 --> 06:48.068
If you promise not to tell Mother.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.651
- Why can't we tell her?
- Because she'll take it away.

06:53.289 --> 06:56.156
So, do you wanna play
or don't you, Jacob?

07:01.880 --> 07:04.337
Yes. I wanna play.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.100
Hello, Jacob.

07:17.187 --> 07:18.393
Hello, Mother.

07:19.315 --> 07:20.680
Where's your brother?

07:21.817 --> 07:23.318
He's down at the beach.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.275
Staring out at the ocean.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.451
Can I help you?

07:35.539 --> 07:37.370
If you like, you can sort that.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.788
What were you and your brother
doing down at the beach?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.840
We were just... walking.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.222
Do you love me, Jacob?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.890
- Yes.
- Then tell me what happened.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.449
May | join you?

08:23.212 --> 08:24.292
Sure.

08:32.137 --> 08:33.673
Jacob told you what I found.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.595
Of course he did.

08:35.683 --> 08:39.050
Jacob doesn't know how to lie.
He's not like you.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.598
Why? What am I like?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.431
You're...

08:47.945 --> 08:49.185
...special.

08:54.618 --> 08:58.110
- Can I keep the game?
- Of course you can.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.786
That's why I left it for you.

09:00.499 --> 09:03.536
- It came from you?
- Of course it did.

09:03.627 --> 09:05.333
Where else would it come from?

09:08.006 --> 09:09.462
From somewhere else.

09:10.551 --> 09:11.791
Across the sea.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.633
There is nowhere else.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.548
The island is all there is.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.933
Then where did we come from?

09:23.897 --> 09:27.139
You and your brother came from me,
and I came from my mother.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.644
Where is she?

09:30.446 --> 09:33.233
- She's dead.
- What's "dead"?

09:36.702 --> 09:39.034
Something you will never have
to worry about.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.138
Hurry up! He's getting away!

10:07.316 --> 10:08.431
Hide.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.742
Who are they?

10:46.730 --> 10:47.970
Mother!

10:48.690 --> 10:50.681
Mother!

10:52.569 --> 10:53.729
What's wrong?

10:54.780 --> 10:57.317
We saw people. Men.

10:57.407 --> 11:00.774
- How many were there?
- Three. They killed a boar.

11:00.869 --> 11:02.075
Did they see you?

11:03.080 --> 11:04.911
No. I don't think so.

11:05.457 --> 11:08.494
Where did they come from?
They looked like us.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.496
They're not like us.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.543
They don't belong here.

11:12.631 --> 11:14.963
- We are here for a reason.
- What reason?

11:22.307 --> 11:23.342
It's not time yet.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.970
Mother, what reason?

11:31.483 --> 11:33.189
Come with me.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.780
- Did you know about the people?
- Yes.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.453
- Why didn't you tell us about them?
- They're dangerous,

11:46.540 --> 11:48.997
- I didn't want to frighten you.
- What makes them dangerous?

11:49.084 --> 11:50.870
The same thing that makes
all men dangerous.

11:50.961 --> 11:54.169
They come. They fight.
They destroy. They corrupt.

11:54.256 --> 11:55.746
And it always ends the same.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.587
They "come"? Come from where?

11:59.678 --> 12:02.385
Another part of the island.
You're never to go looking for them.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.929
- lfthey found you, they'd hurt you.
- Why would they hurt us?

12:05.017 --> 12:07.508
Because they're people, Jacob,
and that's what people do.

12:07.603 --> 12:10.561
But we're people. Does that mean
that we can hurt each other?

12:17.154 --> 12:19.736
I've made it so you can never
hurt each other.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.124
What is this place?

12:33.211 --> 12:35.293
This is the reason we're here.

12:52.689 --> 12:53.895
Don't go in there.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.363
- What's down there?
- A light.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.200
The warmest,

13:08.288 --> 13:11.155
brightest light
you've ever seen or felt.

13:12.876 --> 13:17.085
And we must make sure
that no one ever finds it.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.205
It's beautiful.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.803
Yes, it is.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.752
And that's why they want it,

13:25.847 --> 13:28.224
because a little bit
of this very same light

13:28.308 --> 13:30.173
is inside of every man.

13:31.937 --> 13:33.598
But they always want more.

13:34.231 --> 13:37.098
- Can they take it?
- No, but they would try.

13:37.526 --> 13:39.357
And if they tried,
they could put it out.

13:39.444 --> 13:41.560
And if the light goes out here...

13:44.533 --> 13:46.148
...it goes out everywhere.

13:47.619 --> 13:49.826
And so I've protected this place,

13:49.913 --> 13:52.074
but I can't protect it forever.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.243
Then who will?

14:01.425 --> 14:03.381
It will have to be one of you.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.406
- You can't do that, Jacob.
- Why not?

14:28.493 --> 14:30.324
Because it's against the rules.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.619
- You made the rules.
- I found it.

14:32.706 --> 14:34.367
One day, you can
make up your own game,

14:34.458 --> 14:36.790
and everyone else
will have to follow your rules.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.206
It's all right.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.380
Don't be afraid.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.426
What?

14:57.189 --> 14:59.851
- What's wrong?
- I'm going for a walk to the beach.

15:00.817 --> 15:02.398
I'll meet you later.

15:08.450 --> 15:09.860
Hello.

15:13.330 --> 15:15.036
Why can't Jacob see you?

15:15.665 --> 15:16.871
Because I'm dead.

15:19.211 --> 15:22.795
Will you come with me?
I'd like to show you something.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.341
Show me what?

15:26.843 --> 15:28.003
Where you came from.

15:28.095 --> 15:32.259
lt's across the island,
a place you've never seen.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.448
Who are they?

15:59.543 --> 16:02.330
They came here 13 years ago,

16:03.255 --> 16:05.337
the day before you were born.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.340
Their ship was wrecked in a storm.

16:09.010 --> 16:11.467
"Ship"? What's that?

16:11.555 --> 16:14.217
It's a way for people to get
from one place to another.

16:15.559 --> 16:17.641
It's how we came across the sea.

16:18.854 --> 16:21.140
But there's nothing across the sea.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.892
There are many things across the sea.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.355
You come from across the sea, too.

16:28.446 --> 16:30.607
No. That's not true.

16:31.741 --> 16:33.242
That's not what my mother told me.

16:34.744 --> 16:36.359
She's not your mother.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.826
I am.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.133
Jacob.

17:01.271 --> 17:02.602
Jacob, wake up.

17:04.399 --> 17:05.764
Come with me.

17:12.616 --> 17:14.106
Why do you have all your things?

17:14.201 --> 17:15.441
They're our things.

17:16.453 --> 17:19.035
I took them because we're leaving,
and never coming back.

17:19.122 --> 17:20.362
What?

17:20.457 --> 17:22.448
Just follow me.

17:22.542 --> 17:23.782
Follow you where?

17:25.503 --> 17:27.368
- To the people.
- No.

17:27.464 --> 17:30.126
- We're supposed to stay away.
- They're our people.

17:30.217 --> 17:32.458
- We're gonna live with them.
- No, Mother said...

17:32.552 --> 17:35.385
She lied. She lied
about everything... all of it.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.305
I know you don't understand,
but you have to come with me.

17:38.391 --> 17:41.053
- I don't want to go by myself.
- We can't. Mother loves us.

17:41.144 --> 17:42.429
- She doesn't love us.
- Stop!

17:42.520 --> 17:43.600
- ltwas all a lie!
- Stop it!

17:43.688 --> 17:44.894
She's not even our mother!

17:49.319 --> 17:50.650
No!

17:50.737 --> 17:52.898
Jacob! What are you doing?

17:52.989 --> 17:55.856
He's leaving! He's going to them!

17:55.951 --> 17:57.737
To the other people!

17:59.329 --> 18:00.660
What?

18:01.748 --> 18:02.988
I know now.

18:03.625 --> 18:05.741
There is another place across the sea.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.918
It's where I'm from,
and I'm gonna go there.

18:09.005 --> 18:10.666
I'm gonna go home.

18:10.757 --> 18:13.499
- Who told you that?
- My mother!

18:17.013 --> 18:19.174
- I'm your mother.
- You killed my mother.

18:24.521 --> 18:27.308
Jacob, she was your mother, too.

18:29.276 --> 18:32.018
We don't belong here.
We don't belong with her.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.561
Come with me.

18:42.372 --> 18:43.532
No.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.996
My love, you need to know this.

18:49.796 --> 18:52.458
Whatever you have been told,

18:52.549 --> 18:55.040
you will never be able
to leave this island.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.625
That's not true.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.381
And one day, I can prove it.

19:35.050 --> 19:37.211
- Do you think he'll come back?
- No.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.254
He said you killed our mother.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.766
Is that true?

19:49.773 --> 19:50.762
Yes.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.479
lfl had let her live,

19:56.571 --> 19:59.153
she would have taken you
back to her people,

19:59.240 --> 20:02.323
and those people are bad,
Jacob, very bad.

20:03.787 --> 20:06.278
I couldn't let you
become one of them.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.369
I needed you to stay good.

20:12.670 --> 20:13.955
Am I good, Mother?

20:16.758 --> 20:19.875
Yes. Of course you are.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.589
Then why do you love him more than me?

20:34.484 --> 20:38.193
I love you in different ways.

20:43.076 --> 20:45.192
Will you stay with me, Jacob?

20:48.331 --> 20:49.491
Please?

20:54.212 --> 20:55.497
Yes...

21:00.176 --> 21:02.007
...for a while.

21:20.530 --> 21:21.940
What do you think?

21:24.868 --> 21:26.779
It's very nice, Jacob.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.036
Are you all right?

21:32.625 --> 21:34.126
l'mjust tired.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.808
She know you visit me?

22:02.530 --> 22:03.986
She never asks about you.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.522
Then I'm sorry I asked about her.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.157
Why do you watch us, Jacob?

22:18.755 --> 22:20.996
I watch because...

22:21.090 --> 22:23.752
- ...I wanna know if Mother's right.
- Right about what?

22:24.928 --> 22:26.134
About them.

22:26.221 --> 22:28.507
You mean my people.

22:28.598 --> 22:30.964
You wanna know if they're bad.

22:33.728 --> 22:36.891
That woman may be insane,
but she's definitely right about that.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.768
I don't know.
They don't seem so bad to me.

22:39.859 --> 22:41.850
Well, that's easy for you to say,

22:41.945 --> 22:43.810
looking down at us from above.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.942
Trust me. I've lived among them
for 30 years.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.449
They're greedy, manipulative...

22:51.162 --> 22:52.618
...untrustworthy. ..

22:53.748 --> 22:54.828
...and selfish.

22:55.416 --> 22:56.952
Then why are you with them?

22:58.628 --> 22:59.913
They're a means to an end.

23:01.965 --> 23:03.045
What end?

23:11.391 --> 23:13.473
I'm leaving, Jacob.

23:16.312 --> 23:17.927
I found a way off the island.

23:18.022 --> 23:20.479
No, it's impossible.
There is no way off the island.

23:48.595 --> 23:51.132
There are very smart men among us,

23:51.222 --> 23:53.884
men who are curious
about how things work.

23:53.975 --> 23:57.968
Together, we have discovered
places all over this island

23:58.062 --> 24:01.179
where metal behaves strangely.

24:01.274 --> 24:04.732
When we find one of these sites, we dig.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.395
And this time we found something.

24:11.159 --> 24:13.992
Come with me, Jacob, please.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.322
What are you gonna do when she dies?

24:19.417 --> 24:22.409
- She's never gonna die.
- Jacob, everything dies.

24:23.004 --> 24:25.245
Well, I don't wanna leave this island.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.625
It's my home.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.633
Well, it's not mine.

24:39.646 --> 24:40.886
Where were you?

24:43.566 --> 24:45.067
You know where l was.

24:48.404 --> 24:49.655
What did he say to you, Jacob?

24:53.326 --> 24:55.567
Said he's finally found a way
to leave the island.

25:56.180 --> 25:57.636
May | join you?

26:00.518 --> 26:01.758
Yes.

26:13.281 --> 26:14.566
How are you?

26:15.283 --> 26:16.489
I'm worried.

26:17.326 --> 26:18.907
Well, Mother, you should be.

26:20.246 --> 26:23.830
I've spent 30 years searching for
that place you brought me as a child,

26:23.916 --> 26:26.532
that... waterfall
with that beautiful light.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.243
l've walked this island from end to end,

26:29.338 --> 26:31.795
not once coming close to finding it.

26:33.092 --> 26:36.880
But then I began to think,
what if the light underneath the island,

26:36.971 --> 26:39.337
what if! could get to it
from someplace else?

26:40.850 --> 26:43.967
Figuring out how to reach it
took a very long time.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.933
The people with you,
they saw this, too?

26:48.024 --> 26:49.264
Yes.

26:49.901 --> 26:53.109
They have some very interesting
ideas about what to do with it.

26:53.196 --> 26:55.733
Do with it?
You don't have any idea wh...

26:55.823 --> 26:59.691
l have no idea because
you wouldn't tell me, Mother.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.938
What is that?

27:35.738 --> 27:36.773
It's a wheel.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.360
We're going to make an opening...

27:41.661 --> 27:43.652
...one much bigger than this one.

27:45.122 --> 27:48.080
And then I'm going to attach that wheel
to a system we're building...

27:49.252 --> 27:52.244
A system that channels
the water and the light.

27:53.214 --> 27:55.000
And then I'm going to turn it.

27:55.091 --> 27:56.627
And when I do...

27:58.970 --> 28:02.133
...l'll finally be able
to leave this place.

28:02.223 --> 28:03.804
How do you know all this?

28:04.600 --> 28:07.558
- How do you know it will work?
- l'm special...

28:07.645 --> 28:09.181
...Mother.

28:10.147 --> 28:12.103
Please don't do this.

28:14.443 --> 28:16.855
- Don't go.
- l have to go.

28:18.281 --> 28:20.818
- Why?
- Because I don't belong here.

28:25.788 --> 28:28.780
Then I suppose this is goodbye.

28:54.567 --> 28:56.273
Goodbye, Mother.

29:05.369 --> 29:08.452
I am so sorry.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.134
Jacob.

29:32.855 --> 29:34.356
It's time.

29:40.529 --> 29:42.440
- Something happened, didn't it?
- Yes.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.317
I had to say good bye to your brother.

29:44.408 --> 29:45.614
You're letting him go?

29:45.701 --> 29:48.283
I don't have a choice.
It's what he wants.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.416
Do you recognize this place?

29:57.338 --> 29:58.544
Yes.

29:58.631 --> 30:00.667
Do you remember
what I showed you here?

30:02.134 --> 30:03.715
The light.

30:06.055 --> 30:08.091
You're going to protect it now.

30:14.021 --> 30:15.602
What's down there?

30:15.690 --> 30:18.102
Life. Death.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.402
Rebirth.

30:20.486 --> 30:24.354
It's the source,
the heart of the island.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.117
Just promise me...

30:35.376 --> 30:38.789
...no matter what you do,
you won't ever go down there.

30:43.884 --> 30:45.294
Would I die?

30:45.386 --> 30:47.468
It'd be worse than dying, Jacob.

30:48.681 --> 30:49.841
Much worse.

31:20.504 --> 31:22.961
Here. Drink this.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.669
What happens if I do?

31:25.760 --> 31:28.297
You accept the responsibility

31:28.387 --> 31:32.130
that you will protect this place
for as long as you can.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.348
Then you'll have to find
your replacement.

31:35.436 --> 31:38.018
- I don't want to protect this place.
- Someone has to.

31:38.105 --> 31:40.141
- I don't care.
- My time is over.

31:40.232 --> 31:42.348
- Why is your time over?
- It has to be you, Jacob.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.729
No, it doesn't.
You wanted it to be him.

31:47.990 --> 31:49.901
But now I'm all you have.

31:53.954 --> 31:56.445
It was always supposed to be you, Jacob.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.247
| see that now,

31:59.335 --> 32:02.168
and one day you'll see it, too,
but until then...

32:04.048 --> 32:06.380
...you don't really have a choice.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.926
Please.

32:11.013 --> 32:13.425
Take the cup and drink.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.085
Now you and l...

32:49.176 --> 32:50.712
...are the same.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.162
Storm comin'.

34:53.175 --> 34:54.676
Yes, there is.

34:56.345 --> 35:01.715
You should go,
get some firewood before it rains.

35:05.396 --> 35:06.852
Jacob?

35:09.191 --> 35:12.274
- Be careful.
- I'll see you back home.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.992
Why wouldn't you let me leave, Mother?

36:51.085 --> 36:52.291
Because”.

36:53.087 --> 36:54.418
...I love you.

36:58.509 --> 36:59.874
Thank you.

37:22.491 --> 37:24.607
- Jacob.
- What did you do?

37:24.701 --> 37:26.407
Wait. Listen.

37:27.621 --> 37:29.157
- What did you do?
- No.

37:29.248 --> 37:30.829
- What did you do?!
- Wait!

37:46.348 --> 37:48.179
Don't. Jacob, don't do this.

37:49.476 --> 37:51.137
She burned them.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.219
She was crazy.
She burned them all!

37:54.481 --> 37:57.769
You can't kill me, Jacob.
She made it that way. You can't!

37:57.860 --> 38:00.852
Don't worry, brother.
I'm not going to kill you.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.665
- She brought you back here?
- Yes.

38:18.755 --> 38:20.291
Why would she?

38:20.382 --> 38:22.714
Because I have to protect it now.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.133
You want to find the light?

38:29.224 --> 38:31.476
You want to leave this place, Brother?
Then go.

41:20.020 --> 41:22.762
Who are they?
Where did they come from?

41:22.856 --> 41:24.721
Didn't you guys
shoot a polar bear last week?

41:25.567 --> 41:28.104
- Yeah.
- Where'd that come from?

41:44.544 --> 41:46.705
Hello? Anybody there?

41:50.801 --> 41:53.759
- Who were these men?
- Actually, one of them's female.

41:57.265 --> 41:59.096
Our very own Adam and Eve.

42:07.984 --> 42:09.394
Goodbye, Brother.

42:15.992 --> 42:17.198
Goodbye.
