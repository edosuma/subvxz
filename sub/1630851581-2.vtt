like to go with me on a...?

01:30.173 --> 01:32.426
(Groans) OK.

01:32.426 --> 01:37.389
Yo, Carla! I found
these two tickets on the ground

01:37.389 --> 01:42.269
and I was wondering if...
Ugh! I'm so lame!

01:42.269 --> 01:44.813
Hey!

01:44.813 --> 01:48.567
Oh, sorry, kid, but Solarman
needs a touch of make‐up!

01:52.487 --> 01:54.281
‐ Ugh!
‐ Oh, Sergio!

01:54.656 --> 01:57.951
You're such a cutie!
(Kissing sounds)

‐ Oh, hey, Andy!

03:26.289 --> 03:28.708
Do you smell a stinky cologne?

03:28.708 --> 03:32.462
Oh! Wait, wait.
This smell's coming from you.

03:32.462 --> 03:35.006
‐ Uh...
‐ Oh! Easy!

03:35.006 --> 03:37.592
You, Andy, wanna go
to the fair with Carla.

03:37.592 --> 03:40.512
‐ What? How did you... ?
‐ It's simple, my friend!

03:40.512 --> 03:43.557
You smell of cologne, you have
two tickets to the fair,

03:43.557 --> 03:45.183

05:13.647 --> 05:16.942
‐ New York was founded...
‐ Ugh! Open the window!

05:18.568 --> 05:20.987
‐ What did you do now?
‐ Just put on deodorant.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.490
Ugh! On top of the cologne?

05:23.490 --> 05:26.493
Andy, one strong smell
does not cancel out another.

05:26.493 --> 05:29.454
‐ It just makes a bigger stink!
‐ Yo, Andy!

05:29.454 --> 05:31.414
Did you fall
in the toilet bowl or what?

05:31.414 --> 05:33.500

Aw, come on!
I don't smell that bad!

05:46.096 --> 05:50.392
It's not you, Andy.
(Coughs) This is a toxic ghost!

05:50.392 --> 05:53.562
Ha, ha! You see?
I'm not the one who stinks!

05:53.562 --> 05:57.274

07:40.835 --> 07:42.754

two tickets for the fair

11:37.989 --> 11:41.576

well, if you'd go with me...

11:41.576 --> 11:44.913
‐ Uh... I mean, if you want.
‐ Oh, I'd love to.

11:44.913 --> 11:48.499
But didn't you hear?
It closed because of some ghost.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.710
It'll take years to clean it.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.547
Oh! That reminds me, I need to
buy a new coat. See ya, Andy!

11:54.547 --> 11:57.467
Uh, yeah. A new coat. Right.

11:57.467 --> 11:58.593

Whoa!

13:07.495 --> 13:08.705
Awesome model!

13:09.497 --> 13:11.749
It makes me feel like
even more of a giant than usual.

13:11.749 --> 13:13.835
‐ Thanks, I spent ages on it.
‐ Good.

13:13.835 --> 13:16.754
'Cause you're telling
the teacher we made it together.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.882
‐ Why would I do that?
‐ 'Cause I'm bigger and older

13:19.882 --> 13:23.678
than you, Junior! And 'cause
I'm not asking, I'm telling!

13:30.643 --> 13:33.479

13:44.991 --> 13:47.243
Stop! It's fragile!
You're gonna...

13:49.746 --> 13:52.331
break it!

13:52.331 --> 13:55.460
Next time, mess with somebody
your own size!

13:55.460 --> 13:59.047
The lights are out
all over my mini masterpiece.

13:59.047 --> 14:02.633

14:07.805 --> 14:08.848
Well played, Bakers!

14:13.519 --> 14:15.563
I could've
dealt with that on my own.

14:15.563 --> 14:18.816
The dead battery? I'm on it.
I got a spare one in my locker!

14:18.816 --> 14:22.987
‐ Let's catch up at the library!
‐ I can get my own battery.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.781
Cool.
Liv's on the battery sitch,

14:24.781 --> 14:26.449

14:32.789 --> 14:36.417

‐ Dude, seriously?
‐ You're welcome.

15:00.650 --> 15:03.569
Lemme know if you want me to
get rid of the real Drake too.

15:03.569 --> 15:06.572
Just 'cause I skipped a year
doesn't make you my babysitter!

15:06.572 --> 15:09.909
Fine, just trying to
look out for you, little bud...

15:09.909 --> 15:12.870

Ah! There!

15:18.543 --> 15:20.253
(Coughing)

15:23.506 --> 15:28.511
There you go. Perfect scale.
Though a bit more graceful.

15:28.511 --> 15:31.472
‐ Keep out of this, Baker!
‐ Maybe give ballet a try?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.683
Basketball
isn't working out for ya!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.560
(Laughter)

15:52.451 --> 15:54.036
What is... ?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.462
‐ (Running steps)
‐ Huh? Who?

16:03.462 --> 16:05.339
Express delivery for Mr...

16:05.339 --> 16:06.716
(Gasps)

16:07.717 --> 16:09.177
Where is everyone?

16:14.432 --> 16:16.142
Aaah!

16:21.397 --> 16:23.566
‐ Hustle, sis!
‐ Fascinating!

16:23.566 --> 16:26.152
A ghost that can shrink matter
means it must be working

16:26.152 --> 16:28.571
‐ at an atomic scale!
‐ How about we capture it

16:28.571 --> 16:31.532
and then analyse it.
Let's go, Ghost Force.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.868
What are you doing?
Everyone's gonna see you.

16:36.162 --> 16:39.457
Wow! You're way too cool
for this school!

16:39.457 --> 16:44.420
‐ Oh, yeah? Not as cool as us!
‐ Oh! Asta! Oh, uh...

16:44.420 --> 16:47.423
Children, this is not
an earthquake drill.

16:47.423 --> 16:51.177
Now come out
for Mr Collins' presentation.

16:51.177 --> 16:54.555
Hang on, sir, I just need
to make a few, er ‐‐

16:54.555 --> 16:56.390
Minor adjustments!

17:14.408 --> 17:15.743
(Panting)

17:19.664 --> 17:21.791
OK.
Straight to Miss Jones' lab!

17:39.517 --> 17:41.185
(Cries)

17:45.856 --> 17:48.484
‐ (Flushing)
‐ Aaah!

17:53.030 --> 17:55.575
ANDY: I hope Liv's
large and in charge!

17:55.575 --> 17:58.703
She's pretty good at handling
herself. Kind of like me.

17:58.703 --> 18:01.205
Nobody will see us here!

18:02.873 --> 18:05.167
Let's go, Ghost Force!

18:05.167 --> 18:07.336
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

18:12.383 --> 18:13.509
Fury!

18:14.719 --> 18:16.262
Krush!

18:18.347 --> 18:19.599
Ghost Force!

18:22.393 --> 18:23.936
Whoa!

18:26.647 --> 18:29.108
FURY:
You've got to be kidding me!

18:30.651 --> 18:33.571
I was bringing this to Mike.
When I got to the library

18:33.571 --> 18:34.947
everyone were gone!

18:34.947 --> 18:36.949
I left them alone
for five minutes

18:36.949 --> 18:38.993
and they got gobbled by a ghost!

18:38.993 --> 18:43.623
Calm down, Liv! It must be
a ghost with the munchies!

18:43.623 --> 18:45.541
Nothing we can't handle!
Oh, no! Not him!

18:47.084 --> 18:49.545
<i>Miss Jones!</i>
<i>We're in the library.</i>

18:49.545 --> 18:53.841
<i>‐ But we've been shrunk!</i>
‐ By a tiny ghost called Mikroo

18:53.841 --> 18:56.302
who fears anyone bigger than it.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.387
It should be
fairly easy to capture.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.056
<i>If we weren't tiny too!</i>

19:00.056 --> 19:02.558
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>and totally out of juice!</i>

19:02.558 --> 19:05.144
Of course!
It's one of Mikroo's powers.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.396
Not only
can he miniaturize things,

19:07.396 --> 19:10.691
he can drain the energy
out of any ghost he encounters.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.655
Wait! what if we made
a boo‐power battery

19:15.655 --> 19:18.783
‐ to recharge Andy and Mike?
‐ Brilliant idea, Miss Jones!

19:21.327 --> 19:22.662
OK. Here we go.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.831
Taking into account their size,
this should be enough

19:25.831 --> 19:27.875
to recharge both our boys!

19:37.718 --> 19:41.639
Amazing! We just found a way to
recharge our boo energy faster!

19:41.639 --> 19:44.809
Not really. This boo power
battery is way too small

19:44.809 --> 19:47.561
to recharge one of you
at your normal size.

19:47.561 --> 19:49.814
Hang in there, guys!
I'm coming!

19:54.485 --> 19:55.778
Boo, boo.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.323
(Barking)

20:03.452 --> 20:07.248
Oh! I stand corrected,
it <i>is</i> an earthquake!

20:10.251 --> 20:12.253
Uh‐oh! Aaah!

20:13.421 --> 20:14.714
‐ Whoa!
‐ Gotcha!

20:15.423 --> 20:18.217
‐ Thanks, bud! That was close!
‐ See?

20:18.217 --> 20:20.469
Even big guys like you
need a hand sometimes!

20:22.263 --> 20:24.014
(Barking)

20:30.771 --> 20:32.732
Oh, no! He's switching
to booster mode!

20:33.899 --> 20:35.735
‐ Boo!
‐ Aaah!

20:40.531 --> 20:41.782
What on Earth... ?

20:44.452 --> 20:47.204
Krush? Fury?

20:47.496 --> 20:49.206
Myst! Over Here!

20:50.583 --> 20:51.459
Here! Catch!

20:51.459 --> 20:53.169
Aaah!

20:54.378 --> 20:55.796
‐ Oh!
‐ Got you!

20:57.339 --> 20:57.965
Oh, no!

21:00.801 --> 21:02.762
Boo!

21:02.762 --> 21:05.931
Get him! Let's bring
that ghost down to size!

21:16.233 --> 21:18.652
‐ Time for boo‐fight!
‐ KRUSH: Hold up!

21:18.652 --> 21:20.237
Trust me. I got a plan!

21:20.237 --> 21:22.114
I need you to distract
this ghost!

21:25.242 --> 21:27.703
Miss Jones,
it's a fearful ghost, right?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.079
FURY: Hey! Big ball!

21:32.416 --> 21:33.626
Over here!

21:38.714 --> 21:40.508
‐ Boo?
‐ Flexy power!

21:41.258 --> 21:42.343
Oh!

21:43.385 --> 21:44.762
Uh‐oh!

21:44.762 --> 21:47.181
Whoa!

21:47.181 --> 21:48.724
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

21:59.652 --> 22:01.445
Boo!

22:02.822 --> 22:04.073
Huh?

22:08.619 --> 22:10.746
‐ Huh?
‐ Grr!

22:12.790 --> 22:13.749
Over to you, Ms Jones!

22:14.416 --> 22:15.876
Give Mikroo
the fright of its life!

22:15.876 --> 22:17.962
Let's pump it up!

22:18.546 --> 22:22.383
‐ Now!
‐ <i>Roar!</i>

22:22.383 --> 22:24.718
‐ Aaah!
‐ FURY: Party's over, Mikroo!

22:24.718 --> 22:25.594
Your turn, Krush!

22:29.557 --> 22:30.766
Grow max!

22:48.534 --> 22:49.910
Boo!

22:51.453 --> 22:53.247
Aaah!

23:02.464 --> 23:03.674
‐ Ow!
‐ Hey!

23:04.258 --> 23:06.176
Oh! These earthquakes
are getting out of hand!

23:08.304 --> 23:09.013
Boo‐ya!

23:13.601 --> 23:17.062
After that weird day, I need you
to do my homework tomorrow.

23:17.062 --> 23:20.399
‐ You got that?
‐ Yeah, not gonna happen.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.569
I don't think you get it,
Junior. I call the shots.

23:23.569 --> 23:26.989
Careful what you say. This is
going straight to voice memo.

23:26.989 --> 23:28.699
All I gotta do is press send

23:28.699 --> 23:31.493
and your threat
goes straight to the principal.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.746
Lemme do the math,
weeks of detention

23:33.746 --> 23:35.748
means zero basketball, correct?

23:37.666 --> 23:40.085
Pff... Whatever! Yo, Bobby!

23:41.795 --> 23:45.466
OK, maybe you can
handle yourself!

23:45.466 --> 23:48.552
I wasn't even recording.
My battery's totally dead!

23:48.552 --> 23:58.562
(Laughter)
