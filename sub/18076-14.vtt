NARRATOR: In 1972, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a miIitary court...

01:14.138 --> 01:15.549

01:15.640 --> 01:18.676

l'm sorry about that, Colonel,
but l didn't have much choice.

05:35.191 --> 05:36.602
My port engine gave out on me...

I'II put this as dipIomaticaIIy as I can,
Mr. Hicks...

drug-running operation we ever saw.

12:44.287 --> 12:46.576

my uncle described him.

There were thousands of them.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.785
They landed, but who knows where?
They could be here.

31:38.880 --> 31:42.130
They could be right here.
Please, don't make me, please.

31:45.261 --> 31:46.921
CORLlSS: Who is this guy?
DALTON: His doctor.

31:47.013 --> 31:48.756
Needed him to get out of the hospital.

31:48.848 --> 31:50.011
Figured he could help out...

31:59.901 --> 32:01.525

B.A.: Move? Are you crazy?

33:47.175 --> 33:50.259
No. A bunch of Venezuelan FederaIes
crossed the border line.

33:50.345 --> 33:53.262
They're headed this way.
We can't let them find the cocaine.

33:53.348 --> 33:54.925

-We're gonna have to move it.
