WEBVTT

02:31.130 --> 02:33.758
2306.

02:37.511 --> 02:39.597
Hello, honey.
How you doing?

02:39.680 --> 02:43.559
Good.
What did he say?

02:43.643 --> 02:48.189
Uh-huh. Is he still there?
How long ago did he leave?

02:48.272 --> 02:52.151
Uh-huh. I'm stopping here,
then I got a little meeting,

02:52.234 --> 02:54.862
and then I'll--
I would if I could.

02:54.946 --> 02:58.074
As soon as I can.
Let me get off and I--

02:58.157 --> 03:02.370
let me get off and I prom--
I promise you it'll be okay.

03:04.163 --> 03:08.250
A bunch of bullshit.
Waste a good man's time.

03:15.549 --> 03:18.511
Hi, could I speak
to Dr. Lowenstein, please?

03:18.594 --> 03:21.222
It's rather important.
Could you get him for me?

03:21.305 --> 03:23.975
Bunch of bullshit trying to make
a living on these deadbeat leads.

03:24.058 --> 03:26.519
I swear to God, Shel,
I'm on a sit today--

03:26.560 --> 03:29.772
Hello, Mrs. Swoboda,
this is Dave Moss.

03:29.855 --> 03:31.857
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

03:31.941 --> 03:35.695
Now on the Rio Rancho Estates,
we've had a situation just come up.

03:35.778 --> 03:38.364
The president of our company
is in town just one day,

03:38.447 --> 03:40.741
- and he has certain parcels--
- Doctor--

03:40.825 --> 03:43.828
well, could you get--
what do you mean?

03:43.911 --> 03:46.622
He's not there?
I have to speak to him.

03:46.706 --> 03:50.668
Yes, it is fairly urgent.
Mr. Levene.

03:50.710 --> 03:54.964
No, I can't be reached.
I'll get back to him.

03:55.047 --> 03:57.258
He has certain parcels--
certain choice parcels

03:57.341 --> 03:59.802
which he's given me
a hold on for the next 48 hours.

03:59.927 --> 04:02.888
What would be the best time to get
you and your husband together?

04:02.930 --> 04:07.935
Say, tonight, at 10:00,
or tomorrow at 8:00?

04:07.977 --> 04:10.479
Okay.

04:10.563 --> 04:13.149
Okay, what would be
the best time to do that?

04:15.067 --> 04:18.529
Look, you sent in the--
no, no, listen to me now--

04:18.571 --> 04:21.324
I've got 48 hours
to make you a lot of money.

04:22.783 --> 04:27.038
Well, when will he be home?
Fine, I'll call you back in 10 minutes.

04:28.664 --> 04:31.292
They don't give you the leads,
they don't give you the support,

04:31.375 --> 04:33.210
- they don't give you dick.
- Yeah.

04:33.252 --> 04:35.254
Then they're yanking us in
on some sales conference.

04:35.296 --> 04:38.424
When's the last time anybody
learned a goddamn thing?

04:38.466 --> 04:40.885
All it does is some jerk
shoots his mouth off.

04:42.595 --> 04:45.973
I swear to God, Shel, I got half a mind
to go across the street.

04:46.057 --> 04:48.559
I got half a mind to go
with you if they'd take me.

04:48.601 --> 04:52.772
You never know-- I was talking
to Jerry Graff last week.

04:54.440 --> 04:57.026
I got to call
these deadbeats back.

04:58.110 --> 05:00.321
I can't make a goddamn
dollar with these leads,

05:00.363 --> 05:02.239
and you're killing my ass
on the street.

05:02.281 --> 05:04.617
- I'm sorry you aren't happy here.
- That's cute,

05:04.700 --> 05:07.203
but you're running this office
like a bunch of bullshit.

05:07.286 --> 05:09.413
You're on an override--
you make money, we make money.

05:09.455 --> 05:12.500
- I'd like you to make more money.
- Then don't go waste my time.

05:12.541 --> 05:15.252
- A sales conference?
- The strategy comes from downtown.

05:15.294 --> 05:17.588
Oh, the strategy?
The strategy?

05:17.672 --> 05:19.715
- Well, I think I'll pass.
- I wouldn't.

05:19.799 --> 05:22.635
- Why is that?
- When you come, then you'll see.

05:22.718 --> 05:25.763
- Shelly.
- John.

05:25.846 --> 05:27.890
Are you ready
to do or die tonight?

05:27.932 --> 05:29.892
Oh yeah,
always ready, John.

05:29.934 --> 05:32.270
Always ready, John.
Now, one thing--

05:32.353 --> 05:34.313
we were talking about the leads.
We got some new ones?

05:34.397 --> 05:36.649
That's what we're going
to talk about at the meeting.

05:36.732 --> 05:39.151
We are? Because I'm running
into a bit of a snag.

05:39.235 --> 05:40.987
Yes, I've seen
your sales figures.

05:41.070 --> 05:43.114
That's the leads.
You give me a better lead--

05:43.197 --> 05:45.241
That's what we're going
to be talking about.

05:45.324 --> 05:47.118
I'm in a bind--
personal problems.

05:47.201 --> 05:48.995
- I could use a leg up.
- After the meeting.

05:49.036 --> 05:52.248
- I hear the new Glengarry leads--
- After the meeting, Shel.

05:52.290 --> 05:54.250
- Hey, Ricky.
- Hello, John.

05:54.292 --> 05:56.877
- Wet out there tonight.
- Huh?

05:56.961 --> 06:01.424
- Wet out there tonight.
- Uh-huh.

06:01.507 --> 06:03.676
- Maybe it'll break the heat.
- Yeah.

06:07.305 --> 06:10.516
Al, give me a quick J&B, huh?
Double.

06:10.600 --> 06:12.351
Cutty, Al.

06:15.438 --> 06:17.940
- They say...
- Huh?

06:18.024 --> 06:21.777
they say it was so hot
downtown this afternoon,

06:21.861 --> 06:26.365
grown men on the street corner
were going up to cops

06:26.449 --> 06:29.118
begging the cops
to shoot them.

06:29.702 --> 06:33.998
They say you should not drink
alcohol when it's so hot.

06:34.081 --> 06:38.336
- Who says that?
- Something I read.

06:38.419 --> 06:41.797
For they say
it dehydrates you.

06:41.881 --> 06:44.717
They say
you should drink water,

06:44.759 --> 06:48.929
but I subscribe to the law
of contrary public opinion.

06:49.889 --> 06:53.351
If everyone thinks one thing,
then I say bet the other way.

06:54.602 --> 06:56.562
Added to which,
you know they're wrong.

06:56.646 --> 06:59.106
That's what I'm saying.

07:02.735 --> 07:05.738
- Slow tonight.
- Oh, yeah.

07:05.821 --> 07:07.907
Well, I guess
everybody's staying home.

07:07.990 --> 07:10.284
If my daughter calls,
anybody calls,

07:10.368 --> 07:13.913
I'm over at the office.
Thanks.

07:46.612 --> 07:49.323
I had a woman
in White Plains on the hook--

07:49.407 --> 07:52.368
five units, Mountain View--
what happens?

07:52.410 --> 07:54.245
She has to check
with her lawyer.

07:54.328 --> 07:56.872
- You let her check with her lawyer?
- What could I do?

07:56.956 --> 07:59.500
- I dunno.
- Shelly.

07:59.583 --> 08:01.669
- Huh?
- Who's the guy?

08:01.752 --> 08:03.671
Couldn't tell you.

08:03.754 --> 08:07.425
I don't like the whole thing,
because all I need is a lead.

08:07.508 --> 08:09.218
- They won't give out--
- Uh-huh.

08:09.302 --> 08:11.887
The rich get richer,
that's the law of the land.

08:11.971 --> 08:14.140
Who belongs
to the BM--?

08:19.395 --> 08:21.272
It is 7:30.

08:21.314 --> 08:23.482
So who is that?

08:24.567 --> 08:26.485
And where is
Mr. Roma?

08:26.569 --> 08:28.237
Well, I'm not a leash,
so I don't know, do I?

08:29.363 --> 08:33.367
Let me have
your attention for a moment.

08:33.451 --> 08:36.662
You're talking about what?
You're talking about--

08:38.039 --> 08:40.082
bitching about
that sale you shot,

08:40.166 --> 08:42.376
some son of a bitch
don't want to buy land,

08:42.460 --> 08:43.794
somebody don't want
what you're selling,

08:43.836 --> 08:45.796
some broad you're
trying to screw, so forth.

08:45.838 --> 08:47.923
Let's talk
about something important.

08:48.007 --> 08:49.634
- Are they all here?
- All but one.

08:49.675 --> 08:50.676
I'm going anyway.

08:50.718 --> 08:54.263
Let's talk
about something important.

08:54.347 --> 08:56.724
Put that coffee down.

09:01.312 --> 09:04.315
Coffee's for closers only.

09:06.734 --> 09:09.195
You think
I'm fucking with you?

09:12.698 --> 09:14.492
I am not fucking with you.

09:15.201 --> 09:17.411
I'm here from downtown.

09:17.495 --> 09:19.038
I'm here
from Mitch and Murray.

09:19.121 --> 09:22.249
And I'm here
on a mission of mercy.

09:26.170 --> 09:29.632
- Your name's Levene?
- Yeah.

09:29.715 --> 09:33.511
You call yourself a salesman,
you son of a bitch?

09:33.594 --> 09:35.304
I don't got to listen
to this shit.

09:35.388 --> 09:38.641
You certainly don't, 'cause
the good news is, you're fired.

09:40.434 --> 09:43.187
The bad news is you've got--
all of you've got--

09:43.271 --> 09:45.273
just one week
to regain your jobs,

09:45.356 --> 09:48.818
starting with tonight--
starting with tonight's sit.

09:51.362 --> 09:54.699
Oh, have I got
your attention now?

09:57.451 --> 09:58.619
Good...

10:00.204 --> 10:01.789
'cause we're adding
a little something

10:01.872 --> 10:03.499
to this month's
sales contest.

10:03.582 --> 10:06.669
As you all know, first prize
is a Cadillac Eldorado.

10:06.711 --> 10:08.754
Anybody want to see
second prize?

10:08.838 --> 10:12.258
Second prize is
a set of steak knives.

10:14.802 --> 10:17.138
Third prize is you're fired.

10:20.891 --> 10:24.562
Do you get the picture?
Are you laughing now?

10:24.645 --> 10:29.066
You got leads. Mitch and Murray
paid good money.

10:29.108 --> 10:31.277
Get their names
to sell them.

10:31.360 --> 10:33.362
You can't close
the leads you're given,

10:33.446 --> 10:36.115
you can't close shit,
you are shit!

10:36.198 --> 10:39.702
Hit the bricks, pal, and beat it,
'cause you are going out!

10:39.785 --> 10:43.247
- The leads are weak.
- The leads are weak?

10:43.331 --> 10:46.042
The fucking leads are weak?
You're weak.

10:46.125 --> 10:48.085
I've been
in this business 15 years.

10:48.169 --> 10:50.463
- What's your name?
- Fuck you--

10:50.546 --> 10:53.049
that's my name!
You know why, mister?

10:53.132 --> 10:55.259
Because you drove a Hyundai
to get here tonight,

10:55.343 --> 11:00.264
I drove an $80,000 BMW.
That's my name.

11:04.477 --> 11:07.563
And your name
is "You're wanting."

11:07.647 --> 11:10.816
You can't play in the man's game?
You can't close them?

11:10.900 --> 11:14.278
Then go home and tell your wife
your troubles.

11:15.321 --> 11:18.032
Because only one thing
counts in this life--

11:18.115 --> 11:21.494
get them to sign
on the line which is dotted!

11:21.577 --> 11:24.497
You hear me,
you fucking faggots?

11:31.754 --> 11:34.173
"A-B-C."

11:34.256 --> 11:37.218
A-- Always,
B-- Be, C-- Closing.

11:37.301 --> 11:39.261
Always Be Closing.

11:39.303 --> 11:42.974
"Always Be Closing."

11:43.933 --> 11:45.726
"A-I-D-A."

11:45.768 --> 11:48.479
"Attention, Interest,
Decision, Action."

11:48.562 --> 11:51.023
Attention--
Do I have your attention?

11:51.107 --> 11:53.234
Interest--
Are you interested?

11:53.317 --> 11:55.611
I know you are,
because it's fuck or walk.

11:55.653 --> 11:57.655
You close
or you hit the bricks.

11:57.738 --> 12:01.951
Decision-- Have you made
your decision for Christ?

12:02.034 --> 12:06.706
And Action.
"A-I-D-A."

12:06.789 --> 12:09.083
Get out there--
you got the prospects coming in.

12:09.166 --> 12:11.294
You think they came in
to get out of the rain?

12:11.377 --> 12:13.796
A guy don't walk on the lot
lest he wants to buy.

12:13.838 --> 12:17.133
They're sitting out there
waiting to give you their money.

12:17.216 --> 12:19.260
Are you gonna take it?

12:19.343 --> 12:22.471
Are you man enough
to take it?

12:29.312 --> 12:30.896
Crap.

12:30.980 --> 12:32.857
What's the problem, pal?
You-- Moss.

12:32.940 --> 12:35.401
You're such a hero,
you're so rich,

12:35.484 --> 12:38.738
how come you're here wasting
your time with a bunch of bums?

12:40.990 --> 12:43.367
You see this watch?

12:46.037 --> 12:49.790
- You see this watch?
- Yeah.

12:49.874 --> 12:53.044
That watch costs
more than your car.

12:53.127 --> 12:57.173
I made $70,000 last year.
How much you make?

12:59.216 --> 13:04.597
You see, pal... that's who I am,
and you're nothing.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.559
Nice guy?
I don't give a shit.

13:08.601 --> 13:12.605
Good father? Fuck you--
go home and play with your kids.

13:12.688 --> 13:17.151
You want to work here--
close!

13:17.234 --> 13:20.488
You think this is abuse?

13:20.571 --> 13:22.657
You think this is abuse,
you cocksucker?

13:22.698 --> 13:26.369
You can't take this, how can you
take the abuse you get on a sit?

13:27.453 --> 13:30.957
You don't like it, leave.

13:32.917 --> 13:36.337
I can go out there tonight--
the materials you got--

13:36.379 --> 13:40.508
make myself $15,000.
Tonight-- in two hours!

13:40.549 --> 13:42.385
Can you?

13:43.469 --> 13:46.180
Can you?

13:47.598 --> 13:51.143
Go and do likewise.
"A-I-D-A."

13:51.227 --> 13:53.813
Get mad, you son of a bitches.
Get mad!

13:53.896 --> 13:57.817
You know what it takes
to sell real estate?

13:57.900 --> 14:01.570
It takes brass balls
to sell real estate.

14:06.242 --> 14:08.911
Go and do likewise,
gents.

14:08.995 --> 14:11.414
The money's out there--
you pick it up, it's yours,

14:11.455 --> 14:13.749
you don't,
I got no sympathy for you.

14:13.833 --> 14:15.668
You want to go out
on those sits tonight and close--

14:15.751 --> 14:17.461
close-- it's yours.

14:17.545 --> 14:19.714
Not, you're gonna be
shining my shoes.

14:19.755 --> 14:22.508
And you know
what you'll be saying.

14:22.591 --> 14:25.219
Bunch of losers
sitting around in a bar,

14:25.303 --> 14:29.432
"Oh yeah, I used to be a salesman.
It's a tough racket."

14:38.149 --> 14:40.568
These are the new leads.

14:40.651 --> 14:43.696
These are
the Glengarry leads.

14:43.779 --> 14:48.451
And to you, they're gold.
And you don't get them.

14:48.534 --> 14:51.287
Why?

14:51.370 --> 14:55.374
Because to give them to you
is just throwing them away.

14:59.378 --> 15:01.839
They're for closers.

15:07.887 --> 15:09.138
I'd wish you good luck,

15:09.221 --> 15:11.432
but you wouldn't know what
to do with it if you got it.

15:16.020 --> 15:20.608
And to answer your question, pal--
"Why am I here?"

15:20.691 --> 15:23.653
I came here because
Mitch and Murray asked me to.

15:23.736 --> 15:26.447
They asked me for a favor.
I said, "The real favor--

15:26.489 --> 15:29.492
follow my advice
and fire your fucking ass,

15:29.575 --> 15:32.078
because a loser
is a loser."

15:43.673 --> 15:45.675
Bunch of fucking nonsense--

15:45.758 --> 15:48.469
treat people like that.

15:50.179 --> 15:53.182
The fuck is he going
to get off?

15:53.266 --> 15:56.644
- Mickey Mouse sales conference.
- He didn't mean it.

15:56.686 --> 15:59.563
I'm sure he didn't mean it about
trimming down the sales quota.

15:59.647 --> 16:01.816
Where is Roma?
Where the hell is Mr. Ricky Roma?

16:01.899 --> 16:04.277
All the while we got to sit here,
eat this nonsense?

16:04.360 --> 16:07.488
Hello? Mr. Levene.
How's she doing?

16:07.530 --> 16:09.532
Uh-huh, yeah.
Is she awake?

16:09.615 --> 16:12.159
Oh, the doctor came by.
What did he say?

16:12.201 --> 16:15.788
Uh-huh.
I can't come in tonight.

16:15.871 --> 16:18.624
I think-- I know she is.
I know that she is.

16:18.708 --> 16:22.545
I've gotta go out. Will you please
tell her when she wakes?

16:22.628 --> 16:26.590
I've got to go out.
Tell her I'll call her from the road.

16:26.674 --> 16:28.259
Thank you.

16:30.553 --> 16:33.681
Gentlemen,
you heard the man.

16:33.723 --> 16:35.516
What is this in aid of?

16:35.600 --> 16:37.685
- As of tonight--
- What is this? Excuse me.

16:37.768 --> 16:39.937
What it's in aid of
is that Mitch and Murray--

16:40.021 --> 16:42.732
Fuck Mitch and Murray!
I'm doing my job,

16:42.815 --> 16:44.609
I got to put up
with this childishness?

16:44.692 --> 16:46.569
I don't make the rules.
I'm paid to run the office.

16:46.611 --> 16:48.988
You don't like the rules, Dave?
There's the door!

16:50.990 --> 16:55.494
Two lead cards for tonight,
two lead cards for tomorrow.

16:55.578 --> 16:57.288
As you heard,
end of the month,

16:57.371 --> 16:59.457
top salesman on the board
gets the Eldorado.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.667
- Next man down the--
- What about the good leads?

17:01.751 --> 17:04.128
- The leads I've given you.
- But these leads are shit.

17:04.211 --> 17:06.047
They're old--
I've seen that name 100 times.

17:06.088 --> 17:09.216
- The leads are assigned randomly.
- What about the new leads?

17:09.300 --> 17:11.093
The new leads--
the Glengarry leads.

17:11.177 --> 17:13.512
I've got them.
I'm going to hang onto them.

17:13.596 --> 17:15.681
And they'll be
assigned to closers,

17:15.765 --> 17:18.100
based on the sales volume,
first to Roma.

17:18.184 --> 17:20.102
- Where is Roma?
- Don't worry about Roma.

17:20.186 --> 17:21.812
He'll get his leads,
you've got yours.

17:21.896 --> 17:24.023
He's top name on the board,
so he don't have to be here?

17:24.106 --> 17:26.567
That's correct!
And as the hour is waning,

17:26.651 --> 17:29.487
I suggest you-- those of you
who are interested

17:29.570 --> 17:32.365
in a continuing job with
this organization, get to work.

17:32.448 --> 17:34.450
That's garbage.
Bullshit.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.243
- Thank you for your attention.
- Bullshit!

17:36.285 --> 17:40.414
How am I supposed to close these?
Look at this.

17:40.498 --> 17:43.459
I've had this guy before.
I've been to his house twice.

17:43.542 --> 17:47.254
I-- I can't--
I can't close this stuff.

17:50.091 --> 17:53.010
Shelly, how am I
supposed to--

17:53.094 --> 17:55.763
They're going
to bounce me out of a job.

18:03.771 --> 18:07.358
Hello, Mr. Palermo?
I'm sorry.

18:07.441 --> 18:10.820
Mr. Speice?
Mr. Robert Speice?

18:10.861 --> 18:13.823
Yeah,
this is George Aaronow.

18:13.906 --> 18:16.993
I'm with Rio.
I spoke with your wife earlier.

18:17.076 --> 18:20.621
I'm the vice president of Rio Rancho
Properties in Furman, Arizona.

18:20.663 --> 18:25.918
Yes. I'm calling from the airport,
and consulting my map,

18:26.002 --> 18:28.212
I see that you and your wife
live near the airport.

18:28.296 --> 18:31.299
I have some rather--
rather unusual,

18:31.382 --> 18:33.634
rather good information
on the property...

18:33.676 --> 18:38.097
Hello? Hello, this is
Sheldon Levene.

18:37.888 --> 18:40.516
Please listen closely--
I only have a moment or so.

18:40.558 --> 18:44.186
I can speak only
to a Mrs. Nyborg.

18:44.228 --> 18:48.190
Oh, this is Mrs. Nyborg.
Please listen closely, Mrs. Nyborg.

18:48.274 --> 18:51.986
I'm calling from Consolidated
Properties of Arizona.

18:52.069 --> 18:55.781
Our computer has chosen you
from all of the many thousands

18:55.865 --> 18:58.701
who write in requesting
information on our properties.

18:58.743 --> 19:01.746
Now by federal law,
as you probably know,

19:01.829 --> 19:04.999
the prize must be awarded to you
even if you are not engaged

19:05.082 --> 19:07.084
in our land
development plan.

19:07.168 --> 19:10.796
The only stipulation, of course,
is that you and your husband

19:10.880 --> 19:14.008
must sign at the same time
for the receipt of your prize.

19:14.091 --> 19:18.512
Now, I will be in the area
tonight, possibly tomorrow.

19:18.554 --> 19:21.140
What do you think might be
a convenient time to meet

19:21.223 --> 19:23.351
with both you
and your husband?

19:23.392 --> 19:26.020
Of course I'll hold.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.869
- Bunch of fucking nonsense, huh?
- I can't close them.

19:41.953 --> 19:43.454
- Nobody can close 'em.
- They're old.

19:43.579 --> 19:45.748
They're ancient--
a bunch of fucking nonsense.

19:45.831 --> 19:48.125
Get some jerk
to come in here--

19:48.209 --> 19:51.003
Sometimes I think,
"I wonder if I belong in this business."

19:51.087 --> 19:53.464
Send a guy out there--
no support, no confidence.

19:53.506 --> 19:56.175
Then I say,
"Nobody can close 'em."

19:56.259 --> 19:58.761
- Then I look at Roma.
- Roma-- fuck Roma.

19:58.844 --> 20:00.930
Had a freak--
a little run of luck.

20:00.972 --> 20:03.432
The leads are garbage.

20:03.474 --> 20:05.601
Then I say,
"Why give him the good leads?

20:05.643 --> 20:07.770
- He doesn't need 'em."
- You going out?

20:07.853 --> 20:12.441
Yeah. I have to go out.
I can't make a sit.

20:12.525 --> 20:16.445
- Have you tried?
- Yeah. Something's wrong with me.

20:16.487 --> 20:18.489
What is it?
I can't push through.

20:18.531 --> 20:20.783
Get your coat on.
You're coming out with me.

20:20.825 --> 20:22.952
- Something in me.
- Forget it.

20:22.994 --> 20:26.080
- I try, I try.
- I said forget it, come on.

20:26.163 --> 20:28.416
I can't close 'em.

20:32.003 --> 20:33.671
Life.

20:33.754 --> 20:35.965
I swear to God,
you work all your life--

20:36.048 --> 20:40.136
- Forget it, George.
- Roma, so on...

20:40.219 --> 20:42.638
- so gifted.
- Gifted, my ass!

20:42.680 --> 20:46.267
- The guy gets a string of luck.
- No, no, no.

20:46.350 --> 20:48.019
The thing of it is,
money's tight.

20:48.102 --> 20:49.979
When times are tight,
it don't do no good

20:50.021 --> 20:52.398
to throw around,
"Just go out and sell."

20:52.481 --> 20:55.192
Threaten a man all you want,
you can't whip a dead horse.

20:55.276 --> 20:56.819
- Nope.
- All this garbage--

20:56.861 --> 20:58.362
"Sell 10,000,
you win a Cadillac;

20:58.446 --> 21:01.699
you lose, we're gonna fire
your ass"? It's medieval.

21:01.782 --> 21:02.950
- Yes.
- It's wrong.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.493
- Yes.
- Yes it is,

21:04.577 --> 21:06.120
and you know
who's responsible?

21:06.162 --> 21:08.164
- Who?
- You know who it is.

21:08.164 --> 21:10.124
It's Mitch and Murray,
'cause it don't have to be this way.

21:10.166 --> 21:12.209
- No.
- Look at Jerry Graff.

21:12.251 --> 21:14.295
He's clean, he's doing
business for himself,

21:14.337 --> 21:16.505
he's got that list--
with the nurses?

21:16.464 --> 21:21.010
You see? That's thinking.
Why take a 10% sales commission?

21:21.427 --> 21:24.305
Why are we giving the rest away?
What are we giving 90% for?

21:24.639 --> 21:27.266
For nothing.
For some jerk in the office,

21:27.350 --> 21:29.685
telling us, "Get out there and close,
go win a Cadillac."

21:29.727 --> 21:32.355
Graff goes out and buys.
He pays top dollar.

21:32.438 --> 21:33.856
- You see?
- Yes.

21:33.940 --> 21:36.901
For the leads-- that's thinking.
Now, he's got the leads,

21:36.984 --> 21:41.155
he goes in business for himself.
That's what? That's thinking.

21:41.238 --> 21:43.199
Who-- who's got
a steady job,

21:43.240 --> 21:45.368
a regular job,
a couple of bucks nobody's touched?

21:45.451 --> 21:46.953
Nurses.

21:47.036 --> 21:48.663
Graff goes and buys
a fucking list of nurses. One grand--

21:48.704 --> 21:51.082
he paid two, I'll eat my hat.
4,000 or 5,000 nurses.

21:51.165 --> 21:53.542
- He's going wild.
- He is?

21:53.626 --> 21:56.837
- Yeah, he's doing very well.
- I heard they were running cold.

21:56.921 --> 21:58.714
- The nurses?
- Yeah.

21:58.798 --> 22:01.968
You hear a lot of things.
He's doing very well.

22:02.051 --> 22:03.886
- With River Oaks?
- River Oaks, Brook Farms.

22:03.970 --> 22:06.681
All that shit. Somebody told me--
you know what he's clearing, himself?

22:06.722 --> 22:09.517
- 14, 15 grand a week.
- Himself?

22:09.600 --> 22:12.937
That's what I'm saying.
Why? He's got the leads.

22:13.020 --> 22:16.107
He's got the good leads.
What are we?

22:16.148 --> 22:17.942
We're sitting
in the shit here. Why?

22:17.984 --> 22:19.860
Because we got to go to them
to get them.

22:19.944 --> 22:22.822
90% of our sales we're paying
to the office for the leads.

22:22.905 --> 22:26.325
There's our leads, there's overhead,
phones, a lot of stuff.

22:26.409 --> 22:28.369
What do you need?
A telephone?

22:28.452 --> 22:31.580
Some broad to say, "Good morning"?
Nothing. It's the leads.

22:31.956 --> 22:34.250
The whole thing is the leads,
you understand me?

22:34.333 --> 22:37.128
You can't sell to a void--
you got to get a goddamn person.

22:37.211 --> 22:39.755
You get a lead, you get
a person-- I'll go sell 'em.

22:39.839 --> 22:41.632
Otherwise, what do they want
from my life?

22:42.091 --> 22:45.720
Hello, Danny?
Dan, it's Shel Levene.

22:45.803 --> 22:48.848
Yeah, we spoke--
last May I called you.

22:48.931 --> 22:52.101
I was in town from my estate
in Rio Rancho, and--

22:52.184 --> 22:53.894
Arizona.

22:53.978 --> 22:56.230
I wish we could have
gotten together at that time.

22:56.272 --> 23:00.026
Danny, that piece of property I had
for you has increased in value--

23:00.109 --> 23:05.323
Grace, Grace,
what was that figure? $76,000.

23:05.406 --> 23:07.867
Oh, Danny, I wish you could have
been in on it with me.

23:07.908 --> 23:10.536
Look, I'm here overnight--
I have to go home tomorrow,

23:10.578 --> 23:14.457
and I thought, after the interest
you showed on the last trip, that--

23:14.540 --> 23:18.419
Hold it, Grace. Danny,
I know that you're serious,

23:18.461 --> 23:21.547
and because of that, I am going
to shove my appointments around

23:21.631 --> 23:25.676
and make sure--
oh, gee, I wish that--

23:27.094 --> 23:30.723
All right, Danny.
Yeah, all right.

23:41.359 --> 23:44.570
Going out tonight,
Shelly?

23:47.448 --> 23:50.409
What is this bullshit
with the sales promotion?

23:50.451 --> 23:51.953
It isn't bullshit.
It's the way it is.

23:52.036 --> 23:54.121
You're going to fire
the bottom men on the list?

23:54.205 --> 23:56.624
That's the way it is
and I don't make the rules.

23:56.666 --> 24:00.002
- The rules come from downtown.
- I got a problem here, John.

24:00.086 --> 24:02.588
- I'm closing up the office.
- Come have a drink with me.

24:02.630 --> 24:05.925
- I've got to get home.
- Do me the courtesy-- five minutes?

24:05.967 --> 24:08.135
I am trying to get home
for two hours.

24:08.219 --> 24:11.222
I got to go home, grab one hour
with my kids, come back here,

24:11.305 --> 24:13.766
see if any of you closed
a contract, take the contract--

24:13.849 --> 24:17.395
- How about one minute?
- What is it?

24:17.478 --> 24:19.522
- I can't close these leads.
- Then move on.

24:19.605 --> 24:23.484
Don't jump! Don't jump out
of your manager bag a second.

24:23.526 --> 24:27.780
It's just two guys talking,
am I right? We're just talking.

24:27.863 --> 24:30.449
You got the new leads.
If you would give me-- just hold on.

24:30.533 --> 24:33.286
The Glengarry leads are to be
assigned only to closers.

24:33.369 --> 24:36.122
Hold on a second.
If you give me the good leads--

24:36.163 --> 24:37.790
You blew the last good one
I gave you.

24:37.873 --> 24:39.542
No, no-- hold on,
will you?

24:39.625 --> 24:42.211
I did not blow 'em.
One kicked out. One, I closed.

24:42.295 --> 24:44.171
- You didn't close it.
- Would you listen to me?

24:44.255 --> 24:48.050
I closed that cocksucker!
His ex! John, his ex!

24:48.134 --> 24:50.595
I didn't even know he was married.
The judge invalidated it.

24:50.678 --> 24:51.596
Shelly--

24:51.637 --> 24:54.181
What was that job, huh?
Bad luck. That's all it was.

24:54.307 --> 24:56.434
I pray you never find it--
it runs in streaks.

24:56.517 --> 24:59.437
That's what it's doing,
that's all it does-- streaks.

24:59.520 --> 25:03.107
I pray that it misses you
and that's all I have to say.

25:03.190 --> 25:06.152
Shit, I've got to eat.
Williamson--

25:06.235 --> 25:10.364
look at the sheets.
Look at the sheets.

25:10.448 --> 25:14.160
1987, '88, '89--
six months in '89-- who's on top?

25:14.201 --> 25:15.703
- Roma.
- Under him?

25:15.703 --> 25:18.497
- Moss.
- Oh, bullshit, John!

25:18.581 --> 25:21.167
April to September it's me--
it's no fucking Moss.

25:21.250 --> 25:23.586
Due respect,
he's an order-taker.

25:23.669 --> 25:27.340
Talk-- talks a good game,
but look on the board, it's me.

25:27.423 --> 25:29.592
- Not lately it isn't.
- Not late--

25:30.384 --> 25:32.053
Well, lately--
kiss my ass "lately."

25:32.136 --> 25:34.805
You call Murray and you call Mitch--
when we were on Peterson,

25:34.889 --> 25:37.516
who do you think bought the new car?
Call Mitch. The Seville?

25:37.600 --> 25:40.686
He came in here--
"You bought that for me, fella."

25:40.770 --> 25:44.690
And out of what? Hey, look at me!
Out of what? Nothing!

25:44.732 --> 25:46.984
Cold calling.
You want to talk about a sale?

25:47.068 --> 25:49.570
You are really
beginning to burn my ass, kid.

25:49.654 --> 25:53.991
I can't get a lead, you--
it was skill, John.

25:54.075 --> 25:56.535
It could be working for you--
you want to throw it away.

25:56.577 --> 25:58.788
- It isn't me.
- It's not you--

25:58.871 --> 26:01.374
I wonder who it is.
Who the fuck am I talking to?

26:01.457 --> 26:05.211
- I need the leads to sell.
- After the contest. After the 30th.

26:05.294 --> 26:07.546
Bullshit,
"After the contest."

26:07.588 --> 26:10.299
If I'm not on that board by the 30th,
they're going to can my ass.

26:13.511 --> 26:17.098
I need those leads
and I need 'em now or I'm out.

26:21.769 --> 26:28.025
You're going to miss me.
I swear to you, you will miss me.

26:28.109 --> 26:29.860
Let me tell you
something, Shelly.

26:29.944 --> 26:32.947
I do what I'm hired to do--
you might do the same.

26:33.030 --> 26:34.907
- Jesus.
- Now wait a second!

26:36.534 --> 26:40.454
I'm hired to watch the leads,
to marshal my sales force.

26:40.496 --> 26:42.623
I'm given a policy.
My job is to do that.

26:42.707 --> 26:44.750
Marshal your sales force?

26:44.834 --> 26:47.503
Anybody falls below
a certain mark, I'm directed.

26:47.586 --> 26:49.547
I'm not permitted
to give them the premium leads.

26:49.630 --> 26:53.551
How do they rise
above that mark? With dreck?

26:53.593 --> 26:55.928
With this toilet paper
you're giving me?

26:56.012 --> 26:57.597
You give me
one premium lead--

26:57.680 --> 26:59.390
Do you know what
the premium leads cost?

26:59.432 --> 27:01.726
Do I know what
the premium leads cost?

27:01.767 --> 27:03.227
Yeah,
I know what they cost.

27:03.269 --> 27:06.522
I generated the sufficient
dollar revenue to buy them.

27:06.606 --> 27:09.567
But I cannot sell shit!

27:09.650 --> 27:12.236
Jesus. And I've seen
these before, you know.

27:12.278 --> 27:14.238
Christ, I saw these back--
Homestead--

27:14.280 --> 27:16.616
1985, we pitched
these cocksuckers Baywater.

27:16.699 --> 27:20.995
They couldn't buy a fucking toaster.
They're broke. They're deadbeats.

27:21.078 --> 27:23.998
Just give me some leads that don't
come out of a phone book.

27:24.081 --> 27:26.751
You give me something hotter
than that and I can close it.

27:26.834 --> 27:29.086
It's just a streak.
I'm gonna turn it around.

27:29.170 --> 27:32.423
Hey, I need your help.

27:34.550 --> 27:37.386
I can't do it,
Shelly.

27:42.725 --> 27:44.936
John...

27:45.019 --> 27:47.647
I'll give you 10%.

27:47.730 --> 27:50.316
- Of what?
- My end-- what I close.

27:50.358 --> 27:53.319
You give me the premium leads,
you're in for 10%, what I close.

27:53.361 --> 27:55.237
- And what if you don't close?
- I will.

27:55.321 --> 27:57.323
- What if you don't close?
- I will close.

27:57.406 --> 27:59.492
What if you don't,
you understand?

27:59.575 --> 28:02.495
Then I'm fucked. You think you're
the only guy with a family?

28:02.536 --> 28:04.288
- You see what I'm saying?
- John--

28:04.372 --> 28:06.624
I step out and you don't close,
then it's my job.

28:06.707 --> 28:08.668
- Then I'm fucked.
- I will close!

28:08.709 --> 28:11.462
Now, 10%John--
I can get hot, you know that.

28:11.545 --> 28:14.090
- Not lately you can't.
- That's defeatist-- fuck it!

28:14.173 --> 28:17.093
Go with me. Get on my side
and let's do something.

28:17.176 --> 28:19.845
You want to run this office?
You heard what the man said--

28:19.887 --> 28:22.348
"Attack."
Let's do something.

28:22.390 --> 28:26.811
- Huh?
- 20%.

28:28.229 --> 28:30.856
- All right.
- And 50 bucks a lead.

28:30.898 --> 28:32.900
- No?
- Oh!

28:39.782 --> 28:41.534
Oh, shit.

28:54.964 --> 28:59.260
Listen...
I got to talk to you.

28:59.343 --> 29:04.223
Permit me to do this a second.
I'm older than you.

29:04.265 --> 29:07.602
A man acquires a reputation
on the street.

29:07.685 --> 29:10.396
What he does when he's up,
what he does at other times...

29:10.479 --> 29:13.691
I said, "10," you said, "No."
You said, "20," I said, "Fine."

29:13.733 --> 29:17.153
Now you want to throw
this 50-buck thing in.

29:17.236 --> 29:22.074
John, a good deal-- has got to be
one where both parties--

29:22.158 --> 29:25.369
Okay, okay, okay, fine--
20%, 50 bucks a lead. It's done.

29:25.453 --> 29:27.371
Let's go out.
We make some money.

29:27.413 --> 29:30.041
I got bills to pay.
I want two sits tonight

29:30.124 --> 29:32.793
and I want the good leads--
the Glengarry leads-- two.

29:32.877 --> 29:35.046
Two, John, because
I am going to close 'em both.

29:35.129 --> 29:37.924
It's a long road
with no turning, pally.

29:38.007 --> 29:40.885
Huh? Okay.
Now, let's go.

29:40.927 --> 29:43.554
I've got to go back
to the office to get 'em.

29:43.596 --> 29:47.516
Go on, let's go.
This is what I was saying, John.

29:47.600 --> 29:50.269
All you need, a little boost,
you turn a streak around.

29:50.353 --> 29:53.397
Am I right? Good, huh?
Huh, good?

29:53.439 --> 29:55.900
What?

29:55.942 --> 29:58.736
- What?
- Two leads, 100 bucks.

29:58.778 --> 30:00.905
- Now?
- Now, yes. When?

30:00.947 --> 30:03.240
- Shit, John.
- I wish I could.

30:03.324 --> 30:05.993
You fucking asshole.

30:06.077 --> 30:09.372
I don't have it--
I don't--

30:09.455 --> 30:11.791
I'll bring it in the office
in the morning.

30:11.832 --> 30:14.251
- I'll be coming with the sales.
- Nope.

30:16.671 --> 30:19.382
I can't fucking
believe this.

30:19.465 --> 30:22.802
All right, here's...

30:22.843 --> 30:24.679
20... 30, and--

30:24.762 --> 30:28.307
Jesus, here's the 30.
I'll bring the rest in tomorrow.

30:28.391 --> 30:30.601
We got to do this, huh, pal?
For Christ's sake!

30:30.685 --> 30:32.478
No.

30:33.729 --> 30:38.484
- My daughter...
- I can't do it, Shelly.

30:38.567 --> 30:41.654
I got to tell you something.
It wasn't so long ago,

30:41.696 --> 30:45.574
I'd pick up the phone
and call Murray-- I got your job.

30:45.658 --> 30:49.036
"Murray, the kid is burning my ass."
"Shelly, he's gone."

30:49.120 --> 30:53.916
You are gone before
I'm back from lunch.

30:54.000 --> 30:55.710
Bought him a trip
to Bermuda once.

30:55.793 --> 30:57.628
- I've got to go.
- All right, hey.

30:57.670 --> 31:02.216
Give me-- I'll take two more
of the old leads.

31:02.300 --> 31:04.885
- I gave you two today.
- One is a bust-out, John!

31:04.969 --> 31:06.929
- The other ain't home!
- Shelly--

31:07.013 --> 31:08.139
I promise you,
I've been on the phone-- I know.

31:08.180 --> 31:09.890
No more leads today--
two per day. You've got yours.

31:09.974 --> 31:11.976
All right.

31:12.059 --> 31:14.478
- All right?
- Sure.

31:19.692 --> 31:24.155
We will do that...
other thing.

31:25.865 --> 31:29.035
I guess I left
my wallet in my room.

31:35.207 --> 31:38.210
Deadbeats.
Deadbeats, all of 'em.

31:38.294 --> 31:42.006
My mistake.
I shouldn't have took the leads.

31:42.048 --> 31:44.342
- You had to.
- Yeah? Why?

31:44.425 --> 31:46.677
- To get on the--
- To get on the board, yeah.

31:46.719 --> 31:48.846
How am I gonna get on the board
trying to sell a doctor?

31:48.888 --> 31:50.681
Two regular,
two chocolate donuts.

31:50.723 --> 31:53.809
Give me the same thing to go.
And don't try and sell an Indian.

31:53.893 --> 31:55.561
I will never try to sell
an Indian.

31:55.645 --> 31:57.897
These names come up--
you ever get 'em-- "Patel"?

31:57.980 --> 32:00.942
- You ever get 'em?
- I think I had one once.

32:01.025 --> 32:03.319
You had one,
you'd know it-- "Patel."

32:03.402 --> 32:05.029
They keep coming up.
I don't know.

32:05.112 --> 32:07.448
They like to talk to salesmen.
They're lonely.

32:07.531 --> 32:10.242
They like to feel superior--
never bought a fucking thing.

32:10.326 --> 32:12.912
I don't know.
Come down the line--

32:12.995 --> 32:17.458
doctors, lawyers, Indians--
times are tight. It's tight.

32:17.541 --> 32:22.046
Pressure's just too great.
Man can't work all of 'em.

32:22.088 --> 32:25.841
You go in the door-- I got to close
this fucker or I don't eat lunch,

32:25.925 --> 32:29.637
or I don't win a Cadillac.
We work too hard, George.

32:31.847 --> 32:37.103
Remember when we were-- when we
were selling Glen Ross Farms?

32:37.186 --> 32:39.438
Didn't we sell
a bunch of that?

32:39.563 --> 32:41.732
- They came in--
- They fucked it up.

32:41.774 --> 32:43.734
- They did.
- They killed the goose. And now...

32:43.818 --> 32:46.112
- We're stuck with this--
- Stuck with this fucking shit.

32:46.195 --> 32:47.822
- This shit.
- It's too...

32:47.905 --> 32:50.157
- It is.
- You get a bad month--

32:50.241 --> 32:53.661
they put you on this board.
Some contest board.

32:53.744 --> 32:56.205
- It's not right.
- It's not right to the customers.

32:56.289 --> 32:58.582
I know, it's-- hey. What did I learn
as a kid on Western?

33:00.293 --> 33:04.630
Don't sell a guy one car.
Sell him five cars over 15 years.

33:04.714 --> 33:06.424
- That's right.
- You're goddamn right, it's right.

33:06.507 --> 33:09.468
Guys come in-- "Oh, the blah,
blah, blah. I know what I'll do.

33:09.552 --> 33:11.971
I'll go out and rob everybody
blind and go to Argentina

33:12.013 --> 33:13.889
'cause nobody ever
thought of this before."

33:13.973 --> 33:16.809
So they kill the goose
and the man's worked all his life--

33:16.892 --> 33:18.811
- That's right.
- He's got to cower in his boots--

33:18.811 --> 33:19.937
Boots, yes...

33:20.021 --> 33:23.357
For some fucking "Sell 10,000,
win the steak knives."

33:23.441 --> 33:25.318
- What do you do?
- What can you do?

33:25.401 --> 33:27.820
What can you do
if you don't have the leads?

33:27.862 --> 33:30.615
If you do not
have the goddamn leads!

33:30.823 --> 33:33.701
Mr. Spannel?
Sheldon Levene.

33:33.784 --> 33:35.786
I was speaking
to your wife earlier?

33:35.870 --> 33:37.747
Come in.

33:39.040 --> 33:41.208
- "Cats and dogs," huh?
- Yeah.

33:41.292 --> 33:43.920
Oh, "cats and dogs."

33:46.213 --> 33:49.008
Oh, I see you're
interested in fishing.

33:49.091 --> 33:51.802
- Yeah.
- I've fished myself-- many years.

33:51.844 --> 33:54.680
Muskee, Wisconsin.
Ooh, a beauty.

33:57.016 --> 33:59.435
- Where's the missus?
- Out at the PTA.

33:59.518 --> 34:01.354
- Ahh.
- What was this in reference...?

34:01.437 --> 34:03.481
I spoke to your wife
earlier on the phone.

34:03.564 --> 34:05.483
I called, I'm in town
with Rio Rancho.

34:05.524 --> 34:08.736
Yes, I'm sorry. She said you had
some sort of award?

34:08.819 --> 34:12.073
Yes, I was speaking to the people
in my sales organization--

34:12.156 --> 34:15.910
my representatives in this area--
and Mr. Spannel--

34:15.993 --> 34:18.829
your name is Larry.
Mind if I call you Larry?

34:18.871 --> 34:22.583
All right, Larry.
We had a consultant,

34:22.667 --> 34:25.795
and he made me--
he made me an offer.

34:25.878 --> 34:29.423
He offered me $230,000
to promote a sales plan--

34:29.507 --> 34:34.011
to present investment opportunities
in Rio Rancho to the public.

34:34.095 --> 34:37.348
Well, I said, "Hell,
let me save you the 230,

34:37.431 --> 34:40.476
and pass the savings
along to the investor."

34:40.559 --> 34:43.729
My people immediately said,
"Whoa, how do you do that?

34:43.813 --> 34:46.774
How can you present
investment opportunities

34:46.857 --> 34:49.026
without television,
without magazine ads?"

34:49.110 --> 34:51.028
I said, "You take
something this good,

34:51.070 --> 34:53.322
you go to a man--
has invested in the past--

34:53.364 --> 34:57.243
you go to him direct and offer
the money to him-- rebate.

34:57.326 --> 35:00.454
And don't give it
to this expert."

35:01.872 --> 35:03.916
So you're here
to sell me some land?

35:04.000 --> 35:06.168
No, I wouldn't try
to sell you--

35:06.252 --> 35:09.589
I leave that to the salesmen
and people who want to own land.

35:09.672 --> 35:12.425
I think something
has to be fed,

35:12.508 --> 35:15.428
watered and painted,
but don't invest in it.

35:15.511 --> 35:18.055
That motto has stood me
in good stead.

35:18.139 --> 35:20.349
- Mister--
- Just call me Shelly.

35:20.391 --> 35:22.643
I have never
been afraid of familiarity.

35:22.727 --> 35:24.729
I'm walking out the door.
I've got to pick up my wife at the--

35:24.812 --> 35:27.231
Let's take my car.
We'll pick her up together.

35:27.273 --> 35:29.525
Spoke to the little woman
on the phone-- can't wait to meet her.

35:29.609 --> 35:31.402
No, we're going
over to our relatives'.

35:31.444 --> 35:34.113
- She didn't say anything about that.
- I'm sure she forgot.

35:34.196 --> 35:36.824
- I'm on a plane to Florida--
- I'm sorry if we put you out.

35:36.907 --> 35:39.410
You didn't put me out.
I'm just trying to think, Larry.

35:39.493 --> 35:42.079
You know, that's the only parcel
that I've got.

35:42.121 --> 35:44.874
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go back to the computer,

35:44.957 --> 35:48.085
I'm gonna pull another one, and we're
gonna speak to your relatives, too.

35:48.169 --> 35:50.546
- No, no, no.
- C'mon, you're a busy man, so am I.

35:50.630 --> 35:53.466
My God, I'm in the act
of giving a gift away.

35:53.549 --> 35:56.469
Look, I don't want to buy land.
I don't want to invest in land.

35:56.552 --> 36:01.098
I have nothing. She took the call
without my knowledge.

36:01.182 --> 36:03.434
I have no business
that I wish to transact.

36:03.517 --> 36:05.353
I don't want to tell you
how to handle your wife.

36:05.436 --> 36:09.273
My wife filled in a form, and we
have been plagued for the last year--

36:09.315 --> 36:12.318
That's the situation
I'm trying to alleviate, Larry.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.153
No, no.
Do you understand?

36:15.363 --> 36:17.239
Thank you. No.

36:33.005 --> 36:35.216
- Roma, man-- he don't care.
- He don't care.

36:35.299 --> 36:38.678
He's sitting on top of the world.
He's got good leads, good prospects.

36:38.761 --> 36:41.138
- Sales, sales.
- Sales contests.

36:41.222 --> 36:44.016
- That's what I'm saying.
- Times turn hard, they bounce you out.

36:44.100 --> 36:46.102
If they bounce you with no
confidence--

36:46.185 --> 36:48.771
That's what I'm saying.
That's what I'm saying to you.

36:54.151 --> 36:56.612
If they get you
on a bad beat--

36:56.696 --> 36:59.156
and you got to go out there,
get a new job--

36:59.240 --> 37:00.992
- With no--
- With no confidence--

37:01.033 --> 37:02.618
Yes.

37:02.660 --> 37:06.914
I'll tell you what the hard part is--
to stop thinking like a goddamn slave.

37:06.998 --> 37:10.459
You say the Nazis
in Europe--
"If they came in my door"--

37:10.543 --> 37:12.920
bullshit, the time is now.
What do you do now?

37:13.004 --> 37:15.298
Some guy pissing in your face.
Cocksucker--

37:15.381 --> 37:17.842
wants to break your rice bowl.

37:17.883 --> 37:21.470
Mitch and Murray, fuck you.
What I say-- fuck you!

37:21.554 --> 37:24.348
Sitting on the good leads.

37:24.432 --> 37:27.268
George, we're men here.

37:28.686 --> 37:29.854
Yes.

37:29.937 --> 37:33.858
And I'll tell you--
I'll tell you what the hard part is.

37:33.941 --> 37:36.527
- What?
- Starting up.

37:36.611 --> 37:39.322
Standing up.
Breaking free of this bullshit,

37:39.405 --> 37:43.117
this enslavement to some guy,
'cause he's got the upper hand.

37:45.870 --> 37:48.831
This is the difference--
listen to me, George.

37:48.873 --> 37:51.042
Now Jerry Graff went
into business for himself.

37:51.125 --> 37:56.714
He said, "I'm going on my own."
And he was free, you understand me?

37:57.924 --> 38:00.968
I'll tell you-- I'll tell you
what somebody should do.

38:04.013 --> 38:05.014
What?

38:05.097 --> 38:07.725
Somebody should stand up
and strike back.

38:07.767 --> 38:10.102
Somebody should do something
to them.

38:10.186 --> 38:12.396
- What?
- Something to pay them back.

38:12.480 --> 38:14.315
Someone should hurt them,
Mitch and Murray.

38:14.398 --> 38:16.067
- Somebody should hurt them?
- Yeah.

38:16.150 --> 38:18.027
- How?
- Someone should do something

38:18.110 --> 38:19.820
- to hurt them where they live.
- What?

38:19.904 --> 38:23.074
Someone should rob the office.
That's what I'm saying.

38:23.157 --> 38:26.619
If we were that kind of guy
to hold up the joint and trash it,

38:26.661 --> 38:29.747
it looks like robbery,
we take the leads out of the files

38:29.789 --> 38:31.749
and we go to Jerry Graff.

38:31.791 --> 38:35.628
And we take the fucking
Glengarry leads! Huh?

38:38.464 --> 38:41.717
Yeah, Mr. Nyborg? Ah, Mr. Nyborg,
Sheldon Levene.

38:41.801 --> 38:44.387
I was speaking to your wife earlier.
That's right.

38:44.470 --> 38:48.099
I'd like to speak to you
about awarding you your prize.

38:48.182 --> 38:50.184
We're coming to the end
of our fiscal year,

38:50.268 --> 38:52.937
I'd really like to get it
off the books before--

38:53.020 --> 38:56.023
yes, the prize
for Consolidated Properties.

38:56.107 --> 38:58.609
The information you requested
on Rio Rancho.

38:58.693 --> 39:01.904
Now, I'm in town only for--
well, let me see.

39:01.946 --> 39:04.949
I suppose I could
swing by tonight. Yes. Uh-huh.

39:04.991 --> 39:07.576
When do you think
it might be more convenient?

39:07.618 --> 39:10.246
As I said,
I could swing by tonight--

39:10.288 --> 39:12.790
well, of course,
you speak to your wife.

39:12.873 --> 39:14.792
Grace, I'm gonna need

39:14.875 --> 39:17.420
a first-class seat,
passport, 10,000 in cash,

39:17.503 --> 39:19.755
put that with the negotiable
papers, if you would.

39:19.839 --> 39:24.051
And put me
on the telex hookup-- yes?

39:24.135 --> 39:27.597
Well, when do you think
Mrs. Nyborg might be back?

39:28.139 --> 39:31.100
All train compartments
smell vaguely of shit.

39:31.183 --> 39:34.395
It gets so you don't
mind it.

39:34.478 --> 39:37.607
That's the worst thing
that I can confess.

39:37.690 --> 39:40.276
You know how long it took me
to get there? A long time.

39:42.028 --> 39:46.490
When you die you're gonna regret
the things you don't do.

39:46.532 --> 39:49.619
You think you're queer?
I'm gonna tell you something.

39:49.702 --> 39:53.164
We're all queer.
You think you're a thief? So what?

39:53.205 --> 39:55.791
You get befuddled
by a middle-class morality?

39:55.875 --> 39:57.835
Get shut of it.
Shut it out.

39:57.877 --> 40:01.964
You cheat on your wife,
you did it. Live with it.

40:02.048 --> 40:05.301
You fuck little girls,
so be it.

40:05.384 --> 40:09.138
There's an absolute morality?
Maybe.

40:09.221 --> 40:11.849
And then what?

40:11.933 --> 40:15.478
If you think there is,
go ahead, be that thing.

40:15.686 --> 40:18.481
Bad people go to hell?
I don't think so.

40:18.564 --> 40:20.524
You think that,
act that way.

40:20.566 --> 40:26.989
A hell exists on earth?
Yes. I won't live in it.

40:27.031 --> 40:29.033
That's me.

40:33.746 --> 40:37.625
Did you ever take a dump, made you
feel like you slept for 12 hours?

40:37.708 --> 40:40.336
- Did I...?
- Yes.

40:40.419 --> 40:43.923
- I don't know.
- Or a piss?

40:48.302 --> 40:51.264
Great meals fade
in reflection.

40:51.347 --> 40:54.016
Everything else gains.
Do you know why?

40:54.100 --> 40:57.478
'Cause it's only food.
This shit we put in us,

40:57.561 --> 40:59.981
keeps us going--
it's only food.

41:01.232 --> 41:03.526
The great fucks
you may have had,

41:03.609 --> 41:05.569
what do you remember
about them?

41:05.611 --> 41:09.699
- What do I remember?
- Yeah.

41:11.492 --> 41:13.202
I don't know.
For me,

41:13.286 --> 41:16.747
I'm saying what it is,
it's probably not the orgasm.

41:18.457 --> 41:22.211
Some broad's forearm
on your neck,

41:22.295 --> 41:26.757
something her eyes did.
There was this sound she made.

41:27.925 --> 41:30.720
Or it's me in the--
I'm telling you--

41:30.803 --> 41:34.765
I'm in bed the next day,
she brought me café au lait,

41:34.807 --> 41:38.269
gives me a cigarette,
my balls feel like concrete.

41:38.311 --> 41:39.854
Eh?

41:41.939 --> 41:44.275
What I'm saying,
what is our life?

41:45.985 --> 41:49.697
Our life is looking forward
or it's looking back.

41:49.780 --> 41:53.576
That's it.
That's our life.

41:53.659 --> 41:56.245
Where's the moment?

42:00.791 --> 42:03.753
And what is it
we're so afraid of?

42:03.794 --> 42:05.713
Loss. What else?

42:05.796 --> 42:10.927
The bank closes, we get sick,
my wife died on a plane?

42:12.386 --> 42:15.598
The stock market collapsed?
What of these things happen?

42:15.640 --> 42:18.768
None of them.
We worry anyway. Why?

42:21.145 --> 42:22.104
What could we get
for them?

42:22.188 --> 42:24.941
- For them?
- For the leads.

42:24.982 --> 42:26.984
What could we get
for the leads?

42:27.068 --> 42:31.447
I don't know. 10 bucks a throw.
15 maybe. I don't know.

42:32.990 --> 42:35.660
For the leads, you're saying?
Say somebody took them,

42:35.743 --> 42:38.871
- went to Jerry Graff?
- Yeah. How many leads do we have?

42:38.955 --> 42:40.247
The Glengarry?
The premium leads?

42:40.331 --> 42:43.542
I've got to think they've got 500.
Say 500 leads.

42:43.626 --> 42:46.879
You're saying a fella could take
those leads and sell them to Graff?

42:46.963 --> 42:49.215
The leads to Graff.
Yes. I was saying-- yeah.

42:49.298 --> 42:51.884
A guy could take--
like anything else, it seems to me,

42:51.968 --> 42:54.470
that is negotiable,
a guy could sell them.

42:54.553 --> 42:57.932
- How do you know he'd buy them?
- Because I worked for him.

42:58.015 --> 43:01.727
- You didn't talk to him?
- No. What do you mean?

43:01.811 --> 43:03.896
- Did I talk to him about this?
- Yeah.

43:03.980 --> 43:06.274
Are you just talking about this,
or are we just talking about it?

43:06.315 --> 43:08.776
- Just speaking about it.
- Speaking about it as an idea?

43:08.818 --> 43:10.987
- Yes.
- We're not actually talking about it.

43:11.028 --> 43:13.823
- No.
- Talking about it as a robbery.

43:13.864 --> 43:16.659
As a robbery? No.

43:19.078 --> 43:21.330
- Well...
- Hey.

43:21.372 --> 43:24.166
So all this--
you didn't actually call Graff?

43:24.250 --> 43:26.711
- You didn't talk to him?
- Not actually, no.

43:26.752 --> 43:29.005
- You didn't?
- No, not actually.

43:29.088 --> 43:30.673
- Did you?
- What did I say?

43:30.756 --> 43:32.550
- What did you say?
- I said, "Not actually."

43:32.633 --> 43:34.802
Fuck you care, George?
We're just talking.

43:34.885 --> 43:36.178
- We are?
- Yes.

43:36.220 --> 43:39.640
- Because it's a crime.
- Robbery. That's right.

43:41.475 --> 43:43.352
It is a crime.

43:45.938 --> 43:48.858
- It's also very safe.
- You're actually talking about this.

43:48.899 --> 43:51.694
- That's right.
- You're going to steal the leads.

43:51.736 --> 43:53.195
- Have I said that?
- Are you?

43:53.237 --> 43:55.031
- Did I say that?
- Did you talk to Graff?

43:55.114 --> 43:56.699
- What did I say?
- What did he say?

43:56.782 --> 43:58.576
What did he say?

44:01.787 --> 44:03.873
He'd buy them.

44:12.757 --> 44:14.884
You're gonna steal--

44:14.967 --> 44:18.137
you're gonna steal the Glengarry
leads and sell them to Graff?

44:18.220 --> 44:21.223
- Yes.
- What's he gonna pay?

44:21.307 --> 44:24.518
He figures there's 500 leads,
let's say 10 bucks apiece,

44:24.602 --> 44:28.189
- that's $2,500 each.
- Each?

44:28.272 --> 44:30.232
- "Each"?
- That's right, George.

44:30.274 --> 44:32.735
- You're saying me?
- No, you and me.

44:32.777 --> 44:37.031
Yeah. That's exactly
what I'm saying. $2,500 apiece.

44:37.114 --> 44:39.408
You and me for one night's work,
and a job with Graff

44:39.492 --> 44:42.244
- working the premium leads.
- A job with Graff?

44:42.328 --> 44:44.705
- Is that what I said?
- He'd give me a job?

44:44.789 --> 44:46.874
He could take you on.
Yes.

45:09.605 --> 45:11.065
Hello?

45:11.148 --> 45:13.567
I was dialing the direct line
to my daughter's room.

45:13.609 --> 45:16.362
Sheldon Levene.
She's in--

45:16.445 --> 45:20.992
well, yeah, I'm sure she's asleep.
But-- where's the duty nurse?

45:22.285 --> 45:25.579
They canceled her--
well, let me talk--

45:25.663 --> 45:27.665
who am I speaking to?

45:30.459 --> 45:33.713
I'll have the money there
tomorrow.

45:34.297 --> 45:36.257
It's a big decision,
George.

45:36.340 --> 45:39.719
At times a guy
has got to make one.

45:39.802 --> 45:41.929
It's a big decision
and it's a big reward.

45:42.013 --> 45:45.266
$2,500 and a job, it's a big reward
for one night's work.

45:45.391 --> 45:47.476
Yes.

45:47.518 --> 45:50.021
Sometimes a guy...

45:50.104 --> 45:52.481
sometimes, a man
if he wants a reward--

45:52.523 --> 45:55.109
That's absolutely right.

45:55.192 --> 45:57.153
He'll do one thing,
one thing on one night.

45:57.236 --> 46:01.824
That's absolutely right.
The thing is, it's got to be tonight.

46:01.866 --> 46:02.950
What?

46:03.034 --> 46:04.994
What, what?
The leads ain't going to leave?

46:05.077 --> 46:07.288
They bring those leads up,
wave them under your nose,

46:07.371 --> 46:09.498
tomorrow they take them downtown,
parcel them out.

46:09.582 --> 46:12.335
A guy wants those leads,
he's gonna have to get them tonight.

46:12.418 --> 46:15.379
Tonight is the thing.
Talk about a chance.

46:15.421 --> 46:17.173
It's when a chance
presents itself.

46:17.214 --> 46:18.841
You got to go
in there tonight.

46:18.925 --> 46:20.259
- You.
- I'm sorry?

46:20.343 --> 46:22.011
- You.
- Me?

46:22.094 --> 46:24.138
You have to go in.
You have to get the leads.

46:24.221 --> 46:26.682
- I do?
- It's not something for nothing.

46:26.724 --> 46:30.478
I took you in on this.
You have to go. It's your thing.

46:30.561 --> 46:32.730
I've made a deal with Graff.
I can't go in.

46:32.813 --> 46:36.067
I've spoken out on this too much.
I've got a big mouth.

46:36.150 --> 46:39.153
"The fucking leads," et cetera,
"the tight-ass company," blah, blah.

46:39.236 --> 46:42.198
- They'll know when you go to Graff.
- What will they know?

46:42.239 --> 46:44.492
That I stole the leads?
I didn't steal the leads.

46:44.575 --> 46:47.328
I'm gonna go to the movies.
Then I'm gonna have a late drink

46:47.411 --> 46:49.580
- at the Como Inn with a friend.
- Dave.

46:49.664 --> 46:50.957
Yes?

46:51.040 --> 46:53.125
You want me to break into the office
tonight and steal the leads?

46:53.209 --> 46:54.460
- Yes.
- No.

46:54.543 --> 46:56.128
- Oh, yes, George.
- What does that mean?

46:56.212 --> 47:00.633
Listen to this. I have an alibi.
I'm going to the Como Inn.

47:00.716 --> 47:03.469
Why? Why?
The place gets robbed,

47:03.552 --> 47:06.013
they're going to come looking for me.
Why? Because I probably did it.

47:06.055 --> 47:08.516
Let me ask you this--
are you going to turn me in?

47:08.557 --> 47:10.393
What if you don't get caught?

47:10.476 --> 47:11.978
They come to you,
are you going to turn me in?

47:12.019 --> 47:14.063
- Why would they come to me?
- They're going to come to everybody.

47:14.146 --> 47:15.898
- Why would I do it?
- You wouldn't, George.

47:15.982 --> 47:17.984
That's why I'm talking to you now.
They come to you,

47:18.067 --> 47:19.860
- are you going to turn me in?
- No.

47:19.902 --> 47:21.570
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

47:21.612 --> 47:26.659
Uh-huh. George...
when they come to me,

47:26.742 --> 47:29.370
if I have to go in there,
and if I get caught--

47:29.453 --> 47:32.290
- they come to me...
- You don't have to go in.

47:32.373 --> 47:34.208
I have to go in, see?
That's something I have to do.

47:34.292 --> 47:36.377
- Why?
- Why?

47:36.419 --> 47:38.045
Are you going to give me $7,500?

47:38.087 --> 47:40.339
75? I thought we were
splitting five grand.

47:40.423 --> 47:43.384
I lied, all right? Your end is 25,
my end is my own concern.

47:43.467 --> 47:46.429
Now, stick with me here.
If they come to me,

47:46.512 --> 47:49.181
I'm caught, they're going to ask me
who were accomplices.

47:49.265 --> 47:50.891
- Me.
- Absolutely.

47:50.975 --> 47:52.268
That's ridiculous.

47:52.310 --> 47:54.186
To the law, you're
an accessory before the fact.

47:54.228 --> 47:57.148
- I didn't ask to be.
- Tough luck, because you are.

47:57.231 --> 47:59.859
- Because you told me about it?
- That's right.

47:59.942 --> 48:02.445
Why are you doing this
to me, Dave?

48:02.528 --> 48:05.156
Why are you talking this way to me?
I don't understand.

48:05.239 --> 48:08.451
- Why are you doing this at all?
- None of your fucking business.

48:08.534 --> 48:10.411
Just in or out?
You tell me.

48:10.494 --> 48:12.038
You're out,
you take the consequences.

48:12.121 --> 48:14.040
- I do?
- That's right.

48:14.123 --> 48:16.083
- And why is that?
- Because you listened.

48:16.751 --> 48:18.169
Well, when will
Mrs. Nyborg be back?

48:18.252 --> 48:20.838
You know, I hate to keep
calling you this late, Bruce,

48:20.922 --> 48:25.092
but I feel a responsibility,
I must say. When you have--

48:26.761 --> 48:30.222
You know, they say,
"You don't buy it, you rent it."

48:30.306 --> 48:32.600
- Huh?
- The thing.

48:32.683 --> 48:37.605
You really...
what do you keep?

48:37.647 --> 48:40.441
I mean, you don't keep
anything, really.

48:40.524 --> 48:43.277
- No.
- Security.

48:43.361 --> 48:45.947
Things. Things.

48:46.030 --> 48:48.407
- You know?
- Mm-hmm.

48:48.491 --> 48:53.079
It's just... you try
to stave off insecurity.

48:53.162 --> 48:54.580
You can't do it.

48:54.997 --> 48:57.083
- No.
- No. That's what I'm telling you.

48:57.166 --> 49:02.421
Stocks, bonds, objects of art,
real estate, what are they?

49:02.505 --> 49:05.967
An opportunity.
To what? To make money?

49:06.008 --> 49:09.971
Perhaps. To lose money?
Perhaps.

49:10.012 --> 49:13.516
To indulge and to learn
about ourselves? Perhaps.

49:13.599 --> 49:16.686
So fucking what?
What is it? They're an opportunity.

49:16.769 --> 49:19.689
That's all they are.
They're an event.

49:19.772 --> 49:23.442
A guy comes to you,
you make a call. You send in a card,

49:23.484 --> 49:26.279
I have these properties
I would like for you to see.

49:26.320 --> 49:29.365
What does this mean?
What do you want it to mean?

49:29.448 --> 49:31.575
You see what I'm saying?

49:34.203 --> 49:36.622
Things happen to you.

49:37.873 --> 49:40.501
Glad I met you.

49:40.585 --> 49:42.295
I'm glad I met you,
James.

49:44.422 --> 49:47.049
I want to show you
something.

49:47.133 --> 49:49.635
It may mean something to you,
it may not.

49:49.719 --> 49:52.555
I don't know.
I don't know anymore.

49:55.349 --> 49:58.394
What is that?
Florida.

49:58.477 --> 50:01.314
Glengarry Highlands.
Florida.

50:01.355 --> 50:04.358
Bullshit.
And maybe that's true.

50:04.442 --> 50:07.570
And that's what I said.

50:07.653 --> 50:10.156
But look at this.

50:10.239 --> 50:14.660
What is this?
This is a piece of land.

50:14.702 --> 50:17.163
Listen to what I'm going
to tell you now.

50:45.232 --> 50:47.318
- What happened?
- Where do you work?

50:47.401 --> 50:49.987
I work, yes.
I work here.

50:50.071 --> 50:52.531
- What is it? What happened?
- Robbery.

50:58.913 --> 51:03.042
Williamson. Williamson,
did they get the contracts?

51:05.753 --> 51:08.130
All right, tell me.
Now. Tell me.

51:08.214 --> 51:10.049
- They stole the contracts?
- Excuse me, sir.

51:10.091 --> 51:11.509
- Did they get my contract?
- Excuse me, fella.

51:11.592 --> 51:12.802
- Did they?
- Would you excuse us?

51:12.885 --> 51:15.012
Don't fuck with me, fella.
I'm talking about a Cadillac car

51:15.096 --> 51:17.723
- that you owe me.
- They didn't get your contract.

51:17.765 --> 51:20.142
- I filed it before I left.
- They didn't get my contracts?

51:20.226 --> 51:22.144
They got-- excuse me.

51:22.228 --> 51:24.230
Fuck.

51:24.313 --> 51:27.066
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
Williamson!

51:27.149 --> 51:30.069
- Williamson, open the fucking door.
- Who are you?

51:30.111 --> 51:32.238
- They didn't get the contracts.
- Did they?

51:32.321 --> 51:34.865
They got-- listen to me.
They got some of them.

51:34.949 --> 51:37.576
- Some of them?
- Who told you?

51:37.660 --> 51:40.997
Who told me?
Who told me we had a robbery?

51:41.080 --> 51:42.748
We got a fucking board
up on the window.

51:42.790 --> 51:47.253
Who is this? Yes.
Yes, I confess. I did it.

51:47.336 --> 51:49.630
Now, leave me
a second here, please.

51:49.714 --> 51:52.383
- Okay, now, talk to me.
- I'm still trying to sort it out.

51:52.466 --> 51:54.594
- So far--
- Talk to me. Talk to me.

51:54.677 --> 51:57.930
They got some
of the contracts?

51:58.014 --> 52:01.225
Lingk. James Lingk,
which I closed last night.

52:01.309 --> 52:02.935
- You closed it last night?
- Yes.

52:03.019 --> 52:06.689
- I filed it. It went down.
- You filed it?

52:06.772 --> 52:09.108
- James Lingk?
- Yes.

52:09.191 --> 52:11.110
- It was sent downtown?
- Yes, all right?

52:11.152 --> 52:13.112
I filed it last night.
It went to the bank.

52:13.154 --> 52:15.531
- It went downtown, all right?
- You filed it?

52:15.615 --> 52:18.242
Then I'm over the fucking top,
you owe me a Cadillac.

52:18.326 --> 52:20.536
- I don't--
- I don't want to hear any shit.

52:20.620 --> 52:23.581
I don't give a shit.
Lingk puts me over the top.

52:23.623 --> 52:26.626
You filed it. It went downtown.
Now you owe me the car.

52:26.709 --> 52:29.670
- The robbery makes difficult--
- Fuck you! You owe me the car!

52:29.754 --> 52:32.381
See, 'cause this is how
we keep score, "bubby."

52:32.465 --> 52:35.593
You told me, "Close thus,
and so you get the car."

52:35.676 --> 52:38.679
- I got it.
- Would you excuse us, please?

52:38.763 --> 52:41.682
You hear what I said?
Do you hear what I said?

52:41.766 --> 52:45.269
Hey, pal!
Your excuses are your own!

52:56.030 --> 52:58.574
"Recontact James Lingk.

52:58.658 --> 53:02.453
6:00 p.m. Morton Grove."
Ah-ha.

53:02.536 --> 53:05.039
When do you expect
her in?

53:05.122 --> 53:07.833
This is Ricky Roma
from last night.

53:07.917 --> 53:11.003
She'll remember.
Just, just-- wait a minute!

53:11.087 --> 53:14.423
Just to say-- to thank her
for a wonderful time.

53:14.507 --> 53:16.968
Thank you.
I'll call back later. Thank you.

53:17.009 --> 53:19.428
They should check
if we're insured.

53:21.764 --> 53:24.433
Uh-huh.

53:24.517 --> 53:27.436
"10:00 p.m., Octavia."

53:27.520 --> 53:30.523
Please don't leave.
I'm going to talk to you.

53:30.606 --> 53:33.484
- What's your name?
- Are you talking to me?

53:33.567 --> 53:36.570
- That's right.
- My name is Richard Roma.

53:48.416 --> 53:51.043
I-- you know,
they should be insured.

53:51.127 --> 53:53.588
- What do you care?
- Then they wouldn't be so upset.

53:53.671 --> 53:56.173
- Huh?
- They wouldn't be so upset.

53:56.257 --> 53:58.884
- Mitch and Murray.
- Yeah, you're right.

53:58.926 --> 54:00.761
That's right.
How are you?

54:00.845 --> 54:03.055
I'm fine.

54:03.139 --> 54:05.600
You mean the board?
You mean on the board?

54:07.393 --> 54:10.563
Yes. Okay.
The board.

54:10.646 --> 54:13.149
I'm fucked on the board.
I can't--

54:15.443 --> 54:18.029
My mind must be other places,
'cause I can't--

54:18.112 --> 54:20.531
What?
You can't do what?

54:20.573 --> 54:23.367
- I can't close them.
- Well, they're old.

54:23.451 --> 54:27.121
Look, look at this shit
they're giving you. Huh?

54:27.204 --> 54:29.415
- Yes, they are old.
- They're ancient.

54:29.498 --> 54:31.959
"Clear Meadows."
This shit's dead.

54:32.043 --> 54:33.377
- It is dead.
- Waste of time.

54:33.461 --> 54:37.924
- Yes. I'm no fucking good.
- Hey, fuck that shit, George.

54:38.007 --> 54:40.259
You had a bad month.
You're a good man.

54:40.343 --> 54:42.094
- I am?
- Yeah, you had a bad streak.

54:42.178 --> 54:45.932
Look at this. 15 units, Mountain View,
the fucking things get stolen.

54:46.015 --> 54:49.644
- He said he filed--
- He filed the big one.

54:49.727 --> 54:51.896
He filed the guy from the bar
that I closed last night.

54:51.938 --> 54:54.440
All the little ones,
I got to go back.

54:56.734 --> 54:59.445
Can you believe this?
I got to go back and close again.

54:59.528 --> 55:02.114
I mean, talk about
a fucking beat

55:02.198 --> 55:05.785
that would sap anyone's-- wait,
wait, wait. Where are the phones?

55:05.868 --> 55:08.704
- They stole--
- They stole...?

55:08.788 --> 55:11.290
- What kind of an outfit is it...
- They stole the phones.

55:11.374 --> 55:14.126
...when criminals come and they take--
they steal the phones?

55:14.210 --> 55:16.420
They stole the leads.
They stole the phones,

55:16.462 --> 55:19.090
they stole-- aw, Christ.

55:19.173 --> 55:23.427
What am I going
to do this month? Shit.

55:23.469 --> 55:25.471
You think they're going to catch--
where are you going?

55:25.513 --> 55:27.682
Down the street.

55:29.141 --> 55:33.688
- Where are you going?
- To the-- what do you fucking care?

55:33.771 --> 55:38.192
- Aren't you going out today?
- With what, John? With what?

55:38.276 --> 55:41.445
Well, answer me.
They stole the Glengarry leads.

55:41.529 --> 55:44.991
- They stole Rio Rancho.
- I have stuff from last year's file.

55:45.074 --> 55:48.286
Oh, oh, oh.
Your "nostalgia" file.

55:48.369 --> 55:51.122
Oh, great. That's great,
'cause I don't...

55:51.163 --> 55:53.416
- Do you want to go out today?
- I don't have to eat this month.

55:53.499 --> 55:56.085
Great.
Give them to me.

55:56.168 --> 55:59.589
Bring them.
Come on.

56:00.965 --> 56:04.594
Fucking Mitch and Murray
are going to shit a--

56:04.635 --> 56:07.805
What am I going
to do all month?

56:07.888 --> 56:10.182
See, the thing
of it is,

56:10.308 --> 56:12.727
is were the leads insured?
You think?

56:12.852 --> 56:15.771
- What?
- Were the leads insured?

56:15.855 --> 56:18.190
I don't know, why?

56:18.274 --> 56:20.151
'Cause if they weren't,
I know Mitch and Murray...

56:20.234 --> 56:22.612
- What?
- They'll be upset.

56:22.695 --> 56:25.156
That's right.

56:25.239 --> 56:27.450
You're right.

56:28.701 --> 56:31.203
He said we're all going
to have to talk to the guy.

56:31.287 --> 56:32.830
- To...
- The cop.

56:32.914 --> 56:34.957
Great. We have to talk
to the cop.

56:35.041 --> 56:38.711
- Another waste of time.
- A waste of time? Why?

56:38.794 --> 56:40.713
Why? 'Cause they're not going
to find the guy.

56:40.796 --> 56:44.675
- The cops?
- Yes, the cops. No.

56:44.717 --> 56:46.385
The cops aren't going
to find the guy?

56:46.469 --> 56:48.220
- Nope.
- Why do you think so?

56:48.304 --> 56:49.805
Why? Because they are stupid.
Where were you last night?

56:52.058 --> 56:54.393
- Where were you?
- Where was I?

56:54.435 --> 56:55.519
- Yeah.
- I was at home.

56:55.561 --> 56:56.687
- Where were you?
- At home.

56:56.729 --> 56:58.606
See? Were you the guy
who broke in?

56:58.689 --> 56:59.732
- Was I?
- Yes.

56:59.815 --> 57:02.026
- No.
- Then don't sweat it. You know why?

57:02.068 --> 57:04.195
- No.
- You have nothing to hide.

57:04.278 --> 57:06.989
- When I talk to police, I get nervous.
- Yes, you know who doesn't?

57:07.073 --> 57:09.617
- No. Who?
- Thieves.

57:09.408 --> 57:11.369
I don't know
what I'm going to tell them.

57:11.410 --> 57:13.746
The truth.
Always tell them the truth.

57:13.788 --> 57:15.831
It's the easiest thing
to remember.

57:16.415 --> 57:19.418
Whoa, whoa!
"Patel"?

57:19.502 --> 57:21.963
"Ravidam Patel"?

57:22.046 --> 57:23.839
How am I going to make a living
on these deadbeats?

57:23.923 --> 57:25.883
- Where did you get this from, a morgue?
- Look, I'm--

57:25.967 --> 57:29.095
Come on. What's the point?
What's the fucking point?

57:29.178 --> 57:32.056
I got to argue with you,
I got to knock heads with the cops,

57:32.139 --> 57:33.933
I'm busting my balls
to sell your dirt

57:34.016 --> 57:36.811
to deadbeats--
money in the mattress.

57:36.894 --> 57:39.397
I come back, you can't even
keep the contracts safe.

57:39.480 --> 57:41.649
I got to go out--
fuck this shit.

57:41.732 --> 57:43.526
I'm going to go out
and re-close last week's stuff.

57:43.609 --> 57:45.653
No, the word from Murray
is leave them alone.

57:45.736 --> 57:47.947
If he needs a new sig,
he'll go out himself.

57:47.989 --> 57:50.992
- Murray's gonna go out?
- He'll be "president of the company

57:51.033 --> 57:53.369
just in from out of town,"
all right?

57:54.912 --> 57:57.915
Okay, okay, okay.
Give me this shit.

57:57.999 --> 58:00.459
- I'm giving you three leads.
- Three? I count two.

58:00.501 --> 58:02.712
- There's three leads there.
- Patel? Fuck you.

58:02.795 --> 58:05.798
Fucking Shiva handed
this guy a million dollars,

58:05.881 --> 58:08.092
told him, "Sign the deal,"
he wouldn't sign.

58:08.175 --> 58:10.928
And the god Vishnu, too,
into the bargain. Fuck you.

58:11.012 --> 58:13.848
You know your business, I know mine.
Your business is being an asshole.

58:13.931 --> 58:16.517
If I find out whose fucking cousin
you are, I'm gonna go to him

58:16.601 --> 58:20.813
and figure out a way
to have your ass-- fuck you!

58:20.896 --> 58:23.524
I'm waiting
for the new leads.

58:27.194 --> 58:30.323
Get the chalk!
Hey! Get the chalk!

58:30.364 --> 58:32.241
Get the--
I did it-- I closed 'em.

58:32.325 --> 58:34.076
I closed the cocksucker.
Get the chalk.

58:34.160 --> 58:37.663
Put me on the board, John.
Put me on the Cadillac board!

58:37.747 --> 58:40.458
Williamson,
pick up the fucking chalk.

58:40.541 --> 58:44.629
- Rick-- eight units, Mountain View.
- You sold eight Mountain View?

58:44.670 --> 58:47.006
You bet your ass!
Who wants to go to lunch?

58:47.048 --> 58:49.175
Who wants to go to lunch--
I'm buying.

58:49.300 --> 58:53.012
Williamson-- $82,000,
12 grand in my commission.

58:53.095 --> 58:55.348
On deadbeat
magazine subscription leads.

58:55.431 --> 58:58.059
- Who?
- Bruce and Harriett Nyborg.

58:58.100 --> 59:00.519
Read it.
What the hell happened here?

59:00.603 --> 59:02.730
Fuck! I had them
on River Glen.

59:02.813 --> 59:04.565
- What happened?
- Somebody broke in.

59:04.649 --> 59:06.817
- Eight units!
- Yeah.

59:06.901 --> 59:09.779
- Shelly!
- Big deal-- I broke a bad streak.

59:09.862 --> 59:12.073
Shelly "The Machine" Levene.
That's great.

59:12.156 --> 59:14.075
Thank you, George.
Hey--

59:14.158 --> 59:16.577
- grab the phone, call Mitch.
- They took the phones.

59:16.661 --> 59:18.246
- Huh?
- Aaronow?

59:18.287 --> 59:20.581
They took the leads,
the cash, the contracts.

59:20.623 --> 59:22.458
- We had a robbery.
- When?

59:22.541 --> 59:25.253
- Last night, this morning.
- They took the leads?

59:28.047 --> 59:30.049
Fucking asshole.

59:30.132 --> 59:32.260
What? They beat you
with a rubber bat?

59:32.343 --> 59:34.679
Cop couldn't find his dick
with two hands and a map.

59:34.762 --> 59:37.098
Anybody who talks to this asshole
is a fucking asshole.

59:37.181 --> 59:39.267
- You gonna turn state's?
- Fuck you, Ricky.

59:39.350 --> 59:42.228
I ain't going out today.
I'm going home.

59:42.311 --> 59:44.605
I'm going home because nothing's
accomplished here.

59:44.689 --> 59:46.732
- Anybody talks to this guy--
- Guess what "The Machine" did.

59:46.816 --> 59:50.111
- Fuck "The Machine."
- Mountain View, eight units.

59:50.194 --> 59:53.281
Cop's got no right to talk to me
that way. I did not rob the place.

59:53.364 --> 59:56.492
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah, he closed the deal.

59:56.576 --> 59:58.911
Eight units,
Mountain View.

59:58.953 --> 1:00:01.497
- You did that?
- Yeah.

1:00:02.707 --> 1:00:04.834
- Fuck you.
- Guess who?

1:00:04.917 --> 1:00:06.502
- When?
- Just now.

1:00:06.586 --> 1:00:08.879
- Guess who?
- You just-- this morning?

1:00:08.963 --> 1:00:11.424
Harriett
and blah blah Nyborg.

1:00:11.507 --> 1:00:14.760
- You did that?
- Yeah-- $82,000.

1:00:15.845 --> 1:00:19.390
- Those fucking deadbeats.
- My ass. I told 'em-- listen to this.

1:00:19.473 --> 1:00:22.643
- I don't want to hear your war stories.
- Fuck you, Dave.

1:00:22.727 --> 1:00:25.146
I said, "You have to believe
in yourself."

1:00:25.229 --> 1:00:27.607
Give me a lead.
I'm going out. I'm getting out.

1:00:27.690 --> 1:00:32.528
- Fuck the leads. I'm going home.
- "Fuck me, Bruce.

1:00:32.612 --> 1:00:34.155
- You have to believe in yourself."
- We haven't got a lead.

1:00:34.238 --> 1:00:36.699
- Why not?
- They took 'em.

1:00:36.782 --> 1:00:39.368
They're fucking garbage, any case.
The whole goddamn--

1:00:39.452 --> 1:00:42.788
"You look around, you say,
'This one has so-and-so. I got nothing.

1:00:42.830 --> 1:00:45.333
But why? Why don't I get
the opportunities?"'

1:00:45.416 --> 1:00:48.002
- Did they steal the contracts?
- What the fuck do you care?

1:00:48.085 --> 1:00:49.879
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

1:00:49.962 --> 1:00:51.964
Will you shut up?
I'm telling him something.

1:00:53.925 --> 1:00:55.593
Could we get
some coffee?

1:00:55.676 --> 1:00:57.803
- How are you doing?
- Fine.

1:00:59.805 --> 1:01:00.973
Uh-huh.

1:01:01.057 --> 1:01:02.975
Anybody's going out,
I could use some coffee.

1:01:05.353 --> 1:01:08.814
- "You do get the opportunity."
- Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1:01:08.898 --> 1:01:11.192
"You do get the opportunities.
You get 'em as I get 'em,

1:01:11.692 --> 1:01:13.986
- as everybody gets 'em."
- I don't care they stole the contracts?

1:01:14.070 --> 1:01:16.197
I got 'em in the kitchen,
eating their crumb cake--

1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:18.491
- What does that mean?
- It means, Dave,

1:01:18.574 --> 1:01:20.826
You haven't closed
a good one in a month.

1:01:20.910 --> 1:01:22.703
None of my business,
you want to push me to answer you.

1:01:22.787 --> 1:01:25.873
So you haven't got a contract
to get stolen and so forth.

1:01:25.957 --> 1:01:28.793
You got a mean streak in you.
Shut the fuck up!

1:01:28.876 --> 1:01:32.046
Ricky, you got a mean streak in you,
and what are you babbling about?

1:01:32.129 --> 1:01:34.006
You bring that shit up--
on my volume?

1:01:34.090 --> 1:01:37.218
If you were on a bad one and I
brought it up to you, you'd harbor it.

1:01:37.301 --> 1:01:39.762
You'd harbor it a long while
and you'd be right.

1:01:39.845 --> 1:01:42.223
- Who said "Fuck 'The Machine"'?
- Fuck "The Machine"?

1:01:42.265 --> 1:01:44.809
Fuck "The Machine"?
Fuck "The Machine"!

1:01:44.892 --> 1:01:48.229
What is this, courtesy class?
You're fucked, Rick.

1:01:48.312 --> 1:01:51.065
Are you fucking nuts?
You're hot, so you think

1:01:51.148 --> 1:01:52.733
- you're the ruler of this place.
- Wait a minute, Dave.

1:01:52.817 --> 1:01:54.527
- Shut up!
- Okay...

1:01:54.610 --> 1:01:57.113
You want to decide who
should be dealt with how, is that it?

1:01:57.196 --> 1:02:00.074
I come into the office today,
I get humiliated by some jag-off cop.

1:02:00.157 --> 1:02:02.034
I get accused of--

1:02:02.118 --> 1:02:05.788
I get shit thrown in my face because
you're top name on the board?

1:02:05.871 --> 1:02:08.708
Is that what I did, Dave--
I humiliated you?

1:02:08.791 --> 1:02:12.336
- Oh, my God, I'm sorry.
- Sitting on top of the world.

1:02:12.420 --> 1:02:15.256
Sitting on top of the world--
everything's fucking peach fuzz.

1:02:15.339 --> 1:02:18.551
I don't get a moment to spare
for some bust-out humanitarian

1:02:18.634 --> 1:02:20.428
- down on his luck lately?
- Fuck you!

1:02:20.511 --> 1:02:22.305
Fuck you, Dave--
you know you got a big mouth.

1:02:22.388 --> 1:02:25.600
You make a close, this whole place
stinks with your farts for a week--

1:02:25.683 --> 1:02:30.021
how much you just ingested.
Oh, what a big man you are!

1:02:30.104 --> 1:02:32.773
"Let me buy you a pack of gum--
I'll show you how to chew it."

1:02:32.857 --> 1:02:35.818
Your pal closes, and all that comes
out of your mouth is bile.

1:02:35.901 --> 1:02:39.071
How fucked-up you are!

1:02:39.113 --> 1:02:43.993
Who's my pal, Ricky? Hmm?
And what are you?

1:02:44.076 --> 1:02:47.413
What are you, huh,
Bishop Sheen?

1:02:47.455 --> 1:02:49.582
What the fuck are you,
"Mr. Slick"?

1:02:49.624 --> 1:02:52.251
What the fuck are you,
"Friend to the working man"?

1:02:52.335 --> 1:02:54.712
Big deal!
Fuck you!

1:02:57.006 --> 1:02:59.258
You got the memory
of a fucking fly!

1:03:01.344 --> 1:03:04.263
I never liked you,
anyway.

1:03:04.347 --> 1:03:06.474
What is this,
your farewell speech?

1:03:06.557 --> 1:03:08.935
- I'm going home.
- Your farewell to the troops?

1:03:09.018 --> 1:03:10.853
I'm not going home.
I'm going to Wisconsin.

1:03:10.937 --> 1:03:13.397
- Have a good trip.
- Aw, fuck you!

1:03:14.148 --> 1:03:16.943
Fuck the lot of you!
Fuck you all!

1:03:21.155 --> 1:03:22.949
You were saying?

1:03:23.032 --> 1:03:25.743
Huh?

1:03:25.826 --> 1:03:27.620
Come on.

1:03:27.703 --> 1:03:29.956
Come on-- you got 'em
in the kitchen,

1:03:30.039 --> 1:03:32.667
you're in
your shirtsleeves,

1:03:32.750 --> 1:03:35.044
you got
the stats spread out,

1:03:35.127 --> 1:03:38.381
you can smell it.
Come on, snap out of it.

1:03:38.464 --> 1:03:41.801
- You're eating her crumb cake.
- Oh yeah, I'm eating her crumb cake.

1:03:41.884 --> 1:03:45.012
- How was it?
- From the store.

1:03:45.096 --> 1:03:47.640
- Fuck her.
- "Bruce, Harriett...

1:03:47.723 --> 1:03:51.560
we have to admit to ourselves
that we see that opportunity

1:03:51.644 --> 1:03:55.064
and take it-- and that's it."
Now, we just sit there.

1:03:55.147 --> 1:03:56.941
- I got my pen out.
- "Always Be Closing."

1:03:57.024 --> 1:03:59.527
God, that's what
I've been saying-- the old ways.

1:03:59.610 --> 1:04:03.155
Convert that motherfucker,
sell him, make him sign the check.

1:04:03.239 --> 1:04:05.116
They got their money
in government bonds--

1:04:05.199 --> 1:04:08.786
I said, "Fuck it-- let's go
all the way, the whole route."

1:04:08.869 --> 1:04:13.165
I take it and plat it out-- eight units,
82 grand, and I say to them,

1:04:13.207 --> 1:04:18.337
"This is now. This is that thing
that you have been dreaming of.

1:04:18.379 --> 1:04:20.881
You are going to find
the suitcase on the train.

1:04:20.965 --> 1:04:24.176
The man walks in the room,
that bag is filled with money.

1:04:24.260 --> 1:04:27.805
Harriett, this is it, and Bruce--
I don't want to fuck around with you.

1:04:27.888 --> 1:04:31.058
No, I don't. I don't want
to pussyfoot around.

1:04:31.142 --> 1:04:34.353
You think you got to look back
on this thing? I do, too.

1:04:34.437 --> 1:04:37.898
Now, I'm here to do good
for you and me-- the both of us.

1:04:37.940 --> 1:04:41.235
What is the point
of some interim position?

1:04:41.319 --> 1:04:44.905
The only arrangement
I will accept is full investment.

1:04:44.989 --> 1:04:48.034
And I mean it, that's it--
all eight units. Period."

1:04:48.117 --> 1:04:50.703
Now I got the pen
in my hand, Rick-- hey.

1:04:50.786 --> 1:04:55.625
I turned that contract around--
that's eight units, 82 grand--

1:04:55.708 --> 1:04:59.754
and I said,
"I want you to sign."

1:04:59.837 --> 1:05:02.840
I sat there five minutes.

1:05:02.924 --> 1:05:08.346
Then I sat 22 minutes
by that kitchen clock on the wall.

1:05:08.429 --> 1:05:11.223
Ricky-- not a word,
not a motion.

1:05:11.265 --> 1:05:13.935
And what am I thinking?
"Is my arm getting tired?"

1:05:14.018 --> 1:05:16.854
No. I did it.
Just like the old days,

1:05:16.938 --> 1:05:18.564
like I used to,
like I was taught.

1:05:18.606 --> 1:05:20.733
- I did it.
- Like you taught me.

1:05:20.775 --> 1:05:23.861
Nobody ever--
well, if I did, I'm glad.

1:05:23.945 --> 1:05:25.988
No, what I did--
I locked on 'em.

1:05:26.072 --> 1:05:28.699
I locked all on them--
nothing on me-- on them.

1:05:28.783 --> 1:05:31.869
And, oh God, I am holding
my last thought,

1:05:31.953 --> 1:05:34.580
"Now is the time."

1:05:35.665 --> 1:05:39.252
They signed.
It was great.

1:05:39.335 --> 1:05:42.046
It was so fucking great.

1:05:42.129 --> 1:05:46.008
It was like
they wilted all at once.

1:05:46.092 --> 1:05:48.678
- Mmm.
- No gesture, nothing-- just together.

1:05:48.761 --> 1:05:53.849
Honest to God, they both
imperceptibly slumped.

1:05:53.933 --> 1:05:57.561
And then he reached
and he took the pen and he signed,

1:05:57.603 --> 1:05:59.730
passed it to her
and she signed.

1:05:59.814 --> 1:06:02.066
It was solemn--
fucking solemn.

1:06:02.149 --> 1:06:07.154
I let it sit, and then I nodded.
I said, "Harriett, Bruce,"

1:06:07.238 --> 1:06:09.657
then I pointed into the living room
to the sideboard.

1:06:09.740 --> 1:06:11.951
I didn't know there was
a sideboard in there.

1:06:12.034 --> 1:06:14.036
He went over,
he brought us back a drink--

1:06:14.120 --> 1:06:17.582
little shot glasses
with a pretty design in 'em.

1:06:19.208 --> 1:06:22.837
And we just toasted
in silence.

1:06:22.920 --> 1:06:26.382
Great sale, Shelly.

1:06:26.465 --> 1:06:28.467
Great.

1:06:28.551 --> 1:06:31.470
Fuck! Send me out!
Give me leads!

1:06:31.554 --> 1:06:32.555
- Williamson! Send me out!
- Whoa!

1:06:33.306 --> 1:06:35.266
- The leads are coming.
- Get 'em to me.

1:06:35.349 --> 1:06:38.019
I talked to Mitch and Murray
an hour ago. They're coming in.

1:06:38.102 --> 1:06:40.730
- They're a bit upset over this.
- Did you tell 'em my sale?

1:06:40.813 --> 1:06:43.190
How could I tell 'em your sale?
I didn't have a tele--

1:06:43.482 --> 1:06:45.818
I'll tell 'em your sale
when they bring in the leads.

1:06:45.901 --> 1:06:48.821
We had a little-- you closed the deal,
you made a good sale. Fine.

1:06:48.904 --> 1:06:51.782
- Better than a good sale.
- I have a lot of things on my mind.

1:06:51.866 --> 1:06:55.036
They're coming and they're very upset.
I'm trying to make--

1:06:55.119 --> 1:06:57.872
All I'm telling you is, you can tell
them it was a remarkably good sale.

1:06:57.955 --> 1:07:00.708
The only thing remarkable
about it is who you made it to.

1:07:00.750 --> 1:07:04.211
- What the fuck does that mean?
- If the sale sticks it'll be a miracle.

1:07:04.295 --> 1:07:06.589
"If the sale sticks"?
Why shouldn't the sale stick?

1:07:06.672 --> 1:07:10.676
Oh, fuck you!
You do not know your job.

1:07:10.760 --> 1:07:12.595
Do you know that?
A man is his job!

1:07:12.678 --> 1:07:15.681
You are fucked at yours.
You hear what I'm saying to you?

1:07:15.765 --> 1:07:17.850
Your "End of the Month"
fucking boar--

1:07:17.934 --> 1:07:19.727
you do not know how
to run this office.

1:07:19.769 --> 1:07:22.188
You haven't got the sense.
You haven't got the balls.

1:07:22.271 --> 1:07:25.399
Have you ever been on a sit?
Has this cocksucker been on a sit?

1:07:25.483 --> 1:07:28.235
- Did you ever sit--
- If I were you, I would calm down.

1:07:28.277 --> 1:07:30.237
Would you?
What are you gonna do, fire me?

1:07:30.321 --> 1:07:32.240
Oh, oh, Rick, ooh.

1:07:32.281 --> 1:07:35.576
- It's not impossible.
- Really? On an $80,000 day?

1:07:35.618 --> 1:07:38.079
- It's not even noon yet.
- You closed 'em today?

1:07:38.162 --> 1:07:40.831
I got up early this morning,
tracked 'em down, and closed it.

1:07:40.915 --> 1:07:44.210
What I'm saying to you
is that things change.

1:07:44.293 --> 1:07:47.588
That's where you fuck up.
You don't know. You can't look back.

1:07:47.672 --> 1:07:51.717
You don't see who's coming.
Maybe it's someone new, huh?

1:07:51.801 --> 1:07:53.970
Maybe it's someone else,
but you don't know--

1:07:54.053 --> 1:07:56.722
you can't look back, because
you don't know your history!

1:07:56.764 --> 1:07:59.141
When we were on Rio Rancho,
who was the top man, huh?

1:07:59.225 --> 1:08:01.143
For what,
two months, three months?

1:08:01.227 --> 1:08:04.188
How about eight months,
for three years in a row!

1:08:04.272 --> 1:08:08.025
Luck-- was that it, John?
Or purloined fucking leads?

1:08:08.109 --> 1:08:09.902
- It was talent!
- Yes.

1:08:09.986 --> 1:08:13.531
Door to door.
It's called "cold calling," John.

1:08:13.614 --> 1:08:16.993
Shit, I don't even know their name.
They don't want to buy what I've got.

1:08:17.076 --> 1:08:19.745
Soft sell-- we were doing it
before we had a name for it.

1:08:19.829 --> 1:08:21.706
- Am I right?
- You're right, you're right.

1:08:21.789 --> 1:08:25.626
You wouldn't know, you cock--
he doesn't even know what a streak is.

1:08:25.710 --> 1:08:28.087
What the hell are you?

1:08:28.129 --> 1:08:30.881
You're a fucking secretary.
Fuck you!

1:08:30.965 --> 1:08:34.343
That's my message to you--
fuck you, and kiss my ass.

1:08:34.427 --> 1:08:38.180
If you don't like that, I go across
the street and speak to Jerry Graff.

1:08:38.264 --> 1:08:40.099
Period. Fuck you.

1:08:40.182 --> 1:08:43.352
Listen to me-- you put me
on that fucking board,

1:08:43.436 --> 1:08:45.896
and I want three
promising leads for today,

1:08:45.980 --> 1:08:48.983
I don't want any bullshit,
and I want 'em close together,

1:08:49.066 --> 1:08:51.235
because I am
going to close them all.

1:08:51.319 --> 1:08:54.530
And that's all I have
to say to you.

1:08:55.865 --> 1:08:58.910
He's right, Williamson.

1:09:01.495 --> 1:09:04.790
I'm sorry, but it's wrong,
and you know whose fault it is?

1:09:04.832 --> 1:09:06.417
Mitch and Murray.

1:09:09.003 --> 1:09:11.756
To hell with him.
Let's get some lunch, huh, Rick?

1:09:11.839 --> 1:09:13.966
The leads won't be
up here till later anyway.

1:09:14.091 --> 1:09:17.470
You're a client. I just sold you
five waterfront Glengarry Farms.

1:09:17.553 --> 1:09:20.348
I do this with my hair,
throw me the cue "Kenilworth."

1:09:20.389 --> 1:09:22.850
- Which is it?
- Kenilworth.

1:09:22.892 --> 1:09:25.603
I own the property.
My mother owns the property.

1:09:25.686 --> 1:09:27.438
I put her into it.

1:09:27.521 --> 1:09:30.691
You look on the plats
when you go home. You'll see...

1:09:30.775 --> 1:09:33.527
A-3 through 10,
26 through 30.

1:09:33.569 --> 1:09:37.323
- Take your time. If you still feel--
- I won't need more time, Rick.

1:09:37.406 --> 1:09:39.492
- I've bought a lot of property.
- I've got to talk to you.

1:09:39.575 --> 1:09:41.953
Jim, what are you
doing here?

1:09:42.036 --> 1:09:45.248
Jim Lingk,
D. Ray Morton.

1:09:45.331 --> 1:09:48.376
- I'm glad to meet you.
- I put Jim into Black Creek.

1:09:48.459 --> 1:09:51.337
- Are you acquainted with--
- Black Creek? No.

1:09:51.420 --> 1:09:53.214
- Ooh, in Florida!
- Yes.

1:09:53.297 --> 1:09:56.467
- I meant to speak to you about that.
- We'll do that this weekend.

1:09:56.550 --> 1:09:58.261
My wife suggested
I look into it.

1:09:58.344 --> 1:10:01.097
Beautiful rolling land--
I was telling Jim and Jinny.

1:10:01.180 --> 1:10:04.558
Ray, I got to tell you something.
You eat in a lot of restaurants?

1:10:04.642 --> 1:10:07.520
I know you do.
Ray is with American Express.

1:10:07.561 --> 1:10:09.438
- Can I tell Jim what you do?
- Sure.

1:10:09.522 --> 1:10:12.984
Ray is the director of all
European sales and services--

1:10:13.067 --> 1:10:16.112
what I'm saying is, you haven't had
a meal until you've tasted--

1:10:16.195 --> 1:10:17.989
I was at the Lingks'--

1:10:18.072 --> 1:10:20.533
what was that service feature
you were talking about?

1:10:20.575 --> 1:10:22.285
- Which--
- "Home cooking."

1:10:22.368 --> 1:10:25.204
- You had a tag phrase you used?
- "Cooking"...

1:10:25.246 --> 1:10:26.872
"Home cook--"
the monthly interview.

1:10:26.956 --> 1:10:29.125
- The magazine!
- Yes.

1:10:29.208 --> 1:10:31.544
Is that something
I can talk about?

1:10:31.627 --> 1:10:34.839
It won't be out until
the February issue, but go ahead.

1:10:34.922 --> 1:10:36.549
- Are you sure?
- Go ahead.

1:10:36.632 --> 1:10:39.677
Ray was eating at one of his
company men's homes in France.

1:10:39.760 --> 1:10:41.804
- The man is French?
- No, but his wife is.

1:10:41.887 --> 1:10:43.514
His wife.

1:10:43.598 --> 1:10:46.183
Ray, what time
do you have?

1:10:46.267 --> 1:10:49.061
- 12:15.
- I got to get you on the plane.

1:10:49.103 --> 1:10:50.896
- Didn't I say the 2:00?
- No, the 1:00.

1:10:50.980 --> 1:10:53.899
Remember the 1:00-- that's why
we couldn't talk till Kenilworth.

1:10:53.983 --> 1:10:56.110
You're right, the 1:00--
let's scoot.

1:10:56.193 --> 1:10:58.321
- A pleasure.
- I got to talk to you.

1:10:58.404 --> 1:11:01.490
I got to run Ray to the airport.
Let's hustle-- John!

1:11:01.574 --> 1:11:05.077
Get on the phone to Pittsburgh,
American Express there, for Mr. Morton.

1:11:05.161 --> 1:11:08.456
Tell them he's on the 1:00.
I'll see you.

1:11:08.539 --> 1:11:10.917
Christ, I'm sorry
you came all the way in.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:14.045
I'm running Ray to the airport.
You wait here and--

1:11:14.128 --> 1:11:16.714
no, I can't. I'm meeting your man
at the bank.

1:11:16.797 --> 1:11:20.635
I wish you'd have phoned!
Are you and Jinny going to be home?

1:11:20.718 --> 1:11:22.136
- I don't know.
- Rick?

1:11:22.219 --> 1:11:23.721
- What?
- Kenilworth?

1:11:23.804 --> 1:11:25.514
- I'm sorry?
- Kenilworth.

1:11:25.598 --> 1:11:28.517
Oh, God. Excuse me, Ray--
just a minute.

1:11:28.559 --> 1:11:33.105
Jim, I told you who he is-- the senior
vice-president of American Express.

1:11:33.189 --> 1:11:35.358
His family owns 32 per--

1:11:35.441 --> 1:11:39.320
over the past years, I have sold him--
I can't tell you the dollar amount--

1:11:39.362 --> 1:11:42.031
but quite a lot of land.

1:11:42.114 --> 1:11:45.576
I promised him five weeks ago that I
would go to the wife's birthday party

1:11:45.660 --> 1:11:48.204
in Kenilworth tonight.
I have to go, you understand?

1:11:48.246 --> 1:11:51.332
They treat me like a member
of the family. I have to go.

1:11:51.457 --> 1:11:55.670
It's funny-- you get a picture
of the corporation-type company man,

1:11:55.753 --> 1:11:58.214
all business--
this guy, I'll tell you.

1:11:58.256 --> 1:12:00.216
We'll go to his house
someday.

1:12:00.258 --> 1:12:04.428
Let me see. Tomorrow.
I'm in L.A.?

1:12:04.512 --> 1:12:06.847
Ah, Monday.

1:12:06.931 --> 1:12:09.267
I'll take you to lunch.
Where would you like to eat?

1:12:09.350 --> 1:12:10.768
- My wife--
- Rick?

1:12:10.851 --> 1:12:14.146
I can't talk now, Jim--
I'll call you tonight. Coming, Ray.

1:12:14.230 --> 1:12:16.524
My wife said I have
to cancel the deal.

1:12:18.234 --> 1:12:20.778
That's a common reaction, Jim,
and let me tell you what it is.

1:12:20.861 --> 1:12:23.739
That's why you married her.
One of the reasons is prudence.

1:12:23.781 --> 1:12:26.576
No, it's a sizable investment.
One thinks twice.

1:12:26.617 --> 1:12:31.581
It's also something women have.
Reaction to the size of the investment.

1:12:32.123 --> 1:12:33.916
Monday, you invite me
to dinner again--

1:12:33.958 --> 1:12:35.876
- This woman can cook.
- I'm sure she can.

1:12:35.960 --> 1:12:38.629
We are going to talk.
I want to tell you something.

1:12:38.713 --> 1:12:41.757
Something about your acreage
I want you to know.

1:12:41.841 --> 1:12:45.595
I can't talk about it here,
I really shouldn't, and by law--

1:12:45.678 --> 1:12:50.016
the man next to you--
bought his lot at 42--

1:12:50.099 --> 1:12:52.101
phoned to say
he already had an offer.

1:12:52.184 --> 1:12:53.853
- Rick.
- I'm coming.

1:12:53.936 --> 1:12:56.397
Ray, what a day.
I'll call you this evening.

1:12:56.480 --> 1:12:59.775
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way in. Monday lunch.

1:12:59.859 --> 1:13:01.569
- We have to go.
- Monday!

1:13:01.652 --> 1:13:05.323
She called the consumer--
the attorney general?

1:13:05.406 --> 1:13:07.783
- They said we have three days.
- Who'd she call?

1:13:07.867 --> 1:13:10.953
The attorney ge--
it was some consumer office.

1:13:12.121 --> 1:13:14.457
Why'd she do that, Jim?

1:13:14.498 --> 1:13:16.334
I don't know.

1:13:16.417 --> 1:13:18.252
But they said
we have three days.

1:13:18.336 --> 1:13:21.422
They said
we got three days, yeah.

1:13:21.505 --> 1:13:23.507
Three days?

1:13:23.591 --> 1:13:27.637
- To... you know.
- No, I don't know.

1:13:27.720 --> 1:13:31.265
- Tell me.
- To change our minds.

1:13:31.349 --> 1:13:34.268
Of course you have--
three days.

1:13:34.352 --> 1:13:36.771
So we can't talk Monday.

1:13:36.812 --> 1:13:39.440
Monday--
you saw my book.

1:13:39.523 --> 1:13:42.109
Jim, Jim-- I can't.

1:13:42.193 --> 1:13:44.070
You saw my book.
I can't.

1:13:44.153 --> 1:13:46.197
We have to before Monday
to get our money back.

1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:48.282
Three business days,
they mean.

1:13:48.366 --> 1:13:50.785
- Three business days.
- Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.

1:13:50.868 --> 1:13:54.121
- I don't understand.
- That's what they are, three business--

1:13:54.205 --> 1:13:56.290
if we wait till Monday,
my time limit runs out.

1:13:56.374 --> 1:13:58.459
- You don't count Saturday.
- I'm not.

1:13:58.542 --> 1:14:01.212
I'm saying you don't include
Saturday in the three days.

1:14:01.295 --> 1:14:04.632
- It's not a business day.
- I am not counting it.

1:14:04.715 --> 1:14:09.387
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday--
so it would have elapsed.

1:14:09.470 --> 1:14:11.389
What would have elapsed?

1:14:11.472 --> 1:14:13.224
If we wait till Monday
it would have elapsed!

1:14:13.307 --> 1:14:15.559
- When did you write the check?
- Yesterday.

1:14:15.643 --> 1:14:17.311
- What was yesterday?
- Tuesday.

1:14:17.395 --> 1:14:20.481
- And when was that check cashed?
- I don't know.

1:14:20.564 --> 1:14:22.984
What was the earliest
it could have been cashed?

1:14:22.984 --> 1:14:26.404
- I don't know.
- Today.

1:14:26.445 --> 1:14:29.699
Today. Which, in any case,
it was not--

1:14:29.740 --> 1:14:32.868
there was something on the agreement
I wanted to go over with you.

1:14:32.952 --> 1:14:34.954
It wasn't cashed?

1:14:35.037 --> 1:14:37.206
I just phoned downtown--
it's on their desk.

1:14:37.290 --> 1:14:39.458
- Rick.
- One moment.

1:14:39.542 --> 1:14:42.336
One point, in fact, of which
I spoke to you of which,

1:14:42.420 --> 1:14:44.422
I can't talk to you
about it here.

1:14:44.505 --> 1:14:46.799
- Levene!
- Listen to me.

1:14:46.882 --> 1:14:50.845
The statute is for your protection.
I have no complaint with that.

1:14:50.928 --> 1:14:53.180
In fact, I was a member
of the board when we drafted it.

1:14:53.264 --> 1:14:55.224
So quite the opposite.
It says,

1:14:55.266 --> 1:14:58.019
"You can change your mind
three 'working days'

1:14:58.060 --> 1:14:59.937
from the time
the deal was closed."

1:15:00.021 --> 1:15:01.981
- Levene!
- Wait a second!

1:15:02.064 --> 1:15:04.233
Which is not until
the check is cashed!

1:15:04.275 --> 1:15:07.737
I'm through with this "meshugaas."
Nobody should talk to a man that way.

1:15:07.778 --> 1:15:10.072
- How are you talking to me that way?
- Levene!

1:15:10.156 --> 1:15:13.075
- How can you talk to me that way?
- I'm gonna flag a cab.

1:15:13.159 --> 1:15:16.078
- I didn't rob--
- Shelly, get in the office.

1:15:16.120 --> 1:15:19.248
"Where were you last?"
Is anybody listening to me?

1:15:19.332 --> 1:15:23.085
- Where's Moss?
- Is this Levene?

1:15:23.169 --> 1:15:26.088
Perhaps I could assist you.
Excuse us, will you?

1:15:26.130 --> 1:15:29.634
I work here! I didn't come in here
to be mistreated!

1:15:29.717 --> 1:15:32.386
- Go to lunch, will you?
- That's why I came in to work today.

1:15:32.470 --> 1:15:34.221
The leads come in,
I'll let you know.

1:15:34.263 --> 1:15:36.223
- That's why I came in!
- Just go to lunch.

1:15:36.265 --> 1:15:38.517
- I don't wanna go to lunch!
- Go to lunch, George.

1:15:38.601 --> 1:15:40.519
Where does he get off
talking that way to a working man?

1:15:40.603 --> 1:15:42.730
Take it outside. We have people
trying to do business.

1:15:42.813 --> 1:15:44.941
That's what I came in here for.
That's what I'm trying to do!

1:15:45.024 --> 1:15:47.526
- I meet Gestapo tactics.
- Excuse me.

1:15:47.610 --> 1:15:49.654
I meet Gestapo tactics!

1:15:49.737 --> 1:15:52.031
I meet Gestapo tactics.
That's not right.

1:15:52.073 --> 1:15:57.870
No man has the right--
no man has the right--

1:15:57.954 --> 1:16:02.041
"Call an attorney"--
that means you're under--

1:16:02.083 --> 1:16:04.043
he says, "Cooperate
or we'll take you downtown."

1:16:04.085 --> 1:16:06.087
That's not--
as long as I've--

1:16:06.128 --> 1:16:07.588
Will you get out of here?

1:16:07.630 --> 1:16:10.424
Will you get out of here?
Will you?

1:16:10.466 --> 1:16:13.427
I'm trying to run an office here.
Now, will you go to lunch?

1:16:13.511 --> 1:16:17.723
Go to lunch.
Will you go to lunch?

1:16:31.612 --> 1:16:33.781
- Excuse me.
- Where did Moss...?

1:16:33.864 --> 1:16:36.993
- Excuse me, please?
- Did he go to the restaurant?

1:16:37.076 --> 1:16:39.370
Will you
excuse me, please?

1:16:42.999 --> 1:16:45.543
I'm sorry, I--

1:16:46.961 --> 1:16:50.298
I apologize to you. It's--

1:16:50.381 --> 1:16:52.925
It's not me,
it's my wife.

1:16:55.011 --> 1:16:56.804
What is it?

1:16:56.846 --> 1:16:58.889
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1:16:58.973 --> 1:17:01.851
- What's going on here?
- Tell me again-- your wife?

1:17:01.976 --> 1:17:04.145
- I told you.
- Tell me again.

1:17:04.687 --> 1:17:06.731
She wants her money back.

1:17:06.856 --> 1:17:08.608
We're gonna speak to her.

1:17:08.691 --> 1:17:11.193
No, she told me,
"Right now."

1:17:11.277 --> 1:17:13.654
- We're gonna speak to her, Jim.
- She won't listen.

1:17:13.696 --> 1:17:15.531
- She--
- Roma!

1:17:15.615 --> 1:17:19.160
She said if don't get my money back,
to call the state's attorney.

1:17:19.243 --> 1:17:21.037
No. No.
This is something she said.

1:17:21.078 --> 1:17:23.497
- We don't have to do that.
- She told me I have to.

1:17:23.539 --> 1:17:25.708
- No, Jim.
- I do.

1:17:25.791 --> 1:17:27.501
Listen, I do--
if I don't get my money back--

1:17:27.543 --> 1:17:29.420
Roma,
I'm talking to you.

1:17:29.503 --> 1:17:33.341
Listen-- will someone
get this guy off my back, please?

1:17:33.382 --> 1:17:36.636
- You have a problem?
- Yes, I have a problem!

1:17:36.677 --> 1:17:38.220
Yes, I do, my friend.
It is not me

1:17:38.304 --> 1:17:41.182
that ripped the joint off.
I'm doing business.

1:17:41.223 --> 1:17:44.852
I will be with you
in a while, got it?

1:17:44.936 --> 1:17:48.314
Where are you going?
Where are you going?

1:17:50.608 --> 1:17:52.610
This is me!

1:17:52.693 --> 1:17:56.447
Jim, this is
Ricky, Jim.

1:17:57.823 --> 1:18:01.786
Jim, anything you want,
you want it, you got it.

1:18:01.869 --> 1:18:04.330
Understand?
This is me.

1:18:04.413 --> 1:18:06.874
Something upset you.

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:09.210
Yes.
Sit down now.

1:18:09.293 --> 1:18:13.214
Sit down.
You tell me what it is,

1:18:13.256 --> 1:18:16.634
am I gonna
help you fix it?

1:18:16.717 --> 1:18:18.761
You're goddamned
right I am.

1:18:18.844 --> 1:18:21.347
Sit down.

1:18:21.430 --> 1:18:24.016
I'll tell you something,

1:18:24.100 --> 1:18:28.896
sometimes we need
someone from outside.

1:18:31.857 --> 1:18:34.443
Sit. Talk to me,
come on.

1:18:38.656 --> 1:18:41.325
I can't negotiate.

1:18:42.118 --> 1:18:44.662
What does that mean?

1:18:45.955 --> 1:18:48.416
What?

1:18:50.293 --> 1:18:52.378
What?
Say the words.

1:18:52.461 --> 1:18:55.256
I don't have the power.

1:18:55.298 --> 1:18:57.383
Okay, I said it.

1:18:57.466 --> 1:19:00.886
- What power?
- To negotiate.

1:19:00.970 --> 1:19:02.930
To negotiate what?

1:19:04.974 --> 1:19:07.143
To negotiate what?

1:19:07.226 --> 1:19:09.061
This.

1:19:09.145 --> 1:19:11.230
- What this?
- The deal.

1:19:11.314 --> 1:19:13.190
The deal?

1:19:13.274 --> 1:19:15.234
Forget the deal, Jim.

1:19:15.318 --> 1:19:18.279
You got something on your mind,
what is it?

1:19:18.362 --> 1:19:21.032
What?

1:19:23.326 --> 1:19:25.661
I can't talk to you.

1:19:25.745 --> 1:19:28.164
You met my wife.

1:19:28.247 --> 1:19:31.167
- What?
- Aw...

1:19:33.377 --> 1:19:35.504
I met your wife,
what?

1:19:39.634 --> 1:19:41.928
What, Jim?

1:19:43.971 --> 1:19:46.432
Come on, let's go.
Let's go, let's go.

1:19:46.515 --> 1:19:47.725
Get a drink,
come on.

1:19:47.808 --> 1:19:49.977
No, no, she told me
not to talk to you.

1:19:50.061 --> 1:19:51.938
Come on, we're gonna
go around the corner.

1:19:51.979 --> 1:19:53.564
We'll have a drink.
Who's gonna know?

1:19:53.648 --> 1:19:55.650
She told me to get
the check back, otherwise--

1:19:55.733 --> 1:19:57.777
Forget the deal, Jimmy.
Forget the deal.

1:19:57.818 --> 1:20:01.322
The deal is dead.
You know me, the deal's dead.

1:20:01.405 --> 1:20:03.783
Am I talking
about the deal?

1:20:03.824 --> 1:20:06.202
That's over.

1:20:06.285 --> 1:20:08.955
Please--
let's talk about you.

1:20:15.544 --> 1:20:18.297
I'm gonna tell you
something.

1:20:18.381 --> 1:20:20.675
Your life is your own.

1:20:22.551 --> 1:20:24.720
You have a contract
with your wife,

1:20:24.804 --> 1:20:27.807
you have certain things
you do jointly,

1:20:27.890 --> 1:20:31.060
you have a bond there.
And there are other things,

1:20:31.143 --> 1:20:37.149
and those things are yours.
You needn't feel ashamed.

1:20:37.233 --> 1:20:39.819
You needn't feel
that you're being untrue

1:20:39.860 --> 1:20:44.073
or that she would
abandon you if she knew.

1:20:44.156 --> 1:20:47.326
This is your life.

1:20:52.582 --> 1:20:54.417
Yes?

1:20:57.044 --> 1:21:00.590
Now, I want to talk to you
because you're obviously upset,

1:21:00.673 --> 1:21:03.676
and that concerns me.

1:21:03.759 --> 1:21:06.178
Let's go,
come on, right now.

1:21:06.262 --> 1:21:07.972
Let's go, come on.

1:21:08.055 --> 1:21:10.308
Roma.

1:21:10.391 --> 1:21:13.102
- What?
- The check, it's--

1:21:14.562 --> 1:21:16.731
What did I tell you?

1:21:16.814 --> 1:21:18.691
No, what did I tell you
about the three days?

1:21:18.733 --> 1:21:20.693
Roma, would you?
I'd like to get some lunch.

1:21:21.068 --> 1:21:25.156
I am talking with Mr. Lingk,
if you please.

1:21:25.239 --> 1:21:29.160
I will be with you in a while.
Just check with Mr. Williamson.

1:21:29.243 --> 1:21:33.039
- People downtown said--
- Call them again. Mr. Williamson!

1:21:33.080 --> 1:21:35.166
Yes?

1:21:35.249 --> 1:21:37.293
Mr. Lingk and I
are going to go to the--

1:21:37.376 --> 1:21:40.129
Oh, yes, please.
The police can be--

1:21:40.212 --> 1:21:42.798
- What are the police doing here?
- It's nothing.

1:21:42.882 --> 1:21:46.677
- What are the police doing here?
- We had a slight burglary last night.

1:21:46.719 --> 1:21:48.888
It's nothing,
I was just assuring Mr. Lingk.

1:21:48.971 --> 1:21:51.349
Mr. Lingk? James Lingk?
Your contract went out.

1:21:51.432 --> 1:21:53.309
- Nothing to worry about.
- John, John--

1:21:53.392 --> 1:21:55.186
- Your contract went out to the bank.
- You cashed my check?

1:21:55.269 --> 1:21:57.188
- Mr. Williamson--
- The check was cashed.

1:21:57.271 --> 1:21:59.899
The contract was filed
and deposited in the bank,

1:21:59.941 --> 1:22:02.360
and we're completely insured
in any case, as you know.

1:22:02.443 --> 1:22:06.530
- You cashed the check?
- Not to my knowledge, no.

1:22:06.614 --> 1:22:09.408
- Though I'm sure we can--
- Not to my knowledge.

1:22:09.450 --> 1:22:12.787
Christ! I--
Oh, Christ.

1:22:12.870 --> 1:22:15.289
Don't follow me,
just don't follow me, okay?

1:22:17.917 --> 1:22:20.544
I've let you down.
I know I've let you down.

1:22:20.628 --> 1:22:23.881
I'm sorry, forgive me. I-I--

1:22:25.216 --> 1:22:27.969
I don't--
I don't know anymore.

1:22:29.512 --> 1:22:34.100
I... forgive me.

1:22:48.322 --> 1:22:51.075
You stupid fucking cunt.

1:22:52.451 --> 1:22:54.579
You, Williamson,
I'm talking to you, shithead.

1:22:54.662 --> 1:22:57.290
You just cost me
$6,000.

1:22:57.331 --> 1:23:03.921
$6,000, and one Cadillac.
That's right.

1:23:04.005 --> 1:23:06.340
What are you gonna
do about it?

1:23:06.424 --> 1:23:10.970
What are you
gonna do about it, asshole?

1:23:11.053 --> 1:23:12.972
You're fucking shit.

1:23:13.055 --> 1:23:15.433
Where did you
learn your trade,

1:23:15.516 --> 1:23:18.352
you stupid fucking cunt,
you idiot?

1:23:18.394 --> 1:23:20.813
Who ever told you
that you could work with men?

1:23:20.855 --> 1:23:22.273
Could I...?

1:23:22.315 --> 1:23:24.817
Oh, I'm gonna have
your job, shithead.

1:23:24.859 --> 1:23:27.612
I'm going downtown.
I'm gonna talk to Mitch and Murray.

1:23:27.653 --> 1:23:31.699
I'm going to Lemkin!
I don't care whose nephew you are,

1:23:31.782 --> 1:23:34.785
who you know,
whose dick you're sucking on,

1:23:34.869 --> 1:23:37.204
you're going out.
I swear to you--

1:23:37.288 --> 1:23:39.916
Hey, fella,
let's get this done.

1:23:41.918 --> 1:23:45.421
Anyone in this office
lives on his wits--

1:23:45.504 --> 1:23:48.215
I'm gonna be with you
in a second.

1:23:50.927 --> 1:23:54.597
What you're hired for
is to help us.

1:23:54.680 --> 1:23:57.475
Does that seem
clear to you?

1:23:57.516 --> 1:24:02.396
To help us!
Not to fuck us up!

1:24:02.480 --> 1:24:05.650
To help men who are
going out there

1:24:05.691 --> 1:24:09.195
to try to earn a living,
you fairy.

1:24:09.278 --> 1:24:11.030
You company man.

1:24:11.072 --> 1:24:14.075
I'll tell you something else,
I hope you ripped the joint off.

1:24:14.158 --> 1:24:17.662
I can tell our friend here something,
might help him to catch you.

1:24:22.667 --> 1:24:25.044
You wanna learn
the first rule

1:24:25.086 --> 1:24:28.089
you'd know if you ever
spent a day in your life?

1:24:28.172 --> 1:24:33.552
You never open your mouth
till you know what the shot is.

1:24:35.388 --> 1:24:38.099
You fucking child.

1:24:50.361 --> 1:24:53.489
You are a shithead,
Williamson.

1:24:55.366 --> 1:24:58.494
Can't think on your feet,
you ought to keep your mouth closed.

1:24:58.578 --> 1:25:01.747
Can you hear me?
I'm talking to you.

1:25:01.789 --> 1:25:03.624
Yes, I hear you.

1:25:03.708 --> 1:25:06.836
Ricky's right. Can't learn in an office,
gotta learn it in the street.

1:25:06.919 --> 1:25:09.130
And you sure can't buy it,
you gotta live it.

1:25:09.171 --> 1:25:11.173
- Mmmm.
- "Mmmm," yeah!

1:25:11.257 --> 1:25:14.510
Precisely.
Because your partner depends--

1:25:14.594 --> 1:25:16.512
I'm talking to you,
trying to tell you something!

1:25:16.596 --> 1:25:17.638
- You are?
- Yeah, I am.

1:25:17.722 --> 1:25:20.141
- What are you trying to tell me?
- What Roma was trying to tell you.

1:25:20.224 --> 1:25:23.561
What I told you a long time ago.
You don't belong in this business.

1:25:23.603 --> 1:25:25.896
You might listen to me.
One day you could say,

1:25:25.938 --> 1:25:27.648
"Hey, maybe the guy--"
oh, fuck it.

1:25:27.732 --> 1:25:30.735
Listen to me now.
Your partner depends on you.

1:25:30.776 --> 1:25:33.362
The man who is your partner,
depends on you.

1:25:33.446 --> 1:25:36.407
You go with him
and for him or you're shit!

1:25:36.449 --> 1:25:38.701
You are shit--
you can't exist alone.

1:25:38.784 --> 1:25:40.620
- Excuse me.
- "Excuse you," nothing!

1:25:40.661 --> 1:25:43.789
You be as cold as you want.
You just fucked a good man

1:25:43.873 --> 1:25:45.917
out of $6,000
and his goddamned bonus

1:25:46.000 --> 1:25:48.085
because you didn't
know the shot.

1:25:48.169 --> 1:25:50.463
You can do that and you're not
man enough to say it gets you?

1:25:50.504 --> 1:25:53.466
I don't know what--
if you can't take something from that,

1:25:53.549 --> 1:25:56.385
then you're-- scum!
You're fucking white bread.

1:25:56.469 --> 1:25:59.472
A child would know it,
he's right.

1:25:59.555 --> 1:26:02.767
If you're gonna make something up,
be sure that it helps.

1:26:02.808 --> 1:26:05.811
Hmm?
Or keep your mouth shut.

1:26:05.853 --> 1:26:08.648
I'm done with you.

1:26:21.202 --> 1:26:22.787
How do you know
I made it up?

1:26:22.870 --> 1:26:25.206
What?

1:26:25.289 --> 1:26:28.209
How do you know
I made it up?

1:26:28.292 --> 1:26:30.795
What are you
talking about, huh?

1:26:33.464 --> 1:26:36.509
You said, "Don't make something up
unless it's sure to help."

1:26:38.552 --> 1:26:43.182
- How did you know I made it up?
- What are you talking about?

1:26:50.481 --> 1:26:53.234
I told the customer his contract
had gone to the bank.

1:26:53.317 --> 1:26:55.528
Yeah. Well, hadn't it?

1:26:59.240 --> 1:27:01.200
No, it hadn't.

1:27:03.786 --> 1:27:05.454
Don't fuck with me.

1:27:05.538 --> 1:27:07.957
Don't fuck with me!
What are you getting at?

1:27:08.040 --> 1:27:10.793
I'm saying this, Shelly...

1:27:13.296 --> 1:27:15.923
usually I take
the contracts to the bank,

1:27:16.007 --> 1:27:18.259
last night I didn't.

1:27:19.677 --> 1:27:22.805
Last night I stayed home
with my kids.

1:27:24.807 --> 1:27:27.184
How did you know that?

1:27:29.228 --> 1:27:34.025
One night in a year,
I left a contract on my desk.

1:27:34.150 --> 1:27:36.569
No one knew that but you.

1:27:37.862 --> 1:27:39.614
Now, how did you know that?

1:27:39.697 --> 1:27:43.284
You want to talk to me or you
want to talk to someone else?

1:27:43.367 --> 1:27:44.827
Because this is my job!

1:27:44.911 --> 1:27:48.748
This is my job on the line
and you are gonna talk to me!

1:27:48.831 --> 1:27:51.834
Now how did you know
that contract was on my desk?

1:27:51.918 --> 1:27:54.462
You are so full of shit!

1:27:54.545 --> 1:27:56.881
- You robbed the office.
- Oh, sure, I robbed the office.

1:27:56.923 --> 1:27:59.050
Oh sure! You asshole.

1:27:59.133 --> 1:28:00.968
What did you do
with the leads?

1:28:01.052 --> 1:28:03.763
You wanna go in there?
I tell him what I know,

1:28:03.804 --> 1:28:06.474
he's gonna dig up something.
You got an alibi last night?

1:28:06.557 --> 1:28:09.936
You better have one!
What did you do with the leads?

1:28:10.019 --> 1:28:13.189
If you tell me what you did
with the leads, we can talk.

1:28:13.272 --> 1:28:15.608
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

1:28:15.650 --> 1:28:18.027
If you tell me where the leads are,
I won't turn you in.

1:28:18.110 --> 1:28:20.488
If you don't, I'm gonna tell
the cop you stole them.

1:28:20.571 --> 1:28:23.699
Mitch and Murray will see that you
go to jail, believe me, they will!

1:28:23.783 --> 1:28:25.201
Now, where are the leads?

1:28:25.284 --> 1:28:27.328
I'm walking in that door.
You got five seconds

1:28:27.411 --> 1:28:29.038
- or you are going to jail!
- Go ahead.

1:28:29.121 --> 1:28:31.582
I don't care,
you understand?

1:28:32.792 --> 1:28:35.336
Where are the leads?

1:28:36.754 --> 1:28:38.839
All right.

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:42.760
I sold them.

1:28:51.727 --> 1:28:54.230
To Jerry Graff.

1:28:54.313 --> 1:28:56.607
How much did you
get for them?

1:28:56.649 --> 1:28:58.526
How much did
you get for them?

1:28:58.609 --> 1:29:00.945
Five.
Five grand.

1:29:00.987 --> 1:29:03.864
- I got half.
- Who got the other half?

1:29:03.948 --> 1:29:05.950
Do I have to tell you?

1:29:05.992 --> 1:29:08.536
Moss.

1:29:12.123 --> 1:29:14.166
Well, that was easy,
wasn't it?

1:29:14.250 --> 1:29:16.752
- His idea.
- Was it?

1:29:16.836 --> 1:29:19.088
I think he got
more than five, actually.

1:29:19.130 --> 1:29:22.466
- Uh-huh.
- He told me my cut was 2500.

1:29:22.508 --> 1:29:24.760
Mmm.

1:29:26.304 --> 1:29:27.972
Wait a minute.
Okay-- hey, hey, John!

1:29:28.014 --> 1:29:31.225
Wait-- okay, John!
Hey, Johnny.

1:29:31.309 --> 1:29:34.812
Listen.
Come here, come here.

1:29:36.981 --> 1:29:38.733
Eh, John?

1:29:38.816 --> 1:29:41.068
Last night...

1:29:41.152 --> 1:29:43.821
I gotta tell you,
I'm ready to "do the Dutch."

1:29:43.863 --> 1:29:46.824
I'm done. Moss gets me,
"Do this, we'll get well."

1:29:46.866 --> 1:29:50.161
Why not? Big fucking deal.
I'm halfway hoping to get caught.

1:29:50.244 --> 1:29:54.373
Hey-- put me out of my misery.
It taught me something, John.

1:29:54.457 --> 1:29:56.918
What it taught me--
you gotta get out there!

1:29:57.001 --> 1:30:00.338
I'm not cut out to be a thief,
I'm cut out to be a salesman.

1:30:00.504 --> 1:30:03.215
And I am back.
I got my balls back.

1:30:03.341 --> 1:30:07.261
Now... you got a slight
advantage on me.

1:30:07.386 --> 1:30:09.972
But whatever it takes, John,

1:30:10.056 --> 1:30:12.558
to make things right,
we're gonna make it right.

1:30:12.642 --> 1:30:15.227
We are going
to make it right.

1:30:18.648 --> 1:30:20.441
I want to tell you
something, Shelly.

1:30:20.524 --> 1:30:24.195
- Eh?
- You have a big mouth.

1:30:24.237 --> 1:30:26.781
What?

1:30:26.864 --> 1:30:28.574
You've got a big mouth!

1:30:28.616 --> 1:30:31.369
And now I'm gonna show you
an even bigger one.

1:30:31.410 --> 1:30:33.287
Where are you going?

1:30:33.371 --> 1:30:36.082
You can't do that!
You don't want to do that.

1:30:36.165 --> 1:30:38.417
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

1:30:40.169 --> 1:30:43.673
It's $2,500. Go ahead
and take it, take it all.

1:30:43.756 --> 1:30:46.092
No, I don't think so.
I don't think I want your money.

1:30:46.175 --> 1:30:49.095
I think you fucked up my office,
and I think you're going away.

1:30:49.136 --> 1:30:53.099
Are you nuts?
I'm gonna close for you! Take--

1:30:53.140 --> 1:30:56.602
I'm gonna make this office and be
number one on that board again.

1:30:56.644 --> 1:30:58.938
Wait, John.

1:30:59.021 --> 1:31:02.525
John-- okay.

1:31:05.319 --> 1:31:09.699
This is what
we're gonna do-- 20%.

1:31:09.740 --> 1:31:12.952
I'm gonna give you 20%
of all my sales.

1:31:13.035 --> 1:31:15.955
20%, as long as I'm
with this firm.

1:31:16.038 --> 1:31:18.040
50.

1:31:18.124 --> 1:31:22.587
- 50%of all my sales.
- What sales?

1:31:22.628 --> 1:31:24.797
What sales? My God,
I just closed 82 grand.

1:31:24.880 --> 1:31:28.009
Are you out of your fucking mind?
I'm back! This is just the beginning!

1:31:28.092 --> 1:31:30.553
Just the beginning?
Where have you been, Shelly?

1:31:30.595 --> 1:31:33.598
Bruce and Harriett Nyborg--
do you want to see the memos?

1:31:33.639 --> 1:31:37.226
They're nuts.
They used to call in every week--

1:31:37.310 --> 1:31:39.854
when I was with Webb--
we were selling Arizona.

1:31:39.937 --> 1:31:41.981
They're nuts.

1:31:42.064 --> 1:31:47.445
Did you see how they were living?
How can you delude yourself?

1:31:47.486 --> 1:31:49.447
- I've got their check.
- Forget it. Frame it.

1:31:49.530 --> 1:31:51.741
- It's worthless.
- The check is no good?

1:31:51.782 --> 1:31:54.160
You want to stick around?
I'll pull the memo. I'm busy.

1:31:54.243 --> 1:31:56.120
The check is no good?
They're nuts?

1:31:56.203 --> 1:31:58.039
You want to call the bank?
I called them.

1:31:58.122 --> 1:32:01.792
I called them four months ago
when we first got the lead.

1:32:01.834 --> 1:32:04.629
The people are insane.

1:32:06.088 --> 1:32:09.508
They just like talking
to salesmen.

1:32:14.513 --> 1:32:18.768
- Don't!
- I'm sorry.

1:32:21.354 --> 1:32:25.316
- Why?
- Because I don't like you.

1:32:32.073 --> 1:32:34.075
My daughter.

1:32:34.158 --> 1:32:36.327
Fuck you.

1:32:51.550 --> 1:32:53.928
Asshole.

1:32:54.011 --> 1:32:57.181
Guy couldn't find his fucking couch
in the living room.

1:32:59.350 --> 1:33:01.727
What a day.

1:33:01.811 --> 1:33:03.813
Whoo...

1:33:03.896 --> 1:33:06.315
I haven't even had
a cup of coffee.

1:33:09.860 --> 1:33:13.531
Jag-off John opens his mouth,
blows my Cadillac.

1:33:16.033 --> 1:33:19.620
I swear,
it's not a world of men.

1:33:22.123 --> 1:33:24.834
It is not
a world of men, "Machine."

1:33:24.875 --> 1:33:27.712
- Huh?
- It's a world of clock-watchers...

1:33:27.753 --> 1:33:30.381
bureaucrats...

1:33:30.464 --> 1:33:33.217
officeholders, what it is.

1:33:34.260 --> 1:33:36.554
It's a fucked-up world.

1:33:38.889 --> 1:33:40.891
No adventure to it.

1:33:40.933 --> 1:33:45.229
Dying breed.
Yes, it is.

1:33:46.898 --> 1:33:50.651
We're the members of a dying breed.
That's-- that's--

1:33:50.735 --> 1:33:54.488
that's why we got
to stick together. Shel?

1:33:54.572 --> 1:33:56.908
- Huh?
- I want to talk to you.

1:33:56.991 --> 1:33:59.285
I've wanted to talk to you
for some time--

1:33:59.368 --> 1:34:03.247
for a long time, actually.
I said, "The Machine"--

1:34:03.331 --> 1:34:06.751
there's a man
I would work with.

1:34:06.792 --> 1:34:10.546
There's--" you know,
I never said a word.

1:34:10.588 --> 1:34:13.549
I don't know why I didn't.
I should've, I don't know why.

1:34:13.591 --> 1:34:17.428
And that shit you were slinging
on my guy today--

1:34:17.511 --> 1:34:21.682
that was so good.
That-- it--

1:34:21.766 --> 1:34:24.560
excuse me for saying this,
it's not even my place to say it.

1:34:24.602 --> 1:34:27.188
That was admirable.

1:34:27.271 --> 1:34:29.941
It was the old stuff.

1:34:29.982 --> 1:34:33.569
Hey, I've been
on a hot streak.

1:34:33.611 --> 1:34:37.365
So what?
Things I can learn from you.

1:34:39.450 --> 1:34:41.619
- You eat today?
- Me?

1:34:41.702 --> 1:34:43.204
Yeah.

1:34:43.287 --> 1:34:46.624
Want to swing around the Chinks'--
watch me eat, we'll talk?

1:34:46.707 --> 1:34:49.043
I think
I'll stay around awhile.

1:34:49.126 --> 1:34:51.087
Hello, Mrs. Schwartz?

1:34:51.128 --> 1:34:53.256
This is Richard Roma
with Premiere Properties.

1:34:53.297 --> 1:34:56.259
You or your accountant requested
information on a land investment

1:34:56.300 --> 1:34:58.928
which would offer you
depreciation and the chance

1:34:58.970 --> 1:35:01.180
of a substantial return
on a small investment.

1:35:01.264 --> 1:35:03.683
I'm in from Florida
just for one day...

1:35:03.766 --> 1:35:07.603
- Mr. Levene?
- ...so I only have that one lot left.

1:35:07.645 --> 1:35:09.480
Would you come in here,
please?

1:35:09.564 --> 1:35:11.941
I don't have too much time
and I'm on the midnight plane back,

1:35:11.983 --> 1:35:14.485
so if you or your husband
are truly interested--

1:35:14.485 --> 1:35:16.988
because I can't hold
this parcel past--

1:35:17.029 --> 1:35:19.574
Yes?

1:35:19.657 --> 1:35:22.618
Well, what would be better
for you-- say, 6:00 or 8:00?

1:35:23.995 --> 1:35:28.124
Go ask him. Shel-- we're gonna talk?
I'm going to the Chinks'.

1:35:28.207 --> 1:35:30.167
When you're done, come down.
We're gonna smoke a cigarette.

1:35:30.209 --> 1:35:32.336
- I...
- Get in the room.

1:35:32.420 --> 1:35:36.340
Hey. Hey, easy, pal.
That's "The Machine."

1:35:36.382 --> 1:35:39.427
This is Shelly
"The Machine" Levene.

1:35:39.510 --> 1:35:41.846
- Get in the goddamn room.
- Rick, I...

1:35:41.929 --> 1:35:44.098
- I'll meet you at the restaurant.
- Ricky--

1:35:44.181 --> 1:35:46.017
- Ricky can't help you.
- All I want is--

1:35:46.100 --> 1:35:48.144
What do you want?
You want to what?

1:35:48.227 --> 1:35:52.148
- Rick? Rick?
- Hello? Excellent.

1:35:58.321 --> 1:35:58.404
8:00 p.m.
6947 Euclid.

1:35:58.487 --> 1:36:01.198
Not at all--
thank you very much.

1:36:11.876 --> 1:36:15.129
They find the guy
that broke in the office?

1:36:15.212 --> 1:36:18.382
No. I don't know.

1:36:23.220 --> 1:36:25.306
Did the leads
come in yet?

1:36:25.389 --> 1:36:27.850
No.

1:36:35.733 --> 1:36:38.027
Oh God,
I hate this job.

1:36:38.069 --> 1:36:40.196
Anybody wants me,
I'm at the restaurant.

1:36:45.743 --> 1:36:48.579
Hello, Mrs. Delgari?

1:36:48.621 --> 1:36:51.874
Yes-- you requested some information
about Rio Rancho Properties?

1:36:51.958 --> 1:36:56.671
