25:20.078 --> 25:21.778
What do you mean?

25:21.813 --> 25:23.180
O.S.P.
was a paperless office,

25:23.214 --> 25:25.115
but not
in the environmental sense.

25:25.150 --> 25:26.583
Jai wanted everything
off book.

25:26.617 --> 25:28.252
Any files that did come
through here

25:28.286 --> 25:29.620
had a complex encryption code.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.455
All right, ballpark,
how many active operations

25:31.489 --> 25:33.190
are we talking about--
eight, ten?

25:33.225 --> 25:35.125
More like 50.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.725
Okay, you know
you've been dying to talk to me,

28:44.759 --> 28:45.993
so here's your chance.

28:46.027 --> 28:48.028
I'm gonna bounce something
off of you.

28:48.063 --> 28:49.997
Auggie, now is
not a really great time.

28:50.031 --> 28:52.333
No, it's not, I can hear it
in your voice--what's going on?

28:52.367 --> 28:55.336
Uh, I'm just winded
from running--jogging.

28:55.370 --> 28:58.239
Are you sure there's nothing
I can help you with?

28:58.273 --> 29:01.041
No, I-I got to go.

29:01.076 --> 29:03.211
Okay, but call me back
when you can.

29:03.245 --> 29:06.180
Okay. Bye.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.893
Abdul get you what you needed?

29:17.928 --> 29:21.564
Yeah, he did, but, um,
Simon's late for our meeting,

29:21.598 --> 29:23.132
and I was tailed in the souk

29:23.167 --> 29:25.001
by the two German tourists
we saw earlier.

29:25.035 --> 29:26.002
They had guns.

29:26.036 --> 29:29.506
They move like professionals.

29:29.540 --> 29:31.208
Putting protocol aside,

29:31.242 --> 29:34.477
what do you feel?

29:34.512 --> 29:37.681
I'd like to play this out.
I think I can make it work.

29:37.715 --> 29:40.517
- Then make it work.
- Okay.

29:40.552 --> 29:43.053
Thanks.

[Chuckles]

29:47.760 --> 29:49.994
I'm a ridiculous cliche--
beyond late.

29:50.028 --> 29:51.162
I'm so sorry.

29:51.196 --> 29:53.197
That, that's okay.
I just got here.

29:53.231 --> 29:55.333
You weren't at the cafe.

The car's
just around the corner.

30:05.711 --> 30:07.712
You fixed it that fast?

30:07.746 --> 30:09.246
I bought a new one.

30:09.281 --> 30:11.613
Don't worry.
I mean, it was time.

30:11.647 --> 30:14.248
I wasn't worried.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.424
Got to love
that new-car smell.

with an almond.

31:08.953 --> 31:12.656
The date's are "halawi."

31:12.691 --> 31:15.492
That means "beauty" in arabic.

31:15.526 --> 31:18.995
In fact, in ancient times, only
females of spectacular beauty

31:19.030 --> 31:21.597
were allowed to eat
this particular date--

31:21.632 --> 31:24.000
women such as yourself.

31:24.034 --> 31:25.668
Bullshit.

31:25.702 --> 31:27.403
"Halawi" means "sweet."

31:42.020 --> 31:46.123
Hey, figured I'd make
some space for the new guy.

31:46.157 --> 31:47.958
There will never be
a new guy--

just the person who isn't you.

a different place in mind.

I have to say,
if you asked me last week,

33:55.086 --> 33:57.754
I certainly didn't see myself
in a place like this.

of Kidal, Gao, and Timbuktu.

will run out of petroleum
