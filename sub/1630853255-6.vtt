18:16.396 --> 18:20.198
I just spoke to some
of the brothers up in oakland.

18:20.233 --> 18:23.501
The fuckers who rolled up--
they weren't wearing kuttes,

18:23.536 --> 18:25.470
but they were recognized as soa.

18:25.505 --> 18:27.705
How sure are you?

18:27.740 --> 18:30.508
One hundred percent.

18:30.543 --> 18:31.943
Fuck.

18:31.978 --> 18:33.611
Didn't even hide their faces.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.513
It's like
they wanted us to know.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.882
You tell anyone else?

18:39.385 --> 18:40.952
No.

18:42.021 --> 18:44.088
Keep that between us, huh?

18:46.192 --> 18:47.492
You know, once the brothers hear

18:47.527 --> 18:49.093
about this,
they're gonna want blood.

18:49.129 --> 18:51.095
Striking back blind
isn't the answer, hank.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.164
We need to know
what's behind this.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.699
I mean, shit.
We're still recovering

18:54.734 --> 18:56.367
from a fucking civil war.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.569
We can't just jump
into a conflict with the sons.

19:00.073 --> 19:02.673
What kind of message
does it send

19:02.709 --> 19:04.275
if we don't hit back?

19:07.881 --> 19:10.414
We need answers.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.916
Then we'll move.

19:15.255 --> 19:17.421

to get his own hands dirty.

21:06.165 --> 21:07.698

21:12.138 --> 21:14.272
Everybody's so eager
to go to war.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.644
But after all the funerals,

21:19.679 --> 21:23.414
the old ladies, the kids,

21:23.449 --> 21:27.118
you sometimes forget
why it even started.

21:29.188 --> 21:31.188
'92, cali patch.

21:31.224 --> 21:33.291
Two years of death.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.794
Every day, getting on this bike,
never knowing

21:36.829 --> 21:39.497
if that ride would be your last.
And for what?

21:49.575 --> 21:51.575
I mean, at the end of the day,

21:51.611 --> 21:53.978
what do we have to show for it?

21:54.013 --> 21:56.047
Nothing.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.382
Except death
over a fucking piece of cloth.

22:05.258 --> 22:09.527
The brothers got angry,
but we pulled back.

22:09.562 --> 22:12.430
Now we wear so cal,
nor cal patches.

22:13.933 --> 22:16.067

I don't got the luxury of seeing
things black and white, ez.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.749
I don't got the luxury
of emotions.

22:34.620 --> 22:37.355
Now, coco...

22:37.390 --> 22:39.724
Coco's death is on me.

22:39.759 --> 22:43.527
I sent him up there,
and I'll always carry that.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.363

22:45.398 --> 22:48.699

22:48.735 --> 22:50.735
