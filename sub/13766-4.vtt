WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:04.045
(trumpet plays)

00:06.089 --> 00:08.467
We're gathered here today

00:06.089 --> 00:08.467
to say good-bye

00:08.509 --> 00:09.677
to Jumpy

00:08.509 --> 00:09.677
number eight.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.678
Nine...

00:10.719 --> 00:11.846
Nine.

00:11.887 --> 00:13.555
He was a good...

00:13.597 --> 00:15.432
Nine?

00:15.474 --> 00:16.558
Are you sure, nine?

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
Anyway, he was

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
a very good frog.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.649
And he led

00:21.146 --> 00:23.649
a very full life.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.902
I remember when I stuck him

00:23.691 --> 00:26.902
in Mom's sun visor,

00:26.944 --> 00:29.446
and she almost hit that lady

00:26.944 --> 00:29.446
in the crosswalk.

00:29.488 --> 00:31.323
It was hysterical.

00:31.365 --> 00:33.951
Farewell, Jumpy number nine.

00:33.993 --> 00:36.954
We know you're going

00:33.993 --> 00:36.954
to a better place.

00:36.996 --> 00:39.999
Bye, Jumpy.

00:43.794 --> 00:45.838
Dad...

00:47.756 --> 00:49.048
(trumpet plays)

00:55.389 --> 00:56.932
(rocket pops)

00:57.933 --> 00:59.309
May he rest

00:57.933 --> 00:59.309
in pieces.

00:59.351 --> 01:01.102
Amen.

Kenarban...

01:39.349 --> 01:40.809
winds up.

01:43.186 --> 01:44.396
Bases loaded.

01:46.189 --> 01:49.150
Series on...

01:49.192 --> 01:50.235
the line.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.863
Will you just throw the ball?

01:52.905 --> 01:55.741
Aah!

01:55.783 --> 01:57.158
Want me to...

01:57.200 --> 01:58.493
kiss it?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.212
Oh, man, Kevin.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.756
I hate this guy.

02:10.798 --> 02:12.591
He's only been here

02:10.798 --> 02:12.591
for two weeks,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.594
and he's already the most

02:12.633 --> 02:15.594
obnoxious kid in the school.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.178
Little help.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.597
Lose your

02:17.220 --> 02:18.597
ball-ey, baby?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.265
Can I please have

02:18.639 --> 02:20.265
my ball back, Kevin?

02:20.307 --> 02:22.017
"Can I please have

02:20.307 --> 02:22.017
my ball back, Kevin?"

02:22.059 --> 02:24.394
Come on, Kevin.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.394
"Come on, Kevin."

02:24.436 --> 02:27.188
De gustibus

02:24.436 --> 02:27.188
non est disputandum.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.440
De kub...

02:28.482 --> 02:29.566
You stink!

02:29.608 --> 02:31.110
Your new name

02:29.608 --> 02:31.110
is Stinky.

02:31.151 --> 02:32.778
Whatever, just give me

02:31.151 --> 02:32.778
my ball back.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.113
You want it?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.156
Go get it, Stinky.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.913
SPANGLER:

02:41.411 --> 02:42.913
Men, most of you are at an age

02:42.955 --> 02:44.832
where your bodies

02:42.955 --> 02:44.832
have undergone

02:44.873 --> 02:46.917
significant changes.

02:46.959 --> 02:50.712
While the benefits

02:46.959 --> 02:50.712
of increased muscle mass

02:50.754 --> 02:53.841
and a more authoritative

02:50.754 --> 02:53.841
speaking register are plain,

02:53.882 --> 02:57.469
these changes can

02:53.882 --> 02:57.469
produce certain...

02:57.511 --> 02:59.429
negative desires.

02:59.471 --> 03:02.141
Uh, we used to handle it

02:59.471 --> 03:02.141
with cold showers

03:02.181 --> 03:04.434
and regularly scheduled

03:02.181 --> 03:04.434
beatings,

03:04.476 --> 03:07.395
but, sadly, times have changed,

03:07.437 --> 03:10.231
and I am forced to rely

03:07.437 --> 03:10.231
on a less effective option:

03:10.273 --> 03:12.567
education.

03:15.278 --> 03:17.114
Pretty, isn't she? Hmm?

03:17.156 --> 03:19.033
Perhaps her name is Mary

03:19.074 --> 03:22.243
or Wendy or Becky Lou--

03:19.074 --> 03:22.243
it doesn't matter

03:22.285 --> 03:25.956
because her real name

03:22.285 --> 03:25.956
is disease.

03:28.792 --> 03:30.335
Not so pretty anymore,

03:28.792 --> 03:30.335
is she, men?

03:30.377 --> 03:32.462
Cankers...

03:32.504 --> 03:34.548
lesions...

03:34.589 --> 03:37.425
furuncles.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.095
Such is the price of weakness.

03:40.137 --> 03:43.057
I can't believe

03:40.137 --> 03:43.057
they're swallowing this.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.683
Standard technique.

03:44.725 --> 03:47.268
Generate a fear response,

03:44.725 --> 03:47.268
make the brain more receptive.

03:47.310 --> 03:48.478
I don't care.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.313
Spangler has ruined

03:48.520 --> 03:50.313
everything in our lives.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
Now he has

03:50.355 --> 03:52.273
to ruin sex?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.275
Now, remember,

03:52.315 --> 03:54.275
every one of these diseases

03:54.317 --> 03:57.237
can easily be

03:54.317 --> 03:57.237
transmitted to you.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.448
(groaning)

04:00.490 --> 04:02.076
MAN:

04:00.490 --> 04:02.076
Excuse me, sir?

04:02.117 --> 04:04.327
Isn't that slide upside down?

04:04.369 --> 04:05.370
No, son.

04:05.412 --> 04:07.581
No, it isn't.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.668
(Dewey groans, cries)

04:09.332 --> 04:11.668
HAL: Okay, pal, all right.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.170
I'll get

04:11.710 --> 04:13.170
the ice pack.

04:13.212 --> 04:15.172
Dewey, we told you to stop

04:13.212 --> 04:15.172
climbing that tree.

04:15.214 --> 04:16.215
It's too big.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.550
I couldn't help it.

04:18.592 --> 04:19.509
I know,

04:18.592 --> 04:19.509
sweetheart.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.762
That's it,

04:19.551 --> 04:21.762
I've had it.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.304
That sucker's

04:21.803 --> 04:23.304
coming down.

04:23.346 --> 04:24.890
You're gonna

04:23.346 --> 04:24.890
cut down the tree?

04:24.932 --> 04:26.100
Darn right.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.392
I'm sick and tired

04:26.141 --> 04:27.392
of raking leaves

04:27.434 --> 04:28.894
and hosing bird

04:27.434 --> 04:28.894
poop off our car.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.395
And seeing that weird

04:28.936 --> 04:30.395
face in the bark

04:30.437 --> 04:32.022
that follows you

04:30.437 --> 04:32.022
wherever you go.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.357
And now it's going

04:32.064 --> 04:34.357
after the children?

04:34.399 --> 04:35.943
No, Lois, it has

04:34.399 --> 04:35.943
to be stopped.

04:35.984 --> 04:38.195
Can I help kill it?

04:38.237 --> 04:39.404
Sure, sweetheart.

04:39.446 --> 04:40.864
We'll take turns.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.331
All right, frozen pizza.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.666
The only thing

04:50.373 --> 04:51.666
Rowena can't ruin.

04:52.793 --> 04:53.961
Hey, no cuts.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.754
"Hey, no cuts."

04:55.796 --> 04:57.798
Two slices, please.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.009
Is there any

04:59.591 --> 05:01.009
more pizza?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.928
No, all out.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.097
It's American goulash

05:02.970 --> 05:05.097
for you.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.396
What... is that?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.356
I don't know.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.651
All I can identify are little

05:15.398 --> 05:17.651
pieces of carrot and...

05:17.692 --> 05:20.528
I don't know, I think

05:17.692 --> 05:20.528
they're Skittles.

05:20.570 --> 05:23.364
Hey, look at the

05:20.570 --> 05:23.364
goulash boy.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.866
Get away from me, Kevin.

05:24.908 --> 05:27.410
Ooh, "Get away

05:24.908 --> 05:27.410
from me, Kevin."

05:27.452 --> 05:30.247
He's so sad that he

05:27.452 --> 05:30.247
doesn't have pizza,

05:30.289 --> 05:31.873
and I do.

05:31.915 --> 05:33.959
I said get away.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.171
Chill... man.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.588
I got...

05:38.630 --> 05:40.215
your back.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.551
What are you looking

05:41.675 --> 05:43.551
at, Kenar-butt?

05:43.593 --> 05:45.679
Light...

05:45.720 --> 05:47.639
some shadows.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.432
Kevin,

05:47.681 --> 05:49.432
I'm warning you.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.392
Get out of my face.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.562
Aw, Malcolm doesn't like me

05:51.434 --> 05:54.562
eating close to his face

05:54.604 --> 05:59.151
with pizza I have

05:54.604 --> 05:59.151
and he doesn't.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.779
Pizza, pizza, pizza.

06:02.821 --> 06:05.032
(echoing):

06:02.821 --> 06:05.032
Pizza...

06:05.073 --> 06:08.160
(echoing):

06:05.073 --> 06:08.160
Pizza...

06:10.120 --> 06:12.956
Pizza...

06:20.463 --> 06:22.423
(heart pounding)

06:29.472 --> 06:30.431
You want pizza?

06:30.473 --> 06:31.432
I'll give you pizza.

06:34.353 --> 06:36.897
(chanting): Fight! Fight!

06:34.353 --> 06:36.897
Fight! Fight!

06:36.938 --> 06:39.066
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

06:40.942 --> 06:43.444
Wow, watching hockey has

06:40.942 --> 06:43.444
really paid off.

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
I can't believe

06:43.486 --> 06:45.446
how good I'm doing.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.656
(crying)

06:46.698 --> 06:48.909
What do you mean

06:46.698 --> 06:48.909
he's only seven?

06:48.950 --> 06:50.702
What's not

06:48.950 --> 06:50.702
to understand?

06:50.744 --> 06:52.329
He just

06:50.744 --> 06:52.329
turned seven.

06:52.371 --> 06:54.956
I guess you were too busy

06:52.371 --> 06:54.956
beating people to notice.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.625
He can't be seven--

06:54.998 --> 06:57.625
he's bigger than I am.

06:57.667 --> 06:59.460
He's in second grade.

06:59.502 --> 07:01.338
Look at all this blood.

07:01.380 --> 07:02.881
That's not blood,

07:01.380 --> 07:02.881
it's pizza sauce.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.383
Well, that's blood, but...

07:04.423 --> 07:06.343
Oh, my God.

07:04.423 --> 07:06.343
Oh, my God!

07:06.385 --> 07:08.387
What happened?

07:08.427 --> 07:10.097
I want my Teletubby!

07:10.138 --> 07:11.472
A doll?

07:11.514 --> 07:13.767
You can't play with dolls

07:11.514 --> 07:13.767
if you're seven.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.476
Why are you seven?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.771
You beat up a

07:15.518 --> 07:17.771
seven-year-old?!

07:17.812 --> 07:19.189
I didn't know!

07:19.231 --> 07:21.482
Malcolm, I don't

07:19.231 --> 07:21.482
blame you.

07:21.524 --> 07:24.485
I put this squarely

07:21.524 --> 07:24.485
where it belongs.

07:24.527 --> 07:26.487
On me.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.950
Oh, man, this is the most

07:26.529 --> 07:29.950
horrible thing I've ever done.

07:29.991 --> 07:31.368
Kevin, I'm sorry.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.787
I think you've done

07:31.410 --> 07:33.787
quite enough.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.705
This is the worst

07:33.828 --> 07:35.705
birthday ever!

07:45.548 --> 07:46.967
"Inappropriate,

07:47.008 --> 07:48.427
vicious."

07:48.468 --> 07:49.761
Oh, wait-- "Thug"?

07:49.803 --> 07:51.763
Dude, I've never

07:49.803 --> 07:51.763
gotten "thug" before.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.181
That's like the Oscar.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.557
Susie Gunther

07:53.223 --> 07:54.557
ate my crayons.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.517
Can you beat her up tomorrow?

07:56.559 --> 07:57.685
Leave me alone.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.354
You know what my

07:57.727 --> 07:59.354
favorite part is?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.731
It's when you pound on someone,

07:59.396 --> 08:01.731
and then a day later,

08:01.773 --> 08:03.524
you still feel the pain

08:01.773 --> 08:03.524
in your knuckles.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.901
Oh, I love that.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.527
Shut up, Reese.

08:06.569 --> 08:08.363
Hey, hey, pace

08:06.569 --> 08:08.363
yourself, killer.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.157
(chain saw buzzing)

08:10.198 --> 08:11.491
Whoa.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.619
(whooping)

08:14.661 --> 08:16.204
REESE:

08:14.661 --> 08:16.204
Dad.

08:16.246 --> 08:18.748
You cut down the tree,

08:16.246 --> 08:18.748
and we missed it?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.917
Oh, baby, you missed it,

08:18.790 --> 08:20.917
all right.

08:20.959 --> 08:23.170
I was about two-thirds

08:20.959 --> 08:23.170
of the way through her,

08:23.211 --> 08:24.629
then crack!

08:24.671 --> 08:26.547
Kaboom!

08:24.671 --> 08:26.547
(laughs)

08:26.589 --> 08:28.008
My chain saw goes flying.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.550
All the car alarms

08:28.049 --> 08:29.550
go off.

08:29.592 --> 08:32.804
About a hundred squirrels came

08:29.592 --> 08:32.804
boiling out of the branches.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.474
Then a pack of dogs

08:32.846 --> 08:35.474
came out of nowhere

08:35.515 --> 08:36.766
and chased them

08:35.515 --> 08:36.766
all over the neighborhood.

08:36.808 --> 08:39.436
Man, I've never seen

08:36.808 --> 08:39.436
anything like it.

08:39.478 --> 08:40.561
Man...

08:40.603 --> 08:42.063
Oh, don't worry, son.

08:42.105 --> 08:43.606
You'll get to share

08:42.105 --> 08:43.606
in the best part.

08:43.648 --> 08:44.899
Cleaning up.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.610
Boys, I think you'll enjoy

08:47.652 --> 08:49.570
my sexual awareness

08:47.652 --> 08:49.570
lecture next week.

08:49.612 --> 08:50.905
It's been called "riveting."

08:52.615 --> 08:53.992
It-it sure worked wonders

08:52.615 --> 08:53.992
for me, sir.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.576
The only woman

08:54.034 --> 08:55.576
I can think of

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
without vomiting

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
is my own mother.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.539
As it should be, son,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.539
as it should be.

09:01.333 --> 09:04.044
He's giving that same lecture

09:01.333 --> 09:04.044
to the underclassmen.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.587
I can't let

09:04.085 --> 09:06.587
that happen.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.423
I'm stealing

09:06.629 --> 09:08.423
his slides.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.050
And to you,

09:08.465 --> 09:10.050
that's a good idea?

09:10.091 --> 09:11.385
Oh, absolutely.

09:11.426 --> 09:14.388
I know it's

09:11.426 --> 09:14.388
hard-core, Stanley,

09:14.429 --> 09:16.264
but I'm not doing

09:14.429 --> 09:16.264
this for me.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.682
I'm doing it for them.

09:17.724 --> 09:19.893
After all, they

09:17.724 --> 09:19.893
are the future.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.231
Francis, I don't

09:22.103 --> 09:24.231
know why you assume

09:24.272 --> 09:26.525
we'll be able to just walk

09:24.272 --> 09:26.525
into Spangler's office

09:26.566 --> 09:27.650
and find the

09:26.566 --> 09:27.650
sex slides.

09:29.652 --> 09:32.572
Oh, man, I wish all my

09:29.652 --> 09:32.572
break-ins were this easy.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.412
Okay, I got it.

09:38.453 --> 09:39.454
Let's get out of here.

09:39.496 --> 09:40.580
Wait a second.

09:44.667 --> 09:47.628
Oh, my God,

09:44.667 --> 09:47.628
this is a gold mine.

09:47.670 --> 09:50.257
Spangler drinking.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.009
Spangler kissing.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.303
Spangler in

09:53.051 --> 09:55.303
a Speedo.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.637
Spangler out

09:55.345 --> 09:56.637
of a Speedo.

09:56.679 --> 09:57.847
All right,

09:56.679 --> 09:57.847
that's enough.

09:57.889 --> 09:58.806
Let's leave, huh?

09:58.848 --> 09:59.849
Wait a second.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.642
I have an idea.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
I'm gonna make Spangler's

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
sexual awareness lecture

10:03.978 --> 10:05.480
just a little more

10:03.978 --> 10:05.480
interesting.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.232
Now, Francis, you do realize

10:05.522 --> 10:07.232
what he'll do to you

10:07.274 --> 10:08.733
if you humiliate him

10:07.274 --> 10:08.733
like this, right?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.236
And yet

10:08.775 --> 10:11.236
I'm doing it anyway.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.280
Weird, huh?

10:13.321 --> 10:15.656
DEWEY:

10:13.321 --> 10:15.656
Why are the eggs so little?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.535
They're robin's eggs from

10:15.698 --> 10:18.535
the tree your father cut down.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.703
Paul Bunyan.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
HAL:

10:20.745 --> 10:22.663
That's nature for you.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.874
Hundred years to grow,

10:22.705 --> 10:24.874
12 minutes to cut down.

10:24.916 --> 10:27.668
There's got to be a lesson

10:24.916 --> 10:27.668
in there somewhere.

10:27.710 --> 10:29.379
It is nice having this

10:27.710 --> 10:29.379
extra light in the room.

10:29.421 --> 10:31.590
Yeah, wait till I bring

10:29.421 --> 10:31.590
in the wood chipper.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
Then you're really

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
gonna see something.

10:33.383 --> 10:34.842
I can't take

10:33.383 --> 10:34.842
this anymore.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.677
When are you

10:34.884 --> 10:36.677
gonna punish me?

10:36.719 --> 10:37.762
For what?

10:37.804 --> 10:39.264
For beating up a

10:37.804 --> 10:39.264
seven-year-old.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.516
(laughing)

10:43.226 --> 10:44.478
LOIS: Oh, my God,

10:43.226 --> 10:44.478
that's right.

10:44.519 --> 10:45.937
You must've just felt ridiculous

10:45.979 --> 10:47.730
when you found out

10:45.979 --> 10:47.730
how old that kid was.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.191
I can only imagine

10:47.772 --> 10:50.191
the look on your face.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.692
(Lois laughs)

10:50.233 --> 10:51.692
(Hal chuckles)

10:51.734 --> 10:53.612
(doorbell rings)

10:53.653 --> 10:54.946
I'll get it.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.323
Oh, this is nice.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.907
We should start every day

10:56.364 --> 10:57.907
with a good laugh.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.909
It's not funny.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.077
It's awful.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.412
I did something

11:01.119 --> 11:02.412
horrible.

11:02.454 --> 11:03.704
Don't you even care?

11:03.746 --> 11:05.624
Well, it's nothing

11:03.746 --> 11:05.624
to be proud of, son,

11:05.665 --> 11:07.417
but you told us

11:05.665 --> 11:07.417
the whole story,

11:07.459 --> 11:09.210
and he didn't give you

11:07.459 --> 11:09.210
much choice.

11:09.252 --> 11:11.004
It was an honest

11:09.252 --> 11:11.004
beating mistake.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.423
Besides, it sends a good

11:11.045 --> 11:13.423
message to our enemies.

11:13.465 --> 11:14.715
What are you

11:13.465 --> 11:14.715
talking about?

11:14.757 --> 11:15.716
What enemies?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.718
Oh, they're out there.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.221
And once they know

11:17.760 --> 11:20.221
we're capable of this,

11:20.263 --> 11:22.056
they'll know we're capable

11:20.263 --> 11:22.056
of anything.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.728
Okay, so it's not just me,

11:24.767 --> 11:27.728
right?

11:27.770 --> 11:29.814
There's something seriously

11:27.770 --> 11:29.814
wrong with this family.

11:29.856 --> 11:33.734
LOIS: It's none of your business

11:29.856 --> 11:33.734
what we do on our property.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.320
ED: That tree was older

11:33.776 --> 11:35.320
than your house.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.737
You had no right

11:35.362 --> 11:36.737
to cut it down.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.906
We're a neighborhood,

11:36.779 --> 11:38.906
and removing trees

11:38.948 --> 11:40.741
is a neighborhood

11:38.948 --> 11:40.741
decision.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.785
Oh, y-you people-- for 15

11:40.783 --> 11:42.785
years you've mowed your lawns

11:42.827 --> 11:45.330
in the middle of the night so

11:42.827 --> 11:45.330
you don't have to talk to us.

11:45.372 --> 11:46.789
Now, what, all of a sudden

11:45.372 --> 11:46.789
we're a neighborhood?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.416
What's going

11:46.831 --> 11:48.416
on here?

11:48.458 --> 11:50.544
ED: You've caused

11:48.458 --> 11:50.544
a blight on our street

11:50.585 --> 11:51.752
by cutting down

11:50.585 --> 11:51.752
that tree.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.380
How is cutting down

11:51.794 --> 11:53.380
a tree a blight?

11:53.421 --> 11:54.797
Because now we can

11:53.421 --> 11:54.797
see your house.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.758
LOIS: Well, let me tell

11:54.839 --> 11:57.758
you something, Ed.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.387
As far as I'm concerned, you and

11:57.800 --> 12:00.387
the neighbors can all just...

12:00.428 --> 12:01.929
(imitates monkey chatter)

12:01.971 --> 12:03.431
Eh? And that goes

12:01.971 --> 12:03.431
double for me.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.141
I want you all off

12:03.473 --> 12:05.141
our property now or I'll...

12:05.183 --> 12:07.935
(imitates

12:05.183 --> 12:07.935
gorilla grunts)

12:07.977 --> 12:10.771
(imitating monkeys,

12:07.977 --> 12:10.771
gorillas)

12:11.898 --> 12:14.733
(imitating monkey chatter)

12:15.985 --> 12:17.987
(imitating monkeys, gorillas)

12:20.490 --> 12:22.367
No wonder I'm a thug.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.494
How can they act like this?

12:31.251 --> 12:33.002
And then I found out

12:31.251 --> 12:33.002
that he was only seven.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.713
I didn't know what to do.

12:34.753 --> 12:36.506
I just felt like I had

12:34.753 --> 12:36.506
to talk to someone.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.466
I hope I'm doing

12:36.548 --> 12:38.466
this right.

12:38.508 --> 12:41.302
See, my family-- we're not,

12:38.508 --> 12:41.302
like, regular churchgoers,

12:41.344 --> 12:43.096
but I know places

12:41.344 --> 12:43.096
like this are supposed

12:43.137 --> 12:44.639
to help you

12:43.137 --> 12:44.639
feel better,

12:44.681 --> 12:45.973
and that's really what I need.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.642
I did something terrible,

12:47.684 --> 12:50.103
and now I just feel like there's

12:47.684 --> 12:50.103
something wrong with me.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.855
I mean, really wrong,

12:50.144 --> 12:52.855
deep inside.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.649
I can't shake it.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.816
What do I do?

12:55.858 --> 12:58.819
Look to the church.

12:58.861 --> 12:59.820
Look to God.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.822
Look within.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.033
But first you must

13:01.864 --> 13:04.033
ask forgiveness.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.033
First, you must atone.

13:04.075 --> 13:05.826
First, you must cleanse

13:04.075 --> 13:05.826
your spirit.

13:05.868 --> 13:07.412
(hip hop music plays)

13:05.868 --> 13:07.412
The path to salvation.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.538
The path to temptation.

13:08.580 --> 13:09.830
The path to meditation.

13:09.872 --> 13:10.998
How does one define a sin?

13:11.040 --> 13:12.333
Well, it's

13:11.040 --> 13:12.333
mostly common sense.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.334
And you have

13:12.375 --> 13:13.334
to light incense.

13:13.376 --> 13:14.544
If you practiced abstinence.

13:14.586 --> 13:16.254
It's whatever space you're in.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.757
Huh?

13:18.797 --> 13:19.882
Ch-Ch-Charity.

13:18.797 --> 13:19.882
Prosperity.

13:19.924 --> 13:20.883
Clarity.

13:19.924 --> 13:20.883
Divine.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.009
Restitution.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.009
Absolution.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.344
Contribution.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.344
Palestine.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.429
Sacramental.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.429
Accidental.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.846
Mostly mental.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.846
You'll be fine.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
Transubstantiate.

13:25.888 --> 13:27.098
Alleviate.

13:27.140 --> 13:30.518
Who knows?

13:27.140 --> 13:30.518
Align your spine.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.854
Uh... well, thanks.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.856
I feel much better. Bye.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.321
Hey, boys.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.863
Where's your brother?

13:42.905 --> 13:44.115
I don't know.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.659
