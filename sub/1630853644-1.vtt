WEBVTT

02:17.745 --> 02:19.175
What the hell?

02:31.157 --> 02:33.025
Hey,
did you hear that?

02:33.060 --> 02:34.587
Sounded like a bomb
went off.

02:34.622 --> 02:36.228
No, but I heard
police sirens

02:36.264 --> 02:38.465
and thought maybe
they were coming for you.

02:41.902 --> 02:43.669
Where are you going?

02:43.705 --> 02:44.972
I got called in.

02:45.007 --> 02:47.870
Boss doesn't trust Enzo
to run the shop.

02:47.905 --> 02:49.210
Shocker.

02:49.978 --> 02:52.677
It's Zoey's birthday,
Orlando.

02:55.511 --> 02:57.847
Who else am I
doing this for, Kim?

02:57.882 --> 03:01.416
I can't lose this job.
They're laying people off
left and right.

03:01.451 --> 03:04.117
Checks aren't what
they used to be.

03:04.153 --> 03:05.853
Listen...

03:07.562 --> 03:10.231
I think we're gonna go
to my mom's for Christmas
this year.

03:12.695 --> 03:14.827
I thought you were
just thinking about it.

03:14.862 --> 03:18.470
Well, I thought about it,
and I decided.

03:20.036 --> 03:23.773
- I really, really didn't
want to do this today.

03:23.809 --> 03:28.079
But today was the one day
for you to choose us
over work

03:28.115 --> 03:29.880
and not make it
about yourself.

03:29.915 --> 03:31.417
Zoey's day.

03:49.601 --> 03:51.734
How long are you gonna
keep punishing me for?

03:53.337 --> 03:55.001
We have tried everything.

03:57.042 --> 03:58.609
And I just can't.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.281
So, I'll have Zoey
call you at noon,

04:05.316 --> 04:06.580
and you and I can play nice.

04:06.616 --> 04:09.015
If you can
make the time for her.

04:28.137 --> 04:29.409
Hmm.

04:37.315 --> 04:39.045
Play the board,
not me.

04:40.317 --> 04:42.719
Patience, Old Yeller.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.457
Hmm...

04:48.493 --> 04:50.529
Is that your action,
Action Jackson?

04:53.932 --> 04:58.105
And Chief wanted me
to remind you to stop
leaving your Cialis out.

04:58.140 --> 04:59.803
Apparently, Jake thought
they were Advil,

04:59.838 --> 05:02.068
- and had to cancel
his PTA meeting.

05:03.743 --> 05:07.106
I know you're forgetting
things as your age,
but, you know...

05:07.142 --> 05:10.351
I'll always remember
the ass-whooping
you're about to get.

05:11.986 --> 05:14.213
Oh, big talk, big talk.

05:14.249 --> 05:15.785
Hmm...

05:18.055 --> 05:20.955
Before you take your hand off,
you sure you want to do that?

05:29.266 --> 05:30.999
Okay, be a hero.

05:31.035 --> 05:34.669
What the hell
does your broke down ass
know about being a hero?

05:34.704 --> 05:36.938
Ah, more than
you'd like to know.

05:38.712 --> 05:41.709
We've known each other
for, what? How long now?
Six months?

05:41.744 --> 05:45.779
Really? Are you going
to do this again?

05:45.814 --> 05:48.086
It's been four months
since my transfer.

05:48.122 --> 05:49.951
Seems like so much longer.

05:49.986 --> 05:52.186
And you're still making
those damn rookie mistakes.

05:52.222 --> 05:53.526
Checkmate.

05:54.658 --> 05:56.991
Let's go again.
Nah, best of three.

05:57.026 --> 06:00.901
- No, I already won twice.
- All right, best of five.

06:00.936 --> 06:02.235
- Hey, guys.
- Yep.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.267
We got a 10-80.
Explosion at Neil Park.

06:30.162 --> 06:32.730
Zoey bear. You up?

06:48.478 --> 06:51.116
First one in again.

06:51.151 --> 06:52.511
Good morning, ladies.

06:52.547 --> 06:54.416
Time to wake up.

06:54.452 --> 06:57.216
Rise and shine, Cindy Lou.

06:58.423 --> 07:00.021
Top of the morning to ya.

07:29.121 --> 07:31.055
All right.

07:37.661 --> 07:39.896
We Save You IT.
How can I help?

07:39.931 --> 07:45.134
<i>My-my internet has passed away.</i>

07:45.170 --> 07:48.375
All right,
let's see if we can't
bring that back to life.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.203
- Are you near your router?
<i>- Router?</i>

07:51.546 --> 07:53.775
Yeah, you know, the box
with the blinking light.

07:53.810 --> 07:56.845
<i>Isn't-isn't that the computer?</i>

07:56.881 --> 07:59.248
No, miss, the other box
with the blinking light.

07:59.284 --> 08:00.913
<i> Yes.</i>

08:00.949 --> 08:03.117
- All right...

08:04.293 --> 08:06.126
...let's try
and restart that router.

08:06.161 --> 08:08.091
Flip it back on and give a sec.

08:12.696 --> 08:15.463
<i>- Off, kitty!</i>

08:15.499 --> 08:16.999
Ooh, she sounds cute.

08:19.770 --> 08:23.509
<i>- Nothing.</i>
- Well, if you trust me,

08:23.545 --> 08:26.144
I could save you
a lot of time on a shortcut.

08:26.179 --> 08:27.673
<i>Mm, shortcut?</i>

08:28.609 --> 08:32.185
You know, sometimes,
when I'm driving,
I like to take the scenic route.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.987
Other times, faster is better.

08:35.023 --> 08:36.986
What do you say?

08:37.021 --> 08:39.686
<i>- Let's try the shortcut.</i>

08:39.721 --> 08:41.754
All right, here we go.

08:55.770 --> 08:57.307
All right.

08:57.342 --> 08:59.239
Naughty, naughty.

09:08.122 --> 09:08.948
<i>How'd you do it?</i>

09:08.984 --> 09:11.490
Well, some people
call it magic,

09:11.525 --> 09:14.391
I just call it
customer service, miss.

09:14.426 --> 09:16.194
Others call it illegal.

09:16.229 --> 09:18.398
<i>Oh, calling me miss.</i>

09:18.434 --> 09:21.560
<i>You know how to make</i>
<i>an old gal feel young.</i>

09:21.596 --> 09:25.165
Well, there's survey
after this call,
if you enjoyed my service.

09:25.201 --> 09:28.972
And by the way, "password"
isn't a good password.

09:29.007 --> 09:31.671
-<i> Ah...</i>
- Thank you, ma'am.
Have a nice day.

09:31.706 --> 09:33.710
Whoa! He shoots...

09:33.745 --> 09:38.113
Oh, he scores,
and the crowd goes wild!

09:39.048 --> 09:41.781
Man, like, how do you
do it, for real?

09:41.816 --> 09:43.384
It's called charm, bro.

09:43.419 --> 09:45.954
- Something you know
nothing about.
- Oh, I know nothing?

09:45.989 --> 09:47.892
I used to do magic
at kids' parties, my friend.

09:47.927 --> 09:51.258
- That is charm intensive.
- Get out of town. Really?

09:51.294 --> 09:54.667
- My daughter loves magic.
- Yeah, of course she does.

09:54.703 --> 09:58.135
Everyone's a sucker
for a little... sleight of hand.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.971
Whoa, dude,
that was good, man.

10:02.007 --> 10:05.138
Eh, right. It's a sick spot
to meet MILFs, too.

10:05.173 --> 10:07.106
I'm serious, though.
Mary's going to be pissed

10:07.141 --> 10:08.712
if she finds out
you came in late again.

10:08.747 --> 10:10.483
Really?
More than if she found out

10:10.518 --> 10:12.749
you just hacked
a client's system?

10:12.784 --> 10:15.887
I took nothing.
Left a customer happy.

10:17.091 --> 10:19.390
Ah, fuck it.

10:19.425 --> 10:21.253
Oh, speaking of happy...

10:21.289 --> 10:23.758
Looks like the boss
left us a couple gifts.

10:23.793 --> 10:25.624
- No shit, really?
- Yeah.

10:25.659 --> 10:27.027
Really?

10:27.062 --> 10:29.133
I guess she's
good for something.

10:29.169 --> 10:31.331
Ooh, nice.

10:34.109 --> 10:35.302
What the hell?

10:36.338 --> 10:39.378
You know,
my buddy at Google
just got a laptop.

10:39.413 --> 10:40.577
Yeah, and we got
black balls.

10:40.613 --> 10:43.409
Shit, man,
what's the difference?

10:43.444 --> 10:46.115
Machines are gonna render us
obsolete any second now.

10:47.788 --> 10:50.187
Maybe cleaning windows
will be our next gig.

10:50.222 --> 10:51.150
Hell no.

10:51.185 --> 10:52.924
I mean, you afraid
of heights, bro?

10:52.959 --> 10:55.427
- Hell yeah!
- Yeah, I probably
should have been, too.

10:55.462 --> 10:57.193
How do you think
I got this?

10:57.229 --> 11:00.000
- Well, I thought
it was too rude to ask.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.393
No, come on.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.734
It was a construction
gig fall when I was 17.

11:03.769 --> 11:05.272
You know, you'd think
the worst part

11:05.307 --> 11:07.235
would be the impact,
but no.

11:08.003 --> 11:10.609
It is the shame
of being on top,

11:10.645 --> 11:12.977
and then fall on
your ass in the dirt.

11:14.615 --> 11:17.148
Pops never quite
got over that one.

11:17.183 --> 11:19.948
His army brat gimp
not being able
to follow in his footsteps.

11:19.983 --> 11:23.353
Oh, just a parent's love.

11:23.389 --> 11:24.988
Hey.

11:25.023 --> 11:27.286
<i>Reports of a bomb going off</i>
<i>in Neil Park.</i>

11:27.321 --> 11:29.557
<i>So far,</i>
<i>there is only one fatality.</i>

11:29.593 --> 11:32.124
<i>We'll keep you updated</i>
<i>as more information</i>
<i>becomes available.</i>

11:32.160 --> 11:34.364
I think I heard that
on my run today.

11:34.400 --> 11:35.769
Oh, that blows.

11:40.441 --> 11:42.474
That dude looks familiar.

11:42.510 --> 11:44.638
Eh... not anymore,
my friend.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.278
Ah, finally.

11:51.982 --> 11:54.521
- Here you go.
- Where's the usual guy?

11:54.556 --> 11:56.050
Uh, not my day
to keep track, bud.

11:56.086 --> 11:57.752
Yeah, well, as long as
the pastrami's bomb.

11:57.787 --> 12:00.125
Pastrami for breakfast?

12:01.894 --> 12:03.624
Don't knock it
till you try it, my friend.

12:03.660 --> 12:05.331
Whatever, dude.

12:05.366 --> 12:06.793
Eh, that's good enough.

12:06.829 --> 12:07.963
Here, keep the change.

12:07.998 --> 12:11.299
Hey, merry Christmas
ya filthy animal.

12:25.554 --> 12:27.581
Bad day to go
to the park, I guess.

12:27.616 --> 12:28.954
Yeah.

12:30.787 --> 12:32.386
Ten pounds of semtex.

12:32.421 --> 12:36.258
Most likely remotely wired
to a medium range detonator.

12:41.602 --> 12:44.332
Whoever did this
wanted to watch.

12:45.938 --> 12:48.204
I don't think
this was a chance victim.

12:49.372 --> 12:51.904
Gotta be real pissed
to blow a guy up like this.

12:51.940 --> 12:54.045
Yeah, there's that.

12:55.277 --> 12:58.082
You think this was
just a simple vendetta?

12:59.586 --> 13:02.681
- Don't you?
- I don't know.

13:02.716 --> 13:05.324
Wanna look beyond the obvious,
you know, check the whole board.

13:05.360 --> 13:07.593
Okay, Bobby Fischer.

13:07.629 --> 13:09.288
Let's go fishing.
What do you think?

13:09.323 --> 13:12.799
Well, it's
a military-grade trigger.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.566
That's a custom job.
A lot of man hours on this.

13:14.601 --> 13:15.935
I mean, this is a career man.

13:15.970 --> 13:18.135
I think he gets a thrill
out of his own handiwork.

13:20.202 --> 13:22.403
I don't think
this is the endgame.

13:32.616 --> 13:34.153
What the...?

13:40.062 --> 13:41.026
Ah!

13:41.795 --> 13:44.096
Hey, the inmates
running the asylum?

13:44.132 --> 13:47.697
<i>Replacement cake</i>
<i>just arrived.</i>
<i>We had an incident.</i>

13:47.732 --> 13:49.263
<i>Hey, guys, keep it down.</i>

13:49.299 --> 13:51.436
<i>Um, Zoey wanted to open</i>
<i>your present early,</i>

13:51.471 --> 13:52.834
<i>so I let her.</i>

13:52.869 --> 13:56.243
Oh. Did you get my text?

13:56.278 --> 13:57.910
<i>Yeah, um, I did.</i>

13:57.945 --> 14:01.409
<i>And, uh... Hey, Zoey,</i>
<i>your dad's on the phone.</i>

14:06.552 --> 14:08.817
Hey, Zoey bear!

14:08.852 --> 14:10.457
Happy birthday, honey.

14:10.492 --> 14:11.954
<i>Why aren't you here, Dad?</i>

14:11.990 --> 14:13.958
Well, honey,
I wish I could be there.

14:13.993 --> 14:15.522
I had to work.
I couldn't get out of it.

14:15.557 --> 14:19.296
<i>That's what you always say.</i>
<i>It's my birthday.</i>

14:19.331 --> 14:22.497
<i>Mom says that's basically</i>
<i>a holiday, and she's here.</i>

14:22.532 --> 14:26.537
Well, you know,
computer gremlins
never sleep, Zoey.

14:26.573 --> 14:27.602
You get my present?

14:27.637 --> 14:28.975
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:30.443 --> 14:31.509
You like it?

14:31.545 --> 14:33.541
<i>No, I love magic.</i>

14:33.576 --> 14:36.744
<i>I practice,</i>
<i>but I'm not sure</i>
<i>if I've got it yet.</i>

14:36.779 --> 14:40.549
I think you
got to start that trick
with your right hand, Zoey.

14:40.584 --> 14:41.750
<i>Oh.</i>

14:41.785 --> 14:42.919
<i> Sorry.</i>

14:42.955 --> 14:45.420
That's it, right there!
You got it.

14:47.892 --> 14:50.293
<i>Yeah, I'll keep practice--</i>

14:55.131 --> 14:56.494
<i>...more magic tricks tonight?</i>

14:56.530 --> 14:58.236
<i>I'm sure my friends</i>
<i>would like it.</i>

14:58.271 --> 15:02.839
You know what?
I just happen to have
Houdini handcuffs.

15:02.874 --> 15:04.536
We could try this trick tonight.

15:04.571 --> 15:08.173
<i> Hey, who's</i>
<i>that idiot in the back?</i>

15:08.208 --> 15:09.749
That's Enzo.

15:09.784 --> 15:11.180
Say hi to Zoey.
We work together.

15:11.215 --> 15:13.245
- This is my buddy.
- Well, hey there, Zoey.

15:13.280 --> 15:15.251
Hey, I hear you like magic, too.

15:15.286 --> 15:17.285
You know, maybe I'm gonna
make your dad disappear

15:17.320 --> 15:19.286
if he keeps running late
to work all the time.

15:19.321 --> 15:21.692
I mean, this guy
is so unprofessional.

15:21.727 --> 15:22.922
<i>Yeah. Well, I gotta go.</i>

15:22.957 --> 15:24.531
Bye, honey.

15:24.566 --> 15:26.197
I love you. Happy birthday.

15:27.997 --> 15:29.767
<i>I got to go, party time.</i>

15:29.802 --> 15:31.233
<i>Um, thanks for making the time.</i>

15:31.268 --> 15:34.340
Yeah. Hey, you watch out
for those boys. Huh?

15:34.375 --> 15:35.701
I love you.

15:44.013 --> 15:45.545
Oh, hell no, bro!

15:45.581 --> 15:48.718
Come on, how do you fuck up
a pastrami sandwich?

15:48.753 --> 15:50.957
You know what? No.

15:50.992 --> 15:53.626
- Lando, I-I gotta
take ten. Cool?
- Huh?

15:53.662 --> 15:55.160
No, no, come on,
it's slow, bro.

15:55.196 --> 15:57.056
And the new delivery guy's
not getting away with this shit.

15:57.091 --> 15:59.494
Plus, you know,
I got a little business
a couple floors down, so...

15:59.530 --> 16:02.198
- Yeah? New job prospect?
- Oh, man, this one's an angel.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.463
- Yeah? The hot blonde?
- No. No, no, keep up.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.505
That's Ava.
That's the 7th floor chick.

16:06.541 --> 16:07.465
She's...

16:07.501 --> 16:09.634
She's crazy.
She's like legit crazy.

16:09.669 --> 16:11.636
Ah, crazy in the head,
crazy in bed, right?

16:11.672 --> 16:14.177
Yeah, but this is like
boiling bunny's crazy.

16:14.213 --> 16:16.413
It's a different--
Anyway, just do me favor.

16:16.449 --> 16:18.645
If she shows up here,
just tell her I'm not here.
Okay?

16:18.680 --> 16:23.023
Hey, you do know Mary checks
the security feeds, right?

16:25.288 --> 16:27.159
You don't think
I thought of that, bro?

16:28.359 --> 16:30.893
My desk is in the blind spot
of this office.

16:30.929 --> 16:32.725
Mm. Not as dumb as I look.

16:33.727 --> 16:36.696
- I don't know
about that, bro.
- Shut up.

16:47.175 --> 16:49.247
This fucking guy, man.

17:13.475 --> 17:14.734
What the hell?

17:27.782 --> 17:30.555
<i>No matter what happens...</i>

17:30.591 --> 17:31.790
<i>stay seated.</i>

17:31.825 --> 17:34.688
- <i> Orlando,</i>

17:34.723 --> 17:38.263
<i>this is one problem</i>
<i>there is no running from.</i>

17:40.327 --> 17:41.627
Who the hell is this?

17:41.662 --> 17:45.669
<i>Top drawer on your left,</i>
<i>there's a mirror.</i>

17:45.705 --> 17:47.206
<i>Take it out.</i>

17:49.544 --> 17:50.638
What the fuck?

17:53.577 --> 17:56.715
Enzo, I swear to God,
I'm going to kick your ass.

17:56.750 --> 17:58.718
<i>Guess again, bitch.</i>

17:58.753 --> 18:01.118
<i>Orlando, you will die today</i>

18:01.154 --> 18:04.756
<i>unless you do</i>
<i>exactly as you're told.</i>

18:04.791 --> 18:07.356
<i>So take the mirror,</i>

18:07.391 --> 18:11.362
<i>place it under your chair,</i>
<i>and look.</i>

18:15.733 --> 18:17.302
<i>Hotter.</i>

18:18.335 --> 18:20.806
-<i> Hotter.</i>
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:20.842 --> 18:23.572
-<i> Yes.</i>
- What the hell is this?

18:24.778 --> 18:26.371
<i>Put your hand on it.</i>

18:26.406 --> 18:28.808
<i>Put your hand on it!</i>

18:36.251 --> 18:37.652
What the hell is that?

18:38.686 --> 18:40.588
<i>There's enough semtex</i>
<i>on that chair</i>

18:40.624 --> 18:43.393
<i>for the biggest</i>
<i>New Year's show in history.</i>

18:43.429 --> 18:47.200
<i>It's pressure-sensitive,</i>
<i>so no more sudden jolts.</i>

18:49.730 --> 18:51.466
<i>Oh, and I don't know</i>
<i>if you noticed</i>

18:51.501 --> 18:53.602
<i>that new area rug</i>
<i>around the chair?</i>

18:54.974 --> 18:58.074
<i>That is an electric fence.</i>

18:58.109 --> 18:59.609
<i>So if you try and roll out,</i>

18:59.645 --> 19:02.509
<i>like you're used to running</i>
<i>from most of your problems,</i>

19:02.544 --> 19:05.779
<i>this one</i>
<i>won't let you get far.</i>

19:08.485 --> 19:11.991
<i>Do I have your attention</i>
<i>now, Orlando?</i>

19:12.026 --> 19:15.261
<i>Or should I call you</i>
<i>Red Knight?</i>

19:18.429 --> 19:21.366
<i>That was your hacker handle,</i>
<i>wasn't it?</i>

19:21.401 --> 19:24.697
<i> You got a slap</i>
<i>on the wrist for what you did,</i>

19:24.733 --> 19:27.504
<i>but I guess</i>
<i>that comes with being a rat.</i>

19:31.106 --> 19:32.474
Hey, look,

19:32.509 --> 19:34.643
if you're some kind
of a hacking enthusiast,

19:35.949 --> 19:37.216
I'm sorry to disappoint you,

19:37.251 --> 19:38.943
but I've been out of the game
a long time now.

19:38.979 --> 19:42.048
<i>Oh, I think you'll</i>
<i>pick it back up just fine.</i>

19:43.817 --> 19:46.125
<i>If you think</i>
<i>that seat is hot now,</i>

19:46.160 --> 19:49.629
<i>it's about to get</i>
<i>a whole lot hotter.</i>

19:49.664 --> 19:50.995
<i>Smile for me.</i>

19:51.030 --> 19:52.529
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

19:53.868 --> 19:55.395
<i>Two floors up:</i>

19:55.430 --> 19:57.368
<i>bankers, hedge fund crooks,</i>

19:57.403 --> 19:59.503
<i>jack-holes, whatever</i>
<i>you want to call them.</i>

20:00.841 --> 20:03.870
<i>I want you to rob them.</i>

20:07.245 --> 20:09.277
<i>If I get caught,</i>
<i>I'm facing 20.</i>

20:09.312 --> 20:11.746
I'll never see my family again.

20:12.847 --> 20:14.682
<i>Well, that's a funny way</i>
<i>of looking at things,</i>

20:14.717 --> 20:16.715
<i>because you'll really</i>
<i>never see them again</i>

20:16.750 --> 20:18.984
<i>when you're blown</i>
<i>to kingdom come.</i>

20:25.297 --> 20:27.460
<i>Don't you want</i>
<i>a chance to fix</i>

20:27.495 --> 20:30.236
<i>that shit marriage of yours?</i>

20:30.271 --> 20:33.236
<i>Failure to complete</i>
<i>your mission, you die.</i>

20:33.272 --> 20:35.369
<i>Your friends interfere,</i>
<i>you die.</i>

20:35.404 --> 20:37.369
<i>Call the police, you die.</i>

20:37.405 --> 20:39.310
<i>And after you die,</i>

20:39.345 --> 20:42.814
<i>your wife and pretty</i>
<i>little daughter</i>

20:42.849 --> 20:44.113
<i>will die, too.</i>

20:44.148 --> 20:47.347
I... I can't do this.

20:47.382 --> 20:50.152
<i>Oh, don't be modest.</i>

20:50.187 --> 20:53.024
<i>This is your nature.</i>

20:53.059 --> 20:55.762
<i>And you don't have a choice.</i>

20:55.797 --> 20:58.127
If I do this, I go home?

20:58.162 --> 20:59.893
<i>Never hurts to try.</i>

21:05.533 --> 21:07.632
I have researched their system.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.502
Of course you did.

21:09.537 --> 21:11.340
They got blockade security.

21:11.376 --> 21:13.740
If I break in,
there's 90 seconds

21:13.775 --> 21:16.882
till it shuts down,
locks the accounts.

21:16.917 --> 21:18.846
<i>That's why I chose you.</i>

21:21.816 --> 21:26.123
Okay, one thing.
I need my music. Okay?

21:26.158 --> 21:27.353
<i>As long as it's not country.</i>

21:27.388 --> 21:29.560
It's not country.

21:35.131 --> 21:36.567
All right.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.400
Okay.

22:35.862 --> 22:37.056
We're in.

22:39.133 --> 22:41.159
<i>I never doubted you.</i>

22:42.732 --> 22:45.163
That's not the part
I was worried about.

22:49.072 --> 22:51.037
<i>Hey, have you seen this?</i>
<i>There's been a breach.</i>

22:56.081 --> 22:59.079
<i> Ninety seconds</i>
<i>starts now.</i>
<i>Looks like you got caught.</i>

22:59.114 --> 23:00.981
- You break into banks,
people notice.

23:02.517 --> 23:03.819
Where's Enzo?

23:04.686 --> 23:06.426
Hey, hey, hey.

23:07.655 --> 23:09.193
Where is that asshole, Enzo?

23:09.229 --> 23:10.562
He's been ducking me
for a week.

23:10.597 --> 23:12.023
Quiet, quiet.
Stay there. Stay there.

23:12.058 --> 23:14.193
What, is everyone
on this floor a total jerk?

23:14.228 --> 23:16.701
<i>Yes, stay. There's a bomb</i>
<i>under his seat,</i>

23:16.736 --> 23:19.970
<i>and if either of you leave,</i>
<i>you're both fucking dead!</i>

23:20.005 --> 23:21.837
Uh... A what?

23:23.505 --> 23:25.071
Look under my chair.

23:31.147 --> 23:32.315
Shit!

23:32.350 --> 23:33.782
<i>I suggest you let him work</i>

23:33.817 --> 23:36.214
<i>before there's too many pieces</i>
<i>of you to clean up.</i>

23:47.530 --> 23:48.996
Yeah, yeah, I'm handling it.

23:50.401 --> 23:51.999
Damn it. No, no!

23:52.035 --> 23:55.441
- <i> Figure it out.</i>
- My gear is in the locker.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.810
I need you to shut this down
so I can get my kit.

24:00.645 --> 24:03.247
- I-I have to go.
- You can't go anywhere.

24:03.282 --> 24:05.677
If you leave,
we're both dead.

24:05.713 --> 24:07.515
Please. I need your help.

24:07.550 --> 24:09.187
- What's your name?
- Ava.

24:09.222 --> 24:10.817
What's happening?

24:10.852 --> 24:13.354
Ava, I need you
to get my locker, okay?

24:13.389 --> 24:14.557
My kit's in there.

24:14.592 --> 24:16.290
If you don't do that,
we're dead.

24:16.325 --> 24:18.525
Go. Go, go!

24:18.561 --> 24:21.231
- Okay.
<i>- Better hurry.</i>

24:21.267 --> 24:23.334
Fourth over, blue locker.

24:23.369 --> 24:25.030
Yeah, right there,
right there.

24:25.065 --> 24:27.400
<i>- Come on.</i>
- All right, what's the code?

24:27.435 --> 24:28.739
It's 9-12...

24:30.173 --> 24:32.878
- Nine-12... I need
the lock...
- What's the third number?

24:32.914 --> 24:33.942
Thirty-three.

24:34.708 --> 24:35.809
That's the wrong code.

24:35.844 --> 24:38.148
Thirty-six, 9-12-36.
Hundred percent.

24:38.183 --> 24:39.948
<i>What's the code?</i>

24:39.983 --> 24:42.016
- That's it, go!
Come on, come on!
- Got it!

24:42.052 --> 24:45.987
<i>Tick, tock, tick, tock,</i>
<i>tick, tock, tick, tock...</i>

24:48.193 --> 24:49.257
<i>Thirty seconds.</i>

24:49.292 --> 24:50.629
Where is it?

24:52.164 --> 24:53.466
All this for that?

24:53.501 --> 24:56.564
This is what's gonna
get us out of here alive.

24:56.599 --> 24:58.800
It's a backdoor
program I made

24:58.836 --> 25:01.037
that allows me to break
through most firewalls.

25:01.073 --> 25:03.206
All right.

25:03.242 --> 25:05.039
<i>This better work.</i>

25:09.278 --> 25:11.749
No. No.

25:13.953 --> 25:14.917
<i>Come on.</i>

25:26.431 --> 25:28.095
He locked me out of my system.

25:31.072 --> 25:32.434
<i>Good work, Orlando.</i>

25:32.470 --> 25:35.636
Some people call it magic,

25:35.671 --> 25:37.335
I call it being good at my job.

25:44.647 --> 25:47.286
Code red, all hands on deck!

25:49.684 --> 25:51.921
<i>Very good, you two.</i>

25:53.625 --> 25:55.186
<i>It's amazing</i>
<i>what humans can do</i>

25:55.221 --> 25:57.330
<i>with their asses</i>
<i>up against the flame.</i>

25:57.365 --> 25:59.924
Tell me what the hell
is going on.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.633
<i>You like movies, Orlando?</i>

26:02.668 --> 26:04.468
I don't give a shit
about movies right now.

26:04.503 --> 26:06.870
<i>I really like </i> Apocalypse Now.

26:09.972 --> 26:11.973
<i>You know, I'm kinda</i>
<i>like Willard,</i>

26:12.009 --> 26:15.444
<i>floating down the river</i>
<i>to complete my mission.</i>

26:15.479 --> 26:16.977
<i>And you, well, I...</i>

26:17.013 --> 26:19.885
<i>I guess you're</i>
<i>stuck on the boat with me.</i>

26:21.285 --> 26:22.955
<i>What is this?</i>

26:22.990 --> 26:25.889
<i>Outsiders must be eliminated</i>
<i>with extreme prejudice.</i>

26:27.959 --> 26:30.893
- I just came to see Enzo.
- No, no, no, don't go.

26:30.928 --> 26:32.597
<i>Oh, then I guess</i>
<i>you better be extra good,</i>

26:32.633 --> 26:36.262
<i>so I change my mind</i>
<i>and don't kill you.</i>

26:39.635 --> 26:41.540
<i>That's a good girl.</i>

26:41.575 --> 26:44.677
<i>Now go take a seat</i>
<i>and enjoy the show.</i>

26:45.876 --> 26:48.208
<i>- That's right.</i>
- It's gonna be okay.

26:54.621 --> 26:58.317
<i>Now, Orlando,</i>
<i>the numbers on your screen.</i>

26:59.452 --> 27:01.625
<i>I want you to transfer</i>
<i>$2 million from the funds</i>

27:01.661 --> 27:03.663
<i>you just hacked</i>
<i>into that account.</i>

27:04.792 --> 27:06.227
It's gonna take time.

27:06.262 --> 27:08.800
<i>Don't bullshit a bullshitter.</i>
<i>You have five minutes.</i>

27:10.504 --> 27:12.703
<i>Be clear--</i>
<i>when I tell you to bark,</i>

27:12.739 --> 27:16.368
<i>your only question</i>
<i>should be, "How loud?"</i>

27:17.808 --> 27:19.409
<i>I'm gonna prep</i>
<i>our next mission.</i>

27:19.444 --> 27:20.740
<i>See you down the river.</i>

27:34.590 --> 27:36.291
Hey.

27:36.327 --> 27:37.422
Hey, Ava.

27:39.231 --> 27:43.164
Hey, is there anyone at work
that might notice
you're missing?

27:45.404 --> 27:47.635
- No one?
- No.

27:47.671 --> 27:49.841
My-my boss isn't in today.

27:50.709 --> 27:52.671
The only person
that knows I'm here is--

27:54.075 --> 27:55.778
No, no, sir,
sir. No, no.

27:55.814 --> 27:58.276
I-I clearly said pastrami,
not salami.

27:58.311 --> 28:00.582
- I-I mean, I understand...
- Enzo, Enzo.

28:00.617 --> 28:02.384
That's not my-- Jesus!

28:02.420 --> 28:03.723
What the fuck?

28:06.659 --> 28:10.222
Okay, uh, Ava,
I'm really sorry,

28:10.258 --> 28:12.763
but you cannot show up
to my work like this.

28:12.798 --> 28:16.298
- This is--
- There's a bomb under his seat.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.363
What?

28:19.203 --> 28:22.636
- What's she talking about?
- Park bomber on the news.

28:22.672 --> 28:24.007
I think this is him.

28:29.512 --> 28:30.816
Oh, shit.

28:33.586 --> 28:35.079
I'm gonna be sick.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.590
<i>Orlando, don't let him leave.</i>

28:37.625 --> 28:39.457
- What the fuck?!
- Hey, Enzo,

28:39.492 --> 28:41.054
if you leave,
we're all dead.

28:41.089 --> 28:43.994
- Jesus, dude!
- Enzo, please, listen.

28:44.029 --> 28:46.027
Listen? Listen to the fucking
voice in the walls?

28:46.063 --> 28:47.696
What the fuck are you
even doing here today?

28:47.731 --> 28:49.131
Your-your office is closed!

28:50.098 --> 28:52.063
Wait-wait, whoa,
whoa, whoa... Are you...

28:52.098 --> 28:54.166
Bitch, are you part of this?

28:54.201 --> 28:56.034
- Am I what?!
- Why are you here?!

28:56.069 --> 28:58.842
Looking for you,
you asshole!

28:58.878 --> 29:00.713
- Hey, hey, hey.

29:00.748 --> 29:02.241
I'm the one who's got
the skills to help you.

29:02.276 --> 29:05.175
<i>- Not them. Let 'em go.</i>

29:05.211 --> 29:07.314
Hey, Enzo,
don't go in there.

29:07.349 --> 29:09.488
I'm sorry, bro. I'm sorry.
I can't-- I can't do it.

29:09.524 --> 29:10.754
I'll call the cops
for you. Okay?

29:10.789 --> 29:12.357
If you go in there,
we're all dead.

29:12.392 --> 29:14.420
Be smart.
Enzo, no!

29:15.394 --> 29:16.622
I'm sorry. Sorry.

29:17.691 --> 29:18.657
Okay.

29:18.693 --> 29:20.294
Ava, down!

29:21.333 --> 29:22.461
Enzo, no!

29:44.017 --> 29:46.017
I knew it!
It's military.

29:46.053 --> 29:48.292
Just not modern military.

29:48.327 --> 29:49.822
Vietnam era.

29:49.857 --> 29:51.760
Pressure sensitive.

29:51.795 --> 29:53.227
Viet Cong
used to use them.

29:53.262 --> 29:55.159
Put so much
as a feather weight
on the trigger,

29:55.194 --> 29:57.228
try and take it off,
kaboom.

29:57.264 --> 30:00.070
Damn! That's like
Biblical old.

30:00.105 --> 30:02.641
That's like I was at
Methuselah's bar mitzvah old.

30:02.677 --> 30:05.175
Those are four syllables,
Methuselah, ooh.

30:05.210 --> 30:07.244
Yeah, I got him laid.
I was the first guy
to get him laid.

30:07.279 --> 30:08.540
I bet.

30:08.575 --> 30:10.749
- My big brother
came back from 'Nam.
- Yeah?

30:10.785 --> 30:12.979
He kinda taught me
all this explosive stuff,

30:13.015 --> 30:14.613
made it kind of a hobby
for us.

30:14.649 --> 30:18.753
- That explains a lot.
- Oh, yeah.
We were pyromaniacs.

30:18.788 --> 30:20.185
You blow enough shit up,

30:20.221 --> 30:21.787
your wires
will be crossed, too.

30:21.823 --> 30:23.259
Okay.

30:23.294 --> 30:26.361
Um, so what?
We head to every
veteran's support group

30:26.396 --> 30:28.394
and ask who's got
a chip on their shoulder,
or what?

30:28.429 --> 30:32.168
Sure, we can host
a bake sale
while we're at it.

30:32.204 --> 30:35.969
Actually, I think you might
enjoy patting those vets down.

30:36.005 --> 30:37.375
Give a cavity search,
whatever.

30:37.410 --> 30:39.109
Oh, yeah, love it.

30:39.145 --> 30:41.508
Why don't we just wait
for a fingerprint
from forensics?

30:41.543 --> 30:44.312
<i> All units,</i>
<i>proceed to Hudson Tower.</i>

30:45.986 --> 30:49.185
<i>There's been an explosion.</i>
<i>Repeat, all units.</i>

30:50.551 --> 30:53.354
We got a piece of cheese.
There's gotta be a pizza.

31:05.834 --> 31:07.335
What's going on?

31:17.677 --> 31:20.682
<i>This one goes out</i>
<i>to that late buddy of yours.</i>

31:20.717 --> 31:22.452
<i>Bye-bye, Enzo.</i>

31:22.487 --> 31:24.850
Enzo! Enzo!

31:33.061 --> 31:35.198
<i>- Easy, now.</i>

31:36.500 --> 31:37.667
Ava!

31:37.702 --> 31:40.569
Ava, can you hear me?

31:40.605 --> 31:42.571
Are you okay?

31:42.606 --> 31:45.340
<i>Why? Would you be after</i>
<i>part of the ceiling</i>
<i>hit you in the head?</i>

31:45.376 --> 31:48.406
<i>It's a pity.</i>
<i>But it wouldn't be</i>
<i>the first time</i>

31:48.442 --> 31:50.644
<i>others have</i>
<i>fallen for your sins.</i>

31:50.679 --> 31:53.917
You killed him,
you son of a bitch!
He didn't do anything!

31:53.953 --> 31:57.222
<i>Oh, please.</i>
<i>Did you even know him?</i>

31:57.258 --> 32:00.321
<i>Or was he just another</i>
<i>nameless, faceless</i>
<i>program to you?</i>

32:00.357 --> 32:02.788
<i>You may have never</i>
<i>murdered anyone, Orlando,</i>

32:02.823 --> 32:06.493
<i>but you have taken more lives</i>
<i>than I could ever dream of.</i>

32:08.232 --> 32:10.395
You're gonna pay for this,
you son of a bitch.

32:10.431 --> 32:13.533
- You're gonna pay for this.
-<i> Am I?</i>

32:13.569 --> 32:16.069
<i>You're the one with enough</i>
<i>C4 strapped to your ass</i>

32:16.104 --> 32:17.371
<i>to be the first man on Mars.</i>

32:19.338 --> 32:23.114
<i>Sorry, I just couldn't resist.</i>

32:27.416 --> 32:29.783
<i>All right, come on,</i>
<i>let's cut the shit.</i>

32:29.819 --> 32:33.892
<i>LCPD response time</i>
<i>to something of our nature</i>
<i>post-9/11 is seven minutes.</i>

32:33.927 --> 32:36.628
<i>With Christmas traffic,</i>
<i>we've got 15 max.</i>

32:36.663 --> 32:37.963
<i> How do you know?</i>

32:37.999 --> 32:40.164
<i> That bomb</i>
<i>in the park this morning?</i>

32:42.869 --> 32:44.395
<i>You gotta test</i>
<i>these things out,</i>

32:44.431 --> 32:47.371
<i>or they might go-- Bang!</i>

32:47.406 --> 32:50.303
<i>Just be glad it was</i>
<i>your old pal Victor</i>
<i>and not you.</i>

32:50.339 --> 32:54.411
- Victor?
<i>- Or should I say V-Havoc?</i>

32:54.446 --> 32:57.610
<i>You two were quite</i>
<i>the black hat team</i>
<i>back in the day.</i>

33:03.984 --> 33:07.059
<i>Neither one of you got</i>
<i>the sentence you deserved,</i>
<i>did you?</i>

33:10.292 --> 33:12.257
<i>Thought he was</i>
<i>absolved from sin.</i>

33:12.292 --> 33:14.494
<i>Back to the daily routine.</i>

33:14.529 --> 33:20.270
<i>Six AM jog,- 45 coffee,</i>
<i>- 15 news in the park.</i>

33:21.840 --> 33:23.842
<i>We are creatures of habit,</i>

33:23.877 --> 33:26.271
<i>a blessing and a curse,</i>
<i>I suppose.</i>

33:26.306 --> 33:29.377
So what is this, a vendetta?

33:29.412 --> 33:31.783
<i>As far as you're concerned,</i>
<i>this is a job.</i>

33:31.819 --> 33:33.850
<i>A job I've spent</i>
<i>a very long time</i>

33:33.885 --> 33:36.383
<i>studying your habits for.</i>

33:36.418 --> 33:38.585
<i>You really should spend</i>
<i>more time at home.</i>

33:39.919 --> 33:42.694
<i>I'm guessing you wish</i>
<i>you could fix</i>
<i>that marriage of yours</i>

33:42.729 --> 33:46.824
<i>if you just had</i>
<i>one more shot.</i>

33:53.299 --> 33:55.635
Two million dollars.

33:56.504 --> 34:00.310
You can go retire
on an island somewhere.

34:00.345 --> 34:04.014
<i>You can't retire</i>
<i>on two million</i>
<i>in this economy.</i>

34:04.050 --> 34:06.683
<i>Besides,</i>
<i>that money wasn't for me,</i>

34:06.719 --> 34:08.351
<i>that was for you.</i>

34:10.391 --> 34:11.288
Oh, shit.

34:12.956 --> 34:14.152
What have you done?

34:14.187 --> 34:16.192
<i>You earned it.</i>

34:16.227 --> 34:19.692
<i>The police would agree,</i>
<i>but I want more.</i>

34:27.039 --> 34:29.671
Templar Bonds?
I don't understand.

34:29.706 --> 34:32.736
You-you just had
access to a bank.
Why would you want bonds?

34:32.772 --> 34:35.439
<i>I don't give a shit</i>
<i>about bonds, you idiot.</i>

34:35.474 --> 34:38.877
<i>I want to own the owners.</i>

34:38.913 --> 34:42.152
<i>I want all the little pigs</i>
<i>to live in fear for a change.</i>

34:42.187 --> 34:44.882
<i>I want my boots</i>
<i>on their fucking neck.</i>

34:44.917 --> 34:48.590
<i>I want their money,</i>
<i>I want their information,</i>

34:48.625 --> 34:53.599
<i>locked away in their little</i>
<i>security deposit boxes.</i>

34:53.634 --> 34:55.529
You want their servers.

34:55.565 --> 34:57.334
<i>And the only way to those</i>
<i>with access codes</i>

34:57.369 --> 34:59.897
<i>on individually encrypted</i>
<i>drives in those boxes.</i>

35:01.675 --> 35:03.034
<i>Perfectly untraceable.</i>

35:03.069 --> 35:05.970
<i>All within an arm's reach</i>
<i>of a six-point</i>
<i>security grid,</i>

35:06.006 --> 35:09.044
<i>a grid that you</i>
<i>will infiltrate</i>
<i>and diffuse for me</i>

35:09.079 --> 35:12.250
<i>before it locks in 60 minutes.</i>

35:13.415 --> 35:16.650
- You're crazy.
-<i> I'm an optimist.</i>

35:18.350 --> 35:20.257
I need more prep.

35:20.293 --> 35:22.654
- I need more gear.
-<i> The more time you waste,</i>

35:22.690 --> 35:25.426
<i>the sooner SWAT bursts in,</i>
<i>guns blazing.</i>

35:25.461 --> 35:27.364
<i>You think they'll</i>
<i>ask questions first?</i>

35:36.069 --> 35:37.170
<i>Well?</i>

35:37.205 --> 35:40.104
All right, I'll do it.

35:40.139 --> 35:41.807
<i>Good boy.</i>

35:48.921 --> 35:50.318
What the fuck are you doing?

35:50.354 --> 35:53.220
I don't know
what you're talking about.

35:53.255 --> 35:54.919
<i>You spelled "hostage" wrong.</i>

35:56.522 --> 35:58.593
<i>You hit send, I kill Zoey.</i>

36:04.533 --> 36:06.633
Look, I just wanna
let 'em know I'm okay.

36:06.668 --> 36:09.675
<i>You think I'm an idiot,</i>
<i>you Ivy League prick?</i>

36:09.710 --> 36:11.204
<i>Take this as a fact.</i>

36:11.239 --> 36:14.773
<i>I am smarter than you.</i>

36:14.809 --> 36:18.613
<i>If you deviate again,</i>
<i>I'm going to blow your ass up.</i>

36:19.981 --> 36:22.579
<i>And after they've collected</i>
<i>as much of you as they can,</i>

36:22.614 --> 36:24.683
<i>your beautiful little Zoey,</i>

36:24.719 --> 36:27.653
<i>oh, she'll cry</i>
<i>her little brown eyes out</i>

36:27.689 --> 36:30.821
<i>at Daddy's funeral.</i>
<i> Daddy, Daddy...</i>

36:30.856 --> 36:33.124
<i>Only your casket's</i>
<i>gonna be wired with C4.</i>

36:33.159 --> 36:36.134
<i>And then I'll drive</i>
<i>to your parents' house,</i>
<i>Ruth and Ben,</i>

36:36.170 --> 36:38.869
<i>on 801 Center Street</i>
<i>and kill them, too.</i>

36:38.904 --> 36:40.998
<i>Do I need to keep going?</i>

36:42.235 --> 36:44.336
<i>I own you.</i>

36:44.371 --> 36:48.613
<i>Say it. "I own you."</i>

36:48.648 --> 36:50.881
You own me.

36:50.916 --> 36:54.319
<i>That's right. Good.</i>

36:55.781 --> 36:58.454
<i>Now that we're on</i>
<i>the same page,</i>

36:58.489 --> 37:00.988
<i>after you penetrate</i>
<i>the first five levels,</i>

37:01.023 --> 37:04.425
<i>I will deactivate the bomb</i>
<i>for you to complete</i>
<i>the mission.</i>

37:04.460 --> 37:06.194
Do you have any idea
how many people

37:06.229 --> 37:07.462
will be guarding
these servers?

37:07.497 --> 37:10.061
<i>Hey, Orlando? Use</i>
<i>that big brain of yours</i>

37:10.097 --> 37:13.866
<i>and tell me,</i>
<i>what company runs IT</i>
<i>for Templar Bonds?</i>

37:17.709 --> 37:19.036
We do.

37:20.008 --> 37:21.412
<i>Ah!</i>

37:22.582 --> 37:23.612
Okay.

37:24.580 --> 37:27.718
We could do a payload drop
to cut lurkers.

37:27.753 --> 37:30.616
But even if we get through
the first five parts
of the security grid,

37:30.651 --> 37:32.387
there's no way
to get through the last

37:32.422 --> 37:34.524
without clearance codes
from a human.

37:35.459 --> 37:38.426
<i>But the forums say</i>
<i>Red Knight is a legend.</i>

37:38.462 --> 37:40.963
Look, I don't care
what the forums say.

37:40.998 --> 37:42.265
It is what it is.

37:42.301 --> 37:45.535
<i>You do your part,</i>
<i>I will do mine.</i>

38:01.380 --> 38:02.847
<i>What is that?</i>

38:02.882 --> 38:05.918
Something to help me
move a little faster.

38:09.288 --> 38:10.659
Okay.

38:12.196 --> 38:13.761
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

38:35.321 --> 38:37.554
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

38:49.369 --> 38:50.799
They say
you're afraid of heights.

38:50.834 --> 38:53.733
Well, they're not my favorite.
That doesn't look too big.

38:53.769 --> 38:56.805
Hey, pro tip, skydiving
will take care of that.

38:56.841 --> 39:00.006
Yeah, I'm not
jumping out of a plane
unless it's on fire.

39:00.042 --> 39:01.513
Yo!

39:01.548 --> 39:05.743
Desk jockeys,
you don't have clearance,
30-plus yards back.

39:05.778 --> 39:07.678
I'd say 60,
at least 60 yards.

39:07.714 --> 39:09.180
That's--
That's the debris zone.

39:09.215 --> 39:11.384
Where you're standing right now,
we call that the vapor zone.

39:11.419 --> 39:12.820
How you doin', Tobias?

39:12.856 --> 39:14.623
My bomb squad
might not carry
the weight of twat.

39:14.659 --> 39:16.593
Not the guys
you want to piss off,
you know,

39:16.629 --> 39:19.127
'cause you guys be like,
tick, tick, tick,
tick, tick...

39:20.466 --> 39:23.267
Oh, if you're
the bomb squad guys,
then blow me.

39:23.302 --> 39:24.528
Get the fuck in there.
We got briefing.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.438
I hope it's brief.

39:37.046 --> 39:38.342
Ow...

39:38.377 --> 39:39.444
What...?

39:39.480 --> 39:42.446
Ava. Ava, you okay?

39:42.482 --> 39:44.181
What happened?

39:45.256 --> 39:46.522
I need you to stay calm,
okay?

39:46.557 --> 39:48.185
I gotta finish
what I'm doing over here.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.958
-<i> What's going on?</i>
- It's the girl. She's alive.

39:51.994 --> 39:54.730
<i>Who gives a shit?</i>
<i>Focus on the task</i>
<i>at hand.</i>

40:08.177 --> 40:09.679
I got ya.

40:15.381 --> 40:17.181
Uh-oh.

40:22.257 --> 40:23.525
Hey, uh...

40:23.560 --> 40:25.959
Hey, we got
a situation over here.

40:36.075 --> 40:38.903
Hey, asshole, wake up.

40:38.939 --> 40:40.876
<i>Well, that's no way</i>
<i>to talk to me.</i>

40:40.911 --> 40:44.243
I need to get out of this chair
to get that fire extinguisher.

40:44.278 --> 40:45.716
<i>No chance.</i>

40:45.751 --> 40:47.649
If these sprinklers go off,
it's gonna crash everything.

40:47.684 --> 40:50.584
<i>Too bad.</i>
<i>Your computer dies, you die.</i>

40:50.619 --> 40:52.222
- Hey, Ava.

40:52.258 --> 40:53.992
I need you
to put out that fire.

40:54.027 --> 40:55.719
Can you do that for me?

41:02.765 --> 41:04.932
<i>Let's hope her legs</i>
<i>aren't broken.</i>

41:07.975 --> 41:09.739
<i>Come on, come on.</i>

41:15.811 --> 41:18.682
<i>Don't let those</i>
<i>sprinklers go off.</i>

41:22.516 --> 41:24.523
<i>There you go.</i>

41:25.518 --> 41:27.752
<i>Good girl.</i>

41:31.531 --> 41:34.597
<i>Goddamn, I love</i>
<i>watching humans</i>
<i>face pressure.</i>

41:34.632 --> 41:37.699
<i>Do they adapt, or do they</i>
<i>shrivel up and wilt,</i>

41:37.734 --> 41:39.963

<i>Orlando, grab the handcuffs</i>

<i>Girl, go cuff yourself</i>

42:03.391 --> 42:04.662
I'm sorry.

42:09.565 --> 42:11.735
Can I trust you?

42:15.537 --> 42:17.337
It's time to fight back.

42:40.199 --> 42:41.765
I'm gonna open this one.

42:42.534 --> 42:44.594
- Here you go.

42:44.630 --> 42:46.370
Thank you.

42:46.406 --> 42:48.271
Oh, look.
Look how cute this is.

42:52.905 --> 42:54.378
<i>Hey, Orlando.</i>

<i>they call this a false flag.</i>

43:39.559 --> 43:41.319
<i>Get your eyes</i>
<i>off the real killer.</i>

43:46.266 --> 43:48.197
<i>You should be thanking me.</i>

43:48.232 --> 43:51.602
<i>Now they're worried about</i>
<i>a wildcard Ted Kaczynski</i>
<i>up here.</i>

43:51.637 --> 43:54.303
<i>They won't send in</i>
<i>the cavalry as fast.</i>

43:54.338 --> 43:55.640
<i>You're welcome.</i>

43:55.676 --> 43:57.504
All right, guys,
no bullshit zone here.

43:57.540 --> 43:58.935
These are the facts.

43:58.971 --> 44:01.344
Our perp is Orlando Friar.

44:01.380 --> 44:02.580
Active on the tenth floor.

44:02.615 --> 44:05.042
This fuck has a bone
to pick with the city.

44:05.078 --> 44:07.046
Let's discuss
asset elimination.

44:07.081 --> 44:09.984
- Quite a way to put it.
- Yeah, knee slapper.

44:10.020 --> 44:12.586
Look, I got two fire teams
ready to bust his ass

44:12.622 --> 44:13.918
before he knows what's up.

44:13.953 --> 44:15.626
I can get in position
anytime.

44:15.661 --> 44:17.792
- Just say the words.
- Does he got a family?

44:17.828 --> 44:19.091
Yeah, wife
and kid en route.

44:19.126 --> 44:21.525
Wouldn't be
the first psycho with kids.

44:21.560 --> 44:24.566
Just want to weigh our options
before we orphan his baby.

44:24.601 --> 44:26.665
Oh, yeah,
what do you suggest?

44:26.700 --> 44:28.438
Well, I don't know.

44:28.473 --> 44:30.870
Full tech sweep.
Get a visual.

44:30.906 --> 44:32.338
You know, see
what we're up against.

44:32.373 --> 44:34.774
I can get up and let you know
what I see through my sights.

44:34.809 --> 44:36.975
Damn, bomb squad
cheese dicks

44:37.010 --> 44:38.447
always wanting
the glory, huh?

44:38.482 --> 44:40.147
Typical. How about this?

44:40.182 --> 44:42.779
We strike, kill the fucker
before he stings again,

44:42.815 --> 44:44.320
like a real man.

44:44.355 --> 44:45.315
Hey, no glory shit.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.084
I mean, just the x-factor
of, I don't know,

44:47.119 --> 44:49.455
maybe a building
wired to blow up.

44:49.491 --> 44:50.627
Bullshit.

44:50.663 --> 44:52.188
Cut the shit,
Sergeant.

44:52.224 --> 44:53.996
Lance, get
our eye in the sky up.

44:54.031 --> 44:56.230
Copy that, Chief.
I'll let you know
when I get there.

44:56.265 --> 44:59.463
All right, I want
a confirmation
of contact and demands

44:59.498 --> 45:02.132
before trigger pull.
Wallace, you got
first swing.

45:02.168 --> 45:04.406
Secure ground level
and report back.

45:04.441 --> 45:05.977
Oh, thanks, Chief.

45:06.012 --> 45:08.978
Tobias, I want contact
with the building manager,
all right?

45:10.912 --> 45:14.051
- Now! Go.
- You got it, ma'am.

45:20.292 --> 45:21.452
Thanks, buddy.

45:22.320 --> 45:25.594
Hey, why ask that shit
about his family?

45:25.630 --> 45:27.994
- Why do you care?
- I don't.

45:28.029 --> 45:30.263
Other than a hacker,
he ain't a bomber.

45:39.107 --> 45:40.971
<i> Hostiles headed</i>
<i>toward the lobby.</i>

45:41.007 --> 45:43.045
<i>- Better hurry.</i>
- Shit.

45:49.555 --> 45:51.850
<i>And guess who else</i>
<i>just got here.</i>

45:51.885 --> 45:53.889
Oh, my God.

45:57.991 --> 45:59.923
<i> Hello?</i>
<i>Orlando--</i>

46:11.872 --> 46:14.142
On her birthday, too.

46:15.010 --> 46:17.981
It's my daughter's
birthday today.

46:20.880 --> 46:23.118
And...

46:23.954 --> 46:26.385
what if you're there
for the next one, right?

46:29.122 --> 46:31.962
- Yeah.
- The one after that?

46:36.130 --> 46:40.036
You get your ass
up off that chair.

46:42.275 --> 46:44.134
Figuratively.

46:44.170 --> 46:46.878
Get us the hell
out of here.

46:48.513 --> 46:50.046
All right.

46:59.587 --> 47:02.756
<i>We've yet to receive any more</i>
<i>information on Orlando Friar,</i>

47:02.791 --> 47:04.561
<i>the man holed up inside.</i>

47:04.596 --> 47:05.896
<i>However, we are being told</i>

47:05.932 --> 47:07.996
<i>that authorities</i>
<i>are bringing down his family</i>

47:08.031 --> 47:09.934
<i>in hopes to establish</i>
<i>communication.</i>

47:13.904 --> 47:16.767
<i> Lots of windows</i>
<i>up here, huh?</i>

47:16.803 --> 47:18.905
<i>Take a look.</i>

47:18.940 --> 47:21.104
<i>Might as well wave.</i>

47:21.139 --> 47:22.507
<i>By now, tactical protocols</i>

47:22.542 --> 47:25.246
<i>will have at least</i>
<i>three trained shooters</i>
<i>right on you.</i>

47:26.913 --> 47:28.914
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

47:46.772 --> 47:49.039
I'm in position,
locked and loaded.

47:50.476 --> 47:52.237
Target is in sight.

47:52.272 --> 47:55.309
Seems to just be sitting
at his computer.

47:58.082 --> 48:02.350
<i>Heh. You are lucky we're</i>
<i>in such a sensitive age.</i>

48:02.385 --> 48:04.782
<i>They don't want to blow</i>
<i>your brains out on live TV.</i>

48:06.557 --> 48:08.993
<i>Well, it seems that we've</i>
<i>reached the next phase</i>
<i>of our game,</i>

48:09.028 --> 48:11.759
<i>because now they're finally</i>
<i>taking us seriously.</i>

48:11.794 --> 48:15.032
<i>Time for the confession.</i>

48:25.879 --> 48:28.040
<i>Record a video reading</i>
<i>that exact message</i>

48:28.075 --> 48:30.146
<i>and stream it to the world.</i>

48:34.347 --> 48:36.954
I want to talk
to my family first.

48:36.989 --> 48:39.655
<i>- Not a chance.</i>
- You want me to read this?

48:39.691 --> 48:41.988
I talk to my family first.

48:42.023 --> 48:44.824
<i>- Or what?</i>
- Or I'm done.

48:48.396 --> 48:50.131
<i>You know, you are</i>
<i>a real piece of shit,</i>

48:50.166 --> 48:51.963
<i>but you do care</i>
<i>about your daughter.</i>

48:51.998 --> 48:53.637
<i>I respect that.</i>

48:53.672 --> 48:55.270
Oh, what? We're buddies now?

48:55.305 --> 48:58.541
Let me guess, you got
some kind of a daddy issue?

49:01.244 --> 49:05.148
<i>My relationship</i>
<i>with my father is...</i>
<i>complicated.</i>

49:05.183 --> 49:07.711
<i>When he wasn't busy drinking</i>
<i>and kicking my ass,</i>

49:07.746 --> 49:09.718
<i>we did have a bit</i>
<i>of a green thumb growing up.</i>

49:09.753 --> 49:12.053
<i>You see, planter soil,</i>

49:12.089 --> 49:14.256
<i>it's a great place</i>
<i>to hide a bomb.</i>

49:15.829 --> 49:17.556
<i>And the best part</i>
<i>about 24/7 news</i>

49:17.592 --> 49:19.890
<i>is that the bad guys</i>
<i>get to watch it all the same.</i>

49:19.925 --> 49:22.593
<i>So the first thing</i>
<i>they do in our situation</i>
<i>is sweep the area,</i>

49:22.628 --> 49:25.870
<i>but a fertilizer bomb,</i>
<i>that doesn't show up</i>

49:25.905 --> 49:27.937
<i>when it's under</i>
<i>a few feet of soil.</i>

49:27.972 --> 49:29.807
<i>So you read</i>
<i>that confession now,</i>

49:29.842 --> 49:31.741
<i>or I press</i>
<i>my little red button</i>

49:31.776 --> 49:33.874
<i>and turn your family</i>
<i>into soup.</i>

49:33.910 --> 49:36.113
All right, enough, enough.

49:40.279 --> 49:42.152
You want me to read this?

49:42.985 --> 49:45.951
<i>Yes, that would be great.</i>

49:45.986 --> 49:48.320
<i>Oh, and Orlando,</i>

49:48.356 --> 49:50.091
<i>let's take it light</i>
<i>on the improv.</i>

49:50.127 --> 49:54.993
<i>I'm a real stickler</i>
<i>for my words.</i>

49:55.029 --> 49:58.800
<i>I'm being told</i>
<i>that we're getting a call</i>
<i>from within Hudson Tower.</i>

49:58.835 --> 50:02.266
<i>It could possibly be</i>
<i>that there is someone</i>
<i>trapped inside the building.</i>

50:02.301 --> 50:04.075
<i>Caller, what is your name?</i>

50:05.276 --> 50:07.307
<i> This is the man</i>
<i>on the tenth floor.</i>

50:07.342 --> 50:09.547
<i>I want you to go live</i>
<i>with this feed</i>

50:09.582 --> 50:11.049
<i>I'm about to send you.</i>

50:19.524 --> 50:21.154
Hey, Zoey.

50:21.189 --> 50:22.788
My partner,
Officer Jackson here,

50:22.823 --> 50:25.328
he wants to ask you
a few questions.
It's kind of stuffy in here.

50:25.363 --> 50:27.696
Why don't you go out
and get some fresh air,
maybe a snack?

50:27.731 --> 50:29.164
What do you think?

50:29.200 --> 50:31.566
- What do you feel like?
- It's okay. You can go.

50:31.601 --> 50:32.664
Yeah?

50:38.705 --> 50:42.377
- No job too small, hero.
- Not even babysitting.

50:45.148 --> 50:48.582
Ma'am... Chief wants
to talk to you.

50:48.618 --> 50:52.222
Ms. Friar, I need
to know everything
about your husband,

50:52.257 --> 50:55.252
and if he's capable
of doing something
like this.

50:55.287 --> 50:57.561
No, this isn't Orlando.

50:57.597 --> 50:59.160
Well, he has record.

50:59.195 --> 51:01.194
Yeah, I'm aware
of his record, okay?

51:01.229 --> 51:03.865
And yes,
he has some red marks,

51:03.901 --> 51:06.170
but he's tried to change,

51:06.205 --> 51:09.902
and he's worked really hard
to turn things around.

51:09.937 --> 51:11.474
He's trying.

51:11.509 --> 51:15.212
So he was going
to be prosecuted
before he turned witness?

51:16.977 --> 51:18.578
Um, yeah.

51:19.750 --> 51:21.383
It was, um...

51:22.149 --> 51:24.049
I was planning, um...

51:24.084 --> 51:26.586
on giving him a...

51:28.155 --> 51:30.090
But this isn't Orlando.

51:30.126 --> 51:32.625
- I know.
- How do you know?

51:32.660 --> 51:37.596
Because Orlando has made
some really stupid mistakes,

51:37.632 --> 51:40.836
but the one thing
he wouldn't risk losing
is Zoey.

51:40.871 --> 51:42.171
See, that works for me.

51:42.206 --> 51:44.204
Doesn't fit the profile
of a gig like this.

51:44.239 --> 51:46.106
We're going off
present intel.

51:46.142 --> 51:48.006
I called
and he tried to call me.

51:48.042 --> 51:49.911
Um, I missed it.

51:52.017 --> 51:53.912
Chief, you gotta
look at this here.

51:53.947 --> 51:55.318
Heads up.

51:56.085 --> 51:58.916
<i>My name is Orlando Friar.</i>

51:58.952 --> 52:02.351
<i>I am the person responsible</i>
<i>for the bombing in the park</i>

52:02.387 --> 52:04.721
<i>and Hudson Towers.</i>

52:04.756 --> 52:07.094
<i>There are more bombs</i>
<i>in the building</i>

52:07.129 --> 52:09.429
<i>and hidden throughout the city.</i>

52:09.465 --> 52:12.596
<i>Any more intrusions</i>
<i>from unwanted guests</i>

52:12.632 --> 52:15.672
<i>will result</i>
<i>in hundreds of deaths.</i>

52:15.708 --> 52:17.736
<i>I hope I am clear.</i>

52:19.174 --> 52:21.672
<i>I have lied to all of you,</i>

52:21.707 --> 52:24.710
<i>to my wife, Kim,</i>
<i>to my daughter, Zoey.</i>

52:25.912 --> 52:29.017
I helped orchestrate one
of the worst financial
deceptions

52:29.053 --> 52:30.914
in public trust
in our history.

52:31.849 --> 52:34.390
<i>First, I want to set</i>
<i>some ground rules.</i>

52:36.223 --> 52:37.888
<i>I am prepared to die.</i>

52:39.328 --> 52:41.496
<i>I am hooked</i>
<i>to a dead man's switch.</i>

52:42.763 --> 52:46.663
<i>If you kill me,</i>
<i>it will trigger all bombs...</i>

52:46.699 --> 52:49.207
<i>and it will be</i>
<i>a bloody Christmas.</i>

52:50.576 --> 52:52.873
Kim, Zoey...

52:52.909 --> 52:54.078
<i>I love you!</i>

52:54.113 --> 52:55.741
- I'm sorry--

52:58.314 --> 53:01.682
This is not Orlando.
He is terrified.

53:01.717 --> 53:04.219
- Get every single bomb tech
ready to breach.
- On it.

53:04.254 --> 53:06.290
All right, SWAT,
prep for assault.

53:07.419 --> 53:08.826
- Wait--
- Let's go.

53:08.861 --> 53:10.623
Please,
just listen to me.

53:10.659 --> 53:13.327
<i>What the hell</i>
<i>were you thinking?</i>

53:13.362 --> 53:15.364
<i>Do you want</i>
<i>your family to die?</i>

53:15.399 --> 53:17.563
<i>I told you to read</i>
<i>exactly what was</i>
<i>on that page!</i>

53:17.598 --> 53:20.268
<i>A man ready</i>
<i>to blow himself up</i>
<i>doesn't waver.</i>

53:20.303 --> 53:22.505
And what are you
gonna do about it?

53:22.541 --> 53:25.710
<i>Oh, you think there's a way</i>
<i>out of this, motherfucker?!</i>

53:25.745 --> 53:29.808
<i>You think I won't hunt you</i>
<i>and your shitty little family</i>
<i>down again?</i>

53:36.150 --> 53:37.717
<i>Clock's ticking.</i>

53:44.127 --> 53:46.363
What were you talking about?

53:54.434 --> 53:57.639
Two years ago,
uh, Orlando,

53:57.675 --> 54:00.972
he signed on with a--
with a big bucks
New York startup.

54:01.008 --> 54:05.346
Okay? And they paid
all of our bills,
and it was better

54:05.381 --> 54:07.516
than Orlando's former
life in hacking.

54:08.648 --> 54:11.385
Investment bankers,
old retirees.

54:11.420 --> 54:14.088
Anyone with portfolios
was welcome.

54:14.124 --> 54:17.493
Old money, New York money.

54:17.528 --> 54:20.291
It was all supposed to be
regulated, by the books.

54:20.327 --> 54:22.396
But we soon realized

54:22.431 --> 54:25.029
why they wanted Orlando
so badly.

54:25.065 --> 54:30.907
They used me
to crack into phones,
to break into servers.

54:30.943 --> 54:32.772
Anything to gain an edge.

54:34.313 --> 54:36.072
I thought it was just
data mining for them.

54:37.242 --> 54:40.783
But it turns out
they were hacking into
people's savings...

54:40.818 --> 54:43.354
their 401ks.

54:44.120 --> 54:45.719
And you didn't know?

54:47.593 --> 54:48.755
I, uh...

54:51.490 --> 54:54.464
I was willfully naive.

54:55.232 --> 54:57.299
I mean, these were
powerful people.

54:57.334 --> 55:00.899
You know, Wall Street,
politicians.

55:03.074 --> 55:04.374
Once the Feds got involved,

55:04.410 --> 55:07.172
I couldn't outright let them
rob anyone anymore.

55:07.208 --> 55:08.604
And what about--

55:08.640 --> 55:10.511
The people who bought in?

55:10.546 --> 55:14.414
Broke, and eaten by
the system they trusted.

55:14.449 --> 55:16.315
And it wasn't
just rich investors,

55:16.350 --> 55:19.586
it was regular people.

55:19.621 --> 55:23.024
Their futures,
their pensions, just gone.

55:23.060 --> 55:24.623
I worked for crooks

55:24.659 --> 55:28.229
who spent it
as fast as they stole it.

55:28.264 --> 55:30.498
There was nothing to give back.

55:30.533 --> 55:33.899
No way to give these people
their lives back.

55:35.171 --> 55:37.408
We put the bosses away.

55:39.178 --> 55:41.577
And me and my partner
took a deal.

55:46.412 --> 55:47.845
I took a deal.

55:47.880 --> 55:51.422
You did what you had to
for your family.

55:55.327 --> 55:56.992
When he found out
what they were doing,

55:57.027 --> 55:58.226
he turned them in.

55:58.261 --> 55:59.526
He didn't think
about himself

55:59.561 --> 56:02.364
or the family
he was about to lose.

56:02.399 --> 56:05.535
And we left the city
and we moved here.

56:06.465 --> 56:07.767
He lied to me,

56:07.803 --> 56:10.774
but, um, he did
the right thing
in the end.

56:10.810 --> 56:13.075
He's a good man.

56:13.111 --> 56:14.739
- He is.

56:14.774 --> 56:16.439
Locked
and loaded, Chief.

56:16.474 --> 56:17.708
Green light.

56:17.743 --> 56:19.316
Green light?
What is happening?

56:19.351 --> 56:20.914
All right, you need
to go outside, please.

56:20.949 --> 56:23.518
- Please don't hurt my husband.
- Listen, it's not up to us.

56:23.553 --> 56:25.549
It's up to him.
He can either end this now

56:25.584 --> 56:26.886
or we'll end it for him.

56:30.227 --> 56:32.155
Can somebody get her outside?

56:33.492 --> 56:34.894
- Mom.
- Zoey.

56:34.930 --> 56:37.699
Did you tell them about
the message that Dad left us?

56:37.734 --> 56:40.702
Yeah-- yes, he-he-he
called and he left a message,

56:40.738 --> 56:43.400
and, um, it sounds
like there's someone
in the background.

56:43.435 --> 56:44.605
Just listen.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.441
Hey, hey, everyone,
keep it down, will you?

56:46.477 --> 56:49.444
<i>Hey, Orlando, you're famous.</i>

56:49.479 --> 56:50.975
- <i> Oh, my God.</i>
- I hear him.

56:51.010 --> 56:53.614
I hear there's somebody there
talking to him.

56:53.649 --> 56:55.783
All right, we'll take it
into consideration.

56:55.818 --> 56:58.852
- Will you help my dad?
- Yeah, we'll do our best. Here.

57:00.252 --> 57:02.788
I tried to reach
the building manager,
Edmond Harris.

57:02.823 --> 57:05.489
No one knows where he is.
Even his family.

57:05.525 --> 57:06.827
Could be the bomber.

57:08.200 --> 57:09.463
Chief, we gotta take
this fucker

57:09.499 --> 57:11.161
before anybody else
dies today.

57:11.196 --> 57:13.537
He says he's got a dead man's
switch ready to blow.

57:13.572 --> 57:16.306
If we kill him, who knows
how many more could die?

57:16.341 --> 57:17.701
That voice we just heard
on the phone,

57:17.736 --> 57:19.175
he could be calling the shots.

57:19.210 --> 57:21.070
You want to take that chance?

57:21.105 --> 57:24.812
Now do you think
maybe Orlando's the patsy?

57:24.847 --> 57:27.512
Chief, you read the sitrep.
it's a fucking bluff!

57:27.547 --> 57:31.752
We're not gonna sit here
and listen to these old, washed
up bomb squad guys

57:31.788 --> 57:33.723
that haven't recovered
from their fucked up past.

57:33.758 --> 57:36.554
Hey, that's not fair.
Jackson's not old
and washed up.

57:36.589 --> 57:38.188
Okay, shut the fuck up.

57:39.492 --> 57:40.957
Christmas '96,

57:40.992 --> 57:44.662
first call,
domestic disturbance.

57:44.698 --> 57:46.335
Guy said
that if we made a move,

57:46.371 --> 57:48.499
he'd blow the house,
kids at all.

57:48.534 --> 57:52.307
Do you know how many times
I would have said
that idiot was bluffing?

57:52.342 --> 57:54.637
How many times I was wrong?

57:54.673 --> 57:56.540
It's not your call.

57:56.576 --> 57:57.913
And it's not yours.

57:59.115 --> 58:00.683
It's mine.

58:00.718 --> 58:02.916
The queen's the most valuable
player on the board.

58:02.951 --> 58:05.853
Just check the facts.
What's the next move, Chief?

58:11.792 --> 58:14.026
Okay, I'm through
the fourth wall.

58:23.107 --> 58:25.807
- Shit!
- Shit?

58:27.212 --> 58:28.878
It's high-level encryption.

58:28.914 --> 58:29.974
How high?

58:30.010 --> 58:33.413
Well, if the Pentagon
is a ten, it's a 12.5.

58:33.448 --> 58:36.152
Can-can you crack it?

58:36.187 --> 58:37.786
I ain't got no choice.

58:45.831 --> 58:46.658
Holding.

58:46.693 --> 58:48.632
<i> By your command.</i>

59:10.488 --> 59:12.117
Red light, red light,
stand down.

59:13.354 --> 59:14.724
Roger that.

59:22.162 --> 59:24.602
Don't get too comfortable,
Wallace, you're up to bat.

59:26.531 --> 59:27.770
Good.

59:35.477 --> 59:36.611
No, no, don't wait up.

59:36.646 --> 59:38.043
Working late,
big shindig, you'll see.

59:38.078 --> 59:40.877
Make sure the milkman's gone
before I get back.

59:40.912 --> 59:43.781
I wish you
a Merry Christmas.

59:43.817 --> 59:45.682
I wish you
a Merry Christmas

59:45.718 --> 59:48.221
and Happy New Year.

59:49.258 --> 59:51.024
Later, baby.

59:52.629 --> 59:54.726
You sing Christmas songs
to your wife?

59:54.762 --> 59:56.331
Oh, yeah,
she's kinky that way.

59:56.366 --> 59:57.894
You know what they say,

59:57.930 --> 1:00:00.068
calling before a job
is bad luck.

1:00:00.103 --> 1:00:01.499
Who says?

1:00:01.534 --> 1:00:03.273
The movies.

1:00:03.308 --> 1:00:05.136
Yeah, guy calls his old lady,

1:00:05.172 --> 1:00:07.741
next thing you know,
it's curtains for that guy.

1:00:07.776 --> 1:00:09.338
As a bomb guy,
you savor every moment.

1:00:09.373 --> 1:00:11.847
- You got anyone
you need to call?
- Nah.

1:00:19.686 --> 1:00:21.154
What the hell was that?

1:00:21.189 --> 1:00:23.455
<i>Protocol. They cut power</i>
<i>before they burst in firing.</i>

1:00:23.491 --> 1:00:25.095
<i>Finish the job.</i>

1:00:26.259 --> 1:00:29.993
Oh, no--
I lost progress on lock five.

1:00:30.029 --> 1:00:33.370
<i>- Fix it!</i>
- Come on, Orlando.

1:00:33.405 --> 1:00:35.130
Come on, you got this.
Come on.

1:00:35.166 --> 1:00:37.004
Shh. Let me think,
let me think.

1:00:44.883 --> 1:00:47.882
There's nothing in this room
strong enough to break it.

1:00:47.917 --> 1:00:50.784
Just figure it out,
okay? Just figure it out.

1:00:50.820 --> 1:00:52.389
There-there has to be
some hacker shit

1:00:52.425 --> 1:00:53.720
that you know
that you can use--

1:00:53.756 --> 1:00:56.054
<i>Come on! Mission victory</i>
<i>is in sight!</i>

1:00:56.089 --> 1:00:57.887
<i>- Life or death! You choose!</i>
Hey!

1:00:57.923 --> 1:00:59.355
You're as screwed as I am!

1:00:59.390 --> 1:01:01.527
If you could break in here
yourself, you would.

1:01:01.563 --> 1:01:03.499
Just figure it out!

1:01:03.535 --> 1:01:06.196
Okay. Stop, stop,
stop, stop...

1:01:06.231 --> 1:01:08.937
-<i> Figure it out already!</i>
- Shut up! Hold on!

1:01:12.310 --> 1:01:14.008
We got to flood it.

1:01:16.108 --> 1:01:18.680
It'll look like
a standard DDoS attack.

1:01:18.715 --> 1:01:20.514
We backdoor
the defense response.

1:01:20.549 --> 1:01:21.917
We flood the servers.

1:01:21.952 --> 1:01:24.920
Templar Bonds guard protocols
won't stand a chance.

1:01:26.285 --> 1:01:29.186
<i>Everything out there</i>
<i>is running on a network.</i>

1:01:29.221 --> 1:01:31.861
<i>All sending signals</i>
<i>to that network.</i>

1:01:33.261 --> 1:01:36.294
If I could redirect the signals,
we could send them all here.

1:01:37.631 --> 1:01:41.535
I could use the traffic
to overload their servers
and jam them up.

1:01:41.570 --> 1:01:43.334
This disables lock five.

1:01:45.008 --> 1:01:49.076
The only problem is,
traffic's gonna hit us, too.

1:01:50.743 --> 1:01:53.415
I need a shield.

1:02:27.845 --> 1:02:29.146
Tenth floor.

1:02:29.181 --> 1:02:31.882
I swear, if we take
this guy alive,

1:02:31.917 --> 1:02:34.818
I'm gonna kick his ass.

1:02:34.854 --> 1:02:36.052
Come on, Old Yeller.

1:02:36.087 --> 1:02:38.427
It ain't time
for pasture yet.

1:02:38.462 --> 1:02:39.760
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:02:39.795 --> 1:02:41.557
Yeah, your mom
wore me out earlier.

1:02:42.802 --> 1:02:45.429
My mom don't like older men.
Plus, she's racist.

1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:52.304
We're approaching the door.

1:02:53.675 --> 1:02:54.741
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

1:02:54.776 --> 1:02:56.206
There's somebody else in there.

1:02:56.241 --> 1:02:57.906
- A hostage?
- Yeah, maybe.

1:02:57.942 --> 1:02:59.916
It's fiber time.

1:03:24.672 --> 1:03:26.835
Whoa. Nice rig.

1:03:27.738 --> 1:03:32.381
You're telling me
a white collar hacker
on parole made that?

1:03:32.416 --> 1:03:33.543
Pretty high tech.

1:03:41.888 --> 1:03:43.289
Wallace, stop, pan back.

1:03:44.955 --> 1:03:46.193
<i>Pan back.</i>

1:03:48.366 --> 1:03:49.625
We got a hostage.

1:03:59.173 --> 1:04:01.138
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

1:04:01.173 --> 1:04:03.012
Red Knight
has to shield the Queen.

1:04:03.048 --> 1:04:05.644
If I unleash this attack,
we're right in the strike zone.

1:04:05.679 --> 1:04:08.380
<i>All right, well, come on, hurry</i>
<i>up. It shouldn't be</i>
<i>taking this long.</i>

1:04:16.020 --> 1:04:17.189
Chief.

1:04:17.224 --> 1:04:19.292
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We got something.

1:04:20.324 --> 1:04:21.995
Our assault team
is at base camp.

1:04:22.031 --> 1:04:24.999
We know Orlando
works on the tenth floor.

1:04:25.034 --> 1:04:27.267
Well, we're picking up
another heat signature.

1:04:28.967 --> 1:04:30.069
Where is that?

1:04:30.104 --> 1:04:31.541
It's inside one
of those server rooms.

1:04:31.577 --> 1:04:33.242
They're probably
hiding in there.

1:04:33.277 --> 1:04:37.306
You know, hoping
they would blend in
with the heat of the servers.

1:04:37.342 --> 1:04:39.141
This jackass
could be an accomplice,

1:04:39.177 --> 1:04:41.583
or someone controlling him.

1:04:41.618 --> 1:04:43.382
You gotta get this fucker.

1:04:49.894 --> 1:04:51.962
<i>Wallace, stop.</i>

1:04:51.997 --> 1:04:54.591
We got a possible
second suspect
in the building.

1:04:54.626 --> 1:04:56.593
It could be
our missing person,
Edmond Harris.

1:04:59.635 --> 1:05:00.999
You're shitting me.

1:05:01.034 --> 1:05:02.701
- A second voice.
- Yeah.

1:05:02.737 --> 1:05:05.202
We're fairly certain
that's where the other bombs
could be located.

1:05:05.237 --> 1:05:09.577
Don't tell me.
Fourth floor, right?

1:05:09.613 --> 1:05:11.278
<i>Server room. Why?</i>

1:05:11.313 --> 1:05:13.412
Well, that's the weakest part
in the building structure.

1:05:13.447 --> 1:05:16.784
<i>It could bring</i>
<i>the whole thing</i>
<i>down from there.</i>

1:05:16.819 --> 1:05:18.051
All right, SWAT's en route.

1:05:18.086 --> 1:05:19.587
<i>We need one of you</i>
<i>to meet them.</i>

1:05:19.623 --> 1:05:20.723
All right, I'm on it.

1:05:20.758 --> 1:05:22.485
- No, you stay here.

1:05:22.520 --> 1:05:24.419
Disarm that bomb.
I'll take care of it.

1:05:24.455 --> 1:05:27.062
Not a chance.
Come on, movies, man.

1:05:27.097 --> 1:05:29.999
Guys split up now,
it's curtains
for one of them.

1:05:30.035 --> 1:05:32.263
Listen, Old Yeller,
you're never gonna make it.

1:05:32.298 --> 1:05:34.471
Take care of this,
I'll handle that.

1:05:34.506 --> 1:05:35.738
It's like chess, man.

1:05:35.774 --> 1:05:37.235
It's not emotional.
I got this.

1:05:37.271 --> 1:05:40.240
All right.
Well, listen,
Action Jackson,

1:05:40.276 --> 1:05:42.743
you even get a whiff
of anything rotten,
you bail.

1:05:42.779 --> 1:05:44.813
- You hear me?
- Roger.

1:05:44.848 --> 1:05:46.946
Me and you got
unfinished business.

1:05:46.981 --> 1:05:48.744
- Click clack.
- Good luck.

1:05:50.217 --> 1:05:52.220
- I was born for this shit.
- Yeah.

1:05:56.895 --> 1:05:59.590
<i> Orlando,</i>
<i>get the cameras online.</i>

1:07:08.765 --> 1:07:10.298
He's trapped in there?

1:07:11.261 --> 1:07:12.630
Wallace, we got him.

1:07:14.773 --> 1:07:16.902
Hey, slow down,
kid, slow down.

1:07:16.937 --> 1:07:19.307
See the next move.

1:07:48.400 --> 1:07:50.005
<i>What are you doing?</i>

1:07:50.041 --> 1:07:52.907
<i>Flood the servers,</i>
<i>finish the job.</i>

1:07:52.942 --> 1:07:55.307
<i>Hey, asshole, guess what?</i>

1:07:55.342 --> 1:07:57.611
SWAT's about to knock
on your door.

1:07:57.646 --> 1:07:58.610
<i>What?</i>

1:08:11.729 --> 1:08:13.026
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

1:08:17.730 --> 1:08:19.829
Hey, hey, hey, give me
an update. What's the status?

1:08:21.398 --> 1:08:23.399
<i>Come on. Talk to me.</i>

1:08:23.435 --> 1:08:24.801
Don't you move,
asshole!

1:08:32.884 --> 1:08:35.678
I'm gonna visit you
in prison.

1:08:35.713 --> 1:08:38.416
I hope you like being
someone's prison bitch,

1:08:38.451 --> 1:08:40.454
'cause you're in
the hot seat now.

1:08:42.925 --> 1:08:44.157
What the hell is that?

1:08:44.193 --> 1:08:46.356
<i>I am not a crook.</i>

1:08:46.391 --> 1:08:48.693
<i>Death to the capitalist pig!</i>

1:08:51.300 --> 1:08:53.336
It's Edmund Harris,
our missing person.

1:08:53.371 --> 1:08:55.599
I tried to reach
the building manager,
Edmund Harris,

1:08:55.634 --> 1:08:57.669
no one knows where he is.
Even his family.

1:09:02.745 --> 1:09:03.774
Is that...?

1:09:09.988 --> 1:09:11.353
<i>He's dead, Wallace.</i>

1:09:15.288 --> 1:09:17.189
His eye is missing.

1:09:17.225 --> 1:09:19.755
<i> I am not a crook.</i>

1:09:19.791 --> 1:09:22.894
<i> Death</i>
<i>to the capitalist pig.</i>

1:09:26.133 --> 1:09:27.464
What the hell is that?

1:09:27.499 --> 1:09:29.701
It's a bomb!
Everybody get out!

1:09:43.352 --> 1:09:45.218
Give me eyes in there.
Can anyone read me?

1:09:45.253 --> 1:09:48.117
- Fuck.
- <i> Damnit!</i>

1:09:48.152 --> 1:09:49.622
Fuck.

1:09:53.292 --> 1:09:54.489
Jackson, you all right?

1:09:54.525 --> 1:09:57.733
Jackson, Jack-- Oh, fuck.

1:09:57.768 --> 1:09:59.834
Fuck me.

1:09:59.870 --> 1:10:01.296
Can anyone read me?

1:10:01.332 --> 1:10:03.471
Anyone? Damnit!

1:10:04.641 --> 1:10:06.104
Shit.

1:10:16.582 --> 1:10:18.420
Can you tell me
what happened?

1:10:21.218 --> 1:10:22.391
Hey!

1:10:23.760 --> 1:10:25.554
Is he alive?

1:10:25.589 --> 1:10:28.496
Don't ignore me!
Is he alive?

1:10:35.036 --> 1:10:36.632
Ava, you good?

1:10:36.667 --> 1:10:39.069
What the hell was that?

1:10:42.473 --> 1:10:44.512
I think they found him.

1:10:46.345 --> 1:10:47.911
I think they found him.

1:10:49.847 --> 1:10:51.948
<i> Oh, they found</i>
<i>something, all right.</i>

1:10:53.457 --> 1:10:56.251
<i>It won't be much of a problem</i>
<i>from here on out.</i>

1:11:02.365 --> 1:11:06.503
<i>How many must die</i>
<i>for a simple job?</i>

1:11:06.538 --> 1:11:12.006
<i>How many lives are you</i>
<i>going to destroy,</i>
<i>Red Knight?</i>

1:11:12.042 --> 1:11:14.170
Fuck you, you cocksucker!

1:11:14.206 --> 1:11:16.612
- It's not my fault,
you son of a bitch!

1:11:16.648 --> 1:11:20.245
<i>Oh, take responsibility</i>
<i>for once in your worthless</i>
<i>life,</i>

1:11:20.280 --> 1:11:22.319
<i>you pathetic little man.</i>

1:11:23.783 --> 1:11:27.918
<i>Really colorful language</i>
<i>back there, though.</i>

1:11:27.953 --> 1:11:31.759
<i>You know, I-I particularly</i>
<i>liked "prison bitch."</i>

1:11:41.467 --> 1:11:44.207
<i>Well, who's the bitch now?</i>

1:11:44.242 --> 1:11:46.173
<i>Oh, that wasn't</i>
<i>a rhetorical question.</i>

1:11:46.208 --> 1:11:51.076
<i>Hey! Who's the bitch now?</i>

1:11:51.112 --> 1:11:52.415
I'm the bitch.

1:11:58.385 --> 1:12:01.655
<i>No more games.</i>
<i>You can't win.</i>

1:12:03.059 --> 1:12:04.790
<i>Launch the fucking strike.</i>

1:12:20.804 --> 1:12:22.379
Do you want me
to take the shot?

1:12:53.036 --> 1:12:56.279
You want me to launch
this attack, it's ready.

1:12:56.314 --> 1:12:58.910
No, that is not him.
He's talking to somebody.

1:13:00.248 --> 1:13:01.544
But I want promises.

1:13:01.580 --> 1:13:03.849
I want promises this time.

1:13:04.817 --> 1:13:07.523
You deactivate the bomb,
and you set me free.

1:13:08.519 --> 1:13:10.086
<i> I promise.</i>

1:13:13.458 --> 1:13:14.392
Hail Mary time.

1:13:14.427 --> 1:13:15.792
<i> Officer Reed.</i>

1:13:15.827 --> 1:13:17.829
<i>I wouldn't recommend</i>
<i>doing that.</i>

1:13:17.864 --> 1:13:20.336
<i>Leave now before I turn you</i>
<i>into cat food,</i>

1:13:20.371 --> 1:13:22.472
<i>like your friends</i>
<i>on the fourth floor.</i>

1:13:28.110 --> 1:13:30.139
<i>You stay out.</i>

1:13:32.379 --> 1:13:33.846
Help me.

1:13:35.184 --> 1:13:37.212
<i>Finish the job, soldier!</i>

1:13:49.762 --> 1:13:52.601
Yellow light.
Waiting next cue.

1:14:00.405 --> 1:14:01.440
Green light.

1:14:01.475 --> 1:14:04.041
Roger that.
Green light.

1:14:12.686 --> 1:14:15.258
All units, all units,
stand down.

1:14:15.293 --> 1:14:17.225
Orlando is not the bomber.
I repeat,

1:14:17.260 --> 1:14:19.295
<i>Orlando is not the bomber.</i>

1:14:19.330 --> 1:14:20.689
Red light, red light!
Stand down!

1:14:20.725 --> 1:14:22.125
- Oh, God!

1:14:28.666 --> 1:14:30.100
Oh, God.

1:14:31.505 --> 1:14:34.104
That's a miss.
Thank God.

1:14:44.018 --> 1:14:47.989
He must have a live feed here
and into the rigged room.

1:14:48.025 --> 1:14:49.119
He's close by.

1:14:50.594 --> 1:14:53.158
We aren't making
any more heat signatures out.

1:14:53.194 --> 1:14:54.696
He's here.

1:14:54.731 --> 1:14:58.100
He saw me as I came in.
Read my name right off the tag.

1:14:58.136 --> 1:15:02.231
Plus, signals are jammed
all throughout around the city
after that DDoS attack.

1:15:02.266 --> 1:15:06.169
Only way to see in here,
right now, is to be here.

1:15:07.641 --> 1:15:09.011
<i>You see, soldier?</i>

1:15:09.047 --> 1:15:10.809
<i>I'm not the enemy.</i>

1:15:10.844 --> 1:15:13.308
<i>Everyone else</i>
<i>is trying to kill you.</i>

1:15:45.478 --> 1:15:46.814
It's finished.

1:15:48.051 --> 1:15:50.081
I broke it.

1:15:50.116 --> 1:15:52.487
<i>I never doubted you</i>
<i>for a second.</i>

1:15:52.522 --> 1:15:54.918
The last lock
is manually operated.

1:15:54.953 --> 1:15:58.156
Disarm all the bombs
and let me go.

1:15:58.192 --> 1:16:02.124
<i>Man, you are a beast hacker,</i>
<i>but you're gullible as shit.</i>

1:16:02.159 --> 1:16:04.226
<i>There's no fertilizer bomb</i>
<i>out there.</i>

1:16:04.261 --> 1:16:06.667
<i>There's not enough soil.</i>
<i>Where would I put it?</i>

1:16:06.702 --> 1:16:09.468
<i>Nah, there's only</i>
<i>one bomb left, Orlando,</i>

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:11.773
<i>and it's under you.</i>

1:16:12.539 --> 1:16:15.077
I did my job. Let me go.

1:16:15.113 --> 1:16:16.104
<i>I don't think so.</i>

1:16:16.140 --> 1:16:18.881
<i>I'll handle</i>
<i>the last lock myself.</i>

1:16:18.916 --> 1:16:20.012
Oh, no?

1:16:52.676 --> 1:16:54.816
Hey... Ava.

1:16:56.486 --> 1:16:58.516
That shield
wasn't just for him.

1:16:58.552 --> 1:16:59.920
It was for us, too.

1:17:00.951 --> 1:17:03.720
He can't see us
or hear us.

1:17:03.756 --> 1:17:05.992
Not unless I want him to.

1:17:07.124 --> 1:17:08.862
<i>Stay seated, Orlando.</i>

1:17:08.898 --> 1:17:11.129
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>when it's safe to get up.</i>

1:17:18.339 --> 1:17:19.806
Please help!

1:17:19.841 --> 1:17:23.174
He cut the cameras!
That psycho can't see.

1:17:25.446 --> 1:17:27.581
Okeydoke, miss.

1:17:27.617 --> 1:17:29.180
Get you out of here
in a jiffy.

1:17:38.125 --> 1:17:41.027
<i>Hang in there, Red Knight.</i>
<i>It's almost done.</i>

1:17:44.464 --> 1:17:45.933
Son of a...

1:17:47.538 --> 1:17:49.137
Okay, get the hell
out of here, go.

1:17:49.173 --> 1:17:49.932
- I-I--
- Run.

1:17:49.968 --> 1:17:52.439
- Ava, go!
- Ava, you're out.

1:17:52.474 --> 1:17:54.205
- Go!
- Help him.

1:17:56.412 --> 1:17:58.076
- Wallace.
- Orlando.

1:17:58.112 --> 1:17:59.814
- Yeah.
- Can you get me
out of this thing?

1:17:59.850 --> 1:18:02.378
- Why? You
in some kind of hurry?
- A little bit.

1:18:08.186 --> 1:18:10.457
- How much do you weigh?
- How much do I weigh?

1:18:10.492 --> 1:18:12.320
- Yeah.
- Uh, 175.

1:18:12.356 --> 1:18:16.024
One-seventy-five solid
or 177? 'Cause it matters.

1:18:16.059 --> 1:18:17.629
Last time I checked,
I was 175.

1:18:17.664 --> 1:18:19.329
What is it,
keto diet?

1:18:19.364 --> 1:18:21.369
Get me outta this thing,
I'll take you for ice cream.

1:18:21.404 --> 1:18:22.697
Yeah. Full-fat, okay?

1:18:54.931 --> 1:18:57.406
Ah, damnit. Damn!

1:18:57.442 --> 1:18:59.270
- What? What, what?
- Shit!

1:19:01.674 --> 1:19:02.872
I can't stop it.

1:19:02.908 --> 1:19:04.478
It's only rigged to explode.

1:19:04.513 --> 1:19:07.008
It's a pressure switch.

1:19:07.043 --> 1:19:08.818
Let's see what I can do.

1:19:16.052 --> 1:19:17.992
Ah, there's no way out.

1:19:21.363 --> 1:19:22.964
No way out.

1:19:46.020 --> 1:19:48.253
Hey, you hear me,
you son of a bitch?

1:19:49.557 --> 1:19:50.722
<i>We made a deal.</i>

1:19:50.758 --> 1:19:53.995
I help you, you let me go.

1:19:55.396 --> 1:19:56.432
<i>I lied.</i>

1:20:21.326 --> 1:20:23.354
You motherfucking...

1:20:25.928 --> 1:20:28.194
<i>You shouldn't</i>
<i>have done that, asshole.</i>

1:20:32.871 --> 1:20:35.432
- Tell my family
I love them, okay?
- Yeah.

1:20:35.468 --> 1:20:38.572
- I know what we're gonna do.
- What are you thinkin'?

1:20:38.607 --> 1:20:39.909
Get out of here safe.

1:20:40.672 --> 1:20:41.911
Go.

1:20:42.674 --> 1:20:44.644
Run! Go!

1:20:56.424 --> 1:20:57.954
Status!

1:20:57.990 --> 1:20:59.929
Give me a fucking status!

1:21:12.410 --> 1:21:13.573
You son of a bitch!

1:21:13.608 --> 1:21:15.340
Yeah! He's alive!

1:21:17.877 --> 1:21:19.611
You clever motherfucker.

1:21:24.216 --> 1:21:27.957
- Dad's okay?
- Yes, Dad is fine.

1:21:33.161 --> 1:21:35.597
Look, I'll answer questions
later, all right?

1:21:35.632 --> 1:21:37.698
I just wanna see my family.

1:21:37.734 --> 1:21:39.298
Is this the man
in the elevator?

1:21:41.197 --> 1:21:43.467
Yeah, that's my co-worker.

1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:45.942
And my friend.

1:21:46.707 --> 1:21:48.938
He was a good man.

1:21:48.974 --> 1:21:50.705
And I got him killed.

1:21:55.579 --> 1:21:58.152
- We can see Dad now, right?
- Yes, sweetie.

1:21:58.188 --> 1:22:02.052
- He's not in trouble, is he?
- No, I don't think so.

1:22:02.087 --> 1:22:04.226
- Mrs. Friar.
- Yes.

1:22:04.261 --> 1:22:06.622
Come with me, please,
I'm gonna take you
to see your husband.

1:22:28.453 --> 1:22:30.917
"Charlie don't surf."

1:22:30.953 --> 1:22:32.214
Charlie--
Where is that from again?

1:22:32.250 --> 1:22:34.048
<i>Apocalypse Now.</i>
Trippy movie.

1:22:34.083 --> 1:22:37.393
The guy
in the picture was wearing
an<i> Apocalypse Now</i> shirt.

1:22:37.428 --> 1:22:39.289
<i>Apocalypse Now.</i>

1:22:39.324 --> 1:22:41.490
<i>You like movies, Orlando?</i>

1:22:41.525 --> 1:22:44.095
I don't give a shit
about movies right now.

1:22:44.130 --> 1:22:46.195
<i>I really like</i>
Apocalypse Now.

1:22:46.231 --> 1:22:48.497
Is this the man
in the elevator?

1:22:48.533 --> 1:22:51.070
It was a construction gig fall
when I was 17.

1:22:51.105 --> 1:22:52.868
Pops never quite
got over that one.

1:22:52.903 --> 1:22:55.774
His army brat gimp
not being able
to follow in his footsteps.

1:22:55.810 --> 1:22:57.409
Oh, a parent's love.

1:23:05.448 --> 1:23:07.021
<i> "Charlie don't surf."</i>

1:23:07.057 --> 1:23:10.191
My desk is in the blind spot
in this office.

1:23:11.593 --> 1:23:12.688
It's him.

1:23:24.035 --> 1:23:25.338
What the hell?

1:23:44.757 --> 1:23:45.721
Ava.

1:23:48.496 --> 1:23:52.198
Where did you work
in this building?
Is it Templar Bonds?

1:23:52.233 --> 1:23:55.365
No, I-I work
in the management
office. Why?

1:23:55.401 --> 1:23:58.701
- So you have security access?
- Yeah.

1:23:59.973 --> 1:24:01.508
Yeah, the hot blonde?

1:24:01.543 --> 1:24:03.772
No, no, no.
Keep up, that's Ava.
That's the seventh floor.

1:24:07.947 --> 1:24:09.613
What's going on?

1:24:12.448 --> 1:24:14.420
Is that standard
in elevators?

1:24:15.591 --> 1:24:16.785
I don't know.

1:24:49.990 --> 1:24:51.721
Hey, I think I know you.

1:24:53.961 --> 1:24:56.127
Yeah, I remember you.

1:24:56.163 --> 1:24:57.966
What are you
talking about, baby?

1:24:58.002 --> 1:25:00.229
Oh, just that one idiot
from Dad's office.

1:25:00.265 --> 1:25:02.270
You're Dad's
friend, right?

1:25:03.532 --> 1:25:06.575
Yes. Your dad
and I are...

1:25:06.610 --> 1:25:08.210
We're very close.

1:25:08.977 --> 1:25:10.707
I thought that you...

1:25:13.617 --> 1:25:15.180
What's wrong, Mom?

1:25:15.215 --> 1:25:17.549
Nothing, just...
something I knew.

1:25:19.150 --> 1:25:20.482
You know what?

1:25:20.518 --> 1:25:22.590
I was gonna save this
for later,

1:25:22.626 --> 1:25:26.057
but... why not?

1:25:26.093 --> 1:25:28.057
It's your birthday, right?

1:25:29.162 --> 1:25:31.200
- Got a present for you.
- Oh.

1:25:37.036 --> 1:25:39.038
Hey, somebody!

1:25:39.074 --> 1:25:42.470
Please, help me
find my family.

1:25:42.505 --> 1:25:44.479
I need to find my daughter.

1:25:44.514 --> 1:25:45.873
Anyone?

1:25:45.909 --> 1:25:48.080
Hey, your daughter,
was she wearing
a pink jacket?

1:25:48.115 --> 1:25:51.083
- Yeah, where'd you see her?
- An officer took her
and another person up there.

1:25:51.118 --> 1:25:54.155
- That elevator.
- Oh, my God.

1:25:54.190 --> 1:25:56.357
- They're going to the roof.
- Let's look.

1:26:00.093 --> 1:26:01.791
Let's go! Walk!

1:26:03.767 --> 1:26:06.235
Walk!
To your left.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:08.402
Good. Okay, stop.

1:26:14.107 --> 1:26:15.537
No, please!

1:26:15.573 --> 1:26:18.544
Shut up! Get over there.
Over there.

1:26:19.812 --> 1:26:23.144
Now, you just think of this
as a little fireworks jacket.

1:26:23.179 --> 1:26:24.383
Okay?

1:26:24.418 --> 1:26:26.587
The whole city's gonna
celebrate your birthday!

1:26:26.623 --> 1:26:27.652
Let's go.

1:26:56.116 --> 1:26:58.284
More collateral damage!

1:26:58.320 --> 1:27:01.455
How many gotta die for you,
Orlando?!

1:27:03.120 --> 1:27:04.757
Whoo!

1:27:08.462 --> 1:27:11.465
So we finally reach
the end of the river.

1:27:13.331 --> 1:27:17.303
Willard came all this way
to eliminate Colonel Kurtz
with extreme prejudice,

1:27:17.338 --> 1:27:20.669
only to find out...
when they met...

1:27:20.704 --> 1:27:23.411
...they were the same man.

1:27:25.943 --> 1:27:29.450
Come on out, Orlando!
Face your commanding officer!

1:27:33.316 --> 1:27:35.621
Okay. Okay.

1:27:36.386 --> 1:27:37.590
I'm coming out.

1:27:38.795 --> 1:27:40.725
Here comes Daddy.

1:27:50.970 --> 1:27:52.308
Stop!

1:27:55.771 --> 1:27:58.908
Orlando, please
fix this. Please!

1:28:00.311 --> 1:28:02.785
You fucked up.

1:28:02.820 --> 1:28:04.315
I had a well-planned,

1:28:04.351 --> 1:28:06.817
well-executed operation,
soldier.

1:28:08.958 --> 1:28:11.822
Tracking, surveillance,

1:28:11.858 --> 1:28:15.129
listening to your droning
bullshit every fucking day.

1:28:15.165 --> 1:28:16.860
God-- is he
that boring at home?

1:28:20.133 --> 1:28:21.766
I was so close.

1:28:22.965 --> 1:28:25.968
Do you have any idea
what I put into this?!

1:28:27.310 --> 1:28:30.543
How long it took
to build that chair rig?!

1:28:30.579 --> 1:28:32.614
Yeah, where'd you learn that?
On Staten Island?

1:28:32.649 --> 1:28:34.711
Well...

1:28:34.747 --> 1:28:37.785
you learn a thing or two
when your old man was...

1:28:37.821 --> 1:28:39.888
Delta in 'Nam.

1:28:39.924 --> 1:28:42.050
Your whole life is a lie.

1:28:43.619 --> 1:28:45.320
You good, honey?

1:28:49.631 --> 1:28:54.532
You may not have put the bullet
in my dad's head,

1:28:54.568 --> 1:28:56.966
but you fucking took him
out of commission!

1:28:59.570 --> 1:29:01.072
He and my mom--
Look at me!

1:29:01.107 --> 1:29:02.411
Okay, okay.

1:29:03.910 --> 1:29:07.044
They sunk every penny they had
into that sham company of yours.

1:29:07.080 --> 1:29:08.450
You lied.

1:29:08.485 --> 1:29:11.378
You might as well have pulled
the trigger yourself.

1:29:11.414 --> 1:29:13.250
Orlando...

1:29:13.286 --> 1:29:14.823
I need you to know--

1:29:14.858 --> 1:29:17.052
you deserve this.

1:29:18.457 --> 1:29:20.627
So this is all about your dad?

1:29:22.728 --> 1:29:25.401
I mean, yes and no.
I did need your skills.

1:29:26.435 --> 1:29:27.761
Killing you, you know,
that was just a...

1:29:27.797 --> 1:29:29.900
...little perk.

1:29:34.407 --> 1:29:37.072
This is my sin, not theirs.

1:29:38.312 --> 1:29:40.314
The sins of the father...

1:29:40.349 --> 1:29:42.746
- Hey, let 'em go.
- Dad, I'm scared!

1:29:42.781 --> 1:29:46.114
Take me. I can help you.
I can help you vanish.

1:29:54.762 --> 1:29:59.000
Nah, I think
this just became
a suicide mission.

1:29:59.035 --> 1:30:01.566
Dad, I wanna go home.

1:30:01.602 --> 1:30:04.099
- We will, honey.
- Quit lying to her.

1:30:04.135 --> 1:30:07.000
Quit lying to your daughter!
That's what got you here!

1:30:07.036 --> 1:30:10.779
Your deceit, your lies!
You fucking snake!

1:30:10.814 --> 1:30:12.107
Stop lying!

1:30:13.514 --> 1:30:15.044
You know what, Enzo?
You're right.

1:30:16.513 --> 1:30:17.882
I enjoyed it.

1:30:20.683 --> 1:30:22.590
I enjoyed the rush.

1:30:23.960 --> 1:30:25.692
I was good at it.

1:30:26.556 --> 1:30:28.557
I am good at it.

1:30:28.592 --> 1:30:30.299
And I would do it again.

1:30:30.334 --> 1:30:32.527
Especially to a sucker
like your old man.

1:30:32.562 --> 1:30:34.934
Shut the fuck up!

1:30:45.146 --> 1:30:46.215
Honey, you okay?

1:30:46.250 --> 1:30:47.648
- You all right?

1:30:47.683 --> 1:30:49.911
Okay, okay. Okay, let's get
this thing off of you.

1:30:49.946 --> 1:30:51.379
- All right?
- Orlando, get it off.

1:31:00.690 --> 1:31:01.863
- Dad...

1:31:01.899 --> 1:31:03.891
Hang on, relax.

1:31:03.927 --> 1:31:06.601
- It's counting down.
- Oh, no.

1:31:09.103 --> 1:31:11.771
Help! Help!

1:31:14.375 --> 1:31:15.871
What are you gonna do?

1:31:15.906 --> 1:31:19.240
What are you
gonna do, Orlando?

1:31:20.446 --> 1:31:22.683
Blame yourself again?

1:31:26.482 --> 1:31:27.886
Run.

1:31:27.922 --> 1:31:31.960
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying here. Go, Kim. Go!

1:31:31.995 --> 1:31:32.721
- No.
- Go!

1:31:32.756 --> 1:31:34.794
- No.
- Run...

1:31:46.272 --> 1:31:47.503
Checkmate.

1:31:47.538 --> 1:31:49.705
Thank you!

1:31:49.741 --> 1:31:51.978
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:32:03.559 --> 1:32:05.859
Yeah, I'm on my way.
See you at the hospital.

1:32:05.895 --> 1:32:09.262
- Yeah, a vacation sounds nice.

1:32:09.298 --> 1:32:11.325
Retirement sounds better.

1:32:16.070 --> 1:32:17.105
Yep.

1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:19.903
Thanks for helping out.

1:32:19.938 --> 1:32:23.003
Yeah, I'm just a guy
trying to fix his family.

1:32:23.038 --> 1:32:26.681
That guy over there,
he's the hero.

1:32:28.579 --> 1:32:30.614
He saved us all.

1:32:30.649 --> 1:32:32.081
Tell that to the papers,
okay?

1:32:32.116 --> 1:32:34.920
We're gonna need you
downtown for questioning.

1:32:36.426 --> 1:32:38.321
Can I just have a minute
with my family?

1:32:38.356 --> 1:32:39.958
Yeah.

1:32:45.997 --> 1:32:48.934
You guys still mad at me
for missing the party?

1:32:51.441 --> 1:32:53.372
I'm here to make it
up to you, okay?
