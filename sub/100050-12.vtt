00:07.398 --> 00:09.052
Previously onYoung Sheldon...

00:09.096 --> 00:10.401
Who are you?I'm Paige.

00:10.445 --> 00:13.100
A unique child can require
a lot of attention.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.579
Try all the attention.

00:14.623 --> 00:16.886
Barry and I haven't been
in a good place in a long time.

00:16.929 --> 00:20.063
This is oddly reminiscent
of a dinner with my family.

00:20.107 --> 00:22.631
Do you think Stone Age parents
stayed together forever?

00:22.674 --> 00:24.807
They had to. There
were no lawyers.

00:24.850 --> 00:27.505
Well, I think my parents
are getting a divorce.Why?

00:27.549 --> 00:28.506
They fight
all the time.

00:28.550 --> 00:31.074
About what?Mostly me.

00:31.118 --> 00:32.510
I guess I'm lucky.

00:32.554 --> 00:33.772
Why?

00:33.816 --> 00:36.514
I'm the glue that holds
our family together.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.738
No more coffee?

00:42.781 --> 00:43.782
Last cup.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.132
Well, you mind making more?

00:45.175 --> 00:46.742
I just sat down.

00:46.785 --> 00:48.570
But you finished the pot.

00:48.613 --> 00:50.615
George, if I wanted
to make a cup of coffee,

00:50.659 --> 00:52.008
I'd have stayed at my house.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.663
Mmm.

00:54.706 --> 00:56.621
One day I'm gonna put you
in a home,

00:56.665 --> 00:58.580
and I'm gonna smile
just like that.

00:58.623 --> 00:59.798
That's fine.

00:59.842 --> 01:01.539
By then I won't know
who you are anyway.

01:02.627 --> 01:05.195
Guess who is getting a divorce.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.632
About time. Congrats.

01:07.676 --> 01:10.418
Linda and Barry Swanson.

01:10.461 --> 01:12.463
Who's that? A-And can you
tell me how to make coffee?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.813
They're Paige's parents.

01:14.857 --> 01:15.553
Who?

01:15.597 --> 01:17.033
The little smart girl.

01:17.077 --> 01:20.471
Apparently she's taking
the divorce really hard.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.865
I guess she's been having
trouble in school.

01:22.908 --> 01:24.475
Aw, poor thing.

01:24.519 --> 01:26.782
Linda thinks Sheldon
might be a good influence,

01:26.825 --> 01:29.089
you know, maybe rub off
on her a little bit.

01:29.132 --> 01:32.614
What, she wants her kid
to be more like Sheldon?

01:32.657 --> 01:35.051
I don't know what
to say about that.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.706
So, good news.

01:37.749 --> 01:40.578
Paige is gonna
spend the weekend with us.

01:40.622 --> 01:41.840
ADULT SHELDON:
My history with Paige

01:41.884 --> 01:44.321
brought up
complicated feelings.

01:44.365 --> 01:45.496
She challenged me.

01:45.540 --> 01:46.715
Do you know if you'll be doing

01:46.758 --> 01:47.890
a full-color octet calculation

01:47.933 --> 01:49.674
with matrix manipulations?

01:49.718 --> 01:51.720
I know you're in my spot.

01:51.763 --> 01:52.808
ADULT SHELDON:
She disturbed me.

01:52.851 --> 01:54.897
Hi, Sheldon!

01:54.940 --> 01:56.464
ADULT SHELDON:
She enraged me.

01:56.507 --> 01:57.552
Checkmate.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.163
ADULT SHELDON:
Things were simpler

02:00.207 --> 02:01.556
for my simple-minded sister.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.557

SHELDON:
The Professor Proton
Science Kit!

02:31.586 --> 02:33.631
Wait a minute.

02:33.675 --> 02:35.764
Last time you gave me a present
for no reason,

02:35.807 --> 02:37.461
I had to get a booster shot.

02:37.505 --> 02:38.897
Nothing like that.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.683
I was just thinking,
it might be a fun thing for you

02:41.726 --> 02:43.075
to share with Paige.

02:43.119 --> 02:46.427
Sharing. Sometimes I feel
like you don't know me.

02:46.470 --> 02:49.212
Paige is having a rough time
at home right now,

02:49.256 --> 02:51.562
and I think she could really
use a friend.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.303
A crocodile could really
use a meal,

02:53.347 --> 02:55.653
but that doesn't mean
I should leap into his mouth.

02:55.697 --> 02:59.657
Shelly, I am asking you
to do this for me.

02:59.701 --> 03:01.224
ADULT SHELDON:
This was the woman

03:01.268 --> 03:04.009
who cut the crusts off
my sandwiches.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.795
She had me. Into the mouth I go.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.715

03:13.758 --> 03:15.586
Why haven't you mowed the lawn?

03:15.630 --> 03:16.805
I been busy.

03:16.848 --> 03:18.676
Well, you're not busy now.

03:18.720 --> 03:19.851
I'm working out.

03:19.895 --> 03:22.332
Got the word "work"
right there in it.

03:24.508 --> 03:26.293
Get out there and mow.

03:26.336 --> 03:28.251
Why? I'm making good money.

03:28.295 --> 03:30.819
I don't need an allowance,
so I don't need to do chores.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.386
It's not about that.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.301
You're part of this family,
you still need to help out.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.780
So I'm just here
to do your bidding?

03:35.824 --> 03:38.653
Well, and people say
Sheldon's a genius.

03:43.571 --> 03:46.356
I just want to remind you both
to please be sensitive

03:46.400 --> 03:49.229
about the situation
with Paige's family.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.621
She's talking to
you, dingus.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.188
Both of you.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.191
Hi, come in.Hello.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.714
Hi, Missy.
Hi, Sheldon.

03:56.758 --> 03:58.934
What did you do to your hair?
Is this because

03:58.977 --> 04:00.283
your parents got divorced?

04:00.327 --> 04:01.719
Dingus.

04:01.763 --> 04:03.155
LINDA:
Well, she just
really wanted to,

04:03.199 --> 04:04.940
and I thought, you know,
under the circumstances,

04:04.983 --> 04:05.941
why not?

04:05.984 --> 04:07.638
Well, I think it looks great.

04:07.682 --> 04:08.639
So, can I have pink...?

04:08.683 --> 04:11.120
No. Why don't you kids go play?

04:11.163 --> 04:13.253
I'd rather have pink hair
than together parents.

04:13.296 --> 04:14.602
PAIGE:
I don't blame you.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.564
Well, it's about time.

04:23.741 --> 04:25.830
Hi, Mr. Cooper!

04:25.874 --> 04:29.269
Billy.
What are you doing?

04:29.312 --> 04:30.748
I'm mowing the lawn.

04:30.792 --> 04:31.793
What are youdoing?

04:31.836 --> 04:33.490
Did Georgie put
you up to this?

04:33.534 --> 04:34.622
Yeah. He's paying me.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.493
That dummy.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.713
I'm raising the money
to buy a Jet Ski.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.804
I mean, I'm thrilled
that he's gone,

04:42.847 --> 04:44.632
but I do worry about
how it's affecting Paige.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.068
Of course.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.244
You and George have
such a beautiful family.

04:48.288 --> 04:50.855
I think it's good for her
to be around that right now.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.598
Oh. Hey.

04:54.642 --> 04:57.384
Nice to see you.
Sorry about the divorce.

04:57.427 --> 04:59.995
I got to go yell
at my idiot son.

05:00.038 --> 05:01.518
Georgie!
Where are you?

05:03.955 --> 05:05.479
You look great,
by the way.

05:05.522 --> 05:08.133
Oh, thanks.
I started smoking again.

05:11.093 --> 05:12.964
What the hell's
wrong with you?

05:13.008 --> 05:14.488
You think it's okay
for Billy Sparks

05:14.531 --> 05:15.880
to do yourwork?

05:15.924 --> 05:17.360
I paid him.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.580
I tried to give him two dollars,
but he only wanted one.

05:19.623 --> 05:22.322
Damn it, Georgie, I'm trying
to teach you responsibility.

05:22.365 --> 05:25.281
You can't just buy your way
out of everything in life.You sure?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.892
'Cause I'll give you ten bucks
to leave me alone right now.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.329
Go mow the lawn.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.069
I'm not gonna
say it again.

05:31.113 --> 05:34.725
Fine. But I'm only doing this
so you'll get off my back.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.988
Oh, you'll know when I'm
on your back, little man.

05:38.555 --> 05:40.731
Now we can be hair twins.

05:40.775 --> 05:42.907
Paige, you're supposed to be
doing science with me.

05:42.951 --> 05:44.518
That's boring.

05:44.561 --> 05:46.737
I want to do
something dangerous.

05:46.781 --> 05:49.218
This isdangerous. We don't have
an eye wash station.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.438
Let's go to the mall.Mom doesn't like the mall.

05:51.481 --> 05:53.831
She says the mannequins
don't have enough clothes on,

05:53.875 --> 05:56.007
but I think
it's 'cause we're poor.

05:56.051 --> 05:58.749
We are poor.
I do our taxes.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.534
Don't worry.
I'll ask her.

06:00.577 --> 06:02.100
Ever since my
parents got divorced,

06:02.144 --> 06:03.754
people can't
say no to me.

06:03.798 --> 06:05.887
My mom promised she would
take me to the mall to get me

06:05.930 --> 06:07.889
a new backpack,
but she was so busy

06:07.932 --> 06:09.630
cleaning my dad's stuff
out of the garage

06:09.673 --> 06:11.545
that I think
she forgot.Oh.

06:11.588 --> 06:14.852
Of course I can take you.
Anything you need.

06:14.896 --> 06:16.985
Thank you,
Mrs. Cooper.

06:20.641 --> 06:22.860
Will you marry me?

06:29.867 --> 06:31.652
Why are you taking
a backpack to the mall?

06:31.695 --> 06:33.436
This is my mall
safety kit.

06:35.307 --> 06:37.135
Earplugs to drown out
crowd noise,

06:37.179 --> 06:39.311
Wet-Naps to wipe down
escalator handrails,

06:39.355 --> 06:41.139
a compass, a map of the mall,

06:41.183 --> 06:42.880
and a whistle,
in case I get lost

06:42.924 --> 06:45.361
or approached by a woman
holding a perfume bottle.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.363
You want to stuff him
in there, right?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.756
No.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.369
Okay, Paige,

06:53.413 --> 06:55.676
where should we go
to get your backpack?

06:55.719 --> 06:58.766
The Hello Kitty store.I would help you find it,
but this subpar mall map

06:58.809 --> 07:00.681
isn't even
oriented north.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.945
Let's go.All right, have fun
at the Hello Kitty store,

07:03.988 --> 07:06.382
and meet me at the
fountain in half an hour.

07:06.426 --> 07:09.559
Just to be clear, there are
no actual kitties, right?

07:10.821 --> 07:12.780
I can't imagine
talking to my dad

07:12.823 --> 07:14.259
the way this kid
talks to me.

07:14.303 --> 07:17.349
I'd have had a belt
on my backside so fast...

07:17.393 --> 07:19.526
My dad was a hugger.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.963
I had to tell him three times
to mow the lawn,

07:22.006 --> 07:23.312
and he still gave me attitude.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.446
He's going to school,
holding down a job.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.449
If he was my kid,
I'd be proud of him.

07:31.407 --> 07:33.844
I am proud of him.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.803
When he's not being
a total pain in my ass.

07:37.326 --> 07:39.894
You ever tell him you're proud?

07:39.937 --> 07:41.286
He knows.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.159
I think it's important
for children to hear it.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.422
You don't even have kids.

07:46.466 --> 07:48.424
I teach and coach teenage boys.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.296
I also put up with
your childish nonsense.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.518
Georgie's just being
so damn disrespectful,

07:55.562 --> 07:56.824
I don't want to reward that.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.303
All right.

07:58.347 --> 08:00.436
My father never said
he was proud of me.

08:00.480 --> 08:01.916
I turned out just fine.

08:01.959 --> 08:06.573
George, I'm just trying
to have a nice day,

08:06.616 --> 08:08.313
make some white folks
uncomfortable.

What's the topic, devil worship?Hey,

08:22.719 --> 08:24.286
did you know there's
a bow tie section in the back?

08:24.329 --> 08:28.116
Why would they hide
that in the back?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.599
Ooh.What's that?

08:32.642 --> 08:34.426
Body glitter.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.820
That's so much better
than regular glitter.

08:36.864 --> 08:37.821
Then buy it.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.693
I don't have
any money.

08:39.736 --> 08:40.955
Then steal it.

08:40.998 --> 08:43.174
No, my mom
would kill me.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.440
Fine. Your mom
can't punish me.

any bow ties,

08:49.746 --> 08:51.400
just a shirt with
a bad word on it.

08:51.443 --> 08:53.184
What did you put
in your pocket?

08:53.228 --> 08:54.577
Nothing.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.405
Are you guys stealing?
Because if you are,

08:56.448 --> 08:59.234
I am prepared to literally
blow the whistle on you...Okay.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.541
Okay.

09:01.584 --> 09:04.239
Relax, we were just
playing around.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.284
Let's just get
out of here.Good.

09:06.328 --> 09:07.372
Everyone behind the counter

09:07.416 --> 09:08.852
has an earring
where an earring

09:08.896 --> 09:10.506
does not belong.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.334

looks like you're turning

09:12.377 --> 09:14.945

Hey.

09:15.990 --> 09:17.382
I've already mowed the lawn.

09:17.426 --> 09:19.428
I know.
Thanks for doing that.

09:19.471 --> 09:21.952
So what do you want?

09:21.996 --> 09:24.651
Well, I was thinking you and I
could go grab a burger.

09:24.694 --> 09:26.478
Why?

09:26.522 --> 09:28.437
'Cause I thought
it'd be a nice thing to do.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.091
Which restaurant?

09:30.134 --> 09:31.962
Why does it matter?

09:32.006 --> 09:33.311
Well, McDonald's burgers
are fried,

09:33.355 --> 09:34.878
and sometimes
I like flame-broiled.

09:34.922 --> 09:37.533
Fine, we can go to Burger King.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.361
I don't like the fries
at Burger King.

09:39.404 --> 09:40.710
Ooh, Arby's has

09:40.754 --> 09:42.146
those curly fries.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.322
Shoot, they don't have burgers.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.847
Then let's go to Whataburger.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.632
Okay, but I hope you're not
this cranky the whole meal.

09:56.639 --> 09:58.467
So,

09:58.510 --> 10:00.730
we haven't really had
a chance to talk much lately.

10:00.774 --> 10:02.340
Why is it so hot in here?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.125
AC's busted.

10:04.168 --> 10:05.648
Why don't you get it fixed?

10:05.692 --> 10:07.998
'Cause I got better things
to spend my money on.

10:09.043 --> 10:10.566
Anyway,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.046
what I wanted to say

10:12.089 --> 10:16.485
is, even though I'm not loving
your attitude lately,

10:16.528 --> 10:18.269
I think it's great
you got this job

10:18.313 --> 10:20.532
and y-you're doing
so well at it.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.014
I'm proud of you.

10:24.058 --> 10:25.799
All right.

10:25.842 --> 10:27.757
That's all you have to say?

10:27.801 --> 10:30.368
Well, maybe if I wasn't
sweating my balls off,

10:30.412 --> 10:31.935
I could think of something else.

10:31.979 --> 10:33.589
Just stick your head
out the window.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.113
If it's about money,
I've got money.

10:38.159 --> 10:40.770
It can even be a loan
if it makes you feel better.

10:42.467 --> 10:44.469
Don't you dare.

10:47.734 --> 10:50.475
You said you're proud of my job.
I don't think you are.

10:50.519 --> 10:52.042
You know what? Forget lunch.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.478
Let's just go home.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.829
Smart. Save some money
for your truck.

10:56.873 --> 10:58.396
That's it.

10:58.440 --> 11:00.398
You're walking.

11:08.624 --> 11:12.323
ADULT SHELDON:
I had survived a perilous trip
to the accessory store,

11:12.367 --> 11:16.632
but it turned out,
the real accessory was me.

11:22.159 --> 11:23.639
I can't believe you stole.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.728
You walked out with it.
You stole.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.034
Why would I steal glitter?

11:27.077 --> 11:29.166
I already have
a sparkling personality.

11:29.210 --> 11:30.646
Tell it to the cops.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.908
Or your cellmate.

11:31.952 --> 11:35.129
You're so smart.
Why are you acting like this?

11:35.172 --> 11:37.044
Maybe I don't want to be smart.

11:37.087 --> 11:39.481
I have to sit down.

11:39.524 --> 11:41.483
Being smart sucks.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.877
It's the reason
we moved here from Arkansas,

11:43.920 --> 11:47.707
a-and my parents never yelled
at each other before that.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.014
It's just better to be normal.

11:51.058 --> 11:54.539
It works for me. But I
also have good cheekbones.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.026
You swim here?

12:03.070 --> 12:06.726
Dad kicked me out of his truck.
I had to walk back.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.380
What dumb thing
did you say or do?

12:09.424 --> 12:11.731
How do you know I'm the one
who did something dumb?

12:11.774 --> 12:13.994
'Cause you kind of shine at it.

12:14.037 --> 12:16.779
All I did is offer
to pay to fix his AC.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.129
And there it is. Dumb.

12:19.173 --> 12:20.261
What's wrong with that?

12:20.304 --> 12:21.697
Your dad is a grown man.

12:21.741 --> 12:25.092
He doesn't want his kid
giving him money.

12:25.135 --> 12:27.050
So he's glad I'm making money,

12:27.094 --> 12:29.836
but I'm not allowed to use
that money to help him out?

12:29.879 --> 12:31.751
I don't get it.Well, someday,
when you have

12:31.794 --> 12:35.363
a bunch of sweaty, mullet-headed
kids running around, you will.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.278
Oh, I ain't never having kids.

12:37.321 --> 12:40.716
Well, that's the smartest thing
I ever heard you say.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
Thank you.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.076
STURGIS :
John Sturgis at your service.

12:53.120 --> 12:54.774
Dr. Sturgis, Sheldon Cooper.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.166
Hello, Sheldon.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.211
How are you doing?

12:57.254 --> 12:59.517
Confused, upset, annoyed,

12:59.561 --> 13:01.868
and potentially
in trouble with the law.

13:01.911 --> 13:05.262
Well, in which order would
you like to handle this?

13:05.306 --> 13:06.829
Let's start with confused,

13:06.873 --> 13:08.962
but if we hear sirens
approaching, we'll jump ahead.

13:09.005 --> 13:11.181
Great. What's on your mind?

13:11.225 --> 13:13.793
Do you ever wish
that you weren't smart?

13:13.836 --> 13:16.839
So I would be short,
lonely andstupid?

13:16.883 --> 13:18.667
No, that seems worse.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.016
Why do you ask?

13:20.060 --> 13:21.844
Do you remember Paige?

13:21.888 --> 13:23.846
Of course,
brilliant little girl.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.152
I know, but she says
that she doesn't

13:25.195 --> 13:27.110
want to be smart anymore.

13:27.154 --> 13:31.375
Well, perhaps she's experiencing
some sort of identity crisis.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.030
Is it possible her ex
is dating someone

13:34.074 --> 13:38.121
who seems better for her
in every imaginable way?

13:38.165 --> 13:40.036
I'm confused.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.690
So am I.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.824
How do I make her understand
that being smart is the best?

13:44.867 --> 13:50.003
Might I suggest, instead
of trying to fix her problem,

13:50.046 --> 13:52.222
you just listen?

13:52.266 --> 13:55.138
When I was in the psychiatric
ward, I learned that people

13:55.182 --> 14:00.143
who are struggling emotionally
often just need to be heard.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.145
Hmm.

14:02.189 --> 14:05.018
Sounds difficult,
but I suppose I could try.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.672
Another thing I learned in
the hospital is that some people

14:07.716 --> 14:10.893
believe there are weird mole men
living in tunnels

14:10.937 --> 14:13.243
deep inside the earth.

14:13.287 --> 14:15.942
Well, this has been
mostly helpful.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.944
And you're mostly welcome.

14:24.385 --> 14:25.603
You made it.

14:25.647 --> 14:27.649
Yeah, I made it.

14:33.655 --> 14:35.657
Sorry.

14:37.572 --> 14:39.574
No problem.

14:45.797 --> 14:47.364
Ow.

14:47.408 --> 14:51.151
Ow. Is there a way to do this
so it doesn't hurt?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.153
No. Beauty is pain.

14:53.196 --> 14:55.764
Boy George must really suffer.

14:55.807 --> 14:57.157
Missy, I need a moment
with Paige.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.072
Make it quick.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.117
I'm only half-beautiful.

15:05.078 --> 15:06.079
Yeah?

15:06.122 --> 15:07.776
I'm listening.

15:07.819 --> 15:08.777
To what?

15:08.820 --> 15:09.996
To you.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.519
I'm not saying anything.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.216
Well, if you wanted to say
anything, I'd be listening.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.784
But I don't want
to say anything.

15:15.827 --> 15:18.221
And I don't want to be
listening, but here we are.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.570
Are you feeling better yet?

15:19.614 --> 15:24.053
You're being weird,
and not in the usual way.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.101
Guess that's my life now.

15:28.144 --> 15:29.537
What do you mean?

15:31.582 --> 15:34.237
Everyone is acting weird.

15:34.281 --> 15:39.242
My mom is going on dates and
my dad is acting like a child.

15:39.286 --> 15:42.985
My sister's crying all the time.

15:44.030 --> 15:45.770
I just

15:45.814 --> 15:51.124
wish that everything could
go back to the way it was.

15:51.167 --> 15:54.997
I don't think it will.

15:55.041 --> 15:57.565
ADULT SHELDON:
It turned out I was
really good at listening.

15:57.608 --> 16:01.264
The trick is to sit there, and
when you want to leave, don't.

16:02.309 --> 16:05.834
I have to live
in two separate houses.

16:05.877 --> 16:10.752
And my grandma says the meanest
things about my dad.

16:10.795 --> 16:13.233
I know that everyone is upset

16:13.276 --> 16:15.191
that I'm not doing well
in school.

16:15.235 --> 16:19.282
It's just hard to care.

16:21.328 --> 16:24.331
Everything that used
to seem important to me

16:24.374 --> 16:28.813
just... doesn't anymore.

16:31.033 --> 16:35.820
So I guess, really,
I just feel alone.

16:39.999 --> 16:41.957
That sounds hard.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.395
Yeah... it is.

16:45.439 --> 16:47.397
ADULT SHELDON:
Dr. Sturgis was right.

16:47.441 --> 16:51.880
There was nothing I could do
to fix this, or so I thought.

16:51.923 --> 16:54.100
Can I offer you a hot beverage?

16:55.144 --> 16:56.928
That would be nice.

16:56.972 --> 16:59.061
Be right back.

17:00.671 --> 17:02.412
ADULT SHELDON:
The "Hot Beverage of Comfort"

17:02.456 --> 17:04.066
would become my go-to method

17:04.110 --> 17:06.938
of dealing with someone
in emotional distress.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.766
And it always worked.

17:08.810 --> 17:11.117
Except when my wife
was in labor,

17:11.160 --> 17:14.163
where it was suggested
I throw it in my own face.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.954
What you doing?Paige is feeling sad,

17:22.998 --> 17:25.261
so I'm making her
a hot beverage.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.307
Oh. You're a good kid.

17:29.961 --> 17:31.963
I'm proud of you.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.923
Thank you.

17:34.966 --> 17:36.359
ADULT SHELDON:
Of all my accomplishments,

17:36.403 --> 17:39.145
I don't know why he singled
this moment out,

17:39.188 --> 17:42.017
but I'm glad he did.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.584
Sup?

17:43.627 --> 17:47.979

17:48.023 --> 17:50.982
