00:10.000 --> 00:12.116
-Good morning.
-Morning.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.395
Charlie, right?

00:13.560 --> 00:16.836
Well, l guess it's too late to deny it.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.718
Would you like some coffee?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.432
Sure. . .

00:23.000 --> 00:24.069
. . .l would.

00:26.120 --> 00:28.156
You have a beautiful house.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.830
Thank you. . .

00:34.880 --> 00:36.393
. . .so much.

00:37.440 --> 00:38.509
My name's Sandy.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.828
Yes, of course it is.

00:43.120 --> 00:48.797
How could l forget?
Sandy like the beach, or the Koufax.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.712
-Pardon me?
-You know, Sandy Koufax.

00:51.880 --> 00:54.314
Great Dodger pitcher,
hall-of-famer. . . . Never mind.

00:55.480 --> 00:56.913
So, Sandy. . .

00:57.080 --> 00:59.310
. . .how did you sleep?

00:59.480 --> 01:01.710
Just fine. How about you?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.792
Great. Like a drunk baby.

01:04.959 --> 01:06.393
Are you hungry?

01:06.560 --> 01:08.790
Not yet. Maybe after l throw up.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.673
What did you do last night?

01:10.840 --> 01:12.717
l was hoping you could fill me in.

01:12.880 --> 01:16.316
There's my little Sandy beach.

01:16.480 --> 01:19.278
Good morning, Alley-Oop.

01:19.680 --> 01:23.275
Oh, thank God. l was afraid
l was gonna have to quit drinking.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.595
So, what do you think of Sandy?

01:34.760 --> 01:38.230
Arguably the greatest southpaw
in the history of baseball.

01:39.120 --> 01:40.109
My Sandy.

01:40.840 --> 01:42.910
l don't know,
l've never seen her pitch.

01:44.800 --> 01:48.395
-But she sure can cook.
-Well, guess how we met.

01:49.000 --> 01:51.389
l suppose we can rule out
Dodger Stadium.

01:53.320 --> 01:54.514
ln cooking class.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.839
You've been taking a class?

01:57.000 --> 02:01.073
-Where do you think l go every Tuesday?
-You're not here on Tuesday nights?

02:02.080 --> 02:05.709
No, l'm in cooking class.
And guess who's the teacher?

02:05.880 --> 02:08.189
-Who?
-Sandy.

02:10.240 --> 02:11.229
Who's Sandy?

02:13.240 --> 02:14.309
That's Sandy.

02:16.480 --> 02:17.674
Great story.

02:18.720 --> 02:24.158
-Alan is my star pupil.
-And you are my star teacher.

02:25.800 --> 02:26.869
So cute.

02:27.440 --> 02:28.475
Yo.

02:30.360 --> 02:34.069
-Can l have some more bacon?
-Oh, in a jiff.

02:34.240 --> 02:39.030
My mother always said,
''A well-fed man is a happy man. ''

02:39.200 --> 02:43.352
Our mother always said, ''Here's
1 0 bucks for pizza, don't wait up. ''

02:44.600 --> 02:48.195
Oh, that reminds me, she called
and invited us for Christmas.

02:48.360 --> 02:50.237
-You told her yes, right?
-Absolutely.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.868
You and l were going
to spend Christmas together.

02:53.320 --> 02:54.639
We are.

02:54.800 --> 02:57.633
-But you're going to your mother's.
-What gave you that idea?

02:59.000 --> 03:01.195
You see, Sandy,
it's kind of a family tradition.

03:01.360 --> 03:04.397
Our mother invites us even though
she doesn't want us to come.

03:04.560 --> 03:07.028
We say yes
even though we don't wanna go.

03:07.200 --> 03:09.191
When we don't show,
though she's relieved. . .

03:09.360 --> 03:12.636
. . .she gets to complain
about what horrible children she has.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.116
lt's the perfect gift.

03:16.120 --> 03:19.396
Christmas is supposed to be about
spending time with your loved ones.

03:19.560 --> 03:21.915
Yeah, going to our mother's
would cut into that.

03:23.400 --> 03:27.234
Alan gets to spend it with his son and l
get to play Stuff the Stocking in Vegas. . .

03:27.400 --> 03:30.358
. . .with a couple
of saline-enhanced elves.

03:30.920 --> 03:33.832
Does this mean
that l'm finally going to meet your son?

03:34.240 --> 03:35.992
l guess it does.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.594
Gosh, l so hope he likes me.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.318
The way you cook. . .

03:40.480 --> 03:43.836
. . .the only problem is gonna be
keeping him from humping your leg.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.195
That's the sheets.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.875
lf you fold them while they're warm,
they don't wrinkle.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.630
Beauty, sex, cooking, laundry.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.234
Marriage, boredom, alimony, death.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.992
You are such a cynic.

04:01.160 --> 04:04.038
-And you are such a sap.
-How am l a sap?

04:04.200 --> 04:07.078
-Are you blind? She's a nester.
-What's that supposed to mean?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.800
She throws you some tail,
a couple of pieces of bacon. . .

04:09.960 --> 04:11.996
. . .and bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,
got a roommate.

04:13.560 --> 04:15.835
''Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo''?
lsn't that from Cinderella?

04:16.000 --> 04:18.036
You don't think
that bitch was a nester?

04:19.640 --> 04:23.599
Anyway, l find that a couple of drops
of lemon juice on the dryer sheet. . .

04:23.760 --> 04:25.716
. . .really freshens up the whole load.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.792
Really? l find that just a couple valiums
in my coffee. . .

04:28.960 --> 04:31.076
. . .keeps me from snapping necks.

04:35.960 --> 04:38.394
Well, hold this, please. . .

04:38.560 --> 04:43.190
. . .l'm just going to pop these on the bed
while they're still warm and toasty.

04:45.200 --> 04:49.318
So which one of you guys is slipping
the high hard one to Martha Stewart?

04:55.360 --> 04:57.999
Hey, Brandi. lt's Charlie Harper.

04:58.160 --> 04:59.957
l'm coming to Vegas for Christmas. . .

05:00.120 --> 05:04.033
. . .and was wondering if you and your
sister wanted to celebrate again.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.430
Harper.

05:08.160 --> 05:12.995
Oh, wait, it's possible that you
remember me as Dr. Philip Gonzalez.

05:13.920 --> 05:15.672
Right.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.718
Yeah, hola.

05:21.240 --> 05:24.198
Anyway, l'm sitting here making
vacation plans and l'm thinking:

05:24.360 --> 05:28.478
''Where better to commemorate the birth
of our lord than Caesar's Palace?''

05:29.680 --> 05:32.035
Hey, Charlie. Hungry?

05:32.200 --> 05:33.315
Hold on, Brandi.

05:33.480 --> 05:35.391
-Not really, but listen--
-Last chance.

05:35.560 --> 05:38.393
l'm gonna start dinner
so the kitchen's gonna be off limits.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.074
-But it's my kitchen.
-So?

05:41.560 --> 05:44.120
l just thought it was important
to point out.

05:44.600 --> 05:46.318
You're so cute.

05:48.400 --> 05:52.234
Look, Brandi, talk to your sister, work up
an estimate and l'll call you back.

05:54.600 --> 05:59.071
Oh, hi, Berta.
Oh, l've got a surprise for you.

05:59.240 --> 06:02.038
-A mini-blind brush.
-A what?

06:02.560 --> 06:04.710
l don't think Alan's blinds
have been dusted.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.348
Probably because
you didn't have the proper tool.

06:07.520 --> 06:09.909
Gee, thanks.

06:13.920 --> 06:15.319
-We gotta talk.
-l'm on it.

06:15.480 --> 06:17.710
You better be,
or else she's gonna be on it.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.394
Because now l have the proper tool.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.150
-Hey, listen.
-You had your chance, Charlie.

06:26.320 --> 06:30.154
-lf you're hungry, take a pudding cup.
-l don't want a pudding cup.

06:30.320 --> 06:34.393
-We need to establish ground rules.
-Oh, okay, l'm listening.

06:34.560 --> 06:37.552
Okay, well, first of all,
Berta's been with me for a long time.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.314
And what she lacks
in housekeeping skills. . .

06:40.480 --> 06:43.870
. . .she more than makes up for
in upper-body strength.

06:45.800 --> 06:46.789
What's that?

06:48.080 --> 06:50.150
-Rack of lamb.
-Really?

06:50.320 --> 06:52.151
-You're making that for us?
-Yep.

06:52.320 --> 06:55.517
With roasted baby potatoes
and caramelized carrots.

06:59.680 --> 07:02.069
Anyway, anyway.

07:02.240 --> 07:03.434
Ground rules.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.477
l wanna be supportive
of you and Alan--

07:05.640 --> 07:08.473
Sorry. One quick question.
Chocolate or raspberry soufflÃ©?

07:08.640 --> 07:12.030
-lt doesn't matter, the point is--
-l'll just make raspberry.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.917
Actually, l prefer chocolate.

07:16.080 --> 07:18.355
Chocolate it is.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.715
Now, why don't l mix you up
a little cocktail. . .

07:20.880 --> 07:24.668
-. . .and you can take a nap before dinner?
-A nap would be nice.

07:26.840 --> 07:28.398
Can l still have the pudding cup?

07:30.160 --> 07:32.754
Okay, but just one.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.434
l don't want you spoiling your appetite
before dinner.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.633
Thank you.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.439
Go on.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.239
-Well?
-Good news.

07:44.400 --> 07:45.913
We're having rack of lamb.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.794
Oh, no.

08:04.360 --> 08:06.874
l'm hungry. Where's Sandy?

08:07.040 --> 08:09.952
She went to get a honey-baked ham
for Christmas Eve dinner.

08:10.120 --> 08:12.475
Honey-baked ham.

08:13.160 --> 08:17.358
l find it a little ironic that despite your
warnings about her nesting instincts. . .

08:17.520 --> 08:19.750
. . .you haven't missed a single one
of her meals.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.480
Yeah, l'm a master of irony.

08:22.640 --> 08:26.110
-l thought you were going to Vegas.
-Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you?

08:26.640 --> 08:28.949
Then you'd have the whole ham
to yourself.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.397
You should talk, Porky.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.278
Who took the lasagna
under the deck. . .

08:34.440 --> 08:36.590
. . .so we wouldn't see him eat it
all himself?

08:36.760 --> 08:39.638
Who made a meatloaf sandwich
by taking a slice of meatloaf. . .

08:39.799 --> 08:42.519
. . .and putting it between
two other slices of meatloaf?

08:44.640 --> 08:47.552
l am cutting down on carbs.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.872
Yeah, it's working for you.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.439
When's the last time you looked down
in the shower and saw your testicles?

08:55.600 --> 08:59.309
l don't need to see them.
l know they're there.

08:59.480 --> 09:02.552
And what about you?
What do you call this?

09:02.720 --> 09:04.233
Goodyear or Pirelli?

09:04.880 --> 09:07.599
This, my chunky friend,
is water weight.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.318
Water weight.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.152
lt's genetic. l retain water.

09:11.800 --> 09:16.157
You also retain German chocolate cake,
lamb stew and Belgian waffles.

09:19.000 --> 09:24.199
Hey, people who live in fat asses
shouldn't throw waffles.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.157
Don't talk about my ass.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.356
l am very self-conscious about my ass.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.192
l'm-- l'm sorry.

09:30.360 --> 09:35.559
l'm just lashing out
because l haven't eaten in 75 minutes.

09:35.720 --> 09:37.392
Want some of Sandy's
homemade fudge?

09:38.680 --> 09:39.999
Don't play with me, Alan.

09:41.640 --> 09:44.438
-You've got fudge up here?
-Close your eyes.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.549
Okay.

09:55.800 --> 09:56.994
Fudge.

09:59.600 --> 10:01.033
You know what would be great?

10:01.200 --> 10:03.668
Honey-baked fudge.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.192
Or. . .

10:06.360 --> 10:07.839
. . .fudge-covered ham.

10:13.760 --> 10:16.433
Well, l'm really happy we get
to spend Christmas together.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.670
We don't have to go
to your mom's, do we?

10:18.840 --> 10:20.910
Don't be silly.

10:21.600 --> 10:23.238
Hey, you hungry?

10:23.400 --> 10:27.154
-l could eat.
-Well, you're gonna.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.390
Can we order Chinese
like we did last year?

10:29.560 --> 10:32.597
No, this year we're gonna
do something a little more traditional.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.751
Deli?

10:34.920 --> 10:38.515
No, we're gonna have a real,
home-cooked Christmas dinner.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.796
Whose home?

10:40.960 --> 10:43.952
-Our home.
-How?

10:44.520 --> 10:49.036
Well, l am dating a lady who's
gonna make us a wonderful dinner.

10:49.480 --> 10:50.629
Oh, okay.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.552
Are you at all curious?

10:53.720 --> 10:55.278
Yeah, a little.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.796
Okay, you can ask me any question
and l'll try and answer it for you.

10:59.440 --> 11:01.078
What are we having?

11:01.240 --> 11:02.912
No, about the lady.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.552
No, not really.

11:05.720 --> 11:08.393
Well, l just want you to know
that l really like her. . .

11:08.560 --> 11:11.279
. . .and you're probably gonna
be seeing her a lot.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.078
Do l have to like her?

11:13.240 --> 11:17.153
-Well, of course not.
-Then l probably won't.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.119
Why would you say that?

11:19.600 --> 11:22.478
We're very different people, Dad.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.518
So true.

11:25.680 --> 11:28.353
ls she gonna be staying over?

11:29.080 --> 11:31.878
-Yes.
-Where is she gonna sleep?

11:32.040 --> 11:33.155
ln my room.

11:33.920 --> 11:35.399
Okay.

11:35.560 --> 11:39.189
Just remember, the walls are thin
and l'm impressionable.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.632
Hey, what are you doing out here?

11:50.440 --> 11:51.953
l thought l should prepare you.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.389
For what?

11:54.160 --> 11:55.957
Alan.

11:57.160 --> 11:58.912
Remember what l told you
about nesters?

11:59.080 --> 12:00.308
Yeah.

12:00.480 --> 12:04.155
Well, some are hummingbirds,
some are robins.

12:04.320 --> 12:06.880
But you, my friend. . .

12:15.480 --> 12:19.314
. . .you've got yourself a partridge
in a freaking pear tree.

12:23.800 --> 12:26.553
-Sandy did all this?
-Yep.

12:26.720 --> 12:29.393
l think it's cool.
lt's like an amusement park.

12:29.560 --> 12:33.155
Yeah, Six Flags
Over Crazy-Ass-Chick Land.

12:33.920 --> 12:36.070
This cannot be Jake.

12:36.240 --> 12:37.878
You're too grown-up-looking.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.996
Yeah, thanks.
Are those for anybody?

12:40.520 --> 12:41.509
Help yourselves.

12:46.000 --> 12:47.592
Gingerbread.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.751
Jake, you can help me
in the kitchen.

12:49.920 --> 12:52.912
l'm making chocolate Ã©clairs
and l need an official taster.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.149
l like her.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.994
Will you look at that?
They're bonding already.

13:01.160 --> 13:04.709
Alan, your kid would join the Taliban
if they made their own s'mores.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.672
-So when did she do all this decorating?
-Hard to say.

13:09.840 --> 13:13.992
-Everything was normal until lunchtime.
-Oh, l missed lunch.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.149
What did you have?

13:16.360 --> 13:19.352
She made me a bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich. . .

13:19.520 --> 13:22.193
. . .with garlic mayonnaise
on sourdough toast.

13:22.360 --> 13:25.238
Oh, damn.

13:25.720 --> 13:27.915
Anyway, after lunch l took
a little nap. . .

13:28.080 --> 13:32.119
. . .and woke up
in Santa's Village of the Damned.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.318
Why do you have to be so cynical?

13:34.480 --> 13:39.838
There is nothing wrong with decorating
your home to show a little holiday spirit.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.758
But it's not her home, is it?

13:42.240 --> 13:43.309
Well, no.

13:43.480 --> 13:47.155
-Whose home is it, Alan?
-Okay, fine, l will have a talk with her.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.197
-Hold it.
-What?

13:49.360 --> 13:51.396
After dinner, you nimrod.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.596
Anybody have room for another Ã©clair?

14:00.760 --> 14:02.557
Not unless l unbutton my pants.

14:02.720 --> 14:04.870
Mine are already unbuttoned.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.874
l took mine off when she brought out
the marshmallow yams.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.838
Okay, then. What do you say
we all go into the living room. . .

14:12.000 --> 14:13.672
. . .and sing some Christmas carols?

14:14.440 --> 14:17.432
-You mean stand up?
-l don't think l can.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.909
l'm not wearing pants.

14:20.080 --> 14:22.833
Come on, you guys,
what's Christmas without caroling?

14:23.360 --> 14:25.316
Hanukkah?

14:40.400 --> 14:41.913
Sandy? Something wrong?

14:42.080 --> 14:43.433
Who moved the reindeer?

14:44.320 --> 14:46.515
l don't know that one, but l'll wing it.

14:46.680 --> 14:50.719
Who moved the reindeer?
The savior's come

14:50.880 --> 14:53.792
He's coming to check on the rein--

14:53.960 --> 14:56.030
No, no, no.

14:57.160 --> 15:00.118
-These reindeer.
-What about them?

15:00.640 --> 15:02.596
Donner and Blitzen are out of order.

15:02.760 --> 15:04.910
-Somebody's been playing with them.
-So?

15:05.080 --> 15:06.798
So l wanna know who it was.

15:07.320 --> 15:09.834
-Jake?
-l didn't do it.

15:10.000 --> 15:10.989
Charlie?

15:12.560 --> 15:16.155
Oh, all right, l may have used one
of them as a swizzle stick.

15:17.880 --> 15:19.916
Well, no harm done.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.150
lf you must play with them,
please remember. . .

15:22.320 --> 15:25.676
. . .it's Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Vixen,
Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.989
Okay.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.469
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen,
Donner, Blitzen.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.869
-Got it.
-Say it.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.518
Donner, Blitzen.

15:36.720 --> 15:38.312
Okay, then.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.948
''The Little Drummer Boy. ''

16:12.640 --> 16:15.234
Donner, Blitzen, Donner, Blitzen.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.194
Alan. Why aren't you asleep?

16:19.960 --> 16:21.188
l don't know.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.716
Just excited about Christmas, l guess.

16:25.120 --> 16:27.839
Well, Santa won't come
while you're awake.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.072
Yeah. Yeah, l've heard that.

16:31.560 --> 16:34.120
Now close your eyes
and let visions of sugarplums. . .

16:34.280 --> 16:36.953
. . .dance through your wee little head.

16:37.120 --> 16:38.997
Okay.

16:42.240 --> 16:44.515
-Oh, no.
-What?

16:44.680 --> 16:48.389
l forgot to put out cookies
and milk for Santa.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.390
You're kidding, right?

16:51.560 --> 16:53.198
Do you want coal in your stocking?

16:53.840 --> 16:57.549
That's what you're gonna get if Santa
doesn't find a snack when he comes.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.676
l see.

16:59.840 --> 17:03.913
So you believe in the vengeful,
Old Testament Santa.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.073
Are you mocking Christmas?

17:06.240 --> 17:08.037
No, no, no. You know what?

17:08.520 --> 17:12.273
l'll take care of the milk and cookies.
You just relax and go to sleep.

17:14.200 --> 17:17.351
He sees us when we're sleeping,
you know?

17:18.520 --> 17:19.509
Right.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.476
l don't make the rules.

17:23.599 --> 17:25.431
Okay.

17:29.520 --> 17:32.876
Oh, God, oh, God

17:33.040 --> 17:36.669
Oh, God, oh, God

17:37.520 --> 17:39.476
-Charlie?
-Hang on.

17:45.040 --> 17:47.918
Okay, l'm ready for more pie.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.277
We have a serious problem here.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.078
We're out of pie?

17:52.240 --> 17:54.674
Will you listen?
There's something wrong with Sandy.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.832
Well, didn't we know that
when she agreed to sleep with you?

17:58.000 --> 18:01.959
No, no, even wronger than that.
She actually believes in Santa Claus.

18:02.120 --> 18:03.553
-Really?
-Yeah.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.519
But we still have pie?

18:06.680 --> 18:10.832
-Yes, we still have pie.
-Then what are we doing up here?

18:12.200 --> 18:14.919
l guess l could have a little sliver.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.312
You know what?

18:32.480 --> 18:35.233
l think something's wrong with Sandy.

18:35.920 --> 18:39.356
l just said that.
Do you ever listen to me?

18:40.400 --> 18:42.834
Sandy, sweetheart?

18:43.000 --> 18:46.436
-You okay?
-He's not coming.

18:46.600 --> 18:48.955
Who's not coming? Listen to this.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.029
Santa.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.433
Every year,
l try to make things perfect.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.070
And every year l fail.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.231
Mama was right.

19:02.400 --> 19:05.039
l am a naughty girl.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.836
Come on, Alan.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.274
Where are we going?

19:11.880 --> 19:14.348
l want you to teach this naughty girl
a lesson.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.317
She needs to be punished.

19:19.320 --> 19:21.709
You lucky dog.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.795
What? l'm not going in there.
She's nuts.

19:24.960 --> 19:28.270
Yeah, so?
Sex with crazy chicks is great.

19:28.440 --> 19:31.750
Make sure you pick positions where
you can see what her hands are doing.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.876
No. No, that would be
taking advantage. . .

19:34.040 --> 19:35.996
. . .of a mentally unbalanced person.

19:36.160 --> 19:38.720
Oh, Alan, that boat has sailed.

19:38.880 --> 19:42.190
You might as well hop on board
for a farewell cruise.

19:42.360 --> 19:44.715
l don't think so.
lt just wouldn't be right.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.475
Come on, Alan, l'm ready.

19:55.200 --> 19:57.350
Good night.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.519
Okay, pie for everybody.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.552
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

20:13.280 --> 20:14.838
Are you out of your mind?

20:15.000 --> 20:17.912
You've been nagging us for years
to spend Christmas with you.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.196
Only because l knew
you'd never show up.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.597
Well, we had to get out of the house.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.955
Yeah, the walls are thin
and l'm impressionable.

20:26.360 --> 20:31.115
Hold on. Stanley, put your pants on.
We'll exchange gifts later.

20:32.240 --> 20:33.229
Come on in.

20:35.720 --> 20:39.554
Dear God, look at the size of your ass.
