00:08.965 --> 00:11.068
We're taking it slow,
definitely feeling it out.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.862
I had a dream
about us going camping.

00:12.931 --> 00:14.379
- Okay.
- I mean, there's never been

00:14.448 --> 00:15.724
drama on one of our trips.

00:15.793 --> 00:17.482
-
Come on, Ravi. Come on.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.137
See ya, suckers,

00:21.206 --> 00:23.241
<i>All right, hit it.</i>

00:23.310 --> 00:24.689
- Step over your arm.
- Oh,

00:26.137 --> 00:28.758
- New team every time.
- Me and old Jeremiah.

00:28.827 --> 00:30.413

00:59.655 --> 01:01.379
It's called egg toss.

01:01.448 --> 01:03.103
So again, draw out of the pot.

01:03.172 --> 01:04.517
Gus can go first.

01:04.586 --> 01:06.931
- Well, well,
me and old Jeremiah.

01:07.000 --> 01:11.137
- Yeah! Yes! Yes!

01:11.206 --> 01:13.241
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

01:13.310 --> 01:15.620
<i>- It's like Gus and Jeremiah
are getting along</i>

01:15.689 --> 01:16.862
<i>and right now seems like</i>

01:16.931 --> 01:18.137
<i>they're honestly
past their stuff.</i>

01:18.206 --> 01:19.931
But it's like there's
an elephant in the room.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.034
- Now, I'm trusting you
not to peg me with this egg,

01:22.103 --> 01:23.896
you son of a bitch.
- I'm not gonna.

01:23.965 --> 01:25.310
Y'all losing.

01:25.379 --> 01:26.896
- Yeah, me and Jerry
about to smoke this

01:26.965 --> 01:28.241
- Okay!

01:28.310 --> 01:30.827
I think Jeremiah and Gus
being paired together

01:30.896 --> 01:33.344
for the egg toss is just--

01:33.413 --> 01:35.034
that's just
the universe at work.

01:35.103 --> 01:37.103
- All right,
everybody has their eggs.

01:37.172 --> 01:39.620
<i>I got Gus and Jeremiah
paired up for the egg toss.</i>

01:39.689 --> 01:43.517
You know, you really have to
trust and communicate very well

01:43.586 --> 01:46.068
and that's something that them
two have not been able to do.

01:46.137 --> 01:49.241
- Start.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.551
Right, one step back.

01:51.620 --> 01:52.793
- Oh,

01:52.862 --> 01:54.034
- You lucky it ain't bust.

01:56.517 --> 01:58.551
- Yeah, we got this
We got this.

01:58.620 --> 02:00.034
- Step back.
- Step back.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.793
- Ah!
- Oh, damn.

02:02.862 --> 02:06.068
- Get 'em outta here.
Get 'em out.

02:06.137 --> 02:08.931
- Cody and Candace are the
first losers in the egg toss.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.137
- Damn.
- Man, this game.

02:11.206 --> 02:13.172
- Step back.

02:13.241 --> 02:15.137
- So my strategy is
to throw floaters

02:15.206 --> 02:16.551
so that way Gus has a chance

02:16.620 --> 02:20.620
to cradle it as it comes down.

02:21.862 --> 02:24.793
- All we gotta do
is catch this one.

02:28.586 --> 02:31.965
- Whoa, touchdown, [inaudible]!

02:32.034 --> 02:33.448
that egg.

02:33.517 --> 02:35.068
So it looks like Jerry Gus
is starting off

02:35.137 --> 02:37.206
to a fresh start
but, uh, who knows?

02:37.275 --> 02:38.655
- Whoo!

02:38.724 --> 02:40.965
- We're a pretty good egg toss
team, I'll give us that.

02:41.034 --> 02:42.758
- Put it on high, son

02:42.827 --> 02:44.172
Whoo! Let's go.

02:44.241 --> 02:46.793
- This is what
a camp counselor's dream is,

02:46.862 --> 02:50.551
to see two people
that couldn't get along

02:50.620 --> 02:52.241
and now they're
high-fiving each other.

02:52.310 --> 02:56.655
- Jeremiah and Gus
just handclapped.

02:56.724 --> 02:58.068
- That's exactly
what we wanted.

02:58.137 --> 03:00.275
- All we wanted.

03:00.344 --> 03:01.758
- Two and O, baby.

03:01.827 --> 03:03.931
Gus is the king
of the camp so far.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.310
- I feel like everything
has happened for a reason

03:06.379 --> 03:07.827
and the cards
are falling where they may.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.172
<i>But at the same time,
me and Gus</i>

03:09.241 --> 03:10.551
<i>are not good by any means.</i>

03:10.620 --> 03:12.793
I'm not gonna cause any drama
while I'm here.

03:12.862 --> 03:14.137
I hope you do the same.

03:14.206 --> 03:15.689
And so that's all
he gets for now

03:15.758 --> 03:17.620
<i>because I want everybody
to have a good time.</i>

03:19.448 --> 03:21.275
- Cheers,

03:21.344 --> 03:23.758
- But my roommates, they need
to stop with this whole

03:23.827 --> 03:26.758
<i>me and Gus getting back
together on good terms again</i>

03:26.827 --> 03:28.931
because it's just
not gonna happen.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.758
- It's cold.
I'm about to go inside

03:30.827 --> 03:32.896
my tent for like a minute.

03:32.965 --> 03:34.827
Hi, PGP.

03:36.931 --> 03:38.241
<i>- They're looking pretty good.</i>

03:38.310 --> 03:40.379
- They are looking good.
- Mm-hmm.

03:40.448 --> 03:43.482
Not too shabby for what we
had to work with.

03:43.551 --> 03:46.241
Candace,
the chicken wings done.

03:46.310 --> 03:47.827
- We lost another camper.

03:47.896 --> 03:49.724
Aimee's the last chick
standing.

03:49.793 --> 03:51.551
- I think I'm gonna beat
some of the dudes.

03:51.620 --> 03:55.275
Candace loses a gold star
for not being able to hang.

03:55.344 --> 03:56.655
- When's Mardi Gras?

03:56.724 --> 03:59.793
It's like now, isn't it?
- March 3rd.

03:59.862 --> 04:02.068
- So we missed it.
- Yeah.

04:02.137 --> 04:03.896
- We still need to do
a Mardi Gras.

04:03.965 --> 04:05.689
- Yeah.
- Let's get it popping.

04:05.758 --> 04:07.000
Just in our backyard

04:07.068 --> 04:08.689
and we just call it
"Yardi Gras."

04:08.758 --> 04:09.931
- Okay.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.068
- Yardi Gras be fun for me.

04:11.137 --> 04:12.000
You know, I have
friends in Atlanta.

04:12.068 --> 04:13.275
It's only like an hour away.

04:13.344 --> 04:14.827
They can definitely pull up.
I mean, why not?

04:14.896 --> 04:16.206
It'll be fun.
Let's have a pool party.

04:16.275 --> 04:17.379
I'm just thinking
it's something we can do

04:17.448 --> 04:19.344
when we get back.
- Yardi Gras, I like it.

04:19.413 --> 04:24.379
Princess Goddess Mermaid,
queen of the Yardi Gras float.

04:24.448 --> 04:28.379
Yardi Gras!

04:31.034 --> 04:33.689
- Let's say something nice
about Aimee.

04:33.758 --> 04:35.517
- What?
- Sounds rigged.

04:35.586 --> 04:37.758
- Everybody has to say
something nice about--

04:37.827 --> 04:40.551
- Yeah, I'm gonna go to bed.
-

04:40.620 --> 04:42.068
Bye, see ya.

04:42.137 --> 04:43.724
My mama always said,
"If you can't say nothing nice,

04:43.793 --> 04:44.931
don't say anything at all."

04:45.000 --> 04:45.896
- That's why you walked away,
huh?

04:45.965 --> 04:47.206
- Yup.
-

04:47.275 --> 04:49.655
- Let's say something nice
about Jeremiah.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.275
- Dope.
- Jeremiah, I think you have

04:51.344 --> 04:54.000
the biggest, nicest muscles
in the world.

04:54.068 --> 04:55.448
- Well, thank you.
- Oh, that's sweet.

04:55.517 --> 05:00.551
- Gus, go ahead, say something
nice about Jeremiah.

05:00.620 --> 05:02.620
- Uh, I will say,

05:02.689 --> 05:04.448
uh, I do look up
to your discipline.

05:04.517 --> 05:06.137
There's not many people that
got discipline like you,

05:06.206 --> 05:07.896
so that's rare to come by.

05:07.965 --> 05:09.137
I'll give you that, for sure.
- Okay.

05:09.206 --> 05:11.896
Codi, go ahead.
- No, I think that

05:11.965 --> 05:13.620
Jeremiah, you are

05:13.689 --> 05:17.275
probably one of
the smartest people I know.

05:17.344 --> 05:18.724
- Damn, that's a
big ass compliment.

05:18.793 --> 05:21.000
- Codi must not know
a lot of people.

05:21.068 --> 05:23.275
Let's say something nice
about Kirk now.

05:23.344 --> 05:25.724
- Just--I don't even know
how to compliment this

05:25.793 --> 05:27.896
but it's just the fact
that you can go from,

05:27.965 --> 05:30.034
like, being as aggressive
as you can get

05:30.103 --> 05:31.551
to being as loving
as you can get.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.241
- Come on, crazy.
-

05:34.413 --> 05:35.448
- toe, dude.

05:35.517 --> 05:36.655
- Oh, [bleep], my bad, bro.

05:36.724 --> 05:38.689
For real.
- I love you, man. My bro.

05:38.758 --> 05:40.655
I guess that just kind of
comes as a whole

05:40.724 --> 05:41.862
as just being
passionate in general.

05:41.931 --> 05:43.206
- I really do love

05:43.275 --> 05:44.413
and care about all of y'all.

05:44.482 --> 05:45.655
I really do.

05:45.724 --> 05:46.724
- Now Gussy-poo.

05:46.793 --> 05:48.068
- Gus definitely feels things

05:48.137 --> 05:50.724
the most deepest
out of anybody I've ever met.

05:50.793 --> 05:52.689
And there's nothing wrong
with that, that's for sure.

05:52.758 --> 05:54.310
But also when I first
came into the house,

05:54.379 --> 05:57.068
I thought he had the best hair
out of anybody I've ever seen.

05:57.137 --> 05:59.965
- Even the pigtails, dog? - Not
right now.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.551
I said when you first
came into the house.

06:03.103 --> 06:04.551
- You had the
tall ass hair.

06:04.620 --> 06:07.448
- You had some
big ass hair, dog.

06:07.517 --> 06:08.862
- I mean, the fact
that me and Jeremiah

06:08.931 --> 06:10.586
can actually give each other
some kind of compliments

06:10.655 --> 06:12.344
and it's not like
putting each other down

06:12.413 --> 06:14.137
is definitely a step
in the right direction.

06:14.206 --> 06:15.689
Hopefully we can stay there.

06:15.758 --> 06:17.551
- All right,
so Codi's next, right?

06:17.620 --> 06:20.344
- I love
being around you

06:20.413 --> 06:23.068
because you light up the room

06:23.137 --> 06:25.206
and I want to be around
people like you

06:25.275 --> 06:26.517
for the rest of my life.

06:26.586 --> 06:27.793
And that's the best energy

06:27.862 --> 06:29.275
you could ever have
as a person.

06:29.344 --> 06:32.000
-
Thank you, I appreciate that.

06:32.068 --> 06:33.655
- He was about to cry
for a second.

06:33.724 --> 06:35.827
He was almost

06:35.896 --> 06:38.551
He was about to cry!
- We almost had him!

06:38.620 --> 06:39.793
- Everybody cries.

06:39.862 --> 06:41.689
- I saw it coming!
- I will say this.

06:41.758 --> 06:43.586
Ain't no problem with
being a cry baby ass bitch.

06:43.655 --> 06:46.655
I will cry like a bitch
in there, so--

06:48.689 --> 06:50.103
<i>- Yeah, we gonna have to get
this fire going, for real.</i>

06:50.172 --> 06:51.241
<i>'Cause it's getting cold.</i>

06:51.310 --> 06:53.896
<i>- ♪ We were so good, oh, oh ♪</i>

06:53.965 --> 06:56.068
<i>♪ I know we could
get back there ♪</i>

06:56.137 --> 06:57.793
<i>♪ Yes, we could ♪</i>

06:57.862 --> 06:59.655
<i>♪ ♪</i>

06:59.724 --> 07:00.965
- I'm so glad it's dark now

07:01.034 --> 07:03.517
and I can pee behind a tree
like a boy.

07:03.586 --> 07:05.551
- Candace!
- Huh?

07:05.620 --> 07:07.758
- Oh, now you're awake.
Come on.

07:07.827 --> 07:09.172
- I'm coming.
- Come on.

07:09.241 --> 07:10.724
- We're about to make s'mores.

07:10.793 --> 07:13.241
- You were zonked.
- I was.

07:13.310 --> 07:14.724
I was so hungry.

07:14.793 --> 07:16.448
What games did y'all do?
Thank you.

07:16.517 --> 07:18.034
- We all complimented
each other.

07:18.103 --> 07:20.000
- Good, I'm proud of y'all.
- You did miss that one.

07:20.068 --> 07:22.482
- I just gotta give
a round of applause

07:22.551 --> 07:26.379
for Gus and Jeremiah because--
- Yeah, we actually--

07:26.448 --> 07:28.275
- Hey, I'ma stand up
for that one.

07:28.344 --> 07:29.965
- Both stand at the table.

07:30.034 --> 07:31.896
You both gave
everybody compliments.

07:31.965 --> 07:35.344
- Yay!

07:35.413 --> 07:37.517
- Hey, know what?
Y'all shakes hands over that.

07:37.586 --> 07:39.137
- I mean, listen if--

07:39.206 --> 07:40.586
- My God!
-

07:40.655 --> 07:42.172
-
- Hey!

07:42.241 --> 07:43.689
<i>- You know, I feel like
this is the first time</i>

07:43.758 --> 07:46.379
<i>me and Jeremiah
have shook hands</i>

07:46.448 --> 07:48.655
probably ever, opposed to
when we were fighting

07:48.724 --> 07:50.655
and fist fighting last summer
so it feels pretty good.

07:50.724 --> 07:52.586
We're making progress.
It's all we can do, right?

07:52.655 --> 07:54.482
- And that's the thing.

07:54.551 --> 07:56.413
<i>- For me,
being in the house with Gus,</i>

07:56.482 --> 07:58.448
<i>we've had our animosities
towards each other</i>

07:58.517 --> 08:00.344
<i>and I definitely have
my guard up towards him.</i>

08:00.413 --> 08:02.620
<i>But as long as we're able
to just continue</i>

08:02.689 --> 08:05.965
<i>this cordial type of
relationship, so to speak,</i>

08:06.034 --> 08:08.275
I think the rest
of the house will benefit.

08:08.344 --> 08:10.000
- Hey, we're like a puzzle.
We just putting the pieces

08:10.068 --> 08:11.551
back together right now.

08:14.655 --> 08:15.758
Yardi Gras.

08:15.827 --> 08:17.068
- Cheers.
- Let's get up.

08:17.137 --> 08:19.068
Yardi Gras!

08:19.137 --> 08:20.620
Yardi Gras!

08:20.689 --> 08:22.896
- Boy, that hot tub would feel
more than fine after this.

08:22.965 --> 08:24.517
<i>- So there's a storm
coming through.</i>

08:24.586 --> 08:25.896
His name is Gus.

08:25.965 --> 08:27.827
- I am ready to get naked.
- I'm kinda down.

08:27.896 --> 08:29.517
- I need you all the way down.

08:33.827 --> 08:36.275
- So y'all, I was thinking,

08:36.344 --> 08:39.137
if the camp counsellors
don't mind,

08:39.206 --> 08:40.689
maybe that we can write down

08:40.758 --> 08:42.241
one thing that we regret

08:42.310 --> 08:44.034
since we've been on
all our vacations,

08:44.103 --> 08:46.896
light it up in the fire,
burn it,

08:46.965 --> 08:48.620
and then say how we done grown.

08:48.689 --> 08:50.034
- You know,
I think it's a good idea about

08:50.103 --> 08:51.241
Candace saying
we should write down

08:51.310 --> 08:52.620
some regrets that we have
from the past,

08:52.689 --> 08:54.310
<i>burn it, and then
just leave it there</i>

08:54.379 --> 08:56.068
<i>because there's no reason
to hold on to it any anymore.</i>

08:56.137 --> 08:58.551
And what better way to move on
than just to just to burn it?

08:58.620 --> 09:00.620
I do regret
being as petty as I do

09:00.689 --> 09:02.586
when I get
to that level sometimes.

09:02.655 --> 09:04.896
I want to burn
any, like, pettiness

09:04.965 --> 09:06.551
or, like,
fighting fire with fire.

09:06.620 --> 09:08.896
- Gus is about to throw
his regretting petty

09:08.965 --> 09:10.689
in the fire
and I'm a little worried

09:10.758 --> 09:13.551
that the fire might explode.

09:13.620 --> 09:15.137
- Sit it right in the middle.

09:15.206 --> 09:17.793
- Right into center of hell.

09:17.862 --> 09:20.689
- I regret
hitting Gus and Kirk.

09:23.034 --> 09:25.137
You ain't gon' talk to me
like that, bitch.

09:25.206 --> 09:28.482
I don't hit folks no more.
I press charges.

09:28.551 --> 09:30.965
- Good job.
-

09:31.034 --> 09:33.724
And burn.
- Burn, bitch, burn.

09:33.793 --> 09:37.551
- I wrote not giving
a fair chance to Jeremiah.

09:37.620 --> 09:38.965
I was trying to change him

09:39.034 --> 09:41.310
instead of accepting him
for who he was.

09:41.379 --> 09:42.896
- I appreciate that, Codi.

09:42.965 --> 09:44.551
I do feel like, you know,
I've definitely

09:44.620 --> 09:46.965
put my best foot forward
ever since Montana,

09:47.034 --> 09:48.724
<i>and they're really seeing it.</i>

09:48.793 --> 09:50.448
<i>It's always a good feeling</i>

09:50.517 --> 09:52.482
when you're understood
for who you really are.

09:52.551 --> 09:56.379
I think probably my biggest
regret over vacations was--

09:56.448 --> 09:59.551
I told her this
but I regret yelling at Aimee

09:59.620 --> 10:01.172
after Nilsa got arrested.

10:01.241 --> 10:03.620
You have to listen
to my words

10:03.689 --> 10:05.172
when I talk!

10:05.241 --> 10:06.448
Goddammit!

10:06.517 --> 10:08.655
That, I'm throwing

10:08.724 --> 10:10.034
- Burn it.

10:10.103 --> 10:12.448

10:12.517 --> 10:16.551

10:16.620 --> 10:19.103

10:19.172 --> 10:20.379

10:20.448 --> 10:21.448
- 'Cause you're talking to me
like that.

10:21.517 --> 10:22.758

10:22.827 --> 10:24.241
You ain't talking
to me like that.

10:24.310 --> 10:26.206

10:26.275 --> 10:28.896
You don't know me, bro.
I'm from Atlanta.

10:28.965 --> 10:32.517
This ain't no Panama City.
This ain't no Panama City.

10:32.586 --> 10:33.689
<i>- Kirks' getting arrested.</i>

10:33.758 --> 10:35.310
- Burn him!
- I want to put him

10:35.379 --> 10:37.551
in the pits of hell!

10:37.620 --> 10:39.344
- Get him outta here!
- Get him outta here!

10:39.413 --> 10:41.344
- I'm pretty sure
all the roommates regret

10:41.413 --> 10:43.000
Dirk ever coming out
and if we can throw him

10:43.068 --> 10:44.448
into the fire
and never see him again,

10:44.517 --> 10:45.862
we will all be very happy.

10:45.931 --> 10:50.517
- Okay, so mine is
throwing a beer at Nilsa.

10:50.586 --> 10:52.793
So all of y'all.
- Whoa, Candance!

10:52.862 --> 10:55.413
Now you're acting like
a crazy ass bitch.

10:55.482 --> 10:57.931
- Put it in the pits of hell.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.862

we're burning away.

10:59.931 --> 11:01.724

<i>Y'all, let's go around
and all tell a ghost story.</i>

11:16.241 --> 11:19.965
- Oh, I actually have
a real, legit ghost story.

11:20.034 --> 11:22.137
It has to do with
this area here too.

11:22.206 --> 11:23.965
- This area?
- Mm-hmm.

11:24.034 --> 11:26.206
- There was this lady.

11:26.275 --> 11:28.275
She got pregnant by
this, like, demon.

11:28.344 --> 11:29.586
- That's up.
- Yeah.

11:29.655 --> 11:32.068
She got ready to have
the baby or whatever

11:32.137 --> 11:35.965
and it came out
and it was just,

11:36.034 --> 11:37.862
you know, hideous.
It was an ugly baby.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.068
It was just whatever.

11:39.137 --> 11:40.413
You know--
just hold on, hold on.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.241
- You don't call babies ugly.

11:42.310 --> 11:43.724
- Ugly baby.
- That's the--

11:43.793 --> 11:44.931

- Story of the ugly baby.

11:46.482 --> 11:47.931
You know, the baby
got demons in it

11:48.000 --> 11:51.000
and like that
and it's up.

11:51.068 --> 11:53.000
You know, the baby
fends for himself

11:53.068 --> 11:56.103
and then makes, you know,
a living and, you know,

[bleep], you know?

12:00.068 --> 12:02.862
- And they still say
to this day

12:02.931 --> 12:04.896
that you can hear
the baby crying.

12:08.275 --> 12:10.379

- Oh, hell no.

12:10.448 --> 12:11.965

- Oh, no, sir.

Can we call a cab?

12:23.344 --> 12:24.758
- It was a goose!

12:24.827 --> 12:26.931
- I ain't never heard of
no goose that sound like that.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.413
- He's probably constipated.

slurred words and all, Kirk.
-

16:59.068 --> 17:00.517
<i>It would be
our camp counselors</i>

17:00.586 --> 17:01.965
to make awards on paper plates

17:02.034 --> 17:03.551
and misspell all the words.

17:03.620 --> 17:07.448
- And, uh,
camp counselors' favorite,

17:07.517 --> 17:09.034
Gus Smyrnios.

17:09.103 --> 17:11.172
- Yes, I finally we got
an award where I feel loved.

17:11.241 --> 17:13.758
-
- Right, there we go.

17:13.827 --> 17:14.793
<i>- Maybe I should
start kissing ass</i>

17:14.862 --> 17:16.517
<i>more like Jeremiah more often.</i>

17:18.344 --> 17:20.413
- Good job, guys, camp's over.
Now pick all this up

17:20.482 --> 17:22.965
and let's get the
outta here, all right?

17:23.034 --> 17:24.137
I'm a proud parent.

17:24.206 --> 17:25.827
I'm a proud parent
of our campers.

17:25.896 --> 17:29.241
You know,
they've done a great--well...

17:29.310 --> 17:30.482
they've done an okay job.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.586
- Howdy, howdy,
Mr. taxi service.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.034
We came here to have fun,

17:34.103 --> 17:36.068
not let any drama
or pain get to us

17:36.137 --> 17:38.034
<i>and really just enjoy the trip

17:38.103 --> 17:39.413
<i>and I think
that's exactly what happened.</i>

17:39.482 --> 17:41.689
So Camp Peach

17:41.758 --> 17:42.862
and I'll tell anybody that.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.758

like it's Mardi Gras, beads.

18:48.965 --> 18:50.655
- I'll get some seafood bowls
going or something.

18:50.724 --> 18:52.206
- Oh, my God, I could get me
some fake titties

18:52.275 --> 18:53.931

18:54.000 --> 18:55.517

18:55.586 --> 18:56.827

19:01.758 --> 19:03.137
<i>- So if we can bring
New Orleans here,</i>

19:03.206 --> 19:05.241
I already know

19:05.310 --> 19:06.758

Devante and Caleb.

19:06.827 --> 19:08.379
They from Atlanta, right?
- Yeah.

19:08.448 --> 19:10.482
I know my boys and I feel like
they're gonna love this crew.

19:10.551 --> 19:12.137
And I feel like the crew

19:12.206 --> 19:14.137
<i>Caleb's my homie. I met him

19:30.620 --> 19:35.724
We made it, safe and sound.

19:35.793 --> 19:37.655

19:37.724 --> 19:40.275
Let him out, Codi.

19:40.344 --> 19:43.344
- Go potty.
- He already pottied on us.

19:43.413 --> 19:44.620

19:54.068 --> 19:55.655

19:55.724 --> 19:57.482
Look, there's

20:01.310 --> 20:02.379
- Nilsa Maria.

20:02.448 --> 20:04.310

20:04.379 --> 20:06.275
- Hey, she not back yet, y'all.

20:08.689 --> 20:10.793
- Daddy's home.
Yardi Gras' tomorrow.

20:10.862 --> 20:12.482
My boys, Caleb and Devante
are coming.

20:12.551 --> 20:15.344
I need to rest up today
because I do not feel good

20:15.413 --> 20:17.310
and I want to feel
great tomorrow.

20:17.379 --> 20:19.379
- Oh, home, sweet home.

20:19.448 --> 20:21.482
- We just got back
from Camp Peach

20:21.551 --> 20:25.413
and I think we did
a great job as camp advisors

20:25.482 --> 20:27.241
because everybody got along.

20:27.310 --> 20:28.827
<i>- Yeah, even people that</i>

20:28.896 --> 20:30.827
<i>we didn't think would

20:32.655 --> 20:35.000
take a bath, and go to sleep.

20:37.586 --> 20:40.379
- Patricia, Horny Goat.

20:40.448 --> 20:43.551
I'm so excited to be home
because I cannot wait

20:43.620 --> 20:46.896
to tell Patricia and Horny Goat
how camping went.

20:46.965 --> 20:49.413
Sorry I haven't been out here
to have our goat talk.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.965
But we went glamping

20:51.034 --> 20:52.827
and you're not gonna
believe this

20:52.896 --> 20:54.620
but guess what?

20:54.689 --> 20:56.965
We got Gus and Jeremiah

20:57.034 --> 20:59.793
to even give each other
compliments

20:59.862 --> 21:01.517
and they even high-fived.

21:01.586 --> 21:03.137
Can you belove that [bleep]?

21:03.206 --> 21:05.137
I don't know if Patricia
and Horny Goat are really

21:05.206 --> 21:08.000
as interested in what's
going on with Gus and Jeremiah

21:08.068 --> 21:10.172
or I think
it's just the goat food.

21:10.241 --> 21:12.310
Oh, okay, mm-hmm.

21:12.379 --> 21:13.724
Okay.

21:13.793 --> 21:15.862
See if I come back out here

Oh, my gosh.

25:04.758 --> 25:06.586

- Ah.

25:06.655 --> 25:09.103
- We've got one roommate
in a walking boot.

25:09.172 --> 25:11.827
- Lose a toe, I lose a toe.
- That's right.

25:11.896 --> 25:14.965
- And last time
we did a slip and slide,

25:15.034 --> 25:16.413
Candace almost got concussed.

25:20.275 --> 25:21.551
- That's a concussion.

25:21.620 --> 25:23.655
- And the time before that,
at my house,

25:23.724 --> 25:25.413
Aimee wanted to be
a human bowling pin

25:25.482 --> 25:28.413
and hurt her shoulder.

25:28.482 --> 25:30.379
- Oh, [bleep], my shoulder.

25:30.448 --> 25:33.965
- So I'm just waiting
to see who's gonna get hurt.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.793
- "Slide balloon neck tightly
onto the black nozzle."

25:36.862 --> 25:38.206
Okay, this shouldn't
be too hard.

25:38.275 --> 25:39.724
You know, I went to college.

25:39.793 --> 25:41.275
So I'm doing decoration.

25:41.344 --> 25:44.551
Like, basically I'm recreating
Bourbon Street.

25:44.620 --> 25:46.206
Yes, sir, you're gonna have
to move a little faster.

25:46.275 --> 25:47.586
- All right. Oh,

25:47.655 --> 25:49.896
- I'm making this place
look amazing.

25:49.965 --> 25:53.103
- Gus, suck this stuff out.

25:55.310 --> 25:56.758
- Oh, my God.

25:56.827 --> 25:59.620
It's Yardi Gras, bitches.

25:59.689 --> 26:03.689
-
It's time to party.

26:03.758 --> 26:05.551
<i>- That's what
I'm talking about!</i>

26:05.620 --> 26:08.448
- We're about to get lit.
- I better see boobies.

26:08.517 --> 26:10.034
I'm very excited.

26:10.103 --> 26:12.310
It's gonna be nice to have
some new flavor in the house,

26:12.379 --> 26:15.310
and we'll make them
show me some tatas.

26:15.379 --> 26:17.689
- Open up!

26:17.758 --> 26:19.689
- Hello!
- Hey!

26:19.758 --> 26:21.724

- Okay!

26:26.931 --> 26:29.482

- Hell, nah!

26:31.551 --> 26:34.068
I see my boys, Devante, Caleb,

26:34.137 --> 26:36.862
walking in the building.
I'm like, "Yessirski!"

26:39.344 --> 26:40.551
<i>- A lot of times going out,</i>

26:40.620 --> 26:41.965
I would call Kirk,
"Yo, we're going out."

26:42.034 --> 26:43.379
He's like, "I'm with Wren,
dude. I can't go out.

26:43.448 --> 26:44.827
<i>You know this."
So I would go out with</i>

26:44.896 --> 26:46.275
<i>literally just
Devante and Caleb.</i>

26:46.344 --> 26:47.862
<i>They're just a good time
all the time.</i>

26:50.586 --> 26:51.896
<i>- And I've definitely

26:51.965 --> 26:53.344
with both of these Toris
before in the past

26:53.413 --> 26:54.655
but that was when I was single.

26:54.724 --> 26:56.275
Oh, welcome to the beach house.

26:56.344 --> 26:59.206

26:59.275 --> 27:01.034
I'm a different Gus now.
Like, I'm seeing somebody.

27:01.103 --> 27:03.068
<i>and so I'm on my best
behavior now, I gotta be.</i>

27:03.137 --> 27:04.413
I hope y'all

27:21.068 --> 27:22.137
I've heard a lot about you.

27:22.206 --> 27:24.206
It feels so good
to have new energy

27:24.275 --> 27:25.551
in the house, girls and guys.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.068
So I live on Perdido.

27:59.551 --> 28:00.689
- Oh, Gus is tatted.

28:00.758 --> 28:02.482

I need something to drink.

28:08.758 --> 28:11.137
- Come to mama, come to mama.

28:11.206 --> 28:13.586
- Good luck, good luck.

28:13.655 --> 28:14.931
- Come on, Caleb,
you can do better than that.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.827
- Why are the dudes separated?

28:16.896 --> 28:18.413
- Get in there, get in there,
get in there!

28:18.482 --> 28:21.000
- Y'all don't see
all these fine women?

28:21.068 --> 28:22.482
All these fine women over here?

28:29.965 --> 28:31.172
Oh,

28:31.241 --> 28:34.344
- Devante, you suck.
-

28:38.689 --> 28:40.448
- Baby, I was raised by
two men, like, I love it.

28:40.517 --> 28:42.344
- Man, is that poop?
- There's poop.

28:42.413 --> 28:44.482
- In the hole, bro.
- We got poop in the hole.

28:44.551 --> 28:46.965
- That pig anywhere
and everywhere, dog.

28:47.034 --> 28:48.413
There's gonna be pig
anywhere you look.

28:48.482 --> 28:51.655
- Slide to the left.
- In the hole.

28:51.724 --> 28:53.241
- That's a real hole
right there.

28:53.310 --> 28:54.655
<i>- Everybody's
having a good time</i>

28:54.724 --> 28:56.310
<i>getting to know each other
and I'm, like,</i>

28:56.379 --> 28:59.965
yes, this is the feeling
of Yardi Gras!

29:00.034 --> 29:01.448
- Howdy, bitch?
- Howdy, howdy.

29:01.517 --> 29:03.413
It smells good in here.
- Yeah, man.

29:03.482 --> 29:05.655
I don't wanna walk outside
and it up.

29:07.827 --> 29:10.103
- You think Jeremiah's
gonna put the game down?

29:10.172 --> 29:11.931
- Absolutely not.

29:17.862 --> 29:19.275
- It's weird.
-

29:19.344 --> 29:20.931
- I feel bad 'cause I feel
like they're like

29:21.000 --> 29:22.862
why am I not
mingling but I can't.

29:22.931 --> 29:24.275
My biggest vice
has always been women.

29:24.344 --> 29:25.448
Like, I just love affection.

29:25.517 --> 29:26.689
<i>But like since I've met Sammy,</i>

29:26.758 --> 29:27.931
<i>I don't wanna do that no more.</i>

29:28.000 --> 29:29.379
I don't want to be
like the old Gus

29:29.448 --> 29:31.689
and just flirt with anything
that walks and talks.

29:31.758 --> 29:34.310
- Dang, y'all just
forgot the whole game.

29:34.379 --> 29:35.413
- No, we just came in--
- Man, you want me

29:35.482 --> 29:36.551
to burn this [bleep]?

29:36.620 --> 29:38.275
- You know what? You right.

29:38.344 --> 29:40.137
- Devante,
he's just talking, bro.

29:40.206 --> 29:42.275
And he's like me now.

29:42.344 --> 29:44.172
- He got a little--he got a
little boo thing at the cribbo.

29:44.241 --> 29:45.655
- Yeah, I got a little
boo thing back home

29:45.724 --> 29:47.379
so I can't be like

29:47.448 --> 29:48.862
doing that
that I usually--

29:48.931 --> 29:50.655
what you're used to
when we go out.

29:50.724 --> 29:52.689
I can't be doing that.
So it's weird.

29:52.758 --> 29:54.896
<i>- Gus is over here, like,
"Oh, I'm not interested.</i>

29:54.965 --> 29:57.241
I have a girl back home.
I'ma be a good Gus."

29:57.310 --> 29:59.034
I'm like,
"Gus, you say that now."

29:59.103 --> 30:00.344
- This one's a good one.

30:00.413 --> 30:01.586
Like, I don't wanna,
like, hurt the chick.

30:01.655 --> 30:02.965
- Till you start drinking.

30:03.034 --> 30:05.827
- Everybody's taking body shots
off of me now.

30:05.896 --> 30:08.413
- Ooh!
- Nasty hos.

30:08.482 --> 30:10.000
- So we shall see.

30:10.068 --> 30:11.482
- Is it something
you wanna stick with--

30:11.551 --> 30:13.551
- Ah, here's Devante,
he's the corrupter.

30:13.620 --> 30:17.517
- Do you know--do you know?
- I'm talking serious with him!

30:17.586 --> 30:19.275
- That's the thing I don't know
'cause it's so early.

30:19.344 --> 30:21.448
<i>- Gus is a huge flirt.</i>

30:21.517 --> 30:23.827
<i>So having beautiful girls
at the house</i>

30:23.896 --> 30:25.724
has to be very hard.

30:25.793 --> 30:27.344
<i>Just look at
what happened last time</i>

30:27.413 --> 30:28.551
<i>Allie and Gus were together.</i>

30:28.620 --> 30:30.689
- Oh, what up, girl?
- Hey!

30:30.758 --> 30:32.793
- Hi, guys!
- You said baby cousin.

30:32.862 --> 30:33.965
This ain't no baby.

30:35.862 --> 30:37.310
I actually love me
some Nutter Butters.

30:37.379 --> 30:40.068
<i>- But this time,
Gus has a girlfriend</i>

30:40.137 --> 30:42.448
and Sammy actually
means a lot to Gus.

30:42.517 --> 30:44.241
- The thing is, if the girl
I was talking to

30:44.310 --> 30:45.965
wasn't a good girl,
I wouldn't give a

30:46.034 --> 30:48.068
Like, I would do what I usually
do, but this one's a good one.

30:48.137 --> 30:49.689
Like, I don't wanna, like,
hurt the chick.

30:49.758 --> 30:51.896
Today's trying to be like
just a Yardi Gras, a big party.

30:51.965 --> 30:53.344
Usually, big parties ends up

30:53.413 --> 30:55.206
with a lot of bad decisions.
And like, if there was

30:55.275 --> 30:57.103
any kind of test that
I could possibly have to

30:57.172 --> 30:59.172
really, you know, test myself,
it'd definitely be this.

30:59.241 --> 31:01.034
- So you really think
she could be the one?

31:01.103 --> 31:02.689
- Well, I don't know. I mean--

31:02.758 --> 31:04.586
- Woah!
- Hey, hey!

31:04.655 --> 31:06.310

31:50.517 --> 31:52.137
You finishing that, right?

31:52.206 --> 31:53.793

Like, that's just honest truth.
Like, it is.

31:59.310 --> 32:00.931

just in case.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.310
<i>My natural personality
is kind of flirty in general.</i>

32:03.379 --> 32:05.000
So like, I'm so used
to just being that way.

32:05.068 --> 32:06.517

especially with this much

32:08.551 --> 32:10.068

32:10.137 --> 32:11.344

32:19.862 --> 32:21.448
We got a
dope ass hot tub.

32:24.724 --> 32:27.379
- I need you all the way down.

we came hella cool.

33:30.586 --> 33:32.413

33:32.482 --> 33:34.379

I moved into this,
like, crazy house.

33:36.689 --> 33:38.344
I started throwing
these wild parties.

33:38.413 --> 33:40.655
Devante and Kirk always
brought all the girls over.

33:40.724 --> 33:42.620
- It's dope that Devante
and Caleb are here

33:42.689 --> 33:44.034
and they're getting along
with my roommates.

33:44.103 --> 33:45.655
<i>They're my homies.
They're in our house.</i>

33:45.724 --> 33:47.103
- So y'all were hos.

33:47.172 --> 33:48.586
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:48.655 --> 33:50.103
- Yessir.
- Yessir.

33:50.172 --> 33:52.551
- I want everything
to be kosher, you feel me?

33:52.620 --> 33:54.275
- Ever since then like
we've been best of bros.

33:54.344 --> 33:57.655
- I know Caleb through
just mutual,

33:57.724 --> 34:00.206
just, you know, friends
and then he slid in my DMs.

34:00.275 --> 34:02.551
- Oh! And what he say though?

34:02.620 --> 34:04.793
- Something slick.

34:04.862 --> 34:06.965
- It was not!

34:07.034 --> 34:09.517
Okay, so I'm from Mississippi.

34:09.586 --> 34:12.862
I am a pansexual
Black woman from Mississippi.

34:12.931 --> 34:15.000
- Yes, ma'am!
- Pansexual, huh?

34:15.068 --> 34:17.206
- Very prideful,
very out there.

34:17.275 --> 34:19.241
- Can I ask
what is a pansexual?

34:19.310 --> 34:21.103
- I'm attracted
to personalities.

34:21.172 --> 34:23.758
So when you think of "pan,"
think of the P for personality.

34:23.827 --> 34:25.310
- Okay.
- Like, yeah, that's me.

34:25.379 --> 34:27.000
Like, I like people for who
they are, their personality.

34:27.068 --> 34:28.103
- I've never met
a pansexual before.

34:28.172 --> 34:29.827
- Oh, well, look, now you have.

34:29.896 --> 34:31.827
You can cross it off your list.
- Yeah.

34:31.896 --> 34:33.344
- Definitely dealing
with that was, you know,

34:33.413 --> 34:34.827
definitely hard
being from the South.

34:34.896 --> 34:37.379
Like, it's different.
We don't have that down there.

34:37.448 --> 34:39.068
Now, my mama's very accepting.

34:39.137 --> 34:40.206
My whole family is accepting.

34:40.275 --> 34:41.517
They all love me for who I am

34:41.586 --> 34:42.931
'cause they know
they raised a bad bitch

34:43.000 --> 34:44.068
who is never gonna change.

34:46.206 --> 34:48.034
So, yeah.

34:48.103 --> 34:49.965
And, of course,
I know Tori through nightlife.

34:50.034 --> 34:52.275
You know, we do what we do.
- Tori.

34:52.344 --> 34:54.103
- What, me?
- Tell us--

34:54.172 --> 34:55.896
tell us a little bit
about your background.

34:55.965 --> 34:57.689
- I've been getting,
you know, kicked out

34:57.758 --> 34:59.758
since I was 18 on and off.

34:59.827 --> 35:02.620
My parents don't like me
that much.

35:02.689 --> 35:03.862
They love me
but they don't like me.

35:03.931 --> 35:05.172
I'm way different than them.

35:05.241 --> 35:07.551
Their values,
like, oh, you can't drink.

35:07.620 --> 35:09.241
Oh, you can't go out, like--

35:09.310 --> 35:10.862
so, like,
I've always been an outsider.

35:10.931 --> 35:12.310
I've always been getting
kicked out on the street

35:12.379 --> 35:13.689
with trash bags and--

35:13.758 --> 35:15.379
- I'm like that with
my parents too. I feel ya.

35:15.448 --> 35:17.241
<i>- Blonde Tori was, like,
kinda opening up about, like,</i>

35:17.310 --> 35:18.517
where she comes from
and her background

35:18.586 --> 35:19.862
and it's kinda similar
to some situations

35:19.931 --> 35:21.000
that I've been in too.

35:21.068 --> 35:22.655
- I know there's
a lot of love there.

35:22.724 --> 35:25.620
I'm trying to see past that,
forgive them.

35:25.689 --> 35:27.034
<i>- But like me and Sammy
have been talking</i>

35:27.103 --> 35:28.482
for two, three months
at this point.

35:28.551 --> 35:30.275
There's definitely
some real feelings involved

35:30.344 --> 35:32.517
<i>and I don't really
wanna mess anything up.</i>

35:32.586 --> 35:35.482
- So I'm trying to forgive
and forget and move on.

35:35.551 --> 35:36.758
- Hey.
- Been on my own

35:36.827 --> 35:38.103
pretty much since I was 15.

35:38.172 --> 35:40.620
I mean, I do have
a biological mother,

35:40.689 --> 35:42.689
but she just, like,
wasn't mentally there.

35:42.758 --> 35:45.137
I had my dad
who was in the military.

35:45.206 --> 35:48.310
He came out when I was,
like, nine years old.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.413
And being from Texas,
being Catholic,

35:50.482 --> 35:51.965
and in a military family,

35:52.034 --> 35:55.172
like, that's not--yeah, like,
that's not the thing to do

35:55.241 --> 35:57.724
but my stepdad,
he is a drag queen.

35:57.793 --> 36:00.275
<i>He's like one of the top
drag queens in all of the U.S.</i>

36:00.344 --> 36:02.862
Like, I love it and
I support everything for it.

36:02.931 --> 36:04.586
And I mean,
they're so supportive.

36:04.655 --> 36:07.137
They're amazing, they're great.
- Aww, that's lovely.

36:07.206 --> 36:08.586
- Yeah, I love his partner.

36:08.655 --> 36:10.034
<i>They, like,
just celebrated, like,</i>

36:10.103 --> 36:11.655
almost being there together
for 20 years.

36:11.724 --> 36:13.344
And, like, three years ago,
we just celebrated

36:13.413 --> 36:15.517
an anniversary
to legally become my dad.

36:15.586 --> 36:17.758
My stepdad has, like, his name
on my birth certificate.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.068
- Hell, yeah.
- And all of that

36:19.137 --> 36:21.034
'cause, like, yeah.
- What a brave person.

36:21.103 --> 36:22.758
- Yeah.
- That's wonderful.

36:22.827 --> 36:24.206
- That's real as
Hell yeah.

36:24.275 --> 36:25.551
- I love that, boo.

36:25.620 --> 36:27.034
- For all of us sitting
at this table right now,

36:27.103 --> 36:29.137
I know it's--it's different
'cause we all come from

36:29.206 --> 36:30.827
different backgrounds,
different religions,

36:30.896 --> 36:33.000
different sexual orientations,
whatever--

36:33.068 --> 36:35.275
whatever it may be.
But the fact of the matter,

36:35.344 --> 36:37.517
that we can sit here
and we can make it work,

36:37.586 --> 36:38.620
this is the new South.

36:38.689 --> 36:40.517
I love a good Yardi Gras.

36:40.586 --> 36:43.448
<i>We have some of the best
house guests we've had ever.</i>

36:43.517 --> 36:45.206
<i>These girls are a lot of fun</i>

36:45.275 --> 36:48.413
and they're easy
on the eyes too, so--

36:48.482 --> 36:51.586
- And can I say thank you guys
for being so welcoming.

36:51.655 --> 36:53.620
- Y'all been so great.
- And I wanna thank--

36:53.689 --> 36:55.275
thank y'all for
being the best company

36:55.344 --> 36:56.724

36:56.793 --> 36:58.068

a great time

36:58.137 --> 36:59.689
and it's good to have
y'all here, for real.

36:59.758 --> 37:01.034
- Can we get in the hot tub?

37:01.103 --> 37:02.586
'Cause, bitch,
I'm trying to get butt naked.

37:02.655 --> 37:04.827
- So we're not using this?
I spent all my good money

37:04.896 --> 37:07.551

- I'm trying to get butt naked.

37:07.620 --> 37:09.206

- Hey, bubble butt.

41:21.241 --> 41:22.206

I've missed you.

41:22.275 --> 41:23.793
- Hello.

41:23.862 --> 41:25.068
- Hey.
- It's good to see you.

41:25.137 --> 41:27.655
- Let it out, baby.
It's on like a neck bone.

41:27.724 --> 41:29.275
