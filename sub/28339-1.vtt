WEBVTT

00:02.371 --> 00:03.913
You know how you and I talk
all the time about my purpose?

00:04.162 --> 00:05.913
You think acting
could be your purpose?

00:06.454 --> 00:08.120
NOHO HANK: This is Ryan Madison.

00:08.371 --> 00:09.579
-You guys want him gone?
-BOTH: Yes

00:09.913 --> 00:11.663
BARRY BERKMAN: I followed Ryan
to take an acting class,

00:11.746 --> 00:13.329
and they say I got something.

00:13.412 --> 00:14.204
(CHEERING)

00:14.454 --> 00:15.496
MONROE FUCHES:
You're a killer, Barry.

00:15.579 --> 00:17.371
-(GUN CLICKS)
-This is all you do.

00:17.995 --> 00:19.746
Folks, Ryan Madison. He's dead.

00:19.829 --> 00:21.329
-(GUN CLICKS)
-(GUNSHOT)

00:21.746 --> 00:22.829
DETECTIVE MOSS:
I'm Detective Moss.

00:23.079 --> 00:25.537
I'm hoping one of you recognizes
the man in this photo.

00:26.204 --> 00:29.704
Be on the lookout for a man
with no discernible features.

00:29.788 --> 00:30.913
He killed your friend.

00:31.579 --> 00:33.371
MOSS:
I'm investigating the murder
of one of your students.

00:33.454 --> 00:34.746
This cannot be a thing.

00:36.329 --> 00:38.954
You took my stash house.
It's a war now.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.704
HANK: Once the guys
get to know each other,

00:41.788 --> 00:42.954
it's gonna be super great.

00:43.621 --> 00:45.496
SALLY REED:
Whatever you did tonight
to get to that place...

00:45.579 --> 00:47.537
-Wait, wait, wait!
-Do that every time.

00:47.621 --> 00:48.454
(YELLS)

00:48.829 --> 00:51.496
I'm done with all this,
starting right now.

00:53.162 --> 00:56.162
-Can we please not do this?
-It's done.

00:59.537 --> 01:00.537
BARRY: Starting now.

01:17.371 --> 01:19.871
Man (muffled voice):
Yeah? Hey, pause it.

01:19.995 --> 01:24.037
Hey, if you touch the TV,
I will kill you.

01:24.829 --> 01:27.371
I'm just telling you,
I wanna see what happens
to this dude,

01:27.454 --> 01:31.120
so just don't touch the TV,
just hold up a second.

01:31.204 --> 01:35.913
-Would you pause it?
Why? Because I wanna watch it.
-(man mumbles)

01:35.995 --> 01:38.746
And you always do this, man!

01:38.829 --> 01:43.120
-Why is this shit so fucking
hard for you, huh?
-(man mumbles)

01:43.204 --> 01:45.954
I don't even think this has
anything to do with the TV.

01:46.037 --> 01:48.579
This is some other
passive-aggressive bullshit

01:48.663 --> 01:51.954
we need to talk about.
Aah, shit.

01:52.037 --> 01:53.496
Yeah?

01:53.579 --> 01:55.704
-(gunshot)
-(man grunts)

01:55.788 --> 01:58.245
(TV playing indistinctly)

01:58.329 --> 02:00.829
(distant dogs barking)

02:05.079 --> 02:07.496
-(glass shatters)
-(man grunts)

02:07.579 --> 02:09.537
(distant dogs barking)

02:14.829 --> 02:17.496
(grunts)

02:21.704 --> 02:23.245
(sighs)

02:27.204 --> 02:28.412
(sighs)

02:28.496 --> 02:30.746
(keypad beeping)

02:30.829 --> 02:32.204
(grunts)

02:33.871 --> 02:36.496
-(keypad beeping)
-Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

02:36.579 --> 02:38.663
(growls)

02:39.412 --> 02:41.537
(panting):
Fuck.

02:44.871 --> 02:46.913
(panting)

02:49.913 --> 02:53.454
-(bullet pings)
-Aah. Oh my God.

02:53.537 --> 02:57.162
Oh my God! Oh fuck!
Oh my God!

02:57.245 --> 03:00.913
-Where is he?
-Fuches: Would you relax?
My best new guy's

03:00.995 --> 03:04.079
gonna be back with
your little package
any minute now.

03:05.329 --> 03:09.287
This isn't me.
I'm not a criminal.

03:09.371 --> 03:12.454
-I mean, someone could get hurt.
-(TV playing indistinctly)

03:12.537 --> 03:14.037
Obviously,
somebody's gonna get hurt.

03:14.120 --> 03:16.454
I mean, my guy's gonna kill
whoever's in that apartment.

03:16.537 --> 03:18.329
You know,
that's part of the idea.

03:18.412 --> 03:20.496
-(distant sirens blaring)
-(helicopter whirring)

03:20.579 --> 03:23.162
-What?
-Why are you looking
at me like that?

03:23.245 --> 03:24.995
-This was the whole plan.
-No, no.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.579
You never said anything
about anybody getting hurt.

03:27.663 --> 03:29.829
-Oh.
-(tires screech)

03:29.913 --> 03:32.746
Well, you know,
if I didn't, I should have.

03:32.829 --> 03:34.287
Oh God!

03:34.371 --> 03:36.454
-(sirens blaring)
-Officer: I saw him
go upstairs! Go! Go!

03:36.537 --> 03:39.954
-(knocking)
-There, see? Here he is.

03:40.037 --> 03:42.995
Might not have gone down
like you imagined, but, uh,

03:43.079 --> 03:44.871
at least you're getting
what you paid for, right?

03:44.954 --> 03:47.788
-Hey.
-You gave me
the wrong combination.

03:47.871 --> 03:50.037
-(helicopter whirring overhead)
-(police shouting outside)

03:50.120 --> 03:51.537
You gave us the wrong
combination.

03:51.621 --> 03:53.204
You didn't even
get the package!

03:53.287 --> 03:55.412
-(gunfire)
-(whimpering)

03:55.496 --> 03:56.871
(gunshot)

03:56.954 --> 03:58.454
I gotta get out of here!

03:58.537 --> 04:00.621
-(grunts)
-(window shatters)

04:00.704 --> 04:03.287
-(screams)
-Officer: Shit!

04:03.371 --> 04:04.913
-(pounding on door)
-Officer: Hold on!

04:04.995 --> 04:08.245
Cease fire!
Cease fire! Damn!

04:08.329 --> 04:10.746
-(sirens blaring)
-(helicopter whirring)

04:10.829 --> 04:14.371
Oh, thank God, you're here!

04:14.454 --> 04:15.913
(helicopter whirring overhead)

04:15.995 --> 04:18.120
(theme music playing)

04:20.037 --> 04:22.079
Barry (exhales):
Okay.

04:22.162 --> 04:25.371
(whispering):
All right, okay.
This is good. Okay.

04:25.454 --> 04:27.663
Newspaper man.
Here we go.

04:29.829 --> 04:33.079
All right, guys, places!
Let's-- Whoa!

04:33.162 --> 04:35.329
Hey, what's going on?
You're not in costume.

04:35.412 --> 04:37.245
No, we're not.

04:37.329 --> 04:39.162
Why are you in costume?

04:39.245 --> 04:41.913
Why am I in costume?
Because it's a dress rehearsal.

04:41.995 --> 04:43.704
Come on, you guys
should be dressed!

04:43.788 --> 04:47.120
You don't seriously think
we should keep trying
to do this, do you?

04:47.204 --> 04:50.329
Yes, we have to!
We-We-We open tomorrow, guys!

04:50.412 --> 04:53.162
Baz, that's bonkers.
Why don't we just cancel
the entire show?

04:53.245 --> 04:56.287
Cancel the... Why?!

04:56.371 --> 04:59.245
Um, because Gene had
a full-on nervous breakdown

04:59.329 --> 05:01.954
-yesterday and left?
-He was, like, sobbing.

05:02.037 --> 05:05.120
I still think part of it was
my emotional performance.

05:05.204 --> 05:08.287
Yeah. No, I'm pretty sure
it was about Moss.

05:08.371 --> 05:11.454
Remember?
He was screaming,
"Janice. Janice.

05:11.537 --> 05:14.287
-What is the point
without Janice?"
-Nah, it was me.

05:14.371 --> 05:16.329
Okay, we can't do a show
without a director, Barry,

05:16.412 --> 05:18.245
and right now,
we don't have a director!

05:18.329 --> 05:20.954
Okay, hey! Let me guess.
(speaking gibberish)
It's gonna be great!

05:21.037 --> 05:22.829
-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
-Barry: Okay? I think

05:22.913 --> 05:25.954
just Gene needs a little time
to relax and collect himself.

05:26.037 --> 05:29.537
And so until then,
um, I'll direct.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.162
-What?
-What?

05:31.245 --> 05:32.537
That seems weird.

05:32.621 --> 05:35.579
All right, so everybody,
get into costume. Let's go.

05:35.663 --> 05:37.496
Let's get this going.
We open tomorrow, guys.

05:37.579 --> 05:39.663
-Let's go! The Front Page  .
-Will you talk to him please?

05:39.746 --> 05:42.829
-Everybody move!
It's gonna be fun!
-Have you directed before?

05:42.913 --> 05:44.496
I have not directed
before, but I think--

05:44.579 --> 05:46.329
I think it's gonna
be great, guys.

05:46.412 --> 05:48.412
Let's see some real energy!

05:49.454 --> 05:52.454
-All right.
Typewriter ribbon.
-Sally: Bare--

05:53.871 --> 05:56.204
-Bare, I--
-Look at this.

05:56.287 --> 05:58.954
-This plays in the first act!
-We're not doing the show.

05:59.037 --> 06:00.788
-Yeah, we are.
-No, we're not.

06:00.871 --> 06:03.663
Look, Gene is not ready.
The man is in pain.

06:03.746 --> 06:05.412
He's broken.

06:05.496 --> 06:08.663
He needs time to process
what happened.

06:08.746 --> 06:11.079
I need time to process
what happened.

06:11.162 --> 06:12.621
It's stuck.

06:12.704 --> 06:15.871
And you need time to process
what happened.

06:15.954 --> 06:18.371
Well, we do that through
the work, right?

06:18.454 --> 06:21.037
Look, I get what it's like
to be freaked out, okay?

06:21.120 --> 06:22.871
It's like... It's like
when I shaved my head

06:22.954 --> 06:25.204
for I Never Saw Another
Butterfly  without realizing

06:25.287 --> 06:27.871
how limiting that was gonna
befor other castings.

06:27.954 --> 06:30.663
We all lose track
of what's important sometimes.

06:30.746 --> 06:33.871
Plus, you know,
it's The Front Page  .
It's a stupid farce.

06:33.954 --> 06:35.204
Yeah, but you picked it.

06:35.287 --> 06:37.829
Yeah, I picked it
before Janice was murdered.

06:40.287 --> 06:42.204
-We don't know
what happened to her.
-Yes, we do!

06:42.287 --> 06:45.371
Barry, everyone seems to know
what happened to Janice
except for you!

06:45.454 --> 06:47.954
You know, if we cancel
this show, then what was
the point?

06:49.287 --> 06:50.913
What?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.412
It's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

06:56.496 --> 06:58.537
You gotta trust me.
Trust me? Trust me.

06:58.621 --> 07:00.245
Okay, we're good.

07:00.329 --> 07:01.954
The director is ready!

07:02.037 --> 07:05.079
Noho Hank:
Dear Batir and everyone
back in Chechnya.

07:05.162 --> 07:06.412
-Hey man!
-Yo bro!

07:06.496 --> 07:09.579
In short, the LA operation
is going super great.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.704
Now, I know there is still
some small reservation

07:11.788 --> 07:14.871
about teaming up with
traditional enemies,
the Bolivians,

07:14.954 --> 07:17.454
but worry not, Batir,
they are wonderful dudes.

07:17.537 --> 07:21.287
They are unrivaled thieves and
super great at acquiring cargo.

07:21.371 --> 07:23.412
And you know
what we are good at?

07:23.496 --> 07:25.412
Repackaging said cargo.

07:25.496 --> 07:28.412
It is like yin and yang,
meant to be, peas in pod.

07:28.496 --> 07:31.537
Speaking of which,
Cristobal, their leader,
is guru mensch

07:31.621 --> 07:34.204
of highest order,
like baby Tony Robbins.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.913
Teaching us all the powerful
way of getting shit done

07:36.995 --> 07:39.454
and ruling the world
while being totally chill.

07:39.537 --> 07:41.829
He had one of the best
organic chefs in South America

07:41.913 --> 07:44.287
kidnapped and brought over
here. It took some time,

07:44.371 --> 07:47.621
but I think his brain
has been officially washed.

07:47.704 --> 07:51.120
Our recreational volleyball
is becoming legendary.

07:51.204 --> 07:55.704
P.S. I am now known
as "Bullet" for my serve.

07:55.788 --> 07:58.496
Yes, I think this is
probably the happiest

07:58.579 --> 08:00.995
I have ever been
in my life, Batir.

08:01.079 --> 08:03.120
Not only do I have
operation which may soon

08:03.204 --> 08:05.287
challenge Burmese mafia
for next highest spot

08:05.371 --> 08:06.746
on crime family rankings,

08:06.829 --> 08:09.913
but I have found a true friend
and partner in Cristobal.

08:09.995 --> 08:12.704
I can't wait for
you guys to meet him.

08:12.788 --> 08:18.245
So, in finishing, let's be
cool about the Bolivians.

08:18.329 --> 08:21.954
As Cristobal often says,

08:22.037 --> 08:25.412
we are more powerful together.

08:25.496 --> 08:27.037
God, so true.

08:28.245 --> 08:30.537
Hank, Cristobal wants
to see you.

08:32.162 --> 08:34.412
Cristobal:
It's going to be amazing.
He's going to-- Ah!

08:34.496 --> 08:36.537
Hank, come in.

08:36.621 --> 08:40.412
Have you met Esther,
head of Burmese crime family?

08:42.287 --> 08:43.829
No.

08:43.913 --> 08:47.663
Probably because she's
our biggest competitor.

08:47.746 --> 08:50.204
Of course, currently
sitting in my chair,

08:50.287 --> 08:52.579
drinking from
my fox mug.

08:52.663 --> 08:54.995
I have come to offer
you a proposition.

08:55.079 --> 08:57.871
-She talking to me?
-I think it is
very interesting.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.663
Here. Come, come.
Have a seat.

09:00.663 --> 09:02.412
(chuckling)

09:03.663 --> 09:07.245
Tell me, what is the one
thing that we here

09:07.329 --> 09:08.871
have wanted to dip
our toes in?

09:08.954 --> 09:11.079
-Chocolate.
-Heroin, Hank.

09:11.162 --> 09:12.371
Heroin, heroin.

09:12.454 --> 09:16.204
It is the one box left
unchecked in our organization

09:16.287 --> 09:18.120
that would give
us true power.

09:18.204 --> 09:19.496
Listen to this.

09:19.579 --> 09:21.871
I have established
a monastery where
I can bring

09:21.954 --> 09:24.037
anything I want
into this country,

09:24.120 --> 09:27.579
no questions asked
due to religious freedom.

09:27.663 --> 09:31.162
Guns, merchandise,
and especially drugs.

09:31.245 --> 09:34.913
-I'd offer you and Cristobal
an even share.
-Huh?

09:34.995 --> 09:37.162
Okay. Why?

09:37.245 --> 09:39.412
We were just discussing
Thomas Friedman.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.079
Did you read that one yet?

09:42.162 --> 09:45.496
Okay, you given me,
like, a lot of books.

09:45.579 --> 09:48.079
-I have not found the time.
-You must make the time.

09:48.162 --> 09:50.329
-Please do not eavesdrop.
-Thomas Friedman...

09:50.412 --> 09:53.788
-Thank you.
-...says no two countries
that have a McDonald's

09:53.871 --> 09:56.704
have ever gone to war.
Esther's point is

09:56.788 --> 09:59.621
there's enough in
Los Angeles for all of us.

09:59.704 --> 10:02.287
We give a little
McDonald's to every gang,

10:02.371 --> 10:05.537
and soon, all the gangs
will become a team.

10:05.621 --> 10:10.496
So you want to share
our stash house with her?

10:10.579 --> 10:12.663
Exactly!
And in exchange,

10:12.746 --> 10:16.537
we get Esther's team
of smugglers and assassins.

10:16.621 --> 10:19.871
Well, that is a bummer,
because I already have

10:19.954 --> 10:24.204
an army of finest killers
in all of Chechnya, so...

10:24.287 --> 10:26.871
-Um--
-...there's the door.

10:26.954 --> 10:29.120
Hank, your men...

10:29.204 --> 10:32.245
they are a little lacking
in physical skill.

10:32.329 --> 10:34.162
-They are weak.
-Okay, that is not true.

10:34.245 --> 10:37.663
And also, please keep
your voice down, all right?
They're right down there.

10:38.287 --> 10:40.079
(knife tings)

10:40.162 --> 10:41.788
Oh yeah,
I've seen this before.

10:41.871 --> 10:43.412
Chh-chh-chh-chh.
Yeah, very--

10:43.496 --> 10:45.537
Okay! Sweet Baby Jesus!

10:45.621 --> 10:47.287
-(Cristobal laughing)
-Noho Hank: Oh my God!

10:47.371 --> 10:49.037
This-- That is what I'm saying.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.287
How could we not want to be
in business with this, huh?

10:52.371 --> 10:53.788
(laughs nervously)

10:53.871 --> 10:55.954
(laughing)

10:56.037 --> 10:57.454
Noho Hank:
Okay. Oh my God.

10:57.537 --> 11:01.120
(laughing continuing)

11:01.204 --> 11:04.746
Everyone's laughing
at the hand-stabbing now.

11:04.829 --> 11:07.621
-(opera playing inside house)
-(gate creaks)

11:12.412 --> 11:15.788
-(opera grows louder)
-Mr. Cousineau?

11:17.412 --> 11:18.829
Mr. Cous--

11:18.913 --> 11:20.162
Hey, Berkman.

11:20.245 --> 11:23.079
-Hey. Uh, I can come--
-(police radio chattering)

11:24.120 --> 11:26.245
-I can come back.
-No.

11:27.496 --> 11:29.663
Barry, they're giving up.

11:29.746 --> 11:32.496
-They're quitting.
-No. All we're saying is

11:32.579 --> 11:36.371
that your cabin is
no longer considered
an active crime scene.

11:36.454 --> 11:38.329
Loach:
Here are your keys.

11:38.412 --> 11:40.579
Gene:
You keep my keys.

11:41.829 --> 11:45.871
There are thousands of acres
of woods up there.

11:45.954 --> 11:47.204
Are you searching them?

11:47.287 --> 11:50.496
No. We didn't feel
that was viable.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.704
Oh, this is madness.

11:52.788 --> 11:55.954
She could be out there
right now, cold.

11:56.037 --> 11:57.871
She could be hurt, hungry.

11:57.954 --> 12:00.704
We don't know
what happened.

12:00.788 --> 12:04.663
Nobody actually knows
what happened.

12:04.746 --> 12:06.412
Is this you and Corbin Bernsen?

12:06.496 --> 12:09.079
No, that's Ronnie Cox.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.871
-Ronnie Cox.
-Mr. Cousineau...

12:12.954 --> 12:15.663
Janice and I went
after the Chechens,

12:15.746 --> 12:18.454
and they got pissed,
so they came after her.

12:18.537 --> 12:20.995
As soon as they got her
in her car that night

12:21.079 --> 12:24.621
and off your property,
she was gone, okay?

12:25.704 --> 12:30.496
We have no cell phone pings,
no credit cards, nothing.

12:31.995 --> 12:35.079
We probably know everything
we're ever going to know,

12:35.162 --> 12:37.871
and that's just the reality.

12:39.496 --> 12:40.829
I'm sorry.

12:41.496 --> 12:43.829
(opera continuing in background)

12:47.746 --> 12:51.329
-Mae. Hi, let's go.
-Hey. Oh yeah.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.037
(door closes)

13:05.204 --> 13:09.496
Hey, Mr. Cousineau, we, uh,
we rehearsed without you today,

13:09.579 --> 13:11.412
and, uh, it was awful.

13:11.496 --> 13:13.995
I know you needed
some time to feel better,

13:14.079 --> 13:16.454
but I'm just curious when
you think you might be ready

13:16.537 --> 13:19.287
to come back
and direct the show.

13:19.371 --> 13:22.954
-I mean, I think
you look great.
-In my bedroom,

13:23.037 --> 13:25.454
under the bed,

13:25.537 --> 13:28.788
there's a mahogany box,

13:28.871 --> 13:33.412
and in that box is
a pearl-handle .38 Special,

13:33.496 --> 13:37.995
screen-used from
the movie Flashpoint,

13:38.829 --> 13:42.371
given to me by my former
roommate, Rip Torn.

13:43.537 --> 13:45.663
Do you know how
many times today

13:45.746 --> 13:48.871
I actually thought
about going in there

13:48.954 --> 13:54.329
and loading it
and giving it one last kiss?

13:54.412 --> 13:58.162
-You wanted to kiss a gun? Oh.
-Suicide, Barry.

13:58.245 --> 14:01.621
Are you not familiar
with the Japanese ritual
of hari-kari?

14:01.704 --> 14:04.329
-The baseball announcer?
-I need you out of my house.

14:04.412 --> 14:05.579
Okay.

14:06.537 --> 14:09.287
Noho Hank:
Okay, mail call, you guys!

14:09.371 --> 14:10.871
We got some coupons.

14:10.954 --> 14:14.245
Hey, Esteban, you love
Domino's right?

14:14.329 --> 14:17.079
Okay. "Want to win
a million dollars?"

14:17.162 --> 14:19.245
I'm not gonna fall
for that one, again.

14:20.245 --> 14:23.829
Hey guys!
A package from Chechnya!

14:23.913 --> 14:26.579
Maybe it's my copy
of Riverdance  on Blu-ray.

14:30.746 --> 14:34.537
Batir. Noho Hank.
I just got your package.

14:34.621 --> 14:37.287
Is this some sort of
early 40th birthday joke?

14:37.371 --> 14:40.537
Batir (over phone):
We asked you to find
and execute Goran's killer.

14:40.621 --> 14:42.871
The family feels
it was the Bolivians,

14:42.954 --> 14:46.829
but instead of executing,
you have chosen to work
with them,

14:46.913 --> 14:48.954
so now we will have
to kill you.

14:49.037 --> 14:52.704
Wow, Batir, what is with
this sour-patch attitude?

14:52.788 --> 14:55.871
Come on, man. We are bros.
We went to preschool together.

14:55.954 --> 14:58.037
There is nothing
I can do, Hank.

14:58.120 --> 15:01.037
You have chosen the Bolivians
over the family.

15:01.120 --> 15:03.204
But the Bolivians
did not kill Goran.

15:03.287 --> 15:05.537
Then, who did?

15:05.621 --> 15:07.746
-You really
want to know?
- Yes.

15:07.829 --> 15:11.204
Well, okay, then.
I'm going to tell you.

15:17.204 --> 15:19.663
Excuse me, does
this come in purple?

15:19.746 --> 15:22.537
Uh, no, but we do have it
in a heathered star ruby.

15:22.621 --> 15:23.995
What is that?

15:24.079 --> 15:26.245
Well, it's basically,
um...

15:26.329 --> 15:28.579
Well, if you were
to take red and blue

15:28.663 --> 15:31.079
and then just mix those
two elements together.

15:31.162 --> 15:32.454
So purple?

15:34.079 --> 15:36.037
Oh fuck, yeah,
it is purple, isn't it?

15:36.120 --> 15:39.287
-Is everybody who
works here British?
-Sorry, what?

15:39.371 --> 15:41.245
(British accent):
See you bought
yourself a new pair

15:41.329 --> 15:43.037
of gym pantaloons,
have you?

15:43.120 --> 15:44.954
-Yes.
-(beeping)

15:45.037 --> 15:48.746
(clears throat)
Ah, bugger, the credit card
reader's not working.

15:48.829 --> 15:50.788
Stupid card reader.

15:50.871 --> 15:53.871
Bloody card reader
more like it. (chuckles)

15:53.954 --> 15:55.954
(drops accent):
Why isn't this working?
This is crazy.

15:56.037 --> 15:57.371
Are these really $88?

15:57.454 --> 16:00.204
-Baz? Can I talk
to you for a minute?
-Hmm? Yeah.

16:00.287 --> 16:02.371
(British accent):
Top o' the morning.

16:02.454 --> 16:04.162
-Hmm?
-What is that?

16:04.245 --> 16:06.120
Okay, um...

16:06.204 --> 16:07.954
I'm just doing the thing
Mr. Cousineau talked about

16:08.037 --> 16:11.120
about us bringing our characters
out into the real world.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.079
-Mmm. Well, firstly...
-So that's what I was--

16:13.162 --> 16:15.037
-...British is not
a character, yeah?
-Hmm?

16:15.120 --> 16:18.120
Yeah, it's not. And secondly,
when the guests hear you

16:18.204 --> 16:20.287
talking like that and then
they hear me talking like this,

16:20.371 --> 16:22.037
they think that we're
both doing accents.

16:22.120 --> 16:23.995
-We look like assholes.
-(British accent): No.

16:24.079 --> 16:26.496
-Yeah, we look the silly.
-No, we're the same.

16:26.579 --> 16:29.162
Both:
What are you doing?
(gasps) Stop it!

16:29.245 --> 16:31.329
-Baz! No, we don't
sound the same.
-No, we sound the same.

16:31.412 --> 16:33.746
-We sound totally the same.
No, we sound the same.
-Please stop.

16:33.829 --> 16:36.704
Both:
Oh, this is driving me nuts.

16:36.788 --> 16:38.120
You have to stop.

16:38.204 --> 16:39.871
-You can do an accent too.
-I know I can do accents.

16:39.954 --> 16:42.204
-If you played
an Australian person.
-I wouldn't play an Australian.

16:42.287 --> 16:43.995
I would never play
an Australian.

16:44.079 --> 16:46.537
I don't want to talk
about it, but I would
never play an Australian.

16:46.621 --> 16:47.704
-Oy!
-No.

16:47.788 --> 16:49.079
-Mate.
-Stop it.

16:49.162 --> 16:50.621
Excuse me, sir?

16:51.412 --> 16:53.579
Do you work here?

16:54.287 --> 16:56.245
Yeah, um...

16:57.245 --> 16:59.412
Do you have these pants
in size medium?

17:00.412 --> 17:03.245
-Those are
women's pants.
-Shit.

17:03.329 --> 17:05.995
Look, Baz, you remember when
I got you the job here, yeah?

17:06.079 --> 17:10.454
And you got all excited
'cause you thought Lululemon
was a candy store? Yeah?

17:10.537 --> 17:12.371
Well, you've come such
a long way from there,

17:12.454 --> 17:15.454
so it would be a shame
to go back, wouldn't it?

17:15.537 --> 17:17.537
All right, so just tuck your
crazy in a little bit, yeah?

17:17.621 --> 17:19.829
-All right, yeah, okay.
-Just be chill.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.788
Jesus Christ.

17:23.954 --> 17:26.412
(whispering):
The fuck you doing here?

17:28.037 --> 17:30.412
(whispering):
Barry, it's me.
It's Hank.

17:30.496 --> 17:32.204
-I know it's Hank!
-In a wig.

17:32.287 --> 17:33.954
-I know you're
wearing a wig!
-The shirt's mine, though.

17:34.037 --> 17:35.621
I don't fucking care!
What the fuck are
you doing here?

17:35.704 --> 17:37.412
You remember how Goran
was going to kill you,

17:37.496 --> 17:39.746
and I gave you tip-off
and you used it

17:39.829 --> 17:41.704
to kill Goran
and all of my friends?

17:41.788 --> 17:43.537
-Yes. Yes. Yes.
-Remember? Garage?

17:43.621 --> 17:46.329
And I did not tell his family
about it, because if I did,

17:46.412 --> 17:49.245
-they would burn down
Los Angeles looking for you?
-Yes!

17:49.329 --> 17:52.663
Well, instead of telling
them you shot Goran...

17:53.746 --> 17:55.329
this morning I told
them it was Esther,

17:55.412 --> 17:57.287
head of the Burmese
crime family.

17:58.412 --> 18:01.746
-Why?
-Well, because A,
I don't want you to get killed,

18:01.829 --> 18:05.287
and B, Esther is throwing
complete monkey wrench

18:05.371 --> 18:07.245
into my relationship
with Cristobal.

18:07.329 --> 18:10.245
So you kill her, Goran's
family will be off my tip,

18:10.329 --> 18:13.579
and Cristobal will still
think we're two peas in pod.

18:13.663 --> 18:15.412
-Classic criss-cross.
-That's not a criss-cross.

18:15.496 --> 18:18.245
-I'm pretty sure it is.
-All right, you need
to get out of here, man.

18:18.329 --> 18:21.663
No. Barry, Barry. Okay,
just hear me, all right, um...

18:22.788 --> 18:25.329
If you don't do
this for me,

18:25.412 --> 18:28.287
-my family will kill me.
-I don't fucking care.

18:29.621 --> 18:32.120
Now get out of here,
you fucking idiot.

18:39.995 --> 18:41.496
(sighs)

18:41.579 --> 18:43.537
-Mr. Fuches?
-Yeah.

18:43.621 --> 18:45.871
Whoa! I know
what that thing is.

18:45.954 --> 18:48.829
I don't know why
you'd need my DNA.

18:48.913 --> 18:51.204
I was being held there
against my will.

18:51.287 --> 18:53.162
There's witnesses
and evidence at the scene

18:53.245 --> 18:55.287
that say otherwise,
Mr. Fuches.

18:55.371 --> 18:56.829
Oh.

18:58.204 --> 19:00.995
You got a court order
to take my DNA?

19:02.204 --> 19:05.954
Oh, oh, you think I'm gonna
give it to you voluntarily.

19:06.037 --> 19:10.746
No, see, I'm a...
I'm a law and order guy.

19:10.829 --> 19:15.913
I love my country,
I love my judicial system.

19:20.412 --> 19:22.329
Thank you.
So what I remember is,

19:22.412 --> 19:24.829
there's only two other
guys in that hotel room,

19:24.913 --> 19:27.663
and they're
both dead, so...

19:27.746 --> 19:29.871
you ain't got shit, pal.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.454
(audience murmuring)

19:36.579 --> 19:38.120
I don't see Gene.
Is he coming?

19:38.204 --> 19:40.871
Yes. I told you,
he'll be here.
I talked to him.

19:40.954 --> 19:43.995
Okay, Boo-Bare,
I don't like this gear, okay?

19:44.079 --> 19:46.579
You're acting really crazy,
but you won't talk to me.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.579
-You see this?
-(tapping)

19:48.663 --> 19:51.287
That's a wall, okay?
And it needs to come down.

19:51.371 --> 19:53.329
I'm just nervous about
the show, that's all.

19:53.412 --> 19:56.329
I think this is about
more than just the show.

19:56.412 --> 19:57.746
What did you say
to me earlier?

19:57.829 --> 19:59.913
If we don't do this,
then what was the point?

19:59.995 --> 20:02.829
What does that even mean?
Are you talking about us?

20:02.913 --> 20:04.245
I-- I don't have
time for this.

20:04.329 --> 20:06.079
We go on in 15 minutes,
all right?

20:06.162 --> 20:07.371
Barry, I...

20:07.454 --> 20:10.704
All right, everybody,
15 minutes until showtime.

20:10.788 --> 20:12.871
Let's bring it in.

20:12.954 --> 20:14.496
Come on, guys.
Who died?

20:16.496 --> 20:18.287
Oh, right.

20:19.329 --> 20:22.245
Jermaine, you said you
wanted to say something?

20:22.329 --> 20:23.995
-I did?
-Yeah.

20:24.079 --> 20:26.871
-Oh, I must've been
fucking with you.
-Great. Um...

20:26.954 --> 20:30.204
Okay, so this hasn't been easy.
I'll be the first to admit that.

20:30.287 --> 20:35.913
But The Front Page  is
a very rich and layered text,

20:35.995 --> 20:40.371
and there's a lot
of lessons in there.

20:40.454 --> 20:46.037
And I think
the most important lesson

20:46.120 --> 20:50.621
in the myriad of important...

20:51.913 --> 20:54.537
lessons is...

20:54.621 --> 20:58.621
you always put out
the newspaper.

20:59.663 --> 21:02.162
I fundamentally disagree
with you, Barry.

21:02.245 --> 21:05.746
-Sometimes no news is good news.
-Is Gene coming or not?

21:05.829 --> 21:08.537
All right, you know what,
it doesn't matter if Gene's
coming or not, okay?

21:08.621 --> 21:10.329
-Because--
-Gene's here!

21:10.412 --> 21:12.454
(mutters):
Thank God.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.579
(audience applauding)

21:14.663 --> 21:18.537
Good evening, my name is
Gene M Cousineau,

21:18.621 --> 21:20.704
and I've got
an announcement to make.

21:21.496 --> 21:23.454
I'm canceling the show.

21:23.537 --> 21:24.788
(whispers):
Thank God.

21:24.871 --> 21:26.162
(whispers):
What?

21:26.245 --> 21:28.454
Gene:
I wasn't here
to oversee the production,

21:28.537 --> 21:31.621
so I can't in good conscience
let you watch a show

21:31.704 --> 21:33.162
that bares my name.

21:33.245 --> 21:36.162
Now, I cannot give
you a refund,

21:36.245 --> 21:38.454
but I can give you
a voucher for my book

21:38.537 --> 21:42.704
or any other
Gene M Cousineau merch
that we sell in the box office.

21:43.871 --> 21:46.329
-Thank you.
-Thanks for coming.

21:51.371 --> 21:56.287
It was a winter's
morning mid-1920s.

21:56.371 --> 21:59.954
The playwright
Bertolt Brecht arose,

22:00.037 --> 22:02.329
put on his robe,
his slippers,

22:02.412 --> 22:05.746
and then he went downstairs
for the breakfast that his wife,

22:05.829 --> 22:10.496
the Austrian opera singer,
Marianne Zoff, made for him.

22:10.579 --> 22:14.871
He looked at his wife,
he looked down at the schnitzel,

22:14.954 --> 22:18.913
he looked back at his wife,
and he said,

22:18.995 --> 22:21.746
"Baby, I'm out."

22:22.579 --> 22:24.204
Well, I'm out, too.

22:24.287 --> 22:27.329
I'm shutting down
this class permanently.

22:27.412 --> 22:31.371
-(students protesting)
-Mr. Cousineau,
but teaching is your life!

22:32.371 --> 22:33.788
Janice was my life--

22:33.871 --> 22:35.829
Janice is my life.

22:35.913 --> 22:38.162
Okay. No, no.
Janice is your life.
I understand,

22:38.245 --> 22:40.287
but I'm just saying that, um,

22:40.371 --> 22:42.329
you know, the things you
tell us up here, you know,

22:42.412 --> 22:43.621
that acting's good therapy.

22:43.704 --> 22:45.621
Oh, you actually heard
something I said?

22:45.704 --> 22:47.954
No, what I'm saying is
that we could use this

22:48.037 --> 22:50.162
as an exercise
as a whole class

22:50.245 --> 22:53.579
and we could use it so you
could talk about your feelings.

22:53.663 --> 22:55.245
You want me to talk
about my feelings?

22:55.329 --> 22:59.663
This class was about you
talking about your feelings.

22:59.746 --> 23:02.287
All right. No, I...
Okay, yeah.

23:02.371 --> 23:03.621
I've got an idea.

23:03.704 --> 23:08.120
Why don't you talk about
the war, Mr. Human Icebox?

23:10.037 --> 23:13.621
Why don't you tell us about
the first man you killed?

23:17.788 --> 23:20.245
Because that's
what it would be like

23:20.329 --> 23:22.829
for me to talk about Janice.

23:24.954 --> 23:27.329
I didn't think so.

23:27.412 --> 23:28.412
Natalie...

23:28.496 --> 23:31.954
-(keys clatter)
-Bring my car around.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.454
All right, it was
outside of Sanjin.

23:40.496 --> 23:41.704
It was my first tour.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.954
(wind whistling)

23:44.037 --> 23:46.079
(indistinct chattering)

23:46.162 --> 23:47.663
I was, um...

23:47.746 --> 23:51.788
I was on firewatch
with my friend Albert...

23:56.371 --> 23:59.746
um, in an OP, and, uh--

23:59.829 --> 24:01.120
-Albert.
-Yeah?

24:01.204 --> 24:03.954
-Wanna take a look at this?
-Why? What do you see?

24:04.037 --> 24:05.621
Let me see.

24:05.704 --> 24:07.037
Let me see.

24:08.204 --> 24:10.454
Oh yeah. Yeah,
about 700 yards out, right?

24:10.537 --> 24:11.829
-You see that?
-Yeah.

24:11.913 --> 24:16.287
We saw... I don't know
what you call it, um,

24:16.371 --> 24:19.621
-some suspicious activity.
-(whispering)

24:19.704 --> 24:21.621
And, um,

24:21.704 --> 24:25.371
Albert was doing
surveillance on the...

24:27.037 --> 24:28.537
(exhales)

24:30.037 --> 24:31.621
Keep going.

24:31.704 --> 24:34.454
We weren't sure
if we should engage or not.

24:34.537 --> 24:36.704
Should we engage, sir?

24:36.788 --> 24:38.579
I'm not sure.

24:39.371 --> 24:42.454
And I asked if we should
radio Lieutenant Hubble.

24:42.537 --> 24:45.496
Uh, should we maybe radio
Lieutenant Hubble, sir?

24:45.579 --> 24:48.871
Fuck no, you don't got to radio
him, man. Take the shot, dude.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.995
-Are you sure?
-No, I'm not sure.

24:51.079 --> 24:55.913
(mimicking radio static)

24:57.245 --> 25:00.412
He says that's a green light
to shoot the guy.

25:05.954 --> 25:08.829
(wind whistling)

25:08.913 --> 25:11.704
Look, you're gonna miss anyway,
man. Just scare the fucker.

25:11.788 --> 25:13.913
(wind whistling)

25:21.120 --> 25:23.162
(grunts)
Aah, my shoulder!

25:23.245 --> 25:26.079
I forgot how these
things kick back.

25:26.162 --> 25:27.746
Jesus, Berkman, you got him!

25:27.829 --> 25:30.329
-(Albert laughing)
-Soldier: What the fuck
are you shooting at?

25:30.412 --> 25:33.579
-Berkman just took out
a sheepfucker from 700 yards!
-Fuck off.

25:33.663 --> 25:35.245
-Barry: Hey, there's more.
-What?

25:35.329 --> 25:37.037
Yeah. Look.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.871
Yeah, there's two on the rise.
Looks like they're checking out
their buddy.

25:39.954 --> 25:42.871
-(gunshot echoes)
-Albert: No way.
No, no, no, no.

25:42.954 --> 25:45.245
(gunshot echoing)

25:47.120 --> 25:49.120
You killed them
both, soldier.

25:50.621 --> 25:52.829
(whimpering):
I don't...

25:52.913 --> 25:54.829
I... I killed them.

25:54.913 --> 25:58.120
Nick (sobbing):
I killed someone.

25:58.204 --> 26:00.913
Oh God. Oh God!

26:00.995 --> 26:04.995
(anguished sobbing):
I killed someone!

26:05.079 --> 26:07.621
-I'll never be able
to forgive myself.
-Sasha: Shh, shh, shh!

26:08.621 --> 26:11.537
-Is that how it happened?
-Nick: I'm a terrible person!

26:11.621 --> 26:14.537
Motherfucker! What?

26:14.621 --> 26:17.454
(screaming)

26:17.537 --> 26:19.204
You fucking kidding me?

26:19.287 --> 26:20.663
-He got 'em!
-Both of them?

26:20.746 --> 26:23.412
Smoked both those pieces
of shit! (laughing)

26:23.496 --> 26:25.788
Dude! This silent-ass
Barry here's

26:25.871 --> 26:27.871
a fucking stone-cold
killer, fellas!

26:27.954 --> 26:29.329
From 700 yards!

26:29.412 --> 26:32.079
-Jesus, Berkman!
-That was fucking dope, man!

26:32.162 --> 26:34.079
Albert:
I was gonna take
the bib off him, forget it!

26:34.162 --> 26:35.663
(soldiers laughing)

26:35.746 --> 26:37.746
-Soldiers (chanting):
Barry Berkman!
-(clapping rhythmically)

26:37.829 --> 26:38.788
Gene:
Barry--

26:38.871 --> 26:40.746
(chanting):
Berry Berkman!

26:40.829 --> 26:42.079
Gene:
Barry?

26:42.162 --> 26:44.537
Barry Berkman!

26:44.621 --> 26:47.204
-Gene: Barry?
-(Nick weeping)

26:47.287 --> 26:50.412
Is that what
really happened?

26:50.496 --> 26:53.788
Yeah, yeah.

26:53.871 --> 26:56.995
-(weeping continuing)
-Sasha: Shh, shh, shh.
It's okay.

26:58.454 --> 27:01.037
All right, I'll see you
tomorrow at the next class.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.245
-(gasps)
-Yes.

27:02.329 --> 27:04.412
(cheering, applauding)

27:08.537 --> 27:10.954
Nick:
I know I could use a drink.
Anybody else?

27:11.037 --> 27:12.913
Sasha:
Oh my God, yes, please!

27:12.995 --> 27:15.454
You should be feeling really
proud of yourself, Barry.

27:15.537 --> 27:17.037
I mean, that was amazing.

27:17.120 --> 27:20.621
-Oh, yeah, thanks.
-No, no. Really.

27:20.704 --> 27:24.120
I mean, it was messy
and complex and...

27:24.204 --> 27:26.621
God, I didn't even know
that all those things
happened to you.

27:26.704 --> 27:29.079
I mean, that was
crazy. (sighs)

27:29.162 --> 27:31.120
You really heard me.

27:31.204 --> 27:34.371
You really let that wall
come down a little.

27:34.454 --> 27:36.287
You see what happens
when you're honest

27:36.371 --> 27:38.329
about who you
really are, Barry?

27:38.412 --> 27:40.704
Good things can happen.

27:40.788 --> 27:43.871
I mean, you just
saved the class!

27:45.204 --> 27:47.621
-Hey, do you wanna
get out of here?
-Yeah.

27:48.746 --> 27:51.079
I do, I... I just-- Shit.

27:51.162 --> 27:54.871
I said I'd have drinks
with my agent, so...

27:54.954 --> 27:58.204
I wanna be there for you,
I do, but tomorrow.

27:58.287 --> 28:00.329
Not too early.
Like around noon?

28:00.412 --> 28:04.329
After yoga, but
before an audition I have.
I'll need to prepare, okay?

28:04.412 --> 28:06.329
But you'll be there
for me, right?

28:06.412 --> 28:09.329
Yeah. And we can
definitely find a window.

28:09.412 --> 28:10.663
Okay.

28:10.746 --> 28:14.329
I'm so proud of you.
The wound is open, Barry.

28:14.412 --> 28:16.704
That's a good thing.

28:16.788 --> 28:18.871
-Amazing.
-Yeah, cool.

28:18.954 --> 28:20.371
-Good night.
-Night.

28:20.454 --> 28:22.245
Bye!

28:34.412 --> 28:38.621
-What the fuck are you doing--
-"What the fuck are you doing
here, Hank?" Yeah, I know.

28:38.704 --> 28:41.037
Right. You get the fuck
out of here. You need to leave.

28:41.120 --> 28:42.788
You called me
an idiot today.

28:42.871 --> 28:48.621
Me, the guy who, when Goran
was coming to kill you,

28:48.704 --> 28:51.371
told you to get out
of the Dodge.

28:51.454 --> 28:52.954
I mean, I saved your life.

28:53.037 --> 28:54.871
Right. Hey, man,
let's do this--

28:54.954 --> 28:57.704
I come not
wearing disguises.

28:57.788 --> 28:59.621
No more hiding.

29:01.079 --> 29:02.995
You have to understand,

29:03.079 --> 29:07.454
I'm not asking you to do
this hit, I'm telling you.

29:09.120 --> 29:10.746
Hey, Hank, relax, man.

29:10.829 --> 29:13.788
I'm relaxed, okay?

29:13.871 --> 29:16.746
I'm a super relaxed guy.

29:16.829 --> 29:19.162
But now, I'm the boss,

29:19.245 --> 29:22.663
and you really
disrespected me.

29:23.704 --> 29:25.412
So you're doing this,

29:25.496 --> 29:27.995
because if you do not...

29:28.079 --> 29:31.454
I tell Goran's family
who really killed him.

29:32.454 --> 29:34.579
And this place,

29:34.663 --> 29:37.204
and all your friends,

29:37.287 --> 29:38.621
they go bye-bye.

29:41.704 --> 29:43.329
Do you believe me now?

29:46.704 --> 29:49.079
You still think
I'm a fucking idiot?

29:49.162 --> 29:50.829
No.

29:50.913 --> 29:52.663
Good.

29:52.746 --> 29:54.371
Good.

29:55.829 --> 29:57.995
Don't fuck with me, Barry.

29:59.579 --> 30:01.537
It's not polite.

30:08.204 --> 30:11.663
-(engine starts)
-(pop music playing
over car stereo)

30:28.204 --> 30:31.579
Hey, Mae? We just got
a DNA match on CODIS

30:31.663 --> 30:34.913
from the tooth we found
in the garage where
Goran Pazar was killed.

30:37.245 --> 30:38.496
What?

30:38.579 --> 30:41.162
It's a failing business, Diana.

30:41.245 --> 30:42.995
Who opens up
a quinceañera store

30:43.079 --> 30:44.579
that's not in an
Hispanic neighborhood?

30:44.663 --> 30:48.037
I did it because of you,
and now you're leaving me.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.829
Let's just meet face-to-face.
What are you doing Saturday?

30:51.913 --> 30:53.454
What, just you, or--?

30:53.537 --> 30:55.995
(sighs)
Ronny Proxin.

30:56.079 --> 30:57.537
Hey, Loach?

30:58.746 --> 31:01.663
No, I know. I need to get
a lawyer, but-- Hello?

31:01.746 --> 31:03.204
Diana?

31:06.245 --> 31:08.913
Aah, your ex-wife, right?

31:10.037 --> 31:12.496
Man, I'm sorry.
That's gotta suck.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.454
I worry all the time
that my marriage

31:15.537 --> 31:18.329
is gonna implode
around me and...

31:18.412 --> 31:22.829
I got a kid and that would
be terrible for her.

31:22.913 --> 31:25.329
But you guys are lucky,
you don't-- you do have a kid.

31:25.412 --> 31:27.162
What do you want, Mae?

31:27.245 --> 31:29.412
Well, do you remember
we found a tooth

31:29.496 --> 31:32.788
in Pazar's garage that didn't
match anyone at the crime scene?

31:32.871 --> 31:35.287
-Yeah.
-We got a CODIS
hit on it.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.454
Monroe Fuches.

31:38.788 --> 31:41.037
-From Cleveland.
-Ohio.

31:41.120 --> 31:44.704
What was he doing
in Pazar's garage?

31:44.788 --> 31:47.287
What was he doing
in Pazar's garage?

31:47.371 --> 31:50.037
-I got it, thanks.
-We should go out there,
interview him.

31:50.120 --> 31:52.120
No, I got it.
Thank you.

31:53.496 --> 31:55.204
You're welcome.

31:55.287 --> 31:57.454
(keyboard clacking)

32:00.746 --> 32:02.704
(mutters):
Cleveland.

32:21.120 --> 32:22.704
Fucking Cleveland.

32:27.329 --> 32:28.954
Okay.

32:32.621 --> 32:34.037
