01:38.844 --> 01:40.446
Come on, Mike!

02:57.790 --> 02:59.258
Hello, good people!

02:59.258 --> 03:01.494
Hi, there!

03:01.494 --> 03:03.896
You better all grab
your courage, everybody,

03:03.896 --> 03:05.531
'cause this is
flyin' weather.

03:05.531 --> 03:07.333
Now, I'm talkin' $5

03:07.333 --> 03:09.902
for the best
five minutes
of your lives.

03:09.902 --> 03:11.570
And when you die
and Saint Peter says to you,

03:11.570 --> 03:12.805
"Hey, when were you
happiest down there?"

03:12.805 --> 03:16.409
You're gonna say,
"Well it was okay
the day I got married,

03:16.409 --> 03:19.445
"and I didn't much mind
the day I first fell in love.

03:20.479 --> 03:24.383
"But seein' the sky with
the Great Waldo Pepper,

03:24.383 --> 03:26.552
"that beats 'em all."

03:26.552 --> 03:29.355
But first, first,
who wants a free ride?

03:29.355 --> 03:31.056
Me! Me!

03:31.056 --> 03:32.891
Well, boy!

03:32.891 --> 03:37.296
Usually I try to pick
somebody that shows
more enthusiasm.

03:37.296 --> 03:39.632
But in your case,
I'll make an exception.
What's your name?

03:39.632 --> 03:41.900
Scooter.
Scooter!

03:41.900 --> 03:44.370
You look big
and strong to me, Scooter
and that's the main thing.

03:44.370 --> 03:46.439
I'm gonna need
a lot of gas.

03:46.439 --> 03:48.574
I can tell there's a lot
of riders here today.

03:49.875 --> 03:51.276
Tell you what,
you just take this

03:51.276 --> 03:53.612
to the nearest gas station,
every time I need it,
when we're all done,

03:53.612 --> 03:55.614
at the end of the day,
I'll give you a free ride.
How's that?

03:55.614 --> 03:57.650
Okay.
Atta boy.

03:57.650 --> 04:00.052
Okay, folks,
If you'll just step right
up here now...

04:22.541 --> 04:24.410
Praise the Lord.

04:51.704 --> 04:55.674
Go ahead, get in.
But what if
I don't like it?

04:55.674 --> 04:58.477
If you really hate it,
I'll give you
a second ride free.

04:58.477 --> 05:00.679
Go on. Go ahead.

05:15.961 --> 05:17.095
Okay.

05:17.963 --> 05:19.965
Attaboy, Scooter.
Keep it comin'.

05:27.606 --> 05:29.608
No, no, no.
I've changed my mind.

05:29.608 --> 05:33.546
Oh, no. No, it's okay.
Now, go ahead.

05:47.125 --> 05:49.161
Yes, sir, now who
do we have here?

05:54.099 --> 05:55.468
Okay, Scooter.

06:20.659 --> 06:22.194
Thanks.

06:31.804 --> 06:34.573
What about my free ride?

06:34.573 --> 06:38.544
Oh, I just told you that
to get you to work for me.

06:38.544 --> 06:40.045
I never take
kids up alone.

07:44.643 --> 07:46.078
You must've done
pretty good today,

07:46.078 --> 07:47.713
if what Scooter
says is right.

07:47.713 --> 07:48.814
Yes, sir.

07:48.814 --> 07:50.816
Best in over a year.

07:50.816 --> 07:52.117
Right after
the war finished,

07:52.117 --> 07:55.220
barnstorming was
like this all the time.

07:55.220 --> 07:58.691
I've been flying Nebraska
for quite a while now.

07:58.691 --> 07:59.825
Things are sure
getting tough.

07:59.825 --> 08:02.561
I guess people
are just gettin'
used to airplanes.

08:02.561 --> 08:04.296
That all you plan to do
the rest of your life,

08:04.296 --> 08:06.665
just cash for rides,
that's it?

08:06.665 --> 08:07.900
Oh, no. No, sir.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.602
Every penny I make
goes into the building

08:09.602 --> 08:11.837
of a brand new biplane
for air acrobatics.

08:11.837 --> 08:13.772
Are you
the best flyer
in the world?

08:13.772 --> 08:15.207
Hush, Scooter.

08:16.108 --> 08:18.176
Wouldn't I like to be!

08:18.176 --> 08:20.579
But there's so many
amazing pilots around

08:20.579 --> 08:22.915
that have done so many
feats with their airplanes.

08:23.782 --> 08:25.784
Sorry to disappoint
you, Scooter,

08:25.784 --> 08:28.120
but I'm gonna be
honest with you.

08:28.120 --> 08:30.188
There's just no way
that I could say

08:30.188 --> 08:32.725
I'm the best pilot
in the world.

08:32.725 --> 08:34.659
I'm the second best
flyer in the world.

08:35.594 --> 08:37.696
Who's better?

08:37.696 --> 08:40.599
In the first place,
I'd have to put the
German Ace Ernst Kessler.

08:40.599 --> 08:43.268
He shot down 70 planes
and lived to tell the tale.

08:43.268 --> 08:45.270
That don't seem right.

08:45.270 --> 08:48.273
Shooting down Americans,
that don't make a man
a hero to me.

08:48.273 --> 08:50.743
Well, maybe not,
but Kessler was special.

08:50.743 --> 08:53.746
An honest day's work,
that's what I call special.

08:53.746 --> 08:55.614
Were you in the war?

08:55.614 --> 08:56.982
In the last part of it.

08:56.982 --> 08:58.817
Did you fight Kessler?

09:00.185 --> 09:02.721
Once.

09:02.721 --> 09:05.724
We were flying patrol
over the Hurtgen wood.

09:05.724 --> 09:07.325
There were five of us,

09:07.325 --> 09:10.796
and we saw Kessler
flying below us
with one escort plane.

09:11.764 --> 09:16.001
Now, he didn't see us,
and we dove on him.

09:16.001 --> 09:19.304
Now on the first pass,
we shot down
the escort plane.

09:19.304 --> 09:20.773
But Kessler was too fast.

09:20.773 --> 09:22.207
I followed the escort plane
all the way down,

09:22.207 --> 09:23.909
just to make sure
he was finished.

09:23.909 --> 09:26.211
As I started
climbing back up,
well, I said to myself,

09:26.211 --> 09:28.781
with those odds,
Kessler'll try to make
a run for it, but he didn't.

09:28.781 --> 09:31.216
He took 'em all on.
One against four.

09:31.216 --> 09:32.885
And he was doing
the attacking!

09:32.885 --> 09:34.653
By the time
I got back up,

09:34.653 --> 09:35.888
he had shot down
three of 'em.

09:35.888 --> 09:37.790
How?

09:37.790 --> 09:40.859
Well, Landis and Swaab
were kids and...

09:42.327 --> 09:43.929
Let's see, Curtin...

09:43.929 --> 09:45.964
Well, Curtin
couldn't have been
more than 19.

09:45.964 --> 09:47.733
Well, they panicked.

09:47.733 --> 09:50.836
By the time I got back up,
he was after McKinnon.

09:50.836 --> 09:53.972
He shot a burst into him,
and Mac's plane
caught on fire.

09:53.972 --> 09:58.711
Now, Mac said that
he would never, ever
go down in flames,

09:59.778 --> 10:00.946
so he jumped.

10:00.946 --> 10:03.248
Didn't he have
a parachute?

10:03.248 --> 10:04.950
Nobody had parachutes
then, Scooter.

10:06.685 --> 10:09.254
No, he just would
rather fall to his death

10:10.255 --> 10:11.924
than burn going down.

10:11.924 --> 10:13.458
Then Kessler
dove in on me.

10:13.458 --> 10:14.960
Weren't you scared?

10:14.960 --> 10:16.895
Don't be dumb.

10:16.895 --> 10:18.897
Well, it's crazy, but...

10:20.265 --> 10:22.267
I was happy.

10:22.267 --> 10:24.369
It was just me
against him.

10:24.369 --> 10:26.972
God, he was
all over the sky!

10:26.972 --> 10:28.841
He could snap around
the head of a pin.

10:28.841 --> 10:30.809
One minute
I'd think I had him,

10:30.809 --> 10:32.711
the next, he's comin'
right at me.

10:34.379 --> 10:38.316
And then, I don't know,
he was behind me
and my guns jammed.

10:38.316 --> 10:40.753
And I pounded on
the handles and just
pounded on them

10:40.753 --> 10:43.756
until my fists were bleeding
but I couldn't unjam 'em.

10:44.957 --> 10:48.727
I was just there.
I was helpless.

10:48.727 --> 10:50.295
In his gun sights.

10:51.864 --> 10:53.398
But he didn't fire.

10:54.933 --> 10:57.870
He could see me
pounding on my guns,

10:57.870 --> 10:59.304
and he pulls up
alongside of me.

10:59.304 --> 11:01.339
Just like...
Just as close
as you are to me.

11:03.108 --> 11:04.810
And he looks at me.

11:06.779 --> 11:08.480
And he did it.
Did what?

11:10.983 --> 11:12.350
Saluted.

11:13.518 --> 11:15.754
Just like that.

11:15.754 --> 11:19.324
Over the Hurtgen wood,
Ernst Kessler saluted me.

11:21.426 --> 11:23.095
And then he peeled off

11:24.429 --> 11:26.932
and dove back
towards his lines.

12:01.399 --> 12:04.502
I can take
you folks high or low,
fast or slow,

12:04.502 --> 12:05.938
anyway you want to go.

12:05.938 --> 12:08.106
And I can land you
as soft as an old maid

12:08.106 --> 12:09.842
getting into
her feather bed.

12:09.842 --> 12:11.376
And I can fly you
over your house

12:11.376 --> 12:13.478
so you can see
who's visiting your wife.

12:13.478 --> 12:15.814
But first,
for the bravest
of the brave...

12:15.814 --> 12:17.816
- Look there!
- Look at him!

12:25.958 --> 12:27.159
All right, folks,
never mind.

12:27.159 --> 12:30.162
He's just passing through.
Passing through.

12:30.162 --> 12:32.130
Now, for the
bravest of the brave,

12:32.130 --> 12:34.099
I'll do some stunts
first for free.

12:34.499 --> 12:35.834
Look!

12:56.488 --> 12:58.023
Excuse me, folks.

12:58.023 --> 13:00.859
A fellow lover
of the blue
may be in trouble.

13:00.859 --> 13:02.560
I'll be right back.

13:15.073 --> 13:18.110
Hello, good people!
Thank you. Thank you.

13:18.110 --> 13:19.611
Before we
get started, son,
I want you to know

13:19.611 --> 13:21.579
I consider
your presence here
an act of aggression.

13:21.579 --> 13:23.148
Aggression?

13:23.148 --> 13:24.582
This is my territory.

13:24.582 --> 13:27.585
Smile, son.
We don't want to
disconcert the masses.

13:27.585 --> 13:29.054
Then fly your crate
the hell outta here.

13:29.054 --> 13:30.956
For what
conceivable reason?

13:30.956 --> 13:32.457
Nebraska's mine,
I've been working it
for two years.

13:32.457 --> 13:34.526
Friend, you just got
yourself a new partner.

13:34.526 --> 13:36.194
But these people
are mine.

13:37.629 --> 13:38.630
Then you're not leavin'?

13:38.630 --> 13:40.598
You grasp things
very well,
I can see that.

13:40.598 --> 13:41.566
But don't you
leave, either.

13:41.566 --> 13:43.435
If you
carry my gas can
into town for me

13:43.435 --> 13:45.237
I'll give you
a free lesson
at the end of the day.

13:45.237 --> 13:48.573
Judging from that landing,
you need all the help
you can get!

13:48.573 --> 13:50.943
Forgive the intrusion,
good folks,

13:50.943 --> 13:53.946
now, let's remind
ourselves where we were.

13:54.579 --> 13:56.048
Some people would say

13:56.048 --> 13:58.050
that what you're about
to see is probably

13:58.050 --> 14:02.955
the greatest exhibition
of aeronautical skill
in history the world.

14:02.955 --> 14:05.457
I myself
wouldn't go that far.

14:05.457 --> 14:08.493
It is probably
only the greatest

14:08.493 --> 14:11.930
since the invention
of the airplane.

14:11.930 --> 14:14.466
Now, this'll be
the order, folks.

14:14.466 --> 14:19.237
First, the falling leaf,
then the barrel roll,
then an inside loop.

14:19.237 --> 14:23.675
And finally a daring
low-level pass.

14:24.509 --> 14:25.643
Huh?

14:25.643 --> 14:27.645
There he goes.
Son?

14:29.514 --> 14:30.682
Son?

14:33.952 --> 14:35.087
Oh!

14:35.087 --> 14:37.689
I'd be obliged
if you'd prop me, son.

14:38.523 --> 14:39.691
Glad to.

14:39.691 --> 14:43.528
You're a good loser,
and I like good losers.

14:43.528 --> 14:45.697
Then again,
you've probably had
lots of practice.

14:46.965 --> 14:48.200
Contact.

14:49.101 --> 14:50.568
Contact.

15:25.037 --> 15:26.738
Little change in
the program, folks.

15:37.649 --> 15:40.352
My partner and I
have a little surprise
planned for you folks.

15:40.352 --> 15:45.023
How would you all
like to see the famous
Axel Olsson crash?

15:47.592 --> 15:51.329
The pond! The pond's
the safest place, Axel!

15:56.668 --> 15:58.070
That's his signal, folks.

15:58.070 --> 16:00.172
Means he's just
rarin' to go.

16:00.172 --> 16:01.773
Everybody down
to the pond.

16:10.748 --> 16:13.718
Everybody, everybody,
the thing of it is,

16:13.718 --> 16:15.620
it really makes Axel
feel appreciated,

16:15.620 --> 16:19.224
if when he's done,
assuming he's alive,
there's a reward waiting.

16:19.224 --> 16:21.259
In Wichita folks
gave $15 to $20

16:21.259 --> 16:23.295
just to see a crash
like this, up close.

16:23.295 --> 16:25.130
But you all decide,
whatever you like,
I'll take it.

16:25.130 --> 16:26.331
Thank you. Thank you.

16:29.401 --> 16:32.737
They love it, Axel!
They're good people!

16:32.737 --> 16:35.273
Now, down to
the pond, everybody.

16:35.273 --> 16:37.375
That's the best spot
to see it from.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.776
Thank you.

16:41.079 --> 16:42.046
Be sure and give
the captain

16:42.046 --> 16:43.815
a nice round
of applause
when he's finished.

16:43.815 --> 16:46.351
It just means
the world to him,
knowing you care.

17:40.905 --> 17:43.341
Hey, you!
Come back here!

17:45.777 --> 17:47.879
Come back here!

18:38.563 --> 18:40.965
That was a mistake.

18:40.965 --> 18:42.334
What?

18:42.334 --> 18:45.337
He shouldn't have
taken off his gun.

18:46.204 --> 18:48.240
Why not?

18:48.240 --> 18:50.242
Arabs behind those rocks.

18:59.484 --> 19:00.785
You like movies?

19:00.785 --> 19:03.421
Mmm-hmm.
If the clothes is nice.

19:03.421 --> 19:05.557
Is this your sweater?
Uh-huh.

19:13.798 --> 19:16.534
No, no!
Don't worry. Don't worry.

19:19.371 --> 19:21.839
You know what I'd do
if I was him?
What?

19:21.839 --> 19:24.242
Throw sand
in their eyes,
blind 'em.

19:32.016 --> 19:33.785
And you could tell
It was Kessler,

19:33.785 --> 19:35.287
because he had a black
and yellow plane,

19:35.287 --> 19:37.255
it had three wings
and looked like a wasp.

19:37.255 --> 19:38.956
Oh, that could
sting you, you mean?

19:38.956 --> 19:40.558
And he had...
Huh?

19:40.558 --> 19:42.260
Right.
Aw!

19:42.260 --> 19:43.328
And he had the name
of his girlfriend, Lola,

19:43.328 --> 19:44.896
painted along the side
of the plane.

19:44.896 --> 19:46.598
Honest?
Yeah.

19:46.598 --> 19:48.966
Oh, that would've
been the highlight
of my life.

19:48.966 --> 19:50.935
Seeing my very
own name flyin'
through the...

19:50.935 --> 19:52.937
Oh, there's Axel.
Hi, Axel!

19:52.937 --> 19:55.273
My goodness,
he's hurt himself again.
Poor thing.

19:55.273 --> 19:57.375
Hi, honey.
Axel, what happened
to you?

19:57.375 --> 19:58.843
Oh, it's a long story.

19:58.843 --> 20:00.845
Don't tell me.
I'll be too upset.

20:00.845 --> 20:02.847
I want you to meet
a friend of mine,
now, he's a pilot, too,

20:02.847 --> 20:04.649
and he's been telling me
one exciting thing
after another.

20:04.649 --> 20:07.952
Waldo, this is Axel.
Axel, this is Waldo Pepper.

20:10.855 --> 20:13.558
Smile, son,
never disconcert
the masses.

20:13.558 --> 20:15.993
Oh,
why don't you
sit down, dear?

20:18.663 --> 20:21.666
Oh, I can't hardly believe it.

20:21.666 --> 20:24.569
Me sittin' here
with two aces.

20:24.569 --> 20:26.304
Well, why don't you
tell him about

20:26.304 --> 20:27.872
when you fought
the black and
yellow German.

20:27.872 --> 20:29.441
No, no, he wasn't...

20:31.576 --> 20:33.611
He wasn't black
and yellow, Mary Beth.
His plane was.

20:33.611 --> 20:36.914
That's right.
And it had "Lola"
written on it.

20:36.914 --> 20:39.584
Lola was Kessler's
truest love.

20:39.584 --> 20:41.419
- Ernst Kessler?
- Uh-huh.

20:41.419 --> 20:43.355
You fought Ernst Kessler?

20:43.355 --> 20:45.423
He sure did.
And was it ever exciting.

20:45.423 --> 20:46.891
Just wait 'til you hear it.
Go ahead, tell him, Waldo.

20:46.891 --> 20:48.526
No. Later.
Later, maybe.

20:48.526 --> 20:49.627
No, please.

20:49.627 --> 20:51.896
No.
Do it, Waldo.

20:54.632 --> 20:56.568
Kessler could have
killed Waldo,

20:56.568 --> 20:59.637
but he let him go
on account of Waldo's
guns jamming.

20:59.637 --> 21:02.073
When Kessler
and Waldo tangled,

21:02.073 --> 21:05.343
Kessler had such
respect for Waldo,

21:05.343 --> 21:09.714
that he just
gave him a salute
and off he went.

21:09.714 --> 21:11.683
That must've
been some thrill.

21:11.683 --> 21:14.586
Uh, well,
it went by so fast.

21:14.586 --> 21:18.690
But looking back on it,
I guess I'd have to say
it was kind of exciting.

21:18.690 --> 21:21.359
Oh, he's just
being modest, Axel.

21:21.359 --> 21:23.094
That was a very
dangerous thing.

21:23.094 --> 21:25.497
That German had
already shot down
four other planes

21:25.497 --> 21:27.399
before Waldo
could stop him.

21:27.399 --> 21:29.401
Landis, Swaab,

21:30.067 --> 21:32.470
Curtin, McKinnon.

21:33.137 --> 21:34.972
Right, and...

21:37.108 --> 21:39.076
How did you know?

21:39.076 --> 21:42.380
Because they were
with me in the 14th
Scouts, Mary Beth.

21:44.048 --> 21:45.116
And when they took off
that morning,

21:45.116 --> 21:47.952
I didn't see
any Waldo Pepper
taking off with them.

21:53.157 --> 21:54.659
You didn't?

21:55.960 --> 21:57.161
There was five of 'em
in the flight.

21:57.161 --> 22:00.031
Kessler shot down four,
but he let the flight
leader live.

22:00.031 --> 22:01.633
His name was
Captain Frank Madden.

22:01.633 --> 22:04.035
He died in combat only
a couple of months later.

22:07.472 --> 22:09.407
I don't get it.

22:09.407 --> 22:11.409
You've been sitting here
with a four-flusher,
Mary Beth.

22:11.409 --> 22:13.578
He's been telling
you stories,
getting you drunk,

22:13.578 --> 22:15.079
so he can work
his way with you.

22:22.487 --> 22:23.688
Come on.

22:40.638 --> 22:42.774
It should've been me.

22:42.774 --> 22:46.177
Ladies
and gentlemen...

22:48.713 --> 22:50.448
It is my pleasure,

22:50.448 --> 22:53.651
as the head
of the Dillhoefer
Flying Circus,

22:53.651 --> 22:57.989
to present to you,
on his first
and his foremost

22:57.989 --> 23:00.592
and his final tour
of America,

23:01.092 --> 23:03.628
the greatest flyer,

23:03.628 --> 23:06.764
the most courageous
ace of aces,

23:06.764 --> 23:10.234
the most foolhardy
aerial stunt performer

23:10.234 --> 23:13.538
in this entire
civilized world,

23:13.538 --> 23:18.576
the black knight
of Germany,
Ernst Kessler!

23:24.148 --> 23:26.117
Goddamn Kraut!

23:32.089 --> 23:34.091
All right now!

23:34.091 --> 23:37.595
He's made his turn
out there, ladies
and gentlemen.

23:37.595 --> 23:41.065
And now, he's coming back.
So keep your eyes on him.

23:41.065 --> 23:44.769
He's about to perform
a spectacular victory roll!

23:44.769 --> 23:47.605
Thank you.

23:47.605 --> 23:49.807
What are you
doin' here, Ezra?
It'll be a monoplane.

23:49.807 --> 23:51.809
Here he comes, now,
gaining speed vertically.

23:51.809 --> 23:54.679
A monoplane?

23:54.679 --> 23:57.582
You mean to tell me
you're building me
a plane with only one wing?

23:57.582 --> 24:01.185
Oh, I thought you'd like
to know, the bi-plane
Is as dead as a dodo bird.

24:01.185 --> 24:04.889
And now he comes,
gaining speed. Pulling up!

24:06.824 --> 24:08.726
And there it is.

24:08.726 --> 24:11.663
It's a roll
going straight up
into the heavens.

24:11.663 --> 24:15.733
And now he comes
out of it on the top.

24:15.733 --> 24:18.703
In case you
hadn't noticed, Ezra,
that was a biplane.

24:18.703 --> 24:20.104
Exactly, it's an antique.

24:20.104 --> 24:22.907
Another
death-defying maneuver!

24:22.907 --> 24:26.143
Monoplanes fall apart.
Mine is cantilevered,
it can't fall apart.

24:26.143 --> 24:28.646
They can't pull high Gs.
Absolutely untrue!

24:28.646 --> 24:30.882
It's unstable and
unmaneuverable and...

24:33.217 --> 24:35.119
And they can't do that.

24:35.119 --> 24:37.789
When we were 10,
who built a glider
that flew a 176 feet

24:37.789 --> 24:39.023
off the top of
the Johnson barn?
You did.

24:39.023 --> 24:41.926
And who busted his butt
jumping out of a second
story window

24:41.926 --> 24:43.861
with a parachute
made of bed sheets?
I did.

24:43.861 --> 24:45.863
Then don't lecture me
on aerodynamics.

24:45.863 --> 24:47.832
Was I lecturing you?
You were.

24:47.832 --> 24:50.902
He's going
now for altitude,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:50.902 --> 24:52.570
That means...

24:52.570 --> 24:55.573
It really is a brilliant
concept, Waldo.

24:55.573 --> 24:57.742
Wait a minute.
Let go of that.

24:57.742 --> 25:00.578
DILLHOEFER Okay.
Now, here's something
to tell your grandchildren.

25:00.578 --> 25:03.915
At an altitude
of 3,000 feet,

25:04.816 --> 25:07.251
the only man alive today

25:07.251 --> 25:11.956
to do 10 full,
complete revolutions
without a crash,

25:13.257 --> 25:15.893
the death spin
of Ernst Kessler!

25:18.596 --> 25:20.698
Now, look, Waldo,
you're worried
about maneuverability.

25:20.698 --> 25:21.866
Look at the size
of that aileron...
Shut up!

25:21.866 --> 25:23.267
Huh?

25:38.282 --> 25:39.651
Four!

25:41.185 --> 25:42.586
Five!

25:43.621 --> 25:44.856
Six!

25:45.923 --> 25:47.692
Seven!

25:47.692 --> 25:48.860
Eight!

25:48.860 --> 25:50.928
Hurry up!
You're running
out of room.

25:50.928 --> 25:52.263
Nine!

25:55.900 --> 25:57.301
Ten!

26:10.715 --> 26:12.784
He is the best, isn't he?

26:12.784 --> 26:14.385
You can beat him, Waldo.

26:15.853 --> 26:17.989
In my monoplane.

26:17.989 --> 26:21.325
Here he is, folks.
He's coming in to land.

26:21.325 --> 26:25.262
The greatest aviator
in the world.
Ernst Kessler!

26:28.666 --> 26:32.269
Ladies and gentlemen,
a short intermission,

26:32.269 --> 26:36.240
during which time,
for a nominal fee...

26:36.240 --> 26:37.709
Have you test
flown it yet?

26:37.709 --> 26:40.244
As soon as it
gets an engine.

26:40.244 --> 26:42.914
I got a line on
a surplus Liberty.
All it takes is money.

26:42.914 --> 26:44.682
Here, I got lucky
last week.

26:44.682 --> 26:46.383
Then that'll do
for a down payment.

26:46.383 --> 26:48.720
Don't worry.
I'll get more.
All right.

26:51.989 --> 26:53.725
Mr. Dillhoefer.
Yeah.

26:53.725 --> 26:55.827
I'd like to
introduce myself.
I'm Waldo Pepper.

26:55.827 --> 26:57.762
Please to meet you, Pepper,
but the answer is no.

26:57.762 --> 26:59.864
I thought
we might discuss...
The answer's still no.

26:59.864 --> 27:02.266
Look, I know
who you are.

27:02.266 --> 27:04.235
You're a damn
good pilot. Right?

27:04.235 --> 27:06.003
But barnstorming ain't
what it used to be.

27:06.003 --> 27:08.372
So, now you want a job
in my Flying Circus.

27:08.372 --> 27:10.708
But do you got an act?
No! Right.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.476
Well, the answer's no,
unless you got an act.

27:12.476 --> 27:14.445
Look up there.

27:14.445 --> 27:16.247
Do you think
that pack of jackals
want to see a good pilot?

27:16.247 --> 27:17.915
They want blood.

27:17.915 --> 27:20.952
Sudden death is
my business, Pepper,
not good pilots.

27:20.952 --> 27:23.721
Wait a sec,
give me a chance,
would you please?

27:27.391 --> 27:29.927
Ah, come on.

27:29.927 --> 27:32.063
I'll give you
the same deal
I give everybody else.

27:32.063 --> 27:34.265
Now, I'm gonna
lose the Kraut
to a Western outfit

27:34.265 --> 27:35.399
at the end
of this month.

27:35.399 --> 27:36.700
That means
there's an act free.

27:36.700 --> 27:39.937
Now, you dream up a stunt
where people think
you're gonna die.

27:39.937 --> 27:44.942
No. Where people are
sure you're gonna die,
and I'll take you on.

27:44.942 --> 27:48.279
You might try wing-walking.
I hear it's very popular
down south.

27:48.279 --> 27:49.781
Good luck!

28:15.773 --> 28:18.776
Yoo-hoo!
Hey! Yoo-hoo!

28:27.118 --> 28:29.353
Hey, Waldo,
how you doin'?

28:38.562 --> 28:42.934
Well, it's an inferior
model, but it'll
suit my purposes.

28:42.934 --> 28:45.903
What do you mean?
I'm borrowing
your plane, son.

28:45.903 --> 28:50.041
What?
Yep, you wrecked mine,
remember?

28:50.041 --> 28:52.076
And it won't be
ready for a month.

28:52.076 --> 28:54.178
Hey, hey, take
your hands off that.

28:54.178 --> 28:57.081
Dillhoefer's promised me
employment provided
I come up with an act.

28:57.081 --> 29:00.117
So I'm using your plane
to improvise with.

29:00.117 --> 29:02.954
You're not using
my plane for anything.

29:02.954 --> 29:05.489
Seems the least
you can do for someone
who was in combat

29:05.489 --> 29:06.723
while you were
sitting it out.

29:06.723 --> 29:09.827
I was in combat
with the 6th Pursuit
in the Calais sector.

29:09.827 --> 29:11.395
And the only reason
I got there late

29:11.395 --> 29:13.130
was because they made me
an Instructor at the time.
Son.

29:13.130 --> 29:14.832
And I couldn't get away.
Son.

29:14.832 --> 29:16.133
I'm not a vindictive man.

29:16.133 --> 29:17.501
You learned your lesson
the other night

29:17.501 --> 29:19.436
and there's no need
for you to apologize.

29:19.436 --> 29:22.506
- Who's apologizing?
- You're both starving!

29:23.574 --> 29:25.910
Well, you are, practically!

29:25.910 --> 29:28.880
So, why don't you just
try helpin' each other?

29:44.161 --> 29:45.629
Well, what the hell
would we do, anyway?

29:45.629 --> 29:47.865
You're half crippled,
my engine's
giving me fits.

29:47.865 --> 29:49.867
Actually, I have some
ideas on the subject.

29:49.867 --> 29:51.535
Mary Beth,
can you drive?

29:51.535 --> 29:53.637
What?
Can you drive?

29:53.637 --> 29:55.172
Oh.

29:56.640 --> 29:58.475
Why?

29:58.475 --> 30:02.179
Go straight, Mary Beth!
Got it. Going straight.

30:03.981 --> 30:06.183
To the left!
You want me to go
to the left?

30:06.183 --> 30:08.185
No, you go straight!
Not me.

30:10.121 --> 30:12.223
Slow down!
You want me
to slow down?

30:12.223 --> 30:14.959
Now, go faster!
Faster, okay!

30:16.027 --> 30:17.094
Right!
What?

30:17.094 --> 30:18.495
Right. Turn it
to the right!

30:18.495 --> 30:20.264
Wait, you go straight!
Okay.

30:20.264 --> 30:22.033
To the left!

30:22.033 --> 30:23.634
What the hell
are you doing?

30:23.634 --> 30:24.735
Well,
you told me
to go faster!

30:24.735 --> 30:27.438
Do you want me
to go faster?
Not you, you're fine.

30:27.438 --> 30:28.973
Here! Here!

30:49.193 --> 30:52.997
You got to slow it down.
I can't, I'll stall out
if I go any slower.

30:52.997 --> 30:55.199
No, you won't.
Just come across
the field,

30:55.199 --> 30:58.602
go as steady as you can
and as slow as you can
and we'll adjust to you.

30:58.602 --> 31:01.138
Okay.
I hope I don't
ruin everything.

31:01.138 --> 31:04.241
Don't worry, Mary Beth,
we're doin' a great stunt!

31:10.581 --> 31:14.151
I don't want to be
a stickler for accuracy,
but you're just flying,

31:14.151 --> 31:15.987
she's just driving.

31:15.987 --> 31:17.654
I'm the one doing
a great stunt.

31:17.654 --> 31:21.692
That's true, son
and that's why you're
getting all the glory.

31:33.670 --> 31:35.539
Up to the right.
Okay, to the right.

31:35.539 --> 31:37.174
Get over.
What?

31:37.174 --> 31:40.077
More.
Oh, okay.

31:40.077 --> 31:42.279
Get over.
I'm going over.

31:42.279 --> 31:45.149
No, no, no,
don't run over it.
Oh. Oh.

31:46.583 --> 31:49.186
Faster!
Faster.

31:49.186 --> 31:51.755
Come back here!
Faster, Mary Beth!

31:51.755 --> 31:54.691
Oh, I'm going
as fast as I can!
More!

31:58.729 --> 32:00.364
Waldo.
Not now!

32:04.068 --> 32:05.569
Waldo!

32:05.569 --> 32:07.704
You're doing fine,
Mary Beth!
Just go straight.

32:07.704 --> 32:10.107
Waldo, I think you
better listen to me.

32:10.107 --> 32:11.708
Damn it, I said not now!

32:13.044 --> 32:15.179
Waldo!
I got it!

32:35.699 --> 32:38.102
What about Maudie?
You told her?
No.

32:38.102 --> 32:39.336
Why not?

32:39.336 --> 32:42.073
My sister worries
enough about you as it is.

33:07.364 --> 33:08.832
Go on, go on.

33:08.832 --> 33:10.734
It'll be okay,
go on, go on.

33:20.111 --> 33:21.245
Ezra, if you want
your lunch,

33:21.245 --> 33:23.080
it's waiting
for you inside.

33:23.080 --> 33:24.315
Guess who's home.

33:31.322 --> 33:34.391
You bastard!
You rotten bastard!

33:34.391 --> 33:36.760
Hey!

33:36.760 --> 33:39.330
Every time you
come home, you do this!

33:39.330 --> 33:42.133
You got some nerve!
Get out!

33:45.702 --> 33:47.271
Whoo!

34:03.787 --> 34:06.823
I'm sorry, Waldo.
I don't know
what got into me.

34:09.793 --> 34:13.797
I think it was seeing
you all bandaged up
again that did it.

34:13.797 --> 34:16.500
Well, I never get
to see you unless
you're all banged up.

34:18.335 --> 34:20.404
Still, I guess
it's kind of mean

34:20.404 --> 34:22.105
to throw things
at a crippled man.

34:28.145 --> 34:30.313
I'm sorry, Waldo.
I really am.

34:35.418 --> 34:37.120
Ooh.

34:42.159 --> 34:44.928
Scratch my back
and I'll forgive you.

34:44.928 --> 34:46.730
What?

34:46.730 --> 34:49.300
Scratch my back
and I'll forgive you.

34:50.301 --> 34:51.835
Okay?
Okay.

34:53.370 --> 34:56.907
Be careful.
This itching
is driving me nuts.

35:01.178 --> 35:03.180
There?
No. Higher.

35:03.180 --> 35:06.450
Okay.
Ah! Yeah, yeah.

35:10.487 --> 35:13.790
You're forgiven.

35:13.790 --> 35:16.860
Waldo, is it
always gonna be when
something's broken?

35:18.962 --> 35:20.831
My comin' back home,
you mean?

35:20.831 --> 35:22.866
Your comin' back home,
I mean.

35:24.201 --> 35:25.836
You could fly with me.

35:26.437 --> 35:28.272
Waldo, I get sick!

35:29.873 --> 35:31.408
You think, still?

35:31.408 --> 35:33.210
Well, the last time
I went up with you,

35:33.210 --> 35:36.247
all I saw was
the inside of a paper
sack the whole time.

35:37.881 --> 35:39.850
Yeah, I guess.

35:40.984 --> 35:43.520
Besides, I don't think
it would look proper.

35:53.230 --> 35:54.765
We could get married.

35:54.765 --> 35:57.268
Well, think of all
the pretty girls
you'd be missing.

35:58.369 --> 36:00.871
I'd try very hard
to cut down.

36:00.871 --> 36:02.473
Really.

36:04.808 --> 36:08.279
That's very sweet of you,
but no thanks.

36:10.447 --> 36:12.249
If I'd have married you,

36:12.249 --> 36:15.919
it would have been
before you went off to war.

36:15.919 --> 36:19.956
You were awful cute
in those days.
I'm still awful cute!

36:21.525 --> 36:23.994
And you practically
promised me
you'd get killed.

36:23.994 --> 36:25.962
I know. I know.

36:27.398 --> 36:29.232
Sorry about that.

36:31.868 --> 36:34.004
Well, I guess
you're still trying.

36:42.279 --> 36:44.448
I really do
love you, Maudie.

36:48.952 --> 36:50.654
Except in flying weather!

36:54.825 --> 36:56.327
Oh, Waldo.

36:59.296 --> 37:00.897
Hey, Maudie...

37:15.646 --> 37:17.581
Now you got
to remember that this
thing is so different

37:17.581 --> 37:19.850
and genius like,
that you might not
think it's perfect.

37:19.850 --> 37:21.585
It is perfect,
I'm not saying that.

37:21.585 --> 37:23.354
But you might think
it needs to be
touched up here.

37:23.354 --> 37:24.888
Oh, God damn,
if you don't hurry up,
I'm gonna call it off.

37:24.888 --> 37:26.957
Will you
just hold on?
Well, I haven't had a...

37:26.957 --> 37:27.958
We're coming, Ezra,
as fast as we can.

37:27.958 --> 37:29.460
I haven't had
an unlimited budget,
you know.

37:29.460 --> 37:32.896
It's not gonna look like
something out of a museum,
all clean and dusted.

37:32.896 --> 37:35.098
I'm a designer and
I don't give a damn
about clean.

37:35.098 --> 37:37.634
And that's what's
so unique about
this plane,

37:37.634 --> 37:39.870
it's the design.

37:39.870 --> 37:42.439
Concentrate on that.
The design.

37:42.439 --> 37:45.542
Well, there it is,
the Stiles Skystreak!

38:19.610 --> 38:21.945
Don't you think
it might be a little
nose heavy, Ezra?

38:21.945 --> 38:24.381
Ah, uh-huh,
here, here.

38:25.982 --> 38:27.217
What?

38:27.217 --> 38:29.553
An elevator trim tab
you operate from
inside the cockpit.

38:29.553 --> 38:31.121
What about
the horse power?
80.

38:32.723 --> 38:33.990
Will it take a 120?

38:33.990 --> 38:36.593
Well, If you send me
the money for a 120,
it'll take a 120.

38:36.593 --> 38:38.962
Hell, it'll take a 180.
Do you like it?

38:38.962 --> 38:41.965
What about the wings
with a 180?
I'll buttress the wires.

38:41.965 --> 38:43.934
I'll get an extra set
of flying wires
for the wings.

38:43.934 --> 38:45.702
Don't worry about
the god damn wings.
Do you like it?

38:45.702 --> 38:47.638
Ezra.

38:47.638 --> 38:49.506
I could do an outside
loop in this, couldn't I?

38:53.977 --> 38:57.180
Couldn't I?
Of course you could.

38:57.180 --> 38:59.416
Hell, even I could do
an outside loop
in this plane.

38:59.416 --> 39:00.417
But then,
I'm a superb pilot.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.786
What's an outside loop?
The last great stunt.

39:02.786 --> 39:04.988
Even Kessler
hasn't done it.
Why not?

39:04.988 --> 39:07.424
He's never had a plane
that could take the stress.

39:07.424 --> 39:11.161
Do you realize
if you build the
first plane to do it,

39:11.161 --> 39:13.497
and I'm the
first guy to fly it,

39:13.497 --> 39:15.466
that we could
both be very rich
and very famous?

39:15.466 --> 39:16.767
Do you think you'd
just mind that, Ez?

39:16.767 --> 39:20.170
I need some more money.
Oh! I'll get the money.

39:20.804 --> 39:22.473
He likes it!

39:31.648 --> 39:33.584
Any time you're ready.

39:44.027 --> 39:46.497
Come on, now.
Look. We flipped
and you lost.

39:47.531 --> 39:49.099
You gotta go first.

40:01.211 --> 40:03.480
We gotta find out
if we can do this.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.182
Dillhoefer won't
give us a job unless
we can wing-walk.

40:06.182 --> 40:07.518
Go on!

40:32.208 --> 40:33.777
Come on back.

40:34.678 --> 40:36.146
Get back in.

40:47.658 --> 40:50.226
I didn't like it much!

40:50.226 --> 40:52.495
All right,
get back here
and we'll switch.

41:02.205 --> 41:03.674
Come on!

41:15.552 --> 41:17.220
Hey,
take the stick.

41:17.220 --> 41:18.622
Take the stick.

41:18.622 --> 41:20.156
Now, what in the...
Watch it.

42:55.819 --> 42:59.723
Ladies
and gentlemen!

42:59.723 --> 43:02.759
The unbeaten, untied,

43:02.759 --> 43:06.429
unethical wing-walking
wonders of the world.

43:06.429 --> 43:08.832
Olsson and Pepper!

43:12.803 --> 43:15.906
Guy came through here
last week did that
standing on his head.

43:25.315 --> 43:26.917
Folks,

43:26.917 --> 43:31.287
I have always
had a warm spot
in my heart

43:31.287 --> 43:33.690
for the lovely town
of Pauth.

43:33.690 --> 43:34.791
Poth!

43:34.791 --> 43:35.992
Poth.

43:39.062 --> 43:43.767
And for your
entertainment memories,
we have a special guest,

43:43.767 --> 43:47.704
who has agreed to take
the first flight with us
this afternoon.

43:47.704 --> 43:52.475
Ladies and gentlemen,
the world-famous opera star,

43:52.475 --> 43:55.345
Madame Jessie Lund!

44:00.751 --> 44:03.920
Folks, I always
tell the boys

44:03.920 --> 44:06.723
our annual sojourn
to Great Rapids

44:06.723 --> 44:09.893
is the climax
of the year.

44:09.893 --> 44:13.730
So just crowd right in!
Just crowd right in!

44:15.799 --> 44:17.100
Excuse me for a moment.

44:22.739 --> 44:26.877
Well?
Is she gonna help us
out or not? Yes or no?

44:26.877 --> 44:29.012
No!
It's too dangerous.

44:29.012 --> 44:32.015
Well, we need new stunts.
Where's the hell is this
outside loop of yours?

44:32.015 --> 44:33.950
The plane'll be ready
by the Muncie fair.

44:33.950 --> 44:36.386
That's several
weeks from now.
We could starve by then.

44:36.386 --> 44:38.721
We need something
to bide us through.

44:42.525 --> 44:44.928
Duke, I'm going
to make you legendary.

44:44.928 --> 44:46.763
I've been legendary
all month, Doc.

44:46.763 --> 44:48.832
All right, then
I'll make you
unprecedented.

44:48.832 --> 44:50.433
I could go
roller skating
on the wing.

44:50.433 --> 44:52.435
It's no good.
Gates done that
this season.

44:52.435 --> 44:54.337
Okay, Doc. How about
if I parachute off

44:54.337 --> 44:55.638
and then play
the harmonica
on the way down.

44:55.638 --> 44:58.108
It's no good.
Gates done that, too,
and he tuted a flute.

44:58.108 --> 45:00.977
What the hell
do you want, Doc?
Sex!

45:02.412 --> 45:04.948
That's what's gonna
pull us through.

45:11.922 --> 45:13.423
Well, I am all
the time saying

45:13.423 --> 45:14.958
how I just
crave adventure.

45:15.792 --> 45:17.160
Then it's yes?

45:17.160 --> 45:18.795
Honey, don't let
him bully you

45:18.795 --> 45:19.896
into doing something
you don't want to do.

45:19.896 --> 45:21.898
Oh, she's gonna do it!
She's gonna pull us through.

45:21.898 --> 45:23.800
All right now,
here's what we do.

45:23.800 --> 45:26.336
We put her up on the wing...
Yeah. And she'll fake
bein' afraid.

45:26.336 --> 45:28.471
Right.
And the wind will blow
her clothes off.

45:28.471 --> 45:30.140
Yeah. Yeah.

45:30.140 --> 45:31.875
Wait. Why would
the wind blow
her clothes off?

45:31.875 --> 45:34.077
When I'm wing-walking,
the wind doesn't blow
my clothes off.

45:34.077 --> 45:36.980
Nobody wants to see you
with your clothes off!

45:36.980 --> 45:40.483
Her, they'll come runnin'
to see what happens,
if you know what I mean.

45:40.483 --> 45:41.818
A good gimmick!

45:41.818 --> 45:46.389
We'll just shred
her clothes beforehand,
and you're a good girl.

45:50.093 --> 45:52.428
I get to pick the clothes.

45:53.529 --> 45:54.898
What was that, honey?

45:54.898 --> 45:58.835
And I get to pick
what words you're gonna
use about me on the sign.

45:58.835 --> 46:01.204
I want my name
higher than
anybody else's

46:01.204 --> 46:03.439
and I want my name
bigger than anybody's.

46:03.439 --> 46:06.009
Let's see. I want
to be the "It" girl
of the skies!

46:06.009 --> 46:07.944
That's what I'll be.

46:07.944 --> 46:09.980
No, no, that
isn't so good.
Stop her, Doc.

46:09.980 --> 46:12.548
Nobody's gonna
stop me, Buster Brown!

46:14.885 --> 46:17.888
Now, this is what
you're gonna write.

46:18.454 --> 46:19.923
Now!

46:22.959 --> 46:23.994
I want it higher
than anybody's

46:23.994 --> 46:26.529
and bigger than anybody
else's name on the sign.

46:26.529 --> 46:30.033
Go ahead.
Fabulous. Fantastic.
Mary Beth Mclllhermy,

46:30.033 --> 46:32.135
the "it" girl
of the skies.

46:44.981 --> 46:48.018
All right. All right!

47:34.497 --> 47:35.631
Okay!

47:47.944 --> 47:49.679
Now, honey, now!

47:50.947 --> 47:52.215
Help me!

47:52.215 --> 47:54.951
Somebody, help me, please!

47:54.951 --> 47:58.488
Please, help me!
Somebody, please help me!

47:58.488 --> 48:04.160
Help me! Oh, God!
Somebody, help me!
Please, help me!

48:04.160 --> 48:06.529
Help me, somebody!
Please! Help me!

48:07.163 --> 48:09.265
Oh, my God!
Axel! Axel!

48:30.653 --> 48:32.722
They're coming out!

48:33.289 --> 48:35.158
Terrific, honey!

48:37.627 --> 48:39.229
You can come back now!

48:44.767 --> 48:46.636
Okay, come back now!

48:51.007 --> 48:54.677
You don't want to go
and freeze on me, do you?

48:54.677 --> 48:57.580
Come on in before
you catch a cold!

48:57.580 --> 48:59.115
Mary Beth!

49:03.686 --> 49:05.388
This is work
to get it up.

49:08.024 --> 49:09.659
Hey, they're coming back.

49:11.294 --> 49:14.197
Hey, what the hell's
he trying to do?

49:14.197 --> 49:16.232
He can't land
with her out there.
He'll cartwheel.

49:32.048 --> 49:34.317
She's frozen.
Come on!

49:34.317 --> 49:36.619
I knew she wasn't
worth top billing.

49:36.619 --> 49:37.753
Move!

49:41.724 --> 49:44.094
Contact.
Contact.

49:56.172 --> 49:59.175
What are they doin'?
How the hell do I know
what they're doin'?

49:59.175 --> 50:01.111
They don't know
what they're doing!

50:06.349 --> 50:09.352
We're both gonna die
if you stay out there!

50:11.187 --> 50:13.289
Please,

50:13.289 --> 50:16.459
crawl to the centre
and get out of there!

50:19.095 --> 50:20.396
Mary Beth!

51:15.351 --> 51:16.519
Jesus!

53:09.965 --> 53:11.534
I'm going across.

53:11.534 --> 53:15.271
I can't keep it level
with both of you out there.

53:15.271 --> 53:16.806
Put it into
a shallow dive.

53:16.806 --> 53:17.973
Okay.

53:41.397 --> 53:45.601
Mary Beth,
I'm gonna help you.

53:48.538 --> 53:49.872
Here, take my hand.

53:51.307 --> 53:53.543
I'm gonna help you
back, Mary Beth.

53:54.310 --> 53:55.578
Take my hand!

53:56.312 --> 53:57.347
Mary Beth!

53:59.549 --> 54:01.384
Take it! Take my hand!

54:03.018 --> 54:04.320
No!

54:26.342 --> 54:27.510
Jesus!

54:29.111 --> 54:30.480
You'll notify her family?

54:30.480 --> 54:32.014
Oh, yes, sir.
We know exactly
what to do.

54:32.014 --> 54:33.983
Don't worry about that.

54:33.983 --> 54:37.520
Ah, I hate to say this,
but I am in the business,

54:37.520 --> 54:40.556
and an accident
like this does
bring the people out,

54:40.556 --> 54:41.957
so if you'll
just excuse us.

54:41.957 --> 54:44.927
Nobody's goin' no place
unless he says so.

54:47.963 --> 54:49.699
Unless who says so?

55:03.446 --> 55:05.080
I almost had her.

55:06.982 --> 55:09.685
Jesus,
I came so close.

55:12.988 --> 55:14.424
In here.

55:27.069 --> 55:28.971
Hey, Newt.

55:28.971 --> 55:30.506
Hey, hotshot,
how are ya?

55:30.506 --> 55:32.107
What do you say?

55:33.075 --> 55:34.944
Gee...

55:34.944 --> 55:38.981
Newt, this is Doc Dillhoefer
and my partner, Axel Olsson.

55:38.981 --> 55:41.617
Hey, you guys,
this is Newton Potts.

55:41.617 --> 55:45.120
He was my squadron
leader in France.

55:45.120 --> 55:47.557
What are you doin' here?
You know, he got
11 planes, Doc?

55:47.557 --> 55:49.425
Oh, I've heard a lot
about Mr. Potts.

55:49.425 --> 55:51.627
What brings you
down here?

55:51.627 --> 55:53.696
You do, Mr. Dillhoefer.

55:53.696 --> 55:56.699
I'm the Regional Air
Inspector here for the
Department of Commerce.

55:56.699 --> 55:58.968
I'm afraid I'm going to
have to shut you down.

55:58.968 --> 56:00.035
What?

56:00.035 --> 56:01.537
On who the
hell's authority?

56:01.537 --> 56:03.172
The Air Commerce Act.

56:03.172 --> 56:07.710
Your air circus is operating
in direct violation of the
civil aeronautics code.

56:07.710 --> 56:10.446
Hey, come off it, Newt.
What are you talk...
What is all this?

56:10.446 --> 56:13.015
The fun and games
are over, Waldo.

56:13.015 --> 56:15.518
You guys been scarin'
the hell out of people
for too long.

56:15.518 --> 56:18.554
Flying is getting to be
big business, and people
gotta figure it's safe.

56:18.554 --> 56:23.493
You can't wave your
papers and ruin our
livelihood just like that.

56:23.493 --> 56:26.028
You meet the
requirements in here
and you can fly again.

56:26.028 --> 56:29.465
But your planes have
to be licensed,
your pilots licensed.

56:29.465 --> 56:33.135
No stunting over
congested areas,
no wing-walking.

56:33.135 --> 56:35.605
It's all in there.

56:35.605 --> 56:38.140
When you're ready
for inspection, let me
know and I'll come back.

56:38.140 --> 56:39.642
But until then,
you're grounded.

56:41.243 --> 56:44.714
Gee, do you think
if I study real hard,
Newt, I might pass?

56:47.116 --> 56:50.753
Are you gonna license
the clouds and the rain?

56:50.753 --> 56:53.155
You gonna put
highways in the sky
for people to follow?

56:53.155 --> 56:55.691
Yep. All that, too.

56:55.691 --> 56:57.226
Along with airlines
and airmail,

56:57.226 --> 56:59.595
and there's gonna
be big money in it
too, if you're smart.

56:59.595 --> 57:02.532
Well, I'm no chauffeur,
and I'm no mailman.

57:04.099 --> 57:05.501
I'm a flyer, Newt.

57:05.501 --> 57:06.936
I'm afraid not
anymore, Waldo.

57:06.936 --> 57:10.540
Not until an investigation
has been held into
the death of that girl.

57:10.540 --> 57:12.708
Waldo and Axel
wanted to save her!

57:12.708 --> 57:14.744
Then that will
come out in
the investigation,

57:14.744 --> 57:19.615
but until then,
everybody involved
will not be issued licences.

57:19.615 --> 57:21.216
And when is
that gonna be?

57:21.216 --> 57:23.819
The Regional Board
convenes in
Wichita in six weeks.

57:23.819 --> 57:26.622
Now listen, I've got
a contract with the
Muncie Fair in two weeks.

57:26.622 --> 57:28.658
I need Waldo
and Axel to fly!

57:28.658 --> 57:30.092
You can't
do this to me!

57:30.092 --> 57:31.627
I've got nothin'
to do with it.

57:31.627 --> 57:33.796
It's Congress
and you guys.

57:35.164 --> 57:37.099
You done it
to yourselves.

57:39.769 --> 57:41.837
Why don't you
all grow up?

57:47.543 --> 57:51.747
Waldo, you're the
greatest natural flyer
I've ever seen in my life.

57:51.747 --> 57:54.817
If the war had gone on a
little longer, you might have
proved that to everybody.

57:54.817 --> 57:57.853
But that kind
of flying is finished.

57:57.853 --> 58:00.255
You'll have to
learn to live with it.

58:01.290 --> 58:03.759
I'm sorry, hotshot.

58:03.759 --> 58:06.228
Dillhoefer,
I'll be in touch.

58:16.171 --> 58:19.108
I just don't understand.

58:19.108 --> 58:21.944
That guy was
a great squadron leader.

58:21.944 --> 58:24.814
What the hell
happens to people?

58:24.814 --> 58:26.281
Kid stuff.

58:27.216 --> 58:28.851
What does it say?

58:29.685 --> 58:30.920
Not this.

58:31.854 --> 58:34.156
Us.

58:34.156 --> 58:35.958
What we've been doin'.

58:37.793 --> 58:41.263
Waldo, he's right.
It's kid's stuff.

58:41.263 --> 58:43.298
Now, come on.
We can still fly
the Muncie fair.

58:43.298 --> 58:45.968
Now, don't worry about Newt.
He's an old pal.
He'll come around.

58:46.836 --> 58:48.270
I'm through, Waldo.

58:51.607 --> 58:52.842
My heart isn't in it.

58:56.746 --> 58:58.313
See you.

58:58.313 --> 58:59.915
You take care.

59:04.954 --> 59:07.990
Come on!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:00:06.415 --> 01:00:08.984
Do I fly?
Or am I finished?

01:00:10.019 --> 01:00:11.954
Neither. I fly.

01:00:13.889 --> 01:00:17.259
Look, Waldo,
Newt said you'd already
asked him three times.

01:00:17.259 --> 01:00:19.795
He can't let you.

01:00:19.795 --> 01:00:23.298
Somebody's gonna
do the outside loop
any day now.

01:00:23.298 --> 01:00:27.369
If I can do it here,
now, you'll still
have the plane later on.

01:00:27.369 --> 01:00:29.739
He says you might be able
to get away with two
months suspension.

01:00:29.739 --> 01:00:31.874
You can take it to
exhibitions all
over the country.

01:00:31.874 --> 01:00:34.009
You can follow Kessler
around and show him up.

01:00:35.310 --> 01:00:37.046
All I did was try
and save her.

01:00:37.046 --> 01:00:38.480
I know.

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:42.752
Newt's gotta go by the rules.
Half the local CAA
is sittin' out there.

01:00:43.385 --> 01:00:44.854
CAA!

01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:51.894
Waldo,

01:00:51.894 --> 01:00:54.263
we've been together
all our lives.

01:00:54.263 --> 01:00:55.464
Tell me to fly it
and I'll fly it.

01:00:55.464 --> 01:00:57.767
Tell me to skip it
and I'll skip it.

01:00:58.300 --> 01:00:59.902
But I gotta know now.

01:01:07.076 --> 01:01:08.944
Are you ready?

01:01:08.944 --> 01:01:10.880
Yes!

01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:14.083
Are you sure you're ready?

01:01:14.083 --> 01:01:16.051
Yes!

01:01:17.887 --> 01:01:20.756
Down from the heavens,

01:01:20.756 --> 01:01:22.524
all for you,

01:01:22.524 --> 01:01:24.894
the Stiles Skystreak!

01:01:39.441 --> 01:01:44.079
Ladies and gentlemen,
for the first time

01:01:44.079 --> 01:01:47.382
in the history of aviation,

01:01:47.382 --> 01:01:49.051
the most difficult,

01:01:50.319 --> 01:01:53.355
the most dangerous

01:01:53.355 --> 01:01:58.828
aerobatic maneuver
ever performed
in the entire world.

01:01:58.828 --> 01:02:02.431
Mr. Ezra Stiles
will now perform

01:02:02.431 --> 01:02:04.533
the outside loop!

01:02:11.941 --> 01:02:13.843
He's over the
top now folks,

01:02:13.843 --> 01:02:16.478
and into his dive
at 200 miles an hour.

01:02:16.478 --> 01:02:19.181
He's coming out
of the dive upside down

01:02:19.181 --> 01:02:23.485
and centrifugal force
is trying to throw him
out of the cockpit.

01:02:23.485 --> 01:02:26.455
Put the power on.
Power on! Late!

01:02:26.455 --> 01:02:29.959
Tremendous
pressure's are driving
the blood to his head.

01:02:29.959 --> 01:02:32.127
He could black out
any second.

01:02:32.127 --> 01:02:36.465
Oh, he's trying to push
over the top and make
history here for you, today.

01:02:47.409 --> 01:02:50.212
It's all right folks.
He's under control.

01:02:57.586 --> 01:02:59.421
He's not gonna
make it, is he?

01:02:59.421 --> 01:03:01.590
He'll make it.

01:03:01.590 --> 01:03:05.460
Well, if he don't
we'll go right into the
opera singer routine.

01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:06.962
Duke, get into
the opera costume.

01:03:06.962 --> 01:03:08.530
He'll make it.

01:03:08.530 --> 01:03:10.132
Get the plane ready.

01:03:40.162 --> 01:03:42.631
Don't let
it hang there.

01:04:09.291 --> 01:04:10.926
Piece of cake, Ezra!

01:04:24.473 --> 01:04:25.640
Pull back. That's it!

01:04:35.017 --> 01:04:36.285
Now power! Now power!

01:04:40.055 --> 01:04:41.957
Don't let it slide back.

01:04:41.957 --> 01:04:44.159
Jesus, don't let
it slide back!

01:05:15.757 --> 01:05:17.559
Go back! Go back!

01:05:21.763 --> 01:05:26.035
Ace, get that goddamn
plane started! Go back!

01:05:31.673 --> 01:05:34.109
Listen. Let me...

01:05:34.109 --> 01:05:36.045
Let me get the belt.

01:05:38.547 --> 01:05:41.383
Can you move your legs?
Can you move your legs?

01:05:41.383 --> 01:05:43.318
Not much.
Well, try.

01:05:44.219 --> 01:05:46.055
They're jammed.

01:05:47.022 --> 01:05:48.023
Son of a bitch!

01:05:48.023 --> 01:05:50.025
Hey, one of you guys
give me a hand, will ya?

01:05:50.025 --> 01:05:54.129
Oh, Christ! Waldo!
They're smoking!
They're smoking!

01:05:54.129 --> 01:05:56.065
Hey!
Put that away,
goddamn it!

01:05:56.065 --> 01:05:58.033
Put those
cigarettes away!

01:05:58.033 --> 01:06:00.402
Get 'em away
from the plane!
Damn it!

01:06:00.402 --> 01:06:02.037
Get 'em away!

01:06:02.037 --> 01:06:04.706
Fire! Fire!

01:06:04.706 --> 01:06:07.242
Don't let me
burn, Waldo!

01:06:07.242 --> 01:06:08.743
Somebody give me
a hand. Quick!

01:06:08.743 --> 01:06:09.778
Please! Help me!

01:06:09.778 --> 01:06:12.181
Come on, help me.
Don't just stand there.

01:06:12.181 --> 01:06:14.049
Help me!
Help me get him out!

01:06:14.049 --> 01:06:16.285
Don't let me burn!

01:06:16.285 --> 01:06:18.287
Don't let me burn!

01:06:18.287 --> 01:06:22.057
Waldo!
Waldo, I'm burning!
I'm burning!

01:06:23.425 --> 01:06:24.726
Waldo!

01:06:30.332 --> 01:06:31.733
Get away!

01:06:31.733 --> 01:06:35.604
Get away from here,
you goddamn vultures!

01:06:35.604 --> 01:06:37.606
Get away. Go back!

01:06:37.606 --> 01:06:40.242
Go back!
Go on! Get away!

01:07:10.772 --> 01:07:12.274
Get away!

01:07:18.780 --> 01:07:20.149
What the hell
is he doin'?

01:07:27.156 --> 01:07:28.490
Get away!

01:09:00.482 --> 01:09:03.785
It's permanent, Waldo.

01:09:03.785 --> 01:09:07.188
The Regional Board
met in Wichita.
Permanently grounded.

01:09:10.225 --> 01:09:13.228
It's a federal offense
if you ever fly again.

01:09:13.228 --> 01:09:14.828
That means jail.

01:09:18.367 --> 01:09:19.868
I put in my
pitch for you.

01:09:19.868 --> 01:09:22.504
Did everything I could,
but they wouldn't budge.

01:09:22.504 --> 01:09:24.506
It's a miracle
no one was killed
in that crash.

01:09:24.506 --> 01:09:28.410
If there had been,
you'd of been up
for manslaughter.

01:09:31.011 --> 01:09:35.484
As it was,
they figure they're
letting you off easy.

01:09:37.519 --> 01:09:40.555
Well, they did
the right thing.

01:09:42.357 --> 01:09:44.225
There's no doubt about it.

01:09:51.265 --> 01:09:53.568
You can come work
for me if you want to.

01:09:53.568 --> 01:09:55.470
It's the best
I can do.

01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:57.306
It's clerkin', sure,
but you'd still
be in aviation.

01:10:05.814 --> 01:10:07.516
No, thanks, Newt.

01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:09.584
Thanks, but no thanks.

01:10:12.987 --> 01:10:15.557
Well, if you
change your mind,
let me know.

01:10:23.665 --> 01:10:26.267
What do you think
about Kessler?

01:10:27.502 --> 01:10:29.638
What?

01:10:29.638 --> 01:10:32.474
Doin' the outside loop,
last week, in St. Louis.

01:10:39.481 --> 01:10:41.049
Well,

01:10:42.551 --> 01:10:45.587
somebody was
bound to do it
sooner or later.

01:10:48.490 --> 01:10:50.359
Yeah, I suppose so.

01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:55.364
Take it easy, hotshot.

01:10:55.364 --> 01:10:56.598
Yeah.

01:11:08.477 --> 01:11:09.578
Hey.

01:11:16.718 --> 01:11:18.653
Who is it?

01:11:18.653 --> 01:11:21.523
It's me, Doc.
Waldo Pepper.

01:11:26.495 --> 01:11:27.729
Goodbye!

01:11:28.663 --> 01:11:31.500
Just a minute, huh, Doc?

01:11:50.018 --> 01:11:51.520
Howdy, Doc.

01:11:56.057 --> 01:12:00.094
Oh, hey, you're
lookin' good, Doc.
Real good.

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.163
What you been doin'?

01:12:02.163 --> 01:12:03.965
Get to it, Pepper.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.436
Oh, nothing, I...

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:12.474
Well, I'm healing
pretty fast,

01:12:12.474 --> 01:12:16.511
and I was thinkin'
about maybe gettin'
back into flying.

01:12:16.511 --> 01:12:18.079
I can't advise
you on that.

01:12:18.079 --> 01:12:19.514
You wanna go
to jail, go to jail.

01:12:19.514 --> 01:12:22.016
I'd use another
name, of course.

01:12:22.016 --> 01:12:24.453
I wouldn't want star
billin' or anything.

01:12:25.687 --> 01:12:26.988
With me?

01:12:26.988 --> 01:12:30.091
You get me the worst
publicity that a man
could ever ask for,

01:12:30.091 --> 01:12:32.093
you get me
suspended for a year,

01:12:32.093 --> 01:12:34.529
and here you are now,
asking me for a job.

01:12:34.529 --> 01:12:36.030
Come on, Doc.

01:12:37.699 --> 01:12:39.434
You're crazy.

01:12:41.536 --> 01:12:44.806
There's not an outfit
in this part of the country
that'll even touch you.

01:12:48.710 --> 01:12:51.613
Ah, it's all
gone anyway.

01:12:53.014 --> 01:12:55.450
They don't wanna see
stuntin' anymore.

01:12:55.450 --> 01:12:58.987
They want speed,
records, fast, faster.

01:12:58.987 --> 01:13:01.623
Get yourself a bug,
hit 200, you're home free.

01:13:03.725 --> 01:13:05.026
I can do that.

01:13:10.532 --> 01:13:11.633
Goodbye, Pepper.

01:13:11.633 --> 01:13:14.703
Your friend Olsson's doin'
pretty good in Hollywood.

01:13:14.703 --> 01:13:18.473
Maybe the CAA
hasn't set itself
up in the west yet.

01:13:18.473 --> 01:13:19.841
Try California.

01:13:21.075 --> 01:13:22.611
CAA.

01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.848
See you, Doc.

01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:30.652
You're not a
bad sort, Waldo.

01:13:30.652 --> 01:13:32.587
But you're dangerous.

01:14:00.715 --> 01:14:02.250
How's the pay?

01:14:02.250 --> 01:14:03.585
Good.

01:14:05.186 --> 01:14:07.288
The people are
kind of nutty but you
get used to them.

01:14:07.288 --> 01:14:10.258
I haven't been
out of work
since I got here.

01:14:10.258 --> 01:14:12.594
Who do I see
about getting a job?

01:14:12.594 --> 01:14:13.828
Don't worry about it.

01:14:16.565 --> 01:14:19.267
Finish! Cut!
Axel, move in.
Come on, Axel.

01:14:20.068 --> 01:14:22.103
I'll be right back.

01:14:22.103 --> 01:14:24.673
Now, you'll be in that
position over there.

01:14:24.673 --> 01:14:26.841
All right, gentlemen.

01:14:26.841 --> 01:14:29.210
All right.
Stand by, everybody!

01:14:29.210 --> 01:14:30.645
Roll 'em!

01:14:32.213 --> 01:14:33.648
Speed.

01:14:34.749 --> 01:14:36.150
Action.

01:14:40.922 --> 01:14:43.257
Cut! Did you got that?

01:14:43.257 --> 01:14:44.859
Okay for you?

01:14:44.859 --> 01:14:47.295
Okay, Joe? Good.

01:15:02.711 --> 01:15:05.113
Cut! Print!
That was a good one.

01:15:05.113 --> 01:15:07.716
Let's just wait
a minute, Frank.
Just a minute.

01:15:09.618 --> 01:15:12.721
I am just too cat-like
to fall that way.

01:15:12.721 --> 01:15:15.289
Every fan I have will
know in his heart
it simply isn't me.

01:15:15.289 --> 01:15:17.258
I have too much
natural grace.

01:15:17.258 --> 01:15:19.828
Couldn't he club me
with a wrench or
somethin' like that?

01:15:19.828 --> 01:15:21.362
You know,
my reflexes are...

01:15:21.362 --> 01:15:24.666
Hey, you were great.
That's a terrific fall. Okay?

01:15:24.666 --> 01:15:28.870
One more time, please.
And Axel, will you use
the gun butt on him this time.

01:15:28.870 --> 01:15:32.674
Props, will you move the
debris out of the way so the
men can bring the table in.

01:15:37.178 --> 01:15:38.613
Well, you must be
the famous Patsy.

01:15:38.613 --> 01:15:40.281
Mmm-hmm.

01:15:40.281 --> 01:15:41.215
Axel says I'm
supposed to be
real nice to you.

01:15:41.215 --> 01:15:42.751
You're damned right.

01:15:42.751 --> 01:15:44.318
Hi, honey.
Hi.

01:15:48.356 --> 01:15:50.859
Werfel asked me
to give you a message.

01:15:50.859 --> 01:15:53.294
He wants you
to reconsider.

01:15:53.294 --> 01:15:55.764
But I thought he
had all his pilots.

01:15:55.764 --> 01:15:57.799
Not after this morning.

01:15:58.266 --> 01:15:59.901
Another mid-air?

01:16:01.770 --> 01:16:04.673
We've been
through that before.
Tell him no.

01:16:04.673 --> 01:16:06.941
I'm glad.
I already did.

01:16:10.211 --> 01:16:12.914
Hey, let's us do it.

01:16:12.914 --> 01:16:15.383
You're talking to
an airline pilot, son.

01:16:15.383 --> 01:16:17.786
Western promised
me an opening at the
end of the month,

01:16:17.786 --> 01:16:20.221
once my application
passes CAA review.

01:16:20.221 --> 01:16:21.656
Ah, who'd approve you?

01:16:21.656 --> 01:16:24.659
I'm clean.
I took my
year's suspension.

01:16:24.659 --> 01:16:26.861
You really wanna
get thrown
to the lions?

01:16:26.861 --> 01:16:30.231
It's a lot better
than getting
creamed by Fokker.

01:16:30.231 --> 01:16:33.434
I can't do that kind
of air work anymore,
anyhow. I'm out of practice.

01:16:33.434 --> 01:16:35.970
But we can work
our way back.

01:16:35.970 --> 01:16:38.372
I couldn't get
the job myself,
but Werfel knows you.

01:16:38.372 --> 01:16:40.341
You could
vouch for me.

01:16:40.341 --> 01:16:42.711
I'd even use
an assumed name.

01:16:43.411 --> 01:16:44.979
How about it?

01:16:49.951 --> 01:16:51.953
Do you think we could?

01:16:57.959 --> 01:17:01.429
God knows Werfel
pays his pilots big.

01:17:01.429 --> 01:17:03.965
All their next of kin
agree on that.

01:17:08.970 --> 01:17:12.741
These are the outtakes
on that scene where Dick
had that piece of bad luck.

01:17:20.949 --> 01:17:23.918
Oh, Dick's gonna be
all right, more or
less, thank God.

01:17:23.918 --> 01:17:25.253
And thank God we had
two cameras on it.

01:17:25.253 --> 01:17:27.889
We got it from different
angles, I think we can
use the same one for

01:17:27.889 --> 01:17:30.892
both Curtin's crash
and Landis's.

01:17:30.892 --> 01:17:34.028
I'm positive the
audience will never notice
they're the same crash.

01:17:36.998 --> 01:17:39.500
Ah, that's supposed
to be Madden's plane
flying over, but I think

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.269
we'll probably
cut that part out.

01:17:41.269 --> 01:17:44.038
And start him going up
again to help McKinnon.

01:17:44.038 --> 01:17:47.441
Oh, here's the same crash
from a different angle.
You'll see what I mean.

01:17:49.878 --> 01:17:52.413
Actually, Dick was lucky
to get out of it alive.

01:17:52.413 --> 01:17:56.017
He'll be in the hospital
for at least a couple
of months, and no use to us.

01:17:58.319 --> 01:18:00.121
All right, that's enough.
Let's have some
lights, please.

01:18:51.105 --> 01:18:52.807
Now then, we've shot
everything up to where

01:18:52.807 --> 01:18:54.308
Madden comes back
up to help McKinnon.

01:18:54.308 --> 01:18:58.046
And what I want to see
is McKinnon's plane flamed,
see him Jump to his death

01:18:58.046 --> 01:19:00.481
and then the final
dog-fight between
Kessler and Madden.

01:19:00.481 --> 01:19:02.516
Think you can handle that?
Yes, sir.
No problem.

01:19:02.516 --> 01:19:04.552
Hey, George.
George. Mr. Werfel,

01:19:04.552 --> 01:19:06.487
I'd like you to
meet my partner,

01:19:06.487 --> 01:19:08.857
the famous George Brown
from the East Coast.

01:19:08.857 --> 01:19:10.091
This is Mr. Werfel,
the Director.

01:19:10.091 --> 01:19:12.126
Excuse me.
What is this picture?

01:19:12.126 --> 01:19:14.528
It's called
Eagles Over France,
about the 14th Air Scouts.

01:19:14.528 --> 01:19:15.830
That was Ernst
Kessler's battle.

01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:18.499
Yes, that's right.
Yes, they flew against
Kessler. It's all true.

01:19:18.499 --> 01:19:20.068
True, no.
You got it all wrong.

01:19:20.068 --> 01:19:23.437
The 14th Scouts didn't have
any Spads, and they didn't
have Newports, or SC 5's.

01:19:23.437 --> 01:19:24.705
Mr. Brown.
There was a
different insignia...

01:19:24.705 --> 01:19:28.476
Mr. Brown! Anybody can
supply accuracy,
artists provide truths.

01:19:29.410 --> 01:19:31.479
But Mr. Werfel,
I know this battle.

01:19:31.479 --> 01:19:33.181
And they were
stationed much closer
to the front line.

01:19:33.181 --> 01:19:34.916
There was no
phony farm house.

01:19:34.916 --> 01:19:38.152
He's quite right,
it didn't look like that.

01:19:38.152 --> 01:19:42.590
But then, perhaps,
some poetic license
is justified.

01:19:42.590 --> 01:19:44.392
You're learning.

01:19:44.392 --> 01:19:46.160
Look here.
You sure you can handle
all these three stunts?

01:19:46.160 --> 01:19:48.396
Yes, Sir.
They're very dangerous.

01:19:48.396 --> 01:19:50.531
We can do it.
And how much is it
gonna cost me?

01:19:50.531 --> 01:19:52.133
Depends.
I'm on a very
tight budget...

01:19:54.635 --> 01:19:56.170
You're Ernst Kessler,
aren't you?

01:19:56.170 --> 01:19:57.538
Yes.

01:19:57.538 --> 01:19:58.973
And your name is Brown?

01:20:02.576 --> 01:20:05.914
I'm sorry I went on
about what an expert
I was on your battle.

01:20:05.914 --> 01:20:09.583
No. No need.
You probably know
more about it than I do.

01:20:09.583 --> 01:20:13.521
I was there, of course,
but ah, there wasn't much
time for me to study.

01:20:17.558 --> 01:20:19.427
Well, anyway,
I'm glad to be
in your movie.

01:20:19.427 --> 01:20:21.462
Oh, it's hardly mine.

01:20:21.462 --> 01:20:24.465
I am just
a technical advisor.

01:20:24.465 --> 01:20:26.567
They let me do
my own flying.

01:20:26.567 --> 01:20:28.569
Publicity, I suppose.

01:20:28.569 --> 01:20:30.204
Aren't you
playing yourself?

01:20:41.916 --> 01:20:44.919
Ernst Kessler
shot down 70 planes.

01:20:46.587 --> 01:20:50.024
Now, if you were
casting the part,
who would you pick?

01:20:50.024 --> 01:20:51.259
I'd pick you.

01:20:53.261 --> 01:20:55.496
Oh, it doesn't matter.

01:20:55.496 --> 01:20:59.267
It's all lies
anyway, Mr. Brown.

01:20:59.267 --> 01:21:02.203
Oh, ah, let's
forget the Brown stuff.

01:21:02.203 --> 01:21:03.537
My name is
Waldo Pepper.

01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:07.675
You're Waldo Pepper?

01:21:10.044 --> 01:21:12.513
You were a friend
of Ezra Stiles?

01:21:12.513 --> 01:21:16.684
And you were with him
in Muncie, when he
tried for the outside loop?

01:21:17.986 --> 01:21:20.955
You were in
some trouble, yes?

01:21:20.955 --> 01:21:22.590
Yes.
It's over now?

01:21:25.226 --> 01:21:26.327
No.

01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:31.065
So nice to
have met you.

01:21:37.038 --> 01:21:39.107
Perhaps we'll have
a chance to fly together.

01:21:40.674 --> 01:21:42.276
I'd like that.

01:21:44.645 --> 01:21:46.347
Goodbye, Mr. Brown.

01:21:47.115 --> 01:21:48.349
Goodbye.

01:21:54.255 --> 01:21:56.090
This is it.

01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:57.358
Uh-huh.

01:22:01.129 --> 01:22:06.200
Well, have you got any notions
of how to set this Goddamned
thing on fire in mid-air

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:08.769
and then jump clear
without singeing
your ass off?

01:22:08.769 --> 01:22:10.571
Well, we'll see.

01:22:11.539 --> 01:22:12.840
Well, you know,
we could...

01:22:12.840 --> 01:22:15.576
Did you find out
how much Werfel is
gonna pay for this stunt?

01:22:15.576 --> 01:22:17.178
Yeah. 500.

01:22:18.379 --> 01:22:20.314
500?

01:22:20.314 --> 01:22:24.318
You mean, he's gonna pay me
$500 just to set this
thing on fire and jump?

01:22:24.318 --> 01:22:27.121
No, not you.
He's paying me $500.

01:22:27.121 --> 01:22:29.390
You're flying
the Madden plane.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:32.326
What?

01:22:32.326 --> 01:22:34.095
You're flying
the Madden plane.

01:22:34.095 --> 01:22:35.229
How do you know?

01:22:35.229 --> 01:22:36.697
Kessler talked
to Werfel.

01:22:36.697 --> 01:22:39.667
He said he wanted to do
the dogfight with you.

01:22:39.667 --> 01:22:45.306
You know,
if I place a charge
under the cowling,

01:22:45.306 --> 01:22:49.710
and I run some wires
back under the floor
board to a switch here,

01:22:49.710 --> 01:22:52.346
when I hit the switch,
smoke pot goes,

01:22:52.346 --> 01:22:54.782
when I jump clear,
the plane will be goin'...

01:23:08.396 --> 01:23:10.231
I was not spying.

01:23:11.232 --> 01:23:13.734
I did not wish
to be an intrusion.

01:23:19.373 --> 01:23:24.712
So, tomorrow we do
the McKinnon jump.
Who's doing it?

01:23:25.813 --> 01:23:26.747
I am.

01:23:26.747 --> 01:23:30.684
May I ask you why?
There are other pilots.

01:23:30.684 --> 01:23:36.390
Well, I'm 32-years-old and
I've been flying since I was
20 and I'm gettin' married.

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.759
Yeah,
I'm gettin' married.

01:23:38.759 --> 01:23:40.661
And they're paying me
500 bucks for this jump

01:23:40.661 --> 01:23:43.331
and that makes my
total net worth $250.

01:23:43.331 --> 01:23:45.133
I need the money.

01:23:48.802 --> 01:23:52.673
Yes, I understand
the need for money.
Captain, believe me.

01:23:54.775 --> 01:24:00.348
I, myself, am in
debt for slightly
less than $40,000.

01:24:00.348 --> 01:24:04.385
But, ah, I still
would not like to

01:24:05.219 --> 01:24:06.787
make that jump.

01:24:06.787 --> 01:24:09.757
Well, how can
a guy like you be
in debt for $40,000?

01:24:11.125 --> 01:24:14.128
I ask myself that
from time to time.

01:24:16.330 --> 01:24:18.499
All I can
tell you is that

01:24:19.833 --> 01:24:23.871
life is clear for me
up there alone.

01:24:25.806 --> 01:24:29.477
In the sky I found,
even in my enemies,

01:24:29.477 --> 01:24:33.181
courage, honor
and chivalry.

01:24:36.417 --> 01:24:38.219
On the ground...

01:24:44.825 --> 01:24:46.360
Is it secured?

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.196
Huh?
Is it secured?

01:24:48.196 --> 01:24:49.230
Yeah.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:51.832
Okay. I'm gonna put the
switch in back here, now.

01:24:51.832 --> 01:24:53.267
Yeah.

01:24:53.267 --> 01:24:55.169
Are you sure?

01:24:55.169 --> 01:24:56.304
Sure about what?

01:24:56.304 --> 01:24:58.272
About... Hey!

01:24:58.272 --> 01:25:01.209
Goddamn it,
you stupid moron!

01:25:01.209 --> 01:25:03.744
This is already
a fire hazard
just sitting here!

01:25:04.712 --> 01:25:07.448
Get me an end wrench.

01:25:07.448 --> 01:25:09.383
Never mind.
I'll get it myself.

01:25:34.275 --> 01:25:36.377
Madden got height
on you that day.

01:25:38.546 --> 01:25:42.216
They were up in back
of you with the sun
behind them. How come?

01:25:42.216 --> 01:25:44.785
Hmm. You're quite correct.

01:25:46.854 --> 01:25:48.889
Yes, I was heading
back home.

01:25:48.889 --> 01:25:51.325
Cold and
I'm afraid, careless.

01:25:53.327 --> 01:25:56.597
You know, I flew
much better missions
than this one.

01:25:57.831 --> 01:26:00.401
Nobody knows about
them, but I did.

01:26:02.570 --> 01:26:04.838
This one only took
eight minutes.

01:26:04.838 --> 01:26:08.442
Someone down
on the ground
told me that once.

01:26:08.442 --> 01:26:10.244
I was surprised.

01:26:11.245 --> 01:26:12.513
You see,

01:26:14.448 --> 01:26:18.786
nothing in my life
has ever been
the same since.

01:26:18.786 --> 01:26:22.290
And eight minutes,
it seemed too little,
like a cheat.

01:26:31.932 --> 01:26:35.303
The five of them
came at us out
of the sun.

01:26:36.370 --> 01:26:38.539
And on the
first pass,

01:26:38.539 --> 01:26:41.475
Madden shot down
my escort plane.

01:26:41.475 --> 01:26:44.278
Which left it four
to one against me.

01:26:46.380 --> 01:26:49.049
At first,
I wanted to run,

01:26:49.049 --> 01:26:52.386
but they had
the angles on me,
so I closed with them.

01:26:53.053 --> 01:26:55.456
And that they
did not expect.

01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:58.258
You know,

01:27:00.494 --> 01:27:02.930
I could see how
young they were.

01:27:03.531 --> 01:27:05.265
So frightened.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:08.636
And they already
knew my plane.

01:27:14.442 --> 01:27:15.943
Who was Lola?

01:27:16.877 --> 01:27:18.512
My first wife.

01:27:20.548 --> 01:27:22.616
You know,
I've had three.

01:27:24.552 --> 01:27:27.888
She left me
soon after the war.

01:27:27.888 --> 01:27:31.325
They all left me,
but Lola is
the only one

01:27:31.325 --> 01:27:33.594
that I still seek
out in crowds.

01:27:40.634 --> 01:27:43.003
Where was I?
They recognized
your plane.

01:27:44.004 --> 01:27:46.674
And they
forgot everything.

01:27:46.674 --> 01:27:49.076
You know, they made
such final mistakes.

01:27:49.076 --> 01:27:52.079
And I kept on firing
until they were down.

01:27:53.914 --> 01:27:56.650
And the last to go
was McKinnon.

01:27:56.650 --> 01:27:58.919
And he flamed.

01:27:58.919 --> 01:28:01.355
You know, I don't
blame him for jumping.

01:28:01.355 --> 01:28:03.023
I would have done
the same thing.

01:28:03.023 --> 01:28:06.093
But I didn't actually
see him go, because
Madden was on me.

01:28:06.093 --> 01:28:07.395
Did you know
it was Madden?

01:28:08.429 --> 01:28:10.097
I think so, yes.

01:28:10.097 --> 01:28:12.533
I wanted it to be,
I know that.

01:28:13.634 --> 01:28:16.404
Madden, they said,
was a wonder.

01:28:16.404 --> 01:28:18.672
And I was
Ernst Kessler.

01:28:20.007 --> 01:28:22.510
But not
against children.

01:28:22.510 --> 01:28:24.545
No, that proves nothing.

01:28:26.947 --> 01:28:28.416
You see,

01:28:29.049 --> 01:28:31.051
I keep track of talent.

01:28:35.389 --> 01:28:37.425
Madden tried
going under you
at first, didn't he?

01:28:38.959 --> 01:28:40.360
Yes.

01:28:41.395 --> 01:28:44.031
Were you surprised?

01:28:44.031 --> 01:28:48.669
I thought I was done.
But I maneuvered free.

01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:53.106
But before I could
breathe, he was on
me again, and I said,

01:28:53.106 --> 01:28:56.076
"My God, is he
better than I am?

01:28:56.076 --> 01:28:58.612
"Is there someone
who can beat me
in the sky?"

01:28:58.612 --> 01:29:00.448
Were you scared?

01:29:00.648 --> 01:29:02.616
No.

01:29:02.616 --> 01:29:04.685
Everything was in order.

01:29:04.685 --> 01:29:06.787
The world made
total sense.

01:29:07.755 --> 01:29:09.657
We battled.

01:29:09.657 --> 01:29:12.460
No lasting advantage.

01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:15.095
He was brighter,
I was smarter.

01:29:15.095 --> 01:29:17.565
He was faster,
and I was quicker.

01:29:17.565 --> 01:29:18.799
Until

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:22.736
he hesitated
coming out of a turn.

01:29:23.604 --> 01:29:25.506
His guns had jammed.

01:29:27.575 --> 01:29:29.643
You know,
I could see him,

01:29:31.445 --> 01:29:36.083
pounding on the guns.
Trying to make them
regain function.

01:29:36.083 --> 01:29:38.752
And I thought,
"Run, Madden.

01:29:39.653 --> 01:29:41.589
"Try for the clouds."

01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:45.025
But he didn't.

01:29:45.025 --> 01:29:48.128
He came straight
for me instead.

01:29:48.128 --> 01:29:51.832
And I thought,
"You are very stupid,

01:29:53.634 --> 01:29:56.069
"but you are very brave.

01:29:56.069 --> 01:29:58.772
"So someone else
will have to kill you."

01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:01.575
Was that when
you saluted?

01:30:04.478 --> 01:30:05.679
Yes.

01:30:07.047 --> 01:30:08.816
And then what did you do?

01:30:11.752 --> 01:30:13.220
Wept.

01:30:19.560 --> 01:30:21.228
Now, when you pull
the smoke pot,
keep it going

01:30:21.228 --> 01:30:24.164
for a full 10 seconds
and then set
the plane on fire.

01:30:24.164 --> 01:30:27.267
Only, make sure the
plane's really on fire
before you get out.

01:30:27.267 --> 01:30:30.504
Now, then you'll jump,
and the camera ship will
follow you all the way down.

01:30:30.504 --> 01:30:31.639
Right? Okay.

01:30:31.639 --> 01:30:33.206
But don't open your
parachute too soon

01:30:33.206 --> 01:30:34.508
otherwise you'll spoil
the whole effect.

01:30:34.508 --> 01:30:38.245
And I don't want to
do this shot again.
Right? Okay. Let's go.

01:30:43.884 --> 01:30:45.786
I suppose you
could not pull
your chute at all,

01:30:45.786 --> 01:30:47.755
that way he'd
be sure to get
the right effect!

01:31:59.927 --> 01:32:01.328
Let's go!

01:32:31.725 --> 01:32:34.227
Get me some
scissors to get
this boot off.

01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.803
Guess who's
still alive? Me!

01:32:56.016 --> 01:32:59.219
That's the one!
We got it.

01:33:00.220 --> 01:33:02.790
We got it. Oops.

01:33:02.790 --> 01:33:06.226
Here we go. Steady.
Steady. Here we go.

01:33:07.695 --> 01:33:09.229
You wanted to be
a movie star.

01:33:09.229 --> 01:33:10.764
Who, me?

01:33:10.764 --> 01:33:13.400
Boy, do I look
forward to this a lot.

01:33:14.968 --> 01:33:16.704
We got it.

01:33:17.838 --> 01:33:19.039
Hold it.

01:33:24.712 --> 01:33:27.948
Who's that?
Is that Newt?

01:33:27.948 --> 01:33:31.952
Hey, hey, hey, Newt!
What you doin'
in California, Newt?

01:33:31.952 --> 01:33:35.255
I'm working,
I'm the regional
head of the CAA now.

01:33:35.255 --> 01:33:37.925
Western sent me
Axel's pilot application.

01:33:37.925 --> 01:33:40.694
I'm down here to check
a few things out.

01:33:40.694 --> 01:33:44.231
Make a few comments
about his character.

01:33:44.231 --> 01:33:47.935
I've a stupendous character.
The world agrees on that!

01:33:47.935 --> 01:33:49.402
Good. Good.

01:33:51.038 --> 01:33:54.274
There any bad habits
I should know about?

01:33:55.242 --> 01:33:56.810
Drinking, for example?

01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:58.278
Oh...

01:33:58.278 --> 01:33:59.947
There's no
problem here.
No.

01:33:59.947 --> 01:34:03.784
Well, I guess if Western's
dumb enough to want you,

01:34:03.784 --> 01:34:06.854
they won't be in business
long enough for you
to do them any harm.

01:34:08.856 --> 01:34:10.323
Did you know
Kessler's in town?

01:34:10.323 --> 01:34:11.391
Huh?

01:34:11.391 --> 01:34:13.393
Kessler is in town.

01:34:13.393 --> 01:34:16.029
They're filming the
Madden dog-fight
for some movie.

01:34:16.029 --> 01:34:21.034
I know. Right. I read
about that In the papers.
Next week or...

01:34:21.034 --> 01:34:23.904
No. It's tomorrow.

01:34:27.007 --> 01:34:29.442
Well, I guess
I got it wrong.

01:34:34.748 --> 01:34:37.417
Hey, you gonna come and
have a drink with us?

01:34:37.417 --> 01:34:40.888
No, thanks.
No, thanks,
but I can't.

01:34:40.888 --> 01:34:42.522
I gotta get up
early tomorrow.

01:34:42.522 --> 01:34:45.392
Betcha every pilot in
town is gonna try and
sneak In on this one.

01:34:45.392 --> 01:34:49.096
I don't know about
you guys, but I wouldn't
miss it for the world.

01:34:50.898 --> 01:34:52.766
Well...

01:34:52.766 --> 01:34:54.334
Hey, we'll see you.

01:34:54.334 --> 01:34:55.836
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:34:55.836 --> 01:34:58.071
See ya, Newt.
Happy landings.
Take good care.

01:35:13.020 --> 01:35:14.788
Do you see him?

01:35:14.788 --> 01:35:17.791
If I saw him,
I'd at least grunt
or something.

01:35:17.791 --> 01:35:20.093
Just keep a
steady lookout.
I don't...

01:35:20.093 --> 01:35:22.095
Werfel's waiting
for you.

01:35:22.095 --> 01:35:23.530
Right!

01:35:33.373 --> 01:35:35.976
Well, what
do you think?

01:35:38.411 --> 01:35:40.047
Hey, Brown!

01:35:40.814 --> 01:35:41.949
Yeah.

01:35:48.856 --> 01:35:52.960
All right. We're gonna start
with some independent passes
over the camera ship.

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.461
He'll signal when
he's got enough.

01:35:54.461 --> 01:35:56.596
Then we'll cut to some
head-on passes.

01:35:56.596 --> 01:36:00.868
But keep close.
Remember at all times,
keep close to the camera ship.

01:36:00.868 --> 01:36:02.836
Look, I know those
are uncomfortable,

01:36:02.836 --> 01:36:05.172
and I know you
didn't really wear
them in the war,

01:36:05.172 --> 01:36:07.007
but there are
two men dead on
this picture already,

01:36:07.007 --> 01:36:09.076
so you'll wear them now.
Any questions?

01:36:46.446 --> 01:36:48.515
What'd they
do that for?

01:38:24.311 --> 01:38:26.079
Who's flying
with Kessler?

01:38:26.079 --> 01:38:27.547
Brown.

01:38:28.315 --> 01:38:29.716
New guy.

01:38:35.288 --> 01:38:37.690
I'll get him when
he gets down.

01:40:21.161 --> 01:40:23.196
I don't understand.
What are they doing?

01:40:23.196 --> 01:40:25.265
They're actually fighting,
for Christ's sake.

01:40:39.446 --> 01:40:42.315
Come on, Waldo,
shake him!

01:40:42.315 --> 01:40:44.151
Well, as long as
he's up there.

01:40:59.399 --> 01:41:00.767
He's gonna run
him into the hill.

01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:28.555
Jesus,
he rammed him!

01:42:41.934 --> 01:42:43.903
Well, get a camera
on them, will you.

01:42:43.903 --> 01:42:45.972
If those stupid bastards
are gonna kill each
other, I want it on film!

01:42:48.575 --> 01:42:50.610
Where the hell
are they?

01:42:54.247 --> 01:42:55.382
There's Waldo.

01:43:05.325 --> 01:43:06.459
Look!

01:44:34.347 --> 01:44:35.715
One more pass
and you got him.
