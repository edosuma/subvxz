which is why
the world felt so real.

body was severed
from the mainframe,

21:00.259 --> 21:02.875
her mind was left
connected somehow.

21:03.554 --> 21:07.888
Yeah, but she'sjust
like a computer program
then, right?

21:08.058 --> 21:09.798
Like, it's
not really her.

21:09.977 --> 21:12.343
I don't know. I mean,
what are we, really?

21:12.521 --> 21:15.888
Our brains are
just hard drives of
actions and memories.

21:16.066 --> 21:21.026
I mean, if you think
she's real, and she thinks
she's real, does it matter?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.318
She has no clue she died.

21:26.744 --> 21:28.575
How do you
tell her that?

21:30.539 --> 21:32.245
But I think she'd want
to hear it from you.

please just shut

who's doing this? Okay.

they're not nuclear.

The bad news is, they're
designed to break apart and
take out multiple targets.

31:30.931 --> 31:31.841
Can we shoot them down?

before taking her swan dive.

how this ends.

We have to prepare
for the worst.

31:42.109 --> 31:44.225
We need to get as
many people as we can
into bomb shelters.

I can fit at least
40 people in my office.

31:46.029 --> 31:47.018

31:47.197 --> 31:49.188
Tell Allison to
prepare for casualties.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.023
Don't we have
some sort of backup
for the EM shield?

has an EM shield
lying around!

you happened to build

an adaptive waveform

32:06.800 --> 32:07.915
I would prefer not.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.254
Well, we can fine-tune
the frequency to
destroy the missile,

32:10.429 --> 32:11.839
but it's still
pretty small scale.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.265
I think we can amplify it
to reach the EM shield's

Now we're talking.

32:15.517 --> 32:18.680
Yeah, but the position
of the field generator
has to be exact.

32:18.854 --> 32:21.391
I mean, stretched this thin,
it's only going to
last for a few seconds.

32:21.565 --> 32:23.101
Time everything properly,
it won't have to.

32:23.275 --> 32:24.685
Yeah, it's a bit
of a Hail Mary,
but it's all we've got.

32:24.860 --> 32:26.771
Jack, all we've got
is 12 minutes.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.901
Well, keep evacuating.
We're going to prove
the computer wrong.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.528
We've got
29 lives to save.

32:30.699 --> 32:32.405
We're going to do
better than a B-plus.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.373
Andy, are
Jenna and Kevin safe?

32:42.544 --> 32:43.909
ANDY ON RADIO:
I personally
delivered them to

32:44.087 --> 32:46.078
the Tesla School's
bomb shelter myself.

32:46.256 --> 32:48.838
My structural analysis
indicates that they
will be quite secure.

32:49.009 --> 32:51.000
Okay, thank you.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.885
Jo, what are you still
doing here? I cleared you
to go to the bunker.

32:54.055 --> 32:56.182
I got three guys
who can't be moved,
so I can't be moved.

32:56.349 --> 32:57.600
What can I do to help?

32:57.767 --> 33:01.806
Um, hold someone's hand.
Jo, listen, there's something
I need to tell you.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.016
I know.
Not now.

33:10.906 --> 33:13.443
How the hell did
they do this before GPS?

33:13.617 --> 33:15.232
Oh, give me that.

33:20.540 --> 33:25.751
Fargo, tell Carter
he has to be exactly
42 degrees, 38 minutes,

33:25.754 --> 33:27.210
Fargo, tell Carter
he has to be exactly
42 degrees, 38 minutes,

33:27.464 --> 33:30.752
12.33 seconds north,
121 degrees,

33:31.426 --> 33:35.135
40 minutes,
55.33 degrees west.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.629
Two feet north.
What?

33:37.807 --> 33:39.263
Two feet north!

33:41.811 --> 33:44.063
Okay!
Okay, uh, six feet
to the left.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.100
(GRUNTS IN FRUSTRATION)

33:46.274 --> 33:47.263
No, no, no, no!
Other left!

33:47.859 --> 33:49.850
Uh, yours or mine?
Yours!

33:50.028 --> 33:51.814
(GRUNTS) Yeah, okay.

33:51.988 --> 33:53.603
(PANTING)

33:54.324 --> 33:55.439
How's that?
FARGO: Stop!

33:55.617 --> 33:59.030
Even if they get it into
position, I mean, we only have
a few seconds of coverage

33:59.204 --> 34:00.284
before the field degrades.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.491
Yeah, well, I guess
that's going to
have to be enough then.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.419
Fargo, we're
cutting it close.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.920
How much time
do we have?

34:15.053 --> 34:16.839
15 seconds.

to be wrong.

Never happier.
(CHUCKLING)

34:52.048 --> 34:53.788
Nice work, Sheriff.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.501
Ah, sure beats a B-plus.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.656
Good to see you
back in your office.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.331
And out of your infirmary.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.411
Jo, uh, listen,

35:30.587 --> 35:31.417
I messed up.

35:32.130 --> 35:36.123
Jack didn't remember that
conversation because he
wasn't the one having it.

35:36.301 --> 35:40.135
It was me.
But I suppose you've
already guessed that.

35:40.805 --> 35:44.548
When he said that
he operated on himself,
I had a feeling.

35:45.685 --> 35:48.176
Allison, how could
you do that to me?

35:48.355 --> 35:50.937
To be fair, when you
came in, I told you
we had swapped again.

35:51.107 --> 35:52.142
I didn't mean to lie.

35:52.317 --> 35:53.602
Yeah, but the moment
I started talking,

35:53.777 --> 35:55.358
you knew that
I didn't understand that.

35:55.528 --> 35:56.938
You could've just said
something more.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.978
I know.
I should have.

36:00.116 --> 36:01.367
It's just,

36:02.661 --> 36:06.153
when I was plugged in,
what I experienced
was so real, Jo.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.579
I had to accept
that you and Jack
were together.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.334
It was crushing,
but it made
sense somehow.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.166
So, when you admitted
that you'd thought
about it, I panicked.

36:15.340 --> 36:18.173
I admitted it
just so we wouldn't
become a thing.

36:18.343 --> 36:21.085
I know, and I know
that it's not rational.

36:23.848 --> 36:26.385
I was wrong for
not saying anything.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.473
I'm so sorry, Jo.
Really.

36:37.362 --> 36:40.650
Oh, yeah. No, lwill.
lwill, lwill.
Yeah, absolutely.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.527
Yeah, I'm glad I did, too.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.484
I love you, too.

36:49.165 --> 36:50.826
That was, uh, Fargo?

36:51.000 --> 36:53.036
Oh, absolutely.
Yeah, right.
No, Grace.

37:00.969 --> 37:01.628
(HENRY LAUGHING)

37:01.803 --> 37:05.671
Well, I was afraid to call
because I thought maybe
she didn't want me to.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.589
Not another
disaster, then?

37:07.767 --> 37:10.349
We're not out of the woods,
but it's a start.

37:12.939 --> 37:15.476
Power is restored.
EM shields are up and

37:15.650 --> 37:19.438
PR is spinning
the missile detonation as
a defense systems test.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.157
So, uh, where's
Doctor Disaster?

37:23.324 --> 37:24.530
Packing up his office.

37:24.701 --> 37:26.157
Strangely calm about it.

37:26.327 --> 37:29.160
Said it seemed like
the logical outcome.

37:29.664 --> 37:30.494
Where's Zane?

37:30.665 --> 37:34.453
I don't know, off somewhere
trying to figure out how to
make my job more difficult.

37:34.627 --> 37:36.538
I wouldn't assume that.

37:36.796 --> 37:40.084
Look, I know he's been
messing with Beverly's
computer of doom.

37:40.258 --> 37:41.714
Because I asked him to.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.921
Do I want to know
what it is that
you two are working on?

37:47.098 --> 37:50.932
As your boss,
I'd rather maintain your
plausible deniability.

37:51.102 --> 37:55.892
But just know,
Zane wasn't being a jerk.

37:56.566 --> 37:58.181
He was doing it
as a friend.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.062
Okay, the
Jarlsberg Fondue.

38:04.240 --> 38:05.616
Right. All right. Hold on.

38:05.784 --> 38:07.820
And you can try this

38:08.411 --> 38:11.574
cocktail sausage with
the spicy mustard.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.913
Okay.
Try it.

38:14.417 --> 38:15.497
Mmm.

38:19.422 --> 38:20.286
It's interesting.

38:20.715 --> 38:21.750
It's savory.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.958
So this party, are we
asking for a disaster?

38:25.637 --> 38:27.719
So, are we leaning
toward a theme?

38:27.889 --> 38:30.972
Apres-ski fondue buffet or
Take-me-out—to-the-bal I park?

38:31.142 --> 38:33.349
I was thinking of something
a little simpler.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.636
CARTER: Yeah,
I'm a big fan of, um,

38:35.814 --> 38:38.556
Jenna's cheese curls
with the bouncy castle.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.689
(LAUGHING)
Actually sounds good.

38:41.402 --> 38:43.188
I'll get right on that.

38:43.738 --> 38:46.104
Or maybe something
just like this.

38:47.575 --> 38:48.564
Yeah.

it's not like me,

but I would, um,
like to make a toast.

38:57.293 --> 39:01.252
I'd like to say
congratulations to
my very best friend

39:02.257 --> 39:05.749
for persuading
a highly intelligent woman
to marry him, anyway.

for the dragon.

so not real.

about everything.

have listened.

let you out of my sight.

here, or am Ijust
