WEBVTT

00:07.113 --> 00:08.826
Charlie.

00:09.851 --> 00:11.083
Hey, Charlie, wake up.

00:11.085 --> 00:13.385
Huh?

00:13.387 --> 00:14.453
Hey, you're awake.

00:14.455 --> 00:16.254
Yeah, alarm's about to go off.

00:21.728 --> 00:23.428
Something on your mind, babe?

00:24.492 --> 00:25.896
Did I ever tell you

00:25.899 --> 00:30.000
that I was a member of the
grade-seven debate team?

00:30.002 --> 00:32.460
I did not know that, no.

00:32.516 --> 00:33.930
Got second at nationals.

00:33.980 --> 00:35.319
I had to drop out. It's a long story.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.158
But I have come up with the best argument

00:37.208 --> 00:39.510
for you removing your tumor immediately.

00:39.512 --> 00:43.081
Okay?

00:43.083 --> 00:45.215
O-kay.

00:45.217 --> 00:47.584
I'm loving the confidence.

00:47.586 --> 00:48.785
- Just hear me out.
- Okay.

00:48.787 --> 00:49.953
You're gonna have this surgery

00:49.955 --> 00:51.921
sometime in the near future, correct?

00:51.923 --> 00:52.999
Correct. Shahir r...

00:53.049 --> 00:54.019
Okay, don't interrupt me.

00:54.069 --> 00:55.555
I've got seven minutes before the bell.

00:55.605 --> 00:56.975
Now, the way I see it,

00:57.296 --> 00:58.562
your only reason for not having this surgery

00:58.564 --> 01:00.475
is for fear of losing
the ghosty thing, right?

01:00.525 --> 01:02.832
You've mentioned that before.

01:02.882 --> 01:05.172
Yes, and you didn't deny it.

01:05.221 --> 01:07.135
Now, the ghosts have been
part of your life for a long time.

01:07.185 --> 01:08.537
Maybe you need to try doing
your job without them.

01:08.539 --> 01:11.074
So my question is,

01:11.076 --> 01:13.676
who are you,
and who do you want to become?

01:15.802 --> 01:19.347
That's the bell.

01:22.151 --> 01:25.286
Any rebuttal?

01:25.288 --> 01:27.689
You're good.

01:34.717 --> 01:36.665
Dr. Stroman, I just wanted
to check up on our patient.

01:36.715 --> 01:37.972
Just heading to see her now.

01:38.022 --> 01:39.386
Great. I'll walk with you.

01:39.436 --> 01:40.979
Has the chemo shrunk her tumor?

01:41.029 --> 01:42.998
We're still waiting on the results
of her latest P.E.T. scan.

01:43.048 --> 01:45.339
But you did send her stuff on to
Dr. Binari at Sacred Mercy?

01:45.389 --> 01:46.743
Alex, you know as well as I do

01:46.793 --> 01:48.782
Dr. Binari has strict
indications for surgery.

01:48.832 --> 01:50.790
Yeah, they're looking for
people who are her2-positive.

01:50.840 --> 01:53.142
Yes, but if her tumor isn't
responding to treatment,

01:53.192 --> 01:55.380
even the great Dr.
Binari won't be able to help her.

01:55.430 --> 01:57.512
You know they're looking
for promising cases.

01:57.562 --> 01:58.572
And hers isn't?

01:58.622 --> 02:00.021
We don't know yet.

02:02.961 --> 02:05.158
Dana, how are we feeling today?

02:05.160 --> 02:07.127
I don't know how you're feeling, John,

02:07.129 --> 02:08.928
but I'm-I'm feeling pretty good.

02:08.930 --> 02:12.397
Yep, definitely well enough
to head up to Muskoka for...

02:12.399 --> 02:14.299
Oy. Come on. This again?

02:14.301 --> 02:18.003
I have finished three cycles of
chemo and been a model patient.

02:18.005 --> 02:21.306
For me, John. I've been good.

02:21.308 --> 02:22.274
Morning.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.542
Morning, sunshine.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.444
Aw, not too sunshiny.

02:26.446 --> 02:29.781
You're immunocompromised.
There's fluid in your lungs.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.349
I'm sorry. Wait a minute. She has pneumonia?

02:32.351 --> 02:33.617
Oh, it's a mild case...

02:33.619 --> 02:36.954
certainly nothing to keep me from this.

02:39.059 --> 02:42.093
"The Muskoka bugle
annual cottage festival"?

02:42.095 --> 02:43.894
It's tonight at the marina.

02:43.896 --> 02:46.930
Old "handcuffy" here is advising I don't go.

02:46.932 --> 02:48.131
Strongly advising.

02:48.133 --> 02:49.700
Oh, I need to look out over the water, John.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.935
I want to hear the music, see the lights.

02:51.937 --> 02:54.171
Besides, I haven't missed one in 20 years.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.906
So then you've had a good run.

02:55.908 --> 02:58.341
And I thought I had a
terrible bedside manner.

02:58.343 --> 03:00.177
You know what I mean.

03:00.179 --> 03:01.977
Step in anytime, Dr. Reid.

03:06.217 --> 03:08.383
Don't you look at me that way.

03:08.385 --> 03:11.821
I'm going stir-crazy in here,
and I need a change of scenery.

03:11.823 --> 03:13.122
Dana...

03:13.124 --> 03:16.391
and besides, Molly was
born during a cottage fest.

03:16.393 --> 03:17.826
She was?

03:17.828 --> 03:19.828
I've never told you this?

03:19.830 --> 03:21.129
- No.
- Oh.

03:22.833 --> 03:27.468
My water broke right there in
a Muskoka chair on the deck.

03:27.470 --> 03:31.539
And as soon as it did,
the fireworks started.

03:31.541 --> 03:33.307
I watched the whole show,

03:33.309 --> 03:35.042
and I got myself to the hospital,

03:35.044 --> 03:37.111
but, oh, it was magical...

03:37.113 --> 03:40.080
Molly's birth and the lights and...

03:41.884 --> 03:43.884
Life was worth living.

03:43.886 --> 03:45.552
It still is.

03:47.634 --> 03:49.607
Has Molly been around?

03:49.657 --> 03:51.524
Well, you know, I...

03:51.526 --> 03:54.628
She's a college kid with a busy life,

03:54.678 --> 03:56.877
and, um, I don't...
I don't want to burden her with this

03:56.927 --> 03:59.197
any more than I already have.

04:00.533 --> 04:04.270
Plus, we, um... we had words.

04:04.272 --> 04:06.072
What do you mean you had words?

04:06.074 --> 04:07.306
I don't know.

04:07.308 --> 04:08.507
Just started out as something stupid

04:08.509 --> 04:09.775
and it got a little...

04:10.978 --> 04:13.912
it got a bit heated,
and we haven't spoken in awhile.

04:17.349 --> 04:21.619
But, you know, the problem is,
we're both so much alike.

04:21.620 --> 04:22.553
Stubborn?

04:22.555 --> 04:24.489
I was gonna say willful.

04:25.692 --> 04:29.093
And neither of us apologize very well.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.630
Come on, Reid. Break me out of here.

04:33.632 --> 04:35.900
Stroman will never even know we're gone.

04:39.437 --> 04:41.172
I'm just gonna get back to my rounds,

04:41.174 --> 04:43.339
but I will come back,
and I will visit you soon.

04:46.410 --> 04:48.711
I'll be here.

04:51.049 --> 04:52.715
Oh!

04:52.717 --> 04:54.284
Sorry.

04:54.286 --> 04:55.785
"Barnes, McCarthy, and Lyons"?

04:55.787 --> 04:57.353
Dr. Bishop, are you being sued?

04:57.355 --> 04:58.955
I'm not being sued.

04:58.957 --> 05:00.322
Trauma-team leader today?

05:00.324 --> 05:02.291
That's right, so a little respect.

05:02.293 --> 05:03.658
Yes, sir.

05:03.660 --> 05:05.427
Okay, first case... male in his 40s.

05:05.429 --> 05:06.661
- Got crushed by a tractor.
- Ooh.

05:06.663 --> 05:08.096
He's coming in from Tillsonburg County.

05:08.098 --> 05:09.298
Tillsonburg? No way.

05:09.300 --> 05:10.398
You're familiar with it?

05:10.400 --> 05:11.934
Yeah, I grew up in a neighboring town.

05:11.936 --> 05:14.303
Both of them are too small to
handle an accident like that.

05:14.305 --> 05:16.205
Oh, we can, and we will.

05:16.207 --> 05:18.005
Oh, captain, my captain.

05:18.007 --> 05:19.273
Well, at the end of this shift,

05:19.275 --> 05:20.908
this captain will be downing tequila shots.

05:21.711 --> 05:23.144
You should join me.

05:23.146 --> 05:26.380
Oh. Oh, no, I-I don't think
that I would... I mean should.

05:26.382 --> 05:28.582
I just... I've kind of
sworn off men in my life

05:28.584 --> 05:29.616
for the time being.

05:29.618 --> 05:31.252
You know, I'm just trying to avoid

05:31.254 --> 05:33.387
complicating my life any
more than it already is.

05:33.389 --> 05:34.787
Good luck with that.

05:35.858 --> 05:37.023
Plus, you know,

05:37.025 --> 05:39.292
you're not really my type.

05:39.294 --> 05:41.527
But you're mine.

05:41.529 --> 05:43.330
So, our crush injury... how close?

05:45.000 --> 05:46.366
That close.

05:46.368 --> 05:48.668
Hey, Russ. I'm Dr. Bishop.

05:48.670 --> 05:49.970
Are you having trouble breathing?

05:49.972 --> 05:52.537
A little. Not too bad.

05:52.539 --> 05:54.206
All right, let's transfer on three.

05:54.208 --> 05:55.875
One, two, three.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.912
Uh, hey. Uh, what time is it?

05:59.914 --> 06:01.080
Uh, you found him?

06:01.082 --> 06:03.215
Yeah. The tractor flipped
right on top of him.

06:03.217 --> 06:04.549
Is it noon yet?

06:04.551 --> 06:07.619
- And you're his...
- Wife. Tracy. I called 911.

06:07.621 --> 06:09.053
Hey, Tracy, while you're
welcome to stay with us,

06:09.055 --> 06:10.355
you just got to hang out right there, okay?

06:10.357 --> 06:12.423
Dr. Harris, why don't you
do sensory and motor?

06:12.425 --> 06:13.358
Cassie, run a F.A.S.T.

06:13.360 --> 06:14.692
Hey, Russ, can you feel that?

06:14.694 --> 06:17.996
Sure. Look, you seriously
need to fix me up before noon.

06:17.998 --> 06:19.463
Why is that?

06:19.465 --> 06:22.633
Because nothing good is gonna
happen after 12:00 P.M. today.

06:22.635 --> 06:24.535
Sorry, what?

06:24.537 --> 06:26.703
The moon is in capricorn.

06:26.705 --> 06:28.738
Okay, we may need to get
a head C.T., as well.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.507
No, h-he's always like this.

06:30.509 --> 06:32.442
Russ is just very in tune with the elements.

06:32.444 --> 06:35.045
Ah, when you say it like that,
you make me sound like I'm nuts.

06:35.047 --> 06:36.613
Like harvesting in the middle of the night

06:36.615 --> 06:37.981
and rolling a tractor on top of yourself

06:37.983 --> 06:39.016
didn't accomplish that?

06:39.018 --> 06:41.584
I had to beat the storm. You know that.

06:41.586 --> 06:43.119
Hey, Russ,
just push down on your foot

06:43.121 --> 06:44.453
like you're hitting the brake.

06:44.455 --> 06:46.422
A storm that no one else is predicting,

06:46.424 --> 06:47.723
not even the weather network.

06:47.725 --> 06:49.691
Since when do I listen to
the weather network, Tracy?

06:49.693 --> 06:50.927
Abdomen looks clear.

06:50.929 --> 06:53.162
All right, let's have a
listen to your chest.

06:53.164 --> 06:55.131
Oh, you got yourself good.

06:55.133 --> 06:56.332
Paradoxical chest-wall movement.

06:56.334 --> 06:57.466
Looks like we got flail chest.

06:57.468 --> 06:58.634
Okay, let's get a chest tube in him

06:58.636 --> 06:59.834
and get him prepped for surgery.

06:59.836 --> 07:04.072
The moon is in capricorn.
The cows are restless.

07:04.074 --> 07:07.042
Do you know what that means?

07:09.146 --> 07:12.247
Nothing good, apparently.

07:14.000 --> 07:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:26.783 --> 07:27.883
Okay, plate is secure.

07:27.885 --> 07:29.552
Okay, just make sure it's steady.

07:29.554 --> 07:31.554
I'm awfully close to Russ's heart there.

07:31.556 --> 07:34.089
Yeah, well, you're awfully
close to a lot of things...

07:34.091 --> 07:36.891
liver, lungs, spleen.

07:39.629 --> 07:40.795
Depth gauge, please.

07:44.933 --> 07:47.602
And...

07:47.604 --> 07:48.670
okay, I'm gonna need

07:48.672 --> 07:50.605
a 12-millimeter cortical screw, please.

07:54.209 --> 07:55.342
Can you see me?

07:57.179 --> 08:00.447
Dr. Harris, how long have you and
Dr. Bishop known each other?

08:00.449 --> 08:02.516
Look, there's a storm coming,

08:02.518 --> 08:04.851
and half my crop's in the ground.

08:04.853 --> 08:05.919
You know what? Um, hey, everybody.

08:05.921 --> 08:07.254
Just listen up for a quick sec.

08:07.256 --> 08:10.390
Um, today I would just like
to focus on the medicine

08:10.392 --> 08:12.292
if I could, okay?

08:12.294 --> 08:13.593
Nothing personal.

08:13.595 --> 08:15.795
I just, uh... you know,
just want to focus on

08:15.797 --> 08:18.030
good old-fashioned old-school medicine,

08:18.032 --> 08:20.733
saving lives with common
sense like we do, right?

08:20.735 --> 08:21.901
Right.

08:21.903 --> 08:24.404
You got to get ahold of
my cousin Ed in Dewson.

08:28.475 --> 08:30.209
Got a... got a problem here.

08:30.211 --> 08:32.244
You drop the hardware in me?

08:32.246 --> 08:34.212
That's... that's bad luck.

08:34.215 --> 08:36.515
I bet you anything it's after 12:00.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.519
What'd I tell you?

08:40.520 --> 08:43.554
Should we get a chest X-ray,
locate the screw you dropped?

08:43.557 --> 08:45.089
- Or...
- Dr. Harris, should I...

08:45.091 --> 08:46.724
my hands are smaller than yours,

08:46.726 --> 08:48.392
so I could...
better to root around...

08:48.394 --> 08:49.993
Okay, everybody relax.

08:49.995 --> 08:51.729
Probably in the pleura, okay?

08:51.731 --> 08:53.864
Pickups, please.

08:55.100 --> 08:56.234
Thank you.

09:02.940 --> 09:04.608
First bit of luck I had all day.

09:06.477 --> 09:09.011
maybe the winds are starting to shift.

09:11.082 --> 09:12.249
Thank you.

09:13.417 --> 09:15.752
Not a good time.

09:16.820 --> 09:19.855
Dawn, I just wanted to ask...

09:21.157 --> 09:23.759
You know, there are people you
can hire to do that for you.

09:23.761 --> 09:25.193
What do you want, Zach?

09:25.195 --> 09:27.263
Actually, it's my staff.

09:27.265 --> 09:30.499
They want disposable safety glasses.

09:30.501 --> 09:32.668
I know it's not
very eco-friendly, but...

09:32.670 --> 09:34.102
Sure. Fine.

09:34.104 --> 09:35.103
Great.

09:35.105 --> 09:36.937
Yeah, also, uh...

09:36.939 --> 09:38.239
Tongue depressors.

09:38.241 --> 09:40.040
You know, there's a new
brand they'd like to try.

09:40.042 --> 09:41.309
Tongue depressors.

09:41.311 --> 09:42.277
That's right.

09:44.513 --> 09:46.481
Dr. Miller, if you want to
ask how the arraignment went,

09:46.483 --> 09:48.583
I suggest you just do it already.

09:51.553 --> 09:52.819
How was the arraignment?

09:54.289 --> 09:56.256
None of your business.

10:02.530 --> 10:05.365
It was exhausting.

10:05.367 --> 10:08.067
But they're pursuing all of
the charges against Lane.

10:08.069 --> 10:09.402
That's great.

10:09.404 --> 10:11.437
Yeah, it is.

10:11.439 --> 10:14.507
And the office makeover is to celebrate?

10:14.509 --> 10:16.375
The opposite, actually.

10:16.377 --> 10:18.477
This is where it happened.

10:25.352 --> 10:27.985
I should get that.

10:27.987 --> 10:30.221
Thanks for asking.

10:30.223 --> 10:31.790
Yeah.

10:34.860 --> 10:38.162
Hey, Reebs. How are you?

10:38.164 --> 10:39.831
What? Okay, wait. Slow down.

10:39.833 --> 10:40.865
Where are you?

10:40.867 --> 10:41.933
The Allen trail.

10:41.935 --> 10:43.434
What are you doing all the way out there?

10:43.436 --> 10:45.803
Currently,
I'm trying not to freak out

10:45.805 --> 10:48.138
about this gnarly spider
bite I got on my ankle.

10:49.308 --> 10:50.507
Ohh.

10:50.509 --> 10:52.976
Spider bite?

10:52.978 --> 10:55.846
Is there any chance this
thing could be poisonous?

10:55.848 --> 10:56.880
No, Reebs.

10:56.882 --> 10:58.949
There's no poisonous spiders out there.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.250
Dawn.

11:00.252 --> 11:01.718
Ask her what the spider looked like.

11:01.720 --> 11:02.952
Why are you still here?

11:02.954 --> 11:04.053
Because you need me.

11:04.055 --> 11:04.954
No, I don't.

11:04.956 --> 11:07.089
Yes, you do

11:07.091 --> 11:09.291
because I just happen to be an E.R. doctor

11:09.293 --> 11:10.426
with a vast knowledge

11:10.428 --> 11:12.428
of the clinical toxicology of venoms.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.130
So, actually, your friend needs me.

11:17.167 --> 11:18.767
What's the latest on Dana?

11:18.769 --> 11:21.536
We're still waiting to find out
whether her tumor has shrunk.

11:21.538 --> 11:23.472
- She has a bit of pneumonia.
- Happens.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.440
And she's stuck here. She feels trapped.

11:25.442 --> 11:27.141
She wants to get back up to the cottage.

11:27.143 --> 11:28.510
Anything we can do?

11:28.512 --> 11:29.746
She wants me to bust her out of here,

11:29.796 --> 11:31.612
but I still have this mountain to climb.

11:31.662 --> 11:32.547
Busy lady.

11:32.549 --> 11:35.916
Not to mention that
Dr. Stroman is dead set against it.

11:35.918 --> 11:37.084
How do you feel?

11:37.086 --> 11:39.887
As a physician,
I have to respect his wishes.

11:39.889 --> 11:42.790
Yeah, but as Dana's friend?

11:44.259 --> 11:45.959
I'd do anything to lift her spirits.

11:45.961 --> 11:48.362
I think you need to figure
out which hat you're wearing.

11:50.565 --> 11:52.632
Do you mind covering my patients for me?

11:52.634 --> 11:54.233
Hand the mountain over.

11:54.235 --> 11:55.602
You're sure?

11:55.604 --> 11:57.837
You need as much Dana as you can get,
and she needs you, so...

11:57.839 --> 12:00.139
- Come on.
- I owe you big-time.

12:00.141 --> 12:01.173
Thank you.

12:03.076 --> 12:06.413
Okay, I'm gonna send you one
more picture to take a look at.

12:06.415 --> 12:08.480
- So, hiking, huh?
- That doesn't sound like you.

12:08.482 --> 12:09.815
Where's Roger?

12:09.817 --> 12:12.317
He's probably moving
into his new condo by now.

12:12.319 --> 12:13.719
Moving?

12:13.721 --> 12:15.387
Oh, Reebs.

12:15.389 --> 12:16.855
I know. I didn't want to say anything,

12:16.857 --> 12:19.458
but we're getting a divorce.

12:19.460 --> 12:22.828
19 years down the tubes. Can you believe it?

12:22.830 --> 12:25.496
Oh, crap. I forgot I was on speakerphone.

12:25.498 --> 12:27.364
Sorry, strange doctor.

12:27.366 --> 12:29.967
That's okay. I'm a vault.

12:29.969 --> 12:31.536
Why didn't you tell me?

12:31.538 --> 12:33.471
I was too embarrassed.

12:33.473 --> 12:34.939
Yeah, but it's me.

12:34.941 --> 12:36.908
All the more reason. I mean, come on, Dawn.

12:36.910 --> 12:39.844
You're always so put together and...

12:39.846 --> 12:41.579
nothing phases you.

12:42.580 --> 12:43.647
Right.

12:45.683 --> 12:46.683
Hey, wait.

12:46.685 --> 12:48.718
That text you just sent me...

12:48.720 --> 12:51.220
Yeah, that's it.
That's the spider that bit me.

12:54.292 --> 12:55.459
Northern black widow.

12:55.461 --> 12:56.993
Is that bad?

12:56.995 --> 12:58.628
Its neurovenom can be fatal

12:58.630 --> 13:00.596
in only like 1% of the population, but...

13:00.598 --> 13:01.997
I can't hear you.

13:01.999 --> 13:04.299
Okay, just h-hold tight, Reebs.

13:04.301 --> 13:06.268
Reba, the chance of this spider's venom

13:06.270 --> 13:09.071
actually harming you are extremely low.

13:09.073 --> 13:11.006
It was a poisonous spider?

13:11.008 --> 13:12.240
Oh, my god.

13:12.242 --> 13:14.142
R-relax. Everything is going to be fine.

13:14.144 --> 13:17.378
Get in your car, drive here,
and we will check you out, okay?

13:18.748 --> 13:22.116
Guys, I'm having a hard time
getting a breath in here.

13:22.118 --> 13:24.786
She's just panicking now.

13:24.788 --> 13:26.788
I tell you what,
how about we stay with you

13:26.790 --> 13:27.989
until you get to your car?

13:27.991 --> 13:30.424
Okay, yeah, please. Let's do that.

13:30.426 --> 13:31.793
You don't have to stay.

13:31.795 --> 13:33.594
No. I want to.

13:35.897 --> 13:39.299
So, tell me, Reba,
what was Dawn like in college?

13:44.205 --> 13:47.541
What's a nine-letter word for
"I'm dying of boredom"?

13:47.543 --> 13:49.743
I don't know. I hate crosswords.

13:49.745 --> 13:51.443
Me too.

13:51.445 --> 13:53.980
But I do like a nice road trip.

13:56.517 --> 13:57.817
No, seriously?

13:58.852 --> 14:01.954
I always knew you were a badass.

14:01.956 --> 14:03.923
Pack your things, Thelma.

14:03.925 --> 14:05.324
I love you, Louise.

14:07.160 --> 14:08.393
We are almost free.

14:08.395 --> 14:10.228
Step on it, Reid.
Let's see what this baby can do.

14:10.230 --> 14:11.462
Keep your eyes peeled.

14:11.464 --> 14:13.264
Okay.

14:13.266 --> 14:14.566
Aah!

14:14.568 --> 14:15.366
What?

14:15.368 --> 14:16.334
Buzzkill, 12:00.

14:16.336 --> 14:18.069
Is that our secret code word?

14:18.071 --> 14:19.470
Oh! Whiplash.

14:19.472 --> 14:20.471
Hold on to your scarf.

14:20.473 --> 14:21.806
What, are you trying to kill me?

14:21.808 --> 14:22.807
Don't tempt me.

14:22.809 --> 14:24.009
Too soon.

14:26.579 --> 14:28.167
Your husband's surgery went smoothly,

14:28.217 --> 14:30.548
but he has suffered a major trauma.

14:30.550 --> 14:32.783
He's... he's gonna need plenty of rehab.

14:32.785 --> 14:35.286
I can't believe this is happening.

14:35.288 --> 14:36.320
Accidents happen.

14:36.322 --> 14:38.356
Seems like all the time lately.

14:38.358 --> 14:41.191
What do you mean?

14:41.193 --> 14:42.426
Russ has always had

14:42.428 --> 14:44.394
an unorthodox approach to farming.

14:44.396 --> 14:46.196
But it's served us well over the years.

14:46.198 --> 14:48.065
You know, we've been clearing six figures

14:48.067 --> 14:50.467
when everybody else around
us has been closing up shop.

14:50.469 --> 14:52.802
Wow. That kind of thing's
unheard of in farming.

14:52.804 --> 14:57.507
But lately, his eccentricities...

14:57.509 --> 14:58.807
they're out of control.

14:58.809 --> 15:00.842
You know, he thinks he
can predict the weather

15:00.844 --> 15:02.844
by how the cows are moving.

15:05.483 --> 15:06.582
Can I see him now?

15:06.584 --> 15:08.917
Yeah. Of course.

15:10.987 --> 15:13.155
Russ, how you doing?

15:17.227 --> 15:20.061
Are you filling their heads with
all kind of nonsense about me?

15:24.166 --> 15:26.468
Did you get ahold of Ed?

15:28.270 --> 15:29.270
Tracy?

15:31.006 --> 15:33.440
No. I will.

15:33.442 --> 15:35.041
W-we're running out of time.

15:35.043 --> 15:36.710
I know. The storm.

15:36.712 --> 15:39.746
Um, Russ, your surgery went well.

15:39.748 --> 15:41.982
Good. Good.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.985
So... when do I get out?

15:44.987 --> 15:49.322
You have three new plates in your chest.

15:49.324 --> 15:52.057
Built-in lightning rods.

15:52.059 --> 15:53.759
Right on.

15:53.761 --> 15:55.595
Yeah, we're gonna get you up and moving,

15:55.597 --> 15:57.630
but there's not gonna
be any farm work for you

15:57.632 --> 15:58.797
in the foreseeable future.

15:58.799 --> 16:00.466
Uh...

16:00.468 --> 16:02.001
What are we gonna do?

16:02.003 --> 16:04.170
We'll figure something out.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.338
I don't know...

16:05.340 --> 16:09.073
Hey. It's gonna be okay.

16:13.112 --> 16:14.146
Baby, what is it?

16:14.148 --> 16:16.248
Why can't I feel my legs?

16:16.250 --> 16:17.616
What?

16:17.618 --> 16:19.518
His vitals are all over the place.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.287
Hang on.

16:24.323 --> 16:25.756
Russ, can you feel that?

16:25.758 --> 16:27.491
No.

16:27.493 --> 16:29.527
Okay, push against my
hand as hard as you can.

16:31.264 --> 16:32.429
What the hell's going on?

16:32.431 --> 16:34.365
I need to get
another look at his spine.

16:34.367 --> 16:36.133
I'm getting a lot of free
fluid around the spleen.

16:36.135 --> 16:37.468
Page Dr. Bishop!

16:37.470 --> 16:39.503
We need to get this patient back to the O.R.

16:46.215 --> 16:49.316
Oh. And last but not least...

16:49.318 --> 16:51.652
This is the longest bucket list of all time.

16:53.422 --> 16:55.756
I really want to see "Dumb & dumber."

16:55.758 --> 16:57.057
Dana, how much morphine are you on?

16:57.059 --> 16:59.159
No, Molly's seen it a hundred times.

16:59.161 --> 17:01.762
She's wanted me to watch
it with her for years.

17:01.764 --> 17:04.464
Yes, but you haven't because
you're too much of a film snob?

17:04.465 --> 17:07.400
Well, I was.
I'm too sick to be snobby.

17:10.069 --> 17:11.303
Found it.

17:11.305 --> 17:12.672
Looks like the spleen's been punctured.

17:12.674 --> 17:14.507
We're gonna need to sew this hole up.

17:14.509 --> 17:16.075
Can I get 5-0 non-absorbable?

17:18.811 --> 17:21.512
So, you're a farm girl.

17:21.515 --> 17:23.047
That's kind of hard to believe.

17:23.049 --> 17:25.650
Believe it. I was born
in Tillsonburg County.

17:25.652 --> 17:26.617
So was my mom.

17:26.619 --> 17:28.620
Yeah, and her mama before her?

17:28.622 --> 17:30.555
I'll have you know I come
from a long line of ladies

17:30.557 --> 17:31.890
who know their way around a pitchfork.

17:31.892 --> 17:33.725
Oh, good to know.

17:34.627 --> 17:35.960
Done.

17:35.962 --> 17:37.160
All right, suction.

17:38.363 --> 17:40.598
Whoa. Dr. Bishop?

17:41.900 --> 17:43.434
Oh, I just fixed the bleeder.

17:43.436 --> 17:45.369
Where's all this new blood coming from?

17:45.371 --> 17:47.271
I have no idea. Wait. Stop suctioning.

17:47.273 --> 17:49.473
We got to figure out the new source.

17:49.475 --> 17:50.574
Ohh.

17:50.576 --> 17:53.243
Looks like the spleen's
been punctured twice.

17:53.245 --> 17:54.811
Could that have been caused
when the screw dropped

17:54.813 --> 17:55.745
when we were plating?

17:55.747 --> 17:57.346
No, I don't think so.

17:57.348 --> 17:58.481
The hole is way too small

17:58.483 --> 18:00.383
for the screw to have
caused this kind of damage.

18:00.385 --> 18:02.452
So then what did?

18:02.454 --> 18:04.120
Can I get a clean sponge?

18:08.259 --> 18:10.893
Dr. Connick, line four.

18:10.895 --> 18:12.828
Tracy.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.195
How's he doing?

18:14.197 --> 18:15.664
We were able to locate and control

18:15.666 --> 18:16.665
your husband's bleeding.

18:16.667 --> 18:18.767
He's in stable condition.

18:18.769 --> 18:19.868
But he's still...

18:19.870 --> 18:21.437
Paralyzed.

18:21.439 --> 18:22.704
Yes.

18:22.706 --> 18:24.272
Is that gonna be permanent?

18:24.274 --> 18:26.141
Is he... is he gonna be crippled for life?

18:26.143 --> 18:27.975
It's too early to tell.

18:27.977 --> 18:30.578
Dr. Harris is waiting on some new imaging.

18:30.580 --> 18:33.247
That should give us a better
indication of what's going on.

18:33.249 --> 18:35.049
I heard him getting up.

18:35.051 --> 18:38.319
I never should've let him go out so early.

18:38.321 --> 18:40.187
This isn't your fault.

18:40.189 --> 18:42.356
It's... the farm has been in
Russ' family for generations.

18:42.358 --> 18:43.324
If he can't run it...

18:43.326 --> 18:44.724
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

18:44.726 --> 18:46.125
Even if he does get better,

18:46.127 --> 18:49.262
he's gonna go right back out
there and keep acting crazy.

18:49.264 --> 18:51.397
And then he'll do it again, only worse.

18:51.399 --> 18:54.434
Tracy, it's important that we
take this one step at a time.

18:54.436 --> 18:56.169
I just...

18:56.171 --> 18:58.371
I just don't know how much
more of it I can take.

18:58.373 --> 19:00.273
Are you thinking of leaving him?

19:01.975 --> 19:04.477
I didn't say that.

19:04.479 --> 19:05.978
Why would you ask me that?

19:05.980 --> 19:07.780
I'm sorry.
That's none of my business.

19:07.782 --> 19:09.982
I need to get some air.

19:09.984 --> 19:12.050
Yeah.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.356
You okay?

19:18.358 --> 19:21.092
Yeah. Yeah.

19:21.094 --> 19:24.962
Just thinking about Molly.

19:26.032 --> 19:28.032
You know she's taking the semester off?

19:28.034 --> 19:29.434
She told me.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.803
She said she got a job as a
barista right by your house.

19:31.805 --> 19:33.438
12 years of private school

19:33.440 --> 19:36.073
so she can sling coffee to the neighbors.

19:36.075 --> 19:38.609
She wants to be near you.

19:38.611 --> 19:39.943
Is that why you two had a fight?

19:39.945 --> 19:41.478
You don't want her to the semester off?

19:41.480 --> 19:43.113
No, I just...

19:45.283 --> 19:46.550
Alex, you have to make sure

19:46.552 --> 19:48.919
she doesn't drop out of school if I...

19:48.921 --> 19:52.089
I will be there for her

19:52.091 --> 19:54.924
if you're not, okay?

19:59.230 --> 20:01.431
Everyone knows they're gonna die,

20:01.433 --> 20:04.634
but you never actually believe it.

20:04.636 --> 20:05.801
That's true.

20:05.803 --> 20:08.304
Why do we kid
ourselves about death?

20:08.306 --> 20:10.372
Maybe it's the only way we can bear it.

20:10.374 --> 20:12.374
But that's not what the buddhists think.

20:12.376 --> 20:13.808
They think that everyone

20:13.810 --> 20:16.077
should be prepared at all times for death.

20:16.079 --> 20:18.079
Yeah, well, that's easier said than done.

20:18.081 --> 20:20.482
No, they think you should
wake up every day and think,

20:20.484 --> 20:23.318
"if this is the day,"

20:23.320 --> 20:27.321
"am I being the person that I want to be?"

20:27.323 --> 20:30.224
"Am I ready?"

20:30.226 --> 20:31.925
Dana.

20:33.695 --> 20:35.563
Sorry.

20:35.565 --> 20:37.565
Enough maudlin.

20:40.370 --> 20:43.970
I had no idea I parked so far.

20:43.972 --> 20:45.538
How much more daylight?

20:45.540 --> 20:47.240
There's tons of daylight left.

20:47.242 --> 20:49.342
You're doing great.

20:49.344 --> 20:53.346
So, Reba, come on.
Give me some more dirt on Dawn.

20:53.348 --> 20:55.248
How long you two known each other?

20:55.250 --> 20:56.549
Since first year.

20:56.551 --> 20:58.618
You should ask her about when we got bedbugs

20:58.620 --> 21:00.352
and had to sleep in the guys' dorm.

21:01.422 --> 21:03.389
That's when I hooked up with Gary Winestock.

21:03.391 --> 21:04.456
You remember him?

21:04.458 --> 21:06.292
Gary Winestock. Hmm.

21:06.294 --> 21:09.561
Old Gary and his fusion-rock mixtapes.

21:09.563 --> 21:10.596
Nice.

21:10.598 --> 21:11.430
His overalls.

21:11.432 --> 21:13.031
Overalls? Nice.

21:13.033 --> 21:14.600
So he... he's a farmer?

21:14.602 --> 21:17.868
She decided the only way
to truly defeat the vermin

21:17.870 --> 21:20.137
was to drop off the grid completely.

21:20.139 --> 21:21.071
That's true.

21:21.073 --> 21:22.807
I moved into the campground

21:22.809 --> 21:28.078
and bathed in the river,
cooked on a portable stove.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.281
I'd like to have seen that.

21:30.283 --> 21:33.418
Not the... well, the stove part.

21:37.856 --> 21:39.055
I don't know, guys.

21:39.057 --> 21:41.024
I think I'm starting to feel a little woozy.

21:41.026 --> 21:43.427
Just keep talking to us, Reeb.

21:47.899 --> 21:50.734
My legs are really starting to cramp now.

21:50.736 --> 21:53.035
It's just 'cause
you've been hiking all day.

21:53.037 --> 21:55.338
You're just feeling stressed.

21:55.340 --> 21:57.005
Probably a psychosomatic...

22:00.144 --> 22:02.044
Reba? What happened?

22:02.046 --> 22:05.147
I fell. My legs just gave out.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.416
Reba, are you feeling nauseous?

22:07.418 --> 22:08.916
Any stomach cramps?

22:08.918 --> 22:12.019
Yeah, really, really bad. How did you know?

22:12.021 --> 22:13.455
It's the neurovenom?

22:13.457 --> 22:16.190
Reba, I want you to lie on your
side and keep talking to us.

22:16.192 --> 22:18.226
Okay.

22:18.228 --> 22:20.328
Am I gonna die?

22:20.330 --> 22:21.463
No, Reba.

22:21.465 --> 22:24.666
I just... I want you to stay calm, okay?

22:24.668 --> 22:26.900
She's going into shock. Call the medevac.

22:30.137 --> 22:33.129
Oh, I wish I wasn't permanently exhausted.

22:33.179 --> 22:35.343
You've just been through a war, Dana.

22:35.393 --> 22:37.878
It's gonna take some time for
things to feel normal again.

22:38.989 --> 22:42.658
Scary thing is, I don't even
remember what normal feels like.

22:42.708 --> 22:46.010
We're gonna get you through this,
you need to trust me.

22:47.488 --> 22:49.889
Even when you're in the dark.

22:49.891 --> 22:52.692
Even when you're falling.

22:52.694 --> 22:54.527
I trust you, sweetheart.

22:54.529 --> 22:56.396
I do.

23:00.901 --> 23:03.402
Hey. You all right?

23:04.671 --> 23:08.306
It feels like I have a
thousand daggers in my chest.

23:08.308 --> 23:10.675
We're gonna have to turn back.

23:10.677 --> 23:11.743
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

23:11.745 --> 23:13.578
We're not gonna make it to the cottage.

23:13.580 --> 23:16.247
It's okay. We were never
going to the cottage anyway.

23:16.249 --> 23:18.449
What? Where the hell are we going then?

23:18.451 --> 23:20.317
Your cottage fest, all the memories of it

23:20.319 --> 23:23.020
are all about one person.

23:24.322 --> 23:25.155
Molly.

23:25.157 --> 23:26.557
Mm.

23:26.559 --> 23:30.694
Sometimes all a couple willful
ladies need is a peacemaker.

23:32.364 --> 23:34.731
Dana, it's your daughter you need to see,

23:34.733 --> 23:36.933
not the stupid lake.

23:42.471 --> 23:44.927
Keep looking. Is there
anything else in your backpack?

23:44.929 --> 23:47.796
Uh, just a map, pack of salt...

23:47.798 --> 23:50.733
a nickel, and another nickel.

23:50.735 --> 23:53.335
Okay, and you don't have any
ibuprofen, any meds at all?

23:53.825 --> 23:54.760
Uh...

23:54.810 --> 23:57.060
Nothing except for the antacids

23:57.110 --> 23:59.776
that I've come to rely on like a crutch.

24:00.574 --> 24:02.996
Reba, I want you to find a couple of rocks.

24:03.046 --> 24:04.378
Yeah, why?

24:04.380 --> 24:06.814
Because I want you to take
the salt and the antacid,

24:06.816 --> 24:08.049
and I want you to grind it

24:08.051 --> 24:09.984
into a fine powder with the rocks, okay?

24:09.986 --> 24:11.352
Okay.

24:11.354 --> 24:12.553
Okay, great.

24:12.555 --> 24:13.887
Her brain is losing sodium.

24:13.889 --> 24:16.022
The antacid should conceivably prevent her

24:16.024 --> 24:17.157
from going into shock.

24:17.159 --> 24:18.291
- Conceivably.
- Yeah.

24:18.293 --> 24:20.360
Put it this way... it can't do any harm.

24:20.362 --> 24:21.694
And in the meantime, it'll give her

24:21.696 --> 24:23.629
something active to do to
distract her from the panic.

24:23.631 --> 24:24.897
That's right.

24:24.899 --> 24:26.933
I seem to remember you doing
something like that for me.

24:26.935 --> 24:28.868
And how'd that work out?

24:28.870 --> 24:30.003
I'm still here.

24:30.005 --> 24:31.570
Exactly.

24:31.572 --> 24:34.840
And put it this way...
stranger things have happened.

24:37.077 --> 24:39.111
Tracy. Hey.

24:39.113 --> 24:40.179
How is he?

24:40.181 --> 24:42.147
We should have something
to report very soon.

24:45.018 --> 24:47.752
Look, what I said earlier...

24:47.754 --> 24:50.288
your marriage is none of my business.

24:50.290 --> 24:52.256
You were just being honest.

24:52.258 --> 24:55.960
Well, you're not the person
I need to get honest with.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.062
Somebody left you?

25:01.266 --> 25:02.967
Apology accepted.

25:02.969 --> 25:05.235
Thank you.

25:05.237 --> 25:06.970
We're still trying to solve
your husband's paralysis.

25:06.972 --> 25:08.872
We're not giving up on him.

25:10.741 --> 25:13.210
I don't want to, either.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.645
I love him so much.

25:15.647 --> 25:19.082
But this year has been... just crazy.

25:20.386 --> 25:22.551
His behavior is... the other night,

25:22.553 --> 25:25.488
I found him standing
outside in his underwear,

25:25.490 --> 25:28.290
in the middle of the night, holding a rifle.

25:28.292 --> 25:31.860
That sounds like more than
just eccentric behavior.

25:33.330 --> 25:36.332
I even... I even called a divorce lawyer.

25:39.201 --> 25:42.070
I hung up before she answered.

25:47.344 --> 25:49.411
Russ' imaging is in.

25:49.413 --> 25:51.879
I'll come find you.

25:56.984 --> 25:59.153
Hey, Charlie.

25:59.155 --> 26:00.587
I'm still here.

26:00.589 --> 26:01.655
Yeah, I can see that.

26:01.657 --> 26:03.723
Yeah, so why haven't you fixed me up yet?

26:03.725 --> 26:05.359
You got a bone to pick with me?

26:05.361 --> 26:07.661
You just make that up on the fly?

26:07.663 --> 26:10.297
I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:10.299 --> 26:11.898
Bone to pick?

26:11.900 --> 26:13.466
An orthopedic surgeon.

26:15.469 --> 26:17.170
Never mind.

26:17.172 --> 26:19.905
So, what's the holdup?

26:19.907 --> 26:22.475
Why am I still paralyzed, doc?

26:22.477 --> 26:25.644
Uh, I don't really have
an answer quite yet, Russ.

26:25.646 --> 26:29.182
Look, the farm, Tracy...
I'm nothing without them.

26:29.184 --> 26:31.316
I wake up, I'm still paralyzed,

26:31.318 --> 26:32.750
I could lose them both.

26:32.752 --> 26:34.986
I understand that, okay?
I'm-I'm doing my best here.

26:34.988 --> 26:36.988
Well... well, maybe your
best isn't good enough.

26:36.990 --> 26:38.990
Maybe you need my help.

26:38.992 --> 26:40.158
No.

26:40.160 --> 26:41.493
No, I'm good. I got this.

26:41.495 --> 26:44.229
Look, I have very good instincts
about these sorts of things.

26:44.231 --> 26:46.931
Like predicting the weather
by listening to the cows moo?

26:46.933 --> 26:48.132
Yeah.

26:48.134 --> 26:49.400
Y-you do the same thing.

26:49.402 --> 26:51.001
No, I don't.

26:51.003 --> 26:53.237
You're standing here talking to a ghost.

26:53.239 --> 26:55.539
What's the difference?

26:56.741 --> 27:00.111
I'm a doctor, a pretty good one.

27:00.113 --> 27:03.314
I'm gonna make sure you walk
out of here, okay, Russ?

27:03.316 --> 27:06.682
But right now,
I need to do things... my way.

27:09.886 --> 27:11.221
Good chat.

27:12.390 --> 27:13.856
Come on, Reba. You can do this.

27:13.858 --> 27:15.258
I know you can.

27:15.260 --> 27:17.927
Dawn.

27:17.929 --> 27:20.430
Don't let me die out here all by myself.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.368
What are you doing?

27:26.370 --> 27:28.003
Reba, do you remember in third year

27:28.005 --> 27:29.938
when you got that really nasty eye infection

27:29.940 --> 27:31.540
and I had to read to you?

27:31.542 --> 27:32.674
You were doing that paper

27:32.676 --> 27:35.177
on "pride and prejudice:
Gender and role reversal"

27:35.179 --> 27:36.811
"in 19th century literature."

27:36.813 --> 27:39.046
How did I even remember that, right?

27:39.048 --> 27:40.615
I do.

27:40.617 --> 27:43.217
I remember that.

27:43.219 --> 27:45.520
It's one of my best memories.

27:45.522 --> 27:48.256
Mine too.

27:48.258 --> 27:51.959
With you, it was the sound of your voice.

27:51.961 --> 27:55.295
So calming.

27:55.297 --> 27:57.864
You be Elizabeth.

27:57.866 --> 27:58.965
I'm sorry. What?

27:58.967 --> 28:00.233
Gender and role reversal.

28:00.235 --> 28:01.434
Come on. Let's do this.

28:01.436 --> 28:02.602
I'm Mr. Darcy.

28:02.604 --> 28:05.238
O-kay. Well, um... well, you go first.

28:10.546 --> 28:12.678
"In vain I have struggled."

28:12.680 --> 28:14.713
"It will not do."

28:14.715 --> 28:17.383
"My feelings will not be repressed."

28:17.385 --> 28:19.017
"You must allow me to tell you"

28:19.019 --> 28:23.622
"how ardently I admire and love you."

28:31.731 --> 28:35.766
"If I could feel gratitude,
I would now thank you."

28:35.768 --> 28:38.102
"But I cannot."

28:38.104 --> 28:39.970
"I have never desired your good opinion,"

28:39.972 --> 28:43.908
"and you have certainly
bestowed it most unwillingly."

28:52.351 --> 28:54.751
We lost her.

28:57.888 --> 29:00.357
No.

29:01.426 --> 29:04.627
Nothing.

29:04.629 --> 29:06.762
She's all alone out there, Zach.

29:06.764 --> 29:07.863
I-I know. I know.

29:07.865 --> 29:09.198
Hey, look, it's okay. Hey, hey, it's okay.

29:09.200 --> 29:10.466
The medics are on their way.

29:10.468 --> 29:13.236
What if they don't make it to her on time?

29:13.238 --> 29:16.105
She's my oldest friend

29:16.107 --> 29:18.674
from before...

29:18.676 --> 29:20.075
All of this.

29:20.077 --> 29:22.477
I know, I know. It's okay.

29:36.968 --> 29:38.134
I know that look.

29:38.136 --> 29:39.369
What look?

29:39.371 --> 29:40.403
This is one of his many

29:40.405 --> 29:41.838
"I'm figuring this out, but I got"

29:41.840 --> 29:43.840
"the weight of the world
on my shoulders" looks.

29:43.842 --> 29:47.310
Although, I haven't seen this
particular variation in a while.

29:48.980 --> 29:51.614
Oh, yeah. I totally see it.

29:51.616 --> 29:54.416
Yeah, what does this look say?

29:54.418 --> 29:55.951
Oh. I don't think I can repeat that

29:55.953 --> 29:57.652
in a professional environment.

29:57.654 --> 29:59.554
Okay.

29:59.556 --> 30:01.857
Uh, this is what Russ'
chest and spine looked like

30:01.859 --> 30:03.225
when he came into the E.R.

30:03.227 --> 30:08.530
So we plated the ribs here,
repaired the spleen there,

30:08.532 --> 30:10.031
but his legs are paralyzed.

30:10.033 --> 30:11.808
So we need to look at

30:11.858 --> 30:13.467
the thoracolumbar portion of his spine.

30:13.469 --> 30:15.636
Any questions, comments,
observations, or theories?

30:15.638 --> 30:17.338
Hmm. Maybe a splinter from one of his ribs

30:17.340 --> 30:19.207
cracked off and that's
what pierced his spleen.

30:19.209 --> 30:19.997
Plausible theory.

30:20.047 --> 30:21.578
However, we know there
were clean breaks only...

30:21.628 --> 30:22.843
no splintering.

30:22.845 --> 30:24.178
This is the second X-ray.

30:24.180 --> 30:26.914
This is what his spine and
ribs look like right now.

30:29.050 --> 30:30.817
He's had surgery on his clavicle.

30:32.586 --> 30:35.389
Oh. Sorry. Just an observation.

30:35.391 --> 30:37.757
No, Cassie, that's actually very good.

30:37.759 --> 30:41.061
This clavicle injury is old,
maybe happened in his teens.

30:41.063 --> 30:42.362
How do you know that?

30:42.364 --> 30:44.330
Because the surgeon who
repaired the fracture

30:44.332 --> 30:46.799
used Kirschner wires,

30:46.801 --> 30:49.335
and we don't use them
anymore to repair clavicles.

30:49.337 --> 30:50.536
Anyone want to know why?

30:50.538 --> 30:51.570
Because they break.

30:51.572 --> 30:53.005
And migrate.

30:53.007 --> 30:56.708
This morning, Russ had two
K-wires in his clavicle,

30:56.710 --> 31:00.746
and now there is a tiny piece missing.

31:00.748 --> 31:03.381
Which means...

31:03.383 --> 31:04.449
Yep.

31:04.451 --> 31:06.184
There's the little bugger right there,

31:06.186 --> 31:07.652
impinging on the vertebrae.

31:07.654 --> 31:09.354
Case of the migrating K-wire.

31:09.356 --> 31:10.521
I've got chills.

31:10.523 --> 31:12.057
So, we just need to get in there,

31:12.059 --> 31:13.524
remove the piece of broken wire,

31:13.526 --> 31:15.026
and give Russ his mobility back.

31:15.028 --> 31:17.829
Wow.
Dr. Harris, how did you do that?

31:17.831 --> 31:19.529
We did that

31:19.531 --> 31:22.433
using good, old-fashioned medicine.

31:22.435 --> 31:24.969
Look, it's okay.
They said that she just landed.

31:24.971 --> 31:26.203
Five minutes ago.

31:26.205 --> 31:28.572
They also said that she's stable.

31:28.574 --> 31:30.907
Okay, just stop trying
to make me feel better.

31:30.909 --> 31:33.477
It has the opposite effect.

31:35.012 --> 31:36.679
You were a huge help today.

31:36.681 --> 31:39.615
I wouldn't have been able to
keep her calm without you.

31:39.617 --> 31:41.184
Well, I would say that it's my pleasure,

31:41.186 --> 31:43.019
but I don't want it to
have the opposite effect,

31:43.021 --> 31:44.653
so I'll just say...

31:44.655 --> 31:46.755
it was my pleasure.

31:46.757 --> 31:48.757
I'm still your boss.

31:48.759 --> 31:50.593
No, you're not.

31:50.595 --> 31:52.794
Yes, I am.

31:52.796 --> 31:53.661
I'm the chief of...

31:53.663 --> 31:54.529
Surgery?

31:54.531 --> 31:56.731
Yeah. I'm not a surgeon.

31:58.068 --> 32:00.035
There she is.

32:03.772 --> 32:06.208
Reba!

32:06.210 --> 32:08.110
When we found her, she was barely conscious,

32:08.112 --> 32:09.977
but she's responding well to the antivenom.

32:09.979 --> 32:12.746
Ah, you're a sight for sore eyes.

32:12.748 --> 32:13.847
This is Dr. Miller.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.149
Oh, hi.

32:15.151 --> 32:18.919
You saved my life. I love you guys.

32:20.990 --> 32:23.790
It's a pleasure to meet
you finally in person.

32:23.792 --> 32:25.259
Dawn, I can't believe

32:25.261 --> 32:27.760
you've been keeping this
one a secret from me.

32:27.762 --> 32:30.063
You make such a cute couple.

32:37.105 --> 32:39.739
I just need to
close my eyes for a second.

32:39.741 --> 32:41.141
Thank you, sweetheart.

32:41.143 --> 32:43.909
- Of course.
- Mm.

32:43.911 --> 32:45.844
Molly.

32:58.591 --> 33:01.092
Must be hard
watching your mom struggle.

33:01.094 --> 33:03.594
Don't pretend like you and
mom aren't making plans.

33:03.596 --> 33:05.696
What do you mean, plans?

33:05.698 --> 33:08.332
For the end... you know,
how she wants to go.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.834
That's all she wants to talk about lately.

33:10.836 --> 33:12.770
Is that why you fought?

33:12.772 --> 33:14.705
Yeah.

33:14.707 --> 33:17.907
Molly, we are a long way off from that.

33:17.909 --> 33:21.545
You really have no idea?

33:21.547 --> 33:23.680
Alex, she's giving up.

33:23.682 --> 33:25.014
What are you talking about?

33:25.016 --> 33:27.384
Does my mom seem
super-zen to you these days...

33:27.386 --> 33:30.053
you know, buddhist quotes,
taking everything in stride?

33:30.055 --> 33:31.821
She did mention a bit earlier.

33:31.823 --> 33:34.423
That's what my mom does
when she's packing it in.

33:34.425 --> 33:36.258
That's what she did when she left my dad.

33:37.760 --> 33:41.363
But the thing is...

33:41.365 --> 33:43.299
I'm not ready for her to go.

33:43.301 --> 33:47.536
I am really, really not ready to let her go.

33:49.506 --> 33:52.006
Let's give her every reason to stay.

33:52.008 --> 33:54.309
Hmm?

33:54.311 --> 33:56.244
Yeah. Okay.

34:06.355 --> 34:08.522
Tracy.

34:08.524 --> 34:09.922
Is he okay?

34:09.925 --> 34:10.924
Yes.

34:10.926 --> 34:11.992
We, um... we figured out

34:11.994 --> 34:13.827
what was causing your husband's paralysis.

34:13.829 --> 34:15.429
Tell me it's good news, please.

34:15.431 --> 34:17.664
It is. Dr. Harris identified the problem.

34:17.666 --> 34:18.931
We were able to fix it.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.934
You mean he's gonna walk again?

34:20.936 --> 34:22.936
Yes.

34:22.938 --> 34:26.071
That's great news.

34:26.264 --> 34:29.275
Why-why aren't you acting
as though that's great news?

34:29.277 --> 34:32.145
Tracy, Russ'
full MRI results came in.

34:33.580 --> 34:35.380
Do you see that area right there?

34:35.382 --> 34:36.516
Uh-huh.

34:36.518 --> 34:39.985
That shows Russ has a shrunken hippocampus.

34:39.987 --> 34:41.853
I don't know what that means.

34:41.856 --> 34:45.223
We think he's exhibiting signs
of early-onset Alzheimer's.

34:47.860 --> 34:50.161
He's...

34:50.164 --> 34:51.728
he's only 43.

34:51.731 --> 34:54.299
We know this is a lot to
wrap your head around,

34:54.301 --> 34:57.101
but it could explain some
of Russ' erratic behavior.

35:04.108 --> 35:05.876
I need to see him.

35:05.878 --> 35:08.945
Yeah, of course.

35:13.786 --> 35:15.686
What is it?

35:19.623 --> 35:21.624
There's a storm.

35:21.626 --> 35:23.926
It's my neighbors.

35:23.928 --> 35:27.564
A huge electrical storm just rolled in.

35:27.566 --> 35:30.433
Flash floods.

35:30.435 --> 35:32.068
They say it came out of nowhere.

35:33.469 --> 35:35.370
Come on.

35:35.372 --> 35:38.139
I'll take you to him right now.

35:45.682 --> 35:48.083
Dr. Stroman.

35:48.085 --> 35:49.251
Dr. Reid.

35:49.253 --> 35:51.952
Heard you took my patient
on a little joyride.

35:51.954 --> 35:54.555
Just 20 minutes uptown
to pick up her daughter.

35:54.557 --> 35:56.990
We were never far from a
major medical facility.

35:56.992 --> 35:59.393
That supposed to make me feel better?

36:00.895 --> 36:02.763
Look...

36:02.765 --> 36:05.032
I think we should be helping
her to feel more hopeful.

36:05.034 --> 36:07.067
As her doctor, that's not my job.

36:07.069 --> 36:09.703
Well, as her friend, it is mine.

36:09.705 --> 36:13.540
And she's giving up. She's feeling trapped.

36:13.542 --> 36:15.908
I'm worried about her state of mind.

36:15.910 --> 36:20.079
Alex, you should probably
take a look at this.

36:20.081 --> 36:21.848
What am I looking at?

36:21.850 --> 36:24.916
Dana's latest P.E.T. scan results.

36:24.918 --> 36:26.552
They just came in.

36:37.049 --> 36:38.249
Hey.

36:38.648 --> 36:40.684
Where's Molly?

36:40.686 --> 36:41.819
She had to grab a bite.

36:41.821 --> 36:45.056
So, uh, are we going somewhere?

36:45.058 --> 36:46.390
Yeah.

36:46.392 --> 36:48.325
Radiology, unfortunately.

36:48.327 --> 36:51.094
Not another P.E.T. scan.

36:54.498 --> 36:56.399
Oh, joy.

36:56.401 --> 36:57.334
Buckle up.

37:01.439 --> 37:04.240
Have we moved radiology to the lobby?

37:04.242 --> 37:08.110
No, I'm taking you somewhere else.

37:08.112 --> 37:09.611
Oh, my.

37:09.613 --> 37:11.413
- Huh?
- Oh, Alex.

37:11.415 --> 37:13.983
You're taking me to the cottage.

37:13.985 --> 37:17.252
Hope Zion's inaugural cottage fest.

37:18.189 --> 37:20.289
- Mom.
- Oh, you total sneak.

37:20.291 --> 37:22.923
I can't believe you did all this.

37:22.925 --> 37:25.093
Well, we had some help.

37:25.095 --> 37:27.462
Oh, this is too much, really.

37:27.464 --> 37:28.629
No, it's not.

37:28.631 --> 37:31.299
We have something to celebrate.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.602
She's right.

37:34.604 --> 37:36.504
Uh, care to do the honors, Dr. Reid?

37:36.506 --> 37:38.973
I would love to.

37:38.975 --> 37:41.375
Your latest P.E.T. scan results...

37:43.411 --> 37:45.612
Dana, your tumor shrunk.

37:50.552 --> 37:52.185
Alex, I... that's...

37:52.187 --> 37:54.087
2.4 centimeters.

37:54.089 --> 37:55.989
Oh, down from 4.8.

37:55.991 --> 37:57.456
That's right.

37:57.458 --> 37:58.324
That's...

37:58.326 --> 37:59.591
And there's more.

37:59.593 --> 38:01.527
More good news?

38:01.529 --> 38:02.895
Oh, gosh.

38:02.897 --> 38:05.431
I don't think I can take
more good news today.

38:05.433 --> 38:07.133
Dana, you've been accepted into

38:07.135 --> 38:09.502
the latest trial at Sacred Mercy.

38:09.504 --> 38:11.437
Oh.

38:11.439 --> 38:14.372
Dr. Binari is experimenting with a new drug

38:14.374 --> 38:15.373
on breast-cancer patients.

38:15.375 --> 38:16.574
I sent him your latest scan.

38:16.576 --> 38:17.975
And I'm a candidate now?

38:17.977 --> 38:19.911
Yes, you and your obedient tumor.

38:20.780 --> 38:21.812
John.

38:21.814 --> 38:23.048
John, wow.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.849
If I had known
you were doing all of this,

38:24.851 --> 38:26.951
I never would have treated
you like such a fascist.

38:26.953 --> 38:27.818
Oh, yes, you would have.

38:28.788 --> 38:30.287
Don't stay up too late now.

38:30.289 --> 38:33.424
No. Thank you. Thank you, John.

38:35.194 --> 38:37.227
Well, let's get this
party started, shall we?

38:37.229 --> 38:38.862
You got it.

38:38.864 --> 38:41.565
Oh, sweetheart, this is amazing.

38:41.567 --> 38:42.799
- Hey.
- Hey, Charlie.

38:42.801 --> 38:45.302
Hey.

38:45.304 --> 38:47.870
So, I did it.

38:47.872 --> 38:49.272
What?

38:49.274 --> 38:51.474
That thing that
I think you were suggesting

38:51.476 --> 38:53.909
during our impromptu
debate club this morning.

38:53.911 --> 38:55.978
Really?

38:55.980 --> 38:58.814
Yeah, I, uh...
I spent the day without them.

38:58.816 --> 39:00.516
And?

39:00.518 --> 39:04.119
And it didn't go off without its hiccups,

39:04.121 --> 39:07.456
but, um... I got it done.

39:07.458 --> 39:08.690
No one died.

39:08.692 --> 39:12.127
So you'll talk to Shahir?
You'll book the surgery.

39:12.129 --> 39:13.095
I already did.

39:19.369 --> 39:21.768
You know, I didn't really
drop out of the debate club.

39:21.770 --> 39:25.339
I was booted out... unsportsmanlike conduct.

39:25.341 --> 39:27.841
I don't even want to know what
that looks like in debating.

39:28.844 --> 39:30.444
I'll show you later.

40:12.519 --> 40:14.018
Hey.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.587
Hey.

40:16.589 --> 40:18.656
How's our Jane Austen?

40:18.658 --> 40:20.124
She's gonna be just fine.

40:20.126 --> 40:22.993
Good.

40:24.429 --> 40:25.463
How are you?

40:28.099 --> 40:30.534
Zach, you can stop pitying me, okay?

40:30.536 --> 40:33.570
I'm moving on.

40:33.572 --> 40:36.173
That is so far
from how I feel about you, Dawn.

40:39.411 --> 40:41.844
Good.

40:41.846 --> 40:43.846
Great.

40:46.151 --> 40:47.883
I mean,
look how far you've come

40:47.885 --> 40:49.652
from bedbugs to chief of surgery.

40:51.922 --> 40:53.589
It's kind of too bad, though, actually.

40:53.591 --> 40:55.123
Oh, yeah, why's that?

40:55.125 --> 40:57.025
Well, it's just that

40:57.027 --> 40:58.661
person your friend was describing...

40:58.663 --> 40:59.695
Yeah?

41:01.532 --> 41:03.598
I'd drop off the grid for that woman.

41:08.671 --> 41:10.871
Hi.

41:10.873 --> 41:11.939
Hi.

41:11.941 --> 41:13.007
We did a good thing today.

41:13.009 --> 41:14.108
Yeah, we did.

41:14.110 --> 41:15.910
We saved a life, maybe even a marriage.

41:15.912 --> 41:19.214
Can I change my mind
about the tequila shots?

41:22.751 --> 41:24.518
I'm married.

41:28.022 --> 41:30.056
Barnes, McCarthy, and Lyons.

41:30.058 --> 41:31.291
Yeah.

41:31.293 --> 41:35.529
It's my wife...
or her lawyer, actually.

41:37.131 --> 41:40.199
It's getting a little messy.

41:40.201 --> 41:41.767
All the more reason for tequila.

41:41.769 --> 41:42.835
No kidding.

41:45.373 --> 41:48.207
Look, it's complicated.

41:50.878 --> 41:53.011
Deserve better than that.

41:55.115 --> 41:57.044
Okay, attention, everyone.

41:57.094 --> 41:58.515
Let's start the show.

41:58.518 --> 42:00.051
Lights, please.

42:00.053 --> 42:01.052
Let's make a wish for Dana.

42:02.789 --> 42:05.056
Thank you, darling.
