09:10.152 --> 09:11.723
I guess so.

09:14.625 --> 09:16.728
- Peanuts...
- Wait, just hold up.

09:17.527 --> 09:18.797
Where has your buffer been?

09:19.464 --> 09:21.561
I don't know.

09:22.166 --> 09:22.964
What happened?

09:22.964 --> 09:25.104
Nothing. He's just
being an asshole.

09:26.637 --> 09:28.204
- Okay.
- Yeah.

09:28.204 --> 09:29.804
Alright.

09:29.804 --> 09:32.341
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Alright. I'm gonna
get you some more wine.

09:32.341 --> 09:34.109
Thank you.

09:34.109 --> 09:35.510
Goddammit!

09:35.510 --> 09:36.945
- (dance music playing)
- (cheering)

09:36.945 --> 09:38.714
- (honking)
- I'm gettin' married!

09:38.714 --> 09:40.581
Tiffani:
Woo-hoo! I got titties!

09:40.581 --> 09:42.184
- Who needs titties?!
- (laughter)

09:42.184 --> 09:43.485
Freddie!

09:43.485 --> 09:44.920
- Here you go!
- Actually, okay,
I'll take 'em.

09:44.920 --> 09:47.623
- (laughter, chatter)
- You.

09:47.623 --> 09:50.425
All:
Titties! Titties! Titties!

09:50.425 --> 09:52.761
Where's my cruise director?
Come on!

09:52.761 --> 09:54.262
(on PA):
<i>Attention, passengers.</i>

09:54.262 --> 09:57.632
<i>Our first stop tonight
will be Finn's downtown. Okay,</i>

09:57.632 --> 09:59.134
<i>stretch your legs.
Warm up your pipes.</i>

09:59.134 --> 10:01.264
- Tiffani: Woo!
<i>- It's karaoke night!</i>

10:01.264 --> 10:03.505
- Let's fucking go!
- (screaming)

10:03.505 --> 10:06.141
Alright.
Everybody outta the pool!

10:06.141 --> 10:08.343
(cheering)

10:08.343 --> 10:10.278
- (laughing)
- (music stops)

10:10.278 --> 10:11.846
Hey. You doin' okay?

10:11.846 --> 10:14.750
- Oh, my God.
This party is epic!
- (both laugh)

10:14.750 --> 10:17.520
Oh, my God!
I can't get over Irma!

10:17.520 --> 10:18.954
I know. Nuts.

10:18.954 --> 10:20.221
How are you?

10:20.221 --> 10:22.791
Well, you know, I'm good.
If my friends are happy,

10:22.791 --> 10:25.164
I'm happy.
But they're not happy.

10:27.231 --> 10:29.264
I know. I'm sorry.

10:29.264 --> 10:30.633
I'm sorry that Sam's not here.

10:30.633 --> 10:32.467
Yeah. (sighs)

10:32.467 --> 10:34.369
I'm sorry, too,
but you know what?

10:34.369 --> 10:36.271
Tonight is just about fun.

10:36.271 --> 10:38.006
- Yes.
- But listen, Joel,

10:38.006 --> 10:40.942
I need you two back together
for the wedding, okay?

10:40.942 --> 10:42.711
Oh, my God,
we'll absolutely be there.

10:42.711 --> 10:44.279
I know you'll be there,

10:44.279 --> 10:45.548
but that's not
what I'm sayin'.

10:45.548 --> 10:47.119
You copy
what I'm sayin', right?

10:48.152 --> 10:49.552
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:49.552 --> 10:51.520
I just...

10:51.520 --> 10:53.155
I don't know what to do

10:53.155 --> 10:55.791
because she won't
answer my text.

10:55.791 --> 10:57.393
Look, I'm gonna grab
an ice cream with her

10:57.393 --> 10:58.694
tomorrow at Call Hall,

10:58.694 --> 11:00.428
and I'll get into it with her.

11:00.428 --> 11:02.364
But, in the meantime,
my buddy,

11:02.364 --> 11:04.899
- gonna buck up... Okay?
- Yes. Yes!

11:04.899 --> 11:07.402
Tomorrow's a new day,
but tonight,
we're gonna have fun.

11:07.402 --> 11:11.240
- Come on! Let's go!
- Okay, let's party.
Let's fucking party!

11:11.240 --> 11:14.275
♪ ♪

11:14.275 --> 11:18.013
(insects chirping)

11:18.013 --> 11:19.681
- (sighs)
- Are you already done?

11:19.681 --> 11:21.282
Yep. I was born for this shit.

11:21.282 --> 11:23.853
- Tricia: That was fast.
- You need anything else?

11:23.853 --> 11:25.987
Um, no, I think
I'm good. Thanks.

11:25.987 --> 11:27.417
Great.

11:27.417 --> 11:28.924
Um, so how did
the jacket turn out?

11:28.924 --> 11:30.593
Oh, I haven't tried it on yet.

11:30.593 --> 11:32.160
Well, let's try it on.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.895
No, no, no.
It's packed up nice
in its bag.

11:33.895 --> 11:36.564
- I'll do it later.
- Come on, I have to make
sure that everything's perfect

11:36.564 --> 11:40.363
for Fred and Susan anyway,
so let's just give it a whirl.

11:40.363 --> 11:41.537
- Oh yeah.
- Yeah! Looks great!

11:41.537 --> 11:42.738
(both laugh)

11:42.738 --> 11:44.409
Right, that arm.

11:45.076 --> 11:45.841
Okay.

11:45.841 --> 11:47.777
- Got it?
- Mm-hmm.

11:47.777 --> 11:50.145
Um, I really appreciate you,

11:50.145 --> 11:53.581
- you know,
trusting me with your friends.
- Hm.

11:53.581 --> 11:56.421
I didn't do anything.
It was all you.

11:57.422 --> 11:59.149
How does it feel?

11:59.149 --> 12:00.325
(Sam clears throat)

12:02.593 --> 12:04.125
Something feels a little off.

12:04.125 --> 12:06.098
Mm-hmm. Um...

12:07.499 --> 12:08.463
It's bad, isn't it?

12:08.463 --> 12:11.503
- (both laughing)
- It's so bad!

12:12.804 --> 12:14.069
Sorry.
I'm sorry, but it...

12:14.069 --> 12:16.505
There-- There's
just an issue or two.

12:16.505 --> 12:18.573
I think with the...
(laughs)

12:18.573 --> 12:19.942
I don't understand.
He spent, like,

12:19.942 --> 12:21.676
30 minutes
on my chest alone.

12:21.676 --> 12:23.044
How could he have
gotten it so wrong?

12:23.044 --> 12:24.913
- (both laugh)
- Do I look like a linebacker?

12:24.913 --> 12:26.281
I don't wanna look
like a linebacker.

12:26.281 --> 12:29.885
- You look
linebacker adjacent.
- (both laugh)

12:29.885 --> 12:31.754
Those shoulders,
it looks like...

12:31.754 --> 12:33.556
What's the dance?
The '80s dance that...

12:33.556 --> 12:36.125
(both laughing)

12:36.125 --> 12:37.493
Oh God!

12:37.493 --> 12:38.827
- Okay.
- Um...

12:38.827 --> 12:40.556
(sighs)
What are we gonna do?

12:40.556 --> 12:42.598
Well, lucky for you,
I can sew my face off,

12:42.598 --> 12:43.999
and we're gonna
make this work.

12:43.999 --> 12:46.401
- Okay. Can you...
- (sighs)

12:46.401 --> 12:49.137
- put my tits in
their final resting place?
- (laughs) I can't do--

12:49.137 --> 12:51.941
- I can't help you
with that part.
- I mean...

12:51.941 --> 12:55.345
- my tits weren't
even here in the '90s.
- (laughs)

12:55.345 --> 12:58.381

13:36.552 --> 13:38.120
<i>Oh, my God, we are raging.</i>

13:38.120 --> 13:40.655
<i>I miss you!
We all miss you so much!</i>

13:40.655 --> 13:43.491
<i>Irma is on
a fucking rampage!
She's going nuts!</i>

13:43.491 --> 13:45.661
<i>Hey, I can't wait--
I can't wait
for ice cream tomorrow.</i>

13:45.661 --> 13:47.296
<i>I love you.
We love you. Shit,</i>

13:47.296 --> 13:50.400
<i>I gotta go, I gotta go.
Hold on, I gotta go.
Irma! Get down--</i>

Sam:
<i>Okay, well, you gotta tell me,</i>

14:01.943 --> 14:03.812
<i>what did I miss last night?</i>

14:03.812 --> 14:05.980
Irma was doing body shots
at Rock-A-Belly.

14:05.980 --> 14:08.317
- Oh, that bitch.
- And Larry, in
the Grains Department,

14:08.317 --> 14:10.486
was mooning people
outta the back
of the Growler.

14:10.486 --> 14:11.887
(laughing) Oh no!

14:11.887 --> 14:13.255
Right?
I threw my back out.

14:13.255 --> 14:15.023
Tiffani had, like,
these blow-up...

14:15.023 --> 14:17.125
Like, it-it--
They weren't, like,
two sets of boobs.

14:17.125 --> 14:19.660
They were like
blow-up beach balls
that had nipples on 'em.

14:19.660 --> 14:22.832
- I didn't bring 'em!
Of course, she did, right?
- (laughing)

14:22.832 --> 14:24.900
Oh, man.
It-It was totally crazy.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.136
- We missed you, Sam.
- Oh, my God. Yeah, well,

14:27.136 --> 14:29.638
- shit, sounds like
a great night.
- Oh, yeah.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.139
And, uh, I did talk to Joel,

14:31.139 --> 14:33.742
a-and, you know,
he misses you.

14:33.742 --> 14:35.143
(mouthing)

14:35.143 --> 14:36.511
We don't need to talk
about that right now.

14:36.511 --> 14:39.748
Alright. Well, forget
about Joel for a minute.

14:39.748 --> 14:41.783
- Okay.
Let's forget about Joel.
- Sammy...

14:41.783 --> 14:43.752
- I miss ya.
- (sighs)

14:43.752 --> 14:45.921
You mean a lot to me.

14:45.921 --> 14:47.222
Families aren't easy.

14:47.222 --> 14:48.957
Not even the fun ones, okay?

14:48.957 --> 14:50.996
It just--
It takes a lot of work.

14:52.830 --> 14:53.962
You know, you just gotta...

14:53.962 --> 14:56.001
You gotta decide
what's important to you.

15:00.171 --> 15:01.970
(sighs)

15:01.970 --> 15:03.672
And I know what's important
to me right now.

15:03.672 --> 15:04.739
What?

15:04.739 --> 15:06.942
I think I'm ready for
another round of ice cream.

15:06.942 --> 15:08.476
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- I know.

15:08.476 --> 15:09.911
- Alright, well--
- I'm gonna have a minty one.

15:09.911 --> 15:11.179
What do you want?

15:11.179 --> 15:14.116
I think I can
choke down one more.
Maybe a...

15:14.116 --> 15:16.218
butter brickle, butter pecan.
Surprise me.

15:16.218 --> 15:19.422
- Alright! It's on me. I got it.
- Okay, thanks. (laughs)

15:19.422 --> 15:20.592
Joel:
Hey.

15:22.427 --> 15:23.462
Hey, Joel.

15:25.062 --> 15:27.529
What is this?

15:27.529 --> 15:29.634
Is this some kind of
ambush or something?

15:30.868 --> 15:32.835
- No.
- Are you fucking
kidding me?

15:32.835 --> 15:34.604
Hey, I-I'm just
as surprised as you are.

15:34.604 --> 15:36.104
He didn't know. I...

15:36.104 --> 15:38.506
- I didn't.
- (sighs) You won't
talk to me alone.

15:38.506 --> 15:41.013
I thought maybe
you'd talk to me
with Fred around.

15:41.779 --> 15:43.278
Okay, well, I'm here.

15:43.278 --> 15:47.049
- What do you wanna talk about?
- (Joel laughs awkwardly)

15:47.049 --> 15:49.354
I don't know what
to say. (laughs)

15:50.488 --> 15:53.058
I just needed to talk
to you. I-I miss you.

15:54.993 --> 15:56.424
I know it was
an asshole move,

15:56.424 --> 15:58.730
- sending that steps text.
- Yeah, you think?

16:00.698 --> 16:02.334
Joel:
I'm just trying.

16:04.302 --> 16:05.667
I-I lied--

16:05.667 --> 16:07.639
Stop! Stop.

16:08.873 --> 16:11.376
- It was a mistake.
- I'm so...

16:12.176 --> 16:14.309
I'm so mad at you, Joel,

16:14.309 --> 16:17.682
and I don't wanna be,
but I can't help it.

16:18.983 --> 16:20.783
I'm sorry, Sam.

16:20.783 --> 16:22.517
You have a...

16:22.517 --> 16:24.720
a fucking boyfriend,
and you don't think
I can handle it,

16:24.720 --> 16:26.388
so you just don't tell me?

16:26.388 --> 16:28.056
- Sam--
- Do you have any idea

16:28.056 --> 16:30.195
how stupid
that makes me feel?!

16:32.363 --> 16:35.698
- I'm sorry.
- Why doesn't anybody think
I can handle anything?

16:35.698 --> 16:37.402
I can handle it!

16:39.103 --> 16:41.103
God, first my sister,
and now you.

16:41.103 --> 16:43.205
- Wait, what happened
with your sister?
- No!

16:43.205 --> 16:45.110
You don't get to know!

16:46.876 --> 16:50.178
God, maybe I wouldn't
have been okay.
Okay, fine.

16:50.178 --> 16:51.813
But I thought that we had
the kind of relationship

16:51.813 --> 16:54.750
that if there was something
that was that important to you

16:54.750 --> 16:56.151
that you would want me to know!

16:56.151 --> 16:57.620
That you would
wanna share it with me!

16:57.620 --> 16:59.053
But you didn't, did you?!

16:59.053 --> 17:01.624
- We do have that
kind of relationship!
- No, you're keeping secrets,

17:01.624 --> 17:02.624
and I don't want secrets!

17:02.624 --> 17:04.226
I just didn't think
you would understand!

17:04.226 --> 17:06.131
Oh, understand what, Joel?

17:07.866 --> 17:09.198
What?!

17:09.198 --> 17:12.896
I do love what
we have together, but...

17:12.896 --> 17:14.636
we can't provide
everything for each other!

17:14.636 --> 17:15.899
Oh, my God!

17:15.899 --> 17:19.241
I don't want you
to be my boyfriend, Joel!

17:19.241 --> 17:21.546
I just don't
want you to leave me!

17:23.609 --> 17:24.580
I'm not going anywhere.

17:24.580 --> 17:26.685
Oh... (exhales)

17:28.519 --> 17:31.356
Well, it can't be
the same now.

17:33.691 --> 17:35.327
It's not gonna be the same.

17:37.829 --> 17:41.133
No. I guess not.

17:42.801 --> 17:44.236
So...

17:45.569 --> 17:48.307
Now, we talked, okay?
Are you happy?

17:49.441 --> 17:51.440
No. (gasps)

17:51.440 --> 17:52.744
I'm sorry.

17:53.578 --> 17:55.247
Fuck. Fuck.

17:55.880 --> 17:57.516
Fuck. Fuck!

17:58.750 --> 18:00.385
(deep sigh)

18:06.157 --> 18:07.692
Hey, you okay?

18:09.126 --> 18:11.060
- Sam: No.
- Wanna hug?

18:11.060 --> 18:13.232
(sighing) No.

18:14.898 --> 18:17.699
Fred:
Alright. I'm gonna
get your ice cream.

18:17.699 --> 18:18.803
Alright.

18:21.806 --> 18:24.843
(birds chirping)

18:30.682 --> 18:33.718

18:37.154 --> 18:38.790
(brakes squeal)

18:48.265 --> 18:49.631
(dog barking)

19:49.593 --> 19:51.994
I wanted to say something
