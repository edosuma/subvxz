WEBVTT

00:07.007 --> 00:08.800
Yeah. Well, we're starting where...

00:08.884 --> 00:10.928
You get up and he comes, you know, back.

00:20.312 --> 00:22.397
KIM RICHARDS:
All right, guys and girls. Good morning!

00:22.481 --> 00:24.816
Welcome to season two of <i>Huckleberry.</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:27.152
-Welcome back! Yes.
-(CREW MEMBERS CHEERING)

00:27.236 --> 00:29.321
Welcome back,
or welcome for the first time.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.614
<i>I'm Kim. I'm the First AD...</i>

00:30.697 --> 00:33.909
(CROWD CHEERS)

00:33.992 --> 00:37.079
Season two! Yeah!

00:41.583 --> 00:42.584
That's great.

00:42.668 --> 00:44.503
-What's your name?
-My name's Kayden.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.463
-Like Hayden?
-Of course.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.298
MAN: All right, here we go.
Lock it up, please.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.384

00:53.095 --> 00:54.680
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

00:58.100 --> 01:00.477
JON FAVREAU: Welcome,
everybody, back to the show.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.896
We're gonna have
a lot of beats of fighting

01:02.980 --> 01:05.607
<i>with a lot of characters</i>
<i>running in from different places,</i>

01:05.691 --> 01:08.068
<i>a lot of choreography going on...</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:11.196
Take a couple of steps,
and then lean into it.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.281
(WOMAN LAUGHS)

01:14.825 --> 01:17.744
Season two...
You're walking into a world.

01:17.828 --> 01:21.123
<i>They're bringing these characters to life.</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:24.042
<i>Feels really exciting, it's electric.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.837
For season two,
what everyone is after,

01:26.920 --> 01:30.215
but what is important to me
is making people care,

01:30.299 --> 01:33.302
<i>to create new things,</i>
<i>and to introduce new characters,</i>

01:33.385 --> 01:34.761
<i>and to go to new planets,</i>

01:34.845 --> 01:37.806
<i>while preserving all of</i>
<i>this incredible nostalgia that we have</i>

01:37.890 --> 01:41.268
for every aspect of <i>Star Wars</i>
that people wanna see.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.521
I think we all like this aesthetic
more for Boba Fett.

01:44.605 --> 01:46.690
FAVREAU:<i> Right.</i>
FILONI:<i> That's what we know him as.</i>

01:46.815 --> 01:49.568
In season one, once you've set up,
"This is what the show is,"

01:49.651 --> 01:51.653
<i>you're always open</i>
<i>to have a little more fun,</i>

01:51.737 --> 01:56.158
<i>and yet still deepen the whole experience</i>
<i>for the character and the viewer.</i>

02:05.626 --> 02:08.003
FILONI: That really winds up.
ROTH: Winds up really well.

02:08.086 --> 02:09.254
AMY SEDARIS: Maybe I'm in here?

02:09.338 --> 02:11.089
You're just curious about the small tip.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.674
ROY CANCINO: Clear the hole.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.303
Can everybody see me good enough? Okay.

02:16.386 --> 02:19.723
So, the scene starts...

02:19.806 --> 02:23.769
This is coming after a few establishing
shots of the spaceship flying around,

02:23.852 --> 02:27.564
so this is at Hangar 35,
which is, I think, a few hangars down

02:27.648 --> 02:31.193
from where the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
used to get gassed up.

02:31.276 --> 02:32.444
-(SEDARIS SNICKERS)
-It's good.

02:32.528 --> 02:33.529
-(LAUGHS)
-That was good.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.324
Of course, as you know, with Amy,
we might get off road a little bit.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.575
Let's be prepared for that.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.160
-Encourage creativity.
-(LAUGHTER)

02:42.955 --> 02:43.997
For episode one,

02:44.081 --> 02:46.625
I loved working with Jon as a director.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.212
<i>He knows what he wants,</i>
<i>he loves working with the actors...</i>

02:50.587 --> 02:53.632
He backs off, you back off,
it doesn't jump off at that point.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.177
At that point, you're looking
what the hell's going on, and I love...

02:57.261 --> 02:59.555
-So this is where you get the Leone stuff.
-Exactly.

02:59.638 --> 03:02.891
Camera pushes in, you see the bombs,
you see the head moving around...

03:02.975 --> 03:05.894
This is as close as we can get
without him getting able to do it,

03:05.978 --> 03:08.480
so it looks like, if he moved or let go,

03:08.564 --> 03:10.732
it would run off,
and the thing would go under.

03:10.816 --> 03:12.317
BRENDAN WAYNE:
<i>He knows to tell stories.</i>

03:12.401 --> 03:13.819
He understands bigger picture,

03:13.902 --> 03:16.488
which usually you get people
who get caught up in moments

03:16.572 --> 03:18.866
<i>and hope that this thing falls together.</i>

03:18.949 --> 03:20.033
Waiting...

03:20.117 --> 03:21.577
WAYNE: <i>That's the actors' job.</i>

03:21.660 --> 03:23.120
<i>We gotta catch our moments.</i>

03:23.203 --> 03:24.413
He catches the story.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.459
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

03:29.543 --> 03:32.963
The first season,
I wanted to make sure that I was available

03:33.046 --> 03:35.632
to oversee the whole show
as an executive producer,

03:35.716 --> 03:40.262
<i>but I always wanted to sit in the chair</i>
<i>and be able to just interface directly,</i>

03:40.345 --> 03:42.973
<i>and try things</i>
<i>that may have been too ambitious</i>

03:43.056 --> 03:45.392
<i>for somebody who didn't know</i>
<i>the show as well as I did,</i>

03:45.475 --> 03:47.561
so I was able to throw myself
a lot of curveballs.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.564
Just gonna... (CHUCKLES)

03:56.612 --> 03:58.113
(ROARING)

04:04.369 --> 04:07.289
The krayt dragon
is a great example of Jon

04:07.372 --> 04:11.543
once again taking something from
the original films that's obscure,

04:11.627 --> 04:14.254
<i>and then elevating it</i>
<i>to be this big centerpiece.</i>

04:19.885 --> 04:23.805
<i>So, taking something we only glimpsed</i>
<i>as bones in </i>New Hope,

04:23.889 --> 04:27.559
<i>and fleshing it out, and making it</i>
<i>into the big, bad creature of episode one</i>

04:27.643 --> 04:30.979
and then Doug's group
did an amazing job of designing the thing

04:31.063 --> 04:34.233
and figuring out what does this thing
look like when it's in its prime?

04:36.443 --> 04:38.820
DOUG CHIANG:<i> It was a huge challenge,</i>
<i>'cause Jon raised the bar</i>

04:38.904 --> 04:40.197
<i>in terms of design.</i>

04:40.280 --> 04:43.033
He challenged us
to really come up with a spectacle

04:43.116 --> 04:46.036
that would fit within the box
of what we were given.

04:46.119 --> 04:49.456
<i>We saw skeletons of it.</i>
<i>It was just the head and the neck.</i>

04:49.540 --> 04:51.792
How do we extrapolate that
to create our dragon?

04:53.877 --> 04:55.712
<i>And one of the fun design ideas was that,</i>

04:55.796 --> 04:58.465
<i>"Okay, maybe as it evolves,</i>
<i>it actually grows limbs,</i>

04:58.549 --> 05:00.968
<i>"and so, the older it gets,</i>
<i>the more limbs it has."</i>

05:01.802 --> 05:04.555
<i>That, then, gave us the license</i>
<i>to really expand on that.</i>

05:04.638 --> 05:06.473
<i>"Let's push the scale,</i>
<i>let's push the drama,</i>

05:06.557 --> 05:09.351
<i>"let's go for the scope in the spectacle</i>
<i>of what Jon was writing</i>

05:09.434 --> 05:11.228
"and see where the boundaries were."

05:11.311 --> 05:15.440
<i>The dragon actually came out</i>
<i>to be pretty big when Jon approved it.</i>

05:15.524 --> 05:16.900
<i>It was 150 feet.</i>

05:16.984 --> 05:20.404
<i>And then, once Jon got in there</i>
<i>and started to look at layout shots,</i>

05:20.487 --> 05:21.697
<i>it grew even bigger.</i>

05:21.780 --> 05:24.700
When we started
looking at him in the environment,

05:24.783 --> 05:26.827
he didn't really look that imposing,

05:26.910 --> 05:28.829
<i>so we just started scaling him up,</i>

05:28.912 --> 05:32.583
and he became 600 feet long,
and Jon said, "That looks right."

05:32.666 --> 05:34.751
HICKEL:<i> And then,</i>
<i>from an animation standpoint,</i>

05:34.835 --> 05:36.920
<i>how is it pushing itself</i>
<i>through the earth?</i>

05:37.004 --> 05:41.592
So we came up with a scheme where
it's liquefying the sand around it

05:41.675 --> 05:43.719
<i>with some kind of</i>
<i>sound wave or something,</i>

05:43.802 --> 05:45.345
<i>so that it can swim through the sand.</i>

05:45.429 --> 05:46.972
It's all, you know, hidden.

05:47.055 --> 05:49.766
<i>It's all sleight of hand</i>
<i>because we never see the full dragon,</i>

05:49.850 --> 05:51.059
<i>it's always hidden,</i>

05:51.143 --> 05:53.187
<i>and it's kind of like the shark in </i>Jaws.

05:53.270 --> 05:55.355
<i>The less you reveal of it,</i>
<i>the better it is,</i>

05:55.439 --> 05:57.524
the more mysterious,
powerful the design is.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.989
We're at the entrance,
right now, of the Volume,

06:04.114 --> 06:06.116
and as I write things
and we design environments,

06:06.200 --> 06:08.827
I try to think of what we could
try different in this space.

06:08.911 --> 06:12.164
We've done exteriors, we've done caverns,
we've done ice tunnels...

06:13.874 --> 06:16.627
<i>We've used it for a lot. Here</i>
<i>was an opportunity to try something</i>

06:16.710 --> 06:20.130
that was an underground arena
that would've been prohibitive to build.

06:22.758 --> 06:26.011
Season two, technically,
the Volume changed, it became bigger.

06:26.094 --> 06:29.473
<i>It's about a hundred feet long</i>
<i>and 22 feet tall.</i>

06:29.556 --> 06:33.560
<i>We had phenomenal new</i>
<i>color management science from ILM</i>

06:33.644 --> 06:37.147
<i>in regards to the way the pixels</i>
<i>were being driven to the screen.</i>

06:37.940 --> 06:41.193
MAN: I'm basically moving
the entire sky world around

06:41.276 --> 06:43.487
to find a better composition in frame.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.785
We also could shoot
much more lower light scenes,

06:49.868 --> 06:52.371
<i>much darker scenes, which was phenomenal.</i>

06:58.418 --> 07:00.170
FAVREAU: Wanna look at the artwork here?

07:00.254 --> 07:02.172
SIMON KASSIANIDES: Absolutely.
MAN: Yeah.

07:08.262 --> 07:09.471
I drew that one up there.

07:10.222 --> 07:13.809
My son watched me.
My son was in here painting, too. He's 18.

07:13.892 --> 07:14.893
What?

07:14.977 --> 07:17.980
I'm like... (MAKES SWISHING SOUND)
He's said, "You've done this before, Dad."

07:18.063 --> 07:19.815
-I'm like... "I don't know."
-Oh, yeah.

07:19.898 --> 07:23.110
FAVREAU:<i> I really loved the exterior,</i>
<i>because the artist, David Choe,</i>

07:23.193 --> 07:25.195
<i>he started off doing graffiti art,</i>

07:25.279 --> 07:27.573
<i>and he asked me,</i>
<i>"How come there's no graffiti?"</i>

07:27.656 --> 07:29.199
<i>There was in animation.</i>

07:29.283 --> 07:30.450
<i>And I said, "There could be,</i>

07:30.534 --> 07:32.953
"and I'm getting ready to direct one,
you wanna come down?"

07:33.036 --> 07:37.374
And so, David Choe painted
all the exteriors on the set.

07:52.347 --> 07:54.558
FAVREAU: He said that
it was about layering, right?

07:54.641 --> 07:56.643
CHOE: Yeah.
FAVREAU: Graffiti's about layering.

07:56.727 --> 07:59.771
You don't wanna make it like a mural.
You want it to look like...

07:59.855 --> 08:01.815
-generations of graffiti.
-CHOE: Right.

08:03.483 --> 08:06.653
I like the level of nerdiness
we've put into this.

08:06.737 --> 08:07.738
FAVREAU: Yes.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.241
We left a lot of the low graffiti
for the Jawas...

08:11.325 --> 08:12.910
(FAVREAU CHUCKLES)

08:12.993 --> 08:14.620
'cause they can't reach that high.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.168
FAVREAU: That's a living piece of art.

08:22.044 --> 08:26.089
It's for me to live out
all my childhood fantasies,

08:26.173 --> 08:28.467
and just... I mean, it's a win-win,

08:28.550 --> 08:31.136
and Jon stole me in for a second
as an alien.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.066
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

08:50.489 --> 08:51.823
Did a little bit of a trench

08:52.616 --> 08:55.994
so that you can
snip it down below level,

08:56.078 --> 08:58.497
and then when you do
your cavel over it, it just...

08:58.580 --> 08:59.831
-So that way, you know?
-Yeah.

08:59.915 --> 09:01.458
You're not building on a hump.

09:01.542 --> 09:03.752
-You're building in a valley.
-Yes, yes.

09:03.836 --> 09:05.587
<i>One nice, big thing the production did</i>

09:05.671 --> 09:07.673
was they opened up a little room for us,

09:07.756 --> 09:10.133
so that we can actually build
a lot of stuff here on site.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.595
<i>Kind of opening up</i>
<i>that old ILM creature shop again</i>

09:13.679 --> 09:15.055
<i>to build the </i>Star Wars <i>aliens.</i>

09:15.138 --> 09:16.557
(INAUDIBLE CONVERSATION)

09:16.640 --> 09:20.143
<i>The director, Dave, and Jon,</i>
<i>input comes from all three,</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:23.981
<i>and then we go and we try and interpret</i>
<i>that into the best form that we can</i>

09:24.064 --> 09:27.150
for a makeup that might fit a person,
or work well as a makeup.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.627
Being one of the departments
that deal with practical elements,

09:45.711 --> 09:49.756
<i>we're always kind of making sure that</i>
<i>what we do blends in with the background,</i>

09:49.840 --> 09:53.010
<i>especially having the Volume,</i>
<i>so we have a visual that we can match,</i>

09:53.093 --> 09:55.220
<i>and making sure</i>
<i>that our textures and everything</i>

09:55.304 --> 09:57.222
<i>match with the costumes</i>
<i>and all that stuff,</i>

09:57.306 --> 09:59.349
so you get to see
that really cool mixture.

10:04.730 --> 10:06.481
You're gonna see.
They're about to come in.

10:06.565 --> 10:08.025
They're two Gamorreans.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.987
So, I don't know if you know <i>Star Wars,</i>
but they're green pig guys

10:12.070 --> 10:15.949
that are in here fighting to the death.
This is, like, deathmatch, all right?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.619
So, all you guys, I know
that rehearsal was kind of weird,

10:18.702 --> 10:20.370
'cause you had nothing to act against,

10:20.454 --> 10:23.040
but on the day, there's gonna be
two pig guys in here fighting,

10:23.123 --> 10:25.501
so use that to feed off your energy.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.004
And again, this is really about you guys
in here all day, today and tomorrow.

10:29.087 --> 10:30.839
So really, really good energy.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.425
First team's gonna come in
and shoot this thing, all right?

10:33.509 --> 10:35.177
(CROWD CHEERING)

10:35.260 --> 10:38.889
On this episode, we discussed all styles
of fighting from all over the galaxy.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.892
<i>The pig guys have a certain style,</i>
<i>they're really, you know,</i>

10:41.975 --> 10:43.769
<i>not the most finessed</i>
<i>or beautiful movement,</i>

10:43.852 --> 10:46.230
but they were strong and a little clumsy.
(CHUCKLES)

10:47.523 --> 10:49.566
They're a little leaner,
the fighting Gamorreans

10:49.650 --> 10:52.444
<i>as opposed to the heftier Gamorrean guards</i>
<i>from Jabba's palace.</i>

10:52.528 --> 10:54.863
(BOTH GRUNTING)

10:57.783 --> 10:59.576
We made them a Gamorrean axe.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.496
So this is an aluminum...
It's a hollow fighting axe,

11:02.579 --> 11:04.873
and then we added
a couple of little details,

11:04.957 --> 11:07.209
so it has electricity,
so when they're fighting,

11:07.292 --> 11:08.377
<i>you can see sparks.</i>

11:08.460 --> 11:11.129
(SPECTATORS CHEERING)

11:11.213 --> 11:13.173
FAVREAU:<i> I like the idea of people</i>
<i>just watching</i>

11:13.257 --> 11:16.969
a Muay Thai fighter-fight club type thing
or a gambling venue,

11:17.052 --> 11:19.388
<i>where he was visiting, like, a mob boss.</i>

11:19.471 --> 11:21.974
<i>Because with</i> Star Wars,
<i>you can lean into different genres.</i>

11:22.057 --> 11:23.642
We've had Western, Samurai,

11:23.725 --> 11:25.978

the spider that lived on Dagobah.

Peyton has a great sensibility for humor

that's the hallmark of <i>Star Wars</i> action,

And Bo-Katan was voiced by Katee Sackhoff

21:46.181 --> 21:49.101
<i>in</i> Clone Wars, <i>in</i> Rebels,

21:49.184 --> 21:51.186
<i>and when I first read my script,</i>

21:51.270 --> 21:52.896
when I saw Bo-Katan, I was like,

21:52.980 --> 21:56.942
"Oh, my gosh, that's Katee Sackhoff.
(GASPS) Is it gonna be Katee Sackhoff?"

21:58.318 --> 22:02.906
<i>It was so thrilling to get to bring</i>
<i>that character to life with Katee.</i>

22:02.990 --> 22:05.242
<i>Especially because</i>
<i>Katee has that expertise,</i>

22:05.325 --> 22:07.953
<i>because she's been playing</i>
<i>the character for almost 10 years.</i>

22:08.036 --> 22:11.206
This is her first day
as Bo-Katan live action.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.543
We've been animated Mandalorians before.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.503
Never been
in the same place at the same time.

22:16.587 --> 22:17.629
Never in the same place.

22:17.713 --> 22:20.007
-But we've done a lot of scenes together.
-A ton.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.969
FILONI: <i>Years ago,</i>
<i>when she first started, I said,</i>

22:24.052 --> 22:27.389
"You never know. This works out,
this could become live action one day."

22:27.472 --> 22:31.768
And she's like, "Okay. Great, Dave.
That's great. I'm sure."

22:32.477 --> 22:36.023
<i>And so, when she showed up on set</i>
<i>and she's wearing the full outfit,</i>

22:36.106 --> 22:38.233
<i>carrying her helmet,</i>
<i>she just looked at me like,</i>

22:38.317 --> 22:41.445
"I can't believe you said
this would happen, and it's happening."

22:41.528 --> 22:42.946
I'm like, "I know. Isn't it cool?"

22:43.030 --> 22:46.909
<i>She's so great at playing</i>
<i>these type of gunslinger characters</i>

22:46.992 --> 22:49.119
<i>and she just is Bo-Katan to me.</i>

22:51.580 --> 22:55.584
FAVREAU:<i> Mercedes, or she's known</i>
<i>as Sasha Banks</i><i>in her wrestling career,</i>

22:55.667 --> 22:58.837
<i>clearly her persona had a lot of flair,</i>

22:58.921 --> 23:01.882
<i>and I thought</i>
<i>it's really good for this show</i>

23:01.965 --> 23:06.845
<i>to have somebody playing a Mandalorian</i>
<i>who had all of that fierceness,</i>

23:06.929 --> 23:10.390
<i>and the energy, and also physicality.</i>

23:10.474 --> 23:13.227
<i>Because when you're</i>
<i>breaking a new character in,</i>

23:13.310 --> 23:18.357
<i>that doesn't have any roots or history</i>
<i>in any of the other </i>Star Wars<i> media,</i>

23:18.440 --> 23:20.108
<i>you wanna make a strong impression.</i>

23:23.403 --> 23:30.244
Because it was an episode about Mando
seeing other Mandalorians in action,

23:30.327 --> 23:33.539
it was essential that
we delivered on that end.

23:34.998 --> 23:36.250
(LAUGHS)

23:36.333 --> 23:41.505
HOWARD: <i>Mando's here,</i>
<i>and you come over to Mando.</i>

23:41.588 --> 23:45.008
Have look at that
with the pattern fire in Lucas movement.

23:45.092 --> 23:48.637
And then he's gonna be reaching
the classic <i>Star Wars</i> pew-pew battle.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.888
-Then hide.
-Okay, let's see it.

23:49.972 --> 23:51.223
-That's my only trying to get away from.
-Let's see.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.724
Just an idea that was in my head,

23:52.808 --> 23:54.685
but this might evolve
into something cooler.

23:54.768 --> 23:56.895
If you see it and hate it,
we'll do it that way.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.021
FAVREAU:<i> All right, good.</i>

23:58.105 --> 24:00.357
SACKHOFF: Fire, fire. Three, four.

24:00.440 --> 24:01.483
PASCAL: <i>Five.</i>

24:01.567 --> 24:03.819
FAVREAU: <i>If he sneaks in and shoots,</i>
<i>he's part of the crew.</i>

24:03.902 --> 24:04.987
<i>So, I think...</i>

24:05.070 --> 24:07.114
-When they're shooting, he's not.
-Right.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.366
FAVREAU: <i>We should try one that way.</i>

24:09.449 --> 24:12.160
MAN: <i>When he tries to sneak away?</i>
FAVREAU: <i>Pattern... He does.</i>

24:12.244 --> 24:14.580
When they go pattern fire,
and they rush in.

24:14.663 --> 24:16.164
They all go, at the same time.

24:16.248 --> 24:18.125
If he's with them,
he's part of that crew.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.710
MAN: <i>You wanna separate him from the crew?</i>

24:19.793 --> 24:20.919
FAVREAU: <i>He shouldn't be ready.</i>

24:21.003 --> 24:23.046
When they jump out,
they're a machine. He's not.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.763
I have so much fun
on the set of<i> Mandalorian.</i>

24:31.847 --> 24:35.809
<i>It's just the most incredible group of</i>

24:35.893 --> 24:40.272

24:40.981 --> 24:43.901
<i>and all of us are obsessed with </i>Star Wars.

24:43.984 --> 24:47.446
We're basically all
like six-year-olds in our backyard,

<i>like, playing</i> Star Wars<i> with one another.</i>

24:50.657 --> 24:53.243

<i>where I was having the most fun</i>

24:53.994 --> 24:59.041
<i>was when it was just me, Jon, and Dave,</i>
<i>and it was just so great.</i>

24:59.124 --> 25:01.418
It was so much fun.

25:02.419 --> 25:06.423
And if you can reach into your pocket,
and you're gonna leave some.

25:07.049 --> 25:10.469

Could she pay the check?

25:10.594 --> 25:11.720

<i>to her early,</i>

25:24.691 --> 25:27.444
hold your reaction until she's here.

Right? So cameras can see you,
and then come back to her.

25:30.447 --> 25:32.908
Let's try it one more time.

25:32.991 --> 25:35.619
Carl Weathers came back
to act again as Greef Karga,

25:35.702 --> 25:39.373
but also to direct episode four,
which is a rollicking adventure ride.

25:39.456 --> 25:44.419
I think having that first season
under our belts gave us a sense of

25:45.504 --> 25:49.299
the flow of the show,
and the flow of the stories.

25:49.383 --> 25:52.135
<i>The more I got into it,</i>
<i>the more I was able to</i>

25:53.428 --> 25:56.598
<i>sort of wear my actor hat</i>
<i>when I'm in the scene</i>

25:57.349 --> 26:02.145
and still be aware of, wherever camera
was set, what we were seeing.

26:02.563 --> 26:04.189
PASCAL: <i>It's an incredible episode.</i>

26:04.273 --> 26:05.607
I'm so proud of Carl,

26:05.691 --> 26:09.695

was how great the action is.

26:12.573 --> 26:14.616
WATSON: <i>Carl really understands action.</i>

26:15.200 --> 26:17.703
Working with him was awesome.
He added another take on it.

26:17.786 --> 26:19.705
For stunt guys,
it's great to have a director

26:19.788 --> 26:23.458
<i>that has physicality</i>
<i>and knowledge of physicality in film.</i>

26:23.542 --> 26:25.711
WEATHERS: <i>Regarding the action</i>
<i>in particular,</i>

26:25.794 --> 26:29.298
that's something I've done
in front of the camera forever. (LAUGHS)

26:29.381 --> 26:32.926
And then, of course, I was an athlete
before that, a professional athlete.

26:33.010 --> 26:35.971
So I know how it feels to get hit,

26:36.054 --> 26:39.391
<i>and I know how it feels</i>
<i>when you're inside a scene,</i>

26:39.474 --> 26:41.310
and it's moving and doing certain things.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.688
Bang. Camera goes here,
sees me come in.

26:45.230 --> 26:46.648
Takes me to you guys.

26:46.732 --> 26:49.193
So, you both look off
when I say, "No need."

26:49.735 --> 26:52.529
GINA CARANO: <i>Me and Carl</i>
<i>speak a special language, I feel.</i>

26:52.613 --> 26:56.867

<i>He is an artist to his core.</i>

We're on the streets of Nevarro now,
rebuilt from season one.

27:09.213 --> 27:11.798
Season two, we're starting out.
I think we're in week three.

27:23.477 --> 27:29.691
It was so exciting to step into an episode
that gets back into a kind of ensemble

27:29.775 --> 27:33.111
<i>with characters that we've met</i>
<i>and actors that I've been with.</i>

27:33.195 --> 27:35.531
<i>It was like being reunited with family.</i>

THE MANDALORIAN: I had a run-in
with the New Republic.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.453

<i>The way that she puts that into</i>
<i>Cara Dune's character, her backstory,</i>

27:54.132 --> 27:57.261
I think just makes you
not be able to look away.

27:59.263 --> 28:01.974
CARANO: <i>Season one,</i>
<i>Cara Dune was very fresh</i>

28:02.057 --> 28:06.687
off of being kind of
just out on her own and alone.

28:06.770 --> 28:09.189
<i>She doesn't want anything</i>
<i>to do with anybody.</i>

<i>we find, all right,</i>
<i>now she's establishing herself.</i>

28:15.946 --> 28:17.489
<i>She started stepping up to the plate.</i>

28:17.573 --> 28:19.575
Things have changed a lot around here.

28:19.658 --> 28:22.786
Cara Dune's character
is upgraded to a marshal.

28:22.870 --> 28:26.915
And because of that, I wanted
her costume to reflect a higher station,

28:26.999 --> 28:28.709
<i>a higher responsibility.</i>

28:28.792 --> 28:30.627
<i>So I upgraded her armor a little bit,</i>

28:30.711 --> 28:32.171
<i>I gave her a new paint job.</i>

28:32.254 --> 28:33.755
<i>It still has some cuts and bruises,</i>

28:33.839 --> 28:36.633

28:36.717 --> 28:38.135
I was respecting that as well.

<i>so this season you definitely get it.</i>

28:47.269 --> 28:50.981

30:19.611 --> 30:21.280
<i>It is in the Volume or the stage.</i>

But if you look at the story,

30:24.283 --> 30:26.451
it happens entirely outside.

30:26.535 --> 30:30.539
So, we're doing that
for various lighting reasons,

with the hood down.

33:06.570 --> 33:08.030
I like losing that business.

33:08.113 --> 33:12.701
This is so strong. Your face is so strong.
There you go. (LAUGHS)

33:12.784 --> 33:15.329
There are moments when I just stare at her
and I'm just like,

33:15.412 --> 33:17.080
"Wow, she just looks like..."

33:17.164 --> 33:18.999
-She came alive?
-"...this thing I've drawn."

33:20.000 --> 33:22.628
<i>Rosario's done all the research,</i>
<i>like, she knows the character,</i>

33:22.711 --> 33:24.671
<i>but now she has to become it</i>

33:24.755 --> 33:26.507
in a way that's never happened before.

33:28.717 --> 33:31.803
SIPE: <i>Her character was tricky</i>
<i>'cause it was walking that line</i>

33:31.887 --> 33:36.099
<i>of finding her look</i>
<i>between human-realistic</i>

33:36.183 --> 33:41.563
and something that would satisfy
the fans for the <i>Clone Wars</i> graphic image.

33:55.744 --> 33:58.830
I loved working with her.
You know, because there are nerves.

33:58.914 --> 34:01.416
You wanna make sure
you get things right,

34:01.500 --> 34:05.128
<i>and there's a lot of, like, heavy thinking</i>
<i>that goes on, and so</i>

34:05.212 --> 34:08.757
she was able to really help me
kind of like, you know,

34:08.841 --> 34:11.593
forget what I was doing and just have fun.

34:11.677 --> 34:13.178
We get another scene together.

34:13.262 --> 34:15.305
Yeah, I know, it's great. Yeah!

34:20.644 --> 34:24.147
ROTH: <i>We wanted something slender,</i>
<i>something really elegant for her sabers.</i>

34:24.231 --> 34:27.109
Basically, it's a katana and a shoto.
We were also trying to work

34:27.192 --> 34:30.320
<i>with the technology that we needed</i>
<i>to talk to our lighting console.</i>

34:30.404 --> 34:32.990
<i>So, with the batteries</i>
<i>and with the receivers,</i>

34:33.073 --> 34:35.826
<i>all the different wireless gak</i>
<i>we had to put inside of it,</i>

34:35.909 --> 34:39.121
the saber kept getting bigger and bigger,
and Dave was just,

34:39.204 --> 34:41.456
"No. It can't look like this."

34:41.540 --> 34:43.125
We went through different iterations

34:43.208 --> 34:45.085
where we basically ended up
slimming it down

34:45.169 --> 34:46.712
<i>and having to use an external battery</i>

34:46.795 --> 34:49.047
<i>to get to what we needed,</i>
<i>so it looked correct.</i>

34:49.131 --> 34:50.799
-Stop.
-Yeah. As soon as we get 'em,

34:50.883 --> 34:52.259
-we'll get 'em to you.
-Exciting.

34:52.342 --> 34:54.344
-Looks good.
-What did you do today?

34:54.428 --> 34:58.015
The big advance that we had
with lightsabers over the past few years,

34:58.098 --> 35:00.225
<i>of course, is getting</i>
<i>that interactive lighting</i>

35:00.309 --> 35:01.643
<i>on the characters in the shots.</i>

35:01.727 --> 35:03.687
(BOTH GRUNTING)

35:04.146 --> 35:07.566
BLUFF: <i>The DP can now frame based upon</i>

35:07.649 --> 35:10.694
where the light is in the scene
coming from the lightsaber,

35:10.777 --> 35:13.447
so all of a sudden we can have
a really kind of moody scene,

35:13.530 --> 35:16.283
<i>Ahsoka coming through the trees,</i>
<i>and play her in silhouette</i>

35:16.366 --> 35:19.328
<i>until she turns her lightsabers on</i>
<i>and it shapes her face.</i>

35:22.164 --> 35:24.541
If you're going low... Yeah!
You will go get more...

35:24.625 --> 35:26.668
The lower you are, the more...

35:27.753 --> 35:30.214
WATSON: That's good.
LATEEF CROWDER: Beautiful. Beautiful.

35:30.297 --> 35:32.966
Rosario has this charisma and passion

35:33.050 --> 35:34.843
<i>about whatever it is she's doing,</i>

35:34.927 --> 35:36.720
<i>-that she gets really into it.</i>
-Up high.

35:36.803 --> 35:40.015
She focuses a lot. She looks at you,
she really wants to know,

35:40.098 --> 35:42.518
you're teaching her movements.
She's right behind you.

35:42.601 --> 35:45.479
Another step,
left foot goes forward. Yeah.

35:45.562 --> 35:49.483
And I come in... Hold it like this,
and then coming back up?

35:49.566 --> 35:51.193
CROWDER: <i>In trying to honor the old films,</i>

35:51.276 --> 35:53.654
he has to have that samurai feel,
it's based on them.

35:53.737 --> 35:56.532
Slash. Slash.

35:57.533 --> 36:01.745
Flowy movements. Flowing from one move
to another. Instead of... (GRUNTING)

36:01.828 --> 36:05.791
You know, it was more flow from the sword,
so it was still samurai,

36:05.874 --> 36:07.793
<i>but it wasn't so clean.</i>

36:15.634 --> 36:17.886
-MAN 1: All right, we're gonna go again.
-When he says,

36:19.680 --> 36:21.807
"I wished... I prefer if you took him."

36:21.890 --> 36:25.519
-Have Grogu look up at Dad like, "Really?"
-MAN 2: Okay.

36:25.602 --> 36:28.522
And then she's there talking,
and then have him look back to her.

36:28.605 --> 36:31.567
But this little moment, if my dad said,
"I prefer if you took him."

36:31.650 --> 36:33.402
MAN 2: You'd go,
"What're you talking about?"

36:33.485 --> 36:35.195
Yeah. Not like shocking, but just like...

36:35.279 --> 36:37.865
-No, but just kind of look... Yeah.
-MAN 2: Acknowledging each other.

36:37.948 --> 36:41.076
I don't like bringing characters in
unless there's a real value to it.

36:41.159 --> 36:43.787
<i>So when I wrote the episode</i>
<i>with her in it this year,</i>

36:43.871 --> 36:48.417
<i>it really was about</i>
<i>how can we learn this child's name?</i>

36:48.500 --> 36:50.669
Who would know these things?

36:51.378 --> 36:53.547
AHSOKA TANO: Grogu and I can feel
each other's thoughts.

36:55.674 --> 36:59.386
FILONI: <i>What's fascinating is,</i>
<i>she's the first character we've met</i>

36:59.469 --> 37:00.929
<i>that really actually knew Yoda.</i>

37:01.013 --> 37:03.348
<i>So, it's bringing back</i>
<i>all these memories and things</i>

37:03.432 --> 37:06.476
<i>that aren't unlike</i>
<i>what the viewer experienced as well</i>

37:06.560 --> 37:08.478
<i>when they saw the Child</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

37:09.521 --> 37:12.482
<i>I learned so much making that episode,</i>
<i>you know,</i>

37:12.566 --> 37:14.902
<i>and I hope to bring that</i>
<i>to future episodes.</i>

37:14.985 --> 37:16.278
<i>Never stop learning.</i>

37:16.862 --> 37:19.364
That's the way of the Jedi,
never stopped learning.

37:20.490 --> 37:22.701
You wanna hold him?
You wanna hold the baby?

37:23.202 --> 37:26.663
-No. You're being mean.
-There you go.

37:26.747 --> 37:30.042
-WOMAN: Aw! I'm gonna die!
-This is it. Hold on a second.

37:30.626 --> 37:32.503
GEORGE LUCAS: Yeah. Yeah.

37:32.586 --> 37:34.838
WOMAN:
That's your great-great-great grandfather.

37:34.922 --> 37:37.007
-It is.
-(ALL LAUGHING)

37:47.601 --> 37:50.771
CARANO: <i>Robert Rodriguez, like,</i>
<i>blew my mind.</i>

37:50.854 --> 37:52.814
I worked with you for a day

37:52.898 --> 37:56.652
and you changed my perspective
on the universe. (LAUGHS)

37:57.486 --> 38:00.572
MING-NA WEN: <i>He's so chill. You know,</i>
<i>he brings his guitar, he hangs out.</i>

38:00.656 --> 38:02.908
But you know, in his head, it's non-stop.

38:05.369 --> 38:08.288
PASCAL: <i>What I think is so cool</i>
<i>about Robert,</i>

38:08.372 --> 38:12.835
is to bring his danger and grit
into an episode

38:13.252 --> 38:17.589
<i>and usher in an iconic character.</i>

38:20.342 --> 38:22.761
There wasn't anybody better than Robert
to bring that in.

38:22.845 --> 38:25.347
FILONI: <i>Everybody loves Boba.</i>
<i>He's a great character,</i>

38:25.430 --> 38:29.226
<i>and it's about authenticity</i>
<i>and at times connectivity</i>

38:29.309 --> 38:31.812
to other parts of <i>Star Wars</i> we know,
when it makes sense

38:31.895 --> 38:34.773
and where should that character appear?
Probably in this show.

38:39.695 --> 38:42.155
FAVREAU: <i>Do you think</i>
<i>they all know it's a prediction,</i>

38:42.239 --> 38:43.907
-are they gonna know it's Boba?
-Oh, yeah.

38:43.991 --> 38:45.033
Right... Instantly.

38:45.117 --> 38:48.537
But the debate will be,
they'll say, "No, that's..."

38:48.620 --> 38:50.747
-Mando?
-"Mando." And then they'll be like,

38:50.831 --> 38:53.792
"No, that's a Boba Fett sound,
they're messing with us."

38:53.876 --> 38:55.669
But they already said it's not Boba.

38:55.794 --> 38:57.337
Our guy had spurs, but not like that.

39:01.133 --> 39:04.219
You know, I was nine years old
when the first <i>Star Wars</i> came out.

39:04.303 --> 39:07.097
Saw it again and again,
all its re-releases,

39:07.181 --> 39:11.101
and I was already a huge Boba Fett fan
before <i>Empire Strikes Back</i> even came out.

39:11.185 --> 39:13.770
<i>So Boba was a star</i>
<i>before the film ever premiered</i>

39:13.854 --> 39:17.274
<i>and had us kids just so excited</i>
<i>to see the movie,</i>

39:17.357 --> 39:18.567
<i>and to see him in it.</i>

39:18.650 --> 39:21.612
<i>And anything called a bounty hunter</i>
<i>back then was just cool.</i>

39:21.695 --> 39:25.282
<i>And the fact that you couldn't see</i>
<i>his face shrouded him in mystery.</i>

39:25.365 --> 39:27.284
<i>You know, he was the flipside to Han Solo.</i>

39:27.367 --> 39:31.788
<i>He had a jetpack, a cool ship,</i>
<i>really cool name.</i>

39:31.872 --> 39:34.708
I just remember that time period very well

39:34.791 --> 39:38.086
of just the mystery of him, and he was
just always my favorite character.

39:38.170 --> 39:41.340
TEMUERA MORRISON: <i>I feel real honored</i>
<i>to</i><i>bring back this character</i>

39:41.423 --> 39:44.092
and become the son of Jango.

39:45.677 --> 39:46.803
LANDO: Help!

39:48.639 --> 39:51.141
The last time we see him,
you know, after the barge,

39:51.225 --> 39:52.684
he falls into the Sarlacc.

39:52.768 --> 39:53.769
BOBA FETT: What the...

39:53.852 --> 39:54.895
(SCREAMING)

39:54.978 --> 39:58.982
SIPE:<i> For us to think, "Okay,</i>
<i>he survived that,</i><i>the belly of the beast."</i>

39:59.942 --> 40:02.653
<i>You know, with stomach acids</i>
<i>and stuff like that.</i>

40:02.736 --> 40:07.324
<i>Jon and Dave wanted something to show</i>
<i>that something really happened to him.</i>

40:07.407 --> 40:09.535
The first makeup test
that we did was kind of like,

40:09.618 --> 40:10.869
<i>"This is how far we can go."</i>

40:13.497 --> 40:17.209
<i>And then it got refined, so that</i>
<i>we can see a little bit more of him.</i>

40:17.292 --> 40:19.711
Save some of the humanity,
so that it's still there.

40:19.795 --> 40:21.922
I think whatever it is,
it should be evocative

40:22.005 --> 40:23.507
of whatever people's memory is.

40:23.590 --> 40:26.176
-Take the one from Jabba's.
-MAN: The other way you held it.

40:26.260 --> 40:27.636
It's stock under arm, right?

40:27.719 --> 40:29.054
Try the stock under arm to see.

40:29.137 --> 40:31.640
-Yeah, like that feels like Boba to me.
-Like that.

40:31.723 --> 40:33.934
With that tilted down.

40:34.017 --> 40:35.185
Let's look it up.

40:38.063 --> 40:41.066
TRPCIC: <i>What really makes it </i>Star Wars,
<i>and I've heard this from every actor</i>

40:41.149 --> 40:42.192
that we've fit.

40:42.276 --> 40:45.863
When they put on the costume,
they're like, "This is it."

40:45.946 --> 40:49.157
<i>Especially Tem, who plays Boba Fett.</i>

40:49.241 --> 40:53.328
<i>When he put on his costume,</i>
<i>his posture changed.</i>

40:53.412 --> 40:55.831
You see the difference?
You see the perspective?

40:55.914 --> 40:57.624
(ALL LAUGHING)

40:57.708 --> 40:59.918
MORRISON:<i> It's quite a dynamic feeling</i>
<i>to be in that armor.</i>

41:00.836 --> 41:02.087
<i>He's the kingpin.</i>

41:02.171 --> 41:05.507
He's the kingpin of the galaxy.
You don't wanna mess with this guy.

41:05.591 --> 41:07.926
It's like when you walk
into those cowboy bars

41:08.010 --> 41:09.887
and the saloon doors open.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.638
<i>The first thing</i>
<i>you're gonna find out is,</i>

41:11.722 --> 41:14.224
<i>who's the number one gunslinger</i>
<i>around here.</i>

41:14.308 --> 41:15.809
<i>Otherwise, you're dead, so...</i>

41:16.393 --> 41:17.686
So, I'm that guy.

41:17.769 --> 41:18.896
(LAUGHS)

41:24.067 --> 41:26.570
I ended up turning
a three-page battle scene

41:26.653 --> 41:28.655
into a nine-minute battle scene

41:28.739 --> 41:32.993
because I was just that excited
to be bringing Boba back,

41:33.076 --> 41:35.996
<i>and I had an idea, right away I told Jon.</i>

41:36.079 --> 41:38.207
<i>I've been waiting</i>
<i>to see this version of Boba Fett</i>

41:38.290 --> 41:40.792
<i>since I was a kid.</i>
<i>Boba has to be different,</i>

41:40.876 --> 41:43.086
<i>he can't just seem like another Mando,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

41:43.170 --> 41:45.631
<i>He has to move differently,</i>
<i>feel different,</i>

41:45.714 --> 41:48.050
<i>occupy completely different space,</i>

41:48.133 --> 41:52.262
<i>and have a weight and gravitas to him</i>
<i>that shows why he's such a legend.</i>

41:52.346 --> 41:56.600
I wanted him to live up to his name
that we would whisper since we were kids.

41:57.768 --> 42:02.189
<i>Be that mysterious character with a past</i>
<i>that makes you wanna know</i><i>more about him.</i>

42:02.898 --> 42:07.152
<i>If Mando is a gunslinger,</i>
<i>Boba needs to be a barbarian.</i>

42:07.236 --> 42:10.572
So, to illustrate
what I was talking about,

42:10.656 --> 42:13.825
I took my Boba Fett
and stormtrooper Halloween costumes

42:13.909 --> 42:17.287
and put them on my sons
and went into the backyard

42:17.371 --> 42:18.997
and filmed Boba's arrival.

42:25.671 --> 42:27.798
<i>And since I didn't have stuntmen</i>
<i>at my disposal,</i>

42:27.881 --> 42:30.092
<i>I used my </i>Star Wars<i> action figures</i>

42:30.175 --> 42:33.345
<i>'cause a picture's worth a thousand words</i>
<i>and helped me just communicate</i>

42:33.428 --> 42:35.931
<i>what I was going for with a crew.</i>

42:36.014 --> 42:38.642
And when I first showed it to Jon
and Dave Filoni, Dave said,

42:38.725 --> 42:41.812
"Wait a minute. Were those
just action figures I saw?"

42:41.895 --> 42:44.940
And I said, "Well, yeah,
I didn't have anything else on hand."

42:45.023 --> 42:49.027
And he said, "No, you don't understand.
That makes it the coolest animatic ever."

42:49.111 --> 42:51.864
And I just thought, "These are my people!"

42:55.409 --> 42:59.162
Another thing about this character, Boba,
you know, the actual fight,

42:59.246 --> 43:00.831
and the way he fights,

43:00.914 --> 43:05.043
I'm actually drawing a lot
on my Māori traditional side.

43:05.127 --> 43:11.049
<i>Thing called the Haka. "Ha" is the breath.</i>
<i>"Ka" is fire. "Fire breath."</i>

43:13.594 --> 43:17.514
Temuera happened to show Jon
his traditional Māori dance,

43:17.598 --> 43:21.560
<i>which is a lot of spinning of the stick,</i>
<i>stomping, the tongue out and everything.</i>

43:21.643 --> 43:23.770
<i>And Jon saw that, and he asked me</i>

43:23.854 --> 43:26.440
<i>if we could do anything with that style</i>
<i>and make it fit.</i>

43:26.523 --> 43:30.402
<i>After we talked about it, we told Josh</i>
<i>to start making this Māori weapon.</i>

43:30.485 --> 43:34.114
ROTH: <i>Temuera specifically requested</i>
<i>his own gaffi stick.</i>

43:34.198 --> 43:36.950
He wanted one that was longer
and one that was more slender.

43:37.034 --> 43:39.411
<i>If you look at the other ones</i>
<i>from the earlier films,</i>

43:39.494 --> 43:42.372
<i>it's much more...</i>
<i>The shaft if just thicker and wider.</i>

43:42.456 --> 43:45.792
<i>It didn't lend itself to the choreography</i>
<i>that he wanted for his fight.</i>

43:45.876 --> 43:47.836
<i>We wanted to make sure</i>
<i>we had something specific</i>

43:47.920 --> 43:50.422
<i>that he could have the action.</i>
<i>The action's pretty brutal.</i>

43:50.506 --> 43:52.257
He's gonna go
after some stormtroopers.

43:52.341 --> 43:54.510
I'm pretty excited about that.
(CHUCKLES)

43:56.845 --> 43:59.139
We had to take the show to location
for the first time

43:59.223 --> 44:01.767
because of its scope, really.

44:01.850 --> 44:04.978
<i>You know, the Volume's incredible,</i>
<i>but it has limitations.</i>

44:05.062 --> 44:06.980
ANDREW L. JONES:
<i>Direct sunlight over a large area,</i>

44:07.064 --> 44:11.276
that's difficult to do, that particular
lighting condition in the Volume.

44:11.360 --> 44:14.530
KLEIN: <i>Whenever we're going to do</i>
<i>direct sun,</i><i>we usually go to the back lot.</i>

44:14.613 --> 44:16.490
<i>And the back lot</i>
<i>wasn't big enough for this.</i>

44:16.573 --> 44:17.824
So we ended up in Simi Valley.

44:19.117 --> 44:20.661
<i>The terrain was so difficult.</i>

44:20.744 --> 44:24.289
<i>Everything we wanted to take up</i>
<i>onto those rocks, we had to hand carry.</i>

44:24.373 --> 44:27.125
It's dry up there in Simi Valley.
We couldn't have any fire.

44:27.209 --> 44:28.252
<i>You know, no explosions.</i>

44:28.335 --> 44:31.380
<i>Except for when Fennec's</i>
<i>running on the rock.</i>

44:31.463 --> 44:33.674
Those were practical.
Those were practical explosions,

44:33.757 --> 44:36.093
<i>and I think it's because</i>
<i>they were far enough away</i>

44:36.176 --> 44:38.136
<i>from everything that was combustible.</i>

44:38.220 --> 44:40.973
<i>And the fire department's there</i>
<i>when you do that sort of thing.</i>

44:41.056 --> 44:44.560
<i>The special effects guys, they all have</i>
<i>fire extinguishers all over the place.</i>

44:44.643 --> 44:46.645
<i>And it's very safe, but obviously,</i>

44:46.728 --> 44:49.481
the bigger explosions,
those were all visual effects.

44:51.149 --> 44:52.860
(ALL GRUNTING)

44:57.030 --> 44:58.907
MING-NA WEN: <i>I love doing physical stuff.</i>

44:59.950 --> 45:02.244
Every day we're running, jumping, we're...

45:02.327 --> 45:04.997
We were parkouring
up these Rocky Mountain peaks.

45:08.041 --> 45:12.838
<i>There was one point when</i>
<i>we were really high up in the rocks,</i>

45:12.921 --> 45:16.884
and I'm watching the cameraman carrying
these 50 pound, I'm trying to traverse,

45:16.967 --> 45:18.677
and we're trying to avoid poison oaks,

45:18.760 --> 45:21.722
<i>and we're trying to avoid rattlesnakes</i>
<i>and divots and stuff.</i>

45:21.805 --> 45:24.141
I was like, "Okay,
let's go back to the Volume."

45:26.560 --> 45:30.147
RODRIGUEZ: <i>My approach was to pretend</i>
<i>that this is the only other time</i>

45:30.230 --> 45:33.066
<i>or episode we'll even see Boba Fett.</i>

45:34.443 --> 45:35.652
And it needs to satisfy.

45:35.736 --> 45:36.987
I don't wanna take for granted

45:37.070 --> 45:39.198
<i>that he'll show up again</i>
<i>later in other episodes.</i>

45:39.281 --> 45:41.992
<i>He needs to be all things</i>
<i>right here, right now.</i>

45:42.951 --> 45:44.912
<i>That's what Boba Fett is all about.</i>

45:44.995 --> 45:47.414
This episode needed to say,

45:47.497 --> 45:51.627
"Boba is back,"
and that was my main personal mission.

45:51.710 --> 45:54.880

46:07.017 --> 46:08.977
<i>On the sands of Tatooine</i>

46:15.776 --> 46:19.029
It's an interesting process
that happens on the show

46:19.112 --> 46:23.116
because Jon is a writer
and does a lot of the writing

46:23.200 --> 46:26.119
<i>and Dave and I, I think,</i>
<i>are the only ones</i>

46:26.203 --> 46:29.665
<i>other than Chris Yost,</i>
<i>who've written on the show.</i>

46:30.499 --> 46:34.127
Part of the process
was the refining of the script

46:34.211 --> 46:39.216
as different ideas came together
and different things started to gel.

46:39.299 --> 46:43.387
BILL BURR:<i> Rick has it all in his head.</i>
<i>He's so cool and laid-back.</i>

46:43.470 --> 46:47.808
You know what I mean?
If you watch the episodes that he's done,

46:47.891 --> 46:50.894
you think that he'd be like this guy
on his toes and really like that.

46:50.978 --> 46:53.689
<i>He's just totally chill. He's like,</i>
<i>"Now we're gonna do this.</i>

46:53.772 --> 46:56.567
"Now we're gonna do that."
And then he just puts...

46:56.650 --> 46:58.902
The way he puts it together,
yeah, is amazing.

Let's clean it up.

47:01.405 --> 47:02.406
CARANO: Where are we now?

47:03.031 --> 47:06.326
I really appreciated
and I love working with Rick.

47:06.410 --> 47:07.536
He's my...

47:08.161 --> 47:09.872
I'd work with Rick
any day of the week.

47:09.955 --> 47:11.623
Let's go! I've got a job for you.

47:11.707 --> 47:15.460
<i>If you wanted to try something</i>
<i>as a character he'd be like,</i>

47:15.544 --> 47:17.337
<i>"All right, yeah. Well, you can try it."</i>

47:17.421 --> 47:21.466
And a lot of directors
like to take control and just, like,

47:21.550 --> 47:23.051
"Be what I want you to be."

47:23.135 --> 47:25.929
And Rick is like,
"All right. What you got in there?"

47:26.013 --> 47:29.308
FAMUYIWA: He comes right after with the
"Weren't you two the transport..."

47:29.391 --> 47:32.436
He would notice where
you were discovering things

47:32.519 --> 47:34.897
<i>and, in recognizing that,</i>
<i>he would lean towards it.</i>

47:34.980 --> 47:38.233
<i>And that was cool.</i>
<i>'Cause Rick's episode is the first time</i>

47:38.317 --> 47:39.943
<i>that Mando takes his helmet off.</i>

47:40.027 --> 47:42.905
<i>It's the first time we see his face</i>
<i>in season two.</i>

47:42.988 --> 47:45.532
And then I think the very first...
No, I'm sure.

47:45.616 --> 47:48.368
The very first time another human being
sees his face

47:48.452 --> 47:50.495
since he first put on the mask.

47:51.538 --> 47:54.583
You the tank troopers
who delivered the shipment of rhydonium?

47:55.167 --> 47:57.252
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

47:59.129 --> 48:01.590
PASCAL: <i>It's very economical</i>
<i>and subtle storytelling</i>

48:01.673 --> 48:04.051
<i>and all about risking it all,</i>

48:04.134 --> 48:07.095
the value system, the Creed,
and everything to save the Child.

48:07.804 --> 48:13.018
"Do we end this, you know,
sort of recon mission right here,

48:13.101 --> 48:16.605
"or am I going to do the thing
I said I'd never do?"

48:16.688 --> 48:20.817
<i>But I think, for him</i>
<i>at this point, he is deciding</i>

48:20.901 --> 48:24.112
<i>what his code really means for him</i>
<i>and protecting</i>

48:24.196 --> 48:27.699
this child is at the center of it.

48:28.534 --> 48:32.704
<i>I like the idea that inside of </i>Star Wars,

48:32.788 --> 48:35.582
<i>which is gonna be filled</i>
<i>with a lot of big action,</i>

48:35.666 --> 48:38.919
<i>that you could have</i>
<i>this quiet, tense scene</i>

48:39.002 --> 48:43.507
<i>between these people</i>
<i>who have competing agendas,</i>

48:43.590 --> 48:45.467
<i>who are trying to figure each other out.</i>

48:45.551 --> 48:47.928
All heroes of the Empire.

48:48.011 --> 48:53.725
A fun and different break to take
within the world of <i>Star Wars</i> and Mando.

48:58.605 --> 49:02.150
Nobody's ever seen what goes on
inside that ship when it rotates.

49:02.234 --> 49:04.027
-Reorients.
-We've only seen the outside.

49:04.111 --> 49:05.237
-Yeah.
-So that's...

49:05.320 --> 49:07.906
That was one of the inspirations
for doing it on this stage.

49:07.990 --> 49:09.867
Taking advantage
of what this stage could do.

49:09.950 --> 49:10.993
Spinning's a good trick.

49:11.076 --> 49:12.870
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

49:13.453 --> 49:17.291
The ship has this condition
where it rotates when it takes off.

49:17.374 --> 49:19.877
It starts off flat,
and then it goes like that.

49:19.960 --> 49:23.589
<i>So, the pilot sits on his back,</i>
<i>when it takes off, it rotates,</i>

49:23.672 --> 49:27.009
now he's sitting upright.
But down below is the navigation room,

49:27.092 --> 49:31.013
and as the ship takes off
and it rotates into its flying condition,

49:31.096 --> 49:33.765
<i>that part of the ship stays level.</i>

49:33.849 --> 49:36.560
BLUFF: <i>Instantly I knew that was</i>
<i>something we'd try in the Volume.</i>

49:36.643 --> 49:39.271
<i>And it got me incredibly excited</i>
<i>because I think it's something</i>

49:39.354 --> 49:42.983
that kids back in the day
would've played with that ship

49:43.066 --> 49:46.195
and wondered what it would be like
on the inside when it rotates through.

49:47.821 --> 49:51.366
JONES: <i>It was a bit of a challenge to</i>
<i>see if this would work on screens.</i>

49:51.450 --> 49:54.036
But to do that
with traditional special effects,

49:54.119 --> 49:55.120
you can imagine.

49:55.204 --> 49:57.497
It would be this huge, complicated rig.

49:57.581 --> 50:00.542
<i>So we built an elevated deck</i>
<i>with some seats on it,</i>

50:00.626 --> 50:03.212
<i>and there's a console as well.</i>
<i>But that's the set.</i>

50:03.295 --> 50:05.756
<i>All of the rest of the vehicle</i>
<i>is on the content.</i>

50:05.839 --> 50:06.840
MAN: Action.

50:06.924 --> 50:10.802
BLUFF: <i>We got to ultimately shoot it</i>
<i>on the stage against the LEDs.</i>

50:10.886 --> 50:13.138
<i>And boy, oh, boy, was everybody excited.</i>

50:13.222 --> 50:15.766
<i>I think that was the moment on season two</i>

50:15.849 --> 50:19.770
<i>that mimicked the hyperspace</i>
<i>being turned on in season one.</i>

50:19.853 --> 50:22.689
<i>It got everybody excited,</i>
<i>everybody knew where we were,</i>

50:22.773 --> 50:25.317
<i>and everybody felt like a child again.</i>
<i>It was wonderful.</i>

50:26.735 --> 50:28.237
Never gets old.

50:36.954 --> 50:39.873
BLUFF: <i>One of the exciting things</i>
<i>that we did on season two</i>

50:39.957 --> 50:43.919
is we built a five-foot long
light cruiser miniature model.

50:47.297 --> 50:53.011
GOODSON: This part slides out,
and that will access the front rod mount.

50:53.095 --> 50:56.265
But what's inside this
is this little TIE fighter bay.

50:56.348 --> 50:58.100
And this is where
the TIE fighter bay fits.

50:58.183 --> 50:59.643
It's right back in here.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.235
BLUFF: <i>John Knoll used</i>
<i>his motion-control rig</i>

51:08.318 --> 51:11.655
<i>to shoot a number</i>
<i>of miniature shots for that.</i>

51:12.656 --> 51:15.742
It's a classic sort of
Star Destroyer-ish ship,

51:15.826 --> 51:18.745
<i>but in a unique design with</i>
<i>interior lighting. It's just gorgeous.</i>

51:18.829 --> 51:22.749
<i>We were all giddy as school children</i>
<i>when we saw the first takes come through.</i>

51:23.750 --> 51:28.088
It looks like we're transported right back
to the late '70s or early '80s,

51:28.172 --> 51:32.009
<i>doing exactly the same George did,</i>
<i>and we have that characteristic.</i>

51:32.092 --> 51:36.013
<i>It takes me back to when I was a kid,</i>
<i>when I wanted it. I want that model.</i>

51:36.096 --> 51:37.306
It's pretty spectacular.

51:42.519 --> 51:46.356
JONES: <i>Also, we've been using miniatures</i>
<i>in a little bit different way.</i>

51:46.440 --> 51:48.901
We make the miniature,
and instead of filming on it,

51:48.984 --> 51:51.695
<i>it gets scanned,</i>
<i>and then put up on the screens.</i>

51:51.778 --> 51:54.990
In episode seven,
the miniature model maker

51:55.073 --> 51:59.453
<i>built 12, 15 TIE fighter balls</i>
<i>and this wonderful table top set</i>

51:59.536 --> 52:01.663
<i>to be visualized on the screen.</i>

52:01.747 --> 52:04.708
<i>That's an example</i>
<i>of taking the practical models</i>

52:04.791 --> 52:07.336
<i>and bringing it into today's technology.</i>

52:07.419 --> 52:11.089
There's something about the hand.
You know, actually physically making it.

52:11.173 --> 52:14.635
<i>It gives it a look</i>
<i>that is uniquely </i>Star Wars.

52:15.928 --> 52:16.929
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)

52:17.012 --> 52:22.434
At the heart of what I wanted to do
with this episode was that, you know,

52:22.518 --> 52:28.023
I think where we see <i>Star Wars</i>
sometimes in stark ways.

52:28.106 --> 52:30.943
<i>You know, there's the light</i><i>and the dark,</i>

52:31.026 --> 52:33.862
<i>and there's the Rebels or the Empire.</i>

52:33.946 --> 52:38.534
<i>What I really wanted to do was just kind</i>
<i>of have this conversation about that,</i>

52:38.617 --> 52:42.663
and that these things aren't always
as black and white,

52:42.746 --> 52:44.456
<i>and that there's so much gray,</i>

52:44.540 --> 52:48.085
<i>and especially when we're talking</i>
<i>about power,</i>

52:48.168 --> 52:50.796
and the use of power,
and the transfer of power.

52:50.879 --> 52:55.259
<i>For me, I felt like, let's see how far</i>
<i>we can keep pushing things</i>

52:55.342 --> 52:58.595
and how much bigger
we can tell these stories.

52:58.679 --> 53:00.180
To the Empire.

53:03.559 --> 53:06.562
Bang against the floor,
and then looking at it,

53:06.645 --> 53:10.107
and then almost surprising yourself.
(EXCLAIMS) I think I got it.

53:23.745 --> 53:25.581
I don't think
I could have lived with myself

53:25.664 --> 53:27.749
<i>if I turned down doing that finale.</i>

53:27.833 --> 53:32.462
<i>That was an exciting thing, to have Mando</i>
<i>at the center of this rescue mission.</i>

53:32.546 --> 53:35.632
<i>And then to have Bo-Katan</i>
<i>and to have Koska,</i>

53:35.716 --> 53:39.136
<i>and then to have Fennec and Cara</i>
<i>making their way</i>

53:39.219 --> 53:42.598
<i>through this Imperial ship.</i>
<i>That was fantastic.</i>

53:42.681 --> 53:45.225
When I read the script,
I was like, I'm dying to do this.

53:45.309 --> 53:48.103
Pivot into that position here.

53:48.187 --> 53:51.106
And then I'll cue, ding!
Door will open and...

It's intense, man. It's feeling good.

55:08.392 --> 55:12.938
Moff Gideon is not a master swordsman.
He feels more like a bureaucrat.

55:13.021 --> 55:16.483
But what he does have is
he has the Darksaber in his possession,

55:16.567 --> 55:18.819
and he also has this rage.

55:18.902 --> 55:22.239
<i>And we almost got into trouble</i>

55:22.322 --> 55:26.118
by running through
too many prop Darksabers. (LAUGHS)

55:26.201 --> 55:28.996
Josh, the prop master, was...
He wasn't thrilled, but he was there.

55:29.079 --> 55:30.247
He was totally prepared.

If he's coming
with a lot of energy and heart,

55:49.808 --> 55:51.810
I have to really be on point, too,

55:51.894 --> 55:54.354

and on point.

<i>by that.</i>

56:04.448 --> 56:05.699
REED: Your attitude's right, too.

56:05.782 --> 56:06.992
-Thank you.
-Yeah, man.

56:11.246 --> 56:12.998
REED: Still, still, still.

56:15.292 --> 56:19.838
Okay, front two, we're getting ready
to do the arm raise in three, two, one.

56:21.715 --> 56:22.925
Lock it.

56:23.008 --> 56:26.345
One of the exciting parts
about the Dark Trooper designs

56:26.428 --> 56:27.971
was that Jon,

56:28.805 --> 56:31.225
as always, wants to photograph something.

56:31.308 --> 56:34.186
<i>Not do it as a full CG version.</i>

56:34.269 --> 56:37.314
<i>He would have us, very specifically,</i>

56:37.397 --> 56:42.277
<i>look at the way that the surfaces</i>
<i>on Darth Vader would reflect the light.</i>

56:42.361 --> 56:44.404
<i>You look at the shoulder pads</i>
<i>or the helmet,</i>

56:44.488 --> 56:47.241
it's not a perfect surface.
With a 3D model,

56:47.324 --> 56:51.245
you'll get a perfect surface
unless it's engineered and modeled in

56:51.328 --> 56:53.247
from the artist to not be perfect.

56:53.330 --> 56:58.544
<i>And so what was important to Jon</i>
<i>was that we photographed actors in-camera.</i>

56:58.627 --> 57:00.754
For the live-action version, we knew

57:00.838 --> 57:02.798
that they had to be
performed by stunt actors.

57:03.549 --> 57:06.635
<i>And that demanded that we couldn't modify</i>
<i>the portions too much,</i>

57:06.718 --> 57:11.056
<i>and yet we still had to make sure that</i>
<i>it looked like the original inspiration.</i>

57:13.267 --> 57:17.479
To really highlight the fact
that there isn't a human inside the droid,

57:17.563 --> 57:19.356
<i>what we're doing in visual effects</i>

57:19.439 --> 57:22.150

57:30.784 --> 57:33.161

57:33.245 --> 57:35.581
You don't see it, but he has
one wrapped around this way

57:35.664 --> 57:38.792

BLUFF: <i>Jabba's palace, we were desperate</i>
<i>to put that on the Volume.</i>

57:48.468 --> 57:52.931
The challenge with Jabba's palace is
we simply couldn't find a good seam

57:53.015 --> 57:56.643
for where we could go from practical
to the digital walls.

57:56.727 --> 57:59.771

58:21.293 --> 58:24.338

58:24.421 --> 58:28.467

we look through here with pictures.

FILONI: <i>When we do recreate things,</i>
<i>like Jabba's palace,</i>

58:57.412 --> 58:59.081

Well, yeah. As a kid, I even had
the Bib Fortuna action figurine

1:01:08.752 --> 1:01:11.338
that Michael Carter played,
and to have the staff

1:01:11.421 --> 1:01:14.299
