00:00.630 --> 00:02.660
Previously...cooper is
trying for a clinical trial

00:02.670 --> 00:04.410
that might cure his son's M.S.

00:04.420 --> 00:06.610
- Do you even want to be in this trial?
- No.

00:06.620 --> 00:07.830
You involve yourself with my family,

00:07.840 --> 00:09.510
I'm gonna get involved with yours.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.850
I wanna be emancipated.

00:10.860 --> 00:12.450
You don't mess around with jim.

00:12.460 --> 00:14.930
Going against the
visions--it's risky.

00:15.940 --> 00:17.320
All right,let me see if I go rigthisht,

00:17.330 --> 00:19.030
cause it sounds like there
are two jim coopers here

00:19.040 --> 00:21.680
the one that you were practically
stalking to retain as a client

00:21.690 --> 00:22.700
I never stalked.

00:22.710 --> 00:25.750
Last week,and the jim cooper who
you're now making a mortal enemy of.

00:25.760 --> 00:27.980
And jordan's okay with this?

00:28.000 --> 00:29.150
Well,I wouldn't say that,

00:29.160 --> 00:32.320
but I wouldn't call
cooper an enemy either.

00:32.330 --> 00:33.600
Really? Okay,let's see.

00:33.610 --> 00:36.180
You got a court to green-light
his clinical trial last week,

00:36.190 --> 00:40.800
and this week you're helping
his son emancipate from him.

00:40.820 --> 00:43.980
Yeah,that guy's not sending you
a christmas card anytime soon.

00:43.990 --> 00:46.930
Well,I wouldn't expect one
from him either,if I were you.

00:47.230 --> 00:48.330
What?

00:48.340 --> 00:50.130
He said something about me?

00:50.190 --> 00:51.340
No,he just kind of,you know,

00:51.350 --> 00:52.660
uh,threatened to have you fired.

00:52.670 --> 00:55.740
But he--he was
just,like,blowing off steam.

00:56.010 --> 00:57.530
So getting me
fired,this is what--

00:57.540 --> 00:59.900
this is your idea of a birthday present?

01:00.930 --> 01:04.040
I would never ruin your birthday
or birthday golf for that matter.

01:04.050 --> 01:05.980
Can we please not call
it "birthday golf"?

01:05.990 --> 01:07.960
Because,you know,it makes me feel 6.

01:07.970 --> 01:09.740
And by the way,it is
something to worry about...

01:09.750 --> 01:12.010
my hospital--you know,the
place where I work--

01:12.020 --> 01:14.610
half the buildings there
are named after jim cooper.

01:14.900 --> 01:17.520
my case has got nothing to do with you.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.140
What? Eli,are you okay?

01:20.150 --> 01:23.870
You seem a little...a little drunk.

01:25.270 --> 01:27.310
Eli!ElI!

01:28.510 --> 01:30.340
wake up.

01:31.390 --> 01:33.690
Mr. Stone,are you okay?

01:37.310 --> 01:38.170
where am I?

01:38.180 --> 01:40.670
Maybe we should narrow
it down to a planet.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.460
Nate,come help your dad.

01:45.000 --> 01:47.530
You couldn't lay off
the liquor for one night?

01:47.550 --> 01:50.220
- Nate?
- You're ruining my party.

01:50.240 --> 01:51.270
It's your birthday?

01:51.280 --> 01:53.090
Oh,dad,your breath.

01:53.100 --> 01:56.440
- ElI,go make some coffee.
- Eli?

01:56.450 --> 01:59.060
This is why I didn't want to
have the party at the house.

01:59.070 --> 02:01.980
You promised this wasn't gonna happen.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.330
Hello? Dad!

02:04.880 --> 02:06.450
We betyor get u checked out.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.150
No,I'm just a little freaked out.

02:08.160 --> 02:11.590
I was dad. It's just gonna
take me a minute to recover.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.170
Let's hope you don't
get his hangover,too.

02:13.180 --> 02:15.380
I remember that birthday.He ruined it.

02:15.390 --> 02:17.080
Well,it's not like he
ruined it on purpose.

02:17.090 --> 02:18.770
No,no.My 10th and
11th birthdays--

02:18.780 --> 02:19.970
those he ruined on purpose.

02:19.980 --> 02:21.040
Why are you defending him?

02:21.050 --> 02:22.540
I'm not--I'm not
defending him.

02:22.550 --> 02:24.170
And your--your duties
as favorite son ended

02:24.180 --> 02:25.680
about ten years ago,you know?

02:25.690 --> 02:27.370
Okay,someone's still holding a grudge.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.710
It's my birthday.I'm entitled.

02:30.610 --> 02:31.880
are you insane?

02:31.890 --> 02:35.260
Because you're not going to represent
jim cooper's son.I forbid it.

02:35.270 --> 02:38.030
Are we still doing that?I
mean,we're partners now.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.280
Do we get to forbid?

02:40.420 --> 02:42.420
You look like your
aneurysm's gonna burst.

02:42.430 --> 02:43.780
That might have something
to do with the fact

02:43.790 --> 02:45.860
that I've been getting calls
from jim cooper all week.

02:45.870 --> 02:47.170
And every time he calls,

02:47.180 --> 02:49.550
I assure him that this nonsense is over.

02:49.560 --> 02:51.800
He's making idis k's life miserable.

02:51.810 --> 02:52.960
That's not our concern.

02:52.980 --> 02:54.330
We're partners now,eli.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.210
Our fates are intertwined.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.250
If cooper hears you utter
one more word to his son,

02:58.260 --> 02:59.570
he'll not only leave the firm,

02:59.580 --> 03:01.930
he'll let every present
and future client ow he left

03:01.940 --> 03:04.580
because his attorneys
meddled in his personal life,

03:04.590 --> 03:07.790
and this firm will be done
before it even started.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.720
What do you want me to do?

03:10.730 --> 03:12.960
When he comes in,you shake his hand,

03:12.970 --> 03:16.600
look appropriately humble
and apologize to the man.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.360
We're dropping this.

03:19.460 --> 03:21.480
Humbler.

03:24.260 --> 03:25.900
All right.

03:25.910 --> 03:27.800
let's get this over with.

03:28.770 --> 03:31.730
Mr. Cooper,um,I'm sorry

03:31.740 --> 03:34.310
if I have somehow offended you.

03:34.320 --> 03:36.230
- "Somehow"?
- You should know that

03:36.240 --> 03:39.930
we share the same primary
concern your son's welfare.

03:39.940 --> 03:42.630
And you should know that you
understand nothing about that.

03:42.640 --> 03:44.190
I think what eli's trying to say

03:44.200 --> 03:46.820
I don't care. You work for me.

03:46.840 --> 03:47.840
Do I,now?

03:47.850 --> 03:49.940
I can make sure the rest
of your career is spent

03:49.950 --> 03:53.030
taking court-appointed
cases at $75 a pop.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.050
I'm sure you
don't mean--

03:54.060 --> 03:56.840
I've got it within my power
to end your little venture here

03:56.850 --> 03:58.580
before it even gets off the ground,

03:58.590 --> 04:00.810
and if you want to prevent
that from happening,

04:00.820 --> 04:03.760
you will not only remove
mr. Stone from my sight,

04:03.770 --> 04:06.130
you will remove him fr the firm.

04:06.140 --> 04:07.870
Any questions?

04:07.880 --> 04:09.670
Just one.

04:09.680 --> 04:12.640
Do you remember your
way back to the elevator?

04:13.080 --> 04:16.690
This is my office,my firm,my building,

04:16.700 --> 04:20.190
and I will not be spoken to
like that within its walls.

04:20.610 --> 04:23.940
The only cooper we will be
representing is your son.

04:25.370 --> 04:28.110
You'll hear from my new
attorney later today.

04:35.010 --> 04:37.130
What happened to intertwined fates?

04:37.140 --> 04:39.260
I didn't enjoy his tone.

04:42.000 --> 04:43.310
- We have to talk.
- Okay.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.190
- Not here.
- Okay.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.340
You're a little bit crazy.You know this.

04:48.350 --> 04:49.700
you know what's going on out there?

04:49.720 --> 04:52.150
Everyone's whispering
behind closed doors.

04:52.160 --> 04:53.530
you're doing it without the door.

04:53.540 --> 04:55.830
Someone from here plugged
the leak at wethersby,

04:55.840 --> 04:57.500
and now they're all
looking for the snitch.

04:57.510 --> 04:59.520
The snitch?Ooh,I bet it was jimmy cagney

04:59.530 --> 05:01.070
no,this is serious.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.600
Our loyalty is being questioned

05:02.610 --> 05:04.530
because we have friends over there.

05:04.540 --> 05:08.520
I think you're being a
little paranoid. Hello?

05:09.280 --> 05:11.180
yes,she is.

05:11.710 --> 05:13.660
Of course.

05:14.590 --> 05:18.210
that was posner. He wantsto
see us in his office.

05:18.220 --> 05:20.710
Both of us? Suddenly?

05:20.720 --> 05:21.910
We're not working on anything together.

05:21.920 --> 05:23.660
Why does he suddenly need
to meet with both of us?

05:23.670 --> 05:26.390
Maybe a little paranoia is warranted.

05:28.200 --> 05:31.140
Scale of 1 to 10,how scary is your dad?

05:31.150 --> 05:32.220
- 9.
- 11.

05:32.230 --> 05:34.170
That averages out to a 10.

05:34.320 --> 05:36.400
This is just a sit-down
with his new lawyer.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.260
Emancipation's actually
pretty straightforward.

05:38.270 --> 05:40.500
There shouldn't be any surprises.

05:40.810 --> 05:44.190
Hey,sweetie.How's your day going so far?

Stone Season2 Episode6</font>

05:54.930 --> 05:56.180
So when I called you today

05:56.190 --> 05:57.350
and said,"what's lunch look like?"

05:57.360 --> 05:59.280
You didn't think this
was worth bringing up?

05:59.290 --> 06:00.890
I can't believe you're
representing this guy.

06:00.900 --> 06:03.220
A philanthropist who's
committed to changing the worl

06:03.240 --> 06:04.790
I know. It's almost hard to fathom.

06:04.800 --> 06:08.220
Perhaps if we could hear
exactly what J.J. Is looking for?

06:08.230 --> 06:10.290
Your new client has already heard.

06:10.400 --> 06:11.690
We want him to agree that J.J.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.290
Will not be forced
into his clinical trial.

06:14.300 --> 06:17.800
J.J. Will be permitted to stay at
his girlfriend's home until he has

06:17.810 --> 06:20.630
so his emancipation plan is
shack up with his girlfriend?

06:20.640 --> 06:24.100
Emancipation requires that J.J.
Proves he can support himself.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.370
His mother left him close to $100,000

06:26.380 --> 06:27.890
d title to various
real estate--

06:27.900 --> 06:29.460
anif J.J.'S M.S. Flares up,

06:29.470 --> 06:31.560
that money's gone inside
a year without insurance.

06:31.570 --> 06:33.460
Enough.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.340
All right,J.J.,You despise me.

06:35.350 --> 06:38.130
Noted. Now say good-bye to your
new friends and let's go home.

06:38.140 --> 06:40.540
Please advise your client to
address his comments to counsel.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.320
The clinical
trial,the swimming--

06:42.330 --> 06:44.270
we'll talk about all of it at home.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.160
I know what
that means--

06:46.170 --> 06:48.090
you talk,I listen.

06:50.470 --> 06:52.700
It's a disease,dad.

06:53.240 --> 06:55.310
There's nothing you can do about it,

06:55.320 --> 06:57.870
no matter how closely
you manage my life.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.000
We're not doing this in
front of other people.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.070
You're coming home with me.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.390
I think that's gonna
be left up to a judge.

07:14.250 --> 07:17.930
so...you guys still validate?

07:29.160 --> 07:31.160
- heY.
- Hey.

07:31.170 --> 07:32.580
Something I can help you with?

07:32.590 --> 07:33.960
Do we have new stationery yet?

07:33.970 --> 07:35.490
I'm still using the old W.P.K. Stuff,

07:35.500 --> 07:36.790
and I just cross out
the "p" and the "k,"

07:36.800 --> 07:38.380
but that's not really
professional,so--

07:38.390 --> 07:40.010
hey,there's angie.

07:40.020 --> 07:41.850
Um...

07:41.860 --> 07:42.930
- angie!
- Perfect.

07:42.940 --> 07:46.210
ElI! I was hi'd ing see you.Hey!

07:47.630 --> 07:50.270
eh,what's up,doc?

07:50.280 --> 07:51.780
Huh? I never get tired of saying that.

07:51.790 --> 07:53.340
Well,it never gets old,

07:53.350 --> 07:56.010
though you'd think it
would after 40 or 50 times.

07:56.020 --> 07:57.920
I know. Hey,keith,you,uh,

07:57.930 --> 07:59.670
you met patti's daughter?

08:00.770 --> 08:03.170
oh!  You do remember me.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.600
I thought you might have fallen,

08:04.610 --> 08:07.230
bumped your head,got
amnesia and forgot my number.

08:07.240 --> 08:08.750
I didn't realize you
two knew each other.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.470
Turns out we don'T.

08:10.480 --> 08:13.190
I thought keith was a brother who knew
a thing or two about follow-through,

08:13.200 --> 08:15.100
but that's not him at all.

08:15.110 --> 08:16.600
Well,I-I've been meaning to call.

08:16.610 --> 08:18.520
- I've just been swamped here.
- Yeah. It's true.

08:18.530 --> 08:21.370
He was just telling me about his
time-consuming stationery crisis.

08:21.380 --> 08:24.710
There you are!No stealing my lunch date.

08:24.720 --> 08:28.000
Wouldn't dare. Uh,good
seeing you again,angela.

08:28.650 --> 08:30.680
Before I forget,dr. Melvoy called.

08:30.690 --> 08:31.990
Is he ready to testify tomorrow?

08:32.000 --> 08:34.669
From st. Thomas?He's
on vacation for a month.

08:34.679 --> 08:36.669
He's like the third
expert to fly the coop.

08:36.679 --> 08:38.370
More like the coop-er.

08:38.390 --> 08:39.909
You mess with the bull,eli,

08:39.919 --> 08:41.270
you get the horns.

08:41.280 --> 08:42.450
If I don't find someone with "M.D."

08:42.460 --> 08:44.720
After their name to testify
that J.J.Calive on his own,

08:44.730 --> 08:46.440
he has to go back to daddy dearest.

08:46.450 --> 08:50.270
Well,if you can wait three more
years,you can have this one.

08:58.060 --> 09:00.130
pregnancy agrees with you.

09:00.150 --> 09:03.040
Send out an office-wide
e-mail,why don't you?

09:03.050 --> 09:05.810
You haven't told mr.
Dowd yet,I'm guessing.

09:05.820 --> 09:08.130
Matt thinks my morning
sickness is food poisoning.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.510
He keeps threatening
restaurants with lawsuits.

09:10.520 --> 09:11.810
If only there were an alternative

09:11.820 --> 09:14.510
to lying to the father
of your unborn child.

09:15.150 --> 09:16.920
You have to tell him
sometime,sweetheart.

09:16.930 --> 09:19.250
I'm just waiting for the right time.

09:19.270 --> 09:22.640
And that would be when,when
he notices your baby bump?

09:22.770 --> 09:24.340
All right,fine.Don't
listen to your father.

09:24.350 --> 09:26.350
Listen to your boss.

09:26.370 --> 09:29.330
You're litigating a
high-stakes,high-profile case.

09:29.340 --> 09:31.720
My pregnancy is not affecting my work.

09:31.730 --> 09:33.470
To even bring it up is actionable.

09:33.480 --> 09:35.590
It's not the pregnancy.It's the
fact that you're concealing it

09:35.600 --> 09:38.830
from the father of the baby who
happens to be opposing counsel.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.110
Which is irrelevant.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.560
You know it's not.

09:41.570 --> 09:44.220
I need you at 110%.

09:44.410 --> 09:47.020
And when you walk into court,look
across the aisle and see mr. Dowd,

09:47.030 --> 09:50.450
can you honestly tell
me you won't be wondering

09:50.460 --> 09:53.090
,"doeshe know? Should I tell him?"

09:53.770 --> 09:54.800
No.

09:54.810 --> 09:56.630
It's not fair to the client,

09:56.640 --> 09:58.940
not fair to the firm.

09:58.950 --> 10:01.830
And yes,this is your
father speaking again.

10:03.100 --> 10:06.870
It's not fair to
mr. Dowd--to matt.

10:07.410 --> 10:11.680
You're right.I'll--I'll
tell him this afternoon.

10:13.870 --> 10:15.480
Well,we knew it would happen eventually.

10:15.490 --> 10:18.540
It was just a matter of time before
we went up against our ex-coworkers.

10:18.550 --> 10:20.500
- Matt
- granted,it's taylor and eli,

10:20.510 --> 10:21.810
but we know them intimately.

10:21.830 --> 10:24.800
Well,half intimately.Did
you and stone ever...

10:24.810 --> 10:26.890
I have to tell you.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.250
I plugged the le.

10:28.260 --> 10:29.710
Is that a euphemism?

10:29.720 --> 10:32.960
Last week... I gave
eli the name of the guy

10:32.970 --> 10:36.230
who was spilling all that
inside info to our firm.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.290
- Idiot.
- It was the right thing to do!

10:38.300 --> 10:40.420
No,not you. Me.

10:40.440 --> 10:42.810
I thought posner gave us this
case as a vote of confidence.

10:42.820 --> 10:46.510
He gavit to us as a test of our loyalty.

10:46.520 --> 10:48.600
Well,I told you they were...

10:49.930 --> 10:50.830
what?

10:50.840 --> 10:53.440
What is she doing here?

10:54.220 --> 10:56.710
look,we win the case,

10:56.720 --> 10:57.930
we pass the test.

10:57.940 --> 11:00.000
Simple.

11:01.620 --> 11:04.920
- Hey,you.
- Hey.

11:08.070 --> 11:10.110
What,you don't want to
be seen kissing the enemy?

11:10.120 --> 11:11.680
What? No.

11:11.690 --> 11:12.710
What are you doing here?

11:12.720 --> 11:14.370
I brought you
some discovery--

11:14.380 --> 11:15.400
J.J.'S school records.

11:15.410 --> 11:16.750
Things must really be tight over there

11:16.760 --> 11:19.560
if you guys are cutting
back on courier service now.

11:20.250 --> 11:22.270
I thought maybe we could talk.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.800
Like about how you talked
some sense into your client?

11:25.130 --> 11:26.130
Excuse me?

11:26.140 --> 11:28.090
Come on,taylor,this is a grudge match

11:28.100 --> 11:29.460
between your father and cooper.

11:29.470 --> 11:31.030
The kid is 16,and he's sick.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.670
He's got no business
trying to emancipate.

11:33.680 --> 11:37.600
Right,because it couldn't possibly be
that the father is a controlling bully

11:37.610 --> 11:41.100
who treats his son like a damaged
piece of expensive furniture.

11:41.120 --> 11:42.580
Are you kidding me?

11:42.590 --> 11:44.800
The guy built a whole
laboratory downtown

11:44.810 --> 11:47.260
for the sole purpose of
finding a cure for his son.

11:47.270 --> 11:49.960
When I'm a dad,I hope
I'm that kind of a bully.

11:51.160 --> 11:52.400
You know what?

11:52.410 --> 11:53.550
You're right.

11:53.560 --> 11:55.190
I should've sent a courier.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.130
Okay.

11:57.420 --> 11:58.800
I need something from you.

11:58.810 --> 12:00.470
Oh. Imagine my surprise.

12:00.480 --> 12:02.610
It's not like you ever
stop by just to say hi.

12:02.620 --> 12:05.920
I think you're s posedto be my
medical expert in the J.J. Cooper case.

12:05.930 --> 12:07.730
Eli,you said you were
gonna keep me out of this.

12:07.740 --> 12:09.550
You said this case had
nothing to do with me.

12:09.560 --> 12:11.900
I might have been wrong about that.

12:11.910 --> 12:12.830
My vision the
other day--

12:12.840 --> 12:16.790
how happy do you think my
hospital is with me right now?

12:16.970 --> 12:19.290
I'm the guy who helped you
sue the hospital last year

12:19.300 --> 12:20.870
and the chairman of
the board last month.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.000
And you were right both times.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.460
You're changing people's lives,nate.

12:24.470 --> 12:26.090
At the expense of my own.

12:26.100 --> 12:27.240
My vision the
other day--

12:27.250 --> 12:30.440
I-I was at your 12th
birthday as dad,okay?

12:30.450 --> 12:31.900
J.J. Is suing his dad.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.880
I'm not sure that bringing dad into
this is the way you want to go here.

12:34.890 --> 12:36.110
You know how this works,nate.

12:36.120 --> 12:40.350
I wouldn't ask you to do this unless I
believed that someone was asking me to.

12:49.890 --> 12:51.050
According to his medical records,

12:51.060 --> 12:52.820
J.J. Is asymptomatic.

12:52.830 --> 12:54.670
Which in layman's terms means...

12:54.680 --> 12:56.710
that he hasn't had an M.S. Episode,

12:56.720 --> 12:59.650
uh,since the one that led
to his diagnosis a year ago,

12:59.660 --> 13:02.270
and more importantly,R.I.S
ntinue to show

13:02.280 --> 13:05.400
no significant lesions along
his spinal cord or brain stem.

13:05.410 --> 13:07.320
and if he does develop symptoms?

13:07.340 --> 13:11.290
Well,odds are they would be
minor--uh,tremors,fatigue.

13:11.300 --> 13:14.080
M.S. Is a progressive disease,

13:14.090 --> 13:15.450
and that's what
these M.R.I.S track--

13:15.460 --> 13:16.960
the progress of the disease.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.370
Now fortunately,

13:18.380 --> 13:21.580
J.J.'S M.R.I.S seem to
indicate that it's very slow.

13:21.590 --> 13:25.420
And what does that mean in terms of his
petition to become an emancipated minor?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.850
Well,medically speaking,it's irrelevant.

13:26.860 --> 13:29.660
There are 400,000
americans living with M.S.,

13:29.670 --> 13:34.340
And management of the disease is
the same whether you're 16 or 60.

13:36.940 --> 13:41.690
Except a 60-year-old can
drive, vote,drink,join the army.

13:41.700 --> 13:44.780
We'll stipulate there are
differences between minors and adults.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.080
That's kind of why we're all here.

13:46.090 --> 13:48.700
Motor dysfunction,paralysis--aren't
those symptoms of M.S.

13:48.710 --> 13:50.700
That can get worse
without any remission?

13:50.710 --> 13:53.760
Yeah,but J.J. Has yet to show
any signs of those symptoms.

13:53.770 --> 13:56.560
And you're basing that
on a thorough examination?

13:56.570 --> 13:58.730
I've reviewed his records extensively.

13:58.740 --> 14:04.070
Well,he's got doctors who've
actually examined him...extensively.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.920
Just out of curiosity,
why do you suppose

14:05.930 --> 14:08.160
J.J.'S own doctors say he is

14:08.170 --> 14:11.760
definitively better off
under his father's care?

14:13.360 --> 14:18.350
Even at the best
hospitals...money buys influence.

14:18.500 --> 14:21.620
And doctors tend to tell jim cooper
what jim cooper wants to hear.

14:21.630 --> 14:24.910
Objection--assuming facts not in
evidence and generally paranoid.

14:24.920 --> 14:25.920
Sustained.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.410
Let me ask
you directly--

14:27.420 --> 14:29.710
is it possible that J.J. Could suffer

14:29.720 --> 14:32.980
an M.S. Flare-up tomorrow
that could so disable him,

14:32.990 --> 14:34.500
he couldn't care for himself?

14:34.510 --> 14:35.290
It's not likely.

14:35.300 --> 14:37.500
Except I asked if it was possible.

14:37.830 --> 14:39.210
Anything is possible.

14:39.220 --> 14:42.850
Maybe that's why the law generally
favors kids staying with their parents.

14:49.020 --> 14:51.020
Keith,you have a minute?

14:51.030 --> 14:53.300
I really need to file a motion.

14:53.890 --> 14:57.700
I'm really not one to interfere
in my daughter's personal life--

14:57.710 --> 14:59.590
guess that depends on
whether you consider

14:59.600 --> 15:02.180
threatening to shank me with
a butter knife "interfering."

15:02.190 --> 15:03.970
Fair enough.

15:03.980 --> 15:05.510
but you did take her to dinner,

15:05.520 --> 15:08.110
and there was no butter knife shankG.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.440
Yeah,I was happy about that.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.720
I really gotta do that
thing with the motion.

15:11.730 --> 15:16.100
Ah! Why haven't you called my daughter?

15:16.120 --> 15:18.380
I' just been so
slammed.I--you know,uh...

15:18.390 --> 15:21.050
tell me the truth.

15:21.480 --> 15:24.110
Really,I-I've just been slammed.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.100
But I'll call her.

15:26.290 --> 15:28.250
I will.

15:36.600 --> 15:38.430
Eli,can we talk?

15:38.510 --> 15:39.890
Um,is it something that can wait

15:39.900 --> 15:43.370
until after matt and
maggie kick my ass in court?

15:43.380 --> 15:45.430
Not really.It's about angela.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.240
- Is she okay?
- Oh,she's fine.

15:47.260 --> 15:48.760
But I was talking to keith about her,

15:48.770 --> 15:50.440
and I think she's hiding something.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.150
You know I'm half psychic.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.660
- yeah? Which half?
- What?

15:55.780 --> 15:58.680
I said,which half of you is psychic?

15:58.690 --> 16:01.240
Eli,have you been drinking?

16:01.250 --> 16:02.300
Come on!

16:02.310 --> 16:05.140
Oh,I'm gonna get you some
aspirin. Drink some water.

16:05.150 --> 16:05.970
- Eli!
- Huh?

16:05.980 --> 16:07.870
Drink the water.

16:17.990 --> 16:19.310
dad?

16:20.340 --> 16:22.220
dad,wake up.

16:31.360 --> 16:32.890
uh,what happened?

16:32.900 --> 16:34.950
You were trying to read
something in your book,

16:34.960 --> 16:37.140
and then you passed out.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.030
what's going on?

16:44.040 --> 16:45.520
Where's the cake?

16:45.530 --> 16:46.840
Uh,the cake?

16:46.850 --> 16:49.500
You were supposed to
pick up the birthday cake.

16:49.770 --> 16:52.100
Perfect. First you scare
the crap out of my friends

16:52.110 --> 16:54.720
by passing out in front of
'em,and now you forget the cake?

16:54.730 --> 16:57.150
There's still time. He
can still get a cake.

16:57.170 --> 16:59.060
- Right,dad?
- Yeah,sure.

16:59.070 --> 17:00.190
Everyone's going home!

17:00.200 --> 17:03.800
Stop yelling at him. He just
wanted to show me something.

17:04.310 --> 17:05.890
You mean this?

17:05.900 --> 17:08.690
What the hell is so important
about a crappy notebook?

17:08.700 --> 17:10.250
I-I need to see that.

17:10.270 --> 17:12.910
"Dear eli..."remember this,eli.

17:12.920 --> 17:15.520
Eli's gift." His gift!

17:15.730 --> 17:18.880
You know,maybe you should have just
pretended it was eli's birthday.

17:18.890 --> 17:21.130
Then maybe you would
have remembered the cake.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.829
it's gone,eli.

17:23.839 --> 17:25.079
Are you sure?

17:25.089 --> 17:27.329
You threw the journal
into a flaming barbecue.

17:27.339 --> 17:28.720
Yeah,I'm pretty sure.

17:28.730 --> 17:31.370
I don't know. I just thought
that maybe after I left,

17:31.380 --> 17:33.700
you know,part of the book surviD.

17:33.710 --> 17:35.310
You were right to get rid of it,bro.

17:35.320 --> 17:37.650
It's dangerous to know too much.

17:37.660 --> 17:39.960
But now I don't know the
things i'm supposed to know.

17:40.760 --> 17:42.770
This latest vision was about the book.

17:42.790 --> 17:45.970
My dad was obviously writing
something pretty important in there,

17:45.980 --> 17:47.000
and I couldn't read it.

17:47.010 --> 17:49.550
Well,what do you think
god's trying to tell you?

17:49.560 --> 17:52.050
I don't know. It's like he's
teasing me with these visions.

17:52.060 --> 17:54.150
Ey're getting more and more oblique.

17:54.170 --> 17:57.420
Eli,last week he told you
don't mess around with jim.

17:57.430 --> 17:58.480
He sung it to you.

17:58.490 --> 17:59.560
It couldn't have been clearer.

17:59.580 --> 18:01.130
And you chose to defy him.

18:01.140 --> 18:02.310
Okay,true.

18:02.320 --> 18:03.990
But he also sent the
burning building vision,

18:04.000 --> 18:05.550
and that one went nowhere.

18:05.560 --> 18:06.640
Give it time,eli.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.690
We're on his schedule.

18:07.700 --> 18:10.820
He's not on ours.

18:15.860 --> 18:17.720
hey,jack.

18:17.810 --> 18:21.710
Mr. Dowd... bearing gifts.

18:21.720 --> 18:24.800
Tokens of my appreciation
for your amazing daughter.

18:24.810 --> 18:27.210
Delivered in pson,no less.

18:27.230 --> 18:30.100
I'm sure you heard
about our l-little...

18:30.110 --> 18:31.300
I have.

18:31.310 --> 18:34.240
I figured it's the least I can do.

18:34.250 --> 18:36.560
Let me be the first
to say congratulations.

18:36.570 --> 18:40.590
What father doesn't harbor the
dream of one day being a grandfather?

18:42.100 --> 18:45.250
- Oh,dear god.
- Oh,my god.

18:45.430 --> 18:47.320
Okay,so to recap,

18:47.330 --> 18:49.690
- you're saying taylor -
is--you--you didn't know?

18:49.700 --> 18:51.220
Not so much,no.

18:51.230 --> 18:53.030
This is not how you were
supposed to find out.

18:53.040 --> 18:53.410
You think?

18:53.420 --> 18:55.650
It's just she told me
she was going to tell you,

18:55.660 --> 18:57.230
and now you're here carrying gifts,

18:57.240 --> 18:59.890
and that's a bear,for god's sake!

18:59.900 --> 19:04.490
It's an apology bear for
pissing her off earlier today.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.860
It appears I'll be needing
the name of your florist.

19:08.090 --> 19:10.070
do you have any idea what you've done?

19:10.080 --> 19:11.300
The board is furious.

19:11.310 --> 19:14.180
Doctors in this hospital
testify in cases all the time.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.160
Not against its biggest donor.

19:16.170 --> 19:18.650
I thought that money just bought him
his name on the side of a building,

19:18.660 --> 19:20.300
not the right to bully and intimidate.

19:20.310 --> 19:22.270
No one has been bullied or intimidated.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.140
Then what's this little
chat we're having now?

19:24.150 --> 19:26.240
It's a friendly warning.

19:37.330 --> 19:38.450
Frank.

19:38.460 --> 19:40.480
- Is eli okay?
- Yeah.

19:40.490 --> 19:42.000
This is about his case.

19:42.010 --> 19:44.250
I gave my pound of flesh this morning.

19:44.260 --> 19:46.930
You need to go back tomorrow.

19:46.940 --> 19:49.110
Eli doesn't know it, but you do.

19:49.120 --> 19:52.160
You got a tarot card that says so?

19:52.330 --> 19:54.290
It's in the book.

19:54.300 --> 19:55.870
My father's book?

19:55.880 --> 19:57.980
The book that eli told me he burned?

19:57.990 --> 20:00.420
I came to tell you in confidence.

20:00.430 --> 20:01.610
You need to go back.

20:01.620 --> 20:05.140
Your dad wanted you in
that courtroom tomorrow.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.910
If I get
sick--sicker--

20:11.920 --> 20:13.920
I've got a
support system--

20:13.930 --> 20:18.460
friends,doctors,my coach and his family,

20:18.470 --> 20:20.870
um,my girlfriend
jen and hers--

20:20.880 --> 20:22.480
none of those people is your father.

20:22.490 --> 20:24.390
Right--my
father,

20:24.400 --> 20:27.450
who offered my girlfriend
$25,000 to leave me alone.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.550
He said that she was a
distraction from my getting well.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.080
My father who--who filled
in our swimming pool

20:33.090 --> 20:35.710
when I said that I didn't want to
be a part of his clinical study.

20:35.720 --> 20:40.050
If I stay with him, the only
thing I'd have left is M.S.

20:40.760 --> 20:43.580
Your honor,I'd like
permission to allow mr. Cooper

20:43.590 --> 20:46.010
to engage this witness
directly on cross.

20:46.020 --> 20:47.010
- Objection!
- Excuse me?

20:47.020 --> 20:48.830
Your honor,there is precedent for this.

20:48.840 --> 20:50.260
On "judge judy," maybe.

20:50.270 --> 20:54.040
Mr. Cooper would merely be exercising
his right to self-representation.

20:54.050 --> 20:56.970
Which is a little difficult,since
he's not representing himself.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.890
Knock it off.No one
yells in here but me.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.960
You,girlie. Go.

21:02.970 --> 21:05.060
If J.J. Wants you to
declare him an adult,

21:05.070 --> 21:08.030
he should at least demonstrate
the ability to withstand a question

21:08.040 --> 21:08.960
or two from his father.

21:08.970 --> 21:10.540
Your honor,this is such a blatant stunt.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.480
She should be dressed as evel knievel.

21:12.490 --> 21:16.370
My court,my discretion,mr. Stone.

21:21.640 --> 21:23.550
How you feeling,jimmy?

21:24.460 --> 21:26.190
Ready for this to be over?

21:26.200 --> 21:27.950
Yes,sir.

21:27.960 --> 21:32.090
Yourwim coach,your
girlfriend's family...

21:32.100 --> 21:33.520
do you really think any of them

21:33.530 --> 21:36.500
care about you as much as I do?

21:36.520 --> 21:38.820
You care too much,dad.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.690
When you're a father,

21:40.700 --> 21:43.270
you'll see that's not possible.

21:43.280 --> 21:44.840
Mom didn't think so.

21:44.850 --> 21:48.210
Do you understand that
I kept your mother alive

21:48.220 --> 21:50.710
six months longer than any
doctor said she would live?

21:50.720 --> 21:53.380
And she hated every minute of it,

21:53.390 --> 21:55.390
and she hated you.

21:55.400 --> 21:57.750
You need to let  go,dad.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.230
I... I can take care of myself.

22:00.240 --> 22:02.700
Are you sure about that?

22:03.400 --> 22:06.470
Let's talk about the
week I was in japan.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.740
You stayed with your coach

22:07.760 --> 22:10.360
- can we be done?I want to be done.
- Your honor?

22:10.370 --> 22:12.800
I got a phone call in
the middle of the night

22:12.810 --> 22:15.830
from an emergency room
thousands of miles away.

22:16.260 --> 22:17.510
Why were you there?

22:17.520 --> 22:18.750
It was an accident.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.090
Three painkillers is an accident.

22:21.100 --> 22:23.920
You take 12,and it's something else.

22:23.930 --> 22:25.940
That was one night.

22:25.950 --> 22:27.890
- I'd just been diagnosed.
- You got scared.

22:27.900 --> 22:30.330
I get it.You panicked.

22:30.340 --> 22:32.460
Do you remember what you said
to me when you got on the phone?

22:32.470 --> 22:34.760
This is hearsay and completely inhumane.

22:34.770 --> 22:37.660
You said,"why did you
leave me alone,dad?

22:37.670 --> 22:39.540
- I can't be alone."
- do something.

22:39.550 --> 22:41.640
You don't like me? That's fine.

22:41.650 --> 22:44.650
You're hardly the first
16-year-old who hates his father.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.950
But it doesn't mean that you can
take care of yourself when you can'T.

22:47.960 --> 22:50.020
Your honor,you can hold
me in contempt if you wt,

22:50.030 --> 22:51.780
but I'm taking my client
off the stand right now.

22:51.790 --> 22:53.610
- My client isn't finished.
- Yes,he is!

22:53.620 --> 22:56.590
Well?Are we done here,or am I
gonna see the inside of a ll?

22:56.610 --> 22:59.000
We'll take a short recess.

23:02.920 --> 23:03.710
- open court,maggie.
- Real nice.

23:03.720 --> 23:05.460
That was the most disgusting
thing I've ever seen in open court.

23:05.470 --> 23:07.020
- How the hell could you sign off on that?
- Sign off on it?

23:07.030 --> 23:08.660
- It was my idea!
- Don't be so surprised things got a little messy.

23:08.670 --> 23:09.830
Save the righteous indignation.

23:09.840 --> 23:11.030
You would've done the same thing.

23:11.040 --> 23:14.060
I would never subject a kid to
that kind of public humiliation!

23:14.070 --> 23:15.530
Well,at least you're
admitting he's a kid.

23:15.540 --> 23:18.160
It was unfair surprise,the
textbook definition!

23:18.170 --> 23:19.320
Well,you'd be the expert.

23:19.330 --> 23:20.420
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

23:20.430 --> 23:24.100
I don't know. How about
you pregnant with my kid?

23:26.160 --> 23:27.620
- I'm so happy for you.
- Taylor,that's amazing.

23:27.630 --> 23:29.680
You know what? Not so
amazing when you're the father

23:29.690 --> 23:31.900
and you find out about
it from your ex-boss.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.590
I was just trying to find
the right moment to tell you.

23:33.600 --> 23:35.780
Sure,like,uh, when he,uh,was born

23:35.790 --> 23:38.870
or took his first steps
or got into college!

23:41.510 --> 23:45.430
- Eli
- oh,we're done here,counselor.

23:47.870 --> 23:49.120
Did you see it?

23:49.140 --> 23:51.330
Maggie embracing the dark
side?Yeah,front-row seat.

23:51.340 --> 23:54.080
No,no. J.J.When he was on
the stand,he was shaking.

23:54.090 --> 23:54.710
Of course he was shaking.

23:54.720 --> 23:56.310
His dad was going
after him in open court.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.120
No,he was shaking,eli.

23:59.130 --> 24:00.980
His hand.

24:19.530 --> 24:21.960
There was a tremor.

24:21.970 --> 24:23.660
First you're pissed I don't call,

24:23.670 --> 24:26.220
then you ignore me when I do.

24:26.720 --> 24:29.200
Your mom told me where to find you.

24:29.220 --> 24:32.640
I'm sorr I-I went radio silent.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.350
There's something I wanted
to talk to you about.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.680
Is that sam & dave?

24:40.920 --> 24:42.210
I love this song.

24:42.220 --> 24:45.620
Don't pretend you know
anything about sam & dave.

24:45.990 --> 24:52.450
please.Sam moore and dave
prater--the real blues brothers.

24:52.460 --> 24:56.270
That music got me through the bar exam.

25:00.270 --> 25:02.530
growing up,I used to dance.

25:02.800 --> 25:04.720
Now when I'm stressed,

25:04.730 --> 25:07.720
I put these brothers on,and I just move.

25:21.710 --> 25:23.670
I'm--I'm
sorry,angela.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.800
We--we really
need to talk.

25:27.810 --> 25:30.770
That's never a good
conversation starter.

25:34.370 --> 25:35.820
a-after your D.U.I.

25:35.830 --> 25:37.070
Was dropped,

25:37.080 --> 25:39.470
I got a call from the A.D.A.

25:40.920 --> 25:44.550
Your blood work came
back positive for cocaine.

25:45.250 --> 25:47.120
I-I'm afraid you might ve a problem.

25:47.130 --> 25:51.980
What? Too much sam & dave
while you were in law school?

25:51.990 --> 25:54.600
You forget innocent until proven guilty?

25:54.610 --> 25:56.260
I'm not accusing you of anything.

25:56.270 --> 25:57.910
No,the D.A. Was.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.130
You were just too happy to believe her.

26:00.140 --> 26:01.220
Angela,it's not like that.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.950
Listen,I know
some folks--

26:03.970 --> 26:06.810
amoxicillin--the
antibiotic.

26:06.820 --> 26:08.600
Any first-year med
student will tell you

26:08.610 --> 26:12.630
that taking this will give you
a false positive for cocaine.

26:12.790 --> 26:17.280
I have an ear infection,
not a drug problem.

26:17.440 --> 26:18.540
I'm sorry,angela.

26:18.550 --> 26:20.870
A-angela! I'm sorry!

26:20.880 --> 26:22.970
Not more than me.

26:25.230 --> 26:28.570
J.J. Has at least two complete
lesions along his brain stem.

26:28.590 --> 26:31.570
You look at the number
of lesions and the size--

26:31.580 --> 26:32.730
they couldn't have formed overnight.

26:32.740 --> 26:33.760
He gets a new M.R.I.

26:33.770 --> 26:36.050
Every few weeks,and no
one spotted any of this?

26:36.060 --> 26:37.910
Well,actually,I think they did.

26:37.920 --> 26:40.210
I looked at all of J.J.'S old M.R.I.S,

26:40.220 --> 26:43.840
and I think they stopped filing
new ones about three months ago.

26:43.850 --> 26:46.360
Instead,someone simply
copied an old M.R.I.

26:46.370 --> 26:48.000
From when he was asymptomatic

26:48.010 --> 26:52.430
and filed it with a new date repeatedly.

26:52.450 --> 26:54.880
So they could claim he was asymptomatic?

26:55.670 --> 26:58.030
And the records would back 'em up.

27:01.530 --> 27:03.420
it's getting worse,isn't it?

27:03.430 --> 27:04.570
You knew?

27:04.580 --> 27:07.330
I figured,when you asked me to stop by.

27:07.340 --> 27:10.800
My dad kept telling me I was fine.

27:10.810 --> 27:15.840
For months I felt tired
and...all over now.

27:15.850 --> 27:18.590
Nate,could you give us a minute?

27:22.200 --> 27:25.670
Hey,nothing's over,okay?

27:25.680 --> 27:28.460
People live long,full
lives with this disease.

27:28.470 --> 27:30.500
They manage it.

27:30.510 --> 27:32.460
They don't qualify for the olympics.

27:38.630 --> 27:40.480
I know what you're going through.

27:40.490 --> 27:43.410
You feel like you lost
control of your life,mm?

27:43.550 --> 27:45.450
The day my aneurysm was diagnosed,

27:45.460 --> 27:47.430
I-I went back to my apartment,

27:47.440 --> 27:51.920
and in the mail were all
these bills,magazines.

27:51.930 --> 27:53.650
That was the most terrifying part.

27:53.660 --> 27:54.850
Uh,you know,I was dying,

27:54.860 --> 28:00.010
but the world kept going
like nothing had changed.

28:00.200 --> 28:01.690
What did you do?

28:01.700 --> 28:04.400
I paid the bills.

28:04.800 --> 28:07.590
you ever stop being scared?

28:07.600 --> 28:09.420
No.

28:09.670 --> 28:12.340
But I don't stop living,either.

28:13.080 --> 28:14.090
That's what life is.

28:14.100 --> 28:17.130
You just--you gotta
keep moving forward,

28:17.660 --> 28:19.240
even when you know that there is

28:19.250 --> 28:23.660
some bad stuff waiting
for you years or weeks,

28:23.670 --> 28:26.460
maybe days,down the road.

28:26.470 --> 28:28.610
You keep moving forward.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.760
'Cause even when you think
you know what's gonna happen,

28:32.830 --> 28:35.130
it doesn't always.

28:35.560 --> 28:38.420
That's what hope is made of.

28:42.540 --> 28:43.840
Still not sure what I'm doing here.

28:43.850 --> 28:46.250
Yeah,in a minute you're gonna
be nostalgic for that feeling.

28:46.260 --> 28:46.930
what are we looking at?

28:46.940 --> 28:49.330
J.J.'S
medical files--

28:49.340 --> 28:52.550
fraudulent one on the
left,real one on the right.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.020
- oh,my god.
- wait a minute.Fraudulent?

28:55.030 --> 28:56.620
This looks like his M.S. Has advanced.

28:56.630 --> 28:58.620
- because it has.
- you saw this?

28:58.630 --> 29:01.690
We're no longer in court.Do
not address my client.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.040
I can't be here.

29:04.060 --> 29:05.180
I want to talk to my son.

29:05.190 --> 29:07.200
Sit down!

29:08.620 --> 29:10.550
Fake M.R.I.S.

29:10.560 --> 29:11.720
How do you fake an M.R.I.?

29:11.730 --> 29:15.020
It helps to have big chunks of a
hospital with your name on them.

29:15.030 --> 29:16.700
You figured out why you're here yet?

29:16.710 --> 29:18.370
Why wouldn't you tell your
son he's getting worse?

29:18.380 --> 29:21.020
He did not want to
jeopardize his clinical trial.

29:21.030 --> 29:22.540
This was never about money.

29:22.550 --> 29:25.870
Yeah,well,maybe not for you,but for
the hospital,it sure as hell was.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.210
I spent a year
of my life--

29:28.230 --> 29:29.830
a year of
J.J.'S life--

29:29.840 --> 29:31.920
pushing that clinical
trial through the F.D.A.

29:31.930 --> 29:33.780
Using him,your own son,as a prop,

29:33.790 --> 29:35.820
your--your emotional
poster child.

29:35.830 --> 29:37.810
Which is why you needed
to hide his symptoms,

29:37.820 --> 29:39.440
because under F.D.A guidelines,

29:39.450 --> 29:41.980
it would have disqualified
him from the study.

29:41.990 --> 29:45.450
I did it for him...to cure him.

29:45.460 --> 29:48.520
I'm gonna advise you to stop talking.

29:50.650 --> 29:51.920
So what do we  here?

29:51.930 --> 29:54.460
Well,first of all,you're gonna
agree to J.J.'S emancipation,

29:54.470 --> 29:56.180
and then you're gonna
cut him a sizable check

29:56.190 --> 29:58.200
to cover his living
expenses and medical costs.

29:58.210 --> 29:59.930
And you're gonna go to the hospital,

29:59.940 --> 30:01.740
and you're gonna
clean house--

30:01.750 --> 30:05.930
unless you want me to go to the D.A.With
a list of the laws that you've broken.

30:09.280 --> 30:13.060
I'll...talk to the board.

30:15.320 --> 30:17.940
Hi.I understand there was a
breakthrgh in the cooper case.

30:17.950 --> 30:19.860
I'm not here about the cooper case.

30:19.870 --> 30:23.190
I specifically asked you
not to say anything to matt.

30:23.200 --> 30:25.230
There was a chocolate bear!

30:26.040 --> 30:27.890
Maybe you did me a favor.

30:27.900 --> 30:30.560
This way,I got the disaster over with.

30:30.570 --> 30:31.720
Was it really that bad?

30:31.730 --> 30:32.740
It wasn't pretty.

30:32.750 --> 30:33.870
What kind of man would he be

30:33.880 --> 30:36.790
if he wasn't upset that
you kept this from him?

30:36.800 --> 30:38.770
Are you sure that's
how you want to go here?

30:38.780 --> 30:41.190
You had more than enough
time in which to tell him.

30:41.200 --> 30:43.450
Why didn't you?

30:43.640 --> 30:46.590
When eli and I broke up,I needed...

30:47.160 --> 30:49.430
I needed someone who wasn't eli.

30:49.450 --> 30:52.480
I don't know anyone who fits
that description better than matt

30:52.490 --> 30:56.650
,but he was never supposed to
be anything more than a break,

30:56.660 --> 30:59.830
a relationship palate-cleanser.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.040
Things have changed.

31:02.510 --> 31:04.050
Yeah.

31:05.140 --> 31:07.840
Just when I think this
job can't get any harder,

31:07.850 --> 31:10.960
I have to help a kid
process the fact that

31:10.970 --> 31:14.630
his life has just vanished
out from under him.

31:14.640 --> 31:15.880
It's a calling.

31:15.890 --> 31:19.040
- What?
- You called it a job.

31:19.050 --> 31:20.130
It's a calling.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.330
Well,sometimes that's
what it feels like--

31:22.650 --> 31:26.030
a really important job with a boss
who everyone else thinks is great,

31:26.040 --> 31:28.450
but I can't figure out where
he's taking the company.

31:29.470 --> 31:32.770
I thought you'd embraced the master
plan of it all a little more,eli.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.780
And I have. I'm trying
to be a good soldier.

31:35.790 --> 31:39.040
Except for when you weren't--
messing around with jim

31:39.050 --> 31:41.120
when god specifically told you not to.

31:41.130 --> 31:42.890
Well,turns out that's a little unclear.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.440
I wasn't supposed to
mess around with jim,

31:44.450 --> 31:46.400
but I won the case anyway,

31:46.410 --> 31:50.730
both of
'em--cooper's and J...

31:51.520 --> 31:53.750
- J.J.'S.
- What?

31:53.760 --> 31:56.460
J.J.--James
junior.

31:56.470 --> 31:58.830
Jim junior,as in,

31:58.840 --> 32:00.060
"don't mess around with."

32:00.070 --> 32:02.610
My vision last week I
must have missed something.

32:02.830 --> 32:05.030
I-I need to see it again,frank.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.840
Lie back on the table.

32:20.770 --> 32:23.410
hey! Hey,you!

32:23.420 --> 32:25.840
You've gotta get out of there!

32:25.880 --> 32:28.490
J.J.!

32:32.110 --> 32:33.160
What did you see

32:33.170 --> 32:34.960
hello,mrs. Phillips? Hi.

32:34.970 --> 32:36.370
Uh,my name is eli stone.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.880
I'm J.J.'S lawyer.

32:37.890 --> 32:39.940
Um,I need to speak with him.

32:39.950 --> 32:42.100
I was hoping he was with jen.

32:42.110 --> 32:44.740
How long has he been missing?

32:45.010 --> 32:46.910
Call
9-1-1.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.350
J.J.!

33:19.790 --> 33:21.400
J.J.! Hey. Look at me!

33:21.410 --> 33:23.030
Look at me!Hey!

33:23.040 --> 33:24.480
We gotta get outta here!

33:24.500 --> 33:26.480
Now,okay?

33:26.930 --> 33:29.190
come on,this way!Come on,let's go!

33:49.930 --> 33:54.800
I didn't think the fire
would spread so fast.

33:55.380 --> 33:56.470
I don't think that was the problem

33:56.480 --> 33:59.320
so much as starting the
fire in the first place.

33:59.330 --> 34:01.320
What were you doing?

34:01.330 --> 34:03.840
Were--were you trying
to hurt yourself?

34:05.370 --> 34:08.030
I don't know how I ended up there.

34:08.159 --> 34:11.739
I was walking and thinking...

34:12.540 --> 34:15.610
he took the most important thing
in my whole life away from me.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.000
And you wanted to do the same to him?

34:20.010 --> 34:21.600
What happens now?

34:21.610 --> 34:24.870
You're gonna talk to
a guy--psychiatrist.

34:24.880 --> 34:27.480
There aren't gonna be any charges filed.

34:27.840 --> 34:30.570
Dad used his influence again?

34:30.580 --> 34:32.560
Mr. Control freak.

34:32.570 --> 34:36.139
Maybe he tries to control
what and who he cares about.

34:36.150 --> 34:37.880
What,are you on his side now?

34:37.889 --> 34:41.030
The court says you're an adult now,J.J.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.230
You want to be an adult?

34:43.239 --> 34:45.040
You gotta realize that
there aren't any sides.

34:45.060 --> 34:47.380
It's just people.

34:47.389 --> 34:49.900
You got some challenges ahead of you.

34:51.130 --> 34:53.850
You might not think
that you need your dad,

34:54.100 --> 34:56.340
but one day you might want him.

34:58.660 --> 35:01.770
And when you do,you don't
want it to be too late.

35:10.570 --> 35:12.600
Hey,thanks.

35:45.330 --> 35:47.400
Maybe I'm a jerk.

35:48.650 --> 35:51.150
Well,maybe I'm a coward.

35:51.860 --> 35:53.940
- we just need toigure this
- can we talk?

35:53.960 --> 35:55.600
Ladies first.

35:55.610 --> 35:57.190
Look,I should've told you,

35:57.200 --> 35:58.650
but I was afraid,

35:58.670 --> 36:01.630
you know,of this conversation,

36:02.600 --> 36:04.820
talking about us,you know.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.840
Let's be honest,matt.What
we have is temporary--

36:08.860 --> 36:11.680
a 10-month
one-night stand.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.480
What were you gonna say?

36:13.500 --> 36:15.790
I was gonna say let's get married.

36:16.390 --> 36:18.570
- Is that a joke?
- Maybe.

36:18.580 --> 36:20.830
Did you think it was funny?

36:20.850 --> 36:23.130
I never thought this was temporary,

36:23.140 --> 36:27.070
a one-night thing,even when
we had our one-night thing.

36:27.090 --> 36:30.530
You made me want more.

36:30.550 --> 36:32.680
You're still doin' it.

36:34.440 --> 36:38.800
The baby...our baby doesn't change that.

36:40.700 --> 36:42.420
And...

36:42.430 --> 36:44.100
the marriage proposal?

36:44.110 --> 36:46.740
Okay,that was probabl
a little baby-related.

36:46.750 --> 36:49.530
But,um,the rest of it,

36:51.390 --> 36:54.540
taylor,I just want to
be with you as a couple

36:54.560 --> 36:55.660
in a relationship,

36:55.670 --> 36:57.750
and all the rest of it.

36:57.900 --> 37:01.590
You know,we'll figure it out as we go.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.690
Okay.

37:15.960 --> 37:17.160
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:17.170 --> 37:19.460
Uh,I'm looking for angela scott.

37:19.470 --> 37:20.750
Angie's not on tonight.

37:20.760 --> 37:22.860
She said if you see a
guy that looks like me,

37:22.870 --> 37:23.900
that's what you say,right?

37:23.910 --> 37:25.080
No,really,she's not here.

37:25.090 --> 37:27.570
I just want to apologize to her.

37:27.580 --> 37:31.050
I was an a,and I just
stopped by to tell her that.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.600
Look,um,you seem like a nice guy,

37:34.620 --> 37:37.510
and angie can really
use a friend right now.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.670
Angie hasn't been here in weeks.

37:41.020 --> 37:44.430
She was suspended.

37:59.290 --> 38:01.350
thought you might be by.

38:02.210 --> 38:05.220
And I thought that eli
burned my dad's journal.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.200
Yeah,he did.It's ash,dude.

38:07.210 --> 38:10.490
So how did you know that I
was supposed to be in court?

38:10.760 --> 38:14.760
What,did you use some mystic
eastern power to reanimate it?

38:14.770 --> 38:17.910
Yeah. It's called...kinko'S.

38:19.360 --> 38:22.500
- I put copyway.
- Does eli know?

38:22.510 --> 38:25.880
There's stuff in there
eli's not ready to see.

38:26.130 --> 38:28.220
You can't tell him,nate.

38:35.380 --> 38:36.970
what does it say about me?

38:36.980 --> 38:38.010
- The journal?
- Yeah,

38:38.020 --> 38:40.840
look,I know that eli's
the one with the gift,

38:40.850 --> 38:44.100
the mission,but it is
affecting my life,too--

38:44.110 --> 38:45.970
my career,my job.

38:45.980 --> 38:49.570
I just--I
feel...lost.

38:49.580 --> 38:51.280
So yeah,yeah.

38:51.290 --> 38:52.650
I want to know.

38:52.660 --> 38:54.750
What happens to the
brother of the prophet?

39:16.200 --> 39:18.070
This was in thjournal.

39:21.260 --> 39:23.830
dear nathan,I'm writing to you

39:23.840 --> 39:27.460
because I don't think you'd hear
me right now if we tried to talk,

39:27.880 --> 39:32.770
and I don't have the guts to
tell you the truth about me,

39:32.780 --> 39:35.980
about what I can see...

39:35.990 --> 39:38.250
about eli...

39:38.260 --> 39:40.230
and about you.

39:40.760 --> 39:42.650
This is hard to explain,

39:42.660 --> 39:45.970
which is probably why I'm
writing instead of saying it.

39:46.440 --> 39:50.140
But you're going to watch your
brother do some amazing things,

39:50.150 --> 39:52.740
and you'll feel lost in his shadow.

39:52.750 --> 39:58.380
But know this--he won't be able to
accomplish anything without your help,

39:58.390 --> 40:00.880
your love and patience.

40:01.250 --> 40:04.440
The world is counting on you two.

40:04.460 --> 40:07.640
That's the future
you've both been handed.

40:09.920 --> 40:14.010
I got a call from st.
Vincent's in-house attorney.

40:14.020 --> 40:16.680
They want you to sign a
nondisclosure agreement.

40:18.200 --> 40:20.150
In return for your signature,

40:20.160 --> 40:22.950
they cut you a very large check.

40:29.240 --> 40:31.030
Wow.

40:31.040 --> 40:33.060
Okay,but,uh, what's the catch?

40:33.070 --> 40:35.530
You don't work there anymore.

40:37.780 --> 40:41.370
This is a little bigger than
your standard severance check.

40:44.690 --> 40:48.620
I know the hospital signed it,but...

40:50.390 --> 40:53.230
I kind of feel like it's from dad.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.590
I think that that's what
the vision was about...

40:59.890 --> 41:02.260
why you were involved
in this whole thing.

41:04.090 --> 41:09.010
Maybe it's supposed to
make up foR... everything.

41:14.930 --> 41:17.570
The check's not that big,elI.

41:22.890 --> 41:26.720
you boys are my whole world.

41:27.200 --> 41:30.020
I know what's in store for both of you.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.350
I just cry...

41:32.360 --> 41:34.730
because I'm so very proud.

41:34.740 --> 41:37.070
I love you,nathan.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.910
I love you so much it aches.

41:39.920 --> 41:41.840
Happy birthday.

41:41.850 --> 41:46.210
Love... dad.
