WEBVTT

00:07.041 --> 00:11.112
That cloud looks like a banana,
eating a banana.

00:11.212 --> 00:14.948
Whoa. Bananabalism.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.651
Uh, Flower, is that a bear?

00:17.751 --> 00:19.019
Oh, that one does
look like a bear.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.221
Good call, Ira.

00:20.321 --> 00:21.222
No. I mean

00:21.322 --> 00:23.257
right there.

00:23.357 --> 00:26.727
Hey, Mr. Bear.
How are you today?

00:26.827 --> 00:29.263
Mm. She is not long
for this world.

00:29.363 --> 00:31.031
Thor happy for bear.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.500
Eat well tonight.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.835
What's that?
Oh, you want a hug?

00:34.935 --> 00:36.804
I don't think that's
what he's saying, Flower!

00:52.686 --> 00:54.388
And she's staying.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.724
Hey.
Hi.

00:56.824 --> 00:59.059
What are
you guys looking at?

01:00.128 --> 01:02.596
Oh, man, I'd hate
to be her.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.732
Yeah.
Ugh.

01:05.566 --> 01:08.336
So, were you guys
at the music festival, or...

01:13.241 --> 01:16.344
<i>And while today
he may be celebrated</i>

01:16.444 --> 01:17.678
as a great man,

01:17.778 --> 01:19.580
it turns out Hamilton was

01:19.680 --> 01:21.349
a bit of
a nose-picker.

01:21.449 --> 01:22.416
Yeah, why don't
you tell me

01:22.516 --> 01:23.651
about the revolution?

01:23.751 --> 01:25.085
What got you
interested in that?

01:25.186 --> 01:27.555
Oh. Well,
I mean, suppose

01:27.655 --> 01:29.623
it was around the time
of the Stamp Act.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.625
You see, the Crown had
levied the most unjust tax

01:31.725 --> 01:33.461
on the colonies... Hmm.

01:33.561 --> 01:34.528
I'm sorry, what was that?

01:34.628 --> 01:36.330
Mm, nothing.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.366
Just a frog in my throat.
I see.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.068
Um, anyway, where was I?
Oh, yes.

01:41.169 --> 01:42.970
The Crown had levied
a tax on the colonies

01:43.070 --> 01:45.239
to pay for their costly
war with France--

01:45.339 --> 01:47.541
Hmm.
Okay, well, there it is again.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.244
Sorry, I should
get that.

01:50.344 --> 01:51.712
Wait-- Wait,
but what about the book?

01:51.812 --> 01:54.248
Sam, did you know
they wouldn't let Hamilton sign

01:54.348 --> 01:56.016
the Declaration of Independence?

01:56.116 --> 01:58.886
Yes! They knew where
those fingers had been!

01:58.986 --> 02:02.490
This is Paula. She's interested
in renting out our property

02:02.590 --> 02:04.057
as a shooting location.

02:04.158 --> 02:06.194
I'm with a docu-series
called <i>Dumb Deaths.</i>

02:06.294 --> 02:08.396
I don't know if you're aware,
but this property was actually

02:08.496 --> 02:09.630
the site of a dumb death.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.332
Could you be more specific?

02:11.432 --> 02:13.267
There were a number of dumb
deaths that took place here.

02:14.168 --> 02:17.471
And also just some
regular ones, too.

02:17.571 --> 02:19.207
Well, the one we're
interested in involves

02:19.307 --> 02:20.608
a hippie back in the '60s.

02:20.708 --> 02:22.643
Oh, Flower... child.

02:22.743 --> 02:25.313
A flower child is probably is
what you're talking about.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.814
The woman's name
was Susan Montero.

02:26.914 --> 02:29.783
She wandered over from
a music festival high on drugs.

02:29.883 --> 02:32.386
And then she tried
to hug a bear.

02:32.486 --> 02:34.655
So, the show would
be making fun of me?

02:34.755 --> 02:36.357
I don't love that.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.759
The shoot would be two days
and we'd give you $10,000.

02:38.859 --> 02:42.129
$10,000? That's more
than I paid for my Skylark.

02:42.230 --> 02:44.232
Uh, we could certainly
use the money.

02:44.332 --> 02:47.601
Yeah, our busy season just
ended and it wasn't that busy.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.237
So, what do you say?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.171
Well, I...

02:51.272 --> 02:52.172
Sam, I said no.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.774
I don't want to look dumb.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.977
Tell this lady and that guy
that we're not interested.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.946
Um,
Flower, look,

02:59.046 --> 03:00.814
I think you're looking
at this the wrong way.

03:00.914 --> 03:04.652
I mean, this is an opportunity
to really help Sam and Jay here.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.355
Were you going to say something?

03:07.455 --> 03:10.123
Yes. Yes, I was just

03:10.224 --> 03:11.592
thinking
about your offer.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.126
So, give me one moment.

03:13.227 --> 03:16.029
Mm. Yeah, this is all
just part of her process.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.465
She's very deliberative.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.533
As a small business owner
in life myself,

03:19.633 --> 03:21.602
I can attest to the fact
that these early days

03:21.702 --> 03:23.537
can be some
of the most stressful.

03:26.607 --> 03:29.710
You should see her try
to pick out a movie. Oof!

03:29.810 --> 03:31.979
Heck, I've arguably got
the dumbest death of them all.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.615
But I'd still be proud
to be able to lend a hand.

03:34.715 --> 03:36.684
I mean, think of all
Sam does for us.

03:36.784 --> 03:39.987
Yeah, Flower.
Do it for Sam and Jay.

03:40.854 --> 03:42.556
I guess you're right.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.493
Okay, Sam.
They can do the show about me.

03:46.327 --> 03:49.162
Okay. Having thought
about the pros and cons,

03:49.263 --> 03:51.064
I think we should do it.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.800
Great.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.668
<i>You know, Nigel,</i>

03:54.768 --> 03:56.036
earlier today,
when I was telling Sam

03:56.136 --> 03:58.372
about the injustices
building up to the war,

03:58.472 --> 04:01.542
you, um, had a reaction.

04:01.642 --> 04:04.845
A reaction?
A rather pointed, "Hmm."

04:04.945 --> 04:05.713
Did I?

04:05.813 --> 04:06.914
I'm still getting to know

04:07.014 --> 04:08.081
all your adorable little tics,

04:08.181 --> 04:11.184
but this pointed "Hmm"
seems to occur

04:11.285 --> 04:12.986
only when you're displeased.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.789
I thought it was actually
quite a reserved utterance,

04:15.889 --> 04:18.191
given the egregious
misrepresentation of history

04:18.292 --> 04:20.594
I was hearing.
Excuse me?

04:20.694 --> 04:23.664
Well, the Stamp
Act you maligned

04:23.764 --> 04:26.033
was necessary to pay
for the many troops

04:26.133 --> 04:27.901
we brought to protect
you from France

04:28.001 --> 04:29.169
during the Seven Years' War.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.305
Oh. Please.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.607
If anything, you rebels
should be thanking us.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.876
Thanking you? Thor.

04:35.976 --> 04:38.446
Thor, could you come
in here for a second?

04:38.546 --> 04:40.514
I need you to settle
something for us.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.115
Who was right
about the Stamp Act?

04:42.215 --> 04:46.354
Well, Thor feel there's no
real upside to weighing in here.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.589
Don't want to get
in middle of--

04:48.689 --> 04:50.524
Oh, come now.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.526
Was it the righteous monarchy

04:52.626 --> 04:54.795
or the sniveling colonists?

04:54.895 --> 04:57.130
What's that?

04:57.230 --> 04:59.099
Be right there!

05:05.205 --> 05:07.708
Whoa, that guy's shirt says,
<i>"It's Getting Hot In Here,</i>

05:07.808 --> 05:09.610
season one."
Yeah, the producer said

05:09.710 --> 05:10.944
it's actually
a lot of the same crew.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.781
We walk amongst the gods!

05:13.881 --> 05:16.083
So how are you
gonna shoot the bear?

05:16.183 --> 05:18.285
Is it gonna be CGI or are
you gonna get one of those guys

05:18.386 --> 05:19.387
in a bear suit?

05:19.487 --> 05:20.854
Oh, we actually pivoted

05:20.954 --> 05:22.856
from the hippie hugging
a bear idea.

05:22.956 --> 05:24.725
What?
The network felt there were

05:24.825 --> 05:26.594
too many animal episodes
this season.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.729
But we had the location,
so we looked into

05:28.829 --> 05:30.564
some of the other deaths
your wife had mentioned.

05:30.664 --> 05:31.732
Huh.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.634
It turns out some idiot

05:33.734 --> 05:35.102
got shot teaching archery

05:35.202 --> 05:37.004
to a bunch of little girls.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.240
Thank you, so nice to meet you.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.609
What's your name?

05:41.709 --> 05:44.277
Oh, my God.
They're doing you, Pete.

05:44.378 --> 05:46.880
Aw, now you get
to help Sam and Jay.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.316
You must be so happy.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.818
This is... so cool.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.220
I'm so sorry,
I don't want to be that guy.

05:53.320 --> 05:55.856
But mobile phones
weren't around in 1985.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.525
So, would you mind?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.359
Just--
I know you're not onscreen,

05:59.460 --> 06:00.928
but it's just the vibe for me.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.230
Also, could somebody
please fetch me a Tab?

06:09.002 --> 06:10.804
I actually put on
75 pounds for my last role.

06:10.904 --> 06:12.205
Took months to lose it,

06:12.305 --> 06:14.341
but no one will ever forget
Customer Number Two.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.977
You sure
you okay with this, Pete?

06:17.077 --> 06:18.746
Yeah, I was rattled at first,

06:18.846 --> 06:20.748
but I was right
in what I told Flower.

06:20.848 --> 06:23.551
I mean, this is my chance
to really help Jay and Sam.

06:23.651 --> 06:25.252
Daniel, um,
could I have a quick word?

06:25.352 --> 06:27.287
Just have a few questions
about my character.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.423
Well, it's five lines

06:29.523 --> 06:31.024
and then you get shot
with an arrow, but sure.

06:31.124 --> 06:34.094
What drives Pete Martino?

06:34.194 --> 06:36.597
Who is Pete Martino?

06:36.697 --> 06:39.399
A good-hearted man.
Kind to his family and troops.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.969
Dude, he's an idiot.
Got killed by a little girl.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.471
Okay, that's another take.

06:43.571 --> 06:45.005
Now, why would he do something

06:45.105 --> 06:47.340
so unbelievably stupid?

06:47.441 --> 06:49.209
You know,
what causes a man--

06:49.309 --> 06:51.144
an experienced
troop leader--

06:51.244 --> 06:53.581
to put himself directly
in the line of fire?

06:53.681 --> 06:55.516
I don't know.
Maybe he was drunk?

06:55.616 --> 06:56.416
What?

06:56.517 --> 06:58.519
That's crazy. Were you?

06:58.619 --> 06:59.920
No!

07:00.020 --> 07:01.154
Yes, of course he was.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.923
He looked around one day
and realized

07:03.023 --> 07:05.258
how pathetic his life was.

07:05.358 --> 07:08.562
A travel agent
booking other people's holidays

07:08.662 --> 07:10.297
while going nowhere himself.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.232
Hey, we went to Epcot, buddy.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.167
That's the whole world
all at once!

07:14.267 --> 07:16.670
And so he hit the bottle.
I can play that.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.438
Great. We good?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.541
Mm-hmm.
I'll need a flask.

07:21.475 --> 07:22.510
I'll talk to Props.

07:22.610 --> 07:24.177
Hey, do not get him a "flahsk"!

07:24.277 --> 07:26.580
We do not need a flask! Sam!

07:26.680 --> 07:29.082
Sorry, in a bit of a rush.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.785
Who is this woman who just
walked to the head of the line?

07:31.885 --> 07:33.086
That's the producer.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.588
That's the most baller job
on a film set.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.857
She could fire someone
for just looking at her.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.759
Really?
So powerful.

07:38.859 --> 07:40.393
Hey, Paula, hey, hi.

07:40.494 --> 07:42.496
The arrow guy's a drunk now.
Which flask do you want?

07:42.596 --> 07:44.765
I'd like to see
some more choices.

07:44.865 --> 07:47.234
Is that a problem, Gary?
No, ma'am.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.402
No, right away.

07:49.503 --> 07:50.838
I like her.

07:52.372 --> 07:55.375
<i>Can I bend your ears
about something?</i>

07:55.475 --> 07:58.979
I am in the most
frustrating tiff with Nigel.

07:59.079 --> 07:59.980
About what?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.381
The American Revolution.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.083
Mm, may be time
to let this one go, bud.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.484
No, no, no, I get it.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.319
It's like you guys are rooting
for different teams.

08:06.419 --> 08:07.420
I've been there.

08:07.521 --> 08:09.189
I was a huge Giants fan

08:09.289 --> 08:11.424
and I dated this chick who liked
the Eagles. Mortal enemies.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.326
S-So, what did you do?

08:13.426 --> 08:14.762
Whenever football came up,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.697
I would change the subject
to something

08:16.797 --> 08:18.599
that no one would
find controversial,

08:18.699 --> 08:21.034
like, uh, <i>The Cosby Show</i>
or Woody Allen movies.

08:21.134 --> 08:24.872
So you're saying
in order to keep the peace,

08:24.972 --> 08:27.340
I should avoid the war?

08:27.440 --> 08:29.276
Damn, Isaac, that was good.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.612
Suck on that, Hamilton.

08:31.712 --> 08:33.446
What's going on?
Pete's upset with the way

08:33.547 --> 08:35.015
the show is trying
to portray him.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.684
It's a gosh darn hatchet job!

08:36.784 --> 08:39.152
Sorry about the locker room
talk, but I am steamed.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.955
They're implying that he was
drunk the day of the incident.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.357
Look, I may not have had
the perfect marriage.

08:44.457 --> 08:46.126
And at work,
I was a good travel agent,

08:46.226 --> 08:47.527
but I was no Greg Flannagan.

08:47.628 --> 08:49.630
Famous travel agent?

08:49.730 --> 08:51.765
There are no famous
travel agents.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.101
The point is, the one thing
I could hang my hat on

08:54.201 --> 08:56.103
was that I was
a great Scout troop leader.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.606
Those kids loved me,
and I was there for them.

08:58.706 --> 09:00.641
That's what makes
this so hurtful.

09:01.575 --> 09:03.476
Hey, uh, Paula,
could I just have a second?

09:03.577 --> 09:05.445
I'm a little concerned
about this whole,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.314
"Portraying Pete
as a drunk" thing.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.583
Um, yeah, we don't typically
take creative notes

09:09.683 --> 09:11.218
from the owners
of the location.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.953
Now, is that all?
Because Paula and I have

09:13.053 --> 09:14.822
a million things to do if
we're gonna make our day.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.224
Right, it's just,
I actually know his widow.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.359
I met his grandkid.

09:19.459 --> 09:20.594
Oh, God,
Little Pete's gonna see this.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.295
This is how he's gonna know me.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.463
And I don't think
they would appreciate

09:23.563 --> 09:24.898
an inaccurate depiction.

09:24.998 --> 09:26.800
How do you know it's inaccurate?
Were you there?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.468
Yes!
No.

09:28.568 --> 09:30.170
Okay, well,
if we need you

09:30.270 --> 09:31.404
to move your cars or anything,

09:31.504 --> 09:32.873
we'll let you know.

09:32.973 --> 09:35.008
Producers coming through,
clear the way.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.478
This is so unfair.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.013
They can't do this
to my guy Pete.

09:40.113 --> 09:41.348
What are we supposed to do, Jay?

09:41.448 --> 09:42.983
They're right, we weren't there.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.986
But we were.

09:47.020 --> 09:48.555
Right, that's also not helpful.

09:48.656 --> 09:51.358
What about one
of his old troopers?

09:51.458 --> 09:52.693
That's it.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.027
We could track one of them down

09:54.127 --> 09:55.328
and they could set
the record straight.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.697
That's a great idea!

09:56.797 --> 09:58.431
I'll look them up,
and assuming they're not

09:58.531 --> 09:59.967
too traumatized
to talk about it,

10:00.067 --> 10:00.968
we'll make it happen.

10:01.068 --> 10:02.502
It was very traumatizing.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.905
Thor not sleep for many
moons after witnessing.

10:05.005 --> 10:08.308
And I've chopped heads off,
and drank blood from open necks.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.278
Now, let's track down
a middle-aged woman.

10:14.381 --> 10:18.986
Isaac, I hope you're not
too upset to go on our stroll.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.220
Just the opposite.

10:20.320 --> 10:21.855
And I was thinking

10:21.955 --> 10:24.491
we should avoid talk
of the revolution altogether.

10:24.591 --> 10:26.293
Ah. Splendid idea.

10:26.393 --> 10:28.996
Ooh, I wonder
if we'll see ducks!

10:29.096 --> 10:30.397
You know, I was thinking,

10:30.497 --> 10:31.999
we always go for a walk
by the lake.

10:32.099 --> 10:34.601
Why not mix it up and go
for a walk in the woods instead?

10:34.702 --> 10:36.403
That would be
most enjoyable.

10:36.503 --> 10:38.672
But it is tradition
that we stroll by the lake.

10:38.772 --> 10:40.207
It's how
we've always strolled.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.609
Yes, but sometimes tradition
is meant to be broken,

10:42.710 --> 10:43.877
especially when one party

10:43.977 --> 10:45.679
desires to go
in a new direction.

10:45.779 --> 10:48.415
Well, why go in a new direction
when the old direction

10:48.515 --> 10:49.950
is working just fine?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.985
I deserve a vote
in where we walk.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.354
No ambulation
without representation.

10:54.454 --> 10:55.923
Wait a minute.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.191
You're not talking
about the walk!

10:58.291 --> 10:59.793
Oh, nothing gets by you,
does it?

10:59.893 --> 11:02.029
Except the most prosperous
colony in all the empire.

11:02.129 --> 11:05.699
Oh! This is precisely
the kind of childish behavior

11:05.799 --> 11:07.534
one would expect from a...

11:07.634 --> 11:09.002
A what?

11:09.102 --> 11:10.871
Say it. I dare you.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.605
Yankee.

11:12.706 --> 11:14.207
You did not.

11:14.307 --> 11:17.010
Yankee, Yankee, Yankee, Yankee!

11:17.110 --> 11:18.611
I don't get this rewrite.

11:18.712 --> 11:19.947
Why would I say "Howdy?"

11:20.047 --> 11:22.215
Is this a Western?
Am I Jonathan Wayne?

11:22.315 --> 11:23.316
Just say the words.

11:23.416 --> 11:24.517
Picture's up in ten

11:24.617 --> 11:25.719
and we're running
out of daylight.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.855
Thank you so much
for coming.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.857
It would mean a lot to Pete's
family that you're here.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.859
I mean, it was a pretty
crazy call to get,

11:31.959 --> 11:33.894
but if I can do something to
help out Mr. Martino, I'm game.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.529
Aw, she's a good kid.
Oh, Sam, offer her a ring-pop.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.131
Cherry's her favorite flavor.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.401
Paula, I would like to introduce
you to Jennifer Macklin.

11:41.501 --> 11:43.136
She's actually one
of the little girls

11:43.236 --> 11:45.305
from Pete's Pinecone troop.
Pete?

11:45.405 --> 11:47.274
The guy who died?

11:47.374 --> 11:48.675
Oh, right,
this week's idiot.

11:48.776 --> 11:50.043
She has a lot
on her plate.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.845
You were there?

11:51.945 --> 11:53.180
Tell me everything, Jennifer.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.984
Bring me inside the
mind... of a madman.

11:57.084 --> 11:59.486
Well, for one, Mr. Martino
would never have a flask.

11:59.586 --> 12:00.587
He wasn't a drinker.

12:00.687 --> 12:02.189
Ha, see? I told you.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.858
But he was a bitter soul,

12:04.958 --> 12:06.860
visibly haunted
by demons from his past?

12:06.960 --> 12:08.762
No. I'm sorry.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.598
That's about the exact opposite
of Mr. Martino.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.134
Damn it!
Whatever tenuous foothold I had

12:14.234 --> 12:15.602
into this man is gone.

12:15.702 --> 12:17.137
I've completely
lost my character.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.206
Right, back to basics.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.640
I'm a bumbling cuckold

12:20.740 --> 12:22.742
whose only friends
are little children.

12:22.843 --> 12:24.344
So, you see,
Pete did nothing wrong.

12:24.444 --> 12:25.879
It was an unfortunate incident

12:25.979 --> 12:28.148
and nothing "dumb"
on Pete's part.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.183
Yeah, sorry, Paula, if that's
not good for your show,

12:30.283 --> 12:32.052
but, I mean, you heard
it from an eyewitness.

12:32.152 --> 12:34.154
Well, he did do something
sort of dumb.

12:34.254 --> 12:35.622
Wait, what?

12:35.722 --> 12:37.424
Was it pills? Pills I can play.
Was it pills?

12:37.524 --> 12:39.759
For some reason, on that day,
I remember him handing out

12:39.860 --> 12:42.395
the bows and arrows
before the safety demonstration.

12:42.495 --> 12:43.831
What? That's not true.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.799
40 years seems like
an awfully long time

12:45.899 --> 12:47.234
for such a small detail.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.601
No, this
I'm sure about.

12:48.701 --> 12:50.070
He just seemed
really distracted.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.239
He kept muttering
something about donut holes.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.740
Oh, my God...

12:53.841 --> 12:57.945
Yeah. You were muttering
about donut holes.

12:58.045 --> 12:59.412
She's right.

12:59.512 --> 13:00.814
It all started that morning

13:00.914 --> 13:02.883
before I headed
to the archery lesson.

13:07.587 --> 13:10.090
Is, uh-- Sweetie, did-did you
eat the rest of the donut holes?

13:10.190 --> 13:11.825
Yeah, I thought
you were done with them.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.593
No, Carol, I was looking forward

13:13.693 --> 13:15.528
to having some before I left.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.297
You don't even like donut holes.

13:17.397 --> 13:19.366
No, I like donut holes.
I don't like donuts.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.068
Okay, that doesn't
make any sense.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.236
The donut holes are
punched out of the donut.
That's wrong.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.972
You see, donut holes come
from their own machine.

13:25.072 --> 13:27.540
Okay, even if that were true,

13:27.640 --> 13:29.910
they're all donut material!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.679
I was so distracted,
I must have handed out

13:32.779 --> 13:34.347
the arrows before doing
the safety speech.

13:34.447 --> 13:38.651
Okay, so he wasn't a reckless
drunk, he was just an idiot?

13:38.751 --> 13:40.053
Are we done here?

13:43.490 --> 13:44.491
Don't listen to her, Pete.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.859
Why not? She's right.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.727
I failed those girls.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.998
I was a terrible
Pinecone troop leader.

13:52.699 --> 13:55.002
A sugar fiend
in need of his fix.

13:55.102 --> 13:59.239
His blind pursuit of pastries
ultimately costing him his life,

13:59.339 --> 14:01.641
and earning me a general meeting
with JJ Abrams,

14:01.741 --> 14:03.110
or someone at his company.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.683
So, how's Pete doing?
He looks pretty glum.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.153
He tried to rip off his
Pinecone Trooper badge,

14:13.253 --> 14:14.821
but it just zapped
right back into place.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.623
Thanks for
highlighting my impotence.

14:16.723 --> 14:18.926
What's going on?
Pete's impotent.

14:19.026 --> 14:22.362
Oh, is that why he didn't
want to be our third?

14:22.462 --> 14:25.598
It's okay. There's
still stuff you can do.

14:25.698 --> 14:26.666
Paula.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.501
I'm sorry,
but we're going to have

14:28.601 --> 14:30.003
to shut
this whole thing down.

14:30.103 --> 14:31.004
Oh, my God.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.372
Just forget it, Sam.

14:32.472 --> 14:34.774
I died dumb.
It's time to pay the piper.

14:34.874 --> 14:37.377
I get that it's accurate now,
but as friends of Pete's family,

14:37.477 --> 14:39.212
we just don't
feel comfortable...

14:39.312 --> 14:40.647
Here's the thing.
You signed a contract

14:40.747 --> 14:42.382
stipulating we can shoot here,

14:42.482 --> 14:45.185
so we're shooting here.
Okay, sweetie?

14:46.153 --> 14:48.455
And that is why you are you,

14:48.555 --> 14:52.359
and she produced
<i>World's Hottest Dentists.</i>

14:55.728 --> 14:57.197
Isaac...

14:57.297 --> 14:58.999
what's going on?

14:59.099 --> 15:02.435
It's just this thing
that I have with Nigel.

15:02.535 --> 15:04.037
It's not going to last.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.472
What happened?

15:06.906 --> 15:10.377
It's just that our differences
are simply irreconcilable.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.880
Americans and the British
are sworn enemies

15:13.981 --> 15:16.249
and it shall remain that way
until the end of time.

15:16.349 --> 15:18.618
Isaac.
Hmm?

15:18.718 --> 15:21.821
Britain and the U.S.
are basically best friends.

15:23.290 --> 15:24.791
What? Really?

15:24.891 --> 15:26.726
They are, like,
our closest ally.

15:26.826 --> 15:29.096
You know, there's even
a name for the friendship

15:29.196 --> 15:30.830
between Britain and America.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.166
It's called,
"The Special Relationship."

15:33.266 --> 15:34.767
Honestly, Samantha,

15:34.867 --> 15:37.404
I'm impressed with
your knowledge of geopolitics.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.306
Thank you. I...
I learned it from a movie

15:39.406 --> 15:40.807
called <i>Love Actually.</i>

15:40.907 --> 15:42.375
There we go.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.211
All right, last looks,
everybody!

15:44.311 --> 15:46.746
Oh, Daniel,
an idea, if I may.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.816
When the arrow's punctured
my neck and shattered

15:49.916 --> 15:51.084
Pete Martino's dreams...

15:51.184 --> 15:53.120
I urinate.

15:53.220 --> 15:54.487
Sure, why not?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.456
You know, that's real.
That's what the body does.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.691
I like it.
Yeah, that's not bad.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.194
Wardrobe!
We're gonna need more shorts.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.729
This is going great.

16:02.829 --> 16:03.863
Poor Pete.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.498
We have to do
something to stop this.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.867
Sam already tried,
but it didn't work.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.371
Well...

16:11.471 --> 16:15.675
then we do something.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.979
Are you gonna make
a suggestion, or...

16:20.747 --> 16:23.883
Oh. No, Thor just trying
to get the ball rolling.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.786
You know?
While I have poured

16:26.886 --> 16:29.289
my heart and soul
into this production,

16:29.389 --> 16:31.491
my allegiance is with Peter.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.393
And I know how we can
shut this thing down.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.062
Thor, we'll need
your ghost power.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.963
We're going to focus
your destructive capacity

16:37.064 --> 16:38.998
on the most important part
of any production.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.300
The writer?

16:41.868 --> 16:44.771
Oh, sorry, I thought you were
purposely making a joke.

16:44.871 --> 16:48.075
No. I am talking about...
the camera.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.110
All right, picture's up!

16:56.683 --> 16:59.586
Okay, I've got three takes
in me. Let's make them count.

16:59.686 --> 17:01.354
All right, the stunt
of him getting shot

17:01.454 --> 17:02.789
in the neck is up next,
so just make sure

17:02.889 --> 17:04.657
the bow and arrow's ready. Copy.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.626
I know I'm not technically
with production,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.196
but hey, I am the owner
of the house,

17:09.296 --> 17:11.464
so gimme a tuna sandwich, huh?

17:11.564 --> 17:13.233
No one has to know.
All right.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.703
So, you've given the little
girls the bow and arrows.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.671
You should have given them
the safety precautions,

17:18.771 --> 17:21.974
but you were too distracted
by your donut hole rant.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.277
Okay, just say, "Action,"
I can't hold it in much longer.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.214
And... action!

17:27.314 --> 17:29.882
Girls, listen up,
pay attention.

17:29.982 --> 17:30.950
Thor, camera!

17:31.050 --> 17:33.286
Prepare to be destroyed,
tiny foe!

17:34.554 --> 17:36.323
I'd like to talk to you through

17:36.423 --> 17:37.957
some important
safety procedures.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.792
This is all information that
would've been really useful

17:39.892 --> 17:42.929
before you handed out
the deadly weapons, you idiot!

17:44.831 --> 17:47.267
Oh, just lost a battery.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.001
You did it, Thor!

17:49.102 --> 17:52.004
Because I told him so.
Producing!

17:52.105 --> 17:53.072
Okay, good to go.

17:53.173 --> 17:54.174
What?

17:54.274 --> 17:55.875
All right, action!
What?

17:55.975 --> 17:57.677
Listen up, girls,
pay attention.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.312
You got another one
in you, big guy?

17:59.412 --> 18:00.813
You can do it.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.782
Come on, Thor.
Come on, Thor.

18:02.882 --> 18:05.017
Ow! Oh.
Ooh.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.753
Whoa,
what was in that tuna wrap?

18:06.853 --> 18:08.155
Oh, he's quite stoned.

18:08.255 --> 18:11.057
Hey. You want to go
for a ride, little buddy?

18:12.259 --> 18:14.026
Oh.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.195
Ow!

18:15.295 --> 18:16.529
Jay!

18:17.764 --> 18:19.599
Is there an arrow in my butt?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.935
Do not remove the arrow.
Stay calm.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.671
Help.
Is anyone going
to do anything?

18:24.771 --> 18:27.073
Do not remove the arrow.
Stay calm. Okay.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.475
Bandages. Tape.

18:28.575 --> 18:30.009
Uh, we need to support the arrow
and secure it.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.678
Then we're gonna make
a tourniquet.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.280
Bandages. Tape.
We need to support the arrow,

18:33.380 --> 18:35.948
secure it, and then we're
going to make a tourniquet.

18:36.048 --> 18:39.186
Wait, so
Jennifer can hear ghosts?

18:40.387 --> 18:43.190
No. She just... remembers.

18:44.591 --> 18:47.527
Because you were
a good troop leader.

18:48.328 --> 18:49.529
I guess I was.

18:54.066 --> 18:55.235
Oh, that's a waste.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.437
And he wet himself.

18:57.537 --> 19:00.440
Wardrobe.
We're gonna need new shorts.

19:00.540 --> 19:01.908
And socks!

19:02.008 --> 19:03.510
Also socks.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.017
Everybody dies.

19:11.117 --> 19:13.119
But not everybody dies... dumbly.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.988
<i>This is</i> Dumb Deaths.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.691
Oh, is this the program
they did about Peter?

19:18.791 --> 19:21.528
No, uh, after Jay got
shot with an arrow,

19:21.628 --> 19:22.995
we agreed not to sue
in return for them

19:23.095 --> 19:24.564
not doing Pete's story.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.333
Thank you, Sam.
But we still wanted

19:26.433 --> 19:28.067
Sam and Jay to
get paid, so...

19:28.167 --> 19:30.102
This week's dummy is a hippie

19:30.203 --> 19:32.639
who tried to hug a bear.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.942
Hey, glad you
and Nigel made up.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.310
Yes. If America and England

19:37.410 --> 19:39.246
can resolve their issues,
so can we.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.381
They are very
similar countries.

19:41.481 --> 19:43.816
So one has
a parliamentary system

19:43.916 --> 19:46.453
that's slightly superior.
No matter.

19:47.420 --> 19:48.455
Hmm.

19:48.555 --> 19:50.122
What was that,
my special friend?

19:50.223 --> 19:52.024
Hmm? Oh, nothing,
my special friend.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.160
Sam, you're on the TV.

19:55.328 --> 19:57.664
Yo, man, is that a bear?

19:58.498 --> 20:00.733
I bet it totally
wants to hug me.

20:01.901 --> 20:03.403
Uh...
Hey, Fluffy.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.373
Ooh! Oh, my God,
this is so embarrassing.

20:06.473 --> 20:09.075
Then why did you insist they
cast you as part of the deal?

20:09.175 --> 20:10.677
Who else was gonna
step in last second?

20:10.777 --> 20:12.912
And besides, I was in
drama club in high school.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.447
I thought
you just built sets.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.549
Because of politics, Jay!
No!

20:16.649 --> 20:20.387
This was supposed to be a hip
and groovy day, you dig?

20:20.487 --> 20:24.524
But this is like...
the opposite of groovy!

20:24.624 --> 20:26.859
Didn't the real Ira
run off screaming?

20:26.959 --> 20:27.960
He didn't think
that was something

20:28.060 --> 20:28.995
his character would do.

20:29.095 --> 20:30.530
There's no such thing

20:30.630 --> 20:32.031
as free love.

20:32.131 --> 20:35.234
There's always a price.

20:38.338 --> 20:41.140
Is he... soiling himself?

20:42.709 --> 20:44.210
Yep.
