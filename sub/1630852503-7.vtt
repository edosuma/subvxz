07:56.742 --> 07:58.945
{\an9}I just started thinking
about my office.

07:59.011 --> 08:02.114
{\an9}Maybe the desk
should go here, huh?

08:02.181 --> 08:03.950
Wait. Your office?

08:04.016 --> 08:06.519
Yeah, well, it's not official
till the vote, obviously,

08:06.586 --> 08:09.255
but, uh, now that I'm running
unopposed, it's not exactly

08:09.322 --> 08:10.957
a nail biter.

08:11.023 --> 08:12.792
What-what do you mean,
you're running unopposed?

08:12.859 --> 08:14.060
What happened to Sam?

08:14.126 --> 08:16.996
Well, she wants me back
in charge.

08:17.063 --> 08:20.533
Back in surgery,
back to normal.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.101
S-So she dropped out?

08:22.168 --> 08:23.703
Did she say why?

08:23.769 --> 08:25.104
I think that ultimately,
she realized

08:25.171 --> 08:27.006
I'm the leader
this department needed,

08:27.073 --> 08:28.875
that my world-class

08:28.941 --> 08:31.077
{\an5}reputation...

08:28.941 --> 08:31.077
(discordant notes play)

08:38.317 --> 08:40.253
{\an1}Well, I'm not saying
it was easy,

08:40.318 --> 08:42.255
you two fighting all the time,

08:42.321 --> 08:44.724
{\an1}but is dropping out
the solution?

08:44.790 --> 08:46.726
{\an3}Yes. And ever since
this whole battle started,

08:46.792 --> 08:48.027
I haven't been myself.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.563
I haven't been there
for you as a friend.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.632
{\an5}Sure you have.

08:50.630 --> 08:52.632
What about your lawsuit?

08:52.698 --> 08:56.035
{\an5}The lawsuit settled.

08:52.698 --> 08:56.035
And I wasn't there for you.

08:56.102 --> 08:58.838
{\an3}Caleb sat up with me
all night, just listening,

08:58.905 --> 09:01.307
and it made all
the difference.

09:01.374 --> 09:04.076
It made all the difference?

09:04.143 --> 09:05.311
Labs on your track star.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.113
Thanks, Bernie.

09:09.949 --> 09:12.084
Your dad was right
about the cadmium.

09:12.151 --> 09:15.054
The heavy metals, we can flush,
but look at her troponin levels.

09:15.121 --> 09:19.025
{\an1}BNP's elevated, too. Her cardiac
enzymes are through the roof.

09:19.091 --> 09:21.160
{\an3}How does a teenage track star
have the biomarkers

09:21.227 --> 09:23.996
{\an3}of an 85-year-old
in advanced heart failure?

09:27.733 --> 09:29.201
(elevator bell dings)

09:31.337 --> 09:33.272
{\an3}Hey, there. You look
a little lost.

09:33.339 --> 09:34.740
{\an3}Yeah, I'm looking
for my son.

09:34.807 --> 09:36.242
{\an3}Apparently, he's in
cardiothoracics.

09:36.309 --> 09:37.777
{\an1}Oh, well,
that's where I'm headed.

09:37.843 --> 09:39.312
Thank you, Doctor.

09:39.378 --> 09:40.980
Sure. Oh, if you want,

09:41.047 --> 09:43.816
I can look him up for you,
tell you what room he's in.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.852
Oh, no, no. My son's not
a patient. He works here.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.993
Hi.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.895
{\an1}Hey.

09:55.962 --> 09:58.965
{\an3}I didn't expect to see
you here, not that

09:59.031 --> 10:01.167
{\an3}you're here to see me. I
shouldn't make that assumption.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.837
{\an5}Not everything is about me.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.837
I saw your dad earlier.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.105
He-he was in your office.

10:06.172 --> 10:09.608
Oh. Well, was he measuring
for drapes?

10:09.675 --> 10:11.677
So it is true.

10:11.744 --> 10:14.113
{\an1}You dropped out
of the race.

10:14.180 --> 10:16.248
Mm-hmm.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.786
Hurting you was a wake-up call
for me, Malcolm.

10:20.853 --> 10:22.788
And I know
that I can't undo the past,

10:22.855 --> 10:25.191
but I am not going to repeat it.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.962
For what it's worth,
I think you would've beat him.

10:30.029 --> 10:32.031
{\an5}(elevator bell dings)

10:30.029 --> 10:32.031
With or without my mom.

10:32.098 --> 10:33.032
To be honest,

10:33.099 --> 10:34.000
I'm just hoping

10:34.066 --> 10:36.369
we can put the stuff
with your mom behind us.

10:36.435 --> 10:38.771
{\an3}Oh, it's definitely
behind you.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.709
Hello, Malcolm.

10:45.478 --> 10:47.413
What are you doing here, Mom?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.815
Mom?

11:00.126 --> 11:01.060
TINA:
Malcolm, please talk to me.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.294
You shouldn't have come.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.163
{\an3}It wasn't my idea.
Dr. Griffith called.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.898
Yes, and I am very sorry

11:05.965 --> 11:08.100
{\an3}that you came all this way,
Mrs. Kingsley.

11:08.167 --> 11:10.803
{\an1}But everything
has been resolved.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.805
{\an1}My father will
take over again soon.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.306
Your father can't even
perform surgery.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.075
{\an3}MALCOLM:
Why do you care?

11:16.142 --> 11:18.778
{\an5}This isn't your concern.

11:16.142 --> 11:18.778
Of course it is.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.247
I mean, I don't do
the day-to-day.

11:21.313 --> 11:23.249
That's supposed
to be your father's job.

11:23.315 --> 11:25.251
But I do run this foundation.

11:25.317 --> 11:26.919
And should this hospital fall
into disarray,

11:26.986 --> 11:29.455
{\an3}well, that would make
my job much harder.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.424
{\an1}Everything is
under control here.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.959
{\an3}If that were true, you
never would have called me.

11:34.026 --> 11:37.997
Dr. Griffith, you know,
bad leadership leads to chaos.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.332
{\an3}And chaos is bad for
business-- yours and mine.

11:40.399 --> 11:42.868
Order must be restored.

11:46.238 --> 11:48.441
(sighs)

11:48.507 --> 11:50.443
You look like
you're feeling better, April.

11:50.509 --> 11:52.745
{\an3}I am. Super glad
I'm not dead.

11:52.812 --> 11:54.847
{\an1}Why were you diving down there
in the first place?

11:54.914 --> 11:57.383
Are you kidding? The Great Lakes
are full of shipwrecks.

11:57.450 --> 11:58.717
There's so much to explore.

11:58.784 --> 12:00.152
{\an1}Why not explore
in the summer

12:00.219 --> 12:02.054
when the risk
of hypothermic death

12:02.121 --> 12:03.422
is just a little bit lower?

12:03.489 --> 12:04.924
The risk is why I do it.

12:04.990 --> 12:06.358
The bigger the risk,
the bigger the rush.

12:06.425 --> 12:07.993
Hmm. Adrenaline junkie.

12:08.060 --> 12:09.962
You're like my fiancée.

12:10.029 --> 12:11.497
What happened, exactly?

12:11.564 --> 12:14.133
{\an3}I was inside one
of the wrecks.

12:14.200 --> 12:16.001
So awesome. And...

12:16.068 --> 12:19.271
But then my hand cramped,
and I dropped my flashlight,

12:19.338 --> 12:21.040
snagged my suit
going after it.

12:21.107 --> 12:22.308
Wait. Y-Your hand
cramped so badly

12:22.374 --> 12:23.776
{\an1}that you couldn't hold on
to your flashlight?

12:23.843 --> 12:26.112
Has that ever happened before?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.280
Yeah. All the time, actually.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.282
That can be a, uh, sign

12:30.349 --> 12:33.018
{\an1}of a neurological condition
called "focal dystonia."

12:33.085 --> 12:34.353
Neurological?

12:34.420 --> 12:36.288
Is there something wrong
with my brain?

12:36.355 --> 12:39.325
{\an1}It's more like, um,
the way that your brain

12:39.391 --> 12:41.760
{\an1}and your muscles talk
to each other.

12:42.595 --> 12:45.498
We'll know more after the test.

12:45.564 --> 12:49.201
Violet Stein. That is one of the
ugliest valves I've ever seen.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.804
Mitral deterioration is
very advanced.

12:51.871 --> 12:54.039
There's no family history
of heart disease?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.508
{\an3}No.

12:55.574 --> 12:58.110
{\an1}She's a typical teenager
with no preexisting conditions.

12:58.177 --> 13:00.179
What about the cadmium toxicity?

13:00.246 --> 13:02.548
{\an4}Well, explains the bones,
but not the heart.

13:00.246 --> 13:02.548
And she's had

13:02.615 --> 13:04.283
no symptoms of valve disease?

13:04.350 --> 13:07.486
No. None. We only caught it
because she fell.

13:07.553 --> 13:10.222
Although, the falling
could be a symptom.

13:10.289 --> 13:12.191
Cardiovascular syncope.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.559
Blood flow to her brain is
getting cut off during exertion.

13:13.626 --> 13:15.227
Like during a track event.

13:15.294 --> 13:18.297
She's broken multiple ribs.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.166
Because she's fallen
during multiple races.

13:20.232 --> 13:23.068
She's gonna keep falling
unless we replace this valve.

13:23.135 --> 13:26.205
We can do it today...
after Dr. Griffith's

13:26.272 --> 13:28.107
{\an3}bypass.

13:28.174 --> 13:29.942
{\an3}Back-to-back
surgeries.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.277
{\an6}I love it.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.277
{\an1}Yeah?

13:31.343 --> 13:32.811
{\an1}Then why are you still
standing here?

13:32.878 --> 13:35.147
Get to the OR,
man your stations.

13:35.214 --> 13:37.283
Let's go, people.

13:49.094 --> 13:50.429
Byron.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.831
You know, after

13:52.898 --> 13:56.869
{\an3}all these years, I still
don't like this tie.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.905
What are you doing here, Tina?

13:59.972 --> 14:02.508
I was called, and
now that I'm here,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.076
I have no intention

14:04.143 --> 14:06.045
of rubber-stamping
the reinstatement

14:06.111 --> 14:07.980
of Rob Griffith as chief.

14:08.047 --> 14:10.849
{\an3}I had reservations about
him the first time around.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.886
{\an1}You said you'd stay out
of hospital business.

14:13.953 --> 14:15.888
{\an1}And you said you'd stay
out of our son's business.

14:15.955 --> 14:17.990
{\an1}Yet, I see he's running around
like your little clone.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.326
{\an5}It was his decision
to come here.

14:18.057 --> 14:20.326
It's not good

14:20.392 --> 14:21.994
for him to live
in your shadow like this.

14:22.061 --> 14:24.096
Don't talk to me
about what's good for him.

14:24.163 --> 14:26.932
You're the one who turned
your back on this family.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.634
Which makes you, what?
The blameless victim?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.269
Is that how you remember it?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.137
It's how it went down.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.073
{\an1}Clearly,
what our son thinks, too.

14:34.139 --> 14:36.008
You turned him against me.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.077
No.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.279
No, Tina.

14:40.346 --> 14:42.448
You did that all by yourself.

14:42.514 --> 14:46.619
{\an1}Well, here's hoping
I can undo it.

14:46.685 --> 14:49.154
{\an1}See you at the next
board meeting.

14:56.328 --> 14:59.398
{\an5}(steady beeping)

14:56.328 --> 14:59.398
A mechanical valve?

14:59.465 --> 15:01.066
{\an3}Yes.

15:01.133 --> 15:03.636
They're strong, reliable.

15:03.702 --> 15:05.571
It should last you
the rest of your life.

15:05.638 --> 15:07.906
{\an1}How can she have
heart disease?

15:07.973 --> 15:09.275
We're vegans.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.577
Our diets are
very healthy.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.282
Your diet may not have caused
your valve disease,

15:16.348 --> 15:20.052
{\an3}but all of that soy
and cadmium did contribute

15:20.119 --> 15:21.120
to your broken ribs.

15:21.186 --> 15:25.557
{\an3}Now, a new valve will help
your heart get stronger,

15:25.624 --> 15:28.027
{\an3}but you'll likely need
to make some dietary changes

15:28.093 --> 15:30.429
to help your bones
get stronger, too.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.398
What kind of changes?

15:33.032 --> 15:36.135
Have you ever considered
eating any fish or meat?

15:36.201 --> 15:37.636
{\an4}No.

15:36.201 --> 15:37.636
No.

15:37.703 --> 15:40.472
{\an1}Violet has never had so much
as a glass of milk in her life.

15:40.539 --> 15:42.207
We are diligent
about supplements,

15:42.274 --> 15:45.377
{\an3}and getting all the nutrients we
need from non-animal sources.

15:45.444 --> 15:46.645
If we need to cut back on soy,
we will,

15:46.712 --> 15:48.647
but meat is not an option.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.687
{\an3}Why don't we get you
started with a new valve,

15:54.753 --> 15:57.156
{\an3}and we'll take
the rest from there?

16:02.428 --> 16:04.430
Your EMG results are in.

16:04.496 --> 16:06.999
Your motor unit recruitment
is perfect.

16:07.066 --> 16:09.401
{\an5}What does that mean?

16:07.066 --> 16:09.401
{\an3}It means whatever's
causing the cramp

16:09.468 --> 16:10.703
{\an1}is probably
not neurological.

16:10.769 --> 16:14.239
Oh.
Well, does that mean I can go?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.075
We still haven't found
the cause of the cramp.

16:16.141 --> 16:17.743
Hey, as long
as my brain's okay,

16:17.810 --> 16:20.079
I can live
with a few dropped flashlights

16:20.145 --> 16:21.513
and the occasional
charley horse.

16:21.580 --> 16:23.048
Charley horse.

16:23.115 --> 16:24.483
{\an1}Peripheral artery disease
would explain the hand

16:24.550 --> 16:26.485
{\an1}and the claudication
in the lower extremities.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.454
She needs a stress test.

16:28.520 --> 16:31.056
{\an1}You can't go
just yet, April.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.361
{\an1}So...

16:35.427 --> 16:38.530
Malcolm's mom is here.

16:38.597 --> 16:40.666
(sighs)
Yes.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.674
But you shouldn't feel guilty
or anything. It's not like

16:48.741 --> 16:51.243
you told her to come.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.446
{\an5}And...

16:51.310 --> 16:54.446
{\an3}Hmm. I need to get
my head in the game.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.616
{\an3}I blew it.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.251
{\an1}You didn't blow it.
It was one "I love you."

16:59.318 --> 17:01.754
{\an3}No. She's never gonna
talk to me again.

17:01.820 --> 17:05.523
She said talking to you
made all the difference.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.526
She said that?

17:07.593 --> 17:09.361
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

17:09.428 --> 17:11.195
All right, gentlemen,

17:11.262 --> 17:14.433

20:17.482 --> 20:19.217
What is all this?

20:19.284 --> 20:21.453
{\an3}We think there's a
blockage in your arteries

20:21.520 --> 20:23.622
{\an3}restricting blood flow
to your extremities.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.990
{\an3}This is gonna
help us find it.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.892
{\an5}I just start running?

20:25.057 --> 20:26.892
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

20:26.959 --> 20:29.361
{\an3}This IV has a
radioactive tracer in it.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.363
So we're gonna get
your heart pumping

{\an3}and let the tracer
lead us to the problem.

20:32.965 --> 20:34.633
Take her to four.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.401
How fast does it go?

20:36.468 --> 20:38.737
{\an3}Most people get up

20:38.804 --> 20:41.640
{\an5}Take me to seven.

{\an3}All right, her hand's cramping.
Are you okay, April?

20:50.315 --> 20:51.617
{\an5}It hurts.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.617
{\an3}What hurts?

20:51.683 --> 20:53.385
{\an5}Everything.

20:51.683 --> 20:53.385

No! Take me higher.

Please, you have to.
Going faster is

20:56.421 --> 20:58.290

Make what stop?

20:58.357 --> 21:00.392
{\an5}The pain!

20:58.357 --> 21:00.392
{\an1}All right, all right.
I'm pulling it.

21:00.459 --> 21:02.394

(groans)

21:07.766 --> 21:10.469
{\an3}Mind telling me what
happened in that bypass?

21:10.535 --> 21:11.837
What are you talking about?

21:11.903 --> 21:13.005
{\an3}Your father dropped
an instrument

21:13.071 --> 21:14.740
{\an3}in the middle
of surgery.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.041
The surgery was over,

21:16.108 --> 21:17.709
{\an1}and surgeons drop instruments
all the time.

21:17.776 --> 21:19.811
{\an3}When was the last time
he dropped one?

21:19.878 --> 21:21.413
I'm due in another surgery soon.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.548
{\an3}He was in a coma for
six months. Now he can't

21:23.615 --> 21:25.350
{\an3}get through a routine surgery
without incident.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.486
{\an5}There was no incident.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.486
I know what I saw.

21:27.552 --> 21:29.655
{\an1}With all due respect,
I am Dr. Griffith's proctor.

21:29.721 --> 21:30.922
I am the only person

21:30.989 --> 21:32.824
who is authorized
to assess his progress,

21:32.891 --> 21:35.060
and I am telling you
that there is no issue

21:35.127 --> 21:37.596
or concern
regarding his performance.

21:38.263 --> 21:42.000
Well, I guess
that's all there is to say.

21:47.939 --> 21:50.575
{\an3}Stress test shows
her arteries are clear.

21:50.642 --> 21:52.711
{\an3}We know her nerve and
muscle function are normal.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.413
So, what's with the hand cramp?

21:54.479 --> 21:57.015
{\an3}It only happens during
extreme activity. My guess:

21:57.082 --> 21:59.084
involuntary response
to stress hormones.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.952
{\an1}So, she stops
the extreme sports

22:01.019 --> 22:02.454
and the hand cramp goes away.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.456
{\an5}But she's not gonna stop.

22:02.521 --> 22:04.456
{\an1}Why not?

22:04.523 --> 22:06.725
{\an3}I see it with Tim, too.
He'll do anything for a rush.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.326
Except with April, it's even

22:08.393 --> 22:10.028
more intense. What
if the hand cramp

22:10.095 --> 22:11.963
is actually a small price to pay
for the upside

22:12.030 --> 22:13.632
of all of those
stress hormones?

22:13.699 --> 22:15.801
{\an3}The adrenaline, the cortisol,
all of those endorphins

22:15.867 --> 22:18.036
{\an3}that act as natural
painkillers?

22:18.103 --> 22:21.106
{\an5}She's not chasing a high.

22:18.103 --> 22:21.106
She's self-medicating.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.375
The hand cramp isn't
the problem. It's...

22:23.442 --> 22:25.510
{\an1}it's the solution
to the problem,

22:25.577 --> 22:28.980
Which is... chronic pain.

22:29.047 --> 22:31.083
Okay, let's get an MRI.

22:31.149 --> 22:33.752
{\an1}Whatever's causing this pain,
jumping out of a airplane

22:33.819 --> 22:35.954
{\an1}can't be the only way
to treat it.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.757
{\an4}I'm on it.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.757
Thank you.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.105
{\an5}Hey.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.105
{\an1}Mm. Hey.

22:53.171 --> 22:55.574
{\an5}(clears throat)

22:53.171 --> 22:55.574
You want some company?

22:55.640 --> 22:58.009
Sure.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.513
I thought you were in
the valve replacement.

23:01.580 --> 23:03.548
Yeah, uh, so, Sam
gave me the, uh,

23:03.615 --> 23:05.584
{\an3}bypass surgery
at the last minute.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.486
You were primary?

23:08.887 --> 23:10.856
Oh, that's great.
How do you feel?

23:10.922 --> 23:13.125
Yeah, good. I, uh,

23:13.191 --> 23:15.694
just need to, um, come down

23:15.761 --> 23:17.529
a bit from the adrenaline rush.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.431
Mm.

23:23.468 --> 23:27.572
All right.
Well, uh, you do that,

23:27.639 --> 23:30.008
and come find me later.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.676
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.676
All right.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.578
{\an5}Hey, do me a favor.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.578
{\an3}Hmm?

23:33.645 --> 23:36.014
Just slip that back
in the charger,

23:36.081 --> 23:38.550
preferably
when Donna's not looking.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.685
What did you do?

23:40.752 --> 23:42.954
Did you drop it?

23:43.021 --> 23:44.790
No. It was like that
when I found it.

23:44.856 --> 23:46.491
Liar.

23:46.558 --> 23:48.160
And what if Donna
thinks I broke it?

23:48.226 --> 23:50.095
You say it was like that
when you found it.

23:58.870 --> 24:01.106
(footsteps approaching)

24:02.140 --> 24:04.609
What are you doing with
the quarterly reports?

24:04.676 --> 24:06.478
Reading them.

24:06.545 --> 24:09.181
I would have used your father's
office, but I couldn't find it.

24:09.247 --> 24:11.449
{\an5}Uh, he doesn't have one.

24:09.247 --> 24:11.449
Doesn't have one?

24:11.516 --> 24:14.452
What, does he do-- skulk around
like Phantom of the Opera?

24:14.519 --> 24:16.988
I have work.
Whatever you're doing,

24:17.055 --> 24:18.990
can you do it
somewhere else, please?

24:20.826 --> 24:23.028
(sighs)

24:24.062 --> 24:26.131
We never talked
about my leaving.

24:26.198 --> 24:28.066
What is there to say?

24:29.801 --> 24:31.503
You left. The end.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.704
I left him.

24:32.771 --> 24:35.473
I didn't leave you.

24:35.540 --> 24:37.042
And I didn't leave
because I wanted to.

24:37.108 --> 24:38.710
I left because I had to.

24:38.777 --> 24:42.581
{\an5}You had to?

24:38.777 --> 24:42.581
{\an1}There's only one way
with your father.

24:42.647 --> 24:45.617
If you can be
what he wants you to be,

24:45.684 --> 24:47.619
if you can stay
within those lines

24:47.686 --> 24:49.754
that he draws for you,
then you're good.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.857
But I couldn't do it, Malcolm.

24:51.923 --> 24:54.092
{\an1}I knew that if I chose
to be myself,

24:54.159 --> 24:56.494
{\an1}it would cost me
the marriage.

24:56.561 --> 24:59.698
But I never imagined
it would cost me my son.

25:00.699 --> 25:02.133
{\an1}And I hope

25:02.200 --> 25:04.636
it's not too late
to get him back.

25:04.703 --> 25:06.638
How can I trust you

25:06.705 --> 25:08.540
after all this time? I...

25:08.607 --> 25:11.142
I'm not asking for your trust.

25:11.209 --> 25:15.180
I'm asking you to give me
a chance to earn your trust.

25:17.249 --> 25:19.651
I-I need to get to work.

25:21.720 --> 25:25.557
Yeah. Yeah, me too.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.260
Um, you know,

25:28.326 --> 25:31.696
{\an1}I know this hospital
better than you think.

25:31.763 --> 25:33.765
{\an3}I could do some...
some good around here.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.967
With your blessing,
of course. But, um,

25:36.034 --> 25:37.836
if you want me to leave, I...

25:37.903 --> 25:40.171
I can be on the next flight.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.560
{\an5}SAM: Ready for the valve,
Dr. Shah.

25:59.224 --> 26:02.560
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

26:02.627 --> 26:05.830
A new valve
in healthy 18-year-old?

26:05.897 --> 26:07.766
You don't see that every day.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.705
Hold on.
Something's not right here.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.040
I need more light.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.778
Look at this.

26:19.844 --> 26:21.279
Annular calcification.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.281
{\an5}But that didn't show up
in the echo.

26:21.346 --> 26:23.281
No, it did not.

26:23.348 --> 26:26.284
The annulus is supposed
to be firm. This is like Jell-O.

26:26.351 --> 26:29.020
{\an5}Liquefactive necrosis.

26:26.351 --> 26:29.020
I can't attach

26:29.087 --> 26:30.989
the metal to this tissue.
It's too viscous.

26:31.056 --> 26:32.290
I...

26:32.357 --> 26:34.359
There's literally nothing
for me to sew into.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.261
{\an3}You need something
more pliable.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.697
BP and O2 sats
are trending down.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.000
{\an5}Call down for
a bioprosthetic valve, stat.

26:38.763 --> 26:42.000
{\an3}Wh...

26:42.067 --> 26:43.168
A pig valve?

26:43.234 --> 26:44.736
Well, it's not
a vegan option,

26:44.803 --> 26:47.672
but it'll keep her alive.

26:49.941 --> 26:52.610
Telling a vegan mother
you put a pig valve

26:52.677 --> 26:55.280
in her vegan daughter's heart?
Not the high point of my day.

26:55.347 --> 26:56.982
Well, that valve
is also keeping her alive.

26:57.048 --> 26:58.650
(clears throat)

26:58.717 --> 26:59.517
Oh.

26:59.584 --> 27:02.754
{\an5}Thanks, man. I appreciate it.

26:59.584 --> 27:02.754
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

27:02.821 --> 27:05.623
And also... I love you.

27:05.690 --> 27:07.125
What?

27:07.192 --> 27:09.194
{\an5}Nothing.

27:07.192 --> 27:09.194
{\an3}You did it!

27:09.260 --> 27:10.895
Good for you, Dr. Tucker.

27:10.962 --> 27:13.898
{\an5}What?

27:10.962 --> 27:13.898
He accidentally said
"I love you" to Sam.

27:13.965 --> 27:16.167
We're trying to normalize it
so it's not such a big deal.

27:16.234 --> 27:18.269
That advice is why
some of us are engaged

27:18.336 --> 27:20.071
and why others
are going to die alone.

27:20.138 --> 27:21.639
Look, I'm desperate, man, okay?

27:21.706 --> 27:23.308
I cannot let things get weird
with me and Sam.

27:23.375 --> 27:25.176
So, this is
the not-weird solution?

27:25.243 --> 27:26.778
Just go with it.

27:26.845 --> 27:28.780
Fine.

27:28.847 --> 27:31.282
Say it again.

27:32.984 --> 27:34.319
I love you.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.887
You're not my type.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.158
That stung a little.

27:43.728 --> 27:46.865
Operative report-- dotted
the I's, crossed the T's.

27:46.931 --> 27:49.234
{\an1}Does that report mention
the scalpel that you dropped?

27:49.300 --> 27:51.002
Why would it?

27:51.069 --> 27:53.405
Because I've never
seen you drop an instrument.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.206
I told you, it was the lights.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.709
I've also never heard you
complain about the lights.

27:57.776 --> 27:59.344
{\an1}I'm worried
that I put you in too soon,

27:59.411 --> 28:01.012
{\an1}and I want
to sign off on this,

28:01.079 --> 28:02.680
but I need to understand
what happened in there.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.182
{\an3}A successful bypass
is what happened.

28:04.249 --> 28:05.817
Who cares about a scalpel?

28:05.884 --> 28:07.952
I'll tell you who cares.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.120
Dad.

28:09.187 --> 28:11.756
Tina Kingsley cares.

28:11.823 --> 28:13.925
{\an1}She's raising questions
about your competency

28:13.992 --> 28:15.427
after what she saw.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.329
{\an5}I told you she never liked me.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.329
I covered for you.

28:18.396 --> 28:21.866
I said there was nothing
to worry about. Is that true?

28:21.933 --> 28:23.968
It was the lights.

28:34.012 --> 28:36.114
I heard what happened
with the scalpel.

28:36.181 --> 28:37.816
Scrub nurses like to gossip.

28:37.882 --> 28:39.884
{\an3}And what, you think
I'm being too hard on him?

28:39.951 --> 28:41.920
Because it was my idea to
put him back in surgery.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.755
{\an5}I know.

28:41.986 --> 28:43.755
{\an3}This is just
due diligence.

28:43.822 --> 28:45.123
I want to clear him.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.791
I don't think you should.

28:46.858 --> 28:49.828
{\an5}You don't think he's ready?

28:46.858 --> 28:49.828
{\an1}I think

28:49.894 --> 28:53.131
he should be ready.
I think he thinks he's ready.

28:53.198 --> 28:54.499
But?

28:54.566 --> 28:57.802
That scalpel's not
the only thing he's dropped.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.780
(alarms sounding)

29:08.847 --> 29:10.982
Her hands are ice-cold
and she won't wake up.

29:11.049 --> 29:12.016
Heart rate's 140.

29:12.083 --> 29:13.251
Why is she so tachycardic?

29:13.318 --> 29:15.186
And hypotensive.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.387
{\an3}Blood pressure's
90/40 and dropping.

29:16.454 --> 29:17.856
Maybe she's turning septic.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.324
{\an3}Have we gotten
another H and H?

29:19.390 --> 29:20.525
{\an1}There's no fever, she hasn't
lost any blood volume.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.893
{\an3}Could she be
rejecting the valve?

29:21.960 --> 29:22.994
{\an1}GRIFF:
No, acute and chronic rejection

29:23.061 --> 29:24.262
takes weeks to occur.

29:24.329 --> 29:26.030
{\an1}She's been out
of surgery about an hour.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.332
{\an5}Could be hyperacute.

29:26.097 --> 29:27.332
{\an1}SAM: No.

29:27.398 --> 29:28.333
Then we would've known
before we closed up.

29:28.399 --> 29:29.334
This is something else.

29:29.400 --> 29:30.502
What's happening?

29:30.568 --> 29:32.470
Her heart is failing.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.439
I need you to increase her
Levophed, get another pressor.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.041
We got to get her pressure up,
and I want a cardiac MRI

29:37.108 --> 29:38.910
as soon as she is stable.

29:38.977 --> 29:41.980
Her body hates this valve.
I want to know why.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.083
Postoperative ultrasound
confirmed

29:45.150 --> 29:46.417
the graft was seamless.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.319
Well, installation's
not the problem.

29:48.386 --> 29:51.089
{\an4}Maybe it's a defect
in the valve?

29:48.386 --> 29:51.089
{\an3}Well...

29:51.156 --> 29:53.525
{\an1}I'm gonna check the production
lot for reported problems.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.830
Look at the leaflets
on the mitral valve.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.801
{\an5}SAM: They're so stiff.

30:01.366 --> 30:03.801
{\an1}Uh-huh.

30:03.868 --> 30:05.937
And what are those spots?

30:06.004 --> 30:07.238
They look like goosebumps.

30:07.305 --> 30:09.274
Or hives.

30:09.340 --> 30:11.276
{\an1}Can we see
if there's inflammation, please?

30:13.545 --> 30:15.246
{\an1}Ah.

30:15.313 --> 30:16.581
Lit up like a Christmas tree.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.116
That is an allergic reaction.

30:18.183 --> 30:20.118
But to what?

30:20.185 --> 30:21.452
{\an3}Anesthesia's out
of her system.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.454
{\an3}The only thing she could
be reacting to...

30:23.521 --> 30:25.890
The valve itself.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.163
She's allergic to meat?

30:32.230 --> 30:34.232
To animal protein, yes.

30:34.299 --> 30:37.869
I've never heard of this.
What did you say it's called?

30:37.936 --> 30:39.837
Alpha-gal syndrome.

30:39.904 --> 30:42.407
{\an1}It's a reaction to the
sugar molecule in most mammals.

30:42.473 --> 30:44.242
{\an1}SAM:
It is a severe allergy,

30:44.309 --> 30:48.179
{\an1}but because Violet's never eaten
meat, she was never diagnosed.

30:48.246 --> 30:50.014
She was fine.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.984
She had a broken rib,
but she was fine.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.420
How did things
get so bad so fast?

30:55.486 --> 30:58.089
{\an3}I know that
she seemed fine,

30:58.156 --> 31:02.193
{\an3}but something has been
damaging her heart.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.494
{\an3}But you don't
know what it is.

31:03.561 --> 31:05.163
The mechanical valve
didn't work.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.865
The pig valve isn't working.
Her heart is failing.

31:07.932 --> 31:10.435
{\an1}Which is why we need
to give her a new one.

31:16.307 --> 31:19.644
{\an3}Your MRI shows that
you have spinal stenosis.

31:21.546 --> 31:24.015
{\an3}It's the narrowing
of your spinal cavity

31:24.082 --> 31:26.384
that's compressing your nerves
and causing your chronic pain.

31:26.451 --> 31:27.919
Well, can you fix it?

31:27.986 --> 31:30.455
{\an3}Mm-hmm. It's called
a laminectomy.

31:30.521 --> 31:32.457
{\an3}We remove part
of your vertebra

31:32.523 --> 31:34.392
{\an3}to ease the pressure
on your nerves.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.361
Sounds complicated.

31:36.427 --> 31:38.096
There are risks, but

31:38.162 --> 31:41.633
the bigger the risk,
the bigger the rush, right?

31:44.369 --> 31:46.938
Look, April,

31:47.005 --> 31:50.375
I know you found a way
to cope with your pain,

31:50.441 --> 31:52.610
but it's just temporary.

31:52.677 --> 31:55.179
Problems like these do not
go away on their own.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.449
In fact, they usually get worse.

32:09.527 --> 32:11.696
{\an6}SAM:
Lying down in the
middle of a shift?

32:11.763 --> 32:13.464
This is another first, Dad.

32:13.531 --> 32:14.966
It's low blood sugar.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.935
{\an5}Or post-exertional malaise.

32:15.033 --> 32:17.935
(sighs)

32:18.002 --> 32:19.470
Is that why you ducked out of

32:19.537 --> 32:21.606
{\an5}the valve replacement surgery?

32:19.537 --> 32:21.606
I'll have some

32:21.673 --> 32:23.608
trail mix, I'll be fine.

32:23.675 --> 32:26.210
I want to run a blood panel
on you, a full workup.

32:26.277 --> 32:27.478
Whoa! Why?

32:27.545 --> 32:29.614
{\an1}Because I know
about the headaches

32:29.681 --> 32:31.349
and the ringing in your ears,

32:31.416 --> 32:34.152
the photosensitivity.

32:34.218 --> 32:37.488
{\an3}And I hear you dropped a tablet
in addition to that scalpel.

32:37.555 --> 32:39.223
(sighs)

32:39.290 --> 32:41.626
Et tu, Brute?

32:41.693 --> 32:43.294
I'm worried about you.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.363
{\an5}Ignoring this isn't gonna
make it go away.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.363
SAM: I can't

32:45.430 --> 32:47.665
clear you for surgery unless
we address these symptoms.

32:47.732 --> 32:49.400
Symptoms? It's nothing.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.235
It's a little bit
of anemia or something.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.072
Maybe. But the headaches
could be a sentinel bleed,

32:54.138 --> 32:55.373
or a subarachnoid
hemorrhage, or...

32:55.440 --> 32:57.108
{\an5}Or a tumor.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.108
{\an3}Mm.

32:57.175 --> 33:00.044
(sighs)
I see no cause for alarm.

33:00.111 --> 33:03.981
Neither did our patient
until her heart started to fail.

33:04.048 --> 33:06.384
You need bloodwork and scans.

33:06.451 --> 33:07.585
I'm not having a scan.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.720
Dad, this is serious.

33:08.786 --> 33:10.521
So am I.
Word gets out--

33:10.588 --> 33:12.323
Tina Kingsley finds out--
it's all over.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.325
{\an3}Forget it.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.661
{\an3}Okay, fine. Just
bloodwork for now.

33:16.728 --> 33:18.563
I can get around Bernie.

33:20.398 --> 33:22.166
Yeah, I think I prefer it

33:22.233 --> 33:24.736
when you two
don't talk to each other.

33:31.309 --> 33:33.544
(elevator bell dings)

33:34.379 --> 33:36.247
{\an4}Uh...

33:34.379 --> 33:36.247
{\an3}Going down?

33:36.314 --> 33:37.682
Uh, yeah, to the lab.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.553
{\an4}Thanks.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.553
{\an3}Yeah.

33:45.089 --> 33:47.492
{\an1}How are things going
with your mom?

33:47.558 --> 33:50.795
Mm. She wants
a fresh start.

33:50.862 --> 33:53.564
{\an3}Not that she has any
right to ask for that.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.467
You're probably right.

33:56.534 --> 33:59.103
But you could still
give her one.

33:59.170 --> 34:02.673
{\an1}Sometimes people
just need a second chance,

34:02.740 --> 34:05.676
you know, before it's too late.

34:15.585 --> 34:17.522
{\an1}I've got some bloodwork
for you, Bernie.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.090
Who's the patient?

34:19.157 --> 34:22.159
{\an1}Um, I didn't put a name.
Say it's me?

34:22.226 --> 34:23.594
Is it you?

34:23.661 --> 34:25.530
How about we say yes
and I'll owe you one.

34:25.596 --> 34:29.801
{\an3}You and everybody else.
It's death by a thousand cuts.

34:35.406 --> 34:37.475
{\an1}Hang on.
Bernie, can you run labs

34:37.542 --> 34:39.577
on something that isn't human?

34:43.147 --> 34:45.081
{\an1}Why did you want to see
all the supplements we take?

34:45.149 --> 34:46.751
So that our lab could test them.

34:46.818 --> 34:49.152
{\an5}Test them for what?

34:46.818 --> 34:49.152
{\an3}We know

34:49.219 --> 34:50.021
Violet has alpha-gal.

34:50.087 --> 34:52.489
{\an5}The meat allergy.

34:50.087 --> 34:52.489
Yes, which explains

34:52.556 --> 34:53.757
{\an1}your reaction
to the pig valve.

34:53.824 --> 34:55.159
What it doesn't explain is

34:55.226 --> 34:56.561
{\an1}the heart condition
you came in with,

34:56.627 --> 34:58.629
{\an3}because you are
a lifelong vegan.

34:58.696 --> 35:00.565
{\an3}Whatever's been
damaging Violet's heart,

35:00.631 --> 35:03.167
{\an3}we assumed it had to be
something other than meat.

35:03.234 --> 35:06.103
{\an1}But she has no other conditions,
no other factors

35:06.170 --> 35:08.306
{\an1}that could explain
the damage to her heart.

35:08.372 --> 35:10.208
It had to be the alpha-gal.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.242
Which means you had

35:11.309 --> 35:12.510
to be consuming meat.

35:12.577 --> 35:14.212
Your vitamin B-12

35:14.278 --> 35:18.115
{\an3}supplements are
encased in a capsule

35:18.182 --> 35:20.251
{\an3}derived from
animal proteins.

35:20.318 --> 35:23.120
{\an1}Now, the amount
in each capsule is too small

35:23.187 --> 35:24.455
to trigger an outward reaction.

35:24.522 --> 35:26.424
But the chronic insult

35:26.491 --> 35:29.594
to your system damaged
your heart over time.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.163
{\an5}The label says they're vegan.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.163
{\an3}Yes.

35:32.230 --> 35:34.665
{\an1}But supplements are
not regulated by the FDA.

35:34.732 --> 35:36.534
{\an1}The-the labels,
the ingredients--

35:36.601 --> 35:38.669
{\an1}they're not verified the way the
prescription medications are.

35:38.736 --> 35:41.706
So, I-I've been
taking meat pills?

35:42.807 --> 35:44.308
The good news is that you are at

35:44.375 --> 35:45.776
the top
of the transplant list,

35:45.843 --> 35:48.246
and it is not too late
for a new start.

35:48.312 --> 35:50.581
{\an1}We're gonna get a nutritionist.
We'll make meal plans.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.850
{\an5}We're gonna be okay.

35:50.648 --> 35:52.850
Stop saying "we."

35:52.917 --> 35:54.719
{\an1}What?

35:54.785 --> 35:56.787
We're not the same person.

35:56.854 --> 36:01.559
If it were up to me,
maybe I wouldn't even be vegan.

36:01.626 --> 36:02.827
I might have eaten
a hamburger by now

36:02.894 --> 36:04.829
{\an1}and found out
about this sooner.

36:04.896 --> 36:06.464
None of this would've happened

36:06.531 --> 36:08.900
if you had just let me
make my own decisions.

36:08.966 --> 36:10.868
{\an1}Violet, I was just trying
to do what I thought...

36:10.935 --> 36:12.770
Well, you were wrong.

36:18.576 --> 36:20.177
Donor match for Violet Stein.

36:20.244 --> 36:22.179
{\an5}We got a hit?

36:20.244 --> 36:22.179
Yeah. She'll have a new heart

36:22.246 --> 36:24.181
{\an5}by tomorrow.

36:22.246 --> 36:24.181
{\an1}CALEB:
I'll get her on the schedule.

36:24.248 --> 36:26.684
{\an3}Okay, great, and I'll
notify the family. Okay.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.786
{\an5}Oh. Sorry.

36:26.751 --> 36:28.786
{\an1}(laughs)

36:29.520 --> 36:31.789
You know what?
Uh, after you.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.457
{\an5}You go.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.457
{\an1}I...

36:33.524 --> 36:35.226
Okay, I'll go.

36:37.295 --> 36:38.863
What was that?

36:38.930 --> 36:42.466
That was... awkward.

36:42.533 --> 36:43.901
{\an3}Mm.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.404
I accidentally said
"I love you."

36:46.470 --> 36:48.439
{\an6}(gasps)

36:46.470 --> 36:48.439
{\an1}I've been trying
to undo it, but...

36:48.506 --> 36:50.408
Why, because you don't love her?

36:53.544 --> 36:55.713
(scoffs softly)

36:57.381 --> 36:59.417
(glass breaking)

37:00.017 --> 37:02.219
(glass pieces clinking)

37:02.820 --> 37:04.655
Everything okay?

37:04.722 --> 37:06.524
{\an5}Yeah. Uh...

37:04.722 --> 37:06.524
{\an1}Well,

37:06.591 --> 37:07.892
I can do this if you want

37:07.959 --> 37:09.493
to join Dr. Griffith
and tell the family

37:09.560 --> 37:10.861
about the transplant.

37:10.928 --> 37:13.965
No. I got to, uh,
get to the lab, anyway, so...

37:14.031 --> 37:16.267
Okay.

37:21.572 --> 37:24.275
Dad says once you break trust,
it's gone.

37:24.342 --> 37:27.578
{\an3}I know he'd say
this is a mistake,

37:27.645 --> 37:30.581
but if you want to stay...

37:30.648 --> 37:34.318
I won't stop you.

37:34.952 --> 37:36.921
Thank you for this chance.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.724
{\an3}I hope I don't
regret it.

37:40.992 --> 37:43.794
All I want
is to make things better

37:43.861 --> 37:46.998
for us and for this hospital.

37:47.865 --> 37:49.266
Starting with

37:49.333 --> 37:51.502
the cardiothoracic department.

38:00.645 --> 38:02.013
Hey.

38:02.079 --> 38:03.381
{\an3}Hey.

38:03.447 --> 38:04.915
{\an3}Look, I know you're
out of the race,

38:04.982 --> 38:06.917
but I just want
to let you know

38:06.984 --> 38:09.620
{\an3}that my mom has some plans
for your department.

38:09.687 --> 38:10.688
What do you mean?

38:10.755 --> 38:11.722
Well, she's opening the position

38:11.789 --> 38:12.923
to outside candidates.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.292
{\an3}Thought your dad
might like to know

38:15.359 --> 38:17.561
that he won't be running
unopposed for too long.

38:17.628 --> 38:20.631
Um... I'll tell him.

38:20.698 --> 38:22.833
Yeah.

38:22.900 --> 38:23.934
So...

38:24.001 --> 38:27.538
she's sticking around, then?

38:27.605 --> 38:29.440
Yeah.

38:29.507 --> 38:33.010
Uh, I'm gonna try this whole
second chance thing.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.914
I'm still so sorry.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.784
No, no, don't. Hey, it's okay.

38:39.850 --> 38:42.453
{\an3}It's just, I-I got
to figure out

38:42.520 --> 38:44.455
this stuff with my mom
right now, and...

38:44.522 --> 38:47.892
I get it.
You don't have to explain.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.595
I will see you around.

38:52.596 --> 38:54.498
I'll see you around.

38:54.565 --> 38:56.600
Okay.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.009
{\an3}Hey.

39:05.076 --> 39:06.744
How'd it go in there?

39:06.811 --> 39:08.112
Oh, yeah, she's stable.

39:08.179 --> 39:10.114
{\an1}Um, I just finished the
paperwork for the transplant.

39:10.181 --> 39:14.719
{\an3}Her mom was just doing what she
thought was best, wasn't she?

39:14.785 --> 39:16.554
She didn't know what
her daughter needed.

39:16.620 --> 39:20.991
This morning, what I said, um,

39:21.058 --> 39:23.627
{\an1}is probably
the last thing you need.

39:23.694 --> 39:26.363
It was probably the worst
possible time to say it,

39:26.430 --> 39:28.566
{\an1}but I did, and I don't want
to pretend like I didn't.

39:28.632 --> 39:30.468
What did you say?

39:31.102 --> 39:33.003
I said "I love you."

39:33.637 --> 39:35.873
{\an1}Which you clearly didn't hear.
(laughs)

39:35.940 --> 39:39.910
{\an1}Um, but that's-that's good,
because it just

39:39.977 --> 39:42.947
slipped out. It was an accident,
and it shouldn't have happened.

39:43.814 --> 39:46.484
At least, not like that.

39:46.550 --> 39:49.453
What are you saying?

39:49.520 --> 39:52.957
I... love you.

39:54.759 --> 39:56.994
I love you.

39:57.061 --> 39:59.663
Oh. That's how
it should've happened.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.899
Because that's how I feel.

40:01.966 --> 40:04.001
And now you know.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.415
What are you doing in here?

40:18.482 --> 40:19.884
{\an3}I always used
to come down here

40:19.950 --> 40:21.886
before surgery and after.

40:21.952 --> 40:26.090
Your mother would say,
"He's in church."

40:26.924 --> 40:28.926
{\an1}Me too.

40:28.993 --> 40:30.828
Hmm.

40:31.462 --> 40:35.466
{\an1}Tina Kingsley is widening
the search for chief.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.568
She's not gonna make it easy
for me, is she?

40:37.635 --> 40:38.969
You'll be fine.

40:39.036 --> 40:42.840
Your history and relationships.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.775
No one can compete with you.

40:44.842 --> 40:47.778
I know one person who can.

40:47.845 --> 40:49.213
I told you I'm out, Dad.

40:49.280 --> 40:50.981
{\an3}Well, maybe you
should reconsider.

40:51.048 --> 40:53.918
Better you
than an outsider, right?

40:53.984 --> 40:56.921
What about you?

40:58.289 --> 41:02.493
You got your test results.

41:02.560 --> 41:03.861
Not anemia.

41:03.928 --> 41:05.529
{\an1}Okay.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.865
That doesn't mean
it's a worst-case scenario.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.233
Doesn't rule it out, either.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.469
This race may be decided for me.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.471
If it is, I would prefer
you to be the one...

41:14.538 --> 41:18.175
Stop. We're not talking about
work. We're going to imaging.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.512
No arguments.

41:27.151 --> 41:30.087
{\an1}Thanks for telling me
about this.

41:32.089 --> 41:34.625
{\an3}Thanks for telling me
about his symptoms.

41:36.093 --> 41:38.729
{\an3}I'm really glad
you're here.

41:39.730 --> 41:41.265
{\an1}Me too.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.102
{\an5}GRIFF:
Just want to remind you
of a little thing called

41:45.169 --> 41:47.538
doctor-patient confidentiality.

41:47.605 --> 41:49.540
A-And Sam?

41:50.174 --> 41:53.244
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna tell Mom.
