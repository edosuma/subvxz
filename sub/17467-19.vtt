00:01.653 --> 00:04.221
Hi, Christy, alcoholic.GROUP: Hi, Christy.

00:04.265 --> 00:06.136
I know I've shared
about this before...

00:06.180 --> 00:08.095
Yeah, yeah, I was a crappy mom.

00:08.138 --> 00:09.444
Let it go.

00:09.487 --> 00:12.142
I'm talking about being lonely.

00:12.186 --> 00:14.014
Oh, great, carry on.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.453
So, anyway, there's this
cute guy at my school,

00:18.496 --> 00:21.543
and we'd been doing
the smiley, flirty thing

00:21.586 --> 00:23.240
for a couple of weeks,

00:23.284 --> 00:25.460
and one day I just
got tired of waiting

00:25.503 --> 00:28.115
for him to make a move
and I gave him my number.

00:28.158 --> 00:30.117
He seemed
really excited,

00:30.160 --> 00:34.164
said he was gonna call,
so, crazy me, I believed him.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.906
I mean, he drives a Prius.

00:36.949 --> 00:39.561
Prius equals sincere,
everybody knows that.

00:39.604 --> 00:43.478
Except Brad-- that's his
name-- never called.

00:43.521 --> 00:46.394
So I give him
the benefit of the doubt.

00:46.437 --> 00:48.178
Maybe a parent died,
maybe he died.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.223
I was hoping he died.

00:50.224 --> 00:51.442
And then
this morning

00:51.486 --> 00:53.096
there he was,

00:53.140 --> 00:57.579
walking across campus,
so not dead.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.102
And that's when it hit me,

00:59.146 --> 01:00.538
I'm gonna be alone forever.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.236
[phone vibrates]

01:02.279 --> 01:03.367
[sighs]

01:03.411 --> 01:06.196
I have been sober
for almost four years,

01:06.240 --> 01:07.632
and, yes, my life
is better for it,

01:07.676 --> 01:10.157
but nobody told me
that leading a clean life

01:10.200 --> 01:11.680
meant putting my vagina
up on blocks.

01:13.638 --> 01:15.249
[phone vibrates]

01:15.292 --> 01:18.991
Would the owner of the phone
or vibrator please turn it off?

01:20.471 --> 01:21.951
It's your phone.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.126
What?

01:24.171 --> 01:25.172
Oh.

01:25.215 --> 01:26.477
Sorry.

01:26.521 --> 01:28.610
But it is something
you would do.

01:30.394 --> 01:33.310
[sighs] I'm just saying
that when it comes to love,

01:33.354 --> 01:35.225
sobriety isn't doing
me any good at all.

01:35.269 --> 01:36.966
I may as well be a...

01:37.009 --> 01:39.099
Oh, my God,

01:39.142 --> 01:40.361
it's a text from Brad.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.146
He lost his phone,
he just found it,

01:43.190 --> 01:45.583
he's really sorry, and he
wants to take me to dinner.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.498
GROUP:
Aw.

01:47.542 --> 01:51.633
Anyway,
sobriety's amazing, thanks.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.678
â™ª

02:08.866 --> 02:11.435
Okay, babe, I'm
gonna head home.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.916
You really need to drag
all that back and forth

02:13.959 --> 02:15.744
every time you spend the night?

02:15.787 --> 02:17.833
Oh, you poor, simple man.

02:19.661 --> 02:22.794
You think this just
magically happens?

02:23.665 --> 02:25.710
This requires equipment.

02:25.754 --> 02:27.016
Such as?

02:27.059 --> 02:30.193
Forgetting about clothing,
underwear, shoes,

02:30.237 --> 02:33.762
lingerie for before,
sweatpants for after,

02:33.805 --> 02:35.677
there's also body lotion,

02:35.720 --> 02:37.722
face lotion, exfoliant,
night repair,

02:37.766 --> 02:40.551
eye cream, makeup,
which is a whole subcategory.

02:41.900 --> 02:43.511
Then you've got your
curling iron, blow dryer,

02:43.554 --> 02:44.729
shampoo, conditioner--

02:44.773 --> 02:46.601
which by the way,
is two separate things,

02:46.644 --> 02:48.472
no matter what it says
on that big jug

02:48.516 --> 02:49.821
of industrial crap you use.

02:50.953 --> 02:52.433
I have a blow dryer.

02:53.695 --> 02:55.349
Aw, you're so cute.

02:55.392 --> 02:57.351
You have a boy blow dryer.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.875
It's only good
for drying your balls.

03:00.789 --> 03:02.225
You saw me?

03:02.269 --> 03:03.661
Unfortunately.

03:05.402 --> 03:06.969
Why don't you just leave
all that stuff here?

03:07.012 --> 03:08.362
Oh, for God's sakes,

03:08.405 --> 03:09.624
because then I wouldn't have
my stuff at home.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.321
I can't afford to double up
on everything.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.367
Well, maybe all this going
back and forth isn't working.

03:13.410 --> 03:15.717
Maybe we need to make a change.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.718
Are we breaking up?

03:16.761 --> 03:18.372
'Cause I should warn you,

03:18.415 --> 03:20.504
I've been getting a lot
of hits on Farmers Only.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.463
Have you now?

03:22.506 --> 03:23.768
Yeah, you want to know why?

03:23.812 --> 03:26.423
'Cause city folk
just don't get it.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.469
What I'm trying to say is...

03:30.297 --> 03:33.300
...maybe you'd consider
moving in with me.

03:35.737 --> 03:36.781
Oh.
[chuckles]

03:38.043 --> 03:40.307
Wow.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.617
It'd be a hell of a lot
more practical.

03:46.661 --> 03:48.358
Practical.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.274
Be still my beating heart.

03:51.318 --> 03:52.841
You don't have to answer now.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.321
I'm just putting it out there.

03:54.364 --> 03:57.019
Okay, well...

03:57.062 --> 03:58.542
[strained]:
thanks for asking.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.463
I'm gonna need some time
to get quiet

04:06.507 --> 04:09.684
and... give it some thought.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.989
Cool.

04:11.033 --> 04:12.469
Let me know what Marjorie says.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.775
I will.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.866
All right,

04:17.909 --> 04:20.521
so I'm gonna ask the question
that's on everyone's mind,

04:20.564 --> 04:21.783
how bad was your date
last night?

04:21.826 --> 04:24.438
It was actually really good.

04:24.481 --> 04:26.962
So, did you guys...?No, he was a gentleman.

04:27.005 --> 04:28.920
Eh, well, I just tuned out.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.923
It was weird--
he asked me all these questions

04:31.967 --> 04:33.751
and listened to the answers

04:33.795 --> 04:35.710
and then remembered them
and mentioned them later.

04:35.753 --> 04:36.754
Gay alert.

04:37.973 --> 04:40.454
So where'd he take you?A vegan restaurant

04:40.497 --> 04:42.499
called The Sprouted Flute.

04:42.543 --> 04:44.022
[chuckles]
Did he bring his husband?

04:45.067 --> 04:47.025
Marjorie, make her stop.

04:47.069 --> 04:48.636
Ignore her, go on.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.682
The food was actually great.

04:51.726 --> 04:52.901
Brad says that the human body

04:52.944 --> 04:55.382
isn't really designed
to consume meat.

04:55.425 --> 04:56.948
If the good Lord didn't
want us to eat meat,

04:56.992 --> 04:58.472
why'd he invent veal?

05:00.952 --> 05:03.346
He knows so much about
the environment and food

05:03.390 --> 05:05.740
and politics.
Did you know that,

05:05.783 --> 05:08.351
in some parts of the world...Big news, Adam has asked me
to move in with him.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.700
[women gasp]What do you guys think?

05:09.744 --> 05:10.875
Well, I think it's a really...

05:10.919 --> 05:12.399
If you don't
mind, Marjorie?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.663
It's a big step,
Bonnie.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.839
That's what I was gonna say.

05:17.882 --> 05:19.971
BONNIE: Here's what
has me worried.

05:20.015 --> 05:22.017
We're getting along
great now, but,

05:22.060 --> 05:24.454
you know, it's like cocaine--
the first couple of lines,

05:24.498 --> 05:25.890
everything's good,
next thing you know,

05:25.934 --> 05:27.501
you're robbing a Laundromat
with no septum.

05:29.590 --> 05:30.852
So you're not
gonna do it?

05:30.895 --> 05:32.549
Hang on, Wendy.
Marjorie?

05:32.593 --> 05:35.117
Well, Bonnie, I think
it's a personal decision

05:35.160 --> 05:37.424
and you need
to pray on it...
Hey!

05:38.555 --> 05:39.861
I was in the middle
of saying something

05:39.904 --> 05:41.166
when you walked in.

05:42.472 --> 05:44.082
Sorry, finish.

05:44.126 --> 05:46.389
Thank you.

05:46.433 --> 05:48.870
Brad told me that,
in certain parts of the world,

05:48.913 --> 05:52.569
people are dying because they
don't have clean drinking water.

05:56.486 --> 05:57.879
And?

05:57.922 --> 06:02.013
That's it.
It's just really messed up.

06:03.058 --> 06:05.190
So what do you think? Should
I move in with Hot Wheels?

06:08.019 --> 06:09.543
Okay, now add
a slice of eggplant

06:09.586 --> 06:12.067
and hit that with another
scoop of cashew cheese.

06:12.110 --> 06:14.939
I just keep picturing
tiny little farmers

06:14.983 --> 06:16.898
trying to milk cashews.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.813
[laughs] You know,
before I became a vegan,

06:18.856 --> 06:21.424
my favorite meal in the world
was a bacon cheeseburger.

06:21.468 --> 06:23.470
And then I realized
I was tired all the time.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.862
I'm tired
all the time.

06:24.906 --> 06:26.603
And I couldn't focus.I can't focus.

06:26.647 --> 06:27.865
I was moody.

06:27.909 --> 06:30.085
I'm super moody.

06:30.128 --> 06:31.956
So you get it.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.958
Not really.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.046
Close your eyes.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.526
I want you to taste something.

06:36.570 --> 06:39.094
Okay, but just so you know,

06:39.137 --> 06:43.141
I once had a bad experience
with this exact scenario.

06:43.185 --> 06:44.839
Trust me.

06:44.882 --> 06:46.884
Yeah, he said that, too.

06:52.150 --> 06:53.761
Pretty great, huh?

06:56.677 --> 07:00.071
I really want to say yes.

07:00.115 --> 07:01.203
Give me another bite.

07:05.207 --> 07:06.948
Now this I like.

07:06.991 --> 07:08.210
Oops.

07:08.253 --> 07:10.125
Oh, sorry, uh...

07:10.168 --> 07:12.693
For kissing her? She's in
a serious slump; get at it.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.524
Brad, this is Bonnie, my mom.

07:17.567 --> 07:18.786
Bonnie, Brad.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.527
Captain Prius, nice to meet you.

07:22.137 --> 07:24.487
Brad and I are
making dinner.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.575
Oh, what are you cooking?

07:25.619 --> 07:28.056
Actually, nothing.

07:29.013 --> 07:30.232
Brad is showing me

07:30.275 --> 07:33.104
how to prepare a raw,
vegan lasagna.

07:33.844 --> 07:35.063
Why?

07:35.106 --> 07:36.064
Um...

07:36.107 --> 07:37.892
why are we doing this again?

07:37.935 --> 07:40.068
Eating raw food
is how human beings

07:40.111 --> 07:41.852
have thrived for
millions of years.

07:41.896 --> 07:45.116
Thrived? Those guys died at 18
and walked around like monkeys.

07:46.553 --> 07:47.858
All right, off you go.All right.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.164
See you.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.210
Shall we eat?

07:52.254 --> 07:53.908
I eat all the time.

07:53.951 --> 07:54.952
Kiss me.

07:59.827 --> 08:01.045
Hey.

08:01.089 --> 08:02.133
Hey.

08:02.177 --> 08:04.135
Ooh, that smells great.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.529
Yeah, couple of bone-in
rib eyes.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.183
Nice.

08:08.226 --> 08:10.968
You have no idea what's
going on back at my place.

08:11.012 --> 08:13.231
Christy's vegan boyfriend
is preparing a feast

08:13.275 --> 08:15.059
fit for a gerbil.[laughs]

08:15.103 --> 08:16.931
Oh, no, not one of those guys.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.585
Did he try to sell you on it?

08:18.628 --> 08:20.195
Oh, yeah, vegans and Mormons,

08:20.238 --> 08:21.196
always looking to turn you.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.893
[laughs]

08:22.937 --> 08:25.766
Hey, come here.
I want to show you something.

08:25.809 --> 08:28.203
I've seen it before, but I'm
always happy to take a peek.

08:32.033 --> 08:33.251
Ta-da.

08:33.294 --> 08:35.253
Oh, my God,

08:35.297 --> 08:37.255
what did you do?

08:37.299 --> 08:39.256
I thought I could make it easier
for you to spend the night.

08:41.825 --> 08:43.740
You thought of everything.

08:45.089 --> 08:46.047
Lot of loofahs.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.309
How many you think I needed?

08:47.352 --> 08:49.180
I figured it was like sandpaper,

08:49.224 --> 08:51.226
you get it for different
kinds of wood.

08:52.793 --> 08:54.882
Oh, Adam.

08:54.925 --> 08:56.187
I did good?

08:57.188 --> 08:59.060
You did really good.

09:03.151 --> 09:04.108
I love you.

09:04.152 --> 09:06.110
[laughing]:
I love you, too.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.159
I want to move in with you.

09:11.202 --> 09:12.203
Really?

09:12.247 --> 09:13.596
Yeah.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.206
[laughs]

09:15.250 --> 09:19.080
Oh, damaged women
are so easy to please.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.603
[crying]:
We really are.

09:20.647 --> 09:22.039
I know.

09:25.216 --> 09:26.653
BONNIE: So, with me
out of the way,

09:26.696 --> 09:28.089
you and Captain Prius will
have the run of the place.

09:28.132 --> 09:29.612
Stop calling him that.

09:29.656 --> 09:32.267
Okay, how about King Kale?

09:32.310 --> 09:35.357
You already used that one,
it wasn't funny the first time.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.619
All right, here's a new one:

09:36.663 --> 09:38.534
Jolly Green Average Height.

09:38.578 --> 09:42.320
Say what you want,
I really like Brad.

09:42.364 --> 09:44.366
Ooh, ooh! Tofu Gigio.

09:44.409 --> 09:46.498
Yeah, hilarious.

09:46.542 --> 09:51.286
In the meantime, last night he
introduced me to Tantric sex.

09:51.329 --> 09:53.331
Ugh, is that the sex
where you don't finish?

09:53.375 --> 09:54.594
Have you ever tried it?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.334
Not on purpose.

09:56.378 --> 09:59.424
The point of it is
learning self-control.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.165
Brad says that if
you're not thinking about

10:01.209 --> 10:03.690
where you're going, you get
to be present for where you are.

10:03.733 --> 10:06.693
Sounds like where you are would
be chafed and frustrated.

10:06.736 --> 10:08.738
I wouldn't expect you to get it.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.306
Clearly you didn't
get it either.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.003
Come on, grab a box, let's go.

10:13.047 --> 10:16.354
Brad says the orgasm
is greatly overrated.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.487
[Bonnie laughs hysterically]

10:19.836 --> 10:21.316
[continues laughing]

10:21.359 --> 10:23.448
All right, enough.

10:23.492 --> 10:25.363
Oh, sorry.
[chuckles]

10:25.407 --> 10:27.278
I think that's all of it.

10:28.976 --> 10:30.412
Wow.

10:30.455 --> 10:33.676
It's gonna be weird
around here without you.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.157
Yeah, but you know,
if you think about it,

10:36.200 --> 10:38.333
it's actually kind of cool.

10:38.376 --> 10:41.379
You and I came together
when we needed each other,

10:41.423 --> 10:44.208
we healed, and now we're
ready to move on.

10:48.430 --> 10:51.694
[crying]:
Why'd you have to say that?

10:51.738 --> 10:54.349
[crying]:
I don't know,
it just came out.

10:54.392 --> 10:56.177
But it's true.

10:56.220 --> 10:58.005
So true.

11:02.574 --> 11:04.707
[sniffs]
What is that smell?

11:04.751 --> 11:07.667
Brad hooked me up with
some natural deodorant.

11:07.710 --> 11:09.581
Well, it ain't working.

11:09.625 --> 11:12.367
I know.
[sniffles]

11:12.410 --> 11:15.239
That's okay.
I still love you.

11:15.283 --> 11:17.328
I love you, too.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.332
And I really hope
with all my heart

11:21.376 --> 11:23.857
that this works out for you.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.206
Thanks, babe.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.991
I guess this is good-bye.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.994
Yup. This is it.

11:31.038 --> 11:33.388
Okay.

11:34.650 --> 11:37.087
I'll see you at
the meeting tonight.

11:39.133 --> 11:41.091
[blow dryer whirring]

11:41.135 --> 11:42.397
[turns off]

11:48.446 --> 11:49.839
Babe?

11:54.148 --> 11:55.584
Hey. Where'd you go?

11:56.890 --> 11:59.544
To the bathroom.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.112
In the hallway?

12:02.156 --> 12:04.680
At my neighbor's.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.770
I don't understand, why didn't
you just use this one?

12:07.814 --> 12:10.773
Because somebody was
in there for 58 minutes.

12:10.817 --> 12:12.775
Hon, you sound like Christy.

12:12.819 --> 12:14.081
I wasn't in there that long.

12:14.124 --> 12:16.779
Price Is Rightstarted
and ended.

12:16.823 --> 12:20.783
The guy won a Toyota,
and I almost soiled my chair.

12:20.827 --> 12:23.133
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.

12:23.177 --> 12:24.352
Why didn't you say something?

12:24.395 --> 12:25.788
I banged on the door,

12:25.832 --> 12:28.617
but your jet-engine hair dryer
drowned me out.

12:28.660 --> 12:33.274
Wow, okay, can we file this one
under "lesson learned"?

12:33.317 --> 12:34.623
Yeah, sure.

12:34.666 --> 12:38.322
I don't even know my neighbor.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.803
Now I owe a favor
to a 43-year-old man

12:40.847 --> 12:44.851
who uses one-ply paper
and collects troll dolls.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.549
Again, I'm sorry.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.290
Forget it.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.161
We just probably
need to work out

12:51.205 --> 12:53.163
some kind of schedule.

12:53.207 --> 12:54.904
Yeah, we'll find our rhythm.

12:54.948 --> 12:57.777
What happened to my...

12:59.082 --> 13:00.475
Problem?

13:00.518 --> 13:01.781
No, it's just...

13:03.652 --> 13:06.046
...that's my Kennedy
Space Center mug.

13:08.091 --> 13:09.919
I didn't know it was special.

13:09.963 --> 13:12.226
Did you get it on a field trip?

13:13.444 --> 13:14.706
My dad gave it to me.

13:14.750 --> 13:17.492
Well, would you like to have it?

13:17.535 --> 13:19.929
No, no, it's fine.

13:19.973 --> 13:21.409
I'll just use one
that doesn't remind me

13:21.452 --> 13:23.237
of my late father.

13:24.716 --> 13:27.632
Whatever.

13:27.676 --> 13:29.547
[shudders]

13:29.591 --> 13:31.201
Okay, how about this?

13:31.245 --> 13:33.508
Why don't we go through
all the mugs,

13:33.551 --> 13:34.596
and you can tell me what's what?

13:34.639 --> 13:36.119
You know, don't
make this a thing.

13:36.163 --> 13:37.468
Oh, it's already a thing.

13:37.512 --> 13:39.514
Okay, Westfield Dry Cleaners.

13:39.557 --> 13:40.776
Can I drink out of this,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.430
or did they sponsor
your Little League team?

13:42.473 --> 13:44.693
Actually, an old girlfriend
left that here.

13:44.736 --> 13:45.781
Good to know.

13:49.002 --> 13:52.396
Next up, ooh, who's the slut
you took to Lake Tahoe?

13:55.704 --> 13:57.488
Thanks again for
making dinner.

13:57.532 --> 13:59.055
My pleasure.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.622
Mung bean pizza tastes
much better than

14:00.665 --> 14:02.102
regular pizza--
am I right?

14:02.145 --> 14:05.627
It certainly takes
longer to chew.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.586
Trust me, your colon's
gonna thank you.

14:08.630 --> 14:11.851
Well, the old girl's
trying to say something.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.983
Okay, let's get started.

14:14.027 --> 14:15.593
Now close your eyes.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.900
You gonna kiss me again?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
No, we're gonna meditate.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.861
Just as good.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.819
Take a deep, cleansing breath.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.866
Inhale... Exhale...

14:28.041 --> 14:30.130
[stomach rumbling]

14:32.219 --> 14:34.264
Sorry. Mung beans.

14:34.308 --> 14:36.701
Perfectly natural.

14:36.745 --> 14:39.617
And once again,
deep, centering breath.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.793
Peace in...

14:41.837 --> 14:44.274
fear out.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.233
[stomach rumbling]

14:48.104 --> 14:51.847
Wow, that one cracked a rib.

14:51.891 --> 14:55.938
Don't judge it.
Observe it.

14:55.982 --> 14:58.419
Observe it?
I can taste it.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.076
[gunfire, tires screeching
on TV]

15:06.035 --> 15:08.908
Hey.
Hey.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.871
[turns TV off]

15:15.915 --> 15:17.133
What you doing?

15:17.177 --> 15:18.787
Just going through the mail.

15:18.830 --> 15:20.658
You mean going through my mail?

15:20.702 --> 15:24.836
I think you mean,
"Thanks for bringing it in."

15:24.880 --> 15:27.665
Whatever, sure, thanks.

15:27.709 --> 15:28.928
[turns TV on]

15:28.971 --> 15:31.060
[gunfire, tires screeching
on TV]

15:31.104 --> 15:32.627
[turns TV off]

15:32.670 --> 15:35.325
It's just you've only been here
a couple of days.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.111
It's not likely that there's
anything there for you.

15:38.154 --> 15:39.242
What's the big deal?

15:39.286 --> 15:40.461
Were you expecting something

15:40.504 --> 15:41.984
from the Kennedy Space Center?

15:47.772 --> 15:50.645
You're right. You're right.
Forget it.

15:50.688 --> 15:52.299
[turns TV on]

16:03.223 --> 16:04.659
[turns TV off]

16:06.574 --> 16:07.618
Bon?

16:08.663 --> 16:11.144
Yeah?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.189
Jacket.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.414
Yeah.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.809
Love you.Yep!

16:24.853 --> 16:25.854
[turns TV on]

16:25.897 --> 16:29.118
Whoa! That was close.

16:32.034 --> 16:36.038
Really? We're doing
the Tantric thing every time?

16:36.082 --> 16:37.997
Yeah, what'd you think?

16:38.040 --> 16:42.566
I don't know, one on, one off?

16:42.610 --> 16:44.829
You're so funny.

16:46.309 --> 16:48.311
I'm gonna go floss.

16:51.880 --> 16:54.535
[stomach rumbling]

16:55.797 --> 16:57.277
Oh, shut up.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.020
[smacking, slurping]

17:07.939 --> 17:09.593
This was a good idea, Mom.

17:09.637 --> 17:11.595
Right? I hardly ever
get to see you,

17:11.638 --> 17:13.684
and this dinner gives us
a chance to get to know Brad.

17:13.728 --> 17:16.122
And also miss a
crucial playoff game.

17:17.819 --> 17:19.864
I told you to record it.

17:19.907 --> 17:23.041
A game like that
you need to watch live.

17:23.085 --> 17:24.217
Am I right, Brad?

17:24.260 --> 17:26.348
I wouldn't know,
I don't watch sports.

17:26.393 --> 17:28.002
Really?

17:28.047 --> 17:29.613
What, were you
raised by women?

17:30.875 --> 17:32.181
Yes.

17:33.835 --> 17:36.751
Brad's more of an outdoorsy guy.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.231
This morning, we took
a nature walk,

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
picked up litter,
and saw a fox.

17:41.495 --> 17:43.410
Well, Brad saw it.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.065
I was trying to spear
a condom with a stick.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.939
I hope you don't mind
that we brought our own food.

17:50.982 --> 17:52.462
I try not to be
one of "those people"

17:52.506 --> 17:54.377
who imposes their lifestyle
on others.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.813
You hear that?
Brad doesn't impose

17:55.857 --> 17:57.380
his lifestyle on others.

17:57.424 --> 17:59.774
Is this about
the towels again?

17:59.817 --> 18:01.732
I told you, I like 'em
folded in thirds.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.169
You didn't tell me,
you lectured me.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.213
Well, that's 'cause
when I said it nicely,

18:04.257 --> 18:05.475
you laughed at me.

18:05.519 --> 18:07.651
I thought you were kidding.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.352
Speaking of towels,

18:12.395 --> 18:13.875
Brad and I have been sharing one

18:13.918 --> 18:15.485
to cut down
on our water footprint.

18:15.529 --> 18:17.879
I've also turned her on
to mindful flushing.

18:17.922 --> 18:21.361
Yep. If it's yellow,
let it mellow.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.885
Or you could just cop
a squat at the neighbor's.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.933
How many times do I
have to say I'm sorry?

18:31.849 --> 18:35.462
These quinoa cakes came
out pretty good, huh?

18:35.505 --> 18:40.031
Quinoa, quin-wow!

18:40.075 --> 18:41.729
Christy, you sure
you don't want some ribs?

18:44.862 --> 18:45.863
They do look good.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.391
But I'm trying to make
healthier choices.

18:51.434 --> 18:53.480
It's not just
for our own sake.

18:53.523 --> 18:55.046
You do know that the
livestock industry

18:55.090 --> 18:56.396
is destroying our planet.

18:56.439 --> 18:58.311
No, Brad, I do not know that.

18:59.747 --> 19:02.663
Why don't you tell them
about your podcast?

19:02.706 --> 19:04.534
Oh, yeah, yeah, sure.
It's called

19:04.578 --> 19:06.449
Giving Up with Brad Partridge.

19:09.278 --> 19:11.324
So it's about assisted suicide?

19:11.367 --> 19:14.936
No. Thisis
assisted suicide.

19:17.112 --> 19:21.421
Brad teaches that happiness
is not about getting stuff,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.031
it's about giving stuff up.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.989
See, our culture
has it all wrong.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.166
We spend our entire lives
accumulating things

19:27.209 --> 19:28.906
when, really, we should
be giving them up.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.299
Like a cabinet full
of coffee mugs

19:30.343 --> 19:31.692
you think chronicle your life?

19:31.735 --> 19:33.563
Or a Ziploc Baggie
full of old hair extensions?

19:33.607 --> 19:34.869
You said that was my drawer.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.523
Why are you looking
in my drawer?

19:36.566 --> 19:37.872
Why you looking
at my mail?

19:37.915 --> 19:39.308
Maybe we should g...Why'd you ask me
to move in

19:39.352 --> 19:40.309
if you're gonna be so freakin'
weird about everything?

19:40.353 --> 19:41.354
ADAM:
I'm not weird about things.

19:41.397 --> 19:42.746
I'm specific.Oh, please.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.139
You're so anal, your ass
is folded into thirds.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.185
Aw, been nice knowing you.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.193
You have no idea
how happy I am

19:54.236 --> 19:55.411
to be in bed with you.

19:55.455 --> 19:58.371
Right back at you.

19:58.414 --> 20:01.765
Mmm... this is
the closest I've come

20:01.809 --> 20:04.551
to an orgasm in weeks.

20:04.594 --> 20:07.249
What did you see
in that guy, anyway?

20:07.293 --> 20:10.252
Come on, Mom,
he stood for something.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.950
He wanted to make the world
a better place and...

20:12.994 --> 20:17.433
Oh, who am I kidding?
He liked me.

20:17.477 --> 20:18.652
Are you that desperate?

20:18.695 --> 20:20.349
Yes, said the girl eating ribs

20:20.393 --> 20:21.872
in bed with her mother.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.440
Hey, can I get
in on that?

20:24.484 --> 20:27.530
Adam wouldn't let
me eat in bed.

20:27.574 --> 20:28.923
Are you guys
gonna be okay?

20:28.966 --> 20:29.924
Oh, yeah.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.317
We love each other,

20:31.360 --> 20:33.928
but three nights a week
is our magic number.

20:33.971 --> 20:36.278
My magic number with Brad
is minus nine,

20:36.322 --> 20:37.888
considering how many times
I went to sleep

20:37.932 --> 20:40.151
with a bag of frozen peas
between my legs.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.720
Mmm.

20:43.764 --> 20:45.940
They'rethe problem, right?

20:45.983 --> 20:47.594
Absolutely.
