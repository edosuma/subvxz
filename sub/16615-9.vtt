00:00.031 --> 00:02.334
<i>Previously on
"Once Upon A Time"...</i>

00:02.359 --> 00:05.015
I had a vision. I die.

00:05.148 --> 00:06.304
What's going on?

00:06.329 --> 00:07.648
Oh, I think you know...

00:07.684 --> 00:08.383
Mother.

00:08.418 --> 00:09.607
I'm here to warn you...

00:09.632 --> 00:12.666
Do not let him destroy us,
like he did his last family.

00:12.691 --> 00:16.359
You will never even
set eyes on this child.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.714
Let me remind you, dearie,

00:18.762 --> 00:21.896
that Rumplestiltskin
<i>takes</i> children,

00:21.931 --> 00:23.564
not the other way 'round.

00:34.644 --> 00:37.612
[Panting]

00:40.517 --> 00:43.217
There's nowhere to hide from me, dearie.

00:43.253 --> 00:44.552
Whatever you're doing,

00:44.587 --> 00:46.788
the Mother Superior won't
let you get away with it.

00:53.296 --> 00:56.486
That wingless glowworm won't stop me.

00:56.511 --> 00:57.510
None of you will.

00:58.479 --> 01:01.747
Evil Queen: What is it
between you and fairies?

01:02.298 --> 01:06.567
You never have told me why
you despise them so much.

01:07.929 --> 01:09.877
What are you doing here?

01:09.913 --> 01:11.779
[Chuckles] Oh, isn't it obvious?

01:11.804 --> 01:13.670
I came to join in the fun.

01:15.718 --> 01:19.220
Oh, I thought you'd
be happier to see me.

01:19.255 --> 01:20.421
And I will be,

01:20.457 --> 01:23.724
once you've taken care of
that problem we discussed.

01:23.760 --> 01:25.932
Oh, you mean Zelena.

01:25.957 --> 01:27.056
[Laughs]

01:27.081 --> 01:28.238
You don't really expect me

01:28.263 --> 01:30.947
to kill my own flesh and blood for you?

01:30.972 --> 01:33.011
Well, that depends
on how serious you are

01:33.036 --> 01:35.255
about these new beginnings
you say you want,

01:35.280 --> 01:38.347
because I think one of them involves me.

01:38.813 --> 01:40.412
Why should I believe

01:40.437 --> 01:43.088
you've at long last gotten over Belle?

01:43.182 --> 01:45.716
Because I've finally come to my senses.

01:46.853 --> 01:49.487
Belle won't accept me
for who I really am.

01:50.376 --> 01:53.177
I know you never really
wanted to rule alone.

01:53.393 --> 01:55.559
Well, you no longer have to.

01:55.595 --> 02:01.432
There's just one tiny
speck of green in your way.

02:03.264 --> 02:06.665
That being said, if you don't mind,

02:06.700 --> 02:08.933
I have my own problems to attend to.

02:09.495 --> 02:12.262
Which is what, exactly?

02:12.298 --> 02:15.532
I'm gonna send a message via fairy.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.817
[Sighs]

02:36.088 --> 02:38.021
So?

02:38.057 --> 02:41.364
It was the Dark One with the Evil Queen.

02:41.864 --> 02:43.448
They're together.

02:43.473 --> 02:45.129
Emma: I used magic like
that when I was the Dark One

02:45.164 --> 02:46.929
to speed up Zelena's pregnancy.

02:46.954 --> 02:48.988
This is about me!

02:49.268 --> 02:51.468
Rumple's going to do the same thing

02:51.504 --> 02:53.971
so that he can use the Shears of Destiny

02:54.006 --> 02:56.554
to cut our son's ties to his fate.

02:56.579 --> 02:59.042
And then, when that happens,

02:59.078 --> 03:00.344
he can take him from me,

03:00.379 --> 03:02.246
he can corrupt him, or even worse.

03:02.281 --> 03:04.047
Hook: If that truly is his plan,

03:04.083 --> 03:06.517
then why would he
announce it to us? [Scoffs]

03:06.552 --> 03:08.752
Because he wants me to
know what he's doing.

03:08.787 --> 03:11.321
He's trying to scare me so
that I'll go back to him,

03:11.357 --> 03:15.192
which I won't do, I can't do.

03:15.227 --> 03:17.294
There has to be a way to stop him.

03:19.265 --> 03:21.331
[Door opens]

03:21.367 --> 03:23.100
Belle: Rumplestiltskin, you're back.

03:23.135 --> 03:24.401
I, uh... I did the wash,

03:24.436 --> 03:26.603
and I polished the
silver like you asked.

03:26.639 --> 03:28.238
Good. Now you can take care of this.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.373
[Baby cries]

03:30.643 --> 03:32.509
A baby? [Exhales sharply]

03:32.545 --> 03:34.745
But where... where did it come from?

03:34.780 --> 03:37.147
What... where are its parents?

03:37.183 --> 03:38.415
They no longer matter.

03:38.450 --> 03:40.217
The child's mine now.

03:40.252 --> 03:41.385
[Crying continues]

03:41.420 --> 03:43.353
Y-yours?

03:43.389 --> 03:45.689
What you... you stole him?

03:45.724 --> 03:48.192
Yes. Scandalous, isn't it?

03:48.227 --> 03:49.760
Shh.

03:50.262 --> 03:52.262
It's okay. Shh.

03:52.298 --> 03:53.997
Oh, shh.

03:54.033 --> 03:57.208
What kind of beast steals
a child from its parents?

03:57.841 --> 03:59.105
I mean... [Sighs]

03:59.130 --> 04:01.833
What happened to you
that made you like this?

04:01.858 --> 04:04.441
You'd do best to stop
asking so many questions.

04:04.476 --> 04:06.343
Ahh, there it is.

04:06.378 --> 04:08.412
I have work to do.

04:08.447 --> 04:10.280
I'm not to be disturbed.

04:10.573 --> 04:13.006
Well, at least tell me his
name so I can soothe him.

04:14.710 --> 04:16.853
Or did you not even bother to find out?

04:16.889 --> 04:18.589
Why would I?

04:18.624 --> 04:20.190
A name's a special thing.

04:20.553 --> 04:21.685
You don't waste it

04:21.906 --> 04:24.240
on something you've no
intention of becoming...

04:25.531 --> 04:26.630
a-attached to.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.866
What do you mean?

04:32.152 --> 04:34.768
What do you plan on
doing with this child?

04:34.800 --> 04:36.413
I shall be back at sundown.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.976
Don't think about trying to hide it.

04:39.475 --> 04:41.041
I'll find out.

04:41.066 --> 04:42.279
- [Inhales deeply]
- Ah!

04:50.000 --> 04:53.056
Goldman's "Treatise on
the Metaphysics of Magic."

04:53.092 --> 04:55.692
Talbot's "The White Sorcerer's Way."

04:55.728 --> 04:57.127
What's this?

04:57.162 --> 05:02.432
Hildrew's "Manual on
Defeating the Dark One."

05:02.468 --> 05:04.868
Huh. I've never seen you before.

05:10.886 --> 05:14.287
"Follow the strand."

05:14.713 --> 05:17.848
The strand of what?

06:11.773 --> 06:13.973
I'm in the dream world again.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.264
Son: Our dream world.

06:16.742 --> 06:17.774
Hello, Mother.

06:20.257 --> 06:21.256
My son.

06:21.906 --> 06:23.950
[Chuckles] It's really you again.

06:26.518 --> 06:27.818
[Exhales deeply]

06:27.853 --> 06:30.087
Yes. I've come to warn you.

06:30.723 --> 06:33.523
The glowing thread you followed
is the strand of my fate.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.059
It's what my father plans
to cut with these shears

06:36.095 --> 06:37.760
as soon as I'm born.

06:38.221 --> 06:41.631
I-I'm trying to stop
him, but I don't know how.

06:41.667 --> 06:44.267
You know the answer to saving
me is already inside you.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.036
It's right here in front of you.

06:46.071 --> 06:48.171
You just have to be willing to see it.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.240
And do so quickly,

06:50.275 --> 06:53.276
or any hope of protecting
me will be cut short.

06:53.312 --> 06:54.911
Just like my fate.

07:03.942 --> 07:05.166
Look at these grades.

07:06.235 --> 07:08.201
I think they're finally getting it.

07:12.055 --> 07:13.088
Is something wrong?

07:13.123 --> 07:15.123
I feel silly saying anything

07:15.158 --> 07:17.482
- with all you're going through.
- No. It's okay.

07:17.507 --> 07:18.640
We're friends.

07:20.163 --> 07:21.997
Aladdin.

07:22.032 --> 07:25.500
He might have found something
to help locate Agrabah.

07:25.535 --> 07:26.568
A genie lamp.

07:26.603 --> 07:28.291
I don't know how much
you know about it...

07:28.316 --> 07:30.388
I know a little bit. My
father found one once.

07:30.413 --> 07:33.348
Then you know how
unpredictable genies can be,

07:33.677 --> 07:36.211
how all their wishes come with a price.

07:36.246 --> 07:39.281
And you're worried about
what the price could be

07:39.316 --> 07:41.283
if you wish to find Agrabah.

07:42.432 --> 07:43.785
What am I to do?

07:43.820 --> 07:45.548
Don't you remember the story you told me

07:45.573 --> 07:46.705
the first day we met?

07:47.124 --> 07:49.674
About the princess who didn't embrace

07:49.699 --> 07:52.266
being the hero she was meant to be?

07:52.301 --> 07:55.369
- You mean the story about me?
- Yes, I do.

07:55.404 --> 07:57.605
It is never too late
to be a hero, Jasmine.

07:58.132 --> 08:00.366
This might be your chance.

08:03.350 --> 08:04.192
So, in my dream,

08:04.217 --> 08:06.021
my son said that the
answer to stopping Rumple

08:06.046 --> 08:07.312
was right in front of me.

08:07.377 --> 08:08.678
Didn't say where.

08:08.703 --> 08:10.436
And this is the book you were reading?

08:10.461 --> 08:11.727
Yeah.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.835
Yeah, I don't think a spell
for the removal of hair

08:14.854 --> 08:15.953
is going to help us.

08:15.989 --> 08:18.522
It's not the spell
that's gonna do it, Swan.

08:18.558 --> 08:19.857
It's the book itself.

08:19.892 --> 08:21.392
Or, rather, the ink it's written in.

08:21.427 --> 08:22.727
I'd be a poor excuse for a pirate

08:22.762 --> 08:25.096
if I didn't recognize
squid ink when I saw it.

08:25.838 --> 08:27.431
Squid ink.

08:27.467 --> 08:29.734
- It can stun Rumple.
- Aye.

08:29.769 --> 08:30.768
And while he's held,

08:30.803 --> 08:32.470
we can take the shears from him.

08:32.505 --> 08:34.371
Okay, I can use my magic
to extract the squid ink.

08:34.407 --> 08:35.905
The question is... how do we dose him?

08:35.942 --> 08:36.907
I can do it.

08:37.246 --> 08:38.527
He's doing all of this

08:38.552 --> 08:40.249
because he thinks it'll
force me back to him,

08:40.274 --> 08:41.717
and if that's what he wants,

08:41.741 --> 08:43.573
then that's what I'm gonna
make him think I'm doing.

08:43.597 --> 08:44.661
Sorry, Belle, but no.

08:44.686 --> 08:45.816
It just gives Gold an opportunity

08:45.852 --> 08:47.847
to use his magic to
speed up your pregnancy.

08:47.872 --> 08:49.371
Hook: She's right, love.

08:49.396 --> 08:50.762
Your dream got us this far.

08:51.223 --> 08:53.056
You just have to leave the rest to us.

08:55.895 --> 08:58.162
"but Gideon was unafraid.

08:58.197 --> 08:59.530
He drew his sword

08:59.565 --> 09:02.366
and turned to face the evil Sorcerer,

09:02.402 --> 09:04.769
ready to save the people he loved."

09:04.804 --> 09:07.338
[Baby coos]

09:07.380 --> 09:09.814
You really like this, don't you?

09:09.842 --> 09:11.842
So did I, when I was little.

09:11.878 --> 09:15.046
This is the first book that
my mother ever read to me.

09:18.077 --> 09:20.405
I used to tell her that when I grew up,

09:20.430 --> 09:23.309
I was going to be a strong, brave hero,

09:23.334 --> 09:26.402
just like Gideon in the book.

09:26.492 --> 09:30.494
Maybe you could grow up
to be like him someday.

09:30.530 --> 09:31.896
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

09:33.930 --> 09:36.667
Of course, you'll only get the chance to

09:36.702 --> 09:39.804
if we can figure out what
Rumplestiltskin is planning

09:39.839 --> 09:43.574
before the sun goes down
and he takes you away,

09:43.609 --> 09:48.479
which, now that I've calmed you down,

09:48.514 --> 09:49.947
maybe we can do that.

09:57.223 --> 09:58.422
Knock, knock.

09:59.284 --> 10:01.320
Ooh! Look who it is!

10:01.353 --> 10:02.560
Your Evil Auntie!

10:03.381 --> 10:04.637
Would you like to hold her?

10:04.662 --> 10:05.930
I think she misses you.

10:05.965 --> 10:08.999
Oh, no. That's okay.

10:09.035 --> 10:11.535
In fact, I was hoping to
catch you during nap time.

10:11.571 --> 10:12.937
Why's that?

10:12.972 --> 10:14.138
Why are you here?

10:14.782 --> 10:16.640
Gold sent me.

10:22.615 --> 10:23.981
So, what now?

10:24.016 --> 10:25.483
Hmm?

10:25.744 --> 10:28.044
Oh, I suggest you put the baby down.

10:35.695 --> 10:37.328
Mommy loves you.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.467
[Sighs]

10:47.140 --> 10:49.173
So, this is it.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.242
How about we take this outside?

10:56.782 --> 10:58.015
Enough games.

10:58.952 --> 11:00.050
Let's end this.

11:05.625 --> 11:06.757
[Groans]

11:06.792 --> 11:09.693
Looks like evil <i>does</i> beat wicked.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.287
Goodbye, sis.

11:13.900 --> 11:14.765
[Grunts]

11:14.800 --> 11:16.634
[Groans]

11:16.669 --> 11:17.801
No.

11:17.837 --> 11:19.003
[Heart beating]

11:19.038 --> 11:20.437
My heart.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.640
Regina: Not <i> your</i> heart.

11:22.675 --> 11:24.308
<i>Mine.</i>

11:26.243 --> 11:27.809
Regina.

11:29.716 --> 11:31.515
You can't control me with that?

11:31.551 --> 11:32.735
Oh, I don't have to.

11:32.798 --> 11:35.052
All I have to do is crush it.

11:35.087 --> 11:36.887
You wouldn't.

11:36.923 --> 11:38.622
Not for her.

11:38.658 --> 11:40.591
Really?

11:40.626 --> 11:42.826
Let's find out.

11:42.862 --> 11:44.428
[Gasps]

11:46.165 --> 11:47.264
[Groans]

11:47.300 --> 11:50.968
[Beating continues]

11:53.272 --> 11:56.640
So, now that you know I'm serious,

11:56.676 --> 11:59.577
you're going to tell
me why you'd do this.

11:59.612 --> 12:01.245
Zelena: It was Rumplestiltskin.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.180
He said it was either me or him.

12:05.622 --> 12:07.084
Did he now?

12:07.119 --> 12:09.053
Oh, you're just jealous!

12:09.088 --> 12:11.121
You think he cares for you?

12:11.157 --> 12:12.150
Don't you get it?

12:12.175 --> 12:13.221
He lied to you

12:13.246 --> 12:16.247
because he knew your
revenge wasn't enough.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.904
You still have a hole in your heart,

12:21.423 --> 12:24.235
just like I did when I first came here.

12:24.270 --> 12:27.215
You don't know what
you're talking about.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.157
And you're so desperate to fill it,

12:29.182 --> 12:31.037
you actually believed him.

12:31.377 --> 12:33.042
- You're wrong!
- Am I?

12:33.370 --> 12:35.412
Go ask him and find out.

12:35.448 --> 12:39.917
After all, we're done with you here.

12:45.391 --> 12:47.258
[Sighs]

12:49.996 --> 12:51.595
[Doorbell rings]

12:51.631 --> 12:53.430
Oh, look who it is.

12:53.466 --> 12:55.799
The Savior's lap dog.

12:55.835 --> 12:58.269
Come to pick out a new collar, have we?

12:58.304 --> 12:59.882
Actually, I've come to try and stop you

12:59.907 --> 13:01.972
from ruining another
one of your son's lives,

13:02.008 --> 13:04.479
- just like you did with Bae.
- [Scoffs]

13:05.054 --> 13:06.887
Is that a fact?

13:06.912 --> 13:09.513
What made you think it was a
good idea to provoke the Dark One?

13:09.548 --> 13:10.781
[Gasps]

13:13.802 --> 13:15.371
It's called a distraction.

13:15.554 --> 13:16.887
Killian... I'm all right.

13:17.990 --> 13:19.790
Let's get searching.

13:20.460 --> 13:23.394
I'll remember this, Pirate.

13:23.429 --> 13:25.095
He's not carrying the
dagger or the shears.

13:25.131 --> 13:26.163
Okay.

13:26.198 --> 13:27.831
You look up here. I'll
search in the back.

13:32.138 --> 13:33.671
[Sighs]

13:36.208 --> 13:37.374
[Gasps]

13:40.446 --> 13:41.312
[Exhales sharply]

13:41.347 --> 13:42.813
Emma?

13:51.659 --> 13:53.420
Are you okay? What happened?

13:53.445 --> 13:54.978
I saw another vision.

13:55.003 --> 13:56.560
Well, I thought those had stopped.

13:56.595 --> 13:57.594
Me, too.

13:57.630 --> 13:58.829
Against Hyde.

13:58.864 --> 14:00.497
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:00.533 --> 14:02.696
- Are you okay?
- [Panting]

14:02.975 --> 14:04.455
I...

14:04.480 --> 14:05.979
I don't know.

14:34.335 --> 14:35.618
No. No, no.

14:35.643 --> 14:37.174
How did you...

14:37.219 --> 14:42.155
You really think dried
squid ink can hold me?

14:42.443 --> 14:44.409
I'm far too powerful for that now.

14:44.445 --> 14:49.548
Look, I know you want me back, Rumple.

14:49.583 --> 14:52.522
It's... it's never gonna happen.

14:53.131 --> 14:55.354
I know.

14:55.389 --> 14:59.057
But I cannot lose another son, Belle.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.598
I won't.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.183
Not if I can stop it.

15:09.236 --> 15:10.302
No.

15:11.539 --> 15:12.971
No.

15:32.693 --> 15:34.293
- [Baby coos]
- All right.

15:38.456 --> 15:40.723
This is fairy language.

15:46.474 --> 15:48.540
It's an incantation

15:48.565 --> 15:51.766
for someone called...

15:51.791 --> 15:54.192
The Black Fairy.

15:56.263 --> 15:58.207
But what would
Rumplestiltskin want from her,

15:58.232 --> 16:00.999
and what does that have
to do with why he took you?

16:01.035 --> 16:01.924
[Baby cries]

16:01.949 --> 16:03.916
- That's for me to know...
- [Gasps]

16:04.204 --> 16:06.805
And you never to find out.

16:07.641 --> 16:08.807
No.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.556
You knew I was going to do this.

16:10.581 --> 16:11.837
Not only did I know.

16:11.862 --> 16:13.920
I was planning on it.

16:14.150 --> 16:15.283
You really think

16:15.318 --> 16:18.419
I left the tower door open by accident?

16:19.456 --> 16:21.322
I don't speak fairy.

16:21.358 --> 16:23.758
But why do I need to when I have you?

16:23.793 --> 16:26.427
No. I will not let you hurt this baby.

16:28.413 --> 16:29.273
[Gasps]

16:29.298 --> 16:30.998
The child is no longer your concern.

16:32.769 --> 16:36.170
I think you should
stay here for a while.

16:36.206 --> 16:39.507
Don't want you getting any
ideas about trying to stop me.

16:48.885 --> 16:49.617
No.

16:51.221 --> 16:52.954
[Grunts]

17:02.198 --> 17:03.164
[Sighs]

17:03.199 --> 17:06.400
Why... why are you doing this?

17:06.425 --> 17:08.440
After all this time, you must know.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.573
I will never be the
man you think I can be.

17:12.608 --> 17:14.876
It... it doesn't have to be like that.

17:14.911 --> 17:15.977
I'm afraid it does.

17:17.646 --> 17:19.814
When we met,

17:19.848 --> 17:23.550
I told you I was a
difficult man to love.

17:23.586 --> 17:26.454
But more than that, I think...

17:29.526 --> 17:32.026
I think I'm a man no one can love.

17:35.198 --> 17:37.432
But this son,

17:37.467 --> 17:41.569
with him, I can start over.

17:41.604 --> 17:46.140
Maybe <i> he</i> can love me.

17:48.011 --> 17:50.411
Not like this.

17:51.131 --> 17:53.247
Don't give up, Rumple.

17:53.283 --> 17:56.384
I... I never wanted you to be perfect.

17:56.419 --> 17:58.519
I just wanted you to try.

17:58.555 --> 18:00.154
I have.

18:00.190 --> 18:01.422
And look what's happened.

18:01.465 --> 18:02.286
[Sighs]

18:02.311 --> 18:04.809
I've only ever pushed you away.

18:07.184 --> 18:08.763
Now, uh...

18:08.798 --> 18:12.033
I-I'm afraid all I really have...

18:14.237 --> 18:15.837
is this.

18:16.969 --> 18:18.806
Magic.

18:20.176 --> 18:22.810
And it may get you your son.

18:23.469 --> 18:26.180
You know there's a price.

18:26.216 --> 18:30.585
You won't just push me away again.

18:33.132 --> 18:36.000
You'll lose me forever.

18:36.903 --> 18:41.396
Is that a price that
you're willing to pay?

18:53.194 --> 18:54.721
All right, hold still.

19:03.841 --> 19:05.841
[Exhales sharply] Thank you.

19:06.581 --> 19:07.781
After a scrap like that,

19:07.824 --> 19:09.627
I don't think I could
magic a glass of warm milk,

19:09.652 --> 19:11.351
let alone heal myself.

19:14.323 --> 19:16.087
I'm lucky you happened by.

19:16.991 --> 19:18.785
Yeah, about that...

19:18.810 --> 19:20.935
No. Listen, let me...

19:20.971 --> 19:23.371
let me go first.

19:23.417 --> 19:25.417
I should have been the one

19:25.442 --> 19:28.310
to reach out and find you, to apologize.

19:28.345 --> 19:31.079
- It's...
- I didn't come here to apologize.

19:32.568 --> 19:37.229
Truth is, I thought
I'd find some magic here

19:37.254 --> 19:40.188
to help reverse an
aging spell Gold used.

19:40.224 --> 19:42.324
You mean you came here to steal from me?

19:42.359 --> 19:46.294
Well, what I supposed
to think you'd share?

19:46.330 --> 19:48.530
After everything you
did to me and my friends?

19:48.565 --> 19:49.828
Well, if that's what you assumed,

19:49.853 --> 19:51.466
why even bother saving me, then?

19:51.502 --> 19:53.710
Because that's what heroes do, Zelena.

19:53.745 --> 19:55.245
They save people.

19:55.280 --> 19:58.048
- [Laughs]
- Even the people who have hurt them

19:58.083 --> 20:02.719
in... unimaginable ways.

20:03.559 --> 20:07.123
So this is about Robin Hood.

20:07.159 --> 20:09.561
You still blame me for his death.

20:09.586 --> 20:11.219
Yes, that's exactly right.

20:11.463 --> 20:12.762
What about forgiveness?

20:12.798 --> 20:14.898
What about redemption?

20:14.933 --> 20:16.199
I mean, you've been forgiven!

20:16.235 --> 20:17.400
You've grown.

20:17.436 --> 20:19.369
You've changed!

20:20.439 --> 20:21.872
You're not me.

20:23.673 --> 20:25.940
I can never forgive you.

20:26.468 --> 20:28.370
I can pity you.

20:28.450 --> 20:30.650
I can hate you.

20:30.983 --> 20:33.416
I can spare your life.

20:35.672 --> 20:38.221
But I can never forgive you.

20:48.033 --> 20:49.266
You ready?

20:49.301 --> 20:50.600
[Breathes deeply]

20:50.636 --> 20:51.927
I am.

21:06.944 --> 21:08.243
[Mental clanks]

21:11.436 --> 21:13.548
I don't understand.

21:13.584 --> 21:15.250
Where's the genie?

21:15.285 --> 21:16.426
He's been freed.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.533
But without a genie,

21:18.693 --> 21:21.498
I can't use a wish to
get back to Agrabah.

21:28.073 --> 21:30.473
Actually, I think you will.

21:31.575 --> 21:32.941
What are you doing?

21:32.970 --> 21:34.577
You'll be a prisoner of the lamp.

21:34.613 --> 21:35.779
It's not such a bad life.

21:35.814 --> 21:37.580
Sure, some genies are insufferable,

21:37.616 --> 21:39.749
but I knew a pretty great one once.

21:39.785 --> 21:42.218
And he's been free
for a while now, so...

21:42.254 --> 21:43.987
Maybe I can be like him.

21:45.290 --> 21:46.790
Hey, hey.

21:51.596 --> 21:53.897
Either way...

21:54.244 --> 21:56.344
let's say we find out.

22:05.811 --> 22:07.844
Evil Queen: You didn't use it.

22:09.389 --> 22:11.681
So Regina was right then.

22:11.717 --> 22:13.984
You were just using me
to get rid of Zelena.

22:14.019 --> 22:16.252
If you've come here
looking for retribution,

22:16.288 --> 22:18.221
you've come to the wrong place.

22:18.256 --> 22:20.123
Oh, let me guess why

22:20.158 --> 22:21.925
you didn't use the magic on Belle.

22:21.960 --> 22:26.429
She gave you some speech
about "the man in the beast,"

22:26.465 --> 22:28.565
or whatever she claims to see in you.

22:30.235 --> 22:34.404
Even if you were the person
she wants you to be today,

22:34.439 --> 22:37.090
how long will that really last?

22:38.111 --> 22:39.711
Soon enough, she'll realize,

22:39.911 --> 22:42.479
as she always does,

22:42.514 --> 22:45.849
that's not who you really are.

22:46.629 --> 22:48.418
But this time,

22:49.493 --> 22:52.905
she'll have a child to protect.

22:52.967 --> 22:55.859
And she'll do what she should have

22:55.894 --> 22:59.129
way back when.

22:59.164 --> 23:02.832
She'll go and take the boy with her.

23:03.769 --> 23:07.237
[Laughing] And you'll be alone,

23:07.272 --> 23:11.526
just as it was the first time.

23:11.551 --> 23:13.309
With Baelfire.

23:16.348 --> 23:19.741
You want to know what
failure looks like?

23:19.776 --> 23:21.376
Take a look in the mirror.

23:23.733 --> 23:26.723
Do not dare question me again.

23:26.758 --> 23:28.491
Now go.

23:28.527 --> 23:29.926
We're done.

23:40.272 --> 23:41.438
[Knocking]

23:41.473 --> 23:42.472
[Grunts]

23:42.507 --> 23:45.742
[Pounding on door]

23:50.315 --> 23:52.015
Hello?

23:52.050 --> 23:54.417
Hello? Is someone out there?

23:54.453 --> 23:56.953
Please, I... I need help!

23:56.988 --> 23:58.822
Hello?

23:58.890 --> 23:59.756
I...

24:00.172 --> 24:01.271
Hello?

24:06.698 --> 24:09.032
You're a... a fairy.

24:09.067 --> 24:11.301
[Panting] I'm Blue.

24:11.336 --> 24:12.502
And by the looks of things,

24:12.537 --> 24:14.637
you're another soul held
captive by the Dark One.

24:14.673 --> 24:16.973
Yeah, and... and I need
you to get me out of here.

24:17.008 --> 24:19.309
Rumplestiltskin has a
child who's in great danger.

24:19.344 --> 24:20.743
I know. That's why I'm here.

24:20.779 --> 24:21.878
I came as soon as I sensed

24:21.913 --> 24:23.313
the fairy incantations being read.

24:23.348 --> 24:24.414
We have to stop him

24:24.449 --> 24:25.982
before he can use it to
summon The Black Fairy.

24:26.017 --> 24:27.951
Why? I thought that
all fairies were good.

24:27.986 --> 24:30.854
Well, she used to be good once.

24:30.889 --> 24:32.555
- What happened?
- [Sighs]

24:32.591 --> 24:33.790
No one knows exactly.

24:33.825 --> 24:35.758
Just that her heart blackened

24:35.794 --> 24:37.382
and she stopped defending the children

24:37.407 --> 24:39.062
that she was meant to protect.

24:39.097 --> 24:41.231
She started stealing them instead.

24:41.266 --> 24:44.067
Which means that that
child is in grave danger.

24:44.102 --> 24:45.802
Rumple is trying to use it to lure her.

24:45.837 --> 24:47.137
But why?

24:47.172 --> 24:48.805
What could possibly be so important

24:48.840 --> 24:49.873
that he'd want from her?

24:50.266 --> 24:51.398
I wish I knew.

24:51.604 --> 24:53.109
But, right now, we just
need to get you free

24:53.145 --> 24:54.711
so that you can save that child.

24:54.746 --> 24:56.646
What? Me?

24:56.681 --> 24:58.548
But I... I don't have magic.

24:58.583 --> 25:01.217
Well, that's precisely
why it has to be you.

25:01.253 --> 25:02.719
My magic can't save him.

25:08.293 --> 25:10.326
Hurry! There's not much time.

25:10.362 --> 25:11.895
Wish me luck.

25:11.930 --> 25:13.596
I'm going to need it.

25:15.827 --> 25:17.800
I... I know I should be relieved...

25:17.836 --> 25:20.770
Well, no one's gonna blame
you for still worrying.

25:20.805 --> 25:21.727
Gold did the right thing today.

25:21.752 --> 25:23.106
That doesn't mean he'll
do the same tomorrow.

25:23.141 --> 25:24.607
Emma's right.

25:24.643 --> 25:26.571
And we have to make sure that
he can't use that magic on you,

25:26.596 --> 25:27.762
and we will.

25:27.787 --> 25:30.320
Here you go. One cup of chamomile.

25:30.482 --> 25:32.081
It soothes the soul.

25:32.405 --> 25:34.572
- Thanks, Granny.
- Aye, love.

25:34.717 --> 25:37.284
Drink up. Helps calm the nerves.

25:38.089 --> 25:39.288
Excuse us, love.

25:40.859 --> 25:44.037
So, are you gonna tell me
what happened back at Gold's,

25:44.062 --> 25:45.495
or do I have to guess?

25:46.393 --> 25:48.064
I saw my death again.

25:49.034 --> 25:52.535
It was the same
details, the same figure.

25:52.571 --> 25:54.704
Everything was the same.

25:54.739 --> 25:57.974
Except this time,
there was something new.

25:58.009 --> 26:02.712
The sword... the sword
that's used to kill me, I...

26:02.747 --> 26:06.149
It had a red jewel on
the bottom of the handle,

26:06.184 --> 26:07.483
almost glowing.

26:07.519 --> 26:09.085
What brought the vision on?

26:09.120 --> 26:09.908
I don't know.

26:09.933 --> 26:11.533
Maybe just being in the shop?

26:12.257 --> 26:13.823
Maybe there was something in there.

26:13.858 --> 26:15.892
- [Glass shatters]
- Belle: [Groans]

26:15.927 --> 26:16.793
Belle?

26:16.828 --> 26:18.094
What is it? Are you okay?

26:18.129 --> 26:20.129
The tea.

26:20.165 --> 26:21.631
[Gasps]

26:21.866 --> 26:23.032
Aah! No!

26:23.068 --> 26:24.200
No. No. This can't...

26:24.236 --> 26:26.135
This can't be happening!

26:26.775 --> 26:28.438
Please, no!

26:29.304 --> 26:31.374
[Gasps]

26:31.409 --> 26:33.009
No!

26:36.347 --> 26:39.281
[Baby cries]

26:41.586 --> 26:43.886
Let the night sky tremble,

26:43.921 --> 26:46.422
as the Dark Star shall fall.

26:47.137 --> 26:49.692
Awake, Black Fairy,

26:49.727 --> 26:51.827
and heed my call.

27:07.979 --> 27:10.646
[Crying continues]

27:13.590 --> 27:16.079
Rumplestiltskin: I'm afraid I can't
let you get ahold of that baby.

27:17.532 --> 27:19.021
Not yet, anyway.

27:19.056 --> 27:21.290
Who dares summon me?

27:23.527 --> 27:24.560
Squid ink.

27:25.805 --> 27:26.971
Nasty stuff.

27:29.345 --> 27:32.067
Rumplestiltskin.

27:32.103 --> 27:34.889
So you know who I am.

27:34.914 --> 27:38.882
Oh, who hasn't heard of the Dark One?

27:39.010 --> 27:40.294
And if you've heard of me,

27:40.319 --> 27:42.786
you know that squid
ink won't hold me long.

27:42.850 --> 27:44.416
Oh, I know.

27:44.452 --> 27:46.385
That's why...

27:46.420 --> 27:47.653
I have this.

27:48.322 --> 27:51.490
And how exactly do
you plan on using that?

27:52.059 --> 27:53.259
Well, that all depends on

27:53.294 --> 27:56.328
how you answer one simple question.

27:56.364 --> 27:59.331
You steal babies.

27:59.367 --> 28:01.774
Steal them from their mothers' arms.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.874
So, why, of all the babies,
in all of the realms,

28:06.422 --> 28:09.542
why did you abandon the one child

28:10.626 --> 28:13.879
who was actually yours?

28:16.684 --> 28:17.817
No.

28:19.086 --> 28:20.219
No.

28:21.455 --> 28:23.289
It can't be.

28:24.290 --> 28:27.560
Oh, I'm afraid it can be...

28:27.595 --> 28:28.794
Mother.

28:30.865 --> 28:33.399
That's right.

28:33.434 --> 28:38.571
Rumplestiltskin is your son.

28:38.606 --> 28:40.873
Of course, you would know that...

28:42.710 --> 28:45.544
Had you bothered to even give me a name.

28:50.119 --> 28:52.253
And now you are gonna
answer my question.

28:54.333 --> 28:56.000
Why did you abandon me?

28:59.393 --> 29:01.093
[Laughs]

29:02.263 --> 29:05.965
Funny that the Dark One
should ask such a thing.

29:06.242 --> 29:10.644
Sometimes you have to
choose power over love.

29:12.842 --> 29:14.475
[Crying continues]

29:16.149 --> 29:17.689
- [Grunts]
- Time's up.

29:17.714 --> 29:18.783
[Gasps]

29:18.808 --> 29:22.142
No more answers for you today.

29:22.717 --> 29:25.584
Guess you'll just have
to keep on wondering.

29:25.620 --> 29:26.518
[Laughs]

29:26.554 --> 29:27.653
Son!

29:28.522 --> 29:30.522
[Laughs]

29:41.202 --> 29:42.534
I understand now.

29:42.570 --> 29:45.731
I mean, you didn't deserve what she did.

29:45.756 --> 29:48.084
But sacrificing the
life of an innocent child

29:48.109 --> 29:49.909
is not the answer.

29:49.944 --> 29:52.578
No matter how much pain you're in.

29:56.017 --> 30:00.920
No one knows anything about my pain.

30:09.497 --> 30:13.432
I should have known The Savior
would bring my wife here.

30:13.467 --> 30:16.035
Wherever there's injustice in the world,

30:16.070 --> 30:18.604
there's always a fairy.

30:30.985 --> 30:32.718
Fairy magic.

30:49.437 --> 30:52.371
[Heart beating]

31:05.950 --> 31:08.336
Boy: Can you push me
on the swing, Mommy?

31:10.024 --> 31:11.557
[Exhales deeply]

31:11.592 --> 31:13.058
I was...

31:13.094 --> 31:15.761
I was afraid I wouldn't
be able to find you.

31:16.879 --> 31:19.765
You'll always find me when you need to.

31:19.800 --> 31:20.766
[Chuckles]

31:25.306 --> 31:26.305
Belle: So, look.

31:26.340 --> 31:28.273
We don't have much time now, okay?

31:28.309 --> 31:32.144
Your father's coming, and
he will use those shears.

31:32.179 --> 31:34.880
So, please, if you know how to stop him,

31:34.915 --> 31:36.375
you have to let me know.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.367
You know what you must do.

31:41.956 --> 31:44.056
No.

31:44.504 --> 31:45.503
No.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.526
No. No. I can't.

31:47.561 --> 31:48.527
I won't.

31:48.562 --> 31:50.796
There has to be another way.

31:51.278 --> 31:52.765
There isn't.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.435
As you said, we're out of time.

32:02.848 --> 32:05.082
I love you.

32:05.212 --> 32:09.782
I love you more than
anything in the world.

32:10.751 --> 32:13.018
I know.

32:13.054 --> 32:14.897
And I won't ever forget it.

32:17.658 --> 32:21.326
- [Sniffles]
- Oh, and Mother...

32:21.362 --> 32:23.395
don't forget the book.

32:24.734 --> 32:26.141
What book?

32:26.767 --> 32:27.645
[Gasps]

32:29.904 --> 32:33.205
[Beating continues]

32:51.524 --> 32:53.490
- [Chuckles]
- [Laughs]

32:53.515 --> 32:55.448
Oh, congratulations.

32:55.473 --> 32:56.773
[Laughs]

32:56.798 --> 32:58.031
Thank you, Blue.

32:58.066 --> 33:00.433
They said you wanted to see me.

33:00.468 --> 33:02.705
Yeah.

33:02.730 --> 33:04.671
Yeah, I need your help.

33:05.127 --> 33:07.073
Of course. Anything.

33:07.108 --> 33:08.274
Here.

33:11.146 --> 33:13.379
Will you be his fairy godmother?

33:15.717 --> 33:18.451
And will you take him somewhere safe,

33:18.486 --> 33:22.055
somewhere far away from all this?

33:22.090 --> 33:23.523
Belle, what are you doing?

33:24.339 --> 33:25.369
Rumple will never stop.

33:25.401 --> 33:27.667
This is our son's only chance.

33:27.714 --> 33:29.595
Please take him,

33:29.631 --> 33:32.432
just until this is all over.

33:33.051 --> 33:37.403
But you don't know when or
if that will come to pass.

33:37.439 --> 33:38.771
I believe it will.

33:38.807 --> 33:40.940
I have to believe it will.

33:43.144 --> 33:45.345
Yeah.

33:45.380 --> 33:46.546
[Voice breaking] Take him.

33:47.716 --> 33:49.716
Of course.

33:49.751 --> 33:50.817
[Sniffles]

33:56.591 --> 33:57.857
Thank you, Blue.

34:00.313 --> 34:01.427
[Normal voice] There's,
uh... there's one more thing.

34:01.463 --> 34:02.462
Killian.

34:08.155 --> 34:10.136
Read it to him

34:10.170 --> 34:12.739
so that he knows that
I'm always there for him.

34:15.406 --> 34:17.034
My Gideon...

34:18.913 --> 34:21.963
strong and brave...

34:23.877 --> 34:26.257
a hero for all time.

34:34.795 --> 34:38.331
Don't you ever forget that I love you.

34:45.172 --> 34:46.906
[Cries]

34:50.045 --> 34:51.110
[Sniffles]

35:20.675 --> 35:21.974
No.

35:31.753 --> 35:34.053
You abandoned our son?

35:35.390 --> 35:36.823
After everything?

35:36.858 --> 35:40.093
[Scoffs] I didn't abandon him!

35:40.128 --> 35:43.096
I gave him his best
chance at a good life.

35:43.141 --> 35:44.345
And after what you did,

35:44.370 --> 35:47.500
that is clearly a
life without you in it.

35:48.470 --> 35:49.068
Belle...

35:49.104 --> 35:50.470
Rumple, no!

35:50.505 --> 35:51.637
It's over.

35:51.673 --> 35:52.790
Okay? It's over!

35:52.815 --> 35:56.016
There's nothing left for you to say.

35:58.913 --> 36:00.279
What's his name?

36:00.873 --> 36:01.848
[Scoffs]

36:03.084 --> 36:04.484
What's our son's name?

36:05.854 --> 36:07.954
Why?

36:07.989 --> 36:10.423
So you can use it to find him?

36:10.458 --> 36:13.942
You can do what you will with me,

36:13.967 --> 36:16.734
but I will never tell you.

36:17.442 --> 36:19.365
I would never hurt you, Belle.

36:21.836 --> 36:22.935
Never.

36:25.929 --> 36:28.455
But I will find our son.

36:35.988 --> 36:38.289
[Thunder rumbles]

37:06.514 --> 37:08.548
Evil Queen: Someone lose another son?

37:12.020 --> 37:14.320
Don't.

37:14.355 --> 37:15.224
Not now.

37:15.249 --> 37:17.883
Or what? Hmm?

37:18.457 --> 37:19.725
[Laughing] Oh.

37:19.761 --> 37:22.295
I bet Belle <i>really</i>
hates you now, huh?

37:24.532 --> 37:25.598
Go.

37:25.633 --> 37:26.519
No.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.011
I'm going to enjoy this.

37:29.170 --> 37:31.938
I went to a lot of trouble for this

37:31.973 --> 37:37.009
to see what happens when
you poison your love.

37:38.279 --> 37:40.580
I did no such thing.

37:41.783 --> 37:43.049
You did.

37:43.084 --> 37:44.317
[Laughing] Oh, no.

37:44.352 --> 37:45.551
<i>You</i> did.

37:45.979 --> 37:49.055
By making me an enemy.

37:49.090 --> 37:50.323
Okay, yes,

37:50.358 --> 37:52.959
I did the actual dosing of the tea

37:52.994 --> 37:56.362
after I stole your magic.

37:57.071 --> 37:59.699
But you forced my hand.

37:59.734 --> 38:01.100
Oh, worry not.

38:01.135 --> 38:03.302
It'll be easy to fix, no?

38:03.338 --> 38:05.137
Just tell her.

38:05.173 --> 38:07.340
Oh, wait.

38:07.375 --> 38:10.798
She won't believe you, will she?

38:10.823 --> 38:11.837
Tragic.

38:11.862 --> 38:15.087
I may not have crossed a line today.

38:17.051 --> 38:18.784
But you most certainly did.

38:20.488 --> 38:23.089
And I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.

38:23.124 --> 38:25.424
Oh, please.

38:25.460 --> 38:26.717
If you haven't found a way

38:26.742 --> 38:29.295
to kill the woman who
murdered your own son

38:29.330 --> 38:31.697
without enlisting my help,

38:31.733 --> 38:33.899
I'm not all that concerned.

38:34.618 --> 38:38.738
One thing I thought you knew
about me by now, Your Majesty...

38:40.441 --> 38:44.176
I play a very long game.

38:44.212 --> 38:45.745
And you?

38:45.780 --> 38:49.415
You're nothing more
than one of my pawns.

38:52.654 --> 38:55.354
Good luck finding your son.

38:55.390 --> 38:57.323
Again.

39:00.094 --> 39:03.396
I hear fairies make wonderful mothers.

39:27.021 --> 39:29.386
[Grunts]

39:32.683 --> 39:35.661
[Glass shatters]

39:40.401 --> 39:42.134
Good news. Regina called.

39:42.170 --> 39:43.769
She reversed the spell.

39:43.805 --> 39:44.996
That sister is gonna live

39:45.021 --> 39:47.355
a long and hopefully
far less eventful life.

39:47.475 --> 39:49.008
And what about Belle?

39:49.812 --> 39:52.411
As good as can be expected
after all she's been through.

39:52.447 --> 39:54.914
What she just did...

39:54.949 --> 39:56.482
that's why I keep fighting.

39:58.667 --> 40:00.553
As the Savior.

40:00.588 --> 40:02.822
It's a title I've thought about
running from numerous times,

40:02.857 --> 40:03.593
but I never have,

40:03.618 --> 40:06.730
and what she did today reminded me

40:06.755 --> 40:11.163
why I don't run, why I fight.

40:11.849 --> 40:14.100
Because I want to protect
my family and my friends

40:14.135 --> 40:17.870
and the people that I love.

40:19.474 --> 40:21.340
The vision... it's still getting to you.

40:21.376 --> 40:22.708
Yeah.

40:23.625 --> 40:25.978
It's time for me to get to it.

40:28.216 --> 40:30.983
There's the fight that I love.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.519
Let's go find out what
really happened to me.

40:42.130 --> 40:43.617
Emma: Whoa.

40:43.642 --> 40:45.464
Oh, well, someone had a temper tantrum.

40:45.500 --> 40:46.908
Hook: Do you really think
you'll find something in here

40:46.933 --> 40:48.199
to explain your vision?

40:51.869 --> 40:53.439
I think I just did.

40:53.708 --> 40:54.640
Emma: This is it.

40:54.675 --> 40:56.609
This is the sword from my vision.

40:58.713 --> 40:59.845
It's here.

41:08.656 --> 41:10.423
Emma, are you okay?

41:10.458 --> 41:11.957
[Panting]

41:13.261 --> 41:14.326
Yeah.

41:14.362 --> 41:16.986
I think it's safe to
say this is what did it.

41:17.104 --> 41:18.497
This is the sword that killed you.

41:18.533 --> 41:20.099
<i>Will</i> kill me.

41:20.134 --> 41:22.307
- And why would it be in here?
- I don't know.

41:22.332 --> 41:23.252
But now that we have it,

41:23.277 --> 41:25.711
maybe we can finally
find who's responsible.

41:26.215 --> 41:28.081
The figure under the hood.

41:28.594 --> 41:29.796
Yeah.
