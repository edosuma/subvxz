You're the one who made it clear

00:09.993 --> 00:11.677
that not having kids was
a deal-breaker.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.403
Kit Voss offered me a job.

00:13.405 --> 00:15.330

We're gonna live it up, Nic.

01:03.289 --> 01:04.454

01:04.456 --> 01:06.214
It's our first night out

a little separation anxiety.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.736
You have nothing to worry about.

01:10.738 --> 01:11.904

And I will test it just
to make sure it's not too hot.

-Great, and don't forget to
burp her and change her after.
-MARION: Of course.

does that also make you

-to ask for some leaves
for dinner.
-Silly.

I had one life to live,

What she has is
post-viral myocarditis.

It is by far the best chance

that we can try.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.654
What is this option?

19:16.656 --> 19:21.492
Well, we could put Trini
on a machine called an ECMO.

19:21.494 --> 19:24.162
It would ease the stress
of her struggling heart,

19:24.164 --> 19:27.556

19:33.564 --> 19:36.674
-Do it.
-No, it is far from perfect.

19:36.676 --> 19:38.859
You have to understand
that ECMO is very dangerous.

Unable to speak. Blind.

DEVON:
And she could die
from any of these complications.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.933
Then the baby would die as well.

19:53.935 --> 19:55.751
But there's a chance

19:55.753 --> 19:58.421
that Trini and the baby could
both be fine with this ECMO?

sacrifice his wife's
best chance to live

-That's terrible.
-Yes.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.801
But it made me realize
something about myself.

34:39.803 --> 34:43.638
That I'm doing the same thing,
choosing a hypothetical child
