01:11.881 --> 01:13.877
<i>from the Royal Amsterdam</i>
<i>Orche--</i>

01:16.118 --> 01:17.948
<i>Are you picking up some food?</i>

01:19.548 --> 01:21.087
<i>Boxing Day on one</i>

01:21.122 --> 01:23.181

Treasure of the Sierra Madre.
<i>That's in half an hour.</i>

01:26.028 --> 01:28.229
<i>But first, on</i>
London Thames Tonight,

01:28.264 --> 01:31.423
<i>we join</i>
<i>Adie Bruce for your</i>
<i>Christmas Day news.</i>

01:39.535 --> 01:41.702
<i>Today,</i>
<i>Mikhail Gorbachev resigned</i>

01:41.737 --> 01:44.311
<i>as the last president</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union.</i>

01:44.346 --> 01:47.842
<i>The red flag of communism</i>
<i>lowered over the Kremlin,</i>

01:47.878 --> 01:50.516
<i>bringing to an end</i>
<i>seven decades of</i>
<i>the party's rule.</i>

01:50.551 --> 01:54.185
<i>Right to the last,</i>
<i>Mr. Gorbachev conveyed</i>
<i>his unhappiness</i>

01:54.220 --> 01:56.179
<i>at the break</i>
<i>of the Soviet Union.</i>

01:56.215 --> 01:58.553
<i>After six and a half</i>
<i>years in power,</i>

01:58.588 --> 02:01.219
Gorbachev announces
his resignation today

02:03.056 --> 02:05.666
<i> No doubt</i>
<i>it may have been possible</i>

02:05.701 --> 02:07.627
<i>to avoid many mistakes.</i>

02:07.662 --> 02:09.966
<i>To have done much</i>
<i>in a better way.</i>

02:10.001 --> 02:11.164
<i>But I'm sure...</i>

02:11.200 --> 02:13.305
All right, okay.

02:13.340 --> 02:16.676
<i>...our common joint efforts</i>
<i>will yield fruit</i>

02:16.711 --> 02:22.108
<i>and our people</i>
<i>will live in a prosperous</i>
<i>and democratic society.</i>

02:22.143 --> 02:23.676
Go on.

02:23.711 --> 02:26.547
<i>I wish all of you</i>
<i>all the best.</i>

02:26.582 --> 02:28.781
<i>1992 will now ring in</i>

02:28.816 --> 02:31.984
<i>with a new leader</i>
<i>and a new Russia.</i>

02:38.994 --> 02:40.658
<i>...Mr. Gorbachev's</i>
<i>achievements.</i>

02:40.693 --> 02:42.433
<i>President Bush interrupted</i>

02:42.468 --> 02:44.202
<i>his Christmas holiday</i>
<i>to make a statement</i>

02:44.237 --> 02:45.734
<i>praising Mr. Gorbachev</i>
<i>for his...</i>

02:51.076 --> 02:54.906
<i>...former Soviet President</i>
<i>had inextricably altered</i>
<i>the course of history.</i>

02:54.942 --> 02:56.747
<i>The Queen</i>
<i>in her Christmas broadcast...</i>

02:56.783 --> 02:58.285
Gulliver?

02:59.455 --> 03:00.485
Gully?

03:02.924 --> 03:05.292
What's wrong
with you, hmm?

03:06.156 --> 03:07.657
What's wrong?

03:11.795 --> 03:14.433
<i>...under the oppressive</i>
<i>regime of Joseph Stalin</i>

03:14.468 --> 03:18.370
<i>led to the so called</i>
<i>'Cold War' with the West.</i>

03:18.406 --> 03:21.200
<i>Yesterday, Mr. Gorbachev</i>
<i>said his fond farewells</i>

03:21.235 --> 03:24.707
<i>to staff at the Kremlin,</i>
<i>but on the streets</i>
<i>of the capital</i>

03:24.743 --> 03:28.373
<i>few tears were shed</i>
<i>for the former head of state,</i>

03:28.408 --> 03:31.882
<i>as many are still</i>
<i>feeling the brunt of his</i>
<i>economic failures.</i>

03:56.105 --> 03:57.339
Psst.

04:24.640 --> 04:25.929
Let me go.

04:25.964 --> 04:27.770
No, I'm not going
to do that.

04:29.068 --> 04:31.378
Especially after
what you did to Gulliver.

04:32.342 --> 04:34.240
I only drugged him.

04:34.276 --> 04:36.015
Let me go.

04:36.051 --> 04:37.742
Let me go,
you fucking bitch!

04:37.777 --> 04:40.354
-Fucking-- ah!

04:45.688 --> 04:47.319
Why did you
break into my house?

04:50.799 --> 04:52.760
To steal from me?

04:52.795 --> 04:55.527
Or are you just here
to act out violence

04:55.563 --> 04:56.931
against another Jew?

04:58.841 --> 05:00.407
Oh, I know what you are.

05:01.536 --> 05:03.138
That's quite obvious.

05:04.880 --> 05:07.137
So is that it? You--

05:07.172 --> 05:11.776
you broke in to--
to hack me, to rape me?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.850
-That's fucking sick.
-No.

05:13.886 --> 05:17.215
Tattooing Nazi bile
as a death camp number,
that is sick.

05:19.987 --> 05:23.796
11-23, the date
of the Beer Hall Uprising.

05:23.832 --> 05:25.289
88, heil Hitler.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.698
You're as obvious
as you are pathetic.

05:29.733 --> 05:32.704
How about this, huh?
You know what that is?

05:32.740 --> 05:34.005
No.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.842
Yeah, I bet you do.

05:35.878 --> 05:38.141
I know who you are.

05:38.176 --> 05:40.077
Mm, Anna Marshall.

05:40.113 --> 05:41.877
I know who you are.

05:43.247 --> 05:44.814
Karl Edwards.

05:46.254 --> 05:51.452
What idiot brings his ID
to a break-in?

05:51.487 --> 05:53.350
Well...

05:54.429 --> 05:56.293
As amusing as all this is,
I think it's time

05:56.329 --> 05:57.827
to introduce you
to the police.

05:58.792 --> 06:01.431
Yeah, right.
Anna Marshall.

06:01.466 --> 06:03.002
What about
who you used to be?

06:03.038 --> 06:06.103
Brana Vasilyeva Brodskaya.

06:06.138 --> 06:08.337
Soviet translator.

06:08.373 --> 06:10.000
I know your secret, Brana.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.379
What secret?
That I was a Soviet?

06:12.415 --> 06:15.544
The Cold War is over.
Haven't you seen the news?

06:15.580 --> 06:19.279
I know what you found
in Berlin.

06:19.314 --> 06:22.753
<i>Emergency service operator.</i>
<i>Which service do you require?</i>

06:28.493 --> 06:30.495
I knew it.
I fucking knew it.

06:30.531 --> 06:32.261
The old man in Breslau
was telling the truth.

06:32.296 --> 06:34.796
Breslau?
Wroclaw.

06:34.831 --> 06:37.026
No one believed
his crazy story, but I did.

06:37.062 --> 06:38.962
I did
and I fucking found you!

06:38.997 --> 06:40.831
What old man?
What story?

06:40.866 --> 06:42.469
The story of the war.

06:42.505 --> 06:43.774
The very end of it.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.874
A group of Soviet soldiers

06:46.910 --> 06:50.341
and a female intelligence
officer with them.

06:50.377 --> 06:53.551
They found
something by the bunker
at the Chancellery

06:53.586 --> 06:56.114
Something so important
they were ordered

06:56.149 --> 06:58.120
to deliver it
back to Moscow personally.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.221
Secretly.

07:00.256 --> 07:03.120
The old man swore
he didn't know what
they were carrying,

07:03.156 --> 07:04.993
but it was enough
to get them killed.

07:06.993 --> 07:09.101
Said they all
got wiped out.

07:09.136 --> 07:11.065
All except one,
that is.

07:15.406 --> 07:16.972
What do you want
from me?

07:17.939 --> 07:20.705
History is written
by the victors.

07:20.741 --> 07:22.175
You ever hear that?

07:23.813 --> 07:26.049
I want to know
the real history.

07:26.085 --> 07:27.686
The truth.

07:28.883 --> 07:31.114
That you
and your Russian friends

07:31.150 --> 07:33.258
found evidence
of Hitler's escape

07:33.294 --> 07:35.056
and you tried
to cover it up.

07:36.023 --> 07:38.493
You found evidence
that he survived,

07:38.528 --> 07:40.266
maybe even where he went

07:40.302 --> 07:42.302
and you ferried it
back to Stalin.

07:42.338 --> 07:45.198
Or you would have,
but you got caught.

07:53.344 --> 07:55.708
Stop it. Stop it.

07:55.743 --> 07:58.519
Fucking stop it!
Stop it!

08:00.814 --> 08:01.922
What the fuck is that?

08:01.957 --> 08:03.947
This is the truth.

08:03.982 --> 08:05.790
In here is the truth.

08:07.188 --> 08:11.389
But I'm afraid
it's not quite
what you expect.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.494
You see,
throughout my life
I've seen so many men

08:14.530 --> 08:16.760
offer the truth

08:16.796 --> 08:18.261
proudly pointing

08:18.297 --> 08:22.133
to some seemingly
insignificant thing

08:22.169 --> 08:24.578
and saying,
"This is all that you see.

08:24.613 --> 08:29.114
This is what to blame.
This will fix all your ills

08:29.149 --> 08:30.749
and set you free."

08:32.484 --> 08:34.220
But they're all charlatans.

08:34.256 --> 08:37.490
Con-men scrambling
for power.

08:37.525 --> 08:40.125
And in every case,
people would eventually

08:40.161 --> 08:43.729
recognize the trick.

08:44.992 --> 08:48.268
And they'd see
with clear eyes

08:48.303 --> 08:52.936
that this magical
cure-all...

08:57.574 --> 08:59.404
was nothing but a--

09:02.314 --> 09:07.417
an empty box.

09:07.452 --> 09:10.013
-What the--

09:10.048 --> 09:11.552
what the fuck was that?

09:11.587 --> 09:13.256
The fuck is that?

09:26.164 --> 09:28.132
You drugged me.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.508
Yeah.
I'm afraid people like you

09:30.543 --> 09:34.405
can't simply be told
the truth.

09:34.441 --> 09:37.508
To truly understand it,
you have to experience it.

09:40.650 --> 09:42.249
You have to feel it.

09:52.365 --> 09:54.492
You sitting comfortably?

09:58.340 --> 10:00.898
Then I'll tell you
my story.

10:05.208 --> 10:07.945
<i>Of the last days</i>
<i>of that horrible war.</i>

10:09.316 --> 10:11.146
<i>After Berlin had fallen,</i>

10:12.452 --> 10:14.952
<i>but before it truly ended.</i>

10:16.755 --> 10:21.387
<i>I was, yes,</i>
<i>a Russian officer.</i>

10:23.198 --> 10:25.164
<i>And I was given orders,</i>

10:25.200 --> 10:29.032
<i>this secret task.</i>

10:29.067 --> 10:33.440
<i>But what you think</i>
<i>is not what we really found,</i>

10:33.475 --> 10:36.270
<i>what we sacrificed</i>
<i>everything for.</i>

10:37.442 --> 10:40.345
<i>I tried so hard</i>

10:40.380 --> 10:42.639
<i>to do what was right.</i>

11:08.742 --> 11:10.736
Comrade Lieutenant
Brodskaya.

11:10.772 --> 11:12.544
Comrade Colonel.

11:12.579 --> 11:14.647
There's been
a change of plan.

11:14.682 --> 11:16.746
Transport by plane
is no longer an option.

11:16.782 --> 11:19.182
Looks like we're walking.

11:20.118 --> 11:23.219
Captain Ilyasov and his men
will escort us to Poznan

11:23.254 --> 11:26.892
to rendezvous
with Penkovsky and board
a train to Moscow.

11:30.792 --> 11:33.189
Speak, Brana.

11:33.225 --> 11:34.794
That's over a day's drive.

11:34.829 --> 11:36.533
Longer, probably.

11:36.569 --> 11:38.266
We'll be on foot for most.

11:40.136 --> 11:41.637
I thought that time
was of the essence.

11:41.672 --> 11:43.136
It is far more important

11:43.172 --> 11:44.743
to get it back as quietly
as possible,

11:44.778 --> 11:47.239
Not even our comrades
in Berlin can know,

11:47.274 --> 11:50.240
hence no flights
and no communications.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.946
This thing
is a ticking bomb

11:51.981 --> 11:53.616
liable to blow up
in our faces

11:53.652 --> 11:55.448
if we are not too careful.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.425
Only the three of us
know of this business.

12:00.460 --> 12:01.861
Let's keep it that way.

12:04.126 --> 12:06.795
Oh, and of course
number one knows.

12:06.830 --> 12:09.262
Remember that,
both of you.

12:09.297 --> 12:12.370
Stalin himself
has given us these orders.

12:12.406 --> 12:14.069
Don't let him down.

12:14.105 --> 12:16.736
-Yes, Comrade Colonel.
-Yes, Comrade Colonel.

12:16.772 --> 12:18.944
Good.

13:04.124 --> 13:07.154
<i>Pravda denies these rumors</i>
<i>as lies.</i>

13:07.189 --> 13:09.291
<i>But despite</i>
<i>the fall of Berlin,</i>

13:09.326 --> 13:12.194
<i>German high command</i>
<i>still refuses to surrender</i>

13:12.229 --> 13:15.163
<i>and fighting continues</i>
<i>across the country.</i>

13:15.198 --> 13:17.761
<i>-Now, more than ever--</i>

13:26.171 --> 13:27.874
I'm celebrating.

13:27.909 --> 13:29.878
Celebrating what?

13:29.914 --> 13:32.281
Making it out
of Berlin alive.

13:36.951 --> 13:38.617
<i>Na Zdorovie.</i>

13:52.530 --> 13:54.699
We have to do this
every night?

13:55.904 --> 13:57.570
Not we, Grigoriy.

13:59.743 --> 14:01.640
You too, Iossif.

14:01.675 --> 14:05.314
Iossif,
get over here and help
him bury this thing.

14:09.256 --> 14:10.550
Here.

14:21.002 --> 14:24.802
You're not curious
what's inside it?

14:24.838 --> 14:26.907
Just help me with it,
will you?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.788
You don't think
that's strange,

14:43.823 --> 14:46.319
we have to bury it
every night?

14:46.355 --> 14:48.885
I think you're gonna
get us in trouble.

14:57.871 --> 15:00.206
I get my foot
and I'll flip his head.

15:56.827 --> 15:58.229
New nightmares?

15:59.465 --> 16:00.891
Or old?

16:05.636 --> 16:07.207
New.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.734
Lucky.

16:10.104 --> 16:12.679
Since Berlin.

16:12.714 --> 16:14.641
Can't seem
to get rid of them.

16:16.450 --> 16:18.117
Don't sleep.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.194
Can I ask you a question?

16:30.963 --> 16:32.857
Why do we bury it
every night?

16:38.873 --> 16:41.334
Can I ask you,
Mikhail Ivanovich,

16:41.370 --> 16:43.208
why do the others
call you Tor?

16:48.339 --> 16:50.282
It's hidden.

16:50.317 --> 16:53.246
Someone kills us
in our sleep, they still
might not find it.

16:53.281 --> 16:56.188
Like I said,
don't sleep.

17:03.927 --> 17:05.230
And the name?

17:11.396 --> 17:13.436
In Stalingrad

17:15.074 --> 17:17.473
I killed some Panzer SS
with a hammer.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.447
Tor.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.450
Norse god of thunder.

17:28.282 --> 17:30.184
He had this hammer.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.949
They gave you
a Norse name?

17:34.024 --> 17:35.593
Gave you a Slav one.

17:35.628 --> 17:36.987
It's Hebrew.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.774
Why did you use a hammer?

17:56.577 --> 17:58.316
It's all I could find
at the time.

18:22.733 --> 18:24.510
Did you find it yet?

18:24.546 --> 18:26.773
Keep looking.

18:29.881 --> 18:32.108
Lt. Brodskaya.

18:34.049 --> 18:35.749
Lieutenant.

18:38.023 --> 18:40.292
-Brana! Get up.

18:41.322 --> 18:43.496
Time to dig up the dead.

18:43.532 --> 18:45.396
Come on, get up.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.791
Let's go.

18:47.826 --> 18:50.095
I guess that well
has run dry again.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.666
Yeah.

19:24.302 --> 19:26.371
Welcome back to Poland.

20:04.407 --> 20:05.542
Keep off the back.

20:08.783 --> 20:10.376
-Keep pushing!
-Right.

20:10.411 --> 20:12.585
-Push!
-Keep pushing!

20:12.621 --> 20:14.179
Keep pushing!

20:25.130 --> 20:27.366
-Push up!
-Here we go.

20:31.069 --> 20:32.602
-Come on!
-Come on!

20:35.002 --> 20:36.936
We don't want
to get stuck again.

20:41.339 --> 20:44.216
We'll reach the outskirts
of Poznan by nightfall.

20:44.252 --> 20:46.910
Should be enough time
to make the last train.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.778
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

20:48.813 --> 20:50.420
We'll be driving
in the dark.

20:50.455 --> 20:52.983
We should find somewhere
to camp around here.

20:53.018 --> 20:56.260
We have plenty of time
to get to the city.

20:56.295 --> 20:59.625
-Better to get to the--

20:59.661 --> 21:01.667
-Get down! Get down!

21:01.702 --> 21:03.264
Take cover!

21:07.501 --> 21:09.135
Sniper. Single shooter.

21:09.170 --> 21:10.607
Where?

21:20.086 --> 21:21.684
Where the hell
is he going?

21:36.862 --> 21:39.405
-German.
-You sure? Not Polish?

21:45.273 --> 21:46.643
Werewolf.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.141
That's not good.

21:51.547 --> 21:52.617
We should get back
on the road.

21:52.653 --> 21:53.782
No.

21:54.881 --> 21:56.719
-We need to bury the body.
-What?

21:56.754 --> 22:00.086
No. There could
be more out there.
More werewolf.

22:00.122 --> 22:02.622
It's just an old man
with a rifle from
the Prussian War.

22:02.658 --> 22:05.124
No, we stay,
we bury our comrade.

22:06.027 --> 22:09.025
Or would you rather dishonor
our Comrade Colonel

22:09.060 --> 22:11.096
by leaving him
on the side of the road?

22:12.070 --> 22:13.803
We make camp here.

22:13.839 --> 22:15.431
Tor.

22:16.267 --> 22:19.168
-You're up. Burial duty.
-I did it last night.

22:19.204 --> 22:21.304
Then you'll be getting
good at it, won't you?

22:33.461 --> 22:35.424
We still have time
to make the rendezvous.

22:35.460 --> 22:37.556
No, we're staying here.

22:37.592 --> 22:39.355
And that's the end of it.

22:40.692 --> 22:42.699
I'm in charge now.

23:06.818 --> 23:08.294
Where are you going?

23:08.329 --> 23:09.929
To find supplies
in the village near here.

23:09.964 --> 23:12.355
-You can't.
-Can't?

23:13.330 --> 23:15.696
I mean, we shouldn't.

23:15.731 --> 23:18.537
It's not safe.
We need to guard this.

23:20.403 --> 23:21.801
You can protect it.

23:21.836 --> 23:23.800
But our orders.
You're supposed to--

23:23.836 --> 23:25.475
Fine, you take these three

23:25.510 --> 23:27.512
and they can protect you,
Vasilyeva.

23:27.547 --> 23:30.678
It's not safe to split up
the group, Ilyasov.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.747
Look around you.
There's no one here.

23:33.782 --> 23:36.283
There's no one watching.
No one cares.

23:36.319 --> 23:37.882
The war is over.

23:37.918 --> 23:39.992
-The war is not over.
-Ours is.

23:40.027 --> 23:41.989
And you,
you've ripped us

23:42.024 --> 23:44.720
from our
well-earned celebrations,
so we're owed.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.429
Spoils of war.

23:46.464 --> 23:48.530
We're owed that much
at least.

23:48.566 --> 23:50.693
But don't worry,
we'll be careful.

23:50.729 --> 23:52.230
We'll be quiet.

23:53.330 --> 23:54.969
We're just gonna go
and find some warmth.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.104
And then we'll come
straight back.

23:58.879 --> 24:00.208
Damn fool.

24:00.244 --> 24:01.475
What was that?

24:01.510 --> 24:03.015
What about the werewolf?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.941
Don't worry, Vasilyeva.

24:04.976 --> 24:06.950
There's no full moon
tonight.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.327
Don't believe him.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.929
Spoils of war.

24:25.965 --> 24:27.870
I know exactly
what that means.

24:28.537 --> 24:29.804
You want to sit down?

24:29.839 --> 24:31.869
God knows what kind
of mess he'll cause.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.673
Let's go
get the back then.

24:33.709 --> 24:34.870
We can't leave it
unguarded.

24:34.906 --> 24:36.012
Well, then I'll go.

24:36.047 --> 24:37.708
Alone.

24:37.744 --> 24:39.277
He'll listen to you?

24:42.885 --> 24:45.555
I'll go.
You stay and look
after the crate.

24:45.590 --> 24:48.652
-He'll listen to you?

24:48.688 --> 24:50.156
He'll listen.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.335
You know,
my mother used to have
that exact same look

24:57.371 --> 24:59.200
when my father
didn't come home.

24:59.236 --> 25:00.570
Oh, yeah?

25:00.605 --> 25:02.773
How'd that work out
for your father?

25:22.523 --> 25:23.860
Stay here.

25:34.735 --> 25:36.939
-Open up!

25:39.509 --> 25:41.977
Sorry, tavern closed.

25:44.315 --> 25:47.345
No, it's not.

26:02.828 --> 26:04.532
<i>Na Zdorovie!</i>

26:04.567 --> 26:06.037
-Whoa!

26:06.073 --> 26:07.772
Don't waste it!

26:09.235 --> 26:11.510
Oh, here she comes.
Where've you been?

26:11.546 --> 26:13.005
I thought you were out
the back killing a pig.

26:13.040 --> 26:15.005
-What's that? That pork?

26:15.041 --> 26:17.047
Oh, right,
want some of that?

26:17.083 --> 26:19.279
Days old.

26:19.315 --> 26:20.686
Hey.

26:22.288 --> 26:23.887
You the only one here?

26:27.159 --> 26:28.325
I get more.

26:28.360 --> 26:29.895
Yeah, go get some more.

26:57.619 --> 26:59.781
Where you going?

26:59.817 --> 27:01.485
Hmm?

27:04.758 --> 27:06.791
You know, Tor,

27:06.827 --> 27:08.360
I want to thank you

27:09.699 --> 27:11.864
for offering
to leave me here

27:11.899 --> 27:13.695
with the woman
and the boy.

27:14.698 --> 27:17.141
You always try to get out
of your chores, Grigoriy.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.543
Yeah.

27:18.578 --> 27:21.046
It is a chore
making conversation

27:21.082 --> 27:22.275
with you two.

27:27.385 --> 27:29.012
What is that?

27:29.047 --> 27:30.987
Werewolf light reading.

27:35.122 --> 27:36.918
You talked about
werewolves before.

27:36.954 --> 27:38.357
Werewolf.

27:41.967 --> 27:45.366
You think they were talking
about real werewolves?

27:45.401 --> 27:47.135
No, I...

27:53.237 --> 27:56.342
Hey. Hey.
Ignore him.

27:58.412 --> 28:00.786
It's Goebbels' idea
of a more frightening name.

28:00.821 --> 28:02.621
Make them sound
more threatening
than what they are.

28:02.657 --> 28:05.752
Old men and Hitler youth
with knives and sticks

28:05.787 --> 28:07.591
hiding in the forest.

28:07.627 --> 28:10.158
Fools who
won't give up the fight.

28:16.302 --> 28:17.935
<i>Memento Mori.</i>

28:20.173 --> 28:21.700
It's Latin.

28:21.736 --> 28:23.976
You speak Latin?

28:24.011 --> 28:25.641
No, I--

28:25.676 --> 28:27.036
I just know
what it means.

28:27.072 --> 28:29.174
That's good, Iossif.

28:29.209 --> 28:31.677
You're obviously
an educated young man.

28:31.712 --> 28:33.181
Not like us.

28:34.452 --> 28:35.755
What does it mean?

28:36.883 --> 28:38.318
Remember death.

28:40.324 --> 28:44.562
In Rome,
when soldiers returned home
from victorious battle,

28:44.598 --> 28:46.824
people used to shout this
at them.

28:46.860 --> 28:48.493
Remember death.

28:49.902 --> 28:53.664
They just defeated armies
and cheated death

28:53.699 --> 28:56.206
and so needed
to be reminded they were
still mortal men,

28:56.242 --> 28:57.403
not gods.

29:01.207 --> 29:04.179
Remember death comes
to us all.

29:21.063 --> 29:22.758
You know, when we passed
through here,

29:24.371 --> 29:26.036
we weren't far off this.

29:28.273 --> 29:31.872
We wanted blood,
revenge for what the Germans
had done to us.

29:31.908 --> 29:34.545
We became
what they feared.

29:34.580 --> 29:36.277
What they painted us
to be.

29:37.811 --> 29:39.478
Monsters.

29:44.289 --> 29:45.385
Then--

29:46.924 --> 29:48.861
then we found
their death camps.

29:50.631 --> 29:52.865
You saw what they
were capable of.

30:01.240 --> 30:03.909
There's no such thing
as victorious battle
anymore, Iossif.

30:04.905 --> 30:06.274
Not in this war.

30:08.272 --> 30:10.014
Anyone who survives it,

30:11.278 --> 30:13.083
won't need any reminder
of death.

30:30.866 --> 30:32.503
-Ilyasov.
-Jesus!

30:32.539 --> 30:34.236
This doesn't concern you.

30:35.233 --> 30:37.272
Go, get out of here.

30:39.844 --> 30:41.545
What the hell
are you doing?

30:41.580 --> 30:43.940
Listen to me, you pig!

30:43.975 --> 30:46.744
Your reckless,
drunken behavior is now
endangering our mission.

30:46.780 --> 30:48.019
Hey!

30:51.287 --> 30:53.290
Who do you think you are
talking to me like that?

30:58.455 --> 31:00.291
You know,
where I'm from,

31:00.327 --> 31:02.465
women don't talk
to men like this.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.927
Get off me.

31:06.331 --> 31:09.031
Spoil my fun, eh?

31:13.613 --> 31:15.441
Get off me,
you filthy pig.

31:15.476 --> 31:17.372
Maybe I should teach
you a lesson instead, eh?

31:17.407 --> 31:19.548
Fucking hell!

31:19.584 --> 31:21.415
Oh, you bitch!

31:30.322 --> 31:31.689
Lower your gun.

31:33.399 --> 31:34.428
Lower it.

31:36.896 --> 31:38.203
Don't.

31:38.238 --> 31:39.862
Don't.

31:46.878 --> 31:48.741
You speak German?

31:48.777 --> 31:50.411
So do you.

31:51.309 --> 31:52.948
Kill this fucking Nazi.

31:52.983 --> 31:54.745
I'll deal with you
in a second.

31:56.248 --> 31:57.646
What are you doing here?

31:57.681 --> 32:00.784
I live near here.
I heard screaming.

32:02.289 --> 32:04.395
-Was it just you--

32:04.431 --> 32:05.763
What was that?

32:05.799 --> 32:07.331
-It came from the tavern.
-Move.

32:07.366 --> 32:09.001
Move!

32:14.599 --> 32:16.066
The place is on fire!

32:16.102 --> 32:17.702
Ilyasov, wait.

32:33.856 --> 32:35.390
Ilyasov, get back.

32:39.123 --> 32:40.857
Makar!

32:43.231 --> 32:45.194
What the hell
happened here?

32:45.230 --> 32:46.566
We should leave.

32:48.908 --> 32:51.475
Dimitry!
You're okay, you're okay.

32:51.511 --> 32:53.045
Can you talk?

32:54.547 --> 32:55.905
Can you hear me?

32:57.044 --> 32:58.283
What happened?

32:58.318 --> 33:00.043
Smoke.

33:01.717 --> 33:03.621
Poison.

33:03.656 --> 33:05.953
Who did this?

33:05.988 --> 33:07.721
I don't know.

33:07.757 --> 33:09.457
Werewolf.

33:12.632 --> 33:14.456
Why do you say that?

33:14.491 --> 33:17.127
They hide in the forest.

33:17.163 --> 33:19.132
Watch the town.

33:19.167 --> 33:21.205
They use tactics
like this.

33:23.711 --> 33:25.872
They burn lichen
and mushroom.

33:30.246 --> 33:31.842
Makes you hallucinate.

33:33.114 --> 33:34.882
Makes you see things.

33:34.917 --> 33:36.850
I scared them off.

33:36.886 --> 33:38.720
How many, Makar?

33:38.756 --> 33:40.284
I don't know.

33:40.319 --> 33:41.984
Watch the town for what?

33:43.287 --> 33:44.626
Russians.

33:44.662 --> 33:46.160
Like you.

33:46.195 --> 33:47.866
Fritz is probably
one of them.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.592
-He's Polish, Ilyasov.
-Then he's AK.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.365
Probably led them
straight to us.

33:51.400 --> 33:53.266
If anyone led them to us,
it's you, Vadim.

33:53.301 --> 33:55.235
-This is your fault.
-My fault?

33:55.271 --> 33:56.832
I told you
not to leave the crate.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.803
After the sniper in the forest,
we should have--

34:00.205 --> 34:01.806
The forest.

34:21.402 --> 34:22.928
Grigoriy.

34:24.635 --> 34:26.602
Iossif.

34:44.823 --> 34:46.950
-Tor?

34:50.155 --> 34:51.790
Grisha.

34:52.730 --> 34:54.324
Grigoriy.

34:57.536 --> 34:59.171
Tor?

35:32.868 --> 35:34.371
Hey.

36:33.865 --> 36:34.893
Up.

36:53.586 --> 36:55.254
Papa?

37:56.442 --> 37:58.917
Iossif. Iossif.

37:58.952 --> 38:01.119
It's me. It's me.
It's me.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.017
You're okay. You're okay.
The smoke.

38:03.053 --> 38:04.614
It's the smoke.

38:04.649 --> 38:06.053
It makes you see things.

38:08.295 --> 38:10.461
Look. Look, it's fine.
Where are the others?

38:11.426 --> 38:13.357
Where's Tor and Grigoriy?

38:13.393 --> 38:14.698
Truck's gone.

38:14.733 --> 38:16.060
Shit.

38:17.336 --> 38:18.703
Let's get the crate
and get out of here.

38:18.739 --> 38:20.464
What, on foot?

38:20.499 --> 38:21.802
Give me your gun.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.403
You let her take my gun.

38:25.438 --> 38:26.902
You need me armed.

38:26.937 --> 38:28.507
I need you to help
carry this.

38:28.543 --> 38:30.447
What,
all the way to Poznan?

38:30.483 --> 38:33.782
No, we should stay and fight
these peasant dogs.

38:33.817 --> 38:37.116
These dogs
managed to sneak up
and kill two of ours.

38:37.151 --> 38:38.822
Three.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.854
Found Grigoriy.

38:44.330 --> 38:47.157
You're a coward.
We should stand and fight.

38:47.192 --> 38:50.024
And you're forgetting again
what we were sent to do.

38:50.060 --> 38:52.462
Not to fight,
not to make noise.

38:52.498 --> 38:54.129
To protect this.

38:54.164 --> 38:56.965
What's this?
What are you talking about?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.968
We can't carry it
all the way,

38:59.004 --> 39:01.175
but we can find somewhere
to stash it.

39:01.210 --> 39:03.038
Somewhere to hide.

39:03.073 --> 39:04.376
Can we make it back
to the village?

39:04.412 --> 39:05.912
We'd be too exposed.

39:08.218 --> 39:09.520
I might know somewhere.

39:11.088 --> 39:12.823
Somewhere safe.

39:12.858 --> 39:14.492
Where's Tor?

39:15.493 --> 39:17.495
Make a last sweep.
See if you can see him.

39:18.693 --> 39:20.498
If he's still alive,
he'll find us.

39:22.902 --> 39:24.667
Help me with this.

40:56.293 --> 40:57.826
You were told to wait.

40:58.966 --> 41:00.389
They split up.

41:01.535 --> 41:04.970
We took the chance to take
them in smaller groups.

41:05.005 --> 41:06.395
And did you take them?

41:07.568 --> 41:09.564
A few may have escaped.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.244
May? I'm not sure
how this digs itself
out of the ground.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.741
There were more
than we expected.

41:15.777 --> 41:16.905
Which is why
I told you to wait.

41:16.941 --> 41:18.979
-We'll find them.
-It!

41:20.284 --> 41:23.522
Find it.
Kill them.

41:26.122 --> 41:27.625
Wait.

41:30.860 --> 41:32.493
Maybe you and your men
will have better luck

41:32.528 --> 41:34.225
with the weapons
we brought.

41:46.506 --> 41:48.239
It's close.

41:49.543 --> 41:50.681
I can feel it.

42:09.793 --> 42:11.394
Hey, stop.

42:16.040 --> 42:17.569
Stop.

42:17.604 --> 42:19.372
Are you with them?

42:19.407 --> 42:21.241
<i>Deutsche?</i>

42:21.276 --> 42:22.680
<i>Polskie?</i>

42:25.484 --> 42:27.476
I'm not going
to hurt you, okay?

42:29.552 --> 42:30.816
What are you
doing out here?

42:30.851 --> 42:33.625
Hey, I need to find
my people.

42:43.730 --> 42:45.826
What are you doing?

42:48.199 --> 42:50.532
Stop! I said
I wouldn't hurt you.

42:52.037 --> 42:53.744
I'm going
to let you go now.

42:55.048 --> 42:56.910
But if you scream

42:56.945 --> 42:59.343
I'll have to stop you.
Do you understand?

43:08.121 --> 43:10.629
You are from the village,
yes, Wioska?

43:11.427 --> 43:12.763
Yes, from village.

43:13.727 --> 43:15.491
So you do understand me?

43:18.669 --> 43:21.068
I need you to show me
the way there.

43:22.101 --> 43:24.071
I need to find
the others like me.

43:27.579 --> 43:30.408
If you run
or try and signal anyone--

43:30.444 --> 43:31.815
Yes.

43:33.548 --> 43:35.280
You understand me?

43:36.219 --> 43:37.381
Yes.

43:42.655 --> 43:44.663
All right.

43:53.138 --> 43:54.563
Yeah, right.

44:10.983 --> 44:12.280
That's the place?

44:12.316 --> 44:14.725
Yeah, we'll be safe there.

44:14.761 --> 44:17.324
The people that live there,
they're good people.

44:17.359 --> 44:18.689
Kind.

44:18.725 --> 44:20.996
They'll help us.

44:21.897 --> 44:24.127
Last time Russians
came through here,

44:24.162 --> 44:26.034
they murdered people
like this.

44:27.173 --> 44:28.465
Just for helping.

44:30.271 --> 44:31.974
Just promise me you're not
like the rest of them.

44:35.473 --> 44:37.740
If you promise me
you're not like the others.

44:37.776 --> 44:39.080
Out there.

44:42.483 --> 44:44.153
Okay.

44:44.189 --> 44:45.856
Wait here.

44:54.499 --> 44:55.956
I doubt
we'll see him again.

44:55.992 --> 44:57.200
Stop that.

44:57.236 --> 44:58.663
He's helping us.

44:58.698 --> 45:00.469
What, Fritz?

45:00.504 --> 45:01.801
You trust him, do you?

45:01.837 --> 45:03.467
More than I trust you,
Ilyasov.

45:04.738 --> 45:06.569
Comrade Captain.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.108
Don't forget
where you're from, girl.

45:09.143 --> 45:10.941
I'm not the one forgetting
where I'm from.

45:10.976 --> 45:12.673
Or what my orders are.

45:12.709 --> 45:15.409
And if we make it back
to where we're both from,

45:15.445 --> 45:17.589
if we make it out
of here alive,

45:17.624 --> 45:19.788
I'll make sure they know
that your behavior

45:19.823 --> 45:21.788
directly went against
our orders.

45:21.823 --> 45:23.320
That you
got those men killed

45:23.355 --> 45:25.629
and jeopardized our mission,
Comrade Captain.

45:25.664 --> 45:27.898
Just keep your distance
from me, Ilyasov

45:29.900 --> 45:31.594
I don't enjoy being
this close to you.

46:02.826 --> 46:06.068
So what are you doing
all this way out
in the forest?

46:13.607 --> 46:15.077
Huh.

46:17.411 --> 46:19.744
Still, you're running about
in the woods at night?

46:19.780 --> 46:21.547
I run from you.

46:21.582 --> 46:23.185
From me?

46:23.221 --> 46:24.755
Why?

46:24.790 --> 46:27.287
Bolsheviks like you
who come into village.

46:28.185 --> 46:30.128
What about the Germans?

46:30.163 --> 46:32.422
<i>Niemiecki,</i>

46:32.458 --> 46:35.131
hiding in the forest,
do you know about them?

46:35.166 --> 46:38.529
Hey, hey, what about
the Germans hiding
in this forest?

46:40.230 --> 46:42.502
-Werewolf?
-Yes.

46:42.538 --> 46:43.908
Werewolf.

46:44.774 --> 46:46.537
You're not afraid
of them?

46:47.674 --> 46:49.278
No.

46:49.314 --> 46:51.080
Hey, stop.

46:54.049 --> 46:56.048
They are not as bad
as Bolsheviks.

46:56.083 --> 46:57.614
Don't you say things
like that.

46:58.816 --> 47:01.154
You're lucky
you bumped into me
and not one of them.

47:01.189 --> 47:02.986
You don't know what
you are talking about.

47:03.021 --> 47:04.419
You have no idea.

47:04.455 --> 47:05.793
You don't know
what they're like.

47:05.828 --> 47:07.690
I know
what you are like.

47:08.525 --> 47:11.502
Bolsheviks, Germans,
both the same.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.899
Only Germans
have gone now.

47:13.934 --> 47:15.940
Bolsheviks have come.

47:18.509 --> 47:21.209
Murdering, rape.

47:23.548 --> 47:25.444
Killing my parents.

47:28.617 --> 47:30.251
For lies.

47:32.755 --> 47:34.483
For helping Germans.

47:34.518 --> 47:37.896
Helping like they had
any choice.

47:41.798 --> 47:43.759
I'm not afraid
of Germans.

47:45.638 --> 47:47.697
They are not
a threat anymore.

47:49.872 --> 47:51.734
Because we forced them out.

47:55.911 --> 47:58.180
And who will force
you out?

48:08.458 --> 48:09.686
Go.

48:11.496 --> 48:12.887
I'll find my way.

48:15.029 --> 48:17.364
Go.
I'm letting you go.

48:31.275 --> 48:32.841
Village is that way.

48:42.429 --> 48:43.788
-Down!

48:43.824 --> 48:45.463
Get down.

48:45.498 --> 48:47.999
-Get down!

48:49.028 --> 48:50.727
No, no, no, no.

48:51.736 --> 48:53.864
No, no, come on.
Come on. No.

48:55.398 --> 48:59.376
No, no, no. Please.

48:59.412 --> 49:01.276
No. No, no, no.

49:03.381 --> 49:04.642
Please.

49:20.365 --> 49:21.659
Hey.

49:45.319 --> 49:48.085
It's okay.
It's okay.

49:54.657 --> 49:56.397
We need your help.

50:03.604 --> 50:05.905
No, no, no.
There's no body in there.

50:36.433 --> 50:37.832
No.

50:37.867 --> 50:40.468
-What are you doing?
-We need their help.

50:40.503 --> 50:41.904
Well, put a gun on them.

51:10.871 --> 51:13.072
Is that?

51:15.275 --> 51:17.208
He shot himself

51:17.243 --> 51:18.906
in his bunker in Berlin.

51:18.941 --> 51:21.812
Pravda said reports
of his death were lies.

51:23.781 --> 51:25.981
-They weren't.
-How do you know?

51:28.660 --> 51:30.285
We made sure.

51:30.321 --> 51:32.526
Dental records.

51:35.232 --> 51:37.161
Now you understand
why we need your help.

51:37.197 --> 51:39.036
We need to hide it.

51:39.072 --> 51:41.199
There are men,
werewolf trying
to find it.

51:41.234 --> 51:43.005
-Hey!

51:43.040 --> 51:44.575
What are you doing?
He's dead.

51:44.610 --> 51:45.907
He can die again.

51:45.942 --> 51:47.640
We have to preserve it.

51:49.814 --> 51:51.281
Formaldehyde.

51:52.546 --> 51:54.317
How long can you
really expect that to last?

51:55.447 --> 51:57.116
Long enough
to get it back.

51:57.151 --> 51:58.684
To show it to Stalin.

51:59.683 --> 52:01.389
Ask them where
we can put it.

52:01.425 --> 52:03.458
It needs hiding until
we can find new transport.

52:05.655 --> 52:08.190
Hey!
This is important.

52:08.225 --> 52:09.961
No, this

52:09.997 --> 52:11.895
dangerous.

52:13.230 --> 52:14.704
You...

52:18.276 --> 52:21.245
-Destroy it.
<i>-Nie, nie.</i> Burn.

52:23.880 --> 52:25.440
I can't do that.

52:35.157 --> 52:36.854
I think she knows.

52:38.530 --> 52:40.022
I know.

52:41.667 --> 52:43.366
And what it means.

52:44.497 --> 52:46.336
That's why
we have to hide it.

52:53.776 --> 52:55.070
Okay.

52:57.582 --> 52:59.077
Whoa.

52:59.113 --> 53:00.916
He won't fit.

53:00.951 --> 53:02.814
He needs to come out.

53:08.288 --> 53:12.054
Okay.
One, two, three.

53:22.603 --> 53:25.738
Why don't we burn it?
What he deserves.

53:27.509 --> 53:29.837
It's also what he wanted.
To disappear.

53:29.873 --> 53:31.947
People to not see him
like this.

53:31.982 --> 53:33.784
Killed by his own hand.

53:33.820 --> 53:36.015
So why are you hiding it?

53:36.051 --> 53:37.580
To protect it.

53:37.616 --> 53:39.886
It has to go back.
For proof.

53:39.921 --> 53:41.620
Proof?

53:41.655 --> 53:43.956
-The dental records.
-Stalin needs to see it.

53:43.992 --> 53:45.659
He needs--

53:46.829 --> 53:48.222
What?

53:49.665 --> 53:51.566
In Russia, we like to look
our enemy in the eye.

53:52.662 --> 53:54.165
You wouldn't understand.

53:54.201 --> 53:55.970
You're right.

53:56.006 --> 53:58.206
I don't understand.

53:58.241 --> 54:00.135
What if you lose it?
What if--

54:01.380 --> 54:04.282
what if you die
trying to protect
the secret, huh?

54:32.911 --> 54:34.411
What about your secret?

54:37.050 --> 54:38.778
This place
is for hiding people.

54:40.119 --> 54:41.781
My guess is
it's been hiding you.

54:43.055 --> 54:44.388
That's why
you know about it.

54:46.651 --> 54:49.184
Who are you hiding from?
Hmm?

54:50.127 --> 54:52.154
Who are you really,
Lucasz?

54:58.738 --> 55:00.536
<i>Volksdeutsche.</i>

55:03.767 --> 55:05.442
That's what they call us.

55:07.046 --> 55:09.138
Polish
with German heritage.

55:10.817 --> 55:13.241
Barely, but enough.

55:13.276 --> 55:15.980
When they invaded
they gave me one
simple choice--

55:17.921 --> 55:19.549
join them

55:19.584 --> 55:21.656
or go to the labor camp.

55:23.654 --> 55:25.691
So when I signed up,

55:25.726 --> 55:28.025
they promised me
that I would keep my home.

55:29.558 --> 55:32.260
They promised me
that my wife would be
spared from the camp.

55:34.731 --> 55:36.869
They lied.
They lie.

55:39.009 --> 55:40.235
It's what they do.

55:44.381 --> 55:46.443
So when I heard
that she'd been taken.

55:46.478 --> 55:48.309
I deserted, but...

55:53.423 --> 55:55.118
by the time I got there
it was too late.

55:57.490 --> 55:58.924
She was already dead.

56:02.828 --> 56:06.094
The Soviets
were advancing, so...

56:06.129 --> 56:08.472
If they found me,
they would have shot me.

56:10.772 --> 56:13.103
Germans are being pushed
back across the border,

56:14.441 --> 56:15.842
but some of them stayed.

56:16.772 --> 56:18.080
Becoming werewolf.

56:18.115 --> 56:20.081
Surrounding villages.

56:20.116 --> 56:22.381
Taking reprisals.

56:22.416 --> 56:25.118
A few Russians, but...

56:25.154 --> 56:26.985
mostly Poles.

56:29.019 --> 56:31.561
Villagers they consider
to be traitors.

56:34.065 --> 56:35.895
So I hid from both.

56:37.200 --> 56:38.832
I hid from both sides.

56:41.941 --> 56:43.540
Just like my country.

56:45.935 --> 56:47.808
We're surrounded by wolves.

56:55.612 --> 56:57.048
I'm sorry.

57:01.290 --> 57:03.054
I know what that's like.

57:06.655 --> 57:07.993
Do you?

57:10.969 --> 57:12.602
To lose someone?

57:16.900 --> 57:18.872
To be surrounded
by wolves.

57:42.067 --> 57:43.391
Why don't we just leave?

57:44.466 --> 57:47.065
-And go where?
-The fight.

57:47.100 --> 57:50.174
-The war is over, my friend.
-Then why chase this?

57:50.209 --> 57:52.173
Because this
isn't the war now.

57:52.209 --> 57:54.875
This is everything.

58:05.853 --> 58:07.388
We found him
in the forest.

58:07.423 --> 58:08.652
Did you ask him
where it is?

58:08.687 --> 58:11.060
He only speaks Russian.

58:27.470 --> 58:29.976
Do you know
what the<i> Ahnenerbe </i> is?

58:31.642 --> 58:36.279
It means I know
everything there is to know
about the human body.

58:37.816 --> 58:39.513
You have
an exquisite skull.

58:43.653 --> 58:46.530
My colleague and I
have come a very long way

58:46.566 --> 58:49.191
because of our interest
in a specific human body.

58:49.226 --> 58:52.097
One that we believe you
might know about.

58:59.903 --> 59:01.403
Where is the Führer?

59:04.478 --> 59:06.309
Where is the body?

59:07.782 --> 59:10.547
Where is it?
Where is the Führer?

59:22.134 --> 59:24.192
This won't hurt as much,

59:24.227 --> 59:27.099
but it will blind you
permanently.

59:34.371 --> 59:36.113
They found the others.

59:36.148 --> 59:37.780
They found the others.

59:53.799 --> 59:55.825
Milosz thinks
there's a horse and cart
in the village

59:55.860 --> 59:57.765
that he can bargain for.

59:57.800 --> 1:00:00.970
Your comrade Ilyasov
wants to go with him.

1:00:01.005 --> 1:00:03.069
No. No.

1:00:18.818 --> 1:00:20.582
He's out there.

1:00:20.618 --> 1:00:21.956
Tor.

1:00:23.328 --> 1:00:25.289
No, I meant the necklace.

1:00:40.738 --> 1:00:42.108
Bolsheviks.

1:00:44.040 --> 1:00:46.015
We have your comrade.

1:00:47.442 --> 1:00:50.283
Give us the body
and we'll let him live.

1:00:50.318 --> 1:00:51.818
Shit.

1:00:51.853 --> 1:00:53.413
Do you think you could
make that shot?

1:00:53.448 --> 1:00:55.726
We'd have to take
both of them out.

1:00:57.430 --> 1:00:59.494
Either of us miss
and he's dead.

1:00:59.529 --> 1:01:01.089
We should
just give it up.

1:01:01.125 --> 1:01:02.530
They're gonna
kill him anyway,

1:01:02.566 --> 1:01:03.862
may as well save
the rest of us.

1:01:03.897 --> 1:01:05.960
It's just a trophy
for Stalin.

1:01:05.996 --> 1:01:07.294
Get back downstairs.

1:01:07.329 --> 1:01:09.634
Make sure
no one gets in. Now!

1:01:09.670 --> 1:01:11.137
Give me back my gun.

1:01:15.181 --> 1:01:16.546
You two go with him.

1:01:16.581 --> 1:01:18.309
Secure those windows
and entrances.

1:01:19.817 --> 1:01:21.917
This thing
is more important
than any of us.

1:01:24.285 --> 1:01:26.152
Let's hope
they don't figure out
where it is, then.

1:01:32.124 --> 1:01:34.655
Come on, Tor.
Give me something.

1:01:45.202 --> 1:01:47.206
Uh, there's a wolf
at the door.

1:02:18.368 --> 1:02:20.404
They don't seem to care.

1:02:42.495 --> 1:02:44.257
I'm gonna keep on
putting holes in you

1:02:44.293 --> 1:02:46.067
until you lose that smile.

1:02:49.869 --> 1:02:52.205
-Fire!

1:03:06.158 --> 1:03:07.413
Let me look.

1:03:07.449 --> 1:03:09.456
Stop shooting,
you'll hit it.

1:03:09.491 --> 1:03:11.961
Halt! Halt!

1:03:12.658 --> 1:03:14.258
Here.

1:03:14.294 --> 1:03:16.933
Order those wolves
to get in that house now!

1:03:19.469 --> 1:03:20.901
Get downstairs.

1:03:20.937 --> 1:03:23.038
Make sure they barricaded
those doors.

1:03:26.104 --> 1:03:28.134
-Is anyone hurt?
-We're fine.

1:03:38.647 --> 1:03:41.386
Where's Vadim?
Where's Ilyasov?

1:04:05.307 --> 1:04:07.447
What?
What is it?

1:04:07.482 --> 1:04:09.018
Ilyasov.

1:04:15.417 --> 1:04:17.091
What the hell
is he doing?

1:04:17.127 --> 1:04:20.590
He wants an exchange.
His life for information.

1:04:22.394 --> 1:04:25.326
And what information
would be worth his life?

1:04:25.361 --> 1:04:27.465
He knows where
the body is.

1:04:32.906 --> 1:04:35.002
He sold us out.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:37.475
Fucking knew I should
have killed him when
I had the chance.

1:04:55.364 --> 1:04:58.125
That's it.
They shot him because
he went for the shed.

1:04:58.161 --> 1:04:59.702
It's in there.

1:04:59.737 --> 1:05:01.902
Fall back.
Circle around to it.

1:05:01.938 --> 1:05:04.271
I want confirmation
it's there.

1:05:06.878 --> 1:05:09.606
Congratulations.
You just bought your life.

1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:15.011
If they didn't before,
they know it's there now.

1:05:15.047 --> 1:05:16.910
We need to move out.

1:05:19.519 --> 1:05:22.385
I'll get it on the truck,
you meet me at the church.

1:05:22.420 --> 1:05:25.151
Wait for my signal,
then finish it.

1:05:25.187 --> 1:05:27.063
Burn them.

1:05:38.003 --> 1:05:39.000
Fuck.

1:05:50.521 --> 1:05:52.517
Fire on the house!

1:06:07.901 --> 1:06:09.468
Do something.

1:06:24.655 --> 1:06:26.221
-Hey!

1:06:29.859 --> 1:06:31.724
-Ludmila!

1:06:31.760 --> 1:06:33.525
Get downstairs.

1:06:41.563 --> 1:06:43.837
Iossif, damn it,
fire back!

1:06:50.879 --> 1:06:52.215
It's okay.
It's okay.

1:06:52.251 --> 1:06:54.075
Shh.

1:07:15.700 --> 1:07:18.240
-Open up! It's me.
It's Tor.

1:07:23.109 --> 1:07:25.241
Wait, Iossif!

1:07:33.690 --> 1:07:35.521
Lucky bastard.

1:07:48.073 --> 1:07:50.170
-They're trying
to burn us out.

1:07:50.206 --> 1:07:51.566
Aren't they risking
burning the body?

1:07:51.602 --> 1:07:53.743
-It's not in the house.
-Oh, shit.

1:07:53.779 --> 1:07:55.475
That's why
we have to go now.

1:08:01.147 --> 1:08:02.185
Sleep well, friend.

1:08:08.184 --> 1:08:09.523
On me.

1:08:10.426 --> 1:08:12.593
-Three...
-Head for the cover
of the trees.

1:08:12.628 --> 1:08:14.263
...two.

1:08:27.370 --> 1:08:28.772
They're gone.

1:08:32.308 --> 1:08:34.184
Brana. Wait.

1:08:36.916 --> 1:08:38.353
No!

1:08:47.196 --> 1:08:49.265
The truck!
They're getting away!

1:08:52.195 --> 1:08:53.566
Wait!

1:08:58.410 --> 1:09:00.072
Brana!

1:09:00.107 --> 1:09:02.135
-Stop!
-Let go of me!

1:09:03.143 --> 1:09:05.012
It's over!
It's over!

1:09:05.048 --> 1:09:07.481
-It's not over for me!
-Why?

1:09:43.280 --> 1:09:45.354
Oh, fuck!

1:10:13.709 --> 1:10:15.351
In a church?

1:10:56.828 --> 1:10:58.328
Brana!

1:11:01.030 --> 1:11:03.190
Brana, you're okay.

1:11:04.800 --> 1:11:05.896
No.

1:11:07.430 --> 1:11:08.734
It's over.

1:11:11.367 --> 1:11:12.808
No.

1:11:12.844 --> 1:11:14.471
Tor overheard them.

1:11:14.507 --> 1:11:16.071
He knows where
they're headed.

1:11:17.882 --> 1:11:19.748
They're at the church.

1:11:19.783 --> 1:11:20.944
What church?

1:12:10.300 --> 1:12:12.366
We should leave
and do this elsewhere.

1:12:12.401 --> 1:12:14.496
We won't get far
with a body in tow.

1:12:14.532 --> 1:12:16.501
It's degrading fast.

1:12:16.537 --> 1:12:18.936
We must do this now
and quickly.

1:12:20.104 --> 1:12:22.504
Record evidence that this
is not the Führer.

1:12:22.540 --> 1:12:24.509
That he's not dead.

1:12:24.545 --> 1:12:27.109
-That it's a fake.
-But it is him.

1:12:28.780 --> 1:12:31.180
Spectacle is what
the people crave.

1:12:32.283 --> 1:12:34.556
You give them that
and they'll believe
whatever you tell them.

1:12:37.151 --> 1:12:39.423
We mustn't let the idea
of what he was,

1:12:39.458 --> 1:12:41.590
what we all fought for,

1:12:41.625 --> 1:12:43.295
die with the rest of us.

1:12:43.330 --> 1:12:44.659
Are we to die as well?

1:12:44.694 --> 1:12:46.466
-Yes!

1:12:46.501 --> 1:12:48.700
Because that is what
sets us apart.

1:12:48.735 --> 1:12:52.374
Every ounce,
every drop of blood
used up.

1:12:52.409 --> 1:12:54.876
Because anything less
than total sacrifice

1:12:54.911 --> 1:12:56.677
is to lose.

1:13:08.353 --> 1:13:09.690
And besides,

1:13:10.653 --> 1:13:12.423
death is nothing

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:14.596
if the legacy lives on.

1:13:21.037 --> 1:13:22.538
I know this girl.

1:13:25.042 --> 1:13:26.575
Another innocent life.

1:13:31.645 --> 1:13:33.978
That's why we have
to get it back.

1:13:34.986 --> 1:13:37.216
So we can die as well?

1:13:37.251 --> 1:13:39.380
So he doesn't win.

1:13:39.416 --> 1:13:41.253
Who?

1:13:41.288 --> 1:13:43.317
He's dead, Brana.

1:13:44.491 --> 1:13:46.655
You've seen
what I've seen.

1:13:46.690 --> 1:13:48.956
He murdered millions.

1:13:48.992 --> 1:13:51.000
Not in battle,
but in cold blood.

1:13:51.035 --> 1:13:52.667
He murdered innocent--

1:13:54.337 --> 1:13:56.297
he would sacrifice
every man,

1:13:57.536 --> 1:13:59.542
every woman, child,

1:14:00.871 --> 1:14:02.908
an entire nation
bled to death,

1:14:04.475 --> 1:14:05.911
for power.

1:14:07.280 --> 1:14:08.518
For winning.

1:14:13.091 --> 1:14:14.722
Men like that
don't die.

1:14:15.923 --> 1:14:18.286
They fester in the ground
infecting everything.

1:14:21.190 --> 1:14:23.225
I want them to see him
before he's buried.

1:14:24.566 --> 1:14:26.827
I want to bleach
every bone in the sun

1:14:26.862 --> 1:14:28.098
so that they will know

1:14:30.172 --> 1:14:32.370
he was just a man.

1:14:32.405 --> 1:14:34.038
A coward of a man.

1:14:43.083 --> 1:14:45.522
I guess that would
make me a coward, too,
not to help.

1:14:47.653 --> 1:14:49.317
You'd still be a good man.

1:14:54.728 --> 1:14:56.764
No one ever accused me
of that before.

1:14:59.530 --> 1:15:01.098
Well, I am.

1:15:09.575 --> 1:15:11.209
Have you got a plan?

1:15:11.244 --> 1:15:12.945
I might.

1:15:17.479 --> 1:15:20.788
<i>As the autopsy proves,</i>
<i>this is yet another lie.</i>

1:15:20.824 --> 1:15:23.821
<i>It's quite clearly</i>
<i>not the body of the Führer.</i>

1:15:23.857 --> 1:15:25.626
<i>Both the teeth</i>
<i>and the organs show</i>

1:15:25.662 --> 1:15:27.787
<i>that this man was different</i>
<i>in age and--</i>

1:15:30.793 --> 1:15:32.701
Gas! Gas! Gas!

1:15:33.535 --> 1:15:35.066
The skull!
I need the skull!

1:15:36.171 --> 1:15:38.036
Down! Down!

1:15:53.253 --> 1:15:54.624
Shoot!

1:17:27.149 --> 1:17:28.751
No!

1:18:28.774 --> 1:18:30.472
Help them.

1:18:31.049 --> 1:18:32.578
Help them.

1:18:32.613 --> 1:18:35.675
Help. Help them.

1:19:02.545 --> 1:19:06.114
Hold him still.

1:19:06.150 --> 1:19:07.509
Hold him!

1:19:14.292 --> 1:19:15.517
Fuck you!

1:20:17.454 --> 1:20:19.515
It's over, little man.

1:21:05.798 --> 1:21:06.963
-No!

1:21:26.690 --> 1:21:28.218
Give it to me.
Give it to me.

1:21:28.253 --> 1:21:30.220
Give me the body.
I will let you go.

1:21:30.255 --> 1:21:32.494
I will let you live.
Open the door.

1:21:32.529 --> 1:21:35.525
Open the door!
No!

1:21:38.829 --> 1:21:40.162
No, no!

1:21:40.198 --> 1:21:42.700
No, no.
Don't touch this. No!

1:21:42.735 --> 1:21:45.205
No, no! No!

1:21:48.544 --> 1:21:49.871
Give me the body.

1:21:54.042 --> 1:21:55.512
No!

1:21:57.485 --> 1:21:59.078
No!

1:22:02.523 --> 1:22:05.918
No! No!

1:22:11.664 --> 1:22:13.497
No!

1:22:14.264 --> 1:22:16.700
Help! Help!

1:22:16.735 --> 1:22:18.073
No! No!

1:22:23.139 --> 1:22:25.113
Sorry, Brana.

1:22:28.615 --> 1:22:31.350
No!

1:23:03.086 --> 1:23:05.646
<i>Strange to think</i>
<i>at that same time</i>

1:23:05.682 --> 1:23:08.684
<i>Keitel was signing</i>
<i>the German surrender.</i>

1:23:10.353 --> 1:23:12.226
Nobody came
looking for us.

1:23:14.061 --> 1:23:15.856
Presuming we were
all dead.

1:23:16.996 --> 1:23:19.563
Or just hoping we were.

1:23:21.934 --> 1:23:24.532
<i>After the fire</i>

1:23:24.567 --> 1:23:26.603
<i>all that was left</i>
<i>were fragments.</i>

1:23:27.542 --> 1:23:28.968
<i>Pieces.</i>

1:23:31.448 --> 1:23:33.181
<i>And bones.</i>

1:23:41.692 --> 1:23:43.653
<i>When I got back to Moscow</i>

1:23:45.360 --> 1:23:48.355
the cover-up,
designed to keep
the Allies on side,

1:23:48.390 --> 1:23:50.066
had gone on too long.

1:23:52.192 --> 1:23:55.368
Would be embarrassing
for Stalin to be caught
in a lie.

1:23:58.938 --> 1:24:00.703
So they buried me.

1:24:02.374 --> 1:24:04.674
And any evidence
I brought with me.

1:24:09.579 --> 1:24:12.649
Six cold years
in a Siberian gulag.

1:24:14.955 --> 1:24:16.389
That's where I left her.

1:24:17.660 --> 1:24:19.260
Brana Brodskaya.

1:24:20.455 --> 1:24:22.054
That's where she died.

1:24:24.869 --> 1:24:27.059
Along with her hopes
and her ideals.

1:24:29.206 --> 1:24:32.108
And any notions of exposing
the truth to the world.

1:24:38.873 --> 1:24:41.315
When I was released,
I went back to Poland.

1:24:42.486 --> 1:24:43.977
To Wroclaw.

1:24:44.952 --> 1:24:46.716
To visit an old friend.

1:24:51.457 --> 1:24:54.262
This belonged to the man
who saved my life.

1:24:58.365 --> 1:25:00.466
<i>He was there</i>
<i>when I needed someone.</i>

1:25:01.429 --> 1:25:03.469
<i>My darkest hour.</i>

1:25:05.437 --> 1:25:07.605
<i>Helped me</i>
<i>to pick up the pieces.</i>

1:25:09.305 --> 1:25:10.905
<i>Set me free.</i>

1:25:17.019 --> 1:25:19.450
When I heard
that he had died,

1:25:19.485 --> 1:25:23.284
after being attacked
in a supposed break-in,

1:25:23.319 --> 1:25:25.524
I was quite upset.

1:25:28.493 --> 1:25:30.760
History isn't written
by the victors.

1:25:32.069 --> 1:25:35.270
It's remembered
by those that survive it.

1:25:37.268 --> 1:25:38.900
And when they're gone,

1:25:40.703 --> 1:25:43.278
how do we avoid
repeating history?

1:25:49.654 --> 1:25:51.319
How do we remember?

1:26:34.663 --> 1:26:36.421
There.

A memento.

1:27:15.666 --> 1:27:17.537

it was meant for you.

1:27:19.843 --> 1:27:21.233
For people like you.

1:27:35.621 --> 1:27:38.151
So at least you got
what you came for.

1:27:39.563 --> 1:27:40.923
A box.

1:27:42.964 --> 1:27:44.894
A magical box.
