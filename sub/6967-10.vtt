00:18.084 --> 00:22.919
We got a fire off County Road D7, two miles
west of the Canyon Ridge intersection.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.423
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.

00:27.727 --> 00:30.457
This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?

00:32.332 --> 00:34.425
Son of a...

00:54.154 --> 00:57.988
Sir? Sorry to disturb you,
but we've picked up an identified bogey.

00:58.091 --> 01:00.787
I think you should see the replay for yourself.

01:12.739 --> 01:16.675
It tripped the fence at 23.17
off the coast of Connecticut, sir.

01:16.743 --> 01:20.076
Initial trajectory was north by northwest,
then it went crazy.

01:20.146 --> 01:24.947
- What about other aircraft or missile testing?
- No known aircraft can maneuver like this.

01:26.953 --> 01:29.945
Whatever it was
dropped off the screen at 24.18, sir.

01:30.023 --> 01:33.686
Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan,
outside Townsend, Wisconsin.

01:33.760 --> 01:37.628
The impact-prediction team
calculated impact at over 800mph.

01:39.032 --> 01:41.227
I've told Chief Koretz to start her report.

01:41.334 --> 01:43.325
- Use these tapes to...
- Negative.

01:45.038 --> 01:49.372
She tracked a meteor. Its aberrant movement
was due to instrument malfunction.

01:49.442 --> 01:53.242
- But, sir...
- Your report will reflect these facts. Clear?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.412
Yes, sir.

01:56.316 --> 01:58.181
Good.

02:06.159 --> 02:08.957
Code Indigo Delta Echo Niner.

02:09.027 --> 02:12.623
I have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87.

02:12.732 --> 02:16.395
Mobilize Operation Falcon immediately.

02:33.186 --> 02:35.177
Hello?

03:46.859 --> 03:52.422
They will have no comment until
the government investigation is completed.

03:52.498 --> 03:56.161
Government offiicials remain vague
about the toxic cargo

03:56.269 --> 04:01.764
that has caused the immediate evacuation
of Townsend, Wisconsin's 12,000 residents.

04:01.874 --> 04:05.674
Speculation here has centered on
a shipment of toxic waste.

04:05.745 --> 04:08.873
Then what happened
if it wasn't a train wreck?

04:08.982 --> 04:13.976
Mr Mulder, the continental US
is surrounded by an electronic fence

04:14.087 --> 04:17.784
that reaches 15,000 miles into space.

04:18.558 --> 04:25.691
We use it to track and monitor the
7,087 man-made objects that orbit the Earth.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.895
Last night at 23.17 that fence was breached.

04:30.003 --> 04:34.906
This morning at 01.00
Operation Falcon went into effect,

04:35.008 --> 04:40.139
led by Colonel Calvin Henderson,
the Air Force's premier reclamations expert.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.737
Reclamations?

04:41.814 --> 04:46.683
During the Cold War his job was to prevent
technologies from downed US aircraft

04:46.753 --> 04:49.085
from getting into Soviet hands.

04:49.155 --> 04:51.953
He's... part of a crash-retrieval unit?

04:54.193 --> 04:56.525
Quick response.

04:56.596 --> 05:00.623
I'd say you have... 24 hours

05:00.733 --> 05:03.031
before the entire area is sanitized.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.763
After that,

05:04.837 --> 05:07.601
be like nothing ever happened.

05:54.287 --> 05:57.415
Let's go! Go! Go!

05:57.490 --> 05:59.583
On the double!

06:19.112 --> 06:21.205
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.578
Get it going. Let's go! Let's go!

06:27.186 --> 06:30.678
- All right, let's move out!
- Roadblock needs to be in place.

06:30.790 --> 06:33.281
All right. I'll get right on it, sir.

06:44.103 --> 06:48.437
- You're late. It's gonna be dark in a half-hour.
- We had a flat outside the perimeter, sir.

06:48.508 --> 06:52.672
There's a briefing at 22.00,
but first go to headquarters for live rounds.

06:52.745 --> 06:54.235
Live rounds, sir?

06:54.313 --> 06:57.874
- Got a problem with that?
- No, sir! We were told this is a drill.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.076
- They told you wrong.
- Sir.

07:02.655 --> 07:05.749
OK, everyone out!
Come on, people! Light a fire!

09:49.255 --> 09:53.419
You just made the worst mistake of your life,
Agent Mulder.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.055
I think you knocked out a filling.

09:58.130 --> 10:01.190
I'll see to it you pay the price
for putting my men at risk.

10:01.267 --> 10:04.703
Since when does taking pictures
put anyone's life at risk?

10:04.804 --> 10:09.002
You violated a US government quarantine
and that's a federal crime.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.736
A quarantine? Is that what you call this?

10:11.844 --> 10:15.473
We're trying to contain an ecological disaster.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.642
That's a lot of fire power
just to protect Mother Nature.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.311
I have my orders.

10:22.421 --> 10:25.254
And the license to execute them as I see fit.

10:25.324 --> 10:29.920
I suggest you forget what you saw
or what you think you saw

10:30.029 --> 10:32.122
for your own well-being.

10:32.231 --> 10:37.567
You've got a downed craft in those woods,
sir, and troops carrying live rounds.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.934
We both know what's out there!

10:43.843 --> 10:47.176
- Come on, move it.
- That's right, buddy. Get goin'.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.173
Get in there.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.724
You MUFON or CUFOS?

11:08.134 --> 11:10.193
Do you mind if I sit down?

11:10.569 --> 11:14.096
No. Let me guess.
You're with that new group. CSICOP, right?

11:17.209 --> 11:21.145
Say no more. You're a cautious man.
Trust no one - very wise.

11:21.414 --> 11:24.906
After what happened to JFK,
I understand completely.

11:24.984 --> 11:26.975
Let me introduce myself.

11:27.119 --> 11:32.318
Max Fenig. I'm with the National Investigative
Committee of Aerial Phenomena.

11:33.392 --> 11:35.019
NICAP.

11:36.796 --> 11:40.163
Pleased... pleased
to make your acquaintance.

11:41.300 --> 11:44.326
I wish we could shake on it, you know?

11:44.403 --> 11:48.169
Firm grip. Look right in the eye.
You learn a lot about a guy that way.

11:50.976 --> 11:54.207
Can I... Can I ask you a question?

11:55.548 --> 11:56.981
Go ahead.

11:57.116 --> 11:59.983
Did you see anything? Did you get close?

12:00.119 --> 12:02.713
Me, I saw nothing. I didn't see anything!

12:03.589 --> 12:08.959
Nada. Zip. 100 yards past the roadblock
they nailed me. I have no idea how they did it.

12:09.028 --> 12:12.964
I'm telling you,
it's like the Roswell cover-up all over again.

12:14.366 --> 12:16.561
What makes you so sure
there's something out there?

12:20.005 --> 12:22.769
Same thing that makes you so sure.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.699
I didn't order room service.

12:55.808 --> 12:57.867
This isn't funny, Mulder.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.275
- Did you meet Max?
- Who?

13:00.379 --> 13:02.438
Max from NICAP.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.375
They must have released him.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.443
Another intrepid soul
in search of a close encounter.

13:08.521 --> 13:10.250
Is that what this is about?

13:11.824 --> 13:13.189
What else?

13:13.259 --> 13:15.784
Try explaining that to Section Chief McGrath.

13:15.861 --> 13:19.991
He stepped over Blevins, ordering
a full inquiry with a recommendation...

13:20.065 --> 13:24.001
Mulder, he wants to shut down the X-Files
and he wants you out of the Bureau.

13:24.069 --> 13:26.230
What else is new?

13:26.305 --> 13:28.671
I don't understand you, Mulder!

13:28.741 --> 13:31.266
Why you're always defying protocol,

13:31.343 --> 13:33.504
ignoring jurisdiction.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.671
Because I know what I saw, Scully.

13:35.748 --> 13:39.684
There were no train tracks, so
how could it have been a derailed container?

13:39.752 --> 13:41.652
Because it wasn't.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.245
What you saw was not a toxic spill.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.416
But it wasn't a UFO either.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.353
OK, I'm all ears. What was it?

13:50.462 --> 13:53.954
It was a downed Libyan jet
with a nuclear warhead.

13:55.968 --> 13:58.334
Over US airspace?

13:58.437 --> 14:03.773
They picked up low-grade levels of radiation,
so the plutonium casing may have cracked.

14:03.876 --> 14:05.707
So to avoid mass panic...

14:05.778 --> 14:10.442
- You really believe that story?
- That story happens to be highly classified.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.882
A highly classified lie.

14:15.988 --> 14:20.391
- They're searching for someone, Scully.
- Then it's probably the pilot.

14:20.492 --> 14:24.360
You think they'd roll out all this material
for one Libyan fighterjock?

14:26.732 --> 14:30.190
Besides, no human pilot
walked away from the wreckage I saw.

14:31.904 --> 14:33.963
Maybe he ejected.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.573
Maybe.

15:20.719 --> 15:22.778
You can't be serious.

15:22.855 --> 15:25.949
As long as we're in beautiful
downtown Townsend, why not?

15:26.025 --> 15:30.621
- The hearing is tomorrow at ten o'clock.
- That gives us 24 hours to investigate.

15:30.729 --> 15:34.062
My assignment is to bring you back,
not to dig you in deeper.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.667
The Last Detail, starring Dana Scully.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.740
What's going on?

15:48.814 --> 15:51.840
Looks like housekeeping
hasn't been here yet.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.213
What...

16:19.278 --> 16:21.109
Max?

16:22.982 --> 16:25.041
Get your hands up!

16:25.117 --> 16:27.449
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Max?

16:33.025 --> 16:35.255
My apologies. Forgive me, please.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.989
I-I-I'm a curious man. I had to know.

16:38.063 --> 16:40.122
- Know what?
- If it was really you.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.428
But you don't know me.
Last night was the first time we met.

16:43.502 --> 16:48.940
Not true. NICAP have followed your career
closely ever since you got put on the X-Files.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.602
- Followed my career? How?
- With the Freedom of Information Act.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.476
Your travel expenses
are a matter of public record.

16:57.316 --> 17:01.116
So, this must be
the... enigmatic Agent Scully.

17:03.489 --> 17:07.949
- How did you recognize me?
- I saw your picture in a trade publication,

17:08.060 --> 17:12.087
and I read your article in Omni
about the Gulf Breeze sightings.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.865
- I published that under a pseudonym.
- MF Luder. I know.

17:16.935 --> 17:19.699
MF Luder's an anagram for F Mulder.

17:19.771 --> 17:23.070
You really didn't think
that would fool us, did you?

17:24.276 --> 17:26.267
I didn't think anybody was paying attention.

17:27.279 --> 17:29.509
Somebody's always paying attention,
Mr Mulder.

17:30.849 --> 17:31.781
Amazing.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.352
Amazing? Hardly!

17:34.453 --> 17:38.082
You wanna see something amazing,
come with me.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.085
"The enigmatic Dr Scully."

17:53.906 --> 17:56.602
This is my... Right this way.

17:57.476 --> 17:59.171
Excuse the mess.

17:59.311 --> 18:02.405
OK. Where's those...

18:06.819 --> 18:09.481
Let me turn this off. They're right here.

18:11.957 --> 18:13.424
Here they are.

18:13.525 --> 18:18.155
Latest crop circle photos
from Project Argus. Huh?

18:18.297 --> 18:21.733
- Your opinion: Fact or fraud?
- Fraud.

18:21.800 --> 18:24.564
How do you explain
the blisters on the plants?

18:24.636 --> 18:27.104
It's either a weathering effect

18:27.172 --> 18:30.107
or the plant's reaction
to being in one position.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.643
- You've read the literature.
- I try to keep up.

18:32.744 --> 18:35.440
- What about...
- Max, you had something to show us.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.639
Oh, yeah, yeah.

18:37.583 --> 18:40.051
The Wolf's Ear 2000. You ever hear of this?

18:40.152 --> 18:43.918
Yeah. Wolf Industries supplies the CIA
with surveillance equipment.

18:43.989 --> 18:47.720
State-of-the-art search and intercept.
100 channels per second.

18:47.793 --> 18:51.957
I'm jacked into local fire and police
departments, cellular phone pathways,

18:52.030 --> 18:56.558
and, when the weather's right, air-traffic
control from Whitmarsh Air Force Base.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.000
What have you got?

18:59.171 --> 19:02.572
Mobile-unit broadcast in scan mode.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.769
Townsend Sheriff's Department
two nights ago.

19:06.745 --> 19:09.441
We got a fiire off County Road D7,

19:09.548 --> 19:12.449
two miles west
of the Canyon Ridge intersection.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.019
Suggest we dispatch fiire crews. Over.

19:15.087 --> 19:17.282
This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?

19:18.023 --> 19:22.460
And then this, 35 minutes later,
presumably from the fire crew.

19:22.561 --> 19:24.961
Reception got wiggy for some reason.

19:25.030 --> 19:28.989
This is Unit 53. Man down.
Request medevac.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.399
I said, request medevac!

19:32.104 --> 19:36.564
You're breaking up... barely... bad, very bad.

19:36.642 --> 19:39.042
Wait a sec. What the hell?

19:39.111 --> 19:42.512
Charlie! We got a situation here!

19:44.783 --> 19:46.648
We put up a tight net.

19:46.718 --> 19:51.621
Yes, sir. Every inch of ground is being
covered, dug up, squeezed and sifted.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.056
No, sir, it will not get away.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.458
Not this time.

20:17.683 --> 20:19.674
Mrs Wright?

20:19.751 --> 20:22.515
Hi, I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're from the FBI.

20:22.621 --> 20:25.146
We have a few questions
about your husband.

20:25.290 --> 20:26.917
He's dead!

20:27.025 --> 20:29.084
What else is there to know?

20:35.734 --> 20:38.498
- I'm sorry about your husband.
- Oh, please!

20:38.570 --> 20:41.733
- Mrs Wright, we want to help you.
- Then leave me alone!

20:41.840 --> 20:45.367
- Why won't you let us help you?
- I don't know anything!

20:53.151 --> 20:55.551
Don't you understand?

20:55.654 --> 21:00.489
They won't even release the body
so I can give him a proper burial, OK?

21:00.559 --> 21:03.357
The government can't do that.

21:03.462 --> 21:07.364
- I'm sure if we appeal to...
- No! You can't.

21:07.466 --> 21:09.366
You're entitled to the truth.

21:09.468 --> 21:12.266
I can't afford the truth.

21:14.506 --> 21:18.738
They said if I spoke to anyone,
they would withhold my husband's pension.

21:18.810 --> 21:21.108
And I have a child to take care of.

21:29.588 --> 21:33.354
Picking up an extremely high-frequency
signal. 200,000 megahertz.

21:33.425 --> 21:34.687
Sir.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.320
Target on the northeast side.

21:37.396 --> 21:40.422
Foot speed: 7mph, sir.

21:41.033 --> 21:43.092
- Beta team?
- Copy.

21:43.168 --> 21:45.568
Target entering your section.

21:45.637 --> 21:47.332
Search and destroy.

21:47.406 --> 21:49.772
Repeat: Search and destroy.

21:49.841 --> 21:51.968
Yes, sir.

22:40.392 --> 22:42.451
- Jackson?
- Nothing.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.170
Must have been an animal.

23:19.898 --> 23:24.926
I'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena,
I can't discuss patient information.

23:25.036 --> 23:27.197
So Jason Wright was your patient?

23:27.272 --> 23:30.935
I have nothing more to say about this.

23:31.042 --> 23:35.069
What about to his wife and child?
Would you have anything to say to them?

23:35.147 --> 23:37.741
Because whoever got to you also got to her.

23:37.849 --> 23:40.113
They must have made some big threats.

23:40.218 --> 23:44.154
What'd they hold over your head?
Your medical license? The IRS?

23:46.057 --> 23:48.218
- I hate fascists.
- Excuse me?

23:48.293 --> 23:52.059
The men who came in here,
the way they pushed us all around.

23:55.834 --> 24:00.100
Dr Oppenheim, tell us about the deputy.
You saw him that night, didn't you?

24:01.907 --> 24:04.171
Yes, and three others from a fire crew.

24:04.276 --> 24:08.770
They were DOA with fifth- and sixth-degree
burns to over 90%% % of their bodies.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.678
But they weren't like any burns I've seen,

24:11.750 --> 24:14.981
and they took the bodies
before we could perform pathology.

24:15.987 --> 24:19.150
Did you note any cadaveric heat rigor
or heat stiffening?

24:19.257 --> 24:23.057
Yes, there was quite a bit of flexion
in the limbs. How do you know so much?

24:23.128 --> 24:26.689
I did my residency in forensic medicine, so...

24:26.765 --> 24:32.067
Dr Oppenheim, could those burns
have been caused by ionizing radiation?

24:33.205 --> 24:34.900
I hadn't thought...

24:34.973 --> 24:39.774
I suppose it's possible,
if the exposure were sufficiently intense.

24:42.747 --> 24:45.215
Say the men died from radiation exposure.

24:45.317 --> 24:49.981
- Can't it have been from a nuclear warhead?
- I've read about these kinds of burns.

24:50.088 --> 24:54.548
- So have I, in Hiroshima at ground zero.
- I mean close-encounter mortalities.

24:54.626 --> 24:58.426
I have a stack of X-Files
reporting the same clinical results.

24:58.530 --> 25:00.760
I don't claim to know all the answers,

25:00.832 --> 25:03.892
but if we don't make
the OPR inquest by tomorrow

25:03.969 --> 25:06.028
there may not be any more X-Files.

25:50.815 --> 25:53.943
Start an IV here.
D5, half-normal saline at 150.

25:54.019 --> 25:58.615
- Tell us what happened out there.
- Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.

25:58.690 --> 26:02.558
Wrong, Colonel. We both want
the same thing, only you want it dead.

26:02.627 --> 26:07.087
Can't you see by chasing it like an animal
you leave it no choice but to defend itself?

26:07.198 --> 26:10.656
How many more have to die
before you rethink your approach?

26:10.769 --> 26:13.897
Listen to me, cos I'm not
wasting another breath on this.

26:14.005 --> 26:18.374
- If you two aren't outta here in 30 seconds...
- Agent Scully stays here!

26:18.476 --> 26:21.104
We're undermanned, she's a doctor.
She stays.

26:21.212 --> 26:23.442
- If that's OK with you.
- Of course.

26:23.515 --> 26:27.474
Doctor, if you don't mind, just take care
of my men and let me do my work, OK?

26:30.055 --> 26:35.049
Outside this emergency room you can do
whatever you want, but here I call the shots.

26:35.927 --> 26:40.091
Assuming, of course,
you want me to take care of your men.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.866
Get this man out of my sight.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.029
Yes, sir.

26:48.506 --> 26:50.531
Where do I scrub up?

27:06.324 --> 27:08.224
Max?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.253
Hey, Max?

27:11.963 --> 27:14.056
Max?

27:56.141 --> 27:58.006
Hey, Max.

27:59.511 --> 28:01.570
Who are... who are you?

28:03.915 --> 28:05.974
Max, it's me. Fox Mulder.

28:07.385 --> 28:09.512
You OK?

28:10.889 --> 28:12.948
What are you doing here?

28:17.128 --> 28:19.756
You were having some kind of seizure.

28:19.831 --> 28:22.163
Seizure?

28:22.233 --> 28:24.326
That's impossible.

28:30.575 --> 28:34.136
You were lying on the floor unconscious,
convulsing.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.612
That's odd.

28:37.716 --> 28:42.244
I haven't had an episode in seven years,
not since I went on medication.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.988
- Let's get you to the hospital.
- No!

28:48.827 --> 28:50.920
I mean, it's not necessary.

28:50.995 --> 28:53.930
- Sure?
- Yeah, I've lived with epilepsy all my life.

28:53.998 --> 28:56.057
I'm not in any danger.

29:10.648 --> 29:13.674
Yeah, it started in South Dakota
when I was ten.

29:14.753 --> 29:19.747
The doctor said I must have incurred a head
injury. I don't remember ever hitting my head.

29:19.824 --> 29:22.486
When you have seizure,
you have no memory of it?

29:24.062 --> 29:29.056
As a kid I used to wake up in strange places
with no idea where I was or how I got there.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.073
I'm sorry. I got...

29:37.175 --> 29:39.803
- I gotta... I gotta go sleep.
- All right.

30:37.435 --> 30:39.335
Rough night, huh?

30:39.437 --> 30:41.769
It was terrible.

30:41.873 --> 30:44.171
We lost all but two.

30:44.275 --> 30:49.178
They're still in critical condition, on their way
to the burn unit at Johns Hopkins.

30:50.281 --> 30:53.717
So what do you think, Scully?
What's going on out there?

30:54.752 --> 30:56.652
I don't know.

30:56.721 --> 31:00.179
And, under other circumstances,
I would like to find out,

31:00.291 --> 31:03.385
but we have a plane to catch
in just over an hour.

31:03.528 --> 31:06.361
I want you to take a look at something first.

31:06.464 --> 31:08.898
- What?
- Max.

31:08.967 --> 31:14.166
There's an unusual incision behind his
left ear. I've seen this incision twice before.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.107
Two women 1,000 miles apart.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.474
No way of knowing each other, no relation.

31:20.578 --> 31:23.342
Both claim to have been abducted by aliens.

31:24.983 --> 31:27.679
Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee?

31:29.354 --> 31:30.821
Mulder,

31:30.922 --> 31:36.019
the man is taking powerful
anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV.

31:36.127 --> 31:38.595
- They're for his epilepsy.
- Not all of them.

31:38.696 --> 31:44.692
Dilantin is an anticonvulsant, but Mellaril
is used exclusively to treat schizophrenia.

31:44.769 --> 31:47.101
More than likely, Max is delusional.

31:48.006 --> 31:50.099
You don't understand, Scully.

31:50.174 --> 31:53.769
Max doesn't believe
he was abducted by aliens. I believe he was.

31:55.813 --> 31:59.909
Now, could you at least look at the scar
and give me your medical opinion?

32:03.655 --> 32:05.748
OK.

32:05.823 --> 32:09.054
You pack, I'll take a look at Max

32:09.160 --> 32:11.219
on the way to the airport.

32:14.132 --> 32:16.862
Sir, I have flash traffic at 24.18.

32:18.236 --> 32:23.230
Repeated calls for ID go unanswered and
it's not in the orbital or suborbital inventory.

32:23.341 --> 32:26.469
- 24.18. Isn't that where?
- Same exact spot, sir.

32:26.611 --> 32:30.570
- Though I am reading a larger craft this time.
- Meteor, Miss Koretz.

32:30.648 --> 32:34.209
A much larger meteor... sir.

32:34.285 --> 32:37.686
- Whitmarsh Tracking SSC. We have a bogey.
- Hold on a second.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.986
We have a confirm.
Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking.

32:41.059 --> 32:43.994
- Where is it?
- Sector 35, 53,000ft, zero velocity.

32:44.062 --> 32:49.432
Well, sir, the meteor seems to be hovering
over a small town in eastern Wisconsin.

32:49.567 --> 32:51.398
We have a bogey. Confiirm.

33:47.358 --> 33:50.759
Come on, Mulder. Let's get this over with.

33:52.263 --> 33:54.322
Hey, Max?

33:54.899 --> 33:56.127
Max!

34:00.772 --> 34:02.865
Hey, Max?

34:11.916 --> 34:13.975
Mulder, look at this.

34:14.952 --> 34:17.250
What is that? Blood?

34:23.860 --> 34:27.194
Falcon Patrol reporting unidentifiied trespass.

34:27.297 --> 34:32.496
Repeat: Falcon Patrol reporting unidentifiied
trespass at the waterfront. Dock 7.

34:37.108 --> 34:38.768
- Mulder!
- Come on!

34:38.876 --> 34:40.935
Where do you think you're going?

34:41.012 --> 34:44.106
If we go to the airport now,
we might make the plane,

34:44.181 --> 34:47.174
which would give you a chance
of defending yourself.

34:47.284 --> 34:50.583
Think about it, Scully.
Max is a gypsy, a nomad, right?

34:50.688 --> 34:52.315
Yeah. So what?

34:52.389 --> 34:55.085
So he intercepted Deputy Wright's last call,

34:55.159 --> 34:58.686
which means he was here in Townsend
the night of the crash.

34:58.763 --> 35:01.493
Of all the places he could have been,
he was here.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.090
Don't you think it's more than a coincidence?

35:04.168 --> 35:07.399
If Max was abducted,
that would explain his obsessions.

35:07.505 --> 35:10.440
And if we figured that out,
Henderson has as well.

35:10.541 --> 35:12.634
D'you have the keys?

35:41.005 --> 35:44.600
- Don't do this!
- Sir, we have the target. It's just a civilian.

35:44.675 --> 35:47.872
Negative, Falcon Patrol.
Take him with extreme caution.

36:10.101 --> 36:12.001
They're dead.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.017
It hurts. Stop.

36:28.085 --> 36:29.677
Why, why, why, why?

36:29.787 --> 36:32.278
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts...

36:32.390 --> 36:34.517
- Max?
- It hurts. It hurts.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.685
Stop it, it hurts. It hurts. Stop it, it hurts...

36:37.795 --> 36:40.821
- It's all right.
- Stop it, it hurts...

36:40.898 --> 36:44.061
No. No, it's me. They're coming for me.

36:45.670 --> 36:48.798
Now I know that's...
that's why they're coming for... me.

36:50.741 --> 36:53.039
- It hurts...
- Keep 'em out.

37:06.524 --> 37:08.492
Alpha team, secure the roof.

37:11.562 --> 37:15.089
Hold it right there!
Put your hands up and come with us!

37:17.134 --> 37:19.227
Give me a hand now!

37:19.303 --> 37:21.362
Go! Go! Go!

37:23.441 --> 37:25.500
Quadrant 4, move in!

37:30.448 --> 37:32.507
Alpha team ready on the roof.

37:34.151 --> 37:36.517
Roger, Alpha. Delta team, report.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.714
Delta team in position, sir.

37:41.692 --> 37:44.718
What are you doing?
You have a very sick man in there.

37:44.795 --> 37:48.697
We're not in the hospital now, Dr Scully.
Omega team report.

37:48.766 --> 37:52.202
- Omega team in position.
- He's a delusional schizophrenic.

37:52.303 --> 37:54.362
Keep her clear.

37:55.072 --> 38:00.169
Sir, this is Alpha team leader. I'm picking up
three forms inside the structure.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.371
Did you say three forms?

38:02.480 --> 38:04.675
That's affirmative.

38:04.749 --> 38:06.740
Two are proximate.

38:08.152 --> 38:10.017
The third,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.180
approaching from 40 meters.

38:14.759 --> 38:17.353
All teams, prepare for go in 30 seconds.

38:17.428 --> 38:19.760
Come on! Come on, Max.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.923
Come on, stop. Why...

38:21.999 --> 38:24.092
I'm here to help you.

38:26.003 --> 38:28.198
- I'm scared.
- I know.

38:28.306 --> 38:32.208
- Don't let 'em take me.
- I won't let 'em take you.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.801
Come on, Max. Come with me.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.914
No!

38:45.523 --> 38:47.388
Max!

39:38.476 --> 39:44.108
Sir, this is Alpha team leader. Except for
our men, I'm only picking up one fiigure inside.

39:44.215 --> 39:45.648
I do not copy that.

39:45.783 --> 39:49.378
We indicate only one figure
inside the building.

39:49.453 --> 39:52.388
- What?
- Blow the door!

39:55.526 --> 39:57.619
Take him!

40:09.807 --> 40:11.638
Where is he?

40:13.077 --> 40:14.942
He's gone.

40:15.045 --> 40:18.606
They got to him first. They beat us, Colonel.

40:19.650 --> 40:21.743
Arrest him.

40:23.454 --> 40:25.513
And keep looking!

40:31.061 --> 40:35.293
Agent Scully, to the best of your knowledge,
was Agent Mulder ever assigned

40:35.366 --> 40:40.099
to investigate matters related to
the evacuation of Townsend, Wisconsin?

40:40.938 --> 40:42.064
No, sir.

40:42.139 --> 40:45.666
At any time were you aware of
his submitting a form 302,

40:45.776 --> 40:49.177
requesting said assignment
or travel expenses?

40:50.047 --> 40:51.105
No, sir.

40:51.182 --> 40:55.881
While in Wisconsin,
did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus,

40:55.986 --> 40:58.546
registered to the State Car Rental Agency?

40:59.323 --> 41:00.517
Yes, sir.

41:00.591 --> 41:02.718
Thank you, Agent Scully.

41:02.793 --> 41:06.661
- Sir, request permission to make a statement.
- Request denied.

41:06.764 --> 41:09.892
Sir, it's unfair to judge Mulder
by the same criteria...

41:09.967 --> 41:12.595
You're dismissed, Agent Scully.

41:12.736 --> 41:15.500
- But, sir...
- That will be all!

41:28.018 --> 41:31.818
D'you hear that noise, Scully?
Hammer and nails.

41:31.922 --> 41:34.948
They're building a gallows
in the town square.

41:36.193 --> 41:38.093
Don't worry.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.027
It was only a matter of time.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.291
I'm surprised I lasted this long.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.493
Good luck.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.628
I'll break a leg.

42:07.458 --> 42:10.552
...as well as insubordination and misconduct.

42:12.429 --> 42:15.125
How do you respond to these allegations,
Agent Mulder?

42:16.233 --> 42:19.999
Over a dozen men lost their lives, and you
want me to respond to issues of protocol?

42:20.070 --> 42:25.201
- You failed to obtain proper authorization.
- Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.

42:25.276 --> 42:29.372
- And violated a Federal Quarantine Area...
- A cover-up was under way!

42:29.446 --> 42:33.041
Exposing yourself and possibly others
to toxic contamination.

42:33.150 --> 42:35.277
Toxic contamination! We back in that?

42:35.386 --> 42:38.184
You read my report.
Explain Fenig's disappearance.

42:38.255 --> 42:42.851
- Your report is not the subject of this inquiry.
- I have further evidence!

42:42.960 --> 42:47.693
X-rays of Mr Fenig when institutionalized
show an object lodged in his cerebellum.

42:47.831 --> 42:49.890
That is irrelevant, Agent Mulder.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.436
The man was abducted.
We all know it. Everybody here knows it!

42:54.371 --> 42:57.397
Colonel Henderson's
written testimony states

42:57.474 --> 43:01.433
that Fenig's body was found
two hours later in a cargo container.

43:06.450 --> 43:08.509
Then what can I say?

43:10.120 --> 43:13.988
How can I disprove lies
that are stamped with an official seal?

43:14.058 --> 43:16.526
That will be all, Mr Mulder.

43:18.262 --> 43:21.823
You can deny all the things I have seen,
all the things I have discovered,

43:21.899 --> 43:23.799
but not for much longer.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.900
Cos too many others
know what's happening out there.

43:27.004 --> 43:29.404
And no one,

43:29.473 --> 43:33.307
no government agency
has jurisdiction over the truth.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.543
Why did you countermand our decision?

44:07.645 --> 44:12.776
Mulder's conduct was in clear violation, not
only of Bureau procedures, but of federal law.

44:12.883 --> 44:14.316
Yes.

44:14.385 --> 44:18.185
I don't understand.
The committee's case was airtight.

44:18.288 --> 44:21.257
You ruined our last chance to get rid of him.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.589
I appreciate your frustration,

44:23.694 --> 44:27.721
but you and I both know
that Mulder's work -

44:27.865 --> 44:30.356
his singular passion -

44:30.467 --> 44:32.958
poses a most unique dilemma.

44:34.271 --> 44:39.504
But his occasional insubordination
is, in the end, far less dangerous.

44:39.576 --> 44:42.568
With respect, sir, less dangerous than what?

44:42.680 --> 44:46.548
Than having him expose
to the wrong people
