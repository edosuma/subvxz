WEBVTT

00:11.112 --> 00:13.579
There is a dead dude...

00:13.714 --> 00:16.314
he is freaking out.

00:16.384 --> 00:19.985
There was a force
that smashed my face

00:20.054 --> 00:22.287
I'm sorry.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.289
It is trying to kill us.

00:24.325 --> 00:27.526
She had been hit multiple
times in the head.

00:27.628 --> 00:30.595
I'm seeing, like,
flesh being, like, opened.

00:30.664 --> 00:34.199
Somebody is going to die
in this house.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.803
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

00:37.872 --> 00:41.440
Panic...
Panic...
Panic.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.642
My name, Amy Allen.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.310
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.212
The house just feels bad.

00:47.214 --> 00:49.882
I see dead people.

00:50.017 --> 00:53.986
This man is completely insane.

00:54.088 --> 00:57.122
I speak to dead people.

00:57.224 --> 00:59.424
Okay,
she doesn't like it in there.

00:59.427 --> 01:00.959
And they speak to me.

01:01.028 --> 01:04.196
He likes to twist that knife.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.632
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:06.734 --> 01:11.069
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.538
I rely on my partner,
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:13.607 --> 01:15.808
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:15.910 --> 01:17.576
Now, does he die right there
on the spot?

01:17.711 --> 01:21.112
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:21.148 --> 01:23.949
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:24.084 --> 01:25.851
It's my job to reveal them.

01:25.853 --> 01:27.686
Did you ever get touched like
that again?

01:27.821 --> 01:30.188
But Steve and I never speak.

01:30.257 --> 01:32.390
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.625
Until the very end.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.160
I'm as stunned as you guys are.

01:35.262 --> 01:37.863
When we uncover if it's safe
for you to stay...

01:37.932 --> 01:39.731
I don't want anything to
happen to my daughter.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.833
Or time to get out.

01:41.902 --> 01:43.902
His goal is to kill you guys.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:58.018 --> 01:59.951
I'm out here in
Marshalltown, Iowa

02:00.020 --> 02:01.587
It's about an hour
outside of Des Moines.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.056
I got a call from a
woman named Kelly.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.959
Now, she sounded pretty
bad, but get this-

02:07.061 --> 02:10.729
Her and her husband
are both professional
paranormal investigators.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.832
Now, you'd think they
wouldn't need our help,

02:13.901 --> 02:16.101
but Kelly says she's in
way over her head.

02:16.203 --> 02:18.504
Whatever is in that house
is going to

02:18.606 --> 02:20.873
take one of them out
unless we can do something fast.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.846
Before Amy arrives I look for
any leading information--

02:27.915 --> 02:31.316
religious icons,
family photographs,

02:31.385 --> 02:36.121
and even medical equipment
can influence her findings

02:36.223 --> 02:41.426
so it's important to cover
or remove them all.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.229
When I'm finished the location
will be ready to tonight's walk.

02:56.677 --> 02:59.111
A lot of things that were
negative happened here.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.682
Bad things happened
with living people here

03:03.684 --> 03:05.684
and the house took it on,

03:08.088 --> 03:10.955
and the energy
that's left here

03:10.991 --> 03:13.926
is too chaotic.

03:23.003 --> 03:24.702
Kelly, it sounds like you've
got a pretty bad situation.

03:24.738 --> 03:27.239
Um, tell me what's happening.

03:27.341 --> 03:30.174
We are being physically
attacked in the house.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.843
Our health is declining.

03:31.845 --> 03:35.380
We are desperate...we need
you and Amy to help us.

03:37.384 --> 03:39.017
You have to wait a minute.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.455
Take this.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.326
I'm Sorry.

03:48.362 --> 03:52.897
Don't be sorry.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.600
You okay to go on?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.935
Yes.

03:57.004 --> 03:58.604
All right-- so Kelly,
who lives in the house?

03:58.739 --> 04:02.608
This is me, my husband Mike,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.943
and our youngest son, Chris
who is 29.

04:05.980 --> 04:07.946
Is everybody in the
house being affected?

04:08.015 --> 04:10.882
I think I'm getting the brunt
of the physical attacks.

04:10.918 --> 04:16.387
But I think Chris is
getting mentally affected.

04:16.457 --> 04:18.523
What do you mean?

04:18.524 --> 04:22.628
I've watched Chris' personality
change since we've been here.

04:22.763 --> 04:25.764
Usually he's very pleasant

04:25.833 --> 04:29.301
but sometimes
he just gets very angry.

04:29.436 --> 04:32.371
Do me a favor and give
me a run down on what you
guys are experiencing.

04:32.506 --> 04:35.440
We are hearing
disembodied voices,

04:35.476 --> 04:38.243
shadow figures
and apparitions.

04:38.312 --> 04:41.045
We're being
physically attacked,

04:41.081 --> 04:43.181
and our health
is declining.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.784
I got to address the 800
pound gorilla in the room.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.852
You guys are paranormal
investigators.

04:47.888 --> 04:50.589
Yeah.
Why can't you fix this?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.991
Every time we try
it just gets worse

04:52.993 --> 04:56.428
It's like a doctor
getting sick

04:56.497 --> 04:58.663
and not being able
to heal himself.

04:58.699 --> 05:01.666
Now, it sounds like
you're going through
a pretty tough time here.

05:01.669 --> 05:03.468
Why don't you just sell
the freaking house and leave?

05:03.504 --> 05:04.769
I don't want to give up.

05:04.771 --> 05:09.007
Every room in this house
means something to us.
Okay.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.076
I'm fearful that...

05:11.211 --> 05:14.278
that somebody
is going to die

05:14.314 --> 05:18.183
in this house.

05:18.185 --> 05:20.351
I'm sorry.

05:20.421 --> 05:22.687
Everybody needs help
once in a while, okay?

05:22.723 --> 05:24.589
We do need help.

05:30.064 --> 05:31.963
There's a lot
of dead people here

05:32.099 --> 05:34.232
who didn't necessarily
die here,

05:34.234 --> 05:36.101
so I'm thinking that someone
drawing them in

05:36.203 --> 05:38.970
leads me to believe
medium on site.

05:39.039 --> 05:43.241
Whoever is here doesn't know
how to help them.

05:43.277 --> 05:46.178
And I hear from
this living person

05:46.180 --> 05:49.414
"No time for this...too tired"

05:49.516 --> 05:51.716
This living person already
does a lot for others.

05:51.785 --> 05:55.854
It's like I can't ever
not be helping people

05:55.956 --> 05:57.456
whether living,
dead, whatever.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.530
So Kelly it's never
really good when people
take me to a staircase.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.466
So, what's going on?

06:07.568 --> 06:10.869
If I stay in this area
I get a tight pressure

06:10.871 --> 06:13.271
on the outside of my head.

06:13.307 --> 06:14.872
I know you're on
a lot of medication.

06:14.908 --> 06:16.208
You sure it's not
a side effect?

06:16.343 --> 06:18.877
I don't take any medicines that
have side effects like that.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.213
Anything else physical
happen to you?

06:21.215 --> 06:29.221
There was a force that smashed
my face into the step.

06:29.323 --> 06:31.556
One these steps right here?

06:31.658 --> 06:33.125
Yes.

06:36.363 --> 06:37.862
Geez.

06:37.931 --> 06:43.034
That is from something
smashing me into the step.

06:43.070 --> 06:46.037
This is pretty bad.

06:46.106 --> 06:47.639
Kelly, I've got to play
devil's advocate here.

06:47.641 --> 06:49.641
You sure you didn't just
lose your balance and fall?

06:49.643 --> 06:52.244
I've fallen many times.
Okay.

06:52.379 --> 06:56.381
And there was a big difference
in the way that I fell.

06:56.516 --> 06:58.382
Anything else?

06:58.418 --> 07:01.752
I was in the refrigerator
getting a drink.

07:01.789 --> 07:02.787
Okay.

07:02.823 --> 07:04.723
It was like 3 fingers,

07:04.825 --> 07:07.325
pinched and pushed me
out of the refrigerator.

07:07.460 --> 07:11.729
It really looked like
a burn or a brand.

07:11.865 --> 07:14.332
Did it stay on your
body for a while?

07:14.401 --> 07:16.735
It did-- for 3 or 4 hours.

07:24.377 --> 07:26.611
Boy.

07:26.713 --> 07:27.813
There's a dead dude in there.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.414
He is just freaking the...out.

07:29.483 --> 07:32.383
He's moving so fast
he's literally just blurs.

07:32.452 --> 07:39.357
I think the living would be
affected by his emotional state.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.025
In what way?

07:41.094 --> 07:45.897
He could cause physical harm.
He is a cutter or a burner.

07:45.933 --> 07:50.035
He likes to hit people in
the head to cause headaches.

07:50.170 --> 07:53.905
He puts off all of these
different emotions.

07:54.007 --> 07:59.044
Extreme agitation,
outbursts of violence.

08:00.681 --> 08:04.950
Mostly anger--
that feeling doesn't really
go away here, and it's scary.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.860
Steve, I need to sit down.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.862
Go ahead...
you okay?

08:17.865 --> 08:19.664
There you go.

08:19.733 --> 08:22.234
Comfortable?
Mmhm.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.801
So, what's going on in here.

08:23.837 --> 08:28.006
I've seen a black shadow figure.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.574
Describe the black figure
for me.

08:30.611 --> 08:33.745
No arms, no legs,
no eyes, no facial - nothing

08:33.880 --> 08:35.947
And I could see through it.

08:36.015 --> 08:39.884
And as soon as I looked at it
and made eye contact with it,

08:39.886 --> 08:41.486
it went away.

08:41.554 --> 08:43.187
Anything else?

08:43.323 --> 08:46.224
When I'm laying in bed

08:46.359 --> 08:49.761
the sheets get tugged on
and pulled off the bed.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.496
How the hell are you
sleeping at night?

08:51.498 --> 08:52.664
I don't.

08:52.766 --> 08:56.701
If it's not tugging
on the sheets or the bedspread

08:56.703 --> 08:59.170
it's poking me
and pinching me,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.839
and tapping on the bottom
of the bed.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.842
It's constant--
all night long.

09:04.912 --> 09:08.713
Do you think those
investigations that you do

09:08.782 --> 09:10.715
maybe you brought
something here?

09:10.717 --> 09:12.383
It is possible.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.453
That something is
trying to communicate
with me in this house.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.323
With all this going on, how the
hell are you handling it?

09:18.325 --> 09:20.325
I'm not handling it.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.460
The stress and the
anxiety are overwhelming

09:22.529 --> 09:26.531
That's why
I need you guys here.
Okay.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.536
Medium is in here.

09:32.572 --> 09:35.006
It is a female...

09:35.075 --> 09:38.410
It gets very bad
in here sometimes.

09:38.545 --> 09:43.214
This is like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.786
There's a bunch
of random dead that

09:47.788 --> 09:51.689
try to come in here, and so
that causes stress and chaos.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.293
They hear things--
they see things.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.629
What kind of specific
experiences might they have?

09:57.764 --> 10:00.898
I think that they would hear
many people talking
at the same time.

10:00.968 --> 10:05.503
They would feel many
people in the room

10:05.638 --> 10:08.172
if not even see some of them.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.442
Feel their bed being shaken.

10:10.577 --> 10:16.314
I think that most nights this
person doesn't get any sleep

10:16.449 --> 10:19.717
I think this person has tried
to ignore her abilities.

10:19.786 --> 10:21.786
What's going to happen
to this medium

10:21.788 --> 10:23.121
if they don't deal
with their abilities?

10:23.256 --> 10:25.656
It can lead to panic attacks.

10:25.658 --> 10:29.660
The person can get, like,
violently ill and start producig
vomiting,

10:29.696 --> 10:33.331
and the heart
can be affected.

10:37.504 --> 10:38.903
I don't like this.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.656
So Mike, I was talking
to your wife earlier

10:58.792 --> 11:00.658
and she told me some horrible
things that she's going through.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.259
Yes.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.794
You must be worried about her.

11:03.830 --> 11:05.630
Very much worried--
she's scared.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.332
She's being terrorized
in her own home,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.066
and there's nothing I can do.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.503
So Mike, I know you're
part of the paranormal team.

11:11.505 --> 11:12.803
What's your role in it?

11:12.839 --> 11:16.541
I videotape-- I also help
to review the evidence,

11:16.676 --> 11:19.477
and try and decide
whether it's legitimate

11:19.513 --> 11:21.612
paranormal activity
or can it be debunked.

11:21.648 --> 11:24.082
So, have you had experiences
in the house?

11:24.151 --> 11:27.685
There's some things that
happened that I don't
have explanations for.

11:27.721 --> 11:28.820
Okay, like what?

11:28.922 --> 11:30.221
I was scratched once.

11:30.290 --> 11:32.090
You have a dog.
Yes.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.758
All right. Is it possible
the dog could have did it?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.426
I don't think
that's a possibility.

11:35.495 --> 11:37.795
Okay so, you've been scratched,
anything else?

11:37.831 --> 11:41.766
There's an attic door
that's about 6 to 8 feet away
from our bedroom door,

11:41.901 --> 11:43.768
and occasionally it would just

11:43.903 --> 11:46.037
kind of creep open on its own.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.706
Activity got to be
to the point where

11:48.842 --> 11:51.042
I finally just kind of put
a latch on the door
so it would stay shut.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.778
Do you think you guys
maybe brought something
from an investigation?

11:53.913 --> 11:55.780
I think it's possible.

11:55.782 --> 11:57.648
So, what if Amy does tell you
you guys gotta leave?

11:57.684 --> 12:00.985
I don't want to leave--
we love this house.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.988
I'm going to push Amy
to give us some other options.

12:03.990 --> 12:05.290
We want to fight--
we want to stay.

12:12.298 --> 12:14.465
There's a dead lady
who is all in black.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.001
This is her house

12:17.003 --> 12:21.139
She is pretending that
she has a life here.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.707
Does she do anything
to the living?

12:22.842 --> 12:25.943
The living here
would hear conversations

12:25.979 --> 12:27.879
her walking around.

12:27.981 --> 12:32.983
They would hear her laughing,
crying, yelling.

12:33.019 --> 12:35.019
The lady that's all in black--

12:35.055 --> 12:38.790
she likes this area.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.826
So, I think the living would
see, like, all this blackness.

12:44.297 --> 12:47.365
There's a threat I think she
feels it's a male

12:47.367 --> 12:49.100
that's the threat.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.037
I think she might have
issues with males in general.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.439
She is pretty aggressive.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.476
She is trying to keep people
away so she can be bad

12:58.545 --> 13:00.512
and be killing people.

13:07.721 --> 13:09.253
So Chris, I was talking
to your mom earlier.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.788
She's convinced that your
personality has changed.

13:10.924 --> 13:12.857
Do you agree with that at all?

13:12.926 --> 13:14.992
I think theirs have.

13:14.994 --> 13:17.595
Okay, so you think that your
parents are the ones
who have changed.

13:17.664 --> 13:19.463
What do you mean?

13:19.599 --> 13:20.898
They get agitated.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.834
It's always just bickering,

13:22.969 --> 13:25.503
and I can't take it anymore.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.272
That's funny because that's
what they're sayin' about you.

13:27.274 --> 13:28.873
Yeah.

13:28.875 --> 13:30.475
The paranormal activity that's
going on in the house,

13:30.477 --> 13:32.142
do you believe it's happening
to your mom?

13:32.179 --> 13:33.344
I don't disbelieve it,

13:33.380 --> 13:35.346
but I haven't experienced
any of it.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.681
You've had no experiences
at all?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.349
Nothing.
Not a single one.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.619
You're not...and trying to be
like "Nothing happens to me."

13:41.754 --> 13:44.289
No. I've been here
longer than anyone.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.157
I'm here more often
than anyone,

13:46.292 --> 13:48.026
but I've not experienced
anything.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.294
But you do believe your mom
is going through something?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.962
Yeah, I believe that.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.431
I don't know why she'd lie.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.165
You know,
talking to your mom,

13:55.202 --> 13:57.234
all she was saying was
she was worried about you.

13:57.270 --> 13:59.170
Most people should
be worried about her.

14:03.109 --> 14:06.677
The dead lady
does sleep in here.

14:06.746 --> 14:09.313
She's bothering somebody
in here-- a living person.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.515
This is not good.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.517
She's reaching down grabbing
this person

14:13.553 --> 14:16.521
and literally
sucking the life out of them.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.325
Is this living person aware of
what she's doing?

14:21.394 --> 14:23.327
Yes and no.

14:23.396 --> 14:26.997
That person thinks
that they're having

14:27.033 --> 14:30.335
a good experience with her
but its not.

14:37.344 --> 14:39.277
So Nikki, I understand you're
Kelly's daughter.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.678
Mmhm...yes.

14:40.747 --> 14:43.815
The times that you've spent
here, have you had
any experiences?

14:43.950 --> 14:45.650
Something always
follows me upstairs.

14:45.752 --> 14:47.284
I won't go up there.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.620
I feel like it will
push you down the steps.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.388
I feel that.

14:51.424 --> 14:52.824
So you feel it's a he?

14:52.826 --> 14:54.692
Yeah.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.160
Okay, anything else happen to
you while you were here?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.096
Something scratched me.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.698
It was four scratch marks
and they were about this long...

15:00.767 --> 15:02.500
and they were all red.

15:02.502 --> 15:04.001
Did they stay for a while?
Did they go away?

15:04.070 --> 15:06.637
A couple of days later I had,
like, a scab on all of them.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.908
She mentioned your
brother has changed a lot
since he's been here.

15:10.944 --> 15:12.377
Have you noticed that?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.844
Yeah.

15:13.880 --> 15:17.314
He has big outbursts,
and then he'll come
back downstairs

15:17.350 --> 15:18.716
an hour later--
he's fine.

15:18.851 --> 15:20.318
So, do you think
its something in the house
influencing him?

15:20.387 --> 15:22.786
I believe so.
He gets very angry.

15:22.822 --> 15:25.857
Your mom...she doesn't seem
too healthy

15:25.992 --> 15:27.258
and she's a young woman still.

15:27.393 --> 15:29.460
That's happened since she moved
into the house.

15:29.462 --> 15:30.929
She feels like something
in this house

15:31.064 --> 15:33.798
is going to eventually
try to kill her.

15:33.800 --> 15:36.401
I knew it was bad,
but I didn't think
it was that bad.

15:36.503 --> 15:38.535
I want her to move.

15:38.571 --> 15:42.740
I hope she understands
that she means a lot to us.

15:42.809 --> 15:44.608
I always feel like
I'm the oldest child

15:44.678 --> 15:48.012
and I need to be the one there
to protect her, and I can't.

15:48.081 --> 15:53.217
I hope you guys can help her out
and get my mom back.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.620
My kids need their
grandmother alive.

15:59.025 --> 16:01.826
This dead lady is really
fixed on the male here.

16:01.828 --> 16:05.896
Do you have any idea
what it is about this person?

16:05.898 --> 16:07.698
I think she does prefer
younger people.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.834
How would this affect them?

16:09.836 --> 16:16.507
I think it would make them
sick-- drained, depressed,

16:16.576 --> 16:22.646
and after some time would
get progressively sicker.

16:22.716 --> 16:25.783
She is weakening them, and
she is trying to kill them.

16:41.918 --> 16:42.984
So, I always start
my investigation

16:42.986 --> 16:45.052
by calling a bunch on
a bunch of the locals--

16:45.121 --> 16:46.854
cops, reporters,
genealogists.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.389
In this case, it's paid off.

16:48.491 --> 16:49.991
I'm heading over
to meet an historian

16:50.093 --> 16:53.093
who says one of the original
owners of Kelly and Mike's land

16:53.129 --> 16:55.496
was a faith healer
who is responsible

16:55.498 --> 16:57.298
for the deaths
of some of his followers.

17:03.173 --> 17:06.006
Now, you mentioned on the phone
that my client's property

17:06.041 --> 17:07.575
used to be owned
by a faith healer.

17:07.676 --> 17:09.042
Who was this guy?

17:09.178 --> 17:10.478
His name was Kendall Roberts.

17:10.480 --> 17:11.846
He was a farmer.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.048
He was married to a young woman
by the name of Angie Braddock.

17:14.183 --> 17:15.549
Okay.

17:15.684 --> 17:17.919
Somewhere in the 1880s
he became the head of

17:18.021 --> 17:20.788
the Christian Science movement
in the Marshalltown area.

17:20.857 --> 17:22.656
One of the tenants of the
Christian Science

17:22.692 --> 17:26.227
is that disease
is really a myth,

17:26.296 --> 17:33.067
so he spent his time trying
to cure people by prayer.

17:33.202 --> 17:35.369
Does he have any kind
of medical background?

17:35.438 --> 17:37.371
He has no formal
medical training.

17:37.373 --> 17:39.640
What happens is
he's so involved
in this traveling around

17:39.642 --> 17:41.843
that people started
to think of him as a doctor

17:41.978 --> 17:43.678
and referred
to him as a doctor.

17:43.813 --> 17:47.748
But, unfortunately, several
people died under his care.

17:47.784 --> 17:50.083
Does he get charged
with any kind of crime?

17:50.120 --> 17:53.454
Yes, there are three instances
where he was charged

17:53.589 --> 17:56.023
and not found guilty.

17:56.025 --> 17:57.457
Let me get this straight.

17:57.494 --> 18:00.528
This guy gets charged 3 times
for people dying under his care

18:00.663 --> 18:03.731
with this prayer stuff,
but he gets off?
Yes.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.732
So, now how's his wife
dealing with it?

18:05.769 --> 18:07.535
We have to assume
she was embarrassed.

18:07.537 --> 18:10.671
And on top of that, she has
her own personal tragedies

18:10.807 --> 18:12.773
that she has to cope with.

18:12.842 --> 18:13.875
Okay, which is what?

18:14.010 --> 18:16.410
The death of two
of her small children.

18:16.446 --> 18:18.779
One child dies in 1891,
an infant daughter.

18:18.848 --> 18:24.218
In 1896, her three year old son
dies choking on a button.

18:24.220 --> 18:25.586
Geez.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.488
Okay, when did they wind up
on my client's property?

18:27.557 --> 18:29.757
They moved in there,
I think, in 1918.

18:29.892 --> 18:31.959
They weren't there
all that long.

18:31.995 --> 18:36.430
In 1922, Angie dies in your
client's house of breast cancer.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.901
What about him?

18:40.970 --> 18:43.971
He actually dies of kidney
failure in 1923.

18:43.973 --> 18:46.006
So those prayers didn't
help him out.

18:46.075 --> 18:47.475
No.

18:52.582 --> 18:57.918
This weirdo dead lady...
she ain't so mentally sound,
this one.

18:57.954 --> 18:59.720
Can you tell me anything about
her from life?

18:59.823 --> 19:02.657
She lived here at some point.

19:02.659 --> 19:04.992
I know she was married.

19:05.028 --> 19:08.328
She drags around this dead kid
about 5 years of age,

19:08.364 --> 19:10.998
and then a dead baby
in her right arm.

19:11.100 --> 19:15.369
They died,
and she lost her mind.

19:15.438 --> 19:21.142
She had a mental breakdown

19:21.144 --> 19:23.444
I think she died
in the 20s, 1920s--

19:23.446 --> 19:25.212
Do you know how she died?

19:25.281 --> 19:27.214
I'm thinking like cancer.

19:27.283 --> 19:30.051
Yeah, this is not
a good situation.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.025
All right, so I just spoke
to a local cop, and he sounds
like a real stand up guy.

19:38.094 --> 19:39.961
He went digging through
the files for me

19:40.096 --> 19:42.964
and found two murders
that happened right near
Kelly's house.

19:49.272 --> 19:51.038
So Adrian, on the phone you
mentioned this homicide

19:51.173 --> 19:53.207
took place right near
my client's property.

19:53.342 --> 19:55.509
What can you tell me about it?

19:55.612 --> 19:57.177
The victims name
was Susan Vickers.

19:57.213 --> 19:58.512
She was 31 years old.

19:58.648 --> 20:00.514
She was a single mom
of three kids.

20:00.550 --> 20:03.918
She lived
a couple of blocks away
from your client's property.

20:03.987 --> 20:06.320
Tell me what happens the night
she gets murdered.

20:06.389 --> 20:08.456
On August 22,1980

20:08.458 --> 20:11.158
she left on foot
to the Iowa Veterans Home

20:11.261 --> 20:13.260
where she worked.

20:13.263 --> 20:15.996
She never showed up
for her 11 p.m. shift.

20:16.032 --> 20:19.900
She was found later on
that evening on the grounds

20:19.936 --> 20:22.736
of the Iowa Veterans Home
in the cemetery.

20:22.805 --> 20:25.740
I've got Susan's death
certificate right here.

20:29.846 --> 20:31.679
She had been hit multiple times
in the head.

20:31.681 --> 20:33.948
How close did this happen
to my client's property?

20:34.017 --> 20:37.851
It actually took place
about 2,200 feet
from your client's property.

20:37.887 --> 20:40.888
Did they make a collar?
Did they like anybody?
What happened?

20:40.890 --> 20:42.690
Well, they had a suspect
at the time.

20:42.825 --> 20:45.025
His name was Jerry Sumter, Jr.

20:45.061 --> 20:47.227
All right, so where's this
scumbag now?

20:47.263 --> 20:48.963
He was sentenced
to life in prison.

20:52.135 --> 20:55.870
I almost feel like there's
a beating happening.

20:55.872 --> 20:58.305
I'm getting pain,
like, here really bad.

20:58.341 --> 21:06.380
I'm feeling a female--
I'm just hearing
a woman crying and yelling.

21:06.382 --> 21:08.415
She was younger,
maybe 20s.

21:08.417 --> 21:12.586
I'm feeling impact
to the mid section.

21:12.722 --> 21:18.492
And then I'm, like, seeing,
like, flesh being, like, opened.

21:21.497 --> 21:24.665
The guy doing it to her
he had PTSD,

21:24.734 --> 21:30.804
and something was
wrong with his mind as well.

21:30.873 --> 21:33.407
I think he murdered her.

21:36.179 --> 21:38.346
All right, so tell me
about the next murder?

21:38.481 --> 21:41.415
The victim's name
is Richard Tassler,

21:41.451 --> 21:44.685
and he's a 43-year-old native
of Marshalltown.

21:44.687 --> 21:47.621
He lived a couple
of blocks away from
your client's property.

21:47.724 --> 21:50.891
He was involved
in the drug trade.

21:51.026 --> 21:53.160
All right.
So, what happened?

21:53.295 --> 21:55.629
On April 24, 1986,

21:55.698 --> 21:57.498
he's on the way to
his parents house.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.433
That's the last time
he was ever seen.

21:59.469 --> 22:00.968
Okay.
Did they ever make an arrest?

22:01.037 --> 22:02.036
Yes.

22:02.105 --> 22:04.071
His name was Joel Smitherman,

22:04.073 --> 22:08.042
and he was locally involved
in the drug trade as well,

22:08.044 --> 22:11.978
and he was also the last person
that was seen with Tassler.

22:12.015 --> 22:13.847
Did they find the body?

22:13.883 --> 22:17.785
Yes. They exhumed Tassler's body
on Smitherman's property.

22:17.854 --> 22:21.155
I've got his death certificate
here for you.

22:24.293 --> 22:25.926
All right-- multiple gun shot
wounds to the head.

22:25.995 --> 22:27.661
Okay. Does he ever get
convicted of it?

22:27.730 --> 22:30.731
Yeah. He got life in prison
and he's been

22:30.733 --> 22:32.466
in the Iowa State
Penitentiary ever since.

22:35.938 --> 22:39.773
I'm seeing a big guy
who is kinda roundish,

22:39.776 --> 22:44.545
and I would put him
probably being in his 30s.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.747
Maybe early 40s.

22:46.816 --> 22:52.086
All his clothes are really
dirty, and he was a hobo con ma.

22:52.088 --> 22:55.022
It seemed like he bought land

22:55.091 --> 22:57.157
or got land here

22:57.226 --> 23:00.828
and he was actually
trying to get his...together.

23:00.963 --> 23:03.931
and then I felt like
I was being get choked.

23:04.000 --> 23:09.437
And then I know there
was a gun in my mouth

23:09.539 --> 23:11.038
all the way
shoved in there.

23:11.107 --> 23:14.909
And then,
lights out for him.

23:14.911 --> 23:16.377
He says that
"The ground ate him."

23:19.248 --> 23:21.849
And so, I'm thinking they just
buried him on the land.

23:30.125 --> 23:32.059

23:49.162 --> 23:51.761
So far, I've got clients being
physically assaulted in a house

23:51.798 --> 23:53.497
where a faith healer lived,

23:53.566 --> 23:55.766
on a property near the site of
two grizzly murders,

23:55.868 --> 23:58.535
but I want to see
if there is anything else.

23:58.537 --> 24:02.639
Searching through old records
I find a tragic fire

24:02.708 --> 24:04.308
that took the life
of a young man.

24:04.377 --> 24:08.112
Turns out, it happened
less than a mile from
Kelly and Mike's property.

24:08.247 --> 24:11.949
So I got a genealogist looking
into his death for me,

24:12.018 --> 24:13.784
but he says there's
a lot more to the story.

24:13.886 --> 24:18.656
Turns out the victim's dad
used to own my client's
property, and get this.

24:18.658 --> 24:22.293
He also had a pretty
unforgettable run as
the mayor of the city.

24:29.669 --> 24:30.968
Well Marty, I appreciate you
looking into this death for me.

24:31.037 --> 24:32.736
What were you able to find out?

24:32.772 --> 24:34.705
Well Steve,
we're talking about

24:34.774 --> 24:36.907
a young man by the name
of Ross Ingledue.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.876
Ross was the son of a very
popular mayor here

24:38.945 --> 24:42.346
in Marshalltown by the name
of Oliver Ingledue.

24:42.448 --> 24:46.283
Steve, Mayor Ingledue
and his son Ross are just
buried right over here.

24:46.285 --> 24:49.353
So they were buried together.

24:49.455 --> 24:50.821
Yes.

24:50.823 --> 24:52.155
So, tell me about
this deadly fire.

24:52.225 --> 24:55.225
Ross was also very active
in the local fire department

24:55.294 --> 25:00.231
In 1903, he was fighting
a very large fire
in the center of town,

25:00.366 --> 25:04.634
just about a half a mile
from the property
you're talking about.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.370
Ross and his colleagues
were able to put the out,
but they suffered

25:07.406 --> 25:09.306
long-term health issues
with it?

25:09.342 --> 25:11.642
All right so with these health
effects, what happened to him?

25:11.711 --> 25:14.578
The result of the fire
was he suffered lung damage

25:14.580 --> 25:17.781
leading to tuberculosis and
passed away four years later.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.383
I have a copy of his
register of the death.

25:20.419 --> 25:22.686
All right.
So, he was a young guy?

25:22.722 --> 25:24.188
Yeah, 24 years old.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.326
Boy. There's this burning.

25:29.362 --> 25:31.662
I don't know if it's,
like, the whole place

25:31.797 --> 25:34.731
or just this person somehow.

25:34.800 --> 25:38.068
Somebody did, they did--
they died in the fire.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.105
I think it's a male.

25:41.240 --> 25:43.273
Terrible, terrible, terrible.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.809
All right. So, now the kid dies.
What happens?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.212
Well, shortly after
Ross Ingledue dies,

25:48.214 --> 25:52.282
his father Oliver Ingledue
buys your client's property

25:52.318 --> 25:55.885
and that's the same time that he
wins re-election as mayor.

25:55.922 --> 25:58.155
Steve, here's a photo
of Mayor Ingledue.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.492
All right. You mentioned
on the phone that this guy

26:01.494 --> 26:02.893
had a pretty colorful mayorship.

26:02.962 --> 26:03.761
Yes.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.130
He had his own sense
of lawmaking.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.798
A very, very corrupt individual.

26:08.834 --> 26:10.634
When you say "corruption",
what are we talking about?

26:10.703 --> 26:13.637
It was still prohibition,
and Mayor Ingledue

26:13.772 --> 26:15.572
was still
allowing alcohol to be served.

26:15.641 --> 26:19.542
So, the Feds sent an agent in
and Mayor Ingledue

26:19.578 --> 26:22.579
had that agent thrown in jail
on bogus charges.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.349
All right.
What happens to this guy?

26:25.418 --> 26:27.384
In 1923, he passed away

26:27.420 --> 26:30.554
of complications from diabetes.

26:30.623 --> 26:33.323
Here's a copy of
his death certificate.

26:33.392 --> 26:34.992
So, he died pretty young--
he was 61.

26:35.094 --> 26:37.261
Yes.

26:39.665 --> 26:41.732
I'm seeing
the blurry dead guy again.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.200
Do you have any idea
why he's here?

26:43.202 --> 26:46.937
I think he lived
here at some point.

26:47.006 --> 26:51.642
I feel like he's older,
age-wise, and definitely
didn't die well.

26:54.213 --> 27:01.552
He feels physically sick, dizzy,
panicked. I don't like him.

27:01.554 --> 27:03.954
I feel like he's bad.

27:04.023 --> 27:05.956
He had a lot of
problems, you know?

27:06.091 --> 27:07.825
I think he did bad things.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.534
I saw several disturbing
things during my walk,

27:17.603 --> 27:19.703
but, two had me
really concerned.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.206
First, the group of dead
in the master bedroom.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.641
There were a lot of dead people
in the room.

27:24.744 --> 27:27.177
They want to talk to the
living person in the bed.

27:27.246 --> 27:29.780
There's a conflict
between them.

27:29.849 --> 27:34.051
And then the living
person in the bed
is just like freaking out.

27:34.053 --> 27:38.789
Next, I describe the dead lady
tormenting the living person.

27:38.791 --> 27:43.260
I was upstairs
in a very small room

27:43.262 --> 27:47.130
and she, like,
comes from the ceiling.

27:47.199 --> 27:50.267
She kind of hangs from
the ceiling.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.469
And she also happens
to always carry around

27:52.571 --> 27:54.905
these, like, shells
of these dead children.

28:03.649 --> 28:05.548
Amy, is this what you saw?

28:05.584 --> 28:06.583
Yes.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.005
Now that Amy and
I have completed our
own investigations

28:29.075 --> 28:31.408
we're ready to reveal our
findings to each other

28:31.510 --> 28:34.277
and our clients
for the first time.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.814
So Amy, this is Kelly
and her husband, Mike.

28:36.949 --> 28:39.383
They live here with
their adult son, Chris...

28:39.518 --> 28:44.321
who is right here
in the photo.

28:44.423 --> 28:46.022
This is Nikki,
Kelly's daughter.

28:46.058 --> 28:48.224
She lives nearby.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.027
Now, these are not
our typical clients.

28:51.163 --> 28:53.430
Kelly and Mike
are professional
paranormal investigators

28:53.432 --> 28:55.765
so you can imagine
things are really bad

28:55.801 --> 28:57.834
if they couldn't fix things
themselves.

28:57.903 --> 28:59.570
That's why
they called us in for help.

28:59.572 --> 29:01.505
Now that Amy knows a little bit
about you guys

29:01.574 --> 29:02.873
I'll ask her to describe
her walk through.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.679
One of the first individuals
that I came into contact with

29:09.748 --> 29:14.852
was a male-- I would put him
in his '30s or 40s.

29:14.987 --> 29:19.323
He told me he was a
hobo and a con man.

29:19.325 --> 29:23.193
He wasn't a great person
for most of his life.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.929
But that he had been trying to
turn his life around.

29:25.965 --> 29:29.866
But, unfortunately he ended up
getting murdered.

29:29.869 --> 29:33.937
Initially, I felt that
he was being choked,

29:33.973 --> 29:37.441
and then I felt, actually,
a gun in my mouth,

29:37.576 --> 29:40.443
and then it was lights out.

29:40.479 --> 29:43.880
I believe he was buried while
he was still in his body.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.583
He said the ground ate him.

29:46.652 --> 29:49.852
So now, the guy
you're describing sounds a lot

29:49.889 --> 29:51.554
like somebody I came across
doing my research.

29:51.590 --> 29:53.624
This guys name
was Richard Tassler.

29:53.759 --> 29:55.492
He was a 43-year-old local guy.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.960
He lived a couple of blocks
from here, actually.

29:57.095 --> 30:00.363
He wasn't a hobo, but he was
definitely a con man.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.766
Tassler was involved
in the drug trade in town.

30:02.901 --> 30:06.336
On April 24, 1986
he goes missing.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.939
Four years later the cops
got an anonymous tip

30:08.941 --> 30:11.642
that Tassler was
buried on a farm
15 miles from here.

30:11.744 --> 30:15.979
And that's exactly
how they found him--
buried in the dirt.

30:16.015 --> 30:18.315
Now the farm they found him on
belonged to a guy named

30:18.384 --> 30:20.083
Joel Smitherman.

30:20.219 --> 30:21.952
Now, he was involved
in the drug trade with Tassler

30:22.087 --> 30:23.987
and they worked together.

30:23.989 --> 30:25.689
Now you said the guy
was shot in the head.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.691
That's exactly how Tassler
got killed.

30:27.760 --> 30:31.461
I have his
death certificate here.

30:31.497 --> 30:34.230
Took cops nearly 15
years to build a case

30:34.266 --> 30:38.201
on Smitherman, but in 2005
they finally convicted him,

30:38.204 --> 30:39.670
and he's in jail now.

30:39.672 --> 30:41.872
Now I managed to track down
a photo of Tassler.

30:41.974 --> 30:45.943
Any chance this could
be the guy you might have seen?

30:46.078 --> 30:49.146
I think it could be.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.581
This is really interesting.

30:54.053 --> 30:58.288
So then, I go upstairs,
and I got another guy.

30:58.423 --> 31:00.923
I called him the blurry
man because, like,

31:00.960 --> 31:03.426
literally that's
how you see him.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.829
He's super angry,
frustrated, emotional.

31:05.964 --> 31:08.632
He's, like, freaking out--
maniac.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.101
So, being around him
could affect your mood

31:11.236 --> 31:13.870
and make you feel a
little bit unstable.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.440
And that would be specifically
when he was around.

31:17.509 --> 31:21.111
And then when you're
not around him, then you're
normal again like that.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.113
Now, one of the main things
that you guys

31:23.248 --> 31:25.382
have been experiencing
are the mood changes.

31:25.451 --> 31:28.485
The mood changes are exactly
what you've described.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.388
The worst of the mood changes
are with Chris.

31:31.457 --> 31:34.124
Interesting.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.259
The scary thing,
with this guy, that I got

31:36.328 --> 31:38.528
was that he can be
extremely physical.

31:38.530 --> 31:41.798
He can hit people--
I got heads, eyes,

31:41.834 --> 31:45.135
give people headaches,
burn people and/or cut them.

31:45.270 --> 31:47.203
Both of these ladies
have been attacked.

31:47.273 --> 31:50.874
Something scratched me--
it was four scratch marks,

31:50.876 --> 31:52.475
but they were all in different
directions.

31:52.511 --> 31:53.810
I looked at it--
it was red.

31:53.945 --> 31:58.081
Tell her about the incident
with the refrigerator.

31:58.150 --> 32:01.685
I bent down into the bottom
shelf to get a soda
out of the refrigerator

32:01.820 --> 32:06.689
and something pinched me
and pushed me out
of the refrigerator,

32:06.725 --> 32:10.927
and what it left
was almost, like,
a burn or a brand mark.

32:10.963 --> 32:14.030
She mentioned something
about headaches.

32:14.099 --> 32:17.234
It's like a really tight
swimming cap...

32:17.236 --> 32:18.435
Okay.

32:18.437 --> 32:21.371
...smashing
the top of my head.

32:21.407 --> 32:24.574
Now, all the things
that we just discussed, could
this be the blurry guy?

32:24.610 --> 32:28.278
Yes.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.315
Anything else?

32:31.450 --> 32:34.384
Early on in the walk
I got that there was
a medium living in this house.

32:34.519 --> 32:40.123
The individual sleeps upstairs
in the bigger room.

32:40.159 --> 32:43.459
That's your room--
the master bedroom.
Mmhm.

32:43.495 --> 32:46.263
I walked into that room
and it was like Grand Central
Station for the dead.

32:46.265 --> 32:49.732
This person doesn't know
how to deal with their abilities

32:49.768 --> 32:51.868
so this is big problem.

32:51.904 --> 32:53.603
Now, the dead are collecting
in the bedroom

32:53.639 --> 32:56.039
and they're getting pissed.

32:56.174 --> 32:58.975
The way that I felt, like,
you would experience this

32:58.977 --> 33:01.611
would be feeling that the room
was filled with people.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.814
Possibly seeing some of them.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.349
Hearing people talking,
possibly yelling.

33:06.418 --> 33:08.351
The bed moving or shaking,

33:08.420 --> 33:11.955
and I don't think anybody would
get any real sleep up there.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.991
I mean, constant exposure
to the dead is not good.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.293
That'll make you sick.

33:17.363 --> 33:20.163
Obviously, Kelly's the
medium we're talking about.

33:20.199 --> 33:22.165
I think so, yeah.

33:22.234 --> 33:24.701
Tell Amy how your bedroom
makes you feel.

33:24.770 --> 33:28.838
Tormented in the bedroom--
I don't sleep.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.307
I'm pinched. I'm poked.

33:31.376 --> 33:35.645
I usually don't go to bed until
4 or 5 o'clock in the morning.

33:35.714 --> 33:40.217
I wake Mike up all
the time at night--
"Did you feel that?"

33:42.253 --> 33:44.321
I didn't know it was that bad.

33:47.459 --> 33:49.593
I'm scared for her.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.794
Amy, is Kelly's bedroom
always filled with dead people?

33:51.830 --> 33:53.864
Yeah.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.400
So, I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

34:14.152 --> 34:16.920
Scary. I feel things...
you know.

34:16.922 --> 34:20.524
I have asked Mike, you know,

34:20.525 --> 34:22.257
"Don't you feel
that on your leg?"

34:22.327 --> 34:24.628
I quit asking him because
he always says "No."

34:28.434 --> 34:32.636
I encountered a female and was
dressed all in black.

34:32.737 --> 34:35.972
She also carries two dead
children with her all the time.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.308
One was a baby, one was
about 5 years of age.

34:39.344 --> 34:42.879
Maybe she had an emotional
break down when they died.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.514
Like, maybe that's why she's
crazy now.

34:45.583 --> 34:49.186
And, she really feels like
this is her house.

34:49.321 --> 34:51.587
She possibly lived here
at some point.

34:51.623 --> 34:54.190
I got that she died in her 20s.

34:54.326 --> 34:57.394
The woman you're describing
sounds a lot like a woman who
used to live here.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.262
Her name was Angie Roberts.

34:59.331 --> 35:01.398
Now, she did come from
a wealthy family,

35:01.500 --> 35:03.666
and she married a local farmer
named Kendall Roberts.

35:03.735 --> 35:08.004
So, this guy thought that
illnesses was a myth and that

35:08.139 --> 35:10.006
he could heal people
with prayer.

35:10.042 --> 35:12.208
Problem was, instead of healing
people he was killing them.

35:12.277 --> 35:15.077
At least three people
died under his care,

35:15.113 --> 35:16.946
and it got him arrested three
different times.

35:16.982 --> 35:19.115
Found an article about this.

35:19.250 --> 35:24.020
Now, he was never convicted,
so he kept traveling
trying to heal people.

35:24.056 --> 35:26.689
You saw the lady that had two
dead kids with her.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.791
Angie lost two young children.

35:28.861 --> 35:31.928
She lost an infant baby in 1891,
and then

35:31.964 --> 35:36.032
her three year old died
choking on a button in 1896.

35:36.167 --> 35:41.370
Now, Angie ended up dying
in this house
of breast cancer in 1922.

35:41.406 --> 35:43.974
Here's her death certificate.

35:43.976 --> 35:47.911
Now, do you think it's
this woman Angie Roberts
that's the woman in black?

35:48.046 --> 35:49.912
I mean, it sounds like her.

35:49.948 --> 35:54.050
So, as far as this woman
is concerned, there is a lot

35:54.185 --> 35:57.854
of different ways that you could
have experiences with her.

35:57.923 --> 35:59.589
The attic is her favorite.

35:59.658 --> 36:02.325
So maybe you guys would hear her
walking around up there.

36:02.460 --> 36:06.129
Might hear her talking
crying or yelling.

36:06.264 --> 36:08.197
Possibly you might
be able to see her.

36:08.233 --> 36:11.267
I thought you would see
her a black figure or mask.

36:11.303 --> 36:13.670
Now, you mentioned
the attic, right?

36:13.805 --> 36:15.404
Yeah.

36:15.440 --> 36:16.573
I don't know if you've noticed
it, but there is a hook
on the attic door now.

36:16.708 --> 36:19.742
The door would just
open on its own,

36:19.877 --> 36:22.411
and it got to the point
where it bothered her so much

36:22.447 --> 36:25.615
that I had to put the hook on it
to keep it secure.

36:25.651 --> 36:27.350
Okay.

36:27.352 --> 36:29.752
She's very protective
of the upstairs area.

36:29.821 --> 36:33.356
What she was showing me was her
either pushing people
down the stairs

36:33.458 --> 36:36.626
or scaring people so much
they fall on their own.

36:36.628 --> 36:40.563
She did. Tell her what
happened to you, Kelly.

36:40.566 --> 36:44.367
There was an invisible force
behind me

36:44.436 --> 36:49.238
that smashed my face
into the carpet.

36:49.308 --> 36:53.209
I mean it smashed
me like a Mack truck.

36:53.245 --> 36:56.980
Here's a photo to show you what
happened to her.

36:56.982 --> 36:59.950
My goodness.

37:02.788 --> 37:06.922
Now, as far as Kelly getting
pushed could that be caused by
this woman that lived here?

37:06.959 --> 37:08.124
Yes.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.327
Did she do anything else?

37:10.462 --> 37:14.397
So, I saw her getting aggressive
with a living person

37:14.532 --> 37:17.334
and that was in the bedroom
at the top.

37:17.469 --> 37:21.604
You go to the top of the
stairs and make a right.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.005
That's Chris's bedroom.

37:23.041 --> 37:27.677
That person, if they're having
a dream or they're aware
feel good.

37:27.812 --> 37:31.214
Like, feel like this is
a positive good experience.

37:31.349 --> 37:35.551
But, in reality it's not
a good situation at all.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.221
Like, this person is actually
being attacked.

37:38.223 --> 37:41.090
Amy, one of the biggest reasons
Kelly called us in

37:41.126 --> 37:43.026
is because she's worried
about Chris.

37:43.161 --> 37:46.095
Now, these three all say that
he's become angry, depressed

37:46.164 --> 37:48.164
and withdrawn since
moving into the house.

37:48.200 --> 37:50.066
I am worried.

37:50.201 --> 37:52.502
You know, the weird thing
is when I interviewed him,

37:52.504 --> 37:55.171
he told me he had
no experiences-- nothing.

37:55.173 --> 37:59.308
So, is it possible
that Chris is having experiences
but don't know it?

37:59.378 --> 38:03.780
Yeah, sometimes
these things can happen
when people are sleeping.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.583
I saw her attacking
the person in bed,

38:06.718 --> 38:09.519
and I had a sketch done
of what I saw.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.338
What does she want?

38:28.473 --> 38:32.341
Basically, she is, like,
sucking energy from him.

38:32.411 --> 38:34.811
So draining him physically.

38:34.946 --> 38:39.415
Her goal is to make this person
sick and eventually cause death.

39:00.105 --> 39:02.171
You know Kelly,
you told me you don't like
asking anybody for help,

39:02.173 --> 39:04.607
but after what Amy told us
tonight, it's a good thing
you did.

39:04.742 --> 39:08.678
Now we know the problem isn't
just the house, it's also you.

39:08.747 --> 39:12.949
So now, for the big question--
is there anyway to fix it

39:13.018 --> 39:16.185
so you guys
can stay here safely
as a family

39:16.187 --> 39:18.421
or do you need to pack up
and get out while you can?

39:18.490 --> 39:21.091
For that answer I'm gonna turn
it over to Amy.

39:26.131 --> 39:31.333
So, the first thing is
you need to deal with the fact
that you have abilities.

39:31.369 --> 39:37.874
What I would like to see you do
is to begin seeing
a psychotherapist

39:38.009 --> 39:41.677
after you start working with
your abilities--

39:41.747 --> 39:43.979
the dead in your the room,
you're gonna start
moving them on

39:44.015 --> 39:47.049
without you even
being aware.

39:47.085 --> 39:51.053
So, should these guys cool off
with the investigations

39:51.089 --> 39:53.089
til her abilities
are taken care of?
Yes.

39:55.093 --> 39:59.596
I want my mom to

39:59.598 --> 40:01.731
work on her abilities
and do what she has to do.

40:03.468 --> 40:06.802
Okay, now...what we
are going to do about
the crazy man and hobo guy--

40:06.872 --> 40:08.938
you do need a medium.

40:08.974 --> 40:11.874
The hobo guy is going to be
really good to go.

40:11.910 --> 40:15.144
So, he'll be able to move on
rather quickly.

40:15.180 --> 40:18.481
The crazy blurry man will put up
a little bit more of a fight.

40:18.616 --> 40:23.619
Now, the crazy lady she doesn't
want to leave.

40:23.655 --> 40:26.689
Dealing with her is going to be
a little harder,

40:26.691 --> 40:29.925
so a demonologist does need
to come and deal with her

40:29.961 --> 40:33.796
because she's functioning
on that level.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.299
Once she goes,
will Chris go back
to being his old self?

40:36.301 --> 40:37.667
Definitely.

40:52.417 --> 40:53.516
Now Kelly, I gotta ask you.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.984
That's a long list
that Amy gave you.

40:55.020 --> 40:56.452
I mean, are you gonna take her
advice and do it?

40:56.587 --> 41:01.324
Absolutely. I have to
for the house-- for our family.

41:01.426 --> 41:03.759
For everything.

41:03.829 --> 41:05.594
Things will get better.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.663
You're not going to be cured,

41:07.665 --> 41:09.898
but things will be
much easier to manage.

41:09.935 --> 41:11.534
So Mike, "Mr. Debunker",

41:11.603 --> 41:13.536
what are your thoughts on
everything you've heard tonight?

41:13.671 --> 41:16.206
It's not good news,
but Amy's given us

41:16.308 --> 41:19.408
specific instructions
to fix everything.

41:19.444 --> 41:21.811
We have to do some work,
all three of us.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.280
It's all doable.

41:24.349 --> 41:26.749
Right.

41:26.751 --> 41:31.354
Having the answers
is what I've needed.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.389
Kelly and Mike have a lot of
work ahead of them,

41:33.458 --> 41:37.159
but if they contact a medium
to remove the hobo
and the blurry man,

41:37.229 --> 41:40.296
and a demonologist to
banish the lady in black,

41:40.365 --> 41:42.831
Kelly can focus
on managing her abilities

41:42.867 --> 41:45.935
and this family
can find the peace
it's been searching or.
