WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:02.536
Previously on "The Practice"...

00:02.569 --> 00:03.670
Can you tell me the crime

00:03.703 --> 00:05.305
your son's been convicted of?

00:05.338 --> 00:07.140
He's on death row
in Pennsylvania.

00:07.173 --> 00:09.576
He's to be executed
in five weeks.

00:09.610 --> 00:12.112
He was convicted of raping
and killing his girlfriend

00:12.145 --> 00:14.247
Alisa Kearns,
then killing her mother.

00:14.280 --> 00:15.481
Any DNA?

00:15.516 --> 00:18.251
They didn't do full
DNA analysis back then.

00:18.284 --> 00:20.086
This is Ellenor Frutt.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.054
Hello.

00:21.087 --> 00:23.389
She says you can do something.
Can you really?

00:23.423 --> 00:24.691
We're trying to get
the DNA test

00:24.725 --> 00:26.392
in order to prove
that he's innocent,

00:26.426 --> 00:27.528
but we can't get that test

00:27.561 --> 00:29.429
unless we prove
that he's innocent first?

00:29.462 --> 00:32.198
Right.
How the hell can that be?

00:32.232 --> 00:34.535
Can you think of anybody else
who may have wanted

00:34.568 --> 00:36.503
to harm your daughter
or your wife?

00:36.537 --> 00:39.540
They got the real killer,
Mr. Berluti.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.241
Your testimony
was especially powerful.

00:41.274 --> 00:43.810
You said that he
confessed to you.
What do you want from me?

00:43.844 --> 00:45.411
A statement saying
that you lied,

00:45.445 --> 00:46.780
that he never confessed.

00:46.813 --> 00:48.715
You can be sure it was
Stuart Donovan you saw

00:48.749 --> 00:51.685
go into that house?
It was between 11:30
and 12:00.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.587
My husband was a drunk
back then.

00:53.620 --> 00:55.756
He could've believed
it was 11:30

00:55.789 --> 00:57.558
when it may have been 9:00.

00:58.324 --> 00:59.826
While we feel the jury
in this case,

00:59.860 --> 01:02.529
given all
this new information,

01:02.563 --> 01:05.832
quite likely would have returned
with a verdict of not guilty,

01:05.866 --> 01:09.135
we are not persuaded that they
could not have reasonably

01:09.169 --> 01:11.705
returned with a "guilty"
just the same.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.474
The petitioner's request
for a DNA test

01:14.508 --> 01:16.510
is therefore denied.

01:16.543 --> 01:17.811
We are adjourned.

01:22.248 --> 01:22.983
You've got to be kidding.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.450
This is a matter
of life and death.

01:24.484 --> 01:25.886
I'm sorry.
Without an appointment,

01:25.919 --> 01:26.753
there's really--

01:26.787 --> 01:29.122
I've been trying to make
an appointment.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.658
You offered me one
of two days in July.

01:31.692 --> 01:33.827
By that time,
Stuart Donovan will be dead.

01:33.860 --> 01:36.830
Ms. Frutt, the governor
did consider your request,

01:36.863 --> 01:38.264
and as far--
I don't mean
to be rude,

01:38.298 --> 01:39.833
but I don't believe
he did

01:39.866 --> 01:41.434
because from everything
I've read about him,

01:41.467 --> 01:42.669
he's not only intelligent,

01:42.703 --> 01:44.505
but he's extremely
fair-minded,

01:44.538 --> 01:46.873
and there is no way he would
have denied this reprieve

01:46.907 --> 01:48.474
had he considered
the facts of--

01:48.509 --> 01:50.310
I assure you, he did.

01:50.343 --> 01:51.377
I'd like to hear it
from him.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.847
Ms. Mathers, I am asking
for 30 seconds of his time,

01:53.880 --> 01:55.882
and after that,
you can have me escorted out.

01:55.916 --> 01:58.351
How would this administration
run, Ms. Frutt,

01:58.384 --> 02:00.687
if we were to give 30 seconds
to every attorney

02:00.721 --> 02:04.457
who marched in here looking
to stay an execution?

02:04.490 --> 02:06.593
Actually, I think it would
run just fine.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.395
This is the second execution
in four years.

02:09.429 --> 02:10.864
One minute in four years

02:10.896 --> 02:12.866
isn't likely to cripple
his administration.

02:12.899 --> 02:15.335
I'm afraid I'll have to
ask you to leave.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.673
Could you give him
this note?

02:19.706 --> 02:21.642
I'm afraid I can't.
I'm sorry.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.611
Could you pass on
a gesture?

02:24.645 --> 02:28.448
Your 30 seconds with me
are up.

02:30.383 --> 02:32.252
(telephone rings)

02:32.519 --> 02:34.220
Since 1985,

02:34.254 --> 02:37.758
nationwide, there have been
at least 10 botched executions

02:37.791 --> 02:39.225
by lethal injection.

02:39.259 --> 02:41.762
Mr. Berluti, what is the basis
of this petition?

02:41.795 --> 02:44.364
That to subject my client
to lethal injection

02:44.397 --> 02:46.332
would amount to cruel
and unusual punishment,

02:46.366 --> 02:47.167
given the likelihood--

02:47.200 --> 02:50.504
counsel, for us to order
that DNA test,

02:50.537 --> 02:52.739
you have to show
that a reasonable jury

02:52.773 --> 02:55.475
couldn't have found
your client guilty.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.911
We went through all that
last week.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.212
We turned you down.

02:59.245 --> 03:01.347
What's changed
in the last nine days?

03:01.381 --> 03:02.949
Well, your honor,
I thought perhaps

03:02.983 --> 03:04.384
the court turned us down

03:04.417 --> 03:06.720
mainly on
the constitutional grounds.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.722
That's why we've
come back today

03:08.755 --> 03:10.957
with stronger
constitutional grounds,

03:10.991 --> 03:12.959
that being
the eighth amendment--

03:12.993 --> 03:14.528
cruel and unusual punishment.

03:14.561 --> 03:16.730
The petition is denied,

03:16.763 --> 03:19.733
and defense counsel
is fined $1,000.

03:19.766 --> 03:21.735
We're adjourned.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.369
(bangs gavel)

03:23.403 --> 03:24.671
Wait a second.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.673
We're trying to save
an innocent man

03:26.707 --> 03:27.674
from being put to death,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.710
and you're fining me now
$1,000?

03:29.743 --> 03:34.314
I am, sir.
You're here with nothing new,

03:34.347 --> 03:36.382
taking up the time
of a district attorney,

03:36.416 --> 03:38.251
three federal judges,
not to mention

03:38.284 --> 03:39.953
all the court employees.

03:39.986 --> 03:42.422
And the fine is going up
to $1,500

03:42.455 --> 03:43.724
if you say another word.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.559
Suppose the tubes close
like they have in the past.

03:45.592 --> 03:47.628
I'm not entitled to be
concerned about that?

03:47.661 --> 03:49.563
The court will allow counsel

03:49.596 --> 03:52.899
to inspect
the executioner's equipment.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.768
The fine is now $1,500.

03:58.338 --> 04:00.240
(music playing)

05:01.034 --> 05:02.569
Okay, great, thank you.

05:06.039 --> 05:09.442
Okay, Lucy, Joel Bullock,
prison informant,

05:09.475 --> 05:13.379
supposedly Earl Taylor's mentor,
taught him everything he knows.

05:13.413 --> 05:14.781
I'd like you to go and see
if you can find out

05:14.815 --> 05:17.050
how Earl learned
the details of the crime.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.484
You want me
to meet with him?

05:18.519 --> 05:21.121
Evidently, he has a thing
for young girls.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.990
Forget it.
You will be separated
by a partition.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.892
You just have to go
and talk to him.

05:25.926 --> 05:26.860
Do I have to?

05:27.761 --> 05:28.895
No...

05:30.430 --> 05:31.832
but you might be
our best shot.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.400
EUGENE: The clothes.

05:35.135 --> 05:36.637
Excuse me?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.705
Alisa Kearns was raped
and killed

05:38.739 --> 05:39.673
while wearing a nightshirt.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.575
ELLENOR: So?

05:41.608 --> 05:44.477
So, there's nothing in here
about it ever being tested.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.480
All the semen samples came
from the rape kit swab.

05:47.514 --> 05:48.615
So what?

05:48.649 --> 05:50.617
Well, the rape kit
was introduced at trial.

05:50.651 --> 05:52.418
That's why they're saying
it's not new evidence.

05:52.452 --> 05:54.721
The nightshirt--
that was never introduced.

05:54.755 --> 05:57.524
We can make the argument
that would be new evidence.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.525
It was never tested.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.626
Maybe there's
something on it.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.763
Where would
the nightshirt be?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.139
She probably went
to the coroner with it.

06:23.116 --> 06:24.751
We sent it
to the mortuary.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.620
The nightshirt?

06:26.653 --> 06:27.854
That's what it says.

06:29.055 --> 06:31.558
The father of the victim
requested that we send it

06:31.592 --> 06:33.827
along with the body
to the mortuary.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.829
Why the hell
would he request that?

06:35.862 --> 06:36.930
Kearns...

06:39.566 --> 06:40.734
he must be Jewish.

06:41.768 --> 06:43.036
What?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.806
It's an ancient
Jewish custom--

06:45.839 --> 06:48.742
let the victim
of a violent crime be buried

06:48.775 --> 06:50.644
in the clothes they died in.

06:50.677 --> 06:52.813
It's thought to arouse
compassion in god

06:52.846 --> 06:54.781
and hasten the end
of the exile.

06:56.082 --> 06:57.183
Really?

06:58.184 --> 06:59.853
She was buried
in the nightshirt.

07:00.787 --> 07:01.955
It's in the coffin.

07:11.231 --> 07:13.199
(footsteps approaching)

07:20.674 --> 07:21.542
(chuckles)

07:24.811 --> 07:27.714
What are you, 15?

07:27.748 --> 07:28.849
If you could help me, sir.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.851
Stuart Donovan is scheduled
for execution

07:30.884 --> 07:31.918
the day after tomorrow--

07:31.952 --> 07:33.987
show me a little something
before we get started.

07:34.921 --> 07:35.956
Excuse me.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.660
You know, flashy, flashy,
something trashy.

07:41.227 --> 07:42.929
I am not gonna flash you.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.999
I'm told that you know
how Earl Taylor

07:46.032 --> 07:47.834
got the details
on Stuart Donovan's case.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.269
Show me one little titty.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.504
Mr. Bullock, I am here
asking you--

07:50.537 --> 07:51.872
One little titty
will speak volumes.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.540
You give, I give,
little miss.

07:53.574 --> 07:56.209
That's the way
justice works.

07:56.943 --> 07:58.845
Now, you say somebody's
life's at stake.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.948
You tell me
what you know,

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
and I'll decide
how much I show you.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.720
Booty up-front.
That's the way it works.

08:06.753 --> 08:07.588
Goodbye, Mr. Bullock.

08:07.621 --> 08:11.525
No, no, wait, wait.
Okay.

08:18.865 --> 08:20.567
He got the facts
about the murder

08:20.601 --> 08:22.202
by calling
the coroner's office,

08:22.235 --> 08:23.970
pretending to be
a police officer.

08:24.004 --> 08:26.607
It ain't hard.
Most are stupid.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.909
He calls the inmate
reception center

08:28.942 --> 08:30.877
to get the skinny
on the perp,

08:30.911 --> 08:32.712
pretending to be
a bail bondsman.

08:32.746 --> 08:35.849
Next, he calls
the D. A.'S record room,

08:35.881 --> 08:38.217
posing as an assistant
district attorney.

08:39.820 --> 08:42.322
That's all you need
to find out anything

08:42.355 --> 08:43.289
about any crime.

08:43.323 --> 08:46.993
You can get all this
on the phone from prison?

08:48.161 --> 08:49.029
15 minutes.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.031
I've seen Earl
do it in less.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.600
All right, little lady,

08:54.267 --> 08:55.536
titty showtime.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.783
That's it? Stomach?

09:10.150 --> 09:11.084
Bye, Joel.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.187
I give you everything,
and you give me stomach?

09:14.955 --> 09:15.922
Man.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.259
You want to what?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.027
A court order allowing us

09:21.061 --> 09:22.729
to exhume the body
of Alisa Kearns.

09:22.763 --> 09:25.866
Your honor denied our request
to have the rape kit tested

09:25.899 --> 09:26.833
because it was old evidence.

09:26.867 --> 09:29.970
The nightshirt in the
casket is new evidence.

09:30.003 --> 09:31.872
How is it new evidence?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.306
It was no secret
Alisa Kearns

09:33.339 --> 09:35.609
was wearing a nightshirt
on the night of the crime.

09:35.642 --> 09:37.844
With due diligence,
Mr. Donovan's lawyers

09:37.878 --> 09:39.312
could have tracked it down
years ago.

09:39.345 --> 09:41.381
It was not foreseeable
that the victim

09:41.414 --> 09:43.216
would be buried
in the nightshirt she died in,

09:43.249 --> 09:45.819
in accordance with an
ancient Jewish custom.

09:45.852 --> 09:47.888
And with the existence
of the rape kit,

09:47.921 --> 09:49.923
there was never a need
to go looking for it.

09:50.857 --> 09:52.793
I would submit
that we have a right

09:52.826 --> 09:54.661
to post-conviction
discovery.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.396
Under exceptional
circumstances.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.331
Stuart Donovan is about
to be put to death.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.166
If that's not
exceptional circumstances--

10:00.200 --> 10:02.836
you don't know there's
DNA on that nightshirt.

10:02.869 --> 10:04.304
If there's not,
what are you afraid of?

10:04.337 --> 10:05.271
You still get
to execute him,

10:05.305 --> 10:07.140
and you don't have to
cancel your party plans.

10:07.173 --> 10:10.143
I direct the court to
Commonwealth vs Kivlin.

10:10.176 --> 10:13.379
The court of appeals
denied defendant's motion

10:13.413 --> 10:14.314
for exhumation

10:14.347 --> 10:16.216
because the existence
of the evidence sought

10:16.249 --> 10:18.118
was speculative
and uncertain.

10:18.151 --> 10:21.387
Kivlin involved looking
for trace gunpowder residue.

10:21.421 --> 10:22.856
That's nowhere near

10:22.889 --> 10:24.725
the scientific certainty
of DNA.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.694
Your honor,
this crosses a line.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.996
They're looking
to desecrate a grave

10:30.030 --> 10:32.365
and victimize Ms. Kearns
yet one more time.

10:32.398 --> 10:33.867
I object to that.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.268
I'd also like to point out

10:35.301 --> 10:37.103
that the prosecution
of Stuart Donovan

10:37.137 --> 10:40.440
has now cost the taxpayers
over $1 million.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.409
They had a trial.
They had an appeal.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.046
They have since gone on
to the state Supreme Court,

10:46.079 --> 10:48.749
the federal circuit court.
They've come back to you twice.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.884
They've gone to
the United States Supreme Court.

10:50.917 --> 10:52.719
For every one
of these hail Marys,

10:52.753 --> 10:54.855
the district attorney's office
must file briefs.

10:54.888 --> 10:55.889
We must show up.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.825
We're now going on 13 years.
We're over $1 million.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.761
Now they come in
looking to dig up the victim.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.729
Where in God's name
does it stop?

11:02.763 --> 11:05.031
With one simple DNA test.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.032
All right.

11:07.367 --> 11:11.204
The nightshirt may very well
be new evidence,

11:11.237 --> 11:12.973
but there's no offer
before me

11:13.006 --> 11:16.009
that it even contains
any DNA evidence,

11:16.042 --> 11:17.711
much less exculpatory.

11:17.744 --> 11:20.080
Because nobody looked.

11:20.113 --> 11:24.017
Even so, under Kivlin,
I can't reopen on speculation,

11:24.050 --> 11:26.720
and that's all
you're barking with.

11:27.420 --> 11:28.822
Your motion is denied.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.338
We're still trying.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.473
Lucy got some information
on Earl Taylor,

11:47.508 --> 11:49.142
how he gets his information,

11:50.877 --> 11:54.280
and we're going to go
to Mr. Kearns tomorrow.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.349
He can authorize us
to dig up the body.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.051
Why would any father agree

11:58.084 --> 11:59.720
to let his daughter
get dug up?

12:04.390 --> 12:05.325
It's over.

12:07.961 --> 12:08.962
Not yet.

12:10.163 --> 12:12.032
Where's my mother
off crying now?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.135
She's at home.

12:31.017 --> 12:32.519
I never believed
it would happen.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.056
Even when I got sentenced,

12:36.089 --> 12:39.526
I figured,
you know, it's a mistake.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.460
It'll get cleared up,

12:40.493 --> 12:41.461
but...

12:44.397 --> 12:45.498
we're there.

12:48.869 --> 12:50.170
The day is here.

12:55.308 --> 12:59.813
Jimmy and Eugene are going
to go look at the equipment.

12:59.846 --> 13:02.248
It's only been used once
in the past four years,

13:02.282 --> 13:05.118
so maybe
if they could find...

13:26.573 --> 13:29.409
why don't we just go
and dig up the body ourselves?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.376
We can't do that.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.112
Why, because it's a crime?

13:32.145 --> 13:34.114
I'll serve the time

13:34.147 --> 13:36.216
if I get DNA
that'll clear my son.

13:36.249 --> 13:38.051
We can't do that, Mary.

13:39.620 --> 13:41.321
Listen, it's probably
not a bad idea

13:41.354 --> 13:43.323
for you to go with Jimmy
to see the father.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.391
A mother's agony...

13:48.562 --> 13:50.096
Does he know you're coming?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.568
He doesn't know what
I'm coming to ask him.

13:54.601 --> 13:57.971
Eugene, I guess you should
check the execution equipment.

13:58.004 --> 13:58.872
Who knows?

14:06.613 --> 14:07.514
You okay?

14:11.284 --> 14:12.285
I'm fine.

14:16.322 --> 14:17.323
I'm fine.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.969
How did you expect me
to respond, Mr. Berluti?

14:30.704 --> 14:31.872
Terrible.

14:33.674 --> 14:34.608
According to the mortician,

14:35.676 --> 14:39.279
the nightshirt was folded
and put in the casket.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.516
We wouldn't have to touch
the remains of your daughter.

14:45.351 --> 14:48.121
I can't believe I'm sitting
in my own living room

14:48.154 --> 14:49.255
listening...

14:51.257 --> 14:52.659
Mr. Kearns,

14:52.693 --> 14:54.928
you and I
have never spoken.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.364
We both lost our children
that night--

14:58.398 --> 15:01.101
Mrs. Donovan, you and I
have nothing in common.

15:03.504 --> 15:07.273
If there's DNA that matches
up with my son,

15:08.308 --> 15:10.276
I will drop
any further appeal.

15:10.310 --> 15:12.012
You're asking me...

15:14.314 --> 15:16.717
to dig up
my own daughter's grave.

15:16.750 --> 15:19.052
Mr. Kearns, I would think

15:19.085 --> 15:21.988
a father would want
to know for sure.

15:22.022 --> 15:26.727
Oh, you would think that,
would you, Mr. Berluti?

15:26.760 --> 15:31.097
You won't get closure
unless you're sure.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.367
You put that nightshirt
in the casket

15:34.400 --> 15:37.137
asking for God's compassion.

15:38.605 --> 15:43.009
The compassion
we're asking for is yours.

15:48.481 --> 15:52.719
Please...
I'm begging you.

16:04.765 --> 16:06.166
What will you do?

16:09.235 --> 16:10.270
Just open the lid,

16:11.037 --> 16:12.172
take the nightshirt,

16:13.206 --> 16:15.241
and put her right back
in the ground.

16:33.259 --> 16:34.294
This way.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.466
All set?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.635
Ready.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.736
Commence
with the execution.

16:53.379 --> 16:57.417
On the count of 3.
1, 2, 3.

17:27.513 --> 17:28.481
Done.

17:29.650 --> 17:30.817
Okay, let's start
from the top.

17:30.851 --> 17:32.085
This time we'll do it

17:32.118 --> 17:33.419
as if the condemned
was struggling.

17:42.495 --> 17:43.530
Frutt.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.400
F.r.u.t.t.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.738
Stewart Donavan,
stay of execution.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.808
Yes.

17:54.841 --> 17:57.277
Yes, I understand that
you'll get back to me.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.880
But I just want it brought
to Justice Souter's attention

17:59.913 --> 18:02.348
that the execution date
is tomorrow.

18:03.383 --> 18:04.384
Yes.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.254
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.324
Supreme court justices

18:11.357 --> 18:13.259
aren't even made aware
of these requests.

18:13.293 --> 18:15.495
Their-- their law clerks
just stamp "denied,"

18:15.529 --> 18:17.297
and then they go out
and play basketball.

18:19.199 --> 18:21.267
(telephone rings)

18:22.569 --> 18:23.537
Hello?

18:25.405 --> 18:26.573
One second, please.

18:27.808 --> 18:29.109
It's the doctor
from the lab.

18:30.544 --> 18:31.745
Dr. Dunham?

18:31.778 --> 18:32.846
Ellenor Frutt.

18:36.517 --> 18:37.417
Are you sure?

18:38.384 --> 18:39.252
Okay.

18:39.753 --> 18:40.787
Thank you.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.488
Let me discuss it here,

18:42.523 --> 18:43.857
and I will call you back.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.426
Thank you.

18:47.661 --> 18:48.862
Well?

18:48.895 --> 18:51.364
There was DNA
on the nightshirt--

18:51.397 --> 18:53.534
two semen stains.

18:54.768 --> 18:56.269
It did not match Stuart's.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.671
(sighs)

19:02.643 --> 19:04.210
Thank you, God.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.779
Thank you.
Thank you, god.

19:13.754 --> 19:16.389
ELLENOR: And we can
document chain of custody.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.459
Dr. Dunham is a DNA specialist
that your office uses,

19:19.492 --> 19:21.895
so, you're certainly aware
of his credentials.

19:22.763 --> 19:23.764
Wow.

19:23.797 --> 19:27.233
I'm hoping we can now offer
a joint recommendation

19:27.267 --> 19:29.202
asking for Stuart Donovan's
release.

19:29.235 --> 19:32.539
Well, I'm not sure
I can do that.

19:32.573 --> 19:35.241
Well, you now have
conclusive proof

19:35.275 --> 19:36.309
he didn't do it.

19:36.342 --> 19:39.212
Did Dr. Dunham put this
into the national data bank?

19:39.245 --> 19:41.214
He did.
There's been no I. D.

19:45.586 --> 19:47.654
Look,
I'm not going to pretend

19:47.688 --> 19:48.922
I'm not shocked here.

19:48.955 --> 19:53.326
Obviously, this comes
as quite a surprise,

19:53.359 --> 19:57.598
but it doesn't clear
Stuart Donovan.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.500
It only means somebody else
could've been there

20:00.534 --> 20:01.802
with him that night.

20:01.835 --> 20:02.769
What?

20:02.803 --> 20:05.405
Stuart Donovan was seen
going into that house.

20:05.438 --> 20:06.339
At 9:00.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.543
No, the witness said
between 11:30 and 12:00.

20:09.576 --> 20:12.278
The witness was a drunk
who saw Johnny Carson on TV

20:12.312 --> 20:14.414
and thought it was
between 11:30 and 12:00.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.749
Mr. Young, we didn't convict

20:15.782 --> 20:17.684
with semen stains
on a nightshirt.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.320
We convicted
with eyewitness testimony.

20:20.353 --> 20:21.655
We convicted
with his confession.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.423
The confession was a lie.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.859
You say so, but I don't
have any evidence of that.

20:25.892 --> 20:26.827
I don't believe
I'm hearing this.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.394
You still plan to execute?

20:28.428 --> 20:31.865
This new evidence only goes
to show somebody else

20:31.898 --> 20:34.034
could have been there
in addition to your client,

20:34.067 --> 20:36.402
or it could have been
an old stain

20:36.436 --> 20:38.739
from the day before,
the week before.

20:38.772 --> 20:40.841
It doesn't disprove
the evidence

20:40.874 --> 20:42.509
against Stuart Donovan.

20:46.713 --> 20:48.849
How could they not
let him go now?

20:48.882 --> 20:49.850
I don't understand.

20:49.883 --> 20:52.686
Come on, back to court.

20:52.719 --> 20:53.720
Federal?

20:53.754 --> 20:55.989
Common pleas.
MARY: Judge Wood?

20:56.022 --> 20:56.923
If we went to federal,

20:56.957 --> 20:57.958
they'd kick us back
to state court on this.

20:57.991 --> 21:00.827
Plus, they definitely
don't want to see me again.

21:00.861 --> 21:01.828
Judge Wood.

21:01.862 --> 21:02.896
He's all we got.

21:03.930 --> 21:04.798
ELLENOR:
Lucy, let's go.
We can't go to federal?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.833
Jimmy, see if there's
a state court law--

21:06.867 --> 21:08.068
Why judge Wood?

21:08.101 --> 21:09.536
Would you shut up?

21:18.745 --> 21:19.746
I'm sorry.

21:20.981 --> 21:21.848
It is just...

21:25.619 --> 21:26.820
I'm so sorry.

21:34.027 --> 21:37.564
Lucy, we need an affidavit
on what Joel Bullock told you.

21:37.598 --> 21:39.933
Jimmy, get a declaration
from Dr. Dunham,

21:39.966 --> 21:41.367
plus the test results.

21:41.401 --> 21:42.135
JIMMY: Done.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.937
And keep calling
the Supreme court.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.338
Harass them.

21:51.612 --> 21:53.013
You want me to argue?

21:59.452 --> 22:02.388
No, I'll do it.

22:08.729 --> 22:09.730
Mary...

22:12.132 --> 22:13.534
it's okay.

22:21.642 --> 22:22.776
Conspiracy?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.112
Now they think
it's a conspiracy?

22:26.146 --> 22:28.615
We're going into court
again in the morning.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.518
Why are they doing this?

22:32.553 --> 22:33.887
Because they're desperate

22:33.920 --> 22:37.123
to believe
they've got the right guy.

22:37.157 --> 22:39.826
Look, we've arranged
to have you transferred

22:39.860 --> 22:40.794
to the court.

22:40.827 --> 22:43.930
Your presence there
could count for something.

22:43.964 --> 22:45.666
Have we heard
from the Supreme Court?

22:47.067 --> 22:47.834
They don't seem

22:47.868 --> 22:49.970
to be returning our calls
this week.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.606
Where's Ellenor?

22:52.639 --> 22:55.141
She's working on her statement
for tomorrow's hearing.

22:55.175 --> 22:56.810
We're not giving up,
honey.

22:58.545 --> 23:01.481
Listen, if we lose,

23:02.783 --> 23:06.086
they'll be taking you directly
from court to the...

23:08.589 --> 23:09.690
the place.

23:13.226 --> 23:14.561
The place...

23:17.163 --> 23:19.032
you mean the place
where they put me to death?

23:23.169 --> 23:26.807
So, if you got people
to say goodbye to here,

23:26.840 --> 23:28.609
you'll have to do that
in the morning.

23:44.925 --> 23:46.159
Whose semen was it?

23:46.192 --> 23:48.228
We don't know.

23:48.261 --> 23:49.863
I don't think it proves
anything, Michael.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.464
There could have been
coconspirators.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.933
And they're going back
into court again?

23:52.966 --> 23:54.735
Before judge Wood.

23:55.268 --> 23:58.805
These lawyers--
they don't quit.

23:58.839 --> 24:00.541
They dug up the rape kit
on their own.

24:00.574 --> 24:03.544
They've--
they're very good, Michael.

24:03.577 --> 24:04.745
How the hell
did they get the father

24:04.778 --> 24:06.747
to agree to an exhumation?

24:06.780 --> 24:08.715
I'm telling you,
they don't quit.

24:14.187 --> 24:15.021
I'll argue.

24:15.055 --> 24:16.489
Really?

24:16.523 --> 24:18.091
This is the killer,
right?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.560
I know it is.

24:19.593 --> 24:20.460
I'll argue.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.462
We're not losing him
the day of execution.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.135
Hey.

24:29.936 --> 24:30.937
Hey.

24:36.176 --> 24:37.110
How's it going?

24:38.679 --> 24:40.180
Okay, I've just--

24:40.213 --> 24:41.314
I've got so much here.

24:41.347 --> 24:45.251
It's just I'm not sure how
to organize it all, you know,

24:45.285 --> 24:46.920
or even if I should
argue everything.

24:46.953 --> 24:49.856
Judge Wood--
he looks like--

24:51.191 --> 24:53.026
I just don't know how long
he's going to pay attention.

24:57.831 --> 24:59.199
When he first
went to prison,

25:00.801 --> 25:03.837
he kept banging his head
up against the bars.

25:03.870 --> 25:04.838
Yeah.

25:04.871 --> 25:07.908
For 38 hours
he kept banging.

25:08.909 --> 25:11.845
He said that he wouldn't stop
until somebody heard the truth,

25:12.879 --> 25:16.883
and then, they put him
on antipsychotic medication

25:16.917 --> 25:17.951
for three years...

25:20.754 --> 25:21.788
three years.

25:25.058 --> 25:27.661
Ellenor, you can't take
this thing too personally.

25:28.895 --> 25:29.796
You won't be
any good to him

25:29.830 --> 25:32.966
if you let your emotions
take over tomorrow.

25:37.270 --> 25:38.972
Maybe you should do it,
Eugene.

25:40.907 --> 25:42.275
I'm not
as ready as you are.

25:45.178 --> 25:47.848
I'm having a hard time
keeping it all sorted--

25:47.881 --> 25:49.650
my anger,
what happened to him,

25:49.683 --> 25:52.753
what truth is relevant
to this type of hearing,

25:52.786 --> 25:53.854
what's not.

26:01.394 --> 26:02.963
I can tell you one thing.

26:05.365 --> 26:07.801
I am never going to do
another death penalty case.

26:11.004 --> 26:12.338
I can't handle it.

26:17.077 --> 26:18.211
I just can't.

26:39.399 --> 26:41.835
(indistinct chatter)

27:01.321 --> 27:02.689
BAILIFF: All rise.

27:09.195 --> 27:10.330
Be seated.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.335
All right, Ms. Frutt,
here we are again.

27:15.368 --> 27:16.703
The floor is yours.

27:20.106 --> 27:22.375
May it please the court,

27:22.408 --> 27:26.112
we now have
conclusive DNA evidence

27:26.146 --> 27:28.048
establishing
it was somebody else,

27:28.081 --> 27:30.083
not Stuart Donovan,

27:30.116 --> 27:32.118
who raped Alisa Kearns
on that night.

27:32.152 --> 27:34.287
You have the reports
in front on you.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.990
You also have the affidavit
of Joel Bullock

27:37.023 --> 27:40.360
outlining exactly
how Earl Taylor learned

27:40.393 --> 27:42.162
the details of the crime,

27:42.195 --> 27:44.364
which details allowed
Earl Taylor to go

27:44.397 --> 27:47.367
to the district attorney
with the falsified confession,

27:47.400 --> 27:53.276
a confession he used to get
his own prison sentence reduced.

27:53.774 --> 27:56.142
You also have an affidavit
from his ex-wife

27:56.176 --> 27:59.045
stating that Mr. Bressler
was habitually drunk

27:59.079 --> 28:02.215
and passed out by 9:00
every night.

28:02.248 --> 28:06.887
Mr. Bressler claims
it was between 11:30 and 12:00

28:06.920 --> 28:09.756
when he saw my client enter
the victim's house,

28:09.790 --> 28:11.725
and he is basing that
on the fact

28:11.758 --> 28:14.795
that Johnny Carson
was on the television.

28:14.828 --> 28:16.462
We have also shown
by affidavit

28:16.496 --> 28:19.332
that Johnny Carson was in fact
on during prime time

28:19.365 --> 28:23.336
the night of the murders--
9:00 p. m. to 11:00 p. m.--

28:23.369 --> 28:25.972
in an anniversary special.

28:27.407 --> 28:29.242
My client was convicted

28:29.275 --> 28:32.779
on three pieces of evidence,
your honor--

28:32.813 --> 28:36.850
a confession fabricated
by a jailhouse snitch,

28:36.883 --> 28:39.920
the eyewitness testimony
of an alcoholic

28:39.953 --> 28:43.223
who was confused
as to what time it really was,

28:43.256 --> 28:45.025
and a blood-type match

28:45.058 --> 28:49.796
which has now been conclusively
disproven with DNA testing.

28:51.464 --> 28:53.066
As a matter of law,

28:53.834 --> 28:56.803
as a matter of simple justice,

28:56.837 --> 29:00.507
Stuart Donovan's conviction
must be set aside,

29:00.541 --> 29:03.844
and he must be released
immediately.

29:23.163 --> 29:24.531
Mr. Stanfield?

29:24.565 --> 29:26.967
(clears throat)

29:29.102 --> 29:31.505
we will not deny to this court

29:31.538 --> 29:34.240
we were shocked
by this DNA evidence.

29:34.274 --> 29:36.142
We then tested the rape kit

29:36.176 --> 29:37.511
and learned just 10 seconds ago

29:37.544 --> 29:40.246
it, too, did not match
Stuart Donovan.

29:42.348 --> 29:45.952
My first reaction yesterday
to the DNA discovery

29:45.986 --> 29:49.990
was that Stuart Donovan
should, in fact, be set free,

29:50.023 --> 29:53.326
but when we stop
to think about it,

29:54.528 --> 29:57.430
nothing has changed
so dramatically

29:57.463 --> 29:59.966
that it would alter
the verdict.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.235
As Ms. Frutt correctly states,

30:02.268 --> 30:05.171
Stuart Donovan was convicted
on three pieces of evidence--

30:05.205 --> 30:07.473
first, the confession.

30:07.508 --> 30:09.976
That confession still stands.

30:10.010 --> 30:12.012
It was introduced
into evidence at trial

30:12.045 --> 30:14.180
and challenged at trial.

30:14.214 --> 30:16.517
Defense isn't free
to continue challenging it

30:16.550 --> 30:18.619
after the verdict
without new evidence,

30:18.652 --> 30:20.621
and they don't have any.

30:20.654 --> 30:23.189
They can argue all they want
that it was fabricated.

30:23.223 --> 30:27.193
That argument was made at trial
and rejected by the jury.

30:27.227 --> 30:29.930
Second,
the eyewitness testimony--

30:29.963 --> 30:32.999
again,
the defense argued at trial

30:33.033 --> 30:35.068
that Mr. Bressler
must have been mistaken,

30:35.101 --> 30:36.436
but there was nothing else

30:36.469 --> 30:38.905
to controvert
that eyewitness testimony,

30:38.939 --> 30:42.008
just as there is nothing else
to controvert it today.

30:42.042 --> 30:44.578
Third, the blood match--

30:44.611 --> 30:46.580
if you look
at the court transcripts,

30:46.613 --> 30:49.516
this was never a big part
of the prosecution's case.

30:49.550 --> 30:52.152
If you review
the closing arguments,

30:52.185 --> 30:55.188
you'll see we hammered
two points--

30:55.221 --> 30:58.491
the confession
and the eyewitness testimony.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.126
Now we can all say,

31:00.160 --> 31:02.963
"I wouldn't have agreed
with the jury on those points,"

31:02.996 --> 31:06.900
but that is not
the standard for review.

31:06.933 --> 31:09.035
The question you have to ask

31:09.069 --> 31:13.106
is whether this new evidence
is of such character

31:13.139 --> 31:17.110
that a different verdict
will likely result.

31:17.143 --> 31:19.913
The answer to that is "no"

31:19.946 --> 31:22.182
because there is nothing
to disprove

31:22.215 --> 31:25.619
either the confession
or that testimony--

31:25.652 --> 31:28.989
not then, not now.

31:31.057 --> 31:31.792
All right.

31:31.825 --> 31:33.994
I'll grant you that,
Mr. Stanfield.

31:34.027 --> 31:36.530
The court has no basis
to throw out the confession

31:36.563 --> 31:38.198
or the eyewitness testimony,

31:39.432 --> 31:42.969
but this new DNA evidence--

31:43.003 --> 31:45.271
doesn't that tell us
somebody else did it?

31:45.305 --> 31:47.240
No, your honor, it tells us

31:47.273 --> 31:49.275
that somebody else
could have been there.

31:49.309 --> 31:53.179
Somebody else made love to her.
We have no time line on that.

31:53.213 --> 31:54.648
It could have been earlier,

31:54.681 --> 31:57.483
but it doesn't change
the fundamentals of our case,

31:57.518 --> 31:59.352
and let's remember this--

31:59.385 --> 32:01.487
Mr. Donovan didn't confess
to Mr. Taylor

32:01.522 --> 32:03.957
that he raped anybody

32:03.990 --> 32:05.325
or that he made love
to the victim

32:05.358 --> 32:06.292
before killing her.

32:06.326 --> 32:10.163
He confessed only
to murdering the two women.

32:10.196 --> 32:13.133
Hence, this new evidence
does nothing to undermine

32:13.166 --> 32:14.735
the veracity
of that confession.

32:14.768 --> 32:16.537
Do you still think
he did it?

32:16.570 --> 32:18.271
My personal beliefs
aren't relevant.

32:18.304 --> 32:20.541
They're relevant to me.

32:20.574 --> 32:23.276
Do you think this is the man
who killed those women?

32:23.309 --> 32:27.380
I do, your honor. He had
a heated fight with Alisa Kearns

32:27.413 --> 32:29.015
just the day before.

32:29.049 --> 32:31.317
He refused to accept
the end of the relationship.

32:31.351 --> 32:33.086
There was no sign
of a forced entry,

32:33.119 --> 32:36.022
so, the idea
of a home invasion--

32:36.056 --> 32:39.192
no fingerprints but his,
no motive for anybody else.

32:39.225 --> 32:42.428
Look, he confessed
to the crime.

32:42.462 --> 32:44.430
You don't free a man
just because it turns out

32:44.464 --> 32:47.267
that somebody else may
have been there at the time.

32:47.300 --> 32:50.571
But you have to admit
it does change things

32:50.604 --> 32:52.038
if somebody else was there.

32:52.072 --> 32:54.240
Not enough to upset a verdict.

32:54.274 --> 32:56.409
Recently,
the Texas court of appeals

32:56.442 --> 32:59.179
was faced
with this exact situation.

32:59.212 --> 33:02.315
The DNA turned out
not to match the defendant.

33:02.348 --> 33:05.185
The court refused
to grant a new trial,

33:05.218 --> 33:08.054
ruling that the DNA results
did not preclude

33:08.088 --> 33:09.656
the presence
of a coconspirator.

33:09.690 --> 33:11.592
That was the case there.

33:11.625 --> 33:13.393
It's what we have here.

33:14.595 --> 33:16.730
You have precedent.

33:16.763 --> 33:18.532
You have the verdict
of a jury.

33:20.634 --> 33:22.503
This court should honor both.

33:31.712 --> 33:33.780
You can't rest.

33:33.814 --> 33:35.015
He was good.

33:39.152 --> 33:40.621
One more minute,
your honor?

33:40.654 --> 33:41.688
Go ahead.

33:46.627 --> 33:49.262
Five weeks ago
when I took this case,

33:49.295 --> 33:52.599
I almost immediately started
getting emotional about it,

33:52.633 --> 33:55.536
and I couldn't figure out why.

33:55.569 --> 33:58.404
I don't know Stuart Donovan.

33:58.438 --> 34:02.643
I realize now that what
got to me is the reality

34:02.676 --> 34:06.613
that people don't get
fair trials in this country.

34:06.647 --> 34:08.248
They often don't.

34:08.281 --> 34:12.052
Ms. Frutt, I was the judge
on your client's trial.

34:12.652 --> 34:16.723
And I don't doubt that you did
everything right, your honor.

34:16.757 --> 34:19.259
But Stuart Donovan
had a public defender

34:19.292 --> 34:22.094
who had just finished
another capital case

34:22.128 --> 34:25.398
48 hours
before his trial began,

34:25.431 --> 34:28.668
and that public defender
wasn't ready for this one.

34:28.702 --> 34:31.538
He didn't discover a lot
of the things he could have.

34:32.272 --> 34:34.741
Defense lawyers--
especially public defenders,

34:34.775 --> 34:37.777
especially those taking
court appointments--

34:37.811 --> 34:39.478
we just don't have
enough time.

34:39.513 --> 34:42.415
We just don't have
the resources,

34:42.447 --> 34:44.685
and it's understandable.

34:44.717 --> 34:46.786
Things are bound
to fall through the cracks.

34:46.820 --> 34:49.790
How could they not?

34:49.822 --> 34:53.560
But I have a man
facing death here.

34:55.862 --> 34:58.398
Technically,
from an evidentiary standpoint,

34:58.431 --> 35:01.267
Mr. Stanfield is right.
The confession still stands.

35:01.768 --> 35:04.470
Technically,
from an evidentiary standpoint,

35:04.505 --> 35:06.640
the eyewitness testimony
is valid.

35:06.673 --> 35:09.175
The time to impeach it
would have been at trial.

35:09.209 --> 35:10.343
That never happened.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.681
Technically, the prosecution's
two big pieces of evidence

35:14.715 --> 35:17.718
still hold up...
technically.

35:18.752 --> 35:22.723
In reality,
a man is going to be executed

35:22.756 --> 35:25.158
for a crime he didn't commit.

35:26.226 --> 35:30.396
And as I have been pounding
my head up against walls,

35:30.430 --> 35:32.232
I have been continually hearing,

35:32.265 --> 35:34.367
"Ms. Frutt,
there is a system--

35:34.400 --> 35:37.370
a system of evidence
and appeals and..."

35:41.508 --> 35:45.879
The system doesn't always work,
your honor.

35:45.912 --> 35:47.614
In the last 10 years alone,

35:47.648 --> 35:51.284
over 44 people have been
released from death row

35:51.317 --> 35:53.587
for crimes they didn't commit.

35:53.620 --> 35:56.523
The system uses
jailhouse snitches

35:56.557 --> 35:58.491
who fabricate confessions.

35:58.525 --> 36:01.294
The system has police lying.

36:01.327 --> 36:05.431
The system is
very, very fallible,

36:05.465 --> 36:07.500
and maybe it is understandable.

36:07.534 --> 36:11.471
Given the enormous volume
of criminal cases today,

36:11.505 --> 36:13.907
mistakes happen, lies happen.

36:13.940 --> 36:19.179
It is a byproduct of the system
that I can almost comprehend.

36:21.782 --> 36:26.587
But what I can't fathom
is when we have the ability

36:26.620 --> 36:29.990
to find out the truth
through DNA evidence,

36:30.023 --> 36:31.224
we don't.

36:32.025 --> 36:34.895
In 48 states,
this being one of them,

36:34.928 --> 36:38.464
prisoners do not have the right
to a simple DNA test

36:38.498 --> 36:40.534
that could prove
their innocence.

36:40.567 --> 36:42.969
You wouldn't let us
have one, judge.

36:43.003 --> 36:46.239
We had to go
to the father of the victim.

36:46.272 --> 36:50.511
Miraculously, he let us
dig up his daughter.

36:50.544 --> 36:52.846
And after we did that,
did the test on our own,

36:52.879 --> 36:56.917
we pretty much proved
Stuart Donovan's innocence,

36:56.950 --> 36:59.953
and still it hasn't ended.

37:00.587 --> 37:02.823
Mr. Stanfield now gets up,

37:02.856 --> 37:05.559
changes
the prosecution's theory,

37:05.592 --> 37:07.628
and refocuses
the court's attention

37:07.661 --> 37:10.864
on eyewitness testimony
and a jailhouse informant,

37:10.897 --> 37:14.000
which everyone in this room
regards as suspect.

37:14.034 --> 37:16.402
As technically admissible

37:16.436 --> 37:19.540
as it may be
on evidentiary grounds,

37:19.573 --> 37:22.843
none of us in this room
fully believe that snitch.

37:22.876 --> 37:26.479
None of us fully trust
that eyewitness account,

37:26.513 --> 37:30.717
and a man is going to die.

37:32.318 --> 37:35.856
Is our system
about getting convictions?

37:36.557 --> 37:37.524
Is that it?

37:39.726 --> 37:41.394
My co-counsel Eugene Young

37:41.427 --> 37:43.730
told me not to take
this case personally.

37:46.366 --> 37:47.433
How can I not?

37:48.869 --> 37:50.436
How can't we all?

37:51.905 --> 37:52.939
A man...

37:56.877 --> 38:00.280
an innocent man
is going to die.

38:01.548 --> 38:02.816
As human beings,

38:03.584 --> 38:05.752
as officers of this court,

38:06.720 --> 38:10.323
as players in this system...

38:13.960 --> 38:16.530
how do we not
take that personally?

38:38.719 --> 38:42.055
I hear Ms. Frutt's frustration,
her emotion.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.660
I'd like the court
to consider it from our side

38:46.693 --> 38:48.829
and from the victim's family's.

38:48.862 --> 38:50.897
You find the person
who commits the murder,

38:50.931 --> 38:55.501
you put that person on trial,
you secure a conviction.

38:57.470 --> 38:59.773
That's not easy these days.

38:59.806 --> 39:03.744
But even when you're
lucky enough to get that far,

39:03.777 --> 39:05.879
the defense attorneys
keep coming back

39:05.912 --> 39:09.816
over and over and over again
raising constitutional claims,

39:09.850 --> 39:11.718
saying that
the previous attorneys

39:11.752 --> 39:12.686
weren't good enough.

39:12.719 --> 39:16.690
12 years they've been
coming back on this one.

39:17.190 --> 39:22.495
12 years this father,
this husband

39:22.529 --> 39:25.031
has been waiting for this
to be over,

39:25.065 --> 39:29.870
and this on a case
where the defendant confessed,

39:29.903 --> 39:33.940
this on a case where we have
eyewitness testimony.

39:33.974 --> 39:35.942
Most times,
the defense attorneys

39:35.976 --> 39:37.578
are in here trying to free
their clients

39:37.611 --> 39:39.513
on technical grounds,

39:39.546 --> 39:41.782
exalting the system
above all else.

39:41.815 --> 39:45.619
But here, where the system
has been adhered to,

39:45.652 --> 39:47.754
where the evidence
is all sound,

39:47.788 --> 39:50.857
technically,
they're in here...

39:56.462 --> 39:58.599
we have his confession
on record.

39:59.766 --> 40:02.435
The jury believed
that confession.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.874
Why don't we just
let everybody go?

40:45.979 --> 40:49.883
I am persuaded
by defense counsel's arguments

40:49.916 --> 40:51.818
that before we put
a man to death,

40:51.852 --> 40:55.756
we should be sure
of the person's guilt

40:55.789 --> 40:58.124
and not simply limit
our inquiry

40:58.158 --> 41:00.594
as to whether the trial
was technically sound

41:00.627 --> 41:02.963
from an evidentiary standpoint.

41:04.097 --> 41:05.599
That seems...

41:07.701 --> 41:09.770
so obvious.

41:09.803 --> 41:13.106
But Mr. Stanfield's contention
is also a valid one.

41:13.139 --> 41:18.679
We could keep re-evaluating
evidence ad nauseam forever.

41:18.712 --> 41:19.580
The point of a trial

41:19.613 --> 41:22.883
is to reach a final verdict
on the facts.

41:22.916 --> 41:25.986
And though it would be nice
to reconsider the confession,

41:26.019 --> 41:28.855
take a second and third look
at the testimony,

41:28.889 --> 41:33.059
if we did that for one,
we'd have to do it for all,

41:33.093 --> 41:35.128
and if we did it for all,

41:35.161 --> 41:39.666
surely the court dockets
would clog beyond repair,

41:39.700 --> 41:43.604
and there would be no justice
for anybody.

41:43.637 --> 41:46.740
Ms. Frutt,
it was the confession

41:46.773 --> 41:50.744
and the eyewitness testimony
that convicted your client.

41:50.777 --> 41:55.181
Both of these elements were
vigorously challenged at trial.

41:55.215 --> 41:56.683
And though you'd clearly like

41:56.717 --> 41:58.685
to keep on renewing
the challenge,

41:58.719 --> 42:01.555
under the law,
you don't get to,

42:01.588 --> 42:03.089
not with what
you've brought me.

42:04.825 --> 42:06.560
But, Mr. Stanfield,

42:07.093 --> 42:08.995
had you had this DNA evidence,

42:09.029 --> 42:11.732
clearly,
you would have investigated

42:11.765 --> 42:15.335
the possibility
of another suspect.

42:15.368 --> 42:16.703
You didn't.

42:18.104 --> 42:20.807
I am an old man.

42:20.841 --> 42:24.344
I look at each cigarette
as possibly my last.

42:24.377 --> 42:29.082
My last breath
won't be spent executing a man

42:29.115 --> 42:33.286
I now think
is probably innocent.

42:34.387 --> 42:35.522
The conviction is set aside.

42:35.556 --> 42:39.159
Mr. Donovan, you are free with
the apologies of this court.

42:39.192 --> 42:41.061
(bangs gavel)
Adjourned.

42:41.161 --> 42:44.330
(indistinct chatter)

42:46.867 --> 42:47.934
How about that?

42:51.905 --> 42:53.039
Yeah.

42:55.341 --> 42:56.777
LUCY: Congratulations.

42:56.810 --> 42:57.978
MARY: Thank you.

43:01.682 --> 43:05.185
(crying)

43:36.216 --> 43:39.853
(music playing)

44:02.342 --> 44:03.744
You stinker!
