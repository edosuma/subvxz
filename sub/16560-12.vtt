WEBVTT

00:00.959 --> 00:02.544
Previously on Rosewood...

00:03.253 --> 00:05.630
Some trifling bitch
took off with all your money.

00:05.714 --> 00:06.965
That is not an excuse for you

00:07.048 --> 00:09.092
to be partying your way
to an early grave.

00:09.175 --> 00:11.636
If I decide to throw my life away,
it's mine to throw.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.180
Six months in my womb,
a near-fatal C-section,

00:14.264 --> 00:16.349
and decades of sleepless nights

00:16.433 --> 00:17.434
says otherwise.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.519
You're not taking care of yourself.

00:19.602 --> 00:21.062
Just need a little time.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.148
I'm gonna be okay.

00:50.133 --> 00:51.134
My man.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.559
I'm serious, no,
let me tell you something.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.311
The truck was coming
right at us, right,

01:01.394 --> 01:02.520
bullets flying everywhere.

01:02.604 --> 01:04.272
Luckily, I had my raid vest on.

01:04.355 --> 01:06.733
Brian Williams here seems to forget

01:06.816 --> 01:09.694
that he was around the corner
in the surveillance van at the time.

01:09.778 --> 01:12.155
Okay, did I or did I not
catch the killer?

01:12.489 --> 01:13.615
- He did.
- I did.

01:13.698 --> 01:15.700
And he took a bullet to the chest
like a champ.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.162
-Like a champ! That's right.
-Pathologist mic drop. Love it.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.705
I'm glad you guys are bonding,

01:20.789 --> 01:23.833
but, Rosie, where is your own date?

01:27.045 --> 01:28.379
She's good.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.131
So, how long you and Tina
been seeing each other?

01:30.215 --> 01:31.966
-About 24 hours.
-Seriously?

01:32.050 --> 01:34.511
Rosie, you scheduled
this double date a week ago,

01:34.594 --> 01:35.637
and you brought a yesterday chick?

01:35.720 --> 01:37.013
Villa, it's not about quantity.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
It's about quality, okay?

01:39.182 --> 01:40.934
Yeah, Tina and I have been
getting to know each other

01:41.017 --> 01:43.311
on a deeply personal level.

01:43.394 --> 01:44.395
Since yesterday?

01:44.771 --> 01:46.064
Since yesterday, yeah.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.275
That's the face Annalise makes
when she's not buying it, right?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.985
There's no face!

01:51.069 --> 01:52.112
-There's a face.
-There's a face.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.571
All right, I'm gonna leave
the action to you guys.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.532
I prefer to do my work in the lab.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.951
Don't tell me you've never
been out on an investigation.

01:58.034 --> 01:59.285
-No.
-I'm tagging you in.

01:59.369 --> 02:01.538
-No one's tagging anyone.
-No, he's tagged.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.123
-He's tagged. Hey.
-The last thing we need

02:03.206 --> 02:04.958
is more of you guys
in the field, okay?

02:05.041 --> 02:07.752
One pathologist running
around Miami is bad enough.

02:07.836 --> 02:09.462
What's a pathologist?

02:17.178 --> 02:18.304
Hey.

02:21.891 --> 02:22.934
Hey.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.561
Hey, you didn't have to do all this.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.354
I just sent the e-vite

02:26.437 --> 02:29.232
and bought the beer and the hats.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.317
Thanks, Danni.
Just thanks for everything.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.361
Emilio!

02:33.903 --> 02:35.822
Why aren't you drinking?

02:35.905 --> 02:37.282
I got to get in bed soon.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.616
The moving truck
gets here at 9:00 a.m.

02:38.700 --> 02:41.077
Come on! One more hour?

02:41.161 --> 02:42.162
Please?

02:42.245 --> 02:43.913
-One more hour.
-Yeah!

02:43.997 --> 02:45.081
Hey, everybody!

02:45.415 --> 02:46.541
Listen up!

02:46.916 --> 02:50.420
Tomorrow, Emilio leaves us all
for Vegas.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.046
Now, I've known this kid

02:52.130 --> 02:55.300
since he was getting picked
last for third-grade kickball.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.012
He was terrible then.
I don't think he's any better now.

02:59.971 --> 03:00.972
But...

03:01.681 --> 03:03.349
I'm gonna miss him like hell.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.437
So, raise a glass,
because tonight we drink

03:07.520 --> 03:09.898
to Emilio's next big adventure.

04:03.785 --> 04:05.495
Hey, babe.

04:05.578 --> 04:07.205
How you like your waffles?

04:08.039 --> 04:10.375
Any way you make 'em, muchacho.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.752
-Adriancita, good morning.
-Good morning.

04:12.835 --> 04:16.339
Oh, my gosh, how nice. Thank you. Wow.

04:18.675 --> 04:19.801
Daisie.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.095
You seen my tie with the pineapples?

04:25.390 --> 04:26.724
Morning, Detective.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.937
Thought we had a schedule.

04:31.562 --> 04:33.731
-You want some, Papi?
-I lost my appetite.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.651
-Come on.
-Ma, what happened to the schedule?

04:37.026 --> 04:40.238
I'm sorry, mija.
Pero hete, he flipped the numbers.

04:40.989 --> 04:42.323
You did this? This looks delicious!

04:42.407 --> 04:43.825
Come on, Papi, just have one piece.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.159
-Come on.
-I don't want it.

04:45.243 --> 04:46.369
You all right?

04:46.452 --> 04:47.662
Yeah, why?

04:47.745 --> 04:48.871
I mean, you love waffles.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.039
They're like a food group for you.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.041
And you go for an apple.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.167
I need the fiber.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.919
-Fiber.
-That a problem?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.046
Mija, please,
he's been like this for days.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.464
I have no idea why.

04:58.548 --> 05:00.216
He doesn't tell anybody nothing.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.135
I kind of imagined breakfast
just being the two of us,

05:02.218 --> 05:04.512
-but why don't we all sit together?
-Oh, sorry.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.596
The captain just called.

05:05.680 --> 05:07.432
We got a body in Mid-Beach.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.268
And Rosie insisted
on driving me, so...

05:10.351 --> 05:11.894
Okay, wait, so, you...

05:12.562 --> 05:15.064
You put a whole schedule together
to make sure we weren't here at once?

05:15.148 --> 05:16.691
It's for your own protection.

05:16.774 --> 05:17.775
Yeah.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.319
See what I mean?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.321
So, let's all agree right now

05:21.404 --> 05:24.115
that this and that
can never happen again.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.704
So, did you have fun
vetting Adrian last night?

05:29.787 --> 05:31.622
Villa, that's not what
last night was about.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.832
Rosie, come on.

05:32.915 --> 05:35.793
I think we both know
why you're keeping an eye on Adrian.

05:35.877 --> 05:38.504
I mean, Tawnya lied to you about...

05:39.255 --> 05:41.299
well, basically everything,
so now you want to make sure

05:41.382 --> 05:42.842
what happened to you
doesn't happen to me.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.553
Well, good news is
your boy passed phase one.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.847
-Phase one?
-Yeah, the group hang.

05:47.930 --> 05:48.931
He passed.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.558
How many more phases are there?

05:51.517 --> 05:52.518
No.

05:52.852 --> 05:56.773
Yeah!

05:59.233 --> 06:00.401
Stick close by, all right?

06:00.485 --> 06:02.195
Pool maintenance guy here
called it in.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.738
No ID on the body yet.

06:04.739 --> 06:06.699
Looks like this kid put up a fight.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.494
Mucus in the throat suggests
he died from asphyxiation.

06:09.577 --> 06:10.912
He's completely dry.

06:10.995 --> 06:12.246
The trunk must be airtight.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.873
Those are scratch marks
on the inside of the trunk.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.166
He tried to claw his way out.

06:15.249 --> 06:16.626
Are you saying someone
tied this kid up

06:16.709 --> 06:18.294
and tossed him down there alive?

06:18.920 --> 06:20.755
Sadistic way to kill someone.

06:20.838 --> 06:22.256
Some kind of dander.

06:26.677 --> 06:27.929
Looks like an arrow.

06:28.012 --> 06:30.431
Maybe our killer left his mark,
some kind of calling card.

06:30.515 --> 06:33.810
That mark doesn't fit the profile
of any serial killer I've seen before.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.478
That's because our killer
didn't do it.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.729
The victim did.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.357
He used the nail of his index finger
to carve into himself.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.192
He was trying to tell us something.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.655
X-rays show all kinds
of past injuries,

06:45.738 --> 06:47.990
healed leg fractures,
chronic joint dislocations.

06:48.074 --> 06:50.368
Bone remodeling suggests
that the injuries accumulated

06:50.451 --> 06:51.661
over a long time frame.

06:51.744 --> 06:53.079
Maybe the abuse never stopped.

06:53.162 --> 06:54.622
According to
histomorphologic analysis,

06:54.705 --> 06:57.500
this facial bruising was inflicted
just before TOD.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.670
Rigor not complete suggests
that he died less than 12 hours ago.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.840
DNA under the nails matched
the vic's like you thought.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.383
No drugs or alcohol in his blood,

07:05.466 --> 07:07.802
but I found
extremely high levels of caffeine.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.721
We ran the registration of a car
that got impounded last night

07:10.805 --> 07:12.014
a block from the pool.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.183
Emilio Sanchez, 23.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.435
That is definitely our guy.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.688
Born in Miami, no family,
Overtown address.

07:18.771 --> 07:19.772
So, what do you got?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.232
There's bruising underneath the skin.

07:21.315 --> 07:24.110
Whatever Emilio was carving
in his skin, he didn't finish.

07:24.193 --> 07:26.737
-Maybe he ran out of time.
-Maybe, but that doesn't mean

07:26.821 --> 07:28.364
that we can't see...

07:32.410 --> 07:33.995
what he was trying to tell us.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.205
Any guesses what that means?

07:36.289 --> 07:38.458
Well, if this kid used
his dying breath to tell us something,

07:38.541 --> 07:40.751
I would imagine he was trying
to tell us who killed him.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.588
So, who is "K"?

07:44.380 --> 07:46.048
That's what we need to find out.

08:00.313 --> 08:03.107
I thought he was just running late.

08:03.774 --> 08:04.984
We're so sorry.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.694
Are you Emilio's girlfriend?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.613
No. Danni's with me.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.240
Emilio was my best friend.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.993
He was more like my brother
than my real brother.

08:14.076 --> 08:16.204
Hey, we're gonna
get through this, okay?

08:16.621 --> 08:17.872
It's Nathan, right?

08:17.955 --> 08:19.373
Were you and Emilio close?

08:19.457 --> 08:22.335
Not as close as Danni,
but I liked him.

08:22.418 --> 08:23.878
Emilio was a good guy.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.922
Where did you go after the party?

08:26.005 --> 08:27.757
-Home.
-Alone?

08:27.840 --> 08:28.883
With me.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.635
We just moved in together.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.762
We fell asleep on the couch.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.430
Came back here today to help him move.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.266
Is there anyone who may
have wanted Emilio dead?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.769
Maybe someone whose name
begins with the letter "K"?

08:40.144 --> 08:42.355
We found signs of abuse
on Emilio's body,

08:42.438 --> 08:45.274
recently dislocated shoulder,
bruising on the wrist and the ankles.

08:45.358 --> 08:47.527
Do you have any idea
who would be responsible for that?

08:47.610 --> 08:48.819
Abuse?

08:50.738 --> 08:52.657
No, it's not what you think.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.076
While all the other boys
were playing sports,

08:55.618 --> 08:58.037
Emilio was practicing
how to get out of

08:58.120 --> 08:59.372
straitjackets, handcuffs.

08:59.455 --> 09:01.082
He was an escape artist.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.708
With straining
and contorting his body,

09:02.792 --> 09:05.044
that would explain
the pattern of physical abuse.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.171
Emilio loved all kinds of magic.

09:07.255 --> 09:09.966
He was always working
on these amazing illusions.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.677
He finally booked a show
off the Vegas strip.

09:12.760 --> 09:13.803
He was leaving today.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.555
Was this part of his act?

09:15.638 --> 09:18.182
Emilio made that trunk himself.

09:18.266 --> 09:19.684
It's his favorite escape.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.561
What time did the party wrap up?

09:21.644 --> 09:22.645
Around 10:00.

09:23.479 --> 09:25.856
He told us all he wanted
to get a good night's sleep.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.320
Rosie, hey, I got your text.
What's up?

09:31.404 --> 09:33.990
Why would a young man
who wanted a good night sleep

09:34.073 --> 09:35.366
be mainlining caffeine?

09:35.449 --> 09:37.535
-He wouldn't.
-Exactly.

09:38.703 --> 09:40.997
I think Emilio went out
after the party that night

09:41.080 --> 09:43.624
and finally got himself into something
that he couldn't get out of.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.668
Right, okay, shouldn't you
be talking to Annalise?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.962
Nope. I am tagging you in, my man.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.463
It's time to show you
where the real juice is.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.757
Rosie, I make my reports,
and I hand them off.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.384
-That's how I like it.
-Hey.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.430
What if someone wasn't happy
Emilio was about to get his big break?

09:57.513 --> 09:59.348
You think Emilio was killed
by another magician?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.100
Well, lying is what magicians do.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.810
They spend their lives
deceiving people.

10:02.893 --> 10:04.979
Maybe a rival put him in his own trunk

10:05.062 --> 10:06.314
to try to make it look
like an accident.

10:06.397 --> 10:08.107
Or send a message.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.734
But that still wouldn't
explain the caffeine.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.611
-True.
-What are you doing here?

10:13.321 --> 10:14.238
I don't know.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.992
Excuse me. Sorry.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.288
So, Emilio was a member
of the Society for Magical Arts.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.749
I tracked down the President,
Zavier Salvas.

10:24.832 --> 10:26.626
If Emilio had a beef
with other magicians--

10:26.709 --> 10:27.960
Zavier might know who they are.

10:28.044 --> 10:29.712
And I bet one of them
starts with a "K."

10:32.381 --> 10:34.425
Emilio was a wonderful kid.

10:35.968 --> 10:36.802
How well did you know him?

10:36.886 --> 10:39.013
He was one of my
most promising proteges.

10:39.388 --> 10:40.556
Such a talent.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.809
The entire magic community
has been shaken by his death.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.228
"Community"?
How many of you guys are there?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.939
Membership in Miami alone
is several thousand.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.818
We're changing the world
one illusion at a time.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.363
How, by pulling rabbits out of a hat

10:55.446 --> 10:57.365
and sawing people in half?

10:57.865 --> 11:00.951
Magic fulfills
a fundamental human need

11:01.035 --> 11:02.703
to believe there's more
than meets the eye.

11:02.787 --> 11:05.414
And not just the magicians
doing the big shows

11:05.498 --> 11:06.957
in the fancy casinos.

11:07.041 --> 11:09.502
Illusions can happen any time...

11:12.088 --> 11:13.089
anywhere.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.715
Wow, that was cool.

11:16.884 --> 11:19.178
-What?
-Look, everybody has enemies.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.597
Are you telling me that
magicians don't get jealous?

11:22.223 --> 11:23.224
Emilio...

11:23.891 --> 11:26.977
would sometimes
report to the Society any member

11:27.061 --> 11:29.730
who broke the magician's code
by selling secrets.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.316
Some of those members actually
got kicked out as a result.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.026
Well, can you give us any names?

11:34.110 --> 11:35.194
Of course.

11:38.823 --> 11:40.408
This is the entire membership.

11:42.868 --> 11:43.994
You opened for Copperfield?

11:44.078 --> 11:45.579
I opened for a lot of big names.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.331
Emilio could have become one himself.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.041
Wow, looks like you're the real deal.

11:49.125 --> 11:51.752
They always had an ambulance
standing by for me,

11:51.836 --> 11:53.713
said my act was absolute suicide.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.673
But here I am.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.092
Hello, Kristoff Kade.

11:58.634 --> 12:01.554
Got kicked out two weeks ago.
Where can we find him?

12:01.637 --> 12:03.723
The dander that Rosie
found on Emilio's clothes,

12:03.806 --> 12:06.475
from a diamond dove,
a bird mostly found in Australia.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.602
Okay. Weird. Love it.

12:08.686 --> 12:11.147
And I just found an allergic reaction
on Emilio's arm.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.733
I'm thinking it's plant resin,
but I just don't know what kind.

12:13.816 --> 12:14.984
Hey, guys.

12:15.776 --> 12:16.902
Okay.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.824
Exterior's approximately
three and a half feet wide,

12:21.907 --> 12:24.285
two feet deep,
height of two and a half.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.412
Steel frame.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.788
Explains why it sank.

12:27.872 --> 12:29.206
What is that boy doing?

12:29.623 --> 12:31.041
I have no idea.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.002
Joints are...

12:34.920 --> 12:35.963
beautiful.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.590
Mitchie.

12:37.673 --> 12:40.134
-EMPD, they went over all of that.
-Yeah, no, I know.

12:40.217 --> 12:43.137
I just thought I'd give it
a second look with a magician's eye.

12:43.220 --> 12:45.514
-"A magician's eye"?
-Yeah.

12:45.598 --> 12:48.100
Yeah, I don't mean to brag,
but I had my own magic act

12:48.184 --> 12:50.561
as a kid in Pensacola.
It was actually a pretty big deal.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.731
That's sweet. It's very important
that children have hobbies.

12:53.814 --> 12:54.815
Don't encourage him.

12:54.899 --> 12:57.276
Well, we can rule out a magic accident
because there's no way

12:57.359 --> 12:59.403
that Emilio could've gotten
himself into the trunk

12:59.487 --> 13:01.238
and then into the pool all by himself.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.865
Sometimes, a trunk's just a trunk.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.575
No.

13:05.451 --> 13:07.203
This isn't just a trunk, you guys.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.830
It's our murder weapon.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.918
Come on, magic is about making
even the impossible seem possible.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.753
No, it's about being fooled.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.880
I can't believe
all these suckers came out.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.381
I like this one.

13:19.465 --> 13:21.383
Two, three.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.930
Now, does anyone have
a $20 bill that I can borrow?

13:26.013 --> 13:27.014
You got one?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.682
-I do.
-Hold both of your hands

13:28.766 --> 13:30.559
out flat for me.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.436
There we go.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.814
I'll put that right there.

13:34.897 --> 13:36.440
Go ahead and close them.

13:37.900 --> 13:38.984
Open.

13:40.861 --> 13:42.112
That looks like a diamond dove.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.657
I bet it'll match
the dander on Emilio.

13:46.742 --> 13:49.829
Hey, EMPD! Stop!

13:49.912 --> 13:50.913
Excuse me.

13:53.123 --> 13:54.625
Hey.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.126
I beg your pardon.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.222
You didn't think you were gonna
get away that easy, did you?

14:16.272 --> 14:18.065
Good luck getting out of those,
magic man.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.486
You think you're slick?

14:23.904 --> 14:27.032
I got your pigeon down the hall
testifying against you.

14:28.868 --> 14:32.037
First of all,
Herman is a diamond dove.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.456
You won't find another bird like him
in all of Miami,

14:34.540 --> 14:37.167
and I am one of the only magicians
with one in his act.

14:37.251 --> 14:40.296
So explain to me why his dander

14:40.379 --> 14:41.714
ended up on Emilio's shirt.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.007
It must have rubbed off.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.675
Emilio and I met last week.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.760
We wanted to make things
right before he left town.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.512
If you're so innocent, why run?

14:48.596 --> 14:51.390
Because I have 10
outstanding parking tickets,

14:51.473 --> 14:54.476
and my street permit to perform
expired last week,

14:54.560 --> 14:57.187
so I didn't want
to get slapped with a fine.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.148
Don't worry, papa.

14:59.231 --> 15:01.692
I'll make sure you get
slapped with a big, fat fine.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.485
She does not like magicians.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.612
It's heating up fast.

15:04.945 --> 15:06.196
It's time we let her cool off.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.990
You people are the worst.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.408
What do you mean "you people"?

15:09.491 --> 15:11.368
-You fancy illusionists--
-Detective.

15:11.452 --> 15:12.661
You have a phone call.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.748
Have fun with the captain.

15:15.831 --> 15:16.874
Okay.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.461
Or else your bird will be tasting
like a blend of 11 herbs and spices.

15:22.713 --> 15:23.923
She can't do that, can she?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.674
Man, when she gets hungry,
she'll eat anything.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.134
That guy really gets under my skin.

15:27.217 --> 15:29.678
I know, thinks 'cause he's captain
he knows everything.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.888
Wait.

15:30.971 --> 15:32.056
What?

15:32.139 --> 15:33.557
Yeah, what's up with you today?

15:34.308 --> 15:35.351
-Nothing.
-No "nothing,"

15:35.434 --> 15:37.937
first you skip breakfast, and then...
Isn't that your favorite tie?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.439
What, can't a guy dress sharp
and have a light breakfast

15:40.522 --> 15:42.149
without you giving him
the third degree?

15:42.232 --> 15:43.609
And all I was doing
was posting videos.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.861
Last I heard, Emilio needed cash bad

15:45.945 --> 15:47.655
and would do any gig
that he could get.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.740
Why did he scratch
the first letter of your name

15:49.823 --> 15:51.492
into his chest last night
before he died?

15:51.575 --> 15:54.078
I don't know.
Look, I was doing a show last night.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.997
I was blowing minds in Cocoa Beach.

15:59.416 --> 16:01.460
Okay, well,
unless he figured out a way

16:01.543 --> 16:03.003
to be in two places at once,

16:03.087 --> 16:05.506
if his alibi holds,
he's not our killer.

16:06.006 --> 16:08.842
-I got to take this.
-I'll dig into Emilio's financials.

16:09.510 --> 16:10.886
I'm gonna go check on that alibi.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.119
Are you sure you're okay with this?

16:35.202 --> 16:37.830
Because you were pretty
clear about no PDA at work.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.499
Sometimes, I like to break the rules,

16:40.582 --> 16:43.335
and you know we got to enjoy this

16:43.419 --> 16:44.920
while it lasts, right?

16:45.796 --> 16:49.383
I'm so...
You mean enjoy the ride, or...

16:51.135 --> 16:53.220
Yeah.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.849
I will see you later.

17:08.235 --> 17:10.154
Jose is about to confront Manuela

17:10.237 --> 17:12.990
about whether or not Roberto
is the real father of her child!

17:13.073 --> 17:14.324
Come on.

17:14.408 --> 17:15.743
What are you doing?

17:15.826 --> 17:17.536
No! What are you doing? Turn it on!

17:17.619 --> 17:18.954
-We need to talk.
-What?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.414
And I think you know why.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.749
Something you've been keeping from me?

17:21.832 --> 17:23.917
No! What? No secrets.

17:24.001 --> 17:25.919
I'm an open librito, mija.

17:26.003 --> 17:27.254
Ma, come on.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.089
I know your tells, okay?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.507
Dad taught me,

17:30.591 --> 17:33.052
how your eyebrow arches
when you're lying

17:33.135 --> 17:35.596
and your breathing slows down
when you keep a secret.

17:36.972 --> 17:40.225
Okay, your Uncle Joey
is not really your uncle, okay?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.310
He was only your father's friend.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.228
No, that's not
what I'm talking about. I...

17:43.979 --> 17:46.982
Wait, Joe, the guy I call
every year on his birthday?

17:47.066 --> 17:48.525
You don't got to call him anymore.

17:49.276 --> 17:50.694
That's really upsetting.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.571
But that's not what I'm talking about.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.615
Your boyfriend has been acting weird.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.658
It's the schedule, isn't it, right?

17:56.742 --> 17:58.285
Papi and I didn't switch the numbers.

17:58.368 --> 18:00.245
Mija, I like a soft mattress,

18:00.329 --> 18:02.414
and his mattress is hard,
so sometimes when--

18:02.498 --> 18:04.166
Stop it. Stop.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.542
Just stop it right there.

18:05.626 --> 18:07.461
Tell me what I need to know,

18:07.836 --> 18:10.839
or you're gonna find out if Roberto's
really the father on the Internet.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.382
No.

18:13.675 --> 18:16.303
I told Papi I wouldn't say anything.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.264
Okay!

18:19.348 --> 18:21.308
But you have to promise
that you will not tell him

18:21.391 --> 18:22.643
that I told you.

18:25.437 --> 18:26.980
I knew that beautiful woman
couldn't keep a secret.

18:27.064 --> 18:30.067
How could you not tell me
you applied for another captain job?

18:30.150 --> 18:33.153
Applied, that's it. It wasn't like
I was condo shopping in Palm Beach.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.488
Yeah, well, you might be soon.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.532
Well, the truth
is I got mixed feelings.

18:36.615 --> 18:37.741
Why?

18:37.825 --> 18:38.951
This is great.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.161
Hey, you deserve to be
in a Captain's chair.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.955
Being a captain is more than a job.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.289
It's who you are.

18:44.915 --> 18:46.917
And when you get that job,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.418
I'm making you take it.

18:51.547 --> 18:52.798
-Good pep talk.
-Yeah.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.508
Well, I learned from the best.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.636
And turns out you weren't
the only one keeping a secret.

18:57.719 --> 19:00.764
Two months ago, Emilio started making
huge deposits and withdrawals.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.057
I'm thinking he owed someone money.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.059
When he couldn't pay, they killed him.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.812
Kristoff's alibi checks out.

19:06.895 --> 19:07.938
Where are we on the tox?

19:08.021 --> 19:11.817
I tested Emilio's IgE antibodies
to see what caused his reaction.

19:11.900 --> 19:14.069
It's from a tree
called pachira aquatica.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.905
Fun fact, also known
as the Mexican money tree,

19:16.989 --> 19:18.615
native to Central and South America.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.243
Now, tox flagged
Emilio's oxygen levels,

19:21.326 --> 19:23.453
so I re-checked several
anatomical sites,

19:23.537 --> 19:27.291
and the oxymetric profile showed
significantly elevated oxygen levels.

19:27.374 --> 19:29.751
The question is, "How does
a guy who died of asphyxiation

19:29.835 --> 19:31.962
end up with too much oxygen
in his blood?"

19:32.045 --> 19:33.213
And don't forget too much caffeine,

19:33.297 --> 19:34.965
which Adrian agreed
did not make sense.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.341
-Let me check that out.
-You know, I hear that's not

19:36.425 --> 19:38.010
the only thing
you're checking out lately.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.262
Tell me about our new friend Adrian.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.932
So far, so good,
but I'm giving him space,

19:44.016 --> 19:45.350
just keeping it cool.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.352
Cool? Beaumont, you've never been cool

19:47.436 --> 19:49.563
about looking out for anyone you love.

19:49.646 --> 19:50.814
You're worse than mom.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.816
It is true. It's so true.

19:52.900 --> 19:55.194
Well, Adrian's a good guy,
but Villa's been through a lot,

19:55.277 --> 19:57.237
and I just want to make
sure that he's the right guy.

19:57.654 --> 20:00.365
Well, we all know
what that means, phase two.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.825
What's phase two?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.202
The one-on-one.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.663
And I know exactly where to take him.

20:11.543 --> 20:12.586
Six the hard way.

20:12.669 --> 20:14.213
-We got a winner.
-Yeah, that was the best throw.

20:14.296 --> 20:15.255
I know.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.144
-Here you are, gentlemen.
-Yes.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.312
Just here.

20:32.481 --> 20:36.026
Yeah, this Guarana is definitely
going in my top ten.

20:36.109 --> 20:37.110
You gamble?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.655
Well, I did today
when I said yes to lunch with you.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.198
-But why are we here?
-Well, you know,

20:41.281 --> 20:43.158
I just thought
we'd get to know each other better.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.035
Okay. I get it.

20:45.118 --> 20:47.496
You wanna make sure I'm the right guy
for your best friend.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.248
Are you?

20:49.957 --> 20:50.958
I want to be.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.042
I do, but, you know...

20:52.125 --> 20:53.627
I don't know.

20:53.710 --> 20:54.962
One minute, I think she's all in,

20:55.045 --> 20:56.880
the next, it's like I'm Mr. Right Now.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.715
I can't figure her out.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.426
Have you?

21:01.510 --> 21:03.428
No. That's a hard no.

21:03.512 --> 21:06.014
Actually, it's a firm, hard no.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.307
-Really?
-Have you seen those

21:07.391 --> 21:08.850
12-sided Rubik's cubes

21:08.934 --> 21:11.103
where they're all messed up,
you can never figure them out?

21:11.186 --> 21:12.688
-She's the cube?
-She's the cube.

21:18.777 --> 21:19.945
What are you doing?

21:21.029 --> 21:23.115
All right, look,
this isn't just a lunch.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.158
This is what Villa and I call
a hunch n' lunch.

21:25.242 --> 21:26.076
A what?

21:26.159 --> 21:28.078
I think that our vic came here
the night that he died.

21:28.161 --> 21:29.413
You see those poker tables?

21:29.496 --> 21:31.832
Emilio had the playing cards
just like those,

21:31.915 --> 21:33.125
and this...

21:33.208 --> 21:34.751
the elevated oxygen in here,

21:34.835 --> 21:36.712
this place got in trouble
for pumping it in

21:36.795 --> 21:38.005
so people can stay awake.

21:38.088 --> 21:39.631
And you see this pachira aquatica?

21:41.341 --> 21:43.468
Let me guess, your victim
brushed up against it,

21:43.552 --> 21:45.178
causing an allergic reaction
on his body?

21:45.262 --> 21:47.264
My man! It's good to have
a doctor in the house.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.057
You can appreciate my skills.

21:49.391 --> 21:51.018
Now, aren't you glad that
you came out into the field

21:51.101 --> 21:53.687
so you can inhale
all this high-end O2?

21:53.770 --> 21:56.356
No, but since I'm here,
I might as well make myself useful,

21:56.440 --> 21:58.191
so, what's the plan?

21:58.275 --> 21:59.526
Eyes in the sky...

21:59.901 --> 22:02.487
If Emilio was here,
they would've recorded it.

22:04.990 --> 22:06.783
Watch and learn. Excuse me, waitress.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.119
I'm sorry. I recognize
your beautiful accent.

22:09.202 --> 22:11.079
Let me guess, you are from...

22:11.163 --> 22:12.873
Florianopolis, Brazil?

22:12.956 --> 22:15.208
Good ear. Very impressive.

22:15.292 --> 22:16.418
What can I do for you, boys?

22:16.501 --> 22:19.171
Well, my friend here,
he's always wanted to see

22:19.254 --> 22:20.797
the security room in a casino.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.216
You know, his favorite movies
are Oceans 12, Oceans 13.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.678
That's adorable, but my boss says
we can't take anyone back there.

22:26.762 --> 22:27.763
Sorry.

22:43.028 --> 22:45.197
Dude, I think I get it!
This is the juice.

22:45.280 --> 22:47.115
This is the juice,
and that was impressive.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.241
That was good.

22:49.034 --> 22:50.744
Heard you boys got some questions.

22:50.827 --> 22:51.870
Let's take a walk.

22:52.496 --> 22:53.330
Relax.

22:53.413 --> 22:55.290
This is just the ups
and downs of what we do.

22:55.374 --> 22:56.583
So this is normal?

22:58.502 --> 23:02.005
No, this is usually
when Villa flashes her badge.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.427
I'll talk with each of you later.

23:08.136 --> 23:09.805
First, I need a copy
of all your surveillance

23:09.888 --> 23:11.598
-from 10:00 p.m. on.
-Got it.

23:11.681 --> 23:13.308
All the tables, poker, blackjack,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.060
baccarat, anything with cards.

23:15.143 --> 23:16.269
Get that?

23:18.021 --> 23:19.648
So, I went through all of the footage,

23:19.731 --> 23:21.691
and look who I found.

23:22.067 --> 23:25.028
Rosie was right. Emilio did go
to the casino after the party.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.488
He picked up a coffee on the way.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.572
Check this out.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.740
He's winning every hand.

23:28.824 --> 23:30.367
You see that? I know that move.

23:30.450 --> 23:31.743
He was cheating.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.870
Looks like he had company.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.916
Nathan said he was home
alone with Danni last night.

23:37.999 --> 23:39.501
We need to find out why he lied.

23:39.584 --> 23:41.336
All right, let's do this.

23:41.920 --> 23:43.422
Let's do this.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.469
Sign and date.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.346
It says you understand your rights.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.516
All Emilio and I did was talk.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.145
Then, what's wrong
with your right hook?

23:59.229 --> 24:02.357
I think it caused the bruise
on the left side of Emilio's face.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.195
That's Nathan, right?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.406
I filled him in.

24:09.489 --> 24:11.575
Danni and Emilio
were hooking up, weren't they?

24:11.658 --> 24:13.326
And you went to confront
him before he left town.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.619
I was worried about her.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.455
Worried that she'd leave with him?

24:16.538 --> 24:19.040
No, the last few weeks,
Danni's been different.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.626
She's hiding something.
I thought Emilio could help.

24:21.710 --> 24:22.711
They tell each other everything.

24:22.794 --> 24:24.921
And when he wouldn't,
you got carried away.

24:25.005 --> 24:25.964
That what happened?

24:26.047 --> 24:27.632
He told me if I wanted to know
what was going on,

24:27.716 --> 24:28.842
I'd have to ask her.

24:28.925 --> 24:32.429
I got mad, I took a swing,
but I'd never kill him.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.639
I would never do that to him.
I would never do it to her.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.183
I believe him.

24:36.266 --> 24:37.267
Me, too.

24:37.350 --> 24:39.227
This guy knew his girl's
best friend wasn't a threat.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.271
That's right.
Emilio was just protecting her.

24:41.354 --> 24:43.273
And Nathan understood that.

24:44.441 --> 24:47.402
You know, a woman
is entitled to her secrets.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.237
Just because she's your girlfriend
doesn't mean

24:49.321 --> 24:51.656
you have the right to know
every thought in her head.

24:52.073 --> 24:53.450
Emilio was leaving.

24:53.533 --> 24:56.203
He said he wanted to make sure
Danni would be okay.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.955
It wasn't his fault that
she was hiding a secret.

24:59.039 --> 25:02.542
But now he's gone,
and I can't figure her out.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.670
Maybe she doesn't feel
the same way I do.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.299
Hey...

25:09.382 --> 25:10.842
Can I borrow Rosie for a minute?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.011
I found out
where Emilio's money was going.

25:13.094 --> 25:14.888
$1,000 a month in medical bills.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.389
But Emilio's autopsy didn't show

25:16.473 --> 25:18.767
any signs of prolonged
illnesses or recent surgeries.

25:18.850 --> 25:21.228
There was nothing on there that
would indicate expensive medical care.

25:21.311 --> 25:24.439
Yeah, but if anyone knew what Emilio
was doing, I'd say it was Danni.

25:24.898 --> 25:25.899
I got to take this.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.234
Yeah?

25:33.615 --> 25:34.699
Pippy.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.994
Please, tell me you did not
lock Mitchie in that trunk.

25:38.078 --> 25:39.120
No.

25:39.204 --> 25:41.998
He gave me explicit
instructions only to open it

25:42.082 --> 25:45.252
if he hasn't found his way out
in two more minutes.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.836
What happens after two minutes?

25:47.212 --> 25:48.380
He runs out of air.

25:49.422 --> 25:51.258
Honey, you all right in there?

25:52.467 --> 25:53.635
Mitchie?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.680
Pippy, if you killed that boy...
Mitchie, answer me.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.683
-Get him out of there.
-Mitchie, you're not speaking.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.560
-How do we do this?
-I don't know, just...

26:05.689 --> 26:07.440
I knew there had to be a way out.

26:08.149 --> 26:10.402
Okay, how did you get out of there?

26:10.485 --> 26:13.154
You have no idea how flexible
the Mendelsons are.

26:13.530 --> 26:14.990
And I never want to know.

26:15.073 --> 26:16.950
I'm sorry. Did I miss something?

26:17.325 --> 26:18.368
By my calculations,

26:18.451 --> 26:20.453
someone Emilio's size and weight

26:20.537 --> 26:22.372
would use up the oxygen in this trunk

26:22.455 --> 26:23.999
in approximately five minutes.

26:24.082 --> 26:27.502
And we know that he trained himself
to hold his breath for another five.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.170
-Right, plenty of time to get out.
-Right.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.298
So, if Emilio could get out
of the trunk, then why didn't he?

26:31.381 --> 26:34.009
Something slowed him down.
We just need to figure out what.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.137
Nathan would never hurt Emilio.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.221
He's a good guy.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.432
-We know.
-We also know Emilio was paying

26:40.515 --> 26:41.933
someone's medical bills,

26:42.017 --> 26:43.643
and we need your help to find out who.

26:44.477 --> 26:45.478
You cold?

26:45.562 --> 26:46.980
I notice you're warming your hands.

26:47.063 --> 26:49.482
You were doing the same thing
at Emilio's apartment.

26:50.859 --> 26:51.860
Can I take a look?

26:52.611 --> 26:55.280
Let's see. White fingers,
shortness of breath...

26:55.697 --> 26:57.991
all symptoms of systemic sclerosis.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.369
He was paying
for your medical bills, wasn't he?

27:02.329 --> 27:03.913
Six months ago,

27:03.997 --> 27:06.041
I started having trouble swallowing.

27:06.124 --> 27:08.418
Emilio took me to my
first doctor's appointment.

27:08.501 --> 27:10.170
He was there for me every night,

27:10.253 --> 27:11.963
checked in on me every day.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.633
When the doctor told me
that there was no cure,

27:14.716 --> 27:16.301
I was devastated.

27:16.384 --> 27:18.303
Emilio wanted to cancel
his Vegas show,

27:18.386 --> 27:19.638
but I wouldn't let him.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.766
Danni, Emilio was using
his sleight of hand at poker

27:22.849 --> 27:24.142
to pay for your treatment.

27:24.684 --> 27:25.685
I had no idea.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.355
We think it's someone that
he won some money from that...

27:28.897 --> 27:30.815
I got him killed, didn't I?

27:31.399 --> 27:33.652
No, he was trying to help me.

27:33.735 --> 27:36.446
No, someone is responsible
for Emilio's death,

27:36.529 --> 27:37.781
but it is definitely not you.

27:37.864 --> 27:40.200
Any idea who would do this to him?

27:41.910 --> 27:43.328
We don't know, but...

27:43.912 --> 27:45.163
we'll find out.

27:49.751 --> 27:50.960
You got no right.

27:51.586 --> 27:53.213
-Can I help you, Detective?
-No, you can't,

27:53.296 --> 27:55.382
and even if you could,
I don't want your help.

27:55.465 --> 27:57.133
You don't think I got
eyes and ears everywhere?

27:57.217 --> 27:58.301
What are you talking about?

27:59.177 --> 28:01.388
You know, you're not as good
of a liar as you think you are.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.765
I'm talking about Palm Beach.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.310
-That's right.
-Yeah, they called me.

28:07.394 --> 28:08.436
Yeah, I know they did.

28:08.520 --> 28:09.938
I spoke with my buddy
over in homicide.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.648
He said you had some choice words.

28:11.731 --> 28:12.732
I was honest with him--

28:12.816 --> 28:15.193
You called me a wild animal,
a loose cannon.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.736
-That is not true.
-Come on, Slade.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.238
We both know how you feel about me.

28:18.321 --> 28:20.323
Ever since you came here,
you've had it out for me.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.908
You know I'm damn good at my job.

28:21.991 --> 28:23.118
-Why won't you let me go?
-Look, I...

28:24.285 --> 28:25.537
Excuse me. We got new leads.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.539
-Can you give us a second, Detective?
-Actually...

28:27.914 --> 28:29.374
I think we're done here.

28:29.457 --> 28:30.792
We got a job to do.

28:40.009 --> 28:41.344
Okay, what do we got?

28:41.428 --> 28:44.180
So, we pulled images
of everyone who lost big to Emilio.

28:44.264 --> 28:46.224
Turns out three of them have a record.

28:46.307 --> 28:48.017
Emilio just wanted to help his friend,

28:48.101 --> 28:49.936
but he sat down
with a bunch of bad people

28:50.019 --> 28:51.229
who just don't like to lose.

28:51.312 --> 28:52.689
Well, any one of them
could've figured out

28:52.772 --> 28:55.692
that Emilio was using magic
to cheat them and taking them out.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.277
So, who are they?

28:57.360 --> 28:58.778
Lukas Nilsson,

28:58.862 --> 29:01.030
runs an aircraft-manufacturing
company,

29:01.114 --> 29:02.866
wealthy family, ties to the mob,

29:02.949 --> 29:05.243
tough guy to track down,
stays off the grid.

29:05.326 --> 29:06.911
Lilly Zhukov, been living large

29:06.995 --> 29:09.122
ever since her last two husbands
died suspiciously

29:09.205 --> 29:10.373
and she inherited their wealth.

29:10.457 --> 29:12.709
Last seen talking
to Emilio before he left.

29:12.792 --> 29:15.128
Mick Furman, currently on parole.

29:15.211 --> 29:17.756
Mick did four years in Levy
for armed robbery,

29:17.839 --> 29:19.048
a natural-born cheater.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.342
Traffic cam caught him
heading toward Emilio's.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.428
Now, all three of them
are registered to attend

29:23.511 --> 29:25.138
a high-roller's weekend at the casino.

29:25.221 --> 29:27.140
I want to know any aliases
these guys go by,

29:27.223 --> 29:30.351
and, Ira, have Feldheim flag anybody
with a "K" connection, all right?

29:30.435 --> 29:31.686
The problem is these aren't
the type of people

29:31.770 --> 29:33.271
who just come in for a friendly chat.

29:33.354 --> 29:34.564
Yeah, no way. They'll lawyer up.

29:34.647 --> 29:36.649
Or they'll take off
once they know that they're POIs.

29:37.025 --> 29:38.985
Well, who says
we have to bring them in?

29:39.569 --> 29:41.070
We'll already have them in one place.

29:41.154 --> 29:43.364
We'll go around, ask questions
without them knowing,

29:43.448 --> 29:45.533
turn the casino into our own little
interrogation room.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.618
Okay.

29:46.701 --> 29:48.620
And I'll get to show off
my poker skills.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.914
-You play poker?
-A little bit.

30:02.050 --> 30:03.593
What's going on with your face?

30:03.676 --> 30:05.804
-It's my game face.
-Take it off and put it away.

30:05.887 --> 30:08.306
No can do. When it's on, it's on.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.520
Deal me in.

30:24.405 --> 30:25.448
Raise.

30:26.157 --> 30:27.700
Damn, that's my card.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.410
Raise.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.163
Go for it, baby.

30:33.623 --> 30:35.291
Okay, call.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.045
I like her.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.672
Is she yours?

30:41.089 --> 30:43.591
So long as he keeps winning, I am.

30:44.634 --> 30:46.052
I'm about to break you up.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.930
No, not tonight.
I'm feeling a little lucky.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.098
I don't believe in luck.

30:50.181 --> 30:53.518
Well, I played a kid here
last night who changed mine.

30:53.601 --> 30:55.562
-He couldn't lose.
-Oh, yeah?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.982
Yeah, I don't see him here
tonight, though.

30:59.357 --> 31:00.358
Well, don't worry.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.026
He won't be back here any time soon.

31:12.704 --> 31:14.122
Are you looking for someone?

31:15.373 --> 31:16.791
Not anymore.

31:16.875 --> 31:18.418
It must be my lucky day.

31:18.501 --> 31:19.627
What are you drinking?

31:19.711 --> 31:21.421
Manhattan. Care to join me?

31:21.504 --> 31:22.505
I would love one, yes.

31:25.216 --> 31:27.093
Thought I told you to go
check out the ex-con.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.761
Yeah, she's more my type.

31:29.721 --> 31:30.847
You guys know each other?

31:30.972 --> 31:34.142
Yeah, it's my
little brother.

31:34.225 --> 31:36.102
He's got a real problem
with authority.

31:36.185 --> 31:38.187
Hey, what can I say?
I'm a loose cannon, right,

31:38.271 --> 31:39.564
a wild animal.

31:40.064 --> 31:41.482
I like a wild one.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.194
I'm gonna buy her a drink.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.238
Yeah. Why don't you two have fun?

31:47.322 --> 31:49.240
I'm gonna go try my luck at roulette.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.586
All right, time to see
if any of our casino suspects

32:01.669 --> 32:02.670
paid Emilio a visit.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.464
So, we're looking for fingerprints,
fiber, hair,

32:04.547 --> 32:06.341
anything the CSI guys
might have missed.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.217
You know what?
I'm gonna start in the bedroom.

32:11.512 --> 32:13.514
I spotted that cheater a mile away.

32:14.641 --> 32:16.559
So, you said the kid won't be
coming back. Why not?

32:16.643 --> 32:17.685
You rat him out?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.229
You ask a lot of questions.

32:20.647 --> 32:22.523
He's a chatty one, this one.

32:23.107 --> 32:24.859
He loves to keep
the conversation flowing.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.361
I love to keep it flowing,
baby, don't I?

32:26.444 --> 32:28.196
Yeah, loves to make it last.

32:28.279 --> 32:31.866
I had an ex-wife that
tried to have me killed.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.494
But I still love her.

32:34.577 --> 32:37.205
My second husband
died tragically, too.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.582
Accident in the bedroom.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.417
You ever tie a guy up?

32:42.377 --> 32:43.878
You are a wild one.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.254
I know.

32:45.338 --> 32:47.173
But, I mean, something like that?

32:56.975 --> 32:57.976
Ouch!

32:58.559 --> 32:59.811
That's got to hurt.

33:00.520 --> 33:01.688
Place your bet.

33:02.939 --> 33:03.982
You want to know my secret?

33:04.065 --> 33:07.819
You find yourself a real loser,
and you just bet against him.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.613
They lose. I win.

33:10.697 --> 33:12.073
Yeah, we'll see about that.

33:12.156 --> 33:13.241
No more bets.

33:17.412 --> 33:18.997
Thirty five black.

33:19.914 --> 33:21.958
See? I'm telling you.
It works every time.

33:22.458 --> 33:25.545
Well, why don't you go find yourself
another table, buddy?

33:25.628 --> 33:27.255
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.342
I wanted to see how you'd react
to someone who beats you.

33:31.426 --> 33:33.678
It took you five seconds
to lay your hands on me.

33:33.761 --> 33:35.722
How long did it take you to do
the same thing to Emilio?

33:43.771 --> 33:44.856
What's going on right now?

33:44.939 --> 33:46.357
My Mitchie senses are tingling.

33:46.441 --> 33:47.442
You're acting crazy.

33:47.525 --> 33:48.568
Are you on a juice cleanse again?

33:48.651 --> 33:49.986
No, I smell almonds.

33:50.069 --> 33:52.155
Okay? People eat almonds. So?

33:52.488 --> 33:54.574
Not Emilio. He was allergic.

33:54.657 --> 33:56.951
Okay, I swabbed the kitchen.
Cupboards are empty.

34:04.584 --> 34:06.127
We need to test this cup.

34:07.545 --> 34:08.963
Well, looks like another one for me.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.048
Hey, you know what, Lukas?

34:10.131 --> 34:13.718
You got to work on your poker face,
man, your poker face.

34:16.179 --> 34:17.263
One second.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.557
Talk to me, Mitchie.

34:19.640 --> 34:20.892
How'd it go with my girl there?

34:20.975 --> 34:22.602
Well, Lilly didn't kill Emilio

34:22.685 --> 34:23.686
or her dead husbands.

34:23.770 --> 34:25.646
Truth is I think she's here
just to dull her pain.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.274
Well, and Mick's wife
confirmed his alibi.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.860
I guess we take everybody off
the table except Lukas.

34:32.028 --> 34:34.072
They found traces of cyanide
at Emilio's place.

34:34.155 --> 34:36.491
Now, to be sure he was poisoned,
I need to test that body.

34:36.574 --> 34:37.742
We don't have time for that.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.535
-Yeah!
-Well, if Villa can keep him busy,

34:39.619 --> 34:41.746
I know a guy who can be
at my lab in five minutes.

34:41.829 --> 34:42.955
-Five minutes?
-Five minutes.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.040
Okay.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.708
My man, are you
ready to run the fastest

34:45.792 --> 34:47.293
Prussian blue test in MCL history?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.669
-I'm on it.
-Let's do this.

34:48.753 --> 34:50.338
-Hi.
-Make yourself at home.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.840
If there's anything you need,
I'm here.

34:52.924 --> 34:53.925
Okay.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.894
Son, you really think
you would miss something this big?

35:04.977 --> 35:07.313
Fifty percent of the population
can't smell cyanide poisoning.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.489
Rosie, you're one of those people.

35:16.572 --> 35:18.282
My man. All right, thanks.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.329
Someone poisoned Emilio
before he got into the trunk.

35:23.412 --> 35:26.249
I don't get it. Why poison him
if you're gonna suffocate him anyway?

35:26.332 --> 35:27.500
Yeah, I know.

35:29.794 --> 35:30.837
Hey...

35:30.920 --> 35:31.921
-King.
-Rosie.

35:32.004 --> 35:34.048
Sir, you can't do that.
Get security up here now.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.633
-Rosie, what are you doing?
-Sir, you can't...

35:35.716 --> 35:36.843
-What are you...
-Security!

35:36.926 --> 35:38.302
EMPD. Back up.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.470
We've been so focused on the who,

35:39.554 --> 35:41.055
we didn't even think about where.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.306
Emilio loved cards.

35:42.390 --> 35:44.183
What if he put that "K"
over his heart for a reason?

35:44.267 --> 35:46.435
The king of hearts, the one
with the sword through his head.

35:46.519 --> 35:48.604
I think this is the "K"
that Emilio was trying to point us to.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.689
The suicide king.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.773
Suicide king.

35:55.570 --> 35:57.071
Thanks for letting us stop by so late.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.322
-Of course.
-We're hoping you can answer

35:58.406 --> 36:00.324
some questions
about Emilio's last escape.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.410
Certainly. Anything for Emilio.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.997
Good. So, he had 10 minutes to escape.

36:06.080 --> 36:07.290
That's plenty of time.

36:07.748 --> 36:08.916
So why didn't he?

36:09.000 --> 36:10.543
Well, sometimes, in our line of work,

36:10.626 --> 36:12.628
things just go wrong.

36:12.712 --> 36:14.422
-Sure.
-I'm afraid we may never know

36:14.505 --> 36:16.924
what happened during
Emilio's last moments.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.509
Well, but actually...

36:18.843 --> 36:20.261
-we do.
-We do.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.763
Histotoxic hypoxia...

36:23.222 --> 36:25.850
Emilio didn't show signs
of it during the autopsy,

36:25.933 --> 36:30.104
but that's because you gave him
just enough cyanide

36:30.188 --> 36:31.772
to inhibit his breathing.

36:32.607 --> 36:35.109
-Excuse me?
-You spent your entire life

36:35.193 --> 36:37.361
as an opening act for other magicians.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.779
And no matter what you did,

36:38.863 --> 36:40.656
you could never break through.

36:41.240 --> 36:42.783
Not like Emilio was.

36:42.867 --> 36:44.869
He was about to become a star,

36:44.952 --> 36:47.163
performing illusions
you helped him master,

36:47.246 --> 36:48.581
and that killed you.

36:48.664 --> 36:49.916
So you called him,

36:49.999 --> 36:51.375
made plans to see him before he left.

36:51.459 --> 36:53.544
You made a toast, but first,

36:54.003 --> 36:55.880
you slipped something into his drink.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.217
50% of the population,
they can't smell cyanide poisoning.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.718
I am one of those people.

37:00.801 --> 37:01.928
That's why I missed it
at the apartment.

37:02.011 --> 37:05.556
You asked Emilio to show you
his greatest escape one last time.

37:06.515 --> 37:09.352
Cyanide slows our ability
to absorb oxygen.

37:11.938 --> 37:13.731
You knew he would run out of time.

37:13.814 --> 37:16.651
Magic is all about controlling
what the audience sees.

37:16.984 --> 37:19.904
You wanted it to look like
Emilio's trick didn't work,

37:19.987 --> 37:21.364
but he got the last word.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.657
Here's a "K."

37:22.740 --> 37:24.033
"K" is for "king."

37:24.116 --> 37:26.452
Emilio could've scratched
this anywhere on his body,

37:26.535 --> 37:27.745
but where did he do it?

37:27.828 --> 37:28.996
He put it right over his heart.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.123
And the king of hearts
has another name,

37:31.207 --> 37:32.583
the suicide king.

37:35.336 --> 37:38.089
This all seems pretty far fetched,
don't you think?

37:38.172 --> 37:41.509
You know, cyanide occurs
naturally in apricot pits.

37:41.592 --> 37:44.887
And we know you can make them appear
out of thin air, can't you?

37:45.221 --> 37:46.889
You were Emilio's mentor,

37:47.348 --> 37:48.933
respected and revered...

37:50.309 --> 37:52.311
but he exposed you
for who you really are...

37:53.354 --> 37:54.563
a murderer.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.987
I hope you like being in small places
you'll never get out of.

38:06.534 --> 38:08.035
I appreciate the call.

38:08.369 --> 38:09.370
Thank you.

38:11.330 --> 38:13.457
That sounded not good.

38:14.375 --> 38:15.710
Is it about the...

38:16.210 --> 38:17.253
captain job?

38:17.336 --> 38:19.547
I think things worked out
the way they were meant to.

38:20.339 --> 38:21.340
You all right?

38:21.757 --> 38:22.758
Yeah.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.677
Besides, if I left,

38:24.760 --> 38:25.928
who would keep you in check?

38:27.763 --> 38:28.764
Right?

38:30.016 --> 38:32.226
Rosie and I are grabbing a drink.
You want to join us?

38:34.186 --> 38:35.229
Why don't you go ahead?

38:35.313 --> 38:36.314
I'll catch up.

38:43.154 --> 38:44.155
You got a minute?

38:45.406 --> 38:46.949
Chief from Palm Beach called.

38:47.408 --> 38:48.451
I got the job.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.162
Congratulations. I'm not surprised.

38:51.245 --> 38:53.289
Well, he also mentioned
you told him he'd be a fool

38:53.372 --> 38:54.999
not to hire me, so,

38:55.333 --> 38:57.043
I guess my eyes and ears were wrong,

38:57.126 --> 38:58.878
which means I owe you an apology.

38:58.961 --> 39:00.421
You know, the truth is
I did say that you were

39:00.504 --> 39:02.089
a wild animal,

39:02.173 --> 39:04.592
a lion meant to lead, not obey,

39:05.051 --> 39:06.302
a ruler of its pack.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.679
You called me a lion?

39:09.305 --> 39:11.557
Ira, I wasn't sure about
you when I first got here,

39:11.640 --> 39:13.225
but you've earned my respect.

39:13.309 --> 39:15.770
You're a good cop.
You deserve to be captain somewhere.

39:16.729 --> 39:17.938
You know, maybe now we can

39:18.022 --> 39:20.232
be a couple of Miami captains
kicking ass.

39:22.026 --> 39:23.486
I didn't take the job.

39:25.112 --> 39:26.113
Why not?

39:26.989 --> 39:28.240
It's complicated.

39:33.287 --> 39:36.040
You don't want to be a captain
somewhere else, do you?

39:37.833 --> 39:38.667
What can I say?

39:39.126 --> 39:40.503
This is my pack.

39:41.587 --> 39:42.838
It's my pack, too.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.842
See you tomorrow, Cap.

40:01.857 --> 40:03.317
Hey, you. What...

40:03.651 --> 40:05.403
What are you doing here?

40:05.486 --> 40:07.029
Something came up at Magic City,

40:07.113 --> 40:08.864
so Rosie asked me to cover for him.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.074
So I'm here.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.867
You try that Guarana?

40:12.410 --> 40:14.286
-It's not great.
-No, it's not.

40:15.204 --> 40:17.373
And that's not why you're here,

40:17.623 --> 40:18.499
is it?

40:20.668 --> 40:21.836
All right...

40:23.129 --> 40:24.004
Look...

40:24.630 --> 40:26.549
I know we're still getting
to know each other.

40:27.133 --> 40:29.009
And I don't expect you to show me
all your cards right away,

40:29.093 --> 40:31.429
but you don't talk to me.

40:31.512 --> 40:33.139
What do you want to know?

40:34.390 --> 40:36.767
My favorite food?

40:36.851 --> 40:40.187
-My favorite color?
-Tomatillo salsa and dandelion yellow.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.314
But that's not what I mean
and you know it.

40:43.149 --> 40:44.150
I'm not...

40:44.859 --> 40:45.860
I'm not good at this.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.903
And I don't expect you to be.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.738
But I expect you to try.

40:50.489 --> 40:53.409
Look, two minutes
in the elevator, it's great.

40:53.742 --> 40:55.077
We're having fun,

40:55.536 --> 40:58.164
but we're not moving things forward.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.127
And I'm not sure you even want to.

41:04.545 --> 41:06.505
So, if you're not ready
to let me in...

41:07.506 --> 41:09.300
you should really let me go.

41:19.059 --> 41:20.436
When I was a kid...

41:21.353 --> 41:23.272
my dad would disappear

41:23.355 --> 41:24.648
for weeks at a time.

41:27.234 --> 41:28.944
And then, he would come home and

41:29.028 --> 41:30.362
try to put a smile on my face,

41:30.446 --> 41:33.032
pretend like everything was the same.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.578
He would tell me
what I wanted to hear,

41:37.661 --> 41:39.997
but all I really wanted was him.

41:40.498 --> 41:41.499
I learned...

41:42.333 --> 41:43.834
not to count on people.

41:44.919 --> 41:46.212
I still don't.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.464
Where is he now?

41:48.964 --> 41:50.216
I don't know.

41:52.218 --> 41:54.637
And I wish I didn't care.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.391
It still bugs me the way he left.

42:00.935 --> 42:02.436
And it bugs me that it bugs me.

42:03.687 --> 42:04.688
Hey.

42:05.147 --> 42:06.857
I'm not going anywhere.

42:09.777 --> 42:10.778
Okay?

42:12.196 --> 42:15.032
Well, then, you better
order me a real drink.

42:24.166 --> 42:25.167
Villa.

42:25.251 --> 42:28.546
Someone pulled a little
sleight-of-hand move on me tonight.

42:28.629 --> 42:30.005
Now, come on, now, why would I do that

42:30.089 --> 42:31.549
when I know how much
you hate magicians?

42:31.632 --> 42:33.425
Tonight was phase three, wasn't it?

42:34.051 --> 42:35.261
How's Adrian doing?

42:38.305 --> 42:40.474
-He's good.
-Adrian, my man!

42:40.558 --> 42:42.142
All right, Rosie,
calm down. He's fine.

42:42.226 --> 42:43.811
No, you said "good."

42:46.814 --> 42:48.691
Listen, I got to go.

42:48.774 --> 42:50.192
You two
have a nice time tonight, okay?

42:50.276 --> 42:51.277
Okay.

42:54.780 --> 42:56.365
Thanks for seeing me this late.

42:57.491 --> 42:58.534
Have a seat.

42:59.368 --> 43:00.411
I'll stand.

43:00.744 --> 43:03.247
I ran the additional test
you asked for.

43:03.581 --> 43:07.084
Your recent bender did more damage
to your body than we thought.

43:08.377 --> 43:09.545
Be specific.

43:11.839 --> 43:13.215
Do you have family?

43:13.299 --> 43:14.842
Yes, but they don't know I'm here.

43:16.135 --> 43:18.262
I think you're gonna need them.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.850
That's what I thought.
