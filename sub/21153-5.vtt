WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.572
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.605 --> 00:06.674
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.707 --> 00:09.477
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:09.510 --> 00:12.280
but at a terrible cost.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.183
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:15.216 --> 00:17.451
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:17.485 --> 00:20.088
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:21.355 --> 00:23.524
And then lab-made
creatures called hybrids

00:23.557 --> 00:25.759
devastated the West Coast.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.561
So a massive barrier
was constructed,

00:27.595 --> 00:30.131
to protect the rest
of North America,

00:30.164 --> 00:33.134
but new breeds have
started to appear,

00:33.167 --> 00:34.768
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.471
We battle on many fronts,

00:37.505 --> 00:39.773
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:39.807 --> 00:43.144
while racing to stop the
hybrids and a brutal terrorist

00:43.177 --> 00:45.579
who is using them to
end the human race.

00:45.613 --> 00:50.484
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.696
Previously on Zoo...
LEANNE: I'm here to make you a deal.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.488
I can get Isaac back.

00:54.522 --> 00:55.699
Let's talk about
Clementine Lewis.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.225
Deal is on. (grunting)

00:57.258 --> 00:58.826
LEANNE: Perfect.
By day's end, you'll be

00:58.859 --> 01:01.595
holding your son again.
MITCH: Who's The Falcon?

01:01.629 --> 01:03.340
JAMIE: I got really sick
of not seeing justice done,

01:03.364 --> 01:04.864
so I went out and did it myself.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.268
After all this time,
The Falcon's remained out of reach.

01:07.301 --> 01:09.137
LOGAN: Do you have any suspects?

01:09.170 --> 01:11.339
Yeah, we got one in custody.
I did it.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.774
My name is Jackson Oz.

01:13.807 --> 01:16.577
You said what we had was real,
but it was built on a lie.

01:16.610 --> 01:19.680
Tessa, please.
A pretty damn huge one.

01:21.215 --> 01:23.351
Mansdale. JAMIE: One of
the Shepherds who tried

01:23.384 --> 01:25.386
to end the world. (groaning)

01:26.754 --> 01:29.490
This is who we're looking for...
Abigail Westbrook.

01:29.523 --> 01:32.293
Abigail is setting off a
beacon inside Reiden Tower

01:32.326 --> 01:34.304
in New York City?
ABIGAIL: I'm going to create a new world.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.729
And I'm bringing
my hybrids with me.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.574
JACKSON: She used this
device back at the cabin.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.700
MITCH: That device was
attracting the hybrids

01:39.733 --> 01:41.669
to its location.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.338
(screeching)

01:48.176 --> 01:50.611
More questions than
answers at this hour

01:50.644 --> 01:53.647
after the first ever hybrid
attack on the East Coast.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.659
New York City has joined
the list of cities ravaged

01:55.683 --> 01:58.186
by a new species
of flying hybrids.

01:58.219 --> 02:00.521
Where did these winged
monsters come from?

02:00.554 --> 02:02.390
Were they linked
to hybrids spotted

02:02.423 --> 02:04.692
near the volcanic eruption
in Mexico yesterday?

02:04.725 --> 02:07.395
And perhaps, more importantly,

02:07.428 --> 02:08.895
where are they now?

02:08.929 --> 02:12.266
(screeching) DARIELA:
This is a bad idea.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.868
(groans) I found
the copper wire.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.937
No, that-that won't work.
It has to be insulated.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.840
Copper wire will
block the signal.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.709
Well, if you ask me,
blocking the signal's

02:21.742 --> 02:23.644
exactly what the doctor ordered.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.279
No.
If we do that, we have no way

02:25.313 --> 02:26.623
of knowing which way
the hybrids will fly.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.316
They could attack another city.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.551
(phone ringing) It's Mitch.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.720
Hey, we got a problem.

02:32.753 --> 02:34.622
Yeah, a big one.
You attached the beacon

02:34.655 --> 02:36.457
to a drone with a
bum fuel cylinder.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.559
We had to rescue it.
MITCH: So where are the hybrids?

02:38.592 --> 02:41.462
Oh, they're here,
trying to bash their way into the plane.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.397
We're going to
fly back to Mexico

02:43.431 --> 02:45.733
and drop this beacon
into the volcano.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.810
And the hybrids along with it.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
We have to make
sure to kill them.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.314
Cool plan...
provided you get to the volcano

02:50.338 --> 02:51.739
before the hybrids get to you.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.607
Yeah, thanks for the
vote of confidence.

02:53.641 --> 02:55.276
What's the update on Abigail?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.777
That's the other thing.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.746
Turns out, Logan's a lousy cop.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.881
He shot Abigail,
but she got away.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.816
Oh, and he arrested Jamie.

03:02.850 --> 03:03.884
What? Why?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.686
For murdering the Reiden CEO.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.688
Leanne Ducovny? She's dead?

03:07.721 --> 03:08.865
Banner day,
all things considered.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.324
I'm at the precinct now

03:10.358 --> 03:11.559
trying to sort it all out.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.826
Hey, is Clem with you guys?

03:12.860 --> 03:14.728
(loud banging)

03:14.762 --> 03:16.002
She's still in New York, Mitch.

03:16.029 --> 03:17.431
She went after a part

03:17.465 --> 03:19.667
for a truck,
and we had to take off.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.744
Sounds like she dodged a bullet.

03:20.768 --> 03:22.336
I'll track her down.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.438
Well, good luck with
the suicide mission.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.639
(loud banging)

03:25.673 --> 03:27.207
(grunts)

03:45.493 --> 03:46.773
JACKSON: We need
another battery.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.430
I'll grab it.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.810
DARIELA: We're almost there.
Is it ready?

04:02.843 --> 04:03.843
JACKSON: I hope so.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.026
30 miles out from the volcano.

04:19.059 --> 04:22.530
Okay, look, we only get one shot at this.
Wind's at 240 knots.

04:22.563 --> 04:24.641
Maybe we should wait until we're
close enough to the volcano,

04:24.665 --> 04:26.867
and then just drop it.
Ten miles out.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.044
We'd need to weigh it
down with something about

04:28.068 --> 04:29.603
a thousand pounds heavier.

04:35.343 --> 04:36.744
That'll work.

04:36.777 --> 04:39.680
Keep the press out.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.349
Don't confirm or
deny the suspect.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.384
The captain wants
this one kept quiet.

04:44.552 --> 04:46.420
Jamie.
Jamie, don't say anything.

04:46.454 --> 04:47.821
Okay? Let me call your lawyer.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.922
I need Mansdale.

04:52.726 --> 04:53.694
(loud banging)

04:53.727 --> 04:54.928
DARIELA: Hurry up.

05:04.905 --> 05:05.905
JACKSON: Open the door.

05:10.678 --> 05:12.846
(alarm blaring)

05:16.016 --> 05:17.618
Three, two,

05:17.651 --> 05:18.952
one.

05:21.789 --> 05:23.924
Mansda...
What do you need Mansdale for?

05:23.957 --> 05:25.926
Get him off the plane
and bring him here.

05:25.959 --> 05:28.396
No. No, no, no!

05:30.831 --> 05:32.332
No!

05:39.139 --> 05:41.341
♪

05:46.514 --> 05:48.115
What do you mean
Mansdale's gone?

05:48.148 --> 05:49.683
He escaped.

05:49.717 --> 05:51.652
Well,
how far could he have gone?

05:55.122 --> 05:57.558
Oh.

05:57.591 --> 05:58.826
That's not good.

05:58.859 --> 06:01.895
He hid in Jamie's Mustang.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.698
We put the beacon in the Mustang
and threw it into the volcano.

06:04.732 --> 06:05.899
Huh.

06:05.933 --> 06:07.601
Well, that's...

06:07.635 --> 06:08.702
unfortunate.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.770
But...

06:09.803 --> 06:11.171
I'll figure something out.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.806
How are you guys
used to these things?

06:12.840 --> 06:14.418
You can't be here.
Feel like I got a chickpea in my ear.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.082
Mitch, I'm serious.
You have to leave now.

06:16.109 --> 06:18.646
Nope. Not without Jamie.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.614
Come on. (Logan sighs)

06:20.648 --> 06:21.658
You know she didn't
kill anybody.

06:21.682 --> 06:22.883
She cares about one thing:

06:22.916 --> 06:23.751
hunting Shepherds.

06:23.784 --> 06:25.419
I never should've
let her into Reiden.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.420
Let me talk to her.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.955
She's a criminal. I'm a cop.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.122
You need to leave.

06:29.156 --> 06:32.560
Yeah.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.037
The way I hear it,
you've had it out for Jamie

06:34.061 --> 06:35.763
ever since she dumped you.

06:35.796 --> 06:38.666
You have no idea what
you're talking about, okay?

06:38.699 --> 06:39.933
You were gone for a long time.

06:39.967 --> 06:42.436
Well, I'm back now.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.847
And I'm not gonna
let you punish Jamie

06:43.871 --> 06:45.906
for breaking your little heart.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.083
So, you're gonna slap a
special consultant badge

06:47.107 --> 06:48.642
right here on my chest

06:48.676 --> 06:50.019
and you're gonna take
me in there with you,

06:50.043 --> 06:52.880
or your captain's
gonna hear about

06:52.913 --> 06:55.115
how you stormed
Reiden Tower and then

06:55.148 --> 06:58.786
disposed of key
evidence via mail drone.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.163
Right,
so you're gonna blackmail me

07:00.187 --> 07:02.022
for trying to stop Abigail?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.991
Yeah. Pretty much.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.860
JACKSON: It worked; all the
flying hybrids followed the beacon

07:06.894 --> 07:09.530
right into the volcano,
but we have to get to Abigail

07:09.563 --> 07:10.607
before she hurts anyone else.

07:10.631 --> 07:11.899
We should turn around

07:11.932 --> 07:12.866
and head back to New York.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.868
First we have to go after Isaac.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.237
Look, I'm sorry, rafiki,

07:17.270 --> 07:18.906
but we were not honest with you.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.609
Isaac is not safe.

07:21.642 --> 07:23.443
He's still in Reiden's custody.

07:24.645 --> 07:26.046
Why didn't you tell me?

07:26.079 --> 07:27.681
Dariela and I,

07:27.715 --> 07:30.884
we thought we could get
Isaac back on our own.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.686
But we were wrong.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.723
Then we'll go
after him together.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.057
Okay?

07:38.959 --> 07:43.931
I have not been honest
with you guys either.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.733
Back in Portland,

07:45.766 --> 07:48.736
Logan did some tests on Abigail's
blood, DNA tests.

07:48.769 --> 07:51.705
And... I should've just
told you from the beginning,

07:51.739 --> 07:54.942
but I thought that I could
handle it on my own, too.

07:54.975 --> 07:55.976
Handle what?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.845
Abigail...

07:59.279 --> 08:01.515
is my sister.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.017
Wh-What?

08:04.051 --> 08:06.720
Another one of my father's
secrets, I guess.

08:06.754 --> 08:07.955
I couldn't stop him.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.990
I have to stop her.

08:10.023 --> 08:11.692
(computer beeping)

08:11.725 --> 08:13.694
DARIELA: It's an SOS.

08:13.727 --> 08:15.262
Who could be signaling for help?

08:15.295 --> 08:18.866
Wasn't this side of the mountain
lost to hybrids years ago?

08:18.899 --> 08:19.909
The IADG evacuated everyone.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.969
We have to get down there.
I can't let anyone else

08:22.002 --> 08:23.203
die because of Abigail.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.905
Then we will go get Isaac.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.006
I promise.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.210
Okay.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.979
Let's do this.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.313
Abe?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.649
Isaac knows we're
coming for him.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.184
I hope so.

08:38.217 --> 08:41.722
I'm just thankful we didn't
trade Clem for Isaac.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.056
I mean,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.892
how could I look
into my son's eyes

08:44.925 --> 08:47.728
knowing that I put another
man's child in danger?

08:47.761 --> 08:49.930
You okay?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.999
Yeah.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.901
(sighs, mumbles)

09:04.344 --> 09:06.947
DARIELA: Abort. The deal is off.

09:06.980 --> 09:08.148
Do not touch Clementine.

09:08.181 --> 09:09.617
Let her go immediately.

09:09.650 --> 09:10.884
(phone beeps)

09:14.354 --> 09:17.057
We have a problem.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.226
See, we had a deal in place.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.828
With Reiden?

09:20.861 --> 09:23.797
Whatever they told
you, it isn't true.

09:23.831 --> 09:25.833
I didn't steal
anything from them.

09:27.735 --> 09:28.969
I want to believe you,

09:29.002 --> 09:31.171
Clementine, I do,

09:31.204 --> 09:34.642
but I have a vast experience
in matters such as these,

09:34.675 --> 09:36.944
and people don't make deals over

09:36.977 --> 09:39.146
valueless merchandise.

09:39.179 --> 09:41.615
See, Leanne? She's dead.

09:41.649 --> 09:45.719
And for the moment,
our deal is dead along with her.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.855
But, between you and me,

09:47.888 --> 09:50.090
I think that we can come
up with a better one.

09:50.123 --> 09:54.327
I just need to
know what makes you

09:54.361 --> 09:58.065
so special.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.332
Nothing.

10:09.176 --> 10:11.845
Please. Wait. No...

10:11.879 --> 10:14.047
Come on,
is it something you know?

10:14.081 --> 10:15.716
Something you have?

10:15.749 --> 10:16.850
Something you took?

10:16.884 --> 10:18.185
(breathing shakily)

10:21.922 --> 10:24.825
Please. Stop.

10:24.858 --> 10:26.259
You're making a mistake!

10:30.063 --> 10:31.231
Three,

10:31.264 --> 10:32.365
two,

10:32.399 --> 10:33.834
one.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.102
I'm pregnant!

10:39.139 --> 10:40.774
Shock me and you'll
kill the first baby

10:40.808 --> 10:44.244
conceived in the last ten years.

10:45.278 --> 10:47.681
Let's call The Gentlemen.

10:47.715 --> 10:50.117
Who... who are The Gentlemen?

10:52.352 --> 10:54.154
Who are The Gentlemen?

10:54.187 --> 10:57.925
Who are The Gentlemen?!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.476
(door closes)

11:16.509 --> 11:18.145
Is my friend coming?

11:18.178 --> 11:20.981
Uh, long story, but no.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.150
He's definitely
not gonna make it.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
It's gonna take
more than friends

11:25.218 --> 11:27.220
to get you out of this
one, Jamie.

11:27.254 --> 11:29.122
We have your prints
on the door handle,

11:29.156 --> 11:32.159
on Leanne's tablet,
and on Leanne's body.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.994
And your confession
at the scene.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.267
I want to speak to my attorney.

11:35.295 --> 11:36.363
Have you called them?

11:36.396 --> 11:37.865
I'm representing myself.

11:37.898 --> 11:39.833
You're joking, right? No,

11:39.867 --> 11:41.902
and I'm appointing a
co-counsel, Mitch Morgan.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.904
Um, no.

11:43.937 --> 11:45.472
Uh, that's a terrible idea.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.140
And an illegal one.

11:47.174 --> 11:48.484
Actually,
if you pull my medical records,

11:48.508 --> 11:50.186
you'll see that I've
been diagnosed with PTSD.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.013
Because of that disability,
I'm allowed to appoint

11:53.046 --> 11:54.882
co-counsel when choosing
to self-represent.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.251
Mitch, please.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.536
You happen to have one
that says "co-counsel"?

12:07.560 --> 12:08.962
Don't do this.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.097
You're not a lawyer.

12:10.130 --> 12:12.099
Well, you're not a cop.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.935
So, I'd like to be
alone with my client.

12:21.441 --> 12:23.877
Go for it.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.785
Just tell me the truth.

12:31.819 --> 12:34.421
You didn't really kill this
woman, right?

12:43.030 --> 12:46.366
ABRAHAM: This is where
the SOS signal originated.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.342
Hello? Anyone here?

12:55.375 --> 12:58.378
That's good,
call the razorbacks to our position.

13:00.914 --> 13:03.583
Hello?

13:03.616 --> 13:05.919
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:08.155 --> 13:09.389
Ugh.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.391
Jackson. Tessa.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.593
What are you doing here?

13:13.626 --> 13:16.897
We heard your distress call.

13:16.930 --> 13:19.266
These are my friends,
Abraham and Dariela Kenyatta.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.234
Guys, this is Tessa.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.336
Pleasure to meet you.
We've heard a lot about you.

13:24.571 --> 13:26.415
I assumed that you were
staying behind in Portland.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.108
They closed the camp.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.277
We got word people
needed an evac here.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.246
I was doing a final
sweep till my truck died.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.248
That's your radiator hose.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.250
We can plug it up and refill it.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.153
We heard this place had been
overrun by hybrids years ago.

13:40.187 --> 13:42.255
The area, yes; the town, no.

13:42.289 --> 13:44.524
The villagers say they haven't
seen a hybrid in years.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.293
No razorbacks?

13:46.326 --> 13:48.295
No razorbacks, no angry rhinos.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.297
Nothing.

13:50.330 --> 13:51.899
They claim there's
a witch in town

13:51.932 --> 13:53.133
who's kept the hybrids away.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.170
JACKSON: Okay, this witch.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.939
Did she evacuate
with the others?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.440
No, she's refusing to leave.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.275
Well, then I think I'd
like to talk to her.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.877
I'd like to talk
her into leaving.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.478
And loop back with my team.

14:05.512 --> 14:06.914
I don't think
that's a good idea.

14:06.947 --> 14:08.348
The volcano's unstable,

14:08.381 --> 14:10.283
it won't be long before
this area is toast.

14:10.317 --> 14:13.053
Look, if this woman really
can keep the hybrids away,

14:13.086 --> 14:16.056
then maybe there's a way she
can help us stop Abigail.

14:16.089 --> 14:18.158
It's worth a chance.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.468
Circle the plane,
keep it out of the ash,

14:19.492 --> 14:21.228
I'll radio in ten minutes.

14:22.262 --> 14:23.430
(exhales)

14:23.463 --> 14:24.564
Let's go find your witch.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.273
I know that Leanne
was The Falcon,

14:33.306 --> 14:35.108
the Shepherd you've
been hunting.

14:35.142 --> 14:38.511
But what, you... you killed her?

14:38.545 --> 14:42.382
Here's the thing,
she's been trying to kill me for years.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.918
But until today,
you didn't even know who she was.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.519
Mansdale has access to the files

14:46.553 --> 14:48.521
that prove she was after me.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.523
You have to get him here.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.994
Mansdale. He escaped...

14:55.462 --> 14:57.264
hid in your Mustang,
and the brain trust

14:57.297 --> 14:58.498
put the beacon in the Mustang,

14:58.531 --> 15:00.500
and the Mustang
into the volcano.

15:00.533 --> 15:03.971
Of course they did.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.639
Okay, so we just have to
get the files ourselves.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.308
We can get them
from Reiden Global

15:08.341 --> 15:10.143
as evidence in
the investigation.

15:10.177 --> 15:12.479
Jamie, this is stupid.

15:12.512 --> 15:15.048
Come on, you need
a, a real lawyer.

15:15.082 --> 15:18.051
No, I need someone I can trust.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.053
Someone who knows me.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.189
(sighs)

15:31.531 --> 15:33.666
Hey, Clem, it's your dad.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.337
Jackson tells me you're
still in New York.

15:37.370 --> 15:39.406
So am I.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.042
And apparently I'm a lawyer now.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.477
Long story. Anyway, um...

15:44.511 --> 15:48.548
I know you're an adult
and everything, but...

15:48.581 --> 15:51.151
if I don't hear from you soon,
I'm gonna start picturing you

15:51.184 --> 15:52.495
tied up in the back
of a van someplace,

15:52.519 --> 15:54.487
so give me a call, please.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.589
Okay?

16:03.196 --> 16:04.597
You look well.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.000
Small talk, really?

16:07.034 --> 16:09.402
That's your plan?

16:09.436 --> 16:11.304
Well,
the last time I apologized,

16:11.338 --> 16:13.273
I got slapped in the face,

16:13.306 --> 16:15.742
so I wasn't sure how a
second apology would go over.

16:15.775 --> 16:17.610
Not well.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.481
You explained
yourself in Portland.

16:21.514 --> 16:24.551
And to be honest, I get it.

16:24.584 --> 16:28.321
I get why you lied and
hid from the truth.

16:28.355 --> 16:30.657
In a way, I was hiding, too.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.993
From what?

16:38.465 --> 16:42.369
Ever since I was a little girl,

16:42.402 --> 16:46.139
all I dreamed about
was being a mother.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.808
I wanted a whole
litter of babies.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.811
I wanted to love them.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.347
And hold them.

16:54.381 --> 16:55.782
Help them grow up.

16:55.815 --> 16:58.785
I know it sounds simple
and old-fashioned,

16:58.818 --> 17:02.355
but it's what I was meant to be.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.624
But when your father
dropped the TX-gas,

17:04.656 --> 17:07.460
I knew my dream was over.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.662
So I tried to forget it.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.699
I moved to Portland,
I tried to help people in other ways,

17:12.732 --> 17:15.635
but it wasn't enough.

17:17.670 --> 17:22.142
Thinking about that family
that I dreamed about,

17:22.175 --> 17:24.777
that... I'll never get to have,

17:24.810 --> 17:28.615
it hurts every day.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.288
I had a family once.

17:37.457 --> 17:40.093
A wife and a son.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.728
I was 19.

17:41.761 --> 17:44.597
We were day-tripping to Nairobi,

17:44.631 --> 17:47.434
and we had been driving all day,

17:47.467 --> 17:51.771
and I was thirsty,
so we stopped at a gas station.

17:55.708 --> 17:59.346
And I remember taking too long
inside, you know,

17:59.379 --> 18:03.716
I was trying to decide
between coffee and tea.

18:06.719 --> 18:09.689
And then I heard it.

18:09.722 --> 18:12.559
It's like a bomb went off.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.661
(exhales)

18:14.694 --> 18:18.865
A truck lost control,
slammed into one of the pumps.

18:20.900 --> 18:23.603
His name was Connor.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.573
He was six months old.

18:26.606 --> 18:30.210
Oh, Jackson, I...
you didn't tell me.

18:30.243 --> 18:32.679
No one outside my family
knew, Tessa.

18:32.712 --> 18:36.816
Abe's the only one
alive who knows.

18:36.849 --> 18:39.719
Tried to forget,
I tried to move on with my life,

18:39.752 --> 18:40.720
but you're right,

18:40.753 --> 18:43.756
it hurts every single day.

18:44.757 --> 18:48.395
Now, Tessa,

18:48.428 --> 18:52.399
I know that if we
can stop Abigail,

18:52.432 --> 18:56.603
I know that we can find a way

18:56.636 --> 18:59.272
to reverse the TX-gas.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.511
I've come to terms that I can
never bring my family back.

19:06.513 --> 19:10.417
But I'm not gonna
give up on yours.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.687
I promise you that.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.491
Sure Jackson and
Tessa will be okay?

19:18.525 --> 19:22.929
Well, I think they
needed some time alone.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.964
And perhaps this witch
really does know something

19:24.997 --> 19:28.768
about the hybrids or Abigail.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.938
(phone ringing)

19:31.971 --> 19:34.541
ISAAC: Mom, is that you?

19:34.574 --> 19:36.943
Isaac, baby? We're here.

19:36.976 --> 19:39.346
What? Oh, my God.

19:39.379 --> 19:41.224
Isaac. Isaac, are you okay? Mr. and Mrs.
Kenyatta, Reiden thanks you

19:41.248 --> 19:42.658
for your patience
during this trying time.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.985
Isaac and the other
children have been integral

19:46.018 --> 19:47.720
to our efforts to
solve the TX-sterility.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.789
Isaac, we're coming to get you
soon, okay?

19:49.822 --> 19:51.524
Now, I'd like to assure you

19:51.558 --> 19:53.693
that despite recent
changes to our management,

19:53.726 --> 19:54.870
all children under
Reiden's charge

19:54.894 --> 19:56.829
remain safe and well cared for.

19:56.863 --> 20:00.400
And we're happy to report that
all children, including Isaac,

20:00.433 --> 20:02.635
will be returned safely to
their families next week.

20:02.669 --> 20:04.671
We want to talk to our son.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.539
Of course.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.613
Tell your parents how much
fun you're having, Isaac.

20:08.641 --> 20:10.743
We get to play

20:10.777 --> 20:15.348
and hear the radio
and do flash cards.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.984
Oh, and we get
candy for breakfast.

20:18.017 --> 20:20.620
TAD: Like I said, they'll be home soon.
Candy for breakfast?

20:20.653 --> 20:21.730
And I'm afraid that's
all the time we have,

20:21.754 --> 20:23.256
but you'll have plenty of time

20:23.290 --> 20:24.433
to catch up next week. No. No.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.759
Wait, wait, a... No, wait, wait!

20:26.793 --> 20:29.729
Why?

20:29.762 --> 20:31.731
Why let us see him at all

20:31.764 --> 20:33.733
if they're just
gonna yank him away?

20:33.766 --> 20:35.702
No.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.670
Reiden knows they can
hold onto the children

20:37.704 --> 20:39.472
for only so long.

20:39.506 --> 20:43.276
Do you think we'll get
him back next week?

20:44.311 --> 20:46.279
Honestly, no.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.342
This must be the place.

21:21.848 --> 21:24.717
There's got to be a scientific
explanation for this, right?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.719
The trees may be
creating a windbreak,

21:26.753 --> 21:28.355
keeping the ash away.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.791
Or, flip side,
this woman really is a witch.

21:36.529 --> 21:38.931
Isn't that...?

21:40.367 --> 21:42.569
Abigail's symbol?

21:42.602 --> 21:44.537
It matches.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.357
She's asking if
you're Mr. Duncan.

22:04.391 --> 22:05.925
Do you know who that is?

22:09.028 --> 22:12.131
No. But there's only
one way to find out.

22:12.164 --> 22:13.666
Sí...

22:13.700 --> 22:14.901
Señor Duncan.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.404
Que buena.

22:22.975 --> 22:25.077
You're wasting your time.

22:25.111 --> 22:28.147
She confessed. It's case closed.

22:28.180 --> 22:30.450
She told me it was self-defense.

22:30.483 --> 22:31.684
And you believe her?

22:31.718 --> 22:34.020
I know Jamie.
I know when she's lying.

22:34.053 --> 22:35.788
No, you knew Jamie.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.990
Ten years ago. She's changed.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.026
And the things that
I've seen her do...

22:40.059 --> 22:43.162
You remember a Shepherd
named Mansdale, right?

22:43.195 --> 22:46.566
She murdered him two years ago.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.568
All in pursuit of
this Shepherd crusade

22:48.601 --> 22:51.037
she's been on. Nope.

22:51.070 --> 22:55.174
Mansdale's been chained up
in the bottom of the plane.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.710
She's been hanging on
to him for information.

22:57.744 --> 22:58.945
Now,

22:58.978 --> 23:01.948
although that's not
pretty, it's not murder.

23:01.981 --> 23:03.692
You're telling me Mansdale's
on the plane right now?

23:03.716 --> 23:06.152
I'm telling you she
didn't kill him.

23:06.185 --> 23:08.130
Now, if you knew her as
well as you thought you did,

23:08.154 --> 23:10.056
or if you were a better cop,

23:10.089 --> 23:12.091
you'd have figured
that out for yourself.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.635
(beeping) What are you doing?

23:22.669 --> 23:24.937
One of us is right and
one of us is wrong.

23:24.971 --> 23:28.641
Figure it out faster
if we work together.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.009
I don't need your help.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.011
I'm a scientist, for God's sake.

23:32.044 --> 23:33.546
You're a vet.

23:57.704 --> 24:00.640
(breathing heavily)

24:12.652 --> 24:14.487
So, you and Jamie...

24:14.521 --> 24:16.989
you're just going to pick
up where you left off, huh?

24:17.023 --> 24:19.058
Like nothing happened?

24:20.660 --> 24:22.695
I was in a tank for ten years.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.531
Nothing did happen.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.098
I happened.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.536
Come on, you two played
house for a couple of years

24:29.569 --> 24:30.970
until Jamie got bored.

24:31.003 --> 24:33.139
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

24:33.172 --> 24:35.842
None at all.

24:35.875 --> 24:37.677
What is this?

24:45.985 --> 24:48.688
I don't know,
it looks like it's encrypted.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.699
Yeah, but that's illegal
in a murder investigation.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.692
So, how do we unencrypt it?

24:52.725 --> 24:55.027
Looks like SDE.

24:55.061 --> 24:58.531
That's Single Device Encryption.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.900
Can only be viewed by
one specific device,

25:00.933 --> 25:02.802
probably Leanne's tablet.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.905
Well, we have her
tablet here in evidence.

25:05.938 --> 25:07.239
Yeah, but it's bio-protected.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.676
It won't unlock without
her fingerprint.

25:13.212 --> 25:16.816
Correct me if I'm wrong, but...

25:16.849 --> 25:19.986
don't we have Leanne's
finger, and its print,

25:20.019 --> 25:22.021
on the premises?

25:24.924 --> 25:27.126
That's not the way things work.

25:27.159 --> 25:30.597
I need a court order for this.

25:30.630 --> 25:34.066
Well, how bad do you want the
truth, Detective?

25:34.100 --> 25:35.635
Abe, where are you going?

25:35.668 --> 25:37.069
Clementine's room.

25:37.103 --> 25:38.204
Abe?

25:38.237 --> 25:42.041
Look, Leanne said Clementine
stole something from Reiden.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.743
That's why they wanted her.

25:43.776 --> 25:46.112
If we can find it,
then maybe Reiden will talk to us again.

25:46.145 --> 25:47.914
We can't trust Reiden,
there's no guarantee

25:47.947 --> 25:49.124
that they'll give us Isaac back.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.282
No, but maybe it will help

25:50.316 --> 25:52.151
tip the scales to our advantage.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.987
We have to find what
Clementine stole from them.

26:04.363 --> 26:07.233
She's taking us to see
someone named Abendegos

26:07.266 --> 26:09.035
who's been waiting
for Mr. Duncan.

26:09.068 --> 26:11.237
Wild guess you don't know who that
is, either.

26:11.270 --> 26:13.005
No.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.207
We just assumed that
Abigail was working alone,

26:15.241 --> 26:16.876
but it makes sense
that she wasn't.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.145
Yeah, well,
let's just hope that this Abendegos

26:19.178 --> 26:20.880
and Mr. Duncan have never met,

26:20.913 --> 26:23.182
or we might be one
step closer to dead.

26:29.288 --> 26:30.222
Hey, hey!

26:30.256 --> 26:31.357
(speaking Spanish)

26:40.266 --> 26:41.300
¿Señor Duncan?

26:50.810 --> 26:53.212
We need to leave the
guns on the table.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.161
(door creaking)

27:09.195 --> 27:11.263
(snoring)

27:16.168 --> 27:17.704
(screeching)

27:17.737 --> 27:19.005
(chains rattling)

27:19.038 --> 27:21.340
(screeching)

27:21.373 --> 27:23.109
(yelping)

27:24.176 --> 27:26.312
(growling): Jackson... Jackson.

27:35.121 --> 27:36.441
(howling and
growling in distance)

27:39.191 --> 27:41.694
(breathing heavily)

27:41.728 --> 27:43.395
(groans)

27:50.870 --> 27:54.707
(howling and
growling in distance)

27:58.244 --> 28:00.212
(growls) Sorry,
did that thing just say your name?

28:00.246 --> 28:02.448
No, no, that's impossible.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.350
(growling): Jackson.

28:05.517 --> 28:08.087
Okay. Maybe not impossible.

28:08.120 --> 28:12.258
So, Abendegos is a
hybrid who can talk.

28:12.291 --> 28:14.036
Remind me never to go
anywhere with you again.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.427
We need to tighten
its restraints.

28:15.461 --> 28:16.495
You have a necklace

28:16.528 --> 28:18.130
or a bracelet or something?

28:18.164 --> 28:19.507
What? No, why?
Because it looks part baboon.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.835
Baboons are driven by curiosity.

28:22.869 --> 28:23.870
I need something shiny.

28:23.903 --> 28:25.471
Okay. Hey!

28:25.504 --> 28:26.973
(growling)

28:27.006 --> 28:28.274
No, your clicker, you need that

28:28.307 --> 28:29.508
to control your lions.

28:29.541 --> 28:31.043
Jack!

28:33.379 --> 28:36.115
I guess we can kiss any
animal assistance good-bye.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.017
(screeching)

28:38.050 --> 28:39.018
You couldn't have

28:39.051 --> 28:40.319
thrown a stick or something?

28:40.352 --> 28:41.520
I was improvising.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.355
(screeching)

28:54.300 --> 28:56.068
We don't even know
what we're looking for.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.370
Well, whatever it is,
Reiden wants it very badly.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.506
Hopefully,
we'll know it when we see it.

29:03.976 --> 29:06.112
What are those?

29:06.145 --> 29:08.280
Perhaps Clementine
was sick again

29:08.314 --> 29:09.782
with her Glazier's disease.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.952
Iron, vitamin D...

29:12.985 --> 29:15.321
folic acid.

29:17.489 --> 29:19.425
No, it can't be. What?

29:19.458 --> 29:22.394
Do you remember when
we went to Africa?

29:22.428 --> 29:24.096
After the TX-gas dropped?

29:24.130 --> 29:26.032
I-I couldn't find
prenatal vitamins.

29:26.065 --> 29:28.434
So, you got 12 bottles and
made your own cocktail.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.302
I bought these
exact supplements.

29:30.336 --> 29:33.005
What are you trying to say?

29:33.039 --> 29:34.173
This is impossible.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.008
She can't be pregnant.

29:36.042 --> 29:37.576
DARIELA: There's
blood on her shirt,

29:37.609 --> 29:39.178
from when she was shot.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.480
How quickly can you test this?

29:42.514 --> 29:45.284
(beeping)

29:47.186 --> 29:48.454
(beeping stops)

30:04.203 --> 30:05.171
How long is his break?

30:05.204 --> 30:06.272
20 minutes.

30:08.240 --> 30:12.278
(sniffs) Formaldehyde.
Smells like home.

30:12.311 --> 30:13.880
That's disgusting.

30:13.913 --> 30:16.182
What's disgusting is
you arresting Jamie

30:16.215 --> 30:18.193
because your badge and gun
didn't woo her back to you.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.986
Oh, my God, enough.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.988
You want to know the truth?

30:22.021 --> 30:24.356
Everything with Clem
and the hybrids,

30:24.390 --> 30:25.491
Jamie just changed.

30:25.524 --> 30:27.359
She got angry at the world.

30:27.393 --> 30:29.862
I tried to help her,
like she helped me,

30:29.896 --> 30:30.863
but I couldn't,

30:30.897 --> 30:32.932
so I left.

30:32.965 --> 30:34.205
You're telling me you left her,

30:34.233 --> 30:35.310
not the other way around? Yeah.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.344
I thought it'd be
a wake-up call,

30:36.368 --> 30:38.337
but it just...

30:38.370 --> 30:41.040
sped up her descent.

30:41.073 --> 30:43.209
Now every Shepherd
whose life she destroys,

30:43.242 --> 30:44.376
I feel responsible.

30:46.045 --> 30:47.313
All right, here's Leanne.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.525
Nothing's happening.

30:59.558 --> 31:02.528
It's too cold. It's not reading.

31:02.561 --> 31:05.031
Now warm it up.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.015
(beeps) Works every time.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.961
I don't know,
there's something wrong.

31:34.994 --> 31:38.064
This should be the device
that decrypts the file.

31:38.097 --> 31:39.098
Nancy Drew.

31:43.169 --> 31:45.271
That a normal thing these days?

31:45.304 --> 31:47.273
No.

31:50.176 --> 31:51.410
Wait, Mitch, Mitch.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.450
Could be the device
we're looking for.

32:05.457 --> 32:09.395
Yeah, looks like some
kind of bioprocessor.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.969
Okay.

32:17.003 --> 32:18.237
So, did you want to...

32:18.270 --> 32:20.072
Oh, hey,
I just had her finger in my mouth.

32:20.106 --> 32:22.008
This one's all you, pal.

32:22.041 --> 32:24.977
Great.

32:25.011 --> 32:27.113
Thank you.

32:39.058 --> 32:40.326
I can read it.

32:40.359 --> 32:42.128
But...

32:42.161 --> 32:43.195
What?

32:43.229 --> 32:44.663
But it's not about Jamie.

32:44.696 --> 32:46.498
It's a record of Reiden

32:46.532 --> 32:49.568
buying out some
pharmaceutical company.

32:49.601 --> 32:51.737
The Melvatox Corporation.

32:51.770 --> 32:53.572
Apparently, Reiden acquired

32:53.605 --> 32:56.508
100% of their product stock.

33:11.790 --> 33:15.061
I can't believe it.

33:15.094 --> 33:17.529
How did this happen?

33:17.563 --> 33:20.532
Clem wasn't a criminal.

33:20.566 --> 33:21.600
She was pregnant

33:21.633 --> 33:24.770
and somehow Reiden knew.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.572
They were using us.

33:26.605 --> 33:30.509
We need to find
Clementine immediately.

33:30.542 --> 33:32.311
She must be protected.

33:32.344 --> 33:34.080
It's too late.

33:36.415 --> 33:39.518
Dariela?

33:39.551 --> 33:41.553
What have you done?

33:49.161 --> 33:50.129
(loud banging)

33:50.162 --> 33:52.664
(Abendegos growling)

33:57.169 --> 33:58.613
JACKSON: We need to
study this creature.

33:58.637 --> 34:00.148
TESSA: No way we're
getting it outside.

34:00.172 --> 34:01.473
No, I know.

34:01.507 --> 34:03.251
We're gonna tow this whole
thing back to the plane.

34:03.275 --> 34:04.776
What about the gruesome twosome?

34:04.810 --> 34:06.854
Something tells me they're
not gonna be okay with that.

34:06.878 --> 34:09.248
We won't ask them.

34:10.282 --> 34:11.449
(Abendegos roars)

34:11.483 --> 34:12.627
I don't know where
they took her.

34:12.650 --> 34:14.085
I've been trying to find them

34:14.120 --> 34:15.362
ever since we
heard about Leanne.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.487
Get out of my lab.

34:16.522 --> 34:17.489
I can fix this. Get out.

34:17.523 --> 34:18.489
I can find her, Abe.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.226
Get out!

34:30.235 --> 34:32.237
(Abendegos roaring)

34:45.650 --> 34:46.851
(Abendegos howls, screeches)

34:50.856 --> 34:52.257
(gunshots)

34:56.661 --> 35:00.466
I think they figured out
you're not Mr. Duncan.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.540
This Melvatox Corporation
was started three years ago

35:08.574 --> 35:10.509
as a pharmaceutical company.

35:10.542 --> 35:11.677
They only had one product,

35:11.710 --> 35:13.745
a migraine drug
called Melvatox-B,

35:13.779 --> 35:15.481
before going bankrupt.

35:15.514 --> 35:18.450
Apparently the drug had
severe cognitive side effects.

35:18.484 --> 35:20.762
Leanne was able to purchase
them for pennies on the dollar.

35:20.786 --> 35:24.156
I'm guessing she wiped
the rest of the records.

35:24.190 --> 35:26.158
That's all that we could find.

35:26.192 --> 35:27.402
JAMIE: So,
it was the contact lens

35:27.426 --> 35:28.636
that decrypted it,
not the tablet.

35:28.660 --> 35:30.496
Yes,
which is all very fascinating

35:30.529 --> 35:32.664
to someone, I'm sure,

35:32.698 --> 35:34.766
but none of it proves you
acted in self-defense.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.760
It's because I didn't kill
Leanne in self-defense.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.708
I didn't kill her at all.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.644
She was dead when I found her.

35:45.677 --> 35:47.546
Then why the hell
did you confess?

35:47.579 --> 35:49.215
For this file.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.792
I'd found out that The Falcon
was protecting the file

35:50.816 --> 35:52.656
and she had the only
device that could read it.

35:52.684 --> 35:54.353
Freeze. Drop your weapon.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.421
JAMIE: With Leanne dead,

35:55.454 --> 35:57.556
I knew that the only way
to get access to that file

35:57.589 --> 35:58.957
was to confess to her murder.

35:58.990 --> 35:59.958
If it was requested

35:59.991 --> 36:01.393
with the discovery powers

36:01.427 --> 36:02.670
granted in a murder
investigation,

36:02.694 --> 36:04.596
Reiden would be legally
forced to release it.

36:04.630 --> 36:05.697
I did it.

36:05.731 --> 36:06.865
I killed her.

36:06.898 --> 36:07.933
I needed a cop

36:07.966 --> 36:09.568
to arrest me

36:09.601 --> 36:11.570
and a lawyer to
request the file.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.439
I knew you both
would be so desperate

36:13.472 --> 36:15.417
to prove you were right that
you'd do whatever it took

36:15.441 --> 36:16.542
to find the device.

36:16.575 --> 36:18.677
So, you were lying...

36:18.710 --> 36:19.645
the entire time.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.513
To both of us.

36:21.547 --> 36:23.258
If I had told you I was
innocent, you both would be

36:23.282 --> 36:24.559
so busy looking
for the real killer

36:24.583 --> 36:25.627
that we'd have
missed our chance.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.720
(phone ringing and vibrating)

36:28.754 --> 36:31.523
MITCH: Dariela.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.625
This is not over.

36:37.696 --> 36:39.331
(door closes)

36:39.365 --> 36:41.833
So you didn't kill
Mansdale or Leanne?

36:41.867 --> 36:44.703
I've never killed a Shepherd.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.506
They take lives, futures.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.441
I can't cross that line.

36:49.475 --> 36:53.379
So, if Reiden and the Shepherds
were after this Melvatox-B,

36:53.412 --> 36:54.680
what is it?

36:54.713 --> 36:56.682
I don't know.

36:56.715 --> 37:00.452
But they will kill
to keep it secret.

37:00.486 --> 37:03.922
We need to find out what
they're doing with it

37:03.955 --> 37:05.624
and stop them.

37:17.736 --> 37:19.738
Good morning.

37:19.771 --> 37:20.872
Here's your candy.

37:20.906 --> 37:21.907
Enjoy it.

37:21.940 --> 37:22.908
Good morning, Isaac.

37:22.941 --> 37:24.310
Good morning.

37:24.343 --> 37:26.044
How are you? Good.

37:26.077 --> 37:27.613
Great.

37:27.646 --> 37:29.948
There you are.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.550
Good morning.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.952
Enjoy the candy.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.388
Dariela? What's wrong?
What's going on?

37:36.422 --> 37:38.690
It's Clem.
We don't have much time.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.801
You're the only one
who can save her.

37:39.825 --> 37:41.760
Save her?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.595
What-what are you talking about?

37:43.629 --> 37:45.740
I'm sorry. I don't,
I don't know how to tell you this,

37:45.764 --> 37:48.300
but we ran some
tests on Clem's blood

37:48.334 --> 37:49.801
and she's pregnant.

37:49.835 --> 37:51.703
And somehow Reiden
found out about it

37:51.737 --> 37:54.940
and-and she's been
abducted, kidnapped.

37:57.108 --> 38:01.480
But I found her and you
have to go to her now.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.422
Listen, I can explain, okay?

38:10.456 --> 38:13.291
Abigail is my sister.

38:15.361 --> 38:16.504
I think I can talk them down.

38:16.528 --> 38:18.029
Tessa, just don't...

38:40.419 --> 38:41.687
No!

38:41.720 --> 38:43.054
(mountain lion roars)

38:58.937 --> 39:01.673
(snarling)

39:05.143 --> 39:07.345
(mountain lions growling)

39:29.535 --> 39:31.036
What's happening?

39:31.069 --> 39:33.539
Is this because that thing
smashed your clicker?

39:33.572 --> 39:36.141
I don't think so.

39:36.174 --> 39:39.377
Home.

39:58.163 --> 40:02.734
I traced where the
mercs took Clem...

40:02.768 --> 40:04.770
and I told Mitch.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.940
Let's pray he gets
to her in time.

40:08.974 --> 40:10.776
Abe.

40:10.809 --> 40:14.179
I know what I did was wrong...

40:14.212 --> 40:17.015
but I did it for Isaac.

40:17.048 --> 40:21.186
You can't stand
there, pretending...

40:21.219 --> 40:24.856
you didn't consider
turning Clem in yourself.

40:24.890 --> 40:27.726
I spared you the guilt
of that decision.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.896
And I can live with that...

40:30.929 --> 40:35.567
but I can't be in a marriage
where my husband despises me.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.905
When this is over...

40:41.907 --> 40:43.475
and Isaac is safe...

40:44.743 --> 40:46.712
I think...

40:46.745 --> 40:49.848
we should get a divorce.

40:59.991 --> 41:04.630
(crying): That...
that was your chance to disagree.

41:14.540 --> 41:17.643
I separated some
of the child's DNA

41:17.676 --> 41:20.546
from Clementine's blood sample.

41:22.981 --> 41:25.851
This child...

41:25.884 --> 41:28.887
is not just a miracle.

41:28.920 --> 41:31.022
It is our salvation.

41:31.056 --> 41:34.826
It shares the same hormone
as the new hybrids.

41:34.860 --> 41:38.063
It is the missing piece

41:38.096 --> 41:40.999
to solving the TX-sterility.

41:50.576 --> 41:52.544
Clementine and her
child must survive

41:52.578 --> 41:55.080
because if they die,

41:55.113 --> 41:59.585
all of mankind dies with them.

42:01.186 --> 42:03.555
MAN (over speaker): Wake her up.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.927
WOMAN: Okay, sweetie.

42:08.960 --> 42:11.930
You're okay.

42:11.963 --> 42:13.699
There's someone you should see.

42:22.674 --> 42:24.676
Oh, my God, is that...

42:27.746 --> 42:31.349
It's a boy.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.951
He's beautiful.

42:37.689 --> 42:41.693
Tell The Gentlemen that bidding
will begin at $80 million.
