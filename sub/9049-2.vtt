00:02.472 --> 00:07.576
Lily, I am so excited you decided
to take music lessons with me.

00:07.578 --> 00:09.177
Well, what are you
interested in learning?

00:09.179 --> 00:11.279
Guitar? Violin? Accordion?

00:11.281 --> 00:12.748
Nothing really.

00:14.951 --> 00:17.486
But your mom just signed you
up for music lessons with me.

00:17.488 --> 00:22.791
I know! I get to be with Ally Dawson
for a whole hour every Wednesday!

00:22.793 --> 00:24.059
Can I have an autograph?

00:24.090 --> 00:27.963
Listen, Lily. I am flattered you
wanted to meet me so badly.

00:27.965 --> 00:30.699
But there are kids on the
waiting list for lessons

00:30.701 --> 00:32.901
that are actually
interested in music.

00:32.903 --> 00:35.470
I like listening to music...

00:35.472 --> 00:37.272
I do, too.

00:37.274 --> 00:39.408
But playing music
is even better.

00:39.410 --> 00:43.345
When you're playing music you feel
like you're flying on a unicorn...

00:43.347 --> 00:45.480
Through a rainbow...

00:45.482 --> 00:49.251
And landing on a cloud
made of cotton candy!

00:49.253 --> 00:51.920
Are you sure you write
your own lyrics?

00:51.922 --> 00:56.825
The point is playing music
can be very rewarding.

00:56.827 --> 00:58.827
So...

00:58.829 --> 01:01.263
You're not going to sign my CD?

01:02.231 --> 01:03.999
Of course I'll sign it.

01:04.001 --> 01:07.067
Now, if you don't mind,
there are a whole bunch

01:07.098 --> 01:10.005
of kids out there waiting
for a group lesson.

01:10.007 --> 01:11.940
I understand.

01:11.942 --> 01:13.241
Selfie!

01:16.816 --> 01:20.015
All right! Who's ready
for a music lesson?

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:18.641 --> 02:20.575
Good job. I'll see
you next week.

02:21.911 --> 02:26.081
I have been helping this
customer for over three hours.

02:26.083 --> 02:27.983
I think he's finally
gonna buy something.

02:29.852 --> 02:31.019
So, uh, what do you think?

02:31.021 --> 02:33.455
This banjo is twanging my name.

02:33.457 --> 02:35.056
I'm gonna buy it.

02:35.058 --> 02:37.092
From this discount
banjo seller online.

02:37.094 --> 02:39.694
- Wait, what?
- And purchased.

02:39.696 --> 02:41.596
Thanks for all your
help, brother.

02:43.766 --> 02:44.487
Man!

02:44.518 --> 02:47.369
Customers keep coming in here
to try out the instruments,

02:47.371 --> 02:49.404
and then buying them
for less online.

02:49.406 --> 02:52.107
I know. Can you believe
how cheap people are?

02:52.109 --> 02:55.777
Says the man who takes rolls of
toilet paper from the mall restroom.

02:57.046 --> 03:00.615
Well, at least the store's staying busy
with kids signing up for music lessons.

03:00.617 --> 03:02.984
I mean, look at that line
of them outside right now!

03:02.986 --> 03:05.487
Ally merch! Get your
Ally merch here!

03:05.489 --> 03:08.890
I got Ally shirts,
Ally hats, Ally nuts.

03:11.360 --> 03:13.395
Guess who's selling Ally stuff.

03:13.397 --> 03:15.397
Seriously?

03:15.399 --> 03:17.799
Aw, those pins are so cute.

03:17.801 --> 03:18.867
Ow.

03:18.869 --> 03:20.869
Not so fast. Pins
are eight bucks.

03:20.871 --> 03:23.972
I'm not giving you eight
bucks for a pin of me.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.640
Fine.

03:25.642 --> 03:26.741
Five bucks.

03:28.678 --> 03:29.744
Okay.

03:34.951 --> 03:37.519
Why are you guys dressed
like astronaut beekeepers?

03:37.521 --> 03:39.054
These are fencing uniforms.

03:39.056 --> 03:40.555
Fencing wasn't very fun.

03:40.557 --> 03:41.957
So, then we tried kebabing.

03:43.526 --> 03:44.659
Mm-mm.

03:44.661 --> 03:48.163
I have to find a hobby I'm as
passionate about as music.

03:48.165 --> 03:49.831
What about me?

03:49.833 --> 03:52.534
I know. Besides you.

03:52.536 --> 03:53.723
Okay.

03:53.754 --> 03:58.473
Making music was also an excuse to avoid
working at Moon's Mattress Kingdom.

03:58.475 --> 03:59.420
And now I don't have that.

03:59.451 --> 04:02.110
Are your parents still pressuring
you to come work at the store?

04:02.112 --> 04:04.112
Look at this note they put
in my lunch box today.

04:10.694 --> 04:13.054
"Hugs and kisses. Enjoy your
bologna sandwich, sweetie bear.

04:13.056 --> 04:15.190
P.S. Come work at the
mattress store."

04:15.192 --> 04:17.058
They won't stop pressuring me.

04:17.060 --> 04:20.128
This morning, they made me pancakes
shaped like little mattresses,

04:20.130 --> 04:23.064
with little butter pillows
and tiny bacon people...

04:23.066 --> 04:24.199
It was actually
really delicious.

04:24.201 --> 04:25.934
But I can't work
with my mom and dad!

04:25.936 --> 04:28.169
Yeah, your parents
are the worst.

04:28.171 --> 04:29.504
No, I love them.

04:29.506 --> 04:31.573
Yeah, your parents are the best!

04:33.909 --> 04:37.712
It's just, once I start working there, I'm
gonna be sucked into the family business,

04:37.714 --> 04:39.017
and they'll never let me go.
Ever.

04:39.041 --> 04:41.983
It's not like some Trish job where I
can just get fired after an hour.

04:41.985 --> 04:43.118
No offense, Trish.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.186
Why would I be offended
by a compliment?

04:46.122 --> 04:48.223
Austin, I think
you're overthinking.

04:48.225 --> 04:50.592
Is working there really
that big of a deal?

04:51.994 --> 04:55.063
Ally, clearly, Austin's
come to terms with the fact

04:55.065 --> 04:58.199
that his music career
is officially over.

04:58.201 --> 05:00.702
Symbolically, going to
work for his parents

05:00.704 --> 05:03.032
means that he's giving
up any hope that he'll

05:03.063 --> 05:05.036
ever be able to make
music ever again.

05:06.809 --> 05:08.143
Right, buddy?

05:08.145 --> 05:09.544
Aw.

05:09.546 --> 05:11.046
Shrimp kebab?

05:15.051 --> 05:16.584
I'm worried about Austin.

05:16.586 --> 05:19.487
I'm worried I'm not
gonna make any money.

05:19.489 --> 05:22.857
"Music lessons are for people
who want music lessons only."

05:22.859 --> 05:25.560
This sign is gonna kill
my merch business.

05:25.562 --> 05:29.831
I mean, Dez and Austin have been
trying different hobbies all week.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.267
But nothing seems to stick.

05:32.269 --> 05:33.601
That's where you're wrong.

05:33.632 --> 05:38.006
Apparently, when you're gluing birdhouses,
it's not a good idea to high five.

05:38.008 --> 05:40.008
And definitely don't
sit on the birdhouse.

05:42.535 --> 05:43.775
What am I gonna do now?

05:43.805 --> 05:46.244
Well, I certainly wouldn't
recommend going to the bathroom.

05:48.117 --> 05:50.518
No, I mean about
finding a hobby.

05:50.520 --> 05:53.521
My parents want me to start work at
the mattress store this afternoon.

05:53.523 --> 05:55.824
And right now, I have
no excuse to say no.

05:57.593 --> 05:59.094
- Haha, yeah!
- All right!

05:59.096 --> 06:00.862
Aw...

06:00.864 --> 06:02.130
Well, we'll help.

06:02.132 --> 06:03.531
Uh, let's brainstorm.

06:03.533 --> 06:05.667
What about... cooking?

06:06.602 --> 06:09.070
Hmm, cooking...

06:22.745 --> 06:23.985
<i>Private detective-ing?</i>

06:28.325 --> 06:29.991
<i>Irish stepdancing?</i>

06:33.162 --> 06:34.696
<i>Competitive mustache growing?</i>

06:42.972 --> 06:45.039
I don't want to do
any of those things.

06:45.041 --> 06:46.841
This is so frustrating.

06:48.611 --> 06:49.978
Oh, I've got it!

06:49.980 --> 06:52.680
Why don't you get a job at
a different mattress store

06:52.682 --> 06:55.817
and tell your parents you can't work with
them because they're the competition?

06:55.819 --> 07:00.021
Dez, I'd still be working at a mattress
store, and my parents would hate me.

07:00.023 --> 07:02.590
You're right. I'm such a doof.

07:02.592 --> 07:03.625
Aw.

07:03.627 --> 07:06.227
No one's arguing with that.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.101
Welcome to Moon's
Mattress Kingdom.

07:13.103 --> 07:15.170
There's no hassle in our castle.

07:19.074 --> 07:20.909
That's my boy!

07:22.077 --> 07:24.245
This is the happiest
day of my life.

07:24.247 --> 07:27.115
Next time, try to be
a little peppier.

07:34.924 --> 07:37.091
And even though this
waterbed is just a queen,

07:37.093 --> 07:39.027
when you sleep in it,
you'll feel like a king.

07:39.029 --> 07:40.094
Puffy penguin pillow.

07:43.934 --> 07:47.735
And if you buy a waterbed today, we'll
throw in this puffy penguin pillow.

07:49.805 --> 07:52.040
Ugh, this cotton
candy is terrible.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.709
That's mattress stuffing.

07:54.711 --> 07:56.077
Then it's actually pretty good.

07:58.147 --> 08:00.482
This waterbed is
snoring my name.

08:00.484 --> 08:02.116
- I'm gonna buy it...
- Yes!

08:02.118 --> 08:05.086
From this discount
waterbed seller online.

08:05.088 --> 08:06.120
What?

08:06.122 --> 08:08.122
Wait a sec...

08:08.124 --> 08:10.091
Didn't you use to
be Austin Moon?

08:10.093 --> 08:13.361
Well, actually, I
still am Austin Moon.

08:13.363 --> 08:16.231
I'm just not allowed to make music
anymore, so now I'm working here.

08:17.233 --> 08:19.968
That is the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

08:19.970 --> 08:20.764
You know what?

08:20.795 --> 08:23.938
I am gonna buy this waterbed
from you purely out of pity.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.139
- Yes!
- You did it!

08:25.141 --> 08:26.141
Pity!

08:29.212 --> 08:32.212
They're just making a big deal
'cause this is my first sale.

08:32.215 --> 08:35.082
Not true. We do that
for every sale.

08:35.085 --> 08:36.323
Oh, I'm so proud of you!

08:36.354 --> 08:38.546
We've always dreamed
of the day when our

08:38.577 --> 08:41.121
little bedbug would join
our family business.

08:41.124 --> 08:45.159
We used to lie away at night, not
from an uncomfortable mattress,

08:45.161 --> 08:48.029
but from worrying who would
rule over this kingdom

08:48.031 --> 08:50.098
once we stepped down
from our thrones.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.934
Oh, our little prince.

08:52.936 --> 08:54.302
Now clean up this
confetti, okay?

08:58.007 --> 09:00.141
Whoo!

09:00.143 --> 09:02.043
Dez!

09:04.914 --> 09:06.714
Hi, Ally.

09:06.716 --> 09:09.183
Lily, you decided
to take lessons?

09:09.185 --> 09:12.420
No. I just wanted you to autograph
this, so I could hang it on my wall.

09:14.056 --> 09:16.457
But wait. Didn't you
think about what I said?

09:16.459 --> 09:19.894
Yeah, yeah. Unicorn. Rainbow.
Cotton candy.

09:19.896 --> 09:21.195
Can you just sign it, please?

09:23.198 --> 09:25.166
Of course. Here you go.

09:27.036 --> 09:28.903
Thank you.

09:28.905 --> 09:31.039
Mmm, I'm exhausted.

09:31.041 --> 09:35.243
I recorded a song, did three radio
interviews, and gave ten lessons today.

09:35.245 --> 09:37.111
I can't wait to just
go home and sleep.

09:37.113 --> 09:40.148
You can't go home now. You still
have two more songs to write.

09:40.150 --> 09:41.831
I don't know if I
can keep this up.

09:41.862 --> 09:46.154
Last night, I was so tired, I fell asleep
on the bus ride home and missed my stop.

09:46.156 --> 09:48.056
You don't take the bus.

09:49.091 --> 09:53.061
I know. I was so tired, I
forgot how I usually get home.

09:54.296 --> 09:55.363
Hey, guys.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.170
So, how was your
first day at work?

09:58.200 --> 10:01.035
I can't believe I'm gonna be working
there for the rest of my life.

10:01.037 --> 10:02.870
I got a puffy penguin pillow.

10:03.939 --> 10:05.340
I named him Waddlesworth.

10:08.143 --> 10:08.917
Mmm.

10:08.948 --> 10:12.043
This puffy penguin
pillow is comfy.

10:14.149 --> 10:16.150
Oh, Morgan!

10:16.152 --> 10:18.052
I forgot I had another lesson.

10:18.054 --> 10:20.054
Listen, is there any
way we can reschedule?

10:20.056 --> 10:23.057
- I have so much to do, and I am so tired.
- Hey.

10:23.059 --> 10:24.459
Maybe I could give the lesson?

10:24.461 --> 10:26.461
Really, Austin? Are you sure?

10:26.463 --> 10:28.796
Yeah. Yeah, no problem.

10:28.798 --> 10:30.198
Sounds kinda fun, actually.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.033
Come on, dude. Let's rock.

10:32.035 --> 10:34.068
Thanks, Austin.

10:34.070 --> 10:37.138
If I hurry now, I can
still catch my bus.

10:37.140 --> 10:38.873
Wait!

10:38.875 --> 10:40.141
You don't take the...

10:40.143 --> 10:41.809
Eh, she'll get home somehow.

10:45.280 --> 10:46.914
She took Waddlesworth.

10:52.488 --> 10:55.056
Keep working on your scales, Lindsay.
I'll see you next week.

10:55.058 --> 10:56.257
Hey, guys.

10:56.259 --> 10:57.006
Austin.

10:57.037 --> 10:59.994
Thanks so much for helping me
out with all these lessons.

10:59.996 --> 11:02.096
Are you kidding? I'm
having a blast!

11:02.098 --> 11:03.598
I love working with these kids.

11:03.600 --> 11:06.100
I totally get how you feel.

11:06.102 --> 11:08.336
Except for the working part.

11:08.338 --> 11:10.204
And the kids part.

11:11.840 --> 11:14.464
You know what? I think
giving lessons was the

11:14.476 --> 11:17.111
hobby you were looking
for this whole time.

11:17.113 --> 11:20.915
You're right. This is the
thing I've been looking for.

11:20.917 --> 11:24.085
If I can't perform music,
I can teach music.

11:24.087 --> 11:27.321
Too bad you're stuck working at your
parents' mattress store forever.

11:27.323 --> 11:31.092
And ever, and ever, and
ever, and ever, and ever...

11:31.094 --> 11:32.627
No, I'm not!

11:33.962 --> 11:36.724
I'm gonna go down to Moon's Mattress
Kingdom, and I'm gonna quit.

11:36.755 --> 11:39.100
And there's nothing they
can say that will stop me.

11:39.102 --> 11:41.536
You're getting a promotion!

11:41.538 --> 11:44.105
I was not expecting that.

11:44.107 --> 11:47.241
Austin, as you know, since
you started working here,

11:47.243 --> 11:50.978
your mother and I have been happier
than bunnies on a box spring.

11:50.980 --> 11:54.515
When you joined the family business,
you joined a long line of Moons

11:54.517 --> 11:58.186
who devoted their entire
lives to selling mattresses.

11:58.188 --> 11:59.620
We've never been prouder.

12:00.622 --> 12:01.589
Great.

12:01.591 --> 12:03.524
So fun...

12:03.526 --> 12:05.593
Mattresses...

12:05.595 --> 12:08.062
Entire life...

12:08.064 --> 12:12.166
Whatever you say, son, we can
tell you're excited to be here.

12:13.635 --> 12:16.437
We have a surprise for you.

12:16.439 --> 12:19.474
This crown was given
to me by my father.

12:19.476 --> 12:21.375
And it was given to
him by his father.

12:21.377 --> 12:25.346
And it was given to my father's
father, by his father's father.

12:25.348 --> 12:28.983
I know. They all
still work here.

12:32.187 --> 12:35.123
Austin Moon, we
hereby crown you:

12:35.125 --> 12:37.325
King of Moon's Mattress Kingdom!

12:50.306 --> 12:51.737
What do you mean
you didn't quit?

12:51.768 --> 12:55.107
Ha! I told you he was too much of a
'fraidy-cat to go through with it!

12:56.579 --> 12:58.480
Whoops. I meant to whisper that.

12:58.482 --> 13:01.762
Ha! I told you he was too big of a
'fraidy-cat to go through with it!

13:03.453 --> 13:04.645
I just couldn't quit.

13:04.676 --> 13:08.420
My parents are happier than
"bunnies on a box spring."

13:09.692 --> 13:12.261
Aw. Bunnies on a box spring.

13:12.263 --> 13:14.229
What's happier than that?

13:14.231 --> 13:16.465
Ooh! Well, maybe
duckies on a duvet?

13:16.467 --> 13:17.666
Or puppies on a pillow top?

13:17.668 --> 13:20.202
- Or ferrets on a featherbed?
- Ally!

13:20.204 --> 13:22.171
This is serious.
They made me king.

13:22.173 --> 13:26.041
Well, there's a simple
solution, your majesty.

13:26.043 --> 13:28.243
If you can't quit,
you've gotta get fired.

13:28.245 --> 13:32.047
And lucky for you, no one knows
more about getting fired than me.

13:33.550 --> 13:35.284
You really shouldn't
be proud of that.

13:36.686 --> 13:38.487
And yet, I am.

13:43.092 --> 13:43.773
Okay, Austin.

13:43.804 --> 13:46.495
You may be the king of
Moon's Mattress Kingdom,

13:46.497 --> 13:49.331
but I am the queen
of getting fired.

13:49.333 --> 13:51.700
I've been fired from 73 jobs.

13:51.702 --> 13:53.669
And, the thing I've been
fired for the most is...

13:53.671 --> 13:54.703
Being late?

13:54.705 --> 13:56.538
No.

13:56.540 --> 13:58.273
The number one thing I've
been fired for is...

13:58.275 --> 13:59.508
Bad attitude?

13:59.510 --> 14:00.475
No!

14:00.477 --> 14:02.411
Talking back to the boss?

14:02.413 --> 14:04.780
Putting gum under the counter?
Leaving early? Too gassy?

14:04.782 --> 14:07.249
Making personal phone calls?
Fighting with the customers!

14:07.251 --> 14:09.117
Forgetting to feed the fish?
Eating all the pretzels?

14:09.119 --> 14:10.485
Impersonating a health
food inspector?

14:10.487 --> 14:12.487
Calling the boss "Lisa" when
his name is actually "Ted"?

14:12.489 --> 14:14.289
Please stop guessing.

14:15.225 --> 14:17.426
- Sleeping on the job?
- No!

14:17.428 --> 14:20.128
Actually, yes!
Sleeping on the job.

14:20.130 --> 14:22.197
I knew it! I'm such
a good guesser.

14:23.499 --> 14:26.568
So, you think my parents will fire
me if they catch me sleeping?

14:26.570 --> 14:28.604
Oh yeah.

14:33.409 --> 14:35.577
Austin Monica Moon.

14:37.547 --> 14:39.081
Did I fall asleep?

14:39.083 --> 14:43.252
Oh, no. You guys must be mad...

14:43.254 --> 14:47.289
Mad? No way! This is
a brilliant idea!

14:47.291 --> 14:51.126
It's a great way to demonstrate how
comfortable our mattresses are!

14:51.128 --> 14:52.494
But... Seriously?

14:52.496 --> 14:55.330
While you were sleeping,
we sold three of these.

15:00.837 --> 15:03.171
Sorry, Austin, that
usually works.

15:03.173 --> 15:05.207
Don't panic. We'll
get you fired.

15:05.209 --> 15:08.343
Dez, what are you doing? You're
getting crumbs everywhere!

15:10.114 --> 15:12.681
That's a great idea!

15:12.683 --> 15:15.450
No one's going to want to buy
a mattress with crumbs in it.

15:15.452 --> 15:18.487
If Austin's parents catch him
making a mess in the beds,

15:18.489 --> 15:20.289
they'll definitely
want to fire him.

15:20.291 --> 15:24.159
Yeah. That was totally
my idea the whole time.

15:24.161 --> 15:25.394
I'm not just snacking.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.205
Austin Monica Moon!

15:37.207 --> 15:39.408
Are you eating crackers in bed?

15:39.410 --> 15:42.711
Yep. It would appear that
is exactly what I'm doing.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.315
You are...

15:46.317 --> 15:47.582
A genius!

15:49.252 --> 15:50.093
Huh?

15:50.124 --> 15:53.455
It's the perfect way to demonstrate
these new suck-u-tron mattresses

15:53.457 --> 15:55.524
with built-in vacuum hoses.

16:09.238 --> 16:10.839
- Hi, Ally.
- Aah!

16:10.841 --> 16:12.841
What? Lily!

16:14.210 --> 16:16.345
Are you here for
more autographs?

16:16.347 --> 16:19.648
No. I decided that I really
wanted to take piano lessons.

16:19.650 --> 16:22.184
Because of what I said?

16:22.186 --> 16:25.520
I motivated you to
want to make music?

16:25.522 --> 16:27.356
No, my mom's making me.

16:29.625 --> 16:30.792
Oh.

16:30.794 --> 16:32.461
I'm kidding. It's what you said.

16:32.463 --> 16:35.430
I knew it!

16:35.432 --> 16:36.730
I wanna be just like you.

16:36.761 --> 16:40.936
I wanna perform on stage for thousands
of people and sell tons of albums...

16:40.938 --> 16:41.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

16:41.821 --> 16:43.939
You're getting a little
ahead of yourself.

16:43.941 --> 16:46.490
You don't just become a
performer overnight.

16:46.521 --> 16:51.646
You have to learn how to play music, sing,
write songs, perform in front of a crowd.

16:51.648 --> 16:53.749
Can you teach me all
that stuff, too?

16:53.751 --> 16:55.183
No.

16:55.185 --> 16:57.285
Well, I could, but...

16:58.354 --> 17:00.022
Actually...

17:00.024 --> 17:01.723
I don't know.

17:01.725 --> 17:02.791
Wait.

17:02.793 --> 17:03.925
Yeah, I could.

17:05.228 --> 17:06.261
Or could I?

17:06.262 --> 17:07.963
Maybe!

17:07.964 --> 17:09.798
Well, not by myself.

17:09.800 --> 17:11.599
We all could do it!

17:11.602 --> 17:14.803
Sorry. I'm having a really
hard time following you.

17:14.805 --> 17:17.271
I gotta get to the
mattress store.

17:20.977 --> 17:24.546
So... I'll come back
for my lesson later?

17:28.518 --> 17:29.272
Hey, guys!

17:29.303 --> 17:32.287
Hey, Ally. We're mixing up all
the price tags on the beds.

17:32.289 --> 17:32.983
Whoo!

17:33.014 --> 17:35.757
That's what got me fired
from the jewelry store.

17:35.759 --> 17:38.827
Well, after I sold a
$300 ring for two bucks.

17:38.829 --> 17:43.365
Once my parents see this "mistake," I'll
have all my time free to give lessons.

17:43.367 --> 17:44.933
Well, about that... guys!

17:44.935 --> 17:47.002
I think I have a great idea.

17:47.004 --> 17:49.504
What if instead of just
giving kids music lessons,

17:49.506 --> 17:53.275
we taught kids everything there is
to know about making it in music?

17:53.277 --> 17:54.810
Yeah, that's a great idea!

17:54.812 --> 17:56.978
We can teach them how to
write songs, how to dance...

17:56.980 --> 18:00.015
Exactly! We can start
our own music factory.

18:00.017 --> 18:01.716
Well, we can all do it together!

18:01.718 --> 18:04.586
I can teach kids about booking
gigs or putting on concerts.

18:04.588 --> 18:06.321
I can show kids how
to make music videos.

18:06.323 --> 18:08.457
And teach them how
to dress cool.

18:09.992 --> 18:11.026
- Right.
- Sure.

18:11.028 --> 18:12.294
Don't think so.

18:15.331 --> 18:17.265
Dez, what are you doing?
That's a waterbed!

18:17.267 --> 18:19.734
Uh, yeah. This will
totally get you fired.

18:19.736 --> 18:21.937
No, no, no, stop doing that!

18:23.806 --> 18:26.842
This is great! I should have thought
of popping the waterbed sooner!

18:26.844 --> 18:30.312
What? This isn't great! I wanna get
fired, not ruin the whole store!

18:30.314 --> 18:31.813
Guys, the holes are
getting bigger!

18:31.815 --> 18:33.048
- Aah!
- Ugh.

18:34.784 --> 18:37.285
I'll use the suck-u-tron to
vacuum up all the water.

18:38.754 --> 18:40.288
It's working!

18:41.457 --> 18:42.991
What is that hose attached to?

18:42.993 --> 18:44.826
That mattress over there.

18:50.066 --> 18:52.834
You know what's gonna happen if
that fills up with too much water!

19:04.847 --> 19:06.581
Oh. The mattress will pop!

19:09.552 --> 19:12.454
Austin Monica Moon!

19:12.456 --> 19:14.656
Dez Hatfield Wade!

19:14.658 --> 19:18.760
Patricia Maria de la R-r-rosa!

19:18.762 --> 19:21.096
Ally Elizabeth Dawson!

19:21.098 --> 19:22.931
That's not my middle name.

19:22.933 --> 19:23.999
Whatever!

19:25.368 --> 19:28.103
Austin, look what you've done!

19:28.105 --> 19:30.605
I'm really sorry.

19:30.607 --> 19:33.642
We don't want to do this, but
you have left us no choice.

19:33.644 --> 19:34.676
You are...

19:34.678 --> 19:35.877
Fired?

19:35.879 --> 19:37.679
What? No!

19:37.681 --> 19:40.415
You're gonna stay late
and clean up this mess.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.684
Seriously? That's it?

19:42.686 --> 19:45.554
Oh, honey, everybody that's
worked at a mattress store

19:45.556 --> 19:48.557
has accidentally stapled a
waterbed at some point.

19:48.559 --> 19:49.824
Really?

19:49.826 --> 19:51.059
Guilty.

19:52.762 --> 19:56.464
Austin, obviously we gave you
too much responsibility.

19:56.466 --> 20:00.368
Don't feel bad. You'll have
years and years to get better.

20:00.370 --> 20:02.470
Years and years.

20:05.007 --> 20:06.474
No, I won't.

20:06.476 --> 20:08.009
Because...

20:08.011 --> 20:09.077
I have to quit!

20:11.647 --> 20:13.715
Look what you've
done to your mother!

20:13.717 --> 20:16.051
I'm sorry.

20:16.053 --> 20:17.919
I love you guys...

20:17.921 --> 20:19.387
And mattresses.

20:19.389 --> 20:21.389
But my heart's in making music.

20:22.959 --> 20:25.060
I've been giving lessons
at Sonic Boom after work.

20:25.062 --> 20:26.561
And that's what I
want to do full-time.

20:26.563 --> 20:29.831
We're gonna start our
own music academy.

20:33.002 --> 20:36.004
Son, we know how you
feel about music.

20:36.006 --> 20:40.609
We don't want to come between you and your
dream like some kind of a lumpy pillow.

20:40.611 --> 20:44.079
We'll be proud of you no
matter what you decide to do.

20:44.081 --> 20:45.981
You have our firmest support.

20:45.983 --> 20:48.817
And that comes with a
lifetime guarantee.

20:48.819 --> 20:51.152
Bring it in, Moons!

20:59.662 --> 21:04.199
Oh, dad. Thank you so much for letting us
turn Sonic Boom into our music factory.

21:04.201 --> 21:07.702
Oh, you're welcome, sweetie. I mean,
we weren't selling that much anyway.

21:07.704 --> 21:08.937
And I'm really excited
for you guys.

21:08.939 --> 21:09.839
It's gonna be awesome!

21:09.870 --> 21:12.006
We're gonna put recording
booths back there,

21:12.037 --> 21:14.142
a stage over there, dance
studio upstairs...

21:14.173 --> 21:17.475
Oh, and don't forget about my
private nap area and steam room.

21:18.447 --> 21:19.481
Trish...

21:19.483 --> 21:22.150
Fine. No steam room.

21:23.552 --> 21:25.720
Ooh, be sure to save
room for my giant

21:25.722 --> 21:28.990
"giraffes teaching other
giraffes to play music" mural.

21:28.992 --> 21:30.959
Well, we can discuss.

21:30.961 --> 21:32.460
Maybe in the bathroom.

21:33.529 --> 21:36.765
Well, I guess it's time to
kiss the Sonic Boom goodbye.

21:36.767 --> 21:37.832
- What?
- Aah!

21:37.834 --> 21:40.635
- Dez!
- No, Dez!

21:40.637 --> 21:43.071
- No, stop!
- Dez!

21:43.073 --> 21:44.205
- Dez!
- Dez, no!

21:44.207 --> 21:46.107
- Hey!
- Dez!

21:46.109 --> 21:47.776
What are you doing?

21:47.778 --> 21:49.144
- Dez, no!
- No!

21:49.146 --> 21:50.712
- Hey!
- Stop it!

21:50.714 --> 21:51.913
- Dez!
- No, Dez!

21:51.915 --> 21:53.848
Aah!

21:53.850 --> 21:55.050
Aah!

21:55.052 --> 21:56.251
- Dez!
- No, no, no, no!

21:56.253 --> 21:58.119
- Dez, no!
- No?

21:58.121 --> 22:01.723
We are not destroying anything.
We're just redecorating!

22:04.060 --> 22:05.126
Oh.

22:07.563 --> 22:09.603
Then you might not wanna go
up to the practice room.

22:11.500 --> 22:12.801
Or out to your car, Mr. Dawson.

22:14.637 --> 22:16.004
You smashed my car?

22:16.006 --> 22:18.940
Well, I had to test the
sledgehammer on something.

22:20.609 --> 22:22.877
Oh, my car!
