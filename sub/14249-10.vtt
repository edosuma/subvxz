00:04.304 --> 00:07.796
Ten months ago, the crew
of Voyager was pulled

00:07.874 --> 00:10.342
into the Delta Quadrant by an
entity known as the Caretaker.

00:10.410 --> 00:11.877
Not enough time!

00:11.945 --> 00:14.937
When he died, Voyager's
best chance of getting home

00:15.015 --> 00:19.384
died with him, but he revealed
one hopeful possibility.

00:19.452 --> 00:20.384
There is another like me.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.387
She left hundreds of years ago,

00:22.455 --> 00:24.923
but she's out there, somewhere.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:50.417 --> 00:54.911
Open yourself
to the impressions around you--

00:54.988 --> 00:57.013
the thoughts...

00:57.090 --> 01:00.025
the minds that are on this ship.

01:02.629 --> 01:04.596
What do you hear?

01:08.001 --> 01:09.969
Voices.

01:10.036 --> 01:12.698
So many voices.

01:12.772 --> 01:14.740
l believe you are sensing

01:14.808 --> 01:18.073
the thoughts of various
crew members on board.

01:18.144 --> 01:19.771
What should l do?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.974
See if you can isolate
one of the voices.

01:23.049 --> 01:26.280
lmagine you are
listening to a symphony

01:26.352 --> 01:30.880
and focusing
on a single instrument.

01:30.957 --> 01:32.948
lt's working.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.723
Try to maintain
your emotional equanimity.

01:36.796 --> 01:40.732
You should not be concerned
with success or failure.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.131
Uh-oh.

01:42.202 --> 01:43.897
He's taking off too much.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.996
l told him just a few
millimeters off the top.

01:47.140 --> 01:48.664
Way too much now.

01:48.741 --> 01:50.709
Don't touch the sideburns.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.142
lt's Neelix!

01:52.212 --> 01:54.146
l can hear Neelix's thoughts.

01:54.214 --> 01:56.978
That is not unexpected.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.608
You have an emotional
attachment to him

01:58.685 --> 02:00.778
which may have
drawn your focus.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.549
My scalp itches.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.921
Maybe l should tell him
about that shampoo of his.

02:05.992 --> 02:07.926
l think he's getting a haircut.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.588
Oh, no! He's trimming
the ear hairs.

02:10.663 --> 02:13.757
l told him the ear hairs
are the perfect length.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.266
Not the ear hairs!

02:17.437 --> 02:19.234
lf you are to succeed

02:19.305 --> 02:21.569
in honing
your telepathic abilities,

02:21.641 --> 02:24.974
you must learn to control
these emotional outbursts.

02:25.044 --> 02:26.978
Outburst?

02:27.046 --> 02:29.071
lt was a giggle.

02:32.185 --> 02:35.780
Tomorrow, l will teach you
a Vulcan mind-control technique

02:35.855 --> 02:38.346
that will help you
inhibit your giggles.

02:41.528 --> 02:42.995
Thanks, Tuvok.

02:43.062 --> 02:44.529
You may go.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.470
You're late.

02:51.538 --> 02:53.529
Sorry. My lesson
with Lieutenant Tuvok

02:53.606 --> 02:55.164
went a little long today.

02:55.241 --> 02:57.038
Today, yesterday
and the day before.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.079
You'd think a Vulcan would be
more attuned to punctuality.

03:00.146 --> 03:03.172
l'll try to keep a closer eye
on the time from now on.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.511
So, how was school today?

03:04.584 --> 03:07.348
Wonderful. Tuvok helped me
with a sensory focus exercise,

03:07.420 --> 03:09.183
we worked
on my precognitive skills,

03:09.255 --> 03:12.122
and l learned how to self-induce
a hypergogic mental state.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.921
Sounds stimulating.

03:13.993 --> 03:16.393
He says l'm making
excellent progress.

03:18.631 --> 03:22.260
l had no doubt that you would,
but l'd appreciate it

03:22.335 --> 03:24.929
if you wouldn't let
these... mind studies

03:25.004 --> 03:26.801
interfere with your...

03:31.511 --> 03:32.978
What's that?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.570
l don't know.

06:04.163 --> 06:05.858
Life-signs?

06:05.932 --> 06:07.126
Apparently so.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.134
But before l could analyze them,

06:09.202 --> 06:10.965
the life-signs simply ceased.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.973
l'm scanning the remains on
all biospectral frequencies.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.374
lt's completely inert.
Dead.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.378
Somehow, l find it
hard to believe

06:20.446 --> 06:22.710
this rock suddenly came to life
for several seconds.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.147
l concur.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.912
However, dead or alive,

06:25.985 --> 06:27.850
these are the remains
of an alien entity

06:27.920 --> 06:29.512
we never fully understood.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.022
lt may be prudent to place it

06:31.090 --> 06:33.081
in a level-3 biohazard
containment field.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.354
Agreed-- but first,
l want to take a look at...

06:38.064 --> 06:39.725
l'm picking up life-signs.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.130
They're sporocystian.

06:41.200 --> 06:43.691
The Caretaker was
a sporocystian life-form.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.238
But, according to my readings,

06:46.305 --> 06:48.239
the life signs aren't coming
from the remains.

06:48.307 --> 06:49.774
The remains
are simply resonating

06:49.842 --> 06:52.367
in response
to an external energy source--

06:52.445 --> 06:53.810
some other life-form.

06:53.880 --> 06:55.108
Where?

06:55.181 --> 06:56.273
Let's find out.

06:56.349 --> 06:57.543
Janeway to Bridge.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.450
Mr. Kim, begin scans
for a sporocystian life-form.

07:00.520 --> 07:02.283
Aye, Captain. Stand by.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.459
l've got it, Captain.

07:07.527 --> 07:09.358
A sporocystian energy burst

07:09.429 --> 07:11.954
approximately
ten light-years distant.

07:12.031 --> 07:15.296
But l can't get a precise fix
on its location.

07:18.704 --> 07:20.638
The life-signs are gone.

07:20.706 --> 07:23.402
These remains
could be responding

07:23.476 --> 07:25.410
to the Caretaker's mate.

07:25.478 --> 07:30.279
lf that's true, maybe we could
use them to track her down.

07:30.349 --> 07:33.011
And if we can find her,
she might have

07:33.085 --> 07:35.053
the ability to send us home.

07:38.758 --> 07:39.850
Torres to Janeway.

07:39.926 --> 07:40.915
Go ahead.

07:40.993 --> 07:42.460
We've placed the remains

07:42.528 --> 07:44.052
in a hexiprismatic field,
Captain.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.099
The next time it responds to
sporocystian energy, the field

07:47.166 --> 07:49.191
should give us a heading
to the source.

07:49.268 --> 07:50.929
You're using the remains
like a compass.

07:51.003 --> 07:51.867
Exactly.

07:51.938 --> 07:52.905
Good work.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.200
Keep us apprised.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.104
Janeway out.

07:57.710 --> 08:00.201
Captain, the Caretaker
was a being

08:00.279 --> 08:01.576
of considerable power,

08:01.647 --> 08:03.808
and although his intent
was not hostile,

08:03.883 --> 08:05.851
we were essentially
at his mercy.

08:05.918 --> 08:08.352
l do not care to repeat
that experience.

08:08.421 --> 08:10.651
And if we are
about to meet his mate,

08:10.723 --> 08:12.452
you'd like it to be
on more even ground.

08:12.525 --> 08:13.583
Precisely.

08:13.659 --> 08:14.956
l have studied the Doctor's

08:15.027 --> 08:17.325
biochemical analysis
of the Caretaker remains,

08:17.396 --> 08:20.627
and l believe it is possible
to create a sporocystian toxin--

08:20.700 --> 08:23.294
something which might
debilitate the life-form.

08:27.406 --> 08:28.964
Sounds like
a sensible precaution.

08:29.041 --> 08:30.372
Get on it.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.179
l'm picking up
sporocystian energy.

08:34.246 --> 08:35.509
Chakotay to Engineering.

08:35.581 --> 08:36.912
We're picking up life-signs.

08:37.015 --> 08:38.313
ls your compass working?

08:38.384 --> 08:39.316
Stand by.

08:39.385 --> 08:41.148
Activate the field.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.683
l can't get a bearing
on the source.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.920
Try increasing
the spatial resolution.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.759
Spatial resolution at maximum.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.322
The life-signs are fading,
and l still can't get

08:54.400 --> 08:56.197
a lock on the coordinates.

08:56.269 --> 08:58.169
Boosting the signal gain.

09:00.339 --> 09:01.806
We've got it, Captain.

09:01.874 --> 09:04.342
Bearing 272 mark 19.

09:04.410 --> 09:06.173
Acknowledged.

09:06.245 --> 09:09.942
Mr. Paris, set a course
and engage at maximum warp.

09:10.016 --> 09:11.313
Aye, Captain.

09:19.692 --> 09:22.388
Captain, we're picking up
an artificial structure

09:22.461 --> 09:24.691
on long-range sensors.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.631
lt appears to be
a space station of some kind.

09:27.700 --> 09:29.565
Slow to impulse
and put it on screen.

09:37.643 --> 09:39.975
That looks a lot like
the Caretaker's Array.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.037
The configuration is similar.

09:44.617 --> 09:46.141
So is the surface composition,

09:46.218 --> 09:48.083
but it's only
about one-tenth the size.

09:48.154 --> 09:51.089
Are there any sporocystian
life-forms on board?

09:51.157 --> 09:56.117
No, but l am picking up over
2,000 carbon-based life-forms.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.696
They appear to be...

09:58.764 --> 10:00.857
Wait a second.

10:00.933 --> 10:02.958
Confirming.

10:04.437 --> 10:06.405
Captain...

10:06.472 --> 10:08.372
they're Ocampa.

10:10.176 --> 10:11.734
We're approaching
the station, Captain.

10:11.811 --> 10:13.108
All stop.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.806
Hail them, Mr. Tuvok.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.982
No response.

10:18.050 --> 10:21.178
l am reading an energy surge
from the station--

10:21.253 --> 10:22.515
possibly weapons.

10:22.588 --> 10:23.680
Shields.

10:29.028 --> 10:31.087
Definitely weapons.

10:31.163 --> 10:32.687
Shields are holding.

10:32.765 --> 10:33.857
lncoming message from the Array.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.264
Let's hear it.

10:37.737 --> 10:39.432
You're not wanted here.

10:43.342 --> 10:44.934
We pose no threat to you.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.309
l'm Captain Kathryn
Janeway of the...

10:47.380 --> 10:48.847
You have been warned!

11:03.729 --> 11:05.196
They are Ocampa?

11:05.264 --> 11:06.196
That's right.

11:06.265 --> 11:09.132
There appears to be
an entire colony.

11:09.201 --> 11:11.135
And, according to our sensors,

11:11.203 --> 11:14.297
the station is
at least 300 years old.

11:14.373 --> 11:16.341
Kes, is there any Ocampa history

11:16.409 --> 11:18.343
about people
who left your planet

11:18.411 --> 11:21.676
or were captured by aliens
and taken away?

11:21.747 --> 11:22.975
No.

11:23.049 --> 11:25.279
The idea
that there could be Ocampa

11:25.351 --> 11:26.943
anywhere but on the homeworld

11:27.019 --> 11:28.953
is something
no one ever considered.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.251
l thought l was the only one.

11:31.323 --> 11:34.383
Since you're definitely
the only one on Voyager,

11:34.460 --> 11:36.655
l want you to act
as an intermediary.

11:36.729 --> 11:37.991
Gladly.

11:38.064 --> 11:39.361
What should l do?

11:39.432 --> 11:41.696
The first step
is to arrange a meeting.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.598
Let's see
if we can get that far.

11:43.669 --> 11:45.136
Hail the Array.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.430
This is becoming tiresome,
Captain.

11:48.507 --> 11:50.907
lf you force us to take
further aggressive action...

11:50.976 --> 11:54.377
l have someone here
who wishes to speak with you.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.679
My name is Kes.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.211
l'm an Ocampa.

12:03.255 --> 12:06.190
This is some kind of trick.

12:06.258 --> 12:08.021
l assure you it's not a trick.

12:08.094 --> 12:11.530
What would an Ocampa be doing
on an alien starship?

12:11.597 --> 12:13.531
lt's a long story.

12:13.599 --> 12:16.796
But l'd like to know
what an Ocampa is doing

12:16.869 --> 12:18.632
on an alien space station.

12:18.704 --> 12:21.332
That is also a long story.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.934
Then l suggest we meet
and tell each other our stories.

12:25.077 --> 12:27.307
May we come aboard
your station?

12:27.379 --> 12:30.837
No, but l am willing
to come to your ship.

12:38.257 --> 12:39.849
Our readings identified

12:39.925 --> 12:42.155
a sporocystian life-form
in this area.

12:42.228 --> 12:44.890
We've been looking for
that life-form for months.

12:44.964 --> 12:47.262
Why? To destroy it?

12:47.333 --> 12:48.857
No.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.199
On the contrary, we believe
it has the technology

12:52.271 --> 12:54.239
that could send us home.

12:54.306 --> 12:58.675
Captain, are you aware
of how your ship is regarded?

12:58.744 --> 13:02.180
That when Voyager appears,
people fear destruction?

13:02.248 --> 13:05.217
Your ship is known
as a ship of death.

13:06.218 --> 13:08.186
What?

13:08.254 --> 13:10.279
You've established
quite a reputation.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.119
You killed the Caretaker,

13:12.191 --> 13:14.921
declared war on the Kazon,
raided planets

13:14.994 --> 13:16.621
for their resources.

13:16.695 --> 13:18.287
None of that is true.

13:18.364 --> 13:20.889
We've never attacked anyone
except in self-defense.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.934
And we did not
kill the Caretaker.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.696
He died of natural causes.

13:24.770 --> 13:27.671
Mr. Tanis, please
try to understand,

13:27.740 --> 13:29.674
we only want to find the entity
we've been looking for.

13:29.742 --> 13:32.210
I want to taIk to you aIone.

13:32.278 --> 13:35.805
Our sensors tell us she's
somewhere in this region.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.247
Can you help us find her?

13:38.317 --> 13:41.013
Captain, l'd like to speak
to Tanis alone, if l may.

13:43.389 --> 13:45.380
Very well.

13:51.463 --> 13:53.590
Why should l believe
any of this?

13:53.666 --> 13:56.134
These are kind people, Tanis.

13:56.202 --> 13:59.171
They saved my life,
at great risk to themselves,

13:59.238 --> 14:01.604
when they didn't have to.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.698
They wouldn't lie to you.

14:06.645 --> 14:11.105
l will admit, these people
are hardly what l expected.

14:11.183 --> 14:15.620
But more unexpected
was finding you here, Kes.

14:15.688 --> 14:20.318
l had no idea any Ocampa had
left the homeworld so recently.

14:20.392 --> 14:23.088
l have about a thousand
questions to ask you.

14:23.162 --> 14:27.360
l know, and l'm going
to try to answer them.

14:27.433 --> 14:29.697
ls this where you
spend your time?

14:29.768 --> 14:31.395
You mean in this room?

14:31.470 --> 14:32.732
No.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.239
This is where the Bridge
officers usually meet.

14:35.307 --> 14:37.798
l want to see where you live.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.313
l want to see the place
that is special to you.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.507
You did all this?

14:44.583 --> 14:47.814
l had a little help,
but, yes, most of it is my work.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.411
Well, you've done well--

14:49.488 --> 14:52.980
bringing something so beautiful
into a place so sterile.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.650
Sterile.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.989
Voyager?.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.120
Look around you, Kes.

14:58.197 --> 15:00.563
This is a cold and barren place.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.067
There are
over 150 people on board.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.126
l'd hardly call that barren.

15:05.204 --> 15:09.106
There are people,
but there's so little life.

15:09.174 --> 15:12.439
Part of me weeps
to see you in this place.

15:12.511 --> 15:14.445
You're so isolated.

15:14.513 --> 15:16.447
Corridors, bulkheads...

15:16.515 --> 15:19.450
all cutting you off
from the world around you.

15:19.518 --> 15:21.452
You live on a space station.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.181
How is it any different?

15:23.255 --> 15:25.655
l assure you,
it's very different.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.187
You're very young, aren't you?

15:29.261 --> 15:30.922
Two years.

15:30.996 --> 15:35.194
Would it surprise you
to know that l'm 14 years old?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.132
That's not possible.

15:37.202 --> 15:40.194
The oldest Ocampa
only lived to be nine.

15:40.272 --> 15:43.173
You know so little
about your own people.

15:43.242 --> 15:46.177
There's so much for you
to learn about yourself...

15:46.245 --> 15:48.179
about the galaxy.

15:48.247 --> 15:51.683
Being here on this ship
is holding you back.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.184
These people are helping me.

15:54.253 --> 15:56.483
l'm a member of the crew.

15:57.489 --> 15:59.787
l suppose
we were like you once--

15:59.858 --> 16:02.725
innocent, naive.

16:02.828 --> 16:05.422
But when Suspiria
brought us here 300 years ago,

16:05.464 --> 16:08.058
she began to teach us
how we could become stronger

16:08.133 --> 16:10.431
than we ever could've
on the homeworld.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.130
Suspiria... is that
your Caretaker?

16:13.205 --> 16:15.867
We don't think of her
as a Caretaker.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.466
Her species is actually
called the Nacene.

16:18.544 --> 16:20.171
Then you do know her.

16:20.245 --> 16:21.542
Where is she?

16:21.613 --> 16:23.911
Nearby.

16:23.983 --> 16:26.918
But she's so different
from the entity you knew.

16:26.986 --> 16:31.616
He was only interested
in maintaining the status quo.

16:31.690 --> 16:35.126
He kept our people
servile and weak.

16:35.194 --> 16:39.790
Suspiria taught us to develop
our psychokinetic skills

16:39.865 --> 16:42.800
that had lain dormant
for so long.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.804
We have abilities far beyond
anything you can imagine.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.642
Like what?

16:57.349 --> 16:59.909
We can enhance Iife.

16:59.985 --> 17:01.976
And that's onIy
the beginning, Kes.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.613
I have to return
to the station.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.809
We'II taIk again.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.827
Sounds like you've established
a dialogue with Tanis.

17:49.902 --> 17:51.392
lt's an excellent beginning.

17:51.470 --> 17:52.937
Good work.

17:53.038 --> 17:54.665
Thank you, Captain.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.071
Kes...

17:58.210 --> 18:00.110
is there something wrong?

18:00.179 --> 18:02.545
Not exactly.

18:02.614 --> 18:06.050
l'm just a little overwhelmed.

18:06.118 --> 18:09.053
l always believed that
my people had the potential

18:09.121 --> 18:11.385
to be more than what they were--

18:11.457 --> 18:14.051
that our mental abilities
could be somehow heightened--

18:14.126 --> 18:17.061
and now l've met someone
who's realized that potential

18:17.129 --> 18:20.565
and l don't know whether
to be excited or frightened.

18:20.632 --> 18:23.123
A nonemotional response
would be more useful.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.397
But since you're not a Vulcan,

18:25.471 --> 18:28.065
l'd say a mixture
of the two emotions

18:28.140 --> 18:30.108
would be appropriate.

18:30.175 --> 18:33.576
lt's an exciting moment, Kes,
and l'm very happy for you.

18:33.645 --> 18:35.112
But just remember,

18:35.180 --> 18:37.239
we know very little
about these Ocampa.

18:37.316 --> 18:40.114
Be cautious in your dealings
with Tanis.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.915
l will.

18:42.988 --> 18:45.980
But l just have
a good feeling about him.

19:06.578 --> 19:09.206
I've met with the Ocampa girI.

19:09.281 --> 19:11.181
She has potentiaI.

19:11.250 --> 19:13.150
I don't care about the girI.

19:13.218 --> 19:14.685
She's yours.

19:14.753 --> 19:16.448
Bring me the ship.

19:23.195 --> 19:24.662
This is delicious!

19:24.730 --> 19:29.667
Mr. Tanis, is it true
you're 14 years old?

19:29.735 --> 19:33.694
Yes. That's quite common
with my people here.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.797
Suspiria helped us
develop a technology

19:35.874 --> 19:40.072
to extend the Ocampa life span
three generations ago.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.670
My father lived to be 20 years.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.740
Would that technology
work for Kes?

19:45.817 --> 19:47.444
Possibly.

19:47.519 --> 19:49.487
Where does Suspiria live?

19:49.555 --> 19:51.147
On another Array?

19:51.223 --> 19:53.487
Oh, nothing
so corporeal as that.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.925
She exists as pure
sporocystian energy.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.757
She only assumes physical form

19:57.829 --> 20:00.354
when we need
to communicate with her.

20:00.432 --> 20:02.662
Does she occupy
our space-time continuum?

20:02.734 --> 20:04.167
l don't know.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.932
All l know is, when we
need her, she comes.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.269
l'll take you
to the meeting place.

20:09.341 --> 20:12.606
l'm sure all your questions
will be answered then.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.612
You'll enjoy meeting her, Kes,

20:14.680 --> 20:16.705
as well
as the other Ocampa here.

20:16.782 --> 20:19.546
l'd love to visit the station.

20:19.618 --> 20:21.142
Visit? Why not stay with us?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.450
Stay?

20:24.523 --> 20:25.990
Yes. l think you could

20:26.091 --> 20:28.685
learn a lot from us,
we from you.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.923
We haven't been in contact
with the Ocampa homeworld

20:31.997 --> 20:33.624
for hundreds of years.

20:33.699 --> 20:35.894
We'd be fascinated to hear
about our distant cousins.

20:35.968 --> 20:38.368
That sounds wonderful,
but, uh...

20:38.437 --> 20:41.634
Kes, you certainly
don't have to decide

20:41.707 --> 20:44.005
something this important
right now.

20:44.076 --> 20:45.703
Give it some thought.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.611
She's absolutely right.
There's no rush.

20:50.682 --> 20:53.242
l appreciate that.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.309
l am curious
about your mental abilities.

20:55.387 --> 20:57.150
They're so much greater
than mine.

20:57.222 --> 20:59.986
Do not underestimate
your own potential, Kes.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.458
Your mental abilities
are rapidly maturing.

21:02.527 --> 21:05.291
l might be able to help you.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.491
No offense to Mr. Tuvok,

21:07.566 --> 21:10.933
but l am more familiar
with the Ocampa mind.

21:11.003 --> 21:13.699
l would appreciate any insight
you could give me.

21:13.772 --> 21:16.605
Oh, good.
Maybe later this evening.

21:20.912 --> 21:23.312
lt is a highly reactive
sporocystian toxin.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.942
l ran a micro-cellular
analysis

21:26.018 --> 21:29.146
of the Caretaker's remains,
and discovered a critical enzyme

21:29.221 --> 21:30.483
in his cellular structure.

21:30.555 --> 21:31.487
The energy in this cylinder

21:31.556 --> 21:33.615
is formulated to break
down that enzyme.

21:33.692 --> 21:35.819
lt would result
in temporary paralysis.

21:35.894 --> 21:37.885
Mr. Tanis says she's harmless.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.431
lt is my hope
that we only have to use it

21:40.499 --> 21:41.989
as a precautionary measure.

21:42.067 --> 21:44.729
Very well. Proceed.

21:49.141 --> 21:52.406
ln your mind,
visualize your hand.

21:52.477 --> 21:54.445
Now reach out with that hand

21:54.513 --> 21:56.037
and grab the teacup.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.879
Reach out
with the fingers of your mind.

21:59.951 --> 22:01.179
Grasp it.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.924
Do you have it?

22:07.025 --> 22:08.925
l can feel the handle

22:08.994 --> 22:12.054
and the texture of the metal,
but l can't move it.

22:12.130 --> 22:13.893
Don't try to move it.

22:13.965 --> 22:15.933
Just take a drink from it.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.168
See?

22:27.245 --> 22:28.473
You can do it.

22:28.547 --> 22:30.742
l don't understand.
l didn't try to move it.

22:30.816 --> 22:33.478
No. You just tried to drink
from it.

22:33.552 --> 22:36.885
And what would you do
if you wanted to take a drink?

22:36.955 --> 22:38.479
l'd reach out and pick it up.

22:38.557 --> 22:39.819
That's right.

22:39.891 --> 22:42.155
But you wouldn't be thinking
about picking it up.

22:42.227 --> 22:43.558
You'd simply do it.

22:43.628 --> 22:46.358
And that's
what you just learned.

22:46.431 --> 22:49.366
Focus on the goal, not the task.

22:49.434 --> 22:52.528
When you wanted the tea,
it came to you.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.435
Uh, excuse me...

22:54.506 --> 22:57.031
We're not finished.

22:58.643 --> 22:59.940
l know you're tired,

23:00.011 --> 23:02.275
but l want you to try
one more thing.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.077
lt's cold.

23:06.151 --> 23:09.484
Wouldn't it taste better
if it were hot?

23:15.293 --> 23:17.124
See past the liquid.

23:17.195 --> 23:18.822
Not with your eyes,
with your mind.

23:18.897 --> 23:23.231
What your eyes show you
is only the surface of reality.

23:23.301 --> 23:25.166
Look deeper.

23:27.305 --> 23:28.932
There is no liquid.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.701
There is no cup.

23:30.776 --> 23:34.542
There's only a collection
of molecules and atoms,

23:34.613 --> 23:37.480
moving, vibrating...

23:43.889 --> 23:45.356
I see them.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.948
They're bareIy moving.

23:47.025 --> 23:49.323
That's because they're coId.

23:49.394 --> 23:51.259
How wouId you heat them up?

23:51.329 --> 23:53.763
With... a fire.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.299
That's right--

23:55.367 --> 23:57.301
with the fire of your mind.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.303
How do I do that?

23:59.371 --> 24:02.499
Focus on the goaI,
not the task.

24:02.607 --> 24:06.668
Don't think about creating
the fire, just use it.

24:30.936 --> 24:32.369
l see it now.

24:32.437 --> 24:33.802
lt's so simple.

24:33.872 --> 24:36.102
That's right.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.142
But that's enough for tonight.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.974
Tomorrow, l'll take you
to the next level.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.412
Until then, good night.

24:51.122 --> 24:53.147
May l say something now?

24:53.225 --> 24:55.318
Of course, Neelix.

24:58.230 --> 25:00.698
l'm so proud of you.

25:00.765 --> 25:04.030
l knew you could do it.

25:04.102 --> 25:07.071
This is a whole new
beginning for you, Kes.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.663
l know, l know.

25:09.741 --> 25:11.368
What if l did go?

25:12.444 --> 25:14.002
Go?

25:14.079 --> 25:15.569
To the Ocampa Array.

25:15.647 --> 25:19.242
lf l decided to live with Tanis
and the others...

25:19.317 --> 25:20.875
would you go with me?

25:23.088 --> 25:25.818
l'd go anywhere with you.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.894
Captain's Log, supplemental.

25:31.963 --> 25:35.592
We've arrived at what Tanis
calls ''the meeting place''--

25:35.667 --> 25:38.500
the region of space
where Suspiria exists.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.538
Nothing on sensors, Captain.

25:43.041 --> 25:46.533
Captain, may l access
your communications equipment?

25:46.611 --> 25:48.010
Of course.

25:59.624 --> 26:01.956
l've sent out
a subspace carrier wave.

26:02.060 --> 26:04.893
Suspiria should respond
within the next 47 hours.

26:04.930 --> 26:06.363
l'll be in my quarters.

26:06.431 --> 26:08.524
We'll let you know when
she makes her appearance.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.158
That won't be necessary.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.896
l'll know when she's here.

26:23.014 --> 26:25.539
Tanis has shown me
the next level.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.085
The psychokinetic
manipulation of matter.

26:28.153 --> 26:30.553
That is a large step
for someone

26:30.622 --> 26:33.216
whose mental abilities
are still undisciplined.

26:33.291 --> 26:35.816
Nevertheless, l am intrigued.

26:35.894 --> 26:37.054
May l?

26:37.128 --> 26:38.186
Please.

26:45.837 --> 26:49.864
He showed me how to use
the fire in my mind.

27:02.420 --> 27:03.944
Fascinating.

27:04.022 --> 27:07.287
However, l would advise caution
in exploring this ability

27:07.359 --> 27:08.986
until you have mastered the...

27:16.568 --> 27:18.399
I have to stop the fire.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.062
How do I stop the fire?!

27:20.138 --> 27:23.403
Tuvok... Tuvok,
can you teII me what to do?!

27:23.475 --> 27:24.908
Tuvok!

27:28.013 --> 27:30.243
No!

27:44.129 --> 27:47.030
Lieutenant, can you hear me?

27:56.041 --> 27:57.838
What happened?

27:57.909 --> 27:58.933
Your cell membranes

27:59.044 --> 28:01.012
went through
hyperthermal induction.

28:01.112 --> 28:02.773
The temperature of your blood

28:02.814 --> 28:05.476
rose by 37 degrees
in a matter of seconds.

28:05.550 --> 28:08.451
You were in shock,
and l resuscitated you.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.454
l'm restricting you
to light duty

28:10.522 --> 28:11.955
for the next three days.

28:12.023 --> 28:13.581
Try and get some rest.

28:14.592 --> 28:16.856
That will not be necessary,
Doctor.

28:16.928 --> 28:19.192
My Vulcan healing techniques
do not require

28:19.264 --> 28:21.596
an extended period
of convalescence.

28:23.068 --> 28:25.593
Vulcans make the worst patients.

28:27.605 --> 28:31.473
Fine, but if you're feeling
any nausea or dizziness,

28:31.543 --> 28:33.477
l'm expecting you
to report to Sick Bay at once.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.944
Of course.

28:36.881 --> 28:37.848
Tuvok, l'm sor...

28:37.916 --> 28:39.645
You are probably
feeling the emotion

28:39.718 --> 28:42.186
known as remorse,
possibly guilt.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.244
l advise you to look
on this incident

28:44.322 --> 28:45.721
as a learning experience.

28:45.790 --> 28:47.155
lt's not that easy.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.658
l almost killed you.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.287
That is correct,
but you did not.

28:51.362 --> 28:53.227
Try to remember that.

28:53.298 --> 28:56.233
l will see you tomorrow
at 1500 hours,

28:56.301 --> 28:59.065
assuming you wish to continue
your training.

28:59.137 --> 29:01.037
You still want to teach me?

29:01.139 --> 29:03.232
lf this experience
proves anything,

29:03.274 --> 29:06.243
it is that you need
further instruction,

29:06.311 --> 29:07.938
and l would regret

29:08.012 --> 29:10.572
not continuing
as your instructor.

29:10.648 --> 29:12.775
Thanks, Tuvok.

29:31.402 --> 29:33.529
How's the Vulcan?

29:33.605 --> 29:35.664
ls he going to recover?

29:35.740 --> 29:37.071
You heard?

29:37.142 --> 29:38.871
ln a manner of speaking.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.968
l was aware of what happened.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.741
He's going to be all right,
no thanks to me.

29:43.815 --> 29:46.545
Tanis, l've been thinking--

29:46.618 --> 29:48.483
l don't know
if l'm ready for this.

29:48.553 --> 29:49.645
What's wrong?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.655
lf l can't control my abilities,

29:51.723 --> 29:53.657
there might be another accident.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.819
l'm afraid it isn't going
to get any easier, Kes.

29:56.895 --> 29:59.455
You're already starting
to manifest abilities

29:59.531 --> 30:01.863
far beyond anything
you've ever imagined.

30:01.933 --> 30:03.628
Soon you'll be so far

30:03.701 --> 30:05.635
beyond the other beings
on this ship

30:05.703 --> 30:08.228
that you'll look at them
as they look at... pets.

30:08.306 --> 30:09.773
They're not pets.

30:09.841 --> 30:10.773
They're people.

30:10.842 --> 30:11.934
They're my friends.

30:12.010 --> 30:14.774
And l'm sure you care
for them very much.

30:14.846 --> 30:17.110
l'm sure
they're wonderful people,

30:17.182 --> 30:19.980
and they certainly seem
that way to me, but...

30:20.084 --> 30:22.882
it's time that you began
to accept how different

30:22.954 --> 30:24.581
you are from them.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.487
The people on this ship--
they live their lives

30:26.558 --> 30:28.890
trapped inside
their primitive skulls,

30:28.960 --> 30:30.951
depending on flesh and bone

30:31.029 --> 30:33.554
to tell them
what the universe is like.

30:33.631 --> 30:37.192
They don't know what it is
to see beyond the physical.

30:37.268 --> 30:39.236
Touch it.

30:40.939 --> 30:43.499
This is how they
know their universe.

30:43.575 --> 30:46.009
They touch the flower,
their nerve impulses

30:46.077 --> 30:48.375
travel up their arm
to the brain,

30:48.446 --> 30:52.212
and in their mind, they sense
the moisture of the petals,

30:52.283 --> 30:55.480
the texture of the leaves,
the sharpness of the thorns,

30:55.553 --> 30:58.044
and they think they know
what it feels like,

30:58.122 --> 31:00.147
but they don't.

31:00.225 --> 31:02.318
Now touch it.

31:02.393 --> 31:04.691
Reach out with your thoughts.

31:04.762 --> 31:08.254
Feel it for the very first time.

31:10.702 --> 31:15.105
Think of nothing but the flower.

31:15.173 --> 31:16.936
lt's the only object
in the universe.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.303
Know it.

31:18.376 --> 31:23.040
Know it in a way
only an Ocampa can.

31:25.550 --> 31:26.881
Can you see it?

31:26.951 --> 31:28.316
Yes.

31:28.386 --> 31:31.116
lt's more than seeing.

31:31.189 --> 31:33.453
lt's more than touching.

31:33.524 --> 31:36.652
l know this flower.

31:36.728 --> 31:37.820
You can do more.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.887
Reach out.

31:39.964 --> 31:43.456
Feel all the life in this room.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.552
Yes, l can feel it.

32:04.622 --> 32:06.283
l know them all.

32:06.357 --> 32:08.348
They're so beautiful.

32:08.426 --> 32:10.553
lt can be more beautiful.

32:10.628 --> 32:12.926
Bring the fire.

32:47.532 --> 32:49.329
How did it feel?

32:54.105 --> 32:55.868
They're dead.

32:58.943 --> 33:01.343
They're all dead.

33:01.446 --> 33:03.573
Amazing.

33:03.614 --> 33:05.548
You felt life.

33:05.616 --> 33:09.245
You embraced its essence
with your mind

33:09.320 --> 33:11.220
and then you transformed it.

33:11.289 --> 33:14.452
There's nothing else
like it in the universe.

33:14.525 --> 33:16.322
l killed those plants...

33:16.394 --> 33:19.830
just like l almost killed Tuvok.

33:19.897 --> 33:21.922
But l don't want
to hurt anybody.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.093
Of course you don't.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.931
That's not the point.

33:26.004 --> 33:29.804
Hurt people, help them,
give life, kill--

33:29.874 --> 33:31.501
it's all the same.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.703
Once you see
beyond the physical,

33:33.778 --> 33:37.646
you see the universe
as it truly is.

33:37.715 --> 33:41.481
Now you know why you can't stay
with these people--

33:41.552 --> 33:43.986
why you have to come with me.

33:45.323 --> 33:47.291
Come back to the station.

33:47.358 --> 33:49.622
We'll care for you.

33:49.694 --> 33:51.252
We'll train you.

33:53.131 --> 33:55.395
Oh, l don't know.

34:01.606 --> 34:04.074
l still need some more time
to think about it.

34:04.142 --> 34:07.236
Take all the time you want.

34:07.311 --> 34:09.279
But when you meet Suspiria,

34:09.347 --> 34:10.507
l think you'll decide
to join us.

34:10.581 --> 34:12.446
Why?

34:12.516 --> 34:15.110
Because Suspiria is your future.

34:15.186 --> 34:18.587
She's part of us,
and we're a part of her.

34:18.656 --> 34:22.217
All the Ocampa here
are connected in a way

34:22.293 --> 34:26.252
that can't be put into
words, and if you develop

34:26.330 --> 34:28.560
your abilities far enough,

34:28.632 --> 34:32.967
Suspiria will invite you
to go with her to Exosia.

34:34.539 --> 34:35.597
Exosia?

34:35.672 --> 34:38.369
A place the humanoids
on this ship call

34:38.443 --> 34:41.206
''a subspace layer,''
a place of pure thought,

34:41.279 --> 34:45.545
pure energy,
a place of the mind.

34:45.616 --> 34:47.413
Think about it, Kes.

34:47.485 --> 34:50.886
When you're ready,
Suspiria will embrace you.

34:50.955 --> 34:52.922
Good night.

35:18.816 --> 35:19.908
Torres to Bridge.

35:19.984 --> 35:21.975
The Caretaker's remains
are resonating again.

35:25.189 --> 35:27.555
lt's definitely reacting
to a sporocystian life-form,

35:27.625 --> 35:28.557
and from what l can tell,

35:28.626 --> 35:30.526
that life-form
is right on top of us.

35:30.595 --> 35:31.619
Acknowledged.

35:31.696 --> 35:32.822
Captain...

35:32.897 --> 35:35.559
there's a subspace rupture
forming directly ahead.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.565
Yellow Alert.

35:36.634 --> 35:37.566
Janeway to Tanis.

35:37.635 --> 35:38.863
Will you please
come to the Bridge?

35:38.936 --> 35:41.200
l believe we've made contact
with Suspiria.

35:41.272 --> 35:42.739
l know. l'm on my way.

35:44.609 --> 35:46.804
l think we should run
a biospectral analysis.

35:46.878 --> 35:49.312
Some of these readings
are pretty strange.

35:49.380 --> 35:52.315
And get me the sensor logs on
that subspace rupture out there.

35:54.585 --> 35:57.816
Captain, l'm picking up some
strange readings in Engineering.

35:57.889 --> 36:00.323
Some kind of plasmatic
energy field is forming.

36:00.424 --> 36:01.584
Janeway to Torres.

36:01.626 --> 36:03.457
We're picking up some odd
plasmatic readings down there.

36:03.528 --> 36:05.519
Can you confirm?

36:05.596 --> 36:06.995
Janeway to Torres.

36:08.399 --> 36:09.957
Security, meet me
in Main Engineering.

36:10.034 --> 36:11.023
Aye, sir.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.591
lt's time to go.

36:37.662 --> 36:39.357
Go... where?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.660
Back to the Ocampa station.

36:41.732 --> 36:43.927
Everyone's waiting for you, Kes.

36:44.035 --> 36:45.263
The connection has been made.

36:45.336 --> 36:47.270
You're part of us now.

36:47.338 --> 36:49.898
Your future has already begun.

37:06.123 --> 37:07.750
Tuvok to Bridge.

37:07.825 --> 37:09.156
Go ahead.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.491
l believe the female Caretaker
is here.

37:11.562 --> 37:14.190
Commander, you have the Bridge.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.295
Can't you feel the connection?

37:21.372 --> 37:24.102
Your people are calling to you.

37:24.175 --> 37:26.006
Listen to them.

37:28.846 --> 37:30.507
Yes.

37:32.116 --> 37:34.311
l can hear them.

37:34.385 --> 37:36.250
All of them.

37:36.320 --> 37:38.311
And can you hear Suspiria?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.031
Tuvok?

38:08.552 --> 38:09.917
Who are you?

38:12.323 --> 38:14.416
Suspiria.

38:17.561 --> 38:20.962
l've been looking forward
to meeting you.

38:21.032 --> 38:22.761
Why?

38:22.833 --> 38:26.098
Because l had the opportunity
to talk to your companion

38:26.170 --> 38:28.001
before he died.

38:28.072 --> 38:30.438
Yes, l know.

38:30.508 --> 38:32.533
l can feel her presence.

38:32.610 --> 38:34.669
She's powerful...

38:34.745 --> 38:36.736
turbulent.

38:41.385 --> 38:44.149
She's upset.

38:44.221 --> 38:45.916
She's angry!

38:45.990 --> 38:47.958
Kes...

38:51.228 --> 38:53.822
She wants to destroy the ship!

38:53.898 --> 38:55.695
Kes, listen to me.

38:55.766 --> 38:56.755
There's nothing to worry about.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.768
Am l interrupting?

38:59.904 --> 39:02.202
He told us that you were curious

39:02.306 --> 39:04.570
and went off to explore
the galaxy.

39:04.608 --> 39:06.701
We're explorers, too,

39:06.777 --> 39:10.372
but your friend brought us to
this Quadrant against our will,

39:10.448 --> 39:12.712
and we haven't been able
to find a way back.

39:12.783 --> 39:14.978
ls that why you killed him?

39:15.052 --> 39:17.020
We didn't kill him.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.022
You destroyed the Array

39:19.090 --> 39:20.580
and you took his remains.

39:20.658 --> 39:22.216
-l assure you...
-No!

39:22.293 --> 39:25.285
You killed him.

39:25.363 --> 39:29.094
And now, l will kill you.

39:51.088 --> 39:55.787
Now you will know what frail,
small creatures you truly are.

40:06.637 --> 40:07.934
What's going on?

40:08.005 --> 40:09.597
l don't know.

40:09.673 --> 40:12.107
lt's like the entire molecular
structure of the ship

40:12.176 --> 40:13.734
is coming apart.

40:13.811 --> 40:15.369
Red Alert.

40:15.446 --> 40:16.435
Bridge to Janeway.

40:17.615 --> 40:19.082
Bridge to Janeway.

40:20.785 --> 40:22.514
We're losing hull integrity.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.520
lncrease power
to structural reinforcement.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.112
Aye, sir.

40:26.190 --> 40:28.317
Forget these people.
You're beyond them.

40:28.392 --> 40:29.654
No.

40:29.727 --> 40:31.558
Leave her alone, Tanis.

40:31.629 --> 40:34.564
Remember how you felt
in the airponics bay?

40:34.632 --> 40:37.999
You've never felt that way
in your entire life, have you?

40:38.102 --> 40:39.535
Get away from me.

40:39.603 --> 40:41.537
That was only the beginning,
Kes.

40:41.605 --> 40:43.129
l said leave her alone!

40:45.543 --> 40:46.532
Neelix!

40:46.610 --> 40:48.840
Leave him!
Leave him, Kes!

40:48.913 --> 40:51.279
He's nothing compared to you.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.508
Nothing!

40:52.583 --> 40:54.574
You have to trust.

41:18.576 --> 41:19.838
Oh, Neelix.

41:19.910 --> 41:21.605
Suspiria...

41:54.578 --> 41:57.945
So, now you kill me
as you did my mate.

41:58.015 --> 42:01.246
No. l told you
we didn't kill him.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.151
Please try to understand.

42:05.222 --> 42:07.156
We don't want to hurt you.

42:07.224 --> 42:09.158
We don't want to hurt anyone.

42:09.226 --> 42:12.093
We just want to get home.

42:19.303 --> 42:22.636
Tuvok, release the force field.

42:22.706 --> 42:24.469
Captain...

42:24.542 --> 42:25.873
Do it.

42:37.087 --> 42:40.716
You'd show me mercy
after what l did to you?

42:41.825 --> 42:45.124
Yes, l would.

43:05.883 --> 43:09.478
Take me with you... please.

43:14.959 --> 43:16.927
lt appears she has descended
into subspace.

43:17.027 --> 43:18.153
Can you track her position?

43:18.228 --> 43:19.160
Negative.

43:19.229 --> 43:20.526
The rupture has been sealed.

43:23.567 --> 43:25.228
She is gone, Captain.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.775
Captain's Log, supplemental.

43:33.844 --> 43:36.438
We've resumed our course
back to the Alpha Quadrant,

43:36.513 --> 43:39.141
but the female Caretaker
is still out there

43:39.216 --> 43:41.309
with the power to send us home.

43:41.385 --> 43:43.615
And l will use all my power
to find her

43:43.687 --> 43:46.349
and convince her
to do just that.

43:49.426 --> 43:50.757
l looked at the tea

43:50.828 --> 43:53.092
and l tried to make it boil,
but nothing happened.

43:53.163 --> 43:55.825
Without Tanis' help,
l just can't do it.

43:55.899 --> 43:57.161
Nevertheless,

43:57.234 --> 43:59.998
your psychokinetic abilities
are still part of you.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.766
They might resurface one day.

44:01.805 --> 44:05.036
To be honest, l never want to
see that part of myself again.

44:05.109 --> 44:07.077
To which part are you referring?

44:07.144 --> 44:08.406
To the part of me

44:08.479 --> 44:10.140
that got pleasure
from destroying those plants

44:10.214 --> 44:11.545
in the airponics bay.

44:11.615 --> 44:14.277
To the part of me that was
tempted to go with Tanis.

44:14.351 --> 44:17.479
l never realized l had
such dark impulses.

44:17.554 --> 44:19.021
Without the darkness,

44:19.089 --> 44:21.023
how would we recognize
the light?

44:21.091 --> 44:23.582
Do not fear
your negative thoughts.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.151
They are part of you.

44:25.229 --> 44:27.663
They are a part
of every living being.

44:27.731 --> 44:28.857
Even Vulcans.

44:28.932 --> 44:30.092
You?

44:30.167 --> 44:34.160
The Vulcan heart was forged
out of barbarism and violence.

44:34.238 --> 44:36.172
We learned to control it.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.708
But it is still part of us.

44:38.776 --> 44:40.710
To pretend it does not exist

44:40.778 --> 44:43.838
is to create an opportunity
for it to escape.

44:43.914 --> 44:45.575
Let us begin.

44:55.325 --> 44:56.952
Open yourself

44:57.027 --> 44:59.427
to the impressions around you--

44:59.496 --> 45:03.990
the thoughts, the minds
that are on this ship.
