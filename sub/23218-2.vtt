What's your emergency?

00:03.404 --> 00:05.806
-Help me get her some air.
-Why don't I just punch it
in its face?

00:23.757 --> 00:24.992
DEVON:
Did you hear that?

00:25.025 --> 00:28.062
-Those were not screams of joy.
-I know.

00:28.096 --> 00:30.098
People are flipping out.
Isn't it great?

00:30.131 --> 00:32.700
I-I don't need to experience
the kind of bowel-clenching fear

00:32.733 --> 00:34.668
that causes people
to scream like that.

00:34.702 --> 00:37.004
By the way, bowel clenching
is another thing I'm afraid of.

00:37.037 --> 00:40.108
Good. You can cross two fears
off your list with one ride.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.245
I don't want to do this.

00:44.278 --> 00:46.247
All right, check it out.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.249
There are two hot girls
in front of us.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.384
If we get out of this line,

00:50.418 --> 00:53.887
they will Facebook, Twitter,
and Instagram our faces

00:53.921 --> 00:55.689
with #pussies.

00:55.723 --> 00:59.460
I don't want to be a #pussy.
Do you?

00:59.493 --> 01:01.195
So you'd rather
have me crap my pants

01:01.229 --> 01:04.432
than be humiliated in front
of two complete strangers?

01:04.465 --> 01:05.433
Absolutely.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.901
Plus, they're hot.

01:07.935 --> 01:11.872
So that's potentially
thousands of strangers.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.874
("Mess Around" by
Cage the Elephant plays)

01:13.907 --> 01:15.643
* Oh, no

01:16.644 --> 01:18.646
* Oh, no

01:20.314 --> 01:22.316
* Oh, no

01:23.317 --> 01:26.086
* Oh, no

01:27.455 --> 01:29.823
* Ah

01:29.857 --> 01:30.891
* Oh, no

01:30.924 --> 01:32.260
* Ah...

01:32.293 --> 01:33.294
Enjoy the ride.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.328
Crap.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.764
* Ah...

01:38.966 --> 01:41.302
You're clenching your
butt cheeks, aren't you?

01:41.335 --> 01:42.936
I hate you.

01:44.538 --> 01:46.607
Oh, my God.

01:46.640 --> 01:48.108
Whoa, here we go!

01:53.447 --> 01:54.448
Chad!

02:01.021 --> 02:02.990
He's not moving.
Send an ambulance.

02:03.023 --> 02:05.259
DEVON:
Please, hurry!

02:05.293 --> 02:07.161
Buck, we came in
at the wrong angle.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.797
I'm gonna have you climb
up there, harness him in,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.098
and hang tight
while we move the truck.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.132
You think you can handle that?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.133
Hell yeah.

02:13.167 --> 02:14.202
This daredevil hero stuff

02:14.235 --> 02:15.669
is what I signed up for, Bobby.

02:15.703 --> 02:17.805
-Good.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.840
Help us! Please!

02:19.873 --> 02:22.343
Everybody, try to stay calm.

02:22.376 --> 02:24.212
We'll get you down,
I promise, all right?

02:24.245 --> 02:26.214
I need you to relax,
I need you to breathe,

02:26.247 --> 02:29.116
and I need you to keep
as still as possible.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.552
You move less, you stay safe.

02:31.585 --> 02:33.754
We get everyone
off this ride safe.

02:36.690 --> 02:38.292
Hey, what's your name, man?

02:38.326 --> 02:40.528
:
Devon.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.896
Devon. All right, Devon.
Well, hang on, brother.

02:42.930 --> 02:45.299
:
Where's Chad?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.867
What happened to Chad?

02:46.900 --> 02:50.304
Hey, Bobby, he's asking
about his friend.

02:50.338 --> 02:53.374
BOBBY:
Chimney, it's Captain, you copy?

02:53.407 --> 02:54.708
Copy, Captain. What do you need?

02:54.742 --> 02:55.976
How's the kid on the ground?

02:56.009 --> 02:57.578
He's gone.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.213
We lost him.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.515
All right, I don't need
the people up there seeing that.

03:01.549 --> 03:03.183
So, do me a favor...

03:03.217 --> 03:04.818
He survived, right?

03:04.852 --> 03:06.887
Get him on a gurney.
You know the drill.

03:06.920 --> 03:07.955
Copy that.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.200
BUCK: Hang in there, guys.
We're coming.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.902
I'm almost there.

03:21.935 --> 03:23.571
What happened to Chad?!

03:23.604 --> 03:25.172
He's dead, isn't he?

03:25.205 --> 03:26.507
Hey, Devon, look at me.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.909
Chad... He's getting help.
You see?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.378
He's gonna be fine.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.912
And I'm not gonna let anything

03:31.945 --> 03:33.213
happen to you, all right?

03:34.715 --> 03:37.785
-No, we're not okay!

03:37.818 --> 03:39.687
Why is the fire truck
going away?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.222
It's just getting into a better
position, that's all.

03:42.256 --> 03:44.392
Devon, how we doing?

03:44.425 --> 03:47.595
It's gonna be everywhere.

03:47.628 --> 03:50.864
-It's gonna be
all over the place. -Hey.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.233
Forget about them, okay?
You don't look down.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.368
You look up at me.

03:54.402 --> 03:56.236
You see this strap here?

03:56.270 --> 03:58.439
All you got to do
is reach up your arm,

03:58.472 --> 04:00.608
-slide it through the loop.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.276
I can't!

04:02.310 --> 04:03.577
-Yes, you...
-I can't!

04:03.611 --> 04:04.712
Yes, you can, buddy.
You can do it.

04:04.745 --> 04:05.979
Come on, Buck. Come on, Buck.

04:08.081 --> 04:10.318
Can you tell them
to stop recording, please?

04:10.351 --> 04:12.620
I don't want everyone
to see me like this.

04:12.653 --> 04:14.288
-Listen, Devon, I need you to
concentrate.

04:14.322 --> 04:17.325
Slide your arm
through the loop...

04:17.358 --> 04:20.227
and then we can deal
with everything else.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.896
All right.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.933
Hey. Reach up your hand.
Come on.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.902
It's, like, three inches.
You can do this. I got you.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.304
Devon.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.506
Devon, I need you to trust me.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.308
Give me your hand.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.677
I will not let you go.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.251
I can't.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.820
Devon. Devon, please.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.121
Hey, Devon!

04:48.889 --> 04:49.957
-Oh!

05:03.170 --> 05:04.271
I'm not hungry.

05:04.304 --> 05:05.639
This is America, Buckaroo.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.207
Eating has nothing to do
with being hungry.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.942
Man, I was right there.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.278
You know, all he had to do
was reach up and grab my hand.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.014
CHIMNEY: People do funny things
at times like that.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.483
Sometimes they just freeze up.

05:16.517 --> 05:19.387
I've never lost anyone before.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.655
-No.

05:21.689 --> 05:24.392
Look, people die, and that's
part of the gig, right?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.527
See, your problem is,
you're looking at every job

05:26.560 --> 05:28.028
like it's
a long-term relationship.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.230
They're one-night stands, man.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.332
In that moment,
they mean everything to you,

05:32.366 --> 05:35.536
but once the morning comes...
it's on to the next one.

05:35.569 --> 05:37.337
HEN:
Hey.

05:37.371 --> 05:38.506
You guys don't mind, I brought

05:38.539 --> 05:41.308
some company to family dinner.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.177
Athena's going through some,
uh, some stuff at home,

05:44.211 --> 05:45.846
so she could use some TLC.

05:45.879 --> 05:48.582
BOBBY: Well, we don't
usually allow cops

05:48.616 --> 05:49.683
at secret firehouse meetings,

05:49.717 --> 05:51.585
but, uh, I'll make an exception.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.421
Mm. All right. Appreciate that.

05:55.956 --> 05:57.758
Oh. Well.

05:57.791 --> 06:01.228
You know, I ain't sold
on you yet, but...

06:01.261 --> 06:03.464
I think keeping me from getting
shot deserves a second chance.

06:08.135 --> 06:09.937
Hey, there won't be
a third, though.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.374
Buck here is having
a little trouble

06:14.408 --> 06:16.343
moving on from a call
that didn't go his way.

06:16.376 --> 06:20.213
Oh. You know why they make us
wear these uniforms, right?

06:20.247 --> 06:22.382
Cops, firefighters, paramedics?

06:22.416 --> 06:25.185
-Mm-hmm.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.588
So people can easily
identify us.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.724
Both true, but it's also
for our own good.

06:30.758 --> 06:34.027
Because when we take the uniform
off at the end of the day,

06:34.061 --> 06:36.029
it symbolizes letting go

06:36.063 --> 06:39.132
of all of the sad, crazy,
inhumane things

06:39.166 --> 06:41.068
we've seen that day.

06:41.101 --> 06:44.271
I see his face every time
I close my eyes.

06:44.304 --> 06:45.439
That happen to you guys?

06:48.408 --> 06:50.310
It'll pass.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.252
Game over.

07:00.854 --> 07:02.089
You coming, kid?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.636
NEWS ANCHOR: Terror and heroism
at the state fair.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.672
Passengers trapped
on a carnival ride gone haywire.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.273
Our own Marcy Henderson
got a few words

07:20.307 --> 07:22.676
with Evan "Buck" Buckley,
the hero firefighter

07:22.710 --> 07:26.013
who risked his life
climbing the broken ride.

07:26.046 --> 07:28.649
-BUCK: I reached out to
pull him out the car.

07:28.682 --> 07:32.252
He wouldn't give me his hand.
I don't know what happened.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.821
I-I don't know why
he would do that.

07:33.854 --> 07:34.855
NEWS ANCHOR:
He's responsible for saving

07:34.888 --> 07:36.423
four lives on the ride...

07:36.456 --> 07:38.158
-MOM: Help.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.660
-Abby, help me.

07:39.693 --> 07:42.696
What is it, Mom?

07:42.730 --> 07:44.932
What is it

07:44.965 --> 07:47.267
-MOM: Oh, I can't get out.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.936
-Yes, I guess, I guess...
-Oh, Mom...

07:48.969 --> 07:52.105
Did you lock the other one?

07:52.139 --> 07:53.874
Coming in.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.609
Mom, you cannot
lock these doors.

07:55.643 --> 07:57.545
I'm sorry, honey. I...

07:57.578 --> 07:59.513
Can you, can you unlock it?

07:59.547 --> 08:01.549
-No, I don't know how to.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.183
Well...

08:03.216 --> 08:05.686
It's too dangerous.
You cannot lock the door, Mom.

08:05.719 --> 08:07.220
And I'm late for work.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.958
Hi, I'm Carla
from In-Home Services.

08:10.991 --> 08:12.325
Is this the Clark residence?

08:12.359 --> 08:14.061
-Oh, my God. You're on time.
-Yes, yes.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.495
-Come in, come in, come in.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.198
Yeah. M-My mom locked herself
in the bathroom.

08:18.231 --> 08:20.033
Oh, you got to take
the locks off the doors,

08:20.067 --> 08:22.035
except the front one-- you got
to lock that from the outside.

08:22.069 --> 08:23.503
Well, I haven't exactly
had the chance

08:23.537 --> 08:25.505
-to Alzheimer-proof
the apartment. -Okay. It's okay.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.340
It's okay. My husband's
a handyman. We'll handle it.

08:27.374 --> 08:28.676
Let's get her out
of here first, okay?

08:28.709 --> 08:32.512
Ms. Clark? Hi, my name
is Carla Price.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.682
It's very nice to meet you.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.484
I need you to unlock
this door for me.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.852
MOM:
I can't. I don't know how.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.353
Okay, if you're on the floor,

08:40.387 --> 08:42.222
I need you to stand up
and walk to the door.

08:42.255 --> 08:43.657
-MOM: I'm up.
-Okay.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.025
Take your right hand

08:45.058 --> 08:46.660
and put it on the doorknob
and turn it.

08:46.694 --> 08:48.161
MOM:
Okay.

08:48.195 --> 08:49.997
If that doesn't work,
turn it the other way.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.404
-I'm okay. -Okay. All right,
let's get you...

08:57.437 --> 08:59.439
-Let's get you in your chair.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.241
It's okay.

09:01.274 --> 09:05.012
Hi, I'm Carla. I'll be right in
to give you a great foot rub.

09:05.045 --> 09:08.248
-Oh. Well, thank you.
-You're welcome, ma'am.

09:08.281 --> 09:09.717
-All right.
-Ma'am.

09:09.750 --> 09:13.086
Great.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.087
You go ahead.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.255
You go ahead. I'm fine.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.523
-Uh-huh.

09:16.556 --> 09:17.758
I know exactly where I'm going.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.029
Oh, my gosh.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.563
Oh.

09:23.597 --> 09:26.366
I've never had anybody
help me with her before.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.368
Hey, what you're being asked
to do is so hard.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.738
It's like one long
emergency, okay?

09:30.771 --> 09:33.106
But I'm here to help now.
This is what I do.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.241
Do you want to move in?

09:34.274 --> 09:35.242
-I'm serious.

09:35.275 --> 09:36.610
You can have my room.

09:36.644 --> 09:38.812
Bring your family, bring your
husband, whoever you got.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.547
I'm gonna like working here.

09:40.580 --> 09:42.816
But, look, go get your life back
for a little while. I got this.

Come on, come on.

09:46.787 --> 09:48.622
It's time to go.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.858
Hey, Mom and I need to go
to work, hustle up.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.662
Hey, little man,
you brush your teeth?

09:54.695 --> 09:56.129
Yeah. Smell.

09:57.497 --> 09:58.999
-Ooh!

10:00.200 --> 10:03.336
Hey, want a cup
of coffee to go, babe?

10:03.370 --> 10:05.238
No.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.907
Harry, where's your sister?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.010
She said she's sick.
She's in bed.

10:14.948 --> 10:17.751
Baby, when did you start
feeling sick

10:17.785 --> 10:18.786
This morning.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.622
Mm-hmm.

10:22.656 --> 10:25.859
You got a test or something
today that you're not ready for?

10:25.893 --> 10:27.360
I said I'm sick.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.199
Okay.

10:32.232 --> 10:34.702
Why don't you get Harry
to school, and, uh,

10:34.735 --> 10:37.470
I'll push my meetings
back to this afternoon.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.606
Get our little patient
set up here for today.

10:39.639 --> 10:40.607
You sure?

10:40.640 --> 10:42.409
Yeah.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.483
Thank you.

11:06.533 --> 11:08.702
DISPATCH:
Need all available units.

11:08.736 --> 11:10.670
Please report to 673 Leland Way.

11:10.704 --> 11:12.873
We have a canine attack
in progress.

11:12.906 --> 11:14.641
ATHENA:
Eight-L-Thirty handling.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.910
* No, I don't want
to give you mine and *

11:16.944 --> 11:19.646
* No, I don't want
to meet you nowhere *

11:19.679 --> 11:22.215
* No, I don't want none
of your time and *

11:22.249 --> 11:25.652
* No, I don't want
no scrubs... *

11:25.685 --> 11:27.020
ATHENA :
This is an emergency.

11:27.054 --> 11:28.922
I need you to back up.

11:28.956 --> 11:31.424
* Hangin' out the passenger's
side of his best friend's ride *

11:31.458 --> 11:33.693
* Tryin' to holla at me

11:33.727 --> 11:35.695
* Oh, oh...

11:35.729 --> 11:38.832
Hey, girl, give me four
cheeseburgers and fries.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.700
Put the fries
in another bag, okay?

11:40.734 --> 11:42.235
Oh, and a medium root beer.

11:43.904 --> 11:45.505
MAN:
Get out of here.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.540
Go fetch.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.878
Hey, hey!

11:52.079 --> 11:54.848
Hey. Animal Control
is on the way. Okay?

11:54.882 --> 11:56.049
But in the meantime,

11:56.083 --> 11:57.785
I would stop spraying them
with that.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.019
It's just gonna piss them off.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.420
What am I supposed to do?

12:00.453 --> 12:01.889
Stand still, stand still.

12:01.922 --> 12:03.356
The more activity they see,

12:03.390 --> 12:04.691
the more excited
they're gonna get.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.759
A-And don't look them
in the eyes.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.027
That's a challenge.

12:07.060 --> 12:08.728
Yeah, yeah. I'm going to, uh...

12:08.762 --> 12:10.730
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go see if,
uh, I can find the owners.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.766
And if you're thinking I'm
a coward for letting you deal

12:12.800 --> 12:15.068
with these hellhounds on your
own, uh, you are 100% correct.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.970
-I will, uh...
-Ch...

12:17.004 --> 12:19.706
Just-just stay calm.
Stay still.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.941
Hey. How big are they?

12:20.974 --> 12:22.409
Take a look.

12:24.244 --> 12:26.313
Oh, crap. Four bagger.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.448
I was hoping to save one
for lunch.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.117
You ready?

12:30.150 --> 12:31.418
I got your back.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.753
You have a gun?

12:33.787 --> 12:35.622
No, shooting them's just gonna
piss 'em off.

12:35.655 --> 12:37.290
I got something
much more effective.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.764
Okay.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.813
Mm-hmm.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.181
Got him.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.786
Thank you.

13:06.820 --> 13:10.357
You are a beautiful genius.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.169
Is he okay?

13:22.202 --> 13:23.703
Should be fine.

13:23.736 --> 13:27.374
We'll have Animal Control
test the dog for rabies.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.878
You, uh, happen to, uh, notice
what I noticed inside there?

13:30.911 --> 13:33.146
There was fire, smoke.

13:33.180 --> 13:34.681
What you talking about?

13:34.714 --> 13:38.218
I'm talking about that sweet
smile, them broad shoulders.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.520
Mr. Sweet Smile
was asking me about you.

13:40.553 --> 13:42.122
Hmm. Then he a bigger dog

13:42.155 --> 13:45.025
than the Dobermans,
'cause I still have my ring on.

13:45.058 --> 13:48.695
Athena.
Spoiler alert:

13:48.728 --> 13:50.964
your husband likes boys,

13:50.998 --> 13:52.900
so that ring ain't gonna
be on much longer.

13:54.935 --> 13:57.204
Well...

13:57.237 --> 13:59.973
for now, my vows still mean
something to me.

14:00.007 --> 14:02.575
And I-I couldn't do that
to my kids.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.811
This has been tough enough
on them already.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.813
I mean, I don't think
May's said more than two words

14:06.846 --> 14:08.982
to Michael or I
in the last week.

14:09.016 --> 14:13.753
Whatever happens
between you and Michael,

14:13.786 --> 14:15.588
these next few months
are gonna be hell,

14:15.622 --> 14:18.358
so whatever you need
to do to get through it

14:18.391 --> 14:20.827
so that you can be there
for your kids and for yourself,

14:20.860 --> 14:22.529
you might want to do it.

14:24.564 --> 14:28.201
Hen, when you got here, was that
slide door open or closed?

14:28.235 --> 14:29.802
Closed.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.373
So was the front door.

14:33.406 --> 14:36.476
Dogs can't get inside
unless they live here.

14:40.713 --> 14:42.082
What happened?

14:42.115 --> 14:44.517
Um... uh...

14:44.551 --> 14:46.786
What's going on, Officer?

14:46.819 --> 14:48.421
Sir, is this your house?

14:48.455 --> 14:51.258
Yeah, everything okay?
What happened to my dogs?

14:51.291 --> 14:52.692
Uh, the Dobermans?

14:52.725 --> 14:53.927
You'll be happy
to know they've been fed

14:53.961 --> 14:55.228
and they're safe.

14:55.262 --> 14:57.797
The problem is,
you've been burglarized,

14:57.830 --> 14:59.332
and I let him get away.

15:05.973 --> 15:07.407
NEWSWOMAN :
A sticky situation at an airport

15:07.440 --> 15:08.908
in Tennessee after baggage...

15:08.942 --> 15:11.478
She's down. She should be out
for a few hours.

15:11.511 --> 15:15.115
Oh. Thank the Lord.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.484
I'm a terrible person
for saying that.

15:17.517 --> 15:20.920
You're a good daughter because
you choose to take care of her,

15:20.954 --> 15:23.656
not because of how you feel
about it sometimes.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.725
You want a glass of wine?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.927
-You've earned it.

15:27.961 --> 15:30.897
Go get yourself a glass
in the kitchen.

15:30.930 --> 15:34.101
My husband and I are in a fight,
so I can't go home

15:34.134 --> 15:38.105
until he moves from the "I never
want to see her again" feeling

15:38.138 --> 15:42.309
to the "Oh, no, did I go too
far, is she ever coming back?

15:42.342 --> 15:44.411
I've got to treat her right
when she comes home" feeling.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.246
-I like your style.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.647
Thank you.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.849
Hmm.

15:49.882 --> 15:52.085
So, um, why are you not out
with Tommy tonight?

15:52.119 --> 15:54.754
-Oh. -Your mom keeps
telling me about him.

15:54.787 --> 15:58.925
Oh. Because the universe
thinks it's hilarious

15:58.958 --> 16:02.329
that I get to keep reliving
the worst breakup of my life

16:02.362 --> 16:04.431
because my mother keeps
forgetting that it happened.

16:04.464 --> 16:07.634
What was so bad about it?

16:07.667 --> 16:09.936
He broke up with me.

16:09.969 --> 16:11.204
And he did not have
my permission.

16:11.238 --> 16:13.140
Hmm.

16:13.173 --> 16:14.441
But I'll tell you the truth.

16:14.474 --> 16:18.211
Really, once my mom
moved in here...

16:18.245 --> 16:20.313
I really didn't have
anything else to give.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.881
And what guy's gonna want

16:21.914 --> 16:25.352
to be here with me with my mom
snoring in the other room?

16:25.385 --> 16:26.986
I mean, it's not sexy.

16:27.020 --> 16:28.788
NEWSMAN : ...with fireman
Evan "Buck" Buckley,

16:28.821 --> 16:31.491
who people are calling
the "County Fair Spider-Man"

16:31.524 --> 16:32.692
for his daring rescue.

16:32.725 --> 16:35.495
Holy crap, he's gone national.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.996
You know that big hunk
of man meat?

16:37.030 --> 16:38.865
-Mm.
-BUCK: I was just doing my job.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.568
I'm happy we were able
to help the people we helped

16:41.601 --> 16:44.837
and I'm-I'm really sorry
about those we-we couldn't save.

16:44.871 --> 16:47.374
NEWSWOMAN: Oh, we're getting
a lot of Twitter questions

16:47.407 --> 16:49.809
from our audience. Most just
want to know if you're single.

16:49.842 --> 16:53.313
Oh, uh, that's, uh,
that's very sweet of them,

16:53.346 --> 16:57.250
but, um, I'm sure they're
just turned on by the uniform.

16:57.284 --> 16:58.985
You know, I-I don't know
if they would feel that way

16:59.018 --> 17:00.487
if they saw me out of it.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.256
Oh, I-I don't mean it that way.

17:03.290 --> 17:06.226
NEWSWOMAN: Well, thanks, Buck,
and thanks for all you...

17:06.259 --> 17:09.362
Hmm. He didn't answer
the question.

17:09.396 --> 17:11.598
You want an answer
to the question?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.200
All firemen are dogs.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.034
And the ones that look
like the Road Warrior

17:15.068 --> 17:18.004
with an adorable birthmark are
the doggiest dogs of them all.

17:20.307 --> 17:24.344
I've been thinking I might want
to call him to see how he is.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.780
Mm, or how he is
about dating you?

17:27.814 --> 17:29.449
-No.
-Mm-hmm.

17:29.482 --> 17:31.451
He's a dog, you're a cougar.
Own it.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.720
-Uh, no, it is not like that.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.356
Look, you know what,
I save people's lives every day,

17:36.389 --> 17:40.527
and he is the first person
in years that actually has said,

17:40.560 --> 17:43.029
"Thank you, Abby, great job.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.397
You're a hero, too."

17:44.431 --> 17:46.099
And...

17:46.133 --> 17:48.067
he needs help, you know?

17:48.101 --> 17:50.703
I mean, he's got so much pain
in his face.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.405
Everybody's treating him
like a hero.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.640
He doesn't feel like a hero.

17:53.673 --> 17:56.042
As far as he's concerned,

17:56.075 --> 17:58.711
the guy that he was trying
to save fell.

17:58.745 --> 18:01.047
All right, well, go ahead on.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.950
I'm not leaving until I hear
how this turns out.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.619
Oh, I don't know.

18:06.653 --> 18:07.654
Call him.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.256
Mm...?

18:09.289 --> 18:10.623
Uh-huh.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.759
You know you want to.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.565
You just don't want to go home
to your husband.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.333
Not until he fixes his attitude.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.037
Closing this door.

18:45.525 --> 18:47.026
Yeah?

18:47.059 --> 18:49.929
Um, hi. It's-it's Abby Clark.

18:49.962 --> 18:53.132
We-we talked the other day
after the home invasion.

18:53.166 --> 18:54.501
I was the 911 operator.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.669
Oh, yeah, yeah, you were badass.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.206
Uh, how'd you get this number?

18:59.239 --> 19:00.940
Oh, well, it was in the report.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.842
Um, but, anyway, I just,

19:02.875 --> 19:04.844
I don't know,
I wanted to check on you.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.846
I've been seeing you
all over the news,

19:06.879 --> 19:09.549
and it seemed like maybe
you were having a hard time.

19:09.582 --> 19:13.386
Yeah, um, how'd you know?

19:13.420 --> 19:17.624
Uh, in my job you kind of learn
how to read people

19:17.657 --> 19:19.826
just based on the sound
of their voice.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.628
Thank you for noticing.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.997
Um, everywhere I go now people
are patting me on the back,

19:25.031 --> 19:26.833
and I just want
to scream back at them,

19:26.866 --> 19:27.834
"You know, people died.

19:27.867 --> 19:30.303
I had to watch them die."

19:30.337 --> 19:31.704
ABBY:
I know.

19:31.738 --> 19:34.374
I've had to listen
to people die before.

19:36.376 --> 19:40.247
The silence
after they stop talking is

19:40.280 --> 19:43.182
like no other kind of quiet.

19:43.216 --> 19:45.918
The guy who fell...

19:45.952 --> 19:49.556
all he had to do was grab my
hand, and I couldn't get him to.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.324
You know, believe it or not,

19:51.358 --> 19:53.092
there are some people who
actually take those moments

19:53.125 --> 19:57.397
as opportunities
to make that decision.

19:57.430 --> 20:01.167
I mean, there are some people
who just don't want to be saved.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.604
Um, thank you for calling me.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.574
Maybe I can call you
again sometime?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.208
Yeah, that'd be great.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.577
You have my number now

20:10.610 --> 20:14.914
or you can just dial 911.

20:14.947 --> 20:17.750
All right, uh, well,

20:17.784 --> 20:20.553
thanks and let's talk soon.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.790
Okay. Bye.

20:32.231 --> 20:33.566
LIZ:
My brother was

20:33.600 --> 20:37.136
a man of great potential.

20:37.169 --> 20:39.171
That's the hardest part for me.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.976
Thank you all for coming.

21:00.993 --> 21:02.829
Hi. I'm, uh,

21:02.862 --> 21:05.965
I'm Buck, uh, Evan.

21:05.998 --> 21:08.668
Look, I-I just wanted
to say how sorry I am.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.737
It's only my fourth month
on the job.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.572
I've never lost anyone
before this.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.474
What really happened up there?

21:14.507 --> 21:18.845
It was like he just...

21:18.878 --> 21:20.980
he gave up.

21:21.013 --> 21:23.249
Are you saying it's
my brother's fault he's dead?

21:23.282 --> 21:25.151
No, th-that's not what I mean.

21:25.184 --> 21:28.621
My brother was very h-happy

21:28.655 --> 21:31.458
to be alive.

21:31.491 --> 21:34.293
He was loved, and he knew it.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.764
He wanted to live,
and you failed him.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.799
*

21:54.313 --> 21:56.282
You know what sucks
about working?

21:56.315 --> 21:57.950
The work part.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.019
I'm gonna pretend
you didn't just say that.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.889
I'm serious.
Law school was a huge mistake.

22:02.922 --> 22:05.358
We should just come up
with an app or something.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.227
I mean, if it hits,
it is like winning the lottery.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.730
Winning the lottery is not
a life strategy, Stephanie.

22:10.763 --> 22:13.900
Neither is writing briefs
for a bunch of douches in suits

22:13.933 --> 22:15.868
defending
pharmaceutical companies.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.870
Your dad's the managing partner.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.338
Yeah.

22:21.541 --> 22:23.476
STEPHANIE:
This guy is such a creep.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.577
Who?

22:24.611 --> 22:25.712
Him.

22:25.745 --> 22:27.647
I'm pretty sure he took pictures

22:27.680 --> 22:29.882
of me in my office
a couple months ago.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.551
-So gross.

22:32.885 --> 22:34.921
Oh, my God, is he looking at me?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.656
Can he see us?

22:36.689 --> 22:38.324
Just act natural.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.992
-He's looking at me.
: Look away.

22:58.645 --> 23:00.346
I'm sorry, did you say
"pervy guy"?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.381
The window washer,
the thing snapped,

23:02.415 --> 23:05.351
his wires or whatever, and
he's just hanging by his foot.

23:05.384 --> 23:07.319
Tell me where you're
calling from, ma'am.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.736
All right, Buck,
that rig could go any second.

23:23.770 --> 23:26.439
I'm gonna go up to the roof
and secure the cable, all right?

23:26.473 --> 23:29.476
You go up on the ladder,
get it up to him. Let's go.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.611
Bob. Bob.

23:31.644 --> 23:34.447
I'll go up to the roof. You
know, I-I can get there quicker

23:34.481 --> 23:36.583
and make sure the,
the cable is secure.

23:38.350 --> 23:40.352
All right, good idea.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.132
*

24:06.045 --> 24:09.482
Don't. All right?
I-I know I let you down.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.761
A year ago,
I put in to be a Navy SEAL.

24:21.794 --> 24:24.130
I didn't know
you were in the Navy.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.932
I wasn't.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.502
Don't have to be in the Navy
to try out for the SEALs.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.104
You just have to be
particularly badass,

24:32.138 --> 24:34.774
which you know... I am.

24:34.807 --> 24:37.009
Didn't have any trouble
with the physical part.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.011
Following orders wasn't
my best quality,

24:39.045 --> 24:41.013
but hey, I was working on it.

24:43.015 --> 24:45.051
Why didn't it stick?

24:46.819 --> 24:49.856
They wanted machines.

24:49.889 --> 24:51.691
People who could, uh...

24:51.724 --> 24:53.860
flip a switch
in their head and...

24:53.893 --> 24:57.329
turn off every natural,
human instinctive emotion

24:57.363 --> 24:59.398
in their body,
and I cannot do that.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.400
I don't,
I don't want to do that.

25:01.433 --> 25:04.036
I love this job because
I get to be the tough guy

25:04.070 --> 25:06.673
but I also get to help people.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.543
Remember the first person
you lost?

25:18.785 --> 25:22.689
Katherine Vance-- 32 years old,
blonde hair, green eyes.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.391
She was wearing a blue
University of Michigan T-shirt,

25:25.424 --> 25:28.995
white shorts, and she had on
black Converse High Tops.

25:29.028 --> 25:32.565
She had painted smiley faces
on the toes.

25:34.567 --> 25:37.269
Last thing she said to me
was, "Please,"

25:37.303 --> 25:39.438
and then she was gone.

25:39.471 --> 25:42.775
Hit by a drunk driver--
I couldn't extract her in time.

25:42.809 --> 25:46.913
I'm glad you can't...
flip that switch.

25:46.946 --> 25:48.748
I don't want you to.

25:48.781 --> 25:51.083
It's not gonna make you
a better firefighter.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.252
And anybody who tells you
that losing someone

25:53.285 --> 25:55.722
doesn't affect them is lying.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.131
The name and number
of a trauma counselor.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.266
We have people in the department

26:07.299 --> 26:09.836
who help us deal
with this kind of stuff.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.908
You don't have to talk to me,

26:15.942 --> 26:18.010
but you do have
to talk to someone.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.582
*

26:34.794 --> 26:36.929
WELLES:
You seem uncomfortable.

26:36.963 --> 26:38.965
Yeah, I am a little.

26:38.998 --> 26:40.599
Well, that's not unusual.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.501
You've been through a trauma.

26:42.534 --> 26:45.437
That's why you're here--
to deal with those feelings.

26:45.471 --> 26:48.574
: Uh, yeah, I'm, uh,
I'm not really into feelings.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.177
I mean, I mean, feeling 'em,
yeah, just not, you know...

26:51.210 --> 26:53.012
talking about them.

26:53.045 --> 26:55.247
I treat a lot
of first responders--

26:55.281 --> 26:59.085
people who run toward danger--

26:59.118 --> 27:02.955
but maybe there's something
you're running from as well?

27:02.989 --> 27:06.859
What is it about discussing
your feelings that scares you?

27:06.893 --> 27:08.795
I'm not scared.

27:08.828 --> 27:10.596
I'm angry.

27:10.629 --> 27:12.598
GLASS:
That's good.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.433
It's good?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.602
It's good
that you're expressing it.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.304
Oh, yeah.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.439
I'm expressing it.

27:20.472 --> 27:22.274
BUCK:
Look,

27:22.308 --> 27:24.643
I'm only here
'cause my captain insisted.

27:24.677 --> 27:29.148
Yes. I understand you froze up
at a scene the other day.

27:29.181 --> 27:32.151
Yeah. Okay, I... I hesitated.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.820
Why?

27:33.853 --> 27:37.556
I just don't like...
to be made to feel a fool,

27:37.589 --> 27:40.359
and that's exactly how I feel
right about now.

27:42.528 --> 27:44.864
Because you were right, Michael.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.866
I did know.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.969
Somewhere, not that deep down,

27:50.002 --> 27:52.538
I always knew you were gay.

27:52.571 --> 27:54.506
But that's how badly

27:54.540 --> 27:58.644
I wanted to make a life
with you.

27:58.677 --> 28:00.446
A family.

28:04.216 --> 28:07.486
And I'm not ready to let it go.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.022
WELLES:
You lost somebody.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.657
That's hard.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.525
Yeah, but we lose people.

28:13.559 --> 28:16.062
At least that's what
everyone keeps telling me.

28:16.095 --> 28:17.663
Was this your first time?

28:17.696 --> 28:20.432
I mean, I've had calls
where it was... too late,

28:20.466 --> 28:24.236
but, uh, but I've only been
doing this not even six months.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.505
Now, I... I just
can't shake the feeling

28:26.538 --> 28:29.776
that this one didn't need
to go down the way that it did.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.778
So do you think
there was something

28:31.811 --> 28:33.412
you could have done differently?

28:35.381 --> 28:38.250
You... are nobody's fool.

28:38.284 --> 28:41.187
You are a strong, beautiful,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.189
loving woman.

28:43.222 --> 28:46.258
Listen, I'm the fool.

28:46.292 --> 28:48.060
I let you love me,

28:48.094 --> 28:50.062
because I thought
you could fix me.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.066
WELLES:
Do you blame him?

28:55.601 --> 28:58.237
I mean, he wouldn't take
my hand.

28:58.270 --> 28:59.638
Maybe he couldn't.

28:59.671 --> 29:03.709
Maybe he was too paralyzed
with fear,

29:03.742 --> 29:06.712
or confused or...

29:06.745 --> 29:07.947
who knows?

29:07.980 --> 29:09.348
Look...

29:12.518 --> 29:15.121
I can't help you get
inside his head, Mr. Buckley.

29:15.154 --> 29:17.957
-We're here to talk about
what's inside yours.

29:17.990 --> 29:20.326
It's, um...

29:20.359 --> 29:23.062
it's actually just Buck.

29:23.095 --> 29:25.397
:
Okay.

29:26.966 --> 29:29.668
:
Um... can I ask you something?

29:29.701 --> 29:31.137
Of course.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.172
Did you friend me on Facebook?

29:36.042 --> 29:38.077
I saw you on the news,

29:38.110 --> 29:41.113
um, before this was scheduled.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.351
You should delete that.

29:45.384 --> 29:48.687
Yeah, I thought
you looked familiar.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.626
Nobody is trying to take away
your family, Athena.

29:56.495 --> 29:59.966
Baby, we still got
a whole lot to hold onto.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.868
I agree.

30:01.901 --> 30:06.305
And I'm willing to go down
that road with you, Michael.

30:06.338 --> 30:09.175
And what does that road
look like to you, Athena?

30:09.208 --> 30:12.811
-I-I couldn't live with
a loveless marriage. -Right.

30:12.845 --> 30:15.347
But a sexless one?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.987
Well, it's already been that
for a while now,

30:21.020 --> 30:24.156
so I guess we're just at
the point in our lives where...

30:24.190 --> 30:26.025
we can live without it.

30:26.058 --> 30:28.627
So if... you can live

30:28.660 --> 30:32.064
a celibate life, Michael,
I can, too.

30:34.066 --> 30:37.669
-Uh...

30:37.703 --> 30:40.639
*

30:42.408 --> 30:44.243
What?

30:46.512 --> 30:48.080
Michael?

30:48.114 --> 30:50.316
I met someone...

30:50.349 --> 30:52.651
Athena.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.653
I met someone.

31:00.059 --> 31:01.727
Oh, God.

31:07.799 --> 31:10.769
I can't believe I just did that.

31:10.802 --> 31:12.771
I am so sorry.

31:12.804 --> 31:14.873
Sorry
You were fantastic.

31:14.907 --> 31:17.276
That was beyond unprofessional.

31:17.309 --> 31:19.111
I'm your therapist.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.580
Yeah, and I feel better.

31:21.613 --> 31:23.515
You need to go.

31:23.549 --> 31:24.816
Now.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.064
*

31:51.610 --> 31:52.778
MAN :
Hello.

31:52.811 --> 31:54.380
Hey, boo.

31:54.413 --> 31:55.914
MAN:
Who is this?

31:55.948 --> 31:57.249
"Who is this?"

31:57.283 --> 31:58.750
Oh, come on now.

31:58.784 --> 32:01.220
I'm disappointed in you.

32:01.253 --> 32:03.222
I thought you and I
had something.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.057
I hate to disappoint, but you're
gonna have to refresh my memory.

32:05.091 --> 32:07.726
Yeah, well, I guess
it has been a minute.

32:07.759 --> 32:09.895
I was married.

32:09.928 --> 32:13.299
You told me to call you
when I needed a real man.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.900
Well, here I am.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.068
Well, here you are.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.937
So, uh, you gonna

32:18.971 --> 32:20.906
come get this, huh?

32:22.041 --> 32:23.609
Well, that depends
on what you had in mind.

32:23.642 --> 32:24.776
You can meet me at my place

32:24.810 --> 32:27.513
for a little afternoon delight,

32:27.546 --> 32:29.115
if you know what I'm saying.

32:29.148 --> 32:30.349
Afternoon delight?

32:30.382 --> 32:32.351
Girl, you need to update
your euphemisms.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.187
Okay, okay, where you at?

32:35.221 --> 32:37.289
Mmm, I'm not far.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.357
How do you know?

32:38.390 --> 32:40.159
You like dogs?

32:40.192 --> 32:41.927
Dobermans?

32:41.960 --> 32:44.930
I have one at my place.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.365
Who is this?

32:46.398 --> 32:47.933
How did you get this number?

32:47.966 --> 32:51.070
You called 911, dumb ass.

33:08.187 --> 33:10.156
No, no, no, no.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.360
-You think you can just

33:14.393 --> 33:16.528
make me look like a fool
and walk away

33:16.562 --> 33:18.964
Sergeant Grant, easy!

33:18.997 --> 33:20.366
Easy.

33:52.264 --> 33:53.632
And tell me
where you're calling from.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.004
WOMAN:
Leonard!

33:59.037 --> 34:00.706
Will you please just
get the hell down from there?

34:00.739 --> 34:02.174
Okay, you're scaring me.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.942
LEONARD:
After all that I do for you?

34:03.975 --> 34:06.044
I do whatever you tell me to!

34:06.078 --> 34:07.746
WOMAN: That's part
of the problem, Leonard!

34:07.779 --> 34:09.748
And then you go and cheat on me

34:09.781 --> 34:11.783
with some werewolf-looking dick
from work?

34:11.817 --> 34:13.119
I did not cheat on you, okay?

34:13.152 --> 34:14.753
How many times
do I have to say this?!

34:14.786 --> 34:17.856
You need to say it more
because I do not believe you.

34:17.889 --> 34:20.126
Seriously?
It's got to be a jumper?

34:20.159 --> 34:22.594
He couldn't threaten himself
with a gun?

34:22.628 --> 34:24.796
Right.
'Cause that would be preferable.

34:24.830 --> 34:26.465
OFFICER :
Bedroom door is locked.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.300
The girlfriend is
on the living room balcony.

34:28.334 --> 34:31.270
We're gonna have
to do The Maneuver.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.638
Oh, Bobby, no, I...

34:32.671 --> 34:34.640
-Yes.
-I'll do it.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.175
No, Buck's got this.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.011
You got this.

34:42.414 --> 34:46.485
Why did you move in
if I am so terrible?

34:46.518 --> 34:48.487
You're not that terrible.
Will you please get down

34:48.520 --> 34:50.222
so we can talk about
how you can improve?

34:50.256 --> 34:51.623
I don't think I need to improve.

34:51.657 --> 34:53.292
Fine. You want to jump?

34:53.325 --> 34:54.960
Go ahead and jump!

34:54.993 --> 34:57.062
I don't even know
what to say to him anymore.

34:57.095 --> 34:58.830
Telling him to jump
is probably not the way to go.

34:58.864 --> 35:00.232
He will not listen to me, okay?

35:00.266 --> 35:01.667
He's convinced
that I cheated on him,

35:01.700 --> 35:02.934
and we keep going in circles.

35:02.968 --> 35:05.271
Don't you dare do that,
I swear to God!

35:05.304 --> 35:06.838
Did you cheat on him?

35:06.872 --> 35:08.106
This is the right time for that?

35:08.140 --> 35:09.908
-So, that's a yes.
-No, it isn't.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.411
-Just tell him you're sorry.
-Absolutely not.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.146
Okay, I'm not gonna admit
that I cheated on him.

35:14.180 --> 35:15.581
It doesn't have to be true.

35:15.614 --> 35:17.015
He just needs to hear
that you're sorry.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.650
All right?

35:18.684 --> 35:20.986
Fine. Leonard?

35:21.019 --> 35:22.354
I'm sorry.

35:22.388 --> 35:24.089
Okay, I don't know
what I was thinking.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.357
I love you and only you.

35:25.391 --> 35:27.859
You lying bitch.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.995
Oh, fine!

35:30.028 --> 35:31.197
I mean, that was pathetic.

35:31.230 --> 35:32.498
Oh, come on, I tried my best.

35:32.531 --> 35:33.932
Hey. Leonard, listen to me.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.267
We've all been there, man.

35:35.301 --> 35:39.137
I had a girlfriend
cheat on me and...

35:39.171 --> 35:41.207
I thought she was the one,
Leonard.

35:41.240 --> 35:42.608
I saw us going the whole way.

35:42.641 --> 35:46.278
Marriage, kids, all of it.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.847
So I went out and
I bought her a ring,

35:48.880 --> 35:51.016
a nice one.

35:51.049 --> 35:52.984
I mean, we were on top
of the Eiffel Tower.

35:54.920 --> 35:56.322
I got down on one knee.

35:56.355 --> 35:59.024
I popped the question.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.727
Everybody staring at us.

36:01.760 --> 36:03.862
She had tears in her eyes.

36:03.895 --> 36:05.497
You know what she said to me?

36:05.531 --> 36:07.333
:
Now.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.734
She says to me, "Bobby..."

36:19.278 --> 36:21.247
The girl, on the Eiffel Tower.

36:21.280 --> 36:24.516
I don't know. We never get
that far in the story.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.590
Hey, Bobby, um...

36:31.623 --> 36:34.360
thanks for pushing me
back there.

36:34.393 --> 36:35.927
I don't know what happened.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.363
I guess I had a moment.

36:37.396 --> 36:39.931
You bounced back
and saved a man's life.

36:39.965 --> 36:41.667
You did good, kid.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.069
Five bucks says that guy's
getting laid tonight.

36:45.103 --> 36:46.672
A guy ready to kill himself,

36:46.705 --> 36:48.607
and you think his girlfriend
is turned on?

36:48.640 --> 36:50.175
He was punishing her
for cheating.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.043
Guilt sex.
Help me out here, Buck.

37:05.957 --> 37:09.795
I need to apologize to you.

37:09.828 --> 37:12.030
I was completely out of line
at the memorial.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.031
You didn't deserve that.

37:13.064 --> 37:15.401
You lost your brother.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.102
I get it.

37:17.135 --> 37:21.540
Seven years ago,
Devon tried to kill himself.

37:21.573 --> 37:25.811
We sent him to therapy
and he got better.

37:25.844 --> 37:27.313
Then, two months ago,

37:27.346 --> 37:29.715
he started isolating
himself again.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.149
Wouldn't leave the house.

37:31.182 --> 37:35.421
I got scared and called
his friend, Chad.

37:35.454 --> 37:38.223
Begged him to get Devon
out of the house.

37:38.256 --> 37:43.094
Chad said he'd ask Devon
to go to the state fair.

37:43.128 --> 37:44.963
When Devon said yes to the fair,

37:44.996 --> 37:48.166
I took it as a sign
that he was getting better.

37:48.199 --> 37:50.302
So, you see,

37:50.336 --> 37:54.806
it's not your fault he's dead.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.309
It's mine.

37:57.343 --> 38:00.145
Look, there was nothing

38:00.178 --> 38:02.614
either one of us
could've done for Devon.

38:04.182 --> 38:08.320
Some people just don't want
to be saved.

38:08.354 --> 38:11.022
A friend said that
to me recently.

38:11.056 --> 38:14.159
And, um... it helped.

38:25.371 --> 38:26.805
-MOM: Mmm.
-ABBY: Well, this is nice.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.640
We don't get to go out
very often, do we, Mom?

38:28.674 --> 38:30.809
Mm-mm. Carla got me
all dolled up.

38:30.842 --> 38:32.478
-Yes, yes, I did.
-Mm.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.480
CARLA: It's good to get
different kinds of stimulation.

38:34.513 --> 38:37.315
Releases that serotonin,
that happy hormone.

38:37.349 --> 38:41.019
Well, we could all use
a little happy hormone.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.788
Abby, you're in the prime
of your life, girl.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.289
You need to get out
and have some fun.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.124
You need to ask out

38:46.157 --> 38:48.460
that fireman that looks like
he got punched in the eye.

38:48.494 --> 38:50.662
I'm not asking out that fireman.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.197
He's way too young for me.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.701
Girl, you are
a hot spice pumpkin latte.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.636
You're sitting around,
getting cool,

38:57.669 --> 38:59.037
and there's
a big old hunk of man

38:59.070 --> 39:01.306
that would love
to burn his tongue on you.

39:01.339 --> 39:04.242
-Oh.

39:06.344 --> 39:08.046
Mm

39:08.079 --> 39:11.650
:
Call him.

39:11.683 --> 39:13.318
-You're so pushy.
-Mm-hmm.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.821
-But you like it.
-Okay, I'll be back.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.089
-Wait, I want to hear this.
-No.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.067
Hello.

39:29.100 --> 39:32.037
Hey. Buck, it's, uh,
it's Abby Clark.

39:32.070 --> 39:33.839
Ah, hey.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.574
Hey. How you doing?

39:35.607 --> 39:38.043
I'm good. Hey, can I ask you
a question?

39:38.076 --> 39:40.045
-Sure.

39:40.078 --> 39:41.713
Oh, my God, why?

39:41.747 --> 39:44.683
'Cause you keep calling me.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.452
People don't use their phones
to make calls anymore.

39:46.485 --> 39:47.619
You know, we text,

39:47.653 --> 39:50.055
we Snap or we Marco Polo,

39:50.088 --> 39:52.758
or if it's really serious,
then we FaceTime.

39:54.493 --> 39:56.695
I guess that's true,
I know I'm...

39:56.728 --> 40:00.365
sorry, I just, you know, I spend
so much time on the phone.

40:00.398 --> 40:04.069
I guess it's my most comfortable
form of communication.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.572
Nah, don't be sorry. I like it.

40:06.605 --> 40:08.774
It's, um, it's old-fashioned.

40:08.807 --> 40:11.977
Yes, well, um...

40:12.010 --> 40:16.214
I have
another old-fashioned idea,

40:16.247 --> 40:20.986
which is that I was thinking
maybe we could...

40:21.019 --> 40:23.054
meet up in person

40:23.088 --> 40:26.157
over some
old-fashioned margaritas.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.660
Ah, see, where I'm from, they,
uh, they call that a date.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.095
:
Yeah.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.163
They call it a date
where I'm from, too.

40:32.197 --> 40:34.299
I'm asking you out on a date.

40:34.332 --> 40:37.068
Um, I mean,
that sounds really fun.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.804
You're-you're super smart
and funny

40:38.837 --> 40:41.006
and obviously killer
at your job, um,

40:41.039 --> 40:42.641
but I'm-I'm realizing that

40:42.674 --> 40:45.911
I have some issues when
it comes to women and intimacy.

40:45.944 --> 40:47.979
And if, uh, if we
went out on a date,

40:48.013 --> 40:50.181
I'm pretty sure we'd have sex.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.318
Uh, okay.

40:53.351 --> 40:55.153
You think I would just
sleep with you?

40:55.186 --> 40:56.922
I'm not sure
what to make of that.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.424
No, look, it's, um,

40:59.457 --> 41:01.927
it's not you, it's,
it's not you, it's me.

41:01.960 --> 41:06.331
Um, look, I have issues.

41:06.364 --> 41:07.933
For example, I just slept
with my therapist

41:07.966 --> 41:09.334
in our first session.

41:09.367 --> 41:11.837
It's kind of like I'm a magnet.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.505
Oh, so you think
I'm not gonna be able

41:13.539 --> 41:15.206
to control myself around you?

41:15.240 --> 41:17.142
Because, right now, I mean,
in this conversation,

41:17.175 --> 41:21.046
I'm extremely not interested
in sleeping with you, so...

41:21.079 --> 41:24.215
I won't go out with you
because I like you.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.451
'Cause I know we've only talked
a couple times,

41:26.484 --> 41:29.220
but talking to you makes me
feel really good

41:29.254 --> 41:32.891
and safe and curious about life

41:32.924 --> 41:36.194
because I can tell
that you're special.

41:36.227 --> 41:38.797
And I don't have anyone
like you in my life

41:38.830 --> 41:40.832
and I don't want to do anything
to risk losing you.

41:40.866 --> 41:43.535
For now I think it's best
if we just

41:43.569 --> 41:46.037
talk on the phone,

41:46.071 --> 41:47.539
like in the olden days.

41:47.573 --> 41:48.807
I'd be into that.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.676
That would be great.

41:50.709 --> 41:53.344
All right, well,
then I'll talk to you soon.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.580
Bye, Buck.

41:54.613 --> 41:57.115
Good-bye, Abby.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.025
He said no.

42:07.058 --> 42:08.493
CARLA:
Then why are you smiling?

42:08.526 --> 42:12.931
Because I had the nerve
to call the guy.

42:12.964 --> 42:17.703
And sometimes
the right kind of no

42:17.736 --> 42:21.439
is better than
the wrong kind of yes.

42:21.472 --> 42:22.574
I like that.

42:34.953 --> 42:37.589
Hey, baby.

42:37.623 --> 42:39.691
How was your day?

42:39.725 --> 42:40.959
-Mm.
-Great.

42:40.992 --> 42:42.594
Good.

42:42.628 --> 42:44.295
Oh. Dad called.

42:44.329 --> 42:46.131
He said we could eat dinner
without him.

42:46.164 --> 42:48.399
I'll bet he did.

42:48.433 --> 42:51.069
Where's your sister?

42:51.102 --> 42:52.270
In her room.

42:54.272 --> 42:56.642
Ooh. May!

42:56.675 --> 42:58.476
Honey, you hungry?

43:00.278 --> 43:02.614
May, honey,
have you eaten anything?

43:02.648 --> 43:05.884
Damn headphones
with that music up so loud.

43:05.917 --> 43:07.352
Hey.

43:10.355 --> 43:12.490
Oh, my God.

43:12.523 --> 43:14.059
Oh, my God, oh, my God!

43:14.092 --> 43:17.295
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

43:17.328 --> 43:21.700
May. May. Oh, God.

44:12.050 --> 44:14.019
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

44:14.052 --> 44:16.688
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.325
Family is everything.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.460
I grew up
in the south of France.

44:22.493 --> 44:24.295
My mother
was a dressmaker.

44:24.329 --> 44:26.798
My father was
a Philippine general.

44:26.832 --> 44:29.500
The first dress I ever made
was for my sister.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.169
I have a doctorate
from Yale.

44:31.202 --> 44:32.904
I design
from the heart.

44:32.938 --> 44:34.672
I build ocean liners.

44:34.706 --> 44:36.641
Art...

44:36.674 --> 44:38.476
is the passion
of my life.

44:38.509 --> 44:40.611
When I see
something I want...

44:41.612 --> 44:42.948
I take it.

44:54.525 --> 44:57.729
-Do you know where I can find
Dr. Conrad Hawkins?
-You found him.

44:57.763 --> 45:02.267
HAWKINS:
Everything you thought you knew
about medicine is wrong.

45:02.300 --> 45:04.770
I have only one rule.
Covers everything.
I'm never wrong.

45:04.803 --> 45:07.072
You do whatever the hell
I tell you,

45:07.105 --> 45:09.707
no questions asked.

45:11.910 --> 45:14.679
What drew me into the show
was the medical drama itself.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.348
This was a different peek
into the genre that's beloved,

45:17.382 --> 45:19.751
but came at it
from a different perspective.

45:19.785 --> 45:22.020
HAWKINS: All we want to do
is help our patients,

45:22.053 --> 45:25.623
but what they don't teach us
in medical school is there are
so many ways to do harm.

45:25.656 --> 45:28.626
Conrad, he's real,
he's about the patients.

45:28.659 --> 45:32.197
He's about saving lives.
He's not about the business
side of this hospital.

45:32.230 --> 45:35.533
The decision was made
for medical reasons alone.

45:35.566 --> 45:37.702
I think we both know
that's not the truth.

45:37.735 --> 45:40.238
I'll cut you some slack
because you're upset.

45:40.271 --> 45:42.073
It's always interesting
for the audience

45:42.107 --> 45:44.575
when you see the personal
and professional lives

45:44.609 --> 45:46.377
combine and collide.

45:46.411 --> 45:48.814
I think we see that
through the Conrad and Nic
relationship.

45:48.847 --> 45:51.449
I took that photo.

45:51.482 --> 45:53.284
"No gamers, no slackers,
no doctors."

45:53.318 --> 45:54.986
That's pretty clear.

45:55.020 --> 45:59.424
There is
this "will they-won't they"
kind of aspect to the story line

45:59.457 --> 46:03.228
because Conrad is not
emotionally available,
and Nic is.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.196
I'll do whatever it takes
to get you back.

46:06.798 --> 46:10.668
We kind of see this guy
who's a hero for the little guy,

46:10.701 --> 46:12.637
and that was something
that I really responded to

46:12.670 --> 46:14.505
in terms of this character
in a big way.

46:14.539 --> 46:18.243
Ultimately, he is a caring
and gifted doctor.

46:18.276 --> 46:20.946
From now on,
she's your patient.

46:20.979 --> 46:23.614
But if you
screw this one up,
I will wreck you.

46:23.648 --> 46:27.418
What I love about this show
is that we're kind of
showing those truths
