00:01.869 --> 00:03.437
Hilda, I am so proud of you.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.405
Who would have thought
that my sister would head

00:05.405 --> 00:08.842
the charity even to benefit
the Westbridge Library?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.477
Not me.

00:10.477 --> 00:13.680
Considering the last book she
read was <i>Yertle the Turtle.</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:15.616
Sabrina, pass me
that hockey stick.

00:15.616 --> 00:16.984
I just found a new puck.

00:16.984 --> 00:17.951
Face-off.

00:18.285 --> 00:20.120
Oh, have mercy, miladies!

00:20.120 --> 00:22.489
Remember,
charity begins at home.

00:22.489 --> 00:24.091
Oh, you're right.

00:24.091 --> 00:26.126
Should we donate him to Goodwill
or the neighbor's Rottweiler?

00:26.126 --> 00:26.760
( <i>gasps</i> )

00:26.760 --> 00:28.028
Speaking of donations

00:28.028 --> 00:29.596
have you taken my idea
to auction off

00:29.596 --> 00:31.654
a celeb for a dream date?

00:31.654 --> 00:32.866
Yeah, Brad Pitt said
it's a tossup

00:32.866 --> 00:35.269
between this and the picnic
for the 4-H Club.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.703
There's got to be people willing

00:36.703 --> 00:38.539
to auction themselves off
for a good cause.

00:38.539 --> 00:40.507
Sure, Joe Schmoe will auction
himself off.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.075
The trick is finding someone hot

00:42.075 --> 00:43.677
who people will pay
big bucks for.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.313
There is <i>someone</i> I can get you
who's guaranteed

00:46.313 --> 00:49.049
to send people reaching
deep into their wallets.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.250
Mel Gibson?

00:50.250 --> 00:51.418
Mary, Queen of Scots?

00:51.418 --> 00:52.619
Cedric the Entertainer?

00:52.619 --> 00:54.288
Me.

00:56.156 --> 00:57.558
Wow, Zellie, you look great.

00:57.558 --> 00:58.559
Yeah, fantastic.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.760
You know, a date with you

00:59.760 --> 01:01.828
will definitely get
the library a new wing

01:01.828 --> 01:03.030
maybe even a new branch.

01:03.030 --> 01:04.264
Puh-lease!

01:04.264 --> 01:05.566
Put <i>me</i> in that gown

01:05.566 --> 01:08.468
and you would have taken <i>me</i>
in a hot minute.

01:08.468 --> 01:09.636
Mmm!

01:10.070 --> 01:11.071
No, definitely not.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.239
Mm-mmm.
No, uh-uh.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.780
Oh! Agh!

01:53.780 --> 01:54.915
Lovely.

01:54.915 --> 01:57.818
That was going
to be <i>my</i> line.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.486
Wow, Derek.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.955
I never thought
I'd see <i>you</i> again.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.358
Yeah, I guess things didn't
end on the best of terms

02:04.358 --> 02:07.060
but, uh, I wanted to let you
know that I've changed a lot.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.563
Apparently. I see you're
carrying a very big purse.

02:09.563 --> 02:10.664
( <i>chuckling</i> )

02:10.664 --> 02:11.798
Actually, it's
my portfolio.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.899
I've been painting.

02:12.899 --> 02:14.267
People actually
like my stuff.

02:14.267 --> 02:16.136
I'm going to be having
my own show soon.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.437
Wow, that's fantastic.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.939
Yeah, how about you?
Your writing?

02:18.939 --> 02:21.174
Got Woodward and Bernstein
shaking in their boots?

02:21.174 --> 02:22.242
Oh, I'm just an intern.

02:22.242 --> 02:23.877
But I'm working
on a big story.

02:23.877 --> 02:25.545
"Ordering Lunchgate."

02:25.545 --> 02:27.914
Yeah, well, I've been working
at the <i>Boston Citizen.</i>

02:27.914 --> 02:30.717
Josh is a photographer there,
and he turned me on to the gig.

02:30.717 --> 02:32.152
Josh...? Josh!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.154
Oh, that was your
on-again/off-again guy, right?

02:34.154 --> 02:35.555
<i>Was.</i> But we've been

02:35.555 --> 02:37.324
very much on for the
last eight months.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.959
Good for him.
He got a great girl.

02:38.959 --> 02:40.260
Thanks. Well, you mind

02:40.260 --> 02:42.496
if I take a peek at
some of your work?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.665
I thought you'd never ask.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.767
You know,
I didn't know

02:46.767 --> 02:48.935
that you were
interested in art.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.205
Oh, wow!

02:52.205 --> 02:54.107
These are <i>good.</i>

02:54.107 --> 02:55.575
What do you call this one?

02:55.575 --> 02:56.977
<i>Incantations.</i>

02:56.977 --> 02:58.278
Wow, I love it.

02:58.278 --> 03:00.547
I mean, it's got such
a range of emotion.

03:00.547 --> 03:02.983
You know, the blues
are so seductive

03:02.983 --> 03:05.118
and the reds are
so passionate.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.887
Yeah, the green
represents rebirth.

03:06.887 --> 03:08.455
Yeah, I got that.

03:08.455 --> 03:10.991
Wow, I could get
completely lost
in this painting.

03:10.991 --> 03:13.360
Derek, you have
so much depth.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.128
What are you doing?

03:15.128 --> 03:17.330
I thought I felt some of
the old electricity between us.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.766
You know me. I'm passionate.
I like to grab the moment.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.436
Yeah, I'm passionate,
and I like to grab
my boyfriend, Josh.

03:22.436 --> 03:25.072
And then out of nowhere,
we're in a lip lock.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.273
Oh, my God.

03:26.273 --> 03:27.974
I can't believe
you kissed him!

03:27.974 --> 03:29.743
I didn't kiss him.
He kissed me.

03:29.743 --> 03:30.844
Tongue?

03:30.844 --> 03:33.313
What? I'm trying
to act interested.

03:33.313 --> 03:35.549
Oh, this is
such total dish.

03:35.549 --> 03:37.350
Morgan, don't you dare say
anything to anyone.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.286
The last thing Sabrina needs
is Josh finding out

03:39.286 --> 03:41.121
before she's had a chance
to tell him herself.

03:41.121 --> 03:42.355
Are you insane?

03:42.355 --> 03:44.324
Sabrina can't tell
Josh what happened.

03:44.324 --> 03:45.292
ALL:
Why not?

03:45.292 --> 03:46.760
Because if she does

03:46.760 --> 03:48.695
her relationship will be over.

03:48.695 --> 03:51.198
Men see the world
in black and white.

03:51.198 --> 03:52.332
I beg to differ.

03:52.332 --> 03:55.702
My day is often
a pale palette of gray.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.170
A kiss is a kiss

03:57.170 --> 03:59.106
no matter who initiated it.

03:59.106 --> 04:01.174
If you tell Josh,
he'll be furious

04:01.174 --> 04:04.344
get insanely jealous,
break up with you, end of story.

04:04.344 --> 04:06.713
Don't you think Josh is deeper
and more enlightened than that?

04:06.713 --> 04:07.948
The guy dated Morgan.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.015
Good point.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.652
So, according to <i>your</i> scenario,
Sabrina keeps her mouth shut

04:12.652 --> 04:14.721
Josh finds out from
some stranger off the street

04:14.721 --> 04:16.089
and never trusts Sabrina again.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.624
Hey, if it ever comes to that

04:17.624 --> 04:20.127
Sabrina just denies
the whole thing completely.

04:20.127 --> 04:21.895
You know, I have
to agree with Roxie.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.930
I-I could never feel
comfortable with Josh

04:23.930 --> 04:26.233
if I had to carry around
this big, dark secret.

04:26.233 --> 04:27.367
You know, I mean

04:27.367 --> 04:28.802
how many secrets
can one girl handle?

04:28.802 --> 04:30.470
What other secrets
are you carrying around?

04:30.470 --> 04:32.839
Long story.

04:32.839 --> 04:34.040
Hey, Josh.

04:34.040 --> 04:35.041
Hey.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.343
How's it going?

04:36.343 --> 04:38.578
Good. I mean, not good...
You kn... well, not bad.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.813
It might sound bad

04:39.813 --> 04:42.382
but I think if you hear me out,
you'll realize

04:42.382 --> 04:44.084
that I'm absolutely crazy
about you

04:44.084 --> 04:45.685
and there's no need
to overreact.

04:45.685 --> 04:47.621
Are you all right?
I am. And I think
you will be too

04:47.621 --> 04:49.289
if you listen carefully

04:49.289 --> 04:50.724
and try not to jump
to conclusions.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.626
Sabrina, what's going on?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.628
Derek stopped by
the coffeehouse
last night.

04:54.628 --> 04:57.330
Derek? Wait, that guy
you used to date?

04:57.330 --> 04:58.732
Yeah, he's an artist now.

04:58.732 --> 05:00.834
And he wanted to show me
some of his paintings.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.370
You know, they were
decent-- blues, reds,
that sort of thing.

05:03.370 --> 05:05.205
Anyway, before I knew
it, Derek kissed me.

05:05.205 --> 05:07.207
Really?
Wait! You said
you'd hear me out.

05:07.207 --> 05:09.142
The kiss came out of
absolutely nowhere.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.343
I immediately pushed him away

05:10.343 --> 05:11.611
told him that he was
out of line

05:11.611 --> 05:13.246
and that you and I
are totally together.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.382
It meant absolutely nothing.
You have to believe me!

05:15.382 --> 05:17.150
I do believe you.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.185
You do?

05:18.185 --> 05:19.586
Of course.
You couldn't help it

05:19.586 --> 05:20.987
if the guy's still
hot for you.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.156
Now I've got to finish
organizing these photos.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.025
I don't know, you know.
It just couldn't

05:25.025 --> 05:26.960
have been very easy
for you to hear this.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.262
And I want you to
know that you don't
have to bury

05:29.262 --> 05:31.731
your overwhelming
jealousy and rage
behind your work.

05:31.731 --> 05:33.333
I gotcha.
Now Mike needed these

05:33.333 --> 05:34.835
on his desk
five minutes ago.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.803
I'll call you later.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.973
Well, that went well.

05:40.407 --> 05:42.108
I guess.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.544
Should I auction off
my hula hoop separately

05:44.544 --> 05:46.379
or package it with
this cauldron?

05:46.379 --> 05:47.948
Hilda, you're
supposed to come up

05:47.948 --> 05:50.083
with stuff that people
actually want to <i>buy.</i>

05:50.083 --> 05:52.185
At least you've got <i>one</i> item

05:52.185 --> 05:54.621
that's guaranteed
to bring in the big bucks.

05:56.423 --> 05:59.426
I remember when I was bought
at an auction by Charlemagne.

05:59.826 --> 06:01.962
I went for six chickens
and Prussia.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.865
So, how did it go?

06:04.865 --> 06:07.834
Definitely not the way
I expected.

06:07.834 --> 06:09.069
I knew it!
I told you.

06:09.069 --> 06:10.770
Wow, I'm shocked.
Josh always struck me

06:10.770 --> 06:12.539
as the kind of guy
who would understand.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.307
That's just it.
He <i>did</i> understand.

06:14.307 --> 06:15.642
I told him about the kiss.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.677
He said he trusted me,
kissed me on the cheek

06:17.677 --> 06:18.979
and said he'd call me later.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.280
Sabrina, that's great.

06:20.280 --> 06:22.382
Yeah, even I would
have been compelled

06:22.382 --> 06:23.950
to mumble a
mild profanity.

06:23.950 --> 06:26.786
Well, if it's so great,
then why do I feel unsatisfied?

06:26.786 --> 06:30.390
Duh! Because you were expecting
a more passionate response.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.491
The guy who
is supposed

06:31.491 --> 06:34.227
to be in love with you
is treating you

06:34.227 --> 06:36.830
like you're his sister
or a roommate

06:36.830 --> 06:39.165
or a sofa or a <i>dog</i> or a...

06:39.165 --> 06:41.201
Okay, I get the picture.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.836
I think the fact
that Josh didn't get

06:42.836 --> 06:44.604
all emotional and crazy
is a good thing.

06:44.604 --> 06:47.107
No, Josh putting his
fist through a wall
is a good thing.

06:47.107 --> 06:49.576
"I trust you, honey,"
peck on the cheek:

06:49.576 --> 06:51.144
kiss of death.

06:51.144 --> 06:54.981
Okay, now I'm unsatisfied
<i>and</i> confused.

06:54.981 --> 06:57.684
Well, Hilda, it looks like

06:57.684 --> 06:59.753
your charity auction
is a smashing success.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.321
Thanks, Zellie.
And thank you, Harvey

07:01.321 --> 07:03.189
for volunteering
to serve the hors d'oeuvres.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.558
Oh, my pleasure.
I also wanted to see how much

07:05.558 --> 07:08.094
personalized Harvey Kinkle
hockey sticks go for.

07:08.094 --> 07:09.763
I'm guessing big bucks.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.898
I bundled them
with my hula hoop

07:11.898 --> 07:14.467
and a basket
of perfumed soaps.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.269
Oh, look, Zellie.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.405
Someone's coming
to bid on you.

07:18.405 --> 07:19.472
Hmm...

07:20.774 --> 07:23.877
"Enjoy a delightful evening
of intellectual discourse

07:23.877 --> 07:25.812
"with a brilliant,
stunning Ph.D.

07:25.812 --> 07:27.080
"who's been published

07:27.080 --> 07:29.049
"in countless
scientific journals.

07:29.049 --> 07:31.952
See addendum for other
irresistible credentials."

07:31.952 --> 07:34.287
I wrote it myself.
What do you think?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.923
Unless William F. Buckley
shows up, I hope you've got

07:36.923 --> 07:38.558
swimsuit photos
in the addendum.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.462
Wow, he didn't even <i>make it</i>
to the addendum.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.698
Well, he was obviously
too intimidated to bid

07:44.698 --> 07:47.267
with his fantasy woman
standing right here.

07:47.267 --> 07:49.402
Maybe it's best if I
slip away quietly

07:49.402 --> 07:51.237
so the bidding
frenzy can begin.

07:51.237 --> 07:53.173
You're the genius
of the family.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.476
( <i>loudly</i> ):
Well, I'm off.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.278
But first, let me say

07:58.278 --> 08:01.147
congratulations in advance
to the lucky man

08:01.147 --> 08:03.316
who forks over a
boatload of cash

08:03.316 --> 08:06.519
for an unsurpassed evening
of intellectual ecstasy

08:06.519 --> 08:08.855
with this red-hot
Renaissance woman.

08:08.855 --> 08:10.757
I could go on...

08:10.757 --> 08:12.525
Oh, please do.
Go on.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.761
Hey, Salem.

08:14.761 --> 08:15.996
Are my aunts around?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.498
I've got a smile
and an entire cheesecake.

08:18.498 --> 08:19.599
What do you think?

08:19.599 --> 08:20.600
Well, where are they?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.369
They're at the charity auction.

08:22.369 --> 08:23.870
Now if you'll excuse me

08:23.870 --> 08:28.742
I'm about to sink my teeth into
the new Francesca Flaum novel.

08:28.742 --> 08:30.343
<i>"Ravage Me Mucho,</i>
<i>Bubeleh"?</i>

08:30.343 --> 08:33.446
Francesca's the best-selling
author in the Other Realm.

08:33.446 --> 08:36.316
Paws down, she's the queen
of passion and romance.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.984
Wow, do you think
there's a chance

08:37.984 --> 08:39.986
that she would give me
some romantic advice?

08:39.986 --> 08:41.521
About as much chance
as you getting

08:41.521 --> 08:42.756
a slice of this cheesecake.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.024
Hmm.

08:44.657 --> 08:45.892
Hey...

08:46.860 --> 08:49.896
"As the beads of
sweat multiplied

08:49.896 --> 08:51.498
"like rabid protozoa

08:51.498 --> 08:55.201
they professed
their love forever."

08:55.201 --> 08:56.669
Wow, that's beautiful.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.004
( <i>sighing</i> ):
I know.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.273
What I don't know
is who <i>you</i> are

09:00.273 --> 09:02.709
and what you're
doing in my office.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.377
You have a heart-shaped bed
in your office?

09:04.377 --> 09:05.945
A stranger and a decorator.

09:05.945 --> 09:07.480
Lovely combo.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.383
Sorry. I'm Sabrina Spellman, and
I was hoping you could help me.

09:10.383 --> 09:13.219
See, when I told my boyfriend
that my old boyfriend kissed me

09:13.219 --> 09:14.387
he barely reacted at all.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.588
A-ha!

09:15.822 --> 09:17.624
An insecure female protagonist

09:17.624 --> 09:19.859
with a disturbingly
passive paramour.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.594
Oh, my dear,
I have written

09:21.594 --> 09:23.696
your character
a thousand times.

09:23.696 --> 09:24.898
Great, I'm
a stereotype.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.366
But the character
I'm worried about

09:26.366 --> 09:27.734
is the passive paramour.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.469
I mean, if my boyfriend
really cared about me

09:29.469 --> 09:31.404
wouldn't he have had a
more passionate response?

09:31.404 --> 09:32.772
You want him more jealous?

09:32.772 --> 09:33.907
Yeah, I guess.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.642
Oh, I can do that.
What do
you mean?

09:35.642 --> 09:37.444
Oh, I have everyone's
love life on file.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.478
I'll just do

09:38.478 --> 09:41.648
a rewrite on <i>your</i> love interest.

09:41.648 --> 09:42.849
Let me see, now...

09:42.849 --> 09:44.050
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm...

09:44.050 --> 09:46.553
Oh, I'm guessing
that would be Harvey?

09:46.553 --> 09:48.154
Oh, no, no, that's
the early chapters.

09:48.154 --> 09:49.289
My boyfriend now is Josh.

09:49.289 --> 09:50.723
Oh, yes, I see that.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.026
Ooh! He has
that new rugged look.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.428
Well, I'd better
get started.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.597
I just need to fetch
my writing tool.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.566
Oh, tool!

10:01.034 --> 10:03.436
Wow, that's some laptop.

10:03.703 --> 10:06.272
And he's not even booted up.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.176
Well, that worked out.
I had Francesca

10:10.176 --> 10:12.245
rewrite Josh for me.
Next time I see him

10:12.245 --> 10:15.014
I'll get that passionate
response I've been waiting for.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.015
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

10:16.015 --> 10:17.016
Oh, that's him.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.184
( <i>gasping</i> )

10:18.184 --> 10:20.487
I can't have company
see me like <i>this.</i>

10:21.054 --> 10:22.789
Ah...

10:23.189 --> 10:24.958
Hi, Josh.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.193
Finally. I've been looking
all over town for you.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.528
You're hiding him
here, aren't you?

10:28.528 --> 10:29.529
Hiding who?

10:29.529 --> 10:30.864
That dirtbag, Derek.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.266
Tell me where he is
or I'll tear this house apart

10:33.266 --> 10:34.968
closet by closet,
drawer by drawer.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.836
Josh, Derek's not here,
and even if he was

10:36.836 --> 10:38.471
he wouldn't fit
in a drawer.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.807
A-ha! You're hiding
him in the dining
room, aren't you?

10:40.807 --> 10:42.609
I think Francesca
may have gone

10:42.609 --> 10:44.611
a little bit overboard
on the jealousy thing.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.812
Don't blame Francesca.

10:45.812 --> 10:48.281
She didn't have squat
to work with.

10:48.281 --> 10:49.415
He's upstairs, isn't he?

10:49.415 --> 10:50.783
No, look,
you're acting crazy.

10:50.783 --> 10:52.185
Well, how am I
supposed to act

10:52.185 --> 10:53.586
after hearing
about that kiss?

10:53.586 --> 10:54.954
I'm still trying
to figure that out.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.723
Listen, maybe we should
reschedule tonight.

10:56.723 --> 10:58.324
Uh, I just remembered
I have this thing

10:58.324 --> 10:59.893
I have to rewrite
as soon as possible.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.961
What thing? A love
letter to Derek?

11:01.961 --> 11:04.664
Hey! Come out of there.
I know you're in there!

11:04.664 --> 11:05.899
Okay, you know what?

11:05.899 --> 11:07.667
You need to go home
and get some rest.

11:07.667 --> 11:08.801
How am I supposed
to rest

11:08.801 --> 11:10.303
when every time
I close my eyes

11:10.303 --> 11:15.074
I see you and that sleazeball
kissing behind my back?

11:15.074 --> 11:16.242
Uh...

11:16.242 --> 11:19.012
try a little
St. John's wort.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.580
Good night.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.751
Well, I can't have
a relationship

11:24.751 --> 11:26.352
with a jealous freak.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.820
I thought you said Francesca was

11:27.820 --> 11:29.756
the greatest romance novelist
of all time.

11:29.756 --> 11:31.057
What can I say?

11:31.057 --> 11:33.826
Every now and then,
she writes a stinker.

11:38.698 --> 11:39.832
Nice technique.

11:39.832 --> 11:41.034
I've got an emergency.

11:41.034 --> 11:42.435
Where's Francesca?

11:42.435 --> 11:45.905
Off on another Julia Roberts
romantic crisis.

11:45.905 --> 11:48.341
Boy, for a pretty woman,
she sure goes through them.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.977
Well, wh-when is she
going to be back?

11:50.977 --> 11:53.279
With Julia, hard to say.

11:53.279 --> 11:54.581
Two weeks...

11:54.581 --> 11:55.615
maybe never.

11:55.882 --> 11:56.983
What?

11:57.350 --> 11:59.686
Well, you mean I might
be stuck with Josh

11:59.686 --> 12:01.154
as a jealous
lunatic forever?

12:01.421 --> 12:04.857
On the bright side,
I will have more time to work

12:04.857 --> 12:06.359
on my... biceps.

12:11.531 --> 12:12.732
This is ridiculous.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.234
I can't spend the
rest of my life

12:14.234 --> 12:16.469
with a boyfriend
who puts his fist
through walls.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.606
For one thing,
I'll lose my
security deposit.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.341
Sabrina, I would love
to help you

12:21.341 --> 12:23.042
but I am no writer.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.210
Wait a minute.

12:24.210 --> 12:25.278
I'm a writer.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.280
I mean, if I can crank out
a newspaper article

12:27.280 --> 12:29.949
at a moment's notice, I'm sure
I can rewrite a romance novel.

12:29.949 --> 12:31.951
I'm willing to do
anything I can to help.

12:31.951 --> 12:33.353
I am Fabrizio!

12:33.353 --> 12:35.922
Why are you
taking your shirt off?

12:35.922 --> 12:38.391
That is what Francesca
always has me do.

12:38.391 --> 12:39.926
But if it is distracting

12:39.926 --> 12:41.928
I will put it back on.

12:41.928 --> 12:43.263
No, no, no, no.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.498
Hey, if it's good enough
for Francesca

12:45.498 --> 12:46.899
it is good enough for me.

12:48.635 --> 12:50.603
Harvey, people are fighting
like crazy

12:50.603 --> 12:51.871
over your hockey sticks

12:51.871 --> 12:54.040
but no one has
bid on Zelda.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.276
That's because my hockey sticks
didn't brag

12:56.276 --> 12:58.544
about how brilliant
and beautiful they are.

12:58.544 --> 13:00.580
But Zelda <i>is</i> brilliant
and beautiful.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.850
I've got to be able
to squeeze some cash
out of that somehow.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.018
Yo!

13:05.018 --> 13:06.085
Check out this table.

13:06.085 --> 13:07.186
Who will be

13:07.186 --> 13:10.323
the lucky man to snap up
the most valuable prize here?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.591
Well, here comes

13:11.591 --> 13:13.159
a man who knows a good value

13:13.159 --> 13:14.294
when he sees one.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.595
You bet I do.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.830
These shortbread cookies
are worth triple the price.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.234
You chose cookies
over my sister?

13:21.234 --> 13:22.702
Well, they're
from Scotland.

13:22.702 --> 13:23.870
Oh, those are the best!

13:23.870 --> 13:24.637
Yeah.

13:25.104 --> 13:28.341
...Steeling herself
with an inner strength

13:28.341 --> 13:29.776
heretofore unknown

13:29.776 --> 13:33.813
Sabrina assures Josh
that Derek's kiss meant nothing

13:33.813 --> 13:37.317
but Josh, still fearful
that he might lose his beloved

13:37.317 --> 13:39.719
eloquently expresses
his heartfelt sensitivity

13:39.719 --> 13:40.920
to Sabrina.

13:40.920 --> 13:42.088
( <i>sniffling</i> )

13:42.088 --> 13:43.956
Wow, I moved
you to tears.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.124
Am I that good?

13:45.124 --> 13:46.426
No, it...

13:46.426 --> 13:49.662
That is what Francesca
always has me do.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.432
But if it is distracting,
I can stop.

13:52.432 --> 13:55.601
Hey, you know,
your choice.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.637
Great.

13:57.637 --> 13:58.805
There's my sensitive Josh.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.840
Now I'll finally get
that heartfelt response

14:00.840 --> 14:01.874
I've been waiting for.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.676
Oh, Sabrina, thank God
you're here!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.311
I'm ready to
lose my mind.

14:05.311 --> 14:07.480
What happened? A customer
asked you for a refill?

14:07.480 --> 14:10.016
No, it's that
boyfriend of yours.

14:10.016 --> 14:11.451
Oh, Sabrina...

14:11.451 --> 14:12.852
please don't go!

14:12.985 --> 14:16.789
I can't bear the thought
of my life without you in it.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.157
Gross!

14:18.157 --> 14:19.759
He is even more
pathetic now

14:19.759 --> 14:22.028
than when he was
dull and passionless.

14:22.028 --> 14:24.797
I know you must hate me
for acting like this

14:24.797 --> 14:26.933
for unveiling my weak side
to you.

14:26.933 --> 14:29.168
Josh, get a grip.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.169
But I'm devastated

14:30.169 --> 14:32.538
that your lips have touched
another man's!

14:32.538 --> 14:34.073
Okay, this is
definitely not

14:34.073 --> 14:35.308
what I had
in mind.

14:35.308 --> 14:37.944
I know I can be a little clingy
and needy, but I can change...

14:37.944 --> 14:41.581
Yeah, well,
the sooner
the better.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.049
Well?

14:43.049 --> 14:44.117
Take your shirt off.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.485
We've got writing to do.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.524
Harvey, the bidding
is almost over

14:51.524 --> 14:53.393
and Zelda's sheet
is still blank.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.828
This will be terrible
for her self-esteem.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.996
I don't think

14:56.996 --> 15:00.166
the "red-hot Renaissance woman"
has a self-esteem problem.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.835
Trust me, she may come
off totally confident

15:02.835 --> 15:05.304
and self-possessed, but
she'll be devastated.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.106
I've got to do
something.

15:07.106 --> 15:08.574
Please, I'm
begging you!

15:08.574 --> 15:12.545
Somebody date my
precious, wonderful,
sweet sister!

15:12.545 --> 15:15.415
Or she's going to make
my life a living hell.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.582
No way.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.117
With a pompous attitude
like Zelda's

15:18.117 --> 15:19.752
you should pay us
to go out with her.

15:19.752 --> 15:20.820
Now you're talking.

15:20.820 --> 15:23.589
Give me a grand, and I'll
tolerate her for an evening.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.324
I'll put up with
her for $950.

15:25.324 --> 15:26.859
You must be insane.

15:26.859 --> 15:27.894
You're right.

15:27.894 --> 15:30.463
I'll stay with
my hockey stick
and soap basket.

15:30.463 --> 15:33.766
You think I'd actually
pay someone to date my sister?

15:33.766 --> 15:36.936
All right, $900
and not a penny more.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

15:37.937 --> 15:39.405
Oh, there's Josh.

15:39.405 --> 15:40.139
Whoo!

15:40.573 --> 15:42.575
Okay, I worked really hard
on this rewrite.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.577
I've un-psychoed him,
I've de-wimped him.

15:44.577 --> 15:46.813
I know this is going
to be the Josh for me.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.884
All right, woman.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.120
I'm taking you
away from Derek
once and for all.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.721
Our burros are outside

15:55.721 --> 15:57.290
and we have Nazis
to hunt down.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.827
Oh, this romance writing is
a lot harder than it looks.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.962
That was quick.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.064
What was wrong with
the latest Josh?

16:05.064 --> 16:06.365
Let's just say

16:06.365 --> 16:09.602
my idea of a romantic evening is
not hunting down Klaus Barbie.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.003
FRANCESCA:
I'm back!

16:11.003 --> 16:12.004
Ooh, so are you.

16:12.004 --> 16:13.906
I thought
I finished your rewrite.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.274
Unfortunately,
it didn't work.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.576
Josh became way
too jealous.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.577
So in your
absence

16:17.577 --> 16:18.711
I did a couple
of rewrites

16:18.711 --> 16:20.179
but they were
complete disasters.

16:20.179 --> 16:22.014
Everyone's a writer.

16:22.014 --> 16:23.483
Sabrina, it sounds to me

16:23.483 --> 16:26.319
like you don't know
how you want Josh to react.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.521
So perhaps it's best
if we start over

16:28.521 --> 16:30.323
work from the original draft.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.924
An excellent idea.

16:31.924 --> 16:33.326
An excellent idea would be

16:33.326 --> 16:35.595
for you to wash
and fluff Mr. Chow.

16:35.595 --> 16:39.131
Julia Roberts just shed
all over him.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.166
Now...

16:40.399 --> 16:43.035
let me quickly reread
the problem chapter.

16:43.035 --> 16:44.504
And after I get
a sense of it

16:44.504 --> 16:46.706
then we'll figure
out our approach.

16:47.440 --> 16:51.377
( <i>incanting</i> ):
Writing romance novels
is not an easy craft.

16:51.377 --> 16:55.681
Take me back
to Sabrina's
original draft.

16:56.315 --> 16:57.483
A-ha.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.018
Aw...

17:00.486 --> 17:03.189
No wonder none of the
other rewrites worked out.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.490
What are you talking about?

17:04.490 --> 17:07.493
Sabrina, as with
any good story

17:07.493 --> 17:09.595
you need to read
between the lines.

17:09.595 --> 17:12.164
Examine the gestures,
the expressions, hmm?

17:13.533 --> 17:15.801
Derek stopped by
the coffeehouse
last night.

17:15.801 --> 17:17.103
Derek?

17:17.103 --> 17:18.704
That guy
you used to date?

17:18.704 --> 17:22.108
I see a very
emotional
reaction here.

17:22.108 --> 17:22.842
Really?

17:22.842 --> 17:24.844
The news cut like a dagger

17:24.844 --> 17:26.479
through Josh's heart.

17:26.479 --> 17:30.283
Could Sabrina's old boyfriend
Derek have rekindled

17:30.283 --> 17:31.884
the flame between them?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.019
Yeah, he's an artist now.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.987
He wanted to show me
some of his paintings.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.757
You know, they were decent--
reds, blues, that sort of thing.

17:37.757 --> 17:39.692
Anyway, before I know it,
Derek kissed me.

17:39.692 --> 17:42.194
Josh's heart started pumping
wildly.

17:42.194 --> 17:46.365
Would his one
true love leave
him sad, desperate

17:46.365 --> 17:49.035
and pining for
her for the rest

17:49.035 --> 17:50.236
of his born days?

17:50.236 --> 17:51.203
Really?

17:51.203 --> 17:52.705
Wait! You said
you'd hear me out.

17:52.705 --> 17:54.574
The kiss came out
of absolutely nowhere.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.108
I immediately
pushed him away

17:56.108 --> 17:57.510
told him
that he was out of line

17:57.510 --> 17:58.444
and that you and I are
totally together.

17:58.444 --> 17:59.712
It mean absolutely nothing.

17:59.712 --> 18:00.813
You have to
believe me.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.815
I do believe you.

18:02.815 --> 18:05.284
And Josh
<i>did</i> believe her.

18:05.284 --> 18:06.819
And he could see

18:06.819 --> 18:09.088
that Sabrina's words
<i>were</i> heartfelt.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.957
And he knew that they had built

18:10.957 --> 18:13.092
a strong bond of trust
between them.

18:13.092 --> 18:18.598
And he loved her more than ever.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.333
Wow, you know,
looking back at it

18:20.333 --> 18:22.034
Josh seems so much more...

18:22.034 --> 18:23.336
Romantic?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.872
Sabrina, the reason why none
of the other rewrites worked

18:26.872 --> 18:30.309
is because the original story
was perfect the way it was.

18:30.309 --> 18:31.477
Yeah, I guess so.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.645
Many times

18:32.645 --> 18:34.280
people mistake
jealousy

18:34.280 --> 18:36.282
and insecurity
for passion.

18:36.282 --> 18:41.887
But true love
is built on trust
and mutual respect.

18:41.887 --> 18:42.922
Thanks, Francesca.

18:42.922 --> 18:44.924
You know, for helping me
read between the lines.

18:44.924 --> 18:45.925
( <i>pager beeps</i> )

18:45.925 --> 18:46.926
Oh!

18:46.926 --> 18:48.394
That's the newspaper paging me.

18:48.394 --> 18:49.662
Well, if you ever need me

18:49.662 --> 18:51.330
to write a hard news story
for you

18:51.330 --> 18:52.598
I'm much better
with that.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.200
Oh, thank you, dear.

18:54.200 --> 18:55.368
Fabrizio!

18:56.535 --> 18:59.905
Now it's my turn
to get washed and fluffed.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.910
Hey, burning the midnight oil?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.647
Yeah, a man's
got to do what a
man's got to do.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.782
And a girl's got
to let her man do what he does

19:09.782 --> 19:12.184
because changing him will only
get her into trouble.

19:12.184 --> 19:13.619
Say that again?

19:13.619 --> 19:14.720
It's not important.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.188
Is Mike here?
I think he paged me.

19:16.188 --> 19:19.525
No, it's just you
and me and Henri.

19:19.525 --> 19:21.427
Who's Henri?

19:21.560 --> 19:23.362
I am Henri.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.031
Good evening, mademoiselle.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.533
I'll be your waiter tonight.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.334
What?

19:28.901 --> 19:30.169
What's going on?

19:30.169 --> 19:32.838
Oh, just your average
photographer boyfriend

19:32.838 --> 19:34.306
having a romantic dinner

19:34.306 --> 19:36.742
with his not-so-average
journalist girlfriend.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.310
Henri, lights, please.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.750
Wow, Josh, this
is unbelievable.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.952
No, you're unbelievable.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.588
I guess I've
always known that

19:49.588 --> 19:51.957
but for some reason
it really hit me

19:51.957 --> 19:53.993
when you told me
about that kiss.

19:53.993 --> 19:54.794
It did?

19:54.794 --> 19:56.062
Yeah, I have to admit

19:56.062 --> 19:57.997
at first,
I was a little jealous.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.533
And then I found myself
getting insecure...

20:00.533 --> 20:03.102
Yeah, let's not forget
your Nazi-hunting phase.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.103
What?

20:04.103 --> 20:05.137
Go on.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.739
Well, then I realized

20:06.739 --> 20:08.541
I had no reason
to get all crazy.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.809
And one
of the things

20:09.809 --> 20:12.912
I love most about you is
that I know I can trust you.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.947
Is this making any sense?

20:14.947 --> 20:16.248
Totally.

20:16.248 --> 20:19.218
"And she fell into his arms
bathed in the contentment

20:19.218 --> 20:22.321
that she had found the Josh
she had always dreamed of."

20:22.321 --> 20:24.857
Wow, you should write
romance novels.

20:24.857 --> 20:29.261
You know, I think
I'll just stick
with the romance.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.709
And then after I finished my
fellowship at the Sorbonne

20:43.709 --> 20:45.244
I took a brief sabbatical
at Oxford.

20:45.244 --> 20:48.013
Uh-huh. Can you pass
the steak sauce?

20:50.349 --> 20:53.586
Larry, I hate to be tacky...

20:53.586 --> 20:54.487
Uh-huh?

20:54.487 --> 20:55.688
...but what did
the bidding

20:55.688 --> 20:57.123
finally close at
for this date?

20:57.123 --> 20:58.758
Oh, 900 big ones.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.759
Really?

20:59.925 --> 21:01.761
That's an
impressive figure.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.195
I still say you got me cheap.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.131
What do you mean
<i>I</i> got <i>you</i> cheap?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.732
I should have held out
for a grand.

21:06.732 --> 21:08.267
Wait a minute.

21:08.267 --> 21:10.269
Let me understand this.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.238
You're saying
you were given money

21:12.238 --> 21:13.706
to go on a date with me?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.307
Yeah, didn't your sister
tell you?

21:15.307 --> 21:17.443
Hilda's going
to pay for this.

21:17.443 --> 21:18.611
She already did.
