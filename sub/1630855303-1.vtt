00:48.526 --> 00:51.486
[narrator] Many moons ago,

00:51.660 --> 00:56.230
when the lands of The Above
and The Below were one,

00:56.404 --> 01:00.799
a young king ruled
with a power of imagination
so great

01:00.973 --> 01:05.543
that his very thoughts
brought light and peace to all.

01:05.717 --> 01:08.720
But near the 12th year
of his reign,

01:08.894 --> 01:11.984
a great tragedy befell
the young king,

01:12.159 --> 01:15.118
and his grief so great,
split the world...[person screaming]

01:15.292 --> 01:20.558
...into the lands of The Above
and The Below,

01:20.732 --> 01:23.779
where all memory of the tragedy
was buried.

01:23.953 --> 01:27.521
And so it was
that time stood still...[clock chimes, distorted]

01:27.696 --> 01:30.307
...and a great darkness
fell across the land.

01:31.613 --> 01:34.354
And in that darkness
grew a creature

01:34.529 --> 01:37.488
made of fear itself.

01:38.359 --> 01:41.971
A creature known as the Shroud.

01:46.889 --> 01:48.717
[clock winding]

01:48.890 --> 01:50.545
[gasps, pants]

01:50.719 --> 01:53.113
Peter, ça va?
Are you okay?

01:54.418 --> 01:55.419
Yeah.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.334
Yeah.

01:59.902 --> 02:01.686
[Peter exhales]

02:08.258 --> 02:10.565
"Welcome to Wilson."

02:10.739 --> 02:12.871
This is it! This is it!
This is it!

02:21.010 --> 02:22.446
[engine turns off]

02:26.102 --> 02:27.190
Wow!

02:27.364 --> 02:28.322
Verity.

02:28.496 --> 02:29.671
Come on, Peter.

02:37.679 --> 02:40.421
I used to spend my summers here
when I was a kid.

02:40.595 --> 02:43.031
This place has everything
that we'’ve ever dreamt of.

02:43.206 --> 02:44.728
High ceilings,
period features.

02:44.903 --> 02:48.733
Peeling of paint,
rising of damp,
cracking everywhere.

02:50.605 --> 02:51.997
That'’s where
the light gets in.

02:53.390 --> 02:54.913
Come on,
let'’s go take a look.

02:55.871 --> 02:57.567
[Peter'’s mother]
Peter, ça va?

03:07.665 --> 03:09.537
[exhales]

03:13.062 --> 03:14.019
[gasping]

03:15.282 --> 03:18.415
[heartbeat thumping]

03:21.679 --> 03:22.898
[exhales]

03:54.277 --> 03:56.758
[inhales, exhales]

03:59.587 --> 04:01.589
Try and make it there
in three seconds.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.733
[speaking French]
Did you make it?

04:18.127 --> 04:19.737
Come on,
we can do this.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.177
[coughs] Mon Dieu!

04:27.615 --> 04:30.966
[sighs] How long
do we have to stay here?

04:31.140 --> 04:33.273
Oh, no, no.
We are just here to clean.

04:34.534 --> 04:36.232
Look what I found.

04:36.406 --> 04:38.582
Wow!
They'’re in here too.

04:39.366 --> 04:40.541
They'’re quite wonderful.

04:40.715 --> 04:42.499
I will keep them.

04:42.673 --> 04:44.675
Treasure, careful.
The floors look very old.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.068
[Verity] Okay, Mama.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.335
[Verity]
It has a swimming pool!

04:52.509 --> 04:53.728
[frog ribbits]

04:53.902 --> 04:55.338
Hello,
Mr. Frog Prince.

04:55.512 --> 04:56.774
I'’m the fairy queen.

04:57.732 --> 05:00.430
That'’s--
That'’s not a swimming pool.

05:00.604 --> 05:02.737
I was only talking
to the Frog Prince.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.957
There'’s no such thing
as a "frog prince."

05:08.656 --> 05:11.441
You know, I once saved
your mother from a frog prince.[chuckles]

05:11.615 --> 05:13.008
[scoffs]

05:15.445 --> 05:17.142
Ah, smell that.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.406
That'’s the smell
of inspiration.[chuckles]

05:19.580 --> 05:21.364
[doorbell rings]

05:21.538 --> 05:22.887
Who could be calling?

05:24.019 --> 05:25.890
Close your eyes.
What do you see?

05:28.110 --> 05:32.070
I see magical creatures
and a wondrous kingdom.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.985
And I am their queen.

05:34.159 --> 05:36.336
The Kingdom of Imagination
awaits you.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.555
What is thy decree,
Your Majesty?

05:39.121 --> 05:40.514
[giggles]

05:44.605 --> 05:46.302
What do you see, Peter?

05:46.476 --> 05:49.610
Come on, Pete.
Think outside the box.
What do you see?

05:50.915 --> 05:53.614
David,
there'’s a moving truck.

05:54.702 --> 05:56.356
Okay, why don'’t you
go get cleaned up?

05:56.530 --> 05:58.358
Oh, no! I'’m late
for the royal tea party!

05:58.532 --> 06:00.316
I'’m not even dressed
for it yet!

06:06.496 --> 06:07.584
[Peter'’s mother] David?

06:09.369 --> 06:12.154
Vivianne,
we lost the house.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.026
The bank foreclosed.

06:15.636 --> 06:16.637
What?

06:17.594 --> 06:19.770
[stammering]

06:19.944 --> 06:21.250
But we had time.

06:21.424 --> 06:23.295
[David] This is the change
that we really need.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.994
[heartbeat thumping][Vivianne, David
chattering]

06:26.168 --> 06:29.867
[David] It'’s only been a year,
and I'’m still dealing
with this too.

06:30.041 --> 06:31.347
[Vivianne]
All right!

06:31.521 --> 06:33.915
This family
loses too much.

06:34.089 --> 06:35.482
[walls cracking]

06:35.656 --> 06:36.961
[high-pitched ringing]

06:40.617 --> 06:43.446
[breathing heavily]

06:52.150 --> 06:53.151
[Verity]
Come on, Peter.

06:53.325 --> 06:55.415
Quickly,
we have to go.

06:57.155 --> 06:59.201
Verity, wait.
Where are you going?

07:02.639 --> 07:04.511
Verity, come back!

07:05.816 --> 07:07.427
Verity! Wait!

07:07.601 --> 07:09.864
[Verity]
I found it! The entrance
to the Land of Nowhere.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.736
Quickly, it'’s about
to close up forever.

07:13.737 --> 07:16.653
[door hinges creaking]

07:16.827 --> 07:18.176
[Peter whispers] Verity.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.440
[clocks ticking]

07:27.403 --> 07:28.448
Verity.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.841
[door hinges creaking]

07:31.755 --> 07:34.105
[clocks continue ticking]

07:37.935 --> 07:38.980
Verity.

07:40.416 --> 07:42.723
[bookshelf creaking][footsteps pattering]

07:46.814 --> 07:47.989
Verity.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.431
Verity.

07:56.084 --> 07:57.389
[sighs]

08:09.358 --> 08:10.881
Quickly.
She knows we'’re here.

08:11.055 --> 08:13.536
I smell something.

08:13.710 --> 08:16.452
[Peter whispers]
Verity, get out of there. Now.

08:16.626 --> 08:20.108
I smell children.[Verity giggles]

08:20.282 --> 08:21.675
[shopkeeper]
Come out, young lady.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.416
Let me see you
in that pretty coat.

08:24.591 --> 08:26.506
Hi, I'’m Verity,
and this is Peter.

08:26.680 --> 08:30.292
We just moved here today,
but Peter'’s not very happy
about it.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.599
Could you really smell us?

08:32.773 --> 08:34.338
Verity, come on.

08:34.991 --> 08:36.558
What do I smell like?

08:36.732 --> 08:40.955
You smell of sugar, spice
and all things nice, of course.

08:41.129 --> 08:44.480
Does Peter smell
of slime and snails?

08:44.654 --> 08:48.049
No, he smells of something else.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.399
Fear.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.011
Fear of things
he does not yet see.

08:57.449 --> 08:59.364
[artifact pulsing]

09:12.552 --> 09:14.118
That was very clumsy.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.685
No, no, it wasn'’t me.

09:15.859 --> 09:18.558
There was a rat or something
in the wall.A rat?

09:18.732 --> 09:21.561
Yes. I-- I mean, well,
there was something.

09:22.257 --> 09:23.519
I saw something.

09:24.738 --> 09:25.913
How much is it?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.527
[coins jingling]

09:33.050 --> 09:34.617
This is all I have.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.838
Just the right amount.

09:38.490 --> 09:39.883
For now.

09:40.057 --> 09:41.668
Okay. Verity, let'’s go.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.495
Don'’t forget your purchase.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.497
No, thank you.
You can keep it.

09:45.672 --> 09:46.977
No, no, no, Your Majesty.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.545
It is yours now.

09:56.204 --> 09:57.814
Smell you later.

09:57.988 --> 09:58.989
Come on, Verity.

10:07.737 --> 10:09.739
We found it. We found it.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.959
Hey, it'’s late.
Where have you been?

10:12.133 --> 10:13.830
[Verity] Well--No, no, no, no. Wait up.

10:14.004 --> 10:17.225
Wait up, Peter. Wait, come here.
I need your help with something.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.795
Okay.

10:21.969 --> 10:27.148
I want you to close your eyes
and imagine the very best think
you can.

10:27.322 --> 10:29.759
I love this game.
I'’m going to catch
the best think ever.

10:31.326 --> 10:32.370
Choose a hand.[sighs]

10:36.853 --> 10:38.159
I'’m no good at this.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.988
Come on, come on.
You used to love this game.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.990
Give it a go.
Use your imagination.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.471
I'’m sure there'’s still
some magic in there.

10:48.822 --> 10:50.475
[sighs]

10:59.049 --> 11:00.616
Have you got a think yet?

11:00.790 --> 11:01.922
I'’m thinking.

11:03.488 --> 11:04.794
Okay.

11:08.232 --> 11:09.277
Great.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.372
[bulb pops]

11:18.634 --> 11:21.681
What did you do, Peter?
You let them all out.

11:28.209 --> 11:30.298
Peter, where have you been?
Are you okay?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.649
Hold on.
I have something for you.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.176
Grandpa'’s compass.

11:39.350 --> 11:41.570
He promised this to you,
yes? [chuckles]

11:41.744 --> 11:45.052
If not for this compass,
you and I may not be here.

11:45.226 --> 11:47.402
In the first war,
this saved him many times.

11:48.838 --> 11:49.970
[chuckles]

11:51.536 --> 11:53.364
Okay, okay, no hugs.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.812
[crying]

12:32.012 --> 12:34.318
[high-pitched ringing]

12:35.319 --> 12:36.581
[gasps]

12:40.760 --> 12:41.891
Do you hear that?

12:44.328 --> 12:46.678
[rumbling]Can'’t you hear that noise?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
A funny thing
licked my ear.

12:48.376 --> 12:49.681
It'’s really sticky.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.248
Can'’t you hear that?

12:51.422 --> 12:52.946
I need the thing.

12:54.295 --> 12:56.601
Ugh, what thing?

12:56.776 --> 13:00.127
The thing you broke
in the store. I need it.[groans]

13:00.692 --> 13:01.781
Why?

13:03.608 --> 13:04.958
I'’m not supposed to say.

13:06.698 --> 13:08.265
[whispers] It'’s magic.

13:08.439 --> 13:12.879
[groans] Look, Verity,
I'’m in no mood for your games.

13:13.053 --> 13:15.098
Just go back to bed.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.931
So, can I have it?

13:22.105 --> 13:23.890
[grunts]

13:24.064 --> 13:25.717
You'’re not gonna let up,
are you?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.241
Just--

13:27.415 --> 13:30.287
If you want it so badly,
I'’ll sell it to you.

13:57.184 --> 13:58.794
[coins jingling]

14:03.233 --> 14:04.887
One penny, two penny,

14:05.061 --> 14:07.281
three penny, four penny--Verity, just stop.

14:07.455 --> 14:11.067
Give me the jar,
and I'’ll give you
the battered puzzle thing.

14:20.076 --> 14:21.861
[gasps, breathes heavily]

14:22.035 --> 14:23.036
[electricity crackling]

14:23.210 --> 14:24.733

14:26.909 --> 14:29.129
[Verity screams][Peter gasps]

14:31.479 --> 14:32.741
Peter!

14:34.047 --> 14:36.788
Peter! Jump![floorboards creaking]

Peter! Please!

14:41.576 --> 14:42.577
Peter!

Don'’t let me go!

14:47.364 --> 14:49.149
[both screaming]

14:52.717 --> 14:54.023
Verity, are you okay?

14:54.197 --> 14:55.807
Peter, I'’m scared.

14:55.982 --> 14:56.983
[Peter grunts]

14:58.593 --> 15:00.421
It'’s okay.
It'’s gonna be okay.

15:04.860 --> 15:05.905
Hold on.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.823
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.783
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.
There'’s nothing there.

15:14.957 --> 15:16.785
Peter, open your eyes.
They'’re everywhere.

15:16.959 --> 15:20.093
No, they'’re not.
There'’s nothing there.Stop saying that!

15:20.267 --> 15:23.574
We'’re gonna close our eyes,
and we'’re gonna count to three.

15:23.748 --> 15:27.578
Then we'’re gonna open our eyes,
and we'’re gonna see
there'’s nothing there.

15:27.752 --> 15:28.666
All right?

15:28.840 --> 15:31.539
[both] One, two, three.

15:34.368 --> 15:37.284
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

[pangolin whistles]

15:40.548 --> 15:41.984
[speaking pangolin language]

15:42.158 --> 15:44.639
Peter, they said
to hold on tight![Peter] What?

15:44.813 --> 15:46.684
[continues speaking
pangolin language]

15:46.858 --> 15:48.948
[Peter breathing heavily]

16:17.585 --> 16:18.978
[both scream]

16:24.200 --> 16:25.723
No. No!

[chattering continues]

17:31.398 --> 17:33.226
[speaking pangolin language]

17:33.400 --> 17:34.401
Is that so?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.751
Well, thank you.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.275
Don'’t worry, Peter.
They'’re very friendly.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.016
Who are you talking to?

17:41.190 --> 17:43.149
[speaking pangolin language]Oh, of course.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.976
He can'’t understand you yet.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.110
Peter,
you have to hold very still.

17:48.284 --> 17:51.505
You'’ll find it tickles,
but it doesn'’t hurt a bit.

17:51.679 --> 17:53.724
[Peter] What do you mean?
What are you talking about?

17:54.769 --> 17:56.336
[grunts] Oh!

17:58.207 --> 17:59.208
What was that?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.776
[in English]
Your satchel, sire.

18:01.950 --> 18:02.994
They can talk.

18:03.734 --> 18:04.953
They can talk.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.476
[Verity]
Well, of course they can.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.782
Um...

18:12.047 --> 18:13.570
[stammering] Huh...

18:15.311 --> 18:17.226
What is the meaning of this?

18:17.400 --> 18:20.360
General Rumph,
we are victorious.

18:20.534 --> 18:22.231
We have saved the king.

18:22.405 --> 18:23.624
And just in time.

18:23.798 --> 18:25.800
You fools!

18:25.974 --> 18:28.107
You'’ve risked our position
for nothing.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.196
This is just a child.

18:30.370 --> 18:35.549
[pangolin leader]
Our king shall not
be judged by his years,

18:35.723 --> 18:38.726
but by his deeds.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.380
He looks most important.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.730
Look, Verity,
I'’ll do the talking.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.427
Why?

18:44.601 --> 18:46.777
Because I'’m the oldest,
and that'’s the rule.

18:46.951 --> 18:48.344
That is not a rule.

18:48.518 --> 18:50.477
You just made that up.

18:50.651 --> 18:53.654
These guards
have deliberately
broken protocol.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.526
We now risk a direct attack
from the Shroud.

18:56.700 --> 19:01.879
Protocol does not
trump prophecy, my dear general.

19:02.053 --> 19:06.057
Respectfully,
the pangolin have lost too many
to this prophecy of yours.

19:07.189 --> 19:11.062
And many more shall be lost,

19:11.237 --> 19:13.891
should the prophecy
not prevail.

19:15.850 --> 19:21.725
I have waited for this day
a long time.

19:21.899 --> 19:25.381
A long, long time.

19:27.514 --> 19:30.256
Welcome, Your Majesty.

19:30.430 --> 19:31.822
Why, thank you.

19:31.996 --> 19:34.390
I'’m Verity,
and this is Peter.[Peter] Shh.

19:34.564 --> 19:37.001
Who are you, and why have
you brought us here?

19:37.176 --> 19:40.788
My apologies, Your Majesty.

19:40.962 --> 19:45.836
I am Elwyn,
leader of the pangolin.

19:46.010 --> 19:48.099
Keepers of the prophecy.

19:48.274 --> 19:53.104
Your arrival was foretold
many moons ago.

19:53.279 --> 19:56.891
I'’m sorry, but I think
you'’ve mistaken me
for someone else.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.067
[Elwyn] You are Peter.

20:00.460 --> 20:04.812
You are to reunite
our two great lands

20:04.986 --> 20:07.945
and restore light
and peace to The Below.

20:08.119 --> 20:09.904
No, but that can'’t
possibly be me.

20:10.078 --> 20:11.471
I just moved here today.

20:11.645 --> 20:17.564
You carry with you an object
of great, great power.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.002
A golden piece

20:21.176 --> 20:24.571
inscribed with the language
of prophecy.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.445
You mean-- You mean this?

20:29.619 --> 20:32.405
[pangolins chattering,
clamoring]

20:32.579 --> 20:35.234
Behold your king.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.366
[pangolins exclaiming]

20:43.198 --> 20:46.332
No, no. Everyone,
everyone, this is just
a big misunderstanding.

20:46.506 --> 20:47.898
I'’m not a king.

20:50.466 --> 20:53.208
[pangolins continue exclaiming]

20:53.382 --> 20:56.777
My brothers and sisters,

20:56.951 --> 21:00.389
on this great, great day,

21:00.563 --> 21:04.915
the prophecy
has delivered unto us

21:05.089 --> 21:07.440
our promised king.

21:08.354 --> 21:10.486
Come, Your Majesty.

21:10.660 --> 21:12.706
There is much for you to see.

21:13.968 --> 21:15.491
No, Verity, wait.

21:15.665 --> 21:18.189
Come on, Peter. We mustn'’t
keep them waiting.

21:18.799 --> 21:20.148
No. [sighs]

21:27.503 --> 21:30.854
I'’m sorry, but we don'’t
belong here, and we really
have to get back home.

21:31.028 --> 21:32.769
But I don'’t wanna
go home yet.

21:32.943 --> 21:36.556
The portal to The Above
has been closed

21:36.730 --> 21:38.297
for your protection.

21:39.123 --> 21:41.256
The way back is shut.

21:41.430 --> 21:43.693
But do not fear, young Peter.

21:43.867 --> 21:46.305
Your path ahead
is quite clear.

21:46.479 --> 21:48.045
Your Majesty.

21:48.219 --> 21:49.133
Your Majesty.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.787
Your Majesty.

21:50.961 --> 21:54.356
Oh, I just love your dress.
[chuckles]

21:55.618 --> 21:57.185
Ooh, Your Majesty.

21:57.359 --> 22:00.144
Hello. It'’s lovely
to meet you all.

22:01.668 --> 22:02.756
Pling.

22:03.887 --> 22:04.932
Yes, sir.

22:05.628 --> 22:06.934
You'’re late.

22:07.717 --> 22:10.198
Um, yes, Uncle.

22:11.982 --> 22:14.333
I-I mean, sir.

22:14.985 --> 22:16.117
Sorry. [stammers]

22:16.291 --> 22:17.727
It won'’t happen again.

22:17.901 --> 22:19.294
What did I miss?

22:22.689 --> 22:25.169
The compass! It'’s him!

22:26.519 --> 22:28.434
I mean, you.

22:29.130 --> 22:30.566
You'’re here.

22:30.740 --> 22:32.002
You'’re really here.

22:33.308 --> 22:34.222
Oh-Oh, my.

22:34.396 --> 22:39.183
I-- I mean, Your Majesty.

22:39.358 --> 22:45.276
Pling, fetch the sacred book
and join us in the cave.

22:46.843 --> 22:48.410
Um, yes.

22:48.584 --> 22:49.542
Of course, Uncle.

22:49.716 --> 22:52.196
I-I mean, Master Elwyn.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.679
It'’s really you!Now, Pling.

22:56.853 --> 22:58.072
Of course, Uncle.

22:58.638 --> 22:59.943
Wow!

23:00.117 --> 23:01.641
[Verity giggles]

23:01.815 --> 23:03.947
Pling.Oh. Uh...

23:15.176 --> 23:18.092
Behold the prophecy.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.444
[Verity] Wow!

23:22.618 --> 23:24.707
It'’s a bird.[bird chirping]

23:24.881 --> 23:26.579
And a dragon.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.059
Oh, wait, there, look!

23:29.233 --> 23:31.148
A unicorn!

23:31.322 --> 23:37.067
This part of the prophecy
tells of the time before.

23:37.241 --> 23:42.159
The time when the lands
of The Above and The Below
were one.

23:43.073 --> 23:46.337
A time before the Shroud.

23:47.600 --> 23:51.691
Um, I mean no disrespect,
but why are we here?

23:51.865 --> 23:53.867
That looks like me
in my pretty nightdress.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.259
That'’s my necklace.

23:55.434 --> 23:57.914
It can'’t be.
That'’s impossible.

23:58.088 --> 24:02.615
This is the foretelling
of your arrival.

24:03.790 --> 24:07.097
"A golden piece
from deepest cave.

24:07.271 --> 24:11.972
A chosen king,
both fair and brave,

24:12.146 --> 24:15.454
whom guardians from below
will save.

24:16.933 --> 24:21.111
Pieces five, a king will find

24:21.285 --> 24:23.679
and in the Citadel will bind

24:23.853 --> 24:28.684
to defeat the Shroud
and reset time."

24:30.164 --> 24:31.295
What does it mean?

24:32.427 --> 24:35.430
It speaks of the great clock
of the Citadel

24:35.604 --> 24:39.434
that has the power
to bring the light
back to The Below.

24:39.608 --> 24:41.871
[rumbling]

24:42.829 --> 24:44.134
[Verity] What was that?

24:45.048 --> 24:47.311
[Rumph]
The Shroud has found us.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.009
I warned you.

24:49.183 --> 24:50.880
Hold your ground.

24:51.054 --> 24:53.622
Assemble a troop
and prepare for safe passage.

24:53.796 --> 24:55.668
The king must not be harmed.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.845
If he is the king,
let him face it.

24:59.019 --> 25:01.325
He is not yet ready.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.067
[Rumph grunts]

25:04.241 --> 25:06.156
What'’s a shroud?

25:06.330 --> 25:12.336
The Shroud is a creature
said to be made of fear itself.

25:12.511 --> 25:16.732
It is indeed
the nemesis of the king.

25:18.473 --> 25:23.260
When we heard
it had bridged the boundary
between our two worlds,

25:23.434 --> 25:25.611
we knew it would come for you.

25:26.742 --> 25:29.005
We knew it was time.

25:30.267 --> 25:32.661
That is why
we have brought you here.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.708
Why does it
want Peter?

25:35.882 --> 25:39.407
It fears but one thing:

25:40.626 --> 25:43.933
the power of the king.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.762
I-I'’m sorry. I can'’t
possibly be your king.

25:46.936 --> 25:49.460
I don'’t have any power.
I don'’t belong here.

25:49.635 --> 25:54.117
You are everything
the prophecy promised.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.598
Your path ahead is clear.

25:57.512 --> 26:00.950
You must find
the missing pieces

26:01.124 --> 26:04.432
and take them to the great clock
of the Citadel.

26:05.564 --> 26:09.176
But I'’m not brave
or powerful or anything.

26:09.350 --> 26:12.483
All you need is within you.

26:14.398 --> 26:17.140
[Peter] But what if--
What if you'’re wrong?

26:17.314 --> 26:19.795
Then all shall be lost.

26:20.535 --> 26:23.277
All will be forgotten.

26:23.451 --> 26:26.019
[Pling breathing heavily]

26:26.193 --> 26:27.977
I'’m here.

26:28.151 --> 26:32.199
Sorry, Master.
I thought I'’d put it
under "P" for "prophecy,"

26:32.373 --> 26:33.983
but it was somewhere else.

26:34.157 --> 26:39.249
Amongst these pages
are the five lost songs
of prophecy.

26:39.423 --> 26:43.689
Each one reveals the location
of a piece of the great clock.

26:45.473 --> 26:47.127
There'’s--
There'’s nothing in here.

26:47.301 --> 26:49.564
The songs are hidden.

26:49.738 --> 26:51.653
Hidden from the Shroud.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.960
You will go to the Luminere.

26:54.961 --> 26:57.093
He will teach you
to see them.

[Pling stammers]

27:16.243 --> 27:17.897

27:18.071 --> 27:20.073
You must go through
the stronghold.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.031
The Shroud'’s minions
are everywhere.

27:22.205 --> 27:24.555
You will take them
to the Luminere.

27:24.730 --> 27:26.079
It is foretold.

27:26.253 --> 27:28.559
These are my orders.

[Rumph groans]

27:36.916 --> 27:39.309
Trust no one.

27:39.483 --> 27:42.312
The Shroud has many forms

27:42.486 --> 27:45.141
and many under its control.

27:45.315 --> 27:49.842
The Luminere will help you
to see all that you must see.

27:54.934 --> 27:56.936
Hurry. You must leave now.

27:58.720 --> 28:01.157
Pling,
you will go with them.

31:12.392 --> 31:15.264
What I mean, Your Majesty,

31:15.438 --> 31:19.442
is that this was foretold.

31:19.616 --> 31:23.751
Being attacked
and almost falling off a cliff
was foretold?

31:23.925 --> 31:26.101
Y-- Yes, Your Majesty.

31:26.710 --> 31:27.755
Look!

31:29.148 --> 31:33.630
"A king with kin,
who fell from height,

31:33.804 --> 31:38.374
with path below,
all bathed in light,

31:38.548 --> 31:41.508
saw a city
on the edge of night."

31:41.682 --> 31:43.379
That'’s a bit clever.

31:43.553 --> 31:46.252
How did the prophecy know
we were gonna fall exactly here?

31:46.426 --> 31:48.950
That'’s what a prophecy does.

31:49.124 --> 31:51.518
It tells of things
before they happen.

31:51.692 --> 31:55.739
That'’s how we knew
you and King Peter would come.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.393
Pling, please.

31:57.567 --> 31:59.178
Enough
with the prophecy talk.

31:59.352 --> 32:02.224
I'’m not a king. Okay?Uh...

32:02.398 --> 32:05.880
He just gets like that sometimes
when he doesn'’t know what to do.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.448
But don'’t worry, Mr. Pling.
I'’ve caught a think.

32:08.622 --> 32:11.842
A "think," Miss Verity?

32:12.017 --> 32:13.888
Yes.
And a very good think too.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.760
You see,
Peter does not know
how to be king

32:16.935 --> 32:18.458
because he'’s afraid
of everything.

32:18.632 --> 32:20.634
So I think
that I shall be king.

32:20.808 --> 32:22.941
Well, queen, actually.

32:23.115 --> 32:25.595
I'’ve had a lot
of princessing experience.

32:26.248 --> 32:27.641
Oh...

32:27.815 --> 32:31.036
I'’ve been a fairy princess,
a forest princess,

32:31.210 --> 32:32.515
princess of whales.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.561
Well, dolphins, actually.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.172
I think I'’m the perfect person
for the job.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.133
I'’m sorry, Miss Verity,

32:41.307 --> 32:46.660
but I'’m afraid one cannot merely
declare themselves royalty--

32:46.834 --> 32:48.314
Well, that'’s very silly.

32:48.488 --> 32:49.489
Why not?

32:50.055 --> 32:51.230
Pling.

32:52.144 --> 32:53.275
Sire?

32:53.449 --> 32:55.582
Do you know how to get
to the Luminere?

32:55.756 --> 32:57.888
Yes. Yes, of course.

32:58.063 --> 33:00.413

to all the places.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.071
Even the secret ones.

33:06.245 --> 33:09.204
I could possibly
triangulate our location

33:09.378 --> 33:11.772
and find the appropriate verse
to start from.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.687

58:50.396 --> 58:51.571
What does it mean?

58:51.745 --> 58:53.704
Well,
I'’m not quite sure.

58:53.878 --> 58:55.357
We haven'’t got time
for this.

58:55.532 --> 58:58.273
Oh, I do apologize for him,
Your Majesty.

58:58.447 --> 59:00.885
I see you are vexed.Never fear, sire.

59:01.059 --> 59:03.409
I'’m working
on the subtext.

59:03.583 --> 59:07.108
Peter, you are being very rude.
They just want to help.

59:07.282 --> 59:08.762
Well, they'’re not.

59:08.936 --> 59:10.764
And I'’m sorry,
but we'’re running out of time,

59:10.938 --> 59:12.984
and we need to find
the next puzzle piece.

59:13.158 --> 59:14.594
This is hopeless.

59:14.768 --> 59:16.422
You'’re being like you used to.

59:16.596 --> 59:18.380
I thought you were going
to be brave.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.122
Why would you think that?
I'’m not brave.

59:21.296 --> 59:24.561
You go around telling everyone
how afraid of everything I am.

59:24.735 --> 59:28.260
And I am. I agree.
I'’m terrified.

59:28.434 --> 59:30.610
Just because you'’re scared
doesn'’t mean you'’re not brave.

59:30.784 --> 59:34.005
Look at all those things
you'’ve done, even though
you were scared.

59:34.179 --> 59:37.530
What did I do, Verity?
Tell me, what did I do?

59:37.704 --> 59:40.751
You came in after me
when your bed fell
into The Below.

59:40.925 --> 59:44.058
You jumped in when that thing
attacked us in the cave

59:44.232 --> 59:46.495
and I went down
the slippery slide.

59:46.670 --> 59:49.716
And you saved me
when Mendax was being all scary,

59:49.890 --> 59:52.414
even though
there were cracks everywhere.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.329
That'’s why you'’re being brave.

59:54.503 --> 59:57.637
You did all those things
even though you were scared.

59:59.639 --> 01:00:02.076
Now, everyone gets scared,

01:00:02.250 --> 01:00:04.383
but not everyone
does brave things.

01:00:08.430 --> 01:00:09.693
[sighs]

01:00:11.695 --> 01:00:13.392
What should we do, sire?

01:00:15.786 --> 01:00:17.439
I don'’t know.

01:00:17.614 --> 01:00:21.705
I'’m going outside
to make Mendax
into a proper unicorn.

01:00:22.923 --> 01:00:25.578
Do you think the unicorn
was a metaphor?

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:28.494
Her context seemed
quite literal.

01:00:31.018 --> 01:00:32.193
Wait.

01:00:32.367 --> 01:00:33.542
Two winged beasts.

01:00:33.717 --> 01:00:36.502
Oh! Yes. Griffins.

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:39.897
Are those the winged beasts
you spoke of?

01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.900
I suppose they could be.

01:00:43.074 --> 01:00:45.859
Indeed, they should be.

01:00:46.033 --> 01:00:47.861
Pling, what do the symbols
underneath read?

01:00:48.035 --> 01:00:49.863
I'’m not sure.

01:00:50.037 --> 01:00:53.127
I'’ve never seen symbols
like this before.

01:00:53.301 --> 01:00:55.260
Tell me the clue again.

01:00:55.434 --> 01:00:58.829
In temple deep, on sea of night,

01:00:59.003 --> 01:01:01.440

01:01:09.448 --> 01:01:12.756
"Gazed upon with distant sight."

01:01:12.930 --> 01:01:14.845
Distant sight.
What am I missing?

01:01:15.019 --> 01:01:19.676
Uh, the chamber is quite small.

01:01:19.850 --> 01:01:23.897
I don'’t see how it is possible
to see these from a distance.

01:01:28.554 --> 01:01:31.252
[chuckles]
That'’s it! Distant sight.

01:01:31.426 --> 01:01:34.255
Pling, relax your eyes
and look up at the wall.

01:01:34.429 --> 01:01:37.476
Look beyond the griffins.

01:01:37.650 --> 01:01:38.695
Do you see it?

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:42.481
Oh, I see. Yes.

01:01:42.655 --> 01:01:44.222

of this great battle, sire.

and get to the Citadel.

We need to take her to someone.

01:12:57.503 --> 01:13:01.812
Oh, well, in the prophecy,

01:13:01.986 --> 01:13:06.730
the king makes it all the way
to the Citadel. [chuckles]

01:13:06.904 --> 01:13:09.733
Then there'’s nothing
to be afraid of, right?

01:13:09.907 --> 01:13:12.475
Mmm... Uh...

01:13:13.344 --> 01:13:14.781
Um...

01:13:14.955 --> 01:13:16.522
Well... [chuckles]

01:13:16.696 --> 01:13:19.351
...it'’s just that
many of the events

01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:21.571
that have occurred
on our journey

01:13:21.745 --> 01:13:24.617
are not in the prophecy.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.315
Wait, so what do you mean?

01:13:27.490 --> 01:13:30.406
The-- The book
and the pieces and...

01:13:30.580 --> 01:13:34.888
Wait, if this isn'’t part
of the prophecy,

01:13:35.062 --> 01:13:38.370
then that means
I'’m not the chosen king.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.416
I knew it!

01:13:41.286 --> 01:13:42.766
I knew it.

01:13:42.940 --> 01:13:45.638
I mean, then
why are you still here?
I mean, why?

01:13:45.812 --> 01:13:47.771
Why are you here with me,

01:13:47.945 --> 01:13:49.512
risking your life,

01:13:49.686 --> 01:13:52.514
when you know
that I'’m not the king?

01:13:55.996 --> 01:14:01.262
Because you are my friend,
and...

01:14:02.307 --> 01:14:04.135
and I believe in you.

01:14:09.139 --> 01:14:11.055
Hmm.

01:14:11.228 --> 01:14:13.971
There are two possible
combinations left.

01:14:14.145 --> 01:14:15.233
You can do this.

01:14:22.893 --> 01:14:25.025
[clock continues ticking]

01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:27.637
[heartbeat thumping]

01:14:29.202 --> 01:14:31.031
Oh, please, please, please.

01:14:41.999 --> 01:14:43.478
Yes!

01:14:44.218 --> 01:14:46.046
Yes, yes!

01:14:46.219 --> 01:14:47.526
Yes! We did it!

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.702
[Pling] You did it, Peter.

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.450
[Pling] Oh...

01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:06.197
How did you do?

01:15:06.371 --> 01:15:07.546
It wasn'’t there.

01:15:08.808 --> 01:15:11.550
Is it possible
you may have missed it?

01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:14.074
What are you doing?

01:15:14.248 --> 01:15:15.554
Back up, you oaf.

01:15:16.120 --> 01:15:17.600
Mendax, move now.

01:15:19.906 --> 01:15:20.907
Very well.

01:15:32.615 --> 01:15:33.702
[Verity, softly] Peter.

01:15:33.877 --> 01:15:36.009
Verity.
Verity, I'’m here.

01:15:37.054 --> 01:15:38.882
You have to see now.

01:15:39.056 --> 01:15:41.275
Peter, you have to see.

01:15:41.449 --> 01:15:43.974
See?
What do I have to see?

01:15:47.368 --> 01:15:49.240
Verity!

01:15:49.414 --> 01:15:50.415
Verity!

01:15:50.589 --> 01:15:52.156
[high-pitched ringing][gasps]

01:15:54.550 --> 01:15:55.550
Verity!

01:15:56.594 --> 01:15:57.596
Verity!

01:15:58.162 --> 01:15:59.206
No!

01:16:18.398 --> 01:16:20.532
[thunder rumbling]

01:16:24.710 --> 01:16:28.627
A king, he stands
with trouble on high,

01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:31.151
with heavy heart
and teary eye,

01:16:31.325 --> 01:16:35.416
but to save the truth,
he again must fly.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.463
Stop it.
Read your audience.

01:16:38.637 --> 01:16:40.552
This is no time
for your dramatics.

01:16:40.726 --> 01:16:42.728
It'’s the requiem,

01:16:42.902 --> 01:16:45.992
my favorite
of all the prophetic prose.

01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:48.952
The next part
is really rather lovely.

01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:50.996
Cathartic, actually.

01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:52.782
Oh, yes! Oh!

01:16:52.956 --> 01:16:53.957
That'’s right!

01:16:54.130 --> 01:16:55.827
I remember now.

01:16:56.002 --> 01:16:58.526
This is the part
where he throws the book.

01:16:58.701 --> 01:16:59.832
Exactly.

01:17:02.182 --> 01:17:03.096
The book!The book!

01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:04.620
Your Majesty!Your Majesty!

01:17:04.794 --> 01:17:06.360
Your Majesty!Your Majesty!

01:17:11.061 --> 01:17:12.540
[Ego gasps]

01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:15.934
Oh. Oh, no.

01:17:17.371 --> 01:17:19.764
[Ergo] A beautiful moment.

01:17:19.939 --> 01:17:23.116
The death of certainty.

01:17:23.290 --> 01:17:26.684
And at the same time,
rebirth.

01:17:26.859 --> 01:17:29.601
Oh! Hurry.
We must tell him the rest.

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.124
The rest of what?

01:17:31.298 --> 01:17:32.735
[Ego] Don'’t go that way.
It'’s too high.

01:17:32.909 --> 01:17:34.562
[Ergo] This way'’s quicker.[Ego] Ow!

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:35.651
[Ergo] Oh, my!

01:17:35.825 --> 01:17:37.782
[Ego, Ergo grunting]

01:17:40.264 --> 01:17:42.483
I think
we broke something.

01:17:42.657 --> 01:17:43.571
We?

01:17:43.746 --> 01:17:45.835
You!
You broke something.

01:17:46.009 --> 01:17:48.359
[groans] Get your hand
out of my face.

01:17:48.532 --> 01:17:49.577
You okay?

01:17:51.754 --> 01:17:53.233
The missing piece.

01:17:55.148 --> 01:17:56.628
Ah![snaps fingers]

01:17:56.802 --> 01:17:57.889
That'’s where we put it.

01:17:58.064 --> 01:17:59.805
Oh...You had it all along?

01:17:59.978 --> 01:18:02.503
I'’m sorry, Your Majesty.

01:18:02.678 --> 01:18:04.375
That'’s what
I was trying to recall.

01:18:04.549 --> 01:18:07.552
I didn'’t know
it was there at all.

01:18:07.726 --> 01:18:09.119
[sighs]

01:18:19.389 --> 01:18:21.958
[screaming]

01:18:22.132 --> 01:18:25.612
[echoing]

01:18:31.794 --> 01:18:33.883
[crying]

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:47.157
You seem to have dropped this,
Your Majesty.

01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:59.559
The final part.

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.782
[Peter] "In the Citadel awaits,

01:19:03.956 --> 01:19:06.437
a final test, a shrouded fate,

01:19:07.568 --> 01:19:10.309
only the face of truth within."

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:14.793
What is it, Peter?

01:19:16.882 --> 01:19:19.450
"Only the face of truth within

01:19:20.364 --> 01:19:22.279
can release a fallen king.

01:19:22.452 --> 01:19:25.237
In the presence of the clock,

01:19:25.412 --> 01:19:27.501
puzzle complete will unlock,

01:19:27.675 --> 01:19:30.200
but only in a king'’s domain,

01:19:30.374 --> 01:19:33.202
shall the key within be gained.

01:19:33.377 --> 01:19:36.206
With tiny key and bravest heart,

01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:38.861
time when wound again
will start."

01:19:39.035 --> 01:19:40.645
[Pling] Oh...

01:19:40.818 --> 01:19:43.996
The prophecy says
that when the great clock
is restored,

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.389
the fallen will be released.

01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:47.957
[sighs]

01:19:48.130 --> 01:19:51.482
Mendax,
we'’re going to the Citadel.

01:19:51.656 --> 01:19:53.440
Very well, Your Majesty.

01:19:53.614 --> 01:19:55.486
We shall stay
and watch over her.

01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.794
Besides,
we'’re not really dressed
for the Citadel.

01:20:32.478 --> 01:20:34.612
Where to now?

01:20:34.786 --> 01:20:37.005
We are
in the Treasury Square.

01:20:37.180 --> 01:20:39.660
The tower is located
just ahead.

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.925
Yes.
Yes, that is correct.

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:46.798
It was here
that the great battle
for The Below was fought.

01:20:47.886 --> 01:20:51.063
You seem to know a lot
about this place.

01:20:51.237 --> 01:20:53.978
Oh, I'’ve heard the stories.

01:20:54.153 --> 01:20:57.678
Your kinfolk
fought most gallantly,
young Pling.

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:02.945
Although, in the end,
their sacrifice
was rather... unnecessary.

01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:04.903
The gauntlet![Mendax] Indeed.

01:21:05.077 --> 01:21:07.210
The gauntlet?
What gauntlet?

01:21:07.384 --> 01:21:10.691
Armored sentinels
that guard the tower.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.389
They are impenetrable.

01:21:12.563 --> 01:21:15.696
And you wait until now
to tell me this?

01:21:16.567 --> 01:21:19.264
I only just remembered.

01:21:20.527 --> 01:21:24.791
Not even the Shroud himself
was able to defeat them.

01:21:24.967 --> 01:21:28.666
Only a true king
will be permitted to pass.

01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.059
[Peter] Then this is about
to be over real quick.

01:21:31.234 --> 01:21:32.583
[Mendax]
Come, Your Majesty.

01:21:32.757 --> 01:21:34.454
We'’ve made it this far.

01:21:57.216 --> 01:21:58.870
[whimpering]

01:22:00.089 --> 01:22:01.873
Halt!

01:22:05.702 --> 01:22:08.271
Who goes there?

01:22:09.011 --> 01:22:10.142
[Mendax] My lords,

01:22:11.230 --> 01:22:16.148
I present to you Peter,
King of The Below.

01:22:18.193 --> 01:22:19.325
Eyes.

01:22:21.110 --> 01:22:23.634
Hmm... Interesting.

01:22:23.808 --> 01:22:25.201
What is it?

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.811
I believe it'’s a child.

01:22:26.985 --> 01:22:28.508
A mild what?

01:22:28.682 --> 01:22:30.380
No, I said a child.

01:22:30.554 --> 01:22:31.816
I am Peter.

01:22:31.990 --> 01:22:32.904
Ears.

01:22:33.077 --> 01:22:35.210
Yes, sir. Here, sir.

01:22:35.385 --> 01:22:36.864
What is he saying?

01:22:37.039 --> 01:22:39.563
It'’s a child, sir.

01:22:39.737 --> 01:22:41.695
I said, I am Peter.

01:22:41.869 --> 01:22:44.219
I have come to--A child, you say?

01:22:45.047 --> 01:22:46.264
We'’re running out of time.

01:22:46.439 --> 01:22:48.485
I command you to let us pass.

01:22:48.659 --> 01:22:51.009
[gauntlets laughing]

01:22:51.183 --> 01:22:53.272
Let us through, you oafs.

01:22:54.186 --> 01:22:56.406
Oh! Shh, shh, shh.

01:22:56.580 --> 01:22:57.710
[gauntlet leader]
Forgive us.

01:22:57.885 --> 01:23:00.323
What was that last part again?

01:23:00.496 --> 01:23:02.803
I-- I command you
to let us pass.

01:23:02.978 --> 01:23:04.457
[gauntlets laughing]

01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:07.199
Oh, he'’s thrown down
the gauntlet.

01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:08.853
You gotta
hand it to him.

01:23:09.027 --> 01:23:10.637
He must have
some big hands.

01:23:10.811 --> 01:23:12.291
You know what they say--

01:23:12.465 --> 01:23:14.598
Big hands, big glass.Big glass.

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:16.773
[gauntlets laugh]

01:23:16.948 --> 01:23:18.950
The prophecy must be fulfilled.

01:23:19.124 --> 01:23:20.125
Mendax.

01:23:20.299 --> 01:23:22.171
That beast
has no power here.

01:23:22.344 --> 01:23:23.781
[growls]

01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:26.218
Get ahold of yourselves.
You are in the presence of--

01:23:26.392 --> 01:23:28.742
Only the king shall pass.

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:31.180
Well, I am that king.

01:23:31.353 --> 01:23:32.442
[ears] Boss...

01:23:32.616 --> 01:23:34.618
[gauntlets whispering]

01:23:36.794 --> 01:23:41.973
A false claim of kinghood
is punishable by death.

01:23:47.239 --> 01:23:50.808
If you are the king,
you will prove your power,

01:23:50.982 --> 01:23:53.767
or you will be destroyed.

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:56.770
[growls]

01:23:56.943 --> 01:23:59.077
Well, how do I prove my power?

01:23:59.251 --> 01:24:01.427
A king does not ask how.

01:24:01.601 --> 01:24:03.255
Oh...

01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:04.603
[Peter] Then I--

01:24:04.778 --> 01:24:07.693
I-- I challenge you to a game.

01:24:08.608 --> 01:24:11.742
[grunts]What sort of game?

01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:14.614
A game of...

01:24:15.876 --> 01:24:16.790
Oh...

01:24:16.964 --> 01:24:18.879
...rock, paper, scissors.

01:24:20.838 --> 01:24:24.059
Challenge accepted.

01:24:26.496 --> 01:24:27.540
Oh.

01:24:27.714 --> 01:24:29.368
Three rounds.

01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.501
Best of three.

01:24:31.675 --> 01:24:35.374
If you win, you shall pass.

01:24:35.548 --> 01:24:39.465
If you do not, you shall perish.

01:24:39.639 --> 01:24:41.293
Okay. We throw on three.

01:24:41.467 --> 01:24:43.425
Acceptable.

01:24:45.818 --> 01:24:46.864
[Peter] One.

01:24:48.039 --> 01:24:49.084
Two.

01:24:49.867 --> 01:24:51.041
Three.

01:24:51.912 --> 01:24:53.827
He'’s gone scissors.

01:24:54.001 --> 01:24:55.264
We saw that one coming.

01:24:55.438 --> 01:24:58.005
Blind Freddy
could see that one coming.

01:24:58.180 --> 01:24:59.094
No, I couldn'’t.

01:24:59.268 --> 01:25:01.531
That is one point,
us.

01:25:01.705 --> 01:25:03.141
Oh...

01:25:05.796 --> 01:25:07.058
One.

01:25:08.277 --> 01:25:09.278
Two.

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:12.368
Three.

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:16.285
That is two points, us.But scissors beats paper.

01:25:16.459 --> 01:25:18.243
Two points, us.

01:25:18.416 --> 01:25:21.855
That'’s cheating.All decisions are final.

01:25:23.205 --> 01:25:26.251
You have one turn left.

01:25:26.425 --> 01:25:28.253
[growling]

01:25:28.427 --> 01:25:31.648
Maybe don'’t go scissors again.

01:25:32.692 --> 01:25:33.824
[Peter] One.

01:25:35.260 --> 01:25:36.522
[sighs]

01:25:37.827 --> 01:25:39.612
Hurry up, child.

01:25:43.268 --> 01:25:44.965
Stop stalling.

01:25:46.184 --> 01:25:47.620
[sighs]

01:25:47.794 --> 01:25:49.056
One.

01:25:51.102 --> 01:25:52.147
Two.

01:25:54.236 --> 01:25:55.237
Three.

01:25:56.455 --> 01:25:57.891
What is that?

01:25:58.065 --> 01:25:59.241
[Peter]
It'’s dynamite.

01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:00.503
[gauntlet] Dynamite?He'’s cheating.

01:26:00.677 --> 01:26:01.764
Fall in.

01:26:03.897 --> 01:26:05.072
Attack.

01:26:21.175 --> 01:26:22.829
[Pling] Oh, my goodness.

01:26:46.897 --> 01:26:48.246
[sighs]

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:50.987
"In the presence of a clock,

01:26:51.162 --> 01:26:53.382
puzzle complete will unlock,

01:26:53.556 --> 01:26:55.645
but only in a king'’s domain,

01:26:55.818 --> 01:26:58.082
shall the key within be gained.

01:26:58.255 --> 01:27:00.215
With tiny key and bravest heart,

01:27:00.389 --> 01:27:03.740
time when wound again
will start."

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:11.226
[growling quietly]

01:27:23.673 --> 01:27:25.022
Almost there.

01:27:31.681 --> 01:27:33.900
I-I don'’t understand.

01:27:37.425 --> 01:27:38.775
Why isn'’t it working?

01:27:42.387 --> 01:27:43.910
You'’ve come this far, Peter.

01:27:44.084 --> 01:27:47.349
Maybe-- Maybe I just have
to think outside the box.

01:27:47.523 --> 01:27:50.177
There'’s
that peculiar saying again.

01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:53.005
I'’m still not sure
I understand it.

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:56.575
It means to
see something differently,

01:27:56.749 --> 01:27:58.577
to find a new solution.

01:28:02.059 --> 01:28:05.148
Uh, Pling, do you know
what a king'’s domain is?

01:28:05.323 --> 01:28:09.066
Uh, I'’m not sure
I understand the question.

01:28:09.240 --> 01:28:10.937
A king'’s domain...

01:28:14.157 --> 01:28:15.072
is a castle.

01:28:15.246 --> 01:28:16.291
[puzzle clicks]

01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:17.987
[Pling] Oh, my!

01:28:18.162 --> 01:28:19.728
[chuckles]

01:28:25.735 --> 01:28:29.869
[chuckles] That is how
you think outside the box.

01:28:30.434 --> 01:28:31.523
[chuckles]

01:28:37.312 --> 01:28:39.096
Pling-- [gasps]

01:28:39.270 --> 01:28:40.967
[Peter breathing heavily]

01:28:41.141 --> 01:28:42.186
Pling.

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.407
[Mendax]
Well done, Your Majesty.

01:28:45.581 --> 01:28:47.496
Mendax? What have you done?

01:28:47.670 --> 01:28:51.021
Fear is such a powerful emotion.

01:28:51.195 --> 01:28:54.111
It can literally
make you freeze.

01:28:55.242 --> 01:28:56.374
What are you?

01:28:56.548 --> 01:28:59.290
I am the sands of time.

01:28:59.464 --> 01:29:01.987
I am the chains that bind.

01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:05.209
I am everything you do not see.

01:29:05.383 --> 01:29:08.517
I am what you make of me.

01:29:08.691 --> 01:29:09.822
You'’re the Shroud!

01:29:09.996 --> 01:29:11.520
Yes.

01:29:11.693 --> 01:29:14.523
You are indeed
a wise little king.

01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:16.960
You lied to me!
I thought you were my friend!

01:29:17.134 --> 01:29:20.920
You used me!
You used me to get the pieces
and to find the key!

01:29:21.094 --> 01:29:23.619
[the Shroud]
And still you do not see.

01:29:23.793 --> 01:29:24.924
Why have you done this?

01:29:25.098 --> 01:29:26.752
You did this, Peter.

01:29:27.492 --> 01:29:29.364
You made me.

01:29:30.059 --> 01:29:32.932
I am your fear.

01:29:34.020 --> 01:29:36.545
But I could be so much more.

01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:40.549
For I can become anger.

01:29:41.288 --> 01:29:43.421
I can become rage.

01:29:44.639 --> 01:29:46.772
I know what pains you, Peter.

01:29:48.557 --> 01:29:51.429
I know what you keep
buried below.

01:29:51.603 --> 01:29:52.691
Show yourself!

01:29:52.865 --> 01:29:54.389
[the Shroud]
What form shall I take?

01:29:54.563 --> 01:29:56.565
[Verity screams][high-pitched ringing]

01:29:56.739 --> 01:29:59.002
Show yourself, you coward!

01:29:59.175 --> 01:30:01.004
[the Shroud] Coward?

01:30:01.178 --> 01:30:04.442
If I show myself
in three seconds,
nothing bad will happen, right?

01:30:06.313 --> 01:30:08.011
I command you to show yourself!

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:10.969
Will I? Won'’t I?

01:30:12.014 --> 01:30:14.452
What does the prophecy say?

01:30:14.626 --> 01:30:18.717
What happens next?[clock chimes, distorted]

01:30:18.891 --> 01:30:20.719
Looking for something?

01:30:24.636 --> 01:30:27.030
Watch out for the cracks, Peter.

01:30:32.035 --> 01:30:33.645
[growls]

01:30:43.655 --> 01:30:45.614
[heartbeat thumping]

01:30:46.963 --> 01:30:50.923
With each panicked breath,
each frenzied heartbeat,

01:30:51.097 --> 01:30:52.838
I grow stronger.

01:30:54.187 --> 01:30:56.146
Let me be more.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:31:01.151
Let me free of this Below
and let me be all
you need me to be.

01:31:05.242 --> 01:31:07.766
[heart rate monitor beeping]

01:31:12.858 --> 01:31:14.556
What do you see, Peter?

01:31:18.734 --> 01:31:20.518
[Peter] Verity! Wait![beeping intensifies]

01:31:20.692 --> 01:31:22.302
[whispers] It'’s magic.

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:27.916
[heart rate monitor flatlines]

01:31:28.091 --> 01:31:32.182
[David]
It'’s only been a year, and I'’m
still dealing with this.

01:31:32.356 --> 01:31:34.489
[Vivianne]
This family loses too much.

01:31:35.664 --> 01:31:36.752
[Peter] Verity!

01:31:36.925 --> 01:31:37.927
No!

01:31:52.681 --> 01:31:55.771
So now you see.

01:31:55.945 --> 01:31:59.514
The clock
will never be restored.
The time before is over.

01:31:59.688 --> 01:32:02.691
Only I can give you
the control you crave.

01:32:02.865 --> 01:32:04.648
You need me.

01:32:04.823 --> 01:32:06.912
I control you.

01:32:07.085 --> 01:32:08.740
I own you.

01:32:08.914 --> 01:32:10.437
Not anymore.

01:32:11.221 --> 01:32:13.353
I own me.

01:32:21.361 --> 01:32:24.059
[the Shroud groaning]

01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:35.853
[breathing heavily]

01:32:48.780 --> 01:32:50.085
[lock clicks]

01:33:20.377 --> 01:33:21.857
[metallic creaking]

01:33:31.127 --> 01:33:32.955
[metallic creaking]

01:33:33.129 --> 01:33:34.652
[machine clicks]

01:33:37.002 --> 01:33:39.222
[metallic creaking]

01:33:43.052 --> 01:33:44.531
[clock ticks]

01:33:49.058 --> 01:33:51.800
[metallic creaking]

01:33:52.583 --> 01:33:54.933
[clock chiming]

01:34:11.776 --> 01:34:12.777
[grunts]

01:34:16.476 --> 01:34:17.782
It'’s over, Pling.

01:34:19.915 --> 01:34:21.351
Oh, my.

01:34:22.308 --> 01:34:24.005
It'’s done.

01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:25.442
[Pling chuckles]

01:34:34.407 --> 01:34:37.193
It is as the prophecy foretold.

01:34:42.415 --> 01:34:44.504
I told you
we were underdressed.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:47.377
You said
a tire was suitable.

01:34:47.550 --> 01:34:51.294
No, I said we needed
suitable attire.

01:34:51.947 --> 01:34:53.077
[Ergo groans]

01:34:53.252 --> 01:34:54.123
Hello.Hello.

01:34:54.297 --> 01:34:55.341
Verity!

01:34:57.430 --> 01:34:59.084
I'’m proud of you.

01:34:59.258 --> 01:35:00.825
You did the brave thing.

01:35:00.999 --> 01:35:02.827
You saw
what you needed to see.

01:35:13.446 --> 01:35:16.188
Does this mean
I get to be queen now,
Mr. Pling?

01:35:17.537 --> 01:35:20.976
Yes, Miss Verity.

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:30.986
You have to let me go now,
Peter.

01:36:00.842 --> 01:36:03.758
Yeah, mate, we'’re gonna have
this room fixed up
before you know it.

01:36:04.628 --> 01:36:05.803
Did you do--

01:36:05.977 --> 01:36:07.718
I guess the light
got in.

01:36:09.154 --> 01:36:13.724
Dad, close your eyes
and tell me what you see.

01:36:13.898 --> 01:36:16.379
[chuckles]
Okay, so, it was crazy.

01:36:16.553 --> 01:36:19.208
Um, I was sitting on the bed,
just in the middle of the night,

01:36:19.382 --> 01:36:21.993
and suddenly,
it fell down straight through.

01:37:42.813 --> 01:37:43.945
[Pling] Uh...

01:37:44.119 --> 01:37:48.123
[humming vocal warm-up notes]

01:37:52.388 --> 01:37:55.826
[continues humming notes]

01:37:58.219 --> 01:37:59.656
Oh, oh, oh. Uh--
