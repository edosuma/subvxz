on “Criminal Minds”...

00:02.926 --> 00:04.651
It's Gideon.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.083
Did he suffer?

00:07.085 --> 00:08.716
Not for long, no.

00:08.718 --> 00:10.763
Did you hear any of that?

00:10.765 --> 00:12.105
He didn't suffer.

00:12.107 --> 00:15.334
I'd just really like to play
one more game of chess with him.

00:15.336 --> 00:16.775
Yeah.

00:16.777 --> 00:19.298
But time will pass
and slowly you'll forget

00:19.300 --> 00:22.211
how much it hurts.
Then maybe you'll find something else

00:22.213 --> 00:25.852
to fill that empty space.

00:25.854 --> 00:28.313
I don't want to find
something else.

What, are you
working late?

00:53.810 --> 00:56.241
Just, uh, waiting
for rush hour to subside.

00:56.242 --> 00:59.308
A lot of close personal
contact on the subway right now.

00:59.309 --> 01:03.211
It's 10:00. The trains
have been empty for a while.

01:03.213 --> 01:04.553
Go home.

01:04.554 --> 01:06.823
The chess will keep
till tomorrow.

01:06.824 --> 01:09.767
Yeah. Probably just
gonna pack it up right now.

01:09.769 --> 01:12.166

Sorry about that.

You gonna serve 'em or what?

02:12.099 --> 02:14.429
Are you gonna get
the order right, or what?

02:14.431 --> 02:17.087
I didn't know Belgium
was in Mexico.

02:17.089 --> 02:19.810

Uh, the cream?

02:28.934 --> 02:30.437
Right. Just a sec.

02:30.439 --> 02:32.327
Just let him get used to it.

Breakfast burrito

omelet for you.

02:35.563 --> 02:38.023
I asked for chives.

02:43.178 --> 02:44.995
You two have a chance
to look at the menu,

02:44.997 --> 02:47.113
or do you need
a few more minutes?

02:47.115 --> 02:48.164
No, we come here
all the time.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.537
Do you have anything
that's gluten free?

02:50.539 --> 02:51.721
They don't have
gluten free.

02:51.723 --> 02:53.003
It's worth asking.

02:53.005 --> 02:54.316
Oh, you're right.
Sorry.

02:54.318 --> 02:56.080
Could we get some chives?
Can you check on my order, please?

02:56.082 --> 02:57.515
Why can't you let me
have a conversation with the waiter?

02:57.517 --> 03:00.170
Order up!
Do you have any hot sauce?

03:00.171 --> 03:01.230
Eggs are runny.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.666
Help!

03:16.950 --> 03:20.404
An explosion happened
at a Beanery Brew house

03:20.406 --> 03:21.656
in Indianapolis
earlier this morning.

03:21.658 --> 03:24.793
First responders are reporting
6 deaths, 16 wounded.

03:24.795 --> 03:25.974
Brave guy.

03:25.976 --> 03:28.185
Anyone claimed
responsibility?

03:28.187 --> 03:29.397
Not yet.

03:29.399 --> 03:31.001
No, but Indianapolis P.D.
believes it may be related

03:31.003 --> 03:33.210
to a bomb that went off
in an elementary school last week.

03:33.212 --> 03:34.805
Yeah. That was
relatively low yield.

03:34.807 --> 03:38.295
It claimed the life
of Morton Truby.

03:38.297 --> 03:39.797
He was a custodian
working graveyard shift.

03:39.799 --> 03:41.239
Authorities
found traces of TNT.

03:41.240 --> 03:43.410
Until today they thought
it was an isolated incident.

03:43.412 --> 03:45.205
Could this be another
Boston or Oklahoma City?

03:45.207 --> 03:47.794
Beanery is a popular chain.
Exactly the type of location

03:47.796 --> 03:49.901
a domestic terrorist
would target.

03:49.903 --> 03:51.565
The unsub wants everyone
looking over their shoulder.

03:51.566 --> 03:55.530
And we also shouldn't rule out a
disgruntled employee or fundamental groups.

03:55.532 --> 03:58.063
At this point we can't rule anything out.
Let's move.

04:00.529 --> 04:03.504
TNT doesn't pack
much bang for its buck.

04:03.506 --> 04:05.514
It'd be pretty hard
to hide the amount needed

04:05.516 --> 04:06.956
to cause the damage
to that coffee house.

04:06.958 --> 04:09.519
This feels like page 118.

04:09.521 --> 04:10.478
“The anarchist cookbook.”

04:10.480 --> 04:12.849
“TNT for dummies.”

04:12.850 --> 04:15.083
The blast at the school
seems rudimentary.

04:15.085 --> 04:17.201
It may have been
the unsub's testing ground.

04:17.202 --> 04:20.207
The coffee house could indicate
a drastic escalation.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.839
The book also teaches you
to make Nitroglycerin,

04:21.841 --> 04:23.980
and a coffee shop could represent
a steep learning curve.

04:23.982 --> 04:26.312
So this guy is either
quick on his feet

04:26.314 --> 04:28.360
or both blasts were part
of a sophisticated plan.

04:28.362 --> 04:29.673
In that case,
we can't be certain

04:29.675 --> 04:31.953
that the coffee house
is this guy's finale.

04:31.955 --> 04:33.328
Yeah. Which is why
the plane's been ready.

04:33.330 --> 04:34.993
We can be in Indianapolis
in two hours.

05:43.067 --> 05:44.830
This is interesting.
The maintenance worker

05:44.832 --> 05:46.265
killed at the school
was working late

05:46.267 --> 05:47.707
installing a new
circuit panel.

05:47.709 --> 05:48.889
He wasn't supposed
to be there.

05:48.891 --> 05:50.652
So the unsub may not have intended
to kill anyone.

05:50.654 --> 05:52.891
And if he canvassed
the site beforehand,

05:52.893 --> 05:54.356
he would have anticipated
the school being empty.

05:54.358 --> 05:55.415
Exactly.

05:55.417 --> 05:56.788
But with the coffee house,

05:56.790 --> 05:58.646
he struck first thing in the morning,

Maximizing
collateral damage.

06:01.119 --> 06:03.834
I don't like it.
That's a pretty fast confidence boost.

06:03.836 --> 06:07.194
Successful bombers always have
a practice run. Maybe the school was his.

06:07.196 --> 06:08.636
But what's his endgame?

06:08.638 --> 06:10.585
Most bombers like the attention
they get from playing God.

06:10.587 --> 06:12.058
They don't go dormant,
they strike again.

06:12.060 --> 06:13.309
So will this guy.

06:13.311 --> 06:16.219
No one's claimed
responsibility for either attack.

06:16.220 --> 06:18.046
That could point away
from a fundamentalist

06:18.047 --> 06:20.255
or a fear driven offender.

06:20.257 --> 06:21.566
Maybe it's personal.

06:21.568 --> 06:23.260
We'll rely on
divide and conquer.

06:23.262 --> 06:24.693
Victims, witnesses,
and ballistics.

06:24.695 --> 06:27.605
See if we can find a pattern
so we can prevent a third attack.

06:37.745 --> 06:40.243
Uh-uh. Excuse me,
have you seen agent--

06:45.036 --> 06:48.684
Please, can you help me?
I can't find my dad.

06:48.686 --> 06:49.896
Of course.
What's his name?

06:49.898 --> 06:52.582
Pat. Pat Aguilar.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.983
We were together
at the coffee house.

06:54.985 --> 06:56.455
Ok, I'll see if I can
find anything out for you.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.503
Please! I need to know.

06:58.505 --> 07:02.024
Where was your father
when the bomb went off?

07:02.026 --> 07:04.264
He had to go
to the bathroom,

07:04.265 --> 07:07.463
but he let some pregnant
lady in first.

07:07.465 --> 07:10.247
Please, no one's telling me.

07:10.249 --> 07:11.812
I'll see what I can
find out, ok? Excuse me.

07:11.814 --> 07:12.771
Reid.

07:12.773 --> 07:15.497
He can't find his father.

07:15.499 --> 07:17.352
There are a number
of people still in surgery.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.238
Maybe we should consider
cognitive interviews.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.347
Witness accounts are varied,
which is to be expected.

07:21.349 --> 07:23.142
When people are more
emotionally ready, it'll be a good idea.

07:23.144 --> 07:24.577
Have you seen the pregnant
woman anywhere?

07:24.579 --> 07:25.666
Yeah, she's still
in the delivery room.

07:25.668 --> 07:27.108
We should talk to the guy
who rescued her.

07:27.110 --> 07:28.549
He may have seen something
the others didn't.

07:28.551 --> 07:29.670
Allen Archer. He's been
treated and released.

07:29.671 --> 07:31.295
JJ and Kate are on their way
to his house now.

07:31.297 --> 07:32.737
Are you gonna be ok?
I need to see the M.E.

07:32.738 --> 07:34.431
I'm fine. Thanks.
Excuse me, do you know

07:34.433 --> 07:36.256
if you have a patient
named Pat Aguilar?

07:36.258 --> 07:39.071
I'm just about to notify
the family, sir.

07:39.073 --> 07:40.767
He didn't make it.

07:46.846 --> 07:50.081
I know. I'm so sorry.

07:52.766 --> 07:55.519
It looks like the media
is scrambling for a sound bite

07:55.521 --> 07:56.702
from their local hero.

07:56.704 --> 07:58.076
Yeah, I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

07:58.078 --> 07:59.903
Anybody with half a right mind
would have done the same thing.

07:59.905 --> 08:02.333
But they didn't.
You did.

08:02.335 --> 08:03.424
How's the mother?

08:03.426 --> 08:04.513
She went into labor.

08:04.515 --> 08:05.947
It's a boy.

08:07.390 --> 08:09.183
Was this
a terrorist attack?

08:09.185 --> 08:10.586
Obviously.

08:10.588 --> 08:13.239
I don't think we're classifying it
as terrorism just yet.

08:13.241 --> 08:15.831
So did you notice anything suspicious
when you ran inside?

08:15.833 --> 08:17.849
Anyone that didn't
seem panicked?

08:17.851 --> 08:20.150
No. No,
nothing like that.

08:20.152 --> 08:22.165
Did you see where
the blast came from?

08:22.167 --> 08:24.213
Um, there were two,

08:24.215 --> 08:25.617
I guess.

08:25.619 --> 08:30.005
When I ran in there,
there was only a small fire.

08:30.007 --> 08:33.140
But then the back wall
just exploded.

08:33.143 --> 08:34.765
Who's the man
in the photos?

08:34.768 --> 08:36.690
Uh, my first husband,
Grant.

08:36.692 --> 08:39.566
He was a Navy SEAL.
He died in Afghanistan.

08:39.568 --> 08:41.361
And you all were friends?

08:41.363 --> 08:42.702
Yeah. Allen introduced us.

08:42.703 --> 08:44.812
It's, uh, it's almost 3:00.

08:44.814 --> 08:46.730
I have to pick up Hannah.

08:46.732 --> 08:48.265
Yeah.

08:48.267 --> 08:50.059
It's our daughter.

08:50.061 --> 08:52.106
I'll, uh,
I'll go with you.

08:52.108 --> 08:53.893
That way you don't have to fend off
the reporters alone.

08:53.895 --> 08:56.938
Oh, I think we can
help you there.

09:00.584 --> 09:03.749
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm SSA Jennifer Jareau,

09:03.751 --> 09:05.192
this is SSA Kate Callahan.

09:05.194 --> 09:08.069
I'd like to make a statement
on behalf of the Archer family.

09:08.071 --> 09:11.723
Allen Archer did what anyone
in his place would have done.

09:11.725 --> 09:14.152
Allen saved a woman,
and in doing so,

09:14.154 --> 09:16.099
saved her child,
who I am happy to report

09:16.101 --> 09:18.116
was born
less than an hour ago.

09:18.118 --> 09:19.396
Mother and child
are doing fine,

09:19.398 --> 09:21.060
as is Allen and his wife.

09:21.062 --> 09:22.716
But they are
understandably shaken.

09:22.718 --> 09:25.570
The Archer family asks that
you please give them privacy

09:25.572 --> 09:27.710
As they deal with
today's tragic events.

09:27.712 --> 09:29.918
Wait! That's the family.
They're leaving!

09:29.920 --> 09:31.868
Sorry, guys, guess you're
gonna have to capitalize

09:31.869 --> 09:33.249
on somebody else's
trauma today.

09:33.250 --> 09:35.258
Thank you.

09:35.260 --> 09:38.334
The guy planted the device
in the bathroom.

09:38.336 --> 09:40.384
“Lethal Weapon” style.

09:40.386 --> 09:41.857
What type of explosive
did he use?

09:41.859 --> 09:43.676
TNT. Same as the school.

09:43.678 --> 09:45.151
The wiring's kind of sketch.

09:45.153 --> 09:46.494
How do you mean?

09:46.496 --> 09:47.997
The soldering work,
it's not the best.

09:47.999 --> 09:49.408
I'd say he put it
together in a hurry.

09:49.410 --> 09:52.162
Maybe he was hesitant
about killing so many people.

09:52.164 --> 09:54.786
Or nervous. You'd need a lot more
TNT to do this kind of damage.

09:54.788 --> 09:58.147
You would think,
but...

09:58.149 --> 10:00.097
Take a look at this.

10:00.099 --> 10:01.985
Right here.

10:01.987 --> 10:04.518
Because he put
the bomb in the toilet,

10:04.520 --> 10:06.720
the blast is pretty well contained,
or at least it should have been.

10:06.722 --> 10:10.120
But the explosion shot back,
rupturing the natural gas line.

10:10.122 --> 10:11.525
Increasing the explosion
tenfold.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.438
The question is,
was it coincidental or intentional?

10:14.440 --> 10:16.132
He's still a bad dude,
either way.

10:16.134 --> 10:19.010
Yeah, but the answer
will weigh heavily on our profile.

10:19.012 --> 10:20.422
How so?

10:20.424 --> 10:22.723
Well, if the gas line
rupture was an accident,

10:22.724 --> 10:24.770
the unsub's motive
may not be to kill.

10:24.772 --> 10:27.616
So learning he claimed
so many lives could unravel him,

10:27.617 --> 10:28.835
make him
even more dangerous.

10:28.837 --> 10:29.948
Exactly.

10:29.950 --> 10:31.230
But if the gas line
was planned,

10:31.232 --> 10:32.511
then this unsub's
learning curve

10:32.513 --> 10:34.429
is something to be
reckoned with.

10:34.430 --> 10:36.062
He might try
to outdo himself.

10:36.064 --> 10:37.503
Neither of those are
particularly good options.

10:37.505 --> 10:39.836
Well, what's good is
we can rule out terrorism.

10:39.838 --> 10:42.427
What's bad is we have
absolutely no idea who this guy is.

10:42.429 --> 10:44.030
I'm running
a trace analysis

10:44.031 --> 10:45.655
to determine
the manufacturer of the TNT.

10:45.657 --> 10:47.228
I will download you ASAP.

10:47.230 --> 10:48.317
Thank you.

10:48.319 --> 10:50.619
Um, Einstein, huh?

10:50.621 --> 10:53.212
Heh. Bet you don't
ever forget it.

10:53.214 --> 10:56.571
You're kind of young to be a forensic
specialist, aren't you?

10:56.573 --> 10:59.802
Finished medical school
at 19 and then residency afterwards.

10:59.804 --> 11:03.062
My dad really wanted me
to live up to the family name.

11:22.290 --> 11:23.509
Again?

11:23.511 --> 11:26.194
Uh--it helps me focus.

11:26.196 --> 11:29.391
You know, in light
of recent events,

11:29.393 --> 11:32.719
I think it's ok
to give yourself a break.

11:32.721 --> 11:35.503
An entire night, though.

11:35.505 --> 11:36.746
What do you mean?

11:36.748 --> 11:38.763
You're wearing the same
shirt from yesterday,

11:38.765 --> 11:41.255
and you're covering it
with a cardigan from your go bag.

11:41.257 --> 11:44.454
Guess I must have gotten
a little carried away last night.

11:44.456 --> 11:47.014
Well, it happens.

11:47.015 --> 11:50.213
...Leaving 7 people dead
and countless others injured.

11:50.215 --> 11:52.612
But in the wake of horror,
came to story of...

11:52.614 --> 11:56.487
So, uh, what drives
most bombers?

11:56.489 --> 11:58.306
Ego, craves attention.

11:58.308 --> 11:59.495
Allen Archer...

11:59.497 --> 12:02.664
So he has to share
his headlines.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.448
He's not gonna
be happy about that.

12:05.450 --> 12:08.103
He might try
to reclaim that attention.

12:08.105 --> 12:09.890
The only way to do that
is to strike again,

12:09.892 --> 12:12.936
somewhere he can ensure
a higher body count.

12:12.938 --> 12:15.238
Or a personal one.

12:19.398 --> 12:21.315
You were so brave today.

12:21.316 --> 12:22.789
I was lucky.

12:22.790 --> 12:26.663
I still can't believe
I ran back into the fire like that.

12:27.878 --> 12:31.852
Well, you heard what
those two agents said.

12:31.854 --> 12:34.091
You're a hero.

12:34.093 --> 12:36.554
You saved two lives.

12:36.556 --> 12:39.530
When the second blast hit,

12:39.531 --> 12:43.465
I thought that that was it.

12:44.741 --> 12:47.239
Thought I'd never see you
and Hannah again.

12:47.241 --> 12:49.318
Ohh...

12:58.342 --> 13:00.167
Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing up?

13:00.169 --> 13:01.287
I heard noises.

13:01.289 --> 13:03.044
I thought someone
was in the house.

13:03.046 --> 13:05.799
Oh, honey, it's just us.
Come here.

13:08.517 --> 13:11.238
Hey, did you know
that Allen

13:11.240 --> 13:14.821
saved a woman and a baby
from a fire today?

13:14.823 --> 13:15.781
Really?

13:15.783 --> 13:17.162
Really.

13:17.164 --> 13:18.313
Cool.

13:19.849 --> 13:21.288
I think
it's pretty cool, too.

13:21.290 --> 13:22.692
Tell me what happened.

13:22.694 --> 13:26.243
Oh, sweetie, I think it's time
we get you back to bed, ok?

13:26.245 --> 13:28.964
I promise you everything
is fine, fine, fine.

13:28.966 --> 13:30.719
Ok, come on.

13:32.960 --> 13:33.947
Good night, Allen.

13:33.949 --> 13:36.639
Good night, sweetheart.

13:36.641 --> 13:37.851
Hey, babe.

13:37.853 --> 13:39.193
I'm gonna run
to the store.

13:39.195 --> 13:40.152
Ok.

13:40.154 --> 13:42.300
Ok. I'll be right back.

13:45.247 --> 13:47.132
With the death toll
rising to 7 earlier this afternoon,

13:47.134 --> 13:50.715
Indianapolis P.D. has released
the names of those deceased,

13:50.717 --> 13:52.378
including Pat Aguilar, 65,

13:52.380 --> 13:57.271
Grace Kelver, 19,
Joe Gardez, 27,

13:57.273 --> 13:58.807
Scott Laker, 11,

13:58.809 --> 13:59.988
Jackson Novert, 21.

13:59.990 --> 14:02.167
Ryan Batson, 46,

14:02.169 --> 14:04.055
and Bree , 32.

14:04.056 --> 14:05.972
Federal authorities
remain baffled

14:05.974 --> 14:07.958
as to the perpetrators--

14:23.954 --> 14:25.264
Oh, my God.

14:31.193 --> 14:33.786
Aah...

14:40.766 --> 14:43.533
You gotta go, baby.
You gotta go, please.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.137
Take Hannah
and you get away from me.

14:45.139 --> 14:47.380
Far away from me,
you hear me?

14:47.382 --> 14:49.299
Take Hannah and go!
Brenda, please!

14:49.301 --> 14:50.773
You gotta get out
of here, baby.

14:50.775 --> 14:52.401
Ma'am, you need to get
your daughter out of here.

14:52.402 --> 14:53.844
Ma'am, you need to get
your daughter out of here.

14:53.846 --> 14:56.054
I'm sorry, but you have to.
No, I'm not leaving Allen.

14:56.056 --> 14:58.740
This is for you and
your daughter's safety. Please trust us.

14:58.742 --> 14:59.860
You get away from here, ok?

14:59.862 --> 15:01.847
Get out of here, please!

15:01.849 --> 15:03.572
Please help him.

15:03.574 --> 15:05.176
We will.

15:05.178 --> 15:06.519
Ok? All right.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.570
Come this way, ma'am.

15:07.572 --> 15:09.173
How the hell did we
beat the bomb squad here?

15:09.175 --> 15:11.506
I could give you statistics,
but I don't think this is the time.

15:11.508 --> 15:14.775
Are we really gonna do this?

15:15.990 --> 15:18.105
Turn your cell phone off.

15:32.373 --> 15:34.865
Nitroglycerin.

15:36.823 --> 15:38.930
No, no, no.
Stay back. Stay back!

15:38.932 --> 15:40.181
Stay back. I don't want
anybody else to get hurt.

15:40.183 --> 15:41.553
Stop talking. Just listen.
Just listen to me.

15:41.555 --> 15:43.570
We're with the FBI
and we're here to help.

15:43.572 --> 15:44.911
When you put
your foot down,

15:44.913 --> 15:46.767
you triggered
the arming mechanism.

15:46.768 --> 15:48.047
Now, if you move,

15:48.049 --> 15:49.741
you could set it off.

15:49.742 --> 15:51.750
Where are Brenda and Hannah?
Are they ok?

15:51.752 --> 15:54.088
I don't want them to die, too.
Nobody's gonna die.

15:54.090 --> 15:56.104
They're safe. don't worry.
Bomb squad's gonna be here soon.

15:56.106 --> 15:58.885
I need you to keep the exact pressure
that you have on that brake

15:58.887 --> 16:00.257
as you have right now.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.044
If you don't, all 3
of us are gonna die.

16:02.046 --> 16:04.383
Well, can you do something?

16:04.385 --> 16:06.140
Can you?

16:19.320 --> 16:20.247
This thing's homemade,

16:20.249 --> 16:22.324
but the framework
is familiar.

16:22.326 --> 16:24.847
Yeah. Yeah, I can
disarm this.

16:24.849 --> 16:25.998
I just need something sharp.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.914
I've got a knife
in my glove box.

16:37.843 --> 16:40.817
It's underneath the map.
Right there.

16:42.223 --> 16:43.564
Sir, just sit still.
You're doing fine.

16:43.566 --> 16:46.509
Ok. I'm gonna get you
out of here.

16:46.511 --> 16:47.628
Here.

16:50.189 --> 16:52.739
Hey, kid.

16:52.741 --> 16:55.136
I think you should back up.

16:55.137 --> 16:56.606
Not happening.

16:56.608 --> 16:58.270
What's the next step?

17:01.528 --> 17:04.952
The trick is rendering
the pressure sensor inactive

17:04.954 --> 17:07.635
without letting the detonator
think that it's time to go.

17:07.637 --> 17:10.386
The only problem is, this son
of a bitch built this thing by himself

17:10.387 --> 17:12.079
and he used all the same
color wires.

17:12.080 --> 17:14.509
7 wires and you don't
know which one to cut?

17:14.511 --> 17:16.425
I'm not so crazy
about these odds.

17:17.577 --> 17:20.227
It's gotta be one of
these two right here.

17:20.229 --> 17:21.766
Guys, you gotta do
something quick here, man.

17:21.768 --> 17:23.492
My foot is cramping up.
I cannot keep my foot on the pedal--

17:23.492 --> 17:25.507
Sir, please, please.
If you want to stay alive,

17:25.509 --> 17:28.707
I need you to keep that foot down
and try to sit still, please.

17:31.333 --> 17:33.411
Reid...

17:33.413 --> 17:35.649
It's probably this wire
right here,

17:35.651 --> 17:38.363
if he stayed true
to the original design.

17:38.365 --> 17:40.380
Go with your gut.

17:53.108 --> 17:54.770
What? Well?

17:54.772 --> 17:56.940
Sir, you're fine.
You can get out of the car.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.268
Are you serious? You did it?
You did it? I'm gonna live?

18:00.270 --> 18:01.549
Let's get you
to your family.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.393
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

18:04.395 --> 18:06.380
Thank you.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.688
You've got 4
Nitroglycerin packs.

18:16.689 --> 18:17.708
Now, I've defused it,

18:17.710 --> 18:19.311
but the nitro
is homemade.

18:19.313 --> 18:21.714
It's almost guaranteed
to be unstable.

18:21.716 --> 18:23.219
Copy that.

18:23.221 --> 18:25.968
Rossi was right.
The unsub doesn't like sharing attention.

18:25.969 --> 18:28.438
So he's decided
to eliminate Allen Archer.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.256
And now he's graduated
to Nitroglycerin.

18:30.257 --> 18:32.401
Page 113. We should
put the Archers in protective custody

18:32.404 --> 18:33.521
until further notice.

18:33.523 --> 18:35.245
Once the bomb squad's
done clearing that house,

18:35.247 --> 18:36.846
I want to take another look
at that device

18:36.848 --> 18:38.469
and see if there's anything
else we can learn.

18:38.471 --> 18:39.880
We believe the man
you're looking for

18:39.882 --> 18:42.085
is an ego driven
personal cause bomber.

18:42.087 --> 18:44.546
In other words, he needs to be the
center of attention.

18:44.548 --> 18:46.494
That's why we're advising that
you keep the location

18:46.495 --> 18:48.064
for tonight's bombing
attempt confidential.

18:48.066 --> 18:50.909
If the unsub sees headlines
that don't belong to him,

18:50.911 --> 18:52.666
we believe
he'll become enraged.

18:52.668 --> 18:54.239
He seems pretty
angry now.

18:54.241 --> 18:55.864
Yes, he wants us
to pay attention.

18:55.866 --> 18:57.306
Even if it means
targeting the man

18:57.308 --> 18:58.616
who's disrupting
his message.

18:58.618 --> 19:00.180
So what's his message?

19:00.182 --> 19:01.139
Look at me.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.419
Fear me.

19:02.421 --> 19:03.923
I am God.

19:03.925 --> 19:06.231
His sophistication level
puts him in his 30s or 40s.

19:06.232 --> 19:09.107
TNT may be easy to produce,
but Nitroglycerin

19:09.110 --> 19:12.367
is much harder to handle.
It took patience and an eye for detail.

19:12.368 --> 19:14.001
He's controlled
and methodical.

19:14.003 --> 19:15.443
He's highly intelligent.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.298
He'll absolutely want
to witness his work,

19:17.300 --> 19:19.183
so we need to look
at traffic cams

19:19.185 --> 19:21.163
and eyewitness footage
of the blast.

19:21.165 --> 19:23.181
He could be on camera.

19:23.183 --> 19:25.772
We should also canvass
public spaces like outdoor malls,

19:25.774 --> 19:27.336
farmers markets,
monument circle.

19:27.338 --> 19:30.091
The fact that he targeted
a school and a popular coffee chain

19:30.092 --> 19:31.754
means he wants
no one to feel safe.

19:31.756 --> 19:33.289
Do you think
he'll strike again?

19:33.291 --> 19:34.398
It's inevitable.

19:34.422 --> 19:36.297
A bomber with a god complex
feels invulnerable.

19:36.298 --> 19:39.049
We need to appease him
and start communications with him.

19:39.051 --> 19:41.703
That's how we'll catch him.
Thank you.

19:48.104 --> 19:50.278
He really went for
a bigger boom this time.

19:50.280 --> 19:53.315
I recognize the make-up.
92% Nitroglycerin,

19:53.317 --> 19:54.849
8% nitrocellulose.

19:54.851 --> 19:56.643
Straight out
of the cookbook.

19:56.645 --> 19:57.856
Good memory.

19:57.858 --> 20:00.356
I have a thing for numbers.

20:00.358 --> 20:01.637
And quantum theory.

20:01.639 --> 20:03.363
Funny.

20:03.365 --> 20:05.695
The unsub certainly
singled Allen out.

20:05.697 --> 20:07.107
He could have planted
the device in his home,

20:07.109 --> 20:08.608
but instead
he chose his truck

20:08.610 --> 20:10.747
because he wanted to ensure
that Allen was the one who triggered it.

20:10.749 --> 20:11.967
He needed to make
sure the hero died.

20:11.969 --> 20:13.631
Kill the family
and they become martyrs.

20:14.876 --> 20:17.496
Well, it's a wonder he even realized
that he triggered the bomb.

20:17.498 --> 20:19.766
Maybe he heard something
when he stepped on the pedal.

20:19.768 --> 20:22.550
What, and knew not to move?
Come on, what's this guy got,

20:22.552 --> 20:24.982
an ex-paramilitary background
we don't know about?

20:24.983 --> 20:27.221
Brenda Archer's first
husband Grant was military.

20:27.224 --> 20:29.301
Is it just me, or do you think
it's odd that Allen

20:29.303 --> 20:31.256
ended up marrying
his best friend's wife?

20:31.258 --> 20:33.655
I don't know. Shared sorrow
could build a bond.

20:33.657 --> 20:36.691
JJ and Kate said the house
was a shrine to the deceased.

20:36.693 --> 20:39.215
Well, that would explain
why he kept all this stuff out here.

20:39.217 --> 20:41.524
He feels like he's living
in someone else's home.

20:41.526 --> 20:44.691
That kind of man
would be desperate for recognition.

20:45.935 --> 20:48.719
He was crying.

20:51.254 --> 20:52.527
This could be why.

20:52.529 --> 20:55.030
Reliving trauma
or feeling guilty about something.

20:55.032 --> 20:56.819
And his wife.
I think we should ask him.

20:56.821 --> 20:59.797
That's what you guys do.
You just talk a lot.

20:59.799 --> 21:03.572
Well, there's also
a lot of kicking down doors involved.

21:03.574 --> 21:05.884
Sure. I'm heading back
to the lab.

21:05.886 --> 21:07.773
Thanks.
I'll let you know what I find.

21:12.449 --> 21:14.750
Garcia, did you find anything in
Brenda and Allen Archer's background

21:14.752 --> 21:17.022
to indicate a knowledge
of explosives?

21:17.023 --> 21:18.051
Nothing that sticks out.

21:18.053 --> 21:20.029
But I am the queen
of lots of things,

21:20.031 --> 21:21.917
including subtlety.

21:23.107 --> 21:25.629
Oh, shut up. I'm talking...

21:25.631 --> 21:28.252
Deftly sift through
information stuff.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.441
He's a carpenter

21:29.443 --> 21:32.540
who has a severe
Amazon addiction.

21:32.542 --> 21:33.912
Kindle, to be specific.

21:33.914 --> 21:35.224
What kind of books?

21:35.226 --> 21:37.273
Self-help.
A lot of emo stuff.

21:37.275 --> 21:39.454
Build your self-esteem,
how to get over depression.

21:39.456 --> 21:41.020
Coming out of your shell.

21:41.022 --> 21:43.007
A whole bunch
of comic books.

21:43.009 --> 21:44.701
Nothing “How to build
a bomb” related?

21:44.703 --> 21:45.882
No. Sorry.

21:45.884 --> 21:48.381
Oh, he is seeing
a marriage counselor.

21:48.383 --> 21:49.885
Hmm. Thinks are not so good
on the homefront.

21:49.887 --> 21:51.166
They've certainly
improved now.

21:51.168 --> 21:52.316
She was all over him
when we interviewed them.

21:52.318 --> 21:53.942
Something tells me
that's not ordinary.

21:53.944 --> 21:55.544
Allen is living
in the shadow of Grant Ford.

21:55.546 --> 21:57.297
Maybe the coffee shop
was his introduction.

21:57.299 --> 21:59.825
Garcia, Brenda's first husband
Grant Ford was a Navy SEAL.

21:59.827 --> 22:01.106
What was his specialty?

22:01.108 --> 22:02.226
Oh, that's a good question.

22:02.228 --> 22:05.422
Give me a moment.
It was...

22:05.424 --> 22:08.047
Explosive ordnance.

22:12.619 --> 22:15.783
He ran into the coffee shop
moments before the secondary blast

22:15.785 --> 22:17.223
from the ruptured
gas line.

22:17.225 --> 22:19.047
Well, it could have
just been an accident.

22:19.049 --> 22:21.509
So his wife is a witness,
Allen races into the blaze

22:21.511 --> 22:23.970
and saves the most
sympathetic person he can think of.

22:23.972 --> 22:26.879
And becomes a hero
to his wife.

22:36.229 --> 22:38.569
Hey, Reid.

22:47.981 --> 22:50.058
Yeah, we got him, Hotch.

22:51.978 --> 22:53.993
Have a seat.

22:53.995 --> 22:55.433
What's this about?

22:55.435 --> 22:58.056
Sit down.

23:08.518 --> 23:10.111
I don't understand.

23:10.113 --> 23:11.683
First I'm in
protective custody,

23:11.685 --> 23:13.632
now I'm in
an interrogation room?

23:13.634 --> 23:15.297
What the hell is going on?

23:15.299 --> 23:16.579
Where is my husband?

23:16.581 --> 23:18.788
We heard you had
a rough night.

23:18.790 --> 23:21.795
A rough night.
Are you serious?

23:21.797 --> 23:23.490
The stress can be
unbearable.

23:23.492 --> 23:25.246
We can get you some
water if you want.

23:25.248 --> 23:27.425
I want to be
with my daughter.

23:27.427 --> 23:29.730
We almost died last night.

23:29.732 --> 23:31.526
It's interesting
that you didn't, though.

23:31.528 --> 23:33.507
Why do you think
that is?

23:33.509 --> 23:36.130
Most people's flight instincts
would take over.

23:36.132 --> 23:38.086
They'd flee,
setting off the bomb.

23:38.088 --> 23:39.591
How did you know
what to do?

23:39.592 --> 23:42.116
Uh, I don't know.

23:42.118 --> 23:43.366
I felt something click.

23:43.368 --> 23:46.120
What clicked?
A remote? A wire?

23:46.122 --> 23:48.513
No, the hairs on the back
of my neck were standing up.

23:48.515 --> 23:51.045
And I looked down
and I saw something.

23:51.047 --> 23:54.052
It--I didn't know what,

23:54.054 --> 23:56.705
but I thought the bomber
might be coming after me

23:56.707 --> 23:58.944
and I froze. I froze.

23:58.946 --> 24:02.049
“I didn't know what.”

24:02.051 --> 24:03.805
What?

24:03.807 --> 24:06.206
That was the lie, Allen.
You're not even good at hiding it.

24:06.208 --> 24:07.485
You swallowed before
you said it

24:07.487 --> 24:09.019
and you looked over my
shoulder when you did.

24:09.021 --> 24:11.771
So because I need
a glass of water, I'm guilty?

24:11.773 --> 24:14.547
If you're not guilty,
then why did you hide Grant's books?

24:14.549 --> 24:15.635
He's not even
denying it.

24:15.637 --> 24:16.756
I am denying it.

24:16.758 --> 24:19.834
Not that I had the books,
that I did anything.

24:19.836 --> 24:21.914
He pulled out the books

24:21.916 --> 24:23.448
after the explosion.

24:23.450 --> 24:27.002
He said he...wanted to understand
what nearly killed him.

24:27.004 --> 24:28.697
Who prompted
that conversation?

24:28.699 --> 24:30.171
What do you mean?

24:30.173 --> 24:32.442
Did he show you the books
and explain them, or did you find them?

24:32.444 --> 24:34.714
Oh, no, I found them
and asked about it.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.486
What?

24:39.488 --> 24:40.759
Well, why did Allen
hide the books

24:40.761 --> 24:41.848
if he was so open
about them?

24:41.850 --> 24:43.833
No, he asked me
to hide the books,

24:43.835 --> 24:46.194
because...

24:46.196 --> 24:48.916
He want there
to be any confusion

24:48.918 --> 24:51.408
when you came
to interview us.

24:54.293 --> 24:55.532
What is it?

24:55.534 --> 24:58.637
Trust your gut.
Has Allen been acting odd lately?

24:58.638 --> 25:01.318
Look, he's been working
a lot of late nights.

25:01.320 --> 25:05.318
That's not what
his work told us.

25:08.517 --> 25:12.320
I'm not saying anything else
until I see my husband.

25:21.092 --> 25:23.998
Why did you hide your
nighttime activities from your wife?

25:25.604 --> 25:27.587
You want to know
what we think?

25:27.589 --> 25:28.798
Not really, no.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.329
You lived in Grant's shadow
for far too long.

25:31.331 --> 25:34.106
You had a thing for Brenda,
you saw that he was interested,

25:34.108 --> 25:35.579
and you knew you didn't
stand a chance.

25:35.581 --> 25:37.213
How could you?
He was a hero.

25:37.215 --> 25:41.147
And you watched them fall in love,
get married, have a daughter.

25:41.149 --> 25:43.448
You watched them live
the life that you wanted.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.636
And then he died.

25:44.638 --> 25:46.452
So you waited.

25:46.454 --> 25:49.720
You waited for the
perfect opportunity

25:49.722 --> 25:53.274
to prey on Brenda's
vulnerability.

25:53.276 --> 25:54.871
And you thought it worked.

25:54.873 --> 25:55.868
You know what?

25:55.870 --> 25:58.137
She never loved you.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.911
No. That's not true.

26:01.913 --> 26:03.668
She--she loves me.

26:03.670 --> 26:05.654
Listen to yourself.
You don't even believe it.

26:05.656 --> 26:06.744
How are we supposed to?

26:06.746 --> 26:07.795
I love my wife.

26:07.797 --> 26:09.299
We believe
that much is true.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.153
We saw evidence of it
when you tried to keep Grant's daughter--

26:12.155 --> 26:14.039
my daughter.

26:14.041 --> 26:16.178
And Brenda away
from your truck.

26:16.180 --> 26:19.633
But answer this. When the bomb
went off at the coffee shop

26:19.635 --> 26:21.711
and you were directly
across the street,

26:21.712 --> 26:23.022
why did you
leave her there?

26:23.024 --> 26:25.382
You would only do that
if you knew she wasn't in danger.

26:25.384 --> 26:26.822
Because you had
planted the bomb.

26:26.824 --> 26:28.806
But you didn't plan on
the gas line rupturing,

26:28.808 --> 26:30.340
which actually
put her in danger,

26:30.342 --> 26:32.224
you just wanted
to be a hero.

26:32.226 --> 26:33.213
Like Grant.

26:33.215 --> 26:34.523
Except you're not
a hero, Allen.

26:34.525 --> 26:35.452
You're just a coward.

26:35.454 --> 26:38.173
They why did I
kill all those people?!

26:38.175 --> 26:39.677
Huh?!

26:39.679 --> 26:42.462
You have all the answers.
Why did I kill all those people?

27:04.942 --> 27:07.060
Well, that was way too easy.
Yes, it was.

27:07.061 --> 27:09.047
It doesn't make sense
that Allen would risk hurting Brenda.

27:09.049 --> 27:10.266
He values her too much.

27:10.268 --> 27:12.697
Reid said he was
legitimately scared at his house.

27:12.699 --> 27:14.807
You can't fake
fear like that.

27:14.809 --> 27:16.211
The bomb in Archer's truck

27:16.213 --> 27:17.845
was planted
by somebody else.

27:17.847 --> 27:18.835
A second unsub.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.529
Do you think Allen
pissed off a partner

27:20.531 --> 27:22.486
who decided
to take him out?

27:22.488 --> 27:25.110
Only one way to find out.

27:28.372 --> 27:30.035
We know you planted the bomb
at the coffee shop

27:30.037 --> 27:31.570
because you wanted
to be a hero,

27:31.572 --> 27:34.384
but you had nothing to do with the one
at your house last night. Who did?

27:34.386 --> 27:35.795
I have no idea.

27:35.797 --> 27:36.753
A partner?

27:36.755 --> 27:37.743
No, I worked alone.

27:37.745 --> 27:38.992
He's lying.
I'm not.

27:38.994 --> 27:40.141
Why would you plant a bomb

27:40.143 --> 27:41.551
that would put your wife
and child at risk?

27:41.552 --> 27:42.983
You wouldn't.

27:42.985 --> 27:46.118
So you either
had a partner or--

27:46.120 --> 27:49.157
you had nothing to do with
the blast at the school.

27:49.159 --> 27:52.422
You wouldn't. Your house
is in another district

27:52.424 --> 27:54.018
and there are safer
testing grounds.

27:54.020 --> 27:56.487
You heard about it, so you decided
to build a bomb of your own

27:56.489 --> 27:57.668
to impress your wife.

27:58.568 --> 27:59.494
Yes.

27:59.496 --> 28:01.634
And you killed 7 people
in the process.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.520
I never meant
for that to happen.

28:03.522 --> 28:07.455
Oh, and I'm sure that's gonna help
their families sleep much better at night.

28:07.457 --> 28:09.441
Why lie?

28:09.443 --> 28:11.067
Because you were caught?

28:11.069 --> 28:12.225
The self-sacrificial
type, huh?

28:12.227 --> 28:13.246
Shut up.

28:13.248 --> 28:15.999
You took credit
for somebody else's work.

28:16.001 --> 28:17.403
And she hates you.

28:17.405 --> 28:20.057
And the other bomber hates you
and now he wants to outdo you.

28:43.492 --> 28:45.185
Archer was a copycat.

28:45.187 --> 28:46.941
The coffee shop bombing
changes the profile.

28:46.943 --> 28:48.121
We have to start over.

28:48.123 --> 28:50.362
Eliminate the coffee shop,
what do we have?

28:50.364 --> 28:52.410
An unsub who set TNT in
a high school boiler room

28:52.412 --> 28:54.974
and Nitroglycerin in the home
of the man who stole his headlines.

28:54.976 --> 28:56.607
In a boiler room
that should have been empty.

28:56.609 --> 28:57.849
He didn't want
to kill anyone.

28:57.851 --> 28:59.352
Well, that certainly changed
at the Archer house.

28:59.354 --> 29:00.763
He went for the biggest
bang for his buck.

29:00.765 --> 29:02.236
The death of the janitor
at the high school

29:02.237 --> 29:03.478
gave the unsub
the urge to kill again.

29:03.480 --> 29:04.982
That's the bombing
we need to pay attention to.

29:04.984 --> 29:06.679
We have a problem.
Someone leaked the location

29:06.681 --> 29:07.960
of the truck bomb
to the press.

29:07.962 --> 29:09.694
Headlines are all
about Allen again.

29:09.696 --> 29:12.281
The media's calling on the mayor
to give him the key to the city.

29:12.282 --> 29:14.460
Obviously, the mayor
isn't about to do that.

29:14.462 --> 29:17.438
He has to.

29:17.440 --> 29:19.418
What's your plan, Aaron?

29:29.146 --> 29:32.314
Do you want
to be a hero?

29:32.316 --> 29:33.502
What are you talking about?

29:33.504 --> 29:35.995
Do you want to be
a real hero, like Grant?

29:35.997 --> 29:39.483
Got a chance for you
to prove yourself.

29:44.728 --> 29:46.290
You can't be serious.

29:46.292 --> 29:48.530
Believe me, if there
were any other way,

29:48.532 --> 29:51.758
we wouldn't ask.

29:51.760 --> 29:53.169
I can't see him again.

29:53.171 --> 29:55.408
He nearly killed me
and my daughter.

29:55.410 --> 29:57.483
I can't lose her, too.

29:57.485 --> 29:59.590
We will be right there
to back you up.

29:59.592 --> 30:01.575
No, I'm not doing it.

30:01.577 --> 30:03.108
You can't make me do that.

30:03.110 --> 30:04.550
You're right.

30:04.552 --> 30:07.235
You're right, I can't.

30:07.237 --> 30:10.464
All I can do is ask you
to trust us

30:10.465 --> 30:12.380
and to help save lives,

30:12.382 --> 30:15.455
the same way Grant did.

30:18.818 --> 30:20.573
That is not fair.

30:20.575 --> 30:23.647
I know it's not.

30:56.505 --> 30:59.801
I can't believe
you got the mayor to do this.

30:59.803 --> 31:02.900
Once we apprehend this guy,
it will all have been his idea.

31:02.902 --> 31:06.069
Ahh, now
it makes sense.

31:06.071 --> 31:07.795
Thank you for agreeing
to help us.

31:07.797 --> 31:09.976
I just hope you're right.
Otherwise I'm going to look bad.

31:09.978 --> 31:11.579
And I'll make sure
you do, too.

31:11.581 --> 31:12.761
Excuse me.

31:12.763 --> 31:16.376
And now I remember why
I didn't go into politics.

31:18.811 --> 31:20.728
Oklahoma.

31:20.730 --> 31:22.300
New York,

31:22.302 --> 31:23.704
Langley,

31:23.706 --> 31:25.055
Shanksville,

31:25.057 --> 31:26.559
Boston,

31:26.561 --> 31:28.416
Indianapolis.

31:28.418 --> 31:31.616
I never wanted our great
city to join that list.

31:31.618 --> 31:33.181
But those who do evil

31:33.183 --> 31:36.542
force us to face our fears
and overcome them.

31:36.544 --> 31:38.493
And we will overcome.

31:38.495 --> 31:40.573
Because of men
like Allen Archer,

31:40.575 --> 31:44.672
men willing to stand up
for what is right.

31:44.674 --> 31:47.719
It is my proud honor
to declare today

31:47.721 --> 31:49.031
Allen Archer day.

31:49.033 --> 31:51.304
Please join me
as I show Allen

31:51.306 --> 31:53.161
a sign of our appreciation

31:53.163 --> 31:54.788
for his heroic bravery

31:54.790 --> 31:56.484
in the face of hostility

31:56.485 --> 31:58.953
by giving him a key
to the Circle City.

31:58.955 --> 32:01.416
Anything?

32:01.418 --> 32:02.820
Nothing yet.

32:02.822 --> 32:04.900
All clear here.

32:04.902 --> 32:06.598
Same here.

32:11.243 --> 32:13.482
Allen is an inspiration.

32:13.483 --> 32:14.924
All too often...

32:14.926 --> 32:16.075
What have you got,
Garcia?

32:16.077 --> 32:17.800
Some exceedingly curious
information.

32:17.802 --> 32:19.758
Two weeks ago, there was
a fire at an ethanol plant.

32:19.759 --> 32:21.483
Now, there were no casualties,
but I found a connection

32:21.485 --> 32:23.080
between the ethanol plant
and the school.

32:23.082 --> 32:24.491
What's the connection?

32:24.493 --> 32:25.935
Last month a member
of the school board

32:25.937 --> 32:28.236
was fired for having sex
with a student.

32:28.238 --> 32:30.859
Now, the student was over 18,
so no charges were filed,

32:30.861 --> 32:33.643
but the member of the school
board violated his contract like massively,

32:33.645 --> 32:34.732
so he was dismissed.

32:34.734 --> 32:36.520
The sexy indiscretions
happened on the grounds

32:36.522 --> 32:37.578
of the ethanol plant.

32:37.580 --> 32:38.599
Who's the board member?

32:38.601 --> 32:39.527
James Burke.

32:39.529 --> 32:40.838
Pretty active
in the community

32:40.840 --> 32:42.089
until the affair went public.

32:42.091 --> 32:43.846
I'm sending you his photo now.
Thank you.

32:43.848 --> 32:46.500
I say, here is our secret.

32:46.502 --> 32:48.105
See us...

32:48.107 --> 32:49.480
Bogey on East Franklin.

32:49.482 --> 32:51.468
We need to shut this down.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.486
IPD, don't let that van
breech the perimeter.

32:53.488 --> 32:56.109
Reid and JJ,
get the Archers to safety.

32:56.111 --> 32:57.324
Dave, you get the mayor.

32:58.133 --> 33:00.525
We are Americans,

33:00.527 --> 33:03.187
and we defy you.

33:14.806 --> 33:16.048
Put the van in park!

33:16.050 --> 33:17.744
I was told to park on Main.

33:17.746 --> 33:18.483
That's not gonna happen.

33:18.507 --> 33:20.146
I said put it in park
or I'm gonna do it for you.

33:20.147 --> 33:21.456
Ok, ok.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.405
And get out of the car slowly.
Let me see your hands.

33:23.407 --> 33:24.878
Slowly.

33:26.514 --> 33:28.047
Open the door.

33:28.946 --> 33:30.962
Both of them.

33:32.338 --> 33:35.030
Now back away.
Back away.

33:36.788 --> 33:38.963
That's not him.

33:47.449 --> 33:50.394
It's a bomb!
Back away! Back away!

33:50.396 --> 33:51.929
Back away!

34:09.661 --> 34:12.446
What the hell?

34:15.777 --> 34:17.824
Get up. Get up.

34:17.826 --> 34:19.489
Who told you
to bring the van here?

34:19.491 --> 34:23.485
Some--some guy.
He paid me 200 bucks to drive it.

34:23.487 --> 34:24.443
This guy?

34:24.445 --> 34:25.885
Yeah, yeah, that's him.

34:27.867 --> 34:29.407
It's a decoy.

34:29.409 --> 34:32.092
Go to your secondary
locations. He's here somewhere.

34:39.358 --> 34:40.888
What the hell's going on?

34:40.889 --> 34:43.159
The bomber's here.
We don't know where.

34:43.161 --> 34:44.411
Evacuate the area.

34:44.414 --> 34:45.884
This is on you.

35:11.062 --> 35:12.470
It's over, James.

35:14.449 --> 35:16.688
I'm the one
with the bomb.

35:16.690 --> 35:17.868
Yes, you are.

35:17.870 --> 35:19.694
You're not gonna use it.

35:19.696 --> 35:21.420
Why is that, then?

35:23.117 --> 35:26.607
You're a narcissist.
You've craved power your whole life.

35:26.609 --> 35:29.999
And when you lost
that, you snapped.

35:30.001 --> 35:32.655
How could all those people
you call friends

35:32.657 --> 35:34.551
turn their backs on you?

35:34.553 --> 35:38.993
You didn't even
do anything wrong, James.

35:38.995 --> 35:40.274
I didn't.

35:40.276 --> 35:43.311
She was 18.
It's not even illegal.

35:43.313 --> 35:45.550
How could they fire you
over that?

35:45.552 --> 35:47.435
How could they ruin your life?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.249
So you planted a bomb,

35:50.251 --> 35:52.142
burned down
one of the schools

35:52.144 --> 35:53.606
so the new board
would panic.

35:53.608 --> 35:55.783
Only you accidentally
took a life.

35:55.785 --> 35:59.108
And then you realized the only way
anyone would ever notice you

35:59.110 --> 36:01.438
is if you killed again.

36:02.368 --> 36:05.403
I should set this off
and take you out with me.

36:05.405 --> 36:07.450
You're not gonna do that.

36:07.451 --> 36:10.615
Because you
think you are God.

36:10.617 --> 36:12.441
And Gods don't die.

36:12.443 --> 36:16.598
You will die if you
detonate that, James.

36:16.600 --> 36:18.869
And then you will never
have the chance to take credit

36:18.871 --> 36:20.917
for the bombs you did build.

36:20.919 --> 36:23.379
Put down the bomb

36:23.381 --> 36:25.972
so we can tell everyone
what you did and why.

36:45.878 --> 36:47.340
Let's go.

36:50.767 --> 36:52.197
So how'd you know he'd
head to the basement?

36:52.199 --> 36:54.150
Well, the fire at the ethanol
plant and at the school

36:54.152 --> 36:55.624
both happened
in the electrical rooms.

36:55.626 --> 36:58.563
I apologize for earlier.

36:58.564 --> 37:00.037
Thank you for trusting us.

37:01.127 --> 37:03.272
I just want you to know
how much it meant to me

37:03.274 --> 37:04.838
that you would do this.

37:04.839 --> 37:07.138
I didn't do it for you.

37:14.599 --> 37:16.806
Brenda.

37:16.808 --> 37:18.371
I just wanted
to say thank you.

37:18.373 --> 37:20.963
I know this wasn't easy, and we
couldn't have done this without you.

37:20.965 --> 37:23.780
But the good thing
about being a mom,

37:23.781 --> 37:25.697
you'll always
be her hero.

37:25.699 --> 37:26.917
Mommy!

37:26.918 --> 37:30.117
♪ We'll be just fine ♪

37:31.493 --> 37:32.879
♪ we'll be just fine... ♪

37:32.880 --> 37:35.985
“True heroism is remarkably sober.
Very undramatic.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.671
“It is not the urge
to surpass others at whatever cost,

37:38.673 --> 37:42.256
but the urge to serve

37:42.258 --> 37:43.699
Arthur Ashe.

37:43.701 --> 37:48.889
♪ Till our...Stand still ♪

38:07.666 --> 38:09.773
You ever gonna finish
this game?

38:09.775 --> 38:11.021
It's a tough one.

38:11.023 --> 38:13.292
Playing yourself
can be difficult.

38:13.293 --> 38:16.811
Playing a ghost
even more so.

38:17.611 --> 38:19.980
He's gone, Spencer.

38:19.982 --> 38:22.350
Keeping the game going
won't change that.

38:22.352 --> 38:24.935
I know. I just thought

38:24.937 --> 38:26.861
that maybe I could keep
part of him alive

38:26.863 --> 38:29.131
if his last game
never ended.

38:29.133 --> 38:33.701
Neither side will ever win
playing like this.

38:34.730 --> 38:37.732
He hated good-byes.

38:37.734 --> 38:41.282
Gideon also hated
unfinished business.

38:41.284 --> 38:42.717
So...

38:44.514 --> 38:47.934
Let's finish it.

38:49.409 --> 38:51.749
What are you doing?

38:51.751 --> 38:53.920
Moving my rook.

38:53.922 --> 38:55.846
Do you know how
to play chess?

38:56.930 --> 39:00.673
Who do you think Gideon
played before he met you?

39:03.109 --> 39:05.318
I'm probably gonna
finish it in 5 moves.

39:13.543 --> 39:15.751
Check.

39:15.753 --> 39:19.173
Don't hold your breath,
Sonny boy.
