01:07.078 --> 01:08.945
That is disgusting!

01:09.013 --> 01:11.514
Hang on. Here's a spot
that still looks good.

01:12.783 --> 01:15.418
So, do we have a winner?

01:15.486 --> 01:17.354
Hmm...

01:17.422 --> 01:19.156
Not ugly enough.

01:19.224 --> 01:21.193
I want something
that looks like this...

01:21.260 --> 01:22.428
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

01:22.496 --> 01:24.097
...had a baby with this,

01:24.165 --> 01:26.435
and it got sat on by this.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.439
I think I've come up
with the answer.

01:29.507 --> 01:33.274
Oh... my... God!

01:33.339 --> 01:36.603
You never fail
to nauseate me, boy.

01:36.671 --> 01:39.773
Just call me "Barf Simpson."

01:39.840 --> 01:41.407
I wanted to,

01:41.475 --> 01:43.209
but your mother said
kids might tease you.

01:50.918 --> 01:52.853
Half an hour to showtime,
your ugliness.

01:52.921 --> 01:54.088
Dad, do you realize

01:54.155 --> 01:55.756
we've put more time
into this

01:55.824 --> 01:57.825
than all my schoolwork
combined?

01:57.892 --> 02:00.661
But if we win this,
we get a gift certificate.

02:00.728 --> 02:01.895
For what?

02:01.963 --> 02:04.097
It doesn't matter.

02:16.144 --> 02:17.144
How ya doin'?

02:17.212 --> 02:18.746
I need a diaper
for my chimp

02:18.813 --> 02:20.013
that won't upset
my tiger's stomach

02:20.081 --> 02:21.847
if he eats the chimp.

02:21.915 --> 02:24.516
Fear not.
Our chimp diapers have

02:24.584 --> 02:27.919
that nutty cinnamon taste
tigers love.

02:30.121 --> 02:33.657
Mmm!
It's a great time to be a tiger.

02:35.260 --> 02:37.661
Mr. Flanders,
how did you make

02:37.729 --> 02:38.996
these amazing fish?

02:39.063 --> 02:40.931
Actually,
God made some fish

02:40.998 --> 02:42.832
that were pretty
close to these,

02:42.900 --> 02:45.568
so naturally we selected those
for further breeding.

02:45.636 --> 02:49.838
So that natural selection was
the origin of this species?

02:49.906 --> 02:50.873
Yup, that's exactly...

02:50.940 --> 02:52.441
Whoa-oa-oa!

02:52.508 --> 02:54.542
You almost got me.

02:57.413 --> 02:59.847
Not on my watch!

03:11.094 --> 03:12.294
This seat taken?

03:12.361 --> 03:14.095
Uh, yes,
I'm saving it for...

03:14.163 --> 03:15.863
this soy sauce packet.

03:15.931 --> 03:17.565
Aw, man, you know
you're a loser

03:17.633 --> 03:20.167
when they don't even work hard
on the excus

03:20.235 --> 03:22.002
I'll just sit here, then.

03:24.706 --> 03:26.707
Thanks a lot, everyone.

03:26.808 --> 03:28.909
Choke on yourselves.

03:28.977 --> 03:30.978
Ah, here we go.

03:31.045 --> 03:32.879
Oh, no, you don't.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.555
Whoa, that one's so ugly,

03:43.623 --> 03:46.825
it reminds me
of my ex-wife! Hah!

03:50.265 --> 03:51.999
That one reminds me
of her lawyer.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.266
Congress...

03:54.332 --> 03:55.900
elderly drivers...

03:55.968 --> 03:57.335
commercials...

03:57.403 --> 03:59.137
Bella Abzug...

03:59.204 --> 04:01.839
Hey, clown, we've heard
your stand-up!

04:01.907 --> 04:03.540
Now how about
some shut-up!

04:05.175 --> 04:07.309
Everybody's a comedian.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.177
Except you!

04:10.012 --> 04:12.947
Well, why don't <i>you</i> come up here
and try to entertain 'em?

04:13.015 --> 04:14.314
Do it, Moe!
Come on, Moe!

04:14.382 --> 04:15.715
Entertain us!

04:15.783 --> 04:17.350
Well, I guess
I could. Uh...

04:17.418 --> 04:18.851
At least
I'd get a chair.

04:24.157 --> 04:25.256
Check it out.

04:25.323 --> 04:26.257
Two train wrecks
connected

04:26.323 --> 04:27.724
by a strip of leather.

04:29.393 --> 04:31.961
I don't wanna say it's ugly,

04:32.029 --> 04:34.698
but PETA called and said
we should kill this one.

04:36.701 --> 04:38.934
And now, owned by one
of the ugliest families

04:39.002 --> 04:40.235
in Springfield...

04:40.302 --> 04:42.570
Satan's Little Helper!

04:45.577 --> 04:47.211
Oh! Whoa!

04:47.278 --> 04:49.112
Even the Koreans
wouldn't touch this dog!

04:52.717 --> 04:54.984
We have a winner!

04:59.890 --> 05:01.825
Oh...

05:01.892 --> 05:04.861
Ooh, everyone's coming over
to congratulate us!

05:04.928 --> 05:06.695
Humble faces, kids!

05:06.763 --> 05:07.796
Humbler!

05:07.864 --> 05:10.065
Lisa, too humble.

05:12.635 --> 05:13.935
Hmm?!

05:14.002 --> 05:15.069
You're hilarious!

05:15.136 --> 05:16.303
Judge my baby!

05:16.370 --> 05:17.771
Say something cruel
about me!

05:17.839 --> 05:19.805
Would you do
my kid's birthday party?

05:19.873 --> 05:22.006
ALL
Moe! Moe! Moe!

05:22.074 --> 05:24.041
Wow, they love me for my bile.

05:24.108 --> 05:25.808
And I got a spleenful!

05:25.876 --> 05:27.810
Hel-lo!

05:30.714 --> 05:33.351
No, no, no, I don't need your
fair-weather friendship...

05:35.054 --> 05:37.588
...is what I'll say
tomorrow morning!

05:39.708 --> 05:41.376
<i>Man, you sure saved</i>
<i>that dog show.</i>

05:41.444 --> 05:43.311
Moe, you were hilarious.

05:43.379 --> 05:45.312
Ah, I was just doin'
what comes naturally to me;

05:45.380 --> 05:46.780
being mean to animals.

05:46.848 --> 05:50.415
Uh, excuse me, sir.

05:50.483 --> 05:52.284
I was wondering
if you would judge

05:52.352 --> 05:55.388
an outrageous beard contest
I'm in tonight.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.223
Well, uh, anyone can get
a laugh

05:57.291 --> 05:58.725
at the expense
of an ugly dog.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.093
But crazy beards?

06:00.161 --> 06:01.795
That's where
the big boys play.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.429
You got
the gift, baby!
Come on, Moe.

06:03.497 --> 06:05.531
Can you make it sound
like girls askin' me?

06:05.599 --> 06:08.433
Oh, Moe,
please do it! Oh!
Please? Moe, please?

06:08.500 --> 06:11.167
Okay, you crazy
dames, I'll do it!

06:12.769 --> 06:15.503
Which means this joint is closed
for the night.

06:15.571 --> 06:17.071
Don't be that way!
You kidding me?

06:17.139 --> 06:18.405
You can't close!

06:18.473 --> 06:20.507
I'll have to go home
and drink better beer

06:20.575 --> 06:23.676
at half the price
in natural lighting!

06:23.744 --> 06:26.178
I didn't want
to have to do this.

06:30.016 --> 06:32.151
Yeah, that's right!
Scatter, ya cockroaches!

06:32.218 --> 06:35.521
Mr. Szyslak, would you like
to buy some band candy?

06:35.589 --> 06:37.356
That doesn't work
on me.

06:37.424 --> 06:38.657
Oh, yeah?

06:38.725 --> 06:41.692
How 'bout this
scary face?!

06:41.759 --> 06:45.360
I can see that down deep is
a decent man.

06:45.428 --> 06:47.262
Fine.

06:53.436 --> 06:54.436
You're home early!

06:54.504 --> 06:56.271
Oh, can't a guy rush home
from work

06:56.339 --> 06:57.405
to see his beautiful...

06:57.473 --> 06:58.840
Moe's is closed, huh?

06:58.908 --> 06:59.874
Yeah.

06:59.942 --> 07:02.009
Now what
am I supposed to do?

07:02.077 --> 07:03.643
We can enjoy each
others' company.

07:03.711 --> 07:04.644
Okay.

07:06.648 --> 07:08.948
Still wanna be
at Moe's?

07:09.016 --> 07:11.784
She's right, Homer.
You're happier there.

07:11.852 --> 07:14.553
Mr. Szyslak, you want
to buy some band candy?

07:14.621 --> 07:17.724
Even in the thought bubble,
I gotta buy band candy?

07:19.426 --> 07:20.960
Looks like you ate

07:21.028 --> 07:23.459
a Rastafarian, and he's
comin' back up on ya!

07:25.494 --> 07:26.460
Now looky here.

07:26.528 --> 07:28.728
I'm no judge of talent,

07:28.796 --> 07:30.496
but I am a judge
of judging.

07:30.564 --> 07:31.863
And in my judge
judgment,

07:31.931 --> 07:33.765
you have a talent
fojudging talent.

07:33.832 --> 07:36.000
You talk like my ass plays
harmonica.

07:36.067 --> 07:38.535
You should share

07:38.603 --> 07:41.300
your hilarious hate
with everyone!

07:41.368 --> 07:43.904
♪ Why can't you be nicer
to me? ♪

07:49.509 --> 07:52.445
♪ My pride is dying ♪

07:52.512 --> 07:55.113
♪ I think I'm all done
lying, oh... ♪

08:05.988 --> 08:07.656
I didn't see you come in.

08:07.723 --> 08:08.923
Well, since Moe's is
closed again,

08:08.991 --> 08:10.725
I thought I'd help
you cook dinner.

08:10.793 --> 08:12.560
Well, I don't need
much help,

08:12.627 --> 08:15.329
but you can keep me company.

08:18.509 --> 08:19.610
You know what?

08:19.677 --> 08:21.612
I'll just cook this later.

08:24.950 --> 08:26.550
What are we watching?

08:26.618 --> 08:28.185
Uh, I'm gonna go
read a book.

08:31.623 --> 08:33.357
Huh?

08:33.426 --> 08:36.029
After the title page,
it's Bob Dole's memoirs.

08:37.530 --> 08:39.032
This is terrible!

08:39.099 --> 08:41.735
I've seen better stitching on
a baseball glove!

08:41.803 --> 08:43.403
Can I have another corpse?

08:43.471 --> 08:45.305
They weren't corpses.

08:45.373 --> 08:46.639
Uh-oh.

08:49.543 --> 08:51.177
Moe Szyslak?

08:51.244 --> 08:53.245
I'm from U.C.A.A.,
the Uncreative Artists Agency.

08:53.312 --> 08:55.546
We represent some
of the biggest stars on TV.

08:55.614 --> 08:57.281
TV, huh?
That crap still on?

08:57.348 --> 08:59.282
Yes, sir. Never been crappier.

08:59.350 --> 09:01.250
Listen, Moe,
reality shows are
looking for judges,

09:01.318 --> 09:02.452
and you're that
mythical creature

09:02.519 --> 09:04.153
we thought we would
never find:

09:04.221 --> 09:06.288
you're mean, you're funny
and you're not British!

09:06.355 --> 09:07.689
I am <i>so</i> not British.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.424
Don't let this pasty face
and bad teeth fool ya.

09:10.492 --> 09:11.325
Perfect!

09:11.392 --> 09:12.926
So, what kind of reality shows

09:12.993 --> 09:14.127
are we talkin' about here?

09:14.194 --> 09:15.627
Well, to name
just a few:

09:15.695 --> 09:17.695
<i>America's Ripest Bananas,</i>
<i>So You Think You Can Judge,</i>

09:17.763 --> 09:19.999
<i>Who Wants to be a Welder?</i>
<i>Poodle Versus Elephant...</i>

09:20.067 --> 09:22.602

<i>American Idol,</i>
<i>Dancing With Cars of the Stars,</i>

09:24.872 --> 09:27.207
<i>America's Drunkest Nobody,</i>
<i>Let's Make a Veal...</i>

09:27.275 --> 09:28.041
Love that show.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.642
<i>Somali Pirate Apprentice.</i>

09:29.710 --> 09:30.810
Right, yeah,
with those guys.

09:30.878 --> 09:31.811
<i>Fix Andy Dick.</i>

09:31.879 --> 09:33.045
It's about time.

09:33.113 --> 09:34.848
<i>Bottom Chef,</i>
<i>My Life On Kathy Griffin,</i>

09:34.915 --> 09:37.184
<i>Pimp My Crypt, Are You Fatter</i>
<i>Than a Fifth Grader?</i>

09:37.252 --> 09:39.019
and <i>Grave Robbers</i>
<i>of Orange County.</i>

09:39.086 --> 09:40.654
Geez, that's, uh,
quite a list.

09:40.721 --> 09:42.222
Hang on.
I'm getting a text.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.524
Ooh, those were all
just canceled,

09:43.591 --> 09:44.792
except for <i>American Idol.</i>

09:44.859 --> 09:45.993
Did you just say
<i>"Armenian Idol"?</i>

09:46.061 --> 09:47.160
'Cause that's my favorite show!

09:47.226 --> 09:48.893
No, no, no, no, no,
<i>American Idol.</i>

09:48.960 --> 09:49.993
Oh, yeah.

09:50.060 --> 09:51.392
Who's their Egor Glumov?

09:51.460 --> 09:52.459
Randy Jackson.

09:52.527 --> 09:53.827
Ah, good enough.

10:01.347 --> 10:03.248
Uh, hey, driver,
could you put on a song

10:03.315 --> 10:05.183
about California
or Los Angeles?

10:05.251 --> 10:06.451
Ah, they all suck.

10:06.519 --> 10:08.888
But here's a great one
about Alabama!

10:08.956 --> 10:14.128
♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

10:14.196 --> 10:18.564
♪ Where the skies are so blue ♪

10:18.631 --> 10:23.333
♪ Sweet home Alabama ♪

10:23.401 --> 10:26.605
♪ Lord, I'm coming home
to you. ♪

10:33.812 --> 10:35.446
Now that I have
all this free time,

10:35.514 --> 10:37.515
I thought I would do you
a huge favor.

10:37.582 --> 10:38.649
That's nice.

10:38.717 --> 10:39.884
What kind of favor?

10:39.951 --> 10:41.919
I organized
the kitchen.

10:41.986 --> 10:44.921
I labeled everything
with a labelmaker...

10:44.988 --> 10:49.657
and I mixed all the spices
together into one super spice!

10:54.029 --> 10:56.797
Oh-oh, what kind
of ventilating is that?

10:56.865 --> 10:58.165
Hyper!

11:05.537 --> 11:06.837
Wow, Marge,

11:06.904 --> 11:09.706
I can't believe you're
taking me to a sports bar.

11:09.773 --> 11:13.877
Well, it's been such a blessing
having you around the house.

11:13.944 --> 11:16.846
Making my life easier,
as you so put it.

11:16.914 --> 11:18.881
So I thought you
deserved a reward.

11:28.091 --> 11:29.691
Watching hockey.

11:29.759 --> 11:31.493
Watching them
pass that puck.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.694
Oh, yeah.

11:32.761 --> 11:34.695
Lacrosse, idiot.

11:34.763 --> 11:37.498
Hey, man, can you
settle a bet?

11:37.566 --> 11:39.700
What was the
greatest XFL team

11:39.768 --> 11:41.603
that never won
a championship?

11:41.670 --> 11:44.440
Uh, the Long Island
Iced Teas?

11:44.508 --> 11:46.643
I think you want the gay bar
across the street.

11:50.844 --> 11:54.245
As an eight-year-old girl
in 21st-century America,

11:54.313 --> 11:57.615
I know how it is to feel
insecure about your looks.

11:57.682 --> 11:59.917
But you've got so much
going for you.

11:59.985 --> 12:02.052
I'd kill for your
sense of smell.

12:02.120 --> 12:03.921
You have a nice firm handshake.

12:03.988 --> 12:07.357
And when you wag your tail,
it really lights up a room.

12:07.424 --> 12:09.559
Now let's scoot together.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.900
Wow, I can't believe I'm here.

12:18.967 --> 12:21.335
The place where magic is made.

12:23.170 --> 12:25.838
I really appreciate you
showing me around, Simon.

12:25.905 --> 12:27.339
Always happy to
help the newbies.

12:27.406 --> 12:28.573
And how do you like L.A.?

12:28.641 --> 12:30.142
Oh, it's a helluva city.

12:30.210 --> 12:32.111
It's like somebody
stepped on New York

12:32.179 --> 12:33.746
and scraped it off
on the beach.

12:33.814 --> 12:34.814
Clever.

12:34.882 --> 12:35.848
Slightly nasty.

12:35.916 --> 12:37.416
Very impressive.

12:37.484 --> 12:39.218
You know, I don't say
this often, Moe,

12:39.285 --> 12:41.385
but I actually think you're
quite good at this.

12:42.754 --> 12:45.356
Oh, well... Oh, nuts.

12:45.423 --> 12:46.658
Here come the paparazzi.

12:57.968 --> 13:00.803
Homie, I thought you
were at that sports bar.

13:00.871 --> 13:03.772
Well, that place was for
die-hard sports fans.

13:03.840 --> 13:05.507
Not guys like me, who are

13:05.575 --> 13:07.876
only fans when their team
makes the playoffs.

13:07.944 --> 13:11.045
So I decided to take
apart the washing machine

13:11.113 --> 13:13.281
to see where that penny
I left in my pants went.

13:13.348 --> 13:16.451
Well, I am glad you're
spending more time with us,

13:16.518 --> 13:19.219
but maybe you should get a
plumber to help you with that.

13:19.287 --> 13:20.988
Oh, those guys
are all crooks.

13:21.055 --> 13:23.623
They charge you for
parts and labor?

13:23.691 --> 13:24.891
Pick one, buddy.

13:24.959 --> 13:27.293
I can do this
just fine by myself.

13:29.229 --> 13:30.763
Don't worry, I got it.

13:42.076 --> 13:44.909
Sure is hell to have
your husband around all
the time, ain't it?

13:44.977 --> 13:47.708
At least in hell,
the heat still works.

13:47.776 --> 13:51.881
Well, I do know something
that could occupy his time.

13:51.949 --> 13:53.649
A lot of his time.

13:53.717 --> 13:56.451
Seen it work with plenty
of men my age.

13:56.519 --> 13:59.588
Only thing is,
you may not get him back.

13:59.655 --> 14:00.755
What is it?

14:00.823 --> 14:02.589
Golf.

14:04.925 --> 14:06.725
Hey there, neighbor.

14:06.793 --> 14:08.893
You look as puffed up
as a peacock in a...

14:14.165 --> 14:16.200
Golf it is.

14:16.268 --> 14:17.501
Golf what is?

14:19.571 --> 14:22.073
Uh, you wanted
to see me, Simon?

14:22.140 --> 14:23.707
Moe, as you know,

14:23.775 --> 14:26.177
over the past few days I've
grown rather fond of you.

14:26.244 --> 14:28.479
I can't believe you gave
me your home phone number.

14:28.547 --> 14:30.114
That's not my home number.

14:30.182 --> 14:32.283
That's my assistant's
work number.

14:32.351 --> 14:34.652
Now, Moe, I want to give you
a friendly warning--

14:34.720 --> 14:36.755
don't do what I did.

14:36.822 --> 14:38.924
Don't become the mean judge.

14:38.991 --> 14:40.925
But it's brought you everything
a man could want.

14:40.993 --> 14:43.124
Uh, I bet you throw out
your paper plates

14:43.192 --> 14:45.190
instead of reusing them
till the food drops through.

14:45.258 --> 14:46.992
That's true. Everything
you said is true.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.126
But there's a cost.

14:48.194 --> 14:49.460
I'm lonely, Moe.

14:49.528 --> 14:51.195
No one dares to be my friend,

14:51.262 --> 14:52.762
for fear I'll say
something nasty.

14:52.830 --> 14:54.798
But what we do is just
kiddin' around, right?

14:54.865 --> 14:56.132
People know that.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.734
Do they?

14:57.801 --> 14:59.168
They've been preparing
a bio of you,

14:59.236 --> 15:00.736
with interviews of
people you've judged.

15:00.804 --> 15:02.038
Let's have a look.

15:02.106 --> 15:03.906
He's the meanest
man in town.

15:03.974 --> 15:05.041
Nasty.

15:05.109 --> 15:06.575
Uncouth.

15:06.643 --> 15:08.077
We hate you.

15:08.144 --> 15:09.712
So does Stu.

15:09.780 --> 15:12.315
Edit that so it
rhymes with something.

15:12.382 --> 15:17.021
He's a...

15:17.088 --> 15:19.389
Wow, I can't believe
this, Simon.

15:19.457 --> 15:20.656
Simon?

15:20.724 --> 15:22.157
Huh.

15:22.225 --> 15:24.192
Was he really here, or was it
just my imagination?

15:24.260 --> 15:25.727
I'm here.

15:25.795 --> 15:27.862
My black tee shirt makes me
blend into the shadows.

15:27.930 --> 15:29.764
I'm here, I'm gone.

15:29.832 --> 15:32.867
I'm here, I'm gone.
I'm here, I'm gone.

15:32.935 --> 15:35.337
I'm here.
I get it. I get it.
That-That's your thing.

15:37.928 --> 15:44.333
♪ Happy birthday to... ♪

15:44.401 --> 15:46.401
♪ You! ♪

15:49.569 --> 15:51.169
This is it, Moe--

15:51.236 --> 15:54.671
America's going to learn
just what sort of man you are.

15:54.739 --> 15:57.506
Okay, Randy, what'd you
think of that performance?

15:57.574 --> 15:59.041
A'ight, a'ight, you know what?

15:59.108 --> 16:00.542
I was feelin' that, dawg.

16:00.609 --> 16:01.843
"Happy" was very cool, right?

16:01.910 --> 16:03.711
But "birth" was definitely
a little pitchy.

16:03.779 --> 16:06.552
But I gotta tell you something,
you worked it out on "day," man.

16:06.619 --> 16:09.756
And then when you hit that "to
you", dude, that was the bomb.

16:09.824 --> 16:11.725
You blew out
all the candles, baby.

16:11.792 --> 16:14.393
If you think that
answer was a yes,

16:14.461 --> 16:16.361
text the number at
the bottom of the screen

16:16.428 --> 16:18.561
Giant secret charges

16:18.629 --> 16:20.962
I have to admit, I dn't think
you could comeack

16:21.030 --> 16:22.963
from last week, when your
version of "Brown Sugar"

16:23.031 --> 16:25.032
made Mick Jagger
retire from singing rever.

16:25.099 --> 16:26.500
But you rocked it.

16:26.567 --> 16:28.601
Ellen, what's your
"ramble" on this?

16:28.669 --> 16:30.670
Ryan, I don't ramble anymore.

16:30.738 --> 16:33.204
Although Ive that
song "Ramblin' Man" by
The Allman Brothers.

16:33.272 --> 16:35.540
I used to think that they were
"The Almond Brothe,"

16:35.607 --> 16:37.007
which was ol,
because I love nuts.

16:37.075 --> 16:38.775
Except for filberts,
which is weird

16:38.843 --> 16:40.209
because I love Dilbert--

16:40.277 --> 16:41.911
'cause when you're stuck
workinin a cubicle,

16:41.978 --> 16:44.247
sometimes you just gotta dance.

♪

16:53.422 --> 16:56.689
Now let's hear from
the new guy, Moe Szyslak.

16:59.325 --> 17:01.325
Uh... Well, let's
see here, um..

17:03.995 --> 17:06.996
Don't become the mean judge.

17:07.064 --> 17:09.298
Mr. Cowellwould you
likee band candy?

17:09.366 --> 17:10.467
Security.

17:13.909 --> 17:15.509
Uh, I'm afraid

17:15.577 --> 17:17.643
you're wasting your
time on this stage.

17:20.613 --> 17:22.882
...because you should be
on Broadway

17:22.950 --> 17:24.784
chargin' a hundred
bucks a ticket.

17:24.852 --> 17:26.051
You're a natural talent.

17:27.521 --> 17:29.055
I'm gettin' a
little emotional here,

17:29.122 --> 17:31.723
because your voice, it opened
up a little part of me

17:31.791 --> 17:34.693
that I thought was closed
to truth and beauty forever.

17:34.761 --> 17:36.995
If there's a God,
I just hope that right now

17:37.063 --> 17:39.998
he's votin' your name
on that 8-8-8 line.

17:40.066 --> 17:41.566
It was, it was really beautiful.

17:41.634 --> 17:42.634
Really. Thank you.

17:43.836 --> 17:46.604
Okay, that's four thumbs up.

17:46.672 --> 17:49.107
And finally, because this
show now has more judges

17:49.175 --> 17:51.842
than the Supreme Court...
Simon, what do you say?

17:51.910 --> 17:54.411
Well, that was a truly a
remarkable version of
"Happy Birthday."

17:54.479 --> 17:55.813
Because when it was done,

17:55.881 --> 17:58.649
I actually felt like I had
lost a year of my life.

18:00.886 --> 18:04.956
But even more objectionable
were Moe's insipid comments,

18:05.024 --> 18:07.225
a desperate plea
for affection,

18:07.293 --> 18:10.095
which fell as flat as
the hair on my head.

18:13.966 --> 18:15.032
Why are you raggin' on me?

18:15.100 --> 18:16.966
I'm just doin'
what you said.

18:17.034 --> 18:18.499
Hmm. Let me think.

18:18.567 --> 18:20.930
Why would I try to
sabotage a new judge

18:20.998 --> 18:23.630
who just might do what I
do for $48 million less?

18:23.698 --> 18:24.763
Hey, hey, hey.

18:24.831 --> 18:26.363
I've been double-crossed here.

18:26.430 --> 18:28.062
You're pretty smart huh, Simon?

18:28.130 --> 18:31.062
Let's see how smart you are with
your voice box hangin' out.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.831
Label to camera.
Label to camera.

18:33.899 --> 18:35.867
What? Oh. Sorry. Sorry.

18:35.934 --> 18:37.835
Die, ya bastard.

18:39.471 --> 18:41.838
Tees, scorecard,
stubby little pencil.

18:41.906 --> 18:42.973
You're all set.

18:43.041 --> 18:44.807
Have fun, Homie.

18:44.873 --> 18:45.973
Looks like Jimmy's

18:46.040 --> 18:48.108
starting him off
with a three iron.

18:48.175 --> 18:50.376
My first shot was
with a three iron.

18:50.444 --> 18:52.011
One shot, and I was
hooked for life.

18:52.079 --> 18:54.680
Barely saw my family again.

18:54.748 --> 18:57.581
Birthdays, anniversaries,
I missed 'em all.

19:00.084 --> 19:02.685
I'm missing my daughr's
wedding right now.

19:02.753 --> 19:05.121
Sweet guy, I'm told.

19:05.189 --> 19:06.656
One shot.

19:06.724 --> 19:08.592
Hooked for life.

19:12.531 --> 19:13.831
Huh?!

19:13.899 --> 19:16.402
Marge, you ruined my shot.

19:16.469 --> 19:19.570
You can take another,
in 40 years.

19:23.208 --> 19:25.007
That was awesome.

19:25.075 --> 19:27.877
I feel like the
Tiger Woods of sex.

19:27.944 --> 19:30.179
In the mood for
another round?

19:34.984 --> 19:36.451
I didn't rip out
his voice box,

19:36.518 --> 19:38.352
but I did stretch out
his tee shirt.

19:38.420 --> 19:41.288
Then they said I ain't allowed
back in California no more

19:41.356 --> 19:43.824
and I can no longer make
judgments about nothin'.

19:43.891 --> 19:46.994
Hey, Moe, am I
okay to drive?

19:47.062 --> 19:48.697
Legally, I can't say.

19:48.764 --> 19:50.933
To a drunk man,
that's a yes.

19:57.408 --> 19:58.675
Beep, beep.

19:58.743 --> 19:59.843
He seems fine.

19:59.910 --> 20:01.311
There is one bright side:

20:01.379 --> 20:03.780
I'm also forbidden
from ever watching Fox.

20:03.848 --> 20:05.915
You can't even show it
in the bar?

20:05.983 --> 20:08.751
That's right, and business
has never been better.

20:12.552 --> 20:15.922
Oh, hey, how's it
goin' there, Mr. Murdoch?

20:15.990 --> 20:18.959
Never mind me-- put on
<i>The Jay Leno Show.</i>

20:19.026 --> 20:20.694
Have you seen this?

20:20.761 --> 20:23.063
The president says
Iran has gotten ahold

20:23.130 --> 20:24.897
of the most dangerous weapon
known to man:

20:24.965 --> 20:26.499
The BP oil rig.

20:26.566 --> 20:27.733
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen.

20:27.801 --> 20:29.435
But I know how to make
that leak disappear:

20:29.502 --> 20:30.569
put it on NBC.
