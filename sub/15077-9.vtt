UNTIL SOMETHING
TRULY AWFUL HAPPENS.

40:03.036 --> 40:05.438
WHAT ARE YOU
ASKING ME TO DO?

40:07.240 --> 40:10.443
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

41:23.249 --> 41:25.051
OH, MY GOD.

41:26.286 --> 41:27.721
WHAT --

41:27.754 --> 41:29.723
HOW DID HE NOT
TEST POSITIVE?

41:30.990 --> 41:34.194
"TAKE 4 HOURS
BEFORE TESTING."

41:34.227 --> 41:36.229
PLAYERS CALL THAT A FLUSH.

41:36.262 --> 41:39.132
IT REMOVES ALL TRACES OF DRUGS
FROM THE SYSTEM.

41:39.165 --> 41:40.900
RIGHT.

41:40.934 --> 41:42.035
DR. TURNER.

41:43.269 --> 41:45.705
HMM.

41:45.739 --> 41:48.141
TERRENCE IS IN DEEP, NICO.

41:48.174 --> 41:48.274
I KNOW.
