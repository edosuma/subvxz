01:09.247 --> 01:11.238
Please take notes.

01:12.050 --> 01:15.542
No wounds on the body to indicate
foul play from a weapon of any sort.

01:15.721 --> 01:20.317
<i>The contents of the safe are intact,</i>
<i>thus ruling out robbery as a motive.</i>

01:20.492 --> 01:22.687
<i>The science of fingerprinting</i>
<i>has determined...</i>

01:22.861 --> 01:25.887
<i>...there are no prints but the victim's</i>
<i>on the doorknob and frame...</i>

01:26.064 --> 01:28.157
<i>...to indicate anyone else</i>
<i>entered or left.</i>

01:28.333 --> 01:30.528
The window is latched shut
from the inside.

01:30.702 --> 01:32.636
<i>So no one entered or left by that route...</i>

01:32.804 --> 01:35.068
<i>...thus ruling out homicide</i>
<i>as a cause of death.</i>

01:35.240 --> 01:39.006
There's no indication of whiskey in
the glass or on the breath of the deceased.

01:39.177 --> 01:41.202
No carpet fibers
on the soles of her shoes.

01:41.380 --> 01:45.009
<i>So she never set foot on the carpet.</i>
<i>There is a scuff on her right shoe tip...</i>

01:45.183 --> 01:46.480
<i>...where polish was removed.</i>

01:46.652 --> 01:50.088
<i>There is traces of the same polish</i>
<i>on this upturned bit of carpet.</i>

01:50.255 --> 01:54.817
There are traces of flower pollen
on the edges of the nostril.

01:55.894 --> 01:59.455
I therefore conclude
from the evidence gathered...

01:59.898 --> 02:02.765
<i>...that the deceased entered the room</i>
<i>with a bunch of flowers.</i>

02:02.934 --> 02:05.164
<i>She placed the flowers</i>
<i>in the vase by the door.</i>

02:05.337 --> 02:08.864
<i>She took the vase in one hand, along</i>
<i>with the whiskey tumbler in the other...</i>

02:09.041 --> 02:11.407
<i>...went across the room</i>
<i>to the decanter of whiskey...</i>

02:11.576 --> 02:13.567
<i>...let the flowers get too close</i>
<i>to her nose.</i>

02:13.745 --> 02:16.407
<i>She sneezed, her left foot</i>
<i>involuntarily slipped forward...</i>

02:16.581 --> 02:18.640
<i>...caught the tip of her shoe</i>
<i>on this carpet...</i>

02:18.817 --> 02:22.082
...tripped, hit her head on the floor,
died from shock of the brain.

02:22.254 --> 02:25.485
In other words, it was not foul play
that killed this poor woman...

02:25.657 --> 02:29.525
...but an accident
caused by a simple sneeze.

02:30.228 --> 02:32.788
And, in fact, it is not a woman at all...

02:32.964 --> 02:37.765
...but a man wearing a horse-haired wig.

02:56.888 --> 02:58.719
Oh, Quentin, I'm so proud.

02:58.890 --> 03:01.916
-You know what this means, Clarissa?
-Yes, that we can get married.

03:02.094 --> 03:04.392
It means science has a place
in police work.

03:05.731 --> 03:09.929
I proved it. I convinced
each and every one of them.

03:10.102 --> 03:12.502
Now there's only one more person
you have to convince.

03:12.771 --> 03:15.706
I'm convinced.
But you must remember, Mr. Jackson...

03:15.874 --> 03:18.434
...if we don't own the land
within 90 days...

03:18.610 --> 03:22.740
...the railroad will go to other banks
to finance their expansion.

03:22.914 --> 03:24.848
No worries, Mr. Ashe.

03:25.016 --> 03:28.782
In 90 days, we'll be laying track
right through the middle of Mexico City.

03:41.366 --> 03:42.765
Go.

03:43.502 --> 03:44.628
That's a good one.

03:48.673 --> 03:49.799
You do better.

03:49.975 --> 03:52.535
How could you sell the mortgage
on my farm to the gringos?

03:52.711 --> 03:55.305
Pedro, we have no choice.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.778
The big American banks
control the cash flow.

03:57.949 --> 03:59.974
And through the cash flow,
they control us.

04:00.152 --> 04:01.449
Don Diego's doing all he can.

04:01.620 --> 04:03.781
I'm sure Don Diego is.

04:03.955 --> 04:08.585
But I've worked my whole life
to leave something to my poor daughter.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.558
All she knows is the farm life.

04:11.930 --> 04:13.295
What will become of her?

04:26.578 --> 04:28.910
You cheated. I wasn't concentrating.

04:32.050 --> 04:33.449
Best of three.

04:42.994 --> 04:46.088
-Let me talk to Bernardo.
-Bernardo just follows orders.

04:46.932 --> 04:50.595
So, what are we supposed to do, Papa,
stand by and let them steal our land?

04:50.769 --> 04:54.535
Unless some higher authority
intercedes....

04:55.874 --> 04:57.535
Maria, where are you going?

04:57.709 --> 04:59.040
To see the higher authority.

05:30.242 --> 05:32.233
Up. Up.

05:49.227 --> 05:52.287
The spitting image of her mother,
God rest her soul.

05:52.464 --> 05:54.489
My condolences, Don Diego.

05:54.799 --> 05:56.266
Twenty years she's gone now.

05:56.434 --> 05:58.527
Well, she left you
a very beautiful daughter.

05:58.703 --> 06:02.662
Who I haven't seen in most of the 1 0 years
she's been away at school in Europe.

06:03.308 --> 06:06.607
-Left a girl, came home a woman.
-Indeed.

06:07.712 --> 06:10.738
My only problem now
is trying to convince her to stay.

06:10.916 --> 06:13.680
She's been home for a week,
and already she wants to go back.

06:18.890 --> 06:21.188
-I want to see Don Diego.
-He can't be disturbed.

06:21.359 --> 06:23.554
Neither can I. And I am.
Very disturbed.

06:23.728 --> 06:26.196
He is meeting
with a very important person.

06:26.364 --> 06:29.561
Don Diego has always said,
"Every client is a very important person."

06:29.734 --> 06:32.202
This is not a client, Maria.

06:32.370 --> 06:35.134
This is a gentleman
from The Bank of New York.

06:36.007 --> 06:37.872
I knew it.

06:42.447 --> 06:43.675
Gotta pay the toll.

06:58.296 --> 07:01.629
May I present Mr. Jackson from
the Capital Bank and Trust of <i>Nueva York.</i>

07:01.800 --> 07:03.062
How do you do, Mr. Jackson?

07:03.234 --> 07:07.295
Infinitely better in your presence
than I do out of it, Señorita Sandoval.

07:09.307 --> 07:10.740
Afternoon tea. How civilized.

07:10.909 --> 07:13.707
Are you surprised to find
that we are civilized, Mr. Jackson?

07:13.878 --> 07:15.470
No, not at all.

07:15.647 --> 07:17.444
No, I find it charming.

07:17.615 --> 07:18.980
Charming?

07:19.217 --> 07:21.048
I presume if you are using
such a word...

07:21.219 --> 07:25.178
...that you've never experienced
the pleasure of an afternoon tea.

07:25.357 --> 07:28.224
Mr. Jackson's bank has agreed
to provide us...

07:28.393 --> 07:31.294
...with the capital we need
to continue with what we are doing.

07:31.529 --> 07:33.963
We were just going over the papers.

07:35.300 --> 07:39.794
A big New York bank taking an interest
in our small Mexican bank?

07:40.138 --> 07:42.129
Why is that, Mr. Jackson?

07:42.307 --> 07:45.743
Well, if you can't help friends
in a time of need, who can you help?

07:46.211 --> 07:48.941
Pardon me, but in Europe
we have a different perspective...

07:49.114 --> 07:51.275
...on the American definition
of friendship.

07:51.449 --> 07:54.350
Forgive my ignorance, señorita,
but I'm a little uninformed...

07:54.519 --> 07:56.282
...on the European perspective.

07:56.454 --> 08:00.151
But I'm always willing to learn.
In fact, I'd be delighted...

08:00.325 --> 08:03.351
...if you would enlighten me
on that subject, perhaps over dinner?

08:03.528 --> 08:05.655
Perhaps some other time.
I need to get up early.

08:05.830 --> 08:07.058
I have a long ride tomorrow.

08:07.232 --> 08:08.631
Checkmate.

08:15.040 --> 08:16.268
Goodbye, Mr. Jackson.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.901
Men. All they have is one thing
on their minds.

08:20.078 --> 08:22.205
And, by the way, that includes you.

08:22.647 --> 08:26.242
Please. I've seen how you look
at that little filly of Señor Gomez.

08:26.418 --> 08:27.885
A little more.

08:28.153 --> 08:29.848
A little more.

08:45.937 --> 08:47.234
Stay here.

08:49.541 --> 08:51.736
Don't talk to anybody.

09:18.903 --> 09:19.995
Excuse me.

09:20.171 --> 09:21.934
Excuse me.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.437
What was that?
Is there a problem?

09:24.776 --> 09:26.038
For me? No.

09:26.211 --> 09:28.179
For the horse
that gets poked in the side...

09:28.346 --> 09:30.837
...with metal every time
you want him to do something...

09:31.015 --> 09:32.983
...for him, I'm sure it's a problem.

09:33.852 --> 09:36.286
Of course, he's probably
too polite to say anything.

09:36.454 --> 09:38.820
Well, certainly more polite than you.

09:38.990 --> 09:42.187
But, anyway, thank you for your opinion,
misinformed as it is.

09:42.360 --> 09:44.760
Perhaps you can tell me
what you're doing in my house.

09:44.929 --> 09:46.157
Oh, so you are the daughter.

09:46.331 --> 09:49.391
-Yes, I am the daughter. And you are?
-Maria Alvarez.

09:49.567 --> 09:52.968
-Do you work for us, Maria Alvarez?
-No, I do not work for you.

09:53.138 --> 09:56.073
-Then what are you doing here?
-I have business with your father.

09:58.610 --> 10:01.841
-And what sort of business, may I ask?
-Private business.

10:02.413 --> 10:03.402
Hey.

10:04.716 --> 10:06.684
Hey, stop. Hey.

10:07.785 --> 10:09.184
Maria.

10:09.354 --> 10:10.912
Maria.

10:23.001 --> 10:24.229
I knew it.

10:24.402 --> 10:28.031
You help the gringos steal our land.
You betray your own people.

10:28.540 --> 10:29.939
How dare you accuse me.

10:30.108 --> 10:31.871
Get her out of here.
Have her arrested.

10:32.043 --> 10:35.410
Traitor. Thief.
You're gonna pay for this.

10:36.281 --> 10:37.270
I'm sorry.

10:37.448 --> 10:39.678
They are stealing our land.

10:39.851 --> 10:41.512
Don Diego is a traitor.

10:42.687 --> 10:45.349
Don Diego is a traitor.

10:49.093 --> 10:51.687
-The future.
-To the future.

11:06.411 --> 11:07.400
Are you lost?

11:07.779 --> 11:09.303
Mr. Alvarez, Pedro...

11:09.480 --> 11:12.313
...you're delinquent
in your loan payments.

11:12.483 --> 11:16.044
How can I pay when the interest
is more than I earn?

11:16.221 --> 11:18.655
Says in this agreement
that if you're in arrears...

11:19.057 --> 11:23.426
...we have the right to foreclose
and purchase this property for one peso.

11:27.599 --> 11:29.464
Over my dead body.

11:29.634 --> 11:30.896
No problem.

11:37.909 --> 11:41.470
There's your receipt, Mr. Alvarez, Pedro.

11:42.146 --> 11:43.636
Burn it.

11:55.526 --> 11:57.858
You should have locked them up,
not me.

11:58.596 --> 12:02.157
-They did not break into someone's house.
-No, they are doing worse.

12:02.333 --> 12:05.530
You want my advice, Maria?
You should stop trying to change the world.

12:05.703 --> 12:10.606
You want my advice, Gustavo?
You should start trying to change the world.

12:13.011 --> 12:14.308
Eat.

12:20.685 --> 12:23.381
The poultice that will help
your horse's hoof.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.884
Thank you.

12:27.859 --> 12:30.521
Now who's gonna be outside?

12:33.498 --> 12:35.022
Keep an eye on her.

12:38.670 --> 12:41.969
-What are you doing here?
-Hey, old man, read this.

12:42.140 --> 12:44.301
-What's this?
-This is for you.

12:44.475 --> 12:46.841
You haven't been making
your payments to the bank.

12:47.011 --> 12:48.808
We have a right to foreclose.

12:48.980 --> 12:52.746
I've given you everything you're gonna
get from me. Now get out.

13:32.156 --> 13:35.091
Papa? Papa?

13:36.227 --> 13:37.854
Papa.

13:40.565 --> 13:41.862
Maria.

14:00.385 --> 14:03.115
Papa. Papa?

14:03.354 --> 14:04.514
Papa?

14:04.689 --> 14:07.556
Somebody, please go get a doctor.

14:07.725 --> 14:10.421
-What did you do to him?
-I didn't do anything.

14:10.595 --> 14:14.031
-We were finishing the arrangements--
-You killed him.

14:14.198 --> 14:15.790
You killed my father.

14:15.967 --> 14:18.265
Señorita,
he's evidently had a heart attack.

14:18.436 --> 14:19.767
No.

14:19.937 --> 14:21.165
He was--

14:21.339 --> 14:23.307
He was healthy.

14:23.474 --> 14:26.272
You did something to him.
I know you did.

14:26.477 --> 14:31.676
I know this is a terrible shock for you,
but you need to try and remain calm.

14:31.849 --> 14:33.817
In fact, I think you need to sit down.

14:35.119 --> 14:36.916
Grief is intense, I understand that.

14:37.088 --> 14:39.921
But if you can,
let's review the situation calmly.

14:40.491 --> 14:43.392
Your father's dead. Everything that
belonged to him is now mine.

14:43.561 --> 14:46.359
In your mistaken belief
that I had something to do with it...

14:46.531 --> 14:48.658
...you've attacked me.
You're trying to kill me.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.428
My natural reaction is self-defense.

14:51.602 --> 14:53.763
Before we can stop this,
I'll shoot you dead.

14:54.338 --> 14:56.772
But it doesn't have to end that way.

14:59.577 --> 15:01.101
Look at that, darling.

15:02.146 --> 15:04.011
It's choosing time.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.119
That's it.

15:19.764 --> 15:22.028
Well, I guess we've got a deal.

15:23.201 --> 15:26.534
If you don't mind,
I need to go to my room.

15:26.971 --> 15:28.962
I must lie down.

15:29.140 --> 15:32.803
This is all too much for me at once.
You understand?

15:34.579 --> 15:36.103
Yes.

15:36.280 --> 15:38.407
Absolutely.

15:38.583 --> 15:40.278
I understand.

15:43.221 --> 15:45.018
You take all the time you need.

15:49.160 --> 15:51.720
Don't worry about a thing.

15:52.597 --> 15:54.656
I'll make all the arrangements.

16:05.276 --> 16:06.834
Oh, darling?

16:08.346 --> 16:11.179
Would you like your afternoon tea...

16:11.349 --> 16:13.613
...sent up to your room?

16:16.387 --> 16:19.117
That would be very nice. Thank you.

16:40.111 --> 16:42.102
-Hey. Hey.
-Get back here.

16:42.280 --> 16:43.804
Come back here, you bitch.

16:44.882 --> 16:46.850
-Come back.
-Hey. Come here.

16:53.224 --> 16:54.384
I got you now.

17:30.161 --> 17:31.958
Goddamn it.

17:54.685 --> 17:56.949
-Padre.
-Maria?

17:59.223 --> 18:00.622
They shot him.

18:00.791 --> 18:04.192
I know, my child. I know.

18:25.583 --> 18:27.608
What do you want from me, huh?

18:27.785 --> 18:30.151
I have nothing to give you. Nothing.

18:31.088 --> 18:33.955
You should have eaten
while you had the chance.

19:16.901 --> 19:18.596
Get out of here. Shoo.

19:44.395 --> 19:46.454
Hands up.

19:46.630 --> 19:47.892
No one--

19:48.365 --> 19:49.662
Move.

19:58.175 --> 20:00.040
What are you doing?

20:00.878 --> 20:03.904
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm taking this bank.

20:04.915 --> 20:06.940
-With an unloaded gun?
-How do you know?

20:07.151 --> 20:08.982
When a gun doesn't have any bullets--

20:09.153 --> 20:12.088
Doesn't matter.
This bank is taken. Find another one.

20:12.256 --> 20:15.054
This is the only bank in town.
Besides, it's my father's.

20:15.226 --> 20:16.955
And take that raggedy mask off.

20:17.128 --> 20:19.562
It doesn't even match.
Everyone knows who you are.

20:19.730 --> 20:22.255
Your mask isn't silly?
People won't recognize that voice?

20:22.433 --> 20:24.731
-"This is my father's bank."
-It is my father's.

20:24.902 --> 20:26.767
Get out of my way.
I need to finish my job.

20:26.937 --> 20:30.338
-Señoritas?
-I would hardly call stealing a job.

20:30.541 --> 20:32.668
Señoritas?

20:32.843 --> 20:34.640
I am not stealing.

20:34.812 --> 20:37.542
I am taking it back from the bastards
who murdered my father.

20:37.982 --> 20:40.007
-They killed Don Diego?
-Señoritas.

20:40.184 --> 20:41.617
What?

20:41.786 --> 20:44.516
The first order of business
is that we're gonna secure...

20:44.688 --> 20:46.553
...and then remove all the deposits.

20:46.724 --> 20:49.352
And then we're gonna instill
some renewed confidence in it.

20:49.527 --> 20:52.325
I'd like to see the Stars and Stripes
flying over this place...

20:52.496 --> 20:55.624
...so things start to look
a little more American down here.

20:58.402 --> 21:00.267
Señor Manager?

21:01.138 --> 21:03.538
This establishment is now
a wholly-owned subsidiary...

21:03.707 --> 21:06.267
...of the Capital Bank and Trust
of New York.

21:06.610 --> 21:08.134
What do you say we open the vault?

21:08.579 --> 21:12.879
Take a look, and see what kind of cash
is on hand in the liquid-assets department.

21:14.218 --> 21:16.311
Excuse me. Where is the vault?

21:17.922 --> 21:19.184
In Don Diego's office.

21:19.356 --> 21:23.292
Well, I guess that would be Señor Jackson's
office now, wouldn't it?

21:36.307 --> 21:37.899
<i>We did it. We did it.</i>

21:38.209 --> 21:40.404
We did it. We did it.

21:43.914 --> 21:46.348
-We did it.
-And what is it that you think you did?

21:46.517 --> 21:48.849
Look. We're gonna help a lot of people.

21:49.019 --> 21:50.111
To really help...

21:50.287 --> 21:53.688
...you'd have to reverse the massive theft
of property that has taken place.

21:54.091 --> 21:58.027
Listen, do you know how many
kilos of rice we can buy with this?

21:58.195 --> 22:00.720
We can feed 500 people.

22:04.201 --> 22:05.600
Why were you robbing the bank?

22:06.237 --> 22:07.465
Revenge.

22:07.638 --> 22:09.367
Not to help the people?

22:09.540 --> 22:11.235
No.

22:16.380 --> 22:17.608
What?

22:19.650 --> 22:21.743
Stop looking at me that way,
both of you.

22:21.919 --> 22:23.716
My life is not here.

22:24.588 --> 22:26.579
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like?

22:26.757 --> 22:30.090
Taking the money.
I'm going back to Europe.

22:30.261 --> 22:31.592
You're joking.

22:31.762 --> 22:33.855
All right, you can take half. I don't care.

22:34.031 --> 22:36.056
You can even keep the dog as a bonus.

22:38.936 --> 22:40.563
If you want to go, go.

22:40.738 --> 22:42.797
But the money stays. All of it.

22:42.973 --> 22:44.770
-No, it doesn't.
-Yes, it does.

22:44.942 --> 22:46.569
No, it doesn't.

23:58.882 --> 24:02.978
We were just debating
the basic economic theories...

24:03.153 --> 24:05.314
...of wealth distribution.

24:05.489 --> 24:07.821
Yes. Yes, we were.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.717
That's good.

24:09.893 --> 24:12.862
But before you reach
any hasty conclusions...

24:13.030 --> 24:14.725
...let me show you something.

25:07.484 --> 25:08.883
What?

25:09.053 --> 25:11.544
Rice and beans
are not good enough for you?

25:11.722 --> 25:15.158
I just can't eat when I see
what has been done to these people.

25:15.559 --> 25:16.890
At least tonight they can eat.

25:19.630 --> 25:22.622
We have to find a way
to get them back on their land.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.597
We must come up with a plan.

25:24.768 --> 25:26.599
Something that will benefit the people...

25:26.770 --> 25:29.034
...and destroy these murderers.

25:31.575 --> 25:33.839
I think we should rob more banks.

25:34.011 --> 25:35.535
Yeah.

25:42.419 --> 25:44.046
Let's go.

25:44.588 --> 25:46.681
-Let's go where?
-Let's go rob more banks.

25:47.624 --> 25:50.991
We can't just go right now
and rob a bank.

25:51.762 --> 25:53.093
Fine. Finish brushing.

25:53.530 --> 25:55.964
That's not it. We're not ready.

25:56.533 --> 25:58.592
-Yes, we are. We just did it.
-We were lucky.

25:58.769 --> 26:01.966
We cannot rely on luck.
We need to think first.

26:02.139 --> 26:06.200
We need to consider the implications,
the consequences.

26:06.710 --> 26:09.270
-Why are you so complicated?
-Why are you so unrealistic?

26:09.613 --> 26:14.949
This is a noble cause
you seek to undertake, señoritas.

26:15.119 --> 26:19.681
But if you keep fighting like cats and dogs,
you won't make it to sunrise.

26:21.291 --> 26:24.624
My daughters, you know...

26:25.028 --> 26:29.021
...when Columbus proposed his journey
to discover the New World...

26:29.199 --> 26:31.497
...everybody said that was...

26:31.668 --> 26:33.192
...unrealistic.

26:33.370 --> 26:34.803
But he succeeded.

26:34.972 --> 26:38.169
Because he had the king and queen
of Spain to help him.

26:38.342 --> 26:40.833
Who do we have to help us?

26:41.111 --> 26:45.445
I think I might know someone
who can help you.

26:50.320 --> 26:51.787
Can I help you?

26:51.955 --> 26:53.422
We're looking for these two.

26:54.358 --> 26:57.384
What's a pair of señoritas like that
gonna be doing way out here?

26:57.561 --> 27:00.553
We found this snagged on a cactus
half mile down the road.

27:00.731 --> 27:04.167
Well, you find any more of that,
you can make yourself a nice little hankie.

27:05.102 --> 27:07.332
Now, do you mind getting your foot
out of my door?

27:07.804 --> 27:10.204
-And if I don't?
-lf you don't, I'll kill you.

27:10.374 --> 27:12.365
Now get your sorry ass off this porch.

27:12.843 --> 27:14.470
You too.

27:18.715 --> 27:20.012
Come on.

27:35.532 --> 27:37.625
Hey, does this belong to you?

27:37.801 --> 27:39.029
Thank you.

27:39.203 --> 27:40.636
Excuse me.

27:40.904 --> 27:42.098
Mr.--

27:44.675 --> 27:46.768
-Where are you going?
-Far from here.

27:46.944 --> 27:49.970
Toughs like that tend to come back
with reinforcements.

27:50.147 --> 27:52.980
-But you said you would help us.
-I just did, missy.

27:53.150 --> 27:55.948
No, no. Padre Pablo said
you could teach us to rob banks.

27:56.119 --> 27:57.586
Well, where did he get that idea?

27:57.754 --> 27:59.312
He said that's what you used to do.

27:59.489 --> 28:02.390
That you robbed 37 banks in Texas
and never got caught.

28:02.559 --> 28:05.460
Thirty-seven.
Last time I go to confession.

28:05.629 --> 28:09.895
Listen, high-minded ideals is one thing,
robbing banks is another.

28:10.067 --> 28:13.002
And to tell you the truth,
neither one of you pass the muster.

28:13.170 --> 28:16.970
-We're well aware of that. At least I am.
-That's why we came to you.

28:17.140 --> 28:18.471
To learn.

28:18.642 --> 28:20.473
Well, to learn, you gotta have resources.

28:20.644 --> 28:22.441
So far the only thing you've shown me...

28:22.613 --> 28:25.309
...is a talent for bringing trouble
to my front door.

28:25.482 --> 28:26.744
<i>Buena suerte,</i> ladies.

28:29.786 --> 28:31.845
Mr. Buck.

28:34.091 --> 28:35.319
You're not going anywhere...

28:35.492 --> 28:37.983
...until you tell us
everything we need to know.

28:38.295 --> 28:40.286
First, if you pull the trigger
on that gun...

28:40.464 --> 28:42.864
...the way you're pointed,
you might cause it to rain.

28:43.033 --> 28:45.695
-Well, haven't you fired a pistol before?
-I have.

28:45.869 --> 28:47.268
But you didn't kill anybody.

28:47.437 --> 28:48.699
There's always a first time.

28:48.872 --> 28:50.601
That's true. But this ain't it.

28:55.212 --> 28:56.873
Hey.

28:59.716 --> 29:01.445
What are you doing?

29:04.554 --> 29:06.283
Come on. Go on.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.716
What the heck? Go on.

29:18.902 --> 29:20.426
Git.

29:22.205 --> 29:23.604
Go, git.

29:24.474 --> 29:25.532
Come on.

29:34.351 --> 29:36.046
Hey, what have you done to this horse?

29:36.219 --> 29:39.552
-Please, Mr. Buck, they killed my father.
-And they almost killed mine.

29:45.495 --> 29:47.224
You're breaking my heart.

29:47.397 --> 29:51.629
All right, look, no whining, no complaining,
no fighting, or I'm <i>adiós</i>.

29:51.835 --> 29:53.063
I never whine.

29:53.236 --> 29:56.535
-Oh, please.
-"Oh, please." Well, I don't.

29:56.707 --> 29:59.198
-Don't. Don't hit.
-Don't hit me. Stop.

29:59.376 --> 30:00.775
-Don't hit me.
-Don't hit me.

30:00.944 --> 30:02.605
Ladies. Hey.

30:02.779 --> 30:04.713
What's it gonna be?

30:08.719 --> 30:10.050
-Deal.
-Deal.

30:13.957 --> 30:15.185
All right, you first.

30:22.999 --> 30:24.694
That's pretty good.

30:25.635 --> 30:27.967
-How many you got left?
-I don't know.

30:31.441 --> 30:32.806
You need to know.

30:32.976 --> 30:36.605
Many a man's been left to die
for want of an extra bullet.

30:36.780 --> 30:38.771
She's not very good with numbers.

30:38.949 --> 30:40.610
Your turn.

30:50.594 --> 30:52.562
I can't do this.

30:52.729 --> 30:54.594
When I get nervous, I get the hiccups.

30:55.098 --> 30:56.565
Guns make you nervous?

30:56.733 --> 30:58.724
What the hell are you gonna use
to rob banks?

30:58.902 --> 31:00.699
My education.

31:01.505 --> 31:03.097
-"My education."
-What's so funny?

31:03.273 --> 31:05.468
-To rob banks. Rob a bank.
-"My education."

31:07.244 --> 31:10.008
You wish you had one,
you ignorant crack-shot showoff.

31:10.180 --> 31:14.674
Fort Granger, Oklahoma, U.S. Cavalry.
That's my education.

31:16.853 --> 31:19.617
Hey. Hey. Hey.

31:20.424 --> 31:22.654
No one moves.

31:23.493 --> 31:25.654
Get on the floor.

31:25.862 --> 31:29.559
How are they gonna get on the floor?
I told them not to move.

31:29.733 --> 31:31.200
Right.

31:31.368 --> 31:33.962
So get on the floor and no one move.

31:36.706 --> 31:39.402
Sara. Sara.

31:39.576 --> 31:41.476
-I have to tell you something.
-Hold on.

31:41.645 --> 31:44.546
Why are we doing this?
This has nothing to do with robbing banks.

31:44.714 --> 31:46.648
Robbing banks is easy.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.648
It's getting away
that's the hard part.

31:48.819 --> 31:51.219
-Sara.
-How long do we have to stay like this?

31:52.389 --> 31:54.220
-As long as it takes.
-Sara.

31:54.391 --> 31:55.722
What?

31:55.892 --> 31:57.951
I don't think I can hold any longer.

31:58.128 --> 32:00.619
So drop off and swim to the shore.

32:00.797 --> 32:02.628
I can't swim.

32:13.143 --> 32:14.872
Sara.

32:18.048 --> 32:19.276
Sara.

32:34.297 --> 32:35.594
Hold on to the rock.

33:05.362 --> 33:06.693
Thank you.

33:06.863 --> 33:08.490
-For what?
-For saving my life.

33:09.466 --> 33:11.627
You noticed this time.

33:12.235 --> 33:13.725
Good.

33:17.340 --> 33:19.069
-Sara.
-What?

33:19.476 --> 33:22.741
I guess--
I guess this makes us friends now.

33:23.947 --> 33:26.415
I don't know about friends.

33:27.117 --> 33:29.085
But partners....

33:32.689 --> 33:35.089
Definitely partners.

33:44.701 --> 33:46.566
Single file.

33:47.571 --> 33:49.630
You gotta aim. Aim the gun.

33:49.806 --> 33:51.239
Aim it.

33:51.508 --> 33:53.135
Go on, higher. Higher. Higher.

33:54.911 --> 33:56.242
Stinky, I'm sorry.

33:58.348 --> 34:00.908
Come on, go. Faster, faster.

34:19.002 --> 34:22.266
Before you kill your dog,
we need to try something.

34:22.438 --> 34:25.237
Just take that.
See what you can do with those.

34:36.018 --> 34:37.646
See, I knew she had talent.

34:39.789 --> 34:44.158
Two hundred and forty-four, 245, 246...

34:44.327 --> 34:47.989
...247, 248, 24--

35:47.757 --> 35:49.782
That's the expert?

35:55.765 --> 35:57.426
Mr. Cooke...

35:57.834 --> 36:00.064
...welcome to Mexico.

36:00.737 --> 36:03.035
Well, clearly, they're a pair of amateurs.

36:03.206 --> 36:05.674
Robbing a bank in less than a minute
with no casualties.

36:05.842 --> 36:08.743
I'd say they could pass as professionals.

36:11.514 --> 36:14.972
That's odd.
These land transfers they left behind.

36:15.151 --> 36:17.244
Who would sell a farm for one peso?

36:17.420 --> 36:18.648
Mr. Cooke...

36:18.822 --> 36:21.791
...the claim is that you're an expert
in criminal science, correct?

36:21.958 --> 36:25.655
-Yes.
-Down here, I'm the expert in land finance.

36:25.829 --> 36:30.732
So why don't we both just focus on
our respective areas of expertise, okay?

36:30.900 --> 36:33.300
Time's slipping away here.

36:35.405 --> 36:38.135
All right, what's the first rule
of robbing a bank?

36:38.308 --> 36:40.503
-No one gets killed.
-The second?

36:40.677 --> 36:42.736
Don't take more than you can carry
in one hand.

36:42.912 --> 36:45.176
-And the third?
-Getting away is the first rule.

36:45.582 --> 36:46.742
Perfect.

36:47.617 --> 36:49.175
So do you think we're ready?

36:49.652 --> 36:52.246
Well, you really only needed
to know one thing all along...

36:52.422 --> 36:54.287
...and you learned that back in the river.

36:54.457 --> 36:56.152
Trust your partner with your life.

36:58.495 --> 37:01.521
Why did you make us go through
everything else if we were ready?

37:02.532 --> 37:03.760
Well...

37:03.933 --> 37:06.094
...I kind of liked having you two around.

37:10.006 --> 37:11.337
Now go rob me some banks.

37:44.440 --> 37:45.668
Everybody, hands up.

38:18.141 --> 38:20.701
Are you sure the room
has been left undisturbed...

38:20.877 --> 38:22.401
-...since the death?
-Yes.

38:23.479 --> 38:26.414
-You've worked here for a long time?
-Almost 20 years.

38:29.385 --> 38:32.582
Do you know if he took any medication
for his heart condition?

38:32.755 --> 38:35.918
Don Diego was healthy as a horse.

38:36.092 --> 38:38.253
He was never sick a day in his life.

38:39.863 --> 38:41.387
Thank you.

38:41.564 --> 38:43.896
If you'll excuse me.

39:11.427 --> 39:14.487
This should cover the mortgage
on the five farms north of the river.

39:14.664 --> 39:17.690
I was thinking, you know,
we already have a lot of money.

39:17.867 --> 39:20.665
Maybe we should stop
before the regulators--

39:20.837 --> 39:23.237
Padre, they took 1 0 banks,
we take 1 0 banks.

39:23.406 --> 39:27.308
-Right. We still have five to go.
-Four.

39:27.477 --> 39:28.774
That's what I said. Four.

39:28.945 --> 39:32.676
But one of my parishioners
told me about a specialist...

39:32.849 --> 39:36.080
-...they brought in.
-A specialist?

39:36.653 --> 39:39.417
-For us?
-I'm afraid yes.

39:39.589 --> 39:41.580
A detective from New York.

39:42.492 --> 39:44.153
Let him come.

39:54.771 --> 39:56.762
Are you Padre Pablo?

39:56.940 --> 39:58.737
Yes.

39:59.409 --> 40:01.604
-May I come in?
-No.

40:02.946 --> 40:06.541
I thought the house of God was open
to all people at all times.

40:06.916 --> 40:10.909
It is. But God is not at home right now.

40:11.087 --> 40:14.682
He is down the road at the orphanage...

40:14.857 --> 40:17.519
...where I was just going.

40:18.528 --> 40:20.689
I'm Quentin Cooke.

40:21.965 --> 40:24.160
I know who you are, Mr. Cooke.

40:24.334 --> 40:25.528
Oh, you do?

40:25.702 --> 40:28.865
It's my job to know
what concerns my flock.

40:29.706 --> 40:32.368
Okay. Well, then maybe you can help me.

40:33.076 --> 40:34.373
This girl.

40:34.544 --> 40:37.035
-I was wondering if you could tell me--
-No.

40:38.414 --> 40:39.711
I didn't finish the question.

40:40.083 --> 40:42.483
You want to know if I have seen her.

40:43.052 --> 40:45.418
No, I'm sure you haven't seen her.

40:45.588 --> 40:48.523
I was wondering if you could tell me
if she had any problems...

40:48.691 --> 40:51.216
-...with her father.
-I loved my father.

40:51.394 --> 40:53.055
Why does he ask such a question?

40:53.229 --> 40:55.288
She loved her father.

40:55.465 --> 40:57.990
Why do you ask such a question?

40:58.167 --> 40:59.828
Just the way he died.

41:00.837 --> 41:02.065
Anyway....

41:03.873 --> 41:05.807
I'm staying at the hotel...

41:05.975 --> 41:08.068
...in Santa Rita
if you have any information.

41:15.051 --> 41:17.781
What did he mean
about the way my father died?

41:17.954 --> 41:19.854
You heard what I heard.

41:20.023 --> 41:23.618
If you want to know any more,
you will have to ask him.

41:29.198 --> 41:32.065
Come on. Come.

41:49.018 --> 41:51.043
We can take him right here.

41:52.188 --> 41:53.655
-What?
-Wonderful.

41:53.823 --> 41:56.519
-And how do we get the information?
-We ask him.

41:56.826 --> 41:59.886
Our picture's all over the town.

42:03.366 --> 42:05.698
So what? We wear bandannas.

42:05.868 --> 42:07.495
I have a better plan.

42:08.504 --> 42:12.201
Hello, mister. Do you want company?

42:42.105 --> 42:44.699
-What are you doing?
-Saving time.

42:49.679 --> 42:51.579
Yes?

42:58.821 --> 43:00.982
Wrong room.

43:01.157 --> 43:03.887
No. We're compliments
of the management.

43:05.194 --> 43:08.220
-She's new.
-I don't mean to offend you, ladies...

43:08.431 --> 43:09.989
...but I have a fiancée.

43:10.166 --> 43:12.794
-And we have some questions.
-Hands up.

43:13.970 --> 43:15.597
-Down.
-Up.

43:15.771 --> 43:16.999
-Down.
-Up.

43:17.173 --> 43:20.301
-Down.
-Excuse us for a minute.

43:20.476 --> 43:23.707
-What? You've never seen one before?
-Yes, but in the dark.

43:23.880 --> 43:25.108
Up.

43:25.281 --> 43:27.545
-My wallet's over there.
-This is not a robbery.

43:28.851 --> 43:30.648
Oh, my God.

43:31.187 --> 43:33.815
-You're them.
-Yes, it's us.

43:33.990 --> 43:36.788
Well, you're not getting any answers
out of me.

43:36.959 --> 43:39.553
I will not dishonor my profession.

43:40.429 --> 43:42.090
Hey.

43:47.370 --> 43:50.203
-Hey, what are you doing?
-We'll ask the questions.

43:50.840 --> 43:53.070
Is this the fiancée?

43:53.242 --> 43:54.470
Not bad.

43:54.644 --> 43:57.943
-What are you doing?
-Puts me in the mood.

44:02.718 --> 44:04.345
-Ready?
-Smile.

44:12.028 --> 44:13.723
Beautiful.

44:15.097 --> 44:17.588
Unless you tell us everything
we want to know...

44:17.767 --> 44:21.760
...these pictures will show up in every
newspaper from here to New York.

44:22.405 --> 44:24.566
With a special set going to your fiancée.

44:25.841 --> 44:29.436
Then you won't have to worry
about dishonoring your profession.

44:29.612 --> 44:31.045
Because you won't have one.

44:33.683 --> 44:35.583
Now tell me about my father.

44:37.220 --> 44:38.448
I won't tell you anything.

44:38.621 --> 44:40.486
-This is a waste of time.
-Hey, hey.

44:40.656 --> 44:43.557
Excuse my partner.
She's a bit impetuous.

44:43.726 --> 44:47.526
Mr. Cooke, I am asking you
as a daughter who lost her father.

44:54.270 --> 44:56.966
-Did your father drink wine?
-His passion.

44:57.173 --> 45:00.370
I don't think he died of a heart attack.
I think he was poisoned.

45:01.544 --> 45:03.774
-How do you know that?
-Scientific methodology.

45:03.946 --> 45:06.244
It doesn't give you the right
to rob American banks.

45:06.415 --> 45:07.973
Those are Mexican banks.

45:08.184 --> 45:11.017
Those banks are owned by
Capital Bank and Trust of New York...

45:11.187 --> 45:13.655
...and are under the protection
of American laws.

45:14.090 --> 45:16.786
Interesting how your country
always finds a way to justify...

45:16.959 --> 45:19.427
...interfering in other people's affairs.

45:19.595 --> 45:21.495
You're still breaking the law.

45:21.664 --> 45:23.427
-You're the one breaking the law.
-What?

45:23.599 --> 45:24.998
By helping them rob our people.

45:27.003 --> 45:28.800
Help. Hel--

45:34.343 --> 45:37.039
Enough with the hat. The hat belongs...

45:37.213 --> 45:38.976
...on this man. And that....

45:39.448 --> 45:40.881
That's nothing to be ashamed of.

45:41.651 --> 45:44.518
Who said I was ashamed?
Did I say I was ashamed?

45:44.687 --> 45:47.121
-Have you ever even been with a man?
-Yes.

45:47.290 --> 45:49.520
-Of course.
-You haven't.

45:49.692 --> 45:52.058
-Yes, I have.
-Prove it.

45:53.462 --> 45:56.260
Do you want me to produce
a piece of paper signed by a witness?

45:56.432 --> 45:57.831
-No, kiss him.
-What?

45:58.000 --> 45:59.991
-What?
-Well...

46:00.636 --> 46:02.968
...if you kiss a man right,
he will never forget you.

46:03.139 --> 46:05.334
If you kiss him wrong,
he will never remember you.

46:05.508 --> 46:07.408
If you have made love to a man...

46:07.576 --> 46:10.238
...you know this.
If you haven't, you don't.

46:10.413 --> 46:12.540
So that's the proof. Kiss him.

46:15.217 --> 46:16.343
I ca--

46:20.790 --> 46:22.348
I have a fian--

46:24.894 --> 46:26.020
--cée.

46:28.464 --> 46:31.865
If you kiss a man like that, you'll be
forgotten before you leave the room.

46:32.034 --> 46:34.298
-Is that what you want?
-No.

46:34.470 --> 46:36.097
Watch.

46:39.008 --> 46:40.066
I don't--

46:40.242 --> 46:42.107
I don't think that--

46:51.787 --> 46:54.847
-That's a kiss.
-That's a kiss.

46:55.024 --> 46:57.185
Now you try it.

46:57.927 --> 47:00.020
Come on.

47:00.196 --> 47:03.029
Think of the sweetest summer fruit.

47:07.870 --> 47:09.599
Open.

47:20.816 --> 47:23.546
-How was that?
-Better.

47:23.719 --> 47:27.519
-I thought that was pretty good.
-Yes, technically.

47:27.690 --> 47:29.180
But now...

47:30.826 --> 47:33.886
...you have to capture the nuance.

47:40.936 --> 47:42.665
-Sara.
-What?

47:42.838 --> 47:44.931
It's 1 0 to 3.

47:45.441 --> 47:47.102
-Sara.
-What?

47:47.276 --> 47:49.608
-The bank closes at 3.
-Damn.

47:53.983 --> 47:57.612
-Where are you taking me?
-You said you wanted proof, huh?

48:07.596 --> 48:10.997
-You already took all the money.
-We're not here for the money, Bernardo.

48:12.067 --> 48:13.500
Here's your proof.

48:14.370 --> 48:15.803
Who sells a farm for one peso?

48:17.640 --> 48:19.130
Who'd sell a farm for one peso?

48:19.575 --> 48:20.633
Here...

48:20.810 --> 48:24.746
...check the deeds against the railroad map,
and you'll see who the real criminal is.

49:25.574 --> 49:28.372
Señoritas, I think there is something
you should see.

49:32.114 --> 49:34.446
-Please tell me you have a plan.
-No.

49:46.328 --> 49:49.161
We have two choices. Run or fight.

49:49.331 --> 49:51.561
Right. Die now or die later.

49:51.734 --> 49:53.725
-Well, do you have a better idea?
-I do.

49:58.132 --> 50:01.363
-Put your guns down or we'll kill him.
-That's fine by me.

50:01.536 --> 50:03.697
I said, put them down. Now.

50:03.871 --> 50:06.203
He's the boss' son-in-law.

50:11.279 --> 50:13.110
Never mind.

50:25.359 --> 50:27.156
The expert from New York City...

50:27.395 --> 50:29.226
...he was kidnapped by the <i>bandidas</i>, sir.

50:29.397 --> 50:32.332
-Excuse me? What?
-He was kidnapped by the <i>bandidas</i>.

50:34.168 --> 50:35.658
How exactly did that happen?

50:35.837 --> 50:38.635
He was in the bank,
right in the middle of his investigation...

50:38.806 --> 50:41.104
...when these two she-monsters
overwhelmed him.

50:41.275 --> 50:42.970
They took him by force.

50:43.144 --> 50:45.840
Oh, my God. My poor darling.

50:46.013 --> 50:47.446
Don't tell me they killed him.

50:52.887 --> 50:57.347
Now, I'm out of time here,
and I am completely out of patience.

50:57.892 --> 51:03.091
And I would dearly like to see
those two little split-legged bitches dead!

51:06.801 --> 51:08.029
Follow me.

51:09.303 --> 51:11.066
-Get in there.
-Yes, sir.

51:26.020 --> 51:27.749
What is this?

51:28.689 --> 51:32.785
-It's fingerprint powder.
-What's fingerprint?

51:35.196 --> 51:37.357
You see these swirls on your finger?

51:37.531 --> 51:41.194
If you touch something at a crime scene,
I put some of that powder on it...

51:41.369 --> 51:44.497
...and then I can see your fingerprint.
I know that you've been there.

51:44.672 --> 51:45.900
How do you know it's mine?

51:46.073 --> 51:48.564
Because no two people
have the same fingerprint.

51:50.745 --> 51:53.714
-Have you checked everyone in the world?
-No.

51:54.415 --> 51:56.076
But it's proven by science.

51:57.418 --> 51:59.318
Doesn't sound very scientific to me.

52:00.354 --> 52:03.323
-And what is this?
-Oh, that's a microscope.

52:04.892 --> 52:06.484
It...

52:07.028 --> 52:10.122
...helps you see things
that you can't normally see.

52:11.332 --> 52:12.424
Like a thought?

52:13.034 --> 52:15.662
Yeah, sort of.

52:29.350 --> 52:31.648
I don't see anything.

52:32.053 --> 52:33.714
Think harder.

52:35.723 --> 52:38.590
-Sara, what's wrong?
-What's wrong? Everything is wrong.

52:38.759 --> 52:41.853
Jackson's brought in reinforcements,
real killers.

52:42.029 --> 52:44.190
Every bank is guarded now.

52:45.099 --> 52:48.034
They're hunting us like animals,
and I'm running out of ideas.

52:48.202 --> 52:51.933
I don't wanna disappoint these people,
but I don't think I can do this.

52:52.106 --> 52:55.633
-I think you can.
-Quentin, look at me.

52:55.810 --> 52:59.371
I was raised to be a spoiled lady,
not a renegade.

52:59.547 --> 53:02.607
One minute I think I have
all the answers, and the next...

53:02.783 --> 53:06.913
...I am crying for a manicure.
I am lost out here.

53:07.088 --> 53:09.318
Or maybe I'm just lost.

53:09.824 --> 53:12.725
My mother is gone. My father is gone.

53:14.328 --> 53:16.023
I have no place in the world.

53:16.197 --> 53:19.223
Maybe out here is where you belong.

53:21.235 --> 53:23.703
Besides, you're not alone.

53:23.871 --> 53:25.600
Right.

53:25.773 --> 53:28.173
A gun-happy farm girl, an ugly dog...

53:28.342 --> 53:31.800
...a wet-behind-the-ears cop
and a spoiled brat.

53:31.979 --> 53:34.140
What a team.

53:34.315 --> 53:38.445
This may seem odd,
having dedicated myself to the law...

53:39.487 --> 53:43.583
...but I think what you are doing here
is good. In fact, I think it's damn noble.

53:43.758 --> 53:45.692
And I'd like to help.

53:47.661 --> 53:49.151
How?

53:50.931 --> 53:52.762
They're looking for two women, correct?

53:55.603 --> 53:58.834
I guess this is what it feels like, huh?

53:59.006 --> 54:01.804
-To be married.
-Yes.

54:03.244 --> 54:06.975
-May I ask you a favor?
-Of course, it's our wedding day.

54:07.148 --> 54:10.413
Can we lose the horse?
He's a little obvious.

54:10.584 --> 54:13.644
Don't distract him.
I need him to concentrate.

54:15.389 --> 54:16.754
You know what you have to do.

54:21.562 --> 54:23.553
Okay, here we are.

54:34.041 --> 54:35.338
It'll never work.

54:36.310 --> 54:38.904
Because she's wearing the wrong shoes.

54:39.080 --> 54:42.743
I would have done it myself, but I'd
rather die than be seen in that cheap dress.

54:44.785 --> 54:47.515
Good day. Welcome to our bank.

54:48.456 --> 54:50.117
Welcome.

54:50.991 --> 54:52.253
Step in, please.

54:53.928 --> 54:57.728
I assure you, your family jewelry
will be quite secure.

54:57.898 --> 55:01.732
He takes such good care of me,
my Quentin.

55:08.209 --> 55:10.177
The slut.

55:10.878 --> 55:13.039
She can't even get the kiss right.

55:13.214 --> 55:15.205
Come on, we've got work to do.

55:19.453 --> 55:21.182
She's very excited.

55:30.431 --> 55:35.835
The walls are 2 feet of poured cement
reinforced with iron bars...

55:36.003 --> 55:41.942
...and the safe is bolted into the ground,
which is 3 feet of solid rock.

55:57.558 --> 55:59.685
-Did you hear that?
-What?

55:59.860 --> 56:02.590
It sounded like a horse on the roof.

56:04.598 --> 56:07.260
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to
ask you a personal question.

56:07.434 --> 56:09.868
-You don't drink before dinner, do you?
-Of course not.

56:10.037 --> 56:13.598
I was just wondering.
Hearing horses on the roof....

56:16.043 --> 56:18.170
-Can we see inside the safe?
-Sorry.

56:18.345 --> 56:20.939
Unless you are actually ready
to make your deposit.

56:22.550 --> 56:25.781
How about for withdrawals?

56:30.624 --> 56:33.593
Great. Just great.

56:33.761 --> 56:36.093
I didn't know he was going to faint.

56:36.263 --> 56:38.254
These are like megaphones.

56:38.432 --> 56:40.024
Quiet.

56:41.602 --> 56:45.402
-Are you sure you can open it with that?
-No, not officially.

56:46.440 --> 56:47.930
Hey.

57:09.597 --> 57:10.962
Can't you go any faster?

57:11.131 --> 57:15.227
I am going as fast as somebody who's
half-deaf can go, thank you very much.

57:22.576 --> 57:25.739
-Come out with your hands up.
-How much longer?

57:34.722 --> 57:36.485
I did it.

57:36.657 --> 57:39.217
I did it. I did it.

57:46.500 --> 57:47.831
Open this damn door.

57:53.340 --> 57:54.466
Fire.

58:05.886 --> 58:07.353
You've only got one more chance.

58:08.289 --> 58:09.950
I know.

58:27.074 --> 58:29.167
They blew the safe.

58:38.686 --> 58:39.914
There it is.

58:41.755 --> 58:43.518
Okay, you got it?

58:43.691 --> 58:45.921
-Okay, let's go.
-Can I ask you something?

58:46.093 --> 58:48.027
-What?
-How was my kiss?

58:49.096 --> 58:50.688
Perfect.

59:16.423 --> 59:18.550
How the hell?

59:23.831 --> 59:25.355
Come on.

59:45.085 --> 59:48.851
-Anything wrong, Mr. Jackson?
-Nothing to be concerned about...

59:49.590 --> 59:50.579
...governor.

59:50.758 --> 59:53.386
To be honest, Mr. Jackson,
some of my ministers...

59:53.560 --> 59:57.656
...are concerned about the safety
of our state's gold deposit in your bank.

59:57.831 --> 01:00:00.664
They are suggesting perhaps
we move the gold...

01:00:00.834 --> 01:00:02.768
...to a bank not owned by your company.

01:00:02.936 --> 01:00:07.339
Governor, that gold is as safe as
if it was deposited in my own pocket.

01:00:07.508 --> 01:00:11.103
Judging by the success you have
at stopping these <i>bandidas</i>...

01:00:11.278 --> 01:00:14.372
...you may want to check your pockets.

01:00:15.983 --> 01:00:17.450
May I show you something?

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:22.949
Now, governor, this is a prototype...

01:00:23.123 --> 01:00:25.648
...of a revolutionary new system
in security devices.

01:00:25.826 --> 01:00:28.693
We're installing this as fast as we can
in all of our banks...

01:00:28.862 --> 01:00:31.126
...including the one that holds
your gold deposits.

01:00:31.298 --> 01:00:34.096
You. Step on the floor.

01:00:36.703 --> 01:00:39.638
Step-o on-o floor-o.

01:00:47.681 --> 01:00:49.171
Cut it off.

01:00:51.318 --> 01:00:56.221
That floor is fitted with a system that
reacts to the slightest change in weight.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:01:01.726
Before anyone can reach that safe,
they'll be dead! Dead.

01:01:02.663 --> 01:01:05.359
I'm reassured that our gold
is in very good hands.

01:01:05.532 --> 01:01:07.796
-Thank you, governor.
-But I am also concerned...

01:01:07.968 --> 01:01:11.267
...about our people
who deposit their money in your bank.

01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:12.905
Without the new system.

01:01:13.073 --> 01:01:15.974
You know, these <i>bandidas</i> can strike
anywhere, at any time.

01:01:16.143 --> 01:01:19.044
Governor, may I tell you something
in confidence?

01:01:19.213 --> 01:01:25.777
Until those new systems are installed,
all the cash will be stored upstairs.

01:01:25.953 --> 01:01:28.478
They'll never get anywhere near it.

01:01:34.895 --> 01:01:36.419
I'm so sorry for your loss.

01:01:36.797 --> 01:01:39.595
-Her mother was her life.
-I completely understand.

01:01:39.833 --> 01:01:42.324
My daughter is the same way
with her mother.

01:01:42.503 --> 01:01:46.337
She would just die
if the jewelry that her mother left her...

01:01:46.507 --> 01:01:49.908
...wasn't in the safest place,
which is why I brought her here.

01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:54.877
Sweetheart, you understand me...

01:01:55.048 --> 01:01:57.380
...so well.

01:02:08.362 --> 01:02:09.852
She's very upset.

01:02:11.064 --> 01:02:13.123
If I may share a confidence with you.

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.737
Today we put in the most advanced
security system known to man.

01:02:17.905 --> 01:02:20.237
-Can we see it?
-Sorry.

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:21.874
No one can see it.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.754
-We can't do it.
-Yes, we can.

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:46.696
Sara, the only space on the floor
that's not covered by an alarm...

01:02:46.867 --> 01:02:48.334
...is 1 inch between the seam.

01:02:48.502 --> 01:02:52.268
-What would you use to get across?
-Her education.

01:02:52.439 --> 01:02:54.430
At least I have one to use.

01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:56.974
And what are you gonna use
to open the vault?

01:02:57.144 --> 01:02:58.509
The key.

01:03:19.032 --> 01:03:21.023
-Nice shot.
-Thank you.

01:03:21.201 --> 01:03:22.634
-What's this?
-Be careful.

01:03:22.803 --> 01:03:26.239
Those are darts dipped into a compound
made from tree bark in South America.

01:03:26.406 --> 01:03:30.502
The Indians use it to hunt. It doesn't kill
the animal, but it'll put it to sleep.

01:03:30.677 --> 01:03:32.838
So if you have a problem, you use this.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.177
Okay, go.

01:03:39.353 --> 01:03:40.786
I got it.

01:03:40.954 --> 01:03:42.854
Okay. Okay.

01:03:53.567 --> 01:03:55.194
Go.

01:03:59.206 --> 01:04:00.730
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:04:48.655 --> 01:04:50.555
Calm down.

01:05:20.687 --> 01:05:22.484
Sorry.

01:05:45.612 --> 01:05:47.102
Great.

01:05:51.017 --> 01:05:53.315
-When's the last time you were on these?
-I was 1 0.

01:05:53.487 --> 01:05:55.352
-Oh, great.
-Don't worry. I can do this.

01:05:55.522 --> 01:05:59.014
Okay. There's no need to rush.
Just don't take any chances.

01:05:59.192 --> 01:06:00.989
Just stay calm.

01:06:01.528 --> 01:06:03.519
-Don't be nervous.
-You're making me nervous.

01:06:03.697 --> 01:06:05.460
Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, okay.

01:06:10.971 --> 01:06:12.199
What's wrong?

01:06:12.372 --> 01:06:15.205
-I need to be calm.
-Yes, you're right. Calm down.

01:06:22.916 --> 01:06:25.714
-Okay, I'm calm now.
-Me too.

01:06:32.092 --> 01:06:34.287
How was my kiss?

01:06:34.795 --> 01:06:37.355
-It was perfect.
-I knew it.

01:06:49.709 --> 01:06:51.176
Sara.

01:06:51.778 --> 01:06:54.372
-Do you really have to sing?
-Yes.

01:06:54.981 --> 01:06:57.347
-It puts me in the mood.
-Okay.

01:07:20.373 --> 01:07:22.807
Bravo. Bravo.

01:07:27.981 --> 01:07:29.448
Santa Maria.

01:07:29.616 --> 01:07:30.878
Oh, my G--

01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.517
I'm gonna go check the vault.

01:07:34.688 --> 01:07:36.747
-Right.
-I'll stick that banjo up--

01:07:37.624 --> 01:07:38.921
I ain't got none of that.

01:07:44.598 --> 01:07:47.499
Hey, what's the matter with you?

01:07:47.667 --> 01:07:49.567
You all right?

01:08:09.689 --> 01:08:12.214
Tequila must be pretty good down here.

01:08:15.428 --> 01:08:16.417
Sara.

01:08:17.497 --> 01:08:19.089
Come on, hurry up.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:20.926
I'm doing my best.

01:08:27.006 --> 01:08:28.599
-Everything calm?
-Yeah.

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:42.746
-What are you doing?
-My father raised me to finish what I start.

01:08:42.923 --> 01:08:46.518
If I'm going to rob a bank,
I'm going to do it properly.

01:08:47.761 --> 01:08:49.626
Damn idiot,
what are you doing with my gun?

01:08:49.796 --> 01:08:51.388
Don't you call me a damn idiot.

01:08:56.502 --> 01:08:58.437
Okay, slow, slow, slow.

01:08:58.904 --> 01:09:01.499
-Who are you calling a damn idiot?
-I told you....

01:09:06.779 --> 01:09:09.544
Come on. Okay. Come on.

01:09:10.649 --> 01:09:12.481
-Shut up.
-Stop.

01:09:24.596 --> 01:09:25.586
Oh, God.

01:09:28.667 --> 01:09:30.465
Quentin.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.535
Hold it.

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:37.006
Wake up.

01:09:37.711 --> 01:09:39.234
Hold it.

01:09:42.314 --> 01:09:43.304
Hold it.

01:09:44.751 --> 01:09:47.618
Quentin. Sara.

01:09:48.822 --> 01:09:50.517
Come on, let's go.

01:09:59.099 --> 01:10:01.761
No, no. Other way. Other way.

01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:12.672
Party's over.

01:10:15.715 --> 01:10:18.206
Looks like we're about to start the party.

01:10:18.385 --> 01:10:20.876
You might wanna get ready
to do last rites, Padre...

01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:23.488
...or whatever it is you all do.

01:10:28.028 --> 01:10:32.362
I can't believe you can't even do
a simple thing like stare at the street.

01:10:32.532 --> 01:10:35.865
-You were supposed to be looking out.
-I was.

01:10:36.036 --> 01:10:37.867
If you were, we wouldn't be sitting here.

01:10:38.038 --> 01:10:40.268
If you weren't greedy,
you would've been faster.

01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:42.874
You are inefficient and unprofessional.

01:10:43.043 --> 01:10:44.806
Think I didn't see you sneaking kisses?

01:10:44.978 --> 01:10:46.639
I was a bride. That's what we do.

01:10:46.813 --> 01:10:48.280
And don't play innocent with me.

01:10:48.448 --> 01:10:50.814
I saw you sticking your tongue
down his throat.

01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:54.579
What kind of a bride smells like a horse
and kisses like a chicken pecking corn?

01:10:54.754 --> 01:10:56.949
I was a sad widow in need of comfort.

01:10:57.123 --> 01:10:59.751
Well, for your information,
he said my kiss was perfect.

01:10:59.926 --> 01:11:01.325
For your information, he said--

01:11:01.494 --> 01:11:04.554
For your information,
I'm sick of you both fighting over kisses...

01:11:04.731 --> 01:11:07.825
...when the future
of your country is at stake.

01:11:08.134 --> 01:11:10.602
How did I ever fall for this?
You're not serious.

01:11:10.770 --> 01:11:13.671
You're silly girls playing
with the lives of thousands of people.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:15.273
A spoiled brat and a farm hand.

01:11:15.442 --> 01:11:19.105
You think people are gonna follow you?
You think you're changing history?

01:11:19.279 --> 01:11:20.712
What was I thinking?

01:11:20.880 --> 01:11:25.317
Throwing away my life and my career.
And for what?

01:11:25.718 --> 01:11:27.151
You know the saddest part?

01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.311
No one will care,
nothing will have changed...

01:11:29.556 --> 01:11:31.183
...because we're gonna be hanged!

01:11:58.651 --> 01:12:00.744
I might not know who I am...

01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:03.047
...but I know who I'm not.

01:12:03.223 --> 01:12:06.158
And I'm not someone
who's gonna let her country down.

01:12:16.269 --> 01:12:18.669
Governor, I have good news,
and I have bad news.

01:12:18.838 --> 01:12:22.296
Now, the good news is that my people
were able to save a portion of the money.

01:12:22.876 --> 01:12:26.175
We even had both <i>bandidas</i> in custody.

01:12:26.346 --> 01:12:30.476
The bad news is your people freed them.

01:12:32.919 --> 01:12:35.888
Mr. Jackson, I must apologize to you.

01:12:36.055 --> 01:12:39.320
I never expected the situation
to become so unstable.

01:12:39.492 --> 01:12:41.517
Your help has been invaluable.

01:12:41.694 --> 01:12:45.255
But now I don't know what to do.
I'm hoping you have a solution.

01:12:45.431 --> 01:12:49.868
You can rest assured, the Capital Bank
and Trust of New York has a solution.

01:12:50.036 --> 01:12:52.163
He said they're moving
the gold reserve to Texas.

01:12:52.772 --> 01:12:54.637
What does it mean?

01:12:54.807 --> 01:12:57.367
It means it's over. He figured it out.

01:12:57.844 --> 01:13:00.438
-Figured what out?
-How to beat us.

01:13:00.613 --> 01:13:02.342
He's not beating us, we're beating him.

01:13:02.749 --> 01:13:05.240
Now we are strong enough
to take all the other banks.

01:13:05.685 --> 01:13:08.017
So let him have the gold.

01:13:08.188 --> 01:13:10.281
We'll have all the money.

01:13:10.456 --> 01:13:12.890
Maria, the money is just paper.

01:13:13.059 --> 01:13:15.357
It represents the value of the gold.

01:13:15.528 --> 01:13:17.860
It's what the entire monetary system
is based on.

01:13:18.031 --> 01:13:21.694
Without the gold, the paper has no value.

01:13:22.235 --> 01:13:23.634
Then we should rob the gold.

01:13:28.141 --> 01:13:29.631
Did I say something wrong?

01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:37.550
-Shut that and lock it.
-Yeah, right away.

01:13:46.059 --> 01:13:47.287
You know...

01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:50.190
...this might be the last time
we get to talk.

01:13:50.363 --> 01:13:52.797
Don't say that. It's bad luck.

01:13:52.966 --> 01:13:56.060
I'm a superstitious peasant, remember?

01:13:56.402 --> 01:14:00.133
No, you're a lot more than that.

01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:05.070
You always know what you want,
and you always know what you feel.

01:14:07.580 --> 01:14:09.070
I admire you, Maria.

01:14:13.052 --> 01:14:15.953
You admire me?
How can you admire me?

01:14:16.122 --> 01:14:19.216
All I know about is horses and chickens.

01:14:19.592 --> 01:14:20.820
Well...

01:14:20.994 --> 01:14:23.588
...now I also know
how to really give a good kiss.

01:14:31.437 --> 01:14:34.099
It's been good to have you as a partner.

01:14:40.046 --> 01:14:41.809
It's been good to have you as a friend.

01:14:43.650 --> 01:14:47.086
You've taught me a lot
about how to care about people.

01:14:56.296 --> 01:14:58.230
And you were a--

01:14:58.765 --> 01:15:00.232
You were a beautiful widow.

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.925
Well, black, it's always a flattering color.

01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:05.662
There's one more thing
I'd like to get off my chest.

01:15:07.874 --> 01:15:09.603
This bloody corset.

01:15:09.776 --> 01:15:12.609
It's been squeezing my gut
my whole life.

01:15:28.795 --> 01:15:31.059
Thank you so much for making the effort.

01:15:31.230 --> 01:15:34.529
Mr. Governor, it's not an effort,
it's an honor.

01:15:34.701 --> 01:15:37.499
You wanted me here
to show our support for your plan.

01:15:37.670 --> 01:15:38.898
Here I am.

01:15:39.572 --> 01:15:41.631
Señorita Clarissa...

01:15:41.808 --> 01:15:44.402
...thank you for gracing our journey
with your beauty.

01:15:44.577 --> 01:15:48.411
I wish I could be better company,
but I'm so nervous about my Quentin.

01:15:48.581 --> 01:15:51.414
-Is there any word?
-Mr. Jackson?

01:15:51.584 --> 01:15:55.350
I wouldn't be surprised if, by the end of
this ride, your man was back by your side.

01:15:55.521 --> 01:15:57.614
-Really?
-Really.

01:15:57.890 --> 01:16:00.484
Now if you'll excuse us, miss.
Gentlemen.

01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:03.094
-Did you hear that, Daddy?
-Every word.

01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:06.291
It's a sad state of affairs
when the wealth of my nation...

01:16:06.466 --> 01:16:08.195
...must be protected
by another country.

01:16:08.368 --> 01:16:11.929
Sir, let me assure you, you are acting
in the best interest of your people.

01:16:12.105 --> 01:16:15.836
Governor, if you don't mind, I'd like
for you to review our security measures.

01:16:16.175 --> 01:16:19.269
-Of course. Excuse me.
-Yes, yes, certainly.

01:16:19.445 --> 01:16:23.609
Mr. Jackson, was my trip down here
really necessary?

01:16:23.783 --> 01:16:25.808
Mr. Ashe...

01:16:26.085 --> 01:16:28.918
...to get that gold released
to be put onboard this train...

01:16:29.088 --> 01:16:31.147
...the governor needed
some show of confidence.

01:16:31.324 --> 01:16:33.315
In order to catch those two
thieving women...

01:16:33.493 --> 01:16:35.120
...I need that gold onboard.

01:16:35.294 --> 01:16:37.319
Catch them?
What do you mean, catch them?

01:16:37.497 --> 01:16:41.365
The walls have ears down here in Mexico,
so I whispered into them.

01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:43.331
That gold is my bait.

01:16:43.503 --> 01:16:45.994
And the fish are onboard,
I can guarantee you that.

01:16:46.172 --> 01:16:47.696
-Good God, man.
-All we gotta do...

01:16:47.874 --> 01:16:50.001
...is keep this train rolling up into Texas.

01:16:50.176 --> 01:16:53.236
That's where our law will take effect.
They'll be hanged by sundown.

01:16:53.413 --> 01:16:57.281
Hanging somebody without a fair trial
is not our law, Mr. Jackson.

01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:01.147
Oh, it will be.
As soon as those two pop up.

01:17:12.832 --> 01:17:16.359
There is no security out here,
Mr. Jackson.

01:17:16.536 --> 01:17:19.164
Oh, but quite to the contrary, governor.

01:17:19.338 --> 01:17:20.930
Indeed, there is.

01:17:21.107 --> 01:17:23.541
Security for my old age.

01:17:23.709 --> 01:17:26.701
Your gold.
Or, rather, should I say, my gold.

01:17:26.879 --> 01:17:29.541
-I'm not following.
-No, sir, you're not.

01:17:33.252 --> 01:17:35.618
-What is that?
-What do you think it is?

01:17:35.988 --> 01:17:37.922
You'll probably end up
shooting one of us.

01:17:38.090 --> 01:17:40.820
-Thank you for the vote of confidence.
-Just being realistic.

01:17:40.993 --> 01:17:43.757
You, realistic? Please, that's a first.

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.694
-You shooting a gun, that's a first.
-Excuse me, I'm sorry.

01:17:46.866 --> 01:17:50.199
Can we just stick
to robbing the train? Okay.

01:17:54.207 --> 01:17:58.041
Well, if it don't smell like supper in here,
my damn nose is broke.

01:18:00.213 --> 01:18:02.511
Oh, my, my. Is those black beans?

01:18:42.321 --> 01:18:45.051
-Where's the governor?
-He's out stretching his legs.

01:18:45.224 --> 01:18:46.919
What do you mean, stretching his legs?

01:18:47.093 --> 01:18:49.254
-Well, I guess he fell off the train.
-Daddy?

01:18:49.428 --> 01:18:51.123
-What's going on here?
-Look, Mr. Ashe.

01:18:51.297 --> 01:18:53.765
We had 60 days
to get those railroads locked up.

01:18:53.933 --> 01:18:57.630
When I saw that, because of the problems
those two bitches have been causing...

01:18:57.803 --> 01:19:00.738
...we were gonna lose
that window of opportunity, I decided...

01:19:00.907 --> 01:19:04.536
...why not take advantage of the situation
while it was there?

01:19:04.710 --> 01:19:08.544
-You're stealing the gold.
-Yes, sir, I am.

01:19:08.714 --> 01:19:11.774
-You stop this train right now.
-No, sir, I won't.

01:19:11.951 --> 01:19:15.216
I am not in the thieving business.
I will have no part of this.

01:19:15.388 --> 01:19:18.482
I don't believe that any part of this
was ever offered to you.

01:19:19.258 --> 01:19:20.816
-God.
-No one move.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.622
-Hands up.
-Daddy.

01:19:22.795 --> 01:19:24.319
Don't move.

01:19:25.364 --> 01:19:27.264
Turn around.

01:19:27.433 --> 01:19:29.458
-Are you okay?
-Now, see here.

01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:31.694
I said, turn around.

01:19:31.871 --> 01:19:34.704
You, drop the gun.

01:19:35.174 --> 01:19:37.665
Boy, you two are sure playing
a losing hand here.

01:19:37.843 --> 01:19:40.004
I got men all over this goddamn train.

01:19:40.179 --> 01:19:41.806
Guess again.

01:19:43.282 --> 01:19:46.183
-You won't get away with this.
-You're the one not getting away.

01:19:46.619 --> 01:19:49.144
Killing and robbing our people
in the name of your bank.

01:19:49.322 --> 01:19:52.257
-What is she talking about?
-He murdered my father.

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:54.515
You ain't got no proof of that.

01:19:54.694 --> 01:19:56.628
We have fingerprints,
we have litmus paper.

01:19:56.796 --> 01:19:58.423
We have a microscope.

01:19:58.598 --> 01:20:00.293
What are you two going on about?

01:20:00.466 --> 01:20:01.933
The scientific method.

01:20:02.301 --> 01:20:03.859
Quentin?

01:20:05.605 --> 01:20:09.405
-Quentin.
-What are you doing here?

01:20:09.575 --> 01:20:11.600
What the hell are you doing here?

01:21:02.862 --> 01:21:04.193
Get out of my way.

01:21:06.232 --> 01:21:08.860
-Quentin.
-What are you doing? Come on, come on.

01:21:09.035 --> 01:21:10.662
He shot you.

01:21:25.985 --> 01:21:28.317
<i>No hablo</i> Spanish.

01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:42.399
Goddamn it.

01:22:14.133 --> 01:22:17.432
Hey, where are you going?
You're gonna let him get away.

01:22:29.682 --> 01:22:32.116
-You think he's dead?
-lf he's not, he will be.

01:22:32.852 --> 01:22:36.413
-Maybe we should hold him for the law.
-What? He killed your father.

01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:37.817
I know.

01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:41.118
I wanna kill him, I dream of killing him.

01:22:41.761 --> 01:22:45.697
But if I do,
that makes me no better than him.

01:22:46.265 --> 01:22:47.926
Maria...

01:22:50.469 --> 01:22:52.164
...I don't think I can kill a man.

01:22:55.241 --> 01:22:56.902
Me neither.

01:23:00.446 --> 01:23:03.313
-But I'm going to anyway.
-Maybe just wound him.

01:23:05.718 --> 01:23:07.709
Think this is gonna give me
a bad reputation?

01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.054
-Shooting people?
-No...

01:23:10.222 --> 01:23:13.191
...I think it would just add
to your legend.

01:23:13.893 --> 01:23:16.088
I have a legend?

01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:17.721
Of course we do.

01:23:27.907 --> 01:23:29.465
Always count your bullets.

01:23:57.636 --> 01:24:00.833
He was enlisted to help us uncover
the real <i>bandido</i>.

01:24:01.006 --> 01:24:04.533
-He helped fix our country.
-So we honor him...

01:24:04.710 --> 01:24:07.543
...for bravery above and beyond
the call of duty...

01:24:07.713 --> 01:24:10.648
...and for the service he has done
for the people of Mexico.

01:24:10.816 --> 01:24:14.047
And for helping to bring
our people together.

01:24:14.220 --> 01:24:15.881
I'm gonna miss you.

01:24:21.727 --> 01:24:23.661
I'm going to miss you.

01:24:34.173 --> 01:24:38.803
Quentin, I, too, wish to express
my appreciation. Now, if you please...

01:24:38.978 --> 01:24:40.673
...get on the train.

01:24:43.749 --> 01:24:45.011
I...

01:24:45.918 --> 01:24:47.476
...better go.

01:24:59.331 --> 01:25:02.459
Oh, Quentin.
I can't believe you made it all work out.

01:25:02.635 --> 01:25:05.103
I'm so happy.

01:25:24.156 --> 01:25:26.784
She's not a very good kisser.

01:25:26.959 --> 01:25:28.449
Well, she is.

01:25:28.627 --> 01:25:31.528
But you're much better. Much better.

01:25:38.103 --> 01:25:40.435
I can't believe the way
he was teasing her.

01:25:40.606 --> 01:25:43.871
So insincere, such a liar.

01:25:44.043 --> 01:25:47.069
Telling me my kiss was perfect,
then telling you.

01:25:47.246 --> 01:25:49.612
I'm sure he's telling her the same thing.

01:25:50.015 --> 01:25:51.983
What do you think?

01:25:53.018 --> 01:25:54.679
-Sara.
-What?

01:25:54.853 --> 01:25:57.822
Don't you think it's obvious
that he doesn't love her?

01:25:57.990 --> 01:26:00.288
Is that why you woke me up?

01:26:00.726 --> 01:26:02.660
I was finally having such a nice sleep.

01:26:02.828 --> 01:26:06.958
At least you can sleep. I never
had trouble sleeping before I met you.

01:26:07.132 --> 01:26:08.656
Now I can't stop thinking.

01:26:08.834 --> 01:26:12.201
You should be very grateful
that now your brain is thinking.

01:26:12.838 --> 01:26:15.568
Would you please be quiet
so I can at least enjoy the sunset?

01:26:16.675 --> 01:26:18.302
You've never seen a sunset before?

01:26:18.844 --> 01:26:20.641
It's just that this sunset reminds me...

01:26:20.813 --> 01:26:23.748
...of a particularly beautiful one
I saw in Cádiz.

01:26:25.184 --> 01:26:27.379
-Where is that?
-Cádiz?

01:26:28.253 --> 01:26:30.244
In Europe.

01:26:30.422 --> 01:26:34.290
-Can I ask you one more thing?
-One more.

01:26:35.894 --> 01:26:38.385
How are the banks in Europe?

01:26:43.869 --> 01:26:45.336
Bigger.
