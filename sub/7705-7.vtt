Don't forget, we're gonna
talk about my birthday.

00:08.042 --> 00:10.509
No problem.

00:10.511 --> 00:14.380
So, Brian,
your birthday is Thursday

00:14.382 --> 00:16.782
how old are you gonna be?

00:16.784 --> 00:18.150
Seven.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.385
How old are you, ALF?

00:19.387 --> 00:22.554
Two hundred
twenty nine in August.

00:22.556 --> 00:25.224
Gosh! How do you
blow out 229 candles?

00:25.226 --> 00:29.328
Ah, blowin' 'em out was easy,
lightin' 'em was trouble.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.296
See, by the time
you're half finished

00:31.298 --> 00:33.065
your wrist is on fire!

00:33.067 --> 00:36.068
Ha! Oh, yeah! I kill me.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.904
Have you decided what you want
on your birthday cake, Bri?

00:38.906 --> 00:42.408
- Frosting! Ha!
- Oh!

00:42.410 --> 00:44.376
Brian, your mother wants to know

00:44.378 --> 00:46.412
what kind of decoration
you want on your cake.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.914
Robin Hood,
Hupel and Cassidy?

00:48.916 --> 00:51.917
- Archie and Jughead?
- Who are they?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.853
People mom and dad
went to school with.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.755
Perhaps, those were
outdated examples.

00:56.757 --> 01:00.492
Hey, what about my favorite
character on the cake?

01:00.494 --> 01:03.562
Ruth, the two-headed nurse.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.764
- Ruth?
- The two-headed nurse?

01:05.766 --> 01:09.501
Yeah! She was
the Venowite of Melmac.

01:09.503 --> 01:11.603
And the Bedywite.

01:11.605 --> 01:15.274
A gorgeous natural
and bleached blonde.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.776
Oh, Willie, she was voluptuous.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.911
Sultry.

01:18.913 --> 01:22.114
She had four sexy eyes
and outstanding--

01:22.116 --> 01:25.717
- ALF.
- Nursing skills.

01:25.719 --> 01:29.221
Why don't we let Brian choose
his own cake decoration?

01:29.223 --> 01:30.923
I just can't decide right now.

01:30.925 --> 01:35.627
If he hasn't decided by
noon tomorrow, we go with Ruth.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.762
Fine.

01:36.764 --> 01:41.100
But right now, it's time
to talk about presents

01:41.102 --> 01:42.367
isn't it, ALF?

01:42.369 --> 01:44.203
Oh, yeah, yeah, presents.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.805
Right, right, yeah.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.907
- Give me the lead in.
- Oh, yeah.

01:48.909 --> 01:53.712
What kind of presents
do you give on Melmac, ALF?

01:55.449 --> 01:58.650
Well, Brian, on Melmac

01:58.652 --> 02:03.889
we always give
very<i> expensive</i> presents.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.125
How was that?

02:06.127 --> 02:08.327
[whispering]

02:08.329 --> 02:11.797
Oh, and lots of them, yeah.

02:11.799 --> 02:15.334
Oh, and specially on
your seventh birthday.

02:15.336 --> 02:17.736
Smooth, guys, very smooth.

02:20.941 --> 02:22.975
Oh, by the way

02:22.977 --> 02:26.011
we've decided
on the two-headed nurse.

02:26.013 --> 02:27.946
What a surprise!

02:27.948 --> 02:30.749
Give me five. Yeah!

02:30.751 --> 02:33.685
- Give me four.
- Ah!

03:53.934 --> 03:55.767
Let me know when
you're gonna do that, will you?

03:55.769 --> 03:57.269
Excuse me,
I-I just wanted to get

03:57.271 --> 03:58.704
something out of the dryer.

03:58.706 --> 04:02.074
Well, don't take the sheep.
I'm counting it.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.076
Can't sleep, eh?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.178
Not a wink.

04:06.180 --> 04:08.113
Feel like chatty?

04:08.115 --> 04:10.015
What is it, ALF?

04:10.017 --> 04:12.951
I'm really depressed
about Brian's birthday.

04:12.953 --> 04:16.788
Why? The two-headed nurse
is gonna be on the cake.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.757
It reminds me of
how I'll never have

04:18.759 --> 04:20.726
another birthday
with my friends.

04:20.728 --> 04:22.928
Oh. ALF, you did have

04:22.930 --> 04:25.430
a lot of birthdays
with your friends.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.466
You're 228.

04:27.468 --> 04:29.601
Yeah, but that last one
was a real bummer.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.969
Oh, how come?

04:30.971 --> 04:34.539
Well, for one thing,
the planet exploded.

04:34.541 --> 04:36.642
But it wasn't just that.

04:36.644 --> 04:40.112
I was finally gonna
get together with my true love.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.647
Rhonda.

04:41.649 --> 04:43.115
You know, I really
should turn this off

04:43.117 --> 04:44.883
before that sheep
gets scorched.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.585
You don't want
to hear this, do you?

04:46.587 --> 04:49.154
Sure I do.
Tell me about Rhoda.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.656
Rhoda?

04:50.658 --> 04:53.959
Well, I thought she was funny
when she was on "Mary's Show"

04:53.961 --> 04:56.495
but when she got her own series

04:56.497 --> 04:59.264
they married her off too soon.

04:59.266 --> 05:02.234
Weren't we talking
about your girlfriend?

05:02.236 --> 05:07.306
Oh, Rhonda?
Yeah, what a knockout.

05:07.308 --> 05:10.809
Our very first date
was gonna be on my birthday.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.912
- The night your planet blew up?
- That's right.

05:13.914 --> 05:18.750
I was brushed and curried
and ready for love.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.819
Then word came..

05:20.821 --> 05:25.357
"Orbit Guards
man your battle stations."

05:25.359 --> 05:27.859
The rest is history.

05:27.861 --> 05:32.030
<i> Sayonara,</i> Melmac,
and<i> sayonara,</i> Rhonda.

05:32.032 --> 05:35.434
- I'm sorry, ALF.
- Thanks.

05:35.436 --> 05:38.770
Well, goodnight, Willie.

05:38.772 --> 05:42.174
Reminds me a little of me
and Marsha Shankin.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.142
I said goodnight.

05:44.144 --> 05:47.379
Alright, tell me about
you and the Martian.

05:47.381 --> 05:50.148
Not the Martian. Marsha.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.017
Marsha Shankin.

05:52.019 --> 05:55.220
It was someone I knew
before I met your moth..

05:55.222 --> 05:56.955
Kate.

05:56.957 --> 06:01.226
I had a really serious crush
on Marsha Shankin.

06:01.228 --> 06:04.863
By the time I got
the nerve up to ask her out..

06:05.532 --> 06:06.998
...she moved to Toledo.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.233
Uncanny.

06:08.235 --> 06:13.071
My planet blew up and some girl
you knew moved to Ohio.

- Goodnight, Willie.

Or not.

12:28.448 --> 12:31.616
Maybe if you got off the couch

12:31.618 --> 12:34.586
and walked on you feet,
you might feel better.

12:34.588 --> 12:37.789
Walk?
I could hardly blink.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.160
I'm exhausted.

12:43.029 --> 12:46.397
- What's going in here?
- Ohh!

12:46.399 --> 12:49.200
[groaning]

12:49.202 --> 12:51.402
Should I wait to do this?

12:51.404 --> 12:53.471
Tomorrow would be better.

12:53.473 --> 12:58.143
By then,
I'll be completely bald.

12:58.145 --> 13:01.946
That's usually
the last stage before..

13:01.948 --> 13:03.214
...the end.

13:03.216 --> 13:05.984
- ALF!
- Here.

13:05.986 --> 13:09.354
Keep this somewhere
in a safe place.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.158
"Last will and testament?"

13:13.160 --> 13:15.226
[coughing]

13:15.996 --> 13:18.396
"I, Gordon Shumway.."

13:18.965 --> 13:20.999
Shumway?

13:21.001 --> 13:23.334
Don't blab that around
till I'm gone.

13:24.104 --> 13:25.403
"...do hereby bequeath

13:25.405 --> 13:28.239
all of my worldly
and cosmic goods.."

13:28.241 --> 13:29.507
We made contact!

13:29.509 --> 13:32.010
- We made contact!
- It's a Melmacian.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.012
It's somebody named Skip.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.181
Give me that.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.750
And you never heard
the name Shumway!

13:40.287 --> 13:42.120
(Skip on radio)
'Hey! Where'd you guys go?'

13:42.122 --> 13:43.421
'I don't have all day.'

13:43.423 --> 13:45.924
It's really him! It's Skip!

13:45.926 --> 13:48.259
Skip, Skip, can you hear me?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.528
Yeah, yeah.
Hear you loud and clear.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.363
Who was I talking to before?

13:52.365 --> 13:54.332
Oh, well,
that was one of the kids.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.302
(Skip)
'Kids? You got kids now?'

13:57.304 --> 13:59.003
No. Well, well,
they're not mine.

13:59.005 --> 14:02.507
I mean, I'm just living
with them and their parents.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.944
- Hi, Skip, I'm Brian.
- Hi, kid.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.213
I'm Willy, and this is Kate.

14:08.215 --> 14:10.415
Kate, say hi to Skip!

14:11.017 --> 14:12.984
Hi..

14:12.986 --> 14:14.018
...Skip.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.486
Is everybody okay?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.689
Have you heard from anyone else?

14:17.691 --> 14:20.225
Well, Rick and Stella
got married.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.994
They opened up
a tanning parlor on Mercury.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.729
Where are you?

14:24.731 --> 14:27.732
(Skip)
'I got to Hambetal,
and I'm headed for Andromeda.'

14:27.734 --> 14:30.235
'Give me your coordinates.
I'll do a fly-by.'

14:30.237 --> 14:32.737
'Pick you up tomorrow,
about sevenish.'

14:32.739 --> 14:37.508
Oh, uh, tomorrow?
Uh, that's Brian's birthday.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.878
Yeah, you can come
to my birthday party.

14:39.880 --> 14:44.048
Well, sure. We'd love to
have you! Wouldn't we, dear?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.751
Right!<i> Mi casa su casa.</i>

14:46.753 --> 14:50.188
Uh, Skip, Skip!, can you
maybe make it next week?

14:50.190 --> 14:52.390
I hate to miss
Brian's birthday, and, uh

14:52.392 --> 14:55.660
Friday, the transvestites
are back on "Donahue."

14:56.930 --> 14:59.931
(Skip)
Hey, I'm not runnin'
a bus service.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.599
Do what you have to do.

15:01.601 --> 15:05.937
But I know someone else who's
gonna be really disappointed.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.939
Rhonda.

15:07.941 --> 15:11.442
Rhonda? You've seen Rhonda?

15:11.444 --> 15:14.412
Seen her? She's right here.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.081
Hey, say something, sweetheart.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.616
Hi, cutie.

15:19.552 --> 15:22.287
[stammering]
Rho-Rho-Rhonda!

15:22.289 --> 15:24.689
Yes, Gordon, it's me.

15:25.625 --> 15:26.958
I've missed you.

15:27.761 --> 15:29.627
[gulps]
Yikes.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.630
Uh, what are you
doing with Skip?

15:32.632 --> 15:34.132
Not much.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.035
You're the only one for me.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.038
[whining]

15:40.040 --> 15:42.373
You-you-you mean that, Rhonda?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.475
Cross my heart.

15:44.477 --> 15:47.979
Forget the transvestites.
See you tomorrow!

15:47.981 --> 15:49.547
Yeah!

15:53.320 --> 15:55.553
Okay, there.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.323
There we go!
What do you think, Bri?

15:58.325 --> 16:01.326
It's the worst day of my life.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.995
Bri, we know how much
ALF means to you.

16:03.997 --> 16:07.065
But, honey, he wants to be
with his old friends again.

16:07.067 --> 16:10.001
I-I'm sure that he feels
just as bad about it as you do.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.236
¶ I got the world on a string ¶

16:12.238 --> 16:13.604
¶ Sitting on a rainbow ¶¶

16:13.606 --> 16:16.908
Oh, am I interrupting something?

16:16.910 --> 16:20.345
Not really. We were just hanging
up this "Happy Birthday" sign.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.180
Brian was about to cry.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.082
Hey, come here, tiger.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.418
Willie, hold this.
Come here.

16:28.488 --> 16:31.155
Look, try to understand.

16:31.157 --> 16:33.591
If you were living
on Melmac with me

16:33.593 --> 16:37.195
and-and you had a chance to come
back home to your family

16:37.197 --> 16:39.130
you'd go, wouldn't ya?

16:39.132 --> 16:42.033
I'd never leave<i> you,</i> ALF.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.968
This isn't going well.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.703
No, it's not.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.841
Brian, this is just something
I have to do.

16:49.843 --> 16:53.711
And I know that even though
you don't believe this..

16:53.713 --> 16:56.948
...some day
you're gonna understand.

16:58.985 --> 17:02.053
Hey, Kate, I don't suppose
there's any chance of taking

17:02.055 --> 17:03.654
Lucky with me, is there?

17:03.656 --> 17:06.357
- No.
- Alright, alright.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.126
Willie, you better
let him out of there.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.627
Oh, no!

17:11.064 --> 17:12.463
What?

17:14.334 --> 17:17.201
Sorry, Lucky.
You would've liked Skip.

17:17.203 --> 17:19.904
And I know
Skip would have liked you.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.741
ALF..

17:23.743 --> 17:26.878
...we thought you might
want some cake before you go.

17:26.880 --> 17:28.413
Hey!

17:28.415 --> 17:30.748
That's me on that cake.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.919
- It's an ALF cake.
- That's what Brian wanted.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.521
I'm speechless.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.756
Lynn, this is
really nice of you.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.224
Well, mom made it.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.260
Kate, I didn't know you cared.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.329
Well...it was a mix.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.499
Bye, ALF.

17:50.904 --> 17:52.770
We'll never forget you.

17:56.609 --> 17:58.342
ALF..

17:58.344 --> 18:02.280
ALF...this has been..

18:02.282 --> 18:05.016
...an incredible experience.

18:06.386 --> 18:09.053
You've enriched our lives..

18:09.055 --> 18:12.523
...you've given us a chance
to learn from you.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.859
Thank you, my friend.

18:16.362 --> 18:18.196
So long, Willie.

18:18.198 --> 18:19.530
Goodbye.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.969
Come on, Katie.
Give us a hug.

18:27.807 --> 18:29.140
Goodbye, ALF.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.043
Good luck.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.979
That's all you have to say?

18:36.216 --> 18:38.449
It's a long trip and if you have
to use the bathroom

18:38.451 --> 18:40.151
now would be a good time.

18:41.488 --> 18:44.388
I don't, but thanks
for the concern.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.159
Come on, Brian.
Give us a hug.

18:51.131 --> 18:53.264
Oh, ALF!

18:53.266 --> 18:54.966
Happy birthday, kid.

18:56.069 --> 18:58.169
I love you.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.171
Yeah. Me, too.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.908
Well, I'm in the wind.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.577
<i> Ciao.</i>

19:07.480 --> 19:09.046
<i> Arrivederci.</i>

19:10.683 --> 19:11.983
Goodbye.

19:13.853 --> 19:16.420
And goodnight, Mrs. Ochmonek..

19:17.257 --> 19:19.090
...wherever you are.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.971
[sighs]

19:33.973 --> 19:38.109
It's so strange to have
food here and not have ALF.

19:38.111 --> 19:40.878
Hey, B..

19:40.880 --> 19:42.680
...what do you say
we have a piece of cake?

19:42.682 --> 19:46.350
Not until the spaceship
comes to pick up ALF.

19:46.352 --> 19:49.687
Come on.
Come on over here, son.

19:49.689 --> 19:53.858
He's not even gone yet
and I miss him already.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.826
He was so funny.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.696
Remember the time
he set the shower on fire?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.966
I do. I was in it.

20:01.968 --> 20:05.236
I thought it was funny
when he buried the couch.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.238
I remember.

20:07.240 --> 20:08.806
I was on it.

20:08.808 --> 20:11.142
You remember the time
he was helping change the tire

20:11.144 --> 20:13.511
he pulled the jack
away from the car?

20:13.513 --> 20:16.414
Yeah. I remember.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.982
I was under it.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.253
We all have some
wonderful memories, eh?

20:22.255 --> 20:23.988
He did keep things interesting.

20:23.990 --> 20:27.225
You never knew what he was gonna
say next, what he'd do next

20:27.227 --> 20:28.726
where he'd turn up.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.494
(ALF)
<i> Que pasa?</i>

20:30.496 --> 20:33.664
- ALF!
- ALF, you're back!

20:35.535 --> 20:36.834
ALF, what are you doing here?

20:36.836 --> 20:38.269
Uh, shouldn't you be
on the roof?

20:38.271 --> 20:41.005
I just wanted
to give you your watch back.

20:42.108 --> 20:43.941
It is my watch.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.944
You know, Skip's gonna be by to
pick you up in just 30 seconds!

20:46.946 --> 20:50.448
Well, look it. I forgot to give
Brian his birthday presents.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.116
Oh, that's so sweet.

20:52.118 --> 20:54.885
Here you go, kid.
Melmacian dice.

20:54.887 --> 20:58.356
Every roll's a seven.
You're a winner.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.692
Well, ALF, uh, that's wonderful,
but you're gonna miss your ride!

21:01.694 --> 21:03.527
There's just 13 seconds to go!

21:03.529 --> 21:05.796
Hey, hey, hey. Hold it.
Wait a minute.

21:05.798 --> 21:08.699
Why is everyone trying to
give me the bum's rush here?

21:08.701 --> 21:10.868
I still got
a couple of things I wanna say.

21:10.870 --> 21:14.605
- Ten seconds!
- Let me finish.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.208
Now, I know that, uh..

21:17.210 --> 21:21.145
...I haven't always been what
you might call a model alien.

21:21.147 --> 21:22.913
You're stalling!

21:22.915 --> 21:24.382
Stalling?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.750
Stalling?

21:25.752 --> 21:27.918
- Stalling?
- Stalling!

21:27.920 --> 21:30.554
Are you saying
I'm stalling? Huh?

21:30.556 --> 21:32.290
You think I'd rather
stay here with you guys

21:32.292 --> 21:35.993
than sail across the cosmos
with Skip and..

21:35.995 --> 21:37.161

21:44.137 --> 21:46.604
You missed your ride.

21:46.606 --> 21:49.173
Yeah, I guess I did.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.508
He's staying!

21:50.510 --> 21:52.410
ALF's staying!

21:52.412 --> 21:54.345
You gave up Rhonda for us?

21:54.347 --> 21:58.849
Ah, she'll only want me more
after a couple of centuries.

21:58.851 --> 22:01.152
But aren't you gonna miss her?

22:01.154 --> 22:02.687
Yeah.

22:02.689 --> 22:04.522
But, uh..

22:04.524 --> 22:08.192
...I guess what it
boils down to is..

22:08.194 --> 22:10.061
...I'd miss you more.

22:12.799 --> 22:14.999
You love us that much?

22:16.102 --> 22:17.268
Yeah.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.203
I guess I do.

22:19.205 --> 22:20.938
We love you too, ALF.

22:21.708 --> 22:23.374
We really do.

22:23.376 --> 22:25.076
Let's not get maudlin.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.218
Say, what is that
scratching noise?

22:34.220 --> 22:35.886
What scratching noise?

22:35.888 --> 22:38.656
It's coming from your suitcase.

22:38.658 --> 22:40.358
What suitcase?

22:44.330 --> 22:46.564
Lucky? You bad boy!

22:46.566 --> 22:47.898
What are you doing in there?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.901
I told him no suitcase,
no suitcase!

22:50.903 --> 22:52.336
Oh!

22:52.338 --> 22:54.305
[instrumental music]

22:59.846 --> 23:03.514
You know, ALF, I've had
mixed feelings about you.

23:03.516 --> 23:06.350
But I realize that you
just made a big sacrifice

23:06.352 --> 23:08.252
to stay with us and..

23:08.254 --> 23:10.287
...I'm really touched.

23:13.726 --> 23:17.094
You had mixed feelings about me?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.496
A few.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.264
I had a few about you, too.

23:20.266 --> 23:21.932
- 'Yeah?'
- Yeah.

23:21.934 --> 23:23.768
I still don't feel
properly thanked

23:23.770 --> 23:26.904
for saving you
from that shower fire.

23:26.906 --> 23:30.608
But, uh, we'll talk
about that later.

23:30.610 --> 23:34.044
Right now, I'm bushed.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.046
I'd like to go over
to the couch over here

23:36.048 --> 23:40.117
and lie down for a few days.
Maybe have some soup.

23:40.119 --> 23:44.355
Oh, and another big slab
of that ALF-cake would be great.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.360
Still didn't vacuum this,
