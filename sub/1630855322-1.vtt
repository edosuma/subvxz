WEBVTT

00:02.919 --> 00:06.506
[music playing]

00:37.245 --> 00:38.747
OK.

00:38.788 --> 00:40.665
Now I know you're all ready
to run off to field school,

00:40.707 --> 00:44.169
you've got those big
Indiana Jones daydreams,

00:44.210 --> 00:47.547
unearthing artifacts, outrunning
boulders, looking great

00:47.589 --> 00:49.215
in khaki.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.802
And while field school might
not be quite so adventurous,

00:52.844 --> 00:54.512
it is magical.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.223
That moment when you excavate
an artifact that hasn't

00:57.265 --> 00:59.768
been touched in a millennia--

00:59.809 --> 01:02.645
there really is no
feeling like it.

01:02.687 --> 01:06.524
But always remember the
inherent nature of our job.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.986
Yes, we are part
humanist, part scientist,

01:10.028 --> 01:12.697
but we're also a whole
lot of detective.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.157
So word to the wise--

01:14.199 --> 01:17.744
tread lightly because
once you dig up the past,

01:17.786 --> 01:18.995
it can never be reburied.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.705
[bell rings]

01:20.747 --> 01:24.501
Don't forget to turn in your
thesis, preferably on time.

01:24.542 --> 01:25.085
Thank you.

01:25.126 --> 01:25.627
Great job today.

01:28.963 --> 01:32.676
Ilana [non-english speech]

01:32.717 --> 01:35.637
[non-english speech]

01:37.472 --> 01:39.974
You just said, hello,
your dog is sacrificial.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.935
And I meant every word.

01:41.976 --> 01:43.103
What are you doing here?

01:43.144 --> 01:44.270
You're just stopping
by to say hi?

01:44.312 --> 01:45.730
Well, I was in
the neighborhood

01:45.772 --> 01:49.317
and have a little
end of semester gift.

01:49.359 --> 01:53.154
[gasps] That is so sweet.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.447
Thank you.

01:54.489 --> 01:55.281
It's the--

01:55.323 --> 01:57.534
Evil eye that Mati.

01:57.575 --> 02:00.453
Dates back to at
least ancient Ugarit.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.288
I love that you
know everything.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.957
You didn't love it
when you first met me.

02:03.998 --> 02:05.125
Yes, it did.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.460
I was just flustered.

02:07.502 --> 02:09.295
The most beautiful
woman I had ever met

02:09.337 --> 02:11.423
could also scold me
and wreck antiquities?

02:11.464 --> 02:14.300
And I'm sure you already know
because you know everything.

02:14.342 --> 02:18.805
But the Mati supposedly
protects against misfortune.

02:18.847 --> 02:20.557
Well, then where's yours?

02:20.598 --> 02:21.850
I got you.

02:21.891 --> 02:24.185
Yes, I will protect you.

02:24.227 --> 02:24.978
Thank you.

02:25.020 --> 02:25.770
It's beautiful.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.484
So on a scale from 1 to 10,
what is your stress level

02:31.526 --> 02:34.112
about your mom?

02:34.154 --> 02:36.281
To put it in Greek
mythology, somewhere

02:36.322 --> 02:38.908
between Aphrodite and Medea.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.660
Babe, stop stressing.

02:40.702 --> 02:42.162
I love your mom.

02:42.203 --> 02:44.873
But also, you've only
spent small amounts of time

02:44.914 --> 02:46.583
here in Boston with her.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.336
And staying with her for 10
days while she throws my sister

02:49.377 --> 02:51.921
the most of the talk
Greek wedding history

02:51.963 --> 02:54.215
will be, as we like
to say, a thing.

02:54.257 --> 02:57.177
Well, it'll be a thing I
love because it's your thing.

02:57.218 --> 02:58.887
You'll see.

02:58.928 --> 03:01.806
You'll think My Big Fat Greek
Wedding was a documentary.

03:01.848 --> 03:04.184
[laughs] Or a cautionary tale.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.769
I have to go.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.520
We're surveying a location
for the new Dabo hotel.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.522
OK.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.192
Oh, and don't forget, our
flight tomorrow is at 8:00 AM,

03:12.233 --> 03:14.444
and the airline does
not abide by Greek time.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.863
I'll pick you up at
7:00 AM the latest.

03:16.905 --> 03:18.531
Mike, I'm serious.

03:18.573 --> 03:21.868
[laughs]

03:23.244 --> 03:26.748
[music playing]

03:30.710 --> 03:32.587
Fresh off the racks.

03:32.629 --> 03:34.881
I designed it with
your trip in mind.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.216
Mom, it's beautiful.

03:36.257 --> 03:37.509
I love it.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.677
Thank you.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.055
Now, promise to send
me lots of photos.

03:42.097 --> 03:43.765
I'm just so excited for you.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.058
Me, too.

03:45.100 --> 03:47.435
Beaches and baklava and--

03:47.477 --> 03:48.937
do you remember Katherine Lee?

03:48.978 --> 03:49.979
Yeah, from undergrad?

03:50.021 --> 03:51.731
Yeah.

03:51.773 --> 03:54.109
So she's heading up a field
site near the ancient ruins

03:54.150 --> 03:55.568
of Thera.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.987
So I'll be able to see
her, maybe dig a little.

03:58.029 --> 03:59.572
You'll be in your happy place.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.365
Yeah.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.075
And Mike will be in his.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.411
I mean, as long as he can get
over the stress about his mom.

04:04.452 --> 04:06.996
Yeah, who fortunately
doesn't stress you out at all.

04:07.038 --> 04:08.081
No, not at all.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.916
She's delightful.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.626
And I love Athena.

04:11.668 --> 04:14.045
Just every time I talk to
her, the first thing she says

04:14.087 --> 04:16.923
is, when are you and my
Mikale going to get engaged.

04:16.965 --> 04:20.176
[laughter]

04:20.218 --> 04:22.387
Well, you can't dodge
the question forever.

04:22.429 --> 04:23.346
I'm not dodging it.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.639
It's not been forever.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.266
We've only been dating
a year and a half.

04:26.307 --> 04:27.600
Two years in October.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.602
Two years is not that long.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.521
I mean, you could be with
someone for 10 years.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.273
And one morning,
they wake up and--

04:33.314 --> 04:36.651
Love, I'm well aware.

04:36.693 --> 04:39.821
Look, I just feel like
who you marry is the biggest

04:39.863 --> 04:41.031
decision you make in life.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.032
I know.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.534
And commitment is scary.

04:44.576 --> 04:48.038
But also, I know that avoiding
commitment isn't the solution.

04:48.079 --> 04:49.914
And yes, that's
said by a woman who

04:49.956 --> 04:53.793
hasn't been past a fourth
date in almost three decades.

04:53.835 --> 04:57.422
Hon, look, I'm no
expert at relationships.

04:57.464 --> 05:00.133
But what I do know is you
and Mike have won the lottery

05:00.175 --> 05:01.384
in finding each other.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.636
So don't worry about Athena.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.971
She'll behave.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.181
Just enjoy.

05:06.222 --> 05:07.682
You're going to Greece.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.059
[laughter]

05:09.100 --> 05:09.809
Here.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.435
Oh, yeah.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.187
Can't forget that.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.690
[music playing]

05:21.321 --> 05:24.574
[non-english singing]

05:27.994 --> 05:30.038
I loved Athens when I was there.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.498
But this is--

05:31.539 --> 05:33.291
The best part of Greece?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.417
You'll love the hotel.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.543
I grew up there.

05:35.585 --> 05:37.420
[gasps] Wait a second.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.589
Why didn't they put
this together before?

05:39.631 --> 05:42.342
A charismatic matriarch
running a Grecian isle hotel

05:42.384 --> 05:44.552
while planning her
daughter's wedding.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.347
We are literally entering
the plot of Mamma Mia.

05:47.389 --> 05:48.348
I don't know.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.349
I never saw it.

05:49.391 --> 05:50.892
Wait, what?

05:50.934 --> 05:53.186
Isn't Mamma Mia like a
national treasure in Greece?

05:53.228 --> 05:54.854
You are adorable American.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.606
Wait.

05:56.648 --> 05:58.900
But will there be spontaneous
bursts of dance and song?

05:58.942 --> 05:59.776
Well, we're Greek.

05:59.818 --> 06:02.195
So, probably.

06:02.237 --> 06:05.031
This is going
to be so much fun.

06:05.073 --> 06:06.241
Hold that thought.

06:06.282 --> 06:09.536
[non-english singing]

06:24.509 --> 06:27.512
[non-english speech]

06:27.554 --> 06:29.556
Did all really
come out to greet us?

06:29.597 --> 06:32.851
No, this is just
part of my family.

06:32.892 --> 06:34.185
[non-english speech]

06:36.479 --> 06:39.733
Ilana, I want you to
meet my aunt Maria.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.483
Hi.

06:40.525 --> 06:42.318
And my uncle Yorgos.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.278
Nice to meet you.

06:43.319 --> 06:44.362
You can call him George.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.905
OK.

06:45.947 --> 06:49.200
This is my aunt Eleni
and my uncle Janez, Janez.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.118
Nice to meet you.

06:50.160 --> 06:50.910
John for short.

06:50.952 --> 06:51.870
OK.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.163
And my grandparents.

06:53.204 --> 06:56.458
Papu and Yaya.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.376
May I call you yaya?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.919
Yes.

06:59.961 --> 07:04.507
Why you no come before?

07:04.549 --> 07:08.428
Maybe we die soon.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.305
That's how the
Greek say hello.

07:10.347 --> 07:10.972
Oh, OK.

07:11.014 --> 07:12.265
Ilana!

07:12.307 --> 07:15.268
Ilana, I'm so happy you're here.

07:15.310 --> 07:16.519
What about your big brother?

07:16.561 --> 07:18.605
Yes, yes, you too.

07:18.646 --> 07:21.483
But Ilana finally
gets to meet Chis.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.401
Ilana, this is my
fiancee, Christos.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.778
Pleased to meet you.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.404
I was so sad to miss the
last trip to the states.

07:26.446 --> 07:28.031
Yeah, you were very miss.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.532
Ilana, there you are.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.451
I am so happy to see you.

07:31.493 --> 07:33.119
I thought you would
never come to Greece.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.913
Hi.

07:34.954 --> 07:39.167
Mikale, you finally made time
to come to visit your mother.

07:39.209 --> 07:42.003
There's that famous Greek
guilt I was telling you about.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.421
Ramona.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.048
You're wasting away
without my cooking.

07:45.090 --> 07:46.633
Come, let's see eat.

07:46.675 --> 07:49.177
What about Ilana's family?

07:49.219 --> 07:51.471
Mama, the place looks great.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.306
The work on the
pool is excellent.

07:53.348 --> 07:54.224
Yeah, really.

07:54.265 --> 07:55.934
Your hotel is amazing.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.979
[non-english speech] I always
wanted a hotel on the Caldera.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.900
And my Nikola, may he rest
in peace, built it for me.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.860
It's amazing that he
was a hotel architect,

08:05.902 --> 08:08.488
you're a hotelier, and
you're a hotel developer.

08:08.530 --> 08:10.824
And Alex runs the hotel.

08:10.865 --> 08:13.993
Hospitality is in
the Atlas blood.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.663
Later, I will give you
the whole family history.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.124
[non-english speech]

08:19.165 --> 08:25.672
So we have moussaka, saga
gnocchi, souvlaki, one more,

08:25.714 --> 08:30.135
and I understand it's
your favorite, baklava.

08:30.176 --> 08:33.513
So this is an old family
recipe passed down

08:33.555 --> 08:35.015
through the generations.

08:35.056 --> 08:35.807
Thank you.

08:35.849 --> 08:36.933
That is more than enough.

08:36.975 --> 08:38.018
Come on.

08:38.059 --> 08:38.935
Alex has a table.

08:38.977 --> 08:42.772
Ilana, over here.

08:42.814 --> 08:45.650
So I have
something to ask you.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.944
My cousin Lea is going to
be my [speaking greek]..

08:47.986 --> 08:50.697
That's the Greek
equivalent of maid of honor.

08:50.739 --> 08:53.366
But she won't arrive until
right before the wedding.

08:53.408 --> 08:58.872
So I was hoping you would be
my American maid of honor.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.041
You'd be part of the
ceremony and help me

09:01.082 --> 09:02.334
with wedding duties.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.294
I would love that.

09:04.336 --> 09:05.712
Oh, can I host a
bachelorette party?

09:05.754 --> 09:08.048
Yes, that sounds great.

09:08.089 --> 09:09.424
Thank you.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.551
Hey, what about me,
your [speaking greek]??

09:11.593 --> 09:12.635
I have four brothers.

09:12.677 --> 09:14.804
So the job is already taken.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.390
But you could be my
honorary [speaking greek]..

09:17.432 --> 09:18.600
Just don't tell them.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.727
All of the title,
none of the work.

09:20.769 --> 09:24.564
And I can just watch
my sister get married.

09:24.606 --> 09:27.525
I wish papa was here.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.235
He's here.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.446
And it's one of us.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.614
And he would be proud.

09:38.495 --> 09:39.579
Did she ask you?

09:39.621 --> 09:40.580
Yes, she did.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.706
And of course, I said yes.

09:41.748 --> 09:42.665
So you need a dress.

09:42.707 --> 09:43.708
Tomorrow, we go shopping.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.168
No, no, mama.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.419
Tomorrow, we're going
to [speaking greek]..

09:46.461 --> 09:47.921
OK, I'll make a picnic.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.172
No, mum.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.467
I meant just the two
of us are going, OK?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.469
Oh, forgive me.

09:54.511 --> 09:57.889
I thought you came to Greece
so we could all be together.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.724
Athena, of course, we'd
love for you to come.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.726
See, Ilana wants me to join.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.396
I'm going to go
grab some drinks.

10:04.437 --> 10:07.107
[non-english speech]

10:09.484 --> 10:11.152
Sorry, did you
want some privacy?

10:11.194 --> 10:13.988
Is privacy an
option in this family?

10:14.030 --> 10:17.158
Mama, I didn't
invite you because I

10:17.200 --> 10:20.578
want to propose to Ilana.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.496
Finally.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.081
And Atia castle.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.290
So special.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.334
I'll bring also mama

10:26.376 --> 10:28.837
Mom, I think what
Mikale is trying

10:28.878 --> 10:31.756
to say is that he doesn't
want you third wheeling

10:31.798 --> 10:33.591
his once in a lifetime moment.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.427
Oh, of course.

10:35.468 --> 10:40.557
Because who am I but the woman
who birthed you and raised you

10:40.598 --> 10:43.309
and sacrificed for
you at every turn.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.394
Fine, mom.

10:44.436 --> 10:45.270
Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.022
But give us space, OK?

10:47.063 --> 10:47.522
Of course.

10:47.564 --> 10:48.523
Thank you.

10:48.565 --> 10:49.524
Who's doing the flowers?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.151
Nobody, nobody.

10:51.192 --> 10:55.613
I'm doing this simple,
intimate, my way, hopefully.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.906
I'll still bring a picnic.

10:59.826 --> 11:03.788
You know, you
can say no to her.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.250
How's the wedding
planning going?

11:07.292 --> 11:11.171
OK, I'll come tomorrow
and I'll distract her.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.547
Why not?

11:12.589 --> 11:15.675
We should invite the
rest of the family too.

11:15.717 --> 11:16.760
Can we all fit?

11:19.471 --> 11:22.932
[music playing]

11:28.855 --> 11:31.858
Isn't this just the most
exciting day of your life?

11:31.900 --> 11:34.569
Yeah, I am very
excited to be here.

11:34.611 --> 11:35.862
Mom, come on.

11:35.904 --> 11:37.197
Let's go and explore
a little bit.

11:37.238 --> 11:37.906
Yes, go, go, go.

11:37.947 --> 11:38.740
Have a nice trip, mom.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.033
Bye, bye.

11:40.075 --> 11:40.492
Come on.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.884
As a child, I used to come
here and stare out at the sea

11:57.926 --> 11:59.386
and dream of sailing across it.

12:01.930 --> 12:05.225
I tried to imagine what
my life would be like.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.727
Oh, your shoe's untied.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.729
[gasps] He's proposing.

12:09.771 --> 12:10.438
How romantic.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.403
Congratulations!

12:16.444 --> 12:17.904
What?

12:17.946 --> 12:18.947
From the moment I met
you, I dreamed that you

12:18.988 --> 12:20.365
would get married one day.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.449
Married?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.742
Mom, I haven't proposed yet.

12:22.784 --> 12:23.743
But you were kneeling.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.328
I was taking my shoe.

12:25.370 --> 12:27.205
Well, if you tie your shoe
in the most romantic place

12:27.247 --> 12:29.541
in the world, people are going
to think you're proposing.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.333
Proposing?

12:30.375 --> 12:31.042
Yes!

12:31.084 --> 12:31.418
Mama.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.335
Tea.

12:32.377 --> 12:33.169
Mom, mom, let's go.

12:33.211 --> 12:33.795
Let's go.

12:36.923 --> 12:41.302
So you are proposing?

12:41.344 --> 12:43.263
Yes.

12:43.304 --> 12:48.143
And I was going to say that
this place is also special

12:48.184 --> 12:51.771
because it's where my father
proposed to my mother,

12:51.813 --> 12:55.442
telling her that she was
the light of his life.

12:55.483 --> 13:02.323
And when I met you, I feel the
same, that you are a light,

13:02.365 --> 13:03.199
you're my light.

13:05.785 --> 13:12.208
So Ilana, will you marry me?

13:15.003 --> 13:15.962
Yes.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.505
Yes, of course, I'll marry you.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.012
I have another daughter!

13:24.054 --> 13:26.181
We need to take a picture.

13:26.222 --> 13:26.598
OK.

13:40.987 --> 13:42.322
That was fast.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.199
Congratulations.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.033
Thank you.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.036
And the ring is stunning.

13:48.078 --> 13:50.914
Mike has good taste.

13:50.955 --> 13:53.333
You helped him pick
it out, didn't you?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.501
I did.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.753
He also asked for my blessing.

13:56.795 --> 13:58.838
You knew and you
didn't tell me?

13:58.880 --> 14:00.173
Oh, I'm sorry, hon.

14:00.215 --> 14:02.801
It was the longest
two months of my life.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.011
So are you wedding planning yet?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.055
It's going to take me
time to make your dress.

14:07.097 --> 14:09.057
Mom, we just got engaged.

14:09.099 --> 14:11.851
But the dress takes time.

14:11.893 --> 14:14.312
I know, but there's no rush.

14:14.354 --> 14:17.023
And the dress will be simple,
just like the wedding.

14:17.065 --> 14:20.527
Nothing big or fancy
or complicated.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.195
Are you all right, hon?

14:22.237 --> 14:23.863
Yeah, I'm good.

14:23.905 --> 14:25.490
No, really, I'm good, mom.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.076
It's just-- it's a big decision.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.619
It's a little scary.

14:29.661 --> 14:31.496
But that's OK.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.498
That's normal.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.834
Honey, I know you're worried.

14:35.875 --> 14:38.795
But also, I know Mike
is the man for you.

14:38.837 --> 14:42.090
If he wasn't, I would have made
him pick out a bigger diamond.

14:42.132 --> 14:45.468
[laughs] OK, I don't
fully understand that logic.

14:45.510 --> 14:48.430
But thank you?

14:48.471 --> 14:50.015
Listen, mom, I got to go.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.307
I'll talk to you later, OK?

14:51.349 --> 14:52.308
I love you.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.020
Love you too.

14:55.061 --> 14:58.606
[music playing]

15:05.613 --> 15:08.074
Hey.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.786
Love, I know you think
marriage is the biggest

15:11.828 --> 15:13.538
decision you'll ever make.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.332
And I also know the
thing is the scariest.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.834
Yeah, I do.

15:17.876 --> 15:20.754
And that's OK as
long as you know

15:20.795 --> 15:23.423
that I love you with all of me.

15:23.465 --> 15:27.969
And no matter what happens,
I will never leave.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.096
I don't know if
you can promise that.

15:30.138 --> 15:35.268
Maybe you don't
know, but I do.

15:35.310 --> 15:38.563
Darlings, I started
a wedding schedule

15:38.605 --> 15:40.231
so we can begin planning.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.816
Oh, we don't need to do that.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.193
Oh, yes, we do.

15:43.234 --> 15:44.819
The schedule keeps
everything organized.

15:44.861 --> 15:46.780
No, I mean, we
don't need to start

15:46.821 --> 15:49.407
planning the wedding right now.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.243
This is the most important
day of your life, the day

15:52.285 --> 15:56.039
everything changes, the day that
you bind yourselves together

15:56.081 --> 15:57.999
for all eternity.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.628
A day that should be celebrated,
all stops pulled out,

16:01.670 --> 16:03.421
no expense spared.

16:03.463 --> 16:10.470
So I am going to give you the
biggest Greekest wedding ever.

16:10.512 --> 16:12.639
The biggest
Greekest wedding ever.

16:12.681 --> 16:13.264
Mm-hmm.

16:19.896 --> 16:21.272
I don't know.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.857
Just this whole big fat
Greek wedding thing,

16:22.899 --> 16:24.818
it's not really
what I had in mind.

16:24.859 --> 16:27.487
So what were you thinking?

16:27.529 --> 16:30.824
Maybe a courthouse
ceremony, just something

16:30.865 --> 16:32.325
small and simple.

16:32.367 --> 16:35.245
What about a small
simple wedding in Greece?

16:35.286 --> 16:38.665
You, me, ceremony on the beach.

16:38.707 --> 16:40.250
That does sound beautiful.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.711
But won't your mom
be disappointed?

16:42.752 --> 16:43.962
She'll be OK.

16:44.004 --> 16:45.630
Will you talk to her then?

16:45.672 --> 16:47.632
Because I don't want her to
dislike me just because I'm not

16:47.674 --> 16:49.009
giving her the dream wedding.

16:49.050 --> 16:52.387
One, she could
never dislike you.

16:52.429 --> 16:56.850
Two, it will be a dream
wedding, our dream wedding.

16:56.891 --> 16:59.894
Three, I'll tell
her, don't worry.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.437
Thank you.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.901
[speaking greek] my daughter.

17:06.943 --> 17:12.282
OK, you eat and
then we have to go.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.535
The tailor is waiting
for us at the dress shop.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.912
The maid of honor needs a
special dress for the occasion.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.831
Ah, OK.

17:19.873 --> 17:22.459
I do want to book a restaurant
for Alex's bachelorette,

17:22.500 --> 17:24.210
and I told my friend
that I would meet her

17:24.252 --> 17:26.212
near the ancient
Thera ruins at 1:00.

17:26.254 --> 17:28.131
Well, I can help you
with the restaurant,

17:28.173 --> 17:31.217
plus it's only 10 o'clock.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.053
OK.

17:33.094 --> 17:35.013
Did you by chance talk to Mike?

17:35.055 --> 17:37.265
About what?

17:37.307 --> 17:37.891
Nothing.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.893
Never mind.

17:39.934 --> 17:40.727
Eat.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.353
Oh.

17:44.481 --> 17:47.150
Hey, where are
you going, princess?

17:47.192 --> 17:48.693
Don't you have a job to do?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.362
I'm on my break, mom.

17:50.403 --> 17:51.154
Break, OK.

17:51.196 --> 17:52.822
What are you doing today?

17:52.864 --> 17:56.034
Well, mama wants me to go
see a vineyard for a new hotel.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.535
So it's official.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.371
You're back for two days,
and you're already doing

17:59.412 --> 18:01.081
whatever she wants you to do.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.166
I'm trying to help.

18:03.208 --> 18:04.751
And I know that I can say no.

18:04.793 --> 18:09.464
But I don't see her as
much as you and the guilt--

18:11.966 --> 18:14.761
I miss you a lot.

18:14.803 --> 18:16.554
You could visit us.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.600
Or maybe Chris and I can
come to the States for a bit.

18:20.642 --> 18:21.643
Really?

18:21.685 --> 18:23.228
I can dream.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.605
[phone rings]

18:25.647 --> 18:26.481
We'll talk in a bit.

18:33.571 --> 18:34.531
[speaking greek]

18:37.242 --> 18:39.077
Your dresses in the back.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.286
Oh, it's already picked out?

18:40.328 --> 18:41.871
It has to match
the bridesmaids.

18:41.913 --> 18:43.623
Right.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.876
So while we're here, maybe
we can pick your wedding dress.

18:46.918 --> 18:50.463
Actually, my mom will be
designing my wedding dress.

18:50.505 --> 18:51.548
Really?

18:51.589 --> 18:52.465
For your wedding?

18:52.507 --> 18:53.717
Yeah.

18:53.758 --> 18:56.136
Maybe she design your
rehearsal dinner dress.

18:56.177 --> 18:59.014
No, she'll design my dress.

18:59.055 --> 19:00.890
Of course, of course.

19:00.932 --> 19:03.977
So maybe we look
for inspiration.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.395
There's really no rush.

19:05.437 --> 19:08.982
No rush, but no
[speaking greek]

19:09.024 --> 19:10.984
procrastination.

19:11.026 --> 19:13.319
I never give in to
[speaking greek],, not

19:13.361 --> 19:16.156
with my hotels or my
businesses or my family.

19:16.197 --> 19:19.784
I never waited until tomorrow.

19:19.826 --> 19:25.373
[gasps] This is gorgeous.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.666
It's really not my style.

19:26.708 --> 19:28.585
But you don't know
until you try it on.

19:31.880 --> 19:35.633
It would make me so happy
just to see you in it.

19:35.675 --> 19:40.680
And since we're not going
to dress shop together--

19:40.722 --> 19:43.683
[laughs]

19:50.482 --> 19:54.069
You look like a princess.

19:54.110 --> 19:55.195
Thank you.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.155
It is very pretty.

19:57.197 --> 20:00.200
But no, it's just not
right for the occasion.

20:00.241 --> 20:01.409
What do you mean?

20:01.451 --> 20:04.496
Well, it's just not me.

20:04.537 --> 20:08.541
Maybe it's the new you,
the bride you, the wife you.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.543
Well, the wife me
will still be me.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.087
Oh, that's what
everyone thinks.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.214
But then you get
married and the fabric

20:14.255 --> 20:17.550
of your identity changes.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.427
[laughs]

20:19.469 --> 20:21.262
You're not going
to believe this,

20:21.304 --> 20:25.100
but this looks so much
like my wedding dress.

20:25.141 --> 20:28.311
I can believe that.

20:28.353 --> 20:33.441
To be honest, I think
I'm a little jealous.

20:33.483 --> 20:37.862
I would give anything to
marry my Nikola again.

20:37.904 --> 20:43.451
It's been two years, but
it feels like yesterday.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.870
Two years without him.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.331
Athena, it's lovely.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.251
But my mom's going
to design my dress.

20:51.292 --> 20:51.918
Of course.

20:55.672 --> 20:58.675
It's beautiful.

20:58.717 --> 21:02.595
You are going to be the most
beautiful maid of honor ever.

21:06.975 --> 21:08.143
Oh, no, I'm going to be late.

21:08.184 --> 21:09.352
You can go tomorrow.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.478
Today, we'll go
find a restaurant

21:10.520 --> 21:12.147
for the bachelorette.

21:12.188 --> 21:14.524
OK, let me check
in with my friend.

21:14.566 --> 21:15.984
Oh, I forgot my sunglasses.

21:16.026 --> 21:16.985
I'll be right back.

21:17.027 --> 21:17.610
OK.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.366
Katherine, hi.

21:23.408 --> 21:25.994
No, no, no, I'm actually
running errands with Mike's mom

21:26.036 --> 21:27.162
and I got a little behind.

21:27.203 --> 21:29.330
Could I come see you tomorrow?

21:29.372 --> 21:30.999
OK, great.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.208
Yeah, see you around noon.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.043
All right, bye.

21:33.084 --> 21:33.835
Everything OK?

21:33.877 --> 21:35.295
Yeah.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.339
You see, in Greece,
people are more relaxed.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.923
America is so uptight.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.843
Everyone rushing to be
somewhere at a specific time.

21:41.885 --> 21:45.138
Yeah, respecting people's
time is so American.

21:45.180 --> 21:47.515
So during the
day, this taverna

21:47.557 --> 21:49.601
is the best bakery in Santorini.

21:49.642 --> 21:52.771
But at night, it is the place
to be, the only place to have

21:52.812 --> 21:53.605
the bachelorette.

21:53.646 --> 21:55.231
I'm sure it's very cute.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.608
And they know our family well.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.360
So they will take
good care of us.

21:58.401 --> 21:59.361
I can book it.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.362
Oh, don't worry about it.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.529
I'll handle the booking.

22:01.571 --> 22:02.864
And wait till
you try the food.

22:02.906 --> 22:05.116
And the coffee is the
best in Santorini.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.786
I bet it's delicious, but
I actually cannot do coffee

22:07.827 --> 22:08.828
in the afternoon.

22:08.870 --> 22:10.205
I will order you
a cup just in case.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.539
I really rather not.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.208
But you don't know
until you've had it.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.376
Come on.

22:14.417 --> 22:17.921
[music playing]

22:23.051 --> 22:25.553
So what do you think the coffee?

22:25.595 --> 22:27.263
The baklava is amazing.

22:27.305 --> 22:29.474
It's good, but mine is better.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.767
I will teach you.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.602
It is a tradition
for Greek mothers

22:32.644 --> 22:35.230
to teach the daughters-in-law
their son's favorite dishes.

22:35.271 --> 22:36.272
A lot of Greek traditions.

22:36.314 --> 22:37.065
I know.

22:37.107 --> 22:38.566
It's very special.

22:38.608 --> 22:42.737
And what about your
family, your traditions?

22:42.779 --> 22:44.322
Let's see.

22:44.364 --> 22:48.201
My mom designs all my dresses
for all my big life occasions.

22:48.243 --> 22:51.246
And every year on my birthday,
for as long as I can remember,

22:51.287 --> 22:54.874
we go to the same Italian
restaurant and eat baked ziti.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.919
And every year on Christmas Eve,
we open our presents at night

22:57.961 --> 23:00.755
and then spend all of
Christmas morning baking.

23:00.797 --> 23:05.135
Yes, but what about cultural
traditions, religious, wedding

23:05.176 --> 23:07.053
traditions.

23:07.095 --> 23:08.304
I don't-- I don't know.

23:08.346 --> 23:09.431
I have to ask my mom.

23:09.472 --> 23:10.932
Maybe her mom did something.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.435
And what about your
father's side of the family?

23:13.476 --> 23:15.228
I'm not sure.

23:15.270 --> 23:20.108
I mean, I haven't seen or spoken
to my dad since I was eight.

23:20.150 --> 23:21.943
Do you think about him?

23:21.985 --> 23:23.319
Not often.

23:23.361 --> 23:24.779
I mean, he left
when I was so young.

23:24.821 --> 23:26.239
So--

23:26.281 --> 23:27.699
I'm sorry.

23:27.741 --> 23:30.118
You didn't have the
father you deserve.

23:30.160 --> 23:34.289
But it's his loss because he
missed out on the best thing--

23:34.330 --> 23:35.999
you.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.292
Thank you.

23:37.334 --> 23:39.419
And my Nikola
would have loved you.

23:39.461 --> 23:40.128
You think?

23:40.170 --> 23:40.920
Of course.

23:40.962 --> 23:42.088
You're amazing.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.924
Plus, all a parent
wants is for their child

23:44.966 --> 23:47.927
to meet someone that loves
them as much as they do.

23:47.969 --> 23:50.972
And I count my blessings
that both my children

23:51.014 --> 23:53.475
have found that.

23:53.516 --> 24:00.023
And as for your dad, I
know, these wounds hurt.

24:00.065 --> 24:03.234
But they heal when you
have your own children.

24:03.276 --> 24:06.446
And I can't wait
for my grandbabies.

24:06.488 --> 24:09.699
Little Nikola.

24:09.741 --> 24:12.160
You've already named
my unborn children.

24:12.202 --> 24:12.994
No, no, no, no.

24:13.036 --> 24:13.953
It's what we do.

24:13.995 --> 24:14.913
It's tradition.

24:14.954 --> 24:15.538
Yeah.

24:18.166 --> 24:19.459
Is everything all right?

24:19.501 --> 24:20.710
I think it's the caffeine.

24:25.548 --> 24:27.676
[non-english singing]

24:32.389 --> 24:33.348
Ilana.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.350
Oh, my god, you're so cute!

24:35.392 --> 24:37.477
Our olive oil tasting
has just started.

24:37.519 --> 24:38.978
Would you like to try some?

24:39.020 --> 24:39.979
That sounds lovely.

24:40.021 --> 24:41.022
Can you sit with me?

24:41.064 --> 24:43.066
Sure.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.526
I am my own boss.

24:44.567 --> 24:47.862
But don't tell my mom,
who's my actual boss.

24:47.904 --> 24:52.200
Speaking of, I heard you spent
the entire day with my mother.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.368
How did that go?

24:53.410 --> 24:55.370
I know she can be a lot.

24:55.412 --> 24:58.039
Well, it, comes
from love, right?

24:58.081 --> 25:01.751
Oh, and don't forget her
managably high expectations.

25:01.793 --> 25:02.794
Of you?

25:02.836 --> 25:05.922
Of everyone, but
especially of me.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.758
You know, I run this hotel,
go to business school,

25:08.800 --> 25:11.261
grow the empire, get
married, have babies

25:11.302 --> 25:12.929
all at the same time.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.889
Do you want to do all of that?

25:14.931 --> 25:16.808
I would just like
for my entire life

25:16.850 --> 25:19.185
to not be planned out.

25:19.227 --> 25:21.771
Chris and I want to
travel, go to the states.

25:21.813 --> 25:24.274
You should do that.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.317
It's not so simple.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.944
I can't just leave her.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.446
Oh.

25:29.487 --> 25:30.238
Hello, my love.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.197
Hello.

25:31.239 --> 25:32.532
What did you do today?

25:32.574 --> 25:35.744
I went to the other
side of the island

25:35.785 --> 25:38.913
to look at the property
my mom is interested in.

25:38.955 --> 25:39.998
There you are.

25:40.040 --> 25:41.332
I have good news.

25:41.374 --> 25:43.168
I just spoke to the church,
and they have booked

25:43.209 --> 25:45.628
January the seventh for us.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.713
For us to do what?

25:46.755 --> 25:48.048
For us get married, of course.

25:48.089 --> 25:50.425
Seven is a very lucky
number for the Greeks.

25:50.467 --> 25:51.801
It's the only day
to get married.

25:51.843 --> 25:53.762
And this church is very special.

25:53.803 --> 25:55.638
It's where Nikola
and I got married,

25:55.680 --> 25:57.766
it's where Alex and Chris
are getting married,

25:57.807 --> 25:59.851
this church is tradition,
and as you know,

25:59.893 --> 26:02.228
tradition is very important.

26:02.270 --> 26:06.941
Ilana, the Atlas' are named
after the Titan Atlas who

26:06.983 --> 26:09.444
was tasked to carry the
weight of the heavens

26:09.486 --> 26:11.112
on his shoulders.

26:11.154 --> 26:14.616
So Atlas means to carry, so
we carry on the tradition.

26:14.657 --> 26:17.994
Well, I'm sure that we
would love to do that.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.120
Yeah, mom.

26:19.162 --> 26:21.664
But also, Ilana and
I need to discuss.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.169
Discuss, yeah.

26:29.714 --> 26:33.218
[music playing]

26:37.222 --> 26:39.641
So I'm confused.

26:39.683 --> 26:41.101
What is there to discuss?

26:41.142 --> 26:43.603
I thought we agreed on
a small simple ceremony.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.355
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

26:45.397 --> 26:46.856
My mom overstepped.

26:46.898 --> 26:48.441
She shouldn't be
booking our wedding

26:48.483 --> 26:49.859
without asking us first.

26:49.901 --> 26:52.737
She shouldn't be booking
our wedding at all.

26:52.779 --> 26:54.698
I'll talk to her.

26:54.739 --> 27:00.078
But also, maybe, maybe
we shouldn't be so

27:00.120 --> 27:03.498
quick to say not to the church.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.042
But I don't want
a big wedding.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.128
But we can have
a small wedding,

27:08.169 --> 27:12.966
something intimate, more
personal, memorable.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.051
Let's visit the church tomorrow.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.303
Please, please, please, say yes?

27:17.345 --> 27:18.513
OK.

27:18.555 --> 27:19.097
Thank you.

27:23.226 --> 27:28.189
Do you remember what you said
to me when I first kissed you?

27:28.231 --> 27:30.567
After I recovered
from swooning.

27:30.608 --> 27:31.735
Exactly, exactly.

27:31.776 --> 27:34.779
You said-- let me--

27:34.821 --> 27:40.326
OK, Mike, Mike, where
did you come from.

27:40.368 --> 27:42.245
I did not say it like that.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.246
No, I didn't.

27:43.288 --> 27:44.080
Yeah, you said it.

27:44.122 --> 27:45.915
No, I didn't.

27:45.957 --> 27:49.753
And I think you
said that I just

27:49.794 --> 27:52.589
stepped out of your dreams.

27:52.630 --> 27:55.717
Look at me, look at me now.

27:55.759 --> 27:58.928
Maybe I did, I have.

27:58.970 --> 28:01.348
Well, that's how I felt.

28:01.389 --> 28:03.975
You mean how you still feel.

28:04.017 --> 28:05.602
Yes, how I still feel.

28:05.643 --> 28:07.562
I stand corrected.

28:07.604 --> 28:10.815
And I know what you're trying to
get at, that where you're from

28:10.857 --> 28:12.442
is better than any
dream possible.

28:19.449 --> 28:20.533
Swoon.

28:20.575 --> 28:23.495
[laughter]

28:28.541 --> 28:29.793
There you are, my daughter.

28:29.834 --> 28:31.836
You keep sleeping so late.

28:31.878 --> 28:33.797
Well, I am on
vacation, Athena.

28:33.838 --> 28:36.383
Vacation when we have
a wedding in a week

28:36.424 --> 28:37.509
and errands to run.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.968
Actually, I have plans today.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.762
I told my friend I'd
meet her at the dig site.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.764
Maybe you go this afternoon.

28:42.806 --> 28:46.976
Athena, I have plans today.

28:47.018 --> 28:49.479
OK, you have plans.

28:49.521 --> 28:51.648
No problem.

28:51.690 --> 28:55.110
[music playing]

29:06.705 --> 29:09.249
OK.

29:09.290 --> 29:11.334
Hey, you're here.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.669
It's so good to see you.

29:12.711 --> 29:14.337
What's it been
like, three years?

29:14.379 --> 29:15.839
No, no.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.799
We saw each other briefly
at that conference in LA

29:17.841 --> 29:18.675
like a year ago.

29:18.717 --> 29:19.968
Yeah, sorry.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.387
So much history,
so little memory.

29:22.429 --> 29:23.930
Oh, what's all this?

29:23.972 --> 29:26.975
Well, we found the first
shard a couple of months ago

29:27.017 --> 29:30.311
and the second one
just last week.

29:30.353 --> 29:34.691
It looks like an
amphora, Circa 500 BCE.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.317
How'd you take
that so quickly?

29:36.359 --> 29:40.196
Well, the female figure,
well, the folds in her clothing

29:40.238 --> 29:44.200
follow a chiton dress
dating to around 500 BCE.

29:44.242 --> 29:45.618
Exactly.

29:45.660 --> 29:46.911
So can I help?

29:46.953 --> 29:48.455
You're on vacation.

29:48.496 --> 29:51.124
Trust me, this would be a
vacation from my vacation.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.542
All right, well, have these.

29:52.584 --> 29:53.501
Thank you.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.712
And we'll make a start.

29:55.754 --> 29:59.174
[music playing]

30:02.927 --> 30:04.387
You're late.

30:04.429 --> 30:05.889
I'm sorry.

30:05.930 --> 30:08.725
But I heard that being
on time is very American.

30:08.767 --> 30:10.560
Sounds like my mother.

30:10.602 --> 30:13.271
[non-english speech]

30:18.777 --> 30:22.864
Father Adinos christened me, and
he's marrying Alex and Chris.

30:22.906 --> 30:23.823
Welcome.

30:23.865 --> 30:24.741
Thank you.

30:24.783 --> 30:26.576
The church looks lovely.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.410
[speaking greek]

30:27.452 --> 30:30.955
[music playing]

30:42.425 --> 30:46.262
So a small simple
ceremony might work there.

30:46.304 --> 30:46.805
Really?

30:46.846 --> 30:48.306
Maybe.

30:48.348 --> 30:51.559
I mean, it mean something,
special to you, to us.

30:51.601 --> 30:52.852
It's history.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.312
It's the history
that's getting to you.

30:57.649 --> 30:59.359
Where are we going?

30:59.401 --> 31:02.237
You didn't think this trip was
going to be all wedding tasks

31:02.278 --> 31:04.447
and managing my crazy
family, did you?

31:04.489 --> 31:06.950
I mean, where would
I get that idea from?

31:06.991 --> 31:09.786
You're saying you're
not enjoying the family

31:09.828 --> 31:11.121
dysfunction.

31:11.162 --> 31:13.331
I am enjoying it
because I agree with you.

31:13.373 --> 31:17.085
And you put fun in
dysfunction, my love.

31:17.127 --> 31:21.464
[speaking greek],, you're
saying the sweetest words.

31:21.506 --> 31:24.134
[non-english speech]

31:26.678 --> 31:28.555
This is my fiancee, Ilana.

31:28.596 --> 31:29.806
Ilana, so happy to meet you.

31:29.848 --> 31:30.515
Nice to meet you.

31:30.557 --> 31:30.890
Come aboard.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.642
OK.

31:32.684 --> 31:34.853
Thank you.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.187
[speaking greek]

31:36.229 --> 31:37.480
Are you ready for some fun?

31:37.522 --> 31:38.064
Yeah.

31:38.106 --> 31:40.817
[speaking greek]

31:40.859 --> 31:43.028
[non-english singing]

31:48.366 --> 31:50.827
Petrus and I are friends
from [speaking greek],,

31:50.869 --> 31:52.287
elementary school.

31:52.328 --> 31:54.539
As students, we used
to steal my father's boat

31:54.581 --> 31:56.207
and go fishing.

31:56.249 --> 31:59.836
Now my kids take my boat,
and I pretend not to notice.

31:59.878 --> 32:01.004
Well, I don't blame them.

32:01.046 --> 32:02.839
Your boat is beautiful.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.050
[speaking greek]

32:10.055 --> 32:11.681
I bet you miss this, huh?

32:11.723 --> 32:14.142
Sure, but I take a lot
of sailing in Boston.

32:14.184 --> 32:16.269
But it's nothing like this.

32:16.311 --> 32:20.357
You know, my dad
taught me to sail.

32:20.398 --> 32:25.403
Most of the time, it would
be just me and him out here.

32:25.445 --> 32:31.284
And although he's always with
me, I feel him more here.

32:46.091 --> 32:48.176
So if my mom gets
the vineyard, she's

32:48.218 --> 32:50.387
going to build a
hotel around it.

32:50.428 --> 32:53.973
Speaking of, have you been
able to talk to her yet?

32:54.015 --> 32:54.724
I'm sorry.

32:54.766 --> 32:56.226
I didn't.

32:56.267 --> 32:57.477
I thought we were
figuring out what we want.

32:57.519 --> 32:58.269
Oh.

32:58.311 --> 33:00.397
Yeah, no, no, no, we are.

33:00.438 --> 33:02.357
I mean, I guess I never
really thought I would

33:02.399 --> 33:05.068
be considering the church, so--

33:05.110 --> 33:07.779
And maybe I do want
to have a Greek wedding.

33:10.407 --> 33:14.744
I realize that
this is part of me.

33:14.786 --> 33:18.957
In the States, I always have
the feeling of being separate.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.583
You never told me that before.

33:20.625 --> 33:23.378
I spent many years
being Greek Mike.

33:23.420 --> 33:26.673
But here, I am just
[speaking greek]..

33:26.715 --> 33:29.342
And I want to be married
that's who I really am.

33:29.384 --> 33:34.139
Well, I definitely want you
to feel seen, especially by me.

33:34.180 --> 33:37.267
But our wedding does need
to be about both of us.

33:37.308 --> 33:43.231
Yes, but part of us is
me, and part of me is this.

33:43.273 --> 33:45.483
And I want the same
for you, for you

33:45.525 --> 33:48.862
to feel represented and seen.

33:48.903 --> 33:51.114
I appreciate you saying that.

33:51.156 --> 33:54.284
We'll figure it out.

33:54.325 --> 33:57.287
Where's your mother necklace?

33:57.328 --> 33:59.080
Oh, no, it must
have fallen off.

33:59.122 --> 34:00.915
What?

34:00.957 --> 34:02.292
OK, doesn't matter.

34:02.334 --> 34:05.253
We'll buy you another one.

34:15.388 --> 34:18.099
No, I'm happy that he's
sharing this with me.

34:18.141 --> 34:21.519
I just-- I wonder why
he never told me before,

34:21.561 --> 34:24.522
that he feels like Greek
Mike, that he feels separate.

34:24.564 --> 34:26.816
I mean, does that mean that
he feels separate from me

34:26.858 --> 34:31.196
because I don't fully know
him or understand him?

34:31.237 --> 34:34.032
Of course, he
doesn't mean that.

34:34.074 --> 34:36.534
It's just a lot.

34:36.576 --> 34:41.456
The big family, big
cultures, big personalities.

34:41.498 --> 34:43.375
Just feels like there's
a prescribed way

34:43.416 --> 34:46.044
to do everything,
especially with weddings.

34:46.086 --> 34:48.713
Well, that's tradition.

34:48.755 --> 34:52.676
Speaking of tradition, do we
have any special Albas family

34:52.717 --> 34:56.054
traditions?

34:56.096 --> 34:59.057
Ziti birthdays,
Christmas baking?

34:59.099 --> 35:00.392
No, I know those.

35:00.433 --> 35:04.771
I mean cultural or
historical or religious.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.940
Was there something
that you did that was

35:06.981 --> 35:10.819
special at your wedding or--

35:10.860 --> 35:12.904
I'm sorry, never mind.

35:12.946 --> 35:14.030
No.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.783
I just feel that
love, weddings--

35:16.825 --> 35:20.578
well, maybe I'm not the best
person to be asking for advice.

35:20.620 --> 35:23.998
That's not very
comforting, mom.

35:24.040 --> 35:27.544
[music playing]

35:30.005 --> 35:32.007
[non-english speech]

35:34.718 --> 35:37.595
[laughter]

35:37.637 --> 35:39.848
What's so funny?

35:39.889 --> 35:41.224
It's just an old Greek joke.

35:41.266 --> 35:44.185
I love a good joke.

35:44.227 --> 35:46.813
OK, [speaking greek]

35:46.855 --> 35:49.774
[speaking greek] So
the cow has the lamb,

35:49.816 --> 35:51.818
do you want to go out
with me on Easter.

35:51.860 --> 35:57.198
And lamb response, no,
I can't, I'm spinning.

35:57.240 --> 35:58.283
OK, it's a bad joke.

35:58.324 --> 35:59.701
It's hilarious in Greek.

35:59.743 --> 36:01.161
I bet.

36:01.202 --> 36:02.120
Ilana.

36:02.162 --> 36:03.455
Yes.

36:03.496 --> 36:09.252
Why you no make us
great grandbabies.

36:09.294 --> 36:11.838
Maybe we die soon.

36:11.880 --> 36:13.715
They say this to everyone.

36:13.757 --> 36:15.342
[speaking greek]

36:16.593 --> 36:19.137
So what should we do today?

36:19.179 --> 36:20.388
Go to the beach, hiking?

36:20.430 --> 36:22.140
Ilana, there you are.

36:22.182 --> 36:25.310
You sleep so late,
like a teenager.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.145
They've all been
waiting to meet you.

36:27.187 --> 36:28.063
Oh, you know what?

36:28.104 --> 36:29.773
That would be lovely.

36:29.814 --> 36:31.191
Except I booked a tasting at the
taverna for the bachelorette.

36:31.232 --> 36:32.609
I will come with you.

36:32.650 --> 36:33.860
They will take good care
of you if I'm there.

36:33.902 --> 36:34.986
You know what, that's OK.

36:35.028 --> 36:36.321
No, no, I want
to help, really.

36:36.363 --> 36:37.739
And Mikale can come too.

36:43.578 --> 36:46.039
[non-english speech]

36:49.542 --> 36:52.504
Mama, Ilana's got it.

36:52.545 --> 36:55.799
I think it is so fun
that you're hosting this.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.593
A bachelorette party--
it's so American.

37:02.055 --> 37:02.722
Excuse me.

37:02.764 --> 37:03.598
I'm sorry.

37:03.640 --> 37:04.182
This isn't what we ordered.

37:04.224 --> 37:05.475
Yes, it is.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.601
This is for the
bachelorette cake.

37:06.643 --> 37:08.311
Well, what about the dinner?

37:08.353 --> 37:11.189
Oh, I finalized that yesterday
when you were with your friend.

37:11.231 --> 37:12.816
Now we just pick dessert.

37:12.857 --> 37:14.067
Oh.

37:14.109 --> 37:17.529
And as we're
here, why don't you

37:17.570 --> 37:18.863
pick the cake for your wedding?

37:22.242 --> 37:24.244
Mama, is this a cake tasting?

37:24.285 --> 37:26.454
Well, we're tasting cake.

37:26.496 --> 37:28.581
But we're tasting
cake because you booked

37:28.623 --> 37:31.543
us a cake tasting, right?

37:31.584 --> 37:33.211
I'm just trying to help.

37:33.253 --> 37:36.548
Mama, this is
Ilana and my wedding.

37:36.589 --> 37:37.716
I'm overstepping.

37:37.757 --> 37:38.341
I'm sorry.

37:38.383 --> 37:40.135
I always do this.

37:40.176 --> 37:43.388
But I'm just a silly
old Greek widow

37:43.430 --> 37:46.766
who just loves her
children too much.

37:46.808 --> 37:49.227
Mama, we know that
you are trying to help.

37:49.269 --> 37:50.520
But it's too much.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.814
OK, I'll do better.

37:52.856 --> 37:54.274
I promise.

37:54.315 --> 37:57.777
But as we're here,
let's eat some cake.

38:03.616 --> 38:05.410
So which cake you like the best?

38:05.452 --> 38:06.536
The chocolate.

38:06.578 --> 38:07.579
Really, not the strawberry?

38:07.620 --> 38:08.955
No, it was very sweet.

38:08.997 --> 38:10.206
OK.

38:10.248 --> 38:11.332
You know, I'm
going to go order

38:11.374 --> 38:12.542
the flowers for
the bachelorette?

38:12.584 --> 38:14.085
I already ordered them.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.754
Oh.

38:15.795 --> 38:17.547
Well, then I'm going to go
pick out the party favors.

38:17.589 --> 38:19.007
I can come with you.

38:19.049 --> 38:21.426
No, you know, I'd really
love some alone time.

38:21.468 --> 38:22.427
Alone time.

38:22.469 --> 38:25.638
Another American concept.

38:25.680 --> 38:26.681
See you.

39:00.340 --> 39:01.800
Hi.

39:01.841 --> 39:03.635
I'm picking up a dress
for the Atlas wedding.

39:03.677 --> 39:06.262
It's very purple.

39:06.304 --> 39:09.474
Yes, I have it here.

39:09.516 --> 39:11.518
Yep, that's the one.

39:11.559 --> 39:14.896
Also, your other
dress is ready.

39:14.938 --> 39:15.730
What other dress?

39:19.192 --> 39:19.901
This one.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.280
OK.

39:24.322 --> 39:24.864
Thank you.

39:29.369 --> 39:30.954
Ilana, there you are.

39:30.995 --> 39:33.498
Did you buy me a wedding
dress when I asked you not to?

39:33.540 --> 39:34.708
You said you liked it.

39:34.749 --> 39:36.042
No, you said you liked it.

39:36.084 --> 39:37.961
I said my mom is going
to design my dress.

39:38.003 --> 39:40.588
Well, maybe she can make your
dress for different special--

39:40.630 --> 39:42.757
Athena, please, you need
to respect my boundaries.

39:42.799 --> 39:46.219
Ilana, I don't
mean to upset you.

39:46.261 --> 39:47.554
You know I love you.

39:47.595 --> 39:49.514
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

39:49.556 --> 39:52.183
But don't you think you're
being a little dramatic?

39:52.225 --> 39:53.351
Dramatic.

39:53.393 --> 39:54.352
Oh, so now you're
gaslighting me?

39:54.394 --> 39:55.478
What's going on here?

39:55.520 --> 39:56.980
Ilana says I'm lampgasing her.

39:57.022 --> 39:57.814
Gaslighting.

39:57.856 --> 39:58.356
Gaslining.

39:58.398 --> 40:00.025
Gaslighting.

40:00.066 --> 40:01.026
What does it even mean?

40:01.067 --> 40:02.569
It means you take
every situation,

40:02.610 --> 40:05.864
and you twist it so that
you end up the victim.

40:05.905 --> 40:07.365
Is what do you think of me?

40:07.407 --> 40:08.700
No.

40:08.742 --> 40:10.910
No, Athena, I know
you mean well, OK?

40:10.952 --> 40:12.328
But you need to
return the dress.

40:17.584 --> 40:20.045
Are you OK?

40:20.086 --> 40:22.213
I'm sorry about my mom.

40:22.255 --> 40:23.715
I was worried about this.

40:23.757 --> 40:25.759
Look, I understand that
she has good intentions.

40:25.800 --> 40:27.719
But she's driving me crazy.

40:27.761 --> 40:29.512
And this doesn't seem
like an issue that's

40:29.554 --> 40:30.847
going to go away when we leave.

40:40.857 --> 40:42.567
I'd like to hear what you think.

40:42.609 --> 40:44.235
Yeah.

40:44.277 --> 40:47.280
Well, this cupid-like figure
is most certainly arrows.

40:47.322 --> 40:48.365
That's what I thought too.

40:48.406 --> 40:48.948
Yeah.

40:48.990 --> 40:49.574
Can I?

40:49.616 --> 40:51.951
Yeah, of course.

40:51.993 --> 40:56.081
This female figure is probably
Eros' mother Aphrodite.

40:56.122 --> 40:59.459
So it could be the
Aphrodite arrow psyche men.

40:59.501 --> 41:00.960
Yeah.

41:01.002 --> 41:02.462
Wouldn't know without
the rest of the pieces.

41:02.504 --> 41:03.254
Well, let's find them.

41:03.296 --> 41:03.797
All right.

41:10.762 --> 41:13.848
I feel bad you're spending
your vacation working.

41:13.890 --> 41:15.475
Don't.

41:15.517 --> 41:18.937
It feels so good to be back on
a dig site, especially with you.

41:18.978 --> 41:22.315
And Mike's family
is wonderful, but it

41:22.357 --> 41:23.942
is nice to have a little break.

41:23.983 --> 41:24.818
Oh.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.861
What's the gossip?

41:26.903 --> 41:29.864
Nothing, just some
drama with his mom.

41:29.906 --> 41:32.659
Oh, what's she like?

41:32.701 --> 41:39.165
She's vivacious and
fierce and has a huge heart

41:39.207 --> 41:41.209
and has already named
my unborn children.

41:41.251 --> 41:42.711
[laughter]

41:42.752 --> 41:44.629
And I understand that
Mike's in a tough spot.

41:44.671 --> 41:49.884
But it's strange to
see him like this.

41:49.926 --> 41:51.511
Anyway, enough about me.

41:51.553 --> 41:52.303
What about you?

41:52.345 --> 41:53.805
How's life here?

41:53.847 --> 41:55.682
Yeah, it's good.

41:55.724 --> 41:57.559
I mean, I've been
here two years.

41:57.600 --> 41:59.519
I love Greece.

41:59.561 --> 42:03.940
But also, I'm very
ready to leave.

42:03.982 --> 42:06.860
I've lived on three different
continents in the last 10

42:06.901 --> 42:09.821
years, and my sister and
her kids and my parents

42:09.863 --> 42:12.574
are all in Rhode
Island, and Brown

42:12.615 --> 42:15.452
has a faculty spot opening up.

42:15.493 --> 42:17.037
You're going to teach?

42:17.078 --> 42:20.665
Well, I'm only past my first
interview, but hopefully.

42:20.707 --> 42:22.042
You love teaching, right?

42:22.083 --> 42:24.002
Yeah, I love it.

42:24.044 --> 42:27.172
But I actually have the
opposite story of you.

42:27.213 --> 42:30.467
So I did my field year in
Egypt and some dig trips.

42:30.508 --> 42:33.219
But otherwise, I've pretty
much always been in Boston.

42:33.261 --> 42:34.971
I wish I would have
been on site more.

42:35.013 --> 42:37.390
Well, the sand
is always sandier.

42:54.324 --> 42:57.452
Ilana, can I speak to you?

42:57.494 --> 43:02.082
I want to apologize for
gasolining you yesterday.

43:02.123 --> 43:02.916
I know.

43:02.957 --> 43:04.501
I can be a little--

43:04.542 --> 43:07.420
what's the word-- over--

43:07.462 --> 43:08.338
Overbearing?

43:08.380 --> 43:09.756
No.

43:09.798 --> 43:13.343
Overly sensitive to
other people's feelings.

43:13.385 --> 43:17.597
It's because I love so much.

43:17.639 --> 43:21.643
I've been a mother for decades,
but I'm only just now learning

43:21.685 --> 43:23.603
how to be a mother-in-law.

43:23.645 --> 43:26.564
So please be patient with me.

43:26.606 --> 43:27.899
Of course.

43:27.941 --> 43:31.027
Also, I returned the dress.

43:31.069 --> 43:34.280
I didn't get a full refund
because I had it altered,

43:34.322 --> 43:38.118
but that was my doing.

43:38.159 --> 43:39.411
Are you hungry?

43:39.452 --> 43:40.620
Lunch is being served.

43:40.662 --> 43:41.913
I'll be up in a bit.

43:41.955 --> 43:45.333
[music playing]

43:53.174 --> 43:53.591
So pretty.

43:56.720 --> 43:59.305
So these will be for the tables.

43:59.347 --> 44:01.808
What do you think?

44:01.850 --> 44:03.560
Yeah, they're nice.

44:03.601 --> 44:05.729
My mom likes carnations.

44:05.770 --> 44:09.566
Did your mom make all the
decisions for your wedding?

44:09.607 --> 44:10.483
What?

44:10.525 --> 44:11.860
No, nothing.

44:11.901 --> 44:13.695
I just-- seems like she
has a pretty big impact

44:13.737 --> 44:15.113
on your choices.

44:15.155 --> 44:16.823
Doesn't your mom
have an impact?

44:16.865 --> 44:18.533
Yeah, of course.

44:18.575 --> 44:19.993
I mean, my mom's my best friend.

44:20.035 --> 44:20.910
So--

44:20.952 --> 44:23.955
Your best friend?

44:23.997 --> 44:25.665
This is just the way it is.

44:25.707 --> 44:29.377
[speaking greek] I'm sure my mom
told you Atlas means to carry.

44:29.419 --> 44:32.213
So we carry on with
our traditions and also

44:32.255 --> 44:34.341
the sacrifices
that go with them.

44:34.382 --> 44:35.216
It's a lot to carry.

44:42.057 --> 44:44.559
Sorry, but I want to redo it.

44:44.601 --> 44:48.521
I'll use the carnations for
the in, but for my wedding,

44:48.563 --> 44:49.356
I want the roses.

44:57.781 --> 44:58.490
Suits you.

44:58.531 --> 44:59.115
Really?

44:59.157 --> 44:59.532
No.

44:59.574 --> 44:59.991
Atlas.

45:02.452 --> 45:03.036
We're here.

45:05.622 --> 45:07.165
We'll meet you guys inside.

45:07.207 --> 45:08.708
OK.

45:08.750 --> 45:11.461
I thought we could use this.

45:11.503 --> 45:12.295
A Mati bracelet.

45:16.966 --> 45:20.512
I'll protect you,
and you protect me?

45:20.553 --> 45:21.096
Promise.

45:24.265 --> 45:25.392
One's missing.

45:25.433 --> 45:26.351
That's OK.

45:26.393 --> 45:27.727
It's not a big deal.

45:27.769 --> 45:29.896
No, it's a bad omen.

45:29.938 --> 45:31.690
Well, it would be if
we were superstitious.

45:31.731 --> 45:33.358
Luckily, we're not.

45:33.400 --> 45:36.986
I will protect you even
with one bead missing.

45:37.028 --> 45:38.446
I would love that.

45:43.660 --> 45:45.704
This is a Stefana, a crown.

45:45.745 --> 45:47.247
It's for the crowning
ceremony which

45:47.288 --> 45:49.082
is the highlight of
the Greek wedding.

45:49.124 --> 45:52.210
They're connected by a ribbon
to symbolize a union, two

45:52.252 --> 45:54.963
lives becoming one in eternity.

45:55.005 --> 45:58.717
Because what is bound
can never be unbound.

45:58.758 --> 46:01.761
Well, unless you
cut the ribbon.

46:01.803 --> 46:02.887
I'm kidding.

46:02.929 --> 46:03.763
I was kidding.

46:03.805 --> 46:05.015
[laughter]

46:05.056 --> 46:07.559
So which crown is yours?

46:07.600 --> 46:09.102
I don't know.

46:09.144 --> 46:10.895
I think I like this one.

46:10.937 --> 46:13.481
And it does go with
my wedding dress.

46:13.523 --> 46:17.736
But we kind of like this one,
something a bit more simple,

46:17.777 --> 46:19.446
you know?

46:19.487 --> 46:22.157
So what do you think?

46:22.198 --> 46:23.366
I think it's our wedding.

46:33.376 --> 46:36.463
So if my mom
gets this property,

46:36.504 --> 46:41.134
this will be her next
hotel, nestled on a winery.

46:41.176 --> 46:43.678
There are definitely easier
properties to develop,

46:43.720 --> 46:46.306
but this has history.

46:46.348 --> 46:49.934
My dad took my mom grape
picking here on the first date.

46:49.976 --> 46:51.519
That's so special.

46:51.561 --> 46:53.730
I'm a little bit jealous
of your family's connection

46:53.772 --> 46:54.856
to Santorini.

46:54.898 --> 46:57.275
Your history is entwined.

46:57.317 --> 46:58.985
It's like you have
a sense of place,

46:59.027 --> 47:00.153
a commitment to the past.

47:00.195 --> 47:02.030
That's what
tradition is, right?

47:04.449 --> 47:07.285
Then your mom asked me about
my family's traditions,

47:07.327 --> 47:09.871
and it made me realize
that I don't really

47:09.913 --> 47:11.998
know a lot about my
dad or his family

47:12.040 --> 47:14.542
or that whole side
of my history.

47:14.584 --> 47:16.169
And it never used
to bother me before,

47:16.211 --> 47:18.254
but now I think it kind of does.

47:18.296 --> 47:20.340
I've always
wondered how you're

47:20.382 --> 47:24.010
so interested in the past
and yet not your own.

47:24.052 --> 47:26.346
It's not that
I'm not interested.

47:26.388 --> 47:30.183
It's just that it's always
been, you know, kind of painful.

47:33.645 --> 47:34.813
We'll make her own history.

47:38.733 --> 47:42.362
This is Ana Cirtico, a
special wine from Santorini.

47:42.404 --> 47:48.368
It's unique because of the
mineral content of the soil.

47:48.410 --> 47:50.870
I just realized that if
we get this property,

47:50.912 --> 47:52.831
we can make our own wine.

47:52.872 --> 47:56.042
We as in like you and me we
or like you and your mom we?

47:56.084 --> 47:58.128
Well, I'll help my mom.

47:58.169 --> 47:59.671
Yeah, I know.

47:59.713 --> 48:01.297
But can you do that remotely?

48:01.339 --> 48:05.218
I hope so, but I don't know.

48:05.260 --> 48:07.345
What are you trying to say?

48:07.387 --> 48:10.640
Just that something
shifting in me,

48:10.682 --> 48:13.518
and I want to be honest
about how I'm feeling.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.188
Well, I appreciate
you being honest.

48:17.230 --> 48:18.606
Thank you for understanding.

48:24.612 --> 48:27.741
[speaking greek],,
would you like a drink?

48:27.782 --> 48:30.910
Why, thank you.

48:30.952 --> 48:32.954
Where did you come from?

48:32.996 --> 48:35.081
Where did you come from?

48:35.123 --> 48:40.462
Straight from Mount
Olympus into your arms.

48:40.503 --> 48:44.632
Can we just stay like
this and stare at each other

48:44.674 --> 48:46.676
the rest of the night?

48:46.718 --> 48:48.636
That sounds wonderful.

48:56.144 --> 48:57.896
Our latest discovery.

48:57.937 --> 48:58.980
Mount Olympus?

48:59.022 --> 49:00.315
That's my guess.

49:00.357 --> 49:03.068
So we have Aphrodite
and Eros probably

49:03.109 --> 49:05.612
at Aphrodite's palace
on Mount Olympus.

49:05.653 --> 49:07.155
What is that?

49:07.197 --> 49:08.531
It could be another figure.

49:08.573 --> 49:09.157
Possibly.

49:09.199 --> 49:10.992
Maybe Psyche.

49:11.034 --> 49:12.994
But we need to find
the rest to be sure.

49:13.036 --> 49:14.287
You want to dig today?

49:14.329 --> 49:15.830
I wish I could.

49:15.872 --> 49:17.457
But I told Mike I'd spend
the afternoon with him,

49:17.499 --> 49:19.000
and then I'm hosting Alex's
bachelorette tonight.

49:19.042 --> 49:20.001
Oh, no worries.

49:20.043 --> 49:22.712
I'll walk you out.

49:22.754 --> 49:25.215
So some good news.

49:25.256 --> 49:28.009
I scheduled my second
interview with Brown.

49:28.051 --> 49:29.511
Very exciting.

49:29.552 --> 49:30.428
Yeah.

49:30.470 --> 49:31.304
I mean, it's two three rounds.

49:31.346 --> 49:33.306
But if this goes well--

49:33.348 --> 49:36.267
but also, I decided that
whether or not I get the job,

49:36.309 --> 49:38.895
I'm definitely heading back
to the States in the fall.

49:38.937 --> 49:40.146
Who's going to
replace you here?

49:40.188 --> 49:41.064
I don't know.

49:41.106 --> 49:42.440
Do you want to apply?

49:42.482 --> 49:43.900
You're more than qualified.

49:43.942 --> 49:45.151
I mean, that would be amazing.

49:45.193 --> 49:46.152
But I don't think I can.

49:46.194 --> 49:47.737
Why?

49:47.779 --> 49:49.280
You always said you wish
to spend more time on site.

49:49.322 --> 49:51.449
Yeah, but my whole
life's in Boston, you know.

49:51.491 --> 49:53.743
My mom, my friends, my job.

49:53.785 --> 49:56.204
And things are much
better with Mike's mom.

49:56.246 --> 49:58.748
But they'll be even better
with ocean between us.

49:58.790 --> 49:59.749
[laughter]

49:59.791 --> 50:00.709
Gotcha.

50:00.750 --> 50:01.167
I'll see you.

50:01.209 --> 50:02.335
See you.

50:08.758 --> 50:11.302
There she is, our
American maid of honor.

50:11.344 --> 50:12.846
We're doing our job.

50:12.887 --> 50:14.389
What's all this?

50:14.431 --> 50:16.683
[speaking greek] They're
candy for the wedding guests.

50:16.725 --> 50:17.892
It's a Greek custom.

50:17.934 --> 50:19.769
That's so sweet, pun intended.

50:19.811 --> 50:20.937
[laughter]

50:20.979 --> 50:21.938
Here, I'll set you up.

50:21.980 --> 50:22.522
OK.

50:27.485 --> 50:31.072
Also, I wanted to
tell you, Chris and I

50:31.114 --> 50:32.615
discussed our
travel plans again.

50:32.657 --> 50:35.076
And he wants to do it, like now.

50:35.118 --> 50:36.119
Wow.

50:36.161 --> 50:37.454
I know.

50:37.495 --> 50:39.956
But is it crazy to
just leave our lives

50:39.998 --> 50:42.584
and go to another country
and not know where we'll be?

50:42.625 --> 50:43.335
No.

50:43.376 --> 50:45.003
I mean, Mike did it.

50:45.045 --> 50:48.340
Yeah, but that's the problem.

50:48.381 --> 50:50.008
What do you mean?

50:50.050 --> 50:54.095
I mean, I'm afraid that my
mom will be worried that Chris

50:54.137 --> 50:55.930
and I will do what Mike did.

50:55.972 --> 50:56.806
Why?

50:56.848 --> 50:58.433
What did Mike do?

50:58.475 --> 51:01.770
Well, after my
father passed, Mike

51:01.811 --> 51:05.106
told my mom that he would finish
his year in Boston, his job,

51:05.148 --> 51:06.274
and then come back home.

51:06.316 --> 51:07.692
But then he met you.

51:07.734 --> 51:13.281
So-- anyway, should
I talk to her?

51:13.323 --> 51:15.116
Yes, definitely.

51:15.158 --> 51:16.534
I mean, she'll understand.

51:16.576 --> 51:19.120
Or she'll understand in time.

51:19.162 --> 51:20.705
Look, it's your life, right?

51:30.590 --> 51:34.594
So I wanted to tell you that
I changed the wedding flowers.

51:34.636 --> 51:35.720
Why?

51:35.762 --> 51:38.056
Because I realized
that I want roses.

51:38.098 --> 51:40.016
OK, carnations are tradition.

51:40.058 --> 51:42.977
But if you want roses, fine.

51:43.019 --> 51:48.024
Also, Chris and I will be
taking a break from the hotel.

51:48.066 --> 51:49.567
To do what?

51:49.609 --> 51:54.989
To go to the States, do
something different, only

51:55.031 --> 51:56.408
for a little bit.

51:56.449 --> 51:59.327
And I can get you an
entry manager if you want.

51:59.369 --> 52:01.413
I don't want a manager.

52:01.454 --> 52:05.041
I want a daughter, my daughter.

52:05.083 --> 52:10.005
Alex I know, this is a
time of change and change

52:10.046 --> 52:11.381
can be confusing.

52:11.423 --> 52:16.845
But your life is here,
your job, your family.

52:16.886 --> 52:21.224
You know, Ilana said something
interesting about her mom.

52:21.266 --> 52:23.435
She said that her mom
is her best friend.

52:23.476 --> 52:25.520
What an American concept.

52:25.562 --> 52:27.522
Parents are not
supposed to be friends.

52:27.564 --> 52:30.442
They're supposed to be parents.

52:30.483 --> 52:32.402
Oh, it's a real estate agent.

52:40.243 --> 52:44.080
My love, you cannot drink ouzo
in front of this view and look

52:44.122 --> 52:44.873
so serious.

52:44.914 --> 52:47.709
What's wrong?

52:47.751 --> 52:48.626
Nothing.

52:48.668 --> 52:53.006
It's just something Alex said.

52:53.048 --> 52:55.800
Did you stay in Boston for me?

52:55.842 --> 52:57.302
What do you mean?

52:57.344 --> 52:59.346
I mean, if you hadn't
met me, would you

52:59.387 --> 53:00.555
have moved back to Greece?

53:00.597 --> 53:03.350
I mean, this is home.

53:03.391 --> 53:04.726
Did you always feel this way?

53:04.768 --> 53:06.728
Did you always know that
you would move back here

53:06.770 --> 53:08.980
and you just didn't tell me?

53:09.022 --> 53:10.231
Ilana, I didn't lie to you.

53:10.273 --> 53:11.274
I never lied to you.

53:11.316 --> 53:12.692
I know.

53:12.734 --> 53:15.236
I'm just wondering
why we never talked

53:15.278 --> 53:18.281
about this stuff
before, where we'd live,

53:18.323 --> 53:20.950
our wedding, what we
envision for our future.

53:20.992 --> 53:22.077
Are you having doubts?

53:22.118 --> 53:24.412
No.

53:24.454 --> 53:25.914
Really, no.

53:25.955 --> 53:31.711
But if you're worried,
you just have to tell me.

53:31.753 --> 53:33.421
I know.

53:33.463 --> 53:36.966
[music playing]

53:42.389 --> 53:42.972
Hi.

53:43.014 --> 53:44.432
Hi!

53:44.474 --> 53:46.601
This is my cousin
in Canberra, Lea.

53:46.643 --> 53:47.811
She just arrived.

53:47.852 --> 53:49.229
I've heard so much about you.

53:49.270 --> 53:50.772
Lovely to meet you.

53:50.814 --> 53:53.817
Thank you for letting me
temporarily do your job.

53:53.858 --> 53:56.319
My Obada and my maid of honor.

53:56.361 --> 53:59.447
Now I'm ready to get married.

53:59.489 --> 54:02.158
Oh, and Ilana, thank
you so much for this.

54:02.200 --> 54:04.077
It's perfect, even
if you're making

54:04.119 --> 54:06.162
me wear this ridiculous crown.

54:06.204 --> 54:10.125
It's an American tradition,
as our embarrassing toasts.

54:10.166 --> 54:11.126
So--

54:11.167 --> 54:12.961
Please, no toasts.

54:13.003 --> 54:17.465
Everyone, if I could
please have your attention.

54:17.507 --> 54:20.468
Alex, I have always
wanted a sister.

54:20.510 --> 54:22.053
And now I finally have one.

54:22.095 --> 54:23.972
Yamas to that.

54:24.014 --> 54:25.348
Yamas!

54:25.390 --> 54:28.309
Yamas.

54:28.351 --> 54:35.650
Alexandra, my dreams came true
when God gave me a daughter.

54:35.692 --> 54:38.903
But I'm very happy to
share that in addition

54:38.945 --> 54:42.699
to being my daughter
from now, you will also

54:42.741 --> 54:47.454
be my business partner
because my offer on Gavaros

54:47.495 --> 54:49.289
was accepted.

54:49.330 --> 54:55.545
Mikale, Alexandra, and I
will do this thing together

54:55.587 --> 54:57.339
as partners.

54:57.380 --> 55:00.884
[applause]

55:13.938 --> 55:16.566
Ilana, this is news to me too.

55:16.608 --> 55:19.110
But are you going into a
partnership with your mom

55:19.152 --> 55:20.403
here in Santorini?

55:20.445 --> 55:22.030
I just found out about this.

55:22.072 --> 55:24.824
I don't even know what
being partners means.

55:24.866 --> 55:27.243
But don't you think this is
all part of her plan to get

55:27.285 --> 55:29.245
you to move back to Greece?

55:29.287 --> 55:30.413
Maybe.

55:30.455 --> 55:34.501
But maybe it's not a bad thing.

55:34.542 --> 55:37.337
And maybe we can moved
here for a year or two.

55:37.379 --> 55:38.672
I knew this was coming.

55:38.713 --> 55:40.382
Because it makes sense.

55:40.423 --> 55:43.176
How does it make sense when
our entire life is in Boston?

55:43.218 --> 55:46.805
But our life isn't in
Boston because part of my life

55:46.846 --> 55:48.473
is here.

55:48.515 --> 55:50.225
Is it too much to ask
for you to come here

55:50.266 --> 55:51.643
with me for a year or two?

55:51.685 --> 55:53.895
No, no, it's not
too much to ask.

55:53.937 --> 55:57.440
It just everything here
is yours, your home,

55:57.482 --> 55:59.275
your language, your family.

55:59.317 --> 56:02.654
And it would be me relying
on you for all of that.

56:02.696 --> 56:06.700
But isn't that what
a relationship is?

56:06.741 --> 56:10.745
Us relying on each other.

56:20.505 --> 56:21.840
Again, you sleep so late.

56:21.881 --> 56:23.925
I've been waiting
for you to wake up.

56:23.967 --> 56:26.177
I'm making baklava for
after the rehearsals,

56:26.219 --> 56:27.429
and I want to teach you.

56:27.470 --> 56:28.888
Well, actually,
I'm looking for Mike.

56:28.930 --> 56:30.807
He's gone to Gavaros to
meet with the contractors.

56:30.849 --> 56:31.891
He'll be home soon.

56:31.933 --> 56:34.185
So we have time to make baklava.

56:34.227 --> 56:35.937
That is a very nice dress.

56:35.979 --> 56:36.646
Thank you.

56:36.688 --> 56:39.691
My mom made it for me.

56:39.733 --> 56:41.359
It's great.

56:41.401 --> 56:43.528
I get to teach you the way
my mother-in-law taught me.

56:43.570 --> 56:45.613
No, no, no, you put
butter every time.

56:45.655 --> 56:47.657
Right, butter.

56:47.699 --> 56:50.243
Ooh, my mother-in-law.

56:50.285 --> 56:51.327
She was tough.

56:51.369 --> 56:52.454
You can't imagine.

56:52.495 --> 56:53.913
Well, I think I can.

56:53.955 --> 56:56.499
We were two very
strong personalities.

56:56.541 --> 56:59.502
We butt heads a lot which
was a waste because I wanted

56:59.544 --> 57:00.837
us to get along, you know.

57:00.879 --> 57:02.839
I wanted us to have
a good relationship.

57:02.881 --> 57:07.510
But it was very hard, especially
after she came to live with us.

57:07.552 --> 57:09.220
She lived with you?

57:09.262 --> 57:11.514
Oh, yes after Nikola's father
died, she moved in with us.

57:11.556 --> 57:13.808
It's the Greek way.

57:13.850 --> 57:15.894
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
no, you need more feeling.

57:15.935 --> 57:18.313
You know, actually, I like
it with a little less filling.

57:18.355 --> 57:19.689
It makes it crispier.

57:19.731 --> 57:22.317
Yes, but this recipe
needs extra filling.

57:22.359 --> 57:23.443
[speaking greek]

57:23.485 --> 57:24.986
[speaking greek]

57:25.028 --> 57:26.363
Hi.

57:26.404 --> 57:29.574
Ah, baklava.

57:29.616 --> 57:33.244
So much filling
just how I like it.

57:33.286 --> 57:34.496
I'm stealing you away.

57:34.537 --> 57:35.121
Oh.

57:35.163 --> 57:35.872
Wait.

57:35.914 --> 57:37.624
Hey, hey, we're baking.

57:37.665 --> 57:40.543
Well, we will be
right back-lava.

57:40.585 --> 57:41.503
Bye.

57:41.544 --> 57:42.837
Bye.

57:42.879 --> 57:45.006
Actually, we won't.

57:45.048 --> 57:45.423
Kids.

57:49.594 --> 57:51.805
I was up all night thinking.

57:51.846 --> 57:56.601
And Ilana, I love you.

57:56.643 --> 57:58.436
And I know we have
a lot to figure out.

57:58.478 --> 58:01.064
But it doesn't
change how I feel.

58:01.106 --> 58:05.902
So I was thinking, what if we
forget about the wedding drama?

58:05.944 --> 58:07.737
You mean like not get married?

58:07.779 --> 58:10.490
No, no, I meant elope.

58:10.532 --> 58:12.283
We don't have to plan or wait.

58:12.325 --> 58:14.577
We can just do it now.

58:14.619 --> 58:15.745
Like right now?

58:15.787 --> 58:17.330
Maybe not this exact minute.

58:17.372 --> 58:18.790
But why not?

58:18.832 --> 58:20.917
You can't just
suddenly get married.

58:20.959 --> 58:22.711
We've been together
almost two years.

58:22.752 --> 58:24.254
Two years is not that long.

58:24.295 --> 58:26.506
Plus, we're in the middle
of arguing about a wedding

58:26.548 --> 58:27.882
and where we're going to live.

58:27.924 --> 58:29.467
I didn't think
we were arguing.

58:29.509 --> 58:30.760
I thought we were discussing.

58:30.802 --> 58:32.137
That's what my
parents used to say.

58:32.178 --> 58:34.931
But Ilana, we're
not your parents.

58:34.973 --> 58:37.183
And I know that
divorce was messy

58:37.225 --> 58:39.728
and your dad leaving
was horrible.

58:39.769 --> 58:43.273
But I'm not him, I won't leave.

58:43.314 --> 58:45.275
How can you know that?

58:45.316 --> 58:51.156
I know you love me, and I
know that you guard yourself.

58:51.197 --> 58:53.116
And I'm trying to be patient.

58:53.158 --> 58:56.745
But I don't know how
much longer I can wait.

58:56.786 --> 58:57.746
Much longer you?

58:57.787 --> 58:59.497
Just proposed a week ago.

58:59.539 --> 59:01.916
It's not about the proposal.

59:01.958 --> 59:07.881
It seems like I'm trying
to convince you to love me.

59:07.922 --> 59:09.507
Let's get to the reharsal.

59:13.720 --> 59:15.472
So what did you think?

59:15.513 --> 59:17.474
Maybe New York or Boston?

59:17.515 --> 59:18.725
Too cold.

59:18.767 --> 59:19.434
California.

59:19.476 --> 59:20.268
Too hot.

59:20.310 --> 59:20.977
Hi.

59:21.019 --> 59:22.771
You look beautiful.

59:22.812 --> 59:24.481
Oh, how are you feeling?

59:24.522 --> 59:25.815
You nervous?

59:25.857 --> 59:27.484
Well, I am a
little bit nervous.

59:27.525 --> 59:30.278
I'm nervous about the actual
wedding and the guests.

59:30.320 --> 59:31.905
And I feel like I'm
forgetting things

59:31.946 --> 59:33.073
and I'm getting things wrong.

59:33.114 --> 59:38.078
But about Chris,
I'm not nervous.

59:38.119 --> 59:42.832
He's probably the only thing I'm
completely sure of in my life.

59:42.874 --> 59:43.541
Excuse me.

59:54.803 --> 59:58.973
In Greek weddings,
everything has a meaning.

59:59.015 --> 01:00:01.726
The priest starts
with a brief welcome.

01:00:01.768 --> 01:00:04.646
Then the blessing of the rings.

01:00:04.688 --> 01:00:09.150
You bless the rings three
times, then come the Stefana.

01:00:09.192 --> 01:00:10.777
With the ribbon you can't cut.

01:00:10.819 --> 01:00:17.784
Never ever never never
until the end of time.

01:00:17.826 --> 01:00:22.706
Then the wine for the
sharing of their lives.

01:00:22.747 --> 01:00:26.710
And finally, it's a yes dance.

01:00:26.751 --> 01:00:33.216
These are the first steps of
a couple as husband and wife.

01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:35.427
I never knew you were
such a traditional guy.

01:00:35.468 --> 01:00:37.721
Do I surprise you?

01:00:37.762 --> 01:00:39.514
Yeah, I think you do.

01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:01.327
Ilana, are you all right?

01:01:04.205 --> 01:01:07.917
No, actually,
I'm not all right.

01:01:07.959 --> 01:01:09.919
What's wrong?

01:01:09.961 --> 01:01:12.672
I don't know.

01:01:12.714 --> 01:01:14.591
Two years we've
been together, and I

01:01:14.632 --> 01:01:17.093
feel like I'm just now
discovering things about Mike

01:01:17.135 --> 01:01:20.597
that I never knew,
like who he really is.

01:01:20.638 --> 01:01:23.308
And he's a wonderful man.

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.644
But how could I have not
seen these things before?

01:01:26.686 --> 01:01:29.272
It's all just a
bit overwhelming.

01:01:29.314 --> 01:01:34.527
Our cultures, our
upbringings, the family--

01:01:34.569 --> 01:01:36.696
You're saying it's us.

01:01:36.738 --> 01:01:39.908
No, no, that is
not what I'm saying.

01:01:39.949 --> 01:01:43.161
Ilana, I love you.

01:01:43.203 --> 01:01:45.455
I love you, Athena.

01:01:45.497 --> 01:01:47.707
And I know you love me.

01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:51.544
But if we're really being
honest with ourselves,

01:01:51.586 --> 01:01:53.421
I feel like there was
always a piece of you

01:01:53.463 --> 01:01:56.508
that really felt like I
would never fully fit in

01:01:56.549 --> 01:01:57.258
with your family.

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:04.849
And maybe now I'm
starting to wonder

01:02:04.891 --> 01:02:06.518
if you were really right.

01:02:06.559 --> 01:02:09.354
Ilana, no.

01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:12.982
I did have my doubts, but
they were never about you

01:02:13.024 --> 01:02:15.485
not belonging.

01:02:15.527 --> 01:02:19.781
It was about you not
wanting to belong.

01:02:19.823 --> 01:02:22.992
I always get the feeling that
you want to keep yourself

01:02:23.034 --> 01:02:27.163
apart, distant from us.

01:02:27.205 --> 01:02:31.751
My son loves you desperately.

01:02:31.793 --> 01:02:34.129
He would do anything for you.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.256
And yet whenever I
see you two together,

01:02:36.297 --> 01:02:39.342
it's always like you're
keeping him at an arm's length

01:02:39.384 --> 01:02:41.845
like you do the rest of us.

01:02:41.886 --> 01:02:44.514
Correct me if I'm wrong.

01:02:44.556 --> 01:02:48.685
No, I didn't realize
I was doing that.

01:02:48.727 --> 01:02:50.854
I'm really sorry.

01:02:50.895 --> 01:02:53.273
I know I'm not easy.

01:02:53.314 --> 01:02:56.901
But I'm just trying
to get close to you.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:59.529
Mike is lucky to have you.

01:02:59.571 --> 01:03:01.239
He needs his family.

01:03:01.281 --> 01:03:06.119
Ilana, you're his family.

01:03:06.161 --> 01:03:08.580
Or you're supposed to be.

01:03:28.058 --> 01:03:29.726
You look stunning.

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:30.268
Thanks.

01:03:32.896 --> 01:03:34.981
What?

01:03:35.023 --> 01:03:38.026
It's just, my mom
picked this dress.

01:03:38.068 --> 01:03:40.653
And I wonder what
would I have picked

01:03:40.695 --> 01:03:43.114
if it had been my choice.

01:03:43.156 --> 01:03:44.616
Well, that's a
good question to ask.

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.744
And it still is your
choice, unless it's

01:03:47.786 --> 01:03:49.120
too late to replace the dress.

01:03:49.162 --> 01:03:51.122
Then just remember
that there'll be

01:03:51.164 --> 01:03:52.624
plenty of choices
to be made ahead.

01:03:58.380 --> 01:03:59.464
Hey you.

01:03:59.506 --> 01:04:01.966
Hey.

01:04:02.008 --> 01:04:02.967
Are you feeling all right?

01:04:03.009 --> 01:04:03.677
Mm.

01:04:03.718 --> 01:04:05.387
You sure?

01:04:05.428 --> 01:04:08.098
Ilana, I have a
surprise for you.

01:04:08.139 --> 01:04:11.976
More family has arrived.

01:04:12.018 --> 01:04:13.895
Mom?

01:04:13.937 --> 01:04:14.813
What?

01:04:14.854 --> 01:04:15.980
How were you here?

01:04:16.022 --> 01:04:17.315
Oh, Athena called
me yesterday,

01:04:17.357 --> 01:04:18.817
or I guess still today for me.

01:04:18.858 --> 01:04:19.776
I don't know when it is.

01:04:19.818 --> 01:04:21.486
I'm jetlagged.

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:24.155
Anyways, Athena called me
and asked me to the wedding.

01:04:24.197 --> 01:04:25.448
We are happy you are here.

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:27.200
Oh.

01:04:27.242 --> 01:04:28.993
Athena, thank you.

01:04:29.035 --> 01:04:30.787
My pleasure.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:33.164
But don't forget, we invited
you to the wedding months ago.

01:04:33.206 --> 01:04:33.832
Oh, I know.

01:04:33.873 --> 01:04:35.333
Thank you.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:36.459
But I would have felt
like I was intruding.

01:04:36.501 --> 01:04:37.711
There is no
intruding with family.

01:04:37.752 --> 01:04:38.503
Watch out.

01:04:38.545 --> 01:04:40.380
She means it.

01:04:40.422 --> 01:04:42.507
So what are we doing today?

01:04:42.549 --> 01:04:44.342
Well, I was going
to go to the dig site

01:04:44.384 --> 01:04:46.302
and Katherine finally
assembled the amphora.

01:04:46.344 --> 01:04:47.137
Do you want to come?

01:04:47.178 --> 01:04:49.014
Of course.

01:04:49.055 --> 01:04:50.390
Athena, do you want to come?

01:04:50.432 --> 01:04:51.850
Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm fine.

01:04:51.891 --> 01:04:55.020
I have so much to do for
the welcome dinner tonight.

01:04:55.061 --> 01:04:57.105
Please come.

01:04:57.147 --> 01:04:57.731
OK.

01:05:01.568 --> 01:05:04.571
So it is Psyche
accomplishing the fourth task.

01:05:04.612 --> 01:05:05.196
I'm lost.

01:05:05.238 --> 01:05:06.614
Catch me up.

01:05:06.656 --> 01:05:08.074
Well, Aphrodite was
the goddess of love

01:05:08.116 --> 01:05:10.035
who had a son named Eros.

01:05:10.076 --> 01:05:12.495
And Psyche was a
beautiful mortal woman.

01:05:12.537 --> 01:05:14.497
Who Eros fell
madly in love with.

01:05:14.539 --> 01:05:16.708
And they married and
they lived very happily

01:05:16.750 --> 01:05:19.044
until she betrayed
Eros trust and then

01:05:19.085 --> 01:05:20.879
he moved back with his mother.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:24.632
Forcing Psyche to Aphrodite's
palace to beg for Eros back.

01:05:24.674 --> 01:05:29.054
So clever Aphrodite, she sets
Psyche for impossible tasks

01:05:29.095 --> 01:05:30.388
to win Eros back.

01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:33.099
But Psyche accomplished
the task, the fourth one

01:05:33.141 --> 01:05:34.934
being to descend
into the underworld

01:05:34.976 --> 01:05:38.063
and bringing back a box of
beauty ointment for Aphrodite.

01:05:38.104 --> 01:05:39.606
And then what happened?

01:05:39.647 --> 01:05:42.400
Well, Zeus rewarded Psyche
by turning her into a God

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:44.277
so she could live with
Eros on Mount Olympus.

01:05:44.319 --> 01:05:46.071
So it was a
happily ever after.

01:05:46.112 --> 01:05:49.407
Not for Aphrodite.

01:05:49.449 --> 01:05:51.493
Speaking of moving
to Mount Olympus,

01:05:51.534 --> 01:05:55.288
did you give any more thought
to apply into the job?

01:05:55.330 --> 01:05:57.332
Oh, I'm trying to
get Ilana to apply

01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:58.875
for my job to replace me here.

01:06:05.965 --> 01:06:06.800
Hey, Chris.

01:06:06.841 --> 01:06:08.218
Have you seen Mike?

01:06:08.259 --> 01:06:09.761
Yeah.

01:06:09.803 --> 01:06:11.805
Last I saw, he went for
a walk to your viewpoint.

01:06:11.846 --> 01:06:12.430
Thank you.

01:06:23.149 --> 01:06:24.025
Hey.

01:06:24.067 --> 01:06:25.235
Hey you.

01:06:25.276 --> 01:06:28.238
I was hoping
I'd find you here.

01:06:28.279 --> 01:06:30.490
Did your mom talk to you?

01:06:30.532 --> 01:06:31.991
Talk to me about what?

01:06:32.033 --> 01:06:33.618
Oh.

01:06:33.660 --> 01:06:37.997
So Katherine is
leaving her field site,

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:40.291
and she suggested that I apply.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.418
That could be perfect.

01:06:45.839 --> 01:06:47.298
Sorry.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:49.801
When did this happen?

01:06:49.843 --> 01:06:50.969
A few days ago.

01:06:51.011 --> 01:06:52.887
And you didn't tell me?

01:06:52.929 --> 01:06:54.723
Well, I wanted time
to think about it.

01:06:57.809 --> 01:06:59.185
OK.

01:06:59.227 --> 01:07:01.813
I have to get ready
for the welcome dinner.

01:07:01.855 --> 01:07:02.814
Sorry.

01:07:02.856 --> 01:07:03.398
Mike.

01:07:13.992 --> 01:07:14.701
May I?

01:07:14.743 --> 01:07:17.162
Please, sit.

01:07:17.203 --> 01:07:19.039
Thank you again for having me.

01:07:21.916 --> 01:07:25.670
Honestly, you don't know
how happy I am you are here.

01:07:25.712 --> 01:07:28.214
Well, I'm grateful
that you offered.

01:07:28.256 --> 01:07:31.718
You know, Ilana has
a strong personality.

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:35.347
She doesn't like to let on
when she's having a tough time.

01:07:35.388 --> 01:07:37.349
But she's also never
been very good at hiding

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:38.683
what she's feeling.

01:07:38.725 --> 01:07:40.185
We love Ilana.

01:07:40.226 --> 01:07:42.520
She's going to be
part of our family.

01:07:42.562 --> 01:07:44.564
We want her to be happy.

01:07:44.606 --> 01:07:46.191
I know.

01:07:46.232 --> 01:07:48.068
It's just she's never
had a big family.

01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:49.319
It's all new to her.

01:07:49.361 --> 01:07:52.197
So it'll be quite an adjustment.

01:07:52.238 --> 01:07:54.407
So how is Mike doing?

01:07:54.449 --> 01:07:58.203
Oh, he's hiding it
too, and he's good at it.

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:01.456
But a mother knows.

01:08:01.498 --> 01:08:03.124
He's confused.

01:08:03.166 --> 01:08:04.668
He's concerned.

01:08:04.709 --> 01:08:07.003
Why do they have to
make it so difficult, eh?

01:08:07.045 --> 01:08:09.255
They certainly put
us through turmoil.

01:08:09.297 --> 01:08:10.924
We're parents.

01:08:10.965 --> 01:08:13.802
We love when they love,
we hurt when they hurt,

01:08:13.843 --> 01:08:16.471
and we know when
our child needs us.

01:08:16.513 --> 01:08:18.556
And so we pray that
we can guide them.

01:08:18.598 --> 01:08:20.850
Yeah, we just nudge them
in the right direction

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:23.937
to make sure that they find
the happiness they deserve.

01:08:23.978 --> 01:08:27.399
You understand me exactly.

01:08:27.440 --> 01:08:31.236
It's tough, this parent thing.

01:08:31.277 --> 01:08:32.529
If only they knew.

01:08:54.467 --> 01:08:57.637
You look beautiful.

01:08:57.679 --> 01:09:01.099
And tomorrow, you
start a new chapter.

01:09:01.141 --> 01:09:06.062
You make a home, a family,
partner in the hotel.

01:09:06.104 --> 01:09:11.276
No, that's not going
to happen, at least

01:09:11.317 --> 01:09:13.737
not when you want it to.

01:09:13.778 --> 01:09:15.989
Chris and I are
going to the states.

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:19.117
You're leaving me?

01:09:19.159 --> 01:09:19.951
You're my daughter.

01:09:19.993 --> 01:09:21.244
You're an Atlas.

01:09:21.286 --> 01:09:22.662
Yes.

01:09:22.704 --> 01:09:24.789
And the Atlas' were
burdened with carrying

01:09:24.831 --> 01:09:26.875
the weight of the world
on their shoulders.

01:09:26.916 --> 01:09:28.418
I know.

01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:30.086
Well, that's what
being your daughter

01:09:30.128 --> 01:09:33.131
feels like sometimes, like I've
got the weight of the world

01:09:33.173 --> 01:09:36.217
on my shoulders.

01:09:36.259 --> 01:09:38.219
I'm your mother.

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.471
Yeah.

01:09:39.512 --> 01:09:41.181
But I wish you were
also my friend.

01:10:00.033 --> 01:10:01.951
Come in.

01:10:01.993 --> 01:10:02.327
Hey.

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:03.495
Hey.

01:10:03.536 --> 01:10:06.039
Guess what Alex has me doing.

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:09.084
A little last minute
wedding dress redesign.

01:10:09.125 --> 01:10:09.709
Oh.

01:10:13.046 --> 01:10:14.839
Oh, honey.

01:10:14.881 --> 01:10:16.841
I'm sorry.

01:10:16.883 --> 01:10:20.679
I feel like this
is all my fault.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.057
Like I haven't been the
best model of commitment.

01:10:24.099 --> 01:10:27.268
Mom, I'm an adult.
Unfortunately, I can't still

01:10:27.310 --> 01:10:30.605
blame my stuff on you.

01:10:30.647 --> 01:10:32.982
But I also--

01:10:33.024 --> 01:10:36.152
I know I can't live
like this anymore,

01:10:36.194 --> 01:10:38.530
pretending like the
past doesn't exist,

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.782
but also praying that
it doesn't happen again.

01:10:40.824 --> 01:10:42.242
Well, I don't
want that either.

01:10:44.953 --> 01:10:49.874
You know, my wedding, Well,
it was the happiest day

01:10:49.916 --> 01:10:51.418
of my life.

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:57.215
I wore a cap sleeve lace dress
that I designed with my mom.

01:10:57.257 --> 01:11:02.887
Oh, it was hideous by today's
standards, but I loved it.

01:11:02.929 --> 01:11:07.475
And until now when I
thought about my wedding,

01:11:07.517 --> 01:11:11.980
all I could remember was
the pain that followed.

01:11:12.022 --> 01:11:16.568
But now, I remember
how beautiful it was,

01:11:16.609 --> 01:11:22.073
how happy I was,
how good I looked.

01:11:22.115 --> 01:11:24.951
[laughter]

01:11:24.993 --> 01:11:27.954
And I don't want to let the
pain take that away anymore, OK?

01:11:34.377 --> 01:11:37.881
[music playing]

01:11:47.307 --> 01:11:49.309
[non-english singing]

01:11:57.192 --> 01:11:59.778
Mike, hey.

01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:01.780
I needed to tell
you that I'm sorry.

01:12:01.821 --> 01:12:03.782
I know I've been
distant and guarded.

01:12:03.823 --> 01:12:07.410
It's just, this trip has
brought up a lot of issues.

01:12:07.452 --> 01:12:11.623
This trip didn't suddenly
bring up all these issues.

01:12:11.664 --> 01:12:13.708
You've always had them.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.169
You asked why we never
discuss about our wedding

01:12:16.211 --> 01:12:19.798
or where we'd live or
our future together.

01:12:19.839 --> 01:12:23.301
It's because you didn't want to.

01:12:23.343 --> 01:12:25.804
Why didn't you tell me
about your job opportunity

01:12:25.845 --> 01:12:28.098
here on Santorini?

01:12:28.139 --> 01:12:30.809
Maybe it's because you
don't really want it.

01:12:30.850 --> 01:12:32.769
Maybe you don't really want me.

01:12:32.811 --> 01:12:34.312
That's not true.

01:12:34.354 --> 01:12:36.773
It feels like you're
looking for a reason to leave.

01:12:36.815 --> 01:12:38.900
No, because I wasn't ready.

01:12:38.942 --> 01:12:40.819
If you're not
ready for a wedding,

01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.320
how can you be ready
for a marriage?

01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.286
Are you-- are you
breaking up with me?

01:12:50.328 --> 01:12:52.372
I don't know.

01:12:52.414 --> 01:12:56.167
But I'm wondering if this--

01:12:56.209 --> 01:13:01.256
we just don't work.

01:13:01.297 --> 01:13:02.966
[non-english singing]

01:13:22.777 --> 01:13:26.197
Ilana, are you
sure you want to go?

01:13:26.239 --> 01:13:27.907
I think Mike
wants me to go, mom.

01:13:27.949 --> 01:13:30.243
Oh, honey, he didn't say that.

01:13:30.285 --> 01:13:32.495
Yeah, but he said a
lot of other things,

01:13:32.537 --> 01:13:35.915
that I'm not ready and he
doesn't think this can work.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:39.502
And what do you think?

01:13:39.544 --> 01:13:41.421
I want him to be wrong.

01:13:41.463 --> 01:13:44.674
But I think if I'm not ready,
then it's time for me to leave.

01:13:44.716 --> 01:13:46.593
I mean, why have
I been so scared?

01:13:46.634 --> 01:13:48.261
Maybe he is right.

01:13:48.303 --> 01:13:51.097
Maybe instead of being
terrified about being left,

01:13:51.139 --> 01:13:52.891
I should have been more
terrified about being

01:13:52.932 --> 01:13:55.268
the one who leaves.

01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:59.314
I just-- I wish there was
some sort of guarantee.

01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:00.690
Oh, honey.

01:14:00.732 --> 01:14:03.777
No one knows how it's
going to work out,

01:14:03.818 --> 01:14:06.112
at least not until it's passed.

01:14:06.154 --> 01:14:08.698
But you can't live your
life looking backwards,

01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:12.285
not like I did, and not
in your personal life.

01:14:12.327 --> 01:14:14.454
And look, don't you
think by leaving

01:14:14.496 --> 01:14:15.955
it just proves him right?

01:14:15.997 --> 01:14:20.293
Mom, I don't want
to hurt him anymore.

01:14:20.335 --> 01:14:20.877
I know.

01:14:23.713 --> 01:14:25.298
I know I'm late.

01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:29.302
But the church needed me and
then the caterer needed--

01:14:29.344 --> 01:14:30.387
What is this?

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:31.971
This is not what we planned.

01:14:32.013 --> 01:14:34.265
Because I'm not wearing
my hair down anymore.

01:14:34.307 --> 01:14:37.811
Oh, also, I had Susie
alter my dress, made it

01:14:37.852 --> 01:14:39.062
more like the dress I wanted.

01:14:42.065 --> 01:14:43.483
Good.

01:14:43.525 --> 01:14:44.484
It's your wedding.

01:14:44.526 --> 01:14:47.987
You should do what you want to.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:53.660
Alexandra, I know
I can be a little--

01:14:53.702 --> 01:14:57.997
what's the word-- overbearing.

01:14:58.039 --> 01:15:07.007
And I'm sorry because I don't
want to be just your mama.

01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:08.133
I want to be your friend.

01:15:14.639 --> 01:15:16.641
Where is Ilana?

01:15:16.683 --> 01:15:18.977
Ilana's not coming
to the wedding.

01:15:19.019 --> 01:15:20.395
She's going back to Boston.

01:15:20.437 --> 01:15:23.523
She and Mike are taking
space or something.

01:15:23.565 --> 01:15:25.525
Taking space?

01:15:25.567 --> 01:15:26.234
Breaking up?

01:15:33.658 --> 01:15:34.284
I'll be back.

01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:40.915
Yes.

01:16:07.442 --> 01:16:08.735
Please, don't go.

01:16:08.777 --> 01:16:10.945
No, I've caused enough drama.

01:16:10.987 --> 01:16:13.531
Causing drama is not a
reason to leave Greece.

01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:15.909
It's a reason you belong here.

01:16:15.950 --> 01:16:20.038
Anyway, I brought you
a little something.

01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:26.252
It's probably too late, but
Psyche, Eros, and Aphrodite,

01:16:26.294 --> 01:16:29.422
the original monster-in-law.

01:16:29.464 --> 01:16:31.633
I come from a long line.

01:16:31.675 --> 01:16:34.386
Anyway, when I
saw it, I thought,

01:16:34.427 --> 01:16:38.139
what if Aphrodite didn't
set Psyche those tasks

01:16:38.181 --> 01:16:41.101
so she would fail,
what if she said to her

01:16:41.142 --> 01:16:43.978
those tasks so she would learn.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:45.397
What do you mean?

01:16:45.438 --> 01:16:48.066
I mean, maybe I believe
she wanted to teach her

01:16:48.108 --> 01:16:51.945
daughter-in-law how to
persevere, how to say no,

01:16:51.986 --> 01:16:54.239
how to let go of
the things you love,

01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.493
but also how to
keep a hold of them.

01:16:58.535 --> 01:17:03.039
Anyway, I'm going to
meddle one last time,

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:07.293
and then I promise never again.

01:17:07.335 --> 01:17:11.548
You and Mike belong together.

01:17:11.589 --> 01:17:14.426
I know I have made it
very difficult for you,

01:17:14.467 --> 01:17:16.511
and I'm very sorry.

01:17:16.553 --> 01:17:19.097
But I promise, if you
give it another chance,

01:17:19.139 --> 01:17:21.307
I will be on my best behavior.

01:17:21.349 --> 01:17:23.977
But if you want me to be out
of the picture, I will do it.

01:17:24.019 --> 01:17:25.854
No, no, Athena,
I don't want that.

01:17:25.895 --> 01:17:27.355
I don't.

01:17:27.397 --> 01:17:28.982
But I would do it because
I want Mike to be happy,

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.483
and he's happy with you.

01:17:30.525 --> 01:17:32.986
No, he's not happy because
I've really hurt him.

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:34.279
That's happens.

01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:36.114
That's not when you stop loving.

01:17:36.156 --> 01:17:37.532
That's when you
love the hardest.

01:17:41.494 --> 01:17:43.121
How much longer
till the wedding?

01:17:43.163 --> 01:17:44.664
It's supposed to
start in 3 hours.

01:17:44.706 --> 01:17:45.749
So maybe five or six.

01:17:50.128 --> 01:17:51.296
Will you help me?

01:17:56.801 --> 01:17:57.677
Excuse me.

01:17:57.719 --> 01:17:59.012
Where are we going?

01:17:59.054 --> 01:18:00.805
You are following
your mother because she

01:18:00.847 --> 01:18:01.931
knows what is right.

01:18:01.973 --> 01:18:03.975
Which is?

01:18:04.017 --> 01:18:06.311
Look.

01:18:06.353 --> 01:18:07.645
Oh.

01:18:07.687 --> 01:18:09.481
I think maybe you
should go to her.

01:18:09.522 --> 01:18:10.523
I'm just saying.

01:18:10.565 --> 01:18:11.316
I agree.

01:18:26.915 --> 01:18:29.459
What are you doing here?

01:18:29.501 --> 01:18:31.211
I was pulled here.

01:18:31.252 --> 01:18:34.422
Really, I was, because
I could finally

01:18:34.464 --> 01:18:37.342
feel what you were
talking about,

01:18:37.384 --> 01:18:40.553
that guiding
feeling, that knowing

01:18:40.595 --> 01:18:47.310
that something is so right,
that pull to come home to you.

01:18:50.230 --> 01:18:52.899
I'm sorry I messed
everything up.

01:18:52.941 --> 01:18:54.776
It wasn't just this.

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:57.529
Trip was a lot of pressure.

01:18:57.570 --> 01:18:59.155
It was unrealistic.

01:18:59.197 --> 01:19:00.740
And I got scared.

01:19:00.782 --> 01:19:01.533
And I get it.

01:19:01.574 --> 01:19:03.451
I'm scared too.

01:19:03.493 --> 01:19:05.954
But I'm more scared
of losing you.

01:19:05.995 --> 01:19:08.248
Me too.

01:19:08.289 --> 01:19:11.251
And I know that we have
a lot to figure out

01:19:11.292 --> 01:19:14.921
like where we'll be,
how we'll be, your job,

01:19:14.963 --> 01:19:18.258
my job, our families.

01:19:18.299 --> 01:19:21.469
But I really do believe that
we can figure it out together.

01:19:21.511 --> 01:19:24.973
And we can't just
run when it gets hard.

01:19:25.015 --> 01:19:27.058
We have to protect each other.

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:30.520
Yes, always.

01:19:30.562 --> 01:19:37.819
So will you marry me again and
sort of for the first time?

01:19:45.326 --> 01:19:47.787
Oh, speaking of
marriage, we do kind of

01:19:47.829 --> 01:19:49.330
have a wedding to get to.

01:19:49.372 --> 01:19:49.789
Yeah.

01:19:49.831 --> 01:19:50.749
Let's go.

01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:52.500
[non-english singing]

01:20:05.889 --> 01:20:07.891
[non-english speech]

01:20:29.162 --> 01:20:31.706
[non-english singing]

01:21:12.122 --> 01:21:15.625
[applause]

01:21:50.076 --> 01:21:58.626
Mike, you are my light, my pull,
my best friend, and my family.

01:21:58.668 --> 01:22:03.423
Our journey has taken us
across oceans and countries

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:06.676
to get us right to
where we are today--

01:22:06.718 --> 01:22:08.595
together.

01:22:08.636 --> 01:22:11.514
I want you to know that I
am willing to go anywhere

01:22:11.556 --> 01:22:16.019
that our hearts lead us because
as long as we're together,

01:22:16.061 --> 01:22:17.771
I'm home.

01:22:17.812 --> 01:22:21.274
Ilana, ditto.

01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:23.610
You can't ditto
our wedding vows.

01:22:23.651 --> 01:22:25.820
OK, fair enough.

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:31.910
Ilana, when I first met
you, I realized what

01:22:31.951 --> 01:22:34.371
I had been missing in my life.

01:22:34.412 --> 01:22:37.749
I would give you the
world if I could.

01:22:37.791 --> 01:22:44.798
And while maybe I can't give you
that, I can give you my world.

01:22:44.839 --> 01:22:50.136
I can give you my commitments
to our world, wherever

01:22:50.178 --> 01:22:50.845
it takes us.

01:22:54.849 --> 01:22:56.935
[speaking greek]

01:22:56.976 --> 01:22:59.062
I love you too.

01:22:59.104 --> 01:23:02.774
And I'm happy we had this
small simple wedding.

01:23:02.816 --> 01:23:04.859
Well, I think we have
different opinions on what

01:23:04.901 --> 01:23:06.194
simple is.

01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:07.737
I'm so glad I
brought them together.

01:23:14.786 --> 01:23:17.997
[applause]
