07:40.878 --> 07:43.338
‐ You had me
at Jessica Opposites!

07:43.338 --> 07:45.507
[both moaning]

07:45.507 --> 07:49.136
[Jesse moaning]
[rumbling]

07:49.136 --> 07:50.888
‐ Oh look,
the Pupa's a giant or something!

07:50.888 --> 07:52.973
Ugh, I wish I could see
more than just the top of his head.

07:52.973 --> 07:53.807
[Godzilla screeching]

07:53.807 --> 07:56.185
Oh, shit, is that
a fucking Godzilla too?

07:56.185 --> 07:57.978
I wonder if that's the same Godzilla
that came to town

07:57.978 --> 07:59.062
on a book tour last year.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.022
[thudding, rumbling]

08:00.022 --> 08:01.356
Oh my god, did you hear that?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.567
I think the Pupa is in an epic battle
with a Godzilla.

08:03.567 --> 08:06.320
I bet they're stomping on cars
and pushing over skyscrapers and shit.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.112
We could be doing that!

08:07.112 --> 08:09.114
Terry, can we please just go see
what's happening for a minute?

08:09.114 --> 08:10.908
‐ You can go, Korvo,
but you'll lose your spot.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.534
‐ Ugh, I hate not being in line.

08:12.534 --> 08:14.077
Might as well cut my dick off,
you know?

08:14.077 --> 08:15.787
‐ Right?
‐ Ugh, fine. I'll stay.

08:15.787 --> 08:17.331
‐ I'm loving this hat, T‐rex.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.874
‐ Oh, come on, it's nothing
compared to yours.

08:18.874 --> 08:20.709
‐ Well, here's a little trick
of the trade, you dumb bitch.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.753
You gotta get a cap
that covers your neck.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.505
And that also helps collect
your neck sweat.

08:24.505 --> 08:25.756
It's pretty cool, huh?

08:25.756 --> 08:26.882
‐ Oh. Such a good call.

08:26.882 --> 08:29.218
My cap only covers the top of my head
like a total loser.

08:29.218 --> 08:31.970
‐ You're not a loser, Terry.
You're the coolest guy I know.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.889
‐ Yes. You're also
the coolest guy I know.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.557
‐ You told me yesterday
I should die in a fire.

08:35.557 --> 08:36.767
‐ I‐I was joking.
[stomach rumbles]

08:36.767 --> 08:39.269
‐ Oof, all those hot coins
I swallowed for breakfast

08:39.269 --> 08:41.355
are not sitting right.
I gotta go to the bathroom.

08:41.355 --> 08:42.606
‐ Why? We don't have buttholes.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.525
‐ Yeah, I just sit on the seat
and calm down.

08:44.525 --> 08:45.692
Plus it lets me chew my gum.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.320
The way I chew gum is so disgusting
that I can't do it in front of people.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.531
‐ Fine, I'll save your spot
in line while you go.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.658
[both laughing]
Who are we laughing at?

08:52.658 --> 08:54.618
Did I accidentally quote
a TokTik again?

08:54.618 --> 08:58.080
‐ No. It's just, "Save your spot"
is what a line virgin would say.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.706
‐ You're green, so let me explain.

08:59.706 --> 09:02.417
On the professional line circuit,
what Terry needs

09:02.417 --> 09:03.961
is called a "line check."

09:03.961 --> 09:05.504
And if you're cool like me,
you say it

09:05.504 --> 09:06.839
like a quarterback making an audible:

09:06.839 --> 09:09.091
"Line Check! Omaha.
Hut hut, green 8!"

09:09.091 --> 09:11.468
‐ See, I say "line check"
and the other pros will honor it

09:11.468 --> 09:13.428
because we adhere to
an ancient and noble code.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.764
‐ If you don't line check,
you lose your spot,

09:15.764 --> 09:16.974
but worse, your dignity.

09:16.974 --> 09:19.226
‐ Damn, all these arbitrary rules
are hard to keep track of.

09:19.226 --> 09:20.602
‐ Isn't it great?
[yelling] Line check!

09:20.602 --> 09:23.230
‐ Hey, have fun, Tery‐dactyl.

09:24.189 --> 09:26.900
‐ Thanks for the heads up
on that "line check" thing. Oh!

09:26.900 --> 09:28.986
‐ You listen to me,
you worthless little blue bitch.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.946
Terry is mine, this line is mine,

09:30.946 --> 09:32.865
you are a piece of aardvark shit.

09:32.865 --> 09:35.284
‐ Linus, your behavior is completely
different from a moment ago.

09:35.284 --> 09:36.827
Were you bitten
by some kind of spider?

09:36.827 --> 09:38.871
‐ I've stood in hundreds
of lines with Terry,

09:38.871 --> 09:40.706
and I'm not gonna let you slime in here

09:40.706 --> 09:42.082
and ruin what we have.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.792
So fuck all the way off!

09:43.792 --> 09:45.961
‐ Wait, wait,
you're being two‐faced!

09:45.961 --> 09:48.297
I've heard humans do that,
but I've never seen it in real life.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.006
Fascinating.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.632
‐ Leave now or pay the price.

09:50.632 --> 09:53.093
Don't say I didn't warn you,
fuckhead.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.553
Uh‐oh! Speak of the devil.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.096
Welcome back, Terry‐cloth!

09:56.096 --> 09:57.389
‐ Terry! You'll never guess
what happened.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.266
Linus was completely different
when you left.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.393
He was‐‐ he was very mean
and said lots of insults.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.811
‐ But before I left,
he was super nice.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.813
‐ I know!
Linus, show Terry your other face.

10:04.813 --> 10:06.231
Get‐get all mean
and nasty like you did.

10:06.231 --> 10:07.941
‐ Not sure what
you're talking about, Korvo.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.943
I don't think we spoke a word
when Terry was gone.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.904
You stared at the ground
like a real, um,

10:11.904 --> 10:13.113
like, uh, you're so dumb.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.740
‐ Korvo, you don't have
to make stuff up.

10:14.740 --> 10:15.741
‐ Why would I ever do that?

10:15.741 --> 10:18.243
‐ Maybe you're just a little jealous
of my relationship with Linus.

10:18.243 --> 10:21.163
‐ I have a robe and sweet‐ass crystal
that can make me levitate.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.917
I'll never be jealous of some nerd
who jerks off to lines.

10:24.917 --> 10:25.918
‐ You're embarrassing me.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.544
‐ Hey, remember
when we waited in that line

10:27.544 --> 10:30.839
to get into the first‐ever Jimmy Buffett
Buffet and Urgent Care center

10:30.839 --> 10:33.759
and I almost coded out because I ate
all that shrimp that I'm allergic to?

10:33.759 --> 10:35.886
‐ Oh my god,
so many fat fatties!

10:35.886 --> 10:38.430
[both laugh]
[Jesse moaning]

10:42.684 --> 10:44.186
[Yumyulack panting]

10:44.186 --> 10:46.897
‐ [laughs] This line is unstoppable!

10:46.897 --> 10:49.358
Oh shit, a lake? Oh my god,
oh, we're getting in the water?

10:49.358 --> 10:50.609
Ha, that's genius!

10:50.609 --> 10:53.487
We're going so much faster
than those idiots standing on the street!

10:55.364 --> 10:56.615
[panting]

10:58.408 --> 11:00.702
Hell yeah!
Let's steal these bikes! Sick!

11:00.702 --> 11:03.372
[laughing]
[ringing bike bell]

11:03.956 --> 11:05.916
‐ Come on, Korvo,
do squats with us.

11:05.916 --> 11:08.168
We gotta work out our muscles
to keep them from atrophying.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.212
‐ He wouldn't understand.
Look at his tiny legs.

11:10.212 --> 11:12.506
They're like little matchsticks,
except they'll never be lit.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.174
‐ See, that's that two‐faced shit
right there.

11:14.174 --> 11:16.134
‐ It's called word play,
Mr. Sensitive.

11:16.134 --> 11:17.511
[phone buzzing]
‐ Ooh, I gotta take this.

11:17.511 --> 11:19.805
It's my best friend Jeff.
Terry, you would love him.

11:19.805 --> 11:21.682
We met in a wedding line
for the valet.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.601
‐ Okay, what the fuck is the dealio
with you and Linus?

11:24.601 --> 11:26.478
‐ What, Korvo?
He's my line husband.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.106
You know, like how I have Gerard,
my spin class husband,

11:29.106 --> 11:31.525
and Billy Jr.,
my Sunday afternoon Costco husband.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.568
God, why do you care so much?

11:32.568 --> 11:35.237
‐ I don't, okay. It's just,
he touches your waist a lot.

11:35.237 --> 11:37.114
‐ Oh, it's just how we keep
each other steady in line.

11:37.114 --> 11:40.367
‐ Did you see that alien creature
do ancient martial arts on that Godzilla?

11:40.367 --> 11:42.786
‐ I think he's also going to have
to fight that giant robot

11:42.786 --> 11:43.704
that just came into town.

11:43.704 --> 11:46.248
‐ What? Pupa is fighting
a giant lizard and a robot!

11:46.248 --> 11:48.709
That sounds awesome!
I‐I wish I could see better.

11:48.709 --> 11:51.253
Dammit! This is so frustrating.
I can't see the robot.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.672
I bet it does all sorts
of cool stuff like Chappie!

11:55.048 --> 11:56.508
How does this not frustrate you?

11:56.508 --> 11:57.926
‐ I don't know, 'cause I'm smart?

11:57.926 --> 11:59.970
‐ [laughing] Alright, alright, bye‐bye.

11:59.970 --> 12:02.764
Jeff wanted some tips on smoking
a fuckin' rad pork shoulder.

12:02.764 --> 12:05.517
I consider myself
a grill master of sorts.

12:05.517 --> 12:06.685
What'd I miss?
‐ Hold it!

12:06.685 --> 12:07.936
Linus, you can't get back in line.

12:07.936 --> 12:09.646
‐ [mocking] You can't get back in line.

12:09.646 --> 12:11.857
What are you talking about?
I'm the king of this line.

12:11.857 --> 12:12.983
‐ You didn't call line check.
TERRY: Oh!

12:12.983 --> 12:14.860
‐ I didn't "leave,"
I stepped, like, five feet away.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.486
‐ Well, guess what,
that's called leaving.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.155
How do you like
those wordplay apples?

12:18.155 --> 12:20.782
‐ Oh no, I'm sorry,
Linus, but he's right.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.451
Calling line check is just
a part of the rules,

12:22.451 --> 12:24.912
and without rules,
a line is just people standing around.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.830
You know who said that? Gandhi.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.457
I think. Or Kyle Von Titsenburg.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.375
‐ Either way,
you're outtie‐200, Linus.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.127
You might want to find
an easier line to stand in,

12:32.127 --> 12:33.545
maybe at the park
for the baby swings?

12:33.545 --> 12:35.506
‐ You shut your fuckin' mouth!

12:35.506 --> 12:36.590
You're a line loser.

12:36.590 --> 12:39.134
You should never be allowed
to stand next to a pro like me.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.636
‐ There it is!
Th‐th‐there's the other face!

12:40.636 --> 12:42.429
‐ Whoa, he really
does have two faces.

12:42.429 --> 12:43.847
I thought that was just on TV!
‐ Right?

12:43.847 --> 12:46.058
‐ I hope you both get gonorrhea
and go to hell

12:46.058 --> 12:47.559
and there's no line to get in.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.019
‐ Come on, Linus,
don't be like this.

12:49.019 --> 12:50.229
After all the waiting
we've done together?

12:50.229 --> 12:52.189
‐ You know what?
I'm starting a better line.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.316
‐ You can't do that.
That's against all the ancient codes.

12:54.316 --> 12:56.902
‐ Fuck the codes. I'm Linus.

12:56.902 --> 12:58.654
Line is in my name!

12:58.654 --> 13:00.072
‐ Gasp!
‐ Hey, everyone!

13:00.072 --> 13:01.365
WOMAN: Whoa, is that Linus?
‐ Linus!

13:01.365 --> 13:03.408
‐ He won the Standee
three years in a row.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.452
‐ I see a lot of familiar faces in line.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.538
If you're a pro and not a loser

13:07.538 --> 13:09.957
with blue or green skin
and no butthole,

13:09.957 --> 13:12.209
then follow me
to a better way to stand,

13:12.209 --> 13:13.794
right over here.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.754
‐ We better follow.
‐ Linus knows what he's doing.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.922
‐ Nobody fucks with Linus.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.966
‐ But, but... Come on, guys!
The‐the code!

13:22.302 --> 13:24.429
‐ Korvo, you ruined
the greatest line of my lifetime.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.806
‐ It wasn't my fault. Linus‐‐

13:25.806 --> 13:27.432
‐ Ah, I can't even talk
to you right now.

13:27.432 --> 13:28.851
You wanted to share
one of my hobbies with me,

13:28.851 --> 13:30.602
and you literally made it
my nightmare.

13:32.604 --> 13:34.940
‐ Derr!
‐ Ugh, son of a bitch!

13:37.818 --> 13:40.153
‐ Wow, business is exhausting.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.406
‐ Whoa, babe,
you look like a million bucks.

13:42.406 --> 13:44.074
I mean, you look like
you make a million bucks

13:44.074 --> 13:45.117
being a kickass businesswoman.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.536
‐ I am.
The markets went wild today.

13:47.536 --> 13:49.371
You know how it is,
ups and downs.

13:49.371 --> 13:51.665
Stocks and bonds.
Charts and pies.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.625
‐ I made a veal parmesan
without the veal.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.376
Your fave.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.753
Why don't you kick off those heels
and enjoy a nice meal.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.173
‐ This looks amazing.
[bottle shatters]

13:59.173 --> 14:01.758
But the only thing
I want for dinner is

14:01.758 --> 14:05.721
your hair‐mouth
on my mouth‐mouth, mister.

14:05.721 --> 14:08.473
[both moaning]

14:08.473 --> 14:10.767
‐ I cannot believe
after 10 years of marriage,

14:10.767 --> 14:12.144
we still have so much passion.

14:12.144 --> 14:15.522
‐ Now flip me over like you flipped
that not veal parmesan.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.983
Fingerling me like
your potatoes.

14:17.983 --> 14:18.942
Gravy me!

14:18.942 --> 14:21.570
‐ I love it when you mix food and sex.

14:21.570 --> 14:23.363
Just like my hero Ina Garten.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.615
‐ Wait, what are you looking at?

14:27.492 --> 14:30.204
[woman whispers]
[man chuckles]

14:30.204 --> 14:32.623
‐ That hussy!
No one steals my man!

14:33.415 --> 14:36.210
How could you?
After all our years of marriage!

14:36.210 --> 14:39.129
After I work all day
to pay for your sailboat.

14:39.129 --> 14:42.049
‐ Babe, she's just a friend.
‐ I can't believe this.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.552
The one thing we promised each other
was that we would never cheat.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.929
‐ You're being crazy.

14:46.929 --> 14:49.848
‐ He's playing you, ho.
He totally fingers me on the reg.

14:49.848 --> 14:51.767
‐ I knew it!
‐ She's lying. Don't listen to her.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.560
‐ I can't live like this anymore.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.646
We're through.
I want a divorce.

14:57.940 --> 15:00.734
‐ Terry, t‐talk to me.
‐ You ruined a cat five line.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.986
That's like interrupting the path
of a really strong hurricane.

15:02.986 --> 15:05.280
Who would stop an awesome,
powerful hurricane?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.824
‐ Probably Storm the X‐Men,
because she can control the weather

15:07.824 --> 15:09.284
and it would prevent
a lot of property damage.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.119
‐ Now you're rubbing it in my face
that you're smarter than me.

15:11.119 --> 15:13.288
Great. Keep the hits coming.

There are now two
legitimate‐looking lines.

they won't know which line is real.

They are standing pretty excellently.

We got stuck with a bunch of slouchers.

that line for sure.

This is hard for me to say, because
you know I don't like to compliment.
