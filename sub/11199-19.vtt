WEBVTT

00:05.385 --> 00:09.116
<i>The Daedalus. It has a few advantages
over the Prometheus.</i>

00:09.189 --> 00:12.522
The more advanced alien technologies were
integrated into the original design...

00:12.592 --> 00:15.390
- rather than tacked on after the fact.
- When's it going to be ready?

00:15.462 --> 00:19.228
They're testing the Asgard hyperdrive.
Soon as that checks out, she'll be good to go.

00:19.299 --> 00:22.291
Hopefully, we all get to go this time.

00:22.369 --> 00:25.361
Last time they were worried about
spreading our resources too thin.

00:25.439 --> 00:27.907
Yeah, now that Anubis is gone,
the Replicators are gone-

00:27.974 --> 00:29.464
There's still a few system lords...

00:29.543 --> 00:32.535
but without their Jaffa armies,
they've lost most of their power.

00:32.612 --> 00:33.840
Indeed.

00:37.384 --> 00:39.045
Yeah, hold on.

00:39.119 --> 00:40.950
It's for you.

00:41.621 --> 00:43.816
Hello? Yeah. Hi.

00:46.626 --> 00:48.287
What?

00:49.429 --> 00:52.057
No. I was just talking
to her last week.

00:54.301 --> 00:56.701
Yeah, I'll be there.
Thank you.

00:59.740 --> 01:04.507
- What is it?
- Catherine Langford died last night.

02:19.386 --> 02:23.413
Catherine Langford was more
than just kind and generous.

02:23.490 --> 02:26.254
She had a gift...

02:26.326 --> 02:29.193
of an endless, open-minded,
childlike curiosity.

02:30.730 --> 02:32.664
She saw the world
not for what it was...

02:32.732 --> 02:34.666
but for what it could be...

02:34.734 --> 02:39.671
and she saw potential in people
that others failed to recognize.

02:42.075 --> 02:44.043
Like her father before her...

02:44.110 --> 02:48.604
her contributions to science have changed
the world more than most people know.

02:48.682 --> 02:53.449
I, for one, have no idea where
I would be today if I'd never met her.

02:53.520 --> 02:56.887
She changed my life in more ways
than I ever could have imagined.

03:15.609 --> 03:17.839
Dr. Jackson?

03:17.911 --> 03:19.845
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:19.913 --> 03:22.347
I'm Sabrina Gosling.
I'm Catherine's niece.

03:22.415 --> 03:24.349
Yes, of course.

03:24.417 --> 03:27.181
I just wanted to thank you for coming
and for speaking.

03:27.254 --> 03:29.814
I know she would have
really appreciated it.

03:29.890 --> 03:31.824
No, it was an honor.

03:34.461 --> 03:37.089
You know, my aunt used to
talk about you all the time.

03:37.163 --> 03:41.532
It's funny. I always used to picture
some Indiana Jones type...

03:41.601 --> 03:45.162
with a bullwhip and a pistol chasing
bad guys through some ancient temple.

03:45.238 --> 03:47.763
Yeah. I generally
leave the whip at home.

03:47.841 --> 03:50.742
Right. Yeah, me too.

03:54.347 --> 03:56.372
She wanted you
to have this.

04:00.520 --> 04:03.250
No, you're family.
You should keep that.

04:03.323 --> 04:05.917
She thought of you
like a son.

04:14.034 --> 04:15.695
Thank you.

04:17.304 --> 04:19.966
There are a few other odds and ends
she wanted me to give you...

04:20.040 --> 04:22.600
but I wasn't able
to bring them today.

04:22.676 --> 04:24.576
Is there an address
where I could send them?

04:24.644 --> 04:28.239
- Yeah, of course.
- Great.

04:38.892 --> 04:41.053
What's going on?

04:41.127 --> 04:43.618
- You been shopping online lately?
- What you talking about?

04:43.697 --> 04:45.631
You got a little delivery here.

04:45.699 --> 04:48.190
It's from Catherine's estate.

04:48.268 --> 04:51.533
Yeah. Kind of looks like
she sent the whole thing.

04:54.140 --> 04:57.132
Holy... buckets.

04:58.178 --> 05:01.147
Looks like her entire collection.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.609
I prefer stamps.

05:09.689 --> 05:13.352
In addition, we discovered
several grains of troilite...

05:13.426 --> 05:18.796
and a mesostasis phase,
which contained micrometer crystals.

05:20.166 --> 05:21.895
It's undergoing further testing...

05:21.968 --> 05:24.368
but we hope to have the results
first thing tomorrow.

05:24.437 --> 05:27.838
- Don't you keep me waiting.
- No, sir.

05:27.907 --> 05:31.775
Here's where things get
really interesting. You will notice-

05:31.845 --> 05:34.939
Jack, we need to talk.
Sorry for interrupting.

05:35.015 --> 05:39.543
<i>No! It's okay. If it's important,
you must interrupt.</i>

05:39.619 --> 05:42.588
- You must.
- I think we may have found a Z.P.M.

05:42.656 --> 05:44.146
Yes!

05:46.159 --> 05:48.889
Great stuff with the rocks. Go.

05:51.197 --> 05:54.928
Among the items Catherine left me, this
one in particular caught my attention.

05:55.001 --> 05:57.697
<i>It's an original 1889 edition
of The Eye of the Sun.</i>

05:57.771 --> 06:00.137
It's the only one
in known existence.

06:00.206 --> 06:03.369
It details the customs and rituals
observed by the ancient worshippers...

06:03.443 --> 06:05.843
of the sun god Ra.

06:05.912 --> 06:10.645
While I was flipping
through the pages, I noticed this.

06:11.851 --> 06:13.910
It appears to be
a Zero Point Module.

06:13.987 --> 06:16.251
The worshippers of Ra refer to it
as "the heart of light".

06:16.322 --> 06:20.088
This is a reproduction of a wall painting
discovered by archaeologists in 1885.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.323
- It was destroyed in a fire years later.
- The Z.P.M. Was never found?

06:23.396 --> 06:24.488
No.

06:29.569 --> 06:32.231
We did an extensive satellite
sweep of the Giza plateau...

06:32.305 --> 06:34.239
searching for an energy signature...

06:34.307 --> 06:36.867
like the one given off by
the Z.P.M. We found near Taonas.

06:36.943 --> 06:40.538
Even if it's buried under dirt and rock,
we should've been able to detect it.

06:40.613 --> 06:42.103
We found nothing.

06:42.182 --> 06:44.946
I'm sorry, Daniel, but if it's there,
it's probably been depleted.

06:45.018 --> 06:48.715
I don't think so. According to the text,
it was a religious artifact, an icon.

06:48.788 --> 06:50.779
It was never used
as a power source.

06:50.857 --> 06:54.349
It is possible Ra simply took the device
with him when he left Earth.

06:54.427 --> 06:56.452
In which case,
it could be anywhere by now.

06:58.531 --> 07:01.625
We don't know where it is now,
but we do know where it was.

07:03.670 --> 07:06.468
Giza, 3000 B.C.

07:07.874 --> 07:09.808
- You can't be serious.
- What?

07:09.876 --> 07:11.776
- It's the only way.
- What?

07:11.845 --> 07:13.540
No, we agreed.

07:13.613 --> 07:16.411
If I have to say "What?" one more time,
heads are gonna roll.

07:16.483 --> 07:18.246
We have a time machine.
We can get the Z.P.M.

07:18.318 --> 07:21.879
She wouldn't let me go back
and watch the Cubs win the World Series.

07:21.955 --> 07:24.822
This is a unique opportunity.
Ra never knew what he had.

07:24.891 --> 07:27.883
We can go back and take it
without adversely affecting the timeline.

07:27.961 --> 07:32.091
- Actually, he may be right about that.
- You're on board with this?

07:32.165 --> 07:35.191
I'm not happy about it. But we don't
have any historical evidence...

07:35.268 --> 07:37.498
to show that any Goa'uld
has ever used a Z.P.M.

07:37.570 --> 07:40.403
In which case,
it wouldn't be missed.

07:40.473 --> 07:42.498
We would have to be
extremely careful...

07:42.575 --> 07:44.770
to minimize our interaction
with the people of the period.

07:44.844 --> 07:48.575
Yeah, there's that. But I thought you said
you couldn't get it to work.

07:48.648 --> 07:52.277
No one at Area 51 has been able
to engage the time device.

07:52.352 --> 07:54.843
They've barely gotten
the ship off the ground.

07:54.921 --> 07:57.549
But you were able to fly it
without too much difficulty.

07:57.624 --> 08:00.024
Indeed. You have demonstrated
an exceptional ability...

08:00.093 --> 08:02.084
to control Ancient devices.

08:02.162 --> 08:04.995
Jack, think about it.
With a fully functional Z.P.M...

08:05.064 --> 08:08.625
we could power Earth's defenses and
open up a wormhole to the Pegasus galaxy.

08:15.141 --> 08:17.939
Remember, Jack, 3000 B.C.

08:18.011 --> 08:21.811
After Sam hooks up the power,
think about that date and nothing else.

08:21.881 --> 08:26.215
This thing's Ancient.
How's it going to know from B. C?

08:26.286 --> 08:28.447
Your mind is controlling it.

08:28.521 --> 08:31.979
The Ancient computer should be able to
extrapolate from your concept of time.

08:32.058 --> 08:36.518
Shouldn't we test it
on a slightly... smaller leap?

08:36.596 --> 08:38.530
Like, say, to 1908?

08:38.598 --> 08:40.793
Actually, sir, we were able to
determine from the data log...

08:40.867 --> 08:46.134
that the technology only works in time
jumps longer than a couple hundred years.

08:48.942 --> 08:51.911
- I think that's it.
- 3000 B.C.

08:51.978 --> 08:55.505
Any particular day
of the century for you?

09:17.203 --> 09:18.693
What happened?

09:18.771 --> 09:23.265
- I didn't feel anything.
- The time machine pulsed. Try the radio.

09:26.846 --> 09:29.280
Stargate Command,
this is Daniel Jackson. Do you read?

09:31.584 --> 09:34.747
Stargate Command,
this is Daniel Jackson. Come in, please.

09:41.628 --> 09:43.391
The stars are different.

09:43.463 --> 09:46.432
Earth was in a different orbit
around the sun 5,000 years ago.

09:48.635 --> 09:50.262
I think we did it.

10:00.246 --> 10:04.114
I'm finally gonna get proof that the great
pyramids predate the Fourth Dynasty.

10:04.183 --> 10:05.673
What are you going to do?

10:05.752 --> 10:07.982
Stand in the picture holding
a newspaper with today's date?

10:08.054 --> 10:10.887
This is an archaeologist's dream.
I'm going to get as much footage as I can.

10:10.957 --> 10:13.721
Just be careful. We're here
for the Z.P.M. - In and out.

10:13.793 --> 10:15.727
Minimal interaction,
minimal impact.

10:15.795 --> 10:18.423
- No problem.
- I mean it. All of you... sir.

10:20.366 --> 10:23.426
- We got it. We got it.
- And you're gonna need this.

10:23.503 --> 10:26.939
We've determined that
it remotely activates the ship's cloak.

10:28.474 --> 10:30.408
Nice.

11:03.109 --> 11:05.043
My ancient Egyptian's a little rusty...

11:05.111 --> 11:07.306
but I think I got the gist
of what they were saying.

11:07.380 --> 11:11.111
That's Katep
and his brother Salatis.

11:11.184 --> 11:13.175
Hey, guys.

11:13.252 --> 11:16.949
They're on a pilgrimage
to the temple of Ra to make an offering.

11:17.023 --> 11:19.355
- There's timing.
- Tomorrow.

11:19.425 --> 11:22.622
I told them we were from the east.
They offered to put us up for the night.

11:22.695 --> 11:26.688
I was kind of hoping
we wouldn't have to stay that long.

11:26.766 --> 11:30.167
I'm sorry. I keep thinking I'm gonna
step on a bug and change the future.

11:30.236 --> 11:32.796
We can't just walk
into the temple unannounced.

11:32.872 --> 11:35.397
A public audience is
the perfect way to get inside.

11:35.475 --> 11:38.205
We just have to
keep a low profile.

11:40.780 --> 11:44.511
Yes, but more importantly,
did they say what was for dinner?

12:51.451 --> 12:54.079
I don't think he was too
impressed with the offering.

12:57.990 --> 13:01.391
He says he will not tolerate
such disrespect from his followers.

13:06.999 --> 13:08.489
Sir.

13:08.568 --> 13:12.129
Let me do it now.
I won't have to do it in 5,000 years.

13:12.205 --> 13:15.299
You can't do that. There's no telling
what effect it might have.

14:28.648 --> 14:30.582
It's got to be some
sort of treasure room.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.811
If the Z.P.M. Is anywhere,
it'll be in there.

14:55.441 --> 14:59.969
You really think they're gonna let him
just waltz in and take it?

15:01.647 --> 15:04.309
Like I said, they don't even know
what a Z.P.M. Is.

15:04.383 --> 15:07.250
To them, it's like any number
of dozens of ritualistic objects...

15:07.320 --> 15:10.289
they pull out for
any number of occasions.

15:10.356 --> 15:12.290
Besides, he's wearing the shiny suit.

15:16.862 --> 15:18.352
Good luck.

15:39.986 --> 15:41.476
Come on, T.

15:41.554 --> 15:44.785
We would've heard something
if he was in trouble.

16:06.545 --> 16:08.035
Nice.

16:23.162 --> 16:25.926
- Oh, my God.
- We've got a little problem here.

16:25.998 --> 16:28.262
Must have been a sandstorm
during the night.

16:30.202 --> 16:33.194
The Jaffa will call for reinforcements,
if they have not already done so.

16:33.272 --> 16:35.206
We must move quickly.

16:35.274 --> 16:39.540
- Sir, we can't.
- We've taken on more Jaffa than that.

16:39.612 --> 16:41.477
You know what I mean.

16:41.547 --> 16:44.038
This is exactly the sort of high-impact
event we're supposed to avoid.

16:44.116 --> 16:45.879
They have the ship.

16:45.951 --> 16:48.317
Will that not alter the future
more than anything we could do?

16:48.387 --> 16:51.879
Not necessarily.
They don't know what it is.

16:51.957 --> 16:54.016
And even if they did,
they can't use it.

16:54.093 --> 16:57.119
None of them have the gene.
Even Ra won't be able to make it work.

16:57.196 --> 17:00.495
- So what are we supposed to do?
- Nothing.

17:01.734 --> 17:04.567
- Nothing?
- Close to it.

17:04.637 --> 17:08.300
No. Here's a better idea.
We take back our ship.

17:08.374 --> 17:11.172
Sir, we kill those Jaffa
or, worse, get captured...

17:11.243 --> 17:13.905
and we could alter
the future immeasurably.

17:13.979 --> 17:16.709
If you're thinking we can go forward
and then back again-

17:16.782 --> 17:18.716
Just a couple of days.

17:20.186 --> 17:22.677
Then we park that thing
where nobody can find it.

17:22.755 --> 17:25.986
We alter this timeline,
and the future is already different.

17:26.058 --> 17:29.255
We could set into motion
changes that we could never fix.

17:29.328 --> 17:31.262
We've already done too much.

17:31.330 --> 17:34.356
I'm sorry, sir. I should never
have allowed us to do this.

17:45.878 --> 17:48.904
<i>So, what? We live out
the rest of our lives here?</i>

17:48.981 --> 17:51.245
We know there's gonna
be a rebellion eventually.

17:51.317 --> 17:54.150
The human slaves rise up,
and Ra abandons Earth.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.347
Daniel learned that on
Abydos nine years ago.

17:56.422 --> 17:59.323
When it happens, there is a chance
that we could get the Jumper back...

17:59.392 --> 18:02.293
without creating too big a ripple
in the events of this timeline.

18:03.295 --> 18:04.887
When does that happen?

18:04.964 --> 18:07.023
I don't know the exact date.
It could be years.

18:07.099 --> 18:10.728
- What? Years?
- Sir, we don't have a choice.

18:12.037 --> 18:15.097
Carter, what about the Z.P. M?

18:15.174 --> 18:20.237
If we wait, we lose any chance
of getting it back to our time.

18:20.312 --> 18:22.872
Preserving the timeline
is more important.

18:24.016 --> 18:26.780
For all you know,
things could get better.

18:26.852 --> 18:30.913
Or they could be worse.
We can't take that chance.

18:30.990 --> 18:34.289
I know a way we can get the Z.P.M.
Back to our time, even if we don't.

18:34.360 --> 18:36.794
A month before I left, there
was an archeological dig...

18:36.862 --> 18:38.625
that uncovered
a First Dynasty tomb near Giza.

18:38.697 --> 18:41.427
All we have to do is bury the Z.P.M.
In that tomb, let them find it...

18:41.500 --> 18:45.027
and maybe our future selves
won't have to take on this mission.

18:45.104 --> 18:47.299
That's bizarre,
but it might just work.

18:47.373 --> 18:53.141
Carter, a lot of good people
died when Anubis attacked Earth.

18:53.212 --> 18:56.909
I don't think their families would mind
if we futzed with the timeline a little.

18:56.982 --> 18:59.143
Sir, I know this is hard for you.

18:59.218 --> 19:01.618
Your instinct is to change things,
make things better...

19:01.687 --> 19:03.917
but, for once, that's exactly
what we can't do.

19:03.989 --> 19:07.117
We have to let things play out
exactly the way they're meant to.

19:10.529 --> 19:14.488
English is a complex language...

19:14.567 --> 19:17.536
a hybrid of many different influences...

19:17.603 --> 19:19.696
much like the culture it represents.

19:19.772 --> 19:23.765
To understand it is to gain
an insight into that culture...

19:23.843 --> 19:27.210
and the process of integration
that created it.

19:31.217 --> 19:34.948
Let's start
with a simple greeting.

19:35.020 --> 19:39.320
Often the best way to begin interacting
with someone is to find a common interest.

19:40.960 --> 19:44.487
Everyone can relate to the weather
so let's start with that, shall we?

19:45.698 --> 19:48.792
Introduce yourself and
talk about the weather.

19:51.704 --> 19:52.671
Yes?

19:56.809 --> 19:59.710
Hello. My name is Carlos.
You make me so hot.

20:02.214 --> 20:03.704
Okay.

20:06.418 --> 20:09.512
Not quite right, but
the introduction part was good.

20:10.589 --> 20:12.557
Daniel, sorry to bother you...

20:12.625 --> 20:14.559
but there are some
people here to see you.

20:14.627 --> 20:18.495
Excuse me for just one second.

20:18.564 --> 20:22.000
- What kind of people?
- Air force people.

20:33.779 --> 20:38.739
This is totally unbelievable!
You are a small and pathetic man.

20:38.817 --> 20:41.251
Those were my theories
on spin wave technology...

20:41.320 --> 20:44.448
and the effects of antigravity
on electromagnetism, and you know it!

20:47.192 --> 20:51.822
Just because my reproductive organs
are on the inside instead of the outside-

20:51.897 --> 20:55.025
God, that's horrible.
Who would ever say that?

21:00.139 --> 21:02.437
- Who are you talking to?
- No one.

21:02.508 --> 21:05.966
- Were you talking to yourself?
- No.

21:06.045 --> 21:09.071
Have you proofread my review
of the solid fuel rockets yet?

21:10.683 --> 21:13.618
I'm almost done. Good job.

21:13.686 --> 21:16.086
Thank you.

21:16.155 --> 21:19.283
Keep up the good work, Carter.
You'll be moving up around here.

21:20.726 --> 21:22.819
Excuse me.

21:24.330 --> 21:26.093
Major Davis, United States Air Force.

21:26.165 --> 21:28.133
Dr. Hirschfield.

21:28.200 --> 21:30.293
I know who you are.

21:30.369 --> 21:32.564
What's this all about?

21:32.638 --> 21:34.572
It's a matter of national security.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.507
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty
to discuss that here.

21:37.576 --> 21:40.807
Of course. By all means.

21:40.879 --> 21:42.813
We can talk privately in my office.

21:42.881 --> 21:45.748
Oh, no. I'm not here to talk to you.

21:47.353 --> 21:49.583
I'd like to speak to Dr. Carter.

21:56.228 --> 21:57.786
Me?

22:08.107 --> 22:09.699
Colonel O'Neill.

22:09.775 --> 22:14.940
Samuels. You and the boys
looking to charter a boat for the day?

22:15.014 --> 22:18.711
No, sir. I've been sent by the Pentagon
to escort you back to Washington.

22:18.784 --> 22:21.309
I could give a rat's butt.

22:23.222 --> 22:25.452
It's a matter of
national security, sir.

22:25.524 --> 22:27.458
Find someone else.

22:27.526 --> 22:31.155
We can't. It has to be you.

22:31.230 --> 22:35.189
If you'll allow me,
I'll try and explain it on the way.

22:37.069 --> 22:39.003
Sammy, it just doesn't
sound like fun.

22:43.275 --> 22:45.300
Oh, God.

23:14.473 --> 23:18.773
If you'll just wait here, ma'am, General
Hammond will be with you in a moment.

23:24.583 --> 23:26.517
Hi.

23:26.585 --> 23:29.019
Hi.

23:29.088 --> 23:31.852
- Dr. Daniel Jackson.
- Dr. Samantha Carter.

23:31.924 --> 23:34.085
- Oh, PhD.
- Me too.

23:34.159 --> 23:35.558
- Astrophysics.
- Egyptology.

23:35.627 --> 23:37.390
You wouldn't know why we're here?

23:39.465 --> 23:42.059
5,000 years ago, maybe, but now? No.

23:42.134 --> 23:44.694
- I was kind of hoping you did.
- Sorry.

23:51.844 --> 23:54.745
- I teach English as a Second Language.
- Department of Aerospace.

23:55.347 --> 23:58.248
Not as an astronaut.

23:58.317 --> 24:02.777
No. I check other
people's scientific reports...

24:02.855 --> 24:06.586
for factual errors or omissions
before they get sent up to the director.

24:08.060 --> 24:10.756
That's... interesting.

24:10.829 --> 24:12.990
Yeah. Not really.

24:13.065 --> 24:17.798
Dr. Jackson, Dr. Carter.
I'm General George Hammond. Please.

24:33.218 --> 24:36.187
- What's this?
- Nondisclosure agreement.

24:36.255 --> 24:37.950
What we're about to discuss...

24:38.023 --> 24:40.924
has been classified top secret
by the United States government.

24:40.993 --> 24:43.461
What if we don't want to sign it?

24:43.529 --> 24:45.997
Then you're free to leave.

25:07.186 --> 25:10.019
You have a background in archaeology,
isn't that right, Dr. Jackson?

25:10.088 --> 25:12.022
That's right.

25:12.090 --> 25:16.220
But your theories failed to gain
much acceptance among your colleagues.

25:16.295 --> 25:19.128
You could say that.

25:19.198 --> 25:23.498
Egyptian pyramids as
landing pads for alien spacecraft.

25:23.569 --> 25:26.231
I did not say that unequivocally.

25:26.305 --> 25:29.001
I simply put forth the possibility that,
based on the knowledge-

25:29.074 --> 25:32.703
That's all right, Doctor. You don't
have to defend your theories here.

25:32.778 --> 25:37.613
A month ago, a team of archaeologists
from the University of Chicago...

25:37.683 --> 25:41.244
uncovered an ancient
Egyptian tomb near Giza.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.347
Inside, they found artifacts
typical of the period...

25:45.424 --> 25:50.225
plus one or two objects that have
yet to be identified, and a video camera.

25:50.295 --> 25:52.855
A video camera?

25:52.931 --> 25:57.800
It was perfectly preserved
in a vacuum-sealed canopic jar.

25:57.870 --> 26:01.772
The technology is somewhat different to
what is commercially available today...

26:01.840 --> 26:04.331
but we managed to
charge the battery.

26:04.409 --> 26:08.004
However, we didn't bring you here
because we found a camera.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.877
We brought you here...

26:09.948 --> 26:13.247
because of what had been recorded
on the tape inside that camera.

26:14.386 --> 26:16.445
<i>Okay, I think it's ready.</i>

26:18.824 --> 26:24.057
<i>Okay. My name is Dr. Daniel Jackson.
I'm part of a team called SG-1.</i>

26:24.129 --> 26:26.962
<i>We have just traveled
back in time 5,000 years.</i>

26:38.710 --> 26:41.406
<i>See, the thing is, we're not sure
we're gonna make it back.</i>

26:41.480 --> 26:44.347
<i>The chamber where you
discover this tape...</i>

26:44.416 --> 26:46.475
<i>should be discovered shortly
before we're set to leave.</i>

26:46.551 --> 26:49.019
<i>Hopefully, the timeline
hasn't changed at all.</i>

26:49.087 --> 26:51.715
<i>Let's see, what are
some recent major events?</i>

26:51.790 --> 26:54.418
<i>Communism recently failed
in Eastern Europe.</i>

26:54.493 --> 26:57.553
<i>They should be well on their way
towards democracy by now.</i>

26:57.629 --> 26:59.563
<i>Henry Hayes is President.
What else?</i>

26:59.631 --> 27:03.123
- Henry Hayes?
- Secretary of the Interior.

27:03.201 --> 27:07.069
President Kinsey was less than amused
when he saw that portion of the tape.

27:08.140 --> 27:10.074
<i>Sam, help me out here.</i>

27:10.142 --> 27:12.440
<i>Samantha Carter, Lieutenant Colonel
in the United States Air Force...</i>

27:12.511 --> 27:14.001
<i>and a member of SG-1.</i>

27:14.079 --> 27:16.946
<i>Right, I suppose we should tell them
about the Stargate.</i>

27:17.015 --> 27:18.949
- Oh, my God.
- What's SG-1?

27:19.017 --> 27:20.245
Watch.

27:20.319 --> 27:22.787
<i>Colonel Carter and I
work for Stargate Command.</i>

27:22.854 --> 27:24.947
<i>It is located under Cheyenne Mountain.</i>

27:25.023 --> 27:27.491
<i>For the past eight years,
we've been regularly traveling...</i>

27:27.559 --> 27:31.290
<i>through a large ring-shaped
device known as the Stargate.</i>

27:31.363 --> 27:34.526
<i>It should have been discovered in 1928,
somewhere near where this tape was found.</i>

27:34.599 --> 27:37.329
<i>By means of these off-world missions...</i>

27:37.402 --> 27:40.030
<i>we've managed to acquire
a lot of advanced technology...</i>

27:40.105 --> 27:43.040
<i>which has helped us defend Earth
against several alien attacks.</i>

27:43.108 --> 27:46.703
<i>Lf, for whatever reason, the things
we're talking about are not true...</i>

27:46.778 --> 27:49.770
<i>then it is possible that we have somehow
inadvertently changed the future.</i>

27:49.848 --> 27:52.408
<i>The purpose of this tape is to provide you
with the tools you will need...</i>

27:52.484 --> 27:55.146
<i>to go back in time
and set things right.</i>

27:55.220 --> 27:58.018
<i>Lf, for whatever reason, the Stargate
has not been discovered...</i>

27:58.090 --> 28:00.558
<i>you will have to find it
and get it up and running.</i>

28:02.627 --> 28:04.561
<i>Jack, you should say something.</i>

28:04.629 --> 28:06.563
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

28:06.631 --> 28:08.565
<i>We should all appear on the tape.</i>

28:08.633 --> 28:11.864
<i>We have no way ofknowing
how things could've changed.</i>

28:17.843 --> 28:20.573
<i>General Jack O'Neill...</i>

28:20.645 --> 28:23.443
<i>United States Air Force.
How you doin'?</i>

28:24.950 --> 28:27.783
<i>Tell them about the future.</i>

28:31.757 --> 28:34.920
<i>College football is played on Saturdays,
pro on Sundays...</i>

28:34.993 --> 28:38.326
<i>and there are no fish in my pond...</i>

28:38.397 --> 28:40.991
<i>at all... where I fish.</i>

28:42.868 --> 28:45.063
<i>I think that covers it.</i>

28:50.776 --> 28:52.710
Did he say Stargate?

28:52.778 --> 28:54.405
Time travel?

28:55.480 --> 28:57.448
What else did the tape say?

28:57.516 --> 29:02.044
Details of the Stargate, SG-1...

29:02.120 --> 29:07.387
including a fourth member, who appears
to be some kind of humanoid alien.

29:07.459 --> 29:10.895
Are you telling us that...

29:10.962 --> 29:15.365
in some alternate timeline,
we're part of a team that...

29:15.434 --> 29:20.201
travels to other planets and defends Earth
against alien invasions?

29:20.272 --> 29:21.762
I know.

29:23.041 --> 29:24.975
It seems difficult to believe.

29:26.378 --> 29:29.313
What about this Stargate?
Did you look for it?

29:29.381 --> 29:32.817
We searched the coordinates provided
on the tape, but we didn't find anything.

29:32.884 --> 29:38.516
The area had already been excavated
previously in 1934, by a Dr. Langford...

29:39.558 --> 29:41.492
but he found nothing but a tablet...

29:41.560 --> 29:45.826
inscribed with hieroglyphics that no one
has ever been able to translate.

29:45.897 --> 29:48.161
We were wondering if you'd
like to take a crack at it.

29:48.233 --> 29:50.326
Are you kidding?

29:55.707 --> 29:57.834
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:00.278 --> 30:04.408
So... what do you think of all this?

30:05.951 --> 30:08.419
To be honest, I don't know what to think.
It's pretty overwhelming.

30:08.487 --> 30:11.684
- Yeah.
- Time travel is theoretically possible.

30:11.756 --> 30:14.486
There's been a lot of research
into the area of quantum gravity...

30:14.559 --> 30:18.495
which suggests that time flows
like rotating fluid within our galaxy...

30:18.563 --> 30:22.124
technically allowing the traveler
to journey backward and forward at will...

30:22.200 --> 30:25.533
but there's a huge amount
of energy required.

30:25.604 --> 30:27.538
Actually, I was talking about us.

30:27.606 --> 30:32.305
The other us. I guess we could call it
the us we're supposed to be.

30:34.446 --> 30:36.607
Didn't you think you were destined
for something more?

30:36.681 --> 30:40.481
I mean, something a hell of a lot more
fulfilling than a nine-to-five desk job?

30:40.552 --> 30:42.315
I suppose.

30:42.387 --> 30:46.323
I don't know. I just always felt
like my life was wrong.

30:46.391 --> 30:50.657
Life is what you make it,
you know, for better or worse.

30:50.729 --> 30:54.392
Look at this
as a way to change everything.

30:54.466 --> 30:57.230
If we help them find this Stargate-

30:58.803 --> 31:02.000
What do you think
they're gonna do?

31:02.073 --> 31:05.975
Ask us to join an elite team
of intergalactic space heroes?

31:06.044 --> 31:08.512
Look at us.

31:08.580 --> 31:12.141
The only reason that they
showed us the tape is because we're on it.

31:12.217 --> 31:13.809
Exactly.

31:18.757 --> 31:22.215
<i>Okay. That about covers the gate
dialing system, the point of origin...</i>

31:22.294 --> 31:24.228
<i>the address to Chulak,
and the home address.</i>

31:24.296 --> 31:28.630
<i>What else? Oh, right.</i>

31:29.634 --> 31:33.400
<i>Okay. Now, this is very important.</i>

31:33.471 --> 31:35.632
<i>- It's called a Z.P.M. -Zero-
- Daniel Jackson.</i>

31:35.707 --> 31:38.141
<i>- What?
- The battery is about to expire.</i>

31:38.210 --> 31:40.144
<i>This is very important.</i>

31:40.212 --> 31:42.180
<i>This is called a zero-point module.
Its purpose is-</i>

31:43.315 --> 31:46.409
How's that for timing?

31:46.484 --> 31:50.113
This Z.P.M. Was recovered
along with the tape?

31:50.188 --> 31:52.918
Yes. We have a team of scientists
studying it as we speak.

31:55.493 --> 31:59.122
- How's the translation coming?
- Gee.

31:59.197 --> 32:02.928
It's an obscure dialect.
I can see why your experts had trouble.

32:04.336 --> 32:06.270
But?

32:06.338 --> 32:09.774
But it's almost as if the person
who chiseled this tablet knew my research.

32:11.810 --> 32:16.577
In 2995 B.C., about five years after the
team on this tape arrived in the past...

32:16.648 --> 32:18.582
there was an uprising.

32:18.650 --> 32:22.381
The ancient Egyptians rebelled
against the sun god Ra...

32:22.454 --> 32:24.422
or someone who
they believed to be an impostor.

32:24.489 --> 32:26.548
Apparently, whoever this impostor was...

32:26.625 --> 32:30.152
he left in a great flying ship
and took the Stargate with him.

32:30.228 --> 32:31.490
That is unfortunate.

32:31.563 --> 32:33.793
Yeah, but the tablet makes
reference to a location...

32:33.865 --> 32:35.799
where there might be a second
Stargate on Earth.

32:35.867 --> 32:36.891
Where?

32:38.436 --> 32:40.404
I'm still working on that.

32:40.472 --> 32:44.101
Thank you, Doctor.
I look forward to your report.

32:44.175 --> 32:47.076
General...

32:47.145 --> 32:50.979
if it's all right, I'd like to join
the expedition to find this second gate.

32:58.390 --> 33:01.518
You were right.
They're gonna shut us out.

33:01.593 --> 33:03.527
Can't say I'm surprised.

33:03.595 --> 33:06.689
I haven't finished the entire translation
yet. We still have some leverage.

33:07.832 --> 33:09.766
What else does it say?

33:11.369 --> 33:14.896
It says the second Stargate
is somewhere in Antarctica.

33:15.907 --> 33:18.432
Somewhere in Antarctica?

33:18.510 --> 33:21.638
It doesn't even say that. It says
"the land of the cold to the south,"

33:21.713 --> 33:23.704
which I'm guessing
means Antarctica.

33:23.782 --> 33:26.478
It's a big place. Lots of ice.

33:26.551 --> 33:28.610
Yeah. Whoever wrote the tablet
didn't have a way...

33:28.687 --> 33:31.815
of explaining latitude and longitude
in ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs.

33:31.890 --> 33:35.553
At least you're still useful. I don't
know why they're keeping me around.

33:35.627 --> 33:38.721
I'm not going to let them shut you out
either. We're supposed to be a team.

33:40.065 --> 33:42.397
We have to stick together.

33:43.068 --> 33:44.865
That's nice. Really.

33:46.438 --> 33:47.928
Yeah.

33:49.507 --> 33:52.067
We need someone who's
willing to go to bat for us...

33:52.143 --> 33:55.135
someone they can't say no to.

34:16.735 --> 34:18.669
You folks looking for
a little tour?

34:21.039 --> 34:22.529
Yeah.

34:24.142 --> 34:27.737
I'm Daniel Jackson.
This is Samantha Carter.

34:33.151 --> 34:35.085
You two a couple?

34:35.153 --> 34:37.713
No! We just met.

34:37.789 --> 34:39.689
What do you want?

34:45.163 --> 34:47.131
We were recently
approached by the military...

34:47.198 --> 34:52.966
about a matter of...
of national security.

34:53.037 --> 34:54.937
Don't care.

34:55.006 --> 34:58.772
This is really important. All we're asking
is a little bit of your time.

35:03.114 --> 35:05.446
150 bucks an hour
to rent the boat.

35:05.517 --> 35:09.977
- We don't want to go anywhere.
- It's your money.

35:11.256 --> 35:13.588
Ultimately, what we have to do is this.

35:13.658 --> 35:17.219
We have to find the Stargate, and then
get hold of this time travel device.

35:17.295 --> 35:19.229
Locate this alien named Teal'c.

35:19.297 --> 35:23.734
Right. Get Teal'c, then go back in time
to change the past to fix the future.

35:28.573 --> 35:32.236
- Are you listening?
- I was trying not to.

35:34.379 --> 35:36.609
Yeah, I suppose it does
sound a little crazy.

35:36.681 --> 35:39.172
Really? Which part?

35:42.720 --> 35:45.848
I'd have to say the moment
I let you on board.

35:45.924 --> 35:48.324
You don't have to believe us.

35:48.393 --> 35:51.590
All we ask is that you watch the tape
and decide for yourself.

35:51.663 --> 35:54.791
You know, I have decided and-
Hey, look, your time's up!

35:54.866 --> 35:58.802
Aren't you the least bit intrigued that
there might be something else out there?

36:01.072 --> 36:03.506
Something more than... this?

36:09.781 --> 36:11.271
No.

36:12.884 --> 36:15.444
We're supposed to be a team.
We save the world.

36:15.520 --> 36:17.010
Several times.

36:17.088 --> 36:20.683
Yeah. Okay. Sure.

36:20.758 --> 36:22.555
I'll buy that.

36:24.195 --> 36:28.564
The three of us-The world, we save it.
Great. Okay.

36:28.633 --> 36:32.569
I can't believe I wasted
my frequent-flier miles on this.

36:34.372 --> 36:38.001
- Sorry to bother you.
- Not a problem.

37:03.468 --> 37:05.436
No worries, eh?

37:17.515 --> 37:19.449
Do you have any idea
what's going on?

37:23.721 --> 37:26.053
- Major, what's this about?
- Did you find the second Stargate?

37:26.124 --> 37:29.025
No, we didn't, but we decided
to show you something else.

37:29.093 --> 37:31.027
Airman.

37:39.804 --> 37:43.604
We think this was the ship SG-1
used to travel back in time.

37:53.117 --> 37:55.051
Where'd you find it?

37:55.119 --> 37:57.553
It was uncovered during
an excavation of the area...

37:57.622 --> 37:59.556
around the tomb
where the tape was found.

37:59.624 --> 38:01.114
Please.

38:11.269 --> 38:14.830
This is incredible.
Is it operational?

38:14.906 --> 38:16.396
Not yet.

38:24.215 --> 38:27.446
According to the tape,
Jack O'Neill has a special gene...

38:27.518 --> 38:29.509
that makes him
able to fly this thing.

38:30.989 --> 38:33.253
These are constellations.

38:33.324 --> 38:37.021
Right, the tape said that this was
able to go through the Stargate...

38:37.095 --> 38:39.029
as well as time travel.

38:39.097 --> 38:41.861
So this must be
what dials the gate.

38:41.933 --> 38:44.800
Don't touch anything!

38:44.869 --> 38:48.361
Please, leave the touching
to the experts.

38:48.439 --> 38:51.875
Dr. Rodney McKay is the lead
scientist on the project.

38:51.943 --> 38:53.433
Hi.

38:54.879 --> 38:56.813
Pleased to meet you.

38:57.849 --> 39:01.182
We were hoping they may be
of assistance to you.

39:02.854 --> 39:05.846
Yes. Thank you.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.551
I'll leave you to it, then.

39:13.631 --> 39:17.863
Did you try dialing the Stargate address
that the Jackson on the tape mentions?

39:17.935 --> 39:19.869
No. Why would we do that?

39:19.937 --> 39:24.033
- Just to see if-
- Of course we tried.

39:24.108 --> 39:27.339
It's called sarcasm. We tried the address
numerous times. Nothing happened.

39:27.412 --> 39:29.539
Did you try any other combinations?

39:29.614 --> 39:33.345
I'm sorry. What are
your areas of expertise?

39:33.418 --> 39:35.909
- Astrophysics.
- Archaeology.

39:35.987 --> 39:37.852
And I would listen to you because-

39:38.990 --> 39:41.652
We're on the tape.

39:41.726 --> 39:44.217
No, you, I would listen to
if you were reading the phone book.

39:44.295 --> 39:49.494
- Oh, brother.
- I love this whole sexy librarian thing.

39:49.567 --> 39:52.195
Look, why don't I take you to lunch,
get you up to speed?

39:52.270 --> 39:54.966
I hear it's lemon chicken today,
my favorite.

39:56.240 --> 39:58.504
A lot to talk about.

40:05.183 --> 40:07.014
Is he behind me?

40:07.085 --> 40:08.575
- Who?
- McKay.

40:11.255 --> 40:14.247
Thank God. I think I lost him.
The guy is driving me nuts.

40:14.325 --> 40:17.021
Any progress with the ship?

40:17.095 --> 40:20.587
The technology is way beyond us,
but I do have something.

40:20.665 --> 40:23.031
- It could be big.
- What?

40:23.101 --> 40:26.161
Remember how McKay said they tried
dialing the Stargate address several times...

40:26.237 --> 40:28.171
and nothing happened?

40:28.239 --> 40:30.833
- Yeah.
- I started thinking.

40:30.908 --> 40:32.773
<i>Nothing happened here.</i>

40:35.813 --> 40:37.747
What have you got?

40:37.815 --> 40:40.147
We're waiting
to see General Hammond.

40:41.152 --> 40:43.586
He's busy.
Why don't you tell me?

40:43.654 --> 40:45.645
I'll decide if
it's worth interrupting him.

40:55.333 --> 40:58.097
I cross-referenced our previous
attempts to dial the gate...

40:58.169 --> 41:00.399
with some recent seismic
activity in Antarctica.

41:00.471 --> 41:02.405
They're a perfect match.

41:02.473 --> 41:06.170
The epicenter in all eight cases
was exactly the same-

41:06.244 --> 41:09.236
approximately 50 miles
outside of McMurdo.

41:09.313 --> 41:10.974
That...

41:11.048 --> 41:14.245
is where you'll
find your second gate.

41:14.318 --> 41:16.183
Worth it?

41:18.389 --> 41:19.879
Excuse me.

41:39.477 --> 41:41.570
General, you wanted to see us?

41:45.716 --> 41:49.948
It was exactly where you said
it would be. Good work.

41:50.021 --> 41:51.511
Thank you, sir.

41:53.291 --> 41:57.227
I want you both to know that your help
on this project was most appreciated.

41:57.295 --> 41:59.286
Your country owes you
a debt of gratitude.

42:01.632 --> 42:03.566
But we're not done yet.

42:03.634 --> 42:06.660
Actually, we're not done.

42:06.737 --> 42:10.503
You two, however, have a plane
waiting to take you home.

42:10.575 --> 42:13.908
I'm sure I don't need to remind you of the
details of the nondisclosure agreement.

42:13.978 --> 42:18.847
Wait a minute. You are going to send
a team through the gate, aren't you?

42:18.916 --> 42:21.680
- We're assembling a team as we speak.
- But you saw the tape.

42:21.752 --> 42:25.313
We are that team. I mean, if anybody
should be going, it's us.

42:25.389 --> 42:28.881
I'm sorry, Dr. Jackson,
but neither you nor Dr. Carter...

42:28.960 --> 42:32.088
possess the training or qualifications
for a mission like this.

42:32.163 --> 42:34.188
That's just the way it is.
