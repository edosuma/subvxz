WEBVTT

00:15.000 --> 00:18.137
- There's Maureen Dowd.
And Colson Whitehead!

00:18.206 --> 00:20.862
I've never been to one of these
National Arts Club parties.

00:20.931 --> 00:22.241
Draws an impressive crowd.

00:22.310 --> 00:23.586
- As long as you have
an open bar,

00:23.655 --> 00:26.000
you'll attract
every writer in town.

00:26.068 --> 00:28.034
Speaking of.
Michael.

00:28.103 --> 00:31.172
- Charles, nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

00:31.241 --> 00:35.103
Um, let me give you this.

00:35.172 --> 00:37.413
- Oh, Mercury.
Feisty move,

00:37.482 --> 00:38.862
competing with
your own company.

00:38.931 --> 00:41.310
- Feisty isn't the F word
I would choose.

00:41.379 --> 00:42.862
- Michael Cunningham,
Liza Miller.

00:42.931 --> 00:47.275
My, uh--girlfriend.
- And editor at Millennial.

00:47.344 --> 00:49.827
- Competition is good
for business.

00:49.896 --> 00:51.241
It keeps us on our toes

00:51.310 --> 00:53.379
and keeps you, the writer,
at the center.

00:53.448 --> 00:55.482
We should lock in a meeting.
- We should.

00:55.551 --> 00:57.275
Have a lovely evening.
- Bye.

00:57.344 --> 00:59.000
- Wow, lock in a meeting.

01:00.827 --> 01:03.689
You will never steal him away
from Macmillan, but nice try.

01:03.758 --> 01:06.137
- You're enjoying this.
- Maybe I am.

01:06.206 --> 01:10.137
What choice do I have?
Be mad at you or be better.

01:10.206 --> 01:12.000
- Ah.

01:13.482 --> 01:14.931
A couple of A-listers
in this club.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.448
- Lucky I brought
my A-game then.

01:19.275 --> 01:21.068
- Let the games begin.

01:21.137 --> 01:22.758
- Oh!

01:30.172 --> 01:32.275
Locked one in for me.

01:38.827 --> 01:40.275
- Feeling locked out?

01:49.551 --> 01:53.206
Oh, Meg Wolitzer,
Charles Brooks.

01:53.275 --> 01:54.517
- Hi, Megan.

01:54.586 --> 01:56.000
- Charles, it is great
to see you.

01:56.068 --> 01:59.137
Congrats on everything.
Mercury is killing it.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.551
- Thank you, Meg.
We're enjoying

02:00.620 --> 02:02.482
being the new kids
on the block.

02:02.551 --> 02:04.724
- Very new.
When did you get these printed?

02:04.793 --> 02:06.758
Yesterday?
Have you printed any books yet?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.344
- Uh, you want to
get a picture?

02:08.413 --> 02:10.241
- Sure.

02:10.310 --> 02:12.827
Caption that, "New York Times
best-selling author

02:12.896 --> 02:14.586
"Meg Wolitzer,
Millennial editor,

02:14.655 --> 02:16.034
Liza Miller, and guest."

02:16.103 --> 02:18.448
- We'd--we'd love
to lock in a meeting.

02:18.517 --> 02:20.620
- We've already
locked in lunch.

02:20.689 --> 02:23.344
- Hi, would you excuse me?
- Of course.

02:23.413 --> 02:25.310
- Just pretend
you're talking to me.

02:27.241 --> 02:28.827
- Oh, from Zane.

02:28.896 --> 02:31.586
Mercury is featured
in "New York Mag"'s

02:31.655 --> 02:35.068
Approval Matrix
as high-brow/brilliant.

02:35.137 --> 02:37.000
Millennial is on there, too.

02:37.068 --> 02:38.793
- We are?
As what?

02:38.862 --> 02:41.000
- I'm low-brow!
Because of all the authors

02:41.068 --> 02:43.034
leaving Millennial,
I am at the bottom

02:43.103 --> 02:45.413
of the four quadrants.
- Don't read into it.

02:45.482 --> 02:47.758
It's just a pop culture
hot or not list.

02:47.827 --> 02:50.655
- Charles is hot and I'm not?

02:50.724 --> 02:52.172
- Well, it is
a good picture of him.

02:52.241 --> 02:54.827
No one reads this thing.
- Did you see this, Kelsey?

02:54.896 --> 02:56.724
Your decapitated head
is hovering between

02:56.793 --> 02:58.241
low-brow and despicable
right next to

02:58.310 --> 03:00.689
Disney live action remakes
and nude restaurants.

03:00.758 --> 03:02.517
- Yeah, I saw it, Diana.
- And how unflattering.

03:02.586 --> 03:04.172
Crop you right at your chin.

03:04.241 --> 03:06.620
A head without a neck is like
a kite without a string.

03:06.689 --> 03:07.793
Just a floating tragedy.

03:07.862 --> 03:09.586
- Let's focus on
these two heads.

03:09.655 --> 03:11.758
- Hayley and Cameron Butler.
I love them.

03:11.827 --> 03:13.517
- Everybody does.
"New York Flip"

03:13.586 --> 03:16.482
is HGTV's highest-rated
reno show.

03:16.551 --> 03:18.275
They have built
an empire from it.

03:18.344 --> 03:21.000
Furniture line, home décor,
even signature fragrances.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.827
- Enzo wears their
Bhutan Cabin.

03:22.896 --> 03:25.068
But nothing covers grey water.

03:25.137 --> 03:27.344
- They're writing a book
and it is bound to be huge.

03:27.413 --> 03:30.482
They're in the conference room.
I think they're flipping it.

03:37.517 --> 03:39.862
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God!

03:39.931 --> 03:41.448
- Hi, I'm Cameron.
- Hi, I'm Liza.

03:41.517 --> 03:42.620
- Hi, a pleasure.
- Wow.

03:42.689 --> 03:44.758
- Hey, there.
- Hi, Liza.

03:44.827 --> 03:47.275
I feel like I'm in West Elm.

03:47.344 --> 03:50.137
- This is the shiplap?
- Yeah.

03:50.206 --> 03:52.724
- And where are the chairs?
- We couldn't pitch

03:52.793 --> 03:54.827
without giving your office
the "New York Flip" treatment.

03:54.896 --> 03:56.206
- Huh?
- Please come over

03:56.275 --> 03:57.655
to my apartment any time.

03:57.724 --> 04:01.379
Our living green wall
is, uh--mold.

04:01.448 --> 04:03.586
Let's sit.
- Okay.

04:03.655 --> 04:06.793
So renovating is our third leg.

04:06.862 --> 04:08.482
That's the title of our new
couple's self-help book

04:08.551 --> 04:09.758
meets DIY manual.

04:09.827 --> 04:11.275
- "Third Leg?"
- Exactly.

04:11.344 --> 04:13.586
So it will feature
our building and design tips,

04:13.655 --> 04:16.448
but also explore how
relationships like ours

04:16.517 --> 04:17.965
thrive with a third leg.

04:18.034 --> 04:21.103
Whether it's a shared hobby,
weekly activity,

04:21.172 --> 04:22.724
even binging a TV series.

04:22.793 --> 04:25.068
It's healthier than just
focusing on each other.

04:25.137 --> 04:26.724
- Yeah, because we all know
how that ends, right?

04:26.793 --> 04:28.103
You can't renovate
your partner.

04:28.172 --> 04:30.448
- Believe me, I've tried.
- Yes, you have.

04:30.517 --> 04:31.827
- Are any of you married?

04:31.896 --> 04:33.379
- No.
- Came close.

04:33.448 --> 04:35.655
- Divorced.
- Uh, dating?

04:35.724 --> 04:37.103
- Not successfully.
- Oh.

04:37.172 --> 04:40.068
- Liza's dating someone
with very long legs.

04:40.137 --> 04:43.172
Some say he's
high-brow/brilliant.

04:43.241 --> 04:47.482
- Diana is dating a very sweet,
handsome plumber named Enzo.

04:47.551 --> 04:49.000
- Oh, so what do you two
do together?

04:49.068 --> 04:51.620
- Oh, where to start?
- Please don't say sex.

04:51.689 --> 04:53.724
- We go to the opera.
Enzo loves Puccini,

04:53.793 --> 04:55.655
but I just find his arias
too sentimental.

04:55.724 --> 04:56.931
I'm more of a Verdi woman,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.172
which leads to much
heated debate.

04:59.241 --> 05:00.517
- I bet.
- Heated debate

05:00.586 --> 05:02.551
about your third leg
is very healthy.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.689
In chapter five--
- We enjoy fine wine.

05:04.758 --> 05:06.068
Italian cuisine.
We're regulars at Rao's.

05:06.137 --> 05:07.896
We're going there tonight,
in fact.

05:07.965 --> 05:10.689
Frank Junior calls us polemizzare piccioncini,

05:10.758 --> 05:12.724
which means
"arguing lovebirds."

05:12.793 --> 05:14.827
- Wonderful.
So we were thinking--

05:14.896 --> 05:16.379
- Of course,
we both speak Italian.

05:16.448 --> 05:18.482
- We get it.
Lots of legs.

05:18.551 --> 05:20.310
- Like a centipede.

05:20.379 --> 05:22.517
But not at all
like a centipede.

05:25.379 --> 05:27.793
So what happens if a couple
doesn't have a third leg?

05:27.862 --> 05:29.827
- Well, a chair needs
three legs to stand, right?

05:29.896 --> 05:32.137
So if it only has two--

05:32.206 --> 05:33.793
- Oh, it follows over.
- Well, then,

05:33.862 --> 05:35.068
Enzo and I are very secure.

05:36.827 --> 05:41.241
Speaking of chairs,
when will we get ours back?

05:41.310 --> 05:44.344
- ♪ How do you do it
like this ♪

05:45.448 --> 05:47.620
- What?
You did?

05:47.689 --> 05:50.793
How did you do that?
Lauren.

05:50.862 --> 05:53.655
Gemma is following me on Insta.

05:53.724 --> 05:54.965
- Okay, good.
Follow back, zaddy.

05:55.034 --> 05:56.931
Like for like.
It's polite.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.896
- I didn't set up this account,
I know that Clare wouldn't,

05:59.965 --> 06:02.241
and I'm whittling down
my number of suspects from one.

06:02.310 --> 06:04.965
- Hm.
- She has 5,000 followers?

06:05.034 --> 06:06.241
- I know, don't worry.
Okay, listen,

06:06.310 --> 06:07.551
we are going to get more.

06:07.620 --> 06:09.034
Food Baby has, like,
three hundy K,

06:09.103 --> 06:10.965
and it's not even
the same baby anymore.

06:11.034 --> 06:13.655
- Look, I don't even know that
I want her on social media.

06:13.724 --> 06:15.137
Clare has to approve of this.

06:15.206 --> 06:16.965
- Your baby mama
is already following.

06:17.034 --> 06:19.758
So is her potato loving
fam bam back in Ireland.

06:19.827 --> 06:22.034
Now they can see all
of Gemma's pics in one place

06:22.103 --> 06:23.931
so they don't have to come
and visit your place.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
You're welcome, peach.

06:27.413 --> 06:29.241
- Gemma!

06:33.275 --> 06:37.206
Oh, my God, I am a genius.
I scare myself.

06:39.758 --> 06:41.827
- You should have seen
their faces.

06:41.896 --> 06:43.413
We should be featured
in their book.

06:43.482 --> 06:46.586
A couple who is able
to balance their work lives--

06:46.655 --> 06:50.379
well, that's a little casual,
even for casual fine dining.

06:50.448 --> 06:53.620
- Diana, I'm sorry.

06:53.689 --> 06:55.034
We're going to have to cancel.

06:55.103 --> 06:57.655
Mrs. McGovern in 3C,
she's backed up again.

06:57.724 --> 06:59.482
- That is the third time
this month.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.137
So I don't get Rao's
famous meatballs

07:01.206 --> 07:03.206
because Guinevere can't stop
flushing her makeup wipes?

07:03.275 --> 07:05.206
- Being on call
is part of the job.

07:05.275 --> 07:06.896
I'll make it up to you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:06.965 --> 07:10.000
- I'll buy you a necklace.
Your choice.

07:10.068 --> 07:13.448
- The thing is, Enzo,
they choose me.

07:13.517 --> 07:16.931
And I want to be with you.
I don't need another necklace.

07:17.000 --> 07:18.482
I can't believe
I just said that.

07:18.551 --> 07:19.896
- I got to go.

07:24.448 --> 07:27.310
- ♪ I go out
in the night time ♪

07:28.517 --> 07:31.068
- Best behavior tonight.

07:31.137 --> 07:33.655
You're here as my girlfriend,
not my competitor.

07:33.724 --> 07:37.000
- Okay, no butt slapping.
Understood.

07:37.068 --> 07:38.965
- We just signed
an author couple,

07:39.034 --> 07:41.827
and this is the--thank you.
The celebration dinner.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.586
- Author couple?
- Yeah.

07:43.655 --> 07:45.482
Um, you'll recognize
them from--

07:47.344 --> 07:49.068
- Flip.

07:52.034 --> 07:53.758
- Liza?
- Hi.

07:53.827 --> 07:55.275
- Hi.
- Hey, Charles.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.793
- What a surprise.
- I love surprises.

07:57.862 --> 08:00.103
- How do you all know--

08:00.172 --> 08:03.241
ah, you also pitched
to Millennial.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.206
I didn't know, I swear.
- Mm-hmm.

08:05.275 --> 08:07.931
- So we had no idea
that you two were--

08:08.000 --> 08:09.827
- Competitors?
- Together.

08:09.896 --> 08:11.413
- It's fine.

08:11.482 --> 08:14.827
But can I ask why you
didn't sign with Millennial?

08:14.896 --> 08:16.137
- We really connected
with Charles

08:16.206 --> 08:20.206
and his passion
for literature, and you.

08:20.275 --> 08:22.137
- What, me?
- I mean, he spoke at length

08:22.206 --> 08:25.655
about his editor girlfriend
and your shared love of books.

08:25.724 --> 08:29.206
- Publishing is our third leg.

08:30.931 --> 08:32.551
- So hon,
share the cote de boeuf?

08:32.620 --> 08:36.517
- No, I'm keeping the halibut
all to myself.

08:36.586 --> 08:39.379
We split enough.
- I hear that.

08:44.344 --> 08:48.034
Well, lucky for you, I wasn't
too attached to that book.

08:48.103 --> 08:51.206
Millennials can't afford homes,
let alone renovate them.

08:51.275 --> 08:53.068
But gushing about
your relationship

08:53.137 --> 08:56.413
to get some business.
Hmm, that's not very high-brow.

08:56.482 --> 08:59.793
- It's a free market.
Just using what I can.

08:59.862 --> 09:02.965
- Are you using me?
- No.

09:03.034 --> 09:06.206
But I'm rapidly using up
all the money

09:06.275 --> 09:08.000
from mortgaging the townhouse.

09:08.068 --> 09:09.620
Zane and I have
created a presence,

09:09.689 --> 09:12.689
but who knows for how long?

09:12.758 --> 09:17.275
Right now, we are all
smoke and mirrors.

09:17.344 --> 09:20.551
Please keep that to yourself.
- Of course, of course.

09:20.620 --> 09:23.689
- I just hope there's some room
in your bed for me

09:23.758 --> 09:25.655
in case this doesn't work out.

09:25.724 --> 09:28.379
Because, uh...

09:28.448 --> 09:30.103
I could lose everything.

09:30.172 --> 09:32.517
- Doesn't that
make you nervous?

09:32.586 --> 09:37.034
- Yeah, I'm nervous.
Excited.

09:39.344 --> 09:43.413
- Oh, hello.
Very excited.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.482
- Come on.

09:49.862 --> 09:50.896
- Whoa, whoa, whoa,
are you just

09:50.965 --> 09:52.172
going to leave me like this?

09:52.241 --> 09:54.310
- I need to prep
for my next meeting.

09:54.379 --> 09:56.068
I can't lose
two books in a row.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.758
Competition is stiff out there.
- Ha, ha.

09:58.827 --> 10:02.172
- I guess you'll have to handle
the third leg alone tonight.

10:03.620 --> 10:05.172
- ♪ Always spinning on ♪

10:09.931 --> 10:12.137
- We lost "Third Leg"
to Charles?

10:12.206 --> 10:15.034
- Why are you wining and dining
authors with our competitors?

10:15.103 --> 10:16.896
Did you also help them
sign with him?

10:16.965 --> 10:18.275
- What, no.
They were celebrating

10:18.344 --> 10:19.482
and I was trapped there,

10:19.551 --> 10:21.310
trying not to choke
on my monkfish.

10:21.379 --> 10:23.034
- How is Charles doing this?

10:23.103 --> 10:24.655
Do you think he's using
his own money?

10:24.724 --> 10:26.896
- No, Charles would never
be foolish enough to do that.

10:26.965 --> 10:30.241
- Liza, can't you do some kind
of sexual jiu-jitsu

10:30.310 --> 10:32.103
and get him to talk?
- I'm not a Bond girl.

10:32.172 --> 10:34.620
We lost the book
fair and square.

10:34.689 --> 10:37.103
Let's get the next one.

10:37.172 --> 10:40.896
Okay, this is musical prodigy
Gloria Rivera.

10:40.965 --> 10:42.517
Discovered playing
on the G train,

10:42.586 --> 10:43.793
accepted into Julliard's

10:43.862 --> 10:46.000
pre-college division,
and now...

10:47.586 --> 10:48.862
The youngest ever
female conductor

10:48.931 --> 10:50.137
for the Brooklyn Philharmonic.

10:50.206 --> 10:51.689
- Of course,
they call her The G.

10:51.758 --> 10:52.827
She's amazing.
- We've been in touch

10:52.896 --> 10:54.482
for months about her memoir.

10:54.551 --> 10:56.758
She has tons of stories about
growing up in the Bronx

10:56.827 --> 10:58.482
and her musical roots
in Puerto Rico.

10:58.551 --> 10:59.827
- I love it.
Get her in here.

10:59.896 --> 11:01.344
- Tonight, she's conducting

11:01.413 --> 11:03.275
Brahms symphonies
in Williamsburg.

11:03.344 --> 11:05.068
You want to join?
- Count me in.

11:05.137 --> 11:07.344
- Me, too.
But orchestra seats, Liza.

11:07.413 --> 11:09.344
I'm not crossing the bridge
for obstructed view.

11:09.413 --> 11:10.758
- Let's get a book.

11:13.172 --> 11:17.241
- ♪ Losing our youth
in the city lights ♪

11:17.310 --> 11:19.344
♪ Holding on tight
to the good life ♪

11:21.758 --> 11:24.724
- Same carrier, snap!
- Oh, yeah.

11:24.793 --> 11:26.862
- I splurged,
but it was totes worth.

11:26.931 --> 11:28.724
- Oh, actually,
I got really lucky.

11:28.793 --> 11:32.448
My friend works in PR,
and we got this as a freebie.

11:32.517 --> 11:35.275
So light.
We love it, don't we, Gem?

11:35.344 --> 11:37.931
Huh?
- Wait, that's Gemma.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.965
Oh, my God, I follow her.
She's the reason I bought it.

11:41.034 --> 11:44.517
Girls, it's Gemma Loves!
Oh, my God!

11:44.586 --> 11:45.862
- I bought the same bucket hat.

11:45.931 --> 11:47.862
- That snot sucker
is a game changer.

11:47.931 --> 11:49.793
- My Amabella loves
everything Gemma loves.

11:49.862 --> 11:52.103
They should play date.
- Thanks for the likes, ladies.

11:52.172 --> 11:53.896
Don't forget to tag Gemma Loves

11:53.965 --> 11:55.724
in your posts
and your mommy vlogs.

11:55.793 --> 11:57.344
Thank you.

11:59.827 --> 12:01.689
- Are you promoting stuff
on Gem's Insta?

12:01.758 --> 12:03.310
- Uh, duh, yes.

12:03.379 --> 12:04.586
I thought Kelsey
was my meal ticket,

12:04.655 --> 12:05.931
but it turns out, Gemma is.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.206
I mean, she's like
a baby Midas, dude.

12:07.275 --> 12:08.724
Everything she touches
turns to gold.

12:08.793 --> 12:11.137
- No, no, no way.
We're not doing this, okay?

12:11.206 --> 12:12.965
We're not exploiting
my daughter.

12:13.034 --> 12:15.586
She's not some pusher
for consumerism, Lauren.

12:15.655 --> 12:18.551
- Oh, okay, fine, yeah.
So I guess I'll take back this.

12:18.620 --> 12:19.931
Yeah, and that BabyBjorn.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.827
And her
top of the line stroller

12:21.896 --> 12:23.448
for the sleeping girl
on the go.

12:23.517 --> 12:26.448
- But Gemma loves it.
- She does.

12:26.517 --> 12:28.758
She does love it.
Listen, don't cut off

12:28.827 --> 12:29.896
her college fund
because of your

12:29.965 --> 12:31.344
misplaced morals, all right?

12:31.413 --> 12:33.689
You're going to get free swag,
snack daddy,

12:33.758 --> 12:35.448
and you're both
going to love it.

12:37.241 --> 12:40.482
- ♪ Baby, love,
my baby love ♪

12:40.551 --> 12:42.655
- Gemma loves mini cupcakes.
- Yeah.

12:42.724 --> 12:44.275
- ♪ I need you ♪

12:44.344 --> 12:48.241

12:48.310 --> 12:50.379
- Yes, Gemma.
- ♪ Leave me sad ♪

12:50.448 --> 12:54.000
- A pair for me,
and a little pair for you.

12:54.068 --> 12:56.379
both: Gemma loves kicks!

12:56.448 --> 12:58.448
- ♪ Baby ♪

13:01.482 --> 13:04.758
- ♪ Need to hold you
once again my love ♪

13:04.827 --> 13:09.137

13:09.206 --> 13:12.689

13:12.758 --> 13:14.344
- ♪ Please don't

13:14.413 --> 13:16.827
- Gemma loves butt plugs!
- No, no, she doesn't.

13:16.896 --> 13:19.068
We're done here.
We're done.

13:19.137 --> 13:20.827
- Why?
- Yeah, we're done.

13:20.896 --> 13:22.793
- Josh, sex positivity.
Come on.

13:22.862 --> 13:24.931
- ♪ Baby, baby, ooh ♪

13:32.827 --> 13:34.827
- Hi, Liza Miller
from Millennial.

13:34.896 --> 13:36.862
- Oh, my God.
Liza, hi.

13:36.931 --> 13:38.172
Sorry for all
the back and forth.

13:38.241 --> 13:40.379
- It is so nice
to finally meet you.

13:40.448 --> 13:43.034
- Oh, it is, and thanks
for being so patient with me.

13:43.103 --> 13:45.793
My schedule has been
ridiculously hectic.

13:45.862 --> 13:47.655
I can't believe you're here.
- Since it's been so hard

13:47.724 --> 13:49.000
getting you in for a meeting,

13:49.068 --> 13:50.586
we thought that we
would come to you.

13:50.655 --> 13:52.620
I'm here with our publisher
and head of marketing.

13:52.689 --> 13:54.655
They're so excited to meet you
and discuss your book.

13:54.724 --> 13:56.586
- Me, too.

13:56.655 --> 13:58.758
Can we talk about that
after the show?

13:58.827 --> 14:00.724
- Of course, break a leg.

14:00.793 --> 14:02.344
You know, that never
sounds right.

14:10.103 --> 14:12.172
- What are you doing here?
- Hi.

14:12.241 --> 14:14.241
It's very nice to see you, too.
- Sorry.

14:14.310 --> 14:15.862
You just--you caught me
by surprise.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.482
Hi.
- Hey.

14:17.551 --> 14:21.862
I guess that I am here
for the same reason as you.

14:21.931 --> 14:24.482
We want Gloria's book.
- Well, get ready to lose,

14:24.551 --> 14:26.586
because she's practically
signed with us.

14:26.655 --> 14:28.172
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:28.241 --> 14:30.275
- Because I actually
know her quite well.

14:30.344 --> 14:33.724
- So do I.
We've been in touch for months.

14:33.793 --> 14:36.034
- Oh, months, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

14:37.448 --> 14:38.965
- Let's actually
talk after, all right?

14:39.034 --> 14:40.586
- You've got to be kidding me.

14:40.655 --> 14:41.965
- I did not come
all the way to Brooklyn

14:42.034 --> 14:43.620
just to watch the canoodle.

14:43.689 --> 14:46.724
- Here she comes.
Just be calm, okay?

14:46.793 --> 14:49.137
Is Charles here as your date?
- And in a better seat?

14:49.206 --> 14:51.379
- No, I didn't invite him.
He's--

14:52.793 --> 14:54.931
- I thought you said
you had this wrapped up.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.551
- I do.
- Did you know that

14:56.620 --> 14:59.655
Charles's family paid
for Gloria to go to Julliard?

14:59.724 --> 15:02.413
She's the recipient of the
Brooks Family Arts Scholarship.

15:02.482 --> 15:03.724
- What?

15:07.241 --> 15:09.482
- We are never
going to land this.

15:09.551 --> 15:11.000
- No.

15:12.344 --> 15:13.586
- Come on, let's get
out of here.

15:13.655 --> 15:14.931
Let's go.

15:17.241 --> 15:19.620
- No, no, no, wait--
all: Shh!

15:23.793 --> 15:25.448
- All right.

15:26.724 --> 15:28.620
Can I give you cowgirls
some pointers?

15:28.689 --> 15:30.517
I'm the resident ax-pert.

15:32.413 --> 15:34.172
Okay.

15:36.137 --> 15:39.000
Step one: A firm grip.

15:44.517 --> 15:46.413
- I think we've got it covered.

15:46.482 --> 15:49.758
- We have a lot of rage.
- I see that.

15:49.827 --> 15:51.551
Leave you to it.

15:53.724 --> 15:55.896
You know, if only Charles
was that easy to beat.

15:55.965 --> 15:58.793
He is buying every book
that we want.

15:58.862 --> 16:01.620
It's not my fault that he got
ousted from his own company.

16:01.689 --> 16:04.068
It's like he has
a vendetta against me.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.655
He wants to see me fail.

16:05.724 --> 16:08.517
And the person who
I need the most

16:08.586 --> 16:11.137
is sleeping with the enemy.

16:11.206 --> 16:12.896
- You got to get a handle
on this, Kelsey,

16:12.965 --> 16:15.586
because Liza and Charles dating
and her working with us?

16:15.655 --> 16:18.034
That is not compatible.
- Do you think that she's

16:18.103 --> 16:20.241
actually helping him
land these authors?

16:20.310 --> 16:22.517
- Maybe not consciously,
but as publisher,

16:22.586 --> 16:24.344
you deserve to know
where her loyalties lie.

16:24.413 --> 16:27.275
She has to choose.
Yes!

16:29.000 --> 16:30.620
I wish I could
make Enzo choose.

16:30.689 --> 16:33.068
I'm in competition
with every seeping cistern

16:33.137 --> 16:34.586
in the greater New York area.

16:34.655 --> 16:36.413
"Now servicing all five
boroughs and Hoboken."

16:36.482 --> 16:37.931
Hoboken!
- It sounds like

16:38.000 --> 16:41.206
he works a lot.
- He's on call like a surgeon.

16:41.275 --> 16:44.000
Which is what I tell
most people he is.

16:44.068 --> 16:46.586
- They both wear gloves
- Oh, all this toilet talk

16:46.655 --> 16:48.793
is making me need
the little cowgirl's room.

16:48.862 --> 16:52.793
- Let's not call it that.
- Oh, typical.

16:52.862 --> 16:55.068
Where's Enzo
when I really need him?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.689
Follow me, cowgirl.

17:01.379 --> 17:02.689
All clear.

17:02.758 --> 17:04.551
- I can't believe
I'm doing this.

17:11.103 --> 17:12.482
Be cool, be cool.
- I am cool.

17:12.551 --> 17:14.689
- Ma'am, public urination
is illegal.

17:14.758 --> 17:16.517
- Uh, no, I was doing
nothing of the sort.

17:16.586 --> 17:18.448
- Afraid I'm going
to have to cite you.

17:18.517 --> 17:22.793
- No, or, or, or, I could make
a donation to your department.

17:22.862 --> 17:25.517
- Ma'am, bribery is a felony.
Let me see your ID, please.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.793
- What?
Okay, that's insane.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.620
We're in Brooklyn.
Everybody pees everywhere.

17:29.689 --> 17:31.586
- Drop your weapon!
- I don't know her.

17:31.655 --> 17:34.206
- Drop it.
- Free to go, just--

17:34.275 --> 17:36.758
- Hey, get back here!
You, drop it.

17:38.206 --> 17:39.724
- This is complete bullshit.

17:46.344 --> 17:48.793
- Gloria, this is
my girlfriend, Liza.

17:48.862 --> 17:50.482
- That's very funny, Charles.
We've met.

17:50.551 --> 17:52.034
And you two knowing
each other quite well

17:52.103 --> 17:54.137
is quite the understatement.

17:54.206 --> 17:56.551
Gloria, I assume you'll
be signing with Mercury?

17:56.620 --> 17:58.310
- I haven't decided,

17:58.379 --> 18:00.827
but the Brooks'
have been so supportive.

18:00.896 --> 18:02.689
And I didn't know about
Charles's new imprint

18:02.758 --> 18:05.793
until my agent told me.
I'm sorry, Liza.

18:05.862 --> 18:08.103
- It's not your fault.
But for the record,

18:08.172 --> 18:10.206
Millennial is the right home
for you.

18:10.275 --> 18:13.068
We're women at the top
of our game, just like you.

18:13.137 --> 18:16.655
- You can't lose whether you go
with Liza or with me.

18:16.724 --> 18:18.413
And a little
healthy competition

18:18.482 --> 18:20.241
never hurt anyone.
- It's hurting everyone.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.620
- Are we still talking
about my book?

18:22.689 --> 18:25.379
- It was a great show, Gloria.
Will you excuse me?

18:25.448 --> 18:28.103
- Give me one second.

18:28.172 --> 18:29.862
Liza, wait.
- I just don't know

18:29.931 --> 18:31.551
how much longer I can do this.

18:31.620 --> 18:33.620
The competition
isn't fun anymore.

18:33.689 --> 18:38.586
- I just need one hit
to attract an outside investor,

18:38.655 --> 18:41.551
and then, I'll be back
in the game in a real way.

18:41.620 --> 18:44.758
- That's a big gamble.
- I'm gambling it all.

18:48.482 --> 18:49.931
Oh, God.

18:50.000 --> 18:52.655
- You know, I get you got to go
when you got to go.

18:52.724 --> 18:53.758
But going in the street?

18:53.827 --> 18:55.275
It's an insult
to my profession.

18:55.344 --> 18:56.793
- I'm glad you find this
so amusing.

18:56.862 --> 18:59.103
But seriously, thank you
for taking care of us,

18:59.172 --> 19:00.931
and not in that way.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.827
- In what way?
- She thinks dating an Italian

19:03.896 --> 19:05.344
makes her Kay Corleone.

19:05.413 --> 19:07.000
These guys owed me.

19:07.068 --> 19:11.000
Because I recovered
key evidence from their pipes.

19:11.068 --> 19:12.620
One guy flushed a severed--

19:12.689 --> 19:15.034
- Okay, let's just keep
the mystery alive, shall we?

19:15.103 --> 19:16.965
- Hey, I got here
as soon as I could.

19:17.034 --> 19:19.758
Are you guys okay?
- No, we are not okay.

19:19.827 --> 19:21.965
We have been under
fluorescent lights for hours.

19:22.034 --> 19:24.310
- Yeah, Enzo bailed us out.
- It turns out having

19:24.379 --> 19:27.413
an on call boyfriend
has its benefits.

19:27.482 --> 19:31.586
- Let's get you home, jailbird.
Good night, ladies.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.586
- Hey, are you okay?
- Not really.

19:35.655 --> 19:39.137
We've got a huge problem.
Millennial is in freefall.

19:39.206 --> 19:41.482
We've lost Audrey Colbert,
"Third Leg,"

19:41.551 --> 19:44.551
and now, Gloria Rivera,
all to Charles.

19:44.620 --> 19:47.724
Are you sure you're not giving
him some kind of inside info?

19:47.793 --> 19:49.034
- Are you questioning
my loyalty?

19:49.103 --> 19:50.275
- Charles is your blind spot,

19:50.344 --> 19:51.482
and you don't want
to see him lose.

19:51.551 --> 19:53.448
- I don't want anyone to lose.

19:53.517 --> 19:55.344
I want Charles to win.
I want us all to win.

19:55.413 --> 19:57.413
- Oh, stop being
such a Pollyanna.

19:57.482 --> 19:59.655
There have to be losers,
and right now,

19:59.724 --> 20:01.724
Charles is making sure
that that's me.

20:01.793 --> 20:03.931
- That is not what he's doing.
- That's what it feels like,

20:04.000 --> 20:05.517
and that's why I'm scared.

20:05.586 --> 20:08.413
- Well, believe it or not,
Charles is scared, too.

20:08.482 --> 20:12.551
He's risking a lot.
More than just his reputation.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.103
- I get that,
but when it comes to business,

20:15.172 --> 20:16.655
you need to choose a side.

20:23.448 --> 20:25.724
- ♪ We can make this work,
we can make this work ♪

20:25.793 --> 20:28.206
- I don't know if this
is going to work, Mags.

20:28.275 --> 20:29.689
- Come on, if Gemma can love
snot suckers,

20:29.758 --> 20:31.103
she can love my art.

20:31.172 --> 20:32.586
I mean, I have to sell
all this old crap.

20:32.655 --> 20:34.758
- Oh, yeah.
- Why is this baby awake?

20:34.827 --> 20:37.206
- Gemma loves midnight.
- Oh, my goodness.

20:37.275 --> 20:38.586
Where have I been?
You've practically

20:38.655 --> 20:40.344
doubled in size
since I last saw you.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.137
- Yeah, and she's also doubled
in Insta followers.

20:42.206 --> 20:43.482
- What?

20:43.551 --> 20:45.137
- You haven't heard
of Gemma Loves?

20:45.206 --> 20:47.172
Where have you been?
- Oh, my goodness.

20:47.241 --> 20:50.103
- Yes, Gemma loves.
Yes, Gemma loves.

20:52.103 --> 20:53.517
How are you doing?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.931
- Too much work,
not enough this.

20:56.000 --> 20:57.586
You?
- Eh.

20:57.655 --> 21:01.482
Learning that more men's rooms
need changing tables,

21:01.551 --> 21:04.482
and that lifting and carrying
15 pounds all day

21:04.551 --> 21:06.413
is more challenging
than it seems.

21:06.482 --> 21:07.758
- It's a great workout, though.

21:07.827 --> 21:09.137
I looked like
a Russian shot putter

21:09.206 --> 21:10.137
when Caitlin was her age.

21:10.206 --> 21:12.034
- Sexy.

21:12.103 --> 21:13.310
- Charles.
- Hey, Maggie.

21:13.379 --> 21:16.034
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:16.103 --> 21:18.448
- Hi.
- This is Gemma.

21:18.517 --> 21:20.689
This is Josh's baby.
- Hi.

21:20.758 --> 21:24.000
- Congratulations, Josh.
She's beautiful.

21:24.068 --> 21:26.482
- Yeah, she is, isn't she?

21:26.551 --> 21:30.310
- Well, sorry for--
for dropping by unannounced.

21:30.379 --> 21:33.896
Liza, I'll talk to you
in the morning.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.758
- You two seem good.

21:45.551 --> 21:47.793
- ♪ Never got lost
in the feeling ♪

21:47.862 --> 21:50.655
♪ Never just fell so deep in ♪

21:50.724 --> 21:53.448
♪ Until got
tangled up in you ♪

21:53.517 --> 21:57.413
- Hey, where are you going?

21:59.620 --> 22:03.241
- Am I competing with Josh?
- What, no.

22:03.310 --> 22:05.517
But you are competing
with that baby,

22:05.586 --> 22:07.827
because she is damn cute.

22:07.896 --> 22:09.931
And she's not going
after my authors.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.551
- Well, I came to tell you
that you're getting one back.

22:14.620 --> 22:17.172
Gloria is signing
with Millennial.

22:17.241 --> 22:20.000
She loves your passion.
You won.

22:20.068 --> 22:22.482
- It doesn't feel like winning.
- Okay.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.172
The important thing
is I don't lose you.

22:24.241 --> 22:27.275
- Then let's end
this company rivalry.

22:27.344 --> 22:29.724
- I don't see it as a rivalry.

22:30.965 --> 22:34.793
I see it as sharing victories.
- How?

22:34.862 --> 22:36.965
- I still have my family stake
in Millennial,

22:37.034 --> 22:39.172
and I own Mercury.

22:39.241 --> 22:41.586
So as long as the books
go to one of us--

22:41.655 --> 22:43.551
- Oh, really?
- Of course.

22:43.620 --> 22:45.034
When you get
to the bottom line,

22:45.103 --> 22:47.620
it's still all me.

22:50.310 --> 22:51.896
- But that's
the problem, Charles.

22:51.965 --> 22:56.275
If it's all you,
then there's no room for us.

22:57.172 --> 22:59.862
- ♪ You're the one
that got away ♪

22:59.931 --> 23:01.827
♪ I was the one
who made mistakes ♪

23:01.896 --> 23:04.793
♪ Drove past our place today ♪

23:04.862 --> 23:08.793
♪ Heartache so bad,
it's bound to break, oh ♪
