00:05.171 --> 00:07.924

of fresh, organic granola.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.093
Paige, are you forgetting something?

00:10.176 --> 00:12.095
Oh, right.
The secret ingredient.

"The Granola Gals.

00:36.411 --> 00:38.204
Is it love?

00:38.288 --> 00:41.958
Because literally every time
you guys bake something, you say that.

00:43.084 --> 00:44.836
Uh, that is not true.

a ton of money selling this.

-No.

There's no such thing
as winning the farmer's market.

are about community.

They're about sharing the best of the
Earth with the people who inhabit it.

There's a lady there who bakes secret
messages into her fresh bread loaves.

I got one that said,
"You are totally unique."

01:22.749 --> 01:25.335

that said the same thing.

That's the kind of farmer's
marketeer we wanna be.

Generous and supportive.

Amelia, we're not doing
this for the money.

spending the day

Game recognize game,
ya feel me?

11:35.653 --> 11:37.197
No.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.409
Bernie, we need to call this woman back
right now and explain everything.

11:41.493 --> 11:44.037
That's a good idea - she seems
like a reasonable person,

11:44.120 --> 11:45.872
with a husband, kids,

11:45.955 --> 11:49.125
and oh look - there she is
winning a kick-boxing tournament.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.836
Oh, no. That's an illegal street fight.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.631
Bernie, just give me the phone.

11:55.799 --> 11:56.633
[phone ringing]

11:58.468 --> 12:01.888
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the phone stealer.

12:03.056 --> 12:06.935
Hi, ma'am. I just wanted
to say this whole thing

12:07.018 --> 12:08.853
was a big misunderstanding.

12:08.937 --> 12:11.398
From your photos,
you seem like a nice person--

12:11.481 --> 12:13.942
Wait! You're going through
my private photos now?!

12:14.025 --> 12:15.694
Uh...

12:15.777 --> 12:18.530
Might I suggest setting
a passcode on your phone.

12:18.613 --> 12:20.073
<i>You can use any</i>
<i>number you want.</i>

12:20.156 --> 12:23.618
I recommend a five. Or a three.

12:23.702 --> 12:25.328
Sevens are a little scary.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.540
You know,
'cause seven "ate" nine.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.000
[laughs nervously]

12:31.751 --> 12:35.046
I'm gonna find you and rip you to shreds!
[grunts]

12:35.422 --> 12:37.549
Okay, not a fan of number humor.

12:38.800 --> 12:40.051
Wait,

12:40.135 --> 12:42.721
this doesn't sound like the same
person I talked to before.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.389
Is this Frankie Wong?

12:44.472 --> 12:46.266
Uh... No, no...Uh...

12:46.349 --> 12:48.435
It's...

12:48.518 --> 12:49.644
Paige Olvera!

12:51.187 --> 12:53.356
[snarling]

12:56.026 --> 12:57.652
Weird day, huh?

13:01.865 --> 13:02.991
All right, ladies.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.410
Time to put your training
to the test.

13:05.493 --> 13:06.494
Who's the target?

13:06.578 --> 13:07.495
[both]
The Granola Grandma!

13:08.413 --> 13:09.414
Who do you trust?

13:09.497 --> 13:10.331
[both]
No one!

13:10.540 --> 13:12.000
How do you say things?

13:12.083 --> 13:13.918
[both]
At the same time!

13:15.253 --> 13:16.504
You're ready.

13:16.588 --> 13:17.839
Good luck, ladies.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.884
I'm gonna take a lap and see what this
freak show is all about.

13:23.094 --> 13:24.846
All right.
Let's get our game faces on.

13:27.098 --> 13:28.808
[both snarl]

13:33.563 --> 13:34.606
What's that?

13:34.689 --> 13:37.859
Oh, I made some of my
famous artisanal lemonade.

13:37.942 --> 13:40.945
Yeah, but we're selling
granola, not lemonade.

13:41.029 --> 13:43.156
I know, I just thought
we'd attract more customers

13:43.239 --> 13:45.450
if we offered something light
and refreshing to wash it down.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.368
[scoffs]
I'm sorry,

13:47.369 --> 13:49.829
are you saying
my granola is dry?

13:51.206 --> 13:54.250
Okay, first of all,
it's our granola.

13:54.376 --> 13:55.210
[gasps]

13:55.543 --> 13:56.878
I see what you're doing.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.214
Lesson one:
If you want something, take it.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.007
That's not what I was doing.

14:01.091 --> 14:01.925
[gasps]

14:02.217 --> 14:03.802
Unless that's
what you're doing

14:03.885 --> 14:05.762
and you're trying
to pin it on me.

14:05.845 --> 14:08.348
I'm not pinning anything
on anybody.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.392
Just hop on your stool
and start selling.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.268
Oh, is that a height joke?

14:14.104 --> 14:17.023
[gasps]
That's lesson two:

14:17.107 --> 14:19.526
Exploit your
competitor's weakness.

14:19.609 --> 14:21.027
Competitor?

14:21.111 --> 14:22.946
You're not my competitor.
Unless...

14:23.029 --> 14:23.863
[both gasp]

14:24.948 --> 14:28.868
[both]
Lesson three: Trust no one.

14:31.496 --> 14:32.997
You guys were right!

14:33.081 --> 14:34.958
The farmers market
is a magical community

14:35.041 --> 14:37.711
built on love and friendship!

14:37.794 --> 14:39.879
You're going down,
Lemonade Gal.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.298
No, you're going down,
Granola Gal,

14:42.382 --> 14:44.092
who's now my ex-pal.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.886
What's happening?

14:46.970 --> 14:48.179
Why do you have
separate tables?

14:48.346 --> 14:50.557
Because everyone's
a competitor, Amelia.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.725
Just like you taught us.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.019
Except there is
no us anymore.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.522
It's every certified organic
granola maker for themselves!

14:57.605 --> 15:01.693
Or every artisanal fresh-squeezed
non-organic lemonade maker.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.944
I couldn't get organic lemons,

15:03.028 --> 15:04.029
there was a delayed shipment,

15:04.112 --> 15:06.406
something about a truck driver
strike in San Pedro!

15:07.866 --> 15:09.743
I'm gonna make so much more
money than you.

15:09.826 --> 15:12.078
I'm gonna make so much more
money than you.

15:12.162 --> 15:13.913
And I think skipping is dumb!

15:13.997 --> 15:15.123
Burn!

15:16.041 --> 15:17.876
Well you know
how the saying goes.

15:18.001 --> 15:19.377
When life gives you lemons...

15:19.461 --> 15:21.588
-wear an ugly braid.
-[gasps]

15:22.964 --> 15:24.549
Burn re-turned.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.888
Oh dear.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.015
It's the double
Eye of the Duckworth!

15:33.141 --> 15:34.768
[suspenseful music playing]

15:37.020 --> 15:39.773
No way, Horse Face Guy,

15:39.856 --> 15:41.983
you're playing
the farmers market?!

15:45.362 --> 15:46.196
[upbeat music playing]

15:47.280 --> 15:48.990
Who wants lemonade?

15:49.074 --> 15:51.409
You wants organic granola?

15:52.869 --> 15:55.789
Okay, it might not be organic,
but it's still artisanal.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.040
Artisanal!

15:58.249 --> 16:02.087
Guys, what happened?
You were on the same team.

16:02.170 --> 16:04.881
Ask your sister. She's the one
who went all berserk on me.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.802
You're the one who went lemonade berserk,
you lemonade backstabber.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.263
Okay, just adding
the word "lemonade"

16:12.347 --> 16:14.683
in the middle of a sentence
doesn't make it an insult.

16:14.766 --> 16:18.269
You would lemonade know,
you bossy lemonade pants.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.106
Okay, that one actually stung.

16:22.232 --> 16:25.110
Guys, it doesn't have to
be like this.

16:25.193 --> 16:29.155
You told me the farmers market
was all about unity and harmony.

16:29.239 --> 16:32.117
-Well, meet Kenny and Russell.
-Howdy.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.452
Kenny and Russell
are best friends

16:34.536 --> 16:37.872
and they don't mind that they both sell
carrots at the same farmers market.

16:37.956 --> 16:40.417
Wait a minute.
You sell carrots?

16:40.500 --> 16:41.835
That's my thing.

16:41.918 --> 16:43.586
You told me
you sold rhubarb!

16:43.670 --> 16:45.880
You're a dead man,
Russell!

16:48.133 --> 16:49.300
Okay, so...

16:49.384 --> 16:53.263
Kenny and Russell clearly have some issues
they need to work out.

16:53.430 --> 16:56.099
-My customer!
-No, my customer!

16:56.182 --> 16:57.934
Let go of
my bearded hipster!

16:58.018 --> 17:01.479
You let go! I saw
his public radio t-shirt first!

17:03.690 --> 17:05.734
Look what you did!
You just cost me a customer!

17:05.817 --> 17:07.819
You cost yourself a customer,

17:07.902 --> 17:11.114
you customer-costing
lemonade customer-coster.

17:12.490 --> 17:15.368
Lemonade was not a necessary
part of that sentence!

17:15.452 --> 17:17.328
Yes it lemonade was!

17:18.246 --> 17:20.081
Gah! I can't take this anymore!

17:20.165 --> 17:21.332
I'm gonna go get more cups.

17:21.416 --> 17:23.960
And I'm not lemonade
done with you.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.713
What did that even mean?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.632
<i>♪ Hey! Hey! ♪</i>

17:31.426 --> 17:33.053
Oh no, we're too late!

17:33.136 --> 17:36.222
What? Did that scary
cell phone lady find Paige?

17:36.306 --> 17:39.309
No, the peach guy's
out of free samples.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.853
Bernie, focus,
we're here to find...Paige!

17:41.936 --> 17:44.230
[screams] What are you doing here?
What's wrong?

17:44.314 --> 17:46.941
[laughs nervously]
Uh, nothing's wrong.

17:47.025 --> 17:48.151
Nothing's wrong at all.

17:48.234 --> 17:49.611
Hey, you know where things
are really not wrong?

17:49.694 --> 17:51.279
The beautiful beaches of Mexico.

17:51.363 --> 17:52.739
Or even Australia.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.242
Yeah, so I packed your bag with a fake
passport, food and disguises.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.244
Now once you get to Australia,

17:58.328 --> 18:00.288
your name is no longer
Paige Olvera,

18:00.372 --> 18:02.248
it's Pludge O'Mara.
Good, right?

18:02.332 --> 18:03.958
Ready to hit the road, Pludge?

18:04.042 --> 18:05.377
Ah! It's so bad, Bernie.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.964
Guys, I don't know what you're talking
about and I don't care.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.383
I've got lemonade to sell,

18:11.466 --> 18:13.176
and I checked into
all my social media sites,

18:13.259 --> 18:15.637
and let the world know
exactly where I am.

18:15.720 --> 18:18.223
If you're looking
for Paige Olvera,

18:18.306 --> 18:21.309
you're gonna find Paige Olvera.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.227
[both]
Plan B.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.854
-Stop! Put me down!
-This is for your own good.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.731
We have to get you
out of here, Paige.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.191
She means Pludge.
Pludge O'Mara!

18:28.274 --> 18:30.527
And she has the ID to prove it.

18:30.610 --> 18:31.736
Guys, quit it!

18:31.820 --> 18:33.321
In the time I've wasted
talking to you,

18:33.405 --> 18:35.031
Willow's probably sold
ten bags of granola.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.366
If you don't leave here right now,

18:36.449 --> 18:37.701
something really bad is
gonna happen to you.

18:37.784 --> 18:40.286
No, something bad
is gonna happen to you

18:40.370 --> 18:41.830
if you don't get out of my face.

18:44.249 --> 18:45.750
Did you just throw a cup at me?

18:45.875 --> 18:47.627
Oh, I don't know.
Let me check.

18:47.711 --> 18:50.088
She did it again.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.882
Okay. Okay, okay.
We'll leave. Just no more cups!

18:55.218 --> 18:57.262
Hey, but if the peach guy happens
to put out more samples

18:57.345 --> 18:58.221
Get out of here!

19:02.600 --> 19:05.311
Mmm, granola!

19:05.395 --> 19:07.480
Mmm, lemonade!

19:07.564 --> 19:08.982
They go so well together.
[laughs nervously]

19:10.358 --> 19:11.943
Just like old friends!

19:13.194 --> 19:15.405
You carrot lowlife!
I will carrot get you!

19:17.115 --> 19:18.366
See? It's a thing.

19:19.284 --> 19:21.286
-You're a thing!
-You're a thing!

19:21.369 --> 19:22.954
How can I trust you?
What does that even mean?

19:23.038 --> 19:24.789
-It doesn't mean any--
-Guys! Stop!

19:24.873 --> 19:26.750
I was wrong.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.084
You can't win
the farmers market.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.880
I should never have taught you
the Eye of the Duckworth.

19:31.963 --> 19:34.299
It has no place
in a civil society.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.635
Well looky what we have here.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.387
I've already met the loser gang.

19:39.471 --> 19:42.974
I didn't know their loser president
was going to be here too.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.186
What did you say?

19:47.312 --> 19:50.273
Yeah, what'd you say
about my friend?

19:50.357 --> 19:53.902
Yeah. 'Cause that loser...
is my sister.

19:55.278 --> 19:59.199
Aw, you think I'm scared
of three tweenagers?

19:59.282 --> 20:01.284
What are you gonna do, selfie me?

20:03.411 --> 20:05.121
Which one of you
is Paige Olvera?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.999
I am.
What's your problem?

20:08.083 --> 20:10.293
My problem is I want
my cell phone back.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.379
Look, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.381
And I'm kind of
in the middle of something!

20:14.464 --> 20:16.591
Hey, I'm talking to you!

20:16.675 --> 20:20.804
She said she's kind of
in the middle of something.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.889
-But she stole my--
-Stole your what?

20:22.972 --> 20:24.140
Your confidence?

20:24.224 --> 20:26.351
Is that why you
have all those muscles?

20:26.434 --> 20:28.561
So no one knows
how weak you really are?

20:29.854 --> 20:33.274
No. I mean-- no.

20:34.567 --> 20:37.862
Maybe I should get huge like you
so people won't notice

20:37.946 --> 20:41.074
how aggressive I am
when I meet new people!

20:42.283 --> 20:45.537
But I didn't-- I just--

20:45.620 --> 20:47.831
Howard, put the boys
in their car seats.

20:47.914 --> 20:49.708
We're leaving!

20:55.588 --> 20:58.091
You were sayin'?

20:58.174 --> 21:00.885
Yeah. You were sayin'?

21:00.969 --> 21:05.306
We can't hear you, grandma.
Start talkin' or start walkin'.

21:06.683 --> 21:09.019
Uh...You can't catch
what you can't grab!

21:10.854 --> 21:12.605
[screams]

21:19.279 --> 21:23.324
That. Was. Crazy.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.038
Did you see your mean face?

21:28.121 --> 21:30.081
You were all, "arrgh!"

21:30.165 --> 21:33.835
Me?! What about you
and your "You were sayin'?"

21:33.918 --> 21:34.753
[laughter]

21:35.128 --> 21:37.380
That muscle lady
coulda killed us all!

21:37.422 --> 21:38.256
[all laugh hysterically]

21:40.050 --> 21:41.509
[laughter fades]

21:45.430 --> 21:46.639
Willow, what are we doing?

21:46.723 --> 21:49.392
I'm so sorry for getting
so competitive with you.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.394
I'm sorry too, Paige.

21:53.146 --> 21:57.233
You guys have something more important
than the Eye of the Duckworth.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.820
You have the "Aww"
of the Duckworth.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.530
[all]
Awww.

22:04.449 --> 22:07.369
Oh Russ, what are we doing?

22:07.452 --> 22:11.164
If those girls can settle their
differences, can't we do the same?

22:12.082 --> 22:13.166
Carrot shake?

22:15.460 --> 22:17.420
Russell, you were my best man!

22:22.967 --> 22:24.094
[screams]

22:25.470 --> 22:26.513
I didn't take your phone!

22:26.596 --> 22:28.515
It was Bernie Schotz!
I'll lead you to him!

22:29.432 --> 22:31.476
There he is! Go!

22:31.559 --> 22:33.561
Hey, Sheila.
Ready to get yoked?

22:33.645 --> 22:34.604
You know it, B-Money.

22:36.564 --> 22:38.566
What's happening?

22:38.650 --> 22:41.444
Word of advice:
If you ever lose your phone,

22:41.528 --> 22:43.655
make sure someone
as cool as Bernie finds it.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.365
You'll have a lifting partner
for life.

22:46.491 --> 22:49.035
Hey, let's flex our muscles
next to each other.

22:50.328 --> 22:51.871
[both]
Twinsies!

22:54.416 --> 22:55.250
[both grunting]

22:56.835 --> 23:00.338
This is the beginning
of a very weird friendship.
