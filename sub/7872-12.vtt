WEBVTT

00:19.452 --> 00:21.720
Ay-ay-ay!
(bees buzzing)

00:27.794 --> 00:29.161
(birds chirping)

00:29.163 --> 00:31.463
Oh! Looks like our birdhouse
is benefitting

00:31.465 --> 00:34.033
from positive word of beak.
(laughs)

00:38.405 --> 00:40.406
(eagle screeches)

00:40.408 --> 00:42.307
A bald eagle!

00:44.711 --> 00:46.545
It is!

00:46.547 --> 00:47.980
(screeches)

00:48.915 --> 00:50.382
Maybe he's giving those

00:50.384 --> 00:53.652
little baby birds some food.

00:54.921 --> 00:56.889
(screams)

00:56.891 --> 00:58.223
(screeches)
(gasps)

00:58.225 --> 01:00.426
Homer, quick!
Get your shooing broom.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.594
Marge, an eagle is
our country's mascot!

01:02.596 --> 01:04.730
Fighting him is like
kicking George Washington

01:04.732 --> 01:07.566
in his wooden nuts!

01:07.568 --> 01:10.436
Aah! (grunting)

01:10.438 --> 01:12.438
(screeches)

01:12.440 --> 01:14.440
(grunts)

01:14.442 --> 01:15.774
Ow. Ow.

01:15.776 --> 01:18.077
This means war!

01:18.079 --> 01:19.978
Boy, bring my toupee.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.918
Go ahead, boy.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.454
MILHOUSE:
It's working!

01:28.456 --> 01:31.957
It's definitely working!

01:31.959 --> 01:34.126
For once, we're finally
gonna catch that mouse.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.627
(screeches)

01:35.629 --> 01:37.262
Got you!

01:37.264 --> 01:38.931
Ha-ha! Stupid eagle!

01:38.933 --> 01:41.100
It wasn't the mouse
we were after. It was you!

01:41.102 --> 01:42.668
Marge, preheat the oven!

01:44.270 --> 01:47.372
(grunting)
(screeching)

01:49.609 --> 01:51.844
I got him cornered, boy!
Bag him up!

01:52.545 --> 01:55.013
(screeching)
(grunting)

01:57.383 --> 01:59.118
(laughing)

01:59.120 --> 02:01.620
Not so majestic
in a trash bag, are you?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.288
Oopsie.

02:03.290 --> 02:04.723
(puffing)

02:05.592 --> 02:06.992
Seems almost a shame

02:06.994 --> 02:08.627
I'm gonna have to bang you
against the wall

02:08.629 --> 02:10.929
till you die.
No!

02:10.931 --> 02:12.598
Let's take the eagle
to Shelbyville Animal Rescue

02:12.600 --> 02:14.333
where you took
that injured hummingbird

02:14.335 --> 02:16.301
you found on the front lawn.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.070
Uh...

02:18.072 --> 02:20.105
um...

02:20.107 --> 02:22.274
Or maybe we can nurse him
back to health

02:22.276 --> 02:24.776
and set him free in the wild.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.278
Okay, Bart, think of a name.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.247
Make it great-- insanely,

02:28.249 --> 02:30.582
unbelievably great!

02:30.584 --> 02:31.750
Squawky?

02:31.752 --> 02:33.118
Perfect.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.687
Just like when
we let you name Maggie.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.490
(humming)

02:38.492 --> 02:40.325
Squawky, until I met you,

02:40.327 --> 02:42.861
I never thought I could
love something bald.

02:42.863 --> 02:44.163
(screeches)

02:44.165 --> 02:45.330
Bye!

02:45.332 --> 02:47.065
We love you.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.601
(all gasp)

02:56.709 --> 02:57.943
Oh, my God.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.344
Brace yourselves, family.

02:59.346 --> 03:00.546
We're about to meet a being

03:00.548 --> 03:03.282
with intelligence
far beyond ours.

03:03.284 --> 03:06.418
Boy, give me my baseball bat.

03:08.688 --> 03:09.955
Hello. I'm Elon Musk.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.557
Die!
What the...?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.125
Dad, no! Elon Musk is possibly

03:13.127 --> 03:16.295
the greatest living inventor!

03:16.297 --> 03:18.630
You're the guy
who put wheels on luggage?

03:18.632 --> 03:19.998
Oh, bless you!

03:20.000 --> 03:21.633
Bless you!

03:21.635 --> 03:23.802
(crying)

03:23.804 --> 03:25.170
I'm-I'm not that guy.

03:25.172 --> 03:26.972
His company perfected
electric cars

03:26.974 --> 03:29.308
and then gave away
the patents!

03:29.310 --> 03:31.243
He changed the way
Hollywood drives!

03:31.245 --> 03:34.012
And now he's landed in our yard.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.249
On my son's bike
and on our mailman's leg.

03:37.251 --> 03:38.884
Honey, guess who crushed me?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.385
I'll give you a hint.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.387
His first name is Elon.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.489
Ah! That's right!

03:45.091 --> 03:46.091
So, what brings you

03:46.093 --> 03:47.593
to Springfield, Mr. Musk?

03:47.595 --> 03:48.927
What does bring me
to Springfield?

03:48.929 --> 03:50.596
Well, to start with,
I'm an idea man.

03:50.598 --> 03:52.097
It's my raison d'Ãªtre.

03:52.099 --> 03:55.100
Mmm, Raisin Detra.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.772
I've hit a dry patch.
I'm blocked.

04:00.774 --> 04:03.008
In my personal drought,
I'm traveling the country

04:03.010 --> 04:06.845
quietly by spaceship,
looking for... inspiration.

04:06.847 --> 04:07.946
That's so sad.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.448
Maybe we're the same.

04:09.450 --> 04:11.250
Two lost ships
in the intellectual sea.

04:11.252 --> 04:14.253
Each of whom could inspire
the other to reach...

04:14.255 --> 04:15.921
Hey, Elon, if you're interested,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.357
you could come to the nuclear
plant where I work tomorrow.

04:18.359 --> 04:19.725
I am and I will!

04:19.727 --> 04:20.792
Great.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.060
And if anyone asks where I am,

04:22.062 --> 04:23.629
just cover for me.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.197
Homer!
Fine!

04:25.199 --> 04:27.366
We'll both go,
and if anybody asks you

04:27.368 --> 04:30.302
something you don't understand,
just say protons.

04:35.241 --> 04:38.043
So... do you get satellite
radio cheaper in space?

04:38.045 --> 04:39.711
Homer, if we're gonna
carpool together,

04:39.713 --> 04:41.213
there's one thing
you have to know.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.448
Ass, gas or grass--
no one rides for free.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.884
It's as old as the Bible.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.953
No, it's that I don't talk
to anyone unless they provide

04:47.955 --> 04:50.055
the mental stimulation I seek.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.290
Ditto.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.492
(Lisa giggles nervously)

04:53.494 --> 04:55.093
Hi. I didn't want
to miss one more chance

04:55.095 --> 04:57.095
to spend time with Mr. Musk.

04:57.097 --> 05:00.098
It is such an honor.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.301
He is.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.636
And may I save that paper?

05:07.240 --> 05:08.807
"No ideas."
(gasps)

05:08.809 --> 05:11.143
That's sad.

05:13.813 --> 05:14.846
(gasps)

05:14.848 --> 05:17.316
That's even worse.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.689
(gasps)

05:30.296 --> 05:33.298
Aw, man, I wish those
were white meatballs.

05:33.300 --> 05:35.667
(triumphant orchestra
music playing)

05:37.170 --> 05:39.271
Oh, my. That's an idea!

05:39.273 --> 05:40.605
White meatballs--
synthetic meat

05:40.607 --> 05:42.007
that you can print
in your printer.

05:42.009 --> 05:43.675
Say something else.
Please! Now!

05:43.677 --> 05:45.344
Uh... don't tase me, bro.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.012
Chocolate rain!

05:47.014 --> 05:48.847
Tase, bro, chocolate rain.
Use electroplating

05:48.849 --> 05:50.849
to remove metal ions
from rainwater,

05:50.851 --> 05:52.184
making it suitable for drinking.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.385
What about the chocolate?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.453
We'll make the device a soothing

05:54.455 --> 05:55.854
chocolate color-- brilliant!

05:55.856 --> 05:57.222
He's taking your Homerisms

05:57.224 --> 05:59.124
and turning them into
his own great ideas!

05:59.126 --> 06:02.461
This is the most inspirational
moment of my life, but...

06:02.463 --> 06:05.430
unfortunately, this is my stop.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.300
Bye.

06:08.302 --> 06:09.968
Well, come on,
keep throwing things at me.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.570
Um...
(grunts)

06:11.572 --> 06:13.238
Oh, this is a break.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.406
We're-we're taking a break!

06:14.408 --> 06:16.208
(grunts)
(laughs)

06:16.210 --> 06:18.076
(both laughing)

06:18.078 --> 06:19.344
I got you!

06:19.346 --> 06:22.147
MUSK: You're fun.
Well, duh.

06:22.149 --> 06:25.517
Why don't have fun
like that, Lou?

06:25.519 --> 06:27.252
(huffing)

06:27.254 --> 06:28.420
Ah, Chief!

06:28.422 --> 06:29.855
Did anyone ever tell you

06:29.857 --> 06:31.256
there's a safety
on that gun?

06:31.258 --> 06:32.591
What do you mean
this thing?

06:32.593 --> 06:34.926
(grunts)
That's the trigger!

06:36.095 --> 06:37.929
What are you writing?
Share, buddy.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.265
Suggestion
for the suggestion box.

06:40.267 --> 06:41.500
Can anyone make a suggestion?

06:41.502 --> 06:42.934
Be my guest, but
I seriously doubt

06:42.936 --> 06:44.669
the old man ever reads them.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.439
Suggestion 8,432.

06:47.441 --> 06:49.674
Nix!

06:51.110 --> 06:52.611
Hmm, technically an order,

06:52.613 --> 06:53.845
not a suggestion.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.947
"Installing an MHD generator

06:55.949 --> 06:57.115
"would allow the plant to

06:57.117 --> 06:58.450
"operate at a higher temperature

06:58.452 --> 07:00.452
"without the tyranny
of moving parts

07:00.454 --> 07:03.455
using conducting plasma
as the moving conductor"?

07:03.457 --> 07:05.123
Excellent.

07:05.125 --> 07:06.425
Clearly the work of Lenny.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.260
That's the white one, right?

07:08.262 --> 07:10.262
Is this your suggestion?

07:10.264 --> 07:11.763
No. No,
mine was rubber mats

07:11.765 --> 07:13.432
in the decontamination
showers.

07:13.434 --> 07:15.467
Also, water in the
decontamination showers.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.035
Never!

07:17.037 --> 07:18.703
Mm-hmm. Mm.
Good Lord!

07:18.705 --> 07:20.272
Sir, you know who that is?
The man who's

07:20.274 --> 07:22.274
revolutionized the
car industry.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.376
Henry Ford,
good to see you.

07:24.378 --> 07:26.878
As healthy and vibrant
as Detroit itself.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.947
No, sir, this is Elon Musk.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.616
For some reason, he's sharing
a console with Homer Simpson.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.419
His mind is as rich as
an Italian wedding soup.

07:34.421 --> 07:35.887
Homer, what are
you thinking now?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.989
Uh, Pittsburgh 35, Dallas 31!

07:37.991 --> 07:41.493
(triumphant orchestra
music playing)

07:41.495 --> 07:43.428
Pittsburgh steel,
Dallas Cowboys...

07:43.430 --> 07:46.097
Robotic cattle herding!
Thank you, Homer.

07:46.099 --> 07:47.399
(gentle music playing)

07:47.401 --> 07:49.000
Sorry, that's something
I'm working on

07:49.002 --> 07:50.969
so that I don't have
to display facial expressions.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.137
(electrical crackling)

07:52.139 --> 07:53.805
Young man, I look at you

07:53.807 --> 07:56.475
and I see myself.

07:56.477 --> 07:58.510
How much would you charge
to work for me?

07:58.512 --> 08:00.479
I don't care about the money.
The whole monetary system is

08:00.481 --> 08:03.248
just a series of interconnected
heterogeneous databases.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.750
Could you repeat
that first part?

08:05.752 --> 08:07.085
I don't care about the money.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.587
Once more... with feeling?

08:08.589 --> 08:09.688
I don't care about the money.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.822
Now, let me feel the vibrations

08:10.824 --> 08:12.157
of your lips.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.658
(muffled):
I don't care about the money.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.260
And I want you to get your
fingers out of my mouth!

08:15.262 --> 08:18.263
Smithers, there's something
strange in his mouth.

08:18.265 --> 08:20.131
It's called moisture.

08:20.133 --> 08:22.434
Hmm, I see.

08:22.436 --> 08:24.269
Okay, Musk, what do you propose?

08:24.271 --> 08:25.937
Well, you'll need to increase
the capacity of your plant.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.273
You cover the costs,
you get 100% of the profits.

08:28.275 --> 08:31.643
Careful, Elon, he's not
as kindly as he appears.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.278
(creaking)

08:33.280 --> 08:35.313
Now, Burns,
what if everything in town

08:35.315 --> 08:38.316
not powered by electricity
were powered my electricity.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.652
The electricity you sell them.
Imagine that.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.787
(gasps)
My doctor says I'm not allowed

08:42.789 --> 08:45.457
to imagine, so I hired
someone to do it for me.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.158
Send in the imaginer.

08:47.160 --> 08:49.361
(humming)

08:50.830 --> 08:52.797
Oh, that's fabulous.

08:52.799 --> 08:55.634
Oh, my goodness,
I can see everything.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.701
I'm in.

08:56.703 --> 08:57.802
Oh, by the way, Mr. Burns?

08:57.804 --> 08:59.638
I haven't been paid
in a while.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.206
Here you go. Imagine.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.041
Ooh, Swiss francs!

09:03.043 --> 09:04.576
Time to take my wife

09:04.578 --> 09:07.012
for a night on the town.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.914
Hey, wait a minute!

09:10.516 --> 09:11.650
(sniffs)

09:11.652 --> 09:13.919
So, what kind
of lunch do you pack?

09:15.421 --> 09:17.022
Wow, Elon, you're
like Willy Wonka

09:17.024 --> 09:19.958
without the underpaid
munchkins.

09:23.529 --> 09:25.363
Uh, I'd like
to offer you something.

09:25.365 --> 09:27.599
But all I got is coffee.

09:27.601 --> 09:29.601
With cream!

09:29.603 --> 09:31.236
Come on, I want cream.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.604
Give it up.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.272
(grunting)

09:34.274 --> 09:35.607
D'oh!

09:35.609 --> 09:37.509
Cream and sugar are
one thing too many!

09:37.511 --> 09:40.579
(triumphant orchestra
music playing)

09:40.581 --> 09:42.347
Exactly, exactly!

09:42.349 --> 09:44.082
What if we made the
cream cup out of sugar

09:44.084 --> 09:45.750
so it dissolved in the coffee?

09:45.752 --> 09:46.952
Wow. Wow!

09:46.954 --> 09:49.120
Between your genius
and my nothing,

09:49.122 --> 09:50.789
we make a great team!

09:50.791 --> 09:52.624
Come on, give me a hug.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.292
Sorry, I'm not one for hugging.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.461
Well, I'm not one
for just talking.

09:56.463 --> 09:59.030
(violin playing romantic melody)

10:11.377 --> 10:15.046
Does that drone do date nights
with the wife?

10:15.048 --> 10:17.716
My partner, Montgomery Burns...

10:17.718 --> 10:19.217
ALL:
Boo!

10:19.219 --> 10:21.419
...and I...
(cheering)
Hooray!

10:21.421 --> 10:23.121
have exciting news.
Springfield Nuclear

10:23.123 --> 10:25.557
has electric solutions
to all of your energy needs.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.359
The Springfield Hyperloop.

10:34.433 --> 10:37.235
Electrifying the school to
replace the old power source,

10:37.237 --> 10:38.470
Willy pushing a wheel.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.473
(drumming rhythmically)

10:41.475 --> 10:43.174
And my passion project,
the Glayvinator.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.310
You have a Glayvinator, too?

10:45.312 --> 10:47.979
Is it, um, uh, patent-pending?

10:47.981 --> 10:48.980
Patent granted.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.682
All the years of Glayvining

10:50.684 --> 10:52.484
in my basement for naught!

10:52.486 --> 10:53.652
I'm a failure.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.153
Ah, yes,
everyone's been there.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.488
You have those
feelings, too?

10:56.490 --> 10:57.856
Of course not.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.991
If I knew how to make a fist,
I'd hit you.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.493
This is wonderful, Smithers.

11:01.495 --> 11:04.329
For once in my life,
something's going my way.

11:04.331 --> 11:05.630
I'm not so sure.

11:05.632 --> 11:08.099
Oh, another visit
from Mr. Worrywart.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.601
I don't trust Musk.

11:09.603 --> 11:12.337
Anyone with that much money
has a darkness in his soul.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.005
Says you.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.674
(sighs)

11:24.283 --> 11:25.617
SMITHERS:
<i>Mr. Burns?</i>

11:25.619 --> 11:27.819
Mr. Burns?

11:27.821 --> 11:29.120
Sir,

11:29.122 --> 11:31.122
Musk's ideas sound great,
too great.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.323
We're meant for wretched lives.

11:32.325 --> 11:33.958
We should pass on this.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.460
And before you reply, remember,

11:35.462 --> 11:36.961
I've never let you down.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.463
You know what I'm going
to say, right?

11:38.465 --> 11:40.231
Release the...
I was going to say

11:40.233 --> 11:42.300
"Get out,"
but your idea sounds better.

11:42.302 --> 11:44.302
(sighs) Can you give me
a ten-second head start?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.570
Of course.

11:45.572 --> 11:46.638
One, two, three!

11:46.640 --> 11:48.573
(barking)

11:48.575 --> 11:50.875
Not on my carpet.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.412
Attention,
fans of The Little Rascals.

11:54.414 --> 11:57.382
The last of them died today
in Palm Springs.

11:57.384 --> 11:59.884
Now it's time for traffic
with Arnie Pye.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.219
Nothing to report, Kent.

12:01.221 --> 12:02.887
Since Elon Musk gave everyone

12:02.889 --> 12:04.422
self-driving cars,

12:04.424 --> 12:06.591
there hasn't been
a single accident.

12:06.593 --> 12:08.927
(chuckles)
Well, you be careful
up there, Arnie.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.228
No need.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.931
Mr. Musk gave me
a self-flying chopper!

12:12.933 --> 12:14.099
Where's Arnie?

12:14.101 --> 12:17.502
Now I can get
as loaded as I want,

12:17.504 --> 12:20.538
which is pretty damn loaded.

12:20.540 --> 12:21.840
Oh, boy.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.008
âª Elon, Elon, you're my guy

12:24.010 --> 12:27.245
âª Since you came down
from the sky. âª

12:27.247 --> 12:29.481
(gulping)

12:31.851 --> 12:35.053
Car, go park at work so
people think I'm there.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.521
(horn honks)

12:40.259 --> 12:42.494
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Force of habit.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.531
Car, wake Grampa.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.267
(zapping)
(Grampa groaning)

12:49.269 --> 12:50.769
Thank you.

12:50.771 --> 12:53.004
Mm. (mutters)

12:58.644 --> 13:00.478
Bart, what are you doing?

13:00.480 --> 13:02.947
Disable auto drive.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.149
AUTOMATED VOICE:

13:04.151 --> 13:05.784
Foolish boy.

13:05.786 --> 13:08.720
You'll never guess
Elon Musk's master password.

13:08.722 --> 13:11.389
Musk rulez, with a "Z."

13:11.391 --> 13:12.791
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Password verified.

13:12.793 --> 13:14.626
Manual control enabled.

13:14.628 --> 13:16.728
(laughs)

13:20.432 --> 13:22.667
(tires squealing)

13:27.273 --> 13:28.573
Welcome, friends.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.774
I have invited you here to share

13:29.776 --> 13:31.776
in our first quarterly
profit report.

13:31.778 --> 13:33.278
I'm sure you're all
eager to hear

13:33.280 --> 13:34.612
how much richer I am.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.281
Now, to end the suspense,

13:36.283 --> 13:37.582
Elon?

13:37.584 --> 13:38.850
Thank you, Monty.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.585
At our current rate...
Yes?

13:40.587 --> 13:42.086
assuming
a linear growth model...

13:42.088 --> 13:43.655
Of course!

13:43.657 --> 13:45.690
...we are losing roughly
$50 million a quarter.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.826
Just remember, our purpose

13:47.828 --> 13:49.694
is to show the planet
how to save itself.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.095
Oh, the planet.

13:51.097 --> 13:52.597
I adore the planet.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.699
Do you know my favorite part
of the planet?

13:54.701 --> 13:56.367
Gravity!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.269
There are no trapdoors
on this podium, Burns.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.271
You just started
the PowerPoint presentation.

14:00.273 --> 14:02.507
âª

14:06.111 --> 14:08.346
No, no, no!

14:08.348 --> 14:09.614
Musk, you tricked me.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.282
Not a trick.
We sacrifice now to take care

14:11.284 --> 14:13.451
of the future in a way
totally determined by me.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.353
(groans) All I wanted was
to make obscene profits

14:15.355 --> 14:17.956
in the last year of my life
and leave it to no one.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.391
Why does God hate dreamers?

14:24.964 --> 14:27.632
Due to recent fluctuations
in my judgment,

14:27.634 --> 14:29.200
and the once
in a lifetime mistake

14:29.202 --> 14:30.668
of trusting another human being,

14:30.670 --> 14:33.972
I am saddened to announce
massive layoffs.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.674
Who will pay for my
radiation sickness treatments?

14:36.676 --> 14:37.976
Not my concern.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.544
But Musk was our savior!

14:39.546 --> 14:41.713
Your so-called savior
isn't interested

14:41.715 --> 14:44.215
in saving anything
but the world. Bah!

14:44.217 --> 14:46.918
Burns' layoffs have thrown
the city into a new depression,

14:46.920 --> 14:49.721
marked by the singing of songs
from the old depression.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.257
If you're old enough
to have suffered then and now,

14:52.259 --> 14:53.892
why don't you sing along?

14:53.894 --> 14:57.762
âª Now the rain's a-fallin'

14:57.764 --> 15:00.498
âª Hear the trains a-callin'

15:00.500 --> 15:02.834
âª Whoo-ee

15:02.836 --> 15:05.169
âª My mama done told me

15:05.171 --> 15:08.940
âª Hear that lonesome whistle

15:08.942 --> 15:11.776
âª Blowin' cross the trestle

15:11.778 --> 15:14.612
âª Whoo-ee

15:14.614 --> 15:16.281
âª My mama done told me

15:16.283 --> 15:17.682
âª A-whoo-ee

15:17.684 --> 15:19.417
âª A-whoo-ee
(clopping hoofbeats)

15:19.419 --> 15:22.220
âª Oh, clickety-clack
and it's echoing back âª

15:22.222 --> 15:27.725
âª The blues in the night.

15:27.727 --> 15:29.460
My final invention.

15:29.462 --> 15:32.363
A pill that removes all grief.

15:32.365 --> 15:34.299
(chittering)
Ah...

15:37.236 --> 15:38.603
(groans)

15:38.605 --> 15:39.771
(chittering)

15:39.773 --> 15:42.941
Oh, my God,
it attracts women, too.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.709
You're welcome, you're welcome,
you're welcome.

15:44.711 --> 15:46.978
(distorted):
You're... welcome.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.613
(whistles)

15:48.615 --> 15:51.950
You really came back
from that Tommy John surgery.

15:51.952 --> 15:54.452
Tell Musk there's more
where that came from.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.287
More of what? (groans)

15:56.289 --> 15:57.789
BURNS:
<i>Smithers,</i>

15:57.791 --> 15:58.790
the hounds feel terrible

15:58.792 --> 15:59.991
for what they did,

15:59.993 --> 16:02.226
and good news,
one pooped out your ear.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.829
We'll dip it in iodine,
and it's just like new.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.798
(groans)

16:06.800 --> 16:08.967
Also, I'm sorry,
I couldn't find the records

16:08.969 --> 16:11.002
of the shots the hounds
had which, in turn,

16:11.004 --> 16:13.237
led to all those painful
injections in your abdomen.

16:13.239 --> 16:14.472
(groans)

16:14.474 --> 16:16.574
Now, the reason I'm here...

16:16.576 --> 16:18.443
I've made the calls.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.578
I'm gonna have Elon Musk killed,

16:20.580 --> 16:24.682
and I'll give you a little
extra morphine, friend.

16:25.617 --> 16:26.784
(screaming)

16:26.786 --> 16:29.020
(dogs snarling)
Oh, right, that's a trapdoor.

16:30.255 --> 16:32.457
(groans)

16:32.459 --> 16:34.092
What's wrong, Homer?

16:34.094 --> 16:36.127
Is it that all your friends
are out of work,

16:36.129 --> 16:37.795
and it's kind of your fault?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.430
(scoffs) No, it's Elon.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.099
I don't care how much
he likes me,

16:41.101 --> 16:42.867
I don't want to be friends
with him anymore.

16:42.869 --> 16:45.503
None of his pie in the sky
ideas ever work out.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.705
Sky pies are lie pies.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.774
Of all the planets
in the universe,

16:49.776 --> 16:51.843
why did he have
to come to this one?

16:51.845 --> 16:54.112
How do you break up
with a guy?

16:54.114 --> 16:55.446
Here's what you do.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.048
You just take his hand,

16:57.050 --> 16:58.850
look in his eyes,
and say,

16:58.852 --> 17:01.786
"I don't want to be
with you anymore."

17:01.788 --> 17:04.188
Wow, you're good at that.

17:04.190 --> 17:07.291
It's gotten me out of a lot
of gym memberships.

17:07.293 --> 17:09.527
âª

17:10.896 --> 17:13.297
Sir, I have my concern

17:13.299 --> 17:14.966
about the team
of hit men you've assembled.

17:14.968 --> 17:17.301
They seem a little long
in the tooth.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.470
Nonsense. Just because
a man can't see

17:19.472 --> 17:21.672
or hold his hands steady
doesn't make him

17:21.674 --> 17:23.041
any less of a marksman.

17:23.043 --> 17:24.675
A yoga mat that rolls itself up.

17:24.677 --> 17:27.879
Silent Velcro, baseball tickets
that guide you to your seat.

17:33.185 --> 17:35.319
(gunshots)

17:35.321 --> 17:37.088
Sweet Columbian Exposition!

17:37.090 --> 17:38.389
Musk lives.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.391
But, uh,
three of your hit men don't.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.926
Recoil was pretty bad.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.161
Oh, my God, Oh, my God.

17:43.163 --> 17:44.929
You saved my life!

17:44.931 --> 17:46.931
Which is gonna make
what I'm about to say

17:46.933 --> 17:48.766
even more awkward.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.601
Whatever you want,
we'll make it work,

17:50.603 --> 17:51.836
right, Homer?

17:51.838 --> 17:52.937
Elon, Elon, Elon,

17:52.939 --> 17:54.605
I want to say
something to you,

17:54.607 --> 17:57.341
and I don't want you
to be inspired by it.

17:57.343 --> 17:58.943
I want you to listen.

17:58.945 --> 18:00.945
No!

18:00.947 --> 18:03.614
I don't want to be
with you anymore.

18:03.616 --> 18:04.782
Can I ask why?

18:04.784 --> 18:06.951
I could say
it's the being shot at,

18:06.953 --> 18:09.253
or the flat,
emotionless way you talk,

18:09.255 --> 18:11.789
or the fact that PayPal
was my idea,

18:11.791 --> 18:14.592
and I was just about to do it
when you came out with it,

18:14.594 --> 18:17.595
but really it's that this town
isn't ready for you.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.930
And neither am I.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.898
It's okay; I'll be fine.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.767
(gentle music playing)

18:22.769 --> 18:24.302
It's on your face, too.

18:25.104 --> 18:26.537
Well, I did save you

18:26.539 --> 18:28.406
one last prize
from the Cracker Jack box

18:28.408 --> 18:30.274
that is my brain.

18:30.276 --> 18:32.009
Use it as you will.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.378
On the Miami Dolphins helmet,

18:34.380 --> 18:36.948
the little dolphin is
also wearing a helmet.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.616
Why are they always
the most beautiful

18:38.618 --> 18:40.885
just when they're
breaking up with you?

18:40.887 --> 18:44.188
I think it's time to tell
my luggage to self pack.
(beeps)

18:54.933 --> 18:56.400
Good-bye, Elon.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.402
Our town will never
forgive you.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.438
Thanks for the real working
lightsaber.

(whooshing)

19:02.275 --> 19:05.176
<i>Ay, caramba!</i>

19:09.948 --> 19:11.449
(giggles)

19:11.451 --> 19:13.951
I just wanted to see
if there was a better life,

19:13.953 --> 19:16.120
even for a little bit.

19:16.122 --> 19:18.689
When you're 16,
I'll drive you to Cincinnati,

19:18.691 --> 19:21.192
and you'll see
what there is to see.

19:21.194 --> 19:22.827
Mr. Musk, before you go,

19:22.829 --> 19:25.363
is there anything you could do
to give a little girl hope

19:25.365 --> 19:27.498
that the world of the future
won't be as grim

19:27.500 --> 19:30.334
as all our current movies
forecast?

19:34.373 --> 19:36.340
I guess humanity
wants its change

19:36.342 --> 19:38.543
one birdhouse at a time.

19:43.148 --> 19:45.950
Hmm, for a man
who likes electric cars,

19:45.952 --> 19:49.120
he sure burns
a lot of rocket fuel.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.288
(moans)

19:50.290 --> 19:51.656
What's wrong, Dad?

19:51.658 --> 19:53.858
Nothing.

19:54.993 --> 19:56.627
Elon's log,

19:56.629 --> 19:58.829
Earth date, 25 January, 2015.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.498
I have left Springfield forever,

20:00.500 --> 20:03.434
but there are some things
I will definitely miss.

20:05.537 --> 20:09.373
The little dolphin
is also wearing a helmet.

20:09.375 --> 20:12.643
Wearing a helmet.
Wearing a helmet.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.844
I never thought I'd say this,

20:13.846 --> 20:15.746
but sometimes holograms
miss the point.
