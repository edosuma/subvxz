00:15.807 --> 00:18.184
Do you have any mascara
with you by any chance?

00:59.517 --> 01:00.727
And do it for the alumni.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.738
What a legacy that you've got

01:11.821 --> 01:14.157
kids that come back from 19 years ago.

03:43.306 --> 03:44.933
Yeah, that's not good.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.310
It is still bruised.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.694
It just was the baskets.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.153
Dude, I think Ashlee just needs to push.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.976
Yeah, that just got awkward.

07:52.930 --> 07:55.433
We don't, because we don't have
time for more injuries.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.691
Obviously, I wish you were still
in the pyramid, but...

08:13.868 --> 08:16.871
We gotta do the whole stunt
again because that was trash.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.683
Wait, when is--
When is showoffs? This Sunday?

15:11.911 --> 15:12.786
You just frustrated?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.707
You lost your air?

15:32.056 --> 15:33.432
I almost died four times.

15:33.849 --> 15:37.102
When Monica says full-out,
I'm going full-out.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.631
Are you gonna do
what Keke said to do?

16:05.714 --> 16:08.759
You're gonna go to the ER
in between practices?

16:08.842 --> 16:09.760
Yeah.

16:09.843 --> 16:11.220
Did you tell Monica?

16:11.303 --> 16:12.763
No.

16:12.846 --> 16:15.057
There's no one
that can replace you

16:22.815 --> 16:24.566
Cheerleading sucks.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.947
She doesn't know
that your ribs hurt that bad.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.115
She thinks you're stressed--

16:33.492 --> 16:35.035
It's just my ribs hurt.

16:35.494 --> 16:38.831
Keke told me to go to
the emergency room after this practice

16:39.540 --> 16:41.000
to get them popped back in.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.503
<i>How's your side doing?</i>

27:36.154 --> 27:36.988
<i>All right, what's up?</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:48.852
<i>But, look where you are,</i>
<i>look what you've done.</i>

28:51.479 --> 28:53.982
<i>It's so amazing.</i>
<i>I'm so proud of you.</i>

28:58.570 --> 29:01.072
<i>Your mama would be telling you that</i>
<i>every day, too.</i>

29:03.283 --> 29:05.368
<i> And she is.</i>

30:03.301 --> 30:04.219
You good?

30:04.302 --> 30:06.262
No,
the dumb bitch is annoying.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.200
The situation I'm having
with Allie right now, ugh, I'm over it.

30:27.909 --> 30:29.661
She be crying too much.

31:35.977 --> 31:37.228
I hae the pouf.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.099
That was so good.

38:41.861 --> 38:43.487
They're yelling at each other...

39:13.309 --> 39:14.727
Don't point fingers.

39:27.281 --> 39:29.784
Everyone's mad.
TT walked off the floor with his hands up.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.923
Huh, I wonder why that happened.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.761
Because she's not listening
to what you tell her to do.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.542
Everybody keeps saying,
"You gotta talk to her or call,"

47:24.424 --> 47:26.260
She's the only person
I worry about.

48:58.852 --> 48:59.895
What'd I say??

49:15.827 --> 49:17.120
I didn't think
I was gonna make it this far.

49:18.205 --> 49:19.873
Like, to Daytona?

49:21.291 --> 49:22.376
I knew you were.

54:50.620 --> 54:52.038
The queen has spoken.

55:26.614 --> 55:28.158
Did you leave Jerry in?

55:28.241 --> 55:29.993
- Yeah.
- Good.

55:37.292 --> 55:38.752
Give it your all.

55:38.835 --> 55:40.045
Just own that pyramid.

55:54.392 --> 55:55.477
Two good full-outs today.

56:51.241 --> 56:55.370
I don't care if I have to walk out
with a freaking pound of tape on my ankle.

56:58.039 --> 56:59.249
Your mom is calling.

57:40.123 --> 57:42.000
<i>Bad Girls Club </i>is the worst thing
that ever happened to us.
