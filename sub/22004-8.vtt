00:04.572 --> 00:07.575
(saxophone playing smooth jazz)

00:07.608 --> 00:09.610
(trolley bell rings)

00:12.580 --> 00:14.682
(sniffs)

00:20.188 --> 00:24.258
(trolley bell rings)

00:24.292 --> 00:26.660
Thank you for the tunes, baby.

00:26.694 --> 00:28.762
(saxophone continues playing)

00:41.775 --> 00:44.245
(music playing faintly on radio)
Hey.

00:44.278 --> 00:48.116
* I've got an angel

00:48.149 --> 00:49.250
Emily?

00:49.283 --> 00:52.153
* Somewhere, somehow...

00:53.421 --> 00:55.356
Hey, Emily?

00:55.389 --> 00:56.457
(grunting)

01:17.645 --> 01:19.513
Emily!

01:19.547 --> 01:21.081
Emily?

01:27.155 --> 01:29.223
(phone beeps)

01:29.257 --> 01:31.359
(panting)

01:31.392 --> 01:33.694
Pride, it's me.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.863
Something terrible's happened.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.500
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:39.533 --> 01:42.370
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

01:42.403 --> 01:44.672
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:44.705 --> 01:46.174
* How, how, how, how

01:46.207 --> 01:48.542
* Hey, hey

01:54.382 --> 01:55.549
* You gotta come on.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.420
SERGEANT GORDON: All I'm saying
is kid should've called 911

01:59.453 --> 02:00.688
first, Pride, then you.

02:00.721 --> 02:01.822
I know he's a sailor,
but still.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.357
It's a murder scene.

02:03.391 --> 02:04.925
Could look like
he's looking for cover.

02:04.958 --> 02:07.895
Not just a sailor, G, he's
Loretta Wade's foster son.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.364
He's family.
Still don't look good.

02:10.398 --> 02:11.899
But captain says not
to push it 'cause...

02:11.932 --> 02:13.467
it's you.

02:13.501 --> 02:14.768
Assault's NCIS.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.271
Murder's NOPD.
Okay.

02:17.305 --> 02:18.839
Look, I-I can't get ahold
of Emily anywhere.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.874
Uh, she's not answering
my text messages or my calls.

02:20.908 --> 02:21.842
Danny, come on, come on.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.877
You need to get that
cut of yours tended to.

02:23.911 --> 02:25.879
She called me at 11:00,
right before she got off work.

02:25.913 --> 02:27.848
She said she was coming straight
home, but she wasn't here.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.484
You got here what,
about midnight?

02:30.518 --> 02:32.186
Yeah, just before
then, which means

02:32.220 --> 02:33.554
Emily should've been
here by then.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.489
But then when I saw what
happened to her roommate...

02:35.523 --> 02:36.924
Why can't we find her?

02:36.957 --> 02:38.792
Okay, what if something
happened to Emily, too?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.961
No, no, no. Don't jump
to conclusions, son.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.296
We got a BOLO out on Emily,

02:42.330 --> 02:43.931
I sent her picture
to Sebastian.

02:43.964 --> 02:44.832
Danny.

02:44.865 --> 02:46.500
Danny, what happened?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.836
Are you all right?
God, you're hurt.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.571
Think this needs to be
stitched up right away.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.872
Just forget it, I'm fine, Mom.

02:51.905 --> 02:52.940
You can take him
if you want.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.475
He's been swabbed
and whatnot.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.510
Let's keep the captain
in the loop.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.945
Call me, I'll call you.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.413
Thanks, G.
Okay.

02:59.447 --> 03:02.283
When did you get back
from deployment?

03:02.316 --> 03:03.284
Yesterday.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.285
Yesterday?

03:04.318 --> 03:05.753
Why didn't you call?

03:05.786 --> 03:07.321
What am I, 12?

03:08.021 --> 03:08.856
Loretta,

03:08.889 --> 03:10.558
why don't you get him
to the hospital?

03:10.591 --> 03:11.792
Okay? Get him looked at.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.227
I'm gonna be here
for a while.

03:13.261 --> 03:14.295
Wha-What about Emily?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.329
Who's Emily?

03:15.363 --> 03:16.497
I know she's
in trouble, okay?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.665
I-I can't, I can't
tell you how,

03:17.698 --> 03:18.732
I just, I just know.

03:18.766 --> 03:19.933
What do you mean?
How do you know?

03:19.967 --> 03:22.603
Look, I knew she was scared
about something,

03:22.636 --> 03:24.638
or someone, but every time
she came close

03:24.672 --> 03:26.674
to telling me,
s-she wouldn't.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.676
It's like she couldn't.

03:28.709 --> 03:29.810
I need you
to find her,

03:29.843 --> 03:32.680
Dwayne, I need you to make sure
that she's okay, please.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.915
I'll do everything I can,
Danny, I promise.

03:34.948 --> 03:36.950
Thank you.

03:36.984 --> 03:38.652
Okay.

03:38.686 --> 03:39.920
All right.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.988
Go with your mama,

03:41.021 --> 03:43.424
get fixed up,
let me get to work.

03:43.457 --> 03:44.958
(softly):
Okay.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.501
LASALLE:
Front door was kicked open,

03:53.534 --> 03:55.269
assailant caught our victim,
Lauren Danskin,

03:55.303 --> 03:57.438
by surprise coming out
of the kitchen.

03:57.471 --> 03:59.807
Apparently, she's roommates
with Danny's girlfriend,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.275
Emily Birch.

04:01.309 --> 04:03.377
I got Sebastian
doing background checks,

04:03.411 --> 04:04.845
and looking into
area surveillance.

04:04.878 --> 04:05.879
GREGORIO:
Fully clothed,

04:05.913 --> 04:07.515
no sign of sexual assault.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.617
Looks like she put up
a pretty good fight, though.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.019
PRIDE: A lot of blood.
Any idea on cause of death?

04:12.052 --> 04:14.054
Yeah, pretty sure
it's a knife

04:14.087 --> 04:16.023
to the back of her neck.

04:16.056 --> 04:18.726
Look, straight up
to the brainstem.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.361
I mean, that's not luck.
That's taught.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.862
Killer knew what he was doing.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.865
Yeah, there's
torture marks, too.

04:24.898 --> 04:27.301
Didn't kill her right away. Why?

04:27.335 --> 04:28.168
SONJA:
Doesn't look like anything

04:28.201 --> 04:30.604
was taken from either
of the bedrooms.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.407
Jewelry, laptops, TVs, money--

04:33.441 --> 04:35.309
this definitely wasn't
a home invasion.

04:36.510 --> 04:37.811
What do you think, King?

04:37.845 --> 04:40.448
I'm thinking Danny's lucky
to be alive.

04:42.049 --> 04:42.850
How is he?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.386
He's worried
about his girlfriend.

04:45.419 --> 04:46.887
Can't say I blame him.
Mm.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.089
At least there's no sign
Emily was here

04:49.122 --> 04:51.492
at the time of the attack,
or that she was taken.

04:51.525 --> 04:53.727
Doesn't mean that the killer
didn't come for Emily, though.

04:53.761 --> 04:54.962
Victim was tortured

04:54.995 --> 04:56.397
for some reason,

04:56.430 --> 04:57.965
maybe for answers--

04:57.998 --> 05:00.033
answers Danny's
counting on us to find out.

05:00.067 --> 05:03.003
And we know how much
Danny means to you, King.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.304
We'll find her.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.040
We better.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.480
Have you heard anything
from Dwayne yet?

05:12.513 --> 05:14.482
Let's just
focus on you now.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.816
All done.
Oh.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.685
Thank you, Doctor.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.588
Why didn't you tell me
you were here from shore leave?

05:20.621 --> 05:22.690
I'm sorry, Mom. I meant to.

05:22.723 --> 05:25.526
Just didn't have any time;
I wanted to see Emily.

05:25.559 --> 05:27.361
Okay. All right,
I understand that.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.129
But you also understand
I'm your mother,

05:29.162 --> 05:31.131
and I'm gonna give you
crap for not calling.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.533
I know. I'm sorry.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.001
Just worried.

05:34.034 --> 05:36.937
It's okay. Well, when
did you meet Emily?

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
Um, February, I think,
at Mardi Gras.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.107
Mardi Gras?

05:41.409 --> 05:42.776
Well, all right, then.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.011
How well do you know her?

05:44.044 --> 05:44.945
Why are you asking this?

05:44.978 --> 05:48.682
I'm asking because
I'm trying to find out

05:48.716 --> 05:50.017
how much you know about her

05:50.050 --> 05:52.620
so we can help find her.
The more, the better.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.987
Who her friends are.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.856
Does she have family here?
Someone she would go to

05:55.889 --> 05:56.957
if she were scared?

05:56.990 --> 05:58.926
She'd go to me.
Okay.

05:58.959 --> 06:01.128
But when you're out to sea,
who would she go to?

06:01.161 --> 06:03.531
What are her hobbies
or people she visits,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.098
things she likes to do?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.701
What do you know
about her, Danny?

06:07.735 --> 06:08.802
I know I love her.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.372
And I know I'll do anything
it takes to protect her.

06:14.174 --> 06:16.143
What?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.680
You sound like Dwayne.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.415
(chuckles softly)

06:24.652 --> 06:26.620
SEBASTIAN: Not a lot
of surveillance cameras

06:26.654 --> 06:28.055
in Emily's neighborhood,

06:28.088 --> 06:29.690
unfortunately,
and the ones that I did find

06:29.723 --> 06:31.859
don't show much more than
silhouetted figures.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.861
I'm sorry.
Sorry's not good enough.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.128
We got a killer
on the loose,

06:35.162 --> 06:37.465
possible target
in Emily Birch.

06:37.498 --> 06:38.899
Patton's at his mom's.

06:38.932 --> 06:41.168
Can you work his facial
recognition software?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.670
Should I...?
No, I got it.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.204
Okay. Well, expand
your search.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.040
See if you can find a
match on Emily anywhere.
All right.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.876
What more do we know
about her roommate?

06:48.909 --> 06:51.044
Nothing that indicates
a motive for murder.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.046
And NOPD's
drawing blanks, too.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.849
Lauren Danskin,
Shreveport, UNO,

06:55.883 --> 06:58.185
scholar athlete.
Never been in trouble.

06:58.218 --> 07:00.220
Not even a parking ticket.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.989
There's not much
on Danny's girlfriend, either.

07:02.022 --> 07:03.457
Then we're missing something.

07:04.124 --> 07:05.559
Emily's roommate

07:05.593 --> 07:07.094
was obviously killed
for some reason.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.028
Well, you didn't let me finish.

07:08.061 --> 07:09.730
The fact that
there's not much on Emily

07:09.763 --> 07:10.798
could be a reason.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.065
LASALLE: Yeah,
Gregorio's right, King.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.001
Both of us
have done a deep dive,

07:14.034 --> 07:15.102
and so far all we got

07:15.135 --> 07:17.204
is a driver's license
and a credit card,

07:17.237 --> 07:20.741
both issued to Emily Birch
earlier this year.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.743
Only job was working
at the Erin Rose Bar,

07:22.776 --> 07:24.211
also just this year.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.746
SONJA:
Yeah. What about before that?

07:25.779 --> 07:26.814
GREGORIO:
Well, that's just it.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.148
There's nothing. No address,

07:28.181 --> 07:29.583
no car registration,

07:29.617 --> 07:31.619
medical records,
social media. Nothing.

07:31.652 --> 07:33.086
LASALLE:
Yeah, it's as if Emily

07:33.120 --> 07:34.822
didn't even exist
before this year.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.123
Then we got to
find out why.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.158
Excuse me.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.860
Special Agent Pride?

07:39.893 --> 07:41.829
Can I help you?

07:41.862 --> 07:43.697
I'm Dr. Christo.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.232
From Telegraph Road?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.134
I'm the one whose calls

07:47.167 --> 07:49.269
you've been ducking
the last several days.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.738
What's Telegraph Road?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.874
Office of the Director of NCIS.

07:55.308 --> 07:56.510
Sorry, Dr. Christo.

07:56.544 --> 07:57.678
Been a little busy down here.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.813
I'm sure you understand.
Absolutely,

07:59.847 --> 08:01.915
which is why I thought
I'd stop by in person.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.183
See if we could
finally connect.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.952
Well, it's a long
way from Quantico

08:04.985 --> 08:06.920
just to, uh, "stop by."

08:08.221 --> 08:10.290
Do you have a minute,
Agent Pride?

08:10.323 --> 08:12.259
Actually, now's not
the best time, either.
Sorry,

08:12.292 --> 08:14.027
maybe I was being too polite.

08:14.061 --> 08:15.896
You don't really have a choice.

08:21.569 --> 08:22.970
Follow me.

08:23.003 --> 08:24.638
When we're done, I want to know

08:24.672 --> 08:26.239
everything there is to know

08:26.273 --> 08:29.710
about Emily Birch before Loretta
and Danny show up.

08:29.743 --> 08:30.978
SONJA:
Copy that.

08:31.011 --> 08:34.314
Dr. Christo?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.216
Looks like HQ
sent over a shrink.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.585
Behavior Science
Group Therapist,

08:37.618 --> 08:39.587
I believe is the official title.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.154
Yeah, but I thought
we were done with HQ.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.790
I thought Pride got cleared.

08:42.823 --> 08:44.191
Apparently not.

08:44.224 --> 08:46.927
CHRISTO:
I apologize

08:46.960 --> 08:48.295
if this is awkward
for you, Agent Pride.

08:48.328 --> 08:51.098
Not awkward for me,
Dr. Christo. Unnecessary.

08:51.131 --> 08:53.233
Well, it's not unnecessary as
far as the director's concerned.

08:53.266 --> 08:56.103
Well, I've done everything
the director asked.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.671
Signed a personal
improvement plan.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.239
Kept HQ apprised on cases.

08:59.272 --> 09:01.074
Filled out forms.
Right.

09:01.108 --> 09:03.043
But you haven't dealt
with what got you in trouble

09:03.076 --> 09:04.244
in the first place.

09:05.713 --> 09:08.248
What drove you
to risk your career, your life,

09:08.281 --> 09:09.683
to take down Mayor Hamilton.

09:09.717 --> 09:11.251
And that's what I'm here
to help you figure out.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.053
Well, there's nothing
to figure out. It happened.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.988
It's over. Hamilton's in prison,

09:15.022 --> 09:16.924
and that is that.

09:16.957 --> 09:18.225
Now, if you don't mind,

09:18.258 --> 09:20.227
I would seriously like
to get back to work.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.562
How long do you think
you can keep running from this?

09:24.397 --> 09:26.199
I mean, you're a smart man.

09:26.233 --> 09:27.735
You've got an
outstanding record,

09:27.768 --> 09:29.336
one of the best
I've ever seen.

09:29.369 --> 09:32.740
You must know that you have
some kind of... problem.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.309
There's got to be some reason

09:36.343 --> 09:38.946
you take cases
too personally sometimes,

09:38.979 --> 09:41.014
go off book, disobey orders.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.017
All because you feel compelled
to get justice any way you can.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.218
That's my job, Dr. Christo.

09:45.252 --> 09:48.321
Part of it, maybe,
but not all of it.

09:48.355 --> 09:51.258
There is something else
driving you, something deeper.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.726
It's the only explanation,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.228
and the problem is
it's only getting worse,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.364
which means if you don't do
something about it and soon...

09:57.397 --> 09:58.699
Oh, give me a break!

09:58.732 --> 10:00.600
What do you know?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.372
(scoffs)
What do you know about me?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.774
What do you care?

10:06.807 --> 10:08.408
I care because NCIS cares.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.110
You are a valuable asset,

10:10.143 --> 10:13.380
Agent Pride. NCIS needs you.
I'm flattered.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.048
And they're not about
to watch you self-destruct

10:15.082 --> 10:16.316
without doing
everything they can

10:16.349 --> 10:17.985
to try to keep that
from happening.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.419
I am not the bad guy,

10:19.452 --> 10:21.922
Agent Pride.
I'm just here to help you.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.657
I don't need help.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.158
(knocking on door)

10:25.192 --> 10:28.428
Hey, I'm sorry to
interrupt, but...
Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.964
Sebastian just found Emily.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.406
PRIDE:
What'd you find?

10:39.439 --> 10:42.776
Security camera from the bar
where Emily works, time stamp

10:42.810 --> 10:44.177
is just after
11:00 last night.

10:44.211 --> 10:46.446
That's 45 minutes
before Danny was attacked.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.448
That's Emily Birch.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.350
I matched her to a photo
that Danny sent.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.651
Hit play.

10:59.059 --> 11:00.360
GREGORIO:
She was abducted, Pride.

11:00.393 --> 11:02.896
Before she came home.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.898
Well, that doesn't make sense.

11:04.932 --> 11:06.967
Then what was the killer
doing at Emily's apartment

11:07.000 --> 11:07.901
after she was taken?

11:07.935 --> 11:09.269
Yeah, and why kill the roommate?

11:09.302 --> 11:10.670
Did you find her yet?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.974
Is Emily okay?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.453
(whistling)

11:26.486 --> 11:27.921
Do you have any leads?

11:27.955 --> 11:29.356
I mean, do you have any idea
where Emily is?

11:29.389 --> 11:31.391
I-I don't understand why
somebody would take her.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.360
It would help if we knew
a little bit more about her.

11:33.393 --> 11:36.096
I'm just saying, Danny.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.131
If there's something that
you haven't told us...

11:38.165 --> 11:39.232
I'm not withholding anything.

11:39.266 --> 11:40.333
Why would I?

11:40.367 --> 11:41.401
I would do anything for her.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.070
Dwayne, what would you do

11:43.103 --> 11:44.104
if it was somebody
that you loved?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.973
What am I supposed to do?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.440
You need to let
us do our jobs.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.210
Okay. I know you're upset,

11:50.243 --> 11:51.979
but if we're gonna
find Emily,

11:52.012 --> 11:54.181
we need to all stay focused.
What do you mean, "if"?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.886
Tea?
Seriously, Mom?

11:58.919 --> 12:00.821
Agent Pride.

12:00.854 --> 12:02.455
PRIDE: Dr. Christo,
please, this...

12:02.489 --> 12:04.424
I just wanted to let you know
that I'm gonna go.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.359
I don't want to get
in the way. I'll call you.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.361
Just make sure you answer.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.563
Who was that?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.365
It doesn't matter.
Look, Dwayne,
there has to be some...

12:12.399 --> 12:14.367
All right, listen
to me, Danny.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.803
You trust me, right?

12:15.836 --> 12:16.870
Of course I do.

12:16.904 --> 12:18.305
Okay.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.808
Then you know I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

12:20.841 --> 12:22.042
to find Emily, okay?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.211
To do that, I'm gonna
need your help.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.478
You saw the man
who attacked you.

12:25.512 --> 12:26.980
Yes?
Yes.

12:27.014 --> 12:29.182
Okay. Sebastian
and Christopher

12:29.216 --> 12:30.283
are in Patton's office,

12:30.317 --> 12:31.985
looking for the van
that took Emily.

12:32.019 --> 12:32.953
I want you to go in there

12:32.986 --> 12:34.822
and give them a description
of the assailant,

12:34.855 --> 12:37.124
as detailed as you
can remember it, too.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.392
Tell them they need to try and
find a match. You understand?

12:39.426 --> 12:41.294
I understand.
Okay, good.

12:41.328 --> 12:43.196
Go.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.934
He looks up to you, you know.

12:46.967 --> 12:48.902
He has from the moment
I adopted him.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.039
You're like the father
he never really had.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.374
And he's become more like you
than you know.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
I'm not gonna let him down,
Loretta.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.811
I'm not worried about
you letting him down.

12:57.845 --> 12:59.212
I'm worried about him
keeping his head,

12:59.246 --> 13:01.481
trying to do too much,
like his father.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.820
I have to go to work.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.122
Keep an eye on him.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.129
Where are we?

13:16.163 --> 13:17.564
We got a BOLO out on the van

13:17.597 --> 13:19.166
and Chris and Sebastian
are checking traffic cams.

13:19.199 --> 13:19.900
What about Emily?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.869
Know anything more
about her yet?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.403
No, nothing, and we've
been digging, too.

13:23.436 --> 13:26.139
We cross-checked with
FBI, NCIC, NamUs...

13:26.173 --> 13:27.174
Oh, we might have something.

13:27.207 --> 13:29.209
NOPD got a possible
on our BOLO.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.145
Black van in Central City.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.480
We only got a partial plate
from Sebastian's video,

13:33.513 --> 13:34.581
but it matches.
PRIDE:
Okay.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.984
Gregorio, you're with me.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.052
Sonja, keep digging.

13:39.086 --> 13:42.522
Tell Christopher and Sebastian
to keep an eye on Danny.

13:42.555 --> 13:44.157
Will do.

13:44.191 --> 13:46.226
PRIDE:
Let's go!

13:47.294 --> 13:49.129
DANNY:
Anything yet?

13:49.162 --> 13:50.597
What about Emily?

13:50.630 --> 13:52.265
I mean, she-she should've
shown up somewhere, right?

13:52.299 --> 13:56.036
Look, I know this is hard,
Danny, but it's a process,

13:56.069 --> 13:57.337
one we've been
through many times.

13:57.370 --> 13:58.405
All right?
We know what we're doing.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.207
I know. I'm just scared.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.209
Okay? I know the longer
it takes to find her...

14:02.242 --> 14:05.913
It may feel like a long time,
but it hasn't been,

14:05.946 --> 14:07.614
not from an
investigator's standpoint.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.049
You think she's all right?

14:09.082 --> 14:12.152
Honestly, we don't know.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.554
But the good news is

14:14.587 --> 14:16.623
since Emily was taken,
hey, that gives us hope.

14:16.656 --> 14:18.258
Right, 'cause it means
that they-they obviously,

14:18.291 --> 14:19.626
they want something
from her.

14:19.659 --> 14:22.362
But what could anybody
possibly want from Emily?

14:22.395 --> 14:24.097
You know what,
I'm-a call Dwayne.

14:24.131 --> 14:26.133
Maybe he's found something.

14:26.166 --> 14:29.302
Look, Danny, he-he would've
called by now if he had.

14:29.336 --> 14:30.971
Look, you got to trust us.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.205
Yeah, and you got
to trust Pride.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.573
He's doing everything
that he can.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.608
Yeah, I hope so.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.245
Look, I know he's been
in trouble lately.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.446
I know he's been
going off book.

14:39.479 --> 14:42.349
I know he's been breaking
the rules. Okay? Mom told me.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.151
What's that got to do with...
It's got everything
to do with it,

14:44.184 --> 14:45.986
especially if he's more
concerned about keeping his job

14:46.019 --> 14:47.287
than he is about
finding Emily.

14:49.189 --> 14:52.259
I'm-I'm sorry.

14:52.292 --> 14:56.063
I'm just so frustrated.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.231
I'm gonna get some air.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.940
(phone beeps)

15:24.257 --> 15:26.259
PRIDE: Watch the door.
I'll check the van.

15:32.632 --> 15:34.734
It's clear.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.236
Pride, pretty high-tech security

15:36.269 --> 15:37.404
for a travel agency.

15:41.241 --> 15:42.675
NCIS!

15:42.709 --> 15:44.277
Get your hands up now.

15:44.311 --> 15:45.412
Get them up now!

15:45.445 --> 15:47.047
All right, all
right, easy.

15:47.080 --> 15:48.248
We're not who you think we are.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.416
And who do we think you are?

15:49.449 --> 15:51.418
May I?

15:56.156 --> 15:57.224
U.S. Marshals.

15:57.257 --> 15:59.159
Wait, hold up. You guys are
the ones that took Emily?

15:59.192 --> 16:00.160
Emily? Emily who?

16:00.193 --> 16:01.761
We don't have time
for your games, all right?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.263
Woman's been murdered,
my sailor's been attacked,

16:03.296 --> 16:05.698
and that black van in the alley,

16:05.732 --> 16:08.368
we know it was used
to take Emily Birch.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.269
Now, I want to
know why now!

16:09.302 --> 16:11.338
All I can tell you is

16:11.371 --> 16:13.340
we got wind of an attempt,

16:13.373 --> 16:15.342
so we had to move her fast.
That's it.
GREGORIO: "Attempt"?

16:15.375 --> 16:17.210
What do you mean "attempt"?
Why would she be in danger?

16:19.312 --> 16:21.648
Emily's WitSec.

16:21.681 --> 16:23.283
Isn't she?

16:25.385 --> 16:27.154
You're part of her
protection detail.

16:27.187 --> 16:28.355
That's why you're
set up here,

16:28.388 --> 16:29.456
so you can keep
an eye on her.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.657
Oh, well,
that makes sense.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.192
Emily Birch isn't her real name.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.393
It's the name
WitSec gave her, huh?

16:33.426 --> 16:34.561
Which is why we couldn't
find any record

16:34.594 --> 16:37.097
of her existing
before this year.

16:37.130 --> 16:38.631
Her real identity was erased.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.200
All right, congratulations.

16:40.233 --> 16:41.368
You figured it out.
Now, do you mind?

16:41.401 --> 16:42.569
No, we're not
going anywhere

16:42.602 --> 16:44.404
until you tell us
who's after Emily

16:44.437 --> 16:46.273
because whoever it
is is undoubtedly

16:46.306 --> 16:47.740
responsible for attacking
our sailor.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.309
MALE MARSHAL:
Trust me.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.744
Your sailor doesn't matter
nearly as much as Emily.

16:51.778 --> 16:53.213
He matters to me.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.481
SAWYER: All right,
with all due respect,

16:54.514 --> 16:57.617
our only job is
to keep Emily safe

16:57.650 --> 16:59.486
until she testifies
against somebody

16:59.519 --> 17:01.554
DOJ has been trying
to bring down for years.

17:01.588 --> 17:03.256
Who?
We can't say.

17:03.290 --> 17:04.557
(scoffs)
We can't say

17:04.591 --> 17:06.459
because we've been compromised.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.561
Somehow, the target keeps
figuring out where Emily is.

17:08.595 --> 17:10.497
How? We don't know.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.399
But all the more reason
to get Emily to court

17:12.432 --> 17:14.634
so she can bring that bastard
down once and for all,

17:14.667 --> 17:16.303
whatever it takes.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.638
(phone ringing)

17:21.541 --> 17:23.110
Danny, you okay?

17:23.143 --> 17:24.511
(gunshots)
They're shooting at us, Dwayne.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.579
They're trying to kill Emily.
Emily? What do you mean?

17:26.613 --> 17:28.448
What's happening?
Who's shooting at you?

17:28.481 --> 17:30.650
(siren wailing)

17:45.798 --> 17:48.168
*

18:01.414 --> 18:03.082
(whispers):
Pride.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.422
Cover me.

18:23.570 --> 18:25.705
(crying)
It's Emily!

18:25.738 --> 18:28.708
Emily, hey. NCIS.
I'm a federal agent.

18:28.741 --> 18:29.776
You okay?

18:29.809 --> 18:31.444
You're okay.
Listen to me.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.345
Where's Danny?

18:32.379 --> 18:35.148
(crying): He hid me
after they attacked.

18:35.182 --> 18:37.150
Then he ran off
to distract them.

18:37.184 --> 18:38.718
I think they took him.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.720
I think they took Danny!

18:40.753 --> 18:42.589
Okay...

18:54.201 --> 18:56.236
(crying): I shouldn't
have called Danny.

18:56.269 --> 18:58.271
But I was scared and I
knew that he'd be worried

18:58.305 --> 18:58.905
about what happened to me.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.473
Not your fault, Emily.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.342
But I need your help
to find him.

19:02.375 --> 19:03.710
Keep going.

19:03.743 --> 19:05.178
You called Danny.

19:05.212 --> 19:07.414
He came to your safe house.

19:07.447 --> 19:10.350
The marshals, they got really
mad, tried to get him to leave.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.620
That's when those
men showed up, too.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.355
Men who are after you?

19:15.388 --> 19:17.590
I gave your agents the best
description I could, but...

19:17.624 --> 19:20.360
they started shooting
the marshals,

19:20.393 --> 19:23.463
so Danny told me he needed to
get them away from the house,

19:23.496 --> 19:24.664
away from me.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.833
I saw them get
shot, killed.

19:26.866 --> 19:28.468
I was just copying
documents.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.370
I was just an intern.

19:30.403 --> 19:32.272
I don't even know what
I was looking at.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.840
All right, all right,
an intern where?

19:33.873 --> 19:35.275
Who were you working for?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.709
Is that who you're
testifying against?

19:36.743 --> 19:37.377
SAWYER:
Don't answer that.

19:37.410 --> 19:38.678
I told you,
it's classified.

19:38.711 --> 19:39.979
Classified?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.648
Those men killed
two of your marshals.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.882
They took
my best friend's son.

19:42.915 --> 19:45.452
I can't get him back unless
I know who the hell I'm chasing.

19:45.485 --> 19:47.654
I'm sorry, but my only job
is to get Emily to court

19:47.687 --> 19:48.955
in two days. Period.

19:48.988 --> 19:50.857
Danny risked his life
to save you.

19:50.890 --> 19:52.692
You have to help me
save him.

19:52.725 --> 19:53.826
SAWYER: Come on, we've
got another safe house.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.927
Let's go. Leave the phone.

19:54.961 --> 19:56.629
Wait. I'm not going anywhere

19:56.663 --> 19:57.830
until I know Danny's safe.

19:57.864 --> 19:58.998
Good.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.467
And I'm not testifying, either!

20:00.500 --> 20:01.301
PRIDE:
Okay, tell me

20:01.334 --> 20:02.769
who took him.
Emily, listen to me.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.737
Listen to me.
They're not gonna
hurt Daniel.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.506
They only took
him to get to you.
Listen to me.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.408
Once you testify...

20:08.441 --> 20:10.377
You really think that they're
gonna just let him go

20:10.410 --> 20:11.578
after everything
they've already done?

20:11.611 --> 20:12.945
This goes all the way up

20:12.979 --> 20:14.981
to the Office of the Attorney
General, Agent Pride.

20:15.014 --> 20:18.351
I am under strict orders
and so are you.

20:18.385 --> 20:20.687
And yes, that's a warning.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.821
Let's go, kid.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.473
What's going on, King?

20:41.741 --> 20:43.710
We're gonna find Danny,
that's what.

20:43.743 --> 20:45.044
Emily's burner.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.646
Have Sebastian
tear it apart.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.648
See if it's how
they found her.

20:48.681 --> 20:50.950
If so, maybe he can reverse
track it back to them.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.719
Do we even know
who they are yet?

20:52.752 --> 20:54.621
No. The marshals won't say.

20:54.654 --> 20:57.357
So we need to figure out
where he is fast.

20:57.390 --> 20:58.591
SEBASTIAN:
I might have something.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.792
Does the name
Donner International

20:59.826 --> 21:01.060
mean anything to anyone?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.929
Donner in Dallas?
One in the same.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.366
SONJA:
I remember this guy from ATF.

21:06.399 --> 21:07.900
Malcolm Donner.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.602
We kept trying to nail him
on chemical weapons charges.

21:09.636 --> 21:11.304
How come you didn't?

21:11.338 --> 21:14.474
'Cause every time we got close,
witnesses would disappear.

21:14.507 --> 21:15.775
SEBASTIAN: No doubt
thanks to this guy,

21:15.808 --> 21:16.843
Mateo Hyder.

21:16.876 --> 21:17.944
He's listed as a VP,

21:17.977 --> 21:19.712
but he's got
a record a mile long.

21:19.746 --> 21:20.747
Danny gave us a
few key details

21:20.780 --> 21:23.015
that helped us find a match
on facial recognition.

21:23.049 --> 21:24.651
So, that's Danny's attacker?
And no doubt,

21:24.684 --> 21:25.952
the guy who took him, too.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.755
Tell me about Donner.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.790
I'm pulling it up now.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.692
Malcolm Donner, made his fortune

21:32.725 --> 21:34.394
manufacturing weapons
for the military,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.363
but he decided
he could make even more money

21:36.396 --> 21:37.630
trafficking the weapons
internationally.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.798
LASALLE:
Then what?

21:38.831 --> 21:40.099
Escalated
to chemical weapons?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.101
SONJA: Not that ATF
was able to prove.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.103
PRIDE: But DOJ obviously
thinks they can.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.005
Thanks to whatever Emily saw
when she was working for Donner.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.740
LASALLE:
Here it is.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.677
"U.S. v. Malcolm Donner,
11 counts of trafficking,

21:50.710 --> 21:52.845
including chemical weapons sales
to Syria."

21:52.879 --> 21:56.015
Trial begins Thursday,
U.S. District Court in Dallas.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.750
Two days.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.951
Who is that, his son?

21:58.985 --> 22:00.019
Yeah, that's Carsen Donner.

22:00.052 --> 22:02.789
Apparently, they're inseparable.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.123
GREGORIO:
Listen.

22:04.156 --> 22:05.625
They're not gonna do
anything to Danny.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.560
They need him to get Emily.

22:07.594 --> 22:10.630
Marshals aren't gonna let them
get anywhere near Emily again.

22:10.663 --> 22:14.901
Which means if we don't
get... Danny...

22:16.068 --> 22:18.070
Check into traffic cameras

22:18.104 --> 22:20.507
between here and Dallas.

22:22.509 --> 22:27.914
Tap into security cameras around
Donner's work and house.

22:27.947 --> 22:30.149
Get me everything you can
on him, okay?

22:30.182 --> 22:32.852
Where are you going?

22:34.787 --> 22:36.989
Tell Loretta what happened.

22:50.069 --> 22:51.438
Loretta.

22:51.471 --> 22:54.507
Hmm. All I can say is,

22:54.541 --> 22:58.077
those people sure did a
number on these poor souls.

22:58.110 --> 23:01.914
Emily is lucky she got
out of there alive.

23:01.948 --> 23:03.550
How is she?

23:03.583 --> 23:04.884
Scared.

23:04.917 --> 23:07.153
They took her
to another safe house.

23:07.186 --> 23:10.757
Well, still,
at least she's all right.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.092
Danny will be relieved.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.863
Danny was the one who saved her.

23:16.896 --> 23:19.566
What do you mean,
Danny saved her?

23:19.599 --> 23:21.100
Loretta.
W-What happened?

23:21.133 --> 23:22.201
W-Where is he...?

23:22.234 --> 23:24.003
Emily texted Danny.

23:24.036 --> 23:25.905
He left without
telling anybody to go see her,

23:25.938 --> 23:28.875
and that's when
they a-attacked.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.810
Attacked? What are
you talking about?

23:30.843 --> 23:32.178
Is he all right, is he hurt?

23:32.211 --> 23:34.547
They took him, Loretta.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.116
And I promise you,
I swear to God...

23:37.149 --> 23:39.752
No! No, no, no, no!

23:39.786 --> 23:41.220
This can't be happening.

23:41.253 --> 23:43.890
How could you let this happen?

23:43.923 --> 23:44.891
How could you
let him do that?

23:44.924 --> 23:46.225
I didn't, I thought...

23:46.258 --> 23:48.094
You're supposed
to stop him, Dwayne.

23:48.127 --> 23:50.830
See, I told you that he was
becoming too much like you.

23:50.863 --> 23:54.901
I warned you that he might
do something stupid,

23:54.934 --> 23:57.537
try to take on the world
all by himself.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.971
Like you.

23:59.005 --> 24:01.207
I promise, I won't let anything
happen to Danny...

24:01.240 --> 24:04.577
Something's already happened,
damn it, and it's your fault!

24:04.611 --> 24:07.847
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm sorry, Dwayne.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.716
This is on you.

24:09.749 --> 24:12.752
This is all on you.

24:14.754 --> 24:16.122
And I don't care

24:16.155 --> 24:17.824
how you do it,

24:17.857 --> 24:20.159
you'd better get my son back.

24:20.192 --> 24:21.861
You hear me?

24:31.904 --> 24:33.005
(door closes)

24:38.077 --> 24:40.079
Talk to me. What do we know?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.689
What?

24:49.722 --> 24:51.791
They sent us a message, King.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.159
On Emily's burner.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.594
To us.

24:54.627 --> 24:56.328
And?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.635
MAN:
If she testifies, he dies.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.037
No. Don't listen
to them, Dwayne.

25:05.071 --> 25:06.873
Don't give them Emily.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.576
Please.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.647
You able to trace it to Donner?

25:14.681 --> 25:15.815
No.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.149
SONJA: But Emily
won't testify

25:17.183 --> 25:18.651
unless Danny's safe, right?

25:18.685 --> 25:19.986
That's what she said.

25:26.659 --> 25:27.927
What are we gonna do, Pride?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.535
You're not gonna do anything.

25:42.074 --> 25:43.309
King.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.716
What are you thinking?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.250
I'm getting Danny back.

25:51.283 --> 25:52.919
Well, hold on,
we're going with you.

25:52.952 --> 25:54.320
No!

26:00.760 --> 26:02.995
LAWYER:
I'm telling you, Mr. Donner,

26:03.029 --> 26:05.932
if she does testify,
we have no defense.

26:05.965 --> 26:08.067
Do you understand me?
And prison's...
(scoffs)

26:08.100 --> 26:09.936
...not the only thing you'll
need to worry about, either.

26:09.969 --> 26:11.771
(laughs)
The entire company's
going down, too.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.773
Will you...
CARSEN:
Hey!

26:13.806 --> 26:16.108
If Dad says, "Don't worry about
it," don't worry about it.

26:16.142 --> 26:18.077
Thank you, son. See? He knows
what he's talking about.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.747
(phone beeps)
What?

26:20.780 --> 26:22.148
What's the matter?

26:22.181 --> 26:23.983
It's my Maserati.

26:24.016 --> 26:25.985
I've got an app that tells me

26:26.018 --> 26:27.954
when the valets move it
more than 500 feet.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.155
It's unbelievable.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.990
(chuckles softly)

26:35.294 --> 26:37.363
What the hell?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.076
You Carsen Donner?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.712
Yeah.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.980
Who the hell are you?

26:54.013 --> 26:56.082
Where's Danny Malloy?

27:08.928 --> 27:11.163
Where is he?

27:11.197 --> 27:12.231
Where's Danny?

27:12.264 --> 27:13.365
Where is he?

27:13.399 --> 27:15.034
What did you do to him?

27:15.067 --> 27:16.368
What the hell is...

27:40.159 --> 27:42.461
(coughing, screaming)

27:42.494 --> 27:44.697
I'm awake, I'm awake!

27:44.731 --> 27:47.066
(panting, coughing)

27:51.203 --> 27:53.706
(laughing):
Oh...

27:53.740 --> 27:56.142
Oh, my dad's gonna
kill you for this.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.711
Then I don't have anything
to lose, do I?

27:58.745 --> 28:00.312
Last chance.

28:00.346 --> 28:02.014
Where's Danny?

28:02.048 --> 28:04.383
You really think that this
is gonna save that friend?

28:04.416 --> 28:06.185
That bitch intern?

28:06.218 --> 28:10.489
It better, or you're a dead man.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.024
You're bluffing.

28:12.058 --> 28:13.993
You're what,
some kind of cop, right?

28:14.026 --> 28:15.995
You can threaten me
all you like,

28:16.028 --> 28:17.496
but you can't hurt me.

28:17.529 --> 28:19.732
They'd crucify you! Ow!

28:19.766 --> 28:21.500
But I'd still be alive.

28:21.533 --> 28:25.204
(shouts, screams)

28:25.237 --> 28:28.040
I'll do anything to save
Danny, you understand me?

28:28.074 --> 28:29.942
(crying)

28:32.478 --> 28:36.415
Danny dies, you die.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.025
(phone beeps)

28:46.058 --> 28:50.329
Please, Dad...

28:50.362 --> 28:51.463
(crying continues)

28:57.837 --> 28:59.438
What are you doing?
What's going on?

28:59.471 --> 29:00.840
Busted.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.374
We can explain.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.043
Well, you'd better,
because I'm not in the mood.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.978
Listen, Doc, we know
you're upset. We get it.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.980
But we're not just trying
to find Danny now.

29:08.014 --> 29:09.816
Yeah, we're trying
to find Pride, too.

29:09.849 --> 29:11.217
Why? What happened?

29:11.250 --> 29:12.518
He left, last night, on his own.

29:12.551 --> 29:13.986
Went looking for Danny;
we don't know how or where.

29:14.020 --> 29:15.955
He didn't take his car.

29:15.988 --> 29:18.457
So now, we're not only
trying to save Danny,

29:18.490 --> 29:20.993
we're trying
to save Dwayne, too?

29:22.228 --> 29:23.830
Must've been too hard on him.

29:23.863 --> 29:24.730
GREGORIO:
Hey, no.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.498
Your son went missing.
You had every right.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.801
It's just, now...

29:28.835 --> 29:30.536
How can I help?

29:31.503 --> 29:32.805
Well, actually,

29:32.839 --> 29:34.140
we might've already
found something.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.875
We keep racking our brains
trying to figure out

29:35.908 --> 29:37.543
how Donner keeps finding Emily.

29:37.576 --> 29:38.878
Hoping maybe we could
backtrack it to Donner,

29:38.911 --> 29:40.479
prove that he's behind it all.

29:40.512 --> 29:42.548
And get to Danny
before Dwayne goes too far.

29:42.581 --> 29:44.917
Frankly, yeah.

29:46.352 --> 29:49.221
Your autopsy
says that this is a rash,

29:49.255 --> 29:51.858
but I-I don't think that
that's biological.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.193
Did you find anything
on the shirt collar?
Yeah, maybe.

29:54.226 --> 29:56.062
Come check it out.
We're thinking that
whatever's on their skin

29:56.095 --> 29:57.897
got transferred
from their shirts.

29:57.930 --> 30:01.267
I know the military's been
working on chemical trackers.

30:01.300 --> 30:02.869
And Donner's
all about chemicals.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.237
Yeah. Look at that. Some
kind of metallic isotope.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.106
What do you use
metallic isotopes for?

30:07.139 --> 30:10.076
All kinds of things.
Geochemical tracers, bar codes.

30:10.109 --> 30:11.377
Tracking.

30:11.410 --> 30:13.379
Yeah, it must've gotten
into his shirt

30:13.412 --> 30:15.414
from some kind
of dry cleaning solvent.

30:15.447 --> 30:16.883
GREGORIO: And Donner
can easily figure out

30:16.916 --> 30:18.550
where the marshals get
their dry cleaning done.

30:18.584 --> 30:21.954
Well, if so, then he's been
tracking Emily's marshals,

30:21.988 --> 30:23.422
not Emily.

30:23.455 --> 30:24.891
GREGORIO: Question is,
how do we prove it,

30:24.924 --> 30:26.292
get Danny back before Pride

30:26.325 --> 30:28.194
does something he'll regret?

30:28.227 --> 30:30.262
SONJA:
It's too late.

30:30.296 --> 30:33.299
Pride took Donner's son.
It's the only explanation.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.566
Wait, what? That's crazy.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.635
Well, think about it,
if you were Pride,

30:36.668 --> 30:38.637
and you were gonna do everything
you can to save Danny,

30:38.670 --> 30:40.272
you'd need leverage,
serious leverage.

30:40.306 --> 30:42.374
And since there's no sign
of Pride in New Orleans,

30:42.408 --> 30:43.943
it makes sense
he'd go to Dallas.

30:43.976 --> 30:45.878
To kidnap Carsen Donner?
Come on.

30:45.912 --> 30:48.514
Well, Malcolm Donner
called the Dallas police,

30:48.547 --> 30:50.516
claimed his son
was taken. Car, too.

30:50.549 --> 30:51.650
Now, that can't be
a coincidence.

30:51.683 --> 30:53.285
It has to be Pride.

30:53.319 --> 30:55.321
And the timing works out
right, too.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.889
I mean, it takes eight hours
to drive to Dallas,

30:56.923 --> 30:58.657
and based on what time
Pride left...

30:58.690 --> 31:00.359
Holy crap.
So, what do we do?

31:00.392 --> 31:01.961
Well, we got to find him, right?
Before it's too late?

31:01.994 --> 31:03.362
SONJA: Yeah, well,
good luck with that.

31:03.395 --> 31:04.964
I mean, we're still checking
rental car companies,

31:04.997 --> 31:06.899
but if Pride doesn't want
to be found, he won't be.

31:06.933 --> 31:08.234
Yeah, he's doing
everything he can

31:08.267 --> 31:10.002
to keep us in the
clear, protect us.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.670
Okay, but we still
have to stop him.

31:11.703 --> 31:13.405
Open to suggestions.

31:13.439 --> 31:15.007
All right, Sebastian?

31:15.041 --> 31:16.976
Keep trying to backtrack
that dry cleaning deal.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.644
Gregorio, call Marshal Sawyer,

31:18.677 --> 31:20.479
tell them to get rid
of all their shirts

31:20.512 --> 31:21.981
in case they're being tracked.

31:22.014 --> 31:23.916
Percy, you and I'll keep
looking for Pride.

31:23.950 --> 31:26.953
All right, come on,
let's learn things, fast.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.024
Everybody's working on it,
Mr. Donner,

31:32.058 --> 31:33.525
but so far...

31:33.559 --> 31:35.027
nothing.
And the blood

31:35.061 --> 31:36.495
in the trunk?

31:36.528 --> 31:38.030
It's Carsen's, sir.

31:40.699 --> 31:42.935
(glass shatters)
24 hours,

31:42.969 --> 31:44.336
and you still
can't find my son?!

31:44.370 --> 31:45.972
Or who the hell
kidnapped him?

31:46.005 --> 31:47.406
It's got to be
some kind of a play.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.640
It's got to be about the trial.

31:48.674 --> 31:52.111
Yeah, well, who the hell
is behind this, then?

31:52.144 --> 31:53.946
Huh? Where's their
list of demands?

31:53.980 --> 31:55.114
What do they want?!

31:55.147 --> 31:57.349
(doorbell rings)

32:06.625 --> 32:07.994
Help you?

32:08.027 --> 32:10.129
I want to speak
to Malcolm Donner.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.031
And you are?

32:12.064 --> 32:15.234
The man who took his son.

32:23.709 --> 32:25.677
You got balls, pal.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.047
Let me ask you
one thing, though.

32:28.080 --> 32:31.117
What makes you think
you're gonna leave here alive?

32:31.150 --> 32:32.951
Your son's life depends on it.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.270
*

33:04.116 --> 33:07.486
Maybe your father doesn't
love you as much as I'd hoped.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.688
(muffled shout)

33:12.591 --> 33:14.593
*

33:42.088 --> 33:43.122
(grunts)

33:43.155 --> 33:45.757
PRIDE: When I say so,
you're gonna keep walking.

33:45.791 --> 33:47.126
Do not stop.

33:47.159 --> 33:49.728
(tape rips)

33:49.761 --> 33:54.066
Just out of curiosity, what's
this kid mean to you anyway?

33:54.100 --> 33:56.135
You wouldn't understand.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.374
Now move.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.479
Just so you know,

34:07.513 --> 34:09.481
this trial's over,
you're all dead.

34:09.515 --> 34:12.151
Kid, the intern,

34:12.184 --> 34:14.253
you.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.256
You have no idea.

34:17.289 --> 34:20.492
*

34:25.831 --> 34:27.799
(huffs)

34:28.834 --> 34:31.069
(panting)

34:34.340 --> 34:35.807
(whispers):
I'm sorry.

34:35.841 --> 34:39.111
Forget about it.

34:39.145 --> 34:40.846
You're safe now.
Yeah, it's all right.

34:40.879 --> 34:42.281
That's all that matters.

34:43.782 --> 34:45.551
I knew you'd find me, Dad.

34:46.618 --> 34:48.620
Get in the car.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.627
Come on, let's get you
out of here.

34:57.663 --> 34:59.765
(whispers):
Easy. Okay.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.473
*

35:18.750 --> 35:20.386
Might have something.

35:20.419 --> 35:22.154
Truck rental in Broadmoor.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.856
Three pickup rentals around
the time that Pride disappeared,

35:24.890 --> 35:27.226
only one hasn't been
returned yet-- cash rental.

35:27.259 --> 35:28.760
Dark blue. Here's the VIN.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.862
All right, I'll hack the GPS,
see if I can find it.

35:30.896 --> 35:33.232
Yeah, go, hurry.
Good job, Percy.
Yeah.

35:33.265 --> 35:35.534
Hold up. Pride's on his way
back to New Orleans.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.769
How do you know?
I just got off the phone
with Marshal Sawyer.

35:37.803 --> 35:39.538
Said Pride's bringing Danny
back to the safe house

35:39.571 --> 35:41.407
so he can see Emily,
so she'll testify.

35:41.440 --> 35:42.641
He got Danny back?

35:42.674 --> 35:44.176
Must've traded Carsen
to do it.

35:44.210 --> 35:45.777
Emily's flight to Dallas
leaves at 5:00.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.247
Sawyer said Pride might be able
to make it in time.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.648
Okay, so, what?
So that's it, then?

35:49.681 --> 35:51.917
We're all good?

35:51.950 --> 35:52.951
Hey, what's the matter?

35:52.984 --> 35:54.353
I don't know.

35:54.386 --> 35:56.422
I mean, something
just doesn't add up.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.923
No disrespect to Pride,

35:57.956 --> 35:59.891
but Malcolm Donner
doesn't strike me as a guy

35:59.925 --> 36:01.227
to make a trade like that,

36:01.260 --> 36:02.894
lose everything
he's got.

36:02.928 --> 36:04.696
Unless he actually thought
Pride was gonna hurt his son.

36:04.730 --> 36:05.931
I mean, still,
the man's desperate,

36:05.964 --> 36:08.867
proven to do anything he can
to keep Emily from testifying:

36:08.900 --> 36:11.237
kill her roommate,
kidnap Danny...

36:11.270 --> 36:12.804
Track and kill those marshals.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.243
What if Donner
let Pride get Danny back?

36:17.276 --> 36:18.377
Why would he let him?

36:19.478 --> 36:20.879
So he could track him.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.381
SONJA:
If so,

36:22.414 --> 36:25.217
Pride has no idea
he's leading Donner right to...

36:25.251 --> 36:26.385
Emily.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.897
Why'd you stop?

36:38.930 --> 36:42.268
Isn't the safe house
up there?

36:42.301 --> 36:44.236
PRIDE:
Yeah.

36:46.338 --> 36:48.540
Something wrong?

36:48.574 --> 36:51.543
You've been pretty quiet
on the car ride over here.

36:51.577 --> 36:52.944
Are you mad at me?

36:52.978 --> 36:54.813
Huh?

36:54.846 --> 36:57.816
No, no.
No, I'm not mad at you.

36:57.849 --> 37:00.286
No, just...

37:00.319 --> 37:04.523
All I could think about, all
I wanted was to get you back.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.526
Yeah, well, thank God you did.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.563
I didn't think about
anything else.

37:14.666 --> 37:18.970
Blocked everything
and everyone out.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.939
Think they've been
following us or something?

37:20.972 --> 37:22.808
I mean, you've been checking
the whole time.

37:22.841 --> 37:25.644
Did you tell Donner...

37:25.677 --> 37:27.346
you were gonna
see Emily afterwards?

37:27.379 --> 37:29.915
I think so.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.651
Oh...

37:32.684 --> 37:34.353
I screwed up.

37:35.754 --> 37:38.390
(rapid gunfire)

37:38.424 --> 37:40.426
Get out! Stay down, Danny!

38:03.014 --> 38:04.683
(siren wailing)

38:08.454 --> 38:09.688
(siren wailing)

38:21.099 --> 38:22.968
PRIDE:
You all right?

38:23.001 --> 38:24.903
Huh? You okay?
Mm-hmm.
I'm all right.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.943
Everything all right?

38:31.977 --> 38:33.545
All clear.

38:34.546 --> 38:36.582
Anyone hurt?
No, we're good.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.750
We're... we're
all good, thanks.

38:38.784 --> 38:41.387
You saved our butts.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.457
Emily!

38:49.561 --> 38:51.630
Danny!
It's okay.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.399
It's okay now.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.000
You did it, King.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.569
You better hurry, son.
You got two minutes.

38:57.603 --> 39:00.539
She's got a
plane to catch.

39:00.572 --> 39:02.574
I don't know how
you did it,

39:02.608 --> 39:04.376
but you did it.

39:04.410 --> 39:06.878
SAWYER: Come on, let's go.
EMILY: I love you.

39:06.912 --> 39:09.047
No, I didn't.

39:09.080 --> 39:11.817
I almost got him killed.

39:22.594 --> 39:24.596
(piano playing gentle melody)

39:36.107 --> 39:38.109
*

39:52.491 --> 39:55.060
I figured I'd find you here.

39:58.897 --> 40:00.932
Yeah. Well, I was just...

40:00.966 --> 40:04.169
trying to do everything I could
to avoid you is all.

40:04.202 --> 40:07.839
I just... obviously
failed miserably.

40:07.873 --> 40:10.075
You think I'm still mad at you,
do you?

40:10.108 --> 40:11.510
Aren't you?

40:11.543 --> 40:15.514
Well, I, I was.

40:15.547 --> 40:18.617
I must've been the maddest
I've ever been, I admit.

40:18.650 --> 40:20.185
I know, I saw.

40:22.053 --> 40:24.022
Look, Loretta,

40:24.055 --> 40:26.091
I'm sorry.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.993
You saved Danny, Dwayne.

40:28.026 --> 40:31.029
Honestly, I don't think
anyone else could have.

40:31.062 --> 40:32.097
So don't be sorry.

40:32.130 --> 40:34.032
But because of me,

40:34.065 --> 40:36.034
Danny ran off hotheaded,

40:36.067 --> 40:38.937
tried to do it
all by himself.

40:38.970 --> 40:40.171
Just like you said.

40:40.205 --> 40:41.773
You were right.
Yeah, but...

40:41.807 --> 40:43.609
Loretta, you know
as well as I do

40:43.642 --> 40:45.076
that just because
it all worked out,

40:45.110 --> 40:48.213
doesn't mean
that everything's okay.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.887
You're a good man, Dwayne,

40:55.921 --> 40:57.789
and a good father,

40:57.823 --> 40:59.958
and Danny's lucky
to have you in his life.

40:59.991 --> 41:03.261
And you should never
minimize that.

41:03.294 --> 41:05.564
Plus,

41:05.597 --> 41:07.132
because of who you are,
that Donner,

41:07.165 --> 41:08.734
he's in jail now.

41:08.767 --> 41:10.502
And that's a good thing.

41:10.536 --> 41:12.270
I know.

41:12.303 --> 41:14.773
I know it is.
I just...

41:14.806 --> 41:17.609
You don't...

41:18.877 --> 41:22.247
I lost myself again...

41:22.280 --> 41:24.883
Loretta, in-in my...

41:28.554 --> 41:31.256
...doing whatever it is
I think I have to do

41:31.289 --> 41:33.759
to make things right.

41:33.792 --> 41:37.195
Like I did with Hamilton;
with the others.

41:37.228 --> 41:39.831
I just...

41:39.865 --> 41:41.967
I just don't know why.

41:46.605 --> 41:49.708
So, what you gonna
do about it?

42:12.798 --> 42:14.232
I'm actually glad
you called me

42:14.265 --> 42:16.968
before I called
you, Agent Pride.

42:19.104 --> 42:22.941
Frankly, after what just
happened, HQ's... concerned.

42:22.974 --> 42:24.876
Yeah?

42:24.910 --> 42:27.178
Yeah.

42:29.147 --> 42:30.816
So am I.
