WEBVTT

00:00.428 --> 00:02.125
Only on Fox.

00:06.869 --> 00:09.698
[playing fanfare on kazoo]

00:11.395 --> 00:14.572
You are cordially invited
to Dudley's Thanksgiving.

00:14.616 --> 00:16.095
It's a hot ticket.

00:16.139 --> 00:17.619
Very exclusive.

00:17.662 --> 00:19.360
Please come.

00:19.403 --> 00:21.927
Get out of here, Dudley.
We already have plans.

00:21.971 --> 00:23.407
Well, let me know
if anything changes.

00:23.451 --> 00:25.670
[plays fanfare]

00:25.714 --> 00:28.020
[laughs]:
Well...

00:28.064 --> 00:30.588
what areyou guys doing
for Thanksgiving?

00:30.632 --> 00:32.721
Well, I think the question
you should be asking is:

00:32.764 --> 00:34.505
what are wedoing
for Thanksgiving?

00:34.549 --> 00:38.030
Yes, Margaret, since tomorrow
is your very first Thanksgiving

00:38.074 --> 00:39.728
here at Shady Meadows,

00:39.771 --> 00:42.296
I would like to issue
a formal invitation

00:42.339 --> 00:46.604
for you to have dinner with us
at the renowned Tucson hot spot

00:46.648 --> 00:48.693
Chez Sid!

00:50.173 --> 00:51.827
Margaret, you're
really gonna enjoy it.

00:51.870 --> 00:53.655
Sid makes all the classics.

00:53.698 --> 00:56.658
Yam casserole.
Green bean casserole.

00:56.701 --> 00:58.355
Stuffing casserole.

00:58.399 --> 01:01.097
And of course,
his fabled casserole casserole.

01:01.140 --> 01:04.535
Oh, well, thank you
for the invitation, you guys.

01:04.579 --> 01:08.104
As delicious as a four-casserole
Thanksgiving sounds...

01:08.147 --> 01:10.411
Uh-bup-bup,
there's 12 casseroles, Margaret.

01:10.454 --> 01:12.413
We were just giving you
the highlights.

01:12.456 --> 01:15.285
[laughing]: Yeah. We didn't
want to blow your mind.

01:15.329 --> 01:16.765
Well, I appreciate that.

01:16.808 --> 01:19.158
But I-I actually
already have plans.

01:19.202 --> 01:21.683
With who? Dudley's
the only other game in town,

01:21.726 --> 01:24.729
and that is too dark
to even think about.

01:24.773 --> 01:28.342
Well, he's not
the onlyother game in town.

01:28.385 --> 01:29.691
Well, who else?

01:29.734 --> 01:31.170
Oh, wait a minute,

01:31.214 --> 01:33.477
not Murray and the food snobs!

01:33.521 --> 01:35.784
Well, now,
I've already dry-brined

01:35.827 --> 01:38.177
and spatchcocked the turkey,

01:38.221 --> 01:40.397
which will,
of course, be divine.

01:40.441 --> 01:44.096
Francine, love your
ciabatta and sausage stuffing.

01:44.140 --> 01:47.012
But, uh, go easy
on the sage this year.

01:47.056 --> 01:49.450
This isn't a Wiccan festival.

01:49.493 --> 01:51.321
FRANCINE:
Note taken, Murray.

01:51.365 --> 01:55.586
And I apologize if I've
let you down in the past.

01:57.501 --> 01:58.807
And, Norman,

01:58.850 --> 02:02.158
if you bring another
of your oak-y Chardonnays,

02:02.201 --> 02:03.986
you'll be banished
to the cafeteria

02:04.029 --> 02:06.380
along with the rest
of these mouth-breathers.

02:07.816 --> 02:10.732
You know, I actually prefer
breathing through my mouth.

02:10.775 --> 02:12.908
It's so much easier.
It's just...

02:12.951 --> 02:14.692
[takes deep breath]

02:14.736 --> 02:17.826
Yeah. That's so nice.

02:17.869 --> 02:20.481
And how'd you score
an invite, anyway?

02:20.524 --> 02:22.221
They hate everyone.
Even me.

02:22.265 --> 02:24.485
Can you wrap your head
around that?

02:24.528 --> 02:27.009
Murray just came up to me
and invited me, and I,

02:27.052 --> 02:28.837
I don't mind, he's kind of cute.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.491
And that British accent.

02:30.534 --> 02:32.057
Cheerio.

02:33.450 --> 02:36.497
Well, all that food sounds wack.

02:36.540 --> 02:40.109
I didn't hear the word
"casserole" in there once.

02:41.632 --> 02:43.286
Margaret, let me
explain something to you.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.202
We forbid you from going
over there for Thanksgiving!

02:47.464 --> 02:48.726
You know, Thanksgiving is a time

02:48.770 --> 02:50.728
to be with the people
you care about.

02:50.772 --> 02:53.514
That's why we all told our kids
that we have the flu.

02:53.557 --> 02:56.778
-So we could hang out here
and party.
-SID: Mm-hmm.

02:56.821 --> 03:00.956
Exactly. Nothing should come
between us on Thanksgiving Day.

03:00.999 --> 03:03.437
Murray gave me a plus-one.

03:03.480 --> 03:05.526
-Me! Me, me, me!
-Oh, no.
-Margaret!

03:05.569 --> 03:08.790
-[shouting]
-Me, me, me, me, me...
-Margaret! Margaret.

03:08.833 --> 03:10.835
â™ª

03:30.855 --> 03:34.206
Okay, I, uh,
think the choice is obvious.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.600
You can't spell Thanksgiving
without "Hank." That's me.

03:36.644 --> 03:38.994
I'm Hank, so...

03:39.037 --> 03:42.476
Oh. I was gonna pitch myself,
but that was so convincing.

03:42.519 --> 03:45.043
I think you should take Hank.

03:45.087 --> 03:48.656
Margaret!
Please, please pick me.

03:48.699 --> 03:52.050
This little kitty wants
a fancy feast.

03:53.487 --> 03:56.054
Sid. You're preparing
your own Thanksgiving.

03:56.098 --> 03:58.013
You can't go to somebody else's.

03:58.056 --> 03:59.623
Watch me.
Margaret, please pick me.

03:59.667 --> 04:02.670
You know that I am
the classiest of the three.

04:02.713 --> 04:04.106
Well...

04:04.149 --> 04:06.848
the bar is a little low.

04:09.633 --> 04:11.026
But yeah, I-I pick Sid.

04:11.069 --> 04:12.506
[laughs]:
Hurray! Hurray!

04:12.549 --> 04:16.335
I told you I was the classiest.
[blowing raspberries]

04:16.379 --> 04:18.468
But what are we supposed
to do now? You're preparing

04:18.512 --> 04:19.687
-our Thanksgiving!
-CHARLIE: Yeah.

04:19.730 --> 04:21.602
Well, you can cook it.

04:21.645 --> 04:23.691
Everything's in my apartment.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.388
Happy Thanksgiving, guys.

04:25.432 --> 04:28.870
Come on, girl,
we are moving on up.

04:28.913 --> 04:32.569
[playing fanfare on kazoo]

04:32.613 --> 04:35.659
Plans fall through?
That's my target audience.

04:37.574 --> 04:39.010
I got more.

04:43.928 --> 04:46.061
Ooh... I'm so excited.

04:46.104 --> 04:48.629
And hungry.

04:48.672 --> 04:50.892
I didn't eat all day
in anticipation.

04:50.935 --> 04:53.198
Same. I even did an hour
on the elliptical

04:53.242 --> 04:55.636
just to work up an appetite.

04:55.679 --> 04:57.725
All right, a half hour.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.988
Fine. I went in the sauna.

05:00.031 --> 05:01.555
There it is.

05:03.034 --> 05:05.341
Okay, Sid, I'm kind of
interested in Murray,

05:05.384 --> 05:07.735
so try to make me
look good in there.

05:07.778 --> 05:09.301
But they are so ritzy.

05:09.345 --> 05:11.565
Growing up in small-town Texas,

05:11.608 --> 05:13.654
we didn't do fancy holidays.

05:13.697 --> 05:15.699
One Christmas,
we ate a squirrel family

05:15.743 --> 05:18.136
that was nesting in the attic.

05:22.793 --> 05:25.404
Okay, that is horrifying.

05:26.623 --> 05:28.451
Gee, Sid, I would've thought

05:28.495 --> 05:31.715
that your palate would be
a little more refined.

05:31.759 --> 05:33.935
Because I'm gay, Margaret?

05:33.978 --> 05:35.806
Wow.

05:35.850 --> 05:37.373
Well, I didn't mean

05:37.416 --> 05:38.766
-just because you're...
-Oh...

05:38.809 --> 05:41.682
what an ugly moment.

05:42.813 --> 05:44.554
Margaret, gay people

05:44.598 --> 05:47.644
can be trash, too, you know.

05:47.688 --> 05:50.560
Okay, fine. From now on I will
recognize that you are trash.

05:50.604 --> 05:53.694
Well, thank you.

05:53.737 --> 05:55.913
In the meantime,
will you try to fit in here?

05:55.957 --> 05:57.654
We're gonna have
the best meal of our lives.

05:59.003 --> 06:01.005
Hi, y'all!

06:02.224 --> 06:03.965
I brought a bottle of wine

06:04.008 --> 06:05.793
for our dashing host.

06:05.836 --> 06:07.621
It's from France.

06:07.664 --> 06:10.232
Ooh. Did you hear that,
everyone?

06:10.275 --> 06:13.061
France.

06:13.104 --> 06:16.630
Oh, please. Meet my roommate,
Woof-Gang Puck.

06:16.673 --> 06:18.153
Evergreen, Murray.

06:18.196 --> 06:20.416
I love it more
every time I hear it.

06:21.678 --> 06:23.680
Well, I wouldn't mind
woof-ing down

06:23.724 --> 06:26.074
-some of these appetizers.
-Bup-bup-bup-bup,

06:26.117 --> 06:27.858
my appetizer-sized friend.

06:27.902 --> 06:29.468
All in due time.

06:29.512 --> 06:31.470
Around here, we like
to tantalize the mind

06:31.514 --> 06:33.342
as well as the palate.

06:34.473 --> 06:35.562
What?

06:37.302 --> 06:40.741
-Whew, that was exhausting.
-CHARLIE: Oh, yes, sir.

06:40.784 --> 06:44.745
I'd feel a lot better about it
if we'd made something edible.

06:44.788 --> 06:47.835
Yeah, well, I think the problem
here is neither one of us

06:47.878 --> 06:49.488
knows how to cook.

06:51.447 --> 06:53.101
-Amen, brother.
-Hey.

06:53.144 --> 06:56.757
[grunts] But, you know, Margaret
and Sid are coming right back.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.802
-They are?
-Oh, yeah.

06:58.846 --> 07:01.065
As soon as they walk into
Murray's, realize they're wrong,

07:01.109 --> 07:02.893
they're gonna come rushing back,

07:02.937 --> 07:06.897
begging to cook us the
Thanksgiving meal of our dreams.

07:06.941 --> 07:09.726
Well, that is good, because it
would be a very sad Thanksgiving

07:09.770 --> 07:13.687
if it was just the two of us
in Sid's apartment with no food.

07:13.730 --> 07:15.471
[chuckles]

07:15.514 --> 07:17.516
[quietly]:
Yes, indeed.

07:19.736 --> 07:22.565
But no, they're coming back now.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.699
They're coming right back
through that door.

07:25.742 --> 07:28.136
So they're coming back

07:28.179 --> 07:30.268
right...

07:30.312 --> 07:31.574
now!

07:32.880 --> 07:35.143
Right now!

07:36.840 --> 07:38.233
It's not working, Hank.

07:38.276 --> 07:39.887
No, they're coming back.

07:39.930 --> 07:41.540
They're coming back.

07:41.584 --> 07:42.933
-Yeah, say this with me.
-Okay.

07:42.977 --> 07:44.805
Five, four, three, two, one.

07:44.848 --> 07:45.675
BOTH:
Now!

07:45.719 --> 07:46.937
Now!

07:48.156 --> 07:49.548
Now!

07:51.725 --> 07:54.815
Every year before dinner,
we play trivia.

07:54.858 --> 07:58.035
Get a question right,
earn an appetizer.

07:58.079 --> 08:01.778
[laughs]: Oh. I love learning
when I'm hungry.

08:01.822 --> 08:03.911
You love trivia, right, Sid?

08:03.954 --> 08:05.303
Oh, 'deed I do.

08:05.347 --> 08:07.262
'Deed I do.

08:07.305 --> 08:09.960
'Deed I don't.
Margaret, I don't know anything.

08:10.004 --> 08:12.354
Well, just roll with it,
because these appetizers

08:12.397 --> 08:15.400
smell freakin' amazing.

08:15.444 --> 08:17.794
MURRAY:
First question!

08:17.838 --> 08:19.100
Francine.

08:19.143 --> 08:21.885
What varietals make up
a Bordeaux blend?

08:21.929 --> 08:25.193
Getting a little
"Bordeaux" myself.

08:25.236 --> 08:28.762
Starting with a softball,
eh, Murray?

08:28.805 --> 08:30.198
Very well.

08:30.241 --> 08:32.853
The answer is:
Cabernet Sauvignon,

08:32.896 --> 08:34.724
Merlot and Cabernet Franc.

08:34.768 --> 08:36.378
Correct!
[chuckles]

08:36.421 --> 08:39.642
This deviled quail's egg
is yours.

08:39.686 --> 08:40.817
Mm. Mm.

08:43.341 --> 08:44.908
Mmm!

08:46.127 --> 08:47.911
Mmm!

08:48.912 --> 08:50.435
Mmm!

08:53.482 --> 08:54.483
Mmm!

08:56.398 --> 08:59.444
Oh. Mmm! Mmm!

08:59.488 --> 09:02.186
[panting]:
Oh, my God.

09:02.230 --> 09:03.971
Oh!

09:04.014 --> 09:05.755
[pants]

09:05.799 --> 09:07.844
Oh, God, I love trivia.

09:10.455 --> 09:13.241
That really made me upset.

09:14.808 --> 09:17.549
There's a weird energy
in here, right?

09:17.593 --> 09:19.769
Big-time.
But I am definitely staying

09:19.813 --> 09:22.946
until I get one of those eggs.

09:26.384 --> 09:27.995
[weakly]:
Now.

09:29.823 --> 09:31.041
Now.

09:35.872 --> 09:37.352
You know, Hank,
I'm starting to think

09:37.395 --> 09:39.876
-they're not coming back.
-Well, damn it, Charlie,

09:39.920 --> 09:41.922
-the four of us
are supposed to be a team.
-I know.

09:41.965 --> 09:44.272
Now we got no place to eat
Thanksgiving dinner.

09:44.315 --> 09:46.100
Well...

09:47.188 --> 09:48.972
Ah!

09:50.278 --> 09:52.889
The natives have arrived
on Dudley Rock.

09:52.933 --> 09:54.978
I bid thee welcome.

09:56.066 --> 09:57.502
[Charlie groans]

10:06.424 --> 10:08.905
All right, you guys are up.

10:08.949 --> 10:11.516
Mm, perhaps one of you will
finally get a question right.

10:11.560 --> 10:13.823
God, I hope so.
I'm getting lightheaded.

10:13.867 --> 10:16.826
Do you think we could get
an appetizer on loan?

10:16.870 --> 10:18.480
[chuckles]
Nope.

10:18.523 --> 10:19.916
All right.
[clears throat]

10:19.960 --> 10:22.832
Name three hard
Italian cow's milk cheeses.

10:22.876 --> 10:25.095
Ooh, I love cheese.
I got this one.

10:28.316 --> 10:31.275
Remember, this is your
last chance to get an appetizer.

10:33.800 --> 10:37.064
Italian cheese, Sid.
Say something Italian.

10:38.369 --> 10:40.676
Ah-cheese-ah!

10:41.720 --> 10:42.852
Ah-cheese-ah...

10:42.896 --> 10:44.419
is not correct.

10:44.462 --> 10:45.986
Game over.

10:48.118 --> 10:51.905
You guys are all eating
appetizers; we're starving.

10:51.948 --> 10:53.515
Couldn't we just eat some?

10:53.558 --> 10:57.258
But, you didn't get
any questions right.

10:59.956 --> 11:01.915
Don't worry, dinner's just
around the corner.

11:01.958 --> 11:03.917
And it's gonna be incredible.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.570
[sighing]:
All right, Sid.

11:05.614 --> 11:08.008
As it turns out,
Murray kind of blows,

11:08.051 --> 11:11.098
but we've come too far
not to get that dinner.

11:11.141 --> 11:15.232
So-so what? Are you just gonna
waste those appetizers?

11:15.276 --> 11:17.887
Hmm? Oh, don't worry. They'll be
going to Woof-Gang Puck.

11:17.931 --> 11:20.542
Uh, just the rules of the game.

11:22.936 --> 11:25.068
But he didn't get
one question right.

11:25.112 --> 11:28.071
Name one.
One Italian cheese.

11:28.115 --> 11:31.727
Name one if you're such
a smart little bitch!

11:34.948 --> 11:38.081
He's more of a cat person.

11:42.738 --> 11:44.087
Where's the food, man?

11:44.131 --> 11:47.264
Well, the turkey just went
into the oven.

11:47.308 --> 11:51.573
So, our food should be ready
in a brisk four hours.

11:51.616 --> 11:54.054
Is that when everyone else
is gonna show up?

11:55.011 --> 11:57.622
Uh-huh.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.320
All right, man, whatever.

11:59.363 --> 12:01.626
Let's watch some football
until it's ready.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.281
And where the hell
is your couch?

12:04.325 --> 12:07.328
It's being reupholstered,
but, luckily,

12:07.371 --> 12:11.941
I have these backless stools.

12:11.985 --> 12:14.726
Are you kidding me?
Damn, Dudley.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.598
[chuckles] Backless stools?

12:16.641 --> 12:18.730
What is this, Venezuela?

12:18.774 --> 12:22.038
Are we ready for the big game?

12:22.082 --> 12:24.867
Well, at least we get football,
Hank. [grunts]

12:26.390 --> 12:28.827
What?

12:28.871 --> 12:30.742
Radio?

12:30.786 --> 12:32.440
That's right.
I don't own a TV.

12:32.483 --> 12:35.573
I prefer to listen to the game
and imagine the players.

12:35.617 --> 12:37.401
Well, you know what else you're
gonna be imagining?

12:37.445 --> 12:39.447
-Us being here,
'cause we're leaving.
-Oh.

12:39.490 --> 12:43.451
I don't care if Murray
didn't invite us, we're going.

12:43.494 --> 12:44.756
Oh, wait, guys.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.802
At least stay for a beer.

12:46.845 --> 12:48.325
What kind of beer?

12:48.369 --> 12:50.284
Root.

12:55.289 --> 12:58.379
I know what you're doing here.

12:58.422 --> 13:01.251
Do you? Because
I'm beginning to wonder.

13:01.295 --> 13:03.036
You like Murray.

13:03.079 --> 13:05.386
And you're wasting your time.

13:05.429 --> 13:08.998
Murray isn't interested
in women.

13:09.042 --> 13:11.696
-Mm.
-Or men.

13:13.872 --> 13:16.875
He only has eyes for food.

13:16.919 --> 13:19.095
You're mine.

13:22.098 --> 13:26.363
What is in these appetizers?

13:26.407 --> 13:28.235
[laughing] So...

13:28.278 --> 13:31.064
walk me through your
typical Thanksgiving menu

13:31.107 --> 13:34.067
one more time so I can get it
exactly right.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.156
Well, basically,
if it's in a can,

13:36.199 --> 13:37.984
it goes in a casserole.

13:39.855 --> 13:42.205
That is incredible.

13:42.249 --> 13:45.513
Murray, they dine on casseroles.

13:45.556 --> 13:47.297
Oh, I love 'em.

13:47.341 --> 13:49.473
You can put
just about anything in 'em.

13:49.517 --> 13:52.520
But you cannot skip the glue

13:52.563 --> 13:55.088
that holds it all together:
the American cheese.

13:55.131 --> 13:56.741
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.

13:58.352 --> 14:01.311
I'd rather eat a bullet
than American cheese.

14:01.355 --> 14:03.748
Oh, we all would, Francine.
We all would.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.185
But don't worry.

14:05.228 --> 14:06.229
-Tonight we dine in style.
-Mmm.

14:06.273 --> 14:08.144
-Spanakopita.
-Oh.

14:08.188 --> 14:10.407
-Lamb shanks that cascade
off the bone.
-Yes.

14:10.451 --> 14:13.106
-Bacon-filled dates flown in
from Jerusalem.
-Mmm.

14:13.149 --> 14:14.977
Okay, this all sounds
really amazing,

14:15.021 --> 14:17.414
but if this stuff is cooking,
why don't I smell it?

14:17.458 --> 14:19.329
Oh, I couldn't cook
all that here.

14:19.373 --> 14:22.158
Didn't you hear the man?
There's spanakopita...

14:22.202 --> 14:24.943
We got it, Francine!

14:24.987 --> 14:26.945
[stammers] A feast
of this size and scale

14:26.989 --> 14:29.209
could only be prepared in
a commercial kitchen.

14:29.252 --> 14:31.559
Uh, luckily, with Shady Meadows
closed for the holidays,

14:31.602 --> 14:33.126
the dining hall
was just the place.

14:33.169 --> 14:35.215
Okay, so when do I eat?

14:35.258 --> 14:37.086
Soon. Oh, very soon.

14:37.130 --> 14:39.306
-In fact, uh, we should
go check on our dishes.
-Ah.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.917
Why don't we go down now,
and you two, uh,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.006
well, stay here
and set the table. Hmm?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.226
Uh, maybe, uh, clean up a bit.

14:46.269 --> 14:49.142
The room. And yourselves.

14:52.797 --> 14:55.670
Okay, this is super weird,
right?

14:55.713 --> 14:58.151
What is going on here?

14:58.194 --> 14:59.108
I'll tell you what's going on.

14:59.152 --> 15:00.892
You are not doing

15:00.936 --> 15:02.981
your share of the chores.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.557
They've been gone
for over an hour.

15:13.601 --> 15:15.124
I am ravenous.

15:15.168 --> 15:17.692
Who locks their refrigerator?

15:17.735 --> 15:19.607
Full disclosure.

15:19.650 --> 15:23.480
I ate a pinch of fish food
a minute ago.

15:23.524 --> 15:25.134
Fuller disclosure.

15:25.178 --> 15:27.267
I almost ate the fish.

15:27.310 --> 15:30.400
Screw you, Murray, I'm staying!

15:30.444 --> 15:32.272
Well, where's Murray?

15:32.315 --> 15:34.143
What are you guys doing here?

15:34.187 --> 15:36.580
We had no other place to go.
Y'all bailed on us.

15:36.624 --> 15:38.495
And we wound up at Dudley's.

15:38.539 --> 15:40.062
-Dudley's!
-Yeah.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.411
Where the hell is everybody?

15:41.455 --> 15:43.196
Yeah, and where's the food?

15:43.239 --> 15:45.981
[scoffs] Boys,
I don't think you understand

15:46.024 --> 15:48.201
how classy parties work.

15:48.244 --> 15:52.857
You only get food if you get
the trivia questions right.

15:54.424 --> 15:58.428
If you get them wrong,
it goes to Murray's dog.

15:58.472 --> 16:00.517
So they gave your food
to the dog,

16:00.561 --> 16:02.389
and then the host
just left you here?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.347
[laughing]: Hank.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.395
You are hopelessly
working class.

16:08.438 --> 16:11.006
This is all totally normal.

16:11.049 --> 16:14.052
Once we set the table
and clean ourselves...

16:15.358 --> 16:16.664
...Murray and his friends

16:16.707 --> 16:19.014
will return
from the big turkey kitchen

16:19.057 --> 16:22.191
and we'll have a feast.

16:22.235 --> 16:25.368
Hearing it out loud,
it does sound a little off.

16:25.412 --> 16:27.327
A little off?

16:27.370 --> 16:29.198
You know what?
We need to go downstairs

16:29.242 --> 16:31.331
and find out what's going on.

16:31.374 --> 16:35.770
Charlie, do you know any hard
Italian cow's milk cheeses?

16:35.813 --> 16:39.643
Well, off the top of my head,
there's Parmesan, Romano,

16:39.687 --> 16:43.212
Asiago, uh, Grana Padano,
there's...

16:43.256 --> 16:46.346
Damn it, I picked
the wrong plus-one.

16:47.521 --> 16:49.218
Well, we pulled it off.

16:49.262 --> 16:51.002
For the first time in years,

16:51.046 --> 16:53.440
our Thanksgiving finally had
a little excitement.

16:53.483 --> 16:56.443
Can you believe they're still up
there cleaning my apartment?

16:56.486 --> 16:58.488
And they're still expecting to
have a delicious dinner.

16:58.532 --> 17:02.840
The very delicious dinner that
we're eating right now.

17:02.884 --> 17:05.234
Oh, those peasants are going
to be as bitter

17:05.278 --> 17:08.281
-as in-season radicchio.
-[Murray laughs]

17:08.324 --> 17:12.067
Why play with one's food when
you can play with people?

17:12.110 --> 17:14.112
-Huh? [chuckles]
-[Francine laughs]

17:14.156 --> 17:16.158
I knew they were food snobs,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.639
but these people
are sociopaths.

17:18.682 --> 17:22.425
It's bad that I still find him
attractive, isn't it?

17:22.469 --> 17:26.299
Uh-uh, I-I get it.

17:26.342 --> 17:29.476
Are we ever gonna eat?

17:29.519 --> 17:32.305
Did you see the bottle of wine
that woman brought?

17:32.348 --> 17:36.134
There was a price tag on
the bottom. $17.99.

17:36.178 --> 17:37.266
[all laugh]

17:37.310 --> 17:38.659
Why are they laughing?

17:38.702 --> 17:41.923
Well, is it too high or too low?

17:46.319 --> 17:49.757
Who would do something that
horrible on Thanksgiving?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.063
Yeah, I bet you're feeling
pretty crappy

17:52.107 --> 17:53.456
you ditched us for them, huh?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.284
You know what? I am.

17:55.328 --> 17:57.417
I abandoned my friends,
and for what?

17:57.460 --> 17:59.419
Food that I never even
got to eat,

17:59.462 --> 18:03.423
and the most sadistic game
of trivia I've ever played.

18:03.466 --> 18:08.079
Yeah, well, at least you didn't
lose out to a freakin' dog.

18:08.123 --> 18:10.952
I'm sorry we messed up
your Thanksgiving Day, guys.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.997
No, the day's still young.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.304
We're about to find out what
Thanksgiving is really about.

18:15.348 --> 18:18.655
Yeah. Naps.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.353
No, Charlie.

18:20.396 --> 18:22.572
Friends. Together.

18:22.616 --> 18:26.446
Exacting sweet revenge on those
douchebags who harmed 'em.

18:26.489 --> 18:27.490
Who's with me?

18:27.534 --> 18:29.971
SID/MARGARET/CHARLIE:
We are.

18:37.065 --> 18:38.458
-Here it is.
-Ah.

18:38.501 --> 18:40.547
My famous pecan soufflÃ©.

18:40.590 --> 18:42.331
Maybe we should find another
couple of rubes

18:42.375 --> 18:45.203
-and do this again next year.
-[Murray chuckles]

18:45.247 --> 18:49.730
Indeed. I haven't smiled
this much in a long time.

18:52.950 --> 18:56.780
You know, we may not need
to find other rubes.

18:56.824 --> 19:01.045
I'm not so sure we couldn't
do it again to these idiots.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.353
Oh, you mean us idiots?

19:04.397 --> 19:06.355
Yes, yes, I do.

19:06.399 --> 19:07.487
[gasps] Oh.

19:07.530 --> 19:10.751
We're busted. Ooh.

19:10.794 --> 19:13.014
Well, what are you going
to do about it?

19:13.057 --> 19:15.930
We finished dinner and we're
almost done with dessert.

19:15.973 --> 19:18.019
You're right, Francine.
You won.

19:18.062 --> 19:20.543
You are so much smarter
than we are.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.458
So much so that we would like

19:22.502 --> 19:24.199
to play a little game of trivia
with you.

19:24.242 --> 19:25.635
-What? Oh, well, very well.
-[chuckles]

19:25.679 --> 19:27.289
-Shoot.
-All right.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.595
See if you can name
all the ingredients

19:28.638 --> 19:30.510
in that soufflÃ©
that you're eating.

19:30.553 --> 19:33.034
Well, that's easy.
Butter, eggs, pecans...

19:33.077 --> 19:35.515
Ah, you forgot
the secret ingredients

19:35.558 --> 19:37.647
we slipped in there
when y'all were having dinner.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.650
Yeah, that's right.
The soufflÃ© needed

19:40.694 --> 19:43.610
some sort of glue
to hold it together.

19:43.653 --> 19:49.006
The glue known as...
American cheese.

19:49.050 --> 19:51.269
-[gasps, whimpers]
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:51.313 --> 19:52.836
[stammers] You can't be serious.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.666
MARGARET: You all are eating
pure American cheese.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.277
Zero percent dairy.

19:59.321 --> 20:01.541
Murray? What's happening?

20:01.584 --> 20:04.195
Am I poor now?

20:04.239 --> 20:07.068
You bums.
You-you bums!

20:07.111 --> 20:09.679
Oh, shut up, you Australian
son of a bitch.

20:09.723 --> 20:11.333
Yeah, that's what you get
for messing

20:11.377 --> 20:12.552
-with this crew, Murray.
-Yeah.

20:12.595 --> 20:14.510
[gagging]

20:15.903 --> 20:18.558
[laughing] Oh, revenge is sweet.

20:18.601 --> 20:20.255
[Sid sighs]

20:20.298 --> 20:23.301
Not as sweet as food, though.
We need to eat something.

20:23.345 --> 20:27.131
Well, let's go to my apartment.
I'll whip up some casseroles.

20:27.175 --> 20:28.916
Well, not an option.

20:28.959 --> 20:32.441
We, uh, we trashed the place.

20:32.485 --> 20:34.617
Well, what are we gonna do?

20:34.661 --> 20:36.793
MARGARET:
Oh, man, I was so hungry.

20:36.837 --> 20:38.839
-[laughter]
-[radio plays indistinctly]

20:38.882 --> 20:41.711
[overlapping chatter]

20:41.755 --> 20:43.713
You know, I got to tell you,
Dudley,

20:43.757 --> 20:46.673
I-I actually enjoy imagining
the players.

20:46.716 --> 20:48.675
-It's nice, isn't it?
-It is.

20:48.718 --> 20:50.546
Yeah. I-I'm sure glad
you all came over.

20:50.590 --> 20:52.722
You really turned my day around.

20:52.766 --> 20:54.811
Aw. This has been great.

20:54.855 --> 20:57.466
I can't believe I thought
Thanksgiving with Murray

20:57.510 --> 20:59.555
was gonna be better
than you guys.

20:59.599 --> 21:00.948
Nothing's better than us,
Margaret.

21:00.991 --> 21:02.689
You should know that by now.

21:02.732 --> 21:05.561
Hey, happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

21:05.605 --> 21:07.520
ALL:
Happy Thanksgiving.

21:07.563 --> 21:09.522
Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.

21:09.565 --> 21:13.177
Now can we please turn
this damn football off?

21:13.221 --> 21:15.919
-Uh-oh.
-And rock and roll!
-Whoa.

21:15.963 --> 21:19.053
â™ª Take them old potatoes
off the shelf â™ª

21:19.096 --> 21:22.143
â™ª I'm gonna bake 'em all
by myself â™ª

21:22.186 --> 21:23.753
Go, Sid.

21:23.797 --> 21:24.841
â™ª Those psycho foodies

21:24.885 --> 21:26.713
-â™ª Ain't got no soul
-Uh-huh.

21:26.756 --> 21:29.063
â™ª I want an old-time casserole

21:29.106 --> 21:33.763
-MARGARET: Yeah, Sid!
-[all laugh]

21:33.807 --> 21:35.504
MAN:
That's pretty good.
