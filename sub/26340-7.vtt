for Thanksgiving?

you should be asking is:

00:32.764 --> 00:34.505
what are wedoing
for Thanksgiving?

00:34.549 --> 00:38.030
Yes, Margaret, since tomorrow
is your very first Thanksgiving

a formal invitation

11:11.141 --> 11:15.232
So-so what? Are you just gonna
waste those appetizers?

11:15.276 --> 11:17.887
Hmm? Oh, don't worry. They'll be
going to Woof-Gang Puck.

11:17.931 --> 11:20.542
Uh, just the rules of the game.

11:22.936 --> 11:25.068
But he didn't get
one question right.

11:25.112 --> 11:28.071
Name one.
One Italian cheese.

11:28.115 --> 11:31.727
Name one if you're such
a smart little bitch!

11:34.948 --> 11:38.081
He's more of a cat person.

11:42.738 --> 11:44.087
Where's the food, man?

11:44.131 --> 11:47.264
Well, the turkey just went
into the oven.

11:47.308 --> 11:51.573
So, our food should be ready
in a brisk four hours.

11:51.616 --> 11:54.054
Is that when everyone else
is gonna show up?

11:55.011 --> 11:57.622
Uh-huh.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.320
All right, man, whatever.

11:59.363 --> 12:01.626
Let's watch some football
until it's ready.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.281
And where the hell
is your couch?

12:04.325 --> 12:07.328
It's being reupholstered,
but, luckily,

12:07.371 --> 12:11.941
I have these backless stools.

12:11.985 --> 12:14.726
Are you kidding me?
Damn, Dudley.

12:14.770 --> 12:16.598
[chuckles] Backless stools?

12:16.641 --> 12:18.730
What is this, Venezuela?

12:18.774 --> 12:22.038
Are we ready for the big game?

12:22.082 --> 12:24.867
Well, at least we get football,
Hank. [grunts]

12:26.390 --> 12:28.827
What?

12:28.871 --> 12:30.742
Radio?

12:30.786 --> 12:32.440
That's right.
I don't own a TV.

12:32.483 --> 12:35.573
I prefer to listen to the game
and imagine the players.

12:35.617 --> 12:37.401
Well, you know what else you're
gonna be imagining?

12:37.445 --> 12:39.447
-Us being here,
'cause we're leaving.
-Oh.

12:39.490 --> 12:43.451
I don't care if Murray
didn't invite us, we're going.

12:43.494 --> 12:44.756
Oh, wait, guys.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.802
At least stay for a beer.

12:46.845 --> 12:48.325
What kind of beer?

12:48.369 --> 12:50.284
Root.

12:55.289 --> 12:58.379
I know what you're doing here.

12:58.422 --> 13:01.251
Do you? Because
I'm beginning to wonder.

13:01.295 --> 13:03.036
You like Murray.

13:03.079 --> 13:05.386
And you're wasting your time.

13:05.429 --> 13:08.998
Murray isn't interested
in women.

13:09.042 --> 13:11.696
-Mm.
-Or men.

13:13.872 --> 13:16.875
He only has eyes for food.

13:16.919 --> 13:19.095
You're mine.

13:22.098 --> 13:26.363
What is in these appetizers?

13:26.407 --> 13:28.235
[laughing] So...

13:28.278 --> 13:31.064
walk me through your
typical Thanksgiving menu

13:31.107 --> 13:34.067
one more time so I can get it
exactly right.

13:34.110 --> 13:36.156
Well, basically,
if it's in a can,

13:36.199 --> 13:37.984
it goes in a casserole.

13:39.855 --> 13:42.205
That is incredible.

13:42.249 --> 13:45.513
Murray, they dine on casseroles.

13:45.556 --> 13:47.297
Oh, I love 'em.

13:47.341 --> 13:49.473
You can put
just about anything in 'em.

13:49.517 --> 13:52.520
But you cannot skip the glue

13:52.563 --> 13:55.088
that holds it all together:
the American cheese.

13:55.131 --> 13:56.741
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.

13:58.352 --> 14:01.311
I'd rather eat a bullet
than American cheese.

14:01.355 --> 14:03.748
Oh, we all would, Francine.
We all would.

14:03.792 --> 14:05.185
But don't worry.

14:05.228 --> 14:06.229
-Tonight we dine in style.
-Mmm.

14:06.273 --> 14:08.144
-Spanakopita.
-Oh.

14:08.188 --> 14:10.407
-Lamb shanks that cascade
off the bone.
-Yes.

14:10.451 --> 14:13.106
-Bacon-filled dates flown in
from Jerusalem.
-Mmm.

14:13.149 --> 14:14.977
Okay, this all sounds
really amazing,

14:15.021 --> 14:17.414
but if this stuff is cooking,
why don't I smell it?

14:17.458 --> 14:19.329
Oh, I couldn't cook
all that here.

14:19.373 --> 14:22.158
Didn't you hear the man?
There's spanakopita...

14:22.202 --> 14:24.943
We got it, Francine!

14:24.987 --> 14:26.945
[stammers] A feast
of this size and scale

14:26.989 --> 14:29.209
could only be prepared in
a commercial kitchen.

14:29.252 --> 14:31.559
Uh, luckily, with Shady Meadows
closed for the holidays,

14:31.602 --> 14:33.126
the dining hall
was just the place.

14:33.169 --> 14:35.215
Okay, so when do I eat?

14:35.258 --> 14:37.086
Soon. Oh, very soon.

14:37.130 --> 14:39.306
-In fact, uh, we should
go check on our dishes.
-Ah.

14:39.349 --> 14:41.917
Why don't we go down now,
and you two, uh,

14:41.960 --> 14:44.006
well, stay here
and set the table. Hmm?

14:44.050 --> 14:46.226
Uh, maybe, uh, clean up a bit.

14:46.269 --> 14:49.142
The room. And yourselves.

14:52.797 --> 14:55.670
Okay, this is super weird,
right?

14:55.713 --> 14:58.151
What is going on here?

14:58.194 --> 14:59.108
I'll tell you what's going on.

14:59.152 --> 15:00.892
You are not doing

15:00.936 --> 15:02.981
your share of the chores.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.557
They've been gone
for over an hour.

15:13.601 --> 15:15.124
I am ravenous.

15:15.168 --> 15:17.692
Who locks their refrigerator?

15:17.735 --> 15:19.607
Full disclosure.

15:19.650 --> 15:23.480
I ate a pinch of fish food
a minute ago.

15:23.524 --> 15:25.134
Fuller disclosure.

15:25.178 --> 15:27.267
I almost ate the fish.

15:27.310 --> 15:30.400
Screw you, Murray, I'm staying!

15:30.444 --> 15:32.272
Well, where's Murray?

15:32.315 --> 15:34.143
What are you guys doing here?

15:34.187 --> 15:36.580
We had no other place to go.
Y'all bailed on us.

15:36.624 --> 15:38.495
And we wound up at Dudley's.

15:38.539 --> 15:40.062
-Dudley's!
-Yeah.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.411
Where the hell is everybody?

15:41.455 --> 15:43.196
Yeah, and where's the food?

15:43.239 --> 15:45.981
[scoffs] Boys,
I don't think you understand

15:46.024 --> 15:48.201
how classy parties work.

15:48.244 --> 15:52.857
You only get food if you get
the trivia questions right.

15:54.424 --> 15:58.428
If you get them wrong,
it goes to Murray's dog.

15:58.472 --> 16:00.517
So they gave your food
to the dog,

16:00.561 --> 16:02.389
and then the host
just left you here?

16:02.432 --> 16:04.347
[laughing]: Hank.

16:06.306 --> 16:08.395
You are hopelessly
working class.

16:08.438 --> 16:11.006
This is all totally normal.

16:11.049 --> 16:14.052
Once we set the table
and clean ourselves...

16:15.358 --> 16:16.664
...Murray and his friends

16:16.707 --> 16:19.014
will return
from the big turkey kitchen

16:19.057 --> 16:22.191
and we'll have a feast.

16:22.235 --> 16:25.368
Hearing it out loud,
it does sound a little off.

16:25.412 --> 16:27.327
A little off?

16:27.370 --> 16:29.198
You know what?
We need to go downstairs

16:29.242 --> 16:31.331
and find out what's going on.

16:31.374 --> 16:35.770
Charlie, do you know any hard
Italian cow's milk cheeses?

16:35.813 --> 16:39.643
Well, off the top of my head,
there's Parmesan, Romano,

16:39.687 --> 16:43.212
Asiago, uh, Grana Padano,
there's...

16:43.256 --> 16:46.346
Damn it, I picked
the wrong plus-one.

16:47.521 --> 16:49.218
Well, we pulled it off.

16:49.262 --> 16:51.002
For the first time in years,

16:51.046 --> 16:53.440
our Thanksgiving finally had
a little excitement.

16:53.483 --> 16:56.443
Can you believe they're still up
there cleaning my apartment?

16:56.486 --> 16:58.488
And they're still expecting to
have a delicious dinner.

16:58.532 --> 17:02.840
The very delicious dinner that
we're eating right now.

17:02.884 --> 17:05.234
Oh, those peasants are going
to be as bitter

17:05.278 --> 17:08.281
-as in-season radicchio.
-[Murray laughs]

17:08.324 --> 17:12.067
Why play with one's food when
you can play with people?

17:12.110 --> 17:14.112
-Huh? [chuckles]
-[Francine laughs]

17:14.156 --> 17:16.158
I knew they were food snobs,

17:16.202 --> 17:18.639
but these people
are sociopaths.

17:18.682 --> 17:22.425
It's bad that I still find him
attractive, isn't it?

17:22.469 --> 17:26.299
Uh-uh, I-I get it.

17:26.342 --> 17:29.476
Are we ever gonna eat?

17:29.519 --> 17:32.305
Did you see the bottle of wine
that woman brought?

17:32.348 --> 17:36.134
There was a price tag on
the bottom. $17.99.

17:36.178 --> 17:37.266
[all laugh]

17:37.310 --> 17:38.659
Why are they laughing?

17:38.702 --> 17:41.923
Well, is it too high or too low?

17:46.319 --> 17:49.757
Who would do something that
horrible on Thanksgiving?

17:49.800 --> 17:52.063
Yeah, I bet you're feeling
pretty crappy

17:52.107 --> 17:53.456
you ditched us for them, huh?

17:53.500 --> 17:55.284
You know what? I am.

17:55.328 --> 17:57.417
I abandoned my friends,
and for what?

17:57.460 --> 17:59.419
Food that I never even
got to eat,

17:59.462 --> 18:03.423
and the most sadistic game
of trivia I've ever played.

18:03.466 --> 18:08.079
Yeah, well, at least you didn't
lose out to a freakin' dog.

18:08.123 --> 18:10.952
I'm sorry we messed up
your Thanksgiving Day, guys.

18:10.995 --> 18:12.997
No, the day's still young.

18:13.041 --> 18:15.304
We're about to find out what
Thanksgiving is really about.

18:15.348 --> 18:18.655
Yeah. Naps.

18:18.699 --> 18:20.353
No, Charlie.

18:20.396 --> 18:22.572
Friends. Together.

18:22.616 --> 18:26.446
Exacting sweet revenge on those
douchebags who harmed 'em.

18:26.489 --> 18:27.490
Who's with me?

18:27.534 --> 18:29.971
SID/MARGARET/CHARLIE:
We are.

18:37.065 --> 18:38.458
-Here it is.
-Ah.

18:38.501 --> 18:40.547
My famous pecan soufflé.

18:40.590 --> 18:42.331
Maybe we should find another
couple of rubes

18:42.375 --> 18:45.203
-and do this again next year.
-[Murray chuckles]

18:45.247 --> 18:49.730
Indeed. I haven't smiled
this much in a long time.

18:52.950 --> 18:56.780
You know, we may not need
to find other rubes.

18:56.824 --> 19:01.045
I'm not so sure we couldn't
do it again to these idiots.

19:01.089 --> 19:04.353
Oh, you mean us idiots?

19:04.397 --> 19:06.355
Yes, yes, I do.

19:06.399 --> 19:07.487
[gasps] Oh.

19:07.530 --> 19:10.751
We're busted. Ooh.

19:10.794 --> 19:13.014
Well, what are you going
to do about it?

19:13.057 --> 19:15.930
We finished dinner and we're
almost done with dessert.

19:15.973 --> 19:18.019
You're right, Francine.
You won.

19:18.062 --> 19:20.543
You are so much smarter
than we are.

19:20.587 --> 19:22.458
So much so that we would like

19:22.502 --> 19:24.199
to play a little game of trivia
with you.

19:24.242 --> 19:25.635
-What? Oh, well, very well.
-[chuckles]

19:25.679 --> 19:27.289
-Shoot.
-All right.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.595
See if you can name
all the ingredients

19:28.638 --> 19:30.510
in that soufflé
that you're eating.

19:30.553 --> 19:33.034
Well, that's easy.
Butter, eggs, pecans...

19:33.077 --> 19:35.515
Ah, you forgot
the secret ingredients

19:35.558 --> 19:37.647
we slipped in there
when y'all were having dinner.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.650
Yeah, that's right.
The soufflé needed

19:40.694 --> 19:43.610
some sort of glue
to hold it together.

19:43.653 --> 19:49.006
The glue known as...
American cheese.

19:49.050 --> 19:51.269
-[gasps, whimpers]
-Oh, no, no, no, no.

19:51.313 --> 19:52.836
[stammers] You can't be serious.

19:52.880 --> 19:56.666
MARGARET: You all are eating
pure American cheese.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.277
Zero percent dairy.

19:59.321 --> 20:01.541
Murray? What's happening?

20:01.584 --> 20:04.195
Am I poor now?

20:04.239 --> 20:07.068
You bums.
You-you bums!

20:07.111 --> 20:09.679
Oh, shut up, you Australian
son of a bitch.

20:09.723 --> 20:11.333
Yeah, that's what you get
for messing

20:11.377 --> 20:12.552
-with this crew, Murray.
-Yeah.

20:12.595 --> 20:14.510
[gagging]

20:15.903 --> 20:18.558
[laughing] Oh, revenge is sweet.

20:18.601 --> 20:20.255
[Sid sighs]

20:20.298 --> 20:23.301
Not as sweet as food, though.
We need to eat something.

20:23.345 --> 20:27.131
Well, let's go to my apartment.
I'll whip up some casseroles.

20:27.175 --> 20:28.916
Well, not an option.

20:28.959 --> 20:32.441
We, uh, we trashed the place.

20:32.485 --> 20:34.617
Well, what are we gonna do?

20:34.661 --> 20:36.793
MARGARET:
Oh, man, I was so hungry.

20:38.882 --> 20:41.711
[overlapping chatter]

20:41.755 --> 20:43.713
You know, I got to tell you,
Dudley,

20:43.757 --> 20:46.673
I-I actually enjoy imagining
the players.

20:46.716 --> 20:48.675
-It's nice, isn't it?
-It is.

20:48.718 --> 20:50.546
Yeah. I-I'm sure glad
you all came over.

20:50.590 --> 20:52.722
You really turned my day around.

20:52.766 --> 20:54.811
Aw. This has been great.

20:54.855 --> 20:57.466
I can't believe I thought
Thanksgiving with Murray

20:57.510 --> 20:59.555
was gonna be better
than you guys.

20:59.599 --> 21:00.948
Nothing's better than us,
Margaret.

21:00.991 --> 21:02.689
You should know that by now.

21:02.732 --> 21:05.561
Hey, happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

21:05.605 --> 21:07.520
ALL:
Happy Thanksgiving.

21:07.563 --> 21:09.522
Yeah, happy Thanksgiving.

21:09.565 --> 21:13.177
Now can we please turn
this damn football off?

21:13.221 --> 21:15.919

-And rock and roll!
-Whoa.
