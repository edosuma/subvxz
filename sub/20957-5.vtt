WEBVTT

00:07.024 --> 00:08.990
- Previously on Wynonna Earp...
- We're not savages.

00:08.992 --> 00:12.328
A briefcase was stolen from a
field marshal in the triangle.

00:12.331 --> 00:14.321
This is my one shot to get...

00:14.324 --> 00:16.442
Waverly! No!

00:16.445 --> 00:19.246
- I know what I saw.
- Yet Waverly still seems to be intact.

00:19.249 --> 00:21.850
Shit! Don't, don't, don't!

00:23.805 --> 00:27.538
- That weirdness in Waverly...
- All of the cutlery has gone missing.

00:27.541 --> 00:30.602
This perfect pool of shiny goo...

00:30.604 --> 00:36.776
- It was calling to me.
- What are we going to do with you, hmm?

00:39.629 --> 00:43.448
Let me go! Help!

00:43.451 --> 00:45.953
Get off of me!

00:45.955 --> 00:48.859
What the hell? Is that blood?

00:50.000 --> 00:56.074

00:58.058 --> 00:59.828
Silence!

00:59.830 --> 01:02.356
Under sentence by the Order.

01:02.358 --> 01:04.687
In the shadow of eternal life,

01:04.688 --> 01:07.149
the beast shall be slaughtered.

01:09.088 --> 01:13.484
My others will make the rivers

01:13.486 --> 01:16.669
run red with your pig's blood!

01:18.640 --> 01:20.706
Nifty.

01:27.601 --> 01:30.902
Brothers, our reward is near.

01:30.905 --> 01:32.873
Only one remains

01:32.874 --> 01:34.842
to be cleaved from this world.

01:39.803 --> 01:41.250
Now.

01:41.253 --> 01:43.933
Who wants nachos?

01:47.383 --> 01:50.795
Good morning!

01:53.286 --> 01:56.178
Ooh! Home fries,

01:56.180 --> 01:58.214
bacon, and...

02:00.190 --> 02:02.224
Mm! Fresh!

02:02.226 --> 02:04.357
The piece de résistance.

02:04.359 --> 02:06.549
Bloody Mary!

02:10.435 --> 02:12.370
You could show the
teensiest bit of excitement.

02:12.373 --> 02:15.661
- We're not really smoothie people.
- Oh!

02:15.663 --> 02:18.156
Success!

02:19.768 --> 02:23.758
Beautiful. Mm! Garnish.

02:26.455 --> 02:29.151
Oh, you're not vegan,

02:29.153 --> 02:32.018
are you?

02:33.909 --> 02:37.616
Spoons! Uh, shiny things!

02:37.619 --> 02:40.061
Metal! I... I was
collecting them for you.

02:40.064 --> 02:43.856
Mm! I checked the barn

02:43.858 --> 02:46.857
12 hours ago, and still
some work to be done.

02:46.859 --> 02:49.049
Way to go, slacker.

02:49.051 --> 02:51.994
Hey! I salted the rim!

02:51.997 --> 02:53.669
I'm not a savage!

02:53.671 --> 02:56.063
Wynonna, I know you're
in there. Come on!

02:56.065 --> 02:58.492
- You can fight this thing!
- Ah, no.

02:58.494 --> 03:00.515
You could fight me.

03:00.517 --> 03:02.268
It was exhausting,

03:02.271 --> 03:05.363
being inside of you, all that goodness.

03:05.366 --> 03:08.441
You were in my brain.
I'll remember a weakness.

03:08.443 --> 03:10.700
Fighting demons is what we do!

03:10.702 --> 03:13.026
What do you think I'll do?

03:15.186 --> 03:17.715
Any idea...

03:17.717 --> 03:19.738
how many of your friends

03:19.740 --> 03:22.031
will survive the day?

03:22.033 --> 03:25.877
In fact...

03:25.879 --> 03:28.337
you're annoying.

03:28.339 --> 03:31.137
I think you'll go first.

03:31.139 --> 03:33.497
No, no, no! Wynonna!

03:36.299 --> 03:39.109
No! No, Wynonna, please!

03:39.111 --> 03:42.155
Waves...

03:42.157 --> 03:45.695
- Wynonna! Yeah! Yes!
- It hurts, but I'm trying!

03:45.697 --> 03:48.740
- Come on! Come on! Please!
- I'm trying!

03:48.742 --> 03:52.010
Ride's here.

03:54.003 --> 03:57.708
This'll have to wait. Eat up!

04:01.746 --> 04:05.451
Catch you on the flippity-flop!

04:10.716 --> 04:14.663
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

04:32.554 --> 04:35.301
Tell me the truth, Wynonna.

04:35.303 --> 04:37.741
Is she red enough?

04:37.744 --> 04:41.290
- Let's get going!
- What about your fairer half?

04:41.292 --> 04:43.110
Oh, she's sick.

04:43.112 --> 04:45.414
She's got a bout of influenza?

04:47.414 --> 04:49.232
Any word on lily-livered Lucado?

04:49.234 --> 04:51.416
I was gonna ask you the same
thing. Are you sure Waverly is...

04:51.418 --> 04:54.229
- Whoa! Are those... pants?
- I sure hope so.

04:54.231 --> 04:57.141
New... I meant, new pants.

04:57.143 --> 05:00.682
It's not that I don't always
notice your tight little rump,

05:00.684 --> 05:03.892
but today's junk in the trunk
is especially delightful.

05:03.894 --> 05:06.010
Are you feeling all right?

05:11.252 --> 05:15.774
It was a Bloody Mary morning
and a Tequila Sunrise sunset.

05:15.777 --> 05:18.489
- So Waverly is, uh...
- A little tied up.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.249
A lot hungover.

05:23.191 --> 05:25.260
You don't wanna go in there. Trust me.

05:27.540 --> 05:31.314
I always do.

05:56.580 --> 05:58.583
Unique conditions that could

05:58.586 --> 06:00.761
add up to a very rare
thunder-snow storm.

06:00.764 --> 06:02.343
Surprised you haven't
inquired on the state

06:02.345 --> 06:04.348
of our patient. Dolls is improving.

06:04.351 --> 06:07.023
Right.

06:07.025 --> 06:09.227
Hey! The top nine and nine

06:09.229 --> 06:11.699
is coming up next!

06:11.701 --> 06:13.703
Is that the ancient plate?

06:13.705 --> 06:16.877
People seem intent on killing over this.

06:16.879 --> 06:18.782
The sooner you identify it, the better.

06:18.784 --> 06:21.893
OK! Ho ho ho!

06:21.896 --> 06:23.793
OK...

06:23.795 --> 06:26.800
Purgatory Fair, 1952.

06:26.802 --> 06:29.338
- Was it a good one?
- I was at the bottom of a well.

06:29.340 --> 06:31.343
Hard core.

06:31.345 --> 06:34.350
Odd.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.556
- You really are.
- No.

06:36.558 --> 06:39.136
This paint isn't from 1952.

06:39.139 --> 06:40.498
It doesn't taste like lead.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.635
Then it is hiding something.

06:42.637 --> 06:45.776
Oh! I can use my laser
optical coherence tomographer!

06:45.778 --> 06:47.853
I can take

06:47.856 --> 06:49.585
a photo of what's underneath the paint.

06:49.587 --> 06:52.357
Or we could skip straight to the dying.

06:53.991 --> 07:00.143
This is gonna be so cool! Waaaaaa.

07:02.749 --> 07:05.654
OK, yeah! It's just as I thought.

07:05.656 --> 07:07.693
There is an obscured etching here.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.499
It feels like I've
seen this symbol before.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.710
'Cause it's on the Purgatory
Volunteer Fire Hall,

07:15.712 --> 07:17.789
Third and Main.

07:17.792 --> 07:20.121
Lived here my whole life, remember?

07:20.123 --> 07:21.992
How do you pull up the
weather on this thing?

07:21.994 --> 07:24.998
Yeah. I'd like to take this
plate back to headquarters,

07:25.000 --> 07:26.903
compare the etchings
with the BBD archives.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.142
You know, the last gentleman
who transported this plate?

07:29.144 --> 07:31.446
He ended up hacked to pieces by demons.

07:31.448 --> 07:34.888
Yeah. Phot... photo's fine.

07:34.890 --> 07:38.362
I think we should pay
this fire house a visit.

07:38.364 --> 07:41.082
I'll read the report.
I've got plans. Hm.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.608
Waverly nearly died to retrieve this.

07:45.780 --> 07:49.654
Long as I'm back before dark. I mean,

07:49.656 --> 07:52.527
to check on her. She's sick, right?

07:52.529 --> 07:55.200
Hungover.

07:55.202 --> 07:57.205
Pitter-patter! Can't let

07:57.207 --> 07:59.510
the trail go cold.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.548
Help!

08:01.550 --> 08:03.656
Help!

08:03.658 --> 08:05.828
Help!

08:07.835 --> 08:09.839
Wha...?

08:09.841 --> 08:12.814
I'm armed! And trÃ¨s pissed!

08:17.997 --> 08:21.072
Oh, yay! Dolls!

08:21.074 --> 08:23.946
- Oh my God, you're up and about!
- Yeah, that makes one of us.

08:23.948 --> 08:26.822
- Where's your weapon?
- I was bluffing, silly!

08:26.824 --> 08:30.297
Thank you! We need to find Wynonna.

08:30.299 --> 08:33.038
Tell me why I shouldn't kill
you right here, right now.

08:33.041 --> 08:35.880
For starters, I'm
tied to a chair. Again.

08:35.881 --> 08:38.956
- I know what you are. Demon!
- Oh! You're an hour late

08:38.957 --> 08:41.395
and an Earp short. It jumped
into Wynonna last night.

08:41.398 --> 08:43.769
It's gonna hurt her and everyone else.

08:43.770 --> 08:46.659
Where was the first place we met?

08:46.662 --> 08:48.449
Outside Shorty's. Wynonna
put a knife to your throat.

08:48.451 --> 08:51.257
- Favourite food? - Lasagna.
- Real favourite food!

08:51.259 --> 08:53.396
Sweet and sour soup with
a dollop of peanut butter.

08:53.399 --> 08:54.299
So you could just

08:54.301 --> 08:56.372
be reading Waverly's
thoughts right now, right?

08:56.374 --> 08:59.447
Because I know what
I saw... in the barn.

08:59.449 --> 09:01.453
Oh my God.

09:01.455 --> 09:04.394
I was there, wasn't I?

09:04.396 --> 09:06.400
And...

09:06.402 --> 09:09.040
you were bleeding and wounded...

09:09.043 --> 09:11.047
and in pain.

09:11.049 --> 09:14.423
And I didn't... I couldn't see you.

09:14.425 --> 09:17.297
I couldn't help you...

09:17.299 --> 09:19.873
with that thing inside me. Oh, my God!

09:19.875 --> 09:22.449
Oh, Dolls, I'm so sorry.

09:26.062 --> 09:29.473
You could... you could have died.

09:29.475 --> 09:31.681
You know, I've seen a lot
of possessions in my life,

09:31.683 --> 09:34.356
and never one that incited

09:34.358 --> 09:36.731
so many apologies.

09:36.733 --> 09:40.412
I'm me.

09:42.822 --> 09:45.094
Yeah.

09:47.973 --> 09:50.111
I know.

09:50.113 --> 09:52.186
I know...

09:52.188 --> 09:55.297
which means Wynonna is not.

09:55.299 --> 09:58.039
- What's it gonna do?
- In Wynonna?

09:58.041 --> 10:00.046
Whatever it wants.

10:03.058 --> 10:05.720
You know the last major
storm we had in Purgatory,

10:05.723 --> 10:08.082
the mayor's street was
plowed before the hospital.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.880
Natural selection in action.

10:09.883 --> 10:11.386
You OK there?

10:11.388 --> 10:13.393
Underwire my ass! I swear

10:13.395 --> 10:15.232
- this thing fit yesterday!
- Hey, did Waves, uh,

10:15.234 --> 10:18.061
- pop in without me seeing her?
- She's home sick.

10:18.064 --> 10:21.641
Really? 'Cause I spoke to her
last night and she sounded fine.

10:23.072 --> 10:25.948
She's a good faker.
Or hadn't you noticed?

10:25.951 --> 10:29.161
It's just, I left three
messages. Did she get them,

10:29.164 --> 10:31.152
or?

10:33.463 --> 10:36.473
Three unreturned messages?

10:36.475 --> 10:38.480
Waverly needs

10:38.482 --> 10:40.486
space.

10:40.488 --> 10:42.996
She's dying under the weight of your...

10:42.998 --> 10:46.072
expectations.

10:46.074 --> 10:49.484
Waverly's not...

10:51.526 --> 10:54.670
the white picket fence

10:54.672 --> 10:57.246
in Purgatory girl

10:57.248 --> 10:59.385
you want her to be anymore.

10:59.387 --> 11:02.731
You know Wynonna, you're really
mean when you drink before noon.

11:02.733 --> 11:06.076
And you drink before noon too often.

11:06.078 --> 11:09.789
Hope your Tinder game's solid.

11:14.975 --> 11:17.115
She didn't deserve that.

11:17.117 --> 11:19.422
What,

11:19.424 --> 11:22.029
the truth?

11:22.032 --> 11:24.306
You spelled "possessed" wrong, stupid.

11:30.950 --> 11:34.307
Ah! Son of a bitch!

11:38.341 --> 11:40.888
Try that again...

11:40.898 --> 11:43.506
and we'll bleed every last one of them

11:43.508 --> 11:47.219
- slowly.
- You comin' or not?

11:47.221 --> 11:49.234
Sure!

11:49.236 --> 11:51.127
Let's go stir it up.

12:14.910 --> 12:17.130
I could always feel it inside me.

12:17.133 --> 12:19.953
Like, jockeying for position.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.994
Yeah, like working at me.

12:21.996 --> 12:24.277
You know, gnawing at me.

12:24.279 --> 12:26.092
Like...

12:26.095 --> 12:28.608
like a thousand tiny fingers, prying.

12:28.611 --> 12:31.463
In Black Badge, we call them passengers.

12:31.465 --> 12:34.890
When it took over, I...
I remembered nothing.

12:34.892 --> 12:38.684
Except that suddenly one felt like many.

12:38.686 --> 12:42.289
- Fractured.
- Yeah. Or multiplied.

12:42.292 --> 12:44.828
- Becoming...
- Legion.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.120
Yeah...

12:47.123 --> 12:49.136
though it never did

12:49.138 --> 12:51.286
anything as cool as breathe fire.

12:53.163 --> 12:55.584
Yeah.

12:55.586 --> 12:57.767
Yeah, the thing in me is...

12:57.769 --> 13:00.218
not a passenger.

13:00.220 --> 13:02.300
It's just me.

13:02.302 --> 13:05.054
It jumped into Wynonna because

13:05.056 --> 13:07.035
I wouldn't do what it wanted.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.849
- Which was what?
- I don't know.

13:08.851 --> 13:11.434
I was fighting too hard to ask.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.547
For seven weeks?

13:21.677 --> 13:23.437
We can't let it take Wynonna.

13:23.440 --> 13:26.512
Nothing will stop us from trying.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.266
OK?

13:29.268 --> 13:30.609
Not even

13:30.611 --> 13:33.967
you.

13:33.969 --> 13:36.854
So the symbol on an ancient plate

13:36.856 --> 13:39.710
coveted by both Black
Badge and the demon mob

13:39.712 --> 13:42.127
matches that hanging
on the local fire hall.

13:42.129 --> 13:43.909
Are we walking into a den of evil

13:43.912 --> 13:45.924
or an innocuous small-town brigade?

13:45.927 --> 13:47.895
You will find that the
Ghost River Triangle

13:47.898 --> 13:50.223
never stops coughing up new secrets.

13:52.136 --> 13:55.156
Besides, any Dicksons that get
the jump on us? We'll be ready.

14:02.177 --> 14:05.579
A lot of places nearby.
Let's blow this off

14:05.582 --> 14:08.622
and spend the day without clothing.

14:08.624 --> 14:12.559
I asked the boss, and I'm sorry.

14:12.562 --> 14:14.129
There's no refills on pancakes.

14:14.131 --> 14:16.043
Well, tell your boss that's bullshit.

14:16.045 --> 14:18.327
I can take that

14:18.329 --> 14:21.417
- if you're all done with it.
- Let's get to the station.

14:21.419 --> 14:24.203
Wee-oo! Wee-oo! Wee-oo!

14:24.205 --> 14:26.420
She likes to look at the trucks.

14:29.409 --> 14:32.539
Before I kill you, I'm
gonna need my briefcase.

14:32.542 --> 14:35.558
You abandoned two Black Badge
agents during a sting op.

14:35.561 --> 14:37.838
- I'm pretty sure you're fired.
- And I'm pretty sure

14:37.841 --> 14:39.012
- you're dead.
- Guys!

14:46.940 --> 14:48.837
You sent mercenaries to kill me!

14:48.840 --> 14:51.069
You were a wanted fugitive!

15:03.965 --> 15:06.012
- Oh, all right.
- Hee-yeah!

15:08.062 --> 15:10.411
Ah!

15:26.060 --> 15:28.713
Oh! Oh man!

15:31.098 --> 15:33.413
Guys! Guys, we just replaced that!

15:37.411 --> 15:39.324
OK.

15:43.657 --> 15:46.309
- This is personal.
- This is, too.

15:46.311 --> 15:48.693
Quit it, you assholes!

15:48.695 --> 15:51.077
Wynonna's possessed,
and we don't have time

15:51.079 --> 15:53.159
for you two to go all UFC on each other!

15:53.161 --> 15:55.107
What's the situation?

15:59.104 --> 16:01.118
Huh.

16:01.120 --> 16:04.980
Well frankly, Lucado,
the situation is balls.

16:04.982 --> 16:07.095
See? That's a match.

16:07.097 --> 16:09.178
Well, since we know
practically nothing, perhaps

16:09.180 --> 16:11.864
we should get them talking.
Speaking of subtlety...

16:23.521 --> 16:25.699
I know they are firefighters,

16:25.701 --> 16:28.050
but this seems like an excess of axes.

16:31.342 --> 16:34.095
Too many of us have met our ends here.

16:38.394 --> 16:41.919
- How dare they!
- You folks here for a tour?

16:41.921 --> 16:44.115
People usually bring their kids.

16:44.118 --> 16:45.986
Oh, we're kids at heart.

16:45.989 --> 16:49.010
Captain Ewan Allenbach. What
do you think of our house?

16:49.013 --> 16:51.892
We were just admiring
the symbol out front.

16:51.894 --> 16:54.512
Oh, yeah. Um, if you're interested,

16:54.514 --> 16:56.661
we're always looking for new volunteers.

16:56.663 --> 17:00.623
Oh, by the looks of it, y'all
do too many sit-ups for my taste.

17:03.580 --> 17:07.070
Name is Wynonna Earp.
Mean anything to you?

17:07.073 --> 17:11.032
I've seen a few Westerns, yeah.

17:11.035 --> 17:13.061
Horrible deeds have been committed here.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.652
I mean, hate to take
offence, but generally

17:14.654 --> 17:16.675
speaking, our goal is to save lives.

17:16.676 --> 17:18.757
Which lives?

17:18.759 --> 17:23.223
Hm. Ah... a little
history about the place.

17:23.224 --> 17:25.775
It was built on the
site of an old church,

17:25.777 --> 17:29.435
so the ground is consecrated.
They say that those who walk

17:29.437 --> 17:32.089
in sin can have a bit of a reaction.

17:32.091 --> 17:35.649
Have you done bad things?

17:39.813 --> 17:42.600
The sister's been a little sick.

17:42.602 --> 17:45.750
I think Miss Earp is coming
down with something too.

17:45.752 --> 17:47.830
Uh, well we got a medic on site.

17:47.832 --> 17:50.711
I'm sure we could take care
of whatever's bothering her.

17:50.714 --> 17:53.541
Oh, we'll leave it be.
You know, tree, cats,

17:53.544 --> 17:55.885
won't rescue themselves!

18:01.979 --> 18:04.860
Juan Carlo isn't gonna like this.

18:04.862 --> 18:08.213
Let's get you straight home to bed!

18:08.215 --> 18:10.526
I just need a minute...

18:10.528 --> 18:13.107
and some water. Do I have any water?

18:13.109 --> 18:15.186
Got some water right here.

18:15.188 --> 18:17.701
A steak knife?

18:17.703 --> 18:20.583
You saw how aggressive he was.

18:23.501 --> 18:25.217
And, uh...

18:25.220 --> 18:27.456
Peacemaker?

18:27.458 --> 18:29.636
That's what I thought!

18:29.638 --> 18:32.590
Wynonna Earp never leaves
the house without that gun,

18:32.593 --> 18:35.395
and she drinks her coffee black.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.352
- Couldn't have called ahead?
- I thought you were in bed!

18:40.355 --> 18:42.198
Besides...

18:42.200 --> 18:45.014
you love surprises!

18:45.016 --> 18:47.592
Oh, my! I never should
have touched that goo!

18:47.595 --> 18:49.842
- I'm so sorry, Wynonna!
- Hell fire

18:49.845 --> 18:52.289
shall quicken against your
flesh and devour your soul,

18:52.291 --> 18:55.608
dragging you into its
everlasting depths!

18:55.610 --> 18:57.621
Come on!

18:57.623 --> 19:01.275
I said I was sorry!

19:01.277 --> 19:04.594
- So your hand was severed.
- Yeah, but it grew back.

19:04.596 --> 19:07.141
It grew it back like an evil starfish.

19:07.143 --> 19:09.648
And now it's in Wynonna and
controls everything that she is.

19:09.650 --> 19:12.047
With killer instincts and a magical gun.

19:12.050 --> 19:15.635
A gun she cannot touch.
Not while the demon abides.

19:17.065 --> 19:19.222
Well, Black Badge must be
able to do something, right?

19:19.225 --> 19:21.561
- We could call HQ? Moody?
- I'm still on their

19:21.564 --> 19:23.405
Do Not Resuscitate list.

19:27.962 --> 19:30.844
OK, BBD is not returning my calls.

19:30.846 --> 19:32.445
They never received the briefcase.

19:32.448 --> 19:36.019
So since then it's been radio
silence. Thanks for that.

19:36.022 --> 19:38.185
- Well, we need to do something.
- It would be helpful

19:38.187 --> 19:41.069
if we could get a
sample of the substance

19:41.071 --> 19:43.584
- that Waverly originally touched.
- The tentacle goo?

19:43.586 --> 19:47.172
It was at the arch. Where Willa died.

19:47.174 --> 19:49.183
Doc?

19:49.185 --> 19:51.228
Well, we could take my new car.

19:51.230 --> 19:53.608
It's got a cassette player!

19:53.610 --> 19:56.017
Hey, and I hope I don't
need to stress this,

19:56.020 --> 19:57.661
but don't touch the goo.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.841
Oh, I don't even take free samples

19:59.844 --> 20:02.324
at the grocery store anymore.

20:06.046 --> 20:08.057
Any residue will be long gone.

20:08.060 --> 20:09.700
- It'll keep them occupied.
- Yeah, this is

20:09.702 --> 20:11.668
a bit too familiar, even for Purgatory.

20:11.671 --> 20:13.706
The report said it was
defeated in Budapest.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.322
Yeah, and the office
went dark two weeks later.

20:16.325 --> 20:18.737
- That night in Kabul.
- It's been tracking me ever since.

20:18.740 --> 20:20.767
I remember seeing it last year

20:20.771 --> 20:24.266
during an exorcism.
In an obsidian mirror.

20:24.269 --> 20:26.329
You can't even say its name.

20:26.331 --> 20:30.017
Mikshun.

20:30.019 --> 20:32.497
There's never been

20:32.499 --> 20:35.850
- a successful unbinding.
- Under the right circumstances,

20:35.852 --> 20:37.861
it could spread through
an entire population.

20:37.863 --> 20:40.544
- Well we need to prove it.
- That means blood, tissue

20:40.546 --> 20:43.394
bone.

20:43.396 --> 20:46.377
She hates me anyways.

20:54.149 --> 20:56.133
We both know it has to be me.

21:00.928 --> 21:04.515
You finally met Wynonna Earp.

21:04.517 --> 21:06.861
She is infected.

21:06.863 --> 21:09.912
The final one under Mikshun's influence.

21:09.914 --> 21:13.198
The Heir could be an ally.

21:13.200 --> 21:16.148
Ally? I have neither the patience

21:16.150 --> 21:18.830
nor the time to babysit the latest Earp.

21:18.832 --> 21:22.317
She has people who care about her, Ewan.

21:22.319 --> 21:24.395
- Could be they find a way.
- And give the demon

21:24.397 --> 21:26.643
a chance to multiply? Again?

21:26.645 --> 21:30.296
I have lost two men this month,

21:30.298 --> 21:32.575
and the rest of us...

21:32.577 --> 21:34.654
are exhausted.

21:34.656 --> 21:37.336
No one promised light work.

21:37.338 --> 21:39.549
OK.

21:39.551 --> 21:42.499
An insignia seal has been exposed.

21:42.501 --> 21:45.785
Broken. Would you happen
to know anything about that?

21:45.787 --> 21:48.132
We all have a role to play.

21:48.134 --> 21:51.878
The Heir and her position
should not be taken lightly.

21:51.881 --> 21:55.306
The Order appreciates
your guidance, Juan Carlo.

21:55.308 --> 21:57.318
We always have...

21:57.320 --> 21:59.731
but they follow my word.

21:59.733 --> 22:02.201
We end it tonight.

22:06.875 --> 22:09.051
Playing the good cop, Xavier?

22:09.053 --> 22:12.036
Predictable.

22:14.485 --> 22:17.736
We gonna talk, demon to demon?

22:17.739 --> 22:21.322
'Cause I got places I gotta be.

22:21.324 --> 22:23.334
How about you vacate her body

22:23.336 --> 22:25.983
and then, maybe, I might call you a cab?

22:25.985 --> 22:28.697
And lose this sweet ride?

22:28.699 --> 22:30.709
Have you seen

22:30.711 --> 22:32.855
these curves up close? Hm?

22:32.857 --> 22:35.672
Oh, wait.

22:35.674 --> 22:37.917
You haven't.

22:37.919 --> 22:40.518
Not yet.

22:40.521 --> 22:43.369
But you know,

22:43.372 --> 22:45.125
that can be arranged.

22:45.127 --> 22:48.109
For a price.

22:48.111 --> 22:50.222
You're not her.

22:52.027 --> 22:54.296
I'll be anything you want me to be.

23:04.404 --> 23:06.062
How 'bout quiet?

23:12.819 --> 23:15.030
- You don't have the stones.
- I don't have a choice.

23:15.032 --> 23:18.283
What... you wouldn't!

23:18.285 --> 23:22.339
You wouldn't mutilate her,
your darling Wynonna...

23:22.341 --> 23:25.893
- Waverly regenerated.
- Hm, she was special that way.

23:25.895 --> 23:29.246
That trick won't work on your girl.

23:29.249 --> 23:30.653
You're lying.

23:32.666 --> 23:35.374
Please. Dolls, please.

23:35.377 --> 23:37.927
There's another way. There
has to be another way.

23:37.930 --> 23:39.975
You can find it. Please.

23:42.656 --> 23:46.310
Dolls! Do it.

23:48.825 --> 23:51.807
I'm sorry.

23:51.809 --> 23:54.356
Ah!

24:19.267 --> 24:21.176
Did she cry?

24:21.178 --> 24:23.992
- I bet she cried.
- Just make this worthwhile.

24:23.994 --> 24:26.905
If you really want what's best
for her, we bring her into HQ.

24:26.908 --> 24:28.635
So they can dissect her? Not a chance.

24:28.638 --> 24:30.362
I doubt there's a
happily-ever-after here.

24:30.364 --> 24:33.716
OK? Dolls, be smart. We deliver Wynonna

24:33.718 --> 24:36.162
to Black Badge, we are
both finally in the clear.

24:36.164 --> 24:38.978
Otherwise? We're done.

24:41.191 --> 24:43.606
She stays here until this is over.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.656
One way or another.

24:45.659 --> 24:47.962
I got you the sample.

24:47.964 --> 24:51.584
Now analyze it.

24:51.586 --> 24:54.970
Do you think demon goo leeches
into soil or evaporates?

24:54.972 --> 24:57.082
Oh, chemistry is not my department.

24:57.084 --> 24:59.496
Is that why you hired hottie mixologist?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.542
Oh, you think she's hot?

25:03.688 --> 25:06.738
You expecting a friend?

25:06.740 --> 25:09.251
Oh, for the love of Pete.

25:09.253 --> 25:11.867
This is the gentleman

25:11.870 --> 25:13.778
who gave Dolls a lift back to town.

25:13.780 --> 25:17.197
- Probably saved his life.
- I did nothing so heroic.

25:17.199 --> 25:20.181
I'm quite unable.

25:20.183 --> 25:23.467
Seems a waste of precious
time, the two of you out here.

25:23.469 --> 25:26.653
And how we spend our time
matters to you because...

25:26.655 --> 25:30.339
No demon residue left here to
find. The Order took care of that.

25:30.341 --> 25:33.425
Sorry, who are they? And do
you think they might share?

25:33.427 --> 25:36.240
Holliday met them this morning.

25:36.242 --> 25:39.806
The muscled-up firefighters.
What do they want

25:39.809 --> 25:41.612
- with demon goo?
- They're a danger

25:41.615 --> 25:44.890
- to one of yours.
- Wynonna.

25:44.892 --> 25:47.270
- Mortal danger.
- Wait, so what do we do?

25:47.272 --> 25:50.824
Give them something that they want more.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.020
He disappeared.

25:56.030 --> 25:58.372
Yeah. He does that.

25:58.375 --> 25:59.641
It's infuriating.

25:59.643 --> 26:01.653
Now what do we have

26:01.655 --> 26:04.469
that the Order might want?

26:04.471 --> 26:06.191
Got it.

26:06.194 --> 26:08.059
There's like nine
different plants you can use

26:08.062 --> 26:10.738
to unbind a demon from the host.

26:10.740 --> 26:14.426
What do you got, Lucado?

26:14.428 --> 26:16.488
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

26:16.489 --> 26:18.272
It's whispering.

26:18.275 --> 26:21.970
No... singing?

26:21.972 --> 26:24.355
Back away now.

26:24.358 --> 26:26.026
Black Badge won't have me.

26:26.028 --> 26:29.244
I don't wanna be alone.

26:29.246 --> 26:31.960
Jeannie, don't. Jeannie.

26:31.962 --> 26:33.985
Lucado!

26:33.987 --> 26:36.752
Home.

26:36.754 --> 26:38.911
We are legion once more.

26:38.913 --> 26:41.690
Hey. OK.

26:41.715 --> 26:43.066
Look, we're gonna take a walk

26:43.069 --> 26:47.078
- over to the holding cell, OK?
- Yes, we are. To free my other.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.892
Dolls... get back.

27:01.894 --> 27:04.017
Don't let it touch you.

27:11.308 --> 27:13.091
Oh, Dolls!

27:13.093 --> 27:15.117
You did it!

27:17.312 --> 27:19.503
Of course not! Whoa, no, no.

27:19.506 --> 27:22.979
Of course not. She... touched
the goo, and it turns out

27:22.982 --> 27:25.752
- she wasn't as resilient as you.
- Or it's getting stronger.

27:25.755 --> 27:29.052
Mikshun. Its name is Mikshun.

27:29.054 --> 27:32.630
Like that time I put a can
of pasta in the microwave.

27:32.632 --> 27:35.802
Doc! She was a human being.

27:35.804 --> 27:37.962
Wait. Where did she get some goo?

27:40.255 --> 27:41.707
Come.

27:44.205 --> 27:47.377
OK, so I found this compound
that shocks the nervous system,

27:47.379 --> 27:49.874
right? It makes the demon
think it's in a dying body,

27:49.876 --> 27:52.303
and then it abandons it.

27:52.305 --> 27:53.937
But then what? I mean,

27:53.940 --> 27:56.166
Wynonna won't be able to
fire Peacemaker to kill it.

27:56.169 --> 27:58.235
Well, between my
revolvers and his pistol

27:58.238 --> 28:00.328
- we can slow it down, though.
- Did you see

28:00.331 --> 28:03.231
the tentacle last time? I
mean, no offence to your pistol,

28:03.234 --> 28:05.801
- but it won't leave a scratch!
- Waverly...

28:05.803 --> 28:08.400
just look around you, OK?

28:08.402 --> 28:10.525
We gotta get this thing out of Wynonna.

28:10.527 --> 28:12.583
Fast.

28:17.114 --> 28:19.636
How we doin' on ingredients?

28:19.638 --> 28:21.797
Well, um, we got...

28:21.799 --> 28:23.786
sage brush,

28:23.788 --> 28:26.048
sandalwood,

28:26.050 --> 28:28.848
and tamarisk. We got all the
stuff, just need a container.

28:28.850 --> 28:30.734
Well, say no more.

28:37.218 --> 28:39.816
Might need a rinse.

28:46.902 --> 28:48.926
Had a chance

28:48.928 --> 28:51.086
to regroup with your ginger pop tart?

28:51.088 --> 28:54.628
I might've caused some trouble.

28:54.631 --> 28:56.822
We're running out of time.

28:56.824 --> 28:59.691
She's a boring cop.

28:59.693 --> 29:01.816
You...

29:01.818 --> 29:04.381
are not boring.

29:06.576 --> 29:08.599
I don't wanna ruin the surprise...

29:09.914 --> 29:11.938
but you've got dark corners

29:11.941 --> 29:14.031
that you haven't explored yet.

29:17.577 --> 29:20.376
I'm not enough to save you, Wynonna.

29:22.402 --> 29:24.966
OK, are we having a moment?

29:24.968 --> 29:27.395
Hey.

29:27.397 --> 29:29.419
But you're enough to save me.

29:29.421 --> 29:32.094
Huh? No, if you're gonna sob,
you're gonna have to sob louder.

29:32.097 --> 29:34.279
- I trust you.
- What?

29:34.281 --> 29:37.114
Ow!

29:37.116 --> 29:39.712
There is only one way

29:39.714 --> 29:41.872
to make it stop and you
know what it is, Mikshun!

30:00.601 --> 30:03.906
Oh! Ah!

30:03.908 --> 30:07.012
Waverly Earp, you crafty fox!

30:07.014 --> 30:10.114
Mm. I'm flattered.

30:10.117 --> 30:12.714
Now we'll always be together.

30:12.716 --> 30:14.604
We heard screams.

30:14.606 --> 30:17.742
- Storm's coming.
- Stop her. Stop her!

30:18.856 --> 30:21.218
We need to get to the homestead.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.310
I know its plan. It's gonna

30:23.312 --> 30:26.010
build an army, starting with
Waverly. She took it back.

30:26.012 --> 30:29.350
- On purpose.
- Why would Waverly do that?

30:31.305 --> 30:34.615
Because I have Peacemaker...

30:34.617 --> 30:37.077
and I'm gonna save her.

30:39.273 --> 30:41.903
It's Mikshun!

30:41.905 --> 30:44.973
We're looking for the
Heir. That's just some girl.

30:44.976 --> 30:48.146
That girl has the demon inside her,

30:48.148 --> 30:51.858
which will spread like a
virus if we don't destroy it.

30:59.587 --> 31:02.791
Oh, right.

31:02.793 --> 31:04.984
You.

31:08.914 --> 31:11.497
History books will have
no mention of our names

31:11.499 --> 31:14.670
or our deeds.

31:14.672 --> 31:17.841
We've lost too many
brothers in this fight...

31:20.406 --> 31:22.869
but there is no higher
calling than protection,

31:22.871 --> 31:26.143
and there is no greater
service than preservation.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.686
Tonight, we will
eliminate one more threat.

31:29.688 --> 31:31.913
One more demon.

31:31.915 --> 31:36.131
Tonight, we will sacrifice one...

31:36.133 --> 31:37.914
for the good of the many.

31:37.917 --> 31:40.282
For the good of the many.

31:40.284 --> 31:42.441
For the good of the many!

31:42.443 --> 31:44.500
For the good of the many!

31:49.563 --> 31:52.093
Look, I know you need
space and I really tried

31:52.095 --> 31:54.285
to stay away, but I got worried,

31:54.287 --> 31:56.277
and there's signs of
struggle in the house,

31:56.279 --> 31:58.504
and Waverly, what the
hell is this... thing?

31:58.506 --> 32:00.461
- Stop! Stop!
- What!?

32:00.463 --> 32:02.486
Are you kidding?

32:02.489 --> 32:04.732
There is a thunder-snow storm coming.

32:04.735 --> 32:06.738
This thing is gonna attract
lightning like crazy.

32:06.740 --> 32:08.504
The whole barn could go up in flames!

32:08.507 --> 32:12.320
- Empty your bottles, boys.
- She touches that thing

32:12.323 --> 32:13.920
in the barn during a
lightning strike, the

32:13.922 --> 32:15.949
demon will be fused
with her body forever.

32:15.952 --> 32:17.367
Not another step, Mikshun.

32:17.370 --> 32:20.135
Out of my way, Renaissance fair.

32:20.138 --> 32:23.035
Baby!

32:23.038 --> 32:25.567
Baby, what is it?

32:25.569 --> 32:28.537
- In the shadow of eternal life.
- Holy water?

32:28.539 --> 32:32.147
- She's not a vampire!
- The ground is now consecrated.

32:32.149 --> 32:34.475
You will not get through.

32:34.477 --> 32:37.040
It's Wynonna! She's possessed!

32:37.042 --> 32:39.166
Like, demon took over
her body, planning to kill

32:39.168 --> 32:42.877
- us all, possessed.
- Did she hurt you?

32:42.879 --> 32:45.139
Yeah.

32:45.141 --> 32:48.007
- Wynonna... not like this.
- I will shoot

32:48.009 --> 32:50.356
every beak-billed, leg
day-loving last one of you.

32:50.357 --> 32:51.551
Where is she?

32:51.553 --> 32:53.845
- On the homestead?
- Yeah.

32:53.847 --> 32:56.713
Hey! Listen, we all wanna send

32:56.715 --> 32:58.569
this Mikshun back to Hell, right?

32:58.571 --> 33:00.526
We got the emollient that works.

33:00.528 --> 33:03.158
All you gotta do is
just... let us through.

33:03.161 --> 33:05.183
This one's possessed,

33:05.185 --> 33:07.241
as is the one in the barn,

33:07.243 --> 33:09.164
and tonight, they'll both die.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.055
The hell we will!

33:11.057 --> 33:13.754
I've got you now, OK?

33:13.756 --> 33:16.352
I swear, I've got you.

33:26.926 --> 33:29.693
I don't have time for your
weekend survivalist militia.

33:29.695 --> 33:32.189
If I was possessed, could I do this?

33:37.361 --> 33:39.082
Ah!

33:40.761 --> 33:42.954
I'm gonna say no.

33:42.956 --> 33:45.250
Now move.

33:45.253 --> 33:47.982
We've never been so close to the
complete eradication of Mikshun,

33:47.984 --> 33:51.011
and we are not taking any
more chances. So your sister

33:51.014 --> 33:53.449
will be, unfortunately,
collateral damage.

33:55.476 --> 33:57.263
Don't ever say "collateral damage"

33:57.265 --> 33:59.219
when you're talking about my sister.

33:59.221 --> 34:01.345
Hold up.

34:01.347 --> 34:05.361
Hold up.

34:05.363 --> 34:07.520
- What the hell is he doing?
- Don't you trust him?

34:07.522 --> 34:09.714
Always.

34:12.996 --> 34:16.574
Everybody just stay calm,
all right? Stay calm.

34:16.577 --> 34:18.319
We have something they want.

34:23.686 --> 34:25.878
Let us through...

34:25.880 --> 34:28.643
and it's yours.

34:38.398 --> 34:42.197
Only the Heir. You have 15 minutes.

34:42.199 --> 34:45.268
After that, your
sister's head will roll.

34:45.271 --> 34:47.949
You've made an enemy this Friday.

34:47.952 --> 34:49.257
It's Tuesday.

34:49.259 --> 34:51.436
Good to know.

34:58.308 --> 35:00.520
Step away from the lightning rod.

35:00.522 --> 35:03.437
Stand back, Wynonna.
Waverly told me everything.

35:03.439 --> 35:05.514
You come forward, and I'm... I'll shoot.

35:05.516 --> 35:07.525
Haught, settle down.

35:07.527 --> 35:09.604
The demon jumped into Waverly.

35:09.606 --> 35:12.554
- She needs to drink this. Now.
- Don't trust her.

35:12.556 --> 35:14.632
Yeah. Flask, demon did its homework.

35:14.634 --> 35:17.918
Nicole! You are not my sister's keeper.

35:17.920 --> 35:21.068
- That's the demon talking.
- No. It's me.

35:21.070 --> 35:23.247
Listen, I'll admit,

35:23.249 --> 35:25.661
you're... a little "queen
brisk of bossy town"

35:25.663 --> 35:28.174
for my taste, but I know

35:28.176 --> 35:30.649
that you love her and
you know I love her too,

35:30.652 --> 35:32.600
and now that thing
is trying to keep her.

35:32.602 --> 35:35.415
Shoot her. It's the only way.

35:37.054 --> 35:39.237
Waverly Earp would never
say something like that.

35:39.239 --> 35:41.683
- Never.
- Ugh.

35:41.685 --> 35:44.801
- You're weak.
- Oh Waverly, let her help you.

35:48.758 --> 35:51.807
Waverly, honey. Babe.

35:51.809 --> 35:55.226
I know you're in there.
I know you can hear me.

35:55.228 --> 35:57.070
Look what you did to the woman you love.

35:59.418 --> 36:02.365
Oh...

36:02.367 --> 36:05.315
storm's upon us.

36:05.317 --> 36:07.124
- It's time.
- You've held off

36:07.127 --> 36:09.505
this tentacle shit head
for weeks. Just give it

36:09.508 --> 36:11.685
one more push. Drink it.

36:14.771 --> 36:16.712
- Fight it.
- It... it...

36:16.714 --> 36:18.590
it won't... won't let me.

36:18.592 --> 36:20.869
- Waverly...
- Wynonna!

36:20.871 --> 36:23.953
Remember when you made me drink grape
soda 'til it came out of my nose?

36:23.955 --> 36:26.098
Yeah!

36:29.587 --> 36:32.534
Open your mouth! Open it!

36:32.536 --> 36:35.450
OK!

36:35.452 --> 36:38.031
Drink!

36:38.033 --> 36:40.378
Drink it! Come on!

36:40.380 --> 36:42.389
Swallow! OK!

36:51.743 --> 36:54.155
Oh!

36:59.152 --> 37:01.195
Mikshun...

37:01.197 --> 37:04.278
I'd say make your peace...

37:04.280 --> 37:07.194
but I hope you never find any.

37:17.889 --> 37:20.268
It is done.

37:23.286 --> 37:26.301
We're just gonna take your word for it.

37:45.443 --> 37:48.190
Oh, Waverly. Get up. Sh.

37:48.192 --> 37:50.402
Whoa.

37:50.404 --> 37:53.965
That was so New Year's 2012.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.955
I can't believe I
ordered you to shoot her.

37:59.957 --> 38:02.369
I almost did it, too.

38:02.371 --> 38:05.352
I would shoot anybody for you.

38:08.940 --> 38:11.588
That's really sweet.

38:24.797 --> 38:28.080
Come on.

38:28.082 --> 38:32.241
- Let's get her in the house.
- Thank you for saving our girl.

38:32.244 --> 38:34.180
That thing took Willa.

38:34.182 --> 38:36.560
Wasn't letting it get Waverly.

38:36.562 --> 38:38.472
I knew you'd rescue me.

38:38.474 --> 38:40.449
All I did was bring a flask.

38:40.451 --> 38:42.695
It's...

38:42.697 --> 38:45.477
it's just standard Earp
operating procedure.

38:45.479 --> 38:48.796
Yeah.

38:48.798 --> 38:51.477
You said some nasty things.

38:51.479 --> 38:53.857
Well, that was the demon talking.

38:53.859 --> 38:56.036
I don't believe all of it.

38:57.847 --> 39:00.226
Wait, what do you mean, "all of it"?

39:06.864 --> 39:09.042
Oh, Jeremy!

39:09.044 --> 39:11.499
Jeeze. Back so soon, huh?

39:11.502 --> 39:13.801
Yes. Uh, were you using the
industrial cleaners in here?

39:13.803 --> 39:16.553
'Cause that is gonna trigger
my eczema something awful.

39:16.556 --> 39:18.975
Hey. Look, man. I gotta tell
you something, all right?

39:18.978 --> 39:22.798
- No, me first.
- Lucado is dead.

39:22.801 --> 39:24.662
Huh.

39:24.664 --> 39:27.511
Well, we gotta formulate a strategy

39:27.513 --> 39:29.992
- on how to approach HQ, so...
- No, no. OK, about that.

39:29.994 --> 39:32.339
The place was, um...

39:32.341 --> 39:34.772
empty when I got there.

39:34.775 --> 39:36.777
Excuse me?

39:36.780 --> 39:40.785
Dolls... all of Black Badge is gone.

39:57.484 --> 39:58.976
If you're expecting me

39:58.978 --> 40:00.987
to say I'm sorry, I
was just doing my job.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.338
What exactly

40:04.340 --> 40:06.651
- is your job, Ewan?
- Protecting the innocent.

40:06.653 --> 40:09.602
- Control the Triangle.
- The Ghost River Triangle?

40:09.604 --> 40:12.048
Where the hell have you guys been?

40:12.050 --> 40:13.959
Heh. Yeah,

40:13.961 --> 40:16.105
well, it used to be a lot clearer.

40:16.107 --> 40:18.786
We've lost a lot of good
men ever since your sister

40:18.788 --> 40:21.568
crossed the boundary. Opened
the gateway to the Sanctuary.

40:21.570 --> 40:24.686
So just so there's no
more misunderstandings,

40:24.688 --> 40:26.697
that was my other sister.

40:26.699 --> 40:29.043
The rightful Heir.

40:29.045 --> 40:31.223
Shot her myself...

40:31.225 --> 40:33.234
to make sure it was over.

40:33.236 --> 40:36.250
It's not.

40:40.709 --> 40:42.887
So...

40:42.889 --> 40:45.636
The Order, eh?

40:48.587 --> 40:51.503
A colleague of mine
suggested we could be allies.

40:55.995 --> 40:58.106
I have enough friends.

40:58.108 --> 41:00.754
Well, that's perfect then, 'cause
I wasn't asking to be friends.

41:04.073 --> 41:05.781
Just take care of my briefcase...

41:05.783 --> 41:08.061
for now.

41:18.354 --> 41:20.360
I thought you were staying at Nicole's?

41:20.362 --> 41:22.299
Yeah. No. I, uh...

41:22.301 --> 41:24.640
I needed to pick something up in town.

41:27.150 --> 41:29.491
Wynonna, um...

41:29.493 --> 41:31.498
when the demon jumped back into me,

41:31.500 --> 41:34.843
it was different. It told me things...

41:34.845 --> 41:37.419
- about you.
- So what,

41:37.421 --> 41:40.963
now you know all my secrets?

41:40.965 --> 41:43.406
I'm not sure even you know this one yet.

41:57.222 --> 41:59.896
You OK in there?

42:02.306 --> 42:04.345
You know, I'm here for you...

42:04.347 --> 42:06.386
now and forever.

42:09.263 --> 42:11.297
Wynonna?

42:14.011 --> 42:17.272
What exactly did Mikshun tell you?

42:17.274 --> 42:19.725
Um, it...

42:19.727 --> 42:20.884
said your body

42:20.887 --> 42:23.472
wasn't an ideal fit.

42:23.474 --> 42:25.764
It was too crowded.
