I don't believe this.

13:41.462 --> 13:45.165
I know how you feel,
but it's not brain Cancer.

13:45.232 --> 13:47.234
Look, you're gonna
be all right.

13:47.301 --> 13:49.536
Thanks for the memories.

13:49.603 --> 13:51.505
Janice!

13:53.040 --> 13:55.376

for a minute?

13:55.442 --> 13:57.277

13:57.344 --> 13:59.546

as bad as I feel.

14:01.448 --> 14:03.417
I've been pretty busy.

14:03.484 --> 14:05.452
I didn't get any sleep
last night.

14:05.519 --> 14:08.322
<i>You've been up all night?
Uh-huh.</i>

14:08.389 --> 14:11.492
You've been up all night,
and I let you hook me up
to this?

14:11.558 --> 14:14.161
<i>I looked in on you
last night.
[ whirring stops ]</i>

14:14.228 --> 14:17.097
I think I like you better
when you're sleeping.

14:17.164 --> 14:21.301
<i>This doesn't hurt at all.
Mm-Mmm.
It's just like an x-Ray.</i>

14:21.368 --> 14:25.406
I'm thinking about doing
a report on you medical guys
when I get out of here.

14:25.472 --> 14:30.177
-What kind of report?
-An expose, now that I see how
things really work around here.

14:30.244 --> 14:33.614
Are you taking a course
in cynicism at that fancy
finishing school of yours?

14:33.680 --> 14:36.350
It's not a finishing school.
It's a prep school.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.419
Oh, I see. A prep school.

14:38.485 --> 14:42.289
<i>Where they take you on
teen tours in south America.
That's right.</i>

14:42.356 --> 14:45.959
They should have
taught you not to buy
from a street vendor.

14:46.026 --> 14:48.195
How do you know anything
about south America?

14:48.262 --> 14:51.899
I've been there,
and I didn't get sick.

14:53.067 --> 14:55.502
Smile for the camera.

14:56.703 --> 14:58.672
What were
Spencer's numbers
last night?

14:58.739 --> 15:01.809

15:09.817 --> 15:13.187
I heard Dr. Auschlander's
got cancer.
Yeah. Liver.

15:13.253 --> 15:16.690
How long's he got?
He's the liver specialist,
not me.

15:16.757 --> 15:19.760
Pretty ironic isn't it,
Dr. Westphall?
What's that?

15:19.827 --> 15:23.564
Dr. Auschlander's one of the
top liver men in the world and
he gets hit with liver cancer.

15:23.630 --> 15:26.533
It's a shame.
I think we can
save the eulogies.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.403
Knowing Daniel auschlander,
he'll probably outlive
all of us.

15:31.271 --> 15:33.273
Dr. Cavanero.

15:33.340 --> 15:35.476
What is it, Luther?
I've been looking for you.

15:35.542 --> 15:38.879
You better talk
to that patient of yours--
That animal Henry Smith.

15:38.946 --> 15:41.448
Look, Luther,
I know he gave you
a hard time last week--

15:41.515 --> 15:45.352
Hard time? The next time
he comes at me with That
wild look in his eyes--

15:45.419 --> 15:48.021
PATIENT or no patient--
I'm gonna shoot him.

15:48.088 --> 15:50.524
I don't have time for this.
You don't have time for it?

15:50.591 --> 15:54.628
I just spent the last 20
minutes in physical therapy,
waitin' for him.

15:54.695 --> 15:56.697
He didn't show up
this morning?
No.

15:56.764 --> 15:59.900
The next time
he has an appointment,
he better be there or else.

15:59.967 --> 16:02.002
I mean,
my time ain't cheap.

16:02.069 --> 16:06.306
In fact, if it was up to me,
Henry Smith would Not
be in a hospital!

16:06.373 --> 16:09.643
He'd be in a prison!
The man's an animal.

16:11.412 --> 16:14.214
<i>Excuse me. Do you know
where Mr. Smith is?</i>

16:14.281 --> 16:17.251
Ain't nobody been in that bed

16:30.597 --> 16:32.299

Anemia, thrombophlebitis,

You can't miss him.
Where is he?
324.

16:38.038 --> 16:40.641
He's not there.
Maybe he's
in the bathroom.

16:40.707 --> 16:43.811
- For the past 12 hours?
- Maybe he walked out.

16:43.877 --> 16:46.113
I doubt it.
His clothes are still
in the room.

16:46.180 --> 16:49.783
- Where does he live?
I'll give a call.
- Roxbury State.

16:49.850 --> 16:53.487
- The mental hospital?
- You got it. Find him.

17:03.530 --> 17:05.465
Hey, Robin! Jasmine!

17:05.531 --> 17:08.035
<i>It was a tough call.
The guy was in atrial flutter.</i>

17:08.102 --> 17:11.271
Ventricular Response:
150 a minute. Blood Pressure:
40 over zilch.

17:11.338 --> 17:13.574
The guy was, uh,
hemodynamically
compromised.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.609
So what'd you do?
Freddie Buffalo comes
charging through the ward.

17:16.676 --> 17:19.445
Freddie who?
You know, two pink eyes,
blue tongue.

17:19.512 --> 17:22.516
Freddie says,
"give me a defibrillator.
We have a very sick man here."

17:22.583 --> 17:26.420
He takes the paddles,
puts it on the guy's chest,
hits him at a critical point.

17:26.487 --> 17:28.422
Highly compromised
Ventricle.

17:28.489 --> 17:32.493
He hit him at a point in the
cycle when he shouldn't 'cause
he didn't push the sync button.

17:32.559 --> 17:37.364
Freddie didn't want to wait.
The guy goes into V-Fib,
so he zaps him five times.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.833
By the fifth time,
the guy goes into asystole.

17:39.900 --> 17:41.869
I say,
"Okay, call the Arrest.
Call the triple."

17:41.935 --> 17:45.606
I tell the nurse to ring it up.
She loves it-- Life or death,
going for all the bananas.

17:45.672 --> 17:47.941

Nah, we brought him back.

17:48.008 --> 17:50.944
- Any triples last night?
- One.

17:51.011 --> 17:54.848
- Did he make it?
- Nope. White!

I'd cover for you.

Looking a bit weathered.

- Drop dead.
- Okay.

- Not dead, Missing.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.350

about this?

19:03.417 --> 19:06.286
No. Only the staff,
the patients,
the immediate families.

19:06.353 --> 19:10.624
My guess is that
he's probably running one
of the departments by now.

19:10.691 --> 19:13.660
Check Gynecology.
That's where I'd go
after being locked up.

of your liver scan.

There's an abscess
on your liver.

So, what are you
going to do now?

19:59.306 --> 20:02.910

20:05.045 --> 20:07.047
Okay.

20:07.114 --> 20:10.284
I need to get some tissue
from your liver.

20:10.350 --> 20:14.188
Once we examine that tissue,
we'll know how to treat
your abscess.

20:14.254 --> 20:16.290
Do you follow me?

20:16.356 --> 20:19.293
This biopsy--
will it hurt?

20:19.359 --> 20:21.695
No. Promise.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.699
I just want you to know
that I wear bikinis, so I
don't want any biopsy scars.

20:25.766 --> 20:28.502
No scars. It's very simple.
One shot from a needle.

20:29.870 --> 20:32.306
So when are you
gonna do it?

20:32.372 --> 20:35.042
Well, we've got to get
your parents' permission first.

20:35.109 --> 20:38.312

Well, we're all in
for a treat.

20:38.379 --> 20:41.482

come up to Boston.

You're smiling now, but wait--
She's gonna flip out.

20:45.452 --> 20:48.122
It was bad enough
the school had to tell her
I'm in the hospital.

20:48.188 --> 20:50.057
She thinks I've got
the flu or something,

20:50.124 --> 20:52.726
but this biopsy Stuff's
gonna scare the pants
off her.

20:52.793 --> 20:56.764
Well, now you understand
what's going on, we'll have you
explain it to her.

20:56.830 --> 21:01.001
A lot of good that will do.
Can't you just ask the school
for my permission?

21:01.068 --> 21:03.337
No. Sorry. We gotta
tell your mother.

21:03.404 --> 21:05.506

25:09.616 --> 25:11.552
What's the problem?
[ exhales ]

25:11.618 --> 25:15.355
my patient, Sandy malin--
I reviewed her this morning
at grand Rounds.

25:15.422 --> 25:19.426
She came in two days ago.
She was vomiting. She couldn't
hold any food down.

25:19.493 --> 25:22.396
I took her case history.
She'd been in south America
this summer.

25:22.463 --> 25:25.299
I made a diagnosis
of dysentery, ran a liver scan.
It showed an abscess.

25:25.365 --> 25:27.935
And now I see she's down
on the board for surgery
tomorrow Morning.

25:28.001 --> 25:31.472
For your information, doctor,
it is routine to surgically
remove an Abscess.

25:31.538 --> 25:35.542
Yeah? For your information,
if you cut through the abscessed
wall, and it's amoebic,

25:35.609 --> 25:38.445
the parasites could spread,
and she could conceivably die.

25:38.512 --> 25:40.514
Did you order
a liver biopsy?

25:40.581 --> 25:42.716
Yes. I called her parents
and got their permission.

25:42.783 --> 25:45.285
Dr. Robinson called 'em back
and got their permission to cut.

25:45.352 --> 25:47.287
Is Sandy on the board
for surgery?

25:47.354 --> 25:49.523
Halpern's got her in
for first thing tomorrow.

25:49.590 --> 25:52.126
Anybody bother to tell Sandy
she's supposed to be operated
on tomorrow morning,

25:52.192 --> 25:54.194
or were you just gonna
walk in and wheel her out?

25:54.261 --> 25:57.598
- All right, Jack.
- No, it's wrong,
and I don't like it!

25:57.664 --> 26:01.168
I'm not prepared to see some
prima Donna surgeon come in--
now, wait a minute!

26:01.235 --> 26:03.537
That's enough!
That's enough!
Stop it!

26:06.907 --> 26:09.977
I think we can wait
till we get the results
from the liver biopsy.

26:10.044 --> 26:12.479
I don't see the point.
I'd appreciate it.

26:13.981 --> 26:15.949
Put it that way, Okay.

26:17.418 --> 26:19.820
Thank you.
Jack.

26:19.887 --> 26:23.223
You were late again
for grand rounds.

26:23.290 --> 26:26.994
Sorry. I got hung up
with a patient.

26:27.061 --> 26:29.296
Another patient?
Yeah.

26:30.831 --> 26:33.934
First-Year residents
can't afford to miss
grand rounds, Jack.

26:34.001 --> 26:36.503
And they can't
cover for everyone,
not even their friends.

26:43.877 --> 26:47.848
I don't care if it's the biggest
thing to hit the fashion
industry since hot pants.

26:47.915 --> 26:50.217
We need 300 more
blue scrubs.

26:53.654 --> 26:58.225
Well, Marty, it's not my problem
that you can get $28 apiece
for them retail.

27:00.127 --> 27:03.263
Thirty-Five midtown?
I told you.

27:03.330 --> 27:06.100
All right.
What about green?

27:06.166 --> 27:08.669
Good. All right.
He can get us 200 green.
Three.

27:08.736 --> 27:11.739
No, we need more.
We need 300.

27:11.805 --> 27:14.842
Well, I can't worry
about Boston general,
Marty.

27:14.908 --> 27:18.779
They can buy
their scrubs at Filene's.
They can afford blue.

27:18.846 --> 27:21.815
All right. 300 Green
tomorrow morning Early.
Thank you.

27:21.882 --> 27:24.651
All right, Ramon. You're
gonna get your scrubs.
Thanks.

27:24.718 --> 27:28.489
Hi. What can I do for you?
Listen, we got a real
problem on the floor.

27:28.555 --> 27:31.558
Half of ward 5
is panic-Stricken
over this Henry Smith Guy.

27:31.625 --> 27:34.428
Who's Henry Smith?
Dr. Cavanero's patient.

27:34.495 --> 27:36.764
<i>He's been missing
since last night.
Missing?</i>

27:36.830 --> 27:39.733
- That's right. Missing.
- What's he look like?

27:39.800 --> 27:44.438
Well, from what I hear,
he's, like, 7'2", 380 and mean.
Have you seen him?

27:45.672 --> 27:48.342
If I had,
I'd remember,
wouldn't I?

27:48.409 --> 27:51.612
- Okay. Tell Dr. Cavanero
I want to see her.
- Okay.

27:52.679 --> 27:55.149
Open? Closed?
Don't matter.

27:55.215 --> 27:59.720
[ muttering ]

27:59.787 --> 28:02.556
what are you looking
so happy about?

28:02.623 --> 28:04.625
I've been vindicated.

28:04.691 --> 28:07.428
I got the results
of your liver biopsy--

28:07.494 --> 28:10.230
amoebas one,
bacteria nothing.

28:10.297 --> 28:15.035
Meaning?
Meaning that you're not gonna
be captured by surgery.

28:15.102 --> 28:18.272
I get to keep
treating you myself.

28:18.338 --> 28:21.542
I'm gonna get you started
on some medication.

28:21.608 --> 28:24.445
Metronidazole,
in case you're interested.

28:24.511 --> 28:28.182
You should be feeling better
in a few days and out of here
in a couple of Weeks.

28:28.248 --> 28:30.417
Great.
Right.

28:30.484 --> 28:32.986
Were you really
in south America,
Dr. Morrison?

28:33.053 --> 28:35.422
Actually, it was mexico.

28:35.489 --> 28:38.025
I was in medical school
there for two years.

28:38.092 --> 28:40.961
Why'd you go there?
I had lousy grades
in college.

28:41.028 --> 28:43.864
Did you speak spanish?
Not a word.

28:43.931 --> 28:46.200
I had to buy two sets
of Textbooks.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.736
After two years,
I came back,
finished up here.

28:48.802 --> 28:52.306
So do you like
being a doctor?
I don't know yet.

28:52.372 --> 28:54.708
Talk to me
when I'm awake.

28:54.775 --> 28:57.444
All right.
Let's get you started on
your medication.

28:57.511 --> 29:00.681
Get you better
and out of my hair.

29:00.748 --> 29:04.585
- By the way, your mother's
coming here today.
- Great.

29:07.888 --> 29:09.823
Uh, Dr. Morrison?

29:09.890 --> 29:13.560
You did say you're married,
didn't you?

29:13.627 --> 29:17.498
Come on.
You're only 15 years old,
for crying out loud.

29:17.564 --> 29:20.701
And just how long has
this Mr. Smith been missing?

29:20.768 --> 29:22.703
Since last Night.

29:22.770 --> 29:26.640
Uh-huh. I imagine you told
the charge nurse, who, in turn,

29:26.707 --> 29:28.675
passed this information
on to someone else.
Yes.

29:28.742 --> 29:30.677
Who, in turn--
I guess so.

29:30.744 --> 29:33.814
It seems to me that
everyone in the hospital knew
that this man was missing...

29:33.881 --> 29:35.816
except security.

29:35.883 --> 29:38.052
I didn't see any reason
to get hysterical.

29:38.118 --> 29:41.655
-You weren't thinking, Cavanero.
-I thought I could handle it.

29:41.722 --> 29:43.690
What's the trouble,
Annie?

29:44.825 --> 29:46.927
Dr. Westphall,
there's no trouble.

29:46.994 --> 29:51.131
Come on.
A patient is missing, and
you don't notify security?

29:51.198 --> 29:53.534
Your job is to treat him,
you know, not to find him.

29:53.600 --> 29:55.936
Now, what the hell's
going on here?

29:56.003 --> 29:59.006
Did you see the white Sheet
on Henry Smith?
No, I didn't.

29:59.073 --> 30:01.175
The man hasn't had
a good day in his life.

30:01.241 --> 30:04.978
No home, no family,
nothing. A nobody.

30:05.045 --> 30:08.115
The kind of trash
you see washed up
on the streets every day,

30:08.182 --> 30:11.185
<i>but you never Stop to look
because it makes you
too uncomfortable.</i>

30:11.251 --> 30:15.155
Henry Smith is my Patient.
He's my responsibility.

30:16.690 --> 30:20.761
Dr. Cavanero, we are
all aware of your skills
as a physician,

30:20.828 --> 30:22.830
and they're considerable.

30:22.896 --> 30:26.066
But none of us is expected
to handle everything,
not even a woman.

30:29.336 --> 30:32.873
- Anything else, Dr. Westphall?
- Mm-Hmm. Call security now.

30:38.812 --> 30:41.181

She's got a puncture
wound to her gut.
Call surgery.

31:02.970 --> 31:05.806
Tell them to Bump the board
and get us a seat.
And move it!

31:05.873 --> 31:08.442
What the hell
happened to this woman?
She's a train wreck.

31:08.509 --> 31:12.312
Terrorist set off a bomb
in a bank.

31:12.379 --> 31:14.748
She's the lucky one.
Two people died.

31:14.815 --> 31:16.950
What happened
to the terrorist?

31:17.017 --> 31:19.486
Weinstein's working
on him in 4.

31:22.990 --> 31:25.859
<i>Yes?</i>

31:25.926 --> 31:28.662
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Westphall?
Come on in, Jack.

31:31.698 --> 31:34.401
This is mrs. Malin,
Sandy's mother.
Jack Morrison.

31:34.468 --> 31:36.670
Well, hi. You've got
a terrific daughter.

31:36.737 --> 31:39.039
She thinks the world
of you too.

31:39.106 --> 31:42.142
I've just been
explaining to mrs. Malin
what's wrong with Sandy.

31:42.209 --> 31:44.978
This really has been
quite a shock.

31:45.045 --> 31:48.215
Not only was I unaware that
Sandy was in the hospital,

31:48.282 --> 31:50.884
which, knowing Sandy,
shouldn't surprise me,

31:50.951 --> 31:54.421
but she got back
from south America
over six weeks ago,

31:54.488 --> 31:56.824
and she's been Perfectly fine
ever Since.

31:56.890 --> 32:01.361
Well, these parasites
can lie dormant for a while
before becoming active.

32:01.428 --> 32:05.299
We should be able to treat the
problem now, and Sandy Should be
out within a week or two.

32:05.365 --> 32:08.702
Uh, Jack,
mrs. Malin wants to move Sandy
to Boston general Tomorrow.

32:10.704 --> 32:12.639
Why?

32:12.706 --> 32:15.242
Well, our doctor
in Maryland told us...

32:15.309 --> 32:19.113
that Boston general is a newer,
more modern hospital.

32:20.614 --> 32:24.451
Mrs. Malin,
her care won't be any better
there than here.

32:24.518 --> 32:27.054
I promise you that.
Dr. Morrison, please.

32:27.121 --> 32:31.525
I appreciate all that
you've done for Sandy.
You have many patients.

32:31.592 --> 32:35.362
I have only one daughter,
and I must do what I think
is Best.

32:35.429 --> 32:37.364
<i>What's best
for your daughter--</i>

32:37.431 --> 32:40.801
There's no problem, Mrs. Malin.
We'll have Sandy moved Tomorrow.

32:40.868 --> 32:42.803
Thank you.
Bye.

32:42.870 --> 32:45.506
Bye. Thank you.
Bye.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.677
Why did you
let her do that?

32:50.744 --> 32:52.746
Because I'm not
Sandy's parent.

32:52.813 --> 32:56.216
But there was
no reason for it.
It's not personal, Jack.

32:56.283 --> 32:58.652
Yeah, it's personal.
She's my patient.

32:58.719 --> 33:02.089
I've admitted her,
diagnosed her, stayed up nights
taking care of her.

33:02.156 --> 33:04.558
It's personal to me.
I care about her.

33:04.625 --> 33:09.129
Then I suggest you talk to her
and make the transition as easy
as possible, all right?

You forgot to turn it in?

36:58.092 --> 37:00.894
You forgot
to turn it in?

37:12.673 --> 37:15.075
This isn't an ordinary
hit and run.

37:15.142 --> 37:18.812
This isn't a back alley
knife wound. This is kismet.
Kismet?

37:18.879 --> 37:22.516

thoughts on how best to deal
with the terrorist situation.

37:24.585 --> 37:27.688
Mark has called
a press conference
for tomorrow morning, 7:30.

37:27.755 --> 37:31.225
Why would you want to do
a thing like that?
Why?

37:31.291 --> 37:34.495
Because that slug
is a headliner,

37:34.561 --> 37:37.030
and god knows
we can use the publicity.

37:37.097 --> 37:40.100
I was under the impression
that that slug was a patient
of ours, mark,

37:40.167 --> 37:42.102
not some in-House
celebrity.

37:42.169 --> 37:46.073
No? Well, tell me,
was the vermin that shot
that judge last month--

37:46.140 --> 37:49.977
Was he just a patient?
Come on!

37:50.044 --> 37:52.346
Boston General
Made certain...

37:52.413 --> 37:55.783
that Everybody and his mother
knew They were treating
that little scum.

37:55.849 --> 37:59.686
You couldn't flip a channel
without seeing
mousy Jimmy O'Toole.

37:59.753 --> 38:04.058
- Who's Jimmy O'Toole?
- The hospital spokesman!
Where has he been?

38:04.124 --> 38:08.028
Why don't we hire
an advertising agency
and do a whole campaign?

38:10.064 --> 38:12.099
You know, Donald?

38:12.166 --> 38:14.568
You can be a very
negative-Thinking person.

call this place?

38:17.137 --> 38:20.474
Not st. Eligius.
St. Elsewhere.

A dumping ground, a place

Now somebody around here is
trying to Garner a little
goodwill publicity...

38:30.918 --> 38:33.921
and possibly
raise a few bucks
for this rathole,

38:33.987 --> 38:35.989

is problems.

38:36.056 --> 38:38.525

No, no. I mean it!

38:38.592 --> 38:42.563

about here is initiative.

38:42.629 --> 38:47.101
They said it couldn't be done,
but I secured the new clocks.

they all read the same time...

in the parking lot?

38:57.745 --> 38:59.747
Where's the money
coming for that?

38:59.813 --> 39:04.785
If my going on camera
can get the job done,
I say let's do it.

39:04.852 --> 39:07.721
Mark's been kind enough
to offer his service
as a spokesman.

39:07.788 --> 39:11.959
Now, I, uh--
I don't want to rain on
anybody else's parade.

39:12.025 --> 39:15.262

also be there.

39:16.363 --> 39:19.500
Sure.
Good. Great.

39:21.135 --> 39:23.871
By the way, Donald, uh,
what'll you be wearing?

39:25.706 --> 39:29.143
- Oh, something simple.
- Right.

39:29.209 --> 39:31.812
I have a navy blue tie,
if you're interested.

39:31.879 --> 39:33.914
That'd be perfect.
I appreciate it.

39:33.981 --> 39:36.884
My pleasure.
I'll be going red.

of this joint, huh?

39:53.200 --> 39:55.669

she'd cause trouble.

39:58.405 --> 40:01.742
God, the problems.
There always are.

It doesn't matter
what I want, what I think.
It's always best for me.

40:05.846 --> 40:08.849
I'll tell you
what I told her--
I'm not leaving.

40:08.916 --> 40:11.919
If she wants me out,
she can call an AMBULANCE,

drag me out...

40:14.555 --> 40:17.324

That's the only way
I'm leaving.

Look, Sandy.

40:23.864 --> 40:26.533
We're friends, right?

40:26.600 --> 40:29.069
So Let's talk straight
to each other.

40:31.872 --> 40:35.376
Your mother didn't come up here
to give you a hard time.

40:35.442 --> 40:37.745
She didn't.

40:37.811 --> 40:41.448
She came up here
because she loves you
and cares about you.

40:44.451 --> 40:47.888
She thinks,
like a lot of people,

40:47.955 --> 40:50.424
that newer and bigger
is better.

40:53.026 --> 40:55.763
I don't know about better,

40:55.829 --> 40:59.500
but Boston General's
certainly newer and bigger.

40:59.566 --> 41:02.202
You say that because
my mom wants you to.

41:03.971 --> 41:06.440
No, I say it
'cause it's the truth.

41:09.610 --> 41:12.946

you liked me.

41:13.013 --> 41:15.849

Whether you leave today
or a week from now,

41:20.454 --> 41:22.790
I've done
all I can do for you.

41:24.758 --> 41:27.227
So, you're telling me
to leave?

41:28.395 --> 41:30.297
Mm-hmm.

41:32.666 --> 41:35.302
Okay.
Then I will.

41:42.876 --> 41:45.345
You're not leaving

one thing though.

I'm not going out

anymore.
