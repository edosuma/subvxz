SCREENPLAY: HIROSHI TAKAHASHI

DIRECTED BY HIDEO NAKADA

01:34.011 --> 01:38.724
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 5TH

01:39.183 --> 01:43.479
A primary school boy was on holiday
down in Izu with his family.

01:44.313 --> 01:46.816
He wanted to go out and play,

01:46.899 --> 01:50.736
but there was a TV show
he didn't want to miss.

01:50.820 --> 01:53.739
So he recorded it on the VCR
in their room.

01:53.823 --> 01:56.200
But the channels down there
are different from Tokyo's.

01:56.283 --> 02:00.454
No station there uses that channel,
so it should've been blank.

02:00.579 --> 02:04.542
But when he played it back at home,
there was a woman on the screen.

02:06.293 --> 02:08.878
"You will die in one week," she said.

02:08.963 --> 02:12.007
The kid stopped the tape,
and then the phone rang.

02:12.091 --> 02:13.968
"You saw it."

02:14.677 --> 02:18.013
And a week later, the kid died.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.485
What's wrong, Tomoko?

02:34.446 --> 02:38.242
- Who told you that?
- Everybody's talking about it.

02:38.325 --> 02:41.078
- Did Yoko?
- No, not her.

02:45.207 --> 02:46.709
What is it?

02:50.963 --> 02:54.175
I saw a weird video the other day.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.055
- Where?
- With Yoko and the rest.

03:00.181 --> 03:03.809
Did all of you really go
and spend the night somewhere?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.311
Nothing happened!

03:14.945 --> 03:16.322
But that night...

03:17.781 --> 03:22.286
...Iwata found this weird video,
and we all watched it.

03:26.165 --> 03:27.875
How was it "weird"?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.174
It's hard to say.

03:35.257 --> 03:38.344
Just after it ended,
someone phoned us.

03:39.762 --> 03:41.764
It was some kind of prank call.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.440
How awful.

03:55.903 --> 03:57.905
Everyone else had heard that story.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.035
Today it'll be one week.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.088
Come on!

04:15.506 --> 04:17.716
You're just trying to scare me.

04:23.180 --> 04:25.015
I had you going!

04:25.140 --> 04:28.644
- I don't believe you!
- You're so easy to fool.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.313
But did you really
spend the night there?

04:34.900 --> 04:36.902
- So what happened?
- I'm not telling!

04:36.986 --> 04:39.363
- Confess!
- It's a secret.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.812
Is it true?

05:22.740 --> 05:24.366
Masami!

05:31.248 --> 05:32.791
Masami!

05:48.432 --> 05:49.975
Hello?

05:54.104 --> 05:56.065
She's right here.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.736
Hello?

06:05.866 --> 06:07.368
Oh, Mum!

06:10.829 --> 06:12.414
A friend came over.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.961
Got it. Yeah, yeah.

06:22.174 --> 06:25.135
Extra innings in baseball.
They'll be late.

06:30.933 --> 06:32.726
Don't scare me like that.

06:32.810 --> 06:36.480
Look who's talking.
I'm going to tell everyone tomorrow.

06:38.273 --> 06:41.652
I'm going to the toilet.
Don't go upstairs without me.

06:41.777 --> 06:43.112
Sure.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.648
There's this "video curse"
everyone's talking about.

08:01.773 --> 08:02.900
Yes.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.818
Have you heard
what kind of video it is?

08:04.943 --> 08:06.195
Yes.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.866
- Don't look at the camera.
- Sorry.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.284
Once more.

08:14.870 --> 08:17.039
Have you heard
what kind of video it is?

08:17.122 --> 08:21.210
I heard that suddenly
there's this scary woman

08:21.335 --> 08:24.755
who says,
"You will die in one week."

08:24.880 --> 08:27.382
They say if you watch late night TV,
she appears.

08:27.508 --> 08:30.344
And then the phone rings.

08:31.470 --> 08:34.389
Late night TV? What channel?

08:34.515 --> 08:38.644
I heard it was on a local channel
down in Izu.

08:38.727 --> 08:39.227
In Izu?

08:40.979 --> 08:44.942
And is there really someone
who died a week later?

08:45.025 --> 08:47.778
It's no one that we know.

08:52.783 --> 08:54.117
What is it?

08:54.243 --> 08:57.246
A high school student I know told me,

08:57.329 --> 09:01.792
a girl who'd seen it
died on a date with her boyfriend.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.211
An accident?

09:04.336 --> 09:06.713
They were found dead
in a parked car.

09:06.838 --> 09:09.132
He'd seen the video, too.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.761
It was in the newspaper
two or three days ago.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.847
Do you know what school?

09:15.973 --> 09:20.978
No. My friend heard it
from a friend of hers.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.859
- Ms Asakawa. Here you go.
- Thanks.

09:31.446 --> 09:33.949
About ten years ago,

09:34.074 --> 09:37.828
a pop idol killed herself,
and people saw her ghost on TV.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.789
Yeah, but everyone you ask
about this one

09:40.914 --> 09:42.874
talks about the Izu Peninsula.

09:42.958 --> 09:45.294
Well, maybe that's where
this one started.

09:46.211 --> 09:48.213
Where's the woman from?

09:48.297 --> 09:50.048
Further west, in Gifu.

09:50.173 --> 09:53.927
That was after a big
traffic accident down there.

09:54.011 --> 09:55.679
A big accident?

09:56.513 --> 10:00.142
These stories get started
when people die horrible deaths.

10:00.267 --> 10:03.103
- So what happened in Izu?
- I don't know.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.188
Anyway, I'm off. Goodnight.

10:05.314 --> 10:06.857
Goodnight.

10:29.046 --> 10:31.381
YOUNG COUPLE
FOUND DEAD IN CAR

10:34.384 --> 10:37.387
A 19-YEAR-OLD TOKYO BOY AND
A 17-YEAR-OLD YOKOHAMA GIRL

10:37.512 --> 10:40.432
FOUND DEAD IN CAR
ON MORNING OF SEPTEMBER 6TH

10:49.191 --> 10:51.193
Take care of it, will you?

10:52.778 --> 10:55.822
Weren't you leaving early today?

10:55.947 --> 10:57.949
Okazaki, will you do something for me?

10:58.075 --> 11:00.619
Can you find this high school for me?

11:00.744 --> 11:02.996
- Sure.
- Call me when you find it.

11:31.233 --> 11:32.776
Yoichi!

11:35.821 --> 11:37.823
You're changed already!

11:37.948 --> 11:40.033
I put your clothes out, too.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.285
We need to hurry.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.043
- Did Grandpa call?
- No.

11:53.797 --> 11:56.341
Why did Tomo-Chan die?

11:58.719 --> 12:01.888
Some strange disease, I guess.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.975
Zip me up.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.774
Do kids die, too?

12:15.068 --> 12:17.070
Sometimes they get sick.

12:18.196 --> 12:23.785
But don't talk about that
at Aunt Yoshiki's. It's too hard for her.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.915
Tomoko often played with you,
didn't she?

12:45.474 --> 12:47.934
FUNERAL ATTENDEES -
THIS WAY

12:51.313 --> 12:52.856
Dad...

12:55.150 --> 12:59.404
- How's Big Sister?
- She's lying down. Best leave her alone.

13:00.322 --> 13:02.199
I'll go and help.

13:04.242 --> 13:07.829
Yoichi, you come and sit here.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.441
Reiko-Chan.

13:42.739 --> 13:44.741
Does anyone know why Tomoko died?

13:44.866 --> 13:48.745
- No, not me.
- But the police did an autopsy!

13:48.870 --> 13:50.914
But there was no evidence of a crime.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.291
People don't just die like that.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.337
And it's a closed coffin.
Isn't that strange?

15:03.111 --> 15:04.446
Yoichi?

15:06.281 --> 15:08.909
You shouldn't just come in here.

15:17.375 --> 15:19.044
Go downstairs.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.929
Go on.

15:31.348 --> 15:34.392
- Hello?
- It's Okazaki.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.021
I found the name of the high school.

15:39.898 --> 15:42.984
Seikei Academy in Yokohama.

15:44.945 --> 15:46.363
Thank you.

15:55.789 --> 15:59.000
IN LOVING MEMORY
SEIKEI ACADEMY

16:11.721 --> 16:13.640
Excuse me.

16:13.765 --> 16:18.478
Was the girl who died in the car
a friend of yours, too?

16:23.817 --> 16:26.027
If there's anything you know...

16:27.445 --> 16:29.823
They all died the same day.

16:29.906 --> 16:33.785
Yoko and Tomoko.
And Iwata, too, on his motorbike.

16:33.910 --> 16:35.829
They all saw the video.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.747
What video?

16:37.872 --> 16:41.751
Yoko told us they'd all seen
this weird video.

16:41.876 --> 16:44.838
When it was over,
they received a phone call.

16:46.297 --> 16:49.009
Tomoko saw it, too? Where?

16:50.719 --> 16:52.887
They all went and stayed over
somewhere.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.142
The girl who was with Tomoko
when she died...

16:57.934 --> 17:00.311
She went crazy and she's in the hospital.

17:01.021 --> 17:03.773
She won't go anywhere
where there's a TV.

17:08.153 --> 17:13.782
The girl was named Yoko Tsuji, 17,
in her third year at Seikei Academy.

17:14.742 --> 17:18.079
The boy was Tadahiko Nomi, 19,
doing a college prep year.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.833
The car doors were locked.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.401
I've never seen a corpse
that looked like that.

17:49.152 --> 17:50.945
Cause of death?

17:51.029 --> 17:54.824
Unknown.
Their hearts simply stopped.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.995
- Drugs?
- Nothing came up in the autopsy.

18:06.920 --> 18:10.256
They'd just started snogging,
then they just died.

18:12.008 --> 18:14.010
It doesn't make sense.

18:46.709 --> 18:49.754
Yo-Chan was at the funeral.

18:54.175 --> 18:57.178
He used to go upstairs
and play in her room.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.808
Yes, he did.

20:01.868 --> 20:04.162
THE PHOTO SHOP

20:14.756 --> 20:17.342
I found Tomoko dead here.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.722
Tomoko!

21:01.344 --> 21:03.471
IZU PACIFIC LAND

21:05.223 --> 21:06.933
Izu...

21:29.747 --> 21:32.375
I might be late tonight.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.211
Put your supper
in the microwave. Got it?

21:36.087 --> 21:38.756
- Mum?
- Yeah?

21:38.840 --> 21:41.926
Tomoko saw the cursed video.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.307
Why did you say that?

21:48.057 --> 21:50.935
Don't say anything about that
at school, do you hear?

21:51.019 --> 21:52.478
I won't.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.314
I'm off.

22:11.414 --> 22:15.877
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 13TH

22:23.801 --> 22:25.845
IZU PARKWAY

22:29.182 --> 22:31.184
This is crazy!

22:38.024 --> 22:42.320
IZU PACIFIC LAND

25:02.418 --> 25:08.299
"My dad's fat. My mum's fat.
So I'm fat, too."

25:50.049 --> 25:51.842
You're here alone?

25:51.926 --> 25:54.845
Yeah, I'm doing a bit of work.
Erm...

25:58.474 --> 26:02.311
These four people stayed here
on August 29th.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.940
Did you notice anything unusual?

26:06.482 --> 26:10.278
Just a minute, OK?
August 29th...

26:34.844 --> 26:36.178
That tape...

26:37.221 --> 26:38.472
That one.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.267
What tape is it?

26:41.350 --> 26:42.810
This one?

26:45.146 --> 26:47.106
Someone must've left it.

27:52.505 --> 27:55.800
ERUPTION

28:10.189 --> 28:14.193
SADA

29:28.225 --> 29:30.102
One week...

30:11.644 --> 30:16.190
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 14TH

31:06.699 --> 31:08.742
So Yoichi's in school?

31:10.661 --> 31:12.162
Year 1.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.543
So how are you, Ryuji?

31:18.627 --> 31:20.379
Same as always.

31:21.046 --> 31:22.673
What are you doing?

31:23.340 --> 31:25.342
Teaching at a university.

31:31.599 --> 31:34.351
So you said there was a phone call?

31:34.476 --> 31:36.186
Yeah.

31:36.312 --> 31:39.106
So this phone will ring after I see it?

31:39.189 --> 31:41.859
Four people died, all on the same day!

31:41.942 --> 31:44.445
So go to a shrine and get an exorcism!

31:48.282 --> 31:49.950
Take my picture.

31:57.625 --> 31:59.376
Face this way.

32:02.171 --> 32:03.839
Hurry up and take it!

33:23.877 --> 33:25.379
It's over.

33:43.564 --> 33:45.232
No phone call.

33:47.276 --> 33:50.279
Copy this for me.
I'll take a good look at it.

33:51.739 --> 33:53.949
It's not certain death yet.

33:54.074 --> 33:56.577
It's a video. Someone must've made it.

33:57.745 --> 34:01.749
I'll check who stayed there.
Also for pirate broadcasts.

34:06.003 --> 34:10.674
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 15TH

34:28.942 --> 34:30.527
From the Izu bureau.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.154
Thanks.

34:32.279 --> 34:34.614
Why do you want
that list of customers?

34:35.199 --> 34:38.534
Sorry, but I just need to check
something by myself.

35:31.713 --> 35:33.340
Was it you?

35:35.884 --> 35:37.719
Did you do this?

36:04.413 --> 36:06.623
- Sorry I'm late.
- What's wrong?

36:07.708 --> 36:09.001
Nothing.

36:32.858 --> 36:34.526
How did it go?

36:34.610 --> 36:37.279
No one I phoned
had taken a tape to the cabin.

36:37.404 --> 36:41.241
And they all sounded normal,
not like they'd make a tape like this.

36:41.366 --> 36:43.243
Pirate stations?

36:43.368 --> 36:46.413
There's no record of an illegal broadcast
anywhere in Izu.

36:48.081 --> 36:49.875
Here's the copy.

37:03.096 --> 37:04.473
Asakawa...

37:16.276 --> 37:18.779
Have you ever seen this woman?

37:26.620 --> 37:28.080
No.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.978
This shot is weird.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.741
From that angle, the cameraman
should appear in the mirror.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.785
What do you mean?

38:09.746 --> 38:14.167
Well, you could fix it
with special effects, but...

38:20.590 --> 38:22.009
"Eruption..."

38:23.385 --> 38:25.053
Which eruption?

38:31.143 --> 38:33.812
You can't read it on a regular home TV.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.487
Come in.

38:52.372 --> 38:54.750
This is Takano. A student of mine.

38:55.751 --> 38:58.086
This is Asakawa, my ex-wife.

38:59.212 --> 39:01.173
How do you do? I'm Takano.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.508
I'm Asakawa.

39:07.679 --> 39:10.223
Sir, the publisher wants your essay.

39:10.307 --> 39:12.768
Why did they tell you that?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.936
They couldn't get hold of you, sir.

39:16.229 --> 39:17.898
Ask them to extend the deadline a week.

39:17.981 --> 39:20.984
Me? Ask them yourself, sir!

39:21.109 --> 39:22.611
OK, OK...

40:21.378 --> 40:22.963
It's no good.

40:31.805 --> 40:33.723
"Sada."

40:37.811 --> 40:39.646
Is Yoichi all right alone?

40:40.897 --> 40:42.607
He's used to it.

40:44.860 --> 40:48.905
Whoever did this
left a sign subconsciously.

40:49.573 --> 40:51.575
He wants to be stopped.

41:03.712 --> 41:05.046
Wait.

42:17.410 --> 42:20.622
"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine."

42:20.705 --> 42:23.083
Sounds like some sort of saying.

42:24.960 --> 42:28.463
- What does it mean?
- I'll check tomorrow.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.607
...who says,
"You will die in one week'. '

42:47.732 --> 42:51.695
They say if you watch late night TV,
she appears.

42:51.778 --> 42:53.321
And then the phone rings.

42:53.405 --> 42:58.243
THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 16TH

42:58.368 --> 43:01.538
I heard it was on a local channel
down in Izu.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.501
Hello?

43:06.585 --> 43:09.671
I found it.
As I thought, it is a saying.

43:09.754 --> 43:13.049
It's something
about "brine" and "goblins".

43:14.301 --> 43:16.303
A saying from where?

43:16.386 --> 43:19.389
Oshima Island.
There's a volcano, Mt Mihara, there.

43:45.999 --> 43:47.751
Hello, Yoichi?

43:48.710 --> 43:50.545
I'll be late tonight.

43:52.756 --> 43:54.341
You're OK alone?

43:55.300 --> 43:56.843
I'm sorry.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.988
MOUNT MIHARA ERUPTS

44:25.038 --> 44:28.667
Here. But it's a long time ago.

44:34.005 --> 44:36.675
DID LOCAL WOMAN
PREDICT ERUPTION?

44:47.894 --> 44:51.231
- What is it?
- Do you have an Oshima Bureau?

44:51.314 --> 44:53.233
I think so. A correspondent.

44:53.316 --> 44:55.527
Get me the number. Tonight.

44:57.028 --> 45:00.990
- What for?
- You only have four days left.

45:02.867 --> 45:05.328
I'll handle it with your correspondent.

45:07.831 --> 45:09.874
You stay with Yoichi.

45:33.690 --> 45:34.899
Grandpa!

45:34.983 --> 45:37.610
Well, hello.

45:37.694 --> 45:39.028
FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 17TH

45:39.112 --> 45:41.573
- He wants to go fishing with you.
- Is that so?

45:41.698 --> 45:46.035
- Come on, let's go!
- Let's go out fishing!

45:50.874 --> 45:52.667
Grandpa! You've got one!

45:52.751 --> 45:56.045
Aww, he got away!

45:56.129 --> 45:58.173
You're not very good at this!

46:00.300 --> 46:03.011
OK, let's try it again.

46:03.136 --> 46:05.555
Let's fish over here this time.

46:05.638 --> 46:06.973
All right.

46:14.814 --> 46:16.941
You're home.

46:37.212 --> 46:38.505
Hello?

46:38.588 --> 46:42.258
Your man in Oshima says

46:43.843 --> 46:47.430
that our woman is probably
the one who predicted the eruption.

46:47.514 --> 46:50.141
Her name was Shizuko Yamamura.

46:50.225 --> 46:54.395
She threw herself
into the volcano 40 years ago.

46:57.023 --> 47:01.027
- What do we do now?
- Go down there, I guess.

47:01.110 --> 47:03.613
I'll go tomorrow.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.950
Oshima? But I only have
three days left!

47:07.075 --> 47:10.495
I know. And I have four.

47:13.206 --> 47:14.874
I'll call you again.

47:30.765 --> 47:32.559
Is something wrong?

47:34.227 --> 47:37.230
No, just some work.

48:03.506 --> 48:05.174
Auntie.

48:13.141 --> 48:14.642
Yoichi?

48:58.311 --> 49:01.272
Yoichi! Did you bring that here?

49:02.023 --> 49:04.609
You did, didn't you? Why?

49:04.734 --> 49:06.277
Tomo-Chan...

49:09.447 --> 49:12.742
Tomo-Chan told me to.

49:33.513 --> 49:35.139
I was careless.

49:36.349 --> 49:39.143
I sensed something at your place.

49:40.269 --> 49:41.938
I thought it was the video.

49:42.647 --> 49:44.691
It was Tomo-Chan.

49:44.774 --> 49:46.901
She's not Tomoko anymore.

49:48.111 --> 49:50.530
Yoichi can see her, too, then.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.168
It's all my fault, isn't it?

50:05.878 --> 50:10.717
It should've ended
with Tomoko and the others.

50:12.260 --> 50:13.720
I wonder.

50:15.805 --> 50:18.266
Who did the story start with?

50:19.183 --> 50:21.519
Stories like that don't start with anyone.

50:22.812 --> 50:25.148
People feel anxious,
and rumours start flying.

50:26.065 --> 50:27.275
Anxious?

50:27.358 --> 50:32.113
Or people start them,
hoping things will turn out like this.

50:57.013 --> 50:58.639
Mr Hayatsu?

50:58.723 --> 51:01.976
Hello. Sorry you've had to come
all the way out here.

51:02.101 --> 51:03.519
This way.

51:04.854 --> 51:09.150
SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 18TH

51:14.113 --> 51:19.452
The Yamamura family used to run
big fishing crews here.

51:19.869 --> 51:22.205
They're all but out of the business now.

51:23.623 --> 51:26.584
Shizuko's cousin is still alive.

51:26.709 --> 51:28.836
His son and daughter-in-law run an inn.

51:28.920 --> 51:31.339
I've booked you in there for the night.

51:46.312 --> 51:49.232
Why did Shizuko Yamamura
commit suicide?

51:49.315 --> 51:51.067
They say she went crazy.

51:52.110 --> 51:54.445
The newspapers had written
some things about her.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.873
She was famous all over the island
after she predicted the eruption.

52:05.957 --> 52:08.876
It'd always been said
that she had strange powers.

52:08.960 --> 52:11.254
She was what they call a seer.

52:12.004 --> 52:14.048
After that, a professor showed up.

52:14.173 --> 52:16.843
You've heard of him, Heihachiro Ikuma.

52:18.928 --> 52:20.471
Wasn't he fired?

52:21.973 --> 52:26.185
He brought Shizuko to Tokyo
and did experiments on her.

52:26.310 --> 52:28.855
He was trying to prove
the existence of ESP.

52:30.189 --> 52:34.193
The papers built him up,
then tore him down.

52:35.528 --> 52:39.198
The media haven't changed much
in 40 years.

52:40.575 --> 52:42.702
I remember hearing something about it.

52:43.703 --> 52:48.040
But... didn't someone die
during one of the experiments?

52:52.044 --> 52:55.798
Dr Ikuma disappeared
after his university fired him.

52:57.049 --> 52:59.051
I doubt he's still alive.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.305
Even if we found him, then what?

53:03.598 --> 53:05.433
They say Shizuko had a daughter.

53:22.450 --> 53:23.951
Anyone in?

53:27.830 --> 53:30.082
- Hello.
- Welcome.

53:30.208 --> 53:32.376
Right, I'll leave you to it.

53:35.421 --> 53:37.089
This way, please.

53:40.509 --> 53:42.511
Will it be one room?

53:43.679 --> 53:45.348
Separate rooms.

53:50.811 --> 53:52.104
This way.

53:56.317 --> 53:57.443
But...

54:15.670 --> 54:17.004
Please...

54:19.340 --> 54:21.175
Wait, please!

54:21.259 --> 54:23.719
Please tell me about Shizuko!

54:23.844 --> 54:27.807
- I have nothing to say.
- What about her daughter?

54:33.104 --> 54:35.106
There was no daughter.

55:06.512 --> 55:07.930
Not hungry?

55:10.433 --> 55:11.600
No...

55:14.895 --> 55:18.899
When I die, be with me...

55:20.484 --> 55:22.445
Cut it out.

55:22.528 --> 55:23.779
Please!

55:24.989 --> 55:28.784
And then, if you learn anything,
use it to save Yoichi!

55:28.909 --> 55:30.411
Stop it, I said!

55:32.580 --> 55:34.915
The girl with Tomoko lost her mind.

55:35.875 --> 55:38.210
Who knows what'll happen to me?

55:38.294 --> 55:40.463
You'll be fine!

55:44.342 --> 55:46.344
Because I'm not "normal".

55:49.764 --> 55:52.641
Maybe all three of us should just die!

55:52.767 --> 55:57.104
Good idea. We shouldn't have
had a kid in the first place.

55:57.229 --> 55:58.606
Stop it!

56:05.988 --> 56:07.990
There are still two days left.

56:09.700 --> 56:12.745
- Excuse me.
- Come in.

56:15.664 --> 56:19.210
You were asking before about Shizuko...

56:23.214 --> 56:24.840
This is all that's left.

56:30.554 --> 56:32.181
Is this Dr Ikuma?

56:32.306 --> 56:36.143
Yes. It was before I came here.

56:37.061 --> 56:39.188
- Anyway...
- Thank you.

56:45.403 --> 56:49.448
Frolic in brine

56:50.616 --> 56:54.787
Goblins be thine

57:04.880 --> 57:09.510
SUNDAY, SEPTEMBER 19TH

57:27.778 --> 57:32.783
You'd best head home early.
There's a storm on its way tonight.

57:35.661 --> 57:37.872
What was Shizuko like?

57:39.915 --> 57:41.709
She was a strange one.

57:42.793 --> 57:45.838
She'd sit out here the whole day long.

57:46.839 --> 57:51.802
Day in, day out,
just staring at the sea.

57:53.846 --> 57:56.640
The fishermen all hated her.

57:58.434 --> 58:02.771
For us, the sea is unlucky.

58:02.855 --> 58:06.650
Every year, it swallows some of us.

58:09.445 --> 58:12.239
And she'd just stare out at it...

58:12.364 --> 58:14.700
"Frolic in brine, goblins be thine."

58:17.786 --> 58:21.123
If you play in the sea,
the goblins will come for you.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.586
Shizuko could read minds.

58:27.379 --> 58:30.466
She would know things about people
that they didn't want known.

58:31.759 --> 58:33.677
That could be painful.

58:33.761 --> 58:34.845
Go home!

58:36.555 --> 58:39.475
I have some similar abilities myself.

58:41.894 --> 58:44.939
You're the one who told people
about Shizuko, aren't you?

58:45.856 --> 58:48.734
- It was you who called Dr Ikuma.
- I did what?

58:48.817 --> 58:52.613
You thought you could
make money off Shizuko.

58:53.405 --> 58:55.741
You took money
from the newspapers, too.

58:56.617 --> 58:58.661
Shut up!

59:01.872 --> 59:04.708
Tell me about her daughter!
What happened to her?

59:04.792 --> 59:07.711
- I don't know!
- She should've been with Shizuko!

59:11.840 --> 59:13.592
You were there...

59:17.596 --> 59:20.683
...when Shizuko gave her demonstration.

59:55.843 --> 59:57.469
Correct.

01:00:04.226 --> 01:00:05.436
Correct.

01:00:07.271 --> 01:00:08.856
Correct.

01:00:10.649 --> 01:00:12.109
Correct.

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:14.653
Correct.

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:18.782
This is a fraud!

01:00:18.907 --> 01:00:23.829
It's nothing but a vulgar magic show!
You don't fool me!

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:26.874
Dr Ikuma's deceiving you!

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.752
He's making a fool of you!

01:00:33.339 --> 01:00:34.715
Show us the...

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.308
What's wrong?

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:49.271
He's dead.

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.608
She's a monster!

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:00.741
Sadako! You did that?

01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:03.243
Sadako?

01:01:04.745 --> 01:01:07.206
SADA

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.125
Sadako killed him?

01:01:11.377 --> 01:01:13.629
She could simply will someone to die?

01:01:13.712 --> 01:01:16.965
She was a monster.

01:01:19.677 --> 01:01:20.844
Sadako!

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:37.611
Hey!

01:02:06.557 --> 01:02:12.479
Yes. When Shizuko killed herself,
Dr Ikuma took Sadako away with him.

01:02:12.604 --> 01:02:15.941
But no one knows where they went.

01:02:16.024 --> 01:02:18.444
Anyway, you have to find them.

01:02:19.278 --> 01:02:23.157
Dr Ikuma may be dead,
but Sadako would be in her 40s.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.325
I'll explain later. Hurry!

01:02:29.872 --> 01:02:31.874
I doubt Sadako is alive, either.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:37.796
She killed a man
just by willing him dead.

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:42.468
That's power of a different order
from her mother.

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.513
So that video...

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.017
It's not of this world.

01:02:53.771 --> 01:02:56.940
It's Sadako's rage.

01:03:01.195 --> 01:03:03.405
She's put a curse on us.

01:03:12.706 --> 01:03:16.668
It's no good, the typhoon's too close.
All the ferries have been cancelled.

01:03:16.752 --> 01:03:18.837
Try a fishing boat. We'll pay.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:20.464
A fishing boat?

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:24.802
The typhoon might change course.
Your best bet is to wait.

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.637
Then I'll find one!

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.014
Mr Takayama!

01:03:53.872 --> 01:03:56.208
- Hello?
- Ms Asakawa?

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:59.670
I'm sorry, but there's no trace
of either of them.

01:04:01.505 --> 01:04:02.840
Hello?

01:04:02.965 --> 01:04:04.466
Thank you.

01:04:15.394 --> 01:04:16.728
Yoichi!

01:04:34.621 --> 01:04:36.039
Izu...

01:04:46.550 --> 01:04:48.051
Ryuji!

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:57.728
Ryuji...

01:04:59.438 --> 01:05:01.815
The phone didn't ring at my house.

01:05:01.940 --> 01:05:04.651
The only place it rang
was at that cabin!

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:06.904
So the doctor must've...

01:05:07.905 --> 01:05:09.656
But we're stuck here.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:13.577
You can't take a boat out
on a night like this!

01:05:18.290 --> 01:05:20.292
I'll take you.

01:05:30.802 --> 01:05:33.513
Sadako's calling you, isn't she?

01:05:35.015 --> 01:05:40.270
Maybe she wants me to drown.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.241
Take us.

01:06:11.176 --> 01:06:12.594
Strange, isn't it?

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.639
I'm not afraid at all.

01:06:19.977 --> 01:06:24.606
Sadako probably died there,
before that cabin was built.

01:06:25.816 --> 01:06:29.069
Was Sadako Dr Ikuma's daughter?

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.698
He was married with kids.

01:06:32.781 --> 01:06:35.075
His relationship with Shizuko
caused a scandal.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.285
That all contributed to him being fired.

01:06:39.955 --> 01:06:41.999
We have to find Sadako's body.

01:06:42.958 --> 01:06:46.336
Will that lift the curse?
Will that save Yoichi?

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.506
It's all we can do.

01:06:54.594 --> 01:06:56.513
Just one day left.

01:07:23.665 --> 01:07:26.376
I guess Sadako doesn't hate you.

01:07:31.757 --> 01:07:34.718
Shizuko used to talk to the sea.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:39.389
She'd just sit there and mumble to it.

01:07:41.600 --> 01:07:44.686
Once, I listened to her secretly.

01:07:47.773 --> 01:07:50.817
But it wasn't human language.

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:04.831
MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 20TH

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:14.674
Hello?

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.384
Yoichi?

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:20.471
I'll check back tomorrow.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:24.475
I'm bored here.
I want to get back to school!

01:08:26.394 --> 01:08:29.856
Don't say that,
you'll hurt Grandpa's feelings.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:32.818
Grandpa's laughing.
Want to talk to him?

01:08:39.908 --> 01:08:41.243
I'm sorry.

01:08:43.286 --> 01:08:45.037
I'll hurry home.

01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:49.417
What's wrong?

01:08:51.877 --> 01:08:55.215
Mummy has something she needs to do.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:09:00.970
Say hello to Grandpa for me,
won't you?

01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:22.742
What time did you watch the video?

01:09:22.826 --> 01:09:26.872
Seven or eight minutes past seven.

01:09:26.997 --> 01:09:29.332
If the story's true, that's your deadline.

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.374
Here it is.

01:11:31.413 --> 01:11:33.331
A well? I knew it.

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:34.708
A well?

01:12:22.422 --> 01:12:23.965
Her father?

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:31.598
Dr Ikuma put this lid on.
Sadako's under here.

01:13:19.396 --> 01:13:20.897
I'll go down.

01:14:02.355 --> 01:14:04.357
Sadako was still alive!

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:07.777
She tried to climb out.

01:14:31.718 --> 01:14:33.386
Lower the buckets!

01:14:54.866 --> 01:14:56.409
Take it up!

01:15:27.524 --> 01:15:28.775
Take it up!

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:53.258
Take it up!

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.467
It's six o'clock!

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:40.513
I know! Hurry and take it up!

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:06.164
Take it up!

01:17:09.917 --> 01:17:11.336
Asakawa?

01:17:39.238 --> 01:17:41.908
Damn it! Are you trying to kill me?

01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:44.911
Hey!

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:57.632
Asakawa?

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.231
Trade places.

01:18:14.607 --> 01:18:16.776
You can't lift anymore.

01:18:18.569 --> 01:18:19.904
No!

01:18:21.447 --> 01:18:23.950
Then who's going to pull the buckets up?

01:18:24.075 --> 01:18:26.703
Is this really going to do any good?

01:18:28.538 --> 01:18:30.373
And what about Yoichi?

01:18:31.249 --> 01:18:33.209
She'll go for him, too!

01:18:53.521 --> 01:18:55.440
Don't look down!

01:19:17.462 --> 01:19:19.505
Where are you?

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:20.965
Come out!

01:19:52.079 --> 01:19:55.625
Please! Where are you?

01:20:51.973 --> 01:20:53.599
It's you.

01:21:23.087 --> 01:21:25.506
Hey, Asakawa!

01:21:25.631 --> 01:21:28.551
It's past seven! It's 7:10!

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.512
We're saved!

01:21:50.823 --> 01:21:53.492
Why did the doctor kill Sadako?

01:21:54.911 --> 01:21:57.079
His own daughter?

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:00.917
Maybe she wasn't his daughter.

01:22:02.418 --> 01:22:03.628
Huh?

01:22:04.837 --> 01:22:09.634
Maybe her father... wasn't human.

01:22:16.974 --> 01:22:18.809
The marks are gone.

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:22.271
It's over.

01:22:24.398 --> 01:22:26.400
I'll take you home.

01:23:17.201 --> 01:23:19.537
Get some rest.

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.789
I've got a deadline to meet.

01:23:26.335 --> 01:23:27.670
Thank you.

01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:32.568
Idiot!

01:25:03.933 --> 01:25:08.479
TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 21ST

01:26:11.250 --> 01:26:12.585
Why?

01:26:24.597 --> 01:26:27.391
That's it... Asakawa!

01:28:11.704 --> 01:28:13.580
Are you a resident?

01:28:13.706 --> 01:28:15.374
I'm Ryuji Takayama's wife.

01:28:15.499 --> 01:28:18.419
The body's already been removed,
ma'am.

01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:29.054
What happened?

01:28:31.098 --> 01:28:34.310
When I got here,
he was lying on the floor.

01:28:34.393 --> 01:28:37.938
Did he say anything to you?
About a video?

01:28:42.609 --> 01:28:44.194
His face...

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:00.336
Why Ryuji?

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.339
Will Yoichi die, too?

01:29:04.173 --> 01:29:06.383
Didn't we lift the curse?

01:29:07.468 --> 01:29:09.720
Why was I the only one saved?

01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:12.741
Sadako's curse was only lifted from me.

01:30:13.826 --> 01:30:16.203
Why not you, Ryuji?

01:30:18.497 --> 01:30:20.916
What did I do that you didn't?

01:30:22.793 --> 01:30:25.546
What did I do that you didn't?

01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:44.148
Ryuji?

01:31:04.710 --> 01:31:09.965
Something I did that you didn't
to lift the curse...

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:20.726
I copied it!

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:23.395
I showed it to you.

01:31:42.915 --> 01:31:46.627
Dad? Yeah, I'm on my way.

01:31:48.337 --> 01:31:49.838
I need a favour.

01:31:51.173 --> 01:31:52.841
It's for Yoichi.

01:31:56.470 --> 01:32:00.474
They say there's one way
you can see it and not die.

01:32:00.557 --> 01:32:04.144
You have to copy it and show it
to someone else within one week.

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:09.191
- And what happens to them?
- They have to do the same thing.

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:13.028
- So it never ends?
- That's right. It goes on and on.

01:32:13.111 --> 01:32:17.324
But if you don't want to die...
you'll do it, won't you?

01:32:30.420 --> 01:32:37.469
WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 22ND
