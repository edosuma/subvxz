01:15.901 --> 01:17.467
Oh, come on.

01:17.467 --> 01:19.834
I really don't
spend that much.

01:19.834 --> 01:23.167
Can't I keep just one
of my credit cards?

01:23.167 --> 01:25.501
I'll make you
a sandwich.

01:29.267 --> 01:31.133
No, thank you,
ma'am.

01:31.133 --> 01:32.901
I had a couple of
doughnuts this morning,

01:32.901 --> 01:34.901
waiting for a jumper
to make up his mind.

01:37.534 --> 01:38.667
The cards,
please.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.267
Okay, fine.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.200
But you ought
to be ashamed.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.234
You really don't have
anything better to do

01:45.234 --> 01:46.267
than harass me

01:46.267 --> 01:48.734
when there are real
criminals out there?

01:48.734 --> 01:51.300
I mean,
my husband alone

01:51.300 --> 01:54.934
has over 100 unpaid
parking tickets.

01:59.901 --> 02:02.834
That's AlBundy,
right?

02:02.834 --> 02:04.100
Uh-huh.

02:05.033 --> 02:08.868
Don't tell him
that I told you.

02:08.868 --> 02:12.200
Uh, is there any reward
for turning him in?

02:19.000 --> 02:20.834
Hey, don't forget,

02:20.834 --> 02:24.701
if we paid taxes,
we'd be paying your salary.

02:29.801 --> 02:33.067
Well, kids, we have
no more credit cards.

02:33.067 --> 02:34.567
Let this be
a lesson to you.

02:34.567 --> 02:36.567
Marry someone
who can afford you.

02:38.901 --> 02:41.000
Mom, was there
ever a time

02:41.000 --> 02:43.367
when Dad could have
made something of his life?

02:44.501 --> 02:49.100
Yes, actually,
back before you were born,

02:49.100 --> 02:51.334
I remember we were
watching TV,

02:51.334 --> 02:53.567
and he said,
"I wish there was some way

02:53.567 --> 02:55.767
to change the channel
from my seat."

02:56.767 --> 02:58.934
That was as close
as he ever came.

02:59.968 --> 03:03.000
Still not
a bad idea.

03:07.901 --> 03:10.567
Hi, honey.
How was your day?

03:10.567 --> 03:11.968
Hey, I came home.

03:11.968 --> 03:14.400
How good could it
have been?

03:21.701 --> 03:24.667
But at least I got to cheer
the guys up at the gas station.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.868
See, after I filled up
the old war-wagon,

03:26.868 --> 03:28.868
I pulled out
the credit card.

03:28.868 --> 03:31.667
They pulled out the switchblade,
cut it up.

03:32.501 --> 03:34.300
Then we all laughed.

03:35.701 --> 03:37.467
Then they
gave me a hose,

03:37.467 --> 03:40.367
made me suck all the gas
back out of the car.

03:41.334 --> 03:43.167
But I got the last laugh,
though.

03:43.167 --> 03:46.000
I swallowed about
50 cents worth.

03:48.133 --> 03:50.100
Well, let's take
your mind off it.

03:50.100 --> 03:51.567
Here are the bills.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.534
Feel better,
honey?

03:58.701 --> 04:02.334
Ed McMahon says I may
owe him $10 million?

04:07.167 --> 04:10.367
Oh, what are the chances
of it really being you?

04:13.801 --> 04:15.601
Ah, the phone bill.

04:17.701 --> 04:20.801
Hey, we qualify
for the gold bill.

04:20.801 --> 04:23.367
That's great!
I knew we
could do it!

04:23.367 --> 04:26.334
Peg, Peg, could you
cut out the festivities

04:26.334 --> 04:27.601
till after I'm done?

04:28.834 --> 04:30.834
Milwaukee, Milwaukee,
Milwaukee,

04:30.834 --> 04:32.167
that's the town
they built

04:32.167 --> 04:34.801
around your mother,
isn't it, Peg?

04:37.067 --> 04:38.834
Look at all
these toll calls!

04:38.834 --> 04:41.534
Who called
the lust line?

04:43.767 --> 04:45.300
Well, it's not
what you think, Dad.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.834
It's just
naked girls

04:46.834 --> 04:49.367
talking dirty to me
on the phone.

04:49.367 --> 04:52.334
Well, that's okay,
then.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.501
What about these three pages
of toll calls

04:56.501 --> 04:59.100
to the heavy metal
hotline?

05:01.667 --> 05:03.467
Oh, then, that must
have been me, Dad.

05:03.467 --> 05:04.968
But I was saving
you money.

05:04.968 --> 05:06.968
How did you
do that, pumpkin?

05:06.968 --> 05:10.367
Well, because they said
that it's $3.00

05:10.367 --> 05:11.534
for the first minute

05:11.534 --> 05:13.300
and 50 cents for each
additional minute.

05:13.300 --> 05:15.567
So, rather than
get charged extra,

05:15.567 --> 05:19.334
I'd hang up after a minute,
and then call back.

05:28.067 --> 05:30.968
Well, at least
she's trying, Al.

05:32.200 --> 05:33.868
Oh, God!

05:38.434 --> 05:41.100
See, honey, we're sorry
you had a bad day.

05:41.100 --> 05:43.701
Would you like
some dinner?

05:46.367 --> 05:48.234
Yeah.

05:48.234 --> 05:51.767
Gee, I was hoping
you'd say no.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.534
Oh, hey, Dad,
Mrs. Donnelly called,

05:55.534 --> 05:57.901
and she said her slipper
won't fit over her bunion,

05:57.901 --> 05:59.801
and she wants to know
what she should do.

05:59.801 --> 06:01.334
Start walking
on all fours

06:01.334 --> 06:03.200
the way God
intended her to.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.300
What's wrong
with these people?

06:05.300 --> 06:07.701
If I had a dime
for every time

06:07.701 --> 06:09.968
they called me
and asked for shoe advice, I--

06:12.400 --> 06:15.234
Wait a second.
I just had a vision.

06:15.234 --> 06:17.567
Peg, I think I know a way
that we can make a fortune.

06:17.567 --> 06:18.834
You want to hear
about it?

06:18.834 --> 06:20.100
No.
Not really.

06:20.100 --> 06:22.267
I don't think so.

06:22.267 --> 06:24.367
I'll give you a hint.

06:24.367 --> 06:28.033
What can I do better
than anyone else?

06:28.033 --> 06:31.534
Stink up a shoe?

06:32.434 --> 06:34.701
Sweat through the couch?

06:36.367 --> 06:38.200
Miss the toilet
in the dark?

06:42.634 --> 06:45.133
Hey, Marcie.
Guess what.

06:45.133 --> 06:47.400
I'm closing another loan,

06:47.400 --> 06:48.934
and that puts me
in the lead

06:48.934 --> 06:52.300
for that free trip
to Hawaii.

06:52.300 --> 06:56.834
Yeah, the hick's signing
the papers right now.

06:59.901 --> 07:01.000
Oh, not you.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.601
I was talking
about some other hick.

07:04.601 --> 07:08.200
Uh, listen, Marce,
the hick is staring at me.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.634
I gotta go.

07:09.634 --> 07:12.834
Keep the poi
warm for Daddy.

Thank you,

we only care about you.

07:18.667 --> 07:21.968

to come for supper one night.

I caught you.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.167
I need a loan.

07:38.167 --> 07:40.267
See, I'm gonna buy
my own toll line.

07:40.267 --> 07:41.267
Yeah,
it'll be great.

2 bucks a pop

07:45.534 --> 07:47.634
it's just another

Well, actually,
I only need 18.

What did you want
to see me about, sir?

Rhoades, do you know
how many loans

09:07.234 --> 09:10.100
you've written this year
that have gone bad?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.634
One or two.

09:11.634 --> 09:12.701
Forty.

09:12.701 --> 09:15.000
[MOUTHING]

09:15.000 --> 09:17.834
Well, I guess that gives me
something to think about

09:17.834 --> 09:20.300
while I'm on
that beach in Hawaii.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.067
Well, I hope your zeal
to win this trip

09:22.067 --> 09:23.467
hasn't affected
your judgment.

09:23.467 --> 09:24.834

let's talk about

09:24.834 --> 09:26.334

Yes, sir.

in the loan?

and soul, sir.

on the line for it?

09:34.868 --> 09:36.167
No, sir.

I'm going to a party
in five minutes,

10:45.133 --> 10:48.133

for both of my feet.

Not that I'm being
negative, mind you.

12:08.767 --> 12:11.467

has called today,

for a million years.

13:02.467 --> 13:05.400
Steve, you haven't
given up on me, have you?

13:08.000 --> 13:09.801
[DOORBELL RINGS]

13:09.801 --> 13:11.033
Dr. Shoe!

13:11.033 --> 13:13.734
It's the
doorbell, Al.

13:13.734 --> 13:15.234
Well, get it, Peg.
I'm on the phone.

13:15.234 --> 13:16.467
Dr. Shoe.

13:19.133 --> 13:21.434
The government
should be paying us.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.734
I mean, if he's
not disabled, who is?

13:27.567 --> 13:30.601
Well, Steve, you told me
not to yell at you

13:30.601 --> 13:32.267
about the loan
until midnight.

13:32.267 --> 13:34.467
Then I'd see.

13:34.467 --> 13:36.534
What am
I seeing?

13:36.534 --> 13:38.100
Hello?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.067
Hello?

13:40.067 --> 13:41.133
Hello?

13:41.133 --> 13:42.334
Hello?

13:42.334 --> 13:44.400
Well, Steve?

13:48.901 --> 13:51.868
He hasn't spoken
for hours, Marcie.

13:53.367 --> 13:57.734
Don't you pull that
coma stuff with me, Steven!

14:01.267 --> 14:05.067
You loaned
this man $50,000?

14:05.067 --> 14:08.000
That's $1,000
an IQ point.

14:09.934 --> 14:11.434
And I can't
blame Al.

14:11.434 --> 14:12.601
A man gives
a gun to a chimp,

14:12.601 --> 14:14.200
and the chimp
shoots someone,

14:14.200 --> 14:16.501
you don't
blame the chimp.

14:23.801 --> 14:28.033
Hey! That was a hidden
dig at me, wasn't it?

14:30.701 --> 14:32.100
Well, let me tell
you something.

14:32.100 --> 14:33.267
The opera ain't over

14:33.267 --> 14:35.767
till the last heterosexual
falls asleep.

14:37.701 --> 14:39.801
This idea
will work.

14:39.801 --> 14:41.834
How many calls
did you get tonight, Al?

14:41.834 --> 14:43.701
Dr. Shoe's files
are confidential.

14:43.701 --> 14:45.667
None.
You got none!

14:45.667 --> 14:47.367
None today.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.267
Tomorrow,
twice as many!

14:52.400 --> 14:55.133
This is what you
loan money to?

14:56.634 --> 14:58.701
I wanted
to go to Hawaii.

14:58.701 --> 15:00.868
Oh, well, Steve,

15:00.868 --> 15:03.067
I guess much like
our honeymoon,

15:03.067 --> 15:05.234
it's up to me
to finish the job,

15:05.234 --> 15:07.434
and pay the bill.

15:09.601 --> 15:12.367
Al, I'm going to
loan you $50,000.

15:12.367 --> 15:13.767
We're rich!

15:13.767 --> 15:15.133
We're rich,
honey!

15:15.133 --> 15:16.467
I told you
I could do it, Peg!

15:16.467 --> 15:17.801
[LAUGHING]

15:17.801 --> 15:19.601
Oh, shut up.

15:19.601 --> 15:21.601
It's so you can
repay the loan

15:21.601 --> 15:25.300
and the human
dribble-glass here
can keep his job.

15:25.300 --> 15:27.200
I've got a good record
at my bank.

15:27.200 --> 15:28.634
I can bury
one bad loan.

15:28.634 --> 15:31.067
Al, I'll be over
in the morning
with the paperwork.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.167
Let's go, Steve.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.734
Come home
and service me.

15:42.334 --> 15:45.968
And God help you
if you screw that up!

15:51.567 --> 15:55.100
This is your fault.
You should have to go.

15:58.801 --> 15:59.834
Come!

15:59.834 --> 16:01.367
Yes, dear.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.767
Boy, if you had
to service me

16:15.767 --> 16:17.701
every time you did
something stupid,

16:17.701 --> 16:20.033
I'd be as flat
as an all-beef patty.

16:24.334 --> 16:27.133
Well, honey, at least
this stupid idea

16:27.133 --> 16:28.400
didn't cost us
anything.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.934
No, Peg, it didn't cost
Steve anything.

16:30.934 --> 16:32.767
We still
owe $50,000,

16:32.767 --> 16:34.467
it's just
to another bank.

16:34.467 --> 16:36.400
So, I'll be broke
and living in the gutter,

16:36.400 --> 16:38.968
but, Peg, will
I still have you?

16:38.968 --> 16:42.634
Aw, Al, you know
I'd never leave you.
Yeah.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.968
Then I truly
have nothing.

16:47.901 --> 16:49.467
But I'm not going

16:49.467 --> 16:50.868
to roll over
and play dead.

16:50.868 --> 16:54.234
Oh, yes, save something
for when we go to bed.

16:57.334 --> 17:01.033
No, my little
thumbscrew.

17:01.033 --> 17:02.767
I'm getting an idea.

17:02.767 --> 17:06.200
I'm not going
to pay Steve back.

17:06.200 --> 17:09.767
I'm going to reinvest
in my shoe line.

17:09.767 --> 17:12.701
Al Bundy is not going into
the gutter owing $50,000.

17:12.701 --> 17:16.099
I'm going into the gutter
owing $100,000.

17:18.267 --> 17:21.067
<i>Hi, I'm Dr. Shoe.</i>

17:21.067 --> 17:23.934
Awhile back,
I advertised my shoe line,

17:23.934 --> 17:26.534
but apparently,
you weren't watching.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.934
So I'm back.

17:29.934 --> 17:32.701
Now, you can't tell me you
haven't bought defective shoes,

17:32.701 --> 17:33.701
'cause I know.

17:33.701 --> 17:35.067
I sell 'em.

17:36.367 --> 17:39.701
So call 555-SHOE.

17:39.701 --> 17:41.567
Even if you don't
have a problem,

17:41.567 --> 17:43.267
and you just want
to talk about feet.

17:43.267 --> 17:44.734
Call.
I'm serious.

17:44.734 --> 17:46.367
This is not
a recorded message.

17:46.367 --> 17:48.334
I am a human being,
damn it!

17:50.033 --> 17:51.334
That number is

17:51.334 --> 17:54.200
555-SHOE.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.267
Let's go!

18:04.767 --> 18:07.467
<i>Hi, Dr. Shoe again.</i>

18:07.467 --> 18:10.000
I've been telling you
about my shoe line.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.434
Nobody cares.

18:11.434 --> 18:15.267
So let me mention
something else here.

18:15.267 --> 18:19.367
555-SHOE also spells

18:19.367 --> 18:22.234
555-RIND,

18:22.234 --> 18:24.534
555-PINF,

18:24.534 --> 18:28.033
and 555-RGNE.

18:28.033 --> 18:31.367
Remember, nobody knows
as much about "rgne"

18:31.367 --> 18:33.067
as Dr. Rgne.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.934
<i>Hello,
It's Dr. Shoe again.</i>

18:40.934 --> 18:42.834
I've made several pleas
and nobody cares,

18:42.834 --> 18:46.467
so let's cut the crap,
and get to it.

18:46.467 --> 18:49.567
I want to introduce
you to some people.

18:49.567 --> 18:51.300
This is Mrs. Shoe.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.334
My daughter,
Kelly Shoe.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.634
My son,
Bud Shoe.

19:05.033 --> 19:07.667
And Buck,
the Shoe dog.

19:14.267 --> 19:15.767
We're starving.

19:15.767 --> 19:16.968
Could you
please call?

19:16.968 --> 19:18.234
You don't have
to talk to me.

19:18.234 --> 19:19.234
Just hang up.

19:19.234 --> 19:20.834
It's charity,
for God's sake.

19:20.834 --> 19:25.334
Kids, you don't even need
your parents' permission.

19:32.367 --> 19:36.133
It'll-it'll just be
our little secret.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.734
MAN'S VOICE:
Time's up, Bundy.

19:38.734 --> 19:40.501
Uh, please call,
please call. Let's rap.

19:40.501 --> 19:41.901
Uh, you want
somebody dead?

19:41.901 --> 19:42.968
I'll kill them.

19:42.968 --> 19:44.200
Please call.

19:44.200 --> 19:45.300
That number
again is--

19:45.300 --> 19:47.501
This is what you did
with my $50,000?

19:47.501 --> 19:49.968
Another satisfied customer.
You can be too.

19:49.968 --> 19:51.234
Aah! Please call me.

19:58.067 --> 19:59.334
Hey, Peg,

19:59.334 --> 20:02.234
I thought you
were going to meet us

20:02.234 --> 20:03.701
down at the courthouse.

20:03.701 --> 20:05.033
Oh,

20:05.033 --> 20:07.367
Was that today?

20:07.367 --> 20:08.367
Uh...

20:08.367 --> 20:11.434
Oh, there it is.

20:11.434 --> 20:12.934
Right there
in black and white:

20:12.934 --> 20:15.033
"Al's sentencing."

20:17.100 --> 20:20.434
Well, I'll just have
to make the next one.

20:20.434 --> 20:21.934
So, how was it?

20:21.934 --> 20:23.834
Oh,
it was so cool.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.567
The judge
laughed at Daddy,

20:25.567 --> 20:27.601
and then he got serious,
so he yelled at him,

20:27.601 --> 20:29.234
and then he laughed
at him again,

20:29.234 --> 20:31.334
and then everybody
started laughing at Daddy.

20:31.334 --> 20:32.334
It was so funny.

20:32.334 --> 20:34.601
I can't believe
I missed it.

20:34.601 --> 20:36.267
Oh, it was great.

20:36.267 --> 20:37.834
The trial had
everything.

20:37.834 --> 20:39.367
Crying--that
was Mr. Rhoades.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.200
He lost his job,
you know.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.667
And then,

20:43.667 --> 20:45.467
there was an honest
to goodness fit.

20:45.467 --> 20:46.868
That was
Mrs. Rhoades.

20:46.868 --> 20:50.367
She got demoted
to drive-up window teller.

20:50.367 --> 20:53.734
And then Daddy and the judge
and a whole bunch of lawyers

20:53.734 --> 20:54.834
went into this chamber.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.000
Bring it home,
Daddy.

20:57.000 --> 20:58.868
Well, after the lawyers
got done going,

20:58.868 --> 21:00.567
"Hey, did you check out
the blond bimbo

21:00.567 --> 21:03.100
in the red mini?"

21:03.100 --> 21:05.400
That was me.

21:06.434 --> 21:07.934
Anyhow,

21:07.934 --> 21:09.567
then we finally
got down to business.

21:09.567 --> 21:11.200
I begged
for the death penalty,

21:11.200 --> 21:14.367
but they insisted
that I learn a lesson.

21:14.367 --> 21:16.767
So to pay back
the $100,000 I owe,

21:16.767 --> 21:18.434
the banks agreed
to extend my mortgage

21:18.434 --> 21:19.968
for a couple
of years.

21:19.968 --> 21:21.000
How many?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.567
Oh, a hundred.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.334
So by the year
2157,

21:26.334 --> 21:27.968
we'll have
the second one paid-off.

21:27.968 --> 21:30.434
Then I can retire.

21:32.367 --> 21:33.801
No, no, no,
Dad.

21:33.801 --> 21:36.234
Then you start paying off
your parking tickets.

21:36.234 --> 21:40.400
Hey, how the hell did they
find out about that anyway?

21:40.400 --> 21:43.901
Gee, it must have
been that darn Steve.

21:43.901 --> 21:47.000
Aw, but come on.
Buck up, honey.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.601
Don't worry.

21:48.601 --> 21:51.067
I'll always be
your Mrs. Shoe.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.701
And we'll always be
your little Shoes.

21:53.701 --> 21:55.634
Shoe betcha!

21:57.000 --> 22:00.601
So you haven't lost
any more respect for me?

22:00.601 --> 22:02.701
Oh, now, that
would be impossible,

22:02.701 --> 22:03.767
wouldn't it, kids?

22:03.767 --> 22:06.901
I mean, honey,
you lost $100,000.

22:06.901 --> 22:09.868
How many men who earn
less than a fry cook

22:09.868 --> 22:13.734
can say they lost
$100,000?

22:14.367 --> 22:16.234
Fry cook?

22:16.234 --> 22:19.467
Dad makes less than
the newspaper boy.

22:19.467 --> 22:22.167
A street mime.

22:22.167 --> 22:24.901
The guy who scrapes
dead animals off the highway.

22:26.534 --> 22:28.634
A lab
animal.

22:28.634 --> 22:30.467
A circus geek.

22:30.467 --> 22:33.968
A barnacle
scraper.

22:33.968 --> 22:35.667
A professional
miniature golfer.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.534
A qualified
teacher.
