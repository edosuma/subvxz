<i>I'm going to tell</i>
<i>you a story now.</i>

00:38.173 --> 00:40.564
<i>But as any good storyteller knows,</i>

00:40.642 --> 00:44.237
<i>one must first be sure</i>
<i>the audience is prepared.</i>

00:44.312 --> 00:46.712
<i>Is everybody comfortably seated?</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:49.045
<i>Does anyone need to use the bathroom?</i>

00:49.117 --> 00:52.211
<i>Oh. You, sir, in the back?</i>

00:52.287 --> 00:54.187
<i>Well, hold it in.</i>

00:56.524 --> 00:59.152
<i>You ready? Here we go.</i>

01:02.130 --> 01:04.997
<i>My name is Marty Bronson.</i>

01:05.066 --> 01:09.059
<i>I owned and operated</i>
<i>the Sunny Vista Motel,</i>

01:09.137 --> 01:12.766
<i>which I established on the corner</i>
<i>of Sunset and La Cienega Boulevards</i>

01:12.841 --> 01:17.904
<i>in Los Angeles, California,</i>
<i>in the year 1974.</i>

01:17.979 --> 01:21.506
<i>The motel was my labor of love,</i>

01:21.583 --> 01:24.416
<i>and I ran it with the help</i>
<i>of my children: Wendy...</i>

01:24.486 --> 01:28.684
Wendy, the key, please,
for Mr. and Mrs. Dixon.

01:30.025 --> 01:31.014
Thank you.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.218
<i>And Skeeter.</i>

01:35.196 --> 01:37.790
May I help you with your bags,
Mr. and Mrs. Dixon?

01:37.866 --> 01:40.334
- Yes, please.
- Why, thank you, young man.

01:44.706 --> 01:46.230
You, uh, need a hand?

01:46.308 --> 01:48.071
No, no. I got it.

01:49.210 --> 01:50.472
OK.

01:52.213 --> 01:56.047
<i>To my boy Skeeter,</i>
<i>the motel was a wonderland.</i>

01:56.117 --> 01:57.778
Way too hyper.

01:57.852 --> 02:00.412
The galaxy's not big enough
for the both of us.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.978
<i>A magical place.</i>

02:05.093 --> 02:08.529
<i>Full of new adventures</i>
<i>for a six-year-old boy.</i>

02:10.065 --> 02:13.193
Oh, Skeeter. Come here.

02:15.870 --> 02:19.601
<i>Skeeter loved the old place</i>
<i>as much as I did.</i>

02:19.674 --> 02:23.110
<i>And he always tried to come up</i>
<i>with ways to make it even better.</i>

02:23.178 --> 02:26.477
I've got a lot of ideas how
to improve things around here.

02:26.548 --> 02:30.382
I was thinking we could put
an extra pair of socks in each room

02:30.452 --> 02:34.183
because people always forget to pack
enough socks when they go on a trip.

02:35.190 --> 02:36.680
That's a good idea.

02:36.758 --> 02:39.158
Time for bed,
I'm meeting with Mr. Nottingham.

02:39.227 --> 02:41.821
Wait, Dad. I'm not even tired.

02:41.896 --> 02:45.297
Well, how about a bedtime story?

02:45.367 --> 02:46.698
Yay!

02:49.104 --> 02:54.371
Now, once upon a time,
there was a little boy,

02:54.442 --> 02:57.070
and that little boy's name
was Skeeter.

02:57.145 --> 03:01.878
<i>Well, I could tell a pretty fair tale</i>
<i>when the muse was with me.</i>

03:01.950 --> 03:04.248
<i>And making my little boy smile,</i>

03:04.319 --> 03:06.753
<i>now, that was truly magical.</i>

03:06.821 --> 03:11.758
<i>Yeah, I was a pretty good dad</i>
<i>and a pretty good host.</i>

03:11.826 --> 03:16.195
<i>But unfortunately,</i>
<i>a pretty bad businessman.</i>

03:16.264 --> 03:19.165
Can't you read the writing
on the wall, Bronson?

03:19.234 --> 03:21.702
This motel is sinking in red ink...

03:21.770 --> 03:24.068
and I'm offering you the last lifeboat.

03:26.141 --> 03:27.631
I don't know.

03:27.709 --> 03:29.870
I've seen the books, Martin.

03:29.944 --> 03:33.107
If you don't sell to me,
you're going to go bankrupt.

03:33.181 --> 03:34.978
Yes, well, I...

03:35.049 --> 03:38.246
I'd always hoped this place
would be a home for my children.

03:38.319 --> 03:39.980
How about this?

03:40.054 --> 03:43.353
If your boy works hard and shows
some smarts when he grows up,

03:43.425 --> 03:45.416
I'll let him run this place.

03:46.294 --> 03:48.125
You promise?

03:48.196 --> 03:51.461
Yes. Now sign the bloody papers.

03:58.139 --> 04:00.107
That's my boy, Bronson.

04:00.175 --> 04:04.839
Trust me, I'm going to turn this place
into the finest hotel in Los Angeles.

04:04.913 --> 04:08.849
It's going to be uptight
and out of sight.

04:08.917 --> 04:13.718
<i> And just like that,</i>
<i>our modest little Sunny Vista Motel...</i>

04:13.788 --> 04:18.555
<i>... metamorphosized into the</i>
<i>mighty Sunny Vista Nottingham.</i>

04:18.625 --> 04:21.060
<i>And for the past 25 years,</i>

04:21.129 --> 04:24.530
<i>it has been lovingly maintained</i>
<i>by my now grown-up son,</i>

04:24.599 --> 04:27.432
<i>Skeeter Bronson, the handyman.</i>

04:27.502 --> 04:30.801
<i>Yes, though Mr. Nottingham's promise</i>
<i>for Skeeter to run the place</i>

04:30.872 --> 04:33.397
- <i>seems to have been forgotten...</i>
- Hiya, Pop.

04:33.475 --> 04:37.070
<i>... my boy always works diligently</i>
<i>with a hopeful heart,</i>

04:37.145 --> 04:39.010
<i>still waiting for his shot.</i>

04:39.080 --> 04:41.947
Mrs. Dixon?
Is there a problem with her room?

04:42.016 --> 04:44.712
Nothing you should bother
your tiny mind about.

04:44.786 --> 04:48.381
Mrs. Dixon has been taking the nip
bottles of liquor out of her mini-bar,

04:48.456 --> 04:49.787
and doesn't want to pay for it.

04:49.858 --> 04:52.850
I never even touched
that evil little refrigerator.

04:52.927 --> 04:54.827
I don't drink alcohol.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.830
Of course.
There's probably a mix-up.

04:56.898 --> 04:59.264
- I saw who took it.
- OK.

04:59.334 --> 05:01.461
He had red hair and a beard.

05:01.536 --> 05:04.027
He was wearing a green suit
with brass buttons.

05:04.105 --> 05:06.539
And he stands about ten inches tall.

05:06.608 --> 05:09.202
So we're talking about a leprechaun?

05:09.277 --> 05:10.301
There you go.

05:10.378 --> 05:12.846
Oh, I didn't know your brother
was in town.

05:12.914 --> 05:15.144
So, um, here's what
I think we should do.

05:15.216 --> 05:18.652
Put all the missing bottles
on my tab.

05:18.720 --> 05:21.450
Next time you see any leprechauns,
we'll tell Aspen.

05:21.523 --> 05:22.581
She's half-troll.

05:22.657 --> 05:25.125
I think, trolls eat
leprechauns, am I right?

05:26.928 --> 05:28.190
She would.

05:29.898 --> 05:33.334
<i> Today magic is</i>
<i>in the air at the grand hotel,</i>

05:33.401 --> 05:35.926
<i>and the winds of change</i>
<i>are about to blow our story</i>

05:36.004 --> 05:38.302
<i>in a strange new direction.</i>

05:38.373 --> 05:40.307
<i>But what would you expect in a hotel</i>

05:40.375 --> 05:43.344
<i>founded by someone who loved</i>
<i>a good story as much as I?</i>

05:43.411 --> 05:45.709
Time is of the essence here, Skeeter.

05:45.780 --> 05:49.511
Oh, yeah, I know. I just don't want
the big boss man to get electrocuted.

05:49.584 --> 05:50.915
Of course.

05:50.985 --> 05:53.977
- You fixed it?
- Let me see here.

05:54.055 --> 05:56.353
Yo, yo. Yo, yo.

05:56.424 --> 05:59.416
Check, check. One, two. Come on.
Yeah, yeah. Hear me in the back?

05:59.494 --> 06:01.086
- Whoa, whoa.
- Skeeter.

06:01.162 --> 06:03.221
I say "Barry,"
you say "Nottingham."

06:03.298 --> 06:05.027
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

06:05.099 --> 06:06.657
- Barry.
- Nottingham.

06:06.734 --> 06:08.861
<i># Barry had a Nottingham</i>

06:08.937 --> 06:11.201
<i># Nottingham, Nottingham</i>

06:11.272 --> 06:13.001
<i># Barry had a Nottingham</i>

06:13.074 --> 06:15.736
<i># Whose beard was</i>
<i>white as snow #</i>

06:15.810 --> 06:18.677
Come on,
give it up for the big man.

06:20.148 --> 06:21.672
Got them warmed up for you, sir.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.115
- It's good to see you again.
- Germs.

06:24.185 --> 06:25.209
- Germs?
- Uh, Skeeter,

06:25.286 --> 06:27.413
Mr. Nottingham has
developed a fear, uh...

06:27.488 --> 06:28.853
Not a fear, an awareness...

06:28.923 --> 06:31.517
...of germs and
how dangerous they can be

06:31.593 --> 06:34.926
when not properly... feared, so...

06:34.996 --> 06:37.396
You're doing the right thing.
I didn't shower today.

06:37.465 --> 06:39.228
So, yeah, let me get out of here.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.962
Barry Nottingham, everybody.

06:44.205 --> 06:47.572
- He's brilliant, him. I love this guy.
- Welcome.

06:47.642 --> 06:52.602
As you know, I own 23 hotels
from Berlin to Beijing.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.739
But it's no secret that this one,

06:54.816 --> 06:58.013
the Sunny Vista Nottingham,
is my favorite.

07:01.289 --> 07:05.020
However, this is a 20th-century hotel.

07:05.093 --> 07:08.290
We need something for the 21 st century.

07:08.363 --> 07:11.764
And so, we have decided
to close this hotel

07:11.833 --> 07:16.861
and to build a brand-new
Sunny Vista Mega Nottingham.

07:19.641 --> 07:23.008
This will be the largest hotel
on the West Coast.

07:23.077 --> 07:26.672
I simply don't understand what the fuss
is about. It's just a big building.

07:26.748 --> 07:29.512
Oh, no, no. This is like the
future of the hotel business.

07:29.584 --> 07:33.247
...and a top-secret theme
that will blow your mind.

07:35.590 --> 07:36.852
Yes!

07:36.924 --> 07:41.827
So I'm proud to announce
the new hotel's general manager.

07:41.896 --> 07:44.956
He's been waiting on this
for a long time.

07:45.033 --> 07:49.163
We all know how hard he works,
how intelligent he is,

07:49.237 --> 07:51.671
how much this hotel means to him.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.833
Take a bow, Mr. Kendall Duncan!

07:55.743 --> 07:57.176
Take a bow, Kendall.

07:58.279 --> 08:00.474
- God bless.
- Boo!

08:02.050 --> 08:04.712
A beautiful speech, sir.
A beautiful speech.

08:04.786 --> 08:06.777
I'm so glad you could come.

08:06.854 --> 08:08.651
It's great to see you.

08:08.723 --> 08:10.156
Don't touch me.

08:10.224 --> 08:11.555
Well done, Daddy.

08:13.928 --> 08:16.863
Oh, oh, hello there.
Do you know my daughter, Violet?

08:16.931 --> 08:18.865
Only by reputation, sir.

08:18.933 --> 08:20.628
Excuse me?

08:20.702 --> 08:23.500
No, no, not that she has a reputation.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.038
I always heard she's very hot.

08:25.907 --> 08:27.670
Not hot as in hot.

08:27.742 --> 08:29.710
Hot, I meant warm...
Warm-hearted.

08:29.777 --> 08:33.679
And she likes to go out
and have fun, festive times,

08:33.748 --> 08:36.979
in bars, with a lot
of different guys, and...

08:37.051 --> 08:40.020
That's the old Violet Nottingham.
Before she met me.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.818
Now it's up to me to keep
my pooky-bear out of the spotlight

08:42.890 --> 08:46.485
and nightclubs and tabloids.
Isn't that right, sir?

08:46.561 --> 08:49.496
Violet's off to her private tennis
lesson with Roger Federer.

08:49.564 --> 08:52.226
- Oh. All right, good for you.
- Bye, boys.

08:52.300 --> 08:54.962
Got to say, uh...

08:55.036 --> 08:58.597
...it's gonna be hard for me to see
the hotel move locations like this.

08:58.673 --> 09:02.109
Well, I, I do hope you'll feel able
to come and work with us there.

09:02.176 --> 09:04.201
Big as Kendall wants to make it,

09:04.278 --> 09:07.042
well, there's going to be a lot
of light bulbs to change.

09:08.349 --> 09:10.510
Someone touched me.
Is there any sanitizer?

09:10.585 --> 09:13.076
There is, sir. Come this way.
I'll get you some.

09:13.154 --> 09:14.917
Can't be too careful, Kendall.

09:24.432 --> 09:26.798
All right, everyone finished
at the pottery table,

09:26.868 --> 09:28.392
bring their art to the kiln.

09:28.469 --> 09:31.063
The man with the rescue donkey's
leaving in five minutes,

09:31.139 --> 09:32.868
if you haven't gotten a ride, hurry up.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.168
Thank you, Principal Duva.

09:34.242 --> 09:36.710
Oh, I'm not a principal
at this party. I'm a mom.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.307
Hey!

09:39.380 --> 09:42.645
I notice no one's eating
the gluten-free wheatgrass cake.

09:42.717 --> 09:46.175
Come on. Trust me,
you just got to get past the smell.

09:50.158 --> 09:52.490
What? The clown died?

09:52.560 --> 09:55.256
- What's in that bag?
- Oh, chocolate chip cookie.

09:55.329 --> 09:58.457
- Food!
- Food!

09:58.533 --> 10:01.400
- Slow it down, slow it down.
- Hey, sissy.

10:01.469 --> 10:05.530
Why do you bring sugary, chemical-filled
crud to my house every time you visit?

10:05.606 --> 10:08.632
What? Every time? You haven't
invited me here in four years.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.143
What are you talking about?
It hasn't been four years.

10:11.212 --> 10:13.305
You were here for
The Fourth of July barbecue

10:13.381 --> 10:14.678
when you punched my husband?

10:14.749 --> 10:17.513
Yes. That was four years ago.
I wanted to give him a wedgie,

10:17.585 --> 10:19.314
but his underwear had holes in it.

10:19.387 --> 10:22.185
I knew he'd be your ex-husband.
You should be happy.

10:22.256 --> 10:23.621
All right. Let's not start.

10:23.691 --> 10:25.283
How are the kids handling

10:25.359 --> 10:26.792
the old divorce anyways?

10:26.861 --> 10:29.921
They're both kind of off right now.
Bobbi's been really quiet.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.488
Why don't you go say hi.
I'm gonna pay the donkey guy.

10:32.567 --> 10:35.127
- Is that what stinks in here?
- No, it's the cake.

10:35.203 --> 10:36.966
What did she make, donkey cake?

10:37.038 --> 10:40.132
I smell manure.

10:40.208 --> 10:42.904
Hey, you guys. Remember me?

10:44.045 --> 10:45.376
Uncle Skeeter.

10:45.446 --> 10:48.882
Man, you got big.
Haven't seen you in a while.

10:48.950 --> 10:51.612
Happy birthday there, Bobbi.

10:51.686 --> 10:54.154
I'm Patrick. She's Bobbi.

10:54.222 --> 10:55.883
Oh, my bad.

10:55.957 --> 10:59.051
Got you a little something.
Happy birthday, Bobbi.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.686
Here you go.
Picked it up at the hotel.

11:02.763 --> 11:03.889
How's school going?

11:03.965 --> 11:06.297
- Skeeter?
- Yeah.

11:06.367 --> 11:08.892
Getting called to the principal's
office. Look at that.

11:08.970 --> 11:11.029
Have fun with the gifts. And...

11:11.973 --> 11:13.463
Yes, yes.

11:14.175 --> 11:15.802
Shampoo?

11:17.111 --> 11:18.601
And a soap?

11:19.380 --> 11:21.678
Hanger and a towel.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.774
Do not talk about school with them.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.149
What's going on with the school?

11:26.220 --> 11:28.245
- They're closing it down.
- No.

11:28.322 --> 11:30.950
- I'm getting laid off.
- You?

11:31.025 --> 11:33.493
You're like
the classic school principal.

11:33.561 --> 11:36.189
I mean, you're, you're scary
and bad with people.

11:36.264 --> 11:37.856
Children are nervous around you.

11:37.932 --> 11:41.333
That doesn't sound right, but,
I'm just saying, what else could you do?

11:41.402 --> 11:45.202
Maybe, Cuban dictator? Or the bogeyman.
You could be the bogeyman.

11:45.273 --> 11:46.934
- Anyway...
- What, what?

11:47.008 --> 11:49.033
I've got some interviews
set up in Arizona,

11:49.110 --> 11:51.635
which is kind of what I wanted
to talk to you about.

11:51.712 --> 11:53.179
Uh-oh.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.841
I need you to watch the kids...
for a week.

11:55.917 --> 11:58.852
No! No, they don't even like me!

11:58.920 --> 12:00.751
It's not going to be difficult, Skeeter.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.721
My friend Jill
is a teacher at my school.

12:02.790 --> 12:06.021
She'll bring the kids in with her
and watch them till dinnertime.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.720
All you gotta do is the night shift.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.456
Why can't your stupid friend do that?

12:09.530 --> 12:12.260
She's got night school. Skeeter!

12:12.333 --> 12:14.824
My husband left me.
I'm getting laid off.

12:14.902 --> 12:17.962
I, I have to move.
I need your help.

12:18.039 --> 12:20.633
So you need me.
This is good.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.005
I'll do it.

12:22.076 --> 12:23.771
But you got to say,

12:23.844 --> 12:25.812
"Skeeter is the coolest.
I am a nerd."

12:25.880 --> 12:27.745
"Skeeter's the coolest.
I'm a nerd?"

12:27.815 --> 12:30.978
Yeah, you are! Whoo!

12:31.052 --> 12:32.349
OK. Hey, you guys.

12:32.420 --> 12:34.684
I'm going to hang out with you
this week. All right?

12:34.755 --> 12:36.552
Maybe we can go... fishing.

12:36.624 --> 12:39.491
I'd rather you didn't.
Patrick's not a strong swimmer.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.891
OK, we'll stay inside.

12:40.962 --> 12:42.987
How about, uh,
we play some poker?

12:43.064 --> 12:46.227
- I can teach you that.
- Gambling? I don't think so.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.825
OK, how about we
just take walks in the park

12:48.903 --> 12:51.997
- and catalog plant species?
- Now you're talking.

12:52.073 --> 12:53.734
I don't know anything about plants

12:53.808 --> 12:55.742
except you try to make cakes
out of them!

12:55.810 --> 12:57.937
He liked that one.
I'm gonna end with a laugh.

12:58.012 --> 13:01.175
Give me some. Huh?

13:01.248 --> 13:04.149
I wasn't gonna hit you.
I was trying to do the fist thing.

13:04.218 --> 13:05.947
You don't know the fist thing?

13:06.020 --> 13:07.487
OK, I was just...

13:08.456 --> 13:10.947
That's what, uh, the children do.

13:11.659 --> 13:13.024
Hey, yeh, yeh.

13:16.364 --> 13:17.831
Oh, this your truck, chief?

13:17.898 --> 13:19.593
Yes, it is, ma'am.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.158
You realize you're taking up
two parking spaces?

13:22.236 --> 13:23.931
It's a big truck, ma'am.

13:24.005 --> 13:26.701
It's not that big, sir.
You could fit into one spot.

13:26.774 --> 13:28.799
I had to park
all the way down the block.

13:28.876 --> 13:31.709
Well, next time park in that box.
Plenty of room in there.

13:31.779 --> 13:35.875
Anyway, here's the situation.
This is not really my truck,

13:35.950 --> 13:38.043
this is the hotel I work for's truck.

13:38.119 --> 13:41.179
So if I get a scratch on it,
they take it out of my salary.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.122
So two parking spaces
provides me with what I call

13:44.191 --> 13:47.627
"a cushion of protection."

13:47.695 --> 13:50.687
Wait, a hotel? Oh, wait.
You're Wendy's brother.

13:50.765 --> 13:52.733
- Yeah.
- I'm Jill.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.132
- Who's that?
- I'm her friend,

13:55.202 --> 13:58.000
the one helping take care of the kids.
I'm the day shift.

13:58.072 --> 14:02.805
OK, June. You plan on being
this hostile the whole time?

14:02.877 --> 14:04.674
Jill. My name is Jill.

14:04.745 --> 14:07.339
Do you plan on keeping that
haircut the rest of the time?

14:07.415 --> 14:11.112
Oh, haven't you heard?
Goofy's the new handsome.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.386
- That sounds good for the environment.
- Oh, we can't all have Priuses.

14:19.460 --> 14:21.860
How do you know I drive a Prius?

14:21.929 --> 14:24.864
Your whole aura reads Prius.

14:27.535 --> 14:30.026
Anyways, you're in my
cushion of protection right now.

14:30.104 --> 14:33.130
I want to back up, so if you
could just zing-zang up there,

14:33.207 --> 14:36.074
- that would be helpful.
- Yeah.

14:36.143 --> 14:38.338
You might want some Cinnabons.
You'll need it.

14:38.412 --> 14:41.506
Food!

14:41.582 --> 14:45.882
Give it back!
Somebody owes me six bucks!

14:45.953 --> 14:50.652
So why didn't you demand that he make
you the big boss of the new hotel?

14:50.724 --> 14:52.021
He promised your dad.

14:52.093 --> 14:54.459
I wanted to.
It just wasn't the right time.

14:54.528 --> 14:55.893
Let me tell you how it works.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.726
The big man's giving the job
to Kendall

14:57.798 --> 14:59.356
because he's dating his daughter.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.594
That's the way it works,
keep it in the family.

15:01.669 --> 15:04.433
He gets the girl, he gets the job,
he gets everything.

15:04.505 --> 15:05.767
And I get nothing.

15:12.046 --> 15:14.207
- Hello?
- <i> Where are you? Still there?</i>

15:14.281 --> 15:15.942
I'm still where?
Who's this?

15:16.016 --> 15:19.042
<i>Look, I've got to get to class.</i>
<i>The kids are waiting for you, OK?</i>

15:19.120 --> 15:21.213
Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.052
I forgot.
I'll be there in like 20 minutes.

15:25.292 --> 15:28.352
I'm gonna baby-sit
my nephew and niece tonight.

15:28.429 --> 15:32.058
Oh, God.
Got any advice for me?

15:32.133 --> 15:34.727
Yes, I do. Sometimes I baby-sit
my cousins, right?

15:34.802 --> 15:37.032
And what I do is
I let them style me hair.

15:37.104 --> 15:40.335
Like put beads into it and braid it,
make me look all real sexy.

15:40.407 --> 15:43.604
Like Milli Vanilli, stuff like that.
You should try that.

15:43.677 --> 15:46.578
Braid my hair? That's a good idea.
Can I have some French fries?

15:46.647 --> 15:49.275
Of course you can.
You're my best friend.

15:51.085 --> 15:53.645
Ah! Actually, I really like
ketchup on my face

15:53.721 --> 15:55.655
because it's
rejuvenating for the skin.

15:55.723 --> 15:58.214
So who's the real victim?
You are.

15:58.292 --> 16:00.954
Mmm! Delicious.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.929
Do you think these signs will help?

16:07.001 --> 16:09.401
Well, miracles happen,
you know?

16:09.470 --> 16:11.631
You mean like Dad coming back?

16:11.705 --> 16:13.036
Um...

16:16.544 --> 16:20.139
Hey!
Sorry I'm late.

16:20.214 --> 16:22.148
So, um, their pajamas
are on their beds,

16:22.216 --> 16:25.777
and I will be back, um,
at 8:30 to pick them up, OK?

16:25.853 --> 16:28.617
- All right.
- Here is my cell phone number.

16:28.689 --> 16:31.214
And call me if there's
any emergencies.

16:31.292 --> 16:34.090
All right. Have fun at night school.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.186
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

16:36.263 --> 16:38.424
All packed up here.

16:38.499 --> 16:41.866
I got my, uh, toothbrush
and, uh, and the toothpaste.

16:43.938 --> 16:45.337
Some clean underwear.

16:46.540 --> 16:48.508
Well, maybe not that clean.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.002
You guys want to watch TV?

16:52.079 --> 16:53.979
We don't have a TV.

16:55.282 --> 16:57.307
- Hello?
- <i> Emergency!</i>

16:59.186 --> 17:00.585
They don't have a TV.

17:00.654 --> 17:03.088
Wendy doesn't let them watch TV.
You didn't know?

17:03.157 --> 17:05.147
I don't know a lot of things
about these kids.

17:05.226 --> 17:07.922
I wasn't allowed over here.
Their old man didn't like me.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.089
OK, listen, you don't need a TV.
You can, um, play a game, do a puzzle.

17:11.165 --> 17:13.429
I'm sure you can figure
something out. OK?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.333
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Should I let them
braid my hair or something?

17:16.403 --> 17:17.961
Would they like that?

17:18.038 --> 17:20.301
I don't think anyone
should touch that hair.

17:23.377 --> 17:27.540
Hey, what do you say we go...

17:27.615 --> 17:31.051
next door and toilet paper
your neighbor's trees?

17:32.152 --> 17:35.019
No? OK, bedtime!

17:45.899 --> 17:47.799
OK, so you guys cool?

17:47.868 --> 17:50.359
You have to read us a bedtime story.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.803
Yeah, all right. You have any?

17:54.108 --> 17:58.602
Whoo! What do you got here, anyways?

17:58.679 --> 18:01.739
<i>"Rainbow Alligator Saves the Wetlands"?</i>

18:01.815 --> 18:03.976
Mmm, no.

18:04.051 --> 18:07.418
<i>"The Organic Squirrel</i>
<i>Gets a Bike Helmet"?</i>

18:07.488 --> 18:10.013
I'm not reading these
communist books to you guys.

18:10.090 --> 18:11.614
Don't you got any real stories?

18:11.692 --> 18:13.990
- Like what?
- Like what?

18:14.061 --> 18:16.495
Like, like cowboys? Or dragons?

18:16.563 --> 18:19.794
Or aliens? Or... What the heck
is on my head right now?

18:19.867 --> 18:22.995
That's Bugsy, our guinea pig.

18:23.070 --> 18:26.005
- Why do you call him Bugsy?
- Because of his eyes.

18:26.073 --> 18:27.802
Let me see them.

18:29.977 --> 18:34.676
Wow! Those eyes would be big on a cow.

18:36.684 --> 18:38.982
Are those eyeballs
or bowling balls?

18:39.053 --> 18:41.021
Can't keep my eyes off of them.

18:41.088 --> 18:44.683
Just get in there so I don't have to
look at them anymore. Goodbye.

18:44.758 --> 18:46.385
Anyways, uh,

18:46.460 --> 18:49.224
you guys want me to, uh,
make up a story for you?

18:49.296 --> 18:51.230
Like, like my old man used to do for me?

18:51.298 --> 18:52.822
Maybe I could be good at this.

18:54.702 --> 18:57.330
All right, um...

18:57.404 --> 18:58.598
Here goes.

18:58.672 --> 19:03.871
Once upon a time,
in a magical, faraway kingdom...

19:05.346 --> 19:08.645
<i>... there was a brave</i>
<i>and noble knight.</i>

19:08.716 --> 19:11.651
<i>Strikingly handsome.</i>

19:11.719 --> 19:13.516
<i>Who lived in a grand castle</i>

19:13.587 --> 19:19.116
<i>that weary travelers from near and far</i>
<i>would come and visit.</i>

19:19.193 --> 19:23.186
<i>Now, this knight had been</i>
<i>working his butt off for years.</i>

19:23.263 --> 19:26.061
<i>You'd think he'd be a shoo-in</i>
<i>to rule the castle, right?</i>

19:26.133 --> 19:28.226
- <i> Right.</i>
- <i> Wrong.</i>

19:28.302 --> 19:33.296
<i>Actually, he wasn't</i>
<i>even a knight at all.</i>

19:34.708 --> 19:36.573
Oh, no.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.906
<i> He was, in fact,</i>
<i>just a lowly peasant.</i>

19:41.982 --> 19:45.213
<i>And even though he was the son</i>
<i>of the late, great Lord Marty...</i>

19:45.285 --> 19:46.980
Thank you.

19:47.054 --> 19:51.115
<i>... and knew everything there is</i>
<i>to know about running a castle,</i>

19:51.191 --> 19:54.160
<i>everyone just took him for granted.</i>

19:54.228 --> 19:58.255
<i>His name was Mr. Underappreciated.</i>

19:58.332 --> 20:00.266
What's "underdemeciated"?

20:00.334 --> 20:03.098
- Under de-what?
- Underdemeciated.

20:03.170 --> 20:05.400
That's right,
I forgot you were six.

20:05.472 --> 20:08.771
His name was Sir... Fix-A-Lot.

20:08.842 --> 20:11.811
<i>But alas, the kingdom</i>
<i>where Sir Fix-A-Lot lived</i>

20:11.879 --> 20:16.043
<i>did not place much value on dedication</i>
<i>or hard work, I guess.</i>

20:16.116 --> 20:21.645
<i>Because the superstar in all</i>
<i>the land was Sir Butt-Kiss.</i>

20:21.722 --> 20:25.590
<i>And he spent all his days</i>
<i>kissing everybody's butt.</i>

20:27.494 --> 20:29.291
Boo!

20:29.363 --> 20:31.854
And my lord, yes,
of course I can get you

20:31.932 --> 20:35.129
front row house seats
to <i>The Lion King.</i>

20:35.202 --> 20:38.035
And Sir Fix-A-Lot had
a best friend, Friar Fred,

20:38.105 --> 20:40.039
who was not right in the head.

20:40.107 --> 20:44.476
She never! No! Not our queen,
I won't have that.

20:44.545 --> 20:48.276
- Were there any kids in the kingdom?
- Yes, yes. Of course.

20:49.450 --> 20:51.315
<i>There were two young pages.</i>

20:51.385 --> 20:54.946
Mistress Stinky
and Master Smelly.

20:55.022 --> 20:57.889
Hey-oh! And don't forget...

20:57.958 --> 21:00.392
Jillian! The queen of the fairies!

21:00.461 --> 21:02.190
<i> Queen of the fairies?</i>

21:02.262 --> 21:05.561
<i>I mean, if she has to be there,</i>
<i>let's just make her an angry raven.</i>

21:08.836 --> 21:11.270
Parking spot!

21:11.338 --> 21:13.602
<i> She should be</i>
<i>a mermaid teacher.</i>

21:13.674 --> 21:16.234
<i> Yeah. The best</i>
<i>mermaid teacher in the world.</i>

21:16.310 --> 21:18.938
Children, open your books to page 16.

21:19.012 --> 21:20.445
Yes, Miss Mermaid.

21:20.514 --> 21:21.776
Let's begin.

21:21.849 --> 21:24.113
All right, she's a mermaid.
Whatever you want.

21:24.184 --> 21:25.651
Anyways, back to the story.

21:25.719 --> 21:29.883
One day the king invited
all his subjects to the castle.

21:29.957 --> 21:31.788
I bring glad tidings.

21:31.859 --> 21:34.419
For on this day
I have chosen a champion

21:34.495 --> 21:36.554
who will run this castle

21:36.630 --> 21:41.033
and be my closest advisor
and bestest buddy.

21:41.101 --> 21:43.831
My new champion is...

21:43.904 --> 21:45.269
...Sir Butt-Kiss!

21:55.415 --> 21:56.814
Thank you.

21:56.884 --> 22:01.218
Poor Sir Fix-A-Lot had been passed over.

22:01.288 --> 22:05.588
<i>So, Sir Fix-A-Lot</i>
<i>moved into a giant shoe,</i>

22:05.659 --> 22:09.186
<i>got a bad case of athlete's face,</i>

22:09.263 --> 22:10.457
<i>dove into a moat...</i>

22:10.531 --> 22:12.499
Ah, what the heck.

22:12.566 --> 22:14.295
<i>... and got eaten by crocodiles.</i>

22:16.203 --> 22:17.636
The end.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.969
The end? That can't be the end.

22:21.041 --> 22:23.305
- Why? Why not?
- It's not happy.

22:23.377 --> 22:26.904
There aren't happy endings in real life.
Sooner you know that, the better.

22:26.980 --> 22:29.710
- It's not fair!
- What? What's not fair?

22:29.783 --> 22:33.844
I mean, shouldn't Sir Fix-A-Lot
at least get a shot to be champion?

22:33.921 --> 22:37.322
- A shot? Hmm...
- If Sir Fix-A-Lot is better

22:37.391 --> 22:40.360
than Sir Butt-Kiss, he should
get a chance to prove it.

22:40.427 --> 22:42.861
OK. Yeah, yeah,
Bobbi, good.

22:42.930 --> 22:44.727
What the king
really said was...

22:44.798 --> 22:47.232
On second thought,

22:47.301 --> 22:50.361
there is another worthy man
in my kingdom,

22:50.437 --> 22:53.929
and it wouldn't be fair
unless he got a shot, too.

22:54.007 --> 22:56.908
Sir Fix-A-Lot!

22:56.977 --> 22:59.036
<i> And then the crowd went nuts.</i>

23:01.448 --> 23:05.942
But, Sire, Fix-A-Lot
is as common as muck.

23:06.019 --> 23:07.213
Boo!

23:07.287 --> 23:10.256
<i> And Friar Fred</i>
<i>drop-kicked a booing goblin.</i>

23:10.324 --> 23:13.191
Boo!

23:13.260 --> 23:17.321
And the mermaid teacher did one of those
weird tail dolphin moves.

23:20.067 --> 23:22.627
And Stinky and Smelly
did the fastest Irish jig ever.

23:22.703 --> 23:25.763
<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!</i>

23:25.839 --> 23:28.467
Yeah. Right on.

23:28.542 --> 23:31.807
<i>Prince Bugsy busted out</i>
<i>some fancy moves.</i>

23:33.380 --> 23:34.813
And then... and then...

23:34.881 --> 23:36.872
It started raining gumballs.

23:40.387 --> 23:42.116
Raining gumballs?

23:42.189 --> 23:45.317
Why not? It's a bedtime story.
Anything can happen.

23:45.392 --> 23:48.418
Yeah, yeah.
I guess in a story.

23:48.495 --> 23:51.794
I just wish it was like that
in real life. I really do.

23:53.166 --> 23:56.158
- What was that?
- Bugsy.

23:56.236 --> 23:58.227
Oh.

23:58.305 --> 23:59.966
He rings that bell when he's hungry?

24:00.040 --> 24:03.339
No, when he needs to go to sleep.

24:09.549 --> 24:12.541
OK. As you wish,
Your Highness.

24:16.323 --> 24:20.453
All right, you guys, have a good sleep.
You, too, uh, weird eyes.

24:27.668 --> 24:30.831
Well, I don't
have much to work with,

24:30.904 --> 24:33.031
but I will make us

24:33.106 --> 24:36.303
a delicious breakfast

24:36.376 --> 24:38.970
that I know you will enjoy.

24:39.046 --> 24:42.072
Yes, some banana
on the rice cake,

24:42.149 --> 24:44.709
and then what do we call this?
Wheat germ.

24:44.785 --> 24:47.481
I was told germs are bad for you,
but here goes.

24:48.889 --> 24:50.720
I like it.

24:50.791 --> 24:53.385
A rice cake-banana-wheat germ sandwich.

24:53.460 --> 24:54.984
And what do we got?

25:00.634 --> 25:02.226
This is terrible.

25:02.302 --> 25:04.702
Doesn't your, your mother
have taste buds?

25:04.771 --> 25:07.535
What are we doing here?
We got nothing to use in this house.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.199
Hang on.

25:10.877 --> 25:12.640
A little flavor.

25:14.548 --> 25:17.676
It's good because, now we don't
have to brush our teeth.

25:19.886 --> 25:23.344
There you go. At least we got
a little mint going on. Guys want one?

25:24.458 --> 25:26.426
Hang on.

25:28.962 --> 25:31.829
Hello!

25:31.898 --> 25:34.526
Bronson? The television set
in Mr. Nottingham's room

25:34.601 --> 25:36.728
is broken and it needs
to be fixed right away.

25:36.803 --> 25:39.897
I have a situation here.
I'm watching my nephew and my niece.

25:39.973 --> 25:42.407
I'm sorry. Are you having
difficulty hearing me?

25:42.476 --> 25:45.001
Mr. Nottingham wants
to watch television now!

25:45.078 --> 25:47.512
I hear you.
I speak trollinese, don't worry.

25:47.581 --> 25:50.516
<i>There's a leprechaun behind you.</i>

25:50.584 --> 25:52.313
Gotcha.

25:55.455 --> 25:57.753
Thanks a lot, gentlemen. OK.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.189
- Wow.
- It's pretty, huh?

25:59.259 --> 26:00.248
Whoa!

26:00.327 --> 26:04.286
I got to go fix my boss' television set,
but I need somebody to watch you two.

26:04.364 --> 26:07.094
Violet!
Right here. Give a smile.

26:07.167 --> 26:08.532
Hang on.

26:08.602 --> 26:12.231
Violet! Skeeter Bronson,
the handyman from the other day.

26:12.305 --> 26:14.034
Oh, right. Yes.

26:14.107 --> 26:16.405
Listen, uh, I got some kids
with me right now.

26:16.476 --> 26:18.967
My nephew and niece. But,
I gotta fix your father's TV.

26:19.045 --> 26:20.706
Could you watch them a few minutes?

26:20.781 --> 26:22.146
Huh?

26:23.650 --> 26:25.948
Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm going.

26:26.019 --> 26:28.817
Come in.

26:30.757 --> 26:34.284
- Mr. Nottingham, sir?
- Uh, the telly won't turn on.

26:34.361 --> 26:37.922
It won't? Well, let me just
take a... tallyho at it, OK?

26:37.998 --> 26:39.761
I'll just flip this light on.

26:39.833 --> 26:43.428
No, no, no, no!
Absolutely not!

26:43.503 --> 26:44.970
I'm fighting a cold here.

26:45.038 --> 26:47.370
I must stay in the dark
whenever possible.

26:47.440 --> 26:48.930
Do you realize

26:49.009 --> 26:52.911
germs can reproduce
80 percent faster in bright light?

26:52.979 --> 26:55.812
Oh, OK. Here we go,
nice and dark again.

26:55.882 --> 26:58.248
- The germs are confused.
- Come towards me.

26:58.318 --> 27:01.116
OK. It's got to be
around here somewhere.

27:03.623 --> 27:04.988
For heaven's sake.

27:05.058 --> 27:07.492
I'm so sorry, sir.
I just can't see a thing.

27:07.561 --> 27:09.756
- To your left, there.
- Oh!

27:09.830 --> 27:13.322
There's the TV. So how's the,
uh, new hotel coming, sir?

27:13.400 --> 27:17.427
Oh, very well. Still dealing with the
city on building permits and whatnot.

27:17.504 --> 27:18.971
Uh-huh.

27:19.039 --> 27:20.768
I can't tell you the secret theme.

27:20.841 --> 27:23.207
It's so good, we don't want
anyone to steal it.

27:23.276 --> 27:26.211
- I hear you, sir.
- OK, I'll tell you.

27:26.279 --> 27:28.304
Come along, sit down. Please.

27:28.381 --> 27:29.712
Great.

27:30.584 --> 27:32.347
Ready?

27:33.720 --> 27:36.245
Rock and roll.

27:36.323 --> 27:39.315
Vintage vinyl.
Music memorabilia in the lobby.

27:39.392 --> 27:42.623
Oh, OK. Like, uh, like the Hard Rock?

27:42.696 --> 27:45.460
- The What What?
- The Hard Rock Hotel.

27:45.532 --> 27:48.524
They've been using
that theme for, like, years.

27:49.736 --> 27:54.537
Get Kendall Duncan
up here straightaway, please.

27:54.608 --> 27:56.838
What a perfect
little powder puff.

28:00.814 --> 28:01.838
Thank you.

28:01.915 --> 28:05.407
So, Patrick, truth or dare?

28:05.485 --> 28:07.715
Truth?

28:07.787 --> 28:10.915
How old were you the first time
you kissed a girl?

28:10.991 --> 28:13.050
Patrick never kissed a girl.

28:13.126 --> 28:15.094
Girls are bis-crusting.

28:15.962 --> 28:18.829
Except for Trisha Sparks.

28:18.899 --> 28:21.732
Ooh, is that a girl in your class,
you little Romeo?

28:21.801 --> 28:22.927
Hey, guys.

28:23.003 --> 28:25.369
Hi, Aunt Jill, did you
get the note we left you?

28:25.438 --> 28:27.269
Yes, I did.

28:27.340 --> 28:30.241
And, uh, now we have to get you guys
ready for school. So, come on.

28:30.310 --> 28:32.278
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.414
Oh, hey. You're, uh...

28:35.482 --> 28:39.942
- Uh-huh. Here's your fat mouse.
- It's a guinea pig, but...

28:40.020 --> 28:43.148
And you, young man...

28:43.223 --> 28:47.990
I want to hear all about this little
Trisha Sparks next time I see you.

28:51.364 --> 28:53.389
Trisha Sparks is
two years older than you.

28:53.466 --> 28:55.832
She's hot.

28:57.871 --> 29:02.968
I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.
We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.

29:03.043 --> 29:08.310
This rock and roll idea
of yours is old hat.

29:08.381 --> 29:12.943
Well, sir, I had every intention
of putting our own spin on it.

29:13.019 --> 29:14.316
Do you know what, Skeeter?

29:14.387 --> 29:17.015
I'm starting to get a fuzzy recollection

29:17.090 --> 29:19.217
of something I said to your father.

29:19.292 --> 29:23.160
In fact, I am going to give you a shot.

29:24.965 --> 29:28.401
If you can come up with a better theme
than Kendall does,

29:28.468 --> 29:30.663
I'll let you run the new place instead.

29:30.737 --> 29:33.001
Oh, sir.

29:33.073 --> 29:36.008
Don't you think this is perhaps
a little too much of a cruel joke

29:36.076 --> 29:39.239
to be playing on somebody as...
well, the, the maintenance guy?

29:39.312 --> 29:41.576
- No, I don't.
- No.

29:41.648 --> 29:46.483
Mr. Bronson has been working
for this company for 25 years.

29:46.553 --> 29:50.956
I'm beginning to think I may have
seriously underdemeciated him.

29:51.024 --> 29:53.322
I'm sorry.
"Underdemeciated"?

29:53.393 --> 29:58.797
Precisely. You can both present your
ideas at my birthday party this weekend.

29:58.865 --> 30:01.333
Thank you, Kendall.
That is all.

30:01.401 --> 30:03.835
Mr. Bronson, the television,
if you would.

30:03.903 --> 30:06.838
Oh, and do watch out
for the germ vaporizer.

30:09.709 --> 30:11.939
The best day of my life!

30:12.012 --> 30:14.276
<i># Amadeus Amadeus</i>

30:14.347 --> 30:17.316
<i># Amadeus Ow! Amadeus</i>
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah!</i>

30:17.384 --> 30:20.353
<i># Amadeus Amadeus Amadeus</i>

30:20.420 --> 30:22.820
<i># Ooh, rock me Amadeus</i>

30:22.889 --> 30:25.653
<i># Amadeus Amadeus</i>

30:27.427 --> 30:29.725
Whoa. I like your car, pal.

30:29.796 --> 30:31.730
Hey, thanks, champ.
You know what they say.

30:31.798 --> 30:34.130
You want to be the best,
you got to drive the best.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.963
Hey, uh, not to get personal,

30:36.036 --> 30:38.698
but what's a sweet ride
like that cost, anyways?

30:38.772 --> 30:41.468
You know what? Actually it's
surprisingly affordable.

30:41.541 --> 30:42.530
Yeah?

30:42.609 --> 30:45.737
If you saved every paycheck you
earn for the rest of your life

30:45.812 --> 30:49.145
and then multiply it by ten, you
could probably buy my muffler.

30:50.917 --> 30:53.317
Ah-ooga!

30:53.386 --> 30:55.752
Oh, you wanna drag race, do you?

30:59.492 --> 31:02.256
You win! Good job.

31:22.816 --> 31:24.579
What?

31:53.346 --> 31:55.337
This is spooky.

32:02.489 --> 32:05.856
You've got to be kidding me!
Look at this. I'm losing all my candy.

32:05.925 --> 32:09.884
How can you not see
a 50-foot trailer? Come on.

32:13.933 --> 32:17.835
So you have to compete for your job with
Skeeter Bronson. You'll annihilate him.

32:17.904 --> 32:20.896
Oh, I know. It's just
a little degrading, that's all.

32:23.576 --> 32:25.942
Thanks for being there.

32:26.012 --> 32:30.312
I'll be there as long as
there's a there to be at.

32:33.987 --> 32:35.284
Oh, hello, children.

32:35.355 --> 32:37.414
We're looking for Skeeter Bronson.

32:37.490 --> 32:39.685
Oh, Mr. Bronson.

32:39.759 --> 32:41.954
Yes, you'll find him in room 109.

32:42.028 --> 32:44.121
- OK.
- Please, this way.

32:54.174 --> 32:56.972
- Oh, my God! Did you see that thing?
- Those eyes.

32:57.043 --> 32:59.978
They were, they were staring
into my, my very soul.

33:01.548 --> 33:03.448
- Hey, Uncle Skeeter!
- Hey!

33:03.516 --> 33:06.974
- Just who I wanted to see.
- Hey, chief, here's Bugsy.

33:07.053 --> 33:08.680
- Got him.
- Why do they have to stay here?

33:08.755 --> 33:10.723
Because I'm on call tonight,
Jennifer.

33:10.790 --> 33:13.054
It's Jill, actually, Scooter.

33:13.126 --> 33:14.457
It is? OK, yeah...

33:16.996 --> 33:18.361
You did not just do that.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.160
I did. Watch.
I'm gonna do it again.

33:21.801 --> 33:25.066
So, guys, anything weird
happen to you today?

33:25.138 --> 33:28.335
I had a substitute teacher
with an eye patch.

33:28.408 --> 33:31.434
Uh... that's a little weird.
I'm talking like big-time weird.

33:31.511 --> 33:33.945
Maybe coincidence weird, uh...

33:34.013 --> 33:36.914
...as in gumball weird?

33:36.983 --> 33:38.814
We're not allowed to chew gum.

33:38.885 --> 33:42.252
Of course you're not.
You guys want to go to sleep?

33:42.322 --> 33:43.846
It's only 5:30.

33:43.923 --> 33:45.356
And we haven't had dinner.

33:45.425 --> 33:48.394
Hmm. OK.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.723
Room service!

33:49.796 --> 33:53.664
So you've never
been skateboarding?

33:53.733 --> 33:55.257
You've never played video games?

33:55.335 --> 33:57.530
Mom says they rot your brain.

33:57.604 --> 34:01.973
That's not true. I've been playing video
games my whole life, and look at me.

34:04.277 --> 34:06.768
Yeah, maybe she's got a point.

34:06.846 --> 34:09.406
You. You've never eaten bacon?

34:09.482 --> 34:11.382
What's bacon?

34:11.451 --> 34:14.420
Bacon is the juicy,
fatty part of the pig

34:14.487 --> 34:16.681
right adjacent to the rear.

34:16.755 --> 34:21.625
But delicious and tasty,
not how I just made it sound.

34:21.694 --> 34:25.357
And this is the first hamburger
you've ever eaten?

34:25.431 --> 34:28.628
- What's the verdict? What do you think?
- Life-changing.

34:28.701 --> 34:31.067
- Mom's gonna kill us.
- No, she isn't.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.605
First of all, she's never
gonna find out about this.

34:33.672 --> 34:36.870
And second of all, she used to eat
plenty of hamburgers

34:36.943 --> 34:39.036
when we were growing up
in this very room.

34:39.112 --> 34:41.444
She did?

34:41.514 --> 34:44.677
Looks like Bugsy's eaten a lot
of burgers in the last ten minutes.

34:46.652 --> 34:47.641
Wow!

34:47.719 --> 34:50.553
He keeps going like that,
we could make bacon out of Bugsy.

34:52.125 --> 34:54.491
He's kidding, Bugsy.
Take it easy.

34:54.560 --> 34:57.757
OK. Let's get you carnivores to bed.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.821
I got a, a new story
I want to lay on you.

34:59.899 --> 35:01.764
What do you think
of cowboys and Indians?

35:01.834 --> 35:04.564
Oh, yes, tonight's the night!

35:04.637 --> 35:07.333
I just like cowboys and Indians
'cause of the conflict.

35:07.407 --> 35:10.874
OK, once upon a time in the Old West,

35:10.943 --> 35:13.434
before room service was
even invented...

35:13.513 --> 35:16.971
<i>... there was a farm hand</i>
<i>named Jeremiah Skeets.</i>

35:17.050 --> 35:19.109
<i>He was looking to get</i>
<i>ahead in the world,</i>

35:19.185 --> 35:20.447
<i>but was having a problem</i>

35:20.520 --> 35:22.613
<i>with his current mode</i>
<i>of transportation.</i>

35:26.092 --> 35:29.391
Uh, that was my horse.
That wasn't me, everybody.

35:30.763 --> 35:33.061
<i>Someone once told Jeremiah</i>

35:33.132 --> 35:35.327
<i>that if he wanted to be the best,</i>

35:35.401 --> 35:37.892
<i>he'd have to ride the best.</i>

35:37.970 --> 35:39.995
You mind showing me your finest horse?

35:44.277 --> 35:48.373
My ancestors believe horse spirit

35:48.448 --> 35:52.714
come down from mountain
during time of fire, wind.

35:53.853 --> 35:58.415
Many brave warrior
walk trail of moon bear...

35:58.491 --> 36:02.325
OK. Look, I just want to see your finest
horse, not a whole thing there.

36:02.395 --> 36:05.762
- Sorry. I can do it.
- All right.

36:05.832 --> 36:08.699
Screaming Rooster, bring out Ferrari.

36:08.768 --> 36:10.235
Ferrari.

36:13.072 --> 36:14.903
Oh, my.

36:14.974 --> 36:17.704
Oh, my, oh, my!

36:17.777 --> 36:19.039
Look at that.

36:19.112 --> 36:21.205
Whoa!

36:21.280 --> 36:24.977
I would get automatic respect
riding such a beautiful animal,

36:25.051 --> 36:28.145
but I'm afraid that's just
a bit out of my price range.

36:28.221 --> 36:31.349
Tell you what, white bread.

36:31.424 --> 36:34.086
I'll give you Ferrari...

36:34.827 --> 36:37.694
...for free!

36:37.764 --> 36:40.392
Boo-yah!
The end. I love it.

36:40.466 --> 36:44.232
Brilliant story.
So he got the Ferrari for free.

36:44.303 --> 36:45.861
I love that. I love that.

36:45.938 --> 36:50.272
A guy getting a free horse?
That's not a good story.

36:51.711 --> 36:55.374
Where's the arc? There's no arc.
I've not learned anything.

36:55.448 --> 36:57.848
Also, you've got
a moral obligation to them.

36:57.917 --> 36:59.942
What are they gonna
walk away from that with?

37:00.019 --> 37:03.147
I didn't know we were doing
an After School Special.

37:03.222 --> 37:05.782
Why can't he do something
a real gentleman would do,

37:05.858 --> 37:07.723
like save a damsel in distress?

37:09.061 --> 37:11.427
Not a bad idea, munchkin.

37:11.497 --> 37:15.126
OK. So, uh...
let's continue.

37:15.201 --> 37:17.761
<i> Jeremiah was</i>
<i>out for a ride when...</i>

37:19.338 --> 37:21.033
Oh, please, don't!

37:21.107 --> 37:24.907
- Give us that jewelry.
- You want my pearls? Help! Please!

37:24.977 --> 37:28.777
Yah! Yah! Yah! Whoo!

37:30.349 --> 37:33.318
Oh, my necklace? Here, take it.

37:33.386 --> 37:35.320
Come on, boy!

37:35.388 --> 37:37.288
Here.

37:37.356 --> 37:39.415
What else you got, sweetie?

37:39.492 --> 37:41.722
Help! Help!

37:45.031 --> 37:47.022
Leave the lady alone!

37:53.573 --> 37:55.632
Care for a lift, ma'am?

37:55.708 --> 37:57.471
- Yeah.
- Oh!

37:57.543 --> 38:01.912
- Nice horse.
- Oh, what, this old thing?

38:01.981 --> 38:05.007
Now, any of you gentlemen want to give
the nice lady her stuff back?

38:05.084 --> 38:06.779
Not a chance, huh?

38:06.853 --> 38:09.344
Because I beg to differ!

38:09.422 --> 38:11.617
- My hero.
- I like that.

38:13.426 --> 38:16.554
<i> So Jeremiah spirited</i>
<i>Miss Davenport away to safety,</i>

38:16.629 --> 38:17.823
<i>when she says...</i>

38:17.897 --> 38:20.263
Shall we go drink champagne
in a nearby hot tub?

38:22.768 --> 38:24.565
- Hot tub?
- Mmm.

38:24.637 --> 38:26.571
Uh, yeah. No.

38:26.639 --> 38:30.234
I was saying that because I wanted to
see if you two were paying attention.

38:32.545 --> 38:35.605
<i>What happened was Jeremiah</i>
<i>dropped Miss Davenport off</i>

38:35.681 --> 38:38.013
<i>in the nearest town, safe and sound.</i>

38:38.084 --> 38:39.813
How ever can I thank you, sir?

38:39.886 --> 38:42.116
Ah, no thanks necessary, ma'am.

38:42.188 --> 38:45.157
But I do insist on expressing
my gratitude in some manner.

38:46.225 --> 38:48.386
Fair enough. I'll take...

38:48.461 --> 38:51.726
...$100 million.

38:51.797 --> 38:54.493
The end. Let's hope it works.

38:54.567 --> 38:56.831
Very well written,
brilliantly constructed.

38:56.903 --> 39:00.134
Jeremiah wouldn't take money
for doing a good deed.

39:00.206 --> 39:03.004
Uh... I know Jeremiah
a lot better than you guys.

39:03.075 --> 39:05.566
And believe me, he'd be all over that.
He loves money.

39:05.645 --> 39:06.942
Mmm!

39:07.013 --> 39:09.481
I don't want that.
Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.

39:09.549 --> 39:11.346
Gentlemen don't get paid.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.851
Will you just...
Who's telling the story here?

39:13.920 --> 39:16.013
It should really end more like this.

39:16.088 --> 39:19.023
Well, I must give you
some token of my appreciation.

39:19.091 --> 39:20.285
Oh, no.

39:20.359 --> 39:22.452
Perhaps... a kiss?

39:23.396 --> 39:24.556
Touchdown.

39:26.165 --> 39:28.360
<i> Then an angry dwarf kicks him.</i>

39:28.434 --> 39:29.901
Ow!

39:31.003 --> 39:32.868
What the heck did you do that for?

39:32.939 --> 39:34.907
Because I'm angry.

39:34.974 --> 39:36.839
Go! Let's go!

39:37.610 --> 39:39.100
All right! Yeah!

39:40.346 --> 39:41.904
I didn't do nothing to you!

39:41.981 --> 39:44.176
- The end.
- You know what?

39:44.250 --> 39:46.582
Laugh as much as you want.
I'll take a Ferrari

39:46.652 --> 39:48.620
and a kiss any day of the week.

39:48.688 --> 39:50.485
I'd just like to kiss a Ferrari.

39:52.091 --> 39:54.958
- All right. Good night.
- Good night, Uncle Skeeter.

39:55.027 --> 39:56.551
Good night, home slice.

39:56.629 --> 39:59.257
Thanks for the stories.

39:59.332 --> 40:01.232
You came up with
all the good parts, Bobbi.

40:01.300 --> 40:03.131
Good night, y'all.

40:03.202 --> 40:04.897
You too there, Bugsy.

40:07.673 --> 40:11.302
And them braids look fantastic.
They've taken years off you.

40:11.377 --> 40:13.868
You mind sleeping over?
I'm gonna duck out a few hours.

40:13.946 --> 40:16.608
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Mmm. By the way, um,

40:16.682 --> 40:18.809
I am, uh, legally obliged to tell you

40:18.884 --> 40:22.877
that I suffer from...
sleep panic disorder.

40:22.955 --> 40:25.480
OK, what's, uh, sleep panic disorder?

40:25.558 --> 40:28.049
Believe me, you don't want to know.

40:38.037 --> 40:41.996
What am I thinking? Why would
anyone give me a free Ferrari?

40:42.074 --> 40:44.304
I must be losing my mind.

40:46.178 --> 40:48.703
Much power of the horse
underneath that hood.

40:54.687 --> 40:55.847
Hello.

40:58.090 --> 40:59.887
Are you the guy I'm supposed to see?

41:02.628 --> 41:04.789
I'm here, aren't I?

41:06.832 --> 41:11.826
So... am I about to get
a cherry red Ferrari?

41:14.674 --> 41:16.005
I don't see why not.

41:22.882 --> 41:27.751
For... free?

41:28.888 --> 41:33.825
Sounds good to... me!

41:35.261 --> 41:37.752
What do I do now?
Eat a gumball or something?

41:39.165 --> 41:40.154
Yes.

41:44.370 --> 41:46.838
- Fell out of the sky, right?
- Yeah.

41:46.906 --> 41:47.895
Shh!

41:47.973 --> 41:49.964
Oh! Shh.

41:50.042 --> 41:51.407
I won't tell nobody.

41:53.946 --> 41:57.382
Now, close your eyes
and count to three.

41:57.450 --> 41:59.213
- OK.
- Then it's all gonna happen.

41:59.285 --> 42:00.274
- No.
- Yeah.

42:01.320 --> 42:04.380
- One, two...
- Yeah.

42:04.457 --> 42:05.549
...three.

42:05.624 --> 42:07.922
Ferrari!

42:07.993 --> 42:11.053
Hey! My wallet!

42:11.130 --> 42:12.859
Not anymore!

42:16.836 --> 42:19.737
Excuse me.
Hi, boys.

42:22.942 --> 42:24.842
OK, thank you.

42:29.448 --> 42:32.440
Thanks, guys. Sorry.
I'm just trying to find my car.

42:33.986 --> 42:37.080
Good thing my wallet
only had three dollars in it.

42:37.156 --> 42:39.681
And my Derek Jeter baseball card!

42:39.759 --> 42:43.126
Guys, guys, stop, please.

42:44.363 --> 42:46.627
You've had enough, now.
Thank you.

42:46.699 --> 42:47.791
Stop!

42:55.841 --> 42:57.365
Come on, man!

42:57.443 --> 43:00.173
- Care for a lift, ma'am?
- Skeeter?

43:00.246 --> 43:02.271
- Skeeter Bronson?
- Yes, ma'am.

43:04.617 --> 43:06.244
What do you say you boys

43:06.318 --> 43:08.809
give the pretty lady back
the pictures you took?

43:10.356 --> 43:13.587
Sure about that, now?
Because I beg to differ.

43:15.394 --> 43:16.486
Guy's got a gun!

43:19.198 --> 43:21.689
I'm just happy they
didn't make me use this thing.

43:25.838 --> 43:27.999
- My hero.
- Really?

43:28.073 --> 43:30.439
That was brilliant, Skeeter.

43:30.509 --> 43:33.478
I don't know what happened.
Something came over me.

43:33.546 --> 43:35.013
It felt good.
It felt really good.

43:35.080 --> 43:36.980
How am I ever going to thank you?

43:37.049 --> 43:38.812
Hmm.

43:38.884 --> 43:41.444
No thanks is necessary, ma'am?

43:41.520 --> 43:45.251
Oh, am I in the presence
of a gentleman?

43:45.324 --> 43:47.519
At your service, ma'am.

43:47.593 --> 43:51.085
Well, I must show
my appreciation in some form.

43:55.301 --> 43:56.700
Ow!

43:56.769 --> 43:59.431
Consider yourself
big people-bashed, sucker.

43:59.505 --> 44:00.995
I knew you were gonna show up.

44:01.073 --> 44:04.270
Get in the Gremlin, Jimmy,
before Sasquatch calls the cops.

44:04.343 --> 44:06.971
Yeah, 'cause that's
how we do what we do. Right?

44:07.046 --> 44:08.343
That's what you get, buddy.

44:08.414 --> 44:12.145
Oh! Oh! Oh!
Let's go! Yeah!

44:12.218 --> 44:14.516
Pull me in. Let's get
out of here. Pull me in!

44:14.587 --> 44:17.249
Big people stink!

44:18.457 --> 44:21.153
OK, well, you don't see that every day.

44:21.227 --> 44:26.995
Indeed. And on that strange note,
I bid you good night.

44:27.066 --> 44:29.728
Yes, yes.

44:29.802 --> 44:33.602
Oh! Oh!

44:33.672 --> 44:36.539
All right, so that's how I'm getting it.

44:36.609 --> 44:39.669
- Getting what?
- This is just... I shouldn't.

44:39.745 --> 44:42.373
I, I couldn't. You know what?
I can. I'm gonna take it.

44:42.448 --> 44:44.348
What are you talking about?

44:44.416 --> 44:46.850
I'm talking about a very generous girl

44:46.919 --> 44:50.719
who wants to give her rescuer
a cherry red Ferrari...

44:50.789 --> 44:52.814
...for free!

44:53.792 --> 44:55.316
This is sick!

44:55.394 --> 44:59.160
Well, uh, good luck with that.
I'm just going to go.

44:59.231 --> 45:00.323
What do you mean?

45:00.399 --> 45:02.367
Do you have another one at your house?

45:02.434 --> 45:04.868
Am I, am I supposed
to follow you or something?

45:04.937 --> 45:07.030
So seriously, no, no Ferrari?

45:10.709 --> 45:13.041
Where's the $100 million, at least?!

45:13.913 --> 45:15.107
Boo!

45:17.950 --> 45:20.214
<i> Hey, hey, hey!</i>
<i>Get your own campaign vehicle.</i>

45:20.286 --> 45:22.049
Yeah.

45:22.121 --> 45:24.851
- Hi.
- Hey, Aunt Jill.

45:24.924 --> 45:26.949
Hey, guys.
How did last night go?

45:27.026 --> 45:30.427
An angry dwarf kicked me in the leg,
and I didn't get a free Ferrari.

45:30.496 --> 45:31.554
So there you go.

45:31.630 --> 45:33.791
Oh. How sad.

45:33.866 --> 45:37.199
- He's talking about our bedtime story.
- Oh.

45:37.269 --> 45:40.500
Uncle Skeeter said Jeremiah would get
a new horse and a kiss,

45:40.572 --> 45:42.472
but I said the dwarf would kick him.

45:44.510 --> 45:46.239
You said it.

45:46.312 --> 45:48.280
Maybe that's how it works.

45:48.347 --> 45:49.939
The kids control the stories.

45:51.550 --> 45:54.485
And there are the wind chimes.
You know what that means.

45:54.553 --> 45:55.713
What what means?

45:55.788 --> 45:57.983
Huh?

45:58.057 --> 46:00.218
Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

46:00.292 --> 46:01.350
I won't.

46:02.895 --> 46:06.558
OK, guys. Um, what is Bugsy doing?

46:09.568 --> 46:13.402
Working off the hamburgers
he ate last night.

46:13.472 --> 46:16.270
Yes, I gave Bugsy some hamburgers,

46:16.342 --> 46:19.903
but I gave the children
that wheat germ stuff

46:19.979 --> 46:21.640
because that's what they love.

46:21.714 --> 46:25.013
I guess it's, uh, Bugsy
watching the TV then too?

46:25.084 --> 46:27.678
Yeah, I flipped that on
and, look, he's glued to it.

46:31.523 --> 46:33.081
I'm innocent!

46:34.526 --> 46:35.959
What was that?

46:36.028 --> 46:39.259
Uh... that was the sleep
panic disorder, I believe.

46:39.331 --> 46:42.300
Why don't we, uh, get out of
here before the next attack.

46:42.368 --> 46:44.359
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Give your uncle a kiss.

46:44.436 --> 46:46.768
I'm a relative, I deserve it.
Right there.

46:46.839 --> 46:48.534
Oh, that felt nice.

46:48.607 --> 46:50.541
How about one more for the road?

46:50.609 --> 46:54.272
- No.
- Come on, baby!

46:54.346 --> 46:57.008
Don't worry, we'll be back tonight.

46:57.082 --> 46:58.515
Yeah, no, I'm not worried.

46:58.584 --> 47:00.984
You're coming back,
we got a big story tonight!

47:01.053 --> 47:04.750
About some hotel theme ideas!
Yeah!

47:04.823 --> 47:07.519
- Maybe we won't come back.
- What?

47:07.593 --> 47:10.153
- Skeeter?
- Sir Butt-Kiss. Sir... Kendall.

47:10.229 --> 47:14.962
I understand that you feel a need
to prepare for our little... showdown.

47:15.034 --> 47:16.865
- Yeah.
- That does not excuse you

47:16.935 --> 47:18.698
from maintenance responsibilities.

47:18.771 --> 47:20.705
- Oh, no. Check.
- Lights are out in the spa.

47:20.773 --> 47:23.207
- The south service elevator is slow.
- Check.

47:23.275 --> 47:24.833
Let me try that cheesecake.

47:26.145 --> 47:28.579
Oh, another thing.

47:28.647 --> 47:32.879
I heard about your big hero act
with my girlfriend last night.

47:32.951 --> 47:35.920
- This paparazzi was...
- I know what it is you're trying to do,

47:35.988 --> 47:37.751
and it's not gonna work.

47:37.823 --> 47:39.381
You have to find another way

47:39.458 --> 47:42.222
to cozy up to the old man
because I'm here to tell you

47:42.294 --> 47:46.526
Violet Nottingham is not gonna
date a gum-scraping handyman.

47:49.334 --> 47:50.392
Hey, Kendall.

47:52.004 --> 47:55.838
Two things. First off,
you got something right there.

47:55.908 --> 48:00.004
Yeah, now, use your hands.
That's disturbing to see.

48:00.079 --> 48:03.515
Good. Secondly, when I get
the job at the new hotel,

48:03.582 --> 48:07.746
I was actually considering keeping
you on, so watch your tone with me.

48:09.088 --> 48:12.785
Your brief little trip
to the land of make-believe

48:12.858 --> 48:15.053
is just about over, my friend. OK?

48:15.127 --> 48:18.426
We all know your failed father
ran this hotel into the ground,

48:18.497 --> 48:21.159
and thankfully, you will not
get the chance to make

48:21.233 --> 48:23.030
the same mistake all over again.

48:25.204 --> 48:26.569
May want to pick that up.

48:33.846 --> 48:35.711
- It's Duncan.
- <i> Lover, hello.</i>

48:35.781 --> 48:37.271
I'm looking for the hotel site.

48:37.349 --> 48:39.476
<i>I gave you the address,</i>
<i>macho bunny.</i>

48:39.551 --> 48:42.281
The address you gave me is no good.
There's a school here.

48:42.354 --> 48:45.221
- <i>Oh, what school?</i>
- Webster Elementary School.

48:45.290 --> 48:48.054
- <i>Oh, then you're in the right place.</i>
- Is that so?

48:48.127 --> 48:50.857
- <i>This school is being shut down.</i>
- Uh-huh.

48:50.929 --> 48:53.864
<i>The old man pulled a few strings</i>
<i>at the board of education.</i>

48:53.932 --> 48:56.457
- Really?
- <i>We start demolition immediately.</i>

48:56.535 --> 48:58.662
That is very exciting news.

48:58.737 --> 49:00.967
<i>Oh, Pinky.</i>

49:06.011 --> 49:08.479
<i> Hello!</i>

49:08.547 --> 49:10.481
Skeeter? Hey, it's Wendy.

49:10.549 --> 49:13.746
- <i>Hey, sissy.</i>
- Hey. How's it going?

49:13.819 --> 49:16.447
- Are the kids OK?
- <i>Oh, yeah. We're having a blast.</i>

49:16.522 --> 49:17.989
<i>That was impressive, Bobbi,</i>

49:18.056 --> 49:21.150
<i>but Uncle Skeeter can jump</i>
<i>over the couch the long way.</i>

49:21.226 --> 49:24.559
- Skeeter, can I talk to them?
- <i>No, I'm taking them camping.</i>

49:24.630 --> 49:26.359
- No.
- <i>Have fun in Arizona. Bye!</i>

49:26.431 --> 49:29.366
Camping? No, Skeeter,
they could get poison ivy!

49:29.434 --> 49:32.267
- Let's go. Quietly.
- Where are we going?

49:32.337 --> 49:34.305
- Someplace special, fools.
- Whoo-hoo!

49:34.373 --> 49:38.104
Now march, march,
march, march...

49:38.177 --> 49:39.974
<i># I don't know</i>
<i>but it's been said</i>

49:40.045 --> 49:41.637
<i># Bugsy's eyes</i>
<i>pop out of his head</i>

49:41.713 --> 49:43.943
March, march, march...

49:44.016 --> 49:46.143
- Whoo-hoo!
- March, let's go.

49:48.253 --> 49:49.481
Whoa! Cool!

49:49.555 --> 49:51.853
We're going to have ourselves
a camp-out.

49:51.924 --> 49:54.984
You guys, look what he's done!
Isn't this cool?

49:55.060 --> 49:57.460
- See? See how nice I am?
- Yeah.

49:57.529 --> 49:59.588
Whoa, OK, just be careful
around the fire.

49:59.665 --> 50:03.260
Hey, Jill. Shh.
Don't want everyone to hear we're here.

50:05.504 --> 50:09.668
I heard about marshmallows.
Saw them in magazines.

50:09.741 --> 50:12.676
I never imagined they
would be this good.

50:12.744 --> 50:15.838
Let's just hope your mother
doesn't find out I gave you any.

50:15.914 --> 50:18.576
- I won't tell her.
- I'm not talking about you.

50:18.650 --> 50:19.912
She's the weak link.

50:19.985 --> 50:22.419
I think I can let this one slide.

50:22.487 --> 50:25.547
Ahh! The mermaid's being cool.
Look at that.

50:25.624 --> 50:27.489
- The what?
- The nothing.

50:30.128 --> 50:33.427
You know, when we were younger
and your mom and I were out on the roof,

50:33.498 --> 50:35.830
my dad would always tell us
to look at the stars

50:35.901 --> 50:40.065
and see if you could make something
out of them. All right, like, uh...

50:40.138 --> 50:42.698
Right over there.
Right over there. Look, look.

50:42.774 --> 50:44.401
To me, that looks like a camel.

50:44.476 --> 50:46.569
You see the humps? Huh?
The tongue hanging out?

50:46.645 --> 50:48.010
Oh, yeah. I see that.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.105
Hey, look over there!
It's a pyramid.

50:50.182 --> 50:52.548
Yeah!
Hey, good one, Patrick.

50:52.618 --> 50:55.519
Look, right next to the moon.
Right, right beside it.

50:55.587 --> 50:57.612
It looks exactly like Bugsy.

50:57.689 --> 51:00.089
Oh, my God!

51:00.158 --> 51:03.093
Don't worry, Bugsy.
Your eyes are still bigger.

51:06.999 --> 51:09.126
Uncle Skeeter?

51:09.201 --> 51:10.600
Yes, good-looking.

51:11.770 --> 51:14.136
Do you think my father will come back?

51:17.342 --> 51:21.073
Um...
Well, that's a tough one.

51:23.982 --> 51:28.282
He must be going through some...
mental malfunction

51:28.353 --> 51:33.120
to not want to be with you two guys
every second of the day.

51:33.191 --> 51:37.821
But, uh, I do know this.

51:37.896 --> 51:40.524
You're always going to have your mother.

51:40.599 --> 51:43.864
You're always gonna have
this girl to hang out with.

51:43.935 --> 51:47.336
And me, I ain't ever going anywhere.

51:48.674 --> 51:50.164
OK?

51:50.242 --> 51:54.178
I'm like the stink on your feet.
I'll always be around.

51:59.484 --> 52:02.578
OK. You guys made me late.
I hope you're happy.

52:02.654 --> 52:05.452
Well, thank you.
Have fun at night school.

52:06.825 --> 52:08.622
See you tomorrow.

52:08.694 --> 52:11.060
All right, we got rid of her,
so let's get to business.

52:11.129 --> 52:12.994
Put the s'mores down.
Story time.

52:13.065 --> 52:17.932
All right, guys. Tonight's story's
gonna be extra special.

52:18.003 --> 52:19.800
It's called...

52:19.871 --> 52:24.774
<i>... The Great Hotel Idea Story.</i>

52:24.843 --> 52:25.935
Yeah!

52:26.011 --> 52:28.206
- What?
- Boring.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.180
Come on, guys,
I really need you to do this.

52:30.248 --> 52:32.011
It's gonna help
my life a lot. Please?

52:33.251 --> 52:34.582
All right, you know what?

52:34.653 --> 52:36.951
We still got one more night.
Let's have a fun story.

52:37.022 --> 52:39.388
How about some Evel Knievel stuff?

52:39.458 --> 52:42.859
Racing, jumping, flying...

52:42.928 --> 52:45.328
Or maybe something like romantic?

52:47.299 --> 52:48.857
I have a good idea.

52:48.934 --> 52:52.062
Let's combine the action
and the romance

52:52.137 --> 52:54.799
and make a romaction story.

52:54.873 --> 52:57.000
- Yeah.
- Let us begin.

52:57.075 --> 53:00.511
The greatest of all the heroes
in ancient Greece

53:00.579 --> 53:03.047
was, of course, Skeetacus.

53:04.549 --> 53:06.517
<i>He was truly amazing</i>

53:06.585 --> 53:11.579
<i>yet totally underrated</i>
<i>and had been ignored for years.</i>

53:11.656 --> 53:16.923
<i>Finally Skeetacus had his chance</i>
<i>to show his skills in the grand arena.</i>

53:18.697 --> 53:21.393
<i>If he could impress the</i>
<i>daughter of the emperor,</i>

53:21.466 --> 53:24.594
<i>he knew he would one day rule the land.</i>

53:27.606 --> 53:30.166
- <i>Skeetacus, Skeetacus!</i>
- Go on, Skeetacus!

53:30.242 --> 53:33.177
That's pretty fancy chariot work.

53:33.245 --> 53:34.678
For a peasant.

53:34.746 --> 53:37.510
<i># I see London, I see France</i>

53:37.582 --> 53:39.914
<i># I see my golden underpants</i>

53:39.985 --> 53:41.714
Whoo!

53:51.029 --> 53:53.224
Oh, wh... what is he doing?

53:54.433 --> 53:55.491
Whoa!

54:00.305 --> 54:01.738
Bring on the elephants!

54:05.143 --> 54:06.610
- Whoa.
- Ooh.

54:08.013 --> 54:09.537
All right.

54:09.614 --> 54:11.309
<i> You know how Hercules</i>

54:11.383 --> 54:13.351
<i>supposedly founded the Olympics?</i>

54:18.123 --> 54:22.150
<i>Well, Skeetacus invented the X Games.</i>

54:22.227 --> 54:23.751
He's never gonna make it!

54:37.142 --> 54:38.507
Now that's first class.

54:40.045 --> 54:41.137
Hey!

54:41.213 --> 54:43.078
- Bravo!
- Wow.

54:44.983 --> 54:47.850
Can you dig it?

54:47.919 --> 54:50.114
Skeetacus!

54:50.188 --> 54:52.019
How we doing so far, huh?

54:52.090 --> 54:56.117
- This is the best story yet.
- Can we get to the romance now?

54:56.194 --> 54:57.991
<i> Well, shorty, you tell me?</i>

54:58.063 --> 55:00.588
<i>Does Skeetacus get</i>
<i>the girl he was after?</i>

55:00.665 --> 55:02.132
<i> In these stories,</i>

55:02.200 --> 55:04.691
<i>the hero always gets the fairest</i>
<i>maiden in the land.</i>

55:04.769 --> 55:07.260
Yes! You said it!
OK, so it's gonna happen!

55:07.339 --> 55:10.399
Uh, right. So, what? They're thirsty?
They go off for drinks?

55:10.475 --> 55:12.943
A little wine and cheese action? Yes?

55:13.011 --> 55:18.005
<i> Yeah, they can go to an old</i>
<i>tavern. And guess who's there?</i>

55:18.083 --> 55:20.017
Led Zeppelin.
Say Led Zeppelin, please.

55:20.085 --> 55:23.987
No. All the girls that were mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

55:24.055 --> 55:26.353
What? Nobody was mean
to Skeetacus growing up.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.255
He was like
the coolest guy in school.

55:28.326 --> 55:30.294
That's not what Mom said.

55:30.362 --> 55:32.353
All right, everybody was
mean to Skeetacus.

55:32.430 --> 55:35.194
He had problems.
All right, tell your story.

55:35.267 --> 55:36.564
Oh, my God...

55:36.635 --> 55:37.966
<i> They see he's now with</i>

55:38.036 --> 55:39.799
<i>the fairest maiden in all the land,</i>

55:39.871 --> 55:43.238
<i>and they are really jealous.</i>

55:43.308 --> 55:45.469
<i> So jealous they</i>
<i>don't know what to do.</i>

55:45.544 --> 55:48.377
They just start nervously
doing the hokey-pokey.

55:48.446 --> 55:50.277
<i> # Put your right hand in</i>

55:50.348 --> 55:52.145
<i># You put your right hand out</i>

55:52.217 --> 55:53.912
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

55:53.985 --> 55:55.919
<i># And you shake it all about</i>

55:57.289 --> 55:58.847
OK.

55:58.924 --> 56:00.949
<i> So then,</i>

56:01.026 --> 56:03.688
<i>Skeetacus takes his date</i>
<i>out to the beach.</i>

56:03.762 --> 56:06.959
<i> All of a sudden,</i>
<i>a big hairy guy</i>

56:07.032 --> 56:10.331
<i>washes up onshore, passed out.</i>

56:10.402 --> 56:12.267
<i> Why a hairy guy?</i>
<i>I don't get it.</i>

56:12.337 --> 56:13.429
<i> Just 'cause.</i>

56:13.505 --> 56:16.702
<i>He had something stuck in his throat,</i>
<i>and he wasn't breathing.</i>

56:20.312 --> 56:23.907
- Thanks.
- He's OK.

56:23.982 --> 56:27.179
And then it starts pouring,
so they run into a magical cave.

56:27.252 --> 56:30.221
- Caves are nice.
- And Abe Lincoln's there.

56:30.288 --> 56:32.620
Abe Lincoln?
What, is this a joke to you?

56:32.691 --> 56:35.558
What the heck's the matter with you?
Oh, I'm sorry.

56:35.627 --> 56:36.821
I, I didn't mean to yell.

56:36.895 --> 56:39.386
The Abe Lincoln thing, that's,
that's a good idea.

56:39.464 --> 56:43.423
It's just that, uh...
Does Skeetacus get a kiss?

56:43.501 --> 56:46.902
Don't you think he should?
It's... been a long time for him.

56:46.972 --> 56:52.069
His lips are very dry
from not using them.

56:52.143 --> 56:53.770
Bugsy, you with me?

56:56.815 --> 56:58.407
We'll see.

56:58.483 --> 57:01.043
- <i> Hello?</i>
- Mmm.

57:01.119 --> 57:03.747
Hey, is this the fairest maiden
in the land?

57:03.822 --> 57:05.847
Mr. Skeeter Bronson, is that you?

57:05.924 --> 57:09.223
<i>Yes, it is. Sorry about that Ferrari</i>
<i>confusion the other night.</i>

57:09.294 --> 57:12.730
I'm here at the beach right now
and I had a hunch you might be here too.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.560
What do you say
we get a little lunchsky?

57:14.633 --> 57:16.123
<i>That sounds so delightful.</i>

57:16.201 --> 57:19.227
But I can't. I'm afraid I'm
on my way to Vegas for the day.

57:20.438 --> 57:21.666
Vegas?

57:21.740 --> 57:24.106
Uh, no one talked about Vegas.

57:24.175 --> 57:26.439
Don't tell Kendall.
He thinks I'm in the library.

57:26.511 --> 57:28.843
Yeah, no. But, but, uh, princess,

57:28.913 --> 57:31.108
I, I really thought we
were gonna hang out today.

57:31.182 --> 57:33.912
Oh, well. I will see you
at Daddy's birthday party.

57:33.985 --> 57:34.974
<i>Bye, Skeeter.</i>

57:36.187 --> 57:37.916
Hmm.

57:37.989 --> 57:41.015
So our date's gonna be tomorrow?
I can live with that.

57:41.092 --> 57:44.118
Hey! Look out! Look out!

57:44.195 --> 57:48.564
Sorry. Are you OK? Hey! I'm so sorry!

57:48.633 --> 57:51.864
What is it about the cushion
of protection you don't like?

57:51.936 --> 57:54.461
Aren't you supposed to be in school?

57:54.539 --> 57:56.404
I'm supposed to be
looking for a job now,

57:56.474 --> 57:59.637
but for some reason I felt like
coming to the beach today.

57:59.711 --> 58:00.939
Huh.

58:01.012 --> 58:02.479
Um, are you hungry?

58:02.547 --> 58:05.539
Yes, I'm always hungry
when I'm in pain.

58:05.617 --> 58:07.710
Good. Because I'm buying.

58:07.786 --> 58:10.550
I'll let you buy me lunch.
Somebody stole my wallet,

58:10.622 --> 58:13.819
- so how was I gonna pay?
- Of course you got your wallet stolen.

58:13.892 --> 58:17.225
- I don't know what that means.
- You. It's always something with you.

58:17.295 --> 58:19.126
- Huh?
- You're wearing my hat.

58:19.197 --> 58:21.722
- Gonna wear that all day?
- I'm not wearing nobody's hat.

58:21.800 --> 58:24.496
- I'm wearing your hat! Oh!
- I'll take it back. Thanks.

58:30.909 --> 58:32.706
This is perfect for your free lunch.

58:32.777 --> 58:35.837
Oh, my gosh. You guys,
you guys, you guys. Over there.

58:35.914 --> 58:37.848
Is that...
is that Skeeter Bronson?

58:37.916 --> 58:39.383
- Stop it.
- Oh, my God.

58:39.451 --> 58:41.817
- Oh, my God.
- Skeeter.

58:41.886 --> 58:44.081
Hey! Do you remember me?

58:44.155 --> 58:47.056
It's Donna Hynde from high school.

58:47.125 --> 58:48.888
Yeah, I do.

58:48.960 --> 58:52.555
Thought I was going to run into you
shortly. And here you are.

58:52.630 --> 58:55.861
Yeah. Wow, this is so...
weird. Uh...

58:55.934 --> 58:58.402
We were just planning
our high school reunion.

58:58.470 --> 59:01.735
We were totally just talking about you.
It's so weird.

59:01.806 --> 59:03.774
I was just talking about you guys too.

59:03.842 --> 59:05.332
Sure, he was.

59:05.410 --> 59:08.072
Mind pretending to be
my girlfriend for a second?

59:08.146 --> 59:10.080
Yeah, I don't feel
comfortable doing that.

59:10.148 --> 59:12.514
I'll, uh, convert my truck to biodiesel.

59:14.452 --> 59:15.942
- OK, I'll do it.
- Ding-dong.

59:16.020 --> 59:19.183
Uh, this is my girlfriend,
guys. This is Jill.

59:19.257 --> 59:20.952
Hello.

59:21.025 --> 59:22.549
She's your girlfriend?

59:22.627 --> 59:24.060
Yeah. Yeah.

59:24.129 --> 59:25.687
Yes, I am.

59:25.764 --> 59:27.095
- Right?
- Yup.

59:27.165 --> 59:29.395
She thinks I'm...

59:29.467 --> 59:32.868
You want me to...
Oh. Uh... romantic.

59:32.937 --> 59:34.802
She likes how romantic I can be.

59:34.873 --> 59:37.899
And, uh, "great kisser,"
she likes to say.

59:37.976 --> 59:41.309
Oh, yeah. That's...
a little too much.

59:41.379 --> 59:44.439
- Oh. Sorry.
- Wow, you are really pretty.

59:44.516 --> 59:46.814
- I mean, she's all right.
- Thanks.

59:46.885 --> 59:49.752
I've seen hotter,
but she's pretty cool.

59:49.821 --> 59:51.152
So super skinny.

59:51.222 --> 59:54.851
Skinnier than you.
But... Yeah.

59:56.227 --> 59:57.251
Whatever.

59:57.328 --> 59:59.956
I feel really awful
saying this out loud.

01:00:00.031 --> 01:00:04.798
We were really terrible to Skeeter
in high school. Awful. So mean.

01:00:04.869 --> 01:00:06.302
My Skeeter?

01:00:06.371 --> 01:00:08.771
- They were.
- You had a hard time in high school?

01:00:08.840 --> 01:00:12.503
Look at you now.
You turned out pretty... cute.

01:00:12.577 --> 01:00:14.135
- Yeah!
- You know...

01:00:14.212 --> 01:00:17.340
the pimples went away,
and, uh, these came to play.

01:00:19.984 --> 01:00:21.849
- You want to touch them?
- Oh, that's OK.

01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:25.048
- Later, later.
- They're here for you. Ding-dong.

01:00:26.324 --> 01:00:27.985
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

01:00:28.059 --> 01:00:30.459
<i> # You put your right hand out</i>

01:00:30.528 --> 01:00:32.120
<i># You put your right hand in</i>

01:00:32.197 --> 01:00:34.062
- <i># And you shake it all about</i>
- OK.

01:00:34.132 --> 01:00:36.157
- I think we should leave.
- Yes.

01:00:36.234 --> 01:00:38.099
<i># And you turn yourself around</i>

01:00:38.169 --> 01:00:40.603
- All right. Bye-bye.
- <i># That's what it's all about #</i>

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:41.934
What's happening?

01:00:42.006 --> 01:00:44.304
Hey, so I spoke to Wendy.

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:46.275
She's excited to see the kids tomorrow.

01:00:46.344 --> 01:00:48.369
This is the longest
she's been away from them.

01:00:48.446 --> 01:00:53.042
That's right.
This is my last night with the kids.

01:00:53.117 --> 01:00:54.914
You know,
they're gonna be devastated.

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:56.647
They worship you

01:00:56.721 --> 01:00:59.485
and those amazing bedtime stories
you've been telling them.

01:00:59.557 --> 01:01:02.321
Oh, well, they say all the good parts.
I promise.

01:01:02.393 --> 01:01:04.486
Oh, my gosh.
Is he unconscious?

01:01:04.562 --> 01:01:05.654
Yeah, yeah.

01:01:08.132 --> 01:01:10.566
Boom! Oh.

01:01:12.103 --> 01:01:13.400
Thanks!

01:01:14.472 --> 01:01:15.632
Whoa!

01:01:15.707 --> 01:01:17.572
- Yeah?
- Check out Mr. Smooth.

01:01:17.642 --> 01:01:21.237
Well, you know, I do what I do.

01:01:21.312 --> 01:01:23.872
- Think we should get out of this rain?
- What rain?

01:01:26.551 --> 01:01:28.280
Oh, shoot!
Where did that come from?

01:01:28.353 --> 01:01:30.150
I don't know!
Isn't it amazing?

01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:33.349
- Let's get out of this!
- Let's go! Let's get out! Move it!

01:01:35.326 --> 01:01:37.590
I can read the future.

01:01:39.797 --> 01:01:42.925
Good God. So...

01:01:43.001 --> 01:01:47.267
So... The big presentation's
tomorrow, right?

01:01:47.338 --> 01:01:50.000
I know you're not nervous
or anything, but, um...

01:01:50.074 --> 01:01:51.405
good luck on it anyway.

01:01:51.476 --> 01:01:52.841
- Thank you.
- Yep.

01:01:52.911 --> 01:01:57.245
Actually, you can come
if you want. It's like a party.

01:01:57.315 --> 01:02:00.045
You know, Wendy's gonna be
watching the kids,

01:02:00.118 --> 01:02:01.415
and we could have fun.

01:02:01.486 --> 01:02:03.113
You can meet me there.

01:02:04.155 --> 01:02:06.248
Yeah. That would, uh...

01:02:06.324 --> 01:02:09.987
I could do that.
I could meet you, um...

01:02:10.061 --> 01:02:12.689
...after night school or something.

01:02:14.599 --> 01:02:16.692
It's you?

01:02:16.768 --> 01:02:18.929
It's me what?

01:02:20.538 --> 01:02:23.439
You're the fairest maiden in the land?

01:02:25.476 --> 01:02:28.673
"Fair" as in
"doesn't cheat at checkers"?

01:02:30.715 --> 01:02:33.183
No, fairest as in...

01:02:34.786 --> 01:02:36.811
..."beautifulest."

01:02:46.798 --> 01:02:49.665
Wait, wait.
Something weird's gonna happen.

01:02:50.735 --> 01:02:52.600
Oh.

01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:55.764
No, yeah, we don't...
This is a mistake.

01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:59.776
No, no, no, not between us.
I mean like, some...

01:02:59.844 --> 01:03:02.711
No! No, no!
Oh, here comes Abe!

01:03:03.548 --> 01:03:05.311
No!

01:03:14.192 --> 01:03:15.784
Ah! Look.

01:03:16.761 --> 01:03:19.286
- Wow, a penny.
- No, no, no.

01:03:19.364 --> 01:03:22.458
This is the weird thing
I was talking about. Abe Lincoln.

01:03:22.533 --> 01:03:25.434
- Yeah. Yeah.
- No, no, no, no.

01:03:25.503 --> 01:03:28.438
Abe's not gonna interrupt
this time. That was it.

01:03:28.506 --> 01:03:30.235
It's supposed to end better than this.

01:03:30.308 --> 01:03:33.368
Stick around. I'm tellin' ya,
you're gonna be missing out.

01:03:35.013 --> 01:03:37.140
Nice imagination, Patrick.

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:46.718
- Skeeter?
- Yo.

01:03:46.791 --> 01:03:49.521
We've got a little bit
of a shaving situation in there.

01:03:49.594 --> 01:03:51.926
Oh, no, no, no.
I took the razor blades out.

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.827
Don't worry. Their father ain't around,

01:03:53.898 --> 01:03:56.059
I figured someone has to
teach them how to shave.

01:03:57.702 --> 01:04:00.136
I'm Princess Leia.

01:04:00.204 --> 01:04:01.899
Uh-huh.

01:04:03.674 --> 01:04:06.234
So, are you ready
for the big showdown tomorrow night?

01:04:06.310 --> 01:04:07.299
Oh, yeah.

01:04:07.378 --> 01:04:08.675
What I'm going to do is

01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:10.680
tell them a bedtime story tonight.

01:04:10.748 --> 01:04:13.546
I'll have me win in the story.

01:04:13.618 --> 01:04:17.145
Then I'll win for reals.
Do you dig?

01:04:17.221 --> 01:04:18.916
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah, I understand.

01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:21.220
So it's like, um,
positive visualization.

01:04:21.292 --> 01:04:23.021
I read a book on that once.

01:04:23.995 --> 01:04:26.293
Read the back cover, at least.

01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.697
I can't read.

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:34.466
Shut up, Bugsy!

01:04:34.539 --> 01:04:37.167
I've got opposable thumbs.
How do you feel about that?

01:04:39.277 --> 01:04:40.835
You children ready?

01:04:40.912 --> 01:04:43.642
Because here comes our last story.

01:04:44.816 --> 01:04:47.512
The fate of the entire universe

01:04:47.585 --> 01:04:49.416
hung in the balance,

01:04:49.487 --> 01:04:51.751
as the Supreme Galactic Council

01:04:51.823 --> 01:04:54.257
<i>met to determine who would control</i>

01:04:54.325 --> 01:04:59.524
<i>the new planet in the vast</i>
<i>Nottinghamian star system.</i>

01:05:01.332 --> 01:05:05.234
<i>Most in attendance expected</i>
<i>Supreme Leader Barracto</i>

01:05:05.303 --> 01:05:08.500
<i>to rule in favor of General Kendallo,</i>

01:05:08.573 --> 01:05:11.406
<i>the evil governor of Hotelium.</i>

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.672
<i>But there was a wild card in the mix...</i>

01:05:16.814 --> 01:05:19.442
<i>... Skeeto Bronsonnian</i>

01:05:19.517 --> 01:05:22.543
<i>and his sidekick,</i>
<i>Mickey Doo Quicky Doo.</i>

01:05:24.188 --> 01:05:26.088
<i>They all watched with excitement.</i>

01:05:26.157 --> 01:05:28.717
<i>Lieutenant Jilli</i>
<i>and her two young cadets,</i>

01:05:28.793 --> 01:05:32.820
<i>Aspenoff, and even</i>
<i>the great Captain Bugzoid.</i>

01:05:32.897 --> 01:05:37.425
<i> Hey, since it's outer space,</i>
<i>Skeeto should talk like a goofy alien.</i>

01:05:37.502 --> 01:05:40.665
<i> What?</i>

01:05:42.907 --> 01:05:45.808
That's disgusting.
I'm not going to translate that.

01:05:45.877 --> 01:05:47.105
Silence!

01:05:47.178 --> 01:05:48.577
The leader of the new planet

01:05:48.646 --> 01:05:51.843
shall be determined
the old-fashioned way:

01:05:51.916 --> 01:05:55.147
A zero-gravity fight.

01:06:06.898 --> 01:06:10.197
<i> OK, now we get to the part</i>
<i>the crowd came to see.</i>

01:06:10.268 --> 01:06:13.362
<i>Skeeto defeating Kendallo, right?</i>

01:06:15.339 --> 01:06:17.933
<i> I think we need</i>
<i>to see them battle first.</i>

01:06:30.321 --> 01:06:32.516
<i> Kendallo makes the first move.</i>

01:06:43.601 --> 01:06:45.501
- Skeeto!
- <i> But the kids</i>

01:06:45.570 --> 01:06:47.765
<i>really want to see Skeeto</i>
<i>kick his butt, right?</i>

01:06:56.948 --> 01:06:58.677
Wet willy.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:01.274
Boring!

01:07:01.352 --> 01:07:04.014
Uh, bring out the booger monster!

01:07:08.326 --> 01:07:10.487
<i> Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.</i>

01:07:20.271 --> 01:07:23.866
<i> All right, have the booger</i>
<i>monster smack Kendallo around.</i>

01:07:23.941 --> 01:07:26.341
<i> No, I think he should kiss him.</i>

01:07:29.213 --> 01:07:31.545
<i> Would you get</i>
<i>to Skeeto winning already?</i>

01:07:31.616 --> 01:07:33.550
<i> OK.</i>

01:07:36.687 --> 01:07:38.450
Whoa!

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.364
Arise, Skeeto,
sharif of Nottinghamia.

01:07:57.708 --> 01:07:59.175
- Whoopee!
- Whoo!

01:08:01.679 --> 01:08:04.307
And that is the perfect ending

01:08:04.382 --> 01:08:06.247
to our last story.

01:08:06.317 --> 01:08:07.784
Thank you, children.

01:08:07.852 --> 01:08:09.444
Oh, that's not the ending.

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.420
Yeah. That would be too obvious.

01:08:11.489 --> 01:08:12.478
What do you mean?

01:08:12.556 --> 01:08:14.148
Somebody threw a fireball at Skeeto

01:08:14.225 --> 01:08:16.386
and Skeeto got incineratated.

01:08:18.362 --> 01:08:20.921
- The end.
- "Incineratated"?

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:24.296
<i> You mean "incinerated"?</i>

01:08:24.368 --> 01:08:27.496
No! No, no!
He can't catch on fire.

01:08:27.571 --> 01:08:30.165
Yeah. I'm Captain Skeeto.
I'm on fire!

01:08:30.241 --> 01:08:32.675
No, no, no.
The story can't end like that.

01:08:32.743 --> 01:08:34.573
What happened to a nice, happy ending?

01:08:34.645 --> 01:08:37.773
You said happy endings
don't really happen.

01:08:37.848 --> 01:08:39.337
We want our story to be real.

01:08:39.417 --> 01:08:41.647
Oh, I was just saying that.
I was stupid.

01:08:41.719 --> 01:08:43.277
No, no, no, no, no.

01:08:43.354 --> 01:08:45.845
So, what? We're really going
to have me on fire? Hey!

01:08:45.923 --> 01:08:49.051
Don't fall asleep, or the story
will lock. Stop it! Wake up!

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.526
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

01:08:51.662 --> 01:08:55.063
I can't believe
Skeeter didn't tell you.

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:58.124
And I'm sure it's just a
coincidence that the new hotel

01:08:58.202 --> 01:09:02.069
is going up right here
where the, where the school is.

01:09:02.139 --> 01:09:04.038
Well, I'm pretty sure...

01:09:04.108 --> 01:09:05.096
Excuse me. Yeah.

01:09:05.176 --> 01:09:07.303
<i> Everything's ready</i>
<i>for the presentation.</i>

01:09:07.377 --> 01:09:08.845
- Good.
- <i>Ten-four, rubber duck.</i>

01:09:08.912 --> 01:09:10.505
Got it. Great.

01:09:13.951 --> 01:09:14.975
<i># Oh, uh</i>

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.680
<i># Fire</i>

01:09:21.292 --> 01:09:23.760
<i># Oh, oh, oh</i>
<i>I'm on fire</i>

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.460
<i># Is this burning</i>

01:09:27.531 --> 01:09:28.759
<i># An et...</i>

01:09:30.234 --> 01:09:32.259
<i># Burn, baby, burn</i>

01:09:34.071 --> 01:09:37.973
OK. The good news is,
you're going to win the competition.

01:09:38.042 --> 01:09:40.977
The bad news is,
you're probably gonna catch on fire,

01:09:41.045 --> 01:09:44.139
but not if you take a few precautions.

01:09:45.049 --> 01:09:47.243
Oven mitts, smoke alarm.

01:09:50.821 --> 01:09:51.810
Yeah.

01:09:52.990 --> 01:09:56.619
"Flame-resistant
Christmas tree spray." Yeah.

01:09:58.162 --> 01:10:00.528
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
this will work.

01:10:01.298 --> 01:10:02.356
Excuse me. Sir?

01:10:02.433 --> 01:10:04.264
Those are actually for Christmas trees.

01:10:04.335 --> 01:10:05.393
I know. 'Tis the season.

01:10:05.469 --> 01:10:07.664
- Ow! God!
- I'm so sorry.

01:10:07.738 --> 01:10:09.205
It burns!

01:10:09.273 --> 01:10:10.570
Here, let me make it up to you.

01:10:10.641 --> 01:10:12.438
- Ow!
- It's for trees!

01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:13.909
It's for trees!

01:10:13.978 --> 01:10:15.639
You're right! That hurts!

01:10:16.981 --> 01:10:18.915
I'm sorry about that!

01:10:27.792 --> 01:10:30.454
Antibacterial wipes, anybody?

01:10:30.528 --> 01:10:32.689
Aloha. Aloha.

01:10:32.763 --> 01:10:34.196
Thank you so much.

01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:37.997
Whoa!

01:10:39.103 --> 01:10:42.095
Steady. Steady.

01:10:47.445 --> 01:10:49.913
- Kona coffee ice cream.
- Yeah? What's the catch?

01:10:49.980 --> 01:10:52.608
You're gonna light it on fire?
'Cause I'm on to you, honey.

01:10:52.683 --> 01:10:54.742
No fire. It would melt.

01:10:54.819 --> 01:10:57.413
Just take the ice cream
and a chill pill.

01:11:07.164 --> 01:11:09.655
- Ah!
- Boo!

01:11:09.733 --> 01:11:12.167
- Skeeter.
- Yes.

01:11:12.236 --> 01:11:14.295
- That wasn't very nice.
- What wasn't?

01:11:14.371 --> 01:11:16.839
- You pushed that man in the pool.
- No, he jumped in.

01:11:16.907 --> 01:11:18.033
Hey, you see Jill around?

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:20.975
No, I ain't, I ain't
seen Jill tonight, mate.

01:11:26.016 --> 01:11:27.643
Ooh! I am cold.

01:11:27.718 --> 01:11:30.312
I'll get you a towel.

01:11:30.387 --> 01:11:32.116
- I've got your towel.
- Oh, blimey.

01:11:32.189 --> 01:11:33.850
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:11:36.660 --> 01:11:37.922
I love you.

01:11:42.266 --> 01:11:44.291
You brought me a grilled cheese
sandwich once.

01:11:44.368 --> 01:11:45.357
Yeah. I did, yes.

01:11:45.436 --> 01:11:47.336
It was Monterey Jack.
It's a good cheese.

01:11:50.841 --> 01:11:52.706
Ow!

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:54.038
Skeeter, are you all right?

01:11:54.111 --> 01:11:56.875
A bee stung my tongue!

01:11:58.849 --> 01:12:02.842
The meeting for the exciting new hotel
will take place in the living room.

01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.718
So I don't think you're going
to want to miss this.

01:12:05.789 --> 01:12:07.950
No, it's swelling up!

01:12:12.263 --> 01:12:15.562
- Can I sit there, please, mate?
- Yes, of course.

01:12:15.633 --> 01:12:18.033
- Don't touch me.
- Sorry.

01:12:18.102 --> 01:12:20.900
Before we begin,
I would just like to say,

01:12:20.971 --> 01:12:23.633
personally, happy birthday.

01:12:23.707 --> 01:12:25.231
Happy birthday.

01:12:25.309 --> 01:12:26.571
Happy birthday, Daddy.

01:12:26.644 --> 01:12:27.975
Thank you, Kendall.

01:12:28.045 --> 01:12:30.639
Yes, now, as you can see,

01:12:30.714 --> 01:12:33.012
I've invited some of the staff to sit in

01:12:33.083 --> 01:12:36.780
to see how your ideas would
play with the "regular folk."

01:12:36.854 --> 01:12:39.880
- No offense.
- None taken, Barry. None taken.

01:12:41.191 --> 01:12:42.317
So, gentlemen,

01:12:42.393 --> 01:12:44.327
which of you would like to go first?

01:12:46.864 --> 01:12:47.956
Fair enough.

01:12:49.433 --> 01:12:52.266
Mr. Nottingham,
you were absolutely right

01:12:52.336 --> 01:12:55.828
when you said the rock and roll
theme was old hat.

01:12:58.309 --> 01:13:01.039
Gone. Your insight, sir,

01:13:01.111 --> 01:13:04.171
has inspired me to,
to dig deeper,

01:13:04.248 --> 01:13:07.081
to find the commonality
at the heart

01:13:07.151 --> 01:13:08.618
of the American experience.

01:13:08.686 --> 01:13:10.620
I speak, of course...

01:13:10.688 --> 01:13:12.622
...of the musical theater.

01:13:12.690 --> 01:13:15.250
And, more specifically...

01:13:16.193 --> 01:13:17.524
...Broadway!

01:13:20.965 --> 01:13:22.432
Hit it.

01:13:22.499 --> 01:13:26.629
<i># Oh, when you first pull up</i>

01:13:26.704 --> 01:13:28.729
<i># To the grand front door</i>

01:13:28.806 --> 01:13:32.037
<i># There isn't just a bellhop</i>
<i>There's an overture</i>

01:13:32.109 --> 01:13:37.570
<i># At the Nottingham</i>
<i>Broadway Mega Resort</i>

01:13:37.648 --> 01:13:40.617
<i># Oh there's a pool</i>
<i>for the Sharks</i>

01:13:40.684 --> 01:13:42.413
<i># A pool for the Jets</i>

01:13:42.486 --> 01:13:46.149
<i># And you can bring Cats</i>
<i>'cause we take pets</i>

01:13:46.223 --> 01:13:47.918
<i># At the Nottingham Broadway</i>

01:13:47.992 --> 01:13:53.328
<i># Mega Resort #</i>

01:13:59.737 --> 01:14:03.605
Original, impressive, well done.

01:14:03.674 --> 01:14:04.902
Thank you, Kendall.

01:14:04.975 --> 01:14:06.772
Thank you, sir.

01:14:13.784 --> 01:14:15.809
Uh, sorry about that.

01:14:15.886 --> 01:14:18.855
I was, uh,
just resting my eyes.

01:14:22.493 --> 01:14:25.087
Skeeter. You're up.

01:14:41.945 --> 01:14:43.435
Are you all right, Skeeter?

01:14:45.349 --> 01:14:47.909
A bee bit my tongue.

01:14:48.619 --> 01:14:49.643
I'm sorry?

01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:53.451
A bee... stung my tongue.

01:14:57.261 --> 01:14:59.092
"A bee stung my tongue."

01:14:59.163 --> 01:15:02.155
Oh, you understand him? Oh.

01:15:02.232 --> 01:15:05.565
How did a bee sting your tongue?

01:15:05.636 --> 01:15:07.001
Uh...

01:15:07.071 --> 01:15:09.539
I was eating ice cream,
and suddenly a bee...

01:15:09.606 --> 01:15:13.064
Uh, it was on an ice cream,
and he licked it.

01:15:13.143 --> 01:15:17.170
Hmm. Can you translate
Skeeter's presentation for us?

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:19.545
- Mmm!
- Uh... Yes!

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.083
Yes, I can do that.

01:15:23.387 --> 01:15:24.979
Thank you. Ready?

01:15:25.055 --> 01:15:27.114
- I'm ready. OK.
- Ready?

01:15:34.331 --> 01:15:38.665
"I spent the last week in the hotel,
the hotel where I live..."

01:15:38.736 --> 01:15:41.034
With my niece and nephew.

01:15:41.105 --> 01:15:43.437
"With my niece and my nephew."

01:15:47.911 --> 01:15:52.871
"To a kid, everything about a
hotel is strange and wonderful."

01:15:54.451 --> 01:15:57.011
"Sleeping in a different bed."

01:15:58.722 --> 01:16:00.280
"Hanging out in the lobby."

01:16:02.493 --> 01:16:04.723
"Jumping up and down on the alligator."

01:16:09.867 --> 01:16:12.597
"Riding up and down in the elevator."

01:16:12.669 --> 01:16:13.727
Ah!

01:16:13.804 --> 01:16:15.601
Sorry. Yeah, I see now
that an alligator

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:17.299
wouldn't be in that context.

01:16:23.347 --> 01:16:27.750
"Some hotels try to make it seem
as much like home as possible."

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:31.554
"But they're missing
the point."

01:16:36.293 --> 01:16:39.956
"If you wanted to stay in a place
like home, then why not stay at home?"

01:16:44.234 --> 01:16:47.761
"Our guests should experience
an escape from the everyday."

01:16:52.676 --> 01:16:57.010
"And that's what I'd like to capture
in our new hotel."

01:17:01.552 --> 01:17:06.114
"What every kid knows
and what every adult has forgotten."

01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:15.765
"Like my father said to me,

01:17:15.833 --> 01:17:20.270
your fun is only limited
by your imagination."

01:17:23.307 --> 01:17:26.174
- That was beautiful.
- Yeah? All right. Settle down.

01:17:26.243 --> 01:17:27.676
Just the way it built.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:31.680
And that's it? I'm sorry.
I don't understand it.

01:17:33.984 --> 01:17:37.215
That... was... brilliant!

01:17:37.287 --> 01:17:40.518
Congratulations, my boy.
You've just won the keys to the kingdom.

01:17:53.370 --> 01:17:57.101
Boogie, don't do that. Germs.

01:17:59.743 --> 01:18:02.541
Congratulations. Great job.
Keep icing that tongue.

01:18:02.613 --> 01:18:05.047
- All right.
- Congratulations, Skeeter.

01:18:05.115 --> 01:18:07.049
- Congratulations. That was great.
- Yeah?

01:18:09.319 --> 01:18:10.650
That's just terrific.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:13.153
Congratulations, Skeeter.

01:18:13.223 --> 01:18:16.420
All right, Kendall.
Yeah. No hard feelings, pal.

01:18:16.493 --> 01:18:19.485
Of course not. You deserve it.
You're a better man than me.

01:18:19.563 --> 01:18:22.031
- You have an iron will.
- Yeah. That's what they say.

01:18:22.099 --> 01:18:25.591
I would not have the guts to tear down
the school my niece and nephew attend.

01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:27.637
What?

01:18:29.072 --> 01:18:31.768
You do know that's the site
for the new hotel?

01:18:31.842 --> 01:18:33.742
What are you talking about?

01:18:33.810 --> 01:18:36.040
- Good show, old son.
- Oh, sir.

01:18:36.113 --> 01:18:40.311
That bee sting language was really
working for you on a sympathetic level.

01:18:40.384 --> 01:18:43.012
Good, I'm glad. I wanted to talk to you
about the location

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:44.519
that we're building the hotel.

01:18:44.588 --> 01:18:46.749
<i> # Happy birthday to you</i>

01:18:46.823 --> 01:18:50.054
<i># Happy birthday to you</i>

01:18:50.127 --> 01:18:53.119
<i># Happy birthday</i>

01:19:14.985 --> 01:19:18.148
Bronson, you're fired!

01:19:19.523 --> 01:19:21.889
Fired?

01:19:21.959 --> 01:19:23.119
Oh...

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:25.218
That's how it connects.

01:19:36.473 --> 01:19:37.497
Yes?

01:19:37.574 --> 01:19:39.474
Do you know where
Jill Hastings' class is?

01:19:39.543 --> 01:19:40.874
It's right over there.

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:45.279
Why won't you answer my calls?

01:19:45.349 --> 01:19:47.817
Because I know it's you calling.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:50.148
You got to believe me, Jill.
I had no idea...

01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:54.680
Don't destroy the sliver of respect
I have for you by making lame excuses.

01:19:56.026 --> 01:20:00.156
Just go away and stay away.

01:20:02.232 --> 01:20:05.668
Uncle Skeeter? Do you want
to incinertate our school

01:20:05.736 --> 01:20:08.534
'cause we incinertated you in the story?

01:20:08.605 --> 01:20:10.869
No, I wouldn't do that.

01:20:10.941 --> 01:20:13.739
We thought you were
supposed to be the good guy.

01:20:27.691 --> 01:20:29.022
So did I.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:51.144
"Skeeto defeats Kendallo."

01:20:52.516 --> 01:20:54.450
Not really.

01:20:54.518 --> 01:20:58.579
- Yeah?
- Hey.

01:20:58.655 --> 01:21:01.556
Oh, hey.
Welcome back.

01:21:03.126 --> 01:21:04.855
So, you mad at me, too?

01:21:04.928 --> 01:21:08.762
Not as mad as Jill,
but, uh, mad, yes.

01:21:08.832 --> 01:21:11.460
I didn't know the new hotel
was going up there.

01:21:12.202 --> 01:21:13.362
I figured that.

01:21:13.437 --> 01:21:14.529
Then what are you mad at?

01:21:14.604 --> 01:21:16.128
I gave the kids junk food?

01:21:16.206 --> 01:21:18.401
No, I figured you'd do that too.

01:21:18.475 --> 01:21:21.603
I'm mad because you told my kids

01:21:21.678 --> 01:21:24.010
that in real life
there are no happy endings.

01:21:24.081 --> 01:21:26.015
Well, look around you, Wendy.

01:21:26.083 --> 01:21:28.210
Do you see any happy endings here?

01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:35.924
I don't know. You and Dad always had
so much fun in this room.

01:21:35.992 --> 01:21:37.653
For whatever reason, I didn't.

01:21:37.727 --> 01:21:40.787
I was always the cynic,
the, the sourpuss.

01:21:40.864 --> 01:21:43.662
The black cloud.
The energy drainer.

01:21:43.733 --> 01:21:45.860
The... dead fish.

01:21:45.936 --> 01:21:48.564
Yes, all of those things.

01:21:48.638 --> 01:21:50.663
But when I left Bobbi
and Patrick with you,

01:21:50.740 --> 01:21:53.868
I guess I just was hoping
you'd rub off on them.

01:21:53.944 --> 01:21:58.142
Get them to be lighter.
Have fun. Enjoy themselves.

01:21:59.216 --> 01:22:00.740
I thought Dad would like that.

01:22:02.252 --> 01:22:05.449
Anyway, um, I got a job in Arizona.

01:22:05.522 --> 01:22:07.752
Teaching, not principaling.

01:22:07.824 --> 01:22:09.291
That's cool.

01:22:09.359 --> 01:22:12.453
Yeah, well, maybe you can come
visit when we get settled.

01:22:12.529 --> 01:22:15.191
I know by then the kids
will really want to see you.

01:22:21.838 --> 01:22:23.305
All right. Love you.

01:22:23.373 --> 01:22:24.704
Love you.

01:22:29.479 --> 01:22:34.348
<i> And so Skeeter sat on his bed,</i>
<i>filled with regret,</i>

01:22:34.417 --> 01:22:36.783
<i>wondering how to put the pieces</i>
<i>of his life together</i>

01:22:36.853 --> 01:22:38.878
<i>after one magical week.</i>

01:22:38.955 --> 01:22:42.652
- Great ending, huh?
- <i> That was your ending, son?</i>

01:22:42.726 --> 01:22:45.957
<i>I thought this was just a sad part,</i>
<i>and you were about to make it better.</i>

01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:47.860
What? How could I make it any better?

01:22:47.931 --> 01:22:50.422
<i>Well, In the stories I told you,</i>

01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.331
<i>just when things looked bleakest,</i>

01:22:52.402 --> 01:22:55.963
<i>the hero would do something</i>
<i>unexpected and courageous</i>

01:22:56.039 --> 01:22:58.837
<i>to beat the bad guy,</i>
<i>save the day, and get the girl!</i>

01:22:59.910 --> 01:23:01.935
Yeah. How can I do that?

01:23:02.012 --> 01:23:03.604
<i>It's your story, not mine.</i>

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.807
<i>But you better get moving.</i>
<i>Go get 'em, son.</i>

01:23:16.793 --> 01:23:18.954
Mr. Nottingham! Mr. Nottingham?

01:23:19.029 --> 01:23:21.554
I was wondering if I could
talk to you for a moment.

01:23:21.631 --> 01:23:24.828
My name is Jill Hastings.
I'm a teacher at Webster Elementary.

01:23:24.901 --> 01:23:28.428
Save our school!
Save our school!

01:23:28.505 --> 01:23:31.963
Save our school!
Save our school!

01:23:32.042 --> 01:23:33.737
Save our school!

01:23:33.810 --> 01:23:35.505
Save our school!

01:23:35.579 --> 01:23:38.673
My men are in position.
We are ready for the demolition.

01:23:38.748 --> 01:23:40.909
Excellent.
Mr. Nottingham said he'd call

01:23:40.984 --> 01:23:43.077
if he had a problem
getting the variance,

01:23:43.153 --> 01:23:45.713
so if we don't hear from him
in the next 20 minutes,

01:23:45.789 --> 01:23:47.814
I say we just... blow it all up.

01:23:53.897 --> 01:23:57.424
Madam, the war is over.
You lost. I'm sorry.

01:24:01.104 --> 01:24:04.335
This isn't a war, Mr. Nottingham.
We're talking about children.

01:24:04.407 --> 01:24:07.433
There must be other possible
sites for your hotel complex

01:24:07.510 --> 01:24:10.035
that would not result
in the displacement...

01:24:10.113 --> 01:24:12.013
Hey, hey! Barry, Jill.
How you doing?

01:24:12.082 --> 01:24:14.983
We're just wrapping up here.
Donna, you remember Jill, right?

01:24:15.051 --> 01:24:19.249
Of course! Oh, my God.
That jacket is so cute!

01:24:19.322 --> 01:24:22.155
Uh, thank you.

01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:23.715
Bronson, what are you doing here?

01:24:23.793 --> 01:24:26.227
What am I doing here?
Yeah, what am I doing here?

01:24:26.296 --> 01:24:30.130
Oh, uh, well, Mr. Bronson,
as a concerned citizen,

01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:31.929
wanted to bring points to my attention

01:24:32.002 --> 01:24:34.630
before I made any hasty
decisions about the property.

01:24:34.704 --> 01:24:38.071
And they are points that are going
to take me years to analyze.

01:24:38.141 --> 01:24:40.302
- Years?
- Years.

01:24:40.377 --> 01:24:43.904
Bronson, are you
playing hardball with me?

01:24:43.980 --> 01:24:45.345
I am, sir.

01:24:45.415 --> 01:24:48.646
Because your application
for variance has been...

01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.749
Denied.

01:24:53.323 --> 01:24:54.620
Denied?

01:24:54.691 --> 01:24:56.556
Yes. But the good news is

01:24:56.626 --> 01:24:59.060
Donna and I found you
another piece of property

01:24:59.129 --> 01:25:02.997
right on the beach in Santa Monica
that is uptight and out of sight.

01:25:03.066 --> 01:25:05.626
Beachfront was my first choice,
but it's not for sale.

01:25:05.702 --> 01:25:07.169
It is now.

01:25:07.237 --> 01:25:09.467
It is! Isn't that fabulous?

01:25:09.973 --> 01:25:11.065
Really?

01:25:11.141 --> 01:25:12.574
Friends?

01:25:12.642 --> 01:25:14.633
Oh, oh.
Yeah, well, germs.

01:25:14.711 --> 01:25:18.238
Let's get past that.
Come here. Come here.

01:25:18.315 --> 01:25:21.682
No, no, no, no, no.

01:25:21.751 --> 01:25:24.584
I'm touching you,
and it's OK. Look at that.

01:25:24.654 --> 01:25:26.747
Aw...

01:25:26.823 --> 01:25:30.657
Ooh. You're enjoying it.
Good. Bring me closer.

01:25:30.727 --> 01:25:34.424
That is so sweet. And creepy.

01:25:37.567 --> 01:25:39.626
Attention, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:25:39.703 --> 01:25:44.072
We are working with highly-sensitive,
dangerous radio-controlled explosives.

01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:45.869
Boo!

01:25:45.942 --> 01:25:49.878
And so to avoid any tragic misfires,

01:25:49.946 --> 01:25:52.414
I would ask that you all
turn off your cell phones.

01:25:52.482 --> 01:25:55.713
All of you, please.
Turn your cell phones off.

01:25:57.320 --> 01:25:59.379
Did you really just fix everything?

01:25:59.456 --> 01:26:01.390
Not everything.

01:26:04.928 --> 01:26:07.123
- Yes?
- We appear to have a situation.

01:26:07.197 --> 01:26:09.165
I can't reach Kendall on his cell phone

01:26:09.232 --> 01:26:13.032
to halt the demolition
which will begin in... 13 minutes.

01:26:13.103 --> 01:26:15.003
This sign we made
is awesome!

01:26:15.071 --> 01:26:18.131
We need a window where
those construction guys can see it.

01:26:18.208 --> 01:26:20.073
Then they'll change their minds.

01:26:21.644 --> 01:26:23.305
Bobbi, I found one.

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:29.415
That's my Prius!

01:26:29.486 --> 01:26:31.283
- OK. Where's your truck?
- My truck?

01:26:31.354 --> 01:26:33.413
I had to give it back to the hotel.

01:26:33.490 --> 01:26:36.084
What do you mean
you gave it back to the hotel?

01:26:36.159 --> 01:26:37.490
Come here!
Come here!

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:39.892
Sorry!

01:26:41.331 --> 01:26:43.196
It's for a good cause!

01:26:46.035 --> 01:26:48.367
Have you ever driven a motorcycle?

01:26:48.438 --> 01:26:49.769
No!

01:27:20.937 --> 01:27:22.632
Oh, my God!

01:27:26.309 --> 01:27:28.243
No, no, no, no!

01:27:33.216 --> 01:27:34.808
Ooh! Yah! Booya!

01:27:45.728 --> 01:27:48.959
Have you seen Bobbi? Patrick?

01:27:49.032 --> 01:27:51.398
Bobbi! Patrick!

01:27:53.436 --> 01:27:55.165
What are you going to do?

01:28:14.157 --> 01:28:15.852
I'll take that back.

01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.685
No fair!

01:28:19.762 --> 01:28:23.198
Hey, people, that's 60 seconds!
Whoo-hoo!

01:28:23.266 --> 01:28:26.167
Wait! Wait a minute!
I can't find my children!

01:28:26.236 --> 01:28:28.363
- They might be in there!
- Nice try.

01:28:28.438 --> 01:28:31.271
We cleared the building hours ago. OK?
Everything is fine.

01:28:33.576 --> 01:28:35.373
No! Let me through!

01:28:35.445 --> 01:28:38.437
Hey, we got to check the rooms
before we start making booms.

01:28:38.515 --> 01:28:40.312
We've checked it already!

01:28:40.383 --> 01:28:41.611
Do it myself.

01:28:43.019 --> 01:28:45.681
Uncle Skeeter!

01:28:45.755 --> 01:28:48.223
Hey! Get out of there!

01:28:48.291 --> 01:28:49.690
- Five...
- No!

01:28:49.759 --> 01:28:51.283
- Grab the bar!
- Four...

01:28:52.529 --> 01:28:54.497
Three...

01:28:55.131 --> 01:28:56.723
Two...

01:28:56.799 --> 01:28:57.788
One!

01:29:04.541 --> 01:29:07.476
The king has issued a proclamation.

01:29:08.478 --> 01:29:10.571
The hotel moves away.

01:29:10.647 --> 01:29:13.047
The school will stay.

01:29:13.116 --> 01:29:15.346
Long live Webster Elementary!

01:29:20.690 --> 01:29:21.850
- Mom!
- Mom!

01:29:21.925 --> 01:29:23.483
Bobbi! Patrick!

01:29:24.761 --> 01:29:25.955
Oh!

01:29:28.464 --> 01:29:32.264
Hey, hey, hey.
You guys underdemeciated me.

01:29:32.335 --> 01:29:34.963
Come here! I just got to know you guys.

01:29:35.038 --> 01:29:37.506
You think I'm gonna let
you slip away from me now?

01:29:37.574 --> 01:29:40.202
I knew you were the good guy.

01:29:40.276 --> 01:29:41.675
Yeah.

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:45.771
Uh, Patrick, hi.
I'm Trisha Sparks.

01:29:45.848 --> 01:29:49.147
I just wanted you to know that...
thanks for saving the school.

01:29:51.187 --> 01:29:52.882
Western. Go Western.

01:29:52.956 --> 01:29:57.620
- No thanks necessary, ma'am.
- That's my boy. That's my boy.

01:29:57.694 --> 01:30:01.790
There must be some way for me
to show my appreciation.

01:30:01.864 --> 01:30:07.564
Oh-ho-ho! Get it.

01:30:08.705 --> 01:30:12.698
Ooh! Hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:30:12.775 --> 01:30:14.436
Hey, isn't she a little old for you?

01:30:14.510 --> 01:30:17.479
- She's hot.
- So is she. What do you think?

01:30:17.547 --> 01:30:19.344
If Master Stinky's getting a kiss,

01:30:19.415 --> 01:30:22.543
shouldn't, shouldn't I get
a little mermaid action?

01:30:22.619 --> 01:30:24.678
- Come on, already.
- Ooh!

01:30:39.035 --> 01:30:41.629
<i> Now look what my boy has done.</i>

01:30:41.704 --> 01:30:44.537
<i>Turned his back on the world</i>
<i>of luxury hotel management</i>

01:30:44.607 --> 01:30:47.599
<i>to start a small family business.</i>

01:30:47.677 --> 01:30:51.841
<i>And bless his heart,</i>
<i>he even named it after me.</i>

01:30:51.914 --> 01:30:55.213
Hey, speaking of s'mores,
it looks like Bugsy ate them all.

01:30:57.253 --> 01:30:59.118
We're completely out of marshmallows.

01:30:59.188 --> 01:31:02.555
Oh, all right. Let me handle that.
Room service!

01:31:04.661 --> 01:31:06.686
- Yes, sir?
- Hi, Kendall.

01:31:06.763 --> 01:31:08.287
Uh, Bugsy's out of marshmallows.

01:31:08.364 --> 01:31:10.924
If you could just go get him some,
that would be great.

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.592
Right on it, sir.
Anything else?

01:31:12.669 --> 01:31:14.762
Uh, not from you, Kendall, but, uh...

01:31:14.837 --> 01:31:16.498
...Housekeeping?

01:31:17.840 --> 01:31:19.467
Hey, Aspen.

01:31:19.542 --> 01:31:21.908
Could you just make sure
that Bugsy's cage is clean

01:31:21.978 --> 01:31:23.570
before he checks out in the morning?

01:31:23.646 --> 01:31:26.513
His marshmallows don't agree with him,
there's gonna be a mess.

01:31:30.086 --> 01:31:31.348
All right.

01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:34.186
OK, bye, guys.

01:31:34.257 --> 01:31:36.589
<i> I think Bugsy</i>
<i>is trying to tell us</i>

01:31:36.659 --> 01:31:38.627
<i>that our tale has reached its end.</i>

01:31:38.695 --> 01:31:40.424
<i>But before I go, let me tell you</i>

01:31:40.496 --> 01:31:42.896
<i>what our heroes and villains</i>
<i>are doing now.</i>

01:31:42.965 --> 01:31:44.865
<i>My old friend, Barry Nottingham,</i>

01:31:44.934 --> 01:31:47.494
<i>overcame his fear of germs</i>
<i>to such a degree</i>

01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:49.902
<i>that he decided to leave</i>
<i>the hotel business</i>

01:31:49.972 --> 01:31:52.566
<i>and enter the field of medicine.</i>

01:31:52.642 --> 01:31:56.942
<i>He is currently the school nurse</i>
<i>at Webster Elementary.</i>

01:31:57.013 --> 01:31:59.277
<i>Violet now runs the hotel empire,</i>

01:31:59.348 --> 01:32:01.748
<i>along with her husband, Mickey,</i>

01:32:01.818 --> 01:32:03.877
<i>the former room service waiter</i>

01:32:03.953 --> 01:32:06.786
<i>who is now the ninth-richest</i>
<i>person in the world.</i>

01:32:07.924 --> 01:32:09.858
<i>And Skeeter and Jill?</i>

01:32:09.926 --> 01:32:13.362
<i>After the double wedding of the century,</i>

01:32:13.429 --> 01:32:18.059
<i>they lived... well, happily ever after,</i>

01:32:18.134 --> 01:32:19.897
<i>running Marty's Motel</i>

01:32:19.969 --> 01:32:23.200
<i>and spending a lot of time</i>
<i>with my grandkids,</i>

01:32:23.272 --> 01:32:26.036
<i>whose adventures have just begun.</i>

01:32:26.109 --> 01:32:30.136
<i>Though, not everyone</i>
<i>is quite so excited.</i>

01:32:30.213 --> 01:32:33.011
<i>But that is a whole other story.</i>

01:32:33.082 --> 01:32:34.879
<i>The end.</i>

01:32:37.353 --> 01:32:39.583
<i># Don't stop believing</i>

01:32:40.890 --> 01:32:44.018
