YEAH!

00:44.544 --> 00:46.588
YEAH!

00:46.671 --> 00:47.630
EXCELLENT, ALBERT.

00:47.714 --> 00:50.675
{\an1}OK, CLASS, TIME TO HAND IN
LAST NIGHT'S HOMEWORK.

00:53.678 --> 00:56.014
DON'T TELL ME
YOU FORGOT TO DO

00:56.097 --> 00:57.307
THE HOMEWORK...
AGAIN.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.977
{\an1}I DIDN'T FORGET. I DID IT.
I JUST CAN'T FIND IT.

01:01.060 --> 01:04.355
MAYBE YOU SHOULD THINK
ABOUT GETTING ORGANIZED.

01:04.438 --> 01:06.316
I'M PLENTY ORGANIZED.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.360
YOUR HOMEWORK,
MR. BIGBY?

01:16.409 --> 01:19.287
[BOOM]

01:34.552 --> 01:35.720
{\an1}SO YOU DID
THE HOMEWORK,

01:35.804 --> 01:36.763
ONLY YOU LEFT IT
AT HOME...AGAIN?

01:36.846 --> 01:38.848
HOMEWORK, HANDOUTS,
PROJECTS--

01:38.932 --> 01:40.934
{\an5}IT'S A LOT
TO KEEP TRACK OF
IN THE MORNING!

01:41.017 --> 01:42.519
FRANKLY, SCHOOL
IS OVERWHELMING.

01:42.602 --> 01:44.604
{\an1}THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE TO
GET ORGANIZED.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.190
LOOK AT ALBERT.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.192
I BET HE'S NEVER FORGOTTEN
HIS HOMEWORK IN HIS LIFE.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.409
YEAH.
BUT HE'S SCARY.

01:58.493 --> 02:00.703
MY LOCKER'S
NICE, TOO.

02:02.288 --> 02:05.500
AAH! AAH!

02:05.583 --> 02:07.627
OH...

02:12.882 --> 02:14.342
I...

02:14.425 --> 02:17.178
{\an1}WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
SPEAK!

02:17.262 --> 02:18.888
I WENT TO GET
A FRUIT-FILLED

02:18.972 --> 02:21.057
GRANOLA BAR FROM
THE VENDING MACHINE

02:21.140 --> 02:24.185
WHEN IN ITS SLOT WAS
MINI POWDERED DONUTS!

02:24.269 --> 02:28.314
{\an4}WHAT? FRUIT-NOLA IS
OUR FAVORITE SNACK
AT SNACK TIME!

02:28.398 --> 02:29.858
MOVE!

02:31.234 --> 02:33.903
{\an1}A CLUTTERED LOCKER
LEADS TO A CLUTTERED MIND.

02:33.987 --> 02:36.865
BUT IF YOU'D GET
MORE ORGANIZED,

02:36.948 --> 02:39.325
{\an1}YOU'D FIND YOUR BRAIN
WOULD WORK MUCH MORE SMOOTHLY.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.411
ALL I NEED TO FIND
RIGHT NOW

02:41.494 --> 02:42.745
IS MY MATH NOTEBOOK.

02:42.829 --> 02:44.873
AND MY BRAIN
IS NOT CLUTTERED.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.627
IT'S SO CLUTTERED IN HERE,
I CAN'T STAND IT!

02:49.711 --> 02:50.795
OK.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.381
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR THE NOTEBOOK, PEOPLE.

02:53.464 --> 02:55.174
WHERE'S THE NOTEBOOK?

02:55.258 --> 02:56.009
I HAVE NO IDEA!

02:56.092 --> 02:59.304
{\an1}I'M SURPRISED HE REMEMBERS
HIS OWN NAME!

02:59.387 --> 03:01.389
DON'T WORRY. I WILL
CHECK THE FLOOR.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.391
AAH!

03:03.474 --> 03:06.060
OH...

03:06.144 --> 03:08.938
OH, GREAT.
NICE MOTION, MOTION.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.732
OH, DON'T GET
SO EMOTIONAL!

03:10.815 --> 03:12.859
HELLO. HELLO.

03:12.942 --> 03:14.777
{\an5}AND WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE
ANYWAY, HUH?

03:14.861 --> 03:17.906
{\an1}OH! I'M
HIS FEMININE SIDE.

03:17.989 --> 03:19.949
{\an5}NO, I THINK YOU'RE
HIS PFFFFT SIDE,
ALL RIGHT?

03:20.033 --> 03:23.077
AND YOU, WHY AREN'T YOU
SAYING SOMETHING?

03:23.161 --> 03:23.953
YOU'RE SPEECH.
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.706
OH, I TALK!
IT'S JUST IMPOSSIBLE

03:26.789 --> 03:28.291
TO GET ANYTHING DONE
AROUND HERE!

03:28.374 --> 03:30.126
{\an1}THIS IS A PIG STY!
I CAN'T WORK LIKE THIS!

03:30.209 --> 03:30.668
BOTH OF YOU,
BE QUIET!

03:30.752 --> 03:33.713
I CAN'T THINK!

03:33.796 --> 03:35.006
OH...

03:35.089 --> 03:36.299
ARE YOU OK?

03:36.382 --> 03:38.635
I THINK I'M
GETTING A HEADACHE.

03:42.221 --> 03:43.723
EXCUSE ME.
WHAT HAPPENED

03:43.806 --> 03:45.224
TO THE FRUIT-FILLED
GRANOLA BARS?

03:45.308 --> 03:46.976
I WAS TOLD NOT
TO DELIVER THEM.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.562
{\an1}WHAT SICKO STOPS
THE DELIVERY

03:49.646 --> 03:51.064
{\an1}OF HEALTHY
FRUITY GRANOLA

03:51.147 --> 03:53.733
AND REPLACES THEM WITH
MINI POWDERED DONUTS?!

03:53.816 --> 03:56.861
YEAH! MY MINI
POWDERED DONUTS!

03:58.446 --> 04:01.199
HA HA HA! WHOO!

04:05.244 --> 04:07.830
{\an1}Together: WE HAVE TO DO
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.

04:07.914 --> 04:08.873
I HOPE YOU ALL
REMEMBERED

04:08.957 --> 04:11.876
THAT WEDNESDAY
IS QUIZ DAY!

04:12.919 --> 04:16.547
HE FORGOT
IT WAS QUIZ DAY!

04:16.630 --> 04:18.675
GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.
PERFECT.

04:18.757 --> 04:19.591
TAKE OUT
A PIECE OF PAPER

04:19.676 --> 04:22.971
{\an5}AND WRITE DOWN
THE 5 PARTS
OF THE BRAIN.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.348
[ALARMS BLARING]

04:25.431 --> 04:27.892
PLEASE TELL ME WE GOT
A PENCIL IN THERE. PLEASE!

04:29.185 --> 04:34.190
LANCE, DO YOU HAVE
A PENCIL I COULD BORROW?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.068
I...ALWAYS COME PREPARED.

04:37.151 --> 04:40.279
{\an1}AND HERE'S AN ERASER
FOR YOUR MISTAKES

04:40.363 --> 04:41.864
{\an1}AND A TISSUE
FOR WHEN YOU FAIL

04:41.948 --> 04:45.368
{\an1}AND START CRYING,
MORON!

04:45.451 --> 04:45.952
THANKS.

04:46.035 --> 04:48.329
OK, FOLKS.
COME ON, TEAM.

04:48.413 --> 04:51.666
LET'S WORK TOGETHER,
AND LET'S FIND THOSE ANSWERS!

04:51.749 --> 04:53.918
COME ON, MEMORY.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.298
WE'RE GONNA FAIL.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.300
SO, WHAT I HEAR
YOU SAYING

05:01.384 --> 05:03.219
AND COOK AGREEING
WITH YOU RIGHT AFTER IS

05:03.302 --> 05:04.846
YOU WANT ME TO PUT
THE FRUIT-NOLA

05:04.929 --> 05:08.391
BACK IN THE VENDING
MACHINE?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.018
WE JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S FAIR

05:10.101 --> 05:10.560
{\an5}THAT OUR FAVORITE
SNACK HAS BEEN
ELIMINATED.

05:10.643 --> 05:11.686
{\an1}I AGREE.

05:11.769 --> 05:15.064
GRANOLA IS BARFY!

05:15.148 --> 05:18.026
AND I GREW UP
ON MINI POWDERED DONUTS.

05:18.109 --> 05:22.071
MINI POWDERED DONUTS ARE
WHAT MADE THIS COUNTRY GREAT.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.365
SO MY ANSWER IS NO.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.201
BYE!

05:31.748 --> 05:33.249
WHAT'S THE
TROUBLE, BOYS?

05:33.332 --> 05:34.834
CRUBBS TOOK AWAY
OUR FAVORITE SNACK.

05:34.917 --> 05:37.295
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT IT.

05:37.378 --> 05:37.920
GOMPERS!

05:38.004 --> 05:39.714
{\an1}WHAT-ERS?

05:38.004 --> 05:39.714
WHAT-ERS?

05:39.797 --> 05:40.339
SAMUEL GOMPERS,

05:40.423 --> 05:43.426
A GREAT ORGANIZER
OF LABOR.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.887
TIRED OF THE LITTLE GUY
GETTING STEPPED ON,

05:45.970 --> 05:47.096
{\an5}HE ORGANIZED
THE WORKERS,
CREATED UNITY,

05:47.180 --> 05:49.724
AND GOT BETTER
WORKING CONDITIONS

05:49.807 --> 05:51.976
ACROSS
THIS GREAT LAND!

05:52.060 --> 05:54.312
{\an1}SO YOU'RE SAYING WE SHOULD
ORGANIZE THE STUDENTS

05:54.395 --> 05:56.064
AND STAND UP TO CRUBBS

05:56.147 --> 05:57.106
FOR OUR FRUIT-FILLED
GRANOLA BAR RIGHTS!

05:57.190 --> 06:00.485
AS FORMER PRINCIPAL,
I CANNOT CONDONE

06:00.568 --> 06:03.613
ANY ORGANIZED
STUDENT PROTEST...

06:03.696 --> 06:06.657
BUT, UH...IF I
WERE YOUR AGE,

06:06.741 --> 06:08.993
I'D FIND A WAY

06:09.077 --> 06:12.538
TO STICK IT
TO THE MAN.

06:14.123 --> 06:17.668
ARE WE GOING TO LET THE SCHOOL
TAKE AWAY OUR FAVORITE SNACKS?

06:17.752 --> 06:18.377
{\an5}NO!

06:17.752 --> 06:18.377
NO!

06:17.752 --> 06:18.377
NO!

06:18.461 --> 06:20.838
AND ARE WE
GOING TO BE SILENT

06:20.922 --> 06:23.049
AND LET THEM
WALK ALL OVER US?

06:23.132 --> 06:24.258
{\an5}NO!

06:23.132 --> 06:24.258
NO!

06:23.132 --> 06:24.258
NO!

06:24.342 --> 06:26.469
AND ARE WE GOING TO
GET TO CLASS

06:26.552 --> 06:28.429
BEFORE YOU ALL
GET DETENTION?

06:28.513 --> 06:30.807
{\an5}YES!

06:28.513 --> 06:30.807
YES!

06:28.513 --> 06:30.807
YES!

06:38.981 --> 06:42.568
YOUR SHIRT'S
INSIDE-OUT.

06:44.028 --> 06:44.862
OH!

06:44.946 --> 06:47.031
{\an1}I LAY OUT MY CLOTHES
EVERY NIGHT BEFORE SCHOOL

06:47.115 --> 06:48.616
{\an1}SO I DON'T LOOK
LIKE A DORK!

06:50.868 --> 06:52.453
NICE BACKPACK!

06:55.081 --> 06:57.834
I FORGOT
IT WAS QUIZ DAY.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.795
{\an1}SCHOOL CAN BE
OVERWHELMING, MR. BIGBY.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.339
{\an1}BUT IT CAN BE MANAGED
IF YOU TAKE

07:03.422 --> 07:04.382
{\an1}EXTRA TIME
TO GET ORGANIZED.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.886
EXTRA TIME? HAVE YOU SEEN
YOUR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS?

07:08.970 --> 07:11.764
THIS QUIZ WAS A WARM-UP
FOR THE TEST ON FRIDAY,

07:11.848 --> 07:15.184
WHICH IS THE LAST ONE
BEFORE REPORT CARDS!

07:15.268 --> 07:17.186
SINCE TODAY
IS STILL QUIZ DAY,

07:17.270 --> 07:20.106
MAYBE I COULD GET
A MAKE-UP QUIZ.

07:20.189 --> 07:23.317
{\an1}DON'T DO IT!
HE'S HOPELESS!

07:25.027 --> 07:26.654
COME BY MY ROOM
AT SIXTH PERIOD.

07:26.737 --> 07:28.698
AND NO EXCUSES
THIS TIME!

07:31.075 --> 07:33.661
{\an1}SIGN THE "BRING BACK
FRUIT-NOLA BARS" PETITION.

07:34.745 --> 07:37.039
YES!

07:38.916 --> 07:41.043
235 SIGNATURES.
THAT'LL SHOW--

07:41.127 --> 07:42.670
VICE-PRINCIPAL
CRUBBS.

07:42.753 --> 07:44.755
WE HAVE A PETITION
FOR YOU.

07:44.839 --> 07:47.758
WHICH CLEARLY SHOWS
THAT A MAJORITY OF POLKSTERS

07:47.842 --> 07:50.595
{\an1}WANT FRUIT-NOLA BARS,
NOT MINI POWDERED DONUTS.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.387
{\an1}WELL, THIS IS
IMPRESSIVE,

07:51.470 --> 07:54.432
{\an1}AND I'M GOING TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THESE.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.600
YES!

07:54.515 --> 07:55.600
YES!

07:55.683 --> 07:57.393
WHICH, OF COURSE,
MAY TAKE A WHILE,

07:57.476 --> 08:00.479
{\an1}PROBABLY AROUND...
OH, SAY, GRADUATION!

08:00.563 --> 08:03.232
HA HA HA! MMM! MMM!

08:03.316 --> 08:05.026
BYE! HA HA HA!

08:05.109 --> 08:08.404
UH! WE CAN'T
JUST GIVE UP.

08:08.487 --> 08:09.947
WHAT ARE WE
GOING TO DO,

08:10.031 --> 08:11.657
{\an1}SIT AROUND
AND DO NOTHING?

08:11.741 --> 08:12.450
WAIT. THAT'S IT.

08:12.533 --> 08:14.869
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
WE'RE GOING TO DO.

08:14.952 --> 08:16.537
I DON'T GET IT.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.424
[GONG]

08:28.507 --> 08:30.343
SWEENEY'S
MAKE-UP QUIZ!

08:31.802 --> 08:34.388
AAH!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.852
LET ME GUESS.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.854
YOU FORGOT
ABOUT THE QUIZ.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.856
{\an5}OR DID YOU SIMPLY
SPEND THE LAST
10 MINUTES

08:43.940 --> 08:45.274
LOOKING
FOR A PENCIL?

08:45.358 --> 08:46.859
OR YOU LEFT YOUR
BRAIN AT HOME AGAIN

08:46.943 --> 08:48.110
ALONG WITH
YOUR NOTEBOOK?

08:48.194 --> 08:49.779
I'M HAVING A BAD WEEK!

08:49.862 --> 08:52.198
OF COURSE YOU ARE, AND
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE,

08:52.281 --> 08:55.451
UNLESS YOU GET EXPERT
ORGANIZING HELP...

08:55.534 --> 08:56.786
WHICH I'VE ARRANGED.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.372
{\an1}FROM WHO?

09:22.228 --> 09:24.981
{\an8}YOU'VE GOT TO
GET RID OF CLUTTER

09:25.064 --> 09:27.567
{\an8}IN YOUR BACKPACK
AND LOCKER

09:27.650 --> 09:28.693
{\an8}ONCE A WEEK.

09:31.612 --> 09:34.240
{\an8}AND ALWAYS
GO CALENDAR.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.825
{\an8}MARK DOWN WHEN
PROJECTS AND QUIZZES

09:35.908 --> 09:36.409
{\an8}ARE DUE FOR CLASS

09:36.492 --> 09:39.620
{\an8}AND WHEN
THE BIG TEST IS.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.336
{\an8}PICKING OUT CLOTHES

09:47.420 --> 09:49.338
{\an8}IS THE BIGGEST
MORNING-TIME WASTER.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.340
{\an8}SO EVERY NIGHT BEFORE SCHOOL,
LAY OUT YOUR CLOTHES.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.968
{\an8}YOU'LL HAVE MORE TIME
IN THE MORNING

09:54.051 --> 09:56.554
{\an8}TO GET YOUR BACKPACK
TOGETHER...

09:56.637 --> 09:58.889
{\an7}AND HAVE EVERYTHING
YOU NEED FOR THE DAY.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.518
ALWAYS HAVE
WRITING UTENSILS HANDY.

10:02.601 --> 10:05.771
DESIGNATE SPECIFIC LOCATIONS
FOR YOUR WALLET,

10:05.855 --> 10:06.856
KEYS, AND I.D. CARD,

10:06.939 --> 10:10.526
AND NEVER SPEND A MINUTE
LOOKING FOR THEM AGAIN.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.654
AND GO...ACCORDION FOLDER.

10:13.738 --> 10:16.198
ORGANIZE THE SLOTS FOR HOMEWORK,
PERMISSION SLIPS, PROJECTS,

10:16.282 --> 10:17.950
AND WHATEVER ELSE
YOU NEED,

10:18.034 --> 10:19.744
AND YOU'LL NEVER LOSE AN
IMPORTANT PIECE OF PAPER AGAIN.

10:19.827 --> 10:22.204
AWESOME.

10:22.288 --> 10:24.915
BUT I'M NOT GOING
WITH THE FANNY PACK.

10:24.999 --> 10:28.794
{\an1}Together: FOLLOW THESE RULES,
AND YOU'LL DO BETTER IN SCHOOL.

10:33.090 --> 10:35.384
SO IF YOU'RE DISORGANIZED
