00:00.300 --> 00:02.466
- From the moment we met...
<i>- We knew our lives</i>

00:02.566 --> 00:04.967
<i>would never be the same.</i>
He saved my life.

00:04.969 --> 00:06.684
<i>And she saved mine.</i>

00:06.755 --> 00:08.189
<i>We're destined.</i>

00:08.191 --> 00:11.025
<i>But we know it won't be easy.</i>

00:11.027 --> 00:13.387
<i>Even though we have</i>
<i>every reason to stay apart...</i>

00:13.798 --> 00:15.348
<i>We'll risk it all</i>
<i>to be together.</i>

00:15.606 --> 00:17.639
I am so in love with you.

00:19.910 --> 00:21.777
I am starting to think that
you're hiding something.

00:21.779 --> 00:23.863
I'm starting to think
the same thing.

00:23.865 --> 00:25.331
I got in contact
with some people

00:25.333 --> 00:27.950
who will destroy this
thing once and for all.

00:27.952 --> 00:29.368
Muirfield?

00:29.370 --> 00:31.153
It was an experiment--
Vincent, he was a soldier.

00:31.155 --> 00:33.005
No one can know.

00:34.207 --> 00:35.374
Remember that woman
I told you about?

00:35.376 --> 00:36.458
Catherine.

00:36.460 --> 00:37.643
You have a thing for her.

00:39.000 --> 00:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:52.443 --> 00:54.643
There you go, sir.

01:07.357 --> 01:08.357
That was fast.

01:08.359 --> 01:09.959
You said it was urgent.

01:09.961 --> 01:10.943
I came.

01:10.945 --> 01:12.795
It is.

01:12.797 --> 01:14.396
And is this
urgent information

01:14.398 --> 01:16.415
the reason you're hitting
the sauce at noon?

01:16.417 --> 01:18.167
Sauce?

01:18.169 --> 01:19.685
This is Lochlynn 18.

01:19.687 --> 01:22.588
The reason I'm drinking it
is none of your business.

01:22.590 --> 01:25.557
I found your creature.

01:27.844 --> 01:30.462
Your team are gonna have
to sweep the tunnels.

01:30.464 --> 01:34.099
I saw that thing enter a sewer
pipe near Varick and Spring.

01:34.101 --> 01:35.834
I think that's where
he's been hiding out.

01:35.836 --> 01:37.853
And you picked up
the trail where?

01:37.855 --> 01:39.939
Does it matter?

01:39.941 --> 01:43.075
Forgive me
if I'm being skeptical,

01:43.077 --> 01:44.726
but before I put
ten agents at risk,

01:44.728 --> 01:46.679
I'd like to know that
your intel is solid.

01:46.681 --> 01:48.781
Unless you want
the trail to go cold,

01:48.783 --> 01:51.850
I suggest you drop the questions
and deploy your team.

01:51.852 --> 01:54.336
The intel is solid.

01:54.338 --> 01:56.571
Sit down, have a drink.

01:56.573 --> 01:58.123
Yeah, we'll have
a celebratory one, after.

01:58.125 --> 02:01.410
Look, if anything goes wrong,

02:01.412 --> 02:03.429
I want you to be protected.

02:03.431 --> 02:05.914
Creature mace?

02:05.916 --> 02:07.449
It's a panic button.

02:08.518 --> 02:10.602
Muirfield takes care of its own.

02:26.936 --> 02:29.638
They certainly do look out
for their own.

02:44.288 --> 02:45.671
What the hell?

02:45.673 --> 02:46.722
Buddy, what's your problem?

02:46.724 --> 02:47.756

04:22.069 --> 04:23.235
Hey.

Uh,  Vincent.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.685
and about the, the tunnels
the other day.

04:39.687 --> 04:41.403
I just, um...

04:41.405 --> 04:44.173
I-I don't want things to be,
you know, weird between us.

04:44.175 --> 04:47.025
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
the whole manimal thing

04:47.027 --> 04:48.594
is a lot to wrap my head around.

04:48.596 --> 04:51.079
But you did
save my neck.

04:51.081 --> 04:53.348
And hers.

04:53.350 --> 04:55.300
It's kind of hard
to hate on that.

04:55.302 --> 04:56.802
Thank you.

04:56.804 --> 04:59.921
Um, and I just,
I-I want you to know

04:59.923 --> 05:02.090
that I would never hurt her.

05:02.092 --> 05:03.942
Well, you better not,
'cause I don't care

05:03.944 --> 05:05.594
what kind
of super soldier you are.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.696
If you did, I...
Okay, and we are going to the roof.

05:07.698 --> 05:08.714
Sorry to leave you
hanging.

05:08.716 --> 05:10.482
Uh, it's, it's okay.

05:10.484 --> 05:12.018
I can, I can actually do
my own laundry.

05:12.043 --> 05:12.869
Right.

05:12.870 --> 05:14.036
'Cause that's
what you two

05:14.038 --> 05:15.037
were about to do.

05:15.039 --> 05:16.038
Sorry to sock-block,
big guy.

05:16.040 --> 05:17.072
Okay.

05:18.292 --> 05:19.958
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:19.960 --> 05:22.127
I'm just really trying
to get used to all this.

05:22.129 --> 05:25.380
You know, first he was
a serial killer we were chasing.

05:25.382 --> 05:27.166
And now he's Hulk
with a heart of gold.

05:27.168 --> 05:29.551
You should see him
with his shirt off.

05:31.088 --> 05:32.804
I did not just say that.

05:32.806 --> 05:34.256
But since you did...

05:34.258 --> 05:37.843
No, no, sex questions--
those are off limits.

05:37.845 --> 05:39.728
Aw, God, you're
such a prude.

05:39.730 --> 05:40.762
Trust me, I'm not.

05:44.083 --> 05:48.036
Okay, before I dig
myself in any deeper, um,

05:48.038 --> 05:50.138
there are some things
we need to talk about.

05:50.140 --> 05:52.307
Serious things.

05:52.309 --> 05:54.076
About protecting Vincent.

05:54.078 --> 05:55.577
Pretty much

05:55.579 --> 05:58.363
everything I do is
to make sure Muirfield

05:58.365 --> 06:00.032
or the cops don't find him.

06:00.034 --> 06:01.783
Look, I told you-- you don't
have to worry about me.

06:01.785 --> 06:03.151
I'm keeping his secret.

06:03.153 --> 06:04.753
Tess, this isn't
just any secret.

06:04.755 --> 06:06.588
If Muirfield finds him

06:06.590 --> 06:08.907
or anyone who's close to him...

06:10.126 --> 06:11.826
They're dead.

06:13.830 --> 06:16.331
Okay, if you're...

06:16.333 --> 06:18.934
if you're all in
with us on this,

06:18.936 --> 06:20.769
your entire life--
it's gonna change

06:20.771 --> 06:23.272
just like mine did, so...

06:23.274 --> 06:26.642
you have to decide for yourself
if you want this.

06:30.981 --> 06:33.649
Chandler.

06:35.985 --> 06:38.853
Uh, yeah, okay,
I'll be right there.

06:38.855 --> 06:39.955
What's wrong?

06:39.957 --> 06:40.956
Central Booking.

06:40.958 --> 06:42.824
Evan's in the drunk tank.

06:43.776 --> 06:46.528
Open up number three, please.

06:57.557 --> 06:59.508
You punched a guy at a bar?

06:59.510 --> 07:00.842
I had to.

07:00.844 --> 07:02.210
To see you.

07:02.212 --> 07:04.546
They were watching me.

07:04.548 --> 07:06.565
Who was watching you?

07:06.567 --> 07:09.568
I think we both
know who they are.

07:09.570 --> 07:12.688
The people who want
to catch your, um,

07:12.690 --> 07:14.356
new boyfriend.

07:14.358 --> 07:16.525
Uh, boyfriend?
I don't know...

07:16.527 --> 07:17.943
What I don't
understand is

07:17.945 --> 07:19.828
how you could choose him.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.446
A monster.

07:21.448 --> 07:24.166
'Cause that's what he is.

07:24.168 --> 07:25.917
You know that, right?
I don't know

07:25.919 --> 07:27.536
what you are talking about...
Just stop.

07:27.538 --> 07:28.704
Okay, stop.

07:30.740 --> 07:33.492
We have been playing
this game for a year now.

07:33.494 --> 07:36.795
It's done.

07:36.797 --> 07:39.548
I saw you last night with him.

07:41.184 --> 07:43.185
On your fire escape.

07:43.187 --> 07:45.420
Kissing him.

07:45.422 --> 07:47.189
Kissing that...

07:47.191 --> 07:48.307
that thing.

07:48.309 --> 07:50.859
Evan...
What?

07:50.861 --> 07:51.910
You gonna tell me
that I'm wrong?

07:51.912 --> 07:53.612
Go ahead.

07:53.614 --> 07:55.731
Tell me that it's PTSD
from almost getting

07:55.733 --> 07:56.898
mauled in the tunnels.

07:56.900 --> 07:58.400
Or, or that I misinterpreted

07:58.402 --> 08:00.786
his DNA on your scarf.

08:00.788 --> 08:02.621
Come on.

08:02.623 --> 08:05.407
I want to hear you spin what
I saw with my own two eyes.

08:05.409 --> 08:08.210
You have no idea

08:08.212 --> 08:10.111
who or what he is.

08:10.113 --> 08:13.081
What he is, is a danger to you

08:13.083 --> 08:14.833
and everyone around you.

08:14.835 --> 08:16.585
According to who?

08:16.587 --> 08:19.504
Your friends at Muirfield?

08:19.506 --> 08:23.124
The only reason I
joined them was

08:23.126 --> 08:25.794
to help them erase
their mistake

08:25.796 --> 08:28.847
before it succumbs to its
animal nature entirely

08:28.849 --> 08:30.065
and kills you, too.

08:30.067 --> 08:32.467
He would never do that.
Why?

08:32.469 --> 08:34.102
Because he loves you?

08:38.640 --> 08:40.692
Look at me, the fool.

08:40.693 --> 08:42.110
Trying to protect you.

08:42.111 --> 08:43.828
Even as we speak.

08:43.831 --> 08:45.313
Do you really think that

08:45.315 --> 08:48.083
your feelings for this-this
monster are real?

08:48.085 --> 08:49.584
Evan, I know

08:49.586 --> 08:51.253
that you care about me,

08:51.255 --> 08:54.172
but...

08:56.793 --> 08:58.993
Wait.

09:00.463 --> 09:03.882
What do you mean,
protecting me even as we speak?

09:03.884 --> 09:05.967
Evan.

09:05.969 --> 09:07.519
Evan, what did you do?

09:07.521 --> 09:10.021
Why did you bring me here?
Why now?

09:10.023 --> 09:13.892
So I'd know you'd be safe
when they came for him.

09:13.894 --> 09:15.444
No.

09:15.446 --> 09:16.445
Hey!

09:16.447 --> 09:17.512
Cat!

09:17.514 --> 09:20.315
Cat, stay away from him.

09:20.317 --> 09:22.167
Cat!

09:22.169 --> 09:24.185
Thanks for helping me
move these.

09:24.187 --> 09:25.487
Did you do
laundry at Cat's?

09:25.489 --> 09:27.021
Maybe, why?

09:27.023 --> 09:28.707
'Cause your spring rain
scent is drowning out

09:28.709 --> 09:30.625
the raw sewage
and rat droppings.

09:30.627 --> 09:33.879
Yeah, well, imagine it
with my sense of smell.

09:33.881 --> 09:36.782
Oh, crap, um, I'm late.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.200
It's okay, give
me the stuff.

09:39.202 --> 09:41.620
Thanks for the assist,
big guy.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.172
Catch you topside?

10:04.694 --> 10:06.778
Any maintenance personnel
supposed to be down here?

10:06.780 --> 10:08.563
Negative-- that's
our target.

10:08.565 --> 10:09.748
Let's move.

10:24.847 --> 10:26.047
Go, go, go, go.

10:26.049 --> 10:28.183
Move, move left.

10:29.051 --> 10:31.419
Turn right...

10:32.254 --> 10:35.390
Clear.

10:37.343 --> 10:38.727
Where the hell
did he go?

10:40.596 --> 10:42.597
That's not possible.

10:42.599 --> 10:44.699
He can't do that.

10:46.202 --> 10:49.137
We don't know what he can do.

these Muirfield guys--

they knew

11:20.455 --> 11:22.455
I'm talking
precise coordinates.

11:22.457 --> 11:24.874
It just, it doesn't
make sense.

11:24.876 --> 11:26.842
It does.

11:26.844 --> 11:30.212
Um, Evan tipped them off.

11:33.183 --> 11:34.683
How do you know?

11:34.685 --> 11:38.721
He told me.

11:38.723 --> 11:41.774
He saw us together
at my apartment two nights ago,

11:41.776 --> 11:45.027
and then he followed you
to the tunnels from there.

11:46.279 --> 11:49.097
Maybe if I had just been
honest with him sooner.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.533
Catherine, come on,
it's not your fault.

11:50.535 --> 11:52.368
It <i>is</i> my fault.

11:52.370 --> 11:58.440
I let him take things too far,
especially his feelings for me.

11:58.442 --> 12:00.209
You should have
heard him.

12:00.211 --> 12:01.610
What'd he say?

12:01.612 --> 12:03.996
That we could never be together,

12:03.998 --> 12:07.750
that our love would
never work out.

12:09.553 --> 12:11.453
He was upset.

12:11.455 --> 12:13.839
He sent a death squad after me.

12:13.841 --> 12:15.257
Which is why I need

12:15.259 --> 12:17.059
to talk to him
and convince him

12:17.061 --> 12:19.461
that you're not the monster
that he thinks you are.

12:19.463 --> 12:21.430
If he can bring
Muirfield to your door,

12:21.432 --> 12:22.765
he can lure them away.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.400
No, you're in
enough danger as it is.

12:24.402 --> 12:26.485
I think it's about time
I talk to him.

12:26.487 --> 12:27.970
Okay, I don't see
that ending well.

12:27.972 --> 12:30.105
Listen, Catherine,
they're gonna ask him

12:30.107 --> 12:32.307
how he picked up
on my trail, okay?

12:32.309 --> 12:34.660
And he may deflect
a few times, but eventually

12:34.662 --> 12:37.580
they will stop asking nicely
and he will give you up.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.783
Okay, you know it's true,
and I can't let that happen.

12:40.785 --> 12:43.085
You're gonna have to,
'cause you can't walk

12:43.087 --> 12:46.422
into my precinct
for a little mano a mano.

12:46.424 --> 12:48.507
I can take care of this, okay?

13:08.778 --> 13:10.846
What are you doing?
And where's Evan?

13:10.848 --> 13:12.364
That is a good
question.

13:12.366 --> 13:14.283
He hasn't shown up
for work today.

13:14.285 --> 13:15.935
So you're tearing apart
his morgue?

13:15.937 --> 13:16.952
I don't see

13:16.954 --> 13:17.953
a reason to stop.

13:17.955 --> 13:20.355
Unless of course he said
something to you

13:20.357 --> 13:22.491
in the tank about the vigilante.

13:23.660 --> 13:25.027
I have connections, too.

13:25.029 --> 13:28.998
Evan is my friend,
that's why I went to see him.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.584
And last I heard,
the vigilante was dead.

13:31.586 --> 13:32.751
And I have some questions

13:32.753 --> 13:34.119
about the circumstances
surrounding his death.

13:34.121 --> 13:36.589
I don't understand
why you're singling Evan out.

13:36.591 --> 13:39.391
Believe me, I'm not.

13:44.514 --> 13:46.715
My desk drawer was cracked
open this morning.

13:46.717 --> 13:49.435
Was that you?
You going through my things?

13:49.437 --> 13:51.403
Yeah. You're light
on number two pencils,

13:51.405 --> 13:53.022
and I think those oatmeal
packets expired

13:53.024 --> 13:54.156
about a decade ago.

13:54.158 --> 13:57.076
I'm sure you have a warrant
for all of this.

13:57.078 --> 13:58.427
I wrote it myself this morning.

13:58.429 --> 14:00.412
On the grounds of
"obstruction of justice."

14:00.414 --> 14:03.249
Should I be getting
my union rep involved?

14:04.618 --> 14:06.835
We have a mole
in the department.

14:06.837 --> 14:09.838
That chemical warehouse
blowing up just as we arrived?

14:09.840 --> 14:12.174
It's all a bit too much
of a coincidence.

14:12.176 --> 14:13.926
And I'm a suspect.

14:13.928 --> 14:15.261
Right now our M.I.A.

14:15.263 --> 14:17.546
medical examiner is
the chief suspect,

14:17.548 --> 14:19.414
but no one's been ruled out.

14:32.812 --> 14:35.397
Don't even think
about calling her.

14:36.533 --> 14:37.783
What are you doing here?

14:37.785 --> 14:39.368
Trying to stop you

14:39.370 --> 14:43.105
from getting Catherine killed
like you tried with me.

14:43.107 --> 14:44.823
They would have bugged
your phone by now.

14:44.825 --> 14:46.325
You push send,
and they will

14:46.327 --> 14:48.410
track her down
and they will kill her.

14:51.264 --> 14:52.798
Now what?

14:52.800 --> 14:55.084
You gonna rip out my throat?

14:55.086 --> 14:56.302
Oh, it's tempting.

14:57.754 --> 14:59.338
But here's your other option:

14:59.340 --> 15:01.757
you're gonna pick up
my trail somewhere else,

15:01.759 --> 15:03.509
somewhere that
Muirfield will follow.

15:03.511 --> 15:04.860
Somewhere you want
to live,

15:04.862 --> 15:07.329
where you can get lost
and never come back.

15:07.331 --> 15:08.797
That's it? I just
abandon Catherine

15:08.799 --> 15:10.049
into your so-called hands?

15:10.051 --> 15:11.850
You have no idea
of the people

15:11.852 --> 15:13.402
you just signed up
with, do you?

15:13.404 --> 15:14.903
They're dangerous.

15:14.905 --> 15:17.856
And you're not?
The vigilante who's killed

15:17.858 --> 15:19.191
countless New Yorkers?

15:19.193 --> 15:21.510
Cat's better off with
a menace like you?

15:23.663 --> 15:25.647
She seems to think so.

15:25.649 --> 15:27.700
She's just fascinated by you.

15:27.702 --> 15:29.618
That's the only reason
why she's with you.

15:29.620 --> 15:31.086
Or maybe she's
in love with me.

15:31.088 --> 15:34.840
You really think dragging
her into your world,

15:34.842 --> 15:37.843
forcing her into some
twisted relationship

15:37.845 --> 15:39.428
with a monster is
protecting her?

15:39.430 --> 15:41.630
How long do you think
this fairy tale will last?

15:41.632 --> 15:42.965
You're on the wrong side.

15:42.967 --> 15:45.100
You need to stop
this hunt now.

15:45.102 --> 15:47.353
Hunt? You're to blame.

15:47.355 --> 15:50.505
You knew that Muirfield
were after you and yet you put

15:50.507 --> 15:52.207
Catherine right in
the middle of it all.

15:52.209 --> 15:53.692
You put her life
on the line

15:53.694 --> 15:55.644
just so you could
selfishly be with her.

15:55.646 --> 15:57.730
Are you really so naive to think

15:57.732 --> 16:00.282
that this black ops agency is
just gonna let Catherine go?

16:00.284 --> 16:01.993
I know them.

16:02.018 --> 16:04.018
I know they'll ask you
if you found me.

16:04.521 --> 16:06.321
How long do you think
you'll last

16:06.323 --> 16:07.790
before you give up her name?

16:07.792 --> 16:08.791
I would never.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.125
They have killed men
ten times

16:10.127 --> 16:11.744
stronger than you.
When push comes

16:11.746 --> 16:12.961
to shove, you will break.

16:12.963 --> 16:14.863
And then who's
the threat to her?

16:14.865 --> 16:17.199
There won't be a threat
once you're gone.

16:21.704 --> 16:23.138
Oh, oh, sorry.

16:23.140 --> 16:24.556
It's okay.
I'm so sorry

16:24.558 --> 16:26.541
about that.
It's okay, sir.

16:26.543 --> 16:28.677
Hey!

16:35.318 --> 16:36.852
Hey!

16:36.854 --> 16:38.737
Hey, last car,
stop running!

16:38.739 --> 16:41.940
I will not let you hurt her.

16:41.942 --> 16:43.776
What do you think you
can really offer her?

16:43.778 --> 16:45.894
Do you think Cat wants to
hide out like hunted prey

16:45.896 --> 16:47.229
for the rest of her life?

16:47.231 --> 16:49.031
She deserves to
be with a man.

17:36.296 --> 17:40.048
This is Evan Marks.
Please leave a message.

17:40.050 --> 17:42.934
Hey, what's with the creep
at six o'clock?

17:44.837 --> 17:47.105
That's Vincent's roommate.

17:53.279 --> 17:54.946
Okay.

17:54.948 --> 17:57.515
Uh...

17:59.402 --> 18:02.137
I haven't decided anything.
I'm just listening.

18:03.706 --> 18:04.689
So, is she cool?

18:04.691 --> 18:06.524
Cooler than you in a
ladies' locker room.

18:07.326 --> 18:09.744
I'm JT Forbes.
Yeah.

18:09.746 --> 18:11.446
I'm sorry
about the whole tranq thing.

18:11.448 --> 18:13.798
What tranq thing?
Can we skip this part?

18:13.800 --> 18:16.534
Happily. So, Vincent showed up
at campus warning me not

18:16.536 --> 18:17.869
to go back the tunnels.

18:17.871 --> 18:19.871
I know about the raid.

18:19.873 --> 18:21.723
Yeah, well, then he proceeded
to storm out, saying

18:21.725 --> 18:24.392
he was gonna deal with it once
and for all. Dude was pissed.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.361
Do we have any idea
where he was going?

18:26.363 --> 18:28.179
No, but I'd say at the top
of the list

18:28.181 --> 18:29.280
of people pissing him off...

18:29.282 --> 18:30.899
Evan.

18:31.717 --> 18:33.151
He's involved
in this, too?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.819
He thinks I'm in danger
because of Vincent

18:34.821 --> 18:37.021
and that giving me up
will somehow protect me.

18:37.023 --> 18:39.908
I got worried so I tried tracing
a tracking app

18:39.910 --> 18:41.776
I put on his burner
in case of emergencies.

18:41.778 --> 18:43.161
And?

18:43.163 --> 18:45.046
And I narrowed his location
to a four-block radius

18:45.048 --> 18:46.397
on the edge of the city.

18:46.399 --> 18:48.833
And then, surprise,
the signal was jammed.

18:49.802 --> 18:51.619
It's them, isn't it?

18:51.621 --> 18:53.338
That's my guess.
Okay, can you guys stop

18:53.340 --> 18:55.290
talking in code?
Muirfield got closer

18:55.292 --> 18:56.758
than they've ever been
to him last night.

18:56.760 --> 18:58.460
And they usually don't knock
just once.

18:58.462 --> 18:59.544
They've got him. We gotta go.

18:59.546 --> 19:00.628
Let me see that.

19:00.630 --> 19:01.713
I'm not leaving you

19:01.715 --> 19:03.164
with the geek
squad as backup.

19:18.531 --> 19:20.365
I've been here an hour.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.700
Any chance
I can go home now?

19:22.702 --> 19:24.302
Kyle wants you
to wait here.

19:24.304 --> 19:27.739
He has a few more
questions for you.

19:27.741 --> 19:29.290
He's an intense guy.

19:29.292 --> 19:31.826
I barely know what this is.

19:31.828 --> 19:34.162
I mean, personnel everywhere,
labs on lockdown.

19:34.164 --> 19:36.998
Seems like a lot of activity
to catch one target.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.334
I mean, unless this is more

19:39.336 --> 19:41.469
than just the apprehension
of the creature.

19:43.172 --> 19:45.006
I get it.

19:45.008 --> 19:46.558
You don't even know yourself.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.309
I mean, a man at your level,

19:48.311 --> 19:49.794
you probably have
to ask permission

19:49.796 --> 19:51.062
to go to the bathroom.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.430
What am I
even talking

19:52.432 --> 19:54.349
to you for?

19:54.351 --> 19:57.018
I mean, you're a Muirfield
man, right?

19:57.020 --> 19:59.303
Believe in the mission
and all that.

19:59.305 --> 20:01.689
You don't know what I believe.

20:01.691 --> 20:04.492
What <i>do</i> you believe in?

20:07.312 --> 20:09.164
You should take a seat.

20:15.539 --> 20:18.006
I'm going to the restroom.

20:19.091 --> 20:21.009
Don't go anywhere.

21:28.410 --> 21:30.745
♪

21:51.717 --> 21:53.601
Oh, my...

21:53.603 --> 21:55.252
<i>Someone want to tell me why</i>

21:55.254 --> 21:57.555
<i>an empty building has</i>
<i>more volts coursing</i>

21:57.557 --> 21:58.840
through it
than the Pentagon?

21:58.842 --> 22:00.975
Looks like Muirfield

22:00.977 --> 22:02.860
is up and running.
Half the power's probably

22:02.862 --> 22:04.261
feeding that fence.

22:05.263 --> 22:06.564
Nice.

22:06.566 --> 22:08.149
I got to get rid
of my hatchback.

22:08.151 --> 22:09.784
So, what now?

22:09.786 --> 22:11.703
There's a transformer close by

22:11.705 --> 22:14.038
supplying power to all
the buildings in the area.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.641
We take that out and we get
past the electrified fence.

22:16.643 --> 22:18.676
I'll help TJ.
It's JT.

22:18.678 --> 22:20.028
It's not just the fence

22:20.030 --> 22:21.546
we have to worry about.

22:21.548 --> 22:22.948
Unless they're
having an open house,

22:22.949 --> 22:24.882
how am I supposed
to get in the door?

22:24.884 --> 22:26.935
All right, that's the point
of a stakeout.

22:30.839 --> 22:32.757
See that?

22:36.628 --> 22:38.563
Their security doors
are voice recognition.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.583
Okay, how's that gonna help?
I doubt we're on the list.

22:40.608 --> 22:41.466
Maybe

22:41.467 --> 22:42.684
we aren't, but what about Evan?

22:42.686 --> 22:44.068
He wouldn't have
had clearance yet,

22:44.070 --> 22:45.987
but his ex from Muirfield would.

22:45.989 --> 22:48.439
You were monitoring
Evan's phone calls, right?

22:48.441 --> 22:51.326
Do you have any old
voice mails from Claire?

22:56.815 --> 22:59.117
All right, do you see
any transformers?

22:59.119 --> 23:02.286
'Cause I'm just looking at a
sea of "not transformers".

23:02.288 --> 23:04.505
Keep looking.
Should be right here.

23:04.507 --> 23:07.425
Wait a minute.

23:07.427 --> 23:10.044
Why do you have
a constipated look on your face?

23:10.046 --> 23:12.296
Maybe we're
standing on it.

23:12.298 --> 23:15.083
Uh, there's got to be
a ventilation system.

23:15.085 --> 23:17.268
Come on, come on.

23:17.270 --> 23:19.170
This it?

23:20.189 --> 23:21.356
Perfect.

23:22.808 --> 23:24.892
Hey, look, don't take this
as a personal criticism,

23:24.894 --> 23:27.278
but you can't fit down
a seven inch vent pipe.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.447
I can reach it from here.

23:32.718 --> 23:35.653
Wow, I carry a gun,
you carry IEDs?

23:35.655 --> 23:37.321
Homemade.

23:41.210 --> 23:46.964
Let's go. Ten, nine,
eight, seven, come on, six.

23:46.966 --> 23:48.966
Come on.

24:06.769 --> 24:09.937
Hey, Evan, it's Claire.
My flight's been delayed, but...

25:37.390 --> 25:39.424
You are something else.

25:39.426 --> 25:42.027
The way you escaped
in those tunnels.

25:42.029 --> 25:45.563
Phew, I've never seen
anything like that.

25:45.565 --> 25:48.066
But I knew
we'd find you

25:48.068 --> 25:49.618
eventually.

25:51.654 --> 25:55.073
That makes two of us.

25:56.942 --> 25:58.710
Which one are you?

25:58.712 --> 26:00.578
Agent J or K?

26:00.580 --> 26:03.548
Well, I can tell you one thing,
I'm not Agent Cole.

26:03.550 --> 26:05.300
I'm assuming you're
the reason he disappeared?

26:05.302 --> 26:08.920
Hmm. Older Muirfield agent?
Kind of thought he was suave?

26:08.922 --> 26:10.388
Yeah.

26:11.424 --> 26:14.209
You are a fearless man.

26:14.211 --> 26:16.978
Unfortunately,

26:16.980 --> 26:19.731
this is the end of the line
for you.

26:19.733 --> 26:25.303
You gonna chop me up, dissect
me, feed me to a giant juicer?

26:25.305 --> 26:28.840
Isn't that what you deserve?

26:29.942 --> 26:31.609
Except, nowadays,

26:31.611 --> 26:35.213
we pump you full of adrenaline,

26:35.215 --> 26:37.782
keeping you
wide awake

26:37.784 --> 26:42.337
while the surgeon unzips you
like a duffel bag.

26:58.804 --> 27:00.805
You can't
stop progress.

27:02.108 --> 27:04.893
Sir, we have
a security breach. Confirm.

27:04.895 --> 27:06.677
We have a security breach.

27:25.214 --> 27:26.965
Muirfield haven't stopped
their experiments.

27:26.967 --> 27:28.917
They're trying to make
a new generation

27:28.919 --> 27:30.418
of crosspecies creature.

27:30.420 --> 27:33.505
And you're just
putting this together now?

27:33.507 --> 27:37.185
They want to cut you open
and see what make you tick.

27:37.186 --> 27:39.686
They know what makes me tick,
they made me.

27:40.647 --> 27:42.514
I was part

27:42.516 --> 27:45.100
of a highly classified,
secret military experiment

27:45.102 --> 27:47.736
to create a unit
of super soldiers.

27:47.738 --> 27:49.720
These people
are lethal.

27:49.722 --> 27:52.824
Okay? That's why JT tried
to stop you from joining them.

27:53.776 --> 27:56.661
You know JT Forbes?
Yeah,

27:56.663 --> 27:58.413
we grew up together.
Picture becoming clearer

27:58.415 --> 27:59.531
for you now?

27:59.533 --> 28:01.065
Grew up?

28:01.067 --> 28:04.669
I-- you mean, they didn't...
What, grow me

28:04.671 --> 28:05.670
in a petri dish?

28:05.672 --> 28:08.423
Is that what
you think?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.508
I-I thought maybe
they intervened

28:10.510 --> 28:12.877
at the embryonic stage.

28:15.848 --> 28:21.853
My name is Vincent Ryan Keller,
Specialist, United States Army.

28:21.855 --> 28:25.190
Okay, these people
destroyed my life.

28:25.192 --> 28:26.691
They injected me...

28:26.693 --> 28:29.694
With cross-species DNA.

28:29.696 --> 28:31.095
Yeah.

28:31.097 --> 28:32.597
The experiments

28:32.599 --> 28:35.033
went wrong.
They couldn't control us,

28:35.035 --> 28:37.368
they couldn't control
their side effects.

28:37.370 --> 28:40.288
And now they want to improve
upon their mistakes.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.375
They lied to me.

28:44.377 --> 28:46.110
They said that
they just wanted

28:46.112 --> 28:47.745
to tie up loose ends.

28:47.747 --> 28:49.130
Yeah, well, now

28:49.132 --> 28:52.617
you and Catherine
are those loose ends.

28:52.619 --> 28:54.385
So, if anything
happens to her,

28:54.387 --> 28:56.821
it is on
your hands.

28:59.791 --> 29:03.895
I... I don't know
if I can save her.

29:29.872 --> 29:31.005
Evan!

29:33.492 --> 29:34.659
Who'd you let in here?

29:34.661 --> 29:36.761
Go to hell.

29:43.052 --> 29:45.836
How you gonna get there
before me?

30:09.378 --> 30:11.663
Who breached security?

30:22.641 --> 30:26.644
For the last time,
who breached security?

30:26.646 --> 30:28.513
Who did you let in here?!

30:28.515 --> 30:31.349
Even if I did know who
the infiltrator was,

30:31.351 --> 30:34.102
I'd never tell you.

30:34.104 --> 30:36.688
You might as
well kill me.

30:36.690 --> 30:39.023
I was planning on it.

30:43.162 --> 30:46.414

31:14.276 --> 31:16.527

Catherine.
I can't leave Evan.

31:47.310 --> 31:49.143
Catherine, I got to
get you out of here.

31:55.060 --> 31:55.902
Evan.

31:55.903 --> 31:57.085
Cat,

31:57.087 --> 31:58.953
you shouldn't have come.

31:58.955 --> 32:00.955
Vincent, oh my, God.

32:00.957 --> 32:03.007
Give me your jacket.
Here.

32:13.552 --> 32:14.852
I'm not sure.

32:14.854 --> 32:16.137
We're gonna get you out of here.

32:16.139 --> 32:17.940
Get you help, you'll heal,
and you'll get back

32:17.941 --> 32:19.591
to your life.
And I'm gonna

32:19.593 --> 32:21.542
somehow convince Gabe
that you're not a mole.

32:21.544 --> 32:23.594
He thinks I'm the mole?

32:23.596 --> 32:24.979
You or me.

32:24.981 --> 32:26.915
He's on
a hunt to

32:26.917 --> 32:29.433
track down whoever's leaking
the task force plans.

32:30.536 --> 32:33.738
If he thinks it's you...

32:33.740 --> 32:35.239
It doesn't matter.

32:35.241 --> 32:37.108
We're going to get through this.

32:37.110 --> 32:39.127
Catherine,
we got to go.

32:40.963 --> 32:42.413
Cat, listen to him.

32:43.799 --> 32:45.216
Run.

32:48.504 --> 32:50.471
No one's running
without you. Come on.

32:50.473 --> 32:52.289
Okay, there's an exit in the
underground electrical tunnels.

32:52.291 --> 32:53.841
I'm gonna make sure
the coast is clear.

32:53.843 --> 32:55.960
Okay, come
on, slowly.

32:57.514 --> 32:59.314
Wait.

32:59.316 --> 33:01.966
Are you gonna tell her
about her parents?

33:01.968 --> 33:04.319
I found it in her
mother's file.

33:04.321 --> 33:06.437
You know, don't you?

33:06.439 --> 33:08.639
Yes.

33:08.641 --> 33:11.242
Look, we can't tell her, okay?

33:11.244 --> 33:14.145
Just give me your weight,
come on.

33:21.036 --> 33:22.987
That door wasn't in the plans.

33:25.258 --> 33:28.426
Hey, come on,
it's okay.

33:30.662 --> 33:33.097
Can you open it?

33:33.099 --> 33:35.049
I don't know.

33:35.051 --> 33:37.852
I'll give it a go,
okay?

33:52.234 --> 33:56.187
An SOS message isn't really
gonna help us right now.

34:18.678 --> 34:20.311
Holy...

34:25.851 --> 34:28.152
We need more time.

34:31.857 --> 34:34.609

Catherine, we're not all getting
out of here.

34:37.197 --> 34:38.996
No.

34:38.998 --> 34:41.732
No, we are all
going to get out.

34:44.837 --> 34:46.954
I let my feelings
for you blind me

I thought that Vincent
was a threat.

34:55.748 --> 34:57.815
I called Muirfield.

34:57.817 --> 35:00.184
No, you didn't know. You
couldn't... you couldn't know.

35:00.186 --> 35:02.120
Muirfield need to be stopped.

35:02.122 --> 35:03.638
I see that now.

If I can help you and him

35:05.558 --> 35:07.191
get out of here alive...

35:08.728 --> 35:11.062
...I'll be really
protecting you.

35:11.064 --> 35:14.015
It'd be the best thing
that I've ever done in my life.

35:14.017 --> 35:17.368
The point of it, really.

36:00.863 --> 36:02.163

37:18.750 --> 37:21.135
what happened to Evan,

I know what happened to Evan.

You do?

37:24.790 --> 37:25.873
Yeah.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.291
He skipped town.

37:27.293 --> 37:28.525
He was the mole.

Yeah, for a minute there,
I thought

37:37.703 --> 37:39.386
you might have had
some kind of involvement.

37:39.388 --> 37:41.605
What changed your mind?

37:41.607 --> 37:45.593
I received a confession
from Evan.

37:45.595 --> 37:47.595
Received?

37:47.597 --> 37:49.013
How?

37:49.015 --> 37:50.431
By e-mail.

37:50.433 --> 37:52.900
Quite the statement, too.

37:52.902 --> 37:54.151
He said that he'd been covering

37:54.153 --> 37:55.836
for the vigilante
this whole time,

37:55.838 --> 37:58.889
that he was a symbol
of heroism in an age

37:58.891 --> 38:02.076
where justice had become
encumbered by red tape.

38:05.530 --> 38:07.498
He took the blame.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.167
He is to blame.

38:10.169 --> 38:12.402
Our I.T. department verified
the e-mail was sent

38:12.404 --> 38:14.237
from his cell phone
last night.

38:14.239 --> 38:16.941
It appears to be
the real deal.

38:16.943 --> 38:20.344

the walls closing in on him.

Maybe you should.

38:49.292 --> 38:51.875
I almost got you killed,

38:51.877 --> 38:54.078
and Evan died,

38:54.080 --> 38:56.497
and he took the blame
for me at the precinct.

38:56.499 --> 38:58.382
Catherine, come on.

38:58.384 --> 39:00.551
You were willing to
sacrifice your own life

39:00.553 --> 39:02.336
to try and help him,

39:02.338 --> 39:04.305
even after he betrayed you.

Hey.

39:07.059 --> 39:10.594

39:19.471 --> 39:21.405
No, Evan made his own decisions.

He did what he did
because he cared about you.

39:25.027 --> 39:26.910

way too much responsibility.

If I hadn't shown up
at the warehouse

39:34.670 --> 39:37.037
after we first met,
you would have left town.

39:37.039 --> 39:38.539
Muirfield never would have
found you.

39:38.541 --> 39:41.792
How does that
make you selfish?

39:44.596 --> 39:49.049
I should have pushed you away,
but I pulled you closer.

39:49.051 --> 39:51.501

was to meet you,

40:06.902 --> 40:09.686

40:13.542 --> 40:17.294

out who I was,

40:17.296 --> 40:20.414

not to tell anyone...

40:20.416 --> 40:22.383

40:22.385 --> 40:25.502
That was the best
day of my life.

40:27.371 --> 40:29.372
Vincent...

40:29.374 --> 40:32.176
No, it was, and I
know it was wrong.

40:32.178 --> 40:35.396
I know I should have run
right then and there,

40:35.398 --> 40:38.248
