01:45.406 --> 01:46.474
Hello?

01:49.510 --> 01:51.779
- Get the hell away from us!
- It's ok man, just relax.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.214
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.183
What do you want?

01:55.216 --> 01:56.450
Nothing.

01:56.484 --> 01:57.851
I just want to help.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.220
My name is Johnny

01:59.253 --> 02:01.189
I work at the Los Angeles teen
shelter.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.723
I heard you guys were held up
here.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.758
Is that some kind of church
thing?

02:04.792 --> 02:07.328
No, nothing like that.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.662
We're not going back to the
shelters.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.265
That's ok.

02:11.299 --> 02:13.534
You don't have to do
anything you don't want to do.

02:15.436 --> 02:17.238
What's in the bag?

02:17.271 --> 02:20.208
Breakfast. Want some?

02:35.723 --> 02:37.358
Wait, Cooper,

02:37.391 --> 02:40.661
we don't know this
guy, what if he's a creep?

02:40.694 --> 02:43.964
That's smart.
It's good to be careful.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.833
Let me just take a bite,
to prove that it's good.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.713
When was the last time you guys
had something to eat?

02:59.747 --> 03:02.450
Tuesday.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.452
It's really good.

03:04.485 --> 03:06.587
Look, there's a lot more where
that came from.

03:06.620 --> 03:10.824
We got showers, clean clothes,
all at the shelter. Beds, too.

03:10.858 --> 03:14.228
Please, I haven't had a shower
in weeks.

03:14.262 --> 03:17.331
We go to the shelter, and they'll
send you back to your stepfather.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.433
Hey, wait, wait, wait!

03:21.802 --> 03:23.771
Nobody's going to send you
anywhere that you don't want to go.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.606
We're nongovernmental,

03:25.639 --> 03:27.441
we don't give your names
to the cops,

03:27.475 --> 03:29.510
we don't even make you live in
the shelter,

03:29.543 --> 03:31.379
we got no curfew,
nothing.

03:31.412 --> 03:33.547
We're just trying to help.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.750
We got showers, food, clean
clothes,

03:36.784 --> 03:38.586
You can take what you
want, and leave the rest.

03:38.619 --> 03:41.389
No cops, and no curfew?

03:41.422 --> 03:43.524
That's right.

03:43.557 --> 03:44.958
How about you just
come take a look?

03:44.992 --> 03:49.463
If you don't like what you see,
you can walk away.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.831
What do you got to lose?

03:55.469 --> 03:56.737
Let's go.

03:56.770 --> 03:57.738
Come on.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.612
Here we are.

04:09.517 --> 04:10.684
Oh yeah it's just right in here.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.022
- No! Hey!
- No, stop! Stop!

04:17.391 --> 04:19.527
Get in there!

05:09.710 --> 05:10.778
Who's this?

05:10.811 --> 05:12.513
I picked up some new
merchandise.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.915
How many?

05:14.948 --> 05:17.718
Two. Just like you asked.
A boy and a girl.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.454
How do they look?

05:20.488 --> 05:24.091
How do they always look?
Young and dirty, like they're homeless.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.828
The homeless kids don't last long, the
syndicates are looking for some healthier stock.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.533
Yeah, I'm working on it.

05:32.566 --> 05:36.737
But healthy kids are difficult,
Elena. They take time.

05:36.770 --> 05:42.610
Look, I don't care how long it takes, stop
whining like a little bitch and get it done.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.711
Hey, Emma, get up!

06:35.195 --> 06:36.430
Emma!

06:38.198 --> 06:40.734
- Hey!
- Hey, you're back early!

06:40.768 --> 06:41.835
New record.

06:41.869 --> 06:44.171
Is this the start of your
midlife crisis kicking in?

06:44.204 --> 06:46.940
Maybe, I'm thinking about
getting a Maserati next week.

06:46.974 --> 06:48.909
- Oh, that'd be nice!
- Mhm.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.177
Yeah, you're not driving it.

06:50.210 --> 06:52.713
Hey, did you get a new locket?

06:52.746 --> 06:56.750
Yeah, I put dad's photos
inside.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.159
Are you ok?

07:06.193 --> 07:08.462
Yeah, Mom, I'm fine.

07:08.496 --> 07:10.664
Emma, it's alright to miss him,
I miss him, too.

07:10.698 --> 07:14.067
Seriously, I'm ok. It's been a
year already.

07:18.038 --> 07:19.540
Where's my photo?

07:19.573 --> 07:20.774
Oh, my gosh, Mom!

07:20.808 --> 07:23.477
I don't need a photo of you,
you follow me everywhere I go.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.846
That's because you're so cute.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.481
Come have breakfast with me.

07:27.515 --> 07:29.883
- Mom!
- Come on!

07:32.553 --> 07:34.454
Eat!

07:35.789 --> 07:38.559
- Mom, I'm not really hungry.
- Come on.

07:38.592 --> 07:41.729
Gosh. You're such a control
freak.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.531
I am not a control freak.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.132
Yeah you are, you're
a helicopter.

07:45.165 --> 07:47.167
What? I'm a what?

07:47.200 --> 07:48.902
A helicopter, Mom.
You're always hovering.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.270
Where's this coming from?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.105
You don't let me drive.

07:52.139 --> 07:53.607
Because you don't have a
California license yet.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.342
You don't let me date.

07:55.375 --> 07:58.979
- Who do you want to date?
- I don't know, but Mom, I'm 16, I should be allowed to date.

08:02.683 --> 08:04.585
You're right, I know.

08:04.618 --> 08:07.721
So, I can date?

08:07.755 --> 08:10.658
Um, you can date, but I have
to meet him first.

08:10.691 --> 08:11.892
Ok!

08:11.925 --> 08:13.927
I really gotta get going.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.195
But, Mom, it's Saturday?

08:15.228 --> 08:16.263
I still have to work.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.998
But you promised you'd take me
to the mall first.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.733
- When did I promise that?
- Yesterday.

08:19.767 --> 08:22.536
Uh...

08:22.570 --> 08:25.105
I'll take you to the mall if you
eat breakfast.

08:31.344 --> 08:34.548
- Where do you want--
- Oh, right here.

08:36.616 --> 08:37.951
- Alright.
- Alright.

08:37.985 --> 08:38.818
- Wow, wow!
- Bye!

08:38.852 --> 08:40.153
Wow, how are you getting back
home?

08:40.187 --> 08:41.789
Courtney's going to drop me off,
ok?

08:41.822 --> 08:44.625
Courtney!

08:44.658 --> 08:48.762
- Hey, Emma, what's up?
- Hey, Courtney!

08:48.796 --> 08:50.030
- Hey!
- Hi!

08:50.063 --> 08:52.099
I'm Katherine Hudson, nice to
meet you.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.835
You, too, Mrs. Hudson.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.870
Alright, well, we're going to
go, so I'll see you later.

08:56.904 --> 08:57.905
Well, what about my hug?

09:00.173 --> 09:01.875
Hug your mom, Emma!

09:04.011 --> 09:06.213
I love you so much.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.816
I love you, too.

09:08.849 --> 09:10.350
Bye.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.085
- Alright, bye!
- Have a good time.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.254
Bye, thank you.

09:14.287 --> 09:17.925
Oh, my God, I just met this guy
last week, he's so boss,

09:17.958 --> 09:19.292
- You're going to love him.
- OK

09:40.313 --> 09:42.716
- Hey, girls.
- Hey, Johnny.

09:42.750 --> 09:43.784
- You look nice.
- Thank you.

09:50.758 --> 09:54.227
Adam, this is my friend Emma,
she's from Wisconsin, so be nice.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.897
Oh, Wisconsin's cool!

09:56.930 --> 09:57.931
How are
you liking it in Cali?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.368
It's pretty sweet.

10:01.401 --> 10:02.836
Pretty sweet.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.748
Well, are you guys down
to take a little walk?

10:14.782 --> 10:15.983
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

10:16.016 --> 10:18.085
Alright, let's do it.

10:18.118 --> 10:21.722
This is Emma,
leave a message after the beep. Beep!

11:18.178 --> 11:19.279
Hey!

11:19.312 --> 11:20.748
Katherine, good morning.

11:20.781 --> 11:22.182
- What a great site.
- It is, isn't it?

11:22.215 --> 11:24.918
Yeah.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.987
So look, I was just going over
the plans again

11:27.020 --> 11:29.156
and I want to double check that the
earthquake proofing is all up to code

11:29.189 --> 11:32.359
- because what we have now--
- Oh!

11:32.392 --> 11:34.261
Let me help you with this.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.197
- Get that side, now you get the plans, I'll get the table.
- Ok

11:47.440 --> 11:48.876
There you go, good as new!

11:48.909 --> 11:50.610
You're pretty handy.

11:50.643 --> 11:55.482
Well my dad was a contractor back in Wisconsin,
so I grew up on a construction site.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.819
The plans, they look great, but I'm
concerned about the earthquake resistance,

11:58.852 --> 12:00.788
I don't know if we have enough
steel in here.

12:00.821 --> 12:04.324
Well, I put harmonic absorbers and
a base isolation in the foundation

12:04.357 --> 12:08.295
that reduces the need for steel
cord structure by thirty percent.

12:08.328 --> 12:09.797
You sure about that number?

12:09.830 --> 12:12.365
I'm positive about that number,
but you can double check if you want.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.835
No, no, I believe you.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.837
I have been wanting to ask you
how the move is going, though,

12:16.870 --> 12:18.538
because that's got to be
a big change.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.908
It's great, it's really great.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.343
But I do have a random question
for you.

12:23.376 --> 12:27.447
When I was coming in I saw a missing
person sign on that light post.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.283
And now you're wondering if your
new home is safe.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.519
It is absolutely safe.
100 percent.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.022
You know, a lot of these kids
that go missing,

12:35.055 --> 12:36.556
they're runaways.

12:36.589 --> 12:40.994
It's sad, they're from bad neighborhoods,
and they get into drugs, gangs,

12:41.028 --> 12:42.362
and it's absolutely terrible,

12:42.395 --> 12:45.933
but it's not something that
happens around here.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.334
It's not something that happens
where you live.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.369
In fact, somebody should
probably take that sign down,

12:49.402 --> 12:52.472
Because a developer is going to come,
and it's just going to freak him out.

12:52.505 --> 12:54.107
Yeah, right.

12:54.141 --> 12:56.209
- Are you going back to the office now?
- Yes, right now.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.279
Would you mind taking down that
sign, actually?

12:59.312 --> 13:02.282
- Uh, sure.
- Ok.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.984
- Ok, good luck out here.
- Alright, we'll see you later.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.285
Thank you.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.542
Hey! What are you doing?

13:29.576 --> 13:30.978
Excuse me?

13:31.011 --> 13:32.312
- Why'd you take the sign down?
- The what?

13:32.345 --> 13:34.614
The missing person sign in your
hand, why did you take it down?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.949
I, uh...

13:35.983 --> 13:37.117
Did you find Piper?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.518
No.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.353
Then put it back up.

13:40.387 --> 13:41.421
Excuse me, who are you?

13:41.454 --> 13:43.623
Anna Fray. I'm a case worker
at Saving Innocents.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.325
Saving what?

13:45.358 --> 13:47.427
The anti-human trafficking
agency.

13:47.460 --> 13:50.297
Why'd you take down the sign?

13:50.330 --> 13:53.200
Well, my boss told me that you just
put it in the wrong neighborhood.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.869
Do you know where Piper
was last seen?

13:55.903 --> 13:58.638
The beh. Two miles from here.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.975
Oh, ok. I get it.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.376
I'm really sorry.

14:03.410 --> 14:05.378
How sorry?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.514
You sorry enough to come and
volunteer?

14:07.547 --> 14:09.917
Volunteer for what?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.185
We need people to answer the
hotline tonight.

14:12.219 --> 14:13.653
Oh...

14:13.686 --> 14:16.389
Oh, I'm sorry, I can't, I have to
pick up my daughter from the mall.

14:16.423 --> 14:19.292
Oh, you have a daughter?

14:19.326 --> 14:21.628
How would you feel if it was your
daughter that had been taken?

14:21.661 --> 14:23.063
Excuse me?

14:23.096 --> 14:24.898
What would you say to someone who
took your daughter's sign down?

14:24.932 --> 14:28.168
Ok, I get it, I understand,

14:28.201 --> 14:30.170
and I'm really sorry.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.239
Sorry doesn't cut it.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.873
Don't take down any more signs.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.435
So the movie's called Agave?

15:02.469 --> 15:05.973
Yeah. It's like the Agave plant.

15:06.006 --> 15:10.343
It's a documentary about the
origins of tequila.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.478
It sounds cool.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.779
It's awesome!

15:12.812 --> 15:16.683
Or it would be if Johnny got off
his skinny ass and finished in.

15:16.716 --> 15:20.954
Oh, ok, you know Courtney
happens to like my ass.

15:20.988 --> 15:22.289
It's true, I do.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.095
Are you ok?

15:28.128 --> 15:30.330
Asthma. I'm fine.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.969
- Care to do some research?
- Give me some of that.

15:40.740 --> 15:43.176
That's nasty!

15:44.644 --> 15:47.247
Oh, no. I'm good.

15:47.280 --> 15:51.251
- You don't drink?
- No, I'm in club soccer.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.585
So, you got to keep
in shape.

15:54.487 --> 15:58.125
Oh, ok, she's a good girl,
doesn't want to get mom mad.

15:58.158 --> 16:00.293
Leave her alone,
Johnny.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.562
I think it's cool
that you don't drink.

16:02.595 --> 16:06.099
- What position do you play?
- Midfield.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.734
That's a lot of running.

16:07.767 --> 16:09.436
Yeah it is.

16:09.469 --> 16:11.638
Boring.

16:11.671 --> 16:12.639
You want to get out of here?

16:12.672 --> 16:15.608
A walk on the beach
sounds romantic.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.310
That's me, baby.

16:24.151 --> 16:25.385
So what do you want to do?

16:27.387 --> 16:30.023
Um...

16:30.057 --> 16:32.192
I don't know, what do you want
to do?

16:32.225 --> 16:33.726
I could shoot you.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.030
What?

16:37.064 --> 16:39.266
Like a fashion shoot.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.768
Take some photos, you know.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.504
Yeah, well I think you need a
model for that.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.739
You're as beautiful as any model
I've ever seen.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.190
Hey, Mom?

17:05.558 --> 17:06.626
Can I go to the movies with
Courtney tomorrow?

17:09.362 --> 17:11.431
Maybe, if you tell me who you
were with today.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.768
I wasn't with anybody, just
Courtney.

17:16.769 --> 17:18.305
What about those boys?

17:20.607 --> 17:21.741
What boys?

17:21.773 --> 17:24.111
The two boys that I saw you
with.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.079
- You were spying on me?
- No.

17:26.113 --> 17:28.515
But I told you I want to know
who you're hanging out with.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.217
I'm not hanging out with them.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.552
Are you dating one of these
boys?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.554
Oh my gosh, you are so
embarrassing!

17:34.587 --> 17:37.824
It's ok if you want to start
dating.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.727
I just don't want you sneaking
around behind my back.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.763
- I'm not sneaking behind your back, Mom!
- Good!

17:45.532 --> 17:47.100
Good! I'm glad we got that
cleared up.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.370
What's his name?

17:54.307 --> 17:55.408
What's his name?

17:56.743 --> 17:58.678
- Adam.
- Adam. Adam who?

17:58.711 --> 18:00.113
I don't know.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.481
You don't know his last name?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.883
No, Mom, I just met him.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.218
Is he at your school?

18:05.252 --> 18:07.787
He's a photographer.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.189
- At art school?
- I don't know!

18:09.222 --> 18:12.292
Ok, how old is he?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.726
I don't know,

18:14.927 --> 18:16.028
Nineteen or something.

18:16.062 --> 18:18.831
Nineteen! Don't you think that's
a little old for you?

18:18.865 --> 18:21.134
No, I don't.

18:21.168 --> 18:23.203
Ok, well, I would like to meet
Adam.

18:23.236 --> 18:26.173
Mom, that is not happening.

18:26.206 --> 18:29.909
If you're going to start hanging out with
boys then I need to know who they are.

18:29.942 --> 18:33.480
You can't control who I hang out
with, this isn't Afghanistan.

18:33.513 --> 18:36.649
We'll I'm your mother, and it's my
job to know who your friends are.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.851
You know I wish dad was still
alive because he wouldn't care.

18:47.494 --> 18:51.198
I love you Emma, I really love
you.

18:51.231 --> 18:53.333
And I'm sorry that your dad
isn't here

18:53.366 --> 18:56.736
and I'm sorry if it seems like I'm doing
a horrible job of raising you on my own,

18:56.769 --> 19:00.507
but I am doing the best
that I can.

19:00.540 --> 19:02.409
Whatever, Mom.

19:02.442 --> 19:03.910
I'm going to hang out with Adam,

19:03.943 --> 19:05.345
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

19:05.378 --> 19:08.781
Ok, if you talk to me like that,
Emma Hudson, and you will be grounded.

19:08.815 --> 19:10.183
Grounded, seriously?

19:10.217 --> 19:12.452
Ok, you asked for it, 24 hours.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.222
- You can't ground me, Mom.
- I just did.

19:15.255 --> 19:19.426
- You know, I'm going to my room.
- No!

19:19.459 --> 19:22.762
No! Put your plate in the sink,
please.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.374
Happy, Mom?

19:34.407 --> 19:36.443
Yes, thank you.

21:05.498 --> 21:07.934
So my mom saw us with the
boys yesterday.

21:07.967 --> 21:09.369
I take it that didn't go so
well.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.137
Nope, she grounded me.

21:11.170 --> 21:14.841
- She grounded you?
- Yeah, She thinks I'm like 10 years old or something.

21:14.874 --> 21:16.643
- That's harsh.
- I know.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.511
Hey, girls.

21:18.545 --> 21:20.380
- Hey.
- Hey.

21:20.413 --> 21:21.848
- Hey.
- Hi.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.650
Where's Adam?

21:23.683 --> 21:26.018
He couldn't make it, he came
down with some kind of flu.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.055
That sucks, Emma busted out of mom
lockdown just so she could see him.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.490
No, it's ok.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.525
I got a surprise.
Guess who got a new car?

21:32.559 --> 21:33.893
You didn't!

21:33.926 --> 21:36.929
Black Wrangler. Want to take it
for a spin?

21:36.963 --> 21:40.333
I'm here with Emma, doofus,
we're supposed to go see a movie, remember?

21:40.367 --> 21:41.468
She could fit inside the jeep,
too.

21:41.501 --> 21:43.403
- Yeah.
- Oh, no, you guys go ahead.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.904
Come on!

21:44.937 --> 21:47.440
- No, it's ok.
- Are you sure?

21:47.474 --> 21:49.809
Yeah, seriously.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.345
Ok, love you.

21:52.379 --> 21:54.714
- Let's go. Later.
- Bye.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.999
Coming in.

22:13.032 --> 22:14.066
Emma.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.073
Emma Hudson, you open this door
right now.

22:24.110 --> 22:27.714
Emma, I'm not kidding,
open the door.

22:30.717 --> 22:35.121
Open this door this instant or there's
going to be serious consequences. Emma!

22:37.824 --> 22:39.459
Emma, alright I'm going to take
the lock off

22:45.064 --> 22:46.566
Emma!

22:58.445 --> 23:00.012
I don't believe it.

23:10.790 --> 23:11.858
Hey!

23:12.992 --> 23:14.126
You ok?

23:14.160 --> 23:16.529
Yeah, I'm fine, I thought you
were sick or something.

23:16.563 --> 23:19.699
Yeah, that's what I told Johnny.

23:19.732 --> 23:23.503
But the truth is, I wanted
to hang out with you.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.705
Just the two of us.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.006
That sound ok?

23:27.039 --> 23:29.175
Yeah, that sounds great.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.177
Alright. Come on.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.886
This is Emma,
leave a message after the beep. Beep!

23:39.919 --> 23:43.022
Emma, listen,

23:43.055 --> 23:45.592
I'm sorry, can you just please
call me back.

23:45.625 --> 23:47.126
You're scaring me now. Please!

23:53.032 --> 23:55.635
So, um, when did you move out
here?

23:55.668 --> 23:58.538
About a month ago.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.940
Do you like it?

24:00.973 --> 24:03.042
Yeah.

24:03.075 --> 24:04.110
I like--

24:04.143 --> 24:07.814
- Hey, wow, you ok?
- Um...

24:07.847 --> 24:09.982
Let me help you, let me help
you.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.952
- Come to the shade.
- I don't really feel that good.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.821
Wow!

24:59.265 --> 25:00.933
You ok?

25:00.967 --> 25:04.103
Yeah, yeah, it's she's kind
of a sweet girl.

25:04.136 --> 25:07.674
..., get your head
together, kid.

25:07.707 --> 25:09.909
- Did you do the checklist?
- Yes, just like you said.

25:09.942 --> 25:11.678
- Parents?
- Father's dead.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.012
What about the mother?

25:13.045 --> 25:15.682
They just moved here from Wisconsin,
so she doesn't know anybody.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.083
Phone?

25:17.116 --> 25:18.951
I got it.

25:18.985 --> 25:21.921
Alright, Romeo. Get working on
the next one.

25:21.954 --> 25:25.124
Make sure they're nice and
clean. We got orders coming in.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.238
No, no, Courtney!

26:46.272 --> 26:49.976
No! Stop! Courtney!

26:51.410 --> 26:54.714
No! Please! No!

27:36.923 --> 27:37.857
I found you.

27:53.973 --> 27:55.842
My name is Melena.

27:58.177 --> 28:00.112
I know you must all have a lot
of questions

28:01.280 --> 28:02.314
what's going to happen to you,

28:04.216 --> 28:05.384
When are you going
to see your families again,

28:08.154 --> 28:09.989
I'm going to answer those
questions.

28:13.192 --> 28:17.029
I'm going to tell you the truth
because the sooner you accept the truth,

28:17.063 --> 28:19.365
the easier your new lives
will be.

28:22.234 --> 28:23.302
Your old lives are over.

28:26.505 --> 28:28.841
You will never see your families
again.

28:30.977 --> 28:34.380
If you try to escape, we will track
you down and we will find you.

28:36.448 --> 28:39.318
We have your home addresses, your student
ID's, we know where your families live.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.790
If you try to escape,

28:43.823 --> 28:47.026
we will kill your mother, your
father, your sister, your brother.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.169
You all belong to me now.

28:57.203 --> 29:00.272
You are my property.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.441
And because you're my property,
I'm going to take good care of you.

29:05.144 --> 29:07.279
And in return, you're going to
work for me.

29:11.017 --> 29:13.986
It's important that you
understand the rules.

29:14.020 --> 29:17.356
I want to be clear about my expectations
so that there are no misunderstandings.

29:19.591 --> 29:22.228
Most of the men that you'll be
dating are nice guys,

29:22.261 --> 29:25.898
they're just a little lonely,
a little sad.

29:25.932 --> 29:28.467
They have crappy lives,

29:28.500 --> 29:30.870
and they just need some
attention.

29:32.038 --> 29:34.006
A little fun.

29:34.040 --> 29:36.475
That's your job.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.544
Make them feel good about
themselves,

29:38.577 --> 29:40.079
make them feel special.

29:44.116 --> 29:47.219
You do that,
And we will all get along fine.

29:49.588 --> 29:51.523
You don't,

29:51.557 --> 29:54.560
you fail to satisfy one of my
customers,

29:54.593 --> 29:57.229
and you will be starved.

29:57.263 --> 29:59.098
You fail a second time,

29:59.131 --> 30:01.400
And you will be beaten,

30:01.433 --> 30:03.970
A third time, and I will give
you to my men.

30:07.006 --> 30:10.209
Now, how many of you are
virgins?

30:13.980 --> 30:15.447
Come on, I'm going to find
out sooner or later,

30:15.481 --> 30:18.985
Virgins are very special in my business.
They're worth a lot of money.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.056
So...

30:25.958 --> 30:27.826
how many of you are virgins?

30:32.498 --> 30:33.532
One.

30:37.403 --> 30:38.370
Two.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.514
Three.

30:48.547 --> 30:51.117
That's good.
That's good.

30:55.021 --> 30:57.423
Get them cleaned up
and ready for the photo shoot.

31:35.094 --> 31:36.028
Emma!

31:38.230 --> 31:39.932
Em!

31:53.512 --> 31:54.947
Emma?

32:31.050 --> 32:33.119
911, what's your emergency?

32:33.152 --> 32:34.753
My daughter, she's missing.

32:34.786 --> 32:36.655
Ok, ma'am,
what's your location?

32:36.688 --> 32:39.291
I'm at the North Alley Mall.

32:39.325 --> 32:41.627
Alright,
we have a car in route to that location.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.530
- We just have a couple more questions for you.
- Ok.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.598
How old is your
daughter?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.400
She's sixteen.

32:48.434 --> 32:51.003
Can you describe her
for me?

32:51.037 --> 32:56.675
She has blonde hair to her shoulders,
blue eyes, 5'5", about 108 pounds.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.480
What is she wearing?

33:01.513 --> 33:02.648
I don't know.

33:02.681 --> 33:04.616
You don't know?

33:04.650 --> 33:05.917
I haven't seen her since last
night.

33:05.951 --> 33:07.986
Stay where you are,
we'll be there soon.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.573
Mrs. Hudson, I'm Detective
Richmond,

33:27.606 --> 33:29.075
this is Detective Cordova.

33:29.108 --> 33:30.342
I called you an hour ago.

33:30.376 --> 33:33.112
I'm sorry about that ma'am,
Is your daughter still missing?

33:33.145 --> 33:34.313
Yes, I haven't seen her since
last night.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.048
Has she ever run away before?

33:36.082 --> 33:39.285
She didn't run away, I found
her phone in a dumpster.

33:39.318 --> 33:41.053
- Can you show us?
- Yes.

33:44.390 --> 33:46.425
There's missing person signs all
over the neighborhood,

33:46.458 --> 33:50.396
and I found her phone in this dumpster
and I'm scared that she's been abducted.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.565
- Well do you have any evidence to suggest she's been abducted?
- No.

33:53.599 --> 33:57.136
Chances are she's just fine.
Can I see the phone?

33:57.169 --> 33:59.238
Yeah.

33:59.271 --> 34:00.306
We'll check it for fingerprints.

34:00.339 --> 34:01.640
Ok, how long is that going
to take?

34:01.673 --> 34:03.609
- About a day or so.
- A whole day?

34:03.642 --> 34:06.512
Did you call Emma's father
to see if she was there?

34:06.545 --> 34:08.414
No, he passed away a year ago.

34:08.447 --> 34:09.514
Grandparents, any other family
members?

34:09.547 --> 34:12.518
No, no. We moved here a month
ago from Wisconsin.

34:12.551 --> 34:14.786
We don't have any family except
for each other.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.722
Mrs. Hudson, dispatch told us

34:16.755 --> 34:20.092
you didn't know what your daughter
was wearing today, why was that?

34:20.126 --> 34:22.628
Because we got into a fight last
night, I grounded her,

34:22.661 --> 34:25.531
and she snuck out of the house
this morning.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.199
What was the fight about?

34:27.233 --> 34:29.400
This boy that she met, Adam.

34:29.435 --> 34:30.569
What's Adam's last name?

34:30.601 --> 34:32.471
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

34:32.504 --> 34:34.572
I don't know, she just met him.

34:34.606 --> 34:35.741
Well, how did you find her
phone?

34:35.774 --> 34:37.409
I traced her from her tablet.

34:37.443 --> 34:39.178
And you tried calling her
phone earlier today?

34:39.210 --> 34:41.313
Of course I tried to call her.
Like 20 times.

34:41.347 --> 34:43.215
Maybe that's why she threw it
in the dumpster.

34:43.248 --> 34:44.716
No, she wouldn't have thrown her
phone in the dumpster.

34:44.750 --> 34:45.751
We've seen it before.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.386
But I know my daughter.

34:47.418 --> 34:50.255
She's not officially been
missing for 24 hours.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.524
I told you that I--
We can put her description

34:52.558 --> 34:54.592
on the National Crime
Information Center.

34:54.626 --> 34:55.860
Under what?

34:55.893 --> 34:57.196
Under missing persons.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.666
What about an Amber Alert?
We could do that or a search party?

35:00.699 --> 35:04.403
Like my partner said, we'll put her on the
NCIC. That's the best we can do right now.

35:06.872 --> 35:09.775
What can I do?

35:09.808 --> 35:12.411
You can call on your friends or family
and see if anyone's heard from her.

35:12.444 --> 35:14.380
Here's my card, my number,
and email.

35:14.413 --> 35:17.149
Email me a photo of your daughter
and we'll put it on the site.

35:17.183 --> 35:19.318
I have one on my phone, I can do
that right now.

35:19.351 --> 35:22.421
The best thing you can do right now
is just go home and wait by the phone.

35:22.454 --> 35:25.391
That way, if she comes home or
calls, you'll be there for her.

35:25.424 --> 35:26.892
Just let us handle it from
here.

35:26.925 --> 35:28.460
Ok.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.188
Emma!

35:58.257 --> 35:59.458
Emma!

36:59.485 --> 37:02.454
Come on, get around. Move
it around and come in a line.

37:02.954 --> 37:05.791
Bring it around, form line
over here.

37:11.297 --> 37:12.664
Hello, ladies.

37:15.867 --> 37:18.804
We're going to shoot some stills
and a little video.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.840
You're going to stand
on this carpet,

37:21.873 --> 37:26.778
and smile for the camera just
like the beauty queens you are.

37:26.812 --> 37:29.448
If you work hard, we'll give you
some food.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.920
First up, Courtney, let's go.

37:50.402 --> 37:53.772
Please, Johnny, let me go.

37:53.805 --> 37:54.873
I just want to go home.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.276
This is your home now.

37:59.845 --> 38:03.048
Please.
Please.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.952
You said you loved me.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.689
And I do love you.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.458
Now go stand in the middle of
the carpet.

38:14.726 --> 38:15.961
Yeah?

38:22.033 --> 38:23.902
Let's see that beautiful smile.

38:31.443 --> 38:33.745
Very nice.

38:33.779 --> 38:36.782
Now for the video part, I just
need you to twirl around.

38:41.152 --> 38:44.923
I can't do it, I can't.

38:47.559 --> 38:51.029
Ok, we don't have time for this.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.131
I got to upload this video
in less than three hours.

38:56.435 --> 38:57.536
Ok...

38:57.569 --> 39:00.606
let's try something else.
Ivan...

39:16.622 --> 39:19.124
That's what's going to happen.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.759
Thanks buddy.

39:26.064 --> 39:30.068
I like you Courtney, I don't
want to hurt you.

39:30.101 --> 39:32.671
Melena hates it when we damage
the merchandise.

39:36.608 --> 39:41.413
You're going to stand up right
now, and smile.

39:41.447 --> 39:46.652
Melena has specific clients who
enjoy torture and pain.

39:48.754 --> 39:50.922
You have a choice,

39:50.956 --> 39:52.724
You can get up right now and
smile at the camera,

39:54.993 --> 39:59.465
Or they will make me film Ivan
carving you like roast pig.

40:01.967 --> 40:04.570
Well, what are you going to do?

40:04.603 --> 40:07.473
Ok.

40:07.506 --> 40:08.840
I'll do it.

40:08.874 --> 40:09.875
Ok, ok.

40:16.214 --> 40:18.684
Ok, now I just need you to look
right here,

40:18.717 --> 40:21.720
and see that beautiful smile.

40:26.525 --> 40:28.727
Come on, don't be shy now.
Twirl as well.

40:42.173 --> 40:44.710
Beautiful.

40:44.743 --> 40:46.912
Nice, got it, all done.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.047
Next, Emma, get out here.

40:53.785 --> 40:55.120
Get over there.

40:57.923 --> 41:00.992
Ok, yeah, just stand right here.

41:05.030 --> 41:06.464
Same drill.

41:11.803 --> 41:15.541
- Hi, Dooley.
- Oh, hey Mrs. H, how are you?

41:15.574 --> 41:19.277
Actually, I'm not so good. I'm looking
for Emma, you haven't seen her, have you?

41:19.310 --> 41:20.946
Hi, Lacy.

41:20.979 --> 41:23.615
Katherine Hudson!
I thought you forgot about me.

41:23.649 --> 41:26.618
I don't mean to be rude but I
didn't call to catch up,

41:26.652 --> 41:29.254
I was just wondering, have you
heard from Emma?

41:29.287 --> 41:30.321
Hey, Bobby.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.923
Oh, hey, Kat!
How ar--

41:31.957 --> 41:35.694
I'm not doing so great, listen,

41:35.727 --> 41:37.563
you haven't heard from Emma,
have you?

41:57.583 --> 42:00.085
Emma!
Emma! Hello!

42:00.118 --> 42:02.120
Hello, ma'am, would you
like to lower your monthly payment--

42:02.153 --> 42:03.188
What?

42:03.221 --> 42:05.223
Don't call here again!

42:05.256 --> 42:08.694
- This is a one-time offer.
- Shut up!

42:33.819 --> 42:36.287
Get yourself together.

43:09.721 --> 43:11.657
This is Anna.

43:11.690 --> 43:14.626
Hi Anna, this is Katherine
Hudson, I met you yesterday.

43:14.660 --> 43:16.361
I met a lot of people yesterday.

43:16.394 --> 43:19.297
I was the one taking down
the missing person poster

43:19.330 --> 43:20.732
outside of the construction
site.

43:20.766 --> 43:22.701
Right. Piper's sign.

43:22.734 --> 43:24.903
You going to come in to
volunteer?

43:24.936 --> 43:27.873
Listen, my daughter's gone missing,
and I don't know what to do.

43:32.010 --> 43:33.344
You better come into the office.

43:38.784 --> 43:43.655
Hey, are you awake?

43:43.689 --> 43:44.990
Yeah.

43:46.191 --> 43:47.926
What's your name?

43:47.959 --> 43:49.995
Piper.

43:50.028 --> 43:52.731
You?

43:52.764 --> 43:55.901
I'm Emma.

43:55.934 --> 43:58.403
We have to get out of here.

43:58.436 --> 44:00.772
You can't.

44:00.806 --> 44:02.140
We have to try.

44:03.709 --> 44:04.810
You got a family?

44:06.845 --> 44:10.181
My mom.

44:10.215 --> 44:12.383
Do you love her?

44:12.417 --> 44:15.220
Of course.

44:15.253 --> 44:17.155
If you try to run,

44:17.188 --> 44:18.824
they'll kill her.

44:18.857 --> 44:21.226
No, they're just saying that to
scare us.

44:21.259 --> 44:22.327
They killed a girl last week.

44:25.363 --> 44:28.366
What?

44:28.399 --> 44:30.769
Maddi.

44:30.802 --> 44:34.740
She cut her arm and used the blood
to slip out of her handcuffs.

44:34.773 --> 44:36.975
She made it to the top of the
gate.

44:37.008 --> 44:41.246
Then one of the guards grabbed
her.

44:41.279 --> 44:45.416
She landed bad, broke her leg.

44:45.450 --> 44:51.456
They just left her there,
screaming, until Melena arrived.

44:51.489 --> 44:55.927
Then they brought out these
dogs, pit bulls,

44:55.961 --> 44:59.097
They ripped her apart.

44:59.130 --> 45:02.834
What?

45:02.868 --> 45:04.736
She didn't stop screaming until
she was dead.

45:06.371 --> 45:11.142
But, that makes you guys all
witnesses.

45:11.176 --> 45:15.013
Exactly.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.816
None of us are getting
out of here alive.

45:54.185 --> 45:55.120
- Katherine?
- Yes

45:55.153 --> 45:56.087
Come on in.

46:01.893 --> 46:03.394
Thank you so much for seeing me.

46:03.428 --> 46:04.830
Can I get you a coffee?

46:04.863 --> 46:06.364
No, I'm wired enough as it is,
thank you.

46:06.397 --> 46:07.799
I know, sorry.

46:10.035 --> 46:11.369
Do you have kids?

46:11.402 --> 46:15.273
No, we hold group therapy sessions
here after we rescue the kids.

46:15.306 --> 46:16.774
We try to make it feel like
home.

46:22.247 --> 46:23.381
Here you go.

46:26.017 --> 46:29.020
Ok, look, before we get started,

46:29.054 --> 46:31.189
- I'm got to ask you a couple of questions.
- Ok, sure.

46:32.891 --> 46:34.492
Is there any reason why Emma
would have run away on her own?

46:34.525 --> 46:36.161
No, not that I can think of.

46:36.194 --> 46:38.196
Is there a history of sexual
abuse in your family?

46:38.229 --> 46:40.065
What, you mean me?

46:40.098 --> 46:43.134
- Or your husband, uncle, brother?
- No, absolutely not.

46:43.168 --> 46:44.202
You sure?

46:44.235 --> 46:45.436
Yes, positive.

46:45.470 --> 46:48.273
Ok.

46:48.306 --> 46:51.142
What have the police told you?

46:51.176 --> 46:55.146
They said I should stay home just in
case Emma calls, but I can't do that,

46:55.180 --> 46:58.616
I forwarded my home phone to my
cell,

46:58.649 --> 47:00.485
I'm going out of my mind.

47:04.355 --> 47:06.157
The police won't help you.

47:06.191 --> 47:09.928
It's not a priority to them.

47:09.961 --> 47:14.632
But they said that they were putting Emma's
description out on the NCIC as a runaway.

47:14.665 --> 47:17.869
That's just so they can detain your
daughter if they happen to find her.

47:17.903 --> 47:21.239
It doesn't mean that they're
actively looking.

47:21.272 --> 47:23.441
Look, if you want to find Emma,
you're going to have to do it yourself.

47:27.045 --> 47:29.014
Where do I start?

47:29.047 --> 47:32.650
Alright, the first thing is to
get her up on NCMEC

47:32.683 --> 47:35.453
- What's NCMEC?
- It's the National Center for Missing and Exploited Youth.

47:35.486 --> 47:38.456
I also want you to go to Missingkids.com.
There's a lot of good information.

47:41.692 --> 47:44.129
Will they help us find her?

47:44.162 --> 47:46.264
They might.

47:46.297 --> 47:48.566
But honestly, we have to move
fast.

47:48.599 --> 47:49.935
Most of these girls are moved
and sold

47:49.968 --> 47:52.971
- within 48 hours.
- Wait, what? Sold? What are you talking about?

47:54.672 --> 47:58.076
Has Emma met anyone recently?
A new boyfriend?

47:58.109 --> 48:01.146
Yes, Adam. He's the boy that
we were fighting about.

48:01.179 --> 48:03.281
It's called the Romeo trap.

48:03.314 --> 48:06.384
Traffickers lure young girls by
showering them with attention,

48:06.417 --> 48:08.619
telling them they love them,

48:08.653 --> 48:10.021
gaining their trust, and then
the girls are never seen again.

48:13.524 --> 48:16.394
California is the largest hub for
sex trafficking in North America.

48:28.273 --> 48:29.640
Girls are quiet.

48:29.674 --> 48:31.609
Yeah, I had Mike put something
in their milk.

48:31.642 --> 48:34.279
They'll be out until tomorrow
morning.

48:34.312 --> 48:36.281
How'd the photo shoot go?

48:36.314 --> 48:38.283
I'm just editing the video for
the syndicate now.

48:38.316 --> 48:40.318
What about the stills?

48:40.351 --> 48:42.387
Got them posted on Craigslist
and Backpage

48:42.420 --> 48:45.223
under town gigs, show biz, and
auditions.

48:45.256 --> 48:48.726
Dates are coming in to the hotel
tomorrow.

48:48.759 --> 48:51.296
Save the virgins for the syndicate
because they're paying top dollar.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.331
You got it.

48:53.364 --> 48:56.434
How's your boy Adam holding up?

48:56.467 --> 48:57.435
He's good.

48:57.468 --> 48:59.470
He's ready to come into the
outfit full time.

48:59.504 --> 49:00.972
You can vouch for him?

49:01.006 --> 49:03.708
Of course, we grew up together.

49:03.741 --> 49:07.478
Because Mike said that he looked a little
freaked out when he brought the new girl in.

49:07.512 --> 49:11.716
The first girl is always the
hardest, don't you remember?

49:11.749 --> 49:17.188
Alright, bring him in, but if he screws
up, it's on you, it's your responsibility.

49:17.222 --> 49:19.290
Thank you, Melena.
You won't regret this.

49:21.226 --> 49:22.460
I hope not.

49:36.241 --> 49:39.377
- Over here, you ever heard of Backpage?
- No.

49:39.410 --> 49:40.611
What about Craigslist?

49:40.645 --> 49:42.647
Sure, where you sell stuff.

49:42.680 --> 49:44.349
Yeah, like girls and boys.

49:47.285 --> 49:51.122
How can it be out in the open?
Selling kids, it's illegal.

49:51.156 --> 49:55.193
It is. That's why the victims
are listed as talent.

49:55.226 --> 49:57.795
The perverts that go to these
listings call themselves hobbyists.

49:57.828 --> 49:59.764
But really, they're Johns.

49:59.797 --> 50:02.633
The traffickers have different codes
describing what the girls will do.

50:05.336 --> 50:07.272
I don't understand this.

50:07.305 --> 50:10.075
Ok, Desire, her professional
name.

50:10.108 --> 50:11.309
She's claiming to be 18.

50:11.342 --> 50:12.610
Claiming?

50:12.643 --> 50:15.113
She's probably 16.

50:15.146 --> 50:18.316
GFE refers to the Girlfriend
Experience,

50:18.349 --> 50:19.550
means she's going to be sweet
and loving.

50:19.584 --> 50:21.252
Oh, my God.

50:21.286 --> 50:24.755
And 150 roses means she costs
150 dollars.

50:24.789 --> 50:27.725
So, she's a prostitute?

50:27.758 --> 50:30.161
Prostitutes have a choice.

50:30.195 --> 50:32.163
Nine times out of ten, these
girls don't.

50:32.197 --> 50:33.798
They're sex slaves.

50:33.831 --> 50:37.168
- Why don't the police--
- Do anything?

50:37.202 --> 50:41.239
The cops don't see these children as the
victims, they see them as the criminals.

50:41.272 --> 50:42.740
So when they bust one of these
child brothels,

50:42.773 --> 50:44.375
they don't take
the girls to the hospital,

50:44.409 --> 50:47.145
They take them to jail.

50:47.178 --> 50:49.614
90 percent of the girls in juvenal
hall are there for prostitution.

50:49.647 --> 50:51.149
That is so sick.

50:51.182 --> 50:55.453
Yeah, and that's after they've been
forced to have sex up to 15 times a day.

50:59.857 --> 51:02.660
Is this going to happen to Emma?

51:02.693 --> 51:04.262
We don't know that yet.

51:04.295 --> 51:06.464
Well,

51:06.497 --> 51:08.499
this...

51:08.533 --> 51:11.736
What about TV, can't we put her
photo on the news?

51:11.769 --> 51:14.139
It's not a news story just yet.

51:14.172 --> 51:16.741
Not until we have hard evidence
that she's been abducted.

51:16.774 --> 51:20.611
Well, what can I do? Because I
have to do something.

51:20.645 --> 51:22.347
I am going to help you.

51:22.380 --> 51:26.384
We are going to find Emma, ok?
We're going to work together.

51:26.417 --> 51:30.755
We're going to check her phone records,
social media, Snapchat, Facebook...

51:30.788 --> 51:32.257
We'll get the word out.

51:45.303 --> 51:47.305
- Hi, my daughter is missing.
- Missing person.

51:47.338 --> 51:50.508
If you see her, call me.

51:50.541 --> 51:53.744
Hi, this is my daughter,
she's missing.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.147
Will you pass this around?

52:07.825 --> 52:10.828
Hi, excuse me, can I leave you
with a couple of these?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.330
My daughter's missing.

52:12.363 --> 52:13.564
Excuse me, ma'am.

52:13.598 --> 52:15.666
Ma'am, you don't have permission
to do that on mall property.

52:15.700 --> 52:17.335
My daughter's missing.

52:17.368 --> 52:20.238
I'm sorry to hear that, but you can't just
be handing out missing person's posters.

52:20.271 --> 52:21.639
You're disturbing our customers
in the mall.

52:21.672 --> 52:23.541
This was the last place her
daughter was seen.

52:23.574 --> 52:25.176
Have you contacted the police?

52:25.210 --> 52:26.377
Of course we have.

52:26.411 --> 52:27.212
Well then you should let them
handle it.

52:27.245 --> 52:29.547
They're not doing anything about
it.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.349
I'm sorry to hear that ma'am but
like I said--

52:31.382 --> 52:33.418
What if this was your daughter?

52:33.451 --> 52:35.220
Excuse me?

52:35.253 --> 52:38.423
What if your daughter was
missing?

52:38.456 --> 52:39.757
Look, I know your concerned--

52:39.790 --> 52:42.360
No, you don't know anything
about me!

52:42.393 --> 52:45.763
Look, she found her daughter's cell
phone in one of your dumpsters.

52:48.233 --> 52:50.968
Listen, families come to our
mall to shop,

52:51.001 --> 52:53.838
kids come here to hang out,
it's a safe place.

52:53.871 --> 52:55.873
It is.

52:55.906 --> 52:57.675
Now once in a blue moon a kid
goes missing

52:57.708 --> 52:59.677
and understandably, parents get
very upset,

52:59.710 --> 53:01.946
But every time that's happened,

53:01.979 --> 53:05.516
turns out that the kid went home with a friend
and forgot to check in with their parents.

53:05.550 --> 53:08.219
Ma'am, I want to help you,

53:08.253 --> 53:09.354
but this is a safe area,

53:09.387 --> 53:12.323
Kids don't just disappear.

53:12.357 --> 53:14.925
How long do you keep your
security footage backed up?

53:14.959 --> 53:16.927
30 days, standard procedure.

53:16.961 --> 53:18.929
Have the police reviewed it?

53:18.963 --> 53:20.331
No, they haven't asked to.

53:20.365 --> 53:21.966
It might show us what happened
to Emma.

53:21.999 --> 53:23.701
That's against corporate policy,
I can't.

53:23.734 --> 53:24.869
You said you wanted to help.

53:24.902 --> 53:27.638
I do, but my hands are tied
here.

53:27.672 --> 53:30.375
If Emma's not on that tape that
means that she wasn't here.

53:30.408 --> 53:31.442
Then we can go and look some
place else,

53:31.476 --> 53:34.312
and maybe find her, please!

53:34.345 --> 53:35.646
This is my daughter!

53:35.680 --> 53:37.782
Please, I'm begging you.

53:40.751 --> 53:43.288
Ok.

53:43.321 --> 53:44.489
Ok, let's go take a look.

53:44.522 --> 53:45.923
Follow me.

53:48.058 --> 53:51.529
Bobby, give us the room.
Take a break.

53:51.562 --> 53:53.764
Thanks.

53:53.798 --> 53:56.767
Ok, so all the security footage
is stored here.

53:56.801 --> 54:00.605
She would have been here yesterday
around 10:12, something like that.

54:00.638 --> 54:03.841
Ok.

54:03.874 --> 54:05.943
This is ten o'clock. I'll scan
through it double-speed.

54:12.383 --> 54:14.018
Wait, wait, can you go back a
couple seconds?

54:17.355 --> 54:20.458
Oh, my God, there she is!

54:20.491 --> 54:22.360
Ok,

54:22.393 --> 54:23.761
I should be able to track
her from camera to camera.

54:31.769 --> 54:33.838
Ok, keep going.

54:33.871 --> 54:34.872
There she is.

54:41.912 --> 54:44.815
That's Adam, the boy that she
was with.

54:44.849 --> 54:45.750
They're there.

54:55.125 --> 54:57.462
Oh, my God, what
happened to her?

54:57.495 --> 54:58.863
I think he drugged her.

54:58.896 --> 55:00.698
Where did she go? Where is she?

55:00.731 --> 55:02.533
That's the maintenance corridor,
we don't have any cameras in there.

55:02.567 --> 55:03.768
What about the parking lot?

55:03.801 --> 55:04.769
Those cameras are for loss
prevention,

55:04.802 --> 55:05.870
We don't have any on the lot.

55:05.903 --> 55:07.572
We have to go check out that
corridor.

55:07.605 --> 55:10.808
I need you to call the police, ask for
detective Cordova and tell her what we saw.

55:10.841 --> 55:13.378
Cordova, you got it.

55:17.982 --> 55:19.784
It's just up ahead.

55:25.890 --> 55:28.926
Oh my god, that's him,
that's Adam.

55:28.959 --> 55:32.096
Ok, no, hold up, Katherine.
Be smart.

55:32.129 --> 55:34.599
Ok, let's follow him and see
where he takes us.

56:12.703 --> 56:14.472
When he gets in his car, we're
going to lose him.

56:14.505 --> 56:17.141
Take it easy, you follow him on
foot, I'll go get your car.

56:59.183 --> 57:00.785
Go, come on!

57:07.257 --> 57:08.358
He's getting away!

57:08.392 --> 57:10.961
Katherine, its ok, I don't
want to get too close.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.569
You've got to get closer.

57:19.904 --> 57:20.938
I don't want to lose
him at the light.

57:20.971 --> 57:22.206
Yeah, I'm on it.

57:58.576 --> 57:59.844
Sit, hold tight.

58:02.246 --> 58:03.280
Katherine!

58:03.313 --> 58:04.749
Katherine get back here.

58:07.885 --> 58:09.253
The movie's called agave,

58:09.286 --> 58:12.990
it's a documentary about the
origins of tequila.

58:13.023 --> 58:14.024
There he is.

58:17.662 --> 58:18.796
Hey!

58:18.829 --> 58:19.897
Wow, wow...

58:19.930 --> 58:21.566
You're Adam, right?

58:21.599 --> 58:23.233
Who wants to know?

58:23.267 --> 58:25.570
I'm Emma's mother.

58:25.603 --> 58:27.071
I don't know what you're talking
about.

58:27.104 --> 58:29.874
- Emma. Emma Hudson.
- What?

58:29.907 --> 58:31.175
She's my daughter and she's
missing

58:31.208 --> 58:33.077
and we have surveillance footage
of you with her

58:33.110 --> 58:35.813
and I want to know where she is.

58:35.846 --> 58:37.314
Where's my daughter?

58:37.347 --> 58:38.816
You're crazy, lady!

58:38.849 --> 58:40.084
I've never seen that girl
before.

58:40.117 --> 58:41.719
Just get out of here, ok?

58:41.752 --> 58:43.320
- Does that ring a bell?
- Get away from me!

58:43.353 --> 58:45.923
Ok, ok,

58:45.956 --> 58:48.559
If you help me get Emma back and
you will never see me again.

58:48.593 --> 58:50.327
But if you don't, I'm going to
the police.

58:50.360 --> 58:52.763
The police, no, you do not want
to do that!

58:52.797 --> 58:56.834
Tell me where my daughter is or you're
going to die in jail, do you understand me?

58:56.867 --> 59:00.170
Ok, ok, I understand.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.538
Ok.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.810
No! No!

59:07.177 --> 59:08.613
Katherine!

59:24.261 --> 59:25.562
Hey!

59:29.934 --> 59:30.901
- Where is she?
- Get off of me?

59:31.936 --> 59:35.606
Inhaler, I need my inhaler!

59:35.640 --> 59:37.708
This inhaler? This is what you
need?

59:37.742 --> 59:38.743
Yes! I need it.

59:38.776 --> 59:40.611
Then you better tell me
where my daughter is.

59:40.645 --> 59:41.646
Please!

59:41.679 --> 59:42.780
Katherine!

59:42.813 --> 59:43.748
What are you doing?

59:43.781 --> 59:45.650
Inhaler!

59:45.683 --> 59:46.617
Oh, Adam, that doesn't sound
good!

59:46.651 --> 59:47.885
It sounds like your throat is
closing up!

59:47.918 --> 59:50.320
You're going to die if you don't
tell me where my daughter is.

59:50.354 --> 59:51.756
I don't know where she is, I
swear to God.

59:51.789 --> 59:53.791
Where did you see her last?

59:53.824 --> 59:57.762
Yesterday, I delivered her to
Mike's van like I was told.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.196
- What van?
- Give me my inhaler!

59:59.229 --> 01:00:01.131
No!
Who is Mike?

01:00:01.165 --> 01:00:02.800
- I don't know!
- Yes, you do!

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.869
- Give me my inhaler!
- Where can I find Mike?

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:08.939
He works for a moving company,
that's all I know. Please, I can't breathe!

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:11.809
You better call the cops.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:13.410
They're coming.

01:00:23.053 --> 01:00:24.121
Are you ok?

01:00:45.342 --> 01:00:48.078
Oh, my God!

01:00:48.112 --> 01:00:49.379
He's been shot!

01:00:51.181 --> 01:00:53.217
Oh, my God!

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.020
- Melena, Melena.
- What?

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:58.055
What about Melena?

01:00:58.088 --> 01:00:59.089
Who's Melena?

01:00:59.123 --> 01:01:00.825
Mike works for Melena.

01:01:00.858 --> 01:01:04.695
If someone finds your daughter,
talk to Melena.

01:01:06.831 --> 01:01:08.933
No!

01:01:10.935 --> 01:01:13.403
No!

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:21.779
Hey, I need you to get a
delivery truck

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.180
and clear out the warehouse.

01:01:23.213 --> 01:01:24.749
We're moving.

01:01:24.782 --> 01:01:26.751
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:01:26.784 --> 01:01:27.785
We're booked pretty solid
for pink.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:28.853
Want me to cancel?

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:30.354
No, we're good to go.

01:01:30.387 --> 01:01:32.222
- What about Johnny?
- He's going to be fine,

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:34.158
he's probably on a beach
in Mexico somewhere.

01:01:46.103 --> 01:01:48.072
I already gave my statement
to the police.

01:01:48.105 --> 01:01:49.173
Ma'am can we talk to you?

01:01:49.206 --> 01:01:50.474
Fine.

01:01:50.507 --> 01:01:52.977
You could have gotten
yourself killed.

01:01:53.010 --> 01:01:55.079
Well, maybe that would have
gotten your attention.

01:01:55.112 --> 01:01:57.147
You got something to say,
Mrs. Hudson?

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.149
Go ahead, say it.

01:01:59.183 --> 01:02:00.350
Ok.

01:02:00.384 --> 01:02:02.452
My daughter didn't run away
from home.

01:02:02.486 --> 01:02:05.022
She was taken by human
traffickers, kidnapped,

01:02:05.055 --> 01:02:06.757
and you haven't done
a damn thing about it.

01:02:06.791 --> 01:02:08.192
We've put out an APV
for Emma.

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:10.060
We notified the FBI.

01:02:10.094 --> 01:02:11.428
Oh, you notified the FBI, great.

01:02:11.461 --> 01:02:13.898
How long until they sit up
and pay attention?

01:02:13.931 --> 01:02:16.366
My daughter is going to
disappear in 12 hours.

01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.468
Sold as a sex slave.

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:20.337
Do you understand that?

01:02:20.370 --> 01:02:22.973
She's 16 years old. 16!

01:02:23.007 --> 01:02:26.376
So you'll excuse me if I don't feel
like sitting home and being patient,

01:02:26.410 --> 01:02:28.645
I am going to find her with you
or without you.

01:02:32.516 --> 01:02:34.484
Let's start with Craigslist
and Backpage.

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:39.389
Looking for recent postings.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:47.131
Ok, these are from the last
24 hours.

01:02:47.164 --> 01:02:49.900
New talent, just arrived
in town.

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:55.873
No.

01:03:00.010 --> 01:03:01.211
No.

01:03:03.848 --> 01:03:04.982
No.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:07.551
No.

01:03:09.353 --> 01:03:10.354
Next.

01:03:14.591 --> 01:03:16.526
Come on, get in the van.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:21.498
Let's go.

01:03:21.531 --> 01:03:22.532
Come on.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:29.273
Mike!

01:03:32.142 --> 01:03:34.444
No, stop!

01:03:36.914 --> 01:03:38.048
Stop!

01:03:38.082 --> 01:03:39.950
Stop!

01:03:42.052 --> 01:03:43.220
Next.

01:03:43.487 --> 01:03:44.889
No. Next.

01:03:44.922 --> 01:03:46.023
Next.

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:47.557
Next.

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:49.159
Next.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.095
Next.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.463
Next.

01:03:53.497 --> 01:03:54.631
Katherine.

01:03:54.664 --> 01:03:55.565
Click on the next link.

01:03:57.134 --> 01:03:59.169
- Why don't we take a little--
- Click on the next link.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:01.605
Ok.

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:08.512
No.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.014
Wait,

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.348
that's Courtney.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.382
Emma's friend?

01:04:12.416 --> 01:04:13.517
Yes.

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.455
These girls are being worked out
of Sun Valley,

01:04:18.488 --> 01:04:19.890
at the pink motel.

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:20.958
Where's Emma?

01:04:22.559 --> 01:04:24.028
This is the last link
in the group.

01:04:24.061 --> 01:04:26.296
No it can't be the last link.
Where is Emma?

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:29.033
What'd they do with her?

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:31.936
Have they sold her?

01:04:31.969 --> 01:04:35.439
Not necessarily. They could be
saving her for a private buyer.

01:04:35.472 --> 01:04:39.043
But we have Courtney, isn't that enough
evidence to get the cops involved?

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:42.112
An online add is not enough
to get them out there.

01:04:42.146 --> 01:04:43.413
We still need hard evidence.

01:04:49.086 --> 01:04:51.255
What if I pretend to buy her
for an hour?

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:54.391
Courtney?

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.294
Yes, what if I pretend to be
one of these perverts?

01:04:57.327 --> 01:04:58.528
That is not going to work.

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:01.398
Why? They have female clients,
right?

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:02.532
I've never heard of that?

01:05:02.566 --> 01:05:05.302
Anna, you keep telling me that
I'm running out of time.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:07.037
And I don't know what else
to do,

01:05:07.071 --> 01:05:10.274
so if I don't talk to Courtney,
then I might not see Emma again,

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:13.543
so please, get me a time slot
with Courtney.

01:05:22.352 --> 01:05:24.121
Done.

01:05:24.154 --> 01:05:26.090
Appointment number 58.

01:05:29.126 --> 01:05:30.694
You got an hour to get over
there.

01:06:09.099 --> 01:06:10.167
Hey.

01:06:12.036 --> 01:06:14.538
If they catch you,
they will kill you.

01:06:14.571 --> 01:06:16.473
I don't care about my life.

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:19.609
They'll kill Emma, too.

01:06:19.643 --> 01:06:21.278
Well, do you think Emma wants
to live like this,

01:06:21.311 --> 01:06:22.679
do you think she
wants to be a sex slave?

01:06:26.283 --> 01:06:31.655
Of course not.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.323
This happened to you, didn't it?

01:06:40.197 --> 01:06:42.232
I ran away from home
when I was 14

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:48.338
I lived on the streets for a
while before they picked me up.

01:06:48.372 --> 01:06:51.007
They put me in a warehouse
in Texas.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.512
They starved us,

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:58.215
beat us,

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.584
and then they raped us.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:11.528
We were shipped out in passenger
vans to motels,

01:07:11.561 --> 01:07:14.298
or camps, truck
stops, where ever.

01:07:17.401 --> 01:07:19.569
We were forced to have sex with
so many men every night.

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:22.606
Every night.

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:25.709
I stopped counting.

01:07:32.116 --> 01:07:34.618
One night I was taken
to a truck stop.

01:07:34.651 --> 01:07:36.120
Forced in the back.

01:07:39.189 --> 01:07:40.424
I saw a screwdriver.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:45.395
And when the bastard turned me
around I stabbed him in the eye.

01:07:47.164 --> 01:07:48.598
I turned myself in.

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.836
The DA knocked in down to
self-defence,

01:07:54.271 --> 01:07:56.206
And I did four years for
manslaughter.

01:07:59.743 --> 01:08:05.715
Ten years later, 1,500 miles away I
still wake up screaming every day.

01:08:13.457 --> 01:08:17.594
The only thing that makes it
better is to help victims,

01:08:17.627 --> 01:08:20.630
So I will help you, I will do
whatever it takes.

01:08:24.533 --> 01:08:26.136
Here.

01:08:28.238 --> 01:08:30.540
- Take this
- I already have a phone.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.276
When you go in there,
they'll search you

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.544
and take away
any electronic devices.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:37.346
Put your real phone somewhere
they won't find it.

01:08:39.916 --> 01:08:41.484
If Emma is in there,

01:08:41.518 --> 01:08:44.421
they are not going to let her
go without a fight.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:47.424
To them, she is serious money.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.859
It could get really ugly,
really fast.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:53.197
If I'm not out in 30 minutes,
call the cops.

01:09:14.684 --> 01:09:16.685
This is private property.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:17.854
I have a date.

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.622
You here for the boy?

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:21.225
I don't like boys.

01:09:21.258 --> 01:09:23.193
I have an appointment,
I'm number 58.

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:26.595
You're late.

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:27.731
Traffic.

01:09:28.698 --> 01:09:29.599
Are you a cop?

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:32.868
You a cop?

01:09:34.770 --> 01:09:36.773
One-fifty for 30 minutes.

01:09:45.448 --> 01:09:47.850
Hands up, I got to search you.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.831
No electronics,
you should know that.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.733
I'm going to need that phone
back afterwards.

01:10:03.767 --> 01:10:04.768
Alright.

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:10.640
Room number six.

01:10:10.674 --> 01:10:12.542
Knock yourself out.

01:10:27.391 --> 01:10:28.792
I'll take it.

01:10:32.296 --> 01:10:34.298
Room six. Down the end.

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.425
Courtney!

01:11:02.459 --> 01:11:03.627
Courtney!

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.594
Courtney!

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:25.815
Courtney, it's Katherine.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:28.385
Emma's mom.

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:30.086
- Mrs. Hudson.
- Yes.

01:11:30.119 --> 01:11:32.489
Yes, I want to get your out
of here.

01:11:32.522 --> 01:11:34.624
But I need to know
where is Emma?

01:11:34.658 --> 01:11:36.360
What?

01:11:36.393 --> 01:11:39.095
Where is Emma?

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:42.599
They took three of the other
girls an hour ago.

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.901
Where did they take them?

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:46.903
I don't know.

01:11:46.936 --> 01:11:49.673
Can I go home now?

01:11:49.706 --> 01:11:51.608
I just want to go home

01:11:51.641 --> 01:11:53.577
Yes, I'm going
to take you home, honey.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.645
Just...

01:11:55.679 --> 01:11:58.848
I got to figure out how
to do that.

01:12:14.698 --> 01:12:15.899
Let's get your dressed.

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:18.502
Cordova.

01:12:18.535 --> 01:12:19.836
It's Anna from Saving Innocents.

01:12:19.869 --> 01:12:20.904
What do you need?

01:12:20.937 --> 01:12:22.839
I am sitting outside of Pink
Motel in Sun Valley,

01:12:22.872 --> 01:12:24.974
There are multiple human
trafficking victims on site.

01:12:26.943 --> 01:12:28.077
You got any evidence?

01:12:28.111 --> 01:12:30.747
I am texting you photos of one
of the girls right now.

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:32.882
Courtney Halliday, missing
for 48 hours.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:34.050
How'd you get the photo?

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.886
Katherine Hudson,
Emma's mother,

01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:38.087
She is inside with them right
now.

01:12:48.598 --> 01:12:49.666
How we doing?

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.667
Full house.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.936
We got to check the new girls
Facebook page,

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:54.904
We got her mother sniffing
around.

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.039
How do you know?

01:12:56.072 --> 01:12:57.707
Our friend on the force just
called me.

01:12:57.741 --> 01:12:59.008
And...

01:12:59.042 --> 01:13:01.511
They're calling in the FBI, we
need to get out of the country.

01:13:14.924 --> 01:13:17.126
Ok, let's go.
Come on.

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:21.030
No, no. get up.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.969
Up, up.

01:13:35.011 --> 01:13:36.913
You can do this, come on.
We are almost there.

01:13:36.946 --> 01:13:38.181
We can do this, stay on your
feet, come one,

01:13:38.214 --> 01:13:39.649
We gotta go.

01:13:39.683 --> 01:13:40.684
Where do you think you're going?

01:13:43.152 --> 01:13:44.554
I am...

01:13:45.221 --> 01:13:46.189
I like her,

01:13:46.222 --> 01:13:47.524
I want to buy her.

01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:49.092
You want to buy her?

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.760
I don't think so.

01:13:50.794 --> 01:13:52.696
Listen, I'll give you $10,000
for her right now.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:54.898
Just let us go.

01:13:54.931 --> 01:13:57.767
That's a sweet offer, but I
don't think you want to buy her.

01:13:57.801 --> 01:13:59.936
I think you're looking
for your daughter.

01:13:59.969 --> 01:14:01.838
I don't have a daughter.

01:14:03.239 --> 01:14:05.074
We looked up Emma's
Facebook page,

01:14:05.108 --> 01:14:06.543
and guess what?

01:14:06.576 --> 01:14:08.478
You're photos came right up.

01:14:08.512 --> 01:14:09.846
I don't know what you're talking
about.

01:14:09.879 --> 01:14:11.180
Really.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:12.749
We'll see about that.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:15.184
Turn around. Go back
to the motel.

01:14:15.218 --> 01:14:16.520
Come on.

01:15:23.086 --> 01:15:25.254
Good, you're awake.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:26.656
Where's my daughter?

01:15:26.690 --> 01:15:27.791
So you do have a daughter?

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:29.759
I'm glad we're finally being
honest with each other.

01:15:29.793 --> 01:15:31.194
Where is she?

01:15:31.227 --> 01:15:32.696
Bring her in.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:34.063
Ivan.

01:15:35.865 --> 01:15:37.901
Mom!

01:15:37.934 --> 01:15:39.202
It's going to be ok!

01:15:41.137 --> 01:15:42.271
Baby, it's going to be ok.

01:15:42.305 --> 01:15:43.607
Mommy, no!

01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:44.874
It's not going to be ok.

01:15:45.875 --> 01:15:48.311
Get her out of here.

01:15:48.344 --> 01:15:50.814
No, please!
Just bring her back to me!

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:52.315
It's too late.

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:54.050
I'll pay you whatever you want!

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:55.719
I'll sell my house.

01:15:55.752 --> 01:15:58.755
We've already sold her to the
syndicate.

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:02.158
They need lots of girls for their
brothels and it's a big turnover.

01:16:02.191 --> 01:16:03.727
But she's a child.

01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.195
I have hundreds and hundreds
of children.

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.832
That's what makes this such a
great business for me, Katherine.

01:16:08.865 --> 01:16:12.902
I can sell them again,
and again, and again.

01:16:12.936 --> 01:16:13.937
How can you do this?

01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:16.072
I don't care about the kids.

01:16:16.105 --> 01:16:17.641
They mean nothing to me.

01:16:17.674 --> 01:16:24.047
It's just the money.
They're money machines.

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:29.052
I was sold to the syndicate by
my own mother when I was 13.

01:16:29.085 --> 01:16:35.058
Paid my dues between the sheets and
it didn't break me, it made me strong.

01:16:35.091 --> 01:16:39.696
I started recruiting when I was 18, and by
the time I was 20 I was running the girls.

01:16:39.729 --> 01:16:43.767
And now I have my own crew

01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:48.037
and nobody tells me what to do,
I do what I want, when I want.

01:16:48.071 --> 01:16:52.341
And what I really want is money.

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:55.344
And lucky for me...

01:16:55.378 --> 01:16:59.015
...you raised Emma to be
such a good little girl.

01:16:59.048 --> 01:17:03.052
Which is good because the syndicate,
they pay premium cash for virgins.

01:17:03.086 --> 01:17:07.791
Please, you let her go,
you take me.

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:09.693
I don't want you.

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:14.263
I want you to tell me what
you told the police.

01:17:14.297 --> 01:17:16.165
That's what I want to know.

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:17.200
I haven't talked to the police.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:21.137
Oh come on. You and I both know
that is a lie.

01:17:21.170 --> 01:17:23.439
But Ivan, he has a way of making
people talk.

01:17:23.472 --> 01:17:25.308
- Ivan!

01:17:25.341 --> 01:17:27.711
No, no! No, please, no!

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:30.179
No, no! No, don't!
No, please!

01:17:30.213 --> 01:17:31.414
No, no!

01:17:31.447 --> 01:17:34.884
No, please no. No. Please.

01:17:34.918 --> 01:17:36.853
We could make this all go away,
Catherine,

01:17:36.886 --> 01:17:38.955
if you just tell me
what you told the police.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:45.328
I swear on my life that I didn't
talk to the police.

01:17:45.361 --> 01:17:46.395
Again.

01:17:50.734 --> 01:17:52.836
That's enough!

01:17:52.869 --> 01:17:56.372
You know, the syndicate,

01:17:56.405 --> 01:17:58.441
they don't really like us to
touch the face and the hands.

01:17:58.474 --> 01:18:01.177
But they do still pay
if we cut off the toes.

01:18:01.210 --> 01:18:04.848
And I really
don't wanna do that to Emma.

01:18:04.881 --> 01:18:06.816
So why don't you tell me what
you told the police?

01:18:06.850 --> 01:18:11.120
Please, don't hurt her.
Please.

01:18:11.154 --> 01:18:14.457
Well then, why don't you
tell me?

01:18:14.490 --> 01:18:19.095
She's got ten toes, Catherine.
We could be here all day.

01:18:19.128 --> 01:18:22.866
Or we could make this really
easy, and you could tell me now.

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:26.803
I didn't tell them anything!

01:18:26.836 --> 01:18:29.072
Why are you doing this
to your daughter?

01:18:31.474 --> 01:18:33.309
Again.

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:35.411
You listen to me.

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:37.847
If you don't
let her go, I will kill you.

01:18:37.881 --> 01:18:40.116
I will. You bitch!

01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:43.219
I am a bitch.

01:18:43.252 --> 01:18:46.422
And you remember that, because next
time it's not gonna be her toes.

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:48.958
It's gonna be her head.

01:18:48.992 --> 01:18:50.860
You understand me?

01:18:53.129 --> 01:18:54.430
Do you understand me?

01:19:01.337 --> 01:19:04.107
Yeah?

01:19:04.140 --> 01:19:06.142
Let 'em in.

01:19:08.845 --> 01:19:10.446
It's the syndicate.

01:19:12.982 --> 01:19:14.083
What do you want me to do
with her?

01:19:14.117 --> 01:19:15.785
I don't care. She doesn't know
anything.

01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:17.186
She hasn't talked
to the police.

01:19:19.188 --> 01:19:22.859
Do whatever you want,
just keep her alive.

01:19:22.892 --> 01:19:25.094
I've got a good sale for her
liver and her heart.

01:19:25.128 --> 01:19:27.530
The surgical team are
on their way over.

01:19:48.351 --> 01:19:50.887
End of the road for you, momma.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:53.823
Doctor's gonna cut you open
and sell you for parts.

01:19:55.491 --> 01:19:57.460
That's what we do with the girls
when they're all used up.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:13.042
Not bad.

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:17.847
We're gonna have to make this
a quickie.

01:20:27.190 --> 01:20:29.025
This doesn't have to be a bad
thing for you, momma.

01:20:34.230 --> 01:20:35.999
Wait.

01:20:36.032 --> 01:20:37.833
You might actually enjoy this.

01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:42.271
No, wait, wait! Wait, wait!
Wait, wait.

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:43.472
Wait for what?

01:20:43.506 --> 01:20:44.573
Yeah, I'll do it.

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:49.145
But not like this.
Please.

01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.149
Kiss me first.

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:54.517
You want me to kiss you?

01:20:58.421 --> 01:20:59.855
Please.

01:21:19.342 --> 01:21:21.377
Get off me!

01:21:27.116 --> 01:21:28.251
Where did they take her?

01:21:38.361 --> 01:21:40.329
She's in here.

01:21:40.363 --> 01:21:41.998
Open the door.

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.443
Don't move.

01:22:16.065 --> 01:22:17.066
Where is she?

01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.167
Please.

01:22:18.201 --> 01:22:20.103
Mom!

01:22:23.472 --> 01:22:26.042
I'll be back for you.
I promise.

01:22:28.777 --> 01:22:29.979
Emma!

01:22:30.013 --> 01:22:31.314
Mom!

01:22:31.347 --> 01:22:33.082
It's okay, Emma.
Mommy's here now.

01:22:33.116 --> 01:22:34.250
Put the gun down!

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:35.684
- Don't do it, Mom!
- Shut up!

01:22:35.718 --> 01:22:38.421
You let her go right now,
or I will shoot you.

01:22:38.454 --> 01:22:40.656
You that good of a shot,
Catherine? Because if you miss,

01:22:40.689 --> 01:22:42.625
you might kill your daughter.

01:22:45.094 --> 01:22:47.430
You let Emma go and you can
still get out of here.

01:22:53.036 --> 01:22:56.405
You think you can come here
and mess with me?

01:22:56.439 --> 01:22:58.241
Please, I just want
my daughter back.

01:22:58.274 --> 01:22:59.442
I will do anything.

01:22:59.475 --> 01:23:01.410
You're gonna die, Catherine.

01:23:01.444 --> 01:23:03.412
And before you do,
I want you to know

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:06.215
that I'm not gonna sell your
daughter to the syndicate after all.

01:23:06.249 --> 01:23:08.051
I'm gonna keep her.

01:23:08.084 --> 01:23:12.221
And I'm gonna sell her ass
everywhere I go.

01:23:12.255 --> 01:23:15.391
I'm not talking about
the classy places.

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:19.262
I'm talking about the worst
of the worst.

01:23:19.295 --> 01:23:24.233
Truck stops, crack dens,
work camps.

01:23:24.267 --> 01:23:26.069
The places that perverts go

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:28.271
and pay extra money
to inflict pain.

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:32.241
She's gonna be wishing that
I let her die,

01:23:32.275 --> 01:23:34.343
but I'm not gonna
let her.

01:23:34.377 --> 01:23:37.213
I'm gonna keep her alive.

01:23:37.246 --> 01:23:39.748
And when she asks me why,

01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:41.350
I'm gonna tell her,

01:23:41.384 --> 01:23:43.786
it's because her mother's
a stupid whore.

01:23:43.819 --> 01:23:45.254
No! Please!

01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:43.179
Mom!

01:24:45.381 --> 01:24:48.817
I love you, Mom!
