00:09.009 --> 00:10.720
[sirens wailing]

00:10.803 --> 00:12.804
[growling]

00:16.766 --> 00:18.643
[loud thud]

00:20.146 --> 00:21.896
Ladies and gentleman,

00:21.981 --> 00:25.317
please welcome to the stage...

00:25.400 --> 00:28.236
the latest, and might I say,

00:28.320 --> 00:30.905
greatest, addition to the Vought

00:30.989 --> 00:32.365
crime-fighting family...

00:32.450 --> 00:34.868
The Homelander!

00:34.951 --> 00:37.287
- [cheers, applause]
- [Madelyn] Not since
Soldier Boy

00:37.371 --> 00:40.207
has Vought been
so excited to work

00:40.290 --> 00:44.253
with a superhero of
The Homelander's caliber.

00:44.335 --> 00:47.381
[camera shutters clicking]

00:47.465 --> 00:51.218
Hello, friends.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.594
[reporter] The Homelander,
what made you decide

00:52.677 --> 00:53.845
to join up with Vought?

00:53.929 --> 00:55.639
[camera shutters clicking]

00:55.722 --> 00:58.350
I, uh... Um...

00:59.560 --> 01:01.186
[crowd murmuring]

01:01.270 --> 01:03.146
[high-pitched ringing]

01:08.778 --> 01:12.239
Say, you guys ever hear
of the Whitehall Tigers?

01:12.323 --> 01:14.742
What? No?
Ah, that's okay.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.993
That was my team back as a kid.

01:17.076 --> 01:19.704
Back then, I only wanted
to do two things,

01:19.789 --> 01:22.500
play baseball and play baseball.

01:22.582 --> 01:23.834
[heavy breathing]

01:23.918 --> 01:25.628
[Homelander] Every night
on the farm,

01:25.710 --> 01:28.046
playing catch with my dad,
I'd dream of the big leagues.

01:28.129 --> 01:30.174
Hitting a homer
at Yankee Stadium.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.674
Heck, I would've settled

01:31.759 --> 01:33.676
for just warming the bench
at Yankee Stadium.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.554
- [crowd laughing]
- [screaming]

01:35.638 --> 01:39.224
What I'm saying is, my baseball
career didn't exactly work out,

01:39.307 --> 01:43.603
but Vought? Well, Vought is the
big leagues for someone like me.

01:43.686 --> 01:45.063
A chance to use my gifts

01:45.146 --> 01:47.149
to help make the world
a better place.

01:47.233 --> 01:48.817
- [applause]
- New York's a lot rougher

01:48.901 --> 01:51.069
than a Whitehall
baseball diamond.

01:51.152 --> 01:52.987
How are you getting ready
for everything

01:53.072 --> 01:54.781
this city can throw at you?

01:54.865 --> 01:56.366
- [Homelander] Great question.
- [screams]

01:56.450 --> 01:58.076
Vought's teamed me up
with someone I've idolized

01:58.159 --> 01:59.078
my entire life.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.664
My friend and yours,

02:01.746 --> 02:03.540
- Black Noir.
- [triumphant music playing]

02:03.623 --> 02:05.417
[cheers, applause]

02:05.501 --> 02:06.960
[camera shutters clicking]

02:15.468 --> 02:17.805
[music distorting]

02:24.603 --> 02:27.355
This was supposed to be
your big debut.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.108
Your big moment.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.776
And he puts Noir
up there with you?

02:30.860 --> 02:33.945
You should be fucking upset
about this.

02:34.028 --> 02:35.948
If Mr. Edgar believes
Black Noir can teach me...

02:36.031 --> 02:38.283
Noir is not there to teach you.

02:38.366 --> 02:40.493
He is there to watch you.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.037
Make sure you follow the script.

02:42.121 --> 02:45.123
Make sure you don't screw up
and embarrass the company.

02:45.206 --> 02:48.543
And bring you in if you do.

02:48.627 --> 02:50.962
And do you think Noir wants you

02:51.045 --> 02:53.340
in his number one spot?

02:53.424 --> 02:56.009
Not likely.

02:56.093 --> 02:58.137
Being on stage--

02:58.219 --> 03:01.431
all those people
who wanted to be you,

03:01.514 --> 03:04.643
or be with you, or fuck you--

03:04.727 --> 03:06.312
it felt good, right?

03:06.395 --> 03:07.812
Yes.

03:07.896 --> 03:11.483
That's the future
I'm building for you,

03:11.567 --> 03:13.860
but you need to take it.

03:13.943 --> 03:17.406
Don't let some murderous,
mute psycho get in your way.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.121
We should drop the "The."

03:24.204 --> 03:26.581
Just "Homelander" is better.

03:36.966 --> 03:38.509
â™ª â™ª

03:38.593 --> 03:39.887
[TV reporter] The group,
calling themselves

03:39.969 --> 03:41.764
the Chemical Liberation Front,

03:41.847 --> 03:43.223
have taken eight hostages

03:43.307 --> 03:45.643
at the Cruz Chemical plant
on Staten Island.

03:45.725 --> 03:47.561
The hostages are said to all be

03:47.645 --> 03:49.896
Cruz Chemical managers
and executives.

03:49.979 --> 03:52.566
The CLF also released
this footage an hour ago.

03:52.650 --> 03:56.194
We didn't want to do this,
but Cruz left us no choice.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.531
Their toxic poisons
drift into our schools,

03:59.615 --> 04:02.742
our parks, our homes,
and cause this.

04:02.825 --> 04:04.828
Until they close this
fucking cancer factory,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.747
we're not fucking
going anywhere!

04:06.830 --> 04:07.997
[Homelander] I'm here.

04:08.081 --> 04:08.998
[handler] Hold position.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.250
Black Noir on route.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.086
ETA 14 minutes.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.004
[Madelyn] Don't let some
murderous, mute psycho

04:15.088 --> 04:16.882
get in your way.

04:16.966 --> 04:18.841
These hostages
don't have 14 minutes.

04:18.925 --> 04:19.843
I'm going in.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.720
[handler] Wait, Homelan...

04:31.396 --> 04:32.898
- [Homelander] Excuse me, ma'am.
- [gasps]

04:32.981 --> 04:34.441
- [loud punch]
- [grunts]

04:34.524 --> 04:36.317
[shaky breaking]

04:37.403 --> 04:38.903
I'm sorry, but you'll
need to stay here

04:38.987 --> 04:40.697
- until the authorities arrive.
- Ah!

04:40.781 --> 04:43.742
- Ow! I can't breathe.
- You'll be fine.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.411
You wrapped a metal pipe
around my chest.

04:46.495 --> 04:48.538
What the hell
is wrong with you?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.415
Ted! Ted, help!

04:50.499 --> 04:51.834
- Liz? You okay?
- [Liz] Help me!

04:51.917 --> 04:54.420
[grunts, groans] Fuck!

04:54.502 --> 04:57.338
[groans] Oh, God,
you broke my fucking nose.

04:57.423 --> 05:00.091
And you, I'm afraid,
broke the law, Mister.

05:00.175 --> 05:02.136
Ah, fuck you.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.512
Clown-suited piece of shit.

05:04.596 --> 05:07.057
[CLF leader over radio] Ted?
Can you check on Liz?

05:07.141 --> 05:09.685
She's not answering. Ted?

05:09.768 --> 05:11.019
[whimpers]

05:11.103 --> 05:13.062
Fuck! That means someone's here.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.398
We got to get fucking ready.

05:14.480 --> 05:16.149
[gasps] I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.569
- I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.
- Shit. Okay. Here we go.

05:18.651 --> 05:20.237
Please, we just work here.

05:20.319 --> 05:22.406
We don't make any decisions.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.322
- [door opens]
- [gasps]

05:23.406 --> 05:25.408
[lasers blasting]

05:26.617 --> 05:29.997
[coughing]

05:35.293 --> 05:37.086
My name's The...

05:37.170 --> 05:38.297
My name's Homelander.

05:38.379 --> 05:40.048
And I'm not here to hurt anyone.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.050
Don't come any closer.
We'll kill them.

05:42.134 --> 05:44.470
Whoa, ho, ho, ho. Easy, friend.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.971
I understand you're angry,
but this...

05:47.055 --> 05:49.932
this violence is no way
to effect change.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.603
So put your guns down
and let's talk.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.103
Just stay back. I'm warning you.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.105
Fuck you, you facist fuck!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.024
- [gunfire]
- [screaming]

06:01.278 --> 06:02.779
[gasps]

06:03.906 --> 06:05.115
[grunts]

06:05.199 --> 06:07.283
Violence is never the answer.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.911
Now, if you come peacefully,

06:08.994 --> 06:10.620
I'll make sure your cause

06:10.704 --> 06:12.081
is discussed
at the highest level.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.500
If you don't get the fuck
out of here,

06:14.583 --> 06:15.625
I'll kill him.

06:15.709 --> 06:16.752
No, but...

06:16.834 --> 06:19.338
y-your gun's useless now.
It's over.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.548
This thing will still fucking
explode if I pull the trigger,

06:21.632 --> 06:23.884
so get the fuck back!

06:23.966 --> 06:26.552
You know, friend,

06:26.637 --> 06:28.055
it's hard to hold a gun

06:28.137 --> 06:30.598
when it's 500 degrees
Fahrenheit.

06:30.682 --> 06:32.558
No, you idiot, it'll ex...

06:32.643 --> 06:34.185
[screams]

06:34.269 --> 06:36.271
[woman gasping]

06:38.981 --> 06:40.983
[woman screams]

06:41.067 --> 06:42.653
[groaning]

06:42.735 --> 06:43.862
[screaming]

06:45.279 --> 06:47.365
You weren't...

06:47.449 --> 06:48.951
You weren't supposed to do that.

06:49.033 --> 06:50.451
That was you!

06:50.536 --> 06:51.829
What the fuck
do you think happens

06:51.911 --> 06:54.206
when you heat up a fucking gun,
you stupid fuck?

06:54.288 --> 06:56.457
I... I didn't know.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.418
We weren't gonna hurt anybody.

06:58.502 --> 07:01.088
We were trying to save lives.

07:01.170 --> 07:02.923
[crying] Oh, fuck, my hand.

07:03.005 --> 07:05.425
[Sharon] What kind of fucking
superhero are you?

07:05.509 --> 07:07.009
[screaming]

07:10.973 --> 07:12.516
No, no, no. Stop.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.518
I just need to think.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.269
Y-You're all being too loud,

07:16.353 --> 07:19.064
- and I need to think.
- [Sharon] You're a fucking

07:19.148 --> 07:20.399
fascist murderer and...

07:20.481 --> 07:22.233
Shut up!

07:22.317 --> 07:25.153
[groaning]

07:25.237 --> 07:26.112
[screams]

07:26.196 --> 07:28.156
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

07:28.240 --> 07:29.408
Don't... don't be afraid.

07:29.490 --> 07:32.034
This is their fault.
They're the bad guys.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.620
I-I'm the hero. You love me.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.122
You're a monster.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.043
- [panting]
- [screaming]

07:51.430 --> 07:52.430
[gasps]

07:58.312 --> 07:59.771
No...

07:59.855 --> 08:02.024
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.649
[woman grunting]

08:03.733 --> 08:05.151
[coughs]

08:05.235 --> 08:07.571
[panting]

08:07.653 --> 08:08.779
[woman gasps]

08:08.863 --> 08:11.617
Oh, God. Oh, pl-please... Oh...

08:11.699 --> 08:13.160
- [crying] God...
- No, no, no, no.

08:13.242 --> 08:15.661
They... they made me do that.

08:15.745 --> 08:16.872
I didn't want to,

08:16.954 --> 08:18.665
but... they made me.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.047
[panting]

08:25.129 --> 08:27.507
I can explain, okay? Uh...

08:27.591 --> 08:29.509
They had guns, see, and-and...

08:29.593 --> 08:31.928
He murdered everyone.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.764
He killed everyone.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.557
No, no. You...

08:36.642 --> 08:38.309
You don't fucking understand.

08:38.393 --> 08:40.394
Oh, this is perfect, isn't it?

08:40.479 --> 08:43.315
You're gonna use this
to get rid of me, aren't you?

08:43.398 --> 08:45.484
Keep your spot as
Vought's number one hero.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.152
Well, you know what?

08:47.235 --> 08:49.738
That's not gonna happen.

08:49.821 --> 08:51.322
I'm not gonna let you
or anyone else

08:51.405 --> 08:52.365
take my future away from...

08:52.448 --> 08:53.450
- [explosion]
- [grunts]

08:54.909 --> 08:55.911
[grunts]

08:56.912 --> 08:58.038
Come here.

09:04.001 --> 09:07.004
I made one fucking mistake, and
you're gonna hang me over that?

09:13.971 --> 09:16.222
You just don't want
the competition, do you?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.515
But let's be honest,

09:17.599 --> 09:20.309
it's not really
a competition, is it?

09:20.394 --> 09:21.477
[grunts]

09:24.313 --> 09:26.817
Your time's over, Noir.
It's my turn.

09:26.899 --> 09:29.653
I paid my fucking dues.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.745
[gurgling]

09:46.461 --> 09:47.754
It's since... Jesus, fuck!

09:47.837 --> 09:49.840
[static]

10:01.434 --> 10:02.811
[coughing]

10:04.687 --> 10:07.691
Oh... fuck.

10:07.774 --> 10:09.067
[woman coughing]

10:11.820 --> 10:13.822
[panting]

10:20.245 --> 10:22.288
[coughing]

10:29.504 --> 10:30.838
[bones crack]

10:30.922 --> 10:32.131
[body thuds]

10:48.273 --> 10:49.899
They had a bomb.

10:49.982 --> 10:52.903
I covered it with my body,
but the blast was too great.

10:52.985 --> 10:54.653
We searched the rubble.

10:54.738 --> 10:58.075
Sadly,
we're the only survivors.

10:58.158 --> 11:00.451
I failed you, all of you.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.995
No, no. What are you...
[stammers]

11:02.078 --> 11:04.121
You risked your lives for us.

11:04.206 --> 11:06.582
- We're grateful to you.
- [cheers, applause]

11:09.628 --> 11:12.297
Thank you, but... [sighs]

11:12.380 --> 11:14.508
...those poor hostages,

11:14.591 --> 11:16.967
they were the real heroes.

11:17.052 --> 11:21.222
Well, not exactly the rollout
I imagined for you, but...

11:21.306 --> 11:23.307
[sighs]
...you handled it well.

11:23.392 --> 11:26.102
Believe it or not,
even with everyone dead,

11:26.186 --> 11:27.520
your ratings went up.

11:27.604 --> 11:29.355
Good. That's good.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.732
You know,

11:31.817 --> 11:34.235
- you were wrong about Noir.
