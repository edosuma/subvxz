WEBVTT

00:21.730 --> 00:22.814
(door bangs)

00:23.773 --> 00:25.191
Still positive, Mick?

00:28.695 --> 00:29.988
Morning, mom.

00:31.072 --> 00:34.075
(indistinct chattering)

00:40.832 --> 00:43.209
(sighs)

00:46.046 --> 00:49.299
He's still alive, but I'm not optimistic.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.842
Was he ever conscious?

00:52.719 --> 00:55.972
If you're asking who to look for,
I'd say a butcher.

00:56.056 --> 00:57.432
This man was gutted.

00:58.600 --> 00:59.976
Excuse me.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.187
They're out in left field down there.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.272
Sent me in the opposite direction.

01:04.355 --> 01:05.690
So, what do we got?

01:05.774 --> 01:06.983
No good.

01:07.067 --> 01:09.986
(sighs) And they begrudge a cop
a living wage.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.947
Subject to a totally unmotivated attack,

01:13.031 --> 01:14.657
a man lies fighting for his life.

01:15.492 --> 01:18.578
That is your sense, isn't it, Frank?
I mean, it <i>was </i>an unmotivated attack.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.622
Garibaldi wasn't in trouble, was he?

01:22.415 --> 01:24.250
Frank Furillo. I'm Harry's captain.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.086
Anthony Garibaldi.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.004
-Chief Daniels.
-How do you do?

01:28.088 --> 01:30.590
-He's alive?
-Still alive, still in there fighting.

01:30.673 --> 01:33.593
Because they said that
he was extremely critical.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.429
He's a fighter, you know.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.556
I mean, he's still fighting.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.437
This is the time to trust your department!

01:44.521 --> 01:47.190
The people assigned are the ones
that are gonna catch the S.O.B.

01:47.273 --> 01:48.775
who did this to Garibaldi.

01:48.858 --> 01:52.195
Meanwhile, we all got
our own responsibilities and our jobs.

01:52.278 --> 01:53.446
Item one.

01:53.530 --> 01:55.949
A.P.B. remains current for Lee Cleveland.

01:56.032 --> 01:59.077
5'9", 26, black, no distinguishings.

01:59.160 --> 02:00.495
Except he's the mayor's son.

02:00.578 --> 02:02.497
Nothing from the pews today.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.290
He's considered armed and dangerous.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.708
Item two.

02:05.792 --> 02:09.045
A Matt Geaseland's coming through
the Jefferson Corridor this A.M.

02:09.129 --> 02:12.423
He's the guy that's running
across the state for cancer research.

02:12.507 --> 02:14.551
Uh, he's lost a leg to the disease,

02:14.634 --> 02:16.553
which don't make his running any easier,

02:16.636 --> 02:18.763
but from what I hear, he makes out okay.

02:18.847 --> 02:21.099
Check the board upstairs
for crowd control.

02:21.182 --> 02:23.101
-Be of assistance when we can.
-(whispering)

02:23.184 --> 02:24.602
Item three.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.688
Operation Bolita.

02:26.771 --> 02:29.774
State lottery board
is getting its semiannual transfusion

02:29.858 --> 02:31.568
of publicity on our backs today.

02:31.651 --> 02:33.820
Lieutenant Goldblume and Buntz leave

02:33.903 --> 02:36.489
with assigned personnel
right after roll call.

02:36.573 --> 02:40.910
They're gonna coordinate
with Mr. Loring Oler from the state board.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.662
Item four.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.582
Now, let's not forget
while we're worrying about our own

02:45.665 --> 02:48.626
that an individual from the Hack Bureau
went down yesterday, too.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.963
His name is F-R-O-B-E-L.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.382
He had a lousy sense of humor.

02:54.465 --> 02:56.342
Contributions for his kids' tuition

02:56.426 --> 02:58.595
are gonna be accepted
at the Hack Bureau downtown.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.805
Division's gonna be
handling the investigation.

03:00.889 --> 03:04.642
Now, I'm gonna be posting
notices every half hour

03:05.435 --> 03:07.687
or in case Garibaldi's condition changes.

03:07.770 --> 03:11.107
Mobile units,
dispatch is gonna have updates, too.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.235
I mean it, people.

03:14.319 --> 03:17.405
We don't want anybody taking personal time

03:17.488 --> 03:20.950
cowboying around
or going on one-person crusades.

03:22.493 --> 03:25.038
Let's also remember that
the work is dangerous.

03:27.248 --> 03:29.334
That's it. Let's roll. Let's do our jobs.

03:29.417 --> 03:32.962
(indistinct conversations)

03:34.923 --> 03:35.924
Hey!

03:36.007 --> 03:38.426
(conversations fade)

03:39.427 --> 03:40.887
Let's be careful out there.

03:43.097 --> 03:44.224
I got days coming.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.017
I got personal time, Neal.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.353
Division gave us extra detectives.
Thanks, guys.

03:49.062 --> 03:50.980
Henry? Listen.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.190
We're rousting bookies.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.275
Give us a chance
with the guys you pop, okay?

03:55.818 --> 03:56.903
You got it.

03:58.947 --> 04:00.573
Let me explain something here.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.618
You guys are playing the horses.
I'm gonna be buying the race.

04:03.701 --> 04:04.869
Here we go!

04:05.620 --> 04:06.537
Three minutes.

04:06.621 --> 04:11.459
Yeah, but all fresh bills, Arthur.
All fresh bills. (laughs)

04:11.542 --> 04:13.628
Oh, look. Hey, you tell me

04:13.711 --> 04:17.465
another country where you got a shot
as good as you got here.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.676
You can't tell me, right? You know why?

04:19.759 --> 04:22.887
Because this country
is the greatest country

04:22.971 --> 04:24.097
on the planet Earth.

04:24.180 --> 04:26.891
Especially if you hit a $9 number, right?

04:26.975 --> 04:29.269
Listen, Smokey,
you want to learn something?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.020
Did Thomas Jefferson hit his number?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.438
-What?
-No.

04:32.522 --> 04:36.317
Was Abraham Lincoln playing single action
with his Gettysburg Address? No.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.236
So because I hit my number

04:38.319 --> 04:41.239
does not change
if I am correct in my point or not.

04:41.322 --> 04:42.448
Cops.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.450
-Get out of here!
-Where, cops?

04:44.534 --> 04:47.704
-They're gonna bust the smoke shop.
-You can't bust a smoke shop!

04:47.787 --> 04:49.247
Out of the way, fellas.

04:49.330 --> 04:51.708
I got a numbers slip in there!
I didn't get paid yet!

04:51.791 --> 04:55.336
Sid! You're on probation, man!

04:55.420 --> 04:56.963
Get the hell out of there!

04:57.046 --> 04:58.172
-MAN: Move!
-Ah, you...

04:59.632 --> 05:01.301
Hey, where you going, Ace?

05:01.384 --> 05:02.760
I'm not flushing evidence.

05:02.844 --> 05:04.554
I happen to got a bladder infection.

05:04.637 --> 05:07.140
Yeah? Well, you can
go down at the station. Look out.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.850
Grab him, please, will you?

05:12.437 --> 05:15.398
Hey! What is going on here!

05:15.481 --> 05:17.859
-What kind of fascist crap is this?
-You employed here?

05:17.942 --> 05:20.111
No, but I do have
a little bit of business.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.572
Arthur, you know I hit that number!

05:22.655 --> 05:24.657
They're taking all my work.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.284
There's a $9 number in there.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.703
That's a $3,600 score!

05:28.786 --> 05:31.914
If you played the legal lottery,
you wouldn't have these kind of problems.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.250
Oh, yeah? I hope you get dysentery.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.794
I hope you trip
and fall on an onrushing truck.

05:36.878 --> 05:38.963
You don't want to get popped,
I suggest you leave.

05:39.047 --> 05:40.840
Oh, if I don't want to get popped?

05:40.923 --> 05:42.592
I want to eat my arm!

05:42.675 --> 05:46.054
You know, they show it to you,
they let you smell it cooking,

05:46.137 --> 05:48.723
but they never let you taste it!

05:48.806 --> 05:51.184
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:51.267 --> 05:53.478
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

05:53.561 --> 05:57.482
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

06:04.447 --> 06:07.867
(theme music playing)

07:34.829 --> 07:37.874
Hey, look, I'm a nickel operator, fellas.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.168
I don't give no one credit
to get in trouble.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.919
No less, I'm gonna go and whack a cop?

07:42.003 --> 07:44.464
Okay, Freddie, we'll be looking
to hear from you, okay?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.299
-Total cooperation.
-Mm-hmm.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.969
-We've got nothing.
-Here.

07:50.928 --> 07:52.430
Andy Sedita.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.685
What's this, victimless crime day?

07:57.768 --> 07:58.853
What the hell's going on?

07:58.936 --> 08:01.022
Some questions for you, Andy. Come on.

08:03.566 --> 08:04.567
Trenton.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.028
Hey, applied for that job at the Korean's.

08:07.111 --> 08:09.697
-You get it?
-Yeah, looks like I did.

08:10.448 --> 08:12.909
So, um, look,
I was remembering what you said,

08:12.992 --> 08:15.578
-about fronting me for the calculator.
-Mm-hmm.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.581
I, um, priced them at three places,

08:18.664 --> 08:20.750
and it looks like Bernbaum's got the best.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.835
So what's the damage?

08:22.919 --> 08:24.170
$8.95.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.547
Oh, no big deal.

08:26.631 --> 08:29.300
-Here we go.
-I don't got any change.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.677
Just owe me ten bucks.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.678
First paycheck.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.097
I appreciate this.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.140
Alright.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.100
You take care of business now.

08:38.184 --> 08:40.019
Give me a for instance.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.938
When could that evidence be released?

08:42.021 --> 08:43.981
You're getting to be
a real pain in the groin.

08:44.065 --> 08:46.275
I'm sorry you missed your hit.

08:46.359 --> 08:48.110
Come on, I just got out of the joint.

08:48.194 --> 08:51.197
We could be talking about
maybe my last $9 here.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.323
Bust this guy.

08:52.406 --> 08:54.784
Okay! All right!

08:55.368 --> 08:56.911
-Hello.
-Hello.

08:56.994 --> 08:58.996
Detectives Larue or Washington around?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.873
They're busy right now.

09:00.957 --> 09:03.960
-Captain. How's Garibaldi?
-Stan. No change.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.212
Mayor's waiting for you.

09:06.295 --> 09:08.130
Duty guy says he's been
in and out all night.

09:08.214 --> 09:09.382
Anything new on his son?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.884
Ozzie has him guilty
back to the Brinks job.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.594
No khakis today.

09:14.595 --> 09:15.555
Hill Street.

09:23.771 --> 09:24.814
How's your man?

09:26.274 --> 09:27.400
Bad.

09:27.483 --> 09:29.360
-What is it?
-Look at the night sheet.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.660
Three crimes in a 4-block area
and no arrests.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.038
It's a high-crime area, Ozzie.
That neighborhood has three robberies

09:41.122 --> 09:43.749
-half the nights of the week.
-He's doing those crimes.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.334
I want a saturation patrol.

09:45.418 --> 09:47.211
That'd be inappropriate.
Have you been home?

09:47.295 --> 09:50.464
What isn't appropriate
is you answering professional inquiries

09:50.548 --> 09:53.175
with intrusions into my personal life.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.554
You know, maybe if you hadn't bee
so liberal with advice to Leona,

09:56.637 --> 09:58.389
she wouldn't have bailed him out.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.726
I'm sorry.

10:03.644 --> 10:04.895
I...

10:06.564 --> 10:08.566
I think of him doing these things,

10:08.649 --> 10:09.900
hurting people,

10:10.943 --> 10:12.445
destroying himself.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.450
(sighs) Maybe I should go home.

10:17.533 --> 10:18.951
I'll keep you informed.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.079
Mayor.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.582
A.D.A. Bernstein.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.043
I want the makeup of the panel.

10:27.126 --> 10:28.502
Keep me apprised on that.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.178
Kids are easy.

10:37.261 --> 10:38.971
My two stay indoors till they're 40.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.473
After that, they're on their own.

10:40.556 --> 10:43.392
I know you've got other things
on your mind besides the commission.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.102
I'd like to have you serve as counsel.

10:45.186 --> 10:47.521
I want to.
The department needs this, Frank.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.774
-But?
-(sighs) Hmm.

10:49.857 --> 10:53.402
(sighs) Leigh was in my office
when you called yesterday.

10:53.486 --> 10:54.612
She hit the roof.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.656
You're probably never home as it is.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.367
Any kind of estimate as to time frame?

11:00.493 --> 11:03.120
I could tell you ten days for the hearings

11:03.204 --> 11:05.373
and then two weeks to write the reports.

11:05.456 --> 11:06.499
No way to know.

11:06.582 --> 11:08.042
It depends on what we turn up.

11:08.125 --> 11:09.543
I want to do it.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.671
I also want a marriage to come home to.

11:11.754 --> 11:12.922
I'm seeing Leigh for lunch.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.757
-Can you give me the morning?
-Sure.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.844
How are you gonna juggle the time?

11:18.928 --> 11:20.096
I take the fifth.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.642
I didn't know that Korean was hiring.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.019
I went by The Kubiak
last night and saw a sign up.

11:27.103 --> 11:28.229
Ain't that nice?

11:28.312 --> 11:30.356
It's wonderful to see
how people can change.

11:30.439 --> 11:31.857
Now the only question is

11:31.941 --> 11:34.235
can that Trenton Moore boy use an abacus?

11:34.318 --> 11:37.154
That's real funny, Renko.
I'm getting him a calculator, alright?

11:37.238 --> 11:39.240
-Ain't you sweet?
-Yeah.

11:39.323 --> 11:41.325
-Excuse me.
-Belker?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.576
Belker.

11:43.744 --> 11:44.912
Hi, sis.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.208
Luana, Luan--

11:49.291 --> 11:52.837
Luana, you are not going
to contest the will.

11:52.920 --> 11:54.088
That isn't grounds.

11:54.171 --> 11:57.258
You can't get a will thrown out
on grounds of spite.

11:58.175 --> 12:01.137
I don't agree. I don't think she was
punishing you for moving to Hawaii.

12:01.220 --> 12:04.682
I think ma just wanted to give
Aunt Tessie the broach.

12:04.765 --> 12:05.891
That was it.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.686
Please, stop it. You don't mean that.

12:09.979 --> 12:12.857
Luana, if that came true,
you know how bad you would feel?

12:12.940 --> 12:15.151
I don't think Aunt Tessie
drives anymore anyway.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.695
Sis, I gotta go.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.114
Everything okay with you?

12:22.491 --> 12:24.869
A Samoan? Really.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.663
Let me know if it gets serious.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.708
Robin's fine.

12:30.791 --> 12:31.876
Actually...

12:33.169 --> 12:35.880
Actually, she's fine.
I'll talk to you soon.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.882
You too. Bye.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.010
(sighs)

12:41.093 --> 12:43.721
I didn't know Garibaldi very well.

12:43.804 --> 12:47.016
Oh, don't yield him
to the past tense yet, Ballantine.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.351
We never know when hope will be rewarded.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.190
My word. Maura.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.323
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

13:02.406 --> 13:03.783
What are you doing here?

13:04.492 --> 13:07.369
There's somebody I couldn't
get out of my mind.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.998
Listen, Howard,
could you take me to the bus stop?

13:11.081 --> 13:12.792
Otherwise, I'm gonna be late for work.

13:13.459 --> 13:15.544
I suppose I could take ten minutes.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.004
Could you make it 15?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.048
What do you need five extra minutes for?

13:20.090 --> 13:22.009
So we can park in an alley.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.094
(chuckles)

13:24.178 --> 13:26.263
Uh, 15 minutes, Ballantine!

13:26.972 --> 13:28.307
Personal time!

13:28.390 --> 13:29.683
You wanton.

13:29.767 --> 13:31.769
Filthy, rutting swine.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.395
(laughs) Jeez.

13:37.358 --> 13:39.193
There's something funny about that woman.

13:39.276 --> 13:41.904
-The lieutenant's dating that?
-Yeah.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.739
He met her last night at The Kubiak.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.992
I think she's very attractive.
Her name is Maura.

13:47.535 --> 13:48.661
Maura, huh?

13:48.744 --> 13:51.413
Well, when we used to pop her up
at the heights for solicitation,

13:51.497 --> 13:52.915
her name was Maurice.

13:53.874 --> 13:54.875
Ho ho!

13:55.751 --> 13:58.087
Look, our khakis aren't gonna
be back until tomorrow.

13:58.170 --> 14:01.048
Now, I definitely said
that we needed that temp for two days.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.175
I'm not gonna argue with you.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.177
Just get somebody up here, will you?

14:05.261 --> 14:07.346
Hold on. It's Leo.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.432
Oh, uh, I'll call you back.
Maybe it's okay.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.562
Leo, you dashing young swain,

14:14.645 --> 14:16.897
any shot of you coming in a day early?

14:19.441 --> 14:20.442
What?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.612
Oh, I see.

14:25.072 --> 14:26.657
Yeah, sure.

14:28.242 --> 14:29.702
Yeah, that's a big surprise.

14:30.452 --> 14:32.246
Hell, it's a huge surprise.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.916
Well, all the best to you.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.751
-What?
-(talks indistinctly)

14:39.295 --> 14:41.630
-They eloped.
-Who eloped?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.549
Leo and Natalie.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.635
-(exhales)
-They're gonna move to New Zealand.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.805
They want to raise a family
in a nuclear-free zone.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.640
Excuse me.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.852
I'm gonna keep my ear
to the ground, Detective,

14:54.935 --> 14:57.062
though in my opinion,
when a man gets cut in alley,

14:57.146 --> 14:58.480
I look for some junkie.

14:58.564 --> 15:00.608
I figure some yob looking to fix.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.692
Appreciate it.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.403
Come on.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.780
-Are we getting anywhere?
-Nowhere.

15:11.660 --> 15:15.205
Mr. Garibaldi? I'm Patsy Mayo.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.000
I was your son's partner
up until a few months ago.

15:19.043 --> 15:20.044
I'm his father.

15:22.755 --> 15:25.466
-Is there any change?
-No, no change.

15:26.926 --> 15:31.722
(sighs) They asked if they could
have his organs if he passed on.

15:33.724 --> 15:35.100
You hate to give up hope.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.310
Then don't.

15:36.393 --> 15:38.729
-Mind if I sit?
-Please.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.815
(hospital announcements)

15:45.152 --> 15:47.529
The manager said they cleaned
the van out totally.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.157
They took the stereo,
the suitcase with the contributions.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.577
Uh, folks, folks, please,
just step back behind the van, everyone.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.580
Press, photographers--
back behind the van, everyone!

15:56.664 --> 15:58.290
All right. Thank you very much.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
He says they stole about 5,000 or 6,000.

16:00.459 --> 16:03.087
Where's Jerry?
Anybody look in the closet? Anyb--

16:03.170 --> 16:04.296
Who's Jerry?

16:04.380 --> 16:06.715
Are you this guy here, Matt Geaseland?

16:06.799 --> 16:09.385
Yeah, but did anybody
check in the hotel...

16:09.468 --> 16:10.803
Don't worry. I'll handle this.

16:10.886 --> 16:12.972
-Don't be breaking into a sweat now.
-Who are you?

16:13.055 --> 16:15.307
I'm McDonoghue.
Jerry McDonoghue. I'm his manager.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.060
Anyway, can you believe these people, huh?

16:18.143 --> 16:20.854
Guy runs his heart out 200 miles
on one leg and one big heart,

16:20.938 --> 16:24.274
-and they take everything he stood for.
-You got a time of loss estimate, Mr...

16:24.358 --> 16:27.027
McDonoghue. Jerry McDonoghue.
I'm his personal manager.

16:27.111 --> 16:29.279
You know what I was doing?
I was loading the last load

16:29.363 --> 16:31.490
-in the alley here,
-Come out, whammo.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.284
The window's smashed, see?
Speakers ripped out.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.245
Suitcase with our contributions gone.

16:36.328 --> 16:38.330
Figure they maybe don't even
know what they got.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.124
-You know what I mean?
-Hey, listen here.

16:40.207 --> 16:42.418
I gotta get going
or I'm not gonna make my eight miles.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.670
Don't worry, Matt.
I'll get this taken care of.

16:44.753 --> 16:46.130
Are you gonna bring the van?

16:46.213 --> 16:48.215
-Me and Murph. Yeah.
-Hey, come on, guys.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.218
If we don't make the Jefferson Overpass
by noon, we can forget it.

16:51.301 --> 16:52.302
So go! Go on, go.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.848
Okay, I'll see you later, okay?
I'll see you at 139th Street.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.017
-You got it.
-Okay.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.602
Mr. McDonoghue, we're gonna need you
for about an hour or so.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.064
What? For crying out loud. How come? Why?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.900
Let's get over here.
Let me tell you something.

17:06.984 --> 17:10.779
See, if you're right and these guys
don't know what they've got,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.741
maybe we can see somebody
with a suitcase walking around here.

17:13.824 --> 17:15.909
-You think?
-Yeah, I think so, and also,

17:15.993 --> 17:18.078
there's a lot of paperwork
to take care of, right?

17:18.162 --> 17:19.413
Yeah, the main event figures.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.957
Step right in here.
We'll take a little ride, won't we?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.001
(indistinct talking over police radio)

17:24.668 --> 17:26.754
200 miles on one leg for nothing.

17:27.671 --> 17:28.839
Unbelievable.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.808
We'll have a statement
at the hotel Swain tonight.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.769
Our next stop. Is the robbery gonna mean

17:41.852 --> 17:44.688
-the cancellation of his run?
-Nothing's gonna make Matt quit.

17:44.772 --> 17:47.691
The question's whether logistically
we'll be able to meet expenses.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.778
Give him the support he needs.
The man just had six months chemotherapy.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.863
There's also $8,000 contributions

17:52.946 --> 17:55.741
are not gonna be made up
unless he gets some generous individuals

17:55.824 --> 17:57.701
or conceivably a foundation
to come forward

17:57.785 --> 17:59.661
-and give us support--
-Sign here and here.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.455
-Thank you.
-Excuse me, men.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.084
Are you associated with
the courageous runner?

18:05.167 --> 18:07.711
Matt Geaseland, right.
I'm Jerry McDonoghue, his coach.

18:07.795 --> 18:09.505
Fletcher Daniels. Chief of police.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.632
Heard about the robbery in my car.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.511
You men are gonna get
full S.I.D. backup on this one.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.097
-Take Coach McGarnagle back to the--
-McDonoghue.

18:18.180 --> 18:20.557
Back to the crime scene.
Do a full witness workup.

18:20.641 --> 18:22.810
I'd like to get back with Matt
as soon as possible.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.354
Listen to me, Coach McDonoghue,

18:25.437 --> 18:27.397
on behalf of this city
and this department,

18:27.481 --> 18:28.565
I pledge to you,

18:28.649 --> 18:30.776
difficult though street crime
may be to solve,

18:30.859 --> 18:33.654
-on this one, we're hanging tough.
-Uh-huh.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.114
Notify S.I.D. where to meet you.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.949
Okay, coach, let's get on it.

18:37.032 --> 18:39.243
I don't know
what this is gonna accomplish.

18:39.326 --> 18:42.204
After all, this is wasted energy
unless of course you get

18:42.287 --> 18:44.873
some generous individuals
or conceivably a foundation

18:44.957 --> 18:47.793
to come forward and give us the support
we need and deserve.

18:48.877 --> 18:52.297
The robbery of this cripple
has frosted even my cool cookies, Frank.

18:53.090 --> 18:55.551
I just made S.I.D.
available to your uniforms.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.762
-Thanks for the help, Chief.
-Yeah. Coffee?

18:59.847 --> 19:01.431
Also, just to keep you current,

19:01.515 --> 19:04.268
I turned Ozzie Cleveland down
on an attempted end run.

19:04.351 --> 19:05.394
Saturation patrols.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.647
Yeah. Poor guy's off the deep end.

19:08.730 --> 19:11.066
He wants your whole precinct
out after his son.

19:12.025 --> 19:13.986
Also, I gather we're status quo
on Garibaldi?

19:14.069 --> 19:15.070
Status quo.

19:17.197 --> 19:19.324
So I just wanted to keep you up to date.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.786
Chief, I haven't picked anybody
for the commission yet.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.289
-How did it go with Gene Scapizzi?
-Rescheduled. Chief--

19:25.372 --> 19:27.833
Frank, am I disqualified
from having opinions?

19:27.916 --> 19:30.377
Am I allowed to hope you pick a good man?

19:30.460 --> 19:31.503
Oh, Lord.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.380
Go ahead and duck me, Chief Daniels.

19:33.463 --> 19:36.216
Why should today be any different
than the last four weeks?

19:36.300 --> 19:39.094
I wasn't ducking you at all, Fay.
I'm glad to see you.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.180
-Frank, how's Harry doing?
-Lousy.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.973
Well, gotta run.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.225
Oh, Chief, have you seen
our budget proposal?

19:45.309 --> 19:47.227
We're going over it, Fay. I told you that.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.812
With what, tweezers?

19:48.896 --> 19:51.481
The cost savings
I'm suggesting will allow us

19:51.565 --> 19:53.400
to put the victims' aid
back in the precinct

19:53.483 --> 19:55.652
for only 8% more than
the present allocation.

19:55.736 --> 19:56.737
Excuse me.

19:56.820 --> 20:00.949
Great. Speedy Gonzales.
I'm only asking for what's fair.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.493
Actually, Fay,
you're asking for a good deal more.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.789
What? A stinking 8%?

20:07.873 --> 20:12.169
Fay, when a determination has been made,
you will hear from my office.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.462
Please excuse me.

20:21.094 --> 20:23.430
-Hi.
-How are you?

20:24.097 --> 20:26.308
Okay. How are you?

20:26.892 --> 20:28.518
I wasn't the one who was up all night.

20:29.144 --> 20:31.396
-(sighs)
-Any word on Garibaldi?

20:32.731 --> 20:35.567
Well, they said his heart was irregular.

20:36.318 --> 20:37.861
Then it stabilized again.

20:39.988 --> 20:40.989
Um...

20:41.073 --> 20:42.199
Gene Scapizzi.

20:43.033 --> 20:44.576
Seeing him for the commission.

20:45.244 --> 20:46.995
Are you going to be able to do all this?

20:48.580 --> 20:50.374
I'll have to pass on dinner, though.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.085
I thought if you were
going to the hospital,

20:53.168 --> 20:54.461
I'd like to go with you.

20:54.544 --> 20:56.046
You sure?

20:56.129 --> 20:57.172
Yeah.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.549
Get some of that good cafeteria food.

20:59.633 --> 21:01.343
(laughter)

21:04.263 --> 21:06.431
-Frank.
-Gene. You know Joyce.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.684
-Gene Scapizzi.
-Yes, of course. How are you?

21:08.767 --> 21:09.768
Captain.

21:11.311 --> 21:12.437
Captain.

21:18.360 --> 21:19.987
Man, we're coming up empty.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.072
Detective work, babe. Detective work.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.616
In every 20 haystacks,
there's bound to be a needle.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.036
Hey, J.D.! Neal!

21:28.120 --> 21:29.788
-Hi, Sid.
-Hey, Sid, how you doing, man?

21:29.871 --> 21:31.415
-I'm doing fine.
-Make your parole?

21:31.498 --> 21:33.750
I made my parole easy as pie.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.586
I've been having a little bad
luck since I've been out.

21:36.670 --> 21:38.880
Takes a little time readjusting, Sid.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.174
I understand you guys are
questioning some bookies

21:41.258 --> 21:45.012
-about a cop that got hit.
-Yeah. Garibaldi.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.138
Harry Garibaldi.

21:46.221 --> 21:49.641
I know him. He's, uh, black hair...

21:49.725 --> 21:50.851
Come here. Come here.

21:52.561 --> 21:53.687
What do you got?

21:54.396 --> 21:58.108
Listen, I'm gonna be absolutely
straight with you guys.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.985
I had some paper that was confiscated

22:00.068 --> 22:02.279
in that numbers pop this morning.

22:02.362 --> 22:04.323
I was wondering
if there's any conceivable way

22:04.406 --> 22:06.742
-that maybe I can get that back.
-Sid, you just admitted

22:06.825 --> 22:08.660
to frequenting a gambling establishment.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.954
Now, you know that's a violation
of your parole, man.

22:11.038 --> 22:14.499
Come on, guys, this was a $3,600--

22:14.583 --> 22:16.209
Garibaldi, huh?

22:16.293 --> 22:18.545
What is this, roller derby?

22:19.504 --> 22:23.342
Listen, it was a horse room
on Utica and Jefferson.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.178
The guy used to come in all the time.
He had a line of credit.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.472
A couple of guys said
that maybe he was a cop.

22:29.264 --> 22:30.265
So?

22:31.975 --> 22:34.978
So what's this worth to me?
Maybe, like, half a "C"?

22:35.062 --> 22:36.980
What corner of Jefferson and Utica, huh?

22:37.064 --> 22:38.815
Oh, South...

22:39.733 --> 22:40.901
Come on! Come on!

22:41.526 --> 22:44.029
I always get confused
with this. Southwest side.

22:44.112 --> 22:47.199
All right, if there's anything in it,
you get 50 more, yeah?

22:47.282 --> 22:48.492
-Okay.
-Come on, Neal.

22:52.996 --> 22:55.040
I know you guys are just doing your jobs.

22:55.123 --> 22:57.042
Your chief told you
to take me out here, right?

22:57.125 --> 22:58.377
Yes, sir, he did.

22:58.460 --> 23:01.880
Well, the point is,
just between us, you know,

23:01.963 --> 23:03.799
Matt does not have a great prognosis.

23:03.882 --> 23:06.426
-Is he aware of that?
-It depends on what you mean "aware."

23:06.510 --> 23:09.429
This thing's got phases, you know?
How people accept it.

23:09.513 --> 23:13.058
What I'm saying is, he's pretty
discouraged right now.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.102
I'd like to get back there with him.

23:15.185 --> 23:16.937
If you'll show us where
the van was parked.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.065
We'll have some
S.I.D. detective types come down here,

23:20.148 --> 23:21.900
and solve the whole shooting match.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.653
The van was parked...
it was right here against this wall.

23:24.736 --> 23:28.156
-Right here. Parked right here--
-Good for you! Good!

23:28.240 --> 23:30.367
-You caught him!
-Caught who?

23:30.450 --> 23:34.079
Who I seen breaking into
that van was parked here before.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.540
-You mean this man?
-What the hell's he talking about?

23:36.623 --> 23:38.583
I'm talking about you, mister,

23:38.667 --> 23:40.877
and that van
with the crippled boy's picture on it.

23:40.961 --> 23:42.963
The man's a lunatic.
What are you, drunk, huh?

23:43.046 --> 23:45.132
I happen to be
Mr. Geaseland's personal manager.

23:45.215 --> 23:48.260
More shame on you, then.
I come out here this morning.

23:48.343 --> 23:52.722
I see this man here take a brick,
smash the window first.

23:52.806 --> 23:55.142
Then he goes in with a key,

23:55.225 --> 23:57.477
pulls out the stereo, and takes them!

23:58.353 --> 24:01.022
Except some of the wires
he throws in the dumpster.

24:01.106 --> 24:02.858
You got your cards shuffled, bro!

24:02.941 --> 24:04.609
You gonna believe a damn street gimp?

24:04.693 --> 24:06.736
The guy's on lithium five to one.

24:10.991 --> 24:14.453
That's the items right there,
and I'll sign the complaint.

24:14.536 --> 24:16.163
This is nuts!

24:16.246 --> 24:18.623
I'm the guy's manager for crying out loud!

24:18.707 --> 24:21.835
-Jerry? Coach.
-What?

24:23.044 --> 24:24.379
You're busted, pal.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.131
Let's go.

24:27.466 --> 24:30.385
-Hey! That's it! Everybody back!
-I'm minding my own business,

24:30.469 --> 24:34.306
and this kid robs me.
Black kid, about 5'10".

24:34.389 --> 24:37.142
Pistol whips me,
and I'm driving around looking for him,

24:37.225 --> 24:39.769
-couldn't find him--
-Where did he rob you?

24:39.853 --> 24:41.938
Uh, Michigan. Michigan and Genesee.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.107
-He'll probably try to score.
-Aah!

24:44.191 --> 24:45.650
-Yeah, that's good.
-You alright?

24:45.734 --> 24:47.903
-I'm okay.
-Come on. Back seat if you can walk.

24:47.986 --> 24:48.862
Stand.

24:50.405 --> 24:51.406
Let's go.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.993
(upbeat music playing)

24:55.076 --> 24:57.621
(woman on patrol speaker)

25:05.837 --> 25:08.381
WOMAN: <i>Genesee. Suspect is armed...</i>

25:12.469 --> 25:13.929
There he is right there.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.892
BATES: Get down. Get down.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.904
Hey, Lee! Police!

25:30.987 --> 25:32.906
Put your stuff down.

25:33.698 --> 25:35.200
You're busted, man.

25:35.283 --> 25:36.826
Put your hands over your head.

25:38.912 --> 25:41.706
Everything's gonna be okay.
Just take it nice and slow.

25:43.542 --> 25:45.252
(gunshots)

25:51.675 --> 25:54.844
(siren wailing)

25:57.639 --> 26:00.725
-Who was point?
-I was point. Sergeant Bates was backup.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.772
That's right where he belongs.

26:05.855 --> 26:07.857
-Come on, fella.
-This animal robbed me.

26:07.941 --> 26:10.944
-Come on.
-Put a gun to my head. I'm glad he's dead.

26:13.446 --> 26:16.283
(indistinct chattering)

26:34.718 --> 26:35.719
(kicking door)

26:37.012 --> 26:38.221
What's our problem here?

26:38.305 --> 26:39.681
Police. You're under arrest.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.851
For what? You guys think the phones
were never invented?

26:42.934 --> 26:45.103
Everyone knows you're hitting
all the horse rooms.

26:45.186 --> 26:48.273
Don't cop no attitude, old dude.
We want to know the name of your boss.

26:48.356 --> 26:51.484
-Who'd be in charge of giving credit?
-Credit for what?

26:53.737 --> 26:57.157
-Well, looky here! Andy Sedita!
-What's going on?

26:57.240 --> 26:59.993
-We have to talk some more, Andy.
-About what?

27:00.076 --> 27:02.120
Maybe you forgot
to tell us a few things, Andy!

27:02.203 --> 27:03.038
About what?

27:03.121 --> 27:04.998
About a certain cop used
to play the horses in here.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.083
Down at the station,
we'll tell you all about it.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.293
Send us a bill.

27:14.132 --> 27:17.761
So you kicked a wall down.
Did you check the lease?

27:17.844 --> 27:19.679
Beause I got no connection
with that place.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.098
You just sit back there
and trim your nails.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.100
I drink coffee. It's a coffee room.

27:24.184 --> 27:26.770
If you'd gone in the alley,
come to the door like a gentleman--

27:26.853 --> 27:28.730
That's your horse room, Andy.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.692
Well, looks like
I gotta bother my attorney.

27:32.776 --> 27:35.153
Forget it. You're not gonna call him.

27:35.236 --> 27:37.322
What? I explained it--

27:37.405 --> 27:39.491
He did it, Neal. He killed Garibaldi.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.993
This guy's crazy. I want my attorney.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.579
-Hey, easy, J.D.!
-You're out of control.

27:44.663 --> 27:45.914
-Take your jacket off.
-What?

27:45.997 --> 27:47.248
-Take your jacket off.
-What?

27:47.332 --> 27:49.417
Take your jacket off.
Take it off! Come on.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.544
Hey, Neal, take a whiff. That's murder.

27:51.628 --> 27:53.755
Garibaldi was betting with you.
How deep did he go?

27:53.838 --> 27:55.340
I don't know who bets--

27:55.423 --> 27:56.883
Did you croak him, Andy? Huh?

27:56.966 --> 27:58.218
I want my attorney!

27:58.301 --> 27:59.302
You did it!

28:02.097 --> 28:04.015
Can you get me a soft drink?

28:04.099 --> 28:07.143
I got low blood sugar,
and my ears are beginning to ring.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.269
Please.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.857
We gotta say something to him.

28:12.941 --> 28:15.485
Mr. Mayor, I'm sorry.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.612
He gave us no way out.

28:19.572 --> 28:20.865
I'm sure that's so.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.826
We identified ourselves.

28:22.909 --> 28:24.661
He put his weapon right on my partner.

28:25.912 --> 28:26.996
I'm sorry, sir.

28:30.250 --> 28:32.919
Sir? Is there anything
you'd like to ask me about it?

28:35.004 --> 28:36.131
Excuse me.

28:37.298 --> 28:38.591
Frank!

28:38.675 --> 28:39.968
Ray?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.721
I was just at the hospital.
They don't think Garibaldi

28:42.804 --> 28:44.931
-will live through the day.
-I know. I heard.

28:45.682 --> 28:49.102
Oh, I just cleared out my desk.

28:49.185 --> 28:50.854
Nervous about the command?

28:50.937 --> 28:52.814
I feel so unprotected,

28:52.897 --> 28:55.734
like I'm going out to sea
in a tiny boat alone.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.695
I feel a little unprotected myself
knowing you're not gonna be here.

28:58.778 --> 29:01.239
We're only a telephone call
away from each other.

29:01.322 --> 29:03.825
Ray, I know you're gonna be very busy,
but you've heard about

29:03.908 --> 29:06.077
the commission I'm heading
to investigate Keenan.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.329
-The corruption, of course.
-If it's corruption.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.206
Yes. If.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.751
You'd be a great asset if you'd serve.

29:12.834 --> 29:15.128
Really? You would choose me?

29:15.211 --> 29:18.339
-I just did.
-Thank you, Frank.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.924
Captain Calletano's on board.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.092
Good.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.136
Mr. Mayor.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.432
I am deeply sorry.

29:28.433 --> 29:29.559
Thank you.

29:31.144 --> 29:32.395
Excuse me.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.111
Thanks for all you did, Frank.

29:42.655 --> 29:44.574
Leona and I both appreciate it.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.035
I'm sorry, Oz.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.962
You can't believe how much you remember.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.808
You guys don't understand something.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.518
-What's that? Finish.
-Let me finish.

30:11.601 --> 30:13.812
The run, the money raising,
we weren't gonna make it.

30:13.895 --> 30:16.439
I don't know.
The money's been a trickle, see?

30:16.523 --> 30:19.150
A few people donated services,
but then we got expenses.

30:19.234 --> 30:21.361
We got meals, hotels. Every day, he runs.

30:21.444 --> 30:24.239
Every day, we fall farther
behind the goal he set.

30:24.322 --> 30:27.158
So you figured that you
would stage a robbery,

30:27.242 --> 30:29.661
stir up a little sympathy,
and let the guilt money roll in.

30:29.744 --> 30:32.205
Plus we'd still have the dough
that was supposed to be gone.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.873
I just couldn't stand to see him fail.

30:33.957 --> 30:35.875
Don't suppose you
talked this over with Matt.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.585
Are you kidding? To demoralize him?

30:37.669 --> 30:39.045
To implicate him in a fraud?

30:39.128 --> 30:42.048
Oh, Lord, will you look at this?

30:43.174 --> 30:45.051
Ever tell him you had six convictions,

30:45.134 --> 30:47.762
you're barred from racetracks
up and down the east coast?

30:47.846 --> 30:50.014
-Oh, for crying out loud.
-That is the lamest story

30:50.098 --> 30:51.266
I have heard in a month,

30:51.349 --> 30:53.393
and besides that, you filed a false report

30:53.476 --> 30:55.353
-to my partner and me!
-Okay, I filed--

30:55.436 --> 30:57.188
And you stole the money.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.273
Mr. McDonoghue?

30:58.356 --> 31:00.233
I'm Joyce Davenport, public defender.

31:00.900 --> 31:01.818
May we?

31:01.901 --> 31:03.152
-Yes.
-Yeah.

31:08.449 --> 31:11.202
You gotta let me out of here.
You can't do this.

31:11.286 --> 31:12.704
We can't?

31:12.787 --> 31:14.497
You mean this isn't happening, Andy?

31:14.581 --> 31:16.499
You can't hold me! I want to go!

31:18.251 --> 31:19.627
Something worrying you?

31:20.587 --> 31:21.588
Hey, Neal?

31:23.631 --> 31:26.384
Why would this strunz
be so anxious to get out?

31:26.467 --> 31:28.261
You got some skirt waiting, Andy?

31:28.344 --> 31:30.430
Afraid maybe someone knows you're in here,

31:30.513 --> 31:32.807
maybe someone thinks
you're gonna give him up?

31:33.558 --> 31:34.893
Neal? J.D.?

31:34.976 --> 31:37.312
I want to get out of here!
Talk to my attorney!

31:37.395 --> 31:38.438
Stay.

31:44.611 --> 31:46.404
-Is that Andy Sedita?
-Yup.

31:46.487 --> 31:49.449
His lawyer at the front desk
wants to know if we're holding him.

31:49.532 --> 31:52.035
Why was interrogation
signed to a John Doe?

31:52.118 --> 31:54.746
That guy in there is wrong, Captain.
We want to sweat him.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.748
We know that Harry
gambled with him, Captain.

31:56.831 --> 31:59.334
An our informant thought that
he might have a line of credit.

31:59.417 --> 32:01.044
-Do we have a charge? Kick him.
-No.

32:01.127 --> 32:03.254
Look, Captain, up to now,
we got squat on this case.

32:03.338 --> 32:04.839
We're gonna have to take some shots.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.216
Put a tail on him if you want,
but get him out of here.

32:13.222 --> 32:15.183
Mr. McDonoghue and I have conferred.

32:16.309 --> 32:18.728
Is there any chance
if Mr. McDonoghue returned the money,

32:18.811 --> 32:21.564
-if Matt Geaseland didn't press charges…
-Look, I'm not asking--

32:21.648 --> 32:25.068
…could we then drop on the false filing?

32:25.151 --> 32:26.736
I don't want to ask this for me.

32:26.819 --> 32:29.697
I'm asking this because
I don't want to see Matt go in the bucket.

32:29.781 --> 32:34.369
He's getting real sick,
and he doesn't have much longer.

32:35.536 --> 32:37.914
We gotta report the crime
to the victim at least.

32:37.997 --> 32:40.625
Just gimme that chance.
Just leave it up to him.

32:42.502 --> 32:43.586
Let's go.

32:49.968 --> 32:52.095
I'd appreciate in the future
you give me a jingle

32:52.178 --> 32:54.263
before you violate my client's rights.

32:55.598 --> 32:58.101
<i>Adiós</i>, Andy. Keep in touch.

33:01.896 --> 33:04.482
I don't think Sedita did it,
I don't think he's got the stones,

33:04.565 --> 33:06.401
but Garibaldi was playing that horse room.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.277
Maybe he takes us to somebody.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.862
I'll get a couple Division guys.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.242
Look, before I tell you,

33:14.325 --> 33:16.786
I'm just asking you to understand.

33:17.620 --> 33:21.290
I really was doing it for us
so we could keep going.

33:21.374 --> 33:24.168
-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Tell him.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.254
-Hey, listen. Are you warm enough?
-Now, coach!

33:27.088 --> 33:28.506
Just tell me what?

33:30.174 --> 33:31.217
I got a criminal record.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.761
Your coach faked the robbery
this morning, Mr. Geaseland.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.263
He took the money himself.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.017
Is this a joke?

33:40.226 --> 33:41.185
No joke.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.730
Now, sir, you can fill out
a complaint right here.

33:43.813 --> 33:47.066
We'll take this <i>coach </i>back
to Hill Street station,

33:47.150 --> 33:48.276
and we'll book him.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.532
Well, what if I don't make a complaint?

33:54.615 --> 33:57.452
They'll let the false report go.
Then we can keep moving.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.287
We can keep moving.

34:01.748 --> 34:04.125
-For crying out loud, Jerry!
-Matt?

34:07.670 --> 34:10.673
Do you know how much it hurts me
to have to run every day?

34:10.757 --> 34:11.883
I know. I know.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.093
Were you even gonna tell me

34:14.177 --> 34:16.012
or were you just gonna keep the money?

34:16.095 --> 34:18.306
Hey! Hey, that hurts.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.683
No, I want to know.
Were you gonna keep the money?

34:20.767 --> 34:23.227
I don't know. I'm so full of crap.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.396
(sighs)

34:26.439 --> 34:29.192
I mean,
but I think I was gonna give it back.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.276
I think.

34:31.611 --> 34:34.030
I mean, but we all kid ourselves
a little bit, right, Matt?

34:34.572 --> 34:36.532
I mean,
we all fib to ourselves a little, right?

34:36.616 --> 34:37.909
So we can keep going.

34:40.161 --> 34:41.454
What are you trying to say?

34:41.537 --> 34:44.165
I want to keep going with you.

34:44.707 --> 34:47.293
Let me keep going with you, please?

34:47.376 --> 34:48.586
Please.

34:53.800 --> 34:54.801
I want you to.

34:54.884 --> 34:59.680
(laughs) Great! Hey, he wants me to stay!
He wants me to keep going with him.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.724
-Let me keep going with him.
-So get going.

35:01.808 --> 35:02.809
Go ahead.

35:02.892 --> 35:05.061
(chuckles) Come on. Come on.

35:05.144 --> 35:08.189
You want to ride in the van, huh? Huh?

35:08.272 --> 35:10.691
We'll be fighting rush hour
in a minute or two here.

35:10.775 --> 35:14.320
No, I just want to run.
How many miles we gotta go?

35:14.403 --> 35:15.988
We got four miles, then the hotel.

35:16.072 --> 35:17.990
Listen, you run ahead.
I'll be right with you.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.409
-I'm right behind you!
-WOMAN: Let's go!

35:21.202 --> 35:22.912
So you haven't seen him too much.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.665
No, not in the last few months.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.293
We try to get together after work.

35:29.377 --> 35:31.838
I haven't been in touch too much either.

35:31.921 --> 35:34.423
I think, well, he was mad at me.

35:35.133 --> 35:38.052
I got upset. He left law school, and…

35:39.011 --> 35:39.971
it's his own life.

35:40.054 --> 35:41.848
He should do what makes him happy.

35:43.391 --> 35:46.602
He was always a very ambitious boy.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.021
Mr. Garibaldi?

35:51.274 --> 35:53.276
Dr. Kaplan, hospital administration.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.821
Have you had a chance
to consider those forms?

35:56.904 --> 35:59.031
I'm sorry. I've tried to decide.

36:00.158 --> 36:03.703
-Are there questions you want to ask me?
-Would you rather not talk about this now?

36:04.704 --> 36:06.455
You wouldn't do it till there's no chance.

36:06.539 --> 36:10.168
No, there's a short time
after the brain isn't working anymore

36:10.251 --> 36:12.003
when other organs are still salvageable.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.131
If they will help someone.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.049
That's a generous decision, sir.

36:28.060 --> 36:29.270
Thank you, sir.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.608
He was always helping somebody.

36:34.817 --> 36:37.695
He was always a good boy.

36:38.905 --> 36:40.907
He had the sweetest smile I've ever seen.

36:40.990 --> 36:44.744
(chuckles) His smile could
light up a room.

36:47.205 --> 36:51.709
That's why I want to kill
the bastard that did this to him.

36:57.840 --> 36:59.842
(horns honking)

36:59.926 --> 37:02.637
I still got the car.
What the hell's going on?

37:02.720 --> 37:04.597
MAN (over radio): <i>He's not in here!</i>

37:04.680 --> 37:06.599
-What?
-<i>He's not in here.</i>

37:06.682 --> 37:09.101
<i>We're in Sedita's apartment!</i>
<i>He's not in here!</i>

37:10.728 --> 37:11.896
We lost him.

37:12.813 --> 37:14.190
<i>Check the alley!</i>

37:16.025 --> 37:17.944
I'm checking the alley, but we lost him.

37:19.070 --> 37:20.529
(tires squeal)

37:24.033 --> 37:26.202
I don't like that new lieutenant much.

37:26.285 --> 37:30.331
Buntz? He has a sort
of simian congeniality.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.584
Well, he was making some
wisecracks about your friend.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.128
What sort of wisecracks?

37:37.505 --> 37:40.341
I'd rather not be specific, sir.

37:42.677 --> 37:43.803
I see.

37:49.141 --> 37:50.476
Lieutenant Buntz?

37:50.559 --> 37:52.019
Yeah. How you doing?

37:52.728 --> 37:54.355
I understand you were disparaging

37:54.438 --> 37:55.856
my companion this morning.

37:55.940 --> 37:59.360
-Now, don't get up in arms, Lieutenant.
-I'm not up in arms.

37:59.443 --> 38:01.445
What is it that you said about Maura?

38:01.529 --> 38:03.823
What, are we gonna duke it out here?

38:03.906 --> 38:05.825
Unless you can explain yourself.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.121
Look, Lieutenant, all I said was

38:10.204 --> 38:14.083
this Maura looked
an awful lot like a Maurice

38:14.166 --> 38:16.335
we used to pop for soliciting
when I was at heights.

38:19.922 --> 38:20.840
You mean?

38:20.923 --> 38:23.843
Hey, there's no crime
in being fooled, Lieutenant.

38:23.926 --> 38:25.344
I mean, my guess, uh,

38:25.428 --> 38:27.596
Maura never let you
check out her equipment.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.353
Excuse me.

38:40.151 --> 38:42.903
-Maybe it's his sister.
-Frank!

38:43.696 --> 38:44.905
How was lunch with Leigh?

38:44.989 --> 38:47.700
I was on the ropes early.
I rallied during dessert.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.661
Leigh was saying if I'm gonna be counsel,

38:50.745 --> 38:52.955
-she thinks I should get some recognition.
-I agree.

38:53.039 --> 38:56.042
She said maybe there could be
a release about my being appointed.

38:56.125 --> 38:58.377
I'll talk to Daniels' press people.
Thank you, Irwin.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.129
If they're crooked, let's catch them.

39:02.923 --> 39:05.718
This is Lieutenant Hunter, Hill Street,

39:05.801 --> 39:06.802
and I--

39:11.098 --> 39:12.725
Sorry, I was wondering

39:12.808 --> 39:15.269
if you could punch up a name check for me.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.520
(locker door closes)

39:16.604 --> 39:18.522
Good, first name, Maurice.

39:18.606 --> 39:22.068
Last name, try Sharpenteer.

39:22.777 --> 39:25.529
(indistinct conversations)

39:25.613 --> 39:26.947
No Sharpenteer?

39:28.199 --> 39:29.200
Figures.

39:29.283 --> 39:31.744
Um, what about Carpenter?

39:34.914 --> 39:35.956
No Carpenter.

39:37.333 --> 39:40.378
Well, I'm sorry.
Sharpenteer was all they gave me.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.881
Well, I understand if I had prints,
but I don't have prints.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.426
(sighs) Thank you, Detective.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.854
I don't know what Buntz' game is, sir,

39:58.938 --> 40:00.940
but Maura is a beautiful woman.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.655
Thank you, Ballantine.

40:08.823 --> 40:12.410
(siren wailing)

40:19.542 --> 40:21.669
-How did they lose him?
-Happens, babe.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.129
We should have tailed him.

40:23.212 --> 40:25.965
We just spent three hours
in the same room with the guy, J.D.

40:26.048 --> 40:27.883
I'm telling you what we should have done.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.638
Knife, just like Garibaldi.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.724
Whoever did it must have figured
Sedita was talking to us.

40:35.808 --> 40:36.892
Sorry, guys.

40:37.518 --> 40:39.061
We didn't want to get too close.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.149
(sighs)

40:51.657 --> 40:54.618
-Hi, Patsy.
-Captain. Ms. Davenport.

40:54.702 --> 40:57.288
-Detective.
-My wife, Joyce Davenport.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.539
How do you do?

40:59.123 --> 41:01.500
Any progress in solving it, Captain?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.377
We're following some leads.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.546
It's probably very hard
with something like this

41:05.629 --> 41:08.507
where it's just unprovoked
and out of the blue.

41:13.095 --> 41:14.180
Doctor?

41:15.139 --> 41:16.599
I'm sorry.

41:16.682 --> 41:17.892
He's gone.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.771
(dramatic music playing)

41:25.399 --> 41:27.860
(gasping) Thank you for staying with me.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.236
I'm sorry.

41:32.531 --> 41:34.492
I'm so glad his mother didn't live.

41:36.911 --> 41:39.413
(voice breaking)
She loved him so very much.

41:40.456 --> 41:42.791
(crying)

41:58.265 --> 41:59.350
Thanks.

42:00.893 --> 42:01.810
(sighs)

42:02.811 --> 42:04.188
That's 12.

42:04.271 --> 42:05.439
Twelve what?

42:05.523 --> 42:06.982
Twelve sighs.

42:08.734 --> 42:11.362
I'm trying to plan our expenses,
you know, a budget.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.822
Now we gotta figure in a replacement car.

42:14.448 --> 42:15.533
I know.

42:15.616 --> 42:17.701
I've started thinking about the changes.

42:20.371 --> 42:21.664
But I'm still excited.

42:23.499 --> 42:26.252
We gotta make sure we do everything right.

42:30.256 --> 42:32.216
Can we make a promise to each other?

42:32.883 --> 42:33.884
Hmm.

42:34.468 --> 42:38.222
I mean, we are who we are,
but as much as we can,

42:38.305 --> 42:41.600
can we try and share
what's going on inside?

42:42.851 --> 42:44.562
I mean, what we're feeling.

42:50.985 --> 42:53.237
Well, like, I'm a little afraid right now.

42:56.323 --> 42:59.702
I am a little, too,
but I am still very happy.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.745
I am, too.

43:03.998 --> 43:06.083
(sighs)

43:06.166 --> 43:08.294
(door unlocks, opens)

43:14.174 --> 43:15.634
(gasps) Oh!

43:17.386 --> 43:18.387
I frightened you.

43:18.470 --> 43:20.931
Yeah. Of course.

43:21.015 --> 43:23.475
Admittedly, entering as I did
is a wrong thing to do.

43:23.559 --> 43:26.395
Behaviorally,
it's a throwback to a period of my life

43:26.478 --> 43:31.817
when surprise,
deception was an element of survival.

43:35.571 --> 43:36.447
You seem uneasy.

43:37.990 --> 43:40.492
Well, I like to think that
I know you, Howard.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.954
Yeah, but one can never be sure.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.834
No, I suppose not.

43:51.962 --> 43:53.213
(clears throat)

43:54.214 --> 43:55.507
That's my problem.

43:57.593 --> 44:00.054
I'm not sure of you.

44:01.347 --> 44:03.098
What would you like to be sure about?

44:03.849 --> 44:06.060
I've told you how I feel.
Do you think I've lied?

44:06.143 --> 44:08.520
No, no, I don't think you've lied.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.230
Then what's left? What else matters?

44:10.314 --> 44:11.940
Well, we've only made one kind of love.

44:12.024 --> 44:14.902
-And didn't I satisfy you?
-Yes, you did, but…

44:17.363 --> 44:19.448
It's been suggested that, uh,

44:20.240 --> 44:23.077
you might not be totally, uh...

44:24.620 --> 44:25.579
genuine.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.083
(sighs)

44:29.708 --> 44:31.710
That I might not be female?

44:33.170 --> 44:34.171
(chuckles softly)

44:35.839 --> 44:38.008
You could examine me, Howard,

44:38.092 --> 44:41.136
and you would find that
anatomically, I'm a woman.

44:43.013 --> 44:44.431
But that wasn't always so.

44:48.018 --> 44:49.645
I had an operation.

44:49.728 --> 44:50.729
Before that, I…

44:52.648 --> 44:55.025
I was a very unhappy person.

45:01.532 --> 45:02.783
Oh, God.

45:05.911 --> 45:06.912
You deceived me.

45:08.038 --> 45:08.997
How?

45:10.791 --> 45:14.336
By not revealing everything
that I am or ever was?

45:14.420 --> 45:16.463
Have you revealed that, Howard?

45:18.590 --> 45:19.758
Oh, Howard.

45:20.843 --> 45:21.969
(chuckles)

45:26.265 --> 45:28.142
Don't you want to hold me?

45:31.979 --> 45:33.397
I can't. I...

45:34.690 --> 45:36.400
I can't even touch you. I'm afraid.

45:36.483 --> 45:38.444
(chuckles) You're afraid of me?

45:38.527 --> 45:40.279
I'm afraid of what I might do.

45:45.075 --> 45:46.702
Well, I guess you'd better go.

45:47.327 --> 45:49.329
Oh, yes.

45:49.413 --> 45:51.165
Yes, I'm going.

45:52.875 --> 45:53.792
Howard?

45:56.462 --> 45:59.006
If there ever comes a time
when you're not afraid,

45:59.715 --> 46:00.549
come back?

46:03.427 --> 46:04.511
(door closes)

46:06.680 --> 46:08.932
It was just bad police work.

46:09.016 --> 46:11.518
-Come on. Let yourself off.
-We didn't want to get too close.

46:11.602 --> 46:15.105
-We gave him too much slack.
-It was a 3-man tail, Lieutenant.

46:18.233 --> 46:19.359
Keep doing it.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.990
MAN: Let me buy you a drink. Hey, Lou.

46:25.073 --> 46:27.201
Lou, what you gotta do
around here to get a drink?

46:28.452 --> 46:29.578
Hi.

46:29.661 --> 46:30.746
Hi, Pats.

46:31.371 --> 46:32.831
Could I have a beer, please?

46:34.917 --> 46:36.126
You okay?

46:37.419 --> 46:39.004
I can't stop thinking about him.

46:40.172 --> 46:41.173
Don't try.

46:43.550 --> 46:45.511
You know, when I first met Harry,

46:47.429 --> 46:53.769
I thought, "Whoa.
Looks, brains, energy, charm."

46:56.897 --> 46:58.315
The guy had the whole package.

46:59.775 --> 47:01.860
Yeah, he came on
like a real wonder boy, didn't he?

47:02.694 --> 47:04.363
I don't know what beat him, Luce.

47:04.446 --> 47:06.907
-(glass shattering, banging)
-WOMAN: Hey!

47:11.578 --> 47:13.705
(sobbing) I knew he was in trouble!

47:14.581 --> 47:16.917
I knew he was scared and in trouble,

47:17.000 --> 47:19.002
and I didn't do anything!

47:19.086 --> 47:21.088
(sobbing) Ah!

47:21.171 --> 47:22.506
Ahh!

47:23.257 --> 47:27.719
-I'm not gonna get drunk!
-Come on. Come on.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.680
I'm not drinking!

47:29.763 --> 47:30.973
We're gonna get the guy, J.D.

47:41.984 --> 47:43.902
Yeah. Yeah.

47:43.986 --> 47:45.195

-Oh.
