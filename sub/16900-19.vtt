Hey, what's wrong with you?

00:15.015 --> 00:15.474
What?

00:15.641 --> 00:18.810
Your face-- it's like
you're happy or something.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.354
I am happy, Frank.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.064
'Cause of that dude you're donking.

00:22.231 --> 00:23.357
Floyd?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.066
Yes.

00:24.233 --> 00:27.194
He just gets me.

00:28.408 --> 00:29.900
I think you've got a little something--

00:30.074 --> 00:31.241
- Right here?
- Other side.

00:31.403 --> 00:33.038
- Here?
- Up a little.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.499
In that area?

00:34.669 --> 00:35.910
You got it.

00:36.076 --> 00:38.451
Ugh, that movie was
a complete waste of time.

00:38.627 --> 00:39.912
I thought it was moving...

00:40.085 --> 00:42.661
my bowels.

00:45.295 --> 00:48.753
Reverse, reverse,
skip, skip, draw four!

00:48.927 --> 00:51.051
- Oh, hell no!
- Ha ha!

00:51.216 --> 00:52.633
That's awesome, Liz.

00:52.807 --> 00:55.591
I'm really happy that
you found someone to care about.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.262
Because relationships are hard.

00:57.436 --> 01:00.761
So if you ever need someone
to come over and videotape you guys doing it,

01:00.938 --> 01:04.181
or whatever,
I can make room in my schedule.

01:04.357 --> 01:07.353
- Thanks, Frank.
- You're welcome.

01:07.528 --> 01:10.152
No judgments.

01:10.327 --> 01:10.983
Don.

01:11.158 --> 01:13.363
Jack, you old dog, how are you?

01:13.538 --> 01:15.282
- I'm good, sir.
- Of course you are.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.951
Look at those eyes,
sharp, like a panther's.

01:18.125 --> 01:18.951
Thank you, sir--
would you like to sit down?

01:19.127 --> 01:19.872
I can't.

01:20.037 --> 01:24.201
I took my grandkids snorkeling at St. Bart's,
and got stung by a jellyfish.

01:24.376 --> 01:27.672
I got a welt on my ass
the size of a Red Delicious apple.

01:27.836 --> 01:28.790
I'm very sorry to hear that, sir.

01:28.965 --> 01:29.502
Yeah.

01:29.677 --> 01:33.090
Boy, Jack...
you really terrified the people

01:33.265 --> 01:37.473
with that fireworks special of yours.

01:39.605 --> 01:43.180
Well, we were trying for something dramatic,
and I don't regret trying.

01:43.355 --> 01:44.350
Well, you gotta try.

01:44.528 --> 01:48.602
As my old man always said,
If you try, you win.

01:48.778 --> 01:52.360
And he was a hell of a garbage man.

01:52.525 --> 01:56.820
I just want you to know we all still
have a lot of faith in you, Jack.

01:56.995 --> 01:57.740
Well, thank you, sir.

01:57.915 --> 01:59.070
That means the world coming from you.

01:59.247 --> 02:03.450
But I'm taking the microwave
division away from you.

02:03.627 --> 02:05.911
I mean, you're in the rough, Jack.

02:06.088 --> 02:08.793
You gotta get back on the fairway.

02:08.966 --> 02:10.711
Yes, sir.

02:10.884 --> 02:12.632
You ever think about getting remarried?

02:12.796 --> 02:15.092
Well, I just got divorced, sir.

02:15.265 --> 02:18.723
Everyone in this division
is married except you.

02:18.886 --> 02:19.893
Look at Bob.

02:20.058 --> 02:24.811
His wife looks just like Walter Matthau,
but she's always there for him.

02:24.976 --> 02:28.523
That's the kind of companion you need.

02:28.695 --> 02:30.730
Think about that.

02:30.906 --> 02:33.022
I will, sir.

02:33.195 --> 02:34.731
I'm going to see Tracy Jordan.

02:34.908 --> 02:35.860
He is funny.

02:36.035 --> 02:37.992
What's that film where he turned into a dog?

02:38.157 --> 02:39.860
Uh, Fat Bitch, sir.

02:40.037 --> 02:41.113
That's it-- I love it.

02:41.288 --> 02:44.793
Boy, that's a great film.

02:52.927 --> 02:56.420
I'm sorry I let you down.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.074
Learn the unknown English words
of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

03:18.498 --> 03:20.532
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me, Don Geiss.

03:20.707 --> 03:23.203
Would you like some Grenadine
or some fried rice?

03:23.378 --> 03:24.661
I'm good, thanks.

03:24.836 --> 03:30.081
Sir, I have a movie project
that is going to blow your mind.

03:30.256 --> 03:32.791
I call it Jefferson.

03:32.965 --> 03:36.043
A movie version of The Jeffersons?
I love it.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.090
No, Thomas Jefferson.

03:38.266 --> 03:43.341
I just recently found out that he went to
town on one of my ancestors, so we're related.

03:43.518 --> 03:44.890
You want to play Thomas Jefferson?

03:45.056 --> 03:47.311
And Sally Hemings, and King George.

03:47.477 --> 03:48.852
I'm going to play all the parts.

03:49.026 --> 03:50.600
Did you know he had a lisp?

03:50.776 --> 03:55.690
Whath's up, sthupid jerks?
I'm Thomas Jefferthon.

03:55.988 --> 04:00.901
So we're gonna need about 35 million
to do this thing right.

04:01.075 --> 04:02.571
I'm gonna get us one of those big clocks.

04:02.746 --> 04:03.660
We could hang it in there.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.451
Sorry I'm late.

04:04.627 --> 04:07.872
Aw, Lutz, that's okay.
I'm just glad you're here.

04:08.048 --> 04:11.410
Oh, you've got a face
like a baby's bottom!

04:11.588 --> 04:13.582
Boop.

04:13.756 --> 04:16.959
I hate when you're in a good mood.
It makes me feel unsafe.

04:17.137 --> 04:20.921
Like when my mom used to make daiquiris
and sing Tanya Tucker songs.

04:21.096 --> 04:21.882
That sounds awesome.

04:22.057 --> 04:23.510
Miss Lemon, Mr. Donaghy
would like to see you.

04:23.685 --> 04:26.050
He's across the street
at Christie's auction house.

04:26.227 --> 04:27.101
Oh, brother.

04:27.266 --> 04:27.932
What's this?

04:28.106 --> 04:31.773
Jack goes to Sbarro when he's angry,
the New York Stock Exchange when he's horny,

04:31.937 --> 04:34.693
and Christie's auction house
when he's depressed.

04:34.857 --> 04:37.693
He said he needs you immediately.

04:37.868 --> 04:42.783
Yeah... that's the Liz face
I'm comfortable with.

04:49.205 --> 04:50.742
You've been avoiding me, Lemon.

04:50.917 --> 04:53.790
How do you do that without turning around?

04:53.965 --> 04:58.002
To be perfectly honest, the first couple of
people I did that to were not you.

04:58.175 --> 05:00.170
But... here we are.

05:00.346 --> 05:01.300
Mr. Donaghy.

05:01.466 --> 05:02.630
Hi, you probably don't remember me.

05:02.805 --> 05:03.802
I'm Phoebe.

05:03.977 --> 05:06.973
I handled the sale of your ex-wife's
jewelry to an anonymous Arab.

05:07.146 --> 05:08.473
Oh, yes, of course.

05:08.646 --> 05:10.932
Those were such lovely pieces.

05:11.107 --> 05:13.562
The ruby and diamond cluster ring
was particularly exquisite.

05:13.737 --> 05:15.313
That was her engagement ring.

05:15.485 --> 05:17.813
You know, I took the money
from the sale of those pieces,

05:17.985 --> 05:23.533
and I bought a sailboat, and I named it
after my ex-wife, and I sank it.

05:23.695 --> 05:24.032
It's true.

05:24.196 --> 05:28.740
The Bianca Blows is somewhere
at the bottom of the Peconic Bay.

05:28.917 --> 05:31.290
If there's anything I can show you,
please do let me know.

05:31.455 --> 05:32.743
Okay?

05:32.918 --> 05:35.210
Yeah.

05:36.678 --> 05:40.212
I really do like these equestrian paintings.

05:40.387 --> 05:43.210
Isn't that magnificent?

05:43.386 --> 05:44.721
Sometimes I wish I were a horse.

05:44.887 --> 05:47.053
Strong, free.

05:47.226 --> 05:50.393
My chestnut haunches glistening in the sun.

05:50.557 --> 05:51.563
Are you okay?

05:51.725 --> 05:53.561
Hmm? Oh, yeah, sure.

05:53.727 --> 05:56.022
You know, I'm really sorry
that I let you down.

05:56.198 --> 05:57.232
You should be.

05:57.396 --> 05:59.480
My special was a disaster.

05:59.658 --> 06:02.860
I wouldn't say that.

06:04.407 --> 06:05.940
You left me dangling, Lemon.

06:06.115 --> 06:10.912
I'm not a creative type like you, with
your work sneakers and your left-handedness.

06:11.077 --> 06:12.700
I can't do what you do.

06:12.875 --> 06:13.952
I know, I dropped the ball.

06:14.126 --> 06:16.793
I was just trying to do what you said,
and have a personal life.

06:16.968 --> 06:19.123
And I guess I got caught up
with this new guy.

06:19.298 --> 06:20.423
Oh, right, flower guy.

06:20.586 --> 06:21.840
His name is Floyd.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.502
That's unfortunate.

06:23.676 --> 06:24.962
I'd really like you to meet him, Jack.

06:25.135 --> 06:25.961
Fine.

06:26.138 --> 06:29.553
I'd like to meet the man that made
Liz Lemon shirk her responsibilities.

06:29.725 --> 06:33.430
Let's say Persil, 9:00.
Be sure to wear a tie.

06:33.607 --> 06:37.102
Are you sure you're okay?

06:40.988 --> 06:42.691
I pitched my Jefferson movie to Don Geiss.

06:42.867 --> 06:43.730
He said no.

06:43.908 --> 06:46.573
He said people only see
movies because of the previews,

06:46.745 --> 06:49.110
and he couldn't visualize my Jefferson preview.

06:49.304 --> 06:51.661
He wants me to do Fat Bitch 2 instead.

06:51.823 --> 06:53.498
Well, that doesn't even make sense.

06:53.661 --> 06:56.299
Everyone knows Fat Bitch died at the end.

06:56.459 --> 06:58.872
It's not the kind of stuff
I want to do anymore, Ken.

06:59.046 --> 07:00.792
I want to be taken seriously.

07:00.967 --> 07:01.830
What should I do?

07:02.008 --> 07:05.422
Well, remember when Fat Bitch called
all her dog friends together,

07:05.596 --> 07:07.513
and they used their high-pitched
howling to mess up the--

07:07.677 --> 07:08.761
You're right, K.

07:08.925 --> 07:14.810
I should make my own Jefferson preview,
and show it to Don Geiss.

07:15.015 --> 07:20.481
I'm never gonna finish this bikini
before Nana's birthday.

07:20.698 --> 07:22.351
Hey, Liz Lemon, where you going?

07:22.527 --> 07:23.061
Uh, home.

07:23.236 --> 07:24.440
I gotta go get ready
for a dinner with Jack.

07:24.616 --> 07:27.861
Listen, I'm gonna need to make a fake
trailer for my Jefferson film.

07:28.038 --> 07:31.363
I'm gonna need the entire resources
of the show for no more than three weeks.

07:31.536 --> 07:32.493
You in?

07:32.665 --> 07:33.741
No-what? No.

07:33.916 --> 07:34.580
Tracy, you're not doing that.

07:34.746 --> 07:35.831
We have a show on Friday.

07:35.997 --> 07:38.371
Liz Lemon, you are my Alexander Hamilton.

07:38.547 --> 07:41.170
I don't know what that means.

07:41.337 --> 07:45.382
Writers, listen.
I need your help.

07:46.137 --> 07:47.881
Well, I hope this isn't too boring for you.

07:48.055 --> 07:48.963
Are you kidding?

07:49.135 --> 07:50.091
Jack Donaghy's a legend.

07:50.268 --> 07:51.680
I've read his book, like, 20 times.

07:51.848 --> 07:53.263
- Jack wrote a book?
- Yeah.

07:53.435 --> 07:56.223
Jack Attack:
The Art of Aggression in Business.

07:56.397 --> 07:58.143
Oh, no.

07:58.316 --> 07:59.932
He got here before us.

08:00.105 --> 08:05.112
You're not supposed to let that happen.
That's chapter two in the book.

08:05.278 --> 08:06.573
Hi, Jack.

08:06.735 --> 08:07.903
This is Floyd.

08:08.078 --> 08:09.361
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

08:09.536 --> 08:11.321
Well, you're Floyd.

08:11.495 --> 08:15.371
The only other Floyd I ever knew
was this Korean barber who used to cut my hair

08:15.537 --> 08:17.623
down in the 50th Street subway station.

08:17.785 --> 08:18.702
That's my dad.

08:18.876 --> 08:21.711
I'm Floyd, Jr.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.172
I-I'm just kidding.

08:23.336 --> 08:25.213
Well, please.

08:25.388 --> 08:26.461
Sorry.

08:26.635 --> 08:29.051
I'm just nervous to meet the head
of east coast television

08:29.218 --> 08:31.052
and microwave oven programming.

08:31.226 --> 08:34.432
I just got the word from Geiss
they're taking me off microwave.

08:34.597 --> 08:37.511
Oh, no. Really?

08:38.068 --> 08:43.022
Mr. Donaghy, with all due respect to Mr. Geiss,
I gotta say he's making a terrible mistake.

08:43.197 --> 08:47.111
This company's stability in the small-appliance
market is in large part your doing.

08:47.276 --> 08:52.651
The dedicated popcorn setting on your microwave
was the imagination breakthrough of 1995.

08:52.826 --> 08:58.741
In 2002, you increased corporate earnings by 3%,
while the country suffered through a recession.

08:58.917 --> 09:02.163
And Attack of the Clones, which was
seriously the worst of the Star Wars--

09:02.338 --> 09:04.333
One sec, Liz, one sec.

09:04.506 --> 09:08.340
And on a personal note, sir, in my mind,
the Foo Fighters' song Best of You

09:08.506 --> 09:12.421
is about your managerial skills.

09:14.135 --> 09:16.090
Lemon, I want to kiss your
boyfriend on the mouth.

09:16.268 --> 09:18.932
Chapter 12.

09:19.856 --> 09:20.683
I thought you were gonna do it.

09:20.855 --> 09:21.771
What are you drinking?

09:21.936 --> 09:23.392
- Club soda.
- Oh, that's a shame.

09:23.568 --> 09:25.850
Pete!

09:28.317 --> 09:29.232
Hey, Liz Lemon.

09:29.407 --> 09:30.730
Could you go away for a while?

09:30.905 --> 09:32.863
I gotta get rid of Freddie's erection.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.151
Explain what is happening here.

09:35.327 --> 09:38.703
Freddie is playing the part
of Thomas Jefferson's horse Caractacus.

09:38.877 --> 09:41.333
We needed a place to keep him
till we shoot his stunts.

09:41.495 --> 09:43.662
No, Tracy, I told you not to do this.

09:43.838 --> 09:45.463
Jack said I could.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.251
This movie is my destiny.

09:47.428 --> 09:49.632
It's the reason why God put me on this earth.

09:49.795 --> 09:52.550
I'll take you off this earth.

09:52.718 --> 09:56.433
The overwhelming violence of the subject
matter is in deliberate juxtaposition

09:56.595 --> 09:59.262
with the pastoral beauty of the terrain.

09:59.437 --> 10:01.680
Jack, Tracy put a horse in my office.

10:01.857 --> 10:04.601
- Lemon, you've met--
- Hello.

10:04.776 --> 10:06.521
You probably don't remember me--I'm Phoebe.

10:06.696 --> 10:07.350
We met the other day.

10:07.528 --> 10:08.150
Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.771
- I'm Liz.
- Oh, sorry.

10:09.946 --> 10:10.860
I don't shake hands.

10:11.025 --> 10:12.901
I have Avian Bone Syndrome.

10:13.075 --> 10:14.363
Oh, boy, okay.

10:14.536 --> 10:15.571
Hollow bones.

10:15.748 --> 10:17.110
Lemon, I want your opinion.

10:17.286 --> 10:19.622
Which of these two do you like?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.282
They're both beautiful.

10:21.457 --> 10:24.291
They look just like
the one crapping in my office.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.961
Did you tell Tracy he could use the crew
to make a trailer for his crazy movie?

10:28.126 --> 10:29.830
Yes. How's Floyd?

10:30.005 --> 10:31.082
What? he's fine.

10:31.258 --> 10:32.292
You know, I called him earlier.

10:32.468 --> 10:33.673
We had a very nice chat--
did he mention that?

10:33.845 --> 10:35.802
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, he will.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.342
He's a good man, the Floydster.

10:37.516 --> 10:38.683
Oh, "the Floydster."

10:38.846 --> 10:40.642
Don't give him a nickname before I do.

10:40.805 --> 10:43.260
Um...the white horse.

10:43.506 --> 10:44.471
I was wondering if--

10:44.647 --> 10:45.181
[whispering] Did I hurt you?

10:45.357 --> 10:48.143
Just a little bit, but that's okay.

10:48.317 --> 10:51.902
Yes, the white horse, it's--

10:52.065 --> 10:53.522
Yo, Trey, we got a problem.

10:53.696 --> 10:57.153
Pray, who be this Tracy Jordan
thou speakest of?

10:57.326 --> 11:00.202
Uh, President Jefferson,
we got a problem.

11:00.365 --> 11:01.570
Speakest.

11:01.747 --> 11:02.952
That horse ate your wig.

11:03.127 --> 11:07.001
Well, stand guard by his rump,
and await it in his droppings.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.463
Or we could probably
just go get a new wig.

11:09.627 --> 11:11.422
I like you, young man.

11:11.586 --> 11:14.713
You shall run my university.

11:14.887 --> 11:15.712
Yeah, yeah.

11:15.887 --> 11:16.801
No, it's very nice.

11:16.966 --> 11:18.760
Hey, what are you doing here, Jack?

11:18.927 --> 11:20.681
Jack bought me this painting.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.102
Wow. Um...

11:23.268 --> 11:26.310
Is that lion eating the horse?

11:26.475 --> 11:29.892
Or perhaps it's eating universal health care.

11:30.067 --> 11:32.941
I bought this for the Floydster
to congratulate him on his promotion.

11:33.116 --> 11:34.823
Well, it's not a sure thing.

11:34.988 --> 11:37.821
I didn't know you were up for a promotion.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.112
We should go celebrate.

11:39.287 --> 11:40.153
I'm free for lunch.

11:40.326 --> 11:41.283
Do you want to grab a burger, or--

11:41.457 --> 11:44.162
Shoot, I just said
I'd go to lunch with Jack.

11:44.327 --> 11:47.661
- Oh.
- Why don't you join us?

11:47.837 --> 11:48.910
Would that be okay?

11:49.085 --> 11:50.122
Yeah, I guess so.

11:50.295 --> 11:52.333
Sure.

11:52.506 --> 11:56.552
It's kind of like you two are dating.

11:56.718 --> 12:01.632
Um, I think that Coulter
was right about Edwards.

12:03.938 --> 12:04.970
So where's Pete?

12:05.148 --> 12:08.101
He took his kids
to that Russian cat circus.

12:08.278 --> 12:09.142
Wow.

12:09.316 --> 12:10.353
You are bringin' it.

12:10.527 --> 12:13.062
Yeah, you like that?

12:13.235 --> 12:14.272
Mmm.

12:14.446 --> 12:16.610
It's got pockets--
are you into that?

12:16.778 --> 12:17.770
Ooh, what's this?

12:17.948 --> 12:19.150
A used Kleenex.

12:19.325 --> 12:20.742
I feel like I'm in a rap video.

12:20.908 --> 12:23.611
Wait, let me turn on my humidifier.

12:23.785 --> 12:24.413
Yeah.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.033
Uh-oh.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.832
It's so dry in here.

12:27.996 --> 12:30.253
I really don't know
how much more of this I can take.

12:30.415 --> 12:32.160
Unh, unh...

12:32.336 --> 12:33.963
Unh, unh. Yeah.

12:34.127 --> 12:35.500
Old school, Kid 'n Play.

12:35.675 --> 12:36.293
Here we go.

12:36.465 --> 12:37.213
That's not that impressive.

12:37.386 --> 12:39.550
That's Davy Jones.

12:39.715 --> 12:40.963
Hey, it's Jack.

12:41.137 --> 12:42.381
Jack-- what does he want?

12:42.557 --> 12:44.052
He's just saying hi.

12:44.225 --> 12:45.892
Oh, he wants to meet
at that diner on 71st.

12:46.055 --> 12:47.472
Get a veggie burger and a milkshake.

12:47.647 --> 12:48.350
You wanna go?

12:48.517 --> 12:49.723
It's midnight.

12:49.896 --> 12:51.140
Yeah, we don't have to go.

12:51.315 --> 12:52.890
There, done.

12:53.068 --> 12:59.023
Good, 'cause this VapoRub isn't gonna get
under my nose by itself.

13:00.536 --> 13:02.692
He says goodnight.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.202
And "sleep tight."

13:05.367 --> 13:06.281
"And don't let the bed--"

13:06.457 --> 13:08.083
All right, enough. Gimme that.

13:08.245 --> 13:14.582
"Jack, I have taken a sleeping pill
because I have a big lawyer meeting..."

13:14.756 --> 13:15.251
That's what we call 'em.

13:15.425 --> 13:17.080
"in the morning.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.671
Floyd."

13:21.806 --> 13:23.803
"Lemon, is that you?"

13:23.976 --> 13:27.590
I always sign it Floydster.

13:30.315 --> 13:31.313
It's Jack!

13:31.478 --> 13:34.431
Don't answer it.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.072
Oh, my God!

13:48.208 --> 13:48.990
Can he see us?

13:49.165 --> 13:51.952
The call is coming from inside the house!

13:52.125 --> 13:56.040
Turn of the lights and get down.

14:01.178 --> 14:03.460
Jonathan, I want to talk to Jack right now.

14:03.637 --> 14:04.633
He's at Christie's.

14:04.908 --> 14:07.551
But he left these for you.

14:07.726 --> 14:08.392
What's this?

14:08.557 --> 14:11.391
Tickets for you and Floyd
for tonight's Knicks game.

14:11.565 --> 14:12.473
For me and Floyd?

14:12.646 --> 14:14.431
He tried to drop them off
at your house last night,

14:14.606 --> 14:17.230
but someone pretended not to be home.

14:17.396 --> 14:19.560
Oh.

14:19.945 --> 14:21.273
This is really nice.

14:21.448 --> 14:25.611
Yes, he seems very taken with Floyd.

14:25.828 --> 14:28.952
And you, of course.

14:33.456 --> 14:35.083
- Are these good seats?
- Yeah.

14:35.258 --> 14:38.921
It's actually a private box.

14:43.557 --> 14:45.763
Hey, guys.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.633
Mr. Geiss, I know we disagreed
on my next movie project,

14:48.805 --> 14:53.393
but I hope this willchange
I give you this.

14:58.897 --> 15:01.612
Ah... hoe that dirt.

15:01.778 --> 15:04.193
Put your back into it.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.152
Mr. Jefferson, the British have invaded.

15:06.325 --> 15:08.201
Ah, bring me my horse!

15:08.366 --> 15:11.572
Bring me Caractacus!

15:11.918 --> 15:12.821
You come along.

15:12.997 --> 15:15.082
In a world without hope...

15:15.248 --> 15:20.373
Who are these Americans with their
ridiculous ideas of freedom and equalities?

15:20.547 --> 15:25.552
One man would declare
his independence for us all.

15:32.725 --> 15:34.971
Aah!

15:35.565 --> 15:38.892
Eat that, King George!

15:41.148 --> 15:44.480
I shall call it Susan!

15:45.525 --> 15:46.982
I'm with child.

15:47.158 --> 15:47.570
What?

15:47.738 --> 15:49.651
Free me and make me your wife.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.410
Um, I'll have to get back to you on that.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.831
Source Award nominee Tracy Jordan...

15:54.998 --> 15:56.870
Kill them!

15:57.045 --> 15:58.413
Kill them all!

15:58.588 --> 16:02.712
NAACP Image Award presenter Tracy Jordan...

16:02.885 --> 16:06.340
and Academy Award watcher Tracy Jordan is...

16:06.506 --> 16:08.763
This is for you, Don Geiss!

16:08.927 --> 16:09.553
Ha ha!

16:09.725 --> 16:11.181
Jefferson!

16:11.345 --> 16:13.553
Christmas, 2008.

16:13.728 --> 16:16.510
Get me off this horse.

16:16.685 --> 16:19.312
Well, Mr. Geiss, what do you think?

16:19.475 --> 16:21.690
Well, Tracy...

16:21.856 --> 16:23.232
that was terrible.

16:23.405 --> 16:26.401
The answer is no.

16:27.235 --> 16:30.992
Let's talk about Fat Bitch 2.

16:31.248 --> 16:32.990
So I'm bored,
and I sit next to Don Geiss,

16:33.165 --> 16:35.030
and I want to make a good impression,
so I bought four bottles

16:35.206 --> 16:37.621
of absolutely fantastic champagne.

16:37.786 --> 16:38.951
Lemon, you're gonna love this story.

16:39.126 --> 16:39.791
You told me this story, Jack.

16:39.955 --> 16:40.620
We're on our way to Tokyo,

16:40.798 --> 16:41.711
we're out over the ocean,

16:41.877 --> 16:43.253
and the cabin pressure drops.

16:43.428 --> 16:47.341
The masks are coming out of the ceiling,
and the corks are popping out of the champagne.

16:47.506 --> 16:50.881
And I don't give a damn about the masks,
I'm on all fours trying to shove the corks

16:51.057 --> 16:51.513
back in the bottle.

16:51.678 --> 16:52.590
And Don Geiss says,

16:52.768 --> 16:58.642
"Now, there's an executive
who knows how to keep his costs down!"

17:00.105 --> 17:02.892
That's great.

17:03.238 --> 17:04.352
I'm gonna get some more crab cakes.

17:04.527 --> 17:08.861
- Liz, you want anything?
- No, thanks.

17:10.657 --> 17:11.653
What are you doing?!

17:11.825 --> 17:14.362
I'm watching the ballgame
with you and the Floydster.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.992
But don't you kind of feel
like a third wheel, Jack?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.583
No, Lemon-- you're the third wheel.

17:19.747 --> 17:20.619
Excuse me?

17:20.796 --> 17:22.369
Well, it's really quite simple.

17:22.548 --> 17:26.250
Men seek out the company of other
men they admire and want to be like.

17:26.425 --> 17:27.751
Floyd is me 20 years ago.

17:27.928 --> 17:29.210
I'm Don Geiss 30 years ago.

17:29.388 --> 17:31.801
20 years from now, Floyd will be me,
I'm gonna be Don Geiss,

17:31.966 --> 17:33.720
and Don Geiss will be dead.

17:33.888 --> 17:34.842
Who thinks like that?

17:35.015 --> 17:35.723
Men do.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.432
That's why you're the third wheel.

17:37.595 --> 17:39.760
Just back off, okay?

17:39.938 --> 17:42.850
Lemon, are you telling me to stay away
from your boyfriend?

17:43.026 --> 17:45.773
Not that I blame you, because I could
take him away from you if I wanted to.

17:45.948 --> 17:46.983
This is my life, Jack.

17:47.155 --> 17:48.730
I know you're in a bad spot right now.

17:48.905 --> 17:51.690
But you can't use Floyd
to feel better about yourself.

17:51.867 --> 17:52.570
It's not fair.

17:52.735 --> 17:55.610
All right, how about
some kind of a time-share arrangement?

17:55.787 --> 17:56.740
You can have him Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday--

17:56.915 --> 17:58.743
I don't want Friday--
we have a show.

17:58.918 --> 18:01.120
Why am I even having
this conversation with you?!

18:01.295 --> 18:02.290
Look at your life, Jack.

18:02.458 --> 18:04.331
It's like this skybox.

18:04.505 --> 18:08.713
It's fancy and it's empty,
and it smells like crab cakes.

18:08.885 --> 18:13.630
Get your own Floyd,
because this one is taken.

18:17.186 --> 18:18.390
Oh, outstanding.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.141
Thank you.

18:24.817 --> 18:25.682
Sir?

18:25.856 --> 18:28.190
He said no.

18:28.357 --> 18:31.821
Then he offered me $7 million
to reprise my role as Cocoa the dog.

18:31.988 --> 18:33.440
* I'm gonna get an iPhone *

18:33.616 --> 18:35.241
* Everybody's gonna be jealous *

18:35.406 --> 18:37.700
No, I turned him down.

18:37.868 --> 18:39.821
It's like a roller-coaster
ride of emotion in here.

18:39.997 --> 18:42.531
Look, Thomas Jefferson
made his own country.

18:42.706 --> 18:44.040
I'm gonna make my own movie.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.001
Finance it myself, all on my terms.

18:46.166 --> 18:47.410
Now, who's with me?

18:47.586 --> 18:48.710
We all are, sir.

18:48.876 --> 18:49.832
Good, good, good.

18:50.006 --> 18:55.841
Now, first order of business,
get that dead horse out of my car.

18:56.768 --> 19:00.092
Well, I'm sorry your friend
wasn't pleased with the Stubbs.

19:00.267 --> 19:03.061
Yes, so am I.

19:03.317 --> 19:05.560
You seem very preoccupied.

19:05.726 --> 19:08.312
Well, it's just...

19:08.485 --> 19:10.351
people don't like fireworks anymore.

19:10.527 --> 19:11.233
Were you aware of that?

19:11.408 --> 19:12.650
They took away the microwave division.

19:12.816 --> 19:14.110
I'm having terrible Lemon problems.

19:14.277 --> 19:15.481
I'm eating all the time.

19:15.657 --> 19:17.490
I mean, who needs 16 flautas after midnight?

19:17.656 --> 19:20.491
Mr. Donaghy...

19:22.708 --> 19:24.993
Jack.

19:25.167 --> 19:29.000
Listen, if you're still interested,
there is another piece I'd like to show you

19:29.166 --> 19:31.330
that you might enjoy.

19:31.508 --> 19:34.343
I'll need to take you back
to the private office.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.212
This piece is very delicate.

19:37.385 --> 19:40.592
Very few people have handled it.

19:40.765 --> 19:45.813
Oh, God, I hope we're talking
about the same thing.

19:47.567 --> 19:48.433
May I speak with you?

19:48.606 --> 19:50.982
If this is about the other night,
I am not gonna apologize.

19:51.147 --> 19:52.440
- This whole Floyd thing--
- No, no, no.

19:52.605 --> 19:53.813
You're absolutely right.

19:53.987 --> 19:57.321
I have to make some changes in my life,
just like you have.

19:57.485 --> 20:01.320
Phoebe and I are seeing each other.

20:01.496 --> 20:02.493
Really?

20:02.667 --> 20:03.782
Wow, that's great.

20:03.957 --> 20:07.542
Now you have a Floydster,
and I have a Floydster.

20:07.708 --> 20:11.540
Well, I don't think Phoebe would appreciate
being referred to as a Floydster.

20:11.718 --> 20:13.543
But you like her?
You approve?

20:13.718 --> 20:15.342
- Of what?
- Of her for me.

20:15.507 --> 20:16.553
Yeah, sure.

20:16.718 --> 20:17.461
Good.

20:17.635 --> 20:18.713
Hello, I'm Phoebe.

20:18.885 --> 20:19.970
I don't know if you remember me, but--

20:20.138 --> 20:21.971
Yes, Phoebe, I remember you.

20:22.136 --> 20:23.013
Hi.

20:23.187 --> 20:26.050
May I ask you something?

20:26.227 --> 20:28.892
Uh, Phoebe,
I want you to be my wife.
