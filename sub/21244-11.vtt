00:00.420 --> 00:02.830
♪♪

00:04.540 --> 00:06.460
Previously...

00:06.460 --> 00:08.250
I figured out who's been sabotaging
all our missions. It's Brady.

00:08.250 --> 00:11.290
She can't know that you're a
spy and I'm your handler.

00:11.290 --> 00:13.710
The necklace he gave her;
I bet you he bugged it.

00:13.710 --> 00:16.830
The Organization developed this
new device called the Rain Coat

00:16.830 --> 00:18.710
that's gonna stop
the Storm Maker.

00:18.710 --> 00:21.120
Brady's gonna show up to steal
the plans for the Rain Coat.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.330
Obviously, he has no idea
it doesn't actually exist.

00:23.330 --> 00:24.830
Hand over those plans.

00:25.830 --> 00:28.960
Marisa? Thank you.
You saved my life.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.830
He took the bait just like
you said he would.

00:30.830 --> 00:33.540
There's only one person
that's close enough to Brady

00:33.540 --> 00:35.120
that can help us
take down the Alternate.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.330
The success of this entire
mission depends on Marisa.

00:41.460 --> 00:44.460
( indistinct chatter )

00:44.460 --> 00:45.750
Wow, what a big turnout.

00:45.750 --> 00:47.540
The Alternate
has the Storm Maker,

00:47.540 --> 00:49.830
so we had no choice
but to call a code red meeting.

00:49.830 --> 00:53.330
Okay, agents,
settle down.

00:55.460 --> 00:59.670
Although maybe we shoulda
called it a code black meeting.

00:59.670 --> 01:03.170
Who does he think
he's fooling with that dye job?

01:03.170 --> 01:06.540
Okay, we've all read
the Coopers' report.

01:06.540 --> 01:09.460
It's clear we are in
the middle of a hairy situation.

01:09.460 --> 01:11.040
Yeah, a dark hairy
situation.

01:12.500 --> 01:16.420
Fortunately, we're no longer
completely in the dark.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.540
We're close,
but not completely.

01:23.460 --> 01:26.330
We've been monitoring
the Alternate for over a year.

01:26.330 --> 01:28.670
They were a low priority
and small time

01:28.670 --> 01:30.540
until the last
couple of months,

01:30.540 --> 01:33.500
they found some rich lunatic
to fund their operation.

01:33.500 --> 01:35.580
We find that backer,
we can take 'em down.

01:35.580 --> 01:37.750
Looks like they're trying to fill
the void left by the Other Side.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.710
Do we know
who their leader is?

01:39.710 --> 01:41.170
No, but we do know,

01:41.170 --> 01:42.790
as long as they have
the Storm Maker,

01:42.790 --> 01:45.540
they're capable of bringing down
the entire world.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.620
It's up to us to stop them.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.620
So what you're saying is
we could all...

01:50.620 --> 01:53.540
die on this job.

01:53.540 --> 01:56.040
( agents snickering )

01:56.040 --> 01:57.540
KC, I know what you're doing.

01:57.540 --> 01:59.580
I tried to save
a couple of bucks,

01:59.580 --> 02:00.830
did the color myself.
It was a mistake.

02:00.830 --> 02:03.500
Let's just move on,
shall we?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.790
Yes, sir.

02:06.790 --> 02:08.380
Coopers, I want you
to take the lead on Brady.

02:08.380 --> 02:09.830
He's got information
we're gonna need.

02:09.830 --> 02:12.000
What about Marisa?

02:12.000 --> 02:13.960
Shouldn't we warn her that her boyfriend's
part of an evil splinter group?

02:13.960 --> 02:16.830
And he is still not the worst
boyfriend she's ever had.

02:19.250 --> 02:21.040
The less information
she knows, the better.

02:21.040 --> 02:23.420
Okay, people,
let's go.

02:23.420 --> 02:24.830
Excuse me,
Agent Johnson?

02:24.830 --> 02:27.540
Um, do you think I can
talk to you privately?

02:27.540 --> 02:29.830
- Look, if it's about--
- It's not about your hair.

02:32.290 --> 02:33.790
It's about Marisa.

02:33.790 --> 02:36.170
Um, although I would suggest
you wear a baseball cap

02:36.170 --> 02:38.250

03:34.670 --> 03:36.540
Oh, hey, Marisa.

03:36.540 --> 03:39.250
Just testing out some new
gadgets from the Organization.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.500
Hm. I see you're not wearing
that necklace Brady gave you.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.540
Trouble in paradise?

03:44.540 --> 03:46.830
Oh, no, no, no.
Trouble with the clasp.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.460
Me and Brady
are actually great.

03:48.460 --> 03:50.620
Oh, how sweet.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.750
Sweet, generous Brady.

03:52.750 --> 03:54.920
He's almost too good
to be true. Almost.

03:57.120 --> 03:59.080
Look, Marisa, there was
something really important

03:59.080 --> 04:00.540
I wanted to talk
to you about.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.080
The other night,
when you blasted into the alley

04:03.080 --> 04:05.750
and saved my life,
I realized something.

04:05.750 --> 04:08.580
I realized that
I have been a bad friend,

04:08.580 --> 04:11.790
and so, I decided to do what
you've been begging me to do.

04:11.790 --> 04:14.580
Yay. You made an appointment
to get a decent hairstyle.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.920
No.

04:18.420 --> 04:21.790
I, um, I told the Organization
how amazing you are,

04:21.790 --> 04:24.790
and Agent Johnson agreed,
and he will interview you

04:24.790 --> 04:27.540
for junior agent-in-training.

04:27.540 --> 04:29.670
- Wait, what?
- Yeah.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.710
KC, thank you.

04:31.710 --> 04:33.790
Thank you so much.

04:33.790 --> 04:36.330
You honestly have no idea
how much this means to me.

04:36.330 --> 04:39.420
Knowing that you believe in me,
and you got me this interview,

04:39.420 --> 04:42.420
it has me feeling so...

04:42.420 --> 04:44.540
So...

04:44.540 --> 04:45.960
Uh, sorry, sorry.

04:45.960 --> 04:48.500
The Organization
wants to interview me

04:48.500 --> 04:51.750
to be a junior
agent-in-training?

04:51.750 --> 04:54.790
Yeah, and your interview
is tomorrow.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.710
Unfortunately, you can't know
where the location

04:56.710 --> 04:58.580
of the Organization
actually is,

04:58.580 --> 05:00.960
so I'm gonna have to knock you out
and put a bag over your head,

05:00.960 --> 05:03.620
but, because
you're a friend,

05:03.620 --> 05:05.710
I got you a silk one instead
of the standard burlap.

05:05.710 --> 05:08.080
It's a lot more breathable
and a lot less scratchy.

05:09.790 --> 05:12.500
I'm just gonna have to get back to
you on this whole interview thing.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.120
Cool, cool.
Gotta go. Bye.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.830
Marisa, what...

05:15.830 --> 05:18.330
Was it the whole bag thing,
because once you get used to

05:18.330 --> 05:20.620
the smell of your own breath,
it's not that bad.

05:22.040 --> 05:23.710
Marisa!

05:36.290 --> 05:37.830
You know I can
see you, right?

05:39.830 --> 05:42.250
I literally have
eyes in the back of my head.

05:44.500 --> 05:48.170
Okay, FYI, that is creepy
beyond belief.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.790
What are you doing with

05:51.790 --> 05:55.000
the keys to Agent Craig's
classic 1969 muscle car?

05:55.000 --> 05:56.960
Which is ironic,
since that's the last year

05:56.960 --> 05:59.210
he actually had muscles.

05:59.210 --> 06:02.580
I'm just gonna move it
so I can put the trash cans out.

06:02.580 --> 06:04.120
Trash day
is Thursday.

06:04.120 --> 06:06.040
Try again, liar boy.

06:07.460 --> 06:10.580
Fine. I wanted to drive by
Monique's house

06:10.580 --> 06:12.750
so she could see me in a cool
car and think I'm awesome.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.670
And you're not gonna
tell Dad, got it?

06:14.670 --> 06:16.830
Fine. Knock yourself out.

06:21.710 --> 06:24.750
( tires screeching )

06:24.750 --> 06:26.750
( crash )

06:26.750 --> 06:28.830
ERNIE: Oh, no!

06:28.830 --> 06:32.000
Didn't need four eyes
to see that coming.

06:35.670 --> 06:38.920
Why would the Organization
want to interview me

06:38.920 --> 06:42.580
to be a junior agent
if I'm already a junior agent?

06:42.580 --> 06:45.040
Unless I'm not really
a junior agent,

06:45.040 --> 06:46.750
in which case,
just wondering,

06:46.750 --> 06:49.920
who the heck are you?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.380
I'm your handler.

06:51.380 --> 06:53.380
Really, 'cause
the only thing

06:53.380 --> 06:55.880
you seem to be handling
is a bunch of baloney.

06:55.880 --> 06:57.710
No, no, no, no.

06:57.710 --> 06:59.750
See, there's
a simple explanation.

06:59.750 --> 07:01.620
The Organization
didn't want KC to know

07:01.620 --> 07:03.580
that you're actually
spying--

07:03.580 --> 07:05.920
No, no, no, Brady,
Brady, just stop.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.540
You are a liar,
and I know you're a liar,

07:08.540 --> 07:12.830
because I'm a liar, and
it takes one to know one.

07:12.830 --> 07:14.420
Marisa, you have to trust me.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.710
Everything's gonna be okay.

07:16.710 --> 07:18.000
I love you, baby.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.790
I love you so much
that it hurts.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.880
- You're the best thing--
- Okay, you know what?

07:21.880 --> 07:24.380
Brady, stop.
You are lying again.

07:30.960 --> 07:33.250
Fine.
Here's the deal.

07:33.250 --> 07:35.120
I'm an agent with
the Alternate,

07:35.120 --> 07:37.580
a splinter group made up of
young, disillusioned agents

07:37.580 --> 07:39.170
from other organizations
who have joined together

07:39.170 --> 07:41.120
to take over the world.

07:41.120 --> 07:43.880
We want you to be a crucial
part of the revolution.

07:43.880 --> 07:47.830
Uh, no, thank you.

07:49.420 --> 07:51.920
Look, I learned all about
revolutions in school,

07:51.920 --> 07:53.750
and they all end
the same way.

07:53.750 --> 07:56.920
Everybody gets killed
by muskets or scurvy,

07:56.920 --> 07:58.960
and the pretty girl
with the blonde hair

07:58.960 --> 08:00.830
ends up on the wrong end
of the guillotine.

08:02.330 --> 08:05.420
So have fun at the
revolution without me.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.000
You're not going
anywhere.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.460
I mean, I get Marisa an interview
with the Organization,

08:21.460 --> 08:23.420
and she acts like I got her
extra math homework.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.080
It just doesn't add up.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.620
Neither does Marisa's
math homework.

08:28.620 --> 08:31.250
Mom, I'm serious.
I'm worried about her.

08:31.250 --> 08:34.620
This whole situation
is just weird.

08:34.620 --> 08:38.000
Okay, I know you think
her necklace is bugged,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.460
and honey, I hate to
bring this up,

08:40.460 --> 08:43.210
but is there any chance Marisa's actively
helping Brady and the Alternate?

08:43.210 --> 08:45.000
No, Mom, no.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.830
There's no way Marisa
would ever help them.

08:47.830 --> 08:51.500
No, there is no way
I would ever help you.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.080
I think you'll change
your mind after you hear this.

08:54.080 --> 08:56.000
MARISA: Once again,
KC's gone rogue.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.830
I hate to say it,
but I don't think

08:57.830 --> 08:59.960
she's worthy of being in
the Organization with us.

08:59.960 --> 09:03.080
BRADY: So you're ready to do
whatever it takes to bring her down?

09:03.080 --> 09:06.380
MARISA: I'm totally on board.
Whatever it takes.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.710
You know what? Fine.
Show that to KC.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.380
I will just tell her
you tricked me, apologize,

09:11.380 --> 09:12.500
and she will forgive me.

09:12.500 --> 09:14.880
That is what
best friends do.

09:14.880 --> 09:18.670
Maybe, but governments
aren't that forgiving.

09:18.670 --> 09:20.250
What is that
supposed to mean?

09:20.250 --> 09:21.920
It's called treason.

09:21.920 --> 09:23.790
You plotted against
your own country,

09:23.790 --> 09:26.120
and I've got
hours of audio to prove it.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.330
If I go to prison,
you go to prison forever.

09:29.330 --> 09:31.250
I can't go to prison.

09:31.250 --> 09:34.960
I have prom coming up
in a few months.

09:34.960 --> 09:37.670
You're not gonna say
a word to KC.

09:37.670 --> 09:40.500
But you are gonna take that
interview with the Organization,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.670
and figure out a way to get us the
plans for that Rain Coat device.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.580
What if they're holding
something over Marisa's head?

09:47.580 --> 09:49.460
Most traitors aren't born,
they're leveraged.

09:49.460 --> 09:51.040
Holding something
over Marisa's head?

09:51.040 --> 09:52.960
Let's be honest.

09:52.960 --> 09:54.330
Everything is over
Marisa's head.

09:56.330 --> 09:58.830
Besides, she's
no traitor, okay?

09:58.830 --> 10:00.710
Marisa would
never betray me.

10:00.710 --> 10:02.670
( cell phone rings )

10:02.670 --> 10:04.710
Hey, Marisa,
what's up?

10:04.710 --> 10:07.250
Hey, KC, um...
I just wanted to tell you

10:07.250 --> 10:10.080
I'm so sorry for acting
so weird earlier.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.290
I guess I was
overcome with emotion,

10:12.290 --> 10:14.580
and I had to pee, um...

10:17.120 --> 10:18.540
And I just wanna
let you know

10:18.540 --> 10:20.120
that I'm really,
really excited

10:20.120 --> 10:22.040
to meet with the Organization
tomorrow.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.960
Great. I will
talk to you later.

10:24.960 --> 10:27.080
Actually, I'm gonna
sneak into your house,

10:27.080 --> 10:29.620
and put a bag
over your head,

10:29.620 --> 10:31.290
and put you in
the trunk later, but...

10:31.290 --> 10:33.830
either way,
excited to see you.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.830
That was Marisa.

10:35.830 --> 10:37.330
Apparently,
everything's all good.

10:37.330 --> 10:38.880
I guess I was just
worried for nothing.

10:46.290 --> 10:48.750
You've gotta
help me, Judy.

10:48.750 --> 10:49.920
Why should I?

10:49.920 --> 10:51.750
Because you're my sister.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.750
That's what brothers
and sisters do for each other.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.330
I prefer to think of
our relationship

10:56.330 --> 10:59.120
as sophisticated humanoid
and her annoying housemate.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.000
Besides, I'm looking forward
to seeing that vein

11:04.000 --> 11:08.920
in Agent Craig's forehead pop out
right before he screams at you.

11:08.920 --> 11:10.790
Fine.

11:10.790 --> 11:13.380
I guess we don't have
that close sibling relationship

11:13.380 --> 11:14.710
I thought we did.

11:14.710 --> 11:17.540
I guess when
the chips are down,

11:17.540 --> 11:19.620
I can't count on you.

11:19.620 --> 11:22.170
I guess you're
just a robot,

11:22.170 --> 11:24.000
and not a sister.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.500
( sighs )

11:29.500 --> 11:31.120
Fine, I'll help you.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.920
Step aside,
manipulative one.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.210
That's the wrong color!

11:47.210 --> 11:50.380
You didn't specify
what color you wanted.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.790
I made an artistic choice.

11:52.790 --> 11:54.380
Deal with it.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.710
All right, so... ready to
prep for your interview?

12:00.710 --> 12:03.170
This isn't gonna be
anything like studying, is it?

12:03.170 --> 12:05.380
No, no, no.
You're actually gonna do this.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.210
Huh. I see you're wearing that
necklace Brady gave you again.

12:11.210 --> 12:14.000
( hiccups )
Oh, I have the hiccups.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.170
Or maybe it was
just one hiccup.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.670
Nope, definitely the hiccups.

12:19.500 --> 12:21.420
The necklace, yeah,
Brady fixed it for me.

12:21.420 --> 12:22.880
He is so sweet.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.460
Did I tell you
he got me flowers?

12:24.460 --> 12:26.080
( hiccups )
He treats me so well.

12:26.080 --> 12:29.080
Maybe some water would
help with these hiccups.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.960
Yeah, sure.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.880
- Ah!
- ( shrieks )

12:45.880 --> 12:47.380
Did I scare the hiccups
outta you?

12:47.380 --> 12:50.170
You scared something
outta me.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.250
Marisa, are you
searching my computer

12:55.250 --> 12:58.120
for Project Rain Coat?

12:58.120 --> 12:59.710
No. No, no.

12:59.710 --> 13:01.460
I was shopping.

13:01.460 --> 13:03.750
I was shopping for
a rain coat,

13:03.750 --> 13:05.290
because, you know,
the weather report

13:05.290 --> 13:06.960
said that rain coats
were on sale,

13:06.960 --> 13:08.710
and, um...

13:08.710 --> 13:10.920
Uh...

13:10.920 --> 13:13.250
I can't do this anymore.
I can't keep lying to you.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.710
Brady forced me
to do this.

13:16.710 --> 13:18.080
Okay, Marisa,
not another word.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.120
No, no, I have
to tell you.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.210
- I have to get this off my chest.
- Sh!

13:22.210 --> 13:23.460
Not another word.

13:23.460 --> 13:26.290
- What are you doing?
- Sh.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.380
Brady put a listening device
in here,

13:34.380 --> 13:37.540
and that's how he's been
tracking my every move.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.670
There's no microphone
in here.

13:39.670 --> 13:40.960
Why is there
no microphone in here?

13:40.960 --> 13:44.040
Because I'm
the microphone.

13:46.620 --> 13:48.540
What are you
talking about?

13:48.540 --> 13:50.330
Brady tricked me.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.500
Look, I am so sorry, KC.

13:52.500 --> 13:54.710
I have been telling
him everything.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.460
I have been spying on you,
but I didn't meant to.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.330
I promise it wasn't
my fault.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.500
He told me that I was
working for the Organization,

14:00.500 --> 14:02.500
but I'm not working for
the Organization.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.290
I'm working with
some sort of splinter group,

14:04.290 --> 14:06.830
and I don't even know
what a splinter group is,

14:06.830 --> 14:08.620
but I know I don't
wanna be in one.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.330
Marisa...

14:12.330 --> 14:14.120
I need you to slow down,

14:14.120 --> 14:16.210
because if there's
anything that you're saying

14:16.210 --> 14:18.380
that will stop me from
throwing you out that window,

14:18.380 --> 14:20.290
I really wanna hear it.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.040
KC, I am so sorry.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.790
I have never been
more sorry in my entire life.

14:28.790 --> 14:31.170
You're my best friend
in the whole world,

14:31.170 --> 14:32.620
and I never meant
to betray you,

14:32.620 --> 14:34.830
so I hope you can
forgive me,

14:34.830 --> 14:36.830
because I am in
over my head.

14:36.830 --> 14:38.380
I'm in the deep end
of the pool,

14:38.380 --> 14:40.380
and I don't have
any floaties.

14:40.380 --> 14:42.830
KC, please be
my floaties.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.540
All right, I got rid of
all the green paint.

14:55.540 --> 14:57.540
What do you think?

14:57.540 --> 14:59.830
I think you got rid
of all of the paint.

15:01.830 --> 15:03.420
It's a big gray mess.

15:03.420 --> 15:06.380
We need to have this
professionally repainted.

15:06.380 --> 15:08.330
Okay, here's a place.

15:08.330 --> 15:10.080
Speedy Paint.

15:10.080 --> 15:11.790
They can fix that door
in an hour or less.

15:15.210 --> 15:17.120
Okay, so where
do we bring it?

15:19.670 --> 15:23.250
They come to us.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.960
Well, I wish you'd
mentioned that sooner.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.580
So do I.

15:31.170 --> 15:33.290
I know she's been
your best friend forever,

15:33.290 --> 15:34.830
but I don't think
we can trust her.

15:34.830 --> 15:37.580
Look, I'm not happy
with what she did, either,

15:37.580 --> 15:41.250
but she is my best friend, okay,
and I know that I can trust her.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.250
Plus, she took three
lie detector tests and passed.

15:44.250 --> 15:47.670
Honestly, she's never passed
three tests in her life, so...

15:49.250 --> 15:53.420
( both muttering )

15:53.420 --> 15:55.380
I really wanna
make this right.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.080
Good. You can start by
making nice with Brady.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.790
- What do you mean?
- You are gonna spy on him.

15:59.790 --> 16:03.040
You're the only one who can get close
enough to him, and we need answers.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.460
We've received reports of three
snowstorms happening at the equator,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.460
and monsoons in
the Sahara.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.460
That means
we're running out of time.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.540
The Storm Maker's
already been activated.

16:11.540 --> 16:13.500
We need to find it
and disable it

16:13.500 --> 16:15.500
- before it starts taking out cities.
- What do I need to do?

16:15.500 --> 16:17.170
Brady thinks you're
a double agent.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.120
You're gonna be
a triple agent.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.290
What does that even mean?

16:20.290 --> 16:22.120
You're gonna spy on him,

16:22.120 --> 16:24.380
spying on us while
he spies on...

16:24.380 --> 16:26.420
No, wait.

16:28.120 --> 16:30.290
You're gonna spy on us
spying on him,

16:30.290 --> 16:32.120
while spying on... no.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.710
You're gonna spy on
us and him while he...

16:35.710 --> 16:37.420
You know what,
just get him talking.

16:39.250 --> 16:42.040
We need to figure out
who Brady is working with

16:42.040 --> 16:43.330
so we can bring down
the Alternate.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.290
And this is dangerous,
so if you can't handle it,

16:45.290 --> 16:48.170
you need to let us know, and
we'll come up with another plan.

16:48.170 --> 16:50.540
No. Like I told
my guidance counselor

16:50.540 --> 16:52.750
last year and the year
before that,

16:52.750 --> 16:56.290
I am not dropping out.

16:56.290 --> 16:58.830
Go, me!

17:06.120 --> 17:07.580
CRAIG: Ernie! Judy!

17:13.580 --> 17:16.750
Oh... my... gosh!

17:18.250 --> 17:21.000
What happened
to your car?

17:21.000 --> 17:24.420
It seems as if
it's been vandalized.

17:26.420 --> 17:28.540
It looks like
the Alternate did it.

17:28.540 --> 17:31.210
That car-ruining Alternate.

17:31.210 --> 17:35.540
Does their evil
know no bounds?

17:35.540 --> 17:38.540
Kids, we need to pack our stuff
and get outta here.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.460
The Alternate
knows where we live.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.500
We need new passports,
new identities.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.460
I think we gotta tell him.

17:45.460 --> 17:47.540
You're right.

17:47.540 --> 17:48.620
( sighs )

17:48.620 --> 17:50.540
Dad...

17:50.540 --> 17:52.330
there's something
you should know.

17:53.580 --> 17:55.500
Judy messed up your car.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.620
It's all her fault.

17:57.620 --> 18:00.750
What?!
My fault?

18:00.750 --> 18:04.460
He's the one who wanted to take it
for a joyride to impress some girl.

18:04.460 --> 18:08.460
Darn fool never even made it
to the end of the driveway.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.460
Knock it off, you two.

18:10.460 --> 18:12.380
I already know
the Alternate didn't do it.

18:12.380 --> 18:14.040
But you're still gonna
need new identities.

18:14.040 --> 18:16.380
- Why?
- You gonna disappear.

18:16.380 --> 18:18.040
I'm gonna make you
disappear!

18:22.290 --> 18:25.500
The Storm Maker test
was a massive success.

18:25.500 --> 18:27.500
The whole world
is freaking out.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.830
You should feel good.

18:28.830 --> 18:32.620
We got those Storm Maker plans
because of your intelligence.

18:32.620 --> 18:36.330
Wow. There's an expression
I never thought I'd use.

18:38.420 --> 18:41.670
Hey, he brought up the
Alternate and the Storm Maker.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.880
That opens up the door
for her to talk about it, too.

18:43.880 --> 18:47.380
So, Brady,
I have a question.

18:47.380 --> 18:48.790
Okay, here we go.

18:48.790 --> 18:50.830
I'm so proud
of you, Marisa.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.500
What do you think
I should order?

18:55.380 --> 18:57.620
They've got chicken parm on the menu today.
That looks good.

18:57.620 --> 19:01.080
And they wanna
recruit this girl?

19:01.080 --> 19:03.500
Look, guys, this is
a lot of pressure.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.540
I'm sure she's
just nervous.

19:05.540 --> 19:06.960
Come on, Marisa, you got this.
Let's go.

19:06.960 --> 19:10.500
Chicken parm it is.

19:10.500 --> 19:12.460
Oh, hey,
that reminds me.

19:12.460 --> 19:14.380
Who else is in
the Alternate?

19:15.880 --> 19:18.080
What?

19:18.080 --> 19:19.750
Well, you know,

19:19.750 --> 19:21.670
when you mentioned
chicken parm,

19:21.670 --> 19:24.250
it reminded me how
I never met anyone else

19:24.250 --> 19:26.460
from the Alternate
except you.

19:28.620 --> 19:30.170
This was a mistake.

19:30.170 --> 19:31.500
BOTH: You think?

19:33.500 --> 19:34.670
So...

19:34.670 --> 19:36.750
this Storm Maker machine
you mentioned,

19:36.750 --> 19:39.250
I would love to see it
up close.

19:39.250 --> 19:41.460
Hey, I think
we're back on track.

19:41.460 --> 19:43.580
Maybe you could tell me
where it is,

19:43.580 --> 19:45.580
and I could go
check it out myself,

19:45.580 --> 19:48.170
all alone,
not with anyone else.

19:49.620 --> 19:52.080
Guys, she is completely
blowing it,

19:52.080 --> 19:54.460
but the good news is,
I have a back-up plan.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.290
- Which is?
- You'll see.

19:59.460 --> 20:01.500
Marisa, I don't know
what you think you're doing,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.330
but it's not gonna work.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.830
If you don't wanna spend
the rest of your life in prison,

20:05.830 --> 20:07.830
you're gonna find out
where the Rain Coat is.

20:07.830 --> 20:09.290
Am I being clear?

20:09.290 --> 20:11.670
Yes.

20:11.670 --> 20:15.290
Get outta here.
I'm done with you.

20:15.290 --> 20:16.460
Fine.

20:20.080 --> 20:24.540
Worse mission fail ever.

20:24.540 --> 20:27.460
Yep. That couldn't have
gone any worse.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.580
Oh, you spoke
too soon, Craig.

20:29.580 --> 20:31.580
She just
walked back in.

20:34.460 --> 20:37.880
I'm sorry, but you were
just very rude to me,

20:37.880 --> 20:39.540
and I don't care for it
one bit.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.580
In fact, I'm done
spying for you.

20:41.580 --> 20:43.670
That's right.
I quit.

20:43.670 --> 20:45.830
No, that is not
the right thing to say.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.670
Craig, I think she's gonna
get herself hurt.

20:48.670 --> 20:52.500
And FYI, Brady,
or whatever your real name is,

20:52.500 --> 20:55.710
I actually know
all about the Rain Coat,

20:55.710 --> 20:57.620
and I'm gonna help
KC use it

20:57.620 --> 21:00.460
to destroy
the Storm Maker.

21:00.460 --> 21:02.580
Oh, really?

21:05.540 --> 21:06.920
Let's go.

21:14.710 --> 21:16.710
Come on, Kira, we gotta
get her outta there.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.790
Hey, Coopers.
Where you going?

21:20.790 --> 21:22.250
Can't talk now, Marisa.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.620
Brady's about to
take you prisoner,

21:23.620 --> 21:25.580
but don't worry,
we won't let him.

21:25.580 --> 21:28.290
Stay here until we can
bring you back safely.

21:28.290 --> 21:30.210
Wait a minute.

21:30.210 --> 21:33.170
Why are you here
if you're there?

21:33.170 --> 21:36.330
Because I'm following
KC's back-up plan.

21:36.330 --> 21:38.790
If it was clear I wasn't
gonna be able to get the intel

21:38.790 --> 21:40.420
you guys needed from Brady,

21:40.420 --> 21:41.920
I was supposed to leave,
switch places with her,

21:41.920 --> 21:43.790
and she would go back in
disguised as me.

21:43.790 --> 21:45.710
But now KC's
their prisoner.

21:45.710 --> 21:48.000
Which was her plan
all along.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.120
That's my girl.

21:54.380 --> 21:55.620
What are you doing?

21:55.620 --> 21:56.830
Why is she here?

21:56.830 --> 21:58.250
We have to take
her with us.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.830
How many times
do I have to tell you

21:59.830 --> 22:01.540
to stop falling in love
with your targets?

22:01.540 --> 22:03.620
Kris and I had
something special, okay?

22:03.620 --> 22:05.830
Besides, this is different.

22:05.830 --> 22:08.790
Marisa threatened to
expose us to the Organization,

22:08.790 --> 22:11.000
and she has information
about Project Rain Coat.

22:11.000 --> 22:14.790
Fine. But if I catch you
making googly eyes at her,

22:14.790 --> 22:18.000
she's going over a roof,
just like Kris did.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.750
You told me
Kris moved.

22:19.750 --> 22:22.250
Yes, very quickly
to the ground.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.420
Well, is Kris okay?

22:25.420 --> 22:27.790
Yeah. Sure.
Why not?

22:29.620 --> 22:31.880
Anyway, we'll take
Marisa with us.

22:31.880 --> 22:33.620
But once she's locked up,

22:33.620 --> 22:36.620
it'll be time to start
the storm of the century.

22:36.620 --> 22:38.790
By the end of the day,
the world will see

22:38.790 --> 22:41.210
just how powerful
the Alternate is.

22:41.210 --> 22:43.420
BOTH: The Alternate
will reign supreme.

22:43.420 --> 22:46.040
The Alternate
will reign supreme.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.170
The Alternate will
reign supreme.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.710
Rob, your name's on TV.
