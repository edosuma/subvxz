00:05.875 --> 00:08.250
- I understand you three wanna
report a missing person?

00:08.333 --> 00:10.125
both: Yes.
- Yes, that is right.

00:10.208 --> 00:11.208
- We are here to do that.

00:11.291 --> 00:12.875
- In an ironic twist of fate,

00:12.958 --> 00:15.375
our friend Dory Sief
has gone missing.

00:15.458 --> 00:18.541
- Your Honor, there's a twink
that we believed to be dead

00:18.625 --> 00:20.583
who may have kidnapped
Dory Sief.

00:20.666 --> 00:22.250
Now, we're currently working
on retrieving

00:22.333 --> 00:24.916
his contact information
from, um...

00:25.000 --> 00:26.458
a ca--a catering company.
- Yeah.

00:26.541 --> 00:28.625
- Let me stop you right there.

00:28.708 --> 00:31.166
Dory Sief is not missing.

00:31.250 --> 00:32.333
- What?
- No.

00:32.416 --> 00:34.000
- She just wants
to be left alone.

00:34.083 --> 00:35.541
- Well--well, where is she?

00:35.625 --> 00:38.375
- That is none of my business,
nor is it yours, either.

00:38.458 --> 00:41.250
- Um, what the heck
are you talking about?

00:41.333 --> 00:43.166
- Dory Sief is in hiding,

00:43.250 --> 00:45.916
and it is our duty
to protect her privacy.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.416
She let us know
she didn't wanna be found

00:47.500 --> 00:49.541
and that you three might come
looking for her.

00:49.625 --> 00:52.208
I can't stop you
from contacting her further,

00:52.291 --> 00:54.083
but I might just consider this

00:54.166 --> 00:57.625
an unofficial...
restraining order.

00:57.708 --> 00:58.625
[both laugh]

00:58.708 --> 00:59.708
- What?
- That's insane.

00:59.791 --> 01:00.791
- Yeah, no.

01:00.875 --> 01:02.291
- I'm sorry, what?
What?

01:02.375 --> 01:03.458
- She doesn't like you,

01:03.541 --> 01:04.916
and she wants to be left alone.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.416
It's very normal
for people like her

01:06.500 --> 01:09.041
who have become unfavorable
in the public eye

01:09.125 --> 01:10.750
to drop out of society

01:10.833 --> 01:12.916
to try to build a new life
for themselves,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.750
find some peace.

01:14.833 --> 01:16.500
Can't you just respect that?

01:16.583 --> 01:17.458
[knock at door]

01:17.541 --> 01:18.750
- God.
- Wait...

01:18.833 --> 01:21.666
- Oh, sorry to interrupt.
Frank needs you.

01:21.750 --> 01:24.291
- Okay, I'm just very confused
right now, as her friend.

01:24.375 --> 01:25.375
Like, did Dory come

01:25.458 --> 01:26.708
and tell you
all this personally?

01:26.791 --> 01:28.000
- No.

01:28.083 --> 01:29.583
She sent us
a beautifully written letter

01:29.666 --> 01:30.833
stating her intentions

01:30.916 --> 01:32.125
that also said she appreciates

01:32.208 --> 01:34.000
the fine and handsome men
in blue.

01:34.083 --> 01:35.750
- Are you talking
about Dory Sief?

01:35.833 --> 01:37.000
- Yeah?

01:37.083 --> 01:39.791
- That was such a nice letter.

01:39.875 --> 01:41.958
You could tell she put thought
into it.

01:42.041 --> 01:44.791
Oh, and she also included
this watercolor painting

01:44.875 --> 01:46.125
of the police seal.

01:46.208 --> 01:47.041
- Oh, God.

01:47.125 --> 01:49.458
- So nice, and talented.

01:49.541 --> 01:51.000
- If you wanna go down
this road,

01:51.083 --> 01:53.166
you can fill out
all the paperwork you want,

01:53.250 --> 01:54.791
but just know this:

01:54.875 --> 01:56.625
Dory Sief is safe,

01:56.708 --> 01:58.791
and she just doesn't need to be
put through any more hell.

01:58.875 --> 01:59.875
- [scoffs]
- We love her here.

01:59.958 --> 02:01.166
- And just like that,

02:01.250 --> 02:02.708
I'm talking
to Twinkies Catering.

02:02.791 --> 02:04.333
They've got the address
of the Twink, yeah.

02:04.416 --> 02:06.083
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. So it was that easy.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.250
It was actually that easy.
You were of no help, sir.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.875
- Thank you for nothing.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.958
- I'm so sorry about that,
and thank you for your time.

like, a criminal record

05:35.583 --> 05:38.208

said to me was,

his name's Zacky Twiggs,
he's 30 years old,

05:41.166 --> 05:42.375

that too.

late that day,

08:13.458 --> 08:14.916
and they said I was
already at work,

08:15.000 --> 08:16.666

and then they showed me
