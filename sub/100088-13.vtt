00:45.646 --> 00:47.960
Any word on if they rescued
Dr. Craig or his colleagues?

00:48.028 --> 00:49.494

No word on mission

00:53.090 --> 00:54.332

02:09.775 --> 02:11.474

02:11.543 --> 02:13.108
But judging by the way you all look,

02:13.177 --> 02:15.578
I'm not sure I can say
the same about Bravo.

02:16.067 --> 02:17.479
What the hell happened?

02:17.664 --> 02:20.783
Dr. Craig stuck his neck out
for us and we failed him.

Gonna put the team under a microscope,
that's for sure,

02:23.187 --> 02:26.055

the team will be fine.

02:26.123 --> 02:27.924

- The optics are bad.
- I don't care about optics right now.

02:48.312 --> 02:49.579
I'm concerned about reality.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.146
Reality is that the teams

02:51.215 --> 02:53.348
have had a string of bad press lately

02:53.417 --> 02:55.617
and we can't afford another black eye.

02:55.686 --> 02:59.621
Look, we pulled ISR off target,
so I am out of the loop.

02:59.690 --> 03:01.949
Tell me this was a clean op.

03:02.393 --> 03:03.959
I can't tell you that.

to go join my team,

03:12.869 --> 03:14.936
there was an explosion.
That's what killed Craig.

03:15.005 --> 03:16.705
Did you identify the
source of the explosion?

03:16.773 --> 03:18.507
My priority was getting my
team back to this plane alive.

03:18.576 --> 03:19.941
I didn't have time to ask questions.

Well, I suggest that you make time now,

so I threw the crash,

Why the hell can't we just do
this when we get back stateside?

07:12.222 --> 07:13.933
Why? 'Cause we got a British doctor,
you know, who worked

07:13.994 --> 07:18.330
for the CIA who was killed in a
failed Tier One op. That's why.

07:18.373 --> 07:19.825

out exactly what happened

07:19.908 --> 07:22.217

have Command all over us.

08:56.907 --> 08:58.406

08:58.475 --> 09:00.008
I definitely called it.

09:00.077 --> 09:02.410
Yeah, he did.
Saved our asses dropping that guy.

09:02.479 --> 09:04.079
All right, well,
comms were spotty all day.

09:04.147 --> 09:06.114
So we push up on Dr. Craig,

09:06.182 --> 09:08.950
not knowing that there's tangos
on target wearing VIP passes

09:09.019 --> 09:10.851
to the 72 Club.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.552

09:12.622 --> 09:14.354
can't we expect that others did, too?

09:14.423 --> 09:16.556
- Room didn't blow itself up.
- CLAY: Yeah,

09:16.626 --> 09:18.225
it tracks for me that a tango
in the room was strapped.

09:18.293 --> 09:19.693
All right, so we know that
the enemy was in trouble.

09:19.762 --> 09:21.895
He panics and clacks off his vest.

09:21.964 --> 09:24.933

Ray, you good with that?

As much as I'd like to tie
a bow on around all of this,

09:28.037 --> 09:29.870
we were dodging lead;
I never saw a vest.

09:29.939 --> 09:30.938

09:31.007 --> 09:32.405
doesn't mean that it didn't happen.

09:34.110 --> 09:35.709
what'd you see?

09:35.778 --> 09:40.080
Well, with this new
intel on the-on the vest,

09:40.149 --> 09:42.549
I've changed my perspective.

09:42.618 --> 09:45.084
That tango was wearing
a pretty baggy jacket.

09:46.093 --> 09:47.768
VIC: Pretty hot to be bundled up.

09:47.846 --> 09:50.089
Could be concealing explosives.

record that you saw a vest?

09:53.629 --> 09:55.762

You know, being on the other side,
and hearing your friends

11:22.550 --> 11:25.417
are in the line of fire, well...

11:25.486 --> 11:27.818
you really changed my perspective

11:27.887 --> 11:29.901
of what you must go through.

11:30.158 --> 11:32.156
Well, Sonny,

11:32.225 --> 11:34.158
I'm glad it took me
almost getting killed

11:34.227 --> 11:36.427
- to reveal your sympathy gene.
- (LAUGHING)

11:36.496 --> 11:37.928
(DAVIS CHUCKLES)

11:37.997 --> 11:39.864
Oh, you know.

11:39.932 --> 11:41.733
You gonna document
that bell getting rung?

11:41.801 --> 11:43.501
Come on, Sonny. It's nothing.

11:45.338 --> 11:48.105
I've never seen you
report a head injury.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.207
That's 'cause the
contents inside my head

11:50.277 --> 11:53.043
are far less valuable than
the contents in your head.

11:53.112 --> 11:55.680
- Okay.
- Okay? Just-just put it in your jacket.

11:55.749 --> 11:58.416
Look, you don't want to be
kicking yourself years from now

11:58.485 --> 12:00.685
because you didn't take my
advice about your health.

12:00.754 --> 12:03.120
Well, listening to you is
usually bad for my health.

12:03.189 --> 12:04.621
Oh, okay. Okay.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.423
- (CHUCKLES)
- Hey.

12:07.707 --> 12:10.527
You got eyes on that S-vest
in that room with Dr. Craig?

12:12.288 --> 12:13.898
I told you what I saw.

12:13.966 --> 12:15.732
What, my answer ain't
good enough for you?

12:15.802 --> 12:18.102
Just... seems off.

12:18.171 --> 12:21.138
Okay. Bravo found the answer.

12:21.796 --> 12:24.108
Not your concern. Turn the page.

12:24.177 --> 12:26.610
I'm just trying to clear up some
things that aren't tracking.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.264
RAY: What's not tracking?

12:30.316 --> 12:32.749
What's spinning in that
head of yours, Davis?

12:32.819 --> 12:34.819
Oh, nothing. Just... we're good.

12:34.887 --> 12:36.812
- Hmm.
- RAY: Hey, we're not doing the team any favors

12:38.190 --> 12:40.723
if we're making a bad call here.
What's-what's up?

12:40.792 --> 12:43.059
Listen,
can we all please just stop playing

12:43.128 --> 12:44.961
Monday morning quarterback,
have a couple beers,

12:45.030 --> 12:46.630
and enjoy this long-ass flight home?

12:46.631 --> 12:48.625
- An innocent man is dead, Sonny.
- Hmm.

12:48.533 --> 12:50.615
All right? Let's put all
our cards on the table.

12:50.616 --> 12:51.701
What's bothering you?

12:52.613 --> 12:54.270
It's not Hezbollah's MO

12:54.339 --> 12:56.239
to kill hostages that
have value to them.

12:56.308 --> 12:57.974
And it's very rare for them

12:58.043 --> 13:00.977
to use suicide bombs
as defensive measures.

13:01.752 --> 13:05.081
If there was an S-vest in
the room with Dr. Craig,

13:05.150 --> 13:07.450
then why wasn't there one with Dr. Kay?

13:07.518 --> 13:09.085
Look, we ain't fighting
Hezbollah cyborgs

13:09.154 --> 13:10.486
that all fight the same.

13:10.555 --> 13:13.489
You're turning it into
s-some sort of math equation.

13:13.558 --> 13:16.592
One plus one does not add up
to jack in combat, guys.

13:16.661 --> 13:18.861
Well, Sonny's right.
Look, we're overthinking this.

13:18.929 --> 13:20.363
I'm sorry that I said anything, Ray.

13:20.431 --> 13:21.864
Mm.

13:24.168 --> 13:25.334
That entry was hell,

13:25.403 --> 13:27.936
and somehow you saw an S-vest?

13:28.005 --> 13:29.839
Command wants an answer.

13:29.907 --> 13:31.474
I'm gonna give them one.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.308
But we're looking for the truth, Sonny.

13:33.378 --> 13:35.310
If you saw a vest, why the hell
didn't you yell "avalanche"?

13:35.380 --> 13:37.312
It was all moving pretty fast.

13:37.382 --> 13:38.947
And without knowing Clay's half of it,

13:39.016 --> 13:41.116
didn't make a whole lot
of sense in the moment.

13:41.185 --> 13:43.185
I love you to death, brother, and I know

13:43.254 --> 13:44.853
you'll do anything to keep
our asses out of the fire.

13:44.982 --> 13:46.219
Yeah, that's what
the brotherhood's about.

13:46.270 --> 13:47.430
Yeah, but the brotherhood's

13:47.507 --> 13:49.594
also about being
truthful with each other.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.459
Do yourself a favor, Ray.

13:51.528 --> 13:52.494
Stop being a martyr.

13:52.562 --> 13:54.829
Put your ass to bed.

13:54.898 --> 13:57.098
Did you see a vest or not, Sonny?

13:58.802 --> 14:01.436
(MAN SCREAMING, GRUNTING)

14:09.646 --> 14:10.912
On me.

14:10.980 --> 14:12.447
(GUNFIRE)

14:16.449 --> 14:19.153
Nothing you say or do
can bring Dr. Craig back.

14:19.222 --> 14:20.988
Did you see a vest?

14:21.057 --> 14:23.157
No, both tangos were in T-shirts,

14:23.226 --> 14:24.825
and neither were rigged to blow.

14:24.894 --> 14:26.327
Damn it, Sonny! You know you can get

14:26.396 --> 14:27.861
your ass in a fire for lying like this.

14:27.931 --> 14:29.897
Yeah, I just wanted to
close the hatch and move on.

14:29.966 --> 14:31.899
The number-one rule in a kill house,

14:31.968 --> 14:33.067
number-one rule in a hostage rescue is

14:33.136 --> 14:35.102
the hostage cannot die.

14:35.171 --> 14:37.071
Bravo needs to know what went wrong.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.740
Dead hostages is as serious
as the business end of a .45.

14:39.809 --> 14:41.775
Career ender if somebody
wants to make a mess of it.

14:41.844 --> 14:44.078
And no good will come
of it we dig any deeper.

14:44.147 --> 14:45.781
So move on.

14:48.451 --> 14:51.485
I'm waking everyone up.
We need to get to the truth.

14:54.757 --> 14:55.756
Wake up.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.855
What do you mean there was
no S-vest, all right?

15:01.010 --> 15:03.484
Clay put a guy down right
before he clacked one off.

15:03.551 --> 15:05.884
Yep. Dude, I'm telling you,
this guy was 100%

15:05.953 --> 15:07.452
wearing an S-vest, there's no doubt.

15:07.521 --> 15:09.921
And then Sonny confirmed
seeing one in Dr. Craig's room.

15:09.989 --> 15:11.155
That's not how it went down.

15:11.224 --> 15:13.112
How'd it go down?

15:13.421 --> 15:14.326
Tell him, Sonny.

15:14.394 --> 15:16.093
(GROANS)

15:16.436 --> 15:18.663
- I might have misremembered.
- JASON: Misremembered?

15:18.732 --> 15:20.131
What, are you trying to get
us and the team jammed up?

15:20.200 --> 15:21.566
Look, the only truth is,

15:21.635 --> 15:24.302
is that Dr. Craig is dead.
Okay? Don't matter

15:24.371 --> 15:27.271
if it's an AK, PKM or a vest.
He died in combat.

15:27.341 --> 15:29.273
That doesn't work for the brass, Sonny.

15:29.343 --> 15:31.409
CLAY: If the brass can't accept
the way the war's fought,

15:31.478 --> 15:33.077
maybe they should stop
sending us in there to fight.

15:33.146 --> 15:34.512
We gotta keep at it. Okay?

15:34.581 --> 15:37.403
Not for the cake eaters,
but for Dr. Craig.

15:39.053 --> 15:40.585
JASON: Gotta work from the outside in.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.519
I was external,

15:43.407 --> 15:45.356
working C2.

15:45.424 --> 15:47.458
Bravo 2, this is 1. Radio check.

15:47.526 --> 15:48.960
Bravo 2, this is 1. Radio check.

(EXPLOSION)

15:50.163 --> 15:51.929
(EXPLOSION)

15:56.936 --> 15:58.502
Wait a minute, you heard two explosions?

15:58.571 --> 16:00.537
One on the heels of the other.
Very distinct.

16:00.606 --> 16:02.806
Could have been a
sympathetic detonation.

16:02.876 --> 16:04.541
Crashes cause fires all the time.

16:04.610 --> 16:06.177
I mean, if there was any
accelerant in that room,

16:06.246 --> 16:07.178
a crash could have set it off.

16:07.247 --> 16:09.213
Okay, well, it's possible.

16:09.282 --> 16:12.383
Anybody see any explosives, ammo crates?

16:12.451 --> 16:15.386
Yeah, I-I might have seen some.

16:15.454 --> 16:17.988
We were on the south side
of the target building

16:18.056 --> 16:19.189
going down the hallway.

16:19.258 --> 16:20.257
RAY: <i>Sonny, on me.</i>

16:27.400 --> 16:29.400
(TWO GUNSHOTS)

16:31.203 --> 16:33.837
(MAN CRYING OUT)

16:33.906 --> 16:35.906
(PAINED SCREAMING)

16:39.949 --> 16:42.479
You're saying that you saw
fuel being stored in the room?

16:42.548 --> 16:44.848
- The same room as the hostages?
- Two cannisters.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.850
JASON: What, am I supposed
to believe you this time?

16:46.919 --> 16:49.352
SONNY: I swear on my Grandninny's grave.

16:49.421 --> 16:50.486
No, no, he-he's telling the truth,

16:50.555 --> 16:52.322
because I saw the generator
in the other room.

16:52.391 --> 16:54.257
The genny probably runs on diesel.

16:54.326 --> 16:56.692
JASON: You know what,
I felt the explosion outside.

16:56.761 --> 16:59.062
It was, uh, it was huge.
It definitely had a...

16:59.131 --> 17:01.697
serious concussive force.

17:01.766 --> 17:04.000
That-that fuel would
have to be sitting there

17:04.069 --> 17:06.002
just exposed, emitting vapors

17:06.070 --> 17:07.304
for it to light off from that crash.

17:07.372 --> 17:08.438
Well, I don't think that
these guys are concerned

17:08.506 --> 17:10.373
with following procedures.

17:10.442 --> 17:13.410
- It's improbable, but not impossible.
- Sonny,

17:13.478 --> 17:15.711
what side of the room were the drums on?

17:15.780 --> 17:17.247
Right side.

17:19.691 --> 17:22.185
RAY: I threw the crash all the way
into the left side of the room.

17:22.253 --> 17:24.219
There's no way it was
the fuel that exploded.

17:24.288 --> 17:26.589
CLAY: Okay, so what, the room
just spontaneously combusted?

17:26.657 --> 17:28.591
SONNY: Entire room blew up
into a bunch of toothpicks.

17:28.660 --> 17:30.793
There's no way that Ray's
flash-crash did that.

17:30.862 --> 17:33.128
JASON: All right, look, you know what,
we're looking too hard at ourselves.

17:33.197 --> 17:34.897
What if... Did we miss
anything in the clearance?

17:34.966 --> 17:37.132
CLAY: The enemy has a say in the fight.

17:37.201 --> 17:38.400
We didn't encounter any unknowns,

17:38.470 --> 17:39.702
and anybody we saw with a weapon

17:39.771 --> 17:41.403
we put down on our way to the hostages.

17:41.473 --> 17:44.574
All right, Clay, what happened
after the S-vest blew?

17:44.642 --> 17:47.142
Look, man, I can't see
how we missed anyone.

17:47.211 --> 17:48.611
The target was pretty straightforward

17:48.680 --> 17:50.212
after the S-vest blew.

17:50.281 --> 17:52.882
We ended up with a hot hallway.

17:52.951 --> 17:54.450
All stations, this is Bravo 6.
We have S-vests on target.

17:54.519 --> 17:55.585
I say again...

17:55.653 --> 17:57.318
(GUNFIRE)

18:16.765 --> 18:19.116
He's either reloading,
or I laced one in there.

18:19.277 --> 18:21.435
Only one way to find out.

18:24.247 --> 18:25.680
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)

18:30.023 --> 18:31.891
Nice shooting.

18:32.254 --> 18:35.155
(EXPLOSION)

18:35.224 --> 18:36.824
CLAY: We heard the blast right after

18:36.893 --> 18:38.325
we confirmed our shooter dead.

18:38.394 --> 18:40.093
So what do you say, Vic Jagger?

18:40.162 --> 18:42.029
Huh? You have enough time to
put your dance partner down

18:42.097 --> 18:43.631
before he pulled the pin?

18:43.699 --> 18:45.181
Well, after he squirted,
I pressed forward

18:45.182 --> 18:46.634
to a barricade while engaging.

18:46.702 --> 18:48.869
(GRUNTING)

19:02.751 --> 19:04.451
JASON: <i>Any chance you left him injured?</i>

19:04.520 --> 19:06.886
VIC: <i>No way. Five rounds, center mass.</i>

19:06.955 --> 19:08.621
Stitched him up hard.

19:08.690 --> 19:11.124
RAY:
It sounds like any enemy we engaged,

19:11.193 --> 19:12.325
they're all accounted for.

19:12.394 --> 19:14.161
Yeah, well, there goes that theory.

19:14.229 --> 19:15.628
CLAY: I'm out of ideas.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.198
SONNY: Well, there ain't
no Zapruder film to help us.

19:18.267 --> 19:22.253
All we have is a known unknown.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.896
RAY: So all we can confirm is...

19:24.057 --> 19:28.375
is that I threw the crash,
and the room exploded... right?

19:36.632 --> 19:38.822
Keep at it. (CLEARS THROAT)

19:39.016 --> 19:41.496
Work the problem.

19:49.930 --> 19:52.231
Hey... what's going on?

19:52.300 --> 19:56.402
I always carry two crashes
and one homewrecker.

19:56.471 --> 20:00.005
But when we re-orged,
we were in such a rush,

20:00.074 --> 20:01.707
I don't remember what I grabbed.

20:01.775 --> 20:03.909
You grabbed what you usually grab, Ray.

20:05.913 --> 20:07.580
Yeah.

20:08.818 --> 20:11.117
- That's what I'm afraid of.
- Why?

20:11.185 --> 20:14.587
I'm looking through my gear, and...

20:14.655 --> 20:16.855
I only see one crash.

20:18.438 --> 20:20.425
I have no idea what I went
through that door with.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.164
They're both cylindrical,

20:24.370 --> 20:26.366
- similar in size...
- Stop, stop, stop.

20:26.367 --> 20:27.699
Don't go there, man. All right?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.968
Look, there's no way you
make that rookie mistake.

20:30.037 --> 20:32.137
There's no other explanation, J.

20:32.205 --> 20:33.972
There's something we're
not seeing right now.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.940
So... relax.

20:36.249 --> 20:38.176
It's staring us right in the face.

20:40.380 --> 20:43.381
I threw a damn homewrecker,
and I blew up the room.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.720
I killed Dr. Craig.

21:04.050 --> 21:06.050
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

21:12.225 --> 21:16.793
So, um... Ray thinks he
knows what caused the blast.

21:16.862 --> 21:19.163
Let me guess.

21:19.232 --> 21:21.132
Cerberus got into the cheese again.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.633
Boom.

21:22.701 --> 21:25.636
He thinks he threw a homewrecker.

21:25.704 --> 21:27.704
- Instead of his crash?
- JASON: Yeah.

21:27.773 --> 21:29.039
Nah.

21:29.108 --> 21:31.630
No, there's no way in hell Ray
would do something like that.

21:31.631 --> 21:32.650
JASON: Yeah, well, you know what?

21:32.678 --> 21:35.646
I tried to convince him of that,
but he-he thinks he did.

21:35.714 --> 21:38.682
I hate to say it, but it tracks
with the size of the blast.

21:39.718 --> 21:42.819
CLAY: No. There's no way, man.

21:42.888 --> 21:44.522
I'm not buying it.

21:44.590 --> 21:46.523
What happens to Ray if it's true?

21:46.591 --> 21:47.991
CLAY: Toss a homewrecker

21:48.060 --> 21:50.060
in a room with a hostage?

21:50.129 --> 21:52.195
I mean, it's a career ender, right?

21:52.264 --> 21:53.630
Yeah.

21:53.699 --> 21:55.699
Done. It's over.

21:58.424 --> 22:00.003
SONNY: Whiskey.

22:00.072 --> 22:02.005
Tango.

22:02.074 --> 22:05.742
- Foxtrot.
- CLAY: That doesn't make any sense, man.

22:07.312 --> 22:09.379
I mean, Ray sets the bar.

22:09.447 --> 22:11.014
That kind of thing isn't supposed...

22:11.083 --> 22:12.883
Those types of mistakes don't happen.

22:12.951 --> 22:15.018
Operators get hurt.

22:15.087 --> 22:16.687
Killed. Retire, whatever.

22:16.755 --> 22:19.322
But getting your Trident pulled?

22:19.391 --> 22:23.660
- Brutal way to go out.
- SONNY: Yeah, I'd rather suck start my own secondary

22:23.728 --> 22:25.761
than have Ray kicked off Command.

22:25.830 --> 22:29.632
- We got to do something.
- SONNY: Damn straight we do.

22:30.635 --> 22:31.901
We're going shields up.

22:31.969 --> 22:33.236
Old-school teams.

22:33.305 --> 22:35.538
Burning a great team guy

22:35.607 --> 22:37.740
ain't ever gonna bring Dr. Craig
back from the dead.

22:37.809 --> 22:39.041
Ever.

22:39.110 --> 22:40.543
So we're gonna do everything

22:40.612 --> 22:42.912
in our damn power to make sure
we keep Ray out of the fire.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.281
Yeah. Get our stories straight,

22:45.350 --> 22:48.518
hold fast, weather the storm.

22:50.522 --> 22:51.588
VIC: I'm in.

22:51.656 --> 22:53.656
All we can do.

23:02.299 --> 23:04.733
MANDY: I shouldn't have
cut things so close.

23:04.801 --> 23:07.569
I pushed too hard to get Dr. Craig.

23:07.638 --> 23:10.939
Eh, you were just looking
out for your asset.

23:11.007 --> 23:13.575
I should've been looking out for Bravo.

23:13.644 --> 23:15.644
I should've canked the op.

23:20.517 --> 23:23.051
I manipulated Dr. Craig.

23:23.120 --> 23:27.456
I leveraged him to collect Intel for me.

23:27.524 --> 23:32.260
I pushed him to stay longer
than he thought was safe.

23:32.328 --> 23:37.382
I used every tool in my
toolkit to exploit him...

23:37.567 --> 23:40.969
and he's dead
because he trusted me.

23:41.037 --> 23:43.772
Now I've taken Ray down, too.

23:44.589 --> 23:46.174
And for what?

23:46.243 --> 23:48.476
Like any of this is
gonna make a difference.

23:48.544 --> 23:49.911
You know, I'm not afraid to get shot.

23:49.980 --> 23:51.913
Not afraid to get killed.

23:51.982 --> 23:55.650
But what scares the hell out
of me is letting my team down.

23:55.718 --> 23:57.585
I did that.

23:59.969 --> 23:59.968
I set up my team to fail,

23:59.222 --> 24:02.356
and Ray is paying the price.

24:03.393 --> 24:05.526
(EXHALES)

24:05.595 --> 24:07.094
VIC: <i>Okay, so,</i>

we've got S-vests,
we've got demolition on target,

24:10.565 --> 24:14.168
and we've got an unknown number
of external enemy forces.

24:14.236 --> 24:15.836
Muddy the waters, keep it chaotic

24:15.905 --> 24:17.537
so no one knows what the hell happened.

24:17.606 --> 24:18.772
Yeah.

24:18.841 --> 24:20.974
Just need to convince Ray to stay quiet

24:21.043 --> 24:22.176
about his homewrecker theory.

24:22.244 --> 24:24.544
And which one of you gonna do that?

24:24.613 --> 24:25.779
SONNY: Ray,

24:25.848 --> 24:28.282
just let us cover for you, man.

24:28.350 --> 24:29.482
You mean lie.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.285
VIC: It's not lying.

24:31.353 --> 24:33.153
We just won't paint the full picture.

24:33.222 --> 24:35.122
It's not worth nuking your career over.

24:35.191 --> 24:37.324
Have any of you been
reading the paper lately?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.159
Every other week there's a
new story about the teams.

24:39.228 --> 24:42.628
Abusing prisoners, drug scandals,

24:42.697 --> 24:43.963
frogmen getting accused of war crimes.

24:44.032 --> 24:45.198
There's bad apples in every bunch, Ray,

24:45.266 --> 24:46.398
and you ain't one of them.

24:46.467 --> 24:47.800
And I won't let it be you, either.

24:47.869 --> 24:50.870
This is how those incidents start.

24:50.939 --> 24:52.839
Right here, right now.

24:52.907 --> 24:54.473
Bravo spins out some lie about a hostage

24:54.542 --> 24:55.908
getting killed and gets caught?

24:55.977 --> 24:57.643
That's front-page news
that'll get you all drummed

24:57.712 --> 24:59.478
out of the damn Navy.

24:59.547 --> 25:00.913
We're not asking you to lie.

25:00.982 --> 25:03.216
I know what you're asking me to do.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.851
And I love you for it.

25:04.919 --> 25:09.088
But if you sacrifice your
honor out of loyalty to me,

25:09.157 --> 25:10.923
our Tridents don't mean a damn thing.

25:10.992 --> 25:12.591
Stop it.

25:16.830 --> 25:17.996
Ray.

25:18.065 --> 25:20.031
Ray, hey. Hey, come on, man.

25:20.100 --> 25:22.100
You deserve better than this.

25:23.270 --> 25:25.470
Deserve what I deserve.

25:32.312 --> 25:33.678
ERIC: All right, I hate to be the one

25:33.747 --> 25:35.446
to do this,
but we need to take a step back

25:35.515 --> 25:37.249
from the Senior Chief
Perry issue and focus on

25:37.317 --> 25:40.218
on what we did and didn't
do right during the op.

25:40.287 --> 25:42.754
We're all gonna have
to debrief the Command.

25:42.822 --> 25:45.723
Reps from Langley are already
waiting in Virginia Beach.

25:45.792 --> 25:47.725
Yeah.

25:47.794 --> 25:49.694
If we had successfully
rescued Dr. Craig,

25:49.763 --> 25:51.462
none of this would be an issue,

25:51.531 --> 25:53.698
but the failure added to
the fact that we ran an op

25:53.767 --> 25:55.966
without ISR overwatch or comms

25:56.035 --> 25:58.469
is gonna open us up to a
whole lot of questions.

25:58.538 --> 26:02.239
Now, when exactly did we
shut down comms with Bravo?

26:02.308 --> 26:04.308
Davis.

26:06.946 --> 26:09.714
I-I shut the link when
we left the clinic.

26:09.783 --> 26:12.216
And that's when we
pulled ISR off target?

26:12.285 --> 26:14.151
I'm gonna have to check, sir.

26:14.220 --> 26:16.153
Uh, it's a little fuzzy.

26:16.222 --> 26:19.710
Okay, we'll pull up the logs
and check the time stamps.

26:25.531 --> 26:26.897
I can't remember what I did.

26:26.965 --> 26:30.266
You were concussed. It's okay.

26:30.335 --> 26:32.803
I'll figure out when ISR left target.

26:32.871 --> 26:35.639
If there was ISR over target,

26:35.707 --> 26:37.307
this could make things
a lot worse for Ray.

26:37.375 --> 26:40.076
If that footage exists,

26:40.145 --> 26:42.479
it can't see the light of day.

26:47.686 --> 26:49.853
SONNY: You're making a mistake, Ray.

26:51.990 --> 26:54.524
RAY: No, Sonny, I <i> made</i> a mistake.

26:54.593 --> 26:56.659
What the hell's wrong with you, man?

26:56.727 --> 26:58.494
Huh?

26:58.563 --> 27:01.831
You think you're better
than all of us? That it?

27:01.899 --> 27:03.666
Hell no.

27:03.734 --> 27:06.879
Just that the teams need
to be better than this.

27:09.174 --> 27:11.640
When you pull your foot
out of a bucket of water,

27:11.709 --> 27:14.042
it don't leave a hole.

27:14.111 --> 27:16.378
Goes right back in.

27:18.716 --> 27:21.283
But not this time, Ray, you...

27:21.352 --> 27:24.620
We can't replace you.

27:24.689 --> 27:26.989
You guys will be fine.

27:27.057 --> 27:31.058
You know, people always ask me
why it is that I-I do this job.

27:32.829 --> 27:36.464
And it ain't about the fighting,
it ain't about the brotherhood.

27:36.533 --> 27:40.234
It's about you, it's about Clay,
it's about Jason,

27:40.303 --> 27:44.572
together, brotherhood,
doing what we do best.

27:44.641 --> 27:47.208
And-and you take that away, and...

27:47.276 --> 27:49.811
Ray, I don't know what the
point of all this is, then.

27:50.705 --> 27:53.648
We all got a line we can't cross, Sonny.

27:53.717 --> 27:55.383
This one's mine.

27:55.451 --> 27:58.653
Nobody wins here, Ray.

27:58.722 --> 28:00.488
What, this truth just suddenly makes up

28:00.557 --> 28:03.391
for 18 years of warfare?

28:04.994 --> 28:07.832
I couldn't ask for a
more loyal teammate.

28:08.631 --> 28:11.565
And there's nobody I'd
rather have backing me up.

28:12.301 --> 28:14.556
But this is my decision.

28:15.337 --> 28:17.337
So back me up on it.

28:25.780 --> 28:28.781
Wait, Ray, you don't,
you don't have to do this, okay?

28:28.850 --> 28:31.451
Sonny's right, it's just war.
I've seen way worse swept under the rug.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.685
If I let you all lie for me,

28:32.754 --> 28:34.687
then I fail in the role

28:34.756 --> 28:36.289
that's been handed to me by the team.

28:36.358 --> 28:39.292
If I let the brotherhood's
loyalty sacrifice our honor,

28:39.361 --> 28:40.826
then I don't deserve to be here.

28:41.881 --> 28:47.300
And if I have to leave to
preserve Bravo's dignity...

28:48.927 --> 28:51.625
young brother, so be it.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.140
PILOT: On our final approach.

28:55.209 --> 28:57.777

I should never have gone
after Dr. Craig. It was...

30:20.926 --> 30:23.794
Bravo was too deep in
the red and I pressed it.

30:23.863 --> 30:26.363

We did our best, just like we always do.

30:26.431 --> 30:27.597
Yeah.

30:29.635 --> 30:31.501
Uh, you know what, you went warrant,

30:31.570 --> 30:35.305
you went warrant for me and Bravo,

30:35.374 --> 30:36.907

35:00.226 --> 35:02.061
We should string you up, kid.

35:02.142 --> 35:03.327
SONNY: You were gonna let Ray hang.

35:03.396 --> 35:04.963
Coward! Come here!

35:05.031 --> 35:07.456
(GRUNTING): Come here!

35:13.507 --> 35:16.140
CLAY: So Ray convinces
Jason to draft you.

35:16.209 --> 35:18.977
Sits around,
listens to your BS little sob stories,

35:19.045 --> 35:20.344
and this is how you repay him?

35:20.413 --> 35:22.046
All my times on the teams,

35:22.115 --> 35:24.816
I've never seen anything like this, Vic.

35:24.885 --> 35:27.485
I'll let Command know
that we have an answer.

35:27.554 --> 35:29.653
This is ugly.

35:29.722 --> 35:32.323
But probably a justified action,

35:32.392 --> 35:37.328
given that Vic did not know
Dr. Craig was in that room.

35:38.131 --> 35:40.764
I'll leave you to sort out the rest.

35:50.109 --> 35:52.343
(DOOR CLOSES)

35:52.412 --> 35:53.710
JASON: What do you have
to say for yourself?

35:53.779 --> 35:55.524
No lies.

35:59.452 --> 36:00.751
Look...

36:00.819 --> 36:03.320
I knew there were vests on target.

36:03.389 --> 36:06.056
But I didn't have an
angle on the shooter.

36:06.970 --> 36:09.466
I had to do something.

36:10.595 --> 36:12.495
And I didn't know Dr.
Craig was in the room.

36:12.564 --> 36:14.097
So I threw a homewrecker.

36:14.166 --> 36:16.032
Throwing a homewrecker's
the least of your worries.

36:16.101 --> 36:17.534
You left Ray hanging in the wind.

36:17.602 --> 36:19.369
CLAY: To take the heat
on a career ender.

36:19.438 --> 36:21.071
No. When the S-vest theory took shape,

36:21.139 --> 36:23.573
it seemed like nobody would get blamed.

36:23.641 --> 36:24.574
- But things spiraled...
- JASON: Spiraled?

36:24.642 --> 36:26.376
Spiraled?

36:26.445 --> 36:28.411
You buried the one man

36:28.480 --> 36:30.547
who brought you onto Bravo.

36:30.615 --> 36:31.548
Get out.

36:31.616 --> 36:33.083
- VIC: N-No, I...
- Get. Out.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.791
Get out.

36:35.556 --> 36:37.811
Stand by outside.

37:10.571 --> 37:13.188
What the hell are we gonna
do with this kid, huh?

37:13.269 --> 37:15.624
I got a shovel and a
bag of lye in my car.

37:15.692 --> 37:17.726
Death's the easy way out.

37:17.794 --> 37:20.496
Kid's gonna have to
live with this shame.

37:20.564 --> 37:22.097
We've got to punish him somehow.

37:22.166 --> 37:26.099
Question is...
how severe the penalty should be.

37:26.421 --> 37:29.404
CLAY: Always knew this kid
was shady, man.

37:29.473 --> 37:32.501
Blue Falcon finally exposed
himself for who he really is.

37:32.702 --> 37:36.044
TRENT: Letting Ray think
he killed Dr. Craig is unforgiveable.

37:36.205 --> 37:37.976
We got to take his bird, right?

37:38.218 --> 37:39.829
18 years on the team,

37:39.990 --> 37:42.325
I've never had to rip a Trident off.

37:42.888 --> 37:45.254
SONNY: Kid's roadkill.

37:45.322 --> 37:47.756
My biggest fear is losing Bravo.

37:47.824 --> 37:49.858
He ain't ever gonna shake that.

37:49.926 --> 37:52.426
I just had to live with the
thought of losing Bravo.

37:52.495 --> 37:55.163
I... I don't wish it on anyone.

37:55.231 --> 37:57.999
I mean, do, do we have to kick
him off the team for good?

37:58.068 --> 37:59.467
I mean, what other punishments exist?

37:59.536 --> 38:01.469
Bust him down a rank.

38:01.538 --> 38:03.038
Can't get much lower than new guy.

38:03.106 --> 38:05.373
TRENT: Send him to the fleet
for a disciplinary review?

38:05.441 --> 38:09.110
Or he could do, uh,
the marine mammal program.

38:09.179 --> 38:12.425
In about a year, he'd be back
on Bravo if he redeems himself.

38:12.426 --> 38:14.419
CLAY: How-how can you
possibly redeem yourself

38:14.420 --> 38:15.307
after something like this?

38:16.107 --> 38:18.653
This isn't fog of war, man,
this is, this is a guy putting himself

38:18.722 --> 38:19.888
ahead of the team.

38:19.956 --> 38:21.189
All right, look, you know what, Ray?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.523
He stuck a knife in your back.

38:22.592 --> 38:24.763
You're gonna have to make the call.

38:24.924 --> 38:27.027
Trent? Go get Vic. Bring him in.

38:48.841 --> 38:51.539
VIC: I should have owned up
to what I did.

38:51.780 --> 38:54.088
But I never intended for Ray
to take the fall for this.

38:54.156 --> 38:55.835
You have a funny way of showing that.

38:55.836 --> 38:57.350
JASON: Yeah, you were gonna let Ray wear it

38:57.351 --> 39:02.829
- till that ISR footage showed up.
- You're right.

39:02.897 --> 39:05.630
Ray's a great man.

39:06.436 --> 39:09.616
A better mentor and
the perfect teammate.

39:09.904 --> 39:11.070
He deserved better.

39:11.139 --> 39:14.408
SONNY: You ain't here to sell us on Ray.

39:14.730 --> 39:18.112
Your ass is on the line right now.

39:19.843 --> 39:22.281
Bravo's given me family

39:22.350 --> 39:25.384
and a sense of belonging
that I've been looking for

39:25.453 --> 39:27.954
my whole life.

39:28.837 --> 39:32.460
When I heard that Dr. Craig
was dead because of me...

39:34.272 --> 39:36.629
I figured I'd lose my brothers, too,

39:36.697 --> 39:38.396
if I took the fall.

39:38.465 --> 39:42.267
What, so you were okay with
letting Ray lose his brothers instead?

39:42.335 --> 39:44.202
I panicked.

39:45.304 --> 39:48.766
Made the worst decision of my life.

39:50.177 --> 39:53.611
I don't deserve to be
your teammate, Ray.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.295
And I'm sorry.

39:57.785 --> 40:00.765
It was my fault.

40:01.621 --> 40:03.121
I should've taught you better, kid.

40:04.930 --> 40:08.093
You should've known this team
would've went shields up to protect you.

40:08.909 --> 40:12.008
That's what the brotherhood's all about.

40:12.572 --> 40:15.632
What binds us together
more than anything?

40:15.701 --> 40:19.779
- Trust.
- RAY: That's right. That's right.

40:20.745 --> 40:22.572
Gives us a bond that
nobody outside of this team

40:22.641 --> 40:24.108
could possibly fathom.

40:24.177 --> 40:25.810
VIC: It does.

40:31.684 --> 40:34.197
You're a good man, Vic.

40:35.721 --> 40:37.855
And you got a pure soul.

40:37.924 --> 40:39.790
You've been counted out by this world,

40:39.859 --> 40:42.659
and you've done your very
best to prove the world wrong.

40:45.331 --> 40:47.463
And nobody knows more than I
do that we should not be judged

40:47.532 --> 40:49.498
on our worst moments.

41:05.078 --> 41:07.712
I forgive you. Come here.

41:09.162 --> 41:12.588
Thank you, Ray. Thank you.

41:15.322 --> 41:17.894
But I don't trust you.

41:21.361 --> 41:23.365
I can't let my teammates go
outside the wire with you

41:23.433 --> 41:24.532
if you don't have their backs.

41:24.601 --> 41:28.403
No, I... I always will, okay?

41:28.472 --> 41:31.266
Bravo's my family.

41:35.050 --> 41:38.231
You have my word. My bond.

41:38.432 --> 41:40.566
No...

41:40.951 --> 41:44.673
You shattered that bond.

41:46.887 --> 41:49.258
Your time with Bravo Team's over.

42:12.172 --> 42:14.145
I'm sorry.

42:14.426 --> 42:16.963
Get out.

42:24.527 --> 42:27.928
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:27.996 --> 42:29.896
- Hardest thing I ever had to do.
- Yeah.

42:29.965 --> 42:32.565
Ripped away what he held
closest to his heart.

42:32.634 --> 42:34.567
You had no choice.

42:34.636 --> 42:37.203
Wearing the Trident, it's not a right.

42:37.272 --> 42:39.074
It's a damn privilege.

42:39.316 --> 42:41.207
Right.

42:41.276 --> 42:43.209
- Come on.
- Yeah, brother.
