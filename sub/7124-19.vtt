I can't do this, man!
It just can't be over!

00:51.366 --> 00:54.327
Hey! We can put it back in the
fridge if you want.

00:54.403 --> 00:57.497
No, these picks were made by
our friend to be mouth-loved.

00:57.742 --> 01:02.274
We have to honor his memory with
a final taste of his genius.

01:02.341 --> 01:04.790
Get ready for the dream ritual.

01:06.515 --> 01:10.751
Om! Prismo, we love
you, forever in our dreams!

01:10.818 --> 01:12.480
Prismo, we love you,
forever in our dreams!

01:12.547 --> 01:14.224
Prismo, we love you,
forever in our dreams!

01:14.291 --> 01:16.002
Pickle rama! Pickle rama!

01:16.069 --> 01:19.004
- Pickle rama! Pickle rama!
- Finale!

01:20.062 --> 01:24.933
Ommmmmmmm!

01:25.021 --> 01:27.109
Wulp!

01:28.036 --> 01:30.639
- Woof! What was that?
- Quick! To bed!

01:30.706 --> 01:33.297
This has to be the last
thing we think about!

01:33.975 --> 01:38.104
- Hyah!
- Okay... Dream!

01:45.241 --> 01:46.693
Ah!

01:49.158 --> 01:52.979
Whoo! Crazy dream, man.
Prismo was definitely in it.

01:53.046 --> 01:56.837
But... Jake?
You up already?

01:59.799 --> 02:01.438
What the...

02:03.104 --> 02:07.283
Hup! Ouf! I love you,
everything burrito.

02:07.350 --> 02:09.036
Jake, why are you
pretending to dig up

02:09.103 --> 02:11.232
- everything burrito?
- Huh? What?

02:11.299 --> 02:12.618
Hold on!
I'm coming down.

02:12.685 --> 02:14.607
Wuagh!

02:14.758 --> 02:17.886
Jake, you got
to hear my dream. Jake?

02:17.953 --> 02:20.388
Hey, man!
You're shaking it all wrong.

02:20.455 --> 02:22.714
- What the jump?
- Shh!

02:22.781 --> 02:27.776
Let me show you how it's done.

02:29.224 --> 02:30.828
Jake, are you sleepwalking?

02:30.895 --> 02:34.004
No, I'm showing this...
Wuaaghh!

02:34.133 --> 02:37.190
Waah! Wake... Up!

02:37.306 --> 02:40.692
- Tunk. I'm not dreaming.
- You made an oath. Okay.

02:40.759 --> 02:43.309
- Waa!
- Nah, I'll just stretch into a tree.

02:43.376 --> 02:45.347
Jake! I saw you explode.

02:45.414 --> 02:47.402
Something messed
up is haps, bro.

02:47.809 --> 02:49.408
Please! Not even.

02:49.475 --> 02:51.637
No, dude, you blew into
chunks right over there.

02:51.704 --> 02:54.689
Uh, because kee-oth
was right there.

02:54.756 --> 02:57.419
And there were traps.
And I didn't have no blood this

02:57.486 --> 02:59.552
whole time, so I'm
totally out of it.

03:00.799 --> 03:03.196
Jake, this already happened.
Come on, man!

03:03.263 --> 03:05.825
- Stop freaking me out.
- Wuagh!

03:07.254 --> 03:08.730

03:27.945 --> 03:30.119
Dude, what is the deal?

03:31.008 --> 03:34.165
Dude, I can't wait to get this
batch of pickles to Jake.

03:34.232 --> 03:37.180
He's totes gonna bust a pipe
when he gets hit with the cumin

03:37.247 --> 03:39.628
and the undertones of
sage that come in later.

03:39.695 --> 03:43.021
Prismo, I'm right here!
Where you going, bro?

03:43.402 --> 03:47.035
Wait up, man! How are you alive?
Finn and I saw your old-man host

03:47.102 --> 03:49.083
body get destroyed by the...

03:49.845 --> 03:53.094
- The lich?!
- Wake up!

03:53.469 --> 03:56.010
Wait! I've changed my mind!

03:57.287 --> 03:58.400
Wait!

03:58.468 --> 04:01.557
Why is this happening?
It's like a rerun of the worst junk.

04:01.624 --> 04:05.990
The lich life-sucks Prismo's dream
host, which eliminates Prismo forever.

04:06.057 --> 04:09.809
Ugh! It's mad griz, bro.
And then the space police,

04:09.876 --> 04:12.897
or whatever they're called show
up because boppin' Prismo was

04:12.964 --> 04:15.466
a cosmic crime. I remember
feeling like someone

04:15.533 --> 04:18.341
had peeled a layer away from my
brain, and my reality was no

04:18.409 --> 04:20.255
longer anchored to
any point of reference.

04:20.322 --> 04:23.128
And I had to fight to keep from
being crushed under the weight

04:23.195 --> 04:26.311
of an unforgiving new
paradigm of ultimate reality.

04:26.378 --> 04:28.817
- Ouf!
- So cool, man!

04:28.884 --> 04:31.289
So why am I seeing this again?

04:39.595 --> 04:42.836
- Uh... That's cool.
- Uh, that's cool.

04:42.903 --> 04:45.939
But you know what's really cool?
Tough-guy contests.

04:46.006 --> 04:48.935
Whoo! Whoo!
Tough boys!

04:49.484 --> 04:52.474
Come on, man!
Tough-guy-contest me!

04:52.541 --> 04:55.793
Okay. It seems like all of Jake's
memories are re-manifesting

04:55.860 --> 04:58.893
themselves, but as soon as I
break their history, it creates

04:58.960 --> 05:01.301
- a paradox and Jake explodes.
- Whoa, Finn!

05:01.368 --> 05:03.953
How'd you get over there?!
Wuagh!

05:04.052 --> 05:07.965
Finn, when I die, my individual
earth consciousness is gonna go

05:08.032 --> 05:10.948
all over everywhere while
glob tallies my deeds.

05:11.015 --> 05:13.288
- What?
- I'm gonna be all around you.

05:13.355 --> 05:16.783
In your nose and
your dreams and socks.

05:16.850 --> 05:19.127
- In your dreams?
- Yeah, that's what I said.

05:19.194 --> 05:21.694
In your dreams.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.599
All this striz happened
when Jake and I tried

05:23.666 --> 05:25.793
to preserve Prismo's
pickles in our dreams.

05:25.860 --> 05:28.000
Something must've changed
when we went to sleep.

05:28.067 --> 05:31.054
So, uh, I just got to hope
that Jake tries to do

05:31.121 --> 05:33.743
the pickle ritual again,
so I can reenact it with him.

05:33.810 --> 05:37.217
Exactly the way it happened?
Maybe? Geez!

05:37.284 --> 05:40.489

05:44.486 --> 05:46.657
I guess I'm headed
towards that door.

05:46.724 --> 05:49.194
Dude, I get out of relationships,
because I don't want to have

05:49.261 --> 05:52.974
a discussion about what we're gonna
have for dinner every night.

05:53.602 --> 05:56.367
All these dudes and
their lady problems.

05:56.571 --> 05:59.372
That's right! Prismo is
nothing but the dream of

05:59.439 --> 06:02.148
- a wrinkly old man.
- What if the whole world

06:02.215 --> 06:05.298
was just some goof's dream?
Man, that would be stupid!

06:05.365 --> 06:09.017
Whoa!
Oh, wait a minute.

06:09.084 --> 06:12.169
What is this?
This couldn't be a...

06:12.236 --> 06:17.230
Oh, grod! Permanent-opposing,
industrial-strength magnetic bed.

06:17.422 --> 06:22.244
Hand-hewn from a single tree.
Oh, man, look at this mattress!

06:22.904 --> 06:24.445
What is it?

06:25.239 --> 06:27.383
Smells like a blend
of cashmere.

06:27.669 --> 06:31.297
Mohair, silk, and wool maybe.
The thread count on this

06:31.364 --> 06:33.771
is in the thousands!
And it's filled with...

06:34.297 --> 06:37.138
Down feathers
of a baby griffin!

06:37.205 --> 06:40.638
That's illegal!
Glass of milk.

06:40.749 --> 06:44.393
This feels like a trap designed
by some kind of sick genius!

06:44.708 --> 06:46.277
Well...

06:46.702 --> 06:49.074
Hats off to you,
sir or madame.

06:49.141 --> 06:53.378
Your trap was a success.
Oh, my blahs!

06:53.445 --> 06:56.756
It's like I'm getting eskimo
kisses from an army of angels!

07:03.772 --> 07:05.687
Whoa, dang! I'm back!

07:05.761 --> 07:07.631
Prismo, we love you,
forever in our dreams.

07:07.698 --> 07:09.315
Prismo, we love you,
forever in our dreams.

07:09.382 --> 07:10.996
Prismo, we love you,
forever in our dreams.

07:11.063 --> 07:14.752
Pickle rama! Pickle rama!
Pickle rama! Pickle rama!

07:14.819 --> 07:19.144
- Finale!
- Ommmmmmmm.

07:19.211 --> 07:21.469
Wulp!

07:24.988 --> 07:27.665
- Woof! What was that?
- Quick! To bed!

07:27.732 --> 07:30.068
This has to be the last
thing we think about!

07:30.496 --> 07:34.605
- Hyah!
- Okay... Dream!

07:39.883 --> 07:42.424
Whoa! The pickle jar!

07:43.774 --> 07:45.379
I'm coming, Jake!

07:47.983 --> 07:51.054
- Whoa! Where the heck am I?
- Wait up, man!

07:51.121 --> 07:52.938
- How are you alive?
- Jake?!

07:53.005 --> 07:54.252
I'm coming, man!

07:54.319 --> 07:56.827
Finn and I saw your old-man
host body get destroyed by the...

07:56.894 --> 07:58.005
Jake! Don't explode!

07:58.072 --> 08:00.049
- Finn, hold up.
- Prismo!

08:00.116 --> 08:02.921
- I saw you die, dude!
- Yeah, I'm still dead.

08:02.988 --> 08:05.050
I'm actually talking
to you from the past.

08:05.117 --> 08:09.070
I set up this plan "B" scenario in
case I ever got croaked for reals.

08:09.137 --> 08:11.002
So if this is happening,
I guess I got croaked

08:11.069 --> 08:13.497
and my pickles ran out,
but Jake and I established

08:13.564 --> 08:17.247
a bro bond that could bring
me back through his dreams.

08:17.479 --> 08:19.869
So are you
actually talking to me right now,

08:19.936 --> 08:22.321
or are you pretending
to in an empty room?

08:22.388 --> 08:25.572
I was pretending,
but now I can see you.

08:25.653 --> 08:27.331
What does "now" mean to you?

08:27.398 --> 08:30.403
Uh... Hurry up!
I need your help.

08:31.927 --> 08:35.710
Where you going, bro?
Wait up, man! How are you alive?

08:35.831 --> 08:38.008
- So, where are we going?
- You got to wake up Jake,

08:38.075 --> 08:41.770
- and then... You'll see.
- I'll see what, Prismo?

08:41.837 --> 08:43.990
Oh, shoot!
I don't know if I thought this

08:44.057 --> 08:46.268
- thing all the way through.
- What?

08:46.335 --> 08:49.383
Aw, d... It'll be cool.
It'll be cool.

08:51.491 --> 08:53.748
Dude,
I can't believe I died.

08:53.815 --> 08:56.820
Jake, I'm sorry, man.
This doesn't feel right.

08:56.952 --> 09:00.014
Okay, go wake Jake up
and bring him back here.

09:01.368 --> 09:04.142
Whoa, Finn! Hey!
Are you gonna wake up Jake?

09:04.209 --> 09:05.997
Yeah, is that gonna
kill you again, though?

09:06.064 --> 09:08.296
My past self is
doing plan "B," right?

09:08.363 --> 09:10.152
Uh, yes. Although,
I got to say,

09:10.219 --> 09:12.127
this whole thing seems
rickety as yoga balls.

09:12.194 --> 09:14.870
- Yeah, tell me about it.
- You tell you about it!

09:14.937 --> 09:17.065
I think you would
blow up if I did that.

09:17.132 --> 09:18.990
Well, anyway, here we go!

09:19.057 --> 09:20.685
Hey, Jake, wake up.

09:21.743 --> 09:24.758
- I'm out.
- Hey, Finn!

09:24.825 --> 09:26.975
- What's going on?
- We got to bounce.

09:27.042 --> 09:30.709
Oh, bro! Don't tear
me away from Nirvana.

09:30.776 --> 09:34.452
Wait! Nooooo!
Ouf!

09:35.157 --> 09:37.955
- I'm okay now.
- Cool. This way!

09:39.836 --> 09:42.689
Whoa! Oh, wait a minute.

09:42.756 --> 09:46.768
- What is this?
- Prismo! You're alive!

09:46.835 --> 09:49.610
Well, not yet. Finn,
in a second, you got to

09:49.677 --> 09:52.046
- stop yourself from waking up Jake.
- Stop my who?

09:52.113 --> 09:55.588
Shoot! Hide! Hey, did we get turned
around somewhere? I feel like we're lost.

09:55.655 --> 09:57.691
No, I was just stalling.
Don't think about it.

09:57.758 --> 09:59.328
Come on! This way.

10:01.950 --> 10:03.484
That who!

10:04.603 --> 10:06.763
But wait, Jake!
That means one of your

10:06.830 --> 10:10.785
alternate-reality incarnations will
sleep for eternity to keep me alive.

10:10.852 --> 10:11.926
Cool, dude!

10:11.993 --> 10:15.085
Okay, but, Finn, I'm not sure what'll
happen if you confront yourself.

10:15.152 --> 10:16.398
He might explode.

10:16.465 --> 10:19.701
- He me? Or other me?
- You know what? Forget it.

10:19.768 --> 10:23.018
Shut it, Prismo! Heroes risk
everything for their friends,

10:23.085 --> 10:25.099
although, I admit you're
more Jake's friend than mine.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.955
Sometimes you can think
someone is totally cool,

10:27.022 --> 10:28.376
but you never become besties.

10:28.443 --> 10:30.529
And I don't know why that
happens, but regardless,

10:30.596 --> 10:34.139
- let's do this!
- Good luck!

10:37.018 --> 10:39.679
Whoa, Finn! Hey!
Are you gonna wake up Jake?

10:39.746 --> 10:41.579
Yeah, is that gonna
kill you again, though?

10:41.646 --> 10:43.749
My past self is doing
plan "B," right?

10:43.816 --> 10:46.245
- Plan "B"!
- What the...

10:52.100 --> 10:54.603
This is me?
This sword is me?

10:54.670 --> 10:57.839
- Finn sword, dude.
- Welcome back, Prismo!

10:57.906 --> 11:00.567
- Thank you, Finn.
- Welcome back, Prismo!

11:00.634 --> 11:02.057
Thank you, Jake.
