WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:02.806
It's called Operation Pear Tree.

00:02.807 --> 00:05.246
Our brief was to embed
an undercover officer

00:05.247 --> 00:07.166
within an organised crime group.

00:07.167 --> 00:09.367
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

00:12.268 --> 00:14.347
I'm just trying to get to the truth.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.787
The top brass,
they don't want me to succeed.

00:16.788 --> 00:20.300
There's a bent copper running
organised crime, I'm sure of it.

00:23.341 --> 00:25.267
The man that broke in,
I never saw his face.

00:25.268 --> 00:27.467
He said you'd know why he'd done it.

00:27.740 --> 00:29.529
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.867
He'll make sure I go down,
there's no two ways about it.

00:31.868 --> 00:35.027
One zero to four five.
The order is Fahrenheit.

00:35.028 --> 00:36.827
Sir, we'll lose all of Corbett's intel.

00:36.828 --> 00:39.460
We know that Corbett
is a coldblooded killer.

00:41.660 --> 00:42.867
Give yourself up!

00:42.868 --> 00:45.980
You shoot me, then the truth
never comes out.

00:48.388 --> 00:49.800
Lee Banks?

00:49.825 --> 00:52.238
- Who the hell are you?
- Superintendent Hastings.

00:52.239 --> 00:53.787
You're a rat, John.

00:54.340 --> 00:55.667
A rat.

00:56.359 --> 00:58.127
What if he did blow Corbett's cover?

00:58.460 --> 01:00.108
Doesn't bear thinking about.

01:01.108 --> 01:04.378
- This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
- How much?

01:04.379 --> 01:05.467
£100,000.

01:05.468 --> 01:07.547
Haven't we earned a payday?

01:07.548 --> 01:11.027
I don't want the fiasco of Operation
Pear Tree, which was not of your

01:11.028 --> 01:15.108
making, add a disastrous coda to
an otherwise distinguished career.

01:20.188 --> 01:22.467
Cover it up with all this stuff. Come on.

01:22.468 --> 01:24.667
I never asked you how your exams went.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.708
Yeah, I got a date for my interview.

01:28.108 --> 01:30.867
It's clear to me that the threshold
test has been passed

01:30.868 --> 01:33.787
and therefore it is my lawful right
to arrest you on suspicion

01:33.788 --> 01:36.820
- of conspiracy to murder John Corbett.
- No, no, no.

01:37.900 --> 01:39.316
You will be held in custody

01:39.341 --> 01:41.187
while we gather further
evidence against you.

01:41.188 --> 01:43.980
What is happening here?
I am being framed!

01:46.268 --> 01:47.747
Today was just for starters.

01:47.748 --> 01:50.180
Now I'm going to prove
that Hastings is H.

01:57.340 --> 01:59.267
The inquiry into Superintendent Hastings

01:59.268 --> 02:02.267
is not a matter over which
you're entitled to exercise choice.

02:02.268 --> 02:04.787
Cooperation is your lawful duty
as police officers

02:04.788 --> 02:08.187
and failure to comply is an offence
under police conduct regulations.

02:08.187 --> 02:11.580
Any of you obstructing my officers
can and will face arrest.

02:12.580 --> 02:14.467
But let's not fall out over this.

02:14.900 --> 02:16.988
I'm sure we can all work together nicely.

02:18.300 --> 02:20.580
DI Fleming, DS Arnott,
can I borrow you a minute?

02:22.000 --> 02:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.820 --> 02:31.270
Seven years and counting.

02:31.271 --> 02:33.787
No-one's worked more closely
with Ted Hastings than you two.

02:34.180 --> 02:37.187
You have better insights into
the man than anyone else in AC12.

02:37.188 --> 02:42.220
So, what you know, I need to know,
my team needs to know.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.467
Ma'am, I'm not comfortable
kicking the gaffer when he's down.

02:50.020 --> 02:51.270
He recruited you.

02:51.295 --> 02:52.530
- Yes, ma'am.
- Mm-hm.

02:53.820 --> 02:56.147
Stuck by you when perhaps
some others wouldn't have.

02:56.148 --> 02:59.780
Shagging witnesses and suspects
and the like.

03:01.420 --> 03:04.187
I sympathise with your loyalties,
DS Arnott, I really do,

03:04.188 --> 03:07.467
but on the other hand we have found
£50,000 stashed in his hotel room

03:07.468 --> 03:10.471
so if I were you I wouldn't go round
professing too close a loyalty

03:10.472 --> 03:13.567
to Ted Hastings, otherwise people
might just start suspecting you

03:13.568 --> 03:15.780
of being an accessory to his offences.

03:17.948 --> 03:19.467
H.

03:20.260 --> 03:22.187
A senior police officer
sitting at the top

03:22.188 --> 03:24.747
of an institutionalised relationship

03:25.620 --> 03:29.980
between organised crime
and corrupt police officers.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.880
AC12 failed to bring him down.

03:37.900 --> 03:39.160
I won't.

03:45.380 --> 03:46.520
Wow.

03:49.200 --> 03:50.719
£50,000.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.999
Ma'am, Sarge, can we talk please?

03:53.700 --> 03:55.193
- Sure. What's up?

03:55.218 --> 03:56.479
- I've been looking into
John Corbett's past,

03:56.480 --> 03:59.679
like you asked me to. You said
it was completely confidential

03:59.680 --> 04:03.200
- and I couldn't share it with anyone.
- What have you found?

04:05.400 --> 04:09.199
- May I ask what's going on in here?
- Yeah. A private conversation.

04:09.200 --> 04:12.919
Didn't you hear DCS Carmichael?
We need to know everything.

04:13.340 --> 04:15.200
- It's Michelle, isn't it?
- Yes.

04:15.225 --> 04:16.678
Listen, Michelle, we're AC12.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.519
We do this to other units
week-in-week-out

04:18.519 --> 04:20.119
so don't try telling me how it works.

04:20.120 --> 04:21.999
We're witnesses, not suspects.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.680
Now, stop making a tit of yourself
and piss off.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.599
Sorry. Go on.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.679
It goes back to
Superintendent Hastings' service

04:32.680 --> 04:34.679
with the Royal Ulster Constabulary.

04:34.980 --> 04:38.522
When he was a PC in the 1980s,
he was interviewed in connection

04:38.523 --> 04:41.060
with the disappearance
of Anne-Marie McGillis.

04:42.020 --> 04:43.679
- Corbett's mum?
- Yeah.

04:44.180 --> 04:46.997
- The records aren't brilliant.
- No, they never were in them days.

04:46.998 --> 04:49.679
But they've been retained as
the disappearance remains unsolved.

04:49.680 --> 04:50.797
You've got this on file?

04:50.822 --> 04:53.319
Yes, Sarge,
but I've kept it security protected.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.712
Well done, but I don't want you
getting in trouble

04:55.713 --> 04:59.399
so you should share the file
with DCS Carmichael's team.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.919
Yes, ma'am.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.520
Thank you, ma'am.

05:04.900 --> 05:06.679
Christ's sake, Kate.

05:06.680 --> 05:10.470
I'm just calling it as I see it,
Steve. The truth comes first.

05:10.471 --> 05:12.879
What, we just help Carmichael
hammer nails in the gaffer's coffin?

05:12.880 --> 05:15.359
Well, you heard Carmichael.
If the gaffer is found guilty,

05:15.360 --> 05:17.439
I can guarantee it'll be us
she'll be after next.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.319
"Oh, we must have
known Hastings was bent."

05:19.320 --> 05:22.719
What if the gaffer's innocent?
We'll have betrayed him.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.759
He'll come after us and we'll deserve it.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.679
Well, I don't know about you, Steve,
but I'm not going to sit around

05:27.680 --> 05:29.473
and wait for a kicking off
the gaffer or Carmichael

05:29.474 --> 05:31.100
when there's police work to be done.

05:39.331 --> 05:41.120
Stand clear of the door.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.599
Corbett's murder, Hastings' arrest.

06:00.600 --> 06:03.159
Fortunately, it will all be
covered by our application

06:03.160 --> 06:04.919
for Public Interest Immunity.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.919
Nothing need ever come out.

06:06.920 --> 06:09.479
Unless Carmichael proves
a link between Hastings

06:09.480 --> 06:12.919
and organised crime.
We have to go public with that.

06:13.220 --> 06:15.300
There's pros and cons PR-wise.

06:16.160 --> 06:20.359
Which makes me think we need to
emphasise the wording.

06:20.360 --> 06:21.919
Wording?

06:21.920 --> 06:26.399
Operation Pear Tree's objective
was to examine institutionalised

06:26.400 --> 06:29.679
links between corrupt police
officers and organised criminals.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.679
Most people would prefer us spending
that money reducing response times,

06:33.680 --> 06:36.000
putting more bobbies on the beat.

06:37.340 --> 06:40.999
- Anyway, I'll leave that with you.
- Where are you going?

06:41.380 --> 06:43.319
The inquiry into Superintendent Hastings

06:43.320 --> 06:44.900
must be above reproach.

06:45.940 --> 06:47.840
Wouldn't hurt to make sure.

07:05.400 --> 07:07.720
- This is never easy.
- No.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.679
Sorry for your loss.

07:23.680 --> 07:25.679
We're sorry to have to ask

07:25.680 --> 07:29.159
but we're making further enquiries
into John's undercover operation.

07:29.580 --> 07:30.919
I can't help you.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.420
Not sure I would even if I could.

07:37.460 --> 07:39.000
I met John a few times.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.920
He was a very brave man.

07:45.980 --> 07:48.679
Steph, from what Merseyside Police
have told us

07:48.680 --> 07:51.600
about your reaction to the news
of your husband's death...

07:52.600 --> 07:55.122
...it has made us question some
of the things you said to us

07:55.123 --> 07:56.540
when we was last here.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.080
You're not in any trouble.

08:00.380 --> 08:02.440
We just want to do right by John.

08:09.220 --> 08:10.639
Sit down if you like.

08:11.020 --> 08:12.320
Thank you.

08:20.980 --> 08:22.680
It was all an act before.

08:23.680 --> 08:27.100
John told me that was how to play it
to protect him.

08:29.420 --> 08:32.679
Going back to our visit
on the 10th of March,

08:33.260 --> 08:36.380
we asked you about John's links
to Northern Ireland.

08:38.260 --> 08:39.679
He grew up over there.

08:40.980 --> 08:43.399
When his mum died,
he was took in by his auntie.

08:43.860 --> 08:45.399
Did John ever talk about his mum?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.760
Yeah.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.679
We've got a name, Anne-Marie McGillis.

08:51.020 --> 08:52.679
Anne-Marie, yeah.

08:53.180 --> 08:54.920
What did John say about her?

08:56.160 --> 08:57.999
John never said much.

08:58.380 --> 09:00.679
To be honest, I don't know
how much he ever knew.

09:00.680 --> 09:04.679
He was... He was only a kid when it
all happened, about nine or ten.

09:05.380 --> 09:06.520
When what happened?

09:08.260 --> 09:11.159
The story was Anne-Marie
was helping the police

09:11.160 --> 09:13.600
and then the police betrayed her.

09:14.860 --> 09:18.360
Let on she was an informant
and that's why she got killed.

09:20.500 --> 09:23.360
Did John ever say there was
a particular officer involved?

09:25.380 --> 09:28.399
When he was older,
his auntie said there was one

09:28.400 --> 09:30.479
that Anne-Marie had talked about.

09:30.980 --> 09:32.680
A young fella her age.

09:33.680 --> 09:38.280
I think he took a shine to her and
she trusted him to look out for her.

09:39.740 --> 09:41.680
He should have but he didn't.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.653
Or worse.

09:45.680 --> 09:47.560
What do you mean, worse?

09:48.740 --> 09:50.679
Something John said.

09:50.980 --> 09:54.159
This copper, he was married,
and there was a bit of scandal

09:54.160 --> 09:57.759
about him spending so much time
round Anne-Marie's.

09:58.260 --> 10:00.679
Maybe it suited him
for Anne-Marie to go missing.

10:01.540 --> 10:03.320
Did John have any evidence of this?

10:04.900 --> 10:06.319
Not that I know of.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.686
Was there a name for this officer?

10:09.659 --> 10:11.659
If there was, I never heard it.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.440
Not from John.

10:15.260 --> 10:18.239
Did John ever connect this family
history to the undercover operation

10:18.240 --> 10:20.679
he was involved in
at the time of his death?

10:20.680 --> 10:24.000
John never told me what his jobs
was about for me own protection.

10:25.206 --> 10:26.886
And his.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.040
Why are you so interested in what
happened in Northern Ireland?

10:32.260 --> 10:33.999
Is there a connection?

10:34.500 --> 10:35.680
We don't know.

10:42.400 --> 10:44.919
Corbett never mentioned Hastings
to Steph.

10:44.920 --> 10:47.839
He was only a kid when it happened.
Maybe he never knew the name.

10:47.840 --> 10:50.839
Still, the undercover officer
recruited to investigate

10:50.840 --> 10:53.424
links between the OCG
and corrupt officers,

10:53.425 --> 10:55.239
all the way up to H,
just happens to be the son

10:55.240 --> 10:57.319
of a woman murdered on
the gaffer's patch?

10:57.320 --> 11:00.479
Well, now we know why Corbett was
so convinced the gaffer's bent.

11:00.480 --> 11:03.023
What we don't know is if someone
else knew about Corbett's past link

11:03.024 --> 11:05.401
to the gaffer or if somehow
Corbett managed to put himself

11:05.402 --> 11:07.660
- forward for the job.
- Exactly.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.959
Any chance of it being a coincidence?

11:09.960 --> 11:11.420
Coincidence, my arse.

11:18.080 --> 11:20.079
I see you've cleared everybody out.

11:20.080 --> 11:23.159
That'll save the mutual
embarrassment when I'm reinstated.

11:23.160 --> 11:26.239
DCS Carmichael had concerns
about security.

11:26.240 --> 11:29.320
AC12 had a corrupt DI
who shot his way out of here.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.920
- Did you manage to get any sleep?
- Not much.

11:44.320 --> 11:46.160
Thank you. As you were.

11:48.980 --> 11:51.399
Listen, this heavy mob that
you've just parachuted in,

11:51.400 --> 11:53.479
they look a bit trigger-happy to me.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.719
But our man, Police Sergeant
Kyle Ferringham,

11:55.720 --> 11:57.599
he knows this building inside out,

11:57.600 --> 11:59.679
you will not find a safer pair of hands.

11:59.680 --> 12:01.919
You just said it. He's your man.

12:01.920 --> 12:05.140
I'll stick with mine, thank you.

12:18.140 --> 12:20.919
Second interview of Edward Hastings
in the presence of his solicitor

12:20.920 --> 12:23.359
by DCS Carmichael, DI Brandyce
and PS Tranter.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.919
You remain under caution.

12:24.920 --> 12:27.119
As you know, you may be held for up
to 24 hours,

12:27.120 --> 12:28.640
at which point you will
either be released

12:28.641 --> 12:32.040
or charged with conspiracy
to murder John Corbett.

12:34.039 --> 12:35.759
Pausing interview.

12:37.860 --> 12:40.060
PS Ferringham on official business.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.159
What's going on?

12:44.160 --> 12:47.399
Gill Biggeloe, Senior Legal Counsel
to the PCC, attending

12:47.400 --> 12:51.759
as an official observer to ensure
correct procedures are followed.

12:51.760 --> 12:54.399
- Why wasn't I informed?
- You just were.

12:54.980 --> 12:56.000
Thank you.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.920
Ma'am.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.680
Hi, Ted.

13:13.220 --> 13:17.159
Resuming interview, now with PCC's
Senior Legal Counsel observing.

13:17.160 --> 13:20.995
- Mr Hastings, how did you...?
- I thought, ma'am,

13:21.340 --> 13:24.240
that we had agreed that
I would be addressed by my rank.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.679
Given the gravity of the charge
against you,

13:27.680 --> 13:29.603
I know we'd both hate to be accused
of special treatment.

13:29.604 --> 13:32.319
Best we treat you like
any normal, regular person

13:32.320 --> 13:35.200
who's been accused of plotting
to kill someone, don't you agree?

13:36.680 --> 13:39.239
When did you receive confirmation
that John Corbett

13:39.240 --> 13:41.080
had assaulted your wife?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.559
I'm sorry to probe. I know this must
be extremely upsetting for you.

13:46.560 --> 13:49.679
- On the 12th of March.
- When on the 12th of March?

13:49.940 --> 13:52.260
During the operation to apprehend him.

13:53.893 --> 13:55.213
Oh.

13:55.940 --> 13:57.239
I see.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.159
Talk about a pressure situation.
My heart goes out to you.

14:00.580 --> 14:02.399
To have that trauma
at that very same moment

14:02.400 --> 14:05.260
as being in command of armed
officers surrounding John Corbett.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.919
Still, and, I am sorry about this,

14:07.920 --> 14:10.679
I do need to ask you about
the events that followed.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.079
DI Brandyce.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.399
Document 53 in your folders.

14:14.780 --> 14:16.919
Document 53 is a copy of the report

14:16.920 --> 14:19.399
made by the Tactical Firearms Commander

14:19.400 --> 14:22.039
during said operation
on the 12th of March,

14:22.620 --> 14:24.030
written on the 13th of March

14:24.055 --> 14:27.679
and received later that day by
the Strategic Firearms Commander.

14:27.980 --> 14:32.319
Drawing your attention to page three
of said report, paragraph four,

14:32.740 --> 14:37.199
"Superintendent Hastings relayed
a Fahrenheit order to DS Arnott."

14:37.200 --> 14:39.537
- Did you give said order?
- Yes.

14:39.538 --> 14:41.170
What's your understanding of said order?

14:41.171 --> 14:45.679
The authority to deploy lethal force
to prevent immediate loss of life

14:45.680 --> 14:48.319
or prevent immediate danger
to the public.

14:48.320 --> 14:50.479
Responsibility for issuing said order

14:50.480 --> 14:52.679
lies with the Strategic
Firearms Commander.

14:52.680 --> 14:55.119
For the order to be issued by
any other officer is unlawful.

14:55.120 --> 14:57.679
Corbett had already drawn his firearm,

14:57.980 --> 15:00.359
DS Arnott was facing
an immediate threat to life,

15:00.360 --> 15:02.679
I was concerned that DS Arnott
would hesitate

15:02.680 --> 15:04.649
and that Corbett would discharge
his firearm.

15:04.650 --> 15:07.479
I gave the order to save
my officer's life.

15:07.480 --> 15:12.300
In your mind, having just learned
that Corbett had tortured your wife,

15:12.680 --> 15:16.199
- no other motivations were at work?
- None.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.530
And that he was involved in
the death of one of your officers,

15:18.531 --> 15:20.159
- PC Maneet Bindra?
- Yes.

15:20.160 --> 15:23.319
- You weren't vengeful towards Corbett?
- My first concern remained,

15:23.320 --> 15:26.679
as it should do for all police
officers, the preservation of life.

15:26.680 --> 15:28.879
Clearly you weren't concerned
with the preservation

15:28.880 --> 15:30.959
- of John Corbett's life.
- I did not cause his death.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.877
He brought it upon himself
when he went rogue.

15:32.878 --> 15:34.018
I take no pleasure in this

15:34.019 --> 15:36.320
but the man
had it coming to him in spades.

15:38.400 --> 15:41.159
I'd like to return to the remarks
you made to DS Railston

15:41.620 --> 15:43.399
following the assault on your wife.

15:43.780 --> 15:45.679
That's Document 60 in your folders.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.559
Document 60 is a crime report
by DS Samantha Railston

15:48.560 --> 15:53.279
detailing statements made by
Edward Hastings on the 8th of March.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.879
Page 2, para 3,

15:54.880 --> 15:57.560
"Superintendent Hastings stated,

15:57.561 --> 15:59.639
'Whoever's responsible better
start praying

15:59.640 --> 16:02.359
"'he's up in front of the judge
before I get my hands on him.'"

16:02.360 --> 16:03.780
What did you mean by that?

16:05.760 --> 16:07.279
It was rhetorical.

16:07.280 --> 16:09.519
And what would you have done
if, as per your statement,

16:09.520 --> 16:11.660
you had "got your hands on him"?

16:12.600 --> 16:14.919
I would have done what any police
officer would have done

16:14.920 --> 16:16.759
and arrested him for grievous
bodily harm.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.239
Which sounds like what any
law-abiding officer would do.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.799
Well, I am a law-abiding officer.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.879
And yet, on the 12th of March,
you ordered DS Arnott

16:22.880 --> 16:24.479
to shoot John Corbett in cold blood.

16:24.480 --> 16:26.199
To prevent an immediate loss of life!

16:26.200 --> 16:28.479
And later that same day,
you visited Lee Banks,

16:28.480 --> 16:30.559
an OCG member on remand
in Blackthorn Prison.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.959
Yeah, to harvest information on the OCG.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.599
When DS Arnott quite rightly did not
deploy lethal force against

16:35.600 --> 16:37.879
John Corbett, did you take matters
into your own hands

16:37.880 --> 16:39.466
and disclose to Lee Banks

16:39.467 --> 16:41.519
that John Corbett was
an undercover police officer?

16:41.520 --> 16:43.039
No, I did not.

16:43.040 --> 16:45.839
Disclosing this information with
the expectation that it would be

16:45.840 --> 16:47.460
- passed on to the OCG?
- No!

16:49.720 --> 16:51.519
I'm really sorry to labour something that

16:51.520 --> 16:53.719
I know you find very upsetting,
but I'd like to return

16:53.720 --> 16:56.159
to the injuries that John Corbett
inflicted on your wife.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.319
If you must.

16:57.320 --> 16:58.700
Thank you.

16:59.040 --> 17:02.759
The case was dealt with by
the Serious Crime Unit.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.559
Document 60 in your folders.

17:04.560 --> 17:07.719
Drawing your attention to page 2, para 2,

17:07.720 --> 17:10.999
"When questioned, Superintendent
Hastings denied knowledge of

17:11.000 --> 17:14.559
"any significance to the pattern of
injuries sustained by the victim."

17:14.560 --> 17:17.236
- Is that what you said to DS Railston?
- Yes.

17:17.237 --> 17:19.679
Thank you for being truthful with us.

17:19.680 --> 17:22.358
I can't tell you how much easier
that makes everything.

17:22.359 --> 17:23.559
Now, as part of our inquiry,

17:23.560 --> 17:26.479
we've been given access
to your service record.

17:26.480 --> 17:32.079
The service record is summarised
in Document 2 in your folders.

17:32.080 --> 17:33.559
The service record indicates

17:33.560 --> 17:37.679
Edward Hastings joined the
Royal Ulster Constabulary in 1982

17:37.680 --> 17:40.999
and served as a police constable
for seven years,

17:41.000 --> 17:43.364
till his promotion to Police Sergeant

17:43.365 --> 17:45.439
and transfer in 1989.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.479
Sorry, I don't mean to put you on
the spot, but seven years' policing

17:48.480 --> 17:50.919
in Northern Ireland in the 1980s,
and you never came across

17:50.920 --> 17:54.239
a pattern of injuries that involved
the wrists, knees and ankles?

17:54.240 --> 17:55.359
Yeah, but, look...

17:55.360 --> 17:57.639
You have to remember, my team
had only just discovered

17:57.640 --> 17:58.919
that DS Railston's officer,

17:58.920 --> 18:01.959
Commanding Detective Chief
Superintendent Lester Hargreaves,

18:01.960 --> 18:03.799
was corrupt, having been an accomplice

18:03.800 --> 18:07.679
with the OCG in their armed robbery
of Eastfield Depot.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.079
So, you're offering by way of
an explanation

18:10.080 --> 18:11.959
that you withheld information

18:11.960 --> 18:14.799
for fear of how it would be
misused by Railston?

18:14.800 --> 18:16.839
The assault on my wife
appeared to be the work

18:16.840 --> 18:19.519
of the organised crime group
that we were investigating,

18:19.520 --> 18:24.220
a threat or a warning to me
to suppress the inquiry.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.759
I just didn't want to give them
the satisfaction

18:27.760 --> 18:30.479
of knowing how upsetting
I found the whole event.

18:30.480 --> 18:33.079
So, you did appreciate
the significance of the injuries?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.759
Yes, all right, look, if you want
me to state the obvious.

18:35.760 --> 18:39.519
Yes, a resemblance to punishment
and or torture meted out

18:39.520 --> 18:42.479
by paramilitary and/or terrorist
organisations.

18:42.480 --> 18:45.039
Indeed, so now, let's turn
to your service

18:45.040 --> 18:49.119
with the Royal Ulster Constabulary
in the period 1982-1989, inclusive.

18:49.120 --> 18:51.119
Document 62.

18:51.120 --> 18:54.439
PC Edward Hastings served
in West Belfast.

18:54.440 --> 18:58.999
A periodic professional assessment
submitted in the summer of 1988

18:59.000 --> 19:02.879
by Police Sergeant Thomas Cranford
notes the following,

19:02.880 --> 19:06.519
"Hastings appears to have a rapport
with the Catholic community

19:06.520 --> 19:08.866
"due to his own Catholic tendencies."

19:08.867 --> 19:10.959
Are you able to tell us a little bit
about your background?

19:10.960 --> 19:12.879
Well, I'd really rather not.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.559
A Catholic in the RUC,
were you in the minority?

19:15.560 --> 19:19.359
I was, and am, a police officer.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.879
I do not discriminate
against my fellow officers

19:21.880 --> 19:26.119
on grounds of creed, and I would
appreciate the same courtesy.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.439
Well, the sergeant writing up

19:27.440 --> 19:29.879
that RUC periodic professional assessment

19:29.880 --> 19:31.519
didn't mind referring to it.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.288
Document 62 continued,

19:33.289 --> 19:36.205
"Hastings' family background
is more complicated,

19:36.206 --> 19:38.719
"which may prove valuable
in future assignments."

19:38.720 --> 19:40.267
What did he mean by that?

19:40.268 --> 19:42.919
- You'd have to ask him.
- We did.

19:42.920 --> 19:45.439
Document 65 in your folders.

19:45.440 --> 19:49.679
Statement by former Police Sergeant,
now retired, Thomas Cranford,

19:49.680 --> 19:54.039
submitted to Anticorruption Unit 3
on the 14th of March.

19:54.040 --> 19:56.399
"We all thought he was Protestant.

19:56.400 --> 19:59.439
"Edward and Hastings, what else
is the fella going to be?

19:59.440 --> 20:02.159
"Turned out that was a sensitive subject.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.999
"His old man was a Protestant
but he'd married a Catholic,

20:05.000 --> 20:07.839
"and when he went off, his mum
brought up young Ted that way."

20:07.840 --> 20:09.399
Why did you leave the RUC?

20:09.400 --> 20:10.500
Well...

20:11.080 --> 20:14.020
...the kind of talk we just heard
being quoted didn't help.

20:14.760 --> 20:18.199
In 1989, you suffered serious injuries.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.199
On 29th of June 1989,

20:20.200 --> 20:24.399
an RUC patrol vehicle drove over
a pipe bomb, causing the death

20:24.400 --> 20:29.159
of PC Patrick O'Malley and serious
injury to PC Edward Hastings.

20:29.160 --> 20:31.679
Two Catholic officers targeted?

20:31.680 --> 20:35.039
Yeah, well, it doesn't take a genius
to see why I put in for a transfer.

20:35.040 --> 20:37.120
Or were you targeted for another reason?

20:39.560 --> 20:41.559
I don't know what you're referring to.

20:41.560 --> 20:45.519
I'd like to examine events
in the period 1988-1989

20:45.520 --> 20:49.919
and, specifically, a special
assignment that you took part in.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.759
Do you recognise the name
Anne-Marie McGillis?

20:52.760 --> 20:55.119
For the DIR, I'm showing
the interviewee Image 41,

20:55.120 --> 20:58.420
an RUC file photograph of
Anne-Marie McGillis.

21:01.146 --> 21:02.380
Mr Hastings?

21:06.720 --> 21:08.800
You're going back 30 years here, come on.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.999
Let's see if this can jog your memory.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.639
Document 78 in your folders.

21:14.640 --> 21:18.279
Document 78 is a report entered into
the Royal Ulster Constabulary files

21:18.280 --> 21:22.079
on missing persons,
dated the 23rd of May 1989.

21:22.080 --> 21:27.359
Anne-Marie McGillis was reported
missing on the 19th April 1989.

21:27.360 --> 21:29.959
The night before, Tuesday the 18th April,

21:29.960 --> 21:32.437
Anne-Marie left her son with a neighbour,

21:32.438 --> 21:35.399
informing the neighbour that she was
popping out for a couple of hours

21:35.400 --> 21:36.879
to visit a friend in hospital.

21:36.880 --> 21:39.759
Anne-Marie never returned
to collect her son.

21:39.760 --> 21:42.599
No witnesses came forward
to reveal Anne-Marie's movements

21:42.600 --> 21:44.039
on the night she disappeared.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.879
No-one known to Anne-Marie was able
to identify the family friend

21:46.880 --> 21:48.679
who was admitted in to hospital.

21:48.680 --> 21:51.719
The Missing Persons team concluded
that this person didn't exist,

21:51.720 --> 21:53.959
and that Anne-Marie had deceived
her neighbour

21:53.960 --> 21:56.639
regarding her activities
on the night she disappeared.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.319
A number of individuals known to
Anne-Marie were interviewed

21:59.320 --> 22:01.479
in connection with
the Missing Persons inquiry.

22:01.480 --> 22:05.199
And one such individual was
Police Constable Edward Hastings.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.759
Do you recall these events, Mr Hastings?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.799
Some.

22:08.800 --> 22:10.080
What do you recall?

22:11.480 --> 22:15.759
Well, Anne-Marie's husband had been
murdered a few years before.

22:15.760 --> 22:19.479
Apparently, he was active
during the Troubles.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.599
One of those nasty little
tit-for-tat killings.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.759
Anyway, Anne-Marie,

22:23.760 --> 22:26.679
she blamed someone higher up
the chain of command

22:26.680 --> 22:29.300
for her husband's death, you know...

22:29.640 --> 22:31.759
She felt that he was sacrificed
needlessly.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.540
Anyway, grief, I think...

22:36.240 --> 22:39.199
...later turned to passing
information to the police

22:39.200 --> 22:41.439
about terrorist activities.

22:41.440 --> 22:44.693
- She was an CHIS informant?
- Yes.

22:44.694 --> 22:47.439
And did you play a role in
Anne-Marie serving as a CHIS?

22:47.440 --> 22:49.919
Yes, well, she...
Look, she lived on my patch.

22:49.920 --> 22:51.519
You know, in those days,

22:51.520 --> 22:54.280
it was very difficult for the RUC
to enter certain areas, to er...

22:55.640 --> 22:57.119
...to put it mildly.

22:57.120 --> 22:59.959
And I think some local women
found out my mother was a Catholic

22:59.960 --> 23:01.559
and that I was a Catholic too.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.519
And I think that bought a bit of trust.

23:03.520 --> 23:05.799
You were instrumental in Anne-Marie
trusting the police

23:05.800 --> 23:08.639
with information she was disclosing
about terrorist organisations?

23:08.640 --> 23:10.199
I helped, that's all.

23:10.200 --> 23:12.280
Did you have meetings with Mrs McGillis?

23:13.540 --> 23:15.393
- Some.
- According to the file,

23:15.394 --> 23:17.639
you didn't always meet Anne-Marie
in covert locations.

23:17.640 --> 23:19.639
You were seen entering
and leaving her home.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.079
Yes, you know, I'd give her a hand.

23:22.080 --> 23:24.480
Little odd jobs,
there was no man about the house.

23:26.000 --> 23:29.479
I'm no expert in RUC covert tactics
in the 1980s,

23:29.480 --> 23:31.359
but I would have thought that
making it appear

23:31.360 --> 23:33.359
that a young woman
from a Republican community

23:33.360 --> 23:35.519
has some kind of friendship
with a police officer

23:35.520 --> 23:36.919
is only going to invite trouble.

23:36.920 --> 23:39.599
The sort of trouble that might
get you targeted by a pipe bomb,

23:39.600 --> 23:41.879
or get your lady friend murdered.

23:41.880 --> 23:43.719
I object to the term "lady friend".

23:43.720 --> 23:45.360
What level of friendship was it?

23:47.320 --> 23:48.639
What do you mean?

23:48.640 --> 23:50.279
She was an attractive young widow.

23:50.280 --> 23:51.359
Yes.

23:51.360 --> 23:52.639
And I was a married man!

23:52.640 --> 23:53.988
According to the file,

23:53.989 --> 23:56.039
there were rumours you two
were conducting an affair.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.759
Yeah, but that's what they were, rumours.

23:57.760 --> 23:59.851
Just gossip, drummed up by
a bunch of people

23:59.852 --> 24:01.457
no better than they should've been.

24:01.458 --> 24:03.659
Regardless, I'm sure you can see
how your intimacy

24:03.660 --> 24:04.959
could've put Anne-Marie in jeopardy.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.960
That's not what happened!

24:11.560 --> 24:14.679
Did she meet a police
officer to pass information

24:14.680 --> 24:19.300
on the evening of
Tuesday the 18th April 1989?

24:21.360 --> 24:22.839
Yes.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.039
You?

24:24.040 --> 24:25.080
Yes.

24:26.160 --> 24:27.519
What happened that night?

24:27.520 --> 24:29.829
Well, she told me that
she'd made up some story

24:29.830 --> 24:31.879
about going to visit a sick friend.

24:31.880 --> 24:33.559
She passed the information to me.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.199
And, as far as I know, she returned home.

24:35.200 --> 24:36.959
Were you involved in her disappearance?

24:36.960 --> 24:38.080
No.

24:39.760 --> 24:42.959
As God is my witness, I was not.

24:42.960 --> 24:44.799
According to the Missing Persons file,

24:44.800 --> 24:46.559
you were the last person
to see her alive.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.999
That is an equivocation,
Detective Chief Superintendent,

24:50.000 --> 24:51.759
as well you know.

24:51.760 --> 24:53.460
I'll rephrase.

24:54.160 --> 24:57.679
You were the last person to admit
to police in an official statement

24:57.680 --> 24:59.719
to seeing Anne-Marie McGillis alive.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.319
I watched her walk down
the street, turn the corner.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.999
Anne-Marie McGillis
trusted you implicitly?

25:06.000 --> 25:07.319
Yes, I believe she did.

25:07.320 --> 25:10.079
One theory considered by the RUC
is that you exploited that trust

25:10.080 --> 25:12.367
- to lure Anne-Marie to her death.
- Completely false!

25:12.368 --> 25:13.759
The theory being that, as a Catholic,

25:13.760 --> 25:15.519
you were susceptible to
relationships with

25:15.520 --> 25:17.707
the very organisations that
Anne-Marie was informing on.

25:17.708 --> 25:20.359
Look Growing up back then,
in the 70's, in the city,

25:20.360 --> 25:22.319
they were everywhere.
They were part of the culture.

25:22.320 --> 25:24.479
This sort of organisation?

25:24.480 --> 25:26.679
Oh, come on now, I didn't want
any part of that.

25:26.680 --> 25:27.999
I became a police officer.

25:28.000 --> 25:29.839
Anything familiar about their appearance?

25:29.840 --> 25:31.999
It was a different time,
a different thing entirely.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.269
Nonetheless, they're wearing
the clothing associated with

25:34.270 --> 25:36.879
organised crime groups
that AC12 have been investigating

25:36.880 --> 25:39.399
- for seven years or more.
- There's no direct connection!

25:39.400 --> 25:42.439
Anne-Marie McGillis' remains
weren't found until 2001.

25:42.440 --> 25:44.519
Document 72.

25:44.520 --> 25:48.999
Document 72 is the postmortem report
on Anne-Marie McGillis.

25:49.000 --> 25:52.199
The cause of death was
a single gunshot wound to the head.

25:52.200 --> 25:54.439
Additional gunshot wounds were detected

25:54.440 --> 25:57.759
bilaterally on the victim's wrists,
knees and ankles.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.999
Lesions caused by haemorrhage
indicate these gunshot wounds

26:01.000 --> 26:03.239
were inflicted when the victim
was still alive.

26:03.240 --> 26:06.634
Anne-Marie McGillis was tortured
in the same pattern

26:06.635 --> 26:08.079
as that inflicted on your wife.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.999
Yeah, but that's how
they did it back then.

26:10.000 --> 26:13.279
But this does not necessitate
a direct connection.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.679
Her son. Did you ever meet him?

26:15.680 --> 26:16.940
Er...

26:17.720 --> 26:21.479
No. She always left her son with
some neighbours or a family friend,

26:21.480 --> 26:23.999
something like that.
She never wanted him involved.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.599
When Anne-Marie disappeared,

26:25.600 --> 26:27.439
her son was orphaned at the age of 10.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.479
He was taken in by Anne-Marie's sister

26:29.480 --> 26:31.599
and her brother-in-law,
who resided in Liverpool.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.100
The boy was adopted
and he took their surname.

26:36.940 --> 26:38.319
Corbett.

26:38.320 --> 26:39.980
John Corbett.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.040
Corbett was Anne-Marie's wee fella?

27:07.087 --> 27:08.287
No.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.919
Would you like to take a break, Ted?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.120
Yes, of course.

27:15.240 --> 27:16.500
OK.

27:23.680 --> 27:25.239
Is there anything I can do to help?

27:25.240 --> 27:26.720
Just give me a minute.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.159
Mark Moffatt? DI Fleming.

27:58.160 --> 28:00.679
DS Arnott. Do you have a minute, sir?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.079
Sir's long gone.

28:02.080 --> 28:03.479
Mark's fine.

28:03.480 --> 28:05.919
I don't know if you remember us
from AC12.

28:05.920 --> 28:08.199
- Can you give us a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

28:08.200 --> 28:10.519
Water under the bridge,
as far as I'm concerned.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.879
No hard feelings.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.679
We'd like to ask you
a couple of questions

28:13.680 --> 28:16.700
about your commercial relationship
with Superintendent Hastings.

28:21.040 --> 28:22.319
Ted was a...

28:22.320 --> 28:25.039
...an original investor in
a development that went south

28:25.040 --> 28:26.759
about six years back.

28:26.760 --> 28:30.599
We got it back on track,
so I offered Ted a buy-in

28:30.600 --> 28:32.799
to try and recoup his original losses.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.399
And did he?

28:34.400 --> 28:37.039
Unfortunately, he couldn't come up
with the funds.

28:37.040 --> 28:39.279
According to Superintendent Hastings,

28:39.280 --> 28:42.959
you loaned him £50,000 off-book.

28:42.960 --> 28:44.679
50?

28:44.680 --> 28:47.039
Yeah, that's the figure we've been given.

28:47.040 --> 28:49.820
I don't know how Ted's got that idea.

28:50.440 --> 28:53.439
Does the name John Corbett
mean anything to you?

28:53.720 --> 28:55.160
No, sorry.

28:57.106 --> 28:58.186
If that's all...

28:59.240 --> 29:00.759
Thanks for your time.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.100
Give Ted my best.

29:06.720 --> 29:08.959
Well, we drew a blank on Corbett.

29:08.960 --> 29:11.479
Yeah, you saw his reaction
when we mentioned the 50 grand.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.039
Something's not right.

29:13.040 --> 29:14.700
We need to find out what.

29:27.640 --> 29:30.399
Resuming interview.
You remain under caution.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.839
Now, let's examine in more detail

29:31.840 --> 29:35.439
some evidence we found in your
hotel room on the 14th of March.

29:35.440 --> 29:36.680
Image 9.

29:38.600 --> 29:42.879
You'll recall Image 9
shows item reference MB1.

29:42.880 --> 29:45.399
You'll recall item reference MB1
is a brown envelope

29:45.400 --> 29:48.759
addressed to you,
containing item reference MB2.

29:48.760 --> 29:52.839
MB2 are banknotes in the sum of £50,000.

29:52.840 --> 29:57.391
Superintendent Hastings has already
given a full and clear explanation

29:57.392 --> 29:59.839
regarding this item. To summarise,

29:59.840 --> 30:03.279
it was an unsolicited advance
on future profits.

30:03.280 --> 30:06.087
Superintendent Hastings
was extremely uncomfortable

30:06.088 --> 30:08.559
about the loan, and telephoned
Mark Moffat to return the money.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.119
DI Brandyce.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.759
We took further steps to detect
the source of said cash.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.919
I told you, it came from Mark Moffatt.

30:14.920 --> 30:16.220
DI Brandyce.

30:17.560 --> 30:20.119
Document 40 in your folders.

30:20.120 --> 30:22.488
Forensic analysis of banknotes MB2

30:22.489 --> 30:25.479
detected microscopic pollen deposits.

30:25.480 --> 30:29.079
Pollen grains detected on MB2 were
subjected to chemical analysis.

30:29.080 --> 30:31.799
The chemical structure of pollen
grains detected on MB2

30:31.800 --> 30:34.799
closely resembles the chemical
structure of pollen grains

30:34.800 --> 30:37.479
detected on items of evidence gathered

30:37.480 --> 30:40.759
during AC-12's inquiry
into Operation Pear Tree.

30:40.760 --> 30:47.079
Said evidence are item reference
JLM5 and item reference JD5.

30:47.080 --> 30:48.780
Image 12, Tina.

30:49.960 --> 30:55.213
Image 12 shows a cache of banknotes
in the sum of £25,000

30:55.214 --> 30:58.679
detected under floorboards
at 21 Cleric Way.

30:58.680 --> 31:01.119
Do you recognise the banknotes
shown in the image,

31:01.120 --> 31:03.279
- Superintendent Hastings?
- No, no, I do not.

31:03.280 --> 31:05.199
Said banknotes were detected
at a property

31:05.200 --> 31:07.359
belonging to a Vihaan Malhotra.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.279
Image 31.

31:09.280 --> 31:12.719
Image 31 shows item reference JD5.

31:12.720 --> 31:16.430
JD5 is a cache of banknotes
in the sum of £5,000

31:16.431 --> 31:19.279
detected at 17 Hazelton Street.

31:19.280 --> 31:21.359
Said banknotes were detected
at a property

31:21.360 --> 31:23.679
belonging to PS Jane Cafferty.

31:23.680 --> 31:28.679
The similar pollen structures
detected on items JD5, JLM5

31:28.680 --> 31:32.799
and MB2 indicate a 99.5%
probability the items

31:32.800 --> 31:35.199
derive from the same original source.

31:35.200 --> 31:36.879
I have not been bribed!

31:36.880 --> 31:38.759
The 50 grand found in your hotel room

31:38.760 --> 31:41.559
came from the same pot as that
used to bribe Vihaan Malhotra

31:41.560 --> 31:43.239
and PS Jane Cafferty.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.359
And, according to evidence
obtained by your own unit,

31:46.360 --> 31:49.843
those individuals were in the pay
of the same organised crime group

31:49.844 --> 31:51.679
in which John Corbett was embedded.

31:51.680 --> 31:54.999
I do not have a connection
with Malhotra or Cafferty.

31:55.000 --> 31:56.999
- This bribe proves you do.
- No.

31:57.000 --> 32:00.639
Was it an inducement or
a reward for telling Lee Banks

32:00.640 --> 32:03.559
the identity of the undercover
officer within the OCG?

32:03.560 --> 32:04.999
I disclosed nothing to Banks.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.559
A disclosure which brought
about the murder of John Corbett.

32:07.560 --> 32:08.879
No.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.640
What was Corbett on to that you were
so desperate to keep hidden?

32:14.213 --> 32:15.573
I'll repeat the question.

32:16.520 --> 32:19.679
What was John Corbett on to that you
were so desperate to keep hidden?

32:19.680 --> 32:20.720
Look...

32:22.640 --> 32:25.719
...you have fabricated a motive
where none existed.

32:25.720 --> 32:27.740
Who would want John Corbett dead?

32:29.380 --> 32:31.439
- What do you mean?
- If you didn't, who would?

32:31.440 --> 32:32.719
Well, clearly any individual

32:32.720 --> 32:35.079
against whom John Corbett
might be gathering evidence,

32:35.080 --> 32:37.946
including those members of the OCG
with whom he was embedded.

32:37.947 --> 32:40.039
Were there any specific
corrupt police officers

32:40.040 --> 32:41.519
targeted by Operation Pear Tree?

32:41.520 --> 32:44.519
- Not that I'm aware of.
- Mm.

32:45.240 --> 32:48.039
Document 5 in your folders.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.894
This is a copy of a document
seized by AC-12 on the...

32:50.919 --> 32:56.319
...23rd of February from the offices
of Operation Pear Tree.

32:56.320 --> 33:01.380
I direct you to page 6, paragraph 6.

33:02.440 --> 33:03.919
"It remains to be determined

33:03.920 --> 33:06.719

"are actively complicit

33:11.640 --> 33:14.399

"of senior or executive rank."

33:20.880 --> 33:23.799
- Do you recognise those words?
- Yes. Yes. I've read the file.

33:23.800 --> 33:26.263
There's a hell of a lot of
ifs and buts in that.

33:44.880 --> 33:47.400
Caddy. No, you're The Caddy.
We know that.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.679
- Told...
- Told!

34:03.000 --> 34:04.640
Come in, he can't talk.

34:05.760 --> 34:08.319

34:30.600 --> 34:32.300
Thank you, Tina.

on the 5th of May 2017.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.239
"However, the hypothesis must be
examined that H is

34:59.240 --> 35:01.959
"an officer other than Hilton."
Do you recall these words?

35:01.960 --> 35:04.239
Well, the evidence against Hilton
was overwhelming.

35:04.240 --> 35:06.759
Clearly, if any new evidence
came to light,

35:06.760 --> 35:08.959
AC-12 would gladly investigate.

35:08.960 --> 35:11.660
Has any other officer
ever been accused of being H?

35:14.600 --> 35:16.119
I'll repeat the question.

35:16.120 --> 35:19.439
Has any other senior officer
ever been accused of being H?

35:19.440 --> 35:21.360
- Yes.
- Who?

35:23.200 --> 35:25.239
The accusation was a calculated falsehood

35:25.240 --> 35:29.079
designed to sabotage a lawful
anticorruption inquiry.

35:29.080 --> 35:30.919
Who was accused?

35:30.920 --> 35:34.005
In an effort to sabotage an AC-12 inquiry

35:34.006 --> 35:35.839
that was about to uncover
his own offences,

35:35.840 --> 35:39.519
Assistant Chief Constable
Derek Hilton falsely accused

35:39.520 --> 35:44.655
the Senior Investigating Officer,
in order to discredit AC-12,

35:44.656 --> 35:48.359
discredit the inquiry,
and to protect his own wrongdoing.

35:48.360 --> 35:50.420
The SIO being who?

35:53.040 --> 35:54.559
Myself.

35:54.560 --> 35:57.399
To be clear, you were served with
a Regulation 15 Notice.

35:57.400 --> 36:01.679
The allegation against Superintendent
Hastings was disproved.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.079
It wasn't disproved.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.399
There was insufficient evidence
to prove it.

36:05.400 --> 36:08.319
- I'd argue they're the same thing.
- They're not. They're really not.

36:08.320 --> 36:11.639
Detective Chief Superintendent,
better to save the commentary

36:11.640 --> 36:13.620
and stick to asking questions.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.559
Just saying.

36:17.560 --> 36:19.210
Actually, while I've got your attention,

36:19.211 --> 36:22.551
I wonder if we can dig into this search

36:22.552 --> 36:24.919
of Superintendent Hastings' hotel room.

36:24.920 --> 36:26.919
- This has all been covered.
- Not by me.

36:26.920 --> 36:29.839
What were the grounds for the search?

36:29.840 --> 36:31.360
Section 18.5.

36:33.840 --> 36:38.693
Well, why then does
Document 12 in your folders,

36:38.694 --> 36:42.254
the arresting officer's report,
refer to Section 32

36:42.255 --> 36:44.799
as the legal power
used to carry out the search?

36:44.800 --> 36:46.340
DI Brandyce?

36:47.920 --> 36:50.199
The correct search form was supplied.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.719
Afterwards, yes, but initially it seems

36:52.720 --> 36:56.239
that the officers at the scene of
Superintendent Hastings' arrest

36:56.240 --> 36:57.759
were under the impression

36:57.760 --> 37:00.919
that the search was being
carried out under Section 32.

37:00.920 --> 37:02.329
You were there at that time,

37:02.354 --> 37:03.799
- weren't you?
- Yes.

37:03.800 --> 37:09.220
So, under what power did you
carry out the search at the time?

37:11.080 --> 37:13.100
There was some confusion.

37:13.560 --> 37:16.020
I see that, DI Brandyce.

37:17.440 --> 37:21.319
You carried out the search
under Section 32.

37:21.320 --> 37:24.039
There's even the original
search form in the file.

37:24.040 --> 37:25.120
Thank you.

37:26.600 --> 37:27.959
As we all know,

37:27.960 --> 37:30.639
Section 32 permits the search
of a premises

37:30.640 --> 37:33.479
the detainee was at
either at the time of his arrest

37:33.480 --> 37:35.599
or immediately prior to that arrest.

37:35.600 --> 37:39.930
I refer to Document 13
in your folders, the statement

37:39.931 --> 37:43.439
given by Superintendent Hastings
on the 14th of March.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.559
Superintendent Hastings states
that he travelled from this office,

37:47.560 --> 37:51.439
Anticorruption Unit 12,
to the Edge Park Hotel.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.839
Superintendent Hastings
wasn't in his hotel room

37:53.840 --> 37:57.159
at the time of his arrest
or immediately prior.

37:57.160 --> 38:00.999
Section 32 was the incorrect legal power.

38:01.000 --> 38:04.959
This mistake was detected
and corrected only after the search.

38:04.960 --> 38:10.079
As items MB1 and MB2 submitted in
evidence were detected unlawfully,

38:10.080 --> 38:12.940
I can't see how the cache of £50,000

38:12.941 --> 38:16.039
can be used in evidence
against Superintendent Hastings.

38:16.040 --> 38:17.919
Well, that is for a court to decide.

38:17.920 --> 38:22.519
Given what I've heard, the judge
will almost certainly exclude it.

38:22.520 --> 38:24.359
And it's the only evidence
that you've got

38:24.360 --> 38:28.220
linking Superintendent Hastings
to organised crime.

38:41.680 --> 38:43.069
I think we should call a temporary halt,

38:43.070 --> 38:45.919
giving my team time
to examine further evidence.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.439
Mr Hastings,
you'll be returned to custody

38:48.440 --> 38:51.279
and charged or released within
24 hours of your original arrest.

38:51.280 --> 38:53.839
Approximately six hours.

38:53.840 --> 38:55.580
Interview terminated.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.480
- May I?
- Yes, yes, of course.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.999
Gill, I don't know what to say.

39:14.000 --> 39:15.359
I am not going to lie, Ted,

39:15.360 --> 39:17.839
it is a good job that someone
was paying attention.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.096
God knows where your solicitor
was during all that.

39:20.097 --> 39:22.239
Everything is in here in black and white.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.599
I know, I don't know why
I didn't see it myself.

39:24.600 --> 39:28.119
The idea that you are corrupt
is ridiculous.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.039
Clearly Mark Moffatt's
lying about the money.

39:31.040 --> 39:33.500
You don't have a bent bone in your body.

39:34.600 --> 39:36.879
This'll all go away, Ted.

39:36.880 --> 39:37.920
Trust me.

39:39.480 --> 39:41.404
Thanks, Gill. Thank you.

39:41.429 --> 39:42.980
- Yeah.,
- Yeah.

39:51.600 --> 39:54.840
DI Fleming, DS Arnott to see DSU Powell.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.500
It's fine. I've got this.

40:01.920 --> 40:03.640
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.319
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell

40:12.320 --> 40:14.839
with DI Fleming, DS Arnott, AC-12.

40:14.840 --> 40:17.839
Confirm that you grant permission
for this recording.

40:17.840 --> 40:20.959
- DI Fleming, confirmed.
- DS Arnott, confirmed.

40:20.960 --> 40:24.279
We'd like to fill in some background
on how John Corbett was recruited.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.639
How was Corbett assigned as the UCO?

40:26.640 --> 40:29.839
John was one of a number of
candidates considered for the role.

40:29.840 --> 40:32.319
He presented with a distinguished record

40:32.320 --> 40:35.639
of successful operations
against organised crime.

40:35.640 --> 40:38.999
Did he come to you first, ma'am?
Did he volunteer?

40:39.420 --> 40:41.240
What are you getting at, DI Fleming?

40:42.640 --> 40:44.300
It's a straight question, ma'am.

40:44.880 --> 40:48.359
There was a short list.
The candidates were evaluated.

40:48.360 --> 40:50.759
Corbett was selected as
the right officer for the job.

40:50.760 --> 40:52.260
Who selected him?

40:56.920 --> 40:58.060
Look,

40:58.560 --> 41:02.799
I made the recommendations
on Corbett, this was my operation,

41:02.800 --> 41:06.560
but you can't put all of this on me,
I wasn't the only person involved.

41:07.600 --> 41:10.160
Who else was involved
in selecting Corbett?

41:18.920 --> 41:20.800
This is off the record.

41:24.600 --> 41:26.919
How long have we got?

41:26.920 --> 41:29.079
Just a few hours.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.980
Going to have to blue-light it.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.319
We just got the e-mail.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.184
I'm calling for authentication. Thanks.

41:39.185 --> 41:42.119
Edward Hastings, new evidence
against you has come to light.

41:42.120 --> 41:44.559
This evidence will be submitted
in written form

41:44.560 --> 41:46.759
and you and your solicitor
will have four hours

41:46.760 --> 41:48.319
to consider this evidence.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.559
- What new evidence?
- Great, thanks.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.119
Pending further investigation,

41:52.120 --> 41:54.199
I'll be seeking an extension of 12 hours

41:54.200 --> 41:55.759
to your permitted custody time.

41:55.760 --> 41:58.439
- What evidence?
- Take him to the cells.

41:58.440 --> 42:00.420
Come on, Ted, we should do as they say.

42:11.280 --> 42:12.880
- Thank you, Tina.
- Ma'am.

42:14.080 --> 42:15.820
Looks like we've got him, ma'am.

42:17.440 --> 42:19.320
You nearly cost me this case.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.679
I'll be expecting your transfer request

42:22.680 --> 42:24.000
first thing in the morning.

43:06.520 --> 43:07.959
Mrs Corbett.

43:07.960 --> 43:10.519
We've got a new line of inquiry,
we need your urgent help with it.

43:10.520 --> 43:12.159
May we come in please?

43:12.160 --> 43:14.320
- Yeah, come in.
- Thanks.

43:55.920 --> 43:59.960
Subject is in the building. Repeat,
the subject is in the building.

44:07.000 --> 44:09.120
This must be awful for you, Ted.

44:27.800 --> 44:29.919
Resuming interview of Edward Hastings.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.119
You remain under caution.

44:31.120 --> 44:33.799
Have you had an opportunity
to consider with your solicitor

44:33.800 --> 44:35.640
the new documents disclosed to you?

44:36.720 --> 44:37.759
I have.

44:38.660 --> 44:39.992
Edward Hastings,

44:39.993 --> 44:42.159
when was the last time you were
in contact with John Corbett?

44:42.160 --> 44:43.679
Never.

44:43.680 --> 44:45.399
And have you ever been near enough

44:45.400 --> 44:48.479
to make physical contact
with John Corbett?

44:48.800 --> 44:50.080
Never.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.759
I'll ask you again.

44:52.760 --> 44:55.239
When were you last in physical
contact with John Corbett?

44:55.240 --> 44:56.999
I only ever saw the fella once.

44:57.000 --> 44:58.976
It was across a very busy street

44:58.977 --> 45:02.719
during an AC-12 surveillance operation.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.439
It must have been 100 yards away.

45:04.440 --> 45:06.602
As you'll have seen
in the disclosure documents,

45:06.603 --> 45:08.879
specifically Document 106
in your folders,

45:08.880 --> 45:11.199
forensic examination
of John Corbett's body

45:11.200 --> 45:13.879
has detected human hairs
not belonging to him.

45:13.880 --> 45:16.079
Said hairs were attached
to follicular cells

45:16.080 --> 45:18.119
which permitted DNA analysis.

45:18.120 --> 45:20.159
The DNA found in these follicular cells

45:20.160 --> 45:22.639
matches that of a person
on the police database

45:22.640 --> 45:26.039
who is a police officer
who has submitted a DNA sample

45:26.040 --> 45:29.879
for routine elimination
from crime scene contamination.

45:29.880 --> 45:32.159
As you know from the documents
disclosed to you,

45:32.160 --> 45:34.999
the DNA deposits detected
on John Corbett's body

45:35.000 --> 45:37.479
match your elimination samples.

45:37.480 --> 45:40.799
I've never been within
100 yards of John Corbett.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.359
Your DNA was found on his body.

45:42.360 --> 45:43.919
Can you explain this finding?

45:43.920 --> 45:46.599
I can't! It must have been planted!

45:46.600 --> 45:49.159
As a result of this evidence,
I have been in consultation

45:49.160 --> 45:51.559
with the Senior Prosecutor
in the Complex Case Unit.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.799
I did not kill Corbett!

45:52.800 --> 45:54.679
She is satisfied that
the evidence against you

45:54.680 --> 45:57.119
is sufficient to charge you
with the murder of John Corbett.

45:57.120 --> 45:58.639
No, I'm being framed!

45:58.640 --> 46:00.897
I'd now like to move on
to examine your motive

46:00.898 --> 46:02.305
for murdering John Corbett.

46:02.333 --> 46:04.055
I did not murder Corbett!

46:04.080 --> 46:06.559
May I ask, given the gravity of
the murder charge,

46:06.560 --> 46:08.039
why are you continuing?

46:08.040 --> 46:10.383
I have been tasked with investigating

46:10.384 --> 46:11.945
the highest level of corruption

46:11.946 --> 46:13.559
between police officers
and organised crime,

46:13.560 --> 46:16.279
- the highest level.
- I am not corrupt!

46:16.280 --> 46:19.679
I'm the one who's leading
the fight against corruption!

46:19.680 --> 46:24.820
The highest level is
the individual codenamed H.

46:26.640 --> 46:29.429
Significantly, Cottan led AC-12's inquiry

46:29.430 --> 46:31.279
into the identity of the police officer

46:31.280 --> 46:34.279
believed to be the intermediary
for organised crime,

46:34.280 --> 46:35.719
codenamed The Caddy.

46:35.720 --> 46:38.119
The Caddy was identified
as being Cottan himself.

46:38.120 --> 46:41.559
Superintendent Hastings was
the Senior Investigating Officer

46:41.560 --> 46:43.920
on the inquiry into H.

46:45.520 --> 46:48.039
I see an interesting parallel there.

46:48.040 --> 46:51.359
No, no. There's no parallel there.
I'm not H.

46:51.360 --> 46:53.839
Still, there was
an allegation that you were.

46:53.840 --> 46:56.041
Why were you so reluctant to entrust
the investigation

46:56.042 --> 46:57.768
into an independent anticorruption unit?

46:57.793 --> 46:58.879
I wasn't.

46:58.880 --> 47:01.100
Why did you shoot Robert Denmoor?

47:02.600 --> 47:06.731
Image 76 on screen.
Image 76 shows Robert Denmoor,

47:06.732 --> 47:09.959
a violent criminal with known
associations to organised crime.

47:09.960 --> 47:11.599
Denmoor was incriminated in a plot

47:11.600 --> 47:13.959
to tamper with evidence
in Operation Trapdoor.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.439
Denmoor was shot
dead by Superintendent Hastings

47:16.440 --> 47:20.599
on the ground floor of AC-12's
headquarters on the 4th of May 2017.

47:20.600 --> 47:23.079
Yeah, Denmoor posed an immediate
threat to life

47:23.080 --> 47:25.839
and lethal force was required
to stop him.

47:25.840 --> 47:30.039
Therefore the Coroner recorded
a finding of lawful killing.

47:30.040 --> 47:33.679
The official report records there
were a dozen AFOs on the scene,

47:33.680 --> 47:35.159
and none of them opened fire.

47:35.160 --> 47:36.679
In fact, according to the report,

47:36.680 --> 47:39.219
you snatched a firearm
from a wounded AFO.

47:39.244 --> 47:40.311
Yeah, I did.

47:40.312 --> 47:43.079
The fatal round discharged by you
prevented questioning of Denmoor.

47:43.080 --> 47:45.199
Prevented the loss of life.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.879
Denmoor would have been a key witness

47:46.880 --> 47:49.159
who could have confirmed Hilton as H.

47:49.160 --> 47:50.879
- Yes.
- Or excluded him.

47:50.880 --> 47:52.319
Yes, also.

47:52.320 --> 47:54.439
You were prepared to lose
that priceless evidence,

47:54.440 --> 47:56.759
the same judgment you demonstrated
on the 12th of March

47:56.760 --> 48:00.399
when you ordered DS Arnott to deploy
lethal force against John Corbett.

48:00.400 --> 48:01.959
Look, I told you, Corbett was armed,

48:01.960 --> 48:04.519
he was responsible for the death
of Maneet Bindra,

48:04.520 --> 48:05.599
Lester Hargreaves,

48:05.600 --> 48:08.879
I gave the order to
safeguard my officer's life!

48:08.880 --> 48:11.547
Corbett was notifying DS Arnott
of a meeting

48:11.548 --> 48:14.159
with a high-ranking nominal
who could well have been H.

48:14.160 --> 48:16.719
Corbett was a liar.

48:16.720 --> 48:19.079
He was playing games with all of us.

48:19.080 --> 48:20.679
He was a decorated undercover officer

48:20.680 --> 48:23.039
whose courageous actions in the past
had brought to justice

48:23.040 --> 48:25.359
hardened members of
organised criminal groups.

48:25.360 --> 48:28.319
Corbett gave DS Arnott alone
the details of the meeting with H.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.359
He did.

48:29.360 --> 48:31.439
You ordered DS Arnott
to disclose those details?

48:31.440 --> 48:33.599
You're damn right I did,
I was his commanding officer,

48:33.600 --> 48:35.639
for Christ's sake.
What the hell's going on here?

48:35.640 --> 48:37.759
And at said meeting, the same day,
the 12th of March,

48:37.760 --> 48:39.835
at the Palisades Shopping Centre,
what happened then?

48:39.836 --> 48:42.519
- No meeting took place.
- Why do you think that was?

48:42.520 --> 48:45.959
Well, Corbett was about to be
apprehended by AC-12.

48:45.960 --> 48:48.759
I suspect that he, you know, lied
about the meeting at the Palisades

48:48.760 --> 48:50.239
to secure his own escape.

48:50.240 --> 48:53.260
Or he was telling the truth
and the information was leaked to H.

48:54.760 --> 48:57.660
We detected no evidence of a leak.

48:58.520 --> 49:01.439
We examined your personal
communications records

49:01.440 --> 49:02.999
and found no suspicious calls.

49:03.000 --> 49:07.199
However I do need you to account
for two unexplained findings.

49:07.200 --> 49:10.039
We've detected activity
in the vicinity of AC-12

49:10.040 --> 49:12.599
on unregistered mobile phones,

49:12.600 --> 49:16.319
so-called burner phones
used for illicit communications.

49:16.320 --> 49:19.799
We've identified a specific
burner phone. Tina, thank you.

49:19.800 --> 49:22.759
Document 92.
Document 92 is a call history

49:22.760 --> 49:28.162
of an unregistered mobile, 07700900856.

49:28.163 --> 49:29.799
The device shows clusters of activity

49:29.800 --> 49:32.839
in the vicinity of AC-12
over the last six weeks

49:32.840 --> 49:36.679
and also engaged in communication
with other burner phones.

49:36.680 --> 49:38.839
Cross checking with door entry
download data

49:38.840 --> 49:41.879
reveals only one AC-12 officer
was present in the building

49:41.880 --> 49:46.639
on every occasion 07700900856
was detected.

49:46.640 --> 49:49.479
That officer was
Superintendent Edward Hastings.

49:49.480 --> 49:54.534
Is 07700900856 your phone?

49:54.535 --> 49:55.759
No, it is not.

49:55.760 --> 49:58.279
- Did you dispose of the phone?
- There was never a phone.

49:58.280 --> 50:01.320
Have you ever disposed
of a communications device?

50:03.960 --> 50:06.079
- Tina.
- Document 24.

50:06.080 --> 50:09.466
Document 24 shows screenshots
from a laptop

50:09.467 --> 50:11.759
forensically recovered
from the Flicker nightclub

50:11.760 --> 50:15.279
used by Lisa McQueen and
John Corbett to communicate with H.

50:15.280 --> 50:19.279
As we can see,
H issued his orders via text.

50:19.280 --> 50:21.326
I'll repeat the question.
Have you ever disposed

50:21.327 --> 50:23.119
- of a communications device?
- No.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.719
- PS Tranter, thank you.
- As stated by DCS Carmichael,

50:25.720 --> 50:28.319
we examined the communication
history of Edward Hastings.

50:28.320 --> 50:31.799
Document 28 in your folders
is said communication history

50:31.800 --> 50:34.119
relating to your personal
registered mobile telephone

50:34.120 --> 50:36.919
and your work registered
mobile telephone.

50:36.920 --> 50:40.279
From these phones we've been able
to harvest location data.

50:40.280 --> 50:43.919
We detected suspicious behaviour
on the 5th of March.

50:43.920 --> 50:47.239
Location data places both phones
at the Edge Park Hotel

50:47.240 --> 50:49.639
around 15:00 hours that day.

50:49.640 --> 50:52.399
The user then switches off both
phones for the rest of the day.

50:52.400 --> 50:55.359
When location data resumes
the next day, the 6th of March,

50:55.360 --> 50:57.959
the phones are back
in the Edge Park Hotel.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.559
Why did you switch off your phones?

51:00.560 --> 51:03.479
I... I really don't recall.

51:03.480 --> 51:07.239
Do you recall the significance
of that date, the 5th of March?

51:07.240 --> 51:09.719
- No.
- That night,

51:09.720 --> 51:12.559
the OCG carried out an armed robbery
at the Eastfield Depot,

51:12.560 --> 51:14.079
making away with seized goods

51:14.080 --> 51:16.519
with an estimated street value
of £50 million.

51:16.520 --> 51:18.439
Yeah, OK, look, I'm sorry.

51:18.440 --> 51:20.999
I mean,
the date must have slipped my mind.

51:21.000 --> 51:24.279
Where were you from 15:00 hours
on the 5th of March?

51:24.280 --> 51:26.519
Well, I remained...

51:26.520 --> 51:29.799
I remained in and around
the Edge Park Hotel,

51:29.800 --> 51:33.919
on standby for developments
for AC-12's surveillance operation

51:33.920 --> 51:35.759
on the Eastfield Depot.

51:35.760 --> 51:39.279
This was a hugely important operation.

51:39.280 --> 51:42.479
Wasn't it essential
that you be contactable?

51:42.480 --> 51:44.959
Well, I... We'd established
a direct line of communication

51:44.960 --> 51:49.239
through Airwave radio and I had
direct dial access to my officers.

51:49.240 --> 51:51.639
My own works phone was redundant.

51:51.640 --> 51:53.940
Why didn't you attend
the operation in person?

51:54.560 --> 51:57.279
To ensure operational independence.

51:57.280 --> 52:02.159
DI Fleming, she acted as
the Tactical Firearms Commander

52:02.160 --> 52:05.159
under an independent
Strategic Firearms Commander.

52:05.160 --> 52:07.599
The result being that
your whereabouts were unknown

52:07.600 --> 52:10.479
until you made contact via an
Airwave radio much later that night.

52:10.480 --> 52:12.079
That's neither here nor there.

52:12.080 --> 52:15.119
We attempted to trace your movements
on the 5th of March.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.639
Tina, thank you.

52:16.640 --> 52:19.959
Starting from a radius of 100 metres
around the Edge Park Hotel,

52:19.960 --> 52:21.999
we examined CCTV and traffic cameras.

52:22.000 --> 52:23.479
Image 32.

52:23.480 --> 52:24.880
Who's seen in this image?

52:26.440 --> 52:27.519
Me.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.200
What's the package you're carrying?

52:31.400 --> 52:32.839
I'm reserving comment.

52:32.840 --> 52:34.519
We were able to trace the taxi's journey

52:34.520 --> 52:37.039
to a drop-off point
in the Moss Heath area.

52:37.040 --> 52:40.759
Again, we examined CCTV cameras
in a 100-metre radius.

52:40.760 --> 52:42.479
Image 33.

52:42.480 --> 52:44.100
Who's seen in this image?

52:45.000 --> 52:46.199
Me.

52:46.200 --> 52:48.060
What are you doing in this image?

52:56.120 --> 52:59.079
We know from the recovered laptop
from the nightclub

52:59.080 --> 53:02.839
that the OCG communicated with H
via online messaging.

53:02.840 --> 53:06.602
Examination of the OCG laptop's
hard drive

53:06.603 --> 53:12.185
revealed a sophisticated
re-routing system via various VPNs

53:12.186 --> 53:14.613
to disguise H's IP address.

53:14.614 --> 53:17.359
And while we're still unable
to determine H's location,

53:17.360 --> 53:20.119
we know for certain that
the hard drive of the computer

53:20.120 --> 53:22.879
would contain metadata
proving it was used

53:22.880 --> 53:24.759
to communicate with the OCG.

53:24.760 --> 53:29.620
Evidence that he would take
great pains to... dispose of.

53:46.160 --> 53:47.240
OK.

53:48.960 --> 53:52.140
Well, we shall come back to it.

53:54.080 --> 53:56.359
As we've established, the night
of the 5th of March

53:56.360 --> 53:59.440
saw the OCG robbery
at the Eastfield Depot.

53:59.441 --> 54:01.266
At 22:40 hours that night,

54:01.267 --> 54:04.256
a status zero radio call was
made by PC Kieran Bloom

54:04.257 --> 54:06.519
requesting urgent assistance
to Farmer's Lane.

54:06.520 --> 54:08.879
How did you respond
to that emergency call?

54:08.880 --> 54:11.759
The Authorised Firearms Officers
who were giving assistance

54:11.760 --> 54:14.319
to the AC-12 surveillance
of the Eastfield Depot

54:14.320 --> 54:17.359
were the nearest armed response unit.

54:17.360 --> 54:20.999
And so given our responsibility
towards preserving life,

54:21.000 --> 54:24.919
I authorised the AFOs
to render assistance.

54:24.920 --> 54:29.477
As a result of your actions,
the OCG were able to flee Eastfield

54:29.478 --> 54:32.479
with £50 million worth of seized goods.

54:32.480 --> 54:36.279
My decision was based on saving
police officers' lives.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.719
Priceless, I would say.

54:38.720 --> 54:41.759
H would have wanted the robbery
to succeed, wouldn't he,

54:41.760 --> 54:43.919
so that he could have
shared in the proceeds?

54:43.920 --> 54:45.680
That's hypothetical.

54:48.440 --> 54:51.599
You went to a nightclub
known to be an OCG haunt,

54:51.600 --> 54:55.919
in the hope of effecting a meeting,
without independent authorisation.

54:55.920 --> 54:59.119
Yeah, well, look...
You know, they'd killed Maneet,

54:59.120 --> 55:02.879
they'd murdered Lester Hargreaves,
they'd held up the Eastfield depot.

55:02.880 --> 55:05.679
- Time was running out.
- You pretended to be H

55:05.680 --> 55:08.119
successfully enough for the OCG
to share with you

55:08.120 --> 55:10.572
the proceeds of the Eastfield Robbery.

55:10.573 --> 55:13.599
No. I was using them to find out
where the proceeds were hidden.

55:13.600 --> 55:16.018
Who better to impersonate
H than H himself?

55:16.019 --> 55:19.690
No. That is not what was happening!
It's like I told you,

55:19.691 --> 55:21.719
look, time was running out.
I was desperate.

55:21.720 --> 55:23.999
Well, it's convenient
to rationalise all this

55:24.000 --> 55:26.239
as the desperation of a failing SIO.

55:26.240 --> 55:28.119
But before we do,

55:28.120 --> 55:31.919
let's consider the communications
made between Corbett and you

55:31.920 --> 55:33.519
via a computer link. Tina.

55:33.520 --> 55:35.959
Document 105 in your folders
and on screen.

55:35.960 --> 55:40.639
Document 105 is a transcript
of a written message composed by you

55:40.640 --> 55:43.760
and transmitted on the evening
of the 12th of March.

55:44.920 --> 55:46.879
Please look at line 3, which reads,

55:46.880 --> 55:48.879
"I can definately pull
the right strings."

55:48.880 --> 55:51.999
Note the misspelling of "definitely".

55:52.000 --> 55:55.239
Going back to earlier messages
believed to have been written by H,

55:55.240 --> 55:59.439
please look at the message
transmitted on the 3rd of March,

55:59.440 --> 56:03.639
"Eastfield Depot is definately high
risk." Again, note the misspelling.

56:03.640 --> 56:06.279
How closely had you studied
the messages by H?

56:06.280 --> 56:08.519
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Quite closely.

56:08.520 --> 56:11.679
Closely enough to duplicate the
misspelling of this particular word?

56:11.680 --> 56:13.359
Yes.

56:13.360 --> 56:17.097
You're the SIO on one of the biggest
anticorruption operations

56:17.098 --> 56:18.359
this force has ever seen,

56:18.360 --> 56:22.239
and you have the headspace
to learn to spell like H?

56:22.240 --> 56:23.719
Yes.

56:23.720 --> 56:26.639
Isn't it more likely that you
inadvertently misspelled this word?

56:26.640 --> 56:28.202
- No.
- No? Isn't it more likely

56:28.227 --> 56:29.799
that you made the same mistake as H

56:29.800 --> 56:32.700
- because you are H?
- I am not H.

56:35.720 --> 56:37.919
Looking at another part
of the impersonated message

56:37.920 --> 56:41.119
you composed, line 4, "I need you
to bring all this to a close."

56:41.120 --> 56:42.679
What did you mean by that?

56:42.680 --> 56:45.759
What H meant was that
the Eastfield goods were a liability

56:45.760 --> 56:47.839
and needed to be taken
out of the country quickly.

56:47.840 --> 56:49.199
It could imply another meaning,

56:49.200 --> 56:51.399
that you were giving the order
to execute John Corbett.

56:51.400 --> 56:53.519
No! Absolutely not!

56:53.520 --> 56:55.999
What private material was stored
on the hard drive

56:56.000 --> 56:58.919
of the laptop computer that
you erased on the 5th of March?

56:58.920 --> 57:00.919
No, it's not relevant to this inquiry.

57:00.920 --> 57:02.719
If we'd been able to find H's computer,

57:02.720 --> 57:03.999
we'd have the proof we needed.

57:04.000 --> 57:06.279
You disposed of your computer
because you knew that.

57:06.280 --> 57:09.228
That it would prove beyond all
reasonable doubt that you are H.

57:09.229 --> 57:10.176
No.

57:10.201 --> 57:12.540
Then why did you dispose of the computer?

57:19.080 --> 57:21.340
I was looking at pornography.

57:21.920 --> 57:24.159
Nothing illegal, nothing extreme.

57:24.160 --> 57:27.919
I just did not want it to be found.

57:27.920 --> 57:29.359
That's all.

57:29.360 --> 57:30.999
Nothing illegal or extreme,

57:31.000 --> 57:33.319
but you went to the lengths
of disposing of the computer?

57:33.320 --> 57:36.239
Look, it was private stuff,
so, you know...

57:36.240 --> 57:38.839
My wife has left me, and...

57:38.840 --> 57:40.086
Jesus Christ.

57:40.087 --> 57:42.559
Look, I really don't want to discuss it.

57:42.560 --> 57:46.159
And after you entered the nightclub
as part of your...

57:46.160 --> 57:49.181
...unauthorised undercover operation,

57:49.182 --> 57:51.759
you were next located where
the Eastfield goods

57:51.760 --> 57:53.239
were being concealed.

57:53.240 --> 57:55.199
It was pure chance,
an active burner phone

57:55.200 --> 57:57.159
inadvertently left on by an OCG member,

57:57.160 --> 57:58.279
that meant you were found.

57:58.280 --> 58:01.079
We could be forgiven for thinking
that you didn't want to be found.

58:01.080 --> 58:02.719
No, that's simply not true.

58:02.720 --> 58:05.679
The net was closing in. Your
identity was slowly being unmasked.

58:05.680 --> 58:09.699
You reunited with the OCG
in order to share in the profits

58:09.700 --> 58:11.718
of the Eastfield robbery.

58:11.719 --> 58:13.320
Look, no... Look, look...

58:14.640 --> 58:19.239
I had risked my life and my career
in order to catch them.

58:19.240 --> 58:22.239
The two most precious things
to me in the whole world,

58:22.240 --> 58:24.599
I laid them on the line,

58:24.600 --> 58:27.239
because I was so determined,

58:27.639 --> 58:31.399
and I was so desperate
that AC-12 would not fail.

58:33.160 --> 58:35.159
Do you know, one thing
I keep going back to

58:35.160 --> 58:39.007
is that dying declaration
by DI Cottan. Tina, thank you.

58:39.008 --> 58:41.599
Cottan, your own officer,
named the top man as H.

58:41.600 --> 58:45.439
And now, finally, there's
overwhelming evidence that H is you.

58:45.440 --> 58:47.159
I'm not H.

58:47.160 --> 58:48.429
John Corbett was proving

58:48.454 --> 58:49.914
- the trail led to your door.
- No.

58:49.915 --> 58:51.000
That's why you had John Corbett

58:51.025 --> 58:52.079
- murdered.
- No.

58:52.080 --> 58:54.181
You ordered DS Arnott to shoot him dead.

58:54.182 --> 58:55.759
- No.
- And when that plan failed,

58:55.760 --> 58:57.559
you visited Lee Banks
in Blackthorn Prison

58:57.560 --> 59:00.359
and revealed to him that Corbett
was an undercover police officer.

59:00.360 --> 59:03.039
- No. No.
- But killing Corbett wasn't enough.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.519
You needed to know what
he had on you, didn't you?

59:05.520 --> 59:06.835
- No.
- And that was the biggest mistake

59:06.860 --> 59:08.039
that you made.

59:08.040 --> 59:10.759
Because in the final meeting
with Corbett,

59:10.760 --> 59:12.359
before you slashed his throat

59:12.360 --> 59:14.319
and dumped him at the breakers yard,

59:14.320 --> 59:17.038
one of your hairs
contaminated Corbett's body.

59:17.039 --> 59:18.220
NO!

59:19.720 --> 59:22.639
Edward Hastings, H,

59:22.640 --> 59:25.239
I have been in consultation with
the Senior Prosecutor

59:25.240 --> 59:28.279
at the Complex Case Unit and
I will now go back to her

59:28.280 --> 59:31.519
seeking authority to charge you
with the murder of John Corbett,

59:31.520 --> 59:35.679
conspiracy to commit armed robbery
and malfeasance in a public office.

59:35.680 --> 59:37.319
I think it might be helpful

59:37.320 --> 59:40.359
if Mr Hastings is given some time
with his solicitor.

59:40.360 --> 59:41.600
Fine by me.

59:42.920 --> 59:44.679
Thank you, Tina, well done.

59:44.680 --> 59:45.960
Ma'am.

59:51.600 --> 59:54.360
Interview terminated at 21:46.

01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.720
Where's the AFOs?

01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:05.959
Kyle?

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.399
Ma'am.

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:08.867
I thought there was meant to be
armed support

01:00:08.868 --> 01:00:11.119
while the gaffer was being interviewed?

01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:13.199
Looks like it's been scaled back.

01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:15.559
It'll be down to other
operational commitments.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.220
- Always is.
- OK.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.879
You've got to hand it to Carmichael.

01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:30.679
There's a lot stacking up.

01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.867
And that's with setting aside

01:00:32.868 --> 01:00:34.919
the bundle of cash in your hotel room.

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:37.560
- Which I was about to return!
- All of it?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.911
Moffatt denies any knowledge of the money

01:00:41.912 --> 01:00:44.239
so nobody's put the exact sum to him.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.479
But according to the files,
the amount required to buy in

01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:50.260
to the property development
wasn't 50 grand...

01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.839
...it was 100.

01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:57.540
Now, if there is another
50 grand somewhere...

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:00.740
...eventually someone's going to find it.

01:01:01.120 --> 01:01:02.759
Now, I'm on your side, Ted.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.799
But if I was on a jury,

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.559
I'd say this all looks damning.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.519
Now, I'm confident I can talk
the PCC into

01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.559
applying political pressure to
suppress Carmichael's investigation.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.679
Much better to blow our trumpets
about recovering the stolen goods

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.820
and neutralising the OCG.

01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.799
You'll have to accept a misconduct charge

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.759
for carrying out unauthorised operations

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:27.119
and resign from the force.

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:29.460
No doubt AC-12 will be disbanded.

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:38.679
Thank you, yes, the threshold tests
have been met definitely.

01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.119
What's going on?

01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:42.320
The DCS is on to the Crown Prosecutor.

01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:45.520
- Ma'am.
- Ma'am.

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:51.520
- DS Arnott.
- DI Fleming.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.159
Well, the last thing I need right
now is another knife in me back.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.119
That was never our intention, sir.

01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:03.580
Yeah? Funny way of showing it.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.039
We've been making inquiries
into some of the gaps

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.119
in our understanding of Corbett's
involvement in Operation Pear Tree.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.559
Yeah. Under whose orders? Hers?

01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:14.599
No, sir, on our own.

01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:16.340
We're just trying to find the truth.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:19.399
What's going on?

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.531
We've gathered further information
that may be relevant

01:02:21.532 --> 01:02:24.039
- to your inquiry.
- You can brief me in private.

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:26.559
If it's OK with you, ma'am,
we intend to share our findings

01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:29.719
with Superintendent Hastings
and his solicitor.

01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.999
His solicitor is making calls.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.239
Yeah, well, they've come to talk to me

01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.119
and I'd like to hear what
they've got to say.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:39.340
Quite right. It's up to you
if you want to be in on it or not.

01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.799
Operation Pear Tree
was originally authorised

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.439
following an instruction
from Rohan Sindwhani,

01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.279
the Police and Crime Commissioner.

01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:52.639
Sindwhani had made an election
promise to tackle police corruption.

01:02:52.640 --> 01:02:56.319
The specific remit of Pear Tree
is to examine whether complicity

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.999
between organised crime
and police officers

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.479
has been institutionalised in this force.

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:03.279
Detective Superintendent Alison Powell,

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.159
having no connection to Central Police,

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:06.839
was brought in to lead Pear Tree.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.039
Powell identified suitable
undercover officers

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.119
from outside forces

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.439
and submitted their CVs to
Deputy Chief Constable Andrea Wise.

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:15.159
Following a consultation process,

01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.319
John Corbett was selected to be the UCO.

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:20.519
Bear in mind, Corbett's background
was available to be examined

01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.879
as part of the process.

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:25.719
This was before his service record
was erased from the database

01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:28.479
and large portions of the Pear Tree
files were redacted.

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:30.068
DSU Powell informed us

01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:32.999
that PCC Sindwhani took no part
in the selection process,

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.079
but it was agreed
his Senior Legal Counsel

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.639
would act on his behalf.

01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:38.281
I don't need to remind everyone

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:41.559
there's been controversies
surrounding undercover operations.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:46.719
The PCC required assurances that
Pear Tree was legally watertight.

01:03:46.720 --> 01:03:48.479
According to DSU Powell,

01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.039
the Senior Legal Counsel
strongly favoured Corbett

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.719
and was instrumental in selecting him.

01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.689
Corbett had a distinguished record

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.519
handling the perils of being embedded

01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:00.439
inside an organised crime group.

01:04:00.440 --> 01:04:03.079
He was by far the best man for the job.

01:04:03.740 --> 01:04:07.839
Ms Biggeloe, when did you first
become aware of John Corbett?

01:04:08.260 --> 01:04:12.860
When we looked at the files
to select an undercover officer.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.039
Gill Biggeloe, you do not have to
say anything

01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:18.510
but it may harm your defence if you
do not mention when questioned

01:04:18.511 --> 01:04:19.863
something you later rely on in court.

01:04:19.864 --> 01:04:22.280
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

01:04:28.773 --> 01:04:29.973
OK.

01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:32.879
Well, given that the DIR's off,

01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:35.919
I'd like to make my own
personal recording.

01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:37.479
Any objections?

01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.999
I think we need to take
a step back, actually.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:42.359
Recording on.

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:45.559
If you could kindly bear with us, ma'am.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.900
Ms Biggeloe, did you
ever meet John Corbett?

01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:51.319
I refer you to my previous response.

01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.719
DS Arnott.

01:04:52.720 --> 01:04:55.185
As part of our inquiry,
we interviewed Corbett's widow,

01:04:55.186 --> 01:04:57.079
Stephanie. On the first occasion,

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:59.839
she confirmed Corbett's
upbringing in Northern Ireland.

01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:01.629
Following our interview with DSU Powell,

01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:04.359
we went back to Mrs Corbett
with some specific questions

01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:07.439
regarding John Corbett's recruitment
to Operation Pear Tree.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.799
We managed to convince her to
cooperate with our inquiry

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.919
and reveal hitherto undisclosed evidence.

01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:15.079
Following a lawful search
of the family home

01:05:15.080 --> 01:05:16.759
under Mrs Corbett's guidance,

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:19.199
we recovered items concealed
by her husband.

01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:21.759
Among the items was
an audio recording of a meeting

01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.839
between John Corbett and Gill Biggeloe

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:25.639
which took place in January 2018,

01:05:25.640 --> 01:05:29.319
a full month before the inception
of Operation Pear Tree.

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.959
Well, if such a recording exists,
it's inadmissible.

01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:35.559
That is correct that if acting
on official police business,

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.156
Corbett would have required
authorisation from Ripa.

01:05:39.157 --> 01:05:42.039
Yeah, well, he wasn't acting on
official police business,

01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.279
and I can assure you that
my legal team and I

01:05:44.280 --> 01:05:45.799
will move heaven and Earth

01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:49.300
so that this particular recording
will be heard in court.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.679
Playing recording.

01:05:51.680 --> 01:05:54.599
The RUC officer who betrayed your mother,

01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:56.340
his name's Hastings.

01:05:57.200 --> 01:06:00.940
Superintendent Ted Hastings.

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:05.759
He's a Super now. That's taking the piss.

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.439
How do you know all this?

01:06:07.440 --> 01:06:10.879
From a private investigator who's
been looking into Hastings' past.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:14.159
It's all in the file, chapter and verse.

01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:18.839
You read it and then tell me
how you feel about my proposal.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.580
I'm in. Tell me now.

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.480
We're setting up an undercover
operation to prove he's bent.

01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:27.679
To finally bring down the man

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.759
who had your mother killed.

01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.999
And it's definitely him, Hastings?

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.040
Yeah.

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.839
Gill Biggeloe sought incriminating
material on Superintendent Hastings

01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.425
and then used it to manipulate
John Corbett

01:06:42.426 --> 01:06:46.200
into believing
Superintendent Hastings is H.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:49.740
Why, Gill?

01:06:57.560 --> 01:06:59.359
It's complicated.

01:06:59.627 --> 01:07:00.867
We've got time.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.260
Actually, you don't.

01:07:07.120 --> 01:07:09.960
I'm TFC! Guns down. Stand by!

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.879
OK. We need to shut
this building down right now.

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.180
- Guns down now!
- Do as he says.

01:07:17.680 --> 01:07:20.319
TFC now. Received, moving in.

01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.879
Guns down.

01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.599
Hands where we can see them.

01:07:23.600 --> 01:07:26.020
- Hands above your head.
- Who authorised this?

01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:29.999
We detected apparent security lapses
on entering the building.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.879
The SFC authorised us to deploy firearms.

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:35.600
All your AFOs are being
disarmed as a precaution.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.439
This burner phone,

01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:46.559
it isn't the same burner phone
that I've been accused of owning,

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.679
by any chance, Tina, is it?

01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.599
Tina, the number.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.220
07700900856.

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.479
Oh, yeah.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:02.959
There it is.

01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:06.239
You see Gill only ever visited me
when she came to AC-12.

01:08:06.240 --> 01:08:09.300
That's how you mistook
this phone for mine.

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:14.900
TFC, 6-4, any obs on OCG?

01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.540
6-4, no contact yet, stand by.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:22.519
Looks like the cavalry's
not coming over the hill.

01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:26.198
Yeah, the last time Dot Cottan
sent that message out,

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:28.879
he was busted out in a couple of seconds.

01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:31.399
Looks like you're not as valuable as him.

01:08:31.399 --> 01:08:34.118
Or as valuable as you thought you were.

01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:36.078
As valuable to who exactly?

01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:39.198
Well, Gill told me that
she was a defence solicitor.

01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:41.719
You're going to meet a lot of
shady types doing that job.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:46.839
So you get some major piece of work
off a serious criminal charge,

01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.839
they put you on a retainer.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:52.519
But these retainers, they come with
strings attached, don't they, Gill?

01:08:52.520 --> 01:08:55.460
But I suspect that she was
enticed by the glamour.

01:08:56.399 --> 01:08:57.879
Why frame the gaffer?

01:08:57.880 --> 01:09:00.479
It's always more palatable
to offer up a rotten apple

01:09:00.479 --> 01:09:03.919
than to uncover
institutionalised corruption.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:09.198
And as AC-12 have been a constant
thorn in the side of the OCG,

01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.040
what better rotten apple than their
commanding officer, right, Gill?

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.399
The money in the hotel room,
where did that come from?

01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:24.359
I bet you asked some of
your little criminal mates

01:09:24.359 --> 01:09:27.238
to slip that through to Moffatt,
am I right?

01:09:27.240 --> 01:09:30.198
There's damning DNA evidence
against Superintendent Hastings.

01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:34.319
Hardly damning, a couple
of hair follicles? Come on.

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:40.926
Hang on.

01:09:42.953 --> 01:09:44.953
Don't tell me, was that your doing, Gill?

01:09:46.166 --> 01:09:47.604
Don't worry, Ted,

01:09:47.630 --> 01:09:50.350
I'll spare your blushes
in front of everyone.

01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:55.580
Gill used the bathroom of my hotel room.

01:09:56.120 --> 01:09:59.199
She must have taken some hairs
out of the comb,

01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.540
passed them on to the OCG and
they planted them on Corbett's body.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.720
Who killed Corbett?

01:10:07.919 --> 01:10:09.399
Did you give the order?

01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:15.359
We all know confessing
to conspiracy to murder

01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.460
will make me ineligible
for immunity from prosecution.

01:10:21.160 --> 01:10:24.412
And the institutionalised
complicity between organised crime

01:10:24.413 --> 01:10:26.340
and corrupt police officers?

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:29.439
Have you not been listening, love?

01:10:29.440 --> 01:10:31.279
There's no such thing.

01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:33.160
I'm just one rotten apple.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.799
Well, never mind betraying me, Gill.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:39.559
Never mind framing me.
What about John Corbett?

01:10:39.560 --> 01:10:43.300
I mean, you let him believe
that he was chasing the truth.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.559
Justice for his mother,

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.879
for Christ's sake, for Anne-Marie.

01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.199
But instead he was chasing a lie.

01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:52.919
You set it running,

01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.719
then you sat around as you watched
the dogs rip it apart.

01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:59.620
A tragic, senseless death.

01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:08.359
3-7, 6-4, sit rep.

01:11:08.360 --> 01:11:10.580
6-4, still no obs.

01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:12.300
Received.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.319
Ma'am, it appears we no longer need
to defend ourselves

01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.919
against a threat in this building.

01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.319
I suggest we make arrangements

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:21.119
to transport
Miss Biggeloe to custody ASAP.

01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.599
Agreed.

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:25.319
- I'll take care of that, ma'am.
- Thank you, Tina.

01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:27.559
Gill Biggeloe,
you are under arrest for perverting

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:30.640
the course of justice
and misconduct in a public office.

01:11:32.720 --> 01:11:35.300
Sir, I'd advise you
get out the building too.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.220
Yeah. Thank you, Kate.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.839
I'm afraid I'm going to have to cuff you.

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:49.319
Could be a trek to custody. You
might want to do a loo break now.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.999
Thank you.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:53.360
Going to have to come with you,
I'm sorry.

01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:58.199
- 3-7, 6-4.
- 6-4 receiving.

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:01.039
We're sending down DCS Carmichael
and the gaffer.

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:04.119
We'll keep Gill Biggeloe up here
until we can provide escort.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.540
- 6-4, received.
- Thanks, you two.

01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:08.679
I don't know what to say.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.439
You're welcome, sir.

01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.940
Just doing our job.

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:14.740
It's a damn sight more than that.

01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:20.760
I could murder a cuppa.

01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:06.639
Ah!

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.760
Help!

01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.480
Drop it!

01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.799
Alpha Charlie 3-7, request urgent casevac

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:28.399
from AC-12 for two persons,

01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.679
one low-velocity GSW, one knife wound.

01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:33.359
- Gill, are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:34.620
Steve.

01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.180
Steve, are you all right?

01:13:39.526 --> 01:13:41.006
I never shot anybody.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:52.560
Can you confirm, premises now secure?

01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:55.799
Yes, confirmed.

01:14:01.806 --> 01:14:03.086
Do you think she'll talk?

01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.119
She'll want to make a deal.

01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:08.900
Too fond of the finer things
to do a prison stretch.

01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:24.639
The OCG didn't think Gill
was worth saving,

01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.000
but someone gave the order
to stop her talking.

01:14:29.526 --> 01:14:30.966
Who?

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.460
What is it?

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.680
Out of the way.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:10.520
I'll start bagging, respiratory arrest...

01:15:12.640 --> 01:15:15.719
Gone through my solicitor,
and she's advised me

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:17.719
to cooperate with your inquiry

01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:20.759
but it all depends if there's
definitely immunity

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.820
from prosecution, and witness protection.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:25.680
I want to help.

01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:28.839
Maybe I could do something

01:15:28.840 --> 01:15:31.239
to stop others from making
the same mistakes.

01:15:31.240 --> 01:15:35.319
Immunity from prosecution and
witness protection has been agreed.

01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:38.020
There is one final gap
we need to fill in.

01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:42.119
How did you know that John Clayton
was an undercover officer,

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.400
DS John Corbett?

01:15:44.853 --> 01:15:45.893
I didn't.

01:15:46.880 --> 01:15:48.399
Just that he was a rat.

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:49.620
How?

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.520
The leak about the meeting
at the Palisades.

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:55.919
It could have only come from him.

01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:57.759
How did that work?

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:01.559
John was told the top man wanted
to meet at the shopping centre.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:04.399
We had a meeting point
on one of the walkways.

01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:07.199
It was nice and public
so if anyone spotted us

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.600
they'd think twice about
trying to take us out.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.280
No-one else in the unit knew about
the meet except for me and John.

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.719
We had one of our blokes working
the shopping centre in security.

01:16:18.720 --> 01:16:21.479
He said he'd seen the coppers
waiting to ambush us.

01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:24.860
So we knew for certain the leak
had to come from John.

01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:28.260
What did Lee Banks reveal to you
about John Corbett?

01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:31.040
Only that there was a rat in the unit.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:35.759
Hastings told Lee Banks
about Corbett, I'm sure of it.

01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.280
She's lying to cover herself.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.159
She knows if she admits
to killing Corbett

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:42.800
then she forfeits immunity
from prosecution.

01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:46.319
What does Banks say?

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:47.920
He's still not talking.

01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:51.399
Then, without his testimony,

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:54.200
you can't prove Hastings blew
Corbett's cover.

01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:57.359
It's a dead end, Patricia.
Close the case.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:01.220
- Ma'am, I think if I can just keep...
- You had a bent officer on your team.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.800
Glass houses.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.679
Which OCG members were involved

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:14.119
in the murder of John Corbett?

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:15.780
A few of them.

01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:18.879
Not me.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:20.559
They're all dead now.

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:22.159
Who inflicted the fatal knife wound

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:24.640
that caused John Corbett
to bleed to death?

01:17:26.120 --> 01:17:27.480
He's dead now too.

01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.640
Miroslav Minkowicz.

01:17:32.240 --> 01:17:35.100
Are there any members
of the OCG still at large?

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:38.280
Not that I know of.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:50.479
Where I grew up, it was easy
to fall in with the wrong crowd.

01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:54.320
My mum, she was off her face on
drink and drugs a lot of the time.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.857
The person who made me see
that there was another way,

01:17:57.858 --> 01:17:59.752
to be a useful member of society,

01:17:59.753 --> 01:18:02.720
was a police officer, PC Simon Bannerjee.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:06.540
He's the reason why I wanted
to become a police officer too.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.880
To help people.

01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.680
- Sir.
- Sir.

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:26.359
We've been re-examining
Dot's dying declaration.

01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:28.879
Now, the frame it was frozen on
during your interview

01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:30.879
made me spot something we've all missed.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.640
Look at Dot's left hand.

01:18:39.213 --> 01:18:40.413
Watch again.

01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:47.680
Right, so his fingers are tapping. So?

01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:51.999
Dot was trying to tell us something
before he lost consciousness.

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.519
He couldn't speak due to
the gunshot wound to his chest,

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.120
but he could move his hand.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:19:00.980
Tap, tap, tap-tap.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:05.080
Tap, tap, tap, tap.

01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.879
Morse code.

01:19:08.880 --> 01:19:12.180
Dot, dot, dot, dot.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.560
The letter H in Morse Code is four dots.

01:19:16.760 --> 01:19:18.679
H is not an initial.

01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.119
It's a clue.

01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:21.519
Four Dots.

01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.079
Four Caddies.

01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.959
Four police staff
in league with organised crime.

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:27.559
Dot.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.119
Hilton.

01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:30.360
Gill.

01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:33.120
Plus one more.

01:19:34.399 --> 01:19:35.879
And they're still out there.

01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.679
The Deputy Chief Constable
and I are pleased to report

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:44.959
Operation Pear Tree has completed
a thorough investigation

01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:46.999
into institutionalised complicity

01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:51.079
between organised criminals
and corrupt police officers.

01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:54.239
Its robust findings couldn't be clearer,

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:57.900
there is no institutionalised
corruption in this police force.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.479
This constabulary will work
tirelessly to root out

01:20:01.480 --> 01:20:03.879
rotten apples in its ranks...
