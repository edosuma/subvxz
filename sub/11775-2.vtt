00:05.773 --> 00:08.076
( theme music playing )

00:15.916 --> 00:18.686
- ( woman crying )
- Woman Â£2: IT'S OKAY.
LET IT GO.

00:18.786 --> 00:23.057
LET IT GO.
THIS IS PUSHING BUTTONS,
AND THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

00:23.157 --> 00:25.926
- NO, YOU'RE SAFE,
YOU'RE SAFE.
- UH...

00:26.026 --> 00:28.596
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
LET IT GO.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.532
- OH MY. OH.
- UH...

00:33.201 --> 00:35.436
- OH.
- I JUST WANT TO GET
SOME CHUBBY HUBBY.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.805
SIR, COULD YOU PLEASE
GIVE US A MOMENT?

00:37.905 --> 00:40.341
YEAH, AW.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.642
AW AW.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.145
YES, AW.

00:44.245 --> 00:47.115
A LITTLE TO THE LEFT...
OR THE RIGHT.

00:47.215 --> 00:52.120
- SEPARATE SEPARATE.
- EXCUSE ME.

00:52.220 --> 00:53.954
I'M TRYING TO GET
TO THE CHUBBY HUBBY.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.256
- YES, YOU SAID THAT.
- YEAH.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.659
YES, OKAY,
THAT'S A GOOD GIRL.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.362
OH OH MY.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.331
POOR BABY.

01:03.431 --> 01:06.400
SIR! EXCUSE ME.
NOW I'VE TRIED TO BE NICE.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.103
I HAVE ASKED YOU
TO GIVE US SOME SPACE.

01:09.203 --> 01:12.473
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.275
PERSONAL--
IT'S A PERSONAL THING?

01:14.375 --> 01:17.711
- WOULD YOU PLEASE?
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.947
THANK YOU.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.650
DON'T PAY ATTENTION
TO THAT JERK.

01:22.750 --> 01:26.053
OH, IT'S OKAY.

01:26.154 --> 01:29.022
OH, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT,
SWEETHEART?

01:29.123 --> 01:31.559
IT'S GONNA BE--

01:31.659 --> 01:34.162
Marty:
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO BELIEVE THIS.

01:34.262 --> 01:36.964
RICHARD IS DATING
A BURLESQUE DANCER.

01:37.064 --> 01:38.266
- I HAD DINNER WITH THEM.
- REALLY?

01:38.366 --> 01:39.833
I DON'T LIKE TO SOUND
LIKE A PIG,

01:39.933 --> 01:42.069
BUT SHE HAS
MAGNIFICENT BREASTS.

01:42.170 --> 01:44.472
- WHAT'S SHE LIKE?
- SHE'S DUMB.

01:44.572 --> 01:46.240
( snickers )

01:46.340 --> 01:49.910
ALL SHE WANTED TO TALK ABOUT
WAS HOW SHE DANCES,

01:50.010 --> 01:51.879
HOW THE CROWD
LOVES HER AND--

01:51.979 --> 01:53.214
- OH, HERE HE IS.
- I'M SORRY.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.150
- HUH?
- LET ME ALONE.
DON'T YELL AT ME.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.552
THEY MOVED THE AUDITION.
IT'S IN 10 MINUTES.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.054
I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH AN EX-GIRLFRIEND
WHO WAS SUICIDAL,

02:01.155 --> 02:04.492
SO I COULDN'T EXACTLY
HANG UP TO SAY I WANT
TO GO TO A SALAD BAR.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.394
WAIT, SHE'S GOING
TO COMMIT SUICIDE
AND SHE CALLS YOU?

02:06.494 --> 02:08.596
A LOT OF PEOPLE CALL ME
WHO ARE SUICIDAL.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.464
I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE
MY SUICIDE CALL.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.300
- YOU'RE KIDDING ME.
- NO, I DON'T THINK YOU'D BE.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.235
WHAT WOULD BRING YOU
TO THE BRINK OF SUICIDE?

02:14.335 --> 02:15.936
CAN I ASK HIM
WHY HE WOULDN'T
CALL ME FIRST?

02:16.036 --> 02:17.004
- WHAT WOULD BRING YOU--
- HIM.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.439
- HE WOULD?
- HE WOULD.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.641
SO YOU'D BE CALLING THE GUY
WHO CAUSED YOU TO-- OKAY.

02:20.741 --> 02:23.010
BY THE WAY, ARE YOU DATING
A BURLESQUE DANCER?

02:23.110 --> 02:25.479
- WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
- WE HEARD.

02:25.579 --> 02:28.182
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING BAD.
I SAID SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.318
- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO BLAB
ABOUT MY PERSONAL LIFE?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

02:30.418 --> 02:32.253
YOU DIDN'T
SWEAR HIM TO SECRECY.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

02:32.353 --> 02:34.154
HEY, IF IT WASN'T
FOR FUCKING BURLESQUE,

02:34.255 --> 02:35.556
WE WOULDN'T HAVE CHAPLIN
OR THE MARX BROTHERS.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.292
OH, CHAPLIN WAS
A GREAT POLE DANCER.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.093
ADMIT IT, THE ONLY REASON
YOU'RE GOING OUT WITH HER

02:40.194 --> 02:41.529
IS BECAUSE
OF HER AMPLE BOSOM.

02:41.629 --> 02:43.797
THAT'S DESPICABLE
TO SAY THAT TO ME.
OF COURSE NOT.

02:43.897 --> 02:48.135
- FOR HER BRAINS
AND HER SENSE OF WORTH.
- HAVE YOU SET A DATE ASIDE

02:48.236 --> 02:50.170
WHEN YOU'RE GOING
TO FINALLY LOOK
AT HER FACE?

02:50.271 --> 02:52.139
( laughing )

02:52.240 --> 02:54.208
THAT'S--
THAT'S REALLY FUNNY.

02:54.308 --> 02:55.676
YEAH, LAUGH IT UP.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.213
LISTEN, I HAVE
AN AUDITION NOW,
SO IF YOU DON'T MIND.

02:59.313 --> 03:00.981
- I'LL SEE YOU LATER.
- THAT'S VERY FUNNY.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.950
THAT'S IT?
YOU COME FOR TWO MINUTES?

03:03.050 --> 03:05.085
- I TOLD YOU WHY I'M LATE.
I HAVE AN AUDITION.
- ALL RIGHT.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.554
QUITE FRANKLY
I'M A LITTLE OFFENDED

03:06.654 --> 03:09.223
BY YOU JUST FOCUSING
ON A WOMAN'S BREASTS
AND NIPPLES

03:09.323 --> 03:10.624
WHEN MAYBE I'M IN LOVE
WITH HER, ALL RIGHT?

03:10.724 --> 03:11.992
- SO HOW DOES THAT--
- YOU'RE ALWAYS IN LOVE.

03:12.092 --> 03:13.494
NO, I'M NOT ALWAYS IN LOVE.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.796
SHE ALSO GIVES TO CHARITY
AND SHE HAS A GREAT PERSONALITY.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.130
- SHE GIVES TO CHARITY?
- THAT'S RIGHT.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.666
- Jeff: MILK?
- HUH?

03:18.766 --> 03:19.900
- Jeff: SHE GIVES MILK?
- THAT'S FUNNY TOO?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.569
YOU GUYS ARE
ON A FUCKIN' ROLL.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.737
- I'M OUT.
- DANCE FOR
UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS.

03:23.837 --> 03:26.874
- CHARITY!
- Marty: GIVES TO CHARITY?

03:26.974 --> 03:29.843
- ALL RIGHT, I GOTTA GO.
- LOOK AT THE STUFF THAT
COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.712
- I GOT AN IDEA.
- Jeff: HMM?

03:31.812 --> 03:35.616
WHY DON'T THE THREE OF US,
ONE NIGHT THIS WEEK,
GO SEE HER DANCE?

03:35.716 --> 03:38.118
- HELL YES.
- WE'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.388
NO, LET'S GO.
HE NEVER SAID WE COULDN'T.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.089
WE CAN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO HIM.

03:42.189 --> 03:43.891
WHO'S GONNA--
HE DOESN'T NEED TO KNOW.

03:43.991 --> 03:46.327
WE SIT IN THE BACK.
I SAY WE GO.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.462
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I DON'T NEED TO DO THAT.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.698
- I DID A HANDS IN.
- PLEASE, WE DON'T
NEED A HANDS IN.

03:50.798 --> 03:52.232
I'M GONNA GET GOING.
YOU GOT LUNCH?

03:52.333 --> 03:55.469
- I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.170
YEAH, LET'S GO SEE HER.
WHAT THE HELL?

03:57.271 --> 04:00.007
OH, YOU'LL LOVE IT,
BELIEVE ME.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.244
EXCUSE ME, I'VE JUST GOTTA
RUN OUT FOR ONE SECOND.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.213
COULD YOU JUST KEEP AN EYE
ON MY COMPUTER FOR ME?

04:06.314 --> 04:08.482
- SURE.
- THANKS.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.468
EXCUSE ME.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.603
WOULD YOU MIND KEEPING
AN EYE ON THAT COMPUTER?

04:29.703 --> 04:32.840
- THE GUY ASKED ME,
BUT I HAVE TO GO.
- UM, YEAH SURE, OKAY.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.275
GOOD, THANKS.

04:50.724 --> 04:51.925
AHA!

04:52.025 --> 04:54.562
HA HA!

04:55.396 --> 04:57.965
OKAY, THIS IS THE DOG.

04:58.065 --> 05:00.601
THIS IS THE DOG
THAT'S BEEN GOING
ON MY LAWN.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.703
- NO BAG?
WHERE'S YOUR BAG?
- WELL...

05:02.803 --> 05:04.738
YOU KNOW, LIFE-- IT GETS
SO CRAZY SOMETIMES.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.474
- OH, LIFE GETS CRAZY?
- YEAH.

05:06.574 --> 05:08.008
IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A DOG,
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BAG.

05:08.108 --> 05:10.378
I WILL BRING A BAG.
I DIDN'T BRING A BAG TODAY.

05:10.478 --> 05:14.548
- I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- BECAUSE THE DOG WITHOUT
THE BAG-- IT'S INCOMPLETE.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.250
IT'S A MARRIAGE.
THE BAG AND THE DOG,
THEY GO TOGETHER.

05:17.351 --> 05:19.186
I JUST DON'T SEE
WHY YOU HAD TO YELL AT ME.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.188
I'M YELLING FOR SOCIETY,
FOR EVERYBODY.

05:21.288 --> 05:22.723
- IT'S NOT JUST ME.
- GOT IT.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.925
- PEOPLE MAKE MISTAKES.
- EVERY DAY?

05:25.025 --> 05:26.894
ROSCOE, COME.

05:26.994 --> 05:30.297
( jazz music playing )

05:30.398 --> 05:32.332
Marty:
DON'T YOU LOVE THIS PLACE?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.468
- Leon: THIS SHIT
IS FUCKING AMAZING.
- Marty: IT'S GREAT.

05:34.568 --> 05:35.969
- YEAH.
- DO YOU LOVE IT?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.871
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M LOOKING FOR LEWIS.

05:37.971 --> 05:39.540
LET LOOSE.
HE'S NOT HERE.
HAVE A GOOD TIME.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.141
Marty:
WE OUGHT TO DO THIS
MORE OFTEN.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.076
COME TO DISGUSTING
STRIP CLUBS?

05:43.176 --> 05:45.546
- WHY IS IT DISGUSTING?
- DISGUSTING? FUCKIN'--
THAT'S A HARSH WORD.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.982
- WATCH THIS SHIT.
- ( crowd cheering )

05:49.082 --> 05:51.585
- THAT'S HER.
THAT'S HER.
- THAT'S HER?

05:53.887 --> 05:57.391
IT'S LIKE JELL-O PUDDING
INSIDE OF THOSE MOTHERFUCKERS.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.893
SHE IS COMMUNICATING RIGHT NOW.
YOU UNDERSTAND?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.929
IN HAWAII THEY MOVE
HANDS AND HIPS.

06:02.029 --> 06:03.397
OUT HERE IT'S TITTIES.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.732
THE FUCKIN' TITTIES
ARE TALKING RIGHT NOW.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.634
AND WHAT EXACTLY
ARE THEY SAYING?

06:06.734 --> 06:09.069
THOSE TITTIES
ARE A BLABBERMOUTH, YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

06:09.169 --> 06:11.439
THEY'RE FUCKIN' JUST
YIPPITY-YAPPING RIGHT NOW.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.608
( crowd cheering )

06:22.983 --> 06:25.919
( slurping )

06:27.655 --> 06:30.290
- DID YOU HAVE FUN?
- NO, NOT REALLY.

06:30.390 --> 06:32.593
- BOY, I HAD A BLAST.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.228
- WHAT?
- I THINK LEWIS
HAS LOST HIS MIND.

06:35.328 --> 06:38.031
- WHY?
- I JUST SAW HIS GIRLFRIEND'S
TITS, THAT'S WHY.

06:38.131 --> 06:41.602
SO WHAT?
HE'S NOT GONNA MARRY HER.
HE'S JUST HAVING FUN.

06:53.714 --> 06:56.817
HOW CAN YOU NOT TELL ME
YOU WERE GOING TO SEE STELLA?

06:56.917 --> 06:59.052
- SHE'S MY GIRLFRIEND,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES.
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:59.152 --> 07:00.353
WE PROBABLY SHOULD
HAVE TOLD YOU.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.355
BUT YOU DIDN'T SAY
WE SHOULDN'T GO.

07:02.456 --> 07:05.826
AND BY THE WAY, IF YOU'RE
DATING SOMEBODY WHO TAKES
THEIR CLOTHES OFF IN PUBLIC,

07:05.926 --> 07:08.128
THEN WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?
EVERYBODY'S GONNA SEE HER.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.430
YOU WENT THERE
LIKE A PERVERT.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.965
HEY, I DIDN'T
EVEN SEE THAT MUCH.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.167
WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE SHOW
DID YOU LOOK AT HER BREASTS?

07:14.267 --> 07:15.335
- I SAW LIKE--
- HELLO, TIGER.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.470
HI, HONEY.
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.671
HI, SWEETIE.
SORRY I'M LATE.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.673
THIS IS LARRY,
ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.509
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.
I'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.
- HI.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.343
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
HE WAS OLD.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.613
- YOU DON'T SEEM THAT OLD.
- WELL--

07:25.713 --> 07:27.915
- SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO OFFEND YOU.
- MRS. COLE,

07:28.015 --> 07:31.018
I DIDN'T KNOW MARILYN MONROE
WAS ON THE BASE, SIR.

07:31.118 --> 07:33.854
HE MADE OUT LIKE YOU WERE
A GRANDDAD, YOU KNOW?

07:33.954 --> 07:35.122
YOU CALLED ME OLD?

07:35.222 --> 07:37.124
YOU'RE TWO DAYS
OLDER THAN I AM.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.660
YOU'RE A DISSIPATED ALCOHOLIC.
HOW DARE YOU?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.428
- RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC.
- ALL RIGHT, RECOVERING.

07:41.529 --> 07:44.097
OKAY, LISTEN, SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO START
AN ARGUMENT OR ANYTHING.

07:44.197 --> 07:47.868
THAT'S OKAY.
BY THE WAY, I ACTUALLY DID
SEE YOUR SHOW LAST NIGHT.

07:47.968 --> 07:51.772
- YOU CAME TO SEE MY SHOW?
- YES, I ENJOYED
THE PRESENTATION.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.340
WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT BURLESQUE?

07:53.440 --> 07:55.008
I SAW THE MOVIE "GYPSY"
WITH NATALIE WOOD.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.845
OH, THEN YOU SHOULD BE
A PROFESSOR AT OHIO STATE
AND TEACH THIS.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.847
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU APPRECIATE
THE ART FORM.

07:59.947 --> 08:01.549
WELL, I APPRECIATE
NAKED WOMEN.

08:01.649 --> 08:03.651
DID YOU LIKE
THE AIR FUCKING
NUMBER I DID?

08:03.751 --> 08:05.686
- THE AIR FUCKING
WAS SENSATIONAL.
- YOU LIKED THAT?

08:05.786 --> 08:06.854
- YEAH YEAH?
- YES.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.556
BUT LET ME JUST
SAY THIS, OKAY?

08:08.656 --> 08:10.591
YOUR BREASTS
ARE MAGNIFICENT.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.026
- OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
- WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?

08:13.126 --> 08:15.495
YOU'RE NOT DISSECTING A FROG
IN 12th-GRADE BIOLOGY.

08:15.596 --> 08:18.231
- IT'S OKAY.
I TAKE IT AS A COMPLIMENT.
- SHE'S NOT A SPECIMEN.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.434
BY THE WAY, I DID
NOTICE IN THE SHOW

08:21.535 --> 08:24.337
THAT THERE'S A SMALL MOLE

08:24.437 --> 08:25.839
ON THE UNDERSIDE
OF YOUR RIGHT BREAST

08:25.939 --> 08:27.641
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO GET CHECKED OUT.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.610
- ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS?
THERE'S A MOLE?
- YEAH YEAH YEAH.

08:29.710 --> 08:34.447
- OKAY.
- HOW DID YOU SEE A SMALL MOLE
FROM WHERE YOU WERE SITTING?

08:34.548 --> 08:36.249
I HAVE BREAST VISION
AND THAT'S HOW I'M ABLE TO--

08:36.349 --> 08:37.585
- YOU HAVE BREAST VISION?
- YES.

08:37.685 --> 08:38.886
WHY DON'T YOU GO
TO EVERY BURLESQUE SHOW

08:38.986 --> 08:40.821
AND JUST STARE
AT ALL THE BREASTS?

08:40.921 --> 08:42.522
I COULD BE A BURLESQUE
DERMATOLOGIST.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.558
- WE'LL GET IT CHECKED OUT.
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

08:44.658 --> 08:46.660
- FOR SURE.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:49.830 --> 08:52.666
WELL WELL WELL,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.469
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME?
- NO.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.438
I'M THE IDIOT
WHO ASKED YOU

08:58.538 --> 09:01.909
TO LOOK AFTER MY COMPUTER
YESTERDAY, REMEMBER?

09:02.009 --> 09:05.145
- YEAH. SO WHERE IS IT?
- YOU DIDN'T GET THAT BACK?

09:05.245 --> 09:07.280
NO, I DIDN'T GET IT BACK.
WHY AM I ASKING YOU?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.618
I DIDN'T GET IT BACK
AND IT'S GONE AND
SO WERE YOU.

09:10.718 --> 09:12.452
YOU WERE TAKING
SUCH A LONG TIME.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.788
I HAD TO GET GOING
AND I GAVE IT TO SOMEONE.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.724
- WHO DID YOU GIVE IT TO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

09:16.824 --> 09:19.492
- I GAVE IT TO SOME BLACK GUY.
- YOU GAVE IT TO SOME BLACK GUY?

09:19.593 --> 09:22.562
- YEAH.
- YOU GAVE IT
TO A BLACK GUY?!

09:27.234 --> 09:31.204
BECAUSE THAT'S--
I MEAN--

09:31.304 --> 09:34.174
WHAT I WAS ABOUT
TO SAY WAS

09:34.274 --> 09:37.177
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GIVE IT
TO A BLACK PERSON?

09:37.277 --> 09:40.380
IN FACT, THAT DAY
WHEN WE WERE IN THERE,

09:40.480 --> 09:42.515
I HAD BEEN LOOKING
FOR A BLACK PERSON

09:42.616 --> 09:44.151
TO LEAVE
MY COMPUTER WITH.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.219
I DIDN'T SEE ONE,
SO I LEFT IT WITH YOU.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.688
LEFT IT WITH ME.
GOOD GOOD.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.757
I'M SURE
IT'S GONNA TURN UP.

09:49.857 --> 09:52.159
- I'LL KEEP MY EYES
PEELED FOR HIM.
- I'M GONNA GO IN.

09:52.259 --> 09:55.095
- HE'S PROBABLY DROPPED
IT OFF IN THERE.
- PROBABLY DROPPED IT OFF.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.797
- TAKE CARE.
- OKAY.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.966
Leon:
LARRY! ( laughs )

09:59.066 --> 10:01.101
WHAT UP, MAN?

10:01.201 --> 10:04.371
OH, UH... NOTHING.

10:04.471 --> 10:07.107
- WHO'S THAT DUDE, MAN?
- WELL, I MEAN IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL.

10:07.207 --> 10:09.977
HE GAVE ME HIS COMPUTER
TO WATCH...

10:10.077 --> 10:11.779
- UH-HUH.
- ...AND I HAD TO LEAVE.

10:11.879 --> 10:13.647
AND I GAVE IT
TO THIS GUY

10:13.747 --> 10:16.083
AND HE NEVER GAVE
THE COMPUTER BACK.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.685
WHO THE FUCK
DID YOU GIVE IT TO?

10:17.785 --> 10:19.787
IT WAS A GUY.
NOT IMPORTANT.

10:19.887 --> 10:23.390
WHO THE FUCK
DID YOU GIVE IT TO?

10:23.490 --> 10:24.825
A BLACK GUY.

10:24.925 --> 10:27.828
- WOW.
- I'M SORRY.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.629
- GOD DAMN.
- I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.665
- A FUCKIN'
BLACK DUDE IN THERE--
- YOU FORCED IT OUT OF ME.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.100
I FEEL FUCKIN' BAD NOW.
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

10:33.200 --> 10:34.802
YOU TRUSTED THAT
BLACK MOTHERFUCKER.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.203
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- YEAH.

10:36.303 --> 10:37.771
I DON'T WANT YOU THINKING
THAT SHIT ABOUT ME,

10:37.871 --> 10:39.039
YOU UNDERSTAND?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.507
I COULD'VE STOLE
THIS MOTHERFUCKER...

10:40.607 --> 10:42.109
PLENTY OF TIMES,
BUT I DIDN'T.

10:42.209 --> 10:43.944
I KNOW THE CODE
TO THE FUCKIN' HOUSE AND SHIT.

10:44.044 --> 10:45.846
3948, RIGHT?
THE LAST FOUR

10:45.946 --> 10:47.715
OF YOUR SOCIAL SECURITY CARD
NUMBER IS 4938.

10:47.815 --> 10:48.749
ALL YOU DID
WAS CHANGE IT AROUND.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.117
ALL THAT SHIT
I FUCKIN' KNOW.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.985
REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU GAVE ME THE ATM CARD

10:52.085 --> 10:53.486
TO GET GAS FOR THE CAR
AND SHIT?

10:53.586 --> 10:54.788
AND YOUR SIGNATURE--
COME ON.

10:54.888 --> 10:56.523
IT'S A BIG L.
IT'S REAL CLEAR, RIGHT?

10:56.623 --> 10:58.458
THEN THE "ARRY DAVID"
IS SLOPPY.

10:58.558 --> 11:01.895
ANY MAN CAN DO THAT SHIT.
YOUR MOM'S MAIDEN NAME--
RATNER. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

11:01.995 --> 11:04.364
- ALL THEY WANNA
KNOW IS THAT PART.
- WHERE ARE THE CAR KEYS?

11:04.464 --> 11:06.166
- INSIDE THE CAR.
- I'LL DRIVE.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.535
WHO THE FUCK TOLD YOU
MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN NAME?!

11:08.635 --> 11:10.170
- I MUST'VE OVERHEARD IT.
- YOU'RE GOING THROUGH MY SHIT!

11:10.270 --> 11:11.839
THERE'S SHIT LAYING
AROUND THE HOUSE!

11:11.939 --> 11:14.241
WHERE THE FUCK
DID YOU FIND OUT
MY MOTHER'S MAIDEN...

11:14.341 --> 11:16.844
( doorbell rings )

11:18.678 --> 11:20.981
- OH, HI.
- HELLO.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.850
I'M YOUR NEIGHBOR
MARGARET.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.617
ACTUALLY,
I'M REALIZING NOW

11:24.718 --> 11:26.887
- THAT WE'VE RUN
INTO EACH OTHER BEFORE.
- THE SUPERMARKET.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.289
OH YEAH, THAT WAS KIND OF
AN AWKWARD THING THERE.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.324
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO GET SOME ICE CREAM.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.626
- I UNDERSTAND THAT.
I UNDERSTAND THAT.
- CHUBBY HUBBY.

11:33.727 --> 11:37.297
YOU WOULDN'T MOVE OVER.
IT WAS ODD.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.833
WELL, THERE WAS
A LITTLE MORE TO IT
THAN THAT.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.869
I KNOW THE WOMAN
WAS CRYING.
I SAW THAT.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.170
- RIGHT, YEAH.
- BUT STILL,

11:43.270 --> 11:45.172
SHE COULD HAVE CRIED
A FOOT OR TWO OVER.

11:45.272 --> 11:46.874
YOU SEE, THE REASON
SHE WAS CRYING

11:46.974 --> 11:49.943
IS SHE'S A NEW MEMBER
OF OUR SAFE HOUSE

11:50.043 --> 11:51.611
THAT I'M THE HOUSEMOTHER FOR.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.780
- SAFE HOUSE?
- YES.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.547
SOME PEOPLE CALL THEM
BATTERED WOMEN.

11:54.647 --> 11:56.649
- I CHOOSE NOT
TO USE THAT PHRASE.
- OH, THEY'RE BATTERED.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.151
I THINK
IT'S VERY PEJORATIVE.

11:58.251 --> 12:00.988
- SO ANYWAY--
- OH, WHERE'S THE HOUSE?

12:01.088 --> 12:03.656
- IT'S JUST A COUPLE
OF DOORS DOWN.
- SERIOUSLY?

12:03.757 --> 12:05.158
- YEAH.
- HUH.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.160
AND SPEAKING OF THOSE WOMEN,
A COUPLE OF DAYS AGO

12:07.260 --> 12:09.729
I THINK THERE WAS
A LITTLE INCIDENT

12:09.830 --> 12:11.331
WITH ONE OF OUR MEMBERS
AND HER DOG.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.134
SHE'S ALSO PART
OF THE SORORITY
OVER THERE?

12:14.234 --> 12:15.969
WELL, WE DON'T
CALL IT A SORORITY.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.338
- BUT YES, SHE IS ONE
OF OUR MEMBERS.
- OH MY GOD.

12:18.438 --> 12:21.608
AND SAUNDRA WAS SO UPSET
WHEN SHE CAME HOME.

12:21.708 --> 12:23.243
- SHE WAS UPSET?
- YES.

12:23.343 --> 12:25.378
HER DOG POOPED
ALL OVER MY LAWN
THREE TIMES.

12:25.478 --> 12:27.647
SHE DOESN'T CLEAN IT UP.
SHE DOESN'T BRING A BAG.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.250
WHAT WE WOULD LOVE
AS NEIGHBORS AND FRIENDS--

12:30.350 --> 12:33.320
TO INVITE YOU IN
TO START A DISCUSSION.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.790
AND YOU CAN TALK TO KAREN
AND YOU CAN TALK TO SAUNDRA

12:36.890 --> 12:38.859
AND YOU CAN BRING UP
YOUR ISSUES

12:38.959 --> 12:40.560
AND PERHAPS APOLOGIZE...

12:40.660 --> 12:43.063
- APOLOGIZE?
- ...FOR ANY DISCOMFORT
YOU CAUSED THEM.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.697
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I WOULD APOLOGIZE.

12:44.798 --> 12:46.399
- I DIDN'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING.
- WELL--

12:46.499 --> 12:48.969
- ALL I WANT TO DO
IS BUY SOME ICE CREAM.
- I KNOW.

12:49.069 --> 12:52.072
- ALL I WANT TO DO
IS HAVE A CLEAN LAWN...
- I UNDERSTAND.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.841
- ...WITHOUT POOP ON IT.
- EXACTLY.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.242
I DIDN'T REALLY
DO ANYTHING.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.344
AND YOU KNOW WHAT
WOULD BE WONDERFUL, LARRY?

12:57.444 --> 13:00.948
IS THAT SO MANY OF THESE WOMEN
HAVE A NEGATIVE CONNOTATION

13:01.048 --> 13:03.951
- AS FAR AS A MALE
PERSPECTIVE GOES.
- OF COURSE, YES.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.953
SO IT WOULD BE SO GREAT

13:06.053 --> 13:09.789
TO HAVE A SAFE MAN
IN THEIR MIDST

13:09.890 --> 13:11.859
THAT COULD GIVE THEM
A MALE PERSPECTIVE

13:11.959 --> 13:13.894
THAT THEY COULD FEEL GOOD
ABOUT HEARING.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.897
SO I WOULD BE
REPRESENTING MEN.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.631
IN A SAFE PLACE, YES.

13:18.731 --> 13:22.035
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?
- I'M HAPPY TO BE
THE MALE REPRESENTATIVE.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.304
OH MY GOODNESS,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.273
MAYBE I COULD DRUM UP
A DATE OVER THERE, HUH?

13:26.373 --> 13:30.010
OH, NOW LARRY,
LET'S REMEMBER BOUNDARIES.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.246
HI. A LITTLE BIT
OF A SURPRISE FOR
ALL OF YOU.

13:33.346 --> 13:37.550
- I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE OUR
NEIGHBOR AND FRIEND LARRY.
- HELLO.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.419
WHAT A GREAT PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU ALL.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.722
BY THE WAY, VERY NICE HOUSE,
IF YOU DON'T MIND MY SAYING.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.691
- BEAUTIFUL.
- Margaret: ISN'T IT NICE?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.459
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
YOU WERE LIVING BEFORE,

13:46.559 --> 13:48.795
BUT I WOULD THINK THIS
PROBABLY WOULD BE
A STEP UP.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.663
YOU HIT THE JACKPOT
WITH THIS PLACE, HUH?

13:50.763 --> 13:53.533
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY?
THANK YOU FOR ADMIRING
OUR HOME.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.103
YOU'RE REALLY HITTING
THE CAKE HERE, HUH?
AND DONUTS?

13:56.203 --> 13:58.271
YOU'RE WELCOME
TO HELP YOURSELF.

13:58.371 --> 14:00.073
I HOPE YOU GUYS
ARE WORKING OUT
EATING THIS--

14:00.173 --> 14:02.042
MY FATHER WOULD
CALL THIS CRAP.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.476
- ( laughs )
- THAT'S A LOT OF CRAP.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.547
LARRY, I THINK YOU MIGHT
REMEMBER OUR FRIEND SAUNDRA.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.449
- A PLEASURE.
- HI.

14:09.549 --> 14:11.684
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING
YOU WANTED TO SAY
TO SAUNDRA?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.921
I DO HAVE SOMETHING
I'D LIKE TO SAY.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.957
FIRST OFF, I WANT
TO APOLOGIZE

14:17.057 --> 14:20.793
IF I HURT YOUR FEELINGS
IN ANY WAY

14:20.894 --> 14:23.430
AS A RESULT
OF THE DOG POOPING.

14:23.530 --> 14:24.764
I WAS JUST GOING TO SAY

14:24.864 --> 14:27.700
THAT YOUR ANGER
IS YOUR PROBLEM

14:27.800 --> 14:29.569
AND IT'S NOT
MY PROBLEM ANYMORE.

14:29.669 --> 14:32.072
- HUH, INTERESTING.
- OKAY, BUT IT REALLY WAS GREAT

14:32.172 --> 14:35.909
THAT LARRY ACKNOWLEDGED
YOUR FEELINGS AND APOLOGIZED.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.812
- I GUESS, YEAH.
- HMM, SHE DOESN'T SEEM
TO BE TOO OVERWHELMED BY IT.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.281
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:41.381 --> 14:44.851
I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT
THAT INTERACTION AND--

14:44.952 --> 14:48.188
IT'S JUST THAT DOGS
DON'T REALLY HAVE CONTROL
OF WHEN THEY GO.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.423
YEAH, BUT THE OWNER
HAS CONTROL OF WHERE
THE DOG GOES.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.792
- RIGHT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
- DO YOU WANT TO APOLOGIZE
TO MY DOG?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.361
BECAUSE YOU REALLY
YELLED AT MY DOG.

14:54.461 --> 14:56.930
YEAH, IT'S VERY HARD
TO APOLOGIZE TO A DOG

14:57.030 --> 14:59.032
BECAUSE THEY'RE
A STUPID ANIMAL.

14:59.132 --> 15:00.733
YOU KNOW,
OKAY, AGAIN--

15:00.833 --> 15:03.170
WE'RE GOING TO MOVE
ON DOWN THE COUCH.

15:03.270 --> 15:06.606
AND I THINK YOU MAY
ALSO REMEMBER KAREN.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.108
Larry: KAREN!

15:08.208 --> 15:10.643
I WOULD JUST LIKE
TO APOLOGIZE TO YOU AS WELL

15:10.743 --> 15:13.846
IF I MADE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE
IN ANY WAY AT THE MARKET...

15:13.947 --> 15:15.715
YOU DID.
IT'S OKAY.

15:15.815 --> 15:19.352
- WOW.
- ...WHEN YOU WERE BAWLING
IN FRONT OF THE REFRIGERATOR.

15:19.452 --> 15:22.455
I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH CRYING
IN A GROCERY STORE.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.791
- I WAS VERY UPSET.
- I KNOW, I SEE.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.894
I WOULD SUGGEST, HOWEVER,
THAT THE NEXT TIME

15:27.995 --> 15:29.929
YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED
BY SOMETHING

15:30.030 --> 15:31.598
TO GO TO A DIFFERENT
SECTION,

15:31.698 --> 15:34.934
A SECTION THAT'S NOT USED
AS MUCH AS THE ICE CREAM

15:35.035 --> 15:36.569
WHICH GETS
A LOT OF ACTION.

15:36.669 --> 15:39.206
I WOULD GO MAYBE TO THE--
WHERE THE JAPANESE FOOD IS.

15:39.306 --> 15:40.873
THE HOISIN SAUCE
I DON'T THINK IS A BIG--

15:40.974 --> 15:42.675
IT'S NOT LIKE
BUYING ICE CREAM.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.012
- IT'S A DIFFERENT--
- Margaret: AGAIN,
I AM GOING TO SAY

15:45.112 --> 15:46.446
WE'RE GOING TO CONCENTRATE

15:46.546 --> 15:48.848
ON THE POSITIVE PART
OF WHAT YOU HAD TO SAY.

15:48.948 --> 15:50.650
- SO--
- WHO'S THAT ONE?

15:50.750 --> 15:52.785
- THAT IS DALE.
SHE'S ONE OF OUR MEMBERS.
- DALE?

15:52.885 --> 15:54.454
- YES.
- WOW.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.156
WHY DON'T YOU FINISH
WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
TO KAREN?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.125
WHAT A BOVINE
SHE IS, HUH?

15:58.225 --> 15:59.993
- JESUS.
- WELL, OKAY, SO--

16:00.093 --> 16:01.761
SHE'S LIKE
THE CAPO HERE, HUH?

16:01.861 --> 16:03.496
NO. NO,
SHE'S NOT, LARRY.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.232
DOES SHE RUN THE SHOW?
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

16:05.332 --> 16:08.435
NO, SHE DOESN'T.
NOBODY RUNS THE SHOW.

16:08.535 --> 16:12.005
IS THIS THE INSPIRATIONAL
SPEAKER THAT WE'RE GETTING?

16:12.105 --> 16:14.274
NO, THAT'S NEXT WEEK.

16:14.374 --> 16:17.177
THIS IS OUR FRIEND
AND NEIGHBOR LARRY.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.979
OH MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

16:20.080 --> 16:22.515
WE ARE AGAIN GOING TO STAY
IN THE PRESENT MOMENT,

16:22.615 --> 16:24.851
- BEING GRATEFUL AND BEING...
- INSPIRATIONAL SPEAKER?

16:24.951 --> 16:27.120
- ...HAPPY.
- WHAT IN THE FUCK
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

16:27.220 --> 16:29.022
WE HAVE SOMEBODY
COMING IN NEXT WEEK.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.025
AND I THINK
SHE JUST GOT CONFUSED.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.826
- BUT INSTEAD--
- YEAH, I COULD SEE THAT.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.429
- Margaret: UM, NOW--
- THE WASHING MACHINE'S FUCKED.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.997
THANK YOU, DALE.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.667
THAT DARN WASHING MACHINE.
I'LL TELL YOU, WE--

16:40.767 --> 16:44.071
WE USE IT SO MUCH,
AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
WITH ALL OF OUR MEMBERS.

16:44.171 --> 16:46.273
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT
I'LL DO FOR YOU.

16:46.373 --> 16:48.508
IF YOU NEED A MACHINE,
YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME

16:48.608 --> 16:50.710
AND USE MY MACHINE
ANYTIME YOU WANT.

16:50.810 --> 16:52.179
- OH MY GOODNESS.
- HOW ABOUT THAT?

16:52.279 --> 16:54.447
- WOW. OH, IS THAT GENEROUS.
- HUH HUH?

16:54.547 --> 16:56.849
- THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
- ISN'T THAT A BEAUTIFUL
GESTURE?

16:56.949 --> 16:59.652
- THAT IS GREAT.
- GIVE ME A LITTLE ROUND
OF APPLAUSE IF YOU WANT TO.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.288
IT WON'T KILL YOU.
GO AHEAD.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.323
Margaret:
THAT WOULD BE FINE.
SURE. WHY NOT?

17:03.423 --> 17:05.725
- YOU DESERVE THAT.
- THAT'S KIND OF TEPID.

17:05.825 --> 17:09.062
- ANYWAY, THANK YOU.
THAT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.331
HOW ABOUT THE MARM HERE, HUH?
HOW ABOUT THIS MARM?

17:11.431 --> 17:13.133
OKAY, WELL--
THAT'S ALL RIGHT, LARRY.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.934
- HOW ABOUT THIS MARM?
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.770
- Margaret: I THINK THAT
I'M JUST GONNA SAY GOODBYE.
- OKAY.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.507
IF YOU TOUCH IT
IT'S YOURS.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.775
( laughing )
AGAIN, THANK YOU, LARRY.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.777
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.147
LADIES, I'M JUST GOING
TO WALK OUR GUEST
TO THE DOOR.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.716
- MM, KRISPY KREME?
- OH YEAH YEAH.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.551
AND THANK YOU
SO MUCH. OKAY.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.786
- THIS FUCKIN' THING
IS UNBELIEVABLE!
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.755
LARRY, THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR COMING BY.

17:35.855 --> 17:38.325
COULDN'T BE HAPPIER.

17:38.425 --> 17:40.793
DID YOU PUT ONE OF THESE
DISGUSTING THINGS

17:40.893 --> 17:42.095
BACK IN HERE
AFTER EATING IT?

17:42.195 --> 17:43.696
I MIGHT HAVE.
I HAVE BAD MANNERS.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.166
THERE'S A WHOLE
SIDE DISH HERE
FOR THE REMNANTS.

17:46.266 --> 17:48.568
- THIS IS THE REMNANT PLATE.
- HELLO, BOYS.

17:48.668 --> 17:49.836
- HI, BEAUTIFUL.
- HI.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.371
- OH!
- OH HI.

17:51.471 --> 17:53.473
- HELLO, GORGEOUS.
- I AM SO HAPPY.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.007
I JUST CAME
FROM THE DOCTOR

17:55.108 --> 17:56.776
AND THE MOLE
IS ABSOLUTELY FINE.

17:56.876 --> 17:59.078
- FANTASTIC!
YOU SEE THAT?
- Stella: I KNOW, I KNOW.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.813
- I KNEW.
- THAT'S GOOD.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.949
- BELIEVE ME, I KNEW ALL ALONG.
- I WAS SO WORRIED FOR A WHILE.

18:03.049 --> 18:04.417
I'M VERY HAPPY FOR YOU.

18:04.517 --> 18:06.453
ALTHOUGH IF YOU TOLD ME
THAT IT WASN'T FINE,

18:06.553 --> 18:08.521
I STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE SAID,

18:08.621 --> 18:10.990
"SEE? GOOD THING I TOLD YOU
TO GO TO THE DOCTOR."

18:11.090 --> 18:13.660
AND SOMETHING HAPPENED
WHEN I SAW THE DOCTOR.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.095
I STARTED TALKING
ABOUT HOW MUCH PAIN

18:16.196 --> 18:18.731
I'M ALWAYS IN
WITH MY BOOBS...

18:18.831 --> 18:21.268
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN PAIN?
- ...AND THAT I GET
THESE BACKACHES.

18:21.368 --> 18:24.271
AND I'VE DECIDED
THAT I--

18:24.371 --> 18:27.974
I'M GOING TO GET
MY BREASTS REDUCED.

18:28.074 --> 18:31.378
- YOU'RE GOING TO WHAT?
- I'M GOING TO GET
THEM REDUCED.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.347
- THAT'S--
- ( laughing ) WHAT?

18:34.447 --> 18:36.082
- SHE'S HILARIOUS.
- THAT'S FUNNY.

18:36.183 --> 18:37.517
- THAT'S FUNNY.
- Stella: NO.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.953
- THAT'S A GOOD JOKE.
- I'M SERIOUS. YEAH.

18:41.053 --> 18:42.422
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:42.522 --> 18:43.956
I GET BACKACHES
ALL THE TIME.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.159
IT'S REALLY REALLY
PAINFUL.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.627
YOU TAKE AN ADVIL
FOR THAT STUFF.

18:47.727 --> 18:49.662
YOU THROW A COUPLE OF STONES
BEHIND YOUR BRASSIERE.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.264
- YOU JUST EVEN IT OUT.
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

18:51.364 --> 18:52.599
- OH MY GOD.
- LIKE A SEESAW.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.401
OKAY, BOYS, YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

18:54.501 --> 18:57.136
IMAGINE YOU HAD
HUGE BALLS.

18:57.237 --> 18:58.638
- YEAH?
- BALLS?

18:58.738 --> 19:01.140
ENORMOUS, SWEATY,
JUST FILLED WITH SPUNK--

19:01.241 --> 19:03.075
YOU'RE COMPARING
BREASTS WITH BALLS?

19:03.176 --> 19:05.612
PEOPLE HATE BALLS.
BALLS ARE REVILED.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.648
YOU CAN'T EVEN MENTION
BALLS AND BREASTS IN
THE SAME BREATH.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.351
- OF COURSE YOU CAN.
BALLS ARE MALE BOOBS.
- WHAT?

19:11.451 --> 19:13.320
BALLS ARE DISGUSTING.
THEY'RE HIDEOUS.

19:13.420 --> 19:16.256
EVERYBODY WANTS TO SEE THOSE.
WHO WANTS TO SEE BALLS?

19:16.356 --> 19:17.290
- RIGHT.
- PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THOSE.

19:17.390 --> 19:18.858
- SORRY.
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.361
WOW, I AM TALKING
TO TWO SCHOOLBOYS
RIGHT NOW.

19:21.461 --> 19:23.563
- HOW MUCH ARE YOU PLANNING
ON TAKING OFF?
- MAYBE HALF.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.832
- HALF? DID YOU SAY HALF?
- I'LL BE ABLE TO GO JOGGING.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.734
- HALF?
- HALF, YEAH.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.069
YOU DON'T JUST LOVE ME
FOR MY TITS, DO YOU?

19:30.169 --> 19:33.706
( stuttering )
LARRY, PLEASE, DO I HAVE
TO DEFEND MYSELF IN THIS?

19:33.806 --> 19:36.576
HOLD IT, HOLD IT.
THERE'S MANY THINGS
YOU CAN SAY ABOUT THIS GUY.

19:36.676 --> 19:37.977
- BUT NOT THAT.
- NOT THAT.

19:38.077 --> 19:39.346
- THANK YOU.
- RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT.

19:39.446 --> 19:42.181
HOW COULD YOU EVEN SUGGEST
THAT I WOULD THINK THAT?

19:42.282 --> 19:45.084
LOOK, YOU HURT THE MAN.
YOU HURT THE MAN.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.753
LOOK AT HIM.
IT'S INSULTING.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.322
- AS HIS FRIEND I'M INSULTED.
- OKAY, SORRY.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.157
- I JUST, YOU KNOW--
- LISTEN, WE'LL DISCUSS THIS.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.527
I'M THERE FOR YOU,
REGARDLESS OF WHAT YOU HAVE
TO DO, BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.629
- EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE.
- I'M SO HAPPY YOU'RE
SO SUPPORTIVE!

19:56.729 --> 19:58.565
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.
I'M JUST GOING TO
THE LOO, OKAY?

19:58.665 --> 20:00.967
- BACK IN A SEC.
- YOU'RE THE WOMAN
OF MY DREAMS,

20:01.067 --> 20:02.902
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.371
- YOU FUCKING IDIOT.
- WHAT?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.439
YOU DID THIS.
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.475
YOU LOOKED AT HER MOLE
WITH A GODDAMN TELESCOPE

20:08.575 --> 20:10.977
LIKE GALILEO JERKING OFF
FROM 40' AWAY.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.512
I HAD BREAST VISION,
I TOLD YOU.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.547
BECAUSE OF YOU I'M GOING
TO LOSE THIS BEAUTIFUL WOMAN

20:14.647 --> 20:16.649
WITH THAT FIGURE,
WITH THOSE BOOBS.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.419
- I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT HER BREASTS.
- ALL RIGHT, I LIED.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.821
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?
GO FROM A DOUBLE D TO A--

20:21.921 --> 20:25.191
- WHAT'S HALF OF DOUBLE D?
- B+? NO, B-.

20:25.292 --> 20:27.460
B-. IT'S CLOSER
TO THE D, YES.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.195
WHAT'S CLOSER TO THE D,
THE MINUS OR THE PLUS?

20:29.296 --> 20:30.530
I DON'T GIVE A SHIT,
QUITE FRANKLY.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.365
THIS IS NOT ALGEBRA.
THIS IS MY LIFE.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.435
- LIFE IS SHORT.
HOW DARE SHE?
- HOW DARE SHE?

20:35.535 --> 20:37.504
YEAH, WHAT GIVES HER THE RIGHT?
IT'S SELF-CENTERED.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.938
- IT REALLY IS.
- IT IS SELFISH.

20:39.038 --> 20:40.473
- ISN'T IT?
- TOTALLY.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.709
Larry:
SHE'S GETTING HALF
OF IT TAKEN OFF.

20:42.809 --> 20:44.043
REDUCE THEM BY HALF.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.212
THERE SHOULDN'T
BE A MOTHERFUCKER
CUTTING TITTIES DOWN.

20:46.313 --> 20:47.880
YOU DON'T FUCKIN' WANNA
REDUCE YOUR TITTIES BY HALF

20:47.980 --> 20:49.582
AND EXPECT A MOTHERFUCKER
TO BE HAPPY WITH THAT SHIT.

20:49.682 --> 20:52.084
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- I DO.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.621
- I DO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.
- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:54.721 --> 20:56.489
WHY DO YOU KEEP ASKING ME THAT?
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

20:56.589 --> 20:57.690
SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE FUCK I'M SAYING.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.258
I KNOW WHAT THE FUCK
YOU'RE SAYING.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.793
I EXPLAIN IT TO YOU
AND YOU DON'T FUCKING GET IT.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.729
I GET IT.
YOU WANT TO GIVE ME
A TEST ON IT?

21:02.829 --> 21:04.263
YOU LIKE FUCKING FULL TITTIES
OR HALF TITTIES?

21:04.364 --> 21:05.932
YOU GOT TWO
HALF TITTIES, RIGHT?

21:06.032 --> 21:07.867
- KNOW NO BETTER.
- ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

21:07.967 --> 21:09.636
WE COULD TALK TILL
WE'RE BLUE IN THE FACE.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.438
I DON'T MEAN THAT
AS A RACIAL THING EITHER.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.340
WOULD I EVER TURN
FUCKING BLUE?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.274
- IT'S AN EXPRESSION.
- WHO TURNS FUCKIN' BLUE?

21:15.375 --> 21:17.577
YOU SAY THAT
TO WHITE PEOPLE TOO.
YOU CAN'T TURN BLUE?

21:17.677 --> 21:20.413
- HELL NO I CAN'T TURN BLUE.
- BLACKS BLUSH. YOU BLUSH?

21:20.513 --> 21:22.382
- BLACKS DON'T FUCKIN' BLUSH.
- YOU NEVER SAW A BLACK BLUSH.

21:22.482 --> 21:24.384
NEVER SEEN A BLACK BLUSH
IN MY FUCKIN' LIFE.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.353
BLACKS DON'T
FUCKIN' BLUSH.

21:28.154 --> 21:30.757
- HEY, LAURA.
- HEY, LARRY.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.292
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
- YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.961
- DID YOU USE THE DOWNEY?
- YES, I DID.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.864
- HI, DALE.
- HEY.

21:41.267 --> 21:43.202
- WOW.
- HUH?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.871
- WHEW.
- DID YOU GET A LOAD
OF THAT ONE?

21:44.971 --> 21:46.573
- YO, SHE'S SOMETHING ELSE, MAN.
- ISN'T SHE?

21:46.673 --> 21:47.707
- WHO COULD FUCK HER UP?
- I KNOW.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.609
ME AND YOU COULDN'T
TAKE THAT BITCH.

21:49.709 --> 21:51.578
SHE MUST HAVE MADE UP
A STORY OR SOMETHING
TO GET IN THERE.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.313
I BET SHE HEARD ABOUT IT
FROM A FRIEND IN THERE.

21:54.414 --> 21:56.916
AND MY GUESS IS
SHE'S LIVING IN SOME DUMP

21:57.016 --> 21:58.418
AND DECIDED TO MOVE OVER.

21:58.518 --> 22:00.319
GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT THE FUCK
THE STORY IS.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.589
I'M GOING TO FIND OUT
RIGHT NOW.

22:03.756 --> 22:05.592
SHIT.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.162
- ( knocks )
- YOOHOO!

22:10.262 --> 22:13.099
- HOW'S THE LAUNDRY
COMING ALONG?
- IT'S COMING ALONG.

22:13.199 --> 22:15.067
- HUH? COMING ALONG?
- YEAH.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.471
- YOU EVER ICE SKATE?
- NO.

22:18.571 --> 22:21.040
MAYBE I'LL TAKE YOU
ICE SKATING SOMETIME.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.810
- THAT'D BE FUN.
- I GUESS.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.813
SO, DALE, IF YOU DON'T
MIND MY SAYING,

22:26.913 --> 22:30.817
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
I WAS JUST WONDERING

22:30.917 --> 22:34.186
HOW YOU KIND OF...

22:34.286 --> 22:36.823
YOU KNOW, WOUND UP
OVER THERE.

22:36.923 --> 22:40.326
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU COULD...

22:40.427 --> 22:41.794
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

22:41.894 --> 22:45.698
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.
- AH, OKAY.

22:46.766 --> 22:49.902
BECAUSE THE THING
ABOUT IT IS THAT

22:50.002 --> 22:53.806
I JUST DON'T SEE ANYBODY
TAKING YOU DOWN.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.675
AHH!

22:55.775 --> 22:57.944
( thuds )

23:00.613 --> 23:02.081
THAT IS SOME SHINER
YOU GOT THERE.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.416
CAN YOU TELL ME
HOW IT HAPPENED?

23:03.516 --> 23:08.488
I WAS HOME AND I WAS
TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

23:08.588 --> 23:13.993
AND... I SAID SOMETHING
I SHOULDN'T HAVE SAID.

23:14.093 --> 23:16.463
SO THIS PERSON STRUCK YOU?

23:16.563 --> 23:20.266
NO. I FELL.

23:20.366 --> 23:22.702
YEAH, I FELL.
I'M CLUMSY.

23:22.802 --> 23:25.505
I'M REALLY CLUMSY.
I TRIP ALL THE TIME.

23:25.605 --> 23:28.407
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I KIND OF--

23:28.508 --> 23:30.309
I DESERVED IT ACTUALLY.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.344
- I WAS WRONG.
- Leon: LARRY.

23:32.445 --> 23:36.449
- EXCUSE ME, WE'RE--
- I NEED SOME MONEY.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.417
YOU NEED MONEY?
I GAVE YOU $40 YESTERDAY.

23:38.518 --> 23:40.286
- WHAT FOR?
- I'M FUCKIN' HUNGRY
WAITING AROUND

23:40.386 --> 23:41.488
ALL THIS FUCKIN' TIME
AND SHIT.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.289
CAN'T YOU SEE
I'M IN PAIN HERE?

23:43.389 --> 23:44.891
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

23:44.991 --> 23:46.593
BUT I'M FUCKIN' HUNGRY
RIGHT NOW.

23:46.693 --> 23:48.561
- WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO GET?
- FUCKIN' FRUIT CHEWS.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.096
FRUIT CHEWS?
YOU KNOW HOW BAD
THOSE ARE FOR YOUR TEETH?

23:50.196 --> 23:51.898
YOU WANT TO SPEND THE WINTER
IN THE DENTIST'S OFFICE?

23:51.998 --> 23:53.633
- PUT THIS SHIT
ON MY FUCKIN' TAB.
- ON YOUR TAB?

23:53.733 --> 23:55.301
- YEAH.
- LIKE YOU'RE GOING
TO PAY ME BACK.

23:55.401 --> 23:57.637
YOU KNOW I GOT YOU.
GIVE ME A FEW DOLLARS.

23:57.737 --> 23:59.672
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE YOU SOME.

23:59.772 --> 24:02.775
- I LOVE YOU, LARRY.
- YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO.

24:02.875 --> 24:05.745
- I'M SORRY, YOU KNOW HIM?
- YEAH, HE LIVES WITH ME.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.880
- YOU LIVE TOGETHER?
- YEAH, WE LIVE TOGETHER.

24:07.980 --> 24:10.049
UH-HUH.

24:10.149 --> 24:11.518
( pounding )

24:13.486 --> 24:15.187
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN
ASK HIM TO MOVE IN.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.589
HE JUST MOVED IN,
DOESN'T PAY ANY RENT

24:16.689 --> 24:18.691
AND HE EATS ALL MY FOOD.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.260
HE KNOWS ALL ABOUT ME.
HE KNOWS MY MOTHER'S
MAIDEN NAME.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.829
I'VE GOT TO GET THIS GUY
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

24:22.929 --> 24:25.898
- IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY.
- MR. DAVID, IS THERE ANYTHING

24:25.998 --> 24:28.568
THAT YOU'D LIKE TO TELL ME
ABOUT THIS ACCIDENT?

24:28.668 --> 24:30.903
THIS IS COMPLETELY
IN CONFIDENCE.

24:31.003 --> 24:34.340
( banging )

24:34.440 --> 24:37.910
- NO, MM-MM.
- ARE YOU SURE?

24:38.010 --> 24:41.047
- YEAH.
- OKAY.

24:49.656 --> 24:52.258
- HELLO?
- Larry. Lewis.

24:52.358 --> 24:53.693
- HEY!
- Hey, how are you doing?

24:53.793 --> 24:55.427
GOOD.
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

24:55.528 --> 24:58.765
STELLA IS GOING THROUGH
WITH THE BREAST REDUCTION
ON FRIDAY.

24:58.865 --> 25:01.701
- OH, I AM SO SORRY.
- So on Thursday

25:01.801 --> 25:05.437
I'M GOING TO THROW MYSELF
AND THOSE BREASTS
A FAREWELL PARTY

25:05.538 --> 25:07.273
LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
IN THEIR LIVES.

25:07.373 --> 25:10.276
- A BREAST BLOWOUT.
- A breast blowout.
Exactly right.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.712
BECAUSE I'M GOING TO
GO TO THE BILTMORE
DOWNTOWN.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.080
I'M GOING TO HAVE
ALL THEIR FAVORITE

25:14.180 --> 25:16.482
FROZEN MARGARITAS
AND PUT FLOWERS THERE.

25:16.583 --> 25:17.717
IT'S LIKE THE LAST TIME
YOU'RE GOING TO SEE THEM,

25:17.817 --> 25:19.652
- LIKE GOING OFF TO WAR.
- Absolutely.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.789
I NEVER WENT TO 'NAM
AND I FEEL LIKE THIS IS
SORT OF LIKE-- IN A WAY

25:22.889 --> 25:24.857
- Sort of
the same thing for me.
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD LUCK.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.993
- I'LL SPEAK TO YOU SOON.
- Okay.

25:33.499 --> 25:35.768
OH MY GOD, SO I ASKED YOU
TO WATCH THIS COMPUTER
FOR TWO MINUTES.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.370
I TOLD YOU TO GIVE IT
TO THE GUY WHEN HE COMES
BACK IN, AND WHAT?

25:38.470 --> 25:40.607
YOU-- YOU--

25:45.544 --> 25:47.046
( snaps fingers )

25:47.146 --> 25:48.948
YOU'RE NOT THE GUY.

25:49.048 --> 25:50.617
ALL RIGHT,
I MADE A MISTAKE.

25:50.717 --> 25:51.918
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SOMEBODY ELSE.

25:52.018 --> 25:53.586
- SORRY.
- WHO DID YOU THINK I WAS?

25:53.686 --> 25:56.789
I THOUGHT YOU WERE THIS GUY
WHO I TOLD TO WATCH

25:56.889 --> 25:59.491
THIS COMPUTER AND...
HE STOLE IT.

25:59.592 --> 26:02.662
OH. SO WAS THIS GUY
BLACK OR WHITE?

26:02.762 --> 26:06.165
PFFT, HAPPENED TO BE BLACK.

26:06.265 --> 26:09.602
SO YOU THINK THAT
ALL BLACK PEOPLE
LOOK ALIKE?

26:10.737 --> 26:15.041
I THINK ALL COMPUTERS
LOOK ALIKE.

26:15.141 --> 26:17.209
( clicks tongue )

26:17.309 --> 26:19.078
HAVE A NICE DAY.

26:20.546 --> 26:21.848
Saundra:
...ONE STATEMENT.

26:21.948 --> 26:23.883
IT'S HARD TO MAKE DECISIONS
IN THE MOMENT.

26:23.983 --> 26:25.685
SO BUY A BUNCH
OF ONE THING

26:25.785 --> 26:27.920
AND THEN WE HAVE
A LOT OF ONE THINGS
TO CHOOSE--

26:28.020 --> 26:30.957
- EXCUSE ME,
I GOTTA GET IN HERE.
- SIR, DON'T EVER TOUCH ME.

26:31.057 --> 26:33.259
SORRY, WE'RE FROM
A BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER.

26:33.359 --> 26:38.264
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU COULD TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF, HONESTLY.

26:38.364 --> 26:40.366
- ( crunches )
- AHH!

26:46.806 --> 26:48.607
- OH MY GOD.
- HEY. I KNOW.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.109
IT'S ME, BOB,
FROM THE RESTAURANT,

26:50.209 --> 26:51.844
- YOUR NEIGHBOR.
- OH MY GOD, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:51.944 --> 26:53.780
YES. I'M SO SORRY.
I HAD TO TAKE OFF.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.514
I KNOW YOU ASKED ME
TO WATCH THE COMPUTER,

26:55.614 --> 26:57.116
BUT NOBODY ELSE
LOOKED TRUSTWORTHY.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.685
I COULDN'T LEAVE IT THERE,
SO I TOOK IT WITH ME

26:58.785 --> 26:59.886
AND I FIGURED
I'D TRACK YOU DOWN.

26:59.986 --> 27:01.854
AND NOW WE CAN FIND
THE RIGHTFUL OWNER.

27:01.954 --> 27:04.056
NOBODY ELSE
LOOKED TRUSTWORTHY.
AND I THOUGHT YOU TOOK IT!

27:04.156 --> 27:06.625
- WELL, I DID,
BUT I'M BRINGING IT BACK.
- YEAH, RIGHT.

27:06.726 --> 27:09.495
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I GOTTA RETURN SOME
LAUNDRY TO SOME NEIGHBORS.

27:09.595 --> 27:11.163
- OKAY.
- YOU GOT TWO MINUTES?

27:11.263 --> 27:13.365
- CAN YOU WAIT
IN THE HOUSE FOR ME?
- YEAH YEAH, SURE.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.737
- MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- OKAY.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.676
( knocking at door )

27:27.379 --> 27:30.549
HI, SIR. WE'RE RESPONDING
TO A DOMESTIC BATTERY CALL.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.719
I DON'T LIVE HERE.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.187
THE OWNER OF THE HOUSE,
HE JUST LEFT.

27:35.287 --> 27:37.489
SIR, YOU MATCH THE DESCRIPTION
OF SOMEBODY WHO'S BEEN REPORTED

27:37.589 --> 27:39.892
- FOR DOMESTIC BATTERY
AT THIS ADDRESS.
- NO NO NO NO NO.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.994
SEE, THE OWNER,
HE JUST WALKED OUT.
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

27:42.094 --> 27:43.730
APPARENTLY YOU'VE BEEN
LIVING HERE WITH MR. DAVID

27:43.830 --> 27:44.964
AND HE'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET RID OF YOU.

27:45.064 --> 27:46.833
IT'S ALL
IN THE DOCTOR'S STATEMENT.

27:46.933 --> 27:49.035
NO NO NO NO NO.
LOOK, WE CAN JUST
TALK TO MR. DAVID.

27:49.135 --> 27:51.237
- HE'LL EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.
- YOU WON'T BE SPEAKING
TO MR. DAVID.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.405
- HE'S BEING MOVED
TO A SAFE HOUSE.
- WHAT?!

27:53.505 --> 27:56.208
- NO NO! I WAS JUST
RETURNING A COMPUTER.
- YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL NOW.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.344
A COMPUTER.
I DON'T LIVE HERE.
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.948
WAIT FOR THE GUY TO COME BACK.
HE'LL TELL-- GOD DAMN IT!

28:09.655 --> 28:12.992
( touch tones beeping )

28:13.092 --> 28:14.693
- ( ringing )
- Hello.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.595
HEY, RICHIE BOY!

28:16.695 --> 28:18.931
How's it going?
Having fun?

28:19.031 --> 28:23.035
( theme music playing )
