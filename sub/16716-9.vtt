WEBVTT

00:04.881 --> 00:06.719
Well, hey, there, sailor.

00:06.744 --> 00:08.036
Where are you dropping anchor?

00:08.061 --> 00:11.132
A group of us are joining the
Fire Island invasion this year.

00:11.157 --> 00:14.129
It's the annual drag
parade from Cherry Grove.

00:14.155 --> 00:16.122
Can I fix you some chow
before the crossing?

00:16.146 --> 00:17.564
No, no, no. Actually,
I've got to hustle.

00:17.589 --> 00:18.934
I'm gonna miss the fairy ferry. Muah!

00:18.959 --> 00:20.402
Okay. Ooh, your moustache tickles.

00:20.427 --> 00:22.405
Nice. I think I can work with that.

00:23.063 --> 00:24.810
- Have fun.
- You too

00:24.835 --> 00:27.720
And don't work too hard. It's summer.

00:29.000 --> 00:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:40.758 --> 00:43.125
We need to finalize the media plan

00:43.150 --> 00:44.967
on the next Annabelle Bancroft book.

00:44.992 --> 00:47.228
Oh, also,
call Jackie Dunn's office and tell them

00:47.253 --> 00:48.910
I need to reschedule lunch on Tuesday.

00:48.935 --> 00:50.852
I can make the jitney
if I leave at 1:00.

00:50.877 --> 00:52.244
Can you pick me up in Bridgehampton

00:52.269 --> 00:53.402
across from Candy Kitchen?

00:53.427 --> 00:54.598
What are you wearing?

00:54.623 --> 00:57.056
It's summer Friday, lady.

00:57.536 --> 01:00.614
Ceci got us a table at Navy Beach,
but I'm not eating.

01:00.639 --> 01:02.436
My God, I can smell her Banana Boat.

01:02.461 --> 01:04.507
Why do they even bother
coming in at all?

01:05.163 --> 01:07.862
See if you can get on Charlesâ€™s
schedule before lunch.

01:07.887 --> 01:09.832
He never signed off on
my September budget.

01:09.857 --> 01:12.124
Oh, he left for Pound Ridge last night.

01:12.149 --> 01:13.635
Of course he did.

01:21.820 --> 01:25.192
Hey, did you finish Colin's book?

01:25.217 --> 01:26.941
I was up half the night
but only got through

01:26.966 --> 01:28.154
the first 700 pages.

01:28.179 --> 01:29.060
And what do you think?

01:29.085 --> 01:30.951
I mean, I know it
could use some editing,

01:30.976 --> 01:33.232
but am I just being blinded by lust?

01:33.257 --> 01:34.860
Because I think it's pretty amazing.

01:34.885 --> 01:37.044
I mean, it's overwritten, but I still...

01:37.069 --> 01:38.349
I couldn't put it down.

01:38.374 --> 01:41.683
I mean, it's like a dystopian
"Bonfire of the Vanities."

01:41.708 --> 01:42.938
Oh, my God.

01:42.963 --> 01:45.017
That's exactly how I would sell it.

01:45.042 --> 01:47.188
I'm just worried about
the conflict of interest.

01:47.213 --> 01:49.169
Like, I don't want people to
think that I'm buying the book

01:49.194 --> 01:51.430
because I'm sleeping with him,
and I don't want to lose the

01:51.455 --> 01:52.333
book because I'm sleeping with him.

01:52.358 --> 01:54.162
Ah, the old Catch-69.

01:54.187 --> 01:55.671
Ohh, what am I gonna I do?

01:55.695 --> 01:58.446
Well, first, you need to own
the fact that you're together.

01:58.471 --> 02:00.762
And then you've got to
get Colin a good agent.

02:00.787 --> 02:02.105
I mean, you may be screwing the guy,

02:02.130 --> 02:03.676
but you don't want to screw him.

02:03.701 --> 02:05.346
I do know just the person.

02:06.578 --> 02:09.632
How dare you call me about
work on a summer Friday?

02:09.657 --> 02:12.448
I wouldn't unless it
was something special.

02:12.473 --> 02:14.541
A have the new writer I
want to talk to you about.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.151
Well, is he hot?

02:16.176 --> 02:18.566
It's all about the jacket photo
for a first-time novelist.

02:18.591 --> 02:20.888
I'm dating him, Redmond,
so what do you think?

02:20.913 --> 02:23.113
Well, if you really
want me to consider him,

02:23.138 --> 02:24.754
bring him to the Gansevoort rooftop.

02:24.779 --> 02:26.114
Half the publishing biz will be there

02:26.139 --> 02:27.504
for cocktails this afternoon.

02:27.529 --> 02:28.628
Oh, we'll be there.

02:28.653 --> 02:29.944
And send me the manuscript.

02:29.969 --> 02:31.258
Ugh.

02:44.026 --> 02:45.559
Why do I need an agent?

02:45.584 --> 02:47.366
I already want to make a
deal for my book with you.

02:47.391 --> 02:48.431
And you will.

02:48.456 --> 02:50.581
But I've got to keep this above board.

02:50.606 --> 02:53.635
And you need a someone on
your side that has integrity,

02:53.660 --> 02:55.064
somebody with a great reputation,

02:55.089 --> 02:56.188
someone that people respect.

02:56.213 --> 02:59.401
Kelsey, sweetheart.

02:59.426 --> 03:01.117
- Really?
- Trust me.

03:01.142 --> 03:04.875
Colin, this is Redmond,
the best book agent in the business.

03:04.900 --> 03:07.944
She flatters me, but she's not wrong.

03:07.970 --> 03:09.203
Nice to meet you, Redmond.

03:09.228 --> 03:10.716
Colin, I'll be honest with you.

03:10.741 --> 03:13.260
If Kelsey hadn't slipped me
your little Bildungsroman,

03:13.285 --> 03:15.090
it never would have made
it out of my slush pile.

03:15.115 --> 03:17.940
But lucky for all of us, she did.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.211
You've put a fun house
mirror up to this city

03:20.236 --> 03:24.457
and our culture that's both
hilarious and depressing,

03:24.481 --> 03:25.994
at least in the chapter I read.

03:26.019 --> 03:27.584
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

03:27.609 --> 03:29.824
Thank the gorgeous editrix
who discovered you.

03:29.849 --> 03:31.974
Thank you, gorgeous editrix.

03:32.115 --> 03:34.773
Wait, does this mean you're
going to represent the book?

03:34.798 --> 03:36.170
Because you already have a buyer.

03:36.196 --> 03:39.367
If you want to talk business,
get in the pool.

03:39.392 --> 03:41.821
Oh, see you in minute.

03:41.846 --> 03:43.384
Um, we didn't bring swimsuits.

03:43.409 --> 03:46.829
No problem. They have
them here. Come on.

03:47.706 --> 03:50.170
Hmm, what looks good?

03:50.195 --> 03:51.511
I'm not sure.

03:51.536 --> 03:54.136
I've never bought a bathing suit
out of a vending machine before,

03:54.161 --> 03:55.827
let alone one that also sells condoms.

03:55.852 --> 03:57.418
- What about that one?
- Seriously?

03:57.442 --> 03:59.256
I've already got some
dental floss in my purse.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.405
Oh, right. How's the, um, situation?

04:02.430 --> 04:04.445
- It's under control.
- Okay.

04:04.470 --> 04:05.553
Colin?

04:05.578 --> 04:07.274
Can't I just swim in my boxers?

04:07.299 --> 04:09.145
My treat.

04:09.170 --> 04:11.692
How about the red one?

04:11.717 --> 04:13.833
Mm, don't do Speedos.

04:14.435 --> 04:17.002
It's amazing the things
you'll do to live your dream.

04:17.027 --> 04:18.005
Right, Liza?

04:18.031 --> 04:20.440
Oh, absolutely.

04:23.556 --> 04:26.051
Okay, I have never felt more
naked in my entire life.

04:26.076 --> 04:27.676
Okay, well, you look amazing.

04:27.701 --> 04:29.267
But whatever you do,
just don't bend over.

04:29.292 --> 04:33.709
Wow, I... I thought
this was a work event.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.597
Oh, we are definitely working it.

04:35.622 --> 04:37.852
- Hey, Kels.
- Hey, Josh.

04:37.876 --> 04:39.359
Oh, this is Colin.

04:39.545 --> 04:41.255
Also working it. Don't judge.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.400
Judging, yeah.

04:42.425 --> 04:44.225
Hey, we've got a deal to close.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.759
- Okay.
- Meet you in the pool.

04:49.546 --> 04:53.689
I mean, when I...
when I see you wearing this,

04:53.714 --> 04:56.180
it just... it just make me want to...

04:56.205 --> 04:57.871
Okay.

04:57.896 --> 05:00.263
All right, we can talk about that later.

05:00.288 --> 05:02.974
Oh, we can, can we?

05:02.999 --> 05:04.614
We can talk.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.453
Vending machine's that way.

05:06.478 --> 05:08.472
Okay.

05:09.563 --> 05:12.716
All right, okay.

05:15.270 --> 05:17.060
Whoo.

05:17.703 --> 05:19.899
Ugh, I hate summer.

05:19.924 --> 05:22.978
Everyone's in the
Hamptons or the Vineyard,

05:23.003 --> 05:24.910
and here I am talking to you.

05:25.582 --> 05:27.722
My entire weekend is like a desert,

05:27.747 --> 05:29.580
except with 90% humidity.

05:29.605 --> 05:30.731
Mm.

05:30.756 --> 05:34.671
Honestly, I just lie around
in bed all weekend reading,

05:34.697 --> 05:36.519
bingeing "Frasier" reruns

05:36.909 --> 05:38.715
until it's time to go
back to work on Monday.

05:38.740 --> 05:39.608
I feel pathetic.

05:39.632 --> 05:41.661
Well,
you could rent a place in the Hamptons.

05:41.686 --> 05:42.960
Have you consider that?

05:42.985 --> 05:44.818
A single woman renting in the Hamptons?

05:44.843 --> 05:47.025
Well, that may be the saddest
thing I've ever heard.

05:47.051 --> 05:49.018
You're alone out of choice, Diana.

05:49.043 --> 05:50.175
Excuse me?

05:50.200 --> 05:52.434
You've filtered so many men.

05:52.459 --> 05:53.925
And you have so many rules.

05:54.036 --> 05:55.402
You mean standards.

05:55.427 --> 05:58.536
No, I mean barriers to intimacy.

05:58.814 --> 06:01.215
Look, we can sit here,
and we can talk and talk and talk,

06:01.240 --> 06:02.773
but the story doesn't change.

06:02.798 --> 06:04.444
And whose fault is that?

06:04.469 --> 06:07.434
Instead of pointing fingers,
why don't we try pointing

06:07.459 --> 06:08.827
in the direction of a solution?

06:08.852 --> 06:09.834
Oh, well, by all means.

06:09.860 --> 06:11.860
Get out there. Take a few swings.

06:11.885 --> 06:14.297
The next attractive man you see,
talk to him.

06:14.322 --> 06:15.522
Ask him out for coffee.

06:15.547 --> 06:17.062
Is this the Freudian approach?

06:17.087 --> 06:19.472
Or did you just see this on
"Millionaire Matchmaker"?

06:19.798 --> 06:21.512
I hear that you're frustrated.

06:21.537 --> 06:24.593
But your frustration has
become your comfort zone.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.668
Okay, think of this as an experiment.

06:26.693 --> 06:28.989
Talk to the next
interesting man you meet

06:29.014 --> 06:30.929
and observe what happens.

06:30.954 --> 06:32.585
Oh.

06:33.673 --> 06:35.138
We'll see.

06:35.163 --> 06:37.713
I'm not letting you off
the hook on this one.

06:38.438 --> 06:40.071
Fine.

06:51.667 --> 06:53.722
Nothing like starting the
weekend after a good cry with

06:53.747 --> 06:55.242
your therapist, am I right?

06:55.267 --> 06:57.589
Actually, I am a therapist.

06:57.615 --> 06:58.962
Marriage and Family.

06:58.987 --> 07:00.390
Office next door.

07:00.415 --> 07:02.381
Oh, well,

07:02.406 --> 07:04.825
I always heard that shrinks
were the crazy ones.

07:04.850 --> 07:07.045
Especially the ones on East 65th Street.

07:07.070 --> 07:09.207
We're in a class of our own.

07:09.653 --> 07:12.141
I hope you're sane enough to
leave the city this weekend.

07:12.166 --> 07:13.699
It's supposed to be almost 100.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.813
Oof, my ex-wife got
the house in Woodstock,

07:16.838 --> 07:19.651
so I've learned to love
summer in the city.

07:19.676 --> 07:21.930
I think it's kind of sexy, actually.

07:21.955 --> 07:23.710
Especially at night.

07:23.904 --> 07:26.140
I like your perspective.

07:26.748 --> 07:28.264
Diana, by the way.

07:28.289 --> 07:29.355
Richard.

07:34.643 --> 07:36.206
Stop me if I'm being too forward,

07:36.231 --> 07:39.586
but would you care to
join me for a coffee?

07:40.051 --> 07:42.464
You're asking me for a coffee?

07:42.489 --> 07:44.129
Are you serious?

07:44.829 --> 07:46.831
I mean, in this heat?

07:47.144 --> 07:49.280
How about a beer?

07:51.564 --> 07:53.514
Sounds perfect.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.366
To my newest client.

07:59.392 --> 08:01.319
- Yay.
- Ow.

08:01.344 --> 08:04.824
Redmond, I'm going to ask Liza
to make the deal on this one.

08:04.849 --> 08:06.162
Seriously?

08:06.187 --> 08:08.998
Yeah, I'm gonna stay out of
it due to extreme prejudice.

08:09.023 --> 08:10.549
Get ready to bend over.

08:10.574 --> 08:11.951
That's what I've keep telling her.

08:11.976 --> 08:13.342
Hey.

08:13.366 --> 08:14.741
Babe.

08:14.766 --> 08:17.554
Emily, get over here and
meet my genius new client.

08:17.580 --> 08:20.255
You ladies know Emily Burns from EW?

08:20.279 --> 08:22.757
Liza, it's me.

08:22.783 --> 08:24.000
Jackie Dunn's old assistant.

08:24.025 --> 08:25.053
I work at EW now.

08:25.078 --> 08:26.513
Emily, that's fantastic.

08:26.538 --> 08:28.854
This is Kelsey Peters.
She runs Millennial Print.

08:28.879 --> 08:30.797
- Hey.
- Oh, my God, respect.

08:30.822 --> 08:32.821
I have heard such great
things about your imprint.

08:32.846 --> 08:33.839
Oh, thank you.

08:33.863 --> 08:36.038
Also, I heard about what
happened to your fiancé.

08:36.063 --> 08:38.027
You must have been crushed.

08:38.378 --> 08:40.488
I apologize. Terrible choice of words.

08:40.513 --> 08:43.020
Wow, Emily, meet Colin McNichol,

08:43.046 --> 08:45.264
Kelsey's hottest new author.

08:45.289 --> 08:47.158
And his book's not bad either.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.273
EW should totally do
something about Millennial.

08:50.298 --> 08:51.903
You guys should come
to the office Monday

08:51.928 --> 08:53.109
and meet my boss, Jess Cagle.

08:53.134 --> 08:55.201
- Absolutely.
- Oh, we'd love to.

08:55.226 --> 08:56.366
Liza, I'll email you.

08:56.392 --> 08:58.256
Are you still
Dianatroutassistant@empirical?

08:58.281 --> 09:01.366
- Yeah.
- Oh, and Lmiller@millennial.

09:01.391 --> 09:03.278
Awesome.

09:03.746 --> 09:05.555
- EW.
- Oh, my God.

09:05.580 --> 09:07.215
Ahh.

09:07.502 --> 09:08.868
Kiss each other.

09:08.893 --> 09:10.036
What?

09:16.186 --> 09:19.454
I've prepared Millennial's
offer for Colin's book.

09:19.479 --> 09:21.446
You want to take a look
before I send it to Redmond?

09:21.471 --> 09:22.570
Yes.

09:22.595 --> 09:25.496
We're offering a $75,000 advance

09:25.521 --> 09:28.355
with a standard royalty rate,
plus bonuses if the book hits

09:28.380 --> 09:30.446
"The New York Times"
best seller list or earns out

09:30.471 --> 09:32.152
its advance within a
year of publication.

09:32.177 --> 09:34.231
It's all pretty great
for a first-time writer

09:34.256 --> 09:36.921
but nothing that crosses the line.

09:37.196 --> 09:38.729
Perfect.

09:38.754 --> 09:40.734
Thank you for looking out for me.

09:40.759 --> 09:41.723
Always.

09:41.748 --> 09:44.085
Hey do you think that you can
slip away for that EW meeting?

09:44.111 --> 09:45.955
Yeah, Diana's seeing her therapist.

09:45.980 --> 09:47.065
I have 50 minutes.

09:52.032 --> 09:55.172
Hi, Kelsey Peters and Liza
Miller from Millennial.

09:55.197 --> 09:57.364
We have an appointment with Jess Cagle.

09:57.488 --> 10:00.653
- Hey, what's up?
- I slipped the manuscript to a

10:00.678 --> 10:02.155
producer friend of mine at Paramount.

10:02.180 --> 10:04.271
And he thinks it's
perfect for Scott Rudin.

10:04.296 --> 10:05.829
How fast can you get me your offer?

10:05.854 --> 10:07.284
Liza can send it over now.

10:07.308 --> 10:08.289
Okay.

10:08.314 --> 10:11.528
We are just at EW about
to meet with Jess Cagle.

10:11.553 --> 10:13.986
Go, girl, and tell Jess I'm available

10:14.011 --> 10:15.717
if He needs a date for the Oscars.

10:15.742 --> 10:17.948
Hi guys.

10:17.973 --> 10:19.690
Jess will see you now.

10:19.715 --> 10:22.323
- Thanks.
- Okay.

10:23.255 --> 10:26.167
We are a baby imprint,
less than year old,

10:26.192 --> 10:27.341
targeting millennials.

10:27.366 --> 10:28.951
That's why they're called Millennial.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.839
But the main story is that
Kelsey is the youngest woman

10:31.864 --> 10:34.403
in the business to be
running her own imprint.

10:34.428 --> 10:36.595
- That's interesting.
- Really interesting.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.156
- Really interesting.
- Any big books coming out?

10:39.181 --> 10:42.429
Actually, we just bought a
book from this incredible young

10:42.454 --> 10:44.110
"New Yorker" writer, Colin McNichol.

10:44.135 --> 10:47.332
It's this brilliant dystopian
epic about New York.

10:47.357 --> 10:48.968
Cool.

10:49.543 --> 10:53.244
It's, um, like "Bonfire of the Vanities"

10:53.269 --> 10:54.995
meets "The Walking Dead."

10:55.020 --> 10:56.486
Are there zombies?

10:56.510 --> 10:59.471
Yes. And they occupy Wall Street.

10:59.497 --> 11:03.133
I shouldn't say anything else,
but Scott Rudin loves it,

11:03.158 --> 11:05.891
and Paramount's already
talking a three-picture deal.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.163
Send us the manuscript.

11:07.188 --> 11:10.189
Maybe we can do something online
about the book and Millennial.

11:10.214 --> 11:12.020
- We really should.
- Wonderful.

11:12.045 --> 11:14.844
Get the press kit and bios and galleys,

11:14.869 --> 11:16.435
and we'll see what we can do.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.324
Thank you. It was so nice to meet you.

11:18.349 --> 11:19.892
Thank you so much.

11:20.253 --> 11:22.357
Oh, my God.

11:22.884 --> 11:25.342
Zombies? A three-picture deal?

11:25.367 --> 11:26.919
I don't... I know I just blurted it out.

11:26.944 --> 11:28.824
It's like a got EW-titis or something.

11:28.849 --> 11:31.428
Well, sometimes you need to
stretch the truth a little

11:31.453 --> 11:33.403
to get what you want.

11:36.934 --> 11:39.928
So I took your advice,

11:39.953 --> 11:43.688
left the office,
and struck up a conversation

11:43.713 --> 11:44.927
with an attractive man.

11:44.952 --> 11:47.295
Wonderful. Wonderful. How did it go?

11:47.319 --> 11:49.097
Surprisingly well.

11:49.997 --> 11:53.672
We went out for drinks,
and he introduced me

11:53.697 --> 11:55.167
to the Moscow Mule.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.183
It's a delightful cocktail.

11:57.207 --> 11:59.159
Sounds like you had a nice time.

11:59.185 --> 12:00.484
Yes, I did.

12:00.509 --> 12:02.042
I think you may actually know him.

12:02.067 --> 12:02.852
Do I?

12:02.877 --> 12:04.584
Yes, it's Richard Caldwell,

12:04.608 --> 12:06.359
the therapist in the office next door.

12:06.496 --> 12:08.870
You went out for a
drink with Dr. Caldwell?

12:09.516 --> 12:11.989
I... I find that very inappropriate.

12:12.014 --> 12:13.430
Oh, you may not know.

12:13.455 --> 12:15.721
He's recently separated
from his wife, so...

12:15.746 --> 12:17.707
Oh, yeah, I know. She threw him out.

12:19.695 --> 12:21.516
Excuse me.

12:22.601 --> 12:25.198
Uh, yeah, all right.

12:30.924 --> 12:33.382
Excuse me, I'm in session.

12:33.407 --> 12:35.443
How dare you proposition
one of my patients

12:35.468 --> 12:36.654
right outside of my office.

12:36.679 --> 12:38.762
I should file an ethics
complaint with the APA.

12:38.787 --> 12:41.197
I'm amazed you still
have a license at all

12:41.222 --> 12:43.405
considering you were
arrested for shoplifting.

12:43.431 --> 12:44.767
You sleep here. In your office.

12:44.792 --> 12:45.640
Only temporarily.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.168
You wash your hair in the sink.

12:47.193 --> 12:48.801
- It's appalling.
- At least I have hair.

12:48.826 --> 12:50.607
Men, men, don't fight.

12:50.632 --> 12:52.465
Okay, that's it. That's it.
I'm telling management.

12:52.490 --> 12:54.290
You can't sleep in your office;
you're violating the

12:54.315 --> 12:55.346
terms of your lease.

12:55.371 --> 12:57.096
Paul, there's nothing more pathetic

12:57.121 --> 12:58.396
than an adult tattletale.

12:58.421 --> 13:01.133
No, what's pathetic is picking
up a needy, vulnerable patient

13:01.158 --> 13:02.197
outside my office.

13:02.222 --> 13:05.673
To be fair, I did engage him
in conversation on your advice.

13:05.698 --> 13:08.065
Diana, you have self-esteem
and body image issues.

13:08.090 --> 13:09.470
None of this is your fault.

13:09.495 --> 13:11.495
However, if you continue to see Richard,

13:11.520 --> 13:13.520
our therapeutic relationship is over.

13:15.104 --> 13:16.858
I understand.

13:27.239 --> 13:29.905
I wasn't making much
progress with him anyways.

13:37.180 --> 13:38.601
I'm worried about Kelsey.

13:38.626 --> 13:40.601
You know, she's going a little
off the rails for this guy.

13:40.626 --> 13:42.328
I mean, the way she's hyping him...

13:42.617 --> 13:45.021
Hey, a little hype never hurts.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.477
Honestly,
I'm not sure the book's that great.

13:47.502 --> 13:49.802
I mean, the characters are relatable,

13:49.827 --> 13:52.800
but the writing is all over the place.

13:52.826 --> 13:55.835
That feels so good.

13:56.000 --> 13:58.461
You're so slippery.

13:58.486 --> 14:00.690
I'm slippery.

14:01.176 --> 14:04.344
You know, I could just
slip it in right now.

14:04.369 --> 14:06.517
Just keep doing what you're doing.

14:06.543 --> 14:08.657
Don't knock it till you try it.

14:08.682 --> 14:13.650
You know, it can be
mind-blowing for both of us.

14:13.675 --> 14:15.329
Actually, you know
what? I have tried it.

14:15.353 --> 14:16.518
- What?
- With my ex-husband.

14:16.543 --> 14:18.368
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

14:18.393 --> 14:20.509
You know,
when you've been married long enough,

14:20.534 --> 14:22.606
you try everything out of pure boredom.

14:22.631 --> 14:24.030
Do you know what I'm talking about here?

14:24.055 --> 14:26.860
Josh,
your generation didn't invent anal sex.

14:26.884 --> 14:28.837
You just invented talking
about it all the time.

14:28.863 --> 14:31.326
- Forget it.
- Oh, sorry.

14:31.351 --> 14:32.973
It's just not my thing.

14:32.998 --> 14:34.430
Is it really that big of a deal?

14:34.455 --> 14:39.879
No, I... I just feel
like I can't compete

14:39.904 --> 14:41.812
with all the years you were married.

14:42.396 --> 14:46.349
You know, nothing we do is
ever gonna be new for you.

14:46.374 --> 14:47.895
That's not true.

14:47.920 --> 14:49.196
Come on.

14:49.221 --> 14:51.171
I think it is.

14:51.910 --> 14:55.355
I'm never gonna be your
first time for anything.

15:09.819 --> 15:11.052
Good morning.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.409
Coffee's ready.

15:12.434 --> 15:14.182
Scrambled okay?

15:14.207 --> 15:16.952
Yes, that would be nice.

15:18.450 --> 15:20.854
I can't believe I slept so late,

15:21.180 --> 15:24.325
but then I remembered that
we had quite a workout.

15:24.350 --> 15:26.250
Yes, we did.

15:26.642 --> 15:30.197
So I just heard from the
landlord of my building.

15:30.780 --> 15:33.948
- They're evicting me.
- What?

15:34.245 --> 15:36.935
Yes, that passive-aggressive prick

15:36.960 --> 15:39.481
also known as your therapist
blew the whistle on me

15:39.506 --> 15:41.053
about sleeping in my office.

15:41.078 --> 15:43.833
Richard, I'm so sorry.
I feel so responsible.

15:43.858 --> 15:45.896
You have absolutely zero culpability.

15:45.921 --> 15:48.214
- These were my choices.
- Thank you.

15:48.240 --> 15:51.216
I was wondering though if you
wouldn't mind if I stayed here

15:51.241 --> 15:55.327
for a few days,
just until I find another place.

15:55.675 --> 15:59.910
Uh, well, I don't know.

15:59.935 --> 16:02.165
We just met, so...

16:02.203 --> 16:04.129
I completely understand.

16:04.154 --> 16:05.873
I'll be out of your hair this morning.

16:05.898 --> 16:07.288
Thank you.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.323
You know what I love
to do over breakfast?

16:10.375 --> 16:14.621
Talk about dreams,
while they're still fresh.

16:14.842 --> 16:16.641
You want me to tell you my dreams?

16:16.666 --> 16:18.714
Indulge me?

16:20.483 --> 16:22.584
All right, let's see.

16:22.609 --> 16:25.553
Oh, I was on a stage

16:25.986 --> 16:29.151
shopping for a couch...
oh, but for my old apartment...

16:29.176 --> 16:32.093
And somehow it was raining.

16:32.575 --> 16:36.418
Oh, oh, and I was also in
the audience watching myself.

16:36.443 --> 16:39.219
Wow, so much to unpack here.

16:39.244 --> 16:41.533
The stage is your consciousness.

16:41.743 --> 16:43.543
And that old soggy couch,

16:43.568 --> 16:46.543
that's your past you
don't want to let go of.

16:48.475 --> 16:49.975
But I do want to let go.

16:54.949 --> 16:58.284
I am happy to stay have
you stay for a few days.

16:58.309 --> 16:59.801
Whatever you want.

17:11.057 --> 17:13.747
_

17:15.788 --> 17:20.909
_

17:22.525 --> 17:25.373
_

17:27.473 --> 17:29.594
Hey, how was your
weekend in Fire Island?

17:29.619 --> 17:33.858
Well, I missed the
ferry to Cherry Grove.

17:33.883 --> 17:36.072
So I had to get off at the Pines.

17:36.097 --> 17:37.430
What a nightmare.

17:37.455 --> 17:38.357
Why?

17:38.382 --> 17:40.766
Well, Cherry Grove is the girls'
side of the island.

17:40.791 --> 17:42.636
The Pines is the boys' side.

17:42.661 --> 17:45.682
Oh, so you got off at the
Pines dressed as a man.

17:45.707 --> 17:47.052
That must have been interesting.

17:47.077 --> 17:48.648
You have no idea.

17:48.673 --> 17:51.415
I had to trek through the
meat rack to get home.

17:51.440 --> 17:53.858
- The meat rack?
- Use your imagination.

17:53.883 --> 17:56.017
Anyway,
this a horny guy started to follow me,

17:56.042 --> 17:57.675
so I had to rip my shirt
off to scare him away.

17:57.700 --> 17:59.657
Oh, yeah, I guess the last
thing anybody wants to see

17:59.682 --> 18:01.159
is a rack in the rack.

18:01.184 --> 18:03.882
So how was your night with Josh?

18:03.907 --> 18:06.518
Well, it started with a massage

18:06.543 --> 18:08.097
and ended with me leaving.

18:08.122 --> 18:09.825
What happened? Did you have a fight?

18:09.850 --> 18:10.932
Yeah.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.469
I mean, on the surface,
it was about sex,

18:12.494 --> 18:15.868
but really it was about Josh
having a hard time with the idea

18:15.893 --> 18:18.160
that I've had this
whole life before him.

18:18.185 --> 18:20.845
Mm, I mean, the sex I can work with,

18:20.870 --> 18:23.781
but the fact that you've had
a life before you met him

18:23.806 --> 18:25.558
is just something that he's
gonna have to deal with.

18:25.583 --> 18:28.292
Yeah, I think I know what I need to do.

18:37.025 --> 18:39.906
Hey, you are not going to believe this,

18:39.931 --> 18:42.763
but EW online just ran
an article on Millennial,

18:42.788 --> 18:46.250
and included a big
excerpt from Colin's book.

18:46.274 --> 18:48.309
Oh, my God. Amazing.

18:48.334 --> 18:50.173
They must have really
loved his book over there.

18:50.198 --> 18:52.553
They write about him like
he's the next big thing.

18:52.578 --> 18:54.612
You trusted your gut on this guy.

18:54.637 --> 18:55.861
I'm proud of you.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.038
Thanks. Can you cover my phone?

18:58.063 --> 18:59.741
I'm gonna go over to
his place to celebrate.

18:59.766 --> 19:01.938
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Okay.

19:01.963 --> 19:03.330
Awesome.

19:14.413 --> 19:15.851
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:15.876 --> 19:17.042
Did you see EW?

19:17.067 --> 19:20.368
I just did.

19:23.834 --> 19:25.502
Congratulations.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.789
Are you sure you still
want to celebrate with me?

19:27.814 --> 19:29.491
What do you mean?

19:29.516 --> 19:31.182
Oh, I guess you haven't
talked to Redmond yet.

19:31.207 --> 19:34.526
No, why?

19:35.198 --> 19:39.104
Random House just offered
me 1.2 million for the book.

19:40.288 --> 19:41.671
Wait. We have a deal.

19:41.695 --> 19:43.562
I just sent it to Redmond yesterday.

19:43.587 --> 19:44.909
I know.

19:44.934 --> 19:46.667
But nothing's been signed yet.

19:46.692 --> 19:49.880
Colin, Millennial
can't match that offer.

19:53.670 --> 19:55.203
Excuse me.

19:55.228 --> 19:57.107
Kels...

20:04.165 --> 20:05.831
What the hell, Redmond?

20:05.856 --> 20:09.182
Kelsey, I was just going to call you.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.567
We had a deal.

20:10.592 --> 20:13.768
No, you made an offer,
and you asked me to be fair.

20:13.793 --> 20:16.529
1.2 million? How did that even happen?

20:16.554 --> 20:19.491
Well, after that EW article hit,
there was a feeding frenzy.

20:19.516 --> 20:22.318
Why did you give them the
book without a signed deal?

20:22.343 --> 20:25.005
You created this monster, Kels.

20:25.030 --> 20:28.152
And as his agent,
it is my fiduciary responsibility

20:28.178 --> 20:29.443
to get him the best deal.

20:29.468 --> 20:30.770
This is not fair.

20:30.795 --> 20:33.444
No it isn't fair. It's business.

20:33.469 --> 20:35.685
Go to Charles and ask
him if he'll go to 1.3.

20:35.710 --> 20:37.677
I won't, and I can't.

20:37.702 --> 20:39.242
You stabbed me in the back.

20:39.267 --> 20:41.046
No, I did my job.

20:41.071 --> 20:43.027
You overshared.

20:50.151 --> 20:52.695
You made this happen for me,
Kels, all right?

20:52.720 --> 20:55.187
I won't take another offer,
no matter what Redmond says.

20:55.212 --> 20:57.331
And I wouldn't be here
at all without you.

20:57.356 --> 21:01.102
No, I'm not going to let
you miss out on this.

21:03.286 --> 21:05.588
I would never hold you back.

21:07.980 --> 21:12.939
Whoa.

21:39.878 --> 21:41.771
Just relax.

21:41.796 --> 21:45.811
Don't fight it. Don't tense up.

21:46.154 --> 21:48.975
You're just gonna feel a little prick.

21:49.596 --> 21:50.840
It's okay.

21:50.865 --> 21:52.140
I've given birth.

21:58.501 --> 22:00.485
Ow, ow, ow, ow. Don't...

22:00.511 --> 22:03.367
Speak now. Are you sure you like it?

22:04.683 --> 22:06.204
I love it.

22:06.239 --> 22:07.682
It's us.

22:07.707 --> 22:09.892
Living in the now.

22:10.763 --> 22:15.526
So when we're together,
it's like time has stopped.
