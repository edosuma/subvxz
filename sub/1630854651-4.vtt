WEBVTT

00:12.458 --> 00:13.500
Stee-rike!

00:14.083 --> 00:17.791
Hey, ump! What kind of call was that,
you turkey-looking motherfu--?

00:17.875 --> 00:19.291
He can't even hear you!

00:19.375 --> 00:20.750
You're right.

00:20.833 --> 00:25.166
Hey, ump! Do you have
actual shit in your eyes, ass-face?!

00:25.250 --> 00:27.000
Why don't you shut up, lady?!

00:27.083 --> 00:29.250
You're lucky I can't afford
seats in the stadium

00:29.333 --> 00:31.625
or you'd be fishing this megaphone
out of your ass!

00:31.708 --> 00:33.541
I think that kid can hear you.

00:33.625 --> 00:35.083
I was talking to the kid.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.875
-Ooh! It's from Stewart.

00:38.958 --> 00:41.708
We're going out tomorrow night.

00:41.791 --> 00:44.750
I've never seen you this excited
about a date.

00:44.833 --> 00:47.666
Yeah, I'm just not used to guys
texting me weird stuff

00:47.750 --> 00:50.541
like "hello" and "how are you?"

00:50.625 --> 00:54.791
<i>Batting next for the Cubs,</i>
<i>number 16, Jason Jurado.</i>

00:54.875 --> 00:58.958
Oh my God. That's our neighbor!
I can't believe we're friends with a Cub!

00:59.041 --> 01:02.458
Well, you aren't really friends with him.
You just met him once.

01:02.541 --> 01:03.541
I'm like HPV.

01:03.625 --> 01:05.916
One time and we're together forever.

01:06.000 --> 01:08.458
By the way, I read that
Jason plays for your team.

01:08.541 --> 01:11.875
I wonder if he's a pitcher
or a catcher, wink, wink.

01:12.458 --> 01:15.458
You don't need to say, "Wink, wink"
when you're actually winking.

01:15.541 --> 01:16.833
Was I winking?

01:16.916 --> 01:18.666
Ugh, I gotta see a doctor.

01:18.750 --> 01:21.000
Well all I'm saying is,
you should try to date him.

01:21.083 --> 01:23.333
I mean, he could get us box seats.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.250
"Box."

01:24.333 --> 01:27.791
I'm not going to date someone
just so you can get seats at a Cubs game.

01:27.875 --> 01:30.958
Also, that's such a simplistic,
heteronormative point of view.

01:31.041 --> 01:33.916
Just because we're both gay
doesn't mean we're compatible.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.458
We can't ever let my aunt know about us.

01:39.541 --> 01:41.291
You don't want her to know you're gay?

01:41.375 --> 01:44.541
No, I don't want her to know
I'm dating a Chicago Cub.

01:54.375 --> 01:57.833
Thanks for glamming me up
for the big date tonight, gals.

01:57.916 --> 02:00.250
Damn! You got some hungry-ass hair.

02:00.333 --> 02:01.875
Just eating all the product.

02:01.958 --> 02:04.625
Oh, 'stache is thick like borscht.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.291
You should see the hair on my a--

02:08.375 --> 02:09.791
Stewart!

02:09.875 --> 02:10.875
Hello, everyone.

02:10.958 --> 02:12.833
What are you doing here?

02:12.916 --> 02:15.500
I just popped in to see
if you have any food allergies

02:15.583 --> 02:17.041
before I plan the menu for tonight.

02:17.125 --> 02:17.958
Ha!

02:18.041 --> 02:21.791
This one never met a layer
of the food pyramid she didn't like.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.916
All right, Gideon,
ease up on the cock-block.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.708
Anyway, what he said.

02:26.791 --> 02:30.291
Perfect. So, I'll see you
when I pick you up tonight at 6:30.

02:30.375 --> 02:31.458
Nice to see you all.

02:31.541 --> 02:32.708
Food allergies?

02:32.791 --> 02:33.708
Those aren't real.

02:33.791 --> 02:35.250
What the hell was that about?

02:35.333 --> 02:40.708
He is making nice gesture, like, uh…
giving you last bite of onion.

02:40.791 --> 02:44.083
Or… holding the door open for you.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.666
You're just not used
to a nice guy like Stewart.

02:46.750 --> 02:49.916
I mean, you dated a dude for a month
who called you Denise.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.625
That was an honest mistake.

02:51.708 --> 02:53.500
Denise was his wife's name.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.291
Oh my God, who is that hottie?

02:57.375 --> 02:59.333
Gideon, check it out!

02:59.416 --> 03:02.208
Did you know you had a model
working for you?

03:02.291 --> 03:04.875
You are neither a model
nor are you working.

03:05.958 --> 03:08.666
Told you! It does what it wants.

03:09.333 --> 03:10.833
And then it dawned on me.

03:10.916 --> 03:13.208
I was actually
giving more than I was getting

03:13.291 --> 03:16.416
and that's when I realized
I needed a new therapist.

03:16.500 --> 03:17.708
What about you?

03:17.791 --> 03:20.291
Well, I've been to a physical therapist,

03:20.375 --> 03:22.583
but we mostly talked about my hamstring.

03:22.666 --> 03:25.666
-I get it, pretty juicy topic.

03:25.750 --> 03:28.291
Hey, you better watch it.
Because I'm feeling wild today!

03:28.375 --> 03:32.541
Here. There's some…
awesome street art I wanted to show you.

03:32.625 --> 03:36.666
Notice the use of shading around
the wiener on Chris Pine's forehead.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.333
You really wanted to show me this?

03:38.416 --> 03:41.625
Okay, look. I pulled you in here
because I saw my aunt.

03:41.708 --> 03:43.416
I don't get what the big deal is.

03:43.500 --> 03:46.000
Everyone thinks their own family is crazy.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.916
My uncle Gary sleeps standing up.
It's chilling.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.416
If my aunt found out
I'm dating a Chicago Cub,

03:51.500 --> 03:53.500
she'd never leave us alone.

03:53.583 --> 03:56.625
And if anyone is going to ruin
my first real relationship,

03:56.708 --> 03:58.916
it's going to be me
and my crippling anxiety.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.666
Ooh, you admit it.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.166
This is a real relationship.

04:02.250 --> 04:03.750
Shut up!

04:03.833 --> 04:07.458
Look, I like you and whatever
comes along with that, I'm fine with.

04:07.541 --> 04:10.416
Now, can we please get out of here?

04:10.500 --> 04:13.083
Yeah, I think that rat over there
is smoking.

04:17.000 --> 04:17.833
Phew!

04:17.916 --> 04:20.875
Who knew there were so many steps
involved in making a baby?

04:20.958 --> 04:24.000
Yeah, with Daniel, all it took
was a six-pack of wine coolers

04:24.083 --> 04:26.125
and David Copperfield
at the United Center.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.250
Oh my God!

04:27.333 --> 04:30.291
Mark, <i>I'm</i> the one who should be scared.

04:30.375 --> 04:32.333
It's going into <i>my</i> body.

04:32.416 --> 04:34.375
Sorry. I'm terrified of needles.

04:34.458 --> 04:37.208
You can take the boy
out of Christian Science…

04:38.208 --> 04:40.458
Let's not worry about the needle
until we have to use it.

04:40.541 --> 04:43.916
You're right, which is… hmm, 11:00 p.m.,

04:44.000 --> 04:46.666
the night before our next
hormone check at the clinic.

04:46.750 --> 04:50.375
In the meantime, we'll focus on
getting our bodies healthy to make a baby.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.125
-Speak of the devil.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.375
You're due for a teste massage.

04:54.458 --> 04:57.208
The doctor said it could help
with your short-tailed sperm.

04:57.291 --> 04:58.166
I'm on it.

04:58.250 --> 05:00.500
Testicles only! No shaft.

05:02.416 --> 05:04.125
Oh, hello, Stewart.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.125
Diane, you-- you-- you look beautiful.

05:06.208 --> 05:08.750
Thank you. You clean up nice too.

05:08.833 --> 05:10.291
I got these for you.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.458
For me?

05:11.541 --> 05:13.541
Nobody's ever bought me flowers.

05:13.625 --> 05:16.500
Except when I faked my own death
to get out of traffic school.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.833
You're a regular
Huckleberry Finn.

05:18.916 --> 05:20.791
That used to be my nickname!

05:20.875 --> 05:23.250
Wait. No, it was Dingleberry Skank.

05:24.250 --> 05:26.875
Anyhoo, what's on tap for tonight?

05:28.916 --> 05:31.541
Stewart, this is amazing!

05:31.625 --> 05:34.833
I've never been on a boat
that hadn't just rescued me.

05:34.916 --> 05:37.333
Yeah, the lake has always been my escape.

05:37.416 --> 05:39.333
I worked hard, lived modestly,

05:39.416 --> 05:42.041
and saved enough to buy myself
this little slice of heaven.

05:42.125 --> 05:46.291
You're telling me that you set aside
a portion of your paycheck every week

05:46.375 --> 05:50.041
and after a period of time,
you had enough money to buy this?

05:50.125 --> 05:51.958
Yeah, it's called savings.

05:52.041 --> 05:53.250
Wow!

05:53.333 --> 05:56.750
So money… is cumulative.

05:56.833 --> 05:58.833
Yes. Yes, it is.

05:58.916 --> 06:02.166
Okay. So today is one of
only two days of the year

06:02.250 --> 06:05.708
that the sun sets directly between
the Sears Tower and the Hancock Building.

06:05.791 --> 06:07.708
And you thought to show it to me?

06:07.791 --> 06:08.625
Ah.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.375
-Cleanup in aisle "my pants."

06:12.791 --> 06:13.750
Here, take a look.

06:13.833 --> 06:15.500
Holy mostaccioli!

06:15.583 --> 06:17.000
I look incredible!

06:17.083 --> 06:20.083
Eat your heart out, Shannon Tweed!

06:22.958 --> 06:25.291
I had a great time tonight.
Would you mind if I--?

06:25.375 --> 06:28.166
You can literally do
anything you want with me.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.166
-Even back there.

06:30.250 --> 06:33.666
Yeah. I… was just gonna
ask if I could kiss you.

06:33.750 --> 06:36.375
Aah! Yeah, bring it in.

06:36.458 --> 06:37.291
Mm.

06:39.583 --> 06:42.125
Um, I really hope
we can do this again sometime.

06:42.625 --> 06:43.833
Good night, Diane.

06:45.083 --> 06:46.875
Eh…

06:50.250 --> 06:52.291
Eh…

06:52.375 --> 06:55.541
Diane! Diane? Hello?

06:55.625 --> 06:57.291
You haven't said a word all morning.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.916
How was the date with Nice Guy Stewart?

06:59.583 --> 07:01.458
It was… great.

07:01.958 --> 07:05.250
We had a lovely time
and he treated me with, eh…

07:05.333 --> 07:06.416
What's the word?

07:06.500 --> 07:07.541
Flea medication?

07:07.625 --> 07:08.875
"Respect."

07:08.958 --> 07:11.833
He treated you with respect, Diane.

07:11.916 --> 07:15.291
He made me feel like I was
the only other person in the world,

07:15.375 --> 07:16.958
but here's the crazy part.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.416
We did not ball. No sex.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.791
And it's not because <i>it</i> doesn't work.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.375
Trust me. That's the first thing I asked.

07:24.458 --> 07:28.208
You know that most people don't have sex
with someone they barely know, right?

07:28.291 --> 07:32.500
Tina, you've been watching too many
of those Hallmark card movies.

07:32.583 --> 07:35.000
But seriously, I'm worried, gals.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.833
Stewart's got me on cloud nine,

07:36.916 --> 07:39.166
but I'm scared I'll mess it up.
What do I do?

07:39.250 --> 07:40.958
Okay, here's the problem, Diane.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.833
Stewart is a normie.

07:42.916 --> 07:43.750
And you?

07:43.833 --> 07:45.375
You is a damn freak.

07:45.458 --> 07:47.291
Only in the sheets.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.000
Well, and in the streets.

07:49.083 --> 07:52.166
You have to show Stewart
that you can operate on his level.

07:52.250 --> 07:56.208
Like, what would you normally text a guy
the morning after you went out?

07:56.291 --> 07:58.166
"My dog just shit out your condom."

07:58.250 --> 08:00.416
-Diane, take your break.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.708
It's funny 'cause she doesn't have a dog.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.375
I can do normal.

08:06.458 --> 08:11.166
Like, right now. I'm just a normal lady,
entering her very normal apartment.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.583
-Whoa!

08:13.666 --> 08:15.458
-Holy Harry Caray's ghost!
-Good Lord!

08:15.541 --> 08:18.791
Daniel! There is a naked Cub in our house!

08:18.875 --> 08:19.750
Aah!

08:21.208 --> 08:22.666
Aunt Diane, wake up.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.625
I had the craziest dream.

08:25.708 --> 08:28.750
I walked in on you
and that new shortstop for the Cubs.

08:28.833 --> 08:30.416
-Hi, Diane.
-Aah!

08:30.500 --> 08:33.041
-Hey, stop fainting.

08:33.625 --> 08:35.250
Jason Jurado!

08:35.333 --> 08:37.208
Long time no see, pal.

08:37.291 --> 08:40.208
Been watching you and I think
we can get your batting average up

08:40.291 --> 08:42.666
-if you just lift your elbow a little.

08:42.750 --> 08:44.375
She's just joking.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.875
Like hell I am!

08:45.958 --> 08:50.583
The only time he's gotten past second base
was a few minutes ago on this couch.

08:50.666 --> 08:53.250
As much as I'd love to continue
this waking nightmare,

08:53.333 --> 08:54.375
Jason has to get going.

08:54.458 --> 08:55.375
I do.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.708
But hey, we're playing St. Louis Friday
if you guys want to come.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.541
You can have my friends and family seats.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.833
-Shit yeah!
-We'll see.

09:02.416 --> 09:04.041
It was great seeing you again.

09:04.541 --> 09:07.291
Daniel, this is fantastic for us!

09:07.375 --> 09:08.958
Friends and family seats.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.708
Ah, why didn't you tell me?!

09:10.791 --> 09:12.708
Because you have zero chill.

09:12.791 --> 09:14.541
And I shudder to think what you'll be like

09:14.625 --> 09:16.666
within spitting distance
of the opposing team.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.833
Spitting on the opposing team
was the old me.

09:19.916 --> 09:21.416
<i>I</i> am a normie now.

09:21.500 --> 09:25.041
I went on a date last night
and <i>didn't</i> have sex…

09:25.125 --> 09:27.500
unlike some people. Wink, wink.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.166
Okay, that's a wrap on the winking.

09:29.250 --> 09:32.250
You really think you could go
to the game and not be crazy?

09:32.333 --> 09:33.708
Scout's honor.

09:34.250 --> 09:35.458
-Ugh!

09:35.541 --> 09:38.458
O.J. tastes like shit without vodka.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.875
-Come on, Cubbies!
-…hot dog!

09:40.958 --> 09:45.375
Friends and family receive unlimited
complimentary food and beverages.

09:45.458 --> 09:48.000
-What can I get you?
-"Unlimited"?

09:48.083 --> 09:50.958
Shit, I'm gonna need a minute.
You guys go ahead.

09:51.041 --> 09:52.250
I'm good for now.

09:52.333 --> 09:55.458
I'll just have a Diet Coke
and I'm feeling wild.

09:55.541 --> 09:57.541
What about a small popcorn too?

09:57.625 --> 10:00.000
Wow! What a <i>normal </i>order.

10:00.083 --> 10:02.708
I will have that as well.

10:04.333 --> 10:05.291
Whoo!

10:05.375 --> 10:07.541
Cubbies!

10:09.083 --> 10:11.291
Hey, lady! Move your big ass!

10:11.375 --> 10:12.666
We can't see the game!

10:12.750 --> 10:14.000
Listen here, you!

10:15.125 --> 10:17.000
Remember, you're normal now.

10:19.833 --> 10:24.041
I apologize if my ample backside
limited your view.

10:24.125 --> 10:29.041
Good luck to you, the Cardinals,
and the great city of St. Louis.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.541
Way to take the high road.

10:30.625 --> 10:34.291
You know what? He should be honored
to get a view of that ample backside.

10:34.375 --> 10:39.791
<i>Batting next for the Cubs,</i>
<i>Number 16, Jason Jurado!</i>

10:40.291 --> 10:42.708
Come on, Jason! You can do this.

10:42.791 --> 10:44.583
Whatever it is you have to do.

10:44.666 --> 10:47.583
Elbow up, Jason! Elbow up!

10:47.666 --> 10:49.583
-Last call for beer!
-Stee-rike!

10:49.666 --> 10:51.708
You want to take this tray
off my hands, lady?

10:51.791 --> 10:56.000
Oh, come on, you think we could finish--
What is that? One, two, three…

10:56.083 --> 10:58.375
-Strike two!
-Nine frosty beers?

10:58.458 --> 11:00.083
Go scratch.

11:00.166 --> 11:01.375
Oh, we'll take them.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.500
Would you like to see my place?

11:08.583 --> 11:12.208
Daniel's out with Jason, so…
we can be as loud as we want.

11:12.291 --> 11:14.458
It sounds… very tempting,

11:14.541 --> 11:17.250
but I wouldn't want to ruin this
by rushing into things.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.625
Anticipation makes it
so much better.

11:19.708 --> 11:22.375
Huh. I've never thought of it like that.

11:22.458 --> 11:26.250
So, it's like when you don't eat all day
and then devour a deep-dish pizza,

11:26.333 --> 11:29.208
couple of char dogs,
a gyro and a full bread bowl.

11:30.208 --> 11:31.208
Exactly.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.833
See you soon, Diane.

11:36.208 --> 11:38.500
Sweet shit, that was hot.

11:40.500 --> 11:43.166
Should we schedule
your next appointment, sweetie?

11:43.250 --> 11:47.541
With your texture and style, I'd recommend
no less than six weeks between cuts.

11:47.625 --> 11:49.208
Sure. That sounds perfect.

11:49.291 --> 11:53.958
Great. I'll pencil you in, and thank you
for being part of the Borough experience.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.291
What?

11:58.375 --> 12:01.166
That interaction was very… normal.

12:01.291 --> 12:05.750
And you did it all without even taking
one of your "union smoke breaks."

12:05.833 --> 12:09.208
And at no point did you put your breasts
on the customer's head and say,

12:09.291 --> 12:12.791
"If you don't like the cut,
you can always wear this hat."

12:12.875 --> 12:13.750
It was easy.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.791
I just fought
every natural instinct I had.

12:16.875 --> 12:20.666
Speaking of, how long is normal
to wait to bone?

12:20.750 --> 12:22.333
Because we haven't even come close.

12:22.416 --> 12:25.083
No 69, no blowies. No fingers--

12:25.166 --> 12:26.875
We all know the sex things.

12:26.958 --> 12:28.875
I don't know if I can keep waiting.

12:28.958 --> 12:31.083
I almost exploded at the Cubs game.

12:31.166 --> 12:33.750
Baseball make you
horny like goat.

12:33.833 --> 12:36.291
You need a less stimulating surrounding.

12:36.375 --> 12:40.208
You know, keep it boring,
like a library or a nursing home.

12:40.291 --> 12:41.958
I've banged in both those places.

12:42.041 --> 12:45.500
What is the lamest, least sexy thing
you can think of?

12:46.000 --> 12:46.833
Do that.

12:46.916 --> 12:49.583
Oh, that's a no-brainer.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.458
<i>Belly dancing circulates</i>
<i>the blood to the ovaries.</i>

12:54.541 --> 12:56.416
<i>So, go ahead and shake it, baby.</i>

12:57.250 --> 12:59.541
<i>But never shake your baby.</i>

13:00.875 --> 13:03.791
I'm having a hard time
with these oysters.

13:03.875 --> 13:06.291
-I struggle with viscous textures.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.000
-Hello?

13:09.083 --> 13:11.125
Bon? Cancel your plans for tonight.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.708
Because you're coming to dinner
with me and my new beau.

13:14.291 --> 13:18.000
I don't know. We're doing a special diet
to keep Mark's testosterone up.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.166
You know what?
It might be nice to get out of the house.

13:23.166 --> 13:24.875
I think I swallowed a pearl!

13:25.958 --> 13:28.208
I'm so proud of you, Jason.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.250
Having your photo hung up
at the Cubby Bear

13:30.333 --> 13:32.250
is a sacred Cubs tradition.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.166
Thank you. Why don't you swing by
when you're done with dinner?

13:35.250 --> 13:37.333
Thanks, but Stewart
and I'll probably rush home

13:37.416 --> 13:39.916
to watch the new episode of <i>Love is Quiet.</i>

13:40.000 --> 13:41.916
You know, just a boring night.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.583
Oh, that reminds me.

13:43.666 --> 13:45.750
Daniel, do you have a blazer I could wear?

13:45.833 --> 13:46.666
Um…

13:46.750 --> 13:49.625
I think my Confirmation suit
is in my closet.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.791
Perfect. Have fun, boys.

13:52.750 --> 13:55.250
I don't usually share clothes
with my aunt.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.083
Okay, I borrowed
a spaghetti strap tank top.

13:58.166 --> 13:59.166
Once.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.875
These male fertility pants are
really letting my boys breathe.

14:02.958 --> 14:03.875
Over here!

14:03.958 --> 14:07.375
Hey, I'm Mark. This is Bonnie.
You must be Stewart.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.083
Pleasure to meet you, Maaark…

14:09.166 --> 14:10.208
Hi, Bonnie.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.458
Hi, Stewart.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.375
Diane, you look nice.

14:13.458 --> 14:14.916
Where'd you get that blazer?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.541
Pretty sharp, right?

14:19.333 --> 14:20.958
Remember, no crossies.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.833
So, Stewart, how did you two meet?

14:23.916 --> 14:26.833
Well, uh, my office is a few doors down
from Diane's salon.

14:26.916 --> 14:28.500
-And one day, I…

14:28.583 --> 14:29.833
Oops. I'm sorry.

14:29.916 --> 14:31.875
I just have to take
my temperature real quick

14:31.958 --> 14:34.083
and jot it down in my fertility log.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.833
I just said "log" and you didn't
make a poop joke. Are you okay?

14:39.916 --> 14:44.333
Bonnie! Let's not talk about <i>feces</i>
at the dinner table.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.666
Sorry, Stewart.

14:46.250 --> 14:48.791
Good evening, folks.
Can I get you started with a drink?

14:48.875 --> 14:50.208
Just sparkling water for us.

14:50.291 --> 14:53.166
Lemon on the side, no seeds if possible.

14:53.250 --> 14:56.250
Ooh, that actually sounds good.
Make it two, please.

14:56.333 --> 15:00.000
I'm okay for now.
I'll wait and order a wine with dinner.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.041
You're not drinking before dinner?

15:02.125 --> 15:04.916
I want to pair my wine with my entrée.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.708
What if I order a red and then get fish?

15:07.791 --> 15:09.500
Ha! Can you imagine?

15:09.583 --> 15:11.666
Oh, yeah. I hate when that happens.

15:13.958 --> 15:17.291
And the omega-threes help
with the motility of the sperm,

15:17.791 --> 15:21.000
which is very different
than the mobility of the sperm.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.125
So, when that's done…

15:22.208 --> 15:24.833
-Wow, this is just fascinating.

15:24.916 --> 15:28.041
Diane, would you mind
showing me where the restroom is?

15:28.125 --> 15:30.541
Sure. I can stand to
visit the ladies' myself.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.166
…one that I didn't like at first…

15:33.708 --> 15:36.041
So, I'll meet you back
at the table in five,

15:36.125 --> 15:38.500
or is this more of a ten-minute situation?

15:38.583 --> 15:41.916
Actually, to be honest, I just wanted
to have a moment with you.

15:42.000 --> 15:42.833
Really?

15:42.916 --> 15:45.541
Diane, your sister and Mark
are really nice,

15:45.625 --> 15:49.791
but they are the most boring people
I've ever met in my entire life.

15:49.875 --> 15:51.375
And I'm a patent lawyer.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.125
Oh my God, I know! Aren't they the worst?

15:54.208 --> 15:56.625
Whoa. Wait. If you think so too,

15:56.708 --> 15:58.708
why did you want us to go
to dinner with them?

15:59.291 --> 16:01.416
Because… they're normal.

16:01.500 --> 16:04.750
And I thought if you met them,
you'd think I was normal too.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.791
So, you did all this to impress me?

16:07.875 --> 16:10.500
Yep. I think I really like you.

16:10.583 --> 16:12.125
You didn't have to do all that.

16:12.208 --> 16:14.000
I really like you, Diane.

16:14.083 --> 16:17.500
And I was hoping tonight after dinner,
we could take this to the next level.

16:17.583 --> 16:19.708
I don't think I can wait any longer.

16:19.791 --> 16:22.416
-You mean…?
-We're banging in that bathroom.

16:22.500 --> 16:23.458
Whoop!

16:26.958 --> 16:29.000
I gotta say, I really like Stewart.

16:29.083 --> 16:30.666
He seems good for Diane.

16:30.750 --> 16:33.083
This is the most adult I've ever seen her.

16:33.166 --> 16:36.291
Toot-toot! Party train coming through!

16:36.375 --> 16:38.166
-Who wants shots?
-Yes!

16:38.250 --> 16:41.416
Hey, sweetie! Grab another pitcher
of Long Island stat!

16:41.500 --> 16:44.958
Heck to the yeah, I've always wanted
to try a naughty iced tea.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.375
And a round of cannolis for the table!

16:47.458 --> 16:50.250
Cannoli? We haven't even eaten dinner yet.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.916
Why wait when you can
just jump to the good part?

16:53.000 --> 16:54.083
Right, Stewart?

16:54.166 --> 16:55.416
Oh, I hear that!

16:57.291 --> 16:59.958
What happened in that bathroom?

17:00.583 --> 17:01.583
Aah!

17:04.000 --> 17:07.500
Oh, yeah! Feels like
goddamn heaven in my mouth!

17:08.375 --> 17:10.125
-Nam!
-Mm!

17:11.208 --> 17:13.958
-Feels good to let go!
-Can I get you anything else?

17:14.041 --> 17:17.625
No, let's bail on this dump
and head over to Cubby Bear.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.375
Daniel's there
with his new Cubs player boyfriend.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.625
-What?
-Yeah, come on!

17:21.708 --> 17:23.791
-We're out of here.
-Maybe we should head home.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.166
It's time to take your shot.

17:25.250 --> 17:29.083
Daniel has a new boyfriend
and Diane knew about it before me?

17:29.166 --> 17:31.166
Screw that!

17:35.208 --> 17:37.291
-A cover charge?
-Sorry, lady.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.666
Eat my ass!

17:38.750 --> 17:41.291
The guest of honor
is my future nephew-in-law.

17:41.375 --> 17:44.708
-Jason! Tell this jag we're VIP!
-Mm! Mm!

17:45.291 --> 17:48.791
You could let her in, or we could
get up and sneak out the back door.

17:48.875 --> 17:49.791
It's fine.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.083
-Hey, she's with me!
-Mm!

17:52.166 --> 17:55.333
There's my boys. How about some shots?

17:55.416 --> 17:58.166
First round is on…

17:58.250 --> 17:59.083
Stewart.

17:59.166 --> 18:02.458
-Come on, Stew.
-Yes! More Long Island iced teas!

18:02.541 --> 18:04.041
-Mom?!
-Move it!

18:04.125 --> 18:05.208
Dad!

18:05.291 --> 18:06.833
Uh, this is Jason.

18:06.916 --> 18:09.375
I'm Mark, aka, the Dad.

18:09.458 --> 18:10.416
Hello!

18:10.500 --> 18:12.291
You mind if I saddle up next to you?

18:12.375 --> 18:13.458
Pleasure to meet you.

18:13.541 --> 18:16.000
Daniel's told me so many great things
about you guys.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.958
And we've heard some good things
about you… from Diane.

18:20.041 --> 18:22.625
Well, the important thing is
you're meeting right now…

18:22.708 --> 18:24.666
in the most awkward and unplanned way.

18:25.791 --> 18:29.916
Whew! Gotta get my heart rate up.
Found out I have a cold uterus.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.666
Oh, wow. That's really--

18:31.750 --> 18:34.416
Mark! It's time for your scrotum massage.

18:35.416 --> 18:36.791
No resty for the teste.

18:40.041 --> 18:42.958
So, Jason. Shortstop, huh?

18:43.041 --> 18:46.291
Dad. I can't even begin to comprehend
what you're doing right now.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.666
Ch-ch! Jell-O shots coming through!

18:48.750 --> 18:50.458
Mark and I aren't drinking.

18:50.541 --> 18:53.583
But we can toast
with our fish oil supplements.

18:53.666 --> 18:56.083
To finally having some fun tonight!

18:56.166 --> 18:57.416
I will drink to that!

18:57.500 --> 18:58.625
Me too.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.541
-Whoop!
-Damn it!

19:02.625 --> 19:04.291
-Ah! The hormone shot!
-Move your foot!

19:04.916 --> 19:06.041
Please excuse us.

19:06.125 --> 19:08.666
-Oh, no, no, no!
-Where is it?

19:08.750 --> 19:10.708
I guess this whole time,

19:10.791 --> 19:13.833
I should have been worried
about my parents instead of my aunt.

19:13.916 --> 19:17.291
By the way, if you ever want
to start juicing, I got a hookup.

19:17.375 --> 19:19.166
JK! They're all crazy.

19:20.166 --> 19:24.833
Okay, party people!
Who's ready to ride the Bear?

19:24.916 --> 19:26.291
You gotta do it!

19:26.375 --> 19:29.416
You can't be a Cub
until you ride the Bear!

19:29.500 --> 19:30.750
No! Diane! He can't.

19:30.833 --> 19:33.125
Daniel! Don't worry about it.

19:33.208 --> 19:34.208
Whoa!

19:34.291 --> 19:36.125
Guest of honor, coming through!

19:37.750 --> 19:38.875
Hold on tight!

19:38.958 --> 19:40.833
Jason, be careful!

19:40.916 --> 19:43.583
-Oh! Look at those muscles.

19:43.666 --> 19:46.000
Shoot, where'd it go?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.000
Wow, that is a big bear.

19:49.083 --> 19:51.958
What the--? I don't think
this was built for two people!

19:52.041 --> 19:53.500
You should probably get off!

19:53.583 --> 19:56.625
Oh, believe me, sweetie, I am!

19:56.708 --> 19:58.250
Bonnie! I found it!

19:58.333 --> 20:01.250
No, seriously, I'm losing my grip!

20:01.333 --> 20:03.625
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God!

20:03.708 --> 20:04.708
Ugh!

20:04.791 --> 20:06.750
Whoa!

20:06.833 --> 20:08.458
I believe you dropped this, milady.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.625
-Whoa!

20:11.541 --> 20:15.291
Oh, no!

20:19.583 --> 20:20.583
Oof!

20:26.916 --> 20:30.541
Jason, again, I am so, so sorry.

20:30.625 --> 20:33.541
That makes me feel
so, so much better.

20:33.625 --> 20:36.375
J-Money, you're gonna love Florida.

20:36.458 --> 20:38.541
I'll hit you up
when I'm in the Panhan-- Oh!

20:38.625 --> 20:41.875
This is all your fault!

20:45.291 --> 20:47.166
See why I didn't want you involved?

20:47.250 --> 20:50.458
He didn't get traded to Tampa Bay
because he got his teeth knocked out,

20:50.541 --> 20:52.958
he got traded because he was batting 185.

20:53.041 --> 20:55.541
I told you to keep your elbow up!

20:55.625 --> 20:56.875
Don't worry. Daniel.

20:56.958 --> 21:00.208
I'm sure you'll meet another
young, gay, gorgeous, professional athlete

21:00.291 --> 21:02.083
who also happens to live on our block.

21:02.166 --> 21:04.708
I am not speaking to you.

21:04.791 --> 21:07.750
Okay, fine.
Chris Pine is the hottest Chris.

21:07.833 --> 21:09.458
No way. It's Hemsworth.

21:09.541 --> 21:11.500
Damn it! Starting now.

21:14.083 --> 21:18.250
Well, well, well. Look who's
finally recovered from our wild night.

21:18.333 --> 21:19.791
Oh, it was a wild night, all right.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.750
You're about to break up with me,
aren't you?

21:22.833 --> 21:25.958
Diane, look, you are an--

21:26.041 --> 21:28.083
No, you don't have to do this, sweetie.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.666
I get it. I'm a wild stallion.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.125
You can grope me, but you can't rope me.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.791
Oh, I know. But when we were
at the Cubby Bear, you were glowing.

21:36.875 --> 21:38.875
That's the Diane the world deserves.

21:38.958 --> 21:41.333
And that's what they're gonna get.

21:42.333 --> 21:45.000
The law office is two doors down
if you ever need me.

21:45.083 --> 21:48.916
Oh, I am for sure coming to you
next time I get arrested for weed.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.166
Weed is legal now.

21:50.250 --> 21:52.666
Not the kind I'm smoking, baby!

21:52.750 --> 21:53.833
Wink, wink.

21:53.916 --> 21:56.208
Ah, I gotta get that looked at.

22:10.458 --> 22:11.791
Poor little leaf.

22:11.875 --> 22:14.375
Oh my Go-- Mark, how are you still crying?

22:14.458 --> 22:16.166
The shot has worn off by now.

22:16.666 --> 22:19.791
I know. I think this is just me.
