-Thank you.

01:12.100 --> 01:14.700
That was... very odd.

01:16.066 --> 01:18.333
If I increase my steroids
by 100 milligrams,

01:18.400 --> 01:21.233
I sing just like Barbara Mandrell.

01:21.300 --> 01:22.834
Would that get me on the show?

01:22.900 --> 01:24.467
No, but if you're ever in prison,

01:24.533 --> 01:26.367
I bet it would get you
everyone's dessert.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.233
The ladies' auxiliary puts me
in charge of the variety show,

01:34.300 --> 01:37.166
and we can't come up
with one decent act.

01:37.233 --> 01:40.066
Too bad this isn't St. Olaf.

01:40.133 --> 01:42.467
There's great talent in St. Olaf?

01:42.533 --> 01:44.667
No. It's lunchtime there.

01:46.266 --> 01:48.734
I could really go for
a smoked kipper hero.

01:50.633 --> 01:53.400
All right!
Who's auditioning next?

01:53.467 --> 01:55.266
I'm next.

01:55.333 --> 01:57.333
Ma, what the hell
are you doing here?

01:57.400 --> 02:02.033
I gnawed through my leather
restraints and outran the guard dog.

02:02.100 --> 02:03.233
I'm here for the audition.

02:03.300 --> 02:04.266
Forget it.

02:04.333 --> 02:08.066
You always force
your way into the show.

02:08.133 --> 02:11.400
You can't sing, dance,
or tell jokes.

02:11.467 --> 02:13.300
I'm sorry,
you can't be in the show.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.600
"You can't be in the show."

02:15.667 --> 02:17.200
Who are you, Ricky Ricardo?

02:20.400 --> 02:22.633
For your information,
I'm not auditioning.

02:22.700 --> 02:23.600
Why are you here?

02:23.667 --> 02:27.734
I know I'm not talented,
so I've become an agent.

02:27.800 --> 02:30.200
Why Ryan O'Neal hasn't come
to the same conclusion,

02:30.266 --> 02:31.834
I'll never understand.

02:33.166 --> 02:35.934
I'm proud to announce
I'm the exclusive,

02:36.000 --> 02:39.533
worldwide representative
of the Donatello triplets!

02:42.500 --> 02:44.800
Hit it, my magnificent
little songbirds.

-So, what do you think?
-They're adorable!

03:23.133 --> 03:24.633
They're perfect!

03:25.934 --> 03:27.633
Take 5. Go wait in the van.

03:29.467 --> 03:32.667
They shouldn't be here
while I'm negotiating.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.533
Negotiating?
Sophia, this show is for charity.

03:35.600 --> 03:39.233
The word charity isn't in a
good agent's vocabulary.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.467
Thanks for your time,

03:41.533 --> 03:45.800
but other talented people here
are willing to do the show for free.

03:45.867 --> 03:47.000
Who's next?

03:47.066 --> 03:49.700
The Sklarkevitch brothers.

03:49.767 --> 03:52.433
Hello, I am Misha Sklarkevitch.

03:52.500 --> 03:56.033
My brother Andre is still in Poland.

03:56.100 --> 03:59.100
Please show us what you can do,
Mr. Sklarkevitch.

03:59.166 --> 04:01.633
It's better with my brother.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.133
Hey!

04:04.000 --> 04:05.266
Hey!

04:05.934 --> 04:07.066
Hey!

04:15.066 --> 04:17.467
It's better with my brother.

04:19.033 --> 04:22.100
If you change your minds,
you know where to find me.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.867
(soft music playing)

04:30.300 --> 04:31.834
Dorothy, I have terrible news.

04:31.900 --> 04:34.000
We don't have an emcee.

04:34.066 --> 04:38.133
Kent Ferguson, the KTMB weatherman,
has just dropped out.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.300
You're kidding. What happened?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.533
He's filling in for Willard Scott.

04:43.600 --> 04:47.967
Willard ate some bad scallops.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.800
He wandered over
to the critics' corner

04:53.867 --> 04:56.333
and lost his cookies
on Gene Shalit.

04:58.133 --> 05:00.500
Gene thought it was
because Willard disagreed

05:00.567 --> 05:03.333
with his review
of <i>The Accidental Tourist.</i>

05:05.467 --> 05:08.633
Willard apologized
and left the studio.

05:08.700 --> 05:11.367
They're saying he's on assignment.

05:11.433 --> 05:13.266
At least some good came of it.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.500
It's about time someone
threw up on Gene Shalit.

05:20.100 --> 05:23.000
Volunteering to organize
this variety show

05:23.066 --> 05:25.367
was the worst idea
we have ever had.

05:25.433 --> 05:27.667
We've hardly sold any tickets,

05:27.734 --> 05:32.333
we can't find an emcee,
and all the acts are awful.

05:32.400 --> 05:35.633
Dorothy, good news.
I've had a change of heart.

05:35.700 --> 05:38.333
The triplets can appear for free.

05:38.400 --> 05:42.200
Honey, you don't know
how much good this does us.

05:42.266 --> 05:43.934
Wait. What's the catch?

05:44.000 --> 05:47.667
That is so typical of you.

05:47.734 --> 05:50.867
Why do you assume,
because I'm doing something nice,

05:50.934 --> 05:51.600
there's a catch?

05:51.667 --> 05:52.800
There isn't a catch?

05:52.867 --> 05:55.166
I didn't say that.

05:55.233 --> 05:58.567
I'm just ticked off you
automatically assume there's one.

05:58.633 --> 06:00.300
What is it you want?

06:00.367 --> 06:03.066
For the moment, only for you to
feast your eyes

06:03.133 --> 06:05.800
on the great Alphonso!

06:06.834 --> 06:09.333
The great Alphonso!

06:10.367 --> 06:11.600
Seymour...

06:11.667 --> 06:15.934
Hello, I'm the great...
I'm the great...

06:16.000 --> 06:17.033
Alphonso.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.166
What?

06:19.233 --> 06:21.300
Pull the damn rabbit
out of your hat.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.867
Right. Right.

06:22.934 --> 06:25.433
Abracadabra, hocus picus--

06:25.500 --> 06:26.433
Pocus.

06:26.500 --> 06:28.934
My God,
where's the damn rabbit?

06:29.000 --> 06:31.367
It's in the other hat.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.400
Sophia, he's terrible.

06:33.467 --> 06:35.867
No, he's not.
He's terrific.

06:35.934 --> 06:38.133
You mean the act?
We'll work on it.

06:40.867 --> 06:43.934
So that's it?
We'll get the Donatello triplets

06:44.033 --> 06:46.467
if we put your new boyfriend
in the show.

06:46.533 --> 06:47.867
That's blackmail.

06:47.934 --> 06:49.867
That's show business.

06:53.066 --> 06:54.400
Hi, girls.
How's everything going?

06:54.467 --> 06:57.033
Awful! Kent Ferguson canceled.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.400
We don't have an
emcee for the show.

06:59.467 --> 07:01.633
We don't have any talent
for the talent show.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.767
It'll be a disaster.

07:03.834 --> 07:08.500
I'll be the laughingstock
of the ladies' auxiliary.

07:08.567 --> 07:11.433
Maybe I'll get Bob Hope
to be our emcee.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.500
How will you get Bob Hope?

07:13.567 --> 07:15.834
Easy. He's my father.

07:24.800 --> 07:29.967
Rose, have you been forgetting
to wash the fruit before you eat it?

07:30.033 --> 07:33.867
I'm serious!
Bob Hope is my father,

07:33.934 --> 07:36.066
well, sort of, he could be, maybe.

07:36.133 --> 07:39.467
Rose, what the hell
are you talking about?

07:39.533 --> 07:41.500
There's something
I've never told you.

07:41.567 --> 07:46.133
I spent my first eight years
at the St. Olaf orphanage.

07:46.200 --> 07:49.367
Gunter and Alma Nylund
are my adoptive parents.

07:49.433 --> 07:51.934
But you never mentioned this before.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.133
I love my parents so much,
I really never think about it.

07:55.200 --> 07:59.533
When I was at the orphanage,

07:59.600 --> 08:01.900
I daydreamed all the time

08:01.967 --> 08:06.166
that my real parents would knock
on the door and take me away.

08:06.233 --> 08:07.533
Like the other kids,

08:07.600 --> 08:11.133
I started fantasizing
about who they might be.

08:11.200 --> 08:15.367
I had a clear picture
in my head of my father.

08:15.433 --> 08:18.467
Anyway, one day
they took us to the movies,

08:18.533 --> 08:21.433
and when Bob Hope
came on the screen,

08:21.500 --> 08:25.500
I stood up and yelled, "My God,
that's my father! That's him!"

08:34.700 --> 08:39.867
Rose, honey, you don't
still actually believe that?

08:39.934 --> 08:43.567
Believing that got me through
some rough times.

08:43.633 --> 08:46.166
Whenever I had a problem
I couldn't solve,

08:46.233 --> 08:49.667
I'd write Bob Hope a letter,
go to his movies,

08:49.734 --> 08:52.633
and suddenly,
I could work it all out.

08:52.700 --> 08:56.667
All my life, I felt he was there
if I needed him.

08:56.734 --> 08:58.934
I know he won't
let me down now.

08:59.000 --> 09:03.133
Should I cry or commit you?

09:03.200 --> 09:04.400
Leave it to me.

09:04.467 --> 09:06.400
I know in my heart
he'll be here.

09:06.467 --> 09:12.200
Just so I get this straight,
you never actually met Bob Hope?

09:12.266 --> 09:15.934
No, but I'm sure
looking forward to it.

09:16.000 --> 09:16.834
Oh!

09:16.900 --> 09:19.900
Boo-hoo-hoo!

09:19.967 --> 09:22.000
No, no, now, Dorothy, no, no.

09:22.066 --> 09:24.233
(mellow music playing)

09:24.300 --> 09:28.433
I'd like to thank those
bake sale participants

09:28.500 --> 09:34.900
who raised money for the religious
cult deprogramming center.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.300
I'm happy to report

09:37.367 --> 09:41.266
that Doris Levy's son Marshall
is now back in law school.

09:44.467 --> 09:46.100
Now it's time for an update

09:46.166 --> 09:50.266
on our biggest and most important
charity fund raiser,

09:50.333 --> 09:53.033
the annual hospital
variety show benefit.

09:53.100 --> 09:57.200
I'd like to call on chairman
Dorothy Zbornak for an update.

09:57.266 --> 09:59.667
Dorothy?

09:59.734 --> 10:01.633
Well, I'm

10:01.700 --> 10:04.233
I'm very happy to report that

10:04.300 --> 10:08.433
this year's variety show
is really coming along.

10:08.500 --> 10:12.166
The first thing I'd like to discuss,
yes, Frieda?

10:12.233 --> 10:15.133
I heard that ticket sales
aren't going well,

10:15.200 --> 10:18.066
I heard you haven't
found any good talent,

10:18.133 --> 10:22.934
and I heard Kent Ferguson canceled,
and we don't have an emcee.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.533
Yeah? I heard that you been
sleeping with the Japanese guy

10:25.600 --> 10:27.900
who blows the leaves
out of your driveway.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.900
It so happens Dorothy's doing
a terrific job.

10:38.000 --> 10:40.633
Matter of fact,
she's negotiating right now

10:40.700 --> 10:44.333
with some very big-name
celebrities to be our emcee.

10:44.400 --> 10:45.633
Like who?

10:45.700 --> 10:48.834
Well... like...

10:48.900 --> 10:53.767
Great news!
We've got Bob Hope for our emcee!

10:53.834 --> 10:55.300
Nice work, Dorothy.

10:55.367 --> 10:57.200
Meeting adjourned.

10:57.266 --> 10:58.667
Isn't that great?

10:58.734 --> 11:00.767
See you soon again, ladies.

11:00.834 --> 11:03.667
Sue, take care.

11:03.734 --> 11:04.600
Bye-bye.

11:05.967 --> 11:09.367
-How did you get Bob Hope?
-I called his office--

11:09.433 --> 11:12.166
-Dorothy, let's talk.
-What did he say?

11:12.233 --> 11:16.133
-I didn't talk directly to him--
-Give Alphonso your keys.

11:16.200 --> 11:18.633
-You talked to his agent?
-No!

11:18.700 --> 11:20.567
You'll love this trick.

11:20.633 --> 11:21.967
Who did you talk to?

11:22.033 --> 11:24.834
A nice receptionist at NBC.

11:24.900 --> 11:27.700
I'm focusing on
this metal object.

11:27.767 --> 11:29.000
That's idiotic!

11:29.066 --> 11:32.400
Be patient. It's a good trick.

11:32.467 --> 11:35.033
You're basing this whole thing
on a conversation

11:35.100 --> 11:37.834
with a telephone
operator at NBC?

11:37.900 --> 11:40.867
Let's tell everyone
it was a big mistake.

11:40.934 --> 11:43.600
<i>-Voila.</i>
-Oh, will you...

11:43.667 --> 11:45.934
-I thought you'd be--
-Just go.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.633
All my keys are bent.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.567
Don't just stand there.
Applaud the man.

12:05.700 --> 12:09.433
(serene music playing)

12:09.934 --> 12:12.900
-How'd it go, Dorothy?
-Awful.

12:12.967 --> 12:16.700
When I said that Bob Hope
wasn't going to appear,

12:16.767 --> 12:18.500
they actually booed me.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.633
Oh...

12:19.700 --> 12:22.233
I've never been so humiliated.

12:22.300 --> 12:25.934
Aw, come on.
You've been humiliated plenty.

12:27.633 --> 12:30.233
Remember cheerleader tryouts
in high school?

12:30.300 --> 12:34.934
Why do you look for ways to amuse
yourself at my expense?

12:34.967 --> 12:38.867
Because we don't have cable,
and I can't crochet.

12:40.734 --> 12:41.834
This is who I am.

12:41.900 --> 12:45.033
Learn to live with it
or medicate me.

12:46.033 --> 12:49.567
I still can't believe
that Rose caused this trouble.

12:49.633 --> 12:50.467
Unbelievable.

12:50.533 --> 12:53.300
This Bob Hope fantasy is sick.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.200
Sick.

12:54.266 --> 12:56.033
If she's going
to have fantasies,

12:56.100 --> 12:58.533
they should be the normal,
healthy kind

12:58.600 --> 13:02.700
like sweaty Argentinean cowboys
whipping things

13:02.767 --> 13:05.734
while they ride naked
on the back of Brahma bulls.

13:13.200 --> 13:16.500
I have to remember
to stop using your towels.

13:19.633 --> 13:22.967
This Rose-Bob Hope thing reminds me
of a similar situation

13:23.033 --> 13:24.667
back in my village.

13:24.734 --> 13:28.266
Florence Pontevicchio
used to fantasize

13:28.333 --> 13:31.200
that Alberto Bolognese
was her brother.

13:31.266 --> 13:33.166
Who was Alberto Bolognese?

13:33.233 --> 13:34.800
The village bootmaker.

13:34.867 --> 13:36.367
So, what's so special?

13:36.433 --> 13:40.934
Did I say special?
I said similar.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.400
I'm having some tea, talking.

13:42.467 --> 13:46.500
You two look like you just paid
for <i>Phantom of The Opera</i> tickets.

13:48.033 --> 13:51.400
Excuse me for not being
Somerset Maugham.

13:51.467 --> 13:55.433
Better I say nothing
and sit here like a pincushion!

13:57.367 --> 13:59.467
Hi, girls.
Did Bob Hope call?

13:59.533 --> 14:02.400
Rose, will you stop being an idiot?

14:02.467 --> 14:04.333
Bob Hope is not going to call.

14:04.400 --> 14:07.266
He is not going
to emcee our show.

14:07.333 --> 14:10.767
I said he'd be here, and he will.

14:10.834 --> 14:14.533
Rose! Rose, this is not
<i>Miracle on 34th Street.</i>

14:15.000 --> 14:19.600
You are a grown woman
holding on to childhood fantasies.

14:19.667 --> 14:22.367
Bob Hope is not your father!

14:22.433 --> 14:24.533
He has no idea who you are,

14:24.600 --> 14:27.233
and he's not coming
anywhere near this place.

14:27.300 --> 14:30.066
That's not true!
He's here in Miami.

14:30.133 --> 14:32.767
It's right in today's paper.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.533
She's right.
He's in a golf tournament here.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.467
Apology accepted.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.934
Rose, what the hell
are you talking about?

14:41.000 --> 14:43.533
That doesn't mean
he'll be in our show.

14:43.600 --> 14:45.000
Don't you see, Dorothy?

14:45.066 --> 14:48.066
He's in Miami
because he knows I need him.

14:48.133 --> 14:51.300
It's working out.
I can feel it.

14:51.367 --> 14:56.633
Dorothy, I think I might have a way
to get Mr. Hope to be in our show.

14:56.700 --> 15:01.300
Let's go to that golf tournament,
find Mr. Hope, and explain things.

15:01.367 --> 15:03.700
He's always doing charity events.

15:03.767 --> 15:06.900
It's worth a shot.

15:06.967 --> 15:09.033
You can skip all that trouble.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.967
He'll be there.
What you need is faith.

15:12.033 --> 15:16.166
What you need is a psychiatrist
who enjoys a challenge.

15:18.967 --> 15:21.734
(soft music playing)

15:21.800 --> 15:24.066
You guys got any
extra shaving cream?

15:25.567 --> 15:27.000
Sure.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.533
This is so weird.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.467
I've never been in
a men's locker room.

15:39.533 --> 15:40.533
Neither have I.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.500
I like the new carpet they...

15:48.567 --> 15:50.333
Me, neither.

15:50.400 --> 15:52.367
This is ridiculous.
It'll never work.

15:52.433 --> 15:56.066
Now, listen. The Caddie said
Mr. Hope just finished golfing.

15:56.133 --> 15:57.367
He's got to be in here somewhere.

15:57.433 --> 15:59.967
Even so, he won't do a favor

16:00.033 --> 16:02.333
for three people who
look like Sam Snead

16:02.400 --> 16:05.800
with a hormone problem.

16:05.867 --> 16:09.100
I'll check out the rest
of the locker room,

16:09.166 --> 16:10.734
starting with the jacuzzi.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.433
You don't know where it is.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.567
Yeah, down here, second do...

16:15.433 --> 16:17.934
I'll ask somebody.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.600
Oh, this has been a nightmare.

16:20.667 --> 16:22.233
Oh, don't worry, Dorothy.

16:22.300 --> 16:25.367
It's all going to work out,
because Bob Hope...

16:25.433 --> 16:27.467
Bob Hope won't let us down.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.233
Right.

16:29.300 --> 16:31.700
I've known you over five years.

16:31.767 --> 16:35.767
In that time, I have heard
the most bizarre stories

16:35.834 --> 16:37.900
I've ever heard in my life.

16:37.967 --> 16:40.266
There was Clovis,
the two-headed mule,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.967
who skied backwards
on buttermilk...

16:43.033 --> 16:46.567
It was cottage cheese.

16:46.633 --> 16:51.667
The point is, Rose, this Bob Hope
story is odd, even for you.

16:51.734 --> 16:53.233
Bob Hope's gone.

16:53.300 --> 16:55.066
We just missed him.

16:55.133 --> 16:57.633
I saw him driving away.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.266
They said he's going to the airport.

16:59.333 --> 17:02.133
The show's tomorrow night.

17:02.200 --> 17:03.200
He wouldn't leave before that.

17:03.266 --> 17:05.066
He knows I'm depending on him.

17:05.133 --> 17:08.500
There must be another explanation.
Maybe...

17:12.000 --> 17:13.767
maybe I'm just
a foolish old woman

17:13.834 --> 17:17.166
who's lived a silly
fantasy her whole life.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.400
Oh, honey.

17:21.333 --> 17:24.300
Now... oh, honey, no.

17:33.867 --> 17:34.800
All right, that's it.

17:34.867 --> 17:36.400
We got to get
that antique dealer

17:36.467 --> 17:38.300
off the membership
committee.

17:41.400 --> 17:45.266
<i>♪ And what he knows</i>
<i>You ain't got mind to lose ♪</i>

17:45.333 --> 17:47.633
<i>♪ These boots are made for walking ♪</i>

17:47.700 --> 17:49.667
<i>♪ And that's just what they'll do ♪</i>

17:49.734 --> 17:54.166
<i>♪ One of these days these boots</i>
<i>Are gonna walk all over you ♪</i>

18:01.200 --> 18:05.834
The Donatello triplets,
ladies and gentlemen.

18:05.900 --> 18:09.500
I'll bet those boots
have more miles on them than...

18:13.734 --> 18:16.367
Joan Collins' waterbed.

18:18.667 --> 18:21.700
Her waterbed.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.967
Now I have a real treat for you.

18:24.033 --> 18:28.367
Straight from Poland,
the Sklarkevitch brothers.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.700
Where's your brother?
Aw, do your best.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.934
Hey!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.867
Do we go on next?

18:39.934 --> 18:41.533
I can't let him.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.367
I gave you the Donatello triplets.
A deal's a deal.

18:45.433 --> 18:48.333
Sophia, Alphonso will
only embarrass himself.

18:48.400 --> 18:50.767
If embarrassment worried him,

18:50.834 --> 18:54.133
he wouldn't walk around
with that much hair in his ears.

18:55.166 --> 18:57.200
Besides,
he and his old vaudeville partner

18:57.266 --> 19:00.033
have perfected
one of their old tricks.

19:00.100 --> 19:02.266
Boo! Boo!

19:02.333 --> 19:04.667
I know.
It's better with your brother.

19:06.200 --> 19:10.100
Well, it can't get any worse.
Alphonso, you're on.

19:11.500 --> 19:15.266
Well... it looks like
I'm in the show after all.

19:19.633 --> 19:22.333
Girls, something
terrible has happened.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.400
Gee, and everything was going
so well up until now.

19:26.467 --> 19:29.233
Bob Hope's name is
still on these programs.

19:29.300 --> 19:31.600
How did that happen?
Who did the programs?

19:31.667 --> 19:34.867
I forgot.
I guess I figured he was gonna come.

19:34.934 --> 19:37.867
We have to make an announcement
and refund everybody's money.

19:37.934 --> 19:40.266
I guess now's as good
a time as any.

19:40.333 --> 19:42.800
It's my fault. I'll do it.

19:42.867 --> 19:44.867
Oh!

19:44.934 --> 19:50.333
And now my beautiful assistant
will step into the magic box.

19:55.467 --> 19:57.467
Alphonso, I need
to make an announcement.

19:57.533 --> 19:59.266
Well, take your time.

19:59.333 --> 20:00.934
I forgot the magic words.

20:03.533 --> 20:06.734
Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Rose Nylund.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.834
I'm responsible for
what's happened here tonight.

20:11.266 --> 20:16.166
Because of a silly, childish dream,
I let you all down.

20:16.233 --> 20:18.066
I had this crazy idea

20:18.133 --> 20:22.066
I had a special connection
to a very special person,

20:22.133 --> 20:26.300
and that's why on your programs
it says that the guest celebrity

20:26.367 --> 20:28.400
for tonight's show is--

20:28.467 --> 20:29.900
Presto!

20:30.700 --> 20:32.133
Bob Hope!

20:32.200 --> 20:35.066
(audience cheers)

20:48.567 --> 20:52.033
Hey, I know this show
is for charity,

20:52.100 --> 20:57.200
but that's the smallest dressing
room I've ever had in my life.

20:57.266 --> 21:00.967
Oh, my God.
You're really Mr. Bob hope.

21:01.033 --> 21:05.600
Being this close to you
is the biggest thrill of my life.

21:05.667 --> 21:10.367
If you were any closer, there
wouldn't be room for my car keys.

21:10.433 --> 21:13.533
Mr. Hope,
could we impose upon you

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
to entertain for a few minutes?

21:15.667 --> 21:16.900
Will I entertain?

21:16.967 --> 21:20.233
I didn't put this makeup on
to go bowling.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.567
Ladies and gentlemen,
Mr. Bob Hope!

21:23.633 --> 21:26.700
Thank you, thank you.

21:26.767 --> 21:29.467
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

21:29.533 --> 21:34.867
Did you hear that Ronald Reagan
has just moved back to Hollywood?

21:34.934 --> 21:39.233
That's just what Hollywood needs,
another unemployed actor.

21:39.300 --> 21:40.734
And you know Reagan left office

21:40.800 --> 21:43.934
with the highest popularity rating
since FDR.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.066
He was more popular
than Tammy Bakker

21:46.133 --> 21:49.166
at a Maybelline convention.

21:49.233 --> 21:52.400
I can't believe it!
How did he get here?

21:52.467 --> 21:56.633
Know how Alphonso kept talking
about his old vaudeville partner?

21:56.700 --> 21:59.900
It turns out it was Bob Hope!
Isn't that a kick?

22:02.900 --> 22:05.200
Since Ron and Nancy
moved back to California,

22:05.266 --> 22:07.967
we've had earthquakes
almost every day.

22:08.033 --> 22:10.633
Do you think God
could be a democrat?

22:13.700 --> 22:16.066
But earthquakes don't
bother the president.

22:16.133 --> 22:20.200
If Sam Donaldson couldn't shake
him up, nothing will.

22:20.266 --> 22:23.734
We owe you an apology, honey.

22:23.800 --> 22:25.166
You were right after all.

22:25.233 --> 22:27.100
You don't owe me anything.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.967
This was a lucky coincidence.

22:29.033 --> 22:31.066
I'm just glad it worked out.

22:31.133 --> 22:37.033
Boy, but I've learned one lesson,
no more silly daydreams for me.

22:37.100 --> 22:41.266
Nancy Reagan has mixed feelings
about moving back to California.

22:41.333 --> 22:43.934
She's afraid her husband
might not have as much free time

22:44.000 --> 22:46.100
to spend with her anymore.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.266
Thanks, Dad.

22:54.567 --> 22:56.433
Thank you.

22:58.967 --> 23:01.834
(theme music playing)
