00:09.719 --> 00:12.847
<i>NARRATOR".
Thus far, we have seen King Tut...</i>

00:13.014 --> 00:16.184
<i>...and his tank full of lovelies.</i>

00:16.601 --> 00:20.021
<i>While his Tutling heists some amber beads.</i>

00:20.188 --> 00:22.440
<i>But why?</i>

00:22.815 --> 00:26.361
<i>A vitamin pill and a call for help.</i>

00:26.945 --> 00:29.739
<i>Even Batman is stumped.</i>

00:29.906 --> 00:31.366
His one lead...

00:31.533 --> 00:34.160
<i>...a lead pestle?</i>

00:34.536 --> 00:40.583
<i>An unholy operation to release sacred scarabs
from their ancient tombs.</i>

00:41.125 --> 00:43.294
<i>Shock treatments to resurrect them.</i>

00:43.461 --> 00:44.796
<i>Shocking.</i>

00:46.339 --> 00:48.800
<i>The pestle leads to an apothecary shop...</i>

00:48.967 --> 00:52.220
<i>...but Tut escapes with his scarabs.</i>

00:53.054 --> 00:56.140
<i>All but one, that is.</i>

00:56.558 --> 01:00.395
<i>A breeding farm for the plague?</i>

01:01.104 --> 01:03.189
<i>No, even worse.</i>

01:03.356 --> 01:09.821
<i>Abu raubu simbu tu,
a deadly potion to paralyze the will.</i>

01:10.154 --> 01:12.657
<i>A clever ploy of Batman's.</i>

01:13.283 --> 01:15.910
<i>Robin in the sphinx.</i>

01:16.953 --> 01:20.081
<i>And the Boy Wonder gives it away.</i>

01:20.665 --> 01:24.419
<i>A precarious perch for the Boy Wonder.</i>

01:25.420 --> 01:28.590
<i>And Batman to the rescue.</i>

01:29.007 --> 01:31.843
<i>But does Tut have the last word?</i>

01:32.010 --> 01:36.514
<i>Don't go away.
The most horrendous is yet to happen.</i>

02:52.924 --> 02:56.469
Farewell, my moldy sparrow.

02:56.636 --> 02:58.137
In the name of Anubis...

02:58.304 --> 03:01.849
...great jackal-headed patron
of the super-criminal...

03:02.016 --> 03:07.230
...I commend you to your fate.
Ha, ha, ha.

03:07.730 --> 03:11.109
Come, my loyal lieges, let's away.

03:11.275 --> 03:18.157
I love my crocodiles madly, but I dislike
the sound of their chewing. Heh, heh, heh.

03:18.324 --> 03:21.577
And I'm sure the commissioner
awaits his pill.

03:23.121 --> 03:25.123
Don't forget to feed the scarabs.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.410
- Hang on, Robin.
-Batman.

04:02.577 --> 04:05.163
Hang on, old churn.

04:31.355 --> 04:32.857
I'll try something else.

04:46.162 --> 04:49.040
Don't lose heart, Robin. Here I come.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.855
It was my fault, Batman.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.191
Dropping the Bat-radio in the sphinx.

05:15.358 --> 05:17.068
I'll be more careful next time.

05:17.235 --> 05:19.904
Experience teaches slowly, Robin.

05:20.071 --> 05:22.532
And at the cost of many mistakes.

05:22.907 --> 05:24.617
You know how wives are, Chief O'Hara.

05:24.784 --> 05:27.745
It's our anniversary,
and I promised I'd take her to lunch...

05:27.912 --> 05:30.414
...but leaving this office
under the circumstances...

05:30.581 --> 05:34.418
Think no more about it, commissioner.
I'll be proud to take over for an hour or so.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.838
I consider it an honor that you've asked me.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.422
I hoped you'd say that.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.801
Miss Patrick, Chief O'Hara is in charge
of this office until I return.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.762
Please, follow routine procedure.

05:45.638 --> 05:48.599
- Have a good time.
- I will, now.

05:49.308 --> 05:52.144
- Your pill, Chief O'Hara.
-I never take pills.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.188
-It's routine procedure.
-Hm?

05:59.944 --> 06:02.530
<i>BATMAN". Commissioner,
thank heavens I've reached you in time.</i>

06:02.697 --> 06:05.074
Oh, the commissioner has just stepped out,
Batman.

06:05.241 --> 06:08.452
This is Chief O'Hara.
I'm in charge here for the time being.

06:08.619 --> 06:10.830
Well, thank heavens I reached you,
Chief O'Hara.

06:10.997 --> 06:12.665
There's treachery in that office.

06:12.832 --> 06:16.794
The commissioner's summer secretary,
the one who's replacing Bonnie...

06:16.961 --> 06:19.589
...is King Tut's current queen of the Nile.

06:20.131 --> 06:22.800
<i>- Begorra.
-We'll be there within a half hour.</i>

06:22.967 --> 06:27.305
But don't be persuaded to take
one of the commissioner's vitamin capsules.

06:27.763 --> 06:31.517
Oh, don't you worry, Caped Crusader,
I wouldn't even think of--

06:31.684 --> 06:33.269
I already took one.

06:37.565 --> 06:39.317
Are me eyes playing me tricks?

06:39.775 --> 06:42.069
King Tut, here in this office.

06:42.236 --> 06:45.489
How did you get here?
Didn't anybody see you?

06:46.657 --> 06:48.951
Yes, they saw me.

06:49.118 --> 06:52.747
But I spoke to that charming
and cooperative secretary of yours...

06:52.914 --> 06:56.876
...and told her we wish to be alone
for a little private chat.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.711
Unmitigated gall.

06:58.878 --> 07:01.005
On your knees, helot.

07:01.172 --> 07:02.590
You got the wrong helot.

07:02.757 --> 07:04.842
On your knees anyway!

07:05.009 --> 07:09.263
The devil you say, Tut.
You'll not bend my will to yours.

07:32.453 --> 07:33.871
Batman, look.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.334
What's he doing out there?

07:38.501 --> 07:39.835
I suspect the worst, Robin.

07:40.002 --> 07:42.296
Chief O'Hara, take it easy.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.049
Hi. Hello, down there, me buckos.

07:45.216 --> 07:48.928
He's doing a dance out there
on that itty-bitty ledge. Ha, ha!

07:49.178 --> 07:54.058
Yeah, I know.
My every whim is his command.

07:55.685 --> 07:59.689
- Oh, Tut-tut, give another whim. This is boss.
-Heh, heh, heh.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.983
I'm spoiling you rotten.

08:02.733 --> 08:05.945
I never could resist a pretty queen.

08:07.405 --> 08:09.865
- Chief O'Hara.
-Huh?

08:10.116 --> 08:13.035
Sorry to disturb you. A little acrobatics.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.578
Use the pole.

08:18.582 --> 08:21.585
Oh, that's very good.

08:22.837 --> 08:25.047
Don't fall. Heh, heh, heh.

08:26.966 --> 08:28.050
Holy high wire.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.614
It's Batman and Robin. Eeh!

08:50.781 --> 08:53.492
He should be giving my crocodiles indigestion
by this time.

08:53.659 --> 08:56.245
How do you suppose
he got out of that locked tank room?

08:56.412 --> 08:58.122
Chief O'Hara ought to know better.

08:58.289 --> 09:00.499
It's unwise to condemn
what we don't understand.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.376
He can't help himself now.

09:02.543 --> 09:04.295
But let's try to talk to him.

09:05.004 --> 09:06.172
Let's away again, my pet.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.508
- We have enough sport for one morning.
-Without even seeing him?

09:09.675 --> 09:11.802
Batman, that is.

09:11.969 --> 09:15.890
Cleo, just what does Batman mean to you?

09:16.057 --> 09:20.644
Oh, I guess it's all that restoratory power
in his body.

09:20.811 --> 09:23.564
Or... Or whatever he said.

09:23.731 --> 09:27.318
Restoratory power in his body. Mm-hm.

09:27.485 --> 09:30.654
I'll give you restoratory power. Get in there!

09:30.821 --> 09:33.074
Her wheelbarrow

09:33.240 --> 09:36.911
<i>Through the streets
Wide and narrow</i>

09:52.468 --> 09:54.386
Chief O'Hara, come in now.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.013
Come on in, chief. Easy, now.

09:57.181 --> 10:00.351
Chief O'Hara, it's time to come in now.

10:00.851 --> 10:02.686
- It is?
-Come along.

10:05.481 --> 10:06.982
Easy, now.

10:07.149 --> 10:09.693
That's it. Take it easy.

10:26.252 --> 10:28.546
MY pets.

10:28.712 --> 10:30.506
My babies.

10:31.090 --> 10:34.426
My beautiful emerald black cherubims.

10:35.845 --> 10:38.556
They all must die.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.975
Yes, Your Kingship.

10:41.142 --> 10:45.354
But remember, it's for an evil cause.

10:45.646 --> 10:50.025
And also remember
that they will yield at least 95,000 gallons...

10:50.192 --> 10:53.696
...of abu raubu simbu tu.

10:54.029 --> 10:59.201
Zowee! That's enough bug juice
to clop everybody in Gotham City...

10:59.368 --> 11:02.079
...or my name ain't Amenophis Tewfik.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.708
If you say that again, I'm gonna slap you.

11:07.918 --> 11:09.587
But you're right.

11:09.753 --> 11:12.882
After scarabating the city water supply...

11:13.048 --> 11:16.719
...I'll make loyal subjects of them all.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.763
- You weren't born yesterday either, Tut-tut.
-Heh, heh.

11:19.930 --> 11:23.934
I just hope we can get the stuff brewed
before Batman finds us.

11:26.437 --> 11:30.191
Batman, that big ninny.

11:30.357 --> 11:34.028
I'll have him eating out of my hand.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.072
And that'll have him drinking out of it.

11:37.239 --> 11:42.119
And I'll use Chief O'Hara
as the catalytic agent.

11:42.286 --> 11:44.830
Well, we'll have to use Commissioner Gordon.
He's back.

11:44.997 --> 11:48.459
- Chief O'Hara's left.
-That's even better.

11:48.918 --> 11:53.297
The time has come
to execute my royal master plan.

11:53.464 --> 11:56.133
Royal lapidary,
prepare the transfer of the sphinx...

11:56.300 --> 12:00.721
...while I pay the commissioner a brief call.
Ha, ha, ha.

12:01.639 --> 12:03.349
I say the first order of business...

12:03.515 --> 12:06.810
...is to have Commissioner Gordon
and Chief O'Hara removed from office.

12:06.977 --> 12:11.523
I mean, we can't have police officials
who are helpless pawns of a master criminal.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.026
Here we are, sir. Six glasses of buttermilk.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.653
Oh, thank you, Alfred.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.030
You can discount Chief O'Hara.

12:18.197 --> 12:22.201
Robin, I suspect he's the victim
of happenstance.

12:22.368 --> 12:25.204
That still leaves Commissioner Gordon.

12:28.666 --> 12:33.420
Unfounded suspicions are often dangerous,
old man.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.090
Maybe, but we'd better do something.

12:36.257 --> 12:39.885
Agreed. If we're to thwart Tut's evil scheme...

12:40.052 --> 12:44.348
...I suspect the answer
is to be found in these...

12:45.307 --> 12:47.268
...dusty pages.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.853
If there is an answer.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.773
For every venom, there's an antidote, Robin.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.525
I've already discovered...

12:54.692 --> 13:00.447
...that the Nile Oasis Scarab became extinct
40 centuries ago.

13:03.659 --> 13:04.785
Yes, commissioner.

13:05.703 --> 13:11.000
I'm very sorry to disturb you,
but this is very important.

13:11.166 --> 13:14.253
Now, listen very carefully.

13:14.420 --> 13:17.881
This is what you have to do.

13:22.052 --> 13:23.804
Very well, commissioner.

13:23.971 --> 13:26.432
We'll be there right away.

13:31.562 --> 13:34.732
The sphinx has reappeared.

13:35.065 --> 13:37.901
He's in Jefferson Square Park...

13:38.068 --> 13:41.405
...and it's making predictions...

13:41.655 --> 13:43.782
...just as I predicted.

13:51.915 --> 13:55.544
<i>Loyal subjects, I have returned.</i>

13:56.045 --> 13:58.422
<i>And now for my latest prediction.</i>

13:58.589 --> 14:04.094
<i>Your all-powerful, all-conquering, all-good,
friendly pharaoh will reduce water rates...</i>

14:04.261 --> 14:09.641
<i>...give you more drinking fountains,
and will positively stamp out Bat brutality.</i>

14:09.808 --> 14:15.230
<i>This is a promise. This is a plague.
This is a recording.</i>

14:15.397 --> 14:20.152
Oh, the Batman, and Robin the Boy Wonder.
You heard?

14:20.319 --> 14:22.780
New slogan, same old Tut.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.656
But he's right about one thing.

14:24.823 --> 14:29.578
Our fair city could use more drinking fountains.
I'm parched, aren't you?

14:30.454 --> 14:36.960
Oh. A quaint, old-fashioned
refreshments cart. Ha, ha, ha.

14:37.628 --> 14:41.048
May I treat you to a lemonade?

14:41.256 --> 14:43.884
Thank you, commissioner.
That sounds refreshing.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.469
- Boy Wonder?
-No, thank you.

14:45.636 --> 14:47.054
Very well, son.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.184
Two, if you please.

14:52.351 --> 14:54.853
I hope you know what you're doing,
Batman.

14:55.020 --> 14:57.523
He seems quite his old self.

14:57.981 --> 14:59.358
Fine.

14:59.525 --> 15:01.276
Thank you.

15:11.829 --> 15:14.373
Ah. Thank you, commissioner.

15:14.540 --> 15:15.833
To your health.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.793
Never been better. I'm top-hole...

15:17.960 --> 15:20.796
...and as eager as ever
to fight the forces of evil.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.339
To that too.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.008
I'll get that.

15:27.970 --> 15:32.724
And may the first super-criminal
to feel our righteous wrath be King Tut.

15:32.891 --> 15:35.561
I'll sign that one on the dotted line.

15:36.437 --> 15:37.521
It's for you, Batman.

15:37.896 --> 15:39.273
Excuse me, commissioner.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.442
Surely, surely, surely.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.737
It's King Tut, Batman.
And he insists on talking to you right now.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.324
He does, does he?
Well, I've got a message for him.

15:50.868 --> 15:53.579
Tut, this is Batman.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.706
Yes.

15:56.957 --> 15:58.625
Yes.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.672
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:03.839 --> 16:07.593
Of course, my good and friendly pharaoh.

16:07.759 --> 16:10.888
Your every wish is my command.

16:11.054 --> 16:14.558
I hear and obey.

16:16.894 --> 16:18.479
What is it, Batman?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.564
What's the matter?

16:21.231 --> 16:23.859
Batman, what's wrong?

16:26.111 --> 16:29.239
I can't tell what it is,
but I think something's happened to Batman.

16:29.406 --> 16:33.285
He may have fallen under the spell of King Tut.
Can't you do something?

16:36.455 --> 16:39.583
Batman. Commissioner Gordon.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.546
Batman, we bring you greetings
from His Kingship Tut.

16:44.713 --> 16:48.926
I hear and I obey.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.764
Batman.

17:01.313 --> 17:04.273
Never mind, Robin. Never mind.

17:13.659 --> 17:17.079
Making progress, royal apothecary?

17:20.123 --> 17:22.876
Tanks are almost full, Your Kingship.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.502
Good.

17:24.670 --> 17:29.007
As soon as my visitor arrives
and pays me homage...

17:29.174 --> 17:33.845
...we'll conclude my royal master plan.
-Ha, ha, ha.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.489
Hail, mighty Tut.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.660
Take heed, loyal subject...

17:56.994 --> 18:01.498
...and note well that what was prophesied
has come to pass.

18:01.665 --> 18:06.044
Mine enemy kneels at mine feet.

18:06.211 --> 18:08.547
Here's another one, boss.

18:09.006 --> 18:11.466
On your knees, Bat-brat.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.927
Never! Get up, Batman.

18:15.512 --> 18:18.307
You see, ex-Boy Wonder?

18:18.473 --> 18:22.853
He now responds only to my command.

18:23.687 --> 18:27.399
Tut, you are the greatest.

18:31.153 --> 18:33.363
I had planned a command performance...

18:33.530 --> 18:38.368
...to prove that this cringing crusader
is no longer cock of the walk...

18:38.535 --> 18:41.246
...but merely a court jester, a buffoon.

18:41.413 --> 18:44.625
But I see by the royal apothecary
that the tanks are filled.

18:44.791 --> 18:48.462
I must be off about my affairs.

18:48.629 --> 18:51.715
- Tut-tut.
-Yeah?

18:51.882 --> 18:57.554
Can I command a performance of my own
while you're gone?

18:58.930 --> 19:00.891
I want a jester of my own.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.603
And you shall have one, my queen.

19:04.770 --> 19:07.397
After I have scarabated the water supply...

19:07.564 --> 19:11.485
...you can have your choice of anyone
in Gotham City.

19:13.945 --> 19:17.866
Anyone who's left, that is.

19:18.241 --> 19:22.704
But these two are going to be fed
to my crocodiles right now.

19:22.871 --> 19:25.248
No, no! Not Batman!

19:27.292 --> 19:29.252
Another outburst like that, Cleo...

19:29.419 --> 19:33.256
...and my crocodiles are going to have
a three-course meal. Hm?

19:34.216 --> 19:36.301
He's filled his purpose.

19:36.468 --> 19:41.390
And anyway,
my slithering lovelies missed their lunch.

19:41.556 --> 19:47.270
Tonight, they shall have
a truly succulent feast. Ha, ha, ha.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.106
Take them away.

19:49.272 --> 19:53.026
I'm off to the waterworks.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.546
Your Kingship,
Batman's come out of his spell.

20:14.172 --> 20:17.259
Correction, I never was under your spell, Tut.

20:17.426 --> 20:19.803
Oh, I drank your cursed lemonade...

20:19.970 --> 20:24.766
...but I took the precaution
of coating my stomach with buttermilk.

20:25.392 --> 20:26.685
Gosh, Batman.

20:26.977 --> 20:29.980
A pure and simple stratagem...

20:30.147 --> 20:32.983
...to divine the super-evil crime
you planned...

20:33.150 --> 20:36.820
...not only against your fellow man
but against Mother Nature herself.

20:37.112 --> 20:39.322
Buttermilk. Ugh.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.908
A plague on you, Batman.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.411
- Tutlings, sic them.
-Ah!

21:41.802 --> 21:45.388
Unh! Unh! Not now!

21:52.771 --> 21:55.023
Open that hose valve.

21:57.567 --> 22:01.738
Keep your hands off my abu raubu simbu tu!

22:04.241 --> 22:06.827
No. Not my life's work.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.580
My life's blood
and that of my lovely scarabs.

22:10.747 --> 22:13.333
All for naught. For naught.

22:17.963 --> 22:20.549
You. You!

22:20.715 --> 22:22.551
You're the one.

22:22.717 --> 22:24.219
You're--

22:25.512 --> 22:31.184
You're the nicest man I've ever met, Batman,
and this humble servant kneels at your feet.

22:31.351 --> 22:34.104
His formula, it's working on him.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.106
Poor deluded man.

22:36.273 --> 22:39.276
He's walking a tightrope, Robin.

22:39.693 --> 22:43.738
Abu raubu simbu tu plays no favorites.

22:43.905 --> 22:48.368
Gotham City has narrowly averted
a catastrophe of major proportions.

22:48.535 --> 22:52.998
Too bad that such a distinguished professor
in his twin trauma...

22:53.164 --> 22:57.586
...should become his own Cavia porcellus.

22:57.752 --> 22:59.838
<i>Ca via parcel/us?</i>

23:00.005 --> 23:02.132
Guinea pig.

23:04.926 --> 23:07.512
I'm appalled, Batman, truly appalled...

23:07.679 --> 23:10.765
...to think that I could have betrayed
my high office.

23:10.932 --> 23:13.268
And to have slipped you
a polluted lemonade.

23:13.435 --> 23:15.979
Don't give it another thought, commissioner.

23:21.735 --> 23:23.445
That will be all, young gentlemen.

23:23.612 --> 23:26.448
Complete your assignments
and hand them in tomorrow.

23:26.615 --> 23:28.199
Not again.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.160
I'm off to a faculty meeting.

23:30.327 --> 23:33.622
Oh, you're off, all right,
but not to a faculty meeting.

23:33.788 --> 23:38.460
Your phony Egyptian friends
await our royal presence at the local tombs.

23:38.627 --> 23:40.629
Well-- Ah!

23:40.837 --> 23:43.214
I'm a professor at Yale.

23:43.381 --> 23:44.591
You can't do--

23:44.758 --> 23:47.135
The PTA shall hear of this.

23:47.302 --> 23:49.554
- Where am I?
-Are you going to try him in court?

23:49.721 --> 23:53.141
I haven't decided yet.
With your approval, I'd like to think it over.

23:53.308 --> 23:56.311
No choice is easy in a case like this.

23:56.478 --> 23:58.063
I agree completely, commissioner.

23:58.229 --> 24:00.440
The law of this city is in your hands.

24:00.607 --> 24:06.237
We just try to help a bit here and there,
wherever we can.

24:10.075 --> 24:15.872
So brave, so dependable and so modest.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.751
Rare in men these days.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.546
Very rare.
