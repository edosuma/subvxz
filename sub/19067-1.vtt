<i>-Who cares? Wormhole!</i>

01:26.962 --> 01:29.089
[yelling]

01:39.891 --> 01:41.184
Coran, what's happening?

01:41.268 --> 01:43.478
The integrity of the wormhole
has been compromised.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.689
-It's breaking down!
-What does that mean?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.191
It means we have no control
over where we're headed!

01:48.275 --> 01:52.529
[all grunting, screaming]

01:54.573 --> 01:56.783
[Lance]
Keith! Shiro!

01:56.867 --> 01:59.620
[screaming continues]

02:01.872 --> 02:03.915
They've vanished
through the temporal rift!

02:04.583 --> 02:06.168
The lions are gone!

[groans, coughs]

02:47.167 --> 02:48.668
[sighs]

02:49.336 --> 02:50.545
You okay, Red?

02:52.672 --> 02:56.927
Okay. We'll fix you up.
We had a tough battle.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.692
Where are we? Where have we landed?

03:12.776 --> 03:14.611
[gasps]
Shiro.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.780
Shiro!

03:26.123 --> 03:27.999
-[alarm blaring]
-Whoa! [screaming]

03:39.219 --> 03:41.138
[groans]

03:41.805 --> 03:43.849
Huh? What's the matter, girl?

03:49.020 --> 03:52.190
Okay, rest a bit. I'll see what I can do.

03:53.942 --> 03:58.530
Looks like there's no gravity here.
It's like a trash nebula of some kind.

04:00.157 --> 04:04.369
Okay, Pidge, stay calm. You know what
they say. "When you get lost in space,

04:04.453 --> 04:08.081
the best thing to do is stay put
and wait for people to find you."

04:08.165 --> 04:10.751
This'll be nice.
I'll have some "me" time.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.551
No one to annoy me.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.397
Let's check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

04:32.481 --> 04:34.399
to see where this wormhole is taking us.

04:34.483 --> 04:37.736
Coran, look! There appears to be
something on the other end.

04:37.819 --> 04:41.114
-We're heading right toward it!
-Scanners show that there's no exit.

04:41.198 --> 04:45.535
It's just nothingness. Find an exit
before we run smack into the void!

04:46.953 --> 04:49.080
I can't. I've lost control of the Castle.

04:49.164 --> 04:51.541
Brace yourself! We're about to hit it!

04:56.755 --> 04:58.799
Let's check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

04:58.882 --> 05:00.801
to see where this wormhole is taking us.

05:03.720 --> 05:06.348
-Coran, we're okay!
-What are you talking about?

05:06.431 --> 05:07.849
We've lost all the lions!

05:07.933 --> 05:10.936
We've just smashed into a black void.
Don't you remember? Hmm?

05:11.019 --> 05:15.857
[gasps] What happened to the mice?
They've transformed.

05:15.941 --> 05:17.943
[all squeaking]

05:18.026 --> 05:20.946
-[gasps] Coran?
-Why are you looking at me like that?

05:21.029 --> 05:23.448
Do I have a boogie stuck
in my mustache again?

05:23.532 --> 05:26.117
No. You look younger.
[grunts]

05:26.993 --> 05:30.330
Scanners show that there's no exit.
It's just nothingness!

05:30.413 --> 05:31.665
You said that already!

05:31.748 --> 05:34.417
Find an exit before we run
smack into the void!

05:34.501 --> 05:37.212
I'm entering coordinates
to get us out of here.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.422
The Castle won't accept an end point.

05:39.506 --> 05:43.343
-Just enter any coordinates!
-I tried, but the system is locked.

05:43.426 --> 05:47.097
I can't get a signal out
or receive a signal in. [gasps]

05:47.180 --> 05:48.640
Allura!

05:55.105 --> 05:57.023
Let's check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

05:57.107 --> 05:59.025
to see where this wormhole is taking us.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.862
Oh, no! You're even younger now!

06:02.946 --> 06:04.364
What's the matter?
You look confused.

06:04.447 --> 06:07.617
Don't worry, Princess,
I'll get us out of here.

06:07.701 --> 06:08.618
-[sighs]
-[growls]

06:08.702 --> 06:11.371
[screams] We appear to be
in some sort of time loop

06:11.454 --> 06:13.832
that's affecting everyone but me.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.334
Scanners show
that there's no exit. It's just...

06:16.418 --> 06:19.421
Nothingness, I know.
And we can't find another exit point.

06:19.504 --> 06:23.466
Don't just stand there. We've got to find
a way. I'll never give in to nothingness!

06:35.604 --> 06:37.105
[groans]

06:43.236 --> 06:45.655
[static]

06:46.615 --> 06:49.159
Keith, are you there? Keith?

06:49.701 --> 06:51.828
I've got to get to higher ground.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.918
[panting]
Shiro, can you hear me?

07:00.295 --> 07:01.588
Shiro?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.674
[static]

07:04.758 --> 07:06.551
Shiro, are you there?

07:14.768 --> 07:18.939
[groaning, panting]

07:20.315 --> 07:22.692
[breaking up]
<i>Shiro, are you there? Answer me!</i>

07:22.776 --> 07:25.946
Keith. I'm here.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.072
Keith.

07:27.155 --> 07:30.283
-[groaning]
<i>-Shiro, it's Keith.</i>

07:31.576 --> 07:34.329
Keith. Keith, I'm here. I'm okay.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.916
[chuckles]
Shiro, you made it.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.543
It takes more than a glowing alien wound,

07:40.627 --> 07:43.880
a fall from the upper atmosphere,
and crashing into a hard pan surface,

07:43.964 --> 07:48.343
at what I'm guessing is about 25 meters
per second squared, to get rid of me.

07:48.426 --> 07:52.722
-How are you?
-Not good. My lion's busted.

07:52.806 --> 07:54.432
Wait, what wound?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.227
It's nothing.

07:58.395 --> 08:00.146
[screaming]

08:01.106 --> 08:02.816
[groaning]

08:02.899 --> 08:04.734
<i>Hang on, I'm coming.</i>

08:04.818 --> 08:09.656
[growling, snarling]

08:14.536 --> 08:16.997
On second thought,
you'd better hurry.

08:31.761 --> 08:32.595
[yelps]

08:35.557 --> 08:36.558
Who's there?

08:45.525 --> 08:49.279
[creatures chattering, squeaking]

08:53.158 --> 08:56.911
Hmm? Aw! Hey, little guys!

08:56.995 --> 09:01.499
Aw, you guys are so cute.
Too cute to be found in a dump like this.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.586
Are you guys the only ones living here?

09:05.211 --> 09:07.589
I hope my rough landing
didn't disturb your day.

09:07.672 --> 09:11.509
I'll only be here for a short time.
I'm waiting for my friends to find me.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.553
We were separated
during a wormhole jump.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.056
[squeaking, chattering]

09:17.557 --> 09:19.309
Yeah, friends!

09:22.187 --> 09:24.647
I sure hope they find me soon.

09:27.609 --> 09:29.569
[indifferently] Let's check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

09:29.652 --> 09:31.654
to see where this wormhole is taking us.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.574
[sighs]
This is so boring.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.660
Coran, please! I don't need
any of your attitude right now.

09:37.744 --> 09:41.206
You don't understand me at all!
You have no idea what I'm going through!

09:41.289 --> 09:43.875
I'll be in my control area! Hmmph!

09:45.251 --> 09:47.670
I can't manually enter coordinates.

09:47.754 --> 09:51.549
But the Castle will automatically
lock on to the lions' whereabouts,

09:51.633 --> 09:52.842
if we can locate them.

09:56.638 --> 10:00.100
It's not working! I'm unable
to hone in on their location.

10:00.183 --> 10:01.893
[loud operatic music playing]

10:01.976 --> 10:05.021
Coran, turn that down!
Our lives are at stake!

10:05.105 --> 10:08.108
I can only express myself through music!

10:08.191 --> 10:12.612
Coran, if you don't turn that down,
I swear I'll turn this Castle around and--

10:12.695 --> 10:15.740
And what? We're just gonna run
into this void that's coming up here.

10:16.449 --> 10:18.034
I hate everybody!

10:21.996 --> 10:24.165
Let's check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

10:24.249 --> 10:26.209
to see where this wormhole is taking us,

10:26.292 --> 10:27.669
whatever that means.

10:27.752 --> 10:30.088
We've tried everything
and nothing's worked.

10:30.171 --> 10:33.508
A few more trips down this wormhole
and you're going to disappear.

10:33.591 --> 10:37.178
-We must find a way out.
-Just blast your way out! Duh!

10:37.262 --> 10:38.930
I suppose it's worth a try.

10:39.013 --> 10:42.600
The Castle defenses might have
enough firepower to destroy the tunnel.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.978
Yeah! And it'll go ker-plooey!

10:49.190 --> 10:52.443
[Allura] <i> It's not working!</i>
<i>It's like we're shooting at ourselves.</i>

10:52.527 --> 10:54.237
[Coran blows raspberry]
Where's Voltron?

11:01.327 --> 11:04.873
-Shiro, what happened?
-<i>There's several creatures.</i>

11:08.459 --> 11:09.878
[grunts]
Huh?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.425
[snarling]

11:17.010 --> 11:18.136
[roars]

11:29.564 --> 11:30.565
Uh-oh.

11:46.664 --> 11:47.624
[screams]

11:47.707 --> 11:50.293
[grunting]

11:50.376 --> 11:53.880

[groaning]

12:06.684 --> 12:09.437
[groaning]

12:09.520 --> 12:12.065
Keith, are you okay?
What happened?

12:12.732 --> 12:17.987
[grunting] Minor delay,
but I'm on my way. How are you?

12:18.905 --> 12:21.616
I'm all right, but I'm trapped in a cave,

12:21.699 --> 12:24.494
and some nasty-looking creatures
have me cornered.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.207
Stay put. I'm on my way.

12:30.124 --> 12:33.628
I just have to... figure this out.

12:33.711 --> 12:37.173
"My name is Keith. I'm so emo."

12:37.256 --> 12:39.676
"Shiro, you're our leader.
What should we do?"

12:39.759 --> 12:43.179
"We'll get through this
if we work together. We're a team."

12:43.262 --> 12:46.933
"Look at me! I'm Lance.
Hey, is that a cute girl over there?"

12:47.016 --> 12:51.229
"I don't feel good. The smell
of this place makes me want to barf."

12:51.312 --> 12:54.399
"Paladins, please.
We must defeat Zarkon."

12:55.108 --> 12:57.694
"Blah, blah, blah!
Crazy words. Mustache."

12:57.777 --> 12:59.404
-Huh?
-[creatures squeaking]

12:59.487 --> 13:00.822
What is it?

13:06.119 --> 13:09.080
Hey, you're working again!
Welcome back!

13:10.373 --> 13:11.791

13:20.383 --> 13:22.677
[chattering, squeaking]

13:22.760 --> 13:26.889
No, it's not my friends.
It's just an old, rusty satellite.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.725
[gasps]

13:28.808 --> 13:32.895
Hey! Maybe I can find my friends
before they find me.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.103
[sighs]

14:15.646 --> 14:18.274
Patience yields focus.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.278
That really stayed with you, didn't it?

14:23.780 --> 14:25.573
You've given me some good advice.

14:31.287 --> 14:35.458
If it wasn't for you,
my life would have been a lot different.

14:35.541 --> 14:39.587
Yeah. You wouldn't have crashed
a flying lion on an alien planet

14:39.670 --> 14:42.090
and be stuck with little hope of rescue.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.176
So, you're welcome.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.178
[coughing]

14:47.845 --> 14:49.347
Stay with me, Shiro.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.503
Hang on. I'm on my way.

15:20.586 --> 15:23.631
Good, because these guys
just started digging.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.555
[gasps]

15:30.638 --> 15:32.098
[chuckling]

15:32.181 --> 15:35.560

Monitor to see where this worm goes.

-I hungry.

16:21.772 --> 16:23.274
[screaming]

16:23.357 --> 16:25.943
Coran, no! That is not a toy.

16:26.027 --> 16:30.740
You're going to break the Castle
and everything will stop! Wait a second.

16:31.407 --> 16:34.452
Perhaps we can simply stop
the Castle from moving.

16:34.535 --> 16:35.953
No! Mine!

16:38.206 --> 16:42.418
[powering down]

16:42.502 --> 16:46.756
I've shut down all the power.
Why are we still moving towards the void?

[crying]
My control panel!

16:55.848 --> 16:59.018
-[cooing, crying]
-I know, I know.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.979
Who wants to check
the Rift Exit Positioning Monitor

17:02.063 --> 17:04.482
to see where this wormhole is taking us?

17:04.565 --> 17:08.027
-You do, that's who.
-[cooing]

17:08.109 --> 17:09.862
We have to get out of this loop

17:09.945 --> 17:12.198
before the only thing left of you
is your mustache.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.157

That ought to do it.

18:43.956 --> 18:46.751
Now, let's see if we can
get a hold of the Castle.

18:53.090 --> 18:58.179
No, no! What's wrong? I need to get
out of here! I need to find my friends!

18:58.262 --> 18:59.388
Come on!

19:00.473 --> 19:01.557
[roars]

19:09.273 --> 19:10.650
[growling]

19:12.193 --> 19:15.863
Thanks. Now, let's see
if this thing works.

19:15.946 --> 19:16.906
[grunts]

19:16.989 --> 19:20.326
I hope the signal's strong enough
to reach the Castle.

19:23.913 --> 19:25.748
Coran, what are we going to do?

19:25.831 --> 19:29.168
If we hit the end of the tunnel again,
you'll cease to exist.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.379
[gasps]

19:32.505 --> 19:36.175
I'm sorry. You were like
a second father to me.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.011
-[electronic beeping]
-[gasps]

19:39.095 --> 19:44.892
Coran, look! The Castle has locked
onto a coordinate. Come on. Come on!

19:56.070 --> 19:57.488
We made it!

19:57.571 --> 19:59.198
-[snoring]
-[groans]

20:02.702 --> 20:04.120
Mm?

20:04.203 --> 20:05.204
Mom?

20:05.287 --> 20:07.415
[screams, groans]

20:07.498 --> 20:08.749
[chuckles]

20:13.879 --> 20:17.133
You saved us, Pidge.
We were stuck in a time loop.

20:17.216 --> 20:19.552
You got us out with this giant trash pile.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.139
<i>It's a make-shift communications link</i>
<i>that sends out the Green Lion energy.</i>

20:23.222 --> 20:25.558
<i>It's similar to the energy that guided</i>
<i>the Blue Lion home.</i>

20:25.641 --> 20:27.059
Pidge, you're a genius!

20:27.143 --> 20:30.479
I know. Besides, it wasn't just me.
They helped.

20:30.855 --> 20:33.607
[chattering, squeaking]

20:37.611 --> 20:40.322
-Hmm...
-Let's go get the rest of the paladins.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.620
[Shiro] Thanks for saving me.

20:46.704 --> 20:51.041
You'd have done the same for me.
How's your wound?

20:51.125 --> 20:55.004
My wound's great.
It's getting bigger all the time.

20:56.005 --> 20:58.841
Just trying to lighten the mood.

20:58.924 --> 21:04.388
Hang in there. When Allura and Coran
find us, they'll fix you right up.

21:04.472 --> 21:08.017
Keith, if I don't make it out of here...

21:09.018 --> 21:11.312
I want you to lead Voltron.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.399
Stop talking like that.
You're gonna make it.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.738
Huh?

21:37.379 --> 21:41.801
[Zarkon] <i>Explain to me</i>
<i>how you let Voltron escape.</i>

21:41.884 --> 21:44.553
[Prorok]
Perhaps it was a mechanical failure, sire.

21:44.637 --> 21:48.265
Haggar boosted the solar barrier's power
beyond its normal limits.

21:48.349 --> 21:50.643
This was no mechanical failure.

21:50.726 --> 21:55.397
The two sentries that were guarding
the barrier control were found destroyed.

21:55.481 --> 21:57.441
This was clearly sabotage.

21:57.525 --> 22:01.028
Lord Zarkon, I will start
an investigation immediately.

22:01.111 --> 22:03.906
I will not rest
until the perpetrators are captured.

22:04.615 --> 22:08.327
Perhaps I can save
months of investigating.

22:08.410 --> 22:13.791
Who has been trying to chisel Voltron
away from me this entire time?

22:13.874 --> 22:18.504
Who sent his fleet out
without my orders to get Voltron?

22:18.587 --> 22:20.756
Sire, no!

22:20.840 --> 22:23.175
I-I would never do that.

22:23.592 --> 22:27.888
-[Zarkon] Get rid of him.
-No! I'm innocent!

22:27.972 --> 22:33.185
Before we dispose of him, the druids
will find out all that he knows.

22:33.269 --> 22:37.106
Then, he will receive a punishment
worse than death.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.608
Lieutenant Thace...

22:40.568 --> 22:44.405
You are now in charge
of the investigation...

22:44.488 --> 22:46.574
Commander.

22:46.657 --> 22:48.117
<i>Vrepit sa.</i>
