asked if he knows
how to swim.

19:24.496 --> 19:25.873
- Maybe it was an abstract
question like...

19:25.956 --> 19:28.834
"To be or not to be."

19:28.917 --> 19:31.003
Do I or do I not
know how to swim?

19:31.086 --> 19:34.381
- You always cover for him.
But I'm a journalist.

19:34.464 --> 19:37.175
- You know that repeating it
doesn't make it true.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.804
- Something's going on
with Daniel

19:40.888 --> 19:43.515
and I'm gonna find out what.

19:45.475 --> 19:46.894
- That was a close call.
- Yeah.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.937
For a minute,
I thought you were doomed.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.441
Whoa! Don't you guys knock?

19:52.524 --> 19:56.153
- Why is the short human here
again?

19:56.236 --> 19:58.280
- She's the Chosen One's
sidekick.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.032
- But who you callin'
a sidekick?

20:00.115 --> 20:03.118
But, um...
[clears throat] Yeah.

20:03.201 --> 20:04.578
- Why are you here?

20:04.661 --> 20:06.288
- Well, we just
wanted to see

20:06.371 --> 20:08.206
how you were coping with
the Fool Moon.

20:08.290 --> 20:09.666
It can affect the Chosen One
more than others.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.836
- And you wanted to see if I've
decided to break up with Daniel.

20:12.920 --> 20:15.839
- Well, only if you have to.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.966
If, hypothetically,
he got amnesia,

20:18.050 --> 20:19.885
doesn't remember you--
EMMA: He does!

20:19.968 --> 20:22.429
He remembers everything
and so do I.

20:22.512 --> 20:26.099
I remember who helped me
and who didn't

20:26.183 --> 20:28.060
when Daniel got amnesia.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.269
Hypothetically.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.563
- Are they talking
in some type of code?

20:31.647 --> 20:34.483
- No. I haven't decided.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.901
But I do wanna say
that I think

20:35.984 --> 20:38.487
this is totally unfair.

20:38.570 --> 20:39.905
Things should be fair.

20:39.988 --> 20:42.115
Maybe that's something
witches don't value,

20:42.199 --> 20:44.576
but humans do.
- Yeah, we do.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.497
- Aye. Desdemona,
what do you think?

20:48.580 --> 20:51.458
- Maybe we should take
her opinion into account.

20:51.541 --> 20:54.920
She is the Chosen One--
a courageous one.

20:55.003 --> 20:57.172
- Yes, my thoughts exactly.

20:57.255 --> 21:00.217
Wait! What did you say?

21:00.300 --> 21:03.553
- I mean, do what you
think is fit.

21:03.637 --> 21:06.640
- Ah.
- Agreed.

21:06.723 --> 21:09.434
- Emma Alonso, you have until
the end of the Fool Moon.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.355
Give up the human
or lose your powers forever.

21:13.438 --> 21:15.399
- Lily?

21:15.482 --> 21:16.525
- [coughing]
Traitor!

21:16.608 --> 21:20.654
- Now for your punishment.
- Not so fast!

21:20.737 --> 21:23.240
Whatever you do to Emma,
you have to do to me, too.

21:23.323 --> 21:24.741
- Not a problem.
- Wait!
