Season07 Episode06

00:11.130 --> 00:13.440
*******

00:13.450 --> 00:16.190
Without you, Sangala has no leader.

00:16.200 --> 00:19.690
These people, they work
for Duba, don't they?

00:19.700 --> 00:23.010
Mr Matobo, we've accessed the
air intake to your safe room.

00:23.050 --> 00:25.440
We are feeding in
ammonium dysterate gas.

00:25.480 --> 00:28.270
–If you will die.
–Ule…

00:33.970 --> 00:36.770
get him out of there!
Get the woman, too.

00:36.780 --> 00:38.340
–Mr Taylor.
–Sam.

00:38.350 --> 00:39.450
I can't stay long.

00:39.490 --> 00:42.730
They killed Roger and made
it look like a suicide.

00:42.770 --> 00:44.090
Who are they?

00:44.100 --> 00:45.020
I don't know who they are.

00:45.060 --> 00:47.220
They just said that they would
kill me if I said anything.

00:47.260 --> 00:50.550
Roger was tasked with auditing
the brokers in his department.

00:50.590 --> 00:51.970
It's all here.

00:51.990 --> 00:55.740
Account numbers, trading
records, everything that he knew.

00:55.780 --> 00:59.090
Roger was looking into
things he shouldn't have.

00:59.840 --> 01:02.660
You killed my son.

01:03.910 --> 01:05.830
It's tetradyzine, sir.

01:05.850 --> 01:08.670
It's a neuromuscular paralytic.

01:10.390 --> 01:13.170
The situation here is in control.
Are you tracking Ms Roth?

01:13.210 --> 01:14.500
Yeah.

01:14.510 --> 01:17.018
Time to get her back to her apartment.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.030
Ms Roth. Henry Taylor sent me.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.390
Mr Taylor's been looking
into the matter you discussed.

01:22.430 --> 01:25.100
He believes you're in imminent danger.

01:25.110 --> 01:28.212
He wants me to place you
in protective custody.

01:30.700 --> 01:31.450
Larry, it's Renee.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.880
I've got a visual on them loading
Matobo and his wife into a truck.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.090
Where the hell is swat?

01:35.130 --> 01:36.130
They're still about five minutes out.

01:36.170 --> 01:37.480
Drop the gun.

01:37.490 --> 01:39.900
Far as I can tell, she's alone.

01:39.910 --> 01:42.420
Damn you, Bauer, you son of a bitch.

01:43.400 --> 01:46.950
Nichols wants her out of the
way before we deliver Matobo.

01:46.990 --> 01:49.220
–Come on.
–Yeah.

01:49.230 --> 01:50.880
Turn around.

01:51.210 --> 01:54.340
Trust me I'll get you through this alive.

02:05.390 --> 02:09.810
*********

02:10.880 --> 02:14.100
I want three more teams combing
the site where Matobo was abducted.

02:14.140 --> 02:15.850
Pull them in from
regional if you have to.

02:15.890 --> 02:16.900
We're going to expand the search.

02:16.940 --> 02:20.930
Coordinate with metro police to set up a
point-by-point grid
encompassing a ten-mile radius.

02:20.970 --> 02:21.920
And talk with NSA.

02:21.960 --> 02:23.890
I want to back all of this up
with synchronized satellite sweeps.

02:23.930 --> 02:25.830
I'll do what I can.

02:25.840 --> 02:26.520
What does that mean?

02:26.560 --> 02:30.230
Well, every time I ask for something,
they pull their cloak-and-dagger nonsense.

02:30.270 --> 02:32.090
I have to get approval for
every little scrap of data.

02:32.130 --> 02:35.430
Janis, this isn't easy for anybody.
Just, please, make it happen.

02:35.470 --> 02:37.440
Yes, sir.

02:38.300 --> 02:40.390
We know that another
attack could be imminent.

02:40.430 --> 02:46.238
The only way to stop it is to find Almeida
and Bauer and take control of the CIP device.

02:50.290 --> 02:56.240
for those of you who haven't heard,
Renee walker was abducted by these people.

03:00.510 --> 03:02.880
We're the only chance she's got.

03:04.550 --> 03:06.860
So, let's get to work.

03:10.290 --> 03:11.880
What have you got?

03:11.910 --> 03:15.144
–Audio forensics cleaned up the recording.
–Okay.

03:15.150 --> 03:17.530
Walker is extraneous.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.660
Kill her before you get here.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.760
Okay, we'll be with you soon.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.140
Be quick about it. Dubaku's anxious
to get his hands on the prime minister.

03:24.180 --> 03:26.430
Been combing through it, looking for
a tag that will give up their location.

03:26.470 --> 03:28.300
So far, nothing.

03:28.340 --> 03:31.112
Is there anybody else
you can put on this?

03:31.330 --> 03:32.570
Larry, I don't think it's worth it.

03:32.610 --> 03:33.500
There's nothing here.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.350
All right, fine, help
Janis coordinate with NSA.

03:35.390 --> 03:38.710
I'm sorry about Renee,
Larry. She was a good agent.

03:38.750 --> 03:41.510
We don't know that she's dead yet!

03:42.170 --> 03:44.490
All right?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.760
Are you sure this is it?

04:12.870 --> 04:16.329
–She's going to run out of air.
–Tony said near the backhoe.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.800
Here, here.

04:19.440 --> 04:21.450
I got her, Chloe. I got her.

04:24.700 --> 04:27.390
Alright, here she is. Here she is.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.244
She's not breathing.
Give me the adrenaline.

05:05.330 --> 05:09.050
It's all right. You're
okay… you're okay.

05:10.150 --> 05:11.870
Who are you?

05:12.120 --> 05:14.300
We're working with Jack.

05:14.310 --> 05:16.070
He told us where to find you.

05:16.110 --> 05:19.080
It's gonna be okay. Take deep breaths.

05:19.480 --> 05:21.670
You're gonna be okay.

05:29.500 --> 05:33.060
We're close to the rendezvous
point. What's your ETA?

05:36.930 --> 05:40.350
Good. We'll see you then.

05:49.010 --> 05:51.310
It's all set.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.430
Nichols is on his way with the diamonds.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.430
is something bothering you, Jack?

06:04.070 --> 06:05.950
No, I was wondering…

06:05.980 --> 06:09.346
why you never told Tony
how you got him out of CTU.

06:13.350 --> 06:15.850
How did you do it?

06:18.750 --> 06:21.330
Christopher Anderson.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.060
Christopher Anderson tried to kill him.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.840
Anderson had no intention of killing Tony.

06:27.160 --> 06:30.530
He purposely missed the
artery when he injected him.

06:30.570 --> 06:33.540
It was just enough to slow his heart to the
point where you'd think that he was dead.

06:33.580 --> 06:35.850
My job was to…

06:35.860 --> 06:39.190
extract and revive him and…

06:39.200 --> 06:41.800
use him against you.

06:42.730 --> 06:45.080
And?

06:45.850 --> 06:51.262
By the time I stabilized him, you had
already killed Anderson. Mission had failed.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.580
So, my team went dark.

06:53.590 --> 06:55.620
Why did he just let Tony go?

06:55.660 --> 06:59.130
Tony chose to stay with us.

07:03.270 --> 07:08.814
He was consumed with hatred and anger over
what the government had done to Michelle.

07:12.340 --> 07:15.950
Anyway… I talked to him.

07:18.160 --> 07:21.270
More importantly, I listened to him.

07:23.420 --> 07:27.970
Pretty soon, we came to
realize that… I was right.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.410
About what?

07:31.710 --> 07:34.530
That the rules had changed.

07:37.010 --> 07:41.130
And there was nothing
such as honor left.

07:45.070 --> 07:48.460
That we would have to
take care of each other.

07:51.890 --> 07:53.960
Like brothers.

07:53.970 --> 07:55.790
Mr Emerson.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.900
Yeah?

07:56.920 --> 07:58.960
We're almost there.

07:59.850 --> 08:02.390
How is the deal gonna go down?

08:02.400 --> 08:05.304
Don't worry, Jack.
You're about to find out.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.720
Are you ready?

08:24.090 --> 08:25.650
Yeah.

08:25.660 --> 08:27.330
Are you sure?

08:28.020 --> 08:29.740
Yeah.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.000
Go help Litvak with the door.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.160
–Go get the Matobos.
–Yeah.

09:12.870 --> 09:14.570
you better tell me what
the hell's going on.

09:14.610 --> 09:16.320
Drop the gun, David.

09:16.330 --> 09:18.490
You know, I just couldn't
figure out your play,

09:18.530 --> 09:21.550
so I tried to give you some
time so you'd come clean,

09:21.590 --> 09:23.730
'cause we are like
brothers, right, Tony?

09:23.770 --> 09:25.150
Put the gun down, David.

09:25.190 --> 09:28.400
You actually think that I would let
you steal those diamonds from me?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.300
It's not about the diamonds.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.940
It's about killing innocent people.

09:31.980 --> 09:33.830
I can't let you finish this.

09:33.840 --> 09:35.230
Take a shot.

09:35.250 --> 09:37.200
Put down the weapon or I will kill him.

09:37.240 --> 09:39.570
–Tony, take a shot!
–Shut up, Jack!

09:39.580 --> 09:41.670
–Put it down, Tony, or he's dead.
–David, I don't want to kill you, but I will.

09:41.710 --> 09:43.950
Damn it, Tony, drop the…

09:58.140 --> 09:59.940
–you okay?
–Yeah.

10:00.740 --> 10:02.210
David.

10:12.990 --> 10:15.130
Okay, you say that Bauer and
Almeida are working undercover,

10:15.170 --> 10:17.400
but CTU has been shut down, so, I mean,

10:17.440 --> 10:20.010
if you're telling the truth,
who's running this operation?

10:20.050 --> 10:22.640
We are. We're not
working with any agency.

10:22.680 --> 10:29.016
We believe there's been widespread infiltration
of the government by Dubaku and the Juma regime.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.590
Okay. I need to contact my boss.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.030
–He needs to know that I'm okay.
–You can't do that.

10:34.070 --> 10:37.000
–Why not?
–Dubaku has informants in the FBI.

10:37.010 --> 10:41.828
If they find out you're alive, they'll
know Jack is working against them.

10:41.830 --> 10:42.970
You don't know who you can trust.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.180
I can trust agent moss.

10:44.220 --> 10:47.850
You're not listening to me.
You cannot contact the FBI.

10:48.020 --> 10:50.440
You will jeopardize this operation,
and I won't let you do that.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.940
Well, I don't work for you; I work
for Larry. Now give me a phone.

10:52.980 --> 10:55.740
Sit still, please.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.310
We're nearing the endgame.

10:58.320 --> 11:03.370
Dubaku is the key to finding out who
in the government has been corrupted.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.910
Luckily, we have something he wants.

11:07.660 --> 11:09.790
Matobo.

11:10.070 --> 11:13.400
He's our best chance to locate
Dubaku, reacquire the CIP module

11:13.440 --> 11:15.290
and get to the bottom of
the government corruption.

11:15.330 --> 11:18.860
Until all that happens,
you have to stay dead.

11:21.020 --> 11:22.780
–yeah.
–Did you find agent walker?

11:22.820 --> 11:25.110
Yeah, we got her, Jack.
She's fine. Where are you?

11:25.150 --> 11:28.640
Northwoods airfield. Litvak is dead.
Emerson's been wounded. Nichols is en route.

11:28.680 --> 11:30.510
I need you to get over here now.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.040
–Have you talked to Matobo?
–Not yet.

11:32.080 --> 11:34.620
He needs to agree to this,
Jack. We can't do it without him.

11:34.660 --> 11:37.432
I'll get him to agree.
Just get over here.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.730
it's all right.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.340
What the hell is going on?

11:51.890 --> 11:54.610
Mr Matobo, I'm not going
to hurt you or your wife.

11:54.650 --> 11:58.350
I know how scared you are and I know what
you've been through, but we are here to help you.

11:58.390 --> 12:01.090
What in God's name are you
talking about? You kidnapped us.

12:01.130 --> 12:03.240
We had to to gain Dubaku's trust.

12:03.280 --> 12:06.778
That's the man we're after.
We're trying to stop him.

12:07.230 --> 12:08.430
I want to call my people.

12:08.470 --> 12:11.210
I can't let you do that,
not until you hear me out.

12:11.250 --> 12:14.470
Sir, we have a plan to stop Dubaku,
but we can't do it without your help.

12:14.510 --> 12:16.410
We don't have much time.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.170
Please. Come with me.

12:22.780 --> 12:24.580
Mr Dubaku.

12:26.550 --> 12:29.550
I'm heading to the meeting place.
They're bringing Matobo now.

12:29.590 --> 12:31.830
–And his wife?
–Both of them.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.220
Once you have Matobo,
you know what to do.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.890
Emerson's team is now
a loose end. Tie it off.

12:37.930 --> 12:40.100
Are you sure about this?

12:40.110 --> 12:43.150
We may need their services again.

12:43.480 --> 12:49.000
I would rather keep my diamonds, and
Almeida has proved to be a liability.

12:50.700 --> 12:54.080
So. Any response from the White House?

12:54.090 --> 12:55.700
Not the one we wanted.

12:55.730 --> 12:58.550
American forces are still in position.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.950
President Taylor must
know we have Matobo.

13:00.990 --> 13:03.440
She can't attack Sangala without him.

13:03.460 --> 13:05.680
The country will collapse.

13:05.690 --> 13:10.300
Taylor may be holding out hope that
she can somehow retrieve Matobo.

13:10.310 --> 13:14.468
Or she doesn't believe we are
willing to carry out our threats.

13:15.080 --> 13:18.260
She will only respond when
there are dead Americans.

13:18.300 --> 13:19.910
I'll call you when I have Matobo.

13:19.950 --> 13:22.940
These gentlemen are at your command.

13:28.710 --> 13:31.770
There are still 1,300 planes in the air.

13:31.800 --> 13:34.044
Which region do you want targeted?

13:36.220 --> 13:38.830
Washington, DC.

13:56.360 --> 13:58.940
Yeah. Yeah.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.640
I understand, Bob.

14:01.910 --> 14:03.970
All right, thanks.

14:04.360 --> 14:06.920
That was Bob Cornell at NSA.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.230
They've detected
another firewall breach.

14:09.270 --> 14:10.410
There's been another attack?

14:10.450 --> 14:13.920
Not yet, but they believe the
CIP device is being utilized.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.610
We have to assume Dubaku is
initiating another attack.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.270
It's safe to say this won't
be another warning shot.

14:20.310 --> 14:23.676
This time Dubaku's gonna
make sure that people die.

14:26.110 --> 14:30.970
I want to speak personally with all
first responders across the country.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.630
They need to know to brace for the worst
and that they have our full support.

14:34.670 --> 14:40.940
Instead of preparing for it, maybe we should be
trying to preempt this attack, madam president.

14:41.020 --> 14:46.020
The deadline Dubaku gave us for withdrawing
our troops from Sangala has passed,

14:46.060 --> 14:48.250
but if we made some kind of gesture…

14:48.290 --> 14:52.330
began an immediate pullback, it might
keep Dubaku from pulling the trigger.

14:52.370 --> 14:55.420
We've discussed this,
Ethan. It's not an option.

14:55.460 --> 14:57.800
I won't be dictated to by this madman.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.810
Madam president, we can't
invade Sangala without Matobo,

15:01.820 --> 15:05.300
and there's very little
chance of him being recovered.

15:05.340 --> 15:07.430
Why are we risking American lives?

15:07.470 --> 15:10.110
I've told you my reasons.

15:10.130 --> 15:14.890
I implore you: withdraw
our forces before it's too late.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.530
You asked me to be your advisor
because you trust my opinion.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.710
Well, I'm giving it to you now.

15:21.730 --> 15:24.560
–We're out of options.
–We're not, Ethan.

15:24.570 --> 15:29.810
The NSA is attempting to localize what part
of the infrastructure is being targeted,

15:29.850 --> 15:34.340
and the FBI is still trying
to track down the CIP device.

15:38.250 --> 15:41.280
I'll keep an open channel
with both agencies.

15:41.290 --> 15:43.600
–I'll keep you apprised.
–Good.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.650
Let me see it. Let me see it!

16:01.210 --> 16:03.830
This wasn't about the diamonds, David.

16:04.120 --> 16:07.090
You crossed a line I
wasn't willing to cross.

16:08.690 --> 16:10.930
I'm sorry.

16:11.270 --> 16:13.770
You're looking for forgiveness…

16:15.790 --> 16:18.150
go to hell.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.490
You… live with it.

16:28.220 --> 16:32.280
You're asking us to risk our lives
to be delivered into Dubaku's hands,

16:32.320 --> 16:34.560
based on nothing but
what you have told us.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.170
Everything I have told you is the truth.

16:36.210 --> 16:39.010
Dubaku is in this country,
and we need to find him.

16:39.050 --> 16:40.450
You have as much at stake as we do.

16:40.490 --> 16:42.340
He's attacked both our countries.

16:42.380 --> 16:44.310
Listen to him, Ule.

16:44.350 --> 16:48.720
You told me yourself president Taylor
will not commit forces to Sangala

16:48.760 --> 16:51.070
until these attacks are stopped.

16:51.090 --> 16:53.310
But how can we trust this man?

16:53.340 --> 16:56.080
Because he has no reason to lie.

17:03.880 --> 17:07.280
I will do what you ask,
but I will go alone.

17:07.290 --> 17:09.530
Dubaku wants you and your
wife. That's the deal.

17:09.569 --> 17:13.109
No. I will not put my wife
in the hands of that monster.

17:13.150 --> 17:15.890
I will be honest with you, sir.
He wants your wife as leverage.

17:15.930 --> 17:18.700
If I don't deliver both
of you, he will back out.

17:18.740 --> 17:19.950
Leverage.

17:19.970 --> 17:23.819
You mean he wants to torture her to make me tell
him what I know about the resistance in Sangala?

17:23.859 --> 17:27.790
Yes, sir. And we won't let that
happen. We'll be following you.

17:27.829 --> 17:31.922
Still, you can't promise me that
she won't be harmed, can you?

17:32.490 --> 17:34.780
Can you?

17:37.320 --> 17:39.870
I won't do it.

17:40.600 --> 17:42.800
May I speak with my husband?

17:42.810 --> 17:44.850
Of course, ma'am.

17:47.610 --> 17:49.656
–I want to do this, Ule.
–What?

17:49.660 --> 17:53.230
I am ashamed that I opened
the door to the safe room.

17:53.600 --> 17:56.230
I want to do what is
right for our country.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.670
Absolutely not.

17:57.700 --> 18:00.200
You can't stop me, Ule.

18:00.610 --> 18:03.340
Sangala is my country, too.

18:03.590 --> 18:07.510
I have been by your side for 22 years.

18:07.770 --> 18:10.670
I am not going to leave it now.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.690
Mr Bauer.

18:26.600 --> 18:28.940
We will do this together.

18:29.460 --> 18:31.330
Thank you.

18:31.350 --> 18:33.760
You are both very brave.

18:33.770 --> 18:36.938
We'll need to go soon.
Excuse me for one moment.

18:46.370 --> 18:48.260
Tony.

18:48.280 --> 18:51.712
The Matobos are gonna work
with us. We've got to go.

18:57.310 --> 18:59.380
Tony.

19:07.510 --> 19:11.700
Let's get the bodies out of sight.

19:20.820 --> 19:22.540
We're locked onto the FAA node.

19:22.580 --> 19:25.180
Begin rerouting the targets.

19:26.290 --> 19:31.570
RSA 471, turn right, heading 274.

19:31.580 --> 19:35.020
Descend and maintain flight level 270.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.070
Call the white house.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.160
The latest report from the NSA.

19:47.170 --> 19:49.680
–I can summarize it for you.
–Go ahead.

19:49.720 --> 19:53.380
They've had no luck in
localizing the firewall breach.

19:53.390 --> 19:55.870
Dubaku's attack could hit anywhere.

19:55.890 --> 19:58.170
What about the FBI?

19:58.750 --> 20:03.650
they've dedicated every available
agent to the manhunt for Matobo.

20:03.660 --> 20:05.410
They're no closer to finding him.

20:05.450 --> 20:07.180
Uh, excuse me.

20:09.590 --> 20:12.130
We're at a dead end, madam president.

20:12.140 --> 20:15.380
You need to order the pullback,
and you need to order it now.

20:15.420 --> 20:17.040
Can it be traced?

20:18.170 --> 20:19.980
Okay. Hold on.

20:20.260 --> 20:21.180
Madam president.

20:21.220 --> 20:22.410
What is it, Tim?

20:22.430 --> 20:24.880
I've just been forwarded
a scrambled call.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.570
It's from colonel Dubaku.

20:26.580 --> 20:28.830
He's demanding to speak with you.

20:33.110 --> 20:34.910
I'll take it.

20:39.750 --> 20:41.210
This is president Taylor.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.140
Madam president…

20:43.460 --> 20:47.250
I'm disappointed that you have
not taken my demands seriously.

20:47.290 --> 20:50.100
Your forces are still in
position near my country.

20:50.140 --> 20:55.490
Colonel Dubaku, I assure you we've had very
serious discussions regarding your demands.

20:55.530 --> 20:57.940
The time for discussions is over.

20:58.860 --> 21:03.140
The deadline for your forces to
begin their withdrawal has passed.

21:03.180 --> 21:04.740
Go to the window.

21:04.750 --> 21:07.460
Look to the southwest, madam president.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.410
What?

21:09.420 --> 21:11.650
See what you have done.

21:11.660 --> 21:15.400
Colonel Dubaku, if you're
endangering one American life…

21:15.410 --> 21:16.540
oh, my God.

21:16.560 --> 21:19.770
Go, madam president.

21:29.190 --> 21:31.090
You son of a bitch.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.674
Comply with my demands within the hour,

21:33.870 --> 21:36.980
or 10,000 more Americans will die.

22:11.600 --> 22:14.160
Is the cabinet still assembled?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.480
Yes, madam president.

22:41.830 --> 22:43.390
Was flight 131 out of Chicago.

22:43.430 --> 22:46.280
240 passengers, ten crew members.

22:46.290 --> 22:49.280
They collided with a small
commuter jet carrying 21 people.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.690
There's also a high probability
of casualties on the ground.

22:52.730 --> 22:57.350
The aircraft went down in a residential
neighborhood near Edgeborough.

22:58.330 --> 22:59.750
Thank you.

23:06.420 --> 23:11.050
we've also just gotten word that congressman
brighten and his wife may have been on 131.

23:11.090 --> 23:12.130
We're waiting for confirmation.

23:12.170 --> 23:14.180
How many planes are still in the air?

23:14.220 --> 23:16.440
Over 1,300.

23:16.450 --> 23:19.950
Madam president, this is a
catastrophic loss of American lives,

23:19.990 --> 23:20.720
and it's only going to get worse.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.180
We have to withdraw our forces
before the next deadline.

23:23.220 --> 23:25.662
I'm forced to agree, madam president.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.650
Go ahead, Tim. I want
to hear what you think.

23:35.660 --> 23:40.940
We're simply not prepared to contend with
the scope of damage these people can inflict.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.570
The tragedy we've just witnessed is
nothing compared to what could happen

23:43.610 --> 23:46.190
if they begin targeting
more sensitive installations:

23:46.230 --> 23:49.070
Power grids, nuclear facilities.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.920
We're talking deaths in
the hundreds of thousands.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.490
All in support of a policy that
cannot possibly succeed without Matobo.

23:55.530 --> 23:57.350
He's the only man who
can stabilize Sangala.

23:57.390 --> 24:00.770
Without him, the entire
operation is pointless.

24:11.460 --> 24:16.580
There's still a chance that prime
minister Matobo will be recovered.

24:16.590 --> 24:20.830
And while that chance
exists, I'm not giving in.

24:20.840 --> 24:25.220
Admiral smith, your strike force will remain
in position and at full battle readiness.

24:25.260 --> 24:26.230
Yes, madam president.

24:26.270 --> 24:28.980
Madam president, you're guaranteeing
another attack on our country.

24:29.020 --> 24:32.780
We will not be blackmailed, Joe, and
we will not be held hostage.

24:32.820 --> 24:34.970
This country does not
negotiate with terrorists.

24:35.010 --> 24:37.610
Tell that to the families of the dead!

24:37.740 --> 24:39.320
Do you have any idea what
the public reaction will be

24:39.360 --> 24:41.570
when word gets out that
these are acts of terrorism?

24:41.610 --> 24:43.200
Brought about by your
reckless foreign policy?

24:43.240 --> 24:45.620
I can guarantee there will be
a call for your impeachment…

24:45.660 --> 24:47.910
–that's enough, Joe.
–I will not stand by and let this happen.

24:47.950 --> 24:53.032
Then you can turn in your
resignation, Joe, because
I'm not changing my mind.

24:53.340 --> 24:56.400
Now sit down or leave.

25:07.960 --> 25:10.030
I'm sorry, madam president.

25:11.810 --> 25:14.846
You people think about
what you're doing here…

25:15.050 --> 25:17.510
about the cost you're willing to pay.

25:38.430 --> 25:42.040
Gentlemen, ladies…

25:44.310 --> 25:49.062
I know that there are many of you
here who agree with secretary Stevens.

25:50.740 --> 25:53.440
If I can't alleviate your doubts,

25:53.810 --> 25:57.410
I can at least help you
to understand my reasoning.

26:00.550 --> 26:05.630
When I took the oath of office, I swore
to myself, and to the American people,

26:05.670 --> 26:10.620
that this country would continue to
be a force for good in this world.

26:11.780 --> 26:14.490
We're a nation founded on ideals,

26:15.130 --> 26:19.410
and those ideals are
being challenged today.

26:21.040 --> 26:28.470
Now how we respond will not only define
this administration, but an entire generation.

26:29.710 --> 26:33.560
And not just Americans, but Sangalans,

26:33.570 --> 26:38.750
and anyone else who looks to
us for guidance and strength.

26:41.150 --> 26:43.800
I won't fail them…

26:45.460 --> 26:48.210
and neither will you.

26:54.310 --> 26:57.840
we're in for some tough times ahead.

26:58.760 --> 27:01.040
Let's make sure we're ready.

27:09.930 --> 27:12.080
Thank you, everyone.

28:07.190 --> 28:09.010
–Hey, Jack.
–They're over there.

28:09.050 --> 28:11.440
I want you to put a wire on
Mr Matobo as fast as you can.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.560
Go.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.040
You okay?

28:21.120 --> 28:23.070
What do you think, Jack?

28:23.080 --> 28:25.530
You shot me and buried me alive.

28:25.540 --> 28:27.940
If we hadn't, Emerson
would have killed you.

28:27.980 --> 28:30.310
I'm sorry we had to keep you in the
dark, but we didn't have a choice.

28:30.350 --> 28:31.910
Yes, you did.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.430
You could have trusted me.

28:35.240 --> 28:40.058
If I had told you everything back at
the FBI, would you have believed me?

28:54.070 --> 28:55.980
Have a seat, please, sir.

29:09.030 --> 29:10.490
What's that?

29:11.320 --> 29:15.346
It's a transmitter. I'll be
affixing it to one of your teeth.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.670
We'll know exactly where
you are at all times.

29:17.710 --> 29:19.350
You won't be alone.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.300
Are you with the FBI?

29:21.310 --> 29:23.760
No, I'm a
stay-at-home mom.

29:23.770 --> 29:25.460
Open your mouth, please.

29:26.910 --> 29:29.190
Wider. Good.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.560
Chloe accessed the FBI server.

29:31.960 --> 29:34.700
Dubaku brought down two planes
just outside the capital.

29:34.740 --> 29:37.210
Over 270 people were killed.

29:37.670 --> 29:39.700
He's threatened to kill 10,000 more.

29:39.740 --> 29:41.130
We have less than an hour to stop it.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.030
–How long before Nichols gets here?
–Ten minutes.

29:43.070 --> 29:44.520
Here's your com.

29:44.530 --> 29:45.830
Thanks.

29:56.650 --> 29:58.200
You all right?

29:58.210 --> 29:59.520
Yeah, just a little dizzy.

29:59.560 --> 30:01.510
–You should take a seat.
–I'm fine.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.940
Hey, come on.

30:03.950 --> 30:05.730
Take a seat.

30:08.870 --> 30:11.050
So it's really true?

30:11.060 --> 30:12.810
Yeah.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.540
I've devoted my life to the bureau
and you just expect me to believe

30:15.580 --> 30:18.320
that it's corrupted—that the
entire government's been corrupted?

30:18.360 --> 30:19.850
Not all of them.

30:19.870 --> 30:22.790
But until we find out
who, we can't trust anyone.

30:22.830 --> 30:25.330
And the four of you really
think you can stop this?

30:25.370 --> 30:26.660
We have to.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.820
It's as simple as that.

30:33.770 --> 30:35.150
Ethan…

30:35.420 --> 30:37.070
can we…

30:40.980 --> 30:42.410
The president is
completely alone on this,

30:42.450 --> 30:44.800
and she's going to get a
lot of Americans killed.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.630
You've got to find a way
to talk some sense into her.

30:46.670 --> 30:49.650
We're both on the same side here, Tim.

30:49.660 --> 30:52.530
And I'm going to need your help
if we're going to change her mind.

30:52.570 --> 30:54.550
How do you propose we do that?

30:54.950 --> 30:57.310
There is someone she'll listen to.

30:57.320 --> 31:00.500
Maybe we can convince him to help us.

31:52.800 --> 31:54.290
–go ahead.
–I just dropped her off.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.020
She's on her way up.

31:56.280 --> 31:58.020
Okay, stay in the car and keep watch.

31:58.060 --> 31:59.974
I'll call you when it's done.

32:53.910 --> 32:56.360
Mr Taylor, how did you get in here?

32:59.990 --> 33:04.478
the agent you sent just brought me
by to get a few of my things for…

33:09.610 --> 33:11.530
Mr Taylor, are you all right?

33:16.090 --> 33:17.674
Mr Taylor, are you okay?

33:22.470 --> 33:26.562
Mr Taylor, unless you tell me
what's wrong, I don't know what…

33:31.870 --> 33:33.160
help me.

33:33.170 --> 33:34.730
help me. Please.

33:58.910 --> 34:00.090
yes, Mr Kanin.

34:00.100 --> 34:02.360
Agent Gedge, I'm looking
for Henry Taylor.

34:02.400 --> 34:04.980
He's not answering his
phone. Is he with you?

34:05.020 --> 34:07.000
You can't talk with him right now, sir.

34:07.040 --> 34:08.920
Why not? Where is he?

34:08.929 --> 34:11.780
Well, he's meeting with Samantha
Roth in her apartment, sir.

34:11.820 --> 34:14.239
For what possible reason?

34:14.250 --> 34:16.692
I don't know, sir. He didn't tell me.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.800
Why aren't you with him?

34:18.810 --> 34:21.070
Mr Taylor insisted on
meeting with her alone, sir.

34:21.110 --> 34:23.929
I'm in the car. I'm just
outside the building.

34:23.969 --> 34:25.690
I don't give a damn what he insisted.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.150
We went through this, agent Gedge.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.250
You were supposed to
keep him away from her.

34:29.290 --> 34:30.620
What the hell were you thinking?

34:30.659 --> 34:32.060
I'm sorry, sir.

34:32.070 --> 34:33.570
I'm not interested in your apology.

34:33.610 --> 34:38.164
Just pull him out of there and have
him phone me as soon as possible.

35:07.230 --> 35:08.960
Don't try to speak, sir.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.018
There's nothing left to say.

35:42.460 --> 35:44.400
We will wait here.

35:45.150 --> 35:46.870
All right.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.630
They're coming. One car
from the service road.

35:56.670 --> 35:57.940
How many people?

35:57.950 --> 35:59.560
I can't tell. The windows are tinted.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.120
Copy that.

36:26.140 --> 36:28.040
How are you doing, Tony?

36:29.010 --> 36:30.550
All right.

36:31.610 --> 36:34.250
I was glad to hear you're still with us.

36:34.330 --> 36:36.520
Where's Emerson?

36:36.530 --> 36:39.120
You're not going to be
dealing with him today.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.830
What do you mean?

36:40.850 --> 36:42.410
He's dead.

36:42.420 --> 36:44.850
So's Litvak and Bauer.

36:45.070 --> 36:48.030
I got them in a back
room. You want to say hi?

36:48.070 --> 36:51.634
You better start telling me
what the hell is going on.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.660
I decided I'd rather not split the cut.

36:56.260 --> 36:59.280
I don't understand. I thought
you and Emerson were friends

36:59.320 --> 37:02.818
yeah, that was before he
left me to rot with the FBI.

37:07.730 --> 37:09.340
You want Matobo or not?

37:09.350 --> 37:11.020
–Where is he?
–Close.

37:11.030 --> 37:14.390
I want to see him, and his wife.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.160
Diamonds.

37:47.680 --> 37:49.290
Matobo.

37:52.380 --> 37:54.360
He's in the back of the truck.

38:11.730 --> 38:12.920
Keep your tracks clean.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.742
We might call on you again.

38:39.190 --> 38:40.870
okay, then.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.590
Let's put that behind us.

38:46.170 --> 38:48.140
You got what you want.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.340
Now, get the hell out of here.

38:50.810 --> 38:52.630
Now!

39:32.920 --> 39:34.380
clear.

39:34.390 --> 39:36.460
–Chloe.
–Jack, I've got him.

39:36.470 --> 39:38.516
Get everyone ready to move out.

40:12.210 --> 40:13.910
Gedge…

40:36.700 --> 40:38.260
Gedge.

40:40.200 --> 40:41.910
Don't do this.

40:57.070 --> 40:58.590
Please…

42:08.030 --> 42:10.230
the white house still has not complied.

42:10.270 --> 42:12.850
American force are still in position.

42:13.270 --> 42:17.520
I think this president is not
just stubborn; she's insane.

42:17.530 --> 42:19.290
What do you intend to do?

42:19.300 --> 42:20.710
Exactly what we promised.

42:20.750 --> 42:22.690
We're ready, sir.

42:22.700 --> 42:24.960
I'll see you in a moment.

42:27.970 --> 42:29.650
Where is the target located?

42:29.690 --> 42:31.020
Kidron, Ohio.

42:31.030 --> 42:33.480
–Population?
–30000

42:33.490 --> 42:37.260
The processing facility is located
two miles west of the town center.

42:37.300 --> 42:40.290
Casualties will be high, about 18,000.

42:47.370 --> 42:49.460
Begin.

42:49.470 --> 42:53.250
