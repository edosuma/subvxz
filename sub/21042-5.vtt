WEBVTT

00:08.909 --> 00:11.745
NARRATOR: IN THE DEEP FUTURE
YOU HAVE MERGED WITH AI.

00:12.280 --> 00:14.315
YOU CAN COMMUNICATE
TELEPATHICALLY.

00:14.348 --> 00:17.151
YOU CAN EVEN CHOOSE TO
LIVE INSIDE YOUR COMPUTER

00:17.185 --> 00:18.986
IF YOU WANT TO.

00:19.019 --> 00:22.190
AND WHILE TECHNOLOGY WILL BRING
EXTRAORDINARY AND UNIMAGINABLE

00:22.223 --> 00:24.392
ADVANCES TO THE EVOLUTION
OF THE HUMAN BODY,

00:25.426 --> 00:28.396
NANOBOTS WON'T BE WHAT PROTECTS
YOU FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF

00:28.429 --> 00:30.764
ACCELERATED GLOBAL WARMING.

00:31.899 --> 00:34.568
NOR CAN IT PROTECT YOU FROM AN
EXTINCTION EVENT LIKE THIS ONE.

00:36.637 --> 00:39.607
THE ONLY WAY TO TRULY ENSURE
HUMANITY'S SURVIVAL IS TO

00:39.640 --> 00:41.909
IMAGINE A
COURSE WHERE WE EVOLVE AS

00:41.942 --> 00:44.378
AN INTERPLANETARY SPECIES.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.915
THIS IS THE STORY OF HOW WE
PIONEER THE TECH THAT WILL

00:47.948 --> 00:50.451
BRING US TO OUTER SPACE.

00:57.925 --> 01:01.028
IT'S THE DEEP FUTURE.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.231
YOUR BODY, GONE.

01:03.264 --> 01:07.235
YOU'RE ALL COMPUTER,
ALL THE TIME.

01:07.268 --> 01:08.902
YOUR BRAIN IS WAY
MORE POWERFUL THAN

01:08.936 --> 01:11.172
EVEN A BILLION
SUPERCOMPUTERS.

01:13.006 --> 01:16.977
JOBS, FOOD, LANGUAGE, WATER,
EVEN TRADITIONAL THOUGHT,

01:18.446 --> 01:21.315
ALL OF HUMANITY'S BUILDING
BLOCKS, ALL THAT'S DONE.

01:22.483 --> 01:24.585
AND YOU ARE IMMORTAL.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.155
SQUIRMING IN YOUR CHAIR YET?

01:27.188 --> 01:28.622
YOU SHOULD BE.

01:28.656 --> 01:30.591
THIS ISN'T SCIENCE FICTION.

01:30.624 --> 01:34.262
TODAY'S VISIONARY THINKERS SAY
IT'S A STRONG PROBABILITY THAT

01:34.295 --> 01:36.930
THIS IS WHAT YOUR WORLD
IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE.

01:37.831 --> 01:40.901
TONIGHT, THEY'LL GUIDE YOU
TOWARD THAT SPECTACULAR FUTURE,

01:40.934 --> 01:43.171
AND WE'LL SEE HOW ONE
FAMILY NAVIGATES IT,

01:43.204 --> 01:45.673
ONE INVENTION AT A TIME.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.942
THIS IS THE STORY
OF YOUR FUTURE.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.812
THIS IS THE ROAD
TO YEAR MILLION.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.788
THE YEAR MILLION:
A FUTURE PERIOD,

02:00.821 --> 02:02.856
NOT EXACTLY A MILLION
YEARS FROM NOW,

02:02.890 --> 02:06.327
BUT RATHER A TIME WHEN
MAN AND SOCIETY WILL BE SO

02:06.360 --> 02:09.497
TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED, IT'S
NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE.

02:11.031 --> 02:13.701
MICHIO KAKU: IT STRETCHES THE
IMAGINATION TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT

02:13.734 --> 02:16.537
THE LAWS OF PHYSICS WILL ALLOW
A MILLION YEARS FROM NOW.

02:17.838 --> 02:19.673
NARRATOR: LET ME PUT
IT TO YOU THIS WAY.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.443
YOUR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE WILL
SURPASS ANYTHING YOU'VE SEEN ON

02:22.476 --> 02:24.144
STAR TREK.

02:24.178 --> 02:26.280
IN THIS FAR-OFF TIME,

02:26.314 --> 02:28.816
EARTH IS JUST ONE OF THE
PLANET'S WE'LL INHABIT.

02:29.850 --> 02:31.319
PETER DIAMANDIS:
STEPHEN HAWKING SAID,

02:31.352 --> 02:34.255
I DON'T THINK HUMANITY HAS A
FUTURE UNLESS WE GO INTO SPACE.

02:34.822 --> 02:37.958
THE DANGER FROM NUCLEAR
WAR OR ASTEROID STRIKE,

02:37.991 --> 02:40.528
OR EXISTENTIAL THREATS
OF THOSE TYPES, YOU KNOW,

02:40.561 --> 02:42.029
ALL OF OUR EGGS
ARE IN ONE BASKET.

02:42.062 --> 02:44.632
WE NEED TO DIVERSIFY.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.236
NARRATOR: AND DIVERSIFY MEANS
WE MUST ADAPT OR WE WILL DIE.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.539
BARATUNDE THURSTON: YOU KNOW,
THE PLANET'S KIND OF FALLING

02:51.572 --> 02:53.674
APART, WE'RE DYING, LIKE
DISEASE, ANTIBIOTICS,

02:53.707 --> 02:56.677
ALL THIS STUFF IS NOT
GOING THE GREATEST.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.179
NEGIN FARSAD: THERE'S A BUNCH OF
PEOPLE WHO HAVE THEIR FINGER ON

02:59.213 --> 03:02.583
THE NUCLEAR CODES AND THEY
ARE VERY DANGEROUS PEOPLE SO A

03:02.616 --> 03:07.187
NUCLEAR HOLOCAUST SEEMS LIKE A
REALLY LIKE POSSIBLE REASON THAT

03:07.221 --> 03:08.622
WE'D HAVE TO LEAVE EARTH.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.825
NARRATOR: BUT TO
GET OFF THE PLANET,

03:11.859 --> 03:14.728
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO
GET TO SPACE AND FAST.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.332
THAT IS GOING TO REQUIRE
COLLABORATION ON A GLOBAL SCALE,

03:18.366 --> 03:20.868
THE LIKES OF WHICH WE
HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.438
WITH EARTH BUCKLING UNDER
AN EXPLODING POPULATION AND

03:24.472 --> 03:27.375
ENORMOUS ENERGY DEMANDS, TAKE
COMFORT THAT THE SEEDS OF A

03:27.408 --> 03:30.944
REVOLUTION ARE SPROUTING A
PARADIGM SHIFT IN HOW WE CARE

03:30.978 --> 03:32.946
FOR OUR PLANET.

03:32.980 --> 03:35.249
WE'RE ALSO LOOKING
TOWARD THE HEAVENS,

03:35.283 --> 03:38.252
BREATHING NEW LIFE AND
A TON OF MONEY INTO AN

03:38.286 --> 03:40.187
AMPED UP SPACE RACE

03:40.220 --> 03:42.590
LED BY AN ADVENTUROUS
BREED OF BILLIONAIRE SPACE

03:42.623 --> 03:45.926
PIONEERS WHO ALL WANT TO BE
THE FIRST TO PLANT THEIR FLAG

03:45.959 --> 03:48.596
ON MARS AND WORLD'S BEYOND.

03:49.597 --> 03:52.132
IT'S ABOUT SURVIVAL
AT ALL COSTS,

03:52.600 --> 03:55.969
WHETHER IT'S ON THE
PLANET OR OFF-WORLD.

03:56.003 --> 04:00.173
SO LET ME SHOW YOU THE ROAD
TO HUMANITY'S SURVIVAL.

04:01.409 --> 04:04.578
FIRST, WE'LL NEED TO BUY TIME.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.815
OUR WORLD IS FULL OF STUFF,
BUT IN THE FUTURE OUR STUFF

04:07.848 --> 04:10.751
WILL BECOME ALIVE,
PROGRAMMABLE.

04:13.854 --> 04:16.757
EVERY SINGLE OBJECT ON THE
PLANET WILL BE FULLY ADAPTABLE,

04:17.591 --> 04:20.661
AND ABLE TO FIGHT BACK
AGAINST ANY NATURAL DISASTER

04:20.694 --> 04:22.463
THAT COULD IMPERIL US.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.935
BUT EVEN SO, THE PLANET CAN
ONLY SUSTAIN US FOR SO LONG.

04:29.169 --> 04:31.505
SO TO SAVE THE HUMAN RACE,
WE'RE NOT ONLY GOING TO HAVE

04:31.539 --> 04:34.408
TO FIND OURSELVES A
NEW ROCK TO LIVE ON,

04:34.442 --> 04:36.377
WE'LL HAVE TO TERRAFORM IT.

04:38.011 --> 04:40.781
AS WE HUMANS EVOLVE, WHETHER
WE LIVE FOREVER OR WE CLIMB

04:40.814 --> 04:44.918
INTO A COMPUTER, WE ARE GOING
TO NEED A LOT MORE ENERGY.

04:44.952 --> 04:48.356
SO WE'LL NEED TO BUILD A
POWER SOAKING MEGASTRUCTURE

04:48.389 --> 04:50.358
CALLED THE DYSON SPHERE.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.962
THE DYSON SPHERE WILL
SURROUND THE SUN,

04:54.995 --> 04:59.867
ABSORB AND STORE ALL ITS
ENERGY AND POWER OUR TECHNOLOGY

05:00.568 --> 05:02.870
THROUGHOUT THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

05:03.371 --> 05:06.273
THIS INFLUX OF ENERGY WILL
ALLOW US TO LAUNCH OURSELVES

05:06.306 --> 05:08.876
INTO THE GREAT BEYOND,
EXPLORING OUTER SPACE.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.314
AND FINDING RESOURCES TO LIVE
ON THROUGHOUT THE GALAXIES.

05:15.215 --> 05:17.818
AND WHEN WE VOYAGE OUT THERE,
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS:

05:18.886 --> 05:20.921
WE COULD RUN INTO ALIENS.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.225
WILL THEY BE FRIEND OR FOE?

05:25.258 --> 05:27.395
TO BE HONEST, WE
REALLY DON'T KNOW.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.665
ONCE WE'VE TAKEN CONTROL OF ALL
THE ENERGY AND MATTER IN OUR

05:31.699 --> 05:35.736
SOLAR SYSTEM, OUR SOCIETY
WILL MATURE EVEN FURTHER.

05:35.769 --> 05:40.307
BECOMING SO ADVANCED, THAT
SCIENTISTS AND SCI-FI ALIKE CAN

05:40.340 --> 05:43.110
BARELY BRING INTO FOCUS
WHAT OUR WORLD WILL LIKE.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.180
AND BEFORE WE GET
TO THAT WILDEST,

05:47.214 --> 05:50.651
MOST FAR OUT FUTURE SCENARIO,
LET'S START HERE ON EARTH WITH

05:50.684 --> 05:53.220
THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IS
HAPPENING ALL AROUND US.

05:54.955 --> 05:56.857
IMAGINE YOU ARE AN
ENGINEER TRYING TO CRACK

05:56.890 --> 05:58.992
THE CODE FOR OUR SURVIVAL.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.828
YOU ACCIDENTALLY
DROP A CUP,

06:00.861 --> 06:02.195
[CUP SHATTERS]

06:02.229 --> 06:03.997
IT SHATTERS.

06:04.031 --> 06:06.867
BUT THEN IT REFORMS,
INTO SOMETHING ELSE,

06:06.900 --> 06:09.870
SOMETHING YOU NEED, LIKE
THE MODEL OF THE WIND TURBINE

06:09.903 --> 06:11.672
YOU'VE BEEN SKETCHING.

06:11.705 --> 06:15.342
THEN, SCALE WAY ON UP, AND YOU
CAN SEE HOW IT BECOMES THE TECH

06:15.375 --> 06:18.211
THAT WILL SAVE OUR COASTLINES
FROM IMMINENT PERIL.

06:19.112 --> 06:20.247
OSCAR: DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT MANHATTAN?

06:20.280 --> 06:22.750
EVA: YEAH, IT WASHED AWAY
IN THE LATEST STORM SURGE.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.918
OSCAR: WATCH.

06:29.457 --> 06:30.624
SOLAR POWER.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.894
ENOUGH TO POWER HALF
OF THE EAST COAST.

06:33.927 --> 06:39.299
NOW IN BAD WEATHER CONDITIONS,
IT BECOMES A WIND TURBINE.

06:42.169 --> 06:44.738
WHICH IN TURN BECOMES
A SEA DEFENSE,

06:44.772 --> 06:48.141
CAPABLE OF REACTING TO ANY
FORCE THAT COMES ITS WAY.

06:48.175 --> 06:51.645
THE STRONGER THE WAVE,
THE STRONGER THE WALL.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.081
EVA: HOW?

06:54.114 --> 06:56.416
OSCAR: PROGRAMMABLE MATTER.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.453
IT WORKS.

06:59.487 --> 07:01.589
EVA: THIS COULD
BUY US SOME TIME?

07:03.156 --> 07:05.292
NARRATOR: SO HOW DO YOU GET
FROM A BROKEN CUP TO HAVING A

07:05.325 --> 07:07.595
WORLD FULL OF OBJECTS
THAT CAN MORPH AT THE

07:07.628 --> 07:09.329
FLICK OF A SWITCH?

07:09.362 --> 07:12.299
WELL, SCI-FI HAS
ALREADY IMAGINED IT.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.301
ROSE EVELETH: THE SCI-FI THAT I
THINK IS ACTUALLY THE CLOSEST ON

07:14.334 --> 07:15.669
THIS IS BIG HERO 6.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.438
WHERE THEY HAVE ALL THESE
LITTLE TINY NANO METAL THINGIES,

07:18.472 --> 07:20.407
AND THEN YOU CAN
TELL IT TO ASSEMBLE.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.175
GEORGE DVORSKY: THIS MATTER
COULD BASICALLY BECOME

07:22.209 --> 07:25.345
SUPER-FLEXIBLE AND TAKE ON ANY
FORM, ANY SHAPE THAT IT DESIRES.

07:26.480 --> 07:27.781
ANDERS SANDBERG:
NORMAL MATTER IS DUMB.

07:27.815 --> 07:31.885
I CAN'T TELL A SILICON CHIP TO
TURN INTO A WINDOW OR A WALL.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.489
BUT WHAT IF IT WAS COMPOSED
OF SMART MACHINES THAT COULD

07:35.523 --> 07:38.492
RESPOND TO SIGNALS AND
REORGANIZE THEMSELVES.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.794
WELL IN THAT CASE, WE
MIGHT HAVE MATTER THAT YOU

07:40.828 --> 07:42.362
COULD ACTUALLY PROGRAM.

07:42.395 --> 07:44.932
NARRATOR: WELCOME TO
PROGRAMMABLE MATTER.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.667
CHARLES SOULE: AT
A CERTAIN POINT,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.536
WHEN YOU HAVE THESE TECHNOLOGY
LEVELS ENERGY AND MATTER BECOME

07:48.569 --> 07:49.770
VERY FLUID THINGS.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.204
LIKE A ROCK IS NOT A ROCK.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.440
A ROCK IS, IS RAW
MATERIALS AND FUEL.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.843
IT CAN BECOME KIND OF
ANYTHING YOU WANT IT TO BE.

07:56.877 --> 07:59.647
[WIND]

08:01.682 --> 08:03.483
SKYLAR TIBBITS: WE KNOW THAT
WE HAVE OUTDATED AND FAILING

08:03.517 --> 08:06.153
INFRASTRUCTURE,
ROADS, PIPES, BRIDGES,

08:06.854 --> 08:09.256
AND THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE
AN INVESTMENT IN INNOVATION.

08:09.757 --> 08:12.192
BECAUSE WE DON'T JUST WANT
TO BUILD IT THE WAY IT WAS.

08:14.094 --> 08:15.796
NARRATOR: AT THE
SELF ASSEMBLY LAB,

08:15.829 --> 08:17.831
SCIENTISTS ARE WORKING ON
CREATING MATTER THAT CAN

08:17.865 --> 08:20.668
TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO THE
SHAPE OF ANYTHING YOU NEED

08:20.701 --> 08:22.502
IN ANY GIVEN MOMENT.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.237
SKYLAR TIBBITS: OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE

08:24.271 --> 08:26.306
SHOULD NOT JUST BE
OVER-ENGINEERED AND

08:26.339 --> 08:28.576
BULKY AND STATIC.

08:28.609 --> 08:30.243
WE'VE FOCUSED ON
MAKING MATERIALS THAT

08:30.277 --> 08:32.880
CAN TRANSFORM PHYSICALLY.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.648
NARRATOR: YOU HEARD THAT RIGHT.

08:34.682 --> 08:37.050
PROGRAMMABLE MATTER WILL MAKE
OUR ROADS AND BUILDINGS TIGHTEN

08:37.084 --> 08:39.519
DURING AN EARTHQUAKE
SO THEY WON'T CRUMBLE.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.222
IT WILL MAKE CITIES ABLE TO
WITHSTAND THE STRONG WINDS AND

08:42.255 --> 08:44.424
RISING TIDES OF A HURRICANE.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.360
ONCE BUILDINGS ARE BUILT,
THEY WILL NEVER BREAK.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.863
SKYLAR TIBBITS: THERE'S A
NUMBER OF EXAMPLES THAT

08:49.897 --> 08:51.665
WE COULD IMAGINE.

08:51.699 --> 08:56.536
THE ROOF CAN TRANSFORM BASED ON
WIND OR SUN OR RAIN AND BECOME

08:56.570 --> 08:59.372
STRONGER, FLEXIBLE, MORE
POROUS, MORE WATERPROOF.

08:59.406 --> 09:03.944
YOU KNOW, ADAPTING MATERIALS
CAN ADAPT TO ALL SORTS OF CRAZY

09:03.977 --> 09:06.079
CLIMATE AND WEATHER
FLUCTUATIONS.

09:07.114 --> 09:09.382
NARRATOR: IT'S AS IF ALL THE
MATERIALS IN OUR WORLD TODAY

09:09.416 --> 09:11.952
ARE ASLEEP AND IN THE
FUTURE THEY WILL WAKE UP.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.890
YET, WHILE
PROGRAMMABLE MATTER WILL

09:16.924 --> 09:18.558
BE A GAME-CHANGER,

09:18.592 --> 09:21.561
THERE IS A UNIVERSE WHERE
IT BECOMES JUST A BAND-AID.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.732
THE FURY OF MOTHER NATURE
MIGHT BE TOO STRONG,

09:25.232 --> 09:28.268
EVEN FOR AN ARTIFICIALLY
INTELLIGENT CLIMATE CRUSADER

09:28.301 --> 09:30.671
LIKE OUR FUTURE DAUGHTER, JESS.

09:35.575 --> 09:38.411
JESS: WE RAN INTO SOME
OBSTACLES IN THE ENGINEERING OF

09:38.445 --> 09:40.614
THE NEW BIO-TERRAINS.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.983
WE KNEW WE'D HAVE TO FLOOD
SOME OF THIS COASTLINE,

09:43.016 --> 09:47.587
BUT WE HAD TO DECIDE BETWEEN
LOSING THE CITY OR LOSING

09:47.621 --> 09:50.190
EVERYTHING ON THE PENINSULA.

09:58.832 --> 10:01.902
*

10:01.935 --> 10:03.170
NARRATOR: THE PROBLEM
WITH RESOURCES IS THAT

10:03.203 --> 10:05.005
THEY ARE FINITE.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.674
EVEN IN THE FUTURE, WE
WILL NEVER HAVE ENOUGH OF

10:06.707 --> 10:08.475
THEM TO GO AROUND.

10:08.508 --> 10:12.813
AND WHEN WE DECIDE WHO GETS
THEM, THERE WILL BE CASUALTIES.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.157
JESS: YOU OKAY, DAD?

10:24.191 --> 10:26.226
OSCAR: YEAH.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.939
NARRATOR: JESS WAS HOPING THAT
PROGRAMMABLE MATTER COULD HELP

10:38.972 --> 10:40.841
STOP RISING WATER LEVELS.

10:40.874 --> 10:43.143
BUT SHE'S FINDING OUT THE
HARD WAY THAT IT CAN'T KEEP

10:43.176 --> 10:45.478
US SAFE FOREVER.

10:45.512 --> 10:49.016
WHATEVER WE DO, AT SOME
POINT, THE EARTH WILL BECOME

10:49.049 --> 10:53.320
UNINHABITABLE AND THAT IS WHEN
WE'LL HAVE TO LEAVE THE EARTH.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.889
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND A PLANET
THAT'S KIND OF A FIXER-UPPER.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.657
A PLACE THAT HUMANS
CAN TERRAFORM.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.394
WHICH MEANS WE WILL MANIPULATE
ITS ECOSYSTEM TO MAKE IT

11:01.428 --> 11:03.530
HABITABLE FOR US.

11:03.563 --> 11:07.000
BUT MAKING AN ENTIRE PLANET
BEND TO OUR WILL IS GOING TO BE

11:07.034 --> 11:10.037
ANYTHING BUT EASY.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.980
NARRATOR: IN THE FAR FUTURE,
NATURAL DISASTERS AND SOME KIND

11:20.013 --> 11:22.349
OF HORRIFIC EXTINCTION
EVENT WILL MAKE THE

11:22.382 --> 11:25.018
EARTH COMPLETELY
UNINHABITABLE.

11:25.685 --> 11:29.122
SO WE WILL NEED A PLAN "B."

11:29.923 --> 11:32.860
MICHIO KAKU: AS AN INSURANCE
POLICY AGAINST ASTEROID IMPACTS,

11:32.893 --> 11:35.428
AGAINST SUPER
VOLCANOES AND ICE AGES,

11:35.462 --> 11:39.432
I THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO
HAVE A SPARE PLANET OUT THERE,

11:39.466 --> 11:41.769
IN CASE WE HAVE DOOMSDAY
ON THE PLANET EARTH.

11:42.736 --> 11:44.504
NARRATOR: GOOD IDEA.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.874
BUT AFTER WE TACKLE THE
CHALLENGE OF FINDING A SPARE

11:46.907 --> 11:49.576
PLANET, WE'LL NEED TO BRING
HER UP TO HUMAN SPECS.

11:49.609 --> 11:51.879
AND THAT MY FRIENDS
WILL REQUIRE SOME

11:51.912 --> 11:55.582
NEXT-LEVEL ENGINEERING,
WHICH WE CALL TERRAFORMING.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.586
PETER DIAMANDIS: OUR TOOLSET FOR
ACTUALLY ENGINEERING IS BECOMING

11:59.619 --> 12:01.354
STRONGER AND STRONGER.

12:01.388 --> 12:04.191
AND OF COURSE, OUR TOOLSET 30
YEARS FROM NOW WILL BE FAR MORE

12:04.224 --> 12:06.093
ADVANCED, BECAUSE WE'LL
HAVE QUANTUM COMPUTING THAT

12:06.126 --> 12:08.628
UNDERSTANDS HOW TO LOOK
AT NATURAL SYSTEMS.

12:08.661 --> 12:11.231
WE'LL HAVE AI TO HELP
US MONITOR THINGS.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.200
WE'LL HAVE NANOTECHNOLOGY.

12:13.233 --> 12:17.270
SO THE IDEA OF ACTUALLY
TERRAFORMING A PLANET IS GOING

12:17.304 --> 12:20.373
TO BE, I DON'T WANT TO USE
THIS TERM, BUT YOU KNOW,

12:20.407 --> 12:21.975
QUITE SIMPLE.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.743
NARRATOR: SIMPLE
ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SAY,

12:23.777 --> 12:26.046
BUT FOR THE REST OF US IT
STILL FEELS LIKE WE'RE GOING

12:26.079 --> 12:29.349
TO BE BUILDING A PYRAMID
FROM SCRATCH, IN SPACE.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.585
CHUCK NICE: SPACE IS A
HOSTILE PLACE, PEOPLE.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.753
IT'S A HOSTILE PLACE.

12:33.787 --> 12:35.388
DO I WANT TO GO LIVE THERE?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.991
NO, I LIKE IT RIGHT HERE ON
EARTH WHERE OVER A FEW BILLION

12:38.025 --> 12:40.794
YEARS IT HAS MADE THINGS
EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE FOR ME,

12:41.461 --> 12:43.563
AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.999
NARRATOR: IF IT'S COMFORT YOU
WANT, IT'S COMFORT YOU'LL GET.

12:47.334 --> 12:50.904
IN THE FUTURE WE'LL BE ABLE TO
MODIFY A PLANET'S ATMOSPHERE,

12:50.938 --> 12:55.775
TEMPERATURE, AND ECOLOGY, AND
WE'LL ALSO CHANGE OURSELVES TO

12:55.809 --> 12:59.612
ENSURE THAT WE NOT ONLY
SURVIVE, BUT ADAPT AND THRIVE.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.115
NEGIN FARSAD: I'M GOING
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

13:02.149 --> 13:04.284
IN TERMS OF TRAVELING
TO OTHER PLANETS,

13:04.317 --> 13:08.355
I'M NOT A HUGE FAN OF THE IDEA
BECAUSE TO PUT ON A MASK TO

13:08.388 --> 13:12.225
BREATHE JUST DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE A FUN VACATION TO ME.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.796
NARRATOR: THE EARLY DAYS
OF ADJUSTING TO A PARTIALLY

13:16.830 --> 13:19.199
TERRAFORMED PLANET
WILL PROBABLY BE

13:19.232 --> 13:21.268
A BIT UNCOMFORTABLE.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.038
THE FIRST STEPS USUALLY ARE;
JUST LOOK AT OUR SERIES,

13:25.072 --> 13:27.407
"MARS" OR "THE MARTIAN".

13:28.808 --> 13:31.344
BUT BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THE RED PLANET IS ONE OF THE

13:31.378 --> 13:34.814
CLOSEST TO
BEING MOVE-IN READY.

13:34.848 --> 13:37.117
GEORGE DVORSKY: WHAT'S EXCITING
ABOUT MARS IS THAT IT'S WITHIN

13:37.150 --> 13:39.719
THIS HAPPY ZONE IN TERMS OF
ITS DISTANCE FROM THE SUN.

13:39.752 --> 13:42.155
IT HAS CRITICAL INGREDIENTS ON
THERE THAT WE CAN WORK WITH IN

13:42.189 --> 13:44.992
TERMS OF WATER AND OXYGEN.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.360
MATT MIRA: AND IT ONLY TAKES 19
MINUTES FOR A RADIO SIGNAL TO

13:47.394 --> 13:52.399
GET BACK TO EARTH SO I WOULD
NEVER FEEL TOO DISCONNECTED FROM

13:52.432 --> 13:55.702
HUMANITY AND WHERE IT STARTED,
AND IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD SIZE

13:56.336 --> 13:58.138
AND IT SEEMS LIKE A GOOD
PLACE TO START SO I WOULD GET

13:58.171 --> 14:00.073
MY ASS TO MARS.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.374
NARRATOR: GREAT.

14:01.408 --> 14:04.077
BUT HOW ARE WE GOING
TO GET MATT TO MARS?

14:05.378 --> 14:07.714
LET ME TAKE YOU A STEP FURTHER
AND SHOW YOU ONE PATH TO

14:07.747 --> 14:09.849
TERRAFORMING THE RED PLANET.

14:12.785 --> 14:15.755
FIRST, WE WILL BEAM ENERGY
AT MARS' POLAR ICE CAPS,

14:16.589 --> 14:19.326
HEATING THE PLANET,
AND MELTING THE ICE.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.228
THE MELTED ICE WILL
FLOW ALONG THE SURFACE,

14:21.261 --> 14:23.230
AND EVAPORATE INTO THE AIR.

14:23.263 --> 14:26.566
THIS WILL CREATE A GREENHOUSE
EFFECT, WARMING THE ATMOSPHERE.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.168
AND IT NEEDS TO WARM A LOT.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.869
THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE
CURRENTLY ON THE PLANET

14:29.903 --> 14:32.139
IS MINUS 80 FAHRENHEIT.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.042
NOT EXACTLY BALMY.

14:35.075 --> 14:37.377
BUT EVENTUALLY, THE CLIMATE
WILL HEAT UP AND THE FIRST

14:37.410 --> 14:40.513
COLONISTS WILL USE THE WATER
TO IRRIGATE CROPS.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.550
WE'LL HAVE FOOD, WATER,
ENERGY, AND LAND,

14:43.984 --> 14:46.419
A FOUNDATION FOR SUSTAINING
FUTURE HUMAN LIFE.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.455
ROSE EVELETH: IT WOULD BE
A HUGE ENDEAVOR, RIGHT?

14:48.488 --> 14:49.923
JUST THE ENGINEERING
QUESTION OF GETTING.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.125
I MEAN, WE DON'T SEND THAT
MANY PEOPLE TO SPACE, RIGHT?

14:52.159 --> 14:56.196
UM, THE IDEA OF TAKING
HUMANS, PLURAL, UP INTO SPACE,

14:56.229 --> 14:58.731
I MEAN THAT IS JUST AN
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND

14:58.765 --> 15:02.335
RESOURCES AND PLANNING,
AND ALL OF THAT.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.972
NARRATOR: THINKING ABOUT
RE-PROGRAMMING A WHOLE PLANET

15:05.005 --> 15:07.274
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.

15:07.307 --> 15:10.043
BUT MANKIND HAS BEEN MOVING
INTO HOSTILE ENVIRONMENTS

15:10.077 --> 15:11.844
AND MAKING THEM HABITABLE
FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS.

15:13.813 --> 15:15.882
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED TO A SMALL
BARREN ROCK IN THE MIDDLE OF

15:15.915 --> 15:18.718
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN AFTER
THE FATHER OF EVOLUTION

15:18.751 --> 15:20.787
MADE A PIT STOP.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.394
SAM WEBER: IT'S
LIKE ANOTHER WORLD.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.998
WHEN YOU COME FROM THE UK
OR SOME OTHER GREEN NATION,

15:31.698 --> 15:33.967
YOU LAND IN THE AIRFIELD AMONGST
THE LAVA AND THE CINDERS,

15:34.001 --> 15:36.436
I'VE NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE
QUITE LIKE IT BEFORE.

15:38.305 --> 15:41.174
IN THE 1830S, CHARLES DARWIN
VISITED ASCENSION ON HIS VOYAGE

15:41.208 --> 15:43.176
AROUND THE WORLD ON THE BEAGLE.

15:43.210 --> 15:46.513
IT WAS VERY YOUNG, LOTS OF
BARREN, VOLCANIC LAVA FLOWS.

15:46.546 --> 15:49.116
THERE WAS NO NATURAL
RUNNING FRESH WATER.

15:49.149 --> 15:51.751
NARRATOR: WHEN DARWIN ARRIVED,
ASCENSION ISLAND MIGHT AS WELL

15:51.784 --> 15:53.620
HAVE BEEN MARS.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.123
HE COULD BREATHE AIR THERE,
BUT THERE WAS NO EDIBLE FOOD,

15:56.156 --> 15:58.158
AND NO FRESH WATER.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.793
IT WAS NOT HABITABLE FOR
HUMANS IN THE LONG TERM.

16:05.732 --> 16:07.667
SAM WEBER: OBVIOUSLY, WHEN
DARWIN WOULD VISIT THIS ISSUE OF

16:07.700 --> 16:09.969
TRYING TO GET WATER AND
GET FOOD WAS THE CHIEF CONCERN

16:10.003 --> 16:12.472
OF THE TIME, FOR THE
MILITARY THAT WERE BASED HERE.

16:12.505 --> 16:14.307
DARWIN WOULD HAVE
SEEN THAT HIMSELF.

16:14.341 --> 16:17.610
AND AFTER HE RETURNED TO THE
UK, THE IDEA OF VEGETATING GREEN

16:17.644 --> 16:19.646
MOUNTAIN TO TRY AND
INCREASE THE WATER SUPPLY,

16:19.679 --> 16:22.282
WAS GRADUALLY PUT TOGETHER WITH
HIS GREAT FRIEND, JOSEPH HOOKER,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.151
WHO LATER BECAME THE
DIRECTOR OF THE ROYAL

16:24.184 --> 16:25.852
BOTANIC GARDENS AT KEW.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.854
AND OVER THE LATTER PART
OF THE 19TH CENTURY,

16:27.887 --> 16:30.490
THEY BEGAN BRINGING IN
HUNDREDS OF SPECIES OF PLANTS,

16:30.523 --> 16:32.659
TO VEGETATE THE ISLAND.

16:32.692 --> 16:35.562
NARRATOR: DARWIN AND HOOKER
SENT A NOAH'S ARK OF PLANTS AND

16:35.595 --> 16:38.131
TREES, CHOSEN TO
TRANSFORM THE ISLAND,

16:38.165 --> 16:40.667
AND TO CREATE FRESH WATER.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.536
AND WE'LL HAVE TO SEND A
SIMILAR CARE PACKAGE IN ORDER

16:43.570 --> 16:46.073
TO TERRAFORM A
PLACE LIKE MARS.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.408
SAM WEBER: SOME SPECIES WERE
BROUGHT IN TO CREATE PASTURE FOR

16:48.441 --> 16:50.243
COWS, UH, AND SHEEP.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.345
OTHER SPECIES WERE
BROUGHT IN AS WIND BREAKS.

16:52.379 --> 16:54.847
AND SOME, LIKE THIS HUGE FICUS
TREE WE CAN SEE BEHIND US,

16:54.881 --> 16:57.550
WERE BROUGHT IN TO STRIP THE
MOISTURE OUT OF THESE MISTS

16:57.584 --> 16:59.419
BLOWING ACROSS THE
MOUNTAIN, UH,

16:59.452 --> 17:01.188
WHICH IS DRIPPING
DOWN ON US NOW.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.356
AND UH, INCREASE THE
WATER SUPPLY IN THE

17:03.390 --> 17:06.025
WELLS THAT THEY DUG.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.329
NARRATOR: AFTER TWO CENTURIES,
ASCENSION ISLAND HAS BEEN

17:09.362 --> 17:12.365
TRANSFORMED, AND DARWIN
AND HOOKER'S ATTEMPT AT

17:12.399 --> 17:15.568
PROTO-TERRAFORMING THE ISLAND
FOR HUMANS WAS A SUCCESS.

17:17.204 --> 17:19.406
BUT, WE CAN'T IGNORE THE
FLIPSIDE TO TERRAFORMING A

17:19.439 --> 17:21.941
BARREN ROCK, WITH ITS
OWN NATIVE ECOLOGY.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.345
SAM WEBER: WELL THIS
AREA WHERE WE ARE NOW IN,

17:25.378 --> 17:28.215
IN THE MID-ELEVATION REGIONS
WOULD HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY

17:28.248 --> 17:31.851
BARREN WHEN, WHEN HOOKER AND
DARWIN FIRST VISITED THE ISLAND.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.887
UH, MUCH OF THE
LOW-LYING PLAIN AROUND,

17:34.921 --> 17:38.625
AROUND COASTAL REGIONS WERE
COATED IN LAVA AND ASH FIELDS.

17:38.658 --> 17:41.294
THE INTRODUCTIONS THAT DARWIN
AND HOOKER AND OTHERS CARRIED

17:41.328 --> 17:44.631
OUT FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGED THE
ECOLOGY OF ASCENSION ISLAND.

17:44.664 --> 17:46.433
INTRODUCED SPECIES,
BY THEIR NATURE, THEY,

17:46.466 --> 17:50.270
THEY LACK THE NORMAL CONTROLS
THAT WERE KEEPING THEM IN CHECK

17:50.303 --> 17:51.471
IN THEIR NATIVE HABITATS.

17:51.504 --> 17:54.407
SO ONCE THEY ARRIVE,
THEY OFTEN RUN AMOK, UH,

17:54.441 --> 17:58.178
AND CAN'T EXIST IN BALANCE WITH
THE ECOSYSTEMS THEY INVADE.

18:04.251 --> 18:07.287
NARRATOR: ON MARS OR
ASCENSION OR ANYWHERE, REALLY,

18:07.320 --> 18:08.755
WHEN YOU CHANGE AN ECOSYSTEM,

18:08.788 --> 18:11.057
THERE WILL BE
WINNERS AND LOSERS.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.793
ON ASCENSION, HUMANS
MADE THE ISLAND LIVABLE,

18:14.527 --> 18:16.963
BUT AT THE EXPENSE OF
THE NATURAL HABITAT.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.268
SAM WEBER: HOOKER KNEW WHAT THE
CONSEQUENCES OF HIS ACTIONS WERE

18:21.301 --> 18:24.671
LIKELY TO BE, BUT HOOKER
OBVIOUSLY MADE A VALUE JUDGMENT

18:24.704 --> 18:28.107
AT THAT TIME, SECURING WATER AND
FOOD WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN

18:28.141 --> 18:31.010
ANY KIND OF MODERN
CONSERVATION IMPERATIVE.

18:31.043 --> 18:33.112
SO HE PRESSED AHEAD.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.747
IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO
BE A PROBLEM WHEN,

18:34.781 --> 18:38.285
WHEN PEOPLE'S NEEDS COME
INTO CONFLICT WITH WILDLIFE.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.654
NARRATOR: WHAT'S THE EXTINCTION
OF A FEW PLANTS COMPARED WITH

18:41.688 --> 18:43.490
THE EXTINCTION OF HUMANITY?

18:43.523 --> 18:45.124
RIGHT?

18:45.158 --> 18:46.626
WELL, NOT REALLY.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.761
THAT'S TOO SHORT SIGHTED.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.663
WHAT CREATURE WAS
EATING THOSE FERNS?

18:50.697 --> 18:52.199
AND WHAT PREDATOR WAS
EATING THE CREATURE THAT

18:52.232 --> 18:53.800
WAS EATING THOSE FERNS?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.835
WILL THEY ALL GO EXTINCT?

18:55.868 --> 18:58.971
AND IN THE END, WILL THOSE
EXTINCTIONS LEAD TO OUR OWN?

19:00.207 --> 19:02.509
THIS LIKELY WON'T BE
A PROBLEM ON MARS.

19:02.542 --> 19:04.811
AS FAR AS WE KNOW, THERE
ARE NO LIFEFORMS THERE.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.415
BUT WHAT IF WE NEED TO
TERRAFORM SOMEPLACE ELSE?

19:09.482 --> 19:11.718
SOME FUTURISTS THINK OPTION
"B" MIGHT BE JUPITER'S MOON,

19:11.751 --> 19:13.186
EUROPA.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.054
WHY?

19:15.087 --> 19:17.457
BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IT COULD
BE COVERED IN WATER AND WATER

19:17.490 --> 19:20.059
MEANS THE POSSIBILITY OF LIFE.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.201
EVA'S SCIENTIFIC COLLEAGUES
ARE GETTING READY TO SET UP A

19:28.235 --> 19:30.670
COLONY THERE AND THEY'RE
PUTTING THE HARD SELL ON

19:30.703 --> 19:32.171
HER TO JOIN THEM.

19:32.205 --> 19:36.309
IF EUROPA IS INCUBATING LIFE
IN ITS WATERS, SHOULDN'T EVA,

19:36.343 --> 19:39.078
A GENETICIST BY TRADE,
BE RUSHING TO WORK THERE?

19:40.079 --> 19:41.381
EVA: WHY NOT JUST PORT THERE?

19:41.414 --> 19:44.684
IT'S NOT EXACTLY WELCOMING
TO BIOLOGICAL LIFE.

19:44.717 --> 19:47.387
WELL, APART FROM THE
BIOLOGICAL FORMS IN ITS OCEANS.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.389
WOMAN: EXACTLY.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.858
THIS IS A GENETICIST'S DREAM.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.193
MAN: THIS IS THE ONLY OTHER
NON-TERRESTRIAL LIFE WE'VE FOUND

19:54.227 --> 19:56.429
IN OUR GALAXY SO FAR.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.565
MAN: WE'VE BEEN FANTASIZING
ABOUT THIS FOR DECADES.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.868
EVA: BUT WHAT, WHAT ABOUT
THE RADIATION ON EUROPA,

20:02.235 --> 20:03.436
AND THE TEMPERATURES?

20:03.470 --> 20:05.705
WOMAN: WE'RE NOT SAYING
THERE AREN'T RISKS.

20:05.738 --> 20:08.441
MAN: WE'RE SAYING,
IT'S WORTH IT.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.781
EVA: I NEED TO BE HERE.

20:14.814 --> 20:16.249
MAN: WE'LL CALL YOU
WHEN WE GET THERE.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.650
WOMAN: BYE.

20:27.927 --> 20:30.597
NARRATOR: IF WE'VE LEARNED
ANYTHING FROM ASCENSION ISLAND,

20:30.630 --> 20:33.466
COLONIZING A PLACE THAT
HAS EXISTING LIFE FORMS

20:33.500 --> 20:36.936
RAISES A LOT OF CHALLENGES
BOTH PRACTICAL AND ETHICAL.

20:39.772 --> 20:42.275
IN ANOTHER ECHO OF
ASCENSION ISLAND,

20:42.309 --> 20:45.912
WHEN WE TERRAFORM EUROPA,
WE RUN THE RISK OF POTENTIALLY

20:45.945 --> 20:49.316
DESTROYING MIRCO-ORGANISMS
THAT COULD EVENTUALLY EVOLVE

20:49.349 --> 20:52.319
INTO INTELLIGENT LIFE.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.322
ANNALEE NEWITZ: WE'RE CREATURES
THAT EVOLVED IN THE WATER,

20:55.355 --> 20:58.458
AND THAT'S WHY EUROPA
SEEMS SO INTERESTING,

20:59.191 --> 21:02.261
BECAUSE WE'RE FAIRLY CERTAIN
THAT THERE IS A MASSIVE OCEAN

21:02.295 --> 21:05.432
UNDERNEATH A CRUST OF ICE.

21:05.465 --> 21:09.569
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ONLY WAY WE
CAN FIND LIFE IS BY DRILLING

21:09.602 --> 21:13.340
THROUGH THE ICE AND PUTTING
A ROBOT IN THE WATER.

21:13.373 --> 21:16.843
SO YOU KNOW, UH,
WHAT COULD GO WRONG?

21:17.844 --> 21:19.446
N.K. JEMISIN: WE'RE GOING
TO THIS OTHER WORLD,

21:19.479 --> 21:20.847
AND EVEN WITH THE
BEST OF INTENTIONS,

21:20.880 --> 21:24.183
WE MIGHT END UP DOING
KIND OF TREMENDOUS HARM.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.721
ANNALEE NEWITZ: IN THE MOVIE
"2010", THE SEQUEL TO "2001",

21:29.389 --> 21:32.659
THERE'S AN OFTEN-QUOTED MOMENT
WHERE THE ALIENS SAY TO THE

21:32.692 --> 21:36.162
HUMANS, "ALL THESE WORLDS
ARE YOURS EXCEPT EUROPA.

21:36.863 --> 21:39.532
ATTEMPT NO LANDINGS THERE."

21:40.066 --> 21:42.669
NARRATOR: NOT ONLY COULD
WE END LIFE ON EUROPA,

21:42.702 --> 21:45.372
ONE WRONG MOVE AND
EUROPA COULD END US.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.440
A PLANET WITH LIFE MEANS
BIOLOGICAL HAZARDS

21:47.474 --> 21:49.342
LEFT AND RIGHT.

21:49.376 --> 21:51.711
FORGET LITTLE GREEN
MEN WITH RAY GUNS,

21:51.744 --> 21:55.948
WHAT WE SHOULD REALLY FEAR IS
A VIRUS OR GERM THAT OUR BODIES

21:55.982 --> 21:59.852
CAN'T HANDLE, AN INVASIVE
SPECIES THAT INVADES US.

22:01.087 --> 22:04.123
MARTIN REES: IF WE FOUND
LIFE, EVEN SIMPLE LIFE,

22:04.156 --> 22:06.893
WE OUGHT TO NOT LET IT
CONTAMINATE US ON EARTH.

22:06.926 --> 22:10.463
SO WE WOULD TREAT ANY UH,
PLANET WHICH TURNED OUT TO HAVE

22:10.497 --> 22:12.899
LIFE ON IT, RATHER AS
WE TREAT THE ANTARCTIC,

22:12.932 --> 22:15.568
AS A SORT OF
NATURAL WILDERNESS.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.905
ANNALEE NEWITZ: ONE
OF MY HOPES IS THAT,

22:18.938 --> 22:21.908
AS WE MOVE TO OTHER
PLANETS OR MOONS,

22:21.941 --> 22:27.246
THAT WE ALWAYS CONSIDER OUR WORK
TO BE NOT TURNING IT INTO EARTH,

22:28.114 --> 22:31.884
BUT CREATING LITTLE POCKETS
OF HABITABLE SPACE FOR HUMANS,

22:32.952 --> 22:37.089
AND HUGE AREAS THAT ARE
JUST THE NATURAL HABITAT.

22:37.123 --> 22:40.593
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO MAKE
THE MISTAKE THAT WE'VE MADE ON

22:40.627 --> 22:43.830
EARTH SO MANY TIMES, WHERE WE
GO INTO A HABITAT THAT DOESN'T

22:43.863 --> 22:47.333
CONTAIN HUMANS, AND JUST
WRECK ALL OF THE CREATURES

22:47.366 --> 22:49.201
THAT LIVE THERE.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.506
NARRATOR: AND EUROPA IS
THE MOST LIKELY PLACE WE

22:53.540 --> 22:56.609
WOULD RUN INTO THAT LIFE.

22:56.643 --> 22:58.578
AND LIKE ANY COLONIAL
CIVILIZATION,

22:58.611 --> 23:01.180
KEEPING THE SETTLERS SAFE
IS CRITICAL TO OUR SURVIVAL

23:01.213 --> 23:03.450
AS A SPECIES.

23:09.255 --> 23:12.058
EVA'S BEEN EXAMINING THE GENES
OF EUROPA'S SETTLER REMOTELY,

23:12.091 --> 23:13.526
SINCE THEY LANDED.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.361
AND IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A PROBLEM.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.396
EVA: OH, STOP.

23:17.430 --> 23:19.632
OSCAR: WHAT?

23:19.666 --> 23:21.067
EVA: IT'S MUTATED.

23:21.100 --> 23:22.802
OSCAR: IS THAT BAD?

23:22.835 --> 23:25.271
EVA: THAT'S CATASTROPHIC.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.740
IT'S AN EXTREMELY DELICATE
ECOSYSTEM WHICH WE'RE TRYING TO

23:27.774 --> 23:28.941
LEAVE UNSCATHED.

23:28.975 --> 23:32.178
AND IF WE DON'T
CONTAIN IT, WE.

23:34.847 --> 23:38.618
OKAY, COMPOSE MESSAGE
TO THE EUROPA COLONY.

23:38.651 --> 23:41.287
STATUS, URGENT.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.456
PLEASE IMPLEMENT, STAT.

23:43.490 --> 23:46.559
FOR YOUR SAFETY AND THE
WELL-BEING OF EUROPA.

23:46.593 --> 23:48.495
STAY SAFE, GUYS.

23:53.600 --> 23:56.536
WHO KNEW IT WOULD BE THIS
EASY TO CHANGE THE WORLD, HUH?

24:05.111 --> 24:07.279
NARRATOR: SURVIVAL DEEPER AND
DEEPER INTO THE COSMOS WON'T

24:07.313 --> 24:09.081
ALWAYS BE WELCOMING.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.784
EVEN THOUGH THE HUMAN RACE
WILL ULTIMATELY THRIVE,

24:11.818 --> 24:14.286
THERE MAY BE CASUALTIES
ALONG THE WAY.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.823
SPACE, IT'S
DANGEROUS OUT THERE!

24:19.225 --> 24:21.828
WE'VE LEFT EARTH,
TERRAFORMED MARS,

24:21.861 --> 24:24.531
AND ENCOUNTERED LIFE IN THE
DEPTH'S OF EUROPA'S CRUST.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.699
ALL THAT SPACE EXPLORATION
AND TRAVEL DOESN'T COME

24:26.733 --> 24:28.467
WITHOUT A COST.

24:28.501 --> 24:30.469
AND MUCH OF THAT COST
WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE

24:30.503 --> 24:32.539
PAID IN ENERGY!

24:32.572 --> 24:35.141
AND WE'LL GET THAT ENERGY
FROM A HUGE MEGASTRUCTURE

24:35.174 --> 24:37.376
CALLED A DYSON SPHERE...

24:40.680 --> 24:43.015
THAT WE WILL BUILD
AROUND THE SUN.

24:48.588 --> 24:51.524
NARRATOR: IF WE'VE
LEARNED ANYTHING SO FAR,

24:51.558 --> 24:53.526
IT'S THAT MAKING THE SOLAR
SYSTEM HABITABLE FOR FUTURE

24:53.560 --> 24:55.828
HUMANS IS NO SMALL FEAT.

24:55.862 --> 24:59.231
OUR EXISTENCE WILL BECOME SO
ADVANCED AND COMPLEX THAT WE

24:59.265 --> 25:01.534
ARE GOING TO NEED ENERGY
ON A LEVEL THAT OUR BRAINS

25:01.568 --> 25:03.770
HAVE ONLY BEGUN TO IMAGINE.

25:06.105 --> 25:07.574
BRIAN GREENE: AS WE LOOK
AT TECHNOLOGICAL GROWTH,

25:07.607 --> 25:10.142
WE FIND THAT IT'S
INCREASING EXPONENTIALLY.

25:10.176 --> 25:12.845
BUT OF COURSE, THEN THE
POWER NEEDS ARE GOING UP

25:12.879 --> 25:14.581
EXPONENTIALLY, TOO.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.916
SO YOU CAN LOOK INTO
THE FUTURE AND SAY,

25:16.949 --> 25:21.053
WHERE ARE WE EVER GOING TO
MUSTER THE KIND OF POWER THAT

25:21.087 --> 25:22.922
WE'LL NEED IN THE FAR FUTURE?

25:22.955 --> 25:25.558
WE CAN'T GET IT JUST
ON PLANET EARTH.

25:25.592 --> 25:29.061
SO YOU GO TO A NEARBY OBJECT
THAT HAS ENOUGH POWER TO MEET

25:29.095 --> 25:31.197
YOUR NEEDS, WHICH
WOULD BE THE SUN.

25:31.230 --> 25:33.833
CHARLES SOULE: EVERY STAR IS
POTENTIALLY A SOURCE OF ENERGY,

25:33.866 --> 25:36.168
EVERY STAR IN THE SKY IS
SOMETHING THAT WE COULD USE

25:36.202 --> 25:39.538
WITHIN OUR CIVILIZATION
TO ADVANCE OURSELVES.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.708
ROSE EVELETH: IF WE HAD THE
ABILITY TO GET ALL OF THE ENERGY

25:41.741 --> 25:44.543
OF OUR SUN AND USE IT, WE WOULD
SOLVE SO MANY CONFLICTS THAT ARE

25:44.577 --> 25:45.845
EXISTING RIGHT NOW.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.614
THERE WOULDN'T BE THE
NEED TO DRILL FOR OIL,

25:47.647 --> 25:50.750
THERE WOULDN'T BE THE
NEED TO BURN COAL.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.053
NARRATOR: DRILLING FOR OIL AND
BURNING COAL WILL SEEM LIKE THE

25:54.086 --> 25:56.623
STUFF OF CAVE MEN.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.891
WHEN WE HARNESS THE
POWER OF THE SUN,

25:58.925 --> 26:01.060
THE ONCE LIMITED
RESOURCE OF ENERGY WILL

26:01.093 --> 26:03.663
NOW BECOME NEAR UNLIMITED.

26:04.597 --> 26:06.899
WE'LL HAVE ONE LESS
THING TO FIGHT WARS OVER,

26:06.933 --> 26:09.902
AND OUR EVER-EXPANDING POPULACE
WILL ALWAYS BE ABLE TO KEEP THE

26:09.936 --> 26:12.104
LIGHTS ON, INDEFINITELY.

26:13.172 --> 26:15.942
ENTER THE DYSON SPHERE.

26:18.611 --> 26:22.915
BRIAN GREENE: A DYSON SPHERE IS
AN IDEA THAT FREEMAN DYSON PUT

26:22.949 --> 26:25.251
FORWARD A LONG TIME AGO.

26:25.284 --> 26:28.254
AND THE IDEA SIMPLY IS, YOU'VE
GOT A STAR OUT THERE, THIS BIG,

26:28.287 --> 26:31.958
BURNING NUCLEAR FURNACE,
150 MILLION KILOMETERS AWAY.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.295
WHY NOT ENCASE IT IN A
BIG SPHERE, IF YOU WILL,

26:37.630 --> 26:39.598
THAT CAN CAPTURE ALL THE
ENERGY THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

26:39.632 --> 26:42.802
JUST STREAM OFF INTO SPACE.

26:42.835 --> 26:46.172
ANNALEE NEWITZ: SO YOU LITERALLY
BUILD A SHELL AROUND THE SUN,

26:46.205 --> 26:48.440
AND LIVE ON THE
INSIDE OF THE SHELL.

26:48.474 --> 26:52.812
AND THAT WAY, YOU CAN SUCK UP
EVERY SINGLE POSSIBLE PHOTON AND

26:52.845 --> 26:55.682
CONVERT IT INTO ENERGY
FOR YOUR CIVILIZATION.

26:55.715 --> 26:57.616
BARATUNDE THURSTON:
OUR CREATIVITY,

26:57.650 --> 26:59.686
MARRIED TO TECHNOLOGY, WILL
FIND NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY,

26:59.719 --> 27:02.288
AND WE'LL BE ABLE TO HARNESS
POWER FROM THE SUN IN A WAY THAT

27:02.321 --> 27:03.622
WE COULDN'T IMAGINE YET.

27:03.656 --> 27:06.092
CHUCK NICE: SO FEAR NOT,
PEOPLE, IT'S OKAY.

27:06.125 --> 27:07.259
[WHISPERS]

27:07.293 --> 27:09.161
I'M LYING,
I'M SCARED TO DEATH.

27:10.396 --> 27:11.998
NARRATOR: BUILDING SOMETHING
AS BIG AND COMPLICATED AS THE

27:12.031 --> 27:14.633
DYSON SPHERE IS A LITTLE SCARY.

27:15.835 --> 27:18.871
BUT WHAT WILL OUR SOLAR
POWERED CIVILIZATION LOOK LIKE?

27:18.905 --> 27:21.640
WILL WE EVEN STILL
HAVE HUMAN FORMS?

27:21.674 --> 27:25.544
SOME FUTURISTS THINKS THE DYSON
SPHERE WILL BE USED TO POWER UP

27:25.577 --> 27:29.048
THE METAVERSE, THE REAL
LIFE MATRIX COMPUTER WORLD

27:29.081 --> 27:31.350
WE MAY ALL EVENTUALLY
LIVE INSIDE OF.

27:32.651 --> 27:35.121
CHARLES SOULE: AND WE'RE
LIVING INSIDE THIS BOX,

27:35.154 --> 27:37.990
ORBITING THE SUN, ALL
OF HUMAN CONSCIOUSNESS,

27:38.024 --> 27:40.893
ALL OF US PUT TOGETHER IN THIS
BEAUTIFUL PUDDLE OF MINDS.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.362
IT SOUNDS LIKE,
IT'S MAGIC, RIGHT?

27:43.395 --> 27:45.832
IT'S WHEN MAGIC AND SCIENCE
BECOME KIND OF THE SAME THING.

27:45.865 --> 27:48.534
NARRATOR: WHETHER WE WILL BE
HUMAN BODIES OR HUMAN CODE

27:48.567 --> 27:50.502
WE'RE GOING TO
NEED BIG ENERGY,

27:50.536 --> 27:54.173
AND BIG SCIENCE TO MAKE
A DYSON SPHERE BECAUSE

27:54.206 --> 27:56.709
IT'S JUST SO BIG.

27:58.244 --> 28:01.280
CURRENT HUMAN LIFE USES ABOUT
15 TRILLION WATTS OF POWER.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.683
A DYSON SPHERE
COULD BE ABLE TO EXTRACT

28:04.717 --> 28:08.587
4 TIMES 10 TO THE
26 WATTS OF POWER.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.590
THAT'S 26 ZEROS AFTER THE ONE.

28:11.623 --> 28:13.592
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.828
26.

28:15.862 --> 28:18.030
STILL GOING.

28:18.464 --> 28:20.266
ROSE EVELETH: I MEAN, JUST
LIKE THE SCALE AT WHICH

28:20.299 --> 28:21.600
THIS EXISTS, RIGHT.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.602
THE, IF, THIS IS BIGGER
THAN A DEATH STAR.

28:23.635 --> 28:26.338
THIS IS BIGGER THAN LIKE, YOU
KNOW, LIKE THAT'S NO MOON, NO,

28:26.372 --> 28:28.674
THAT'S NO SUN, LIKE IT'S HUGE.

28:28.707 --> 28:31.443
NARRATOR: THE DYSON
SPHERE WOULD BE ENORMOUS,

28:31.477 --> 28:34.613
A GIGANTIC GLOBE THAT WOULD
INCLUDE NOT ONLY THE EARTH,

28:34.646 --> 28:37.616
BUT EVERY PLANET
BETWEEN US AND THE SUN.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.453
THE DYSON SPHERE WOULD BE
CAPABLE OF POWERING ALL OF THE

28:41.487 --> 28:44.590
TECH INSIDE OF IT,
AND EVEN OUTSIDE OF IT.

28:45.792 --> 28:48.294
REMEMBER THAT COLONY
WE SET UP ON EUROPA?

28:48.327 --> 28:50.963
IT MAY BE OUTSIDE
THE DYSON SPHERE,

28:50.997 --> 28:54.566
BUT IT'S STILL USING IT
AS A GIANT SUPER BATTERY.

28:56.102 --> 28:58.404
SO HOW ARE WE GOING TO
START THE BIGGEST CONSTRUCTION

28:58.437 --> 29:01.941
JOB EVER ATTEMPTED IN THE
HISTORY OF THE KNOWN UNIVERSE?

29:03.776 --> 29:07.079
THE DYSON SPHERE IS 600
MILLION TIMES BIGGER THAN THE

29:07.113 --> 29:11.250
SURFACE OF EARTH, SO THAT
MEANS WE NEED MORE MATTER THAN

29:11.283 --> 29:13.452
WE HAVE ON THIS PLANET.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.688
WE WILL HAVE TO FIND
WHAT WE NEED OUT IN SPACE,

29:17.289 --> 29:19.758
FROM OTHER PLANETS
AND ON ASTEROIDS,

29:20.192 --> 29:23.195
WHICH ARE CHOCK FULL
OF IRON AND OTHER METALS.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.764
ROSE EVELETH: ASTEROID MINING
IS THE NEXT BIG THING IN SPACE.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.467
I MEAN, THEY'RE ALREADY, NASA
IS BUILDING BIG NETS TO CATCH

29:28.500 --> 29:31.503
ASTEROIDS, TO MINE THEM.

29:31.537 --> 29:33.505
CHARLES SOULE: IF WE CAN
JUST, LIKE, BRING, LIKE,

29:33.539 --> 29:36.475
ASTEROID MINING ONLINE AND,
AND CAN JUST ACCESS ALL OF THAT

29:36.508 --> 29:39.278
STUFF OUT THERE, THEN WE COULD
BUILD AN ENTIRELY NEW SOCIETY.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.148
NARRATOR: BUT THERE'S A
POTENTIAL WRINKLE WITH MINING

29:42.181 --> 29:44.750
ASTEROIDS: WHO
OWNS THESE HUGE,

29:44.783 --> 29:46.685
POTENTIALLY
LUCRATIVE GOLD MINES?

29:47.186 --> 29:49.455
WHOEVER GETS THERE FIRST.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.790
PETER DIAMANDIS: AND SOME OF
THE ASTEROIDS WE HAVE TARGETED

29:51.824 --> 29:54.994
ARE HALF A KILOMETER IN SIZE,
AND THEY'RE ON THE OPEN MARKET,

29:55.027 --> 29:57.529
TRILLION-DOLLAR ASSETS.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.998
ROSE EVELETH: WE'VE ALREADY
HAD A COUPLE OF POLITICAL

29:59.031 --> 30:00.099
FIGHTS ABOUT THE MOON, RIGHT.

30:00.132 --> 30:01.433
WE NEED THE MOON.

30:01.467 --> 30:03.535
IF SOMEBODY MESSES UP THE
MOON, IT'S A BIG PROBLEM.

30:03.569 --> 30:05.637
SO THERE'S ALREADY SORT OF
TREATIES ABOUT HOW THE MOON IS

30:05.671 --> 30:06.672
KIND OF OFF-LIMITS.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.474
BUT ASTEROIDS ARE NOT.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.209
AND SO I THINK THAT WE'RE GOING
TO SEE SOME REALLY INTERESTING

30:10.242 --> 30:13.712
GEOPOLITICAL CONFLICTS
OVER ASTEROIDS.

30:13.745 --> 30:16.015
NARRATOR: BESIDES ASTEROIDS,
WE CAN ALSO PLUNDER THE

30:16.048 --> 30:18.517
RESOURCES OF A FEW PLANETS.

30:18.550 --> 30:20.452
GEORGE DVORSKY:
MERCURY AND VENUS.

30:20.486 --> 30:22.288
THESE PLANETS ARE DEAD,
THERE'S NO LIFE ON IT,

30:22.321 --> 30:24.156
THEY REALLY SERVE NO PURPOSE
AND IT'LL BE EXCEPTIONALLY

30:24.190 --> 30:25.557
DIFFICULT TO TERRAFORM THEM.

30:25.591 --> 30:26.792
MERCURY, IN PARTICULAR.

30:26.825 --> 30:29.795
SO WHY NOT USE THAT
MASS FOR OUR NEEDS?

30:29.828 --> 30:32.865
NARRATOR: IT'S A SOLAR
SYSTEM-WIDE RENOVATION.

30:32.899 --> 30:35.534
HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK.

30:35.567 --> 30:38.737
FIRST WE'LL BUILD A FACTORY
ON THE SURFACE OF MERCURY.

30:39.605 --> 30:41.573
ROBOTS WILL MELT
AND MANUFACTURE MATERIALS

30:41.607 --> 30:43.342
FOR SOLAR PANELS,

30:43.375 --> 30:45.878
THAT WILL HELP POWER EVEN
MORE AND MORE PRODUCTION.

30:47.513 --> 30:50.182
NEXT, WE LAUNCH THESE
SOLAR PANELS INTO SPACE,

30:50.216 --> 30:53.019
POSITIONING THEM IN PLACE
AROUND THE SUN TO FORM THE

30:53.052 --> 30:55.721
MASSIVE DYSON SPHERE.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.358
ANDERS SANDBERG: SO YOU WOULD
START BY PUTTING AN AUTOMATED

30:59.391 --> 31:01.093
FACTORY ON THE SURFACE.

31:01.127 --> 31:04.530
SOLAR POWERED, IT CHURNS OUT
ROBOTS TO DIG UP MATERIAL,

31:04.563 --> 31:07.900
MELT IT TOGETHER TO MAKE MORE
SOLAR PANELS AND MORE ROBOTS AND

31:07.934 --> 31:09.701
MORE MINING EQUIPMENT.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.538
AFTER A WHILE, YOU'VE COVERED
MUCH OF THE SURFACE OF MERCURY

31:12.571 --> 31:14.706
WITH THESE FACTORIES.

31:14.740 --> 31:17.910
THEN WE START MAKING LAUNCH
DEVICES TO LAUNCH SOLAR PANELS

31:17.944 --> 31:19.611
INTO SPACE.

31:19.645 --> 31:22.014
NARRATOR: WE'LL HAVE ACCESS
TO NEARLY UNLIMITED ENERGY

31:22.048 --> 31:24.216
AND THIS FLOATING
SPHERE WILL ALLOW PRODUCTION

31:24.250 --> 31:26.418
TO SPEED UP EXPONENTIALLY.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.055
GEORGE DVORSKY: YOU'LL START TO
SEE THE ENTIRE SUN ENVELOPED BY

31:29.088 --> 31:31.790
THIS MASSIVE BUBBLE
OF SOLAR PANELS.

31:31.823 --> 31:34.360
AND, FROM AN OUTSIDE OBSERVER,
THE SUN WILL LARGELY HAVE BEEN

31:34.393 --> 31:36.762
EXTINGUISHED, BECAUSE
NOW, INSIDE THAT ZONE,

31:36.795 --> 31:39.065
WE'RE CAPTURING ALL OF THE
SOLAR ENERGY AVAILABLE,

31:39.098 --> 31:41.733
THROUGH THE DYSON SPHERE, TO
BE ABLE TO POWER IT AND SUPPLY,

31:41.767 --> 31:43.902
YOU KNOW, OUR CIVILIZATION
WITH ITS ENERGY NEEDS.

31:43.936 --> 31:47.906
CHUCK NICE: HOPEFULLY WE WILL
HAVE, I'M GOING TO SAY IT,

31:47.940 --> 31:50.709
FLYING CARS.

31:50.742 --> 31:53.879
NARRATOR: I KNOW, IT DOES SEEM
LIKE THIS GIANT SPHERE IS JUST

31:53.912 --> 31:56.615
AS FANTASTICAL AS A FLYING CAR.

31:56.648 --> 32:00.019
BUT IT'S THE MOST LOGICAL AND
EFFICIENT USE OF A STAR'S POWER

32:00.586 --> 32:03.622
THAT HUMANITY HAS DREAMED UP.

32:03.655 --> 32:08.460
AND, IN 2015, RESEARCHERS AT
SETI NOTICED A STAR WHOSE LIGHT

32:08.494 --> 32:10.729
FLICKERS MYSTERIOUSLY.

32:10.762 --> 32:14.666
SOME THEORIZE THAT THE LIGHT
PATTERN INDICATES THAT THE STAR

32:14.700 --> 32:17.636
IS SURROUNDED
BY A DYSON SPHERE.

32:19.538 --> 32:21.640
THAT'S HOW MUCH SOME MEMBERS
OF THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY

32:21.673 --> 32:24.476
BELIEVE AN ADVANCE
CIVILIZATION WOULD DEPEND ON

32:24.510 --> 32:27.579
THIS KIND OF MEGASTRUCTURE.

32:27.613 --> 32:29.781
BUT WITH ANYTHING THIS BIG,
IT'S LIKELY WE MAY HAVE TO DO

32:29.815 --> 32:31.750
A LITTLE TROUBLESHOOTING
ALONG THE WAY.

32:31.783 --> 32:37.156
BRIAN GREENE: ONE OF THE ISSUES
WITH A DYSON SPHERE IS THAT IT

32:37.189 --> 32:40.759
WILL WARM UP, BECAUSE
IT'S SURROUNDING THE SUN,

32:40.792 --> 32:44.296
AND THEN IT WILL START TO
RADIATE ENERGY IN ITS OWN RIGHT.

32:45.664 --> 32:48.934
DO YOU JUST LET THAT ENERGY
ITSELF NOW GO OFF INTO SPACE AND

32:48.967 --> 32:51.970
BE WASTED, OR DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER SPHERE THAT CAPTURES THE

32:52.004 --> 32:56.008
WASTE ENERGY OF THE FIRST
SPHERE, AND MAKE USE OF IT.

32:56.808 --> 32:58.477
NARRATOR: SO WE'LL
HAVE A SPHERE OUTSIDE THE

32:58.510 --> 33:02.114
DYSON SPHERE THAT WILL SUCK
UP EVERY LAST BIT OF ENERGY.

33:02.148 --> 33:04.283
AND WE'LL NEED IT ONCE
WE ARE SO TECHNOLOGICALLY

33:04.316 --> 33:06.852
ADVANCED THAT EVERY
BIT OF POWER WILL COUNT.

33:08.154 --> 33:11.723
BUT AT SOME POINT THE
SUN'S ENERGY IS NOT GOING TO

33:11.757 --> 33:14.193
BE ENOUGH ENERGY.

33:14.226 --> 33:17.063
MARS AND MERCURY WILL
RUN OUT OF RESOURCES.

33:17.096 --> 33:20.466
AND ALL OF US,
INCLUDE EVA AND OSCAR,

33:20.499 --> 33:23.969
WHO HAVE DIGITALLY
UPLOADED TO THE METAVERSE,

33:24.002 --> 33:26.238
WILL HAVE TO MAKE
THE HARDEST OF CHOICES AND

33:26.272 --> 33:28.340
ABANDON EARTH
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

33:33.445 --> 33:36.915
EVA: WE MUST MAXIMIZE
OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.985
WE DON'T HAVE THE MATERIALS.

33:40.018 --> 33:43.055
MERCURY WILL BE GONE BY
THE TIME WE'RE DONE HERE.

33:43.089 --> 33:45.357
OSCAR: WE CAN MOVE ONTO VENUS.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.526
MINE IT, TOO.

33:47.559 --> 33:49.628
AND THEN, AFTER?

33:51.063 --> 33:52.998
EVA: ARE YOU SURE?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.433
OSCAR: WELL, IF WE DON'T
HAVE ENOUGH RESOURCES,

33:54.466 --> 33:56.368
WE MIGHT HAVE TO.

33:56.402 --> 33:58.537
EVA: BUT, THAT'S OUR HOME.

33:58.570 --> 34:00.706
OSCAR: IT WAS.

34:00.739 --> 34:03.109
BUT WE'VE MOVED ON.

34:03.809 --> 34:06.545
AND THOSE WHO HAVEN'T,
WE CAN RELOCATE.

34:12.451 --> 34:14.386
NARRATOR: IT WILL BE A SAD
MOMENT WHEN WE HAVE TO LEAVE

34:14.420 --> 34:16.288
OUR PLANET BEHIND.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.457
BUT SINCE
WE'LL ALL BE DIGITAL,

34:18.490 --> 34:22.161
WE DON'T
REALLY NEED IT TO EXIST.

34:22.828 --> 34:25.464
SO WHERE DOES
HUMANITY GO FROM HERE?

34:25.964 --> 34:27.633
HOW DO YOU LEVEL UP WHEN
YOU HAVE COLONIZED THE ENTIRE

34:27.666 --> 34:31.303
SOLAR SYSTEM AND
BECOME POST-HUMAN?

34:31.837 --> 34:34.906
BRIAN GREENE: THE NATURAL NEXT
STEP, BEYOND DYSON SPHERES,

34:34.940 --> 34:37.443
IF WE'RE ABLE TO HARNESS THE
ENERGY OF INDIVIDUAL STARS,

34:38.944 --> 34:41.847
WOULD BE TO HARNESS THE
ENERGY OF THE GALAXY.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.818
NARRATOR: ONE OF THE REASONS WE
FIGHT OVER RESOURCES IS BECAUSE

34:46.852 --> 34:48.887
OF THE QUESTION OF OWNERSHIP.

34:48.920 --> 34:51.490
ONE COUNTRY HAS OIL, THE
OTHER COUNTRY WANTS IT.

34:52.291 --> 34:53.992
BUT ONCE WE START LOOKING
BEYOND OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

34:54.025 --> 34:55.827
FOR RESOURCES,

34:55.861 --> 34:59.565
THE QUESTION OF WHO OWNS WHAT
GETS A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.567
ANNALEE NEWITZ: SAY WE USE
UP OUR WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM,

35:01.600 --> 35:03.635
AND THEN WE SAY, ALRIGHT,
WELL, WE USED UP THE WHOLE

35:03.669 --> 35:05.604
SOLAR SYSTEM, LET'S
GO OVER TO, YOU KNOW,

35:05.637 --> 35:07.306
THE NEXT SOLAR SYSTEM.

35:07.339 --> 35:11.143
EVENTUALLY, WE ARE GOING
TO RUN INTO A CIVILIZATION,

35:11.177 --> 35:16.282
OR EVEN JUST LIFEFORMS, THAT
ARE ACTUALLY USING THAT MATTER.

35:16.315 --> 35:18.284
N. K. JEMISIN: IF WE DECIDE,
AS A SPECIES, YEAH, ALRIGHT,

35:18.317 --> 35:20.852
LET'S, LET'S TURN MERCURY
INTO A LAWN, I DON'T THINK

35:20.886 --> 35:22.654
THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.956
IT'S WHEN WE GO SOMEWHERE ELSE,
WHERE THERE ARE OTHER PEOPLE,

35:24.990 --> 35:27.793
WHERE WE'RE LIKE, HEY, LET'S
TURN THEIR MERCURY INTO A LAWN.

35:27.826 --> 35:29.094
AND THEY'RE LIKE,
"NO, WE ACTUALLY REALLY

35:29.127 --> 35:30.362
LIKE THAT MERCURY.

35:30.396 --> 35:32.331
COULD YOU NOT?"

35:32.364 --> 35:34.032
NARRATOR: WE'VE
LEFT OUR PLANET.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.435
WE'VE CLAIMED
AND MINED OTHERS.

35:36.468 --> 35:39.271
WE'VE HARNESSED THE
COMPLETE ENERGY OF THE SUN.

35:39.305 --> 35:42.007
BUT WE'VE DONE IT ALONE,
AND ON OUR OWN TERMS.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.744
BUT EVENTUALLY, WE'RE
NOT GOING TO BE ALONE.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.983
ONCE WE EXPAND OUR
REACH AS A CIVILIZATION,

35:52.017 --> 35:53.985
WHO WILL WE MEET?

35:54.019 --> 35:56.922
AND WILL THEY BE
HAPPY TO SEE US?

36:05.697 --> 36:08.967
NARRATOR: EARTH HAS BECOME
UNLIVABLE BECAUSE OF A DISASTER

36:09.000 --> 36:12.070
OR JUST WEAR AND TEAR
AND WE NOW LIVE SOMEWHERE

36:12.103 --> 36:14.573
IN OUTER SPACE.

36:14.606 --> 36:16.875
SO FAR, IT'S JUST
US HUMANS OUT THERE,

36:16.908 --> 36:19.211
BUT IT MIGHT
NOT ALWAYS BE SO.

36:19.245 --> 36:21.747
WE'RE BOUND TO RUN INTO SOME
WEIRD-LOOKING ALIEN CREATURES

36:21.780 --> 36:23.815
ON ONE PLANET
OR ANOTHER, RIGHT?

36:23.849 --> 36:25.251
MARTIN REES: IT'S SUCH
A FASCINATING QUESTION.

36:25.284 --> 36:26.885
IT'S THE QUESTION
I'M MOST OFTEN ASKED,

36:26.918 --> 36:28.720
WHEN PEOPLE KNOW
I'M AN ASTRONOMER.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.857
THE QUESTION, WHETHER WE
ARE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE,

36:31.890 --> 36:34.693
OR WHETHER THERE'S
OTHER INTELLIGENCE.

36:34.726 --> 36:38.364
THERE ARE BILLIONS
OF EARTH-LIKE PLANETS ORBITING

36:38.397 --> 36:40.432
OTHER STARS IN OUR GALAXY.

36:40.466 --> 36:43.502
AND MANY OF THEM
COULD HARBOR LIFE.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.871
NARRATOR: BILLIONS OF
EARTH-LIKE PLANETS?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.106
WELL, THEN IT DOES SEEM
LIKELY THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE.

36:50.075 --> 36:52.711
IMAGINING WHAT THE ALIENS LOOK
LIKE OUT HERE HAS PRACTICALLY

36:52.744 --> 36:54.613
BECOME A COTTAGE
INDUSTRY FOR SCI-FI.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.884
MATT MIRA: NOTHING TERRIFIED
ME MORE AS A KID THAN THOSE

36:58.917 --> 37:02.187
GRAY ALIENS THAT I WOULD
SEE ON "UNSOLVED MYSTERIES".

37:02.220 --> 37:05.190
WHERE PEOPLE WOULD GET
ABDUCTED, YOU KNOW?

37:05.223 --> 37:09.561
"UNSOLVED MYSTERIES", YOU PLAY
THE MUSIC AND IF YOU ARE MY AGE

37:09.595 --> 37:13.899
YOU'RE TERRIFIED OF EITHER BEING
ABDUCTED BY STEP PARENTS OR

37:14.400 --> 37:16.768
BEING ABDUCTED BY ALIENS.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.538
NEGIN FARSAD: I SAW THE MOVIE
"ARRIVAL" AND LIKE I LIKED THE

37:19.571 --> 37:23.909
IDEA OF ALIENS JUST SORT OF
LIKE FORMING IN YOUR FACE.

37:25.010 --> 37:26.244
LIKE, THEY'RE NOT LIKE,

37:26.278 --> 37:28.814
"HELLO, SHAKE MY
HAND, I'M AN ALIEN."

37:28.847 --> 37:31.450
CHUCK NICE: I LIKE THE ALIEN
ALIEN WITH THE MOUTH OUT OF THE

37:31.483 --> 37:33.819
MOUTH AND HIS LIKE LITTLE
TEENY MOUTH THAT COMES,

37:33.852 --> 37:35.554
AND WHY DO YOU NEED
THAT, HONESTLY?

37:35.587 --> 37:37.889
THAT'S JUST A LITTLE
GRATUITOUS, BUT WHO CARES?

37:37.923 --> 37:39.591
IT'S AWESOME.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.729
NARRATOR: SO WHY HASN'T
MR. SPOCK, OR ALF,

37:43.762 --> 37:46.097
OR CHEWBACCA COME DOWN
HERE TO HAVE A DRINK WITH US

37:46.131 --> 37:47.666
AT THE CANTINA?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.668
FUTURISTS ALL HAVE
DIFFERENT THEORIES!

37:50.469 --> 37:51.803
MATT MIRA: I DON'T
KNOW IF THERE'S ANY ALIEN

37:51.837 --> 37:53.171
LIFE OUT THERE.

37:53.204 --> 37:55.173
THE NUMBERS TELL
US IT SHOULD BE,

37:55.206 --> 37:58.344
BUT IF THERE IS INTELLIGENT
LIFE, THEN WHERE IS IT?

37:58.677 --> 38:00.446
WE SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT BY NOW.

38:00.479 --> 38:02.581
IT SHOULD HAVE CONTACTED US.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.850
ANDERS SANDBERG: A DISTURBING
POSSIBILITY MIGHT BE THAT

38:04.883 --> 38:07.018
INTELLIGENCE IS
ACTUALLY FAIRLY COMMON,

38:07.553 --> 38:10.456
BUT IT JUST DOESN'T
LAST VERY LONG.

38:10.489 --> 38:13.825
THE MILKY WAY IS LITERALLY
MORE THAN 10 BILLION YEARS OLD.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.495
THERE COULD HAVE
BEEN INTELLIGENCE,

38:16.528 --> 38:18.697
BILLIONS OF YEARS AGO,
AND WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO

38:18.730 --> 38:20.632
SEE THE TRACES.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.134
CHARLES SOULE: BUT THE ODDS OF
THAT OUR CIVILIZATION IS GOING

38:23.168 --> 38:26.304
TO HAVE STARTED ROUGHLY AROUND
THE SAME TIME AS THEIRS DID AND

38:26.338 --> 38:28.106
IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE ENOUGH
FOR US TO SORT OF, LIKE,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.841
GET IN CONTACT WITH
EACH OTHER, TO ME,

38:29.875 --> 38:31.910
THE ODDS SEEM EXTRAORDINARILY
HIGH AGAINST IT.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.013
ROSE EVELETH: IT'S JUST
SUCH A HUGE UNIVERSE.

38:35.046 --> 38:37.315
OF COURSE IT'S HARD
TO FIND OTHER THINGS.

38:37.349 --> 38:39.451
MAYBE THEY'RE HAVING THIS
EXACT SAME CONVERSATION, RIGHT,

38:39.485 --> 38:41.219
WHERE THEY'RE SAYING,
WHERE IS EVERYBODY ELSE,

38:41.252 --> 38:43.489
LIKE WHAT'S GOING ON?

38:43.522 --> 38:45.791
NARRATOR: EITHER THAT WE MISSED
EACH OTHER BY A FEW BILLION

38:45.824 --> 38:47.993
YEARS OR A FEW
BILLION LIGHT YEARS.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.497
AND THERE ARE OTHER
POSSIBILITIES.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.899
OSCAR AND EVA HAVE DECIDED
TO LIVE IN THE METAVERSE.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.902
WHO'S TO SAY THAT OTHER ALIEN
SPECIES HAVEN'T DECIDED TO DO

38:56.935 --> 38:58.804
THE SAME THEMSELVES?

38:58.837 --> 39:00.839
COULD THAT BE THE
EVENTUAL END POINT FOR

39:00.872 --> 39:03.609
ALL INTELLIGENT LIFE?

39:05.210 --> 39:07.178
PHILIP ROSEDALE: MAYBE, AS
SOON AS EVERYBODY BECOMES SMART

39:07.212 --> 39:09.147
ENOUGH, THEY JUST
BUILD VIRTUAL WORLDS,

39:09.180 --> 39:11.182
AND THEY DON'T SPEND THAT
MUCH TIME FLYING AROUND,

39:11.216 --> 39:12.751
LOOKING AT ALL
THESE OTHER WORLDS.

39:12.784 --> 39:16.087
IF VIRTUAL WORLDS FOLDED UP
INSIDE OF COMPUTERS REPRESENT

39:16.121 --> 39:18.424
SUCH A VAST SPACE
OF POSSIBILITIES,

39:18.457 --> 39:21.560
THEN LOGICALLY SPEAKING, THE
ALIENS WOULDN'T NECESSARILY HANG

39:21.593 --> 39:24.596
OUT HERE THAT MUCH, BECAUSE HERE
IS A KIND OF AN ALMOST EMPTY

39:24.630 --> 39:26.798
DESERT, WHERE THERE'S
VERY LITTLE LIFE AT ALL.

39:27.566 --> 39:29.835
MAYBE WE'RE ABOUT TO START
DOING THE SAME THING.

39:29.868 --> 39:33.338
MAYBE WE'LL NEVER GO THAT FAR
INTO SPACE, OR THAT MANY OF US,

39:33.371 --> 39:35.907
BECAUSE WE JUST KIND OF
GO INSIDE THE COMPUTERS.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.945
NARRATOR: SO MAYBE ALIENS ARE
LIVING ON A COMPUTER CLOUD

39:39.978 --> 39:41.880
MILLIONS AND MILLIONS
OF MILES AWAY,

39:41.913 --> 39:43.949
LIVING THEIR
BEST VIRTUAL LIVES.

39:43.982 --> 39:46.685
BUT WHO'S TO SAY WE WOULD
EVEN RECOGNIZE ALIEN LIFE IF

39:46.718 --> 39:48.219
WE SAW IT?

39:48.253 --> 39:51.990
AND WHO'S TO SAY THAT ALIEN
LIFE WOULD EVEN RECOGNIZE US?

39:52.591 --> 39:54.793
MARTIN REES: I DO WORRY ABOUT
THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE ARE

39:54.826 --> 39:57.128
LIMITED BY THE CAPACITY
OF OUR OWN BRAIN.

39:58.163 --> 40:01.132
WE HAVE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT
THERE COULD BE SOME ASPECTS OF

40:01.166 --> 40:04.002
REALITY WHICH OUR BRAINS
WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.906
MATT MIRA: THERE'S THE THEORY
THAT IT HAS CONTACTED US,

40:07.939 --> 40:10.642
AND WE WERE TOO DUMB TO
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS SAYING.

40:10.676 --> 40:12.410
NARRATOR: IT'S POSSIBLE
ALIENS JUST DON'T WANT TO

40:12.444 --> 40:14.145
HANG OUT WITH US.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.281
DO THEY NOT THINK
WE'RE COOL ENOUGH?

40:16.314 --> 40:18.617
WE HAVE IPHONES AND
WE'RE ON OUR WAY TO HAVING

40:18.650 --> 40:20.852
A DYSON SPHERE,
SO WHAT GIVES?

40:22.420 --> 40:25.924
BRIAN GREENE: YOU KNOW,
WHEN WE WALK BY AN ANT HILL,

40:25.957 --> 40:28.026
WE DON'T FEEL COMPELLED TO
GO HAVE DINNER WITH THE ANTS.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.162
THEY'RE NOT THAT
INTERESTING TO US.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.264
AND IF THERE IS THIS ADVANCED
CIVILIZATION OUT THERE,

40:33.298 --> 40:35.433
WE'RE LIKE THE ANTS.

40:35.467 --> 40:36.735
WHY WOULD THEY COME?

40:36.768 --> 40:37.903
FOR WHAT REASON?

40:37.936 --> 40:40.338
NOT ENOUGH PULL.

40:40.371 --> 40:42.373
NOTHING COMPELLING HERE
FOR THEM TO COME AND VISIT.

40:44.009 --> 40:45.443
NARRATOR: WELL, EVEN
IF THE ALIENS DON'T FIND

40:45.477 --> 40:48.013
US COMPELLING,
I AM NOT TOO OFFENDED.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.115
I'D SAY WE'VE
GROWN EXPONENTIALLY

40:50.148 --> 40:52.083
AS A CIVILIZATION.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.853
WE'VE EVEN MADE OUR
ENTIRE SOLAR SYSTEM OUR HOME.

40:54.886 --> 40:56.788
WE MAY OR MAY NOT
HAVE MET ALIENS,

40:56.822 --> 40:59.958
BUT WE HAVE DEFINITELY
HARNESSED OR USED UP EVERY BIT

40:59.991 --> 41:02.127
OF POWER AND MATTER
WE HAVE AVAILABLE TO US.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.064
BUT WHEN WE'VE DONE THESE
INCREDIBLE THINGS, WHAT NEXT?

41:08.734 --> 41:11.269
TURNS OUT ADVANCED
CIVILIZATION CAN,

41:11.302 --> 41:15.006
IN THE IMMORTAL WORDS
OF "SPINAL TAP", 'GO TO 11.'

41:15.741 --> 41:17.976
IT'S UP TO
US TO IMAGINE HOW.

41:24.716 --> 41:26.384
NARRATOR: SO, WE'VE ARRIVED.

41:26.417 --> 41:28.554
HUMANKIND IS NOW A
SOLAR-SYSTEM-SPANNING

41:28.587 --> 41:31.056
CIVILIZATION, WITH
COLONIES ACROSS MULTIPLE

41:31.089 --> 41:32.891
PLANETS AND MOONS.

41:32.924 --> 41:36.795
WE'VE COLONIZED SPACE
AND PROLONGED THE HUMAN RACE.

41:36.828 --> 41:39.364
THE CRAZY PART IS: WE'RE ONLY
HALFWAY TO ACHIEVING THE FULL

41:39.397 --> 41:43.201
IMAGINED POTENTIAL OF ANY RACE.

41:43.234 --> 41:45.370
ROSE EVELETH: A CIVILIZATION
CAN SOMETIMES BE JUDGED BY HOW

41:45.403 --> 41:48.006
EFFICIENT IT USES ITS ENERGY,
AND THERE IS THIS CONCEPT THAT

41:48.039 --> 41:51.076
SORT OF RANKS CIVILIZATIONS
BASED ON HOW MUCH ENERGY THEY

41:51.109 --> 41:53.979
CAN GET FROM THEIR
SUN OR SUNS AROUND IT.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.981
NARRATOR: ACCORDING TO
SOVIET ASTROPHYSICIST,

41:56.014 --> 41:58.684
NIKOLAI KARDASHEV,
CIVILIZATIONS CAN BE RANKED

41:58.717 --> 42:00.952
ACCORDING TO HOW MUCH ENERGY
THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.690
HE CREATED A THREE-TIERED
SCALE TO DEFINE AND

42:04.723 --> 42:06.692
MEASURE HOW
ADVANCED A SOCIETY IS.

42:09.628 --> 42:11.997
ANDERS SANDBERG: THE KARDASHEV
SCALE IS A KIND OF SHORTHAND FOR

42:12.030 --> 42:14.399
LOOKING AT THE SIZES OR
POWERS OF CIVILIZATIONS.

42:15.100 --> 42:19.137
SO A LEVEL I CIVILIZATION USES
ALL THE ENERGY ON THE PLANET.

42:20.405 --> 42:21.907
BRIAN GREENE: THE
NEXT STEP WOULD BE HEY,

42:21.940 --> 42:25.076
CAN YOU GO FURTHER AND
HARNESS ALL OF THE SUN'S ENERGY.

42:25.811 --> 42:28.213
THAT'S WHAT A DYSON
SPHERE ULTIMATELY WOULD BE.

42:28.246 --> 42:30.949
THEY'D BE A, A BILLION TIMES
MORE EFFICIENT AT GRABBING THE

42:30.982 --> 42:33.719
SUN'S ENERGY THAN WE
CAN POSSIBLY DO HERE ON

42:33.752 --> 42:35.921
OUR LONELY PLANET EARTH.

42:37.455 --> 42:39.625
NARRATOR: AND THE THIRD
LEVEL WOULD BE BEYOND THE

42:39.658 --> 42:43.094
DYSON SPHERE, WHERE
WE'D FIGURE OUT HOW TO SUCK UP

42:43.128 --> 42:45.664
ALL THE ENERGY IN THE GALAXY.

42:46.264 --> 42:48.934
RIGHT NOW, HUMANS
AREN'T EVEN AT A LEVEL ONE.

42:48.967 --> 42:52.403
AND WE'VE ONLY IMAGINED UP TO
LEVEL TWO IN SCIENCE FICTION.

42:53.271 --> 42:55.573
ANDERS SANDBERG: ONE COULD
COMPARE THE KARDASHEV SCALE TO

42:55.607 --> 42:57.308
SOME POP CULTURE REFERENCES.

42:57.342 --> 43:00.912
SO IMAGINE CORUSCANT, A CITY
THAT COVERS AN ENTIRE PLANET IN

43:00.946 --> 43:02.580
THE "STAR WARS".

43:02.614 --> 43:05.050
THAT WOULD BE A
LEVEL I CIVILIZATION.

43:05.083 --> 43:07.418
A LEVEL II CIVILIZATION
WOULD BE A DYSON SHELL

43:07.452 --> 43:08.954
SURROUNDING A STAR.

43:08.987 --> 43:11.623
IT SHOWS UP IN SOME
EPISODES OF STAR TREK,

43:11.657 --> 43:15.060
BUT KARDASHEV LEVEL III
CIVILIZATIONS VERY RARELY SHOW

43:15.093 --> 43:17.663
UP IN POP CULTURE, BECAUSE
IT'S SO HARD TO EVEN DEPICT

43:17.696 --> 43:21.399
WHAT IT MEANS TO
HARNESS AN ENTIRE GALAXY.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.735
NARRATOR: THAT'S RIGHT,
HOLLYWOOD CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE

43:23.769 --> 43:26.271
WHAT A TYPE III
CIVILIZATION WILL LOOK LIKE.

43:26.304 --> 43:27.973
IT'S JUST TOO
BIG FOR OUR LIMITED

43:28.006 --> 43:30.776
21ST CENTURY MINDS.

43:30.809 --> 43:33.144
BUT IF WE CAN'T EVEN BEGIN
TO IMAGINE WHAT A LEVEL III

43:33.178 --> 43:36.648
KARDASHEV RACE LOOKS LIKE,
HOW CAN WE EVER ACHIEVE IT?

43:38.016 --> 43:41.119
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY, BEFORE
WE START ON THIS FUTURE-FORWARD

43:41.152 --> 43:44.756
JOURNEY, CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT
WHEN WE FAN OUT ACROSS THE

43:44.790 --> 43:47.592
UNIVERSE, WE WON'T MAKE
THE SAME MISTAKES WE MADE ON

43:47.625 --> 43:50.996
EARTH THAT WILL FORCE
US TO LEAVE THE PLANET?

43:51.997 --> 43:53.999
ANNALEE NEWITZ: ALL OF THE
OUTER PLANETS WOULD'VE BEEN

43:54.032 --> 43:56.968
CONVERTED INTO THE
DYSON SPHERE, TO BUILD IT.

43:57.635 --> 44:02.140
SO, THE DYSON SPHERE COULD BE
KIND OF AN ECOLOGICAL DISASTER

44:02.841 --> 44:04.843
AT A SOLAR SYSTEM LEVEL.

44:04.876 --> 44:06.778
ROSE EVELETH: SPACE
EXPLORATION IS COLONIZATION,

44:06.812 --> 44:08.780
AND I THINK THAT'S AN
IMPORTANT THING TO THINK ABOUT,

44:08.814 --> 44:11.482
BECAUSE IF WE DECIDE WE
WANT TO COLONIZE SOMETHING,

44:11.516 --> 44:14.820
THAT OFTEN MEANS THAT WE
ARE KILLING AND STEALING.

44:14.853 --> 44:17.055
BARATUNDE THURSTON: PART OF WHAT
WE HAVE HAPPENING WITH THE WAY

44:17.088 --> 44:19.825
TECHNOLOGY IS
UNLEASHED ON THE WORLD,

44:19.858 --> 44:22.160
IS THAT PEOPLE JUST DO IT.

44:23.028 --> 44:25.130
AND THEN THE
CONSEQUENCES BE DAMNED.

44:25.163 --> 44:26.397
THEY COME LATER.

44:26.431 --> 44:27.966
WE DON'T CARE WHAT IT
DOES TO THE ENVIRONMENT.

44:27.999 --> 44:31.737
I MEAN, THE AUTOMOBILE IS
A GREAT EXAMPLE OF LIKE A

44:31.770 --> 44:35.340
SUPER-AWESOME INVENTION
THAT IS KILLING THE PLANET.

44:36.875 --> 44:39.344
NARRATOR: IN OTHER WORDS,
IF WE DO GET TO LEVEL TWO,

44:39.377 --> 44:42.013
THE DYSON SPHERE, WE MAY
SCREW UP THE UNIVERSE THE WAY

44:42.047 --> 44:43.749
WE DID UP OUR PLANET.

44:43.782 --> 44:46.785
AND THAT MEANS HUMANKIND
WON'T LAST UNTIL LEVEL 3.

44:47.953 --> 44:49.587
IF WE'RE GOING TO
LEAVE THE PLANET,

44:49.620 --> 44:52.357
WE NEED TO DO SO
CONSCIOUSLY AND CAREFULLY.

44:53.258 --> 44:56.194
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND
GLOBAL WARMING DIDN'T WORRY

44:56.227 --> 44:59.464
HENRY FORD A CENTURY AGO WHEN
HE WAS INVENTING THE MODEL T.

45:00.465 --> 45:03.601
AND NOW WE CAN CROSS THE
COUNTRY BY CAR IN A WEEK,

45:03.634 --> 45:06.404
BUT WE WON'T HAVE
A POLAR ICE CAP.

45:07.705 --> 45:11.743
CHUCK NICE: SO MY SUGGESTION IS,
WHY DON'T WE JUST TAKE CARE OF

45:11.777 --> 45:13.711
THIS PLANET?

45:13.745 --> 45:15.413
HOW ABOUT WE DO THAT?

45:15.446 --> 45:17.883
YOU KNOW, IT'S
KIND OF LIKE, YEAH,

45:17.916 --> 45:20.418
WHY DON'T WE THROW AWAY THE
DISHES CAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE

45:20.451 --> 45:21.887
WASHING THEM?

45:21.920 --> 45:24.890
LIKE THAT'S THE IDEA THAT WE
HAVE TOWARDS THIS EARTH AND

45:24.923 --> 45:27.058
IT'S, I DON'T THINK
IT'S REALISTIC.

45:27.092 --> 45:29.727
NEGIN FARSAD: LIKE WE SHOULD
SPEND ALL THAT MONEY ON MAKING

45:29.761 --> 45:33.264
SURE EARTH IS AWESOME AND LIKE
LITERALLY NONE OF IT ON MARS.

45:34.966 --> 45:37.235
NARRATOR: WHAT IF WE
DECIDE THAT INSTEAD OF FINDING

45:37.268 --> 45:39.971
NEW WAYS TO EXPLORE
THE OUTER REACHES OF SPACE,

45:40.005 --> 45:41.940
WE MAKE THE
EARTH WORK FOR US?

45:41.973 --> 45:44.609
IT'D CERTAINLY BE A
LOT MORE COMFORTABLE HERE.

45:44.642 --> 45:46.644
CHUCK NICE: THE KIND OF
SPACE TRAVEL THAT WE NEED TO DO

45:46.677 --> 45:48.713
RIGHT NOW, YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE
PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING

45:48.746 --> 45:49.781
IN ORDER TO DO IT.

45:49.815 --> 45:51.883
LIKE, I COULDN'T GO TO SPACE.

45:51.917 --> 45:54.652
IF YOU TOLD ME RIGHT NOW I
HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO,

45:54.685 --> 45:57.522
EVEN TO LIKE THE KUIPER BELT
AND BACK, I WOULDN'T DO IT.

45:58.957 --> 46:00.425
CHARLES SOULE: I LIKE
TRAVELING TO PLACES, RIGHT,

46:00.458 --> 46:02.460
BUT I ALSO LIKE COMING HOME
TO MY OWN PLACE WHERE, LIKE,

46:02.493 --> 46:04.996
I HAVE MY OWN NETFLIX AND
I'VE GOT MY OWN, YOU KNOW,

46:05.030 --> 46:06.898
THE FOOD THAT I'M FAMILIAR
WITH AND ALL THOSE THINGS.

46:06.932 --> 46:09.134
LIKE, THERE'S A REASON WE
DON'T LIVE IN ANTARCTICA.

46:09.167 --> 46:11.269
I MEAN, HUMANS CAN SURVIVE
THERE, BUT IT SUCKS.

46:12.670 --> 46:14.072
NARRATOR: IT'S TRUE.

46:14.105 --> 46:16.507
SPACE IS COOL ON "STAR TREK",

46:16.541 --> 46:20.011
BUT IN REALITY, IT WOULD
INDEED BE VERY DIFFICULT.

46:20.979 --> 46:24.182
AND THAT'S WHY KEEPING
EARTH ALIVE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE

46:24.215 --> 46:26.651
IS OUR MOST LOGICAL
COURSE OF ACTION.

46:27.018 --> 46:28.453
FOR NOW.

46:28.486 --> 46:31.823
THE FUTURE WILL BRING
EXPLORATION: MANKIND HAS BEEN

46:31.857 --> 46:34.459
CHARTING NEW AND
MORE DIFFICULT PATHS SINCE THE

46:34.492 --> 46:36.761
BIRTH OF CIVILIZATION.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.596
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE
WE'RE GOING TO STOP NOW.

46:38.629 --> 46:41.432
LET'S JUST HOPE WE HAVE
LEARNED FROM OUR MISTAKES,

46:41.466 --> 46:44.035
AND THAT WE'LL TREAT
OUR GALAXY BETTER THAN WE'VE

46:44.069 --> 46:47.005
TREATED OUR
FORESTS AND OUR OCEANS.

46:47.873 --> 46:51.242
AFTER ALL, OUTER SPACE IS THE
LAST GREAT UNCHARTED TERRITORY,

46:52.343 --> 46:54.145
FILLED WITH SUBSTANCES
AND STRUCTURES WE

46:54.179 --> 46:56.147
CAN ONLY IMAGINE.

46:56.181 --> 46:59.350
SO GET READY FOR
DARK MATTER, WORMHOLES,

46:59.384 --> 47:02.320
AND PARALLEL UNIVERSES.
