{\an8}A working relationship with
Fetty, can you handle that?

00:34.033 --> 00:35.435
{\an8}There's unfinished
business between us.

00:35.502 --> 00:37.971

I started abusing that.

{\an8}He was telling me
for a plea deal

01:12.705 --> 01:14.607

Finding out that Juelz has
to decide to take a plea deal

02:04.491 --> 02:06.059
or take it to trial

02:06.125 --> 02:09.662

02:09.729 --> 02:11.598
It's times like this

a real and good

Hey, babe...

Hey...

02:17.270 --> 02:19.606
How are you?

02:19.672 --> 02:21.641
I came as soon
as you called.

02:21.708 --> 02:23.776
{\an8}Kimbella called me very
emotional telling me

02:23.843 --> 02:25.645
{\an8}she has some news
about Juelz's case.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.181
{\an8}And, of course,
I had to pull up on her.

02:28.248 --> 02:30.517
We gon' have to sit down and
drink some wine for this one.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.151
Well, I'm here.

02:32.218 --> 02:33.786
Thank you for coming.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.122
We've all seen Juelz's
situation play out

02:36.189 --> 02:38.191
in the blogs
and in the news.

02:38.258 --> 02:39.893
And if these reports are true,

02:39.959 --> 02:42.028
this situation
will affect Kim's family

for a very long time.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.765
Juelz got a call
from the lawyer.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.734
A plea deal is
on the table.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.135
So he could
take the plea.

02:49.202 --> 02:51.671
They'll give him 18 months.

02:51.738 --> 02:56.609
Or he doesn't take the plea
and it's up to five years.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.478
Sometimes that taking
things to trial thing

02:58.545 --> 03:00.346
is not the best thing.

03:00.413 --> 03:03.016
I'm no stranger
to how the legal system

03:03.082 --> 03:04.817
can tear families apart.

03:04.884 --> 03:08.154
My father was incarcerated
for 20 years.

03:08.221 --> 03:11.090
And I remember it
like it was yesterday.

03:11.157 --> 03:14.327
{\an1}I remember my dad also
got a plea deal of ten years.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.763
{\an1}And he didn't and he ended
getting 15 to life.

03:16.829 --> 03:19.299
{\an1}And my dad ended up doing
20 years in prison.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.968
{\an1}So, I'm definitely
keeping you guys in prayer.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.836
I appreciate that.
We need all the prayers.

03:23.903 --> 03:25.104
All of them.

I don't even know
how to explain to you

03:27.073 --> 03:31.110
how I'm feeling about
it because I told him,

03:31.177 --> 03:32.946
"Yo, you have to
get off these drugs."

03:33.012 --> 03:35.381
{\an1}I don't want my kids
to see this (bleep) no more.

03:35.448 --> 03:36.516
I don't wanna deal
with it no more.

03:36.583 --> 03:38.484
'Cause he wasn't
listening to me.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.153
And I feel like
all this is happening

03:40.219 --> 03:42.422
{\an5}because of the drugs.

03:40.219 --> 03:42.422
Because of it.

03:42.488 --> 03:45.158
Him even telling me
in the jail, like,

03:45.224 --> 03:49.262
"Yo, I feel like God put
me here for a reason."

down a dark path.

{\an3}If I didn't

03:53.499 --> 03:56.002
{\an1}make it here then I would've
made it to the grave.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.204
{\an5}Oh, my God.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.204
Like, what?
He said, I did not

03:58.271 --> 04:00.406
know how to stop.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.774
Oh, my God.

'cause it's, like...

maybe I just kind of
needed to really

04:07.480 --> 04:10.350
{\an5}be up on through you some
more so that (bleep)...

04:07.480 --> 04:10.350
{\an1}Right.

04:10.416 --> 04:13.419
didn't happen
the way that it did.

04:13.486 --> 04:15.588
It just sucks.
I-- I didn't--

04:15.655 --> 04:18.057
I didn't call you over
for us to do this.

{\an1}Listen, you called me
over 'cause you needed me.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.695

is okay to do.

{\an4}I've been missing
appointments and
stuff for her.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.737
I got run around and get
everything switched over

{\an1}so she can get
her treatments and stuff

moving up here,

therapy... right?

05:52.719 --> 05:56.289
Alaiya was diagnosed
with hydrocephalus

05:56.355 --> 05:58.291
which is a grade four
brain bleed

05:58.357 --> 06:01.461
due to her being 1.4 pounds
and the traumatic surgery

06:01.527 --> 06:05.298
that I had, her brain started
swelling up with fluid.

06:05.364 --> 06:07.500
So, she had four surgeries.

06:07.567 --> 06:09.836
And she has a VAD shunt
in her head.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.739
And the shunt allows the fluid
to drain down to her stomach.

06:12.805 --> 06:16.676
She has to have speech therapy,
physical therapy.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.977
She has to have
her breathing treatments,

06:18.044 --> 06:19.946
and she has to have
stimulation therapy.

went through and everything.

06:26.853 --> 06:28.154
Just look at her.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.523
{\an5}She's very alert
and doing great.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.523
Look at you.

06:30.590 --> 06:33.359
You were one pound?
No way.

06:33.426 --> 06:34.694
You?

06:34.761 --> 06:36.829
You could fit in my hand,
that's how small you was.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.731
{\an5}You remember
that, Mama?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.731
Yeah.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.733
Remember when I went
in the hospital.

06:40.800 --> 06:41.901
And they told me
she wasn't breathing.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.669
And I went in and...
I was about to--

06:43.736 --> 06:45.505
I was about to kill
somebody in there.

06:45.571 --> 06:48.841
When Alaiya was five weeks old,
we had a scare at the hospital

06:48.908 --> 06:50.777
when she stopped breathing.
And I literally, like,

06:50.843 --> 06:53.346
lost it inside the hospital
room, like, I was panicked,

06:53.412 --> 06:55.782
like, I was about to die,
like, I wanted to kill myself

06:55.848 --> 06:58.518
at the time,
like, at that moment.

06:58.584 --> 07:01.320
If she wasn't there, I wanted
to go, like, that's how I felt.

07:01.387 --> 07:02.889
{\an1}I feel like I would
be lost without Alaiya.

07:02.955 --> 07:05.525
{\an6}You would?

07:02.955 --> 07:05.525
Yes, I think so.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.194
{\an5}So, you found yourself
after you had Alaiya?

07:05.591 --> 07:08.194
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.663
She's doing so good and
everything that they said,

07:10.730 --> 07:12.799
she's doing the total opposite

07:12.865 --> 07:15.168
{\an5}'cause you're a fighter.

07:12.865 --> 07:15.168
{\an3}She is.

07:15.234 --> 07:17.436
You're my little fighter.

07:17.503 --> 07:19.739
So, I'm gonna fight for you.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.141
So you can do
it on your own.

07:22.208 --> 07:23.709
And with God's help.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.679
Anyway, so I have all
that going on and I...

07:26.746 --> 07:29.382
signed the other day,
I forgot to tell you.

07:29.448 --> 07:31.551
Signed what?

07:31.617 --> 07:33.619
Signed to the label, Mama.

07:33.686 --> 07:36.289
Did you have a lawyer
look over it?

07:36.355 --> 07:37.723
Yes.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.723
{\an3}Yeah?

07:37.790 --> 07:38.958
Yes, I did.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.760
{\an3}Okay.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.295
{\an5}And guess who came?

07:40.827 --> 07:42.295
{\an3}Who?

07:42.361 --> 07:44.730
Who popped up?
Mr. Wap came.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.365
Mr. Wap, oh, yeah.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.534
I was telling Shotti
that it's gonna be a kind

07:48.601 --> 07:51.003
of little conflict because
it's, like, he doesn't really,

07:51.070 --> 07:52.605
you know, acknowledge Alaiya.

07:52.672 --> 07:54.307
(Alaiya fussing)

07:54.373 --> 07:56.375
But do you care?

07:54.373 --> 07:56.375
Huh?

07:56.442 --> 07:58.678
{\an5}Do you care?
Yeah.

07:56.442 --> 07:58.678
{\an1}Do I care?

07:58.744 --> 08:00.546
You should move on.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.015
Good, bad or best.
That's the way you do it.

08:03.082 --> 08:05.051
I'm not looking for
a relationship with him.

08:05.117 --> 08:06.953
I'm passed that.
That was two years ago.

08:07.019 --> 08:08.621
{\an1}I just want him
to reach out

08:08.688 --> 08:11.958
{\an1}and check on her,
speak up to her, you know?

08:12.024 --> 08:14.694
If a child is gonna
have a father

08:14.760 --> 08:16.295
that father should
be consistent.

08:16.362 --> 08:19.498
And if he cannot be,
he shouldn't be around.

08:19.565 --> 08:21.300
And that's not a father.

08:21.367 --> 08:24.203
One of the reasons why Fetty
is hesitant of claiming Alaiya

08:24.270 --> 08:27.139
is because people like
Solo Lucci is running around

08:27.206 --> 08:30.042
trying to get cloud off my name,
claiming Alaiya.

08:30.109 --> 08:32.879
Knowing damn well
he's not her father.

08:32.945 --> 08:34.447
Fetty was there at my birth.

08:34.513 --> 08:37.515
He rushed me to the hospital.
He was there when I gave birth.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.485
And then he just disappeared.

08:39.552 --> 08:40.852
He didn't sign
the birth certificate.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.520
They asked him actually
at the hospital to sign.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.624
And he was, like, he was gonna
do it in a little bit.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.925
And he never did.

08:45.992 --> 08:48.160
We have never took a DNA test.

08:48.227 --> 08:51.564
I've asked him to take it
numerous times.

08:51.631 --> 08:53.399
Money is not an issue.
I have my own money.

08:53.466 --> 08:54.734
I'm my own money maker.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.068
So I ain't calling
him for child support.

08:56.135 --> 08:57.970
I'm not trying to put him
on child support.

08:58.037 --> 09:01.107
{\an5}It's not any of that.
I want my daughter
to have a father in her life.

09:01.173 --> 09:02.975
I'm proud of you.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.077
To know that you're
doing all these things

09:05.144 --> 09:06.846
and you're doing it well.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.114
(Alaiya coos)

09:08.180 --> 09:10.016
That's what I want
for my baby.

09:10.082 --> 09:11.550
Nothing but the best.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.686
If not she gonna
stay with me.

09:13.753 --> 09:14.687
She what?

09:14.754 --> 09:16.589
She live at my house...

09:16.656 --> 09:18.024
No, she lives with me, Mama.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.325
Okay, you'll see.

09:21.594 --> 09:23.029
♪♪

09:27.800 --> 09:29.635
(Juelz)
The clock is ticking.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.337
{\an8}I'm about to make the biggest
decision of my life.

09:31.404 --> 09:34.040
And now, of course, I feel
that extra pressure to just

09:34.106 --> 09:35.875
going and providing
and make sure

09:35.942 --> 09:37.476
everything is straight
for the fam.

09:37.543 --> 09:38.878
Thankfully, the court
blessed me with some time

09:38.945 --> 09:41.647
to come to the studio
so, you know...

09:41.714 --> 09:43.616
I'm definitely gonna make
the best out of this.

09:43.683 --> 09:45.818
{\an1}Santana!

09:45.885 --> 09:48.254
I hollered at my bro, Maino
to come chop it up with me.

09:48.321 --> 09:50.222
You know, he did a long bid
so figured he would

09:50.289 --> 09:53.392
be a good person to talk
to about this situation.

09:53.459 --> 09:54.961
{\an5}How you feel, man?

09:53.459 --> 09:54.961
It's cool, man.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.063
{\an1}You know, I had to call you over
here 'cause they got me on...

09:57.129 --> 09:58.698
{\an5}I'da pulled
up on you.

09:57.129 --> 09:58.698
I know.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.067
{\an4}But they got me on these
strict stipulations.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.067
{\an3}I know.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.102
{\an1}I can't even get up
and go to the store right now.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.670
Outside, you know
what I'm saying.

10:04.737 --> 10:07.606
{\an8}You on straight house arrest.

10:07.673 --> 10:10.343
{\an4}They act like I'm
enemy of the state
number one or something.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.446
{\an4}I thought the whole airport
(bleep) was gonna be a fine
type (bleep).

10:13.512 --> 10:15.548
{\an1}Know what I'm saying?
'Cause it's like, y'all really

10:15.614 --> 10:18.517
{\an1}think I sat there and said,
this is what I'm doing today.

10:18.584 --> 10:19.652
"We gonna try to get
this through."

10:19.719 --> 10:21.587
{\an1}And I'ma try to
get away with it.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.724
{\an4}Ain't nobody stupid enough
to do no dumb (bleep) like that.

10:21.654 --> 10:24.724
{\an3}Right.
Right.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.259
A lot of people
think I ran out the airport,

10:27.326 --> 10:29.729
because I knew it was something
in my bag.

10:29.795 --> 10:33.632
No. I was told that higher
authorities had to come

10:33.699 --> 10:36.635
and check my bags, and I knew
I had a warrant in Jersey

10:36.702 --> 10:38.204
for something
I didn't handle.

10:38.270 --> 10:41.374
So, you know, I casually just
walked out the airport.

10:41.440 --> 10:44.043
I found out on the radio
like everybody else that

10:44.110 --> 10:46.312
it was something
found in my bag.

10:46.379 --> 10:50.049
And I'm like, what? How?

10:50.116 --> 10:51.317
You know,
playing with them Fed,

10:51.384 --> 10:53.419
with them boys
is a little bit different.

10:53.486 --> 10:56.722
{\an4}You know, because, you know,
they conviction rate
is higher than the state.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.491
So they coming to play.

10:58.557 --> 11:00.159
And they ain't gonna
be playing fair.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.596
{\an1}Taking a plea and (bleep).
Like, um... 18 months.

11:03.662 --> 11:06.866
{\an1}If I take it to trial, you know,
of course if I win then...

11:06.932 --> 11:08.200
{\an5}we outta there.

11:06.932 --> 11:08.200
{\an3}Right.

11:08.267 --> 11:11.170
{\an1}But if I don't that could go
from like a two to five.

11:11.237 --> 11:14.874
{\an1}So now you gambling with...
with more time.

11:14.940 --> 11:17.043
{\an1}But at the end of the day,
I know I'm not guilty.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.846
{\an1}My thing is the kids, man.
Like, mm-hm.

11:20.913 --> 11:22.415
And they asking me, "Daddy.

11:22.481 --> 11:23.783
{\an1}Why you can't
come home."

11:23.849 --> 11:26.252
{\an1}"I ain't, buddy,
'cause we in trouble now."

11:26.318 --> 11:28.254
{\an1}You know what I mean?
They a little too young.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.022
{\an5}Yeah, see that's...

11:28.320 --> 11:30.022
That's another thing, I'm like,

11:30.089 --> 11:34.560
{\an1}if I go to trial, and I blow,
could be doing like five years,

11:34.627 --> 11:37.797
{\an1}and I'm like, damn, my daughter
would be like 11 years old.

11:37.863 --> 11:41.734
{\an1}My son would be
12 years old.

11:41.801 --> 11:44.003
{\an1}That's a gap.
That's gonna hurt me the most.

11:44.070 --> 11:46.105
{\an1}This is a real
sensitive age for kids.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.041
{\an4}Especially young boys.
Young black boys.

11:46.172 --> 11:49.041
That's right.

11:49.108 --> 11:50.242
That's a fact, bro.

11:50.309 --> 11:51.410
{\an5}Know what I mean?

11:50.309 --> 11:51.410
That's a fact.

11:51.477 --> 11:53.546
'Cause that's the
age we remember

11:53.612 --> 11:55.347
we was getting
in trouble at that age.

11:55.414 --> 11:56.615
{\an1}The age they need us
the most, bro.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.451
That's right.
We do-- They do.

11:58.517 --> 11:59.452
{\an3}They do.

11:59.518 --> 12:01.053
To keep the prisons filled.

12:01.120 --> 12:03.222
They criminalize black
and Latino people,

12:03.289 --> 12:05.291
people that come from
impoverished neighborhoods.

12:05.357 --> 12:07.626
Me having a son now,
my son'll be 16.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.629
It's definitely scary because
it's gonna be a time

12:10.696 --> 12:13.432
when he steps out into the
world, where as I'm not around

12:13.499 --> 12:16.669
and he's gonna come in contact
with police officers.

12:16.735 --> 12:19.872
It's a scary thought,
for a father, for a mother.

12:19.939 --> 12:22.274
I went to jail when
I was 16, 17 years old,

12:22.341 --> 12:27.012
{\an4}for drug related kidnapping
and spent, you know,
a decade in prison.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.147
You know,
so it was different,

12:28.214 --> 12:29.915
because I had
to grow up there.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.184
You know, they put you
in a box. Right?

12:32.251 --> 12:34.053
{\an1}They leave you
in there for years, though.

12:34.120 --> 12:35.688
That's where I
started rapping at.

12:35.754 --> 12:36.956
{\an4}Oh, yeah?

12:35.754 --> 12:36.956
{\an3}Yeah.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.424
{\an5}That's crazy.

12:37.022 --> 12:38.424
Never rapped in my life.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.260
{\an5}Sometimes you gotta
go through hell
to get heaven, baby.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.095
{\an5}That's a fact.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.095
{\an3}You know?

12:43.162 --> 12:46.165
And I know what
that pain feel like.

12:46.232 --> 12:51.504
{\an5}But I know having hope,
having hope, though,
is real.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.005
Faith is real.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.640
You could
live off that.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.775
It's gonna hurt.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.277
It's gonna hurt you,
your family,

12:58.344 --> 13:02.314
{\an1}everybody that love you,
but it ain't gonna be forever.

13:02.381 --> 13:04.717
It's not gonna be forever.

13:04.783 --> 13:06.719
{\an8}Juju is as fake, honey,
as a two dollar bill.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.621
{\an8}You hear me?

13:06.785 --> 13:08.621
{\an7}Huh...

13:08.687 --> 13:10.923
{\an8}Juju, I loved you
more than anybody.

13:10.990 --> 13:12.191
{\an8}Loved? Past tense.

13:12.258 --> 13:13.859
{\an8}Can you guys don't
do this right now?

13:13.926 --> 13:15.127
{\an8}Check your friends.

13:15.194 --> 13:16.529
{\an8}Don't lose your class, Juju.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.464
{\an7}Yo, now this bitch...
(bleep).

13:25.671 --> 13:28.607
{\an8}♪♪

13:31.010 --> 13:32.211
(Cyn)
Jonathan, you look good.

13:32.278 --> 13:33.612
{\an1}Yeah, where you about to go?
Where you finna go?

13:33.679 --> 13:35.214
{\an1}Well, honey, hanging
out with y'all.

13:35.281 --> 13:37.216
{\an1}I was like, I need
to come together

13:37.283 --> 13:38.617
{\an1}because you bitches
with the bodies,

13:38.684 --> 13:40.586
{\an1}like, your snapback
is crazy.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.988
{\an1}No, I'm in mommy mode today,
turn it the other way.

13:43.055 --> 13:45.357
{\an8}These past few months
have been <i> amazing</i> for me.

13:45.424 --> 13:46.959
{\an8}I've been securing the bag,

13:47.026 --> 13:49.728
{\an8}and most importantly I'm single
and loving it.

13:49.795 --> 13:51.363
I'm about to turn 34

13:51.430 --> 13:53.199
and I just want to have a ball
and celebrate

13:53.265 --> 13:55.501
all my accomplishments
with my real friends.

13:55.568 --> 13:57.570
{\an1}What do y'all have
in these bags?

13:57.636 --> 13:59.305
{\an8}I bought me
a little perfume...

13:59.371 --> 14:03.275
{\an7}'cause I'm trying to spice my
love life up just a little bit.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.344
{\an8}'Cause I was like a rabbit with
Joe, hence us having the baby.

14:05.411 --> 14:07.213
{\an8}(indistinct)

14:05.411 --> 14:07.213
{\an8}It was like five times a day.

14:07.279 --> 14:08.581
And now it's
zero times a day.

14:08.647 --> 14:10.149
{\an3}Right.

14:10.216 --> 14:12.551
{\an5}I need my man.
I need my man
to make me feel sexy.

14:12.618 --> 14:14.286
{\an1}I need my man to (bleep) me
like how we used to.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.888
{\an5}Right. Right.

14:14.353 --> 14:15.888
(vocalizing)

14:15.955 --> 14:17.890
{\an6}Yes. Like--

14:15.955 --> 14:17.890
Yes! (bleep) it, bitch!

14:17.957 --> 14:19.992
{\an1}Every man wants that,
so I don't know

14:20.059 --> 14:21.260
what's happening with him.

14:21.327 --> 14:22.461
That's a little crazy.

14:22.528 --> 14:23.929
{\an1}(laughs)

14:23.996 --> 14:25.397
{\an5}(Jonathan)
Anyways, I am planning
a birthday.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.433
{\an4}Okay.

14:25.464 --> 14:27.433
I feel like there's
so much tension

14:27.499 --> 14:28.834
around my birthday already
as it is.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.903
{\an4}Why?

14:28.901 --> 14:30.903
Well, bitch, I know
you have mad issues

14:30.970 --> 14:33.639
{\an4}going on with Yandy,
and I love the both of you.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.639
It's not mad issues.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.375
{\an1}We had a private
conversation over the phone

14:36.442 --> 14:39.144
{\an1}when I solidify we can't
be friends no more.

14:39.211 --> 14:42.481
For the record, Yandy Smith,
no Harris, is not my friend.

14:42.548 --> 14:45.551
A couple of years ago,
Yandy and I were feuding

14:45.618 --> 14:47.653
with Mendeecees'
baby mothers.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.156
At one point in time,
Yandy invited me to show up,

14:51.223 --> 14:54.627
pull up rather, at little
Mendeecees' birthday party,

14:54.693 --> 14:55.628
which I did.

14:55.694 --> 14:56.996
Why is she here?

14:57.062 --> 14:58.664
{\an5}The party ends at 4:00.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.664
What are you
talking about?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.232
The party ends at 4:00...

15:00.299 --> 15:03.235
{\an1}Okay, I can't come here now
without bitches gettin' crazy?

15:03.302 --> 15:06.305
But then when we both
got caught up,

15:06.372 --> 15:08.507
she threw me,
only me, under the bus.

15:08.574 --> 15:11.110
Did you not know that Kimbella
was going to the party?

15:11.176 --> 15:12.511
She told me
after the fact.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.313
And to add on top of that,

15:14.380 --> 15:17.283
this girl has been ghost
for months.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.917
Now, all of a sudden,
she wanna go ahead

15:18.984 --> 15:21.420
and put up a birthday post
like we been speaking.

15:21.487 --> 15:22.721
{\an8}We haven't spoken in months.

15:22.788 --> 15:26.125
{\an8}Who you doin' it for, boo?
It ain't for me.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.626
{\an4}That's it.
Like, it's nothing else
to talk about.

15:27.693 --> 15:29.028
It's not like she's
told me anything.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.329
The only thing I saw
was what was going on on...

15:30.396 --> 15:31.764
{\an5}the blog...

15:30.396 --> 15:31.764
Instagram,
I saw that.

15:31.830 --> 15:32.765
...the whole fight.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.199
{\an1}She didn't call me
the whole day.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.235
{\an1}She put up the post
at 8:00 at night.

15:36.302 --> 15:40.205
{\an4}She's doing (bleep) that
basically is not genuine.
It's fake.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.041
But I figured you guys
weren't in a good place...

15:42.107 --> 15:43.842
{\an5}I don't give a (bleep).

15:42.107 --> 15:43.842
...on your birthday.

15:43.909 --> 15:45.444
I don't give a (bleep)
if we was or we wasn't.

15:45.511 --> 15:48.681
{\an1}Then that was your initiative
to show that you were my friend,

15:48.747 --> 15:50.983
{\an1}to call my phone
and say "Happy Birthday.

15:51.050 --> 15:52.151
{\an1}"I don't give a (bleep)
what's going on.

15:52.217 --> 15:53.585
Happy (bleep) birthday."

15:53.652 --> 15:56.288
{\an1}Don't put up a (bleep) post
for the world to see,

15:56.355 --> 15:58.424
{\an1}"Oh, I'm a good friend,"
at 8:00 at night.

15:58.490 --> 16:00.392
{\an4}Like, I ain't
got the time...

15:58.490 --> 16:00.392
You felt like
it wasn't genuine.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.494
{\an1}No, it wasn't. It wasn't.
'Cause I know her.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.196
{\an1}So, now it's all
about loyalty.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.998
{\an1}Like, I have, like,
no friends right now.

16:06.065 --> 16:08.200
Like, I only have
you two and Juju.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.502
{\an1}But I'm very, like,
got my guard up right now.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.771
{\an5}It's kinda like...

16:10.569 --> 16:12.771
You're having issues
with Juju?

16:12.838 --> 16:14.306
{\an4}No!

16:12.838 --> 16:14.306
Oh.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.141
{\an5}No, no, no.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.141
'Cause she's a very
closed off girl.

16:16.208 --> 16:18.344
{\an1}I thought
she was like that at first,

16:18.410 --> 16:20.245
{\an1}but you have
to earn it from her.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.381
Regardless of what Kim
has to say,

16:22.448 --> 16:25.084
I'm upset with Juju,
and I have every right to be.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.386
I considered Juju to be one
of my closest friends.

16:27.453 --> 16:29.722
So, of course,
I was completely heartbroken

16:29.788 --> 16:31.323
when she stabbed me
in the back.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.525
To make a long story short,
I shared with Juju

16:33.592 --> 16:35.060
that I wanted
to be on the radio,

16:35.127 --> 16:37.763
and she took the concept
of a radio show for her and I

16:37.830 --> 16:41.500
for herself, secured the bag
for herself,

16:41.567 --> 16:42.501
and kept me out of it.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.002
I think it's mad secretive,

16:44.069 --> 16:45.471
and it actually shows me
how little

16:45.537 --> 16:46.905
she values our friendship.

16:46.972 --> 16:48.207
Juju is fake, honey.

16:48.273 --> 16:50.342
Juju is as fake,
honey, as a $2 bill.

16:50.409 --> 16:51.643
{\an5}You hear me?

16:50.409 --> 16:51.643
Huh...

16:51.710 --> 16:52.945
{\an1}See, but then you can
say that about her,

16:53.011 --> 16:54.713
{\an1}but I can't say
that about Yandy?

16:54.780 --> 16:57.983
{\an1}I want to come
to your party, but I mm-mn.

16:58.050 --> 17:00.586
{\an5}It's my birthday.
You guys are my friends,
and I love you.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.521
Like, why can't y'all
just be good?

17:02.588 --> 17:04.189
Like, I want to have my cake
and eat it too, bitch.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.491
♪♪

17:06.625 --> 17:09.795
♪♪

17:16.234 --> 17:18.069
Juju-licious!

17:18.137 --> 17:20.472
(both screaming)

17:20.539 --> 17:23.442
{\an8}Yandy and I are a lot alike.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.042
{\an8}We're always
booked and busy.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.546
{\an8}So I'm glad she was able
to make some time

17:27.613 --> 17:28.714
{\an8}to come meet me today.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.883
I can't help but to feel
terrible

17:30.949 --> 17:33.886
about what Kimbella and Juelz
are going through right now.

17:33.952 --> 17:38.724
And I really want to know how we
can be there for Kim together.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.460
She can use all the support she
can get right now.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.796
{\an7}What's going on?
I feel like I never see you.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.898
{\an8}The last time I seen you
we were booked and busy.

17:45.964 --> 17:48.700
{\an1}I've been booked constantly,
Yandy, every weekend,

17:48.767 --> 17:50.702
{\an5}even throughout the week.

17:48.767 --> 17:50.702
{\an1}Yup.

17:50.769 --> 17:52.004
And I'm ready to mingle now.

17:52.070 --> 17:54.306
{\an1}Well, listen, at Jonathan's
birthday party,

17:54.373 --> 17:56.208
{\an1}you know he always
got the cute guys there.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.876
Jonathan's birthday party?
What party?

17:57.943 --> 17:59.611
{\an1}He's having
a birthday party.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.680
I didn't get an invite to
Jonathan's birthday party.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.882
{\an1}You're definitely invited.
For sure.

18:03.949 --> 18:05.350
Why didn't he call me
and tell me?

18:05.417 --> 18:09.388
{\an1}He... you know, he... things be
going fast, and moving fast.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.956
You're definitely coming.

18:11.023 --> 18:13.358
{\an1}What about Kim? I wonder if she
going to Jonathan's party.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.461
{\an1}I don't know.
I haven't spoken to her.

18:15.527 --> 18:16.662
{\an3}At all?

18:16.728 --> 18:18.096
Not even while
this stuff is on?

18:18.163 --> 18:19.932
I don't know,
I haven't talked to you.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.334
{\an4}It's kind of been
real funny between us.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.334
{\an3}Yeah.

18:22.401 --> 18:24.102
{\an1}But what really makes
it funny for me is

18:24.169 --> 18:25.704
I haven't seen
those babies.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.906
{\an5}Aw...

18:25.771 --> 18:27.906
{\an1}You know how close
my kids are with his kids.

18:27.973 --> 18:30.209
Yeah. You think you
guys can talk or,

18:30.275 --> 18:31.543
{\an5}like, figure it out?

18:30.275 --> 18:31.543
I mean, listen.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.313
{\an4}I got too much love
to ever hate her.

18:31.610 --> 18:34.313
{\an3}Right.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.281
{\an4}Or even to do
the public thing.

18:34.379 --> 18:36.281
Right, right,
right.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.884
{\an4}So when she went
on Instagram talking about,
"Oh, we're not friends.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.186
{\an4}You could put up a post
about me for my birthday,
but you didn't call."

18:41.253 --> 18:44.056
{\an1}I said, oh, okay, I'm really
washing my hands of it.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.924
{\an1}But honestly,
it's really petty.

18:45.991 --> 18:48.227
{\an1}In the grand scheme
of what they have going on.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.863
{\an6}Right.

18:48.293 --> 18:50.863
{\an1}I'm always gonna have love
for her and that family.

18:50.929 --> 18:52.331
We've been through
too much together.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.732
{\an5}Right, right, right.

18:52.397 --> 18:53.732
{\an1}So when this whole
thing happened,

18:53.799 --> 18:56.034
{\an1}of course
I reached out to her.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.569
{\an1}But the first thing
she said was,

18:57.636 --> 18:59.805
{\an5}Oh, you reached out
to the other side
of the family first.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.206
(sharp inhale)

19:01.273 --> 19:03.342
{\an6}Oh, no.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.342
{\an1}I was like, but, Kim,
that's his family.

19:03.408 --> 19:04.877
{\an1}What your family
is getting ready to endure,

19:04.943 --> 19:06.311
I've been there.

19:06.378 --> 19:09.548
{\an4}Then on top of that,
Mendeecees been calling
me nonstop

19:09.615 --> 19:10.949
{\an1}trying to find out
where he is,

19:11.016 --> 19:13.385
{\an1}trying to figure out
if he's okay.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.654
I feel beyond terrible that
Juelz is going through

19:15.721 --> 19:16.922
this situation.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.425
And he might be looking
at some real jail time.

19:20.492 --> 19:25.764
It's crazy how Juelz and Kim
are in the exact same place

19:25.831 --> 19:28.267
me and Mendeecees were in
a couple of years ago.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.669
And as much as I'm trying,

19:30.736 --> 19:35.207
I can't be there for Juelz,
Kim, and even the kids

19:35.274 --> 19:37.042
because Kim
just won't have it.

19:37.109 --> 19:39.845
I've reached out to Kim
via text and phone calls

19:39.912 --> 19:41.713
since Juelz
has been arrested,

19:41.780 --> 19:44.683
and basically, she just
dismissed me.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.652
I don't know how
to be there for someone

19:46.718 --> 19:48.554
that won't let me be there.

19:48.620 --> 19:49.922
{\an1}This is not something
that's easy.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.390
{\an1}This is not just something
you wake up one day...

19:51.456 --> 19:52.457
{\an5}No, it's not.

19:51.456 --> 19:52.457
...and feel like,

19:52.524 --> 19:54.326
oh, I got this,
it's all good.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.327
{\an4}No.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.327
It's not.

19:55.394 --> 19:56.461
{\an1}This is many
lonely nights.

19:56.528 --> 19:57.596
This is many tears.

19:57.663 --> 19:59.164
{\an1}This is many uncertain,
you know, days.

19:59.231 --> 20:00.399
And we need each other.

20:00.465 --> 20:02.267
{\an1}We don't ever have to
be friends like we were.

20:02.334 --> 20:05.037
{\an4}But if you need me,
I'm gonna be here for you.

20:02.334 --> 20:05.037
{\an3}Absolutely.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.905
{\an1}Period.

20:06.972 --> 20:09.841
{\an8}I don't feel the same.
I don't feel sexy.

20:09.908 --> 20:12.544
{\an8}And I want
to get back to us.

20:12.611 --> 20:14.212
{\an7}Me and Yandy are
no longer friends.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.582
{\an8}Mm-hm.

20:14.279 --> 20:16.582
{\an7}She text me,
"I'm here for you."

20:16.648 --> 20:18.216
{\an8}Like, no, you're not.

20:25.757 --> 20:28.594
{\an8}♪♪

20:31.997 --> 20:33.332
Cyn's feeling a way

20:33.398 --> 20:36.702
because I refused to go back
to a hotel with her.

20:36.768 --> 20:38.270
{\an8}I'm in the dog house.

20:38.337 --> 20:39.805
{\an8}I'm getting
the silent treatment,

20:39.871 --> 20:41.073
and she's locking herself

20:41.139 --> 20:43.742
in the poor baby's room
every night.

20:43.809 --> 20:47.479
So this morning, I got
a special treat for my baby.

20:47.546 --> 20:51.183
{\an5}(singsong)
What a beautiful morning
to be a family.

20:51.249 --> 20:52.718
(muttering)

20:52.784 --> 20:55.354
Breakfast in bed.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.923
The more I think about why
things went down like they did

20:57.990 --> 20:59.791
the other day,
she's absolutely right.

20:59.858 --> 21:01.393
I haven't been paying attention
to her.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.061
And I ain't been
really puttin' it down.

21:03.128 --> 21:04.329
And even though I didn't really
like her

21:04.396 --> 21:05.697
fronting on me in public,

21:05.764 --> 21:08.133
I know I need to make more
of an effort.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.435
And I've got more
than breakfast in bed in mind.

21:10.502 --> 21:13.071
When was the last time you
served me breakfast in bed?

21:13.138 --> 21:15.974
{\an7}You're having breakfast
in bed because

21:16.041 --> 21:17.676
{\an8}the chef is off,
and... (laughing)

21:18.944 --> 21:21.046
{\an5}Oh, okay.
I thought this was like,
you know,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.949
Operation Get Cyn Back.

21:25.384 --> 21:28.553
Joey doesn't seem to understand
that our quality time

21:28.620 --> 21:31.256
as a couple is super important.

21:31.323 --> 21:34.292
And not getting that sexual
validation from my man

21:34.359 --> 21:35.861
does not make me feel good.

21:35.927 --> 21:38.196
If breakfast in bed is the first
step to his apology

21:38.263 --> 21:41.233
that I deserve after throwing
myself at him

21:41.299 --> 21:42.567
in these
New York streets,

21:42.634 --> 21:44.036
then I'm cool with that.

21:44.102 --> 21:46.405
But it's gonna take a whole lot
more than cereal

21:46.471 --> 21:48.273
to clean this
spilt milk, honey.

21:48.340 --> 21:49.875
Let's talk about
the other night.

21:49.941 --> 21:50.976
{\an3}Okay.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.344
How you feel about it?

21:53.412 --> 21:54.913
{\an3}I mean...

21:54.980 --> 21:57.082
I know I sound crazy
just yelling around,

21:57.149 --> 21:59.818
I'm not getting any sex.
I need some (bleep).

21:59.885 --> 22:02.320
But, Joseph, I want
some more intimacy.

22:02.387 --> 22:04.990
{\an1}Okay, but the way
to get us there is not

22:05.057 --> 22:07.325
{\an1}screaming to the top
of your lungs in the street.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.228
{\an1}That's gonna bring
us backward.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.463
And I apologize.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.866
{\an1}I apologize for not
recognizing that you put

22:14.933 --> 22:17.669
{\an1}some time and effort and energy
into making sure

22:17.736 --> 22:20.172
{\an1}we had a special
parent sexy romantic night.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.475
That's all I want.

22:23.542 --> 22:25.744
I knew my body was gonna
change after I give birth,

22:25.811 --> 22:27.946
but, like, I gained
a lot of weight.

22:28.013 --> 22:29.848
I don't feel the same.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.950
I don't feel like me.
I don't feel sexy.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.820
I don't feel like
you think I'm amazing.

22:34.886 --> 22:37.089
I don't feel
like we're us.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.858
{\an5}Let me reinforce--

22:37.155 --> 22:39.858
And I want
to get back to us.

22:39.925 --> 22:43.028
{\an1}Let me reinforce
some things for you.

22:43.095 --> 22:45.697
{\an1}You are as beautiful
as you have ever been.

22:45.764 --> 22:48.433
{\an1}And I'm still madly
in love with you

22:48.500 --> 22:49.968
{\an1}even though my actions
as of late,

22:50.035 --> 22:51.136
don't seem to say that.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.738
{\an1}And for that, I apologize.
I'm sorry.

22:52.804 --> 22:55.407
{\an1}But I didn't know.
I didn't know.

22:55.474 --> 22:57.776
Last thing I want is for Cyn
to feel less than.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.212
So if I have to give her
a little bit of extra attention

23:00.278 --> 23:02.914
for where she needs to be
and feel good about herself,

23:02.981 --> 23:04.416
I have zero problem doing it.

23:04.483 --> 23:06.485
{\an1}So I have
a surprise for you.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.053
What?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.421
I took a week
off of work,

23:09.488 --> 23:12.257
{\an1}and I booked us
some vacation time in Cabo.

23:12.324 --> 23:13.291
For real, for real,
for real?

23:13.358 --> 23:14.292
Yeah, it's happening.

23:14.359 --> 23:16.661
{\an1}And vacation
means no work.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.764
Well... some work.

23:18.830 --> 23:23.535
{\an5}What work?

23:18.830 --> 23:23.535

32:16.934 --> 32:17.969
What the (bleep)?

32:18.036 --> 32:20.204
I wanna be mad
at you so bad,

32:20.271 --> 32:21.773
(laughing)
but you look so good.

32:21.839 --> 32:24.575
{\an8}Hi... how are you?

32:24.642 --> 32:26.577
Happy birthday!

32:26.644 --> 32:27.412
Mwah!

32:27.478 --> 32:28.680
(overlapping chatter)

32:28.746 --> 32:31.115
How are you? Hi.

32:31.182 --> 32:32.817
{\an5}Hi.

32:31.182 --> 32:32.817
<i>Felicidades.</i>

32:32.884 --> 32:34.585
{\an5}Thank you.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.585
I came to celebrate you.

32:34.652 --> 32:37.588
{\an4}It's your birthday,
but although I had to
hear from somebody else

32:37.655 --> 32:39.290
{\an1}that you have
a problem with me.

32:39.357 --> 32:40.558
They got
straight to it.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.627
{\an1}Kimberly, you can
back up a little bit.

32:42.694 --> 32:43.995
It's us.
We're good.

32:44.062 --> 32:45.096
{\an8}Back up? I'm here!

32:45.163 --> 32:46.597
{\an8}With you!
It's your birthday.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.599
What I'm assuming is that
she's the one who told you.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.867
No, hold on, hold on.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.469
I sat and had a conversation
with you...

32:51.536 --> 32:53.504
{\an5}Yes, you did--

32:51.536 --> 32:53.504
About how I felt about her.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.673
And you shared things with me
about how you felt about her.

32:55.740 --> 32:57.842
{\an1}So why would you bring her
to my birthday?

32:57.909 --> 32:59.544
{\an1}Wait...
What'd I say?

32:59.610 --> 33:02.380
What the (bleep) is Jonathan
even talking about?

33:02.447 --> 33:05.116
He was the one talking
the most (bleep)

33:05.183 --> 33:07.752
and the only (bleep) about Juju.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.187
Just a very
closed-off girl.

33:09.253 --> 33:11.989
{\an1}I thought she was
like that at first.

33:12.056 --> 33:13.424
{\an1}You have to earn it
from her.

33:13.491 --> 33:14.792
Juju is fake, honey.

33:14.859 --> 33:16.427
Juju is as fake, honey,
as a $2 bill.

33:16.494 --> 33:17.929
{\an5}You hear me?

33:16.494 --> 33:17.929
{\an1}Huh...

33:17.995 --> 33:19.897
I was actually defending her!

33:19.964 --> 33:21.566
Can you guys don't
do this right now?

33:21.632 --> 33:23.167
No, no, I wanna know
exactly what happened.

33:23.234 --> 33:24.769
{\an5}It's your night!

33:23.234 --> 33:24.769
What I said!

33:24.836 --> 33:26.404
You feel me?
It's your night.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.606
What if he wants to get it out?
Let him do what he wants to do.

33:28.673 --> 33:30.441
{\an5}No!

33:28.673 --> 33:30.441
Here's how I feel...

33:30.508 --> 33:31.776
We got class here!

33:31.843 --> 33:33.144
I know you
doubt that (bleep)!

33:33.211 --> 33:34.212
{\an1}What are you
talking about now?

33:34.278 --> 33:35.246
I'm talking about
the class!

33:35.313 --> 33:36.280
{\an1}I came to celebrate
my friend.

33:36.347 --> 33:37.682
{\an1}I didn't say
nothing about class.

33:37.749 --> 33:38.850
(overlapping arguing)

33:38.916 --> 33:40.451
You doubted
that I have class!

33:40.518 --> 33:41.686
So what's your class?

33:41.753 --> 33:43.721
I didn't know Juju
was coming tonight.

33:43.788 --> 33:47.558
Jonathan told me that him and
her wasn't on the best terms.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.994
And, honestly, I have
my own problems with her, too.

33:50.061 --> 33:51.963
You know how things start,
but you don't know how they end.

33:52.029 --> 33:54.599
{\an1}I'm a grown-ass woman,
I know how things end when I--

33:54.665 --> 33:55.800
Well, you don't know
how things end,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.335
because if you approach
the wrong person

33:57.402 --> 33:59.504
and you talking crazy, then it
could definitely escalate.

33:59.570 --> 34:01.139
I'm not that crazy.

34:01.205 --> 34:02.373
What are you doing
defending Yandy

34:02.440 --> 34:03.741
like we in high school
and stuff,

34:03.808 --> 34:05.943
when the three of us
is supposed to be friends.

34:06.010 --> 34:08.713
Talkin' about,
"Oh, things can escalate."

34:08.780 --> 34:10.915
I don't see no escalator here.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.251
{\an5}Check your friends.
Check your friend.

34:10.982 --> 34:13.251
{\an3}Juju...

34:13.317 --> 34:14.918
Don't lose your class,
Juju!

34:14.985 --> 34:16.587
{\an1}Yo, this bitch
I'm about to (bleep) up.

34:16.654 --> 34:18.956
Come on, come on.

34:19.023 --> 34:19.956
{\an1}Like I'm not
with this (bleep).

34:20.024 --> 34:21.759
{\an1}For real,
I'm not the one.

34:21.826 --> 34:24.061
{\an5}She always wanna
be the only one
with an attitude.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.164
{\an1}I'm telling y'all right now,
y'all better get her.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.933
Just because I'm classy
doesn't mean I'm gonna let

34:29.000 --> 34:30.435
anybody disrespect me.

34:30.501 --> 34:33.471
You're dead wrong, you're
ruining your friend's party,

34:33.538 --> 34:34.739
and I'm not the one.

34:34.806 --> 34:36.373
I don't got time
for this (bleep)!

34:36.440 --> 34:38.009
{\an1}(Juju)
You're a has-been.

34:38.074 --> 34:40.311
Take me to my (bleep) car.
(bleep) that bitch.

34:40.378 --> 34:41.913
Oh, I'm a has-been?

34:41.978 --> 34:43.681
You ain't never was.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.716
I don't wanna sit here
and talk to you about

34:45.783 --> 34:47.418
this stuff in front
of all my friends.

34:47.485 --> 34:48.553
I think
we should walk away,

34:48.619 --> 34:49.719
I think we should
talk about it.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.355
{\an4}Fine.

34:49.786 --> 34:51.355
I don't want it
to be like this.

34:51.422 --> 34:52.190
(sighs)
Ai.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.458
What's the beef?

34:53.524 --> 34:55.726
{\an1}I'm not here at this party
for this bull(bleep).

34:55.793 --> 34:57.662
{\an1}I could go home and be
with my (bleep) man,

34:57.728 --> 35:00.398
{\an5}who I don't even know
if he's gonna (bleep)
be here the next day!

35:00.465 --> 35:01.766
{\an1}I want you to know
how I feel.

35:01.833 --> 35:04.902
I spoke with you and Yandy
about being on the radio,

35:04.969 --> 35:07.438
{\an1}and I said, "You know what,
Juju, this is something

35:07.505 --> 35:09.807
{\an1}that I think will be great
for you and me to do together."

35:09.874 --> 35:11.309
You agreed.

35:11.375 --> 35:14.846
{\an1}It crushed my spirit when you
landed the meeting by yourself.

35:14.912 --> 35:18.082
{\an4}I took the meeting in Florida.
You wasn't around, but your
name was mentioned.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.351
{\an1}It felt to me like you,
as my female friend,

35:20.418 --> 35:21.953
{\an1}was just bringing me
my dream job like,

35:22.019 --> 35:24.489
{\an1}"Here, Jonathan,
I landed it for us. Take it."

35:24.555 --> 35:26.190
{\an1}And it broke my heart.
It did!

35:26.257 --> 35:27.859
{\an1}Had you told me,
I would have came.

35:27.925 --> 35:29.227
Listen, Jonathan,
I let you talk.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.628
{\an1}That was what I told her.
It was the secretive stuff,

35:30.695 --> 35:31.796
which she agreed on.

35:31.863 --> 35:33.097
Which I agreed on what?

35:33.164 --> 35:34.398
{\an1}That she
is secretive.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.400
{\an5}Okay, listen--

35:34.465 --> 35:36.400
Yes, I did say that,

35:36.467 --> 35:37.635
but the way that
you're implying it--

35:37.702 --> 35:39.170
{\an5}Hold on, hold on.

35:37.702 --> 35:39.170
So y'all have a problem

35:39.237 --> 35:41.239
{\an5}with me being secretive?

35:39.237 --> 35:41.239
No, no, no, no!
Not-- Not--

35:41.305 --> 35:42.707
We do, we both do.

35:42.773 --> 35:44.008
{\an5}First of all, no--

35:42.773 --> 35:44.008
You both do?

35:44.075 --> 35:45.376
{\an4}Yeah.

35:44.075 --> 35:45.376
And y'all both
talking about it?

35:45.443 --> 35:47.178
Don't (bleep) play
with me right now.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.447
{\an5}I'm not playing--

35:47.245 --> 35:49.447
'Cause that's not what
the (bleep) I said!

35:49.514 --> 35:51.015
{\an1}What the (bleep),
and I'm raising my voice...

35:51.082 --> 35:52.950
{\an4}Damn!

35:51.082 --> 35:52.950
'cause you act like
you can't (bleep) hear me.

35:53.017 --> 35:54.986
What the (bleep) I said
was you have to earn that.

35:55.052 --> 35:56.420
That's what the (bleep)
I said!

35:56.487 --> 35:58.022
Don't be
(bleep) messy with me!

35:58.089 --> 35:59.457
{\an1}You're screaming at me
at my birthday?

35:59.524 --> 36:01.225
I'm the last person that
you need to be messy with!

36:01.292 --> 36:02.627
I don't care, I'ma scream!

36:02.693 --> 36:04.262
I'm gonna say this and I'm gonna
go, 'cause I'm over it,

36:04.328 --> 36:05.563
and if you wanna
be friends, we cool,

36:05.630 --> 36:07.532
if you don't, at this point,
I don't care.

36:07.598 --> 36:09.000
So you don't care if
we're friends or not?

36:09.066 --> 36:11.235
At this point, look at
all this stuff that's going on

36:11.302 --> 36:13.104
about something so small.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.873
{\an1}There you are.
Hi, happy birthday.

36:15.940 --> 36:19.377
♪♪

36:21.312 --> 36:22.980
{\an7}You're Miss Goody Two-Shoes,
your (bleep) don't stink,

36:23.047 --> 36:25.149
{\an7}but guess what,
it stinks more than anybody.

36:25.216 --> 36:26.350
{\an8}Don't be a liar.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.560
{\an8}Hi, happy birthday.

36:35.626 --> 36:38.362
This night has already
been a (bleep) show.

36:38.429 --> 36:41.132
And now, of course,
here come Yandy walking in.

36:41.198 --> 36:43.067
{\an5}(Jonathan)
I've had the worst
birthday of my life.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.569
I really have.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.237
(Juju)
Worst birthday? How?

36:46.304 --> 36:47.705
{\an5}We had the conversa--
I'm telling you
celebrate!

36:47.772 --> 36:49.674
{\an1}We need to squash it, Juju.
It's escalating

36:49.740 --> 36:51.475
over some stuff
with me and Kim.

36:51.542 --> 36:53.277
{\an1}I thought me and you
were good,

36:53.344 --> 36:56.080
{\an1}and now it's like you
wanna fight me or something.

36:56.147 --> 36:57.815
I don't!
I wanna fight you now?

36:57.882 --> 37:00.418
{\an4}How do you think I felt
that you ran and told
her everything?

37:00.484 --> 37:02.720
{\an5}What do you mean
I went and ran and
told her everything?

37:02.787 --> 37:03.988
{\an5}I didn't even know
what was going on,
Jonathan.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.189
{\an1}Good-bye.
Bye, Yandy.

37:05.256 --> 37:06.457
I didn't even know
what was going on!

37:06.524 --> 37:08.192
{\an1}I'm gonna go back because
I feel so bad for Cyn.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.261
{\an4}She's been sitting
over there by herself.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.261
I (bleep) feel bad for Cyn.

37:10.328 --> 37:12.096
{\an5}(Jonathan)
I want nothing more
than for the two of you

37:12.163 --> 37:14.465
{\an5}to sit and converse.

37:12.163 --> 37:14.465
I came here to party.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.467
{\an5}Happy birthday, Jonathan.

37:14.532 --> 37:16.467
{\an3}Okay, okay.

37:16.534 --> 37:18.102
Happy birthday, Jonathan,

37:18.169 --> 37:20.004
Come on,
let's go over here.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.675
{\an3}Bitch...

37:24.742 --> 37:26.477
What the (bleep)
is happening?

37:26.544 --> 37:28.479
{\an1}Oh, my God.
I was having so much fun

37:28.546 --> 37:30.147
{\an1}when it was just you
and me in our nighties.

37:30.214 --> 37:31.349
{\an3}(laughing)

37:31.415 --> 37:33.050
{\an1}This the first time
I'm actually seeing you

37:33.117 --> 37:36.053
{\an1}since we had our conversation
over the phone.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.521
It's just, you know,

37:37.588 --> 37:39.991
{\an1}unfortunate,
everything that went down.

37:40.057 --> 37:42.126
{\an1}Going back
to the whole thing

37:42.193 --> 37:44.929
{\an1}with me pulling up to
the baby mama situation.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.432
{\an1}I pulled up for you.
It wasn't a problem <i> until</i>

37:48.499 --> 37:51.636
{\an1}you sat up there
and let me look crazy.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.571
And I had to take
the fall for that.

37:53.638 --> 37:55.206
That's what you mad about?

37:55.272 --> 37:58.476
A kid's party that you
chose to pull up to?

37:58.542 --> 38:00.411
You know that you
need me right now.

38:00.478 --> 38:03.214
Let's be real.
Put this nonsense aside

38:03.280 --> 38:06.684
and let's get back to friendship
business as usual.

38:06.751 --> 38:08.419
{\an6}Listen...

38:06.751 --> 38:08.419
Fight your own
battles then,

38:08.486 --> 38:10.321
{\an5}if that's the case.

38:08.486 --> 38:10.321
We-- You knew you was
never going upstairs.

38:10.388 --> 38:13.557
{\an1}"We"? No, you-- this is
what you probably thought!

38:13.624 --> 38:15.426
You knew you was never
going upstairs.

38:15.493 --> 38:18.596
{\an1}But I did! For you!
In a sense!

38:18.663 --> 38:20.498
{\an5}You asked me to pull up...

38:18.663 --> 38:20.498
No, listen...

38:20.564 --> 38:23.000
{\an1}...and I pulled up for you
because I was on your--

38:23.067 --> 38:25.269
{\an1}Everybody fights your
battles, and that's it!

38:25.336 --> 38:27.271
Own your (bleep).
Own who you are.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.572
{\an5}I let you talk, right?
Relax.

38:27.338 --> 38:28.572
Own who you are.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.307
{\an1}(bleep) all that, no.
It's not no relax.

38:30.374 --> 38:31.976
{\an1}Because you not about
to do that-- you not gonna--

38:32.043 --> 38:33.911
Did I let you talk?
Relax.

38:33.978 --> 38:37.248
{\an5}(Juju)
Kim... you were
called to attend.

38:37.314 --> 38:40.017
Nobody called you 'cause
they wanted you to fight.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.386
You wanted to look like you was
coming to hold your friend down.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.588
Stop with the foolery.
We do have an issue,

38:44.655 --> 38:46.791
but that, my dear,
is not it.

38:46.857 --> 38:49.460
{\an1}But you still lied!
Stop-- don't be a liar.

38:49.527 --> 38:51.862
{\an1}You can keep playing
this character.

38:51.929 --> 38:54.065
{\an4}You could look like that,
'cause you look like that
with everybody.

38:54.131 --> 38:55.533
{\an1}'Cause you're
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.734
{\an1}Your (bleep) don't stink,
but guess what--

38:56.801 --> 38:59.704
{\an1}it stinks more than
anybody's other (bleep).

38:59.770 --> 39:02.006
{\an1}You know what's up.
Own your (bleep).

39:02.073 --> 39:05.076
{\an1}And with that, until you own
who the (bleep) you are,

39:05.142 --> 39:06.811
{\an1}we don't need to have
another (bleep) conversation.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.713
Good night.

39:08.779 --> 39:10.181

{\an8}(Rich)
I ain't a hater, but you know

39:23.861 --> 39:24.962
{\an8}I got history with shorty.

39:25.029 --> 39:26.130
{\an9}Mya Lee!

39:26.197 --> 39:28.165
{\an8}(all cheering)

39:28.232 --> 39:30.201
{\an8}(Mya)
Who is this
in the building?

39:30.267 --> 39:31.368
{\an8}You know Richie.

39:31.435 --> 39:34.105
{\an7}What's up, what's up,

39:34.171 --> 39:35.206
{\an9}Who's this?

39:35.272 --> 39:36.507
{\an8}This is Sydney Starr.

39:36.574 --> 39:38.042
{\an7}(Sydney)
You should know who I am.

39:38.109 --> 39:39.243
{\an8}I don't know
who you are.

39:39.310 --> 39:40.277
{\an8}I've actually been
famous before you.

39:40.344 --> 39:41.212
{\an8}Yeah,
I doubt that, baby.

39:41.278 --> 39:43.414
{\an8}Why you so--

39:41.278 --> 39:43.414
{\an8}Yo! Stop it!

39:44.648 --> 39:46.250
{\an8}Jonathan said,
"You're secretive."

39:46.317 --> 39:47.852
{\an8}I don't like
the word "secretive."

39:47.918 --> 39:50.488
{\an7}You been leaving stuff out.
We could talk about
the breakup.

39:50.554 --> 39:51.956
{\an8}The more I think about it,

39:52.022 --> 39:53.624
{\an7}the more I feel like
you're being a hypocrite,

39:53.691 --> 39:57.194
{\an7}because you did not
tell us about not signing
your marriage papers.

39:57.261 --> 39:58.462
{\an7}(Jonathan)
My birthday was a (bleep) show.

39:58.529 --> 40:01.298
{\an7}Verbatim, every single thing
that I told Kimbella

40:01.365 --> 40:02.733
{\an7}was what she was saying,
and I'm just like,

40:02.800 --> 40:03.968
{\an8}that's not fair.

40:04.034 --> 40:05.636
{\an8}You really need to
reevaluate yourself.

40:05.703 --> 40:06.804
{\an8}You, too, Kimbella.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.372
{\an8}What I'm doing
is keeping it real,

40:08.439 --> 40:10.007
{\an8}and I'm cutting (bleep) out of
my life that don't belong there.

40:10.074 --> 40:11.976
{\an7}All right.

40:12.042 --> 40:14.779
{\an8}This whole situation has just
been an overall nightmare,

40:14.845 --> 40:17.648
{\an8}and I still don't know what
decision I'm gonna make yet.

40:17.715 --> 40:19.016
{\an7}(Kimbella)
Everything is my fault.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.618
{\an8}The whole time you
say I was on drugs,

40:20.684 --> 40:21.886
{\an8}you said we wasn't together.

40:21.952 --> 40:24.155
{\an7}What kind of (bleep) excuse
is that for a man?!

40:24.221 --> 40:28.192
{\an7}And if that's how you feel,
then... let's end it now!
