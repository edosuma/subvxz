01:37.639 --> 01:40.392
- You gonna help me?

01:40.392 --> 01:41.726
- Of course.

01:41.726 --> 01:43.353
Do I need to know
anything about your dad

01:43.353 --> 01:45.188
before we start?

01:45.188 --> 01:47.565
- No.

01:47.565 --> 01:48.610
Okay.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.824
Dear Dad,

01:55.824 --> 01:56.868
I love you

01:58.868 --> 02:01.246
and thank you so
much for everything.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.166
Happy 70th.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.918
- It's great. It's short.

02:06.918 --> 02:08.252
It's sweet.
- It's perfect.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.628
- Yeah, I know, it's perfect.

02:09.628 --> 02:11.339
Yeah, no, I love it.

02:11.339 --> 02:12.634
I love it.

03:01.306 --> 03:03.259
- We're surrounded by pirates.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.316
- Who is that?

03:53.316 --> 03:55.822
- It must be my dad.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.466
One minute.

04:18.466 --> 04:22.429
- He died in his sleep.

04:22.429 --> 04:31.271
I'm sorry.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.172
- Hey, hi.

04:57.172 --> 04:58.423
- Hey.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.424
- I'm Linda.

04:59.424 --> 05:00.427
- I'm Aaron.

06:43.028 --> 06:43.530
- Hey.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.323
I'm sorry.
- Okay.

06:47.323 --> 06:49.244
- About your dad, I'm sorry.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.038
It wasn't supposed
to happen like this.

06:53.038 --> 06:56.207
And I know we've only been
together for a few months,

06:56.207 --> 06:57.210
but

06:59.210 --> 07:00.465
I'm here for you.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.134
- Okay.

07:06.134 --> 07:06.011
Thank you.

07:08.011 --> 07:13.725
- Yeah. Anything.

07:13.725 --> 07:33.119
- We should go inside.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:33.119 --> 07:34.704
- How are you?

07:34.704 --> 07:36.082
- Well, I'm okay.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.292
You're all grown up, huh?

07:39.292 --> 07:40.502
- This is Aaron.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.837
- Hello.
- Oh, hi, Aaron. How are you?

07:42.837 --> 07:45.131
Welcome to Belize.
- Nice to meet you.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.469
- What about Ben?
- Uh, I don't know.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.057
- You haven't reach him?
- No.

07:54.057 --> 07:56.732
I will call him right now.

08:02.732 --> 08:05.318
- So Mara says you're
like a second mother to her.

08:05.318 --> 08:09.072
- Yeah, she was just
a tiny little thing, yes.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.658
But I'm glad that
you're here for her.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.790
- Yeah, me too.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.730
- So, Ben is

08:41.730 --> 08:44.566
coming in from Placencia?
- Yeah.

08:44.566 --> 08:45.734
- Ben's her brother, right?

08:45.734 --> 08:48.695
- Yes, he is.
- Yes.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.281
- Have you two
been together long?

08:51.281 --> 08:53.616
- Almost a year.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.076
- A year?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.954
That's nice.
- Yeah.

09:10.759 --> 09:11.762
- Shit.

09:13.762 --> 09:15.972
You got sosa beans
in the kitchen?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.140
He's a vegan.

09:17.140 --> 09:18.683
- I can fix him a plate.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.518
- Sorry, thank you very much.

09:20.518 --> 09:23.190
- Thanks.
- You're a vegan? Why?

09:25.190 --> 09:27.026
- That's not a good story.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.652
But,

09:29.652 --> 09:32.489
the fact that I am a
vegan is a good thing.

09:32.489 --> 09:33.241
And--

09:35.241 --> 09:38.703
- You're kind of
strange, aren't you?

09:38.703 --> 09:40.872
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

09:40.872 --> 09:42.874
No.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.543
Well, maybe, but

09:45.543 --> 09:47.004
I know myself, and I know
that I need rules, and

09:48.004 --> 09:49.881
I know that with structure,

09:49.881 --> 09:53.176
I can stay away from
all the bad stuff, so,

09:53.176 --> 09:54.011
it's easier.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.971
- I understand.
- Thank you.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.140
- When they first came here,

09:59.140 --> 10:01.601
she was just a little thing.
- Yeah.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.853
- She was small for her age,

10:03.853 --> 10:05.897
her and her little brother.

10:05.897 --> 10:07.024
They were so troublemakers.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.734
- Still a troublemaker.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.861
- Used to give
her dad a hard time.

10:11.861 --> 10:14.239
There were many stories for her.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.658
- Didn't you two had a playhouse

10:16.658 --> 10:19.911
somewhere on the tea farm?
- Mm-hm.

10:19.911 --> 10:23.249
- Ah, it used
to drive him crazy.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.876
- Mara.

10:26.876 --> 10:30.088
Maybe we can work
out the arrangements

10:30.088 --> 10:32.841
later, like when Ben reaches.
- Sure.

10:32.841 --> 10:35.218
- Yes, but I already made
arrangements with the neighbor

10:35.218 --> 10:36.886
for his wake.

10:36.886 --> 10:39.848
You know what a wake's--
- I don't think Mara and Ben

10:39.848 --> 10:42.434
would wanna, you know,
stay up all night.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.477
I mean, it might be
too much for them, Ma.

10:44.477 --> 10:47.063
But that's how you
can honor your father.

10:47.063 --> 10:49.403
- He's not from Belize.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.906
- Well, he made his life here.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.909
We've got to have a wake.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.704
Remember my uncle?

11:02.704 --> 11:05.540
- Uncle Clarence?
- Yes, Uncle Clarence.

11:05.540 --> 11:08.043
You know, when I was a
little girl and he died,

11:08.043 --> 11:09.961
I didn't go to his wake.

11:09.961 --> 11:11.921
- Wakes
here last all night.

11:11.921 --> 11:15.342
It's the way that we take
watch, so the spirits

11:15.342 --> 11:18.887
don't bother us.
- He did not let me rest.

11:18.887 --> 11:19.929
Every day.

11:19.929 --> 11:23.769
At dusk he would come
and knock at the window.

11:32.150 --> 11:36.989
- I can't believe we're
going to his birthday party.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.385
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

11:58.385 --> 12:00.804
- Your dad
was a great man.

12:00.804 --> 12:03.598
We worked many years together.
- The hospital?

12:03.598 --> 12:05.141
- Yeah.

12:05.141 --> 12:05.185
- Okay.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.104
- Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.615
- You need any help?

13:43.615 --> 13:46.493
- No,
we're good, thanks.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.499
Come here.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.793
- You okay?
- Yeah.

13:54.793 --> 13:57.798
Okay.

13:59.798 --> 14:00.030
Hang on.

15:05.030 --> 15:09.534
- I wonder if he
died in that bed.

15:09.534 --> 15:12.042
- We could sleep
in the other room.

15:17.042 --> 15:39.731
Come here.

15:39.731 --> 15:40.982
Wait.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.525
Wait, wait, wait.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.569
Wait, wait.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.404
I don't think this,

15:46.404 --> 15:47.371
this is hard.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.962
- Why?
- You're wasted.

16:02.962 --> 16:06.645
I think I'm just gonna
put you to bed, yeah?

16:18.645 --> 16:19.855
- Is this

16:20.855 --> 16:28.029
just AA stuff?

16:28.029 --> 16:28.202
- Maybe.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.121
Why do you lie?

16:36.121 --> 16:36.708
Hmm?

16:39.708 --> 16:46.131
Why do you lie about us for?

16:46.131 --> 16:47.970
You lied about me.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.267
Lying doesn't work.

16:57.267 --> 16:58.232
You know that.

17:04.232 --> 17:09.904
- We just lie here?

17:09.904 --> 17:10.281
- Yes.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.285
We just lie here.

17:15.285 --> 17:20.040
Till we fall asleep.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.566
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Dad's bed, huh?

19:09.566 --> 19:10.900
- What?
- Get out!

19:10.900 --> 19:18.241
- You could have
fucking told me, Mara.

19:18.241 --> 19:20.285
- You should get dressed.
- Why?

19:20.285 --> 19:22.287
- People coming to set up, but

19:22.287 --> 19:24.917
I think you already knew that.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.461
- Sorry Ben.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.547
I was gonna tell you.
- Yeah.

19:32.547 --> 19:34.341
When, today?

19:34.341 --> 19:35.843
The day of his wake?

19:36.843 --> 19:38.345
I have to find out

19:38.345 --> 19:39.471
in the middle

19:39.471 --> 19:40.972
of the night at a fucking bar

19:40.972 --> 19:42.599
through the fucking
Belizean grapevine.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.059
Can you imagine that, Mara?

19:44.059 --> 19:46.478
"Hey, mon, I'm really
sorry about your dad."

19:46.478 --> 19:48.021
- Well, I don't know why
it's such a big deal.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.441
It's not like you've
spoken in years.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.693
- Who's this?
- Aaron.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.487
This is my brother Ben.

19:55.487 --> 19:57.322
Ben, this is Aaron.
- Hi.

19:57.322 --> 19:58.782
- Would you like a coffee,
or a tea, or anything?

19:58.782 --> 20:00.285
- I'd love some tea.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.578
She didn't tell you about me?

20:03.578 --> 20:06.706
- Not everything's
about you, Ben.

20:06.706 --> 20:07.583
- Ouch.

20:08.583 --> 20:10.377
So, you know how he died?

20:10.377 --> 20:13.421
- Grace wouldn't tell me.
- No?

20:13.421 --> 20:15.548
- Said he died in
his sleep, or something?

20:15.548 --> 20:17.718
- Mm-hmm. Alone.

20:18.718 --> 20:22.389
- I don't know, I
would assume so.

20:22.389 --> 20:25.058
- When's the last
time you saw him?

20:25.058 --> 20:27.059
- How are you possibly
gonna use that on me?

20:27.059 --> 20:29.354
- You know, you probably
shouldn't start this right now.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.397
- You fucking live here.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.316
- Yeah, and?

20:33.316 --> 20:35.610
- I've been busy.
- Yeah.

20:35.610 --> 20:36.533
I can see that.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.618
Sorry.

20:43.618 --> 20:45.495
Tell me your name again, man.

20:45.495 --> 20:46.831
- Aaron.
- Aaron.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.749
Great to meet you, man.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.418
What's your deal?

20:51.418 --> 20:53.294
Where you from, what do
you do, what do you love?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.047
Tell me everything.

20:56.047 --> 20:57.424
- I'm sorry about
your loss, man.

20:57.424 --> 20:58.800
- It's alright.
- Aaron.

20:58.800 --> 20:59.884
- Yeah.

20:59.884 --> 21:15.233
- I wanna show you something.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.444
- Fucking paradise.

21:17.444 --> 21:18.946
- Wanna come?

22:11.539 --> 22:15.086
- Whoo!

22:16.086 --> 22:17.588
Yeah.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.301
C'mon, man, get in the water.

22:23.301 --> 22:24.469
Get in.

22:24.469 --> 22:26.598
In the water.
- Stop it.

22:28.598 --> 22:29.558
Stop!

22:30.558 --> 22:36.856
- Fuck you stop.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.817
- Stop it!

22:38.817 --> 22:39.902
Stop it!

22:40.902 --> 22:41.447
Stop it!

22:48.243 --> 22:49.453
Fucking stop it!

22:50.453 --> 22:53.581
Stop!

22:53.581 --> 22:55.250
Fucking stop!

22:55.250 --> 22:57.881
No!

23:01.881 --> 23:02.152
Stop it!

23:22.152 --> 23:24.195
- Mara!
- Hey Aaron!

23:24.195 --> 23:28.410
You gotta come here, man,
check out these bats.

23:30.410 --> 23:34.581
Come on, don't be scared.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.584
Got your rabies shot, right?

23:37.584 --> 23:40.173
Cool man, just messing around.

23:43.173 --> 23:46.760
Pretty sure that's why
my dad bought this place.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.387
- Because of the bats?

23:49.387 --> 23:51.599
- Swimming hole, this cave.

23:52.599 --> 23:54.059
It's primordial.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.063
A return to the essential self

23:58.063 --> 24:00.732
and the healing
powers of nature.

24:00.732 --> 24:02.776
You know, that kind of thing.

24:02.776 --> 24:06.070
- What kind of healing powers?

24:06.070 --> 24:07.741
- You don't know, huh?

24:09.741 --> 24:15.747
- I don't know much.

24:15.747 --> 24:18.708
- Mom died when Mara was
11, and my dad lost it.

24:18.708 --> 24:23.213
He moved us down here.

24:23.213 --> 24:26.841
- Sounds like
an interesting guy.

24:26.841 --> 24:28.971
- Yeah.

24:31.971 --> 24:39.187
- What's this all about, man?

24:39.187 --> 24:53.201
- Just trying to understand.

26:18.078 --> 26:23.792
- Where were you?

26:23.792 --> 26:26.800
- Your brother
showed me the cave.

26:31.800 --> 26:33.470
- Did you like it?

26:35.470 --> 26:36.138
- Yeah.

26:37.138 --> 26:38.890
I like bats.

26:38.890 --> 26:42.250
- You do?

27:07.711 --> 27:10.630
- Mara.

27:10.630 --> 27:11.632
Mara.

27:12.632 --> 27:14.634
Linda's here with the will.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.512
So, let's speed up whatever
it is you're doing.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.639
- He's right here?

27:19.639 --> 27:20.482
- Yeah.

27:29.482 --> 27:30.111
Mara's busy.

27:33.111 --> 27:36.448
- Well, I guess I can leave
this with you now, right?

27:36.448 --> 27:37.657
- Okay, good.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.075
Well, it could be awhile.

27:39.075 --> 27:40.785
I could make you some tea.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.620
- Well, we have--

27:59.304 --> 28:00.604
Yeah.

28:07.604 --> 28:08.774
- Did I hurt you?

28:10.774 --> 28:13.360
- No.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.863
It's like high school.

28:16.863 --> 28:21.379
It's like junior high school.

28:32.379 --> 28:35.716
- Do you mind if
I have a minute?

28:36.716 --> 28:37.804
- No.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.377
Take your time.

29:12.377 --> 29:14.963
- Aaron and I are
going into town.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.966
Can I get anyone anything?

29:17.966 --> 29:19.592
- With what car?

29:19.592 --> 29:21.011
- You don't need yours, do you?

29:22.011 --> 29:23.722
- I think you should
go check out the plot

29:23.722 --> 29:25.890
that me and my mom picked out.

29:25.890 --> 29:29.019
- Cemetery plot?
- Yes.

29:29.019 --> 29:36.067
Tomorrow's the funeral.

29:36.067 --> 29:38.695
- Why does it matter
where he's buried?

29:38.695 --> 29:41.574
He only went to
mom's grave once.

29:42.574 --> 29:44.909
- Yeah, a burial
doesn't make sense.

29:44.909 --> 29:46.245
Just burn me up,

29:47.245 --> 29:48.955
cremate me,

29:48.955 --> 29:51.000
spread me in some compost.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.920
- People will be eating you.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.924
- But I'll be dead.

29:59.924 --> 30:01.384
- I know when my dad died,

30:01.384 --> 30:05.055
my mom just wanted
a place to visit.

30:05.055 --> 30:08.892
But, you see a grave, you know?

30:08.892 --> 30:11.481
You do get a sense of closure.

30:14.481 --> 30:17.527
- Yeah, that's
really good to know.

30:19.527 --> 30:22.280
- People need rituals, you know?

30:22.280 --> 30:26.993
There's a reason why
people come together when

30:26.993 --> 30:28.955
someone dies.

30:30.955 --> 30:32.290
- What's this?

30:32.290 --> 30:34.167
- It's the will.

30:34.167 --> 30:36.378
Linda's the executor.

30:36.378 --> 30:37.756
- Of course.

30:39.756 --> 30:42.135
- She lives her, Mara.
- So do you.

30:44.135 --> 30:49.265
- It's true, but
I'm okay with it.

30:49.265 --> 31:03.279
- I'm okay with it.

31:03.279 --> 31:05.241
Dad bought the tea farm.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.909
- What?

31:07.909 --> 31:08.993
- Yeah, I know.

31:08.993 --> 31:14.833
I was shocked when
he first told me.

31:14.833 --> 31:16.793
- Should we go?

31:16.793 --> 31:18.086
- What?

31:18.086 --> 31:19.754
- We don't need to do
everything all together.

31:19.754 --> 31:21.381
- What about the will?
- Ben, quiet.

31:21.381 --> 31:23.174
- People will soon be coming.

31:23.174 --> 31:24.676
- Yeah, what do we need?

31:24.676 --> 31:26.970
Lights? Natural lights.

31:26.970 --> 31:31.183
- You're not driving anywhere,
you're too fucked up.

31:32.183 --> 31:33.435
- What?
- You're on something.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.020
It's obvious to everyone.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.438
- You're not making any sense.

31:36.438 --> 31:40.113
- You're not making any sense.
- I can drive.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.532
- Thank you.

31:47.532 --> 31:51.084
And thank you very much for
taking care of everything.

31:58.084 --> 31:59.919
- What does he mean?

31:59.919 --> 32:01.629
You fucked up?

32:01.629 --> 32:03.214
- I don't know.

32:03.214 --> 32:04.549
I don't know.

32:04.549 --> 32:08.389
- Well, I'm not comfortable
with you driving.

32:11.389 --> 32:15.018
- I took a Xanax.

32:15.018 --> 32:18.229
- Just one?

32:18.229 --> 32:20.106
- Yes, just one.

32:20.106 --> 32:25.362
- I'm not doing this.

32:25.362 --> 32:26.621
Just let me.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.584
Thank you.

32:39.584 --> 32:41.920
- I don't need a sponsor.

32:41.920 --> 32:47.550
- You're careful.

32:47.550 --> 32:48.225
- Sorry.

32:55.225 --> 32:56.189
- I understand.

33:01.189 --> 33:03.904
I just can't sit
and watch you do it.

33:15.286 --> 33:17.664
Is this the tea farm?

33:17.664 --> 33:19.499
- Part of it.

34:03.168 --> 34:06.254
- Looks different in here.

34:06.254 --> 34:08.340
- This was all his.

34:08.340 --> 34:11.634
I don't know if you or
Mara would want any of it.

34:30.945 --> 34:32.661
- Turn here.

34:38.661 --> 34:40.337
- What's this?

34:47.337 --> 34:51.382
- So, I took more than
one Xanax or Klonopin.

34:51.382 --> 34:55.219
There are extra pills in there.

34:55.219 --> 34:57.348
I'm just really tired.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.434
- You lied again.

35:01.434 --> 35:03.853
- Yeah, well, I'm
telling you now.

36:44.454 --> 36:46.213
- No, no, no, no.

36:53.213 --> 36:54.850
Not like this.

37:05.850 --> 37:06.396
Look at me.

37:09.396 --> 37:12.315
Look at me.

38:34.564 --> 38:35.457
- Okay.

38:52.457 --> 38:55.418
- How long has it been?

38:55.418 --> 38:59.088
- Two hours, I guess.

38:59.088 --> 39:00.435
- Oh, fuck.

39:12.435 --> 39:13.603
- What the fuck is
wrong with you man?

39:13.603 --> 39:15.021
- Don't fucking touch me.

39:16.021 --> 39:18.858
- Ben just lie
down, lie down, Ben.

39:18.858 --> 39:20.278
Just lie down.

39:22.278 --> 39:23.698
- I'm good.

39:24.698 --> 39:27.534
- Ben, have a seat.
- Stop touching me, man.

39:27.534 --> 39:29.244
- What'd he take?
- I don't know.

39:29.244 --> 39:31.371
I just saw him drinking.

39:31.371 --> 39:34.165
- Folks are
arriving any second.

39:34.165 --> 39:36.420
- Where's Mara.
- Look at me.

39:38.420 --> 39:39.381
- Ben?

39:41.381 --> 39:42.094
- Come on.

39:47.094 --> 39:49.431
- I don't want this.

39:49.431 --> 39:52.142
All these people coming over.

42:10.405 --> 42:11.448
- Hey.

42:11.448 --> 42:14.242
- Hey.

42:14.242 --> 42:17.495
- Has this happened
before with Ben?

42:17.495 --> 42:21.499
- Yeah, it's
not the first time.

42:21.499 --> 42:23.626
- When are they gonna come back?

42:23.626 --> 42:25.795
- I don't know.

42:25.795 --> 42:27.464
- Do they
usually come back?

42:27.464 --> 42:48.777
- Sometimes, but other times,
my mom have to go after them.

42:48.777 --> 42:49.027
- Mara.

42:50.027 --> 42:50.828
Mara.

42:58.828 --> 42:59.871
- Hey.
- Hey.

42:59.871 --> 43:00.914
You okay?

43:00.914 --> 43:04.083
- Yeah, I'm gonna take a minute.

43:04.083 --> 43:06.043
I'll come find you.
- Yeah, good.

43:06.043 --> 43:07.837
- Okay.

43:31.569 --> 43:34.406
- Your father was a great man.

43:34.406 --> 43:36.866
He helped save my son.

43:36.866 --> 43:38.910
He was in an accident.

43:38.910 --> 43:40.263
Your father was a saint.

43:58.263 --> 43:59.514
- Thirsty?

43:59.514 --> 44:00.642
- Yeah.

44:02.642 --> 44:04.394
- I get it, man.

44:04.394 --> 44:06.438
I've been there.

44:06.438 --> 44:08.482
I know what it's like.

44:09.482 --> 44:11.860
- Yeah, I know, man, I
think we covered that.

44:19.617 --> 44:20.994
- The thing is,

44:20.994 --> 44:23.538
all this pain that you have,

44:23.538 --> 44:29.169
it's gonna kill her, too.

44:29.169 --> 44:30.671
- Yeah, man.

44:31.671 --> 44:35.592
You're right.

44:35.592 --> 44:47.145
You're right.

44:47.145 --> 44:49.731
- We have to
worked together now.

44:49.731 --> 44:51.399
- How?

44:51.399 --> 44:53.902
- The tea farm.

44:53.902 --> 44:55.779
John left the tea farm for me,

44:55.779 --> 44:57.240
well, for Trowey.

44:59.240 --> 45:03.036
I just wish that they would
have seen him how I see him.

45:04.036 --> 45:07.416
♪ I was once was lost ♪

45:08.416 --> 45:11.213
♪ But now I'm found ♪

45:13.213 --> 45:15.674

45:29.312 --> 45:33.567

46:34.794 --> 46:35.837
- To John.

46:35.837 --> 46:37.970
- To John.

46:43.970 --> 46:45.016
- I love that man.

46:48.016 --> 46:50.394
Moved out here to the jungle

46:51.394 --> 46:54.105
with two small children.

46:54.105 --> 46:56.107
Mara,

46:56.107 --> 46:57.109
Ben,

46:58.109 --> 47:01.780
your father is exactly--
- Don't forget about Linda.

47:01.780 --> 47:04.993
Karl, don't forget about Linda.

47:06.993 --> 47:07.952
She's 30,

47:07.952 --> 47:09.287
or 31,

47:09.287 --> 47:12.081
so my mother was definitely--
- Mara?

47:12.081 --> 47:13.083
- Yes?

47:13.083 --> 47:14.001
- Mara, Mara!

47:15.001 --> 47:18.338
Go and lie down.
- Why don't you say it?

47:18.338 --> 47:20.931
Just say it.
- Say what?

47:27.931 --> 47:32.102
- Mara?
- You and dad?

47:32.102 --> 47:35.063
You, you all, does everybody...

47:35.063 --> 47:38.112
Does everybody here
know my sister, Linda?

47:42.112 --> 47:44.155
Before he moved us down here,

47:44.155 --> 47:49.661
my dad would come
on fishing trips.

47:49.661 --> 47:50.374
He met Grace.

47:54.374 --> 47:55.711
- Mara?

47:57.711 --> 48:04.467
- Stop, please.

48:04.467 --> 48:08.555
- Alright, well, I, you know.

48:08.555 --> 48:10.974
I wanna tell a story.

48:10.974 --> 48:12.397
I'm gonna tell a story.

48:17.397 --> 48:18.985
Okay.

48:21.985 --> 48:22.987
Here's one.

48:23.987 --> 48:27.198
My dad was gonna
teach us how to drive,

48:27.198 --> 48:30.243
and...

48:30.243 --> 48:31.079
Sorry.

48:33.079 --> 48:35.041
It was Ben's turn,
and he was like 15...

48:36.041 --> 48:40.211
No, he was like 11 or 12, and
he was really nervous, because

48:40.211 --> 48:43.173
my dad always made Ben nervous.

48:43.173 --> 48:45.759
And he
tried to put it

48:45.759 --> 48:48.052
in gear, and he keeps
stalling the car,

48:48.052 --> 48:49.637
and it was really
funny at first,

48:49.637 --> 48:50.014
'cause the more,

48:51.014 --> 48:52.056
the more

48:52.056 --> 48:53.016
he'd fuck up, the more
nervous he'd become,

48:54.016 --> 48:56.144
and the more nervous
he'd become he'd fuck up.

48:56.144 --> 48:57.065
My dad didn't--

49:01.065 --> 49:10.867
I'm just telling
a fucking story.

49:10.867 --> 49:12.118
So the,

49:12.118 --> 49:14.954
the more nervous he'd become,
the more he'd fuck up,

49:14.954 --> 49:18.875
until finally, he
just totally fucks up.

49:18.875 --> 49:22.045
He just totally, like,
"Mom, the car won't start."

49:22.045 --> 49:24.964
And Ben's like freaking out.

49:24.964 --> 49:26.050
And then, my dad

49:27.050 --> 49:29.886
loses it, like totally loses it.

49:29.886 --> 49:31.262
- Get yourself together, girl.

49:31.262 --> 49:33.890
- He takes Ben our of the
car, and he just starts

49:33.890 --> 49:36.142
thrashing him on the roof

49:36.142 --> 49:39.187
of the car, just
thrashing him, and I,

49:39.187 --> 49:43.234
I had to get out and get
between them, because I,

49:44.234 --> 49:48.446
because I wanted to protect him.

49:48.446 --> 49:52.206
Because I love him.

49:58.206 --> 50:01.626
Anyway,

50:01.626 --> 50:03.837
I got this, this happened.

50:03.837 --> 50:05.631
- Don't.

50:06.631 --> 50:08.174
- And then--
- That's enough.

50:08.174 --> 50:10.385
- And then every time
it happened, he would
give us stitches

50:10.385 --> 50:11.678
in the kitchen--
- Mara!

50:11.678 --> 50:14.556
- Because he's a
doctor, you know, Linda.

50:14.556 --> 50:16.252
That he's a doctor, and so.

50:44.252 --> 50:45.090
- What the fuck!

50:50.090 --> 50:51.593
Throwing me under the
bus wasn't enough,

50:51.593 --> 50:54.094
you have to fuck
with Linda, too?

50:54.094 --> 50:56.056
- People have to

50:56.056 --> 50:59.476
know what he was really like.
- Why?

50:59.476 --> 51:01.853
He's dead, it's over.

51:01.853 --> 51:02.398
- Is it?

51:05.398 --> 51:09.278
- You don't need to share
this with anyone else.

51:10.278 --> 51:11.371
We have each other.

51:19.371 --> 51:22.130
- Why, because we're
both doing so great?

51:29.130 --> 51:32.384
- What's that supposed to mean?

51:32.384 --> 51:33.600
- Please?

51:40.600 --> 51:41.020
- Do you think,

51:44.020 --> 51:45.272
you think anyone

51:46.272 --> 51:49.651
will understand you like I do?

51:49.651 --> 51:51.986
- Huh?
- Ben, Ben?

51:51.986 --> 51:53.656
- That fucking guy?

51:54.656 --> 51:55.200
Mr. AA Wisdom?

51:57.200 --> 51:59.411
Fucking Earnest Prettyboy, you
think he's gonna understand?

51:59.411 --> 52:01.371
You think he's gonna
fucking save you?

52:01.371 --> 52:02.915
- Stop.
- Huh?

52:03.915 --> 52:07.585
There's no one

52:07.585 --> 52:08.007
else.

52:12.007 --> 52:13.509
- Please, let's go.

53:07.270 --> 53:11.316
- It's okay, it's
okay, it's okay.

53:11.316 --> 53:12.320
It's okay.

53:15.320 --> 53:16.864
It's alright.

I don't think he'd wanna
be trapped underground.

55:59.609 --> 56:01.528
- You're all wet.

56:01.528 --> 56:02.029
