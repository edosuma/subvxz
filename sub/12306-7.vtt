WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:03.759
The soho house?
No, I can't.

00:03.770 --> 00:05.169
I have an early
call time tomorrow,

00:05.170 --> 00:08.093
And I've got a ton
of a dialogue to learn.

00:08.100 --> 00:10.660
Why don't we do
giorgio's this weekend?

00:10.670 --> 00:16.006
Ok. All right.
Talk to you later. Bye.

00:16.010 --> 00:17.842
[grunts]

00:20.020 --> 00:22.512
Ohh. Ahh.

00:25.390 --> 00:27.779
Ahh. That's nice.

00:27.790 --> 00:28.951
"Paul, you can't do this.

00:28.960 --> 00:30.382
"You can't show up here
and profess your love

00:30.390 --> 00:34.623
And expect me to forget
everything you've ever done."

00:34.630 --> 00:38.863
Ok. "paul begs."
blah, blah, blah.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.725
"T'll never trust
you, paul,

00:40.740 --> 00:42.959
"and once
the trust is gone,

00:42.970 --> 00:44.131
Love is lost."

00:44.140 --> 00:46.859
"Tears flow."

00:48.040 --> 00:51.476
[music playing]

00:56.050 --> 00:57.745
Emily?

00:57.750 --> 01:00.242
You still here?

01:02.160 --> 01:05.881
I thought you were taking
the night off, babe.

01:10.330 --> 01:12.389
Yummy.

01:12.400 --> 01:14.220
Emily?

01:27.680 --> 01:28.670
Emily?

01:28.680 --> 01:31.684
[door opens]

01:31.690 --> 01:33.840
Where are you?

01:42.030 --> 01:44.419
[floor creaks]

01:48.740 --> 01:50.595
Emily?

02:18.230 --> 02:20.221
[creak]

02:27.910 --> 02:29.002
Aah!

02:29.010 --> 02:30.830
Unh!

02:30.850 --> 02:32.773
Ohh! Aah!

02:32.780 --> 02:35.420
Aah! No!

02:41.820 --> 02:43.413
[screaming]

02:43.430 --> 02:44.181
Ohh.

02:44.190 --> 02:46.989
[pounding on door]

02:47.000 --> 02:48.126
[beeping]

02:48.130 --> 02:51.566
[alarm blaring]

03:05.050 --> 03:07.610
So how goes it
with the child?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.714
Must you torture me?

03:09.720 --> 03:10.778
Did I say, "child?"

03:10.790 --> 03:12.019
I meant very young man.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.647
Of legal age,
I might add.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.788
What's his name again?

03:15.790 --> 03:17.019
Brody.
Brody.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.954
When do I get to meet
the young but legal brody?

03:19.960 --> 03:21.223
Uh, I'm seeing him
later today.

03:21.230 --> 03:24.291
You, however, shall see
him when hell freezes over

03:24.300 --> 03:26.519
With that attitude.

03:26.540 --> 03:28.634
You know
I am thrilled.

03:28.640 --> 03:31.132
Seriously,
how's it going?

03:31.140 --> 03:34.576
It's hot, no-strings fun
like you said.

03:34.580 --> 03:35.979
I follow directions.

03:35.980 --> 03:36.640
Good girl.

03:36.650 --> 03:38.971
And brody?
What's his deal?

03:38.980 --> 03:41.176
Is he fine with it
being light and fun?

03:41.180 --> 03:43.217
He's fine. Please.
He's a child.

03:43.220 --> 03:45.814
He's not a child.
He's just a...

03:45.820 --> 03:49.313
Very, very young
legal man.

03:49.330 --> 03:53.187
Go. Get now.
I'm done with you.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.952
Bye.

03:58.870 --> 04:02.238
Good morning. Jack
is looking for you.

04:02.240 --> 04:03.389
Your mail.

04:03.410 --> 04:05.333
Thanks.

04:31.700 --> 04:34.192
Jack: Hollywood station
called in a home invasion

04:34.200 --> 04:36.862
On an active case.

04:36.870 --> 04:39.305
Actress. Nina preston.
News already broke.

04:39.310 --> 04:42.610
Reporters and paparazzi
are all over her house.

04:42.610 --> 04:45.545
Janice and ben are
already on the scene.

04:45.550 --> 04:47.644
Good.

04:48.880 --> 04:52.248
You ok?
Bad news?

04:52.250 --> 04:53.479
What?

04:53.490 --> 04:54.582
Oh. I'm not
being nosy.

04:54.590 --> 04:58.049
It's big letters.
I can read it from here.

05:01.730 --> 05:04.290
It's nothing.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.496
Let's go.

05:09.270 --> 05:10.340
[siren]

05:10.340 --> 05:12.263
[indistinct chatter]

05:12.270 --> 05:14.466
[camera shutter clicks]

05:21.250 --> 05:22.411
Hey. Let's step back.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.070
Jack: I didn't know
nina preston was

05:24.090 --> 05:27.185
Never seen her show. What's
it called-- "savage shore"?

05:27.190 --> 05:29.284
I haven't seen it either,
but it's a big hit.

05:29.290 --> 05:32.021
It's made her the target
of several stalkers.

05:32.030 --> 05:33.589
She has a huge fan base.

05:33.600 --> 05:34.920
I mean, look
at the paparazzi.

05:34.930 --> 05:36.591
They hunt her.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.498
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.331
Hey, hey!

05:41.340 --> 05:42.967
What do you think
you're doing?

05:42.970 --> 05:43.994
Just going
for a better shot.

05:44.010 --> 05:45.330
You can't see anything
from here.

05:45.340 --> 05:47.263
Take your camera and get
the hell out of here.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.032
Fine.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.506
Check this. I'll be
outside, ok?

05:54.550 --> 05:56.939
Nina's out back,
and she's pretty shaken.

05:56.950 --> 05:57.849
She's with her sister.

05:57.850 --> 05:59.147
Are we looking
for heather miller?

05:59.150 --> 06:00.481
We're locating her now.
Apparently, she was

06:00.490 --> 06:02.049
Released from the hospital
a month ago,

06:02.060 --> 06:03.118
Downgraded
to outpatient.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.484
All right. Well, keep
me in the loop.

06:04.490 --> 06:06.458
I'm gonna go talk
to nina.

06:06.460 --> 06:08.189
This way.

06:10.730 --> 06:12.494
Who's heather miller?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.570
An obsessed fan
of nina's.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.163
Booked on two counts
of trespassing last year

06:15.170 --> 06:17.969
And was diverted to a
court-mandated psychiatric ward.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.735
Delusional,
dissociative disorder.

06:20.740 --> 06:22.538
Violent?
Potentially.

06:22.540 --> 06:25.180
Did nina get a look
at the attacker?

06:25.180 --> 06:27.308
Ben: Neither did
the security cameras.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.017
Check it out. She has
a nice little setup here.

06:30.020 --> 06:32.580
She has a full-on
panic room.

06:32.590 --> 06:37.118
Nina's had some bad luck
when it comes to fans.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.757
The attacker's wearing
a burn victim mask.

06:41.760 --> 06:42.693
What's that about?

06:42.700 --> 06:45.499
It's because paul
burned his face.

06:46.500 --> 06:48.764
In "savage shore."
paul ran into

06:48.770 --> 06:50.590
A burning building because
he thought lily was inside,

06:50.610 --> 06:52.339
And that's when he got
horribly disfigured,

06:52.340 --> 06:54.399
But turns out, lily was
never inside the building.

06:54.410 --> 06:56.037
It was all a ploy
by bruce to kill paul.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.748
Only it backfired
because lily ended up

06:58.750 --> 07:01.242
Falling in love
with paul.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.514
Interesting how you can
work side by side with someone

07:03.520 --> 07:04.749
And you don't really
know them at all.

07:04.750 --> 07:08.209
Let me guess.
You watch "the good wife"?

07:08.220 --> 07:11.349
You're nina's sister.

07:11.360 --> 07:13.021
Yeah. Emily.

07:13.030 --> 07:14.122
Where were you
last night, emily?

07:14.130 --> 07:16.519
I was here till
around 6:00,

07:16.530 --> 07:17.793
And then I had to go
run some errands.

07:17.800 --> 07:19.894
- I'm also
Nnina"s assistant.

07:19.900 --> 07:21.595
Sister and assistant?
How does that work?

07:21.600 --> 07:25.207
I offered to help her after
that girl started stalking her.

07:25.210 --> 07:26.564
Nina didn't feel
comfortable

07:26.580 --> 07:28.537
With strangers
in the house.

07:28.540 --> 07:29.871
Any other employees?

07:29.880 --> 07:32.440
Nope. Just me.
It's safer that way.

07:32.450 --> 07:35.715
Nina's attacker knew
personal things about her.

07:35.720 --> 07:36.972
Lasagna was her
favorite food,

07:36.990 --> 07:38.310
And roses were
her favorite flower.

07:38.320 --> 07:41.039
Can you think of anyone
who knows nina like that?

07:41.060 --> 07:43.449
Yep. Anyone
on the internet.

07:43.460 --> 07:45.485
Nina has a lot of fans.

07:45.490 --> 07:47.720
Some of them go
a little crazytown.

07:47.730 --> 07:50.722
Has she thought about
hiring private security.

07:50.730 --> 07:52.926
I'm looking into it
right now.

07:52.940 --> 07:54.567
Beth: When did you put in
the panic room?

07:54.570 --> 07:57.164
After that horrible situation
with sandra bullock.

07:57.170 --> 07:59.662
You stated that your
attacker was a man.

07:59.680 --> 08:04.732
I guess. Um, I didn't really get a
good look because of the mask.

08:04.750 --> 08:09.745
The body was covered, the
hands had gloves, a big coat.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.240
You don't think it was
that nutty girl

08:11.250 --> 08:12.581
You guys put a wa do you? v

08:12.590 --> 08:15.252
I got a notification that
she'd been released.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.455
We're looking into it.

08:16.460 --> 08:18.758
Has she had any contact
with you lately?

08:18.760 --> 08:21.491
No.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.524
Where would I see her?

08:22.530 --> 08:24.453
I don't really go
out that much.

08:24.470 --> 08:29.135
This is my fourth stalker
in 3 years, lieutenant.

08:29.140 --> 08:31.939
I don't go anywhere
to see anyone.

08:31.940 --> 08:35.808
Listen. I get it.
You know, I wanted this.

08:35.809 --> 08:38.972
I came to |.A. To be an
actress, to be famous.

08:38.980 --> 08:41.278
I'm not crying
a river here,

08:41.280 --> 08:42.770
But...

08:42.780 --> 08:45.943
I should be safe
in my own home.

08:46.950 --> 08:49.112
Jack: Celebrity stalkers
write to their targets

08:49.120 --> 08:50.281
Before approaching.

08:50.290 --> 08:52.179
Janice: Her publicist gave
us access to her e-mail,

08:52.190 --> 08:53.658
But there are thousands
of messages.

08:53.660 --> 08:55.492
It will take us a while
to slog through them all.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.649
I scoured
the internet.

08:56.670 --> 08:58.229
There's hundreds of
forums and chat rooms

08:58.230 --> 08:59.527
About nina
and the show.

08:59.540 --> 09:01.167
She has 3 million
twitter followers

09:01.170 --> 09:02.990
And even more
on Instagram.

09:03.010 --> 09:03.966
So her life is out there.

09:03.970 --> 09:05.961
Her stalker has
too much access to her.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.029
Complete access.
The paparazzi chronicle

09:08.040 --> 09:09.701
Every aspect
of her life.

09:09.710 --> 09:10.905
Sometimes, it can
get out of control.

09:10.910 --> 09:12.969
I'm running background
checks on several paps

09:12.980 --> 09:14.175
With arrest records.

09:14.180 --> 09:15.147
What's the show about?

09:15.150 --> 09:16.675
It's your typical
teen gothic romance.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.341
Very addictive. Her
tv character is in love

09:19.350 --> 09:20.215
With a disfigured man.

09:20.220 --> 09:21.984
It's very
"beauty and the beast"

09:21.990 --> 09:24.311
Thematically.

09:24.330 --> 09:28.392
The stalker may see himself
as nina's savior and she his.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.152
Dinner, candles,
bottle of wine.

09:30.170 --> 09:33.162
I mean, this is like
bad textbook romance.

09:33.170 --> 09:36.561
This kind of display
screams incompetent suitor,

09:36.570 --> 09:39.403
Someone single and lonely,
never been in a real relationship,

09:39.410 --> 09:42.004
Possibly a virgin,
but he's not after sex.

09:42.010 --> 09:44.001
He's looking
for a love connection.

09:44.010 --> 09:47.344
He spends every waking
minute thinking about nina

09:47.350 --> 09:48.511
And their future together.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.739
Like her previous
stalker--heather miller.

09:50.750 --> 09:51.683
Where is she?

09:51.690 --> 09:53.340
They're bringing her
in now.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.385
Does he have access
to send me mail?

09:55.390 --> 09:57.859
That's all I'm asking.

09:57.860 --> 09:59.350
No. There's no
return address,

09:59.360 --> 10:01.385
But it's postmarked seattle,

10:01.400 --> 10:02.595
So he sent it.

10:02.600 --> 10:04.819
Somebody sent it.

10:06.930 --> 10:08.398
Will you please
check again

10:08.400 --> 10:10.266
And call me back
on this number?

10:10.270 --> 10:13.638
If I don't pick up,
leave a message.

10:13.640 --> 10:15.699
Thank you.

10:22.450 --> 10:24.270
[knock knock]

10:24.290 --> 10:26.588
Heather miller
is here.

10:26.590 --> 10:28.649
Is nina ok?

10:28.660 --> 10:30.458
Someone hurt her?

10:30.460 --> 10:32.053
Someone's
stalking her?

10:32.060 --> 10:33.425
You were
stalking her.

10:33.430 --> 10:34.784
I'm not a stalker.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.620
I'm an obsessed
and enthusiastic fan,

10:36.630 --> 10:38.724
But I pose no danger
to nina or anyone else.

10:38.730 --> 10:41.961
You climbed her wall
carrying an 8-inch hunting knife.

10:41.970 --> 10:43.563
It was
a ruby-jeweled dagger,

10:43.570 --> 10:46.835
An exact replica of the
one lily was forced to pawn

10:46.840 --> 10:48.638
In the finale
of season 3 to pay

10:48.640 --> 10:51.132
For paul's
reconstructive surgery.

10:51.150 --> 10:52.003
She's crazy.

10:52.010 --> 10:56.243
They found this one doctor who
agreed to reconstruct paul's face,

10:56.250 --> 10:57.411
But it was
extremely dangerous

10:57.420 --> 10:58.945
Because of all
the nerve damage,

10:58.950 --> 10:59.849
And paul almost died.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.442
He flatlined
until season 4.

11:01.460 --> 11:04.680
The best cliffhanger ever.

11:04.690 --> 11:05.782
You're crazy.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.019
And you've had
no contact with nina

11:07.030 --> 11:08.850
Since you were discharged
from the hospital?

11:08.860 --> 11:11.795
No. I was told
I couldn't contact her.

11:11.800 --> 11:12.870
Something changed?

11:12.870 --> 11:15.191
You're still very active
on the fan boards

11:15.200 --> 11:18.602
Yeah. I was never told I
couldn't be a fan of the show.

11:18.610 --> 11:25.448
At home, watching the season
5 marathon of "savage shore."

11:25.450 --> 11:27.544
Season 6 starts
in two weeks.

11:27.550 --> 11:29.541
Are you gonna tell nina
that you talked to me?

11:29.550 --> 11:31.609
Because I really miss her.
I'd appreciate

11:31.620 --> 11:33.839
If you told her that,

11:33.860 --> 11:36.886
Or I could write it
on a sticky.

11:36.890 --> 11:39.279
She's crazy, but I
don't think she did it.

11:39.290 --> 11:40.985
I'm with jack.
She has issues,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.399
But she doesn't fit
the profile.

11:42.400 --> 11:44.289
I agree. I don't think
what heather's looking for

11:44.300 --> 11:45.722
Is a love
relationship.

11:45.730 --> 11:47.220
I think what she
wants is a friend.

11:47.240 --> 11:48.969
Ben, have you found
any arrest records

11:48.970 --> 11:52.736
There's several, but
there's one pap, total sleaze.

11:52.740 --> 11:54.139
He's been arrested
a bunch of times

11:54.140 --> 11:56.302
For trying to take
pics of nina.

11:56.310 --> 11:57.903
Jack: That's the guy
I pulled off the wall

11:57.910 --> 11:59.469
At nina's house
this morning.

11:59.480 --> 12:01.812
I want to talk
to him.

12:01.820 --> 12:05.347
Nina as lily:
Bruce, what's wrong?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.511
What are you doing?

12:06.520 --> 12:07.919
Man as bruce:
I'm tired, lily.

12:07.920 --> 12:10.412
I've done everything I
know to make you love me.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.182
I can't compete
with a phantom,

12:12.190 --> 12:16.923
And if can't have you, well,
he's not gonna have you either.

12:16.930 --> 12:19.991
Ha ha ha!

12:20.000 --> 12:22.059
Yeah. I should have
known you'd show up.

12:22.070 --> 12:26.769
You're a dead man.
Make that a dead freak.

12:26.780 --> 12:27.770
Bruce!

12:27.780 --> 12:29.509
Paul, careful!

12:29.510 --> 12:33.504
Paul! Paul!
Be careful!

12:33.520 --> 12:34.578
Paul, paul! OK.

12:34.580 --> 12:35.775
Stop it, stop!

12:35.780 --> 12:37.373
Stop it,
both of you!

12:37.390 --> 12:40.712
Paul! Paul? Paul!

12:40.720 --> 12:43.280
Be careful! Aah!

12:50.200 --> 12:51.520
I'm not the guy
you're looking for.

12:51.530 --> 12:56.366
Oh, really? Most paparazzi
jump from celebrity to celebrity,

12:56.370 --> 12:58.099
But you stick
with nina day and night.

12:58.110 --> 13:01.410
What can I say? I've
always had a unique talent

13:01.410 --> 13:02.878
All my energy
on one task.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.939
Yeah. Some would call
that an obsession.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.406
Your wife divorced you
last month

13:06.410 --> 13:08.742
Right after you started
focusing on nina.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.240
What does that have
to do with anything?

13:10.250 --> 13:11.547
It's classic
transference.

13:11.550 --> 13:13.541
You get your heart broken,
then you turn your attention

13:13.560 --> 13:15.813
You spend all your time
following nina.

13:15.820 --> 13:17.879
It's understandable you
start to feel like you know her.

13:17.890 --> 13:19.949
It's my job to
follow nina.

13:19.960 --> 13:21.086
Well, maybe it
started as a job

13:21.100 --> 13:24.149
Next thing you know, you're
breaking into her house

13:24.170 --> 13:25.399
Just to get close to her.

13:25.400 --> 13:27.391
Look. That wasn't
me, ok?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.630
I stick with nina
because my ex-wife

13:29.640 --> 13:31.233
Left me knee-deep
in debt,

13:31.240 --> 13:32.730
And nina's
my cash cow.

13:32.740 --> 13:34.936
A shot of her in
short shorts at run yon

13:34.940 --> 13:36.908
Gets me 500 bucks.

13:36.910 --> 13:38.230
A bad hair day
brings in a thou.

13:38.250 --> 13:41.470
Nina's what they call
in my world a sure thing.

13:41.480 --> 13:46.441
Why is that you get all the
best shots before anyone else?

13:46.450 --> 13:48.418
I got a source, ok?

13:48.420 --> 13:51.117
Someone tells me
where nina's gonna be.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.427
What's his name?”??

13:52.430 --> 13:55.957
Heh. It's the wild
west out there, man.

13:55.960 --> 13:57.951
Tmz's got eye's
everywhere,

13:57.970 --> 13:59.267
I need every
advantage I can get.

13:59.270 --> 14:02.934
You saying you'd rather go
down for something you didn't do?

14:02.940 --> 14:06.240
No. I'm saying
I want a lawyer.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.670
You know, you come
in and out of my life.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.205
I feel like
a booty call.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.269
Really? Oh.
That's funny

14:13.280 --> 14:15.442
Because I feel
exactly the same way.

14:15.450 --> 14:16.940
You did call me.

14:16.950 --> 14:18.782
Ha ha! Ok. Guilty.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.019
I just wanted
to see you.

14:20.020 --> 14:22.887
It's like you're my
own private little toy.

14:22.890 --> 14:26.520
Hmm. I don't have
a problem with that.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.428
You know, I really
like you.

14:35.840 --> 14:38.059
Just as long as you
don't take it too seriously.

14:38.070 --> 14:40.732
This is supposed to be
light and fun.

14:40.740 --> 14:41.730
Light and fun.

14:41.740 --> 14:44.209
Light and fun it is.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.029
Because I have issues.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.405
You don't want to
get too close.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.047
Is this--
is this too close?

14:49.050 --> 14:49.972
No.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.311
Is this?
No.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.414
It's perfect.

14:57.490 --> 14:58.651
Ahh.

14:58.660 --> 15:01.049
We all have issues.

15:06.600 --> 15:09.069
I have to go to work.

15:09.900 --> 15:12.164
Pbbbb.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.571
I'm gonna have
a shower.

15:16.580 --> 15:17.672
Care to join me?

15:17.680 --> 15:21.105
Actually, I, uh,
I should run, too.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.179
There's a midnight showing
of "chinatown"

15:23.180 --> 15:26.684
Tomorrow night at the
vista if you're interested.

15:26.690 --> 15:27.543
Yeah. Sounds great.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.019
We close at 11:00.
I'll meet you there.

15:32.930 --> 15:36.525
[door shuts]

15:36.530 --> 15:39.761
[shower running]

16:04.430 --> 16:06.057
Janice: I subpoenaed
eddie gaines' bank records.

16:06.060 --> 16:09.394
He's been wiring 10% of every
photo fee to an external account.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.789
So he was telling the
truth about his source.

16:11.800 --> 16:13.097
Jack: Still don't
like him.

16:13.100 --> 16:15.159
Guy's a parasite,
a legal stalker.

16:15.170 --> 16:18.094
Janice, can you track
this external account?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.236
Give me a minute.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.605
Whoever the source
is, he knew about

16:20.610 --> 16:22.408
The home invasion at
nina's before anyone else did.

16:22.410 --> 16:25.505
Why would nina's stalker
tip off the paparazzi?

16:25.510 --> 16:26.909
Same reason why
nhina would--

16:26.920 --> 16:28.069
Attention,
notoriety.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.412
Money. Most celebrity
stalkers have a hard time

16:30.420 --> 16:32.787
Holding on
to a steady job.

16:32.790 --> 16:35.509
Well, I'll be damned.

16:35.520 --> 16:38.490
You won't believe
who it is.

16:39.860 --> 16:41.589
[sighs]

16:41.600 --> 16:43.659
You're our leak,
emily.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.093
Well, if I hadn't
helped him,

16:46.100 --> 16:47.693
He would have gotten
the photo some other way.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.034
This way, nina gets the
publicity, and I get the cash.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.110
It's win-win.

16:52.110 --> 16:53.760
You put your sister
in danger.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.272
Guys like eddie gaines will
do whatever it takes to get paid.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.841
That's exactly why
I chose him.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.848
You really resent
her, don't you?

17:03.850 --> 17:05.840
You don't know anything
about our relationship.

17:05.849 --> 17:08.887
No, but I do know what
it's like when sister's don't

17:08.890 --> 17:11.313
Protect each other.

17:11.329 --> 17:13.287
Well, nina was always
the gifted one.

17:13.290 --> 17:17.295
She was destined
for greatness.

17:17.300 --> 17:20.190
That must have been
hard to compete with.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.329
Everything comes easy
for nina.

17:23.339 --> 17:26.207
Look. I get it. You
do the job of 6 people.

17:26.210 --> 17:28.531
Nina has no idea
what you do for her.

17:28.540 --> 17:32.477
I took the job because
she needed my help.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.847
I had a life
back in ohio,

17:34.850 --> 17:38.377
And I left it
all behind for her.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.642
Why not just leave?

17:39.650 --> 17:40.811
Easier said than done.

17:40.820 --> 17:42.549
I can't afford to.

17:42.560 --> 17:44.983
So you make a deal
with eddie gaines.

17:44.990 --> 17:47.322
I just want
my life back.

17:47.330 --> 17:52.496
That money is the only
way it's ever gonna happen.

17:52.500 --> 17:55.435
Nina: You put my life
in danger for

17:55.440 --> 17:57.397
A little bit
of extra cash?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.162
What kind of sister
does that?

17:59.170 --> 18:03.403
I gave up everything
to help you.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.502
Oh.

18:04.510 --> 18:05.773
I had a good job
in ohio,

18:05.780 --> 18:06.850
I had a good life.

18:06.850 --> 18:11.447
You wanted hollywood,
not me.

18:11.450 --> 18:15.751
You need to leave.
I can't look at you.

18:19.090 --> 18:20.728
That's great
because you know what?

18:20.730 --> 18:25.520
It's all about you
all the time.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.532
Selfish bitch.

18:34.540 --> 18:37.703
I can't stand her.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.815
No, no, no, no!

18:51.830 --> 18:53.457
Need some help?

18:53.460 --> 18:56.555
No. I'm just gonna
call aaa.

18:56.560 --> 18:59.166
It will take them
over an hour to get here,

18:59.170 --> 19:01.662
And I've got a jack.

19:01.670 --> 19:06.301
Really? Thank you.

19:11.580 --> 19:13.469
Thank you again
so much.

19:13.480 --> 19:15.517
Right.

19:19.250 --> 19:22.618
Were you just coming
from nina preston's house?

19:22.620 --> 19:25.829
No. I don't
think so.

19:25.830 --> 19:28.583
Heh. I get it.

19:28.600 --> 19:34.266
You wouldn't say
for privacy reasons, right?

19:35.670 --> 19:36.762
Do you live
around here?

19:36.770 --> 19:39.705
I don't think I've
seen you before.

19:39.710 --> 19:42.680
I'm just visiting
someone.

19:43.540 --> 19:46.544
I wouldn't do
that, emily.

19:47.880 --> 19:49.370
What do you want?

19:49.380 --> 19:52.441
I want to be nicer
to nina.

19:52.450 --> 19:55.511
You've hurt her.,
I know what you did.

19:55.520 --> 19:57.318
I can't let you
get away with that.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.616
No!

19:58.630 --> 20:01.122
Aah! Aah! No! No!

20:01.130 --> 20:03.997
No! No!

20:04.000 --> 20:06.799
Nina! Nina!

20:06.800 --> 20:08.393
Aah!

20:08.400 --> 20:10.391
[tires squeal]

20:11.540 --> 20:13.838
Oht

20:13.840 --> 20:17.777
Help! Somebody!
Are you ok?

20:22.320 --> 20:24.140
Emily: He said
I'd hurt nina.

20:24.150 --> 20:26.016
That's when I knew
he'd been watching us.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.079
Have you ever seen
this guy before?

20:28.090 --> 20:28.841
Never.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.009
Can you describe him?

20:30.020 --> 20:33.320
Late 20s, early 30s,
brown hair,

20:33.330 --> 20:36.152
A sketch artist
IS gonna come in

20:36.160 --> 20:40.597
Try to remember
as much detail as possible.

20:41.500 --> 20:46.233
I deserve this after
what I did to nina.

20:46.240 --> 20:48.663
Nobody deserves this.

20:50.840 --> 20:54.401
Reed is arranging
24-hour protection.

20:54.420 --> 20:57.276
So you really think this
guy could be my stalker?

20:57.290 --> 21:00.544
We're not sure yet.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.586
Emily and I had
a really bad fight.

21:03.590 --> 21:05.456
I said some things.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.019
We never used
to be this way.

21:07.030 --> 21:09.021
We used to be
best friends, you know?

21:09.030 --> 21:11.727
Why does your sister
work for you?

21:11.730 --> 21:16.031
I needed her. I moved
to |.A., I was all alone.

21:16.040 --> 21:19.305
Having her here
was nice, you know?

21:19.310 --> 21:21.369
She's my family.
I trusted her.

21:21.380 --> 21:25.601
Yeah, but family can be
tough, especially sisters.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.544
People can disappoint
you, nina,

21:27.550 --> 21:30.247
But they can also
surprise you.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.514
I know she loves you.

21:34.450 --> 21:37.215
[beeping]

21:37.230 --> 21:39.653
[beeping stops]

21:59.910 --> 22:03.141
[music playing]

23:02.180 --> 23:07.744
Ben: The sketch artist sent over
the drawing of emily's attacker.

23:07.750 --> 23:08.808
So this is our guy.

23:08.820 --> 23:09.810
I compared it
against all

23:09.820 --> 23:11.811
The paparazzi mug
shots we have on file.

23:11.820 --> 23:12.685
Nothing close.

23:12.690 --> 23:13.816
Get this
to nina's people.

23:13.820 --> 23:14.981
Tell them to be
on the lookout.

23:14.990 --> 23:17.482
I think I found
something.

23:17.860 --> 23:19.055
The attack the house,
where the stalker

23:19.060 --> 23:20.550
Made dinner for nina,
was right out

23:20.560 --> 23:23.052
Of an episode
of savage shore.

23:25.330 --> 23:27.594
What is this?

23:27.600 --> 23:28.726
An apology.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.889
You shouldn't
be here, paul.

23:29.900 --> 23:31.061
See, I thought it
was a coincidence,

23:31.070 --> 23:33.368
But then when emily
was attacked, I knew.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.839
Make that
a dead freak.

23:35.840 --> 23:38.502
Bruce! Paul, careful.

23:38.510 --> 23:42.845
Janice: Our stalker
used a tire iron. See?

23:42.850 --> 23:44.511
He's reenacting
scenes from the show.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.739
From the point of view of
the guy with the burned face.

23:46.750 --> 23:48.411
Paul. His name's paul.

23:48.420 --> 23:49.854
Our stalker identifies
with paul because

23:49.860 --> 23:51.510
He's different,
an outsider?

23:51.530 --> 23:53.385
Is that right?
Probably like our guy.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.381
Nina's character...
Lily.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.428
Lily is in love with paul
in spite of his deformity?

23:59.430 --> 24:02.434
Our stalker is fixated
on hina because he feels

24:02.440 --> 24:06.661
She's the only one who
sees past his imperfections.

24:14.050 --> 24:14.949
I made your
favorite,

24:14.950 --> 24:16.714
Breakfast sandwich
on wheat toast.

24:16.720 --> 24:19.781
You forgot to cut
the crusts off.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.215
Now I don't like you
working the late shift.

24:23.220 --> 24:26.656
I hardly ever
get to see you.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.554
Well, I'm not sure
about that outfit.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.925
It's not appropriate
business attire.

24:33.940 --> 24:35.624
I wear an apron.
It's fine.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.893
Oh, stay off the 405.
There's construction,

24:37.910 --> 24:39.605
And call me
when you get there.

24:39.610 --> 24:40.509
I will!

24:40.510 --> 24:43.036
Don't take that tone
with me, young man.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.071
I'm sorry, mom.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.720
You forgot your pills.

24:57.590 --> 25:00.082
I love you, dear.

25:00.090 --> 25:02.024
I love you, too.

25:06.000 --> 25:07.923
"I've been a fan
of your show for a long time.

25:07.940 --> 25:09.260
"The characters
really speak to me.

25:09.270 --> 25:11.329
"Paul and I could be
the same person.

25:11.340 --> 25:13.763
"Are you my lily?
I think we're meant to be.

25:13.770 --> 25:15.534
Destiny will draw
us together."

25:15.540 --> 25:16.871
Is this
the only e-mail that fits

25:16.880 --> 25:17.779
The search parameters?

25:17.780 --> 25:18.975
There was a guy
in hong kong

25:18.980 --> 25:22.348
But this is the only one within
a hundred-mile radius of |.A.

25:22.350 --> 25:23.977
Janice: It sounds like
to could be our guy.

25:23.990 --> 25:25.378
And he just sent
the one e-mail?

25:25.390 --> 25:26.642
It's the only one
I found.

25:26.650 --> 25:29.142
Seems weird he would
only write to nina once.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.389
Jack: He's impatient.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.119
When he didn't hear
back from her immediately,

25:32.130 --> 25:33.450
He decided to
show up at her house.

25:33.460 --> 25:34.780
You located the person
who sent this yet?

25:34.800 --> 25:38.498
His name is robert dalton,
33, lives in el segundo.

25:38.500 --> 25:39.990
We should
check it out.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.799
E-mail us everything
you can find on this guy.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.132
I don't believe it.

25:45.140 --> 25:47.666
He would never do
anything like that.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.478
Your son's lying
to you, mrs. Dalton.

25:49.480 --> 25:51.972
We called the store. He
was fired over a month ago.

25:51.980 --> 25:54.972
Well, that can't be.
He told me he was working.

25:54.980 --> 25:56.869
Where was he
the night before last?

25:56.880 --> 25:59.315
Uh, he went to see
a movie.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.311
What movie?

26:01.320 --> 26:02.879
Uh...
He didn't say?

26:02.890 --> 26:05.382
No. He did not say.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.157
Look at this.

26:44.930 --> 26:48.969
Robbie's been monitoring
nina's twitter feed.

26:51.140 --> 26:53.768
"Beautiful day
for a swim,"

26:53.770 --> 26:55.363
"thank you for all
your support.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.030
"My sister's doing ok.
I hope the police catch

26:57.040 --> 26:59.270
This creep before he
hurts someone else."

26:59.280 --> 27:00.543
She went wrong
with "creep."

27:00.550 --> 27:03.269
Impulsive tweeting. Robbie
thinks he's helping nina

27:03.280 --> 27:04.315
By attacking emily.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.049
He could interpret this
as rejection.

27:06.050 --> 27:09.213
It could trigger him
to go after her.

27:20.570 --> 27:23.232
Um, I think I'm gonna go
to the cafeteria.

27:23.240 --> 27:25.368
I need some coffee.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.002
[ding]

27:36.480 --> 27:40.417
Press is asking
for a statement.

27:40.420 --> 27:44.755
I'd really rather not.

27:50.160 --> 27:53.926
[door slides shut]

27:53.930 --> 27:56.968
Hey. I really need
to talk to you, nina.

27:56.970 --> 27:58.665
I'm sorry about what
happened with your sister,

27:58.670 --> 28:02.129
But she hurt you, and I
was just trying to protect you.

28:02.140 --> 28:03.608
Y-you need to
back off.

28:03.610 --> 28:04.634
You need to shut up!

28:04.650 --> 28:06.209
Just calm down.

28:06.210 --> 28:07.348
Shut up!

28:07.350 --> 28:08.272
Reed!

28:08.280 --> 28:09.441
You shut up!

28:09.450 --> 28:10.770
Don't you see?

28:10.790 --> 28:12.178
Those people are
no good for you.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.942
They don't love you
like I do.

28:13.950 --> 28:15.111
I just want to be
with you.

28:15.120 --> 28:17.282
I thought that's what
you wanted, too.

28:17.290 --> 28:18.951
Ok. Please leave.

28:18.960 --> 28:22.351
I'm paul.
You're my lily.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.397
I love you.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.090
[screaming]

28:31.300 --> 28:33.803
Aah! Get off me!

28:33.810 --> 28:35.335
Aah!

28:35.340 --> 28:36.978
Hey! Hey!

28:36.980 --> 28:38.470
Help!

28:41.720 --> 28:44.143
I just wanted to talk to her
to explain what happened.

28:44.150 --> 28:45.811
You mean about how
you tried to kill her sister?

28:45.820 --> 28:47.481
Mmm. No. I didn't
want to Kkill her.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.857
I just--I wanted to
hurt her,

28:49.860 --> 28:52.215
Hurt her enough so that
she would leave nina alone.

28:52.230 --> 28:53.925
You've been
watching them.

28:53.930 --> 28:56.490
Emily's so mean to nina.
It's...

28:56.500 --> 28:59.253
Obvious she resents her
because she's so talented.

28:59.270 --> 29:01.921
Nina doesn't heed someone
like that in her life.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.362
She needs you?

29:03.370 --> 29:04.235
I can protect her,

29:04.240 --> 29:06.106
But when I read
that tweet,

29:06.110 --> 29:07.339
I knew she didn't
understand.

29:07.340 --> 29:09.536
I had to make
her understand.

29:09.540 --> 29:14.046
You wrote to her,
and she never wrote back.

29:14.050 --> 29:15.245
No. She wrote to me
all the time.

29:15.250 --> 29:18.049
We had long talks
about everything,

29:18.050 --> 29:21.088
About our future, about
how we would be together.

29:21.090 --> 29:24.958
So in your opinion
you two were close?

29:24.960 --> 29:27.850
As close as two people
could be.

29:27.860 --> 29:29.282
I don't understand.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.120
My son has never
been violent.

29:31.130 --> 29:32.529
Someone must have
provoked him.

29:32.530 --> 29:34.726
Mrs. Dalton, I know
this is difficult to accept.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.868
Robbie is different.

29:36.870 --> 29:39.032
He's a dreamer.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.532
He gets a little moody
if he forgets his medication,

29:41.540 --> 29:43.872
But he's never
acted out like this.

29:43.880 --> 29:46.599
We found his antipsychotics
hidden in the shed.

29:46.610 --> 29:50.069
We believe he stopped
taking them a while ago.

29:50.080 --> 29:51.809
Still, that doesn't
necessarily--

29:51.820 --> 29:55.711
Robbie was positively
I.D.Ed by both victims.

29:55.720 --> 29:57.984
Your son suffers from
delusional disorder.

29:57.990 --> 30:01.449
At some point, he became
fixated on nina preston,

30:01.460 --> 30:06.159
And he created an elaborate
fantasy relationship with her.

30:06.170 --> 30:07.490
What's gonna
happen to him?

30:07.500 --> 30:09.730
He'll go to the detention
center for processing,

30:09.740 --> 30:12.300
And then he'll be housed
at the psychiatric ward

30:12.310 --> 30:14.608
For assessment
and treatment.

30:14.610 --> 30:16.237
And then they'll
let him go.

30:16.240 --> 30:19.073
Once his illness
is under control,

30:19.080 --> 30:22.448
He will be charged
for his crimes.

30:22.450 --> 30:24.578
He's going to prison?

30:24.590 --> 30:26.684
Eventually, yes.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.458
I just got off the phone
with nina.

30:32.460 --> 30:33.985
She's relieved that
we caught robbie,

30:33.990 --> 30:36.789
And she's decided to hire
private security moving forward.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.097
Glad to hear it.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.626
Guys, robbie was
telling the truth.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.098
I went through his
computer, and there's dozens

30:42.100 --> 30:43.295
Of e-mails between
him and nina preston.

30:43.300 --> 30:44.597
That's not possible.
Nina told me

30:44.610 --> 30:45.964
She doesn't
respond to fans.

30:45.970 --> 30:47.199
Then it's someone
posing as nina.

30:47.210 --> 30:49.030
Can you track
where they came from?

30:49.040 --> 30:53.341
The ip address leads to
public library, but listen to this.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.603
"Dear robbie, thank
you for your photo.

30:55.620 --> 30:57.110
"You're so handsome.
Ever thought

30:57.120 --> 31:00.613
Sounds like something
robbie would say about himself.

31:00.620 --> 31:01.883
Maybe he did.
He is delusional.

31:01.890 --> 31:04.279
Maybe we're confusing
hubris with pride.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.782
"You are one of a kind,
unique, special.

31:06.790 --> 31:09.157
"In my eyes,
you are perfect.

31:09.160 --> 31:10.650
"No matter what
anyone tells you,

31:10.660 --> 31:13.721
You deserve all the
happiness in the world."

31:13.730 --> 31:16.028
That's something a parent
says to a child.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.565
You think his mom
wrote e-mails

31:17.570 --> 31:18.640
Pretending
to be nina?

31:18.640 --> 31:20.005
I met her.
She was controlling.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.307
Which means robbie's
her world.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.971
Maybe she'd do
anything to protect him

31:22.980 --> 31:25.733
From being hurt,
even writing e-mails.

31:25.750 --> 31:28.071
What library did
it come from?

31:28.080 --> 31:30.640
El segundo. It's a mile
from robbie's house.

31:30.650 --> 31:32.311
Jack: Mom went
through his computer,

31:32.320 --> 31:33.310
Saw the e-mail
to nina,

31:33.320 --> 31:35.084
Didn't want him
to be disappointed,

31:35.090 --> 31:36.410
Decided to play
the part herself.

31:36.420 --> 31:38.718
Wouldn't have been hard
for her to set up a fake e-mail

31:38.730 --> 31:40.380
And pretend
to be nina.

31:40.390 --> 31:41.880
Only it backfired.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.026
She fed his delusion.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.657
Nancy dalton's got
a prior arrest

31:44.670 --> 31:46.320
For assault with
a deadly weapon.

31:46.330 --> 31:47.320
According to
the police report,

31:47.330 --> 31:49.492
She threatened one
of robbie's schoolmates

31:49.500 --> 31:52.333
She pled out and got
counseling and probation.

31:52.340 --> 31:55.264
She said the kid was
bullying and hurting her son,

31:55.280 --> 31:57.203
And he needed
to be punished.

31:57.210 --> 31:58.177
Where is nina preston?

31:58.180 --> 31:59.272
She's shooting today.

31:59.280 --> 32:00.099
Get a hold of her.

32:00.110 --> 32:01.669
Man: Ok, folks.
That's a wrap.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.614
All right.
Good night, everybody.

32:03.620 --> 32:06.339
Good night, nina!
Good night!

32:06.350 --> 32:08.682
Randy, I'll be out
in @ minute.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.351
Very well.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.354
Her cell's going
to voicemail.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.055
Call studio security,
have them alert

32:17.060 --> 32:18.130
Her private detail.

32:18.130 --> 32:19.859
I'm actually on the
pone with them right now.

32:19.870 --> 32:21.690
They're saying nancy
dalton signed up

32:21.700 --> 32:23.236
For studio tour
earlier today.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.436
She could still
be on the lot.

32:25.940 --> 32:28.102
[cell phone vibrates]

32:31.040 --> 32:33.372
Yeah?

32:34.250 --> 32:37.550
Roger that.
I'll keep an eye out.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.224
Unh!

32:51.230 --> 32:53.221
[slice]

33:14.820 --> 33:16.754
May I help you?

33:16.760 --> 33:18.785
I'm here for wardrobe.

33:18.790 --> 33:20.758
What happened
to suzie?

33:20.760 --> 33:25.254
Oh, she went home sick
after lunch.

33:25.270 --> 33:27.591
I'm nancy.
I'm filling in.

33:27.600 --> 33:31.298
Oh. Well, take whatever
you need, nancy.

33:31.310 --> 33:35.201
All the dresses are
hanging in the back.

33:45.620 --> 33:48.282
You're very pretty.

33:48.290 --> 33:50.281
Thank you.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.985
Not as pretty
as on the show

33:51.990 --> 33:56.279
But pretty enough.

33:56.300 --> 33:59.725
I get why my boy
fell for you.

33:59.730 --> 34:03.837
It's my fault. I never should
have written those letters.

34:03.840 --> 34:07.162
Um, I'm sorry.
What letters?

34:07.170 --> 34:09.810
I didn't know.
I didn't know the lengths

34:09.810 --> 34:14.407
Robbie would go to
to be with you.

34:14.420 --> 34:17.811
What is it that
you want?

34:17.820 --> 34:20.516
You hurt my little boy.

34:20.520 --> 34:24.753
He'll be better off
with you gone.

34:24.760 --> 34:28.060
Aah! Aah!

34:28.060 --> 34:29.425
Aah!

34:29.429 --> 34:30.659
Ugh!

34:30.659 --> 34:32.628
Randy?

34:33.170 --> 34:34.422
Randy?

34:34.440 --> 34:36.397
Aah!

34:40.870 --> 34:42.735
[siren]

34:44.739 --> 34:45.730
Where's nina's trailer?

34:45.750 --> 34:48.400
Last row. You got
to go around.

34:50.850 --> 34:52.579
Ohh!

35:07.430 --> 35:09.467
[gasps]

35:58.920 --> 36:01.719
Empty.
This way.

36:10.130 --> 36:11.450
He's still alive.

36:11.470 --> 36:14.360
Call an ambulance.
Stay with him.

36:40.890 --> 36:44.394
[door opens and shuts]

36:54.470 --> 36:57.633
Aah! Aah!

37:02.150 --> 37:04.812
Aah! Ohh!

37:13.390 --> 37:14.528
Aah!

37:14.530 --> 37:16.487
Aah!

37:19.270 --> 37:20.169
Come on.

37:20.170 --> 37:24.334
He's--he's my only son.
He's special.

37:24.340 --> 37:25.159
I know.

37:25.170 --> 37:26.569
He needs special help.

37:26.570 --> 37:30.404
He'll get it.
So will you.

37:32.410 --> 37:34.742
Come on.

37:34.750 --> 37:37.970
[music playing]

38:45.350 --> 38:46.909
Taking off?
Yeah.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.412
I'll walk out
with you.

38:49.420 --> 38:53.630
Hey. Uh, listen. You've
worked with beth for a long time.

38:53.630 --> 38:54.927
What do you know
about her?

38:54.930 --> 38:56.250
You're not gonna
get her in bed,

38:56.260 --> 38:57.625
If that's what
you're wondering.

38:57.630 --> 38:58.927
No. I didn't
mean that.

38:58.930 --> 39:00.591
What's her backstory?

39:00.600 --> 39:02.967
Honestly,
I don't know.

39:02.970 --> 39:03.835
You don't know?

39:03.840 --> 39:05.934
I googled her
when I got this job.

39:05.940 --> 39:07.430
You googled her?

39:07.440 --> 39:09.534
I googled you.

39:09.540 --> 39:10.974
But when I did a search
on beth davis,

39:10.980 --> 39:13.506
There was nothing
outside the lapd.

39:13.510 --> 39:16.639
Like what?
She doesn't exist?

39:16.650 --> 39:19.540
She's a private woman,
secretive,

39:19.550 --> 39:22.542
Doesn't use
social media.

39:22.560 --> 39:24.119
You're a good detective.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.124
Think about it.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.019
Something bad
happened to her.

39:29.030 --> 39:34.525
She's a walking textbook for someone
who's lived through a major trauma.

39:35.330 --> 39:39.460
Do you really need
to know the specifics?

39:39.470 --> 39:41.461
Guess not.

39:48.050 --> 39:52.044
Ok. You're certain
he didn't send it?

39:58.560 --> 40:02.258
Ok. Thank you
for checking.

40:19.010 --> 40:22.275
[music continues]

40:31.790 --> 40:32.860
You think ray
sent it?

40:32.860 --> 40:35.852
It's exactly the kind
of thing he would do.

40:35.860 --> 40:39.353
But the hospital said
it wasn't him.

40:39.370 --> 40:43.364
What if he found me?

40:43.370 --> 40:45.759
Do you remember
what you told me

40:45.770 --> 40:51.300
You said he can't hurt
me again unless I let him.

40:51.310 --> 40:53.039
I know.

40:53.710 --> 40:57.874
I feel like I'm
losing my mind.

40:59.550 --> 41:02.588
This case I was on

41:02.590 --> 41:05.457
Got me thinking
about my sister

41:05.460 --> 41:09.124
And how I haven't
thought about her

41:09.130 --> 41:12.498
Or what happened

41:12.500 --> 41:15.663
In a really long time...

41:17.940 --> 41:22.468
And I liked that
I hadn't thought about it.

41:22.480 --> 41:26.178
It was a relief somehow. Does
that make me a terrible person?

41:26.180 --> 41:28.979
It makes you human.

41:30.250 --> 41:31.513
[cell phone rings]

41:31.520 --> 41:32.316
Oh. Sorry.

41:32.320 --> 41:33.617
We can finish this
another time.

41:33.620 --> 41:38.410
Stay. I'll reschedule.
Brody will understand.

41:38.430 --> 41:39.181
Hello?

41:39.190 --> 41:40.589
Hey. What are
you wearing?

41:40.590 --> 41:42.319
Picturing something
black and sexy.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.094
Tell me you haven't
left yet.

41:44.100 --> 41:46.865
I just walked
out the door.

41:46.870 --> 41:47.928
You're not coming.

41:47.930 --> 41:52.595
It's a friend thing.
I--beth needs me tonight.

41:52.610 --> 41:55.762
Yeah. Totally get it.
Is she ok?

41:55.780 --> 41:58.169
Yeah. Yeah. T'll
explain it later.

41:58.180 --> 42:00.376
I promise T'll
make it up to you.

42:00.380 --> 42:02.144
I'll hold you
do that.

42:02.150 --> 42:05.609
