00:39.706 --> 00:40.874
(rattles)

00:49.758 --> 00:51.760
(dramatic music continues playing)

01:09.152 --> 01:11.738
CHRISTINE: They'll need medical
and welfare clearance

01:11.822 --> 01:12.656
before they're discharged.

01:13.699 --> 01:17.619
How are they gonna survive out there,
in the real world?

01:18.829 --> 01:22.833
Most of them were born to teenage mothers
and then adopted at birth by Adrienne.

01:23.917 --> 01:27.296
No court on earth
will give her continued custody

01:27.379 --> 01:29.381
after what she's done to these kids.

01:32.551 --> 01:34.886
And... you know what the saddest thing is?

01:36.680 --> 01:38.473
CHRISTINE: They keep asking
for their mommy.

01:42.060 --> 01:44.229
(theme music playing)

02:13.175 --> 02:15.385
(gentle music playing)

02:15.469 --> 02:17.471
(birds chirping)

02:31.318 --> 02:32.736
(breathes deeply)

02:42.496 --> 02:44.831
REPORTER: ...tonight as hundreds
of flights are suspended,

02:44.915 --> 02:46.792
following the ash cloud from an eruption

02:46.875 --> 02:50.504
in the Puyehue-Cordón Caulle
volcano complex in Chile.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.423
COLIN: Interpol confirmed
an Adrienne Beaufort

02:53.507 --> 02:56.677
cleared customs in Paris on the 6th,
but they lost track of her after that.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.304
Was she traveling alone?

02:59.388 --> 03:00.806
Single first-class ticket.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.974
For fuck's sake.

03:07.270 --> 03:08.939
How could they let her leave the country?

03:09.606 --> 03:12.818
There was no alert on her passport
and she flew out before the raid.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.111
So she was tipped off?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.780
(ominous music playing)

03:23.245 --> 03:25.956
MR. SQUIGGLE: It's splashed spaghetti
that has just escaped from the tin.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.207
That's the tin.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.000
-HOST: An escapee spaghetti.
-MR. SQUIGGLE: It's the tin...

03:29.084 --> 03:30.043
HOST: It's escaped from the tin.

03:30.127 --> 03:31.378
MR. SQUIGGLE: That's the tin of spaghetti.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.880
-HOST: Mm-mm. What on earth...
-MR. SQUIGGLE: You don't like that?

03:33.964 --> 03:35.215
-HOST: It's interesting.
-MR. SQUIGGLE: I...

03:35.298 --> 03:37.217
I see, you don't like it. How's that?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.219
(TV chatter)

03:41.096 --> 03:43.306
(key clanking)

03:44.641 --> 03:45.726
(TV chatter continues)

03:47.185 --> 03:50.689
-You told the Blue Devils where we were.
-I didn't.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.857
You've destroyed everything.

03:51.940 --> 03:54.568
-Where's Mommy?
-The Blue Devils are looking for her.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.528
And you know what they'll do
when they find her, don't you, Amy?

03:56.611 --> 03:58.989
-You know exactly what they're gonna do.
-JOE: Anton.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.533
Amy, how are you feeling?

04:02.451 --> 04:03.452
Good.

04:03.535 --> 04:04.953
Have you found Mommy?

04:06.872 --> 04:09.583
I promise you we're doing everything
in our power to find her.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.005
Do either of you recognize
this little girl?

04:17.799 --> 04:18.800
No.

04:23.054 --> 04:26.266
Amy, is this Asha?

04:29.895 --> 04:30.812
I don't know.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.024
This little girl was kidnapped

04:34.983 --> 04:36.401
and she never made it home.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.652
Asha never made it home?

04:37.736 --> 04:39.571
(suspenseful music playing)

04:46.119 --> 04:49.790
Amy, you wrote in your diary
that Henrik took Asha home

04:49.873 --> 04:51.833
a few days after he kidnapped her.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.424
We're gonna need you to make a statement

04:59.508 --> 05:02.385
telling us everything you know
about what happened to Asha.

05:03.261 --> 05:04.221
Is that okay?

05:04.846 --> 05:05.972
And then you'll find her?

05:06.848 --> 05:07.933
And then I'll find her.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.104
(TV chatter)

05:14.064 --> 05:15.899
REPORTER: The search for missing
Woodfield girl,

05:15.982 --> 05:18.401
Carrie Anderson, continues.

05:18.485 --> 05:21.822
Police have revealed an eyewitness
saw a man talking to Carrie

05:21.905 --> 05:25.075
near the Pike Road turn-off shortly
before she disappeared.

05:25.617 --> 05:29.329
It's believed the man is not a local and
is described as in his mid-to-late 30s.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.288
GUARD: Freya Heywood?

05:30.372 --> 05:31.790
(kid chatters)

05:31.873 --> 05:34.251
REPORTER: It is believed the man
was caught on CCTV footage...

05:34.334 --> 05:35.877
-GUARD: Just need you to sign here.
-...that same day

05:35.961 --> 05:37.879
-at a bottle shop in Woodfield.
-GUARD: And...

05:37.963 --> 05:41.299
REPORTER: Police are asking anyone
who may have seen him to come forward.

05:41.383 --> 05:45.178
-I'll get you to go over there.
-Now it's time for sports with Ian Cohen.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.642
(door opens)

05:56.231 --> 05:57.357
(door closes)

05:57.440 --> 05:59.442
(indistinct chatter)

06:14.416 --> 06:16.585
-Sister Amy.
-Freya.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.174
I've waited a long time for you to come.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.594
I don't owe you anything.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.682
Not even an explanation?

06:30.765 --> 06:31.808
You know why.

06:32.434 --> 06:33.268
HENRIK: Yes.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.895
To protect Adrienne.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.441
And that's all we've ever done, isn't it?

06:42.110 --> 06:43.778
Have you spoken to her recently?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.073
She calls me. Yes.

06:48.199 --> 06:49.284
What do you talk about?

06:55.081 --> 06:56.833
"It'll be all right, Henrik.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.460
A couple of years,

06:59.502 --> 07:00.587
maximum,

07:02.380 --> 07:04.716
and my lawyers, they will look after you."

07:06.343 --> 07:08.553
(laughs)

07:10.639 --> 07:12.390
Twenty-two years

07:13.600 --> 07:17.979
and not one visit from any of them.

07:18.396 --> 07:20.941
And then all of a sudden, a call a day.

07:21.858 --> 07:24.194
They're paying you to stick to your story,
aren't they?

07:26.821 --> 07:28.448
Bryce has been selling off properties.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.284
I'm losing my house because of you.

07:31.952 --> 07:36.039
You have a problem
with me taking their hush money.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.334
Or perhaps you would like me
to tell the police

07:39.417 --> 07:44.297
that your statement, your diaries,
they're all a pack of lies?

07:50.804 --> 07:51.846
I was a child.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.975
(suspenseful music playing)

07:57.435 --> 07:58.770
Thank you for coming, Amy.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.108
What happened to Asha?

08:03.191 --> 08:04.943
SECURITY: Remain seated, please.

08:08.989 --> 08:13.034
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answer to.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.995
You were the last person to see her.

08:15.203 --> 08:16.913
You accuse me again?

08:17.539 --> 08:19.082
Is that why you're here?

08:20.250 --> 08:21.376
I just want the truth.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.752
(soft laugh)

08:24.838 --> 08:26.131
What would you know about that?

08:29.259 --> 08:30.093
Did you kill her?

08:30.176 --> 08:32.721
-I said leave it alone, Amy!
-SECURITY: That's too loud.

08:33.013 --> 08:33.930
Take note!

08:34.889 --> 08:36.975
I wouldn't make a deal with the devil.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.476
(Henrik grunts)

08:41.062 --> 08:41.896
(door closes)

08:47.861 --> 08:49.237
HANNAH: Never seen her before.

08:52.115 --> 08:55.660
One of the children has confirmed
that Sara McFetridge

08:55.744 --> 08:58.288
is the child you refer to as Asha.

08:59.622 --> 09:00.623
No.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.460
Asha is Adrienne's daughter.

09:05.003 --> 09:07.255
Well, how old's Adrienne?
Fifty-four? Fifty-five?

09:07.338 --> 09:09.007
Adopted daughter.

09:10.258 --> 09:11.718
There are no records of an adoption.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.512
You'll have to talk to Tamsin.
She's the one who organized it.

09:14.971 --> 09:15.972
And where's Tamsin?

09:20.351 --> 09:23.980
(laughs)

09:26.941 --> 09:27.942
I don't know.

09:28.818 --> 09:31.112
Did you witness any abuse at Blackmarsh?

09:31.946 --> 09:34.699
Absolutely not, Detective Garrison.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.787
And how do you explain that the children
have the emotional capacity

09:38.870 --> 09:40.038
of two-year-olds?

09:40.455 --> 09:42.624
That most of them have PTSD?

09:42.707 --> 09:44.459
That all of them
are severely malnourished?

09:44.542 --> 09:49.672
When earthly appetites are subdued,
internal strength is fortified.

09:49.756 --> 09:51.800
(light music playing)

09:55.470 --> 10:01.768
Well, can you confirm that this
is your ex-wife Tamsin Latham's signature?

10:01.851 --> 10:02.977
Yes, I can.

10:03.228 --> 10:05.980
Tamsin Latham was the midwife
at St. Aloysius,

10:06.272 --> 10:08.733
the same hospital where the babies
were taken from at birth.

10:08.817 --> 10:10.110
They weren't taken.

10:10.360 --> 10:12.695
They were foundlings, unwanted children.

10:12.779 --> 10:13.988
They were being given a good home.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.698
Is that what you call it?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.036
And what about Sara McFetridge,
Mr. Latham?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.330
Was she being given a good home?

10:26.960 --> 10:28.419
(exhales deeply)

10:29.003 --> 10:30.380
It's Doctor, actually.

10:30.797 --> 10:31.714
Doctor Latham.

10:32.590 --> 10:36.302
We know you drove the van
that abducted Sara McFetridge.

10:37.303 --> 10:41.015
And we have a witness
that said you took her home.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.352
But Sara never made it home,

10:45.311 --> 10:46.646
did she, Mr. Wilczek?

10:49.941 --> 10:52.318
You abducted Sara for Adrienne,
didn't you?

10:55.155 --> 10:58.575
And do you know where Adrienne is
while you're sitting here, taking the rap?

10:59.784 --> 11:01.953
Living it up in gay Paris.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.208
She's got no loyalty to anyone
but herself.

11:11.504 --> 11:13.882
JOE: Even from bloody France,
she's got them in her thrall.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.717
Brainwashed children, I get,

11:15.800 --> 11:18.178
but how any adult can fall
for her bullshit is beyond me.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.848
We've got nothing to prove Asha
was Sara McFetridge.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.308
You heard Amy.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.602
She as good as admitted it.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.524
What happened to those kids out there...

11:33.610 --> 11:34.611
it's giving me nightmares.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.070
Imagine what it's doing to them.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.739
(screeching)

11:39.532 --> 11:41.534
We need to track down Tamsin Latham.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.413
Bank cards, car rego.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.333
She can't have just disappeared
into thin air.

11:49.584 --> 11:51.294
We offer her a deal, maybe she'll talk.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.973
ADRIENNE: And on you is this curse
until the day of recompense.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
(ominous music playing)

12:15.693 --> 12:18.196
(birds chirping)

12:23.618 --> 12:24.702
Billy, move.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.545
Billy, take the ball outside.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.257
MAX: Hey, you've reached Max.
Might listen. Probs won't.

12:39.467 --> 12:43.054
Hey, Max, it's... Freya.

12:43.930 --> 12:45.056
Um...

12:46.808 --> 12:48.268
I'd love to see you again.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.771
I was thinking maybe we could...

12:54.607 --> 12:57.777
-go get lunch, or...
-(glass shatters)

12:58.361 --> 12:59.988
I told you outside with that.

13:00.071 --> 13:01.155
But it's too cold.

13:01.239 --> 13:02.865
Well, then put a jacket on!

13:03.533 --> 13:04.867
(sighs deeply)

13:06.160 --> 13:07.412
So... sorry about that.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.123
Um, yeah, just, just let me know.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.958
Okay. (sighs)

13:12.041 --> 13:14.210
(dog barking in distance)

13:17.338 --> 13:19.549
(foreboding music playing)

13:24.262 --> 13:26.097
(knocking)

13:29.100 --> 13:30.310
Hey, Aims.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.395
(dog barking continues)

13:39.944 --> 13:40.903
Does he bite?

13:40.987 --> 13:42.155
That depends.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.406
On what?

13:43.698 --> 13:44.949
Only if I tell him to.

13:45.033 --> 13:46.659
So tell him I'm family.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.204
Sit, Leo.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.999
What are you doing here?

13:54.125 --> 13:55.585
Oh, nice to see you too.

14:03.634 --> 14:04.635
Thank you.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.265
(door creaks close)

14:11.768 --> 14:12.727
Nice pad.

14:13.478 --> 14:14.395
Thanks.

14:16.898 --> 14:18.483
And who is this cool dude?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.236
He's my son. Billy.

14:22.820 --> 14:23.696
Hey, Billy.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.281
Up high.
(grunts)

14:25.365 --> 14:27.742
Down low. Oh, you got me.

14:27.825 --> 14:28.826
(both laugh)

14:28.910 --> 14:31.496
Hey, so, come on,
how do we play this game?

14:31.579 --> 14:35.083
You can only let the ball touch the ground
once before catching it.

14:35.458 --> 14:36.876
-Go.
-(grunts)

14:37.543 --> 14:38.461
That was close.

14:38.836 --> 14:39.962
(Anton grunts)

14:40.046 --> 14:41.339
No balls inside.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.715
Hey. Hey, mate?

14:42.799 --> 14:44.425
Yeah? Better do what your mom says.

14:44.509 --> 14:46.177
-Um-hm.
-Um-hm.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.221
You're it.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.139
-(Anton grunting)
-(Billy laughs)

14:50.223 --> 14:51.474
ANTON: I'm coming for you.

14:52.892 --> 14:55.186
(Billy chuckles)

14:55.269 --> 14:56.604
ANTON: Got you, got you, got you.

14:57.188 --> 14:59.190
(Leo barking)

15:06.989 --> 15:08.032
When did you get back?

15:08.950 --> 15:10.868
(exhales deeply)
A few months ago.

15:12.036 --> 15:14.789
Hung out in Byron for a bit
and then drove down.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.958
So you're back for good or...

15:17.041 --> 15:18.668
Uh... we'll see.

15:23.172 --> 15:25.466
I thought you were living in Thailand
permanently.

15:26.592 --> 15:27.510
Yeah, well...

15:28.761 --> 15:29.887
opportunities dried up.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.432
Where's Thailand, Uncle Anton?

15:38.229 --> 15:40.523
-What?
-He should know we're related.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.151
Do you like coconuts?

15:43.651 --> 15:47.280
You know, in Thailand, instead of toast
for breakfast, you drink a coconut.

15:48.990 --> 15:49.991
Yeah.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.617
Check this out.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.872
Look, they just drop into your lap.
Can you believe it?

15:57.582 --> 15:58.791
ANTON: Oops.
(laughs)

15:58.875 --> 16:01.377
All right, Bilbo. Bath and bed. Come on.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.893
Oh, yes.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.646
(phone chimes)

16:39.290 --> 16:42.835
So little Abi's getting married.

16:44.879 --> 16:46.547
It's nice of her to invite me.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.387
So how's Mom?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.725
-You haven't seen her yet?
-Not yet.

16:58.100 --> 16:59.185
Right.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.396
Yeah, well, she keeps breaking out
during the day.

17:03.022 --> 17:05.900
The agency are pushing for 24-hour shifts,
which will never work.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.903
Well, it can't be easy pretending
you've lost your marbles all day.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.655
Yeah, she's a good actress.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.491
And she knows the alternative.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.248
Thanks for looking after everything, Aims.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.166
You know, checking in with Mom.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.628
None of the others would have done it.

17:27.672 --> 17:28.673
Hey, uh...

17:30.216 --> 17:31.634
I got us a little something.

17:35.012 --> 17:36.097
Old time's sake?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.723
You're not doing that in my house.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.350
You mean Mommy's house?

17:42.061 --> 17:44.272
I mean, I understand
why she gave it to you.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.941
Wasn't like you could look after yourself.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.234
(laughs)

17:49.777 --> 17:52.446
Mind you, I never got a cent.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.658
And I was the only one
who supported her during the trial.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.244
(ominous music playing)

18:01.664 --> 18:03.416
(gulps)

18:08.004 --> 18:11.382
-BILLY: Uncle Anton, wake up.
-ANTON: Hey, go away.

18:11.591 --> 18:12.466
Get up!

18:12.550 --> 18:13.884
We're leaving for the day.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.386
Can Uncle Anton stay?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.264
Hey. Uncle Anton would love that.

18:18.347 --> 18:21.684
BOTH: Yay, yay, yay, yay, yay!

18:24.437 --> 18:26.355
Uncle Anton's getting in his car.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.940
But I want him to stay.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.400
Please.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.569
-Yeah. Come on, Mom. I wanna stay.
-Please.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.905
I want him to stay.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.326
Please.

18:38.409 --> 18:39.827
We're going. Get in the car.

18:39.952 --> 18:40.953
(Billy grunts)

18:46.250 --> 18:48.044
BILLY: I see Harry. Can I get out now?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.503
FREYA: Just wait till I pull over.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.509
(Harry laughs)

18:56.010 --> 18:58.095
BILLY: Mom, did you pack my library bag?

18:58.179 --> 19:00.848
-HARRY'S DAD: Have a great day, yeah?
-HARRY: Love you, Dad.

19:01.515 --> 19:02.683
BILLY: I can't see it.

19:06.103 --> 19:07.355
Billy?

19:08.314 --> 19:09.315
Yeah, Mom?

19:10.274 --> 19:12.818
You know that man
that came to pick up Max?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.403
Yeah.

19:14.820 --> 19:18.115
His name is Wayne, and he's Max's dad.

19:18.199 --> 19:19.367
Yeah, I know that.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.829
And...

19:24.955 --> 19:26.457
he's your dad.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.419
But how come I've never seen him before?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.380
Well, he lives in Adelaide, so...

19:33.214 --> 19:34.840
Will he live with us now?

19:35.508 --> 19:36.550
No, he won't.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.678
But...

19:39.637 --> 19:41.389
you could spend some time with him.

19:42.223 --> 19:44.058
-Would you like that?
-No.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.020
-Why not?
-I don't know.

19:48.896 --> 19:53.234
Okay. Well, I think he would probably
really like to spend some time with you.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.904
-Will you be there?
-Yeah, I'll be there.

19:57.697 --> 20:00.366
-Okay. Can I get out now?
-Yeah.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.119
(car door opens)

20:06.622 --> 20:08.082
-BILLY: Hey, Harry.
-(car door closes)

20:08.165 --> 20:11.669
-Hi. Billy, wanna play basketball?
-BILLY: Yeah, sure.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.170
HARRY: Let's go to the bottom court.

20:13.254 --> 20:14.380
BILLY: Okay.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.846
(light music playing)

20:37.319 --> 20:42.700
CHRISTINE: Okay, the first step
is to reunite you with your birth families

20:43.617 --> 20:45.286
as soon as we can locate them.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.248
I know this is difficult,

20:49.749 --> 20:52.918
but I'm gonna be there with you
every step of the way.

20:53.461 --> 20:56.422
You're not going anywhere
until you're completely comfortable.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.968
You're going home to families
who love you.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.929
Nobody's gonna hurt you anymore.

21:04.764 --> 21:08.601
And I promise you
that I'll bring to justice those who did.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.564
(light music playing)

21:33.751 --> 21:34.794
Hi.

21:36.837 --> 21:38.047
My name is Susan.

21:39.256 --> 21:41.008
And I'm your mom.
(soft laugh)

21:43.719 --> 21:44.887
Come here.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.640
(Susan sighs)

21:50.810 --> 21:52.812
(dramatic music playing)

22:05.407 --> 22:06.617
(exhales deeply)

22:19.964 --> 22:21.173
Slowly.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.217
Slowly.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.558
Hey, little man.

22:31.433 --> 22:32.351
Hi.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.689
I thought we could have a kick.

22:36.772 --> 22:37.648
What do you reckon?

22:38.482 --> 22:40.359
-Yeah.
-Okay.

22:40.943 --> 22:41.986
Let's go.

22:43.779 --> 22:45.865
Reckon you can make it over this?
(grunts)

22:49.201 --> 22:50.870
(Wayne laughs)

22:50.953 --> 22:53.455
WAYNE: Oh, it's gonna be hard
to keep up with you.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.832
(Billy chuckles)

22:54.915 --> 22:56.333
WAYNE: Ho-hoho.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.502
-Oh, good kick.
-(Billy laughs)

22:58.586 --> 22:59.503
WAYNE: Nice legwork, mate.

22:59.587 --> 23:00.754
BILLY: You can't get it.

23:00.838 --> 23:03.966
We haven't managed to locate
either of your birth parents yet.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.010
That's because Adrienne is our mother.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.597
-Well, that may be the case...
-It is the case.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.724
Okay.

23:12.766 --> 23:16.478
Adrienne's lawyers
have contacted Social Services.

23:16.645 --> 23:21.650
Even if you are her biological children,
she's forfeiting any claims to custody.

23:22.693 --> 23:23.652
What does that mean?

23:24.653 --> 23:27.448
It means you...
you become wards of the state,

23:27.823 --> 23:30.409
until we can either
locate your birth parents,

23:30.492 --> 23:32.870
or allocate you to foster parents.

23:33.495 --> 23:34.330
You're lying.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.998
She would never do that. You're lying.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.545
-And you, you did this.
-Anton.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.088
You made Mommy leave us!

23:43.672 --> 23:44.715
ANTON: You made her leave us!

23:46.884 --> 23:48.427
No, no. Put that down, Anton.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.637
CHRISTINE: No!

23:50.346 --> 23:51.931
JOE: Just calm down. Calm down.

23:52.014 --> 23:53.891
-Settle down.
-CHRISTINE: Joe. Joe.

23:53.974 --> 23:55.142
-ANTON: You get off me! You devil!
-JOE: It's okay.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.019
It's okay, mate.

23:57.102 --> 23:58.520
-ANTON: Oh, get off me!
-JOE: It's okay.

23:58.604 --> 23:59.688
-Get off me, get off me.
-It's okay.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.441
(Anton grunts, pants)

24:02.524 --> 24:03.525
It's okay, mate.

24:04.735 --> 24:05.861
It's okay.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.447
ANTON: Mommy. I want my mommy.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.870
ADRIENNE: Turn away from the darkness.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.624
It may gather force
but the light will win.

24:20.084 --> 24:22.962
You have great adventures open before you

24:23.671 --> 24:28.008
and you must walk on,
knowing your Maitreya is with you,

24:28.592 --> 24:30.010
if only in spirit.

24:30.678 --> 24:31.553
COLETTE (in French): Madam?

24:31.637 --> 24:32.972
A call for you.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.358
(in English) The police say they have
proof that I kidnapped Sara McFetridge.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.611
How is that possible?
You had nothing to do with it.

24:47.695 --> 24:49.530
HENRIK: I know. They're bluffing.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.993
Tamsin's gone to ground
and they're looking for a scalp.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.619
Have they spoken to Hannah?

24:56.036 --> 24:57.204
HENRIK: She's holding fast.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.332
What if they find out the truth?

25:01.834 --> 25:03.627
ADRIENNE: Do you trust me, Henrik?

25:05.671 --> 25:06.797
Of course, Maitreya.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.882
Then listen to me very carefully

25:08.966 --> 25:11.468
and I'll tell you exactly
what you must do.

25:11.969 --> 25:14.054
(crickets creak)

25:20.477 --> 25:21.687
(brakes screech)

25:28.360 --> 25:30.446
BRYCE: Colin, I need a word.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.992
I don't want anything more to do with you.

25:35.617 --> 25:36.577
Or her.

25:36.660 --> 25:40.205
Well, that might be a problem because
Detective Saad is refusing to let this go.

25:41.415 --> 25:42.958
Did you take that little girl?

25:43.208 --> 25:46.336
Of course not.
Saad is just trying to discredit us.

25:46.837 --> 25:48.380
If I'd known what you were doing,

25:49.381 --> 25:51.508
what was happening to those children,
I would have...

25:53.093 --> 25:54.219
-I would have never...
-What?

25:54.470 --> 25:56.346
Shared your most intimate confessions?

25:57.598 --> 25:59.391
I'm sure your wife and Superintendent

25:59.475 --> 26:02.102
would be very keen to see
the recordings of your clearings.

26:03.937 --> 26:06.523
Colin, we need your eyes in there.

26:06.607 --> 26:08.525
These people are trying
to bring down Maitreya

26:08.609 --> 26:10.319
and destroy everything we've worked for.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.945
And you can stop that.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.740
(ominous music playing)

26:22.664 --> 26:25.417
(door creaks close)

26:35.511 --> 26:37.179
Hey, Max.

26:37.763 --> 26:38.597
Hey.

26:38.680 --> 26:40.265
Good to finally meet you.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.144
Jump in.

26:47.773 --> 26:50.275
ANTON: Jesus, you are my niece.

26:50.359 --> 26:54.279
That just... blows my mind.

26:54.363 --> 26:56.156
(both laugh)

26:58.200 --> 27:00.702
You know what I realized
having been away for so long?

27:01.787 --> 27:04.039
-What?
-Family's fucking everything.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.126
Especially moms, yeah?

27:07.209 --> 27:08.919
I mean, you only get one, right?

27:10.587 --> 27:13.632
Yeah, well, my dad lied about mine.

27:14.675 --> 27:15.634
Yep.

27:16.844 --> 27:17.803
So...

27:18.804 --> 27:23.392
I found her name on my birth certificate
and Googled it.

27:25.644 --> 27:27.521
I read about The Kindred.

27:28.564 --> 27:32.109
What happened to you, all those
terrible things that Grandma did.

27:32.192 --> 27:34.361
No, come on, Max, it was all lies.

27:34.945 --> 27:38.323
Your, your grandma
is a spiritual leader, okay?

27:39.074 --> 27:42.494
Healing people,
helping them all over the world.

27:42.578 --> 27:45.873
Yeah, come on.
Of course, she's, she's got enemies,

27:45.956 --> 27:46.999
like all great people.

27:47.082 --> 27:48.375
Yeah, no, no, I know.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.627
She, she helped me.

27:51.545 --> 27:52.671
Told me where to find Mom.

27:54.923 --> 27:56.425
Hey, you know what I like about you, Max?

27:57.676 --> 28:01.722
How you can see through all the bullshit
and make up your own mind.

28:02.514 --> 28:03.640
Like with your mom.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.685
A lot of people judge her pretty harshly,

28:07.644 --> 28:09.938
but you can forgive her.

28:12.024 --> 28:15.527
Truth is, leaving you in that hot car,
you could have died,

28:15.611 --> 28:17.613
or worse still,
been brain damaged for life.

28:18.071 --> 28:19.114
Yeah.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.910
But we all deserve a second chance, right?

28:24.453 --> 28:26.455
(dramatic music playing)

28:29.541 --> 28:30.792
(sighs)

28:42.638 --> 28:45.057
(dramatic music continues playing)

29:02.532 --> 29:03.867
(sighs deeply)

29:06.036 --> 29:07.537
-WAITRESS: Here's your menu.
-Thank you.

29:20.425 --> 29:21.760
(clanks)

29:27.599 --> 29:30.477
MAX: Hey, this is Max. Might listen.
Probs won't.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.395
(cell phone beeps)

29:31.478 --> 29:32.646
(sighs)

29:33.480 --> 29:36.024
(breathes deeply)

29:44.700 --> 29:46.952
(birds chirping)

29:47.035 --> 29:49.162
ADRIENNE: Give her time.
She'll come round.

29:49.830 --> 29:51.498
I don't know, maybe it's too late.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.626
Maybe Max doesn't wanna be part
of my life.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.211
Where are the Christmas presents?

29:57.254 --> 29:58.297
(laughs)

29:58.380 --> 30:01.758
-Mom, it's not, it's not Christmas yet.
-We need to wrap the presents.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.011
We will do that, Mrs. Beaufort.

30:04.845 --> 30:06.763
I've already done two loads today.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.600
I don't think my Weetbix-to-milk ratio
agreed with Madam.

30:11.351 --> 30:13.145
Why don't you just try Vegemite on toast?

30:13.228 --> 30:14.813
Oh, then that would make me sick.

30:15.772 --> 30:17.899
Careful, Mo.
They could deport you for saying that.

30:19.026 --> 30:20.360
FREYA: You're staying here.

30:20.652 --> 30:21.570
What?

30:22.904 --> 30:24.573
It's a big house. Plenty of bedrooms.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.950
And it means someone can be
here overnight. Right, Mo?

30:27.534 --> 30:28.827
It is a good idea.

30:33.790 --> 30:35.792
You won't have to worry
about driving in so much, Aims.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.336
I know it's a long way for you to come.

30:38.920 --> 30:42.549
Mind you, I did hear you might be looking
for a new place to live soon.

30:45.093 --> 30:49.973
Hey, after my shower, how about I go
get us some takeaway coffees, yeah?

30:51.600 --> 30:52.684
Would you like that, Mommy?

30:54.686 --> 30:58.023
Yes, darling, yes.
Amy can put up the tree.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.525
Oh, yeah. Get onto that, Aims, would you?

31:02.486 --> 31:07.115
I was wondering, do you have a photo album
I could show Mrs. Beaufort?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.785
It is a great way to uncover memories.

31:09.868 --> 31:11.870
(ominous music playing)

31:19.795 --> 31:21.922
REPORTER:
...at a bottle shop in Woodfield.

31:22.047 --> 31:25.592
Police are asking anyone
who may have seen him to come forward.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.477
ANTON: Amy, get in!

31:37.604 --> 31:38.730
(van door rattles)

31:50.325 --> 31:51.410
SARA: Help!

31:51.493 --> 31:52.869
Down here!

31:52.953 --> 31:54.830
ANTON: Be quiet,
or you'll never make another sound.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.291
(breathes deeply)

32:03.255 --> 32:04.714
FREYA: He had a beard until recently.

32:04.798 --> 32:07.008
He has that same shirt,
and he drinks scotch.

32:12.139 --> 32:15.559
He's a loose cannon, sure,
but kidnapping a kid?

32:15.642 --> 32:16.685
He's done it before.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.228
Done what before?

32:19.438 --> 32:21.481
Lied. Covered things up.

32:22.107 --> 32:23.567
He's damaged, Joe.

32:23.650 --> 32:25.569
He turns up out of the blue
after 10 years.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.737
I thought he'd probably died
in some Thai prison.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.739
That doesn't make him a kidnapper.

32:30.198 --> 32:31.700
He grew up in The Kindred.

32:32.367 --> 32:35.162
It's not like we were taught
that stealing children is a crime.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.333
I'll make some calls.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.295
And see if we can track
where he stopped for petrol

32:43.378 --> 32:45.338
and match it to the time
Carrie disappeared.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.216
And you'll really do it this time?

32:49.050 --> 32:50.135
I'll really do it.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.310
(paper rustles)

33:00.562 --> 33:02.939
-How's Leila?
-Married last year.

33:03.857 --> 33:04.691
Baby on the way.

33:08.528 --> 33:09.988
Grandpa Joe, eh?

33:11.198 --> 33:12.199
Yeah.

33:14.534 --> 33:15.452
Here.

33:16.828 --> 33:17.787
Take this for your dinner.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.042
Thanks.

33:23.126 --> 33:24.628
LEILA: Everyone gets
more pocket money than me.

33:24.711 --> 33:26.254
-DINA: Everyone, huh?
-PAUL: I do.

33:26.338 --> 33:27.839
DINA: If you both did your chores.

33:29.216 --> 33:30.967
You boys played so well on Saturday.

33:31.551 --> 33:34.679
PAUL: Well, if we win the grand final,
I get to bring the trophy home.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.473
-It's the perks of being Captain, huh?
-Mm.

33:36.556 --> 33:37.599
JOE: You're Captain?

33:37.682 --> 33:38.767
That's great.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.852
He's been Captain all season, Yusuf.

33:42.646 --> 33:43.563
Right.

33:45.899 --> 33:49.069
So, Amy, have you started school yet?

33:51.696 --> 33:52.822
Not yet.

33:52.906 --> 33:53.990
What grade are you in?

33:54.574 --> 33:55.784
PAUL: Why is your hair white?

33:58.036 --> 34:00.789
Do you, um...
do you have any hobbies you enjoy?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.966
Okay, uh... what about this one?

The answer is still no.

37:08.768 --> 37:13.106
Why did you write in your diary
that Henrik kidnapped Asha?

37:13.606 --> 37:14.983
Mommy told me to.

37:16.776 --> 37:18.278
Did she tell you to run away?

37:19.195 --> 37:21.448
She said the diary would protect her.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.909
Protect all of us.

37:28.079 --> 37:29.497
But it didn't, did it?

37:29.914 --> 37:32.208
Yeah, it did. She's safe.

37:32.292 --> 37:33.460
But what about us?

37:35.128 --> 37:36.337
She doesn't want us.

37:36.671 --> 37:37.756
She does.

37:38.298 --> 37:40.717
She just can't come back and get us
because of the Blue Devils.

37:40.800 --> 37:42.719
I don't believe in Blue Devils.

37:44.512 --> 37:46.765
She's going to come back for us,
I know she is.

37:48.600 --> 37:50.059
I'm 16, Amy.

37:50.435 --> 37:52.395
I don't have to go to a foster family.

37:53.688 --> 37:57.233
I can get my own place and you can come
live with me until she comes.

37:59.027 --> 38:00.737
I'm going to tell them I lied.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.449
You can't do that, Amy.

38:05.158 --> 38:06.367
We have to stick together.

38:06.451 --> 38:08.578
I'm going to tell them
that the photo was Asha.

38:09.370 --> 38:13.082
And that Mommy made Tamsin steal her
and that you drove the van.

38:19.172 --> 38:21.090
-You can't say that.
-I can.

38:24.636 --> 38:25.678
Fine.

38:29.015 --> 38:31.643
Then when Mommy comes to get me,
I'll tell her what you said,

38:31.726 --> 38:33.186
and then nobody will want you.

38:36.147 --> 38:37.732
You were there, too, Amy,

38:38.817 --> 38:40.026
that day in the van.

It's Joe Saad.

39:18.231 --> 39:19.315
Been a long time.

39:21.526 --> 39:22.652
I need a favor.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.114
Not again, Joe.

39:27.282 --> 39:28.116
We're square.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.411
We'll only be square
once Sara McFetridge is found.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.000
What is it?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.128
I know who took Carrie Anderson.

39:42.171 --> 39:43.798
Carrie's been found, Joe.

39:45.133 --> 39:46.050
It's all over the news.

39:50.346 --> 39:52.974
The community of Woodfield
are rejoicing today

39:53.057 --> 39:56.352
at the discovery of missing
eight-year-old schoolgirl Carrie Anderson

39:56.436 --> 39:58.479
in the bushland of Lake Eildon.

39:58.897 --> 40:02.358
Detectives will speak to Carrie
when they get medical clearance.

40:02.567 --> 40:04.402
But they don't believe there's foul play.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.071
REPORTER: Carrie was found disoriented
and suffering severe hypothermia.

40:07.155 --> 40:08.865
It's good news, Freya.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.867
At least this one,

40:12.410 --> 40:13.620
she found her way home.

40:14.203 --> 40:15.413
FREYA: Yeah.

40:15.496 --> 40:16.706
REPORTER: ...the rain,
with temperatures dropping

40:16.789 --> 40:18.833
as low as two degrees overnight.

40:19.500 --> 40:22.712
Carrie would have had access
to the fresh water of Lake Eildon

40:22.921 --> 40:26.758
and it's possible she found shelter
in the many abandoned fishing shacks

40:26.841 --> 40:28.635
and holiday homes in the area.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.514
(foreboding music playing)

40:41.481 --> 40:43.483
WILKES: Joe, I've given you your head,

40:44.525 --> 40:47.904
but you've got no proof The Kindred
is connected to Sara's disappearance.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.489
Forensics have found no link.

40:49.572 --> 40:52.742
We get Adrienne extradited,
then we subpoena her followers.

40:52.825 --> 40:54.243
Blow this thing wide open.

40:54.327 --> 40:56.496
I need charges to extradite her.

40:56.579 --> 40:59.540
Abuse. Forgery. Kidnapping.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.876
Drug administration to minors.
What more do you want?

41:01.960 --> 41:03.419
None of it links back to her.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.631
Sara McFetridge was at their compound.

41:07.340 --> 41:08.925
Amy Beaufort confirmed it.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.261
The... The DPP will never accept charges

41:12.345 --> 41:15.515
based on the evidence
of a psychologically damaged kid.

41:15.848 --> 41:18.142
And even if they did, you can't put
traumatized kids on the stand.

41:18.226 --> 41:20.103
The defense will destroy them.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.816
Just let them move on with their lives.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.317
Leave it to Welfare.

41:26.818 --> 41:28.569
This isn't a Welfare issue.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.406
A little girl never came home

41:31.489 --> 41:35.326
and Adrienne Beaufort knows exactly
what happened to her.

41:38.371 --> 41:40.581
All right, find me a watertight charge

41:40.748 --> 41:43.001
and I'll have Interpol slap
a red notice on her.

41:43.668 --> 41:44.502
Thank you.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.384
(telephone ringing in distance)

41:52.760 --> 41:54.762
(indistinct chatter)

42:00.351 --> 42:02.562
(suspenseful music playing)

42:07.650 --> 42:09.944
-Saad.
-RECEPTIONIST: Someone here to see you.

42:14.365 --> 42:19.454
HENRIK: I confess to the kidnapping
of Sara McFetridge.

42:20.204 --> 42:24.751
I took her against her will
and I held her captive.

42:26.169 --> 42:30.173
It had nothing to do with The Kindred.

42:31.007 --> 42:32.592
There's no one else involved.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.057
Can you tell us where Sara is now?

42:39.807 --> 42:40.767
I don't know.

42:42.852 --> 42:46.105
I realize what I did was wrong,
so I drove her home.

42:46.189 --> 42:48.191
But she never came home.

42:48.274 --> 42:52.195
Well, it was late and she was asleep
so I left her on the doorstep.

42:52.528 --> 42:53.988
Why did you kidnap her, Henrik?

42:55.281 --> 42:57.200
I wanted a daughter.

42:57.658 --> 42:58.910
You mean Adrienne did.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.662
Was this her way of stealing children

43:01.746 --> 43:03.414
now that she couldn't get them
from hospitals anymore?

43:03.831 --> 43:06.667
I have given you my statement.

43:09.796 --> 43:10.880
(car door closes)

43:24.060 --> 43:26.270
(birds chirping)

43:35.029 --> 43:36.197
(knocking)

43:38.491 --> 43:39.325
You okay?

43:41.244 --> 43:43.204
You'll find Asha now, won't you?

43:48.793 --> 43:50.211
Welcome to your new home, Amy.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.380
Come on in.

43:52.463 --> 43:53.756

One heart together, we are united...

45:54.252 --> 45:58.839
BRYCE: There are things known
and there are things unknown.

45:59.632 --> 46:00.675
The truth...

46:03.052 --> 46:04.971
lies in between.

46:05.846 --> 46:11.686
We must have the courage to open the door
to the in between.

46:13.604 --> 46:15.940
An alternate perception, as it were.

46:18.025 --> 46:22.738
Now, perhaps more than
at any other time in history,

46:23.322 --> 46:27.159
we have the opportunity to,
to look beyond what is known,

46:27.451 --> 46:29.036
and rebuild our world.

46:31.455 --> 46:33.749

46:37.420 --> 46:39.630
Help! Let me out!

46:41.716 --> 46:43.259
Let me out!

46:55.146 --> 46:57.148
(breathes deeply)

46:58.774 --> 47:01.444
Amy, help me!

47:02.236 --> 47:07.992
There is a splendor inside us
and it cannot be cowed.

47:09.827 --> 47:14.332
You must open the door
to receive the radiance.

47:14.915 --> 47:20.796
ADRIENNE: Darkness will lure us
with promises, tempt us with riches.

47:21.672 --> 47:25.217
But we must never stop seeking the light,

47:26.010 --> 47:29.013
and the grace of the unknowable truth.

47:35.936 --> 47:37.938
(closing theme music)
