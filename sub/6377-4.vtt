WEBVTT

00:11.387 --> 00:14.379
Help! Somebody, please!

00:21.314 --> 00:22.349
Sweetie.

00:23.608 --> 00:26.600
What did you get yourself into?

00:33.743 --> 00:34.903
What the fuck?

00:35.077 --> 00:38.695
Oh, my God, Jason. Oh, my God.

00:40.124 --> 00:41.284
It's okay.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.166
Like hell it is! Look at her.
She is definitely not okay.

00:44.337 --> 00:46.453
Beating on me ain't gonna
change anything none.

00:46.631 --> 00:49.122
Darling, I heard yelling.

00:50.968 --> 00:54.927
Sweet Lord in heaven, no.

01:02.647 --> 01:05.639
-What did you do?
-Me?

01:05.816 --> 01:08.148
I found her, Miss Lebvre. He--
He just got here.

01:08.319 --> 01:10.310
I saw you last night, Jason Stackhouse.

01:10.488 --> 01:13.730
I heard y'all fighting, then she took
a shot at you and you ran off.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.318
And now she's dead.

01:16.327 --> 01:20.115
-Jason?
-Yeah. We had a fight.

01:20.289 --> 01:21.870
But I came here to apologize.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.578
She fired a gun at you,
and you come back to apologize?

01:24.752 --> 01:28.916
Sook. I didn't do this.
You gotta believe me.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.422
Well, I'm calling the police.

01:32.009 --> 01:33.749
Then call them.

01:35.930 --> 01:38.342
I had nothing to do with this.

03:21.952 --> 03:23.567
I don't get it.

03:25.039 --> 03:26.950
She was so pretty.

03:27.124 --> 03:30.912
Well, maybe it was just her time.

03:31.295 --> 03:33.286
She was only 23 years old.

03:33.464 --> 03:36.046
Ain't no 23-year-old in the world
whose time has come.

03:36.217 --> 03:39.175
Hey, y'all. What'd I miss?

03:40.346 --> 03:44.305
-Dawn's dead, Mama.
-I know. What a shame.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.306
Who they got in there?

03:46.477 --> 03:48.058
Jason and Sookie Stackhouse.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.562
She found the body, but it sounds like
they think he might have done it.

03:51.732 --> 03:52.892
Well, he didn't.

03:53.067 --> 03:55.649
-Well, then who did?
-I don't know.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.936
Probably the same person
that killed Maudette.

03:58.114 --> 03:59.320
| tell you one thing, man.

03:59.490 --> 04:03.483
We too small a town to be losing girls
one after the other like this.

04:03.828 --> 04:07.662
-Whoever it is, I hope they fry the fuck.
-Rene.

04:08.332 --> 04:10.072
Pardon my language, Miss Maxine.

04:10.251 --> 04:14.494
No need to apologize, Rene.
We're all excited.

04:15.673 --> 04:19.165
To be a fly on the wall
in that apartment right now.

04:23.097 --> 04:26.305
And I realize you've been through a lot,
and you're scared.

04:26.475 --> 04:29.638
But I need you to try and remember
when you got here...

04:29.812 --> 04:32.679
...was the door open orjust unlocked?

04:34.650 --> 04:35.981
Open, I think.

04:39.530 --> 04:43.193
Pisses me off the way she keeps calling
me "Andy, " everyone cal/s Bud "sheriff. "

04:43.367 --> 04:48.202
Why can't they call me "detective"? When
am I gonna get some respect around here?

04:48.372 --> 04:51.330
Would you look at that?
A ﬁne pair of perfect, natural breasts.

04:51.500 --> 04:54.867
I'd have laid down money
that they were fake. Well done, God.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.173
Though and then, not so well done,
letting her die like you did.

04:58.716 --> 05:02.550
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck am I gonna do?
I already got out of this once.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.383
No way they gonna let me walk again.
And I'm too damn pretty to go to prison.

05:06.557 --> 05:08.218
SooMe.

05:08.392 --> 05:10.098
Sorry, what was the question?

05:10.269 --> 05:12.635
Is that the exact position
you found her in?

05:12.813 --> 05:15.725
I covered her up with a sheet,
but I don't think I touched her.

05:15.900 --> 05:17.356
| wish you hadn't done that.

05:17.526 --> 05:20.814
Next time we find a friend of mine dead,
I'll try to remember that.

05:20.988 --> 05:23.400
I keep waiting for this heat to break,
but it won't.

05:23.574 --> 05:26.737
-lt's stubborn, this summer we're having.
-Oh, I know.

05:27.870 --> 05:32.580
"| feel like a cat on a hot tin roof."

05:32.917 --> 05:34.248
That's from a play.

05:36.587 --> 05:39.420
Well, I sure could use a beer right now, me.
Y'all want some?

05:39.590 --> 05:41.421
-If you're gonna get one.
-Bring me one.

05:41.592 --> 05:44.629
While you're in there, would you mind
rustling up a bucket of ice?

05:44.803 --> 05:47.886
And those nice plastic cups we got
at the Super Save-A-Bunch.

05:48.057 --> 05:50.343
-Yeah.
-And maybe some of those paper doilies.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.600
Lord, woman,
what's with you and them doilies?

05:52.937 --> 05:55.019
Doilies are to protect the table.
We outside.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.726
They might wanna put them down
on the car or something.

05:57.900 --> 06:01.233
-Just bring the doilies, please.
-Fine.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.025
If all conversations end
with them saying "fine"...

06:05.199 --> 06:07.190
...why do they bother putting up a fight?

06:09.370 --> 06:11.281
This fight you heard
Dawn and Jason having...

06:11.455 --> 06:13.195
...were you able to make any of it out?

06:13.374 --> 06:17.458
Just the tail end, right before the gunshot.
He called her...

06:17.795 --> 06:18.784
...a very bad word.

06:21.507 --> 06:23.543
What was that word?

06:24.134 --> 06:28.093
Well, it starts with a B.

06:29.139 --> 06:30.595
| see.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.762
Okay.

06:34.937 --> 06:40.182
-That'll be all. Thank you, Miss Lebvre.
-Oh, you're welcome, Andy, dear.

06:41.443 --> 06:44.810
No one dignified would die without
your unden/vear on in the first place.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.821
-Sure?
-Yeah.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.325
Sookie, here.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.036
God.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.134
Hey. Hey.

07:09.305 --> 07:12.797
If you're gonna make me wait in the car,
can you at least turn on the a.c.?

07:12.975 --> 07:14.465
I know you can hear me.

07:18.022 --> 07:19.853
Fuck.

07:26.196 --> 07:28.812
Oh, fuck.

07:49.511 --> 07:52.548
Couldn't hear me yelling?
Car's hotter than hell.

07:52.723 --> 07:53.712
Shutup.

08:00.230 --> 08:05.850
-Thank you, Sookie. We'll be in touch.
-Bud, let's roll before I melt in here.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.318
Stop. Mama, I don't need any sunblock.

08:08.489 --> 08:11.276
Oh, please, Hoyt,
if anyone needs sun block, it's you.

08:11.450 --> 08:14.613
Your skin's whiter than Desitin.

08:14.912 --> 08:17.244
Mama, I'm gonna move out.
I swear it, lwill.

08:17.414 --> 08:20.952
No, you won't.
Now get down so I can get your neck.

08:32.596 --> 08:34.427
Came as soon as I heard.

08:44.900 --> 08:47.767
I'm sorry you had to be
the one to find her.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.270
It was gonna be somebody. Right?

08:52.241 --> 08:54.072
lguess.

08:56.704 --> 08:58.911
Oh, I tell you, Sook...

08:59.915 --> 09:03.658
...sometimes I don't even recognize
this world we're living in.

09:04.545 --> 09:07.787
-I mean, goddamn it.
-Be careful, now.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.377
God didn't do this.

09:11.719 --> 09:13.801
--vampires. There's no way....

09:13.971 --> 09:17.088
You think maybe I should
shut down the bar for the day?

09:17.266 --> 09:21.305
All that'd do is deny people a good, stiff
drink on the day they could use it the most.

09:21.478 --> 09:24.720
-Yeah, but--
-I know it's supposed to be my day off...

09:24.898 --> 09:29.016
...but the last thing I need right now
is time alone with my thoughts.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.065
All right, then.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.028
We'll open.

09:34.742 --> 09:38.200
I may be late, though. I gotta swing by
home and tell Gran what's going on.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.326
lt's Bon Temps, she already knows.

09:40.497 --> 09:41.486
Still...

09:43.667 --> 09:45.328
...with Jason and everything--

09:45.502 --> 09:47.754
-Excuse me, are you Mr. Merlotte?
-Yeah.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.333
Detective in charge
tells me you're the landlord.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.667
That's right.

09:51.842 --> 09:55.050
We need to get in the victim's storage unit,
but we don't have a key.

09:55.220 --> 09:58.178
If you could find one,
it'd be a big help right about now.

10:03.771 --> 10:07.480
Miss? Could you please let us by?

10:13.363 --> 10:16.196
Hey, Sookie.
Meet Neil Jones, my new apprentice.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.816
He's from Kentucky.

10:19.119 --> 10:20.655
Hi.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.744
Hi.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.952
Lift, kid. Come on, lift.

10:26.710 --> 10:31.704
You don't have to be too careful.
Ain't gonna hurt her. Okay.

10:40.974 --> 10:46.389
So you had a fight, she took a shot at you
with a gun, and you just left?

10:46.563 --> 10:50.556
Didn't see her again till you showed up with
flowers and found her dead this morning?

10:50.734 --> 10:53.066
That's my story,
and it ain't gonna change.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.319
Except it just did change.

10:55.906 --> 10:59.069
You just admitted
you're the one who found her, not Sookie.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.359
No, I didn't.

11:03.413 --> 11:06.997
You're trying to trick me.
It don't count if I get tricked.

11:07.876 --> 11:09.082
Does it?

11:10.546 --> 11:14.334
Make you hot, Jason?
Killing girls and sticking it to them?

11:14.925 --> 11:17.917
-No.
-See, I think it does.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.835
I think it turns you on.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.095
Sounds to me like it turns you on.

11:26.353 --> 11:29.345
Tell me, is that how you do it?
Kill them then fuck them?

11:29.523 --> 11:31.263
Or do you fuck them
and then kill them?

11:31.984 --> 11:33.019
Or I know.

11:33.861 --> 11:39.356
You strangle them as you're fucking them,
don't you, you sick fuck?

11:40.075 --> 11:43.442
How many other women you done this to
besides Dawn and Maudette?

11:43.620 --> 11:46.612
Maudette? |-- I didn't....

11:48.458 --> 11:50.449
I gotta use the bathroom.

11:52.588 --> 11:55.125
Man's gotta pee, Andy.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.920
-Bathroom? Bathroom?
-lt's over there.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.452
Son of a bitch.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.235
You shouldn't have laughed.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.495
What are you talking about?

12:28.665 --> 12:31.998
When he came at me with that crack
about me being the one turned on...

12:32.169 --> 12:35.286
-...you shouldn't have laughed.
-I guess itjust struck me as funny.

12:35.464 --> 12:38.251
You were working so hard on him,
and I don't think he did it.

12:39.176 --> 12:41.667
What the fuck?

12:45.933 --> 12:48.174
We got two dead girls
and this dumb fuck admits...

12:48.352 --> 12:51.594
...to sleeping with both of them
within hours before they were killed.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.185
Yeah, and both our dead girls
got bit by vampires too.

12:55.359 --> 12:58.442
Far as I can tell,
Stackhouse don't have fangs.

13:18.715 --> 13:21.707
What the hell you doing in there,
Stackhouse?

13:22.719 --> 13:24.801
I'll be out in a minute.

13:25.222 --> 13:26.837
What the fuck was that?

13:32.896 --> 13:35.478
Fuck, you gotta be shitting rne.

13:46.576 --> 13:47.565
Hold on!

13:48.537 --> 13:51.574
I said, hold on. I'll be there.

13:51.748 --> 13:54.239
Sheriff Dearborne. Andy.

13:54.418 --> 13:55.999
I hear you guys brought Jason in.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.421
-So?
-You charging him with anything?

13:58.588 --> 14:00.624
-Not yet, no.
-Asking him some questions.

14:00.799 --> 14:03.916
I assume he's been
properly Mirandized, then.

14:06.179 --> 14:09.637
Please tell me you informed him
he has a right to have an attorney present.

14:09.808 --> 14:13.892
Maybe. Doesn't matter though,
because he's got you here now.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.011
Was that funny because I'm a woman...

14:16.189 --> 14:19.522
-...or because I'm a black woman?
-I thought it was funny, you know...

14:19.693 --> 14:22.435
...because you can talk like a lawyer
but you ain't one.

14:22.612 --> 14:26.104
How do you know all this anyway?
You been taking night classes?

14:26.283 --> 14:29.525
School is for white people looking for
other white people to read to them.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.285
I figure | save my money
and read to myself.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.783
-Tara.
-|'m getting you out of here.

14:37.961 --> 14:41.249
-Like hell you are.
-You charging him with anything?

14:41.423 --> 14:46.463
-She's right. We can't hold him.
-He can't even say where he was last night.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.718
Least he could've done
was make shit up.

14:48.889 --> 14:51.722
Listen, I told you where l was.
I was home alone. Sleeping.

14:51.892 --> 14:54.634
You never sleep alone, Stackhouse,
and you know it.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.144
-Guys, he was with me.
-What's this, now?

14:58.315 --> 15:01.523
lf y'all were together last night,
how come he don't seem to know?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.900
| asked him not to tell anybody about us.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.778
He's surprised to hear me
being the one blabbing about it.

15:06.948 --> 15:08.654
Aren't you, baby?

15:09.242 --> 15:10.823
Yeah.

15:12.329 --> 15:14.866
Wha--? You buying this?

15:15.040 --> 15:18.908
People think because we got vampires out
in the open, race isn't the issue no more.

15:19.086 --> 15:22.044
You ever see the way folks look
at mixed couples in this town?

15:22.214 --> 15:24.330
Race may not be the hot-button
issue it once was...

15:24.508 --> 15:26.294
...but it's still a button you can push.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.459
-Would you be willing to go on record?
-Yes.

15:28.637 --> 15:32.004
-Understanding you're lying, you'd be guilt--
-Perjury. I know.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.468
You got a Bible?
l'll swear on it right here.

15:35.185 --> 15:39.269
Jason and l were together last night
and it was a beautiful thing.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.610
Okay. You're free to go.

15:47.489 --> 15:48.774
Jesus.

15:49.366 --> 15:52.984
-Come on, baby. Let's take you home.
-Okay, baby.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.993
Hey, Gran.

16:03.171 --> 16:05.207
-I heard.
-About Jason too?

16:06.550 --> 16:09.587
-He didn't do it, you know.
-I know.

16:09.761 --> 16:14.130
Jason may be many things,
but he is not a murderer.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.342
I know.

16:15.517 --> 16:19.055
The thing is though, Sookie, in all the years
that I've lived in Bon Temps...

16:19.229 --> 16:22.312
...I can't recall but two,
maybe three murders.

16:22.482 --> 16:26.851
And now there are two in one week.
People are not gonna stand for it.

16:27.028 --> 16:30.566
And if the police can't find the person
who did it, they're gonna find Jason.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.072
-He needs your help.
-Gran, how am I supposed to--?

16:33.243 --> 16:35.325
You use the gift God gave you.

16:35.495 --> 16:38.987
Listen in on people, keep your ears open.
You're bound to hear something.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.282
It's got nothing to do with my ears.

16:41.459 --> 16:47.250
Whatever it is you use to listen, use it.
He is your brother, Sookie.

16:49.634 --> 16:50.669
Okay.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.628
Good girl.

17:06.359 --> 17:09.476
Would you come and pick up
your fucking orders--?

17:10.405 --> 17:13.067
--killed Dawn,
I wonder if he had sex with her or not.

17:13.241 --> 17:14.777
Seems like a waste if he didn't.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.283
She sure was pretty.
Never even looked at me.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.571
Can’t get that letter in Cosmo
out of my head. "How much better...

17:20.749 --> 17:24.617
...could an orgasm with a vampire be ?"
I wonder, is it that much better?

17:24.794 --> 17:27.126
What the hell is this world coming to?

17:27.297 --> 17:29.913
Dead fucks, niggers
and regular folk all living together.

17:30.091 --> 17:32.958
If God wanted it like this,
he'd have made us look the same.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.047
Maybe these really are the end times.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.133
I don’t know
what everybody's upset about.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.844
These whores had it coming,
hanging out in vampire bars.

17:40.018 --> 17:43.385
-That ain't natural, and it ain't safe.
-You seem sad that girl is dead.

17:43.563 --> 17:47.306
I wonder if y'all were friends. If you were,
that means you're probably next.

17:47.484 --> 17:48.769
Fucking fang-bangers are crazy,
every last one of you.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.570
Just like those women who write
love letters to serial killers in prison.

17:54.491 --> 17:57.403
Hey. I asked for ranch dressing
with these fries.

17:57.827 --> 17:59.408
Two margaritas.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.867
That Dawn sure left us high and dry,
didn't she?

18:03.166 --> 18:05.327
It's not like she meant not to be here.

18:05.502 --> 18:08.335
No, but if she didn't spend
her nights off...

18:08.505 --> 18:11.588
...at that vamp bar in Shreveport,
she still would be.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.300
Did ljust hear you right, Arlene?
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

18:16.471 --> 18:19.178
Please. Ain't there a part of you
think she had it coming?

18:19.349 --> 18:22.557
No, not a single part.
And I'm taking your ranch.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.388
Hey.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.098
-You're late.
-Sorry, boss.

18:34.572 --> 18:37.405
Hey, listen, we should probably talk.

18:38.952 --> 18:41.034
About last night?

18:41.246 --> 18:43.202
What about last night?

18:43.373 --> 18:45.864
You're gonna make this
hard on me, aren't you?

18:46.042 --> 18:48.249
Actually, no,
I'm gonna make it very, very easy.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.376
Nothing happened between us last night.

18:50.547 --> 18:53.664
And if anybody asks,
you didn't see me at all, okay?

18:53.842 --> 18:56.208
I'm telling people
I spent the night with Jason.

18:56.553 --> 18:58.544
-Jason Stackhouse?
-Yes.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.053
l was with Jason last night.

19:00.223 --> 19:03.681
And if you say different,
they're gonna haul both our asses into jail.

19:03.852 --> 19:05.513
You lied to the police for him?

19:06.229 --> 19:07.969
Shit, Tara.

19:08.315 --> 19:11.853
I know you carry a torch for the guy,
but I don't get it, I really don't.

19:12.027 --> 19:13.983
There's more to Jason
than meets the eye.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.985
Deep down he is a very good person.

19:18.742 --> 19:21.825
Oh, yeah.

19:38.595 --> 19:40.802
Fuck!

19:42.766 --> 19:45.428
Go fucking down.

19:55.904 --> 19:57.895
Oh, come on.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.732
Come on.

20:01.910 --> 20:04.947
In Iraq today,
10 U. S. Marines were killed when a--

20:09.292 --> 20:11.954
Motherfucker.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.626
Oh, baby.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.800
My sweet, sweet baby.

20:28.311 --> 20:30.097
Hey, baby.

20:30.271 --> 20:31.977
Sure is too bad about Dawn.

20:32.148 --> 20:36.232
I already miss the way her butt used
to hang out of the bottom of her shorts.

20:36.403 --> 20:39.611
Have mercy on you, Sookie Stackhouse.
I hope that brother of yours...

20:39.781 --> 20:42.568
...gets what he deserves
and he fries for what he's done.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.653
Crying shame is what it is.

20:44.828 --> 20:47.114
This place ain't gonna be the same
without Dawn.

20:47.288 --> 20:51.372
She had the prettiest, nicest smile.
Why was I so scared to talk to her?

20:51.543 --> 20:53.829
Now I'll never know
what her voice sounded like.

20:54.003 --> 20:57.336
I bet it sounded like angels
and parakeets mixed together.

20:57.507 --> 20:59.623
Hoyt Fortenberry.

21:01.344 --> 21:04.086
| just wanted to say thank you.

21:04.597 --> 21:07.259
For.... For what?

21:11.354 --> 21:15.597
Okay. All right then.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.774
Jason, you look me in the eye
and you tell me the truth.

21:21.948 --> 21:25.190
-Did you kill Dawn?
-What? No.

21:25.827 --> 21:27.442
Jesus, Sook.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.404
Look, when Maudette died...

21:31.583 --> 21:34.370
...I thought I might've done it,
and it turned out I didn't.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.785
With Dawn,
I don't even think | might've done it.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.079
-So I know I didn't.
-You swear?

21:39.674 --> 21:42.290
The way you're acting,
seems like you want it to be me.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.927
Sorry. Gran asked me to listen in on folks,
see if I can't clear your name.

21:46.097 --> 21:48.213
And sometimes it's hard--

21:48.683 --> 21:51.720
I gotta stop you. It sounds
like you're revving up for a long one.

21:51.895 --> 21:55.683
And I really need to see Lafayette.
I'll talk to you later.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.183
What the fuck, Lafayette?

22:00.570 --> 22:02.356
I'm busy. What's your problem?

22:02.530 --> 22:06.489
My problem is my dick.
It's been hard since 3:00.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.820
Something ain't right
with that vamp blood--

22:08.995 --> 22:10.235
Will you shut the fuck up?

22:10.413 --> 22:12.620
-Sorry.
-Watch your loud ass.

22:12.790 --> 22:15.042
Ain't nothing wrong
with the shit I sold you.

22:15.668 --> 22:16.999
What the hell is it?

22:17.670 --> 22:20.377
-How much you take?
-The whole thing.

22:23.885 --> 22:26.547
You took the whole thing?

22:26.763 --> 22:27.923
You a dizzy motherfucker.

22:28.097 --> 22:32.056
I said one drop, two max,
and you took the whole thing?

22:32.227 --> 22:35.890
Look, l was in the backseat of a cop car,
I had it on me, and l panicked, okay?

22:36.064 --> 22:39.056
Give me something to make it go away.
I don't care what it costs.

22:39.234 --> 22:42.601
Ain't no antidote to V, boyfriend.

22:46.115 --> 22:50.279
When my grandpa was alive, he had gout.

22:51.788 --> 22:57.374
And he said just the weight of a sheet
on his big toe was too much to bear.

22:58.002 --> 23:01.915
So help me God,
that's exactly what this feels like.

23:02.507 --> 23:05.294
Maybe you should try rubbing one out.

23:05.635 --> 23:07.125
Were you listening to me?

23:07.303 --> 23:10.761
I got gout of the dick.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.885
Vampire.

23:17.063 --> 23:18.894
What's he doing in here?

23:27.949 --> 23:29.155
Any fries for you?

23:36.457 --> 23:37.663
What you want?

23:38.543 --> 23:41.205
May l have a bottle of O-negative,
please?

23:42.297 --> 23:43.662
A-negative's all we got.

23:43.840 --> 23:46.582
-A-negative then.
-Okay.

23:46.759 --> 23:50.001
Pretty crowded in here tonight.
Something going on?

23:53.141 --> 23:56.679
Sam just bought a case.
We got O-neg and A-neg. Plenty of each.

23:56.853 --> 23:58.684
Fuck him. I'm giving him A.

23:58.855 --> 24:01.767
And don't microwave it neither.
He can have it cold.

24:01.941 --> 24:04.023
You are so bad.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.775
Are we out of O?

24:13.953 --> 24:16.535
Blood is blood.
What difference does it make?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.867
He prefers O.

24:19.042 --> 24:20.578
I'll take it to him if you like.

24:20.752 --> 24:23.619
Well, good. He gives me the creeps.

24:30.428 --> 24:33.340
-Come on.
-Where are we going?

24:40.605 --> 24:42.891
You know my friend who works here?
Dawn?

24:43.066 --> 24:45.648
-Someone killed her last night.
-How?

24:46.235 --> 24:48.226
-Say you're sorry.
-Excuse me?

24:48.404 --> 24:51.146
You wanna learn to fit in?
You gotta say you're sorry.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.612
You don't even have to mean it.
Lord knows they don't most of the time.

24:54.786 --> 24:56.401
I am sorry.

24:56.829 --> 24:59.696
Thank you.
Anyway, I'm the one who found her.

24:59.874 --> 25:02.115
Strangled. Cops think it was my brother.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.877
-Was it?
-No, he's not capable of it.

25:06.047 --> 25:09.915
I've been around long enough to know
anyone is capable ofjust about anything.

25:10.093 --> 25:11.173
He didn't do it.

25:12.929 --> 25:15.261
So I've been listening in
on people's thoughts...

25:15.431 --> 25:17.547
...hoping I might hear something
to clear him.

25:17.725 --> 25:20.592
Apparently there's this vampire bar
where Maudette and Dawn...

25:20.770 --> 25:23.603
...used to hang out at in Shreveport.
You know it?

25:23.773 --> 25:25.855
Fangtasia.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.691
Fangtasia?

25:28.861 --> 25:31.568
You have to remember
that most vampires are very old.

25:31.739 --> 25:34.116
Puns used to be
the highest form of humor.

25:36.202 --> 25:41.322
Well, l was thinking if I went there
I could do some sniffing around.

25:41.499 --> 25:43.364
You think maybe you can take me?

25:44.460 --> 25:46.621
-How about tonight?
-The sooner the better.

25:46.796 --> 25:49.629
ljust gotta tell Sam I'm leaving,
and run home and change.

25:49.799 --> 25:52.962
-Meet you there.
-Thank you.

25:53.636 --> 25:58.221
Bill, I'm asking you this as a friend, okay?
This is not a date.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.131
Fine.

26:01.269 --> 26:05.638
-lt's not a date. I'm serious.
-As am |.

26:15.616 --> 26:17.607
Hey, Sam?

26:18.244 --> 26:21.236
Is it all right
if I take the rest of the night off?

26:21.664 --> 26:22.995
Why?

26:23.166 --> 26:25.327
I need to go to that vampire bar
in Shreveport.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.789
So I can snoop around and see
if I can clear my brother's name.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.963
Mr. Compton was kind enough
to agree to take me.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.169
Mr. Compton?

26:34.510 --> 26:38.344
Oh, Jesus. Sookie, you gonna
get yourself killed, you know that?

26:38.514 --> 26:40.345
I'll be fine.

26:40.516 --> 26:42.677
Baby, the fact that you think
you'll be fine...

26:42.852 --> 26:45.184
...only proves
just how not fine you're gonna be.

26:45.354 --> 26:49.097
Vampires think about one thing,
and one thing only:

26:49.400 --> 26:51.732
Drinking your blood.

26:51.903 --> 26:53.359
Like humans aren't bloodthirsty?

26:53.529 --> 26:56.396
People wanna see my brother hang
for a crime he didn't commit.

26:56.574 --> 26:59.862
-ls that what you want?
-No, I'm not saying don't help your brother.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.402
I thought you were for
the Vampire Rights Amendment.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.912
I think they should be able
to have their own bars.

27:05.082 --> 27:08.370
-| just don't think people ought to go there.
-Separate but equal?

27:08.544 --> 27:11.627
I don't give a shit about equal.
We can give them more than we got.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.538
Just so long as everything's separate.

27:13.716 --> 27:17.550
Well, I'm sorry you feel that way.
But I'm going.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.047
Well, I can't stop you.

27:22.225 --> 27:25.217
No. You can't.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.908
Penny for your thoughts.

27:50.086 --> 27:52.327
I thought you liked
not knowing what I'm thinking.

27:52.505 --> 27:54.746
Most of the time I do.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.249
You won't care for it.

27:58.427 --> 28:01.009
That doesn't mean I don't wanna know.

28:05.268 --> 28:07.179
You look like vampire bait.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.265
What's that supposed to mean?

28:11.941 --> 28:16.355
I promised your grandmother no harm
would come to you at Fangtasia tonight.

28:16.946 --> 28:21.235
I'm not sure I'm gonna be able to keep
that promise with you dressed like this.

28:22.660 --> 28:26.152
So are you saying
you think I look nice?

28:26.831 --> 28:31.165
Doesn't matter what I think.
This isn't a date, remember?

28:42.346 --> 28:45.554
This ain't a part of my job description,
goddamn it.

28:45.725 --> 28:48.137
-Don't turn around.
-What--?

28:48.811 --> 28:52.144
-I said, don't look at me.
-What the hell are you doing?

28:54.775 --> 28:56.231
I think I might have OD'd.

28:56.861 --> 28:59.227
Oh, my God. On what?

29:01.490 --> 29:04.448
-V.
-You're doing V now?

29:05.077 --> 29:06.408
It was my first time.

29:06.579 --> 29:09.821
Where on earth did you come across V
in this town?

29:10.041 --> 29:11.281
Lafayette.

29:11.459 --> 29:16.954
My cousin is dealing vampire blood now?
Goddamn idiot.

29:17.131 --> 29:20.123
At least that explains why
I walked in on you dancing around...

29:20.301 --> 29:22.792
...in that Laura Bush mask yesterday.

29:22.970 --> 29:26.508
Because I gotta tell you, without a reason,
that was some fucked up shit.

29:29.352 --> 29:31.468
All right, let me see it.

29:31.938 --> 29:34.145
How long have you had the erection?

29:34.315 --> 29:36.977
-Well, how do you know?
-I read.

29:37.151 --> 29:40.484
You're not the first vain-ass,
body-conscious ex-jock to overdo the V...

29:40.655 --> 29:42.816
...and wind up
with an acute case of priapism.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.855
-Pria-- What?
-Priapism.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.197
Now, lift the rib eye
and let me see what we're dealing with.

29:55.211 --> 29:59.329
-Whoa, J-- Jason, that's....
-Yeah, it's bad, ain't it?

29:59.507 --> 30:01.463
We gotta get you to a hospital now.

30:01.634 --> 30:05.673
-No. No. No hospitals. No way.
-Do you wanna keep your dick or not?

30:26.117 --> 30:28.574
Bill, haven't seen you in a while.

30:29.245 --> 30:32.578
-|'m mainstreaming.
-Good for you. Who's the doll?

30:32.748 --> 30:36.536
-Pam, this is Sookie. Sookie, this is Pam.
-Pleased to meet you.

30:38.921 --> 30:42.789
-Can I see your ID?
-Oh. Sure.

30:42.967 --> 30:46.676
How funny. Who'd have thought?
Getting carded at a vampire bar.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.216
I can no longer tell human ages.

30:50.391 --> 30:54.680
We must be careful we serve no minors,
in any capacity.

30:57.565 --> 31:02.184
Twenty-five, huh? How sweet it is.

31:07.616 --> 31:10.449
Oh, I don't know. Is there a large?

31:11.037 --> 31:14.200
This feels a little bit like
what vampire bar would look like...

31:14.373 --> 31:17.115
...if it were a-- A ride at Disney World.

31:17.293 --> 31:18.954
Well, don't get too comfortable.

31:19.128 --> 31:22.461
It tends to get more authentic
as the night wears on.

31:26.802 --> 31:29.293
Can I get you something to drink?

31:30.306 --> 31:31.796
Please.

31:37.146 --> 31:38.431
How's it going, Bill?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.482
-Hey.
-Hey, darling.

31:40.649 --> 31:41.684
Very well.

31:41.859 --> 31:45.977
-|'|| say it is. This your meal for tonight?
-This is my friend Sookie.

31:46.155 --> 31:48.441
-Sookie, Longshadow.
-Nice to meet you.

31:51.452 --> 31:56.162
-|'|| have a gin and tonic, please.
-And I'll have a bottle of O-negative.

31:59.710 --> 32:01.325
Sookie here, would like to know...

32:01.504 --> 32:04.541
...if she could ask you a few questions.
Would this be acceptable?

32:04.715 --> 32:08.674
I just have a couple of pictures
I'd love you to take a look at.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.835
Do you recognize either of these women?

32:11.013 --> 32:13.004
Yeah, I've seen them both here before.

32:13.182 --> 32:16.845
Great, thank you. Do you also happen
to remember who they hung around with?

32:17.353 --> 32:21.187
That's something we don't notice here.
You won't either.

32:21.690 --> 32:25.979
Okay, then. Thank you.
I appreciate you taking the time.

32:27.196 --> 32:30.359
This one, she wanted to die.

32:32.785 --> 32:33.820
How do you know?

32:33.994 --> 32:38.158
Everyone who comes here does,
in their own way.

32:38.332 --> 32:40.493
That's who we are: Death.

33:02.273 --> 33:04.730
Oh, my God. He ’3 so powerful.
So beautiful.

33:04.900 --> 33:07.107
The closer I step,
the more beautiful he gets.

33:07.278 --> 33:11.521
You can do this. Just walk up there
and offer yourself to him--

33:12.867 --> 33:14.232
How's your drink?

33:14.410 --> 33:18.653
A gin and tonic's pretty much a
gin and tonic, no matter where you drink it.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.662
I know exactly what you mean.

33:28.924 --> 33:30.585
Who's that?

33:30.968 --> 33:32.833
Oh, you noticed him, did you?

33:33.012 --> 33:36.254
-No, it's not like that. ljust--
-Everyone does.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.840
That's Eric.

33:39.685 --> 33:42.427
He's the oldest thing in this bar.

33:52.948 --> 33:53.937
Hi.

33:56.285 --> 33:57.866
I'm Taryn.

34:01.790 --> 34:03.621
Still think you're in Disney World?

34:09.465 --> 34:12.502
You say that this has never happened
to you before?

34:12.676 --> 34:14.416
No, sir.

34:15.387 --> 34:18.379
Well, no sign of hypertension.

34:20.309 --> 34:24.473
I'm gonna ask a question, son, and
I'm gonna need you to be honest with me.

34:24.647 --> 34:26.478
Have you taken any drugs today?

34:29.026 --> 34:31.813
No. No, that's a negative.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.147
So no marijuana, then?

34:34.198 --> 34:36.063
How about cocaine?

34:36.242 --> 34:37.903
-Meth?
-No.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.739
-Vampire blood?
-What?

34:40.913 --> 34:44.201
Hell, that's sick.
I mean, to even suggest that is--

34:44.375 --> 34:47.492
Yeah, yeah,
you'd never do anything like that.

34:47.670 --> 34:51.458
All right. Let's have a look.

34:52.800 --> 34:56.509
Oh, boy. Sure glad I'm not you.

34:58.806 --> 35:00.671
It looks kind of like an eggplant...

35:00.849 --> 35:04.558
...what with that color
and the way it's all swollen up at the end.

35:05.312 --> 35:06.472
Can you fix it?

35:06.647 --> 35:08.683
Ordinarily we like to treat this in stages.

35:08.857 --> 35:13.191
First, and least radical, being an injection
of anti-inflammatory drugs into the penis.

35:16.031 --> 35:20.525
A needle in my dick?
That's the least radical thing you can do?

35:20.703 --> 35:22.944
It is, yes.
But you've progressed to the point...

35:23.122 --> 35:25.704
...where I don't think you'd benefit
from that at all.

35:25.874 --> 35:27.705
In my opinion, we need to aspirate.

35:29.378 --> 35:31.869
I need to drain the blood
out of your penis.

35:39.263 --> 35:42.050
Okay, I'll leave you to it.

35:43.392 --> 35:44.882
Where are you going?

35:45.060 --> 35:48.598
Look, I will admit to sometimes
having a sick curiosity about medical shit...

35:48.772 --> 35:50.728
...but I ain't that fucking curious.

35:52.735 --> 35:55.397
Tara, stay with me?

35:57.948 --> 36:00.940
I ain't never gonna be the same
after this.

36:01.118 --> 36:03.734
-You're not?
-Are you ready, son?

36:05.164 --> 36:06.745
Ain't you gonna put me out?

36:06.915 --> 36:09.907
I don't think we can afford the time
it would take to sedate you.

36:10.085 --> 36:12.576
Without knowing
what other substances you've taken...

36:12.755 --> 36:16.418
...I don't wanna risk a drug interaction.
Now, just lean on back there for me.

36:17.009 --> 36:18.294
There you go.

36:18.469 --> 36:21.176
-Tara?
-It's-- It's gonna be okay.

36:21.347 --> 36:23.258
You gotta breathe, though.

36:27.061 --> 36:32.681
All right, then.
You're gonna feel a stick in three, two--

36:48.832 --> 36:50.572
Sam?

36:50.751 --> 36:54.460
I hate to ask, but would you mind
walking me to my car tonight?

36:54.922 --> 36:56.412
No problem.

36:56.590 --> 37:02.005
Arlene, don't hate to ask.
Not with what's been going on.

37:02.179 --> 37:04.090
Well, I ain't never been with no vampire.

37:04.264 --> 37:09.804
But still, you know,
you can't be too safe, you know?

37:10.104 --> 37:13.437
-Get the lights for me, would you?
-Okay.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.445
It used to be, living in a small town
and knowing everybody in it...

37:25.619 --> 37:28.326
...you knew you were safe.
It's a new day now.

37:28.497 --> 37:30.408
Don't I know it.

37:33.085 --> 37:35.667
How come no one fucked me?
I got a dog collar too.

37:35.838 --> 37:38.671
Morticia, how'd you like me
to rip that tape off your tits?

37:38.841 --> 37:40.706
It ain't gay if a guy's a vampire, is it?

37:40.884 --> 37:43.751
I'm gonna get kicked out of my frat
ifl don 't fuck a vampire.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.466
You able to pick up anything?

37:46.723 --> 37:50.557
All anyone's thinking about here is
sex,sex,sex.

37:50.769 --> 37:54.102
One needn't be telepathic
to pick up on that.

38:05.701 --> 38:09.865
Don't say, "uh-oh."
Vampires are not supposed to say "uh-oh."

38:10.747 --> 38:13.739
It's Eric. He's scanned you twice.
He's going to summon us.

38:13.917 --> 38:17.034
-He can do that?
-Oh, yeah.

38:34.730 --> 38:38.063
Bill Compton. It has been a while.

38:38.484 --> 38:42.397
-Yes, well, I've been--
-Mainstreaming.

38:44.239 --> 38:45.228
I heard.

38:49.495 --> 38:52.487
I see that is going well for you.

38:52.664 --> 38:55.576
Yes, of course, sorry.
Eric, this is my friend--

38:55.751 --> 38:57.912
-Sookie Stackhouse.
-How do you know my name?

38:58.086 --> 39:01.499
I never forget a pretty face.
You're in my vault.

39:02.090 --> 39:05.628
Great. That's just great.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.338
It's nice to meet you.

39:07.513 --> 39:10.755
-Well, aren't you sweet.
-Not really.

39:18.899 --> 39:22.266
I understand you've been asking questions
about some of my customers.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.433
Yes, I have.

39:23.612 --> 39:26.570
If you have anything to ask,
you should ask it of me.

39:27.282 --> 39:29.068
Alrighty.

39:30.953 --> 39:32.784
You recognize either one of these girls?

39:41.255 --> 39:44.213
This one offered herself to me.

39:45.259 --> 39:47.796
But I found her too pathetic
for my attentions.

39:50.305 --> 39:52.591
Now, this one, however...

39:54.393 --> 39:56.429
...I have tasted.

39:58.146 --> 40:01.229
-I remember them both.
-On account of the vault?

40:03.485 --> 40:06.477
Never had either of them, though.
They weren't really my type.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.865
Well, thank you very much.
That is all your time I need to take.

40:12.035 --> 40:14.412
I'm not finished with you yet.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.204
Please...

40:18.834 --> 40:20.074
...sit.

40:26.592 --> 40:29.925
80, Bill...

40:30.220 --> 40:33.007
...are you quite attached to your friend?

40:33.181 --> 40:34.512
She is mine.

40:34.683 --> 40:37.675
Yes. I am his.

40:37.853 --> 40:41.345
Well, what a pity for me.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.354
Sit with us.

40:47.362 --> 40:52.527
We have catching up to do, you and I.
It has been too long.

40:53.619 --> 40:55.325
Yes.

41:01.710 --> 41:05.123
Where the fuck are they? My backup
was supposed to be here 15 minutes ago.

41:05.297 --> 41:08.039
I can't handle a raid on my own.
These fucking vampires--

41:08.216 --> 41:09.672
We have to get out of here.

41:09.843 --> 41:12.300
-SooMe.
-Cops are coming. There's gonna be a raid.

41:12.512 --> 41:15.970
-Tell me you're not an undercover cop.
-|'m not but that man in the hat is.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.552
Even if you're right,
we do nothing illegal here.

41:18.769 --> 41:22.227
Go ahead and do it. Open me up.
I don’t care, make me feel something.

41:22.397 --> 41:25.730
There's a vampire in the ladies' room
with that man you kicked before.

41:25.901 --> 41:28.563
-She's feeding on him.
-How do you know this?

41:29.404 --> 41:31.736
Police! Police!

41:31.907 --> 41:34.569
-Freeze!
-Don't move!

41:34.743 --> 41:35.903
Follow me.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.492
Hands where I can see them.

41:41.750 --> 41:45.743
I enjoyed meeting you, Miss Stackhouse.
You will come again.

41:55.347 --> 41:57.008
Tara.

41:58.600 --> 41:59.589
Tara.

42:02.771 --> 42:04.227
Tara.

42:04.398 --> 42:07.606
-SooMe.
-You get your ugly self down here.

42:08.110 --> 42:12.023
-Hey, Tara. Sookie ain't home.
-No, just please let me in, okay?

42:12.197 --> 42:14.529
-|'m gonna crack you one--
-Don't let her in.

42:14.700 --> 42:16.110
Is there a problem here?

42:16.284 --> 42:18.366
You bet your tiny white ass
there's a problem.

42:18.537 --> 42:22.371
-Little bitch hid my Captain Morgan.
-I didn't hide it, Mom. I threw it out.

42:22.541 --> 42:24.827
-Don't.
-Look, my Gran's at the market...

42:25.001 --> 42:27.663
...and I ain't supposed to let anyone in
while she's gone.

42:27.838 --> 42:30.454
-You let her in.
-Well, I know her.

42:30.632 --> 42:31.667
Mama, let him go.

42:31.842 --> 42:35.881
Maybe I should call Sheriff Dearborne, so
he can come out here and throw you in jail.

42:36.054 --> 42:39.467
Where I guarantee ain't no Captain Morgan
gonna be waiting for you.

42:46.273 --> 42:47.888
This ain't over.

43:04.458 --> 43:05.743
Can we turn this down?

43:09.463 --> 43:11.670
What language are they speaking,
anyhow?

43:11.840 --> 43:13.671
Cambodian.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.879
You don't like it?

43:18.388 --> 43:23.178
You think we can pull over for a minute?
I need things to stop.

43:24.728 --> 43:26.514
Sure.

43:40.327 --> 43:42.943
I just need a couple minutes of quiet
and then we can go.

43:43.121 --> 43:46.238
Well, I'm in no hurry. You take your time.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.292
I'm sorry if I got you
into any trouble tonight.

43:51.463 --> 43:57.174
Don't apologize. We vampires
are always in some kind of trouble.

43:59.721 --> 44:02.679
And I'd prefer to be in it with you.

44:12.359 --> 44:14.896
Oh, this can't be happening.

44:23.954 --> 44:24.989
Open up.

44:25.163 --> 44:28.200
Open the window
and let me do the talking, okay?

44:31.503 --> 44:34.085
-Hello, officer.
-Evening, miss.

44:35.549 --> 44:39.633
-What are you two doing out this late?
-Driving home from a date.

44:40.387 --> 44:44.596
We were raiding a bar not too far from here.
Y'all coming from there by any chance?

44:44.766 --> 44:46.927
No. Not us.

44:49.145 --> 44:52.512
It's called Fangtasia. That ring any bells?

44:53.316 --> 44:57.605
How about you, son?
You seem awful quiet.

44:57.863 --> 44:59.774
Don't you talk?

45:01.116 --> 45:03.983
I'm a man of few words.

45:04.160 --> 45:07.744
"A man of few words." I like that.

45:09.541 --> 45:12.283
Let me just shine this light here
on your neck, miss...

45:12.460 --> 45:14.291
...if you don't mind.

45:18.884 --> 45:21.125
Not at all.

45:24.389 --> 45:27.176
Why don't you ask her
if you can shine it between her legs?

45:27.350 --> 45:29.887
-Excuse me.
-Bi|l.

45:30.896 --> 45:35.139
Vampires sometimes like to feed
from the femoral artery.

45:35.317 --> 45:39.026
The blood flows more freely down there...

45:39.195 --> 45:42.653
...so one doesn't have to suck as hard.

45:44.159 --> 45:45.239
Or so I've been told.

45:55.128 --> 45:58.962
I like your gun. It's a beautiful weapon.

46:00.216 --> 46:02.172
Thank you.

46:04.346 --> 46:06.962
-May I have it?
-Bi|l, I want you to stop this right now.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.676
Sure.

46:09.184 --> 46:11.095
lguess.

46:13.688 --> 46:15.519
Nice.

46:16.441 --> 46:18.853
It's heavierthan I imagined.

46:19.861 --> 46:24.446
-Is it loaded?
-Well, yes. Yes, it is.

46:24.616 --> 46:28.200
-Yeah.
-Bi|l, you are freaking me out.

46:29.871 --> 46:32.112
Now, you listen to me, officer.

46:33.166 --> 46:38.286
I do not take kindly to you shining your light
in the eyes of my female companion.

46:40.298 --> 46:46.385
And as I have more than 100 years on you,
I do not take kindly to you calling me "son."

46:47.263 --> 46:51.723
So the next time you pull somebody over
on suspicion of being a vampire...

46:52.894 --> 46:55.476
...you better pray to God
that you're wrong.

46:57.399 --> 47:01.642
Because that vampire may not be
as kind to you as I'm about to be.

47:04.280 --> 47:06.657
I'm not gonna kill you.

47:08.076 --> 47:10.658
But I am gonna keep your gun.

47:12.205 --> 47:13.365
Does that sound fair?

47:13.540 --> 47:15.246
-Yes.
-Yes, what?

47:15.417 --> 47:16.702
Yes, sir.

47:17.877 --> 47:19.742
There you go.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.914
Now, you have a nice night.
