[theme music playing]

00:29.237 --> 00:31.156
[Ani] <i>Do innocent people run?</i>

00:32.615 --> 00:33.615
<i>They do,</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:35.452
<i>if that's their only choice.</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:38.830
[Caleb, whispering] No fucking way
are you driving to Mexico today.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.665
And you're definitely not taking Clay.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.935
[Tony] He can stay at my family's
till things cool down.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.240
- [Caleb] You didn't do anything.
- [Tony] Neither did he!

00:45.503 --> 00:46.503
[Caleb] Tony!

00:50.383 --> 00:53.720
You've got to start thinking
of yourself, Tony. Of your future.

00:53.803 --> 00:55.243
That's exactly what I'm thinking of.

00:55.930 --> 00:58.808
[Caleb] You let that kid drag you down.
You've done it before.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.351
He's my friend!

01:01.102 --> 01:02.228
And he needs me.

01:02.312 --> 01:03.146
[Caleb] I need you!

01:03.229 --> 01:05.829
[Tony] You're not the one who's wanted
for a murder you didn't do.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.734
How do you know he didn't do it?

01:23.541 --> 01:26.002
[Mrs. Jensen]
<i>Do you have any idea where Clay is?</i>

01:27.837 --> 01:28.880
I have no clue.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.216
When I came home last night,
he wasn't there.

01:31.299 --> 01:32.467
And what time was that?

01:33.384 --> 01:34.384
Around midnight.

01:34.761 --> 01:37.472
When I woke up this morning,
his bed was still made.

01:37.555 --> 01:40.225
I tried calling his phone,
but then I remembered the cops took it.

01:40.308 --> 01:42.560
And he gave you no indication
that he intended to flee?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.730
- No warning at all.
- Well, can you blame him?

01:45.855 --> 01:49.025
The police just kicked down our door,
for Christ's sake. He's scared shitless.

01:49.109 --> 01:52.695
Justin, I know that you and Clay protect
each other, but if there's something

01:52.779 --> 01:54.989
- you're not telling us...
- I don't know anything.

01:55.573 --> 01:56.574
I swear. I...

01:58.451 --> 02:00.203
He clearly didn't want me to know.

02:01.246 --> 02:03.331
[Ani] <i> Justin was as good as his word.</i>

02:03.706 --> 02:07.544
He would defend Clay until the end.
Which was going to get complicated.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.755
[Standall] Or Clay would defend Justin.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.340
Or Tyler Down.

02:12.423 --> 02:15.135
Or Jessica Davis. Or Zach Dempsey.

02:16.553 --> 02:19.139
[Ani] <i>As a fugitive,
Clay had one weakness.</i>

02:19.764 --> 02:21.349
<i>He cared about other people.</i>

02:24.894 --> 02:25.728
Hey.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.730
Clay, what are you doing here?

02:27.814 --> 02:29.399
I came to say goodbye. I'm...

02:30.316 --> 02:32.152
I'm leaving.
I don't think I'm coming back.

02:32.819 --> 02:33.987
But that's crazy.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.923
- They'll find you.
- If I stay here,

02:35.947 --> 02:37.147
it's not gonna get any better.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.033
Think it through.
There's going to be a trial.

02:39.117 --> 02:42.138
- Your lawyers will find things we missed.
- The cops have made up their minds.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.622
- So, we'll unmake them.
- [scoffs] How will we do that?

02:45.999 --> 02:46.999
I'll...

02:47.709 --> 02:48.709
I'll be your alibi.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.005
I'll say that I was with you
and that I didn't come forward before

02:52.088 --> 02:54.465
'cause of my mum,
and that you and I were together.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.209
And that we kept it a secret.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.512
Look, I'm not gonna point at Tony
or Justin or anyone else. I'm...

02:59.971 --> 03:02.599
- And I'm sure not gonna let you do that.
- Clay, you have to.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.100
I gotta go.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.895
- Clay, please.
- Look, I love that you want to help me,

03:07.228 --> 03:09.748
but you will get found out somehow
and you'll be in big trouble.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.823
And I know your mom's
not speaking to you now,

03:11.858 --> 03:14.319
but you're all she has
and you can't do that to her.

03:18.698 --> 03:19.532
I really gotta go.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.616
Clay...

03:39.010 --> 03:40.011
This isn't over.

03:48.519 --> 03:49.604
[speaking in Swahili]

03:50.980 --> 03:52.440
[speaking in Swahili]

04:11.167 --> 04:12.168
He what?

04:12.919 --> 04:16.547
Holy shit! Justin... [stammering] Wait.
So, he's just gone?

04:18.925 --> 04:21.010
Yeah, if I see him, I'll call you,
but I...

04:21.803 --> 04:23.388
Okay, yeah. Okay.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.682
[Monty] Was that Justy?

04:25.765 --> 04:27.868
He have an excuse
why he skipped weights this morning?

04:27.892 --> 04:30.353
- Yeah, family stuff.
- [scoffs] He doesn't have a family.

04:30.853 --> 04:33.481
Wait, who's gone? Jensen?
What the fuck? Did he take off?

04:34.190 --> 04:35.608
What? Why would he do that?

04:35.817 --> 04:37.485
Holy fuck, maybe he <i>is </i> guilty!

04:37.568 --> 04:40.571
He's not guilty, that's insane.
There's no way he could've taken on Bryce.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.865
You know what?
That would've taken someone who was,

04:42.949 --> 04:47.662
I don't know, six foot, one-ninety,
nasty fucking temper.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.748
Sounds like someone
I wouldn't want to fuck with.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.754
Come on, Charlie.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.562
[cell vibrating]

05:13.938 --> 05:16.482
- Uh, hello?
<i>- Hey, Tyler. It's Clay.</i>

05:17.817 --> 05:20.820
I wanted to let you know I can't drive
you home today. I won't be at school.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.195
[Tyler] <i>Oh,</i>

05:22.530 --> 05:23.740
<i>you won't be at school?</i>

05:23.948 --> 05:25.533
[Clay sighing] Yeah.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.829
So, maybe you can hitch a ride
with Alex or someone?

05:30.413 --> 05:31.413
Okay, um...

05:31.831 --> 05:34.709
but I mean, I was really hoping
you'd be here today.

05:34.792 --> 05:36.127
<i>There's this assembly.</i>

05:36.336 --> 05:37.337
Yeah, I just...

05:39.464 --> 05:40.798
I can't, man. Okay?

05:41.799 --> 05:42.800
Yeah, okay.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.763
<i>You're gonna be all right, yeah?</i>

05:47.680 --> 05:48.680
Yeah.

05:49.098 --> 05:50.098
I just...

05:50.683 --> 05:52.393
<i>I was really hoping you'd be here.</i>

05:53.353 --> 05:54.562
<i>Today of all days.</i>

05:54.979 --> 05:55.979
Why me?

05:56.773 --> 05:58.399
<i>What do you mean "of all days?"</i>

05:58.900 --> 06:00.276
Because I needed a friend.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.360
[car horn blowing]

06:05.073 --> 06:06.073
Tyler...

06:06.824 --> 06:07.824
ah... [sighing]

06:08.576 --> 06:11.329
Listen, I gotta run, but I'll try, okay?

06:15.291 --> 06:21.255
Welcome, everyone. And a very special
welcome to our guests from Hillcrest.

06:22.340 --> 06:24.342
We would like this to be a time...

06:25.176 --> 06:26.386
to come together.

06:27.261 --> 06:29.430
The interruption of our Homecoming game

06:30.014 --> 06:33.184
inflamed feelings on all sides.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.728
And it was followed a few days later...

06:36.646 --> 06:38.731
by the news of the tragic death

06:38.815 --> 06:42.026
of a former Liberty
and recent Hillcrest student,

06:42.110 --> 06:43.152
Bryce Walker.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.987
Now, I've spoken at length

06:45.071 --> 06:49.784
with the student leadership,
and Hillcrest administrators.

06:50.284 --> 06:53.746
We agreed that it was time
to bring our schools together

06:54.789 --> 06:56.833
for a day of accountability and healing.

06:57.375 --> 06:58.668
And with that in mind...

06:59.710 --> 07:00.711
Jessica Davis,

07:01.212 --> 07:04.632
student body president
and organizer of the protest,

07:05.466 --> 07:06.968
would like to offer a few words.

07:07.760 --> 07:09.095
[applause]

07:13.015 --> 07:15.643
Thank you, Principal Bolan.
You're absolutely right

07:15.977 --> 07:17.478
that at times like these,

07:17.854 --> 07:20.690
people need to be held accountable
for their mistakes.

07:20.982 --> 07:25.069
And after something traumatic happens,
it's important to focus on healing.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.865
But the thing is...

07:30.575 --> 07:32.743
how is anybody supposed to heal

07:32.827 --> 07:36.330
if all we do is cover up the wounds
and hope that they'll go away?

07:41.002 --> 07:44.964
We have to look at them
and recognize them for what they are.

07:46.591 --> 07:47.842
We have to be honest

07:47.925 --> 07:50.720
about who actually got hurt and how.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.811
The protest I led was an attempt

07:58.895 --> 08:02.231
to try to draw attention
to the rape culture in boys' sports

08:02.690 --> 08:04.233
and throughout our school.

08:04.525 --> 08:05.525
And yes,

08:05.985 --> 08:09.071
I admit that
the way I went about it wasn't perfect.

08:10.239 --> 08:12.909
I'm sorry for how it all ended up.
I really am.

08:13.951 --> 08:17.914
But making mistakes is part
of being a survivor.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.958
At first, you think you're, like...

08:21.918 --> 08:23.044
permanently broken.

08:24.712 --> 08:25.712
But then...

08:27.340 --> 08:28.424
little by little,

08:29.008 --> 08:30.843
you start picking up the pieces

08:30.927 --> 08:34.722
and you start realizing
what you're making is a mirror.

08:35.306 --> 08:36.306
And...

08:36.682 --> 08:38.683
the more of those pieces
that you put together,

08:38.768 --> 08:41.187
the more you start to see yourself.

08:43.688 --> 08:44.524
But maybe

08:44.607 --> 08:47.985
we can start picking up those pieces
of that mirror together,

08:48.069 --> 08:50.655
and we can finally see the truth.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.493
If you think sexual assault
doesn't affect your life, you're wrong.

08:56.285 --> 08:59.580
There are survivors all around us.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.500
People you care about...

09:03.751 --> 09:06.879
who you never knew
were suffering in silence.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.925
Let them know that you're there to listen.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.136
It's time for you to know

09:14.845 --> 09:16.472
the survivors in your life.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.976
To hear their stories
and to know that their voice matters.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.065
My name is Jessica Davis,

09:27.275 --> 09:28.442
and I'm a survivor.

09:29.735 --> 09:31.195
[crowd whispering]

09:33.281 --> 09:35.825
My name is Casey Ford,
and I'm a survivor.

09:38.035 --> 09:39.745
[Ani] <i>Jessica was fearless.</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:43.791
My name is Janelle Martin,
and I'm a survivor.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.881
[Ani] <i>And her courage spread.</i>

09:50.965 --> 09:52.216
My name is Maggie Kim,

09:52.300 --> 09:53.426
and I'm a survivor.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.028
[girl gasps]

10:13.321 --> 10:14.739
[shakily] My name is Tyler Down...

10:16.532 --> 10:17.658
and I'm a survivor.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.705
[crowd murmuring]

10:26.500 --> 10:27.710
My name is Lina Ochoa,

10:28.919 --> 10:30.087
and I'm a survivor.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.465
[Ani] <i>It went beyond her group.</i>

10:32.590 --> 10:33.966
My name is Sarah Stern.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.177
I'm a survivor.

10:41.223 --> 10:42.516
My name is Robby Corman...

10:44.727 --> 10:45.811
and I'm a survivor.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.276
My name is Tanya Brown.

10:53.152 --> 10:54.153
I'm a survivor.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.454
My name is Justin Foley...

11:07.875 --> 11:08.918
and I'm a survivor.

11:16.550 --> 11:20.596
My name is Stephanie Rodriguez,
and I am a goddamn survivor.

11:20.971 --> 11:21.971
[girl] Yeah!

11:22.973 --> 11:25.434
[scattered applause]

11:28.688 --> 11:30.981
[Ani] <i>Jessica was totally fearless
that day.</i>

11:32.108 --> 11:35.319
<i>She acted like someone who didn't care
about the cost of courage.</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:37.863
To those of you who are still seated,

11:38.739 --> 11:42.284
I know a lot of you still have stories,
but you're not ready to share them yet.

11:42.368 --> 11:43.953
And that's okay.

11:44.578 --> 11:46.205
When you're ready, we'll listen.

11:46.747 --> 11:50.334
And we will continue to fight
to make sure that no one

11:50.418 --> 11:54.171
is assaulted, harassed or abused
at this school.

11:55.464 --> 11:58.092
We will not sit down.
We will not be quiet.

11:58.175 --> 12:00.594
We will not rest until that happens.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.560
Yeah!

12:11.814 --> 12:14.066
- [cheering]
- [indistinct shouting]

12:21.866 --> 12:23.951
[cheering]

12:29.540 --> 12:31.709
- [Jessica] I'm so proud of you!
- [Tyler] Thank you.

12:32.376 --> 12:34.086
Hey, Jessica. Can I talk to you?

12:34.253 --> 12:35.963
- See you.
- [Tyler] Yeah, see you.

12:37.339 --> 12:38.339
[Robby] Um...

12:38.424 --> 12:40.968
- hey, it's Tyler, right?
- Yeah, hey.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.763
Um... nice to meet you, Robby.

12:44.054 --> 12:46.182
Thank you for being the first.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.226
[stammering]
I mean... first guy to stand up.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.103
Yeah. I mean...

12:52.021 --> 12:53.021
for sure.

12:53.230 --> 12:55.441
Do you think I could be a part
of HO, too?

12:56.192 --> 12:58.068
Is that... allowed?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.361
Fuck, yeah!

12:59.779 --> 13:02.239
It's more than allowed.
Everybody's welcome at HO.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.532
Fucking everybody!

13:04.033 --> 13:06.994
Even if some people were dicks to them
in the beginning.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.705
Some people are sorry.

13:14.877 --> 13:15.753
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:15.836 --> 13:17.338
That was... incredible.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.672
You were incredible.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.050
Thank you. I was so freaked out, but...

13:21.801 --> 13:23.427
I'm so happy I did it.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.055
Seeing all those people stand up,
it was...

13:26.138 --> 13:28.098
I loved that bit in your speech
about the mirror.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.559
Is that from something, or...

13:31.060 --> 13:32.228
Why, what do you mean?

13:33.229 --> 13:36.023
Well, nothing, it was just...
It was really beautiful.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.944
And I was just wondering
if it was... something you'd heard before,

13:40.820 --> 13:42.154
or if it just came to you?

13:42.238 --> 13:44.698
I don't know.
I guess it just kind of came to me.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.662
- I should...
- Yeah, of course. Congrats.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.745
Thanks.

13:52.873 --> 13:56.377
[Ani] <i>I guess I wondered where
that fearlessness might have come from.</i>

13:57.503 --> 14:00.339
I just, uh, I wanted to ask
if you were okay?

14:00.881 --> 14:02.049
If you needed anything?

14:02.883 --> 14:05.469
No, man. I'm good at the moment.
But thank you.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.639
What happened to me
didn't... didn't happen today.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.266
No. I mean, I know.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.724
Um...

14:12.059 --> 14:13.060
yeah, listen...

14:14.061 --> 14:15.145
I'm sorry, man.

14:15.896 --> 14:17.940
And I think...

14:18.607 --> 14:19.775
I think you're awesome.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.654
Yeah, Charlie. Thank you.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.033
- Shit. I gotta go.
- Yeah.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.244
Hey.

14:32.288 --> 14:33.414
You made it.

14:34.331 --> 14:37.418
Tyler, listen, man.
I gotta take off. But, um...

14:40.296 --> 14:41.589
I'm so proud of you.

14:41.672 --> 14:42.672
Yeah?

14:43.465 --> 14:44.592
Thank you.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.867
Clay, where the fuck have you been?

14:47.177 --> 14:48.012
I have to go.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.848
- Are you fucking crazy? You can't run.
- [Jessica] Justin.

14:51.473 --> 14:52.600
Was that real just then?

14:52.683 --> 14:54.268
- Yes. Yeah...
- [Sheriff] Clay Jensen!

14:55.978 --> 14:56.978
[door closing]

14:59.648 --> 15:00.649
[Sheriff] Clay Jensen,

15:01.358 --> 15:03.903
I have a warrant for your arrest
for the murder of Bryce Walker.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.246
Turn around.
Put your hands behind your back.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.491
Clay! I...

15:10.034 --> 15:11.474
You have the right to remain silent.

15:11.535 --> 15:14.788
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.750
You have the right to an attorney.
If you cannot afford one,

15:18.334 --> 15:20.628
one will be appointed to you
by the court.

15:21.211 --> 15:22.211
Let's go.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.597
[Ani] <i>The Sheriff was convinced
he had his man.</i>

15:34.433 --> 15:35.643
But you weren't so sure.

15:36.477 --> 15:37.477
[Standall] No.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.649
[chatter]

15:41.982 --> 15:43.901
[Mrs. Walker]
So, why don't you give that a try?

15:43.984 --> 15:44.984
[woman] Okay.

15:45.319 --> 15:48.030
Yeah, I think you'd enjoy it.
Okay. Thanks.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.113
[woman] Okay.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.907
Deputy.

15:51.533 --> 15:53.202
- Good morning.
- Morning, ma'am.

15:54.370 --> 15:55.204
Is there news?

15:55.287 --> 15:57.414
Well, the Sheriff is close
to having a case

15:57.498 --> 16:00.000
he feels he can turn over
to the county prosecutor.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.962
But there's just a few things I'd like
to confirm with you, if I may?

16:03.253 --> 16:04.463
Of course.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.006
Do you have any reason to believe

16:06.090 --> 16:08.300
that Clay would purchase steroids
from your son?

16:08.884 --> 16:09.885
I, um...

16:10.970 --> 16:12.137
Not that I can recall.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.598
But Clay did purchase marijuana
from Bryce once?

16:15.683 --> 16:17.559
I think that was just a pretense.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.521
To get into our home. To entrap Bryce.

16:20.604 --> 16:24.483
Okay, other than that
and the incident in the driveway,

16:24.566 --> 16:27.987
did Bryce ever spend any time with Clay
that you can remember?

16:29.905 --> 16:30.948
Not that I knew of.

16:31.740 --> 16:33.450
They weren't friends, of course.

16:33.534 --> 16:36.745
Well, who did Bryce spend time with
in that time after he left Liberty?

16:37.579 --> 16:38.579
Well, um...

16:39.748 --> 16:40.833
Montgomery de la Cruz

16:40.916 --> 16:43.544
was over a number of times last summer,
and...

16:45.796 --> 16:46.922
your son.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.966
They seemed close for a while.

16:49.591 --> 16:50.591
Uh-huh.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.678
Yeah, I knew
they spent some time together.

16:52.761 --> 16:53.761
But...

16:55.305 --> 16:59.601
Bryce really didn't have any friends left
these past months.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.896
All he had was me, really.

17:06.567 --> 17:09.444
[Mrs. Walker] <i>Press down
through that left big toe mound.</i>

17:09.528 --> 17:12.448
Roll the chest open. Exhale. That's it.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.700
Shoot that tailbone
towards your right heel.

17:14.782 --> 17:16.910
Beautiful. How's that feel? Breathe.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.289
Good. Come on down.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.374
Does that feel better?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.751
- Good. Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:26.502 --> 17:27.628
Good class, Teach.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.423
[sighs]

17:29.548 --> 17:32.092
Teacher-in-training.
I'm still finishing my hours.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.969
Still, that's some tough-looking shit.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.137
Stuff.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.640
Sorry. Sacred space.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.184
Not sacred, but...

17:41.393 --> 17:42.393
spiritual, I hope.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.646
[chuckles]

17:44.897 --> 17:46.023
Don't laugh!

17:46.106 --> 17:47.191
No, I'm not. I'm not.

17:47.858 --> 17:49.943
It's really cool
this is all working out for you.

17:50.027 --> 17:52.488
- You're injured?
- No, I'm just tight.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.364
Practice was nuts yesterday.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.868
Now I've got nerves on top of it.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.329
- Tonight's the Liberty game?
- Yeah.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.999
You know, I can help with all that.
The muscles,

18:04.083 --> 18:05.876
- the nerves.
- No, that's okay, Mom.

18:06.460 --> 18:08.378
What, you're not man enough for yoga?

18:12.841 --> 18:13.675
[Mrs. Walker] Ready?

18:13.759 --> 18:15.844
Now you're going to move
into downward facing dog.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.304
[Bryce laughing]

18:17.679 --> 18:19.598
Laughter is good, just keep breathing.

18:19.807 --> 18:22.017
[laughing] It's just the names!

18:22.392 --> 18:25.312
The names are descriptive,
but they also have meaning.

18:26.063 --> 18:28.690
English is easier than the Sanskrit,
believe me.

18:29.441 --> 18:30.943
Lift your hips up and back.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.988
Stretch your heels to the floor.
Lift your sit-bones.

18:35.906 --> 18:37.746
Your hamstrings are too tight.
Bend your knees.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.543
It's more important
to have a straight spine.

18:41.537 --> 18:45.165
Breathe. Every breath takes you deeper
into the pose.

18:45.249 --> 18:46.583
[Bryce breathing deeply]

18:46.959 --> 18:49.419
Okay, good.
Now we're going to move into pigeon.

18:50.546 --> 18:52.881
- Sorry. [chuckling]
- It's all right.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.301
On an inhale,
raise your right leg up and back.

18:56.802 --> 18:57.636
Okay.

18:57.719 --> 19:01.473
As you exhale, right knee to right wrist.
Lay your shin down.

19:03.725 --> 19:06.895
Good. Slide that foot forward.
But protect your knee.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.231
Stretch your left leg back.

19:09.690 --> 19:11.066
Square your hips.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.362
Good.
Take a deep breath in, lift your heart.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.530
[both inhaling]

19:16.738 --> 19:19.908
As you exhale,
see if you can lengthen out over that leg.

19:21.743 --> 19:22.953
Do that a couple times.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.247
[groaning]

19:27.583 --> 19:29.168
Good. This opens up your hips.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.628
Uh...

19:32.004 --> 19:33.922
- [grunting] this is hard.
- Okay.

19:34.381 --> 19:37.467
It's important to go slow
and respect the body's boundaries.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.553
Wait till the body gives you permission

19:39.636 --> 19:41.096
to go deeper, don't force.

19:41.430 --> 19:42.514
[exhaling]

19:44.975 --> 19:45.975
Good.

19:54.943 --> 19:55.986
[Mrs. Walker] Good.

20:06.330 --> 20:08.582
[sobbing]

20:11.210 --> 20:12.711
You're shaking. Does it hurt?

20:14.379 --> 20:16.006
Inhale. Lift your torso.

20:18.217 --> 20:19.301
Oh, Bryce.

20:21.511 --> 20:22.512
I don't know what...

20:23.263 --> 20:25.891
I don't know what's happening,
I just started crying.

20:25.974 --> 20:28.268
It's okay. It's good. It's okay.

20:29.436 --> 20:32.272
- I don't know why I can't stop.
- It's okay.

20:35.859 --> 20:37.361
[sobbing]

20:38.028 --> 20:39.071
[whimpering]

20:56.213 --> 20:57.214
They aren't mine.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.512
Do I look like the kind of kid
who uses steroids?

21:02.552 --> 21:04.304
Why hide them in your drawer, then?

21:06.723 --> 21:07.724
I was holding them.

21:10.018 --> 21:11.061
For a friend.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.478
What friend?

21:14.815 --> 21:16.566
This friend buy them from Bryce?

21:19.361 --> 21:22.281
He said he got them from some dealer
at City Gym.

21:27.953 --> 21:28.953
Want something to drink?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.010
All right.
Sheriff will be here in a minute.

21:36.378 --> 21:39.256
[Ani] <i>Clay's arrest
and the assembly where it happened,</i>

21:40.090 --> 21:41.967
<i>it was about to change everything.</i>

21:42.759 --> 21:44.094
Everybody's staring at me.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.555
Fuck, yeah, they are. You're a rock star.

21:48.682 --> 21:51.351
- Tyler...
- What do you want?

21:51.935 --> 21:54.646
I just, uh... Can I talk to Tyler alone
for a minute?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.315
- No.
- Please?

21:57.065 --> 21:59.693
- I need to tell him something.
- Hey, it's cool, you guys.

21:59.776 --> 22:01.376
- I'll meet up with you at lunch.
- Okay.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.403
Okay.

22:02.779 --> 22:03.989
We're so proud of you.

22:12.497 --> 22:13.497
What is it?

22:13.999 --> 22:15.000
Can we talk?

22:16.335 --> 22:17.335
Somewhere private?

22:18.754 --> 22:19.754
No.

22:20.339 --> 22:21.506
We can... we can talk here.

22:23.550 --> 22:24.550
Okay.

22:25.177 --> 22:26.177
Um...

22:27.387 --> 22:30.640
Monty.
I heard Monty say it, what he did to you.

22:31.558 --> 22:34.227
I mean, like, he admitted it
to me and Bryce.

22:34.811 --> 22:35.812
Like, all of it.

22:35.896 --> 22:36.896
Yeah?

22:37.230 --> 22:38.230
And, I'm...

22:38.940 --> 22:40.984
sorry that happened to you.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.194
I'm sorry.

22:44.404 --> 22:46.114
And I think Monty should pay for it,

22:46.198 --> 22:47.998
and I'll talk to the police
if you want me to.

22:48.992 --> 22:50.160
Why would you do this?

22:50.786 --> 22:52.037
I mean, you don't even like me.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.165
How can I not like you?
I mean, I barely know you.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.250
Yeah, but you've... heard stuff.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.795
Yeah. You've heard stuff about me, right?

23:00.170 --> 23:02.714
Like I'm an asshole jock or whatever.

23:02.798 --> 23:05.300
I mean, I guess so, yeah.

23:06.885 --> 23:07.885
So?

23:12.808 --> 23:13.808
[door closing]

23:14.309 --> 23:15.769
[coach] So, what's up?

23:18.105 --> 23:19.564
I have to resign as captain.

23:22.776 --> 23:23.776
Zach,

23:24.528 --> 23:26.154
just 'cause you're not on the field,

23:26.363 --> 23:29.116
that doesn't mean that you're not integral
to this team.

23:29.282 --> 23:31.284
I mean, look,
the way you led these guys,

23:31.827 --> 23:34.871
- it gives me hope for the future.
- That's the thing, Coach, is...

23:37.082 --> 23:38.083
I don't have a future.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.087
And I just need to accept that.

23:42.754 --> 23:44.339
Hey, don't quit on me. All right?

23:45.006 --> 23:47.134
Look, you still got a lot to offer.

23:47.217 --> 23:49.529
And if you stick around,
I'm sure you'll learn to see that.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.595
I've made up my mind.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.433
Thank you, Coach.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.602
For everything. You've been...

24:03.733 --> 24:05.485
This team, it means a lot to me.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.405
And it, it...

24:11.867 --> 24:12.867
It always will.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.496
Well, uh...

24:19.207 --> 24:20.792
[Zach] Bye, I guess.

24:21.084 --> 24:23.086
Hey, you always got a home here,
Dempsey.

24:24.004 --> 24:25.589
Look, you can stop by anytime.

24:28.091 --> 24:29.301
No, I don't think I can.

24:40.061 --> 24:42.147
No, man. This is some rich kid shit.

24:43.273 --> 24:45.901
Ask anybody, I sell cheap Mexican shit

24:45.984 --> 24:48.737
at the gym.
It gets me a bigger cut.

24:48.820 --> 24:50.697
So, to be clear, you have no recollection

24:50.780 --> 24:53.116
of selling these steroids
or anything like them

24:53.408 --> 24:55.243
to Clay Jensen or his friends?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.496
This is some good shit.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.124
Okay? I couldn't get my hands on it
if I wanted to.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.215
He's still back there.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.927
Probably gonna transfer him to County.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.177
Jesus!

25:16.681 --> 25:17.682
Are you okay?

25:18.808 --> 25:20.810
You would tell me if you weren't?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.064
'Cause clearly I don't always know.

25:35.909 --> 25:36.910
When I was five...

25:39.412 --> 25:40.747
my mom had this boyfriend.

25:42.999 --> 25:45.627
This fucked-up guy
who would just get high with her.

25:48.672 --> 25:49.672
When...

25:50.298 --> 25:51.841
she'd pass out, he would...

25:54.886 --> 25:56.054
just come to my bed.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.146
At first, he would just...

26:07.524 --> 26:08.567
put his hands on me.

26:11.820 --> 26:12.821
Then he started...

26:15.365 --> 26:19.119
He started making me put my hands
on his...

26:22.747 --> 26:23.832
And he would be hard.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.377
He...

26:33.174 --> 26:34.174
He...

26:36.803 --> 26:38.513
[breathing shakily]

26:38.805 --> 26:41.516
He'd put his fingers in my mouth
and start to jerk off.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.316
He only lived with us
for a couple of years.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.568
On and off.

26:55.363 --> 26:56.781
When I was on the streets...

26:58.575 --> 26:59.701
and I needed money...

27:04.039 --> 27:05.040
I would do stuff...

27:06.666 --> 27:07.666
to guys.

27:09.919 --> 27:12.088
Sometimes, they would do stuff that...

27:14.424 --> 27:15.550
we didn't talk about.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.638
But that I didn't want to do.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.436
I just felt like I was five again, and...

27:27.687 --> 27:28.687
it was all my fault.

27:30.607 --> 27:31.607
Hey.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.318
I'm so sorry.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.655
God.

27:38.907 --> 27:42.035
And all this time,
you've been listening to me,

27:42.911 --> 27:46.247
and helping me,
and letting me preach to you

27:46.331 --> 27:48.500
- about recovery.
- You needed time.

27:52.128 --> 27:53.128
For yourself.

27:55.924 --> 27:56.925
You deserve that.

27:59.135 --> 28:01.304
I want to be there for you so bad, Jess.

28:02.889 --> 28:05.016
I didn't want my shit to get in the way
of your shit.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.102
Your shit is my shit.

28:08.061 --> 28:09.062
We share shit.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.022
This is getting gross.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.191
[both laughing]

28:22.033 --> 28:23.033
I love you.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.201
I love you.

28:27.872 --> 28:29.666
[Sheriff]
Your lawyer will be here shortly.

28:31.793 --> 28:33.086
I didn't do anything.

28:33.336 --> 28:35.046
It's best we wait for your lawyer.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.519
You guys just decided it was me.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.480
Oh, we did? How'd you figure?

28:53.064 --> 28:55.191
Mrs. Walker told you I hated Bryce
and that was it.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.070
It was a little more than that.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.155
We had a fight

29:00.530 --> 29:02.157
and an argument, that's all.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.575
Those things happen.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.411
What exactly did you guys argue about?

29:15.128 --> 29:17.528
You went to that Homecoming game
to confront him, didn't you?

29:18.465 --> 29:20.300
No, I... I was there for Justin.

29:21.551 --> 29:24.971
That's why I'm here.
What's your excuse? You hate football.

29:25.054 --> 29:27.766
- Yes, but Caleb loves football.
- I played in high school.

29:27.849 --> 29:30.268
- Please don't ask him. Oh, God.
- What position? Sorry.

29:30.351 --> 29:32.771
I tell him one story, and now
he calls me "Glory days."

29:32.854 --> 29:34.063
[band playing]

29:35.231 --> 29:37.901
Hey, I thought Ani wasn't allowed
to come to the game?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.696
[indistinct chanting]

29:43.656 --> 29:44.824
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

29:45.867 --> 29:47.160
Kickoff's in five!

29:52.332 --> 29:54.334
[indistinct conversation]

29:58.797 --> 29:59.881
What the hell?

30:41.506 --> 30:44.175
- Hey, you lost?
- I need to speak to Ani right now. Alone.

30:44.259 --> 30:46.427
Hey, all good. I got it.
I'll be right back.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.019
I'm sorry.

30:56.437 --> 30:58.317
I should've called,
but my mum went to bed early

30:58.398 --> 31:00.066
and I was able to sneak off after all.

31:00.149 --> 31:03.319
Stop. Just stop. I don't want
to hear any more of your excuses.

31:04.654 --> 31:06.072
Why him, Ani?

31:06.656 --> 31:07.657
Why Bryce?

31:08.616 --> 31:09.868
I mean, why would you...

31:09.951 --> 31:11.369
How could you kiss him?

31:12.912 --> 31:14.956
It's... it's not what you think.

31:15.039 --> 31:16.199
You said you didn't know him,

31:16.249 --> 31:18.793
that you didn't speak to him,
but you're, what, you're friends?

31:18.877 --> 31:20.253
- More than friends?
- No.

31:20.336 --> 31:21.546
No, we're not.

31:21.754 --> 31:24.215
I was just wishing him luck
at the game, and he...

31:24.591 --> 31:26.593
He misinterpreted my intentions.

31:27.176 --> 31:28.344
And it was an accident.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.014
It was a mistake!
Bryce means nothing to me!

31:31.097 --> 31:32.098
So, do you regret it?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.559
Do you regret kissing him
like you regret kissing me?

31:34.642 --> 31:36.769
Clay, this has nothing to do with you.

31:36.853 --> 31:38.354
Of course it has to do with me!

31:38.438 --> 31:41.065
Why, because I only exist
as a function of you?

31:41.149 --> 31:42.918
- Because I thought we were friends.
- We are!

31:42.942 --> 31:43.943
We were.

31:45.153 --> 31:46.153
Clay, wait.

31:48.406 --> 31:49.407
[Ani] <i> I won't lie to you,</i>

31:50.450 --> 31:52.577
<i>at that moment, in his eyes</i>

31:53.036 --> 31:54.036
<i>I saw...</i>

31:54.662 --> 31:55.662
<i>anger.</i>

31:56.080 --> 31:58.082
<i>Hatred. But not for me.</i>

31:58.166 --> 31:59.500
[crowd cheering]

32:00.293 --> 32:01.293
[Ani] <i>For Bryce.</i>

32:01.836 --> 32:06.090
<i>Over the first half, the anger
and the hatred only burned hotter.</i>

32:06.341 --> 32:09.093
<i>By half-time,
he was ready to go after Bryce.</i>

32:09.260 --> 32:10.553
[air horn blaring]

32:12.430 --> 32:13.848
[chanting]

32:14.474 --> 32:16.059
[Ani] <i>He was about to get his chance.</i>

32:17.226 --> 32:20.688
[protesters] Hey, hey. Ho, ho.
Rape culture has got to go!

32:20.772 --> 32:21.648
Hey, hey...

32:21.731 --> 32:24.400
- Did you know she was gonna do this?
- No idea.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.862
[Jessica] Jocks are the bullies,
criminals and rapists of Liberty!

32:28.571 --> 32:30.011
Well, she's got their attention now.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.157
...go unpunished.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.700
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.

32:32.784 --> 32:34.845
- [protesters] Rape culture has got to go!
- Holy shit.

32:34.869 --> 32:37.413
Hey, hey. Ho, ho.
Rape culture has got to go!

32:37.497 --> 32:39.165
It seems unwise.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.542
[protesters] Ho, ho.
Rape culture has got to go!

32:41.626 --> 32:44.587
Hey, hey! Ho, ho!
Rape culture has got to go!

32:45.755 --> 32:46.798
What the fuck?

32:57.809 --> 32:59.644
[Caleb] Seems like it's gonna go wrong.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.484
- Oh, hell no!
- [Caleb] Things just went wrong!

33:06.734 --> 33:08.111
[coach blowing whistle]

33:10.488 --> 33:12.865
- We're going,
- Yeah, we're so going.

33:12.949 --> 33:14.909
- Tony, sit down.
- My friends are down there.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.495
I know, but third strike,
your life is over.

33:17.578 --> 33:19.080
Tony, he's right. Just stay.

33:21.082 --> 33:22.250
Fuck!

33:26.379 --> 33:29.841
[Ani] <i> And yeah, Clay went after Bryce
in that fight.</i>

33:32.093 --> 33:33.219
<i>And lots of people saw it.</i>

33:36.597 --> 33:38.391
<i>But there was something
they didn't see,</i>

33:39.142 --> 33:40.142
<i>wasn't there?</i>

33:40.518 --> 33:42.603
- [Justin] Clay! Listen!
- Get off of me!

33:42.687 --> 33:43.914
- I'm gonna kill him!
- Let's go.

33:43.938 --> 33:45.773
I'm gonna fucking kill him!

33:45.940 --> 33:47.780
- You're gonna get crushed out here.
- Get off!

33:48.317 --> 33:50.361
- Fuck! Where'd he go?
- [Justin] Clay!

33:51.821 --> 33:53.197
Where the fuck did he go?

33:53.489 --> 33:54.866
[Ani] <i>That wasn't the last of it.</i>

33:57.618 --> 33:58.995
I lost Bryce in the crowd.

33:59.954 --> 34:02.540
I saw they were starting to pull out kids,
so I ran.

34:03.124 --> 34:06.127
Justin didn't need a ride home,
so after I dropped off Tyler...

34:07.587 --> 34:08.587
I went to talk to Bryce.

34:11.466 --> 34:12.467
Just to talk.

34:17.179 --> 34:18.179
Fuck!

34:29.859 --> 34:31.610
Fuck!

34:36.908 --> 34:37.908
Fuck this!

34:43.831 --> 34:47.043
"I'm fucking going to... kill you."

34:48.043 --> 34:49.712
Do you recall sending that text?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.255
Yes, but...

34:52.380 --> 34:54.257
And you were at his house
when you sent it?

34:54.342 --> 34:56.886
- Yes, but he wasn't there.
- Mm-hmm, but he replied, right?

34:57.804 --> 34:58.888
"Buddy, let's talk."

34:59.055 --> 35:02.183
Sounds like he wanted to meet up
and you wanted to get your hands on him.

35:02.266 --> 35:04.852
- Don't put words in his mouth.
- After that, you texted back.

35:05.311 --> 35:07.814
"I don't want to talk. I want you dead."

35:09.482 --> 35:12.193
Bryce died within an hour
of receiving that text.

35:12.276 --> 35:13.778
Seems like quite a coincidence.

35:13.861 --> 35:16.656
It <i>is</i> a coincidence! When I said that,
I swear I didn't mean it.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.200
If you didn't mean it,
then why did you delete the message

35:19.283 --> 35:20.576
after we found his body?

35:20.660 --> 35:22.537
I was scared!
I knew this was gonna happen.

35:28.584 --> 35:30.128
We're cutting class to lift weights?

35:33.089 --> 35:35.133
Did you just trick me into a PT session?

35:36.259 --> 35:37.301
[stammering] I...

35:38.010 --> 35:39.303
I wanted to talk to you alone.

35:40.012 --> 35:41.012
What's up?

35:42.974 --> 35:45.601
- Maybe you should have a seat.
- Okay.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.900
I have to tell you something, but I'm...

35:55.695 --> 35:58.335
God, I know I should've said something
or I should've told somebody

35:58.406 --> 36:01.325
or done something earlier,
but I... I have to now.

36:03.452 --> 36:04.453
Zach, what is it?

36:07.790 --> 36:08.790
I, um...

36:14.714 --> 36:15.715
I killed Bryce.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.804
That's... Don't say that.

36:21.888 --> 36:23.097
- It's the truth.
- No.

36:23.181 --> 36:25.981
- Don't fucking say that to me.
- I can't let Clay go to jail for this.

36:26.017 --> 36:28.311
- I have to go to the cops.
- Listen to me. Listen.

36:28.978 --> 36:32.106
Let it play out. They don't have anything,
they're bluffing.

36:32.190 --> 36:34.960
You don't know that, Alex. You told me
you don't know that. You don't...

36:34.984 --> 36:37.104
But if you were in trouble,
they would've come to you.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.197
They have no idea.

36:40.865 --> 36:43.326
Clay will get off.
You can walk, it'll be fine.

36:43.409 --> 36:44.409
Alex, I killed...

36:45.494 --> 36:46.704
I killed somebody.

36:46.996 --> 36:47.996
You...

36:50.124 --> 36:51.292
I don't believe that you did.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.336
And even if you did,

36:53.419 --> 36:54.921
after what Bryce did to you,

36:55.338 --> 36:57.733
and to everyone, how would it be justice
if you went to jail?

36:57.757 --> 36:59.926
And how is it justice if Clay does?

37:17.777 --> 37:18.945
Well, I'm leaving now.

37:20.905 --> 37:21.906
Not that it matters,

37:21.989 --> 37:24.158
since you've decided
I'm no longer your daughter.

37:24.575 --> 37:25.575
So...

37:29.580 --> 37:30.957
You know, it is possible

37:31.540 --> 37:33.960
to be both a devoted daughter
and a loyal friend.

37:34.043 --> 37:36.295
I know you think it's either or,
but it's not.

37:37.421 --> 37:40.508
You refuse to trust anyone.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.178
But I'm not willing
to live like that anymore.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.975
So, I'm gonna go help a friend
who needs me right now...

37:50.142 --> 37:52.103
and I hope you have the same privilege.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.188
Some day.

38:06.617 --> 38:07.617
Valdez!

38:09.078 --> 38:12.164
Do I have anyone here for Diego Valdez?

38:13.124 --> 38:14.125
You here for Valdez?

38:15.626 --> 38:16.877
No, um...

38:18.838 --> 38:21.507
- Is Deputy Standall around?
- He's off-duty right now.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.425
Oh.

38:25.261 --> 38:26.762
Can I help you with something?

38:31.726 --> 38:33.269
I'm here to make a confession.

38:33.811 --> 38:35.980
To... confess.

38:37.315 --> 38:38.816
Okay. Hang on.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.319
Let me get someone out here.

39:08.846 --> 39:09.846
Bill?

39:09.889 --> 39:11.057
I didn't know you were home.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.017
These yours from the hospital?

39:13.726 --> 39:15.936
I don't normally bring supplies home
from work.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.105
Are they the same brand
the hospital uses?

39:18.397 --> 39:20.608
No, this is a consumer brand.
What's going on?

39:22.151 --> 39:23.152
[cell ringing]

39:26.697 --> 39:27.697
Standall.

39:30.659 --> 39:31.659
Yeah.

39:31.869 --> 39:33.245
Okay. I'll be there in 15.

39:35.164 --> 39:37.958
- They need me at the station.
- Tell me what's going on.

39:40.669 --> 39:41.712
It's gonna be fine.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.214
Okay.

39:49.345 --> 39:51.597
[Standall] You okay, Zach?
You want water or something?

39:53.808 --> 39:54.808
I did it.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.559
It was me.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.606
I killed Bryce Walker, the night

40:00.689 --> 40:03.442
- of the Homecoming game at the pier.
- Okay. Slow down.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.571
What exactly happened that night?

40:08.364 --> 40:09.532
Start at the beginning.

40:11.242 --> 40:14.036
My mom, she... she drove me to the game.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.080
My dad used to, before he...

40:17.957 --> 40:20.000
She drove you to the game.
It's Homecoming.

40:20.876 --> 40:23.254
It's a big night
for the team captain, right?

40:23.337 --> 40:26.257
And we were fired up, you know?
We had a lot to prove. I...

40:27.550 --> 40:28.843
I had a lot to prove,

40:28.926 --> 40:31.387
and I knew that there was gonna be
a lot of people watching.

40:33.222 --> 40:34.222
[whooping]

40:34.306 --> 40:36.892
[Ani] <i>Zach told you that it all started
before the game,</i>

40:37.476 --> 40:38.519
<i>in the tunnels.</i>

40:39.061 --> 40:40.312
[Chloe] Hey, number 85!

40:41.313 --> 40:42.815
Hey, what are you doing here?

40:43.149 --> 40:44.829
Still your official cheerleader, aren't I?

40:44.859 --> 40:47.069
- Wouldn't trade you for anyone else.
- [Chloe laughing]

40:48.654 --> 40:50.823
Uh, I gotta go,
but I'll see you out there.

40:53.951 --> 40:55.453
Hey, Chloe. Wait up.

40:58.956 --> 40:59.956
Hey.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.667
It's nice to see you.

41:02.751 --> 41:05.212
- I should probably get outside.
- Whoa, hold up.

41:05.296 --> 41:06.296
I...

41:06.964 --> 41:08.382
[stammering] You seem great.

41:09.383 --> 41:11.635
- Yeah, I'm doing really good.
- Good.

41:13.053 --> 41:14.847
It's nice to see you happy.

41:16.140 --> 41:18.517
You've always had this... spark.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.730
And I'm just glad that
after everything I put you through,

41:22.813 --> 41:23.813
you still have it.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.420
Not that I could take anything away
from you. I mean,

41:28.444 --> 41:30.779
you're one of the strongest people
that I know.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.826
Bryce, you should know I was pregnant.

41:38.162 --> 41:39.163
It was yours.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.166
I had an abortion.

41:44.793 --> 41:47.213
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before.

41:55.638 --> 41:56.764
Ah...

41:58.599 --> 41:59.683
Are you okay?

42:04.897 --> 42:05.897
[sighs]

42:06.065 --> 42:08.484
I'm so sorry
you had to go through that alone.

42:09.652 --> 42:10.653
I wasn't alone.

42:11.570 --> 42:12.571
I had Zach.

42:13.864 --> 42:14.865
He was with me.

42:16.116 --> 42:17.117
Through all of it.

42:22.831 --> 42:25.209
Good. Good, good.

42:27.294 --> 42:28.294
Um...

42:30.047 --> 42:31.257
I... I should go.

42:42.476 --> 42:43.956
[player] Come on! Let's go, let's go!

42:59.868 --> 43:01.996
[Bryce] Nice block in the back.
Is that your strategy?

43:02.079 --> 43:05.124
- Cheat and hope you don't get caught?
- It was clean, unlike you.

43:05.207 --> 43:08.794
You stole my girlfriend, buddy.
You don't think that's for free, do you?

43:17.219 --> 43:18.846
- [player] Watch him!
- [Zach] Let go!

43:29.398 --> 43:30.958
- [whistle blowing]
- [players shouting]

43:30.983 --> 43:32.151

43:33.944 --> 43:35.904
- Fucking asshole.
- How's the knee, Zachy?

43:35.988 --> 43:38.907
I didn't steal Chloe, I supported her.
Which is more than you ever did.

43:38.991 --> 43:40.677
- What the fuck do you know?
- I know enough.

43:40.701 --> 43:42.870
I'm gonna fucking throw you
into next week!

43:42.953 --> 43:44.830
- [referee] Hey! Don't.
- [whistle blowing]

43:44.913 --> 43:47.041
[referee] That's enough!
Back to your sides.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.585
We're letting them hang around.

43:50.961 --> 43:54.173
They think that they can play with us?
They can't fucking play with us!

43:55.507 --> 43:56.967
Fucking Hillcrest, man.

43:57.301 --> 43:59.428
They want us to think
that we're the losers.

44:00.763 --> 44:02.003
That they're gonna get this win

44:02.056 --> 44:04.776
just like they get every other
fucking thing they want in this world.

44:04.808 --> 44:07.603
But they will not get it.
We will not let that happen!

44:11.690 --> 44:13.275
Because this is how they do it.

44:13.734 --> 44:16.487
For the rest of your lives,
this is what's gonna happen.

44:16.570 --> 44:17.738
They're gonna look at you,

44:18.781 --> 44:20.324
and they're gonna come at you.

44:20.491 --> 44:22.993
They will make you feel
like you do not belong.

44:23.077 --> 44:26.372
They will make you feel
like you can't have what they have.

44:27.456 --> 44:30.185
And they will keep leaving you out
and they will keep pushing you down

44:30.209 --> 44:32.378

"Fuck this, I belong here."

Some of you

44:37.383 --> 44:38.383

44:39.802 --> 44:42.221
Some of you think I'm a narc
or I don't know, whatever.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.223
Honestly? I don't give a fuck.

44:45.182 --> 44:47.601
'Cause I know who I am. Do you?

44:49.561 --> 44:50.561
Do you?

44:51.397 --> 44:53.524
Because winning
at the cost of who you are,

44:54.274 --> 44:57.361
winning at the cost
of becoming someone that you hate,

44:57.569 --> 44:58.654
means nothing.

45:04.702 --> 45:08.163
I would bleed for any single one of you.
I would.

45:09.039 --> 45:10.582
I would lay down my life.

45:11.834 --> 45:12.834
No lie.

45:14.044 --> 45:15.629
Because that's a promise that I made.

45:18.257 --> 45:19.341
What will you do?

45:22.761 --> 45:23.762
One half left.

45:26.140 --> 45:27.180
Let's show 'em who we are.

45:27.224 --> 45:28.726

- Let's get this win.

46:19.193 --> 46:21.361
Your fucking leg. Charlie! Charlie!

46:22.196 --> 46:23.956
All right, man.
We're gonna get you up, okay?

46:24.656 --> 46:26.256
[Zach] <i> The team doc knew it was my knee.</i>

46:26.742 --> 46:28.535
So, he put me in an ambulance.

46:29.870 --> 46:32.623
My mom met me at the hospital.
The doctors looked at my leg.

46:33.332 --> 46:34.583
Did a few X-rays...

46:36.418 --> 46:38.295
Put a brace on me
and then sent me home.

46:41.298 --> 46:43.550
But... [sighing] I didn't stay home.

46:44.927 --> 46:48.639
Before we go any further, I want
to bring Sheriff Díaz to hear the rest.

46:48.722 --> 46:50.057
- Okay?
- Yeah.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.937
Kid, I gotta ask you,
you want to call your mom?

46:55.312 --> 46:56.312
No.

46:56.522 --> 46:57.523
No, sir.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.233
- Maybe a lawyer?
- No, sir.

47:03.028 --> 47:04.028
Okay.

47:08.075 --> 47:09.075
[door closing]

47:19.920 --> 47:20.920
I'm ready.

47:21.588 --> 47:22.588
I want to do this.

47:23.090 --> 47:25.008
Tyler, what you're doing is so brave.

47:26.218 --> 47:28.053
We'll be right here waiting for you.

47:29.054 --> 47:30.389
You're not alone in this.

47:39.147 --> 47:40.147
Okay.

47:42.025 --> 47:43.025
Okay.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.656
[Tyler] Excuse me. Um...

47:48.532 --> 47:50.325
I would like to file a report.

47:52.327 --> 47:55.706
Hey, Zach. I've filled Sheriff Díaz in
on everything you've told me so far.

47:55.789 --> 47:56.789
So...

47:58.250 --> 48:01.461
why don't you go ahead and continue?
Tell us what happened next.

48:03.171 --> 48:06.592
Okay. So, I knew the Hillcrest bus
would take them back there.

48:09.261 --> 48:10.470
So, I waited for Bryce.

48:11.388 --> 48:12.848
And I followed him to the pier.

48:39.666 --> 48:40.792
Zachy!

48:42.127 --> 48:44.296
Didn't expect to see you here.
What's up, friend?

48:44.379 --> 48:47.215
- Fuck you!
- Or not friend.

48:47.674 --> 48:50.218
Walking pretty well there, actually.
What happened to your knee?

48:54.014 --> 48:56.183
- What the fuck?
- I should fucking kill you.

48:56.266 --> 48:59.144
- Okay. Look, I deserved that one.
- You're going to hell.

You took away my future tonight.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.600
You took away mine.

49:38.892 --> 49:39.892
No.

49:41.103 --> 49:42.354
You did that to yourself.

49:44.398 --> 49:45.732

49:49.361 --> 49:50.612
[Bryce] Did you fuck her, Zach?

Chloe?

49:54.449 --> 49:56.743
Did you fuck her? How many times?

49:58.537 --> 50:00.747
Did she scream for you

50:00.831 --> 50:02.290
[Bryce laughing]

50:05.877 --> 50:06.962
Chloe's my friend.

50:08.505 --> 50:10.632
Sorry you never had a friend in your life.

50:11.174 --> 50:13.760

to put on my...

52:03.662 --> 52:04.662
Yeah.

52:05.413 --> 52:08.750
Yeah, mostly, he was yelling things at me.
He was in and out.

52:09.417 --> 52:11.753
- But immobile? He couldn't stand?
- No, sir.

52:11.837 --> 52:15.132
No, I broke his leg pretty good.
And one of his arms, I think.

52:19.010 --> 52:21.138
So, you're here to confess
to his murder?

52:24.724 --> 52:25.724
Yes, sir.
