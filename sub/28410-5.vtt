00:02.335 --> 00:04.337
(beeping)

00:08.717 --> 00:10.927
{\an5}ORDERLY (over intercom):
He's waking up.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.562
Can you hear me, Mr. Hanks?

00:23.231 --> 00:24.441
What's going on?

00:24.524 --> 00:25.734
Try to relax.

00:25.817 --> 00:28.903
Do you know your name?

00:28.987 --> 00:30.905
Raff Hanks.

00:30.989 --> 00:32.198
Great.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.159
{\an5}Do you know who
the president is?

00:34.242 --> 00:36.786
<i>(crowd cheering)</i>

00:36.870 --> 00:38.288
{\an8}CROWD (chanting):

{\an8}Four more years!
Four more years!

{\an8}Four more years!

Four more years!

{\an3}MAURA:
Well, you did it.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.681
<i>We</i> did it.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.183
CROWD:
Four more years!

00:58.266 --> 00:59.517
Stevens did it.

00:59.601 --> 01:00.894
{\an1}All right.

01:00.977 --> 01:05.315
{\an1}But with our help.
Our numbers, our data.

01:05.397 --> 01:07.317
We gave him this election.

01:07.400 --> 01:08.777
Can you not jinx things?

01:08.860 --> 01:10.779
I mean, no one's even counted
any votes yet.

01:10.862 --> 01:13.198
Oh, God.
(clears throat)

01:13.281 --> 01:14.949
I almost forgot.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.619
{\an8}Guess what came
in the mail today.

01:17.702 --> 01:18.745
{\an9}Hmm.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.290
{\an5}Subtle.

01:18.828 --> 01:22.290
{\an1}They never thought Stevens
would get reelected.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.042
Especially not with me
running his campaign.

01:24.125 --> 01:24.876
They were wrong.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.170
Again, can you just
not jinx things?

01:27.253 --> 01:30.006
Come on, you've seen the polls.
You see the crowds?

01:30.089 --> 01:33.218
{\an1}We took the most unpopular
president in American history,

01:33.301 --> 01:35.178
and we turned it around.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.181
I want Justin Timberlake
to play me in the HBO movie.

01:38.264 --> 01:40.016
You really think they're going
to turn this into a movie?

01:40.099 --> 01:41.142
Of course they are.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.270
It's only the greatest comeback
in American history.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.065
Well, now you've
really jinxed things, so...

01:47.148 --> 01:50.109
Raff, Maura, the results
are coming in.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.361
The president wants to see you.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.655
CROWD:
Stevens! Stevens! Stevens!

01:53.738 --> 01:57.700
Stevens! Stevens!
Stevens! Stevens!

01:57.784 --> 02:00.995
It all started out so well.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.497
{\an5}ORDERLY:
Do you know why you're here,
Raff...

02:02.580 --> 02:04.541
who did this to you?

02:04.624 --> 02:07.377
Do you know where you are?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.253
Who are you?

02:09.336 --> 02:13.716
{\an5}I'm here by order of the
president of the United States.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.594
(sighs)
Then I'm fucked.

02:22.141 --> 02:23.810
Hey.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.938
(clears throat)

02:29.941 --> 02:31.734
Thanks.

02:29.941 --> 02:31.734
{\an3}Thank you.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.031
{\an1}STEVENS:
What the fuck, Raff?!

02:37.115 --> 02:38.700
Mr. President?

02:38.783 --> 02:41.578
They're saying
I just lost New York,

02:41.661 --> 02:44.038
lost New Jersey.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.082
I'm from fuckin' New Jersey.

02:46.165 --> 02:48.751
I'm Mr. Fuckin' New Jersey!

02:48.835 --> 02:50.753
{\an1}We're losing the whole
goddamn country!

02:50.837 --> 02:53.631
{\an5}No, my data says...

02:50.837 --> 02:53.631
Oh, your data's horseshit!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.550
I listened to you.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.052
{\an1}I listened to you.
Your numbers and your polls

02:58.136 --> 03:00.763
{\an1}and your fancy data
and your high-tech baloney.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.434
{\an1}And guess what.
I lost.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.103
I am a one-term joke.

03:07.186 --> 03:10.106
I'm a diaper filled
with baby shit,

03:10.189 --> 03:13.943
and it is all your fault!

03:14.027 --> 03:15.820
Fuck!

03:19.824 --> 03:22.869
{\an3}Raff, listen, it's gonna
be okay. All right?

03:22.952 --> 03:24.662
You can come back from this.

03:24.746 --> 03:27.248
I mean, you're the
wunderkind, right?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.006
{\an5}REPORTER (on TV):
Voters are angry.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.633
{\an5}After two years in office,
the president is facing

03:36.716 --> 03:38.968
{\an5}increasing criticism
for his handling of the economy,

03:39.052 --> 03:41.429
{\an5}increasing crime, the
environment, and foreign policy.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.139
{\an5}MAN:
I mean, the world is a mess.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.475
{\an5}And these politicians,
they're not helping anybody.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.851
{\an5}We should just throw out
the whole system,

03:46.935 --> 03:47.727
start over again.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.979
{\an5}Well, let me ask
my distinguished panel.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.023
{\an5}What should the president do
about the situation

03:52.106 --> 03:53.149
in the Middle East?

03:53.232 --> 03:54.651
Thanks for asking, Sam.

03:54.734 --> 03:56.986
{\an1}"Well, you're
one of the most admired

03:57.070 --> 03:58.321
political minds
in the business."

03:58.404 --> 04:01.532
That I am, Sam.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.618
That I am.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.871
I just can't pay my rent.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.250
Hey, buddy.

04:12.961 --> 04:14.671
You really ran
Stevens' campaign?

04:14.754 --> 04:18.341
I did. I ran it
right into the ground.

04:18.423 --> 04:19.509
(laughs)

04:23.596 --> 04:25.181
{\an5}REPORTER:
In lighter news...

04:25.264 --> 04:27.392
{\an1}Tommy, come on,
hit me with another.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.686
{\an5}...look no further than
11-year-old YouTube sensation

04:29.769 --> 04:30.812
Oliver Foley.

04:30.895 --> 04:35.525
{\an5}His latest video is racking up
millions of hits because

04:35.608 --> 04:38.069
Oliver's running for president.

04:38.152 --> 04:41.531
{\an5}Oh, hey, hi.
I'm Oliver Henry Foley,

04:41.614 --> 04:46.369
{\an5}and I'm announcing my candidacy
for president of the USA.

04:46.452 --> 04:49.831
{\an5}Here's why. I want people
to be nice to each other.

04:49.914 --> 04:52.208
{\an5}I really do.
I know it sounds cheesy,

04:52.291 --> 04:53.459
but it's the truth.

04:53.543 --> 04:57.088
{\an5}And it's a good enough reason
to run for president as any.

04:57.171 --> 04:59.507
{\an5}I also believe that
everyone should go to school

04:59.590 --> 05:00.883
and play video games,

05:00.967 --> 05:03.052
{\an5}because it's good
for your hand-eye coordination.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.556
{\an5}I may be a kid,
but I sure do get America.

05:06.639 --> 05:09.851
{\an5}It's the land of equality
and freedom for everyone.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.061
Except maybe my little sister.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.938
You should run
that kid's campaign.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.191
{\an5}He tells it like it is.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.191
That's crazy.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.776
Eight million views crazy.

05:18.860 --> 05:21.738
Considering all the crap
coming out of Washington,

05:21.821 --> 05:23.031
{\an3}I'd vote for that kid
in a heartbeat.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.950
Me, too.
I like what he's saying.

05:26.034 --> 05:28.578
He's a little cutie.

05:34.959 --> 05:38.629
Meet Raff Hanks, a wunderkind.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.923
Once the most successful
campaign manager

05:41.007 --> 05:42.592
of his generation.

05:42.675 --> 05:46.763
Now Raff finds himself
in a valley of booze and regret.

05:46.846 --> 05:51.100
One filled with bad choices
and even worse polling.

05:51.184 --> 05:54.771
He's about to embark on
a misguided road to redemption.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.731
And on his way back to the top,

05:56.814 --> 05:59.025
he'll have to take a dark detour

05:59.108 --> 06:01.319
through The Twilight Zone.

06:03.863 --> 06:04.989
<i>(The Twilight Zone</i> theme
playing)

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
NARRATOR: <i> You're traveling</i>
<i>through another dimension,</i>

06:07.366 --> 06:10.912
<i>a dimension not only of</i>
<i>sight and sound but of mind.</i>

06:10.995 --> 06:14.123
<i>It is the middle ground</i>
<i>between light and shadow,</i>

06:14.207 --> 06:16.918
<i>between science</i>
<i>and superstition.</i>

06:17.001 --> 06:19.462
{\an8}<i>And it lies between</i>
<i>the pit of one's fears</i>

06:19.545 --> 06:22.298
{\an8}<i>and the summit</i>
<i>of one's knowledge.</i>

06:22.381 --> 06:25.551
<i>You are now traveling through</i>
<i>a dimension of imagination.</i>

06:25.635 --> 06:29.472
<i>You've just crossed over</i>
<i>into The Twilight Zone.</i>

06:33.434 --> 06:37.980
{\an5}ORDERLY:
Mr. Hanks, you did
a great service for our country.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.857
Jesus.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.110
Our country?

06:42.193 --> 06:44.821
I saw an angle, man.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.989
I saw my shot, I took it.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.991
(monitor beeping rapidly)

06:50.576 --> 06:53.412
(groaning)

07:22.441 --> 07:25.987
{\an8}Mmm. This really is delicious.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.822
{\an7}Mmm.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.822
{\an9}OLIVER:
Tuesdays is spaghetti,

07:27.905 --> 07:28.823
{\an8}and Wednesdays
is hamburgers.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.408
{\an8}Cheeseburgers.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.909
{\an8}Cheeseburgers,
if you're into that.

07:31.993 --> 07:34.579
{\an8}Can you pass the
Parmesan cheese?

07:34.662 --> 07:37.081
{\an8}Oliver.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.081
{\an7}Yeah?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.833
{\an9}Do you really want
to be president?

07:38.916 --> 07:42.170
{\an8}Yep. I'm sick of
all the war stuff

07:42.253 --> 07:44.672
{\an7}and the environment stuff
and the fact that

07:44.755 --> 07:47.133
{\an8}everybody lies all the time

07:47.216 --> 07:49.177
{\an8}and that we only get two weeks
off at Christmas break.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.261
{\an8}Wait.

07:50.344 --> 07:51.971
{\an9}If Oliver gets
to be president,

07:52.054 --> 07:53.347
{\an8}do I get to be vice president?

07:53.431 --> 07:55.308
{\an9}Uh, maybe, honey.
Eat your salad.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.728
{\an7}I first started
my YouTube channel

07:58.811 --> 08:01.439
{\an7}because my friend Charlie had
one, and I wanted one, too.

08:01.522 --> 08:03.733
{\an8}Then I started vlogging
about <i> Minecraft,</i>

08:03.816 --> 08:05.234
{\an8}which was sort of boring
because <i> Minecraft</i> is

08:05.318 --> 08:07.862
{\an9}for little kids, and
I'm not little anymore.

08:07.945 --> 08:09.739
{\an8}Then I started vlogging
about <i> Fortnite,</i>

08:09.822 --> 08:10.907
{\an8}which got me a bunch of views.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.576
{\an7}But then I decided
to run for president,

08:13.659 --> 08:16.412
{\an8}and I got 12 million views.

08:16.495 --> 08:18.372
{\an8}And then you showed up.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.374
{\an8}And then I showed up.

08:20.458 --> 08:22.460
{\an8}What'd I just say?

08:23.628 --> 08:28.049
{\an8}HELEN:
Really, Raff, why are you here?

08:28.132 --> 08:30.218
{\an7}I know this thing has
gotten a lot of coverage,

08:30.301 --> 08:32.303
{\an8}but he's a kid, it's a joke.

08:32.385 --> 08:33.888
{\an7}Not to me.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.265
{\an7}People are really responding
to what Oliver is saying.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.226
{\an9}He's 11.

08:36.349 --> 08:38.226
{\an8}It's a technicality.

08:38.308 --> 08:39.809
{\an9}(laughs)
To being president.

08:39.894 --> 08:41.729
{\an7}Listen, your name will
be on the ballot.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.938
{\an7}He'll just be
the one in charge.

08:43.022 --> 08:47.109
{\an8}Oh. This is getting
better and better.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.403
{\an8}Listen, A-Andrew Johnson
was a tailor.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.280
{\an8}Teddy Roosevelt was a rancher.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.949
{\an8}Jimmy Carter was
a peanut farmer.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.492
{\an8}This country is very open

08:54.575 --> 08:56.786
{\an8}to leaders
without political baggage.

08:56.869 --> 09:00.456
{\an8}Raff, I googled you.
I did some research.

09:00.539 --> 09:02.792
{\an8}I know you've had a hard run.
You battled the booze...

09:02.875 --> 09:07.755
Joseph, I'm off it, completely.
I am a new man.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.259
I mean, I am drinking chamomile
tea, for the love of Pete.

09:11.342 --> 09:14.762
Well, still, we see what
you're trying to do here.

09:16.347 --> 09:18.307
You're an opportunist.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.851
Of course I am.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.314
I need this.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.942
This is what I do.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.319
But Oliver, your son,
has tapped into

09:30.403 --> 09:32.947
something very, very real.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.448
He connects with people.

09:35.741 --> 09:37.535
Do you realize how rare
that is in politics,

09:37.618 --> 09:39.662
to actually connect with people?

09:40.913 --> 09:43.708
I honestly believe
Oliver can be president.

09:43.791 --> 09:44.709
Come on, now...

09:44.792 --> 09:47.545
{\an1}And win or lose, when
all this is said and done,

09:47.628 --> 09:49.797
he will have had the experience
of a lifetime.

09:49.880 --> 09:52.216
{\an1}And he will have made enough
money from endorsements

09:52.300 --> 09:54.885
{\an1}and TV deals and book deals
to pay for his college

09:54.969 --> 09:57.888
and Lily's college,
the dog's college.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.017
You'll have your face
back on TV.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.852
{\an1}Exactly.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.855
{\an1}Everybody wins,
nobody gets hurt.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.399
This is the American dream.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.361
We're making a new video.
Lily's gonna film it.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.155
You want to watch?
It's gonna be awesome.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.700
{\an1}(sighs)

10:17.783 --> 10:19.952
(all laughing)

10:21.954 --> 10:23.873

Go.

10:26.834 --> 10:28.627
Go?

10:28.711 --> 10:30.046
{\an3}Yes.

10:28.711 --> 10:30.046
Now?

10:30.129 --> 10:32.548
{\an6}Go now.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.548
Okay. Here are the ten things

10:32.631 --> 10:36.052
I promise the American people
if I'm elected president.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.721
Oh. Hi, Homer.

10:38.804 --> 10:41.349
This is Homer. Anyways,

10:41.432 --> 10:44.018
number one: jobs.
Jobs for everyone.

10:44.101 --> 10:48.064
{\an3}Number two: long weekends,
longer vacations.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.067
Number three:
less <i> Star Wars</i> movies.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.194
Number four:
better air to breathe,

10:53.277 --> 10:55.863
which means more bikes
and less cars.

10:55.946 --> 10:58.407
(over megaphone):
Number five: less war.

10:58.491 --> 11:02.286
Number six: dogs for dog people
and cats for cat people.

11:02.370 --> 11:03.913
Number seven:

11:03.996 --> 11:06.332
more pancake houses
throughout the land, please.

11:06.415 --> 11:10.753
Number eight: free video games
for every American!

11:10.836 --> 11:14.256
Number nine: every month has
to have its own holiday.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.468
Number ten:
dessert is before dinner!

11:17.551 --> 11:19.595
(cheering, applause)

11:19.678 --> 11:22.098
Got hot dogs waiting on the bus.
Ketchup and mustard.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.766
The little juice boxes
like you like.

11:23.849 --> 11:25.267
And baby carrots?

11:25.351 --> 11:27.937
Of course. With ranch dressing.
I'm no monster.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.398
We got CNN and Fox
this afternoon,

11:30.481 --> 11:31.774
Rachel Maddow tonight.

11:31.857 --> 11:33.275
{\an3}She's nice.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.860
Super nice.
And you promised me

11:34.944 --> 11:36.278
the interview
with the <i> Times,</i> remember?

11:36.362 --> 11:37.905
{\an3}Only if we can stop
at the water park

11:37.988 --> 11:39.281
on the way back
to the airport.

11:39.365 --> 11:41.617
You got it.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.577
Hey, what about the song?

11:43.661 --> 11:44.787
And the music video?

11:44.870 --> 11:47.081
I get a lot of views
with my videos.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.958
Recording studio booked,
dancers are rehearsing.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.419
{\an1}It's been
two months now.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.171
You can do better, Raff.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.631
You're right.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.633
I can do better.

11:57.716 --> 11:58.843
{\an3}MAURA:
Wow.

12:00.719 --> 12:03.305
Maura McGowan.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.808
{\an3}What are you doing here on the
mean streets of rural Iowa?

12:05.891 --> 12:09.311
{\an1}I saw your mug on TV,
figured I'd come say hi.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.355
You want to get the band back
together again, don't you?

12:13.607 --> 12:16.777
I wrote you off after Stevens.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.154
I was wrong.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.822
"I was wrong."

12:19.905 --> 12:21.532
My three favorite words
in the English language.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.826
Okay, don't push it.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.327
You know you missed me, Maura.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.621
A little bit.

Good. Come on.

So what are we going to do,

18:16.136 --> 18:17.971
{\an5}No. Joseph...

18:16.136 --> 18:17.971
{\an3}They're destroying
him, Raff.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.223
{\an5}(crying)

18:18.055 --> 18:19.223
{\an3}They're destroying
my boy.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.683
{\an1}No, he's gonna be f...
Lily, Lily, sweetheart...

18:21.767 --> 18:23.143
{\an1}He's gonna be--
you guys.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.728
Come on. You guys...

18:24.812 --> 18:26.480
(Oliver speaking indistinctly)

18:26.563 --> 18:28.857
(laughter)

18:28.941 --> 18:30.609
{\an5}OLIVER:
Mom?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.824
{\an5}Mom? Mom?

18:34.029 --> 18:36.824
(laughter)

18:36.907 --> 18:38.325
Mom.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.259
(beeping rapidly)

18:55.342 --> 18:57.845
(Raff gasping)

18:57.928 --> 18:59.555
Try to relax.

18:59.638 --> 19:03.016
If you're gonna do it,
just do it.

19:03.100 --> 19:06.687
The doctor was held up.
He's on a... different level.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.063
He's on his way.

19:08.146 --> 19:10.023
{\an5}RAFF (screams):
God!

19:08.146 --> 19:10.023
Mr. Hanks!

19:10.107 --> 19:13.068
Put me under!
Save my life or let me die, man!

19:13.151 --> 19:15.153
{\an3}(panting)

19:17.155 --> 19:19.741
{\an5}NEWSCASTER:
Two days before Iowa votes
in the first caucus

19:19.825 --> 19:23.245
{\an5}or primary of the season,
the race is truly shaping up

19:23.328 --> 19:26.456
{\an5}after the embarrassing flameout
of 11-year-old Oliver Foley

19:26.540 --> 19:29.459
{\an5}in a disastrous campaign
led by Raff Hanks,

19:29.543 --> 19:34.256
{\an5}one that will be analyzed and
joked about for decades to...

19:35.549 --> 19:37.426
Thanks for taking pity
on me, Tommy.

19:37.509 --> 19:38.969
{\an3}I don't have pity
on you, Raff.

19:39.052 --> 19:40.929
I just don't want you crying
in the bar again.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.098
Scares the customers.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.309
Right.

19:50.689 --> 19:54.776
{\an3}Well, so much for that
chamomile tea phase, huh?

19:54.860 --> 19:57.905
Yeah, I replaced it with the
"decimate your liver" phase.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.448
It's much more enjoyable.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.116
{\an6}(chuckles)

19:59.531 --> 20:01.116
{\an1}Tommy, would you get
this fine lady

20:01.199 --> 20:02.743
{\an1}a bourbon on
the rocks, please?

20:02.826 --> 20:03.744
{\an3}Make it a
double, please.

20:03.827 --> 20:05.579
Oh, that's my girl.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.080
How you holding up?

20:07.164 --> 20:09.750
{\an3}Well, better than
you are, apparently.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.461
{\an3}(chuckles)
Thanks.

20:12.544 --> 20:15.756
{\an3}Oh, wow.
(chuckles)

20:16.715 --> 20:18.508
So what are you doing here?

20:18.592 --> 20:19.927
I got things to do.

20:20.010 --> 20:21.970
I got nuts to eat.
I got beer to cry into.

20:22.054 --> 20:26.016
No, I really am here, actually,
to see how you're doing.

20:26.099 --> 20:28.352
{\an3}And from the
looks of things,

20:28.435 --> 20:31.605
it's... not a pretty picture.
(chuckles)

20:31.688 --> 20:34.524
You know what the worst part is?

20:34.608 --> 20:36.985
Hmm?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.488
I started this whole thing
to get out of the mess I was in,

20:39.571 --> 20:40.822
but somewhere along the line,

20:40.906 --> 20:43.825
I started liking
what the kid was saying.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.744
Uh-oh.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.496
{\an5}Yeah.

20:45.827 --> 20:47.496
Not the whole

20:47.579 --> 20:49.623
"I actually believe
my candidate" story.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.208
{\an5}I do believe in him.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.208
{\an3}(chuckles)

20:51.291 --> 20:54.002
All right, he didn't know shit
about the tax code.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.629
But he was human.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.297
He was vulnerable,
and that's more than I can say

20:57.381 --> 20:58.966
about everybody else up there.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.010
{\an1}You know, I never should have
let him go on the debate stage.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.179
{\an1}He should've kept making
his videos.

21:04.262 --> 21:05.722
{\an1}We could've done one
about world peace.

21:05.806 --> 21:08.308
{\an1}He could've been holding
a-a homemade globe,

21:08.392 --> 21:09.726
and everyone would have
eaten it up, and no one

21:09.810 --> 21:11.979
{\an5}would give a shit
about the debate.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.979
You know what?

21:12.062 --> 21:14.147
It's too late now. Right?

21:14.231 --> 21:15.691
Yeah.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.235
Yeah, it's too late.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.153
You know, I actually
stopped by their place.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.155
{\an3}The Foleys.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.323
You did?
How they doing?

21:23.407 --> 21:25.867
Um... to be expected.

21:25.951 --> 21:27.703
{\an3}Maybe...

21:27.786 --> 21:29.538
a little bit worse.

21:30.747 --> 21:32.666
{\an3}Well, you know
their dog, Homer?

21:32.749 --> 21:34.084
Yeah?

21:34.167 --> 21:36.336
He's got some kind of cancer.
He's gonna die.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.131
No. No.

21:39.214 --> 21:40.757
Yeah.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.051
Oh, God, I fucked everything up.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.511
I even killed their dog.

21:44.594 --> 21:47.180
Oliver says hi, though.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.558
He did?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.101
He doesn't blame you.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.020
He wanted me to tell you that.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.188
Oh, he's a good kid.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.315
He also wanted me to ask you
if you thought it was okay

21:57.399 --> 22:00.193
for him to post a vlog
about his dying dog.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.112
Why not, I guess.

22:02.195 --> 22:04.197
{\an3}I mean, that's
what I said.

22:04.281 --> 22:07.075
{\an3}It's really
sad, you know?

22:07.159 --> 22:08.869
I mean, it's

22:08.952 --> 22:10.746
sweet how much he...

22:10.829 --> 22:13.540
cares about that poor animal.

22:17.794 --> 22:20.255
Oh, Jesus.

22:20.338 --> 22:21.506
It's perfect.

22:22.883 --> 22:24.468
A vlog about a dying dog.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.054
Oh, my God, provided it's done
correctly, it's perfect.

22:27.137 --> 22:29.097
{\an5}Raff...

22:27.137 --> 22:29.097
Are we on the ballot still?

22:29.181 --> 22:31.767
Please tell me we are still
on the ballot.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.269
It was too late
to get us taken off, but...

22:34.352 --> 22:36.813
Raff, what are you doing?

22:36.897 --> 22:38.774
I am getting Oliver Foley
elected president

22:38.857 --> 22:40.108
of the United States
of America.

22:40.192 --> 22:42.444
We're winning
this goddamn election!

22:48.075 --> 22:49.493
That's not good.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.370
{\an8}(panting)

22:52.454 --> 22:54.998
{\an8}OLIVER:
<i>This is Homer. My dog.</i>

22:55.082 --> 22:56.291
{\an8}<i>He's a Labradoodle.</i>

22:56.375 --> 22:57.918
{\an8}<i>I've known him my whole life.</i>

22:58.001 --> 23:01.338
{\an8}<i>He's the best dog</i>
<i>in the whole wide world.</i>

23:01.421 --> 23:03.423
He's also dying.

23:03.507 --> 23:04.466
He has cancer.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.761
{\an8}A dog type of cancer
that's sort of incurable.

23:09.387 --> 23:10.972
Come on. Come over.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.849
This is my sister Lily.

23:12.933 --> 23:15.769
{\an3}And these are
my parents.

23:15.852 --> 23:17.646
It's pretty clear
I don't know nearly enough

23:17.729 --> 23:19.147
to be president alone.

23:19.231 --> 23:20.816
{\an8}But if you elect me,

23:20.899 --> 23:24.111
{\an8}I'll surround myself with
the nicest and smartest people.

23:24.194 --> 23:26.279
{\an8}I'll work so hard
to make you proud

23:26.363 --> 23:29.658
{\an8}and make sure that you can hug
your sick pets longer

23:29.741 --> 23:33.495
{\an8}and that you'll get to spend
as many healthy days as possible

23:33.578 --> 23:34.955
{\an8}with the ones you love.

23:35.038 --> 23:38.583
Because family...
family's everything.

23:56.893 --> 23:59.062
In a stunning come-
from-behind upset,

23:59.146 --> 24:02.691
11-year-old Oliver Foley
has won the Iowa caucus.

24:02.774 --> 24:06.236

24:07.779 --> 24:10.240
I mean, Oliver really
connects with people.

24:10.323 --> 24:11.741
He was the 13th story
on the news,

and together we made him
headline material.

24:14.327 --> 24:15.829

I-I think he's poised

24:15.912 --> 24:17.372

I really do.

24:17.455 --> 24:20.333
{\an3}Really? All the national polls

25:20.852 --> 25:22.771
Can't believe I get
to live here now.

25:22.854 --> 25:23.939
Well, you're in charge now,
Oliver--

25:24.022 --> 25:25.774
uh, Mr. President.

25:25.857 --> 25:26.942
You're the leader

25:27.025 --> 25:28.318
of the free world.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.154
Well... as leader
of the free world,

25:31.238 --> 25:33.657
we need to fulfill
my campaign promises.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.951
{\an3}ASAP.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.951
Absolutely.

25:36.034 --> 25:40.205
First off, free video games
for every American.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.123
Nintendo, PlayStation,

25:42.207 --> 25:43.750
whatever they want.

25:43.833 --> 25:44.793
{\an3}Um...

25:44.876 --> 25:46.544
(chuckles) Oliver...

25:46.628 --> 25:49.464
Honey, I don't think that we can
quite just do that.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.258
What are you talking about, Mom?

25:51.341 --> 25:53.009
{\an1}Well, I mean that
there are laws.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.469
{\an1}Congress.

25:54.552 --> 25:57.347
(whispering): We talked
about this, remember, honey?

25:57.430 --> 25:59.391
{\an3}But I promised
everyone video games,

25:59.474 --> 26:01.643
{\an3}and you, Mr.
Chief of Staff,

26:01.726 --> 26:03.520
{\an3}are gonna make
sure that happens.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.981
{\an3}Well, I'm not quite sure
that Congress is gonna

26:06.064 --> 26:08.275
{\an3}go for that, Mr.
President, especially

26:08.358 --> 26:10.193
{\an1}given the way the national
debt looks right now.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.320
{\an3}And plus, companies aren't
just going to willingly

26:12.404 --> 26:13.655
give away their games.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.156
Guess they'll just have to.

26:15.240 --> 26:16.616
{\an6}Yes, but...

26:15.240 --> 26:16.616
But nothing.

26:16.700 --> 26:18.326
They have to.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.036
I made a promise.

26:20.120 --> 26:24.708
So, they give away
270 million games

26:24.791 --> 26:28.670
to every American,
or we put a surcharge tax

26:28.753 --> 26:30.547
of a million dollars a Game Boy

26:30.630 --> 26:32.674
and put them out of business
in a day.

26:32.757 --> 26:37.053
The people voted. We have
to give 'em what we promised.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.184
{\an5}Hey, Oliver.

26:39.931 --> 26:43.184
Mr. President.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.145
Sorry, Raff, but it sounds
really cool.

26:45.228 --> 26:47.272
You're right.

26:47.355 --> 26:49.858
Mr. President, maybe we should,
uh, hold off

26:49.941 --> 26:52.569
on the video game thing
until you get settled in...

26:52.652 --> 26:55.655
I'm settled in, Raff,
and I know what I want.

26:55.739 --> 26:58.074
And you guys are gonna
get that done for me

26:58.158 --> 27:00.869
or I'll get <i> other</i> people
to get it done for me.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.204
There won't be a shortage
of people who want to work

27:03.288 --> 27:06.082
for the new president
of the United States.

27:08.084 --> 27:10.837
Now... where's
the White House kitchen?

27:10.920 --> 27:14.174
I want a triple-scoop
chocolate chip mint,

27:14.257 --> 27:17.177
vanilla and coffee ice cream
sundae with whipped cream,

27:17.260 --> 27:19.596
chocolate sauce and sprinkles!

27:19.679 --> 27:21.598
(door opens)

27:21.681 --> 27:22.974

27:27.562 --> 27:29.564
(chirping)

27:31.858 --> 27:33.902
{\an5}OLIVER:
I want to make a new vlog
of me singing

27:33.985 --> 27:36.404
and all these dancers around me
dressed like soldiers.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.907
Mm-hmm. I'm not sure if vlogging
is the best way to communicate.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.200
Of course it is.

27:40.283 --> 27:42.410
{\an3}I want to sing
about world peace.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.953
The lyrics should
be something like,

27:44.037 --> 27:46.081
"Either you're with peace,

27:46.164 --> 27:48.124
or you're not,"

27:48.208 --> 27:50.502
and if they're not, we start
to kill off all the dancers.

27:50.585 --> 27:51.586
{\an3}SENIOR AIDE:
Um...

27:51.669 --> 27:52.545
I mean, not for real, obviously.

27:52.629 --> 27:54.923
{\an3}But in the video,
all bloody and stuff.

27:55.006 --> 27:55.924
It'll be cool.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.635
{\an1}(barking)

27:58.718 --> 28:01.096
{\an1}Dog selection today,
Mr. President.

28:01.179 --> 28:02.305
Finally!

28:02.389 --> 28:05.642
Hi. Hello!
Oh, yes, you are so sweet.

28:05.725 --> 28:07.811
Hey, come here, come here.

28:07.894 --> 28:09.604
Okay, no. No.

28:09.687 --> 28:11.398
No. Maybe.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.982
{\an3}No.

28:13.066 --> 28:14.901
Maybe. No. (gasps)

28:14.984 --> 28:16.986
This one!
This guy right here!

28:17.070 --> 28:18.113
No, no, no, this one.

28:18.196 --> 28:21.783
He's perfect.
My new Homer.

28:21.866 --> 28:23.076
It's a female dog, sir.

28:23.159 --> 28:24.577
{\an3}What? Ew!

28:24.661 --> 28:26.121
What were you thinking?

28:26.204 --> 28:27.622
{\an5}I thought, um...

28:26.204 --> 28:27.622
Thought what?

28:27.705 --> 28:28.957
I want a new Homer!

28:29.040 --> 28:31.000
Does Homer sound like
a girl's name to you?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.794
Well, there's other
dogs here, sir.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.504
{\an3}Get rid of 'em.
I don't want 'em.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.631
Um, sir? These dogs were
selected from the pound.

28:36.714 --> 28:39.175
I don't really care.
I don't want them.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.303
{\an6}SENIOR AIDE:
Okay. It is, however,
time for your physical.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.305
Physical? No way.

28:44.389 --> 28:46.099
{\an3}Well, I'm sorry, Mr. President,
but Congress requires

28:46.182 --> 28:48.726
{\an3}that the president
get a yearly physical.

28:48.810 --> 28:49.561
Well, then fire Congress.

28:49.644 --> 28:51.855
{\an3}SENIOR AIDE:
We can't quite do that.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.064
{\an3}Well, I'm not gonna
see any doctor.

28:53.148 --> 28:54.482
Especially an old man doctor.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.109
Okay, but it's scheduled
for today, so...

28:56.192 --> 28:57.652
{\an3}Well, then
<i>un-schedule it.</i>

28:57.735 --> 28:59.904
{\an3}And never
<i>reschedule</i> it.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.158
That's the only real schedule
I can get behind.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.952
And make a new law:
no old doctors.

29:06.035 --> 29:07.287
Everyone okay with that?

29:10.748 --> 29:12.500
I said, is everyone
okay with that?

29:12.584 --> 29:14.544
Yes, Mr. President.

29:14.627 --> 29:15.753
OTHERS:
Yes, Mr. President.

29:18.131 --> 29:19.632
{\an5}Think fast! (laughs)

29:18.131 --> 29:19.632
{\an3}(grunts)

29:19.716 --> 29:22.051
{\an6}He got me.

29:19.716 --> 29:22.051
You lose, you lose.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.637
{\an6}(chuckling):
He got me.

29:22.135 --> 29:24.637
Think fast! (yells)

29:26.097 --> 29:28.183
{\an4}Mr. Chairman, Mitch.
Can...?

29:26.097 --> 29:28.183
What is it, Raff?

29:28.266 --> 29:29.684
{\an3}President wants
a military parade

29:29.767 --> 29:30.768
{\an3}for his sister's
birthday next week.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.395
{\an3}I am knee-deep in donkey
shit trying to organize it.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.814
{\an4}Right, uh,
can I...?

29:32.479 --> 29:34.814
What? Can I what?

29:35.690 --> 29:37.692
{\an4}Can I get a minute
with you?

29:35.690 --> 29:37.692
{\an3}(exhales)

29:37.775 --> 29:40.236
{\an3}What is it, Raff? You've
been out of sorts for weeks.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.529
Um...

29:41.613 --> 29:42.906
(clicks tongue)

29:45.950 --> 29:47.202
Aren't you a little worried?

29:47.285 --> 29:48.536
I'm always worried.

29:48.620 --> 29:49.996
What's your problem?

29:50.079 --> 29:51.039
{\an5}(bell ringing)

29:50.079 --> 29:51.039
{\an1}OLIVER:
Get out of the way!

29:51.122 --> 29:53.708
Mr. President coming through!
Get out of my way!

29:54.751 --> 29:57.045
{\an5}(laughing): Hey.

29:54.751 --> 29:57.045
Hey.

29:57.128 --> 29:58.213
{\an3}Choo-choo!

29:58.296 --> 29:59.797
{\an5}(women gasp)

29:58.296 --> 29:59.797
{\an3}Move it!

29:59.881 --> 30:03.051
{\an3}Hey, order pizza
for everyone.

30:03.134 --> 30:05.845
Don't you think
the president seems like a...?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.597
{\an5}A kid.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.597
Right.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.225
Like a spoiled kid. Like a...

30:11.309 --> 30:13.228
...like the most spoiled kid

30:13.311 --> 30:15.146
in the history of the world,
you know?

30:15.230 --> 30:17.232
He's commander-in-chief,
this is the greatest country

30:17.315 --> 30:18.566
in the world.
President says "Jump,"

30:18.650 --> 30:19.859
I say "How high?"

30:19.943 --> 30:21.110
{\an3}I don't care
that he's a kid.

30:21.194 --> 30:22.362
Approval rating's
through the roof,

30:22.445 --> 30:23.571
everybody loves
their video games.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.198
Strange time to be
talking treason,

30:25.281 --> 30:26.491
{\an3}Hanks.

30:26.574 --> 30:27.450
Treason?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.244
{\an5}Treason.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.244
No, I-I'm not

30:29.327 --> 30:31.204
{\an5}talking treason.
I'm, I'm not...

30:29.327 --> 30:31.204
Sure sounds like it.

30:31.287 --> 30:33.122
And I don't like it
and I won't have it.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.916
Understood?

30:34.999 --> 30:36.626
Understood.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.336
Good.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.883
(Helen speaks
indistinctly)

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
(chuckling)

30:43.967 --> 30:44.968
Helen.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.095
{\an1}Hey.

30:45.051 --> 30:47.095
{\an3}Helen.

30:47.178 --> 30:50.014
Oliver's not the president,
you are the real president.

30:50.098 --> 30:52.100
Don't you think it's time
you intervened?

30:52.183 --> 30:54.435
Intervene?

30:55.478 --> 30:57.438
{\an1}(chuckles)
Why would I do that?

30:57.522 --> 31:01.150
Raff, everything you said
would come true has.

31:01.234 --> 31:02.777
He connects with people.

31:02.860 --> 31:04.279
{\an1}My child.

31:04.362 --> 31:05.947
He touches people.

31:06.030 --> 31:09.993
Intervening's the last thing
I'm gonna do.

31:18.376 --> 31:20.461
{\an6}MAURA:
I say if it's bothering
you that much,

31:20.545 --> 31:21.713
you should just
talk with him.

31:21.796 --> 31:23.464
{\an1}RAFF:
Okay, it's just hard to know

31:23.548 --> 31:25.967
{\an1}what to say to an 11-year-old
who's also the president.

31:26.050 --> 31:27.760
{\an3}Well, you've done
pretty good thus far.

31:27.844 --> 31:29.846
{\an1}(sighs): Yeah.
It was easier before.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.808
{\an3}Listen, we're
mercenaries, right?

31:33.891 --> 31:35.852
I mean, that's what we are.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.645
{\an3}Your big mistake
was staying

31:37.729 --> 31:39.272
{\an3}with him in the
White House.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.690
{\an3}You should have
followed me.

31:40.773 --> 31:43.651
{\an3}And I moved on and
business is booming.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.279
{\an3}Didn't have to stick
around and have regrets,

31:46.362 --> 31:49.157
{\an3}see how the
sausage is made.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.825
{\an1}It's just, no one seems
to be willing

31:50.908 --> 31:52.285
{\an1}to confront him,
you know?

31:52.368 --> 31:54.162
{\an1}Even his parents
seem cowed.

31:54.245 --> 31:55.955
{\an3}Well, maybe
they are cowed.

31:56.039 --> 31:57.832
{\an3}Or maybe everyone's
okay with it.

31:57.915 --> 31:59.500
{\an3}I mean, sure, he's
a little bit bratty,

31:59.584 --> 32:01.836
but so are a lot of
kids, it's a phase.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.171
{\an3}Like your
chamomile tea phase,

32:03.254 --> 32:04.839
it's gonna pass.

32:04.922 --> 32:06.716
{\an3}Raff, you of
all people knew

32:06.799 --> 32:08.134
what you were
getting into

32:08.217 --> 32:10.219
{\an3}when you decided to
run his campaign.

32:10.303 --> 32:12.847
{\an3}Try and enjoy
this moment

32:12.930 --> 32:15.350
{\an3}instead of
worrying so much.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.018
You're the conquering hero.

32:17.101 --> 32:18.686
Right?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.648
One of the most famous
campaign managers in history.

32:21.731 --> 32:26.361
{\an3}The man who got Oliver
Foley elected president.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.866
{\an3}Thanks.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.286
<i>(Raff panting)</i>

32:35.370 --> 32:37.038
I tried to do the right thing...

32:37.121 --> 32:39.040
for once.

32:39.123 --> 32:42.043
{\an5}(loud beeping)

32:39.123 --> 32:42.043
{\an1}ORDERLY:
Mr. Hanks.

32:42.126 --> 32:44.420
We're losing him.
Get the crash cart in here.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.688
{\an3}You distracted
me, Raff.

33:01.771 --> 33:02.939
{\an1}Oh, sorry.

33:03.022 --> 33:04.232
{\an3}OLIVER:
It's okay.

33:04.315 --> 33:06.025
I never get a hole-in-one.

33:06.109 --> 33:08.111
And it sucks.

33:09.696 --> 33:10.905
Want to play?

33:10.988 --> 33:12.615
Could use the company.
My sister has homework

33:12.699 --> 33:15.076
and the Secretary
of Homeland Security

33:15.159 --> 33:16.994
sucks at golf.

33:18.996 --> 33:20.707
Um, sure, thank you.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.255
I think Nixon put
in the golf thing.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.298
{\an6}But it's so
boring, putting.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.298
Mm-hmm.

33:29.382 --> 33:31.884
{\an3}Who wants to
just putt?

33:31.968 --> 33:33.928
I want windmills
and pirate ships.

33:34.011 --> 33:35.263
{\an3}Those little pencils
to keep track.

33:35.346 --> 33:36.848
Right.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.269
(sharp exhale)

33:43.312 --> 33:45.064
{\an5}Can I speak candidly?

33:43.312 --> 33:45.064
I don't know.

33:45.148 --> 33:46.399
{\an3}Can you?

33:49.527 --> 33:52.071
Um, I'm a little worried.

33:52.155 --> 33:54.615
So am I, actually.

33:54.699 --> 33:56.743
What do you mean?

34:00.037 --> 34:01.664
{\an3}I mean...

34:01.748 --> 34:03.791
{\an3}this treason thing's
pretty serious.

34:06.043 --> 34:08.920
{\an3}You like the lighting?
I think it's cool.

34:09.005 --> 34:10.922
I'm not being
treasonous, Oliver.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.341
I'm just worried
about a few things.

34:12.425 --> 34:13.967
There is a difference.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.137
{\an5}Hit your ball, Raff.

34:14.051 --> 34:16.137
Oliver.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.513
{\an3}Putt.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.110
{\an3}Not bad.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.820
{\an3}My turn.

34:34.781 --> 34:35.782
{\an3}(grunts)

34:35.864 --> 34:37.158
Thing is, Raff...

34:37.241 --> 34:39.118
you were
my first real supporter.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.580
Hurts me that you're
not fully backing me.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.752
Fuck! I never get it in

34:47.835 --> 34:49.378
on the first try!

34:49.462 --> 34:51.589
Oliver, I do back you.

34:51.672 --> 34:53.632
{\an5}I just think that the...

34:51.672 --> 34:53.632
No.

34:53.716 --> 34:55.176
You don't get to think.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.304
You just back me.
You back me unconditionally.

34:58.387 --> 35:00.640
Whatever happened to surrounding
yourself with the greatest minds

35:00.723 --> 35:02.683
so that you could get
the most informed opinions?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.227
That was your idea.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.395
Your line in that commercial
about my dying dog.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.774
My dog's dying, Raff.

35:09.857 --> 35:11.192
He's dying.

35:11.275 --> 35:12.693
I'm such a good actor.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.154
I just pretended
Homer was dying.

35:15.238 --> 35:17.365
Just to get you
back on my team.

35:17.448 --> 35:19.534
No!

35:19.617 --> 35:21.160
I want a hole-in-one!

35:25.039 --> 35:27.458
There! Hole-in-one!
I win!

35:28.626 --> 35:30.044
That's not the way it works.

35:30.127 --> 35:32.380
It isn't?

35:32.463 --> 35:33.714
No.

35:33.798 --> 35:35.550
I said it was
a hole-in-one.

35:35.633 --> 35:36.926
And I'm president.

35:37.009 --> 35:39.720
Do you support me
or are you treasonous?

35:48.020 --> 35:50.064
I'm not treasonous, Oliver.

35:50.147 --> 35:52.859
Mr. President.

35:52.942 --> 35:56.362
"I'm not treasonous,
Mr. President."

35:59.365 --> 36:01.784
I'm not treasonous,
Mr. President.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.536
Good.

36:03.619 --> 36:06.080
So, it was a hole-in-one, right?

36:09.333 --> 36:11.627
No.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.796
No, it wasn't.

36:16.299 --> 36:19.635
It was not a hole-in-one,
Oliver.

36:26.225 --> 36:27.810
Gun!

36:27.894 --> 36:29.228
There's a gun! Shoot him.

36:35.026 --> 36:36.944
{\an5}REPORTER
<i>What do you think</i>
<i>about Raff Hanks?</i>

36:37.028 --> 36:40.448
{\an8}Oh, I think he's
the worst scum of the earth.

36:40.531 --> 36:43.242
{\an8}How dare he try and attack
that sweet little boy?

36:43.326 --> 36:45.745
{\an8}The president dodged a bullet.
Literally.

36:45.828 --> 36:46.871
{\an8}Raff Hanks got what he deserved.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.497
{\an8}He got what he deserved.

36:46.954 --> 36:48.497
{\an8}Raff Hanks got what he deserved.

36:48.581 --> 36:49.248
{\an8}Raff Hanks...

36:48.581 --> 36:49.248
{\an8}Raff Hanks...

36:49.332 --> 36:50.333
{\an8}Raff Hanks got...

36:49.332 --> 36:50.333
{\an8}...got...

36:50.416 --> 36:51.792
{\an8}<i>...got what he deserved.</i>

36:51.876 --> 36:54.253
Glad to see you awake,
Mr. Hanks.

36:54.337 --> 36:55.838
Was afraid we lost you there.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.674
{\an5}What?

36:55.922 --> 36:58.674
You need an operation

36:58.758 --> 37:00.801
on a ruptured spleen
and a punctured lung.

37:00.885 --> 37:03.930
The president has asked for
his very own doctor to help you.

37:04.013 --> 37:05.848
You're not the doctor?

37:05.932 --> 37:08.267
{\an1}The law does not permit me
to be a doctor.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.977
The doctor will be
with you shortly.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.104
(monitor beeping)

37:14.565 --> 37:16.484
All right.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.778
Let's get this done quick,
mister.

37:18.861 --> 37:20.446
No.

37:20.529 --> 37:22.657
(Raff panting)

37:22.740 --> 37:23.991
{\an3}No.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.786
I want to finish my video games.

37:26.869 --> 37:28.663
No! No!

37:28.746 --> 37:30.831
(grunting)

37:30.915 --> 37:32.959
(screaming)

37:34.919 --> 37:37.338
Society is a fragile ecosystem.

37:37.421 --> 37:41.050
Razzle and dazzle people
with the right lies

37:41.133 --> 37:43.511
and eventually they'll go blind
to the madness

37:43.594 --> 37:45.513
right in front of their faces.

37:45.596 --> 37:49.350
Raff Hanks made a living
selling the American dream.

37:49.433 --> 37:53.187
But, once sold,
he created a true nightmare

37:53.270 --> 37:55.231
that he couldn't buy back.

37:55.314 --> 37:58.317
Especially not here...

37:58.401 --> 38:00.319
in The Twilight Zone.
