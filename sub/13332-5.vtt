WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.073 --> 00:09.042
Newcastle done.

00:09.109 --> 00:11.177
Cancun done.

00:11.244 --> 00:13.079
Australia, you're getting done.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.983
The Geordies are going Down Under.
To Australia!

00:17.050 --> 00:19.986
And deep into the bush.
(all scream)

00:21.921 --> 00:24.324
Throw another shrimp on the barbie.

00:25.725 --> 00:27.527
This one's gonna be the best yet.

00:29.562 --> 00:32.131
This is a fucking war.

00:34.934 --> 00:38.371
It's the day Joel's gonna get here.
It's Joel!

00:38.438 --> 00:41.107
Fuck off. Can you not see
people are hungover?

00:41.174 --> 00:42.976
I'm here to give you a workout.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.145
He is fucking beautiful.

00:45.211 --> 00:48.014
I've flown Kate over
and I'm going away for a week.

00:48.081 --> 00:51.851
I can't wait cos me fucking balls
are like coconuts.

00:51.918 --> 00:55.088
I wish I was in James' place
cos I don't want to be here.

00:56.823 --> 00:58.992
He was devastated that
I had more girls.

01:00.560 --> 01:02.629
Tonight went from mint to shit.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.366
All you want is my sperm.
I do want a baby.

01:06.433 --> 01:08.201
Babies shouldn't have babies.

01:08.268 --> 01:10.370
We turn up in the middle of nowhere.

01:10.970 --> 01:12.972
I'm having such a good night.

01:13.673 --> 01:16.309
We're all mortal
and we're getting loved up.

01:16.376 --> 01:19.179
Roasting marshmallows on
the open fire.

01:19.245 --> 01:20.547
(yells)

01:20.613 --> 01:21.815
Hi.

01:21.881 --> 01:23.082
Stage one complete.

01:23.149 --> 01:27.454
Oh, my God.
Second stage, shag pad.

01:27.520 --> 01:30.323
Every night in Australia
is topping the previous.

01:32.959 --> 01:35.161
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:35.228 --> 01:37.363
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.766
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.601
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.903
I could talk the legs off a donkey.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.339
I'm fake, flirty and I've got FFs.

01:46.406 --> 01:48.541
The hardest graft I've done
is my hair.

01:48.608 --> 01:51.077
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:00.720 --> 02:03.089
Last night was actually
surprisingly good,

02:03.156 --> 02:05.625
sitting around the fire,
watching the stars

02:05.692 --> 02:07.627
with an old man playing the guitar.

02:07.694 --> 02:11.197
I never thought I'd have as much fun
without being in a nightclub.

02:11.264 --> 02:13.666
Nah, I feel fine.
I've woken up in the bush

02:13.733 --> 02:16.936
and it's actually not as bad as
I ever would have imagined.

02:17.003 --> 02:20.907
I'm a little bit cold and damp,
but I didn't swallow any spiders.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.543
Were you drunk last night, Holly?

02:23.610 --> 02:24.744
Yes!
She wasn't.

02:27.814 --> 02:29.115
She was smashed.

02:37.290 --> 02:40.293
Recently, Scott's behaviour has
been getting worse,

02:40.360 --> 02:42.228
especially when he's had a drink.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.397
He becomes obnoxious, inconsiderate

02:44.464 --> 02:47.600
and doesn't care about
what anyone else wants or feels.

02:52.038 --> 02:55.775
Me and Holly think it's high time
he went on a drinking ban.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.383
(phone line ringing)

03:03.449 --> 03:04.684
Hi, Mitch.

03:04.751 --> 03:06.219
I've woke up in the outback

03:06.286 --> 03:09.022
and even though I had
an amazing night last night,

03:09.088 --> 03:10.823
it's made us think about Mitch.

03:10.890 --> 03:14.561
There was loads and loads of stars
and it was just amazing.

03:14.627 --> 03:16.663
Wish you were there.

03:16.729 --> 03:19.265
I'm gonna stay now though
for the whole time.

03:19.332 --> 03:20.967
Last night I had an epiphany.

03:21.034 --> 03:24.771
I'm not leaving, I couldn't leave
this amazing experience behind.

03:24.837 --> 03:26.539
Don't know what I was thinking.

03:26.606 --> 03:28.908
OK, miss ya, care about ya,
fond of ya.

03:34.681 --> 03:38.284
Normally my morning is dying of
a hangover and going to the gym.

03:38.351 --> 03:42.589
Giving a sheep a short back and sides
is not my idea of morning glory.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.157
Morning, Bill.
Hi.

03:44.223 --> 03:47.760
Bill's telling us we're gonna shear
sheep and at first I'm like,

03:47.827 --> 03:50.930
"Yeah, buzzin'.
I've got loads of woolly jumpers."

03:50.997 --> 03:53.666
Take your pick.
You can do one with a rough neck.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.401
Get the nice round fat one.

03:55.468 --> 03:59.505
I wouldn't even give one of my mates
a haircut never mind a sheep.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.841
I'm here to bang birds
not shave sheep.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.744
I just don't understand
when I'm ever gonna use

04:04.811 --> 04:06.446
the skill of sheep shearing.

04:06.512 --> 04:09.749
I learnt maths in school and I've
never once used it outside.

04:12.518 --> 04:16.221
I'm looking at the sheep and
at the way Bill's holding it

04:16.289 --> 04:19.058
and I'm thinking,
"Shit, this is horrible."

04:19.125 --> 04:20.726
I feel so sorry for the sheep.

04:20.793 --> 04:24.263
It's like us pinning Holly down
and shaving her purple head off

04:24.330 --> 04:27.066
and her being bald.
(Bill) No-one having a go?

04:27.133 --> 04:29.969
Everyone's being
a great big sheep's vagina.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.572
I'm really sorry, Mr Sheep.

04:32.639 --> 04:36.075
It's only a sheep,
just shave the fucker.

04:38.811 --> 04:42.315
Aw, it's shit himself now.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.866
What do you think
everyone else is doing?

04:59.932 --> 05:02.769
Fuck knows.
I'm proper buzzing, me.

05:02.835 --> 05:06.372
While we're off to the beach,
the others are stuck in the outback.

05:06.439 --> 05:09.509
Probably eating each other's shit
so they can survive.

05:19.285 --> 05:22.221
James is saying he's not
gonna bring Kate in the house

05:22.288 --> 05:23.623
and that's gonna be hard

05:23.690 --> 05:27.427
because he's gotta keep this life
and his and Kate's life separate

05:27.493 --> 05:29.629
because Kate and Holly don't get on.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.837
(laughs)
I've just realised where we are.

05:37.904 --> 05:39.872
(Joel) Where?
(laughs)

05:41.874 --> 05:45.712
Oh, my God. It's a nude beach.
(laughs)

05:46.512 --> 05:52.385
So we arrive at the beach and it
turns out to be a nudist beach.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.624
I don't know if it's ready
for Poseidon and his trident.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.093
(all gasp)

06:02.962 --> 06:06.199
I hope there's not more.
They're fucking everywhere, man.

06:06.265 --> 06:09.502
There's wrinkly cocks and fannies
all over the place.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.805
God, it's like a big prune fest.
Penis!

06:12.872 --> 06:15.708
Oh, my God. His legs are wide open.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.144
Tanning your cock.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.981
I get to this beach thinking there's
gonna be loads of fit naked birds

06:22.048 --> 06:24.884
but instead I feel like I'm at
the Antiques Roadshow.

06:24.951 --> 06:27.253
There's shrivelled cocks
and saggy tits,

06:27.320 --> 06:28.921
and that's Joel and Sophie.

06:32.358 --> 06:34.293
Oh, yeah. What, with me flaps out?

06:34.360 --> 06:36.095
So Sophie decides to be shy now.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.331
Hold on,
we've seen your fanny and tits.

06:39.932 --> 06:43.102
Women are looking at ya.
I feel really awful.

06:43.169 --> 06:45.938
Me and Joel drop our pants,
in the water,

06:46.005 --> 06:48.307
it's fucking freezing,
me balls have gone.

06:52.712 --> 06:53.846
Erm...

06:56.549 --> 07:00.520
Me and Joel are doing a free
striptease for an 80th birthday.

07:00.586 --> 07:04.757
Me balls are gonna drop off.
I'm looking at 'em, I'm thinking,

07:04.824 --> 07:05.892
"Is this normal?"

07:05.958 --> 07:10.129
Wants to be next to me.
Scott, it's your birthday this week.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.798
Aye, Friday.

07:18.304 --> 07:19.338
Yeah.

07:19.405 --> 07:23.009
Everyone thinks I'm the angriest
just cos I've been angry twice.

07:23.075 --> 07:25.178
They're used to me being fluffy.

07:25.244 --> 07:27.380
You've been getting angry.

07:27.446 --> 07:31.050
Do you think it's the drink
that's probably making it worse?

07:31.117 --> 07:33.386
Trying to have
a conversation with Scott

07:33.452 --> 07:36.856
about how he's been kicking off,
punching things

07:36.923 --> 07:38.457
and getting really angry,

07:38.524 --> 07:41.694
and he thinks he should lay off
the drink till his birthday.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.862
It does help.

07:42.929 --> 07:46.165
Holly had a couple days off
and she stopped getting angry.

07:46.232 --> 07:50.203
It's hard to take him seriously
when I'm looking at his arsehole.

07:56.075 --> 07:58.277
We're going horse riding,
I'm buzzing.

07:58.344 --> 08:01.447
It's a nice view, isn't it?
Yeah, it's good.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.050
Now everything's OK with
Charlotte and Gary,

08:04.116 --> 08:07.053
it's like we can
all build friendships with him

08:07.119 --> 08:10.256
instead of feeling like
we're disrespecting Charlotte

08:10.323 --> 08:15.461
by speaking to him.
Hurry up, I wanna get on a horse.

08:15.528 --> 08:17.496
I've done it before, it was OK.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.599
It's just cos I've had an operation

08:19.665 --> 08:22.134
so I can't do anything
that goes like this.

08:22.201 --> 08:24.804
I'd rather have mint tits
than ride a horse.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.573
Wouldn't want to put
a helmet on that hair.

08:27.640 --> 08:31.878
Unless Holly can suck it off or
drink it, she doesn't wanna do it.

08:31.944 --> 08:35.748
I'm so scared.
Stay still, please don't move.

08:35.815 --> 08:38.017
What the fuck was that?
It's hilarious.

08:38.083 --> 08:42.221
Gary's out of his comfort zone.
He's so scared of this horse.

08:42.288 --> 08:43.655
Oh, my God.
Freak.

08:43.722 --> 08:48.060
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Come on.

08:48.127 --> 08:52.331
I'm good at horse riding cos I'm
generally good at riding anything.

08:52.398 --> 08:56.469
Cock, vibrators, bikes.

08:57.570 --> 09:00.373
Why the fuck have I got
a fucking midget horse?!

09:00.439 --> 09:02.708
Mine looks like it's built
for a Borrower!

09:07.079 --> 09:09.548
I'm galloping through the fields
on my horse

09:09.615 --> 09:13.019
and I look over at Gary and looks
pathetic and ugly,

09:13.085 --> 09:15.521
I don't know
what I ever saw in him.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.324
It seems a bit bittersweet to me

09:18.391 --> 09:21.727
that Charlotte spent all these years
being in love with Gaz,

09:21.794 --> 09:26.132
and now finally that she's over him,
he's chasing after her. Sod's law.

09:28.167 --> 09:31.804
Nobody told me when a horse trots,
you're meant to go with the horse,

09:31.871 --> 09:33.906
all I know is my balls are...
(mumbles)

09:44.483 --> 09:45.651
Here we are.

09:45.718 --> 09:49.588
Me and Joel have always been
spontaneous in our relationship,

09:49.655 --> 09:51.924
especially in the sexual area.

09:54.760 --> 09:58.097
I'm bored of using vibrators,
I'm bored of using cock rings,

09:58.164 --> 10:01.000
what I wanna get is bondage shit.

10:01.067 --> 10:04.570
Now, that is what I'm talking about.

10:06.806 --> 10:08.374
Now...
(growls)

10:08.441 --> 10:10.776
...do us.
Does this turn you on?

10:10.843 --> 10:13.646
Do I look sexy to you?
Well, it doesn't turn us off.

10:13.713 --> 10:17.683
Come on, let's pretend.
What would your dad say?

10:17.750 --> 10:20.686
The last thing that I wanna hear
whilst in a sex shop,

10:20.753 --> 10:25.424
surrounded by vibrators and bondage
is the word "dad".

10:26.359 --> 10:28.361
Get it off, man.

10:37.570 --> 10:39.372
The outback's been incredible.

10:39.438 --> 10:42.475
We've experienced things
I never thought I'd do.

10:47.613 --> 10:51.417
We're on our way back and the bush
and the outback has made me realise

10:51.484 --> 10:54.120
that I wanna make
the most of this experience.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.126
It was wicked,
I got to bond with the girls,

11:00.192 --> 11:01.927
I was away from Scott for a bit.

11:10.169 --> 11:11.804
Probably bossed them around.

11:11.871 --> 11:14.774
Probably had a wank
to his picture of Gary.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.943
I've learned you've got to keep
the girls on your side

11:18.010 --> 11:21.680
and Scott hasn't grasped that.
If not, they'll have your life.

11:21.747 --> 11:24.650
Let's get smashed.
Get mortal!

11:31.090 --> 11:35.528
The only way he's not gonna pull
is if we actually stop him.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.696
Operation cockblock.

11:37.763 --> 11:41.133
The anger management woman is here
for one person only.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.702
Scott, it seems your name
comes up most often.

11:43.769 --> 11:45.371
I'm not fucking angry. Smack.

11:47.773 --> 11:49.341
Whoops, sorry.

11:49.408 --> 11:51.744
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:54.146 --> 11:54.346
.

11:56.882 --> 11:57.083
.

12:11.330 --> 12:15.034
The guys get back from the outback
and I'm so glad to see everyone.

12:16.802 --> 12:21.707
I've come here in the spirit of
honesty, the spirit of friendship.

12:21.774 --> 12:23.309
What?
I've come to join her.

12:23.375 --> 12:25.678
Holly's come for moral support.
What?

12:25.744 --> 12:30.449
Right, you know we all love ya,
but you're getting on people's tits.

12:30.516 --> 12:32.051
Oh, I know. (chuckles)

12:32.118 --> 12:35.054
You have to stop with
this house smashing thing.

12:35.121 --> 12:37.923
Recently,
Scott's been getting so drunk,

12:37.990 --> 12:41.160
he's kind of lost respect
for this whole family thing

12:41.227 --> 12:43.662
and started punching walls
in our house

12:43.729 --> 12:46.365
and just pulling girls
left, right and centre

12:46.432 --> 12:50.069
and not giving a fuck about us.
I know I'm a fine one to talk.

12:50.136 --> 12:54.306
That's why I've said I'm not gonna
drink till my birthday.

12:54.373 --> 12:57.109
That's good,
cos we were gonna put you on a ban.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.879
Scott's been acting like
a massive fucking sac

12:59.945 --> 13:02.214
all because
he's been drinking too much.

13:02.281 --> 13:06.485
We've put him on a drinking ban,
get the old Scott back.

13:06.552 --> 13:10.189
We do wanna get fun Scott back,
and who's not obsessed with girls,

13:10.256 --> 13:13.125
cos you're a lot nicer
when you're not as drunk

13:13.192 --> 13:15.895
and not just having
your life revolve around them.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.198
It's in mine and Gaz's best interest
to keep the girls sweet

13:19.265 --> 13:21.600
otherwise they will make life hell.

13:25.471 --> 13:26.906
(laughs)

13:30.409 --> 13:33.946
I'm gonna stay now.
You're gonna stay till the end?

13:34.013 --> 13:36.782
The end.
Buzzin', I'm so happy.

13:36.849 --> 13:39.251
I don't know what happened
in the outback

13:39.318 --> 13:41.720
but Charlotte's came back
like a new woman.

13:41.787 --> 13:44.657
She's happy again,
and she's back to her old self.

13:44.723 --> 13:46.926
Did you chat to Gary as well?

13:46.992 --> 13:49.295
I didn't have
one conversation with him.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.663
Did you not?
No.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.265
I was so worried
coming back into this house

13:53.332 --> 13:56.168
with everything that had happened
last time,

13:56.235 --> 13:59.638
but then I realised I can't give up
this experience for a boy.

13:59.705 --> 14:03.209
I think he thinks we're gonna be
really good friends again

14:03.275 --> 14:07.479
but that'll never really happen.
Gary's got no control now.

14:07.546 --> 14:10.282
She is happy with someone else,
not him.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.519
I just told him to
not make it awkward for anyone else.

14:17.823 --> 14:19.391
(all cheer)

14:20.593 --> 14:24.396
Tonight we're hitting Scary Canary
and I've got a hairy fairy.

14:24.463 --> 14:26.966
Bring it on!
(all cheer)

14:28.767 --> 14:31.437
I'm back in Sydney
and I wanna go out and tash on

14:31.503 --> 14:33.772
so we've decided to have
"family night".

14:33.839 --> 14:35.975
Let's see how long
that fucking lasts.

14:39.311 --> 14:42.248
So, Scott's on a drinking ban
which we've put him on

14:42.314 --> 14:46.518
and I think tonight we'll hopefully
see what the old Scott was like.

14:50.155 --> 14:53.425
Me and Gaz have decided we're not
gonna bring any girls back

14:53.492 --> 14:56.528
because we're gonna have
family time when we get back.

15:02.801 --> 15:06.372
The last person I expected to be
wearing my top is Charlotte.

15:13.145 --> 15:16.849
Gary's trying his best to try and
talk to us and have a laugh with us.

15:16.915 --> 15:20.119
I'm just humouring Gary,
I'm not really his friend,

15:20.185 --> 15:23.589
but I'll pretend if it means
the dickhead will leave us alone.

15:29.094 --> 15:30.562
Whoops, sorry(!)

15:30.629 --> 15:34.066
Didn't realise I just high-fived
your broken hand(!)

15:34.133 --> 15:36.635
(laughs)

15:40.906 --> 15:45.811
As predicted, Scott has ignored
our pleas, advice, and orders.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.948
All we want Scott to do is
actually wanna spend time with us,

15:50.015 --> 15:53.886
rather than five minutes then
brushing us off for random girls.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.688
We're fucking sick of it.

15:55.754 --> 15:59.558
The only way he's not gonna pull
is if we actually stop him.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.162
So there's only one thing for it.
Operation Cockblock.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.201
Basically, it involves us ladies

16:09.268 --> 16:12.438
making sure Scott gets
absolutely zero vagina.

16:22.815 --> 16:25.584
No matter how many times we say
it's family night,

16:25.651 --> 16:28.854
we'll always see him talk to
a girl, necking on with a girl,

16:28.921 --> 16:32.224
prancing around a girl like
a little fairy with twinkle toes.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.729
Us girls are
the experts in cockblocking,

16:36.795 --> 16:39.565
like we're the owners of
the cockblocking empire.

16:45.003 --> 16:47.239
This is a covert operation

16:47.306 --> 16:50.809
that can be pulled off with
stealth and exceptional precision.

16:50.876 --> 16:54.513
Actually, it's just us talking to
the lasses Scott's trying to pull.

17:09.962 --> 17:13.598
I think Scott just thinks we're
just being dead nice to these girls

17:13.665 --> 17:15.634
and he thinks it's a good thing.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.904
I don't know what is going on

17:18.971 --> 17:22.107
but for once they're being
proper friendly. Buzzing.

17:24.510 --> 17:27.012
Scott, bless him,
thinks he's on cloud nine,

17:27.079 --> 17:30.249
he actually thinks our girls are
being nice to the birds.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.117
You are getting cockblocked.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.621
He's like a meerkat
bouncing up and down

17:35.687 --> 17:40.726
trying to see what we're doing
but he just doesn't understand.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.398
The lads aren't bringing
any girls back to the house tonight.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.535
(laughs evilly)

18:09.721 --> 18:12.057
Yeah, man.
I'm fresh as fuck this morning.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.026
Gym time, baby.

18:14.092 --> 18:17.529
We wake up and Steve's organised
an anger management session.

18:17.596 --> 18:22.267
To be fair,
this has been a long time coming.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.544
What a nightmare, the gym's shut,

18:32.611 --> 18:35.247
so Billy and Terry
aren't gonna get a workout.

18:41.687 --> 18:43.689
I've seen what's happened to James,

18:43.755 --> 18:46.425
there's nee chance I'd get in
a relationship.

18:53.966 --> 18:57.302
One thing me and James have in common
is Holly and Charlotte.

18:57.369 --> 19:00.405
He had the same thing with Holly
as I did with Charlotte.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.308
But now me and James
haven't got anything in common.

19:16.588 --> 19:18.657
So the anger management woman
is here

19:18.724 --> 19:22.127
and I lead her to where
the anger circulates.

19:22.194 --> 19:23.428
The sitting room.

19:23.495 --> 19:26.131
Hiya. You all right?

19:26.198 --> 19:28.600
The anger management counsellor
walks in,

19:28.667 --> 19:30.769
she's 4'0" and seven stone wet.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.171
What the fuck's she gonna do
if it kicks off?

19:33.238 --> 19:34.573
I don't need to stay long

19:34.640 --> 19:37.342
cos there won't be that
much anger to talk about?

19:37.409 --> 19:40.812
Yes, so much anger.
So much anger, wow.

19:40.879 --> 19:43.282
So yes, there's a lot,
no, there's not.

19:43.348 --> 19:47.019
You wanna tell me what's going on?
The boys are really angry.

19:47.085 --> 19:50.022
Scott punches walls.
All they do is punch things.

19:50.088 --> 19:51.256
Look at their hands.

19:51.323 --> 19:54.359
We've got a big issue
with the boys punching objects.

19:54.426 --> 19:57.796
Well, now I'm starting to understand
why I'm sitting here.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.733
The anger management person is here
for one person and one person only

20:01.800 --> 20:05.404
and his name is Scott. Scott, seems
your name has come up most often,

20:05.470 --> 20:09.541
can we have a chat about why
you're so angry? Is that OK?

20:09.608 --> 20:11.176
I'm not angry. Smack.

20:11.243 --> 20:16.381
I'm not that bad, it's only been on
two occasions it's happened.

20:16.448 --> 20:19.518
I see everyone in this house
angry all the time.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.688
The first time I did it
doesn't make me an angry person.

20:22.754 --> 20:26.458
First time I got angry was
because Holly was in my bed.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.493
It's not your bed.

20:28.560 --> 20:31.396
I was in a bed because I had
no other bed in the house

20:31.463 --> 20:33.599
so I went upstairs in
the shag pad room,

20:33.665 --> 20:36.768
Scott starts smashing the house up
and punching walls.

20:36.835 --> 20:40.606
I need to step in and tell this
woman everything that Scott's done.

20:40.672 --> 20:43.308
But it backfires
because I start getting angry

20:43.375 --> 20:45.777
and I'm more pissed off
then when I sat down.

20:45.844 --> 20:49.381
I said, "I've got no other bed."
You were shouting your head off.

20:49.448 --> 20:52.718
Because I had no other bed.
You're making me angry.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.653
(gasping, laughter)

20:54.720 --> 20:57.522
I know people think anger management
is a great way

20:57.589 --> 20:59.458
to get everything off your chest,

20:59.524 --> 21:05.530
but I just think it's made
everyone a hell of a lot angrier.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.200
Sophie?
Erm, I don't really get that angry.

21:08.266 --> 21:10.602
OK, but when you do,
what triggers it?

21:10.669 --> 21:12.771
Erm...

21:12.838 --> 21:15.540
The only reason why
I ever get angry with Joel

21:15.607 --> 21:18.944
is because of the past
because he was such a dick before.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.146
Jealousy.
It's usually a lot of things

21:21.213 --> 21:24.049
but see if you can come up with one.
Jealousy.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.852
Joel's acting like this is
his private session.

21:26.918 --> 21:31.256
I can see the look in Sophie's eyes,
"Shut up before you lose your balls."

21:31.323 --> 21:33.859
I get really jealous.

21:33.925 --> 21:38.296
And I get jealous over me boyfriend
when he talks to another girl.

21:38.363 --> 21:40.298
Then it comes to Charlotte's turn.

21:40.365 --> 21:44.503
It was just all really comes back
down to this one person.

21:44.569 --> 21:47.939
He was just a dick,
he's a horrible person.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.610
I think Charlotte forgets this is
not a one-on-one session

21:51.677 --> 21:53.278
and I actually am in the room.

21:53.345 --> 21:57.182
(counsellor) Is this someone you
were in a close relationship with?

21:57.249 --> 21:59.685
You could say close,
but then very far away.

21:59.751 --> 22:01.887
All this blame's getting put on me.

22:01.953 --> 22:04.756
If she wants to crawl in my bed
one night and bang us,

22:04.823 --> 22:07.059
she's got to deal with
the consequences

22:07.125 --> 22:10.128
when she knows I'll go out
and bang someone else.

22:10.195 --> 22:12.798
How do you feel about him
not being in your life?

22:12.864 --> 22:15.934
I'm absolutely over the moon,
I've never felt happier.

22:16.001 --> 22:19.938
I feel like I'm a different person.
This is the most awkward situation.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.541
But this is not the right time
to defend myself.

22:22.607 --> 22:26.478
He used to pretend he was my friend
and he used to say that he cared

22:26.545 --> 22:30.082
and he told other people things
that meant that he didn't care,

22:30.148 --> 22:32.784
so he was a liar and a bullshitter.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.920
What kept you coming back to him?

22:34.986 --> 22:39.157
Because we lived together
and there was nothing else to do.

22:39.224 --> 22:42.661
It wasn't always the sex cos
sometimes I got bored through it.

22:42.728 --> 22:43.729
Bore off.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.932
She's just griefed him
how he used to treat her like shit,

22:46.998 --> 22:50.902
doesn't care about his friends,
he doesn't care about that

22:50.969 --> 22:54.039
apart from how crap he was in bed,
which is true,

22:54.106 --> 22:57.843
he was shit, cos I seen it and
he bucks like an absolute rabbit.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.445
Are we talking about someone
who's present?

23:00.512 --> 23:02.280
Yeah.
Ah, OK.

23:02.347 --> 23:05.383
Would it be OK
if we identified the person?

23:05.450 --> 23:09.121
Yes, it was him, it was Gary.

23:09.187 --> 23:12.758
I'm so happy that I'm not in Gary's
position right now. Wicked.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.864
That's me saying I'm sorry.

23:18.930 --> 23:21.466
(laughs)

23:21.533 --> 23:24.469
Vicky is with Fit Dan
and I've got the ugly friend.

23:26.872 --> 23:31.610
There is literally five birds that
I've banged at this party.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.813
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:37.115 --> 23:37.315
.

23:39.851 --> 23:40.051
.

23:53.598 --> 23:56.268
I feel like the anger management
proper worked.

23:56.334 --> 23:58.603
I cannae wait
to go smash something up.

23:58.670 --> 24:01.973
So Vicky's suggested
we have a massive pool party,

24:02.040 --> 24:05.210
invite everyone that we've ever met,
have a silent disco

24:05.277 --> 24:08.547
and have Joel as the DJ.
That sounds like an immense party.

24:09.648 --> 24:13.652
I'm obviously gonna invite Fit Dan
to the party, he's fucking gorgeous.

24:13.718 --> 24:17.522
I'm hoping if I get him in a social
situation, we might get a tash on.

24:25.330 --> 24:27.465
After that anger management session,

24:27.532 --> 24:30.569
now is definitely the right time
to speak to Charlotte.

24:34.706 --> 24:37.375
I can still remember
when I first met Charlotte,

24:37.442 --> 24:40.579
lying in that bed and sleeping
with her for the first time

24:40.645 --> 24:43.782
and it seems weird to think back then
there was no issues,

24:43.849 --> 24:47.586
we slept with each other a lot more
and it was a perfect match ever,

24:47.652 --> 24:49.187
but feelings got involved.

24:49.254 --> 24:51.456
I just want to say...

25:04.836 --> 25:08.406
What you did to us all that time
was wrong, it was horrible.

25:08.473 --> 25:11.009
I'm saying...
Not like we tried every option.

25:11.076 --> 25:14.746
We didn't, the only option that was
ever tried was you hurting us.

25:21.319 --> 25:23.088
That's me saying sorry.

25:23.154 --> 25:25.924
I've been waiting for this apology
for so long.

25:25.991 --> 25:30.262
For him to admit he did hurt us
and he did toy with me emotions.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.797
I'll never ever forgive you
for what you did

25:32.864 --> 25:36.768
and we'll never ever be friends,
so you lost us so long ago.

25:36.835 --> 25:41.506
What me and Mitch have is completely
different to what me and Gary had.

25:41.573 --> 25:45.543
With Mitch it's real.
With Gary, it was all lies.

26:00.225 --> 26:05.297
You're definitely ringing...
Fit Dan.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.799
Me and Holly,
being the only single girls,

26:07.866 --> 26:10.201
are gonna invite lads round
for the party.

26:10.268 --> 26:13.305
As I'm dialling Fit Dan,
me fingers are trembling.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.541
Hi, is that Dan?
"Yeah."

26:16.608 --> 26:17.609
Hiya, it's Vicky.

26:19.110 --> 26:20.879
I'm fine, pet. How are you?

26:22.414 --> 26:26.084
Nothing much, we're having
a pool party/house party tonight

26:26.151 --> 26:28.086
and wondered if you wanted to come.

26:30.288 --> 26:31.890
I'm sure we'll manage, babe.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.792
(both chuckle)

26:38.730 --> 26:41.700
Sophie and Joel have
the most adventurous sex ever.

26:41.766 --> 26:45.537
What you're supposed to do with it.
Supposed to do something weird.

26:45.603 --> 26:48.306
So Charlotte reckons
she's the bondage expert.

26:48.373 --> 26:51.609
She's standing there with her hands
round a lampshade

26:51.676 --> 26:53.611
looking like she's wanking it off.

26:56.948 --> 26:58.149
(girl) "Hi..."

26:58.216 --> 27:00.585
It's voicemail,
I'll just leave a message.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.887
Me and Scott decide to ring
our own girls,

27:02.954 --> 27:04.856
to make sure I've got a dead cert.

27:04.923 --> 27:06.558
Hi, there. This is Scott.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.961
I was just wondering if you
wanted to come to a pool party?

27:10.028 --> 27:11.296
Few drinks.

27:16.735 --> 27:20.038
I can't help but think
she'll be here till the party ends.

27:26.211 --> 27:30.648
It's a silent disco. I can't wait.
I fucking love these ones.

27:32.784 --> 27:35.920
Joel on the decks,
loads of fit people coming round.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.923
But is there gonna be a kick off?
I fucking hope not.

27:41.726 --> 27:45.497
First girl comes walking through,
a bird I banged on the first night.

27:45.563 --> 27:48.867
I seen her, I was like,
"You're actually all right, come in."

27:48.933 --> 27:52.237
This is Dan, this is a pisshead.
Nice to meet you.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.540
This is Rhian.

27:55.607 --> 27:59.344
It hasn't escaped my knowledge Scott
and Gaz have a lot of girls here

27:59.411 --> 28:01.446
that they've already been through.

28:01.513 --> 28:06.184
There's literally five birds
that I've banged at this party.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.524
There's girls everywhere.

28:12.590 --> 28:16.728
One minute, I'm on the
balcony fingering someone,

28:16.795 --> 28:19.464
next I'm downstairs
with the one I wanna bang.

28:24.135 --> 28:27.238
This is literally
Operation Too Much Fanny.

28:27.839 --> 28:30.041
In the end,
I did what every lad would do,

28:30.108 --> 28:31.943
pick the fittest one
and get in bed.

28:34.479 --> 28:36.714
Lo and behold,
another girl for Gary.

28:39.117 --> 28:41.286
Gary?

28:43.354 --> 28:47.625
Maybe we should...
Maybe he's upstairs.

28:48.827 --> 28:52.597
This is most boring Geordie Shore
house party ever.

28:52.664 --> 28:55.667
I feel like it's because I'm not
shagging Gary any more

28:55.733 --> 28:58.369
and I'm not kicking off.
All I can do is sleep.

29:01.806 --> 29:04.375
I'm single, I feel like
one of the fucking lads.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.779
I've got Fit Dan here who I haven't
tashed on with but I want to

29:07.846 --> 29:10.615
and then a lad I've tashed on with,
I'm a weapon.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.655
Vicky is with Fit Dan
and I've got the ugly friend.

29:17.722 --> 29:19.757
Just my fucking luck.

29:24.762 --> 29:26.598
You do know that I like English.

29:29.367 --> 29:32.170
I've fucking done it!
I've tashed on with Fit Dan!

29:32.237 --> 29:35.106
Women everywhere,
you thought it couldn't be done,

29:35.173 --> 29:39.444
but I fucking succeeded.
Suck us off!

29:48.153 --> 29:51.689
After tonight, it's made me realise
how lucky I am to have Joel

29:51.756 --> 29:52.957
and not be single.

29:53.024 --> 29:56.528
The last thing I would want to do
is go round chasing the cock,

29:56.594 --> 29:59.063
talking about the cock,
kissing the cock

29:59.130 --> 30:01.065
and looking like a complete slag.

30:05.503 --> 30:09.374
Somehow I've been left alone
in a room with Dan's friend

30:09.440 --> 30:12.143
and now he's naked
and now I don't know what to do

30:12.210 --> 30:15.413
because I'm scared of his cock
because it's not familiar.

30:15.480 --> 30:16.548
(laughs)

30:16.614 --> 30:20.451
I've got major, major cock fright
and he needs to leave now.

30:21.386 --> 30:23.087
Just familiar cock from now on.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.660
I'm in bed with the fittest bird,

30:28.726 --> 30:32.063
the others have gone without
ripping each other's hair out,

30:32.130 --> 30:34.566
I think our house party curse
has been broken

30:34.632 --> 30:36.668
cos me and Charlotte
aren't banging.

30:40.605 --> 30:43.174
(laughs)

30:48.479 --> 30:49.881
I'm lying in bed with a man

30:49.948 --> 30:55.320
who looks like he's been carved
by angels. Fucking get in.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.825
Oh, my God! I feel sorry for
the predicament James is in.

31:00.892 --> 31:03.127
Me and Charlotte are
coming to terms with

31:03.194 --> 31:06.531
we're friends without flirting.
It's harder than we thought.

31:07.732 --> 31:09.968
Happy birthday to Scotty T.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.303
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:14.806 --> 31:15.006
.

31:17.508 --> 31:17.709
.

31:33.157 --> 31:35.526
So, last night
the party was pretty average

31:35.593 --> 31:39.464
but at least there was no kick-offs
and once again Scott and Gaz pulled

31:39.530 --> 31:41.866
so I bet it was great for them.

31:44.335 --> 31:46.371
Last night I was mortal.

31:46.437 --> 31:49.907
I got that kind of drunk where
you feel like you're really sexy.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.776
I thought I was in The Saturdays.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.780
I just want Dan out the house.

31:55.847 --> 31:58.082
It's nothing to do with him,
it's me.

31:58.149 --> 32:01.986
I just feel dirty and I can't wait
to just get rid of him.

32:02.053 --> 32:07.525
I don't know how Gary and Scott
do this all the time.

32:12.730 --> 32:15.667
I woke up this morning
and my hand is fucking killing.

32:15.733 --> 32:19.003
I forgot I've got a bad hand
and should've been using my left

32:19.070 --> 32:23.041
but instead I was fingering birds
with a fractured fucking bone.

32:23.107 --> 32:28.713
Today is Scott's birthday and I've
got the best surprise for him ever.

32:29.847 --> 32:34.319
I'm buzzing to dive out this plane
but Gaz is shitting his pants.

32:45.196 --> 32:48.800
Oh, my God. What the hell?!

32:48.866 --> 32:52.570
Hi!
We were just talking about ya.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.205
Hopefully something nice.

32:57.208 --> 32:59.644
Course I'm gonna come back.

32:59.711 --> 33:02.180
I've had an amazing time
away with Kate,

33:02.246 --> 33:03.881
it couldn't have been better.

33:03.948 --> 33:07.719
It is hard being in a relationship
on the other side of the world.

33:07.785 --> 33:10.588
I thought you were gonna come
last night with Kate.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.626
It would have been good,
but in time.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.796
Genuinely, I feel sorry for
the predicament James is in.

33:18.863 --> 33:22.767
He should bring Kate into the house
but that'll cause confrontation.

33:22.834 --> 33:26.437
Wooo! Did you have a good time?
It's been amazing, like.

33:26.504 --> 33:30.375
So, James has come back from a week
of swanning off with his girlfriend.

33:30.441 --> 33:33.778
I'm like, "Great, all right for you,
we've been stuck at work

33:33.845 --> 33:36.948
and in the outback and shit."
Why don't we get nice treats?

33:37.014 --> 33:40.852
James could go out with Cheryl Cole
and Holly would say, "She's a slag."

33:40.918 --> 33:42.887
I've broke a nail.

33:42.954 --> 33:46.557
The lads are out at the minute, but
I can't wait for them to get back

33:46.624 --> 33:50.361
and tell us about all
the unreal birds they've banged.

33:57.802 --> 34:00.805
I'm about to launch myself
out this plane at 14,000ft.

34:00.872 --> 34:05.476
The only thing better would be
a bird sucking us off in the air.

34:05.543 --> 34:09.045
Fuck all this competition banter
and fuck arguing over birds.

34:09.112 --> 34:12.116
This is a fresh start and we
need to get back in having fun.

34:16.187 --> 34:20.324
This is the biggest rush ever,
happy birthday to Scotty T.

34:29.333 --> 34:33.504
I just hope the girls let him be,
let him drink and enjoy his birthday.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.206
Happy fucking birthday.
Buzzin'.

34:38.042 --> 34:42.246
Barbecue, beach, booze,
birthday, bicep.

34:51.656 --> 34:56.127
I have gone from hating Joel with
every inch of fibre of my being.

34:56.194 --> 34:58.629
I viewed him as nothing more
than a bell-end

34:58.696 --> 35:01.933
who wore too much fake tan
and lipstick, and now look at us.

35:01.999 --> 35:04.101
Hug it out.
What the fuck?

35:04.168 --> 35:05.970
Vicky's a new woman.

35:06.037 --> 35:09.207
(cheering)

35:11.242 --> 35:13.077
Everyone's buzzing to see Scott

35:13.144 --> 35:16.347
but the reason he's getting
a light run is it's his birthday.

35:16.414 --> 35:19.116
Happy birthday.
We went skydiving this morning.

35:19.183 --> 35:20.918
Nice hair.

35:20.985 --> 35:24.989
Skydiving? Stop lying, you've been
sucking each other off all day.

35:25.056 --> 35:30.228
Eat it while you can,
just put your face in it.

35:30.294 --> 35:35.266
Happy birthday, Scott.
Love youse all.

35:35.333 --> 35:38.603
(cheering, laughter)

35:39.570 --> 35:43.341
We're laughing, pushing each other
over, and it's so much fun

35:43.407 --> 35:47.245
and I'm starting to think, are we
all beginning to like each other?

35:59.390 --> 36:03.294
This birthday's unreal,
everyone is in a class mood

36:03.361 --> 36:05.596
and I can't wait to get
stuck into drink.

36:16.374 --> 36:20.344
I don't even wanna go to work, man.

36:20.411 --> 36:23.915
Get on with it, and before
you know it, you'll be back out.

36:26.083 --> 36:30.488
The classic birthday preparations
for a Geordie are a swift workout,

36:30.555 --> 36:33.824
a shit, a shower, a shave
and a fucking shuffle.

36:37.695 --> 36:40.598
I just realised I've got
to go to work with Charlotte.

36:40.665 --> 36:42.867
It's Scott's birthday. Gutted.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.481
Me and Gary have nothing
to talk about any more,

36:57.548 --> 37:01.485
we've got nothing in common
and nothing that we agree on.

37:01.552 --> 37:03.588
So nothing has to be said.

37:07.625 --> 37:09.093
Fuck.

37:12.096 --> 37:16.367
Thank fuck this awkward silence is
over, the party people are here.

37:16.434 --> 37:21.572
Is everyone having a good night?!
(cheering)

37:21.639 --> 37:25.776
I know that everyone else knows now
that I'm over Gary,

37:25.843 --> 37:28.613
but I can't help but think
Gary still thinks

37:28.679 --> 37:30.615
he's got some kind of power over us.

37:30.681 --> 37:32.984
I'll show you that
I haven't any more, Gary.

37:33.050 --> 37:35.052
Who wants to kiss Gary?

37:40.625 --> 37:43.628
In a way, I think Charlotte is
trying too hard

37:43.694 --> 37:45.329
to convince me she's moved on.

37:47.164 --> 37:50.801
Just by the look on Gary's face
makes us laugh inside,

37:50.868 --> 37:55.439
makes us think, "Told you,
you fucking stupid prick."

37:55.506 --> 37:59.210
Now go kiss someone else cos
I'm happy to watch, I don't care.

38:15.192 --> 38:17.962
(Sophie) To the family!
(all cheer)

38:18.029 --> 38:19.497
We all arrive at the club,

38:19.563 --> 38:23.401
music's wicked, atmosphere's
incredible, everything's going off.

38:23.467 --> 38:26.437
We're gonna get smashed
cos it's Scotty T's birthday.

38:36.347 --> 38:40.251
Tonight Scott's decided it's his
birthday and we're not gonna pull.

38:43.254 --> 38:45.923
Me and Holly seem to have
switched roles.

38:45.990 --> 38:49.627
All of a sudden, I'm out,
I'm tashing on, having a laugh

38:49.694 --> 38:51.962
and Holly's afraid of a little cock.

38:56.367 --> 38:59.503
I can't wing-woman Vicky,
I just can't do it.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.639
She's gonna have to
take two on her own.

39:04.809 --> 39:08.212
I am absolutely mortal
and I'm proud of meself

39:08.279 --> 39:11.549
because for once I am in a worse
state than everyone else here.

39:14.652 --> 39:19.290
Sophie and Joel are mortal
and are giving us a live sex show.

39:19.356 --> 39:23.627
Fucking disgusting,
you set of scruffy pricks.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.664
Everyone knows
how drunk Joel can get,

39:26.731 --> 39:28.532
so I want to be in the same state

39:28.599 --> 39:31.135
and piss meself
and also be sick on meself.

39:35.473 --> 39:38.609
I think someone needs to call
Sophie and Joel a taxi home

39:38.676 --> 39:41.879
cos I think any minute,
they'll start shagging in the club.

39:49.086 --> 39:50.988
I've had a mint birthday.

39:51.055 --> 39:54.625
Who needs to go out and pull birds
when I've got a family like this?

39:56.227 --> 40:00.064
I'm gradually turning back
into the me I was proud of.

40:00.131 --> 40:03.000
I'm feeling stronger,
I'm feeling more confident,

40:03.067 --> 40:05.169
I'm feeling like me old self again.

40:06.670 --> 40:10.407
Vicky took the piss and she pulled,
she will not get away with it.

40:26.290 --> 40:29.860
We all get back to the house
absolutely mortal.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.095
Standard craic,

40:31.162 --> 40:34.532
we decide to dress up in
Sophie and Joel's bondage gear.

40:36.167 --> 40:40.037
Scott has had it too easy
for his birthday, get this mask on,

40:40.104 --> 40:42.606
I'm gonna handcuff you to the piano.

40:47.812 --> 40:50.815
Scott dressed up as a gimp,
nowt new.

40:50.881 --> 40:52.683
But I can see it's turning Gaz on.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.588
They're trying to handcuff me
to the piano.

40:57.655 --> 40:59.657
Howay.
Have you seen the size of us?

40:59.723 --> 41:02.226
I'll smash it to bits,
Beethoven, suck us off.

41:07.431 --> 41:10.367
Scott's kicking off
and smashing the house up again.

41:10.434 --> 41:13.838
This must be what happens when
you send too much time with Gaz.

41:13.904 --> 41:16.073
He's turned into the new Charlotte.

41:19.944 --> 41:23.180
Yet again, Scott has smashed
another thing when he's pissed

41:23.247 --> 41:24.715
when will he learn?

41:32.523 --> 41:35.326
Scott's had a mint birthday
so the icing on the cake

41:35.392 --> 41:38.629
is spending time with Gaz
with a bit of bondage.

41:38.696 --> 41:41.832
I like it.
He likes it.

41:42.566 --> 41:44.869
Aw, how romantic.

41:45.836 --> 41:48.439
Love the family,
I've had an amazing birthday

41:48.505 --> 41:51.842
but there's a queue of girls
waiting to suck me off tomorrow.

41:54.411 --> 41:56.413
Me and Joel have had
such a good night

41:56.480 --> 41:58.249
and we get into bed together

41:58.315 --> 42:02.086
and once again, we are too fucked
to even have sex.

42:02.152 --> 42:03.821
What is going on?

42:03.888 --> 42:07.091
My vagina may as well be
sewed up right now

42:07.157 --> 42:08.893
and have cobwebs all over it.

42:11.495 --> 42:14.198
Scott's birthday
couldn't have been any better

42:14.265 --> 42:17.501
but right at the last minute
he has to go smash the piano up,

42:17.568 --> 42:21.472
too pissed, spoilt it.
Night-night.

42:23.707 --> 42:27.044
I'm so dangerous.
I could do better meself!

42:27.111 --> 42:29.480
Step back, I may harm you!

42:29.546 --> 42:31.949
It's dark, it's raining.

42:32.016 --> 42:36.420
I see all the bed posts shaking.
Fuck me, this is scary.

42:36.487 --> 42:39.823
Fuck. Youse are really starting
to piss me frigging off.

42:39.890 --> 42:42.359
Yes! I get to go home.

42:42.426 --> 42:44.561
It's fucking Fit Dan from the gym.

42:44.628 --> 42:49.667
The topic of conversation that comes
to my head first is dogs bollocks.

42:50.868 --> 42:53.938
Playing with one,
banging the other, amazing.

42:54.004 --> 42:56.974
Gary, you all right up there?
(moaning)

42:57.041 --> 42:59.476
How's cock-a-tron?

42:59.543 --> 43:03.247
Scott's cock accidentally
falls into my mouth. (laughter)

43:28.105 --> 43:28.305
