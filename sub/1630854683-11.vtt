Happy birthday, khia!

00:15.850 --> 00:17.649
Wait. Why are
you already awake?!

00:17.718 --> 00:21.920
Because you guys wake me up at
3:19 on my birthday every year

00:21.922 --> 00:23.655
And it is terrifying.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.658
So, I decided to skip
the heart attack this time.

00:26.660 --> 00:28.060
How else are we supposed
to celebrate your birthday

00:28.062 --> 00:29.461
Down to the exact minute?

00:29.596 --> 00:31.529
Maybe you could just not.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.331
Absurd.
It's a pham fam tradition.

00:33.367 --> 00:34.466
- Alright.
- Yeah.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.101
Ow. Ow.

Cheese.

Khia, the traditional
recounting of the birth

00:46.847 --> 00:50.148
Must occur at the exact
anniversary of said birth,

00:50.217 --> 00:51.683

Fine,

00:53.987 --> 00:58.223
Okay.
Let me take you back 16 years.

00:58.292 --> 01:00.559
I was eight days overdue.

01:00.628 --> 01:02.827
I was cranky af.

01:02.863 --> 01:05.230
And your dad was
at the grocery store

01:05.232 --> 01:06.765
When I lost
my mucous plug.

01:06.900 --> 01:07.832
Oh, mom!

01:07.868 --> 01:09.501
How does the story get grosser

01:09.537 --> 01:11.036
Every time you tell it?!

Wait until you hear the part
about me pooping on the doctor.

01:13.707 --> 01:15.006
Oh, it's true. She did.

01:15.076 --> 01:16.175
And so did you, actually.

01:17.511 --> 01:20.111
So, we were on
our way to the hospital

01:20.147 --> 01:22.247
And there was so much traffic.

01:23.384 --> 01:26.051

01:26.053 --> 01:28.320
Aw, hell yeah! Leo!

01:53.481 --> 01:54.813
Before I put you on the streets,

01:54.948 --> 01:57.015
I gotta teach you
about the streets.

01:57.084 --> 01:58.883
Of rockridge?

01:58.919 --> 02:00.752
I'm not sure if you're aware,

(whispering)
asian drivers.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.492
Yes, you've mentioned it
a few times.

02:07.528 --> 02:10.094
I've spent my whole life trying
to prove those stereotypes wrong

02:10.131 --> 02:13.097
And avoid all the racist crap
I saw my parents put up with,

02:13.134 --> 02:14.700
Especially on the road.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.636
Okay, but your mom
is actually a bad driver.

You'll likely
encounter on the road.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.711
First step,
you gotta knock on the hood--

04:39.747 --> 04:41.446
(knocking)

04:41.515 --> 04:43.848
--To make sure there's no cats
hiding in the undercarriage.

04:43.917 --> 04:46.718
Cats! That's why you do that!

04:46.787 --> 04:47.953
Yeah, they like to curl
up there to stay warm

04:47.955 --> 04:50.455
But if you start the car--
(meowing)

04:50.491 --> 04:51.923
(whispering)
cat murderer.

04:51.925 --> 04:52.890
Oh, god.

04:52.926 --> 04:54.793
Violent... Okay.

04:54.862 --> 04:56.861
Cat check.
(knocking)

04:56.930 --> 04:58.463
Check.

04:58.532 --> 05:01.599
Next, we gotta make sure your
tail pipe is clear of bananas.

05:01.669 --> 05:02.633
What?

Leo: Part-time nun pulls out

Sam, I am so glad
you could hang out.

05:35.736 --> 05:38.770
There are not a lot of moms
our age in this industry.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.506
It's just so nice that
we don't have to explain

05:41.542 --> 05:42.574
Everything to each other.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.543
Yeah. Exactly.

05:44.678 --> 05:47.712
Hey, I heard your firm just
landed that big telecom account.

05:47.715 --> 05:50.315

05:55.188 --> 05:58.189
Um, just freelancing mostly.

05:58.225 --> 06:01.593

(chuckling)

06:01.728 --> 06:03.194
That is so nice.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.195
And you're how old?

06:04.231 --> 06:06.330
Twelve. Skipped a few grades

06:06.367 --> 06:08.600
'cause my iq is off the charts.

06:08.602 --> 06:12.003
They actually studied me
to make a new chart.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.605
Oh, wow!

06:13.740 --> 06:15.941
Your mom
must be so proud.

06:16.076 --> 06:17.876
Are you, mother?

06:17.945 --> 06:20.845
Mm! Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

06:22.816 --> 06:24.682
Fasten your seatbelt,
depress the brake,

06:24.718 --> 06:26.952
Press the button,
release the parking brake,

06:26.954 --> 06:28.854
Check your rear-view mirror,
your side mirror,

06:28.989 --> 06:31.423
Check your blind spots, check
your rear-view mirror again.

06:31.425 --> 06:33.391
Then, and only then
may you gradually

06:33.526 --> 06:35.560
And slowly ease
into the roadway.

06:35.629 --> 06:37.495
Okay, but you're not
going to do the whole rigmarole

06:37.531 --> 06:39.030
Every single time you drive!

06:39.032 --> 06:40.498
I do!

06:40.534 --> 06:41.633
Well, what if you're trying
to escape a hoard of zombies?!

06:41.702 --> 06:43.367
Camille,
we've talked about this.

06:43.404 --> 06:45.837
Those movies with
fast zombies aren't realistic.

06:45.873 --> 06:47.305
We got time.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.242
All I'm saying is that part
of driving is being flexible.

06:50.244 --> 06:52.444
While also being
hypervigilant and alert!

06:52.579 --> 06:54.178
The tiniest mistake and bam!

06:54.214 --> 06:57.649
You're a bad asian driver!

06:57.718 --> 06:59.150
Yeah,
because people are the worst,

06:59.153 --> 07:01.252
But it's not her
responsibility to make

07:01.288 --> 07:03.154
Racist jerks
not be racist jerks!

07:03.157 --> 07:04.990
But if you had the choice
between her dealing with that

07:04.992 --> 07:06.724
And not dealing with that,
what would you choose?

07:06.760 --> 07:08.526
That's not a choice we have!
That's the world we live in!

07:08.562 --> 07:12.130
Anyways, since when is being
a good driver ever a bad thing?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.466
Just tell me who
I should listen to, okay?

07:15.502 --> 07:16.902
Okay.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.135
- Okay.
- Um...

07:18.172 --> 07:19.337
How about this?

07:19.339 --> 07:21.806
We'll both teach you
using our own approach

07:21.809 --> 07:22.940
And see which one works.

07:22.976 --> 07:26.711
Oh! Driving teacher battle.

07:26.780 --> 07:28.480
It's on!

07:28.482 --> 07:30.348
Time for some music.

07:30.350 --> 07:32.083
(sighing)

07:32.219 --> 07:34.418
- (music playing)
- that's--

07:34.455 --> 07:36.888
No! No music!
That was a test!

07:37.023 --> 07:39.524
You need access to
all your senses at all times!

07:39.526 --> 07:41.526
I'll drive us to a lot
where you can practice!

07:41.528 --> 07:43.028
Oh, my god.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.366
Andrew:
Vehicles are weapons.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.169
The power of life and death
is in your hands.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.639
You're always one tiny mistakes
away from complete catastrophe.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.208
Seatbelt, ignition,

07:57.211 --> 07:59.110
Brake, parking brake,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.378
Shift gears,

08:00.514 --> 08:02.580
Side view mirror,
rear-view mirror,

08:02.649 --> 08:04.716
Blind spots.

08:04.851 --> 08:06.450
Um, and rear-view.

08:06.487 --> 08:08.052
(clapping)
alright.

08:08.121 --> 08:11.188
Now take your foot off the brake
and give it a little gas.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.593
Brake!

08:14.728 --> 08:15.860
(horn honking)

08:15.863 --> 08:17.929
You're learning.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.196
Next time just--

08:19.233 --> 08:20.164
(horn honking)

08:20.300 --> 08:21.165
What do I do?!

08:21.235 --> 08:22.199
Just follow the steps--

08:22.236 --> 08:23.134
Seatbelt--

08:23.270 --> 08:24.869
(horn honking)

08:24.872 --> 08:29.140
She is learning to drive,
you monster!

08:29.176 --> 08:30.742
See?
All drivers are nightmares!

08:30.744 --> 08:32.477
They're all trying to kill you!

08:32.479 --> 08:34.813
Okay, dad. I--

08:34.815 --> 08:36.881
I need a change of energy.
Mom, you're up!

08:36.884 --> 08:38.783
Just out.

08:42.455 --> 08:45.423
And they just have
the most delicious macarons.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.491
Oh, yeah. It's incredible.

08:46.626 --> 08:47.825
Some of the best
french food I've ever had.

08:47.895 --> 08:50.161
It can't be better
than that place in paris.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.429
Right, mom?

08:51.498 --> 08:54.232
Where did we have
that perfect café crème?

08:54.367 --> 08:56.033
Ooh!
You've been to France?

08:56.069 --> 08:57.135
Oui.

08:57.204 --> 09:00.505
Super!
Quel était ton café préféré?

09:00.640 --> 09:03.474
(laughing in exaggerated
french accent)

09:03.510 --> 09:06.411
I have an identical
twin brother.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.246
I'm the good looking one.

09:08.248 --> 09:09.714

09:09.716 --> 09:11.016
Luca is his name.

09:11.018 --> 09:13.184
Leo and luca,
that's us.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.753
For real twins.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.421
- Leo, what are you doing here?
- Leo: Jojo?

09:17.457 --> 09:18.723
Who's this?

09:20.227 --> 09:22.660
Um... My mother!

09:22.696 --> 09:24.129
That's not your--

09:24.131 --> 09:25.930
(whispering) blink twice if
you need me to call someone.

09:25.966 --> 09:30.535
♪

09:30.670 --> 09:33.438
Cricket? Really?

09:33.440 --> 09:35.740
Don't these games
usually last days?

09:35.776 --> 09:38.075
Yup! Five beautiful days
of yelling out our emotions.

09:38.111 --> 09:41.346
Chris hawthorne's last test
match before he retires.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.548
Announcer: This is going to
be a monumental occasion.

09:43.683 --> 09:47.152
The most beloved
cricketer in recent memory.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.153
He is beloved,
but everything's gotta come

09:48.288 --> 09:50.288
To an end sooner or later,
you know?

09:50.290 --> 09:52.289
And it's important to talk
about those things when they do.

09:52.326 --> 09:53.425
So, you do.

09:53.427 --> 09:55.627
He plays

09:55.629 --> 09:59.564
If only everyone
could say the same.

09:59.566 --> 10:01.766
Tell me about it.

No, seriously though,
like, tell me about it.

It's a spin to--

10:07.074 --> 10:08.506
Oh, he hits it!
He flicks it over midwicket!

10:08.642 --> 10:12.510
And it-- no! It's caught.
Oh no!

10:12.579 --> 10:14.245
How very disappointing.

10:14.247 --> 10:16.514
Disappointing, indeed.

10:16.516 --> 10:20.585
I mean he had all his hopes
and dreams for today.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.086
All dashed away.

10:23.790 --> 10:27.525
How does that make you feel?
'cause I feel pretty bad.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.861
It does make one think.

10:29.930 --> 10:33.531
I, too, had hoped and dreamed

10:33.533 --> 10:35.934
For a chocolate croissant.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.601
Cathy, do you have one?

10:37.638 --> 10:38.937
Coming up.

Announcer:
What a take indeed.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.076
Thought you said
this would work.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.811
- Never said that.
- Well, it didn't.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.680
Now, we just gotta
get in there and dig deep.

10:48.815 --> 10:49.747
- No. No, we don't.
- Yup.

10:49.783 --> 10:50.948
Oh, oh!

10:51.018 --> 10:52.617
We can role-play.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.719
- No.
- Yes, yes.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.020
Come on, cathy.
You gotta jump on board.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.155
You gotta do this.
It's for meshy. Meshy needs us.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.157
- Fine.
- Yes!

10:59.159 --> 11:00.658
But I'm not calling him "meshy."

11:00.694 --> 11:02.160
Okay, okay. Fine.

11:02.229 --> 11:05.162
Camille: So, my approach
is more intuitive.

11:05.198 --> 11:09.033
You have to see yourself
as an extension of the car.

11:09.036 --> 11:11.903
Person and machine,
together as one.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.304
How you feel?

11:13.306 --> 11:15.406
Like I should stick
to taking the bus.

11:15.409 --> 11:16.841
I don't want you to be afraid.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.709
I want you to be brave.

11:18.745 --> 11:21.312
Like a fearless road warrior.

11:21.314 --> 11:22.313
Andrew: Ooh!

11:22.315 --> 11:25.382
(both laughing)

11:25.419 --> 11:27.152
Oh, hell no. Okay.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.186
- No.
- I've got this.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.388
What? Dad! N-no!

11:31.425 --> 11:34.792
Hey! It's my daughter's
sixteenth birthday

11:34.828 --> 11:36.393
And she's learning how to drive.

11:36.430 --> 11:38.463
I'd like you to think
back to the first time

11:38.598 --> 11:40.198
You did something,
and how you'd feel

11:40.267 --> 11:42.266
If someone was laughing at you.

11:42.335 --> 11:46.938
I think both of y'all got
some work to do on your empathy!

11:47.073 --> 11:48.572
Stupid skater boys!

11:50.077 --> 11:53.277
Oh, my gosh. Launch me into
the core of the sun.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.280
Okay, well, now that
your dad has had his moment,

11:55.415 --> 11:57.081
- Let's get out of here.
- Andrew: Whoa!

11:57.084 --> 11:58.817
I don't know.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.851
No.
You are a road warrior!

12:02.189 --> 12:04.688
You're perpetrating
a hate crime, you dinks!

12:04.725 --> 12:07.025
Oh! I don't know!
You guys should drive!

12:07.160 --> 12:09.527
Just believe! Road warrior!

12:09.529 --> 12:13.364
(screaming)

12:13.433 --> 12:16.501
I'm doing it!
I'm dri-- I'm driving!

12:16.570 --> 12:19.170
Camille: A little tighter
on the next turn, but great!

12:19.206 --> 12:21.172
Now drive us home,
birthday girl.

12:21.307 --> 12:25.777
Yeah, so leo's biological
parents are camille and andrew,

12:25.779 --> 12:28.712
But recently we formed
a platonic throuple.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.848
Wherein I take on parenting
duties on the weekends.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.919
So, we get leo
and his twin brother luther--

12:34.988 --> 12:36.187
- Luca.
- Loofa.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.123
--To call me mom,

12:38.258 --> 12:39.457
Because it avoids confusion
and-and--

12:39.592 --> 12:42.126
And then
I get to feel involved.

12:42.129 --> 12:43.461
Right, leo?

12:43.596 --> 12:45.997
I don't think
she's buying it, sam.

12:46.066 --> 12:49.868
I mean, what even is
a mother anyway, you know?

12:50.003 --> 12:51.836
It takes a village
to raise a child,

12:51.905 --> 12:53.270
And mothers can
come in all forms.

12:53.306 --> 12:56.141
Biological and otherwise.
I mean, have you seen pose?

12:56.276 --> 12:59.477
Um, if you'll excuse me.
My actual daughter needs me.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.946
What's a throuple?

13:01.948 --> 13:07.018
♪

13:07.020 --> 13:11.356
Oh, it's okay. I'm--
I'm getting the hang of this.

13:11.358 --> 13:13.091
Honestly, I rule at this.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.626
I should open
my own driving school.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.162
Yeah, we should.

13:18.165 --> 13:19.764
Team effort.

13:19.899 --> 13:22.433
Yeah, the me in team. Eh.

13:22.502 --> 13:24.468
Andrew:
Brake! Brake! Brake!

13:29.876 --> 13:32.644
Camille! This is your fault
and yours alone!

13:32.646 --> 13:34.379
Oh, no. It's just a sign.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.846
Andrew:
Just a sign?

13:35.882 --> 13:38.449
It's shaped like a child
so you don't run over it!

13:38.485 --> 13:39.783
You told me to turn tighter!

13:39.820 --> 13:40.985
Oh she definitely did.

13:41.054 --> 13:42.920
I didn't mean that tight,
and you, cut it out.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.355
Hey, I'm just pointing out
who was in the front seat

13:44.490 --> 13:45.389
When this happened.

13:47.561 --> 13:48.660
- It's just--
- oh-- oh, my god.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.461
Oh, my gosh!

13:50.597 --> 13:53.531
Worst birthday ever!

13:53.533 --> 13:56.333
Khia! You can't flee
the scene of an accident!

13:56.369 --> 13:58.736
- It's so sad.
- He broke his foot.

13:58.738 --> 14:00.871
- I'm writing a note.
- It's not even a useful sign

14:00.907 --> 14:02.873
And I'll fix it.
And I have. New sign.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.879
(clearing throat)

14:08.915 --> 14:11.148
(banging)

14:11.218 --> 14:14.018
(groaning)
you're so stubborn!

14:14.020 --> 14:16.220
It's like it's
your way or no way.

14:16.223 --> 14:17.889
Do you even believe in me?

14:18.024 --> 14:19.023
Cathy?

14:19.025 --> 14:20.424
What?!

14:20.426 --> 14:23.828
It seems like there's
been some misdirected anger.

14:23.830 --> 14:26.030
When I'm in emotionally
stressful scenarios,

14:26.099 --> 14:28.099
I find that role playing helps.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.535
Well, I don't need help!
I'm an island!

14:30.537 --> 14:31.835
She said she's an island.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.305
No, no, no! Hey!
Let's just try it!

14:34.341 --> 14:35.906
Let's just try it.

14:35.942 --> 14:39.043
If you must know,

14:39.079 --> 14:42.113
That was really about...

14:42.182 --> 14:44.248
My mom.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.050
Great, that is great.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.853
Ramesh,
you mind playing her mom?

14:48.988 --> 14:50.021
Oh, I really--

14:50.090 --> 14:51.089
Mom!

14:51.224 --> 14:52.657
All my life I feel
like I haven't

14:52.726 --> 14:55.192
Lived up to your expectations.

14:57.197 --> 14:59.430
Like when I dropped out
of college and moved away.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.767
Mom?

15:03.803 --> 15:06.137
Ah, yes. Um...

15:06.206 --> 15:10.007
Well, I suppose that's simply
because I wanted the best

15:10.143 --> 15:11.208
For your future.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.943
Is that all you have
to say for yourself?

15:12.979 --> 15:14.779
Um, and...

15:16.549 --> 15:20.418
I suppose I can
be overbearing, but...

15:22.822 --> 15:25.022
I have a gentle heart,

15:25.158 --> 15:29.093
And you leaving smashed
that into a million pieces.

15:29.162 --> 15:32.897
I poured so much into this
relationship and you just left!

15:32.899 --> 15:34.631
Well, I had to do
what was good for me,

15:34.668 --> 15:36.100
Even if it was hard for you.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.236
You didn't even give me
a chance to win you back!

15:38.238 --> 15:39.470
You want me to be happy, right?

15:39.605 --> 15:43.107
I-- yeah, of course.

15:43.109 --> 15:47.044
(music playing over speakers)

15:47.080 --> 15:49.113
I'm still sad about barb.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.548
I'm mad at my mom.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.651
You see? Do you see?!

15:53.653 --> 15:57.588
Doesn't it feel good for your
hearts to just talk about it?

15:57.624 --> 16:00.124
You mad genius.
You manipulated me.

16:00.160 --> 16:02.927
For your own good, I'm sorry.

16:02.996 --> 16:05.062
Okay, ramesh,

16:05.098 --> 16:07.598
Do you wanna talk about barb?

16:07.600 --> 16:10.934
And cathy, do you want to

16:10.971 --> 16:14.805
Talk about your mom?
Let's have a chat. Okay.

Happy birthday,

16:32.392 --> 16:33.291
Thanks.

16:35.228 --> 16:37.695
Remember when we use to
fantasize about being 16?

16:37.830 --> 16:39.764
Driving cars, being free?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.165
The fantasy was wrong.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.233
I'm sorry.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.102
My parents had
my anxiety on 1000

16:45.171 --> 16:47.171
And I can't close
my eyes without seeing

16:47.173 --> 16:50.174
That gingerbread massacre.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.642
They really
freaked you out, huh?

16:51.711 --> 16:53.845
No, I wasn't at first.

16:53.847 --> 16:57.448
Then dad said that
the car was a murder weapon

16:57.583 --> 17:01.318
And mom was like,
"you're a warrior!"

17:01.320 --> 17:03.654
It was just intense!

17:03.656 --> 17:06.390
Andrew and camille
intense?

17:06.393 --> 17:07.592
(laughing)

17:07.727 --> 17:08.993
I'm glad you're laughing,

17:09.062 --> 17:11.795
But I'm not the one you
should be telling all this to.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.464
And, you know,
if you change your mind,

17:13.500 --> 17:17.201
I'm at a school.
It's so much better.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.236
My dad tried teaching me

17:18.238 --> 17:21.338

all of three minutes.

last time we went bowling.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.960
She's a lawyer
I really want to network with,

17:43.029 --> 17:45.129
And so when she
assumed you were my kid

17:45.264 --> 17:47.365
I just kind of went with it.

17:47.367 --> 17:50.168
Hm. The road to hell,

I couldn't let

Asking you to lie for me.

I love lying.

18:04.717 --> 18:07.284
Cool.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.797
Text me next time
you're near the office

18:19.932 --> 18:21.465
And we'll grab a coffee.

18:21.468 --> 18:25.803
Wh-- oh. Yeah.
Okay. Great. Um...

18:25.938 --> 18:27.538
I was pretty sure you'd never
want to speak to me again.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.207
You know,
when I was starting out,

18:29.342 --> 18:32.743
I used to try to schmooze
with lawyers at the health club.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.412
Tore my achilles pretending
I knew how to play squash.

18:35.482 --> 18:37.147
- (chuckling)
- I get your hustle.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.916
It's hard out here.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.418
Thank you.

18:41.488 --> 18:42.886
Yeah. I'm always looking
for people who are willing

18:42.922 --> 18:45.356
To go the extra mile.

18:45.425 --> 18:46.990
Maybe you'll be
a lawyer someday.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.630
How much money did you make when
you were a full time lawyer?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.098
Oh, that's a rude question.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.435
I know, but how much?

18:59.505 --> 19:00.437
A lot, leo.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.608
Camille: Do you think
the stars should be bigger?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.709
Much bigger.

19:04.844 --> 19:06.110
Okay, yeah. We're going
to have to start again.

19:06.112 --> 19:08.312
Add more exclamation marks.
Okay, grab me the--

19:08.381 --> 19:10.047
- You're home!
- Be chill.

19:12.952 --> 19:14.418
You're home.

19:15.788 --> 19:18.122
Khia, I'm sorry.

19:18.124 --> 19:19.123
I pushed too hard.

19:19.258 --> 19:20.958
We pushed too hard.

19:21.027 --> 19:23.995
I know that you didn't mean to,
but you two made everything

19:23.997 --> 19:26.464
A million times worse,

19:26.466 --> 19:28.265
And because of that,

19:28.401 --> 19:30.868
I'm-- I've decided
I'm never driving again.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.135
What?! No.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.139
I scratched van diesel!

19:35.274 --> 19:36.173
What?!

19:36.308 --> 19:37.875
You said it was
a mystery accident!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.876
Yeah, why would you
lie about that?

19:39.913 --> 19:41.612
Because I didn't want to
play into the stereotype!

19:41.681 --> 19:43.180
It was my first accident ever!

19:43.182 --> 19:45.316
You ripped a side mirror off
going through a drive thru.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.484
Didn't count.
Those angles are busted.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.585
And the bumper in the snow bank?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.954
But everyone makes mistakes.

19:50.990 --> 19:54.025
The important thing is
that you get back in the car

19:54.027 --> 19:56.561
And you try again.
Giving up is never the answer.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.763
Your dad is right,
but there's no rush either.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.699
We'll be ready
when you're ready.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.835
Okay, well, when I am ready,
could you guys pitch in

20:04.837 --> 20:06.670
To get me professional
driving lessons?

20:08.107 --> 20:10.173
Yeah, of course,
we can swing that.

20:10.210 --> 20:14.378
And because you totally
ruined my birthday,

20:14.380 --> 20:17.047
Can I open presents early?

20:17.083 --> 20:18.015
(chuckling)

20:19.953 --> 20:21.885
Ooh, from sam.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.390

a tiny glass.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.492
Oh, khia, this is awkward,

20:28.494 --> 20:30.127
But that's
actually a shot glass.

20:30.263 --> 20:31.462
Oh, she's messing with us.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.831
Yeah. Dad, it says
"day drunk" on it.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.333
Thank you, auntie sam.

20:36.402 --> 20:39.470
This is going away
for another three years.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.212

Mannix said that this was
the best driving school.

20:50.349 --> 20:51.482
- Oh!
- Mannix?

20:51.484 --> 20:52.950
Y'all are talking again?

20:53.085 --> 20:55.019
I think so? Maybe?

20:55.088 --> 20:56.420
I don't know.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.522
Baby steps.
Have fun, khia.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.690
Okay.
Oh, don't wait up!

Oh, man, he's asian?!

Andrew!

21:04.731 --> 21:05.630
My bad.

21:05.765 --> 21:06.897
I gotta unpack that later.

Hm.

(knocking)

21:09.602 --> 21:10.567
Good!

21:11.971 --> 21:15.706
Aw, we really traumatized her.

21:15.841 --> 21:16.707
Yeah.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.710
Andrew:
I blame my parents.

Oh, I blame you.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.113
Yeah, that makes sense.
