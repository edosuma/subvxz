"But not all of you have
to die," said he.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.419

Who will be the lamb
for my slaughter?

or fail, and all your lives
you'll give.

What should we do
about that crazy voice?

17:45.765 --> 17:47.467
We should probably come up
with a plan.

17:47.500 --> 17:48.868
Maybe later.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.137
Maybe you should just think

about some of your favorite
memories, fairbell.

Remember that time we were stuck
in the school, and...

and had to wear badonks?

of a plan, i will.
