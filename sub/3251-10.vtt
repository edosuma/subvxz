How are we
looking?

00:13.592 --> 00:15.892
Oh, about ready,
I think.

00:17.929 --> 00:20.130
Any thoughts

00:20.132 --> 00:22.365
on the
interference?

00:22.367 --> 00:24.934
A stray FM broadcast,
possibly.

00:24.936 --> 00:27.303
But I've -- some
ferrite suppressors

00:27.305 --> 00:29.906
and some RF chokes,
just in case.

00:35.646 --> 00:37.313
Are you sure you want
to go through with this?

00:37.315 --> 00:38.682
I mean, the last time,
it was very --

00:38.684 --> 00:40.083
But she's
so lonely.

00:40.085 --> 00:43.319
Excellent,

00:43.321 --> 00:44.888
then,

00:44.890 --> 00:46.056
excellent.

00:54.800 --> 00:57.467
Caliburn House,
night 4,

00:57.469 --> 01:00.370
November 25, 1974,

01:00.372 --> 01:02.505
11:04 pm.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.315
I'm talking
to the spirit

01:12.317 --> 01:13.817
that inhabits
this house.

01:13.819 --> 01:15.685
Are you there?

01:15.687 --> 01:17.487
Can you hear me?

01:22.960 --> 01:24.928
I'm speaking
to the lost soul

01:24.930 --> 01:26.796
that abides
in this place.

01:30.168 --> 01:32.836
Come to me.

01:32.838 --> 01:35.205
Speak to me.

01:35.207 --> 01:36.706
Let me show you
the way home.

01:36.708 --> 01:38.341
Ooh!

01:42.113 --> 01:43.947
Let me show you
the way home!

<i>Aaaah!</i>

She's so...

02:00.665 --> 02:02.298
So what?

02:02.300 --> 02:05.068
Dead.

02:20.851 --> 02:22.285
Boo!

02:22.287 --> 02:24.154
Ha ha! Hello. I'm

And this is Clara.

03:08.300 --> 03:12.435
Oh, you are very
decadent! Ha.

03:12.437 --> 03:14.904
You are Major Alec Palmer,
member of

03:14.906 --> 03:16.272
the Baker Street
Irregulars,

03:16.274 --> 03:18.274
the Ministry of
Ungentlemanly warfare,

03:18.276 --> 03:20.810
specialized in
espionage, sabotage,

03:20.812 --> 03:23.112
and reconnaissance
behind enemy lines.

03:23.114 --> 03:25.315
You're a talented
watercolorist,

03:25.317 --> 03:28.151
professor of psychology,
<i>and...</i>

03:28.153 --> 03:29.452
ghost hunter.

03:29.454 --> 03:31.354
Total pleasure.

03:31.356 --> 03:33.056
Massive.

03:33.058 --> 03:35.058
Actually,
you're wrong.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.793
Prof Palmer spent most
of the war as a P.O.W.

03:36.795 --> 03:38.962
Actually, that's a lie
told by a very brave man

03:38.964 --> 03:40.763
involved in very
secret operations.

03:40.765 --> 03:42.265
The type of man who
keeps a Victoria Cross

03:42.267 --> 03:43.900
in a box
in the attic, eh?

03:43.902 --> 03:46.069
But you know that, because
you're Emma Grayling.

03:47.671 --> 03:49.372
The Professor's
companion.

03:49.374 --> 03:50.506
Assistant.

03:50.508 --> 03:52.542
It's 1974. You're
the <i>assistant</i>

03:52.544 --> 03:54.510
and "nonobjective
equipment",

03:54.512 --> 03:55.612
meaning "psychic."

03:55.614 --> 03:57.046
Getting that.
Bless you, though.

03:57.048 --> 03:59.949
Relax, Emma. He's
Military Intelligence.

03:59.951 --> 04:01.484
So, what is all this
in aid of?

04:01.486 --> 04:03.987
Health and safety.
Yeah.

04:03.989 --> 04:06.256
The Ministry got wind
of what's going on

04:06.258 --> 04:07.924
down here,
sent me to check

04:07.926 --> 04:09.592
that everything's
in order.

04:09.594 --> 04:11.027
They don't have
the right.

04:11.029 --> 04:12.528
Don't worry, Governor,
I'll be out of here

04:12.530 --> 04:15.598
in five minutes.
Oh! Oh, look!

04:15.600 --> 04:18.067
Oh, lovely.
The ACR99821.

04:18.069 --> 04:20.435
Oh, bliss. Nice action
on the toggle switches.

04:20.438 --> 04:21.938
You know, I do love

04:21.940 --> 04:23.606
a toggle switch!

04:23.608 --> 04:26.142
Actually, I like
the word "toggle".

04:26.144 --> 04:27.577
Nice noun.

04:27.579 --> 04:28.811
Excellent verb.

04:28.813 --> 04:32.215
Oi! Don't mess
with the settings.

04:32.217 --> 04:34.150
What's that?

04:34.152 --> 04:36.552
Gadget. Health and Safety.
Classified, I'm afraid.

04:36.554 --> 04:37.921
You know, while
the backroom boffins

04:37.923 --> 04:39.589
work out a few kinks.

04:39.591 --> 04:42.191
What's it
telling you?

04:42.193 --> 04:44.227
It's telling me that you
haven't been exposed

04:44.229 --> 04:46.329
to any life threatening
transmundane eminations.

04:46.331 --> 04:49.799
So,

04:49.801 --> 04:51.467
where's
the ghost, huh?

04:54.272 --> 04:57.507
Show me the ghost.

05:00.478 --> 05:01.978
It's ghost time.

05:04.949 --> 05:06.416
I will not
have this

05:06.418 --> 05:07.917
stolen out from under me.
Do you understand?

05:07.919 --> 05:09.719
No, not really.
Sorry.

05:09.721 --> 05:11.087
I will not have
my work stolen

05:11.089 --> 05:12.755
and be fobbed off
with a pat on the back

05:12.757 --> 05:14.490
and a letter from the
Queen, never again.

05:14.492 --> 05:17.794
This is my house, Doctor,
and it belongs to me.

05:17.796 --> 05:19.295
This is actually
your house?

05:19.297 --> 05:21.331
It is.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.966
Sorry, you went
to the bank

05:22.968 --> 05:24.400
and said, "you know
that gigantic,

05:24.402 --> 05:26.336
old, haunted house
on the moors?

05:26.338 --> 05:27.837
The one the dossers
are too scared to doss in,

05:27.839 --> 05:29.772
the one the birds are
too scared to fly over"

05:29.774 --> 05:31.674
and then you said,
"I'd like to buy it,

05:31.676 --> 05:33.109
please,
with my money"?

05:33.111 --> 05:34.877
Yes, I did,
actually.

05:34.879 --> 05:37.046
That's incredibly
brave.

05:38.950 --> 05:40.817
Listen, Major,

05:40.819 --> 05:43.553
we just need to know
what's going on here.

05:43.555 --> 05:44.787
For the Ministry?

05:44.789 --> 05:47.123
You know I can't
answer that.

05:48.393 --> 05:51.361
Very well.

05:51.363 --> 05:52.528
Follow me.

06:01.538 --> 06:03.873
So what's
an "empathic psychic"?

06:03.875 --> 06:07.510
Sometimes
I sense feelings,

06:07.512 --> 06:09.045
the way a telepath
can sense thoughts.

06:09.047 --> 06:11.447
Sometimes, though,
not always.

06:11.449 --> 06:13.116
<i>The</i> most
compassionate people

06:13.118 --> 06:15.084
you will ever meet,
empathics.

06:15.086 --> 06:17.253
And the loneliest.

06:17.255 --> 06:18.554
I mean, exposing
themselves

06:18.556 --> 06:20.556
to all those
hidden feelings,

06:20.558 --> 06:22.058
all that guilt,

06:22.060 --> 06:23.526
pain, and sorrow
and --

06:23.528 --> 06:24.594
Doctor.
Yes?

06:24.596 --> 06:26.763
Shh.

06:26.765 --> 06:28.998
Would you care
to have a look?

06:30.769 --> 06:33.669
Caliburn House

06:33.671 --> 06:35.671
is over
400 years old,

06:35.673 --> 06:39.409
but she has been
around much longer --

06:39.411 --> 06:41.210
the Caliburn Ghast.

06:43.747 --> 06:45.148
She's mentioned

06:45.150 --> 06:48.451
in local Saxon poetry
and Parish folktales --

06:48.453 --> 06:50.520
the wraith
of the lady,

06:50.522 --> 06:53.056
the Maiden
in the Dark,

06:53.058 --> 06:55.491
the Witch
of the Well.

06:55.493 --> 06:57.927
Is she real?

06:57.929 --> 07:00.430
As in
actually real.

07:00.432 --> 07:01.998
Oh,
she's real.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.734
In the 17th century,
a local clergyman saw her.

07:04.736 --> 07:06.202
He wrote
that her presence

07:06.204 --> 07:09.138
was accompanied by
a dreadful knocking,

07:09.140 --> 07:11.841
as if the Devil himself
demanded entry.

07:13.244 --> 07:14.644
During the war,

07:14.646 --> 07:16.379
American airmen
stationed here

07:16.381 --> 07:18.948
left offerings
of tinned Spam.

07:18.950 --> 07:19.949
The tins were found
in 1965,

07:19.951 --> 07:22.218
bricked up in the
servants' pantry,

07:22.220 --> 07:24.020
along with a number
of handwritten notes,

07:24.022 --> 07:25.455
appeals
to the Ghast --

07:25.457 --> 07:27.657
"for the love
of God,

07:27.659 --> 07:29.559
stop screaming."

07:29.561 --> 07:31.594
<i>Aaaaah!</i>

07:31.596 --> 07:34.497
She never changes.

07:37.067 --> 07:38.734
The angle's different,
the framing, but she's

07:38.736 --> 07:40.870
always in exactly
the same position.

07:40.872 --> 07:42.839
Why is that?
We don't know.

07:42.841 --> 07:44.874
She's an objective
phenomenon,

07:44.876 --> 07:46.242
but objective

07:46.244 --> 07:48.377
recording equipment
can't detect her.

07:48.379 --> 07:50.446
Without the presence
of a powerful psychic.

07:50.448 --> 07:52.014
Absolutely.

07:52.016 --> 07:53.649
Very well done.

07:53.651 --> 07:55.952
<i>Hel-l-l-p!</i>

07:55.954 --> 07:58.654
She knows I'm here.

07:59.790 --> 08:02.391
I can feel her,

08:02.393 --> 08:05.128
calling out to me.

08:05.130 --> 08:07.430
What's she saying?

08:09.933 --> 08:11.667
<i>Help me.</i>
"Help me."

08:11.669 --> 08:13.536
<i>Help me-e-e!</i>

08:22.079 --> 08:24.147
The Witch
of the Well.

08:25.816 --> 08:28.885
So where's the well?

08:28.887 --> 08:30.887
A copy of the oldest plan
that we could find.

08:30.889 --> 08:34.289
There is no well
on the property.

08:34.292 --> 08:36.424
I mean, none that
we could find, anyway.

08:41.332 --> 08:42.899
Are you coming?

08:42.900 --> 08:44.232
Where?
To find the ghost.

08:44.235 --> 08:45.601
Why would I want
to do that?

08:45.603 --> 08:46.969
Because you want to.
Come on.

08:46.971 --> 08:48.571
Well, I dispute
that assertion!

08:48.573 --> 08:50.473
Eh?

08:50.475 --> 08:51.807
Jumping at shadows.

08:51.809 --> 08:54.443
I'm giving you
a face.

08:54.445 --> 08:55.444
Yeah?

08:55.446 --> 08:57.013
Can you see me?
Look at my face.

08:58.248 --> 09:00.650
Fine!

09:03.520 --> 09:05.454
Dare me.

09:05.456 --> 09:07.657
I dare you.

09:07.659 --> 09:11.160
No takesy-
backsies?

09:11.162 --> 09:12.962
Hmm.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.700
The Music Room is
the heart of the house.

09:30.127 --> 09:31.995
Say we actually
find her.

09:31.997 --> 09:33.163
What do we say?

09:33.165 --> 09:35.165
We ask her
how she came to be

09:35.167 --> 09:36.600
whatever she is.

09:36.602 --> 09:39.202
Why?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.071
Because I don't know
and ignorance is...

09:41.073 --> 09:43.206
What's the opposite
of bliss?

09:43.208 --> 09:44.207
Carlisle.

09:44.209 --> 09:46.743
Yes!
Yes, Carlisle.

09:46.745 --> 09:50.680
Ignorance is
Carlisle.

10:24.615 --> 10:26.282
Is he really
from the Ministry?

10:26.284 --> 10:29.619
Uh, I don't know.

10:29.621 --> 10:31.621
He's certainly got
the right demeanor --

10:31.623 --> 10:36.092
capricious,
brilliant, heh.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.293
Deceitful.

10:37.295 --> 10:39.529
Yes.

10:39.531 --> 10:42.499
He's a liar.

10:42.501 --> 10:44.000
But, you know,

10:44.002 --> 10:47.237
that's often the way
that it is

10:47.239 --> 10:50.540
when someone's
seen a thing or two.

10:50.542 --> 10:54.310
Experience makes
liars of us all.

10:54.312 --> 10:57.380
We lie
about who we are,

10:57.382 --> 10:59.482
about what
we've done...

10:59.484 --> 11:01.818
And how we feel.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.621
Yes.

11:04.623 --> 11:07.757
Always.

11:07.759 --> 11:10.427
Always that.

11:13.631 --> 11:15.765
You know, I have to,
um, I have to be

11:15.767 --> 11:18.468
getting on with things,
the, um,

11:18.470 --> 11:20.170
the equipment,
and so forth.

11:20.172 --> 11:21.271
Of course.

11:28.145 --> 11:29.913
Ah, the Music Room,

11:29.915 --> 11:32.382
the heart
of the house.

11:32.384 --> 11:35.218
Do you feel
anything?

11:35.220 --> 11:37.387
No.

11:37.389 --> 11:38.755
Your pants
are so on fire.

11:48.165 --> 11:51.000
Do you feel like
you're being watched?

11:51.002 --> 11:52.802
What does being
watched feel like?

11:52.804 --> 11:54.170
Is it that funny,
tickly feeling

11:54.172 --> 11:55.538
on the back
of your neck?

11:55.540 --> 11:56.906
That's the chap.

11:56.908 --> 11:58.708
Then, yes, a bit.
Well,

11:58.710 --> 12:00.276
quite a big bit.

12:17.362 --> 12:18.862
I think she's here.

12:23.134 --> 12:24.634
Cold spot.

12:24.636 --> 12:26.569
Spooky.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.171
Cold.

12:28.173 --> 12:29.606
Warm.

12:29.608 --> 12:31.641
Cold.
Warm. Cold.

12:33.845 --> 12:35.745
Cold. Warm.

12:35.747 --> 12:36.846
Cold.

12:40.084 --> 12:41.885
Doctor.

12:44.622 --> 12:46.222
Doctor!
What?

12:46.224 --> 12:47.991
I'm not happy.

12:47.993 --> 12:51.761
No.

12:57.102 --> 12:58.401
Eh!

13:18.056 --> 13:20.190
Ohh.

13:20.192 --> 13:21.724
What was that?

13:31.735 --> 13:33.570
Does it seem
colder?

13:46.885 --> 13:48.351
She's coming.

13:52.791 --> 13:55.124
Okay,
what is that?

13:55.126 --> 13:57.393
It's, uh -- it --
it's a very loud noise.

13:57.395 --> 13:59.028
It's a very loud,

13:59.030 --> 14:01.130
very angry noise.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.399
Who's making it?
I don't know. Are <i>you</i> making it?

14:06.638 --> 14:07.637
Doctor.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.705
Yes?

14:08.707 --> 14:10.206
I may be a teeny,
tiny bit terrified --

14:10.208 --> 14:11.207
Yes?

14:11.209 --> 14:12.675
But I'm still
a grownup.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.010
Ha, mainly,
yes, and?

14:14.012 --> 14:15.778
There's no need to
actually hold my hand.

14:15.780 --> 14:18.047
Clara.

14:18.049 --> 14:19.048
Yeah?

14:19.050 --> 14:21.951
I'm not holding
your hand.

14:21.953 --> 14:22.952
Aah!

14:22.954 --> 14:24.354
Aaaaaaah!
Aah!

14:24.356 --> 14:26.089
Aaah!

14:27.625 --> 14:28.625
Whoa!

14:31.262 --> 14:33.263
Has this
happened before?

14:33.265 --> 14:35.131
Never.

14:35.133 --> 14:37.166
Camera. Camera!

14:47.779 --> 14:49.445
<i>Help me-e-e!</i>

14:49.447 --> 14:50.647
<i>Help!</i>

14:50.649 --> 14:52.315
<i>Me-e-e!</i>

14:52.317 --> 14:54.450
<i>Help! Me-e-e!</i>

14:54.452 --> 14:55.852
Doctor!

14:57.822 --> 15:01.157
<i>Aaaaaaaaaah!</i>

15:01.159 --> 15:03.026
<i>Help me-e-e!</i>

15:06.197 --> 15:07.196
Doctor.

15:35.450 --> 15:37.819
Oh!

15:37.821 --> 15:39.921
I'd rather have
a nice cup of tea.

15:39.923 --> 15:41.689
Me too.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.524
Whiskey is

15:43.526 --> 15:45.560
the 11th-most disgusting
drink ever invented.

15:49.631 --> 15:51.599
I had a little peek
at your records,

15:51.601 --> 15:54.001
back at the Ministry.

15:54.003 --> 15:55.503
Well, you've certainly
seen a thing or two,

15:55.505 --> 15:57.305
in your time --
disrupting

15:57.307 --> 15:59.106
U-Boat operations
across the North Sea,

15:59.108 --> 16:02.243
sabotaging railway lines
across Europe,

16:02.245 --> 16:04.312
Operation Gibbon,
the one with

16:04.314 --> 16:06.547
the carrier pigeons --
brilliant.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.449
I do love
a carrier pigeon.

16:08.451 --> 16:10.251
I did my duty,

16:10.253 --> 16:12.386
but, then, so did
thousands of others.

16:12.388 --> 16:13.888
Millions

16:13.890 --> 16:15.690
of others.

16:15.692 --> 16:18.092
I was just lucky
enough to come back.

16:18.094 --> 16:20.461
Yes, but, how does that
man, that war hero,

16:20.463 --> 16:22.563
end up here,
in a lonely old house,

16:22.565 --> 16:23.965
looking for ghosts?

16:28.036 --> 16:29.737
Because I killed.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.606
And I caused
to have killed.

16:31.608 --> 16:34.442
I sent

16:34.444 --> 16:37.345
young men and women
to their deaths,

16:37.347 --> 16:41.015
but here I am,
still alive,

16:41.017 --> 16:44.552
and, well, it does
tend to haunt you,

16:44.554 --> 16:46.654
living,
after so much

16:46.656 --> 16:49.323
of the other thing.

16:51.727 --> 16:52.927
So, you and
Professor Palmer,

16:52.929 --> 16:54.428
you ever...

16:54.430 --> 16:56.397
You know?

16:56.399 --> 16:57.798
No.

16:57.800 --> 16:59.000
Why not?

16:59.002 --> 17:00.334
You do know
how he feels

17:00.336 --> 17:02.770
about you, don't you?
You, of all people.

17:02.772 --> 17:04.906
I don't know.

17:06.308 --> 17:09.076
People like me,

17:09.078 --> 17:10.944
sometimes we get
our signals mixed up.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.613
We think people
are feeling

17:12.615 --> 17:16.349
the way we want
them to feel,

17:16.352 --> 17:18.886
you know, when they're
special to us,

17:18.887 --> 17:20.655
when, really,

17:20.656 --> 17:22.556
there's
nothing there.

17:22.558 --> 17:24.291
Oh, this is there.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.527
How do you know?

17:26.529 --> 17:27.694
Because it's obvious.

17:27.696 --> 17:29.297
It sticks out

17:29.299 --> 17:31.065
like a big chin.

17:33.735 --> 17:36.037
You see, I was
alone and unmarried

17:36.039 --> 17:38.205
and, you know,
I didn't mind dying.

17:38.207 --> 17:39.707
I mean, not
for that cause.

17:39.709 --> 17:42.343
It was a very,
very fine cause,

17:42.345 --> 17:44.445
defeating the enemy.

17:44.447 --> 17:46.747
And if you could
contact them,

17:46.749 --> 17:48.282
what would you say?

17:48.284 --> 17:52.053
Well, I'd very much
like to thank them.

17:52.055 --> 17:53.521
Ah.

17:55.418 --> 17:56.091
Ping.

17:58.728 --> 18:00.328
What do you think
she is?

18:03.199 --> 18:04.632
Not what
I thought she'd be.

18:04.634 --> 18:06.067
What did you think
she'd be?

18:06.069 --> 18:08.269
Fun.

18:08.271 --> 18:09.937
Can I borrow
your camera?

18:09.939 --> 18:11.973
Ta.

18:13.809 --> 18:16.177
What about you
and the Doctor?

18:16.179 --> 18:17.678
Oh, I don't think so.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.647
Good.

18:19.649 --> 18:20.915
Sorry?

18:20.917 --> 18:23.250
Don't trust him.

18:24.720 --> 18:27.488
There's a sliver
of ice in his heart.

18:27.490 --> 18:30.257
Clara!

18:40.469 --> 18:42.036
I've got
this weird feeling

18:42.038 --> 18:43.537
it's looking
at me.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.973
It doesn't like me.

18:45.975 --> 18:48.075
The TARDIS
is like a cat --

18:48.077 --> 18:49.610
a bit slow to trust,

18:49.612 --> 18:52.546
but you'll get there
in the end.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.593
Hey.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.399
You need a place
to keep this.

19:11.401 --> 19:13.067
I've got one.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.636
Or I had one.

19:15.638 --> 19:17.605
I think I had one.

19:17.607 --> 19:19.106
Look around.
See if you find it.

19:19.108 --> 19:21.909
Did I have one?

19:21.911 --> 19:24.211
Am I going mad?

19:24.213 --> 19:25.513
No!
Not in here!

19:25.515 --> 19:28.149
How do you expect her
to like you

19:28.151 --> 19:29.450
if she's soaking wet?!

19:29.452 --> 19:31.385
It's a health and
safety nightmare.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.954
Sorry.

19:36.159 --> 19:37.725
So,

19:37.727 --> 19:38.926
where are we going?

19:38.928 --> 19:41.028
Nowhere. We're
staying right here.

19:41.030 --> 19:42.830
Right here, on this
exact spot,

19:42.832 --> 19:44.331
if I can work out
how to do it.

19:44.333 --> 19:45.800
So, <i>when</i>
<i>are we going?</i>

19:45.802 --> 19:48.402
That is good.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.271
That is top-notch.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.972
And the answer is?
We're going always.

19:51.974 --> 19:53.707
"We're going always."

19:53.709 --> 19:55.209
Totally!

19:55.211 --> 19:56.577
That's not actually
a sentence.

19:56.579 --> 19:58.012
Well, it's got
a verb in it.

19:58.014 --> 20:00.014
What do you think?

20:00.016 --> 20:01.449
Uh, color's a bit
boisterous.

20:01.451 --> 20:02.883
I think it
brings out my eyes.

20:02.885 --> 20:06.687
Makes my eyes hurt.

20:11.027 --> 20:13.294
Do you -- did you see
where he went?

20:13.296 --> 20:14.795
I could hear
an engine,

20:14.797 --> 20:16.664
but I can't see
any lights.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.616
Back off! Hot suit!
Hot hot hot!

20:35.618 --> 20:37.284
When are we?

20:37.286 --> 20:38.786
About 6 billion
years ago.

20:38.788 --> 20:41.856
It's a Tuesday.
I think.

20:51.399 --> 20:53.267
Hmm?

20:55.671 --> 20:59.006
Back in a mo'.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.674
Are you
all right?

21:00.676 --> 21:03.010
Totally.
Peachy keen.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.645
Okay, then. Well,
don't press any buttons

21:04.647 --> 21:06.113
or pull any levers
or make any funny faces.

21:06.115 --> 21:08.883
Actually, don't move.
Stand completely still.

21:08.885 --> 21:10.151
Don't breathe.

21:10.153 --> 21:12.153
Well,
you can breathe.

21:12.155 --> 21:14.455
But shallow
breaths.

21:35.411 --> 21:36.977
Ah. Ah.

21:36.979 --> 21:39.213
What's wrong?

21:41.416 --> 21:42.983
Did the TARDIS
say something to you?

21:42.985 --> 21:44.852
Are you being mean?!

21:44.854 --> 21:46.520
No, it's not that.
Have we just watched

21:46.522 --> 21:48.556
the entire life cycle
of Earth, birth to death?

21:48.558 --> 21:50.291
Yes.

21:50.293 --> 21:52.293
And you're okay
with that?

21:52.295 --> 21:55.863
Yes.

21:55.865 --> 21:58.332
How can you be?

21:58.334 --> 22:00.401
The TARDIS.

22:00.403 --> 22:03.237
She's time.

22:03.239 --> 22:05.272
We...
Wibbly vortex.

22:05.274 --> 22:06.774
And so on.

22:06.776 --> 22:08.576
That's not
what I mean.

22:08.578 --> 22:12.279
Okay. Some help.
Context.

22:12.281 --> 22:13.948
Cheat sheet.

22:13.950 --> 22:15.783
Something?

22:15.785 --> 22:17.985
I mean, one minute,
you're in 1974,

22:17.987 --> 22:19.653
looking for ghosts, but
all you have to do is

22:19.655 --> 22:21.021
open your eyes
and talk

22:21.023 --> 22:22.389
to whoever's
standing there.

22:22.391 --> 22:25.659
To you, I haven't
been born yet

22:25.661 --> 22:27.027
and to you,
I've been dead

22:27.029 --> 22:29.830
a hundred
billion years.

22:29.832 --> 22:31.999
Is my body out there,
somewhere,

22:32.001 --> 22:33.601
in the ground?

22:33.603 --> 22:36.670
Yes,

22:36.672 --> 22:38.205
I suppose it is.

22:38.207 --> 22:40.241
But here we are,
talking,

22:40.243 --> 22:42.409
so I am a ghost.

22:42.411 --> 22:45.613
To you,
I'm a ghost.

22:45.615 --> 22:48.148
We're all ghosts
to you.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.617
We must be nothing.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.721
No. No.

22:53.723 --> 22:55.222
You're not that.

22:55.224 --> 22:56.657
Then what are we?

22:56.659 --> 22:59.093
What can we
possibly be?

23:04.466 --> 23:07.901
You are the only
mystery

23:07.903 --> 23:10.404
worth solving.

23:35.885 --> 23:37.519
What's wrong?

23:37.521 --> 23:40.422
I just saw something
I wish I hadn't.

23:41.791 --> 23:43.292
What did you see?

23:43.294 --> 23:47.095
That everything ends.

23:47.097 --> 23:49.164
No, not everything.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.632
Not love.

23:50.634 --> 23:53.425
Not always.

23:53.426 --> 23:54.825
Right, done!

23:54.827 --> 23:56.960
That's it. Gather
round, gather round,

23:56.962 --> 23:59.163
roll up, roll up.

24:01.581 --> 24:03.715
The Ghast of
Caliburn House,

24:03.717 --> 24:05.450
never changing,
trapped in a moment

24:05.452 --> 24:07.152
of fear and torment.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.920
But what if
she's no

24:08.922 --> 24:10.589
what if she's

24:10.591 --> 24:12.791
just trapped somewhere
time runs more slowly

24:12.793 --> 24:14.593
than it does here?

24:14.595 --> 24:18.163
What if a second to her
was 100,000 years to us

24:18.165 --> 24:20.832
and what if somebody
has a magic box?

24:20.834 --> 24:22.467
A blue box,
probably.

24:22.469 --> 24:24.536
What if said somebody
could take a snapshot

24:24.538 --> 24:27.105
of her, say, every
few million years?

24:31.644 --> 24:34.913
She's not a ghost.

24:34.915 --> 24:36.982
But she's definitely
a lost soul.

24:36.984 --> 24:39.985
Her name is
Hila Tacorian.

24:39.987 --> 24:42.254
She's a pioneer,
a time traveler --

24:42.256 --> 24:44.055
or, at least, she will be,
in a few hundred years.

24:44.057 --> 24:46.057
Time travel's not possible.
The paradoxes...

24:46.059 --> 24:47.926
Resolve themselves,
by and large.

24:47.928 --> 24:49.261
How long has she
been alone?

24:49.263 --> 24:51.129
Well, time travel's
a funny old thing.

24:51.131 --> 24:52.764
I mean, from her
perspective,

24:52.766 --> 24:55.267
she crash landed, well...
3 minutes ago.

24:55.269 --> 24:56.735
Crash landed?

24:56.737 --> 24:58.670
Where?

24:58.672 --> 25:00.505
She's in
a pocket universe,

25:00.507 --> 25:01.973
a distorted echo
of our own.

25:01.975 --> 25:05.243
They happen sometimes,
but never last for long.

25:13.819 --> 25:15.353
Our universe.

25:15.355 --> 25:17.055
Hila Tacorian's here

25:17.057 --> 25:18.924
in a pocket universe.

25:18.926 --> 25:20.859
You're a lantern,

25:20.861 --> 25:22.460
shining across
the dimensions,

25:22.462 --> 25:24.629
guiding her home,
back to the land

25:24.631 --> 25:27.465
of the living.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.068
But what's she
running <i>from?</i>

25:30.070 --> 25:32.137
Well,
that's the best bit.

25:32.139 --> 25:34.472
We don't know, yet.
Shall we see?

25:39.345 --> 25:41.947
Oh.

25:43.916 --> 25:46.618
What is that?

25:46.620 --> 25:49.221
I don't know.

25:49.223 --> 25:51.756
Still,
not to worry.

25:51.758 --> 25:53.625
So what do we do?

25:53.627 --> 25:56.628
Not "we", you.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.230
You save
Hila Tacorian,

25:58.232 --> 26:00.065
because you are
Emma Grayling.

26:00.067 --> 26:02.234
You are a lantern.
The rest of us

26:02.236 --> 26:04.069
are just along for
the ride, I'm afraid.

26:05.871 --> 26:07.138
We need
some sturdy rope

26:07.140 --> 26:10.308
and a blue crystal
from Metebelis 3,

26:10.310 --> 26:12.077
plus, some
Kendal Mint Cake.

26:25.124 --> 26:26.625
Don't do it.

26:26.627 --> 26:28.593
I'm sorry?

26:28.595 --> 26:30.095
Nobody asked her
to risk her life.

26:30.097 --> 26:31.162
This woman,

26:31.164 --> 26:34.165
she doesn't
deserve --

26:34.167 --> 26:35.634
who-whoever she is,

26:35.636 --> 26:37.135
however brilliant,
however brave,

26:37.137 --> 26:38.603
she's not you, <i>she's</i>
<i>not worth risking</i>

26:38.605 --> 26:41.506
a single hair on
your head, not to me!

26:46.078 --> 26:47.612
Tell me what
I'm thinking.

26:49.783 --> 26:52.217
I can't.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.885
I don't have
your gift.

26:53.887 --> 26:58.790
You don't need it.

26:58.792 --> 27:00.292
Just look at me
and tell me.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.701
There you are.

27:09.703 --> 27:11.670
You read my mind.

27:15.141 --> 27:16.541
Can't you just,
you know --

27:16.543 --> 27:17.542
What?!

27:17.544 --> 27:19.878
Fly the TARDIS into
a parallel universe?

27:19.880 --> 27:21.680
Ah, it's not
a parallel universe,

27:21.682 --> 27:23.782
it's a pocket
universe.

27:23.784 --> 27:25.517
Plus,
it is collapsing.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.018
I mean,
the TARDIS

27:27.020 --> 27:28.687
could get in there
all right,

27:28.689 --> 27:30.088
but entropy
would bleed

27:30.090 --> 27:31.423
her power sources,
you see,

27:31.425 --> 27:34.626
trap her there until the
entire universe decayed

27:34.628 --> 27:36.995
back into
the quantum foam,

27:36.997 --> 27:39.364
which would take
about 3 minutes,

27:39.366 --> 27:41.132
give or take,
you know.

27:46.405 --> 27:47.839
What is that?

27:47.841 --> 27:50.275
Subset of the
Eye of Harmony.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.576
I don't --
Of course you don't.

27:51.578 --> 27:53.178
Be weird if you did.
I'd better do it myself.

27:53.180 --> 27:54.479
Right, you, sit down.

27:54.481 --> 27:56.981
All the way

27:56.983 --> 27:59.984
from Metebelis 3.

27:59.986 --> 28:02.153
What does it do?

28:02.155 --> 28:04.389
It amplifies your
natural abilities,

28:04.391 --> 28:07.492
like a microphone
or a pooper scooper.

28:09.429 --> 28:10.895
What, exactly,
is this arrangement?

28:10.897 --> 28:12.297
A psychochronograph.

28:12.299 --> 28:14.432
Forgive me,
but isn't it all

28:14.434 --> 28:16.401
a little bit, well,
"make do and mend"?

28:16.403 --> 28:18.403
Nonpsychic technology won't
work where I'm going.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.839
Listen -- all I need to do is
dive into another dimension,

28:20.841 --> 28:22.741
find the time traveler,
help her escape the monster,

28:22.743 --> 28:24.509
get home before the entire
dimension collapses,

28:24.511 --> 28:26.544
and Bob's your uncle.

28:26.546 --> 28:28.546
Doctor,
will it hurt?

28:28.548 --> 28:30.682
No.

28:30.684 --> 28:31.983
Well,

28:31.985 --> 28:34.719
yes, probably, a bit.
Well, quite a lot.

28:34.721 --> 28:36.654
I don't know.
It might be agony.

28:36.656 --> 28:38.817
To be perfectly honest,
I'll be interested to find out.

28:49.035 --> 28:51.002
I'm talking
to the lost soul

28:51.004 --> 28:52.570
that abides
in this place.

28:58.010 --> 29:00.445
I'm speaking
to Hila Tacorian.

29:10.489 --> 29:12.357
Huh-ah!

29:26.639 --> 29:28.640
You see?!

29:28.642 --> 29:31.342
The Witch
of the Well!

29:31.344 --> 29:34.412
It's a wormhole,
a reality whirl!

29:34.414 --> 29:36.314
A door to
the echo universe!

29:36.316 --> 29:37.615
Ready?!

29:37.617 --> 29:39.384
Ready!

29:45.091 --> 29:46.090
Geronimo.

29:47.693 --> 29:49.794
Whoa-oa-oa-oa!

29:52.331 --> 29:53.832
Aaaaah!

29:53.834 --> 29:56.000
Aaaaaaaaah!

29:56.002 --> 29:58.937
Doctor!

29:58.939 --> 30:00.505
Aaah-ah!

30:20.707 --> 30:22.708
Hila!

30:22.710 --> 30:24.243
Hila!

30:24.245 --> 30:26.745
Hila Tacorian!

30:51.238 --> 30:52.238
One.

30:53.507 --> 30:54.506
Two.

30:56.576 --> 30:58.210
Three!

30:58.212 --> 31:00.279
Help me-e-e!

31:00.281 --> 31:02.481
Hel-l-l-p!

31:04.385 --> 31:07.086
Aah! Hila Tacorian, I presume.
Who are you?

31:07.088 --> 31:08.488
Collapsing universe.
You and me, dead,

31:08.490 --> 31:10.790
2 minutes, no time,
complete sentences,

31:10.792 --> 31:12.525
abandon planet.
Wait!

31:14.095 --> 31:15.828
There's something
in the mist.

31:15.830 --> 31:17.864
Then run.

31:17.866 --> 31:18.865
Run!

31:24.638 --> 31:26.806
<i>Doctor!</i>

31:26.808 --> 31:28.074
<i>Doctor!</i>

31:28.076 --> 31:29.709
<i>Doctor!</i>

31:29.711 --> 31:31.844
<i>Doctor, come home!</i>

31:35.682 --> 31:38.251
Okay. Not that way,
which means,

31:38.253 --> 31:39.752
uh, probably --

31:39.754 --> 31:41.821
What's wrong?

31:41.823 --> 31:43.356
You know that exit
I mentioned?

31:43.358 --> 31:44.357
Yes.

31:44.359 --> 31:45.958
I seem to have
misplaced it.

31:55.736 --> 31:56.903
<i>Doctor!</i>

31:56.905 --> 31:58.438
This way.

31:58.440 --> 32:00.740
Doctor-or-or!

32:00.742 --> 32:02.341
Come home!

32:06.313 --> 32:07.947
<i>Doctor, we're here!</i>

32:07.949 --> 32:09.048
Whoa!
What's that?

32:09.050 --> 32:10.550
An echo house
in an echo universe.

32:10.552 --> 32:11.918
Clever, psychic.

32:11.920 --> 32:14.454
That is just
top-notch.

32:16.323 --> 32:18.124
Doctor!

32:22.397 --> 32:25.331
Doctor!

32:33.575 --> 32:35.241
It's looking
for a way in.

32:42.850 --> 32:44.917
I'm not
strong enough!

32:44.919 --> 32:46.719
Just a few
more seconds!

32:46.721 --> 32:48.721
Aaaah!
Aaaaaah!

32:54.928 --> 32:56.529
Grab the rope,

32:56.531 --> 32:58.164
give it three tugs,
quick as you like!

32:59.834 --> 33:02.268
What about you?!

33:02.270 --> 33:04.070
I'll be next!

33:26.895 --> 33:29.095

Ah.

39:36.711 --> 39:38.311

if that's...

39:40.115 --> 39:41.815
That's fine.

39:44.118 --> 39:46.119
You didn't come here
for the ghost, did you?

39:46.121 --> 39:47.721
No.

39:47.723 --> 39:49.322
You came here for me.
Yes.

39:49.324 --> 39:51.324
Why?
I needed to ask you something.

39:51.326 --> 39:52.626
Then ask.
Clara.

39:52.628 --> 39:53.927
Yes?

39:57.131 --> 39:58.331
What is she?

39:58.333 --> 40:00.267
She's a girl.

40:00.269 --> 40:01.870
Yes, but what kind
of girl, specifically?

40:03.438 --> 40:05.639
She's a perfectly
ordinary girl.

40:05.641 --> 40:07.908
Very pretty.

40:07.910 --> 40:08.909
Mm-hmm.

40:08.911 --> 40:10.010
Very clever.

40:10.012 --> 40:11.011
Mm-hmm.

40:11.013 --> 40:14.381
More scared
than she lets on.

40:14.383 --> 40:16.316
And that's it,
is it?

40:16.318 --> 40:18.085
Why, is that
not enough?

40:27.028 --> 40:28.628
Ohh!

40:28.630 --> 40:30.731
Where
will you go?

40:30.733 --> 40:32.466
He can't
take me home.

40:32.468 --> 40:34.134
History says
I went missing.

40:34.136 --> 40:35.802
But he can change
history.

40:35.804 --> 40:37.037
No! No no, I can't,
actually.

40:37.039 --> 40:39.372
There are fixed points
in time, you see.

40:39.374 --> 40:42.242
Ahem! Hi.
What?

40:42.244 --> 40:44.377
I knew you
were there.

40:44.379 --> 40:47.114
I could feel you.

40:47.116 --> 40:49.015
I know.

40:49.017 --> 40:51.351
Have we...?

40:51.353 --> 40:53.053
We can't have.

40:53.055 --> 40:54.688
You haven't even
been born yet.

40:54.690 --> 40:57.057
No, you can't have met,
but she can be

40:57.059 --> 41:01.561
your great-great-great-
great-great-granddaughter, eh?

41:01.563 --> 41:03.196
Yours, too, of course.

41:03.198 --> 41:05.432
But you guessed that
already, didn't you?

41:05.434 --> 41:08.401
Oh.

41:08.403 --> 41:10.036
Apparently not.

41:10.038 --> 41:11.505
The paradoxes...

41:11.507 --> 41:13.607
Resolve themselves,
by and large.

41:13.609 --> 41:15.675
That's why the psychic
link was so powerful --

41:15.677 --> 41:17.878
blood calling
to blood.

41:17.880 --> 41:20.013
Out of time.
Not everything ends, eh?

41:20.015 --> 41:22.349
Not love!
Not always!

41:22.351 --> 41:25.585
Doctor, what about,
um, ahem.

41:25.587 --> 41:26.987
What about us,
Emma and me?

41:26.989 --> 41:29.089
What about you?

41:29.091 --> 41:31.258
Well, what's
supposed to happen?

41:31.260 --> 41:32.559
I mean,
what do we do now?

41:32.561 --> 41:34.161
Hold hands.

41:34.163 --> 41:36.229
That's what you're
meant to do.

41:36.231 --> 41:38.465
Keep doing that
and don't let go.

41:38.467 --> 41:40.300
That's the secret.

41:44.138 --> 41:45.539
<i>Doctor!</i>

41:45.541 --> 41:48.408
<i>I'm not happy.</i>

41:48.410 --> 41:50.443
<i>Yeah, you need me</i>
<i>to piggyback you across.</i>

41:50.445 --> 41:52.445
<i>I'm not holding</i>
<i>your hand.</i>

41:52.447 --> 41:55.615
Oh, I'm so slow!

41:55.617 --> 41:57.150
I am slow.
I'm notorious for it.

41:57.152 --> 41:59.152
That's always been
my problem. But -- <i>but --</i>

41:59.154 --> 42:00.787
I get there, in the end.
Oh, yes.

42:00.789 --> 42:02.489
Doctor?
How do sharks make babies?

42:02.491 --> 42:04.191
Carefully.

42:04.193 --> 42:05.559
No. No no no no.
Happily.

42:05.561 --> 42:08.361
Sharks don't actually
smile. They're just --

42:08.363 --> 42:10.030
well, they've got lots and lots
of teeth. They're quite meaty.

42:10.032 --> 42:11.631
Exactly, but "birds
do it, bees do it,

42:11.633 --> 42:13.400
even educated
fleas do it".

42:13.402 --> 42:16.036
Every
lonely monster

42:16.038 --> 42:18.905
needs a companion.

42:18.907 --> 42:20.240
There's two
of them?!

42:22.678 --> 42:24.010
You know, it's the oldest
story in the universe --

42:24.012 --> 42:26.613
this one, or any other.
Boy and girl fall in love,

42:26.615 --> 42:28.415
get separated
by events --

42:28.417 --> 42:30.050
war, politics,
accidents in time --

42:30.052 --> 42:31.785
she's thrown out
of the hex

42:31.787 --> 42:34.120
or he's thrown
into it.

42:34.122 --> 42:36.690
Since then. They've been
yearning for each other

42:36.692 --> 42:38.959
across time and space,
across dimensions.

42:38.961 --> 42:41.228
This isn't
a ghost story,

42:41.230 --> 42:46.266
it's a love story.

42:46.268 --> 42:47.367
Sorry.

42:48.936 --> 42:50.704
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

42:50.706 --> 42:51.872
Sorry to interrupt
the rest of your life.

42:51.874 --> 42:55.175
So, tiny favor
to ask.

43:00.548 --> 43:02.249
I'm sorry!

43:02.251 --> 43:03.717
I understand now!

43:03.719 --> 43:06.052
I can take you to her!

43:06.054 --> 43:08.655
I can take you
to a safe place,

43:08.657 --> 43:10.123
far away from here!

43:10.125 --> 43:12.359
You can be together!

43:12.361 --> 43:14.895
Huh? Well,
come on, then,

43:14.897 --> 43:16.363
she's waiting!

43:25.740 --> 43:26.973
Well.

43:26.975 --> 43:29.643
Hello again,
you old Romeo, you.

43:29.645 --> 43:30.810
Now --

43:30.812 --> 43:32.779
Here she comes.

43:32.781 --> 43:35.382
Ha ha ha!
Whoo!

43:35.384 --> 43:36.917
Ahhhhhhh!

43:37.919 --> 43:39.419
Whoo!

43:39.421 --> 43:41.042
Get ready to jump.

43:41.067 --> 43:46.067
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

43:46.527 --> 43:49.129
Running away with
a spaceman in a box --

43:49.131 --> 43:50.263
anything could happen
to you.

43:50.265 --> 43:53.233
It's good salvage.
I can smell it.

43:53.235 --> 43:54.734
Clara.
Where is she?

43:54.736 --> 43:56.503
She's still onboard.

43:56.505 --> 43:58.104
If you help me get her out,
you get the machine,

43:58.106 --> 43:59.873
the salvage
of a lifetime.

43:59.875 --> 44:02.208
Multiple life forms
onboard the TARDIS.

44:02.210 --> 44:04.544
What do you keep
in here?!

44:04.546 --> 44:06.713
What are you, eh,
a trick, a trap?!

44:06.715 --> 44:08.682
We do what we came for --
tear the ship apart.

44:08.684 --> 44:10.583
If we're going to die here,
you're going to tell me

44:10.585 --> 44:12.886
what they are!
I can't.

44:12.888 --> 44:15.641
Where are we going?
The centre of the TARDIS.
