00:32.900 --> 00:36.100
You're totally slow dude! Speed up them gams!

00:36.350 --> 00:40.350
I'm not used to running on all fours.

00:40.300 --> 00:42.300
Ready to admit it's harder than it looks?

00:42.550 --> 00:44.050
I'll never admit anything to you.

00:44.300 --> 00:46.800
Hey, where'd you go?

00:50.550 --> 00:53.050
Ok, I admit. It's...it's harder than I thought.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.100
Actually you did pretty good.

00:56.350 --> 00:57.850
Hey, check it out!

00:58.100 --> 00:58.700
Whoa!

00:58.950 --> 01:00.450
Looks like a giant dead turtle.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.300
I think it's some kind of city of...

01:02.450 --> 01:03.950
Thieves!

01:04.200 --> 01:05.700
It's the city of thieves!

01:05.950 --> 01:07.750
Be warned, boy!

01:08.800 --> 01:13.100
All who enter the city are destined to become thieves themselves.

01:14.850 --> 01:16.350
Even you.

01:16.600 --> 01:18.600
I wouldn't become a thief lady.

01:18.850 --> 01:19.550
I'm a pretty good guy.

01:19.500 --> 01:22.300
Yeah, get your glasses on grandma.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.050
This kid is pure.

01:24.000 --> 01:26.300
In fact, he's about to help that little crying kid.

01:26.550 --> 01:27.550
Oh whoa.

01:27.600 --> 01:29.000
Be warned!

01:29.050 --> 01:30.050
Enough lady!

01:30.000 --> 01:32.100
Hey little girl, are you ok?

01:32.350 --> 01:33.950
Please, don't steal anything from me.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.800
Whoa! We wouldn't do that.

01:36.050 --> 01:36.950
We're heroes.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.800
We want to turn your frown...

01:38.850 --> 01:40.650
all the way around!

01:41.800 --> 01:42.700
Jake!

01:42.950 --> 01:45.950
I'll face the other way, but I'm gonna keep doing it.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.400
So, what's wrong?

01:48.850 --> 01:51.250
I was trying to sell my flowers out here in the desert

01:51.300 --> 01:54.000
when these two theives came and stole my whole basket

01:54.250 --> 01:55.650
then ran into the city.

01:55.500 --> 01:56.300
The city?

01:56.250 --> 01:57.250
Of thieves!

01:57.500 --> 01:58.500
Oh boy...

01:58.750 --> 02:00.450
Heed my warning boy

02:00.900 --> 02:03.900
enter the city, and you'll come out a thief.

02:04.250 --> 02:04.950
Never!

02:05.100 --> 02:06.600
I'll get this girl's flowers back!

02:06.550 --> 02:07.550
My name's Penny.

02:07.600 --> 02:08.699
I'll get Penny's flowers back

02:08.949 --> 02:11.350
and come out of that city as pure as the driven snow.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.800
Let's go Jake!

02:12.950 --> 02:14.950
Yeah! We're gonna purify that city!

01:46.950 --> 01:48.650
Oh, it was terrible!

02:19.300 --> 02:20.400
-Cool
-Crud

02:21.150 --> 02:22.150
My ring!

02:22.900 --> 02:23.900
Stop thief!

02:26.850 --> 02:27.750
Stop!

02:29.100 --> 02:30.200
My ruby!

02:30.450 --> 02:31.450
Stop baby!

02:31.800 --> 02:32.700
Don't steal!

02:34.150 --> 02:35.550
Don't steal Mr. Turtle.

02:35.600 --> 02:38.300
Finn, it's hopeless to try stopping a thief here.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.450
Everyone steals from each other.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.100
It's re-do-do-diculous.

02:42.150 --> 02:42.650
Penny!

02:42.700 --> 02:44.300
Never say that.

02:44.550 --> 02:45.850
Re-do-do-diculous?

02:45.900 --> 02:47.300
No, the whole thing you said

02:47.550 --> 02:48.450
about hopelessness.

02:48.700 --> 02:51.200
Cause I'm going to get your basket back from whoever took it.

02:51.450 --> 02:54.550
And then, I'm going to beat my purity into them!

02:54.800 --> 02:57.300
And then, I'm going to beat your purity out of them.

02:57.550 --> 02:59.050
And then, beat a sandwich into them.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.200
And then, beat them to the punch!

03:02.450 --> 03:03.950
And then, punch 'em.

03:03.900 --> 03:06.400
We can beat these thieves while we search for Penny's flower basket.

03:06.850 --> 03:07.950
Ok!

03:08.200 --> 03:09.500
Hey turd-ol!

03:09.550 --> 03:10.850
I'm gonna kick your butt

03:11.100 --> 03:13.500
Also, have you seen this little girl's flower basket?

03:13.750 --> 03:15.250
You're going down turtle.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.100
I want jets.

03:20.850 --> 03:22.050
Come back crossbow guy!

03:24.400 --> 03:25.000
My crossbow!

03:25.650 --> 03:27.950
Hey, my basket! That's my basket!

03:28.200 --> 03:29.000
Don't worry Penny.

03:29.150 --> 03:31.350
We'll get it right after I deal with this guy.

03:31.600 --> 03:33.300
Stealing's wrong, doofus!

03:39.750 --> 03:41.650
-My bro!
-My body!

03:42.900 --> 03:46.000
I'm gonna steal your flower basket, wizard!

03:46.750 --> 03:48.050
Pancake, pancake, pancake...

03:50.300 --> 03:51.300
Whoa brother!

03:52.050 --> 03:53.550
My glasses!

03:55.800 --> 03:57.200
My jammies!

03:58.250 --> 03:59.950
My glasses!

04:01.100 --> 04:02.000
There it goes!

04:03.250 --> 04:05.450
I will smite thee! Goblin thief.

04:05.900 --> 04:07.100
You stole that basket from me.

04:07.250 --> 04:08.450
No I didn't!

04:08.300 --> 04:09.600
Hey, give me that!

04:09.750 --> 04:10.650
I stole it first!

04:10.800 --> 04:12.300
I'll use my sword on you!

04:12.450 --> 04:13.350
Hey!

04:13.600 --> 04:14.300
You there!

04:14.350 --> 04:18.050
It's time to step inside the purification chamber son!

04:34.100 --> 04:37.600
How are we supposed to get that basket back if it keeps being stolen?

04:38.750 --> 04:40.750
Hey! We could steal a new one from that guy.

04:41.300 --> 04:42.700
He's got lots of flower baskets

04:43.350 --> 04:44.050
and boots!

04:18.300 --> 04:19.800
Hey!

04:44.650 --> 04:47.750
I'd like to steal me one of them pairs of boots especially.

04:48.000 --> 04:48.400
No Jake

04:48.650 --> 04:49.750
We can't steal.

04:50.000 --> 04:51.500
We have to stay pure!

04:51.750 --> 04:52.750
OK...

04:53.400 --> 04:54.500
I have an idea.

04:54.350 --> 04:57.450
My mom used to tell me that there's a king of thieves

04:57.700 --> 04:59.200
who lives in the center of the city

04:59.450 --> 05:01.650
and everything that gets stolen from little girls

05:02.000 --> 05:03.400
ends up at his tower

05:03.850 --> 05:06.250
Maybe we'd find my basket in his treasure chest!

05:06.300 --> 05:08.000
That's a great idea Penny!

05:08.150 --> 05:09.250
There's one thing though.

05:09.400 --> 05:13.000
The tower that he lives in is surrounded by a magical barrier

05:13.250 --> 05:15.350
Which magically keeps thieves out.

05:15.800 --> 05:16.700
Have you forgotten?

05:17.150 --> 05:18.250
We three ain't thieves.

05:18.300 --> 05:19.100
We're pure!

05:19.650 --> 05:21.150
Right Jake? Jake?

05:21.600 --> 05:23.800
Just gotta steal these boots...

05:24.050 --> 05:24.850
Jake!

05:25.400 --> 05:26.600
Hey! Go away!

05:26.850 --> 05:28.150
What are you doing man?

05:28.400 --> 05:29.300
It's the city.

05:29.550 --> 05:30.550
It's getting to me.

05:30.800 --> 05:32.000
Help me Finn!

05:32.250 --> 05:33.550
I'm here for you buddy!

05:33.500 --> 05:34.600
Thank you, Finn

05:34.850 --> 05:35.650
Thank you

05:37.200 --> 05:38.200
No!

05:39.250 --> 05:41.750
I won't...let you...become...a thief!

05:42.700 --> 05:44.400
Uh...What are these?

05:44.650 --> 05:45.450
Bells.

05:45.700 --> 05:47.700
That way, I'll hear if you try to steal again.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.450
Oh. Mm.

05:51.500 --> 05:53.400
The king of thieves tower is right up here.

05:56.150 --> 05:56.950
Whoa.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.100
You ready to pass through Penny?

06:02.350 --> 06:03.150
I'm too afraid.

06:03.400 --> 06:04.900
Is it OK if I wait out here?

06:05.150 --> 06:05.750
Sure.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.500
C'mon! Let's go Jake!

06:09.150 --> 06:10.050
Coming...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.500
Jake..Where'd you get those boots?

06:14.150 --> 06:15.250
Huh? What? What boots?

06:16.300 --> 06:22.400
Oh no! I stole! The city! It took advantage of me!

06:22.850 --> 06:26.650
Ah Jake. You're a thief now. You won't be able to get in anymore.

06:26.900 --> 06:28.400
Yes, I can.

06:28.650 --> 06:30.150
Oh. Huh.

06:30.400 --> 06:30.900
<sigh>

06:31.650 --> 06:32.650
It's up to me now.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.900
Legend says, you'll find the loot in the king of thieves chest.

06:37.150 --> 06:40.950
Good luck Finn! Oh yeah, and that high window is the only entrance.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.900
Hmm. Alright, wish me luck.

06:43.150 --> 06:44.450
She already did, man.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.400
Oh. Yeah. Right.

06:50.150 --> 06:52.050
Whoo! Yeah, Finn!

06:54.800 --> 06:56.800
Great. Now I gotta climb down?

07:03.850 --> 07:06.150
Whoa! The king of thieves...

07:06.400 --> 07:10.000
Uh..sorry to trespass...I just...

07:10.250 --> 07:11.750
Uh..hello?

07:13.200 --> 07:15.300
The chest! It's in his chest!

07:18.150 --> 07:19.050
Thanks!

07:20.100 --> 07:24.100
You see, if you have too much earwax, you won't be able to hear anymore.

07:24.250 --> 07:25.650
I got it guys!

07:25.700 --> 07:27.600
The chest! Give me that.

07:28.750 --> 07:31.150
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy kid...

07:36.700 --> 07:39.600
What? Is your basket under all that gold?

07:39.850 --> 07:40.850
Of course it's not.

07:41.100 --> 07:43.200
I set you up to steal this chest of gold.

07:43.450 --> 07:46.450
I couldn't get past the barrier 'cause I'm a thief.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.200
But you're just a cute little girl.

07:48.450 --> 07:49.750
And I'm a thief!

07:50.000 --> 07:53.500
We'll if this isn't yours, I'm going to return it right now!

07:55.450 --> 07:56.450
Huh?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.100
Why can't I...

08:02.350 --> 08:03.850
You stole something in the city.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.400
Now you're a thief!

08:05.450 --> 08:07.350
No. Noooo!

08:08.200 --> 08:11.000
What have I done? What have I become?

08:11.150 --> 08:13.150
You've become a thief, stupid.

08:15.700 --> 08:17.500
My hands. They're all dirty.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.550
Covered in the dust of a criminal act.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.300
I'm a thief...

08:25.050 --> 08:27.650
Ohhh. What did I tell you boy?

08:27.900 --> 08:31.600
This city will get you, no matter how pure you think you are.

08:34.450 --> 08:34.950
I was right.

08:35.200 --> 08:37.100
Hey. That's enough from you, hag!

08:37.350 --> 08:38.850
Agh. Hey!

08:39.299 --> 08:40.000
Finn?

08:40.450 --> 08:41.450
Don't touch me!

08:41.600 --> 08:42.600
I'm impure man!

08:42.850 --> 08:46.150
Unfit to be a hero. Unfit to be your friend.

08:46.400 --> 08:47.900
C'mon Finn. Keep it together.

08:48.150 --> 08:51.650
No, Jake. This is a one-way path down a jacked up road.

08:51.900 --> 08:53.400
And I gotta walk it...

08:53.650 --> 08:55.150
alone...

08:55.400 --> 08:57.400
I'm not gonna leave you alone in the city.

08:57.650 --> 08:58.650
You're my buddy.

08:58.900 --> 09:00.800
Besides, I stole these boots.

09:01.050 --> 09:03.550
These super, big style boots.

09:03.800 --> 09:06.000
So I'm just as dirty as you are Finn.

09:06.250 --> 09:08.750
We gotta walk this filthy path together.

09:09.000 --> 09:12.100
Then we shall embrace the darkness of this wicked city

09:12.250 --> 09:16.250
and use the methods of the criminal to seek vengence on Penny.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.000
Cowabunga!

09:19.950 --> 09:21.550
Cowabunga indeed.

09:33.900 --> 09:34.900
Yah!

09:36.650 --> 09:39.750
Mmm. Yes. Yeah.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.900
Wha? Is someone there?

09:43.050 --> 09:44.550
Hmm. Heh.

09:44.400 --> 09:45.100
Penny.

09:45.550 --> 09:45.950
Huh?

09:46.200 --> 09:48.100
It's me, Penny.

09:48.350 --> 09:50.650
The hero whose purity you stole.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.300
And I'm here to enact my revenge upon you!

09:56.150 --> 09:56.950
Hi Penny!

09:57.000 --> 09:58.700
Finn, please don't punch my lights out.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.150
I'm just a poor, homeless, baby girl.

10:01.300 --> 10:02.900
I trusted you Penny.

10:03.150 --> 10:04.150
You made me steal.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.600
And you took my purity.

10:06.050 --> 10:07.650
You ruined me!

10:07.700 --> 10:12.200
I'm sorry Finn. Let me give you some gems or some gold

10:12.450 --> 10:14.750
Or uh..have some knife in your neck!

10:15.100 --> 10:16.800
Watch out Finn!

10:18.950 --> 10:19.350
Thanks dude!

10:19.500 --> 10:20.300
Yeah dude!

10:20.550 --> 10:25.650
You may have soiled my purity, but I think you can still come out clean.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.500
Come on Jake!

10:28.450 --> 10:29.550
Nooo! No!

10:33.200 --> 10:34.500
Nice work dude!

10:34.750 --> 10:36.050
She's purified.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.700
I feel clean!

10:37.950 --> 10:40.950
Like all the filth of the city and wrong doings are gone!

10:41.200 --> 10:42.000
Thank you F and J.

10:42.250 --> 10:43.650
I haven't felt like this since I was young.

10:43.900 --> 10:45.300
You're welcome.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.650
Whoa dude!

10:47.400 --> 10:48.900
The soap got on us too!

10:49.150 --> 10:50.050
We're clean!

10:50.300 --> 10:50.900
-Yes!
-Yes!

10:51.150 --> 10:53.950
This good deed we did has purified us once again.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.700
We're virgin islands!

10:58.150 --> 11:00.750
Finn, thank you for the second chance to live a purer life.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.700
And you know what that means Penny.

11:02.950 --> 11:04.450
No. More. Stealing.

11:05.900 --> 11:08.600
Well. I think it's time for us to get the math out of here.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.200
Never again.

11:08.950 --> 11:10.250
I'm going to miss you Finn!

11:10.500 --> 11:11.300
I'll miss you too.

11:11.550 --> 11:12.250
Goodbye!

11:13.900 --> 11:15.900
Whoa dude. Why are you naked?

11:16.350 --> 11:18.150
Ah! Pennnny!
