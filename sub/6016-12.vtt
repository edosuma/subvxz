00:01.209 --> 00:02.795
So I went to a fashion show.

00:02.795 --> 00:05.130
First of all,

00:02.795 --> 00:05.130
the whole concept of modeling

00:05.130 --> 00:07.341
is counterproductive

00:05.130 --> 00:07.341
to the fashion industry.

00:07.341 --> 00:10.260
When these women are around,

00:07.341 --> 00:10.260
who's looking at clothes?

00:10.260 --> 00:11.971
I didn't notice

00:10.260 --> 00:11.971
any of the clothes.

00:11.971 --> 00:14.431
We're all applauding. "Yeah!"

00:11.971 --> 00:14.431
What are we applauding?

00:14.431 --> 00:16.266
We're applauding, "There's

00:14.431 --> 00:16.266
great-looking women here.

00:16.266 --> 00:17.810
Yeah, this is great!"

00:17.810 --> 00:19.269
"I'm glad I'm here in this room

00:19.269 --> 00:20.855
with all these

00:19.269 --> 00:20.855

Anybody can design a shirt.

00:22.397 --> 00:25.400
It takes talent to get

00:22.397 --> 00:25.400
all these girls in one spot.

00:25.400 --> 00:26.777
That's talent.

What is this goofy walk

00:26.777 --> 00:29.279
that the models do?

00:29.279 --> 00:31.907
You know this walk that they do

00:29.279 --> 00:31.907
down the runway.

00:31.907 --> 00:33.492
This-- They have

00:31.907 --> 00:33.492
to go somewhere.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.160
They're walking

00:33.492 --> 00:35.160

00:35.160 --> 00:37.371
Like they're on the way

00:35.160 --> 00:37.371
somewhere, you know?

00:37.371 --> 00:40.081
And then they get to the end,

00:37.371 --> 00:40.081
and it's like...

00:40.081 --> 00:42.376
"Well, I guess

00:40.081 --> 00:42.376
I'll just go back."

20:04.120 --> 20:05.538
athletic

20:05.538 --> 20:07.707
and without a trace

20:05.538 --> 20:07.707
of self-consciousness.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.292
MAN:

20:07.707 --> 20:10.292
His buttocks are sublime.

20:10.292 --> 20:12.336
Of course, his pectorals

20:10.292 --> 20:12.336
could use a little work.

20:12.336 --> 20:14.296
I suppose we could get him

20:12.336 --> 20:14.296
into the weight room.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.132
No, let's get him

20:14.296 --> 20:16.132
in the studio today.

20:16.132 --> 20:18.092
We could send these

20:16.132 --> 20:18.092
out immediately.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.974
You've done it

20:22.055 --> 20:24.974
again, C.K.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.392
And what if I did

20:24.974 --> 20:26.392
do it--

20:26.392 --> 20:28.519
Though I admit to nothing

20:26.392 --> 20:28.519
and never will--

20:28.519 --> 20:30.188
What does that make me?

20:30.188 --> 20:32.148
And I'm not here

20:30.188 --> 20:32.148
just defending myself,

20:32.148 --> 20:34.358
but all those pickers

20:32.148 --> 20:34.358
who've been caught...

20:34.358 --> 20:36.819
each and every one of them

20:36.819 --> 20:39.321
who has to suffer

20:36.819 --> 20:39.321
the shame and humiliation

20:39.321 --> 20:42.282
because of people

20:39.321 --> 20:42.282
like you.

20:42.282 --> 20:43.868
Are we not human?

20:43.868 --> 20:46.996
If we pick,

20:43.868 --> 20:46.996
do we not bleed?

20:49.289 --> 20:52.376
I am not an animal!

20:52.376 --> 20:54.712
I did not bare myself

20:52.376 --> 20:54.712
deliberately,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.297
but I tell you,

20:54.712 --> 20:57.297
I wish now that I had.

20:57.297 --> 20:59.926
Because it is not me

20:57.297 --> 20:59.926
that has been exposed,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.260
but you!

21:01.260 --> 21:04.430
For I have seen the nipple

21:01.260 --> 21:04.430
on your soul!

21:04.430 --> 21:07.016
[♪♪♪]

21:07.016 --> 21:09.685
So the minute I started

21:07.016 --> 21:09.685
up the steps to her apartment,

21:09.685 --> 21:11.562
I knew I made

21:09.685 --> 21:11.562
a terrible mistake...

21:12.939 --> 21:13.981
going back with her.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.609
So we're in her apartment.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.194
She goes into the bathroom.

21:18.194 --> 21:21.781
I'm cursing myself. Now,

21:18.194 --> 21:21.781
how do I get out of there?

21:21.781 --> 21:25.201
And then it hits me

21:21.781 --> 21:25.201
like a bolt of lightning:

21:25.201 --> 21:26.994
The pick.

21:28.996 --> 21:30.623
The pick?

21:30.623 --> 21:34.043
She comes out of the bathroom,

21:30.623 --> 21:34.043
I'm in up to my wrist.

21:36.712 --> 21:39.799
You should have seen

21:36.712 --> 21:39.799
the look on her face.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.468
I think I've seen

21:39.799 --> 21:42.468
that look.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.471
Hey, I got

21:44.053 --> 21:45.471
the magazine.

21:45.471 --> 21:46.931
The underwear ad came out.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.682
Hey, Calvin Klein!

21:48.682 --> 21:49.683
Wow!

21:49.683 --> 21:51.351
Hey, you look great!

21:51.351 --> 21:53.020
Ooh, neat.

21:53.020 --> 21:55.106
Boy, they really worked

21:53.020 --> 21:55.106
on your pectorals.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.067
Well... Whoopee.

21:55.106 --> 21:58.067
Your buttocks are spectacular.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.318
Oh, my.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.279
What?

22:01.279 --> 22:04.782
Well, I'm not sure,

22:01.279 --> 22:04.782
but...

22:04.782 --> 22:08.202
I think I see your...

22:08.202 --> 22:10.121
The human body

22:08.202 --> 22:10.121
is a lot of maintenance.

22:10.121 --> 22:12.290
It's a lot of showering,

22:10.121 --> 22:12.290
a lot of shaving,

22:12.290 --> 22:15.001
a lot of cleaning, a lot

22:12.290 --> 22:15.001
of clipping, a lot of checking.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.170
If your body was a car,

22:15.001 --> 22:17.170
you wouldn't buy it.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.173
It's too much upkeep.

22:17.170 --> 22:20.173
It's a pain.

22:20.173 --> 22:22.758
But women definitely go

22:20.173 --> 22:22.758
to the absolute extreme.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.594
To me, it's amazing

22:22.758 --> 22:25.594
the way women take care

22:25.594 --> 22:27.596
of all the hair

22:25.594 --> 22:27.596
on their bodies.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.057
One of the great mysteries to me

22:30.057 --> 22:33.311
is the fact that a woman

22:30.057 --> 22:33.311
could pour hot wax on her legs,

22:33.311 --> 22:35.521
rip the hair out by the root

22:35.521 --> 22:37.397
and still be afraid of a spider.

22:37.397 --> 22:39.566
