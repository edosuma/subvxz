00:01.970 --> 00:03.370
Previously on "one tree hill"...

00:07.704 --> 00:09.370
Do you know what's missing?

00:09.403 --> 00:10.771
Cash from the register

00:10.804 --> 00:12.971
And the sketches for my new line.

00:13.004 --> 00:15.704
I don't trust you or like you.

00:15.737 --> 00:18.270
So how about you stay out of my bed

00:18.303 --> 00:20.871
And stay away from marvin?

00:20.904 --> 00:22.937
You need to convince
lucas to do the movie.

00:22.971 --> 00:25.171
And you'll make it the
movie he wants it to be.

00:25.204 --> 00:26.670
Absolutely.

00:26.704 --> 00:29.370
Hey, nate. I'm happy
to be a part of it, man.

00:29.403 --> 00:30.537
What's that?

00:30.570 --> 00:32.337
The comeback.

00:32.369 --> 00:34.204
Don't call it a comeback, man.

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074

of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:48.337 --> 00:51.670
A little old man and i fell out.

00:51.704 --> 00:54.504
I'll tell you what it was all about.

00:54.537 --> 00:58.403
He had money, and i had none,

00:58.437 --> 01:02.904
And that's the way the noise begun.

01:08.303 --> 01:09.303
74.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.570
Sure?

01:10.604 --> 01:12.303
Yep. 74 inches, daddy.

01:12.337 --> 01:13.937
6'2".

01:13.971 --> 01:15.138
I can measure again.

01:15.171 --> 01:16.403
No.

01:16.437 --> 01:17.804
It's okay.

01:17.837 --> 01:19.670
I've been 6'2" since i was 17.

01:19.704 --> 01:20.904
Is that bad?

01:20.937 --> 01:23.904
Well, if i was 6'5", i
might be in the pros by now.

01:23.937 --> 01:25.804
What if you were 8'5"?

01:26.871 --> 01:28.470
I'd probably be dead of heart failure.

01:28.504 --> 01:31.071
Well, i think 6'2" is perfect.

01:31.104 --> 01:33.637
Heck, i'd settle for 4'2".

01:33.670 --> 01:36.470
Well, you can thank your
short-Pants mom for that. Hey!

01:36.504 --> 01:38.104
He got some good stuff from me,

01:38.138 --> 01:41.004
Like the piano he's gonna rock
at the talent show tonight, huh?

01:41.037 --> 01:42.570
Huh? Yeah.

01:42.604 --> 01:44.437
Are you gonna be there, daddy?

01:44.470 --> 01:45.737
I wouldn't miss it.

01:45.771 --> 01:47.470
I wish i could come with you today.

01:47.504 --> 01:48.737
I know.

01:48.771 --> 01:52.204
I tell you what ...  i'll
tell you all about it, okay?

01:52.238 --> 01:54.138
And this idea you have?

01:54.171 --> 01:56.171
It's what you want to do?

01:56.204 --> 01:58.138
It's what i have to do.

02:01.303 --> 02:04.204
Sam! Breakfast!

02:18.004 --> 02:19.204
Hi.

02:19.238 --> 02:23.238
He spent the night in your bed?

02:23.270 --> 02:24.971
In my house?!

02:25.004 --> 02:27.737
Well, i thought it was
out time a guy stayed here.

02:27.771 --> 02:30.071
Watch yourself.

02:30.104 --> 02:32.604
Look, he's my friend, and
he lives with s brother.

02:32.637 --> 02:34.670
And he just ...  he
beats on him sometimes,

02:34.704 --> 02:36.303
And he needed a place to crash.

02:38.071 --> 02:39.871
Okay.

02:39.904 --> 02:42.171
Does this half-Nude,
window-Fleeing friend

02:42.204 --> 02:43.337
Have a name?

02:45.238 --> 02:46.937
Jack daniels.

02:48.337 --> 02:50.971
John "jack" daniels.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.837
You expect me to believe that a boy

02:52.871 --> 02:55.504
Named after the
white-Trash-Rock-Band drink of choice

02:55.537 --> 02:59.138
Spent the night in your
bed and nothing happened?

02:59.171 --> 03:00.871
Dude, i'm like 15.

03:00.904 --> 03:03.704
Like that matters! When i was 15 ...

03:06.637 --> 03:07.904
Never mind.

03:09.370 --> 03:12.104
Tell me when someone
is staying in my house,

03:12.138 --> 03:15.204
And if your friend needs
a place to "crash" again,

03:15.238 --> 03:17.771
He can sleep on the couch!

03:17.804 --> 03:19.704
Now just...

03:19.737 --> 03:21.637
Go do something.

03:28.537 --> 03:30.037
Hi, luke.

03:30.071 --> 03:32.937
I'll stay on the movie...
because it matters to me.

03:32.971 --> 03:34.771
But you and i are not friends,

03:34.804 --> 03:37.737
And you d peyton aren't anything.

03:38.871 --> 03:41.238
How is our girl peyton?

03:41.270 --> 03:44.370
And how long have you been
experiencing this pain?

03:44.403 --> 03:45.670
A few days.

03:45.704 --> 03:48.303
Any history of diabetes
in the family? Ulcers?

03:48.337 --> 03:50.737
Um...no.

03:50.771 --> 03:52.138
Cancer?

03:52.171 --> 03:55.270
My birth mother died of cancer. Why?

03:55.303 --> 03:57.704
What ...  what's the
face that you're making?

03:57.737 --> 04:00.270
We just want to run some tests.

04:00.303 --> 04:02.138
Consider it a test.

04:02.171 --> 04:04.537
You fly to los angeles,
and while you're gone,

04:04.570 --> 04:06.904
If peyton doesn't fall
in love with me again,

04:06.937 --> 04:10.270
Then you'll know you
two were meant to be.

04:10.303 --> 04:12.504
You're a dick. You know that?

04:14.171 --> 04:16.971
Listen, the truth is, this
guy's an a-List director.

04:17.004 --> 04:19.971
He's got several offers, and
you need to meet with him.

04:20.004 --> 04:21.238
Today? Why?

04:21.269 --> 04:23.971
Because i told you we'd be
equal partners on this movie,

04:24.004 --> 04:26.104
And i need you to sign off on him.

04:26.138 --> 04:27.670
What are you gonna do?

04:27.704 --> 04:29.804
I'm producing a movie, luke.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.337
Contrary to popular belief,

04:31.370 --> 04:33.804
I'm not staying in town
to hit on your fiancÃ©e.

04:35.504 --> 04:37.037
It's your book.

04:48.138 --> 04:50.071
What?

04:50.104 --> 04:52.570
You just froze there,
halfway out the window.

04:52.604 --> 04:54.270
You looked like such a dork.

04:54.303 --> 04:56.037
Well, you're the one who
didn't set the alarm right.

04:56.071 --> 04:59.004
Whatever. She thought we were doing it.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.104
As if.

05:00.138 --> 05:01.871
What do you mean, "as if"?

05:01.904 --> 05:04.104
A lot of girls would do it with me.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.537
Yeah.

05:05.570 --> 05:07.138
But those girls are called prostitutes.

05:09.104 --> 05:10.604
Why?

05:13.238 --> 05:15.171
Hi.

05:15.204 --> 05:16.804
Producer guy, right?

05:16.837 --> 05:19.238
Orphan girl, right? From the concert?

05:19.270 --> 05:21.004
Sam. Julian.

05:21.037 --> 05:22.904
I know.

05:22.937 --> 05:24.303
You can help me.

05:24.337 --> 05:26.804
Good. You can help me, too.

05:29.871 --> 05:33.071
So, what happens at
this... what do you call it?

05:33.104 --> 05:34.504
It's called a combine.

05:34.537 --> 05:36.971
Coaches and scouts from the
pro teams come watch you play.

05:37.004 --> 05:38.904
And they pick you for the nba?

05:42.204 --> 05:43.837
You find them yet? No.

05:43.871 --> 05:47.071
Hey, i think you should
wear the number 12 next.

05:47.104 --> 05:48.171
Why?

05:48.204 --> 05:49.771
I don't know. I like the number 12.

05:49.804 --> 05:52.037
That's what i'm gonna
wear when i'm in the pros.

05:52.071 --> 05:54.670
All right. Okay, i found them.

05:54.704 --> 05:56.937
Oh, good.

05:56.971 --> 05:59.570
These are really ugly, dad.

05:59.604 --> 06:00.804
Well, they made a few models,

06:00.837 --> 06:02.403
So just pick one you
like, you knucklehead.

06:02.437 --> 06:05.238
Okay.

06:05.270 --> 06:06.737
So, your mom's pretty excited

06:06.771 --> 06:09.171
About you playing the piano
at your talent show tonight.

06:09.204 --> 06:10.171
I know.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.837
You don't sound very pumped up.

06:11.871 --> 06:14.004
I just kind of wanted to tell jokes.

06:14.037 --> 06:15.771
Dude, i've heard your jokes.

06:15.804 --> 06:17.504
Trust me, stick with the piano.

06:17.537 --> 06:21.537
But the song is a kiddy song,
and i'm not very good at it.

06:21.570 --> 06:24.971
Well, all you can do is
the best you can, all right?

06:25.004 --> 06:27.004
That's all that matters.

06:27.037 --> 06:28.637
Speaking of which,

06:28.670 --> 06:31.370
Are you telling me you can't
find those shoes by now?

06:31.403 --> 06:33.270
Oh, i found the shoes a long time ago.

06:33.303 --> 06:34.403
I just like it up here.

06:38.837 --> 06:40.537
We found the shoes.

06:40.570 --> 06:41.904
Yay!

06:41.937 --> 06:43.871
All set?

06:43.904 --> 06:45.537
Yeah.

06:47.303 --> 06:48.904
All right.

06:48.937 --> 06:50.238
See you at the talent show.

06:50.270 --> 06:52.737
Go be great.

06:52.771 --> 06:55.570
Love you.

06:55.604 --> 06:56.871
Love you.

06:59.704 --> 07:01.837
Daddy.

07:01.871 --> 07:03.937
All you can do is your best, okay?

07:15.037 --> 07:16.771
You want some coffee with that sugar?

07:16.804 --> 07:18.437
How do you take yours?

07:18.471 --> 07:20.838
I don't. Never touch the stuff.

07:20.870 --> 07:23.870
So, you said i could
help you out. How so?

07:23.903 --> 07:26.104
I was thinking, um,

07:26.137 --> 07:28.070
Maybe you could read
some of the stuff i wrote.

07:28.104 --> 07:29.604
You're a screenwriter?

07:29.637 --> 07:30.838
I just write things.

07:30.870 --> 07:32.937
I get a little pissed
off sometimes, you know?

07:34.304 --> 07:37.371
Okay. Tell me about brooke davis.

07:37.404 --> 07:39.937
Dude, i am so not hooking you two up.

07:39.970 --> 07:42.604
No, no, her clothing
line. Is she any good?

07:42.637 --> 07:45.204
Yeah. Think you'd be lucky to have her.

07:45.237 --> 07:48.237
For the movie, right?
That's why you're asking?

07:48.270 --> 07:50.471
Give me your phone.

07:50.504 --> 07:53.037
This is my number.

07:53.070 --> 07:55.504
I'm happy to read anything
you want to send me.

07:55.537 --> 07:56.604
You'd do that?

07:56.637 --> 07:58.704
I mean, i just kind
of heard you're a dick.

07:58.738 --> 08:00.270
I am.

08:00.304 --> 08:02.738
But maybe i'll read
something i can steal.

08:02.771 --> 08:04.371
I got this.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.304
Hey, is she single ...  brooke?

08:09.337 --> 08:10.738
No.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.104
Yeah.

08:16.003 --> 08:18.903
You know, i'm betting
you're actually nice.

08:18.937 --> 08:21.270
And i'm betting you're not bitter.

08:21.304 --> 08:22.604
Keep writing, sam.

08:24.704 --> 08:26.704
She's out of your league, my brother.

08:42.104 --> 08:43.671
I told gigi to stay away from marvin,

08:43.703 --> 08:44.771
And the next thing i know,

08:44.804 --> 08:47.437
She's hugging him in the parking lot.

08:47.471 --> 08:49.637
What were you doing in the parking lot?

08:49.671 --> 08:51.471
Spying.

08:51.504 --> 08:53.738
Well, what am i supposed to do?

08:53.771 --> 08:55.437
She's a horny college party girl.

08:55.471 --> 08:58.437
Millie, he's amused by her.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.671
So, i don't want a guy who's
amused by someone like that.

09:01.704 --> 09:03.504
Okay.

09:05.137 --> 09:09.471
I know those girls...
because i've been those girls.

09:09.504 --> 09:13.604
And all guys are amused by it.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.571
It doesn't mean anything.

09:15.604 --> 09:18.304
Mouth is not gonna fall for that.

09:18.337 --> 09:21.471
He's not.

09:23.671 --> 09:27.137
Trust me, she's harmless.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.903
You ever think about
having sex on the news desk?

09:29.937 --> 09:31.003
No.

09:31.037 --> 09:33.070
Maybe.

09:33.104 --> 09:34.504
What are you doing?

09:34.537 --> 09:36.537
Well, the news team is
on location, so chris said

09:36.571 --> 09:38.571
I could have my going-Away
party in here tonight.

09:38.604 --> 09:39.804
6:30 okay?

09:39.838 --> 09:41.937
Actually, i have to go
to jamie's talent show.

09:41.970 --> 09:45.003
I'm totally not having my
going-Away party without you.

09:45.037 --> 09:47.070
Please.

09:47.104 --> 09:50.838
One drink. I wouldn't miss it.

09:52.204 --> 09:53.804
You're gonna have to miss it.

09:53.838 --> 09:55.037
Peyton, come on!

09:55.070 --> 09:57.738
You have to get back into the studio.

09:57.771 --> 10:00.170
Mia, i'm being very serious, okay?

10:00.204 --> 10:03.070
I'm so proud of you, and
the first record did great.

10:03.104 --> 10:06.237
But our label friend, john,
who i do not have a thing for,

10:06.270 --> 10:08.838
Is getting very impatient
for the next one,

10:08.870 --> 10:12.003
So just tell me that you
have been working on the demos

10:12.037 --> 10:13.270
I asked you to do.

10:13.304 --> 10:15.571
Peyton, i've had a lot going on.

10:15.604 --> 10:17.070
Okay, fine.

10:17.104 --> 10:19.237
How many songs do you have?

10:23.404 --> 10:26.204
I have a couple ideas.

10:28.337 --> 10:29.970
All right.

10:30.003 --> 10:33.704
The label would like for
you to listen to this.

10:33.738 --> 10:35.204
What for?

10:35.237 --> 10:37.137
Because there are some very talented,

10:37.170 --> 10:39.003
Very expensive songwriters on there,

10:39.037 --> 10:41.204
And they want you to
pick a track to record.

10:41.237 --> 10:43.371
But i write my own songs.

10:43.404 --> 10:44.537
Apparently not.

10:44.571 --> 10:46.804
Apparently, you just
write a couple ideas.

10:49.504 --> 10:52.270
Hello? Hi.

10:52.304 --> 10:54.738
Oh, luke. Hi, honey. I'm sorry.

10:54.771 --> 10:58.104
No, no, no, i was just
expecting another call.

10:58.137 --> 11:01.037
Yeah. No, i had to leave
really early this morning.

11:01.070 --> 11:03.771
Um, i had a ...  like
a meeting with a band.

11:05.404 --> 11:08.404
Can you hold on one second? Okay.

11:08.437 --> 11:10.504
Please, just listen to that.

11:11.537 --> 11:15.804
Hi, okay. Sorry.

11:15.838 --> 11:19.037
L.A.? Why are you going to l.A.?

11:27.804 --> 11:30.270
Name and affiliation?

11:30.304 --> 11:32.604
Nathan scott, university of maryland.

11:32.637 --> 11:34.104
Professional affiliation.

11:34.137 --> 11:37.471
Who invited you to the combine?

11:37.504 --> 11:39.337
No one did, sir.

11:39.371 --> 11:42.504
These are professional trials,
son ...  invitation only.

11:42.537 --> 11:43.838
I understand that.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.771
Look, i was an all-American
at maryland last season,

11:47.804 --> 11:50.270
And i was just hoping that...

11:55.371 --> 11:57.204
Look, this is kind of my last shot.

11:57.237 --> 12:00.070
Didn't you get thrown through a window?

12:04.204 --> 12:05.504
Please.

12:05.537 --> 12:07.970
I'm sorry. You can't be here.

12:15.070 --> 12:16.604
Nathan.

12:22.304 --> 12:23.604
He's with us.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.070
Better go suit up.

13:07.104 --> 13:08.870
"Breakfast club." You were the priss.

13:08.904 --> 13:11.603
Let me guess. You were the stoner?

13:11.637 --> 13:14.071
Well, if you say so.
They end up together.

13:14.104 --> 13:16.670
Can i help you?

13:16.703 --> 13:19.337
You should design the
wardrobe for the movie.

13:19.371 --> 13:21.937
I'm not a costume designer.

13:21.970 --> 13:23.937
Oh. I can see that.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.204
I'm starting a new line.

13:25.237 --> 13:28.371
Well, okay, let me try this again.

13:28.404 --> 13:30.570
You should design the
wardrobe for the movie.

13:30.603 --> 13:32.037
You were there, it's authentic,

13:32.071 --> 13:34.271
It's press-Worthy, and i
would be lucky to have you

13:34.304 --> 13:35.870
Before the debut of your new line,

13:35.904 --> 13:37.670
Which i'm sure is going to be fabulous.

13:40.438 --> 13:42.703
Sorry.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.504
Hello?

13:44.538 --> 13:46.438
Yes, this is me.

13:46.471 --> 13:48.171
It is too me.

13:48.204 --> 13:50.504
Oh, listen, i'm with brooke right now.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.637
No, i'm not gonna blow it.

13:52.670 --> 13:54.037
No, i am not.

13:54.071 --> 13:55.637
No, i'm not.

13:55.670 --> 13:58.304
Sorry. Sam says hi.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.837
Sam? My sam?

14:01.204 --> 14:03.570
And why does my sam
have your phone number?

14:03.603 --> 14:05.637
She has an interest
in the film industry.

14:05.670 --> 14:08.471
She is 15, you pervert.

14:08.504 --> 14:11.603
Okay, just wrap your
head around it, okay?

14:11.637 --> 14:13.171
You and the movie, i mean.

14:13.204 --> 14:15.637
Not me and sam. She's only 15, you know.

14:15.670 --> 14:17.404
You pervert.

14:27.937 --> 14:29.870
Hey, man, whose shoes are those?

14:29.904 --> 14:32.538
Mine.

14:32.570 --> 14:35.438
I know that, but i'm saying,
who else shoes are they?

14:35.471 --> 14:36.804
Ray allen? Kg?

14:36.837 --> 14:38.837
I heard what you asked.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.371
I meant what i said. They're mine.

14:41.404 --> 14:43.603
Whatever you say, baller.

14:43.637 --> 14:45.271
Kid got his own shoe contract,

14:45.304 --> 14:47.870
But he's still trying
out for the big league.

14:47.904 --> 14:49.371
Don't matter none, anyhow.

14:49.404 --> 14:51.670
Ain't nobody gonna give no roster spot

14:51.703 --> 14:53.937
To no fool with no green elf shoes on.

14:55.670 --> 14:58.438
Hey, man, let me see
those things, riddler.

15:13.703 --> 15:16.204
37 inches.

15:16.237 --> 15:18.104
Get a close enough look?

15:19.737 --> 15:25.237
10, 11, 12, 13,

15:25.271 --> 15:31.037
14, 15, 16, 17...

15:34.603 --> 15:36.404
3.1.

15:42.870 --> 15:44.570
Shame how you've let yourself go, nate.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.870
You were kind of skanky, weren't you?

15:55.904 --> 15:57.737
What? In high school.

15:57.770 --> 15:59.804
You acted all weird this morning

15:59.837 --> 16:02.371
Because you were
totally having sex at 15.

16:02.404 --> 16:03.904
I was not.

16:03.937 --> 16:05.703
You were, too.

16:05.737 --> 16:07.304
Is that where "clothes
over bros" came from?

16:07.337 --> 16:09.538
Tired of being the dirty girl?

16:09.570 --> 16:11.371
'Cause you're a bit of a prude now.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.670
First of all, shut it.

16:13.703 --> 16:16.970
Second of all, if i have
been a little frigid lately...

16:19.171 --> 16:22.703
...it's probably because i...

16:22.737 --> 16:25.703
Was attacked at my store...

16:25.737 --> 16:28.304
Not long before you moved in,

16:28.337 --> 16:31.271
And it's made me a little closed off ...

16:31.304 --> 16:33.071
Especially with boys.

16:33.104 --> 16:35.104
Oh, my god. Brooke, did he ...

16:35.137 --> 16:36.237
No.

16:36.271 --> 16:38.071
No.

16:38.104 --> 16:41.870
But i've been really angry about it,

16:41.904 --> 16:46.804
And i have a whole nother
set of issues with owen.

16:46.837 --> 16:49.271
And i'm...

16:49.304 --> 16:50.504
Trying to let it all go,

16:50.538 --> 16:52.204
And i just wanted you to know.

16:54.171 --> 16:58.870
Because... i just want you to know.

16:58.904 --> 17:00.404
Okay?

17:00.438 --> 17:02.937
Okay.

17:05.237 --> 17:07.837
And, yeah...

17:07.869 --> 17:10.804
For the record, i was
pretty slutty in high school.

17:10.837 --> 17:12.804
And i wish i wouldn't have been,

17:12.837 --> 17:16.770
'Cause you don't get to
take any of that back.

17:16.804 --> 17:18.204
Brooke.

17:21.904 --> 17:25.438
I like talking to you.

17:26.804 --> 17:29.304
Thanks, sam. I like talking to you, too.

17:44.004 --> 17:45.438
Excuse me!

17:48.970 --> 17:50.471
Excuse me!

17:53.538 --> 17:55.171
Hi.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.570
Uh, i'm ...

17:56.603 --> 18:00.171
Lucas scott!

18:00.204 --> 18:02.104
"And in that moment, he realized

18:02.137 --> 18:06.237
"It's not what you are or who you are,

18:06.271 --> 18:10.237
But who they allow you to be."

18:10.271 --> 18:13.337
That is good writing.

18:13.371 --> 18:16.037
Really good writing!

18:22.337 --> 18:23.737
I love this script.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.271
Love it!

18:32.671 --> 18:33.437
I don't want to come out.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.337
Come on, buddy. I want to see you.

18:36.370 --> 18:37.537
No, i look like a tool.

18:37.571 --> 18:39.537
James lucas scott.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.704
You look so awesome!

18:43.737 --> 18:45.404
I look like a penguin.

18:45.437 --> 18:46.804
You look cute!

18:46.837 --> 18:49.871
Now come over here, and we
will go over this song again.

18:51.671 --> 18:53.737
Little tie!

18:53.771 --> 18:55.103
Looks so cute.

18:59.804 --> 19:01.737
Sorry, i always mess that up.

19:01.771 --> 19:03.871
It's okay.

19:03.904 --> 19:04.971
You nervous?

19:05.004 --> 19:06.170
A little.

19:06.203 --> 19:08.103
Yeah, you definitely get that from me.

19:08.137 --> 19:10.904
I wonder how daddy's doing.

19:10.938 --> 19:14.504
I remember now. You
played at maryland, right?

19:14.537 --> 19:17.804
Got into a scrape
right before the draft.

19:17.837 --> 19:19.437
Man, you that fool.

19:19.470 --> 19:21.237
6'5 1/4".

19:21.270 --> 19:22.704
You hear that?

19:22.737 --> 19:24.004
Point guard!

19:24.038 --> 19:25.971
6'5 1/4".

19:26.004 --> 19:28.270
Thank you, god and my mama.

19:29.504 --> 19:34.804
Nathan scott, ladies and gentlemen.

19:34.837 --> 19:37.137
6'2."

19:37.170 --> 19:39.203
Ooh, 6'2" shooting guard.

19:39.237 --> 19:42.837
Are there any scouts out
here for the ymca rec league?

19:42.871 --> 19:44.337
All right, all right.

19:44.370 --> 19:48.437
Gentlemen, we're gonna
divide you up into groups

19:48.470 --> 19:50.004
And let you play.

19:50.038 --> 19:52.370
Point guards on my right.
Two-Guards on my left.

19:52.404 --> 19:54.637
Forwards and centers,
other end of the court.

19:54.671 --> 19:56.137
Show us what you got.

19:58.070 --> 19:59.571
Let's go, fellas.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.237
Nathan.

20:08.637 --> 20:10.237
Two-Guards over here.

20:10.270 --> 20:13.170
I'm trying out as a point guard.

20:13.203 --> 20:15.837
Okay.

20:15.871 --> 20:18.871
But... you ever played the point?

20:20.871 --> 20:22.737
Well, i've never played
point guard in my life.

20:22.771 --> 20:23.938
You better learn,

20:23.971 --> 20:26.337
'Cause you're too short to
play the two in the pros.

20:26.370 --> 20:29.370
Bro, you 6'2".

20:29.404 --> 20:30.837
And i was also 12 hours away

20:30.871 --> 20:32.871
From being an nba
lottery pick, you idiot.

20:32.904 --> 20:34.237
Well, i'm glad you had the accident,

20:34.270 --> 20:35.671
'Cause you sure wouldn't have made it.

20:35.704 --> 20:36.804
You got to move to the point.

20:36.837 --> 20:38.038
You're out of your mind!

20:38.070 --> 20:40.170
You realize nobody's
ever told me this before?

20:40.203 --> 20:42.137
Well, i'm telling you now, all right?

20:42.170 --> 20:43.470
And anyways, man,

20:43.504 --> 20:45.337
They all get their
commission when you sign.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.070
Ain't like nobody gonna risk their 10%

20:47.103 --> 20:48.170
By telling you the truth.

20:48.203 --> 20:49.904
Huh?

20:49.938 --> 20:52.270
Now, look, nate.

20:52.304 --> 20:54.038
Yo, if you can make it

20:54.070 --> 20:58.038
By playing against tall guys
at the two, man, all good.

20:58.070 --> 21:00.504
But if you can't, we
work on your handle,

21:00.537 --> 21:03.337
We work on your quickness,
and we make damn sure

21:03.370 --> 21:05.871
You got the best shot
of playing pro ball.

21:05.904 --> 21:09.237
Why are you doing this for me, q?

21:12.671 --> 21:15.304
This ain't just your dream, man.

21:17.504 --> 21:19.604
Let's work on that left.

21:19.637 --> 21:21.404
Numbers are funny.

21:21.437 --> 21:25.203
They can measure you, time
you, analyze you all they want,

21:25.237 --> 21:27.038
But they all know what really matters

21:27.070 --> 21:29.137
Is how you play the game.

21:29.170 --> 21:31.571
He thinki've lost a step
because of my accident,

21:31.604 --> 21:32.904
So he's gonna play me tight.

21:32.938 --> 21:34.938
I haven't.

21:37.571 --> 21:38.904
Whoo!

21:47.571 --> 21:48.938
Now he'll back off

21:48.971 --> 21:51.137
Because he doesn't want to
get beat off the dribble.

21:51.170 --> 21:54.671
Just a half step.

21:54.704 --> 21:57.604
That's a mistake.

21:59.971 --> 22:01.938
Whoo!

22:01.971 --> 22:04.704
You ever heard the expression
"they can't measure heart"?

22:04.737 --> 22:07.170
Well, the truth is, they
can't measure any of it ...

22:07.203 --> 22:10.671
Heart, want, need.

22:10.704 --> 22:14.304
They think i can't play point guard.

22:14.337 --> 22:16.203
But q knew i could.

22:20.404 --> 22:22.470
You can't measure a dream.

22:25.537 --> 22:27.871
Mouth, you made it.

22:27.904 --> 22:29.470
Here, you better catch up.

22:29.504 --> 22:31.270
You're like the devil. You know that?

22:31.304 --> 22:33.804
No, just devilish.

22:33.837 --> 22:36.137
What's that?

22:36.170 --> 22:38.038
Just a little going-Away present.

22:46.804 --> 22:48.938
Oh, it's the t-Shirt i slept in

22:48.971 --> 22:51.737
After i thew up and
passed out in your bed.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.103
Oh, it's so sweet.

22:55.203 --> 22:58.370
You never told me how you got
me into this t-Shirt, mouth.

22:59.771 --> 23:02.070
Maybe sometime you can get me out of it.

23:11.137 --> 23:13.004
Is this your first script?

23:13.038 --> 23:15.337
Yeah.

23:15.370 --> 23:17.737
Don't worry. I'll fix i

23:17.771 --> 23:20.637
Uh, is there something wrong with it?

23:20.671 --> 23:22.203
No.

23:22.237 --> 23:23.203
I love it.

23:23.237 --> 23:24.871
I said i love it, and i love it.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.737
A couple thoughts, that's all.

23:27.771 --> 23:29.604
Okay, like what?

23:29.637 --> 23:33.237
All right, clear your head, all right?

23:33.270 --> 23:36.038
What if haley...

23:36.070 --> 23:38.504
Dies?

23:42.070 --> 23:43.604
You're serious?

23:43.637 --> 23:45.237
I'm saying think about it.

23:45.270 --> 23:48.537
People love that stuff. Man,
dicaprio died in "titanic."

23:48.571 --> 23:52.737
That is gold, baby, gold!

23:52.771 --> 23:54.370
Yes, but it didn't happen.

23:54.404 --> 23:55.571
It doesn't matter.

23:55.604 --> 23:58.237
Let me ask you this. Who
goes to see this movie?

23:58.270 --> 24:00.537
The same little bitches
who went and saw "titanic."

24:00.571 --> 24:02.203
Young girls, man.

24:02.237 --> 24:04.137
They don't have a voice,

24:04.170 --> 24:07.571
But when they find something
that speaks to them,

24:07.604 --> 24:09.537
We're talking box office, baby!

24:09.571 --> 24:11.038
You're king of the world!

24:11.070 --> 24:12.437
Whew!

24:12.470 --> 24:15.404
Even so,

24:15.437 --> 24:18.370
Haley can't just..Ie.

24:21.637 --> 24:23.103
You got a vision.

24:24.904 --> 24:26.938
I can respect that.

24:34.304 --> 24:36.404
What about this?

24:36.437 --> 24:40.270
What if lucas and haley get married?

24:40.304 --> 24:42.437
I'm serious about this one,

24:42.470 --> 24:44.637
'Cause if there's one thing that i know,

24:44.671 --> 24:47.604
It's that audiences get crazy
over who ends up together.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.437
It's what i do, luke.

24:57.470 --> 24:59.137
It's what i know.

25:01.671 --> 25:03.337
Think about it.

25:03.370 --> 25:05.103
I thought about it.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.504
And i'm not interested.

25:06.537 --> 25:09.103
You couldn't have told
me that over the phone?

25:09.137 --> 25:10.404
Well, that, yeah,

25:10.437 --> 25:12.938
But the rest of this i
wanted to say to your face.

25:12.971 --> 25:14.837
I don't trust you...

25:14.871 --> 25:17.837
Not with peyton, and
definitely not with sam.

25:19.938 --> 25:23.437
And that is not gonna get
you anywhere ...  the grin.

25:23.470 --> 25:26.637
I'm sure it's gotten
you in a lot of doors

25:26.671 --> 25:27.837
And in a lot of beds,

25:27.871 --> 25:30.137
But it's not gonna do
you any good with me.

25:30.170 --> 25:32.337
Listen, brooke, when i make a movie,

25:32.370 --> 25:34.704
I set the bar as high as i possibly can.

25:34.737 --> 25:36.771
I put together my wish-List cast,

25:36.804 --> 25:39.203
My wish-List crew,
my wish-List designer,

25:39.237 --> 25:42.571
And sometimes, you know,
the timing works out,

25:42.604 --> 25:45.737
The material works
out, and you get lucky.

25:48.837 --> 25:51.604
Sometimes you don't.

25:51.637 --> 25:54.237
Good luck with everything.

26:21.103 --> 26:22.871
I didn't listen to it.

26:24.804 --> 26:26.103
I write my own songs.

26:26.137 --> 26:28.704
Mia, i am not in the
best mood right now,

26:28.737 --> 26:30.637
And so it is a very bad time

26:30.671 --> 26:33.170
For you to make some naive little stand.

26:33.203 --> 26:34.671
You think i'm naive?

26:34.704 --> 26:36.604
Peyton, i am not the same girl

26:36.637 --> 26:38.704
Who left on tour last year, okay?

26:38.737 --> 26:41.904
God, i hope that's not true,
because i liked that girl.

26:41.938 --> 26:44.038
As a matter of fact, i loved that girl.

26:44.070 --> 26:46.604
Oh, really? Then what
happened to protecting her?

26:46.637 --> 26:49.004
What happened to telling
the label to be patient,

26:49.038 --> 26:50.837
Because my songs are gonna be great?

26:50.871 --> 26:52.437
Oh, i've been doing that!

26:52.470 --> 26:54.837
I have been doing that for months now!

26:54.871 --> 26:57.938
But what happened to
actually doing the work, mia?

26:57.971 --> 27:00.771
Now, the label wants
you to record this song

27:00.804 --> 27:02.103
Because they care.

27:02.137 --> 27:05.304
When they stop caring,
that's when we have a problem.

27:05.337 --> 27:07.470
Well, i'm not gonna do it.

27:07.504 --> 27:09.971
You are being so ungrateful!
Do you understand?

27:10.004 --> 27:13.637
I put my ass on the line
for you every single day!

27:13.671 --> 27:15.971
Well, i put my ass on the line for you

27:16.004 --> 27:17.771
Every single night, peyton.

27:17.804 --> 27:18.904
Okay? Literally.

27:18.938 --> 27:20.971
Did you see how short that skirt was

27:21.004 --> 27:23.137
That you put me in at the u.S.O. Show?

27:23.170 --> 27:24.203
But i did it.

27:24.237 --> 27:27.004
I've done everything
you've asked me to do,

27:27.038 --> 27:28.771
But i am not gonna do this.

27:28.804 --> 27:30.004
Hey.

27:36.337 --> 27:38.938
I'm not sure you should
be on this label anymore.

27:40.837 --> 27:43.370
Life's too short.

27:43.404 --> 27:45.571
Trust me.

28:25.070 --> 28:28.070
Man, madison's really killing it.

28:28.103 --> 28:29.771
I knew i should've told jokes.

28:29.804 --> 28:33.004
Seriously. You're hosed.

28:39.203 --> 28:41.004
Hi. Hey!

28:43.170 --> 28:44.604
You smell like alcohol.

28:44.637 --> 28:45.671
Really? Yeah.

28:45.704 --> 28:47.671
Is it bad? No.

28:47.704 --> 28:48.804
Do you have any with you?

28:48.837 --> 28:50.871
No.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.737
Hey! Look who we found!

29:00.771 --> 29:01.837
Hey!

29:01.871 --> 29:04.637
Hi, mouth. Hey, baby.

29:04.671 --> 29:05.938
How did it go?

29:05.971 --> 29:10.337
I did what my son told me
to ...  the best i could.

29:20.404 --> 29:21.771
Here he comes!

29:21.804 --> 29:23.370
He looks so cute!

29:23.404 --> 29:24.637
He's nervous.

29:27.370 --> 29:30.237
Hi, my name is james lucas scott,

29:30.270 --> 29:34.070
And i'm gonna play "the first noel."

29:34.103 --> 29:35.704
He's just got to get
past this first part,

29:35.737 --> 29:37.170
And he'll be good.

29:54.203 --> 29:56.170
Oh, no.

29:57.871 --> 29:59.671
This is awkward.

30:09.270 --> 30:12.270
How's everyone doing tonight?

30:22.203 --> 30:25.704
Last week, my mom asked me
how i liked going to school.

30:25.737 --> 30:30.337
I told her, "not as much as
i like coming home from it."

30:38.137 --> 30:41.704
And seriously, what's
with the cafeteria food?

30:41.737 --> 30:46.404
I mean, i can't tell if kids are
out sick from eating that stuff,

30:46.437 --> 30:49.437
Or we're actually eating
the kids who are out sick.

30:51.504 --> 30:55.203
Take my hot lunch...please.

30:57.771 --> 31:02.103
And now, the big finish.

31:12.004 --> 31:13.337
Something like that.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.537
What do you want from me? I'm 5.

31:15.571 --> 31:17.938
Thank you and good night!

31:38.971 --> 31:42.270
Should've gone to jamie's
talent show with brooke.

31:42.304 --> 31:43.704
You're kidding, right?

31:43.737 --> 31:44.804
I like them.

31:44.837 --> 31:46.370
They're nice to me.

31:46.404 --> 31:48.671
I think it's funny how
you stole from brooke davis

31:48.704 --> 31:50.004
And called her a bitch,

31:50.038 --> 31:51.470
And now you like her.

31:51.504 --> 31:53.504
I was pissed off. So what?

31:53.537 --> 31:56.337
What'd you say after she
caught you shoplifting?

31:56.370 --> 31:58.203
You said she was a rich bitch

31:58.237 --> 31:59.971
And someone should put her in her place.

32:00.004 --> 32:01.437
So?

32:04.470 --> 32:07.203
You said someone should
put her in her place, sam.

32:10.304 --> 32:15.237
So, tell me again why lucas
has to end up with peyton.

32:15.270 --> 32:17.203
Because they do.

32:17.237 --> 32:20.671
Because that's the story.
Because that's what happened.

32:20.704 --> 32:22.404
It's a movie!

32:22.437 --> 32:24.804
Got to raise the stakes.

32:24.837 --> 32:28.804
Kill off one of the younger characters.

32:30.871 --> 32:32.771
Hello?

32:32.804 --> 32:36.038
Hi, doctor. It's me.

32:36.070 --> 32:39.337
Well, what does that mean?

32:39.370 --> 32:41.304
What's wrong?

32:44.137 --> 32:47.038
After you caught me shoplifting,

32:47.103 --> 32:49.771
I was with my friends,

32:49.804 --> 32:52.504
And i said some terrible
things about you.

32:52.537 --> 32:54.771
Okay.

32:54.804 --> 32:56.537
Sam, what happened?

32:58.370 --> 33:01.938
Well ...  don't, please. Just don't.

33:01.971 --> 33:04.170
But i didn't mean them.

33:04.203 --> 33:06.437
I didn't ...  i didn't mean any of it.

33:09.571 --> 33:10.837
But...

33:10.871 --> 33:13.237
Sam, i'm sorry. I don't understand.

33:36.904 --> 33:38.237
The attack...

33:40.804 --> 33:42.637
...it was my fault.

34:00.404 --> 34:03.570
Bourbon is a good,
honest drink, you know?

34:03.604 --> 34:05.038
Classier than whiskey.

34:05.071 --> 34:07.671
Less of a stick up its ass than scotch.

34:10.871 --> 34:13.704
I'm an alcoholic.

34:13.737 --> 34:15.570
Owen...

34:15.603 --> 34:17.237
Has sam been in here tonight?

34:17.270 --> 34:18.570
No. Why? What's wrong?

34:18.603 --> 34:20.138
We had a ...  a thing

34:20.170 --> 34:24.004
And she left and i let her
go and i shouldn't have.

34:24.038 --> 34:26.038
It's okay. Here, have a seat.

34:26.071 --> 34:27.437
No, i have to find her.

34:27.469 --> 34:29.570
Brooke, come on, she's a teenager.

34:29.603 --> 34:31.737
She's not even your teenager.

34:31.771 --> 34:34.437
And what is that supposed to mean?

34:34.469 --> 34:37.237
I'll let you two...

34:37.270 --> 34:38.937
Julian, if she calls you ...

34:38.971 --> 34:41.138
It's not my problem.

34:44.237 --> 34:47.536
Look...i just mean

34:47.570 --> 34:50.237
It's not like she's gonna
stay with you forever, right?

34:50.270 --> 34:52.138
What is wrong with you?

34:52.170 --> 34:55.138
I came here because i need your help.

34:55.170 --> 34:58.138
But, i mean, you know
sam. She'll turn up.

34:58.170 --> 34:59.570
No

34:59.604 --> 35:02.303
It's different this time.

35:02.337 --> 35:05.437
But with you, it's exactly the same.

35:05.470 --> 35:06.671
Hey, brooke!

35:10.004 --> 35:11.804
That's not fair.

35:11.837 --> 35:15.170
I have to find her!

35:15.203 --> 35:18.871
But i'll do it by myself,
just like i always do.

35:18.904 --> 35:20.570
Don't call me anymore.

35:29.104 --> 35:31.604
So, how about we rent a
movie, and then we can ...

35:35.637 --> 35:38.837
I was looking for the
number for the pizza place.

35:38.871 --> 35:40.837
Oh, no. No, no, millie, it's not ...

35:40.871 --> 35:42.504
It's not what it looks like?

35:42.537 --> 35:44.704
This isn't a half-Naked
picture of your ex-Girlfriend

35:44.737 --> 35:46.237
In one of your t-Shirts?

35:46.270 --> 35:48.837
She sent it to me
tonight. It was a joke.

35:48.871 --> 35:50.071
Millie, please.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.170
There is nothing going
on between us, i swear.

35:52.203 --> 35:53.437
I-I was gonna delete it.

35:53.470 --> 35:54.570
But you didn't.

35:57.138 --> 35:59.570
You know what?

35:59.604 --> 36:02.303
You're an idiot.

36:02.337 --> 36:05.504
Millie, don't go, please.

36:05.537 --> 36:07.071
It doesn't mean anything.

36:07.104 --> 36:10.203
You're wrong, marvin.

36:10.237 --> 36:12.038
It means everything.

36:19.504 --> 36:23.270
How funny was your son tonight?

36:24.837 --> 36:27.237
Oh, he was goofy, like his mom.

36:27.270 --> 36:29.971
I think he was brave, like his dad.

36:32.038 --> 36:34.370
Mmm.

36:34.404 --> 36:37.871
So, what's next with our comeback?

36:37.904 --> 36:40.937
Well, what's next is
the phone's gonna ring,

36:40.971 --> 36:44.170
And the answer is either
gonna be a yes or a no.

36:44.203 --> 36:47.203
It's going to be a yes.

36:47.237 --> 36:49.071
I hope so.

36:49.104 --> 36:52.804
But if it's a no, then
this is the end of it,

36:52.837 --> 36:54.671
And i'm okay with that.

37:28.804 --> 37:32.303
Rough night, millie?

37:32.337 --> 37:35.038
Horrible.

37:38.004 --> 37:39.203
Yeah, me, too.

37:50.437 --> 37:52.804
You know i haven't had a
drink in over eight years?

37:55.837 --> 37:58.971
Tonight, that's gonna change.

38:01.270 --> 38:04.138
I haven't had sex in over 22 years.

38:05.937 --> 38:09.071
And tonight, that's gonna change.

38:13.170 --> 38:14.170
Thank you.

38:14.203 --> 38:15.303
Hey.

38:15.337 --> 38:16.604
Hey, any luck?

38:16.637 --> 38:19.303
Uh, no. Are you looking for her, too?

38:19.337 --> 38:21.104
I'm not that guy, brooke.

38:21.138 --> 38:23.504
I'm just getting coffee. Sorry.

38:25.637 --> 38:26.937
Excuse me.

38:26.971 --> 38:28.038
I'm looking for someone ...

38:28.071 --> 38:29.671
A young girl that comes in here a lot.

38:29.704 --> 38:33.170
She's kind of a skater, sarcastic.

38:33.203 --> 38:35.004
Let me guess.

38:35.038 --> 38:36.104
Her name is sam,

38:36.138 --> 38:38.470
And she puts a lot of
sugar in her coffee.

38:38.504 --> 38:39.604
You've seen her?

38:39.637 --> 38:42.071
No, but that cute guy that just left

38:42.104 --> 38:44.203
Asked me the same exact thing.

38:44.237 --> 38:46.971
Thanks.

39:00.837 --> 39:02.203
And then he got worried,

39:02.237 --> 39:04.270
And he backed off just a half step.

39:04.303 --> 39:06.071
So, what do you think i did?

39:06.104 --> 39:08.203
Pulled up for 3 ...  nothing but net.

39:08.237 --> 39:09.804
That's right.

39:09.837 --> 39:11.537
You know, i'm proud of you, buddy.

39:11.570 --> 39:14.004
You took something that
would've beaten most people,

39:14.038 --> 39:15.303
And you kept going with it.

39:15.337 --> 39:17.404
You turned it into something great.

39:17.437 --> 39:19.637
So did you, daddy.

39:21.071 --> 39:24.504
All right, chris rock, i
know you're still wired,

39:24.537 --> 39:26.104
But it's time for bed.

39:26.138 --> 39:28.138
How about a nursery rhyme?

39:28.170 --> 39:30.370
Okay.

39:30.404 --> 39:31.804
But you're gonna have to read it.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.270
You want an old-School, creepy one,

39:33.303 --> 39:34.504
Or a new,
good-For-You one?

39:34.537 --> 39:36.337
Old-School creepy. Okay.

39:38.804 --> 39:40.370
Okay.

39:43.270 --> 39:44.570
There.

39:44.604 --> 39:46.203
Gentle.

39:46.237 --> 39:49.104
"A man of words and not of deeds

39:49.138 --> 39:51.671
Is like a garden full of weeds."

39:53.303 --> 39:58.004
"And when the weeds begin to grow,

39:58.038 --> 40:00.671
It's like a garden full of snow."

40:02.404 --> 40:04.971
"And when the snow begins to fall,

40:05.004 --> 40:06.937
It's like a bird upon the wall."

40:13.671 --> 40:16.904
"And when the bird away does fly,

40:16.937 --> 40:20.071
It's like an eagle in the sky."

40:20.104 --> 40:23.071
You bring out...

40:23.104 --> 40:25.671
"And when the y begins to roar,

40:25.704 --> 40:27.904
It's like a lion at the door."

40:27.937 --> 40:30.038
Hi.

40:30.071 --> 40:32.303
I have to tell you something.

40:41.237 --> 40:44.537
