WEBVTT

00:48.591 --> 00:56.682
THE DEAL

01:10.237 --> 01:15.451
Honey... I need your help...

01:18.287 --> 01:23.501
Honey. Help me, please.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.463
Help me, please.

01:27.505 --> 01:31.467
No. Baby! Baby.

01:31.509 --> 01:33.469
It's okay. It's okay.

01:33.511 --> 01:34.970
Here, I'll take you to a hospital.

01:35.012 --> 01:37.515
It's okay. Here.

01:38.224 --> 01:40.017
Come on, baby. There. Get in.

01:41.769 --> 01:44.522
I'm here, baby. It's okay.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.552
It's my fault. It's all my fault.

02:16.262 --> 02:18.556
It's okay. Look, it's the police.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.015
Don't worry,

02:20.057 --> 02:23.018
everything's gonna be okay.
Officer!

02:27.064 --> 02:31.026
So, you're saying
it was a break-in?

02:31.068 --> 02:32.319
Yes, right.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.322
Can I go with her, please?

02:35.364 --> 02:38.075
Sure, after a few more questions.

02:38.576 --> 02:40.744
You said they broke in
in the afternoon.

02:40.786 --> 02:43.330
Yes. No. First, a girl came by.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.000
Curly blond hair,
she was wearing a jacket,

02:46.041 --> 02:48.043
and said that she was
in a car accident,

02:48.085 --> 02:49.044
and that there was no signal.

02:49.086 --> 02:51.630
There was signal at our house,
so she came in, ate something,

02:51.672 --> 02:53.257
and we waited for her mother
to pick her up.

02:53.591 --> 02:54.550
Her mother.

02:54.592 --> 02:56.552
Yes, at least that's what she said.

02:56.594 --> 02:59.096
But one thing led to another--

03:01.098 --> 03:04.351
I'm sorry, what do you mean
one thing lead to another?

03:08.105 --> 03:10.566
Can I go with my wife now?

03:10.608 --> 03:13.652
Yo! The car's documents.

03:13.694 --> 03:14.862
Last name?

03:14.904 --> 03:16.572
Riscal. Mr. Riscal.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.573
Riscal.

03:17.615 --> 03:19.116
-Where are you taking her?
-Don't worry.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.576
She will be okay.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.244
She's okay. She's stable.

03:22.286 --> 03:23.579
We will keep you informed,

03:23.621 --> 03:27.082
but you need to come
to the police station.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.083
Who? Me?

03:28.125 --> 03:29.627
Please.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.087
Please.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.633
Come with us.

03:44.475 --> 03:46.101
24 HOURS EARLIER

03:46.143 --> 03:48.646
No, I want her out.

03:49.647 --> 03:51.106
She can't have a say.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.108
Okay, anything else?

03:53.150 --> 03:55.277
I want to be the majority shareholder.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.155
I want full control over the Board.

03:58.656 --> 04:00.115
And most importantly,

04:00.157 --> 04:02.117
I want her to be forced to attend

04:02.159 --> 04:03.619
whenever I call her.

04:03.661 --> 04:06.080
I want her to look me in the eye
when I have something to say.

04:06.455 --> 04:07.581
That's going to be challenging.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.124
I don't give a fuck.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.335
You're my lawyer
and these are my terms.

04:11.377 --> 04:13.087
If that's what you want--

04:13.128 --> 04:15.297
Can she decline?

04:15.339 --> 04:19.468
Borja, you two spent a decade
building the company.

04:19.510 --> 04:21.637
She should have considered
that before... Fuck it.

04:21.679 --> 04:23.555
Borja, listen. Cat is very smart.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.849
Since she came to the firm
with her father

04:25.891 --> 04:27.643
and stayed with us in the office,

04:27.685 --> 04:29.061
she never said a word,

04:29.103 --> 04:31.146
but I'm sure she perfectly understood

04:31.188 --> 04:34.650
every time we talked about
mergers and acquisitions.

04:34.692 --> 04:36.777
Her father never hid
anything from her.

04:36.819 --> 04:39.154
On the contrary,
he wanted her to be prepared

04:39.196 --> 04:40.656
for the future.

04:40.698 --> 04:41.657
I know.

04:43.701 --> 04:46.328
So while I review these bylaws,

04:46.370 --> 04:49.123
you try to work it out calmly.

04:49.707 --> 04:53.168
Dammit. Seven years thrown away.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.379
We will use that in our lawsuit.

04:55.421 --> 04:59.425
Look, if she declines our offer,
we will file for divorce.

04:59.466 --> 05:03.554
We will allege breach of trust
and betrayal of vows,

05:04.221 --> 05:06.181
saying that it all occurred
behind your back

05:06.223 --> 05:10.394
while you worked relentlessly
trying to establish the company.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.354
There's no way a judge
won't find an aggravating factor

05:12.396 --> 05:16.233
when the relationship between you
is also proven.

05:17.484 --> 05:21.697
We will threaten her with damaging
her reputation on social media

05:21.739 --> 05:22.948
and everywhere else.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.199
Will it work?

05:24.241 --> 05:26.744
Of course. I'm sure it will.

05:27.244 --> 05:30.205
I'm only worried about
the eighth clause of the deal.

05:30.247 --> 05:33.709
It could backfire in trial, Borja.

05:33.751 --> 05:36.712
It's unusual. It's... excessive.

05:36.754 --> 05:39.214
We need something big

05:39.256 --> 05:42.426
to make sense of your state of mind.

05:42.468 --> 05:44.511
So, do you have any proof
or something?

05:45.262 --> 05:47.264
Sure. Hold on.

05:48.766 --> 05:52.770
I will send you some pictures.
Don't hang up.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.780
They're on their way.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.950
Yes, I see them.

06:06.992 --> 06:09.244
Oh, shit.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.455
You full-on caught her, man.

06:11.789 --> 06:14.291
One more thing,
thank you for choosing me.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.252
No. No, it's nothing.

06:17.294 --> 06:21.799
Listen to me...
don't lose your head, alright?

06:22.049 --> 06:24.760
Don't get swept up by your emotions
and end up doing something

06:24.802 --> 06:26.929
you might regret
for the rest of your life.

06:26.970 --> 06:30.265
No, I won't. I will call you
when everything is over.

06:30.307 --> 06:33.310
Fine. Bye, man.

06:43.821 --> 06:45.322
Do you know who she is?

06:51.537 --> 06:55.124
Yes. She's my wife.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.793
With someone I know.

06:57.835 --> 07:00.295
We found these in your house,
along with--

07:00.337 --> 07:02.589
-So?
-Let me finish.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.842
Right. I'm sorry.

07:05.342 --> 07:07.636
Did you file for divorce?

07:09.054 --> 07:12.307
These pictures made you
take action?

07:12.349 --> 07:14.309
I sent them to my lawyer
for advice.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.312
Answer the question.

07:17.354 --> 07:19.815
Not without my lawyer.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.651
Tell me what happened last night.

07:23.861 --> 07:26.822
Well--

07:26.864 --> 07:28.824
Hey there.

07:28.866 --> 07:30.325
What's up, man?

07:30.367 --> 07:31.326
You're on your way, right?

07:31.368 --> 07:34.371
Yeah, I just made a stop.
Do you need anything?

07:34.830 --> 07:37.624
Not at all.
There's plenty of everything.

07:39.668 --> 07:41.336
Are you okay?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.548
Yes, of course. Why?

07:44.590 --> 07:46.049
I don't know.
It's your anniversary, right?

07:46.091 --> 07:47.843
I have nothing to do with it.

07:47.885 --> 07:50.345
You're my best pal, aren't you?

07:50.387 --> 07:53.348
I mean... this should be
between you two.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.850
She's on a trip.

07:54.892 --> 07:56.351
On your anniversary?

07:56.393 --> 07:59.354
Yes. You know, duty calls.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.315
-So, what did you get her?
-What?

08:01.356 --> 08:03.859
For a present,
what did you get her?

08:03.901 --> 08:06.862
Honestly, I didn't find
anything she would like.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.865
But maybe you can help me
to find her something.

08:09.907 --> 08:14.578
You know her almost
as well as I do. Huh?

08:14.620 --> 08:15.412
Sure.

08:16.246 --> 08:19.374
We will find something.
Don't you worry.

08:19.875 --> 08:22.377
Okay. One more thing.

08:22.419 --> 08:24.838
I'm glad you're coming this weekend.

08:25.380 --> 08:28.383
We'll have a good time.
I needed a weekend with friends.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.676
You know.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.720
In the end, it's always
only you and me.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.556
I'm on my way.

08:34.598 --> 08:36.892
Good, drive safely.

09:02.459 --> 09:03.418
You're here.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.420
Sure, where else would I be?

09:05.462 --> 09:06.964
Come here.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.135
Oh! You cooked.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.471
I did. Smell.

09:16.473 --> 09:19.476
Look at this.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.438
Tasty, right?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.482
It's been a while since
you last cooked for me.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.944
Can I take a shower before dinner?

09:29.194 --> 09:31.989
Of course. Today's your day.

09:32.489 --> 09:36.994
It's so good. Delicious.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.963
Margaux '59.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.466
Weren't we keeping it
for a special occasion?

09:51.508 --> 09:53.969
We're always keeping things
for special occasions.

09:54.011 --> 09:58.015
What better occasion than
celebrating our marriage?

09:59.683 --> 10:06.148
Here. Also, you said you wanted
to explore the limits, right?

10:06.189 --> 10:10.527
-Me?
-Yes. You.

10:17.534 --> 10:21.538
To us. To you.

10:35.052 --> 10:37.054
Let me taste it.

11:38.115 --> 11:40.117
The doorbell.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.129
Are you expecting anyone?

11:52.921 --> 11:58.135
Could it be flowers
or an anniversary gift?

11:58.635 --> 11:59.553
What are you doing here?

11:59.594 --> 12:02.639
-Weren't you on a trip?
-A trip?

12:07.144 --> 12:09.271
Marcos, it's nice to see you.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.606
What a surprise, come in.
Come in.

12:11.648 --> 12:17.112
-Honey!
-Marcos, you're here!

12:17.154 --> 12:18.113
Please, come in.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.115
Cat was about to take a shower.

12:20.157 --> 12:21.116
Dinner is ready.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.660
I opened a wonderful wine.
You will like it.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.163
Terrific.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.623
Help yourself. I'm coming.

12:28.665 --> 12:32.127
Can you explain me
why you invited Marcos?

12:32.169 --> 12:35.088
Well, I told you today
I was feeling spontaneous.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.381
And you said you liked that.

12:37.174 --> 12:41.178
Relax, we will have fun.
You'll see.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.358
Dear Lord, you're a great cook, bud.

12:55.400 --> 12:56.985
Fuck.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.655
I think I overate.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.450
I'm glad. Bud.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.661
Actually, you've always
been a great cook.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.206
I still don't know what the hell
I'm doing here, but--

13:09.498 --> 13:12.209
After this, I won't complain, right?

13:13.210 --> 13:14.669
To us, guys.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.213
We're glad you're here.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.381
Yes. That's true.

13:18.423 --> 13:25.222
To my best, best, best,
best friend.

13:30.519 --> 13:34.231
Seven years later, here we are.
The three of us.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.234
It seems like it was yesterday,
the biggest drinking night ever.

13:38.235 --> 13:41.738
And here we are. The three of us.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.203
It was a lovely wedding.

13:48.870 --> 13:52.207
I almost forgot.
There's one more thing.

13:52.249 --> 13:54.209
I can't eat anything else.
Or I might throw up.

13:54.251 --> 13:56.253
Trust me, you will love this.

13:59.756 --> 14:01.758
Please, find a way to leave, okay?

14:02.008 --> 14:04.219
I don't know what's going on,
but this is awkward,

14:04.261 --> 14:07.264
so find an excuse to leave.

14:09.891 --> 14:13.853
Let's see what the chef prepared.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.730
Voilà!

14:15.772 --> 14:18.233
-What's this?
-Dessert.

14:18.275 --> 14:22.237
This is for you.
And this one is yours.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.281
Enjoy, pal.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.749
Non-disclosure agreement.
What is it for?

14:34.791 --> 14:37.377
Are you creating a new company or--

14:40.213 --> 14:42.257
This motherfucker is funny.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.259
Always thinking of business, huh?

14:44.301 --> 14:46.303
I don't understand
what the fuck is this.

14:46.595 --> 14:51.808
It's something special.
To my most special persons.

14:52.309 --> 14:56.271
No, it's not that. This has
nothing to do with business.

14:56.313 --> 14:57.772
This is about us.

14:58.023 --> 15:01.276
It is. But it's not.

15:01.318 --> 15:02.819
But it is.

15:03.528 --> 15:07.282
It's about you. About all of us.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.284
And our business.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.084
Well, I better get going, or--

15:18.126 --> 15:21.296
-It's too late for that, you moron.
-Is it?

15:21.338 --> 15:23.298
This is between you two,
I'm leaving.

15:23.340 --> 15:28.345
This actually concerns you.

15:28.845 --> 15:30.513
Stop pretending, I know it all.

15:30.555 --> 15:33.266
I've seen your photographs,
everything.

15:33.850 --> 15:35.310
How can you be so cynical?

15:35.352 --> 15:36.853
Are you losing it or what?

15:37.103 --> 15:39.814
-Cynical me?
-Yes, you.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.817
What's this? The divorce papers?

15:42.859 --> 15:45.987
No. No, no, it's--

15:46.029 --> 15:48.823
It's a deal, he wants to buy me out.

15:48.865 --> 15:50.367
What?

15:50.867 --> 15:53.662
Let's call it a practical divorce.

15:54.079 --> 15:55.288
As set forth herein,

15:55.330 --> 15:58.333
I'll gain control
of your shares and the company.

15:58.375 --> 16:02.962
And listen, I'm paying you
enough money so you can do

16:03.004 --> 16:04.839
whatever you want,
wherever you want to do it.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.342
That way, I can leave you behind,
and keep my company.

16:07.384 --> 16:10.303
Down here, on Earth,
I will do that.

16:10.345 --> 16:12.347
A campaign to rename the brand.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.848
You will fade out gradually.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.809
No complications, no drama,
nothing.

16:15.850 --> 16:18.645
You two can stop hiding like rats.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.356
And I can continue working
on the company I built.

16:21.398 --> 16:22.857
That we both built.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.193
Look, you lost
the right to say that

16:25.235 --> 16:26.861
the moment you started
fucking with my best pal.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.614
One thing has nothing to do
with the other.

16:30.156 --> 16:32.033
You're playing the victim now?

16:32.075 --> 16:35.370
I'm the victim here. Understood?

16:35.412 --> 16:37.831
And let me tell you this,
be smart.

16:37.872 --> 16:40.375
Any other man,
under these circumstances,

16:40.417 --> 16:43.378
wouldn't even give you
half the money I'm offering.

16:43.420 --> 16:45.839
-Don't play the fucking victim.
-Take it easy, okay?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.382
-Shut up.
-I can't speak?

16:47.424 --> 16:50.176
Then what the fuck am I doing here?
Huh? Tell me.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.439
I want you two to look me in the eye.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.609
After all of this, after so long,

17:06.651 --> 17:09.070
and so much bullshit and lies,

17:09.112 --> 17:11.698
I'm trying to be the bigger man.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.159
Okay. I'll get going, or--

17:14.200 --> 17:15.410
Are you leaving her alone?

17:15.452 --> 17:17.537
You fucked her all this time,
and now you're leaving her?

17:18.955 --> 17:21.958
I'm freaking out
about all of this too!

17:31.468 --> 17:34.971
Was there someone else
when all of this happened?

17:35.680 --> 17:38.433
Um... yes. Marcos, a friend.

17:38.475 --> 17:40.477
Marcos, right.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.647
Mr. Riscal, you better cooperate
and don't lie to me.

17:45.482 --> 17:47.942
Listen, lady.
I'm telling the truth.

17:47.984 --> 17:51.154
Your house was intact.
There were no sings of a break-in.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.656
We only found
your wife's suitcase.

17:56.159 --> 17:57.118
What about Marcos?

17:57.494 --> 17:58.995
What do you want me to tell you?

17:59.245 --> 18:02.999
-I did wrong.
-So wrong.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.002
Look...

18:10.006 --> 18:12.717
For some reason, at some point

18:12.759 --> 18:16.471
in life you forgot about me,
you replaced me.

18:16.513 --> 18:19.015
Do you realize that much?

18:20.517 --> 18:23.478
Maybe you didn't notice,
but all the energy that we had,

18:23.520 --> 18:26.731
all the energy between us,
you poured it all on our company.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.693
You and I became nothing
but a business.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.779
And you forgot about me.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.534
You're a man of success.
You don't like failure.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.037
That's why I never thought
this would happen.

18:41.538 --> 18:45.041
I thought we could survive
this, do you hear me?

18:45.834 --> 18:48.461
All of a sudden, those trips started.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.505
What first were getaway trips,

18:50.547 --> 18:52.674
suddenly became business trips.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.551
Longer and longer and longer trips,

18:54.801 --> 18:56.010
and we were so fucked up.

18:56.052 --> 18:59.013
As fucked up as everybody else.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.516
We became the common denominator.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.018
All the lies and the betrayal,
and that sort of things,

19:04.060 --> 19:07.522
and this fucking house where
I thought we would finally be alone,

19:07.564 --> 19:11.025
just you and me,
and get back what we had,

19:11.067 --> 19:15.071
but it turned out that I
was left all alone. Do you realize?

19:20.577 --> 19:25.081
You're good, huh? No. I don't know
why but I don't believe you.

19:25.582 --> 19:30.086
Oh. Right. Wait. Look at this.

19:34.090 --> 19:36.593
No, no, wait. Look.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.096
Okay, stop it now.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.562
You will sign the papers, right?

19:47.604 --> 19:51.107
Is that what you want?
Will that really make you happy?

19:51.858 --> 19:54.068
I don't know what the fuck
is going to make me happy now.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.529
But you leave me no choice.

19:56.571 --> 19:58.114
Okay.

20:00.617 --> 20:02.118
Are you sure?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.130
Let's see.

20:21.304 --> 20:23.139
I'm really sorry. Forgive me.

20:23.389 --> 20:26.559
Well, I don't give a fuck now.

20:26.601 --> 20:30.104
Make sure your boyfriend
signs the NDA

20:30.146 --> 20:33.107
and we'll be done
with the negotiation.

20:33.149 --> 20:34.609
You can take care of that.

20:34.651 --> 20:36.611
You can tell him and say goodbye,

20:36.653 --> 20:39.113
because I will keep seeing him.

20:40.657 --> 20:43.451
I think you misread this.

20:46.371 --> 20:49.165
The deal is invalid
if he doesn't sign.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.168
So you better go and try
to convince him.

20:53.378 --> 20:55.838
It won't be that difficult, huh?

20:55.880 --> 20:57.674
One more thing.

20:57.924 --> 21:01.135
Our lawyer...
isn't ours anymore.

21:01.177 --> 21:03.179
He's my lawyer.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.935
You know for who I'm really sorry?

21:08.977 --> 21:12.146
Not me, I'm better than ever.

21:12.188 --> 21:16.109
And I don't deserve that you say
for that bastard out there.

21:16.150 --> 21:21.197
No. For me.
I'm sorry for me.

21:21.489 --> 21:23.157
For both of us, actually.

21:23.199 --> 21:26.703
Because... we lost everything
we were.

21:27.704 --> 21:29.664
We got lost in this shit.

21:29.706 --> 21:30.873
And yes, I got swept up.

21:32.750 --> 21:34.669
You're really good.

21:34.711 --> 21:36.713
Did you notice just now?

21:37.213 --> 21:40.174
Hey, did you read
the last clause of the deal?

21:40.216 --> 21:42.218
Take a look.

21:45.888 --> 21:48.224
Son of a bitch!

22:01.738 --> 22:05.408
Hey girl.
Got available lots.

22:05.450 --> 22:07.118
Do you want me to park it for you?

22:08.745 --> 22:09.454
Is that the rate?

22:09.495 --> 22:11.497
PUBLIC PARKING

22:11.748 --> 22:14.709
For a beautiful woman like you,
it's free.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.754
Oh, I see. That's cute.

22:19.881 --> 22:21.424
Where are you from?

22:21.466 --> 22:25.678
It's been a tough day, darling,
I'm not in the mood for this bullshit.

22:25.720 --> 22:28.264
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

22:28.765 --> 22:31.893
You're short-tempered, huh?
I see you.

22:31.934 --> 22:34.771
Are you from Cuba?

22:37.774 --> 22:40.234
I'm from wherever I want.

22:42.278 --> 22:44.238
Should I call the cops or what?

22:44.280 --> 22:47.283
That accent is turning me on,
to be honest.

22:53.289 --> 22:57.752
Why don't you just... let me?

22:57.794 --> 22:59.796
Let you what?

23:03.925 --> 23:05.426
You shitface!

23:05.468 --> 23:07.303
How dare you
do something like that?

23:07.595 --> 23:09.764
You know I trusted you.

23:09.806 --> 23:10.765
How much is he paying you?

23:10.807 --> 23:12.767
Look, Cat, first
you need to calm down.

23:12.809 --> 23:16.270
Shut up! You know I can
sue you for this, right?

23:16.312 --> 23:18.481
You have to understand,
I'm only doing my job.

23:18.523 --> 23:20.525
You know I'm very patient

23:20.566 --> 23:22.777
to fuck someone's life
and I can sue you for this?

23:22.819 --> 23:26.030
Right now, I'm stuck in the middle
of the separation of two persons

23:26.072 --> 23:29.283
I'm truly and personally fond of.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.786
I need you to understand
where I'm standing, that's all.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.788
My father thought of you
as a friend.

23:33.830 --> 23:36.249
I wish he was alive
to see you as the snake you are.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.305
Here.

23:55.560 --> 23:57.645
So, what were you thinking?

23:59.522 --> 24:01.816
I mean, what's the logic

24:01.858 --> 24:04.360
behind ending up fucking
my wife?

24:05.611 --> 24:08.322
Did you forget
who brought you to Mexico?

24:08.364 --> 24:11.868
Who paid for your house?
Who gave you everything?

24:12.160 --> 24:14.370
How long have we known each other?
Is it ten years now?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.831
Look at me.
Look at me, motherfucker.

24:17.832 --> 24:19.876
Do you like her that much?

24:22.545 --> 24:23.838
Dear Lord.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.883
I've been laughing at you
for weeks.

24:42.398 --> 24:44.358
Well, these things happen

24:44.400 --> 24:46.027
when you try to have
an open relationship, right?

24:46.068 --> 24:47.862
It's my turn.

24:47.904 --> 24:50.364
So, I trust my wife,
I have an open relationship,

24:50.406 --> 24:52.867
-and then you fuck her?
-Will you let me talk or what?

24:52.909 --> 24:53.868
Not if you're going to lie.

24:53.910 --> 24:55.870
I'm trying to explain it to you, dude.

24:55.912 --> 24:57.872
Are you aware that you've been
lying to me for years?

24:57.914 --> 24:59.916
That's it. Enough.

25:32.240 --> 25:35.701
I told you I want to understand you.
Marcos, I'm serious.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.703
I want to understand
what's on your mind

25:37.745 --> 25:39.914
to want to fuck my wife.

25:39.956 --> 25:43.209
I'm not like you, dude. In life.

25:43.251 --> 25:45.753
Look, since I first met you
I've seen you get rich,

25:46.003 --> 25:47.213
I've seen you succeed,

25:47.255 --> 25:50.216
I've seen you buy
20 houses like this.

25:50.258 --> 25:51.717
Being with every woman
you've desired

25:51.759 --> 25:53.719
and fallen in love with them.

25:53.761 --> 25:56.264
I don't know what the fuck you mean.
I just don't understand.

25:56.514 --> 25:59.767
You even have a fucking river,
a forest, you got--

26:03.771 --> 26:05.731
You know what's going on.

26:05.773 --> 26:08.276
You know what you want.

26:08.734 --> 26:11.237
You don't want to be
part of my life.

26:11.279 --> 26:13.281
You want to live my life.

26:13.948 --> 26:16.784
And there's no way, kid.

26:17.451 --> 26:21.539
You really pushed yourselves
so the three of us would live a lie.

26:22.039 --> 26:25.459
But I don't understand.
You didn't need anything.

26:25.501 --> 26:28.254
I even asked you a million times
to be part of my business.

26:28.296 --> 26:29.755
But you never wanted.

26:29.797 --> 26:31.257
You've never wanted
any responsibilities.

26:31.299 --> 26:34.260
Responsibilities?
What responsibilities do you have?

26:34.302 --> 26:36.762
Me? That's my problem.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.973
But I don't fuck no one's life
with them,

26:39.015 --> 26:40.766
let alone the lives of those I love.

26:40.808 --> 26:43.978
And listen closely,
when you want something

26:44.020 --> 26:46.272
you need the balls

26:46.314 --> 26:49.775
to grab them tightly
and make decisions.

26:49.817 --> 26:53.779
Grow a pair, kid.
That's how I got all of this.

26:53.821 --> 26:57.950
But no, not you...
you'd rather stay in the shadows.

26:57.992 --> 27:03.080
Back there, in a corner,
waiting for the right time to...

27:03.122 --> 27:06.792
fuck my wife. That's you, Marcos.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.836
And one more thing.

27:09.086 --> 27:13.799
I could have expected this from her.
But from my best friend?

27:13.841 --> 27:15.343
From you?

27:15.634 --> 27:19.847
You have no excuses. None.

27:20.348 --> 27:24.310
You didn't even have the balls
to tell me.

27:24.352 --> 27:25.311
Well, you're right.

27:25.353 --> 27:28.314
It was never my plan
to tell you, or hurt you.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.816
But leave her out of this,
she doesn't deserve it.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.319
You abandoned her. What,
you don't remember that either?

27:33.361 --> 27:35.529
I only want you to sign
those papers

27:35.571 --> 27:36.822
and go to hell.

27:36.864 --> 27:37.823
-Really?
-Yes.

27:37.865 --> 27:40.868
Fantastic. We're leaving.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.874
The agreement.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.876
Thank you.

27:53.381 --> 27:55.383
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

27:55.883 --> 27:57.343
Do you mind?

27:57.385 --> 27:59.845
If you breach your part
of the agreement,

27:59.887 --> 28:02.098
it will lose validity.

28:02.890 --> 28:05.643
And I assure you that in less
than 24 hours,

28:05.684 --> 28:08.854
those pictures will be delivered
to all of the media.

28:08.896 --> 28:10.356
You wouldn't dare, Borja.

28:14.402 --> 28:17.363
You're nuts if you think
we're going to do that.

28:17.405 --> 28:19.615
You're pissed? Fine,
I get it, you're pissed.

28:19.657 --> 28:21.867
But what else do you want?

28:21.909 --> 28:23.411
Leave.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.373
Borja.

28:27.415 --> 28:28.916
Okay, do it. I dare you.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.668
But it will be the last thing
you do, bastard.

28:30.709 --> 28:33.421
You're brave all of a sudden
in front of the lady--

28:33.921 --> 28:36.924
Do it. Do it! And I'll send you
to prison for five years.

28:37.174 --> 28:38.384
If you survive, of course.

28:38.426 --> 28:40.928
Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

28:43.514 --> 28:44.390
Listen.

28:44.432 --> 28:46.392
Keep your end of the deal,

28:46.434 --> 28:49.395
or I'll haunt you
with all my might.

28:49.437 --> 28:49.895
Borja...

28:49.937 --> 28:51.939
No, no. Please.

29:15.713 --> 29:17.882
-Hi.
-Hey.

29:17.923 --> 29:19.425
Listen, I need help.

29:19.467 --> 29:22.928
I was in an car accident
and there's no signal.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.930
I have to call my family
and tell them that I'm okay.

29:24.972 --> 29:28.642
My car won't start and I don't know
what's wrong with my phone.

29:28.684 --> 29:29.935
There's no signal, and--

29:29.977 --> 29:32.062
I'm sorry,
but I'm having a bad day.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.981
Welcome to the club.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.942
Maybe I can lend you
my phone and you can try.

29:36.984 --> 29:38.194
Please, come in.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.988
Yes, thank you.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.453
He won't stop
until he gets what he wants.

29:47.495 --> 29:50.456
He's being a fucking douchebag.
That's what he is doing.

29:50.498 --> 29:51.957
And I'm not playing along.

29:51.999 --> 29:54.168
There's no other choice.

29:54.210 --> 29:56.128
I barely recognize you, Cat.

29:56.170 --> 29:57.963
We're in this together,
don't forget it.

29:58.005 --> 29:58.964
Things turned out this way
because of both of us.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.508
-You think I don't know?
-Shh.

30:00.758 --> 30:03.135
I understand that,
but I won't play his game.

30:03.177 --> 30:04.512
Shut up.

30:05.763 --> 30:07.515
Let's go back in.

30:09.767 --> 30:10.768
There must be another way.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.479
-There's not.
-Didn't you read the fucking agreement?

30:13.521 --> 30:15.731
Let's go,
we'll talk to our lawyers

30:15.773 --> 30:16.857
and try to fix all of this.

30:16.899 --> 30:18.817
Do you really think that
it can be fixed like that?

30:18.859 --> 30:22.488
I don't know. But this is the worst
place to talk about it.

30:22.530 --> 30:24.823
And it's hard to understand
how he can be so sick

30:24.865 --> 30:25.491
to add that clause.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.992
But what if the pictures
come to light?

30:27.034 --> 30:29.495
-They won't.
-What if they do?

30:29.537 --> 30:33.541
Yes, mom. Yes, yes. No.
I'm fine.

30:34.041 --> 30:38.546
Okay. Good.
Yes, I'll wait here.

30:39.046 --> 30:40.756
What's your address?

30:40.798 --> 30:45.511
-65 Camino de la Arboleda.
-65 Camino de la Arboleda.

30:45.553 --> 30:47.221
The agreement clearly stipulates

30:47.263 --> 30:50.015
that if he breaches it,
he has to give up everything.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.518
And to be honest,
I doubt he'd want to lose it all.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.727
Let's find a way--

30:53.769 --> 30:55.521
-To what, refute those pictures?
-Yeah.

30:55.563 --> 30:58.524
He's filing for divorce,
and this shit will come out in court.

30:58.566 --> 31:02.069
Look. Stop, stop it.
You're not alone, okay?

31:05.573 --> 31:08.075
What is it? I know that face.

31:09.743 --> 31:11.829
We have to do it.

31:14.582 --> 31:16.333
Are you serious?

31:16.375 --> 31:19.044
You're going to let him
humiliate you like that?

31:19.086 --> 31:21.297
Yes, yes.

31:23.090 --> 31:27.052
Okay. No, don't worry.
I'm fine. Really.

31:27.094 --> 31:29.638
Yes, I got help. Yeah.

31:32.600 --> 31:34.018
Yes.

31:35.269 --> 31:37.771
Again, yes.

31:39.106 --> 31:45.112
Yeah. I'm okay, seriously.
A man helped me.

31:57.875 --> 31:59.293
WHERE ARE YOU?
I NEED YOUR HELP.

32:11.430 --> 32:15.142
Wait, wait, wait.

32:15.851 --> 32:17.603
Where's my phone?

32:17.645 --> 32:19.104
I think it's in my pants.

32:19.146 --> 32:22.608
-Need a hand?
-No, no. Don't move. Don't move.

32:22.650 --> 32:24.276
Sure?

32:25.152 --> 32:27.613
I'm not doing anything.

32:27.655 --> 32:33.160
I said, don't... move.

32:45.964 --> 32:49.677
It's ringing, it's ringing.
Move. Move, please.

32:56.975 --> 33:01.647
Cotiti. I'm doing nothing.
Count on me.

33:01.689 --> 33:02.648
Doing nothing?

33:02.690 --> 33:04.650
I'm on my way, don't worry.

33:04.692 --> 33:06.694
-Get out.
-Whoa! Hey.

33:16.912 --> 33:20.666
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

33:20.708 --> 33:24.712
I was trying to get signal.
But... no luck.

33:25.421 --> 33:28.173
It's definitely dead. Oh well!

33:28.215 --> 33:30.718
May it rest in peace.

33:32.720 --> 33:34.179
You know, today is
one of those days

33:34.221 --> 33:37.224
when I would've been better off
not getting out of bed.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.727
I know what you mean.

33:41.729 --> 33:47.192
Do you know any spots nearby
where I can wait or have a drink?

33:47.234 --> 33:49.194
If you want,
I can take a look at your car.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.363
I know a little about that.
I'm not an expert but...

33:51.405 --> 33:53.699
-No. No, it's not necessary.
-I can help.

33:53.741 --> 33:56.869
My mom is coming
and I don't want to bother.

33:56.910 --> 33:59.246
-It's nothing. Seriously.
-No.

33:59.747 --> 34:04.001
Don't. Um, sorry.
I'm sure you're a busy man.

34:04.042 --> 34:07.212
Maybe I should wait outside.

34:07.254 --> 34:08.714
It's no big deal.

34:08.756 --> 34:12.259
I insist. I need the fresh air.
Come on.

34:31.528 --> 34:33.280
Alright, I'll do it.

34:33.781 --> 34:36.742
But I'm giving up
so much too, okay?

34:36.784 --> 34:38.911
So, I want to make this
very clear.

34:38.952 --> 34:41.288
You're above anything else.

34:41.789 --> 34:44.750
It's a deal.
That's what they're made for.

34:44.792 --> 34:46.752
Do you think this will end here?

34:46.794 --> 34:49.296
No, of course not.
He won't let us live in peace.

34:49.338 --> 34:50.964
But if I let him humiliate me
this way,

34:51.006 --> 34:53.467
I will find a way
to defend myself.

34:53.509 --> 34:57.304
Otherwise, I'm only going
to feel the burden of guilt.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.311
Are you sure?

35:07.815 --> 35:10.317
What choice do we have? Hm?

35:14.822 --> 35:17.783
Whatever, no matter what we do,
he won't leave us alone.

35:17.825 --> 35:19.326
Yeah.

35:20.327 --> 35:23.330
We need to find the way
to get rid of him.

35:32.339 --> 35:36.301
Weird. It's okay when you start it.
But then something goes wrong.

35:36.343 --> 35:37.970
What can I do?

35:38.011 --> 35:42.808
Nothing. It must be the engine
or the belt. Something like that.

35:42.850 --> 35:45.853
I don't know anything about this.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.648
It's not-- It's not a big deal.

35:50.274 --> 35:51.608
Thank you.

35:51.650 --> 35:52.860
I didn't do anything.

35:53.110 --> 35:55.863
Well, at least you tried.

35:56.363 --> 35:58.824
Did you call a tow truck?

35:58.866 --> 36:01.827
Not yet. I want to wait
until they pick me up.

36:01.869 --> 36:05.831
But don't worry.

36:05.873 --> 36:07.833
I'll wait here.

36:07.875 --> 36:09.835
Thank you for everything.

36:09.877 --> 36:13.171
You can wait inside if you like.

36:13.881 --> 36:16.383
My mom won't take long.

36:17.384 --> 36:19.177
You gave her my address.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.847
She will look for you there.
And we'll have to come to pick you up.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.683
Oh, right.

36:25.893 --> 36:28.854
You're absolutely right.
I'm a mess.

36:28.896 --> 36:33.901
Um, would you tell her
I'm waiting here?

36:34.192 --> 36:38.864
Or maybe... can I go with you?

36:38.906 --> 36:41.867
Yes, of course. Let's go.

36:46.413 --> 36:48.373
Borja!

36:48.415 --> 36:50.876
-Where could he be?
-Catching some fresh air maybe.

36:50.918 --> 36:54.379
-This is fucking crazy.
-It is. Think it through.

36:54.421 --> 36:55.923
Yes.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.884
We're going to say
that it was in self defense

36:58.926 --> 36:59.885
and they will believe us.

36:59.927 --> 37:03.388
Desperate situations call
for desperate measures.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.890
You're confident, right?

37:04.932 --> 37:05.891
Who cares?

37:05.933 --> 37:07.601
I do.

37:07.643 --> 37:10.395
I need to feel that I'm not
doing this only for myself.

37:10.437 --> 37:13.106
I told you, you're not alone, okay?

37:13.148 --> 37:15.651
It's important to know
the next steps.

37:15.692 --> 37:18.445
And having the same story.

37:19.446 --> 37:21.740
The real question is, are you sure?

37:37.172 --> 37:38.966
There it is.

37:39.925 --> 37:44.471
-Oh, I forgot my stuff. One second.
-Sure. Don't worry.

37:57.985 --> 38:00.237
Borja is calling.
What the fuck do I do?

38:00.278 --> 38:01.989
Don't answer.

38:30.767 --> 38:32.978
It's getting a little cold, huh?

38:33.020 --> 38:35.022
Yes. You're right.

38:36.523 --> 38:39.985
You really don't mind
that I wait in your house?

38:40.027 --> 38:42.487
No. Not at all.

38:42.529 --> 38:45.490
Trust me, I would tell you if I did.

38:45.532 --> 38:47.534
Lately, I don't hold anything in.

38:47.951 --> 38:51.496
That's great. Lately,
only few men are like that.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.998
Sincere.

38:53.040 --> 38:55.000
I'M IN

38:58.545 --> 39:00.047
Okay.

39:01.048 --> 39:04.009
Once we've done it, we need
his fingerprints on the gun.

39:04.051 --> 39:04.551
Alright?

39:04.801 --> 39:07.512
He found out about us,
made you sign the agreement,

39:07.554 --> 39:09.556
and I refused to do
what he wanted, okay?

39:09.806 --> 39:11.266
He tried to kick you out,

39:11.308 --> 39:14.561
packed your things, and lost it.
Alright?

39:15.062 --> 39:17.564
-Then I--
-You?

39:18.065 --> 39:20.025
In self defense.

39:20.067 --> 39:21.526
Let's see how everything
plays out this evening

39:21.568 --> 39:22.527
and we will find
the right moment.

39:22.569 --> 39:25.072
How are we going to do it?
Will you dare?

39:25.322 --> 39:28.033
Listen, we will do
what he wants, okay?

39:28.075 --> 39:29.326
We're going to have sex
in front of him

39:29.367 --> 39:31.078
and do what's in the agreement.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.831
Baby, he will go berserk.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.542
Okay? I'm going to provoke him,
don't worry. Let's go.

39:37.584 --> 39:41.588
Okay then... sign.

39:44.091 --> 39:46.593
Go on. Sign it.

39:48.345 --> 39:50.097
Dear Lord.

40:24.131 --> 40:26.133
Fuck it.

40:28.135 --> 40:30.595
Let's make clear that we did
everything he asked,

40:30.637 --> 40:31.930
we even signed the agreement,

40:31.972 --> 40:33.348
and yet, things got complicated,
okay?

40:33.390 --> 40:34.099
Okay, calm down.

40:34.141 --> 40:36.143
A glass of wine?

40:39.646 --> 40:42.149
-Who's with him?
-I don't know.

40:42.649 --> 40:45.110
-Um... sure.
-Yes?

40:45.152 --> 40:47.612
Look who's here, the lovebirds.

40:47.654 --> 40:51.158
I called you. I thought
you had fled or something.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.162
Hi.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.664
Nice to meet you.

40:59.166 --> 41:00.625
And you are...

41:00.667 --> 41:01.918
She's...

41:01.960 --> 41:03.128
-Jennifer.
-Jennifer.

41:03.170 --> 41:06.173
I'm Jennifer. I had a little
problem with my car and--

41:06.214 --> 41:08.925
She had a little mishap
right outside, on the road.

41:08.967 --> 41:11.136
And since we're
so welcoming lately

41:11.178 --> 41:13.638
and let anyone in...

41:13.680 --> 41:15.682
I told her to stay.

41:16.183 --> 41:19.186
This is my faithful wife, Cat.

41:21.188 --> 41:22.689
Are you okay?

41:23.190 --> 41:26.484
Yes. Um... I'm fine.

41:27.694 --> 41:30.697
But it's been a crazy day and--

41:31.198 --> 41:32.699
-Borja.
-Borja.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.661
She still doesn't know.
You don't know this,

41:36.703 --> 41:40.165
but you're witness of one of the most
important evenings of our lives.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.083
And we just met.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.877
Amazing.

41:43.919 --> 41:46.338
Let's go outside while you wait

41:46.379 --> 41:48.173
and you make up your mind?

41:48.506 --> 41:50.175
What was your name again?

41:50.425 --> 41:52.177
-Marcos.
-Marcos.

41:52.219 --> 41:53.720
It's a pleasure.

41:54.512 --> 41:56.681
Um, he tried to help with my car.

41:56.723 --> 41:58.725
It's okay, come with me.

42:03.730 --> 42:05.232
This way.

42:35.512 --> 42:39.015
It feels like I'm
interrupting something.

42:39.057 --> 42:40.725
No, why?

42:40.767 --> 42:42.269
I don't know.

42:44.020 --> 42:46.231
It's okay, Jennifer.

42:46.273 --> 42:48.733
Borja is a great host. Aren't you?

42:48.775 --> 42:51.778
He arranged a wonderful evening.

42:52.445 --> 42:55.448
Let's celebrate.
For the good times.

42:55.490 --> 42:57.409
Just as you wanted.

42:57.450 --> 42:59.744
Why the sudden change of heart?

42:59.786 --> 43:02.289
Do you want to discuss this
in front of our guest?

43:05.041 --> 43:06.751
How is your mother going
to call you when she arrives?

43:06.793 --> 43:10.755
Oh, yes. Right.
I'm sorry, I'm exhausted.

43:10.797 --> 43:13.591
Um, my phone is dead.

43:14.134 --> 43:15.302
Right.

43:15.719 --> 43:17.304
Excuse me.

43:24.519 --> 43:26.313
So, what happened?

43:27.814 --> 43:29.316
This is too much for me.

43:30.317 --> 43:33.778
Excuse me, can I use your bathroom?

43:33.820 --> 43:35.780
Sure. There's one upstairs.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.824
Thank you.

43:40.827 --> 43:44.789
Well. This calls a celebration.

43:44.831 --> 43:48.460
-Do you feel better now?
-No, the usual.

43:48.501 --> 43:50.795
But this will be a more
entertaining evening now.

43:50.837 --> 43:53.298
This is too much
for me too, you know.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.799
Right.

43:54.841 --> 43:56.843
You'll bring her now?

43:57.344 --> 44:00.847
I'll bring some glasses.
I thought you wanted a toast.

45:23.930 --> 45:25.932
Fuck.

45:45.452 --> 45:49.956
Hey, kid.
Where exactly are you heading?

45:51.124 --> 45:52.917
Valle de Bravo.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.461
Documents.

46:00.675 --> 46:03.720
Alfonso Fernandez Cuevas.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.972
I'll be right back.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.487
What are you doing?

46:30.997 --> 46:34.250
You know that I like
to keep things tidy.

46:35.001 --> 46:37.754
I want your new friend
out of here.

46:38.505 --> 46:40.006
Now you're jealous?

46:41.007 --> 46:43.510
It's a bit too late for that,
don't you think?

46:53.228 --> 46:55.480
How do you want us to do it?

46:55.522 --> 46:57.524
I don't understand, honey.

46:57.774 --> 47:00.485
How, when, and where do you
want me to fuck your wife.

47:00.527 --> 47:03.029
You've always been imaginative.

47:18.336 --> 47:20.046
To you.

47:21.256 --> 47:23.800
Go get her, or I will.

47:27.554 --> 47:29.055
Relax, okay?

47:29.305 --> 47:32.517
Given the circumstances,
it's better to let yourself go.

47:32.559 --> 47:36.062
We need our plan to succeed.

47:39.065 --> 47:43.361
Yeah, relax. We're all grown-ups.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.030
Finally you say something logic.

47:46.072 --> 47:47.782
You like this?

47:52.745 --> 47:56.082
Stop. Not here.

48:02.755 --> 48:05.091
Do you really want us to do this?

48:05.592 --> 48:09.095
Tonight's going to be a great night.

48:10.763 --> 48:13.558
The plate's clean.
Everything's okay.

48:13.600 --> 48:16.227
Thank you, officer.
Can I go now?

48:16.269 --> 48:21.107
-Alright. Drive safely.
-Thank you.

49:21.250 --> 49:23.169
Fuck.

49:23.670 --> 49:24.629
What?

49:24.671 --> 49:26.631
I must confess
I wasn't expecting this.

49:26.673 --> 49:28.675
I know you way less
than I thought.

49:28.925 --> 49:30.635
I was alone for too long, maybe?

49:30.677 --> 49:32.178
Come here.

49:35.932 --> 49:37.975
Okay, stop.

49:39.686 --> 49:41.187
Not here.

49:44.899 --> 49:46.693
Are you coming?

49:49.195 --> 49:50.697
Come on!

50:01.999 --> 50:06.671
Mr. Riscal. Mr. Riscal!

50:06.713 --> 50:11.843
Look, my wife was cheating on me
with mt best friend, and I--

50:11.884 --> 50:13.678
I don't know why
I made that deal.

50:13.720 --> 50:15.430
I guess I don't know
myself very well,

50:15.471 --> 50:16.889
and I wasn't expecting
something like that.

50:16.931 --> 50:20.184
-Like what?
-Like that, it got out of hand.

50:20.226 --> 50:22.186
This is the thing,

50:22.228 --> 50:24.355
your wife, despite being
out of danger now,

50:24.397 --> 50:27.692
was admitted to the emergency room,
after she was shot on the leg.

50:27.734 --> 50:31.696
We haven't talked to her,
but we talked to her lawyer, Alfred.

50:31.738 --> 50:33.698
And he said
that you threatened her

50:33.740 --> 50:35.700
with filing for the divorce.

50:35.742 --> 50:37.243
She didn't take it well.

50:37.493 --> 50:39.203
We also found an agreement

50:39.245 --> 50:42.206
where you force her to give up
her shares of your company

50:42.248 --> 50:45.209
and have intercourse
with Mr. Marcos Source

50:45.251 --> 50:47.712
witnessed by you.

50:47.754 --> 50:50.590
Specifically, on the eighth clause.

52:52.879 --> 52:54.881
No... I can't.

52:55.381 --> 52:56.883
Not like this.

53:02.388 --> 53:04.390
Seriously, Borja?

53:06.392 --> 53:09.854
There's a woman in my house and
I have no fucking idea of who she is.

53:09.896 --> 53:12.899
Can we at least wait
until she's gone?

53:23.910 --> 53:26.370
What the fuck is wrong with you?
What were you thinking?

53:26.412 --> 53:28.497
-Shh. Calm down. It's okay.
-Are you crazy too?

53:28.539 --> 53:30.041
Calm down.

53:32.418 --> 53:33.920
Come here.

54:33.771 --> 54:34.939
I didn't see you.

54:34.981 --> 54:38.234
You were taking too long.
I was worried.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.486
It's a girls thing.

54:43.489 --> 54:45.491
Thank you.

55:27.742 --> 55:30.953
This is fucking nuts.

55:42.339 --> 55:44.508
Remember when we were stuck
in the middle of the desert?

55:44.550 --> 55:45.509
I remember how we got there.

55:45.551 --> 55:48.721
But I don't know
how we managed to get out.

55:48.763 --> 55:50.014
You and Jennifer have no idea,

55:50.056 --> 55:52.016
but this is a celebration.

55:52.058 --> 55:54.060
What are you celebrating?

55:55.061 --> 55:58.022
Freedom. Freedom.

55:58.064 --> 56:00.524
You're having so much fun.

56:00.566 --> 56:02.026
I feel liberated, I can't lie.

56:02.068 --> 56:02.943
I'm free.

56:02.985 --> 56:05.571
Have you guys known each other
for a long time?

56:06.572 --> 56:09.033
Well, "known each other"...

56:09.075 --> 56:10.534
You ought to be more specific.

56:10.576 --> 56:11.535
For many years now.

56:11.577 --> 56:12.578
It's been a while, yes.

56:12.828 --> 56:14.830
Those are
the best friendships, right?

56:14.872 --> 56:16.540
You have no idea.

56:16.582 --> 56:17.541
Right?

56:17.583 --> 56:20.044
Listen. Hey, hey.

56:20.086 --> 56:21.587
Marcos!

56:22.088 --> 56:25.591
Hey, relax! Cut it out.

56:27.093 --> 56:29.095
Listen.

56:32.098 --> 56:34.558
Didn't you say
there was no signal?

56:34.600 --> 56:39.105
I'm just checking.
Hope is the last to die.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.614
What do you do for a living?

56:53.619 --> 56:55.287
I'm a Chief Financial Officer.

56:55.329 --> 56:57.665
Chief Financial Officer?

57:01.127 --> 57:06.632
Sorry but...
you don't look like one.

57:07.133 --> 57:08.884
Well, I'm not working right now.

57:08.926 --> 57:11.595
Neither am I.
They just fired me.

57:11.637 --> 57:14.640
But you can't complain.
You live well.

57:15.224 --> 57:17.101
I mean, not really.

57:17.143 --> 57:19.145
All of this belongs
to my husband.

57:22.648 --> 57:25.609
The fucking eighth clause!

57:25.651 --> 57:27.611
Marcos, you've drunk enough.
Stop it.

57:27.653 --> 57:31.157
Cheers.
What's the eighth clause?

57:31.198 --> 57:33.617
You don't know what it is?
No?

57:33.659 --> 57:37.121
I'll explain it to you.
I'll explain it to you.

57:37.163 --> 57:38.622
Stop it, Marcos, you're too drunk.

57:38.664 --> 57:41.125
Fuck, let me explain.
Let me explain.

57:41.167 --> 57:42.626
Our good friend Borja--

57:42.668 --> 57:44.628
Enough! You're saying too much.

57:44.670 --> 57:46.839
What? You don't know
what I'm going to say.

57:46.881 --> 57:48.174
He is Cat's husband.

57:48.424 --> 57:50.634
Well, let's say future
ex husband, okay?

57:50.676 --> 57:52.136
Oops.

57:52.178 --> 57:54.180
He's not sad, or destroyed,
hell no!

57:54.430 --> 57:56.140
This is a modern man
from the 21st century.

57:56.182 --> 57:57.141
With big balls, right?

57:57.183 --> 57:59.351
He's always...
Always seeing the bright side

57:59.393 --> 58:01.145
even in the worst of situations,
you know.

58:01.187 --> 58:02.146
Will you shut up?

58:02.188 --> 58:03.647
No, I won't. I'm not saying
anything wrong.

58:03.689 --> 58:05.149
So let me say what I have to say.

58:05.191 --> 58:07.151
Look, I'll give you some context.

58:07.193 --> 58:09.153
He can't deal with failure, okay?

58:09.195 --> 58:10.946
So he decided to turn his divorce

58:10.988 --> 58:13.157
-into a competition.
-Stop it, Marcos, please.

58:13.199 --> 58:14.909
-You shut up.
-Excuse me?

58:14.950 --> 58:17.161
Careful how you talk to my wife!

58:17.203 --> 58:19.163
I will explain the situation.
Listen to me.

58:19.205 --> 58:22.166
He made up a deal.
A fucking agreement

58:22.208 --> 58:23.667
where he snatches
everything from his wife.

58:23.709 --> 58:24.668
-Marcos!
-What?

58:24.710 --> 58:26.170
Enough! That's it.

58:26.212 --> 58:27.671
-Marcos, please.
-No, let me--

58:27.713 --> 58:29.673
So he looked into the shit.

58:29.715 --> 58:31.675
That's what he was looking for.
Me.

58:31.717 --> 58:34.178
-Marcos, stop.
-His fucking agreement says

58:34.220 --> 58:36.889
that I have to fuck his wife
in front of him.

58:36.931 --> 58:37.848
How about that!

58:37.890 --> 58:40.184
Interesting.

58:40.226 --> 58:40.726
Great.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.186
Is it true or not, baby?

58:42.228 --> 58:43.896
-Is it or is it not?
-Stop. Stop it, Marcos!

58:43.938 --> 58:45.189
No, I won't stop.

58:45.231 --> 58:48.359
You're a coward, dude.
You're a fucking coward.

58:48.400 --> 58:50.694
Instead of facing it like a man
and have the balls--

58:50.736 --> 58:51.695
Motherfucker!

58:51.737 --> 58:53.239
-Ah!
-Marcos!

58:54.740 --> 58:56.742
Son of a bitch.

58:57.243 --> 59:00.746
Shit. Where the fuck is it?
Where is it?

59:01.747 --> 59:03.707
Hey! Hey! Enough!

59:03.749 --> 59:06.877
Stop, that's it, I'm not
even bleeding, so stop it.

59:06.919 --> 59:08.754
Let's call the police,
this is assault,

59:08.796 --> 59:10.422
-it's in the agreement.
-We're not calling anybody.

59:10.464 --> 59:12.716
You understand, right?
We have a fucking witness.

59:12.758 --> 59:15.761
It's over, okay?

59:17.763 --> 59:21.267
I'm so fed up with him.
I can't deal with this anymore.

59:25.271 --> 59:26.772
Are you okay?

59:27.773 --> 59:29.566
I don't know.

59:32.278 --> 59:34.780
You still love him, huh?

59:35.281 --> 59:37.783
Answer me, do you still love him?

59:38.284 --> 59:39.743
Do you really want to go on
with this?

59:39.785 --> 59:41.245
Of course, because this is
your fault,

59:41.287 --> 59:42.288
do you get it or not?

59:42.329 --> 59:44.290
This is all because of you.

1:01:00.032 --> 1:01:02.826
They have jewels, watches.

1:01:02.868 --> 1:01:05.871
I'm sure they have cash.

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:08.874
Shit.

1:01:13.045 --> 1:01:15.839
If you do what I say,
no one will get hurt.

1:01:15.881 --> 1:01:18.342
But if you try anything,
I'll shoot you, okay?

1:01:18.384 --> 1:01:20.844
-Wait.
-Shut up.

1:01:20.886 --> 1:01:22.846
From now on, only I will speak.

1:01:22.888 --> 1:01:23.847
What do you want?

1:01:23.889 --> 1:01:26.016
Play hide and seek.

1:01:26.058 --> 1:01:28.394
Where's the safe box?

1:01:31.897 --> 1:01:34.400
Tell me where's the safe box.

1:01:41.407 --> 1:01:43.200
Don't move.

1:01:44.910 --> 1:01:47.913
-Cotiti.
-Why are you taking so long, baby?

1:01:48.163 --> 1:01:50.374
I'm outside the house,
I can see it from here. Calm down.

1:01:50.416 --> 1:01:52.376
Let me know when you're on
the front door, okay?

1:01:52.418 --> 1:01:53.877
-Listen.
-Shh.

1:01:53.919 --> 1:01:55.546
What's that, you got caught?

1:01:55.587 --> 1:01:58.382
Kind of.
But everything's under control

1:01:58.424 --> 1:02:00.426
Let me know, okay?

1:02:05.931 --> 1:02:07.599
I'm sorry I hit you.

1:02:07.641 --> 1:02:09.184
I shouldn't have. Are you okay?

1:02:09.226 --> 1:02:12.396
Yes, I'm fine, don't worry.
It was my fault.

1:02:12.438 --> 1:02:14.690
Alcohol and I
don't get along that well.

1:02:14.731 --> 1:02:16.442
Where's Cat?

1:02:17.443 --> 1:02:19.445
She was looking for you.

1:02:20.737 --> 1:02:24.700
I want you to know that...
I didn't want this to happen.

1:02:24.741 --> 1:02:26.452
Are you going to kill me?

1:02:27.953 --> 1:02:29.413
Don't try to fool me.

1:02:29.455 --> 1:02:31.623
I just texted my lawyer

1:02:31.665 --> 1:02:33.417
telling him that my gun
is gone from the safe!

1:02:33.459 --> 1:02:34.918
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

1:02:34.960 --> 1:02:37.421
Only Cat and I know the code.

1:02:37.463 --> 1:02:38.922
But Cat is unpredictable.

1:02:38.964 --> 1:02:40.924
You two are so fucked.
If anything happens to me--

1:02:40.966 --> 1:02:42.926
Why were you looking
for the gun?

1:02:42.968 --> 1:02:44.970
Are you planning to get rid of me?

1:02:47.473 --> 1:02:49.933
I don't know. You tell me.

1:02:49.975 --> 1:02:52.728
Do it! Do it, fucker!
If you have the balls!

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:53.937
Do it, you coward!

1:02:53.979 --> 1:02:54.938
Borja.

1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:55.939
Listen.

1:02:55.981 --> 1:02:58.942
Show me your hands and don't move
or I'll blow her brains.

1:02:58.984 --> 1:03:01.195
Whoa, whoa! What's going on?

1:03:01.236 --> 1:03:03.947
If you do exactly what I say,
this will be quick

1:03:03.989 --> 1:03:05.449
and no one is going to get hurt.

1:03:05.491 --> 1:03:07.451
There's CCTV all over the place,
you know that, right?

1:03:07.493 --> 1:03:09.786
Seriously. Think twice.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:12.498
Thank you, you're so kind.

1:03:12.539 --> 1:03:13.290
Don't move, okay?

1:03:18.003 --> 1:03:19.796
You, open the door!

1:03:20.797 --> 1:03:22.508
Why aren't you moving?
Open the fucking door!

1:03:22.549 --> 1:03:23.467
Okay, okay, calm down.

1:03:23.509 --> 1:03:25.511
Move, fucker. Move.

1:03:26.011 --> 1:03:28.472
Don't try anything stupid.
You know the consequences.

1:03:28.514 --> 1:03:31.016
-Move!
-I'm on it.

1:03:34.686 --> 1:03:41.527
Whoa! Easy. Follow my orders.

1:03:47.241 --> 1:03:49.034
Turn around.

1:03:56.708 --> 1:03:58.502
Look.

1:03:58.544 --> 1:04:00.504
You son of a bitch.

1:04:00.546 --> 1:04:03.549
Easy, okay? Easy.

1:04:06.552 --> 1:04:08.053
Move.

1:04:10.055 --> 1:04:12.015
What's up, people?

1:04:12.057 --> 1:04:13.517
Good evening.

1:04:13.559 --> 1:04:17.020
Let me introduce myself,
I am... your best friend.

1:04:17.062 --> 1:04:19.773
Or your fucking worst nightmare.

1:04:19.815 --> 1:04:22.067
It depends on how things go.

1:04:22.568 --> 1:04:26.029
I'm here to fulfill
my necessities.

1:04:26.071 --> 1:04:29.032
And in order to do that,
I need you to listen carefully

1:04:29.074 --> 1:04:32.077
and do everything I ask.
Understood?

1:04:36.081 --> 1:04:37.874
Understood?

1:04:38.584 --> 1:04:40.085
Yes.

1:04:43.755 --> 1:04:45.048
I can't hear you, motherfucker.

1:04:45.090 --> 1:04:48.093
Yes, understood. Understood.

1:04:49.720 --> 1:04:55.100
Fuck! Now we're talking.
The air feels different.

1:05:16.121 --> 1:05:18.749
The safe box is downstairs.

1:05:18.790 --> 1:05:21.585
Good. Tie them.

1:05:21.627 --> 1:05:22.878
I'll take care of the rest.

1:05:22.919 --> 1:05:26.089
No, you do it. Go.

1:05:26.131 --> 1:05:27.883
Do it, baby.

1:05:27.924 --> 1:05:32.095
Listen, kids,
time to play a little game.

1:05:32.137 --> 1:05:33.889
Put your backs together!

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:38.143
Okay. Done.
Calm down. Please.

1:05:43.899 --> 1:05:46.610
They broke into my house
and shot my wife.

1:05:46.652 --> 1:05:48.111
You two argued,

1:05:48.153 --> 1:05:50.656
your wife wanted to leave
but you wouldn't let her,

1:05:50.906 --> 1:05:52.616
and as it says here
in the statement,

1:05:52.658 --> 1:05:55.661
one thing led to another
and you shot her.

1:05:56.161 --> 1:05:59.164
The gun has your fingerprints
and it's under your name.

1:06:02.668 --> 1:06:04.169
Done.

1:06:07.673 --> 1:06:09.466
Fuck.

1:06:10.676 --> 1:06:13.178
We meet many idiots
like yourselves.

1:06:14.846 --> 1:06:16.807
My mom is here.

1:06:23.355 --> 1:06:24.648
Hands.

1:06:24.690 --> 1:06:26.650
Don't dare to touch me.

1:06:26.692 --> 1:06:29.194
-Whoa.
-What did you tell him?

1:06:29.695 --> 1:06:33.156
Shut your fucking mouth
or I'll do it for you, bitch.

1:06:33.198 --> 1:06:34.866
Who's laughing now?

1:06:34.908 --> 1:06:36.076
Fucking bitch.

1:06:38.412 --> 1:06:39.705
Whoa! Whoa! Fucker!

1:06:40.831 --> 1:06:42.165
The fuck are you doing?

1:06:42.207 --> 1:06:43.709
Give it to me!

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:47.879
-Hey!
-Next time it won't be her leg.

1:06:47.921 --> 1:06:50.465
It's okay. It's okay.

1:06:50.507 --> 1:06:51.675
Turn around!

1:06:51.717 --> 1:06:54.386
-Ah, shit!
-Let me see.

1:06:54.428 --> 1:06:56.680
-Cotiti!
-Fuck them.

1:06:56.722 --> 1:06:58.932
No, no, no!
What the fuck did you do?

1:06:58.974 --> 1:07:00.183
-Well--
-What do I always tell you?

1:07:00.225 --> 1:07:02.185
-I told them!
-Where's the CCTV?

1:07:02.227 --> 1:07:03.228
Downstairs.

1:07:03.729 --> 1:07:05.230
Fuck.

1:07:06.898 --> 1:07:09.192
Listen, I know what
you might be thinking,

1:07:09.234 --> 1:07:11.695
but it's not true. Listen to me.

1:07:11.737 --> 1:07:16.199
I was planning to fuck them hard.
It's true.

1:07:16.241 --> 1:07:19.202
But I would never...
want to hurt them physically.

1:07:19.244 --> 1:07:21.204
I'm not a murderer.

1:07:21.747 --> 1:07:24.708
I'll say it again, your wife
was shot

1:07:24.750 --> 1:07:26.501
with your gun.

1:08:05.290 --> 1:08:07.584
They took the gun.

1:08:08.043 --> 1:08:09.252
And set me up.

1:08:09.294 --> 1:08:12.422
-They?
-Yes. They want to fuck me up.

1:08:12.464 --> 1:08:14.800
Look, when your wife
is fully conscious

1:08:15.050 --> 1:08:16.760
an agent will question her

1:08:16.802 --> 1:08:18.762
to confirm everything
you just said.

1:08:18.804 --> 1:08:22.015
To be honest, Mr. Riscal,
your wife is your best hope

1:08:22.057 --> 1:08:24.768
to avoid being prosecuted
for attempted murder.

1:08:24.810 --> 1:08:26.978
The CCTV! There's CCTV!

1:08:27.020 --> 1:08:28.563
It must have been recorder,
you can verify there.

1:08:28.605 --> 1:08:32.275
We did, and nothing was recorded
from the last 24 hours.

1:08:32.317 --> 1:08:32.776
What?

1:08:32.818 --> 1:08:35.779
I'm assuming that after asking
your wife and your best friend

1:08:35.821 --> 1:08:39.825
to have intercourse, you didn't
want any recordings, right?

1:08:45.288 --> 1:08:47.207
Arrgh! It really hurts.

1:08:47.833 --> 1:08:49.292
Give me your belt.

1:08:49.334 --> 1:08:51.044
Cotiti, what the fuck is this?

1:08:51.086 --> 1:08:53.630
Baby, the belt.

1:08:57.092 --> 1:08:58.134
Raise your leg.

1:09:07.060 --> 1:09:09.312
Can someone explain
what the fuck is going on?

1:09:09.354 --> 1:09:12.357
Calm down, okay? We made a deal.

1:09:13.567 --> 1:09:14.985
One moment.

1:09:16.361 --> 1:09:20.365
Let's make a deal.

1:09:23.869 --> 1:09:26.371
One more time.

1:09:28.081 --> 1:09:30.333
The safe box code is...

1:09:30.375 --> 1:09:34.337
the date of our wedding,
03/06/13.

1:09:34.379 --> 1:09:36.840
Okay, what else?

1:09:36.882 --> 1:09:39.384
The security controls
are in the office.

1:09:39.634 --> 1:09:45.348
-The code is 8436... 19.
-36... 19. Great.

1:09:45.390 --> 1:09:48.852
You need to delete the last
24 hours and turn it off.

1:09:48.894 --> 1:09:50.395
Okay.

1:09:56.902 --> 1:09:59.404
I need you to wake him up.

1:10:00.196 --> 1:10:01.907
Do it.

1:10:27.933 --> 1:10:29.935
Hi, baby.

1:10:45.200 --> 1:10:46.910
Bingo.

1:11:23.989 --> 1:11:28.493
-Motherfucker! Hey!
-Cat, Cat, Cat!

1:11:33.999 --> 1:11:36.167
Fucking bitch.

1:11:36.209 --> 1:11:38.461
Fucking bitch.

1:11:38.503 --> 1:11:41.006
The gun was in the safe.

1:11:41.506 --> 1:11:44.509
Only she and I know the code.

1:11:49.514 --> 1:11:51.516
There it is.

1:11:51.558 --> 1:11:53.351
At the back.

1:11:58.023 --> 1:11:59.524
Okay.

1:12:01.026 --> 1:12:02.986
We will carry out
an investigation

1:12:03.028 --> 1:12:05.989
to confirm everything
you're saying.

1:12:06.031 --> 1:12:07.991
I want to speak with my wife.

1:12:08.033 --> 1:12:10.535
In due time, Mr. Riscal.

1:12:11.327 --> 1:12:12.996
Can I make a call?

1:12:13.038 --> 1:12:14.998
My advice is,
wait for your lawyer

1:12:15.040 --> 1:12:17.500
and he'll suggest what to do.

1:12:17.542 --> 1:12:19.544
Do you have a husband?

1:12:20.045 --> 1:12:22.047
Wife.

1:12:30.680 --> 1:12:32.265
3 DAYS LATER

1:13:10.095 --> 1:13:11.596
Get in.

1:13:47.423 --> 1:13:49.634
I talked to the police

1:13:53.638 --> 1:13:56.099
and told them that after dinner,

1:13:56.141 --> 1:14:00.145
a pair of burglars broke in
and pointed at us.

1:14:00.645 --> 1:14:03.606
They shot me in the leg,
and when you tried to protect me,

1:14:03.648 --> 1:14:07.152
they beat you up,
and you fell unconscious.

1:14:07.652 --> 1:14:11.156
What about Marcos? Where is he?

1:14:14.159 --> 1:14:16.911
-We need to take you to a hospital.
-Don't worry.

1:14:17.370 --> 1:14:18.913
I'm okay.

1:14:18.955 --> 1:14:24.377
Listen. Remember when you said
that you'd do anything for me?

1:14:24.419 --> 1:14:27.672
Of course I remember!

1:14:28.173 --> 1:14:30.633
That has nothing to do with this.
We need to call an ambulance.

1:14:30.675 --> 1:14:33.678
Relax. I'm fine.

1:14:37.182 --> 1:14:38.975
I'm sorry.

1:15:35.740 --> 1:15:40.745
You have 24 hours to sign.
Read it thoroughly.

1:15:40.995 --> 1:15:42.747
Take your time.

1:15:45.541 --> 1:15:49.254
Oh, and your lawyer,
our lawyer...

1:15:49.754 --> 1:15:52.257
is now my lawyer.

1:15:53.258 --> 1:15:58.221
This is a low blow, my father
thought of you as a friend.

1:15:58.263 --> 1:16:01.557
I wish he was alive
to see you as the snake you are.

1:16:38.803 --> 1:16:46.311
-Hello? This is a surprise.
-I need you. Urgently.

1:16:53.318 --> 1:16:54.986
Where are we going?

1:16:55.028 --> 1:16:57.322
Home, honey.

1:16:57.822 --> 1:16:59.824
We're going home.

1:17:35.860 --> 1:17:37.028
Good morning.

1:17:37.070 --> 1:17:39.781
-Morning, sir.
-I don't want any calls, please.

1:17:42.867 --> 1:17:44.869
It's been so long.

1:17:45.119 --> 1:17:49.832
Fantastic. Just a couple details,
but everything's okay.

1:17:49.874 --> 1:17:53.086
Love trumps again, right?

1:17:53.127 --> 1:17:56.339
That's crazy. Thank you.

1:17:56.381 --> 1:17:58.633
You don't have to thank me.

1:17:58.674 --> 1:18:00.301
You don't know what you
just avoided.

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:01.844
Yes. Yes, I know.

1:18:01.886 --> 1:18:05.348
That's why I sent you an envelope
with the new deal

1:18:05.390 --> 1:18:07.642
and a copy of the proof

1:18:07.683 --> 1:18:09.644
of what really happened
that night.

1:18:09.685 --> 1:18:12.397
You don't want
the truth to be known, right?

1:18:12.647 --> 1:18:14.399
She would become
a murder suspect.

1:18:14.649 --> 1:18:18.861
-Hey, that wasn't the deal.
- Why, did we sign an agreement?

1:18:18.903 --> 1:18:20.363
Call me back when you read it.

1:18:20.405 --> 1:18:23.199
And don't worry,
if I fall, you all fall.
