No, they didn't.

But it wasn't for lack of trying.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.664
Them peckerwoods
left their homes and families,

for killing Johnny Reb?

31:14.780 --> 31:17.465
You joined the war to keep niggers in chains.

31:17.620 --> 31:19.463
I joined the war to kill

- white Southern crackers.
- O.B.: Ha! Get up!

31:21.300 --> 31:23.348
And that means killing 'em any way I can.

...that's what I joined the war to do.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.860
And that's what I did.

31:36.980 --> 31:39.028
To answer your question, John Ruth,

31:39.180 --> 31:43.071
when Major Marquis burned 47 men alive,

31:43.180 --> 31:45.990
for no more reason than to give
a nigger a run for the trees,

31:46.100 --> 31:49.306
that's when the South put a reward
on the head of Major Marquis.

31:49.420 --> 31:51.184
- And I made them trees, Mannix.
- O.B.: Get in!

31:51.300 --> 31:54.904
You best believe I ain't looked back
till I crossed the Northern line.

31:55.020 --> 31:58.942
Oh, but you had a surprise waiting for
you on the Northern side, didn't you?

31:59.060 --> 32:03.420
See, once they started pulling out
all them burnt bodies at Wellenbeck,

32:03.580 --> 32:05.901
seems not all them boys were rebs.

32:06.020 --> 32:10.425
Why, you burn up some of your
own boys, didn't you, Major?

32:10.540 --> 32:12.907
How many burnt prisoners they end up finding?

32:13.020 --> 32:17.420
Wasn't the final Yankee death
count something like 37?

32:17.540 --> 32:18.905
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- (REINS CRACKING)

32:19.020 --> 32:20.704
That's the thing about war, Mannix.

32:20.820 --> 32:22.265
People die.

32:22.380 --> 32:23.711
Oh.

32:23.820 --> 32:26.903
So you gonna chalk it up
to "war is hell," huh?

32:27.060 --> 32:29.461
Well, admittedly, that is
a hard argument to argue with.

32:29.580 --> 32:31.469
But if memory serves,

32:31.580 --> 32:34.948
your side didn't look at it that way.

32:35.060 --> 32:37.461
I think they thought 37 white men

32:37.580 --> 32:39.947
for one nigger

32:40.060 --> 32:42.222
wasn't so hot a trade.

32:42.340 --> 32:45.628
- I do believe they accused you
- O.B.: Giddyup!

32:45.740 --> 32:47.026
...of being a kill-crazy nigger

32:47.140 --> 32:49.222
who only joined the war to kill white folks,

32:49.340 --> 32:52.147
and the whole blue and gray of it all
really didn't matter that much to you.

32:52.260 --> 32:53.705
O.B.: Ha! Get up!

32:53.820 --> 32:55.822
And that's why they drummed your black ass

32:55.940 --> 32:58.341
out of the cavalry with
a yellow stripe down your back.

32:58.460 --> 33:01.623
- O.B.: Get in!
- Isn't it, Major?

33:01.740 --> 33:03.105
Horseshit!

33:03.220 --> 33:04.665
If he'd have did all that, the cavalry

33:04.780 --> 33:06.191
- would've shot him.
- O.B.: Get in!

33:06.300 --> 33:07.790
Well, I didn't say they could prove it.

33:07.900 --> 33:09.265
- O.B.: Get up!
- But they sure did

33:09.380 --> 33:11.303
think it out loud, didn't they, Major?

33:11.420 --> 33:13.263
O.B.: Hyah! Get up, boys!

33:13.380 --> 33:16.031
But Warren's war record was stellar,

33:16.140 --> 33:18.507
and that's what saved his ass.

33:18.620 --> 33:19.781
O.B.: Hyah!

33:19.900 --> 33:21.709
Now, you killed yourself your share

33:21.820 --> 33:26.109
of redskins in your day,
didn't you, Black Major?

33:26.220 --> 33:28.222
Cavalry tends to look kindly on that.

33:28.340 --> 33:31.230
I'll tell you what the cavalry
didn't look kindly on.

33:31.340 --> 33:33.555
- O.B.: Giddyup!
- Mannix's Marauders, that's what.

33:33.656 --> 33:34.670
O.B.: Get in! Hyah!

33:34.780 --> 33:36.862
And the fact that Erskine Mannix's little boy

33:36.980 --> 33:38.869
would talk about anybody else's behavior

33:38.980 --> 33:42.382
during war time makes me want to horse-laugh.

37:04.900 --> 37:09.064
Well, whoever you are,
help O.B. with the horses.

37:09.220 --> 37:11.222
(GRUNTS) Come on.

37:11.340 --> 37:14.344
Get 'em out of this cold
'fore that blizzard hits us.

37:14.460 --> 37:16.940
Whoa. You all right?

37:17.100 --> 37:18.226
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

37:18.340 --> 37:19.387
Esperate, esperate, esperate!

37:19.500 --> 37:21.901
I just put those other horses away.

37:22.020 --> 37:25.069
You need it done fast, you need to help.

37:25.180 --> 37:27.660
I got two of my best men on it.

37:28.940 --> 37:31.227
You heard him, freeloaders.

37:31.340 --> 37:33.468
Get to work!

37:33.620 --> 37:36.100
BOB: All right, you two, unhook the leaders.

37:36.220 --> 37:37.506
Come on, let's go.

37:37.620 --> 37:39.224
JOHN: Open up!

37:39.340 --> 37:40.865
- MAN: You have to kick it open!
- MAN 2: Ya got to kick it open!

37:40.980 --> 37:41.867
DOMERGUE: What?

37:41.980 --> 37:43.470
Kick it open!

37:43.580 --> 37:45.389
- (WIND WHISTLING)
- Shut that door.

37:45.500 --> 37:46.661
There's a goddamn blizzard out there!

37:46.780 --> 37:48.145
You have to stop, close the door!

37:48.300 --> 37:49.540
You got to nail it shut.

37:49.660 --> 37:52.425
You have to, you have to nail it shut!

37:52.540 --> 37:53.905
Hold it shut!

37:54.020 --> 37:55.749
There's a hammer and nails by the door!

37:55.860 --> 37:57.271
You have to nail it shut!

37:57.380 --> 38:00.463
There's a hammer and nails by the door.

38:00.580 --> 38:02.469
- JOHN: Give me a hammer.
- DOMERGUE: Yeah.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.584
(GRUNTING)

38:11.380 --> 38:12.984
You need, you need two pieces of wood!

38:13.100 --> 38:14.829
You need two pieces of wood!
One ain't good enough!

38:14.940 --> 38:16.180
Two pieces of wood!

38:16.300 --> 38:18.667
The fuckin' thing is busted!

38:18.780 --> 38:21.511
Not just one piece of wood!

38:21.620 --> 38:25.028
- JOHN: Give me another piece of wood.
- DOMERGUE: Yeah. All right.

38:29.500 --> 38:31.104
- I need a nail.
- Here.

38:31.260 --> 38:33.467
(GRUNTING)

38:44.100 --> 38:45.670
Jesus.

38:45.780 --> 38:48.465
(PANTING)

38:48.580 --> 38:50.821
That door's a son of a gun.

38:50.940 --> 38:54.828
Who's the idiot who broke that,
that Mexican fella?

38:54.940 --> 38:56.305
Oh, good heavens.

38:56.420 --> 38:57.751
A woman?

38:57.860 --> 38:59.191
Out in this white hell?

38:59.300 --> 39:02.509
You must be frozen solid, poor thing.

39:02.620 --> 39:04.065
(JOHN GRUNTS)

39:04.180 --> 39:06.911
Looks like Minnie's got her a full house.

39:09.220 --> 39:11.348
When did you fellas arrive?

39:11.460 --> 39:12.507
Ah.

39:12.620 --> 39:14.543
About 40 minutes ago.

39:14.660 --> 39:16.424
That cowboy fella in the corner,

39:16.540 --> 39:18.463
- that your driver?
- No, no, he's a passenger.

39:18.580 --> 39:20.503
The driver lit out.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.621
Said he was going to spend the blizzard
shacked up with a friend.

39:23.740 --> 39:26.346
Lucky devil.

39:26.460 --> 39:28.588
Jesus Christ, that's awful!

39:28.700 --> 39:31.226
- (MAN CHUCKLES)
- Christ Almighty,

39:31.340 --> 39:34.344
what'd that Mexican fella do,
soak his old socks in a pot?

39:34.460 --> 39:37.066
Yes, uh... I think we all felt the same way,

39:37.180 --> 39:40.263
but were a little too polite
to say something.

39:40.380 --> 39:42.667
- He don't have that problem.
- Shit.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.464
Where's the well water?

39:44.580 --> 39:46.105
Uh, over there.

39:51.980 --> 39:55.507
So, all three of you fellas
headed to Red Rock

39:55.620 --> 39:58.385
when the blizzard stopped you, huh?

39:58.500 --> 40:01.663
Yes. All three of us were
on that stagecoach out there.

40:13.020 --> 40:15.591
(SNIFFS) Coffee beans.

40:15.740 --> 40:18.266
Uh, over there.

40:26.340 --> 40:28.547
Get your hand out of there.

40:32.540 --> 40:35.271
New sheriff of Red Rock's travelin' with us.

40:35.380 --> 40:38.270
Ah, sheriff of Red Rock, that'll be the day.

40:38.380 --> 40:41.224
He's a goddamn sheriff, I'm a monkey's uncle.

40:41.340 --> 40:42.421
Good.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.430
Then you can share bananas
with your nigger friend in the stable.

40:45.540 --> 40:47.781
So,

40:47.940 --> 40:50.147
the new sheriff of Red Rock
is traveling with you?

40:50.260 --> 40:51.591
Oh, he's lying.

40:51.700 --> 40:53.623
He ain't sheriff of nothin'.

40:53.740 --> 40:55.663
He's a Southern renegade.

40:55.820 --> 40:59.344
He's just talking hisself
out of freezing to death is all.

40:59.460 --> 41:01.428
What the fuck I tell you about talking, huh?

41:01.540 --> 41:03.065
I'll bust you in the mouth

41:03.180 --> 41:05.421
right in front of these people.
I don't give a fuck!

41:05.580 --> 41:07.105
You never gave your name, sir.

41:07.220 --> 41:09.348
John Ruth.

41:09.500 --> 41:10.581
Are you a lawman?

41:10.700 --> 41:12.065
I'm taking her to the law.

41:12.180 --> 41:13.545
So you're a bounty hunter?

41:13.660 --> 41:15.901
That's right, buster.

41:17.980 --> 41:19.709
Do you have a warrant?

41:19.820 --> 41:21.151
(SCOFFS): Yeah, course I do.

41:21.260 --> 41:22.546
May I see it?

41:25.900 --> 41:27.470
Why?

41:27.580 --> 41:30.663
Ah. You're supposed
to produce it upon request.

41:30.780 --> 41:33.511
How am I supposed to know
you're not a villain,

41:33.620 --> 41:36.021
kidnapping this woman,

41:36.140 --> 41:38.108
without a warrant in your possession?

41:40.180 --> 41:41.864
What's your name, buster?

41:41.980 --> 41:45.905
Well, it certainly isn't Buster.

41:47.180 --> 41:50.502
It's Oswaldo Mobray.

41:51.660 --> 41:53.025
Oswaldo?

41:53.140 --> 41:54.585
Yes.

41:55.780 --> 41:57.703
Well,

41:57.820 --> 42:01.108
I got my warrant, Oswaldo.

42:14.540 --> 42:15.666
I take it you're Daisy Domergue?

42:15.780 --> 42:17.384
- That's her.
- Yeah.

42:19.020 --> 42:20.624
(SOFTLY): I see.

42:22.260 --> 42:25.707
Uh, it says here "dead or alive."

42:25.820 --> 42:27.663
Yeah. It does.

42:27.780 --> 42:29.828
Well, transporting a desperate,

42:29.940 --> 42:32.341
hostile prisoner such as her

42:32.500 --> 42:34.309
sounds like hard work.

42:34.460 --> 42:37.384
Wouldn't transporting her be easier

42:37.500 --> 42:38.945
if she were dead?

42:39.060 --> 42:41.745
Well, no one said the job
was supposed to be easy.

42:41.860 --> 42:44.386
And why is her hanging proper
so important to you?

42:44.500 --> 42:46.309
Let's just say I don't like
cheatin' the hangman.

42:46.420 --> 42:48.104
He got to make a living, too.

42:48.220 --> 42:50.587
Well, I appreciate that.

42:50.700 --> 42:53.590
Allow me to properly

42:53.700 --> 42:55.589
introduce myself.

42:55.700 --> 43:00.141
I'm Oswaldo Mobray,
the hangman in these parts.

43:03.380 --> 43:05.144
(JOHN CHUCKLES)

43:05.260 --> 43:07.149
- La-di-da.
- Ah.

43:07.260 --> 43:08.750
Looks like I brought you a customer.

43:08.860 --> 43:09.986
Yeah, so it would appear.

43:10.100 --> 43:11.864
You ever spent two days or more

43:11.980 --> 43:15.063
locked up with one of your customers before?

43:15.180 --> 43:17.182
- I can't say I have.
- Don't talk to my prisoner.

43:17.300 --> 43:18.745
I talk to my prisoner, that's it.

43:18.860 --> 43:19.941
- You got it?
- I got it.

43:20.060 --> 43:21.266
(CHUCKLES) Jolly good.

43:21.380 --> 43:24.864
You got anything in here besides
coffee that can help warm us up?

43:24.980 --> 43:27.187
Well, the bar is open.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.951
Follow moi. (CHUCKLES)

43:31.620 --> 43:33.588
(WIND WHISTLING)

43:42.420 --> 43:45.424
Line, O.B.!

43:45.540 --> 43:47.190
O.B.: Oh, whoa.

43:47.300 --> 43:48.825
Oh.

43:50.580 --> 43:52.264
Whoa.

Whoa, Ace, whoa.

44:27.780 --> 44:31.023
You're all right, you're all right.

44:31.140 --> 44:32.904
CHRIS: Come on, goddamn it. I'm cold!

44:33.020 --> 44:34.988
(HORSE NEIGHING)

44:39.340 --> 44:41.468
BOB: I'll feed and water the horses.

44:41.580 --> 44:44.550
You go inside and get some hot coffee.

44:44.660 --> 44:46.150
Got some stew cooking.

44:46.300 --> 44:47.347
Should be done soon.

44:47.460 --> 44:48.700
Now, look.

44:48.820 --> 44:52.222
No matter how bad this blizzard gets,

44:52.340 --> 44:57.186
we still got to feed these horses
and take a squat from time to time.

44:57.300 --> 45:00.383
So me and Chris better lay out a line

45:00.500 --> 45:02.662
from the stable to the front door

45:02.820 --> 45:05.664
and from the front door to the shithouse.

45:05.820 --> 45:07.310
Okay?

45:10.740 --> 45:12.344
Good idea.

45:13.460 --> 45:15.110
Come on, Chris.

45:16.820 --> 45:18.265
I'll give you a hand.

45:19.820 --> 45:22.505
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Go inside. Get warm.

45:22.620 --> 45:24.463
You're doin' stable work
in a goddamn blizzard.

45:24.580 --> 45:26.309
I offer to help, you say no?

45:27.860 --> 45:29.908
You're right, amigo.

45:30.020 --> 45:31.909
Muchas gracias.

45:34.140 --> 45:35.983
O.B.: All right. Follow me.

45:36.140 --> 45:38.541
(O.B. AND CHRIS GRUNTING)

45:38.660 --> 45:41.027
(GRUNTING CONTINUES)

45:46.900 --> 45:50.586
We're gonna drop one every ten paces,

45:50.740 --> 45:52.310
- from here to the door.
- Yeah!

45:52.420 --> 45:54.229
All right!

45:58.340 --> 46:00.661
(COUGHING)

46:00.780 --> 46:02.748
(♪♪♪)

46:18.180 --> 46:20.547
(♪♪♪)

46:39.420 --> 46:41.866
(♪♪♪)

46:53.900 --> 46:57.461
Now, you're wanted for murder.

46:57.580 --> 47:01.788
For the sake of my analogy,
let's just assume that you did it.

47:01.900 --> 47:04.028
Now, John Ruth wants
to take you back to Red Rock

47:04.140 --> 47:06.063
to stand trial for murder.

47:06.180 --> 47:09.309
And if you're found guilty,

47:09.420 --> 47:13.063
the people of Red Rock
will hang you in the town square.

47:13.180 --> 47:14.989
And, as the hangman,

47:15.100 --> 47:18.309
I will perform the execution.

47:18.420 --> 47:21.026
And if all those things

47:21.140 --> 47:22.983
end up taking place,

47:23.100 --> 47:26.104
that's what civilized society

47:26.220 --> 47:29.542
calls justice.

47:29.660 --> 47:31.549
However,

47:31.660 --> 47:34.823
if the relatives and the loved ones

47:34.940 --> 47:38.390
of the person you murdered
were outside that door right now,

47:38.500 --> 47:40.821
and after busting down that door,

47:40.940 --> 47:43.386
they drug you out into the snow

47:43.500 --> 47:45.548
and hung you up by the neck,

47:45.660 --> 47:49.028
that would be frontier justice.

47:49.140 --> 47:52.064
Now, the good part

47:52.180 --> 47:53.909
about frontier justice

47:54.020 --> 47:57.661
is it's very thirst-quenching.

47:57.780 --> 48:02.229
The bad part is
it's apt to be wrong as right.

48:02.340 --> 48:03.671
Well, not in your case.

48:03.780 --> 48:05.111
In your case, you'd have it coming.

48:05.220 --> 48:08.383
But other people, maybe not so much.

48:08.500 --> 48:12.510
OSWALDO: But ultimately, what's
the real difference between the two?

48:12.620 --> 48:16.261
The real difference is me.

48:16.380 --> 48:17.870
The hangman.

48:17.980 --> 48:19.744
To me, it doesn't matter what you did.

48:19.860 --> 48:22.101
When I hang you, I'll get no
satisfaction from your death.

48:22.220 --> 48:23.301
It's my job.

48:23.420 --> 48:24.865
I hang you in Red Rock.

48:25.020 --> 48:26.704
I move on to the next town.

48:26.820 --> 48:30.666
I hang someone else there.

48:30.780 --> 48:34.910
The man who pulls the lever
that breaks your neck

48:35.020 --> 48:37.910
will be a dispassionate man.

48:38.020 --> 48:42.309
And that dispassion
is the very essence of justice.

48:42.420 --> 48:46.220
For justice delivered without dispassion

48:46.340 --> 48:50.982
is always in danger of not being justice.

48:51.100 --> 48:52.511
JOHN: Amen.

48:58.340 --> 48:59.990
(SNIFFS)

49:17.780 --> 49:19.191
JOHN: No offense, cowboy fella.

49:19.300 --> 49:22.224
Just gettin' your attention.

49:22.340 --> 49:25.742
Yeah, well... (SIGHS)

you got it.

49:27.900 --> 49:30.551

49:35.380 --> 49:37.348

Well, you like writing stories so much,

49:49.100 --> 49:51.307
why don't you tell me
the story that brings you here?

49:52.580 --> 49:54.150
Who's asking?

49:54.260 --> 49:56.149
I am. John Ruth.

49:56.260 --> 49:58.661

49:58.820 --> 50:00.982
And ain't no way I'm spending
a couple of nights

50:01.100 --> 50:03.387
under a roof with somebody
I don't know who they are,

50:03.500 --> 50:05.025
and I don't know who you are.

50:05.140 --> 50:07.108
So, who are you?

50:07.220 --> 50:09.109
Joe Gage.

50:09.220 --> 50:11.188
- What?
- That's my name.

shot General Smithers in front of everybody.

01:36:46.980 --> 01:36:49.506
But about 40 seconds before that,

01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:51.588
something equally as important happened,

01:36:51.700 --> 01:36:53.828
but not everybody saw it.

01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:56.307

01:36:56.420 --> 01:36:59.788

01:50:47.100 --> 01:50:48.704
He did.

01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.230
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

01:50:52.340 --> 01:50:55.389
Yeah, he did, didn't he?

01:50:55.500 --> 01:50:58.709
But it's the stew that's got me thinkin'.

01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:03.064
Now, how long you said Minnie been gone?

01:51:03.180 --> 01:51:04.750
A week?

01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:07.345
Si.

01:51:08.420 --> 01:51:10.070
See...

01:51:10.180 --> 01:51:13.150
my mama used to make stew,

01:51:13.260 --> 01:51:16.825
and it always tasted the same,
no matter the meat.

01:51:16.940 --> 01:51:18.863
And there was another fellow
on the plantation,

01:51:18.980 --> 01:51:20.505
Uncle Charly.

01:51:20.620 --> 01:51:22.145
He made stew, too.

01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:23.944
And like my mama,

01:51:24.060 --> 01:51:27.951
I ate his stew from the time I was a whipper

01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.461
till I was a full-grown man.

01:51:31.660 --> 01:51:33.583
No matter the meat,

01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:36.544
it always tasted like Uncle Charly's stew.

01:51:37.820 --> 01:51:41.463
Now, I ain't had Minnie's stew
in six months, so I ain't no expert.

01:51:41.580 --> 01:51:45.665
But that damn sure is...

01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:48.465
Minnie's stew.

01:51:48.580 --> 01:51:50.947
So if Minnie is on the north side

01:51:51.060 --> 01:51:53.540
visitin' her mama for a week,

01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.510
how'd she make the stew this mornin'?

01:51:56.660 --> 01:51:58.185
CHRIS: Hmm. (CHUCKLES)

(BOB SIGHS)

01:52:00.820 --> 01:52:03.710
And this...

01:52:03.820 --> 01:52:07.620
this is Sweet Dave's chair.

01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:09.788
When I sat in it earlier,

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:11.709
(CHUCKLING): I couldn't believe it.

01:52:11.820 --> 01:52:14.346
Nobody sits in Sweet Dave's chair.

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:16.701
Uh, this may be Minnie's place,

01:52:16.820 --> 01:52:20.108
but this is damn sure

01:52:20.220 --> 01:52:22.302
Sweet Dave's chair.

01:52:24.620 --> 01:52:27.783
And if he went to the north side...

01:52:29.540 --> 01:52:31.781
I'm pretty goddamn sure

01:52:31.900 --> 01:52:34.585
this chair be goin' with him.

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:41.063
What's in the chair?

01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:43.342
Just what I thought.

01:52:43.500 --> 01:52:46.470
Sweet Dave's goddamn blood.

01:52:46.580 --> 01:52:48.230
Hoo!

01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:50.064
Hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:52:52.180 --> 01:52:56.504
So, are you actually accusing me of murder?

01:52:56.620 --> 01:52:58.349
(WARREN CHUCKLES)

01:52:59.700 --> 01:53:02.670
Way I see it, Senor Bob,

01:53:02.780 --> 01:53:05.943
is whoever is workin' with her

01:53:06.060 --> 01:53:08.904
ain't who they say they is.

01:53:09.020 --> 01:53:10.863
And if it's you,

01:53:10.980 --> 01:53:13.108
that means Minnie and her man

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:15.063
ain't at her mama's.

01:53:15.180 --> 01:53:18.662
They layin' out back there dead somewhere.

01:53:18.780 --> 01:53:20.828
Or if it's you, little British man,

01:53:20.940 --> 01:53:24.149
the real Oswaldo Mobray layin'
in a ditch somewhere

01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:26.786
and you just a English fella
passin' off his papers.

01:53:26.900 --> 01:53:29.665
CHRIS: Or we go by my theory,

01:53:29.780 --> 01:53:32.704
which is the ugliest guy did it.

01:53:32.820 --> 01:53:35.391
Which makes it you, Joe Gage.

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:39.789
So I take it you deduced
the coffee was poisoned

01:53:39.900 --> 01:53:41.868
while you were murdering the old man?

01:53:43.060 --> 01:53:44.710
Yes.

01:53:44.820 --> 01:53:47.346
Well, mi negro amigo,

01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:49.622
during that whole incident,

01:53:49.740 --> 01:53:52.346
I was sitting on that side of the room

01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:54.667
playing "Silent Night" on the piano.

01:53:54.820 --> 01:53:57.824
Oh, I ain't say you poisoned the coffee.

01:53:57.940 --> 01:54:00.910
I said you didn't make the stew.

01:54:02.420 --> 01:54:05.902
My theory is...

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:09.024
you workin' with the man

01:54:09.140 --> 01:54:13.341
who poisoned the coffee,
and both of y'all murdered Minnie,

01:54:13.460 --> 01:54:16.384
Sweet Dave and whoever else
picked this bad-luck day

01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:19.344
to visit Minnie's Haberdashery this mornin'.

01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:23.226
And at some point, y'all intended

01:54:23.340 --> 01:54:25.820
to bushwhack John Ruth

01:54:25.940 --> 01:54:28.705
and free Daisy.

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:31.266
But you didn't count on the blizzard,

01:54:31.380 --> 01:54:34.429
and you didn't count on the two of us.

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.701
CHRIS: Hmm.

01:54:39.100 --> 01:54:41.068
That's far as I got. How am I doing?

01:54:41.180 --> 01:54:43.148
(CHUCKLES)

01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:47.426
You're a real imaginative nigger,

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.787
- ain't you?
- (LAUGHS)

01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:52.744
So, do you intend to murder me

01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:55.181
based on a far-fetched nigger theory,

01:54:55.340 --> 01:54:57.707
or can you prove it, cabron?

01:54:57.820 --> 01:54:59.106
(LAUGHS)

01:54:59.260 --> 01:55:04.391
It ain't so far-fetched, Senor Bob.

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:07.265
And it's a little bit more than a theory.

01:55:11.620 --> 01:55:14.191
How long you say you been workin' for Minnie?

01:55:14.300 --> 01:55:16.064
Four months.

01:55:16.180 --> 01:55:17.909
Mmm.

01:55:18.020 --> 01:55:20.705
See, if you'd have been here
two and a half years ago,

01:55:20.820 --> 01:55:24.666
you'd know 'bout that sign
used to hang up over the bar.

01:55:24.780 --> 01:55:27.226
Minnie mention that to you?

01:55:28.540 --> 01:55:30.383
No.

01:55:30.540 --> 01:55:33.305
You want to know what
that sign said, Senor Bob?

01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:39.749
"No dogs or Mexicans allowed."

01:55:39.860 --> 01:55:43.103
(CHRIS LAUGHS)

01:55:43.260 --> 01:55:46.822
Now, Minnie hung that sign up
the day she opened this haberdashery.

01:55:46.940 --> 01:55:49.910
And it hung over that bar every day

01:55:50.060 --> 01:55:53.030
till she took it down
a little over two years ago.

01:55:54.620 --> 01:55:56.384
You know why she took it down?

01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:00.786
She started lettin' in dogs.

01:56:00.900 --> 01:56:02.868
(SIGHS)

01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:08.431
Now, Minnie liked just about everybody,

01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:10.708
but she sure don't

01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:12.663
like Mexicans.

01:56:12.780 --> 01:56:14.703
So when you tell me

01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:18.381
Minnie went to the north side
to visit her mama,

01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:21.071
well, I find that highly unlikely.

01:56:21.180 --> 01:56:24.468
But okay, maybe.

01:56:24.580 --> 01:56:27.186
But when you tell me

01:56:27.300 --> 01:56:30.941
Minnie Mink took the haberdashery,

01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:35.025
the most precious thing to her
in the whole world,

01:56:35.140 --> 01:56:39.111
and left it in the hands
of a goddamn Mexican?

01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:42.230
Well, that's what I meant in the barn

01:56:42.340 --> 01:56:45.071
when I said that sure
don't sound like Minnie.

01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:50.144
Now I am calling you a liar,

01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:52.228
Senor Bob.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:55.502
And if you lyin',

01:56:55.620 --> 01:56:57.110
which you are...

01:56:58.740 --> 01:56:59.707
then you killed Minnie.

poisoned the coffee, though.

02:13:34.100 --> 02:13:35.784
If you...

02:13:35.900 --> 02:13:37.504
was a cat,

02:13:37.620 --> 02:13:40.430
what just happened here

02:13:40.540 --> 02:13:42.781
would count as one of your nine lives.

02:13:45.500 --> 02:13:48.071
Do you realize how close you came

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:50.109
to being tossed on a pile of niggers?

02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:51.745
- (CHUCKLES) Yes.
- Yeah.

02:13:51.860 --> 02:13:55.669
And when it comes to that pile
of niggers that we buildin' out back,

02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:57.669
won't take nothin' to make you general of it.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.942
You believe that?

02:14:00.060 --> 02:14:02.301
I expect no less.

02:14:02.420 --> 02:14:05.663
Not so fast, old man.

02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:07.822
You might have a way out of this yet.

02:14:11.020 --> 02:14:14.229
Later today,

02:14:14.340 --> 02:14:16.388
dirty...

02:14:16.540 --> 02:14:19.111
son of a gun

02:14:19.220 --> 02:14:21.427
is gonna come in here...

02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:27.950
and he's gonna have my sister with him.

02:14:28.060 --> 02:14:31.621
And he is gonna have her in chains.

02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:37.789
He's taking her to Red Rock to be hung.

02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:50.181
Do you know why?

02:14:50.300 --> 02:14:52.667
No.

02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:57.828

02:14:59.900 --> 02:15:03.063
That's why.

02:15:03.180 --> 02:15:05.103
Now, when he gets here,

02:15:05.220 --> 02:15:09.589
I'm gonna kill that fella
and turn my sister loose.

02:15:09.700 --> 02:15:13.591
Now, do you have any reason
why you would want to interfere

02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:16.670
with me saving my sister
from a hangman's rope?

02:15:16.780 --> 02:15:17.827
No.

02:15:17.940 --> 02:15:19.101
You don't?

02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:20.381
No, I don't.

02:15:20.500 --> 02:15:21.990
You sure you don't?

02:15:22.100 --> 02:15:25.183
I mean, we did just kill
Minnie and Sweet Dave.

02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:29.100
Now, you and Sweet Dave looked
mighty chummy over here.

02:15:29.220 --> 02:15:30.381
I just met these people!

02:15:30.500 --> 02:15:32.104
I don't give a damn about them!

02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:34.461
Or you. Or your sister.

02:15:34.620 --> 02:15:37.863
Or any other son of a bitch
in Wyoming, for that matter.

02:15:37.980 --> 02:15:41.382
That is a good answer,

02:15:41.540 --> 02:15:43.986
old man.

02:15:44.100 --> 02:15:46.262
Now, when they get here,

02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:49.424
you just sit your ass in this chair,

02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:51.702
and you don't do nothin'.

02:15:51.820 --> 02:15:53.026

02:15:57.860 --> 02:16:00.784
(STAMMERS) Maybe your name.

02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.026
But that's it.

02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:09.227
- And maybe my name.
- Maybe your name.

02:16:09.340 --> 02:16:12.389
Mm-hmm, be a, be a old man.

Be dotty.

02:16:14.020 --> 02:16:16.182
Go to sleep.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:18.951
And don't you say nothin',

02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.142
and I mean nothin',

02:16:21.260 --> 02:16:23.149
to that bounty hunter that's got my sister.

02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:24.910

Yes.

Let's get ready.

02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:32.031
Now, remember, it doesn't matter
if we have four men or 40,

02:17:32.139 --> 02:17:35.226
we are still gonna be facing
John Ruth chained to my sister

02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:36.910
with a pistol pointed at her belly.

02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:40.907
Now, killin' that fella 'fore he kills
my sister ain't gonna be easy,

02:17:41.020 --> 02:17:43.785

exactly what we gonna do.

02:17:49.740 --> 02:17:52.471
at some point he will close his eyes.

02:17:52.580 --> 02:17:55.264
And that's when you blow
the top of his head off.

02:17:55.379 --> 02:17:57.189
Remember, old man.

02:17:57.299 --> 02:17:59.950
If my sister don't make it
off of this mountain alive,

02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:01.261
neither do you.

02:18:01.379 --> 02:18:02.905

02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:46.547
I'll bite.

02:24:46.660 --> 02:24:47.991
Why?

02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:50.751
I'm working with all three of them fellas.

02:24:50.860 --> 02:24:52.828
But not 'cause they got
butterflies in their belly

02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:55.705
about me, but because we're all gang members.

02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:58.107
The Jody Domingre Gang.

02:24:58.220 --> 02:25:01.747
That fella y'all just killed in the basement

02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:03.350
was Jody Domingre!

02:25:03.460 --> 02:25:05.542
My brother!

02:25:05.660 --> 02:25:10.029
Well, who the hell is Jody Domingre?

02:25:10.140 --> 02:25:12.268
You want to tell him, bounty man?

02:25:12.380 --> 02:25:13.541
(WARREN CHUCKLES)

02:25:13.660 --> 02:25:17.551
He was a big bad cat worth $50,000.

02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:21.705
And every member of his gang
was worth at least ten.

02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:24.744
Which finally explains why you worth ten.

02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:27.181
And what's gonna happen when
that sun comes out, nigger?

02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:30.031
So is my brother's 15 men
coming straight here for us.

02:25:30.140 --> 02:25:32.029
Tell him, Grouch!

02:25:32.140 --> 02:25:34.461
Jody got 15 men waiting in Red Rock.

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:39.422
We couldn't kill John Ruth
and free Daisy here,

02:25:39.540 --> 02:25:44.068
their job was to sack the town,
kill John Ruth

02:25:44.180 --> 02:25:46.751
and free Daisy there.

02:25:46.860 --> 02:25:50.387
Now, with my brother dead,
I'm in charge of this gang.

02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:51.865
- Right, boys?
- That's right, Daisy.

02:25:51.980 --> 02:25:52.902
Oh, yeah.

02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.829
And, Chris, I am telling you,

02:25:54.940 --> 02:25:59.264
you ain't done anything yet
that we can't forgive.

02:25:59.380 --> 02:26:01.223
So, let's make a deal.

02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:02.830
No deals, bitch.

02:26:02.940 --> 02:26:05.386
You gonna let that nigger
speak for you, Chris?

02:26:05.540 --> 02:26:09.226
Hold it, Warren.

02:26:09.380 --> 02:26:12.350
Seeing as how she ain't got nothing to sell,

02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:16.465
I'm kinda curious about her sales pitch.

02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:17.786
Humor me.

02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:18.787
(WARREN GROANS)

02:26:18.900 --> 02:26:22.746
All right... bitch.

02:26:31.300 --> 02:26:36.067
What's... your... deal?

02:26:36.180 --> 02:26:38.182
Easy.

02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:42.908
Take your gun, shoot that nigger dead.

02:26:43.020 --> 02:26:46.866
Then we sit here all nice-like
for the next two days.

02:26:46.980 --> 02:26:50.143
When the snow melts, we go to
Mexico, you go on to Red Rock,

02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:52.262
get that star pinned on your chest.

02:26:52.420 --> 02:26:55.424
Hey, Pete. How much can we pay him?

02:26:55.540 --> 02:26:59.750
Well, we could give him Marco.

02:27:01.420 --> 02:27:04.947
Bob's real name is Marco the Mexican.

02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:07.546
He's worth $12,000.

02:27:07.660 --> 02:27:09.867
WARREN: That's Marco the Mexican?

02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:11.829
Precisely, yeah.

02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:13.630
(LAUGHS): Shit.

02:27:13.740 --> 02:27:17.745
Now that I blowed his face off,
Marco ain't worth a peso.

02:27:17.860 --> 02:27:19.464
(LAUGHS)

02:27:19.580 --> 02:27:20.467
(GROANS): Oh!

02:27:20.580 --> 02:27:22.150
Oh, sh... Oh, sh...

02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:25.070
PETE: Well, then, if I die
in the next two days,

02:27:25.180 --> 02:27:27.706
which is more than likely, you can have me.

02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:30.664
Under the name of English Pete Hicox,

02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:35.024
I got a federal bounty of $15,000 on my head.

02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:39.110
It's all yours, Chris.

02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:42.230
WARREN: You keep talking, Pete,

02:27:42.340 --> 02:27:46.106
you gonna talk yourself to death.

02:27:46.220 --> 02:27:49.110
Joe Gage, who you be?

02:27:49.220 --> 02:27:50.710
Grouch Douglass.

02:27:50.820 --> 02:27:52.390
(WARREN LAUGHS)

02:27:52.500 --> 02:27:53.990
You heard of him?

02:27:54.100 --> 02:27:56.421
Yeah, I heard of Grouch Douglass.

02:27:56.540 --> 02:27:59.987
He worth ten, just like Daisy.

02:28:00.100 --> 02:28:02.182
Well, remind me...

02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:07.466
why we wouldn't just kill all y'all, cash in.

02:28:07.620 --> 02:28:10.863
Oh, you can kill us all,
but you'll never spend a cent

02:28:10.980 --> 02:28:12.266
of that bounty money,

02:28:12.420 --> 02:28:14.787
and you'll never leave this mountain alive.

02:28:14.900 --> 02:28:17.221
'Cause when that snow melts,
the rest of Jody's gang,

02:28:17.380 --> 02:28:21.430
all 15 of 'em that are waiting
in Red Rock, are coming here.

02:28:21.540 --> 02:28:24.271
Now, let's say you shoot us all.

02:28:24.380 --> 02:28:27.987
If you really want all that
Domingre Gang bounty money,

02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:31.144
you still got to get
all our corpses into Red Rock.

02:28:31.260 --> 02:28:33.422
And that ain't gonna be so easy.

02:28:33.540 --> 02:28:35.781
'Cause I doubt you can drive
a four-horse team.

02:28:35.940 --> 02:28:38.750
And that wagon out there is
too heavy for a two-horse team.

02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:43.551
So that means you're gonna have to lead
a string of horses into Red Rock.

02:28:43.700 --> 02:28:45.987
And with that deep snow after a blizzard,

02:28:46.100 --> 02:28:48.387
you ain't gonna be able
to get away with any more than,

02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:50.582
say, one body per horse.

02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:56.503
So that's you leading a string
of four horses into Red Rock.

02:28:56.620 --> 02:29:00.102
And with all them horses in that snow

02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:03.224
and you all by your lonesome,
you're gonna be a mite poky.

02:29:03.340 --> 02:29:05.661
And you're gonna run smack dab
into the Domingre Gang.

02:29:05.780 --> 02:29:07.703
And again, Grouch, how many is that?

02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:09.185
JOE: 15 killers strong.

02:29:09.300 --> 02:29:14.067
And when those 15 killers come across you

02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:16.023
in possession of all our dead bodies,

02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:18.507
they ain't just gonna
kill you and that nigger!

02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:20.543
They gonna go back to Red Rock

02:29:20.660 --> 02:29:24.142
and kill every son of a bitch in that town!

02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:26.149
You really the sheriff of Red Rock?

02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:28.342
You want to save the town?

02:29:28.460 --> 02:29:30.030
Then shoot that nigger dead!

02:29:31.380 --> 02:29:33.109
(SCREAMS) Jesus Christ!

02:29:33.220 --> 02:29:34.506
WARREN: Oh, ho, ho!

02:29:34.620 --> 02:29:36.941
You believe in Jesus now, huh, bitch?

02:29:37.060 --> 02:29:39.586
Well, good, 'cause you about to meet him.

02:29:39.700 --> 02:29:40.940
(SCREAMING, PANTING)

02:29:41.060 --> 02:29:42.983
Anybody else want to make a deal? Huh?

02:29:43.100 --> 02:29:44.750
PETE: The deal still stands, Chris.

02:29:46.500 --> 02:29:49.788
You ain't done nothing we can't forgive.

02:29:49.900 --> 02:29:53.302
It's all still on that nigger.

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:56.549
You shoot him dead, take my body,

02:29:56.660 --> 02:29:59.181
- sit out in the snow with Daisy and Grou...

WARREN (DISTORTED): Mannix,

02:30:46.660 --> 02:30:50.187
give me my pistol.

02:30:51.260 --> 02:30:53.706
Give it here!

02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:00.742
Give it here!

(PETE GROANING SOFTLY)

02:31:13.940 --> 02:31:18.150
So, you were saying...

02:31:18.260 --> 02:31:22.424
we sit here, all nice and friendly like,

02:31:22.540 --> 02:31:24.269
for the next two days.

02:31:24.380 --> 02:31:27.350
Then the snow melts, you leave here,

02:31:27.460 --> 02:31:31.590
meet up with your gang,
and hightail it to Mexico.

02:31:31.740 --> 02:31:33.822
That's the deal, right?

02:31:33.940 --> 02:31:35.180
Yeah.

02:31:35.300 --> 02:31:41.103
And I get Oswaldo and Joe Gage?

02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:43.063
Yeah.

02:31:43.180 --> 02:31:45.387
But Jody's worth $50,000.
What about his body?

02:31:45.500 --> 02:31:50.108
(DISTORTED): You gonna make a deal

02:31:50.260 --> 02:31:56.347
with this diabolical bitch?

02:31:56.460 --> 02:31:58.189
I ain't saying
I'm gonna make a deal with her.

02:31:58.300 --> 02:31:59.267

02:31:59.380 --> 02:32:02.589
Calm down!

02:32:02.700 --> 02:32:05.465

DOMERGUE: You're getting greedy, reb.

02:32:07.220 --> 02:32:08.585
No deal.

02:32:08.700 --> 02:32:10.225
We're taking Jody's body back with us.

02:32:10.340 --> 02:32:11.421
He got children.

02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:20.030
So I kill Warren, and we all friends?

02:32:21.340 --> 02:32:23.183
Yeah.

02:32:34.180 --> 02:32:36.228
No deal, tramp.

they're gonna cut your nuts off!

in that town unburnt!

plumb scared right now, huh?

here's the problem, Daisy.

02:33:04.820 --> 02:33:08.666
In order for me to be scared of your threats,

02:33:08.780 --> 02:33:11.670
I got to believe in
those 15 extra gang members

02:33:11.780 --> 02:33:13.384

Joe Gage or Grouch Douglass or
whatever the fuck his name was,

02:33:29.380 --> 02:33:32.668
poisoned the coffee.

02:33:32.820 --> 02:33:37.189

and you didn't say shit!

02:33:54.260 --> 02:33:56.262
to cheat the rope
waiting for her in Red Rock,

02:34:15.420 --> 02:34:20.745

I'm looking at 'em.

02:34:20.860 --> 02:34:23.466

on this mountain, Chris.

fighting for a lost cause!

together after the war

in his command!
