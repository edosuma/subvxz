You won't lose it.

34:43.249 --> 34:45.651
Hey!
Maybe it's our lucky night.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.086
Lewis has got
a secret camera.

34:53.692 --> 34:56.562
[ Sighs ]
We're gettin' to the end.

34:56.595 --> 34:59.165
I don't think this angle's
gonna see him taking the pass
from the window.

34:59.198 --> 35:02.268
That's him.

35:02.301 --> 35:05.137
You mean that's his shoes.

35:05.171 --> 35:07.506
The security camera's for
the parking lot of the club.
Not the street.

35:07.539 --> 35:11.810
- You can't see anything.
- Sorry. Thought it might've
caught something.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.180
What were you gonna do with it?

35:14.213 --> 35:17.249
I was gonna threaten
to give it to the cops if
he didn't give me my car back.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.919
It's 3:40 a.m. I've gotta
get back to the sitter.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.589
I've got my checkbook.
Let's go get your car.

35:23.622 --> 35:26.492
Uh, look.
Sorry there's nothing there.
Annie, I want you to lock it up.

35:26.525 --> 35:28.460
Yeah, sure.

35:29.395 --> 35:32.331
Hey!

35:32.364 --> 35:35.301
Weber doesn't know
there's nothing on that tape.

35:35.334 --> 35:38.270
Probably doesn't even know
there's a security camera
in the parking lot.

35:38.304 --> 35:41.173
That's a pretty
big bluff, ladies.

35:41.207 --> 35:43.309
We hold up the tape,
tell him what's there.

35:43.342 --> 35:46.778
If he doesn't go for it,
we write him a check
and go home.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.880
He can go to the cops.
It's blackmail.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.717
Who are they gonna believe?
That guy?

35:51.750 --> 35:54.586
Or poor little ol' me?

36:00.492 --> 36:03.161
Ooh!
Hey, you're back.

36:03.195 --> 36:06.665
[ Chuckles ]
Got a little
proposition for you.

36:06.698 --> 36:09.401
Well, I... like
the sound of that.

36:09.435 --> 36:12.404
Look, we know
you took the parking pass
off the dashboard.

36:12.438 --> 36:15.207
Uh, that would be illegal.

36:15.241 --> 36:18.076
What's that?

36:18.109 --> 36:22.348
There's a security camera
in the bar parking lot.
It sees across the street.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.417
Just give me my car back,
stop harassing the girls
at the bar,

36:25.451 --> 36:28.086
- and we'll forget
all about this.
- You threatening me?

36:28.119 --> 36:32.324
That's right.
I'll go to the cops
and show them that tape.

36:32.358 --> 36:35.261
- Shall I do that?
- What are you?
Her sister?

36:35.294 --> 36:39.265
- Something like that.
- Okay. P.T.A. meeting's over.

36:39.298 --> 36:42.234
- Give me the tape.
- Give us the car.

[ Exhales ]

36:46.472 --> 36:48.874
[ Clears Throat ]

36:48.907 --> 36:52.678
You're not leaving here
with that tape.

36:52.711 --> 36:56.548
You think this is some kind
of joke? I could lose
the city contract over that.

36:56.582 --> 36:59.718
All the more reason to
give us the car.
Don't threaten me!

36:59.751 --> 37:02.788
I'll slap the damn taste
out of your mouth!

37:02.821 --> 37:05.257
- You don't want to do this.
- Tape.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.493
Give me the tape!
Get off of me!

37:09.227 --> 37:11.363
Get the hell off of me!
Get off of me!

- Okay, it's over! It's over!

37:18.837 --> 37:20.939
All right!
All right, I'm good.

37:20.972 --> 37:22.774
I'm good.
I'm fine.
Relax.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.743
Get the keys.

37:27.779 --> 37:29.648
Here.
Let's go.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.952
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Let's go before
he starts crying!

37:33.985 --> 37:36.822
This P.T.A. meeting
just kicked your ass.

Dead end.
Sit there.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.513
He's been Stockholmed.
Keep an eye on him.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.749
Where's Mack?
He didn't come back.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.251
Hezbollah's on the first floor.

38:06.284 --> 38:07.853
He's stopped breathing!

38:09.355 --> 38:10.989
His heart's stopped.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.676

Come on, Betty.

Beautiful sound.

Yes, it is.

Get it out,

He'll catch up.

Ten long blocks to the beach.

No stopping.
