00:53.845 --> 00:56.723
In honor of your marriage to Clover,

00:56.806 --> 00:59.768
we're gonna give you
the best bachelor party ever!

00:59.851 --> 01:00.977
What, what?

01:01.061 --> 01:03.813
What

01:03.897 --> 01:07.567
DJ Glitterbunz, drop me
some nasty bachelor party beats!

01:07.650 --> 01:11.738
DJ Glitterbunz gonna get freaky, y'all!

01:11.821 --> 01:14.115
B-b-b-bachelor party style!

01:19.662 --> 01:21.539
Oh, golly!

01:21.623 --> 01:24.292
I What'd I win, y'all?

01:26.628 --> 01:30.048
Puke, puke, puke, puke, puke!

01:36.304 --> 01:37.430
Sage!

01:39.599 --> 01:41.434
What's up, buddy

01:41.518 --> 01:44.646
I know, he's got that weird way
of coming out of nowhere, right?

01:44.729 --> 01:46.397
I do not!

01:46.481 --> 01:47.357
Oh.

01:47.440 --> 01:50.652
In my kingdom, the night
before the union of two souls

01:50.735 --> 01:52.403
is spent in reflection.

01:52.487 --> 01:54.864
It is a time of rebirth.

01:54.948 --> 01:56.950
No prob. Who you wanna birth?

01:57.033 --> 01:58.451
Uh, Mort is pretty small.

01:58.535 --> 02:02.455
No, the Mountain Lemur ritual
is very specific.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.998
A funeral?

02:04.082 --> 02:05.542
That's your marriage ritual?

02:05.625 --> 02:07.210
Ritual sacrifice.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.586
Now we're talkin'.

02:08.670 --> 02:10.171
The funeral is symbolic.

02:10.255 --> 02:12.882
A casting off of my old self.

02:12.966 --> 02:17.554
Dirt will cover me as grubs seek
the heat of my buried body!

02:17.637 --> 02:19.889
Hold on. You want us to bury you?

02:19.973 --> 02:22.475
He wanted us to bury him.

02:22.559 --> 02:25.728
Should we mark where we buried him
with a headstone or something?

02:25.812 --> 02:28.064
I got a whole bunch
ready to go in my stump.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.482
Hmm.

02:31.776 --> 02:33.695
Maybe we should use something heavier.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.406
I mean, we are in a jungle,
and leaves blow away, Your-- I know how leaves work, Maurice.

02:39.200 --> 02:40.285
Yeah, Maurice!

02:40.368 --> 02:42.620
No more speaky time.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.539
If we hurry, we can still hit the clubs

02:44.622 --> 02:47.041
so this bachelor party isn't a total loss.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.461
Hope the girls are having
a better time than us.

02:50.545 --> 02:52.046
Mm!  Another broadsword!

02:53.715 --> 02:55.300
Oh, you guys, you really--
you shouldn't have.

02:57.260 --> 03:00.013
That one's from me. It's used.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.099
Not sorry.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.184
Thank you, everyone. That was--

03:05.268 --> 03:09.022
You got no idea how much
I appreciate your friendship.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.233
This experience is just--it's all, uh--

03:12.317 --> 03:14.444
it's--it's so new, you know.

03:14.527 --> 03:16.279
I'm getting married.

03:16.362 --> 03:17.280
Me!

03:19.073 --> 03:21.367
Clover, warrior lem...

03:26.247 --> 03:29.709
Look how happy I am!

03:30.710 --> 03:32.337
Don't look at me!

03:32.420 --> 03:33.546
Don't look at me!

03:33.630 --> 03:37.550
Um, okay, so perhaps someone
should go after her?

03:40.762 --> 03:43.097
Oof. Knock, knock.

03:43.181 --> 03:47.101
Xixi, I'd really like to be alone.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.437
Look, I know why you're upset.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.022
You do? Oof!

03:51.105 --> 03:54.400
You're worried Sage is going
to leave you at the altar.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.569
Trust me, been there.

03:56.653 --> 03:58.613
Spring break!

03:59.989 --> 04:02.951
And those are just the ones
that I can remember.

04:03.034 --> 04:06.120
I'm not worried about Sage
leaving me at the altar.

04:06.204 --> 04:08.748
I mean, you know, I'm gonna be a queen!
Aah!

04:08.831 --> 04:10.416
I'll have my own army to command.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.710
I mean, that's really--
that is what is, um...

04:12.794 --> 04:14.254
That's important. That's...

04:15.838 --> 04:19.801
Yet all I can think about
is how much I love him!

04:19.884 --> 04:21.386
What's wrong with that?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.096
It's so girly!

04:23.179 --> 04:24.555
I hate girly!

04:24.639 --> 04:27.558
I am not girly!

04:27.642 --> 04:31.271
S

04:31.354 --> 04:34.148
No, loving someone else makes you real,

04:34.232 --> 04:38.736
not just some two-dimensional
tough girl lemur stereotype.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.863
That's pretty profound for a, uh...

04:40.947 --> 04:44.367
Former club kid with no self-esteem
and a desperate need to be adored?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.911
I have my moments. Feel better?

04:48.246 --> 04:49.580
Yeah, yeah, I do.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.499
Thanks, Xixi.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.210
I just--I want this day
to be special, you know?

04:54.294 --> 04:57.463
Just me and Sage. No surprises.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.841
Hello, sister girl.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.554
Mmm, these are so good.

05:04.637 --> 05:05.847
Sage, you up yet?

05:05.930 --> 05:08.391
Ted made scones! Mmm!

05:08.474 --> 05:10.184
Guys...

05:10.268 --> 05:12.145
where did we bury him?

05:12.228 --> 05:14.564
I told you we should've used
something heavier.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.191
Now Sage is buried alive
with no air or food.

05:17.275 --> 05:19.569
This is no time for truth and specifics.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.030
Find him!

05:22.113 --> 05:25.992
Sage! Sage! Sage!

05:26.075 --> 05:28.953
Operation Find the Buried Idiot

05:29.037 --> 05:30.371
is a bust, Your Majesty.

05:30.455 --> 05:33.166
Greatest bachelor party ever, y'all.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.709
What are we gonna tell Clover?

05:34.792 --> 05:37.628
No one is telling anyone anything!

05:37.712 --> 05:38.755
<i>Capisce</i>?

05:38.838 --> 05:40.757
I ain't going to the big house over this.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.675
I've already done my time!

05:42.759 --> 05:43.634
Whoa!

05:43.718 --> 05:46.387
Unfortunately,
that misshapen hangnail is right.

05:46.471 --> 05:47.847
We can't tell Clover.

05:47.930 --> 05:50.183
Ensign Ignorant here, Your Majesty.

05:50.266 --> 05:53.394
If we don't tell Clover, what happens
when Sage doesn't show up?

05:53.478 --> 05:57.273
Oh, Sage is going to show up.
Pancho, Butterfish, keep searching.

05:57.356 --> 06:00.318
Ted, find Clover and keep her distracted
until the ceremony

06:00.401 --> 06:01.944
so she doesn't get suspicious.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.113
Maurice, Mort, you're with me.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.115
I've got a plan.

06:06.199 --> 06:09.202
You want us to build a new version of Sage

06:09.285 --> 06:12.038
from scratch in a few hours?

06:12.121 --> 06:14.290
That is beyond--

06:14.373 --> 06:18.044
Sure, sounds like fun.

06:21.964 --> 06:25.134
Nurse Phantom, the sheet!

06:28.679 --> 06:31.724
I think it came out pretty nifty.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.267
-Hmm.

06:33.351 --> 06:36.020
There is no way Clover's gonna
be fooled by that.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.814
Little harsh, Maurice.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.566
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.027
Not when the eyes are made out of...

06:43.111 --> 06:45.363
What are his eyes made out of, anyway?

06:45.446 --> 06:48.449
Uh, the left one is a marble
I just happened to have lying around

06:48.533 --> 06:51.077
and not because I still play with marbles.

06:51.160 --> 06:55.748
And the right eye is something
I coughed up a few years ago.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.544
I think it belonged to a friend.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.754
Your Majesty, this is not going to work.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.924
Maurice, you need to speak louder
when I'm not listening to you.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.759
In case we don't find Sage,

07:06.843 --> 07:10.138
will this Frankensage ever
be able to say wedding vows?

07:10.221 --> 07:13.099
Nothing elaborate--
a simple grunt will work.

07:13.182 --> 07:16.561
I rigged a voice modulation unit
in its throat.

07:16.644 --> 07:20.064
If you would do the honors, Your Majesty,
I can calibrate it right now.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.984
Uh, yeah, I'm Sage Moondancer.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.652
Uh, chakra, chakra, chakra.

07:24.735 --> 07:27.071
Uh, the caterpillar eats
the chocolate of mercy

07:27.155 --> 07:29.740
<i>-Eats the chocolate of mercy...</i>
-So the butterfly knows...

07:29.824 --> 07:33.494
-Where its pony is.
<i>-So the butterfly knows where its pony is.</i>

07:33.578 --> 07:34.454
-Namaste.
<i>-Namaste.</i>

07:34.537 --> 07:35.538
-Namaste.
<i>-Namaste.</i>

07:35.621 --> 07:36.831
<i>Namaste.</i>

07:36.914 --> 07:38.791
I'm sold!

07:38.875 --> 07:41.794
-Hmm.
-You know, we do have some leftover parts

07:41.878 --> 07:45.840
if Clover and Frankensage
ever decide to have a child.

07:45.923 --> 07:49.552
I've always wanted to make my own baby.

07:49.635 --> 07:51.179
Nobody's making any babies!

07:51.262 --> 07:54.849
King Julien, we need to forget
this crazy idea and tell Clover the truth.

07:54.932 --> 07:56.601
Maurice is right.

07:56.684 --> 07:57.560
Thank you.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.688
Not about telling Clover the truth.
That would just be stupid.

08:00.771 --> 08:04.775
But I do think we need a real test
before Frankensage meets Clover.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.616
Uh, hey there...

08:11.699 --> 08:12.533
<i>Man-Hawk.</i>

08:12.617 --> 08:14.410
<i>Eat any good worms today?</i>

08:16.120 --> 08:18.247
<i>Namaste</i>.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.460
Okay.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.337
Looks like we have some work to do.

08:24.420 --> 08:26.506
Ugh, I don't have time for this, Crimson.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.925
Look, I'm sorry if Sage chose me over you,

08:29.008 --> 08:30.885
but, well, that's just what happened.

08:30.968 --> 08:32.970
Ha! Don't flatter yourself, Clo-Clo.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.474
If I still wanted Sage,
he'd be mine in a heartbeat.

08:36.557 --> 08:38.518
Ha! Sorry, no.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.645
Ha! Sorry, yes.

08:40.728 --> 08:42.146
-No!
-Yes.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.857
Aah! I can't believe
I'm having this conversation!

08:44.941 --> 08:46.651
I am getting married in a few hours.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.402
I'm anxious, I feel bloated,

08:48.486 --> 08:50.363
and I haven't even tried on my...

08:50.446 --> 08:52.031
dress.

08:52.114 --> 08:54.075
Oh, boy. Oh, hi, Clover.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.159
Hi, Crimson.

08:55.243 --> 08:57.912
Ted, why are you wearing my wedding dress?

08:57.995 --> 09:00.581
-I don't understand the question.
-Take it off! Now!

09:00.665 --> 09:01.832
Oh, no problem!

09:01.916 --> 09:05.586
King Julien told me to come by
and, you know, check on you.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.630
But I suppose that I could just...

09:07.713 --> 09:10.216
-Out!
-No! Oh, golly!

09:10.299 --> 09:12.927
-You should join him, Crimson.
-Yeah, uh, love to.

09:13.010 --> 09:15.221
Unfortunately, I can't.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.682
Yeah

09:17.765 --> 09:20.643
-'Cause I won't let her, baby brawler.
Grandma Rose.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.146
Wait, what are you doing here?

09:24.230 --> 09:26.357
My only granddaughter's getting married.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.946
Listen here, girls.

09:32.029 --> 09:34.865
You two are the only family
I've got left still breathing.

09:34.949 --> 09:38.119
-Regardless of your differences.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.496
Besides being sisters, differences are

09:40.580 --> 09:42.790
about the only thing
that we have in common.

09:42.873 --> 09:45.710
Crimson has never had to work
for a thing in her life,

09:45.793 --> 09:48.212
whereas I have had to work for everything.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.006
When I studied, she played.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.384
While I trained, she picked boyfriends
like flowers!

09:53.467 --> 09:55.553
And the moment I met someone
I cared about--

09:55.636 --> 09:57.972
I tried to take him from you.
-That's--

09:58.055 --> 09:59.515
Yeah, you did.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.684
You're right, Clo-Clo, about all of it.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.519
I've never worked as hard as you.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.605
Never had your ambition.

10:05.688 --> 10:08.357
Maybe it's because I was
the beautiful one.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.692
We're identical twins.

10:09.775 --> 10:13.863
Or maybe it's because
I was jealous of you.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.072
You?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.450
Jealous of me

10:17.533 --> 10:18.534
Please.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.161
Oh, it's not so crazy, Clo-Clo.

10:20.244 --> 10:23.623
Sure, as the pretty one,
I was Mom and Dad's favorite.

10:23.706 --> 10:25.499
Again, identical twins.

10:25.583 --> 10:28.127
But you were the one
they were always proud of.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.713
So I did the only thing I could.

10:30.796 --> 10:32.298
I became...

10:32.381 --> 10:34.300
a fabulous train wreck. No, you're not a...

10:36.385 --> 10:38.763
Okay, yeah, yeah, you're a train wreck.

10:38.846 --> 10:41.849
And trying to marry Sage,
that was

10:41.932 --> 10:44.852
My way of proving I could
finally beat you at something.

10:44.935 --> 10:49.106
But, like always, you beat me in the end.

10:49.190 --> 10:50.816
Congratulations, sister girl.

10:50.900 --> 10:54.195
I'm--I'm glad you won.

10:54.278 --> 10:57.198
Are we done? Fantastic.

10:57.281 --> 10:58.783
Crimson!

10:58.866 --> 11:01.661
Before you go, uh, just one last question.

11:01.744 --> 11:03.871
Would you like to walk me down the aisle?

11:06.499 --> 11:09.001
Xixi here,
reporting from the royal wedding of King Sage and our own Clover.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.715
I haven't seen a lot of these faces
in multiple seasons.

11:14.799 --> 11:17.510
Oh, it's Dingbert and Ringo, the snails.

11:17.593 --> 11:20.388
Oh, guys, um, who are you wearing?

11:20.471 --> 11:21.806
That wasn't funny.

11:21.889 --> 11:24.225
There could be French people here.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.520
Oh, isn't it all so lovely?

11:27.603 --> 11:30.481
Ugh, ermagurd, Dad,
how could you say that?

11:30.564 --> 11:32.066
This should be my wedding.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.068
I hate you!

11:35.277 --> 11:37.530
Oh, where is Butterfish?

11:37.613 --> 11:41.325
Don't worry, Mommy, I'll be with you.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.494
Oh, you bet you will, Todd.

11:43.577 --> 11:46.163
Mommy's baby can never leave.

11:46.247 --> 11:48.207
Never, ever.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.464
What is going on, Timo?
We're running out of time.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.133
I'm sure Doctor S is just putting

11:57.216 --> 12:00.177
the finishing touches
on Frankensage as we speak.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.513
Nurse Phantom, get the saw!

12:05.057 --> 12:07.226
Butterfish, Pancho, you're back.

12:07.309 --> 12:10.104
Please tell me you found Sage.

12:10.187 --> 12:12.648
Uh, yeah, how best to put this?

12:12.731 --> 12:13.566
Nope.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.527
Hey, is that them crab cakes
on the buffet table over there?

12:16.610 --> 12:18.362
Nothing

12:18.446 --> 12:19.447
Oh, yeah!

12:19.530 --> 12:21.490
I dug a bunch of holes.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.327
Unfortunately, I was working
with someone whose work ethic

12:25.411 --> 12:27.371
was a disgrace!

12:27.455 --> 12:29.582
It's hard to believe our son, married.

12:29.665 --> 12:32.543
And to that mongrel-blooded Clover
of all people.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.838
Oh, Barty, she's marrying
some recently kinged

12:35.921 --> 12:39.091
unwashed barbarian named Sage.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.342
Then why are we here?

12:40.426 --> 12:42.595
Well, I assume an appearance fee.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.929
Good fun!

12:44.013 --> 12:48.184
So after this, we go to your castle,
my little love ham?

12:48.267 --> 12:51.187
I don't really have a castle,
but I'm working on it,

12:51.270 --> 12:52.771
my beautiful behemoth.

12:52.855 --> 12:55.149
Until castle built,

12:55.232 --> 12:58.986
you can make home in Zora armpit pouch.

12:59.069 --> 13:01.405
I just disinfect.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.450
You read my mind.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.869
<i>Timo, did you bring</i>
<i>my inflatable doughnut?</i>

13:06.952 --> 13:10.498
<i>-You know how my sciatica acts up.</i>

13:10.581 --> 13:14.001
Ted, we may need
to stall Clover for a little--wha!

13:14.084 --> 13:16.378
Oof! Clover, you're, uh...

13:16.462 --> 13:17.588
Wow.

13:17.671 --> 13:18.672
You look amazing.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
Oh.  Thank you.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.218
Actually, I hate it, but...

13:22.301 --> 13:23.886
I convinced her to play along.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.304
Ah, Crimson!

13:25.387 --> 13:26.889
Clover, get behind me.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.683
Actually, you're still
Captain of the Ringtail Guard

13:29.767 --> 13:30.768
for a few more hours.

13:30.851 --> 13:33.854
Take her out!

13:33.938 --> 13:36.315
If you two need to delay, uh, the wedding

13:36.398 --> 13:38.442
for some death match sort of thing

13:38.526 --> 13:39.944
over who gets Sage,

13:40.027 --> 13:42.821
I can still get my deposit back
from the caterer, you know.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.907
-No need, Your Majesty.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.910
Crimson is actually gonna
walk me down the aisle.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.328
Were you looking for Ted?

13:49.411 --> 13:51.038
Ted

13:51.121 --> 13:54.041
Okay, well, then I'm gonna go back
and finish gettin' ready.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.710
You two play nice. Aah!

13:57.336 --> 14:00.172
I never wanted to hurt you, Shmoopey Bear.

14:01.549 --> 14:06.095
-S-s-stop that.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.680
-I know you feel it.

14:07.763 --> 14:10.516
-I-I do feel something.

14:10.599 --> 14:12.977
Yeah, it was just gas.

14:13.060 --> 14:14.979
-See ya, Crimson.
-Hmph!

14:15.062 --> 14:17.147
I'll get him eventually.

14:19.275 --> 14:21.318
Oh, this is so exciting!

14:21.402 --> 14:22.987
Do you know this is the first time

14:23.070 --> 14:25.656
I've ever been hired
to officiate a wedding?

14:25.739 --> 14:27.366
-Ow!

14:27.449 --> 14:30.119
I'm officiating. That's my thing.

14:30.202 --> 14:31.745
It is? Well, then why would...

14:31.829 --> 14:34.206
Oh, darn that banana!

14:34.290 --> 14:35.916
Banana, where are you?

14:38.627 --> 14:40.671
Your Majesty, we can't wait any longer.

14:40.754 --> 14:42.923
We only rented out the clearing
until three.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.175
It's okay. We still got time.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.220
Clover won't walk down that aisle
until she hears music,

14:48.304 --> 14:50.014
and I specifically told the rats...

14:50.097 --> 14:52.057
-...not to begin playing

14:52.141 --> 14:54.476
until I told them to!

14:54.560 --> 14:56.228
No, no, no!

14:56.312 --> 14:59.815
King Joey, I specifically told you
not to start until I told you to!

14:59.899 --> 15:00.941
You did?

15:01.025 --> 15:03.485
Oh, gee, I'm sorry, King Julien.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.820
Stupid! Stupid!

15:04.904 --> 15:07.531
Stupid! Stupid!

15:07.615 --> 15:11.660
Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Stupid!

15:11.744 --> 15:13.370
Mm-hmm.

15:13.454 --> 15:16.165
Ah, ah, oh, no! No, no, no!

15:16.248 --> 15:17.875
Clover, what are you doing?

15:17.958 --> 15:20.920
You shouldn't be on your feet.
Not in your condition.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.089
Uh, what

15:24.173 --> 15:27.301
Why don't we get you
back to your hut, huh?

15:27.384 --> 15:30.054
I'm sure there's some more, uh, fabric

15:30.137 --> 15:31.847
we can stitch onto your dress, hmm

15:33.724 --> 15:36.435
I haven't seen him since you lot left
for his bachelor party yesterday.

15:41.982 --> 15:44.068
I gotta go!

15:44.777 --> 15:45.945
-Almost.

15:46.028 --> 15:48.238
Doctor S is just making
some last-minute adjustments.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.823
-Whew!
-You need to go out there

15:49.907 --> 15:51.241
and stall, King Julien.

15:51.325 --> 15:53.285
Or you could just tell Clover the truth.

15:53.369 --> 15:56.664
Oh, Maurice, you are so naïve!

15:56.747 --> 15:59.583
No woman wants to hear the truth
on her wedding day.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.627
Lemurs and guests...

16:01.710 --> 16:04.713
-we are gathered here today--

16:04.797 --> 16:06.340
Mm. I just thought--

16:06.423 --> 16:08.342
Well, that's your problem right there.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.136
Ba-dum-bum.
Where's a rimshot when you need one?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.930
Am I right, people

16:15.307 --> 16:18.060
Seriously though, before the groom, Sage, comes bounding up here full of life,

16:20.980 --> 16:23.440
I just wanted to say a few words.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.943
Follow spot, please?

16:26.026 --> 16:28.570
It's the middle of the day,
Your Majesty.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.530
I knew that.

16:29.613 --> 16:32.783
Anyhoo, I look out in this audience today,

16:32.866 --> 16:34.535
and you know what I see?

16:35.911 --> 16:37.621
I see a lot of memories.

16:37.705 --> 16:39.999
Some good, some bad.

16:40.082 --> 16:42.042
What the heck, man?

16:42.126 --> 16:44.878
Not gonna lie, when I first became king,

16:44.962 --> 16:47.256
I had my doubts I could pull it off.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.341
You are not the only one.

16:49.425 --> 16:54.263
Over time, I realized
that as long as I had my peoples,

16:54.346 --> 16:56.473
I could never fail.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.267
We did this together, you guys.

16:58.350 --> 17:00.769
I truly believe that someday,

17:00.853 --> 17:02.855
we are going to look back on this

17:02.938 --> 17:05.816
as the greatest time of our lives.

17:05.899 --> 17:08.736
Which brings me to--to you, Clover.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.530
Today I have to say good-bye to you,

17:11.613 --> 17:17.327
and I'll be honest,
that makes me really sad, man.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.079
I mean, despite your rage issues

17:19.163 --> 17:21.206
and your constant need for praise.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.709
Well, that's not--I mean, I'm--
I don't need praise.

17:23.792 --> 17:27.004
You were always there
to pick up the pieces

17:27.087 --> 17:29.298
when Maurice screwed up.

17:29.381 --> 17:31.842
I don't have a lot of friends
that I can trust.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.053
I'm a pretty private guy right here.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.264
But you made it
into the inner circle, Clover.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.477
If I could have had a really...

17:41.560 --> 17:44.396
just violent sister,
I would have wanted you.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.066
-Aw.
-When you came into my life...

17:47.149 --> 17:49.860
is when I finally started down the path

17:49.943 --> 17:52.863
to becoming the lemur I am today.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.990
I love you, Clover.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.201
Thank you for letting me have the honor

17:57.284 --> 17:59.745
of being your king and friend.

17:59.828 --> 18:02.748
Oh! Oh, Your Majesty, that's...

18:06.293 --> 18:07.127
Oh!

18:13.801 --> 18:15.344
Oh, my!

18:15.427 --> 18:16.845
Owie!

18:19.765 --> 18:21.725
But enough of these buzzkill emotions,

18:21.809 --> 18:24.144
because the groom has arrived!

18:24.228 --> 18:26.063
Rats, music!

18:29.149 --> 18:30.818
♪ ♪

18:32.569 --> 18:33.570
Hmm...

18:33.654 --> 18:34.863
<i>Clover...</i>

18:34.947 --> 18:36.949
Clover, you are...

18:37.032 --> 18:38.784
<i>You look so pretty.</i>

18:38.867 --> 18:40.828
-Um...
<i>-Clover...</i>

18:40.911 --> 18:43.705
-Sure. Probably just a little tired.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.875
We got pretty crazy last night.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.127
But I wouldn't worry.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.046
You know Sage. If anyone can rally...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.464
<i>I think...</i>

18:55.092 --> 18:56.802
Uh...

18:56.885 --> 18:58.804
This is not what it looks like.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.430
Isn't what it looks like?

19:00.514 --> 19:02.391
My future husband just exploded!

19:02.474 --> 19:05.686
Sage! Oh, Sage, what happened?

19:05.769 --> 19:07.437
Why does he have wheels on his feet?

19:07.521 --> 19:08.730
Yeah, weird, huh?

19:08.814 --> 19:12.901
Guess you never really know someone
until they explode. Ow!

19:12.985 --> 19:14.653
What did you do?

19:17.489 --> 19:19.658
-We lost him.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.703
Really?

19:22.786 --> 19:24.580
I'm so sorry, Clover.

19:24.663 --> 19:27.291
He told us we had to bury him.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.292
What?

19:28.375 --> 19:30.544
It was some weird Mountain Lemur ritual.

19:30.627 --> 19:32.087
Maurice forgot...

19:32.171 --> 19:33.589
<i>Oy vey</i>.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.134
No, I forgot where we buried him.

19:37.217 --> 19:41.054
We were hoping we could build you
a new Sage and you wouldn't notice.

19:41.138 --> 19:44.016
Wouldn't notice?
He's a smoldering pile of ash!

19:44.099 --> 19:45.475
Yes, that's my bad.

19:45.559 --> 19:47.811
I replaced some of his internal organs

19:47.895 --> 19:49.646
with dynamite.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.565
Why would you do that?

19:53.692 --> 19:55.819
Oh, Sage, what have they done to you?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.865
Oh, now we have a spot!

20:03.076 --> 20:05.746
Wait, I know that crying.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.624
Sage!

20:08.707 --> 20:10.626
Jarsh-Jarsh.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.920
You're alive

20:13.003 --> 20:14.630
And why are you crying?

20:14.713 --> 20:17.549
The ceremony--it was so beautiful.

20:17.633 --> 20:22.471
I only hope my marriage
will be as beautiful as this one.

20:22.554 --> 20:25.974
What do you mean, "my marriage"?
This <i>is</i> your marriage.

20:28.268 --> 20:29.728
Oh.

20:29.811 --> 20:31.438
Cool.

20:31.521 --> 20:33.357
I thought I'd lost you.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.274
Sorry.

20:34.358 --> 20:37.778
I got bored of being reborn,
so I dug myself out of my grave.

20:37.861 --> 20:41.156
I was gonna come find you guys,
but then I had to pick up Jarsh-Jarsh

20:41.240 --> 20:44.117
'cause he still hasn't learned
to drive his own hawk.

20:44.201 --> 20:45.661
Enough!

20:45.744 --> 20:47.287
I'm just glad you're okay.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.583
I now pronounce you

20:51.667 --> 20:54.461
King and Queen of the Mountain Lemurs.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.508
Aw, man!

20:59.591 --> 21:01.093
You may...

21:01.176 --> 21:02.886
keep doing what you're doing.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.306
Clover and Sage are hitched,
you sni-sni-snitches.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.809
Let's make some n-n-n-n-n-n-noise!

21:14.856 --> 21:16.525
Get as much as you can.

21:16.608 --> 21:19.027
We can make a fortune
selling this stuff to the foosa.

21:19.111 --> 21:20.654
Has anyone seen Dorothy?

21:20.737 --> 21:23.156
Dorothy

21:23.240 --> 21:25.325
Uh, hello, my wife.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.786
You don't have a wife, Ted.

21:27.869 --> 21:31.915
You've been Madagascar's
most eligible bachelor for years.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.833
What?

21:32.916 --> 21:36.003
Do you mean to tell me Dorothy
was a figment of my imagination?

21:36.086 --> 21:37.087
Like Snake?

21:37.170 --> 21:39.756
Does this mean I'm not really married?

21:42.175 --> 21:44.845
Oh, Ted, don't pay any attention to them.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.555
Of course I'm real.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.723
You are?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.808
Oh, well, okay, then.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.402
Well, I hope it lasts longer
than my 12 marriages.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.904
Course, most of my wives died of old age.

22:04.448 --> 22:07.534
Gonna be strange not having
the whole gang together anymore.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.577
Yeah.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.038
But you know what I love
about our lives, Mo

22:11.121 --> 22:14.249
Something big, and I'm talking huge,

22:14.333 --> 22:17.669
could be just right around the corner.

22:17.753 --> 22:20.172
King Julien was right, kids.

22:20.255 --> 22:23.216
Something big was just around the corner.

22:23.300 --> 22:28.722
But that's an adventure for another...

22:31.058 --> 22:32.517
