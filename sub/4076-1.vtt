01:05.065 --> 01:08.057
I know, Soren.
You don't have to say it.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.333
We're behind schedule,
Your Majesty.

01:11.404 --> 01:13.099
I need your signature
on these,

01:13.173 --> 01:16.336
there are some RSVPs
you need to accept or decline,

01:16.409 --> 01:19.344
and I'm a little concerned
about the calendar on your return.

01:19.412 --> 01:20.606
Soren...

01:21.815 --> 01:23.214
where is the queen?

01:23.283 --> 01:26.116
Conveniently, she too
is behind schedule.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.850
Move the interview to noon.
I visit the orphanage at nine...

01:29.923 --> 01:33.359
I'm not changing that...
and I'll be back on Monday.

01:33.426 --> 01:35.656
Still no word
from Copenhagen Hospital?

01:50.310 --> 01:51.368
Queen Paige.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.803
King Edvard.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.075
I feel as if
I haven't seen you in ages.

01:56.149 --> 01:57.707
You haven't.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.718
You've been a very busy king.

02:00.386 --> 02:02.047
And a terrible husband,

02:02.122 --> 02:04.454
making you wait this long
for your honeymoon.

02:04.524 --> 02:05.718
I should be ashamed.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.123
You should.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.785
I am.

02:08.862 --> 02:10.989
Couldn't get government
to shut down for me.

02:12.332 --> 02:14.766
Then what good is it being king?

02:15.835 --> 02:16.995
Precisely.

02:21.941 --> 02:23.875
Pardon the interruption,
Your Majesties,

02:23.943 --> 02:26.275
but if you do intend
to go on your honeymoon,

02:26.346 --> 02:28.644
you might want
to catch your plane.

03:18.398 --> 03:21.663
I don't think I've ever had
a Christmas without snow.

03:21.734 --> 03:23.224
I think I'm going to miss it.

03:25.471 --> 03:27.530
What, on a secluded island?

03:27.607 --> 03:30.633
Ohh!
Eddie, I can't wait. Really.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.703
It's just different. I've...
I've always had a white Christmas.

03:34.781 --> 03:37.545
But the island's going to be great,
as long as I'm with you.

03:42.555 --> 03:43.681
Personally...

03:43.756 --> 03:45.223
I don't like the sun.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.720
I'm fair, you see.

03:50.129 --> 03:53.098
Yes, we see, Soren.
Thank you.

04:20.326 --> 04:21.850
Oh, dear.

04:23.296 --> 04:24.820
Is that the prime minister?

04:30.770 --> 04:31.862
What is he doing here?

04:31.938 --> 04:34.372
Taking advantage
of a photo opportunity.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.237
Probably wants
to come along.

04:38.478 --> 04:41.140
Queen Paige, give us a smile.

04:41.214 --> 04:43.705
- Your Majesty.
- John. How was your trip?

04:43.783 --> 04:45.307
Exhilarating, Your Majesty.

04:45.385 --> 04:46.716
Where did you go?

04:46.786 --> 04:49.949
- On a tour of the north country.
- Sounds lovely.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.787
But I'm delaying you. I only wanted
to wish you well on your honeymoon,

04:52.859 --> 04:57.421
and to present my queen
with an early Christmas gift.

04:57.497 --> 04:59.897
Oh, that's very sweet.
What is it?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.298
It's a little guide to royal protocol:

05:02.368 --> 05:05.303
tips, notes, suggestions.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.935
Thought I was doing pretty good
for a farm girl from Wisconsin.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.637
I think the queen is doing
a wonderful job.

05:12.712 --> 05:16.478
Yes, well, we all have room
for improvement, don't we?

05:16.549 --> 05:20.747
Goodness knows your schedule
will be busy enough when you get back.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.254
I'm hoping to start
at Copenhagen Hospital.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.086
Oh.

05:25.158 --> 05:29.117
I just assumed that your medical career
would be put on hold.

05:29.195 --> 05:32.756
Being queen is not
a part-time position.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.926
Well, it's lucky for us, then,
that the queen is so talented

05:36.002 --> 05:37.629
and versatile.

05:37.704 --> 05:40.002
Mm, we are lucky.

05:40.073 --> 05:42.667
Well, Your Majesties.

05:45.545 --> 05:47.445
If I may, Your Majesty,

05:47.513 --> 05:49.174
at no point in the last six months

05:49.248 --> 05:51.773
did I believe
you would benefit from a...

05:51.851 --> 05:54.115
"how to be a queen" manual.

05:54.187 --> 05:55.347
Thank you, Soren.

05:56.756 --> 05:57.814
Your Majesty!

05:57.890 --> 06:00.620
Your Majesty, how did you choose
the Caribbean for your honeymoon?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.888
Will you be making
any other stops, Your Majesty?

06:04.197 --> 06:05.960
Soren, who else knows
where we're going?

06:06.032 --> 06:07.397
Apart from everyone?

06:07.467 --> 06:10.698
I'm afraid the royal honeymoon
is rather big news.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.629
What is it, Paige?

06:13.706 --> 06:14.866
Eddie...

06:16.042 --> 06:17.907
I just want to be alone with you.

06:21.714 --> 06:23.409
Then I have an idea.

06:23.483 --> 06:24.643
Soren.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.990
Well, but, sir, what about
all my arrangements?

06:33.059 --> 06:36.051
- Eddie?
- Shh. Surprise.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.064
Very well, sir.

06:43.102 --> 06:44.433
I'll alert the pilot.

06:47.673 --> 06:50.733
Of course I got the monarch
to sign it. He had no choice.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.340
The royal couple
suspects nothing.

06:55.415 --> 06:58.179
<i>They're off on their honeymoon,</i>
<i>and by the time they return,</i>

06:58.251 --> 06:59.684
<i>it will be too late.</i>

06:59.752 --> 07:00.912
Good.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.012
The equipment
is already arriving.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.522
When you give the word,

07:04.590 --> 07:07.423
my men will be ready
to take it all down.

07:07.493 --> 07:09.586
<i>Excellent.</i>

07:12.365 --> 07:13.525
Hello.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.127
Shoo!

07:16.769 --> 07:17.861
Shoo!

07:28.781 --> 07:32.808
It's a small gem of a country,
buried in the mountains,

07:32.885 --> 07:36.821
under the protection of the Crown
for 350 years now.

07:36.889 --> 07:41.883
A little behind the times,
but beautiful, remote, as you can see.

07:42.895 --> 07:45.329
I haven't been here since I was young.

07:45.398 --> 07:47.559
Oh, it looks perfect.
I can't wait!

07:59.512 --> 08:00.979
Belavia.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.413
Oh, Eddie!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.349
It's beautiful!

08:21.734 --> 08:24.464
Well, it's, uh... desolate.

08:24.537 --> 08:25.834
Secluded.

08:25.905 --> 08:29.272
Hmm. Perhaps we should have
landed at the main airport,

08:29.342 --> 08:32.038
or at least arranged a... car.

08:33.111 --> 08:34.669
I like the adventure of it all.

08:34.746 --> 08:37.010
Do you know this is
the first time in years

08:37.082 --> 08:38.482
that I've arrived somewhere

08:38.551 --> 08:41.645
and wasn't greeted
by a parade or a band...

08:41.721 --> 08:43.655
not counting Wisconsin,
of course.

08:43.722 --> 08:44.712
How does it feel?

08:45.892 --> 08:47.052
Well, kind of...

08:48.227 --> 08:49.387
liberating.

08:49.462 --> 08:50.724
No paparazzi.

08:50.796 --> 08:52.991
No politicians.

08:53.065 --> 08:54.692
No one to see me do this!

08:56.202 --> 08:58.693
No one to hear me do this!

08:58.771 --> 09:00.705
Hello, Belavia!

09:02.275 --> 09:04.539
Except for the pilot,

09:04.610 --> 09:07.238
about whom I completely forgot.

09:11.083 --> 09:12.846
Oh, Queen Paige,

09:12.919 --> 09:14.352
you've done it now.

09:32.271 --> 09:36.264
So, tell me again
why we sent that plane back.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.536
No luck?

09:37.610 --> 09:41.046
Well, they're all gone in there.
Early Christmas vacation, I guess.

09:41.113 --> 09:44.446
And this... is useless.

09:45.751 --> 09:46.911
Someone will be along.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.511
We could literally
freeze to death before then.

09:50.623 --> 09:54.457
Speaking of which, I'm not sure we've
brought the right attire for Belavia.

09:54.527 --> 09:56.961
Those new bikinis of yours,
for instance.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.922
Did you know that
no one will shake my hand

10:01.000 --> 10:02.763
unless I extend it first?

10:02.835 --> 10:04.860
I don't know why you're
reading that thing.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.370
Just learning how to be a queen.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.339
Complicated stuff.

10:08.407 --> 10:11.069
Look. Look! We're rescued.

10:11.143 --> 10:12.542
You must be joking.

10:13.713 --> 10:15.112
You're not joking.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.475
Okay.

10:27.493 --> 10:28.653
Hello.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.525
Are you going into town?

10:33.132 --> 10:35.760
I don't think he speaks English.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.132
Hello!

10:38.337 --> 10:42.273
Hotel? Belavia... you take us?

10:42.341 --> 10:44.901
Yes.

10:49.348 --> 10:52.943
Don't look so pleased
with yourself, Miss Translator.

10:53.019 --> 10:54.509
What'll we do about the bags?

10:54.587 --> 10:58.580
Uh, the bags...
can you take the bags?

11:09.001 --> 11:13.028
Okay.

11:13.105 --> 11:15.665
Okay, okay.
He seems to think it's okay.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.106
Yeah, well, I got that part.

11:17.176 --> 11:19.542
I suppose we could send someone
for them when we get to the hotel.

11:30.690 --> 11:31.850
Um...

11:33.359 --> 11:36.260
Could we, uh... slow down a bit?

11:39.632 --> 11:41.566
What's the international sign for

11:41.634 --> 11:44.967
"Please don't kill us
in your small, brown cart?"

11:45.037 --> 11:47.369
Eddie, look,
there's a wild goat.

11:50.643 --> 11:52.406
We must be near
the nature preserve.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.571
Ho!

12:29.415 --> 12:30.905
Ho!

12:32.418 --> 12:33.544
Thank you.

12:33.619 --> 12:34.779
This is great!

12:34.854 --> 12:36.719
That was, uh...

12:36.789 --> 12:37.949
Goodbye!

12:38.023 --> 12:39.581
That was... that was fun.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.787
Bye-bye.

12:41.861 --> 12:45.262
Brrr!

12:50.336 --> 12:53.237
- Oh, wow, this is nice.
- Great!

12:53.305 --> 12:54.772
Look at all the decorations.

12:57.143 --> 12:58.303
Hello?

13:00.312 --> 13:01.472
Hey.

13:03.649 --> 13:04.809
That...

13:04.884 --> 13:07.444
is my great-great-great...

13:07.520 --> 13:10.080
great-grandfather.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.751
He was the one who put Belavia
under the protection of the Crown.

13:13.826 --> 13:18.627
And that is the Belavian monarch,
Prince Georgiev.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.633
I'm sorry. You startled me.

13:25.704 --> 13:28.264
Oh, English!
I think you give me heart attack!

13:28.340 --> 13:30.501
I'm sorry. We were just
looking at the portrait.

13:30.576 --> 13:31.975
And you yell in my ear.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.306
I know.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.812
I mean, I'm sorry.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.042
Do I know you?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.140
Um...

13:41.153 --> 13:42.780
Uh... I don't believe so.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.846
We actually
just need a room.

13:45.858 --> 13:47.689
Yes, I do.

13:47.760 --> 13:48.988
I know you.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.529
Oh, my king and queen!

14:01.607 --> 14:04.007
I'm sorry I did not recognize you.

14:04.076 --> 14:06.806
And I said I'm having a heart attack!

14:06.879 --> 14:08.471
I'm feeling much better now.

14:08.547 --> 14:11.038
How could I not know
you are gracing my hotel?

14:11.116 --> 14:12.481
Nobody knows.

14:12.551 --> 14:15.145
Yeah, our being here
is a bit of a secret.

14:15.221 --> 14:17.212
Just avoiding the paparazzi,
you understand.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.450
- Ah. Nosy people.
- Yes.

14:19.525 --> 14:21.959
Marcellus understands.
You have come to the right place.

14:22.027 --> 14:23.654
No one will bother you here.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.664
So, what can Marcellus do
for his king and queen?

14:26.732 --> 14:28.461
Well, actually, there is one thing.

14:28.534 --> 14:32.527
We had to leave our bags
at the side of the road by the airport.

14:32.605 --> 14:35.301
- Airstrip.
- Right. Airstrip.

14:35.374 --> 14:37.399
See, there wasn't
enough room in the cart.

14:37.476 --> 14:39.842
You leave your bags
on the road?

14:39.912 --> 14:41.937
On the side of the road.

14:42.014 --> 14:45.006
Yes, seemed like
a really good idea at the time.

14:45.084 --> 14:47.279
Do not worry.
I will send someone for them.

14:47.353 --> 14:50.845
If the wild dogs or bears did not get
to them, everything will be fine.

14:50.923 --> 14:52.618
Wild dogs?

14:53.392 --> 14:54.586
Sorry, bears?

14:55.628 --> 14:57.926
And it's your honeymoon!

14:58.831 --> 15:00.298
How romantic!

15:00.366 --> 15:02.163
I read all about it
in the magazines.

15:02.234 --> 15:06.364
Now, I'll put you in the best room
in all of Belavia.

15:06.438 --> 15:09.134
Come, follow me.
We have many facilities.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.835
We have restaurant.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.502
We have skis.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.068
We have snowmobiles.

15:14.146 --> 15:16.341
Um... what
was this about the bears?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.246
Is that just a rumor, or?

15:18.317 --> 15:19.648
Oh, dear.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.250
Our honeymoon suite.

15:26.825 --> 15:27.849
Wow.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.155
Nice, yes?

15:29.228 --> 15:32.254
Yes, yes.
It's, um... really...

15:32.331 --> 15:35.061
There's certainly a lot of...

15:35.134 --> 15:36.226
nature.

15:36.302 --> 15:38.896
Yes. Belavia is full of nature.

15:39.972 --> 15:41.701
It's our national treasure.

15:45.411 --> 15:46.844
And now for you,

15:46.912 --> 15:49.574
our local specialty...

15:49.648 --> 15:51.013
Brekikka.

15:51.083 --> 15:53.051
Ah.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.244
Thank you.

15:56.255 --> 15:58.280
Thank you. It's very kind.

15:58.357 --> 15:59.551
You're welcome.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.922
I leave you now.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.459
Strong.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.299
Sweet.

16:18.277 --> 16:20.142
Uh, I forgot to say...

16:22.381 --> 16:25.316
Thank you, King and Queen,
for staying at my hotel.

16:25.384 --> 16:26.817
You're welcome.

16:38.731 --> 16:41.700
What do you mean,
they're in Belavia?

16:41.767 --> 16:42.927
How could this be?

16:43.002 --> 16:45.493
I've been trying
to reach you for hours!

16:45.571 --> 16:49.337
I saw them with my very own
eyes at my very own hotel!

16:49.408 --> 16:52.309
But they're supposed
to be on an island!

16:52.378 --> 16:54.778
<i>I guess they</i>
<i>changed their minds.</i>

16:54.847 --> 16:56.678
<i>They must know something!</i>

16:56.749 --> 16:58.842
- But how could they?
- Well, how could they?

16:58.917 --> 17:02.580
<i>Ohh! I deeply,</i>
<i>deeply dislike them.</i>

17:02.654 --> 17:05.521
I am, on the whole, displeased.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.252
Oh, I too, sir.

17:07.326 --> 17:09.624
I'm displeased to my very soul.

17:09.694 --> 17:11.026
Well, what can they do?

17:11.096 --> 17:12.358
Nothing.

17:12.431 --> 17:13.557
Nothing?

17:14.665 --> 17:17.294
I have the prince's signature.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.929
<i>I'm going to call an emergency</i>
<i>session of Parliament.</i>

17:20.005 --> 17:23.031
They will clearly see
the value of these oil reserves.

17:23.108 --> 17:25.440
Um... with all due respect, sir,

17:25.511 --> 17:28.844
you're talking about our dashing
young king and his charming bride,

17:28.914 --> 17:30.472
<i>the same beautiful couple</i>

17:30.549 --> 17:32.676
<i>that makes headlines</i>
<i>on a daily basis.</i>

17:32.751 --> 17:36.710
If they discover what is going on,
we could have a problem.

17:36.789 --> 17:37.813
Oh, no!

17:37.890 --> 17:39.152
Oh, yes, sir!

17:39.224 --> 17:40.555
Well, then, do something!

17:40.626 --> 17:41.854
What are you suggesting?

17:41.927 --> 17:44.225
I don't know! Keep them busy!

17:45.264 --> 17:47.027
Perhaps I could distract them.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.966
Yes. Distract them.

17:50.035 --> 17:51.400
W-wait.

17:52.471 --> 17:53.699
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

17:53.772 --> 17:56.002
I have just the thing.

18:15.627 --> 18:17.754
It feels like Christmas, doesn't it?

18:17.830 --> 18:19.024
It does, yes.

18:19.098 --> 18:23.501
And considering it's a good
two degrees above freezing,

18:23.569 --> 18:25.560
I believe a toast is in order.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.430
My. How fancy.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.032
Oh, quite fancy.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.578
- I am a king, you know.
- Right.

18:33.645 --> 18:36.876
To my gorgeous, brilliant wife,

18:36.949 --> 18:38.280
who is quite the trouper

18:38.350 --> 18:41.217
for putting up with her
sometimes cranky husband

18:41.286 --> 18:43.720
and for finding us
some warmer clothes.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.279
I don't deserve you.

18:47.359 --> 18:48.951
I guess you're just lucky.

18:51.296 --> 18:52.354
Scott?

18:52.431 --> 18:53.523
Sorry?

18:53.599 --> 18:54.930
Scott?

18:55.701 --> 18:56.690
Paige?

18:57.803 --> 18:59.464
Holy cow!

18:59.538 --> 19:01.563
Paige Morgan!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.904
Hey!

19:05.811 --> 19:08.279
- Scott! How are you?
- Good. Really great.

19:08.347 --> 19:10.611
I'd ask how you are, but it'd be
kind of a dumb question...

19:10.682 --> 19:11.842
Your Majesty.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.612
Scott, this is my husband,

19:13.685 --> 19:14.845
King Edvard.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.217
Eddie, this is Scott Alberson.

19:16.288 --> 19:17.619
King Edvard!

19:18.157 --> 19:19.749
Just, um, Eddie.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.383
Scott, nice to meet you.

19:21.460 --> 19:22.950
We went to high school together.

19:23.028 --> 19:24.427
Yeah, like, a million years ago.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.054
It wasn't that long ago.

19:26.131 --> 19:27.621
Well, let's see now.

19:27.699 --> 19:30.691
Since high school, she's gone
to college, med school...

19:30.769 --> 19:33.499
Oh! And become
queen of Denmark!

19:34.706 --> 19:36.264
Scott, what are you doing here?

19:36.341 --> 19:39.071
You mean, what am I doing
in a tiny little country,

19:39.144 --> 19:41.135
middle of nowhere,
no one's ever even heard of?

19:41.213 --> 19:42.874
Yes, that's what I mean.

19:42.948 --> 19:44.779
Well, you know
I'm a journalist now.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.410
I was in Lithuania
doing a travel piece.

19:47.486 --> 19:50.080
Someone told me about
this amazing nature preserve.

19:50.155 --> 19:51.952
Thought I'd check it out.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.454
Scott, can you do us a favor
and not tell anyone we're here?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.428
We kind of just want to be alone.

19:58.497 --> 20:00.158
Right. Of course not.

20:00.232 --> 20:02.462
The... the press, you know.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.435
Right! Alone!

20:05.504 --> 20:06.937
Okay, yeah, I'm gone.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.269
Seriously, I'm gone.
Nice to meet you.

20:09.341 --> 20:10.831
- Eh, Eddie!
- Yo!

20:13.011 --> 20:14.171
Good night, Paige.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.404
By the way...

20:16.481 --> 20:19.575
is it Dr. Paige now,
or Queen Paige?

20:20.686 --> 20:24.349
It's... Paige.
It's still... just Paige.

20:27.192 --> 20:29.160
Wow.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.968
Try to change
the subject.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.971
- Whoops!
- Bags.

20:41.039 --> 20:42.870
I guess
the wild dogs got to them.

20:42.941 --> 20:44.135
Or the bears.

20:44.209 --> 20:45.836
I'm so sorry.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.778
We'll deal with it later.
Thank you, Marcellus. Good night.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.315
- Good night, Your Majesties.
- Good night.

20:51.383 --> 20:54.216
So, this Scott fellow...

20:54.286 --> 20:56.811
was he, um,
a very good friend?

20:56.888 --> 20:59.721
He was. I haven't seen him
since graduation.

21:00.726 --> 21:04.457
Were you... did you...
date at all?

21:04.529 --> 21:07.225
Eddie, are you jealous?

21:07.299 --> 21:08.891
Jeal...? No!

21:11.637 --> 21:13.366
- Should I be?
- Yes.

21:14.606 --> 21:16.096
We dated in high school.

21:16.808 --> 21:18.036
Right.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.634
But you broke up.

21:20.746 --> 21:22.236
I wanted to go to med school.

21:22.314 --> 21:24.714
He wanted me to be
someone else.

21:25.250 --> 21:26.239
Oh.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.580
I think he's over it.

21:27.653 --> 21:31.646
Mmm. Don't know.
Bet you're quite hard to get over.

21:31.723 --> 21:34.248
Well, between you and me...

21:34.326 --> 21:35.623
Mmm?

21:35.694 --> 21:39.061
I like you a lot more
than I ever liked him.

21:41.266 --> 21:42.460
Yeah?

21:43.969 --> 21:45.334
Yeah.

22:15.634 --> 22:19.263
No, l... I'm just saying
that I don't look very dignified.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.965
Maybe I should go back.

22:21.039 --> 22:23.234
Oh, Eddie, don't be silly.

22:23.308 --> 22:26.175
It's the only outfit I could find
that would fit you.

22:26.244 --> 22:28.144
Besides,
you're not a king right now.

22:28.213 --> 22:29.976
You're just a guy
on his honeymoon.

22:30.048 --> 22:32.516
Yeah, a very silly-looking guy
on his honeymoon.

22:32.584 --> 22:33.744
Wow.

22:35.954 --> 22:37.387
He looks pretty good.

22:41.226 --> 22:42.352
Hey, guys.

22:43.895 --> 22:45.658
Scott! Um...

22:45.731 --> 22:47.323
Hi.

22:47.399 --> 22:50.061
Whoa, Eddie, that is some outfit!

22:50.135 --> 22:51.500
All right, that's it.
I'm going back.

22:51.570 --> 22:52.559
I'm just kidding.

22:52.637 --> 22:54.468
Come on,
what are you guys doing?

22:54.539 --> 22:55.870
You up for a little boarding?

22:55.941 --> 22:57.806
Oh, no. I'm just a skier.

22:57.876 --> 22:59.707
I've actually never tried it.

22:59.778 --> 23:01.746
Better not. Wouldn't want
to kill the king.

23:03.749 --> 23:05.478
Well, actually,
I'm a pretty good skier.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.814
- It's not that different, is it?
- No.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.013
Oh... I don't know.

23:10.088 --> 23:11.715
Aw, you don't mind, do you?

23:11.790 --> 23:13.223
You can follow on your skis.

23:14.292 --> 23:15.691
- Okay.
- Cool!

23:15.761 --> 23:18.161
Let's go get you some gear!

23:24.603 --> 23:27.697
Well... here we are.

23:27.773 --> 23:28.933
This is it?

23:29.007 --> 23:30.599
It's nice.

23:30.675 --> 23:32.040
Looks easy enough.

23:32.110 --> 23:33.509
You'll be just fine.

23:37.783 --> 23:40.183
Now, uh, remember...

23:40.252 --> 23:43.221
keep your weight forward
and use your hands.

23:43.288 --> 23:47.281
Right. We'll see you
at the bottom.

23:47.359 --> 23:48.917
Yeah.

23:48.994 --> 23:51.622
And, uh, be careful.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.960
Oh, I could do that.

24:00.939 --> 24:02.804
Or maybe not.

24:07.813 --> 24:08.973
Oh, boy.

24:34.806 --> 24:35.932
Eddie?

24:36.007 --> 24:37.497
Are you okay?

24:39.211 --> 24:40.269
Ow.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.176
Hey, come on!

25:03.068 --> 25:04.365
Yeah, baby!

25:19.217 --> 25:21.117
You sure you want to do this one?

25:21.186 --> 25:23.051
I mean, we could always go back in.

25:24.789 --> 25:25.983
First one down.

25:26.057 --> 25:27.524
Ha ha!

25:54.452 --> 25:56.249
Come on, come on!

26:03.395 --> 26:04.692
What was that?

26:05.630 --> 26:07.689
What's the matter?

26:09.834 --> 26:11.825
I'm coming, I'm coming!

26:14.306 --> 26:16.171
Come on, come on, come on!

26:21.746 --> 26:24.579
Where, where, where, where?
What? Through here?

26:26.818 --> 26:28.410
- Mama! Mama!
- Okay, that's okay!

26:33.992 --> 26:35.960
No, no, no, no. Stay.
It's all right.

26:36.027 --> 26:37.187
Don't move.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.460
It's okay.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.260
It's okay. I got it.

26:43.335 --> 26:44.267
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

26:52.477 --> 26:54.570
Wait.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.638
Paige! Paige!

26:59.985 --> 27:02.545
- Got you.
- Careful, Paige.

27:07.392 --> 27:08.518
Come on.

27:21.406 --> 27:24.068
You okay?
Let me see your wrist.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.340
You were, uh...

27:31.349 --> 27:34.284
That was, uh...
that was, uh... really...

27:34.352 --> 27:36.513
...cool, what you did back there.

27:37.522 --> 27:39.513
Well, it's just what anyone
would have done.

27:40.659 --> 27:41.853
Not anyone.

27:43.561 --> 27:46.997
He's going to be okay...
just a few scrapes and bruises.

27:47.065 --> 27:48.965
You okay, Eddie?

27:49.034 --> 27:53.027
Yeah. I think
a little respite is in order.

27:53.104 --> 27:55.971
Yeah, I think we've had
enough excitement for today.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.668
We'll see you, Scott.

27:57.742 --> 27:59.642
Okay.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.474
Oh, thanks for the lesson.

28:01.546 --> 28:02.706
Yeah.

28:04.349 --> 28:05.839
Anytime.

28:20.899 --> 28:23.026
Oh, Eddie. A wolverine.

28:23.101 --> 28:25.296
They're everywhere here.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.167
This place is wonderful.

28:27.238 --> 28:29.399
You said it covers half the country?

28:29.474 --> 28:30.566
Yes.

28:30.642 --> 28:32.701
Oh, wow, look.

28:32.777 --> 28:34.711
Imperial eagle.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.376
Why don't more people
know about this,

28:38.450 --> 28:40.475
this preserve?

28:40.552 --> 28:44.181
Well, Belavia's
an undeveloped country.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.416
It's to their advantage,
in many ways.

28:47.425 --> 28:49.359
Maybe we could help them.

28:49.427 --> 28:52.362
You know,
promote some eco-tourism.

28:52.430 --> 28:53.954
It's a brilliant idea.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.729
Eddie, look.

28:57.802 --> 29:00.999
A deer. Do you think
it'll let us get closer?

29:01.072 --> 29:03.233
I'm sure it wouldn't mind,
if you asked it politely.

29:09.280 --> 29:11.748
Shh. She's onto us.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.477
Where'd she go?

29:14.486 --> 29:16.545
Outwitted by a deer.

29:16.621 --> 29:19.089
She was right here.

29:23.962 --> 29:25.623
What are those doing here?

29:27.465 --> 29:29.399
I don't know.

29:29.467 --> 29:30.957
I'm going to find out.

29:32.303 --> 29:34.430
I want it razed to the ground.

29:34.506 --> 29:37.942
Not a tree trunk, not a twig,
not a little furry creature left.

29:38.009 --> 29:39.499
Translate that.

29:39.577 --> 29:40.737
- Excuse me.
- What?

29:40.812 --> 29:43.713
Your Majesty.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.409
Your Majesties.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.951
You're Danish.
Who are you, sir?

29:48.019 --> 29:51.147
Oliver Laertes, Foreign Ministry.

29:51.222 --> 29:54.817
I wish I had known you were coming.
I would have arranged a greeting.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.952
What are you
and all these men doing here?

29:58.463 --> 30:02.695
I'm here to make sure
everything is proceeding as planned.

30:02.767 --> 30:05.998
You must be here
for a surprise inspection.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.061
Inspection of what?

30:08.139 --> 30:11.006
Um... the clearing of the forest.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.406
For what?

30:13.511 --> 30:15.945
To make room for the pipeline.

30:16.014 --> 30:17.879
An <i>oil</i> pipeline?

30:19.050 --> 30:20.540
Who ordered this,
and by what right?

30:20.618 --> 30:23.917
Um... I believe
Prime Minister Polonius has obtained

30:23.988 --> 30:26.081
all rights to the local oil reserves,

30:26.157 --> 30:29.422
with the signed agreement
of the Belavian monarch, of course.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.553
This must be
where he went on his trip.

30:32.697 --> 30:35.222
Let me be clear, Mr. Laertes.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.632
Please. Oliver, Your Majesty.

30:37.702 --> 30:38.999
Oliver.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.561
This endeavor is not the will
of Denmark.

30:41.639 --> 30:43.607
I don't know what
the prime minister thinks he's doing,

30:43.675 --> 30:45.734
but he does not have
the blessing of Parliament,

30:45.810 --> 30:47.175
nor mine.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.142
Where can I get a land line?

30:50.215 --> 30:53.082
Um... the nearest one's in town.

30:53.151 --> 30:54.482
Thank you.

30:55.987 --> 30:58.820
- Oh, and Oliver.
- Yes, Your Majesty?

30:58.890 --> 31:00.289
Don't cut anything down.

31:00.358 --> 31:02.519
Of course not, Your Majesty.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.400
Yes! Put him on immediately!

31:20.411 --> 31:22.038
Tell him it's Oliver!

31:22.113 --> 31:25.742
Your Majesty,
all day he has been calling... Mr. Soren.

31:26.784 --> 31:28.581
Soren. Talk to me.

31:29.587 --> 31:32.420
Yes. Yes, I understand.

31:34.692 --> 31:35.852
What?

31:38.096 --> 31:40.394
Um, thank you, Soren.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.695
Patch me through
to the prime minister, will you?

31:44.035 --> 31:45.866
- Well?
- It's true.

31:45.937 --> 31:49.998
Polonius is attempting to seize
the land by eminent domain

31:50.074 --> 31:53.043
and has proposed an amendment
to the Conservation Act

31:53.111 --> 31:55.579
in order to allow him to drill for oil.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.005
Can he just do that?

31:58.082 --> 32:02.519
Not just that, he's called an emergency
session in Parliament to vote on it,

32:02.587 --> 32:04.521
three days from now.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.216
But that's Christmas Eve.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.920
He doesn't care.
He... he's running for reelection.

32:09.994 --> 32:12.394
He thinks that this travesty
will clinch it for him.

32:12.463 --> 32:14.294
<i>- Your Majesty.</i>
- What was that?

32:15.967 --> 32:18.401
Oh, he is, is he? Um...

32:19.637 --> 32:21.730
No, that'll be all.

32:21.806 --> 32:23.330
Let me know
if you hear anything else.

32:26.444 --> 32:27.672
He's tied up.

32:28.846 --> 32:30.541
We need to go home, Eddie.

32:30.615 --> 32:32.014
You'll talk to Parliament.

32:32.083 --> 32:35.246
Yes. I need to speak
to the prince first.

32:35.320 --> 32:38.153
Mr. Soren says that the jet
is standing by.

32:39.991 --> 32:41.185
Unless...

32:41.259 --> 32:43.386
Unless we fight Polonius from here,

32:43.461 --> 32:45.088
right here from Belavia.

32:45.163 --> 32:46.528
We bring the media here,

32:46.597 --> 32:49.623
to the very land
this proposal would destroy.

32:49.701 --> 32:50.690
They would love it.

32:50.768 --> 32:53.032
"Royal couple takes up cause
on honeymoon."

32:53.104 --> 32:54.799
That would also give you
time to see the prince.

32:54.872 --> 32:57.636
But what about your honeymoon?

33:00.545 --> 33:01.569
Paige, I'm sorry.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.637
Eddie, we have the rest of
our lives to be together.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.445
Are we going
to save Belavia or what?

33:06.517 --> 33:07.950
You are an amazing woman.

33:08.019 --> 33:09.452
Let's do it!

33:36.714 --> 33:38.147
Pardon me, Your Majesty.

33:38.216 --> 33:40.241
The prince is not available.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.513
Not available?

33:43.521 --> 33:45.148
This is urgent business.

33:45.223 --> 33:48.522
Yes, Your Majesty,
but he was not expecting you.

33:51.062 --> 33:52.825
Are you telling me
he will not see me?

33:52.897 --> 33:56.424
No. No, Your Majesty,
it's simply... he's busy.

33:57.502 --> 34:00.494
But he did instruct me
to invite you and your queen

34:00.571 --> 34:02.562
to our holiday ball tonight.

34:03.574 --> 34:04.734
Holiday ball.

34:09.414 --> 34:10.972
All right. Fine.

34:11.049 --> 34:13.313
Please tell the prince we accept.

34:13.384 --> 34:15.375
I look forward
to speaking to him tonight.

34:15.453 --> 34:17.080
Yes, Your Majesty.

34:20.925 --> 34:22.085
Thank you.

34:23.393 --> 34:25.658
No, that's great, Scott.
As soon as you can, okay?

34:34.605 --> 34:36.596
- Please.
- Of course.

34:39.643 --> 34:40.940
- Paige?
- Eddie.

34:41.946 --> 34:43.811
- How'd it go?
- Was that Scott?

34:43.880 --> 34:45.871
Yes! I ran into him again.

34:45.949 --> 34:47.918
Great news. Soren said that
all the major papers

34:47.985 --> 34:50.351
and television stations
are on their way,

34:50.420 --> 34:52.753
and Scott's been helping out,
making calls to smaller outfits.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.155
That's good news.

34:54.225 --> 34:56.216
What happened?
What did the prince say?

34:56.293 --> 34:59.058
He didn't.
He wouldn't see me.

34:59.130 --> 35:01.155
What? He wouldn't
see you? Why?

35:01.232 --> 35:03.530
I don't know. It's quite clear
something's going on.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.502
You know, I haven't been
refused an audience since...

35:07.972 --> 35:11.237
well, ever.
I've never been refused.

35:11.309 --> 35:14.506
Does he know we only have
two days to stop this thing?

35:14.579 --> 35:16.911
I assume so, but maybe not.

35:16.981 --> 35:19.506
He's invited us to his
holiday ball tonight.

35:19.584 --> 35:21.074
- Have you not heard from Polonius?
- No.

35:22.587 --> 35:26.250
Excuse me, Your Majesties, um,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

35:26.324 --> 35:27.518
If I may.

35:28.526 --> 35:31.290
I am told the prince can be
a rather difficult man.

35:32.330 --> 35:33.524
In what way?

35:33.598 --> 35:37.762
Perhaps a little senile.
It's hard to say.

35:37.835 --> 35:42.363
He does seem to have
a special dislike for the Crown.

35:43.841 --> 35:45.103
Really?

35:45.176 --> 35:48.202
But you will see for yourself.
If there's anything I can do to...

35:48.279 --> 35:51.612
No, Oliver, you can do your part
by staying those bulldozers, okay?

35:51.682 --> 35:53.946
Of course, Your Majesty.
Good day.

35:55.186 --> 35:56.380
What do we do now?

35:56.454 --> 35:57.785
The prince will be here very soon.

35:57.855 --> 35:59.880
I can't wait any longer.
I need to start talking to Parliament.

35:59.957 --> 36:02.255
I've no doubt Polonius
is doing exactly the same.

36:02.326 --> 36:03.452
Marcellus!

36:03.528 --> 36:05.723
I don't care if his phones are busy.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.627
This is my fourth call.

36:07.698 --> 36:09.632
Put me through to him now!

36:09.700 --> 36:11.827
Well, yes, Madame Chairman,
that is exactly the case.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.168
You have my deepest gratitude
for your support.

36:15.239 --> 36:16.467
Good day.

36:19.377 --> 36:20.537
Yes?

36:22.713 --> 36:23.839
Mr. Prime Minister.

36:23.915 --> 36:26.145
With all due respect, Your Majesty,

36:26.217 --> 36:29.152
what exactly are you doing
in Belavia?

36:29.220 --> 36:30.346
Well, it's a funny thing.

36:30.421 --> 36:33.788
I, uh, discovered that you
intended to demolish

36:33.858 --> 36:36.349
one of my kingdom's
national treasures

36:36.427 --> 36:37.792
<i>while I was out of town.</i>

36:37.862 --> 36:39.955
Merely a coincidence.

36:40.031 --> 36:42.829
That I doubt,
because I know your tactics.

36:42.900 --> 36:45.767
<i>Do you really think this little</i>
<i>publicity stunt of yours</i>

36:45.836 --> 36:47.701
<i>is going to stop me?</i>

36:47.772 --> 36:49.000
I do, yes.

36:50.408 --> 36:53.104
Don't go to battle
with me, Your Majesty.

36:53.177 --> 36:55.611
You don't have
the stomach for it.

36:56.714 --> 37:00.172
Belavia is under
the protection of the Crown.

37:00.251 --> 37:02.879
You will not destroy it
for political gain.

37:02.954 --> 37:04.387
I will not allow it.

37:05.389 --> 37:06.947
Do you think the people
will thank you

37:07.024 --> 37:08.958
<i>for higher gas prices?</i>

37:09.026 --> 37:11.722
My people care about
more than just gas prices.

37:11.796 --> 37:13.127
Oh, do they?

37:13.197 --> 37:14.892
We'll see about that.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.867
<i>Enjoy your honeymoon,</i>
<i>Your Majesty.</i>

37:19.637 --> 37:21.400
Polonius?

37:23.274 --> 37:24.434
Yes.

37:25.443 --> 37:28.640
You know, I don't believe
he's very fond of me.

37:30.615 --> 37:31.809
He's been busy

37:31.882 --> 37:34.146
lobbying the legislators
to vote for his measure.

37:35.286 --> 37:36.480
How are we doing?

37:36.554 --> 37:37.885
Well, the Speaker seems inclined.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.685
Some are shortsighted, but...

37:40.758 --> 37:42.919
once we have the prince behind us,
Parliament will fall in line.

37:42.994 --> 37:46.122
Speaking of which,
look what Marcellus found for you.

37:46.964 --> 37:48.158
Great.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.061
Let's go and talk to the prince.

38:32.276 --> 38:33.641
Bravo!

38:40.484 --> 38:45.148
- Merry Christmas!
- Happy holidays!

38:47.024 --> 38:50.482
Wait. Stay there
and don't move your muscles.

38:54.365 --> 39:00.133
Their Royal Majesties,
King Edvard and Queen Paige.

39:01.706 --> 39:04.004
It's going to be a great party.

39:07.011 --> 39:08.444
Hey, guys.

39:08.512 --> 39:11.743
Wow. You look... gorgeous.

39:11.816 --> 39:13.408
Just like prom, huh?

39:14.518 --> 39:16.486
You'll be happy to hear,
I called in all my chips,

39:16.554 --> 39:18.852
even saw one of my friends
from BBC Nature checking in already.

39:18.923 --> 39:21.187
Thank you, Scott.
Your help is appreciated.

39:21.258 --> 39:25.160
Your Majesties, Prince Georgiev
would like you to join him at his table.

39:25.229 --> 39:26.662
Of course, Oliver, thank you.

39:27.732 --> 39:29.290
Would you excuse us, Scott.

39:29.367 --> 39:30.493
Oh, yeah.

39:30.568 --> 39:35.028
Actually, Your Majesty, I have arranged it
so that your friend can join us.

39:36.407 --> 39:37.601
Cool!

39:37.675 --> 39:39.006
Thanks.

39:40.878 --> 39:42.675
Lovely.

39:42.747 --> 39:43.907
Scott.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.508
Okay. Sure.

39:47.585 --> 39:48.745
What was that?

39:48.819 --> 39:50.684
I was just saying
that tonight is off the record.

39:50.755 --> 39:51.881
You know, no reporting.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.150
Good thinking.

39:53.224 --> 39:55.749
So, you went to the prom
with this guy.

39:56.761 --> 39:58.786
Forget about Scott.
Focus on the prince.

39:58.863 --> 40:00.353
Yeah, but prom, isn't that...

40:01.365 --> 40:02.696
sig... significant?

40:02.767 --> 40:03.825
The prince.

40:03.901 --> 40:05.368
We need his support.

40:05.436 --> 40:07.563
Right. Later we'll talk
about this prom business.

40:07.638 --> 40:08.696
Yes.

40:08.773 --> 40:12.732
May I present King Edvard
and Queen Paige of Denmark.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.938
The Honorable
Prince Georgiev III of Belavia.

40:23.587 --> 40:25.384
My Queen, a word of caution.

40:25.456 --> 40:28.482
Local custom requires that women
avert their eyes from the prince.

40:28.559 --> 40:29.719
Why?

40:29.794 --> 40:32.126
It's a custom hundreds
of years old. Protocol.

40:44.809 --> 40:47.243
Your Highness, I need to speak
to you about the nature preserve.

40:49.647 --> 40:50.807
We love...

40:53.851 --> 40:55.682
We love Belavia, Your Highness.

40:55.753 --> 40:57.516
The people have made us
feel very welcome.

41:03.961 --> 41:06.054
Prince Georgiev,

41:06.130 --> 41:07.757
you signed an agreement

41:07.832 --> 41:11.461
with the Danish prime minister
regarding oil rights. Why?

41:11.535 --> 41:13.264
I had no choice.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.805
You gave me no choice.

41:17.875 --> 41:20.400
Sorry. I don't understand.

41:20.478 --> 41:25.381
It is your will,
so Polonius said.

41:25.449 --> 41:27.041
You pretend to be a friend to us.

41:27.117 --> 41:28.277
You're no friend.

41:29.487 --> 41:32.251
You send here
people like that one,

41:32.323 --> 41:36.623
with bulldozers to destroy
what is best about Belavia.

41:36.694 --> 41:38.719
And what do we get in return?

41:38.796 --> 41:40.161
A pittance.

41:40.231 --> 41:43.462
I give you my word.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.128
I knew nothing about this
before this week.

41:46.203 --> 41:49.832
Yes, of course. You don't know what
your own government is planning.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.268
Are you calling me a liar?

41:55.412 --> 42:00.042
And am I too a liar sent here
to destroy your country?

42:02.319 --> 42:04.514
I didn't mean to offend Your Majesty.

42:04.588 --> 42:06.681
You didn't offend me.

42:06.757 --> 42:09.453
I understand your position.

42:09.527 --> 42:12.428
My father often dealt with men
who made promises.

42:12.496 --> 42:14.293
They tried to take our farm.

42:14.365 --> 42:16.128
They almost did.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.760
But you are wrong about us.

42:18.836 --> 42:22.272
The king and I have taken on
your cause on our honeymoon,

42:22.339 --> 42:24.933
and if you value your kingdom,
you will listen to him,

42:25.009 --> 42:27.534
because right now he's
the only one who can help you.

42:31.749 --> 42:34.718
- If what you say is true...
- It is.

42:38.756 --> 42:40.951
Then I will listen.

42:45.429 --> 42:47.693
She's a good wife. Smart.

42:47.765 --> 42:48.993
Brilliant.

42:49.066 --> 42:50.294
Yes.

42:50.367 --> 42:54.326
I will be very careful
not to make her angry in the future.

42:54.405 --> 42:55.599
That's probably wise.

42:57.274 --> 43:01.802
I was rude.
Please accept my apology.

43:02.913 --> 43:04.278
I accept.

43:05.049 --> 43:07.882
Perhaps you can
make it up to me with a dance.

43:08.953 --> 43:10.545
It will be an honor, my queen.

44:22.393 --> 44:23.724
So, here it is...

44:23.794 --> 44:27.787
tomorrow I will hold a press
conference in the preserve

44:27.865 --> 44:29.332
and show the world

44:29.400 --> 44:32.164
what everyone would be losing
if the forest were razed.

44:32.236 --> 44:33.965
You think they'll listen?

44:34.038 --> 44:37.337
The people will,
and so will Parliament.

44:37.408 --> 44:39.638
You have much faith
in your people.

44:39.710 --> 44:40.768
And yours.

44:40.844 --> 44:44.439
Which is why I'd like you standing
next to me at the press conference.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.380
I would be honored.

44:47.751 --> 44:49.844
Thank you, Scott,
for all your help.

44:49.920 --> 44:51.319
No problem.

44:51.388 --> 44:54.380
He's done it. He's going
to save the preserve.

44:57.227 --> 45:01.163
You, um... you really love him,
don't you?

45:01.231 --> 45:02.493
I do.

45:02.566 --> 45:04.659
More than I ever
thought possible.

45:08.572 --> 45:10.267
I should go.

45:10.340 --> 45:11.671
Oh. Okay.

45:11.742 --> 45:13.539
Good night. Thank you.

45:13.610 --> 45:15.237
- Sure.
- For everything.

45:29.960 --> 45:31.951
- Hello.
- Whoa.

45:39.269 --> 45:41.362
What are you doing
in my room, man?

45:42.573 --> 45:44.438
- Sorry for the fright, Scott.
- What are you doing here?

45:44.508 --> 45:46.874
How was the party?
Fun time?

45:46.944 --> 45:51.904
From what my aide tells me,
things didn't go all that well.

45:51.982 --> 45:56.817
So tell me, what happened tonight
that was not part of our plan?

45:56.887 --> 45:59.549
What is going on? Hmm?

45:59.623 --> 46:02.091
You told me this was just
about Paige and the king.

46:02.159 --> 46:04.525
My business is not your concern.

46:04.595 --> 46:07.063
You were instructed
to distract them,

46:07.131 --> 46:09.224
to sabotage their
so-called honeymoon.

46:09.299 --> 46:11.267
That's what I paid you for.

46:11.335 --> 46:14.532
That's why I pulled you
out of that small-town paper.

46:14.605 --> 46:18.268
And this...
is the best you can do?

46:22.813 --> 46:23.973
Ahh.

46:24.047 --> 46:27.744
"The king and queen of Denmark
save the life of an 8-year-old."

46:27.818 --> 46:29.809
Yes, I've read it.

46:29.887 --> 46:31.514
Everyone's read it.

46:31.588 --> 46:34.079
It made headlines
all over the world.

46:34.158 --> 46:38.026
And what do you counter
this hero story with, Scott?

46:38.095 --> 46:40.757
Oh. Here it is.

46:43.167 --> 46:46.398
I don't care if he looks silly
on a bloody snowboard.

46:46.470 --> 46:48.870
I'm trying to ruin a man,
not make him blush.

46:48.939 --> 46:50.736
Well, you know what?
I'm not up for this anymore, so...

46:54.411 --> 46:56.345
That was a mistake.

46:56.413 --> 46:58.574
Let me ask you
a question, Scott.

46:58.649 --> 47:01.311
Do I look like a man
to be trifled with?

47:03.987 --> 47:07.684
You have no idea what I've
done to reach my position,

47:07.758 --> 47:10.693
or what I will do to maintain it.

47:10.761 --> 47:14.959
Let me tell you what the consequences
of you reneging on our deal would be.

47:16.500 --> 47:21.870
The queen will learn that
you are in fact not her friend,

47:21.939 --> 47:24.772
but an opportunist

47:24.842 --> 47:27.276
after monetary gain.

47:27.344 --> 47:30.905
I would then make it my business
to destroy any hopes you may have

47:30.981 --> 47:33.541
of becoming an important writer.

47:33.617 --> 47:37.053
And last, but certainly
not least, my friend,

47:37.120 --> 47:39.384
is that note on your mother's farm.

47:39.456 --> 47:41.981
You promised! You promised!

47:43.961 --> 47:46.623
Do you understand what I'm saying?

47:46.797 --> 47:49.027
Do you understand what I'm saying?

47:50.400 --> 47:53.335
Do you understand what I'm saying?

47:55.873 --> 47:57.135
Yeah.

48:00.911 --> 48:02.139
Good.

48:08.585 --> 48:12.112
Then tomorrow
we up the stakes.

48:13.123 --> 48:16.286
Tomorrow, nothing goes right
for this boy-king.

48:17.294 --> 48:19.922
We must show the world
his incompetence.

48:24.368 --> 48:25.596
Good night.

48:31.942 --> 48:34.843
You will tell no one
that the prime minister is here.

48:35.479 --> 48:36.639
Understood?

48:37.948 --> 48:39.381
Understood?

48:58.468 --> 48:59.628
Yes?

49:06.810 --> 49:08.539
Good morning, Your Majesty.

49:08.612 --> 49:09.874
Is, um, the king available?

49:09.947 --> 49:11.847
Um... no, he's getting ready.

49:11.915 --> 49:13.075
Can I help you?

49:16.119 --> 49:18.417
Um... no.

49:19.423 --> 49:22.790
Yes. I've arranged your
transportation to the conference.

49:22.859 --> 49:24.451
Whenever you're ready,
Your Majesty.

49:24.528 --> 49:26.018
Thank you, Oliver.

49:43.647 --> 49:46.548
Aaah! Ohhh!

49:46.616 --> 49:48.641
Eddie?

49:48.719 --> 49:50.380
Ohh! Aah!

49:50.454 --> 49:51.887
Are you okay?

49:52.889 --> 49:54.447
Ow.

49:54.524 --> 49:57.652
There they are.
Here they come.

49:57.728 --> 50:00.492
Your Majesties, will you
be spending Christmas in Belavia?

50:01.798 --> 50:04.096
Will you really do battle
with Prime Minister Polonius?

50:04.167 --> 50:06.658
I will explain everything
at the press conference. Thank you.

50:11.708 --> 50:13.471
Your Majesty, what happened?

50:13.543 --> 50:15.340
He slipped in the shower.

50:15.412 --> 50:18.939
I didn't slip. I was scalded
by some extremely hot water,

50:19.016 --> 50:21.109
and so I leapt out.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.515
You leapt?

50:22.586 --> 50:23.848
Doesn't matter, does it?

50:23.920 --> 50:26.514
I've got a very,
very good feeling about today,

50:26.590 --> 50:28.490
and I don't want anything to ruin it.

50:29.192 --> 50:30.386
What's the itinerary?

50:30.460 --> 50:32.485
When you arrive
at the nature preserve,

50:32.562 --> 50:35.190
the press and Prince Georgiev
will be waiting.

50:35.265 --> 50:38.962
And here is your transportation...
very environmentally friendly.

50:39.036 --> 50:41.129
- Great.
- Eddie, look who it is.

50:45.242 --> 50:46.368
Thank you, Oliver.

50:47.310 --> 50:48.436
Hello!

50:50.080 --> 50:51.206
Who's this guy?

50:56.153 --> 50:57.347
Okay!

50:59.756 --> 51:01.849
Don't know if I like
the look of this fellow.

51:01.925 --> 51:03.415
Kind of looks like a Mob guy.

51:06.930 --> 51:09.455
- Okay?
- Great. Okay.

51:10.467 --> 51:12.526
Good luck,
Your Majesties. See you there!

51:12.602 --> 51:13.796
Bye!

51:18.642 --> 51:19.802
Have fun.

51:36.159 --> 51:39.060
Well, I flew straight from Frankfurt.
Couldn't miss this.

51:40.464 --> 51:43.592
Yeah. Yeah,
it's a big deal, I guess.

51:43.667 --> 51:48.263
It is... not every day a king goes up
against his prime minister.

52:08.358 --> 52:10.724
It's definitely his brother.

52:10.794 --> 52:12.318
Or his cousin.

52:12.395 --> 52:14.420
I think he said it was his dad.

52:15.699 --> 52:16.893
His dad?

52:16.967 --> 52:18.457
Or his son.

52:20.036 --> 52:21.230
Or his son!

52:21.304 --> 52:23.534
It's his dad <i>or</i> his son.

52:24.808 --> 52:26.537
Are we nearly there?

52:34.718 --> 52:37.380
I wonder where they are.

52:37.454 --> 52:39.251
I hope they didn't have an accident.

52:39.322 --> 52:40.482
There.

52:44.060 --> 52:45.357
Oh!

52:45.428 --> 52:46.622
Brilliant.

52:47.631 --> 52:49.792
Is King Edvard riding in a sleigh?

52:49.866 --> 52:51.060
Apparently.

52:52.068 --> 52:53.399
Excuse me, won't you?

53:06.316 --> 53:07.840
The queen! The queen!

53:07.918 --> 53:09.180
Go! Go!

53:09.252 --> 53:10.879
Oliver, what are you doing?

53:11.721 --> 53:14.417
- Why are we getting off here?
- Excuse me!

53:14.491 --> 53:17.551
I thought it might be better,
Your Majesty. You see...

53:17.627 --> 53:19.527
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

53:20.764 --> 53:21.856
the monarch...

53:26.203 --> 53:27.192
Aah!

53:27.904 --> 53:28.962
Eddie!

53:30.407 --> 53:31.203
Eddie!

53:33.076 --> 53:34.134
- Eddie!
- Paige!

53:35.612 --> 53:37.409
Somebody help! Eddie!

53:39.249 --> 53:40.273
Eddie!

53:41.918 --> 53:44.580
- Oh, no! Eddie!
- Look out!

53:50.260 --> 53:51.249
Eddie!

53:52.929 --> 53:54.089
Look out!

53:57.968 --> 53:59.196
Eddie, oh!

54:19.789 --> 54:22.280
Eddie! Eddie.

54:24.961 --> 54:26.553
He got some good distance.

54:26.630 --> 54:28.325
Eddie, are you okay?

54:30.133 --> 54:31.293
Yes.

54:32.736 --> 54:33.896
I'm f...

54:35.238 --> 54:36.569
Scott, help me.

54:38.975 --> 54:40.670
People! People!

54:40.744 --> 54:42.905
May I please have your attention.

54:46.316 --> 54:49.183
Regretfully,
under the circumstances,

54:49.252 --> 54:51.914
we're obliged to cancel
today's press conference.

54:51.988 --> 54:55.446
We look forward to seeing you
once the king recovers.

54:55.525 --> 54:58.119
- We're coming, Eddie.
- Face in the snow.

55:00.830 --> 55:03.856
I did not tell you to cancel
the press conference.

55:03.933 --> 55:06.629
You were buried in snow, sir.

55:06.703 --> 55:09.001
I apologize for any misunderstanding.

55:10.540 --> 55:13.168
In less than 18 hours,
Parliament will vote,

55:13.243 --> 55:16.303
and unless Prince Georgiev and I
get in front of those cameras,

55:16.379 --> 55:19.280
this fight is done.
You understand?

55:19.349 --> 55:22.477
I'll get on it right away, sir.

55:25.388 --> 55:28.255
Here. Eddie,
do you want to talk?

55:28.325 --> 55:31.123
No. No, I don't want
to talk about it.

55:31.194 --> 55:34.220
Not now, okay?
Maybe not ever.

55:36.032 --> 55:37.795
Enter.

55:38.868 --> 55:39.892
Hey, guys.

55:42.038 --> 55:43.335
I just, uh...

55:43.406 --> 55:45.271
I just wanted to check up
on Edvard.

55:45.342 --> 55:46.604
You all right?

55:46.676 --> 55:47.665
Yeah.

55:47.744 --> 55:48.870
No!

55:48.945 --> 55:50.742
Pretty far from all right, actually.

55:50.814 --> 55:51.974
Do you know why?

55:52.048 --> 55:53.845
My shower
attacked me this morning,

55:53.917 --> 55:56.977
I've just been
in a sleigh-riding accident,

55:57.053 --> 55:59.180
and, unless something
drastic happens,

55:59.255 --> 56:01.280
tomorrow afternoon
Parliament will vote

56:01.358 --> 56:04.327
to destroy this country's
nature preserve.

56:04.394 --> 56:05.986
So, nope,

56:06.062 --> 56:08.087
all right is what I am not.

56:08.164 --> 56:09.290
Eddie.

56:09.366 --> 56:12.563
And am I somehow
responsible for all that?

56:16.506 --> 56:17.905
I don't know, are you?

56:19.008 --> 56:20.703
What are you talking about?

56:20.777 --> 56:22.176
I don't know.

56:23.179 --> 56:26.637
You seem to be around
an awful lot, I know that.

56:27.717 --> 56:29.184
Every time I turn around,

56:29.252 --> 56:31.846
there's my wife's
good pal Scotty.

56:32.922 --> 56:35.015
Now, why is that, hmm?

56:35.091 --> 56:36.388
I mean, this is...

56:37.894 --> 56:39.794
<i>my</i> honeymoon, isn't it?

56:40.864 --> 56:42.388
Or at least it's supposed to be.

56:43.967 --> 56:47.459
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

56:47.537 --> 56:48.765
I'm gonna take off.

56:48.838 --> 56:51.272
- Yeah.
- Bye.

56:58.448 --> 57:01.383
Are you... happy now?

57:01.451 --> 57:05.387
You were just incredibly rude
to my good friend for no reason.

57:05.455 --> 57:06.717
Oh, no reason?

57:06.790 --> 57:07.848
Look at me!

57:07.924 --> 57:09.619
Scott didn't knock you out.

57:09.692 --> 57:11.216
He didn't burn you in the shower.

57:11.294 --> 57:12.886
He didn't wreck the sleigh.

57:12.962 --> 57:15.760
Just because you're having a bad day
doesn't mean you need to... blah!

57:15.832 --> 57:17.197
Sorry, "bad day"?

57:17.267 --> 57:20.395
Bad...? This isn't a bad day, Paige,

57:20.470 --> 57:22.370
this is a public relations nightmare!

57:22.439 --> 57:25.704
Well, I'm sorry you were
so miserable on our honeymoon!

57:25.775 --> 57:28.005
Well, then maybe
you shouldn't have been spending

57:28.077 --> 57:29.704
so much time with your boyfriend!

57:29.779 --> 57:33.374
Boyfriend? That's...
that's really mature, Eddie.

57:33.450 --> 57:36.385
And just for the record, I wanted
to spend yesterday with my husband,

57:36.453 --> 57:38.944
but you stupid boys
wouldn't stop competing

57:39.022 --> 57:40.284
even though you've already won!

57:47.497 --> 57:48.759
I need a drink.

58:03.680 --> 58:04.874
Thank you.

58:04.948 --> 58:06.643
My pleasure, Your Majesty.

58:08.518 --> 58:12.284
I spoke to Prince Georgiev,
per your instructions.

58:12.355 --> 58:14.323
He would like to sit
down with you in one hour

58:14.390 --> 58:16.358
to discuss the rescheduled
news conference.

58:17.360 --> 58:18.987
Um...

58:19.062 --> 58:20.654
Great.

58:20.730 --> 58:25.326
Excuse me, Your Majesty,
but is something bothering you?

58:25.401 --> 58:27.801
No, I'm fine. Thank you.

58:30.540 --> 58:31.871
Here's the thing, right?

58:32.475 --> 58:36.206
Why is he <i>always</i> hanging around?

58:36.279 --> 58:38.406
Whom are we talking about, sir?

58:38.481 --> 58:40.142
You know, <i>him.</i>

58:40.216 --> 58:41.547
"Eh, Scott!"

58:41.618 --> 58:43.643
The queen's schoolmate.

58:47.557 --> 58:50.321
I know what you're going to say.
I'm jealous.

58:51.394 --> 58:53.521
That is ridiculous.

58:53.596 --> 58:55.223
I mean, what do I have
to be jealous of?

58:56.633 --> 58:58.100
She's with me!

58:59.235 --> 59:00.566
I mean, we're married.

59:01.905 --> 59:03.532
We live in a castle.

59:05.441 --> 59:07.932
And I'm... I'm...
I'm a good catch, hmm?

59:09.112 --> 59:10.443
Hmm?

59:10.513 --> 59:13.676
For some reason... shh...

59:13.750 --> 59:17.846
this trip, I can't seem
to do anything right.

59:21.257 --> 59:23.555
These beers are strong,
aren't they?

59:24.928 --> 59:26.225
Maybe...

59:26.296 --> 59:29.265
the queen has given you
reason to be jealous?

59:30.466 --> 59:32.798
She'd never do anything to hurt me.
I trust her implicitly.

59:35.939 --> 59:37.770
Such a funny word, isn't it?

59:37.840 --> 59:39.933
What word is that, sir?

59:40.009 --> 59:41.408
"Implicitly."

59:44.948 --> 59:46.108
Perhaps...

59:47.116 --> 59:51.212
the relationship they had
is troubling you.

59:51.287 --> 59:52.413
Exactly!

59:55.291 --> 59:59.091
He knows things about her
that I will never know.

01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:03.458
What made her laugh as a girl...

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.462
what it was like to be her first kiss.

01:00:12.642 --> 01:00:14.576
But she's mine now, right?

01:00:14.644 --> 01:00:16.305
That's right, Your Majesty.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.974
I'm being so foolish.

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.574
I'm going to find her,

01:00:21.651 --> 01:00:24.745
and I'm going to tell her
how lucky I am that she's mine.

01:00:27.256 --> 01:00:30.123
I'm going to do that...
right now.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.124
Ah.

01:00:35.198 --> 01:00:36.859
Melancholy Dane.

01:00:40.003 --> 01:00:41.436
Check, please.

01:00:47.343 --> 01:00:48.867
You look pretty out here.

01:00:48.945 --> 01:00:51.277
Scott. You scared me.

01:00:51.347 --> 01:00:52.473
Sorry.

01:00:52.548 --> 01:00:54.812
So I guess I caused you
a lot of trouble, huh?

01:00:54.884 --> 01:00:57.352
It's not your fault, um, but...

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.116
I don't think we should spend
any more time together.

01:01:01.124 --> 01:01:02.455
Hey, hey, hey.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:04.853
I don't know, you know...

01:01:06.529 --> 01:01:08.360
seeing you again
after all these years...

01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.894
reminds me of that last
Christmas we spent together.

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:13.128
Scott.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:14.499
Remember?

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:19.739
I remember it was freezing,

01:01:19.809 --> 01:01:21.970
and you had to put
your arms around me.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:24.377
- Yeah.
- No, Scott.

01:01:28.885 --> 01:01:30.750
Paige, come on, okay?

01:01:30.820 --> 01:01:33.311
Letting you go,
biggest mistake of my life.

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:35.380
I lost you...

01:01:36.559 --> 01:01:38.493
and now you're...

01:01:38.561 --> 01:01:41.724
now you're married to a king.
What am I supposed to do with that?

01:01:44.734 --> 01:01:47.134
You're not supposed
to do anything with it.

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.263
You're living
a little girl's dream, Paige.

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:53.604
It's not your dream.
You never wanted any of this.

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:55.303
You wanted to be a doctor,

01:01:55.378 --> 01:01:58.006
and now you've given it up
for some fantasy.

01:01:58.081 --> 01:02:00.515
- It's not you.
- I haven't given anything up.

01:02:03.586 --> 01:02:05.349
Wait a minute.

01:02:05.421 --> 01:02:09.084
Is that... is that... what this
whole thing has been about,

01:02:09.158 --> 01:02:10.420
winning me back?

01:02:13.262 --> 01:02:15.230
I thought you were my friend,

01:02:15.298 --> 01:02:18.131
and you came here
to try and wreck my marriage.

01:02:19.235 --> 01:02:22.363
Scott... why are you here?

01:02:22.438 --> 01:02:24.429
I'm here for you, Paige.

01:02:26.743 --> 01:02:27.869
I love you.

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:29.377
Leave me alone.

01:02:32.615 --> 01:02:34.879
Aah!
Jeez, Paige!

01:02:34.951 --> 01:02:36.179
What's wrong with you?

01:02:36.252 --> 01:02:37.742
You don't understand.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:41.278
No, no. You need
to stay away from me.

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:45.626
Paige! Paige, I'm sorry!

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:51.960
Well done.

01:02:53.803 --> 01:02:56.738
Hey, I'm done.
That's all you're getting from me.

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.735
That's all I need.

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:03.468
It's all I need.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.406
Don't catch cold.

01:03:11.487 --> 01:03:12.613
Oliver?

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:14.451
Just be a moment, madam.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.857
Oliver, what happened?

01:03:21.697 --> 01:03:26.100
I believe the king had a few too many...
"mind erasers," I believe they're called.

01:03:26.169 --> 01:03:27.796
I just had a beer.

01:03:30.173 --> 01:03:32.198
He missed his meeting
with the prince.

01:03:32.275 --> 01:03:33.833
The prince was not happy.

01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:35.434
That's not like Eddie at all.

01:03:36.679 --> 01:03:37.839
Thank you for bringing him home.

01:03:37.914 --> 01:03:40.906
It was a pleasure to carry
the leader of my homeland...

01:03:41.984 --> 01:03:43.451
over my shoulder.

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:53.993
Paige, are you cross with me?

01:03:55.531 --> 01:03:57.192
No, honey.

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:00.199
That would be terrible.

01:04:01.704 --> 01:04:04.537
I love you so much, it hurts.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:11.703
I love you too.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.679
Eddie, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.085
Eddie?

01:04:40.009 --> 01:04:41.169
Thank you.

01:04:45.414 --> 01:04:47.006
Hi.

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.414
Merry Christmas Eve.

01:04:49.919 --> 01:04:53.685
Paige, why does my head hurt?

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:55.621
You drank too much last night.

01:04:55.691 --> 01:04:57.090
You want to sit?

01:04:58.094 --> 01:04:59.254
Yes.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:11.599
I'm sorry.

01:05:12.141 --> 01:05:13.267
Me too.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.502
No, it's my fault.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:16.374
I shouldn't have gone off on
your friend like that.

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:18.436
I was stupid and...

01:05:20.449 --> 01:05:21.643
jealous.

01:05:24.120 --> 01:05:25.917
Eddie, I have
to tell you something,

01:05:25.988 --> 01:05:28.582
and you're not going to like it.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.086
Okay.

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:34.122
This is kind of awkward.

01:05:35.131 --> 01:05:36.325
Bad awkward?

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.832
Not good.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.458
Maybe bad.

01:05:41.537 --> 01:05:42.970
Good morning, Your Majesties.

01:05:43.039 --> 01:05:45.439
Oliver, will you just
give us a minute, please?

01:05:45.508 --> 01:05:47.533
Sir, the prime minister's here.

01:05:47.610 --> 01:05:50.738
Here? In Belavia here?

01:05:50.813 --> 01:05:53.577
Yes, and he would like to speak
to you at your earliest convenience.

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:59.287
Fine. Could you tell him that
I'll meet him in the hotel library

01:05:59.355 --> 01:06:01.380
in 15 minutes.

01:06:02.692 --> 01:06:05.286
Paige, I'm really sorry.
I'm going to have to go and see him.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:07.329
Who knows what he's up to.

01:06:07.396 --> 01:06:09.762
Can we talk about this later?

01:06:09.832 --> 01:06:11.459
Yeah. Yeah.

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:12.694
Okay.

01:06:16.005 --> 01:06:17.131
It's not...

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:20.205
<i>bad</i> bad, is it?

01:06:22.011 --> 01:06:23.273
Well, we'll talk later.

01:06:33.356 --> 01:06:35.756
Thank you for seeing me,
Your Majesty.

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:39.158
John, I hope you're not here to try
and make me change my mind.

01:06:39.228 --> 01:06:43.221
I've already persuaded a number
of the legislators to join my cause.

01:06:43.299 --> 01:06:44.789
Yes, I'm well aware,

01:06:44.867 --> 01:06:48.166
but there may be other factors
you might want to consider.

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:49.670
May I sit?

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:00.640
- What is this?
- It's a book.

01:07:00.716 --> 01:07:02.877
A tell-all, I believe they call it.

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.084
It doesn't paint your young bride
in the best light.

01:07:09.892 --> 01:07:11.359
How did you get this?

01:07:12.895 --> 01:07:14.795
You should read it, really.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.664
We just added an especially juicy
chapter following last night's events.

01:07:18.734 --> 01:07:20.326
It's great stuff,

01:07:20.403 --> 01:07:22.371
complete with pictures too.

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:25.839
There's even a great one of you
asleep on a barroom floor.

01:07:25.908 --> 01:07:27.239
But this one...

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.542
is my favorite.

01:07:43.859 --> 01:07:45.190
What do you want?

01:07:46.262 --> 01:07:48.230
Drop this issue.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:50.993
Go honeymoon
in the tropics as planned,

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:55.060
or your dirty laundry will become
a number-one bestseller.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:57.298
Are you ready for that?

01:07:57.373 --> 01:07:59.034
Is your queen?

01:08:17.827 --> 01:08:20.591
Uh, it's over. We're leaving.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:22.221
Why?

01:08:24.300 --> 01:08:26.063
We lost the fight.

01:08:26.734 --> 01:08:27.962
Eddie, what happened?

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.636
Better question...

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.738
What happened
with Scott last night?

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:46.983
He... kissed me.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.490
For the record, Paige...

01:08:52.528 --> 01:08:54.553
someone kissing you

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:58.087
falls under the category of <i>bad</i> bad.

01:08:58.968 --> 01:09:01.232
Eddie, you don't think that l...

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:02.462
What?

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:05.939
Kissed him back? Did you?

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.942
No.

01:09:08.010 --> 01:09:09.841
No, of course not.

01:09:12.348 --> 01:09:13.508
So it was a...

01:09:15.350 --> 01:09:16.578
a one-way kiss?

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.185
Yeah, I would say so.

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:23.919
I slapped him.

01:09:26.862 --> 01:09:28.022
He's, um...

01:09:30.032 --> 01:09:31.795
he's written a book, Paige.

01:09:35.703 --> 01:09:38.798
A tell-all about the two of you,

01:09:38.874 --> 01:09:42.366
complete with a picture
of him kissing you...

01:09:43.879 --> 01:09:45.038
on our honeymoon.

01:09:45.113 --> 01:09:47.479
That's... this is why
we've got to go...

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.816
before this book comes out,
courtesy of Polonius.

01:09:53.555 --> 01:09:54.716
Polonius.

01:09:58.394 --> 01:10:00.487
Eddie, we didn't
do anything wrong.

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:02.497
Oh, that's not how it looks.

01:10:02.565 --> 01:10:03.725
This book would...

01:10:05.568 --> 01:10:07.559
embarrass the Crown.

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:11.331
No. It would embarrass me.

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:18.808
You are the Crown.

01:10:18.881 --> 01:10:21.509
Paige, you are
the queen of Denmark.

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:22.744
Yes.

01:10:23.752 --> 01:10:28.519
And as queen, I will not run away
from slander, and neither should you.

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.183
It's not me I'm worried about.

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:32.056
I'm not going anywhere.

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:34.589
Excuse me?

01:10:34.663 --> 01:10:35.789
You heard me.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:40.758
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:45.604
In fact, I have been wronged
by someone I thought was a friend.

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.675
I won't back down.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:49.370
I can't.

01:10:49.445 --> 01:10:52.278
I'm not going to pretend
to be someone I'm not.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:54.408
What do you mean?

01:10:54.483 --> 01:10:57.179
Just because Scott and Polonius
say something is true,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:59.585
you think people will believe it.

01:11:00.623 --> 01:11:02.716
Well, I don't.

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:05.157
People know me better than that,

01:11:05.227 --> 01:11:08.219
and they should know that
somebody's trying to blackmail us.

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.132
Sit down.

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.435
Hey, hey.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:24.105
Never for a moment believe
that I would want you to change.

01:11:26.615 --> 01:11:28.310
You're the woman I married.

01:11:30.152 --> 01:11:33.417
You're the girl I want,
and you will be...

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.256
You <i>are</i> a brilliant queen.

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.495
Then let's go forward.

01:11:48.504 --> 01:11:51.439
I can take a little
embarrassment if you can,

01:11:51.507 --> 01:11:53.532
if I know it's the right thing.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.235
It is the right thing, isn't it?

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.711
Yes.

01:11:59.181 --> 01:12:00.512
I love you...

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.144
Paige Morgan.

01:12:04.219 --> 01:12:05.811
I love you.

01:12:17.366 --> 01:12:18.799
Three hours till the vote.

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.363
There he is.

01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:25.966
Scott!

01:12:27.343 --> 01:12:28.605
You and I need to talk.

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:29.803
Uh...

01:12:31.213 --> 01:12:33.010
I got a plane to catch.

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.674
- Call the prince.
- A press conference. I'm on it!

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.051
Hey!

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.727
You don't mind, do you?

01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:51.693
Thank you.

01:12:53.569 --> 01:12:55.002
Now...

01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:58.403
driving I <i>can</i> do.

01:13:56.298 --> 01:13:57.731
All right!

01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:00.234
Now, I didn't want it
to have to come to this,

01:14:00.302 --> 01:14:03.931
but I'm going to have to show you
how we take care of things back home.

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.530
Ugh!

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.438
Aaahhh!

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:10.444
Actually, we Danes
are quite fond of pugilism.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:18.183
The conference
is at the castle in an hour.

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:19.584
The reporters are on their way.

01:14:21.490 --> 01:14:23.481
I am really sorry.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.926
I don't want to hear you
say you're sorry.

01:14:30.098 --> 01:14:32.965
Was this Polonius' idea
or yours?

01:14:33.035 --> 01:14:35.060
A bit of both.

01:14:35.137 --> 01:14:36.627
I've been writing it for a while.

01:14:39.174 --> 01:14:42.109
It was just about Paige
and me at high school.

01:14:42.177 --> 01:14:44.042
I needed the money.

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.872
But then the prime minister
contacted me.

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:52.352
I guess he was,
uh, fishing for dirt.

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:57.382
On you, Paige.

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.721
On me?

01:14:58.794 --> 01:14:59.988
Yeah.

01:15:00.062 --> 01:15:01.324
I, uh...

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:04.726
I told him about the book.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:07.234
He said he could get it published...

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:10.194
if I just, um...

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:13.364
embellished things...

01:15:14.376 --> 01:15:15.468
a little bit.

01:15:16.879 --> 01:15:18.312
If you lied, you mean.

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:21.508
Hey, I told you,
I needed the money, okay?

01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.380
Paige...

01:15:27.422 --> 01:15:30.391
my family's farm is going under.

01:15:35.163 --> 01:15:37.154
So, anyway, then he says, uh,

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.666
"Oh, we're probably going to need
some pictures to go with the book."

01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:42.102
When you guys came to Belavia,

01:15:42.170 --> 01:15:44.468
he gave me the scoop
and flew me out here.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.538
I <i>was</i> in Lithuania,

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:49.600
but I had no idea
it involved this oil thing,

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:53.170
and I certainly didn't know that
that Oliver creep was involved until...

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:57.643
Well, uh, until I did.

01:16:00.088 --> 01:16:01.555
Well, he fooled us too.

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:07.228
So what are we going to do
about this?

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.034
You're sure
the prince understands?

01:16:21.109 --> 01:16:23.475
I've explained everything.
You'll speak first, then Scott.

01:16:23.545 --> 01:16:25.877
Never been on this end
of a press conference before.

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:27.313
Just tell the truth, okay,

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:29.373
that Polonius brought you here,
he told you what to do,

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:31.715
and then paid you to write
a salacious exposé on the queen.

01:16:31.787 --> 01:16:35.052
Hey! It's my family's farm, okay?
It's all we've got.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.921
Scott! We've been friends
for a long time.

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.517
Our parents are friends.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.563
We cared a lot
about each other at one point.

01:16:41.630 --> 01:16:45.066
If that means anything to you,
you need to make this right.

01:16:45.133 --> 01:16:46.760
We will do everything
we can for your family,

01:16:46.835 --> 01:16:49.599
but right now, this
country's future is at stake.

01:16:56.011 --> 01:16:57.376
Your Majesty.

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.812
You're supposed
to be on a plane.

01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:01.911
Change of plans.

01:17:01.984 --> 01:17:05.112
We're not running away
because of your lies.

01:17:05.687 --> 01:17:08.781
So you call a press conference
and have Mr. All-American

01:17:08.857 --> 01:17:12.224
spill his guts about
the evil prime minister.

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.989
Is that about right?

01:17:15.497 --> 01:17:16.794
Something like that, yes.

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:18.457
Now, if you'll excuse us,

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.091
the reporters are waiting,

01:17:20.168 --> 01:17:22.193
as is our Parliament.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:32.743
You don't expect me to allow you
to tarnish my reputation, do you?

01:17:32.814 --> 01:17:34.714
You'd draw a sword on your king?

01:17:34.783 --> 01:17:35.977
Well...

01:17:38.020 --> 01:17:39.988
you will not pass.

01:17:40.055 --> 01:17:42.182
The reporters are right inside.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:46.791
Yes, and Oliver has his instructions.

01:17:46.862 --> 01:17:48.489
Eddie!

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.462
You will not be attending
this press conference.

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:56.895
Like hell he won't!

01:17:56.972 --> 01:17:58.872
Aah!

01:18:02.878 --> 01:18:05.176
Paige... go to the press conference.

01:18:05.247 --> 01:18:06.009
Eddie.

01:18:06.915 --> 01:18:08.212
Go.

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.409
I've got it.

01:18:10.218 --> 01:18:12.152
You're a young fool.

01:18:14.890 --> 01:18:16.050
And you, sir...

01:18:17.059 --> 01:18:19.186
are an old fool.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:28.833
You have no idea
what it takes to govern a country.

01:18:28.904 --> 01:18:31.395
What? With lies and deceit?

01:18:42.584 --> 01:18:45.212
My people will believe
what I tell them to believe.

01:19:03.305 --> 01:19:06.331
The people will believe the truth.

01:19:06.408 --> 01:19:07.466
Aah!

01:19:18.954 --> 01:19:21.115
Gentlemen. Ladies.

01:19:21.189 --> 01:19:23.214
Quiet, please.

01:19:23.291 --> 01:19:27.022
In 20 minutes, we shall adjourn
to the chamber for the vote.

01:19:27.095 --> 01:19:30.087
Thank you all for attending
this special session of the Folketing

01:19:30.165 --> 01:19:31.496
during your holidays.

01:19:36.638 --> 01:19:37.832
Come on, it's this way.

01:19:37.906 --> 01:19:39.396
No, it's this way.

01:19:46.982 --> 01:19:48.142
I'm not done yet.

01:19:57.492 --> 01:19:59.722
I run this country.

01:19:59.795 --> 01:20:02.195
You are a figurehead.

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:06.092
I am the head of state.

01:20:27.889 --> 01:20:29.686
The monarch is leaving.

01:20:29.758 --> 01:20:31.248
There's something going on.

01:20:31.326 --> 01:20:33.817
The king had better not be
standing him up again.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:36.329
Thank you.
Thank you all for coming.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:40.468
As you know, King Edvard
and Queen Paige of Denmark

01:20:40.535 --> 01:20:42.833
came to Belavia to impede progress,

01:20:42.904 --> 01:20:47.398
to stop what could be a great
economic boon for both our countries.

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:50.641
You cannot defeat me!

01:20:54.349 --> 01:20:57.011
I can, and I will.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.818
Information has come to our attention.

01:21:00.889 --> 01:21:04.347
I warn you that this material
is sordid in nature.

01:21:04.426 --> 01:21:05.757
Stop!

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.157
It's the king...

01:21:08.230 --> 01:21:10.164
and the prime minister?

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:11.358
Eddie!

01:21:11.433 --> 01:21:12.957
Wait, I have this manuscript.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:14.865
It's really very saucy!

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:27.673
Enough!

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:34.084
Do you yield?

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.453
Your Majesty,
a question for the <i>Post.</i>

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:49.192
That was impressive.

01:21:49.271 --> 01:21:51.432
Don't act so surprised.
We're on TV.

01:21:52.807 --> 01:21:54.331
I'm not surprised.

01:21:55.944 --> 01:21:57.377
You're my hero.

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:27.307
May I have your attention, please.

01:22:47.696 --> 01:22:49.220
Attention, please.

01:22:49.297 --> 01:22:51.094
His Majesty is speaking.

01:22:51.166 --> 01:22:53.964
The prime minister
has attempted to coerce

01:22:54.035 --> 01:22:55.764
and blackmail us,

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:58.203
even tarnish the queen's good name,

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:02.972
all in an effort to steal and destroy
the resources of Belavia.

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.877
<i>I speak directly to Parliament</i>

01:23:05.947 --> 01:23:09.508
<i>when I ask you to vote down</i>
<i>the measure before you.</i>

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:13.715
This kingdom
and its natural resources

01:23:13.788 --> 01:23:17.280
belong to its own people...

01:23:18.460 --> 01:23:21.190
and any attempt
to usurp them is a crime.

01:23:22.230 --> 01:23:24.824
<i>Denmark will help Belavia,</i>

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:27.561
<i>but not by taking... by giving,</i>

01:23:27.635 --> 01:23:31.196
<i>by developing</i>
<i>its greatest assets, its people,</i>

01:23:31.272 --> 01:23:32.671
its vast forests,

01:23:32.741 --> 01:23:34.732
<i>and the unique wildlife they harbor.</i>

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:41.714
Queen Paige and I will work tirelessly
to promote the wonders of this country.

01:23:41.783 --> 01:23:42.977
And so...

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:46.078
<i>on this Christmas Eve...</i>

01:23:47.389 --> 01:23:51.348
<i>I urge you to remember what is</i>
<i>important to the Belavian people</i>

01:23:51.426 --> 01:23:52.859
<i>and to Denmark.</i>

01:23:53.862 --> 01:23:57.491
I urge you to vote
with your heads...

01:23:58.666 --> 01:24:00.497
and with your hearts.

01:24:02.871 --> 01:24:03.895
Thank you, sir.

01:24:10.745 --> 01:24:13.737
And now, Scott Alberson
would like to say a few words.

01:24:13.815 --> 01:24:14.941
Scott?

01:24:24.259 --> 01:24:25.886
Hi.

01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:27.325
Scott Alberson.

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:30.758
I wrote this book.

01:24:32.534 --> 01:24:34.001
None of it is true.

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:37.028
Oh, yeah, and I'm a big jerk.

01:24:38.106 --> 01:24:39.232
Questions?

01:24:41.109 --> 01:24:42.371
Thank you.

01:24:43.978 --> 01:24:45.172
Soren?

01:24:45.246 --> 01:24:48.340
Pardon me, Your Majesty,
I didn't mean to interrupt your...

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:51.078
<i>relaxing holiday.</i>
<i>I thought you should know</i>

01:24:51.152 --> 01:24:52.449
that Parliament has voted.

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:57.617
It's a landslide.
Belavia is safe.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:24:59.684
Eddie!

01:24:59.761 --> 01:25:01.228
- What?
- We did it.

01:25:01.296 --> 01:25:02.456
- We did it?
- We won.

01:25:03.898 --> 01:25:05.695
- We did it?
- We did it.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:07.997
- 
- Hello?

01:25:11.139 --> 01:25:12.299
Hello?

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:18.340
<i>I'm still here.</i>

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.041
Yes?

01:25:22.117 --> 01:25:24.779
<i>Yes, if I may, I wanted to say</i>
<i>something poignant,</i>

01:25:24.853 --> 01:25:26.343
and here it is...

01:25:28.156 --> 01:25:29.646
you did this, the two of you...

01:25:30.692 --> 01:25:32.159
<i>and I'm very proud of you.</i>

01:25:32.227 --> 01:25:33.922
Thank you, Soren.

01:25:33.995 --> 01:25:35.155
You're welcome.

01:25:36.664 --> 01:25:37.858
Now...

01:25:37.932 --> 01:25:39.661
may I speak with the king, please?

01:25:39.734 --> 01:25:40.860
Yes.

01:25:42.370 --> 01:25:43.803
Hello, Soren?

01:25:44.472 --> 01:25:45.632
Really?

01:25:45.707 --> 01:25:47.334
Well, I will let her know.

01:25:48.343 --> 01:25:49.674
Thank you, Soren.

01:25:51.179 --> 01:25:52.612
Let me know what?

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:55.547
Nothing. Just got
your Christmas present.

01:25:55.617 --> 01:25:56.777
Oh.

01:26:00.021 --> 01:26:03.115
So, uh, I'm going to take off.

01:26:03.191 --> 01:26:04.624
I'm sorry.

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:06.159
Really.

01:26:07.795 --> 01:26:08.819
Okay.

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:11.991
Scott, you did the right thing...
eventually.

01:26:13.201 --> 01:26:16.500
You're a good guy.
You just need to remember that.

01:26:18.173 --> 01:26:19.868
Quite a girl you got there.

01:26:20.875 --> 01:26:22.399
Yeah. I know.

01:26:22.477 --> 01:26:25.537
Oh, by the way, I spoke
to the governor of Wisconsin...

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.205
who spoke to your mother's bank.

01:26:28.283 --> 01:26:30.649
You did? You did that?

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:34.449
They're going to help you work out
a more reasonable payment plan.

01:26:34.522 --> 01:26:36.649
Everything's going to be fine.

01:26:36.724 --> 01:26:39.124
Thank you.
Thank you. I'm, uh...

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:40.889
I'm going to try and earn this.

01:26:40.962 --> 01:26:42.054
Good.

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:43.654
Thank you.

01:26:43.731 --> 01:26:45.221
Come here, you.

01:27:00.915 --> 01:27:02.678
Okay.

01:27:11.926 --> 01:27:13.917
Merry Christmas.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:15.690
Look at you, Mr. Romance.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:19.221
Well, this is Christmas Eve,
and a particularly special one.

01:27:19.300 --> 01:27:20.494
What do you mean?

01:27:25.306 --> 01:27:27.035
Your Christmas present.

01:27:29.978 --> 01:27:31.946
I figured you'd need a new one...

01:27:33.281 --> 01:27:35.374
for your new job.

01:27:35.450 --> 01:27:36.712
What?

01:27:36.784 --> 01:27:38.718
Soren took a call
from the chief resident

01:27:38.786 --> 01:27:40.720
at Copenhagen Hospital
this afternoon.

01:27:42.323 --> 01:27:45.759
I hear doctors have
a very exhausting first year.

01:27:46.761 --> 01:27:48.126
But do you think I should?

01:27:49.664 --> 01:27:54.294
I could put it off...
you know, focus on being a queen.

01:27:54.369 --> 01:27:55.893
Is that what you want?

01:27:59.207 --> 01:28:00.640
No.

01:28:04.012 --> 01:28:06.947
I don't think there's
only one way to be a queen.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.846
This is my way.

01:28:10.918 --> 01:28:13.580
Well, at least we had a relaxing
break before you start work.

01:28:13.655 --> 01:28:17.318
I had a wonderful time,
a wonderful honeymoon.

01:28:21.329 --> 01:28:22.887
Merry Christmas, Paige.

01:28:23.965 --> 01:28:26.007
Merry Christmas,
Eddie.

01:28:51.292 --> 01:28:52.418
Shall we?

01:28:53.528 --> 01:28:54.688
I think so.
