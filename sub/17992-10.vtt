and Hip Hop: Hollywood".

00:04.304 --> 00:05.572
{\an8}You're out of line.

00:05.638 --> 00:09.576
{\an8}[bleep] the [bleep] out of here.

00:09.642 --> 00:11.578
{\an8}I brought you your [bleep]
back, whatever you wanted,

00:11.644 --> 00:12.879
{\an8}your Monistat.

00:12.946 --> 00:13.880
{\an8}I'm tripping.

00:13.947 --> 00:16.049
{\an8}You don't remember
us being together?

00:16.116 --> 00:17.317
{\an8}We wasn't ever
together like that.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.818
{\an8}So, maybe I'm delusional.

00:18.885 --> 00:21.121
{\an8}You are a little bit delusional.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.657
{\an8}The things I did to Teairra
was out of me being spiteful.

00:24.724 --> 00:27.360
{\an8}I believe you really
owe her an apology.

00:27.427 --> 00:30.430
{\an8}And you brought along
another friend, Miss Nia Riley.

00:30.497 --> 00:31.831
{\an8}Hello.

00:31.898 --> 00:33.466
{\an8}You also date Soulja Boy.

00:33.533 --> 00:34.968
{\an8}How long have you
guys been dating?

00:35.034 --> 00:36.536
{\an8}It has been eight years
and it has been a lot

00:36.603 --> 00:38.438
{\an8}of back and forth.

00:38.505 --> 00:39.906
{\an8}I asked you what you do on tour.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.242
{\an8}What do you want me to say,
I [bleep] everybody on tour.

00:42.308 --> 00:45.111
{\an8}I'm leaving for Brazil like
tomorrow, I'm going to be

00:45.178 --> 00:47.113
{\an8}gone for two weeks.

00:47.180 --> 00:48.648
{\an8}You're worried about
the wrong [bleep].

00:48.715 --> 00:50.150
{\an8}You're supposed to be worried
about your [bleep] records.

00:50.216 --> 00:51.151
{\an8}What's up with that?

00:51.217 --> 00:52.652
{\an8}This is the Berg record?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.587
{\an8}The infamous Berg
record, finally.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.157
{\an8}Well, the beat is sick.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.591
{\an8}So, you ain't [bleep] with that?

00:58.658 --> 00:59.859
{\an8}No, it's a wrap for that.

00:59.926 --> 01:02.695
{\an8}You can't use any
of my material.

01:02.762 --> 01:04.964
{\an8}You're mad about a [bleep]
she don't want, I don't want

01:05.031 --> 01:06.166
{\an8}and don't want you.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.801
{\an8}Shut the [bleep] up, bitch!

01:07.867 --> 01:09.035
{\an8}She played me the record.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.837
{\an8}And what were your
thoughts and opinion on it?

01:10.904 --> 01:12.205
{\an8}I love the track.

01:12.272 --> 01:15.041
{\an8}I did think Hazel's
verse was a little struggly.

01:15.108 --> 01:17.610
{\an8}I know you're an artist as
well, I think you should try

01:17.677 --> 01:20.346
{\an8}and attack the song if
you feel it like that.

01:20.413 --> 01:22.015
{\an8}Let's start kicking
your labor into gear.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.316
{\an8}About that time.

01:23.383 --> 01:26.753
{\an8}Okay, let's do this.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.456
{\an8}[baby crying]

01:29.522 --> 01:39.499

{\an5}♪♪

01:49.609 --> 01:59.185
{\an5}♪♪

02:03.423 --> 02:04.190
{\an5}Oh, he's so handsome.

02:04.257 --> 02:05.425
Look at him.

02:05.492 --> 02:08.161
Couple of days old and he's
already swaging, like his daddy.

02:08.228 --> 02:10.062
Ha, ha.

02:10.128 --> 02:12.999
{\an5}Ladies and
gentlemen, my son is here.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.102
{\an5}Oh, I'm so happy.

02:16.169 --> 02:20.907
I named him Mega because that's
exactly what this is, it's mega.

02:20.974 --> 02:25.278
I never knew I could love one
little person so much so fast.

02:25.345 --> 02:28.348
And the icing on the cake,
people, is that all the women

02:28.414 --> 02:30.950
in my life are
finally getting along.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.652
You see what a baby can do?

02:32.719 --> 02:35.455
I'm not saying have a baby,
but I'm saying life is good,

02:35.522 --> 02:36.456
life is good.

02:36.523 --> 02:39.559
Look at all that hair.

02:39.626 --> 02:43.096
{\an5}I really had serious concerns
about Apryl becoming a mother

02:43.162 --> 02:44.664
because there's a lot of
sacrifices that you

02:44.731 --> 02:45.899
have to make.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.001
But I really do
appreciate Apryl, though.

02:48.067 --> 02:51.404
Between the 36 hours of labor,
the crazy mother,

02:51.471 --> 02:53.006
she hung in there.

02:53.072 --> 02:55.909
And I couldn't wait to
become a grandmother.

02:55.975 --> 02:59.145
You know, I'm just sad your
mom isn't in the same state.

02:59.212 --> 03:01.548
She was having a hard time
with me going into labor.

03:01.614 --> 03:02.849
I'm sure she was.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.985
{\an5}Being a mother is
challenging, it really is.

03:06.052 --> 03:09.589
{\an5}But I'm the happiest I've
ever been in my entire life.

03:09.656 --> 03:13.593
Miss Leslie, surprisingly,
has been so supportive and

03:13.660 --> 03:15.495
it's exactly what I need
right now since my mom

03:15.562 --> 03:17.063
is still in Chicago.

03:17.130 --> 03:18.031
My mom didn't raise me.

03:18.097 --> 03:19.265
Okay.

03:19.332 --> 03:21.200
So, you know, like you and Omari
are super close and y'all've

03:21.267 --> 03:24.237
been best friends all of your
lives, you know, me and my mom,

03:24.304 --> 03:25.171
we're not like that.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.573
My mom was really
my grandmother.

03:26.639 --> 03:29.709
The relationship that I have
with my mom is really stale.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.879
She doesn't say that she loves
her kids, she doesn't hug us.

03:32.946 --> 03:35.548
She doesn't show us
very much affection.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.917
And I really just
want love for my mother.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.587
My mom, she doesn't go in
depth with certain questions.

03:40.653 --> 03:44.157
If I had a daughter and she was
pregnant, I would say, you know,

03:44.223 --> 03:45.391
how are you feeling?

03:45.458 --> 03:48.561
Are you telling me that you
didn't speak to your mom about

03:48.628 --> 03:50.496
your pregnancy your whole time?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.098
She's never not once asked me.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.600
I understand.

03:53.666 --> 03:55.068
I wanted the
support from my mom.

03:55.134 --> 03:57.904
That's why when me and you got
into our situation it was really

03:57.971 --> 04:00.773
tough for me because I
felt like, you know,

04:00.840 --> 04:02.442
you were supposed to be
there for me here.

04:02.508 --> 04:06.045
And she didn't support me,
I don't feel like

04:06.112 --> 04:07.447
she supported me.

04:07.513 --> 04:12.352
Apryl felt abandoned by her mom
when she had to stay with her

04:12.418 --> 04:14.721
grandmother as a young child.

04:14.787 --> 04:16.689
And it didn't get any better
when she moved back

04:16.755 --> 04:18.491
with her when she 11.

04:18.558 --> 04:22.328
Apryl feels like she doesn't
know her own mother sometimes.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.298
But I know that a
baby can change that.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.167
Omari has to remind me a lot
that your mom loves you

04:28.234 --> 04:31.838
and I'll be like, "Sometimes
I don't feel like that."

04:31.904 --> 04:35.642
Sorry.

04:35.708 --> 04:39.779
I don't really like
talking about it.

04:39.846 --> 04:44.384
I don't know, it's just like
I'm a mom now, you know

04:44.450 --> 04:47.887
what I'm saying, I don't want to
be who my mom was to me.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.489
I'm hard, you know how I am.

04:49.555 --> 04:50.757
You've had to help me.

04:50.823 --> 04:54.460
You've had to mold me into being
better and that's why I love you

04:54.527 --> 04:56.062
so much is you've helped me.

04:56.129 --> 05:00.333
But it's like now I
need my mom to help me.

05:00.400 --> 05:03.236
So, my mom is going to be here
in a couple of days and I do not

05:03.302 --> 05:05.071
know how this is going to go.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.407
I just need to know that she's
going to be involved in Mega's

05:07.473 --> 05:09.475
life, that she's going to
be involved in my life.

05:09.542 --> 05:13.413
And if she's not, she just
can't be a part of it at all.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.882
I know what Apryl
has been through.

05:15.948 --> 05:19.619
I definitely feel like there
are some things that

05:19.686 --> 05:20.887
should be answered.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.388
You all might not know how to
communicate together,

05:22.455 --> 05:25.058
but when you have that
conversation with your mom,

05:25.124 --> 05:28.895
like pour your heart out.

05:28.961 --> 05:31.230
It's just hard to
communicate with her, you know.

05:31.297 --> 05:33.800
I don't know if I'm
going to get cussed out.

05:33.866 --> 05:35.902
If she does go there,
she doesn't know how

05:35.968 --> 05:37.070
to respond to you.

05:37.136 --> 05:39.605
She doesn't know
what to say just yet.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.374
This is your daughter.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.477
I know that.

05:44.544 --> 05:47.346
That's my daughter.

05:59.025 --> 06:00.993
{\an5}Nia said she had some things to
talk to me about, so I came

06:01.060 --> 06:03.463
{\an5}to spend some time with
her and Cammie Cam.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.298
Soulja's out on tour, we both
got some things we need

things that have been

going on in my life.

tuition and Ray fired me.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.241
Fired you before?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.409
I've been fired three times.

06:16.476 --> 06:17.110
Oh.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.211
You need to talk to him.

06:18.277 --> 06:19.779
I don't want to talk to him
because I don't know if

06:19.846 --> 06:22.582
I'm talking to Willie or if
I'm talking to Ray J.

06:22.648 --> 06:23.883

know Morgan will be

really supportive.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.028
But you're good though?

06:36.095 --> 06:37.196
You're good and you're good?

06:37.263 --> 06:40.233
I'm okay for the most part.

06:40.299 --> 06:44.237
I mean, don't -- I know
you're going to give me

06:44.303 --> 06:46.639

06:46.706 --> 06:49.008
I think I'm pregnant.

06:49.075 --> 06:52.578
But I haven't gotten a chance
to talk to him about it yet.

06:52.645 --> 06:58.484
So, you know, like we're mothers
and we know we're pregnant

06:58.551 --> 07:00.586
before the test even
knows we're pregnant.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.356
Exactly and it's like the
same thing going on when I was

07:03.422 --> 07:07.293
pregnant with Cam, so I'm like,
"Why is this happening again?

07:07.360 --> 07:08.694

Pretty much telling me
what I needed to know.

I'm happy for Nia,
but she doesn't seem

07:18.437 --> 07:19.806
too excited herself.

07:19.872 --> 07:22.575
I know they're just starting to
figure things out and now

07:22.642 --> 07:23.409
she's pregnant.

07:23.476 --> 07:24.277
Did you take a pregnancy test?

07:24.343 --> 07:25.545
I did.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.079
And what did it say?

07:27.146 --> 07:29.115
It was positive.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.117
So you said you think you're
pregnant and you are pregnant,

07:31.184 --> 07:33.386
what do you mean?

07:33.452 --> 07:35.188
I feel like I'm
not accepting it.

07:35.254 --> 07:38.224
Dre and I thought when I
finally did have a baby,

07:38.291 --> 07:42.862
it would be his, but I had a
baby and he's not the father.

07:42.929 --> 07:44.764
And he's really good with
Cam and he's supportive,

07:44.831 --> 07:47.533
but I don't know if we're
ready to have a baby.

07:47.600 --> 07:50.469
And with him being all the way
in another country, I don't know

07:50.536 --> 07:53.506
how to tell him and I don't
know how he's going to react.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.208
We're not married, I don't
know what will happen with

07:55.274 --> 07:57.009
us having a baby.

07:57.076 --> 07:59.145
You know how that goes.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.214
He doesn't know
about any of this.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.448
He's not here.

08:02.515 --> 08:03.449
Where's he at?

08:03.516 --> 08:05.051
He's in Brazil right now.

I know, I try not to spaz out
and send evil text messages

08:08.421 --> 08:11.390
like, "Why haven't you
called me or texted me all day?"

08:11.457 --> 08:12.859
Time difference, girl.

08:12.925 --> 08:13.759
I know.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.194
I'm dealing with it.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.195
It's hard.

08:16.262 --> 08:17.196
You should definitely
still try and tell him.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.297
Like FaceTime him though.

08:18.364 --> 08:21.000
It's weird for me to
do that on the phone.

Don't be sad.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.203
{\an5}Only problem is it's the same
song he repossessed from

08:57.270 --> 08:58.971
{\an5}whack ass rapper Hazel.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.841
But after Hazel showed her
entire fake ass at my billboard

09:01.908 --> 09:04.510
unveiling party, that bitch
don't deserve my loyalty.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.480
Um, no, the song
is mine, thank you.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.849
So, damn, this is what
boss bitches do, huh?

09:09.916 --> 09:13.452
{\an5}Originally I gave this track to
Hazel to get her off my bumper

09:13.519 --> 09:17.456
{\an5}and she comes back with this
autobiography of her feelings

09:17.523 --> 09:19.091
and four-page letters.

09:19.158 --> 09:21.627
I don't know what the [bleep] is
going on with Hazel right now,

09:21.694 --> 09:24.196
but I figure I'll dust this
record off and give it to Masika

09:24.263 --> 09:28.267
because me giving aspiring
singers like a chance and

09:28.334 --> 09:31.304
new records keep my
pentagon in capacity.

09:31.370 --> 09:34.640
But I got my all white
birthday extravaganza coming up.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.043
Maybe Masika will give me
the greatest gift of all.

09:37.109 --> 09:38.311
You know what that is.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.880
This is like night and day
from what that record was.

09:40.947 --> 09:43.282
When she hears this she's
going to lose her mind,

09:43.349 --> 09:44.550
her wig going to fall off,
it's going to be bad.

09:44.617 --> 09:49.255
The crazy thing is I invited her
to the all white extravaganza.

09:49.322 --> 09:52.258
Just extend the invite because I
want her to know that you're not

09:52.325 --> 09:55.227
my girl, maybe you should see me
in action with some other chicks

09:55.294 --> 09:57.430
or whatever and then you'll
get it through your head,

09:57.496 --> 09:59.432
because I'm dealing
with a fatal attraction.

09:59.498 --> 10:02.668
Maybe her coming to my all white
extravaganza and seeing me with

10:02.735 --> 10:07.239
these new 21s will let her
know it's a wrap for you, Hazel.

10:07.306 --> 10:09.508
If she's coming to the party,
it might be best that I don't.

10:09.575 --> 10:10.776
What?

10:10.843 --> 10:12.411
I know you're not one for the
gossip, so I didn't even tell

10:12.478 --> 10:13.312
you what happened.

10:13.379 --> 10:14.680
What?

10:14.747 --> 10:17.183
You know, I had my
billboard launch party.

10:17.249 --> 10:20.052
Bitch going to walk in and she's
like, "Hey, what's up with these

10:20.119 --> 10:22.021
Instagram pictures
of you and Berg?"

10:22.088 --> 10:23.823
And I'm like, "What the
[bleep], he's my friend."

10:23.889 --> 10:25.458
She's like, "Well,
you [bleep] my man."

10:25.524 --> 10:28.594
I said, "One, I'm
not [bleep] Berg.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.797
Two, Berg ain't
your [bleep] man."

10:31.864 --> 10:33.632
How delusional can Hazel be?

10:33.699 --> 10:35.534
I've already been
up front with her.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.270
Told her we're nothing,
she can never be my girl.

10:38.337 --> 10:40.573
And she's getting into
altercations with other people,

10:40.639 --> 10:42.475
calling me her man.

10:42.541 --> 10:44.777
Get this [bleep] bitch
up out of here, please.

10:44.844 --> 10:46.812
Let's give her
something to be upset about.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.214
Like when we get to this party,
like it's going to

10:48.280 --> 10:49.715
be mmm, mmm, mmm.

10:49.782 --> 10:51.717
You're so stupid.

10:51.784 --> 10:52.885
Focus.

10:52.952 --> 10:53.853
I'm focused.

10:53.919 --> 10:55.187
You're my date for my party.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.722
Oh, I would be your date.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.824
You look like it.

10:58.891 --> 11:01.994
In that case I ain't
worried about that bitch.

11:02.061 --> 11:04.964
I think we should go and
wear our matching white,

11:05.031 --> 11:07.299
turn the [bleep] up and
just have a great time.

11:07.366 --> 11:08.667
{\an8}I've been trying to
reach you all day.

11:08.734 --> 11:09.535
{\an8}What?

11:09.602 --> 11:10.336
{\an8}I'm stressed out.

11:10.403 --> 11:11.237
{\an8}You said I'm stressed out?

11:11.303 --> 11:12.471
{\an8}I am.

11:12.538 --> 11:13.406
{\an8}Yeah.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.741
{\an8}All right, whatever, then.

11:15.808 --> 11:16.475
{\an8}I love you.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.343
{\an8}I love you, too.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.477
{\an8}Oh, bae.

11:18.544 --> 11:19.412
{\an8}Damn.

11:19.478 --> 11:20.479
{\an8}Me and you are not nothing.

11:20.546 --> 11:21.414
{\an8}We were friends.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.649
{\an8}Go back to the cave
where you at, baby.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.518
{\an8}I've been hearing a
lot of things about you.

11:25.584 --> 11:27.319
{\an8}You and your girl
are into it right now.

11:27.386 --> 11:28.788
{\an8}Can you at least
tell me who told you?

11:28.854 --> 11:30.256
{\an8}I hear everything
that's been said.

11:30.322 --> 11:31.057
{\an8}How?

11:31.123 --> 11:31.991
{\an8}Because your girl tells me.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.360
♪♪

11:47.473 --> 11:59.852
♪♪

11:59.919 --> 12:01.420
Tonight is an amazing night.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.556
I got everybody
wearing all white.

12:03.622 --> 12:05.057
It's full of beautiful people.

12:05.124 --> 12:08.828
I'm with the most beautiful girl
in the world right now, Masika.

12:08.894 --> 12:10.196
I'm having an amazing time.

12:10.262 --> 12:12.298
I could care less
about any distractions,

12:12.364 --> 12:14.400
anything going on with Hazel.

12:14.467 --> 12:18.270
In fact, maybe Hazel seeing me
and my girl together, it's going

12:18.337 --> 12:21.974
to make her understand what
the [bleep] is really going on.

12:22.041 --> 12:23.509
You know, we here to
celebrate the Berg event,

12:23.576 --> 12:24.677
that's the homie.

12:24.743 --> 12:26.212
I got on all white,
you got on all black.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.713
You're the dark angel today.

12:27.780 --> 12:28.714
What's the problem?

12:28.781 --> 12:29.915
I don't give a [bleep].

12:29.982 --> 12:31.684
So, I see Berg over
there slobbering

12:31.750 --> 12:32.785
all over Masika [bleep].

12:32.852 --> 12:35.187
You know what, I
don't give a [bleep].

12:35.254 --> 12:37.490
{\an5}Them fraud asses
deserve each other.

12:37.556 --> 12:39.191
I showed up to the party with
Ray J tonight because

12:39.258 --> 12:42.695
honestly he might be the
only homie I got left.

12:42.761 --> 12:43.929
Masika, fraud.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.064
Berg, fraud.

12:45.131 --> 12:48.501
And Teairra, she might be
the fraudest of them all.

12:48.567 --> 12:51.303
All these ex-friends of mine
ought to get the [bleep]

12:51.370 --> 12:53.372
away from me and stand 100
feet back because I'm not

12:53.439 --> 12:55.007
having it tonight.

12:55.074 --> 12:56.642
Where's the muppet baby?

12:56.709 --> 12:58.878
Coming in with Ray J.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.247
{\an5}Somehow I think I'm going to
take some sweet pleasure in

13:01.313 --> 13:03.649
{\an5}tormenting Miss Hazel-E tonight.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.184
I know it's just killing
her seeing me and

13:05.251 --> 13:06.719
Bergy Berg together.

13:06.785 --> 13:09.221
But the ultimate is going to be
when boomerang bitch finds out

13:09.288 --> 13:12.158
that the song Berg
repossessed from her is now

13:12.224 --> 13:13.759
in my possession.

13:13.826 --> 13:15.394
Being here is being like
the bigger person or whatever

13:15.461 --> 13:16.662
because he asked me to come.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.098
I will, but the last
time that we hung out.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.432
[bleep] wasn't good.

13:20.499 --> 13:21.567
It wasn't good.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.436
I'm going to take your record.

13:24.503 --> 13:25.771
Fraud moves.

13:25.838 --> 13:27.740
I'm just like, you want to be
my friend, but you keep

13:27.806 --> 13:29.041
doing me bad.

13:29.108 --> 13:31.810
Maybe y'all just need to
let bygones be bygones.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.113
{\an5}Hazel is still angry, I get it.

13:34.180 --> 13:37.449
{\an5}I know love going bad can
make a [bleep] go crazy.

13:37.516 --> 13:40.519
You start talking
[bleep], being disrespectful.

13:40.586 --> 13:43.189
And that's what I did to Teairra
and tonight I want to make

13:43.255 --> 13:45.391
amends with her and I want to
tell her I'm sorry for

13:45.457 --> 13:46.559
what I did.

13:46.625 --> 13:48.227
We all make mistakes.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.628
Be a bigger person tonight.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.931
Watch how much of
a big person I am.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.966
When you do [bleep] wrong, you
want to make sure you can clean

13:54.033 --> 13:58.037
up anything that was wrong or
broken that was your fault.

13:58.103 --> 13:59.905
[applause]

13:59.972 --> 14:01.574
I want brother Berg to come up.

14:01.640 --> 14:03.375
{\an5}Want you to cut the cake, man.

14:03.442 --> 14:04.910
Handclap for my brother Berg.

14:04.977 --> 14:06.645
[applause]

14:06.712 --> 14:08.314
That's right, Hazel, I'm feeding
cake to your man,

14:08.380 --> 14:09.515
who was never your man.

14:09.582 --> 14:11.717
And stay tuned because I have
some more [bleep] for you

14:11.784 --> 14:12.785
to eat tonight.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.887
I want to thank everybody
for coming out tonight.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.489
I got one of my best friends
in the world, Masika, with me.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.725
She amazing.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.227
Masika, I love you.

14:21.293 --> 14:22.294
I love you, too.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.196
Oh, bae.

14:24.263 --> 14:27.466
Okay, so last week TT was
Berg's boo and now he's in

14:27.533 --> 14:29.068
love with Masika?

14:29.134 --> 14:30.402
Really?

14:30.469 --> 14:31.971
Is he going to smash his way
through all the bitches that

14:32.037 --> 14:33.772
have done me wrong?

14:33.839 --> 14:35.241
Whack ass [bleep].

14:35.307 --> 14:36.375
What up, TT?

14:36.442 --> 14:37.676
Hey, Masika.

14:37.743 --> 14:39.044
You're looking so lovely.

14:39.111 --> 14:40.045
Thank you.

14:40.112 --> 14:41.614
I just want to say happy
birthday to one of my

14:41.680 --> 14:45.217
good friends, one of
my closest friends.

14:45.284 --> 14:47.953
Uh, we've been friends
for a long time now,

14:48.020 --> 14:50.089
but tonight I am your date.

14:50.155 --> 14:51.757
Ooh.

14:51.824 --> 14:54.293
Oh, damn, is that
how it's going down?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.128
Happy birthday, Berg.

14:56.195 --> 14:59.865
So, although this is Berg's
birthday, he actually gave me

14:59.932 --> 15:03.802
a gift, so this is a record
that he and I are doing.

15:03.869 --> 15:08.841
So now I just want to
say, happy birthday, Bergy.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.242
Love you, baby.

15:10.309 --> 15:15.180
All right, come on.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.817
Y'all better turn up.

15:18.884 --> 15:21.754
I'm about to literally like
throw up in my mouth

15:21.820 --> 15:23.722
watching that display
between Masika and Berg.

15:23.789 --> 15:26.025
But now I got to stop and
pause because this bitch

15:26.091 --> 15:27.493
is fixing to sing a song.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.295
I know good [bleep] well that

We got one of two options.

15:41.473 --> 15:44.877
I'm either going to bum rush
that stage and tackle this ho,

15:44.943 --> 15:47.780
or I'm going to embarrass this
bitch and let everybody know

Masika come to the studio

16:16.775 --> 16:19.511
as I'm pouring my heart out
on this record and this is

16:19.578 --> 16:21.480
how she repays me.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.482
So, you didn't like my record,
so you gave it to the bitch

16:23.549 --> 16:25.217
that you said don't holler at.

16:25.284 --> 16:26.318
That's one of my best friends.

16:26.385 --> 16:27.186
She's your best friend?

16:27.252 --> 16:28.420
Don't try to get
violent with me.

16:28.487 --> 16:29.621
You went crazy on me.

16:29.688 --> 16:30.689
You got violent with me.

16:30.756 --> 16:32.658
You threw my bag all
across the streets.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.626
I thought we were
friends at the end of the day.

16:34.693 --> 16:37.830
I think our friendship went
out the window with your purse.

16:37.896 --> 16:39.965
You've been betraying this
whole thing like me and

16:40.032 --> 16:41.667
you were something we
were totally not.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.169
You are not nothing.

16:44.236 --> 16:45.671
We were friends.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.740
Stop fronting and stop
frauding these streets.

16:47.806 --> 16:50.275
You coming to my party
with this type of image.

16:50.342 --> 16:52.044
You could have at least
dressed in all white.

16:52.111 --> 16:53.912
I could have at least not
given a [bleep] because you

16:53.979 --> 16:54.913
know I don't.

16:54.980 --> 16:55.914
You could have
stayed your ass at home.

16:55.981 --> 16:56.715
I'm here.

16:56.782 --> 16:57.316
God bless.

16:57.383 --> 17:00.519
I could go.

17:00.586 --> 17:02.554
Do you get it now, Hazel?

17:02.621 --> 17:04.757
I'm here with another woman.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.925
I gave your song away, Hazel.

17:06.992 --> 17:11.163
All I want to do is pop bottles,
go crazy, hang out with my baby

17:11.230 --> 17:13.766
