WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:17.267
I've missed this little drive
to the old salt mine.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.393
Paris has its charms,

00:18.476 --> 00:19.477
but there's something
about Boston.

00:19.561 --> 00:20.854
Oh, ow!

00:20.937 --> 00:21.855
Sorry.

00:21.938 --> 00:24.983
We were gone so long,
Paulski.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.402
The mountain of mail
I collected would agree.

00:27.485 --> 00:31.531
Oh, yes, you'll never guess
what we found, Avis,

00:31.614 --> 00:35.577
buried between newsletters
from Paul's judo dojo.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.871
Go on, the suspense
is killing me.

00:37.954 --> 00:41.541
A letter from CBS.

00:41.624 --> 00:44.252
Are you going
to be on "Sullivan"?

00:44.336 --> 00:48.048
They want to talk to me
about doing a show for them.

00:48.131 --> 00:51.301
Oh, well,
what are you going to say?

00:51.384 --> 00:53.511
Oh, I'm not even going
to think about it now.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.680
We've been away for months.

00:57.849 --> 00:59.184
It's like
the first day of school.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.894
I know.
I couldn't sleep last night.

01:00.977 --> 01:02.479
I am so ready
for her leftovers.

01:02.562 --> 01:04.105
The most gourmet thing
I had this summer

01:04.188 --> 01:05.272
was an Entenmann's crumb cake.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.775
Oh, those are good cakes.

01:06.858 --> 01:11.112
Lucy, we're home!

01:11.196 --> 01:12.113
Wrong show.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.406
Welcome back, Julia.

01:13.490 --> 01:16.076
Oh, it's wonderful
to be back.

01:16.158 --> 01:18.578
I have missed each
and every one of you.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.705
Welcome home, Julia.

01:26.169 --> 01:28.045
Oh, I am full up
with inspiration.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.422
I can't wait
to hear about it.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.299
- Hello, Alice.
- Oh!

01:33.343 --> 01:34.761
And Julia, we're going
to put these here.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.346
Oh, yes, lay it careful.

01:36.429 --> 01:40.850
Now, everyone, before we start,
I have brought goodies.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.185
Come and find your name.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.687
- I hope you like them.
- Aww!

01:43.770 --> 01:47.565
And gentlemen, the toys
are for your children.

01:47.649 --> 01:50.485
Oh, Benny,
let me take a look at you.

01:50.568 --> 01:51.695
Have you lost weight?

01:51.777 --> 01:53.113
Just the weight
I put on last season.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.824
Oh, not for long, then.

01:55.907 --> 02:01.329
All hail Julia,
our conquering heroine!

02:01.413 --> 02:04.749
Oh, Hunter,
how nice to see you.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.043
Ditto.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.461
A moment for
a quick catch-up?

02:08.544 --> 02:09.795
Of course, yes.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.674
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:12.757 --> 02:16.094
Oh, how do you
like the poster?

02:16.177 --> 02:18.304
Oh, I do.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.682
Although, shouldn't it
be outside the building?

02:20.765 --> 02:22.100
- Oh, they are.
- Oh.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.602
It's going to be
a stellar second season.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.730
Yes, it certainly is.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.191
We sold in 12 more markets
while you were gone.

02:30.275 --> 02:33.445
We'll be airing in every region
of the country simultaneously.

02:33.528 --> 02:37.281
Sunday nights are Julia nights
from coast to coast.

02:37.365 --> 02:41.244
How thrilling--
a whole new audience.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.997
I have big plans
for this season, Hunter--

02:44.079 --> 02:45.874
recipes I haven't
even covered in my book,

02:45.957 --> 02:47.208
they're so new.

02:47.292 --> 02:52.339
OK, but desserts are your
new sweet spot, pun intended.

02:53.048 --> 02:55.091
Chicago, Philly, Houston,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.260
they all want
more dessert episodes.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.263
Oh, I see. OK.

03:00.347 --> 03:03.641
So, um, what's on your mind?

03:03.725 --> 03:06.019
While in France,
it occurred to me that

03:06.102 --> 03:08.688
Paul might direct
a few episodes this season.

03:08.772 --> 03:11.399
He has that keen
photographer's eye.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.360
And, well,
he's my best collaborator.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.821
No need.
I appreciate the gesture.

03:16.905 --> 03:19.824
- But you're not a mom and pop--
- Gesture?

03:19.908 --> 03:21.493
Paul is not a gesture.

03:21.576 --> 03:22.577
The show is big.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.621
You're big.

03:24.704 --> 03:28.375
I got you a big director.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.668
Oh.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.670
Albert's on
the verge of tears.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.546
And I'll tell you something.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.674
I don't like seeing
that man cry.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.091
Men shouldn't cry.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.469
The writing is on
the wall, Ralphie.

03:39.552 --> 03:42.055
Next thing you know, we all
go the way of the jazz priest.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.848
And I don't mean heaven.

03:43.932 --> 03:46.101
What do we do?

03:46.184 --> 03:48.520
What did the UAW do?

03:48.603 --> 03:50.689
What did the coal miners do?

03:50.772 --> 03:52.190
Die of black lung?

03:52.273 --> 03:54.025
Oh, I can't wait
for you to see it.

03:54.109 --> 03:56.528
I'm proud of you, Russ,
the second I have an hour.

03:56.611 --> 03:58.196
Oh, oh, no, no, no,
I don't want you to watch it

03:58.279 --> 03:59.906
in installments.

03:59.989 --> 04:00.990
Installments?

04:01.074 --> 04:04.244
The runtime is just
under three hours, pal.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.455
But it feels like a lot less.

04:07.539 --> 04:08.957
Oh, wow.

04:09.040 --> 04:11.584
That--maybe I should wait

04:11.668 --> 04:13.712
until it's closer
to fighting weight.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.297
I only have fresh eyes once,
right?

04:16.380 --> 04:19.509
Oh, and Russ,
can we go back to Al?

04:19.591 --> 04:21.302
Al is worse.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.891
Let's get an excerpt from
the draft in "The Atlantic,"

04:26.975 --> 04:28.810
first-hand adventures

04:28.893 --> 04:32.981
with an ancient Indian tribe
in the rainforest.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.692
Apologies for the delay.

04:35.775 --> 04:37.861
We started without you.

04:37.944 --> 04:41.948
The posthumous Plath collection
is out to other houses.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.074
It is amazing.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.743
After all Judith's hard work,

04:44.826 --> 04:47.120
it's no match
for someone's incompetence.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.539
Go to hell.

04:49.622 --> 04:51.374
Already there.

04:51.457 --> 04:52.751
Pevius, take this over.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.753
See if we can
salvage something.

04:54.836 --> 04:57.839
Alfred, the estate
has been so difficult.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.759
Really, it's hard to
imagine another outcome.

05:00.842 --> 05:02.969
Nobody's asking
for your opinion.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.388
If you would have
listened to me

05:05.472 --> 05:07.807
and hadn't rejected Plath
in the first place--

05:07.891 --> 05:09.059
Then what?

05:09.142 --> 05:10.685
Enough with the excuses.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.604
We're all getting
tired of them.

05:18.902 --> 05:21.029
I need it by morning.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.913
Plath wasn't your fault.

05:33.082 --> 05:36.544
Ted Hughes
is a controlling bastard.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.380
Stop, stop, stop.

05:38.463 --> 05:40.632
Nobody gives a shit.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.968
That chapbook wouldn't
cover a pair of shoes.

05:44.052 --> 05:47.305
I'm just frustrated--

05:47.389 --> 05:49.808
frustrated with you.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.810
Me?

05:51.893 --> 05:55.522
You abandoned me
with the James Cain draft,

05:55.605 --> 05:57.565
taller than my borzoi.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.109
No notes, no context.

05:59.192 --> 06:01.236
James Cain's on autopilot.

06:01.319 --> 06:02.821
For a cookbook.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.615
I worked on three different
manuscripts that trip.

06:05.699 --> 06:07.075
You worked on eating bonbons.

06:07.158 --> 06:09.327
Hey, you have a right
to be angry, Blanche,

06:09.411 --> 06:11.871
but not with me.

06:11.955 --> 06:15.250
I am not your punching bag.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.337
If you feel like
a punching bag,

06:19.421 --> 06:21.881
you've never been punched,
my dear.

06:21.965 --> 06:24.050
No, this is just
the nature of the work--

06:24.134 --> 06:25.927
the work.

06:26.011 --> 06:29.180
You think you can come
and go as you please.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.475
This is not just
some job, Judith.

06:32.558 --> 06:33.727
Just because you
have laurels

06:33.810 --> 06:36.104
doesn't mean
you can rest on them.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.816
The moment you do
is the moment you are out.

06:39.899 --> 06:41.985
The truth is,

06:42.068 --> 06:45.947
you can be fired.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.533
Or I could quit.

06:52.537 --> 06:53.663
- Julia?
- Yes.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.081
I want you to meet
your new director.

06:55.165 --> 06:57.167
Oh, yes.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.127
Julia Child, Elaine Levitch.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.920
It is a pleasure
to meet you, Julia.

07:01.004 --> 07:04.799
Oh, thank you for fitting
in Russ' enormous shoes.

07:04.883 --> 07:07.510
Well, you know what they say
about men with big shoes.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.180
- Big feet.
- Oh, yes, right.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.849
And you're from LA, too,
aren't you?

07:12.932 --> 07:14.142
Pasadena.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.229
Well, maybe after the shoot,
we could take some time,

07:18.313 --> 07:20.148
and you could give me
a sense of the show?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.319
It's the show.

07:24.402 --> 07:26.321
Let's get started.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.655
Yes.

07:27.739 --> 07:29.157
Hey, everybody,
before we dive in,

07:29.240 --> 07:31.993
I just want to say a few words.

07:32.077 --> 07:36.289
Um, I'm so glad to be here,

07:36.373 --> 07:39.084
to be working on this show
with this amazing woman.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.211
It's an honor, truly.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.421
And I'm thrilled to be
a part of this team

07:43.505 --> 07:45.173
because that's what we are.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.550
We each bring our own gifts
to the table.

07:47.634 --> 07:49.552
And together, we make a meal.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.346
And in this case, literally.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.642
OK, let's make a show.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.354
Butterflies?

07:59.437 --> 08:00.730
Caterpillars.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.857
Julia, we're ready for you.

08:05.860 --> 08:07.904
This season will
take us on a journey

08:07.987 --> 08:10.865
through France
with delicious stews,

08:10.949 --> 08:12.534
delectable desserts,

08:12.617 --> 08:16.246
and even a bit
of nouvelle cuisine.

08:16.329 --> 08:17.497
Cut.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.249
Cut why?
What's wrong?

08:19.332 --> 08:20.625
It's your eyeline.
It's just slightly off.

08:20.709 --> 08:21.626
Does it matter?

08:21.710 --> 08:23.461
We've never had eyeline
problems before.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.629
Hey, Benny?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.715
Could you just boom up a bit?

08:26.798 --> 08:30.051
No tilt,
just a couple inches higher.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.847
Nice.

08:33.929 --> 08:35.347
Much better.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.850
All right,
let's take it from the top.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.518
Rolling.

08:38.601 --> 08:40.186
And action.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.149
Hello, Kansas City!

08:44.232 --> 08:46.401
This is Julia Child.

08:48.778 --> 08:50.572
Knock, knock.

08:50.655 --> 08:52.240
Julia.

08:52.323 --> 08:55.702
Hey, welcome back.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.704
Oh, gosh.

08:57.787 --> 09:00.582
That's what I call a hug.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.000
How was France?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.502
Oh, it's magnifique.

09:04.586 --> 09:06.296
No, I'm glad to be back
in the swing of things.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.049
My mind is racing with ideas.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.717
I'm sorry
I didn't come by set.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.719
I wanted to give Elaine
some space.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.554
How'd it go?

09:14.637 --> 09:17.474
Well, it's fine.
There's no shorthand.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.225
Yeah, that'll just
take some time.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.353
It took us a little while.

09:21.436 --> 09:24.356
Yes, of course.

09:24.439 --> 09:26.608
Well, I brought you
something from Paris.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.902
Oh, come on.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.028
What...

09:32.238 --> 09:34.741
Foie gras.

09:34.824 --> 09:35.950
Wow, remember that?

09:36.034 --> 09:38.036
Well, yes, of course.
My life depended on it.

09:39.329 --> 09:43.540
A delicious souvenir of more
than just France, thank you.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.920
And how are you?

09:47.003 --> 09:48.546
What's the latest?

09:48.630 --> 09:50.423
I'm good, busy.

09:50.507 --> 09:53.968
I'm working hard on this new
documentary news program.

09:54.052 --> 09:56.096
I interviewed
a Harvard professor.

09:56.179 --> 09:58.973
And I didn't make
a complete fool out of myself,

10:00.350 --> 10:01.601
I don't think.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.812
It's been very
rewarding so far.

10:03.895 --> 10:07.899
I'm trying to shake things up,
you know?

10:07.982 --> 10:11.277
- Well, that's wonderful, Russ.
- Yeah.

10:22.539 --> 10:25.834
I'm here to see
about my grade.

10:25.917 --> 10:28.253
I'm busy.

10:28.336 --> 10:32.007
So I'm looking at an F
for fleeing?

10:34.426 --> 10:36.928
Stanley, you have to know that
I haven't been out on a date

10:37.012 --> 10:39.180
with a man in over 45 years.

10:39.264 --> 10:43.476
The last time I was on a date,
the Model T was all the rage.

10:43.560 --> 10:47.897
There were no televisions,
no commercial air travel.

10:47.981 --> 10:51.234
I'm talking pre-Oreo.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.361
I have no excuse
for what I did.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.238
It was cruel.

10:55.321 --> 10:58.324
And it was cowardly.

10:58.408 --> 11:03.747
The honest to God truth is,
I got scared.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.792
I'm really sorry.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.721
Pre-Oreo, huh?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.723
Post-sandwich.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.808
Well, there's a connection.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.269
Evolution, if you will.

11:29.898 --> 11:31.733
Just tell me next time.

11:31.816 --> 11:36.112
I know.
I'm a child.

11:36.196 --> 11:39.449
But I don't pick the parsley
off my chicken.

11:50.251 --> 11:53.004
My colleague Elaine Levitch
referred me.

11:53.088 --> 11:56.257
No major health issues and
no prior pregnancies, correct?

11:56.341 --> 11:58.218
- No, sir.
- Are you married?

11:58.301 --> 12:01.554
No, sir, I'm not.

12:01.638 --> 12:06.142
May I ask why you're seeking
contraception pills?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.395
I just want
to be responsible.

12:08.478 --> 12:12.899
There are lots of ways
to be responsible.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.402
Are you currently
in a relationship?

12:15.485 --> 12:19.155
- Yes.
- A fiancé?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.199
Uh, no, no, he's just--

12:21.282 --> 12:23.702
Do you have multiple
sexual partners?

12:23.785 --> 12:27.872
Me?
No, no.

12:27.956 --> 12:33.253
Miss Naman, I've seen
patients like you before.

12:33.336 --> 12:37.507
I need you to answer truthfully
or I can't help you.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.680
One partner.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.016
It's not my protocol
to prescribe this drug

12:46.099 --> 12:49.686
to a patient
in your situation.

12:51.229 --> 12:52.564
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.607
You're an unmarried woman
who wants to have sex

12:54.691 --> 12:56.109
without consequences.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.403
I'm doing you a favor,
young lady.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.988
It's for your own good.

13:17.881 --> 13:20.550
Sorry.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.594
How can I help?

13:22.677 --> 13:24.929
Well, hello to you too, Avis.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.599
- Where did you come from?
- None of your beeswax.

13:27.682 --> 13:29.809
Here.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.478
Great having the gang
back together, huh?

13:31.561 --> 13:32.979
I'll say.

13:33.063 --> 13:35.523
And that Elaine...

13:35.607 --> 13:38.443
The way she jumped in
and just--

13:38.526 --> 13:40.445
it was like
she'd always been there.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.863
Didn't miss a beat.

13:41.946 --> 13:44.741
It's strange, I've never been
directed by a woman before.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.950
Isn't it fabulous?

13:46.034 --> 13:48.453
Oh, and when she had
Benny lift the camera,

13:48.536 --> 13:50.747
it was as though she--

13:50.830 --> 13:52.790
she brought Julia to scale.

13:52.874 --> 13:55.543
I wanted you to direct, Paul.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.671
- Hunter rejected the thought.
- He was right.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.673
I'd have been out of my depth.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.884
Today was a master class,
really.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.303
Um, not to change
the subject--

14:05.387 --> 14:10.266
Stanley wants to join us
for dinner tonight.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.896
Stanley?

14:14.979 --> 14:16.981
The man you were
running away from,

14:17.065 --> 14:19.526
who you refused to tell me
you were running away from?

14:19.609 --> 14:21.069
Apparently she ran a lap.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.529
Oh!

14:22.612 --> 14:24.781
- I was wrong.
- Oh.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.786
Anyone who can get you
to say that out loud

14:29.869 --> 14:31.579
is my new best friend.

14:31.663 --> 14:34.749
Table for four. Oh!

14:34.833 --> 14:36.584
One day,
we'll find ourselves

14:36.668 --> 14:39.587
in a war we didn't ask for.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.428
Okay.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.887
It's so good, Russ.

14:49.889 --> 14:54.477
Like, moving, in the way
that "Dumbo" is moving.

14:54.561 --> 14:59.607
That scene where his little
trunk is linked with his--

14:59.691 --> 15:03.611
his mama's bigger trunk
through the prison bars?

15:03.695 --> 15:06.448
Oh, thank you.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.741
The hours flew by.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.951
I want people
to remember

15:10.035 --> 15:12.495
where they were
when they saw this.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.665
Their living rooms.

15:15.749 --> 15:18.251
Do you think it's ready
to show Madeline Anderson?

15:18.335 --> 15:19.878
Who's Madeline Anderson?

15:19.961 --> 15:21.504
She's an amazing
documentarian.

15:21.588 --> 15:24.549
And she's in town for work
and wants to meet Julia.

15:24.632 --> 15:28.261
I'm hoping to show it to her
while she's here tomorrow.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.847
Get ready, Madeline Anderson.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.516
Russ Morash is about
to blow your mind.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.444
You OK?

15:44.527 --> 15:46.404
It shouldn't even bother me
at this point.

15:46.488 --> 15:48.948
But I've had it.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.992
- What did she do this time?
- The two of them.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.702
It's "Who's Afraid
of Virginia Woolf,"

15:52.786 --> 15:54.079
get the guest.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.081
And I'm the guest.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.921
I don't want to be at work,
always wishing I were home.

16:05.131 --> 16:06.383
At least you have
a place to go.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.551
What does Blanche have?

16:12.222 --> 16:16.768
If I wasn't so angry at her,
my heart would be breaking.

16:16.851 --> 16:18.895
Stanley,
Avis told us you worked

16:18.978 --> 16:20.480
on The Manhattan Project?

16:20.563 --> 16:22.399
My claim to shame.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.984
No, no, I'm so curious.

16:25.068 --> 16:27.570
Were you and Oppenheimer
shoulder to shoulder?

16:27.654 --> 16:29.656
I don't stand
that close to people.

16:29.739 --> 16:33.118
As a physicist, it was
intellectually thrilling.

16:33.201 --> 16:36.913
But one of the dangers
of working with the very small

16:36.996 --> 16:40.500
is losing sight
of the very big.

16:40.583 --> 16:42.252
Changed the world.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.587
Ave is a bit biased.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.047
Ave.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.341
Hey, did I ever tell you
my Einstein story?

16:48.425 --> 16:50.051
You met Einstein?

16:50.135 --> 16:51.469
He's full of surprises.

16:51.553 --> 16:52.846
Please tell us.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.098
So I was doing
a fellowship at Princeton.

16:55.181 --> 16:59.060
And I wandered into this ice
cream shop on Nassau Street.

16:59.144 --> 17:01.938
And who do I see in line
but Einstein.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.231
You're kidding.

17:03.314 --> 17:05.733
I said, pardon me,
Professor Einstein.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.277
What's good here?

17:07.359 --> 17:11.614
And he said, "Well, boychik,
I like the strawberry.

17:11.698 --> 17:14.534
But it's all relative."

17:22.416 --> 17:25.462
Hey, what's next weekend
look like for you?

17:25.545 --> 17:27.464
I got my trial coming up.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.467
But I just can't stop
thinking about,

17:30.550 --> 17:32.927
well, you know.

17:34.054 --> 17:36.139
Alice, hello?

17:36.222 --> 17:37.557
Yeah.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.309
You OK?

17:39.392 --> 17:41.227
I have to talk to be OK?

17:41.311 --> 17:46.649
No, no, but what
about next weekend?

17:46.733 --> 17:47.859
I want to see you.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.028
Yeah,
I want to see you too, but--

17:50.111 --> 17:51.363
But what?

17:51.446 --> 17:52.822
We can't do what
we did last time.

17:52.906 --> 17:55.075
What?
I love what we did last time.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.494
That's not what I mean.

17:57.577 --> 17:59.537
We weren't careful, Isaac.

18:02.540 --> 18:05.960
Then we'll be careful.

18:06.044 --> 18:09.130
Sometimes careful
isn't enough.

18:09.214 --> 18:12.592
OK, then,
we'll be very careful.

18:12.676 --> 18:15.929
Look, what happened--

18:16.012 --> 18:18.556
that won't happen again,
not like that.

18:18.640 --> 18:19.808
I promise you.

18:21.726 --> 18:25.522
And if anything did happen,

18:25.605 --> 18:28.149
we'd deal with it together.

18:28.233 --> 18:30.235
We'd get married.

18:30.318 --> 18:34.489
I'd get a job in Boston
at some stodgy law firm.

18:34.572 --> 18:38.827
I'd buy you a big house
and a brand new Maytag.

18:41.204 --> 18:43.289
Right,

18:43.373 --> 18:46.501
and I'd spend my life
using it.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.086
What did you really think?

18:48.169 --> 18:51.256
Well, he's a peach, Avis,
very funny.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.674
He talks a lot.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.759
Well, he's lived
a fascinating life.

18:54.843 --> 18:56.052
Really?

18:56.136 --> 18:58.680
Oh, really, he was charming.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.599
Yeah.

19:01.683 --> 19:04.102
Well, I'm glad.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.854
- Thank you.
- What for?

19:05.937 --> 19:07.647
He's adorable.

19:07.731 --> 19:08.815
OK, good night.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.401
Good night.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.611
- Well...
- Well, what?

19:13.695 --> 19:15.363
Do we think he's good enough?

19:15.447 --> 19:17.365
He clearly makes her happy.

19:17.449 --> 19:19.325
Oh, so you
actually liked him.

19:19.409 --> 19:21.036
Oh, I loved him.

19:21.119 --> 19:23.872
But unfortunately, I'm taken.

19:29.085 --> 19:32.130
It's not much fun being
the curmudgeon between us.

19:32.213 --> 19:35.675
I rather like it.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.345
I'd like eight steaks,

19:38.428 --> 19:39.888
all the fat trimmed
from the sides.

19:39.971 --> 19:42.265
- Thank you very much.
- Yes, sir.

19:45.894 --> 19:47.687
Julia?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.358
Frank.

19:51.441 --> 19:52.942
It's been years.

19:53.026 --> 19:55.278
Goodness,
what are you doing here?

19:55.362 --> 19:58.698
My niece's birthday,
but I'm in D.C.

19:58.782 --> 20:00.950
I work with the FBI now.

20:01.034 --> 20:03.453
I prefer a thicker cut,
1.5 inches.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.957
Oh, congrats on
the cooking program.

20:08.041 --> 20:09.250
My wife loves it.

20:09.334 --> 20:10.919
Oh, why, thank you.

20:11.002 --> 20:15.256
They make that
at WGBH, correct?

20:15.340 --> 20:18.218
You know, my boss, Mr. Hoover,
possibly the greatest American

20:18.301 --> 20:21.262
since Abraham Lincoln, has
made it the Bureau's business

20:21.346 --> 20:22.972
to keep this country safe.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.475
Oh, and I feel safer
just knowing that.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.227
You know, it's quite lucky

20:27.310 --> 20:29.604
I ran into you, Julia,
because there are elements,

20:29.688 --> 20:31.940
subversive elements--

20:32.023 --> 20:33.858
less fat on the sides--

20:33.942 --> 20:36.903
who are trying to undermine
what makes this country great.

20:36.986 --> 20:40.156
And my job is to fight
leftist dissidents.

20:40.240 --> 20:44.244
And you might just be the one
to help me out at WGBH.

20:44.327 --> 20:46.454
Oh, Frank,
that's not even funny.

20:46.538 --> 20:48.623
I'm not laughing.
Am I laughing?

20:48.707 --> 20:50.875
That one needs to
be more marbled.

20:53.420 --> 20:56.214
So this isn't just
a chance meeting.

20:56.297 --> 20:59.092
I don't know, is it?

20:59.175 --> 21:03.471
I can assure you, WGBH is
not a dissident organization.

21:03.555 --> 21:05.140
You let us be
the judge of that.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.684
Well, I think I would know.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.561
They're my friends, Frank.

21:09.644 --> 21:11.980
I remember you
from the OSS, Julia.

21:12.063 --> 21:14.607
And you look more
circumspect than ever.

21:14.691 --> 21:16.985
They'd be none the wiser
if you just kept those

21:17.068 --> 21:19.863
trained eyes and ears open.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.456
Where'd he go?

21:31.291 --> 21:33.460
And tomorrow,
I'm interviewing Lee Webb,

21:33.543 --> 21:38.465
this BU kid who's the
National Secretary of Students

21:38.548 --> 21:39.966
for a Democratic Society.

21:40.050 --> 21:42.385
Well, apparently,
they have the best marijuana.

21:42.469 --> 21:45.138
Not that I would know.

21:49.726 --> 21:52.354
I just wanted to check in.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.731
Season two, here we go.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.027
I've missed you,
my veteran lead producer

21:59.110 --> 22:01.654
who came up with me
through the trenches.

22:04.824 --> 22:09.746
I have plans for us, big plans.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.873
It makes me so happy, Julia.

22:11.956 --> 22:15.710
I am just brimming with ideas.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.338
You know, I'm the one
that got you Elaine.

22:18.421 --> 22:20.757
- Isn't she incredible?
- Oh, she's--

22:20.840 --> 22:22.884
And now, Elaine and I
are working on something

22:22.967 --> 22:26.471
that feels kind of amazing.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.598
And I don't think
I would have had the courage

22:28.682 --> 22:31.184
if it weren't for your example.

22:31.267 --> 22:32.894
That's very generous of you.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.689
I want to start taking
more control over my life

22:35.772 --> 22:37.732
and not just making
accommodations

22:37.816 --> 22:39.859
for other people.

22:39.943 --> 22:41.778
Something else
we have in common.

22:43.988 --> 22:45.615
Shall we?

22:45.699 --> 22:47.367
May I ask you
a personal question?

22:47.450 --> 22:48.910
Yes, of course.

22:50.662 --> 22:52.956
How come you and Paul
didn't have children?

22:55.917 --> 22:57.460
Well, we wanted to.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.838
But I was deep into my 30s
when we met.

22:59.921 --> 23:02.966
And Paul's a decade my senior.

23:03.049 --> 23:04.634
We tried.

23:04.718 --> 23:06.970
I imagine it would
have been wonderful

23:07.053 --> 23:08.346
to raise children together.

23:08.430 --> 23:10.223
But then, of course,
if we had,

23:10.306 --> 23:12.350
I doubt I'd be here
with you now.

23:23.528 --> 23:24.529
What is this?

23:24.612 --> 23:27.032
A peace offering.

23:27.115 --> 23:28.742
I'm being nice to you, Blanche.

23:28.825 --> 23:31.578
Are you crazy?

23:31.661 --> 23:33.997
I don't eat from The Palm.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.129
No dressing.

23:43.548 --> 23:45.508
And shrimp are
only 10 calories.

23:45.592 --> 23:48.636
Of course I know that.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.432
Do you know
that a nectarine

23:52.515 --> 23:55.894
has twice as many calories
as a peach?

23:55.977 --> 23:58.855
You've mentioned it
a few times now.

24:02.442 --> 24:06.696
I'll have three shrimp.

24:06.780 --> 24:08.365
But that's it.

24:08.448 --> 24:10.617
You take the rest.

24:18.208 --> 24:21.711
Well, you're just going to
sit there and watch me eat?

24:21.795 --> 24:23.588
Oh.

24:23.672 --> 24:25.590
Walk me through this.

24:25.674 --> 24:29.177
I bet you won't be able
to read it either.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.765
Julia, we will take you
on your mark

24:33.848 --> 24:34.891
whenever you're ready.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.309
Yes, just where I was headed.

24:36.393 --> 24:40.522
In fact, I want to talk you
through my entrance...

24:40.605 --> 24:41.815
What's this?

24:41.898 --> 24:44.359
Oh, I wanted it
to be a surprise.

24:44.442 --> 24:46.611
Let's--tell me more
about your intro first.

24:46.695 --> 24:49.364
Yes, well, I plan to open
with an introduction

24:49.447 --> 24:52.701
of the dish and its cultural
context in the modern

24:52.784 --> 24:56.871
nouvelle cuisine,
simplicity and creativity

24:56.955 --> 25:01.876
at once finding its way into
this gorgeous loup en croûte.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.712
That sounds lovely.

25:03.795 --> 25:06.548
Yes, and what's
going on over there?

25:06.631 --> 25:10.427
Well, it involves Paul.

25:10.510 --> 25:11.678
- Paul?
- Paul?

25:11.761 --> 25:14.014
Well, everyone told me how
special your relationship is.

25:14.097 --> 25:15.974
And I thought, why not
highlight that on the show?

25:16.057 --> 25:18.560
So picture it.
It's the top of the episode.

25:18.643 --> 25:19.894
And Paul is at the office.

25:19.978 --> 25:22.522
And he's calling home to say
he's bringing friends over.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.692
And you realize,
I'm not just making dinner.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.694
It's a whole party.

25:27.777 --> 25:31.156
It's time to bring out
the big fish.

25:32.907 --> 25:35.744
Paul doesn't work
at an office.

25:35.827 --> 25:37.203
He can be calling
from anywhere.

25:37.287 --> 25:39.831
It's not far off
from reality, actually.

25:39.914 --> 25:43.626
Julia and I host
incredible dinner parties.

25:43.710 --> 25:45.378
Well, it's certainly
something new.

25:45.462 --> 25:46.379
Well, yes.

25:47.922 --> 25:50.675
Let's give it a try.

25:50.759 --> 25:51.885
And, action.

25:51.968 --> 25:53.553
OK.

25:53.636 --> 25:54.554
Hello, Julia.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.473
Um, you forgot to dial, Paul.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.894
It's just rehearsal.
We can do it again.

26:14.157 --> 26:16.451
I'm waiting for her
to answer.

26:16.534 --> 26:17.952
Hello, Julia.

26:18.036 --> 26:19.662
It's Paul.

26:19.746 --> 26:22.499
I've invited some
friends to dinner.

26:22.582 --> 26:24.459
What's cooking?

26:24.542 --> 26:25.877
That didn't feel honest.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.214
I've invited some
friends for dinner.

26:29.297 --> 26:31.091
- Psst.
- Hm?

26:31.174 --> 26:33.259
Stanley wants
to come over tonight.

26:33.343 --> 26:35.845
- For dinner?
- For dessert.

26:35.929 --> 26:37.138
Oh, I see.

26:37.222 --> 26:38.890
That's moving a little fast.

26:38.973 --> 26:41.059
- You think so?
- What do you think, Julia?

26:41.142 --> 26:42.435
It's a work in progress.

26:42.519 --> 26:44.145
Oh, it's brilliant, Paulski.

26:44.229 --> 26:46.648
Julia, we can actually
rehearse your intro now.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.108
Oh.

26:52.237 --> 26:55.156
Ready, and action.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.866
Well, you heard him.

26:56.950 --> 27:00.453
We're expecting
a full table tonight.

27:00.537 --> 27:01.663
I'm Julia Child.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.289
And today on
"The French Chef,"

27:03.373 --> 27:05.417
we'll be making
loup en croûte,

27:05.500 --> 27:09.170
a delicious sea bass
and puff pastry showstopper

27:09.254 --> 27:11.006
that's sure to please a crowd.

27:12.674 --> 27:15.218
That must be
our guest of honor.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.637
What is it now?

27:17.721 --> 27:19.347
Roland, we are rehearsing.

27:19.431 --> 27:20.932
This is a work action.

27:21.016 --> 27:23.393
We're walking out.

27:23.476 --> 27:25.353
Thank you so much for
making this possible, Russ.

27:25.437 --> 27:26.604
Of course.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.982
If you have a few minutes
after, or 100,

27:29.065 --> 27:31.443
I'd love to show you something.

27:35.655 --> 27:37.157
- Right here, right here.
- Thank you.

27:37.240 --> 27:39.075
You can't unionize
your management.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.828
- Who made that rule up?
- It's literally the only rule.

27:41.911 --> 27:44.664
Elaine could walk out.
Julia could walk out.

27:44.748 --> 27:47.208
- I don't even get paid.
- Then you should walk out.

27:47.292 --> 27:49.669
I'm sorry,
what is going on here?

27:49.753 --> 27:52.547
Millie's gone.
Father O'Connor is gone.

27:52.630 --> 27:54.632
Even poor Albert's
on the chopping block.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.301
And for what?

27:56.384 --> 27:58.511
For not being Julia Child.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.389
We're hardworking people
doing our best.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.141
And that used to be just fine.

28:03.224 --> 28:05.935
But now, our best
isn't good enough?

28:06.019 --> 28:09.481
All the regular folks
in the world get the boot?

28:09.564 --> 28:13.068
As a proud member
of the mediocre majority,

28:13.151 --> 28:14.486
I say, enough.

28:14.569 --> 28:15.695
Robert.

28:15.779 --> 28:18.406
Hunter, for the last time,
my name is Roland.

28:18.490 --> 28:19.783
Great.

28:19.866 --> 28:21.493
Now, shut up, Roland.

28:21.576 --> 28:23.745
If you don't mind.

28:23.828 --> 28:25.830
He got it.

28:25.914 --> 28:27.624
Yeah, right, all right.

28:29.459 --> 28:31.211
I wish I brought my camera.

28:31.294 --> 28:33.171
All right, let's reset.

28:33.254 --> 28:36.841
Right. Now, then, Lou?

28:36.925 --> 28:38.843
Where were we, hm?

28:40.804 --> 28:42.138
What on Earth
has been happening here

28:42.222 --> 28:43.598
while I was gone?

28:43.682 --> 28:46.476
Honestly, very little
for four months--

28:46.559 --> 28:48.561
kind of a problem.

28:48.645 --> 28:49.771
I don't understand.

28:49.854 --> 28:51.940
"The French Chef"
only got bigger,

28:52.023 --> 28:53.775
which is great,
aside from the fact

28:53.858 --> 28:55.235
that it made
everything else smaller.

28:55.318 --> 28:56.861
Now they want it all big.

28:56.945 --> 28:59.614
- Who is they?
- Hal, the board.

28:59.698 --> 29:03.451
I've had to make some
tough decisions, Julia.

29:03.535 --> 29:04.911
Well, this isn't what
I was expecting

29:04.994 --> 29:06.204
to return to, Hunter.

29:06.287 --> 29:09.624
France was complicated enough.
I thought home would be home.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.917
Sure, sure.

29:11.001 --> 29:13.878
This show only works when
everyone is on the same team.

29:13.962 --> 29:15.213
I get it.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.298
But there's not much
to be done.

29:17.382 --> 29:19.092
The success train
has left the station

29:19.175 --> 29:21.344
and is halfway to Timbuktu.

29:21.428 --> 29:24.389
Julia, you have single-handedly

29:24.472 --> 29:27.684
turned this non-profit
into a business.

29:33.064 --> 29:35.150
All right.

29:35.233 --> 29:39.946
Now, before you say anything...

29:40.030 --> 29:43.491
your advice back in New York
has been my compass.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.452
I did just what you said.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.370
I looked in my backyard.

29:47.454 --> 29:49.205
It's all there.

29:49.289 --> 29:52.417
I can't thank you enough
for inspiring me.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.252
I'm so glad.

29:54.336 --> 29:57.213
So, thoughts?

29:58.840 --> 30:01.301
Your enthusiasm is inspiring.

30:03.803 --> 30:05.221
Also, very snazzy jacket.

30:05.305 --> 30:06.639
Right.

30:11.102 --> 30:13.521
Please don't take this
the wrong way.

30:13.605 --> 30:16.441
But this isn't
a documentary, Russ.

30:16.524 --> 30:20.570
It's a personal statement,
an opinion essay,

30:20.653 --> 30:24.282
a business card for you.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.825
But how do you--

30:25.909 --> 30:28.661
You made yourself
the central focus of the film.

30:28.745 --> 30:30.705
No documentary is free of bias,

30:30.789 --> 30:32.957
but our aim is to be invisible,

30:33.041 --> 30:35.377
to let the subject speak
for itself

30:35.460 --> 30:37.003
and allow the viewer
to come away

30:37.087 --> 30:40.632
with their own conclusions.

30:40.715 --> 30:43.927
You want people to come away
with something in particular.

30:44.010 --> 30:46.554
You don't have
a documentarian soul.

30:46.638 --> 30:48.431
You have a teacher soul.

30:53.061 --> 30:54.396
Russ, do you have a moment?

30:54.479 --> 30:56.314
This place has gone bananas.

30:56.398 --> 30:58.525
Julia.
May I call you Julia?

30:58.608 --> 31:01.152
I feel like I know you.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.488
Julia, Madeline Anderson,

31:03.571 --> 31:05.532
the documentarian
I met in New York.

31:05.615 --> 31:07.158
How lovely to meet you.

31:07.242 --> 31:10.745
I brought my copy
of "Mastering."

31:10.829 --> 31:13.498
- Would you sign it for me?
- Oh, yes, I'd love to.

31:18.712 --> 31:22.465
Your show, well,
it makes me happy.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.137
I cook with you
every Sunday night.

31:27.220 --> 31:30.598
And after a long
and often challenging week,

31:30.682 --> 31:32.767
that is something.

31:35.520 --> 31:38.398
Russ, gather everyone
you can find

31:38.481 --> 31:41.943
on "The French Chef" set
in 10 minutes.

31:42.027 --> 31:44.070
We are a family.

31:44.154 --> 31:46.614
I'm afraid we haven't
been acting like one.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.908
And it's maddening to think
that my little show

31:48.992 --> 31:51.077
is the cause.

31:51.161 --> 31:54.789
Egads, I don't want
animosity because of me.

31:54.873 --> 31:57.208
We need to support each other.

31:57.292 --> 32:01.046
And so we're going to do
what families do together--

32:01.129 --> 32:02.630
in Europe, at least.

32:02.714 --> 32:04.007
We're going to cook.

32:04.090 --> 32:06.301
- Ugh.
- Oh, yes, you too, Roland.

32:06.384 --> 32:07.969
And don't tell me
that you're mediocre

32:08.053 --> 32:10.138
and don't even want to try.

32:10.221 --> 32:12.807
Take a look at my
college transcript.

32:12.891 --> 32:17.479
The only way to succeed
is to attempt.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.992
Save some for tomorrow, huh?

32:31.076 --> 32:32.160
Oh.

32:36.164 --> 32:38.291
You know,

32:38.375 --> 32:40.335
you should join us
for dinner.

32:40.418 --> 32:41.878
Tonight?

32:41.961 --> 32:44.964
It's an open invitation.
You don't even have to eat.

32:45.048 --> 32:47.050
Don't tempt me.

32:47.133 --> 32:48.927
Visit.

32:49.010 --> 32:52.764
Play cards, drink martinis.

32:52.847 --> 32:54.724
Do you know mahjong?

32:54.808 --> 32:57.018
We know canasta.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.023
I couldn't.

33:02.107 --> 33:03.942
Of course, you could.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.736
We'd even let you win.

33:06.820 --> 33:09.948
Alfred's expecting me.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.408
It's just one night.

33:11.491 --> 33:14.494
We have a routine,

33:14.577 --> 33:17.914
50 years strong.

33:17.997 --> 33:21.543
At this point in my life,
it's too late to break it.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.384
But thank you.

33:33.513 --> 33:35.056
Of course.

33:38.226 --> 33:40.103
Oh, it's pretty good.

33:47.485 --> 33:50.488
How are you getting along,
Hunter?

33:50.572 --> 33:52.115
Take over for me, will you?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.159
- Hard work.
- It is hard.

34:01.041 --> 34:03.084
Very good.

34:15.472 --> 34:17.974
I've got to run
in about half an hour.

34:18.058 --> 34:21.061
I've got that dinner
with Stanley.

34:21.143 --> 34:23.605
Uh-huh.

34:23.688 --> 34:27.900
And then he's coming over.

34:27.984 --> 34:31.571
Avis, you have
a beautiful home.

34:31.654 --> 34:33.239
He looks half his age.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.784
You should let him in.

34:35.867 --> 34:38.536
Open those doors.

34:38.620 --> 34:40.789
Open them wide.

34:40.871 --> 34:43.208
Is this a metaphor?

34:43.291 --> 34:45.085
Yes.

34:47.253 --> 34:49.380
Oh, ha, ha, ha.

34:55.804 --> 34:58.139
You got to hand it to Julia.

34:58.223 --> 35:01.059
Oh, yeah, yeah, that was fun.

35:01.142 --> 35:04.145
Although you and Ralph
over-sugared the berries.

35:04.229 --> 35:07.065
I told Tilly not to
expect me before bed.

35:07.148 --> 35:09.067
Let's hit the lights
and get it rolling.

35:13.363 --> 35:14.823
It's bad, Hunter.

35:14.906 --> 35:17.117
Oh, you're just being modest.

35:17.200 --> 35:19.619
Uh, modesty would be saying

35:19.703 --> 35:22.330
I couldn't have done it
without everyone's help.

35:22.414 --> 35:24.541
This is actually bad.

35:26.418 --> 35:30.213
Well, how bad?

35:30.296 --> 35:32.716
Bad, bad.

35:32.799 --> 35:35.385
There's a scale
to these things.

35:35.468 --> 35:37.887
I'm sorry, Hunter.

35:37.971 --> 35:40.557
I know you were counting on me.

35:40.640 --> 35:45.020
I don't know how I let it
get this far before I realized.

36:02.412 --> 36:03.413
May I?

36:06.750 --> 36:07.834
Goodness.

36:10.128 --> 36:12.756
How was your niece's birthday?

36:12.839 --> 36:16.301
I don't have a niece.

36:16.384 --> 36:18.762
What do you have for me?

36:18.845 --> 36:21.306
Nothing, I swear,
or I'd tell you.

36:21.389 --> 36:22.891
Oh, boy.

36:22.974 --> 36:25.685
OK.

36:25.769 --> 36:28.021
Russ Morash,
he's been in contact

36:28.104 --> 36:30.106
with the Students
for a Democratic Society.

36:30.190 --> 36:32.108
They have been
undermining our efforts

36:32.192 --> 36:35.820
to stop the spread
of communism in Asia.

36:35.904 --> 36:37.822
Alice Naman,

36:37.906 --> 36:40.450
she's a member of the Congress
for Racial Equality.

36:40.533 --> 36:43.370
Do you know what SNCC is?

36:43.453 --> 36:45.497
Well, Alice's boyfriend does.

36:45.580 --> 36:47.040
He's quite familiar.

36:47.123 --> 36:49.793
Hunter Fox supported
Henry Wallace.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.920
This isn't funny, Frank.

36:52.003 --> 36:55.131
I'm not laughing.

36:55.215 --> 36:58.385
And I haven't even
gotten to Paul.

37:02.555 --> 37:05.725
Paul?

37:05.809 --> 37:07.519
What does that mean?

37:07.602 --> 37:11.356
You know what it means.

37:11.439 --> 37:13.858
And we wouldn't want any
of that to become public now,

37:13.942 --> 37:15.568
would we?

37:27.288 --> 37:30.500
Uncle Sam is counting on you.

37:39.175 --> 37:43.054
I was the junior high
girls hula hooping champion.

37:43.138 --> 37:45.265
You were?

37:45.348 --> 37:46.850
Last week.

37:46.933 --> 37:49.060
My hips were popping
like a radiator.

37:49.144 --> 37:50.895
But what do you know?

37:50.979 --> 37:52.313
Grandma won.

37:52.397 --> 37:54.149
Way to go, Grandma.

37:54.232 --> 37:57.193
You don't get
to call me that.

37:57.277 --> 37:59.362
Another wonderful evening,
Ave.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.616
Stanley...

38:07.704 --> 38:09.622
Would you like to come in?

38:14.502 --> 38:17.881
I would like that very much.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.813
And Paul has his
own role in the intro.

38:33.897 --> 38:36.066
Oh, and I told Julia
about our pilot,

38:36.149 --> 38:38.318
the "by women, for women" idea
I told you about?

38:38.401 --> 38:40.445
Oh, yes, I like that idea.

38:40.528 --> 38:42.989
Well, I told her how she
inspired me to take the leap.

38:43.073 --> 38:45.283
And she appreciated it,
I think.

38:45.367 --> 38:47.660
Oh, she saved the day
with that chocolate mousse.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.871
It was like summer camp,
a good one.

38:49.954 --> 38:52.624
What a busy and
interesting life you lead.

38:52.707 --> 38:54.417
Do you want some mousse?

38:54.501 --> 38:57.504
Of course I do.

38:57.587 --> 39:00.507
I'll clean up here, baby.

39:00.590 --> 39:04.135
Mm, you're in
an expensive mood tonight.

39:04.219 --> 39:05.762
I love it.

39:12.644 --> 39:14.312
Also, I slept with Isaac.

39:18.483 --> 39:21.569
And I want to keep
sleeping with Isaac.

39:21.653 --> 39:23.613
I tried to get protection.

39:23.697 --> 39:25.949
A woman at work, she referred me
to a doctor in Back Bay,

39:26.032 --> 39:29.077
but he was some old white man
who interrogated me.

39:29.160 --> 39:31.621
And he treated me like
I was a streetwalker.

39:31.705 --> 39:34.040
He wouldn't give me anything.

39:34.124 --> 39:36.501
And I didn't know how to
talk to you about it, Mama,

39:36.584 --> 39:38.878
because you've always told me
to wait until marriage.

39:38.962 --> 39:40.797
But now, I feel like
I don't know who to tell.

39:40.880 --> 39:44.217
Wait, you slept with Isaac?

39:47.804 --> 39:49.389
You're right
that I said to wait

39:49.472 --> 39:54.269
because in the eyes of the Lord,
you're one flesh now.

39:54.352 --> 39:56.855
You slept with Isaac.

39:56.938 --> 39:59.774
I worried you might
become an old maid.

39:59.858 --> 40:02.485
Mom.

40:02.569 --> 40:05.280
How was it?
Did you have fun?

40:05.363 --> 40:08.408
Don't--don't tell me.
Don't--don't tell me.

40:08.491 --> 40:10.243
Blink if you had fun.

40:12.912 --> 40:13.997
Ah!

40:14.080 --> 40:17.959
I knew it.
Oh, Alice.

40:18.043 --> 40:21.796
Oh, my baby is a grown woman.

40:21.880 --> 40:25.300
Mom, please.

40:25.383 --> 40:28.762
If this is what you want,
and I respect that,

40:28.845 --> 40:30.847
woman to woman,

40:30.930 --> 40:32.390
I'll get a prescription
from Dr. McCray.

40:32.474 --> 40:35.393
I'll say it's for
your sister-in-law.

40:35.477 --> 40:38.855
And I won't breathe
a word to your daddy.

40:41.024 --> 40:42.567
OK.

40:42.650 --> 40:44.611
Don't worry, baby.

40:44.694 --> 40:46.863
I got you, hmm?

40:46.946 --> 40:48.865
Come on. Mm.

40:48.948 --> 40:52.077
Oh. Thank you.

40:59.334 --> 41:01.252
I love this part.

41:05.006 --> 41:08.468
What a crazy day.

41:08.551 --> 41:11.513
You mean Roland?

41:11.596 --> 41:13.682
You're a wonderful woman

41:13.765 --> 41:17.185
succeeding in
a mediocre man's world.

41:17.268 --> 41:20.730
It comes with the territory.

41:20.814 --> 41:23.483
You're in the stratosphere now.

41:23.566 --> 41:26.653
If a few people can't handle it,
nuts to them.

41:26.736 --> 41:28.488
Let them go.

41:28.571 --> 41:31.116
Yes, I suppose so.

41:31.199 --> 41:33.326
Elaine's not mediocre.

41:33.410 --> 41:36.830
I like her.
She's got moxie.

41:36.913 --> 41:39.207
Well, she certainly has that.

41:39.290 --> 41:41.292
Big ideas.

41:43.712 --> 41:47.424
Well, I liked
how it was before,

41:47.507 --> 41:50.468
our little show.

41:50.552 --> 41:52.929
We didn't have to
share it with anyone.

41:53.013 --> 41:54.806
It's a feather in your cap.

41:54.889 --> 41:56.975
That's all.

41:57.058 --> 41:58.977
You don't have to share me.

41:59.060 --> 42:02.063
I'm your own private show.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.277
Oh, Paul.

42:07.360 --> 42:09.237
What was it you wanted
to tell me earlier?

42:13.450 --> 42:14.993
I don't remember now.

42:15.076 --> 42:17.996
It seemed important.

42:18.079 --> 42:19.581
Maybe it was to tell you

42:19.664 --> 42:22.667
how fabulous you were
in your cameo.

42:22.751 --> 42:27.964
It was strange,
a little thrilling.

42:28.048 --> 42:32.344
It gave me a window
into your magical world.

42:32.427 --> 42:34.596
But...

42:34.679 --> 42:38.308
I'm no star.

42:38.391 --> 42:42.604
You're my shining star.

42:42.687 --> 42:45.940
Oh, I guess I won't be
quite so anonymous anymore.

42:51.029 --> 42:53.406
You're a good man, Paulski.
