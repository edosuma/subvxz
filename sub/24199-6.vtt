00:00.484 --> 00:02.953
<i>Previously on
The Americans...</i>

00:03.055 --> 00:05.488
There's no easy way
to say this, Henry, but...

00:05.591 --> 00:08.358
we've been having a--
a rough patch at work...

00:08.460 --> 00:10.227
I thought you said
things were looking up.

00:10.329 --> 00:13.129
I know,
but... they're not.

00:13.232 --> 00:15.165
One of our
negotiators has been

00:15.267 --> 00:18.368
secretly meeting with a CIA
officer in the Soviet Division.

00:18.470 --> 00:20.503
We've got to find out
what he's saying,

00:20.606 --> 00:21.871
but I'd need your help.

00:21.974 --> 00:24.374
You'd have to meet Kimmy
in Greece.

00:24.476 --> 00:25.542
Was that out of line?

00:25.644 --> 00:27.711
I-I liked it.

00:27.813 --> 00:30.013
Have we ever gotten
one good thing off that X-ray?

00:30.115 --> 00:32.148
Aw, come on. You're like
a goddamn broken record.

00:32.250 --> 00:33.650
Our job
was to protect them.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.087
Promised we'd
keep them safe.

00:37.189 --> 00:39.155
Now they're killed.

00:39.258 --> 00:40.557
7 years old.

00:40.659 --> 00:43.260
Finds his mom and dad...
covered in blood.

00:43.362 --> 00:46.229
- Hey. You okay?
- Yeah.

00:46.331 --> 00:48.531
You know,
just sounds awful.

00:48.634 --> 00:52.335
I can't meet you
in Greece, Kimmy.

00:52.437 --> 00:55.105
If somebody
tries to get you

00:55.207 --> 00:59.409
to go to a communist country
with them,

00:59.511 --> 01:01.511
don't.

01:06.385 --> 01:08.952
Oh, hi.

01:09.054 --> 01:11.788
Hi.

01:11.890 --> 01:13.690
How was work?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.394
Nothing new to report.

01:19.164 --> 01:21.231
Okay.

01:34.680 --> 01:37.113
I'm tired, going to bed.

01:37.215 --> 01:39.282
Stan came by.

01:42.721 --> 01:44.587
He was very upset about
a couple that was murdered

01:44.690 --> 01:47.057
right in front of
their seven-year-old kid.

01:47.159 --> 01:48.391
Defector and his wife.

01:48.493 --> 01:51.061
I didn't do it in front
of their kid.

01:51.163 --> 01:53.997
He was in another room.
I-I didn't see him.

01:54.099 --> 01:57.534
He saw them
covered in blood.

01:59.538 --> 02:01.271
What do you
want me to say?

02:03.108 --> 02:06.042
I'm not doing the thing
with Kimmy.

02:08.613 --> 02:11.014
Of course you aren't.

02:11.116 --> 02:12.749
You were never
going to do it.

02:12.851 --> 02:15.585
No, I was.

02:17.389 --> 02:19.255
You got me.

02:19.358 --> 02:21.324
Somehow you got me.

02:21.426 --> 02:22.759
You just wanted
to fuck her.

02:22.861 --> 02:24.527
You weren't getting
enough action here.

02:24.629 --> 02:26.029
You can think
whatever you want.

02:26.131 --> 02:29.165
Fine. I'll take care of Kimmy.
Don't agonize over it.

02:31.570 --> 02:35.905
I warned her not to go to
any communist countries.

02:37.442 --> 02:39.175
I'm never gonna
see her again.

02:39.277 --> 02:42.946
It's over.
That's over.

04:00.133 --> 04:01.567
The guy who showed up

04:01.669 --> 04:02.768
in the cream-colored
Rolls-Royce?

04:02.870 --> 04:04.236
That guy owns a motel?

04:04.338 --> 04:05.404
It's a wreck.

04:05.506 --> 04:06.972
But the mayor's good
to his friends.

04:07.074 --> 04:09.107
Gave the guy a city contract
to house DC's homeless there.

04:09.210 --> 04:11.477
Yeah, but that doesn't
buy you a Rolls.

04:11.579 --> 04:12.611
It does if
you let him slap

04:12.713 --> 04:13.846
a four-star rating
on the motel

04:13.948 --> 04:15.113
and get the city
to pay

04:15.216 --> 04:16.315
the new
room rates.

04:16.416 --> 04:17.850
Sorry to
interrupt...

04:17.952 --> 04:20.619
Hey, you guys know
Dennis Aderholt,

04:20.721 --> 04:22.053
he runs CI--

04:22.156 --> 04:24.389
the most screwed
up division in the Bureau.

04:25.693 --> 04:27.159
Not that
it's his fault.

04:27.261 --> 04:28.527
Thanks for that.

04:28.629 --> 04:31.096
I gotta talk to
you. Downstairs.

04:31.198 --> 04:32.197
I don't know,
man,

04:32.299 --> 04:33.298
every time I
go down there,

04:33.400 --> 04:34.299
someone
winds up dead.

04:34.401 --> 04:36.168
Easy there,
Stan.

05:10.271 --> 05:13.572
You got any more steam
you want to blow off?

05:13.674 --> 05:14.673
No.

05:14.775 --> 05:18.176
I mean,
get it out now.

05:19.747 --> 05:21.046
I'm fine.

05:38.933 --> 05:40.265
What's going on?

05:40.367 --> 05:42.434
Bystrov.

05:42.536 --> 05:44.403
Before he died.

05:44.505 --> 05:46.171
One of
his diplomatic pouches

05:46.273 --> 05:49.074
had a circuit board for
some kind of sensor in it.

05:49.176 --> 05:50.876
Sensor?

05:50.978 --> 05:53.879
Yeah, picks up
radioactivity, or...

05:53.981 --> 05:56.281
Brooks knows more about it,
ask him.

05:56.383 --> 05:58.450
Altheon makes them.

05:58.552 --> 06:00.285
They've got a plant
in Chicago,

06:00.387 --> 06:03.689
and a warehouse here
out in Newington.

06:03.791 --> 06:07.292
Eight days after Bystrov's
pouch leaves the country,

06:07.394 --> 06:09.695
there's a break-in
at the warehouse,

06:09.797 --> 06:13.098
- three guards get killed--
- Jesus.

06:13.200 --> 06:16.268
They're obviously after one of these
sensors, but they didn't get it.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.136
This circuit board
in Bystrov's pouch

06:18.238 --> 06:20.105
came from the Altheon plant
in Chicago.

06:20.207 --> 06:22.574
So our people out there started
looking at the employees,

06:22.676 --> 06:24.743
consultants, anyone
who could have had access.

06:24.845 --> 06:29.047
We get onto this one engineer.
Forty-two years old.

06:29.149 --> 06:32.584
He folds in like five minutes,
tells us about this man

06:32.686 --> 06:35.220
he met in a bar,
who ended up recruiting him.

06:35.322 --> 06:38.590
They were apparently
very intimate.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.059
No shit.

06:41.829 --> 06:43.595
So we had him set up
another meeting.

06:43.697 --> 06:46.465
Or date, whatever.

06:46.567 --> 06:48.133
We were there.

06:48.235 --> 06:50.268
An illegal?

06:54.908 --> 06:57.609
Codename, Harvest.

07:03.050 --> 07:06.318
Lives in Skokie, runs an
accounting business in Chicago.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.720
Him, two other accountants,
and a secretary.

07:09.923 --> 07:13.492
We've had a team on him out
there for almost two weeks now.

07:19.033 --> 07:21.433
It's been a gold mine.

07:21.535 --> 07:24.202
We've been getting all sorts
of intel on how he operates.

07:24.304 --> 07:27.272
Most of it's tradecraft
we've never seen before.

07:27.374 --> 07:31.510
We're starting to use it to
track down the rest of them.

07:31.612 --> 07:34.146
Now, I know you don't want
to be down here, Stan.

07:34.248 --> 07:35.847
But look what's going on.

07:35.949 --> 07:38.383
We got Rennhull,

07:38.485 --> 07:40.385
a key general
in the SDI program,

07:40.487 --> 07:42.454
once accused of
being a Soviet spy,

07:42.556 --> 07:44.623
commits suicide
in a public park.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.025
Then Bystrov and Sofia,
the--

07:47.127 --> 07:49.728
the sensor in his pouch...
this illegal...

07:49.830 --> 07:52.364
Burov shows up
out of nowhere...

07:52.466 --> 07:55.333
studying traffic,
or whatever it is...

07:55.436 --> 07:58.036
The Russians are sitting down
with us in public,

07:58.138 --> 08:00.572
trying to negotiate this big
treaty, but behind our backs,

08:00.674 --> 08:04.376
they're stealing our weapons
and our technology, as usual.

08:04.478 --> 08:05.911
They want to look peaceful,

08:06.013 --> 08:07.913
but, really, they're
just trying to screw us.

08:08.015 --> 08:10.515
We're close,
we're really close.

08:10.617 --> 08:13.085
We got this guy
in Chicago,

08:13.187 --> 08:14.720
we're gonna get the illegals
here and all over the country,

08:14.822 --> 08:16.188
based on what
we're learning.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.056
It's gonna happen fast.

08:18.158 --> 08:20.525
You've been mad about this
a long time.

08:20.627 --> 08:23.028
I get why.

08:23.130 --> 08:26.832
But this is it now.

08:26.934 --> 08:29.034
You should be here.

08:32.339 --> 08:35.340
Have your tickets ready,
please.

08:35.442 --> 08:37.476
Bus to New York.

08:45.285 --> 08:47.219
- Hey!
- Hey.

08:47.321 --> 08:48.420
How are you?

08:48.522 --> 08:49.821
- Oh, good. How are you?
- Good.

08:49.923 --> 08:52.958
- Hungry?
- Yeah.

08:54.962 --> 08:56.928
- Leave it. - Hey, stop. Keep
your eyes on the road.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.864
- Leave it.
- No.

09:01.401 --> 09:03.235
How're finals going?

09:03.337 --> 09:05.270
Oh,
everyone is panicking.

09:05.372 --> 09:07.139
- You?
- No.

09:07.241 --> 09:09.074
Me and a couple of guys
from my team

09:09.176 --> 09:11.943
started this study group,
so we're fine.

09:12.045 --> 09:15.313
I do have to finish
this Thoreau book, though,

09:15.415 --> 09:19.017
so don't be mad
if I'm stuck in my room.

09:27.261 --> 09:31.229
Dad, I don't-- I don't
want to leave school.

09:31.331 --> 09:34.266
I know you don't.
I know you don't.

09:34.368 --> 09:37.435
I'm doing the best I can,
Henry.

09:37.538 --> 09:40.906
I-- I talked to
Mr. Sato about it.

09:41.008 --> 09:44.142
And he said that there were
still a few scholarships

09:44.244 --> 09:45.977
- that I could apply for.
- Okay.

09:47.714 --> 09:49.748
Oh, also, I'm gonna get
a summer job.

09:53.921 --> 09:56.354
I know you're
trying to help,

09:56.456 --> 09:58.356
but, Henry, tuition alone
is almost nine thou--

09:58.458 --> 09:59.958
Nine thousand.

10:00.060 --> 10:04.296
I know, Dad, but I'm not talking
about a job at the mall.

10:04.398 --> 10:08.466
My friend Jason's dad owns
this tannery in West Virginia,

10:08.569 --> 10:12.604
and Jason goes down there
every year to work.

10:12.706 --> 10:15.807
And he said
I can come, too, so...

10:15.909 --> 10:20.178
Look, they pay seven-ten
an hour, and they put you up.

10:24.117 --> 10:28.053
Look, I-- I know
it's not enough,

10:28.155 --> 10:31.556
but I was thinking
there might be some stuff

10:31.658 --> 10:33.458
that we could do
to help the business.

10:33.560 --> 10:36.328
But don't get mad.

10:36.430 --> 10:37.896
What?

10:37.998 --> 10:41.166
Jason's dad owns
a couple of different companies.

10:41.268 --> 10:43.235
And I told him

10:43.337 --> 10:45.570
we were having some problems
with the travel agency.

10:45.672 --> 10:46.905
Henry...

10:47.007 --> 10:49.040
W-- Look, he was
totally cool with it.

10:49.142 --> 10:52.143
He said he'd had
a few failures himself.

10:52.246 --> 10:55.347
I-I haven't failed.
I haven't failed.

10:55.449 --> 10:58.049
I j--
All-- You--

10:58.151 --> 10:59.651
You told him I failed?

10:59.753 --> 11:03.588
No, but it doesn't matter.
He doesn't care.

11:03.690 --> 11:06.258
Look, he said he'd be happy
to talk to you about it

11:06.360 --> 11:07.659
and give you some advice.

11:07.761 --> 11:09.895
Well, I don't--
I don't know this guy.

11:09.997 --> 11:11.496
He's really nice.

11:11.598 --> 11:16.268
And you might end up, you know,
planning a trip for him.

11:16.370 --> 11:18.703
And then he'll tell
his rich friends,

11:18.805 --> 11:22.107
and then you'll have
more clients.

11:22.209 --> 11:23.675
Are you mad?

11:23.777 --> 11:26.278
No.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.514
I just wish you'd
talked to me... first.

11:29.616 --> 11:32.083
It wasn't like I was trying to talk
about it behind your back or anything.

11:32.185 --> 11:35.921
It was-- We were just talking
about the job and it came up.

11:36.023 --> 11:37.455
I'm sorry.

11:37.557 --> 11:41.159
Look, can you please
just talk to him?

11:42.896 --> 11:44.596
I don't know. Maybe.

11:44.698 --> 11:48.233
Dad, I busted my ass
for three years,

11:48.335 --> 11:50.769
and if I don't actually
graduate from St. Edward's,

11:50.871 --> 11:53.104
it doesn't mean anything.

11:53.206 --> 11:57.943
So please just
think about it, okay?

11:59.346 --> 12:01.046
Yeah.

12:01.148 --> 12:02.647
Thank you.

12:14.361 --> 12:17.228
Excuse me. Thanks.

12:21.335 --> 12:22.968
This is "Rififi," right?

12:23.070 --> 12:24.669
Uh, yeah.

12:24.771 --> 12:28.340
Oh, good. I walked into
"Bob Le Flambeur" by accident.

12:28.442 --> 12:30.141
It's a great movie, but...
I've already seen it.

12:30.243 --> 12:31.843
Oh.
You'll like this.

12:31.945 --> 12:33.211
Oh, you've seen it?

12:34.281 --> 12:36.114
Uh, thi-- third time.

12:36.216 --> 12:37.649
- Wow.
- Yeah.

12:37.751 --> 12:39.250
It's the greatest heist movie
in history.

12:40.587 --> 12:42.287
Can't believe
it's not more packed.

12:42.389 --> 12:44.489
Is anybody sitting here?

12:44.591 --> 12:47.993
- Oh, no. Go-- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

12:52.532 --> 12:54.165
I guess everyone's
saving their money

12:54.267 --> 12:55.633
for
"Three Men And A Baby."

12:55.736 --> 12:57.669
Yeah, right.

12:57.771 --> 13:00.305
Although the original,
<i>"Trois Hommes Et Un Couffin,"</i>

13:00.407 --> 13:02.140
isn't bad.

13:02.242 --> 13:05.110
Surprisingly good,
in fact.

13:06.947 --> 13:08.513
There are
thousands of places

13:08.615 --> 13:10.181
they could be renting
as garages here

13:10.283 --> 13:12.917
that match the kind of places we
tracked Harvest to in Chicago.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.020
We've found about two hundred
so far, to check out.

13:15.122 --> 13:16.621
We've cleared
a hundred and eighty.

13:16.723 --> 13:19.190
We're on the other twenty,
and we're trying to find more.

13:19.292 --> 13:21.493
- Can I hang on to this?
- Sure.

13:21.595 --> 13:23.328
Now, the guys in Chicago

13:23.430 --> 13:25.697
may have identified one
of Harvest's safehouses.

13:25.799 --> 13:29.000
Someone there is paying
the utilities in advance,

13:29.102 --> 13:31.636
so that could be how
they do things everywhere.

13:31.738 --> 13:33.705
We'll want to check
the utility records here,

13:33.807 --> 13:36.474
find out which accounts
are being paid the same way.

13:36.576 --> 13:39.077
Now, take Llewelyn and Vignau
if you need help.

13:39.179 --> 13:41.046
- Okay. - Come here. Let
me show you this.

13:41.148 --> 13:43.148
Hey, anything on
the wiretaps out there?

13:43.250 --> 13:45.250
Well, they've been
picking up something,

13:45.352 --> 13:48.353
maybe telemarketers,
maybe coded signals.

13:48.455 --> 13:49.988
Nothing definitive.

13:50.090 --> 13:53.992
But they figured out how
he gets some of his cars.

13:54.094 --> 13:57.762
They found two vehicles
in undercover garages.

13:57.864 --> 14:01.900
Both bought for cash, from
listings in the classified ads.

14:02.002 --> 14:03.001
Legally?

14:03.103 --> 14:05.036
Fake ID
on the registration.

14:05.138 --> 14:07.005
How the hell
do you track that?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.941
You track down the registration
of every single car

14:10.043 --> 14:12.177
bought with cash
in the DC area.

14:13.613 --> 14:18.349
Anything sold from a newspaper
ad, a <i> Pennysaver, Autotrader...</i>

14:18.452 --> 14:21.719
you start in 1987,
work back to '78--

14:21.822 --> 14:24.222
you pull together a list
of likely fake IDs,

14:24.324 --> 14:26.124
you cross-reference them
with the rest

14:26.226 --> 14:28.860
of what we're getting from
the illegals' tradecraft...

14:28.962 --> 14:34.299
maybe they used the same name
on a lease or a utility bill...

14:34.401 --> 14:36.468
Why don't you
take this one, Stan--

14:36.570 --> 14:38.770
work with Samuels.

14:40.540 --> 14:42.073
Lotta cars.

14:42.909 --> 14:46.244
You can pull in as many guys
as you need on this.

14:53.920 --> 14:56.121
And that heist,
I mean what was that?

14:56.223 --> 14:58.890
- Like a half-hour of silence?
- Twenty-eight minutes.

14:58.992 --> 15:00.258
- It's incredible.
- I know.

15:00.360 --> 15:02.227
- I couldn't believe it.
- I know.

15:02.329 --> 15:03.828
Uh, uh, smoke?

15:03.930 --> 15:06.064
I can't say no
after a French movie.

15:07.501 --> 15:08.766
- Thanks.
- He's, uh, not French.

15:08.869 --> 15:10.301
- Who?
- He's not French.

15:10.403 --> 15:12.504
- The-- The director.
- Oh.

15:12.606 --> 15:14.572
Jules Dassin.

15:14.674 --> 15:16.808
Here you go.

15:18.111 --> 15:20.912
Thanks.
Grew up in Harlem.

15:21.014 --> 15:22.814
Then was then blacklisted
by McCarthy,

15:22.916 --> 15:24.649
so that's why he had to go
and work in France.

15:24.751 --> 15:26.451
- Crazy.
- Yeah.

15:26.553 --> 15:27.852
- Have you seen "The Naked City"?
- No.

15:27.954 --> 15:30.155
Okay. That's him too.
It's film noir.

15:30.257 --> 15:33.158
It's shot completely on
location in New York in 1948,

15:33.260 --> 15:35.293
when, like, no one did that.
It's really amazing.

15:35.395 --> 15:38.496
- You know a lot about film.
- Yeah.

15:38.598 --> 15:40.765
It's the greatest art form
of the 20th century.

15:41.968 --> 15:45.970
I was gonna go get some pizza.
You want to tell me more?

15:48.041 --> 15:50.842
I have to be up really early
for work.

15:50.944 --> 15:52.844
But it was good
talking to you, though.

15:52.946 --> 15:55.113
- You too.
- Yeah.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
- Hi.
- Hey, Mom.

16:19.673 --> 16:21.472
Can I bum one?

16:28.348 --> 16:30.682
Whoa. What are you--
Mom, what are you doing?

16:30.784 --> 16:33.418
No. Holy shit, I was jo--
I was joking.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.354
Put them away. Are you
trying to give me cancer?

16:40.460 --> 16:41.993
So, you been
smoking a lot?

16:43.096 --> 16:45.763
I smoke.

16:45.865 --> 16:47.498
I always smoked.

16:47.601 --> 16:51.035
It relaxes me.

16:51.137 --> 16:52.403
I get it.

16:55.709 --> 16:58.810
I guess I smoke more now
than I used to.

17:00.814 --> 17:02.247
But you're
an adult now.

17:02.349 --> 17:04.682
I don't have to hide things
from you anymore.

17:07.721 --> 17:08.920
Did you eat anything?

17:09.021 --> 17:11.089
No, not really.

17:11.191 --> 17:13.891
I'll make you something.

17:13.993 --> 17:16.327
Okay.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.512
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

17:58.098 --> 18:00.998
Morning.

18:01.101 --> 18:03.167
You're up early.

18:03.269 --> 18:05.269
Yeah.

18:13.213 --> 18:14.612
Is Paige home?

18:14.714 --> 18:16.514
I don't think so.
Why?

18:16.616 --> 18:18.149
Someone was sleeping
in her bed last night.

18:18.251 --> 18:20.184
I was just wondering.

18:20.286 --> 18:22.887
That was Mom.
She had to get up early...

18:28.962 --> 18:32.196
Mm. Aren't you
late for work?

18:33.933 --> 18:36.234
Yeah.

18:36.336 --> 18:38.136
Unless...

18:38.238 --> 18:41.139
I am the boss.

18:45.311 --> 18:46.744
How'd he wind up
in the hospital?

18:46.846 --> 18:49.013
His shirt was off in the tray
over the back wheel.

18:51.985 --> 18:54.819
And then, uh, it slipped
into the spokes.

18:58.458 --> 19:00.892
- Man.
- Another wipeout.

19:00.994 --> 19:03.327
Alright,
let's try it again, okay?

19:03.429 --> 19:04.762
Thanks.

19:04.864 --> 19:07.498
Yeah, he lost control
of the bike,

19:07.600 --> 19:11.035
and he flew over
the handle bars.

19:11.137 --> 19:13.504
And he smashed his hip
into a metal pole.

19:13.606 --> 19:15.907
That's terrible.

19:16.009 --> 19:17.875
Yeah, the doctor said that it
was like the equivalent

19:17.977 --> 19:19.043
of stepping on a cracker.

19:19.145 --> 19:20.545
Thanks.

19:20.647 --> 19:22.013
He gonna be alright?

19:22.115 --> 19:23.781
I don't know, I hope so.

19:23.883 --> 19:27.218
Five more laps to go.

19:28.688 --> 19:32.290
Can't even walk, either, so he's
not gonna be back into school

19:32.392 --> 19:33.524
until after Christmas.

19:36.362 --> 19:38.429
Fuck!

19:38.531 --> 19:40.398
I got it.

19:40.500 --> 19:43.601
Car 3 did not slow down.

19:49.175 --> 19:51.142
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19:51.244 --> 19:52.710
Sorry.

19:52.812 --> 19:54.378
Is it work?

19:54.480 --> 19:58.049
Uhh... no.
I mean, yeah, yes, but...

19:59.886 --> 20:01.419
Is it Mom?

20:01.521 --> 20:03.888
- What do you mean?
- I don't know.

20:03.990 --> 20:05.923
It's just that you
don't really talk or...

20:06.025 --> 20:08.793
Henry,
everything's fine.

20:08.895 --> 20:10.628
Look, I love your mother.
She loves me.

20:10.730 --> 20:12.730
It's just, sometimes...

20:14.367 --> 20:15.566
Everything's fine.

20:17.270 --> 20:19.170
Okay.

20:25.945 --> 20:28.179
<i>Orange Line train
to Vienna/Fairfax.</i>

20:28.281 --> 20:30.514
<i>Next stop, McPherson Square.</i>

20:30.617 --> 20:32.984
<i>Doors open on the right.</i>

20:43.963 --> 20:45.638
"Rififi."

20:45.740 --> 20:47.465
Oh, yeah.

20:47.567 --> 20:50.935
I haven't seen
"The Naked City" yet.

20:51.037 --> 20:53.004
Oh, hey, you've got to.
You've got to.

20:53.106 --> 20:55.181
Yeah, I know.
Too much work.

20:55.283 --> 20:57.850
I know.
Yeah, tell me about it.

20:57.952 --> 21:00.019
What do you do?

21:00.121 --> 21:04.490
Um, I'm a-- I'm an intern for,
um, Sam Nunn, the senator.

21:04.592 --> 21:07.026
- Oh, I know Sam.
- You do?

21:07.128 --> 21:09.895
Well, not directly, but he works
with some people in my firm.

21:09.998 --> 21:12.698
Oh.
W-Which firm's that?

21:12.800 --> 21:14.667
McAlraith.

21:14.769 --> 21:16.969
Yeah, I think I--
Yeah, I've heard of them.

21:17.071 --> 21:19.405
Um... what is it--
What is it you guys do again?

21:19.507 --> 21:21.474
Consulting.

21:21.576 --> 21:24.310
Which no one ever really knows what
that means, but...

21:24.412 --> 21:27.079
Corporate strategizing,
management advice...

21:27.181 --> 21:30.650
Okay. So what-- what does that
all have to do with Senator Nunn?

21:30.752 --> 21:33.152
Well, someone has to tell him
what to do.

21:33.254 --> 21:35.087
I'm kidding.
Sort of.

21:35.189 --> 21:37.356
Right.

21:49.170 --> 21:51.904
<i>Orange Line train
to Vienna/Fairfax.</i>

21:52.006 --> 21:54.106
<i>Next stop...</i>

21:54.208 --> 21:57.009
So, your friends
don't like foreign films?

21:59.013 --> 22:00.913
Uh, no.
No, not really.

22:01.015 --> 22:03.916
Yeah. It was the same
when I was younger.

22:04.018 --> 22:06.185
I always had to go alone.

22:06.287 --> 22:09.588
So, you planning on
getting into politics?

22:11.292 --> 22:13.559
Not-- Not really my thing. Mm.

22:13.661 --> 22:15.194
Just I'm-- I'm just kind of
here for the semester.

22:15.296 --> 22:16.729
Putting off going home
to work for my dad.

22:16.831 --> 22:19.365
What's he do?

22:19.467 --> 22:22.268
We make pavement sealers
and maintenance products.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.937
And you don't find that
interesting?

22:28.176 --> 22:29.809
Well, let's
just put it this way.

22:29.911 --> 22:33.245
- No one in Marietta, Georgia,
is going to "Rififi." - Right.

22:33.348 --> 22:34.980
But, you know, it's-- it's not
like they're backwards.

22:35.083 --> 22:37.049
- It's just kind of like a
very small town. - Yeah.

22:37.151 --> 22:39.318
You know, like, the, uh--
the one big family trip we took

22:39.420 --> 22:41.954
was to, like, London once
when I was 15.

22:42.056 --> 22:44.457
That must have been exciting.

22:44.559 --> 22:47.727
Yeah, uh... I came back home
with an English accent.

22:47.829 --> 22:50.463
You know, my Dad couldn't stop

22:50.565 --> 22:52.164
talking about how
"They drive

22:52.266 --> 22:54.767
on the wrong side of the
street" the whole time.

22:56.938 --> 23:00.172
You know what?
You should give me a call.

23:00.274 --> 23:02.641
McAlraith's a cool place.

23:02.744 --> 23:05.244
Your dad would be really impressed
with the business side of it.

23:05.346 --> 23:08.180
But we also figure out ways to
bring culture to corporations--

23:08.282 --> 23:09.749
make them more human.

23:09.851 --> 23:13.152
And we've got a great management
training program.

23:13.254 --> 23:15.121
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:15.223 --> 23:17.323
<i>Farragut West.</i>

23:17.425 --> 23:20.326
And besides, us film nerds
need to stick together.

23:20.428 --> 23:22.261
What's your name?

23:22.363 --> 23:24.096
Oh, it's Jackson. Barber.

23:24.198 --> 23:25.364
Give me a call, Jackson.

23:27.568 --> 23:29.769
Excuse me. Sorry.

23:30.204 --> 23:32.638
Oh.
Hold that, please?

23:38.579 --> 23:41.046
Uh, you wanted to see me,
Mr. Philip?

23:41.149 --> 23:43.182
Yeah, um...

23:43.284 --> 23:45.918
Have a seat, Stavos.

23:55.997 --> 23:59.799
As you know, we've been
under pressure lately.

24:00.835 --> 24:02.501
And the bottom line is...

24:02.603 --> 24:04.270
I-- I know this.

24:05.139 --> 24:06.338
You do?

24:07.408 --> 24:09.041
I know you, Mr. Philip.

24:09.143 --> 24:12.044
I see stress on your face
all the time.

24:12.146 --> 24:14.480
Yeah, it's--
it's been a hard year.

24:14.582 --> 24:16.215
Really hard.

24:17.919 --> 24:20.019
I'm gonna have to
let some people go.

24:20.121 --> 24:22.655
Oh, no.

24:22.757 --> 24:25.758
I've been over the books
a thousand times.

24:25.860 --> 24:28.427
There's no way around it.

24:28.529 --> 24:33.065
And I wanted... you to be
one of the first to hear

24:33.167 --> 24:35.267
because you've been here
a long time.

24:35.369 --> 24:40.539
And I think of you as a friend,
Stavos.

24:42.777 --> 24:45.077
Wait. Uh...

24:45.179 --> 24:48.514
Me? You--
You're firing me?

24:49.717 --> 24:51.917
You and Lacey and Steve.

24:52.019 --> 24:56.222
I-- I looked at everyone,
and I just had to see

24:56.324 --> 24:59.458
who wasn't pulling their weight
on the sales side.

24:59.560 --> 25:02.661
I'm-- I'm so sorry,
Stavos.

25:26.157 --> 25:28.124
Hey, where you going?
They got me outnumbered.

25:28.226 --> 25:29.459
I have to take a shower.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.794
We'll be done by then.
Just wash your hands.

25:31.896 --> 25:33.963
Mom, can you preheat
the oven? Three-fifty?

25:41.873 --> 25:43.606
We need to
make them into crumbs.

25:47.212 --> 25:50.480
Hello?
This is Mrs. Jennings.

25:52.851 --> 25:54.917
Alright. Thank you.

25:56.788 --> 26:00.189
That was work.
I have to go.

26:00.291 --> 26:02.992
We can handle
the rest.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.360
I'll be back
as soon as I can.

26:10.301 --> 26:12.435
We have someone
in Chicago.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.337
Just sent
an emergency signal.

26:14.439 --> 26:16.973
He's under surveillance.

26:17.075 --> 26:19.142
See if you can
get him out.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.944
Apparently,
he's been working on

26:22.046 --> 26:23.946
whatever it is
you're working on.

26:24.048 --> 26:26.516
Mexico.

26:26.618 --> 26:30.853
It means
he can't get arrested.

26:30.955 --> 26:34.757
Bulgaria isn't gonna happen.
Philip wouldn't do it.

26:36.594 --> 26:40.730
We need to talk
strategy about Nesterenko

26:40.832 --> 26:42.198
as soon as
you get back.

26:44.402 --> 26:47.570
I may have someone
in Sam Nunn's office.

26:47.672 --> 26:50.106
Good.

27:12.997 --> 27:14.063
Where are you going?

27:14.165 --> 27:15.665
Chicago.

27:15.767 --> 27:19.368
Now? That's not gonna look good.
It's Thanksgiving.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.404
Figure it out.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.506
What's going on?

27:27.145 --> 27:30.346
We should talk, because it's better
not to let bad feelings fester.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.282
You can take your Forum bullshit,
and you can shove it up your ass.

27:33.384 --> 27:36.719
One of us is in trouble
in Chicago, Philip.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.889
I'm going there to help him.
Someone who's doing his job.

27:39.991 --> 27:42.825
Someone who still
gives a shit.

27:59.644 --> 28:01.043
You sure I can't come?

28:02.046 --> 28:04.313
It would raise too much
suspicion at Stan's.

28:04.415 --> 28:05.815
Should I--

28:05.917 --> 28:08.217
Houston,
business emergency.

28:08.319 --> 28:11.454
- Okay.
- I'll see you when I get back.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.959
Bye, Mom.

28:25.670 --> 28:28.170
So, how's it
going at school?

28:28.273 --> 28:31.841
It's good. You know, just
classes, hockey, the usual.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.009
Girls?

28:34.612 --> 28:36.078
Oh? Anyone, uh...

28:36.180 --> 28:39.749
Well, I dated this one girl
for a bit, but...

28:39.851 --> 28:41.417
didn't really last long.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.685
Oh. Why not?

28:42.787 --> 28:44.687
I have no idea.

28:44.789 --> 28:47.323
You want to come up and
interrogate her, though?

28:47.425 --> 28:49.125
The wine's poured.

28:49.227 --> 28:50.593
We put the baby to sleep.

28:50.695 --> 28:51.861
Did he help?

28:51.963 --> 28:53.362
Are you kidding?

28:53.464 --> 28:55.197
I coached.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.800
Oh, and Dennis. Thanks
for putting in a good word.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.835
- Oh, sure.
- Is this about the job?

28:59.938 --> 29:01.170
Yeah.

29:01.272 --> 29:02.972
I can't believe it.
Dennis told me.

29:03.074 --> 29:04.774
You want to go
to the dark side?

29:04.876 --> 29:08.611
That's what I said.

29:10.114 --> 29:11.547
Hey.

29:11.649 --> 29:14.517
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Thanks. Come in, come in.

29:14.619 --> 29:17.353
- Thanks. Hi, Stan.
- Oh, thank you.

29:17.455 --> 29:19.555
Yeah.

29:19.657 --> 29:22.325
Perfect timing.
Where's Elizabeth?

29:22.427 --> 29:25.461
Hi. Oh.
On her way to Houston.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.129
- Oh no.
- Oh, what happened?

29:27.231 --> 29:31.067
We have this client,
organized a big family reunion.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.736
The damn airline stranded

29:33.838 --> 29:36.906
Uncle Somebody and
Cousin Whoever in Atlanta.

29:37.008 --> 29:39.141
He's pissed.
He's a CEO,

29:39.243 --> 29:40.910
one of our biggest clients,
threatened to drop us.

29:41.012 --> 29:42.411
He finally agreed
to meet her,

29:42.513 --> 29:44.814
but she has to
fly down there. So...

29:44.916 --> 29:47.016
- Oh, that's too bad...
- Yeah.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.318
I know how it is
when work gets in the way.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.354
We'll make sure she gets
leftovers, at least...

29:51.456 --> 29:52.655
Great.

29:53.624 --> 29:55.758
All right,
everybody to the table.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.159
Wow.

30:05.803 --> 30:09.605
Uh, hi.
Hi, everybody.

30:09.707 --> 30:12.441
I'm sorry not everyone
could be here today.

30:12.543 --> 30:15.344
But I am grateful
to be with friends.

30:18.483 --> 30:20.449
And family.

30:21.652 --> 30:26.255
Grateful for everything
we have in this country.

30:27.325 --> 30:29.525
You know, not everybody
around the world

30:29.627 --> 30:31.727
wants us to be able
to live in peace.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.796
And freedom.

30:33.898 --> 30:35.364
But aren't those the things

30:35.466 --> 30:37.833
the Pilgrims came here for
in the first place?

30:39.037 --> 30:40.603
You ask me,
we should all be willing

30:40.705 --> 30:42.505
to fight to hold onto them.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.909
Because there are people
out there

30:47.011 --> 30:49.779
who don't like
our way of life...

30:52.683 --> 30:55.818
They're afraid of it.
Of us.

30:56.988 --> 30:58.821
And we have an administration
right now--

30:58.923 --> 31:00.790
President Reagan
and his people...

31:00.892 --> 31:04.293
they know that the only way
to get to peace

31:04.395 --> 31:08.497
is to stand firm
against those who wish us harm.

31:08.599 --> 31:10.766
And believe me,
they do wish us harm.

31:10.868 --> 31:12.768
Make no mistake about that.

31:21.679 --> 31:23.412
Happy Thanksgiving.

31:23.514 --> 31:25.915
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Happy Thanksgiving.

31:26.017 --> 31:28.084
Cheers.

31:31.522 --> 31:33.989
Okay. Let's eat.

31:34.092 --> 31:36.792
- Sweet potatoes.
- Pass these down.

34:38.121 --> 34:41.656
I wish his commute was
a little less straightforward.

34:41.757 --> 34:43.925
Makes it easy
for them to cover.

34:44.027 --> 34:46.460
But we should be able
to get him right here.

34:47.597 --> 34:50.331
This plan,

34:50.434 --> 34:52.567
I don't know...

34:54.971 --> 34:58.406
Just between us, what are the
chances we'll pull this off?

35:01.078 --> 35:03.311
Not great.

35:19.796 --> 35:22.530
You should get Erica
more patchouli oil.

35:22.632 --> 35:24.332
Patchouli oil?

35:24.434 --> 35:26.568
She likes having her feet
rubbed with it.

35:26.670 --> 35:28.837
She let you
touch her feet?

35:36.246 --> 35:38.613
You should get some rest.
We both should.

35:39.749 --> 35:41.850
Yeah.

36:53.857 --> 36:56.291
- How's it going?
- Oh.

36:56.393 --> 37:00.461
We got fifty guys spread out in
seven offices working the phones.

37:00.564 --> 37:02.330
Don't ever buy your car
from <i> Pennysaver.</i>

37:02.432 --> 37:03.998
It's not a completely
reputable bunch.

37:04.100 --> 37:07.335
- Hey, we just need one hit...
- Yeah.

37:07.437 --> 37:10.305
And listen, can you handle
this without Samuels?

37:10.407 --> 37:12.574
I need him to help
with the priests.

37:12.676 --> 37:14.175
Priests?

37:14.277 --> 37:15.977
Yeah, they saw Harvest

37:16.079 --> 37:18.513
meeting with a Russian Orthodox
priest last week,

37:18.615 --> 37:20.648
so we're looking at the ones
around here.

37:20.750 --> 37:22.350
Okay.

37:22.452 --> 37:26.521
Hey. Yesterday.
That-- That was nice.

37:26.623 --> 37:28.189
- Yeah.
- Sorry about the rug.

37:28.291 --> 37:29.691
Oh, it'll come out.

37:29.793 --> 37:31.593
Renee is so crazy
about Calvin,

37:31.695 --> 37:34.362
he could pour a bowl of soup on
the rug, she wouldn't mind.

37:35.899 --> 37:38.600
So, y-you guys
thinking maybe...?

37:38.702 --> 37:42.070
Uh, we're pretty old,
Dennis.

37:44.140 --> 37:46.341
- Emily's sweet potatoes.
- Hey, hey!

37:46.443 --> 37:47.942
Mm. Finally.

37:55.552 --> 37:56.551
Hello?

37:56.653 --> 37:59.153
Hi. It's Mom.

37:59.256 --> 38:02.323
Hey, Mom. Uh, Dad's
not home right now.

38:02.425 --> 38:04.726
Th-That's okay.
I'm calling for you.

38:06.329 --> 38:11.633
Oh... uh, great.
Okay.

38:11.735 --> 38:13.968
How's Houston?

38:14.070 --> 38:17.038
Um... hot.

38:19.175 --> 38:20.541
How's everything there?

38:20.644 --> 38:23.678
Cold. But it's better
than New Hampshire.

38:23.780 --> 38:28.483
Well... h-how's
everything going?

38:28.585 --> 38:31.386
Uh, it's okay.
School's good.

38:31.488 --> 38:36.090
It can be great sometimes
and a drag others.

38:36.192 --> 38:39.861
Do you have
a favorite class this year?

38:39.963 --> 38:42.530
Uh... American Lit,
I guess,

38:42.632 --> 38:45.366
but we're reading a book
right now called "Walden,"

38:45.468 --> 38:50.338
and it is literally the most
boring book ever written.

38:50.440 --> 38:51.939
I ne-- I never read it.

38:52.042 --> 38:55.043
Well, it's about this guy
who sits at a pond

38:55.145 --> 38:58.680
and just thinks about
how boring it is.

39:02.285 --> 39:04.686
Why do they
have you read that?

39:04.788 --> 39:06.220
I don't know.

39:06.323 --> 39:10.191
It's important literature,
apparently.

39:12.295 --> 39:14.028
Got any girlfriends?

39:15.298 --> 39:18.066
Uh, working on it.

39:21.471 --> 39:24.038
Well, uh...

39:24.140 --> 39:26.474
Okay.

39:26.576 --> 39:28.476
Yeah.

39:28.578 --> 39:30.445
Yeah.

39:32.148 --> 39:34.782
Okay.
Good night, Henry.

39:34.884 --> 39:36.417
Good night.

40:05.548 --> 40:07.181
Is that the last piece?

40:07.283 --> 40:08.483
Second to last.

40:08.585 --> 40:10.952
Whew.

40:11.054 --> 40:12.754
Oh. Mom called.

40:13.590 --> 40:15.456
What'd she say?

40:15.558 --> 40:17.158
She called for me.

40:19.462 --> 40:21.295
That's nice.

40:21.398 --> 40:23.030
Yeah.

40:23.133 --> 40:26.567
But she was asking about,
like, school and the weather.

40:28.037 --> 40:29.871
It was weird.

40:29.973 --> 40:32.640
'Cause she never
really calls me.

40:32.742 --> 40:34.442
We barely ever talk.

40:34.544 --> 40:37.545
But all of a sudden, she's
calling me from a business trip

40:37.647 --> 40:41.115
and asking
about English class...

40:41.217 --> 40:44.419
I don't know.
Whatever.

40:44.521 --> 40:47.488
I just really don't understand
why she's so unhappy.

40:48.558 --> 40:49.791
What?

40:49.893 --> 40:52.126
I don't understand
why she's so unhappy.

40:52.228 --> 40:54.996
She has a nice life,
right?

40:55.098 --> 40:57.298
Yeah.

40:57.400 --> 40:59.534
I think so.

42:32.729 --> 42:35.563
Hello?

42:35.665 --> 42:37.999
Hi.

42:38.101 --> 42:40.334
Hi...

42:40.436 --> 42:43.070
Is everything okay?

42:43.172 --> 42:45.406
Yeah.
I just, uh...

42:45.508 --> 42:50.111
Just calling to see
if everything's all right.

42:50.213 --> 42:51.479
I don't know.

42:54.183 --> 42:55.483
Not really.

42:57.420 --> 42:58.619
What do you mean?

42:58.721 --> 43:02.990
It's just
a, uh... hard one.

43:07.397 --> 43:09.797
You might
lose the client?

43:09.899 --> 43:14.835
I'm not sure I can accomplish
what I came here for without...

43:17.273 --> 43:19.273
Just gonna be tough.

43:23.212 --> 43:25.813
Without what?

43:25.915 --> 43:28.015
More help.

43:30.286 --> 43:32.820
Are you asking me
to come?

43:32.922 --> 43:36.090
I'll handle it. This is
my side of the business.

43:39.495 --> 43:43.364
I don't think that's been
working these last few months.

43:43.466 --> 43:47.702
A-And he's not the only client
in the world.

43:49.305 --> 43:52.373
Why don't you come home?

43:55.845 --> 43:57.645
What's happened to you?

43:58.815 --> 44:00.815
Nothing.

44:00.917 --> 44:02.750
Still the same asshole
as always.

44:02.852 --> 44:05.319
Doesn't care about anyone
but himself, right?

44:05.421 --> 44:08.990
I'm not coming home.

44:10.693 --> 44:13.361
Okay.

44:13.463 --> 44:16.664
I'll come.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.635
N-Nobody's asking you
to do that.

44:22.972 --> 44:24.905
I know.

44:25.008 --> 44:27.541
Just sit tight.

44:27.644 --> 44:29.577
I'm on my way.
