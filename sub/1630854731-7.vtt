WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:02.785
Scraps, come on!
We're gonna be late

00:02.785 --> 00:04.482
for the dress-your-pet contest.

00:07.268 --> 00:08.965
This sucks.

00:08.965 --> 00:10.662
All my friends
are gonna be there.

00:10.662 --> 00:13.404
Tinker Bell and Jaja are gonna
think I'm a friggin' jackass.

00:13.404 --> 00:15.450
You look adorable!

00:15.450 --> 00:17.626
Now waggle your widdle stinger
for Mommy.

00:17.626 --> 00:20.411
Look, I am sick of
embarrassing myself

00:20.411 --> 00:22.239
for your own
private amusement.

00:22.239 --> 00:23.675
I'm a man, damn it.

00:23.675 --> 00:25.329
Hey, you're getting
a little unruly, boy.

00:25.329 --> 00:26.374
Sit.
No.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.592
I'm serious.
I don't wanna.

00:27.592 --> 00:30.030
Sit.

00:30.030 --> 00:32.597
Now shake.

00:32.597 --> 00:35.252
Look at me.

00:35.252 --> 00:39.082
There's my good boy!

00:39.082 --> 00:41.258
You know what
would be so cute?

00:41.258 --> 00:42.694
A little jar of honey.

00:42.694 --> 00:44.957
I'll be right back,
my little bumblebee.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.134
Mom! Come--

00:47.134 --> 00:48.918
It's not fair.

00:48.918 --> 00:51.834
Is it too much to ask for
a little dignity and respect?

00:51.834 --> 00:54.054
Let go!

00:54.054 --> 00:55.359
Get him in there!

00:55.359 --> 00:57.274
Ow!

00:57.274 --> 00:59.276
Go, go, go!

01:02.236 --> 01:04.629
Scraps!

01:04.629 --> 01:06.240
Scraps?

01:16.293 --> 01:18.165
Bad news, guys.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.341
Lenny from Accounting died,

01:20.341 --> 01:22.647
Which means we're a man short
on our kickball team,

01:22.647 --> 01:25.911
and we're gonna have to
forfeit the game this weekend.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.044
I know.
It's a tragedy.

01:28.044 --> 01:29.524
The kickball part, I mean.

01:29.524 --> 01:31.178
Morning, everyone.
So sorry I'm late.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.049
Uh, Freya needed to use the car
this morning,

01:33.049 --> 01:34.964
so I had to take the bus,
and the bus was delayed.

01:34.964 --> 01:36.705
And then it finally got there,
and, surprise, surprise,

01:36.705 --> 01:38.446
we were ambushed
by child soldiers.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.752
Whoa. Sid, you can't
just burst in here

01:40.752 --> 01:42.232
sweating like a desert pig.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.974
We have an image to uphold
in this office.

01:44.974 --> 01:47.933
For instance, when you look
at me, what do you see?

01:47.933 --> 01:50.675
Oh, um, an odd little man
in a top hat?

01:50.675 --> 01:51.894
I was gonna say success.

01:51.894 --> 01:53.287
Success? Yes.

01:53.287 --> 01:56.507
Whereas when people look at you,
they see bus.

01:56.507 --> 02:00.903
Freaking epic slam
from the boss man.

02:00.903 --> 02:03.210
Thank you, Devon.
I like you today.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.994
Get yourself cleaned up.

02:04.994 --> 02:06.865
And you might want to take those
tiny knives out of your back.

02:06.865 --> 02:09.564
What? Oh! Ow!

02:09.564 --> 02:11.479
Stupid child soldiers.

02:11.479 --> 02:13.220
Aah!

02:13.220 --> 02:15.744
Oh, work with me, man.
I'm sure we can work out a deal.

02:15.744 --> 02:17.572
Let me go, and in exchange,

02:17.572 --> 02:20.140
I'll report you and send
your asses to prison!

02:23.055 --> 02:24.840
Roland!

02:24.840 --> 02:27.582
You're home.

02:27.582 --> 02:29.366
Mwah!
Oh, I'm sorry, lady,

02:29.366 --> 02:31.151
but I think you're giving
the wrong guy a boner.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.022
Look, I-I'm not Roland.

02:33.022 --> 02:34.502
My-- my name is Scraps.

02:34.502 --> 02:37.722
Oh, you poor thing.
You must have been brainwashed.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.594
You are Roland Proudheart.

02:39.594 --> 02:40.986
You saved our whole village

02:40.986 --> 02:44.120
from the evil warlord
Freya Exaltada.

02:44.120 --> 02:47.384
But I never gave up hope that
we'd find you again one day.

02:49.604 --> 02:53.782
Why is everyone nodding at me
with warmth and admiration?

02:53.782 --> 02:55.740
Because they respect you.

02:55.740 --> 02:59.396
You are our brave leader,
my beloved husband,

02:59.396 --> 03:01.833
and a wonderful father.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.400
I'm a father?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.707
Kids, come say hi
to your dad.

03:05.707 --> 03:08.927
Father!
We missed you so.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.060
My children!

03:11.060 --> 03:13.367
Come to papa!

03:18.241 --> 03:19.808
Yeah, what do you think
of this one?

03:19.808 --> 03:21.157
Pretty good condition.

03:21.157 --> 03:22.767
A few dings here and there, obviously.

03:22.767 --> 03:24.726
You're joking, right?
It doesn't have any wheels.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.380
That's fine.
I can just lift it over my waist

03:26.380 --> 03:28.643
and run, like this.

03:28.643 --> 03:31.298
No!
We can do better than that.

03:31.298 --> 03:35.215
Okay.
How about this one?

03:35.215 --> 03:37.652
This car is actively on fire.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.654
It might knock
the price down.

03:39.654 --> 03:42.309
Sid, you can't drive around
in a piece of crap.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.746
No, you need something
with some swagger, you know?

03:44.746 --> 03:45.921
Like--

03:45.921 --> 03:49.577
Ah! Like this.

03:49.577 --> 03:51.143
What a beauty.

03:51.143 --> 03:54.451
Now, this is a car!

03:54.451 --> 03:56.453
Is it a car?

03:56.453 --> 03:58.020
It's a Bifi.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.457
It gets great mileage,
doesn't require fossil fuels,

04:00.457 --> 04:03.765
and, most importantly,
it is baller AF.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.812
I mean,
it's definitely cool.

04:07.812 --> 04:09.336
Big thighs.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.120
Solid bulge.

04:11.120 --> 04:12.861
But, yeah,
I-I-I don't know, man.

04:12.861 --> 04:14.689
I just-- I don't think
I can pull it off.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.038
I'm not that kind of guy.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.301
Sid, you need more confidence
than that.

04:18.301 --> 04:21.304
Just jump in, huh?
See how it feels.

04:21.304 --> 04:24.046
Um, how do I, uh--
Oh.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.658
Oh. Oh. Okay.

04:27.658 --> 04:29.051
Alright.

04:29.051 --> 04:31.096
Ooh! It's, uh--

04:31.096 --> 04:33.621
Wow!
Yeah, that's pretty nice.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.971
You feel powerful.
Oh, and the seat's warm.

04:35.971 --> 04:37.364
Feels good, right?

04:37.364 --> 04:39.279
Do you want me to ask
about a payment plan?

04:39.279 --> 04:40.845
No. No need.

04:40.845 --> 04:43.195
I will be paying
in bird beaks.

04:45.894 --> 04:47.461
Oh-ho!

04:47.461 --> 04:50.420
Listen to this baby purr.

04:50.420 --> 04:53.380
Puppet Freya:
I am the evil witch Freya!

04:53.380 --> 04:58.515
I'm going to burn your village
to the ground!

04:58.515 --> 05:00.038
Boo!

05:00.038 --> 05:02.519
Not if I have anything
to say about it!

05:04.173 --> 05:05.522
Oh, no!

05:05.522 --> 05:09.744
Not Roland!
Nyah!

05:09.744 --> 05:11.267
Damn, I'm awesome!

05:11.267 --> 05:13.661
Roland? Why are you sitting
on the ground?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.924
You sit at the head
of the table.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.578
Oh, right. Yeah.

05:17.578 --> 05:20.494
'Cause in your eyes, I'm a man
and not a subhuman animal.

05:23.975 --> 05:25.673
What would you like to eat?

05:25.673 --> 05:28.153
I'm-- I'm sorry.
I can have whatever I want?

05:28.153 --> 05:31.548
Mm-hmm.
Can I have ice cream?

05:31.548 --> 05:32.854
Your iced cream, Father.

05:32.854 --> 05:36.379
Wowie-zowie!

05:36.379 --> 05:40.818
Someone's gonna be
barfin' tonight!

05:40.818 --> 05:44.344
Why don't you, uh, save some of
that appetite for the bedroom.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.998
Oh. I think I follow.

05:46.998 --> 05:48.870
I get to sleep in the bed.

05:48.870 --> 05:50.437
Oh, Roland!

05:50.437 --> 05:54.223
You still have your same
dry sense of humor.

05:54.223 --> 05:58.009
I'll boil your bones
to make my broth! Nyah!

05:58.009 --> 05:59.446
Is that supposed to be me?

05:59.446 --> 06:01.361
That's not what
I sound like.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.797
Nyah!

06:02.797 --> 06:04.276
Freya.

06:04.276 --> 06:05.582
How did you find me?

06:05.582 --> 06:06.801
You're chipped, remember?

06:06.801 --> 06:08.411
Now, come on.
Let's go home.

06:08.411 --> 06:10.108
I got to stick your
flea medication up your butt.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.110
You dare show your face here
after keeping him prisoner

06:12.110 --> 06:13.721
- in your evil witch lair?
- Whoa.

06:13.721 --> 06:16.288
Okay, first of all,
not loving the witch language.

06:16.288 --> 06:18.378
It's feeling very gendered
to me.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.031
And Scraps isn't my prisoner, okay?

06:20.031 --> 06:21.946
He's my pet.
And he likes it.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.208
Tell 'em, boy.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.559
What is she talking about, dear?

06:25.559 --> 06:28.997
I--

06:28.997 --> 06:30.825
I have no idea.

06:30.825 --> 06:33.175
Must be another one
of her witch lies!

06:34.611 --> 06:36.700
And my name is not Scraps.

06:36.700 --> 06:37.962
It's Goland.

06:37.962 --> 06:39.790
- Roland.
- Roland.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.401
Seize her!

06:42.706 --> 06:45.492
Whoa. Okay.

06:45.492 --> 06:46.971
Ow!

06:46.971 --> 06:49.409
Dick.

06:50.975 --> 06:52.890
Hey, how you doin'?

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
Hey, you like the new ride?

06:54.457 --> 06:57.025
Yeah, it's the new Bifi.
No big deal.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.461
Hello, Boomtown.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.681
My car is a human man now.

07:00.681 --> 07:04.293
Ha ha!

07:04.293 --> 07:07.035
Hey, babes.
Enjoying the view?

07:10.865 --> 07:12.432
Oh, check out that guy.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.085
I bet he has a lot of sex.

07:15.739 --> 07:17.915
Whoa, wait!
Sid?

07:17.915 --> 07:19.308
Hey, fellas.

07:19.308 --> 07:21.832
Like the new ride?

07:21.832 --> 07:23.878
Yeah, I sprung
for the black on black.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.315
And-- check this out--
voice-activated.

07:26.315 --> 07:28.535
Bifi, self-park.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.798
Self-parking activated.

07:38.109 --> 07:41.112
Wow!
Sid, I am impressed.

07:41.112 --> 07:42.549
I didn't know
you had it in you.

07:42.549 --> 07:45.290
Never heard of a bus
that drove a car.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.945
Remember, boss?
He's a bus?

07:47.945 --> 07:49.338
Shut up, Devon.

07:49.338 --> 07:52.776
Clearly, Sid is better
than you now.

07:52.776 --> 07:55.344
Come on, Sid.
Lunch is on me.

07:55.344 --> 07:56.650
Devon, why don't you go
kill yourself

07:56.650 --> 07:58.173
or eat crap or whatever.

08:10.794 --> 08:13.797
Your breakfast,
my handsome man.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.320
Ice cream again?

08:15.320 --> 08:17.671
Belinda,
you know me so well.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.237
Last night was amazing.

08:19.237 --> 08:21.805
My leg is still sore from all
the hours you humped it.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.981
Rawr!

08:23.981 --> 08:25.330
What's the matter,
Miss Muffet?

08:25.330 --> 08:27.028
You're not eating
your kibble.

08:27.028 --> 08:28.595
Ha ha.
I get it.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.640
You're treating me
like your subservient pet

08:30.640 --> 08:33.817
so I know what it feels like
to be in your shoes.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.428
Oh, man,
I didn't even think about that.

08:36.428 --> 08:39.519
But yeah,
it makes it so much better.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.390
Okay.
Well, you had your fun.

08:41.390 --> 08:43.218
Now unlock my chains so I can
burn this place to the ground

08:43.218 --> 08:45.481
and we can go home.
Mm!

08:45.481 --> 08:47.004
This is my home.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.266
People here treat me
with the dignity

08:48.266 --> 08:50.617
and respect
that I so fully deserve.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.315
Sorry.
Ice-cream farts.

08:53.315 --> 08:55.447
Dude!
Right in my face.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.362
Well, I'm all done
with breakfast.

08:57.362 --> 08:58.842
Time to nap until lunch.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.149
Oh, dear, they're expecting you
in the fields.

09:01.149 --> 09:02.933
Oh, man, I have to work now?

09:02.933 --> 09:04.631
But I was just gonna sit on
my ass and do nothing all day.

09:04.631 --> 09:06.502
That's kind of my thing.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.679
Oh, there's
that dry wit again.

09:09.679 --> 09:11.594
You wouldn't be the most
respected man in the village

09:11.594 --> 09:13.378
if you weren't also
the hardest-working.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.163
Y--Godfrey: Come, Father.

09:15.163 --> 09:17.295
Let us till the soil
till our fingers bleed.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.254
- Huzzah!
- Why don't you shut
your shitty mouth,

09:19.254 --> 09:21.038
you little brown-noser?!

09:21.038 --> 09:23.954
I mean, um...

09:23.954 --> 09:26.043
I love you, Son.

09:26.043 --> 09:28.306
Let's go and do it--
work.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.660
Come on.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.183
Mmm!

09:35.183 --> 09:38.012
Weird texture, but not bad.

09:38.012 --> 09:41.189
I cannot tell you how much
this Bifi has changed my life.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.931
Yeah, the old Sid was such
an insecure loser, you know?

09:43.931 --> 09:45.236
Probably 'cause he never knew
his parents

09:45.236 --> 09:47.978
and grew up alone
and afraid.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.504
Ha!

09:52.504 --> 09:54.332
Hey, so, Freya told me that

09:54.332 --> 09:57.901
Scraps got kidnapped,
and she left to go rescue him.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.208
Oh, hey, did you hear they're
bringing out the new Bifi XL?

10:00.208 --> 10:02.863
It's just two Bifis
holding hands.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.778
Cool!

10:04.778 --> 10:08.303
Hey, Sid, it seems like you're
talking about your Bifi a lot.

10:08.303 --> 10:10.131
I-It's cool that
you're so into it,

10:10.131 --> 10:13.308
but you're starting to sound
a little bit like a Bifi Bro.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.876
- Oh, thank you so much.
- No, that's not a good thing.

10:15.876 --> 10:18.269
A Bifi Bro is someone
who makes owning a Bifi

10:18.269 --> 10:20.358
into their entire personality.

10:20.358 --> 10:22.926
It's one of the worst kinds
of douchebags there is,

10:22.926 --> 10:26.103
right up there with Crypto Dork
and Paleo Schmuck.

10:26.103 --> 10:27.583
Oh, Tai.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.672
You know, I never took you
for the jealous type.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.152
Now, if you'll excuse me,

10:31.152 --> 10:33.720
I have to attend a meeting
of my fellow Bifi owners.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.330
We're gonna take pictures
with our Bifis

10:35.330 --> 10:37.898
and discuss why no one else
will talk to us.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.464
Let's go, Bifi.

10:42.337 --> 10:43.599
Huh?

10:43.599 --> 10:44.861
What? Tai?

10:44.861 --> 10:46.341
What-- what are you doing?

10:46.341 --> 10:48.125
I'm sorry.
I can't be responsible

10:48.125 --> 10:50.562
for letting another Bifi Bro
out into the universe.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.826
The world is bad enough
as is.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.393
Are you kidding me?!
Get your hands off my Bifi!

10:55.393 --> 10:58.353
Never!
I ought to go loco
on you, man!

10:58.353 --> 10:59.746
Loco Mode engaged.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.530
What?

11:01.530 --> 11:03.097
Sid!

11:03.097 --> 11:06.100
Sid!

11:06.100 --> 11:10.670
Family, we are back from
an excellent day of hard labor.

11:10.670 --> 11:14.021
Isn't that right, Father?

11:14.021 --> 11:21.115
I wanna die, but I'm too tired
to kill myself.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.420
Oh!

11:22.420 --> 11:25.728
Oh, at least
I can finally relax.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.861
Oh, not just yet, you can't.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.689
You still have to help
Agatha with her homework.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.429
After that, you can
clean the dishes

11:31.429 --> 11:34.563
and put the little ones
to bed.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.217
Hey, we're back
from my walk.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.740
You didn't tell me
how liberating it is

11:37.740 --> 11:39.220
to piss in public.

11:39.220 --> 11:40.525
I just walked straight up
to a fire hydrant

11:40.525 --> 11:42.310
and was like, "Blamo!"

11:42.310 --> 11:43.746
Do you realize
that being a man

11:43.746 --> 11:45.879
comes with all
these responsibilities?

11:45.879 --> 11:48.142
It's like the only reason
people respect me is because

11:48.142 --> 11:49.970
I'm a loving husband,
an active father,

11:49.970 --> 11:52.494
and contribute to
the community at large.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.843
Ugh.

11:53.843 --> 11:59.501
Hey, I know it's a lot,
but you can do it.

11:59.501 --> 12:04.811
You know, I hate to admit this,
but you make a pretty great man.

12:04.811 --> 12:05.899
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:05.899 --> 12:07.770
Oh, thanks, Freya.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.119
You know, that's really
big of you,

12:09.119 --> 12:10.904
given how I've been
treating you lately.

12:10.904 --> 12:12.732
Oh, you know me.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.037
I don't hold grudges.

12:14.037 --> 12:15.952
Just water under the bridge,
my friend.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.476
Que sera, sera.

12:18.476 --> 12:21.044
Alright, well, I guess
I should start helping

12:21.044 --> 12:22.829
Agatha with her homework.

12:27.137 --> 12:31.838
And I can start burning this
mother effer to the ground.

12:38.845 --> 12:42.283
Sid! You need to get the Bifi
under control!

12:42.283 --> 12:44.807
Check the owner's manual!

12:44.807 --> 12:46.417
Okay.
Loco Mode, Loco Mode.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.854
"How to turn off Loco Mode."

12:47.854 --> 12:50.378
"There is no way
to turn off Loco Mode."

12:50.378 --> 12:52.249
Aah!
I'm gonna die!

12:53.990 --> 12:56.166
Looking good, ladies.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.952
Help me!

12:58.952 --> 13:02.303
Get out of the way!

13:02.303 --> 13:03.783
Don't worry,
he's in the junkyard now.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.741
Not much damage
he could do there.

13:08.004 --> 13:09.876
Oh, no!
Not the fine china!

13:13.270 --> 13:16.839
Okay, so, say a man toils
in the field for nine hours,

13:16.839 --> 13:18.798
and then add three hours
of chores around the house

13:18.798 --> 13:20.495
and then two hours
of family time.

13:20.495 --> 13:24.455
So much time does that leave
for the man to have for himself?

13:24.455 --> 13:25.805
No time, Agatha!

13:25.805 --> 13:27.241
It leaves no time!

13:27.241 --> 13:28.329
Dear, have you seen
Miss Muffet?

13:28.329 --> 13:29.983
Her chain is unlocked.

13:29.983 --> 13:33.856
Well, that's impossible,
because I got the keys right--

13:33.856 --> 13:35.118
Oh, no.

13:35.118 --> 13:37.294
Calling all ass wipes!

13:37.294 --> 13:39.427
You stole my war dog.

13:39.427 --> 13:42.299
You forced me into
this ridiculous outfit--

13:42.299 --> 13:45.346
which I'm killing,
by the way.

13:45.346 --> 13:49.524
Well, now I'm gonna burn your
stinkin' village to the ground!

13:53.702 --> 13:56.270
Hmm. It's not catching.

13:56.270 --> 13:59.273
Uh, does anyone have newspaper?

13:59.273 --> 14:00.709
Or a piece of cardboard?

14:01.710 --> 14:03.146
Anyone?

14:03.146 --> 14:04.887
Roland, you have to go out there
and stop her.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.368
Are you kidding me?
She's gonna kick my ass.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.978
Couldn't we just have
the girl do it?

14:08.978 --> 14:11.024
It's your responsibility
to protect us.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.721
Are you not a man?

14:12.721 --> 14:15.463
Ugh! Yeah, I'm a--
I'm a man.

14:15.463 --> 14:17.682
Stupid town
always needs saving.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.864
Boy, for a guy
screaming like a maniac,

14:24.864 --> 14:26.430
he still looks pretty cool.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.394
Sid, that tower of junk
is gonna collapse!

14:33.394 --> 14:34.699
You have to jump!

14:34.699 --> 14:36.876
No!
I can't leave the Bifi behind!

14:36.876 --> 14:39.095
Well, if you don't jump,
you'll die!

14:39.095 --> 14:42.403
I'd rather die than go back
to the old Sid!

14:42.403 --> 14:44.057
He makes a pretty
convincing argument.

14:44.057 --> 14:46.189
Maybe he should die.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.539
I'm gonna have to do this
on my own.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.296
Bingo.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.866
Hey!

15:10.866 --> 15:13.216
Eat shirt!

15:13.216 --> 15:15.001
Mommy!
Ooh!

15:15.001 --> 15:16.437
Right in the nards.

15:16.437 --> 15:18.091
You hate to see that.

15:19.614 --> 15:22.225
No! No!
No, no, no!

15:22.225 --> 15:23.835
Let me go! No!

15:23.835 --> 15:25.707
Don't take me away
from the Bifi!

15:25.707 --> 15:26.969
No! No!

15:26.969 --> 15:28.231
No! Bifi!

15:28.231 --> 15:32.018
Uh-oh.
Bifi!

15:36.936 --> 15:38.459
Still burning
your village down.

15:38.459 --> 15:41.853
It's just taking a sec.
Thanks for your patience.

15:41.853 --> 15:45.161
Not if I have anything
to say about it.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.947
Are you serious?
What? You're gonna fight me now?

15:47.947 --> 15:49.687
That's right.

15:49.687 --> 15:51.689
I want to sacrifice my life
for my wife and children.

15:51.689 --> 15:53.430
It's, like,
my favorite thing to do.

15:53.430 --> 15:54.692
I can't believe this.

15:54.692 --> 15:56.303
After everything
I've done for you.

15:56.303 --> 15:59.306
I got you toys to chew on,
a dirty blanket to sleep on.

15:59.306 --> 16:01.656
I expressed your anal glands
when you were constipated.

16:01.656 --> 16:05.312
Yeah, but you never
gave me respect!

16:05.312 --> 16:07.923
You know, a man shouldn't have
to walk around

16:07.923 --> 16:11.187
in ridiculous outfits or--
or eat leftovers off the floor.

16:11.187 --> 16:15.104
No, a-a man does chores
and he works

16:15.104 --> 16:17.933
and he has trouble
sleeping at night

16:17.933 --> 16:19.717
because he made a dentist
appointment too early

16:19.717 --> 16:23.634
in the morning and is worried
about getting enough sleep!

16:23.634 --> 16:25.375
Wow.

16:25.375 --> 16:29.292
Scraps, I didn't realize you
were so unhappy being my pet.

16:29.292 --> 16:30.685
If this is really
what you want,

16:30.685 --> 16:34.080
then I guess
I'll just leave you alone.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.957
He did it!
He defeated the witch!

16:47.354 --> 16:50.661
Freya, wait!

16:50.661 --> 16:53.186
What's he doing?

16:53.186 --> 16:55.144
I take it all back, alright?

16:55.144 --> 16:58.843
I don't want any of this work
or responsibility.

16:58.843 --> 17:02.978
And, honestly,
the kids-- eh.

17:02.978 --> 17:05.198
I just want to be
your war dog again.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.764
But what about all that stuff
you were saying

17:06.764 --> 17:08.766
about wanting dignity
and respect?

17:08.766 --> 17:10.377
I don't need it.
It's overrated.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.162
I just want to nap at your feet
and lick my ass all day.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.556
You know what you have
to do then.

17:15.556 --> 17:18.907
Oh, geez, Mom.
In front of them?

17:18.907 --> 17:22.302
Sit.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.868
Shake.

17:25.914 --> 17:27.481
Look at me.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.265
Who's my good boy?

17:29.265 --> 17:31.485
You're my good boy!

17:31.485 --> 17:34.575
- I guess he really is a dog.
That tickles.

17:34.575 --> 17:35.837
Papa?

17:39.362 --> 17:40.929
Let's back him up.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.539
Owie.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.282
I guess that's it
for the new Sid.

17:46.282 --> 17:47.762
Hey, maybe it's for the best.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.546
Sure, the old Sid was a dork,

17:49.546 --> 17:52.245
but at least he wasn't
an obnoxious douchebag.

17:52.245 --> 17:56.075
The truth is, you never needed
the Bifi to be confident.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.380
You dirt turkey!

17:57.380 --> 17:59.165
Look what you did
to my junkyard, Sid.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.340
This is coming out of your pay,
you hear me?

18:00.340 --> 18:01.732
Look, the junkyard is fine!

18:01.732 --> 18:03.343
The only problem here
is you not treating

18:03.343 --> 18:05.606
your number-one employee
with a bit of goddamn respect!

18:05.606 --> 18:08.087
So will you get off
my ass?!

18:08.087 --> 18:10.263
Wow. Fair enough.

18:10.263 --> 18:12.265
Hopping off that ass now.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.658
Go-- go clean up that mess.

18:14.658 --> 18:16.834
My apologies.

18:16.834 --> 18:20.708
Wow.
Tai, it worked.

18:20.708 --> 18:25.974
Tai?

18:25.974 --> 18:30.587
<i>We may have won the battle,
but the war rages on.</i>

18:30.587 --> 18:33.286
<i>As long as there are douchebags
who are too obsessed</i>

18:33.286 --> 18:37.986
<i>with their expensive cars,
I'll be there--</i>

18:37.986 --> 18:41.424
<i>to shoot them in the nards
with a T-shirt cannon.</i>

18:41.424 --> 18:45.167
<i>For I am the Nardinator.</i>

18:52.957 --> 18:54.176
And then I was like,
"Am I drinking my pee?"

18:55.438 --> 18:56.918
Hey!
You found Scraps.

18:56.918 --> 18:59.138
Yeah. We had a fun time
together, didn't we, boy?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.487
Oh, yeah, it was great.

19:00.487 --> 19:02.489
Well, my long-lost family
kidnapped me,

19:02.489 --> 19:04.055
and then they kidnapped Freya,

19:04.055 --> 19:05.274
and then we burned
the village to the ground,

19:05.274 --> 19:07.015
and then we got ice creams.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.451
Wait.
What was the last part?

19:08.451 --> 19:10.845
We got ice creams.
These are rocky road.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.151
No, no, before that.
You-- Wait.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.805
You burned the village
to the ground?

19:14.805 --> 19:16.198
Why?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.591
They were just
being annoying.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.070
- Why didn't you stop her?
- I don't know.

19:19.070 --> 19:20.507
'Cause I'm not
the friggin' police.

19:20.507 --> 19:22.248
This guy.
"I'm the police."

19:22.248 --> 19:24.380
Alright, but at least
y-your family survived, right?

19:24.380 --> 19:26.513
Uh-huh. Yeah. We burned
the whole village to the ground,

19:26.513 --> 19:28.732
and my family
miraculously survived.

19:28.732 --> 19:30.256
You married this chaunce?

19:30.256 --> 19:31.735
Hey, don't look at me.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.347
No, no, no.
But, seriously, are they okay?

19:34.347 --> 19:36.305
Because if not, that is
the darkest thing

19:36.305 --> 19:38.916
you have ever done.

19:38.916 --> 19:41.702
Awkward!

19:41.702 --> 19:43.573
Oyy!
Guys.

19:43.573 --> 19:47.664
- It's stuffy in there.
- Guys, are they dead?

19:47.664 --> 19:48.709
Guys!
