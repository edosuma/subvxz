00:00.898 --> 00:02.033
<i>From the start,</i>

00:02.082 --> 00:04.050
<i>this story has been
about a town,</i>

00:05.558 --> 00:07.386
<i>and the people
who lived in that town,</i>

00:07.990 --> 00:10.802
<i>and the darkness that lived
in some of those people.</i>

00:11.383 --> 00:12.622
<i>Clifford Blossom.</i>

00:13.882 --> 00:16.555
<i>The Black Hood,
the Gargoyle King,</i>

00:16.999 --> 00:18.292
<i>the Stonies.</i>

00:20.020 --> 00:22.883
<i>Add to their ranks,
my sister, Jellybean,</i>

00:22.968 --> 00:24.994
<i>who had been
the Voyeur/Auteur,</i>

00:25.079 --> 00:26.526
<i>making the videotapes
that have been</i>

00:26.611 --> 00:28.803
<i>disturbing our town for months.</i>

00:32.436 --> 00:34.229
This isn't your fault, Jug.

00:35.688 --> 00:37.346
It just feels like it.

00:37.734 --> 00:40.069
I was the one that
convinced her to move out here

00:40.569 --> 00:42.070
away from everything
she ever knew.

00:42.154 --> 00:43.542
And then I ignored her.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.782
You were in the fight
of your life

00:45.866 --> 00:47.388
at Stonewall Prep.

00:49.453 --> 00:50.955
JB is tough.

00:51.929 --> 00:53.680
She'll get through this.

00:57.623 --> 01:00.440
Hey,
how is she?

01:01.506 --> 01:02.799
I don't know.

01:02.883 --> 01:04.153
I really don't know.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.999
I don't know if you're
gonna like this idea, FP,

01:06.083 --> 01:07.762
but I've been
looking into child therapists

01:07.846 --> 01:10.640
and I found one
that has excellent references.

01:10.724 --> 01:12.142
Well, I hope they're in Ohio,

01:12.226 --> 01:14.211
because that's where
I'm taking Jellybean.

01:14.707 --> 01:15.916
Back to Toledo.

01:16.001 --> 01:17.419
Maybe you're right.

01:17.606 --> 01:18.921
She might need her mother.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.991
And her father.

01:22.527 --> 01:23.929
What does that mean?

01:24.863 --> 01:26.181
Alice...

01:28.242 --> 01:30.535
she's my little girl.

01:30.619 --> 01:32.412
And if this
isn't a cry for help,

01:32.496 --> 01:34.347
I don't know what is.

01:34.799 --> 01:36.791
Can we at least have
a conversation about this?

01:36.875 --> 01:39.318
Yeah. Yeah, we will.

01:40.462 --> 01:42.607
But first things first.

01:42.832 --> 01:44.253
Jellybean finally told me

01:44.338 --> 01:46.450
where her accomplices
were hiding out most nights.

01:50.514 --> 01:52.764
Jug, Mr. Jones,
what's going on?

01:52.849 --> 01:54.197
We need you
to open up your gym.

01:54.282 --> 01:55.600
What, right now?

01:56.186 --> 01:57.963
After we make
a couple of stops.

02:02.234 --> 02:03.484
Gentlemen,

02:03.568 --> 02:05.653
to what do I owe
this late-night call?

02:05.737 --> 02:08.072
You need to reinstate
Tom Keller as Sheriff, Hiram.

02:08.156 --> 02:09.558
Right the hell now.

02:35.726 --> 02:37.919
Asleep, they almost
looked innocent.

02:38.560 --> 02:40.224
It's just messed up.

02:41.398 --> 02:43.316
We survived the death
of Jason Blossom,

02:43.400 --> 02:45.235
and the Black Hood,
and the Gargoyle King,

02:45.319 --> 02:47.320
but I didn't even consider

02:47.404 --> 02:49.630
how the fallout of all that
would affect the generation

02:49.715 --> 02:52.826
coming up behind us,
including Jellybean.

02:54.033 --> 02:57.221
Unless a meteorite
strikes this town in two days,

02:57.465 --> 02:59.367
we'll have survived graduation,

02:59.452 --> 03:00.936
but will they?

03:02.419 --> 03:06.035
And are we just doomed
to be haunted by this town

03:06.120 --> 03:08.105
for the rest of our lives?

03:10.280 --> 03:13.637
Dad? Dad, what gives?
Take the picture.

03:13.722 --> 03:15.807
The ceremony starts
in the gym in 10 minutes.

03:15.891 --> 03:17.475
Yeah, Dad,
what's taking so long?

03:17.559 --> 03:20.720
I... I can't believe
we're here.

03:20.896 --> 03:24.047
Archie, you're graduating.

03:24.620 --> 03:26.509
Didn't think I'd live
to see this day.

03:33.209 --> 03:34.763

03:41.963 --> 03:43.714
Mom, it's not even
graduation yet.

03:43.798 --> 03:45.793
No, but it is your
last day of high school.

03:45.878 --> 03:47.342
We don't know that yet.

03:47.426 --> 03:50.095
I do. I have
a really good feeling.

03:50.179 --> 03:52.269
You've been applying yourself
so much lately.

03:52.354 --> 03:54.183
Yeah, we'll see.
Love you, Mom.

03:54.267 --> 03:55.584
Love you.

04:07.543 --> 04:10.335
As honorary chairperson
and de facto queen

04:10.420 --> 04:12.977
of tonight's semi-formal...
This one's for you, JJ.

04:27.438 --> 04:29.797
Pour moi?

04:36.234 --> 04:38.393
I know it's been a while since
you've worn any pearls for me,

04:38.477 --> 04:39.612
so maybe
you'll

04:39.697 --> 04:41.589
wear them for the
last day of school.

04:53.232 --> 04:55.426
Is it true what they say
about your dad?

04:57.246 --> 04:59.440
That he's
the devil incarnate?

05:00.249 --> 05:01.689
I stand by my father.

05:14.982 --> 05:17.753
Please stop crying.

05:18.445 --> 05:20.894
You know, I was already
picturing Thanksgiving break

05:20.978 --> 05:24.106
and you were gonna come home
on the train from Yale

05:24.190 --> 05:26.217
and everyone would be here.

05:27.652 --> 05:30.737
FP, Jughead, Jellybean,

05:30.821 --> 05:33.641
you, Charles, Polly,
and the twins.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.940
Yeah, that would have
been nice.

05:37.578 --> 05:40.539
Now it's just
gonna be me, alone.

05:40.623 --> 05:43.083
Hey, even if it's
just you and me

05:43.167 --> 05:45.544
having turkey meatloaf
at Pop's,

05:45.628 --> 05:48.651
I will be here
for Thanksgiving, okay?

05:49.492 --> 05:53.259
And Christmas.
And whenever you need me.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.657
I love you so much, Elizabeth.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.084
I love you too, Mom.

06:07.704 --> 06:10.776
Seventy-five years ago, the
first senior class of Riverdale High

06:10.861 --> 06:13.533
buried a time capsule
just before they graduated.

06:13.941 --> 06:16.793
And now, as our seniors prepare
for their own graduation,

06:16.878 --> 06:18.016
it's time to open it.

06:18.101 --> 06:19.119
Ladies.

06:25.376 --> 06:26.960
A copy of
The Riverdale Register

06:27.044 --> 06:30.505
from June 12, 1945.

06:30.589 --> 06:34.743
The Blue and Gold
also from that same year.

06:36.804 --> 06:38.513
This one's for Jughead.

06:38.597 --> 06:42.643
A Pop's menu from when
hamburgers only cost 15 cents.

06:42.727 --> 06:46.438
Baseball card of
Ambrose "The Rocket" Pipps,

06:46.522 --> 06:49.066
Riverdale's hometown hero.

06:49.150 --> 06:52.678
Comic book.

06:54.488 --> 06:56.057
And lastly,

06:56.142 --> 06:59.701
a photo of four seniors

06:59.785 --> 07:01.578
and it's written here
that this was taken

07:01.662 --> 07:04.531
days before the boys
headed off to war.

07:04.790 --> 07:06.959
All of these items will be
on display in the hallway

07:07.043 --> 07:09.236
for closer inspection
during graduation week.

07:09.754 --> 07:11.505
And, fellow seniors,

07:11.589 --> 07:13.866
enjoy your last day
of high school.

07:16.635 --> 07:19.054
Guys, doesn't this
feel so weird?

07:19.138 --> 07:20.847
Like this is the last time
we'll all be hanging out

07:20.931 --> 07:22.177
- in the lounge together.
- Hmm.

07:22.262 --> 07:23.179
Except for reunions?

07:23.264 --> 07:24.962
Yeah, and Homecoming, Kev.

07:25.269 --> 07:26.812
It just won't be the same.

07:26.896 --> 07:28.563
What exactly
are we waiting for again?

07:28.647 --> 07:30.407
Hot off the presses, chums.

07:30.492 --> 07:31.775
Oh, year books.

07:31.859 --> 07:33.110
But Honey banned those,
didn't he?

07:33.194 --> 07:35.445
Yes, but Mr. Honey is gone.

07:35.529 --> 07:37.739
Brava, well done, ladies.

07:37.823 --> 07:39.321
This is amazing.

07:39.406 --> 07:41.743
There's even an entire page
dedicated to The Serpents.

07:41.827 --> 07:44.037
And a shout out
to the Pretty Poisons.

07:44.121 --> 07:45.455
And the musicals.

07:45.539 --> 07:48.208
Despite the fact that...

07:48.292 --> 07:49.673
Archie Andrews
and Jughead Jones

07:49.758 --> 07:51.133
to the principal's office.

07:51.218 --> 07:53.573
Archie Andrews
and Jughead Jones

07:53.768 --> 07:55.435
to the principal's office.

07:56.146 --> 07:57.798
Dead teens walking.

08:02.014 --> 08:03.432
Guess who's graduating?

08:03.516 --> 08:05.434
Holy crap, you're a legend.

08:05.518 --> 08:07.477
- Phew!
- What about summer school?

08:07.561 --> 08:10.272
No more pencils, no more books,
no more teachers' dirty looks.

08:10.356 --> 08:11.898
I'm happy for you, Jug.

08:11.982 --> 08:14.802
Archie, he's ready for you.

08:16.529 --> 08:17.846
It's gonna be all right.

08:18.572 --> 08:20.140
- All right?
- Yeah.

08:27.873 --> 08:31.043
I get no pleasure in
telling you this, Mr. Andrews,

08:31.127 --> 08:32.669
but despite your efforts,

08:33.014 --> 08:35.667
you will not be graduating
with your classmates.

08:37.842 --> 08:39.775
So it's summer school
for me, then?

08:40.344 --> 08:43.038
Unfortunately, that's
not going to be enough.

08:44.515 --> 08:46.310
You'll have to
repeat your senior year.

08:49.390 --> 08:51.601
I understand this is a shock,

08:52.231 --> 08:55.424
but no one is going to hold
this year against you, Archie.

08:56.705 --> 08:58.816
I appreciate
you saying that, sir.

09:02.741 --> 09:05.501
Uh,
can I still...

09:05.586 --> 09:07.229
Walk with your classmates?

09:08.701 --> 09:10.122
Of course you can.

09:11.959 --> 09:13.527
In fact,

09:14.086 --> 09:15.732
though it's last minute,

09:16.201 --> 09:19.608
I was hoping you might record
the graduation song for us.

09:21.135 --> 09:23.078
Yeah, I'd be happy to, sir.

09:25.681 --> 09:28.183
What's the verdict?
Summer school, yay or nay?

09:28.267 --> 09:30.143
Summer school as expected.

09:30.227 --> 09:31.436
But Weatherbee's letting me

09:31.520 --> 09:33.397
walk at graduation
with you guys.

09:33.481 --> 09:35.273
And I'll have my diploma
by the end of June.

09:35.357 --> 09:36.858
That's a relief.

09:36.942 --> 09:38.777
Now you can enjoy
the last day of school with us.

09:38.861 --> 09:40.304
Yeah, definitely.

10:47.846 --> 10:49.331
Working on your speech?

10:49.784 --> 10:51.077
Mmm-hmm.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.342
Well, don't keep me
in suspense.

10:53.723 --> 10:54.998
What's it about?

10:56.230 --> 10:58.190
Well, considering
I haven't written any of it,

10:58.274 --> 10:59.983
I guess you'll just
have to wait and see.

11:00.067 --> 11:01.612
Oh, I'm sure you'll crack it.

11:01.697 --> 11:03.015
You always do.

11:12.538 --> 11:16.191
Ronnie, what's going on?

11:17.242 --> 11:18.980
I was cleaning out
my room

11:19.195 --> 11:21.630
and I came across
some choice items

11:21.714 --> 11:24.478
that you've left
over the past three years,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.869
and I wanted to
give it back to you.

11:27.845 --> 11:29.120
Oh.

11:31.432 --> 11:36.003
Also, despite everything
that's happened between us,

11:38.105 --> 11:40.215
I wanted to be
with you tonight...

11:41.859 --> 11:44.219
if only for one last time.

11:45.779 --> 11:47.054
Is that crazy?

11:47.823 --> 11:50.867
No, not at all.

11:51.021 --> 11:54.424
In fact, I can't think of anything
I want more in this moment.

12:15.278 --> 12:16.971
At school yesterday,

12:18.990 --> 12:20.859
I spied you
looking at that picture

12:20.944 --> 12:22.637
from the time capsule.

12:25.396 --> 12:26.714
What gives?

12:30.377 --> 12:32.273
I was just wondering what...

12:33.120 --> 12:35.272
what must have been
going through their minds.

12:38.260 --> 12:40.178
Most of their classmates
were heading to college

12:40.262 --> 12:42.288
or into their
family businesses.

12:43.723 --> 12:46.009
These guys were going off
to fight a war.

12:51.690 --> 12:54.541
You're not getting
any crazy ideas, are you?

12:55.318 --> 12:58.096
Not unless you consider
summer school crazy.

13:07.831 --> 13:11.276
Hey, I was thinking, uh,
after graduation, I'd...

13:12.377 --> 13:13.836
go to Toledo
with you and Jellybean.

13:13.920 --> 13:14.879
No. Uh-uh.

13:14.963 --> 13:16.339
Well, you said it yourself,

13:16.423 --> 13:18.132
family is what's
most important right now.

13:18.216 --> 13:20.802
You're the first Jones man
to get into college.

13:20.886 --> 13:22.637
You're going to college.

13:22.721 --> 13:25.457
And you're old enough to be
on your own. You understand,

13:26.433 --> 13:27.708
right, boy?

13:33.940 --> 13:35.191
And this,

13:35.275 --> 13:36.609
Nana, has been my locker

13:36.693 --> 13:38.528
since the end
of sophomore year.

13:38.612 --> 13:40.029
Hmm. It's a lot nicer

13:40.113 --> 13:42.407
than the one you had
at Southside High.

13:42.491 --> 13:44.534
But all your things are
still in it, Antoinette.

13:44.618 --> 13:46.285
I know.

13:46.369 --> 13:48.704
I'll clean it out
over the weekend.

13:48.788 --> 13:51.775
A lot of special memories
with a lot of special people.

13:55.128 --> 13:56.946
Including my girlfriend.

13:59.591 --> 14:01.843
We're so incredibly
proud of you, Toni.

14:01.927 --> 14:03.441
The whole family is.

14:03.803 --> 14:05.663
You've honored the Topaz name.

14:36.878 --> 14:39.197
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay, Mom.

14:40.674 --> 14:42.242
I'm just missing Dad.

14:44.261 --> 14:45.662
I wish he was here.

14:46.388 --> 14:48.122
Here's here, honey.

14:48.515 --> 14:49.833
He's here.

14:52.894 --> 14:54.395
Ladies and gentlemen,

14:54.479 --> 14:57.109
it imbues me
with such pride and joy,

14:57.308 --> 14:58.566
to invite to the stage

14:58.650 --> 15:01.288
the senior class's
valedictorian,

15:01.475 --> 15:03.288
Miss Elizabeth Cooper.

15:11.955 --> 15:13.032
Hi.

15:13.402 --> 15:15.999
I admit I've been struggling

15:16.084 --> 15:18.686
with what I wanted
to say today.

15:20.797 --> 15:26.129
High school is supposed to be
this amazing, safe time.

15:27.846 --> 15:33.256
But our years were co-opted
with heartache and drama...

15:34.894 --> 15:36.796
and even death.

15:37.709 --> 15:38.922
And it's not fair

15:39.007 --> 15:41.165
that so many of our classmates
aren't here

15:41.250 --> 15:42.776
to walk with us today.

15:44.237 --> 15:46.197
And it's not right
that some of our parents

15:46.281 --> 15:49.601
aren't here to watch
those of us who are.

15:53.997 --> 15:56.579
Those younger than us
have known no Riverdale

15:56.664 --> 15:58.982
other than the one
steeped in violence.

15:59.169 --> 16:01.306
Our class is lucky enough
to remember a time

16:01.391 --> 16:04.021
before the era of tragedy,

16:04.879 --> 16:07.690
when this was just a small,

16:08.690 --> 16:12.339
sleepy, slightly boring town.

16:12.682 --> 16:15.226
That's the Riverdale
I wish upon the generation

16:15.310 --> 16:16.936
coming up behind us

16:17.020 --> 16:18.426
and the one I want us,

16:18.511 --> 16:21.456
our class to remember
as we head into the future.

16:22.207 --> 16:24.275
So, please,

16:25.987 --> 16:27.555
stay young

16:28.302 --> 16:30.329
for as long as you can.

16:31.660 --> 16:34.062
Stay innocent
for as long as possible,

16:36.831 --> 16:39.275
even if it's only
for one more moment.

16:41.609 --> 16:42.884
Thank you.

Cheryl, Cheryl!

19:35.160 --> 19:36.478
Mother?

19:37.562 --> 19:38.755
What's going on?

19:38.945 --> 19:41.749
Well, I wasn't about to miss
my only child's graduation,

19:41.834 --> 19:44.294
so I snuck in the back
at the last minute.

19:44.378 --> 19:45.962
Also, I wanted to tell you

19:46.046 --> 19:48.298
about a decision
that I've made.

19:48.382 --> 19:50.342
With you being
a grown woman now,

19:50.426 --> 19:53.178
I'm going to turn myself
over to the authorities

19:53.262 --> 19:56.139
to pay for, well, some
of the crimes I've committed.

19:56.223 --> 19:58.767
What? But, Mumzie,

19:58.851 --> 20:00.435
you're a hothouse flower.

20:00.519 --> 20:02.145
I've spoken to Hiram Lodge.

20:02.229 --> 20:03.939
He's promised to take
proper care of me

20:04.023 --> 20:05.523
in his private jail.

20:05.607 --> 20:07.525
And with good behavior,

20:07.609 --> 20:09.069
I may even be out in time

20:09.153 --> 20:11.196
to see you graduate
from Highsmith College.

20:11.280 --> 20:13.640
Mumzie, if that's
even happening.

20:14.700 --> 20:16.692
Nightmare child,
what do you mean?

20:17.980 --> 20:20.564
Got to hit the road if we
want to make it by sundown.

20:21.133 --> 20:22.133
Dad.

20:27.587 --> 20:30.339
Boy, I know you would have
given up Iowa for Jellybean

20:30.424 --> 20:33.076
and I promise you she's gonna
know it too, but...

20:34.803 --> 20:36.538
you going to college,

20:37.473 --> 20:39.124
being a success,

20:39.850 --> 20:41.710
that's good for us Joneses.

20:47.030 --> 20:48.177
I love you.

20:49.919 --> 20:51.553
I love you too, Jug.

21:02.456 --> 21:04.066
So is this it?

21:05.626 --> 21:07.402
The end of our story?

21:09.088 --> 21:10.614
God, I hope not.

21:12.508 --> 21:14.159
But, you know, for now...

21:14.551 --> 21:16.761
I know.

21:16.845 --> 21:20.842
I know what you have to do.
And I love you for it.

22:19.491 --> 22:21.034
It's not too late, is it?

22:21.118 --> 22:22.702
No, it's not too late.

22:22.786 --> 22:24.496
And we're happy
to discuss options with you,

22:24.580 --> 22:27.082
but this isn't a decision
to be taken lightly.

22:27.166 --> 22:30.193
I understand. I'd love to hear
what you have to say.

22:40.137 --> 22:41.429
Hey, Pop,

22:41.513 --> 22:43.264
can I grab a clean menu?

22:43.348 --> 22:45.500
It's for something
Betty has planned.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.294
I've been doing this
a long time.

22:49.646 --> 22:52.607
It's never easy watching
you kids head off to college.

22:52.691 --> 22:55.139
Which reminds me, Pop,

22:55.444 --> 22:56.981
the paperwork's
coming your way,

22:57.066 --> 22:58.551
but the gist of it is

22:59.448 --> 23:00.990
I'm signing over
full ownership

23:01.074 --> 23:03.522
of Pop's Chock'lit Shoppe Diner
to you.

23:04.786 --> 23:06.146
Veronica,

23:06.882 --> 23:08.585
I don't know what to say...

23:08.765 --> 23:11.776
except
thank you.

23:14.004 --> 23:15.797
You know, it's funny,

23:15.881 --> 23:17.908
when I first came to Riverdale,

23:19.218 --> 23:23.705
I never imagined
I would call it home, ever.

23:25.557 --> 23:27.292
And then I came here...

23:28.060 --> 23:29.377
to Pop's

23:30.646 --> 23:32.839
and that's exactly
what it felt like.

23:36.026 --> 23:37.344
Home.

23:39.404 --> 23:41.084
Did everyone bring an item?

23:42.658 --> 23:45.034
I am putting in today's copy

23:45.118 --> 23:47.829
The Riverdale Register
The Blue and Gold,

23:47.913 --> 23:51.280
my last edition
as editor-in-chief.

23:52.167 --> 23:55.336
And a bobby pin
in case anyone needs it.

23:55.499 --> 23:58.657
I'm putting in a football
signed by all of the Bulldogs.

23:59.233 --> 24:00.383
Long may they roar.

24:00.467 --> 24:02.719
I'm putting in a Pop's menu

24:02.803 --> 24:04.053
and a La Bonne Nuit matchbook.

24:04.137 --> 24:06.639
I'm putting in
programs for my musicals

24:06.723 --> 24:10.143
as well as a pair
of Josie's cat ears.

24:10.227 --> 24:11.519
I wish she was here with us.

24:11.603 --> 24:13.813
Oh, HBIC shirt,

24:13.897 --> 24:15.982
I found no one
deserving of you.

24:16.066 --> 24:17.901
Therefore, toodles.

24:17.985 --> 24:19.736
The Pretty Poisons were fun,

24:19.820 --> 24:23.156
but, uh, I'm gonna keep
my Serpent jacket

24:23.240 --> 24:25.392
'cause I'll always
be one at heart.

24:26.910 --> 24:29.229
Well, it's getting pretty full
in there, but...

24:36.461 --> 24:37.587
Finally.

24:37.671 --> 24:39.172
Putting in a guitar pick

24:39.256 --> 24:41.908
and a hammer
from my dad's toolbox.

24:56.106 --> 24:58.149
You guys
are the best friends

24:58.233 --> 25:00.298
anyone could ask for.

25:00.736 --> 25:03.238
Uh-oh. Sounds like
another vow is coming on.

25:03.322 --> 25:06.032
So let's make vow. Really.

25:06.116 --> 25:07.680
The four of us right now.

25:07.909 --> 25:09.529
That in one year,

25:09.828 --> 25:11.914
no matter what's going on
in our lives,

25:12.120 --> 25:13.233
we'll meet back at Pop's.

25:13.318 --> 25:14.415
One year from today.

25:14.499 --> 25:17.152
And every year
after that. Deal?

25:17.745 --> 25:19.020
Deal.

25:23.425 --> 25:24.700
Good.

25:25.260 --> 25:26.535
Okay.

25:27.804 --> 25:30.575
There's...
There's something else.

25:30.724 --> 25:32.684
Dramatique
this evening, Archie.

25:36.021 --> 25:37.339
I'm joining the army.

25:40.317 --> 25:41.968
I know it's sudden.

25:43.123 --> 25:44.645
But I enlisted

25:45.364 --> 25:47.385
and I leave for basic training
in the morning.

25:48.950 --> 25:50.471
It's kind of
the same plan I had

25:50.556 --> 25:51.811
going to the Naval Academy.

25:52.162 --> 25:53.464
Hardly.

25:53.549 --> 25:56.259
In fact, it's nothing
like the Naval Academy.

25:56.541 --> 25:58.001
I can get
my high school degree

25:58.085 --> 25:59.410
without repeating senior year,

25:59.495 --> 26:00.920
which I was gonna have to do.

26:01.004 --> 26:02.572
I'd be set up for college.

26:03.128 --> 26:04.588
Look, guys,

26:04.800 --> 26:07.035
for the first time
in a long time,

26:08.842 --> 26:10.176
I don't feel scared

26:10.347 --> 26:12.415
or uncertain about my future.

26:14.434 --> 26:16.435
Well, if that's what you feel

26:16.520 --> 26:18.855
is the right thing
for you, Arch, then...

26:18.939 --> 26:20.023
Sorry, but no.

26:20.107 --> 26:21.553
I won't sit here
and support this.

26:21.638 --> 26:22.832
Wait, Ronnie.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.235
Wait. Wait, Ronnie.

26:24.319 --> 26:26.529
You do know
there's a war going on, right?

26:26.613 --> 26:27.931
Of course.

26:30.283 --> 26:31.784
You don't have a plan.

26:31.868 --> 26:33.978
And I get that that's scary.
But this...

26:35.247 --> 26:37.482
This is straight-up lunacy,
Archie,

26:38.125 --> 26:39.651
and I won't indulge it.

26:41.294 --> 26:42.612
Ronnie.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.677
Toni, I have something
to tell you,

26:49.761 --> 26:51.861
and it's not going to be easy.

26:52.446 --> 26:54.431
I'm not going
to Highsmith College.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.357
I'm confused.

26:56.560 --> 26:58.686
Because it doesn't
have cheerleading?

26:58.770 --> 27:01.464
That, and...

27:03.275 --> 27:04.650
it just doesn't
feel right anymore.

27:04.734 --> 27:06.652
If you don't go,
I'm not going.

27:06.736 --> 27:09.005
No, you must.

27:09.448 --> 27:11.483
You will thrive there.

27:12.033 --> 27:15.631
But I have to fix things here.

27:15.814 --> 27:18.164
What are you talking about?
What things?

27:18.248 --> 27:22.130
The Blossom family name
conjures a horror show

27:22.394 --> 27:25.438
in this town,
and rightfully so.

27:25.547 --> 27:28.466
But now that I have control of
the maple factory and groves,

27:28.550 --> 27:30.468
I have a chance
to lift up this town

27:30.552 --> 27:32.929
and rehabilitate
our Blossom family legacy.

27:33.013 --> 27:35.350
But I need to be here,

27:36.099 --> 27:37.340
where the damage was done.

27:37.425 --> 27:39.477
If this is about my nana,

27:39.561 --> 27:41.430
you need to get that
out of your mind.

27:41.564 --> 27:43.814
She's starting to come around.

27:43.899 --> 27:45.194
Hell, she even asked me

27:45.279 --> 27:46.978
if we were gonna be living
in the same dorm room

27:47.062 --> 27:49.679
so she could
send us care packages.

27:50.472 --> 27:52.320
That's progress, right?

27:53.116 --> 27:54.434
Toni.

27:57.120 --> 28:00.307
You know I love you
with every ounce of my soul.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.501
But I don't want you
to have to choose

28:03.585 --> 28:07.686
between your family and me.

28:08.423 --> 28:11.277
And perhaps, if I'm successful,
you won't have to...

28:11.676 --> 28:14.407
and we can be together
with their full blessing.

28:15.972 --> 28:17.290
But...

28:19.309 --> 28:20.338
in the meantime...

28:20.423 --> 28:21.698
Don't say it.

28:23.188 --> 28:24.964
I don't want
to hear you say it.

28:28.610 --> 28:30.178
Then you never shall.

28:35.534 --> 28:37.003
How's Veronica doing?

28:37.583 --> 28:40.652
Confused, angry, worried.

28:41.216 --> 28:43.034
Yeah, makes sense.

28:45.377 --> 28:47.378
Don't you think
it's crazy that

28:47.462 --> 28:50.059
she had no idea what Archie
was planning to do?

28:50.144 --> 28:51.471
I don't know,
maybe it's just me,

28:51.556 --> 28:53.300
but... it kind of seems
like the two of them

28:53.385 --> 28:55.286
have been squirrelly
since prom.

28:56.429 --> 28:57.906
Did you notice that?

28:58.265 --> 29:00.202
I just don't know
what the problem could be.

29:00.642 --> 29:02.537
What could have
got them derailed?

29:05.438 --> 29:07.653
I think I may know
what happened, Jug.

29:15.981 --> 29:17.231
I have to tell you something.

29:17.316 --> 29:19.117
Oh, no.

29:20.202 --> 29:22.396
During
Hedwig,

29:23.275 --> 29:25.665
Archie and I kissed.

29:26.695 --> 29:29.335
Once, only once. I swear.

29:30.505 --> 29:33.007
And I'm guessing
Archie told Veronica,

29:33.091 --> 29:35.214
and that's why
they've been acting so weird.

29:36.720 --> 29:40.148
I didn't tell you, Jug,
and I'm so sorry.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.088
I should have told you

29:42.183 --> 29:44.168
right when it happened.
I'm sorry.

29:45.163 --> 29:46.856
I'm so sorry.

29:47.731 --> 29:49.632
I'm so sorry.

30:24.365 --> 30:25.782
All right,
I better get going

30:25.866 --> 30:27.646
if I'm gonna get Archie
to the bus stop.

30:28.946 --> 30:32.133
Yeah, I should go see
and be with Veronica.

30:34.083 --> 30:35.901
Hey, when I get back, can we...

30:37.336 --> 30:38.654
talk about us?

30:40.486 --> 30:42.387
Yeah, of course.

30:44.535 --> 30:46.103
I love you, Jug.

30:46.595 --> 30:48.080
I love you, too, Betty.

30:53.102 --> 30:54.953
- Ready to go?
- Yeah, just about.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.629
Hey, come here.

30:57.316 --> 30:58.981
Be a good boy, okay?

30:59.066 --> 31:02.094
Look after Mom.
I love you, buddy.

31:07.450 --> 31:08.825
I love you, Mom.

31:08.909 --> 31:10.184
I love you.

31:12.079 --> 31:13.689
Thank you for everything.

31:36.145 --> 31:37.420
Hey.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.590
I have to apologize to you
about something.

31:42.920 --> 31:44.321
I know, Bee.

31:46.113 --> 31:47.563
And I'm not mad at you.

31:48.829 --> 31:50.564
I can't be. Not today.

31:51.327 --> 31:52.578
I'm

31:52.828 --> 31:54.175
too upset.

31:54.663 --> 31:55.981
I'm sorry.

32:06.300 --> 32:07.618
Listen, Jug.

32:12.056 --> 32:14.792
Before I leave,
I have to tell you something.

32:15.976 --> 32:17.294
Archie, I know.

32:18.437 --> 32:20.506
About you and Betty?
She told me.

32:22.316 --> 32:23.634
It's okay.

32:28.949 --> 32:30.033
Seriously?

32:30.118 --> 32:32.520
Yeah, seriously.

32:34.245 --> 32:36.980
I know neither of you did it
to hurt me or Veronica.

32:38.123 --> 32:40.041
Maybe a little
normal high-school angst

32:40.125 --> 32:41.527
is good for us.

32:44.964 --> 32:47.658
So, yeah, we're okay.

32:48.801 --> 32:52.329
Seriously, we always will be.

32:54.423 --> 32:56.183
I feel so responsible

32:56.267 --> 32:58.351
for what's happening
between you and Archie.

32:58.435 --> 33:01.380
It's not that, Betty. It's not.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.717
It's how it's all ending.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.722
So sudden and unresolved.

33:14.368 --> 33:16.353
I wish I had
said goodbye to him.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.105
You know?

33:21.125 --> 33:23.819
More than anything,
I wish...

33:25.462 --> 33:28.089
I wish I had hugged him
one more time.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.299
Then, let's do that.

33:29.383 --> 33:30.759
His bus may not have left yet.

33:30.843 --> 33:32.844
I know exactly how
we're gonna get there.

33:38.302 --> 33:40.651
- Guys?
- Jughead, where's Archie?

33:40.936 --> 33:43.313
The bus left like a minute ago.
He's gone.

33:43.397 --> 33:45.215
Well, not yet, he's not.
Get in.

35:11.235 --> 35:14.529
Sir, can you pull the bus over?
Please?

35:14.652 --> 35:16.679
It's my girl and my friends.

35:22.507 --> 35:24.576
You stay safe,
Archie Andrews.

35:25.249 --> 35:26.524
I mean it.

35:26.865 --> 35:28.182
I will.

35:30.178 --> 35:31.721
I love you.

35:31.853 --> 35:33.254
I love you.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.165
Later, bro.

35:44.777 --> 35:46.052
Don't "bro" me.

35:56.238 --> 35:57.947
See you in a year, Arch.

35:58.062 --> 35:59.547
See you in a year, Betty.

37:12.079 --> 37:14.705
We'll rebuild here, Nana.

37:15.040 --> 37:17.000
And not just our
ancestral mansion, Thornhill,

37:17.084 --> 37:19.002
which I burned down
in my youth,

37:19.086 --> 37:21.363
but the Blossom name

37:21.922 --> 37:23.282
and legacy.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.433
Once Archie had left,

37:33.684 --> 37:35.685
it was as if the glue
that held our group together

37:35.769 --> 37:37.270
had begun to dissolve.

37:37.354 --> 37:39.573
First to go was Veronica.

37:40.149 --> 37:41.733
Guys, I'm gonna
take a little time off

37:41.817 --> 37:43.468
before school starts.

37:44.382 --> 37:45.651
Spend the summer

37:45.736 --> 37:47.874
with my mom and Andy Cohen
in the Hamptons.

37:47.959 --> 37:49.861
Your mom will love that.

37:51.744 --> 37:53.691
She was gone within a week.

37:54.163 --> 37:56.535
As for Betty and me,
things had changed.

37:56.874 --> 37:58.959
We never talked
about her and Archie,

37:59.084 --> 38:01.904
about the growing distance
between us.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.174
Not even when she announced...

38:04.465 --> 38:06.450
I'm going
to New Haven early.

38:10.095 --> 38:11.346
My mom and I
are taking a road trip

38:11.430 --> 38:13.207
before she drops me off.

38:18.977 --> 38:21.021
You guys deserve the R-and-R.

38:23.359 --> 38:25.375
What's gonna happen to us?

38:27.488 --> 38:29.223
I still love you.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.808
I'll always love you.

38:35.871 --> 38:37.714
I'll always love you, too.

38:44.338 --> 38:47.616
But for now,
you should focus on Yale,

38:48.926 --> 38:50.577
and I'll focus on Iowa.

39:04.483 --> 39:06.029
After Betty left,

39:06.114 --> 39:08.937
it didn't feel right to keep
living at the Coopers' anymore.

39:12.825 --> 39:14.534
So, I moved
into Archie's house,

39:14.618 --> 39:16.244
which was empty
for the time being,

39:16.328 --> 39:17.688
waiting to be sold.

39:20.290 --> 39:22.150
Then they cut the electricity.

39:27.089 --> 39:30.050
Which was fine, but,
then the gas was shut down

39:30.134 --> 39:31.898
and with it the hot water.

39:32.344 --> 39:35.872
So, I sought refuge in a place
I knew all too well.

39:37.766 --> 39:40.544
Honey? I'm home.

39:42.842 --> 39:44.365
I stayed there until August,

39:44.450 --> 39:45.937
when it was finally time
for me to go

39:46.022 --> 39:48.174
where no Jones man
had gone before.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.094
College.

39:51.739 --> 39:54.141
But I couldn't leave town
without one last burger.

39:57.286 --> 39:59.896
I'm gonna miss seeing you
in here every day.

40:01.248 --> 40:03.066
I'm gonna miss you, too, Pop.

40:17.181 --> 40:20.126
As I paid the check and headed
towards my future, I wondered...

40:20.559 --> 40:22.929
would we keep the vow
that we made on the bleachers,

40:23.187 --> 40:25.694
to return home to our booth
at Pop's one year later?

40:25.939 --> 40:27.466
Only time would tell.

40:40.704 --> 40:46.556
<i>♪ I can't blame myself
For loving you the way... ♪</i>

40:46.752 --> 40:48.236
Another refill, Jug?

40:49.463 --> 40:52.610
Uh, no, I'm good.
I think it's time I take off.

40:52.695 --> 40:54.551
I'm sorry they didn't make it.

40:54.635 --> 40:56.328
They're probably just busy.

40:57.221 --> 40:59.180
Yeah, probably.

40:59.264 --> 41:04.728
<i>♪ You're nonchalant
And kind of wild... ♪</i>

41:07.314 --> 41:14.612
<i>♪ I can't blame myself

41:14.696 --> 41:18.783
<i>♪ So love me now... ♪</i>

41:18.867 --> 41:21.645
It would be six years
before I saw my friends again.

41:22.245 --> 41:23.788
We'd be different people,

41:24.039 --> 41:25.442
each of us,

41:25.749 --> 41:28.096
brought together by, of course,

41:28.252 --> 41:30.445
a new crisis and mystery.

41:32.736 --> 41:34.937
But that's another story

41:35.620 --> 41:37.383
for another day.
