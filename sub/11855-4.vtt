WEBVTT

00:06.208 --> 00:07.667
(male #1)
And now live

00:07.750 --> 00:09.750
from Folsom Prison..

00:09.834 --> 00:11.458
'Hello. I'm Johnny Cash.'

01:45.583 --> 01:47.041
Northern State Penitentiary.

01:47.125 --> 01:50.000
- They say it's haunted.
- Haunted?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.667
Heard that's why they
closed
it down in the early '70s.

01:52.750 --> 01:54.208
And you believe that?

01:55.750 --> 01:57.834
So, what are we doing here?

01:57.917 --> 02:00.291
Two kids out
here
playing around.

02:00.375 --> 02:01.583
The ground
opens up on 'em.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.166
A sinkhole?

02:03.250 --> 02:05.709
Lands 'em right into what
we
think is an old escape
tunnel.

02:05.792 --> 02:07.542
(Lilly)
'Boys find
a bag of bones?'

02:07.625 --> 02:09.959
And a prison issue uniform.

02:10.041 --> 02:11.041
Prison break?

02:11.125 --> 02:12.792
That's hot.

02:12.875 --> 02:14.625
Any idea who
the digger is?

02:14.709 --> 02:17.083
We got his ID patch.

02:17.166 --> 02:19.917
Prison number 50126.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.125
Boss is on the phone with
the Department of Corrections.

02:22.208 --> 02:23.458
We got a match.

02:23.542 --> 02:25.333
Wonder how he died?

02:25.417 --> 02:26.542
Tunnel collapsed.

02:26.625 --> 02:29.458
Suffocated trying to escape.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.959
- What's up, Boss?
- Scotty, Lil.

02:32.041 --> 02:34.709
- So?
- Meet Hank Dempsey.

02:34.792 --> 02:38.458
'Inmate at Northern State
starting in June, 1965.'

02:38.542 --> 02:40.583
- So, he's been here awhile.
- Here's the weird part.

02:40.667 --> 02:41.709
Corrections
has him down

02:41.792 --> 02:44.083
as a murder victim in 1968.

02:44.166 --> 02:46.625
So, there's a box on this job?

02:46.709 --> 02:48.542
But Hank was
supposedly murdered

02:48.625 --> 02:50.458
inside
the prison walls

02:50.542 --> 02:53.166
and his body was cremated.

02:53.250 --> 02:56.083
So, this guy died twice?

02:56.166 --> 02:58.125
Told you this
place is
haunted.

03:42.375 --> 03:45.458
The ME says Hank didn't
suffocate in the tunnel.

03:45.542 --> 03:47.959
Skeleton shows blunt
force to the head.

03:48.041 --> 03:49.417
We find a murder weapon?

03:49.500 --> 03:51.792
No. But, CSU's doing a
what's-what on the tunnel.

03:51.875 --> 03:55.083
- What's the box look like?
- A snow job.

03:55.166 --> 03:58.709
Hank Dempsey, 24,
was recovering from an illness

03:58.792 --> 04:00.041
in the infirmary.

04:00.125 --> 04:01.458
That we know.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.875
And then it
gets screwy.

04:02.959 --> 04:04.250
Supposedly, Hank
was found murdered

04:04.333 --> 04:06.250
in a hallway
outside the infirmary.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.792
Says Correctional Officer

04:07.875 --> 04:09.875
Mike Jaden discovered the body.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.625
(Lilly)
'But Homicide
wasn't notified'

04:11.709 --> 04:14.166
until 48 hours after the murder.

04:14.250 --> 04:15.417
48 hours?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.542
Plenty of time to get
your story straight.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.208
And doctor up death records.

04:19.291 --> 04:21.208
Hank's remains were
sent to county morgue

04:21.291 --> 04:24.083
and mistakenly cremated.

04:24.166 --> 04:25.375
So, a cover-up.

04:25.458 --> 04:26.625
But why?

04:26.709 --> 04:29.083
We're hoping
Bryce Wilbur can tell us.

04:29.166 --> 04:30.458
He was warden at the time.

04:30.542 --> 04:32.375
Did a search,
Wilbur's now running the show

04:32.458 --> 04:34.083
up at Tipley
Correctional.

04:34.166 --> 04:35.583
What about
family? Hank have any?

04:35.667 --> 04:39.542
No. But from the
interviews, we got a cell
mate

04:39.625 --> 04:40.667
James Hill.

04:40.750 --> 04:42.792
He's also up at Tipley.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.375
You two head up there.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.083
I'll put Vera and Jeffries
on this guard, Mike Jaden.

04:47.166 --> 04:48.500
Yeah, good.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.959
Northern State housed
some bad boys in its day.

04:51.041 --> 04:52.792
What was Hank's story?

04:52.875 --> 04:54.875
Guy was doing 20 years

04:54.959 --> 04:56.959
for stealing a pair of shoes?

04:59.458 --> 05:01.458
Pull.

05:01.542 --> 05:02.875
Shoot.

05:02.959 --> 05:04.500
(Jeffries)
'Come on, Mike.'

05:04.583 --> 05:06.208
Your name's
on the report.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.500
Says you're the
officer that found the body.

05:08.583 --> 05:10.542
Now you know
we found the body.

05:12.291 --> 05:15.041
Look, we thought
Hank had escaped.

05:15.125 --> 05:17.250
Okay, but a man escapes

05:17.333 --> 05:19.542
what happened to
the chasing after him part?

05:19.625 --> 05:21.375
We did look for him. Six hours.

05:21.458 --> 05:23.291
Six hours? That's it?

05:23.375 --> 05:26.208
That's when the warden
called off the search.

05:26.291 --> 05:28.417
Wanted us hush-hush.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.333
Story was to be,
Hank was murdered.

05:30.417 --> 05:32.583
And you went along
with that, no questions asked?

05:32.667 --> 05:35.583
Shoot, boy,
I was dancing a jig.

05:35.667 --> 05:36.625
It was my fault

05:36.709 --> 05:38.083
he got loose.

05:38.166 --> 05:40.625
So how's that go down?

05:40.709 --> 05:44.709
This was the evening that
Johnny Cash was on the radio

05:44.792 --> 05:46.583
playing live
at Folsom Prison.

05:46.667 --> 05:50.792
So, most of the inmates and COs
had gathered in the mess hall.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.041
And?

05:52.125 --> 05:55.625
I had to haul an
unruly inmate back to his
cell.

05:55.709 --> 05:59.458
On the return trip, I took
up post in the infirmary.

05:59.542 --> 06:01.750
But Hank was still
on the ward then?

06:01.834 --> 06:03.500
And some other sickies.

06:03.583 --> 06:04.875
Figured I could
take the night off

06:04.959 --> 06:06.834
'cause all of 'em
were flat on their back.

06:06.917 --> 06:12.917
So, instead of watching Hank,
what, you took a cat nap?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.083
Yeah, something like that.

06:18.458 --> 06:20.333
Claudia..

06:20.417 --> 06:21.667
What you doing there?

06:21.750 --> 06:25.291
Quiet. Keep
your voice down.

06:25.375 --> 06:29.291
Our boys all right over there?

06:29.375 --> 06:31.291
'Everything is fine.'

06:31.375 --> 06:33.291
Good, 'cause I got an ache

06:33.375 --> 06:35.959
over here like
you wouldn't believe.

06:37.291 --> 06:39.917
You're going
to wake everyone up.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.166
Then you'll just have
to find a way to keep me
quiet..

06:43.250 --> 06:44.917
...won't you?

06:48.375 --> 06:49.458
And after
a few minutes

06:49.542 --> 06:50.875
I come out
of the nurse's station

06:50.959 --> 06:53.250
and that bed was empty.

06:53.333 --> 06:55.166
And you never saw
him after that?

06:55.250 --> 06:56.959
It was like Hank
had disappeared.

06:58.333 --> 06:59.959
Alright, now,
I helped you.

07:00.041 --> 07:01.000
Is this
thing going to come back

07:01.083 --> 07:03.834
and bite me in
the ass or what?

07:03.917 --> 07:05.834
Can you tell us
anything else?

07:05.917 --> 07:07.375
How about this?

07:07.458 --> 07:10.000
Since there
was never a body..

07:10.083 --> 07:13.792
...a body was never
sent to the morgue.

07:13.875 --> 07:16.542
Go on.

07:16.625 --> 07:17.834
Well, I was there
when the warden

07:17.917 --> 07:21.000
signed papers saying there was.

07:25.750 --> 07:28.333
In 1968 I had two problems.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.208
One, I was very young

07:31.291 --> 07:35.500
and, two,
the prison was very old.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.583
The governor wasn't
sure either of us

07:37.667 --> 07:39.667
were up for the job.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.959
Hank escaped
one more time

07:41.041 --> 07:42.834
and he was
closing
the place down.

07:42.917 --> 07:44.000
One more time?

07:44.083 --> 07:46.208
He'd done it twice before.

07:46.291 --> 07:47.208
In '65

07:47.291 --> 07:51.458
and again
in late
1967.

07:51.542 --> 07:53.834
But you recaptured him?

07:53.917 --> 07:56.291
First eight,
then another ten years

07:56.375 --> 07:58.375
were added to his sentence.

07:58.458 --> 07:59.834
20 years for
taking shoes

07:59.917 --> 08:01.625
that's pretty stiff.

08:01.709 --> 08:03.000
He got two for stealing

08:03.083 --> 08:05.125
18 for running.

08:05.208 --> 08:09.208
In any event, once he'd
disappeared from the infirmary

08:09.291 --> 08:11.333
I had to look at
the bigger picture.

08:11.417 --> 08:13.667
So you initiated
a phony murder investigation

08:13.750 --> 08:17.083
to cover up what you thought
was a successful escape.

08:17.166 --> 08:18.875
Correct.

08:18.959 --> 08:20.875
The problem is, Warden,
that make-believe murder

08:21.000 --> 08:22.458
turned out to be a real one.

08:22.542 --> 08:24.166
Are you
suggesting I had something

08:24.250 --> 08:27.125
to do with Hank's death?

08:27.208 --> 08:28.750
Did you?

08:28.834 --> 08:30.417
Inmate gets
killed during an escape

08:30.500 --> 08:33.333
not something
I'd need to cover up.

08:33.417 --> 08:34.792
In fact..

08:34.875 --> 08:38.500
...the first time Hank ran
we should've killed him.

08:46.834 --> 08:48.041
There, on
the south wall.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.083
Get! Get! Get!

08:56.166 --> 08:59.000
Git! Git! Git!

09:04.291 --> 09:06.709
Let's bring him down.

09:12.542 --> 09:13.542
I've been
trying to play the hand

09:13.625 --> 09:14.709
I was dealt, Warden.

09:14.792 --> 09:16.709
I truly have.

09:16.792 --> 09:19.709
Next shot
won't be a warning, Hank.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.917
(male #2)
How's it feel way up there
on that wall, huh, Hank boy?

09:24.542 --> 09:25.792
Lonely.

09:29.166 --> 09:31.500
(Warden)
'Screw your head on, son.'

09:31.583 --> 09:33.500
You've only
been here a few months.

09:33.583 --> 09:35.125
It gets easier.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.834
In two years
you'll walk out of here.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.500
'Why jeopardize that?'

09:39.583 --> 09:41.250
Two years.

09:41.333 --> 09:43.291
Might as
well be a life sentence.

09:43.375 --> 09:45.834
Gonna to be longer if you
don't climb down from there.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.166
I just..

09:52.750 --> 09:55.083
I got to get back.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.709
Shoot him.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.500
Jaden, you
sorry son of a bitch.

10:03.583 --> 10:05.917
'Get the dogs out.'

10:10.917 --> 10:14.417
As much as I wanted
to help that boy

10:14.500 --> 10:18.500
had I been doing
the shooting that
night..

10:18.583 --> 10:21.500
...I wouldn't have missed.

10:21.583 --> 10:23.834
Hank wanted to get back.

10:23.917 --> 10:25.375
To where?

10:25.458 --> 10:26.667
Not my concern.

10:26.750 --> 10:28.542
Hunting him down is
what I cared about

10:28.625 --> 10:30.583
'and he
got less than a mile.'

10:32.917 --> 10:35.041
Okay.

10:35.125 --> 10:36.750
Every blue moon some fella

10:36.834 --> 10:40.000
gets it in his
head to tunnel out.

10:40.083 --> 10:43.875
But I never
made Hank for a digger.

10:43.959 --> 10:45.542
How'd he do it?

10:45.625 --> 10:47.959
Still trying to figure that out.

10:49.333 --> 10:52.417
You do, be obliged
to let me know.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.875
You and Hank sharing
a cell three years

10:57.959 --> 11:00.041
'you and him must
have been close'

11:03.458 --> 11:05.375
Soul brothers.

11:05.458 --> 11:09.667
So, did Hank talk much about
how he was going to escape?

11:09.750 --> 11:11.625
No.

11:11.709 --> 11:13.709
Nothing. Ever?

11:13.792 --> 11:14.917
A man betters his chances

11:15.000 --> 11:17.875
if he keeps
such plans to himself.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.875
Okay, but why escape at all

11:19.959 --> 11:22.083
with such a light sentence?

11:22.166 --> 11:25.834
That Hank had a mind of his own.

11:25.917 --> 11:30.083
It says here
you served, uh, six years

11:30.166 --> 11:31.458
at Northern State

11:31.542 --> 11:33.625
and then transferred
here when it closed.

11:33.709 --> 11:35.041
Uh-huh.

11:35.125 --> 11:39.667
So that means for 39 years

11:39.750 --> 11:42.750
Bryce Wilbur is the
only warden you've ever known.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.583
Okay.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.417
What's your opinion of him?

11:48.291 --> 11:50.291
Tough, fair.

11:50.375 --> 11:51.709
Doesn't play around.

11:55.542 --> 11:58.000
How about a former
guard at Northern State

11:58.083 --> 11:59.959
Mike Jaden?

12:00.041 --> 12:01.750
Pretty Girl?

12:01.834 --> 12:03.083
Pretty Girl?

12:03.166 --> 12:04.792
That's what
we used to call him

12:04.875 --> 12:08.792
and not
just inmates, guards, too.

12:15.583 --> 12:17.291
Hank, finish up.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.125
Beat it.

12:42.166 --> 12:43.333
Did you do it?

12:43.417 --> 12:44.667
I think the boys
will appreciate this.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.875
(Jaden over P.A.)
'Yeah, just like that.'

12:48.959 --> 12:51.709
'Okay, I'm going
to unbuckle now.'

12:51.792 --> 12:56.166
'Aha. Ah, there.'

12:56.250 --> 12:57.250
'Look at my face.'

12:57.333 --> 12:58.500
'Now say the magic words.'

12:58.583 --> 13:00.291
(Claudia)
'Really don't wanna.'

13:00.375 --> 13:02.542
(Jaden)
'Come on, you have to.
Otherwise I'm no good.'

13:02.625 --> 13:05.667
'Say it.
Say I'm pretty.'

13:05.750 --> 13:07.250
Come on, say it, say it.

13:07.333 --> 13:08.500
(Claudia)
'You're pretty.'

13:08.583 --> 13:11.333
(Jaden)
'Oh, yeah, that's mighty
good.'

13:11.417 --> 13:13.041
'Now, do the next bit.'

13:13.125 --> 13:14.375
'I'm pretty like what, huh?'

13:14.458 --> 13:17.083
'Say it, pretty like what?'

13:17.166 --> 13:18.709
(Claudia)
'Like a girl.'

13:22.959 --> 13:25.250
(inmates together)
'Pretty girl.'

13:26.083 --> 13:29.041
Shh. Hear that?

13:29.125 --> 13:30.417
What?

13:32.458 --> 13:34.834
What the Sam Hill's
going on in there?

13:37.625 --> 13:41.208
What are
you mutts laughing about?

13:41.291 --> 13:42.834
(inmates together)
'Pretty Girl!'

13:42.917 --> 13:44.166
Hank, you son of a bitch.

13:45.291 --> 13:47.333
You boys are goners!

13:48.959 --> 13:51.792
Damn. That'd be a
reason to go after Hank.

13:51.875 --> 13:54.583
Yeah, and after
Hank disappeared for good

13:54.667 --> 13:57.125
Pretty Girl would
walk on the cell block

13:57.208 --> 13:59.417
cocky, for all to see.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.125
Boasting he'd done the deed?

14:01.208 --> 14:02.583
Not directly.

14:02.667 --> 14:06.375
But guys did start
calling him Officer Jaden
again.

14:11.709 --> 14:13.250
Your bar, huh, Mike?

14:13.333 --> 14:14.500
Bought and paid for.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.208
Nice joint.

14:16.291 --> 14:17.375
It's a living.

14:18.667 --> 14:19.750
I'd offer you a drink

14:19.834 --> 14:21.709
but I used up
all my
hospitality

14:21.792 --> 14:23.250
on the other two.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.041
Use up
all your lies, too?

14:26.417 --> 14:27.834
How'd I lie?

14:27.917 --> 14:30.291
You didn't tell us about
this itchin' you had for
Hank.

14:30.375 --> 14:32.250
How he made you
jackass number one.

14:32.333 --> 14:33.959
'Punked by
all the inmates.'

14:34.041 --> 14:35.500
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.959
Hey, that
happened to me, I'd start

14:37.041 --> 14:38.166
drinking for a living, too.

14:38.250 --> 14:40.458
Yeah, but say
I'm a "Pretty Girl"

14:40.542 --> 14:41.834
who had a score to settle

14:41.917 --> 14:45.291
I might just man-up
and see to that first.

14:45.375 --> 14:47.417
I didn't kill Hank Dempsey.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.875
But I did want
to settle a
score.

14:50.959 --> 14:53.458
So, what'd you do?

14:53.542 --> 14:56.417
Planted two boxes
of "Duffy's Hay" in Hank's
cell.

14:57.834 --> 14:59.792
- "Duffy's Hay"?
- Smokes.

14:59.875 --> 15:01.834
How'd having
the smokes hurt Hank?

15:01.917 --> 15:03.917
Triple murderer
named Johnny Harkin

15:04.000 --> 15:06.625
controlled the action.

15:06.709 --> 15:09.875
Guy was a
half-tweaked hate machine.

15:09.959 --> 15:11.542
You plant
Johnny's smokes on Hank

15:11.625 --> 15:13.166
then tell Johnny
who's got 'em.

15:13.250 --> 15:15.625
Thinking Johnny
would kill Hank.

15:15.709 --> 15:17.834
If not him,
one of his
crew.

15:17.917 --> 15:19.875
So, you think he pulled it off?

15:19.959 --> 15:23.917
Now that you tell me Hank
was murdered, seems possible.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.250
Any idea on where
Johnny is today?

15:26.333 --> 15:29.291
Yeah. Dead.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.625
- Dead?
- Dead.

15:31.709 --> 15:33.458
(Tom)
'Prison grapevine
says he was killed'

15:33.542 --> 15:36.333
'in a knife fight in Detroit.'

15:36.417 --> 15:38.458
Can't say I'm really
sorry about it either.

15:44.458 --> 15:45.625
Only way into that tunnel

15:45.709 --> 15:48.291
was through
an old air vent, in the
library.

15:48.375 --> 15:50.458
Yeah, but Hank
was in the infirmary.

15:50.542 --> 15:52.792
The library
and infirmary share a wall.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.750
He could go through
the ceiling tiles?

15:54.834 --> 15:56.667
Hm-mm, so, Hank crawls

15:56.750 --> 15:58.417
20 feet
through the vent

15:58.500 --> 15:59.667
hits a dead end.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.875
What's he do?

16:00.959 --> 16:03.291
Digs. Through
three feet of dirt

16:03.375 --> 16:04.417
which then
drops him into

16:04.500 --> 16:05.834
and this is the beauty part

16:05.917 --> 16:09.875
an existing tunnel
from a 1945 12-man escape.

16:09.959 --> 16:11.166
Cool.

16:11.250 --> 16:13.709
And that tunnel
goes under Fairmount Avenue

16:13.792 --> 16:16.583
'comes out a manhole
cover over on 22nd Street.'

16:16.667 --> 16:18.792
Hmm, a block from the prison.

16:18.875 --> 16:20.834
These guys in '45 get away?

16:20.917 --> 16:23.875
Entire dirty dozen were
captured within an hour.

16:23.959 --> 16:27.250
The question is how did Hank
know where that old tunnel was?

16:27.333 --> 16:28.417
Another question.

16:28.500 --> 16:30.083
What's in Bucks County?

16:30.166 --> 16:31.417
The second time Hank ran

16:31.500 --> 16:33.542
he was recaptured
outside the city.

16:33.625 --> 16:37.458
Vera's over there now
getting their police report.

16:37.542 --> 16:39.375
The guard, Jaden,
pointed to this Johnny Harkin?

16:39.458 --> 16:41.625
The problem with him
as our doer, he was released

16:41.709 --> 16:43.250
two weeks
before Hank was killed.

16:43.333 --> 16:44.750
If Johnny's on the outside

16:44.834 --> 16:47.458
maybe his long arm
still got things done.

16:47.542 --> 16:49.500
Who was his
number one henchman?

16:49.583 --> 16:51.959
His old
cell mate, Wendell Foyt.

16:52.041 --> 16:54.333
We know what
became of Wendell?

16:54.417 --> 16:56.458
Hal's Auto, Germantown.

17:03.917 --> 17:06.250
You heard about Detroit, huh?

17:06.333 --> 17:08.583
Knife fight that killed Johnny?

17:08.667 --> 17:10.667
Yeah, tough luck.

17:10.750 --> 17:12.375
Me and Johnny
ran the mail room.

17:12.458 --> 17:16.417
So, running the contraband
made you two "King of the
Hill."

17:16.500 --> 17:18.875
(Foyt)
The mail room
gave us power.

17:18.959 --> 17:21.917
Droppin' guys
made us king.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.333
Here, shake.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.500
- Still strong, right?
- Yeah.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.500
Working on these
the past 30 years

17:29.583 --> 17:31.125
kept me that way.

17:31.208 --> 17:33.792
So, Wendell, when Hank
stole those smokes from you

17:33.875 --> 17:35.959
you do something with
those strong hands of yours?

17:36.041 --> 17:39.083
Won't deny, I told Johnny
we should get Hank alone

17:39.166 --> 17:41.250
and cut him up.

17:41.333 --> 17:43.041
What did Johnny say?

17:43.125 --> 17:45.792
No. We would do it
in the mess hall.

17:45.875 --> 17:48.208
For all to see.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.291
I'll trade you
my fruit cocktail.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.500
Hi, Hank.

18:01.166 --> 18:02.291
I've been
waiting for you fellas.

18:02.375 --> 18:03.834
You were waiting for us?

18:03.917 --> 18:05.667
(Hank)
'Smokes are still
in their cartons'

18:05.750 --> 18:08.959
'cept for one or two
I gave to my pal, James, here.

18:12.750 --> 18:14.208
I was set up.

18:14.291 --> 18:16.000
Shh, shush.

18:16.083 --> 18:19.917
Now, in 30 seconds,
your insides'll be spilling

18:20.000 --> 18:22.208
on the floor.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.792
Any last wishes?

18:26.500 --> 18:27.709
Tell me about Willie Harkin.

18:30.917 --> 18:33.500
- Who?
- My daddy.

18:33.583 --> 18:36.291
Sorry, I got the name
wrong. I meant your grand pops.

18:36.375 --> 18:39.417
Gramps and my dad
were both named Willie.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.875
Now, what in the hell
do you know about them?

18:42.959 --> 18:45.500
They both did
time in this prison.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.458
Both did murders.

18:47.542 --> 18:49.667
One of them, I think

18:49.750 --> 18:52.417
your grandpa, lived in my cell.

18:52.500 --> 18:54.375
What are ya talking about?

18:54.458 --> 18:56.792
Name is
etched on the wall.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.458
If you wanna
see it, I'd show you.

19:09.625 --> 19:13.250
Coming by your cell
later,
grab those smokes.

19:13.333 --> 19:15.000
No problem.

19:15.083 --> 19:18.583
Hey, on your mother,
you didn't steal from us,
right?

19:20.041 --> 19:22.125
What good's a pack
of smokes to me?

19:22.208 --> 19:23.917
My wife made me quit.

19:27.792 --> 19:30.208
Pretty cool
customer, that Hank.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.792
My hat was off to him.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.375
(Valens)
'What about this "wife"?'

19:33.458 --> 19:35.583
Our records don't
show Hank had anyone.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.375
I don't know about a wife.

19:37.458 --> 19:39.250
But he would talk
about his sweetheart

19:39.333 --> 19:41.583
'from Bucks County.'

19:41.667 --> 19:44.375
Bobbi something..

19:48.458 --> 19:50.208
Old Hank got himself
in all this trouble

19:50.291 --> 19:52.125
because Bobbi wanted
a pair of shoes.

19:52.208 --> 19:53.375
They weren't shoes.

19:53.458 --> 19:55.667
They were
boots. Knockoffs.

19:55.750 --> 19:59.500
Like Nancy Sinatra's
"Made For Walking" boots.

19:59.583 --> 20:00.917
He knew I loved them.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.125
So Hank went out
and got 'em for
you.

20:03.208 --> 20:04.333
Women and shoes.

20:04.417 --> 20:07.250
Anyway, that
was a long time ago.

20:07.333 --> 20:10.667
Our records show when Hank
escaped that second time

20:10.750 --> 20:12.166
'December '67'

20:12.250 --> 20:14.625
he was caught in Bucks County,
at your aunt's house.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.041
I was staying there.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.792
He came straight
to me the second he escaped.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.333
Kinda shortsighted, wasn't it?

20:21.417 --> 20:23.625
Hank was compulsive.

20:23.709 --> 20:26.333
(Lilly)
Just couldn't stay away.

20:26.417 --> 20:28.375
Now this one's
over the moon.

20:28.458 --> 20:30.375
(Bobbi)
Anyway, in the end

20:30.458 --> 20:32.375
I found
the right person for me.

20:32.458 --> 20:34.792
Lyle and I have
been married for 25 years.

20:34.875 --> 20:38.625
Like this Hank was
some sort of Steve McQueen.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.959
Tell 'em about that
night at your aunt's house.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.333
It's okay.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.208
Hank, what are you doing here?

20:48.291 --> 20:50.417
I always told
you when I got out

20:50.500 --> 20:52.166
I'd come
straight to my wife.

20:52.250 --> 20:53.500
Baby, there's no time.

20:53.583 --> 20:54.667
You need to run.

20:54.750 --> 20:55.875
Shh, close your eyes.

20:55.959 --> 20:58.000
- Hank.
- Bobbi, please.

21:01.250 --> 21:03.333
You weren't listening.

21:05.166 --> 21:07.542
Bobbi Jean Banks..

21:07.625 --> 21:09.333
...will you be my wife?

21:11.834 --> 21:14.250
Hank, you can't
come all this
way

21:14.333 --> 21:16.375
just to let them
catch you again.

21:16.458 --> 21:17.458
It was worth it.

21:17.542 --> 21:19.250
Hold it right there, Hank.

21:21.542 --> 21:25.542
Oh, ah, oh, ah.

21:30.417 --> 21:33.542
That's twice now
you've run on me, Hank.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.166
Laundry truck
had my name on it, Warden.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.458
Evening.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.291
Oh, casserole. How nice.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.709
Do you mind?

21:58.291 --> 22:01.917
Mmm. It's only so-so, Hank.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.750
'You'd do just as good
back at the House.'

22:03.834 --> 22:05.834
I'll come
back to you. Promise.

22:07.792 --> 22:09.625
No. Hank.

22:10.792 --> 22:14.750
Aah! Aah!

22:14.834 --> 22:16.375
You won't.

22:20.834 --> 22:22.917
Save the rest for when you
get back to your cell, okay?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.291
I didn't get
your answer.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.709
(Warden)
'Wave bye-bye, Miss.'

22:25.792 --> 22:27.542
You're never going
to see Hank again.

22:27.625 --> 22:28.750
(male #3)
'Come on!'

22:28.834 --> 22:30.166
[whispers]
Yes.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.291
Lucky for me that
warden meant what he said.

22:41.375 --> 22:44.125
He always
makes it so easy for me.

22:44.208 --> 22:46.000
We'll leave you
to your gardening.

22:48.333 --> 22:51.000
Detective Rush..

22:51.083 --> 22:53.041
I knew when
I opened that package

22:53.125 --> 22:54.959
he couldn't
have paid for those
boots

22:55.041 --> 22:56.750
but I wanted
them so much.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.041
I always
regretted
that.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.792
It wouldn't have mattered.

23:00.875 --> 23:03.709
Hank would never have
let you give those boots
back.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.834
How do you know?

23:05.917 --> 23:10.125
'Cause I knew someone
just like him...once.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.834
We think the
Warden's got skeletons

23:18.917 --> 23:21.041
in his closet, James.

23:22.709 --> 23:24.667
Yeah, we
also think he's a lot
more

23:24.750 --> 23:28.625
than "tough" and
"fair," like you
told me.

23:28.709 --> 23:30.125
Okay.

23:30.208 --> 23:32.125
'We checked his
personnel file.'

23:32.208 --> 23:35.041
27 reports of misconduct.

23:35.125 --> 23:36.792
(Rush)
Maybe you said what
you said because you've been

23:36.875 --> 23:39.583
under his watch for 40 years.

23:39.667 --> 23:42.500
So, what if we got you
transferred outta here?

23:42.583 --> 23:44.000
(Valens)
'Houtzdale, Chester'

23:44.083 --> 23:46.166
whatever you want, James.

23:46.250 --> 23:48.333
Today?

23:48.417 --> 23:49.542
Today.

23:54.417 --> 23:56.834
I was in the cell
when they brought Hank back

23:56.917 --> 23:59.166
from his
lady's place that night.

23:59.250 --> 24:00.667
What kind of shape was he in?

24:00.750 --> 24:02.333
He was holding up.

24:02.417 --> 24:05.834
He showed me the fork
wounds on his hand.

24:05.917 --> 24:07.208
Nasty.

24:08.750 --> 24:11.333
Anything else
happen that night?

24:11.417 --> 24:12.667
Yeah.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.667
The warden happened.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.166
Hey.

24:24.333 --> 24:27.250
You're making me look bad, Hank.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.208
'And I got enough trouble
with the rats'

24:29.291 --> 24:31.667
'and water
in this place, yes?'

24:34.208 --> 24:35.875
You saw her, Warden.

24:37.291 --> 24:39.917
I can't help it.
I got the fever.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.083
Little gal's got you
going the wrong way, Hank.

24:44.166 --> 24:45.625
'You already had
eight years put on.'

24:45.709 --> 24:46.792
'Now, it'll be ten more.'

24:46.875 --> 24:48.750
'Does that make sense?'

24:50.000 --> 24:51.166
Gimme your hand.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.542
Now, I want you
to tell every last soul

25:03.625 --> 25:04.834
in this ever-lovin' prison

25:04.917 --> 25:06.917
that you'll
never get on me again.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.250
Otherwise..

25:08.333 --> 25:09.417
...you and me gonna

25:09.500 --> 25:12.709
have a little game
of Little Piggy.

25:12.792 --> 25:14.083
(James)
Hank. Go on.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.542
Say it.

25:16.959 --> 25:18.166
I'd be lying.

25:23.542 --> 25:25.500
This one went to the market.

25:27.083 --> 25:28.208
Come on, Hank.

25:28.291 --> 25:30.000
It's gotta hurt more than that.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.083
No? Okay.

25:37.333 --> 25:39.500
This little
piggy stayed home.

25:45.333 --> 25:47.166
Damn it, boy! Let 'em hear!

25:53.542 --> 25:56.625
After the pliers,
they took him out.

25:56.709 --> 25:59.125
Later, I heard talk
about him getting wailed on

25:59.208 --> 26:01.625
with a Louisville Slugger.

26:04.291 --> 26:06.041
Okay, James.

26:06.125 --> 26:08.125
You're coming with us.

26:08.208 --> 26:09.458
Let you stay in Hotel Homicide

26:09.542 --> 26:11.625
till we get
that transfer worked out.

26:20.709 --> 26:23.875
Lil, I called the
State Police about the warden.

26:23.959 --> 26:26.834
Well, James says he's been
terrorizing inmates for
years.

26:26.917 --> 26:28.834
He put a hurtin' on
Hank back in '68?

26:28.917 --> 26:31.166
Hank never would cry, "Uncle."

26:31.250 --> 26:32.667
Gotta admire that.

26:32.750 --> 26:35.333
The guy had heart.

26:35.417 --> 26:37.458
You're supposed to be
on the side of the law, Lil.

26:37.542 --> 26:40.125
I can't be on the
side of this warden.

26:40.208 --> 26:42.375
So how do you
figure him as the doer?

26:42.458 --> 26:44.542
Hank died
from blunt-force trauma.

26:44.625 --> 26:47.792
This baseball bat
could be the murder weapon.

26:47.875 --> 26:50.000
Maybe why he was in the
infirmary, not pneumonia.

26:50.083 --> 26:53.125
Mm-hmm. A month later,
say he died from the
injuries.

26:53.208 --> 26:54.792
The warden dumps
the body in a tunnel

26:54.875 --> 26:56.709
no one knows about.

26:56.792 --> 26:58.000
Hmm.

26:58.083 --> 27:00.166
What about this nurse
who was treating him?

27:00.250 --> 27:03.458
Scotty's paying
her a house call.

27:03.542 --> 27:05.917
Ms. Valez, I don't mean
to be too personal.

27:06.000 --> 27:08.959
It's okay. Yeah.

27:09.041 --> 27:12.041
I'd pass the time
with Jaden there for a while.

27:12.125 --> 27:16.875
- AKA Pretty Girl?
- AKA The Big Dud.

27:16.959 --> 27:18.375
But he was harmless.

27:18.458 --> 27:19.792
So the night
Hank was brought

27:19.875 --> 27:23.083
into the infirmary,
was there a head wound?

27:23.166 --> 27:24.208
Not that I recall.

27:24.291 --> 27:26.500
Body bruises,
like he took a beating.

27:26.583 --> 27:28.000
Plus, the hand was mangled.

27:28.083 --> 27:29.917
Real bad.
Two fingers broke.

27:30.000 --> 27:32.709
And during the month,
uh, Hank was with you

27:32.792 --> 27:34.500
the warden ever pay a visit?

27:34.583 --> 27:37.417
I think the warden
did enough, don't you?

27:37.500 --> 27:39.166
Anyone come to see Hank?

27:39.250 --> 27:42.583
Only his friend, Johnny
and he came to help.

27:42.667 --> 27:46.667
So, Hank and Johnny
became friends?

27:46.750 --> 27:48.583
Real good ones.

27:50.834 --> 27:52.750
- Claudia.
- Johnny.

27:52.834 --> 27:54.083
Hear you're getting out.

27:54.166 --> 27:55.959
Tomorrow morning.

27:56.041 --> 27:57.083
Maybe I'll find

27:57.166 --> 28:00.792
your house,
we can have a date.

28:00.875 --> 28:01.917
Hey, Johnny!

28:02.000 --> 28:03.291
Cool it.

28:03.375 --> 28:05.375
Yeah, right.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.583
I'm sorry.
That was stupid.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.750
Call that number
like I told ya?

28:14.333 --> 28:16.417
Falcon will take care of us.

28:16.500 --> 28:19.750
Good. Now,
do your part.

28:19.834 --> 28:21.375
You got till
"The Man In Black" comes

28:21.458 --> 28:22.834
to pull your strength together.

28:22.917 --> 28:25.375
Johnny, better git.

28:25.458 --> 28:27.750
Hey, Johnny.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.417
You're true blue.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.458
'Member, that's
what sets you apart

28:33.542 --> 28:34.667
from the rest
of your family.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.875
Ah. Ah.

28:40.083 --> 28:41.875
Me and "The Boss"
will be waiting

28:41.959 --> 28:42.959
for you
on the other side.

28:49.542 --> 28:51.291
Johnny was
helping Hank escape.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.125
And I never reported it

28:54.208 --> 28:57.417
'cause I'd always felt
that Hank got a bum deal.

28:57.500 --> 29:00.875
What about, uh, "The Boss"?

29:00.959 --> 29:02.458
Any idea who that was?

29:02.542 --> 29:04.458
No, but if he
was as handsome

29:04.542 --> 29:07.709
as Hank and Johnny,
I'd like to meet him.

29:09.625 --> 29:11.166
(Lilly)
'Johnny Harkin was paroled'

29:11.250 --> 29:13.583
<i>before</i>
the Johnny Cash broadcast.

29:13.667 --> 29:16.375
And left with the intention
of helping Hank bust loose.

29:16.458 --> 29:18.500
Turns out Johnny's
granddad, Willie Harkin

29:18.583 --> 29:21.166
was one of the 12
that built the tunnel in
'45.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.792
So, stories about the tunnel
are passed down over the years

29:23.875 --> 29:26.375
'and Johnny tells his pal
Hank where to find it.'

29:26.458 --> 29:28.500
(Valens)
'So Johnny knows
about the old tunnel.'

29:28.583 --> 29:30.166
Why doesn't he
ever try and escape?

29:30.250 --> 29:32.375
Well, he was serving
five, out in three.

29:32.458 --> 29:34.834
'Why risk doing time
you don't have to?'

29:34.917 --> 29:37.709
Right, don't be like Hank.

29:37.792 --> 29:38.792
'Rush.'

29:38.875 --> 29:41.333
Hey, Frannie.

29:41.417 --> 29:43.166
Vay-lens.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.458
Get to my bones yet?

29:46.542 --> 29:49.250
For all I know, your dead guy
could've played Rachmaninoff.

29:49.333 --> 29:51.917
No sign of breaks or
fractures on the fingers.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.959
But Hank's fingers
were broken with pliers.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.500
Wouldn't you be
able to see that?

29:56.583 --> 29:59.333
Yes. And I'm telling you
those fingers were good as new.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.792
Valens, you a little stumped?

30:05.667 --> 30:07.500
No, I got it.

30:07.583 --> 30:09.792
Those ain't Hank's hands.

30:09.875 --> 30:13.709
So...those aren't
Hank's bones at all.

30:18.834 --> 30:21.083
Taking a load off.
You don't mind?

30:21.166 --> 30:22.333
It's your house.

30:22.417 --> 30:25.041
You like it?

30:25.125 --> 30:27.709
You, uh, do a lot with a little.

30:28.959 --> 30:32.333
Now, you say it was someone else

30:32.417 --> 30:34.917
wearing Hank's prison
uniform in that tunnel?

30:35.000 --> 30:36.458
Well, we're
checking dental records

30:36.542 --> 30:38.208
but that's what we're thinking.

30:38.291 --> 30:39.750
We know Johnny and someone

30:39.834 --> 30:43.208
called "The Boss"
were helping Hank escape.

30:43.291 --> 30:44.250
Okay.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.500
Well, you
told us Johnny died

30:45.583 --> 30:46.917
so he ain't the skeleton.

30:47.000 --> 30:48.083
Right.

30:48.166 --> 30:49.083
Leaving "The Boss"

30:49.166 --> 30:50.750
but we don't know who that is.

30:50.834 --> 30:53.583
Well, as far
as "The Boss" goes

30:53.667 --> 30:56.250
Johnny wasn't one
to take orders.

30:56.333 --> 30:58.208
So, there's no one he ever
mentioned by that name?

30:58.291 --> 31:00.709
Oh, I didn't say that.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.959
So, one day

31:11.041 --> 31:12.917
I'm out on the stoop

31:13.000 --> 31:14.834
and I catch Bobbi coming my way.

31:16.500 --> 31:18.625
She walking real fast..

31:18.709 --> 31:20.792
(Hank)
'...not in a hurry, you
know, but with purpose.'

31:20.875 --> 31:23.625
What did you say to her?

31:23.709 --> 31:25.333
Nothing comes out.

31:25.417 --> 31:28.125
<i>man.</i>

31:28.208 --> 31:29.458
I know.

31:29.542 --> 31:32.125
She just walks on by,
never looks over.

31:32.208 --> 31:35.000
'This keeps happening
three days in a row.'

31:35.083 --> 31:36.417
Finally, on day four

31:36.500 --> 31:39.792
when I'm 'bout
ready to call it quits

31:39.875 --> 31:43.458
Bobbi slows up, looks over

31:43.542 --> 31:45.333
and sticks her tongue out at me.

31:45.417 --> 31:49.208
Oh, Mother Mary. Mmm.

31:49.291 --> 31:52.291
Just real cute like?

31:52.375 --> 31:54.667
Like it didn't even happen.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.291
So, then what?

31:56.375 --> 31:57.959
I said, "I'm Hank"

31:58.041 --> 32:01.792
and Bobbi says, "'bout time
you showed some manners.

32:01.875 --> 32:03.750
"So, get off
your rear end

32:03.834 --> 32:04.792
and walk me home."

32:07.583 --> 32:10.083
She was bossing
ya like that?

32:10.166 --> 32:12.709
Oh, my. Mmm!

32:12.792 --> 32:15.041
Don't you just love it?

32:15.125 --> 32:17.166
That day on..

32:17.250 --> 32:19.417
...nothing would keep me
from being with that girl

32:19.500 --> 32:21.500
'with the long,
blonde hair.'

32:24.625 --> 32:26.333
What else, Hank?

32:26.417 --> 32:29.166
'What's that bossy
lady o' yours like?'

32:29.250 --> 32:32.083
Bet she can fill
a pair a' blue jeans, huh?

32:33.834 --> 32:36.917
Oh, uh.

32:37.000 --> 32:39.333
Mmm. Um.

32:39.417 --> 32:41.458
Man.

32:41.542 --> 32:43.166
Sandman's coming
to get me, Johnny.

32:44.583 --> 32:45.834
More in the morning.

32:48.083 --> 32:50.542
Johnny always called
her "The Boss" after that.

32:50.625 --> 32:53.542
Johnny gives her that name,
how's it go over with Hank?

32:53.625 --> 32:55.542
Well, Hank was patient with him.

32:55.625 --> 32:58.125
He knew Johnny didn't have much.

32:58.208 --> 33:00.709
Story hour helped him get by.

33:03.875 --> 33:05.875
So, Bobbi's "The Boss."

33:05.959 --> 33:07.458
Hill said the same.

33:07.542 --> 33:09.375
Bobbi's also the Falcon.

33:09.458 --> 33:12.917
DMV shows a Ford Falcon
'62 Sport was registered

33:13.000 --> 33:14.709
in her name.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.542
So, she and Johnny
were gonna get Hank

33:16.625 --> 33:17.834
out of that tunnel together.

33:17.917 --> 33:19.500
Falcon was
the getaway car.

33:19.583 --> 33:20.792
Thing is, we
know Bobbi's still alive

33:20.875 --> 33:22.875
so, those bones
aren't the Bosses'.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.458
And we know they're not Hank's.

33:24.542 --> 33:28.417
Which leaves Johnny but he
supposedly died in Detroit.

33:28.500 --> 33:29.583
But maybe not.

33:29.667 --> 33:30.750
There's no
death certificate

33:30.834 --> 33:33.333
for a Johnny Harkin in Detroit.

33:33.417 --> 33:36.083
Maybe that knife
fight rumor was a sham.

33:36.166 --> 33:38.250
Maybe he died
in that tunnel instead.

33:38.333 --> 33:42.583
So, the bones
in the tunnel are Johnny.

33:42.667 --> 33:43.875
Where's Hank?

33:48.917 --> 33:51.333
- Where's Lyle, Bobbi?
- Well, he went fishing.

33:51.417 --> 33:54.000
And I'm getting
ready to join him.

33:54.083 --> 33:57.125
He seems
like a nice guy. Grounded.

33:57.208 --> 33:59.750
He's a good man.
He's smart, too.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.625
Romance?

34:05.834 --> 34:08.291
You make do.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.959
I know about making do.

34:12.041 --> 34:16.959
I lost my
number one smile...way back.

34:17.041 --> 34:18.250
I'm sorry.

34:20.041 --> 34:22.125
We were gonna move upstate.

34:22.208 --> 34:25.083
- Live on a farm.
- Yeah?

34:25.166 --> 34:28.917
Not that I've ever been upstate.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.250
I just liked the sound of it.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.208
Uh-huh.

34:32.291 --> 34:35.125
Had this image in my mind.

34:35.208 --> 34:36.625
He's out in the field

34:36.709 --> 34:39.917
I'm in the kitchen
with my little girl

34:40.000 --> 34:42.375
telling her about the day
her daddy sold his motorcycle

34:42.458 --> 34:45.583
to buy our wedding bands.

34:46.583 --> 34:48.709
He sounds special.

34:52.875 --> 34:56.041
Been settling
for less ever since.

34:57.417 --> 34:59.250
That's a hard way to live.

34:59.333 --> 35:00.375
No. I'm fine.

35:00.458 --> 35:01.834
Just don't look me in the eye

35:01.917 --> 35:04.041
and tell me you're making do.

35:06.458 --> 35:08.375
Pardon?

35:08.458 --> 35:12.291
You're not sitting
around pining for Hank

35:12.375 --> 35:14.625
because you're with Hank.

35:14.709 --> 35:17.041
'Aren't you?'

35:22.166 --> 35:23.625
You can't arrest me,
my husband told me

35:23.709 --> 35:25.625
the statute of
limitations are up.

35:25.709 --> 35:27.834
'That why you're the
one following behind?'

35:27.917 --> 35:30.041
Safe for you, but not Hank.

35:33.542 --> 35:34.917
You want to sit down?

35:37.875 --> 35:39.709
So, he went fishing, huh?

35:39.792 --> 35:41.792
Want to tell me where?

35:41.875 --> 35:43.709
Just a place.
Somewhere nice.

35:43.792 --> 35:46.333
Somewhere that
doesn't extradite?

35:50.333 --> 35:52.291
He thinks of everything.

35:52.375 --> 35:55.375
Guess Johnny
was just a loose end, huh?

35:55.458 --> 35:58.417
No. Hank thought
of Johnny as a friend.

35:58.500 --> 35:59.750
True blue.

35:59.834 --> 36:01.959
Then how come
Johnny ends up dead?

36:03.458 --> 36:05.709
You wouldn't understand.

36:11.917 --> 36:13.250
Make me.

36:20.834 --> 36:24.166
(Johnny)
'I love how this man sings.'

36:24.250 --> 36:27.250
Stands up there like
a wall of granite

36:27.333 --> 36:29.834
but can still

36:29.917 --> 36:31.542
speak his heart some.

36:33.166 --> 36:35.125
The concert's almost over.

36:35.208 --> 36:37.417
When's he going to get here?

36:37.500 --> 36:39.583
You don't like Johnny Cash?

36:39.667 --> 36:41.875
The manhole cover's
halfway across the road.

36:41.959 --> 36:43.917
'What if we don't
hear Hank's signal?'

36:44.000 --> 36:45.667
He'll be pounding so hard

36:45.750 --> 36:48.208
have to keep him
from waking the neighbors.

36:52.500 --> 36:56.834
Bobbi, these last two weeks..

36:56.917 --> 36:58.000
Cops.

36:59.041 --> 37:02.166
No, it's not.

37:02.250 --> 37:03.875
Bobbi..

37:03.959 --> 37:05.583
...easy.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
Easy.

37:10.417 --> 37:13.458
Your, your hair.

37:18.375 --> 37:20.917
That was stupid.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.500
I didn't mean it.

37:25.583 --> 37:27.959
No, I swear, Johnny..

37:28.041 --> 37:30.000
...you've become
my second favorite man

37:30.083 --> 37:31.875
in the whole world.

37:45.500 --> 37:47.959
Better go see
what's keeping him.

37:48.041 --> 37:50.709
The plan was to
wait until he knocks.

37:50.792 --> 37:52.875
No, this is better.

38:30.917 --> 38:32.625
Johnny?

38:32.709 --> 38:33.917
It's me.

38:34.000 --> 38:36.000
You were
gonna wait above ground.

38:36.083 --> 38:38.208
- 'Where's Bobbi?'
- In the Falcon.

38:38.291 --> 38:39.291
Let's go.

38:39.375 --> 38:42.542
I should...
I should tell you..

38:42.625 --> 38:43.750
...about her.

38:43.834 --> 38:45.250
Bobbi okay,
something wrong?

38:45.333 --> 38:47.291
Yeah. There is.

38:48.667 --> 38:52.166
She's...perfect.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.333
Johnny, you seem off.

38:55.417 --> 38:56.500
Baby, look out!

39:02.125 --> 39:04.583
- Why are you doing this?
- You got what I want!

39:04.667 --> 39:06.125
(Bobbi)
'Johnny!'

39:06.208 --> 39:07.291
Don't hurt him.

39:08.500 --> 39:10.083
'No matter
what you do'

39:10.166 --> 39:12.291
I'll never be yours.

39:20.333 --> 39:23.125
Guess maybe
I already knew that.

39:29.458 --> 39:31.667
This ain't a wrestling match.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.291
Better pick that up, Hank boy.

39:44.875 --> 39:46.583
There.

39:48.333 --> 39:50.834
We're even Steven.

39:50.917 --> 39:55.166
Johnny...it doesn't
have to be this.

39:55.250 --> 39:57.291
I'm a Harkin.

39:57.375 --> 39:59.375
That's my blood.

40:11.125 --> 40:12.208
Hank.

40:13.959 --> 40:15.750
Put on his clothes.

40:18.375 --> 40:20.542
'You're gonna
make it this time.'
