- [crickets chirping]
- [country music playing on radio]

00:13.866 --> 00:17.244
What do you mean, like,
you don't want to marry Kenny?

00:19.538 --> 00:20.706
I don't know.

00:20.790 --> 00:22.458
[stutters] I mean...

00:23.667 --> 00:28.005
Kenny's sweet and loving
and kind and punctual...

00:29.590 --> 00:31.509
I don't know why I just said punctual...

00:32.509 --> 00:33.761
but he really is.

00:34.970 --> 00:36.764
In the mornings, he whispers to me,

00:36.847 --> 00:40.267
"Abby, your alarm's gonna go off
in three, two, one."

00:43.187 --> 00:45.147
Does he do that when you
have sex, too? [Chuckles]

00:47.817 --> 00:50.736
It's just... it feels like
there's something missing.

00:52.405 --> 00:53.948
There's no spark.

00:55.032 --> 00:56.617
There's no adventure.

00:57.660 --> 01:01.330
I don't know if I'm supposed to expect
that after five years or not, but...

01:01.414 --> 01:03.416
Are you sure you're
not just getting colt feet?

01:03.499 --> 01:05.334
I don't know. Maybe.

01:06.585 --> 01:09.922
Wait, did you just say,
"colt feet" with a "T"?

01:11.465 --> 01:15.511
The expression is "cold feet," with
a "D." Like you got in English.

01:16.971 --> 01:19.765
- [scoffs] No, it's not. It's "colt feet."
- [chuckles]

01:19.849 --> 01:23.102
Like... Like when a baby horse
gets born, it's trying to...

01:25.104 --> 01:26.814
"Cold feet"? [Chuckles]

01:27.731 --> 01:28.774
Doesn't make any sense.

01:28.858 --> 01:31.277
Your feet are cold,
just put on some socks.

01:33.654 --> 01:37.032
All I know is, I just... I just
got engaged to this great guy,

01:37.116 --> 01:39.952
and instead of feeling happy about it...

01:41.287 --> 01:43.456
all I'm doing is wondering if you're okay.

01:45.666 --> 01:48.461
Well, I've been wondering the same thing.

01:48.544 --> 01:49.920
[chuckles softly]

01:51.130 --> 01:52.256
So...

01:53.591 --> 01:54.842
what does this mean?

01:54.925 --> 01:56.218
You want to be with me?

01:58.637 --> 01:59.638
I don't know.

02:01.098 --> 02:02.099
You don't know?

02:04.810 --> 02:05.811
Now, hold on.

02:05.895 --> 02:09.023
You don't get to say something like that
and then just say, "I don't know."

02:09.106 --> 02:10.775
- [sighs]
- Like, if I asked you,

02:10.858 --> 02:12.777
"What do you want for dinner?"
You can say, "I don't know."

02:12.860 --> 02:15.070
Or, "Who's better looking,
me or Brad Pitt?"

02:15.154 --> 02:16.822
You can say, "I don't know."

02:18.213 --> 02:20.701
But, "Do you want to be with me?"

02:20.785 --> 02:22.328
You can't say, "I don't know."

02:23.191 --> 02:25.831
Especially when the guy is
better looking than Brad Pitt.

02:26.999 --> 02:28.709
I know!

02:28.793 --> 02:30.544
I know, but...

02:32.296 --> 02:33.297
I don't know.

02:34.131 --> 02:37.026
Okay, well, I've got a girlfriend.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.677
And you've got a fiancÃ©.

02:38.761 --> 02:40.679
[stammers] What do you
want me to do with this?

02:41.847 --> 02:44.767
- I...
- No. Please don't say, "I don't know."

02:46.519 --> 02:48.145
You're right, it's... [sighs]

02:49.063 --> 02:52.575
This isn't fair. I'm... I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have come here.

02:53.108 --> 02:54.360
So you're just going to leave?

02:55.611 --> 02:57.530
I gotta think about everything.

02:58.864 --> 03:00.199
Okay, you're gonna come here,

03:00.282 --> 03:02.952
make a mess of everything,
and then just up and leave?

03:03.035 --> 03:04.578
Who are you, me?

04:14.773 --> 04:16.274
Whoa, you're up early.

04:16.358 --> 04:19.945
Yeah, my mind was racing.
Don't think I slept at all last night.

04:20.029 --> 04:22.615
- Oof...
- I had four beers, then I laid down,

04:22.698 --> 04:24.283
then I had to pee.

04:24.366 --> 04:26.035
So I had another beer
so I could fall asleep.

04:26.118 --> 04:27.745
Of course, I had to pee again.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.205
I couldn't break the cycle.

04:31.373 --> 04:33.167
Except when I finally got up to puke.

04:34.585 --> 04:38.172
You know what you should've done?
Shot of Jameson, shot of NyQuil.

04:38.255 --> 04:39.757
I call it the Irish Lullaby.

04:39.840 --> 04:41.258
[Colt chuckles softly]

04:41.342 --> 04:45.930
Don't do, uh, NyQuil and tequila,
'cause I call that the Mexican Nightmare.

04:47.681 --> 04:49.683
Whew! Oh...

04:50.976 --> 04:52.811
- what happened last night with Abby?
- Oh.

04:52.895 --> 04:54.980
That's what I've been thinking about.

04:55.064 --> 04:56.607
She wants to get back together.

04:56.690 --> 04:58.525
What? She said that?

04:58.609 --> 05:00.736
No, she said, "I don't know."

05:00.819 --> 05:03.739
But... I could tell, she knew.

05:05.532 --> 05:06.992
I mean, this.

05:08.077 --> 05:09.119
I mean, come on, man.

05:09.203 --> 05:10.537
You think every girl you see
wants to be with you.

05:10.621 --> 05:12.373
- Yeah.
- Our high school teacher, Miss Fisher,

05:12.456 --> 05:13.791
you always thought she wanted to bone you.

05:13.874 --> 05:15.167
She did!

05:15.250 --> 05:17.920
She came all the way out here
to "tutor me in math."

05:18.003 --> 05:19.088
Why would she do that?

05:19.797 --> 05:22.591
Probably because you thought
this was nine inches.

05:24.343 --> 05:25.344
Whatever, man.

05:25.427 --> 05:27.680
You're just jealous 'cause the only
teacher that wanted to bone you

05:27.763 --> 05:29.264
was Coach Jenson.

05:29.348 --> 05:31.976
Hey, Coach Jenson saw
potential in me, all right?

05:32.059 --> 05:34.269
He wanted to help me
make the wrestling team.

05:35.437 --> 05:37.815
We didn't have a wrestling team!

05:40.401 --> 05:43.153
Still... made me feel like I belong.

05:46.323 --> 05:49.201
Look, all I know is that
Abby came over here last night

05:49.284 --> 05:51.578
to tell me she's having doubts
about marrying Kenny.

05:51.662 --> 05:53.622
Okay, well, that doesn't mean
she wants to get back with you.

05:53.706 --> 05:55.207
That just means she got colt feet.

05:56.542 --> 05:58.794
You know what, Abby thought
it was "cold feet." [laughs]

06:00.045 --> 06:01.463
No, man, it's colt feet.

06:01.547 --> 06:04.717
You know, like a baby horse,
it's not stable.

06:04.800 --> 06:05.801
"Cold feet."

06:05.884 --> 06:08.595
That doesn't even make any sense.
Just put on a pair of socks.

06:08.679 --> 06:10.305
Thank you!

06:10.389 --> 06:11.390
[snickering] "Cold feet."

06:11.473 --> 06:13.016
- "Cold feet."
- Man, Abby's crazy.

06:13.100 --> 06:15.436
I don't know why you let her
get in your head like that.

06:15.519 --> 06:16.520
I don't know.

06:16.603 --> 06:18.939
We were voted Most Likely to Get Married
in high school.

06:19.022 --> 06:22.443
I mean, it's our duty to give
the people what they wanted.

06:22.526 --> 06:25.988
Well, people also voted you
Most Likely to Succeed,

06:26.071 --> 06:30.117
and here you are, an alcoholic failure
who still lives at home.

06:31.160 --> 06:32.327
So are you.

06:33.912 --> 06:37.416
Yeah, but I was voted Most Likely
to Go to Prison, so, overachiever.

06:38.125 --> 06:40.669
Why do you care so much about what's
going on with me and Abby anyway?

06:40.753 --> 06:43.589
No, believe me, I don't. But
you're always bitching to me about,

06:43.672 --> 06:45.466
you know, you got a great
thing going on with Heather.

06:45.549 --> 06:48.010
Now you're gonna throw that away
for some chick you dated 20 years ago?

06:48.093 --> 06:51.722
I know it's been a while, but every
time we're together it's like...

06:51.805 --> 06:53.307
It's like nothing ever changed.

06:53.390 --> 06:54.558
Yeah, but things have changed.

06:54.641 --> 06:57.478
'Cause for the last five years,
she's been in a relationship with Kenny.

06:57.561 --> 06:59.772
Plus, dude, we got this, like,

06:59.855 --> 07:02.733
smoking-hot mother/daughter
combo thing going on, you know.

07:03.984 --> 07:06.695
I mean, it's only a matter of time
before we swap.

07:07.279 --> 07:09.615
- What?
- Oh, like you haven't thought of it.

07:10.449 --> 07:12.618
No, I haven't!

07:12.701 --> 07:14.369
And don't be having
them thoughts about Heather!

07:14.453 --> 07:16.330
There aren't many thoughts
I haven't had about Heather.

07:16.455 --> 07:19.541
- Dude!
- Dude. Relax. I'm kidding, all right?

07:19.625 --> 07:21.835
She's like a daughter to me.

07:21.919 --> 07:27.633
You know, like a super, super hot,
not blood-related, of-age daughter.

07:31.512 --> 07:32.805
- Morning, Dad.
- Hey, Dad.

07:32.888 --> 07:34.181
[Beau grunts]

07:35.432 --> 07:37.851
Well... he's in a mood.

07:38.602 --> 07:41.980
- What, he didn't even say anything.
- [scoffs] I know all of Dad's grunts.

07:42.064 --> 07:43.732
[grunts] Means, "Don't talk to me."

07:44.817 --> 07:47.111
[growls] Means, "Colt's an idiot."

07:48.362 --> 07:50.489
And when he goes... [grunts twice]

07:50.572 --> 07:53.325
Well, that one's not politically
correct, so I can't say it out loud.

07:53.408 --> 07:55.160
[chuckles]

07:55.244 --> 07:56.703
Hey, Dad. Where's Mom?

07:56.787 --> 08:00.374
She's gone. She hitched up
her Airstream and left.

08:02.126 --> 08:03.252
What?

08:04.336 --> 08:05.420
I thought she was moving in.

08:05.504 --> 08:06.922
So did I.

08:07.005 --> 08:09.341
Did you guys, like,
have a fight? What'd she say?

08:09.424 --> 08:12.136
She didn't say anything.
She left a note.

08:13.053 --> 08:15.722
Doesn't matter. Threw it away.

08:16.306 --> 08:18.100
- Is she coming back?
- Where'd she go?

08:18.183 --> 08:20.144
- You go after her?
- She really didn't say anything?

08:20.227 --> 08:23.021
Yeah, she said,
"Shut the fuck up and get to work."

08:26.150 --> 08:29.111
Okay, well, if you need anything,
just let us know.

08:29.194 --> 08:30.445
[grunts]

08:31.697 --> 08:33.823
I agree. Colt's an idiot.

08:37.285 --> 08:40.496
Man, this whole Mom thing
has got Dad set off.

08:40.581 --> 08:43.792
- Was he this upset when I left?
- [scoffs] That's funny.

08:45.043 --> 08:46.086
I don't know. He seemed all right.

08:46.170 --> 08:49.506
You know, like, when he said, uh,
"Hey, great job flushing the pumps."

08:49.590 --> 08:50.966
He was being sarcastic.

08:51.049 --> 08:52.509
Oh, yeah. I know. That's the trick.

08:52.593 --> 08:54.553
See, if you ignore Dad's sarcasm,

08:54.636 --> 08:57.181
he's like a really, like,
loving, supportive father.

08:57.890 --> 09:01.101
[chuckles] Oh, my God,
that changes everything.

09:01.185 --> 09:04.563
He thinks I'm bright, good with
my hands and he's happy I'm home.

09:05.272 --> 09:08.025
Yeah, and this really is nine inches.

09:10.611 --> 09:12.154
Thank you.

09:14.281 --> 09:15.782
Hey, uh, did Mom hit you back?

09:15.866 --> 09:18.744
No. Haven't heard from her.

09:18.827 --> 09:22.623
I think she just wants to be
left alone. Needs time to think.

09:22.706 --> 09:23.832
[scoffs] Abby needs time to think.

09:23.916 --> 09:27.461
Oh, what's with women?
I don't think before I do anything.

09:28.420 --> 09:29.630
[clicks tongue]

09:29.713 --> 09:32.549
As someone who's seen you lose two
cars in a partially frozen lake,

09:32.633 --> 09:34.092
I can't disagree.

09:34.176 --> 09:36.637
Oh, come on. That don't count.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.806
I drove the second car in
to get the first car out.

09:41.934 --> 09:43.185
- Hey, what's up?
- [grunts]

09:43.268 --> 09:44.478
What are you doing?

09:44.561 --> 09:46.980
Gettin' rid of junk we don't need.

09:49.149 --> 09:51.777
Uh, that looks like
a whole lot of Mom's stuff.

09:51.860 --> 09:54.988
Like I said, junk we don't need.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.532
Oh. Hey, that's my sweater.

09:58.992 --> 10:01.370
You sure this thing with Mom isn't,
like, messing with your head?

10:01.453 --> 10:03.455
This got nothin' to do with your mother.

10:04.373 --> 10:06.208
Okay, I guess those are Colt's bras.

10:09.002 --> 10:12.464
Is that damn bike gonna sit
in my driveway till the day I die?

10:12.547 --> 10:14.466
All right, I'll take care of it.

10:14.549 --> 10:16.218
Do me a favor, don't look in the barn.

10:17.094 --> 10:19.137
You got a week, and I'm haulin' it.

10:19.221 --> 10:20.722
[scoffs]

10:21.848 --> 10:24.851
I'm tired of all the goddamn
clutter around here.

10:24.935 --> 10:27.104
Okay. Well, I'm not the only one
with clutter, all right?

10:27.187 --> 10:31.149
Colt's got clutter. Shit, Colt is clutter.
Why don't you throw him in the barrel?

10:31.233 --> 10:33.402
Whose great idea was it
to leave those tools

10:33.485 --> 10:35.862
laying out there to rust
and waste my money?

10:36.655 --> 10:38.907
That was my great idea, Daddy.

10:38.991 --> 10:40.826
Nice work, genius.

10:40.909 --> 10:42.536
Thank you.

10:43.203 --> 10:45.372
He thinks I'm a genius. [Chuckles]

10:45.455 --> 10:47.207
Put the damn tools away.

10:47.291 --> 10:48.375
Yes, sir.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.378
Are you sure you don't wanna
talk about anything?

10:56.550 --> 10:57.718
Okay, then.

10:59.636 --> 11:01.179
That's my scarf!

11:08.145 --> 11:09.813
Hey, how do I look?

11:09.896 --> 11:10.897
Fine.

11:10.981 --> 11:12.821
All right, good.
I'm taking Mary to the movies.

11:13.775 --> 11:16.945
Now, does this outfit say,
<i>"Madame,</i> would you discreetly

11:17.029 --> 11:20.490
reach your hand into my pants
and give me a handy J?"

11:22.951 --> 11:24.578
What the hell is the matter with you?

11:24.661 --> 11:25.829
Matter with me?

11:25.912 --> 11:26.997
Out of the three Bennett boys,

11:27.080 --> 11:30.125
I'm the only one here in a serious,
healthy relationship.

11:31.585 --> 11:36.173
You're trying to trick a grandmother into
giving you a hand job in a movie theater.

11:36.256 --> 11:38.717
Damn straight. Take notes.

11:39.509 --> 11:41.595
Speaking of relationships,
what's up with you and Heather?

11:41.678 --> 11:42.679
I don't know.

11:42.763 --> 11:46.475
I'm just avoiding her until I can
figure things out with Abby.

11:46.558 --> 11:48.518
Mmm, I don't think that's gonna work.

11:48.602 --> 11:51.563
- Yeah? Avoiding problems don't work?

11:51.646 --> 11:55.192
I got a warrant for my arrest
in Nevada that says it does.

11:55.275 --> 11:57.652
Yeah, I don't think
that's gonna work this time.

11:57.736 --> 11:58.904
Yeah, why not?

11:58.987 --> 12:01.667
'Cause Mary's car is in the driveway
and Heather just got out of it.

12:02.616 --> 12:03.950
[sighs]

12:04.034 --> 12:05.243
- [Mary] Hey, y'all.
- [Rooster] Hey!

12:05.327 --> 12:06.745
Hey.

12:06.828 --> 12:09.206
Hey, Mary. Heather.
My favorite daughter. [Chuckles]

12:11.416 --> 12:12.584
[chuckling] Why're you laughing?

12:12.667 --> 12:15.462
Oh, I was just thinking about this joke
earlier that Colt and I were telling.

12:15.545 --> 12:16.713
You know the one, right, man?

12:16.797 --> 12:18.548
Yeah, yeah.

12:19.674 --> 12:20.675
What're you doing here?

12:20.759 --> 12:24.346
Well, that depends on you and
how many shots of tequila we do.

12:24.429 --> 12:26.515
[chuckles] I'm kiddin', Mom.

12:26.598 --> 12:28.016
[whispers] I'm not kiddin'.

12:29.601 --> 12:30.602
We got plans?

12:30.685 --> 12:33.230
No, but my mom was comin' over
to take Rooster to the movies,

12:33.313 --> 12:35.732
so I thought I'd pop by. Is that cool?

12:35.816 --> 12:37.234
Yeah. Pop bys are cool.

12:37.317 --> 12:39.152
Pop ins are cool, drop bys are cool,

12:39.236 --> 12:42.614
calling and texting first like
everyone else is cool. [Chuckles]

12:43.657 --> 12:45.617
So, uh, what movie should we go see?

12:45.700 --> 12:47.744
<i>This Just Got Weird or Let's
Get the Fuck Out of Here?</i>

12:47.828 --> 12:49.121
[chuckles]

12:49.204 --> 12:50.705
I've heard really good things about

12:50.831 --> 12:52.916
<i>I Will Kill Him If He's
a Dick to My Daughter.</i>

12:52.999 --> 12:54.000
- Right.
- [Colt] Okay, okay, okay.

12:54.084 --> 12:55.377
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

12:55.460 --> 13:00.298
I just... I wasn't expecting you
and I was planning on doing some stuff.

13:00.382 --> 13:01.508
What kind of stuff?

13:01.591 --> 13:02.801
Shut up, Rooster.

13:04.219 --> 13:06.555
Okay, you know what, why don't y'all
come to the movies with us?

13:06.638 --> 13:07.681
That'll be fun. Right?

13:07.764 --> 13:10.267
Yeah, sure. They gotta sneak in
their own beers though.

13:12.102 --> 13:14.271
Actually, um,
can you guys give us a minute?

13:14.354 --> 13:16.022
Yeah. Come on, Rooster. Let's go.

13:16.106 --> 13:18.650
You're sneaking beers into a movie?
[laughs]

13:18.733 --> 13:21.695
You have to reach in my pants
and find out.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.408
So what's going on, Colt?

13:27.659 --> 13:30.078
Nothing. I'm just...

13:30.162 --> 13:33.582
having a bad day.
I lost one of my favorite scarves.

13:35.250 --> 13:38.253
Yeah. Remember when we said
we'd be honest with each other?

13:40.463 --> 13:42.507
Yeah. Look, I just...

13:42.591 --> 13:44.176
I got a lot of stuff going on.

13:44.259 --> 13:47.262
[stutters] My mom just took off,
my dad's been riding me,

13:47.345 --> 13:49.389
- [scoffs] Abby came over last night...
- [smacks table]

13:49.472 --> 13:52.225
There it is.
It always comes back to Abby.

13:52.309 --> 13:54.644
Look, she... she just dropped by.

13:54.728 --> 13:56.563
Oh, so she can drop by, I just can't?

13:56.646 --> 13:57.981
[Rooster] Oh, shit.

13:59.441 --> 14:01.526
No. [Stammering]

14:02.444 --> 14:06.615
She just... She's got some stuff going on
and she needs some advice.

14:06.698 --> 14:08.158
Yeah, but what about me, Colt?

14:08.241 --> 14:09.910
How about I'm tired
of every time I turn around,

14:09.993 --> 14:12.162
I'm face-to-face with your girlfriend
from, like, 20 years ago.

14:12.245 --> 14:14.206
Who, by the way,
is engaged to someone else.

14:14.331 --> 14:16.750
- Look, it's not that simple.
- Then let me make it simple for you.

14:16.833 --> 14:20.003
If Abby was single right now
and you could have either one of us,

14:20.086 --> 14:22.088
who would you choose?

14:23.340 --> 14:24.633
[stuttering]

14:24.716 --> 14:26.593
[Rooster] The right answer is Heather.

14:29.012 --> 14:30.555
No. You're unbelievable.

14:30.639 --> 14:31.973
Heather, wait.

14:33.767 --> 14:36.269
Hey, how'd that go?
You guys ready to go to the movie or what?

14:36.353 --> 14:37.687
Hey, can we just talk about this?

14:37.771 --> 14:39.564
Mom, we gotta go. Now.

14:39.648 --> 14:41.691
Yeah. Sorry, Rooster.
I gotta take her home.

14:41.775 --> 14:43.902
Well, sorry my brother's an asshole.

14:45.070 --> 14:47.322
Heather, stop.
Will you just listen to me?

14:47.405 --> 14:49.074
What, Colt?

14:50.534 --> 14:51.660
Uh...

14:53.828 --> 14:56.915
In the spirit of total honesty,
I didn't really think you were gonna stop.

15:01.628 --> 15:03.672
[music playing on radio]

15:06.341 --> 15:08.343
What in the hell are you doin'?

15:08.426 --> 15:10.929
Oh. Well, I thought it'd be a good idea
to pick up Mom's plants,

15:11.012 --> 15:12.764
bring them over here
and take care of 'em while she's gone,

15:12.847 --> 15:14.641
you know, that way,
when she comes back...

15:14.724 --> 15:17.185
Right now, I'm realizing
this is just gonna piss you off.

15:17.936 --> 15:19.062
I don't want 'em here.

15:19.854 --> 15:22.983
Yeah. No, I get that,
but here's the thing.

15:23.066 --> 15:24.693
If I leave them behind Mom's bar,

15:24.776 --> 15:26.903
that means I gotta walk through her bar
to go get them, right?

15:26.987 --> 15:28.697
Now if I walk through the bar,

15:28.780 --> 15:30.365
I'm gonna stop and have a couple drinks.

15:30.448 --> 15:33.159
If I stop to have a couple drinks,
I'm still gonna water them,

15:33.243 --> 15:35.745
but probably not in a way
that's gonna make Mom very happy.

15:36.830 --> 15:38.623
I'm gonna pee on 'em, Daddy.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.837
If she cared about this stuff,
she'd be here to look after it.

15:43.920 --> 15:45.839
[inhales] Yes. You are right.

15:45.922 --> 15:48.362
That's why I'm gonna take care of it
so it's not your problem.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.722
- They are beautiful.
- Yeah.

15:55.515 --> 15:56.975
Let 'em die.

16:04.482 --> 16:07.027
What's up, Maria? Can I get two beers?

16:07.110 --> 16:08.737
- Oh, I already got one.
- Cool.

16:08.820 --> 16:11.573
What's up, Maria? Can I get two beers?

16:11.656 --> 16:13.908
Sure. But it's gonna be $5.

16:13.992 --> 16:15.869
Just 'cause Mom's gone, I gotta pay now?

16:17.120 --> 16:19.122
I got nothing to live for.

16:19.205 --> 16:23.543
Yeah, Maria, don't you know?
Me and my two brothers drink for free.

16:25.754 --> 16:26.921
Where you been?

16:27.005 --> 16:30.717
I was having dinner over at Mary
and Heather and Darlene's house.

16:31.635 --> 16:33.595
Mary made me a nice plate of fried chicken

16:33.678 --> 16:35.972
with a side of bitching about Colt
for 45 minutes.

16:37.098 --> 16:39.218
I assumed I was gonna get my dessert
in the bedroom...

16:39.809 --> 16:43.730
instead I had a make-your-own sundae in
the Exxon bathroom on the way over here.

16:44.939 --> 16:48.735
Who were you thinking about?
Heather or Coach Jenson? [Chuckles]

16:51.279 --> 16:53.239
- Little bit of both.
- [Colt chuckles] Yeah.

16:53.323 --> 16:54.908
What did they say about me?

16:54.991 --> 16:59.037
Um, well, they said
that you're a selfish jackass

16:59.120 --> 17:03.124
and, uh, an immature dickhead
and that you, uh...

17:03.208 --> 17:06.002
You rode a stellar defense
all the way to the State Championship.

17:08.128 --> 17:10.214
All right, that last one is out of line.

17:11.424 --> 17:13.676
It's your own fault.
I told you not to date her mom.

17:14.803 --> 17:16.846
Right. Yeah, okay. It's my fault.

17:16.930 --> 17:19.557
Oh, before I forget, uh, Heather
wanted me to give you something.

17:19.641 --> 17:21.267
Really? What?

17:21.351 --> 17:22.977
[groans]

17:23.060 --> 17:25.313
- Dude!
- You know, I just did you a solid.

17:25.396 --> 17:26.897
She told me to kick you in the balls.

17:29.150 --> 17:30.735
- Hey, Rooster.
- What's up, Abby?

17:30.819 --> 17:31.820
- Oh.
- Colt.

17:31.903 --> 17:32.904
Hey. Can we talk?

17:32.987 --> 17:35.198
I can't. Kenny's parking the car.
He'll be here any second.

17:35.281 --> 17:37.117
Okay. Well, we can talk fast.
I like that shirt.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.326
Thanks. I like your hat.

17:38.410 --> 17:40.203
- Minnesota Axemen. New perfume?
- Lotion.

17:40.286 --> 17:42.163
- Coconut? Oh.
- Mango.

17:42.247 --> 17:43.498
- You think about us?
- Yes.

17:43.581 --> 17:44.791
- Make a decision?
- No.

17:44.874 --> 17:46.334
Okay. Heather and I broke up
so we are good to go.

17:46.418 --> 17:47.919
What?

17:48.002 --> 17:49.339
Kenny! Hey, what have you been up to?

17:49.359 --> 17:52.654
Oh, not much. Just came from
a crazy bachelor party at the Marriott.

17:52.737 --> 17:55.740
Oh, wow.
Sneak in strippers and trash the place?

17:55.823 --> 17:58.493
No, no, no. It was a party
where we all watched <i>The Bachelor.</i>

18:00.203 --> 18:04.707
Sadly, I lost my top two draft picks
when Rachel and Jessie didn't get roses.

18:04.791 --> 18:06.501
Dude! Spoiler.

18:07.502 --> 18:10.880
But listen, when I have my real
bachelor party, you are definitely coming.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.715
Kenny, we don't have to bore Colt
with the wedding stuff.

18:12.799 --> 18:13.800
Are you kidding me?

18:13.883 --> 18:17.136
Who in this town knows more about
drinking and partying than Colt Bennett?

18:18.262 --> 18:20.556
I'm not that big of a partier.

18:20.640 --> 18:23.476
I'm actually a very mature,
responsible adult...

18:25.061 --> 18:28.564
who has a lot of appealing qualities
as a life partner.

18:28.648 --> 18:30.525
[laughs] Yeah, right.

18:30.608 --> 18:33.695
Says the guy who once sodomized
the Garrison mustang.

18:33.778 --> 18:36.698
Whoa! I did not sodomize that horse.
You were there.

18:36.781 --> 18:39.742
I ran up behind it and tried to hop on.

18:39.826 --> 18:44.622
Except my aim was off
'cause I was drunk. [Chuckles]

18:45.623 --> 18:46.874
And naked.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.627
Covered in Crisco, but that's...

18:50.628 --> 18:52.672
Drunk, naked and covered in Crisco.

18:52.755 --> 18:55.550
Sounds like the bachelor party
I was at. [Chuckles]

18:56.759 --> 18:58.594
But you just said you were
watching <i>The Bachelor.</i>

18:58.678 --> 18:59.804
Yeah, I know, honey.

18:59.887 --> 19:02.348
I just wanted to look cool
in front of Colt.

19:10.356 --> 19:12.442
[Beau] I'll be damned.

19:12.525 --> 19:16.404
[chuckles] That's great.
Chew it up good, girl.

19:17.989 --> 19:19.365
[vehicle approaching]

19:19.449 --> 19:20.783
[chuckles]

19:26.914 --> 19:28.666
What're you doin' out here, Dale?

19:29.417 --> 19:31.085
Evening, Beau.

19:32.045 --> 19:35.173
I'm here to vaccinate your heifers
for Bangs disease.

19:36.090 --> 19:37.967
Oh, shit.

19:38.051 --> 19:41.512
I brought 'em into the pens yesterday
and completely forgot about it.

19:41.596 --> 19:43.890
- What day is today?
- Huh?

19:43.973 --> 19:45.808
I said what day is today?

19:45.892 --> 19:46.934
Oh, thanks.

19:47.018 --> 19:49.979
They're just regular Wranglers,
boot cut, you know. [Chuckles]

19:52.857 --> 19:56.360
I heard about Maggie.
You wanna talk about that?

19:56.444 --> 19:57.904
Nope.

19:57.987 --> 20:02.075
Well, I guess I can't expect you
to pour your heart out like Adele.

20:03.242 --> 20:05.119
What the fuck is a dell?

20:07.288 --> 20:08.748
She's a singer.

20:09.415 --> 20:12.210
Real popular.
My granddaughters listen to her.

20:12.293 --> 20:13.461
"Hello"?

20:14.587 --> 20:17.715
Hello, what? I'm standing right here.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.176
Never mind.

20:21.761 --> 20:24.347
- You hear about the Andersons?
- What happened?

20:24.430 --> 20:28.059
His kid get his hand caught
in the wood chipper again?

20:28.184 --> 20:30.770
Oh, yeah, but it was
the same hand as before

20:30.853 --> 20:32.980
so there's no harm, no foul.

20:35.274 --> 20:41.274
They finally sold out their ranch to
that big corporate outfit, Neumann's Hill.

20:41.405 --> 20:43.616
You gotta be kidding.

20:43.699 --> 20:46.953
No. They're buying out
independent ranchers all over the state.

20:48.412 --> 20:51.082
I never thought Anderson would sell.

20:51.165 --> 20:52.166
Beau...

20:53.084 --> 20:55.711
ranchin' can be real hard on a man.

20:56.712 --> 20:59.132
I guess he just needed a change.

21:00.133 --> 21:02.135
Everything's changing out here, Dale.

21:02.218 --> 21:04.512
[chuckles] Tell me about it.

21:04.595 --> 21:06.848
I got one of them new iPhones.

21:06.931 --> 21:09.559
I can't figure out
how in the hell to make a call.

21:09.684 --> 21:13.938
I sat on the thing the other day
and a woman started talking to me.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.484
Things used to be so much simpler.

21:19.527 --> 21:21.237
Ranchers didn't sell out...

21:22.238 --> 21:24.782
families stuck together...

21:24.866 --> 21:27.285
we only had three channels on the TV.

21:28.578 --> 21:32.915
Well... [grunts] change is coming
whether we want it or not.

21:32.999 --> 21:37.503
Take this, uh, Maggie deal, for example.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.549
I never thought I'd say this but let's
stick to talking about technology.

21:41.632 --> 21:42.800
Fair enough.

21:42.884 --> 21:45.178
I like to have more channels.

21:45.261 --> 21:48.681
- Did you ever watch that HGTV?
- Uh-uh.

21:48.764 --> 21:53.060
Them Property Brothers, they really
know how to transform a space.

21:55.021 --> 21:57.607
I watch CNN and The Weather Channel.

21:57.690 --> 22:01.694
Then I watch Fox News
to find out how the first two lied.

22:01.777 --> 22:04.906
[chuckles] What say we go
check on them heifers?

22:04.989 --> 22:06.073
Let's do.

22:06.991 --> 22:08.993
Thanks for coming out, Dale.
You're a good friend.

22:09.076 --> 22:10.077
What?

22:10.161 --> 22:12.496
I said you're a good friend, Dale.

22:12.580 --> 22:15.458
Oh, I heard you. I just wanted
to hear you say it twice.

22:26.469 --> 22:28.054
[doorbell rings]

22:33.643 --> 22:34.644
Colt!

22:36.145 --> 22:38.356
What are you, uh, doing here?

22:38.439 --> 22:39.982
What if Kenny had answered the door?

22:40.066 --> 22:41.067
No. I took care of that.

22:41.150 --> 22:43.945
I called the Marriott and asked
if Kenny Ballard was working.

22:44.028 --> 22:46.228
They said, "Yes." So I said,
"Wrong number" and hung up.

22:47.365 --> 22:50.409
So... [stammering] I just, um...

22:51.911 --> 22:52.912
We just need to talk.

22:52.995 --> 22:54.413
I know. I know.

22:54.497 --> 22:55.915
Yeah. I mean,
all I've been thinking about...

22:55.998 --> 22:57.208
Look, I'm staying with Kenny.

23:02.838 --> 23:04.465
- Shit.
- [exhales]

23:05.800 --> 23:06.926
Okay.

23:08.594 --> 23:09.845
And I'm sorry.

23:10.471 --> 23:14.016
Just... I've been doing
a lot of thinking, too.

23:15.434 --> 23:18.062
Kenny's a good guy.
I mean, he's the type of guy you marry.

23:20.481 --> 23:22.608
Yeah.

23:22.692 --> 23:23.943
Yeah, definitely.

23:24.026 --> 23:26.320
I love him. And he loves me.

23:28.239 --> 23:30.574
- [sighs]
- You deserve that. So...

23:31.867 --> 23:35.287
He's thoughtful, you know,
he plans these amazing date nights.

23:35.371 --> 23:36.414
Mmm-hmm.

23:36.497 --> 23:38.332
Last week, he traded in
a free night at the Marriott

23:38.416 --> 23:40.459
for a complimentary meal
at the Olive Garden.

23:41.711 --> 23:43.254
And I know they say it to everyone,

23:43.337 --> 23:45.137
but when we were there,
we really were family.

23:47.258 --> 23:49.010
[chuckling] I mean,
how do you compete with that?

23:49.093 --> 23:50.344
Endless breadsticks.

23:50.428 --> 23:51.929
[chuckles]

23:54.557 --> 23:55.641
I'm sorry, Colt.

23:55.725 --> 23:58.686
No... Don't... That, no. I...

23:58.769 --> 23:59.979
Look at me.

24:00.062 --> 24:02.481
I just want you to be happy.

24:03.399 --> 24:05.276
And this totally makes sense.

24:05.359 --> 24:08.571
Like, I can't compare
with a guy like Kenny. So...

24:10.823 --> 24:12.491
Thanks for being so understanding.

24:16.245 --> 24:18.664
You're making the right decision.

24:21.542 --> 24:23.002
Yeah.

24:23.753 --> 24:24.879
Yeah.

24:37.099 --> 24:38.601
[loud banging]

24:38.684 --> 24:39.810
[Rooster] Hello?

24:40.895 --> 24:42.396
- Dad?
- [banging continues]

24:43.481 --> 24:44.857
Colt, is that you?

24:46.484 --> 24:47.860
Mary?

24:47.943 --> 24:50.988
Are we finally doing that
fantasy where you kidnap me?

24:52.156 --> 24:53.532
[banging continues]

24:58.871 --> 25:01.082
Dad? What the hell are you doing?

25:02.291 --> 25:04.251
It's the middle of the night.
That can't wait until tomorrow?

25:04.335 --> 25:05.920
It's supposed to freeze tonight.

25:07.088 --> 25:08.172
[exhales sharply]

25:12.259 --> 25:13.260
Dad?

25:17.807 --> 25:20.601
[voice breaking]
Am I really that hard to live with?

25:23.312 --> 25:25.481
Come on, Dad,
you can't set me up like that.

25:28.442 --> 25:30.569
I did everything she asked...

25:31.570 --> 25:33.531
and it still wasn't enough.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.701
Yeah. You did plenty.

25:39.870 --> 25:41.872
Mom's the one who quit trying, you know?

25:41.956 --> 25:44.996
If she wanted to leave, there's nothing
you can do about that but let her go.

25:51.549 --> 25:52.967
[hammer thuds]

25:53.050 --> 25:54.385
[sniffles]

25:54.468 --> 25:55.928
[sighs]

26:02.476 --> 26:03.477
Hey.

26:05.896 --> 26:06.981
You gonna be okay?

26:07.982 --> 26:09.483
Yep.

26:09.567 --> 26:12.027
- [sniffles]
- Just so you know...

26:12.111 --> 26:16.240
I'm never gonna leave you.
Never have. I never will.

26:18.325 --> 26:20.703
That supposed to cheer me up? [Chuckles]

26:21.412 --> 26:22.788
Love you too, Daddy.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.500
[Beau exhales]

26:27.293 --> 26:29.295
