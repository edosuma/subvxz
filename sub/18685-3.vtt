00:00.000 --> 00:03.003
*

00:07.175 --> 00:08.976
Oh...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.579
Oh.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.414
Good morning, everybody.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.582
Shh!

00:16.617 --> 00:18.752
Who the hell is this clown?

00:19.787 --> 00:22.523
Hi. I'm Kai.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.092
He's my boyfriend.

00:24.125 --> 00:25.259
Who are you?

00:25.293 --> 00:26.260
Well, I'm...

00:26.294 --> 00:27.861
Mmm.
Mmm.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.098
(Chip groans)

00:30.131 --> 00:31.599
I'm Jimmy.

00:31.632 --> 00:34.468
My goodness.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.871
They are really
going for it, huh?

00:37.905 --> 00:40.308
*

00:41.975 --> 00:44.245
(bed frame banging)
(Sabrina moaning)

00:44.278 --> 00:45.946
SABRINA:
Yeah!

00:45.979 --> 00:47.248
(Sabrina and Kai laughing)

00:47.281 --> 00:50.351
Oh, my God,
are you really allowing this?

00:50.384 --> 00:51.519
What do you want me
to do about it?

00:51.552 --> 00:52.953
Something, it's disgusting.

00:52.986 --> 00:54.255
Just turn the TV up.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.756
Probably tire themselves
out pretty soon.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.057
Nah, I don't know, Mick.

00:57.091 --> 00:59.059
It kind of feels like
it's your department now.

00:59.093 --> 01:00.528
Are you giving me
parenting advice?

01:00.561 --> 01:02.196
Yeah, why are you even here?

01:02.230 --> 01:03.964
ALBA: Yeah, true, you
contribute nothing.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.799
Oh, what the hell are
you guys talking about?

01:05.833 --> 01:06.967
I'm the father figure.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.636
Do you like my turtle?

01:08.669 --> 01:10.104
Uh...

01:10.138 --> 01:11.972
no, not really.

01:12.005 --> 01:13.974
Good job, Dad.

01:14.007 --> 01:15.209
Well, I'm not gonna
lie to the kid.

01:15.243 --> 01:16.310
(furniture crashing upstairs)

01:16.344 --> 01:18.146
Oh, there we go.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.913
Problem solved.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.549
(bed frame banging)
Oh...

01:21.582 --> 01:24.918
Oh, my God!
(Mickey and Ben yelling)

01:24.952 --> 01:26.654
(door opens)

01:26.687 --> 01:28.389
Knock, knock. Can I come in?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.391
Mm-hmm. You could also
actually knock.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.393
Yeah. How's it going?

01:32.426 --> 01:33.761
Everything good?
Yep.

01:33.794 --> 01:34.828
Just chillin'.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.029
Yeah, yeah.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.233
So, Kai, huh?

01:39.267 --> 01:40.334
He seems cool.
Yeah.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.769
What's his deal?
Is he like a...

01:41.802 --> 01:43.937
a fireman or a model
or something?
No.

01:43.971 --> 01:45.673
No, he builds furniture
out of found wood.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.107
(laughing):
Found wood.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.677
Found wood's a thing. Oh.

01:50.811 --> 01:54.748
So, I guess you guys
are having sex, huh?

01:54.782 --> 01:56.016
Oh, God, are we
having the talk?

01:56.049 --> 01:57.318
No, I don't want to
have the talk, at all.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.752
Listen, I just wanted
to let you know that

01:58.786 --> 02:01.088
I totally get it and

02:01.121 --> 02:02.190
you picked a good one,

02:02.223 --> 02:04.024
that guy is a hall
of fame piece of ass.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.125
(chuckling)
Oh, man,

02:05.159 --> 02:07.328
I'd let him do
things to me...

02:07.361 --> 02:08.496
Please stop!
Just stop it.

02:08.529 --> 02:09.863
All right, the point is, uh,

02:09.897 --> 02:11.599
you're a woman with
needs and I get it,

02:11.632 --> 02:14.602
so as long as you're
using condoms, I'm cool.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.603
We're not.

02:15.636 --> 02:17.371
Oh, okay. Well, that's cool.

02:17.405 --> 02:18.439
Your body, your choice.

02:18.472 --> 02:20.040
I am more of a pill person
myself.

02:20.073 --> 02:22.343
Do you have any idea how
poisonous that stuff is?

02:22.376 --> 02:24.778
How is birth control poison,
Sabrina?

02:24.812 --> 02:27.215
It destroys your body
and causes crazy mood swings.

02:27.248 --> 02:28.216
So do babies!

02:28.249 --> 02:29.983
Why do you all of a sudden
care what...

02:30.017 --> 02:32.386
Oh...

02:32.420 --> 02:33.387
I get it.
(laughs)

02:33.421 --> 02:34.355
Get what?

02:34.388 --> 02:35.623
You're jealous.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.457
I'm jealous?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.625
Yeah.
What, of you?

02:37.658 --> 02:39.360
Why would I be jealous of you?

02:39.393 --> 02:42.062
Maybe because I have a beautiful
hunk of beef and you don't.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.831
I got beef.
Who, Jimmy?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.233
That packaged lunch meat?

02:45.266 --> 02:47.635
I'm over here feasting
on filet mignon.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.403
All right, you know what?
I don't want to have

02:49.437 --> 02:50.571
this conversation. I just
don't want you to get

02:50.604 --> 02:52.473
pregnant,
so why don't you just take

02:52.506 --> 02:55.643
some of my pills, until you go
fill a prescription of your own.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.379
(chuckling): You keep your
birth control in a plastic bag?

02:58.412 --> 02:59.647
Well, I buy it in bulk online.

02:59.680 --> 03:01.014
I find it more cost effective.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.082
I don't want them, okay?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.984
Why are you so resistant
to the pill?

03:04.017 --> 03:05.419
It's a modern miracle!

03:05.453 --> 03:07.421
The pill revolutionized
everything for women.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.822
We were able to
join the workforce.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.391
It allowed us to...
You never worked a day

03:10.424 --> 03:11.392
in your life.
(door opening)

03:11.425 --> 03:12.393
But I could if I wanted to,

03:12.426 --> 03:13.927
thanks to this magic
little pill.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.096
Those pills are magic?

03:16.129 --> 03:18.031
Oh, here we go.
Ben, let me ask you something.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.100
If there was a pill that
gave you the freedom

03:20.133 --> 03:21.835
to be anything
in the whole world,

03:21.869 --> 03:23.571
would you take it?
Definitely.

03:23.604 --> 03:26.274
There you go. This kid gets it
and he's, like, three.

03:26.307 --> 03:28.108
Great, then he can take 'em.
How 'bout that?

03:28.141 --> 03:30.644
Okay, come back here.

03:31.279 --> 03:32.646
Come on, Sabrina.

03:33.714 --> 03:34.682
What do you care
what I do with my body?

03:34.715 --> 03:35.749
You're not my mom.

03:35.783 --> 03:36.884
Honey, as far as I'm concerned,

03:36.917 --> 03:38.519
as long as I'm here,
I have two jobs:

03:38.552 --> 03:40.688
make sure nobody dies
or winds up pregnant.

03:40.721 --> 03:41.855
No deaths, no births.

03:41.889 --> 03:43.291
Is what you're doing even legal?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.792
You're 17!

03:44.825 --> 03:45.959
What is he, like 30?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.060
Actually, the age of consent

03:47.094 --> 03:48.696
in Connecticut is 16.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.063
What?

03:51.265 --> 03:53.200
It's cool to have sex
with a 16-year-old

03:53.233 --> 03:54.502
in the state of Connecticut.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
Well, not cool like "awesome."

03:57.471 --> 03:59.973
Cool like "acceptable."

04:00.007 --> 04:01.609
Gross, how do
you know that?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.076
I know what I know.

04:03.110 --> 04:04.978
12 in Oaxaca.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.246
MICKEY: Pull your head
out of your ass!

04:06.280 --> 04:07.648
Come on, this is
the kind of mistake

04:07.681 --> 04:08.882
that could ruin your life.

04:08.916 --> 04:10.818
I'm not gonna get pregnant.
(Chip chuckles)

04:10.851 --> 04:12.753
God, I'm so stoked
I'm not a girl.

04:12.786 --> 04:14.588
Babies friggin' suck.
Hey,

04:14.622 --> 04:15.989
it's a two-way street, pal.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.725
Women have trapped men
since the dawn of time

04:17.758 --> 04:19.993
by getting "accidentally"
knocked up.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.663
And you, my friend,
are a prime target.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.898
If I were a chick,
I would take you down.

04:24.932 --> 04:26.467
(groans)

04:26.500 --> 04:27.835
Hey, babe.

04:27.868 --> 04:30.170
Hey.

04:31.772 --> 04:35.075
(both moaning)

04:35.108 --> 04:37.911
(moaning continues)

04:37.945 --> 04:39.613
Um?

04:39.647 --> 04:42.282
Jimmy, can I have a word with
you in the bedroom for a second?

04:42.316 --> 04:44.452
Why?
(moaning continues)

04:44.485 --> 04:45.919
Oh. Oh, yeah.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.187
Yeah, yeah, yep.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.129
Hey, guys.

04:56.163 --> 04:58.499
Kai, can you give us
a little privacy, please?

04:58.532 --> 05:00.368
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Thanks.

05:00.401 --> 05:01.769
Babe, do you
need anything?

05:01.802 --> 05:02.870
I'm fine.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.104
Oh, yeah, you are.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.340
Okay. Scooch over.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.208
Here we go.
Whoopsie daisy.
Um...

05:08.241 --> 05:09.677
So, listen,

05:09.710 --> 05:11.545
I was thinking about
our conversation yesterday

05:11.579 --> 05:13.681
and I feel like I came across
kind of naggy.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.215
And I'm really sorry
about that.

05:15.248 --> 05:17.217
Because I get it,
condoms suck.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.852
Remember how I felt about
this conversation before?

05:18.886 --> 05:20.388
Mm-hmm.
Nothing's changed.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.389
All right, well,
just hear me out, okay?

05:21.422 --> 05:22.723
I went down to the free clinic

05:22.756 --> 05:24.492
and I took full advantage
of the "free" part for you.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.727
Turns out, you kids have
all sorts of options these days.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.028
What?
I mean,
are you kidding me?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.062
Look at this.

05:29.096 --> 05:29.963
For instance,

05:29.997 --> 05:31.331
what's this little guy?

05:31.365 --> 05:33.701
(humming)
Cute little silver package.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.736
A ring!

05:35.769 --> 05:37.037
It's like a little
piece of calamari.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.238
That's cool.

05:38.271 --> 05:39.239
I don't know what
you're supposed--

05:39.272 --> 05:41.375
does this go around the...

05:41.409 --> 05:43.377
Oh, no, no. Nope,
you squish it,

05:43.411 --> 05:44.878
and you actually
stick it up your...

05:44.912 --> 05:46.179
(popping noise)
and you are, uh--

05:46.213 --> 05:47.347
you're open for business.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.982
Oh, yeah? Okay, cool, well,

05:49.016 --> 05:51.084
uh, it has the exact same
hormones as the pill

05:51.118 --> 05:53.721
and it causes blood clots.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.088
Okay, try not to be
a pain in the ass,

05:55.122 --> 05:56.089
we have a lot more here.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.758
Now, what is this gizmo?

05:57.791 --> 05:58.892
That's an IUD.

05:58.926 --> 06:00.694
(groaning):
Boy, it's off-putting.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.829
Very long.
Yeah.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.664
Oh, but you know
what I see here?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.066
No chemicals, no hormones.

06:06.099 --> 06:07.100
Looks like we've

06:07.134 --> 06:08.769
got a winner!
Nope.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.770
Open wide.
Don't even...

06:09.803 --> 06:11.271
Yeah, here comes
the airplane.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.273
Come on.
(imitating airplane)
I'm gonna shove it all--

06:13.306 --> 06:14.742
I'm just kidding.
I don't want it!

06:14.775 --> 06:16.544
I won't, you got pants on.
Oh, my God.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.178
That thing is filled
with copper.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.346
Come on, do you have
any other toxins

06:19.379 --> 06:20.448
you want to fill me up with?

06:20.481 --> 06:22.450
Oh, my God, you are
the dumbest smart person

06:22.483 --> 06:23.517
I have ever met in my life.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.085
Fine, you don't want
to use condoms,

06:25.118 --> 06:26.554
I guess I'll have
to be the condom.

06:26.587 --> 06:27.621
Gross, what does that even mean?

06:27.655 --> 06:29.289
It means I will see to it
that you and Kai

06:29.322 --> 06:30.791
never have unprotected sex.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.460
How?
I don't have a job

06:32.493 --> 06:33.927
or any hobbies;
I'll figure something out.

06:33.961 --> 06:34.762
CHIP:
Hey, Mickey.

06:34.795 --> 06:35.863
I need your signature.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.197
(groaning):
Yeah,

06:37.230 --> 06:38.298
I'm not big on paper trails.

06:38.331 --> 06:39.299
What's it for?

06:39.332 --> 06:40.300
Well, I thought about
what Jimmy said

06:40.333 --> 06:42.503
and I'm gonna get a vasectomy.

06:46.474 --> 06:49.309
A vasectomy? What the hell
are you talking about?

06:49.342 --> 06:50.377
Jimmy's right, I got

06:50.410 --> 06:52.312
a big-ass target on my back.
Jimmy!

06:52.345 --> 06:53.814
Think about it: I'm rich,

06:53.847 --> 06:56.216
I'm smart, I look like
a friggin' movie star,

06:56.249 --> 06:57.485
I'm kind,

06:57.518 --> 06:58.886
and I'd make a great dad.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.253
It's only a matter of time

07:00.287 --> 07:01.388
until some gold-digging whore

07:01.421 --> 07:02.623
lures me into her honey trap.

07:02.656 --> 07:04.492
JIMMY: What's up?
Chip here

07:04.525 --> 07:05.959
is thinking about
getting a vasectomy.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.661
Oh, right on. You want me
to drive him or something?

07:07.695 --> 07:09.730
No, I don't, because
he's not getting one.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.098
Hey, this is my body.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.233
I should be able to do whatever
the hell I want with it!

07:13.266 --> 07:15.503
He's got a point.
Nah, don't you--
don't start.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.838
He's not getting his balls
chopped off, Jimmy, okay?

07:17.871 --> 07:19.072
Okay, that's not how it works.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.407
It's actually a pretty simple
procedure.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.142
They clamp it, snip it, seal it.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.344
I've had it done a couple times
and reversed, so...

07:24.377 --> 07:26.113
Okay, he hasn't even
kissed a girl yet.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.649
I've kissed girls, okay?
I kiss-I kiss mad girls!

07:28.682 --> 07:29.617
All right, prove it.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.684
Kiss your hand, show me how

07:30.718 --> 07:31.985
you kiss all these girls.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.121
Okay...

07:34.154 --> 07:35.723
(sighs)

07:37.390 --> 07:38.692
(moaning)

07:43.897 --> 07:47.034
(laughing)

07:47.067 --> 07:49.770
Stop laughing,
it's not funny!

07:49.803 --> 07:51.471
I'm sorry.
What's going on?

07:51.505 --> 07:52.640
Oh, nothing,

07:52.673 --> 07:54.141
we're just, um,
making fun of Chip

07:54.174 --> 07:55.342
'cause he's never kissed a girl.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.210
Ah, don't sweat
it, little man.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.547
I didn't have my first kiss
till the third grade.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.548
Well, I'm 13.

08:00.581 --> 08:02.315
Hmm. Well,

08:02.349 --> 08:03.483
there's nothing to it.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.285
All you got to do is
just close your eyes,

08:05.318 --> 08:07.821
just let the wave
wash over you.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.127
No, no, okay,
all right, all right,

08:14.161 --> 08:16.396
hold on. H-Hey.
Hang on a second. Wait!

08:16.429 --> 08:18.131
Just stop. Stop! Stop it!

08:18.165 --> 08:19.399
I mean...
Stop!

08:19.432 --> 08:22.636
Get out. Good, good.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.137
Good, really good.

08:24.171 --> 08:28.341
Healthy. Healthy as a horse.
(laughing)

08:29.843 --> 08:31.144
Jimmy, a word.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.747
What? Oh.

08:33.781 --> 08:36.316
* Bounce, come on,
bounce, bounce *

08:36.349 --> 08:39.052
* Come on, bounce... *

08:39.086 --> 08:41.388
Oh, my God!

08:41.421 --> 08:42.890
* 'Cause I'm the king
of the castle *

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
* Na, na, na *
* Turn me on, turn me loose

08:44.858 --> 08:45.893
* Come on, come on *

08:45.926 --> 08:46.994
* Try to hit it,
it's a hassle *

08:47.027 --> 08:47.995
* Come get some of this...

08:48.028 --> 08:49.930
(gasps, groans)

08:49.963 --> 08:51.498
* Play me like Nintendo,
never, ever let go *

08:51.531 --> 08:54.001
* Keep it so loud, you'll be
hittin' the crescendo *

08:54.034 --> 08:55.603
* Do Re Mi Fa Sol La Ti Do *

08:55.636 --> 08:57.337
* Come, baby, come

08:57.370 --> 08:58.772
* Baby, baby, come, come

08:58.806 --> 09:00.774
* Come, baby, come,
baby, baby, come, come *

09:00.808 --> 09:01.709
* When you got
to give me lovin' *

09:01.742 --> 09:02.910
* And you got to give me some

09:02.943 --> 09:03.911
* You got to give me lovin' *

09:03.944 --> 09:04.912
* And you got to give me some *

09:04.945 --> 09:06.747
(Sabrina yelling)

09:06.780 --> 09:08.616
What are you doing?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.618
(coughing):
Oh, come on.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.452
* Then you got to give me some

09:12.485 --> 09:14.454
* You got to give me lovin',
then you got to give me some *

09:14.487 --> 09:17.224
* Come on, come on *

09:17.257 --> 09:19.793
* Come on,
come on *

09:19.827 --> 09:21.094
* Come on, come on *

09:21.128 --> 09:22.896
* Come on,
come on... *

09:22.930 --> 09:24.231
Oh!

09:24.264 --> 09:26.099
(laughing)

09:27.500 --> 09:30.503
(whimpering)

09:31.939 --> 09:33.306
* Well, I can hear the
* Ring, ring, ring *

09:33.340 --> 09:34.541
* The telephone goes ring
(whirring)

09:34.574 --> 09:35.643
* Hello, hello *

09:35.676 --> 09:37.477
* But we're still
gettin' busy. *

09:37.510 --> 09:39.446
Yeah! There we go.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.281
Ooh, stinks in here.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.482
Get a little air flow going.

09:42.515 --> 09:43.751
What are you, insane?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.385
You have nothing better
to do than to stalk me?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.487
You guys just say the word.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.823
Just give 'em to me,
we'll try 'em, you maniac.

09:49.857 --> 09:51.759
Now we're talking.

09:51.792 --> 09:52.893
(sighing)
(whirring)

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
You kids go nuts.
(groaning)

09:55.996 --> 09:58.098
(yells)

09:58.131 --> 10:00.500
Whoa...

10:00.533 --> 10:02.402
What is the problem, slugger?

10:02.435 --> 10:05.072
All the girls at my
school are stupid trolls!

10:05.105 --> 10:07.841
Oh, well, you were smart
to come to me.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.309
I didn't, you walked
into my room.

10:09.342 --> 10:10.978
Yeah, either way.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.080
Tell me about
these trolls, pal.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.848
(sighs)
They're...

10:14.882 --> 10:17.584
they're not trolls, okay,
they just...

10:17.617 --> 10:20.320
they won't...
(sighs)

10:20.353 --> 10:21.789
Okay, if I tell you,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.423
you have to promise
not to tell anybody.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.591
Yeah, of course.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.694
Mickey's right, I never...

10:26.727 --> 10:28.996
kissed a girl, ever.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.263
Uh-huh.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.498
I tried to do it like Kai,

10:31.531 --> 10:34.001
but they all treated me
like I had friggin' AIDS.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.269
Okay, that's ignorant
and insensitive,

10:36.303 --> 10:38.806
but I get how it feels
to be rejected.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.440
Trust me, uh...

10:40.473 --> 10:42.275
All right, and Kai,

10:42.309 --> 10:45.312
he's so good looking, it's--

10:45.345 --> 10:47.080
I wouldn't mind taking
a run at him myself.

10:48.348 --> 10:50.350
And he is really giving
your aunt and I

10:50.383 --> 10:51.719
a jump-start in the bedroom.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.120
Oh, gross, dude.
Know your audience.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.222
I'm sorry. Look,
all I'm saying is

10:55.255 --> 10:57.057
you got to be
yourself, okay.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.192
Forget Kai and his looks.

10:59.226 --> 11:01.294
You've got things that
he doesn't have, right?

11:01.328 --> 11:03.563
You got to play to those,
play to your strengths.

11:03.596 --> 11:05.532
Right, play to my strengths.

11:05.565 --> 11:07.701
Thank you, Jimmy.
Yeah.

11:07.735 --> 11:09.737
(bed frame banging upstairs)

11:09.770 --> 11:12.639
Ugh. What the heck is
going on up there?

11:12.672 --> 11:18.345
Your sister's getting fu...
rniture... delivered.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.313
Huh?
Pretty cool drawing.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.915
No, it's not.
It's terrible.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.718
And how am I supposed
to make anything good

11:24.752 --> 11:27.420
when you won't stop
breathing down my neck?!

11:27.454 --> 11:31.258
Whoa, Benny, what is
going on with you, bud?

11:31.291 --> 11:34.094
You're so moody these days.

11:34.127 --> 11:38.431
Ms. Mickey? Look, I found
these in Sabrina's trash.

11:38.465 --> 11:40.167
Are you serious?

11:40.200 --> 11:41.735
You have to promise me
you will not let her

11:41.769 --> 11:43.771
get pregnant, okay--
prométame.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.773
I prometa. Okay?

11:45.806 --> 11:48.075
I already raised
Sabrina, Chip, and Ben.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.410
I cannot do another, not with
all the crying and the-

11:50.443 --> 11:52.112
and the no sleeping
and the diapers.
I get it. Hey, hey, yes...

11:52.145 --> 11:54.447
There are just
so many diapers.
I understand, okay.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.050
No, no, no,
you don't understand.

11:57.084 --> 11:58.786
I breastfed all
three of them.

11:58.819 --> 12:01.088
My nipples are like
old chewing gum.

12:01.121 --> 12:04.291
No, no, no, but come on,
good God, that's enough.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.725
I'll figure it out, okay.

12:05.759 --> 12:07.928
I don't want to hear about
your nipples anymore.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.363
Are we cool on that?
Yeah, we're good.
We're good.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.433
Okay, good.
But we got to keep
her from seeing him.

12:13.466 --> 12:15.302
No, that's the classic thing.
If we forbid her to see him,

12:15.335 --> 12:16.804
she's just going
to want him more.

12:16.837 --> 12:19.406
We got to make her
break up with him.

12:19.439 --> 12:22.309
(gasps) Oh!
What?

12:22.342 --> 12:24.544
I'm going to bang
his beautiful brains out.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.747
Oh... yeah.
Oh... yeah.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.986
Mickey, I got
a bad feeling about this.

12:33.020 --> 12:34.654
Sabrina is going to
do the murder to you

12:34.687 --> 12:36.123
if you sleep with Kai.

12:36.156 --> 12:37.958
Yeah, well, she'll
get over it.

12:37.991 --> 12:41.661
I think it should be me who
carries out this despicable act.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.764
Oh, Alba, that is
very generous of you,

12:44.798 --> 12:46.299
but not necessary.

12:46.333 --> 12:48.001
You already do so much
for this family.

12:48.035 --> 12:51.738
Oh, well, I really
don't do a lot,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.773
and I've been slacking off.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.509
Yeah, it's okay.
I-I do this.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.345
Yeah, super thoughtful,
but you know what?

12:58.378 --> 12:59.847
Here's the thing.

12:59.880 --> 13:02.015
Kai's a thoroughbred, right?
And we really need

13:02.049 --> 13:04.517
an experienced jockey
riding that horse.

13:04.551 --> 13:05.853
Yeah, but if I could
just take a...

13:05.886 --> 13:08.788
Back off, Alba, okay?
I'm doing my plan.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.824
KAI (calling out):
Hello? Ma'am?

13:10.858 --> 13:12.692
Just be grateful
you get to listen.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.630
Hello?
Oh, hey, you.

13:17.664 --> 13:18.698
Hey. I got your message.

13:18.731 --> 13:19.699
There's something wrong
with your bed?

13:19.732 --> 13:21.334
Jumping right into it, huh?

13:21.368 --> 13:23.203
I like that.
Want to have a drink first?

13:23.236 --> 13:26.706
Oh, no, I'm okay. You know,
booze and power tools.

13:26.739 --> 13:28.876
All right, I'll take yours.

13:28.909 --> 13:29.910
Oh.

13:33.413 --> 13:37.384
So, um, what seems to be
the problem over here?

13:37.417 --> 13:39.887
Oh, man, she's creaking
like a barn door.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.721
Oh, yeah?
Yep.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.057
Hmm, well, I guess I could
tighten a few screws,

13:44.091 --> 13:46.726
but it looks good to me.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.295
It looks good to me, too.

13:48.328 --> 13:52.665
Yeah, okay. Um, let's see.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.869
Yeah, you know, I'm still not
really hearing anything.

13:55.903 --> 13:57.404
You're not
hearing it? Yeah.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.006
Oh, I think I know
what the problem is.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.575
Normally I'm, huh, on top of it

14:02.609 --> 14:04.711
when I'm hearing the noises,
you know what I mean?

14:04.744 --> 14:07.014
It's, kind of, like...
(grunting)

14:07.047 --> 14:10.517
squeak... squeak...
squeak, squeak.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.751
You hearing it at all?

14:11.784 --> 14:13.921
Yeah, you know,
I'm not hearing it.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.756
Oh, okay. Well, then I guess
let's just start over.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.425
We don't have to overthink it.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.593
Let's go under the bed and we'll
figure out sort of a...
N-No.

14:20.627 --> 14:23.363
I just want to get
out of this here.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.765
You know what, maybe
I should... okay.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.567
Well, hold on.
Hang on a second.
Okay.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.269
I think if we... you just
gave me a second, we could...

14:29.302 --> 14:30.537
Oh!

14:30.570 --> 14:32.272
My goodness, what a launch.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.575
Are you-are you leaving?
Leave. Get out of here.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.377
Get out of my room.
Get out of my room

14:37.410 --> 14:39.446
and do not come back.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.348
I could've
closed the deal.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.283
Not now, Alba, okay?
Not now.

14:43.316 --> 14:46.453
Oh, that bitch, if she wants
to get pregnant, fine, fine.

14:46.486 --> 14:48.922
We're gonna help her
get pregnant.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.323
Hmm?

14:57.164 --> 14:59.032
Hey, Steffi.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.300
Hey, Chip.

15:00.333 --> 15:03.370
So, uh, did you take
that math test?

15:03.403 --> 15:05.238
Oh, my God,
it was so hard.

15:05.272 --> 15:07.740
Right? It's like,
are we in algebra or,

15:07.774 --> 15:10.777
like, the friggin'
space program?

15:10.810 --> 15:13.080
Like, "Earth to algebra,
nobody likes you."

15:13.113 --> 15:17.150
So cool, cool... chill.

15:17.184 --> 15:19.987
Um, well, I just, like,
think you're really,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.788
really pretty and,
like, super cool,

15:21.821 --> 15:23.256
and I like hanging out
with you and stuff.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.825
And, like, you're super
friggin' chill and, like,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.060
all that good stuff.

15:27.094 --> 15:28.328
Chip, you don't have
to be so nervous.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.496
You can just ask.

15:29.529 --> 15:32.465
Okay. Whew.

15:32.499 --> 15:35.235
Well, I was just
wondering if...

15:35.268 --> 15:39.139
I-I could pay you $500
to make out with me?
What?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.008
Um, you're better
than that. $1,000.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.642
Oh!
You jerk.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.517
(Sabrina retching)

15:50.550 --> 15:54.988
Damn, Alba, how much ipecac
did you put in that smoothie?

15:55.022 --> 15:56.256
I'm just trying to
fake morning sickness,

15:56.289 --> 15:57.524
not blow her guts out.

15:57.557 --> 16:00.093
I'm sorry I'm not the expert
drugger like you.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.761
No, you're not. You guys are
lucky to have me here.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.764
Look what I got online,
a bunch of fake pregnancy tests.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.200
I replaced them with all
the ones under Poodle's sink.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.535
You hand a guy
something like this,

16:08.568 --> 16:10.970
he just starts throwing cash
at you, no questions asked.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.373
I like to call it
the $600 shuffle.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.608
Yeah, now I just
feel depressed.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.809
What are you two doing?

16:16.843 --> 16:18.678
Oh, us? Nothing.
We're... we're just,

16:18.711 --> 16:20.380
you know,
we're hanging out.
Yeah.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.349
No, you're acting weird.

16:22.382 --> 16:23.650
No, we are not.

16:23.683 --> 16:25.385
We are acting as
regular as can be.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.386
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.388
Yes, you are,
and I know why.

16:28.421 --> 16:31.124
You don't want to tell me
that you hate my drawing.

16:31.158 --> 16:33.493
You think I don't have
control of the marker,

16:33.526 --> 16:35.828
and this whole art thing
is a waste of my time.

16:35.862 --> 16:38.698
Well, you don't have to tell me
because I already know.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.302
Whoa, what a dick.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.836
What's wrong with him?

16:43.870 --> 16:45.172
I don't know.
What's wrong with you?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.906
You look horrible.
Oh, yeah.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.575
Well, I've been sick all day.
I don't know.

16:48.608 --> 16:51.144
I think I got to stop drinking
on school nights, you know?

16:51.178 --> 16:55.082
Or maybe you have
a baby inside you.
Oh, okay.

16:55.115 --> 16:57.184
Well, that's not possible

16:57.217 --> 16:58.485
'cause she's using
condoms, right?

16:58.518 --> 17:00.387
Right. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, I'm just saying,

17:00.420 --> 17:02.322
maybe you want to take
one of the pregnancy tests

17:02.355 --> 17:04.591
in Poodle's bathroom, you know,
just to be sure.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.926
She's got a good point.
It couldn't hurt.

17:06.959 --> 17:08.428
Well, I-I mean, I don't...

17:08.461 --> 17:10.897
(gagging)

17:10.930 --> 17:12.099
Oh, uh-oh.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.266
Oh, no.
Get it out.

17:13.300 --> 17:16.369
Oh, no, no. Eh.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.337
(door slams)

17:17.370 --> 17:18.938
She's a tiny person.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.773
Just a little drip,
you know what I mean?
(Sabrina retching)

17:20.807 --> 17:23.009
(groaning)

17:23.042 --> 17:26.446
Hey, buddy,
I'm glad you called.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.082
I called Mickey.
Yeah, well, I'm here.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.584
What's the problem?
You're the problem.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.886
I-I did what you said.
I played to my strengths,

17:33.920 --> 17:36.756
and Steffi booted
my nuts into my throat.

17:36.789 --> 17:39.959
Yeah. Well, don't worry,
they'll drop back down.

17:39.992 --> 17:42.061
I frigging hate girls.
Hey, come on.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.464
You're a young man.
This is just beginning.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.099
All right?
And to tell you the truth,

17:46.133 --> 17:49.802
I miss the days girls were
blasting me in the junk.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.471
Are you the father?

17:51.504 --> 17:55.608
Uh... I am today.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.777
Well, his scans
look okay.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.379
Hopefully the pain
and swelling will subside

17:59.412 --> 18:01.281
in the next few days,
but if not,

18:01.314 --> 18:03.916
that could mean something more
serious, maybe even infertility.

18:03.950 --> 18:05.718
What does-what does that mean?

18:05.752 --> 18:08.321
Well, his...
I...

18:08.355 --> 18:10.557
I think it means
you got your wish.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.992
Congrats on your first
vasectomy.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.026
Oh...

18:17.464 --> 18:19.599
And the more that I think about
it, it's not the worst thing

18:19.632 --> 18:21.934
I can't have kids--
I can always adopt.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.270
I would not wish
that on any

18:23.303 --> 18:24.637
abandoned child
in the world.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.673
Psst, Mickey.
She's coming.

18:26.706 --> 18:27.907
Yeah?
She's coming,
she's coming.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.642
Okay, okay. Shh.
Keep a straight face, okay.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.077
All right, play it cool.
We're going to make her look

18:31.110 --> 18:32.512
like a real scumbag.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.981
She is going to freak.
Yeah.

18:35.014 --> 18:37.850
Hi, everybody.
Hey.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.520
Uh, so, Kai and I,
we have some news.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.121
What? What is this news?
I don't know what it could be.

18:42.155 --> 18:44.123
Okay, what is
the news?

18:44.157 --> 18:46.926
I don't really know how to
say this, so I'm just gonna...

18:46.959 --> 18:49.529
put it out there.
MICKEY: Go for it.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.497
I'm pregnant.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.664
(gasps)

18:51.698 --> 18:53.533
There we go.
The first dilution

18:53.566 --> 18:54.967
of the Pemberton
bloodline.

18:55.001 --> 18:56.336
Well, this is shocking.

18:56.369 --> 18:58.037
I had zero ideas
about this.

18:58.070 --> 19:00.507
Who would ever know this
to be true? Shame, shame.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.176
As you can see,
we are shocked, okay,

19:03.210 --> 19:05.612
and you are a moron,
Sabrina.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.947
How could you do this? I told
you this was going to happen.

19:07.980 --> 19:12.352
You were right.
I'm a big stupid idiot.

19:12.385 --> 19:14.354
My whole life is ruined.

19:14.387 --> 19:16.055
(Sabrina sobbing)

19:16.088 --> 19:17.557
What did you do to our
little girl, you son of...?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.826
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Stop it. No, no, no.

19:19.859 --> 19:22.362
It's a... Sorry.
You guys, I'm sorry.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.063
This is a big
misunderstanding.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.534
Ma'am, ma'am, with all
due respect, I got this.

19:27.567 --> 19:30.837
Babe, babe, look at me, okay.
Listen to me, I love you.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.405
And we're gonna
have a baby.

19:32.439 --> 19:35.375
Yeah, well, that's the thing...
Ma'am!

19:35.408 --> 19:37.577
How cool is that? Hmm?

19:37.610 --> 19:41.581
I get to build him a crib
and a rocking horse,

19:41.614 --> 19:43.450
and a whole friggin' house
to put it all in.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.387
I mean...

19:47.420 --> 19:50.156
you know what?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.524
Screw it.

19:51.558 --> 19:55.262
What the hell is happening?
Ma'am!

19:55.295 --> 19:56.763
Sabrina Pemberton,

19:56.796 --> 19:59.065
I love you.
Mm...

19:59.098 --> 20:00.066
Will you marry me, baby?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.535
Yes, I will marry you.

20:02.569 --> 20:04.737
Okay, great. Yeah, that's
the thing I was gonna say

20:04.771 --> 20:06.573
is that she's not pregnant.

20:06.606 --> 20:07.940
That's good.
What?

20:07.974 --> 20:09.108
She's not pregnant.
You're not pregnant.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.944
What do you mean?
Alba and I...

20:11.978 --> 20:13.246
Well...

20:13.280 --> 20:17.417
We wanted to teach you
a lesson, you know? So we...

20:17.450 --> 20:21.087
So I-I hope you learned.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.423
I can't... It's gone
off the rails a bit.

20:23.456 --> 20:24.424
I'm not really sure...

20:24.457 --> 20:28.961
Okay. Well, thank you.

20:28.995 --> 20:32.098
Yes, you're welcome.

20:32.131 --> 20:34.100
Wait, for what?

20:34.133 --> 20:35.535
Well, if you didn't do that,
I never would've found out

20:35.568 --> 20:38.471
what an amazing man Kai is.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.872
Oh, my God, do you still
want to marry me?

20:39.906 --> 20:41.541
What?
More than anything.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.276
No.
No baby, fake baby.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.777
Yeah, that's
the same thing, though.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.078
You hear that?
It's kind of the same thing.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.947
* Sabrina's getting married

20:47.980 --> 20:51.217
Wait...

20:51.250 --> 20:55.121
Sabrina's getting married?

20:55.154 --> 20:56.589
Okay, what the hell's
going on with this one?

20:56.623 --> 20:59.125
Huh? I'm happy

20:59.158 --> 21:02.295
and sad...

21:02.329 --> 21:04.096
and mad.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.466
Come on, Ben, what's
going on with you, buddy?

21:06.499 --> 21:09.268
I'm just a big, fat,
no-talent loser.

21:09.302 --> 21:12.472
Even your magic pills
couldn't help.

21:12.505 --> 21:15.308
What magic pills?
The ones in your purse.

21:15.342 --> 21:18.945
I filled it with other pills
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

21:18.978 --> 21:21.348
Are you talking about
my birth control?
Mm-mm.

21:21.381 --> 21:25.485
That's not good, because Jimmy
and I have been... a lot.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.854
Uh...
I'm gonna be a dad.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.022
No, no, no.
I'm gonna be a da...

21:31.558 --> 21:33.025
MICKEY: Shove it all...
I'm just kidding.

21:33.059 --> 21:35.027
