WEBVTT

02:04.917 --> 02:05.751
Yes!

02:29.137 --> 02:30.013
Hey, Weasel!

02:31.180 --> 02:32.765
Take me for a ride?

02:34.099 --> 02:36.851
Mr Manx, I caught a girl.
Come and see!

02:37.767 --> 02:40.227
Steve said he's gonna die out here.

03:18.205 --> 03:19.247
Maggie...

03:22.165 --> 03:23.374
Come on.

03:24.125 --> 03:25.250
Shit!

03:28.085 --> 03:30.378
Hey, stop!

03:46.511 --> 03:48.596
Dude, are you OK?

03:49.054 --> 03:50.763
You been in some sort of accident?

03:50.889 --> 03:53.765
- Please, I need a phone.
- There's no reception out here.

03:54.390 --> 03:55.850
But there's a man...

03:55.975 --> 03:58.059
He's got my boyfriend
and a little boy.

04:00.269 --> 04:02.936
He trapped me at his house
and he set it on fire.

04:04.605 --> 04:05.479
Fire!

04:06.938 --> 04:08.231
Jesus!

04:09.857 --> 04:12.233
- Alright. Come on.
- Thank you.

04:19.321 --> 04:20.154
Hold on.

05:12.181 --> 05:14.223
Hey. Hey...

05:15.016 --> 05:17.601
We're gonna go inside,
we're gonna use the phone,

05:17.726 --> 05:19.810
and we're gonna bring
the law down here, OK?

05:19.935 --> 05:22.102
- Thank you.
- You can head up the steps.

05:22.227 --> 05:23.604
I'm gonna get the door.

05:24.228 --> 05:25.480
How old is he, now?

05:25.605 --> 05:27.814
Old enough to eat me
out of house and home.

05:28.898 --> 05:30.274
Excuse me.

05:30.398 --> 05:33.484
- You're out of Chef Boyardee.
- Stock coming in tomorrow.

05:33.609 --> 05:35.318
Hey, you two listen to me.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.861
We need to use your phone.
This girl's lucky to be alive.

05:38.986 --> 05:40.446
There's a psycho down the road.

05:40.571 --> 05:43.322
He had her locked up in his house,
tried to burn her to death.

05:43.447 --> 05:45.657
The house is still on fire,
she only just got out,

05:45.782 --> 05:47.866
and the piece of shit
still has a kid with him.

05:47.991 --> 05:50.993
- And Craig...
- And a guy named Craig.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.328
What's your name?

05:56.996 --> 06:00.164
- I'm Victoria.
- You're OK, now, Victoria.

06:00.289 --> 06:02.165
Everything's going to be OK,
alright?

06:02.290 --> 06:04.249
Yes. I'd like to report a fire.

06:04.917 --> 06:06.709
And a kidnapping.

06:08.126 --> 06:09.795
Where did you say you came from?

06:09.920 --> 06:12.837
Just down the road about a mile back,
out in the woods.

06:12.963 --> 06:14.755
Yeah. Sam's Gas. Highway 19.

06:14.880 --> 06:17.674
He's gonna take them
and we'll never see them again.

06:17.799 --> 06:20.675
It's alright, darling.
Just relax, OK?

06:21.926 --> 06:23.677
Where did you say you were from?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.136
Haverhill.

06:27.011 --> 06:28.887
Is that here in Colorado?

06:30.347 --> 06:31.931
Colorado?

06:37.642 --> 06:40.102
- Feeling any better?
- Did she call?

06:42.395 --> 06:43.561
Then no.

06:45.980 --> 06:48.815
I'm sorry we weren't fast enough
to catch Bing Partridge,

06:48.940 --> 06:50.941
but we have patrolmen
searching the city.

06:52.608 --> 06:53.942
He's gone.

06:56.235 --> 06:58.236
Why don't you get out of here?

06:58.861 --> 07:00.696
Really. Get some rest.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.989
I'll let you know
if anything turns up,

07:03.114 --> 07:04.698
with Partridge or Vic.

07:04.823 --> 07:07.199
As soon as she calls,
we have to be ready to move.

07:07.324 --> 07:08.658
Faster this time.

07:08.783 --> 07:11.368
You've been saying that
for over an hour.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.872
When will the Brat call?

07:44.510 --> 07:45.428
Can I just...

07:45.553 --> 07:47.595
It's dangerous.

07:49.638 --> 07:51.180
Even for me.

07:51.597 --> 07:53.724
How does it work?

07:54.724 --> 07:56.183
You don't want to know.

07:56.683 --> 07:58.559
I do, actually.

08:00.601 --> 08:03.020
By tearing the fabric
between the real world

08:03.145 --> 08:05.187
and the world of thought.

08:09.356 --> 08:10.733
I told you.

08:14.526 --> 08:16.068
Vic?

08:16.193 --> 08:19.070
- I'm in Colorado. My bridge is gone.
- What? Are you OK?

08:19.195 --> 08:23.488
Manx destroyed it. If I can't get
to Christmasland, I can't save Craig.

08:23.613 --> 08:24.906
OK. That's OK.

08:25.032 --> 08:27.408
Maybe we can find them
before they get there.

08:28.283 --> 08:29.867
I need you to ask your bag.

08:34.119 --> 08:35.703
Where is the Wraith?

08:43.666 --> 08:44.958
Vic...

08:46.500 --> 08:48.585
...my tiles say...

08:50.794 --> 08:53.004
"gun barrel".

08:53.629 --> 08:55.756
"Gun barrel"?
What does that mean?

08:56.964 --> 08:58.382
Gun barrel?

08:59.883 --> 09:01.759
We're in Gun Barrel.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.263
Vic? What's going on?

09:11.764 --> 09:12.639
He's here, Maggie.

09:28.898 --> 09:30.273
Do you have a gun in this place?

09:38.611 --> 09:41.488
Make sure that's loaded.
You take that baby and hide.

09:46.907 --> 09:47.824
Ever shot a gun?

10:06.000 --> 10:08.543
This is a mistake, Lou Carmody.

10:09.835 --> 10:12.087
One you'll come to regret.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.463
Put your hands up,
you Coney Island motherf...

10:16.672 --> 10:17.840
Move.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.717
Taking orders from a woman

10:21.842 --> 10:24.468
is not a good habit to get into,
young man.

10:24.593 --> 10:26.719
Take it from one who knows.

10:26.844 --> 10:27.804
Shut the hell up.

10:27.929 --> 10:29.096
Craig?

10:29.221 --> 10:30.222
Vic?

10:31.055 --> 10:32.389
I'm here.

10:32.515 --> 10:33.890
Jesus, Vic, thank God.

10:34.015 --> 10:36.433
- Hold tight. I'll get the keys.
- OK.

10:39.684 --> 10:40.560
It's you!

10:40.685 --> 10:42.978
Come back here and play with me,
Vic McQueen!

10:43.103 --> 10:44.562
Come back here and play!

10:47.022 --> 10:47.855
Shit.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.607
Put down the gun, Lou Carmody.

10:50.732 --> 10:53.775
Stop saying my name!
You don't know anything about me.

10:53.900 --> 10:57.027
I know your record of stupid crimes.

10:57.653 --> 11:00.570
Shoplifting, vandalism,
smoking underage,

11:00.695 --> 11:02.947
all in a juvenile attempt
for attention.

11:03.072 --> 11:05.115
It hasn't worked, though,
has it, my boy?

11:05.240 --> 11:08.366
Craig, I need you to listen to me.
There's no key in this damn car.

11:08.491 --> 11:10.492
We need to get you out another way.

11:11.535 --> 11:14.494
OK, Vic, hold on.
I got an idea. Hold on.

11:16.703 --> 11:18.788
Whoopsie! This is fun!

11:18.913 --> 11:20.956
Drop your weapon, son.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.790
I'm not your son.

11:27.876 --> 11:29.961
You're no one's son, are you?

11:32.504 --> 11:34.713
Poor Lou Carmody.

11:36.297 --> 11:39.757
You've never known
the softness of a woman's touch.

11:40.341 --> 11:44.552
Never had an ounce of affection,
not even from your own mother.

11:44.677 --> 11:46.511
And yet here you are,

11:47.011 --> 11:50.138
risking your life
for this Vic McQueen.

11:52.180 --> 11:54.807
She won't reward you
if that's what you're hoping.

11:54.932 --> 11:56.349
Hand it over.

12:05.062 --> 12:06.896
There you are, you goof!

12:18.820 --> 12:22.572
When it comes to women,
nice guys finish last, Lou Carmody.

12:23.196 --> 12:25.573
Especially when they look like you.

12:40.622 --> 12:41.915
The gun!

12:54.713 --> 12:57.131
Charlie! Charlie Manx!

13:06.928 --> 13:08.971
Come on out and say how-do.

13:10.847 --> 13:12.556
Well, look at you.

14:09.919 --> 14:12.128
Regards from Jolene July
and Margaret Leigh,

14:12.253 --> 14:13.754
you son of a bitch.

14:15.047 --> 14:16.339
Dude...

14:17.465 --> 14:18.715
Get off!

14:20.049 --> 14:22.091
Get off me, you little shit!

14:24.343 --> 14:25.844
Craig, I got you.

14:27.595 --> 14:29.221
Safety first!

14:32.306 --> 14:33.723
What?

14:38.684 --> 14:40.685
Tug of war, tug of war!

14:42.686 --> 14:44.896
- Tug of war!
- You've got to get out of here.

14:45.020 --> 14:46.605
I can't. It's the car.

14:47.355 --> 14:49.773
I can't get through.
Let go of me.

14:49.898 --> 14:52.274
- No!
- Let me go. Get out of here.

14:52.399 --> 14:54.192
No, you can't...

14:55.609 --> 14:58.027
Save yourself
or I swear I'll freaking kill you.

14:58.152 --> 15:00.528
- No.
- You've got to get out of here.

15:00.654 --> 15:03.405
- I can't. No...
- I love you...

15:06.281 --> 15:09.116
Get out of here, Vic, go!

15:19.372 --> 15:20.538
God damn it!

16:19.236 --> 16:20.529
Hey.

16:21.028 --> 16:23.113
It's OK. You're safe.

16:24.364 --> 16:27.032
That... whatever the hell he is...

16:27.156 --> 16:28.533
Charlie Manx.

16:29.992 --> 16:31.034
He's...

16:31.993 --> 16:35.911
Whatever he is,
he's cuffed to an ICU bed

16:36.036 --> 16:38.788
with a US marshal
standing outside his door.

16:42.540 --> 16:45.875
- What about the car?
- I don't know. The police took it.

16:46.292 --> 16:47.876
They need to destroy it.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.836
Dude, you did destroy it.

16:51.253 --> 16:53.838
With that guy
and the little kid inside.

17:06.051 --> 17:07.803
Oh, man...

17:09.220 --> 17:10.722
I'm sorry.

17:14.765 --> 17:16.641
He was my best friend.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.481
He was my best friend.

17:31.733 --> 17:33.317
Starting the fire...

17:34.942 --> 17:39.528
That was to hurt that...
Charlie Manx, wasn't it?

17:43.196 --> 17:47.198
I saw him age, like, a hundred years
in, like, a second.

17:48.657 --> 17:51.701
I saw his skin blister
like it was on fire,

17:51.826 --> 17:53.327
even though it wasn't.

17:54.661 --> 17:55.786
He was.

17:55.911 --> 17:57.746
Because of the car, right?

17:58.996 --> 18:00.581
I read comic books.

18:00.706 --> 18:03.665
I fully believe
weird, unexplainable shit

18:03.790 --> 18:05.333
happens in this world.

18:09.002 --> 18:12.045
For the record, I told the police
that he burned up in the car fire.

18:13.879 --> 18:16.172
I told them that you lit it
to stop him.

18:18.214 --> 18:19.632
I did.

18:21.966 --> 18:23.760
You're like a superhero.

18:24.343 --> 18:26.385
Like the Golden Blade Warrior.

18:26.510 --> 18:29.387
Except without
all the body armor and...

18:32.638 --> 18:33.806
You have nicer hair.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.851
Mr Carmody.

18:40.976 --> 18:42.394
It's Lou.

18:43.603 --> 18:44.853
Lou Carmody.

18:44.978 --> 18:47.021
Your cholesterol
is through the roof, Lou,

18:47.146 --> 18:49.647
but otherwise
you are ready for discharge.

18:57.902 --> 18:59.778
My number's on the back,

18:59.903 --> 19:04.072
in case you're ever in Colorado
and you're in need of a young ward.

19:06.698 --> 19:08.115
You know...

19:09.824 --> 19:11.326
a sidekick.

19:20.497 --> 19:21.915
Thank you.

19:44.802 --> 19:48.387
You have frostbite on your left arm,

19:48.512 --> 19:50.179
torn tendons in your right leg,

19:50.304 --> 19:53.014
and you sprained your ankle
pretty good, Miss McQueen.

19:53.139 --> 19:55.848
I want you to keep that arm
clean and covered.

19:56.641 --> 19:58.892
- Thank you.
- One more thing.

20:00.226 --> 20:03.937
You may want to visit
your gynecologist when you get home.

20:05.354 --> 20:06.521
Excuse me?

20:07.063 --> 20:09.564
It's so early.
I thought you didn't know.

20:09.689 --> 20:12.316
You're pregnant.
Only a few weeks.

20:45.542 --> 20:47.167
Sorry to bother you, Miss Leigh.

20:47.292 --> 20:49.419
I wanted you to know
that Vic McQueen is safe

20:49.544 --> 20:51.211
and Charlie Manx is in custody.

20:51.795 --> 20:53.170
Yeah, I know.

20:54.295 --> 20:55.171
Thank you.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.840
She hasn't returned any of my calls.

20:58.965 --> 21:00.549
She's been through a lot.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.300
Yeah.

21:03.676 --> 21:06.428
Any luck finding Bing Partridge?

21:08.303 --> 21:10.304
That's the other reason I'm here.

21:17.474 --> 21:20.601
Would you mind asking
your Scrabble tiles where he is?

21:21.268 --> 21:24.562
It's addictive, right?
Once you've seen it.

21:32.774 --> 21:34.525
OK, so...

21:37.610 --> 21:41.987
I was born three months premature
with a collapsed lung.

21:42.612 --> 21:44.655
Doctors told my mother
I wouldn't make it.

21:44.780 --> 21:46.364
It didn't look like I would.

21:46.781 --> 21:48.949
So she brought me home
to my grandfather.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.742
He's a santero in Mattapan.

21:52.326 --> 21:53.410
And...

21:54.453 --> 21:58.954
my mother swears he saved my life
with offerings to the Orishas.

22:02.039 --> 22:06.083
Yeah, I've never been
a religious woman until yesterday.

22:07.250 --> 22:10.377
I thought that story was
just superstitious family lore.

22:11.627 --> 22:15.713
My Scrabble tiles don't have anything
to do with your family's religion.

22:15.838 --> 22:17.381
Sure, maybe not.

22:17.505 --> 22:18.882
But maybe...

22:19.631 --> 22:21.799
there are forces at work
in this world

22:21.924 --> 22:23.217
beyond our comprehension.

22:23.842 --> 22:27.720
Yeah. Daniel Moore
and Haley Smith are gone.

22:28.511 --> 22:31.680
Joe Bly and Craig Harrison
are both dead.

22:32.597 --> 22:35.724
There is a cost
to messing with those forces.

22:35.849 --> 22:38.475
There's a cost to ignoring them.

22:39.684 --> 22:41.685
Bing Partridge is a dangerous man.

22:41.810 --> 22:43.644
If we don't stop him...

22:44.479 --> 22:46.104
he will kill again.

23:13.243 --> 23:14.785
Where's Bing?

23:58.725 --> 24:00.184
What does that mean?

24:01.602 --> 24:02.936
I don't know.

24:06.187 --> 24:08.396
Are you sure
you unscrambled it correctly?

24:09.022 --> 24:10.231
No.

25:41.903 --> 25:43.405
Miss McQueen.

25:43.530 --> 25:45.531
Good to see you on your feet.

25:46.698 --> 25:48.115
He's in a coma.

25:48.657 --> 25:52.076
There's about as much brain activity
as a can of creamed corn.

25:53.702 --> 25:55.995
- What happened to the car?
- It's totaled.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.246
State police impounded
what was left of it.

26:01.914 --> 26:03.331
I need to see him.

26:05.374 --> 26:07.166
By myself, if that's alright.

26:07.292 --> 26:09.042
It's against policy.

26:11.168 --> 26:13.712
You ever looked
into the eyes of evil, Marshal?

26:17.131 --> 26:18.590
Please.

26:19.381 --> 26:21.091
Or I'll never sleep again.

26:56.568 --> 26:58.235
Charlie Manx.

27:01.236 --> 27:03.529
I hope you're dreaming of me
as you lie there,

27:03.654 --> 27:06.489
like a sick dog
waiting to be put down.

27:07.281 --> 27:10.450
While you're lying there rotting
in a bag of your own flesh,

27:10.575 --> 27:14.201
I will find Christmasland
and I will torch the place.

27:15.494 --> 27:17.911
Just like I torched your fucking car.

27:50.679 --> 27:53.597
Your father's going to meet us
at the reception after.

27:57.766 --> 27:59.059
OK.

28:00.100 --> 28:01.851
You look real pretty.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.273
Ready to go?

28:14.066 --> 28:15.651
Almost.

28:17.276 --> 28:19.361
OK, honey. Take your time.

28:28.532 --> 28:31.450
So we're high as kites,
stumbling around Market Basket.

28:31.575 --> 28:34.868
Fricking Craig, he's got, like,
six steaks stuffed under his shirt

28:34.993 --> 28:36.620
like some kind of bandit.

28:36.745 --> 28:39.162
Problem is,
he doesn't realize they're leaking.

28:39.287 --> 28:42.456
Jenny Bennett's working the register.
I'll never forget it.

28:42.581 --> 28:45.457
She looks at him and she's, like,
"Are you bleeding?"

28:45.582 --> 28:46.583
Craig looks down,

28:46.708 --> 28:48.918
sees the steak juice
seeping through his shirt,

28:49.043 --> 28:50.710
and I swear to God, the kid faints!

28:52.002 --> 28:54.712
I have to catch him and make sure
he doesn't hit his head.

28:55.837 --> 28:57.547
I still can't go in there.

28:57.673 --> 28:59.632
Banned for life from Market Basket.

29:03.425 --> 29:05.051
Fricking Craig...

29:05.551 --> 29:06.927
He was a good kid.

29:07.761 --> 29:10.303
I still can't believe
that piece of shit got him.

29:15.098 --> 29:17.933
- The service was beautiful.
- Yeah.

29:19.892 --> 29:23.060
I made his mom some of
your favorite stew in a crockpot.

29:24.728 --> 29:26.646
- Thanks. She'll like that.
- Yeah.

29:28.438 --> 29:30.481
I don't know. I look at her...

29:31.107 --> 29:33.816
I went to school with her, and...

29:35.067 --> 29:37.693
I know it's awful to think it, but...

29:40.695 --> 29:43.071
Vicky, what if it had been you?

29:43.571 --> 29:44.822
- Ma...
- What if...

29:44.947 --> 29:47.490
- No. Don't cry.
- What if you didn't get away?

29:47.615 --> 29:50.825
Ma, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

29:51.951 --> 29:54.035
Yeah. Yeah...

30:01.706 --> 30:02.872
Ma...

30:03.456 --> 30:04.581
Yeah?

30:05.833 --> 30:08.334
What would you have done without Dad?

30:09.418 --> 30:12.877
I used to think about that a lot
when he was in the Gulf.

30:13.002 --> 30:15.587
I remember thinking
I would die without him.

30:18.423 --> 30:20.340
Truth is, I...

30:22.466 --> 30:25.135
I would have had to stay
with my mother for a while.

30:25.260 --> 30:27.177
And then none of us
would be here now,

30:27.302 --> 30:30.429
because I would be
in jail for murder.

30:33.139 --> 30:35.931
We didn't have a good relationship
like you and me.

30:38.349 --> 30:40.767
I need a drink.
You want something?

30:41.476 --> 30:42.935
No, I'm OK.

30:43.018 --> 30:44.103
OK.

31:05.113 --> 31:05.947
Hey.

31:10.575 --> 31:12.159
How you holding up?

31:13.034 --> 31:15.077
- Yeah.
- You alright?

31:26.040 --> 31:27.250
I'm pregnant.

31:32.586 --> 31:34.837
- Sure?
- Yeah.

31:43.759 --> 31:45.176
You know...

31:47.218 --> 31:49.595
- You don't have to...
- It's Craig's.

32:01.851 --> 32:03.144
We'll figure it out.

32:23.613 --> 32:24.821
Vic.

32:29.616 --> 32:31.116
Mrs Harrison.

32:36.578 --> 32:38.078
I'm so sorry.

32:43.372 --> 32:46.416
My mother brought you a stew.
I should have brought you some.

32:49.001 --> 32:51.877
You're the only one that knows
what a good boy my Craig was.

32:53.920 --> 32:55.296
I loved him.

32:57.755 --> 32:59.839
His heart was solid gold.

33:01.591 --> 33:03.966
Nobody in that building
has a goddamn clue.

33:04.091 --> 33:06.426
Fricking Matty and Molly,
laughing and carrying on

33:06.551 --> 33:08.260
like it's a goddamn party.

33:10.428 --> 33:13.764
Nobody in there is worth the dirt
under my boys fingernails.

33:14.889 --> 33:16.681
Yet here they all are,

33:17.224 --> 33:18.599
and he's...

33:23.685 --> 33:26.395
He doesn't even have
a decent headstone.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.896
We'll get him one.

33:30.731 --> 33:32.774
This town sucks, Vic.

33:34.274 --> 33:36.984
You get the hell out of town
while you're still young.

33:37.776 --> 33:39.443
Go be an artist.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.238
Craig always said you were real good.

36:11.772 --> 36:13.316
The tiles told me you'd be here.

36:15.733 --> 36:17.651
Sorry. I should have called.

36:20.152 --> 36:23.446
When the Wraith got Joe,
all I wanted to do was disappear.

36:26.196 --> 36:29.365
When I found you...
behind that dumpster,

36:29.490 --> 36:31.617
I hated thinking
that you felt lonely enough

36:31.742 --> 36:33.534
to try something like that.

36:37.036 --> 36:38.620
I get it now.

36:42.247 --> 36:44.165
I'm sorry about Craig.

36:51.002 --> 36:52.669
I'm sorry about Joe.

36:56.504 --> 37:00.381
And Daniel, and Haley
and all the others.

37:00.506 --> 37:02.090
Me too.

37:03.674 --> 37:06.426
But you stopped him, Vic.
Don't ever forget that.

37:06.968 --> 37:08.844
We stopped him.

37:09.553 --> 37:11.763
Yeah. We did.

37:15.848 --> 37:17.933
Bing Partridge is still out there.

37:19.391 --> 37:23.727
I'm going to stay here and work
with Detective Hutter to find him.

37:27.562 --> 37:29.563
I can't go back to Iowa.

37:32.814 --> 37:34.691
I can't stay here.

37:41.736 --> 37:42.695
RISD?

37:46.113 --> 37:49.074
Go there and do what?
Paint pictures?

37:52.659 --> 37:55.035
All those kids...
Daniel, Haley...

37:55.494 --> 37:57.453
What if they're still
in Christmasland?

37:58.078 --> 38:01.997
You destroyed the Wraith.
Maybe Christmasland went with it.

38:03.581 --> 38:04.873
Have you asked your bag?

38:05.666 --> 38:07.458
I got the blank tile.

38:19.506 --> 38:21.715
Take care of yourself, Maggie Leigh.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.675
You too, Brat.

38:53.023 --> 38:54.607
Spit for me, please.

38:57.150 --> 38:58.651
That's good.

38:58.776 --> 39:02.237
Now I need you to start brushing
twice a day, alright?

39:02.362 --> 39:03.362
OK.

39:04.071 --> 39:05.279
Can I have some candy?

39:05.405 --> 39:08.365
Candy at the dentist?
How about an apple instead?

39:19.286 --> 39:20.705
Hey.

39:20.830 --> 39:23.914
Brush and floss, shine or rain,

39:24.331 --> 39:27.499
all good girls...
get candy canes!

39:29.042 --> 39:32.669
Thank you, Mr Anderson.
Please empty the trash.

39:32.794 --> 39:34.044
Sure.

39:52.221 --> 39:54.888
Only about 500 ever produced.

39:55.014 --> 39:58.391
Each was handmade.
No two are alike.

40:01.225 --> 40:03.309
I'm surprised no one wanted her.

40:05.602 --> 40:08.646
Scrapyard's probably
the best place for it.

40:26.572 --> 40:30.699
Hark! The herald angels sing

40:30.782 --> 40:32.992
Glory to...

40:33.075 --> 40:36.535
Hi, Weasel. Season's greetings
from Christmasland.

40:37.745 --> 40:39.537
Where is Father?

40:39.954 --> 40:41.621
We are hungry.

40:42.372 --> 40:45.206
Bring us something to eat,
Vic McQueen.

40:48.167 --> 40:50.501
Come to Christmasland.

40:51.043 --> 40:52.919
We are waiting for you.

40:55.920 --> 40:57.088
You alright?

40:59.131 --> 41:00.757
Did you hear that?

41:01.715 --> 41:03.133
The wind?

41:04.633 --> 41:05.925
Yeah.

41:07.593 --> 41:08.802
Yeah.

41:10.928 --> 41:14.472
Look, I don't want to rush you.
Like, have your moment.

41:14.972 --> 41:17.766
But it's cold
and it is creepy as hell out here.

41:17.891 --> 41:21.017
Plus I know a place down the road.
They got some killer hot cocoa.

41:21.142 --> 41:23.393
- No hot cocoa.
- OK, no hot cocoa.

41:23.518 --> 41:25.936
Let's... not do that.

41:26.644 --> 41:28.520
No hot cocoa, no candy canes,

41:28.645 --> 41:31.564
no Christmas ornaments,
Christmas music...

41:31.689 --> 41:33.607
Dude, whatever you want.

41:35.066 --> 41:37.859
I want to keep working
in your garage.

41:38.984 --> 41:41.027
For an exploitative wage.

41:41.152 --> 41:44.988
Well, when business picks up
then I can, you know, pay.

41:45.112 --> 41:46.447
That's...

41:50.449 --> 41:54.576
I'm going to make sure this baby
never meets anyone like Charlie Manx.

41:57.078 --> 41:58.495
Done and done.

42:42.684 --> 42:44.769
Alright, girl...

42:45.811 --> 42:47.354
Let's try...

42:47.853 --> 42:48.687
this.

42:51.897 --> 42:53.774
Malik, his eyes are open.

42:54.732 --> 42:58.692
Nothing different on the ECG.
Must be a muscle spasm.

43:00.944 --> 43:04.529
Hi, Mr Manx. We're just going to be
giving you your blood transfusion.

43:11.157 --> 43:13.367
Your boy, Josiah...

43:14.451 --> 43:17.494
There's room for him in Christmasland
with the other children.

43:18.994 --> 43:20.996
I could give him a new life.

43:21.121 --> 43:24.998
I could give him a nice new smile...

43:25.124 --> 43:26.207
Let go...

43:26.332 --> 43:30.960
I have seen him
in the Graveyard of What Might Be,

43:31.085 --> 43:33.211
pining for his mother.

43:33.336 --> 43:36.671
What kind of woman leaves her child
to be raised by videogames

43:36.796 --> 43:38.380
and computer screens,

43:39.005 --> 43:44.007
so that she may work among derelicts
and perverts in a place like this?

43:44.842 --> 43:46.217
Help me...

43:47.093 --> 43:48.385
Help...
