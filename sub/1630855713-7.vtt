Hope helped to save this town.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.891
So let's cut her some slack, huh?

03:02.974 --> 03:05.351
All your concerns will be addressed,

03:05.435 --> 03:08.688
as well as the concerns
of everyone affected by the fire.

03:08.771 --> 03:15.445
Also, Town Council will be hosting a food
and clothing drive day after tomorrow.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.447
It's gonna be at the park on River Road.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.532
-I'm gonna hand these out.
-Please, that's right.

03:19.616 --> 03:23.328
And I urge all of you
to come and bring whatever you can.

03:23.411 --> 03:26.164
We will get through this difficult time.

[gentle music playing]

03:41.804 --> 03:42.972
The food okay?

03:43.056 --> 03:45.558
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm just not…

03:45.642 --> 03:46.809
Yeah, me neither.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.731
Sweetheart, you gotta eat.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.732
I know.

03:53.608 --> 03:56.110
-Did you call Dr. Lorton?
-Yeah.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.656
She said you could
come in tomorrow for a D&C.

03:59.739 --> 04:02.242
I would've asked what it was,
but I figured you'd know.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.203
It's a recommended procedure
after a miscarriage.

04:06.996 --> 04:08.665
They, uh, they scrape the…

04:09.540 --> 04:12.460
uterus to prevent infection.

[Jack] Jesus.

04:16.631 --> 04:17.840
You don't want to do it?

04:18.967 --> 04:19.968
No.

04:20.051 --> 04:21.928
I mean, I should do it. I…

04:23.304 --> 04:25.723
It's just that it's really painful, and…

04:27.600 --> 04:31.604
they have to put you under anesthesia,
and after everything, it's like…

04:33.356 --> 04:36.359
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, no, no. Hey, hey.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.611
Okay. [clears throat] Sorry.

04:38.695 --> 04:41.281
No, come on. What can I do?

04:41.364 --> 04:44.284
I think I just need to get up and get out.

04:46.494 --> 04:49.080
Yeah, it might be good
to see everyone too.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.207
What?

04:52.000 --> 04:52.875
I just--

04:52.959 --> 04:56.379
I don't have it in me
to tell the story a hundred times.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.048
No, no, I just… I meant it'd be…

04:59.132 --> 05:02.010
It would be good to be around people
who care about you.

05:02.093 --> 05:05.555
Joey and Brie are the only ones that know,
and they're gonna be discreet.

05:06.764 --> 05:10.518
It's just, in LA, I got to be
so anonymous, and out here, it's like…

05:10.601 --> 05:11.477
Hey, hey, hey.

05:11.561 --> 05:14.063
You don't need to worry about anyone
but yourself right now.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.567
Okay? And if you don't have it in you
to do that, I'm gonna do that for you.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.945
-Come here. Come here.
-[crying softly]

05:25.074 --> 05:27.327
[Hope] Vernon, you have a visitor.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.080
Why don't you two sit and talk?

05:31.164 --> 05:33.249
And if you need me,
I'll be inside trying to figure out

05:33.333 --> 05:35.585
how to restart a municipal water supply.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.669
[Doc chuckles]

05:41.090 --> 05:43.009
I would have called
instead of just dropping by,

05:43.092 --> 05:45.595
but it felt like
we might have a lot to discuss

05:45.678 --> 05:48.097
before we open the clinic
back up tomorrow.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.307
We sure do.

05:51.142 --> 05:52.769
I came because I wanted to find out

05:52.852 --> 05:55.355
why you didn't just tell me
about your eyesight.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.565
[Doc sighs]

05:59.192 --> 06:00.568
I was doing fine.

06:01.986 --> 06:05.031
And then that was the first time
it ever affected my work.

06:05.114 --> 06:09.118
And as soon as it did,
I took myself out of the equation, and…

06:09.786 --> 06:12.121
Still, I deserved to know.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.456
Yes, you did.

06:15.750 --> 06:16.876
I apologize.

06:18.795 --> 06:20.296
I thought I had more time.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.923
In full disclosure…

06:24.092 --> 06:27.887
this was one of the reasons
that I hired you, for this moment.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.641
Because if my eyesight worsens,

06:31.724 --> 06:34.477
then I'm gonna need someone
to take over this clinic.

06:35.144 --> 06:36.270
And you want me?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.481
Well, that was the plan, yeah.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.568
In all honesty, after what happened
with Mel, I'm having my doubts.

06:42.652 --> 06:45.279
If I could take back
what happened with Mel, I would.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.241
And I would love
to have her back at the clinic

06:48.324 --> 06:50.076
if that's what you both want.

06:51.160 --> 06:52.120
Well, it's good to hear.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.747
But as far as me taking it over…

06:56.833 --> 06:59.293
I think I'm gonna need some time
to think about that.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.587
Think about it? Think about what?

07:01.671 --> 07:04.632
Look, I'm flattered,
and it is a very generous offer,

07:04.715 --> 07:07.427
just one that I wasn't expecting.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.221
And you deserve to have somebody
that is ready to fully commit.

07:10.304 --> 07:12.265
You can't commit, well, hell…

07:13.391 --> 07:15.143
You know what? If you can't commit,

07:15.226 --> 07:17.687
then I have much bigger things
that I need to figure out.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.397
And you do too.

07:33.870 --> 07:34.745
Thanks.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.291
Hey.

07:40.543 --> 07:44.422
-Didn't know you were back in town.
-Yeah. Yeah, I, uh, got in yesterday.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.048
I was worried about you.

07:47.091 --> 07:48.759
I was worried about you too.

07:53.806 --> 07:57.143
I'm so sorry about your cabin
and Emerald Lumber.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.312
Yeah, Preacher's letting me
stay above the bar, so--

07:59.395 --> 08:01.647
As he should. Jack filled me in.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.235
There would be no bar without you.
You're a legit hero.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.403
I don't know about that.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.530
I just did
what anyone in my position would do.

08:09.614 --> 08:15.077
I mean, I don't know if just anyone would
use a flamethrower to start a backfire.

08:15.703 --> 08:16.829
That's pretty badass.

08:18.414 --> 08:20.958
Not as badass
as standing up for yourself in court.

08:21.042 --> 08:22.210
Hmm.

08:25.755 --> 08:27.381
-[Brady] These help?
-Mmm.

08:28.883 --> 08:29.717
Yeah.

08:30.927 --> 08:31.928
It did.

08:32.512 --> 08:34.222
I wish I could've been there for you.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.726
But you weren't.

08:40.478 --> 08:41.812
You told me not to come.

08:43.105 --> 08:44.732
Because I can't trust you.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.652
So I don't feel safe with you.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.737
And I need that right now.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.490
You know, after everything, I…

08:53.032 --> 08:55.034
I need to feel safe.

08:55.117 --> 08:57.078
I wish you could understand that.

08:58.037 --> 09:03.084
I am doing everything I can, I swear,
to get out of this situation.

09:03.167 --> 09:04.669
What are you doing?

09:04.752 --> 09:05.586
Tell me.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.088
I can't.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.133
And therein lies the problem.

If you can't talk to me, just…

09:22.228 --> 09:25.106
tell me you'll find someone
you can talk to.

[phone ringing]

09:49.880 --> 09:51.007
What you doing?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.134
Hope has me making a list
of everyone's needs,

09:53.217 --> 09:56.679
so we can make sure everything donated
at the drive goes to the right people.

09:56.762 --> 09:59.307
Sounds like she thinks of you
as more than just her aide.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.767
Hey, so I've been meaning to ask,

10:01.851 --> 10:04.353
are you still thinking about
going to college this fall?

10:04.437 --> 10:05.271
No.

10:05.980 --> 10:09.567
I haven't told my mom yet, but I know
in my gut that college isn't right for me.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.902
Plus, I love it here.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.362
Wait, um…

10:15.239 --> 10:16.073
Why?

10:16.866 --> 10:18.409
Are you going back to Stanford?

10:18.492 --> 10:20.578
After everything that happened yesterday,

10:21.662 --> 10:23.414
I know what's most important to me.

10:25.958 --> 10:26.876
And that's you.

10:28.127 --> 10:30.129
So I want to be wherever you are.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.177
I should probably get a job, though.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.387
I can only mountain climb
so many times a week.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.889
Any idea what you want to do?

10:39.972 --> 10:41.974
If I could get paid
to stare into your eyes, I would.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.934
I've created a monster.

10:44.560 --> 10:45.728
Yes, you have.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.814
[tranquil music playing]

10:53.569 --> 10:55.321
You sure you don't want me to stay?

10:56.447 --> 10:57.573
No, I'm okay.

10:58.741 --> 11:00.451
You need to deal with the bar.

11:01.035 --> 11:05.956
Plus, Brie offered to bring me muffins.
I think I'm feeling ready for muffins.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.001
Okay, well, I'm glad you're gonna have
someone to talk to while I'm gone.

11:10.544 --> 11:11.504
Oh, and Hope called.

11:11.587 --> 11:15.299
She said that there's gonna be
a food and clothing drive in a few days.

11:15.383 --> 11:16.717
We don't have to go, but--

11:16.801 --> 11:19.970
No, it's okay. I'll look around
and see if we have anything to donate.

11:20.596 --> 11:22.056
If you need me…

11:22.139 --> 11:23.557
I'll call you, I promise.

I'm fine if you want to tell Preacher.

11:34.652 --> 11:36.153
Don't worry about me.

-Yeah.

Fire in the area's mostly contained.
Things are clearing up.

What's unclear is why
you're not returning my calls.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.871
Or talking to me right now?

12:31.208 --> 12:32.543
Maybe 'cause you're married.

[gentle music playing]

12:34.879 --> 12:37.506
Yeah, a guy from your brigade told me.

12:38.382 --> 12:41.093
-The better question is, why didn't you?
-Because it's over.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.346
Jay and I are separated.

12:45.890 --> 12:48.434
We were gonna start mediation,
but then fire season took over--

12:48.517 --> 12:50.770
Well, if that's the case,
why keep it a secret?

12:50.853 --> 12:52.605
Because I didn't
want to complicate things.

12:52.688 --> 12:54.857
Yeah, well, I think we're past that now.

12:57.818 --> 12:59.779
Okay, I'll go.

13:01.489 --> 13:03.491
Just keep this easy.

You know, this isn't easy, Kaia.

13:09.663 --> 13:12.374
I've got real feelings for you.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.630
I have them for you too.

13:18.923 --> 13:20.424
After my marriage ended,

13:20.508 --> 13:23.886
I was determined to not
get emotionally involved with anyone, but…

13:23.969 --> 13:24.845
But?

13:25.346 --> 13:26.597
But I met you.

[gentle music continues]

13:33.604 --> 13:34.522
I, uh…

Yeah.

[Brie] So how you doing?

13:57.002 --> 14:00.172
We don't have to go there if you
don't want to, but I'm here if you do.

14:01.590 --> 14:02.883
I'm just getting through it.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.763
I want to hear about you.
Jack said that the trial was really rough.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.431
It was. It was hard.

But Mike was there,
and he was really great.

Uh, wait, wait, so…

14:17.398 --> 14:18.941
Back up. So you…

14:19.024 --> 14:22.695
You asked Brady not to come,
but then had Mike come instead?

14:22.778 --> 14:25.948
No. Mike was there purely by coincidence.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.994
-But I'm really glad he was.
-Wait, what's going on with you and Brady?

14:31.370 --> 14:32.872
We're not in a good place.

14:32.955 --> 14:36.709
-Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I had no idea.
-You've been going through a lot.

14:36.792 --> 14:37.626
What happened?

14:37.710 --> 14:39.920
He just won't be honest with me.

14:40.004 --> 14:44.341
It's like he feels like he has to
hide the truth or I won't love him.

14:44.425 --> 14:48.387
Yeah, I just can't handle that
kind of uncertainty in my life right now.

14:48.470 --> 14:50.139
And I'm afraid he won't change.

14:50.890 --> 14:52.975
A very expensive therapist once told me,

14:53.058 --> 14:56.770
the first thing you fight about will
always be the same thing you fight about.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.733
-Oh God. I hope that's not true. [laughs]
-[laughs] Why?

15:00.816 --> 15:02.568
What was your first fight
with Jack about?

15:02.651 --> 15:03.485
Charmaine.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.612
That tracks.

15:04.695 --> 15:09.575
[laughing] Yeah, but, see, maybe that's
proof that you guys can move past this.

15:09.658 --> 15:12.161
If you still want him in your life at all.

15:13.245 --> 15:14.788
Yeah, I hope you're right.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.499
I really have always admired the way

15:17.583 --> 15:21.086
you and Jack just find your way
through whatever life throws at you.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.673
And what you're going through now,
it's not any different.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.593
Thank you.

15:27.676 --> 15:30.346
[soft music playing]

15:39.396 --> 15:41.690
Wow, what are you wearing?

15:41.774 --> 15:44.652
It is inappropriate
to comment on a lady's appearance.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.445
Oh, no, I'm not commenting.

15:46.528 --> 15:48.906
-I am questioning all of it.
-[both laughing]

15:49.490 --> 15:51.325
Well, this little fashionista find

15:51.408 --> 15:54.912
is a combo of Connie and Lizzie's
hand-me-downs.

15:55.579 --> 15:59.166
What is left of my very smoky wardrobe
is now at the dry cleaners.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.919
-I'm so sorry about your house.
-Thank you.

16:02.002 --> 16:05.172
-Yeah.
-But I'm okay. That's all that matters.

16:05.255 --> 16:07.341
And I'm actually living
with Connie right now.

16:07.424 --> 16:10.844
Because, sadly,
her general store burned down,

16:10.928 --> 16:13.681
and I figured, you know,
misery loves company.

16:14.723 --> 16:19.019
But if I'm being completely honest,
it is the company that is miserable.

16:19.103 --> 16:21.522
-Why's that?
-There's just so many rules.

16:21.605 --> 16:26.568
I poured my morning smoothie
in a cup designated for "water"

16:26.652 --> 16:27.820
and all hell broke loose.

16:28.445 --> 16:32.574
You know, I do have
a guest room that you could use.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.867
You'd make your own rules.

16:34.618 --> 16:35.452
Thank you.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.956
Well, I don't want to…
You know, I don't want to impose.

16:39.039 --> 16:40.249
Oh no, I'd love to have you.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.667
Oh.

16:42.876 --> 16:46.088
Hey, just so I'm prepared,

16:46.171 --> 16:50.718
did you talk to Doc yet
after that whole falling out?

16:50.801 --> 16:53.262
Yeah, we did.
Actually, I think we're better.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.056
-He's given me a lot to think about.
-Good.

16:58.600 --> 16:59.768
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

17:04.273 --> 17:05.983
[Ava] Thanks for the extra blankets, Hope.

17:06.066 --> 17:08.402
[Hope] You're welcome at the clinic
as long as you need.

17:09.278 --> 17:11.822
Have you and Tara decided
what you're going to do--

17:11.905 --> 17:14.950
With the scorched piece of earth
formerly known as our farm?

17:15.034 --> 17:15.951
Stop.

17:16.035 --> 17:18.495
It is, though. There's nothing left.

17:18.579 --> 17:23.083
And, yeah, we have. Tara got offered
a great job back in San Francisco,

17:23.167 --> 17:25.169
and she wasn't gonna take it, but…

17:26.170 --> 17:30.132
now that the farm is gone,
she doesn't really have a reason to stay.

17:30.215 --> 17:32.342
She's coming to pick up Chloe today.

17:33.677 --> 17:34.511
Really?

17:36.472 --> 17:37.473
God.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.225
I'm gonna miss those two.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.437
I was only supposed to be here a week.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.023
I have to get back
to my place in Portland.

17:46.648 --> 17:47.900
So we're planning to sell.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.863
I was hoping
you weren't going to say that.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.616
Isn't there another way?

17:55.699 --> 17:56.742
Well, believe it or not,

17:56.825 --> 17:59.661
we already got a call
from someone interested in the land.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.955
-A company called High Front.
-The developers.

18:02.039 --> 18:02.956
You heard of 'em.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.167
They've been trying
to get into Virgin River for years.

18:05.250 --> 18:07.294
Could you hold them off for a bit?

18:08.087 --> 18:10.589
I'd like to try to find you another buyer.

18:10.672 --> 18:15.219
Someone who would
keep the integrity of the original farm,

18:15.302 --> 18:18.263
rebuild it like it was,
give it a second chance.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.015
I know that's what Mom would want.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.477
Who do you think would be interested?

18:23.560 --> 18:27.272
I have no idea,
but I never let that stop me before.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.568
[upbeat music playing on stereo]

18:37.324 --> 18:39.535
There you go. Enjoy.

18:43.372 --> 18:44.248
Hey.

18:44.331 --> 18:48.836
Uh, so Brady's, um, settled upstairs.

18:49.461 --> 18:51.755
Yeah… I know.

18:51.839 --> 18:56.009
And I know what you're thinking,
but it's temporary.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.928
You know, I feel for the guy, right?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.180
Losing his cabin and everything,

19:00.264 --> 19:03.684
but you really think it's a good idea
to have him move back in?

19:03.767 --> 19:06.687
I promised Brie
that I would give him a chance.

19:06.770 --> 19:09.690
And besides, we might not even
have a bar if it wasn't for him.

19:09.773 --> 19:12.317
You know, maybe a leopard
can change its spots.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.487
Well, what more are you willing to lose
to find that out?

19:15.571 --> 19:17.364
[mournful music playing]

19:18.323 --> 19:19.158
You okay?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.201
Yeah, we, um…

19:23.370 --> 19:24.496
We lost the baby.

19:24.580 --> 19:25.789
No…

19:25.873 --> 19:27.875
No, man…

19:29.293 --> 19:30.460
You okay?

19:31.044 --> 19:32.337
Honestly, I don't know.

19:34.173 --> 19:38.135
But whatever I'm feeling,
Mel's gotta be feeling it ten times over.

19:39.136 --> 19:42.181
I mean, her going through this
after everything she's been through.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.557
I am so sorry, man.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.727
Just trying to support her.
Don't make this about me.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.729
This happened to both of you, Jack.

19:50.105 --> 19:50.981
It's funny, you know.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.065
I didn't even know…

19:53.066 --> 19:55.402
I wanted this, to be a father, but you…

19:57.404 --> 19:58.989
You picture it, you know?

20:00.574 --> 20:01.909
Father-daughter dance.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.996
Little League games, school plays.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.917
You see their little eyes
looking at you and…

20:12.544 --> 20:15.964
Oh, Preach, it's really hard to say
goodbye to someone that you never met.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.508
She existed for you.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.552
[crying] Yeah, she did.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.641
I even came up with names, you know?

20:26.391 --> 20:27.935
Ah, it's just so unfair.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.438
I mean, with Charmaine,
when she took the twins away from me,

20:31.521 --> 20:34.691
at least I had someone
I could be angry with, you know? I could…

20:35.484 --> 20:37.486
I could blame someone, but this…

20:38.153 --> 20:41.490
You two… will have a family one day.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.201
You focus on that.

20:44.910 --> 20:45.744
Yeah.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.094
[mournful music continues]

21:21.238 --> 21:22.239
[clears throat]

21:26.785 --> 21:28.578
[phone line ringing]

21:31.123 --> 21:32.958
Hey, you. How are you?

21:33.041 --> 21:34.710
[Mel] You know, I've been better.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.879
I thought holding up in the cabin
was gonna help, but, um…

21:37.963 --> 21:41.008
Well, it's a little…
a little too quiet in here.

21:41.091 --> 21:43.093
I knew I should have
come up there yesterday.

21:43.677 --> 21:46.596
Nate said he could watch the kids.
I could be on the road in an hour.

21:46.680 --> 21:50.600
No, Jo. Look, I don't know how to
say this without hurting your feelings.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.602
I just-- I don't want you here right now.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.812
Okay.

21:53.895 --> 21:54.896
Um…

21:54.980 --> 21:55.981
You get a pass.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.482
Why not?

21:59.067 --> 22:02.654
Because I'm afraid if I see you,
I won't be able to hold it together.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.822
You don't have to.

22:03.905 --> 22:06.158
Sweetie, I get it. Really, I do.

22:07.492 --> 22:10.120
You can't hide from your pain forever.

22:10.203 --> 22:12.622
I mean, grief comes in waves,
you know that.

22:12.706 --> 22:14.291
I know. I do, but I…

22:14.875 --> 22:16.877
I can't let myself go there again.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.048
I won't do it. I know where it leads.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.468
This time, it's gonna be different.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.262
No one is gonna let you go
where you've been before, Mel.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.307
You have so many people who love you.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.435
Honey, I promise,
we will all be there to catch you.

22:33.518 --> 22:34.394
Yeah.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.524
[car approaching]

22:51.244 --> 22:52.079
Get in.

22:53.288 --> 22:54.289
[Brady chuckles]

22:54.373 --> 22:55.665
Nice to see you too.

23:02.422 --> 23:06.843
I am so glad your pretty face
made it out unscathed.

23:08.178 --> 23:09.012
And why is that?

23:09.096 --> 23:12.224
We're going into the glamping business
with Brie's brother, Jack.

23:12.307 --> 23:15.352
You're gonna move drugs
through Jack's glamping business?

23:15.435 --> 23:19.106
No, I'm going to move money through it.

23:19.189 --> 23:21.066
I need you to manage the day-to-day

23:21.149 --> 23:23.777
so Jack doesn't stick his nose
where it doesn't belong.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.779
I don't work for Jack.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.239
I'll take care of it.

23:31.660 --> 23:32.911
What about the drugs?

23:34.788 --> 23:36.581
Where are they? How are we moving them?

23:36.665 --> 23:38.166
You do as you're told.

23:39.167 --> 23:40.085
And then we'll talk.

23:41.044 --> 23:41.878
Yeah.

23:43.171 --> 23:45.173
[dark music playing]

23:55.058 --> 23:56.059
[door opening]

23:56.143 --> 23:58.478
Hi! Oh my gosh. Come in.

23:59.354 --> 24:00.188
Hi.

24:02.482 --> 24:04.276
Do you want to come and sit down?

24:04.359 --> 24:05.402
We can't stay.

24:06.361 --> 24:08.530
Oh. Oh, yeah, um…

24:09.614 --> 24:11.992
Ava told me that you were leaving town.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.286
-Yeah.
-You got a job offer?

24:14.369 --> 24:16.913
Mmm-hmm. We're driving up tonight.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.290
Tonight?

24:18.373 --> 24:21.293
Yeah, they wanted me to start right away.

24:22.377 --> 24:24.254
-Oh, okay.
-So…

24:25.589 --> 24:27.591
Goodbye farm life, and…

24:28.592 --> 24:30.802
hello, city living.

24:30.886 --> 24:31.970
[Mel laughs] Yeah.

24:32.053 --> 24:36.433
I fully support your reverse-Green Acres
thing. You know, especially now.

24:37.517 --> 24:38.935
-[Tara] Thanks.
-Yeah.

24:39.019 --> 24:41.480
Life takes some real unexpected turns,

24:41.563 --> 24:42.481
doesn't it?

24:44.608 --> 24:47.235
[voice breaking] Mel,
I don't know how to thank you.

24:47.986 --> 24:49.946
For what you did for Chloe and Ava.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.531
Oh, I, uh…

24:51.615 --> 24:53.825
I was just in the right place
at the right time--

24:53.909 --> 24:56.328
No, you ran into a burning house.

24:57.245 --> 24:58.163
And saved them.

25:00.081 --> 25:02.709
I'm from Virgin River. I know kindness.

25:03.335 --> 25:04.586
And you are…

25:04.669 --> 25:06.338
You're something special.

25:08.465 --> 25:09.925
I'm gonna miss you.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.593
I'm gonna miss you too.

25:15.013 --> 25:16.389
[Chloe cooing]

25:16.973 --> 25:21.061
And you, I fully expect
your first two words

25:21.144 --> 25:22.562
to be Aunty Mel.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.897
[both laughing]

25:24.397 --> 25:25.398
Okay?

25:28.276 --> 25:29.611
Bye, sweet girl.

25:30.779 --> 25:32.489
Don't grow up too fast, okay?

25:36.159 --> 25:38.161
Okay, now go before I won't let you.

25:38.245 --> 25:39.746
[Tara] Phew! Okay.

25:43.542 --> 25:44.751
We'll see you again.

25:44.834 --> 25:46.836
[gentle music playing]

26:01.685 --> 26:03.687
[phone chiming]

26:15.949 --> 26:16.950
Mel.

26:19.995 --> 26:20.996
It's time.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.082
[bittersweet music playing]

26:29.129 --> 26:30.130
Okay.

26:32.173 --> 26:34.175
[bittersweet music continues]

26:46.062 --> 26:47.063
[Mel] Wait.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.524
-Um…
-[Jack] What?

26:50.358 --> 26:53.153
We're a little early.
Can we just sit here for a minute?

26:53.236 --> 26:54.279
Of course.

26:56.489 --> 26:57.532
Come here.

27:02.537 --> 27:05.707
The last time I had to have a D&C was

27:07.000 --> 27:08.001
before…

27:09.169 --> 27:11.755
I made it to term
with the baby that I had lost.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.340
And…

27:15.300 --> 27:18.094
the waiting room, it's… it's the worst.

27:20.889 --> 27:21.931
There's, like…

27:23.224 --> 27:26.019
ten pregnant mothers in there, just…

27:27.437 --> 27:29.147
you know, happy, healthy.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.444
Waiting to check on their babies.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.822
Then there's me.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.326
Just sitting there.

27:43.662 --> 27:46.039
-Knowing that mine's gone.
-Hey.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.584
You know, and nothing…

27:50.251 --> 27:51.586
Nothing makes sense.

27:53.296 --> 27:55.507
Except for the fact
that I let myself down again.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.842
No, no, no, hey, hey, hey.

28:00.428 --> 28:02.055
-[crying] I'm sorry.
-No, no, no.

28:02.138 --> 28:04.057
I'm not gonna let you beat yourself up

28:04.140 --> 28:06.935
for something that
you had no control over, you hear me?

28:08.812 --> 28:10.105
You did nothing wrong.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.565
All right? Not a damn thing.

28:25.787 --> 28:28.832
[Brady on recording] You're gonna move
drugs through Jack's glamping business?

28:28.915 --> 28:31.376
[Melissa] No,
I'm going to move money through it.

28:33.128 --> 28:34.587
She's using Jack as a pawn.

28:34.671 --> 28:35.547
Yeah.

28:39.259 --> 28:41.594
[Mike sighs] These make sense now.

28:43.471 --> 28:45.181
Why didn't you show me these earlier?

28:46.391 --> 28:49.310
I was hoping they were just
having dinner, nothing more.

28:50.019 --> 28:52.105
Jack has no idea what she's capable of.

28:52.689 --> 28:53.940
We need to tell him.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.944
We can't.
We got one shot at taking her down.

28:58.027 --> 29:00.488
-We can't do anything to risk that.
-He could go down with her.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.491
-I'm not gonna let that happen.
-Or he could get hurt, so could Mel.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.952
You need to arrest her now.
Look, we have everything we need.

29:06.035 --> 29:08.788
No, what we got is…
is vague and circumstantial.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.291
-We need more.
-What if I testify?

29:11.875 --> 29:13.543
You're a convicted criminal.

29:13.626 --> 29:17.046
Testifying would be part of your deal.
They'd know that.

29:17.130 --> 29:19.257
No, we need proof, undeniable proof

29:19.340 --> 29:22.969
that the money that she's moving
through the glamping site is drug money.

29:25.722 --> 29:27.265
I think we should have you wear a wire.

29:27.348 --> 29:28.183
Yeah, okay.

29:29.100 --> 29:31.603
Whatever it takes,
but I need this to end now.

29:31.686 --> 29:34.105
If something happens to Jack,
it'll destroy Brie,

29:34.189 --> 29:35.774
and I can't let that happen.

29:35.857 --> 29:38.193
-Okay, Mike? I won't.
-I won't either.

29:40.069 --> 29:42.030
[ladies laughing]

29:42.113 --> 29:44.616
I love the raffle idea, Lizzie.

29:44.699 --> 29:47.410
Now we need to find some folks
to donate prizes.

29:47.494 --> 29:50.246
[Connie] I can ask Bert
if he'll do a free tune-up.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.332
Preacher might do cooking classes.

29:52.415 --> 29:55.210
And Charlie might do flying lessons.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.253
Oh, you're gonna
have to convince him, Hope.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.713
Connie, stop.

29:59.297 --> 30:03.635
Now, I just need to find someone
to buy Lilly's farmland.

30:04.260 --> 30:06.888
Someone who cares about
keeping the integrity

30:06.971 --> 30:09.474
of the Virgin River community intact.

30:09.557 --> 30:12.894
It's a nice idea, Hope,
but with the damage to the B&B

30:12.977 --> 30:16.105
and Nick investing
in Jack's glamping business,

30:16.189 --> 30:17.899
-we're tapped out.
-[Hope] Mmm-hmm.

30:19.234 --> 30:20.819
[Lizzie] I hope you're not looking at me.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.779
My mom gets mad
when I buy a pair of shoes.

30:22.862 --> 30:24.405
Can you imagine if I bought a farm?

30:25.990 --> 30:28.326
Plus, once I tell her
I'm not going to college,

30:28.409 --> 30:29.828
she's cutting me off anyway.

30:29.911 --> 30:32.080
I didn't know you'd made that decision.

30:32.163 --> 30:35.333
I have, but I haven't felt
strong enough to call my mom.

30:35.416 --> 30:37.627
After all that you went through
in the fire?

30:38.211 --> 30:40.630
Sweetheart, I can tell you,

30:40.713 --> 30:43.174
you are incredibly strong.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.093
Coming from you, that means a lot.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.262
Maybe your strength rubbed off on me.

30:48.555 --> 30:49.931
All your strength.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.101
Putting this together for people
who've lost so much

30:53.184 --> 30:54.978
when you've lost so much too.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.188
You guys really inspire me.

30:57.272 --> 30:58.898
You inspire us.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.233
Call your mom.

31:00.316 --> 31:02.443
We'll help you figure out the rest.

31:02.527 --> 31:06.406
If anyone can stitch this town
back together, it's us.

31:06.489 --> 31:07.490
Isn't it, girls?

31:07.574 --> 31:09.534
-[Hope] Mmm-hmm. Yup.
-[ladies laughing]

31:09.617 --> 31:10.785
[knock on door]

31:11.744 --> 31:13.580
-Hey! What are you doing here?
-[Mike] Hey.

31:13.663 --> 31:14.581
I was just…

31:15.456 --> 31:18.001
I was thinking about you, and…

31:18.710 --> 31:20.879
I wondering if we could talk.
Is now a good time?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.714
Yeah, of course. Come on in.

31:24.966 --> 31:28.344
So, the jury returned a verdict today.

31:29.679 --> 31:31.848
Guilty, on all counts.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.559
That's… great.

31:35.184 --> 31:36.811
Yeah. It's great.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.606
-How are you feeling about it?
-Not as good as I hoped.

31:40.690 --> 31:46.070
I mean, I knew a guilty verdict
wouldn't, you know, erase the trauma, but…

31:46.863 --> 31:47.739
[bottles opening]

31:47.822 --> 31:51.159
I thought it might
put me at ease a little.

31:52.201 --> 31:57.582
Well, I'm no expert, but I think
what you're feeling is completely normal.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.375
I know.

32:00.209 --> 32:01.044
I just…

32:01.127 --> 32:05.465
I know how rare it is for the prosecution
to be successful in these kinds of cases.

32:05.548 --> 32:07.091
And I'm grateful to them.

32:08.801 --> 32:13.139
And I'm so relieved Don cannot do this
to another woman anytime soon.

32:16.392 --> 32:17.977
I don't know, I just keep…

32:19.437 --> 32:23.441
waiting to feel like
this is all finally behind me.

32:24.484 --> 32:27.195
Maybe it'll, you know,
just take more time.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.158
But, hey, whatever you need along the way,

32:32.241 --> 32:35.578
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you.

32:36.287 --> 32:37.121
Thanks.

32:39.999 --> 32:41.918
[both laughing]

32:42.001 --> 32:43.002
[Brie] So…

32:44.921 --> 32:46.839
What did you want to talk to me about?

32:49.926 --> 32:51.678
Um, okay.

32:52.720 --> 32:55.473
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry

32:55.556 --> 32:58.726
if I did anything
to cross a line in Sacramento.

32:58.810 --> 32:59.978
No, you didn't.

33:00.061 --> 33:02.939
Hey, you're…
You're going through a lot with trial,

33:03.022 --> 33:05.942
Brady, and I'm not trying
to get in the way of any of that.

33:06.025 --> 33:07.110
Brie, I…

33:08.653 --> 33:09.654
I care about you,

33:09.737 --> 33:12.782
and I only want what's best for you.

33:14.951 --> 33:17.203
I know. I want that too.

33:17.829 --> 33:21.249
That's why I think what almost happened…

33:22.625 --> 33:23.835
almost happened.

33:25.003 --> 33:27.380
-But it didn't. And…
-Mmm-hmm.

33:27.463 --> 33:28.464
[Brie clears throat]

33:29.465 --> 33:31.884
I'm glad that we're friends.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.180
Actually, I'm more than glad.
I'm thrilled.

33:37.015 --> 33:38.057
I am too.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.600
-Great.
-Great.

33:46.232 --> 33:47.233
You okay?

33:49.569 --> 33:50.862
You still cramping?

33:52.989 --> 33:55.408
Yeah, a little bit,
but it's getting better.

34:00.788 --> 34:02.331
You wanna know something?

34:03.332 --> 34:04.208
[Mel] Mmm.

34:05.501 --> 34:07.587
I'm astounded by your bravery.

34:07.670 --> 34:08.504
Thanks.

34:10.256 --> 34:12.925
I'm not any braver than anyone else
in this town, though.

34:13.551 --> 34:15.136
People have lost so much.

34:18.389 --> 34:22.393
Maybe it would be
good for us to tell people.

34:24.729 --> 34:27.607
You know, more people
to lean on that understand…

34:29.233 --> 34:30.735
what we're going through.

34:30.818 --> 34:31.819
If you're sure.

34:35.406 --> 34:38.910
Why don't we get Hope
to use the phone tree?

34:39.619 --> 34:40.661
Spread the word.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.373
We don't have to keep retelling the story.

34:44.457 --> 34:45.958
Yeah, that's a good idea.

-Hey!

35:16.614 --> 35:18.950
-[Denny] Can I buy some raffle tickets?
-Of course you can.

35:19.033 --> 35:20.076
How goes the job search?

35:20.159 --> 35:23.412
Well, I filled out an application
at Bert's auto shop,

35:23.496 --> 35:25.206
and the pedal boat rentals,

35:25.289 --> 35:28.960
and this dietary supplement company,
something called referral marketing.

35:29.043 --> 35:30.378
Yeah, don't do that one.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.130
[Lizzie] And I have some news.

35:32.213 --> 35:34.382
I called my mom and told her my decision.

35:34.465 --> 35:36.801
-That's amazing. How do you feel?
-Strong.

35:37.677 --> 35:38.553
And broke.

35:38.636 --> 35:42.306
You know, Lizzie, you've really proven
you're more than just my aide.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.309
Right, I'm also your chauffeur
and your chef.

35:45.393 --> 35:47.937
Community work definitely suits you.

35:48.020 --> 35:50.982
So, why don't we make it official?

35:51.065 --> 35:54.026
Would you like to be the Chief of Staff
to the Mayor of Virgin River?

35:55.319 --> 35:57.155
Pays more than you're making now,

35:57.238 --> 35:59.407
and there's a real future in it
if you want.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.659
Wow, that's…

36:03.578 --> 36:05.288
Yes, thank you.

36:05.371 --> 36:08.249
Don't thank me! We got a lot of
work to do before the Labor Day Carnival.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.294
-The town's still doing that?
-Not without your help we're not.

36:14.297 --> 36:16.007
[Connie] I know! I was cranky.

36:16.507 --> 36:21.637
I just didn't expect you to take so long
blow-drying your hair this morning.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.890
Well, it was only 20 minutes, Connie.

36:23.973 --> 36:25.391
-[woman] Here you go.
-Thank you.

36:25.474 --> 36:29.353
If you had told me that your blow-dryer
neither blows nor dries, then maybe--

36:29.437 --> 36:32.899
I just think
we need to find a better schedule.

36:33.649 --> 36:37.236
-Or how about I buy you a new blow-dryer?
-Oh!

36:37.320 --> 36:41.574
Yeah! As a little, you know,
"thank you" for your generous hospitality.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.993
[titters and laughs] Great!

36:44.076 --> 36:47.163
Oh! Oh, and when you're out shopping,

36:47.246 --> 36:49.957
maybe see if you can find a new perfume.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.587
I think I'm allergic
to your present fragrance.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.887
If that offer to stay at your place
still stands, do you--

37:02.970 --> 37:04.388
-You can move in tonight.
-Thank you.

37:08.434 --> 37:09.936
[Hope] Hi, Kaia.

37:11.354 --> 37:13.231
-Here you go.
-[woman] Thanks so much.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.315
[Doc] Yeah.

37:16.317 --> 37:18.527
Hey, Doc. Do you have a sec?

37:20.321 --> 37:21.781
Yeah. Yeah.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.576
So, did you make up your mind?

37:26.535 --> 37:28.162
Yes, but…

37:29.121 --> 37:32.375
first, I wanted to explain
why I needed to think about it.

37:34.252 --> 37:35.795
When I left my fiancée,

37:35.878 --> 37:38.256
I wanted to get
as far away from San Diego as I could.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.550
You know, hide out
in a different life entirely.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.844
I didn't plan on being here long-term.

37:43.928 --> 37:47.223
I thought I'd miss the city
and pace of a hospital, the innovation--

37:47.306 --> 37:48.516
With all due respect,

37:48.599 --> 37:51.185
I don't need to hear your life story
if you're gonna turn me down.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.270
I'm not.

37:53.604 --> 37:57.775
Because, as it turns out,
I don't miss any of it.

37:57.858 --> 38:01.904
I may not be great at it yet…
but being a small-town doctor,

38:01.988 --> 38:04.198
and working closely with you
and our patients

38:04.282 --> 38:07.451
has been way more fulfilling
than I could ever have imagined.

38:09.954 --> 38:13.082
So, yes, I would love to be considered.

38:15.167 --> 38:16.711
Thank you, Dr. Hayek.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.546
And in the meantime,

38:19.380 --> 38:21.549
I am here to support you,
whatever you need.

38:23.009 --> 38:23.884
Well…

38:25.636 --> 38:27.471
let's give it a try.

38:33.602 --> 38:34.937
[Hope laughs nervously] Okay!

38:35.021 --> 38:37.940
Hi, everybody!
I'm just gonna say a couple words.

38:38.899 --> 38:41.402
Thank you all so much for being here.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.741
We have suffered tremendous loss.

38:47.700 --> 38:52.663
But when I look at all of your faces,
loss is not what I see.

38:53.873 --> 38:58.419
I see people who've opened their homes
to neighbors in need.

38:58.502 --> 39:02.256
I see boxes brimming
with clothing and food,

39:02.340 --> 39:03.966
and it warms my heart.

39:06.093 --> 39:10.598
As do the faces
of the brave members of Cal Fire here…

39:10.681 --> 39:12.725
[all clapping and cheering]

39:18.022 --> 39:22.068
…who risked their lives and limbs
to save our little corner of the world.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.531
Still, I know some of you
are considering leaving Virgin River,

39:27.615 --> 39:31.035
and I understand,
the task of rebuilding is daunting.

39:31.118 --> 39:36.665
But if we work together, we will rise
from the ashes stronger for it,

39:36.749 --> 39:39.293
like many of us have done before.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.920
That's the power…

39:42.004 --> 39:43.297
of Virgin River.

39:44.173 --> 39:45.925
[crying] To begin again.

39:46.008 --> 39:48.761
Not in spite of what we lost,
but because of it.

39:49.804 --> 39:55.267
So, today, after we mourn our losses,
let's focus on what we have.

39:57.478 --> 39:58.479
Each other.

40:01.315 --> 40:04.276
Hey! Preacher told me.

40:05.027 --> 40:06.445
I'm so sorry, man.

40:06.529 --> 40:07.905
Yeah, thanks.

40:08.531 --> 40:12.576
[clears throat] Listen, there's actually
something I wanted to talk to you about.

40:13.619 --> 40:16.956
We're about to break ground
on construction of the glamping site,

40:17.039 --> 40:19.250
and I heard about Emerald Lumber.

40:19.333 --> 40:23.170
So I was thinking maybe you and your guys,

40:23.254 --> 40:25.631
if you're looking for work,
you could head up a team.

40:25.714 --> 40:28.509
You could run the project
and we could get you started ASAP.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.595
Yeah, absolutely. Thanks.

40:31.679 --> 40:32.972
-All right.
-Okay.

40:33.681 --> 40:35.141
-We'll see how it goes.
-Yeah.

40:41.021 --> 40:42.022
[Preacher] Hey.

40:44.733 --> 40:47.445
So… how is your ex?

40:48.237 --> 40:49.572
Making peace with our divorce.

40:49.655 --> 40:51.657
-I started the process.
-You did?

40:52.241 --> 40:53.659
I owed it to myself.

40:54.493 --> 40:58.372
Look, I understand
that my situation with Jay is complicated,

40:58.456 --> 41:00.082
as is my job.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.584
But…

41:02.835 --> 41:04.420
is there any way
you can just forgive me,

41:04.503 --> 41:06.130
so we can give this a real shot?

41:07.590 --> 41:11.969
Well, you know, um…
complicated is my specialty.

41:13.053 --> 41:18.434
And I would like to apologize
for the way I reacted.

41:19.477 --> 41:21.479
We're just getting to know each other,

41:21.562 --> 41:25.608
and I can't expect you to offer up
all your secrets all at once.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.526
Well…

41:28.611 --> 41:32.114
I mean, you know one of mine.
It's only fair that I know one of yours.

41:32.948 --> 41:34.658
Oh, you better make it a good one.

41:35.659 --> 41:36.660
Well…

41:37.411 --> 41:38.454
Yes?

41:39.121 --> 41:39.997
I…

41:43.292 --> 41:45.419
am crazy about you.

41:48.297 --> 41:50.799
[inhales sharply] Ooh! That is…

41:50.883 --> 41:52.301
That is pretty darn good.

41:52.885 --> 41:54.303
But not really a secret.

41:56.972 --> 41:58.933
[gentle music playing]

42:00.434 --> 42:01.519
Um…

42:01.602 --> 42:03.312
I'm gonna get us some coffee.

42:08.901 --> 42:10.110
[Jay laughing]

42:11.320 --> 42:12.571
Oh, man.

42:12.655 --> 42:13.906
You must be Preacher.

42:14.823 --> 42:16.033
You must be Jay.

42:17.159 --> 42:20.329
Nice to put a shockingly handsome face
to the guy who's dating my wife.

42:22.456 --> 42:25.167
Uh, listen.
You know, I'm sorry, man. I get it.

42:25.668 --> 42:26.669
Uh…

42:27.294 --> 42:30.673
Seeing her with anyone else,
it must be difficult for you.

42:30.756 --> 42:31.715
It is.

42:33.926 --> 42:34.927
But I know her.

42:35.010 --> 42:37.096
I know she'll always
choose her job over you,

42:37.179 --> 42:39.473
and I'll always be part of her job.

42:41.892 --> 42:43.602
That must be difficult for you.

42:43.686 --> 42:45.688
[pensive music playing]

42:53.445 --> 42:55.656
-Hey! Hey, honey.
-[Ava] Hey.

42:57.700 --> 42:59.827
Hey, it's okay. I'm okay.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.745
I'm just a sucker for a good speech.

43:01.829 --> 43:05.457
Yeah? Was it good enough
to get you to stay?

43:06.041 --> 43:08.669
Finding the right person
to buy the farm is important.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.504
I guess I can stick around until I do.

43:11.589 --> 43:12.423
Good.

43:13.048 --> 43:16.760
I mean, I never asked you what you have
to get back to Portland for anyway.

43:16.844 --> 43:20.264
Just a failing music career
and an ex-girlfriend who stole my cat.

43:20.347 --> 43:22.308
Oh, nice! So there's really no rush.

43:22.391 --> 43:23.601
-Yeah, not really.
-Okay.

43:25.144 --> 43:28.230
I'm just gonna grab some food,
but I'll see you soon? We'll talk more?

43:28.314 --> 43:29.356
Yeah, okay.

43:31.400 --> 43:32.568
-Hey, there.
-Hey.

43:32.651 --> 43:33.611
Hey.

43:34.653 --> 43:35.487
How are you?

43:36.405 --> 43:37.698
I'm… good.

43:39.283 --> 43:40.242
Yeah.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.327
I'm glad we came.

43:42.036 --> 43:42.870
Good.

43:43.621 --> 43:44.538
Yeah, me too.

43:46.332 --> 43:49.335
You know, sometimes I forget
how special this town is.

43:49.418 --> 43:50.419
[Jack] Hmm.

43:51.754 --> 43:53.464
Everybody's so supportive.

43:54.757 --> 43:59.053
Yeah. It certainly makes the thought
of trying again a little less scary.

44:00.929 --> 44:01.930
Yeah.

44:05.893 --> 44:08.479
-[indistinct chatter]
-[gentle music playing]

44:08.562 --> 44:10.481
-[Brie] Oh, hey.
-Hey.

44:10.564 --> 44:12.399
-[Brie] How's it going?
-All right.

44:12.483 --> 44:14.026
So, I was thinking.

44:14.109 --> 44:16.070
-You know, since we're friends now.
-Mmm-hmm.

44:16.153 --> 44:18.614
How do you feel about
doing something friendly this week?

44:18.697 --> 44:19.573
[Mike] Depends.

44:19.657 --> 44:21.450
-What you got in mind?
-Oh, depends, maybe?

44:21.533 --> 44:24.286
I don't know, I was thinking
maybe a baseball game.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.830
-Order some wings.
-Uh-huh. You're speaking my language.

44:26.914 --> 44:27.998
-Important question.
-Yeah.

44:28.082 --> 44:30.084
-Ranch or blue cheese?
-Hey, Mike.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.670
-Brie.
-[Brie] Hey.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.755
I see you found someone to talk to.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.758
-Are you being serious right now?
-Yeah, I am.

44:38.258 --> 44:39.760
I mean, it makes sense, right?

44:40.469 --> 44:42.888
Mike's a good cop, dependable.

44:44.390 --> 44:46.350
-Honest.
-Brady.

44:47.142 --> 44:49.311
It's all good.
Brie and I are just friends.

44:49.395 --> 44:51.021
-Okay?
-You must think I'm an idiot.

44:51.105 --> 44:53.482
Brady, this is not the time
or the place, okay?

44:53.565 --> 44:55.484
Mike and I are friends. You know this.

44:55.567 --> 44:58.195
He was there for me during
a difficult moment, which I appreciated--

44:58.278 --> 44:59.279
Hold up.

45:00.364 --> 45:03.742
-What do you mean he was there for you?
-Okay. Hey. Hey.

45:03.826 --> 45:06.286
I happened to be in Sacramento.

45:07.287 --> 45:09.373
-He was at the trial?
-It's not like that.

45:09.456 --> 45:12.000
-Brady, cut it out! Brady! Stop!
-[Mike] Hey! Calm…

45:14.420 --> 45:15.838
-Brie, listen, I--
-No, stop!

45:15.921 --> 45:17.256
-No, I wasn't--
-Brady!

45:18.716 --> 45:19.675
It's over.

45:20.259 --> 45:22.720
-What?
-Officially, okay? We are done.

45:22.803 --> 45:23.804
-Brie, come on--
-No!

45:23.887 --> 45:25.347
-I wasn't trying--
-Brady, I mean it.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.935
Now, just walk away, please.

45:30.018 --> 45:32.104
[tense music playing]

45:39.695 --> 45:41.613
[gentle music playing]
