Yes, ma'am.

<i>What's going on?</i>

00:18.226 --> 00:19.477
Is there anything I can do?

00:19.519 --> 00:21.604
You can keep it to yourself.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.273
<i>Justin Lieu.</i>

00:23.314 --> 00:25.066
I spent a decade
doing search and rescue

00:27.360 --> 00:28.862
<i>I'm Liliana.</i>

00:28.903 --> 00:30.405
I clean your office.

00:30.447 --> 00:32.157

to have some coffee with me?

00:32.198 --> 00:33.199
How about now?

00:33.241 --> 00:34.284
[car horn honks]
[crash]

00:34.325 --> 00:35.201
Are you having an affair?

00:35.243 --> 00:37.203
No. Never.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.539
He thinks
that we need time apart.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.833
- And thanks
to Mr. Dayton's generosity,

<i>Chicago Med is able</i>

<i>I know the tech.</i>

00:47.839 --> 00:49.424
I promise you,
it won't let you down.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.843
- You know tech,
but you don't know surgery.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.928
- Jack Dayton has bought
controlling interest

00:53.970 --> 00:55.972
in the Gaffney Medical Group.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.767
- So I guess
he's in charge now.

- Man, I've been seeing
these 2.0 ads everywhere.

01:12.614 --> 01:14.240
Kind of makes me wish
I needed surgery.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.701
- Yeah.
These are a lot of signs.

01:16.743 --> 01:18.203
- I guess
there are worse things

01:18.244 --> 01:20.246
than having
Jack Dayton's PR machine

01:20.288 --> 01:21.623
- in our corner, though, right?
- Hey, look.

01:21.664 --> 01:24.751
As long as he keeps us ahead
of the supply shortages,

01:24.793 --> 01:26.961
- I am not complaining.
- You know what?

01:27.003 --> 01:28.797
Come to think of it,
I saw a whole new shipment

01:28.838 --> 01:29.964

01:30.006 --> 01:32.884
- Let me catch up
with you later.

Hey, Maggie.

Oh, hey, Sharon.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.764
How you doing?

01:37.806 --> 01:39.391
I'm OK.

01:40.934 --> 01:43.603
You know, Ben used to make
me breakfast every morning.

01:43.645 --> 01:45.563
- You two
still aren't talking, huh?

01:45.605 --> 01:46.981
- Uh-uh.

01:47.023 --> 01:49.442
- Well, I know it must be hard
not having him around,

01:49.484 --> 01:52.779
so I'm here
if you ever need to talk.

01:52.821 --> 01:54.656
- I know.
Thank you.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.038
Liliana.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.748
Good morning, Daniel.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.542
- What a pleasant way
to start the day.

02:05.583 --> 02:08.128
- Thank you, though
I just finished my shift.

02:08.169 --> 02:09.462
I am on my way out.

02:09.504 --> 02:10.922
- You know
what I've been thinking?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.216
We've had a couple of
very pleasant coffees together.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.759
How about we, um,

02:14.801 --> 02:17.345
I don't know,
advance to dinner?

02:17.387 --> 02:19.305
OK, sure.

02:19.347 --> 02:20.306
- You want
to pick the restaurant?

02:20.348 --> 02:22.183
- Should I?
- Better idea.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.477
Let me cook.
I'll make zrazy.

02:24.519 --> 02:27.480
- Zrazy. Fantastic.
What is that?

02:27.522 --> 02:29.691
- It's Polish dish.
It's my grandmother's recipe.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.401
OK.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.112
- So my apartment, 8:00?
- Great.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.406
- I'll text you my address.
- I will see you there.

02:40.493 --> 02:41.619
What have we got?

02:41.661 --> 02:43.371
- Martha Kittle,
75 years old.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.664
Took a bad spill
in her kitchen.

02:44.706 --> 02:45.749
- Let's get you
checked out, Martha.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.792
I need an X-ray
in treatment five.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.002
Grandma!

02:49.044 --> 02:50.378
I hear you, Alexander.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
I'm coming, Grandma.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.256
Where are they taking her?

02:53.298 --> 02:54.507
- Just into her room
to check her out.

02:54.549 --> 02:55.842
You can go in with her
if you want.

02:55.884 --> 02:56.885
What's that?

02:56.926 --> 02:58.345
- That's an X-ray machine.

02:58.386 --> 02:59.971
- Will it hurt her?
- No, no.

03:00.013 --> 03:03.224
That's just so the doctor
can help your grandmother.

03:05.435 --> 03:07.354
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.855
His name's Alexander.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.191
Looks to me like he could be
on the autism spectrum.

03:11.232 --> 03:12.442
He's having trouble
making sense

03:12.484 --> 03:13.818
of what's going on
with his grandmother.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.528
Leave her alone!

03:15.570 --> 03:17.572
- Oh!
- Get away from her!

03:17.614 --> 03:18.531
- She's just trying
to get an X-ray.

03:18.573 --> 03:19.908
- Yeah, Alexander.
It's OK.

03:19.949 --> 03:21.868
- I'm not going
to let you hurt her.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.620
- Alexander, how about
we get you a little space?

03:23.661 --> 03:25.330
Would that be good?
Let's get you some space.

03:25.372 --> 03:26.873
Thank you, Nancy.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.166
Let's go home, Grandma.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.085
Alexander, please stop.

03:30.126 --> 03:31.252
Let's go home.

03:31.294 --> 03:32.671
I need to be here.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.382
And I need you
to calm down, please.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.217
These are nice people.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.053
They're trying to help me.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.263

Is Jack Dayton gonna have

04:04.786 --> 04:07.539
fresh donuts for us every day?

04:09.624 --> 04:11.459
I suppose these aren't allowed
on your renal diet.

04:11.501 --> 04:13.294
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

04:13.336 --> 04:16.506
You're the one missing out
on my cranberry juice.

04:17.799 --> 04:19.759
- Whoa.
Brand-new espresso machine?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.344
Yeah, a generous gift

04:21.386 --> 04:23.471
bestowed upon us
by Jack Dayton.

04:23.513 --> 04:25.181
- Well, hopefully,
these upgrades

04:25.223 --> 04:26.891
extend to patient care too.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.560
- Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that, pal.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.894
Dean won't be swayed

04:29.936 --> 04:32.522
by Dayton's new shiny toys
and sweets.

04:32.564 --> 04:33.648
- Don't tell me
you don't remember

04:33.690 --> 04:35.191
the story
of "Hansel and Gretel," right?

04:35.233 --> 04:36.735
The witch fattening them up?

04:36.776 --> 04:39.029
- You think Jack Dayton
wants to eat us?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.614
- Guy seems to have
a big appetite.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.870
- Dr. Lieu, you're with me today.
- Sure thing, Dr. Archer.

04:46.911 --> 04:48.413
- Dr. Archer,
we've got one coming down

04:48.455 --> 04:49.539
from the helicopter pad.

04:49.581 --> 04:52.584
Use Baghdad.

04:52.625 --> 04:53.793
What do we got?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.587
- Brandon Thompson,
34-year-old male.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.172
Restrained driver in MVC.

04:57.213 --> 04:58.465
Intubated en route.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.592
500 milliliters of fluid
in the field.

05:00.633 --> 05:03.011
HR 120.
BP stable, 130 over 82.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.221
- What happened?
- Drove his car off road.

05:05.263 --> 05:07.307
Barreled through the woods
until smashing into a tree.

05:07.349 --> 05:09.642
- All right, on my count.
Ready?

05:09.684 --> 05:11.936
One, two, three.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.652
All right.
Lungs are clear.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.654
Bilateral breath sounds.

05:23.448 --> 05:25.200
OK.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.411
Pupils are equal and reactive.

05:28.453 --> 05:29.829
Fast him.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.958
No free fluid.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.627
- Put in an A-line
and blood gas.

05:35.669 --> 05:38.421
Doris, I'm gonna need
a chest and pelvis X-ray

05:38.463 --> 05:40.840
as well as a EKG
and a PanScan.

05:40.882 --> 05:41.883
Got it.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.468
- Must have lost control
of the car.

05:43.510 --> 05:44.844
Wonder why.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.013
- Let's hope he can wake up
and tell us.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.812
- I'm sorry,
we didn't get a chance

05:53.853 --> 05:54.979
to introduce ourselves before.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.981
This is Dr. Cuevas.
I'm Dr. Charles.

05:57.023 --> 05:59.567
- Is now a good time?
- Of course.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.987
Go ahead, Alexander.

06:03.029 --> 06:04.989
What do you say?

06:05.031 --> 06:08.159
I'm sorry.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.120
I was wrong.

06:10.161 --> 06:11.830
I didn't know
what was happening.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.248
Alexander, you know what?

06:13.289 --> 06:15.417
This can be
a very confusing place.

06:15.458 --> 06:17.627
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about, OK?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.921
Are you gonna fix Grandma?

06:19.963 --> 06:23.049
- We're gonna do
our very best.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.803
- Martha, I would like to go
over your X-rays with you.

06:26.845 --> 06:30.432
- Alexander,
maybe you could go get a snack?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.517
- There's some vending machines
in the waiting room.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.852
I can take you.

06:33.893 --> 06:36.146
- There's some money
in my purse.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.662
Thanks for not sharing anything
in front of Alexander.

06:52.704 --> 06:54.914
It's hard for him
knowing I'm in pain.

06:56.499 --> 06:58.877
- Ms. Kittle,
when you fell,

06:58.918 --> 07:01.880
you suffered
an intertrochanteric fracture.

07:01.921 --> 07:03.465
You broke your hip.

07:03.506 --> 07:05.133
Perhaps more concerning,

07:05.175 --> 07:06.968
you've got lytic lesions
on your bones

07:07.010 --> 07:09.262
that are causing areas
of weakness.

07:09.304 --> 07:12.307
- That's probably
because of the cancer.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.269
Stage 4 lymphoma.
It's metastasized to my bones.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.146
Very sorry to hear that.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.773
It is what it is.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.191
I've decided not to treat it,

07:21.232 --> 07:23.818
though I do take medication
for the pain.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.572
The doctors say I might have
only a few more months.

07:27.614 --> 07:29.449
Does Alexander know?

07:29.491 --> 07:32.577
- I'm struggling to find
the right way to tell him.

07:32.619 --> 07:35.080
I understand.

07:35.121 --> 07:38.416
Listen, Martha, you are
gonna need some surgery, OK?

07:38.458 --> 07:39.709
But I want you to know
that we're gonna do

07:39.751 --> 07:41.461
everything we can
to make this workable

07:41.503 --> 07:42.462
for Alexander.

07:42.504 --> 07:43.838
Surgery?

07:43.880 --> 07:45.590
- You're gonna need
to have your hip pinned.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.759
- What's the recovery time
for that?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.512
- At least a month,
but likely longer.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.014
An orthopedic surgeon can give
you a more accurate estimate.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.183
I'll page the ortho resident
on call to come down.

07:55.225 --> 07:57.185
- Don't, please. I can't go
through a surgery like that.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.646
Who will take care
of Alexander?

07:59.688 --> 08:00.980
- There isn't
another family member

08:01.022 --> 08:02.649
who might be able to help?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.859
No, not since he was a baby.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.486
It's always just
been the two of us.

08:06.528 --> 08:09.656
- Right. No friend that
he feels comfortable with or--

08:09.698 --> 08:11.408
You saw how he was earlier.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.868
Blowups like that happen
at least once a day.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.870
No one I know would want
to take that on.

08:15.912 --> 08:17.372
- Then what we're gonna do is
we're gonna appoint

08:17.414 --> 08:18.498
a short-term guardianship.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.667
- Alexander won't listen
to anyone but me.

08:20.709 --> 08:22.460
I'm the only one
who can calm him down.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.671
So no surgery.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.631
Grandma?

08:26.673 --> 08:28.174
Look.
[chuckles]

08:28.216 --> 08:30.468
Can I have it?

08:30.510 --> 08:32.721
Yes, but not before lunch.

08:40.270 --> 08:43.273
- Hi, Sophia.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.315
Are you her mom?

08:44.357 --> 08:45.650
Her swim coach, Cindy.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.068
Her dad should be here soon.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.820
He lives a few hours away.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.905
Sophia goes to St. Joseph Prep
here in the city.

08:50.947 --> 08:51.865
- Oh, the boarding school,
right?

08:51.906 --> 08:53.658
- Mm-hmm.
- OK.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.493
So what's going on, Sophia?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.911
I don't know honestly.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.872
It was the weirdest thing.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.498
- Sophia and her teammates
were practicing

09:00.540 --> 09:01.958
their individual medley races,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.836
and right after Sophia
made her last flip turn,

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
she fell behind all the others.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.049
Then she stopped swimming
altogether.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.009
- I think I felt something
in my chest,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.802
but then I passed out.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.472
OK if I give a quick listen?

09:15.513 --> 09:16.765
Oh, it was terrifying.

09:16.806 --> 09:20.602
I mean, she was just
floating there, face down.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.771
One of the other coaches helped
me get her out of the pool.

09:22.812 --> 09:25.357
And she was unconscious
at first.

09:25.398 --> 09:29.027
And then after a few seconds,
she came to, thank goodness.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.695
- Anything like this
ever happened before?

09:30.737 --> 09:32.280
No, never.

09:32.322 --> 09:34.074
- Sophia is
a fantastic swimmer.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.325
I broke the state record

09:35.367 --> 09:37.452
for the 200-meter breaststroke
last year.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.287
Wow. Impressive.

09:39.329 --> 09:41.706
All right, let's get
a chest X-ray, CBC,

09:41.748 --> 09:44.042
CMP, EKG, and cardiac labs.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.502
And why don't we
get Sophia a gown?

09:45.543 --> 09:49.089
- Hey, is this the hospital
Jack Dayton bought?

09:49.130 --> 09:50.674
It is.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.967
- Any chance
I'll get to see him?

09:53.009 --> 09:55.553
- You're 16 and you keep up
with Jack Dayton?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.055
When Jack Dayton was 16,

09:57.097 --> 09:58.390
he'd already created
the beta version

09:58.431 --> 10:00.850
of what would become
SapphireCash.com.

10:00.892 --> 10:02.852
- You know a lot about him?
- Of course.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.020
I'm a dev.

10:04.062 --> 10:06.106
- Dev?
- Developer.

10:06.147 --> 10:08.566
It's hard not to look up
to somebody like Jack Dayton.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.069
- Unfortunately, I doubt Jack
will make an appearance today.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.071
He's a pretty busy guy.
Sorry.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.989
But we'll get these tests
and figure out what's going on.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.866
- Sound good?
- Mm-hmm.

10:16.908 --> 10:18.952
Yeah.

10:22.831 --> 10:24.582
I swear,

10:24.624 --> 10:27.335
I would never wish Crohn's
disease on my worst enemy.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.504
- The gastric tube
is definitely clogged.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.922
You called it, Roy.

10:30.964 --> 10:34.092
- That's the fourth time
in the last three months.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.885
- Yeah.
You flushing it out?

10:35.927 --> 10:37.721
I've used warm water,

10:37.762 --> 10:40.765
seltzer, soda,

10:40.807 --> 10:42.392
everything short of Drano.

10:42.434 --> 10:44.644
- OK, well, let's upsize
the tube a little bit.

10:44.686 --> 10:48.064
- Come on, Dr. Marcel.
It's a temporary solution.

10:48.106 --> 10:49.691
There's got to be
something better

10:49.733 --> 10:51.443
than this game
of musical tubes.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.403
- Yeah, look, I get
that you're frustrated, Roy,

10:53.445 --> 10:55.572
but we got
to get you nutrition somehow.

10:55.613 --> 10:57.449
You don't understand.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.451
I can't take this.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.037
I need to eat something.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.956
- Look, sadly,
that's not possible anymore

11:04.998 --> 11:07.125
because
of your esophageal strictures.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.002
You won't be able
to get the food down.

11:09.044 --> 11:11.046
- What about
my surgical options?

11:11.087 --> 11:14.007
I read online you can remove
and replace my esophagus.

11:14.049 --> 11:15.550
Can we do something like that?

11:15.592 --> 11:18.261
- Well, if I do that,
I'll need to replace it

11:18.303 --> 11:20.096
by reconstructing
a new esophagus

11:20.138 --> 11:21.806
from a part of your stomach
or intestine.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.767
But it's
a complicated procedure,

11:23.808 --> 11:25.185
especially for you.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.480
Look, you've had a lot
of surgeries over the years,

11:28.521 --> 11:31.107
and all of that resulting scar
tissue makes it very difficult

11:31.149 --> 11:32.817
to find a piece of intestine
that can work.

11:32.859 --> 11:34.402
But you could try, right?

11:34.444 --> 11:35.779
Too much can go wrong.

11:35.820 --> 11:38.740
- How much worse
can it be than this?

11:38.782 --> 11:41.493
You worried you might kill me?

11:41.534 --> 11:42.786
I can't stand the idea

11:42.827 --> 11:45.288
of having
to keep living like this.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.165
[voice breaks]
I'm serious.

11:49.292 --> 11:52.796
I don't know
how much longer I could go on.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.839
I hear you, Roy.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.008
All right, well...

11:57.050 --> 11:59.135
let me have a think on it, OK?

12:02.889 --> 12:04.099
Dr. Dupre, morning.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.393
Can you input that for me?

12:06.434 --> 12:08.853
- Dr. Marcel,
I couldn't help but overhear

12:08.895 --> 12:10.772
you discussing
what sounded to be

12:10.814 --> 12:12.440
like an Ivor Lewis operation

12:12.482 --> 12:15.652
on a Crohn's patient
with a hostile abdomen.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.028
Eavesdropping much?

12:17.070 --> 12:18.655
Not intentionally.

12:18.697 --> 12:22.659
Look, I would love to offer
2.0 services for the operation.

12:22.701 --> 12:24.244
Thanks, but I told him

12:24.285 --> 12:25.787
we're not gonna go
the surgical route.

12:25.829 --> 12:28.540
Roy's Crohn's disease and
adhesions from prior surgeries

12:28.581 --> 12:31.209
make him a very high risk
and poor surgical candidate.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.211
- I think
this is the perfect case

12:33.253 --> 12:35.130
to take advantage
of 2.0's imaging.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.590
If 2.0 is gonna
revolutionize surgery,

12:37.632 --> 12:40.635
this is exactly the kind of
case it should be used on.

12:40.677 --> 12:43.388
- You know, Roy's situation
is very precarious.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.890
I'm not convinced
2.0 can make a difference.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.226
- I understand
your reservations,

12:48.268 --> 12:50.895
but don't you think
it's worth exploring?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.857
<i>[tense music]</i>

12:53.898 --> 12:57.902
<i>* *</i>

12:57.944 --> 12:59.612
[knocks on door]

12:59.654 --> 13:01.239
You must be Sophia's dad.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.657
- Glen Eastman.
I'm sorry I'm late.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.576
I live out in Rochelle.
Got here as soon as I could.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.578
- I'm glad you made it.
I'm Dr. Halstead.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.620
I have your lab results.

13:07.662 --> 13:08.955
I'll step outside.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.041
No, Coach, please stay.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.751
- You're basically family,
Cindy.

13:12.792 --> 13:14.711
She's been a wonderful
influence in Sophia's life

13:14.753 --> 13:15.754
over the past few years,

13:15.795 --> 13:17.589
especially since
I live so far away.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.132
OK.

13:19.174 --> 13:22.427
Well, the good news is your
labs and EKG came back normal.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.179
- Any idea
what did cause this then?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.264
- Not yet,
but I'd like to test Sophia

13:26.306 --> 13:28.308
for something called
Brugada syndrome.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.810
It's a very rare disorder
that causes arrhythmias

13:30.852 --> 13:32.228
or irregular heartbeats,

13:32.270 --> 13:33.813
especially
if someone who has it

13:33.855 --> 13:36.608
overexerts themselves
like you did swimming today.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.109
That sounds serious.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.694
In the very worst cases,

13:39.736 --> 13:41.946
it can cause the heart
to stop altogether.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.156
But there are treatments

13:43.198 --> 13:44.574
that will prevent that
from happening.

13:44.616 --> 13:46.785
That's why I'd like
to do another EKG.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.079
But this time, I'd like
to administer a medication

13:49.120 --> 13:52.665
called procainamide that will
trigger an irregular EKG result

13:52.707 --> 13:55.335
if Sophia does in fact
have Brugada syndrome.

13:56.711 --> 13:59.130
We've got to do it, right?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.299
So we know either way.

14:02.676 --> 14:05.679
- All right, I'll have a nurse
get you set up right away.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.849
Brandon's CT.

14:09.891 --> 14:12.227
He's got a grade 2
splenic crack with no blush.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.853
- All right.
What's your recommendation?

14:13.895 --> 14:16.022
- Track his hemoglobins
over the next 24 hours.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.482
As long as it remains stable,

14:17.524 --> 14:20.110
I don't see any need
for surgical intervention.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.237
He also passed
a spontaneous breathing test.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.072
- Good.
Let's extubate.

14:24.114 --> 14:25.824
Here you go.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.536
Brandon, we're gonna remove
your endotracheal tube now, OK?

14:29.577 --> 14:32.747
- All right, Brandon, I'm
just gonna loosen the strap.

14:35.458 --> 14:37.043
There you go.
Nice and easy.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.128
Breathe.

14:38.169 --> 14:40.630
- [coughing]
- Good job.

14:44.926 --> 14:49.180
- [strained]
Is Tiffany OK?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.182
Tiffany?

14:51.224 --> 14:55.645
- My wife.
Did they bring her here?

14:55.687 --> 14:56.855
I don't understand.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.565
Was she in the car?

14:58.606 --> 14:59.733
Yes.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.735
She's pregnant.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.236
In labor.

15:05.613 --> 15:07.240
Where is she?

15:15.040 --> 15:15.415
.

15:15.457 --> 15:16.791
- Just spoke to the local
fire department on the scene.

15:18.043 --> 15:20.045
I'm afraid they didn't
find anyone else there.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.713
What?

15:21.755 --> 15:23.882
No, I--what are--
what are you saying?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.383
Brandon, are you sure

15:25.425 --> 15:27.218
you're not misremembering
what happened?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.303
I'm not making this up.

15:28.345 --> 15:30.013
She was sitting
right next to me.

15:30.055 --> 15:33.266
I can prove it.
Just--where's my phone?

15:35.643 --> 15:36.770
OK.

15:39.356 --> 15:42.400
Look, this dot on the map
is her cell phone.

15:42.442 --> 15:44.152
That's right by Interstate 55.

15:44.194 --> 15:45.904
That's where I crashed, right?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.697
OK, I'll go back there myself
if I have to.

15:47.739 --> 15:50.033
- Brandon, you're in no shape
to leave the hospital.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.785
- We're gonna get on top
of this. You just sit tight.

15:54.996 --> 15:56.289
Please.

15:59.751 --> 16:02.587
This is what she looks like.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.714
- We'll do everything we can
to find her.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.594
- Doris,
call the Illinois State Police

16:09.636 --> 16:10.804
and the local
sheriff department.

16:10.845 --> 16:14.349
Tell them we've pinned
a possible location.

16:14.391 --> 16:15.600
- I should go out there
to help them.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.769
I have experience
in search and rescue.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.146
- Yeah, but there are
other people for that.

16:20.188 --> 16:21.606
Look, back in Colorado,

16:21.648 --> 16:23.650
hikers would go missing
all the time.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.777
We would have
a designated incident commander

16:25.819 --> 16:27.904
and experienced hasty teams
at the ready

16:27.946 --> 16:30.824
with helicopters and trucks
and commtech.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.618
I'm not sure the local sheriff
has those kind of resources.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.745
Maybe I can make up
for some of that.

16:35.787 --> 16:37.664
- Yeah,
you're not a helicopter.

16:37.706 --> 16:39.958
- But I do have 63 rescues
under my belt.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.751
For Tiffany and her baby

16:41.793 --> 16:43.294
to have
the best chance of survival,

16:43.336 --> 16:45.380
I need to be out there.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.716
I can bring the hospital
to her.

16:50.844 --> 16:51.928
Dr. Asher.

16:51.970 --> 16:54.806
Hmm? What's up?

16:54.848 --> 16:56.808
- There's a pregnant woman
missing out in the woods

16:56.850 --> 16:59.853
and Dr. Lieu here
seems to be convinced

16:59.894 --> 17:01.688
that he needs to join
the search and rescue.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.481
I want you to go with him.

17:03.523 --> 17:06.067
She's reportedly in labor, OK?

17:06.109 --> 17:08.737
63 rescues, huh?

17:08.778 --> 17:10.613
Make Tiffany number 64.

17:13.116 --> 17:15.660
- The stomach is just
too fibrotic and scarred

17:15.702 --> 17:17.662
to manipulate
into an esophagus.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.664
- How about a colonic
interpositioning?

17:19.706 --> 17:22.167
Can you use his colon?

17:22.208 --> 17:24.085
- There's too many strictures
throughout the bowel,

17:24.127 --> 17:25.670
not to mention
the extensive adhesions

17:25.712 --> 17:27.339
we can't see on the scans.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.923
Look, I want this to work.
I do.

17:28.965 --> 17:31.468
I hate that Roy
has to suffer this much,

17:31.509 --> 17:32.677
but I'm not gonna open him up

17:32.719 --> 17:34.387
and risk further damage
to his intestine

17:34.429 --> 17:38.224
without a plan in place, OK?

17:38.266 --> 17:41.686
- Perhaps a better angle
can help.

17:41.728 --> 17:45.774
2.0, show us the digital twin
for patient Roy Tooley.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.151
[whirring]

17:52.489 --> 17:54.741
Based on Roy's charts
and scans,

17:54.783 --> 17:59.579
2.0 has created this twin
that is anatomically identical.

17:59.621 --> 18:02.540
Feel free to poke around
in there.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.708
What do you mean?

18:03.750 --> 18:05.835
- I've enabled a function
with 2.0

18:05.877 --> 18:07.379
that allows you
to manipulate the hologram

18:07.420 --> 18:08.505
using the sensory gloves.

18:08.546 --> 18:11.383
Here, try it.

18:11.424 --> 18:12.717
OK.

18:22.811 --> 18:24.229
OK.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.730
Here we go.

18:28.942 --> 18:33.488
<i>- Area of bowel has previous</i>
<i>intestinal anastomosis.</i>

18:33.530 --> 18:35.323
Neat trick.

18:35.365 --> 18:37.492
<i>But it's just a hologram.</i>

18:37.534 --> 18:39.536
There's no telling how
Roy's body would respond

18:39.577 --> 18:41.162
to any of this in real life.

18:41.204 --> 18:44.207
- 2.0 can simulate
the real-life responses

18:44.249 --> 18:48.003
based on an extensive database
of previous surgical input

18:48.044 --> 18:50.255
while continuously
recalibrating

18:50.296 --> 18:52.549
to incorporate
Roy's personal data as well.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.801
Mm.

18:54.843 --> 18:58.513
- Look, if you're worried
about that little hiccup

18:58.555 --> 19:00.598
where 2.0 questioned
your suturing technique,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.017
it won't happen again.

19:02.058 --> 19:05.103
2.0 is here to assist,
not hinder.

19:05.145 --> 19:07.856
- Well, I guess there's no harm
in running a simulation.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.819
OK, we ready?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.409
OK, it all looks normal so
far, just like the first time.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.578
Push the procainamide.

19:21.619 --> 19:23.538
[machine beeping steadily]

19:25.165 --> 19:28.793
[machines beeping slows]

19:30.503 --> 19:33.798
So see the slope that gradually
descends after each heartbeat?

19:33.840 --> 19:35.800
I don't feel any different.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.093
You're not supposed to.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.596
The medication only changes
the EKG reading

19:39.637 --> 19:41.431
if you have Brugada syndrome.

19:41.473 --> 19:42.724
- So does this mean
Sophia has it?

19:42.766 --> 19:45.518
I'm afraid so, yeah.

19:45.560 --> 19:46.811
A cardiologist
will walk you through it,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.730
but, Sophia,
you're going to need

19:48.772 --> 19:52.025
an implantable cardioverter
defibrillator, an ICD.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.318
What's that?

19:53.360 --> 19:55.528
- It's a device
that monitors your heartbeats.

19:55.570 --> 19:56.654
And if you were to ever have

19:56.696 --> 19:58.031
another
heart-stopping arrhythmia,

19:58.073 --> 20:00.325
it will deliver a very
small shock to your heart

20:00.367 --> 20:01.743
to restore regular rhythm.

20:01.785 --> 20:04.746
It's a procedure typically done
in a cath lab OR,

20:04.788 --> 20:06.456
but after four to six weeks,
Sophia should be able

20:06.498 --> 20:08.875
to resume all normal
activities, including swimming.

20:08.917 --> 20:12.379
- Wait, you mean
I can't swim at all until then?

20:12.420 --> 20:14.130
- You will need
to take a break.

20:14.172 --> 20:16.966
- Um, that's gonna be a problem
for regionals.

20:17.008 --> 20:20.011
If Sophia doesn't compete in
the upcoming meet in two weeks,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.013
she'll be ineligible
for future events.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.808
- That means I won't be able
to compete at state.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.560
Can't we put this surgery off
until later?

20:27.602 --> 20:29.020
- That makes me
a little nervous.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.606
- I agree. It's best to
take care of this right away.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.776
- OK, we'll do it.
- Dad.

20:34.818 --> 20:36.444
- Dr. Halstead is saying
your heart could stop beating.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.488
You don't understand, Dad.

20:38.530 --> 20:41.032
You're not around, and
you hardly come to my meets.

20:41.074 --> 20:43.368
If I don't compete at state,
that screws up my chances

20:43.410 --> 20:45.328
of going out for the Olympics
a year from now.

20:45.370 --> 20:46.996
- I'm sorry, honey.
It's just too risky.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.623
There'll be
plenty more opportunities

20:48.665 --> 20:50.875
for you to compete
in the future.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.502
- Yeah, I will have someone
from cardiology

20:52.544 --> 20:53.628
come speak with you.

20:56.381 --> 21:00.135
- Well, thank you very much.
You've been really helpful.

21:00.176 --> 21:01.636
Huh.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.180
So that's the mayor's office
for people with disabilities

21:04.222 --> 21:07.392
with a very promising referral
for a short-term guardian

21:07.434 --> 21:08.768
who has extensive experience

21:08.810 --> 21:10.103
working with adults
with special needs.

21:10.145 --> 21:11.771
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah.

21:11.813 --> 21:13.690
Hopefully,
Martha will sign off on it.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.191
We need some help in here.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.526
Alexander!

21:16.568 --> 21:18.236
Help him!

21:18.278 --> 21:19.612
What's going on?

21:23.241 --> 21:25.994
OK, he's unresponsive,
and he's not breathing.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.746
Oh, God.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.289
His lips are turning blue.

21:31.666 --> 21:33.251
- Pinpoint pupils.
Did he take something?

21:33.293 --> 21:35.670
- It looks like he's overdosed.
- Do something, please.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.047
Narcan.

21:41.634 --> 21:42.927
[inhales sharply]

21:44.888 --> 21:47.932
- Alexander, are you all right?
You OK?

21:47.974 --> 21:50.060
- What happened?
- You're OK, baby.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.519
You're OK.

21:51.561 --> 21:52.937
I don't feel good.

21:52.979 --> 21:55.231
- You're going to be fine.
Don't worry.

22:04.407 --> 22:04.616
.

22:04.657 --> 22:05.658
- The car crashed
through this fence here.

22:06.910 --> 22:08.661
The car then careened
into the woods

22:08.703 --> 22:12.040
until an oak tree brought it
to a halt right about here.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.291
There was no sign
of a passenger,

22:13.333 --> 22:15.377
so we went ahead
and had it towed.

22:15.418 --> 22:18.630
- Sheriff, I found these
about 100 yards due east.

22:18.672 --> 22:20.340
Those are Tiffany's.

22:20.382 --> 22:21.675
Brandon had the same picture
on his phone.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.927
- Deputy Russell,
this is Dr. Lieu and Dr. Asher.

22:23.968 --> 22:25.720
They treated the driver
at Chicago Med.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.389
[whistles]
Bring over Brix.

22:27.430 --> 22:28.473
Has Brix helped you out

22:28.515 --> 22:30.141
on other search and rescues
before?

22:30.183 --> 22:31.768
- No, but he once found
12 kilos of blow

22:31.810 --> 22:32.811
buried in a local trailer park.

22:32.852 --> 22:34.062
Hopefully, he'll be able

22:34.104 --> 22:35.647
to find a pregnant woman
in the woods.

22:35.689 --> 22:37.607
- Sheriff Parker, we'd like to
head out with the first team.

22:37.649 --> 22:39.609
We can provided
immediate medical support.

22:39.651 --> 22:40.777
Works for me.

22:40.819 --> 22:42.779
First team, let's head out.
Let's go.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.030
Let's grab our supplies.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.911
Here?

22:49.953 --> 22:52.914
<i>- Vascular pedicle</i>
<i>is too short.</i>

22:52.956 --> 22:54.874
This looks promising.

22:54.916 --> 22:56.835
Left colon just past
the splenic flexure.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.878
<i>Tissue is extremely friable.</i>

22:58.920 --> 23:01.464
<i>Many adhesions.</i>
<i>Easy to tear.</i>

23:01.506 --> 23:02.549
Well, it seems 2.0

23:02.590 --> 23:04.050
has already assessed
all my options.

23:04.092 --> 23:06.052
So why don't we just skip
to the part

23:06.094 --> 23:08.263
where it tells me what segment
of the bowel to pull up?

23:08.304 --> 23:09.889
2.0, your recommendation?

23:09.931 --> 23:12.475
<i>- Abort</i>
<i>esophageal reconstruction.</i>

23:12.517 --> 23:14.185
- You're kidding me.
<i>- Place gastric tube</i>

23:14.227 --> 23:16.229
<i>and commit</i>
<i>to liquid enteral nutrition.</i>

23:16.271 --> 23:18.189
- Well, Roy's already
been doing all of that,

23:18.231 --> 23:19.691
so what was the point
of any of this?

23:19.733 --> 23:20.734
Hold on.

23:20.775 --> 23:22.360
2.0, what is the prognosis

23:22.402 --> 23:24.821
of an esophageal reconstruction
with this patient?

23:24.863 --> 23:27.115
48% chance of success.

23:27.157 --> 23:29.868
48%? Those are decent odds.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.995
Why would 2.0 insist
this will fail?

23:32.037 --> 23:33.872
- Well, 2.0 has
a default setting.

23:33.913 --> 23:35.623
Not to support
any surgical procedure

23:35.665 --> 23:38.293
that has less
than a 50% chance of success.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.670
But I am going
to lower that threshold.

23:40.712 --> 23:42.589
You are good to go.

23:43.965 --> 23:46.801
OK.

23:46.843 --> 23:48.928
Here we go.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.889
Starting from square one, 2.0.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.100
<i>- The left colon has</i>
<i>the best odds of viability.</i>

23:54.142 --> 23:58.188
- Yeah, I see it.
Looks pretty good.

24:00.273 --> 24:02.901
Oh.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.236
Yeah, that section
looks long enough.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.906
Seems like
it has adequate blood flow.

24:07.947 --> 24:10.825
- I think
this could actually work.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.744
Yeah.

24:12.786 --> 24:14.579
OK, well, let's do
a couple of practice rounds,

24:14.621 --> 24:18.792
and then we can bring in
the real Roy.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.544
OK, from the top.
Let's go.

24:26.758 --> 24:28.343
Alexander, how are you doing?

24:28.385 --> 24:30.929
- Can I see Grandma now?
- Very soon.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.473
- We want to keep you
on IV fluids,

24:33.515 --> 24:35.934
that tube that's in your arm,
just a little while longer.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.519
Make sure you feel better.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.562
- In the meantime,
we're hoping you can help us

24:39.604 --> 24:41.731
figure out
exactly what happened.

24:41.773 --> 24:43.274
I think I fainted.

24:43.316 --> 24:45.360
- Any idea
why that might have happened?

24:47.320 --> 24:50.573
Can you remember
eating anything different

24:50.615 --> 24:52.742
than you normally do,
like anything at all?

24:52.784 --> 24:54.077
No.

24:54.119 --> 24:56.079
Think real hard, Alexander.

24:56.121 --> 24:57.872
We're here to help you.

24:57.914 --> 24:59.708
I know.

24:59.749 --> 25:01.751
- Alexander, are you, um--

25:01.793 --> 25:02.919
are you a candy person?

25:02.961 --> 25:05.547
- Do you like candy?
- Yes.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.257
- I'm just wondering
if there's any chance

25:07.298 --> 25:08.800
you could have looked
in your grandma's purse

25:08.842 --> 25:11.261
and seen red and blue pills

25:11.302 --> 25:12.721
and thought
that they were candy maybe?

25:12.762 --> 25:15.682
- I don't eat anything
unless Grandma lets me.

25:15.724 --> 25:17.600
I have to ask.

25:17.642 --> 25:20.603
- Like the soda this morning
from the vending machine?

25:20.645 --> 25:21.980
- Uh-huh.

25:22.022 --> 25:24.315
She said I could.
She opened it for me.

25:28.069 --> 25:29.988
- I guess it doesn't matter
what I think.

25:30.030 --> 25:33.116
- We're very sorry,
Mr. Eastman.

25:34.868 --> 25:36.327
What's going on?

25:36.369 --> 25:39.748
- Sophia's refusing
to stop swimming competitively.

25:39.789 --> 25:41.207
She's petitioned a judge

25:41.249 --> 25:43.877
to issue a stay
on her ICD implantation.

25:43.918 --> 25:45.086
Well, how is that possible?

25:45.128 --> 25:47.130
Her father signed off,
and she's a minor.

25:47.172 --> 25:49.632
- She's filing
for emancipation.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.135
- What? She's gonna need
her father's consent, right?

25:52.177 --> 25:53.345
Well, in most cases, yes.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.638
- But she's been
living independently

25:55.680 --> 25:57.807
at her boarding school
these last few years

25:57.849 --> 26:01.394
on a swimming scholarship,
so the court may grant her

26:01.436 --> 26:04.439
emancipation regardless
of what her father wants.

26:04.481 --> 26:05.648
She has a heart disorder,

26:05.690 --> 26:07.692
and you're telling me
a judge is, what?

26:07.734 --> 26:09.027
Gonna let her ignore it?

26:09.069 --> 26:10.820
It's out of our hands now.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.113
We're sorry.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.619
Great. Yeah, OK.

26:17.660 --> 26:18.912
As long as we have

26:18.953 --> 26:21.373
an automated external
defibrillator on standby,

26:21.414 --> 26:23.208
you are OK to compete.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.460
- That another doctor
you were talking to there?

26:25.502 --> 26:27.212
A friend who's in contact

26:27.253 --> 26:30.256
with the state's
competitive committee.

26:30.298 --> 26:33.259
- Sophia, you do realize
the more you exert yourself,

26:33.301 --> 26:34.803
the higher the chances
this happens again?

26:34.844 --> 26:37.263
- Which is why we're looking
into precautionary measures

26:37.305 --> 26:39.140
- that don't require surgery.
- There aren't any.

26:39.182 --> 26:41.017
- I've trained
my whole life for this,

26:41.059 --> 26:42.435
and I'm not about
to throw it all away

26:42.477 --> 26:44.354
just because I passed out once.

26:44.396 --> 26:46.690
- Sophia,
if another arrhythmia occurs,

26:46.731 --> 26:48.608
you may not get the chance
to go to the Olympics.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.068
Dr. Halstead.

26:51.986 --> 26:53.113
You could die.

26:53.154 --> 26:55.073
May I have a word?

26:57.575 --> 26:58.827
Ms. Goodwin,

26:58.868 --> 27:00.620
she's taking medical advice
from a swim coach.

27:00.662 --> 27:02.539
- You need to give
this girl some space.

27:02.580 --> 27:04.290
I don't like it
any more than you do,

27:04.332 --> 27:06.334
but it's time to step away.

27:18.430 --> 27:21.391
- Is Alexander OK?
- He's gonna be.

27:21.433 --> 27:23.852
But, you know, Martha,
there was, um,

27:23.893 --> 27:28.231
a pretty significant amount
of opiates in his bloodstream.

27:28.273 --> 27:30.567
And, you know,
it occurred to me

27:30.608 --> 27:34.029
that given
your stage 4 cancer pain,

27:34.070 --> 27:35.363
it would be
completely understandable

27:35.405 --> 27:39.242
if you were carrying around,
you know,

27:39.284 --> 27:41.286
just a lot of
very strong medicine with you

27:41.327 --> 27:43.121
all the time, right?

27:43.163 --> 27:45.582
And at first,
I thought that maybe--

27:45.623 --> 27:48.793
I don't know, maybe Alexander
was looking in your purse,

27:48.835 --> 27:53.256
and I don't know,
he mistook the medicine

27:53.298 --> 27:56.301
for candy or something.

27:56.343 --> 27:58.595
But then he told me
pretty explicitly

27:58.636 --> 28:01.056
that he never puts anything
in his mouth

28:01.097 --> 28:04.434
without your permission.

28:04.476 --> 28:05.685
So, Martha,
I have to ask you,

28:05.727 --> 28:08.104
did you--

28:08.146 --> 28:11.566
did you put a bunch of pills
in his soda this morning?

28:14.736 --> 28:17.280
- I didn't know
what else to do.

28:17.322 --> 28:19.449
When I got my diagnosis,

28:19.491 --> 28:25.038
I thought if I could just
hold on a little longer,

28:25.080 --> 28:27.290
maybe when he got a bit older,

28:27.332 --> 28:31.795
he could manage by himself.

28:31.836 --> 28:34.881
But then I realized
that was never gonna happen.

28:34.923 --> 28:39.135
- You know, there
are other options, though.

28:39.177 --> 28:40.929
- Martha--
- I've tried them.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.848
I put Alexander
in different group homes,

28:43.890 --> 28:47.727
but he wouldn't eat,

28:47.769 --> 28:50.271
wouldn't sleep.

28:50.313 --> 28:55.777
He'd sob and bang the ground
with his fists until they bled.

28:55.819 --> 28:58.613
Every time,
it was a disaster.

28:58.655 --> 29:02.200
- So you thought
that he would--

29:02.242 --> 29:04.536
he would be better off dead?

29:04.577 --> 29:08.164
- I love Alexander more
than I've loved anybody.

29:08.206 --> 29:11.334
But after I fell this morning,
I couldn't stop thinking,

29:11.376 --> 29:14.587
if I can't be there for him,
who will?

29:14.629 --> 29:17.549
[sobbing]

29:19.384 --> 29:21.261
I'm sorry.

29:21.302 --> 29:25.223
[sniffles]
I'm so sorry.

29:30.228 --> 29:31.771
- It looks like
Brix wants to cross.

29:31.813 --> 29:33.273
[barking]

29:33.314 --> 29:35.942
- Let's split up.
You guys cross.

29:35.984 --> 29:38.778
Dr. Asher and I will stay
on this side, move downstream.

29:38.820 --> 29:41.406
- Cover more ground that way.
- You got it.

29:46.202 --> 29:47.746
So what was that about?

29:47.787 --> 29:50.623
- Brix has been trained
to detect drugs and contraband.

29:50.665 --> 29:52.167
It's not the same skillset

29:52.208 --> 29:55.253
as searching
for a missing person.

29:55.295 --> 29:56.588
I'm just not sure
it makes sense

29:56.629 --> 29:59.257
for Tiffany to cross the stream
in her state.

30:02.469 --> 30:04.387
- All right, see this twig here?
- Yeah.

30:04.429 --> 30:07.057
- How it's broken
about waist level?

30:07.098 --> 30:09.476
You think Tiffany did that?

30:09.517 --> 30:11.853
- It's high off the ground.
Some human did.

30:17.108 --> 30:18.610
Check this out.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.948
- Looks like fresh blood to me.
- Could be Tiffany's.

30:26.201 --> 30:27.744
Sheriff, this is Dr. Lieu.

30:27.786 --> 30:30.163
We've got blood droplets
just off the creek

30:30.205 --> 30:31.956
in grid D5 on the map.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.458
We're marking it off now.

30:33.500 --> 30:34.668
<i>Copy that.</i>

30:34.709 --> 30:37.504
- She's close.
Come on.

30:44.719 --> 30:44.886
.

30:44.928 --> 30:45.720
OK, gonna take the left colon

30:46.805 --> 30:49.391
just up
to the middle colic artery.

30:49.432 --> 30:52.185
<i>- Tissue appears viable.</i>
<i>Adequate blood supply.</i>

30:52.227 --> 30:53.812
OK, good.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.980
I'm gonna resect.
GIA stapler.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.565
Thank you.

31:03.488 --> 31:05.281
Is something wrong?

31:05.323 --> 31:08.952
- Colon looks OK, but the
small bowel looks much better.

31:08.993 --> 31:10.829
It's got
a good vascular pedicle.

31:10.870 --> 31:12.706
Appears more freely mobile.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.499
Might be better
for the reconstruction.

31:14.541 --> 31:18.169
<i>- Small bowel interposition</i>
<i>is not recommended.</i>

31:18.211 --> 31:19.212
Why is that?

31:19.254 --> 31:20.672
- There's no dataset
to guide you.

31:20.714 --> 31:24.050
- I don't need a data set.
I just need a viable bowel.

31:24.092 --> 31:27.637
OK, but first,
let's remove the esophagus.

31:27.679 --> 31:32.308
- Once you take the esophagus
out, there's no turning back.

31:32.350 --> 31:33.977
Scalpel, please.

31:40.442 --> 31:42.110
[elevator dings]

31:42.152 --> 31:43.653
Mr. Dayton, hi.

31:43.695 --> 31:45.405
I'm Will Halstead,
one of the ED docs.

31:45.447 --> 31:46.990
- Sorry. Mr. Dayton's
on a very tight schedule.

31:47.032 --> 31:48.783
- Oh, I understand,
but I have a patient,

31:48.825 --> 31:51.077
a teenager,
who has a heart condition.

31:51.119 --> 31:53.371
She needs a procedure,
and she's refusing

31:53.413 --> 31:55.373
because it'll get in the way
of her competitive swimming.

31:55.415 --> 31:57.792
But I think you might be able
to change her mind.

31:57.834 --> 31:59.294
Why would she listen to me?

31:59.336 --> 32:00.754
She's into computers.

32:00.795 --> 32:03.423
She idolizes you.
I wouldn't be asking otherwise.

32:03.465 --> 32:05.633
- Mr. Dayton, you have to be
in San Francisco by 8:00 p.m.

32:05.675 --> 32:06.801
- I've got
a very important meeting.

32:06.843 --> 32:08.011
It can't be rescheduled.

32:08.053 --> 32:09.262
- All I'm asking for
is a few minutes.

32:09.304 --> 32:10.847
Convincing Sophia
to get this procedure,

32:10.889 --> 32:12.098
it could save her life.

32:12.140 --> 32:13.683
- I appreciate your concern
for your patient,

32:13.725 --> 32:15.101
but I really do
have a plane to catch.

32:15.143 --> 32:16.269
- Why did you even
buy a hospital

32:16.311 --> 32:18.063
if you don't care
about the patients in it?

32:18.104 --> 32:19.147
Excuse me?

32:19.189 --> 32:20.273
- You know,
when you took over Med,

32:20.315 --> 32:21.608
I hoped it might have
something to do

32:21.649 --> 32:22.817
with a desire to help people,

32:22.859 --> 32:24.611
but clearly,
that was naive on my part.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.029
We're nothing to you.

32:26.071 --> 32:27.655
Just another toy to play with.

32:27.697 --> 32:29.240
Have a safe flight.

32:33.661 --> 32:34.996
There.

32:35.038 --> 32:37.165
Tiffany.

32:37.207 --> 32:38.875
Hey, Tiffany.
We're doctors.

32:38.917 --> 32:40.835
- We're here to help you.
- What's happening?

32:40.877 --> 32:42.629
- You were in a car accident.
- [groaning]

32:42.671 --> 32:44.130
She's cold to the touch.

32:44.172 --> 32:46.716
We're gonna put a tarp
under you, OK?

32:48.385 --> 32:49.427
Here we go.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.262
Lift up just a little.

32:51.304 --> 32:53.139
Great job.

32:53.181 --> 32:56.142
OK, I'm gonna
remove your jacket

32:56.184 --> 32:58.019
so we can put a warming blanket
on you.

33:00.814 --> 33:02.315
Sheriff, this is Dr. Lieu.

33:02.357 --> 33:04.984
We've located Tiffany
in grid C7.

33:05.026 --> 33:06.945
Track the orange markers,
and you'll find us.

33:06.986 --> 33:09.864
<i>- Copy.</i>
<i>On our way.</i>

33:09.906 --> 33:12.867
- Tiffany,
I'm gonna examine you, OK?

33:12.909 --> 33:15.203
- Am I bleeding?
- You're in labor.

33:15.245 --> 33:16.538
She's disoriented.

33:16.579 --> 33:19.040
Could be from the head lash
or from hypothermia.

33:19.082 --> 33:21.668
- [grunts]
- Abdomen's hard as a rock.

33:21.710 --> 33:23.169
Most likely placenta abruption.

33:23.211 --> 33:25.588
Baby's not getting
enough blood or oxygen.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.674
- Heart rate 110,
BP 90 over 42.

33:27.716 --> 33:29.259
Hand me the fetal doppler.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.510
Help me.

33:30.552 --> 33:32.762
- It's gonna be OK, Tiffany.
We're trying, OK?

33:32.804 --> 33:34.305
Just hang on in there.

33:38.268 --> 33:39.269
Ooh.

33:39.310 --> 33:41.771
- Baby's heart rate
is down to 80.

33:48.570 --> 33:49.738
She's completely dilated.

33:49.779 --> 33:51.531
- All right.
Hang in there, Tiffany.

33:51.573 --> 33:53.658
- Tiffany, we're gonna need
to deliver your baby right now.

33:53.700 --> 33:54.826
So when I tell you,
you're gonna push

33:54.868 --> 33:56.453
as hard as you can, OK?

34:02.083 --> 34:04.419
May we interrupt?

34:04.461 --> 34:05.754
You OK, Grandma?

34:05.795 --> 34:08.423
I will be.

34:08.465 --> 34:09.799
How about you?

34:09.841 --> 34:12.010
- [sighs] I feel--

34:12.052 --> 34:13.887
I'm feeling better now.

34:13.928 --> 34:15.221
When can we go home?

34:19.017 --> 34:21.269
Alexander...

34:21.311 --> 34:24.064
I-I can't go home.

34:24.105 --> 34:26.858
- You have to.
You live there.

34:26.900 --> 34:30.487
I know, but I'm very sick.

34:30.528 --> 34:32.030
I'll help you get better.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.574
- Oh, baby,
I wish you could,

34:34.616 --> 34:38.119
but I'm the kind of sick
that never gets better.

34:38.161 --> 34:39.829
Then I'll stay here with you.

34:39.871 --> 34:42.040
You can't.

34:42.082 --> 34:44.209
- Why?
Did I do something wrong?

34:44.250 --> 34:46.836
- No. No, you didn't
do anything wrong.

34:46.878 --> 34:48.421
This wasn't your fault at all.

34:48.463 --> 34:52.425
But I'm not able
to care for you anymore.

34:52.467 --> 34:55.762
- Alexander, we're gonna help
you find somebody who can, OK?

34:55.804 --> 34:57.180
You stay out of this.

34:57.222 --> 34:59.974
- Alexander, no.
Listen to me, please.

35:00.016 --> 35:02.102
You need to trust Dr. Charles.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.896
He can help you
in ways that I can't.

35:04.938 --> 35:07.857
But I want you, Grandma.

35:07.899 --> 35:11.361
Alexander, you are so special

35:11.403 --> 35:15.240
and deserve the very best
this world has to offer.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.451
I just can't give that
to you anymore.

35:18.493 --> 35:20.161
Someone else can.

35:21.871 --> 35:25.500
And I'm going to need you
to let them.

35:25.542 --> 35:27.377
Can you do that for me?

35:29.504 --> 35:32.799
I love you, Grandma.

35:32.841 --> 35:37.012
Baby, I love you so much.

35:37.053 --> 35:40.015
I love you with all my heart.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.104
- OK, Tiffany,
we're gonna go again.

35:46.146 --> 35:47.355
- You ready?
- Yeah.

35:47.397 --> 35:48.314
Push.

35:48.356 --> 35:49.649
- [groaning]
- You got it.

35:49.691 --> 35:50.984
- You're doing great, Tiffany.
- Keep pushing.

35:51.026 --> 35:52.152
- You're doing great.
Come on.

35:52.193 --> 35:54.154
- I can't.
I can't.

35:54.195 --> 35:55.488
- Yes, you can.
You're almost there.

35:55.530 --> 35:56.573
I promise.

35:56.614 --> 35:57.907
Here we go again.

35:57.949 --> 35:59.367
Push.

35:59.409 --> 36:01.870
[screams]

36:01.911 --> 36:03.997
Yes.

36:05.040 --> 36:07.667
It's a girl.

36:07.709 --> 36:09.544
You got a little girl.

36:09.586 --> 36:12.547
[baby crying]

36:18.553 --> 36:18.928
.

36:18.970 --> 36:20.263
- Well, Sophia, your discharge
paperwork is complete.

36:22.599 --> 36:23.850
You're free to go.

36:23.892 --> 36:25.185
- [knocks on door]
- Sorry.

36:25.226 --> 36:28.021
Hope this is the right room.

36:28.063 --> 36:29.814
You're Jack Dayton.

36:29.856 --> 36:31.733
You must be Sophia.

36:31.775 --> 36:34.027
Dr. Halstead here tells me
you're quite the swimmer.

36:34.069 --> 36:36.446
- She is.
- She is also a fan of yours.

36:36.488 --> 36:38.114
- Well,
that's very kind of you.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.408
You know, one of the perks
of owning my own hospital

36:40.450 --> 36:41.868
is getting to know
the patients.

36:41.910 --> 36:45.622
So I thought I'd come by
and say hello.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.499
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:47.540 --> 36:49.584
Now you love swimming,
but I also hear

36:49.626 --> 36:52.045
that you have an interest
in computers, right?

36:52.087 --> 36:53.213
Tell me about that.

36:53.254 --> 36:56.049
- Well,
I'll leave you all to talk.

36:56.091 --> 36:58.426
What are you developing?

36:58.468 --> 37:01.971
<i>[hopeful music]</i>

37:02.013 --> 37:05.892
<i>* *</i>

37:05.934 --> 37:08.353
- All right.
We'll take it from here.

37:11.106 --> 37:12.440
Thank you.

37:15.652 --> 37:17.404
Nice work out there.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.705
- Looks like Alexander
and his guardian

37:26.746 --> 37:28.415
are off to a good start.

37:28.456 --> 37:30.792
Yeah, well,

37:30.834 --> 37:33.503
thank God for that anyway.

37:33.545 --> 37:34.879
Yeah.

37:34.921 --> 37:36.965
- I really do appreciate
you stepping in, Mr. Dayton.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.717
She's a smart girl, Sophia.

37:38.758 --> 37:41.094
Glad she changed her mind
about having the procedure.

37:41.136 --> 37:42.470
Yeah, curious.

37:44.389 --> 37:46.266
What did you say
to get through to her?

37:46.307 --> 37:49.853
- Oh, well, it turns out
we have a lot in common.

37:49.894 --> 37:52.230
I told her how I used to be
a bit of an athlete myself.

37:52.272 --> 37:54.983
Basketball was my thing.
But I also loved computers.

37:55.025 --> 37:57.986
So when I messed up my back,
couldn't play for a little bit,

37:58.028 --> 37:59.195
I still had this other passion.

37:59.237 --> 38:01.281
And, well,
it worked out well for me.

38:01.322 --> 38:04.200
I think it gave her
a whole new perspective.

38:04.242 --> 38:07.120
- OK, look,
about what I said earlier--

38:07.162 --> 38:09.914
- No one ever talks to me
like that.

38:09.956 --> 38:11.416
I'd like to apologize.

38:11.458 --> 38:12.917
Save it.

38:12.959 --> 38:14.336
I can respect
a straight shooter,

38:14.377 --> 38:17.339
especially one so committed
to his patients.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.343
Glad to know I have you
on my team, Dr. Halstead.

38:21.384 --> 38:24.346
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have a plane to catch.

38:32.687 --> 38:35.315
- You know, if this week's
contrast study goes well

38:35.357 --> 38:38.485
and shows there are no leaks,

38:38.526 --> 38:43.782
Roy will get to taste food for
the first time in three months.

38:43.823 --> 38:46.034
Man, he is gonna be thrilled.

38:49.287 --> 38:51.539
He has you to thank for that.

38:51.581 --> 38:52.707
No.

If it hadn't been
for you insisting on 2.0,

I don't think
we'd be here right now.

I mean, first Vanessa left.

Now Ben is gone.

Granny knew
what the heck she was doing.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.991
She did.

40:08.033 --> 40:10.410
I'm so glad you enjoyed it.

40:10.452 --> 40:12.412
- Listen, Liliana,
I just want to apologize

40:12.454 --> 40:15.248
if I've been
a little bit glum tonight.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.751
I had a brutal day,
