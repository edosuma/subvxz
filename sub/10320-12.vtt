01:00.662 --> 01:05.125
Tommy, I wrote a new song, trying to see
if it appeals to the youth demographic.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.335
And you're about as youth as they get.

01:08.420 --> 01:09.546
Right? Let's see.

01:10.255 --> 01:11.715
What do you think?

01:13.675 --> 01:15.928
Alright, you are ready for the club, kid!

01:17.220 --> 01:19.389
And here comes the bottle service.

01:20.807 --> 01:22.267
Take your time, Max.

01:22.350 --> 01:24.269
One wrong move and it's all over.

01:24.477 --> 01:26.146
Jengaaa...

01:26.354 --> 01:28.815
I know you're trying
to mess with my head.

01:29.691 --> 01:31.192
And it's working.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.321
Easy, easy...

01:35.405 --> 01:37.532
Nobody move but you...

01:39.701 --> 01:41.536
- No!
- Yes!

01:42.746 --> 01:45.749
J-Money, Jenga Master, wins again!

01:45.958 --> 01:47.876
I can't beat you at anything.

01:48.085 --> 01:50.378
Oh, that's not true.

01:50.587 --> 01:52.005
You always beat me at losing.

01:52.923 --> 01:55.008
Hey! That's right.

01:55.092 --> 01:57.260
Hey! That's mean.

02:01.264 --> 02:02.599
That was kinda mean.

02:03.142 --> 02:05.060
You know, I was in the same boat as Max.

02:05.268 --> 02:07.896
I was the little sister
and your mom beat me at everything.

02:08.104 --> 02:11.399
I know. She's always bragging
about kicking your butt at Twister.

02:12.818 --> 02:15.278
She only won
because she was twice my size.

02:16.029 --> 02:19.574
I couldn't quite get my left foot
on green while my right hand was on red.

02:19.658 --> 02:23.453
Now every time I see a stoplight change,
I can smell that cheap vinyl mat.

02:25.205 --> 02:27.415
Okay. I'm back.

02:27.499 --> 02:29.334
Look, just let Max win sometime.

02:29.542 --> 02:32.378
You mean lose on purpose?

02:32.462 --> 02:34.339
I'm not sure if I could do that
if I tried.

02:35.381 --> 02:37.300
Honestly, I'm that good.

02:37.509 --> 02:39.636
Oh, that's just what
your mother used to say.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.974
I've got my big date
with Steve today.

02:45.100 --> 02:48.103
It's been 20 years since we went out.

02:48.187 --> 02:49.479
I've got butterflies.

02:49.688 --> 02:52.273
- You're watching the kids, right?
- Oh, sure.

02:52.357 --> 02:54.567
In fact, I just had
a nice chat with Jackson

02:54.651 --> 02:57.362
about how the older sister,
I mean brother,

02:57.445 --> 03:01.533
shouldn't take advantage
of the younger sister, I mean brother.

03:03.368 --> 03:05.745
Oh, I get it. This is about Twister.

03:07.247 --> 03:08.999
For the last time,

03:09.082 --> 03:11.417
I beat you because I out-played you,

03:11.501 --> 03:14.295
I out-witted you, I out-Twistered you.

03:15.964 --> 03:17.632
Honestly, I'm that good.

03:19.009 --> 03:21.928
Alright. You. Me.
Twister board. High noon.

03:22.137 --> 03:23.138
I've got a date.

03:23.346 --> 03:25.224
High afternoon.

03:25.724 --> 03:26.641
You're on.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.518
Prepare to get twisted, sister.

03:33.398 --> 03:34.941
Kimmy, what are you doing?

03:35.150 --> 03:38.486
I saw the kids playing Jenga
so I thought I'd try it with lunch meats.

03:39.988 --> 03:42.282
Easy now, easy...

03:42.365 --> 03:43.449
[groans]

03:44.492 --> 03:46.703
Why didn't I pull the pastrami?

03:47.328 --> 03:50.749
Oh, speaking of food,
today's D.J.'s big date with Steve.

03:50.832 --> 03:53.293
- You know I'm Team Steve.
- And I'm Team Matt.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.045
Why? Don't you like Steve?

03:55.254 --> 03:58.090
Oh, no, Steve's great,
I just like rooting against Kimmy.

04:00.466 --> 04:02.427
This thing is just like <i>The Bachelorette.</i>

04:02.635 --> 04:04.804
What? My life is not a reality show.

04:05.013 --> 04:05.847
Are you sure?

04:05.931 --> 04:09.142
You're seeing two guys, going on
a one-on-one date with each of them

04:09.226 --> 04:10.769
and then picking a winner.

04:12.062 --> 04:14.189
Oh, no! I am The Bachelorette.

04:15.857 --> 04:19.152
The way I see it, Matt is the future
and Steve is the past.

04:19.319 --> 04:20.779
Steve's not the past.

04:21.446 --> 04:24.616
Yo, yo, yo. Steve Hale in the house.

04:24.824 --> 04:25.784
Hey, Deej.

04:25.867 --> 04:26.701
[Steve chuckles]

04:27.493 --> 04:29.121
Steve, you look...

04:29.329 --> 04:31.290
Younger? Sexier?

04:31.497 --> 04:35.043
No, no,
I was gonna say "squirrel-nestier."

04:36.086 --> 04:40.548
I'm taking D.J. back to when we were
the hottest couple at Bayview High.

04:40.757 --> 04:42.801
Oh, that sounds like so much fun.

04:43.009 --> 04:45.386
Oh, I should go get a scrunchie

04:45.470 --> 04:47.472
and some shoulder pads.

04:47.555 --> 04:51.143
And a pager in case anyone needs
to reach me in the nineties.

04:54.813 --> 04:56.564
She's gone. You guys, talk to me.

04:56.773 --> 04:59.734
What's happening?
Did she have a good date with Matt?

04:59.943 --> 05:01.486
Nothing to worry about.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.696
Yes!

05:05.615 --> 05:07.408
I've gotta patent this Meat Jenga.

05:08.952 --> 05:11.412
Get it in the stores before Christmas.

05:11.621 --> 05:14.916
Kimmy, it's already in the stores.
It's called the deli section.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.418
Guys. Please. Back to my date.

05:17.502 --> 05:20.297
I know I look super cool
but I'm a nervous wreck.

05:21.089 --> 05:22.715
You can win D.J.'s heart.

05:22.799 --> 05:25.844
You're sweet, you're charming,
you're adorable.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.595
You're Steve Hale, damn it.

05:27.804 --> 05:29.555
I'm Steve Hale, damn it.

05:31.975 --> 05:35.312
I was Bay Area "Podiatrist of the Year"
in 2012.

05:36.229 --> 05:37.063
Hey.

05:37.147 --> 05:38.857
We're on like Donkey Kong.

05:40.192 --> 05:41.818
Look, I found my old slap bracelet.

05:41.901 --> 05:42.944
Nice.

05:45.989 --> 05:50.576
Couldn't find my shoulder pads, though,
so I'm using Huggies instead.

05:51.953 --> 05:54.497
You look totally rad.
Okay, Deej, we're outie 5,000.

05:54.580 --> 05:56.708
I've got Alanis Morissette
bumping in the car.

05:58.710 --> 06:01.087
Do you know who that song
is really about?

06:06.343 --> 06:09.971
Steve's so in love with D.J.
he didn't even notice this sandwich.

06:12.265 --> 06:15.060
Three, two, one...

06:15.268 --> 06:17.103
Hey! Is anybody using that sandwich?

06:18.646 --> 06:19.689
Wow!

06:24.027 --> 06:26.405
Yes, ma'am. Gibbler Style
is offering half off

06:26.612 --> 06:29.699
if you book your baby shower
within six months of your bridal shower.

06:30.783 --> 06:32.869
It's our "Don't Do the Math" special.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.789
Hey! What are you doing here?

06:36.998 --> 06:39.084
I have surprises for you.

06:40.126 --> 06:42.421
A surprising number of surprises.

06:46.466 --> 06:47.508
Whoa!

06:48.301 --> 06:50.262
OMG!

06:50.470 --> 06:51.930
You guys were kissing.

06:52.638 --> 06:54.099
We were not kissing.

06:55.475 --> 06:59.020
Your mother had a piece of popcorn
wedged behind her molar

06:59.104 --> 07:03.108
and I was trying to dislodge it
with my tongue.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.110
Just tell me the truth.

07:05.318 --> 07:08.738
The truth is...
your father's lung collapsed

07:08.821 --> 07:10.531
and I was trying to reinflate it.

07:12.242 --> 07:16.079
We're not going to cute story
our way out of this, are we?

07:16.871 --> 07:21.293
Okay, your papa and I have been doing
a little bit of... canoodling...

07:21.376 --> 07:24.129
With a sprinkling of hanky spanky.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.840
So you guys are really back together?

07:28.049 --> 07:30.551
My birthday wish came true!

07:32.929 --> 07:37.142
I'm gonna tweet all my friends about it.
Fernimmy is back.

07:37.350 --> 07:38.477
Fernimmy?

07:38.684 --> 07:41.062
Fernando plus Kimmy equals Fernimmy.

07:42.939 --> 07:45.024
Sounds better than Fergibbler.

07:47.319 --> 07:50.280
Look at us. We even have a couple name.

07:50.489 --> 07:53.408
We are just like Brangelina.

07:54.826 --> 07:57.078
Only we are much better-looking.

07:58.163 --> 07:59.914
Didn't you have a surprise for me?

08:00.081 --> 08:01.124
Ah.

08:01.207 --> 08:06.421
I have a very special day planned
that could change all of our lives.

08:06.505 --> 08:09.215
You are going on a, how do you say...

08:09.299 --> 08:11.551
[speaks in American accent]
...scavenger hunt?

08:14.554 --> 08:16.473
Wow. That's exactly how you say it.

08:18.224 --> 08:22.020
[speaks in his normal Spanish accent]
In my head, it sounded like gibberish.

08:23.271 --> 08:25.273
Here's your first clue.

08:26.358 --> 08:28.234
"This magical journey begins

08:28.318 --> 08:32.655
in the room that housed
the Katsopolis twins."

08:34.991 --> 08:38.744
[gasps] It's beautiful!

08:39.745 --> 08:41.581
Oh, Fernando!

08:41.664 --> 08:42.957
You should have.

08:47.462 --> 08:51.132
Come on, Max, you can do this.

08:51.966 --> 08:53.552
See the tower?

08:55.053 --> 08:56.471
Be the tower.

08:59.765 --> 09:01.226
Tower, stay.

09:03.728 --> 09:05.522
Good tower!

09:08.774 --> 09:12.153
Wow, Max. You really put me
in a tough spot here.

09:13.154 --> 09:17.992
Jengaaa, Jackson. Jackson, Jengaaa.

09:23.582 --> 09:26.000
Oh, no!

09:31.089 --> 09:33.883
[shrieks] I did it! I beat Jackson!

09:34.092 --> 09:36.052
Alright! Way to go, Max.

09:36.261 --> 09:38.597
And that's how you Jenga, punk.

09:40.306 --> 09:43.309
I'm the greatest of all time!

09:43.518 --> 09:45.103
Ali, <i>bomaye.</i>

09:45.311 --> 09:46.521
Ali, <i>bomaye.</i>

09:51.984 --> 09:53.027
[Max chuckles]

10:00.159 --> 10:01.536
Ask me where I'm going.

10:01.744 --> 10:02.745
Where are you going?

10:02.954 --> 10:04.956
[shrieks] I'm going to Disneyland!

10:08.084 --> 10:09.461
Last time I ever let him win.

10:10.753 --> 10:12.046
I heard that.

10:14.173 --> 10:15.550
You lost on purpose?

10:15.758 --> 10:18.303
No, no, no, no, no,
you beat me fair and square.

10:18.511 --> 10:22.390
I should've known when you knocked
over the tower on your first move.

10:23.433 --> 10:26.561
I'm sorry, Max. It was my idea.

10:26.769 --> 10:28.896
You didn't think I could beat him?

10:29.105 --> 10:31.524
Well, you are
on a seven-year losing streak.

10:33.526 --> 10:34.944
Can I rephrase that?

10:35.153 --> 10:37.905
No, I get it. I am a loser.

10:39.449 --> 10:40.700
Max, where are you going?

10:40.908 --> 10:43.035
Not to Disneyland.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.788
[sighs] I'm going to Loserland.

10:50.585 --> 10:51.877
Max? Where are you?

10:55.214 --> 10:56.508
You guys are back early.

10:56.716 --> 10:59.594
Well, it didn't go exactly as planned
but it was still fun.

10:59.802 --> 11:03.473
Yeah, Steve took me to the school gym
to recarve our initials in the bleachers.

11:03.556 --> 11:06.476
But apparently, security frowns
on a grown man in a wig

11:06.559 --> 11:08.978
wandering the halls with a pocket knife.

11:10.605 --> 11:13.941
After we got kicked out of our old
high school, we went to our secret beach.

11:14.025 --> 11:16.319
Which is now a nude beach
for senior citizens.

11:17.529 --> 11:20.573
That was the most disturbing
volleyball game I've ever seen.

11:20.657 --> 11:23.242
But it's all good
because you know what we're gonna do?

11:23.326 --> 11:26.454
We'll move the picnic to the backyard.
I'll make my famous burgers.

11:26.663 --> 11:29.457
Oh, those are great. I love those.
Make mine medium rare.

11:30.166 --> 11:32.210
I'm sorry, it's kind of a date.

11:32.418 --> 11:34.962
Oh, but we'll save you one
if there's extra.

11:35.171 --> 11:36.255
There won't be.

11:38.007 --> 11:40.760
Oh, okay, alright, fine.
I gotta go find Max.

11:40.968 --> 11:41.802
He's not lost.

11:42.011 --> 11:45.640
We were just playing a little game
called "Max, where the heck are you?"

11:45.848 --> 11:47.808
Max, where the heck are you?

11:49.686 --> 11:51.854
- She's so good with the kids.
- Right?

11:52.063 --> 11:53.439
Oh, yeah!

11:53.648 --> 11:56.442
"Your paws and claws
are in for good news.

11:56.651 --> 11:59.278
Go to where Ramona
keeps her shoes."

12:02.198 --> 12:04.325
[gasps] Mrs. Pham!

12:06.327 --> 12:08.246
It's mani-pedi time!

12:10.456 --> 12:13.251
"If your muscles are sore,
open the other door."

12:15.127 --> 12:18.089
Ah! Magic Fingers Boris!

12:18.297 --> 12:19.716
Ta-da!

12:20.717 --> 12:23.803
Mani-pedi, massage...
You thought of everything.

12:23.886 --> 12:24.721
I sure did.

12:27.181 --> 12:29.601
"I know that you can find this taxing

12:29.684 --> 12:32.645
but grit your teeth,
it's time for a waxing."

12:36.107 --> 12:37.191
Doris!

12:37.858 --> 12:39.527
Before you start ripping out hairs,

12:39.611 --> 12:42.739
I'd like to apologize
for the names I'm about to call you.

12:44.949 --> 12:45.866
[laughs nervously]

12:46.075 --> 12:47.243
Max!

12:48.369 --> 12:50.538
- Are you in the dog house?
- [Max] No!

12:51.831 --> 12:54.250
I mean, woof.

12:55.585 --> 12:56.795
Hey! Come on out, buddy.

12:58.588 --> 13:00.715
I'm even a bad hider.

13:00.799 --> 13:03.008
That's how big of a loser I am.

13:03.718 --> 13:05.177
You're not a loser.

13:05.261 --> 13:06.721
You're just not a winner.

13:08.097 --> 13:10.725
I'm really not good at this.

13:11.392 --> 13:14.312
Why can't I ever beat Jackson at anything?

13:15.020 --> 13:17.898
Because you're the little brother
and he's the big brother.

13:18.107 --> 13:20.401
It's a classic Wahlberg scenario.

13:22.027 --> 13:23.571
What's a Wahlberg?

13:24.739 --> 13:27.366
Donnie Wahlberg was the star
of New Kids on the Block.

13:27.450 --> 13:29.869
He dominated his little brother
Marky Mark.

13:29.952 --> 13:33.289
Then one day, Marky Mark put on
a pair of Calvin Klein underwear

13:33.372 --> 13:36.626
