that ID is real,

If we do this by the book,
maybe the cops
lock the parents up.

We shine a light
on this thing,
her community gets scared,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.787
and maybe the next girl
doesn't need our help.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.656

of the girl

07:35.723 --> 07:37.390

when she was 2

to do that

11:32.525 --> 11:33.927

The jejunum is part
of the small intestine

11:37.097 --> 11:38.665
between the duodenum
and ileum.

11:38.732 --> 11:42.903

very dangerous surgery.

if it's successful,

11:44.637 --> 11:47.607
post-operative complications
are frequent and serious.

11:47.674 --> 11:50.010

very painful.

He'll be healthy?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.483
He would still need
chemotherapy

how good the doctor is.

But when your mortality rate
is as low as Atkinson's,

13:20.567 --> 13:22.502
it means you're
turning away patients.

13:22.569 --> 13:24.604
You turn away patients,
it means you lack confidence.

They were watching Mara
while we were on vacation.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.172

been horrified.

to a doctor?

24:02.942 --> 24:05.645
That girl's sex organs
were covered with scar tissue.

She had no medical attention
to treat any of her wounds.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.930
My mother was cut.
Her mother was cut.

It is a rite of passage
connecting our women
to their ancestors.

She will not find a husband

someone else.

These parents forfeited
the right to make any calls

a long time ago.

Our daughter
is an honor student,

24:40.446 --> 24:43.650
taking three AP classes
in her junior year,

24:43.716 --> 24:46.653
went on a mission to Haiti
to build a school.

24:46.719 --> 24:48.187
We have raised her well.

24:49.756 --> 24:50.990
She is a good person.

24:52.825 --> 24:54.260
We're proud of her.

24:55.427 --> 24:58.497
I'm sure
she is a good person.

24:58.565 --> 24:59.966
But you are not gonna
convince me

25:00.032 --> 25:02.068
that what happened to Mara
when she was 2 years old

25:02.134 --> 25:04.503
is anything short
of an abomination.

25:04.571 --> 25:06.505
But that's not
the issue today.

25:06.573 --> 25:09.508
The issue is, how do we
best help this girl now?

25:11.177 --> 25:14.080
The clitoral reconstruction
should protect
the exposed nerve.

25:14.146 --> 25:15.381
ZANE: "Should"?

25:15.447 --> 25:17.750
That is the surgery that,
in my medical opinion,

25:17.817 --> 25:18.985
is called for.

25:19.051 --> 25:20.653
But it's not
the only option?

25:22.488 --> 25:24.691
We could oblate
the peripheral nerves

25:24.757 --> 25:26.893
and remove the remaining
clitoral tissue.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.729
And is that surgery safer
or more dangerous?

25:29.796 --> 25:31.731
It's simpler, but that's not
the only factor here.

25:31.798 --> 25:34.533
It's the only factor to us.

25:34.601 --> 25:36.703
We want to know
that our daughter

25:36.769 --> 25:39.806
won't spend the rest
of her life in pain.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.240
Please.

25:41.307 --> 25:42.809
For a moment,

25:42.875 --> 25:45.645
can we think about something
other than Mara's pain?

25:46.813 --> 25:48.915
Can we think
about her pleasure?

25:48.981 --> 25:51.450
We have a chance
to give her

25:51.517 --> 25:54.320
a healthy,

Yesterday, she was requesting
cosmetic surgery.

Today, you're asking her
to risk a lifetime of pain

at pleasure.

26:13.505 --> 26:15.041

I've heard,

26:15.107 --> 26:17.009
she's mature enough
to make the call herself,

for a few minutes to do so.
