WEBVTT

02:10.755 --> 02:13.424
Ser Ryam was a strong Lord Commander

02:13.508 --> 02:15.051
of the Kingsguard.

02:16.344 --> 02:18.304
But he was ill for some time.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.014
He passed in peace, I hope.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.057
Yes, Your Grace.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.392
He was found to have passed

02:22.392 --> 02:24.310
gently in his sleep.

02:24.394 --> 02:27.730
His remains are being prepared
by the Silent Sisters.

02:27.814 --> 02:31.150
The succeeding Lord Commander,
Ser Harrold,

02:31.234 --> 02:35.530
would like to make haste in finding
Ser Ryam's replacement on the Kingsguard.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.615
Your Grace. My lords.

02:38.283 --> 02:41.161
The Kingsguard must soon be restored
to its full complement of seven.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.997
With the help of the Hand,

02:43.997 --> 02:46.583
I've invited a number of
fine candidates to court.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.543
All have passed fair trials.

02:52.797 --> 02:54.716
Four ships have now been lost.

02:54.716 --> 02:56.134
The last one was flying my banner.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.137
The Stepstones have now
grown into a conflagration,

02:59.137 --> 03:01.681
yet you sit here
and dither about court business.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.933
If you've something
to discuss, Lord Corlys--

03:04.017 --> 03:05.810
I want to know what is to be done

03:05.894 --> 03:07.979
about my ships and my men.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.272
The Crown will compensate you

03:09.272 --> 03:11.482
for your ship and crew,
and make an offering

03:11.566 --> 03:14.652
- to the men's families.
- I don't want compensation.

03:16.779 --> 03:19.157
I want to seize the Stepstones by force

03:19.157 --> 03:20.700
and burn out this Crabfeeder.

03:20.700 --> 03:23.703
I am not prepared to start
a war with the Free Cities.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.497
These pirates are not the Free Cities.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.667
Who do you think provides them
with their ships and tender?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.961
In all of its history, my lord,

03:32.045 --> 03:33.922
the Seven Kingdoms have never entered

03:33.922 --> 03:35.715
open war with the Free Cities.

03:35.715 --> 03:37.425
Were that to happen,

03:37.425 --> 03:40.303
the losses would be incalculable.

03:44.307 --> 03:47.226
What reason does
the Crabfeeder have to fear us?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.398
The King's own brother has been allowed
to seize Dragonstone

03:52.482 --> 03:55.485
and fortify it with an army
of his gold cloaks.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.154
Daemon has squatted there
for over half a year

03:58.154 --> 04:00.198
without even a protest from The Crown.

04:00.198 --> 04:03.076
I'll caution you, Lord Corlys,

04:03.076 --> 04:06.663
a seat at the King's table
does not make you his equal.

04:10.166 --> 04:11.584
I have acted, Corlys.

04:12.919 --> 04:15.922
I've sent envoys to Pentos and Volantis

04:15.922 --> 04:17.840
to see if we might find common cause.

04:18.675 --> 04:21.010
Ships and men are at the ready.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.223
The Stepstones will be settled in time.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.101
You have dragonriders, father.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.733
Send us.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.908
It isn't that simple, Rhaenyra.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.535
It would be a show of force.

04:46.160 --> 04:48.121
At least the Princess has a plan.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.502
- I only meant that we should at least--
- Perhaps,

04:54.502 --> 04:58.756
there's some better use
for the Princess's talents, Your Grace.

05:01.509 --> 05:03.720
Why don't you take the Princess
to see about the new

05:03.720 --> 05:05.430
Kingsguard posting, Lord Commander?

05:07.306 --> 05:08.766
A fine idea, Your Grace.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.438
This knight will protect you as well.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.064
You should choose.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.754
Ser Desmond Caron,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.131
a fine knight, Princess.

05:40.131 --> 05:42.133
Step forward, Ser Desmond.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.137
Son of Ser Royce Caron,

05:46.137 --> 05:48.765
Ser Desmond has proved strong and steady

05:48.765 --> 05:51.768
in both the tourney lists and without.

05:51.768 --> 05:54.687
While traveling through the Kingswood
on his way to King's Landing,

05:54.771 --> 05:57.732
Ser Desmond recently brought
a would-be poacher

05:57.732 --> 05:58.941
to justice.

06:09.744 --> 06:13.206
You might thank him
for his leal service, Princess.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.417
We thank you for your loyal
service to The Crown, ser.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.014
Ser Rymun Mallister.

06:32.433 --> 06:35.353
Son of Lord Lymond Mallister of Seagard.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.480
Winner of the melee at Cider Hall.

06:37.980 --> 06:40.775
He was the last mounted
of three-and-twenty knights.

06:40.775 --> 06:42.902
Ser Rymun was knighted at eight-and-ten.

06:42.902 --> 06:45.071
Do any of these knights
have combat experience?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.241
Beyond capturing poachers.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.376
Ser Criston Cole.

07:04.423 --> 07:07.343
Son of the steward
of the Lord of Blackhaven.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.305
Be welcome, Ser Criston.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.893
You saw combat in the Stormlands.

07:15.977 --> 07:18.146
Dornish marches, Princess.

07:18.146 --> 07:21.357
I fought for a year as a foot solider
against the Dornish incursions.

07:22.483 --> 07:24.443
Ser Arlan Dondarrion
knighted me after we razed

07:24.527 --> 07:26.445
two of the watchtowers along the Boneway.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.828
I choose Ser Criston Cole.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.415
Let's not be too hasty, Princess.

07:38.624 --> 07:41.711
There's no doubt Ser Criston
is a fine warrior,

07:41.711 --> 07:44.255
but houses such as Crakehall and Mallister

07:44.255 --> 07:46.924
are important allies of The Crown.

07:47.008 --> 07:49.719
Seagard, for instance,
is the realm's prime defense

07:49.719 --> 07:51.470
against reavers from the Iron Islands.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.097
Those men are tourney knights.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.975
My father should be defended by a man
who's known real combat.

07:58.811 --> 07:59.937
Should he not?

08:02.231 --> 08:04.066
Of course, Princess.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.694
Well, let us plan Ser Criston's
investiture then.

08:15.203 --> 08:18.122
The Valyrian capital
was built into a volcano,

08:18.206 --> 08:19.707
much like Dragonstone.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.794
And the dragonlords,
the highest of the nobility,

08:23.878 --> 08:26.797
lived here, at the volcanic face,

08:26.881 --> 08:30.051
closest to the source
of their magic and power.

08:30.051 --> 08:31.928
And this was the Anogrion.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.224
Where the bloodmages worked their craft.

08:38.893 --> 08:41.103
It is truly wondrous what you've built.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.146
Oh no.

08:43.522 --> 08:47.068
I only pore over the histories
and provide the plans.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.445
The stonemasons built the structures.

08:49.946 --> 08:52.823
Do you believe that Westeros
can be another Valyria, Your Grace?

08:52.907 --> 08:55.076
That depends,
whether you speak of the Freehold

08:55.076 --> 08:57.078
at its height or at its fall.

08:58.579 --> 09:00.248
Over a thousand dragons,

09:00.248 --> 09:03.251
a navy large enough to span
the seas of the world.

09:06.504 --> 09:09.423
The glory of Old Valyria
will never be seen again.

09:10.675 --> 09:12.218
Seven Hells.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.860
Tell me, how is Rhaenyra?

09:30.569 --> 09:32.238
- What do you mean?
- Well, these days,

09:32.238 --> 09:34.657
she doesn't say more
than a few words to me.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.243
I think she might find it difficult

09:38.619 --> 09:40.538
to discuss personal matters.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.499
It will take time.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.545
It did when I lost mine own mother.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.845
I wish she would approach me.

09:57.513 --> 09:58.764
What if you went to her?

09:59.765 --> 10:01.559
There are times when I would rather face

10:01.559 --> 10:04.687
the Black Dread himself
than mine own daughter of 15.

10:07.857 --> 10:10.776
I think she would open
herself to you if invited.

10:11.819 --> 10:15.156
You do have such an easy way about you,
Your Grace.

10:19.327 --> 10:22.288
You do not mention our talks to Rhaenyra,
do you?

10:24.749 --> 10:25.875
I just,

10:27.293 --> 10:29.378
I fear that she wouldn't understand them.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.714
No, Your Grace.

10:45.311 --> 10:48.022
It's only been half a year
since my mother died,

10:48.022 --> 10:50.107
and already they tried
to marry my father off

10:50.191 --> 10:52.360
and replace me as heir.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.487
I know those men and how they plot

10:54.487 --> 10:57.782
in their secret councils
when I've been sent away.

10:57.782 --> 11:01.410
You cannot worry at the matters
of lords and kings, Rhaenyra.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.414
What if your father were to remarry?

11:14.131 --> 11:16.050
Your father loves you.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.141
He chose you for his heir.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.895
He didn't choose me. He spurns Daemon.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.081
Kneel with me.

12:04.223 --> 12:06.767
I find this is a way to be with my mother.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.479
Here in the quiet of the Sept,

12:11.939 --> 12:13.482
I feel close to her.

12:18.863 --> 12:22.408
- I know it sounds foolish.
- I don't think it's foolish.

12:23.659 --> 12:25.578
- I don't.
- Good.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.000
Because I thought you might try.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.882
If not for me, then, perhaps for them.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.367
What do I say?

13:06.202 --> 13:07.745
Whatever you wish.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.165
It's only for you and the gods to know.

13:46.075 --> 13:49.245
I want him to see me as
more than his little girl.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.209
Mine own father does not know
the language of girls either.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.215
When I wish to talk with him,

14:02.258 --> 14:04.385
I know that I must make the effort.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.098
Thank you.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.404
Your Grace.

14:23.404 --> 14:24.780
I'm glad we could meet.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.199
I know tempers ran hot today,

14:27.283 --> 14:29.368
and I wanted to assure you
how much I value the bond

14:29.368 --> 14:30.995
between our houses.

14:31.537 --> 14:34.081
Rhaenys is my favorite cousin after all.

14:35.624 --> 14:38.586
I wish to apologize for the tenor

14:38.586 --> 14:40.963
at the Small Council today, Your Grace.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.631
It was not my intent to make offense.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.511
Your fleet is one of the realm's
most important assets, Lord Corlys.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.722
But you must understand,

14:49.722 --> 14:52.224
as King, it is my obligation to avoid war

14:52.308 --> 14:54.518
until such time it is unavoidable.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.729
None among us desire open war.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.691
Might I speak plainly, Your Grace?

15:02.109 --> 15:05.487
I always welcome the unfettered thoughts
of my council.

15:05.571 --> 15:09.908
I fear that the eyes of our enemies
are presently fixed on the Red Keep.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.286
The Queen has passed.

15:12.286 --> 15:14.455
A girl has been named
heir to the Iron Throne,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.415
the first in its history.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.042
The King's brother, so disinherited,

15:18.042 --> 15:20.252
has claimed the Targaryen seat
on Dragonstone

15:20.336 --> 15:21.879
without challenge.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.507
And now, a foreign power
has established a colony

15:25.591 --> 15:27.718
in our most critical shipping lane.

15:29.053 --> 15:32.556
You paint such an aspirant portrait
of my reign, Lord Corlys.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.558
It is an honest one, cousin.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.771
At the moment, The Crown is perceived
as being vulnerable.

15:39.730 --> 15:41.649
And a blind incursion in the Stepstones

15:41.649 --> 15:43.984
is the only way to demonstrate
that we are not?

15:44.068 --> 15:47.613
To elude a storm,
you can either sail into it,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.281
or around it.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.825
But you must never await its coming.

15:53.285 --> 15:56.038
Do you have a specific
course of action to propose,

15:56.038 --> 15:57.748
my lord?

16:00.209 --> 16:02.044
Join our families.

16:02.878 --> 16:04.505
Wed our daughter, Laena.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.800
Unite the two great surviving
Valyrian houses.

16:07.800 --> 16:11.095
With the Targaryen dragons
and the Velaryon fleet bound in blood,

16:11.095 --> 16:12.638
you can show the realm

16:12.638 --> 16:15.474
that The Crown's strongest days are ahead,

16:15.474 --> 16:16.642
not behind.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.148
I must admit,

16:23.857 --> 16:25.776
I haven't given marriage much thought.

16:26.568 --> 16:28.862
It hasn't even been half a year
since Aemma passed.

16:28.946 --> 16:32.491
The realm expects you to take a new wife
soon or late, Your Grace,

16:32.491 --> 16:35.703
to strengthen your line
and produce more heirs.

16:35.703 --> 16:38.914
You could not ask for
a stronger match than Laena.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.111
We haven't spoken much

17:11.864 --> 17:13.073
since.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.203
A regret of mine.

17:19.913 --> 17:23.500
We should be free to speak our minds
to one another.

17:23.584 --> 17:25.127
You can say whatever you'd like.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.920
You are the King.

17:35.137 --> 17:39.141
I loved your mother very much.

17:42.478 --> 17:43.771
As did I.

18:00.078 --> 18:03.248
Ser Harrold provided
a fine field of tourney knights.

18:03.332 --> 18:04.458
Oh?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.419
But in questioning them,

18:07.503 --> 18:10.130
I discovered that Ser Criston
was the only man among them

18:10.214 --> 18:12.341
with true battle experience.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.719
He'll make a fine
knight of the Kingsguard.

18:21.225 --> 18:24.812
- Today at Small Council--
- Pay it no mind.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.689
- I thought I might have had some insight.
- You're young.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.942
You will learn.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.303
This is our best chance
to save the digit, Your Grace.

19:00.430 --> 19:02.516
The maggots will remove the dead flesh

19:02.516 --> 19:05.144
and hopefully stop the advance of the rot.

19:11.024 --> 19:13.735
I held an audience earlier today

19:13.819 --> 19:15.988
with Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.240
That was most charitable
of you, Your Grace.

19:18.240 --> 19:21.201
I'm sure Lord Corlys
appreciated the spirit of it.

19:21.702 --> 19:23.620
He proposed a marriage.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.291
To whom, Your Grace?

19:28.041 --> 19:29.585
The Lady Laena.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.504
To combine the strength of our houses,

19:32.588 --> 19:35.841
and demonstrate my reign's
strongest days are ahead,

19:35.841 --> 19:37.009
not behind.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.469
Lord Corlys has overreached, Your Grace.

19:40.304 --> 19:43.765
Such matters must be discussed
with the Small Council.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.560
That is what I'm doing, presently.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.648
So, what is your advice, dear Otto.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.318
The Lady Laena

19:55.277 --> 19:57.863
is young, Your Grace.

19:57.863 --> 20:01.158
Indeed, but the wounds
made by the Great Council

20:01.158 --> 20:03.160
still linger, my King.

20:03.160 --> 20:06.496
A match with their daughter
would go a long way towards

20:06.580 --> 20:08.582
sealing the breach

20:08.582 --> 20:11.543
and uniting the two great Valyrian houses

20:11.627 --> 20:15.088
would certainly signal unity
throughout the realm

20:15.172 --> 20:16.673
and beyond.

20:17.424 --> 20:19.801
The Grand Maester's reasoning is sound.

20:21.678 --> 20:23.472
I do fear what Rhaenyra might think.

20:23.472 --> 20:25.474
What does it matter, Your Grace?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.893
Her mother has passed.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.354
Her father must propagate the royal line.

20:37.444 --> 20:41.365
I dearly loved my own lady wife.

20:42.491 --> 20:45.410
The pain of her passing still haunts me.

20:47.204 --> 20:49.122
And to be compelled to

20:50.374 --> 20:52.918
replace her for duty's sake.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.213
You are the King.

20:57.339 --> 20:59.257
But I do not envy you.

21:28.161 --> 21:30.706
What was it like flying the Black Dread?

21:30.706 --> 21:33.667
You were Balerion's last rider.

21:34.251 --> 21:37.421
Only for a short time before he died.

21:37.421 --> 21:38.547
With Balerion

21:38.547 --> 21:41.216
died the last memory of Valyria of Old.

21:42.217 --> 21:43.969
But Vhagar still lives

21:44.594 --> 21:46.179
somewhere.

21:46.263 --> 21:48.181
Bit too large for the Dragonpit.

21:48.807 --> 21:51.351
Some would say too large for our world.

21:52.310 --> 21:55.397
- Do you know where she nests?
- I'm sorry?

21:55.397 --> 21:57.482
Do you know where Vhagar is now?

21:57.566 --> 22:00.277
The Dragonkeepers believe she made home

22:00.277 --> 22:02.779
somewhere on the coast of the Narrow Sea.

22:02.863 --> 22:06.491
The workers at Spicetown report
hearing her song at times.

22:06.575 --> 22:08.702
They say it is a sad thing.

22:10.579 --> 22:12.456
I imagine even dragons get lonely.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.420
Your Grace,

22:19.671 --> 22:21.631
it would be a great honor

22:21.715 --> 22:25.886
to join our houses
as they were in Old Valyria.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.179
I would give you many children

22:27.179 --> 22:29.181
of pure Valyrian blood

22:29.181 --> 22:31.433
so that we might strengthen the royal line

22:31.433 --> 22:33.018
and the realm.

22:33.018 --> 22:35.270
Is that what your father told you to say?

22:40.358 --> 22:41.818
What did your mother tell you?

22:43.779 --> 22:46.907
That I wouldn't have to bed you
until I turned 14.

23:14.392 --> 23:15.811
It bothers you, does it not?

23:21.733 --> 23:23.276
My father is a king.

23:23.985 --> 23:27.239
It is his duty to take a new wife
and strengthen his line.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.532
I did not ask for a lesson in politics.

23:28.532 --> 23:29.991
I asked whether this bothers you.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.409
Laena is your daughter, Princess.

23:31.493 --> 23:33.161
Does it bother you?

23:34.454 --> 23:35.580
Of course, it does.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.669
But I understand the order of things.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.798
I'm not sure you do.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.804
If you mean to elicit some anger from me,

23:50.804 --> 23:53.640
you should know that
you're failing, Princess.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.101
Quite the opposite.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.189
Whether it's to my daughter
or to someone else's,

24:01.273 --> 24:04.192
your father will remarry sooner than late.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.612
His new wife will produce new heirs,

24:07.696 --> 24:10.574
and chances are better than not
that one of those will be male.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.243
And when that boy comes of age
and your father has passed,

24:13.243 --> 24:16.204
the men of the realm
will expect him to be heir,

24:16.288 --> 24:17.622
not you.

24:20.208 --> 24:22.127
Because that is the order of things.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.840
When I'm Queen, I will create a new order.

24:28.425 --> 24:30.552
How I wish that could be, Rhaenyra.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.805
But the men of the realm
already had their opportunity

24:33.889 --> 24:36.224
to appoint a ruling queen
at the Great Council

24:36.308 --> 24:37.809
and they denied it.

24:37.893 --> 24:40.770
They denied you, Princess Rhaenys.

24:41.771 --> 24:43.732
"The Queen Who Never Was."

24:44.482 --> 24:47.277
But they bent the knee to me
and called me heir to the throne.

24:47.277 --> 24:50.322
Do you remind your father's men of that
as you carry their cups?

24:54.868 --> 24:56.828
Here is the hard truth,

24:56.912 --> 25:00.081
which no one else has
the heart to tell you.

25:00.957 --> 25:04.628
Men would sooner put
the realm to the torch

25:04.628 --> 25:07.631
than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.

25:12.510 --> 25:15.096
And your father is no fool.

25:28.944 --> 25:32.530
The Small Council is urging me to remarry.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.910
It seems the realm wants for a new queen.

25:42.123 --> 25:45.627
A good and kind queen
will give comfort to your subjects.

25:50.715 --> 25:54.261
Does the Small Council
have a particular lady in mind?

25:56.179 --> 26:00.850
Lord Corlys Velaryon has offered
the hand of his daughter,

26:00.934 --> 26:02.477
the Lady Laena.

26:03.603 --> 26:05.522
A very strong match, Your Grace.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.735
I must admit,
I don't know Laena very well.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.947
I'm sure that she is good and kind,

26:13.947 --> 26:17.575
and that she will enjoy your company,
as I have, Your Grace.

26:33.133 --> 26:34.676
I brought you something.

26:55.322 --> 26:57.365
I asked the stonemasons to mend it.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.330
This is

27:03.330 --> 27:06.207
a very kind gesture, Alicent.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.589
Very kind.

27:19.721 --> 27:21.556
Come.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.144
The Hand, Your Grace.

27:30.565 --> 27:33.943
Your Grace, I've called the Small Council
to an emergency session.

27:34.027 --> 27:34.944
Why?

27:36.363 --> 27:38.698
I think it best you hear it directly.

27:40.116 --> 27:41.242
Very well.

28:12.273 --> 28:15.110
- Daemon.
- The Prince left a missive,

28:15.110 --> 28:17.195
which I believe might explain.

28:18.321 --> 28:21.032
"It is the pleasure of Daemon Targaryen,

28:21.116 --> 28:22.909
"the Prince of Dragonstone

28:22.909 --> 28:26.913
"and rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

28:26.913 --> 28:29.749
"to announce that he is
to take a second wife

28:29.833 --> 28:32.752
"in the tradition of Old Valyria.

28:32.836 --> 28:37.924
"She is to assume the title
Lady Mysaria of Dragonstone.

28:37.924 --> 28:39.968
"Her Grace is with child

28:39.968 --> 28:45.223
"and is to have a dragon's egg
placed in the babe's cradle

28:45.223 --> 28:48.601
in the custom of House Targaryen."

28:48.685 --> 28:52.313
The Prince has invited you
to his wedding, Your Grace.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.526
- It is in two days' time.
- Gods be good.

28:56.526 --> 28:58.611
Who is Lady Mysaria?

28:58.695 --> 29:00.405
- We believe--
- Daemon's whore.

29:02.949 --> 29:06.119
- This is nothing less than sedition.
- I strongly agree, sire.

29:06.119 --> 29:08.329
My brother wishes to provoke me.

29:09.122 --> 29:11.082
To answer is to give him what he wants.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.460
The realm is watching, Your Grace.

29:13.460 --> 29:15.086
What would you have me do?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.088
Send him to the Wall?

29:17.714 --> 29:19.716
Perhaps I could put his head on a spike.

29:19.716 --> 29:21.676
Daemon has seized Dragonstone,

29:21.676 --> 29:24.512
has surrounded himself
with an army of gold cloaks,

29:24.596 --> 29:26.681
and has now stolen a dangerous weapon.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.628
Assemble a detachment, Otto.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.756
I will go to Dragonstone
and drag Daemon back

29:59.756 --> 30:02.133
- to face justice myself.
- Your Grace.

30:03.468 --> 30:05.678
My apologies, Your Grace,
but I cannot allow it.

30:05.762 --> 30:07.347
It's too dangerous.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.349
Daemon is without limit.

30:10.391 --> 30:12.477
Let me go to Dragonstone.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.798
You're the most comely girl at court.

30:42.757 --> 30:44.884
Why do you destroy yourself?

30:51.307 --> 30:53.434
Will you see the King tonight?

30:56.396 --> 30:57.730
If you wish it.

31:01.109 --> 31:04.070
- Good day, Ser Criston.
- My Lady.

31:04.070 --> 31:07.156
I've assembled 20 of your best
household guards, my Lord Hand.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.367
Sir Harrold will also join us.

31:13.663 --> 31:16.583
Please look after the Hand, Ser Criston.

32:36.663 --> 32:38.790
Welcome to Dragonstone, Otto.

32:41.250 --> 32:44.253
Your occupation of this island
is at an end.

32:45.421 --> 32:47.423
You're to relinquish the dragon's egg,

32:47.507 --> 32:48.966
disband your army,

32:49.050 --> 32:50.843
banish your whore,

32:52.095 --> 32:54.681
and leave Dragonstone
by order of His Grace,

32:54.681 --> 32:57.183
- King Viserys.
- Where is the King? I don't see him.

32:57.183 --> 33:01.062
His Grace would never lower himself
to entertain such a mummer's farce.

33:06.484 --> 33:08.152
Ser Crispin, wasn't it?

33:08.236 --> 33:09.779
Ser Criston Cole, my Prince.

33:09.779 --> 33:11.948
Yes, apologies. I couldn't recall.

33:12.448 --> 33:14.992
Perhaps my Prince recalls
when I knocked him off his horse.

33:17.245 --> 33:18.204
Very good.

33:18.204 --> 33:21.207
This is a truly pathetic show, Daemon.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.126
Are you so desperate
for the King's attention

33:23.126 --> 33:25.837
that you've resorted to skulking about
like a common cutpurse?

33:25.837 --> 33:28.423
I'm simply keeping with
the traditions of my house,

33:28.423 --> 33:30.341
the same as my brother did for his heir.

33:30.425 --> 33:33.302
Those traditions are for the trueborn
children of royalty,

33:33.386 --> 33:36.097
not for bastards fathered
on a common whore.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.766
Lady Mysaria is to be my wife.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.226
This is an abomination.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.145
With every breath you soil your name,

33:42.145 --> 33:44.021
your house, and your brother's reign.

33:44.105 --> 33:47.233
Our love does not know
titles and traditions.

33:48.609 --> 33:50.903
And what of you, men of the City Watch?

33:50.987 --> 33:52.488
Aiding the Prince in his treason?

33:52.572 --> 33:54.532
The King made me their commander.

33:54.532 --> 33:55.950
They are loyal to me.

33:57.034 --> 33:58.953
You've come for the egg.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.706
Here it is.

34:03.207 --> 34:05.084
Are you mad?

34:05.168 --> 34:07.920
- You'd never survive this.
- Well, happily, neither would you.

34:09.172 --> 34:14.051
To chose violence, here,
is to declare war against your King.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.261
Wonderful.

34:16.637 --> 34:19.849
Even if it ends in the death
of your unborn child and its mother?

34:58.888 --> 35:00.014
All of you,

35:00.681 --> 35:02.600
sheathe the fucking steel.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.962
- What are you doing here, Princess?
- Preventing bloodshed.

36:12.962 --> 36:16.048
Ser Criston, please escort
the Princess to safety.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.009
Take care not to startle Syrax, my lords.

36:18.759 --> 36:20.469
She's rather protective of me.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.939
I'm right here, Uncle,

37:15.107 --> 37:17.026
the object of your ire,

37:17.777 --> 37:20.655
the reason that you were disinherited.

37:20.655 --> 37:23.032
If you wish to be restored as heir,

37:23.032 --> 37:24.659
you'll need to kill me.

37:25.952 --> 37:27.078
So, do it.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.539
And be done with all this bother.

39:23.319 --> 39:26.155
You announced that we were to be wed?

39:27.406 --> 39:28.949
On the morrow.

39:30.659 --> 39:32.578
And that I was with child.

39:33.454 --> 39:35.039
Your child.

39:35.039 --> 39:38.375
Well, perhaps when we are wed,
we can make that true.

39:38.459 --> 39:42.421
I ensured long ago that I would never be
threatened by childbirth.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.341
Good. Children can be such
irritating creatures.

39:45.341 --> 39:48.010
You swore to protect me, Daemon.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.348
Dragonstone is quite secure.

39:54.433 --> 39:58.938
Until the King decides to reclaim
his ancestral seat.

39:58.938 --> 40:01.774
His men might not put
the Prince's head on a spike,

40:01.774 --> 40:04.110
but what would they do
with the common whore

40:04.110 --> 40:06.862
he claims he's taken to wife
and made with child?

40:06.946 --> 40:08.489
No one will harm you.

40:09.698 --> 40:13.994
I have been sold as property
more times than I care to count,

40:14.078 --> 40:17.498
beginning in a homeland
I can no longer recall.

40:18.791 --> 40:22.128
Most of my years have been spent
living in terror.

40:23.003 --> 40:25.005
You're safe with me, I swear it.

40:25.089 --> 40:26.465
You are Targaryen.

40:26.549 --> 40:29.718
You can afford to play
your stupid games with the King,

40:29.802 --> 40:31.720
but I cannot.

40:32.805 --> 40:37.518
I didn't come into your service
wanting gold or power

40:37.518 --> 40:39.728
or station.

40:39.812 --> 40:43.566
- I came to you to be liberated.
- Liberated.

40:46.694 --> 40:47.862
From what?

40:49.196 --> 40:50.322
Fear.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.268
No, please, Lord Lyonel.

41:25.232 --> 41:28.027
I have come looking for
an unencumbered opinion.

41:28.027 --> 41:30.571
That's all I would ever give, Your Grace.

41:31.530 --> 41:35.075
Ever since my name was read
by the archmaesters at the Great Council,

41:35.159 --> 41:38.537
I have felt Corlys Velaryon's
envious gaze staring at me

41:38.621 --> 41:40.164
from across the Blackwater.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.543
You sit upon the highest seat
in the realm, Your Grace.

41:44.627 --> 41:46.962
Proud men don't like having to look up.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.927
Laena Velaryon.

41:54.345 --> 41:57.723
Lord Corlys is your Master of Ships

41:57.723 --> 42:01.602
and she is the eldest daughter
of the wealthiest house in the realm.

42:01.602 --> 42:05.439
She comes from
unimpeachable Velaryon stock

42:05.439 --> 42:08.150
and she has Targaryen blood.

42:08.234 --> 42:11.111
- What's to mislike?
- She is 12.

42:11.195 --> 42:12.738
She will mature.

42:15.282 --> 42:16.867
I never asked to remarry.

42:17.576 --> 42:20.704
As King, you have a claim on all things.

42:21.664 --> 42:23.123
Even those you don't want.

42:23.207 --> 42:26.210
Marriage is not an obligation
you can put off for long.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.921
What if I was to reject
Lord Corlys's proposal?

42:28.921 --> 42:31.257
He would not be like to take it well.

42:31.840 --> 42:35.636
I fear nothing short of a direct line
to the Iron Throne would satisfy him.

42:36.470 --> 42:39.181
You should also consider
that we find ourselves

42:39.265 --> 42:41.350
on the precipice of war in the Stepstones.

42:42.393 --> 42:45.312
And the Sea Snake holds claim to nearly
half the realm's ships.

42:45.396 --> 42:48.440
He would not dare withhold them
in the face of the realm's need.

42:49.858 --> 42:53.195
- Who is he to hector me?
- No one, Your Grace.

42:54.780 --> 42:58.784
But Driftmark makes for a better ally
than it does an enemy.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.454
The Sea Snake has made a calculated reach,

43:02.538 --> 43:04.665
a fair play for a man of his position.

43:07.126 --> 43:09.503
If you truly want my unencumbered opinion.

43:09.503 --> 43:10.587
I do.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.133
You should wed Laena Velaryon, Your Grace.

43:15.259 --> 43:18.721
Sate Lord Corlys and fix him at your side,

43:18.721 --> 43:20.639
permanently, as an ally.

43:25.394 --> 43:26.770
Your Grace,

43:26.854 --> 43:29.857
the Princess has returned
from Dragonstone.

43:29.857 --> 43:31.608
Dragonstone?

43:51.587 --> 43:52.713
Your Grace.

43:56.717 --> 43:58.886
You disobeyed me.

43:58.886 --> 44:02.973
You fled King's Landing without a word

44:03.057 --> 44:06.602
and you acted without The Crown's leave.

44:09.772 --> 44:11.940
You are my only heir.

44:13.192 --> 44:15.110
You could've been killed.

44:18.739 --> 44:20.115
May I sit?

44:31.585 --> 44:33.879
You went to Dragonstone.

44:33.879 --> 44:36.006
And retrieved the egg without bloodshed.

44:38.342 --> 44:41.470
A feat I'm not sure Ser Otto
could've accomplished alone.

44:44.598 --> 44:46.475
Yes, well,

44:51.313 --> 44:53.857
I sometimes forget
how alike you both were.

45:04.243 --> 45:08.414
Your mother's absence
is a wound that will never heal.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.166
Without her,

45:11.917 --> 45:16.422
the Red Keep has lost a warmth
that I dare say it will never recover.

45:16.422 --> 45:19.633
It pleases me to hear you say this.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.141
To know that I'm not alone in my grief.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.643
I wish I had known better

45:29.643 --> 45:31.937
what to say to you in the aftermath.

45:34.398 --> 45:38.318
I struggled to realize that my daughter
had so quickly become a woman grown.

45:42.406 --> 45:43.949
But I know

45:44.658 --> 45:48.287
she understands
what is now expected of me.

45:48.287 --> 45:50.789
The King must take a new wife.

45:55.961 --> 45:58.088
I could never replace your mother.

46:00.382 --> 46:02.634
No more than I intend
to replace you as heir.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.638
But you are my only heir

46:06.722 --> 46:09.892
and our line is vulnerable,
too easily ended.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.103
And by marrying again,
I may begin to ensure

46:13.187 --> 46:14.730
that we are better defended.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.898
Against whom?

46:15.898 --> 46:18.108
Whomever may dare to challenge us.

46:24.823 --> 46:27.367
I do not wish to make us estranged.

46:28.285 --> 46:29.703
You are the King,

46:30.287 --> 46:33.874
and so, your first duty is to the realm.

46:36.960 --> 46:38.879
Mother would've understood this.

46:41.590 --> 46:43.133
Just as I do.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.015
Good morrow, my lords.

47:43.277 --> 47:46.822
I have decided to take a new wife.

48:05.257 --> 48:06.925
I intend to marry

48:13.599 --> 48:15.726
the Lady Alicent Hightower

48:17.686 --> 48:19.605
before spring's end.

48:26.403 --> 48:27.988
This is an absurdity.

48:29.156 --> 48:31.950
My house is Valyrian,

48:32.034 --> 48:34.161
the greatest power in the realm.

48:35.537 --> 48:37.456
And I am your King.

49:01.980 --> 49:03.523
Rhaenyra.

49:25.921 --> 49:29.466
House Velaryon's origins
reach back to Old Valyria.

49:31.551 --> 49:34.096
More ancient even than House Targaryen

49:36.056 --> 49:37.974
according to some texts.

49:39.476 --> 49:42.062
But unlike the Targaryens,

49:42.062 --> 49:44.064
we were no dragonlords.

49:45.691 --> 49:49.986
For centuries, my house had to scratch out
an existence from the sea

49:50.070 --> 49:52.614
with grit and luck.

49:54.908 --> 49:57.244
When I ascended the Driftwood Throne,

49:58.495 --> 50:00.038
I knew what I wanted.

50:02.124 --> 50:04.042
So I went out and seized it.

50:05.711 --> 50:07.087
Unlike every other lord of the realm,

50:07.087 --> 50:10.215
I can say that I built
my house's high seat

50:10.215 --> 50:12.426
with the strength of mine own back.

50:19.057 --> 50:21.727
I've always thought of
you and I as having been

50:21.727 --> 50:23.562
made from the same cloth.

50:32.571 --> 50:35.407
I wasn't aware you had
a king for a brother.

50:35.407 --> 50:38.910
We're both men who have had to cut
our own way through the world.

50:39.870 --> 50:42.789
We've been passed over too often.

50:45.667 --> 50:46.877
Did you call me to Driftmark

50:46.877 --> 50:49.337
to remind me of my
low standing, Lord Corlys,

50:49.421 --> 50:51.339
or was there some other reason?

50:55.177 --> 50:57.304
You've heard of the troubles
in the Stepstones?

51:00.515 --> 51:04.561
<i>Some Myrish Prince
is feeding Westerosi sailors to the crabs.</i>

51:04.561 --> 51:07.314
<i>I have been petitioning
the King to send my navy</i>

51:07.314 --> 51:09.107
<i>into the territory,</i>

51:09.191 --> 51:11.109
but he's denied me.

51:11.193 --> 51:13.612
It was never my brother's strongest trait.

51:13.612 --> 51:14.654
What?

51:16.198 --> 51:17.616
Being King.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.498
<i>The Crabfeeder is backed
by powerful entities</i>

51:24.498 --> 51:28.126
<i>within the Free Cities who wish to see
Westeros weakened.</i>

51:30.295 --> 51:33.882
<i>And the King's failures
have allowed him to accumulate strength.</i>

51:35.759 --> 51:38.720
If those shipping lanes fall,

51:38.804 --> 51:40.722
my house will be crippled.

51:41.640 --> 51:43.934
And I will not have Driftmark
beggared while our King

51:43.934 --> 51:47.521
idles himself with feasts,
and balls, and tourneys.

51:47.521 --> 51:50.524
I will speak of my brother as I wish.

51:52.484 --> 51:53.985
You will not.

51:57.405 --> 51:59.199
Waiting in the Stepstones

51:59.199 --> 52:01.409
is a chance for you to prove your worth

52:01.493 --> 52:03.787
to any who might yet doubt it.

52:05.497 --> 52:08.041
We are the realm's second sons, Daemon.

52:09.584 --> 52:11.503
Our worth is not given.

52:13.129 --> 52:15.048
It must be made.
