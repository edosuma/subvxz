00:15.955 --> 00:17.905
<i>Previously on "Imposters"...</i>

00:17.905 --> 00:20.325
You're in way, way over your heads.

00:20.361 --> 00:22.441
You're gonna get the
hell out of Seattle,

00:22.476 --> 00:23.495
because if you don't,

00:23.530 --> 00:25.731
I am quite literally a dead person,

00:25.766 --> 00:28.467
and then all of you
are not far behind me.

00:28.502 --> 00:29.701
Who the hell are you?

00:29.737 --> 00:30.902
Uh, Federal Borough of Investigation.

00:30.938 --> 00:32.237
Did you say "Borough"?

00:32.273 --> 00:33.672
We just want our money.

00:33.707 --> 00:35.340
Are you willing to destroy your mother

00:35.376 --> 00:36.975
and bring down Bloom Boot & Heel

00:37.011 --> 00:38.510
in one fell swoop?

00:38.545 --> 00:41.266
And are you going to be
able to live with yourself

00:41.301 --> 00:42.381
when your hometown finds out

00:42.416 --> 00:45.984
that you threw that interception
on purpose to beat the spread?

00:46.020 --> 00:47.085
Poor Jules.

00:47.121 --> 00:49.488
Do not go there.

00:49.523 --> 00:50.555
Don't threaten us, I'm telling you.

00:53.894 --> 00:55.260
We were never going to run.

00:55.296 --> 00:58.196
You need to stop saying "we."

00:58.232 --> 00:59.598
Maxy?

00:59.633 --> 01:01.333
Rules of the game, Sal.

01:01.368 --> 01:04.001
You knew 'em. You broke 'em.

01:04.038 --> 01:05.837
Chin up, Max.

01:05.873 --> 01:07.806
It's better to be sad than dead.

01:10.444 --> 01:12.878
<i>Dad had a heart attack.
You need to come home.</i>

01:14.518 --> 01:16.484
Saffron Keyes, will you marry me?

01:16.520 --> 01:19.254
No. I have a counter-proposal.

01:19.289 --> 01:21.256
Let's run away together.

01:21.291 --> 01:23.925
- Patrick's in the FBI.
- No, he isn't!

01:23.960 --> 01:25.427
<i>I followed him to the
goddamn headquarters,</i>

01:25.462 --> 01:27.262
<i>looked down on the goddamn seal,</i>

01:27.297 --> 01:30.598
<i>and it said Federal goddamn
Bureau of Investigation.</i>

01:30.634 --> 01:32.000
Wait. What?

01:32.035 --> 01:34.002
We need you back, like, now.

01:34.037 --> 01:35.036
Okay, okay.

01:37.307 --> 01:38.914
<i>What am I doing here again?</i>

01:39.101 --> 01:41.109
Well, some information
has come to our...

01:41.144 --> 01:43.311
<i>More importantly,
what are you doing here?</i>

01:43.346 --> 01:44.946
Wasn't Max clear?

01:44.981 --> 01:48.016
Danger for you. Danger for me.

01:48.051 --> 01:50.618
Leave Seattle.
Not that hard to understand.

01:50.654 --> 01:52.520
You know, we didn't have to
come here and tell you this.

01:52.556 --> 01:54.622
We could've just left
town with you in jeopardy.

01:54.658 --> 01:56.858
I'm aware of the risks
of my job, thanks.

01:56.893 --> 01:58.827
Yeah. A different kind of jeopardy.

01:58.862 --> 02:00.662
Yeah, that puts us in jeopardy, too.

02:00.697 --> 02:02.363
Legally, maybe.

02:02.399 --> 02:04.132
- Probably.
- Definitely.

02:04.167 --> 02:07.202
So, we decided that whether
you deserve our help or not,

02:07.237 --> 02:10.205
not telling you would make
us as unethical as you,

02:10.240 --> 02:11.473
- which we're not.
- Indeed.

02:11.508 --> 02:13.041
That's right. Ethics, Google it.

02:13.076 --> 02:16.077
So, we're gonna tell you, okay?

02:18.882 --> 02:20.882
Patrick's in the FBI.

02:25.021 --> 02:27.355
What... what is that supposed to mean?

02:27.390 --> 02:29.157
Which word didn't you understand?

02:29.192 --> 02:30.558
So much for true love.

02:30.594 --> 02:34.129
Patrick is the Federal...

02:34.164 --> 02:36.664
He's a Federal agent in the FBI.

02:36.700 --> 02:39.968
You really think I wouldn't
be able to figure it out

02:40.003 --> 02:41.636
if Patrick was in the FBI?

02:41.671 --> 02:43.004
Current circumstances would suggest

02:43.039 --> 02:44.372
that no, in fact, you would not.

02:44.407 --> 02:45.840
Because you have not.

02:45.876 --> 02:48.243
Because it's wrong. It's not possible.

02:48.278 --> 02:50.011
Oh, you just know him so well?

02:50.046 --> 02:52.614
You guys are what, soul mates?

02:53.784 --> 02:56.751
Okay. This is ridiculous.

02:56.787 --> 02:58.186
Bye-bye, kids. I suggest you all...

02:58.221 --> 03:00.054
Just shut up for a second and listen.

03:00.090 --> 03:04.325
I followed Patrick into the
Seattle headquarters of the FBI,

03:04.361 --> 03:07.729
where he used his f...ing badge
to go through security.

03:07.764 --> 03:10.198
And then I saw his little sister
Gina and Auntie What's-Her-Face

03:10.233 --> 03:11.499
with their badges,

03:11.535 --> 03:14.502
dressed like legit freaking FBI agents.

03:28.919 --> 03:31.052
Awful, isn't it,

03:31.087 --> 03:32.620
when you invest yourself,

03:32.656 --> 03:34.289
give yourself over to something,

03:34.324 --> 03:37.058
and then learn you've been deeply,
deeply betrayed?

03:37.093 --> 03:39.460
Uh, I-I need to get out of, um...

03:39.496 --> 03:41.396
We think we can help, okay?

03:41.431 --> 03:43.064
- Uh...
- My parents have a house

03:43.099 --> 03:44.065
in upstate New York.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.067
I need to go to the bathroom.

03:46.102 --> 03:48.069
Be right back.

03:58.849 --> 04:01.282
You really enjoyed that, didn't you?

04:01.318 --> 04:03.051
I didn't enjoy it.

04:03.086 --> 04:05.119
I kind of did...

04:05.155 --> 04:07.589
till the end when she got, you know...

04:07.624 --> 04:09.991
Yeah, totally freaked out
and panicky and sad?

04:10.026 --> 04:12.060
Yeah. Not cool, guys.

04:12.095 --> 04:14.596
We decided to tell her,
and now she knows.

04:14.631 --> 04:17.298
Her feelings got hurt?
Welcome to the club.

04:17.334 --> 04:19.500
Yeah, welcome to the club.

04:19.536 --> 04:21.636
Are you ready to order?

04:21.671 --> 04:23.805
Or are you waiting on your friend?

04:24.533 --> 04:26.140
We're gonna wait on our friend.

04:26.176 --> 04:27.775
Yeah, thank you.

04:32.482 --> 04:34.282
Oh, no. Oh, shit.

04:34.317 --> 04:35.950
What? Where are you going?

04:36.361 --> 04:37.552
What?

04:40.624 --> 04:42.190
Shit...

04:42.225 --> 04:44.692
shit...

04:44.728 --> 04:46.728
shit.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.742
Taxi!

05:40.583 --> 05:42.183
Sea-Tac Airport, please.

05:42.218 --> 05:43.518
You got it.

05:55.298 --> 05:57.031
<i>My name's Patrick, by the way.</i>

05:57.067 --> 05:59.434
Come on, why don't you sit
with me for a minute?

05:59.469 --> 06:01.069
My sister, Gina.

06:01.104 --> 06:03.204
This beautiful young lady
here is my Auntie Colleen.

06:03.239 --> 06:05.106
<i>Auntie, this is my friend Saffron.</i>

06:05.141 --> 06:07.675
<i>You are the most incredible,</i>

06:07.711 --> 06:09.777
<i>fascinating woman I've ever met,</i>

06:09.813 --> 06:13.581
<i>and I know a life with you
would be exciting</i>

06:13.616 --> 06:16.250
<i>and fulfilling and beautiful,</i>

06:16.286 --> 06:18.953
<i>and I know that we would
laugh every single day</i>

06:18.989 --> 06:20.788
<i>for decades.</i>

06:20.824 --> 06:25.026
Saffron Keyes, will you marry me?

06:32.068 --> 06:33.768
Excuse me?

06:35.171 --> 06:37.405
Change of plan.

06:57.627 --> 06:59.427
Babe?

06:59.462 --> 07:01.429
Babe, you home?

07:27.223 --> 07:29.424
Hi, there.

07:29.459 --> 07:31.359
Oh, damn.

07:31.394 --> 07:32.960
You scared me.

07:32.996 --> 07:34.996
Surprised?

07:36.332 --> 07:37.832
Happily.

07:37.867 --> 07:39.500
That's a good kind.

07:39.536 --> 07:41.836
Yeah, it is.

07:41.871 --> 07:43.337
Thought you were at work.

07:43.373 --> 07:45.840
I really needed a personal day.

07:45.875 --> 07:47.875
Oh, lucky me.

07:47.911 --> 07:49.544
Damn right, lucky you.

07:56.886 --> 07:57.852
Oh.

08:01.057 --> 08:02.390
Patrick.

08:13.870 --> 08:18.072
I don't think they're gonna let me
wear white at our wedding after that.

08:20.210 --> 08:23.945
- What?
- Our traditional wedding.

08:25.515 --> 08:29.050
Patrick,

08:29.085 --> 08:31.719
will you marry me?

08:35.424 --> 08:36.823
Really?

08:39.895 --> 08:43.297
Nothing would make me happier.

08:46.236 --> 08:48.870
Oh, babe.

08:49.536 --> 08:51.239
It's a lot.

08:51.274 --> 08:52.907
I know.

08:57.947 --> 09:00.781
You know, I think something's missing.

09:27.410 --> 09:29.977
I can't wait to make you my wife.

09:32.615 --> 09:35.716
I can't wait to be your wife.

09:52.817 --> 09:54.533
Steroid bullshit.

09:55.987 --> 09:58.587
Ah, we didn't even need
your bat last night, Simons.

09:58.623 --> 10:01.056
Gina picked up your slack,
and I put Mark on first.

10:01.092 --> 10:03.526
- No errors, baby.
- Ha, pickin' machine.

10:03.561 --> 10:05.461
Always like a W. Good work, guys.

10:05.496 --> 10:07.029
It was all in the coaching.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.964
Guess who got engaged last night?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.132
- Whoa.
- Wait, what?

10:10.168 --> 10:12.268
Yep. It's on.

10:12.303 --> 10:14.303
- Damn.
- I knew it.

10:15.306 --> 10:16.572
Thank you, sir.

10:16.607 --> 10:18.807
Way to bury the goddamn lead, agent.

10:18.843 --> 10:20.743
Well, it's a team effort.

10:20.778 --> 10:24.446
Okay, phase two.
Mark, new schedule and budget.

10:24.482 --> 10:26.048
Okay, everybody, listen up.

10:26.083 --> 10:28.484
Let's go. All right.

10:28.519 --> 10:32.162
The pattern post-wedding:
usually 20 to 30 days,

10:32.197 --> 10:34.352
so we should be within weeks

10:34.387 --> 10:35.891
of taking the Doctor down.

10:35.927 --> 10:40.296
And then we'll go back and
clean up this little guy.

10:40.331 --> 10:41.564
Yes? All right.

10:41.599 --> 10:42.998
Uh, when's the wedding?

10:43.034 --> 10:44.567
She said sooner the better.

10:44.602 --> 10:46.969
Then her eyes got all sparkly.

10:47.004 --> 10:48.337
Dollar signs, of course.

10:49.448 --> 10:50.339
Of course.

10:53.377 --> 10:55.844
You brought the f...ing Feds
to the Doctor's door?

10:55.880 --> 10:57.580
Hey, this is not on me.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.615
All your research and you
couldn't find out anything?

10:59.650 --> 11:01.317
Don't give me your shit.
The doctor vetted him.

11:01.352 --> 11:02.952
- Yeah, see? Exactly!
- I don't know

11:02.987 --> 11:04.587
- how that happened!
- It's not really our screw-up.

11:04.622 --> 11:06.155
Damn it!

11:08.893 --> 11:11.493
Max.

11:11.529 --> 11:13.429
What are you doing?

11:13.464 --> 11:15.998
We got to leave. Today.

11:16.033 --> 11:17.866
Now. I'm sorry to say it, doll.

11:17.902 --> 11:19.768
It may be time for us to split up,

11:19.804 --> 11:21.602
because this whole thing is over.

11:21.637 --> 11:22.838
It's over and it's finished!

11:22.873 --> 11:25.341
We're not running.
I've accepted his proposal.

11:25.376 --> 11:26.842
You really are crazy.

11:26.877 --> 11:28.677
It's our only play.

11:28.713 --> 11:31.313
And we're gonna use Ezra,
Richard, and Jules to help us.

11:31.349 --> 11:32.982
God help all of you, then.
Come on, come on.

11:33.017 --> 11:34.283
Listen to me. Listen.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.684
I have an idea. It's a good one.

11:35.720 --> 11:37.720
God damn it, get out of my way,
or so help me!

11:37.755 --> 11:40.155
Max, if we run, we die. We die!

11:41.859 --> 11:43.492
You know I'm right.

12:02.486 --> 12:04.486
She's not coming, man.

12:06.590 --> 12:11.226
Hey, she set the meeting. She's coming.

12:11.782 --> 12:14.730
It's like we're in a giant birth canal.

12:15.085 --> 12:18.734
Like we're being born again,
given a second chance.

12:18.769 --> 12:21.203
Maybe that's why she chose here.

12:21.238 --> 12:23.839
Maybe, or maybe it's just
a good, safe spot

12:23.874 --> 12:25.841
in a public place.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.843
Maybe she bolted.

12:27.878 --> 12:30.179
Literally, out of a window, bolted.

12:30.214 --> 12:31.914
I don't know why we're
falling for this shit again.

12:31.949 --> 12:35.951
Because, like I said,
this time she needs us.

12:37.588 --> 12:39.021
And here she is.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.393
- What the hell?
- How's the finger?

12:44.428 --> 12:46.261
- Finger's fine.
- Well, you heal fast.

12:46.297 --> 12:48.831
- That's a good trait.
- I hope you do, too.

12:48.866 --> 12:52.067
- Oh, I have an idea...
- Hey, hey, everybody calm down.

12:54.405 --> 12:56.905
So, here we are.

12:56.941 --> 13:01.009
And no amount of blaming
or finger pointing

13:01.045 --> 13:03.178
or finger breaking or bullshitting

13:03.214 --> 13:04.746
is going to change the fact

13:04.782 --> 13:07.182
that we are all... all five of us...

13:07.218 --> 13:09.051
in the exact same boat.

13:09.086 --> 13:12.721
We run, the Feds catch us,

13:12.756 --> 13:14.590
or the Doctor kills us.

13:14.625 --> 13:16.191
Us?

13:16.227 --> 13:18.460
You think the Doctor
knows they're in Seattle?

13:18.496 --> 13:20.395
I would imagine so, yes.

13:20.431 --> 13:24.867
So, yes, us.
We are, simply put, cornered.

13:24.902 --> 13:28.403
Nice to see you, too.
Who's got the cyanide?

13:28.439 --> 13:30.305
I have a plan.

13:30.341 --> 13:32.774
So, wait a sec. This Heller guy leaves,

13:32.810 --> 13:35.777
and then you guys decided
to scam Patrick instead?

13:35.813 --> 13:37.880
It's irrelevant.
We should just focus on the job.

13:37.915 --> 13:39.481
Kinda, yes.

13:39.517 --> 13:40.816
"Kinda?"

13:40.851 --> 13:43.485
Well, that's suspiciously inarticulate.

13:43.521 --> 13:44.820
When Heller disappeared,

13:44.855 --> 13:46.622
the Doctor made Patrick the new mark.

13:46.657 --> 13:49.091
He's very rich,
and he was already on the hook,

13:49.126 --> 13:50.626
if you know what I mean.

13:52.129 --> 13:54.663
- Interesting.
- Why's that interesting?

13:54.698 --> 13:56.665
Proof of life on Mars, I guess.

13:56.700 --> 13:58.967
You know, formerly thought
to have been uninhabitable.

13:59.003 --> 14:01.996
Hmm. I told you she digs athletes.

14:02.031 --> 14:03.138
Like in real life.

14:03.173 --> 14:07.009
Yeah, the coal-black heart
pumps a drop of thick blood.

14:07.044 --> 14:08.610
All right, you know what?
This is exactly

14:08.646 --> 14:10.646
the kind of irrelevant
bullshit I was talking about.

14:10.681 --> 14:13.015
You want to have a turf
war over my vagina?

14:13.050 --> 14:15.083
Go right ahead.
Me and Max over here are gonna

14:15.119 --> 14:17.286
focus on not getting jailed or killed.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.289
Grow up and be professional.

14:20.324 --> 14:23.091
We are not professional
con artists, you are.

14:23.127 --> 14:26.128
Really? Where'd you get
the money to come find me?

14:27.898 --> 14:30.098
Who'd you pretend to be
when you conned my parents

14:30.134 --> 14:31.700
in Pottsville?

14:33.070 --> 14:34.970
They have the look, don't they, Max?

14:35.005 --> 14:37.306
They might, yeah. They just might.

14:37.341 --> 14:39.007
What's the look?

14:39.043 --> 14:41.643
Some people need the life.
They've done something bad,

14:41.679 --> 14:44.513
or someone or something is chasing them.

14:44.548 --> 14:47.849
Other people get a taste of the grift,

14:47.885 --> 14:49.685
and then they get hungry for it.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.987
They like it.

14:52.022 --> 14:53.789
Those people have the look.

14:53.824 --> 14:57.559
So, let's not pretend
we're not all up to the task.

14:59.496 --> 15:02.497
Eyes on the prize. Agreed?

15:03.251 --> 15:04.232
Good.

15:04.268 --> 15:08.070
Max and I are going to teach you
everything you need to know.

15:08.105 --> 15:11.840
And then we take Patrick,

15:11.875 --> 15:13.976
we pay off the Doctor,

15:14.011 --> 15:16.511
and the FBI doesn't
even know what happened.

15:16.547 --> 15:19.014
Okay.

15:19.049 --> 15:21.316
What do we do?

15:21.352 --> 15:24.686
<i>Max will give each of you
a specific assignment.</i>

15:24.722 --> 15:28.690
<i>You need to be supplied and ready
by end-of-day tomorrow.</i>

15:28.726 --> 15:31.293
<i>And then, well...</i>

15:31.328 --> 15:33.729
<i>then the show begins.</i>

16:09.978 --> 16:13.112
Grant 6000 series.
State-of-the-art lock.

16:13.148 --> 16:15.081
Very difficult to open.

16:15.116 --> 16:17.016
But you got one of those
lock-picky things, right?

16:17.052 --> 16:20.420
Lock-picky? Jeez, nope.

16:20.455 --> 16:23.189
You... What are we going to...

16:23.225 --> 16:24.190
Oh.

16:27.963 --> 16:30.897
Here, here.

16:30.932 --> 16:32.131
You have the code, right?

16:32.167 --> 16:34.067
What? Why would I have the c...

16:34.102 --> 16:35.735
No, man, no, I don't have the code.

16:35.770 --> 16:38.404
Well, shit, we have about
30 seconds to figure it out.

16:38.440 --> 16:42.242
If you were a beefy FBI guy
pretending to be a billionaire,

16:42.277 --> 16:43.409
what... what would the code be?

16:43.923 --> 16:45.445
"Helipad," "caviar"...

16:45.480 --> 16:47.413
It's numbers...
What year was the FBI invented?

16:47.449 --> 16:49.782
Like, the '70s or something?
I-I don't know, man!

16:49.818 --> 16:50.950
Nah, I'm just messing with you.

16:50.986 --> 16:51.951
Maddie gave me the code.

16:53.455 --> 16:54.587
You're an asshole, dude.

16:54.623 --> 16:56.990
Let's just get this over with.

16:57.025 --> 16:59.058
Got to have a sense of fun, kid.

16:59.094 --> 17:01.261
I'm just happy I finally asked him.

17:01.296 --> 17:03.263
- You asked him?
- Hold on, wait a minute.

17:03.298 --> 17:05.565
Well, he asked me first
when we were in Aspen,

17:05.599 --> 17:06.633
but I said no.

17:06.667 --> 17:09.301
- Really?
- Yeah.

17:09.337 --> 17:11.771
And I said
"Let's just run away together,"

17:11.806 --> 17:15.742
and I swear he almost said yes to that.

17:15.777 --> 17:17.944
- Really?
- Okay, come on.

17:18.662 --> 17:20.233
- I didn't say that.
- Hold on, you.

17:20.269 --> 17:22.248
Saffron, what happened next?

17:22.284 --> 17:23.616
I don't know. We came home,

17:23.652 --> 17:26.319
and I looked at him one day,

17:26.354 --> 17:30.690
and thought to myself, "I am crazy."

17:30.725 --> 17:32.926
Right? I mean, I have to marry this man.

17:32.961 --> 17:35.128
I love him.

17:35.163 --> 17:36.529
So I asked him.

17:36.564 --> 17:40.166
I am so glad you did.

17:40.201 --> 17:42.602
Otherwise this marriage
may have never happened.

17:43.275 --> 17:45.605
Oh, it's happening.

17:45.640 --> 17:47.307
It's all happening.

17:54.649 --> 17:56.516
Now, that pisses me off.

17:56.551 --> 17:57.817
Sloppy.

17:57.852 --> 17:59.185
No name, no address.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.955
Get the subscriptions. It's lazy.

18:01.990 --> 18:03.189
Amateur hour.

18:03.325 --> 18:05.124
Amateur hour.

18:06.995 --> 18:09.862
Barcode, Barney's Discount
Furniture Warehouse.

18:09.898 --> 18:12.532
I mean, come on.

18:16.738 --> 18:18.371
Hey, look at this.

18:18.406 --> 18:20.974
The guy's got exactly the same pants on

18:21.009 --> 18:23.334
in Hawaii and on Christmas.

18:25.800 --> 18:26.879
Not bad, kid.

18:26.915 --> 18:28.581
I mean, khakis are comfortable,

18:28.616 --> 18:30.650
and they do provide good support,

18:30.685 --> 18:32.318
but that's a good get.

18:32.354 --> 18:33.753
Thanks.

18:33.788 --> 18:37.023
Listen. The pinky thing.

18:37.058 --> 18:38.825
- Yeah, can we not...
- No, no, no, no.

18:38.860 --> 18:40.593
Let me talk.

18:40.628 --> 18:42.095
I'm sorry it had to happen.

18:42.130 --> 18:45.231
But I got to say,
you took it like a man.

18:45.266 --> 18:47.834
Thanks.

18:47.869 --> 18:50.570
Maddie should never
have missed this stuff.

18:50.605 --> 18:51.871
She was distracted.

18:52.170 --> 18:53.306
Yeah.

18:54.943 --> 18:57.243
She said it's in here.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.681
Yeah, nice bedroom.

19:01.716 --> 19:03.950
Perfect angle from here.

19:09.891 --> 19:11.290
Camera.

19:16.097 --> 19:17.430
Pretty discreet, huh?

19:17.465 --> 19:19.265
Yeah, I'd never notice it,

19:19.300 --> 19:20.566
not even know it was there.

19:20.602 --> 19:22.869
And that is the art of the con.

19:22.904 --> 19:24.971
They should never even know it happened.

19:25.006 --> 19:27.073
And both sides of my
family are gonna come

19:27.108 --> 19:29.709
from Cincinnati and Pottsville,
of course,

19:29.744 --> 19:32.745
and I was thinking we could
pay for their flights.

19:32.781 --> 19:34.580
They don't have a lot of money, so...

19:34.616 --> 19:37.617
Actually, we can just get a coordinator

19:37.652 --> 19:39.318
to work out all the travel stuff.

19:39.354 --> 19:41.154
That would be amazing.

19:41.189 --> 19:43.656
I mean, that could get awfully pricey.

19:43.691 --> 19:45.124
Yeah, but...

19:45.160 --> 19:46.459
Where's my friends?

19:46.494 --> 19:47.827
I don't have a reservation.

19:47.862 --> 19:49.395
Oh, I'm calm!

19:49.431 --> 19:51.064
Oh, my God.

19:51.099 --> 19:52.565
What are you doing?
I'm just trying to find...

19:52.600 --> 19:54.200
- Isn't that your brother?
- Yeah.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.501
Oh, they're here.
No, it's fine, I got them.

19:55.537 --> 19:57.103
- Please calm down, sir.
- Hey, guys.

19:57.138 --> 19:58.671
- Please, please...
- No, I'm calm, I'm...

19:58.706 --> 19:59.939
I don't know if you're
in the right restaurant.

19:59.974 --> 20:01.407
I would be liking to join my friends.

20:01.443 --> 20:03.743
- Okay, please, please watch...
- Sorry, sorry.

20:03.778 --> 20:05.111
- Sorry.
- Yes, thank you.

20:05.146 --> 20:06.112
Ezra.

20:06.147 --> 20:10.016
Hey! Hey, guys, hey.

20:10.695 --> 20:11.484
How's it going?

20:11.519 --> 20:14.120
Good God, man.
You smell like a distillery.

20:14.155 --> 20:15.288
What's going on?

20:15.323 --> 20:19.125
A toast of congratulations

20:19.160 --> 20:22.829
to Patrick and Gina...

20:22.864 --> 20:24.330
Welcome to the club.

20:24.365 --> 20:26.866
You know, same boat now.

20:28.136 --> 20:29.936
- Same boat? I don't...
- Look.

20:29.971 --> 20:32.705
I'm not gonna let you
do it to somebody else.

20:32.740 --> 20:34.674
All right?

20:34.709 --> 20:37.810
'Cause I like you, man. You know?

20:37.846 --> 20:41.047
- You seem nice, and she's...
- Ezra.

20:41.082 --> 20:43.349
She's not the woman you think she is.

20:43.384 --> 20:45.351
No, it's fine. I'm gonna tell a story.

20:45.386 --> 20:48.221
I met a girl... a "Belgian" girl...

20:48.256 --> 20:50.490
in Indianapolis, and... whoa...

20:50.525 --> 20:52.225
I'm just gonna take him home. Come on.

20:52.260 --> 20:53.826
- I'm telling a story!
- You're embarrassing me.

20:53.862 --> 20:55.695
- Do you want me to help you?
- No, no, no, I...

20:55.730 --> 20:57.830
No, I'm trying to tell...
I'm trying to tell a story.

20:57.866 --> 20:59.031
- I'm just gonna take him home.
- Story time.

20:59.067 --> 21:00.032
- Stop it.
- What? I'm...

21:00.068 --> 21:01.167
I'll call you later.

21:01.202 --> 21:02.468
She'll call you later. Yeah.

21:02.504 --> 21:03.836
She'll call... Yeah, of course she will.

21:03.872 --> 21:05.238
- I'm sorry.
- She's so sorry.

21:05.273 --> 21:07.240
You know,
you'll be sorry if you marry her!

21:07.275 --> 21:10.109
Stop it. Shut up.

21:11.179 --> 21:12.678
What the hell was that?

21:12.714 --> 21:14.080
I thought he was working with her.

21:14.115 --> 21:17.316
The whole lame brother
backstory and everything?

21:17.352 --> 21:18.818
Yeah, me too.

21:18.853 --> 21:20.820
Unbelievable.

21:20.855 --> 21:23.189
This is what you do? Huh?

21:23.224 --> 21:25.525
Get drunk and make a scene?

21:27.595 --> 21:33.533
I mean, I cannot...
I cannot even believe how...

21:34.769 --> 21:37.806
amazing you were!

21:38.606 --> 21:40.072
Hey, high school drama club, baby.

21:40.108 --> 21:42.575
- Wow.
- Yeah.

21:42.610 --> 21:44.310
What is this? Iced tea!

21:44.345 --> 21:45.945
- Uh-huh.
- I'm impressed.

21:45.980 --> 21:46.946
Thank you very much.

21:46.981 --> 21:48.714
Good work, Ezra Bloom.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.049
Nice working with you, too.

21:50.084 --> 21:51.197
Hmm.

21:53.121 --> 21:54.687
We deserve a real drink.

21:54.722 --> 21:56.022
I think we do.

21:56.057 --> 21:57.123
- Let's go.
- All right.

21:57.991 --> 21:58.724
Come on.

21:58.760 --> 22:00.793
What if he's one of her former marks?

22:00.828 --> 22:02.562
Came looking for her.

22:02.597 --> 22:04.597
Jesus, I mean, what if he...
What if he scares her off?

22:04.632 --> 22:06.432
What if... What if she runs?

22:06.467 --> 22:10.269
No, no, no, he didn't completely
blow it for her yet.

22:10.305 --> 22:12.038
You know what? This...

22:12.073 --> 22:13.773
This actually might be good for us.

22:13.808 --> 22:15.608
We looked it up. It's the mustard dip.

22:15.985 --> 22:17.076
It's a thing.

22:17.111 --> 22:19.212
- It's a real thing, so...
- The mustard dip!

22:19.247 --> 22:21.614
Yeah, so we screwed
that one up twice, and...

22:21.649 --> 22:23.749
But then I worked on my hand lifts,

22:23.785 --> 22:26.085
and then we pulled of this
major version of it in a mall

22:26.120 --> 22:29.322
right after we reverse-found
your IP address and located you.

22:29.357 --> 22:31.757
There was this guy in a
seersucker suit sitting there...

22:31.793 --> 22:32.992
What?

22:33.027 --> 22:35.228
Nothing. Nothing.

22:35.263 --> 22:37.296
You're just really into this.

22:37.796 --> 22:38.764
Yeah, well,

22:38.800 --> 22:41.434
necessity is the mother of...
blah, blah.

22:41.469 --> 22:43.469
But now, I mean,
in the restaurant, you and me...

22:43.504 --> 22:45.375
like, I knew exactly
what you were gonna do

22:45.410 --> 22:46.308
right before you did it.

22:46.343 --> 22:47.240
It was like...

22:47.275 --> 22:48.841
Like we're in each other's heads.

22:48.876 --> 22:50.309
Yes! Totally in sync.

22:50.345 --> 22:51.811
Like, you know, like the time we...

22:51.846 --> 22:53.279
the time we had dinner with Mom and Dad

22:53.314 --> 22:54.614
at that weird Thai place, and...

22:54.649 --> 22:56.017
Oh, my God.

23:06.694 --> 23:11.631
Yeah, well, the important thing is,
he took the bait, so...

23:11.666 --> 23:13.366
So, when do you make the move?

23:13.401 --> 23:15.935
Depends on how worried he is.

23:15.970 --> 23:17.970
Maybe tonight.

23:20.866 --> 23:23.509
_

23:23.745 --> 23:25.544
Don't do that.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.880
You do not get to do that anymore.

23:27.915 --> 23:29.115
What?

23:29.150 --> 23:32.818
Speak French, flirt, be Ava.

23:32.854 --> 23:34.787
Let's not play games with each other.

23:34.822 --> 23:36.789
Well...

23:36.824 --> 23:38.624
is this the Ezra Bloom I married?

23:38.660 --> 23:40.192
Definitely not.

23:40.228 --> 23:42.662
I guess I have you to thank for that.

23:42.697 --> 23:44.230
Or something.

23:49.537 --> 23:51.170
I'm beat.

23:53.441 --> 23:54.907
You got me covered?

23:54.942 --> 23:57.476
Sure. It's the least...

23:57.512 --> 23:59.211
The least you can do?

23:59.247 --> 24:01.714
Yeah. It is.

24:16.306 --> 24:17.707
All right.

24:21.246 --> 24:22.678
Got a little thrill, don't you?

24:22.714 --> 24:24.280
Yeah, man.

24:24.315 --> 24:26.282
Got to admit I love it.

24:26.317 --> 24:28.284
Always puts a little goose
in my step, too.

24:28.319 --> 24:29.352
- Yeah.
- Jazzed!

24:30.989 --> 24:34.524
Hey, um, you want to go
blow off some steam?

24:34.559 --> 24:35.892
Sure.

24:35.927 --> 24:37.126
All right. Cool.

24:37.162 --> 24:38.995
I got just the place.

24:42.292 --> 24:43.866
Keep going.

24:43.902 --> 24:44.967
Got to be kidding.

24:45.003 --> 24:46.335
Keep going!

24:48.273 --> 24:50.006
There's no way, man!

24:57.849 --> 24:58.859
Oh!

25:00.218 --> 25:01.584
Whoo!

25:01.619 --> 25:03.753
I want to see another one of those, kid.

25:03.788 --> 25:05.555
Holy shit.

25:07.358 --> 25:09.759
Why'd you stop playing ball, anyway?

25:09.794 --> 25:13.029
Ugh. It wasn't my choice, really.

25:14.199 --> 25:15.898
I, um...

25:15.934 --> 25:18.167
6-foot at 14...

25:18.203 --> 25:21.103
still 6-foot at 18.

25:21.139 --> 25:22.872
That was it for me.

25:22.907 --> 25:24.674
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:26.311 --> 25:29.312
That was the biggest heartbreak
I could imagine, man.

25:30.415 --> 25:32.748
Out of my control, you know?

25:32.784 --> 25:34.116
Yeah.

25:36.421 --> 25:38.054
And then Alice.

25:40.758 --> 25:43.426
That was the real heartbreak.

25:43.461 --> 25:47.964
That one I felt like I did to myself.

25:47.999 --> 25:50.633
Well, we're pretty good at our jobs.

25:53.171 --> 25:55.238
Sorry, bud.

25:55.273 --> 25:56.839
Oh, man, it's all right.

25:59.777 --> 26:02.578
It's just...

26:02.614 --> 26:06.549
I look at her now, and...

26:06.584 --> 26:09.752
it's not Alice, you know?

26:09.787 --> 26:13.823
It's like that connection
that we had is just...

26:13.858 --> 26:16.559
it's gone.

26:16.594 --> 26:19.128
It's just, like...

26:20.431 --> 26:21.764
What about you, man?

26:21.799 --> 26:23.966
You ever been married?

26:24.002 --> 26:25.534
Nah. No.

26:29.007 --> 26:31.440
Well, I had someone.

26:31.476 --> 26:33.209
I mean, for a time.

26:35.280 --> 26:36.913
And if things had just
been a touch different,

26:36.948 --> 26:39.115
if we weren't in the life,

26:39.150 --> 26:43.753
she could've been the one, but...

26:43.788 --> 26:48.190
she screwed up,
and I had to break it up, and...

26:51.229 --> 26:54.163
send her packing, so to speak.

26:57.201 --> 27:00.836
But, like you said,
I kind of did it to myself.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.375
And now she's gone.

27:08.313 --> 27:09.879
I'm sorry, man.

27:15.153 --> 27:16.986
All right.

27:19.057 --> 27:20.156
Ready?

27:20.191 --> 27:21.657
Yep.

27:23.261 --> 27:24.694
Ah!

27:40.578 --> 27:42.678
Hey, babe.

27:42.714 --> 27:47.483
I am so, so sorry about that.

27:47.518 --> 27:49.185
Everything okay?

27:49.220 --> 27:50.920
You know, he was never a drinker.

27:50.955 --> 27:53.322
I don't get it.
I mean, a couple of beers

27:53.358 --> 27:54.991
here and there, but now it's like...

27:55.026 --> 27:56.859
Nah, it's fine. I'm just glad he's okay.

27:59.030 --> 28:03.399
Just don't worry about any
of that stuff he said, okay?

28:03.434 --> 28:07.069
Oh, babe, it's all good.
He was hammered, I get it.

28:07.105 --> 28:10.373
Just... he talks crazy sometimes.

28:13.277 --> 28:15.745
Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm reading here.

28:15.780 --> 28:19.749
Oh-ho! "Sports Insider" reading?

28:19.784 --> 28:21.584
Yeah, you're right.
I just like the pictures.

28:21.619 --> 28:22.718
They're shiny.

28:22.754 --> 28:24.687
Shiny. I know.

28:24.722 --> 28:26.322
Mm-hmm.

28:34.665 --> 28:36.399
The plot thickens.

28:40.171 --> 28:42.638
I'm gonna tell you three things.

28:42.673 --> 28:44.006
Ready?

28:44.042 --> 28:45.741
Ready.

28:46.978 --> 28:49.912
One:

28:49.947 --> 28:53.916
I really, really

28:53.951 --> 28:57.353
almost fell in love with you.

28:58.756 --> 29:00.423
Almost? What do you mean?

29:00.458 --> 29:03.759
Shh.

29:03.795 --> 29:07.096
Two:

29:07.131 --> 29:09.965
I know you're in the FBI.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.274
- I'm not...
- Don't.

29:20.211 --> 29:22.344
- All right, that's enough.
- Settle.

29:23.815 --> 29:26.515
Don't you want to know number three?

29:28.286 --> 29:30.786
I'm going to make you a deal,

29:30.822 --> 29:33.923
and we're both gonna get what we want.

29:33.958 --> 29:36.459
<i>Okay, baby?</i>

29:45.010 --> 29:46.310
Ugh! Damn it!

29:46.345 --> 29:47.811
Come on. You're a big policeman.

29:47.846 --> 29:49.112
You know you can't get
out of those things

29:49.148 --> 29:50.781
without keys.

29:50.816 --> 29:53.283
- Saffron.
- Maddie.

29:53.319 --> 29:55.886
- Maddie.
- Good.

29:55.921 --> 29:57.120
You know, I would've loved

29:57.156 --> 29:58.822
to have kept this little charade going,

29:58.857 --> 30:01.858
but that scene my ex just
pulled in the restaurant

30:01.894 --> 30:03.727
kind of forced my hand.

30:03.762 --> 30:06.530
You and your sister aren't dummies.

30:06.565 --> 30:09.132
Do you understand the
Bureau is all over you,

30:09.168 --> 30:10.400
and it's only because
of me that you haven't

30:10.436 --> 30:11.835
been arrested already?

30:11.870 --> 30:13.570
You arrest me,
you don't get what you want.

30:13.606 --> 30:15.672
Well, we're gonna see
about that, aren't we?

30:15.708 --> 30:18.041
Really? You don't want the Doctor?

30:21.046 --> 30:22.546
Keep talking.

30:22.581 --> 30:25.115
Gary Heller was laundering
money for the Doctor.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.850
He was also skimming.

30:26.885 --> 30:28.485
The Doctor thinks he
recovered all of it,

30:28.520 --> 30:30.053
but when I tell him I found

30:30.089 --> 30:31.655
a half a million dollars more of his

30:31.690 --> 30:34.157
buried in Heller's house,

30:34.193 --> 30:35.692
he will come to collect.

30:35.728 --> 30:37.661
- You found half a million...
- No, stupid.

30:37.696 --> 30:40.864
The Bureau will provide it.
It's called bait.

30:40.899 --> 30:42.599
That's absurd.

30:42.635 --> 30:44.568
Is it?

30:44.603 --> 30:48.372
This house. Your Tesla.

30:48.407 --> 30:49.806
Aspen.

30:51.143 --> 30:52.709
Government has gone this far.

30:52.745 --> 30:55.078
What's a little bit
more to seal the deal?

30:55.114 --> 30:58.615
Especially when they're
going to get it all back.

30:58.651 --> 31:00.584
All right, cool. I'll play.

31:00.619 --> 31:03.353
Got to ask the obvious:
why would I trust you?

31:03.389 --> 31:05.589
Do you really have a choice?

31:07.593 --> 31:09.559
Besides,

31:09.595 --> 31:11.628
maybe not everything
that happened between us

31:11.664 --> 31:13.297
was a total lie.

31:13.332 --> 31:14.598
Oh, no?

31:14.633 --> 31:16.066
You tell me.

31:21.774 --> 31:24.308
What's your angle? What do you get?

31:24.343 --> 31:26.143
Immunity.

31:26.178 --> 31:30.147
I get you the Doctor, you get me
someplace new to start over.

31:30.182 --> 31:32.883
Really start over.

31:32.918 --> 31:36.119
Believe it or not,
all I want right now is to feel normal.

31:37.456 --> 31:39.890
You think you can sell it to the Bureau?

31:39.925 --> 31:43.660
If you'll testify,
and it gets me the Doctor,

31:43.696 --> 31:46.496
then... yeah.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.465
Good. Ezra Bloom, my ex.

31:48.500 --> 31:50.133
Max, my right-hand man.

31:50.169 --> 31:52.002
You have to leave them
alone for this to play out.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.637
I don't think the Bureau
is going to offer immunity

31:53.672 --> 31:54.905
to all these people.

31:54.940 --> 31:56.573
I don't care if they get immunity.

31:56.608 --> 31:58.975
Look, whatever happens
with them after this is over,

31:59.011 --> 32:00.143
that's up to you.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.179
But for now, we need them.

32:03.282 --> 32:04.681
Cold hearted.

32:04.717 --> 32:06.650
It's the life we chose, baby.

32:06.685 --> 32:08.485
What about Ezra's girlfriend?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.420
Jules? Totally clueless.

32:10.456 --> 32:11.755
I feel vaguely bad for her.

32:11.790 --> 32:13.623
He just picked her up
to make me jealous.

32:13.659 --> 32:15.625
If you cut her loose,
he'll know something's up.

32:15.661 --> 32:17.327
Let her be.

32:19.565 --> 32:23.266
So, do we have a deal?

32:23.974 --> 32:26.236
Yeah.

32:26.271 --> 32:27.604
We have a deal.

32:27.639 --> 32:28.605
Good.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.507
On one condition.

32:30.542 --> 32:32.809
You don't really get to make conditions

32:32.845 --> 32:33.844
considering the fact...

32:33.879 --> 32:36.446
I'm gonna need the ring.

32:36.482 --> 32:37.881
Oh, this?

32:37.916 --> 32:40.350
Yeah, that little million-dollar thing.

32:42.354 --> 32:43.920
Take it.

32:56.902 --> 33:00.370
That one is breathtaking.

33:00.406 --> 33:03.440
Oh, I know
just the right hairpiece for that.

33:17.389 --> 33:21.391
You are just so beautiful.

33:21.427 --> 33:22.492
Damn it.

33:25.898 --> 33:28.064
We didn't have any of this.

33:28.100 --> 33:30.500
We were much cooler than this.

33:30.536 --> 33:31.935
I don't know.

33:33.705 --> 33:36.440
Sometimes it makes me even more crazy

33:36.475 --> 33:40.010
the way we just ran off and got married,

33:40.045 --> 33:43.747
no one there to see us,
none of my friends,

33:43.782 --> 33:45.949
nobody to say that they
were actually there

33:45.984 --> 33:48.518
and that it really happened.

33:48.554 --> 33:52.522
Hey. It happened.

33:52.558 --> 33:56.526
I know it technically happened.

33:59.598 --> 34:01.598
What? What is it?

34:03.569 --> 34:06.770
You know how many times I've done this?

34:06.805 --> 34:09.005
Stood here in this dress?

34:10.641 --> 34:12.708
I don't really want to know.

34:15.414 --> 34:18.547
This is gonna be the last one, right?

34:18.583 --> 34:22.452
Once this is over, you can...

34:22.487 --> 34:25.688
You must think I'm really
messed up, don't you?

34:27.759 --> 34:30.126
I don't know.

34:30.161 --> 34:33.797
Yes... maybe.

34:36.668 --> 34:39.302
Not when we were together.

34:41.639 --> 34:44.940
Whoever that person I was with...

34:44.976 --> 34:47.777
she was...

34:47.813 --> 34:49.813
something else.

34:56.621 --> 34:58.121
I got you.

35:13.505 --> 35:14.871
I missed you.

35:14.907 --> 35:16.206
Jules...

35:17.309 --> 35:18.508
Stop.

35:18.544 --> 35:19.876
Stop it.

35:22.714 --> 35:24.814
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

35:26.652 --> 35:28.385
You're the devil.

35:28.420 --> 35:30.120
Jules.

35:30.155 --> 35:31.388
Come on, we can't do this.

35:31.423 --> 35:33.056
Okay, I'm not your pal, okay?

35:33.091 --> 35:35.559
I was your wife!

35:35.594 --> 35:36.860
I can't do this anymore.

35:36.895 --> 35:39.362
- Jules.
- I'm out.

35:39.398 --> 35:41.064
What do you mean you're out?

35:41.099 --> 35:42.532
Jules, come on. We need you.

35:42.568 --> 35:44.134
None of this is gonna work without you.

35:44.169 --> 35:46.169
I guess it won't work.

35:54.286 --> 35:55.412
<i>Hello?</i>

35:55.447 --> 35:57.747
Hey. We're in trouble.

35:57.783 --> 35:59.215
<i>I think Jules is gonna bail on us.</i>

35:59.251 --> 36:01.418
<i>You got to talk to her ASAP, okay?</i>

36:06.298 --> 36:07.157
Jules?

36:07.846 --> 36:09.259
Hey.

36:09.294 --> 36:10.827
She called you. I guess that makes you

36:10.862 --> 36:12.429
her favorite, then, doesn't it, huh?

36:12.464 --> 36:14.014
Okay, look, she feels really bad
that she upset you.

36:14.049 --> 36:15.582
And I'm sure you got it quite a thrill

36:15.617 --> 36:17.617
when she needed you to
clean up her little mess.

36:17.653 --> 36:20.086
Just like I did when we kissed.

36:22.357 --> 36:25.425
She didn't tell you that part? Ha.

36:25.460 --> 36:27.360
Whatever happens at
Barbara's Bridal Boutique

36:27.396 --> 36:28.928
stays at Barbara's Bridal Boutique.

36:28.964 --> 36:30.830
- What about the code?
- There is no goddamn code

36:30.866 --> 36:34.000
when you're in a bridal dressing room
with the woman you loved.

36:34.036 --> 36:36.603
There's just words and promises

36:36.638 --> 36:39.906
and melancholy and kissing.

36:39.941 --> 36:43.143
And scissoring! So much scissoring!

36:45.614 --> 36:47.347
Okay, screw Maddie, all right?

36:47.382 --> 36:49.416
I need you.

36:49.451 --> 36:51.418
Richard needs you.

36:51.453 --> 36:54.454
We've come this far to try
and make our lives whole again.

36:54.489 --> 36:57.223
Am I right? We're all in this.

36:57.259 --> 36:58.358
We have to finish this.

36:58.393 --> 37:02.062
Not for her, but... for us.

37:25.020 --> 37:27.020
Got any quarters?

37:31.860 --> 37:33.293
What are you doing?

37:33.328 --> 37:34.928
Oh.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.432
Stupid.

37:57.686 --> 38:00.587
You know she's playing you, too, right?

38:00.622 --> 38:02.622
You're not special.

38:04.626 --> 38:06.326
I'm not special.

38:07.396 --> 38:08.962
Richard...

38:08.997 --> 38:10.960
Definitely isn't special.

38:15.137 --> 38:19.105
This is still a con,
and we're all suckers.

38:19.141 --> 38:23.109
Now we're just the
suckers who are in on it.

38:40.662 --> 38:42.028
<i>And?</i>

38:42.063 --> 38:43.797
<i>Well, the wedding is on.</i>

38:43.832 --> 38:47.033
Ah, how great.
Congratulations all around.

38:47.068 --> 38:49.502
<i>Well, I-I wanted you
to be the first to know.</i>

38:49.538 --> 38:51.738
Dad, come on. It's starting.

38:51.773 --> 38:52.872
I'll be right up, kiddo.

38:52.908 --> 38:54.407
Anything else I need to know?

38:54.443 --> 38:55.909
<i>Uh, no, no. That's the report.</i>

38:55.944 --> 38:57.977
<i>And I'll be getting back to you.</i>

38:58.680 --> 39:00.013
Doctor, I...

39:10.625 --> 39:12.659
Ezra Bloom, stop walking!

39:12.694 --> 39:14.527
Hands up! Get your hands up!

39:14.563 --> 39:16.196
- Show me your hands, show 'em.
- All right, all right.

39:16.231 --> 39:17.597
- Go to the hood.
- All right.

39:17.632 --> 39:18.631
Go to the hood. Get your head down.

39:28.684 --> 39:32.220
I know Maddie Johnson had a
plan to take all my money.

39:34.324 --> 39:35.756
And I'm sure

39:35.792 --> 39:37.692
that you were hoping to get yours back

39:37.727 --> 39:39.160
after she stole mine.

39:40.597 --> 39:42.730
But guess what?

39:42.765 --> 39:44.899
I don't make that kind of money.

39:47.971 --> 39:50.972
Yeah. Bitter pill.

39:53.243 --> 39:55.109
I knew you were bad news.

39:55.144 --> 39:57.645
I told Maddie when I met you there was
something about you that just didn't...

39:57.680 --> 40:00.214
You told her what?

40:00.250 --> 40:03.284
That I wasn't rich or handsome

40:03.319 --> 40:04.886
or charming as hell?

40:04.921 --> 40:06.754
Screw you. I want a lawyer.

40:06.789 --> 40:09.724
You got no idea what
you stepped into here.

40:09.759 --> 40:11.659
But you getting drunk

40:11.694 --> 40:15.296
and screaming to the world
that Maddie is Saffron

40:15.331 --> 40:19.133
or Saffron is Maddie,
and the sky is falling...

40:19.168 --> 40:21.068
That doesn't help me do my job.

40:21.104 --> 40:24.105
Why would I care about
helping you do your job?

40:34.384 --> 40:37.785
Whatever fantasy you have in your head

40:37.820 --> 40:40.688
about sticking by her side,

40:40.723 --> 40:44.592
and maybe she'll realize that
you guys are meant to be...

40:44.627 --> 40:47.194
it's never gonna happen.

40:47.230 --> 40:50.631
Maddie Johnson cares about one person:

40:50.667 --> 40:53.034
Maddie Johnson.

40:53.069 --> 40:56.837
She doesn't give a shit about you.

40:59.208 --> 41:01.709
Meanwhile, I got you.

41:04.047 --> 41:08.649
I got you on credit card fraud,

41:08.685 --> 41:11.352
I got you on identity theft,

41:11.387 --> 41:13.554
and I got you on petty larceny.

41:13.590 --> 41:18.159
So, you are going to do
whatever it is I need you to do

41:18.194 --> 41:20.861
to take her down.

41:20.897 --> 41:25.766
Or you are going to
go to big boy prison.
