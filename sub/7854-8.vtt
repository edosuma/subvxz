All right, Ralph.
Tie it up!

00:33.376 --> 00:34.726
Lookin' good!

00:35.320 --> 00:36.690
I love you, too!

00:53.344 --> 00:55.677
Um... Uncle Scrooge!

Someone is here to see you!

Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"Treasure of the Found Lamp!"</font>

02:01.363 --> 02:03.316
Uh, so, um... Mr. Djinn,

02:03.403 --> 02:04.998
can I get you something
while you wait?

02:05.086 --> 02:06.633
A... a Pep?

02:06.783 --> 02:08.985
I am in no mood for Pep.

02:09.073 --> 02:11.906
I seek only the Lamp
of the First Genie,

02:11.993 --> 02:15.606
a sacred relic of untold value
that the last of my line

02:15.693 --> 02:18.430
has sworn to protect
for all time.

02:18.570 --> 02:20.906
Today, on the Eve
of the Ifrit's Dawn,

02:20.993 --> 02:24.226
my quest must come
to a triumphant conclusion,

02:24.328 --> 02:28.086
or the consequences may be dire.

02:28.464 --> 02:30.250
How about a Diet Pep?

02:31.122 --> 02:33.545
I know that lamp
is here somewhere.

02:33.633 --> 02:35.810
I found it years back,
shoved in among

02:35.898 --> 02:37.422
the Treasure of Collie Baba.

02:37.515 --> 02:40.177
Perhaps if you had told
literally anyone about it

02:40.265 --> 02:41.568
instead of locking it away...

02:41.656 --> 02:43.084
There's nothing to tell!

02:43.172 --> 02:44.740
It's a cheap bauble,
not worth

02:44.828 --> 02:46.661
all the hard adventure
it took to get it.

02:46.748 --> 02:47.871
Big waste of time!

02:47.958 --> 02:49.911
Why would I tell anyone
about that?

02:49.998 --> 02:51.414
Found it!

02:51.537 --> 02:53.000
It's gotta be one of these!

02:53.088 --> 02:54.251
It's none of those.

02:54.338 --> 02:56.482
The lamp Djinn's looking for
is worthless!

02:56.570 --> 02:58.302
I inspected it personally.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.751
No genie,
no mystical properties,

03:00.838 --> 03:02.411
no... No!

03:02.498 --> 03:04.548
Ahh!

03:09.320 --> 03:11.201
The Ferryman's Flame!

03:11.289 --> 03:13.404
It lights the way
to the land of the dead!

03:13.492 --> 03:14.811
But how is anybody
supposed to know

03:14.898 --> 03:16.187
about anything in here?

03:16.458 --> 03:19.001
Because I know.
That's all that matters.

03:19.088 --> 03:21.250
Ugh. Well, what does
the right lamp look like?

03:21.367 --> 03:23.121
It's a faded bronze oil lamp

03:23.208 --> 03:25.291
with a scalloped pattern
on the lid.

03:25.406 --> 03:26.914
Oh, boy.

03:27.880 --> 03:30.226
What do ya mean, yard sale?!

03:30.475 --> 03:33.209
Um, so, did you see
last week's episode

03:33.297 --> 03:35.289
of "Ottoman Empire"?

03:35.844 --> 03:39.248
The Ottoman Empire?
You refer to those dread invaders

03:39.336 --> 03:42.039
that tried to destroy
my ancestors for the lamp?

03:42.201 --> 03:44.609
They failed. Miserably.

03:44.824 --> 03:46.367
I like everything
about you!

03:46.588 --> 03:50.125
So, funny thing,
about the lamp.

03:50.213 --> 03:52.200
Eh... uh, you'll love this.

03:52.288 --> 03:55.397
It appears I have
misplaced it.

03:55.998 --> 03:59.161
You misplaced...
the Lamp of the First Genie?!

03:59.248 --> 04:01.103
I shall raise this home!

04:01.353 --> 04:04.290
Strip it
to the rafters, brick by brick!

04:04.378 --> 04:05.751
And I will not leave!

04:05.838 --> 04:08.412
I will not stop
until I find it!

04:08.500 --> 04:09.945
Did he say "misplaced"?

04:10.033 --> 04:12.776
Uncle Scrooge
meant to say "stolen"!

04:12.918 --> 04:15.430
Yes, the lamp... was...

04:15.518 --> 04:17.209
stolen by a powerful figure!

04:17.297 --> 04:19.317
Ohh, uh, uh, ooh,
profoundly powerful!

04:19.406 --> 04:21.161
Ooh, like a wicked sorcerer?

04:21.248 --> 04:23.911
Or a powerful God,
like a Sumerian God,

04:23.998 --> 04:25.001
or maybe Greek?!

04:25.088 --> 04:27.617
Yes, Webby, a Greek God!

04:28.338 --> 04:30.381
Do you think it's
on Ithaquack?!

04:30.469 --> 04:33.081
Yup, sure is!
It's way out on Ithaquack.

04:33.168 --> 04:35.541
Oh, so Djinn, I guess
you must be going...

04:35.628 --> 04:36.753
Stolen!

04:37.763 --> 04:39.439
Then we must
go to this Ithaquack

04:39.527 --> 04:41.883
- and reclaim the lamp!
- Yes!

04:42.027 --> 04:43.527
"W-W-We"?

04:45.726 --> 04:48.242
Scrooge McDuck,
Finder of the Lamp,

04:48.344 --> 04:51.265
I swear allegiance
to the courage in your veins.

04:51.375 --> 04:54.914
United, we have the power
to mete justice.

04:55.082 --> 04:57.351
Definitely... Ugh...

04:57.458 --> 04:59.592
So, I've compiled a list
of possible foes:

04:59.680 --> 05:01.357
There's Hades, Apollo...

05:01.445 --> 05:02.911
And let's not forget Zeus!

05:03.078 --> 05:05.621
Louie accidentally
sold the lamp.

05:05.708 --> 05:08.661
This fellow will tear apart
our home until we find it.

05:08.748 --> 05:10.922
Yeah, and if we don't,
he might tear us apart.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.875
Webby, we need
to keep him busy

05:12.963 --> 05:14.828
while you boys track it down.

05:15.039 --> 05:17.623
Do you think you could
come up with some phony quest

05:17.711 --> 05:21.248
or trials to occupy him...
Wha... Are you... Are you crying?

05:21.336 --> 05:22.701
This is my moment.

05:22.788 --> 05:25.461
A legendary quest
by Webby Vanderquack!

05:25.548 --> 05:27.703
Get ready for
the ultimate adventure,

05:27.791 --> 05:28.695
Mr. Djinn!

05:28.783 --> 05:30.757
Tarry not!
The lamp awaits!

05:32.353 --> 05:35.507
Find. That. Lamp.

05:40.380 --> 05:43.370
And so, the boys were left
to their own devices

05:43.458 --> 05:47.262
on an impossible quest
to right a careless wrong!

05:47.350 --> 05:49.109
Would it bring them closer

05:49.204 --> 05:51.812
or tear them apart?

05:53.378 --> 05:56.411
What? I like Djinn's
dramatic flair!

05:56.498 --> 05:59.169
So, you sold off
a priceless artifact...

05:59.257 --> 06:00.371
I didn't sell it!

06:00.458 --> 06:02.609
And it was valued
at three bucks, tops.

06:02.697 --> 06:04.291
I put together
a little yard sale

06:04.378 --> 06:06.171
of junk I found
in the garage.

06:06.794 --> 06:08.968
Eh, I got bored
after 20 minutes.

06:12.068 --> 06:14.731
So, I unloaded
the yard sale duties.

06:14.819 --> 06:16.804
You made Duckworth
do all the work?

06:16.918 --> 06:19.081
It's his job!
He lives for it!

06:19.168 --> 06:20.082
He's a ghost!

06:20.169 --> 06:21.505
And who I am to deprive him

06:21.593 --> 06:23.609
of a chance
to feel alive again, Hubert?

06:23.741 --> 06:26.820
With tensions high,
the boys were left with no choice

06:26.908 --> 06:30.906
but to confront the one soul
without a soul!

06:30.994 --> 06:32.987
I haven't seen Duckworth
in a week.

06:33.129 --> 06:34.700
How are we supposed
to find a ghost?

06:34.788 --> 06:37.249
I have a very simple solution.

06:38.266 --> 06:39.991
This doesn't feel simple.

06:53.518 --> 06:56.374
So, you seek the lamp, huh?

06:59.416 --> 07:02.200
The Gods of Old
bring all of the noblest heroes

07:02.288 --> 07:04.831
to the Temple
as a final test of their merits

07:04.918 --> 07:07.132
before rewarding them
with the spoils.

07:07.220 --> 07:08.830
Each chamber will be a trial,

07:08.918 --> 07:11.609
every trial harder
than the last.

07:16.838 --> 07:19.411
Who dare wake me

07:19.498 --> 07:23.390
from my infinite slumber?!

07:23.478 --> 07:24.538
Uh...

07:24.707 --> 07:27.374
What poor excuse for a hero

07:27.462 --> 07:30.285
believes he has what it takes.

07:30.458 --> 07:33.179
To... contain?

07:33.300 --> 07:37.327
Mighty Charybdis!

07:37.525 --> 07:39.308
Yea... it... it is us!

07:39.396 --> 07:41.910
Scrooge and Djinn!
Have it ye,

07:41.998 --> 07:44.251
ya multi-armed monstrosity!

07:45.458 --> 07:47.201
Oh! Oh! Ohh! Oh, no!

07:47.288 --> 07:49.541
Ohh, ya blasted beast!

07:53.498 --> 07:55.001
You have dispatched
my most loyal

07:55.089 --> 07:57.581
and chivalrous ally!
You shall pay!

07:57.668 --> 08:01.227
Ow! Hey! I wasn't done
with my scene!

08:01.315 --> 08:02.885
For the lamp!

08:08.244 --> 08:11.197
Thanks for letting us
borrow your temple, Selene.

08:11.285 --> 08:14.328
We have to keep
this persistent paladin busy.

08:14.416 --> 08:15.592
Why have a deadly temple

08:15.680 --> 08:16.944
if you're not gonna use it,
right?

08:17.031 --> 08:20.560
Make it stop, please!
This wasn't the scene!

08:20.755 --> 08:23.282
No improv! Stick to the script!

08:27.182 --> 08:29.990
So, how does this work?
Do I just call out to him, or...?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.734
Um, that's not Duckworth.

08:45.168 --> 08:47.109
Francis, they're with me.

08:49.668 --> 08:52.291
How dare you interrupt
my long-overdue vacation?!

08:52.378 --> 08:54.615
Sorry, sorry, sorry!
It was Huey's idea!

08:54.703 --> 08:56.341
What?! We need to know

08:56.429 --> 08:58.672
who bought the lamp
from the garage sale.

08:59.654 --> 09:02.157
I believe I sold it
to a rakish gentleman.

09:02.245 --> 09:03.726
Said the lamp
would go perfectly

09:03.814 --> 09:05.726
with a Persian rug
he had recently acquired.

09:05.814 --> 09:07.664
Unfortunately,
he had no money,

09:07.752 --> 09:10.224
until an errant breeze
blew a crisp $20 bill

09:10.312 --> 09:11.922
directly into his open wallet.

09:12.010 --> 09:13.880
Quite a stroke of luck.

09:15.052 --> 09:16.305
Hm.

09:21.123 --> 09:22.976
Uncle
Gladstone has the lamp!

09:23.064 --> 09:24.857
That serendipitous deadbeat.

09:24.985 --> 09:26.361
Call as soon as
you get it!

09:26.752 --> 09:28.359
I give! I give!

09:29.832 --> 09:31.790
I thank you, Charybdis,
for the journey,

09:31.878 --> 09:34.621
and honor your role
in the Legend of the Lamp.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.371
We have to keep stalling!
What now?

09:37.458 --> 09:40.219
We're going to Appendix B!

09:43.391 --> 09:47.134
Dewdrop! Greener Pastures!
Red Hat!

09:47.378 --> 09:50.251
Can I offer you some refreshments,
some winning lotto tickets?

09:50.338 --> 09:51.619
How about
a handful of diamonds

09:51.707 --> 09:52.724
I found in a bag of ice?

09:52.812 --> 09:55.375
There's no time for that!
Where's the lamp?

09:55.748 --> 09:56.841
Buh?

09:56.929 --> 09:58.030
The ancient oil lamp
you bought

09:58.117 --> 09:59.121
from our garage sale?

09:59.208 --> 10:01.062
We need it
to save Uncle Scrooge!

10:01.903 --> 10:04.606
Oh, that thing!
No idea!

10:05.846 --> 10:08.508
I was walking back
from your place,

10:08.596 --> 10:10.429
cheerfully singing
my own praises...

10:10.517 --> 10:13.460
♪ Gladstone
Gander Gladstone Gander ♪

10:13.548 --> 10:16.383
♪ Gladstone Gander
I am he ♪

10:16.588 --> 10:17.835
...when my melodious musings

10:17.922 --> 10:19.398
caught the attention
of someone

10:19.486 --> 10:21.149
who wanted to buy the lamp.

10:21.237 --> 10:25.250
He wanted to pay me in,
get this, sticky nickels?!

10:25.338 --> 10:26.351
Uh, no, thank you!

10:26.439 --> 10:28.849
So instead, I opted
to trade it with him

10:28.937 --> 10:30.918
for my brand new home!

10:34.748 --> 10:38.304
Wait, who would trade a blimp
for an old, beat-up lamp?

10:38.445 --> 10:42.170
Some rich kid. Came out of
a giant tree house.

10:42.258 --> 10:44.371
- Rich kid?
- Tree house?

10:44.458 --> 10:45.992
Sticky nickels?!

10:46.136 --> 10:47.908
- Doofus Drake! - Doofus Drake!
- Doofus Drake!

10:47.995 --> 10:50.528
The Impossible
Riddle of the Minotaur!

10:50.685 --> 10:54.554
It can only be answered
by the purest of heart.

10:55.748 --> 10:57.461
Shh! He's coming, he's coming!

10:58.668 --> 11:00.911
Minotaur, it is I, Djinn.

11:00.998 --> 11:03.581
The Ifrit's Dawn nears,
and I seek the lamp

11:03.668 --> 11:06.461
that is my birthright.
State your riddle.

11:06.548 --> 11:11.751
Djinn, be thee worthy?

11:11.838 --> 11:13.297
Aye.

11:13.623 --> 11:17.036
Are you sure?

11:17.288 --> 11:19.001
Are you stalling?

11:19.088 --> 11:23.203
OK, OK.
The Minotaur's Riddle!

11:24.433 --> 11:27.312
"I'm more powerful
than the Gods,

11:27.418 --> 11:30.500
more evil than the demons.

11:30.599 --> 11:34.762
The poor have me,
the rich need me.

11:34.904 --> 11:38.527
If you eat me, you shall die.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.039
What am I?"

11:43.340 --> 11:45.213
Take your time!

11:45.332 --> 11:48.521
Heroes tougher than you
have been stumped by the Myno...

11:48.609 --> 11:50.501
- Nothing.
- I'm sorry, what?

11:50.588 --> 11:52.672
Nothing is more powerful
than the Gods,

11:52.760 --> 11:54.713
nothing more evil
than the demons.

11:54.801 --> 11:56.870
The poor have nothing,
the rich need nothing,

11:56.958 --> 11:59.331
and if you eat nothing,
you shall perish.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.661
Now, let me pass!

12:00.748 --> 12:02.461
That is correct.

12:02.653 --> 12:05.771
Next question!

12:05.859 --> 12:07.304
But I have answered
your riddle.

12:07.392 --> 12:09.177
Well, it's... it's really
more of a quiz.

12:09.265 --> 12:12.701
Um, so... a train
leaves Duckburg

12:12.788 --> 12:14.871
traveling
at 60 miles per hour...

12:14.958 --> 12:17.791
As they marched
to their next trial,

12:17.878 --> 12:20.508
a cold chill
tickled their spines.

12:20.596 --> 12:24.219
The Mad Boy King of Duckburg
could spell their doom!

12:24.458 --> 12:25.820
Not helping, Dewey!

12:25.908 --> 12:28.651
Some cheap piece of brass
isn't worth all this trouble.

12:28.739 --> 12:30.640
Maybe we could get Djinn
a replacement lamp?

12:31.023 --> 12:32.661
Djinn monologued about this lamp

12:32.748 --> 12:36.383
and the Ifrit's Dawn
for 10 minutes without blinking.

12:36.497 --> 12:38.411
Hmm...

12:39.309 --> 12:42.974
Scrooge and Webby are counting on us!

12:43.109 --> 12:45.469
Scrooge and Webby
can take care of themselves!

12:46.161 --> 12:47.374
To see time fly.

12:47.548 --> 12:49.304
Now, if there are no further
riddles...

12:49.392 --> 12:51.107
That's the end
of the joke book.

12:51.195 --> 12:52.251
Um...

12:57.283 --> 12:59.463
I've got your nose!

12:59.923 --> 13:01.040
Monster!

13:01.128 --> 13:02.687
Is it not enough
to steal the lamp,

13:02.775 --> 13:05.021
but now you claim my nose
as well?!

13:05.109 --> 13:06.616
Ooh, uh, you may pass!

13:06.703 --> 13:07.858
You may... you may pass.
You may pass.

13:07.945 --> 13:10.661
I thank you, Minotaur,
for the journey,

13:10.859 --> 13:13.998
and honor your role
in the Legend of the Lamp.

13:19.208 --> 13:20.685
Come on, come on.

13:20.773 --> 13:22.068
What's takin' them so long?

13:32.838 --> 13:33.883
Um...

13:38.788 --> 13:42.554
I call that Funtime Suntime.

13:43.524 --> 13:45.687
Anyway, you were saying?

13:47.250 --> 13:48.461
We weren't.

13:48.548 --> 13:50.871
You've been playing
the theremin for an hour.

13:50.958 --> 13:53.687
Um...
Heya, buddy!

13:53.775 --> 13:57.969
Yeah, do ya... do you remember
purchasing an old lamp recently?

13:58.086 --> 13:59.993
Hmm... lamp?

14:00.088 --> 14:03.594
Lamp. Lamp. Lamp.

14:03.682 --> 14:06.437
Lamp, lamp, lamp, lamp, lamp,
lamp, lamp, lamp, lamp, lamp.

14:06.525 --> 14:08.370
Lamp, lamp, lamp...
ahh, ohh!

14:08.458 --> 14:10.437
You mean my syrup boat.

14:10.534 --> 14:12.827
Yeah, OK, sure, man, whatever.

14:12.915 --> 14:15.859
I needed it for my one-man
flapjack jamboree.

14:15.950 --> 14:17.984
It was the perfect syrup boat.

14:18.235 --> 14:20.025
Until it ran out.

14:22.204 --> 14:24.711
So I... disposed of it.

14:24.799 --> 14:26.250
- Aah!
- It's in your trash?

14:26.338 --> 14:27.943
Why not just refill it?

14:28.031 --> 14:29.791
Oh, I no longer need a boat.

14:36.041 --> 14:38.284
May I wash my hands now?

14:38.372 --> 14:39.572
No!

14:39.668 --> 14:41.273
The trash cans!

14:42.719 --> 14:43.752
The lamp!

14:43.839 --> 14:45.701
Is somewhere on that truck!

14:45.788 --> 14:48.279
Cruel irony!
One man's treasure

14:48.375 --> 14:50.898
is another man's trash,
and...

14:55.347 --> 14:56.883
What do we do, Uncle Scrooge?

14:56.971 --> 14:58.714
I can't stall that door
much longer!

14:58.918 --> 15:00.748
If there's no lamp,
that marauder

15:00.836 --> 15:03.411
will have our hides
for using a pointless quest

15:03.498 --> 15:05.501
to distract him
from his pointless quest!

15:07.213 --> 15:08.293
Yes?

15:09.431 --> 15:11.422
Jumpin' jalopinous junkheaps!

15:25.708 --> 15:29.001
I have proven myself.
Where is it?

15:29.088 --> 15:31.201
You made it.

15:31.288 --> 15:34.701
But, uh, before you completed
the Minotaur's Quiz,

15:34.788 --> 15:37.701
the nefarious...
Wrote it down here, ah!

15:37.788 --> 15:42.064
Ma Beagle stole the lamp
and returned to Duckburg!

15:42.152 --> 15:44.002
Yeah. That's why
I'm breathing heavy.

15:44.090 --> 15:46.602
I just fought her.
Yeah.

15:50.588 --> 15:53.399
Then we must return
to Duckburg!

16:11.456 --> 16:13.181
This place is crawling
with crooks.

16:14.654 --> 16:16.197
Let's wait for some to leave,

16:16.285 --> 16:17.847
grab that trinket,

16:17.935 --> 16:20.457
and then we never
speak of this ever again.

16:20.583 --> 16:22.960
There is no time!
The Ifrit's Dawn nears!

16:23.048 --> 16:25.353
If by daybreak the lamp
is in the wrong hands,

16:25.441 --> 16:27.363
the consequences
would be devastating!

16:27.451 --> 16:29.098
- What?! - Since when?!
- It's dangerous? - Really?!

16:29.185 --> 16:30.628
But I examined it!

16:30.716 --> 16:32.330
The lamp had no powers!

16:32.418 --> 16:34.461
Did you examine it
on the Ifrit's Dawn?

16:34.582 --> 16:36.378
Well, no, but...

16:36.466 --> 16:38.040
We need to find a way
to sneak in

16:38.128 --> 16:39.751
without tipping them off,
and then...

16:39.838 --> 16:41.572
Treacherous Beagles!

16:43.256 --> 16:44.806
Hand over the lamp!

16:45.644 --> 16:47.142
What is this garbage

16:47.230 --> 16:49.126
distracting me
from my garbage?

16:49.214 --> 16:52.541
I am Faris Djinn,
Seeker of the Lamp!

16:52.628 --> 16:54.198
You knew the lamp's worth
when you stole it

16:54.285 --> 16:55.541
from the Temple of Heroes!

16:55.628 --> 16:57.461
I didn't steal no lamp!

16:57.589 --> 16:59.661
The ancient token
of my fathers.

16:59.748 --> 17:01.961
The Lamp of the First Genie!

17:02.175 --> 17:04.535
Genie lamp?! Dibs!

17:04.666 --> 17:06.011
Take him out!

17:06.127 --> 17:07.980
You got it, Ma!

17:10.998 --> 17:12.699
It is in my junkyard!

17:12.787 --> 17:16.040
Someone threw it away,
and that means it belongs to me!

17:17.715 --> 17:20.199
Threw it away?
Who would have...?

17:20.807 --> 17:22.720
And what of our quest and...?

17:23.088 --> 17:24.746
Has this all been a charade?

17:24.868 --> 17:26.548
A false quest to hide the fact

17:26.636 --> 17:29.001
that you cast aside the lamp
as garbage?

17:29.088 --> 17:31.541
I'm sorry! We didn't know
the lamp was a big deal!

17:31.628 --> 17:34.043
Uncle Scrooge tells us nothing!

17:37.049 --> 17:38.082
For the lamp!

17:47.744 --> 17:49.995
This is so much
realer than my fake adventure!

17:51.488 --> 17:53.121
Come on, lads!

17:53.222 --> 17:54.411
Keep 'em busy!

17:54.498 --> 17:57.074
I'm gonna get me
some genie wishes!

18:01.708 --> 18:03.222
Djinn, I'm sorry
I tricked you.

18:03.339 --> 18:04.871
If I'd known
what was at stake...

18:04.958 --> 18:06.462
Another chapter in the legend.

18:06.550 --> 18:08.701
A final trial
before we find the lamp!

18:08.788 --> 18:10.276
It's all part of the journey!

18:37.423 --> 18:38.750
Aah!

18:41.199 --> 18:42.383
Oh!

18:50.168 --> 18:52.581
Ech! Bleh!
It could be anywhere!

18:52.668 --> 18:54.814
Uncle Scrooge!
The lamp!

18:58.128 --> 18:59.179
There!

18:59.267 --> 19:01.541
Misbah. The lamp.

19:03.588 --> 19:05.056
Come on!

19:08.019 --> 19:09.392
Go! Get the lamp!

19:09.502 --> 19:11.478
Before the Ifrit's Dawn!

19:16.208 --> 19:18.161
Argh! No ya don't!

19:21.362 --> 19:23.416
It's mine!

19:26.338 --> 19:29.041
Got it! First wish:
better kids!

19:31.378 --> 19:33.650
- I wish you wasn't so mean, Mama.
- Aw, man!

19:34.650 --> 19:37.200
What gives?
Where's the magic?

19:37.288 --> 19:39.853
The genie? The wishes?!

19:42.199 --> 19:43.482
Is that what you thought?

19:43.570 --> 19:46.323
An actual living genie
inside the lamp?

19:46.411 --> 19:48.228
You took that literally?

19:49.248 --> 19:51.121
You said
it would be devastating

19:51.208 --> 19:52.501
in the wrong hands!

19:52.588 --> 19:54.701
Yes, devastating
to me personally.

19:54.788 --> 19:56.371
It's a precious
family heirloom.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.564
And... the "Ifrit's Dawn"?

19:58.682 --> 20:02.119
It's my birthday.
And I can think of no finer gift.

20:05.164 --> 20:08.226
So why did we do
any of this?!

20:08.314 --> 20:11.119
The story of the lamp
goes back centuries,

20:11.276 --> 20:12.979
back in olden times.

20:13.168 --> 20:17.121
My great-great-great-great-great-great-
great-great grandmother

20:17.208 --> 20:19.121
discovered the lamp
at a bazaar.

20:19.208 --> 20:23.283
After accidentally rubbing it,
a genie did, in fact, emerge.

20:23.392 --> 20:24.877
Instead of asking for wishes,

20:24.965 --> 20:28.549
my grandmother befriended
this lively, impish fellow,

20:28.745 --> 20:30.314
and they fell in love.

20:31.173 --> 20:35.086
When it came time to wish,
my grandmother made just one...

20:35.385 --> 20:37.322
To free her love.

20:37.455 --> 20:39.322
Though he no longer
had any magic,

20:39.498 --> 20:42.411
he granted her every wish
as her devoted husband.

20:42.498 --> 20:44.765
Much like this lamp,
the true magic

20:44.853 --> 20:45.871
was in their journey.

20:45.958 --> 20:47.963
And after centuries
of searching,

20:48.168 --> 20:51.807
my family has finally reclaimed
the totem that started it all.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.331
Enough! Time to trash
this piece of junk!

20:56.449 --> 20:57.619
Hey!

20:59.927 --> 21:02.744
Anyone else wish
to test me on my birthday?

21:02.878 --> 21:05.248
- Uh-uh.
- Happy birthday, dude!

21:07.099 --> 21:10.297
A triumph for the family
and their new ally!

21:10.385 --> 21:12.174
Having found both the lamp

21:12.262 --> 21:14.542
and the greatest treasure
of all...

21:14.630 --> 21:16.883
A cool story to tell!

21:17.096 --> 21:18.799
- Aw.
- Boo!

21:18.918 --> 21:21.161
So, Djinn, what will
you do now?

21:21.248 --> 21:23.821
Find a new quest.
And let this lamp be the start

21:23.909 --> 21:26.331
of a whole new legend
to share with my descendants.

21:26.487 --> 21:28.190
A treasure's greatest value

21:28.278 --> 21:30.245
lies in the stories
it can tell us.

21:32.147 --> 21:34.542
Stories, eh?

21:35.165 --> 21:39.602
Welcome to the tax deductible
Adventurer's Wing

21:39.690 --> 21:41.989
of the Duckburg Museum!

21:42.248 --> 21:44.371
It was time for a little
spring cleaning.

21:44.565 --> 21:47.127
And time to share these tales
with you all.

21:47.215 --> 21:48.460
And everyone!

21:48.658 --> 21:50.331
What's special about this?

21:50.418 --> 21:53.121
That's the famed
Candy Stripe Ruby.

21:53.208 --> 21:55.541
A gift from the king
of Rippan Taro Island.

21:55.628 --> 21:57.205
Ya see, this was long ago.

21:57.332 --> 21:59.174
I was am ambitious young lad...
