07:36.083 --> 07:37.667

CHARLOTTE--

08:01.750 --> 08:03.458

08:09.083 --> 08:10.709
THERE'S
A RELATIVELY NEW PROCESS.

08:10.750 --> 08:12.709
IT INVOLVES INSERTING A PROBE
INTO YOUR BRAIN

08:12.750 --> 08:15.709
AND LOOKING FOR THE SCARRING
THAT INITIATES THE SEIZURES.

08:15.750 --> 08:17.709
THE PROBE IS TRIGGERED
TO TRANSMIT RADIO WAVES,

08:17.750 --> 08:19.709
WHICH HEAT AND ABLATE
THE SCAR.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.709
SHE'S GONNA BURN MY BRAIN?

08:21.750 --> 08:23.709
I'M GONNA REMOVE
THE TROUBLE SPOT.

08:23.750 --> 08:26.166
THE IDEA IS NO MORE SCAR,
NO MORE SEIZURE, BUT--

08:26.208 --> 08:29.417
YOU CAN JUST MAKE THEM STOP?
BUT IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

08:29.458 --> 08:32.041
THE SCARRING THAT'S CAUSING
YOUR MOM'S SEIZURES IS ALSO

08:32.083 --> 08:34.375
VERY CLOSE TO
THE MOTOR CENTER OF THE BRAIN.

08:34.417 --> 08:37.417
WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
DR. SHEPHERD
CAN EXPLAIN THE RISKS.

08:37.458 --> 08:40.083
YOUR MOM COULD WIND UP
PARALYZED IN THE ARM OR FACE.

08:40.125 --> 08:42.208
SHE COULD HAVE AN APHASIA--
DIFFICULTY SPEAKING

08:42.250 --> 08:44.000
OR PROCESSING SPEECH--

08:44.041 --> 08:46.041
AND IN VERY RARE CASES,
THERE IS PARTIAL BLINDNESS.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.041
BUT THESE ARE
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS.

08:48.083 --> 08:51.041
MORE LIKELY--I CUT, THE SEIZURES
STOP, YOUR MOM IS FINE.

08:51.083 --> 08:54.041
AND IF I DON'T DO
THE SURGERY?

08:54.083 --> 08:56.041
WELL, THE SEIZURES
COULD GET WORSE.

08:56.083 --> 08:58.583
THEY PUT YOU AT RISK
FOR HEAD INJURY AND FALLS.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.041
AND IF THEY CONTINUE

09:00.083 --> 09:02.041
WITH THE INTENSITY
THAT WE'VE WITNESSED,

09:02.083 --> 09:04.041
YOU WILL LIKELY HAVE
IRREVERSIBLE BRAIN DAMAGE.

09:04.083 --> 09:06.041
PARALYZED TODAY
OR DEMENTED TOMORROW--

09:06.083 --> 09:07.667
LOVELY CHOICE.

09:07.709 --> 09:10.667
HOW LONG BEFORE THE SEIZURES
CAUSE PERMANENT BRAIN DAMAGE?

09:10.709 --> 09:12.208
10, 15 YEARS.

09:12.250 --> 09:15.583
WELL, IN TEN YEARS,

09:15.625 --> 09:18.041
YOU'LL BE 25.

09:18.083 --> 09:21.041
SO IF YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO
THE SURGERY NOW, YOU COULD...

09:21.083 --> 09:23.208
DO IT IN A YEAR,
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW.

09:23.250 --> 09:26.667
AND BE THAT MUCH WORSE OFF.
IT DEPENDS ON WHEN YOU WANT
TO TAKE THE RISK.

09:26.709 --> 09:29.250
I'M OFFERING YOU A CURE.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.625
(Sharon) NO.

09:34.667 --> 09:38.458
NO SURGERY.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.375
LOOK, IS THERE A CHANCE
FOR AN ADVERSE RESULT? YES.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.375
BUT... I MEAN,
THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE

09:43.417 --> 09:45.917
THAT I CAN MAKE YOU BETTER,
COMPLETELY.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.208
I THINK
THAT SHARON WAS CLEAR.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.834

09:51.875 --> 09:55.041
WE'RE DOING ALL RIGHT
THE WAY THINGS ARE, RIGHT?

09:55.083 --> 09:57.542
YEAH.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.667

09:59.709 --> 10:01.041

10:11.959 --> 10:13.917

A CURE.

10:13.959 --> 10:17.417
BECAUSE I CAN GIVE HER ONE
BECAUSE I AM A NEUROSURGEON.

10:17.458 --> 10:19.750
LOOK, I DON'T TELL YOU
HOW TO HANDLE VAGINAS.

10:19.792 --> 10:23.250
OKAY. IF YOU CUT AND IT
GOES BAD, WHAT HAPPENS TO JULIE?

10:23.291 --> 10:25.959
IF I DON'T CUT,
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE MOTHER?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
RIGHT NOW,
NOTHING THEY CAN'T HANDLE.
HOW RISKY IS THE PROCEDURE?

10:28.041 --> 10:30.375
WELL, IT'S RISKY ENOUGH
THAT THE MOTHER COULD WIND UP

10:30.417 --> 10:31.875
PARALYZED OR BLIND,

10:31.917 --> 10:34.041
WHICH MEANS THAT
HER 15-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

10:34.083 --> 10:37.041
WOULD WIND UP TAKING CARE OF HER
INSTEAD OF THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

10:37.083 --> 10:40.041
I MEAN, LOOK, BETTER THAT
THEY HAVE FIVE OR TEN

10:40.083 --> 10:42.959
GOOD YEARS TOGETHER
THAN NONE AT ALL.
I AM OFFERING THEM
A LIFETIME TOGETHER,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.000
NOT JUST A FEW YEARS.
DOES THE DAUGHTER
EVEN WANT THE SURGERY?

10:46.041 --> 10:47.875
NO.
BECAUSE SHE'S TAKING THE LEAD
FROM HER MOM.

10:47.917 --> 10:49.709
NO, AMELIA. SHE HEARD YOU.

10:49.750 --> 10:52.959
SHE HEARD BOTH OF US,
AND SHE MADE A DECISION.
YOU STACKED THE DECK.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.041
STACKED THE DECK? I GAVE THEM
MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION--

10:55.083 --> 10:57.041
LIKE I SAID. YOU ARE NOT
AN NEUROSURGEON.

11:03.125 --> 11:05.750
DID EITHER OF YOU
TELL COOPER?

11:05.792 --> 11:07.333
WHAT?
(Violet) NO.

11:07.375 --> 11:10.000
ABSOLUTELY NOT,
CHARLOTTE.

11:10.041 --> 11:13.000
I DIDN'T TELL COOPER,
BUT I-I TOLD THE COPS.

11:15.041 --> 11:16.792
THE POLICE BROUGHT ME IN

11:16.834 --> 11:19.500
TO INTERVIEW A GUY
ON THE NIGHT OF YOUR...

11:19.542 --> 11:22.000
HE ADMITTED
TO HAVING ATTACKED A WOMAN.

11:22.041 --> 11:26.000
HE WAS--HE WAS ARRESTED
NOT FAR FROM THE HOSPITAL.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.542
SHELDON KNOWS.

11:29.583 --> 11:32.041
IS THERE ANYONE YOU PEOPLE
HAVEN'T TOLD?

11:33.667 --> 11:37.000
I...

11:37.041 --> 11:39.041
I SENT THE POLICE
PELVIC WASHINGS THAT I TOOK.

11:39.083 --> 11:41.041
I KNOW YOU SAID NO RAPE KIT,
BUT--

11:41.083 --> 11:43.792
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DID NOT DO THAT.
YOU WERE IN SHOCK, CHARLOTTE.

11:43.834 --> 11:46.375
I WANTED TO PRESERVE
ALL OF YOUR OPTIONS--
SHUT UP.

11:46.417 --> 11:49.208
JUST SHUT UP.

11:50.875 --> 11:53.583
THEY CAN'T JUST ARREST
THE GUY?

11:53.625 --> 11:57.458
WE CAN'T GET HIM OFF THE STREETS
WITHOUT CHARLOTTE'S HELP.

11:57.500 --> 12:01.166
SO THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE...
BECAUSE OF MOM?

12:01.208 --> 12:05.041
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T
THOUGHT ABOUT GETTING IN TOUCH.

12:05.083 --> 12:06.667
I'M SURE YOU HAVE, TOO.

12:06.709 --> 12:09.417
SHE'S DYING.
SLOWLY, BUT SHE'S DYING.

12:09.458 --> 12:11.875
AND NO ONE IN THERE
GIVES A DAMN.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.792
BUT YOU CAN HELP HER.
HOW?

12:14.834 --> 12:16.709
YOU KNOW WHAT
A HUMANITARIAN RELEASE IS,

12:16.750 --> 12:18.750
RIGHT?

12:20.834 --> 12:23.083
YOU KNOW, I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT CALLING YOU.

12:23.125 --> 12:26.667
WHATEVER PROBLEMS YOU AND I HAVE
ARE BECAUSE OF HER.

12:26.709 --> 12:29.083
BUT FOR YOU TO SHOW UP HERE
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS

12:29.125 --> 12:32.834
AND TRY TO GUILT ME
INTO SOME--
I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO DO
ANYTHING WRONG. PLEASE...

12:32.875 --> 12:34.875
JUST GO SEE HER.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.000
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

12:45.125 --> 12:48.208
HEY. I WANT YOU TO
CONVINCE HER TO DO THE LINEUP.

12:48.250 --> 12:50.959
COME ON, COOPER.
MAYBE SHE'LL LISTEN TO YOU.

12:51.000 --> 12:54.250
SHE SURE AS HELL
WON'T LISTEN TO ME.
IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO
TELL CHARLOTTE TO DO ANYTHING.

12:54.291 --> 12:57.125
SHE HASN'T ASKED ME FOR HELP.
LIKE THAT'S EVER STOPPED YOU.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.875
IT'S THE RIGHT THING.
YOU WENT AFTER KATIE.
I WANTED REVENGE.

12:59.917 --> 13:02.041
SO WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

13:02.083 --> 13:04.041
WELL, IN THE END,
THAT WOULD'VE HURT ME MORE,

13:04.083 --> 13:06.041
SO I FORGAVE HER
AND I LET IT GO.

13:06.083 --> 13:08.041
WELL, I WANT CHARLOTTE
TO HAVE THE SAME OPTION.

13:08.083 --> 13:12.000
I KNOW HER, VIOLET. SHE NEEDS
TO LOOK THAT BASTARD IN THE EYE

13:12.041 --> 13:14.000
AND SAY, "IT WAS YOU."

13:15.917 --> 13:18.041
HEY.
HEY.

13:18.083 --> 13:20.041
HEARD YOU, UH, HAD A VISITOR.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.917
HARD TO KEEP
A SECRET AROUND HERE.

13:22.959 --> 13:25.959
YEAH. I WAS SURPRISED.
YOU, UH...

13:26.000 --> 13:28.500
YOU NEVER MENTIONED
YOU HAD A BROTHER.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.792
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO HIM
IN A LONG TIME,

13:30.834 --> 13:32.917
NOT SINCE MY MOTHER...

13:34.917 --> 13:39.792
MY MOTHER'S IN PRISON...
FOR MANSLAUGHTER.

13:39.834 --> 13:41.500
FOR...
(plastic crinkles)

13:41.542 --> 13:44.792
OH. I, UH...
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

13:44.834 --> 13:47.000
NOW SHE'S SICK.
HE SHOWS UP OUT OF THE BLUE.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.709
HE WANTS ME TO HELP HER
GET A HUMANITARIAN RELEASE.

13:49.750 --> 13:51.542
ARE YOU GOING TO?

13:51.583 --> 13:53.542
I DON'T KNOW.
(containers clattering)

13:53.583 --> 13:55.208
WHAT'S YOUR MOTHER LIKE?

13:55.250 --> 13:56.959
UH... MY--

13:57.000 --> 13:59.709
I DON'T KNOW.
SHE'S, UH, SHE'S A MOM.

13:59.750 --> 14:04.375
MY MOTHER JUST...
DIDN'T REALLY GIVE A DAMN.

14:04.417 --> 14:07.750
WELL, MY MOM USED TO SAY,

14:07.792 --> 14:11.041
"PEOPLE DO THE BEST THEY CAN
WHEN THEY CAN."

14:11.083 --> 14:13.000
HER BEST WASN'T ANYTHING.

14:13.041 --> 14:14.959
YOU THINK SHE CHANGED?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.875
I DON'T KNOW.
WELL, SOMETIMES
PEOPLE CAN SURPRISE YOU.

14:17.917 --> 14:20.041
(utensil clatters)

14:20.083 --> 14:22.875
(indistinct conversations)

14:22.917 --> 14:25.917
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

14:27.208 --> 14:30.542
HOMEWORK?

14:30.583 --> 14:33.417
OH. (chuckles)
MY MODEL U.N. SPEECH.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.792
MM. THAT'S A LOT OF WORK...

14:35.834 --> 14:38.834
ON TOP OF WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH YOUR MOM.

14:38.875 --> 14:42.041
I'VE BEEN THROUGH WORSE.
(chuckles)

14:42.083 --> 14:44.375
MY DAD DIED WHEN I WAS 5.

14:45.834 --> 14:49.417
AND SUDDENLY, I WAS ALWAYS
WORRIED ABOUT MY MOM...

14:49.458 --> 14:51.834
YOU KNOW, HOW SAD SHE WAS

14:51.875 --> 14:55.083
AND HOW MUCH SHE MISSED HIM.

14:55.125 --> 14:58.625
AND I STOPPED BEING HER KID.

14:58.667 --> 15:01.041
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS ALWAYS
TRYING TO KEEP ME BUSY,

15:01.083 --> 15:03.583
THINKING THAT... YOU KNOW,
THEN I WOULDN'T WORRY.

15:03.625 --> 15:06.083
SAME.
BUT THEN I WAS JUST
BUSY AND WORRIED,

15:06.125 --> 15:10.041
AND AFTER A WHILE, IT...

15:10.083 --> 15:12.083
WELL, IT WAS ALL TOO MUCH.

15:14.625 --> 15:16.542
I WORRY EVERY DAY.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.041
JULIE, LISTEN TO ME.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.834
THIS PROCEDURE...

15:22.875 --> 15:25.333
YOUR MOM COULD LIVE
THE REST OF HER LIFE

15:25.375 --> 15:28.041
WITHOUT EVER HAVING
ANOTHER SEIZURE.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.709
MY MOM THINKS THE SURGERY
IS A MISTAKE.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.250
AND I-I...

15:32.291 --> 15:34.667
I WANT WHAT SHE WANTS.

15:45.291 --> 15:47.041
KEEP YOUR EXPECTATIONS LOW,
OKAY?

15:47.083 --> 15:49.041
AND IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU KNOW,

15:49.083 --> 15:51.917
YOU CAN ALWAYS LEAVE WITHOUT
SEEING HER. THAT'S OKAY.

15:51.959 --> 15:55.041
NO HARM DONE. YOU SURE YOU
DON'T WANT ME TO GO WITH YOU?
NO, THAT'S OKAY. I'LL BE FINE.

15:55.083 --> 15:58.041
BUT THANKS.
OKAY. ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO FOR YOU?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.041
WHEN I GET HOME TONIGHT,

16:00.083 --> 16:02.917
I'M GONNA... WANT NUDITY,

16:02.959 --> 16:04.375
ALL KINDS OF NUDITY.

16:04.417 --> 16:06.875
ABSOLUTELY.
(chuckles)

16:06.917 --> 16:09.000
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

16:24.542 --> 16:26.792
WHAT?

16:26.834 --> 16:30.041
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING THAT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA WANT TO HEAR.

16:30.083 --> 16:33.041
THEN HOW ABOUT
YOU DON'T SAY IT?

16:33.083 --> 16:35.291
CAN YOU LISTEN, PLEASE?

16:35.333 --> 16:38.834
(sighs)

16:38.875 --> 16:41.000
YOU GOT 60 SECONDS.

16:41.041 --> 16:42.792
OKAY.

16:42.834 --> 16:44.959
UM...

16:48.875 --> 16:52.500
WHEN THEY PROSECUTED...

16:52.542 --> 16:54.834
MY RAPIST,

16:54.875 --> 16:56.834
UM, THERE WAS THIS WOMAN

16:56.875 --> 16:58.834
IN THE GALLERY
OF THE COURTROOM.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.041
AND SHE WATCHED,
AND SHE LISTENED

17:01.083 --> 17:03.583
TO WHAT I HAD GONE THROUGH,
AND SHE CAME EVERY DAY.

17:03.625 --> 17:05.583
AND THEN AT THE END
OF THE TRIAL,

17:05.625 --> 17:07.583
SHE, UH,
INTRODUCED HERSELF TO ME,

17:07.625 --> 17:09.959
AND SHE THANKED ME FOR, UH,

17:10.000 --> 17:13.458
FOR HAVING THE COURAGE
THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.625
TURNS OUT THAT HE HAD...
RAPED HER, TOO,

17:17.667 --> 17:19.125
ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE.

17:19.166 --> 17:21.583
AND I STARED AT HER

17:21.625 --> 17:25.834
AND I JUST WANTED TO...

17:25.875 --> 17:27.250
SLAP HER,

17:27.291 --> 17:30.625
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
IF SHE HAD COME FORWARD

17:30.667 --> 17:32.625
THEN MAYBE--MAYBE--

17:32.667 --> 17:34.625
I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN RAPED.

17:34.667 --> 17:36.083
SCREW YOU, VIOLET.

17:36.125 --> 17:38.834
CHARLOTTE...
THE LINEUP IS IMPORTANT.

17:38.875 --> 17:42.792
NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS,
I CAN TELL YOU FROM EXPERIENCE

17:42.834 --> 17:44.792
THAT IT IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

17:44.834 --> 17:47.417
TIME'S UP. GET OUT.

17:47.458 --> 17:50.458
(keyboard keys clicking)

17:54.125 --> 17:56.792
(door opens)

17:56.834 --> 17:58.792
(footsteps retreat)

17:58.834 --> 18:01.000
(door closes)

18:03.291 --> 18:05.041
(buzzer sounds)

18:05.083 --> 18:06.250
(speaks indistinctly)

18:06.291 --> 18:08.500
(emergency radio chatter)

18:08.542 --> 18:10.750
(clatters)

18:10.792 --> 18:14.166
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:16.083 --> 18:18.291
(door clatters)

18:18.333 --> 18:20.291
(man speaks indistinctly)

18:20.333 --> 18:23.291
(beeping continues)

18:23.333 --> 18:25.458
(door closes)

18:25.500 --> 18:26.917
(whispering) HI, MOM.

18:26.959 --> 18:29.083
HI.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.500
(beeping continues)

18:31.542 --> 18:33.917
HELLO, FRANCES.

18:33.959 --> 18:36.667
I WAS HOPING YOU'D COME.

18:45.625 --> 18:47.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

18:47.375 --> 18:50.458
YOU LOOK GOOD, PETER.
YOU FILLED OUT.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.291
(Adam) IT'S PETE NOW.

18:52.333 --> 18:55.458
OH, THAT SUITS YOU BETTER.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.375
OKAY. ANY CHEST PAINS,
PALPITATIONS?

18:58.417 --> 19:00.458
ADAM TELLS ME
YOU'RE REMARRIED

19:00.500 --> 19:03.333
AND YOU HAVE A SON.

19:03.375 --> 19:05.917
I'D LOVE TO HEAR ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY.

19:05.959 --> 19:08.500
WELL, HIS WIFE'S A DOCTOR.

19:08.542 --> 19:11.041
VIOLET. AND THEIR
LITTLE BOY LUCAS.

19:11.083 --> 19:12.500
LUCAS.
MM-HMM.

19:12.542 --> 19:16.291
THAT'S A GOOD NAME
FOR A BOY.

19:16.333 --> 19:18.291
WELL, YOUR CHART IS A MESS.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.625
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
ANY OF YOUR DOCTORS TALK ABOUT

19:20.667 --> 19:23.375
ELEVATED BLOOD PRESSURE,
HIGH LEVELS OF CHOLESTEROL,

19:23.417 --> 19:26.333
OR TRIGLYCERIDES?
I HARDLY EVER SEE A DOCTOR.

19:26.375 --> 19:28.333
THEY DON'T PAY
MUCH ATTENTION TO ME.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.041
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU'RE OLD
AND IN PRISON,

19:31.083 --> 19:33.625
SOMEBODY COMES AND CHECKS TO SEE
YOU'RE BREATHING,

19:33.667 --> 19:36.750
THEN THEY JUST MOVE ALONG.
UH, AND THAT'S WHY
PETE'S HERE,

19:36.792 --> 19:38.792
'CAUSE I TOLD HIM
HOW THEY TREAT YOU IN HERE

19:38.834 --> 19:40.834
AND--AND HOW BAD
YOU'VE BEEN FEELING.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.333
LET HER TALK
FOR HERSELF, ADAM.
YOUR BROTHER'S RIGHT.

19:43.375 --> 19:46.041
HE'S TRYING TO DO HIS JOB.
JUST LET HIM.

19:46.083 --> 19:49.083
YOU STILL SMOKING
AND DRINKING?

19:49.125 --> 19:51.375
NOT OFFICIALLY.
SOME THINGS DON'T CHANGE.

19:51.417 --> 19:54.166
NO MATTER HOW HARD
YOU TRY.

19:54.208 --> 19:57.375
(beeping continues)

19:58.917 --> 20:02.166
I--IT'S JUST
THAT WE'RE ALL TOGETHER AGAIN.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.250
YOU'RE A DOCTOR.

20:04.291 --> 20:07.333
AND HE'S A LAWYER.
(chuckles)

20:07.375 --> 20:09.875
WOULD YOU EVER IMAGINE?

20:11.291 --> 20:13.041
(voice breaks) IT'S NICE.

20:13.083 --> 20:15.250
(beeping continues)

20:15.291 --> 20:18.333
I'M SORRY. I WON'T...

20:18.375 --> 20:21.625
I'M SORRY.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.291
(coughs)

20:27.083 --> 20:28.417
(keys jangle)

20:28.458 --> 20:30.041
(lock clicks)

20:30.083 --> 20:31.291
(keys jangle)

20:31.333 --> 20:33.500
(door closes)
HEY.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.792
(keys clatter)

20:39.834 --> 20:41.250
OKAY.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.792
OKAY WHAT?

20:42.834 --> 20:44.667
I'LL DO THE LINEUP.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.041
(sighs)

20:50.083 --> 20:52.041
(kisses)

20:52.083 --> 20:55.000
I WILL CALL DETECTIVE PRICE.
WHEN DO YOU WANT TO GO IN?

20:55.041 --> 20:58.041
I THOUGHT I'D ASK VIOLET
TO GO WITH ME.

20:58.083 --> 21:00.333
OH. WHY?

21:00.375 --> 21:03.625
WELL, SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
THE SYSTEM... WITH KATIE.

21:03.667 --> 21:06.041
I THOUGHT IT WOULD
MAKE THINGS EASIER FOR ME

21:06.083 --> 21:07.500
TO HAVE HER THERE.

21:07.542 --> 21:09.500
IS THAT OKAY?

21:09.542 --> 21:12.500
SURE. OF COURSE.
WHATEVER IT TAKES.

21:16.667 --> 21:19.125
SHE'S DIFFERENT, RIGHT?

21:19.166 --> 21:21.917
35 YEARS IN JAIL,
IT CHANGED HER.

21:21.959 --> 21:23.417
HOW COULD IT NOT?

21:23.458 --> 21:25.208
IT DOESN'T CHANGE
WHAT HAPPENED.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.208
I'M NOT SAYING IT DOES.

21:27.250 --> 21:31.125
BUT WE CAN'T
LET HER DIE IN THERE.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.875
WASN'T ALL BAD.

21:32.917 --> 21:35.041
REMEMBER THE SWIMMING?

21:35.083 --> 21:37.542
SHE USED TO LET US SWIM
IN MR. KRAMER'S POOL

21:37.583 --> 21:40.041
WHENEVER HE WENT OUT OF TOWN.
WE WERE
BREAKING AND ENTERING.

21:40.083 --> 21:42.041
YEAH, BUT IT WAS
STILL SWIMMING.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.041
YOU LOVED IT.
WE ALL DID.

21:44.083 --> 21:45.750
A HOT SUMMER NIGHT,

21:45.792 --> 21:48.250
JUST THE THREE OF US,
SWIMMING AND LAUGHING.

21:48.291 --> 21:50.125
STOP IT.
STOP WHAT?

21:50.166 --> 21:52.959
STOP TRYING TO SELL HER TO ME
LIKE A USED CAR SALESMAN.

21:53.000 --> 21:55.542
I WAS THERE. I REMEMBER
EVERYTHING. THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

21:55.583 --> 21:58.041
I REMEMBER EVERYTHING.
WELL, MAYBE SHE'D DO IT
DIFFERENTLY IF SHE COULD.

21:58.083 --> 22:00.333
MAYBE SHE WOULDN'T.
I DON'T KNOW.

22:00.375 --> 22:02.709
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU HAVE A CHANCE

22:02.750 --> 22:05.041
TO DO SOMETHING RIGHT
FOR THIS FAMILY.

22:05.083 --> 22:08.083
SO IF YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT HER,
THAT'S FINE.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.375
BUT YOU DO THIS FOR ME.

22:14.542 --> 22:16.291
(knock on doorjamb)

22:16.333 --> 22:17.291
HEY.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.834
HEY.

22:18.875 --> 22:20.375
SO I SPOKE TO JULIE,

22:20.417 --> 22:22.500
AND I THINK SHE WANTS HER MOTHER
TO HAVE THE SURGERY NOW.

22:22.542 --> 22:25.083
FIRST OF ALL, YOU HAD
NO RIGHT TO TALK TO HER

22:25.125 --> 22:27.291
WITHOUT HER MOTHER'S CONSENT.
SECOND...

22:27.333 --> 22:29.083
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

22:29.125 --> 22:31.417
WELL, IT WASN'T EXPLICIT,
BUT I COULD TELL.

22:31.458 --> 22:33.417
EVEN IF YOU'RE RIGHT,
SHARON DOESN'T WANT IT.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.959
SHARON DOESN'T WANT IT
BECAUSE OF JULIE,

22:36.041 --> 22:38.583
BECAUSE YOU SCARED HER
AND MADE HER FEEL LIKE

22:38.625 --> 22:41.542
SHE WAS PLACING HER DAUGHTER
IN A TERRIBLE POSITION.
AMELIA--

22:41.583 --> 22:43.041
NO, IF WE DO NOTHING, JULIE
IS GONNA WAKE UP IN TEN YEARS,

22:43.083 --> 22:46.333
AND HER MOTHER
IS GONNA BE A VEGETABLE.
BUT JULIE WILL BE AN ADULT.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.959
I'M AN ADULT.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.583
DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS
I MISS MY FATHER ANY LESS?

22:51.625 --> 22:54.208
(voice breaking) HE NEVER
SAW ME BECOME A SURGEON.

22:54.250 --> 22:56.041
HE IS NOT GONNA WALK ME
DOWN THE AISLE.

22:56.083 --> 22:58.041
HE IS NOT GONNA SEE MY KIDS.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.041
I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING,
ADDISON...

23:00.083 --> 23:02.166
(crying)
ANYTHING TO HAVE HIM.

23:02.208 --> 23:04.166
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT
10 OR 15 GOOD YEARS.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.166
I AM TALKING ABOUT A LIFETIME.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.166
IF SOMEBODY WOULD'VE
GIVEN ME THE CHANCE

23:08.208 --> 23:10.458
TO HAVE HIM FOR ALL OF THAT...

23:15.083 --> 23:16.417
(sniffles)

23:16.458 --> 23:19.041
(footsteps retreat)

23:23.083 --> 23:24.875
EVEN IF SHE'S CHANGED,

23:24.917 --> 23:27.000
IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT
WHAT SHE DID DIDN'T HAPPEN.

23:27.041 --> 23:29.709
BUT IT ALSO DOESN'T MEAN
SHE CAN'T BE FORGIVEN.

23:31.625 --> 23:34.208
I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN GO THAT FAR.

23:34.250 --> 23:37.458
YOU FORGAVE ME.

23:43.959 --> 23:45.917
OH! I GOTTA WORK
ON MY TIMING.

23:45.959 --> 23:49.291
WELL, AT LEAST I GOT
MY PANTS ON THIS TIME.
(laughs)

23:49.333 --> 23:51.291
YEAH.
THANK YOU.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.417
NO, THANK YOU.
HEY, HUSBAND NUMBER TWO.

23:53.458 --> 23:55.333
STEP FORWARD. (chuckles)

23:55.375 --> 23:57.417
(inhales deeply)

23:57.458 --> 24:00.583
WHICH, UH,
CHEEK DID HE KISS?

24:00.625 --> 24:03.208
(laughs) WHAT IS THAT FOR?

24:03.250 --> 24:04.834
FOR TALKING TO CHARLOTTE.

24:04.875 --> 24:07.834
YOU DID TALK TO HER?
YOU CONVINCED HER?

24:07.875 --> 24:10.458
I SPOKE TO HER.
OH, THANK YOU.

24:10.500 --> 24:13.208
(sighs) WHAT TIME
ARE YOU GOING TO THE STATION?

24:13.250 --> 24:14.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

24:15.000 --> 24:16.542
FOR THE LINEUP.

24:16.583 --> 24:19.750
OH, CHARLOTTE WANTS YOU TO TAKE
HER. DID SHE NOT SAY ANYTHING?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.125
UH, OH. THEN I WILL.
OF COURSE. I WILL.

24:22.166 --> 24:23.750
YEAH.

24:26.041 --> 24:27.875
(indistinct conversations)

24:27.917 --> 24:29.041
HEY.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.250
HI.

24:30.291 --> 24:33.250
YOUR MOM SAID YOU WERE
DOWN HERE DOING YOUR HOMEWORK.

24:33.291 --> 24:36.041
YEAH, I AM. I WAS.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.041
I'M JUST--
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

24:39.083 --> 24:42.792
IF MY MOM'S SEIZURES
ARE HAPPENING CLOSER TOGETHER.

24:42.834 --> 24:45.000
I-I-I THINK THEY ARE.

24:45.041 --> 24:47.333
YOU TAKE GOOD CARE OF HER,
DON'T YOU?

24:47.375 --> 24:49.333
WE TAKE CARE OF EACH OTHER.

24:49.375 --> 24:51.125
SHE'S MY MOM, YOU KNOW?

24:51.166 --> 24:52.917
I DON'T, ACTUALLY.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.500
I'M NOT REALLY...
UH, BIZ--MY MOM AND I,

24:55.542 --> 24:57.500
WE'RE NOT, UH...
WE'RE NOT CLOSE.

24:57.542 --> 25:00.417
SO TO ME, HAVING TEN
GOOD YEARS WITH YOUR MOM,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.333
WELL, THAT SEEMS LIKE A LOT.
(chuckles)

25:02.375 --> 25:05.625
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE KIND OF RELATIONSHIP

25:05.667 --> 25:08.917
THAT THE TWO OF YOU HAVE--
YEAH, MY MOM'S AMAZING
AND BRAVE.

25:08.959 --> 25:12.041
I DON'T MIND DOING THIS.

25:12.083 --> 25:14.083
I REALLY DON'T.

25:14.125 --> 25:15.834
I'M SURE THAT
THAT'S TRUE,

25:15.875 --> 25:17.625
WHICH IS WHY I THINK

25:17.667 --> 25:21.041
THAT YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT
TO HAVE A SAY IN THIS.

25:21.083 --> 25:24.000
IF IT WERE UP TO YOU,
WHAT WOULD YOU WANT?

25:27.083 --> 25:29.583
NUMBER 1, STEP FORWARD.

25:29.625 --> 25:32.208
(switch clicks)

25:32.250 --> 25:34.375
NO.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.375
NUMBER 1,
STEP BACK.

25:36.417 --> 25:39.417
NUMBER 2, STEP FORWARD.
(switch clicks)

25:41.000 --> 25:42.458
STEP BACK, NUMBER 2.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.041
NUMBER 3, STEP FORWARD.

25:44.083 --> 25:45.792
(switch clicks)

25:48.083 --> 25:49.333
NO.

25:49.375 --> 25:51.834
NUMBER 3, STEP BACK.

25:51.875 --> 25:55.000
NUMBER 4, STEP FORWARD.
(switch clicks)

26:01.583 --> 26:04.000
HE'S NOT HERE.

26:06.083 --> 26:07.875
ARE YOU SURE?

26:07.917 --> 26:10.875
YES. I'M SURE.

26:18.083 --> 26:21.291
(door buzzes)

26:21.333 --> 26:23.458
HEY.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.000
DID SHE PICK OUR GUY?
SHE LOOKED HIM
STRAIGHT IN THE EYE

26:26.041 --> 26:28.000
AND SAID HE WASN'T THE ONE.
BUT SHE SAW HIM.

26:28.041 --> 26:30.709
SHE KNOWS HE'S THE GUY.
WELL, NOT ANYMORE.

26:30.750 --> 26:33.041
WELL, WHAT HAPPENS TO LEE?

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
(door buzzes)

26:35.083 --> 26:37.750
ASK HIM YOURSELF.

26:37.792 --> 26:40.041
YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET ENOUGH
OF THIS PLACE, CAN YOU, DOC?

26:40.083 --> 26:42.625
THERE'S PLENTY OF OTHER PLACES
I'D RATHER BE.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.458
WELL, THEN YOU AND I,
WE GOT SOMETHING IN COMMON.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.750
YOU'LL DO IT AGAIN, LEE.

26:47.792 --> 26:49.375
YOU'LL RAPE ANOTHER WOMAN.

26:51.333 --> 26:53.875
YOU DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF
THAT I DID IT.

26:53.917 --> 26:57.500
AND EVEN IF I DID DO IT,
IT DOESN'T MEAN I'D DO IT AGAIN.

26:57.542 --> 27:00.041
YOU THINK IF YOU KEEP TELLING
YOURSELF THAT, IT WON'T HAPPEN?

27:00.083 --> 27:02.834
THOSE FEELINGS?
THEY DON'T GO AWAY.

27:02.875 --> 27:05.875
AND WHEN THEY SURFACE? WELL,
WE BOTH KNOW WHAT HAPPENS.

27:05.917 --> 27:07.792
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.959
THAT WAS HIM, WASN'T IT--
NUMBER 4?

27:25.000 --> 27:27.875
NO.

27:27.917 --> 27:29.458
I SAW YOU, CHARLOTTE--

27:29.500 --> 27:31.375
THE WAY YOU REACTED
WHEN HE STEPPED FORWARD,

27:31.417 --> 27:33.375
THE WAY YOU LOOKED AT HIM.

27:33.417 --> 27:35.375
THAT WAS THE GUY
THAT ATTACKED YOU.

27:35.417 --> 27:36.875
I SAID NO.

27:36.917 --> 27:39.834
YOU DIDN'T BRING ME HERE
FOR MORAL SUPPORT, DID YOU?

27:39.875 --> 27:42.834
YOU WANTED A WITNESS TO GO
TELL COOPER THAT YOU HAD TRIED,

27:42.875 --> 27:44.834
BECAUSE IF HE HAD BEEN HERE,

27:44.875 --> 27:47.041
HE WOULD'VE SEEN
HOW YOU REACTED,

27:47.083 --> 27:49.083
AND HE WOULD'VE KNOWN, TOO.
CHARLOTTE, LISTEN TO ME.

27:49.125 --> 27:51.083
I HAVE BEEN THROUGH THIS,
AND THIS IS HARD--

27:51.125 --> 27:54.000
I AM SO SICK AND TIRED
OF HEARING ABOUT YOUR RAPE.

27:54.041 --> 27:55.625
THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO,

27:55.667 --> 27:58.041
AND YOU'RE STILL TALKING
ABOUT IT, HOW YOU GOT OVER IT.

27:58.083 --> 28:01.291
YAY, YOU. IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR?
NO, IT--THAT--

28:01.333 --> 28:04.208
IF YOU ASK ME, YOU ARE NOT
SO WHOLE AND NORMAL.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.208
YOU ARE NOT SO PUT TOGETHER.

28:06.250 --> 28:08.709
YOU ARE HIGH-STRUNG,
NEUROTIC,

28:08.750 --> 28:11.041
AND YOU STICK YOUR NOSE
INTO OTHER PEOPLE'S BUSINESS.

28:11.083 --> 28:14.834
THAT IS WHAT YOU DO,
AND I AM TIRED OF IT!

28:28.041 --> 28:29.667
HEY.

28:29.709 --> 28:32.041
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
AT MY MOTHER'S CHART.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.041
I THINK I FOUND SOMETHING.

28:34.083 --> 28:37.125
ALL RIGHT,
I SEE SOME MILD C.O.P.D.

28:37.166 --> 28:39.583
AND EVIDENCE OF
ATHEROSCLEROTIC HEART DISEASE,

28:39.625 --> 28:41.125
WHICH IS PRETTY STANDARD

28:41.166 --> 28:44.041
FROM A LONG-TERM SMOKER
YOUR MOTHER'S AGE.

28:44.083 --> 28:46.625
I SEE
RECURRENT IDIOPATHIC V-FIB.

28:46.667 --> 28:49.166
WELL, THAT'S A POTENTIALLY
LETHAL CONDITION,

28:49.208 --> 28:52.166
AND I DON'T SEE
ANY INDICATION OF THAT.

28:52.208 --> 28:54.041
RECURRENT V-FIB REQUIRES

28:54.083 --> 28:55.667
A SURGICALLY IMPLANTED
AUTOMATIC DEFIBRILLATOR,

28:55.709 --> 28:58.792
WHICH THEY CAN'T MONITOR
IN PRISON.

28:58.834 --> 29:00.333
IF SHE NEEDED IT,

29:00.375 --> 29:04.375
THEY'D PROBABLY JUST RELEASE HER
ON HUMANITARIAN GROUNDS.

29:04.417 --> 29:06.375
THEY WON'T ACCEPT A MEDICAL
RECOMMENDATION FROM ME.

29:06.417 --> 29:10.417
I'M FAMILY. BUT THEY WOULD
ACCEPT ONE FROM YOU.

29:10.458 --> 29:12.291
I KNOW WHAT I'M ASKING.

29:18.458 --> 29:20.458
HERE'S MY LETTERHEAD.

29:20.500 --> 29:23.750
WRITE WHATEVER YOU WANT ON IT,
AND I'LL SIGN IT.

29:33.166 --> 29:36.417

29:39.250 --> 29:42.291
ALL RIGHT. I'M GONNA GET

29:56.500 --> 29:58.375

29:58.417 --> 30:00.333

HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

30:00.375 --> 30:02.375
DADDY!
WHAT'S UP, BOY?

30:02.417 --> 30:04.166
COME ON.
HI.

30:04.208 --> 30:06.333
HOW WAS YOUR DAY, BIG GUY?
GOOD.

30:06.375 --> 30:08.333
YOU SLAY ANY MONSTERS?
YEAH?

30:08.375 --> 30:10.458
(woman laughs)

30:10.500 --> 30:11.917
(knocks on doorjamb)

30:11.959 --> 30:15.041
IF I GIVE THIS TO SAM,
HE SAID HE'D SIGN IT.

30:15.083 --> 30:17.166
I THINK I CAN GET HER OUT.

30:17.208 --> 30:19.375
YOU SURE THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

30:19.417 --> 30:21.792
I THINK SO.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.792
YES.

30:23.834 --> 30:26.834
AND YOU'RE OKAY
WITH THE FACT THAT IT'S--
IT'S A LIE?

30:26.875 --> 30:29.542
IF I WANT TO GET HER OUT,
I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

30:29.583 --> 30:31.917
WELL,
SOMETIMES LIES HURT PEOPLE,

30:31.959 --> 30:33.625
AND SOMETIMES
THEY PROTECT PEOPLE.

30:33.667 --> 30:35.625
CHARLOTTE DELIBERATELY
DIDN'T IDENTIFY HER ATTACKER

30:35.667 --> 30:37.625
IN THE LINEUP. SHE LIED.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.166
WHY?

30:39.208 --> 30:42.083
BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T
FACE UP TO IT,

30:42.125 --> 30:44.083
AND NOW SOMEONE ELSE
MIGHT GET HURT.

30:44.125 --> 30:47.041
WELL, MY MOM IS NOT
GONNA HURT ANYONE ELSE.

30:47.083 --> 30:50.667
WELL, MAYBE YOURS
IS A GOOD LIE.
