WEBVTT

00:09.098 --> 00:11.599
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

00:18.265 --> 00:21.432
"When we came here for the
first time in our lives,

00:21.515 --> 00:23.640
stood among people
who seem to understand,

00:23.724 --> 00:27.223
the sense of belonging
was tremendously exciting.

00:27.307 --> 00:29.181
We thought the ice... "...

00:29.265 --> 00:33.473
"isolation problem"...

00:33.557 --> 00:36.348
... "had been solved."

00:36.432 --> 00:39.890
"But as soon"...

00:41.265 --> 00:42.724
"We still"...

00:42.807 --> 00:44.890
What am I doing here?

00:44.973 --> 00:47.473
Stupid fucking Overeaters Anonymous.

00:47.557 --> 00:49.432
Why can't I read?

00:49.515 --> 00:52.140
My voice sounds strange.
It's like it's not even mine.

00:52.223 --> 00:54.307
... "listened to someone"...

00:54.390 --> 00:56.074
What am I doing here
in this stupid meeting,

00:56.098 --> 00:58.223
and why am I scared to talk?

00:58.307 --> 01:00.015
I shouldn't be scared of these people.

01:00.098 --> 01:02.515
Oh, just breathe, Eliza.

01:02.599 --> 01:05.098
Shit. What's wrong with me?

01:05.181 --> 01:07.223
It's time to talk now.

01:11.765 --> 01:13.807
This passage is my favorite.

01:13.890 --> 01:16.223
It reminds me to put the program first.

01:20.557 --> 01:23.390
We can't just
sit here in silence.

01:23.473 --> 01:24.991
We're not leaving here
till you talk about it.

01:25.015 --> 01:26.890
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:26.973 --> 01:28.640
I'll order another pizza.

01:28.724 --> 01:30.390
Just talk to me. What's up?

01:30.473 --> 01:32.390
Lize, we're not leaving

01:32.473 --> 01:34.307
until you tell me what's going on.

01:34.390 --> 01:36.432
I had a panic attack, okay?

01:36.515 --> 01:39.098
- In the middle of the meeting?
- Yes.

01:39.181 --> 01:41.140
Why? It's supposed to be a safe space.

01:41.223 --> 01:43.181
Yeah, it's weird. I haven't had one

01:43.265 --> 01:46.098
since my dad sent me to NASA Space Camp.

01:46.181 --> 01:48.473
Wow. You went to Space Camp?

01:48.557 --> 01:50.098
My dad was convinced

01:50.181 --> 01:53.140
I was gonna be the first
black female astronaut.

01:53.223 --> 01:55.307
Oh, my God. Imagine Eliza in space.

01:55.390 --> 01:58.098
I really hate it when
people expect shit from me.

01:58.181 --> 02:00.432
- She's flying around space.
- Are you listening to me?

02:00.515 --> 02:02.890
- You should've done it.
- This is about the MCATs.

02:02.973 --> 02:05.015
- The test?
- Yes, the test!

02:05.098 --> 02:06.724
Oh. Well, then just don't take it.

02:06.807 --> 02:08.556
- So just start over?
- Why not?

02:08.639 --> 02:10.306
Look at me. I haven't even started yet.

02:10.389 --> 02:11.890
- Bridge.
- What?

02:11.973 --> 02:13.432
I'm gonna be a doctor.

02:13.515 --> 02:14.700
Maybe it's the wrong decision.

02:14.724 --> 02:16.890
I'm gonna be a doctor.

02:16.973 --> 02:19.557
I'm going to medical school.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.015
Oh, thank you.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.515
Don't even. Don't even look at it.

02:24.599 --> 02:27.056
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.348
Listen to this. "If you want to do

02:29.432 --> 02:30.931
something about your kid's hair,

02:31.015 --> 02:34.390
I braid at Maribel's Salon."

02:34.473 --> 02:35.765
Damn.

02:35.849 --> 02:37.307
What's wrong with my kid's hair?

02:37.390 --> 02:38.390
No comment.

02:38.473 --> 02:40.098
You like your hair?

02:40.181 --> 02:42.348
No.

02:42.432 --> 02:44.432
Where's Maribel's? Who's Johanny?

02:51.056 --> 02:54.599
It's okay.

02:54.682 --> 02:56.307
Maybe you're braiding too tight.

02:56.390 --> 02:58.140
No, he's just tender-headed. He's fine.

02:58.223 --> 03:00.181
Could you do a little looser braid?

03:00.265 --> 03:01.785
Mira... mmm. Mmm, here you go.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.557
Like a French braid, maybe?

03:06.432 --> 03:09.181
Maybe if Mommy got her
hair done too, you know,

03:09.265 --> 03:10.599
he wouldn't be so scared.

03:10.682 --> 03:12.223
Yeah?

03:12.307 --> 03:15.515
Oh. I like the upsell. Congratulations.

03:15.599 --> 03:18.348
I love getting my hair done.
Okay, what should we do?

03:18.432 --> 03:20.599
Well, I can straighten
it, or you can get rows

03:20.682 --> 03:22.322
- like the little man.
- Oh, I'll do rows.

03:22.348 --> 03:23.575
That's not culturally
insensitive, is it?

03:23.599 --> 03:26.181
Nah. I mean, you're
not, like, white-white.

03:26.265 --> 03:28.348
Right? Yeah, you get it.

03:28.432 --> 03:30.432
And I've never told anyone this,

03:30.515 --> 03:33.181
but I think in a past
life, I was a slave.

03:33.265 --> 03:35.849
- What? Did she say... ?
- Yeah, um, you...

03:35.931 --> 03:39.098
probably should just keep on
never telling that to anybody.

03:39.181 --> 03:41.390
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:41.473 --> 03:44.432
But it's my truth. Ow.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.599
That's really tight. Oh, my God. Ow.

03:47.682 --> 03:51.015
Ow! Ow. Larry, hold my hand.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.724
Oof.

03:56.807 --> 03:58.807
It's kind of itchy. Does it itch you?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.931
- Uh-uh.
- No? Does it hurt?

04:01.015 --> 04:02.265
- Mm.
- You like it?

04:02.348 --> 04:04.265
- Oh, my!
- Hi!

04:04.348 --> 04:07.390
- Wow!
- Nice.

04:07.473 --> 04:09.307
- Buddy. It looks good.
- Twinning.

04:09.390 --> 04:11.973
- I like it.
- Should we go in?

04:12.056 --> 04:15.098
Actually, could we, um, talk
to you privately for a minute?

04:15.181 --> 04:17.223
- Oh. Without Larry?
- Is that okay?

04:17.307 --> 04:19.307
Okay.

04:19.390 --> 04:22.181
Be right back. Nelson wants
to have an adult conversation.

04:22.265 --> 04:25.473
- Sorry.
- Princess Nelly.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.890
That was surprisingly easy.

04:27.973 --> 04:30.015
- What's up?
- Let's... let's take a seat.

04:30.098 --> 04:32.181
- Oh. Okay.
- Follow me.

04:32.265 --> 04:34.931
Oh, no. Is it bad? Do
you have Lyme disease?

04:35.015 --> 04:36.765
Why would I have Lyme disease?

04:36.849 --> 04:38.724
'Cause it's going around, and you seem

04:38.807 --> 04:40.181
really lethargic lately.

04:40.265 --> 04:41.807
No, it's actually good news, all right?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.724
Oh, okay.

04:43.807 --> 04:46.515
So, Gonzalez-Taylor-Bird
family meeting in session...

04:46.599 --> 04:49.348
You're the spitting image
of my ex-girlfriend Meredith.

04:49.432 --> 04:51.724
- Who, me or her?
- No, you.

04:51.807 --> 04:53.307
Oh. Thanks. That's so nice.

04:53.390 --> 04:56.015
- She was from a rich family.
- Oh.

04:56.098 --> 04:58.307
She got sucked into
that whole AT&T thing.

04:58.390 --> 05:01.432
She got hit in the head.
Her brain got all scrambled.

05:01.515 --> 05:04.640
- She's on disability now.
- Oh, no. I'm so sorry.

05:04.724 --> 05:06.533
- Wasn't meant to be.
- Yeah, sometimes it's just

05:06.557 --> 05:08.557
- not meant to be.
- I still love her though.

05:08.640 --> 05:10.307
- Really?
- This one time...

05:10.390 --> 05:12.140
Um, sorry to interrupt.
Touching story, bro.

05:12.223 --> 05:14.183
I'm sorry that all of that
happened, but we really

05:14.223 --> 05:16.140
- gotta talk to her.
- I'll talk to you later.

05:16.223 --> 05:17.682
Yeah, yeah. We'll listen later.

05:17.765 --> 05:19.348
We gotta tell you something, Bridge.

05:19.432 --> 05:21.265
- Okay.
- We are...

05:21.348 --> 05:23.807
Getting married!

05:23.890 --> 05:26.140
What? Really?

05:26.223 --> 05:28.140
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

05:28.223 --> 05:30.223
We're gonna go to Puerto Rico to do it.

05:30.307 --> 05:32.307
Oh, my God, a magical
Puerto Rican wedding.

05:32.390 --> 05:34.348
- I can't wait.
- Oh, Bridge, it's gonna be,

05:34.432 --> 05:36.348
you know, super small and, you know,

05:36.432 --> 05:38.557
his family'll know that you're his ex

05:38.640 --> 05:41.890
and... and we didn't wanna
make you feel uncomfortable.

05:41.973 --> 05:44.307
- Oh, yeah.
- The flights are outrageous,

05:44.390 --> 05:46.557
so...
- I get it. I totally get it.

05:46.640 --> 05:48.973
It's gonna be super tiny,
and I know you hate flying.

05:49.056 --> 05:50.973
Mm-hmm. And is Larry invited?

05:51.056 --> 05:52.223
- Yeah.
- Of course.

05:52.307 --> 05:54.265
- Oh.
- Princess Nelly!

05:54.348 --> 05:57.098
- Oh, hi! Yeah, I'll come play.
- Oh.

05:57.181 --> 05:59.890
- Princess Nelly!
- "Princess Nelly!"

05:59.973 --> 06:01.599
Wow.

06:01.682 --> 06:04.265
- You cool?
- Yeah, of course I'm cool.

06:04.348 --> 06:06.765
- This is so exciting.
- Are you sure?

06:06.849 --> 06:09.307
Yeah. No more broken homes for Larry.

06:09.390 --> 06:11.348
At least, one less broken home.

06:11.432 --> 06:13.515
Where's my phone?

06:13.599 --> 06:17.557
Can you just call it?
Let me see if it's here.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.682
- Where am I in your phone?
- Under "Bridgette Bird."

06:20.765 --> 06:23.307
Not "Baby Mama"?

06:23.390 --> 06:26.223
- It's just your name.
- You changed it?

06:26.307 --> 06:28.973
I don't know. It just kind of felt...

06:29.056 --> 06:31.098
Here, just call it.

06:34.348 --> 06:36.849
- It's ringing.
- I can't... it's ringing?

06:36.931 --> 06:38.682
Stop throwing stuff everywhere.

06:38.765 --> 06:40.157
What are you doing? Stop.

06:40.181 --> 06:41.890
Oh, here it is.

06:41.973 --> 06:44.390
- Here, let me help.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:44.473 --> 06:45.640
Got it. Thanks, man.

06:45.724 --> 06:47.515
- All right.
- Thank you.

06:47.599 --> 06:50.181
"Decline." And I'm changing
your name to "Fuckface."

I was just telling Allan

07:11.015 --> 07:13.348
how well you've been
doing at that MCAT prep.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.348
Following in the family footsteps.

07:15.432 --> 07:17.807
Have you decided what you're
gonna specialize in yet?

07:17.890 --> 07:19.283
- Mm-mm.
- I'm guessing it's not

07:19.307 --> 07:20.765
urology like your dad.

07:20.849 --> 07:22.682
Well, I would make a urology joke,

07:22.765 --> 07:24.515
but they really piss me off.

07:26.807 --> 07:29.223
- Always like that.

07:34.181 --> 07:35.807
- "Feet don't talk back."
- They stink,

07:35.890 --> 07:36.907
- but they don't talk back.
- Medically, they can't.

07:36.931 --> 07:38.765
You're right.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.575
- Let me try...
- I mean... yeah, yeah.

07:40.599 --> 07:42.324
Options, you know. It's
just a lot of options.

07:42.348 --> 07:44.015
- Yeah, yeah.
- Um, the potato salad...

07:44.098 --> 07:45.408
I need to take the Saran wrap off.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.223
Okay. All right, all right. All right.

07:47.307 --> 07:48.640
Bring the bowl.

07:56.473 --> 07:58.265
- 'Sup?
- Bridge,

07:58.348 --> 08:00.056
can you come to my dad's barbecue

08:00.140 --> 08:03.515
and... and bring me weed?
Um, I'm freaking out.

08:03.599 --> 08:06.015
Um, okay, well, my only hookup's my mom.

08:06.098 --> 08:08.557
Okay, can you go to
Tutu's and get weed, please?

08:08.640 --> 08:10.849
Please? I literally can't function.

08:10.931 --> 08:13.140
Okay. I mean, I could get high too.

08:13.223 --> 08:15.473
I'm having an interesting day.
- Just come.

08:15.557 --> 08:16.837
- Okay, I'll be over soon.
- Bye.

08:16.890 --> 08:19.724
Larry, we gotta go get some weed.

08:23.348 --> 08:25.098
You know that lobsters are considered

08:25.181 --> 08:26.849
the cockroaches of the ocean?

08:26.931 --> 08:28.682
- Oh.
- I read it on Snapple.

08:28.765 --> 08:31.265
- ♪ Ask any lobster ♪
- Oh, what?

08:31.348 --> 08:33.181

♪ The cockroach of the ocean ♪

08:34.599 --> 08:36.140
Yeah, that's not the song, though.

08:36.222 --> 08:37.890
Hi, guys. Here.

08:37.972 --> 08:39.849
What the hell happened to your hair?

08:39.931 --> 08:41.307
Okay, can I have the weed, please?

08:41.390 --> 08:43.140
- We smoked it.
- Oh, precious.

08:43.222 --> 08:44.366
What do you mean you smoked it?

08:44.390 --> 08:45.765
It's all done. We smoked it all.

08:45.849 --> 08:47.724
- Baby bye-bye.
- You just told me

08:47.807 --> 08:49.241
- to come here and pick it up.
- Not just, Bridgette.

08:49.265 --> 08:50.949
- You were two hours ago.
- Twenty minutes ago.

08:50.973 --> 08:52.408
- No, it was two hours.
- Twenty minutes ago.

08:52.432 --> 08:53.783
Look at how much food we ordered today.

08:53.807 --> 08:55.557
- It was two hours.
- What is going on here?

08:55.640 --> 08:57.074
- How much are you smoking?
- We're microdosing.

08:57.098 --> 08:58.724
- Little bits.
- You're macrodosing

08:58.807 --> 09:00.283
- is what it is.
- She has some. She has it.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.056
- Maria. She's got it.
- She's holding.

09:02.140 --> 09:04.366
- What do you mean, she has...
- Indica, sativa, CBD oil.

09:04.390 --> 09:06.098
- Maria, right there.
- Shh.

09:06.181 --> 09:07.491
- Boston legalized.
- I can get it here?

09:07.515 --> 09:09.455
- Yeah.
- What's good for panic attacks?

09:09.456 --> 09:10.557
Are you upset?

09:10.640 --> 09:11.783
- What are you panicking about?
- What do I get?

09:11.807 --> 09:13.098
What do I ask for?

09:13.181 --> 09:15.348
Granddaddy purple.

09:15.432 --> 09:16.783
All right, well, you're paying for it.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.682
Okay. Ms. Maruyama,

09:18.765 --> 09:21.432
- may we have some...
- Shh. You're in public.

09:21.515 --> 09:23.682
- Hey, baby.
- Hey. How are you?

09:23.765 --> 09:26.807
Um, do you happen to have
some granddaddy purple?

09:26.890 --> 09:28.890
Look at our little... look what we got.

09:28.973 --> 09:30.890
- Do you like that?
- Ooh, he likes...

09:30.973 --> 09:32.223
Larry, I like your hair.

09:32.307 --> 09:33.640
Okay, well, that was easy enough.

09:33.724 --> 09:35.241
Now I don't have to
go through you anymore.

09:35.265 --> 09:36.390
- Come on.
- Oh, that's nice.

09:36.473 --> 09:38.348
Cut your mother out. That's very sweet.

09:38.432 --> 09:40.890
Honey, your hair looks
like that Bo lady.

09:40.973 --> 09:42.724
- Bo, uh...
- Derek.

09:42.807 --> 09:44.849
- Bo Derek.
- Bye.

09:44.931 --> 09:47.807
And Derek was that guy they
killed on Grey's Anatomy.

09:47.890 --> 09:50.181
Remember? It was so sad.
He was the lead, too.

09:50.265 --> 09:52.432

11:06.973 --> 11:08.931
Oh, so you guys are related?

11:09.015 --> 11:12.015
Yeah, yeah. Like... like play cousins.

- This?

11:27.265 --> 11:28.599
These are called cornrows.

11:28.682 --> 11:30.473
I don't know if you're familiar.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.432
- Definitely familiar.

Uh, I mean, how
long are you gonna keep it?

11:34.432 --> 11:36.074
I don't know. Should I take
it out? I should take it out.

11:36.098 --> 11:37.765
- Will you do it for me?
- No.

11:37.849 --> 11:40.056

Oh! Hey, Phil.

12:32.640 --> 12:35.390
- Uh, "lip."
- Lip.

12:35.473 --> 12:37.931
- Phillip.
- Okay.

12:38.015 --> 12:41.307
Yeah, yeah. Bridgette, have
you met Eliza's aunties?

12:41.390 --> 12:43.473
- Hi.
- This is Valerie and Renee.

12:43.557 --> 12:45.056
- Hello.
- Well, go ahead

12:45.140 --> 12:46.741
and put him down. Let
him play with the others.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.515
Oh. You wanna play with the kids?

12:48.599 --> 12:49.682
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

12:49.765 --> 12:51.432
You know my son better than I do.

12:51.515 --> 12:53.098
- Come with Phillip.
- Bye.

12:53.181 --> 12:56.223
- Oh, he is beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

12:56.307 --> 12:59.223
- His father black?
- Oh, no, Puerto Rican.

12:59.307 --> 13:02.015
- Oh, black adjacent.
- Mm-hmm.

13:02.098 --> 13:04.557
Mm-hmm. Righ' next door.

13:04.640 --> 13:06.557
- Mm-mm, Bridge.
- No, I was kidding.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.140
Mm-hmm.

13:08.223 --> 13:09.491
Lize, I didn't know you had aunties.

13:09.515 --> 13:10.849
- Yeah.
- And I didn't know

13:10.931 --> 13:12.807
Eliza had a white friend with cornrows.

13:12.890 --> 13:14.807
- Oh.
- Hey, speaking

13:14.890 --> 13:16.682
- of cornrows.
- Me neither.

13:16.765 --> 13:19.557
- Yeah, this is my daughter.
- Oh, yeah, we met.

13:19.640 --> 13:21.599
You both have, uh, sons the same age.

13:21.682 --> 13:23.515
- Oh, really?
- But this one

13:23.599 --> 13:26.307
- doesn't have a man.
- Um, I have plenty of men.

13:26.390 --> 13:28.390
I got plenty of men too.

13:28.473 --> 13:30.313
But actually, not really
since my son was born.

13:30.348 --> 13:32.056
Oh, what happen to your man? He die?

13:32.140 --> 13:34.015
Oh, no, nothing like that. I mean,

13:34.098 --> 13:36.265
- he might have Lyme disease.
- Oh.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.682
You know, stay out of the woods.

13:38.765 --> 13:41.473
Uh, um, he did propose
to me. So that happened.

13:41.557 --> 13:42.807
- Oh!
- But I said no.

13:42.890 --> 13:44.515
- But I could've, so...
- Sweetheart?

13:44.599 --> 13:46.015
- What?
- You can always

13:46.098 --> 13:47.765
- change your mind.
- Like tomorrow.

13:47.849 --> 13:49.432
Well, I can't actually,

13:49.515 --> 13:51.265
'cause he just proposed
to his girlfriend.

13:51.348 --> 13:52.807
- What? Wait.
- Oh, sweetie.

13:52.890 --> 13:54.241
Yeah, I just found out this morning.

13:54.265 --> 13:55.491
They're getting married in Puerto Rico.

13:55.515 --> 13:56.682
Guess who's not invited?

13:56.765 --> 13:58.557
- What?
- This girl.

13:58.640 --> 13:59.825
- Bridge.
- Who would wanna go

13:59.849 --> 14:01.890
- to somebody...
- No, I think it's

14:01.973 --> 14:04.015
a good thing for everyone.
For the whole family.

14:04.098 --> 14:06.432
- I don't know about that.
- No, no, no.

14:06.515 --> 14:08.973
Look, Bebe's baby's
father married someone else

14:09.056 --> 14:12.098
and now that woman is
getting all the attention.

14:12.181 --> 14:14.765
Now she and poor Barry
have to fend for themselves.

14:14.849 --> 14:16.473
Oh, my God, that sounds terrible.

14:16.557 --> 14:19.015
- It is.
- Who's poor Barry?

14:19.098 --> 14:21.265
Oh, it's my son. It's,
like, short for Barack.

14:21.348 --> 14:23.265
- Your son's name is Barry?
- Mm-hmm.

14:23.348 --> 14:25.640
My son's name is literally Larry.

14:25.724 --> 14:27.640
- No way.

14:27.724 --> 14:30.432

- Hey.

18:42.557 --> 18:45.140
I'm here for our date.

18:45.223 --> 18:48.390
Huh. Cute hair. You're two weeks late.

18:48.473 --> 18:52.056
I know. Traffic was terrible.

18:52.140 --> 18:54.557
The key is cheese in the pan first.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.098
- Sizzling. Mm-hmm.
- In. Yeah.

18:57.181 --> 18:58.973
- Can I have some?
- Yeah.

18:59.056 --> 19:00.599
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:00.682 --> 19:02.765
Mmm. Wait, you put cheese on the bottom?

19:02.849 --> 19:05.181
Yeah, it crisps up
if you keep it on low.

- Exactly.
- This is so yummy.

19:08.682 --> 19:10.181
- Yeah.
- I love cheese.

19:10.265 --> 19:12.056
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm. I do. I love it.

19:12.140 --> 19:14.181
All right, for the rest of your life,

19:14.265 --> 19:16.682
would you rather give
up cheese or oral sex?

19:16.765 --> 19:19.765
Hmm?

19:19.849 --> 19:22.098
That is a really tough question.

19:22.181 --> 19:24.181
Mm.

19:24.265 --> 19:25.931
- What would you choose?
- Lucky for me,

19:26.015 --> 19:28.140
- I don't have to choose.
- Why not?

19:28.223 --> 19:30.599
Oh, you know. 'Cause...

19:30.682 --> 19:32.724
vaginas taste like cheese.

19:32.807 --> 19:34.931
- No, they don't.
- Some do.

19:35.015 --> 19:36.348
- They do? I...
- I mean...

19:36.432 --> 19:38.724
I don't think my vagina
tastes like cheese.

19:38.807 --> 19:39.973
What does yours taste like?

19:40.056 --> 19:41.931
What do you think it tastes like?

19:42.015 --> 19:44.265
If I had to guess...

19:44.348 --> 19:46.765
- Cornichons.
- Cornish hens?

19:46.849 --> 19:48.682
Cute little baby chickens?

19:48.765 --> 19:50.390
No, cornichons.

19:50.473 --> 19:51.783
They're like these little
miniscule French pickles

19:51.807 --> 19:54.098
made of gherkin cucumbers,
like, two inches long.

19:54.181 --> 19:56.056
- You've seen 'em.
- Aww.

19:56.140 --> 19:58.140
- Yeah.
- You think my vagina tastes

19:58.223 --> 19:59.890
like little rich people pickles?

19:59.973 --> 20:02.307
- I guess. It would be acidic.
- Mmm.

20:02.390 --> 20:05.181
- They sound yummy.
- Do you wanna find out?

20:05.265 --> 20:07.307
Mm...

20:16.015 --> 20:18.223
The quesadilla's gonna burn.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.807
Take off your fucking
shirt. I wanna see your tits.

20:43.473 --> 20:46.599
My dick's so hard.

20:46.682 --> 20:50.473
Feel how hard you make my dick.

20:50.557 --> 20:52.432
S-so hard.

20:52.515 --> 20:54.640
Yeah, you wanna taste my hard dick?

20:54.724 --> 20:56.557
Wanna put it in your fucking mouth?

20:56.640 --> 20:58.181
- Yeah, I wanna...
- Yeah?

20:58.265 --> 20:59.432
... taste your hard dick.

20:59.515 --> 21:01.682
And I wanna put it in my mouth.

21:01.765 --> 21:03.682
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm, and...

21:03.765 --> 21:05.599
- Is your pussy so wet?
- My pussy's...

21:05.682 --> 21:07.015
Tell me how wet your pussy is.

21:07.098 --> 21:08.223
- So wet.
- Yeah?

21:08.307 --> 21:10.724
It's like an ocean.

21:10.807 --> 21:13.074
I wanted to fuck you ever since
that day at the tattoo shop.

21:13.098 --> 21:15.348
- Me too.
- I can't wait to put my

21:15.432 --> 21:18.307
- throbbing cock inside you.
- Oh, yeah.

21:18.390 --> 21:21.015
- Oh, yeah.
- Where do you want it?

21:21.098 --> 21:22.849
Inside my tight, wet pussy?

21:22.931 --> 21:24.473
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:24.557 --> 21:26.807
- Whoa.
- Show me where you want it.

21:26.890 --> 21:29.265
Uh, not in my butt.

21:29.348 --> 21:31.890
Oh.

21:31.973 --> 21:34.724
Yeah.

21:34.807 --> 21:38.056
Yeah.

21:38.140 --> 21:40.515
Your dog is so cute.

21:40.599 --> 21:43.140
Yeah.

21:46.181 --> 21:48.098
Oh! Yeah.

21:53.557 --> 21:55.557
Yeah.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.181
Oh, God.

21:58.265 --> 22:00.390
- I'm gonna come.
- Ah! Me too!

22:00.473 --> 22:03.181
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, I'm gonna co...

22:03.265 --> 22:05.765
Oh! Oh!

22:13.765 --> 22:15.473
Oh. You didn't come in me, did you?

22:15.557 --> 22:18.307
- No.
- Okay.

22:43.348 --> 22:46.307
Hey, when'd you text me?

22:50.765 --> 22:51.765
What?

22:54.682 --> 22:55.849
What the fuck, Bridge?

22:55.931 --> 22:57.181
What?

22:57.265 --> 22:59.432
"The sex with this dude is so bad.

22:59.515 --> 23:00.557
How's the cookout?"

23:00.640 --> 23:01.973
I didn't mean to text you that.

23:02.056 --> 23:03.557
I thought you liked it.

23:06.098 --> 23:09.223
- I don't know.
- Then why didn't you stop it?

23:09.307 --> 23:12.265
- Well, you were very into it.
- Wasn't that  into it.

23:13.390 --> 23:15.390
What?

23:15.473 --> 23:17.849
How could you not
have been that into it?

23:17.931 --> 23:19.140
What do you mean?

23:21.390 --> 23:24.056
What do you mean you
weren't that into it?

23:24.140 --> 23:25.807
I mean, like, it was good,

23:25.890 --> 23:28.583
but I thought you came over here
because you wanted to hook up.

23:28.586 --> 23:31.682
Let's just say I came
over here to have sex.

23:31.765 --> 23:33.616
It doesn't mean I wanna
star in my own fucking porn.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.223
You were the one acting all porny.

23:35.307 --> 23:36.390
I  was?

23:36.473 --> 23:37.765
"Inside my tight, wet, pussy"?

23:37.849 --> 23:39.265
Yeah, after you asked where

23:39.348 --> 23:41.307
I wanted your "throbbing cock."

23:41.390 --> 23:43.640
You know, you said, "Take off your shirt

23:43.724 --> 23:46.931
and show me your tits" like
two seconds into the night.

23:49.390 --> 23:51.682
I thought we were into each other.

23:54.348 --> 23:56.390
I thought we were getting married.

24:01.307 --> 24:05.599
Um...

24:05.682 --> 24:07.557
guess it was just a bad date.

24:09.473 --> 24:10.765
Yeah.

24:10.849 --> 24:12.473
Here, I can help you with that.

24:12.557 --> 24:14.223
No, it's okay. I got it.

24:14.307 --> 24:16.599
Here. Here, I can just do it.

24:16.682 --> 24:17.682
I got it.

24:19.973 --> 24:21.390
I shouldn't be here.

24:23.849 --> 24:26.223
I'm gonna go.

24:26.307 --> 24:28.473
Okay.

24:28.557 --> 24:33.015
Do you want me to
call you an Uber, or...

24:33.098 --> 24:35.682
It's okay. I use Lyft.

24:51.432 --> 24:53.056
- Did you have fun?
- Mm-hmm.

24:53.140 --> 24:55.515
I danced with Hakim.

24:55.599 --> 24:57.682
He taught me how to
do, um, the stanky leg.

24:57.765 --> 24:59.682
Ooh, let me see your stanky leg, then.

24:59.765 --> 25:02.140
- Ooh, ooh.
- Mm-hmm.

25:02.223 --> 25:03.682
- Ooh, it's stanky. Ooh.
- Mm-hmm!

25:06.390 --> 25:08.640
Oh, my goodness. I'm so happy you came.

25:08.724 --> 25:11.015
So much dancing. I've never
been to a party like that.

25:11.098 --> 25:13.682
Yeah. I'm glad you got
to meet my sorors too.

25:13.765 --> 25:16.265
Yeah. I didn't know you
had this whole other life.

25:16.348 --> 25:18.432
- Yeah, you did.
- No... fine.

25:18.515 --> 25:22.265
But I didn't know you didn't
want me to be part of it.

25:22.348 --> 25:25.015
- I invited you over.
- To bring you weed.

25:25.098 --> 25:27.515
Yeah, but once you got
there, I could relax.

25:27.599 --> 25:30.098
- Well, 'cause we were high.
- No.

25:30.181 --> 25:32.682
No. Because you're my
girl and I wanted you there

25:32.765 --> 25:35.181
and my family drives me crazy.

25:35.265 --> 25:37.890
I do have a "whole other life,"

25:37.973 --> 25:40.265
and it's black as hell.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.140
And I know you wanna be...

25:44.223 --> 25:46.682
- But you're not black.
- I know.

25:46.765 --> 25:48.265
I'm sorry I'm so needy.

25:48.348 --> 25:51.473
You are not needy. My family is needy.

25:54.265 --> 25:56.181
- Bridgette.
- Mm-hmm?

25:56.265 --> 25:59.348
Hey. The sex was that bad, Bridge?

25:59.432 --> 26:00.931
It was not great.

26:01.015 --> 26:02.056
I'm sorry.

26:06.056 --> 26:09.140
Why aren't they inviting me?

26:09.223 --> 26:11.140
To their wedding?

26:12.724 --> 26:14.515
I don't get...

26:14.599 --> 26:17.890
Hey. Fuck them.

26:17.973 --> 26:19.765
You hear me?

26:19.849 --> 26:22.181
Fuck Nelson and fuck Rafi.

26:22.265 --> 26:23.890
You should be there with your kid.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.807
Why do I even wanna go to the wedding?

26:25.890 --> 26:27.557
Because. Because you care about them.

26:27.640 --> 26:29.348
- I wanna go.
- And they should've

26:29.432 --> 26:30.658
- fucking invited you.
- I know.

26:30.682 --> 26:33.348
And you've been the best baby mama ever.

26:33.432 --> 26:34.931
- Do you hear me?
- Mm-hmm.

26:35.015 --> 26:36.265
I got you, cuz.

26:37.849 --> 26:39.724
Can I really be your play cousin?

26:40.849 --> 26:42.640
"Play cousin"?

26:42.724 --> 26:45.098
You are my cousin.

26:45.181 --> 26:47.181
We family.

26:47.265 --> 26:49.765
Family that eats
together stays together.

26:49.849 --> 26:52.640
- But I got one condition.
- What?

26:52.724 --> 26:55.348
We gotta take them damn cornrows out.

26:55.432 --> 26:56.866
- Like, what?
- Please help me

26:56.890 --> 26:58.348
- take them out.
- Gosh!

26:58.432 --> 26:59.807
- Oh, my God.
- Girl.

26:59.890 --> 27:01.640
Oh, my God, I hate 'em so much.

27:01.724 --> 27:03.807
- Come here. Come here.
- I feel really stupid.

27:03.890 --> 27:06.348
- No, you don't look stupid.
- Oh, thank you.

27:06.432 --> 27:07.907
I can get 'em out in
30. This is what I do.

27:07.931 --> 27:10.973
Really? Ooh, it's really itchy.
