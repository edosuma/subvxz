WEBVTT

01:09.360 --> 01:10.528
Thank you.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.156
My loyal subjects,

01:13.656 --> 01:16.201
tonight is not a night of celebration.

01:17.035 --> 01:19.496
Tonight is a night

01:19.579 --> 01:20.413
of judgment.

01:22.415 --> 01:23.917
Golidriyule of Gilgar,

01:24.709 --> 01:28.213
you have humiliated yourself in battle.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.216
What's more, you have bothered me,
your quest manager,

01:31.299 --> 01:32.926
with your constant complaining.

01:34.511 --> 01:37.722
As the eldest goblin of our sect,

01:37.806 --> 01:39.390
I call upon a vote.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.102
Do we banish

01:42.185 --> 01:46.564
Golidriyule of Gilgar
from Gilgarath forever?

01:46.648 --> 01:49.692
-Aye!

01:49.776 --> 01:51.945
So, it is decided.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.239
Golidriyule of Gilgar,

01:54.989 --> 01:56.407
hand me your sword.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.201
Not so fast.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.955
As the current quest champion,

02:02.539 --> 02:04.124
you require my vote.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.544
The vote of Glenwyn of Galganthian.

02:08.128 --> 02:11.131
Now, this poor soul must stay.

02:11.798 --> 02:14.259
Because he literally
has nowhere else to go.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.343
-Like, at all.

02:15.426 --> 02:18.429
-Never thought of that.
-If anyone opposes me,

02:18.513 --> 02:21.766
you are much welcome to taste my steel.

02:21.850 --> 02:22.976
Not I.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.937
He steals my snacks every week, Amily.
He has to go.

02:26.020 --> 02:28.523
Steve, can you please
stop breaking character?

02:28.606 --> 02:30.358
-Cut it out.
-Oh.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.569
Who here opposes me?

02:34.028 --> 02:37.574
You're in character. Right, Amily?
I mean, it's a simple misunderstanding.

02:37.657 --> 02:40.535
-Oh, yeah. We're totally good.
-So I still have a ride home?

02:40.618 --> 02:42.412
-Yeah, for sure. Come on.
-Thank you.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.581
-Ogre!
-Aah!

02:44.664 --> 02:46.332
Prepare to die.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.586
-And so the battle begins!

02:54.883 --> 02:57.886
-<i>Wow, you're good at combat.</i>
-<i>You're so fierce.</i>

02:57.969 --> 03:00.638
I really am, you know,
when you watch it back like this.

03:14.485 --> 03:17.447
Usually, I'm on
a combo of Vicodin and steroids.

03:17.530 --> 03:19.908
So I can't really vouch for my actions.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.326
-Really?
-Oh yeah.

03:21.409 --> 03:24.495
Sometimes I'm like, "I can't believe
my heart's still beating."

03:27.874 --> 03:31.002
<i>Suck it, Vernon! Fuck you!</i>
<i>I'm not going anywhere, man.</i>

03:31.085 --> 03:32.503
<i>-Hey, hey. It's role play.</i>
<i>-Whoo!</i>

03:32.587 --> 03:34.589
-<i>Role play, not real.</i>
-Are you okay?

03:34.672 --> 03:36.549
-Sorry. What?
-Are you okay? You seem distracted.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.928
Oh! Uh, yeah. No, I--
I just keep thinking that

03:40.011 --> 03:44.098
there's gotta be something more I can do
to help out the cause.

03:44.182 --> 03:47.435
I volunteered to do a TED Talk,
and I was impolitely declined.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.396
We tried the skywriter.
They misspelled everything.

03:50.980 --> 03:52.982
I may have been
the weak link in that chain.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.609
May?

03:54.692 --> 03:56.778
-Whatever happened--
-It was definitely Tom.

03:56.861 --> 03:58.905
He always misspells everything.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.741
-Um, however it went down--
-Tom is clearly at fault.

04:01.824 --> 04:04.577
-Yeah. It's Tom.
-Guys, I did the mea culpa.

04:04.661 --> 04:05.703
Got it.

04:05.787 --> 04:10.083
In your defense, I mean, you know,
it's hard to throw yourself out there

04:10.166 --> 04:13.211
when Satan is literally trying
to track you down to murder you.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.463
That's true. That is true.

04:15.546 --> 04:19.467
But I feel like somebody smarter,
or braver, or wiser--

04:19.550 --> 04:22.804
Clark, you've done everything you've
been asked to do up to this point.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.682
And one good thing did happen.
God saved your dad.

04:25.765 --> 04:27.892
-Using me as a conduit.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.229
Lest we forget. It's kind of a big deal
when you think about it.

04:31.312 --> 04:33.940
How could we ever forget?
You always harp on about it.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.817
It just feels like you forget.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.902
-Hey, whoa. Speaking of.

04:38.403 --> 04:39.821
Hey, Pop. How you doin'?

04:39.904 --> 04:41.155
Say hello from me!

04:41.239 --> 04:43.491
<i>Clark, where you been?</i>

04:43.574 --> 04:44.867
Well, I told you. At work.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.786
You told me to leave because it was weird

04:46.869 --> 04:48.955
going to the bathroom
with people that close to you.

04:49.038 --> 04:51.416
Is-- I can come right back.
Is everything okay?

04:51.916 --> 04:53.501
<i>The food here is killing me.</i>

04:54.127 --> 04:57.422
I need our favorite dish to heal.
My mom's recipe.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.466
<i>Yeah. The perfect roast chicken</i>
<i>with Hasselback potatoes?</i>

05:00.550 --> 05:01.592
<i>No problem. You got it.</i>

05:01.676 --> 05:04.512
Clark, please.
I wouldn't ask this if it wasn't--

05:04.595 --> 05:06.014
No problem. I'm happy to do it.

05:06.097 --> 05:07.849
<i>Oh, please, Clark. I wouldn't ask--</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:08.975
No, I said yes.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.728
<i>Oh. Okay-- Okay, great. I just, uh…</i>

05:11.811 --> 05:14.439
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I imagined there would be more pushback.</i>

05:14.522 --> 05:16.607
No, I said yes. Easy.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.152
<i>Hi, Gene! Hi!</i>

05:19.235 --> 05:22.071
-Amily, is that you?
-Hey. I'm so glad you're feeling better.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.991
<i>Have you made Amily the-- the chicken yet?</i>

05:26.117 --> 05:27.994
<i>You know, the chicken's the clincher.</i>

05:28.077 --> 05:30.997
-No. No, I haven't. Not yet, Pop.
<i>-Chicken's the clincher.</i>

05:31.080 --> 05:33.166
I will have the perfect roast chicken
for you tonight.

05:33.249 --> 05:35.043
<i>Oh! I can't wait.</i>

05:35.126 --> 05:36.252
Chicken's the clincher.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.755
Yeah. That's thrice now you've said it.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.507
Goodbye, my precious, wonderful son.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.301
<i>Bye, Gene!</i>

05:43.384 --> 05:44.469
Bye!

05:45.595 --> 05:47.472
Heard about the chicken?
It's the clincher.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.682
-Oh, I hadn't heard that yet.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.573
No way, Tom.

06:05.656 --> 06:06.866
-What?
-You always do this.

06:06.949 --> 06:08.993
It's so weird. There's so many stalls.

06:09.077 --> 06:11.120
That's really funny. man.
Look, I've been thinking--

06:11.204 --> 06:14.082
I'm stopping you right there.
We're not having a conversation.

06:14.165 --> 06:16.959
If I'm Tom the Baptist,
what does that make you?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.169
First of all, I'm Muslim--

06:18.252 --> 06:20.254
Oh my God,
we're having a conversation.

06:20.338 --> 06:24.258
Okay, so right there. Muslim. That's
way different from Christianity, right?

06:24.342 --> 06:25.968
No, not really. Uh…

06:27.261 --> 06:30.014
Look, I can tell you
that Muslims worship God.

06:30.098 --> 06:33.101
And we believe that Muhammad
is his prophet. Peace be upon him.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.310
Instead of Jesus?

06:34.394 --> 06:37.230
No. We believe
that Jesus is a prophet too.

06:37.313 --> 06:40.608
But we follow the teachings of Muhammad.
Peace be upon him. All right?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.945
And it's all the same God.
It's not a bunch of different Gods.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.697
Jews, Muslims, Christians. Same God.

06:46.781 --> 06:51.452
It's the God that Clark
apparently spoke to in this bathroom.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.663
Yeah. You know, for whatever reason,

06:53.746 --> 06:55.665
I thought there were,
like, a million gods?

06:55.748 --> 06:59.252
-Yeah, well
-I suppose I'm not that spiritual.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.338
But God did work through me.

07:02.880 --> 07:05.466
Yeah, you've mentioned that to me,
like, 55 million times.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.927
I wanna see if telepathy's
one of my new powers.

07:08.010 --> 07:11.139
Okay, I'm sending you a message
with my mind. It's a question.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.058
-I'm not getting it.
-Damn it!

07:14.934 --> 07:17.145
Okay, the question was,
do you still go to church?

07:17.228 --> 07:18.187
You mean the mosque.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.522
Uh-hmm-hmm?

07:19.605 --> 07:21.691
A mosque is a place of worship
for Muslims.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.318
Okay, stop treating me like I'm dumb.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.695
-Just, do you go or not?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.613
No, I don't really. I mean, I…

07:27.697 --> 07:30.074
I guess I'm kind of like a lapsed Muslim.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.952
You know, I sort of fell away
from religion as I got older,

07:33.035 --> 07:34.579
like a lot of people do.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.916
That's probably why God
was talking to Clark in the first place.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.044
He probably wants to know
how many people still believe.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.797
Wow. That's pretty deep.

07:47.758 --> 07:52.054
I suppose I'm having trouble understanding
why God chose to work through me.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.014
Tom.

07:53.681 --> 07:57.185
And I promise you this is the last thing
I'm going to say to you from this stall.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.938
But I think the reason
God chose to work through you

08:01.022 --> 08:02.482
is because you had…

08:03.649 --> 08:05.610
a purpose, right, in that moment.

08:06.986 --> 08:08.154
And you were true.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.491
You know,
Clark says that all religions are true.

08:11.574 --> 08:15.411
So it's not that you're
John the Baptist or Tom the Baptist,

08:15.495 --> 08:19.790
or that you're from a particular religion
or a religious guy, it's just…

08:21.709 --> 08:24.378
You did something good
in a moment that was blessed.

08:25.379 --> 08:28.382
-Wow.
-Now, please, get the fuck outta here.

08:28.466 --> 08:29.634
Yeah. Sure, yeah.

08:30.843 --> 08:34.847
Hey, do you even use the bathroom?
You say you go, like, many times a day.

08:34.931 --> 08:36.307
No.

08:36.390 --> 08:39.477
I use the ones downstairs.
I value my privacy, man.

08:41.062 --> 08:43.356
-Hey, Jack.
-Jesus Christ, Tom.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.400
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

08:48.277 --> 08:51.447
Coffee today?
I didn't think that was your jam.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.451
Yeah, you know. I'm just, uh…
I'm just trying it.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.370
-Oof.
-Pungent?

08:57.453 --> 08:58.871
It's so coffee-y.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.082
Yeah. Hey.

09:01.165 --> 09:04.126
I wanted to quickly say that
I thought that it was so sweet

09:04.210 --> 09:07.004
how you decided
to help make chicken for Clark's dad.

09:07.088 --> 09:11.300
Oh. It's not a big deal.
I mean, the guy was in a coma, you know?

09:11.384 --> 09:14.470
I think he has earned
some magic grandma chicken.

09:15.638 --> 09:17.974
Feels like kind of a big deal though. No?

09:18.558 --> 09:21.227
I don't know. I haven't, uh…
I haven't tasted it yet.

09:21.310 --> 09:24.230
Not the chicken.
Though that does sound wonderful.

09:25.231 --> 09:29.443
I think I more mean the fact that
Gene is your boyfriend's dad.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.113
-You're making him a family recipe.

09:32.196 --> 09:34.490
-It's really wholesome. It's nice.
-Ew…

09:35.491 --> 09:38.035
So have you said anything yet?

09:38.119 --> 09:39.662
A certain three words?

09:40.371 --> 09:41.581
The big three words?

09:42.331 --> 09:44.875
I don't know what three words
you're talking about.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.921
"Is it contagious,"
or "It looks infected"?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.089
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

09:50.172 --> 09:52.049
So funny. You always do this.

09:52.133 --> 09:55.720
You always deflect from answering
my questions which you find tedious.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.680
You're pretty weird.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.891
You're like the weirdest one.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.519
-I'm the weirdest?
-You're the weirdest one.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.731
I've-- I've seen weirder,
but you're the weirdest one by far.

10:06.814 --> 10:09.775
Okay, so what?
So sue me for being secretly weird.

10:09.859 --> 10:12.069
I feel like you are getting
weirder by the minute.

10:12.153 --> 10:14.363
You're doing a lot of hand modeling today.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.491
-Oh, it changes. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.
-It is. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.244
-She can move. Pah. Pah.
-Oh. Oh. Robotic hinges.

10:20.328 --> 10:22.288
-Oil can.
-Pah. Pah,

10:22.371 --> 10:24.248
-This is what we do. This is what we do.
-Can!

10:24.332 --> 10:26.542
-For our morning coffee. Oh, here they go.
-Ch. Ch. Ch.

10:26.626 --> 10:30.296
-Robots. Those probably need a little oil.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.381
-That's cool. Hey, um…

10:32.465 --> 10:36.510
I thought I might do my chicken journey
if you're still up for it. No pressure.

10:36.594 --> 10:38.596
No. I'll-- I'll totally go with you.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.806
I-- I only show up to work
to hang out with this one.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.369
<i>I think you're nice too.</i>

11:01.952 --> 11:03.954
<i>I'm not sure of the next best steps.</i>

11:04.455 --> 11:06.832
<i>Let's say they're whatever</i>
<i>you want them to be.</i>

11:08.042 --> 11:09.877
<i>Also, I'm hoping we don't die soon.</i>

11:10.544 --> 11:12.546
<i>Sincerely, Mohsin Raza.</i>

11:18.386 --> 11:22.181
I think it's really sweet that
you're making your dad's favorite meal.

11:22.264 --> 11:24.100
Well, it is pretty perfect.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.602
-I hear it's the clincher.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.354
-Didn't need leeks.
-Oh.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.438
Hup, hup!

11:30.147 --> 11:32.191
-Okay. Don't-- don't need apples.
-Hup. Hup.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.819
-Don't need apples. Don't need apples--
-Hup. Oh, one of these?

11:34.902 --> 11:37.363
-Oh. Okay. Thank you.
-Ooh.

11:38.322 --> 11:41.492
-Green stuff. Here you go.
-Thank you. Thank you, uh--

11:41.575 --> 11:42.952
I think I have everything I need.

11:43.035 --> 11:44.578
-Except for the chicken.
-More green.

11:44.662 --> 11:47.039
Yeah. You wanna go
check out the chicken aisle?

11:47.123 --> 11:48.124
-Yeah, sure.
-Cool.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.471
Ooh, premium chicken.

12:03.931 --> 12:04.974
Ooh!

12:05.057 --> 12:07.351
Oh, I would ask you
not to throw raw chicken at me, please.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.145
I can't make any promises.

12:11.272 --> 12:12.773
-Yah!

12:19.155 --> 12:20.489
-Earthquake.

12:20.573 --> 12:21.949
-Oh no.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.201
-Come on, come on! Yah!
-Go, go, go, go, go!

12:24.285 --> 12:25.411
-Go, go, go!

12:26.203 --> 12:27.204
Go!

12:28.706 --> 12:30.708
Get out! Run!

12:30.791 --> 12:32.460
-Ooh! Let's go!
-Clark!

12:32.543 --> 12:34.545
-Oh, my gosh! Go! Go!

12:35.129 --> 12:36.839
-Run!

12:38.174 --> 12:40.050
-There they go!
-Run!

12:47.099 --> 12:49.185
-Oh! What the hell?
-Easy, easy.

12:50.478 --> 12:51.312
Yah!

12:56.525 --> 12:57.526
So you guys are LARPers?

12:57.610 --> 13:01.238
There's an amazing
cowboy LARPing group up in Malibu

13:01.322 --> 13:05.034
-that I think you would be perfect for.
-We ain't LARPers. Whatever that may be.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.328
Okay, then what…

13:07.411 --> 13:09.497
-What the hell are you?

13:09.580 --> 13:13.042
We are the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse, little lady.

13:13.125 --> 13:14.293
Horse people.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.504
I feel you, sister.

13:17.213 --> 13:19.673
Okay, so that would make you
War, Famine, Pestilence, and Death.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.884
So, um, pretty cool.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.219
You know, introductions, right?

13:23.302 --> 13:26.013
Uh, you know, 'cause it's just
a little odd to be meeting you.

13:26.096 --> 13:27.807
-I'm Clark. This is Amily.
-I'm Amily.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.809
I'm assuming, sir, that you are Death?

13:31.143 --> 13:32.061
I'm Pestilence.

13:32.144 --> 13:34.355
-He's Pestilence. Yes, I was…
-I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

13:34.438 --> 13:37.024
-So, uh… Death?
-War.

13:37.107 --> 13:38.192
-Sorry. Apologies.
-Yeah.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.694
-So that would make you…
-Uh…

13:40.778 --> 13:41.821
Death.

13:41.904 --> 13:43.781
I am known as Famine.

13:44.365 --> 13:46.033
-Famine. Famine…
-Cool.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.829
Process of elimination. You are Death.

13:49.912 --> 13:51.914
-Yes.
-Got it. Got it.

13:51.997 --> 13:54.083
Our coming has been foretold.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.336
Our beginning
foretells the ending of all else.

13:58.337 --> 14:00.381
-What the fuck does that mean?
-I think, Amily,

14:00.464 --> 14:02.424
-he's discussing the incoming apocalypse.
-I--

14:02.508 --> 14:04.593
That's what you're here to usher in,
I'm assuming?

14:04.677 --> 14:08.180
And, uh, you know, I'm assuming,
because you're here and it's in a store,

14:08.264 --> 14:10.391
uh, we're talking about
kind of a right now situation?

14:10.474 --> 14:12.518
Oh, you're absolutely correct.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.812
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.982
-Oh, Jesus. Shit.
-Great. Shit.

14:18.065 --> 14:19.358
Uh, so, uh…

14:19.441 --> 14:22.653
You know, if you don't mind me asking,
what side, uh, are you on?

14:22.736 --> 14:25.197
-Did God send you, or Lucifer--
-Enough questions.

14:25.281 --> 14:28.284
We can't bring in the apocalypse
until we bring you in, Clark.

14:28.367 --> 14:30.953
So how's this gonna go?

14:32.538 --> 14:33.414
The easy way?

14:34.331 --> 14:35.499
Or the hard way?

14:39.044 --> 14:40.421
-Ouch.
-Go, go, go.

14:40.504 --> 14:42.256
Go, go, go! Okay, okay!

14:42.339 --> 14:44.550
-Eat a sandwich!
-Gotta go! Oh, my gosh!

14:44.633 --> 14:46.010
Keep the change!

14:46.552 --> 14:47.970
Gonna need a minute, fellas.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.139
Oh, gosh. Oh, my gosh.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.894
Wow. This is really serious.

14:55.853 --> 14:58.689
I mean, if the Four Horsemen
are really here, which they are,

14:58.772 --> 15:01.775
that either means
that God is losing the war in Heaven

15:02.359 --> 15:04.695
or has lost patience with us.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.989
It does kind of seem like that,
doesn't it? I just…

15:07.072 --> 15:09.825
-I wish I could do more to help.
-What are you talking about?

15:09.909 --> 15:12.286
-You're amazing. You do everything.
-I couldn't help your dad.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.163
Tom helped your dad, and I'm so glad--

15:14.246 --> 15:17.708
You took on a Horseman of the Apocalypse,
and you won.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.211
I just wish I could do more
than kick a guy in the dick.

15:21.795 --> 15:23.297
Aw. You're so nice.

15:24.256 --> 15:26.675
I mean,
if this is really close to the end,

15:26.759 --> 15:29.595
I'm just so happy that you're with me.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.013
Me too.

15:31.722 --> 15:32.890
Meaning you.

15:32.973 --> 15:36.101
-Not meaning I'm glad I'm with myself.
-With yourself.

15:36.185 --> 15:37.561
I'm glad I'm with you.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.105
That's what I mean. I don't know…

15:40.189 --> 15:42.274
-Maybe it's not the end of the world.

15:42.358 --> 15:44.318
Sometimes the good guys win, right?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.531
I feel the very strong urge to pray.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.744
Oh, you mean like an urge urge?
Oh. All right. I'm in.

15:54.536 --> 15:57.373
-Dear God.
-Oh, God!

15:57.456 --> 15:59.458
No wonder Catholics are so cranky.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.919
First of all,
thank you so much for everything.

16:02.544 --> 16:07.174
Secondly, I'm really sorry I haven't done
a better job of getting your message out.

16:07.257 --> 16:08.509
Sorry!

16:08.592 --> 16:11.887
Thirdly, the Four Horsemen
of the Apocalypse are here,

16:11.971 --> 16:13.847
and things are seeming pretty dire.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.766
It's gettin' weird.

16:15.849 --> 16:16.809
Fourthly,

16:17.851 --> 16:20.062
I don't know what the next steps are.

16:21.355 --> 16:25.609
Fifthly, and I'm sorry, normally people
just go to three, I went to five…

16:26.110 --> 16:28.988
But if you could
give us any kind of a sign,

16:29.989 --> 16:31.281
we would really appreciate it.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.161
Holy shit. I think it worked.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.501
I am very disappointed in you, son.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.005
About what now, Mom?

16:46.088 --> 16:48.674
About lying to the world. That's what.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.385
Your lies are leading to bad things.

16:51.885 --> 16:56.557
There were people pretending to be Riders
of the Apocalypse in the grocery store.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.768
Those people were not pretending.
Those are the real Riders.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.395
This is a very serious situation.

17:01.478 --> 17:04.606
Preposterous.
They frightened the shit out of everyone.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.983
My friend Katharine was there,

17:06.066 --> 17:09.611
and she texted me
a sea of useless, frightened emojis.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.823
I think it's all because of you, Clark,
and I didn't raise you to lie.

17:12.906 --> 17:14.283
Uh Dad raised me, Mom.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.076
I mean, come on.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.579
What's the secret of the glowing trick?

17:18.662 --> 17:22.458
What? Have you got a remote control
in your backside or something?

17:22.541 --> 17:25.252
Is that the best version of glowing
people can come up with?

17:25.335 --> 17:28.756
Also, I know your father isn't well.

17:28.839 --> 17:31.175
I should go pay my final respects.

17:31.258 --> 17:35.512
Actually, he had a miraculous recovery,
Mom. So that's great news.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.347
He was a good man. A good father.

17:37.431 --> 17:39.558
You're not listening to me,
and that is not new.

17:39.641 --> 17:42.561
The only reason I left you two
to your own devices

17:42.644 --> 17:45.147
was because you were always so close.

17:46.023 --> 17:46.857
Who is this?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.401
Oh, this? This is Amily.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.736
Hello, Emily.

17:50.819 --> 17:52.488
It's Amily with an "A."

17:53.363 --> 17:54.573
Wouldn't that be Aimily?

17:55.157 --> 17:58.911
I don't know. I'm not a dictionary,
Clark's Mom. I know it's pronounced Amily.

17:58.994 --> 18:04.249
My name is Helen. As in Helen
of fucking Troy. Thank you very much.

18:04.333 --> 18:06.877
Oh, thank you for this elixir.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.837
Eh. I like her.

18:08.921 --> 18:12.591
Even though she has shown up
at exactly the same time

18:12.674 --> 18:16.470
that your life has swirled
into a web of deceit and trash,

18:16.553 --> 18:19.014
which is most certainly not a coincidence.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.600
Please tell me
you're not having premarital sex.

18:22.476 --> 18:23.310
Oh, Mom.

18:23.393 --> 18:25.604
I know I haven't been
the best mother to you.

18:25.687 --> 18:29.066
Even though nobody ever
talks about how difficult it is

18:29.149 --> 18:30.943
for the mother to leave.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.363
-Oof.
-But I have to advise you as best I can.

18:34.446 --> 18:38.617
So I'm saying stop lying to America.

18:38.700 --> 18:41.161
And say no premarital nookie.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.705
-Mom.
-No way.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.250
Absolutely not. No.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.879
You can tell me that I'm bad and I'm wrong
as much as you want.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.589
You can even deny the apocalypse.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.175
But I'm not gonna let you bring Amily

18:55.259 --> 18:58.262
into your extraordinary brand
of bull-roar.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.724
You have never spoken to me
like that in your entire life.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.893
Well, I've never had the reason to.

19:04.977 --> 19:07.521
But I will not
have you speak that way about Amily.

19:07.604 --> 19:09.857
She's the best of us.
I won't stand for it.

19:11.692 --> 19:12.734
Thanks, Clarky.

19:12.818 --> 19:13.694
"Clarky"?

19:14.236 --> 19:16.196
He's not a porcelain doll, Amily.

19:16.697 --> 19:21.118
I'm going to take my leave
before someone says something I'll regret.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.207
I mean it, son. Stop with the bullshit.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.464
-That's my mom, everybody.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.052
C'mon, Wendy. You've been there forever!

19:39.136 --> 19:41.597
Stop lurking outside the bathroom, Tom!

19:41.680 --> 19:43.182
I do not wanna come out in this.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.601
I have mine on. Does that help or hurt?

19:49.146 --> 19:51.315
Oh, you've got to be shitting me.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.649
What?

19:53.192 --> 19:57.279
Wendy, Council of Clark sweatshirts.
We're official! You look amazing.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.991
Could you stop storming off
and use your words, please?

20:01.074 --> 20:03.118
Okay, fine. I will use my words.

20:03.202 --> 20:07.247
You can't make Council of Clark into
an acronym and slap it on a sweatshirt,

20:07.331 --> 20:08.749
because it clearly says "cock."

20:08.832 --> 20:11.501
Guys, it means Council of Clark.

20:12.211 --> 20:15.464
As Tom the Baptist, I decree them sacred.
So say we all.

20:15.547 --> 20:18.467
There's a small problem with that.
You didn't baptize anybody.

20:18.550 --> 20:20.844
Wh-- You guys were there.

20:20.928 --> 20:25.390
My single tear fell onto Gene and it
brought him to life. Therefore, Baptist.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.685
It takes way more
than a single tear to baptize somebody.

20:28.769 --> 20:31.355
-I'd say at least a quarter cup.
-Quarter cup.

20:31.438 --> 20:33.815
-Oh!
-Gosh, we are so in sync. Thank you.

20:33.899 --> 20:35.901
Okay, who cares? The sweatshirts stay.

20:35.984 --> 20:39.112
They're codified and sanctified and must
be worn by every member of the group.

20:39.196 --> 20:41.740
I'm not wearing it.
It clearly says "cock" on it, Tom.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.450
As a proud feminist, I won't wear anything

20:43.533 --> 20:45.285
that reinforces
the patriarchical upper hand.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.371
-FTP. Fuck the patriarchy.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.998
Am I going crazy?
Cock has a "K" in it. A "K!"

20:50.082 --> 20:51.625
It's at least cock-adjacent, Tom.

20:51.708 --> 20:53.543
-Yeah.
-It's just letters, guys.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.713
I promise you,
no one anywhere will read this as "cock."

20:57.756 --> 20:59.049
Cock. Cock.

21:00.217 --> 21:04.888
Cock… I gotta cock corp… Call corporate.
I gotta call corporate. Cock!

21:15.691 --> 21:16.775
Oh, I like it.

21:17.359 --> 21:19.278
I mean, the chicken is-- is perfect.

21:19.361 --> 21:22.072
And the skin, perfection.

21:22.656 --> 21:25.117
And the potatoes are nice.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.537
Uh-oh. The chicken was perfection,
but the potatoes are just nice?

21:28.620 --> 21:31.123
Well, you know,
I'm just saying that it's, uh…

21:31.206 --> 21:34.001
It's okay to experiment
with potatoes, you know?

21:34.668 --> 21:36.169
Have a little fun spicin' 'em up.

21:36.253 --> 21:40.048
Well, I mean, in our defense,
we did encounter four evil horse people…

21:40.132 --> 21:41.800
-True.
-…while we tried to get ingredients.

21:41.883 --> 21:43.635
-And then Mom showed up.
-Mom?

21:45.012 --> 21:45.846
What did she say?

21:45.929 --> 21:48.432
So you wanna skip over
the four evil horse people part?

21:48.515 --> 21:50.600
By the way,
they foretell the coming apocalypse.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.436
-Oh.
-But Mom…

21:52.519 --> 21:55.147
Well, Mom was just,
I guess, doin'… Mom stuff.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.898
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah.

21:56.982 --> 22:01.403
-She was not kind to Amily.
-She did not care for any of this.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.989
Oh. You spoke your mind, didn't you, son?

22:04.072 --> 22:05.699
You know what? I did.

22:05.782 --> 22:07.743
-Good.
-He really let her have it.

22:09.411 --> 22:10.620
I appreciate him.

22:11.121 --> 22:14.333
Well, I can't thank you enough
for this delicious meal.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.752
It reminds me of my mom.

22:16.835 --> 22:18.837
Oh! I'm glad.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.757
Amily, could a man have a finer son?

22:22.341 --> 22:23.342
I don't see how.

22:27.054 --> 22:30.432
My God. I haven't even
tried the magic chicken. Okay.

22:32.642 --> 22:33.477
Oh my God.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.689
Oh my God.
That is so… It's like beyond perfect.

22:37.773 --> 22:39.191
Unbelievable. That skin.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.818
What did I tell ya? It's the clincher.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.111
It's the clincher.

22:43.695 --> 22:45.614
-Sorry, guys.

22:46.448 --> 22:49.117
-This is a blocked FaceTime.
-Go ahead and answer it.

22:49.785 --> 22:52.454
It could be the gas company
and they're coming to turn off your gas.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.831
Never pick up a blocked number.
Blocked FaceTime?

22:54.915 --> 22:56.917
-Pick it up.
-You can't block a FaceTime.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.002
-Do not pick that up.
-Pick it up.

22:59.086 --> 23:00.295
-No.
-Answer the phone.

23:00.379 --> 23:01.421
-Okay.

23:02.214 --> 23:03.465
<i>Hi there, dipshit.</i>

23:04.091 --> 23:05.842
<i>Weren't you wondering where I've been?</i>

23:05.926 --> 23:08.845
<i>Well, I'll tell you.</i>
<i>I just got back from killing Chamuel.</i>

23:08.929 --> 23:09.971
<i>That's right.</i>

23:10.055 --> 23:14.184
<i>It took a while, but I finally slit</i>
<i>his neck like a turkey, and now he's dead!</i>

23:14.267 --> 23:17.479
<i>And he screamed</i>
<i>and cried like a baby the whole time.</i>

23:17.562 --> 23:19.981
<i>Ooh! Guess what? God's dead too.</i>

23:20.065 --> 23:21.316
-No.
<i>-Yeah!</i>

23:21.400 --> 23:23.902
<i>It's over. Why do you think</i>
<i>the horsemen were unleashed?</i>

23:23.985 --> 23:24.903
She's lying.

23:25.487 --> 23:27.531
We know you're lying! We're not buying it!

23:28.115 --> 23:30.492
<i>Hi, best friend! You know I'm not.</i>

23:30.575 --> 23:34.454
And now I'm right outside
your little hospital.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.499
Ooh! Hi, doc! Nice scrubs.

23:38.041 --> 23:41.294
Frisbee's stupid Hogwarts spell
can't keep me out of there forever.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.881
And once I get in there, you're all dead.

23:44.965 --> 23:48.176
<i>Then I'm going to torture your souls</i>
<i>in Hell forever.</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:51.304
<i>Okay, I think that's it.</i>

23:51.388 --> 23:52.806
<i>I'll see you soon! Bye!</i>

23:59.396 --> 24:01.356
The gas company doesn't FaceTime.
