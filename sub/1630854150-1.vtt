01:45.544 --> 01:48.380
Keep your eyes open.

01:48.415 --> 01:50.811
Watch the roof.

01:53.981 --> 01:56.190
Boys, watch your- 00.

02:02.297 --> 02:04.627
Right.
Keep your eyes open.

02:04.662 --> 02:06.563
Well, Obama called it.

02:06.598 --> 02:08.433
Should have detoured this place.

02:14.441 --> 02:16.243
Come on, pretty boy.

02:16.278 --> 02:18.740
Couple more hours,
we'll be out of here.

02:18.775 --> 02:20.412
Moving forward, sir.

02:23.483 --> 02:25.483
motherfucker.

02:31.557 --> 02:33.425
- Jake, watch him.

02:34.791 --> 02:35.790
He's got an IED.

02:35.825 --> 02:37.264
He hasn't primed it.

02:37.299 --> 02:38.958
Jake, it's protocol, man.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.565
motherfucker.

02:41.600 --> 02:43.270
-In position.
-Watch him.

02:43.305 --> 02:45.338
You got 3 seconds.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.735
-3...

02:46.770 --> 02:48.308
...2...

02:48.343 --> 02:49.342
1.

02:49.377 --> 02:50.343
- Watch him!

02:50.378 --> 02:51.509
Take the shot.

02:54.547 --> 02:56.349
Damn it.

02:58.485 --> 02:59.649
- All clear.

02:59.684 --> 03:01.552
Damn it, Jake.

03:01.587 --> 03:02.916
What's your status, Atherton?

03:02.951 --> 03:04.390
- Sir.

03:04.425 --> 03:05.952
MAN #- Keep your eyes open.

03:05.987 --> 03:08.658
We got one dead informant.

03:08.693 --> 03:10.264
MAN #- Careful.

03:10.299 --> 03:13.498
- And an emplaced IED, sir.

03:13.533 --> 03:15.566
He was priming it for us.

03:17.636 --> 03:20.439
It's a 9-volt battery.

03:20.474 --> 03:23.904
Do I have permission
to cut, sir?

03:23.939 --> 03:25.939
Don't. Just -- Just come back.

03:25.974 --> 03:27.446
I can see it, sir.

03:27.481 --> 03:29.041
We got to go,
whatever you're doing.

03:29.076 --> 03:31.384
- I'm doing it.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.485
- Atherton, stop that shit.
Come back here.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.047
-Just leave it.
-I can do this.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.324
Atherton, bring your patrol back
right now.

03:37.359 --> 03:38.754
-I'm cutting, sir.
-Shit.

03:43.332 --> 03:44.958
And they said
it couldn't be done, eh?

03:44.993 --> 03:46.696
-We good?
-Couldn't be done.

03:46.731 --> 03:48.632
MAN #-

03:51.934 --> 03:53.736
- It's an ambush. Fall back.

03:54.673 --> 03:55.804
Fall back!

03:57.775 --> 03:59.313
Weapons hot. Fire.

04:06.047 --> 04:07.321
Fuck!

04:12.658 --> 04:14.020
Get out of there.

04:14.990 --> 04:17.727
- Jake, get out of there!

04:25.473 --> 04:27.066
Come on, now.

04:44.657 --> 04:46.492
- Colonel!

05:03.071 --> 05:04.411
Let's get the fuck out of here.

05:04.446 --> 05:06.072
Get down.

05:10.518 --> 05:14.685
We got to get the fuck
out of here, huh?

05:48.919 --> 05:50.820
- Hey, Jake.

06:33.161 --> 06:34.831
How you doing, pretty lady?

06:34.866 --> 06:36.569
Don't you "pretty lady" me.

06:36.604 --> 06:39.869
My ass just walked four blocks
in this heat to get here.

06:39.904 --> 06:41.167
I hope my car is ready.

06:41.202 --> 06:43.609
-Your car?
-Yeah.<i> ¿Dónde está?</i>

06:43.644 --> 06:45.875
-Oh, your -- Oh, oh.

06:45.910 --> 06:47.910

06:47.945 --> 06:51.518
-Hey, Jake!
-- <i> Tú eres demasiado.</i>

06:51.553 --> 06:53.245
I'm sure he's done.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.049
Go in and see Jake.
He'll take care.

06:55.084 --> 06:56.886
Hm.

07:07.866 --> 07:09.635
I have to drop the fuel tank,

07:09.670 --> 07:11.538
replace the entire
fuel assembly.

07:11.573 --> 07:12.968
It's gonna take me
at least two, three hours.

07:13.003 --> 07:15.135
There's -- There's three cars
ahead of her.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.906
I'm moving as fast as I can,
man.

07:16.941 --> 07:18.710
Oh, Jesus.

07:18.745 --> 07:21.273
You know what?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.143
If the poor lady had any coin,

07:23.178 --> 07:25.684
I'm sure she'd buy herself
a new car.

07:25.719 --> 07:27.554
-Yeah, we all would.
-- What I want you to do,

07:27.589 --> 07:29.820
I want you to take
that beige Volvo

07:29.855 --> 07:32.757
we got in the back over there.

07:32.792 --> 07:36.794
I want you to slap
some new tires on it

07:36.829 --> 07:38.565
and tell her it's a gift.

07:38.600 --> 07:41.667
Hey, you promised that
Volvo to my son.

07:41.702 --> 07:43.867
And he's gonna get it.

07:43.902 --> 07:46.265
Listen, I'll tell you what,

07:46.300 --> 07:50.808
I'll have her car ready
in 20 minutes just for you.

07:50.843 --> 07:52.612
Good.

08:06.254 --> 08:09.057
Hey, Dad.

08:10.797 --> 08:12.698
How you doing, dude?

08:12.733 --> 08:14.535
-Nice to see you.
-Hello.

08:15.868 --> 08:18.968
Let's go see
that beautiful mom of yours.

08:19.003 --> 08:21.234
Got Weston the Wooly Mammoth!

08:21.269 --> 08:23.269
Body slam!

08:23.304 --> 08:25.271
-West.
-- Suplex.

08:25.306 --> 08:27.075
Oh, is Dad picking on you?

08:27.110 --> 08:30.243
This little shit's been mugging
the streets, haven't you?

08:30.278 --> 08:32.850
Hey.

08:32.885 --> 08:34.082
Hope you guys are hungry.

08:34.117 --> 08:35.589
-Starving.
-- I'm starving.

08:35.624 --> 08:37.052
-- Jinx. Double jinx.
-Jinx. Double jinx.

08:37.087 --> 08:39.857
-I think got you.

08:39.892 --> 08:41.694
-Go get washed up for dinner.
-Don't play with your daddy.

08:41.729 --> 08:44.994
Hey, hey, hey.
Where's my love?

08:46.701 --> 08:49.130
Wasn't so painful, was it?

08:49.165 --> 08:52.738
I see he's picking favorites.

08:52.773 --> 08:55.367
Day good?

08:55.402 --> 08:57.072
Long.

08:58.812 --> 09:00.746
Those came today.

09:05.654 --> 09:09.381
Shit.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.317
We're really behind, babe.

09:11.352 --> 09:13.792
-Yeah.
-What are we gonna do?

09:13.827 --> 09:16.025
I don't get another check
until Friday.

09:16.060 --> 09:19.094
Nothing lasts forever, baby.
We'll get through this.

09:19.129 --> 09:20.359
These will if we don't
pay them off.

09:20.394 --> 09:21.767
How are we gonna pay them?

09:21.802 --> 09:23.263
We're not asking
your uncle again.

09:23.298 --> 09:27.135
Well, Earl isn't exactly
in a lending mood right now.

09:27.170 --> 09:29.005
What?

09:29.040 --> 09:31.271
Nothing.

09:35.079 --> 09:36.848
Hey.

09:41.382 --> 09:46.220
We'll push through this, okay?

09:46.255 --> 09:48.959
Like we always do.

09:48.994 --> 09:50.829
This is making me really scared.

09:50.864 --> 09:52.897
There's nothing
to be scared about.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.868
Except me taking a piece
of this chicken.

09:56.903 --> 09:59.739
-No, no, no.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.374
-Dad.
-Mm-hmm?

10:08.409 --> 10:11.113
Who were the other guys
with you again?

10:13.722 --> 10:16.723
We got -- There's Evan,

10:16.758 --> 10:20.089
Pete, and Will.

10:20.124 --> 10:23.059
And you know that ugly feller
on the end, right?

10:23.094 --> 10:25.358
Mm-hmm. Colonel Mason.

10:25.393 --> 10:26.425
- Mason.

10:26.460 --> 10:28.999
Saved your life.

10:29.034 --> 10:30.737
Yeah.

10:30.772 --> 10:34.037
So I could give you your life.

10:34.072 --> 10:37.172
Do you still talk to him?

10:37.207 --> 10:40.241
Not as much as I'd like to.

10:40.276 --> 10:44.850
Hey, did you know Mason
was actually at the hospital

10:44.885 --> 10:48.953
the day you were born
all those years ago?

10:48.988 --> 10:50.152
Is that crazy?

10:52.420 --> 10:55.091
You're getting tired.

10:55.126 --> 10:56.488
It's rack time, soldier.

10:56.523 --> 10:58.930
Alright?

10:58.965 --> 11:00.426
-Dad?
-Yeah.

11:00.461 --> 11:03.737
Did you ever kill anybody?

11:03.772 --> 11:05.937
That's a heavy question.

11:05.972 --> 11:07.268
And it's a school night.

11:07.303 --> 11:09.138
Let's get you to bed, baby.

11:09.173 --> 11:11.745
Come here.

11:11.780 --> 11:13.747
Dream big, little man.

11:15.476 --> 11:17.982
-Good night, Dad.
-Good night, son.

11:55.021 --> 11:56.856
Earl!

12:01.390 --> 12:03.357
Can I help you gentlemen?

12:06.131 --> 12:07.394
What seems to be
the problem, gentlemen?

12:07.429 --> 12:09.264
Well, you know what
the problem is?

12:09.299 --> 12:12.102
You need to tell your grandpa

12:12.137 --> 12:14.269
that he needs to get with
the fucking program.

12:14.304 --> 12:16.337
Okay. And what's --
what's the --

12:16.372 --> 12:18.042
<i>¿Dónde está mi dinero?</i>

12:18.077 --> 12:20.242
Every month, this much.

12:20.277 --> 12:21.342
You must have come
to the wrong place,

12:21.377 --> 12:22.948
'cause we got no money.

12:22.983 --> 12:25.049
Well, then I'm gonna
take something.

12:25.084 --> 12:27.018
Any suggestions?

12:27.053 --> 12:29.482
Just keep walking, man.

12:29.517 --> 12:31.451
Hey, don't turn
your fucking back on me.

12:33.224 --> 12:34.795
Get you, white boy.

12:39.428 --> 12:42.165
Oh, you're fast.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.937
My bullet's faster.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.841
Round 1.

12:47.876 --> 12:49.205
Round 2.

12:49.240 --> 12:50.844
I'mma see you soon.

12:50.879 --> 12:53.044
Let's go. Get the fuck up.
Come on.<i> Vamos.</i>

12:59.547 --> 13:02.020
Fucked up my knee, man.

13:02.055 --> 13:03.857
- Earl!

13:03.892 --> 13:06.992
Look, I don't know
what that was all about.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.928
Remember what you told me

13:08.963 --> 13:12.327
first time I broke my wrist?

13:12.362 --> 13:14.428
Got my fucking ass handed to me.

13:14.463 --> 13:17.299
Remember what you said?

13:17.334 --> 13:19.136
That you learn more
from your beat downs

13:19.171 --> 13:20.500
than you do from your wins.

13:20.535 --> 13:21.974
Let me do this. Let me --
Let me give you --

13:22.009 --> 13:25.241
Let me give it to you straight,
alright?

13:25.276 --> 13:27.342
I ain't got no beef
with the gang bangers.

13:27.377 --> 13:30.444
I mean, you know,
they're doing what they do.

13:30.479 --> 13:32.644
I mean, it's part
of their culture in a way.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.383
I have a family to protect, man.

13:35.418 --> 13:37.990
I have you to protect.

13:38.025 --> 13:40.322
And that's a war
that's never gonna end.

13:43.525 --> 13:48.495
You know, I had another life
before the shop here.

13:51.170 --> 13:56.569
A life that I was fortunate
enough to walk away from.

13:56.604 --> 13:58.373
I used to be in the...

14:00.608 --> 14:02.311
...in the money business.

14:02.346 --> 14:03.477
Other people's.

14:08.220 --> 14:11.254
That's how I got the money
to put this together.

14:13.962 --> 14:18.030
I got a second chance
and the business started

14:18.065 --> 14:21.429
and I grew to really
find something

14:21.464 --> 14:23.398
that I never had
in my whole life.

14:23.433 --> 14:26.170
-A home.
-A home?

14:26.205 --> 14:28.040
And I love the people
in this neighborhood.

14:28.075 --> 14:30.174
I mean, ain't nobody got shit,
you know?

14:30.209 --> 14:33.243
Nobody -- Ain't no
rich people around here.

14:33.278 --> 14:35.476
You know, everybody's the same.

14:35.511 --> 14:36.609
I mean, I know everybody.

14:36.644 --> 14:38.182
I know everybody
who grew up here.

14:38.217 --> 14:42.219
I know kids who grew up here
who got kids.

14:42.254 --> 14:44.155
I mean, I know --
I know everybody

14:44.190 --> 14:45.519
who's died on this block.

14:45.554 --> 14:48.225
Hey, man, this is my house, too.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.491
There's no place that makes me
feel more comfortable

14:50.526 --> 14:52.361
than right here.

14:52.396 --> 14:56.464
Fuckin' dust
underneath the nails,

14:56.499 --> 15:02.239
you shouting in my fucking ear
24/7.

15:02.274 --> 15:03.977
Home. Yeah.

15:06.740 --> 15:11.413
Listen, I know these guys
that are banging, you know,

15:11.448 --> 15:14.086
they don't want to do the shit
jobs that are out there,

15:14.121 --> 15:16.484
you know, for no money at all,
breaking their ass.

15:16.519 --> 15:20.257
I mean, I wouldn't want to
do it, but I did it, you know?

15:20.292 --> 15:22.226
I know, man.
I just worry about you.

15:22.261 --> 15:25.658
'Cause they will be back.
They will be back.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.363
Let them go to
fucking Beverly Hills

15:27.398 --> 15:30.102
and shake those motherfuckers
down, you know?

15:34.042 --> 15:35.976
But not on this block.

15:39.311 --> 15:42.609
This fucking block is my home.

15:42.644 --> 15:45.249
This is my house.

15:45.284 --> 15:47.416
And ain't nobody gonna come in

15:47.451 --> 15:51.222
and shake me or anybody else
down on this block.

15:54.623 --> 15:56.128
It's just a war

15:56.163 --> 15:59.362
that's never gonna end,
plain and simple.

16:01.267 --> 16:03.762
I've learned a little something
too.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.236
Gonna get to work.

16:11.442 --> 16:12.738
How is he?

16:12.773 --> 16:16.346
Well, they threatened him.

16:16.381 --> 16:18.678
But you know
how hardheaded he is.

16:18.713 --> 16:21.087
Can't tell him fucking anything.

16:21.122 --> 16:23.320
Am I on speaker, baby?

16:23.355 --> 16:25.256
-Yeah.
-- Is West there?

16:25.291 --> 16:28.292
-Yeah.
-- Put him on.

16:28.327 --> 16:30.492
-Hey, West.
-Hi, Dad.

16:30.527 --> 16:34.199
Hey, Weston.
How's it going, buddy?

16:34.234 --> 16:36.729
Listen, Uncle Earl, man,
he's gonna be just fine.

16:36.764 --> 16:39.798
He's gonna bounce back
like he always does.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.141
I'll see you tonight
for some ice cream, alright?

16:42.176 --> 16:44.341
-Okay, Dad.
-- Man, I love you.

16:47.544 --> 16:49.346
Look, I'm glad. I am.

16:49.381 --> 16:52.712
But you know as well as I do
why I'm worried right now.

16:52.747 --> 16:55.715
Ash, he needed my help.

16:55.750 --> 16:58.619
I wasn't gonna just
stand there and do nothing.

16:58.654 --> 17:01.127
You could have called the cops.

17:03.362 --> 17:05.428
Yeah. Yeah.

17:05.463 --> 17:07.331
Listen, I got to get back
to work, baby.

17:07.366 --> 17:08.860
I'll see you tonight, alright?

17:08.895 --> 17:10.631
Alright.

17:10.666 --> 17:11.863
I love you.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.502
Yeah, I love you too.

17:13.537 --> 17:16.208
I'll bring home some dessert.
Alright.

17:33.920 --> 17:37.559
<i>Hola,</i> vigo.

17:37.594 --> 17:40.166
Hey, payback's a bitch.

17:40.201 --> 17:41.827
Have a nice day.

17:45.569 --> 17:48.141
Ash!

17:49.573 --> 17:51.309
West!

17:51.344 --> 17:53.509
Ash!

19:14.394 --> 19:16.361
I understand
you're going through

19:16.396 --> 19:18.231
a very traumatic time right now.

19:18.266 --> 19:21.729
And I totally understand
what's happening.

19:21.764 --> 19:23.467
If there's anything
you can tell us

19:23.502 --> 19:25.733
to help track this guy down,
I'd appreciate it.

19:25.768 --> 19:28.703
Do you know
why he would do this?

19:28.738 --> 19:33.246
Do you know who he is?
Have you seen him before?

19:33.281 --> 19:34.874
Look, we're gonna --
we're gonna do every--

19:34.909 --> 19:37.679
Hey, Mr. Atherton.

19:37.714 --> 19:39.417
-Jake!

19:39.452 --> 19:43.520
Jake!
Where's he going?

19:43.555 --> 19:44.884
Where's he going?

19:44.919 --> 19:46.391
Hey, what --
what are you drinking?

19:46.426 --> 19:48.294
Decaf? Get on him.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.560
This is a crime scene.
He just can't leave.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.431
You just stand there too?

19:53.466 --> 19:55.268
Go, let's go, go.

19:55.699 --> 19:58.271
What the fuck?

20:24.860 --> 20:26.761

Yo. Look, look, I didn't mean
to kill your wife.

22:19.711 --> 22:21.513
I didn't want to hurt your boy.

22:21.548 --> 22:23.944
I had to.
You don't understand, man.

22:23.979 --> 22:25.517
I fucking had to.

22:27.455 --> 22:29.620
Oh, shit, man.

22:32.119 --> 22:35.560
Go ahead, man. Do me. Fuck you.

24:17.092 --> 24:18.861
- 5 minutes.

24:29.269 --> 24:31.038
How you doing, Jake?

24:35.143 --> 24:37.748
They treating you well in here?

24:37.783 --> 24:40.113
All things considered?
You got everything you need?

24:40.148 --> 24:41.785
Is there anything you need?

24:41.820 --> 24:43.523
Living the life.

24:45.219 --> 24:47.659
Right.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.694
Well, look, um, I'm trying
to find an attorney

24:49.729 --> 24:51.630
to reopen your case.

24:51.665 --> 24:52.763
I'm working on that.

24:52.798 --> 24:54.292
Yeah, don't bother.

24:54.327 --> 24:56.096
I'm where I belong.

25:01.609 --> 25:03.037
- Okay.

25:03.072 --> 25:05.710
I'm really sorry for what
they did to your family.

25:08.143 --> 25:10.011
I wish I could tell you
the pain goes away.

25:10.046 --> 25:11.342
Well, it doesn't.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.212
But it gets better with time,
Jake.

25:13.247 --> 25:15.247
You can't see that now,
but you will.

25:15.282 --> 25:18.151
Eventually.

25:18.186 --> 25:21.253
What do you want me to say?

25:21.288 --> 25:23.794
Well, you can say anything
you want, Jake.

25:23.829 --> 25:25.862
Anything.

25:25.897 --> 25:28.601
Well, I'll tell you
what I told the judge.

25:30.836 --> 25:34.772
That the two people
I love most are gone.

25:34.807 --> 25:38.270
Dead. Butchered.

25:38.305 --> 25:39.942
'Cause of some sack of shit

25:39.977 --> 25:42.681
who should have already been
behind these walls.

25:45.180 --> 25:47.785
But I got my revenge,

25:47.820 --> 25:51.052
and I have zero remorse.

25:51.087 --> 25:53.956
'Cause I'd do it again
in a fucking heartbeat.

25:53.991 --> 25:58.895
No man should have to go through
what you've been through, Jake.

25:58.930 --> 26:00.358
Then do me a favor.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.833
Don't come back.

26:02.868 --> 26:05.770
Let sleeping dogs lie.

26:05.805 --> 26:07.640
Guard.

26:13.747 --> 26:15.813
- This way.

26:37.397 --> 26:39.199
- Friggin' year, I think.

26:39.234 --> 26:41.432
- The same.

26:41.467 --> 26:44.072
I owe you my life, sir.

26:44.107 --> 26:46.437
You don't owe me anything, Jake.

26:46.472 --> 26:48.274
Forget about that.

26:51.345 --> 26:54.346
It's part of the past, and
we're not going that way now.

26:54.381 --> 26:55.985
You, of all people, retiring,

26:56.020 --> 26:58.691
you just don't seem like
the rocking chair type.

26:58.726 --> 27:00.121
Well, we'll see how it goes.

27:00.156 --> 27:01.760
Maybe I'll be surprised

27:01.795 --> 27:05.764
at what kind of back swing
a one-legged golfer has.

27:05.799 --> 27:08.800
-Yeah, maybe.
-Yeah.

27:08.835 --> 27:10.230
Look, you're a great soldier,
Jake.

27:10.265 --> 27:12.067
One of the best I've ever known.

27:12.102 --> 27:13.464
Don't forget that.

27:13.499 --> 27:15.202
Thank you.

27:15.237 --> 27:16.742
But right now, I just
want to put that guy to bed.

27:16.777 --> 27:20.108
Go see the wife and kid.

27:20.143 --> 27:21.241
I get it.

27:21.276 --> 27:23.914
Alright.

27:23.949 --> 27:25.047
Take care of yourself.

27:25.082 --> 27:26.279
You too, sir.

27:26.314 --> 27:28.886
-Come see me some time.
-I will.

27:28.921 --> 27:30.855
- Alright.
Let's go, guys.

27:38.491 --> 27:41.228
- Atherton,
you got another visitor.

27:50.206 --> 27:52.008
Cuffs off, please.

27:57.246 --> 28:00.082
Thanks, Ed.

28:00.117 --> 28:02.821
You and Nancy
enjoy the game this weekend.

28:09.390 --> 28:12.160
Why so glum?

28:12.195 --> 28:14.294
Oh, is it that
whole prison thing?

28:14.329 --> 28:19.200
Yeah, that -- that could really
get to just about anybody.

28:19.235 --> 28:21.873
You don't belong in here.

28:21.908 --> 28:23.435
You know it. I know it.

28:23.470 --> 28:25.272
You know that, huh?

28:25.307 --> 28:27.340
And who are you?

28:27.375 --> 28:31.916
I'm the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

28:31.951 --> 28:34.985
You can call me Ramsey.

28:35.020 --> 28:37.053
It's like this.

28:37.088 --> 28:39.220
I run a small,
private task force --

28:39.255 --> 28:41.024
Listen, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

28:41.059 --> 28:43.455
I don't give two shits
what you want.

28:43.490 --> 28:45.963
I had my dose of dickheads
for the day.

28:45.998 --> 28:48.229
-Mr. Atherton --
-Guard.

28:48.264 --> 28:50.935
Take me back to my cell.

29:24.531 --> 29:26.201
- Get up.

29:47.125 --> 29:49.257
- Hello again,
Mr. Atherton.

29:49.292 --> 29:50.588
How's your head?

29:52.130 --> 29:53.327
Stay hydrated.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.362
I highly suggest you take it.

29:55.397 --> 29:59.465
You're gonna feel
very much not yourself.

30:03.537 --> 30:05.141
You CIA?

30:05.176 --> 30:08.276
No, we don't publicize ourselves
the way they do.

30:08.311 --> 30:10.982
I'll spare you the details,
but let's just say there aren't

30:11.017 --> 30:14.183
a whole lot of people
that know about our existence.

30:14.218 --> 30:16.086
Naturally.

30:16.121 --> 30:17.989
You see, Mr. Atherton,

30:18.024 --> 30:21.894
I've been watching you
for a long time now.

30:21.929 --> 30:24.358
Studied your case very closely.

30:24.393 --> 30:28.395
Special Forces,
honorably discharged.

30:31.466 --> 30:34.137
You brought home a little case
of stress disorder,

30:34.172 --> 30:39.274
but nothing that 20 milligrams
of venlafexine couldn't fix.

30:39.309 --> 30:41.276
Turned into
quite the family man.

30:41.311 --> 30:44.609
But then one day,
a couple of dirtbags came in

30:44.644 --> 30:46.116
and murdered both of them,

30:46.151 --> 30:47.546
turned your whole world
upside-down.

30:47.581 --> 30:49.647
And so you took them both out
single-handedly.

30:49.682 --> 30:51.484
Very impressive, by the way.

30:51.519 --> 30:53.552
Courts didn't see it that way.

30:53.587 --> 30:55.928
-The courts are an institution.
-Social construct.

30:55.963 --> 30:59.129
Like this prison you're in now.

30:59.164 --> 31:02.968
We don't play by
the same rules they do.

31:03.003 --> 31:05.531
No one can blame you
for doing what you did.

31:05.566 --> 31:07.137
A temporary lapse in judgment

31:07.172 --> 31:10.305
brought on by
severe traumatic stress.

31:10.340 --> 31:12.307
And I'm spending
the rest of my life in prison

31:12.342 --> 31:13.506
because of it.

31:13.541 --> 31:15.244
Do you really buy that?

31:15.279 --> 31:17.213
You think killing
a guy like Fresh

31:17.248 --> 31:19.479
means you got to spend the rest
of your life behind bars,

31:19.514 --> 31:21.184
caged up like an animal
looking over your shoulder

31:21.219 --> 31:22.614
every time
you've got to take a piss?

31:22.649 --> 31:24.649
The true tragedy

31:24.684 --> 31:26.684
is that they ever even put you
in that cage

31:26.719 --> 31:29.258
instead of giving you
a goddamn shiny medal.

31:35.233 --> 31:36.562
I can see you're still grieving.

31:36.597 --> 31:38.432
I totally understand.

31:42.141 --> 31:43.602
It doesn't mean
your life is over.

31:43.637 --> 31:47.111
You can still have a purpose.

31:50.446 --> 31:53.018
You can live your life again.

31:53.053 --> 31:55.086
I can give you that.

31:57.783 --> 31:59.585
Look at it this way.

32:03.228 --> 32:06.130
If your son Weston
were still here

32:06.165 --> 32:08.000
and he were standing here
in front of you now,

32:08.035 --> 32:10.662
what would he want you to do?

32:10.697 --> 32:12.631
Live your life like a convict?

32:14.602 --> 32:16.470
Or like the hero
he knew you were?

32:30.618 --> 32:32.486
- You want to tell me
where we're at?

32:32.521 --> 32:33.652
- Section Eight.

32:33.687 --> 32:35.291
Home away from home.

32:35.326 --> 32:37.623
- Mm. Let's hope not.

32:37.658 --> 32:40.659
- I'm sure you'll find
a way to make yourself useful.

33:12.693 --> 33:14.759
How was your flight,
Mr. Atherton?

33:14.794 --> 33:16.365
I'm here.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.335
Forgive my formal attire,
but I'm going out later.

33:19.370 --> 33:20.699
And I wanted to meet you here

33:20.734 --> 33:23.504
to show you the place
that nobody talks about.

33:23.539 --> 33:26.441
I know you remember Elias,
Ajax, and Brunner,

33:26.476 --> 33:29.081
but I see
you've met Mueller now, too.

33:29.116 --> 33:31.149
Yeah. So what is this place?

33:31.184 --> 33:33.778
This is the Batcave,
Mr. Atherton.

33:33.813 --> 33:36.517
Welcome to Section Eight.

33:36.552 --> 33:38.321
How you doing?

33:41.656 --> 33:44.393
You've heard of secret
government agencies, right?

33:44.428 --> 33:45.559
Mm-hmm.

33:45.594 --> 33:47.363
This is it.

33:47.398 --> 33:48.760
It's us.

33:48.795 --> 33:50.531
16 operatives at all times,

33:50.566 --> 33:53.501
eight here in Washington,
eight elsewhere in the world.

33:53.536 --> 33:57.439
We take our orders from the
State Department and the NSA.

33:57.474 --> 33:59.870
Most of the agents we recruit
are men and women like you

33:59.905 --> 34:02.312
who have a special set of skills

34:02.347 --> 34:06.514
but may have been deemed
a danger for whatever reason.

34:06.549 --> 34:08.186
Basically,
no one's gonna miss us

34:08.221 --> 34:10.155
if we just happen
to disappear, right?

34:10.190 --> 34:12.256
- We've been sanctioned
to eliminate any threats

34:12.291 --> 34:13.587
anywhere in the world.

34:13.622 --> 34:15.457
We deflect and contain
certain situations

34:15.492 --> 34:18.493
that present a threat
to our national security.

34:18.528 --> 34:20.132
Okay.

34:20.167 --> 34:22.497
Ms. Mueller here will be
what we call your watcher.

34:22.532 --> 34:24.598
She's accessible to you
24 hours a day

34:24.633 --> 34:26.369
and will accompany you
on any and all assignments

34:26.404 --> 34:28.668
as you gain seniority.

34:28.703 --> 34:31.308
Seniority?

34:31.343 --> 34:33.871
Trust, Mr. Atherton.

34:33.906 --> 34:35.378
You'll be given a bank account,

34:35.413 --> 34:36.907
an apartment in the city,
a vehicle.

34:36.942 --> 34:38.381
We'll provide you
with a backstory

34:38.416 --> 34:39.778
and an alias
for the outside world.

34:39.813 --> 34:41.846
But for all intents
and purposes...

34:41.881 --> 34:44.420
You're already dead.

34:44.455 --> 34:45.454
What about them?

34:45.489 --> 34:47.192
Intelligence operatives.

34:47.227 --> 34:48.589
All of our equipment,
top of the line,

34:48.624 --> 34:50.690
military prototypes.

34:50.725 --> 34:53.198
Now, I wish I had more time
and could show you around,

34:53.233 --> 34:54.529
give you the whole tour,

34:54.564 --> 34:57.400
but I'm afraid
my engagement is pressing.

34:57.435 --> 35:00.304
Make sure that he gets geared up
so he can get right to work.

35:00.339 --> 35:02.636
But first, my team here

35:02.671 --> 35:07.344
will be putting you through
the initiation process.

35:07.379 --> 35:09.841
It's a dead man's party.

35:09.876 --> 35:11.810
-Dead man.
-Let's go. Let's do it.

35:11.845 --> 35:13.812
Come on,
let's get you settled in.

35:13.847 --> 35:16.320
-Can't wait.
-Let's go.

35:16.355 --> 35:18.487
- Let me show you
a little something, hm?

35:18.522 --> 35:21.886
Right there.

35:21.921 --> 35:24.196
Come on.

35:24.231 --> 35:27.760
You think the world is gonna
wait for you to decide to fight?

35:27.795 --> 35:29.729
I'm not gonna fight you.

35:29.764 --> 35:31.632
-This is the big leagues.
-Listen to me.

35:31.667 --> 35:33.700
You're gonna fight!

35:33.735 --> 35:36.307
Fuck you. Fuck off.

35:37.574 --> 35:39.277
- Fuck that little bitch.

35:42.282 --> 35:43.809
Clean him up, Ajax.

35:48.651 --> 35:49.947
-Little bitch.
-Come on.

35:49.982 --> 35:51.751
-You're a tough guy.
-You ready for this?

36:00.828 --> 36:02.267
Are you happy?

36:09.606 --> 36:11.342
Get him, Ajax.

36:13.478 --> 36:14.906
Show him who's boss.

36:20.881 --> 36:22.320
- Jake.

36:27.459 --> 36:28.590
- Dad?

36:34.334 --> 36:35.894
I'll see myself out.

36:38.866 --> 36:41.471
Fucking...

36:41.506 --> 36:43.638
Come here. Help me the fuck up.

36:47.710 --> 36:50.282
That's fear.

36:50.317 --> 36:51.844
He doesn't belong here, guys.

36:51.879 --> 36:54.418
None of us belonged
when we first got here.

36:54.453 --> 36:56.915
Plus, he wasn't that afraid
when he got started with you.

36:56.950 --> 36:58.950
I see the way you look
at him, little girl.

36:58.985 --> 37:00.985
I didn't look at him any way,

37:01.020 --> 37:04.021
so don't start pointing fingers
at me when he kicked your ass.

37:04.056 --> 37:06.760
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Mnh-mnh. Mnh-mnh.

37:06.795 --> 37:09.862
No. No, fuck that.

37:09.897 --> 37:12.337
No, fuck that shit.

37:30.489 --> 37:32.753
- Your target is
Alejandro Castillo.

37:32.788 --> 37:34.788
He's a defense contractor,

37:34.823 --> 37:36.691
made his wealth
by selling our weapons

37:36.726 --> 37:38.858
to the highest bidder
in the black market.

37:38.893 --> 37:41.762
He recently came across
some schematics

37:41.797 --> 37:44.666
the DOJ desperately
wants recovered.

37:44.701 --> 37:47.031
They believe it's his intention
to share these schematics

37:47.066 --> 37:49.099
with one of his Russian friends.

37:49.134 --> 37:51.475
Yeah, Russia.

37:51.510 --> 37:53.543
Fan-fucking-tastic.

37:53.578 --> 37:55.512
The deal's going down in Mexico,

37:55.547 --> 37:58.977
and he will have several
of his armed guards at hand,

37:59.012 --> 38:01.485
as he almost always does.

38:01.520 --> 38:04.686
So it'll be hard to get to him.

38:04.721 --> 38:07.788
When or if we get
the schematics in hand,

38:07.823 --> 38:10.054
what are we supposed
to do with Castillo?

38:10.089 --> 38:12.661
All POIs are to be eliminated.

38:15.435 --> 38:18.370
Ramsey left that out
of the job description.

38:18.405 --> 38:19.998
So we're assassins, huh?

38:22.475 --> 38:24.607
We're whatever
we're ordered to be.

38:51.438 --> 38:52.536
- What do you see?

38:52.571 --> 38:53.735
- 9, maybe 10 guards.

38:53.770 --> 38:55.671
Shit.

38:55.706 --> 38:57.838
Go. You've got to get Castillo.

38:57.873 --> 38:59.741
Are you not coming?

38:59.776 --> 39:02.073
That's why you got your
get-out-of-jail-free card, Jake,

39:02.108 --> 39:04.009
not me.

39:04.044 --> 39:06.517
Your freedom lies on
the success of this mission.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.420
How could I forget?

39:19.928 --> 39:22.467
Ah,<i> Papi</i> will be right back.

39:22.502 --> 39:24.832
-Don't go anywhere, guys.
-Don't take too long.

39:24.867 --> 39:27.571
Mwah!

39:27.606 --> 39:28.737
Johnny!

39:28.772 --> 39:30.772
Come here.
Come, come.

39:30.807 --> 39:33.071
Ahh.

39:33.106 --> 39:35.172
Castillo.

39:35.207 --> 39:38.142
They say you really know
how to impress your guests.

39:38.177 --> 39:41.552
Hello.
Look around, my friend.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.752
Huh?

39:43.787 --> 39:47.217
You know, people take one look
at this place

39:47.252 --> 39:49.692
and you know
what they all think about?

39:49.727 --> 39:53.960
They think about
the old, the filthy,

39:53.995 --> 39:56.798
buried dreams.

39:56.833 --> 39:59.900
You know what I think about,
Johnny?

39:59.935 --> 40:03.035
I think about opportunity.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.037
I think about a chance
for the new.

40:05.072 --> 40:08.040
I think about the future.

40:08.075 --> 40:09.976
You know what I think?

40:13.949 --> 40:16.521
This...

40:16.556 --> 40:18.589
This is a fucking landfill.

40:25.697 --> 40:28.929
-Cut the shit.
-Don't worry, Johnny.

40:28.964 --> 40:30.865
Cut the fucking shit, Castillo.

40:30.900 --> 40:35.166
Give me what I came here for.

40:35.201 --> 40:37.003
Are you threatening me?

40:45.783 --> 40:48.146
What is this, Castillo?
Is this a setup?

40:48.181 --> 40:50.247
-Everybody calm down. Calm down.
-Are you fucking with me?

40:50.282 --> 40:51.721
-Castillo, you piece of shit.
-Drop it.

41:20.752 --> 41:22.246
Fuck this shit!

41:22.281 --> 41:24.149
Shoot that motherfucker!

41:26.285 --> 41:27.790
Move your ass, Jake.

41:27.825 --> 41:29.990
We've got to get Castillo
before they do.

41:30.025 --> 41:31.629
- On it. Cover me.

41:41.366 --> 41:43.036
Over there behind the car.

42:20.306 --> 42:22.614
You must be the buyer.

42:24.244 --> 42:25.749
Who the fuck are you?

42:25.784 --> 42:27.377
You must be the seller.

42:27.412 --> 42:29.885
Seller of what? What the fuck
are you talking about?

42:29.920 --> 42:32.756
- I'm gonna ask you once --
The schematics.

42:32.791 --> 42:34.318
Where are they?

42:34.353 --> 42:35.957
Oh, man.

42:35.992 --> 42:37.860
You too?

42:37.895 --> 42:39.961
Fuck you.

42:58.014 --> 43:02.786
What exactly about "eliminate
all" did you not understand?

43:02.821 --> 43:04.920
They were innocent people,
Ramsey.

43:04.955 --> 43:06.251
Nobody's innocent.

43:06.286 --> 43:08.187
- Those girls were.

43:08.222 --> 43:11.828
You got what you asked for,
right?

43:11.863 --> 43:14.160
You compromised the integrity
of this mission

43:14.195 --> 43:17.229
along with your own life
and Mueller's.

43:17.264 --> 43:21.134
We're here. The job is done.
What more do you need to know?

43:21.169 --> 43:23.708
I want the man I recruited
into this agency, Atherton.

43:23.743 --> 43:26.370
So you want someone to basically
just disregard all human life

43:26.405 --> 43:29.208
for you and this little
fucking club of yours, huh?

43:29.243 --> 43:31.111
Is that what you think this is?

43:31.146 --> 43:34.983
You think we're trading baseball
cards and decoder rings here?

43:35.018 --> 43:36.413
Atherton,
this is serious business.

43:36.448 --> 43:38.690
And until you understand that,

43:38.725 --> 43:41.891
maybe it's best I just throw you
back into that jail cell.

43:41.926 --> 43:43.794
You can do that.

43:43.829 --> 43:45.356
But what you're not gonna do

43:45.391 --> 43:48.062
is hold that over my head
like it's some kind of debt.

43:48.097 --> 43:49.965
You're a man of conviction.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.769
That's why you're here.

43:53.905 --> 43:56.103
Now go on, get some rest.
You earned it.

44:01.011 --> 44:02.142
What do you think?

44:02.177 --> 44:04.309
I think he did good back there.

44:04.344 --> 44:05.948
Maybe.

44:05.983 --> 44:07.279
What do you want me to do?

44:07.314 --> 44:09.413
Do your job.

44:09.448 --> 44:11.217
Just keep an eye on him.

44:15.025 --> 44:18.059
Look,

44:18.094 --> 44:20.765
your golden boy screwed up.

44:20.800 --> 44:22.767
He left witnesses, right?

44:22.802 --> 44:24.461
There was a time when
you wouldn't let this happen.

44:24.496 --> 44:27.200
What are you trying to say?

44:27.235 --> 44:29.906
We all make mistakes,

44:29.941 --> 44:32.744
including you.

44:32.779 --> 44:34.339

Colonel.

48:20.765 --> 48:22.336
Jake.

48:22.371 --> 48:24.305
How's the leg, sir?

48:24.340 --> 48:28.144
Yeah, it's -- it's great.

48:28.179 --> 48:29.475
It's really great.

48:29.510 --> 48:33.512
Couple of severed nerves,
shattered bones.

48:33.547 --> 48:35.349
I don't think
I'll be able to play golf

48:35.384 --> 48:37.219
the way I used to.

48:37.254 --> 48:39.221
Severed nerves.

48:42.292 --> 48:45.359
I'm sorry, sir.

48:45.394 --> 48:47.394
I blame myself too.

48:47.429 --> 48:51.134
But blaming yourself
is to easiest thing to do.

48:51.169 --> 48:54.170
But it's not -- not always
the right thing.

48:57.340 --> 49:01.144
Well, you saved my life, sir.

49:01.179 --> 49:03.377
My wife and kid thank you.

49:03.412 --> 49:06.215
Hey, we're just trying
to make the best

49:06.250 --> 49:08.448
out of a shit situation.

49:08.483 --> 49:10.582
Is that what it was?

49:10.617 --> 49:13.189
Hey.

49:13.224 --> 49:14.322
You're alright.

49:49.392 --> 49:52.492
That's a lot of empty bottles.

49:52.527 --> 49:54.725
They weren't empty
when I got them.

49:56.201 --> 49:58.828
Want some company?

49:58.863 --> 50:02.238
Someone's got to pay my tab.

50:02.273 --> 50:03.602
Vodka straight up.

50:03.637 --> 50:06.539
Whew, straight for
the big stuff.

50:06.574 --> 50:09.212
I get specific.

50:11.777 --> 50:14.646
Ramsey -- What's his story?

50:14.681 --> 50:16.384
Who knows?

50:16.419 --> 50:19.519
No one knows anything
about Ramsey but Ramsey.

50:19.554 --> 50:22.126
What about you?

50:22.161 --> 50:25.525
How did you get involved
with Section Eight?

50:25.560 --> 50:29.397
Let's just say I had
a background in the Army.

50:29.432 --> 50:31.201
In the Army?

50:31.236 --> 50:35.403
My commanding officer
reprimanded me.

50:35.438 --> 50:37.801
What did you do then?

50:39.475 --> 50:41.211
Knocked his teeth out.

50:41.246 --> 50:44.379
Remind me never to fuck
with you, Miss Mueller. Geez.

50:44.414 --> 50:46.348
Mm.

50:48.583 --> 50:50.484
What's wrong?

50:50.519 --> 50:52.816
It's nothing.

50:52.851 --> 50:54.752
- Mm.

50:54.787 --> 50:59.757
It's just...my wife drink--
drank vodka.

51:01.464 --> 51:03.497
I'm sorry about what happened.

51:05.732 --> 51:08.634
I'm sure it's not something
you can easily get over.

51:12.277 --> 51:15.740
I don't think
you ever get over it.

51:15.775 --> 51:17.643
This is the next piece
of the puzzle.

51:17.678 --> 51:19.414
Senator Jim Graham.

51:19.449 --> 51:23.550
He lives in a secluded estate
just outside the city.

51:23.585 --> 51:25.354
Two objectives here.

51:25.389 --> 51:27.290
One is to retrieve
digital information

51:27.325 --> 51:29.325
of a case-sensitive nature.

51:29.360 --> 51:31.888
And the other is
to eliminate the target.

51:31.923 --> 51:34.429
We're assassinating
a state senator?

51:34.464 --> 51:36.596
Well, don't let the job title
fool you.

51:36.631 --> 51:38.433
This guy's a traitor
to this country.

51:38.468 --> 51:39.764
He's paid off enough bureaucrats

51:39.799 --> 51:41.799
to keep his sorry ass
out of jail.

51:41.834 --> 51:44.736
Liza, I want you to go in,
get the files, and get out.

51:44.771 --> 51:47.343
Jake, you're on bird watch.

51:47.378 --> 51:49.741
Transpo. You'll be there
as reinforcements.

51:49.776 --> 51:51.578
What kind of security
are we looking at?

51:51.613 --> 51:53.448
Well, the senator's paranoid,

51:53.483 --> 51:54.911
but he's not stupid,
and he's rich.

51:54.946 --> 51:56.616
Private contractors,
top of the line.

51:56.651 --> 51:59.784
If they resist,
which they will,

51:59.819 --> 52:01.225
you resist back.

52:01.260 --> 52:03.227
You know what to do,
right, Atherton?

52:03.262 --> 52:04.393
-You got it, boss.
-That's right.

52:04.428 --> 52:06.659
A black bag job.
Bag and tag, kids.

52:06.694 --> 52:07.792
-Let's go.
-- Let's go.

52:07.827 --> 52:09.530
Let's go.

52:09.565 --> 52:12.302
- Thank you very much.

52:12.337 --> 52:13.897
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

52:13.932 --> 52:15.734
Too kind. Too kind.

52:15.769 --> 52:17.571
Thank you.

52:17.606 --> 52:20.607
Thank you. Thank you.

52:20.642 --> 52:21.740
Thank you.

52:21.775 --> 52:23.940
Thank you very much. Thank you.

52:23.975 --> 52:26.382
Thank you.

52:28.551 --> 52:32.652
You know, when Barbara and I
set off for Washington,

52:32.687 --> 52:35.457
it was with one promise --

52:35.492 --> 52:38.229
take back America.

52:41.630 --> 52:46.369
Take back America
from corporate greed.

52:46.404 --> 52:47.898
Alright, guys,
you got us out here

52:47.933 --> 52:49.801
in a fucking landscaping van.

52:49.836 --> 52:52.375
Let's get this shit done,
alright? Let's make it happen.

52:52.410 --> 52:54.971
- Hold your panties,
Ajax. I'm on the move.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.940
Birds have left the nest.

53:07.920 --> 53:09.854
- Security breach alert.

53:09.889 --> 53:11.658
Security breach alert.

53:11.693 --> 53:15.662
This election
will not be stolen.

53:15.697 --> 53:18.500
-Take back America.

53:18.535 --> 53:20.733
- Hostiles. Security breach.

53:25.905 --> 53:27.872
Excuse me, sir, we need to
get you out of here now.

53:27.907 --> 53:29.544
-Come with me. This way, sir.
-Please come with me.

53:29.579 --> 53:31.579
Aw, shit, they're on to us.
They're on to us.

53:31.614 --> 53:32.679
They made us. They made us.

53:32.714 --> 53:35.682
Let's go. Let's go.

53:35.717 --> 53:38.289
Liza, let's get a move on.
We got heat on us.

53:49.764 --> 53:52.028
Let's go. Let's get a move on.

53:52.063 --> 53:54.536
Get him in there. Come on.

53:54.571 --> 53:55.702
Whew.

54:05.351 --> 54:06.944
Downloading.

54:06.979 --> 54:08.583
20%.

54:15.086 --> 54:17.427
What the fuck was that?

54:19.024 --> 54:21.365
Where the fuck does this
Forrest Gump motherfucker

54:21.400 --> 54:22.465
think he's running to?

54:22.500 --> 54:23.565
We got to go.

54:30.706 --> 54:31.936
Move. We got it.

54:31.971 --> 54:34.004
Let's go. Liza, let's go.
We got some heat.

54:34.039 --> 54:35.379
Yeah. On my way to you.

55:12.814 --> 55:14.781
Ple-- Please.

55:14.816 --> 55:16.079
I have a family.

55:16.114 --> 55:17.388
I have a wife.

55:17.423 --> 55:18.521
I have a son.

55:18.556 --> 55:19.786
Please.

55:31.030 --> 55:32.766
The hell are you doing?

55:32.801 --> 55:34.438
You hesitated.

55:34.473 --> 55:37.507
We don't hesitate.

55:37.542 --> 55:39.641
It's not fucking okay.

55:57.628 --> 55:59.562
- <i> It's me.</i>

55:59.597 --> 56:01.927
<i>Listen, if you want to talk</i>
<i>about what happened, I'm here.</i>

58:11.993 --> 58:14.191
Thought I'd take you up
on that golf game, sir.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.635
Come inside, Jake.

58:25.908 --> 58:28.007
So you're a fugitive now.

58:30.044 --> 58:31.142
How can I help?

58:31.177 --> 58:33.243
Section Eight --

58:33.278 --> 58:35.916
you ever hear of them?

58:35.951 --> 58:40.690
I know the real Section Eight
was dismantled back in the '90s.

58:40.725 --> 58:42.351
What do you mean?

58:42.386 --> 58:45.926
Well, I hear the agency's
still alive.

58:45.961 --> 58:48.027
A cesspool of operatives.

58:48.062 --> 58:51.030
Disgraced CIA, FBI, you name it.

58:51.065 --> 58:53.065
Very well connected.

58:53.100 --> 58:55.166
The highest levels
in Washington.

58:57.269 --> 58:59.104
We talking the White House?

58:59.139 --> 59:01.205
As White as it's always been.

59:04.980 --> 59:07.310
You ever hear of a guy
named Ramsey?

59:07.345 --> 59:09.620
No.

59:09.655 --> 59:11.182
No, I can't say I have.

59:11.217 --> 59:13.987
I'll make some calls.

59:14.022 --> 59:17.892
But look, if Section Eight
is after you,

59:17.927 --> 59:19.960
you got some serious problems,
soldier.

59:19.995 --> 59:22.996
Yeah, I know.

59:23.031 --> 59:25.702
Look, I hate to ask, sir,
but --

59:25.737 --> 59:27.198
What?

59:27.233 --> 59:29.134
I need money and a gun.

59:31.105 --> 59:33.072
You're gonna need
more than that.

1:00:07.944 --> 1:00:10.307
Mr. Atherton,

1:00:10.342 --> 1:00:13.145
why don't you just come on in
and we can talk about it?

1:00:16.282 --> 1:00:18.051
I hear you.
Just stay calm, alright?

1:00:18.086 --> 1:00:21.021
Come on in and we'll figure
this thing out together.

1:00:23.190 --> 1:00:24.926
I'm sorry, Mr. Atherton.

1:00:24.961 --> 1:00:26.158
I was really hoping
it would work out between us.

1:00:26.193 --> 1:00:29.161
But Senator Graham,
you hesitated.

1:00:29.196 --> 1:00:34.232
I told you, in this job,
you can't hesitate.

1:00:34.267 --> 1:00:35.706
Make the call.

1:00:35.741 --> 1:00:38.137
-We are tracking him.
-That's sweet.

1:00:38.172 --> 1:00:40.337
You see, Locke isn't like
other men.

1:00:40.372 --> 1:00:44.275
He isn't burdened by weaknesses
like remorse and guilt.

1:00:44.310 --> 1:00:46.046
Ramsey, we will find Jake.

1:00:46.081 --> 1:00:47.916
Oh, I'm sure you will.

1:00:47.951 --> 1:00:50.248
It'll be interesting to see
who finds him first.

1:00:54.155 --> 1:00:56.727
Better hope he doesn't
find you first.

1:01:21.787 --> 1:01:24.788
This is Locke.

1:01:24.823 --> 1:01:27.923
- We need you.

1:01:27.958 --> 1:01:30.794
Give me a name.

1:01:30.829 --> 1:01:34.325
- Jake Atherton,
ex-military Special Forces.

1:01:34.360 --> 1:01:36.866
Ramsey thinks
he's become a problem.

1:01:41.070 --> 1:01:43.004
Where can I find him?

1:02:23.145 --> 1:02:24.914
Sorry.

1:02:27.985 --> 1:02:29.050
Landon.

1:02:29.085 --> 1:02:31.987
Mr. Atherton. You remember me.

1:02:32.022 --> 1:02:33.890
Of course I remember you, man.

1:02:33.925 --> 1:02:36.354
You were Weston's best friend.

1:02:36.389 --> 1:02:39.929
I really missed him.

1:02:39.964 --> 1:02:42.558
Yeah, man, I miss him too.

1:02:42.593 --> 1:02:44.901
- I still go by
your old house.

1:02:44.936 --> 1:02:47.497
They boarded it up
after what happened.

1:02:47.532 --> 1:02:50.874
My mom says
they're gonna tear down.

1:02:53.307 --> 1:02:55.538
Look, we're all happy here

1:02:55.573 --> 1:02:58.310
that you got Fresh
and everyone else.

1:02:58.345 --> 1:03:02.578
Wait, how --
how do you know Fresh?

1:03:02.613 --> 1:03:05.317
Saw him around the neighborhood
for a while,

1:03:05.352 --> 1:03:07.990
then at this place
by the comic book shop.

1:03:08.025 --> 1:03:11.389
He was always talking
with some people there.

1:03:11.424 --> 1:03:12.896
Alright, Landon, listen to me.

1:03:12.931 --> 1:03:14.590
Listen to me.
This is very important.

1:03:14.625 --> 1:03:17.032
Can you tell me anything about
the people he was meeting with?

1:03:17.067 --> 1:03:18.495
Who was he talking to?

1:03:18.530 --> 1:03:19.969
I don't know.

1:03:20.004 --> 1:03:21.905
They were just wearing
some black suits.

1:03:21.940 --> 1:03:23.368
Black suits?

1:03:23.403 --> 1:03:26.305
They also mostly just looked
like these people.

1:03:26.340 --> 1:03:29.011
Right here.

1:03:37.186 --> 1:03:39.087
Get down.
Stay down, stay down.

1:04:12.254 --> 1:04:13.484
Put the gun down.

1:04:13.519 --> 1:04:14.991
-Get on the ground!
-On the ground!

1:04:15.026 --> 1:04:17.125
-- Drop it!
-OFFICER #- Freeze!

1:04:17.160 --> 1:04:18.291
Shit.

1:05:00.104 --> 1:05:02.137
He's gone. I lost him.

1:05:02.172 --> 1:05:03.666
<i>I thought you were the best.</i>

1:05:03.701 --> 1:05:07.406
No, no, no, who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

1:05:07.441 --> 1:05:09.540
I'll find him
and I'll finish the job.

1:05:09.575 --> 1:05:12.510
Alright?
Have I ever let you down before?

1:05:12.545 --> 1:05:14.314
- <i> You just did.</i>

1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:32.299
As I get older, it gets harder
and harder to remember

1:05:32.334 --> 1:05:34.499
Mom and Dad.

1:05:34.534 --> 1:05:38.437
It's fuzzy, you know?
It's out of focus.

1:05:41.079 --> 1:05:44.344
But I remember you.

1:05:44.379 --> 1:05:46.742
You adopted me.

1:05:46.777 --> 1:05:50.449
You had the courage to raise me.

1:05:50.484 --> 1:05:54.057
You told me I was Superman,
and I fucking believed.

1:05:55.621 --> 1:06:00.063
That was the biggest honor
I've ever had in my whole life.

1:06:01.759 --> 1:06:03.528
I'd be nothing without you, man.

1:06:13.276 --> 1:06:15.474
Hey, we got company.

1:06:15.509 --> 1:06:18.048
Grab the shotgun.
Get in the back. Now.

1:06:18.083 --> 1:06:20.710
No goddamn retreat.

1:06:20.745 --> 1:06:23.086
And no fucking prisoners.

1:06:50.214 --> 1:06:54.150
-Got you, mother--

1:06:54.185 --> 1:06:56.119
Go out back. Now.

1:07:15.767 --> 1:07:17.536
Ajax, what the fuck?

1:07:17.571 --> 1:07:19.307
Move out of the way.

1:07:21.212 --> 1:07:22.310
Fuck it.

1:07:33.587 --> 1:07:35.356
You shoot like bitch.

1:07:37.789 --> 1:07:39.657
You just shot your own man.

1:07:39.692 --> 1:07:42.132
Oh, no, I'm s-- I don't care!

1:07:47.337 --> 1:07:49.205
You out?

1:07:49.240 --> 1:07:51.207
I think you're out.

1:07:54.443 --> 1:07:55.574
Out?

1:07:55.609 --> 1:07:57.873
Hold up.

1:07:57.908 --> 1:08:00.513
I'm out. Now let's fuck.

1:08:06.917 --> 1:08:11.392
Ever since I met you,
I've had this...

1:08:11.427 --> 1:08:12.492
urge.

1:08:12.527 --> 1:08:13.658
Mm-hmm. What's that?

1:08:13.693 --> 1:08:16.529
To rip your fucking flesh off.

1:08:16.564 --> 1:08:18.300
What are you waiting for?

1:08:18.335 --> 1:08:19.895
Come on.

1:08:26.706 --> 1:08:28.574
Fuck you.

1:08:40.357 --> 1:08:41.653
You're mine now.

1:08:44.295 --> 1:08:45.525
How you like me now?

1:09:09.254 --> 1:09:10.517
Earl!

1:09:12.356 --> 1:09:15.225
-You alright?

1:09:15.260 --> 1:09:17.293
Come on, Jake.
We got to get out of here.

1:09:17.328 --> 1:09:18.987
Jake, I think you better
get your ass out of here.

1:09:19.022 --> 1:09:20.923
I don't think they're all dead.

1:09:20.958 --> 1:09:22.562
- Jake.

1:09:24.533 --> 1:09:25.862
I love you.

1:09:31.837 --> 1:09:33.870
Why didn't you try
and kill me back there?

1:09:33.905 --> 1:09:36.675
Because maybe I want out of
Section Eight as much as you do.

1:09:36.710 --> 1:09:37.940
Bullshit.

1:09:37.975 --> 1:09:39.381
- Oh, come on.

1:09:39.416 --> 1:09:43.011
I just put my ass
on the line for you.

1:09:43.046 --> 1:09:47.587
I'm just having a hard time
trusting anybody right now.

1:09:47.622 --> 1:09:50.689
When Ramsey came to visit you
in jail,

1:09:50.724 --> 1:09:55.298
what do you think he would have
done if you refused, huh?

1:09:55.333 --> 1:09:57.696
It's clandestine for a reason.

1:09:57.731 --> 1:09:59.797
We can't have people
just walking on the street

1:09:59.832 --> 1:10:03.339
or in jail knowing about it.

1:10:03.374 --> 1:10:05.539
Where is Ramsey now?

1:10:05.574 --> 1:10:07.508
What? Why?

1:10:07.543 --> 1:10:09.411
Because that's
where we're going.

1:10:17.487 --> 1:10:20.290
You know this cabin pretty well?

1:10:20.325 --> 1:10:22.721
Yeah.

1:10:22.756 --> 1:10:26.791
You know, there's no coffee shop
or drive-thrus along the way.

1:10:30.962 --> 1:10:32.764
What? What's wrong?

1:10:36.473 --> 1:10:38.440
You should go back, Liza.

1:10:38.475 --> 1:10:40.442
-Please.
-What? No.

1:10:41.544 --> 1:10:43.544
You said it yourself.
This is suicide.

1:10:43.579 --> 1:10:45.546
Jake, I'm here now.

1:10:59.023 --> 1:11:02.398
- Hey, Dad.

1:11:06.030 --> 1:11:07.832
There's nothing
to be scared about.

1:11:16.381 --> 1:11:19.844
- Welcome to Montana,
Mr. Atherton.

1:11:19.879 --> 1:11:22.418
I wouldn't bother trying
to get out.

1:11:22.453 --> 1:11:24.585
If there's anything
Liza does well,

1:11:24.620 --> 1:11:26.719
it's tie men up.

1:11:26.754 --> 1:11:28.622
Sorry, Jake.

1:11:28.657 --> 1:11:30.954
I had to bring you here somehow.

1:11:30.989 --> 1:11:33.429
So the committee meeting,
you just made that up?

1:11:33.464 --> 1:11:35.090
Oh, no.
That part was actually real.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:37.092
Yeah, those little
congressional bastards

1:11:37.127 --> 1:11:38.830
should be here by nightfall,

1:11:38.865 --> 1:11:41.734
but you might be at the bottom
of the river by then.

1:11:41.769 --> 1:11:43.769
So why am I here?

1:11:43.804 --> 1:11:45.507
Why haven't you killed me yet?

1:11:45.542 --> 1:11:48.103
Well, you made it this far.

1:11:48.138 --> 1:11:51.711
And if I did that, wouldn't that
spoil the surprise?

1:11:58.852 --> 1:12:01.655
Didn't see that coming, did you?

1:12:01.690 --> 1:12:03.624
What are you doing here,
Colonel?

1:12:03.659 --> 1:12:06.154
Well, I guess I did
know a guy named Ramsey.

1:12:11.469 --> 1:12:13.029
This was you?

1:12:13.064 --> 1:12:15.130
All of this was you?

1:12:15.165 --> 1:12:17.836
We were looking for a soldier,
Atherton.

1:12:17.871 --> 1:12:20.839
One with a killer instinct,
one who could do the job.

1:12:22.942 --> 1:12:24.711
My wife.

1:12:26.913 --> 1:12:29.518
My kid, my boy. You --

1:12:29.553 --> 1:12:31.179
My fucking family.

1:12:31.214 --> 1:12:33.753
- Yeah, that one's on me.

1:12:33.788 --> 1:12:37.955
Threw some money around to
some local shit stains and...

1:12:37.990 --> 1:12:39.561
That's what happens
when you go cheap.

1:12:39.596 --> 1:12:40.892
I didn't know how
you were gonna react,

1:12:40.927 --> 1:12:43.125
but you did not disappoint.

1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.567
How could you do this
to me, sir?

1:12:45.602 --> 1:12:47.932
I gave you a second chance
at life in Afghanistan.

1:12:47.967 --> 1:12:49.164
What'd you do with it?

1:12:49.199 --> 1:12:51.870
Ended up fixing cars.

1:12:51.905 --> 1:12:53.608
You had a skill.

1:12:53.643 --> 1:12:56.479
You threw it all away.

1:12:56.514 --> 1:12:57.909
I gave it away?

1:13:00.045 --> 1:13:02.815
You knew what they meant to me.

1:13:02.850 --> 1:13:06.148
I'm sorry.
You just wouldn't listen.

1:13:06.183 --> 1:13:07.985
Now we got a decision to make.

1:13:11.892 --> 1:13:13.628
My guests should
be arriving soon,

1:13:13.663 --> 1:13:16.026
so we'll just leave you here
with your thoughts.

1:13:16.061 --> 1:13:17.896
Won't be long.

1:13:17.931 --> 1:13:19.766
But if you need anything,

1:13:19.801 --> 1:13:22.604
don't hesitate to ask.

1:13:31.945 --> 1:13:34.011
I say we take him out.

1:13:34.046 --> 1:13:36.046
He's a liability.

1:13:36.081 --> 1:13:39.687
Yeah. I agree.

1:13:39.722 --> 1:13:41.755
Could you check, count it?

1:13:41.790 --> 1:13:43.559
Let's do this.

1:13:46.630 --> 1:13:48.091
You're alright?

1:13:48.126 --> 1:13:49.697
Yeah, I'm good.

1:13:49.732 --> 1:13:51.061
Sure.

1:13:54.132 --> 1:13:55.901
-Excuse me. Be right back.
-Mm.

1:13:59.973 --> 1:14:02.743
Alright.

1:14:02.778 --> 1:14:05.482
-Looks good.
-Right on.

1:14:09.620 --> 1:14:12.148
- The fuck do you want?

1:14:15.252 --> 1:14:17.021
No.

1:14:17.056 --> 1:14:19.023
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:14:19.058 --> 1:14:20.629
-- No.
-Of course I had nothing to do

1:14:20.664 --> 1:14:21.894
with what happened
to your family, Jake.

1:14:21.929 --> 1:14:23.929
You were right.
I couldn't retire.

1:14:23.964 --> 1:14:25.964
I was contracted
to bring down Section Eight,

1:14:25.999 --> 1:14:28.703
and I agreed.

1:14:28.738 --> 1:14:31.640
Why didn't you just tell me?

1:14:31.675 --> 1:14:34.577
Because if I would have told
you, it would ruin the plan.

1:14:34.612 --> 1:14:35.908
Now, the plan has changed

1:14:35.943 --> 1:14:38.845
and we're gonna have
to end this, you and me.

1:14:41.916 --> 1:14:46.248
Then let's fucking end this.

1:14:46.283 --> 1:14:47.788
Great.

1:14:47.823 --> 1:14:50.153
Back in the chair.

1:14:50.188 --> 1:14:52.595
-You got to be kidding me.

1:14:52.630 --> 1:14:53.794
What are you
standing around for?

1:14:53.829 --> 1:14:55.730
Go check on the prisoner.

1:15:02.266 --> 1:15:03.606
The hell is going on?

1:15:03.641 --> 1:15:04.805
Psst.

1:15:55.286 --> 1:15:58.892
Mason, you fucking
double-crossed me?

1:15:58.927 --> 1:16:00.223
Alright, Atherton.
What do you want?

1:16:00.258 --> 1:16:02.324
You want money?
I got money for you.

1:16:02.359 --> 1:16:04.997
Right there on the table.

1:16:05.032 --> 1:16:07.802
There's $3 million in that case
on the table over there.

1:16:07.837 --> 1:16:10.398
You can take all that money
and go wherever you want.

1:16:10.433 --> 1:16:12.037
I'll classify you as dead.

1:16:12.072 --> 1:16:13.170
No one will come looking
for you.

1:16:13.205 --> 1:16:14.941
You're a free man.

1:16:14.976 --> 1:16:17.009
Atherton, you can be
a free, rich man.

1:16:17.044 --> 1:16:18.846
How's that sound to you, huh?

1:16:23.919 --> 1:16:26.216
Okay, well, what do you want,
Atherton?

1:16:26.251 --> 1:16:27.921
I want to watch you die.

1:16:27.956 --> 1:16:29.989
Oh, yeah.

1:16:30.024 --> 1:16:31.760
Let's talk about
your good buddy

1:16:31.795 --> 1:16:34.191
Colonel Tom there
for a second, huh?

1:16:34.226 --> 1:16:35.698
Think about it.

1:16:35.733 --> 1:16:37.964
How do you think he knew
about your family?

1:16:37.999 --> 1:16:39.229
How did I know?

1:16:39.264 --> 1:16:41.704
How did I even know about you?
Huh?

1:16:41.739 --> 1:16:43.299
He's trying to save his own ass.

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:48.271
They killed your family, Jake.

1:16:48.306 --> 1:16:49.910
What else do you want to know?

1:16:51.716 --> 1:16:54.849
Go. Come on.

1:16:54.884 --> 1:16:56.114
Watch out!

1:17:00.857 --> 1:17:02.384
No. Hang on, Colonel.

1:17:02.419 --> 1:17:04.320
I got you, just hang on.

1:17:24.045 --> 1:17:28.883
That's twice I've saved you now.

1:17:28.918 --> 1:17:32.920
Jake...

1:17:32.955 --> 1:17:35.021
finish the job.

1:17:35.056 --> 1:17:36.759
Yes, sir.

1:17:45.836 --> 1:17:49.266
Put your fucking gun down.

1:17:49.301 --> 1:17:50.465
Now!

1:17:50.500 --> 1:17:53.270
That's right, Jake.

1:17:53.305 --> 1:17:57.373
Let me see that beautiful face.

1:17:57.408 --> 1:17:59.078
Just kill me already.

1:17:59.113 --> 1:18:01.146
No.

1:18:01.181 --> 1:18:03.918
No, Jake, I would
never kill you.

1:18:43.223 --> 1:18:45.025
Come here.

1:19:36.441 --> 1:19:38.243
Come on, damn it.

1:19:43.217 --> 1:19:45.855
Ahh.

1:19:45.890 --> 1:19:47.450
Come on, now.

1:19:50.389 --> 1:19:51.960
Come on.

1:19:51.995 --> 1:19:53.522
Come on, come on.

1:20:37.601 --> 1:20:39.205
- I know what you must
be thinking.

1:20:39.240 --> 1:20:40.910
How did it come to this?

1:20:42.342 --> 1:20:44.507
You can't kill --

1:20:44.542 --> 1:20:46.344
You --

1:20:46.379 --> 1:20:49.413
You can't kill me.

1:20:49.448 --> 1:20:52.086
You hesitate.

1:20:52.121 --> 1:20:54.550
You always hesi--

1:21:40.433 --> 1:21:42.037
- <i> You are clear, runway 2-7.</i>

1:21:42.072 --> 1:21:45.601
<i>Wind 0-3-5 at 7, SH 2.</i>

1:22:07.691 --> 1:22:10.593
Mr. Atherton.

1:22:10.628 --> 1:22:14.300
United States Attorney General
Martin Savoy.

1:22:14.335 --> 1:22:16.005
Sir.

1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:18.601
We've had our eyes
on Section Eight for a while.

1:22:18.636 --> 1:22:22.374
I've had my eyes on you
and Colonel Mason.

1:22:25.478 --> 1:22:27.247
Mason was working for you guys?

1:22:29.053 --> 1:22:32.252
Can't be proven he was working
for anyone.

1:22:32.287 --> 1:22:35.354
Doesn't mean he wasn't, though.

1:22:35.389 --> 1:22:39.325
So Section Eight --
done, dusted?

1:22:39.360 --> 1:22:41.525
You've done something,
Mr. Atherton.

1:22:43.496 --> 1:22:46.200
But we couldn't intervene
until just now.

1:22:46.235 --> 1:22:50.435
The politics just went
too high up the chain.

1:22:50.470 --> 1:22:53.768
You did bring down Sam Ramsey,
though.

1:22:53.803 --> 1:22:56.738
Sam Ramsey.

1:22:56.773 --> 1:22:58.344
He got what he deserved.

1:22:58.379 --> 1:23:01.347
Probably deserved more.

1:23:01.382 --> 1:23:05.153
He was booted from the Agency
several years ago.

1:23:05.188 --> 1:23:07.419
Since then,
he trotted the globe,

1:23:07.454 --> 1:23:10.125
making himself
and every other thug

1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:12.490
that had a grudge against
our country very wealthy,

1:23:12.525 --> 1:23:15.163
selling our ambitions
and dirty laundry.

1:23:15.198 --> 1:23:16.791
Mm.

1:23:16.826 --> 1:23:19.761
Today was a victory.

1:23:19.796 --> 1:23:22.566
But there's still many more
like him out there.

1:23:24.636 --> 1:23:27.373
And we can use the help

1:23:27.408 --> 1:23:30.376
of someone like you
to track them down.

1:23:30.411 --> 1:23:35.612
I'm supposed to be serving
a life sentence, sir.

1:23:35.647 --> 1:23:37.647
Yeah.

1:23:37.682 --> 1:23:39.715
You know,

1:23:39.750 --> 1:23:43.257
I don't see a cause for that.

1:23:43.292 --> 1:23:46.095
It's the least
we can do for you.

1:23:46.130 --> 1:23:49.395
After everything you've done.

1:23:49.430 --> 1:23:51.265
How about a clean slate?

1:23:51.300 --> 1:23:52.695
Just like that?

1:23:52.730 --> 1:23:54.103
Just like that.

1:23:55.700 --> 1:23:57.271
I appreciate the offer, sir,

1:23:57.306 --> 1:24:00.670
but I have nothing left
to fight for.

1:24:00.705 --> 1:24:02.672
You know,
I don't see it that way.

1:24:02.707 --> 1:24:04.179
Sir.

1:24:04.214 --> 1:24:05.708
We found a briefcase inside.

1:24:05.743 --> 1:24:07.347
Along with these.

1:24:09.582 --> 1:24:12.352
Thank you, Agent Morrow.

1:24:12.387 --> 1:24:14.849
I need to get going.

1:24:14.884 --> 1:24:16.752
But I do hope
you'll consider our offer.

1:24:19.295 --> 1:24:21.163
Thank you, sir.

1:24:49.358 --> 1:24:51.325
You have a beautiful family.

1:24:53.494 --> 1:24:56.330
It<i> was</i> a beautiful family, yeah.

1:24:57.663 --> 1:25:00.664
Oh.

1:25:00.699 --> 1:25:02.468
That's a shame.

1:25:11.743 --> 1:25:14.414
What are you doing here?

1:25:14.449 --> 1:25:15.646
It's over.

1:25:17.452 --> 1:25:19.419
Not for me, it isn't.

1:25:20.917 --> 1:25:24.259
Ramsey sent you.
Ramsey's dead.

1:25:24.294 --> 1:25:26.624
Ramsey gave me a job to do.

1:25:26.659 --> 1:25:29.957
My reputation dictates that
that job needs to be finished.

1:25:29.992 --> 1:25:33.565
Whether he's alive or dead
is inconsequential.

1:25:36.273 --> 1:25:39.373
Well, then.

1:25:39.408 --> 1:25:41.672
Put me out of my misery.

1:25:43.973 --> 1:25:45.775
That certainly is the plan.

1:25:49.418 --> 1:25:52.320
You want to know
how I found you here?

1:25:52.355 --> 1:25:55.752
How I tracked you down?

1:25:55.787 --> 1:25:58.689
You are predictable.

1:26:20.845 --> 1:26:22.581
We done?

1:26:22.616 --> 1:26:25.452
No, we're just getting started,
mate.

1:27:21.004 --> 1:27:23.543
-Okay.
-Come on!

1:27:26.416 --> 1:27:29.351
I hope you know how to use
one of these.

1:28:11.626 --> 1:28:13.989
Little fucking dick.

1:28:49.158 --> 1:28:50.927
Are we done?

1:28:56.473 --> 1:28:58.803
We're done.

1:29:21.993 --> 1:29:24.631
- <i> Uncle Earl.</i>

1:29:24.666 --> 1:29:28.437
<i>Sorry I couldn't be there</i>
<i>to say goodbye in person.</i>

1:29:28.472 --> 1:29:30.472
<i>I really am.</i>

1:29:30.507 --> 1:29:32.199
<i>When you get this voicemail,</i>

1:29:32.234 --> 1:29:37.138
<i>know that you saved me</i>
<i>in more ways than one.</i>

1:29:37.173 --> 1:29:39.173
<i>The way my dad</i>
<i>gave his life for yours</i>

1:29:39.208 --> 1:29:42.814
<i>and you gave your life for me.</i>

1:29:42.849 --> 1:29:44.585
<i>You took me in.</i>

1:29:44.620 --> 1:29:47.885
<i>You taught me duty and honor</i>

1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:49.920
<i>in a world that has none.</i>

1:29:49.955 --> 1:29:54.089
<i>You showed me love</i>
<i>like my own father.</i>

1:29:54.124 --> 1:29:56.894
<i>When I had none.</i>

1:29:56.929 --> 1:30:00.700
<i>I was as much a son to you</i>
<i>as I was to my father.</i>

1:30:00.735 --> 1:30:03.230
<i>You know, I --</i>

1:30:03.265 --> 1:30:05.639
<i>I said once I had no family,</i>

1:30:05.674 --> 1:30:07.905
<i>no son, no wife, no father,</i>

1:30:07.940 --> 1:30:09.907
<i>nothing to lose.</i>

1:30:09.942 --> 1:30:14.241
<i>But, Uncle Earl, I know</i>
<i>I'll always have you.</i>

1:30:14.276 --> 1:30:16.518
<i>And I won't lose you too.</i>

1:30:18.181 --> 1:30:20.489
<i>So I'm gonna be going away</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

1:30:20.524 --> 1:30:22.920
<i>It's -- It's just the way</i>
<i>it's got to be.</i>

1:30:22.955 --> 1:30:26.187
<i>And, you know, maybe we'll see</i>
<i>each other again</i>

1:30:26.222 --> 1:30:28.596
<i>in this life</i>
<i>or the other one.</i>

1:30:28.631 --> 1:30:30.895
I'm gonna see him again.

1:30:30.930 --> 1:30:34.833
- <i> You're a good man,</i>
<i>and I hope I make you proud.</i>

1:30:34.868 --> 1:30:36.670
<i>I love you, Uncle Earl.</i>

1:31:24.082 --> 1:31:26.082
- <i> Mr. Atherton.</i>

1:31:26.117 --> 1:31:29.118
Savoy.

1:31:29.153 --> 1:31:31.857
Hm.

1:31:31.892 --> 1:31:35.190
I found something to fight for.

1:31:35.225 --> 1:31:37.731
- <i> Glad to hear that.</i>

1:31:37.766 --> 1:31:39.898
<i>We'll be in touch.</i>

1:31:39.933 --> 1:31:42.670
