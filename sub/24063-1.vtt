01:02.695 --> 01:04.495
'Okay, this can't happen again.'

01:04.497 --> 01:06.265
'This mask is not where
it was supposed to be.'

01:06.266 --> 01:07.533
The flowers were not where
they're supposed to be.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.134
So this needs to
be on stage left.

01:09.135 --> 01:10.569
'This needs be on stage right.'

01:10.570 --> 01:12.504
'And that's that-how
that works.'

01:12.505 --> 01:14.239
'Arms, make your last embrace.'

01:14.240 --> 01:16.141
'And lips, you are the
doors of breath.'

01:16.142 --> 01:17.509
Seal with a righteous kiss

01:17.510 --> 01:19.645
the deal I have made
with death forever.

01:19.646 --> 01:21.547
And then in this part,
I go in for the kiss.

01:21.548 --> 01:23.650
Ah, Romeo, don't get
ahead of yourself.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.588
See you on set.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.857
So here's my take
on a high school

01:31.858 --> 01:34.326
veteran journalist that I am.

01:34.327 --> 01:38.330
Just about everything we do,
we do because we are afraid.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.333
'Hey, Angela, over here.'

01:42.802 --> 01:45.537
Afraid of not being able
to get into college.

01:45.538 --> 01:48.108
Afraid of not being able
to pay for college.

01:49.776 --> 01:53.245
Afraid of not being able to
meet our parents' expectations.

01:53.246 --> 01:56.348
Afraid of being
socially isolated.

01:56.349 --> 01:58.884
Afraid of our futures.
Afraid of our pasts.

01:58.885 --> 02:00.752
Afraid of being alone.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.255
Jordan, Angela,
let me get a pic.

02:03.256 --> 02:05.390
Smile.

02:05.391 --> 02:08.327
And even though a part of me
knows that these fears are

02:08.328 --> 02:10.829
for the most part,
suburban, cry me a river

02:10.830 --> 02:14.700
hashtag stop-whining-like
a-little-baby type problems

02:14.701 --> 02:17.636
it is also true that sometimes

02:17.637 --> 02:20.640
our fear is
completely justified.

02:23.877 --> 02:26.845
My dear Juliet.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.915
Why are you still so beautiful?

02:30.550 --> 02:33.318
Did you get good pics?

02:33.319 --> 02:35.621
Oh, sorry for asking.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.789
'I'll forget about
all the bad luck'

02:37.790 --> 02:40.526
that has troubled me.

02:40.527 --> 02:45.397
Eyes, look out for
the last time.

02:45.398 --> 02:48.600
Arms, make your last embrace.

02:48.601 --> 02:53.872
And lips, you are the
doors to breath.

02:53.873 --> 02:56.475
- Powerful performance.
- Nate.

02:56.476 --> 02:59.912
Well, seriously though, Jordan
just oozes masculinity.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.581
He's like Brando out there.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.483
And Angela is Juliet.

03:04.484 --> 03:07.519
I mean, she plays
comatose really well.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.221
She's actually almost
making me forget

03:09.222 --> 03:10.956
the degree to which she's
a full-blown bitch.

03:10.957 --> 03:12.959
Stop.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.963
Come, bitter poison.

03:18.665 --> 03:22.501
Come, unsavory guide,
you desperate pilot.

03:22.502 --> 03:25.471
Set the sea-weary
ship into the rocks.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.778
Here's to my love.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.321
Oh.

03:42.322 --> 03:44.990
'That pharmacist was honest.'

03:44.991 --> 03:47.993
His drugs work quickly.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.330
So I die with a kiss.

04:08.648 --> 04:09.749
Romeo?

04:10.383 --> 04:13.852
Romeo?

04:13.853 --> 04:15.454
Jordan?

04:15.455 --> 04:16.488
'Jordan!'

04:17.923 --> 04:19.858
Somebody, help me!

04:54.527 --> 04:59.498
'When a free radical is
introduced to a closed system'

04:59.499 --> 05:04.503
the potential result is an
explosive chemical reaction.

05:04.504 --> 05:06.905
Excuse me, Jane, if I may?

05:06.906 --> 05:09.841
Uh, yes, Ms. Pope.

05:09.842 --> 05:12.511
Hi, everyone.

05:12.512 --> 05:16.948
So, we've all been through a
very traumatic experience

05:16.949 --> 05:19.618
with the death of Jordan.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.055
And I would like to
introduce Emily Hodges.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.090
She's a grief counselor.

05:25.091 --> 05:27.459
This is gonna be awkward.

05:27.460 --> 05:28.794
Is your mom counseling
or grieving...

05:28.795 --> 05:30.962
- Shut up.
- I'm just saying.

05:30.963 --> 05:33.765
Hi.

05:33.766 --> 05:36.869
I know many of you are
feeling anxiety..

05:38.371 --> 05:43.075
Stress, deep loss, and sadness.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.845
These feelings are
very hard to process

05:47.080 --> 05:50.349
and they are completely normal.

05:50.350 --> 05:51.917
Please come talk to me.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.618
I have an office next to Ms.
Pope's

05:53.619 --> 05:55.688
and my door is always open.

05:56.856 --> 05:59.057
And on a final note

05:59.058 --> 06:01.893
there will likely be
reporters poking around here

06:01.894 --> 06:05.765
over the next few days asking
questions about Jordan.

06:06.899 --> 06:09.401
I wanna be very clear.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.637
No one is to talk to the media.

06:13.506 --> 06:16.476
Let's just keep this within
the Westbrook family.

06:18.811 --> 06:20.580
Thank you, Jane.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.562
Must be so weird.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.998
What? Being the grief
counselor's daughter

06:39.999 --> 06:43.034
and having her right here
all up in my business?

06:43.035 --> 06:44.436
Oh, yeah. It's delightful.

06:44.437 --> 06:46.738
Come on, you guys are so tight.

06:46.739 --> 06:48.740
See, but I'm working on the
whole teen angst thing

06:48.741 --> 06:50.810
and I feel like I should
be saying she sucks.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.047
- Hey, Nate.
- What am I, chopped liver?

06:56.048 --> 06:58.483
Wait for it. God, almost..

06:58.484 --> 06:59.985
Wait for it.

06:59.986 --> 07:02.088
Yeah. Got it. Yeah.

07:05.124 --> 07:07.426
Nate, that's so mean.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.095
It's all part of my charm.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.530
Dude, show them the
one from the play.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.932
Oh, of Jordan? Slightly
less charming.

07:13.933 --> 07:17.436
- 'Little horrific, actually.'
- Oh, I can't look at these.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.971
Jordan was my first
"â™ªSquadGoals" interview.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.441
That's so sad.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.676
So what, they're saying it
was his peanut allergy?

07:24.677 --> 07:26.778
It's so weird you
can die from that.

07:26.779 --> 07:28.513
I don't even get
how it happened.

07:28.514 --> 07:30.182
He was so vigilant about it.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.650
I mean, the whole school was.

07:31.651 --> 07:32.984
There was nothing
in the lunchroom.

07:32.985 --> 07:34.719
Nothing in the vending machines.

07:34.720 --> 07:36.521
I know, it's so unfair. I
haven't had a Snickers bar

07:36.522 --> 07:38.657
since, like, middle school.

07:38.658 --> 07:41.126
I'm just saying my rights
have been violated.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.662
Rumor has it, this totally
opens up the scholarship.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.564
Yeah, Jordan was a shoo-in.

07:45.565 --> 07:47.098
You mean, the whole
World Patrons thing?

07:47.099 --> 07:48.800
Oh, it's a sweet deal.
I mean, full books

07:48.801 --> 07:50.202
and board, everything.

07:50.203 --> 07:51.603
Hey, maybe I have a shot now.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.104
Probably better shot than I do.

07:53.105 --> 07:55.474
Wrong. You're perfect for it.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.876
The top citizen at Westbrook.
That's a laugh.

07:57.877 --> 07:59.978
So, uh, how's the yearbook
going, by the way?

07:59.979 --> 08:02.147
Oh, it's fine. Whatever.

08:02.148 --> 08:04.950
It's genius. People are actually
gonna buy it this year.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.651
- Stop.
- 'I'm serious.'

08:06.652 --> 08:09.588
Interviewing every clique.
I love it.

08:09.589 --> 08:12.624
You got the granolas,
the emos, the nerds.

08:12.625 --> 08:13.992
Hello!

08:13.993 --> 08:15.961
But how am I supposed to focus

08:15.962 --> 08:18.163
on the yearbook when this
whole death by peanut thing

08:18.164 --> 08:20.732
is so suspicious, right?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.034
- Little bit, yeah.
- What do you mean?

08:23.035 --> 08:25.504
He had an allergy. I mean,
people die from that.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.838
We even had an
assembly about it.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.840
I'm not denying he had
an allergy, Gill.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.276
- It's just.. Pope...
- Is a horrible person?

08:31.277 --> 08:33.578
That, and the fact that
the first thing she said

08:33.578 --> 08:35.580
was don't talk to the media.

08:35.581 --> 08:36.847
That's something you
say when you're trying

08:36.849 --> 08:38.149
'to cover something up.'

08:38.150 --> 08:40.018
Yeah, remember the whole
media blackout thing

08:40.019 --> 08:41.520
after the grade inflation?

08:41.520 --> 08:43.255
I mean, she's a total
corporate robot.

08:43.256 --> 08:45.557
You guys are so paranoid.

08:45.558 --> 08:47.893
I'm just saying, my
Spidey sense is tingling.

08:47.894 --> 08:50.128
- It is weird.
- Oh, you mean Rudy?

08:50.129 --> 08:52.931
Well, yeah, Rudy. But,
the whole Jordan thing.

08:52.932 --> 08:54.032
I mean, somebody
should dig into it.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.235
Sounds like a job for you, girl.

08:57.236 --> 08:59.204
- What?
- You're the reporter.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.872
I mean, look, we already
have to do interviews.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.741
You might as well kill two
birds with one stone.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.843
'See if your Spidey
sense is on point.'

09:04.844 --> 09:06.278
- I like it.
- Sweet.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.281
Let's you and me do
some interviews.

09:13.653 --> 09:16.221
So, what do you know?

09:16.222 --> 09:19.658
Not much more than I
told you last night.

09:19.659 --> 09:21.961
The police department isn't
going to investigate?

09:23.996 --> 09:26.065
Let's talk in my office.

09:29.835 --> 09:34.639
The police are saying they still
have some unanswered questions.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.043
And, uh, I am going to
do everything I can

09:38.044 --> 09:40.312
to get to the bottom of this.

09:40.313 --> 09:44.584
But this is a particularly
delicate situation.

09:45.351 --> 09:49.020
So, when you talk to the kids

09:49.021 --> 09:53.325
I'm gonna need you to tell me
everything that you find out.

09:53.326 --> 09:57.162
Well, what the kids say in
session with me is confidential.

09:57.163 --> 10:00.365
'Unless it's relevant
to a crime.'

10:00.366 --> 10:04.202
And we wouldn't want anything
hurting your daughter's school

10:04.203 --> 10:05.838
would we?

10:08.741 --> 10:10.976
No.

10:10.977 --> 10:12.678
Of course not.

10:15.348 --> 10:18.650
Look, I'm not asking you
to do anything illegal.

10:18.651 --> 10:22.087
I just need you to be my
eyes and ears out there.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.391
And if you hear something, I
wanna know about it first.

10:27.026 --> 10:30.061
- Samantha.
- Hey.

10:30.062 --> 10:31.363
How long have you
been standing there?

10:31.364 --> 10:32.897
Oh, just got here.

10:32.898 --> 10:35.200
Um, I'm doing a story
for "Squad Goals"

10:35.201 --> 10:38.336
and I was wondering if
I could talk to you.

10:38.337 --> 10:41.239
Of course, let me just take
your mom to her office.

10:41.240 --> 10:43.275
You can wait here.

11:05.898 --> 11:07.399
I'll be completely candid.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.969
The Reynolds happen to be huge
financial supporters for us.

11:10.970 --> 11:12.871
Very connected to the
Westbrook community.

11:12.872 --> 11:15.674
So, the last thing we need is
for an intrusive investigation

11:15.675 --> 11:18.376
to trigger our biggest backers
to pull their support.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.978
Would they do that?

11:19.979 --> 11:23.014
Trust me, I've been at
the school for 19 years.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.916
Investigations like
this almost always

11:24.917 --> 11:26.785
lead to reckless accusations.

11:26.786 --> 11:30.288
And when one donor pulls out,
it can start an avalanche.

11:30.289 --> 11:33.192
There goes our funding,
our charter and our jobs.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.994
Okay.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.697
I'll do what I can
to try and help.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.265
That's all I'm asking.

11:40.266 --> 11:42.368
Let me know if you
need anything else.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.793
Okay. Samantha, how
can I help you?

12:08.794 --> 12:10.462
This will only take a
minute, I promise.

12:10.463 --> 12:13.031
It's for "Squad Goals"
and I'm on a deadline.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.400
Um, okay, well, I should
tell you now though

12:15.401 --> 12:17.001
I don't know the results
of the student council...

12:17.002 --> 12:19.405
Oh, actually, I'm
not here for that.

12:20.306 --> 12:22.808
What I'd like to know is..

12:24.276 --> 12:25.810
'Um..'

12:25.811 --> 12:27.078
You know what, I'm
really busy right now.

12:27.079 --> 12:28.113
Why don't we reschedule this...

12:28.114 --> 12:29.781
Is it true that

12:29.782 --> 12:31.349
it would be better for you

12:31.350 --> 12:33.885
I mean, for the school

12:33.886 --> 12:37.922
if Jordan's death is
ruled an accident

12:37.923 --> 12:41.059
'rather than something else?'

12:41.060 --> 12:43.995
What, what do you
mean, something else?

12:43.996 --> 12:45.396
Uh, I don't know, I just...

12:45.397 --> 12:48.933
'That's right. You don't know.'

12:48.934 --> 12:51.336
And that was an extremely
inappropriate question.

12:51.337 --> 12:53.938
I don't think your mother
would appreciate that either.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.440
I was just asking...

12:55.441 --> 12:57.942
'You know, why don't you
just go on back to class'

12:57.943 --> 12:59.277
and I will try to forget

12:59.278 --> 13:01.781
just how immensely
disrespectful you were.

13:05.551 --> 13:09.220
'For the record, Samantha'

13:09.221 --> 13:11.457
Jordan's death was an accident..

13:13.092 --> 13:14.927
And it was tragic.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.576
Hey, wait up!

13:31.577 --> 13:33.077
What's so funny?

13:33.078 --> 13:34.813
I was just thinking, Nate

13:34.814 --> 13:36.948
remember how you used to
follow me around everywhere

13:36.949 --> 13:39.317
in elementary school?

13:39.318 --> 13:40.952
- Nate?
- Yeah?

13:40.953 --> 13:42.987
- What are you looking at?
- Uh, nothing.

13:42.988 --> 13:44.389
Uh, hey, what did Pope say?

13:44.390 --> 13:46.591
Did she reveal
anything sinister?

13:46.592 --> 13:49.027
Totally seems like she's
hiding something.

13:49.028 --> 13:50.528
And I did manage to get a copy

13:50.529 --> 13:52.430
of the World Patron
Scholarship finalists.

13:52.431 --> 13:55.567
- No way.
- Are you serious? Let me see.

13:55.568 --> 13:59.370
So after Jordan,
Brittany's next?

13:59.371 --> 14:01.105
Damn, I'm sixth right after Sam.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.341
Hey, I can't even
believe I'm on it.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.610
So, doing the math, if I
decide to forego sleep

14:05.611 --> 14:08.413
for, you know, ever, and work 6:00 p.m.
to 6:00 a.m.

14:08.414 --> 14:11.015
every day of the week including
weekends and holidays

14:11.016 --> 14:14.352
I could afford to pay for
college by, what, year 3000?

14:14.353 --> 14:15.587
I'm in the same boat.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.488
Well, not the early
admission boat

14:17.489 --> 14:20.625
that you two geniuses
are in but still..

14:20.626 --> 14:22.594
I promise. I'll
talk to my parents.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.195
They're on the
selection committee.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.164
We're going to college together.

14:26.165 --> 14:27.899
I'm not a charity case, Gill.

14:27.900 --> 14:29.267
I mean, plus, your
parents hate me, so..

14:29.268 --> 14:31.936
We'll figure it out.

14:31.937 --> 14:34.439
So, Brittany is the favorite
for the scholarship.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.441
It's 'cause she raised 12 grand?

14:36.442 --> 14:38.276
- From a car wash?
- 'You know, big deal.'

14:38.277 --> 14:40.645
So they hem their skirts and
overcharge creepy old men...

14:40.646 --> 14:43.248
- 'And Rudy.'
- To wash their cars.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.216
Real hero of our times.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.886
I spent 30 bucks
on that car wash.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.222
- It was worth every penny.
- Geez.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.325
Ready? Okay!

14:54.326 --> 14:57.997
A-T-T-A-C-K, attack,
attack, attack!

15:07.106 --> 15:09.307
Now, that Brittany's on the
top of the scholarship list

15:09.308 --> 15:11.109
we need to figure
out what she knows.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.612
Only one way to find out.
Let's do an interview.

15:15.147 --> 15:17.215
Hey, guys, good job. I
think, just, you know

15:17.216 --> 15:19.150
a few more practices, I
think we'll be ready to go.

15:19.151 --> 15:21.619
- Yeah.
- Um, Brittany. Uh, hey.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.621
I'm Sam. We're in bio?

15:23.622 --> 15:26.257
Oh, yeah, you're from the
"Squad Goals" blog, right?

15:26.258 --> 15:28.626
Uh, actually, Nate and I
are both in charge of it.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.495
He's doing visuals and I'm...

15:30.496 --> 15:32.297
Making us look good
for posterity?

15:32.298 --> 15:35.466
- Exactly. Um, got a minute?
- Sure.

15:35.467 --> 15:38.136
We just feel like we should get
to know the teams and clubs

15:38.137 --> 15:40.405
personally and get to know
what you're all about.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.006
Awesome.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.541
Um, how would you define

15:43.542 --> 15:45.710
"â™ªSquadGoals" for
the cheer squad?

15:45.711 --> 15:48.579
Well, and this might
sound a little braggy

15:48.580 --> 15:52.317
but I like to think of us as the
heart and soul of the school.

15:52.318 --> 15:54.018
And I know the
stereotype is that

15:54.019 --> 15:56.120
we're silly, slutty, and stupid

15:56.121 --> 15:58.323
but, that's not us.

15:58.324 --> 16:00.491
We get great grades,
we volunteer

16:00.492 --> 16:02.226
and we support our teams.

16:02.227 --> 16:04.595
And I love basketball,
so, it's great.

16:04.596 --> 16:07.131
And forgive me for sounding
like a gossip site

16:07.132 --> 16:09.534
but aside from loving basketball

16:09.535 --> 16:12.170
is there a particular
player that you...

16:12.171 --> 16:14.105
- 'Me and Lance?'
- Yeah.

16:14.106 --> 16:16.507
Yeah, he's my boo.

16:16.508 --> 16:19.310
Uh, humble brag, he's gonna
be playing college ball

16:19.311 --> 16:20.578
for a really great school.

16:20.579 --> 16:23.214
- Wow, that's awesome.
- Yeah.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.383
'And do you have any
personal goals?'

16:25.384 --> 16:26.985
Veterinary medicine.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.753
If I get the World
Patron Scholarship.

16:28.754 --> 16:30.388
Otherwise, it's
community college

16:30.389 --> 16:33.057
until I raise the right
amount of fundage.

16:33.058 --> 16:35.326
Uh, last question.

16:35.327 --> 16:37.662
Uh, how do you feel about Jordan

16:37.663 --> 16:40.565
'with everything
that's happened?'

16:40.566 --> 16:43.101
Oh, um..

16:43.102 --> 16:45.604
Yeah, that really is
a tragedy, isn't it?

16:47.072 --> 16:49.073
I didn't know him very well.

16:49.074 --> 16:52.377
He and Lance were pretty close though.
You should ask him.

16:52.378 --> 16:54.112
Um, listen, I have to
get back to drills

16:54.113 --> 16:55.380
but I love your jacket.

16:55.381 --> 16:56.715
Oh.

16:59.651 --> 17:01.219
Let's go talk to Lance.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.588
College basketball stud.
You got a crush?

17:03.589 --> 17:06.125
He's the next on the list.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.782
Are you gonna behave yourself?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.583
Can I just say that

17:32.584 --> 17:35.353
that really is a nice jacket.

17:35.354 --> 17:37.188
Thanks.

17:37.189 --> 17:39.724
Oh, there he is.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.726
Hi, Lance.

17:41.727 --> 17:44.629
- What's up, Lance?
- Hey, guys, how's it goin'?

17:44.630 --> 17:47.298
Uh, hey, Brittany texted me
about your "Squad Goals" piece.

17:47.299 --> 17:50.501
Oh, yeah. Is it okay if Nate
videos while I interview you?

17:50.502 --> 17:52.537
Yeah. Uh, I don't know that I
have anything interesting to say

17:52.538 --> 17:54.072
but, sure.

17:54.073 --> 17:55.807
Brittany just said
that you're gonna be

17:55.808 --> 17:57.809
playing some college ball.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.179
She's a talker. But,
thanks, yeah, we'll see.

18:01.180 --> 18:02.547
You don't sound very excited.

18:02.548 --> 18:04.315
Oh, no, I am, and
they're offering me

18:04.316 --> 18:06.484
a pretty sweet financial
aid package too.

18:06.485 --> 18:09.153
Not enough. Uh, it's gonna
be pretty tight moneywise.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.521
But, if I get that scholarship

18:10.522 --> 18:13.291
'then I should be
able to swing it.'

18:13.292 --> 18:14.625
Uh, I'm sorry, you probably want

18:14.626 --> 18:16.160
something a little
more quotable.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.297
Um, how 'bout, uh, I
got a great girlfriend

18:19.298 --> 18:20.798
and we have the best high
school with the best students

18:20.799 --> 18:23.234
and teachers, coaches.

18:23.235 --> 18:24.669
Westbrook's really made
me who I am today.

18:24.670 --> 18:27.171
I'm truly blessed.

18:27.172 --> 18:28.439
Bringin' on the cliches.

18:28.440 --> 18:31.175
Okay, look, I'm sorry. Um..

18:31.176 --> 18:34.445
I mean, basketball's been
really good to me, you know?

18:34.446 --> 18:37.181
Ra-ra, right? But..

18:37.182 --> 18:39.484
It's not who I am.

18:39.485 --> 18:41.719
I mean, uh, yeah,
it's a part of it

18:41.720 --> 18:44.856
'but it's not me.'

18:44.857 --> 18:46.791
There's just..

18:46.792 --> 18:48.559
I'm sorry, I am rambling.

18:48.560 --> 18:52.563
No, actually, you're the first
person I've interviewed

18:52.564 --> 18:56.167
that said anything
remotely real.

18:56.168 --> 18:58.903
We're also asking
everybody about Jordan.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.739
Can you talk about that?

19:01.740 --> 19:04.242
Uh, you know, I didn't really
know him all that well.

19:04.243 --> 19:07.478
Oh, really? Brittany said
you guys were friends.

19:07.479 --> 19:08.880
I don't know how
she figured that.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.481
Uh, look, I gotta get
back to practice.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.217
But, thanks, guys.

19:13.552 --> 19:14.887
Thanks.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.489
What was that all about?

19:18.490 --> 19:19.857
Not a happy fellow.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.793
Why? He's got everything.

19:23.695 --> 19:26.664
- You know something.
- No, I don't.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.267
Dude, I'm a reporter. I
know BS when I see it

19:29.268 --> 19:31.369
and you are BSing me.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.737
I might have heard a
few things, yeah.

19:32.738 --> 19:36.474
- Like what?
- I don't do gossip, Sam.

19:36.475 --> 19:37.708
Okay.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.845
I'm more of a
straight-ahead prick.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.408
Hello?

20:47.646 --> 20:49.248
Anybody there?

22:41.526 --> 22:43.094
- Hey, mom.
- 'Hey, mom?'

22:43.095 --> 22:44.962
'Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. Stop.'

22:44.963 --> 22:46.464
Hey, mom?

22:46.465 --> 22:48.399
That's all I'm gonna get?

22:48.400 --> 22:51.502
Well, um, love you?

22:51.503 --> 22:54.505
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. I'm good.

22:54.506 --> 22:56.640
Uh-huh, you don't seem fine.

22:56.641 --> 23:00.578
No, really. Um, school's just
a little crazy, that's all.

23:00.579 --> 23:03.147
Well, I had a little chat with Ms.
Pope this afternoon

23:03.148 --> 23:05.015
and guess what the subject was.

23:05.016 --> 23:06.984
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

23:06.985 --> 23:09.920
Why on earth would you
accuse your principal

23:09.921 --> 23:13.691
who is my boss, by
the way, of a crime?

23:13.692 --> 23:15.126
That is what you did, right?

23:15.127 --> 23:17.628
I wasn't accusing her
of anything, mom.

23:17.629 --> 23:18.963
I was just asking if may...

23:18.964 --> 23:21.599
If she was complicit

23:21.600 --> 23:25.803
in a criminal conspiracy that
resulted in a young man's death.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.839
I'm just trying to figure
out exactly what happened

23:28.840 --> 23:30.841
because apparently,
no one else is.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.811
- Excuse me?
- I'm just saying.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.647
It doesn't seem like anyone's
the slightest bit interested

23:36.648 --> 23:38.916
in getting to the bottom
of Jordan's death.

23:38.917 --> 23:41.152
All Ms. Pope cares
about is test scores

23:41.153 --> 23:42.820
and appearances and...

23:42.821 --> 23:46.891
You are not even 18. How
are you such a cynic?

23:46.892 --> 23:49.560
I'm a reporter and we're not
getting the full story.

23:49.561 --> 23:52.463
You are not a reporter yet.

23:52.464 --> 23:54.031
You are a high school student

23:54.032 --> 23:56.534
'with a chance to
get into college.'

23:56.535 --> 23:59.637
All I'm saying is don't blow it.

23:59.638 --> 24:02.940
Please? And..

24:02.941 --> 24:05.075
Apologize to Ms. Pope first
thing in the morning.

24:05.076 --> 24:06.977
Okay?

24:06.978 --> 24:08.846
Okay.

24:08.847 --> 24:11.615
I gotta go upstairs.

24:11.616 --> 24:14.018
And then you're coming right
back down for dinner.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.520
- 'Yeah.'
- Yes.

24:16.521 --> 24:17.823
'Yes.'

24:21.493 --> 24:25.196
No, no, no, no, of course.
Of course.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.631
Ye-yes, and please know
that I am doubling down

24:27.632 --> 24:29.500
on my efforts to make
Westbrook High School

24:29.501 --> 24:31.937
the safest high
school in the city.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.241
Okay. B-bye.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.111
Oh, God. Sam, what is it?

24:41.112 --> 24:44.182
- May I come in?
- 'Yes, you may.'

24:49.888 --> 24:53.090
I just wanted to
say I'm so sorry

24:53.091 --> 24:55.493
about our conversation
yesterday.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.097
'I didn't mean to imply
anything about anything.'

25:00.599 --> 25:03.033
I'm just upset, we all are

25:03.034 --> 25:06.637
and I guess I was just trying

25:06.638 --> 25:09.039
to sort through some
stuff, you know.

25:09.040 --> 25:11.041
'Figure stuff out.'

25:11.042 --> 25:16.981
Okay, well, next time you need
to sort through some stuff

25:16.982 --> 25:20.684
I suggest you sort it
through with your mother.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.087
I will.

25:24.589 --> 25:27.258
You need to watch
your step, Samantha.

25:27.259 --> 25:29.927
Just because your
mom works here now

25:29.928 --> 25:32.898
doesn't give you free reign to
treat adults with disrespect.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.979
How you doing, man? You okay?

25:48.980 --> 25:50.881
Yeah, I'm good. A
little creeped out.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.583
But that's pretty
normal around here.

25:52.584 --> 25:53.884
Yeah, me too.

25:53.885 --> 25:55.819
I mean, everybody's grieving.

25:55.820 --> 25:58.656
- And I've been thinking.
- That's a first.

25:58.657 --> 26:00.124
You know what would
really help everyone?

26:00.125 --> 26:02.593
I mean, what would, what would
start the healing process?

26:02.594 --> 26:05.162
- What?
- A massive blowout party.

26:05.163 --> 26:06.964
Dude, my parents are going
out of town tonight.

26:06.965 --> 26:08.299
Yeah? You should
invite everyone.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.100
Hell, yeah, Nate. And
bring your camera

26:10.101 --> 26:11.669
'cause it's gonna be insane.

26:11.670 --> 26:14.038
Hey, look at this
picture of Sam.

26:14.039 --> 26:15.806
Yeah, it's cute. What about it?

26:15.807 --> 26:16.941
You think she'll
be at your party?

26:16.942 --> 26:19.243
Her mom's on the strict trip.

26:19.244 --> 26:21.345
- Ah, dude.
- What?

26:21.346 --> 26:23.047
Come on, are you
gonna ask Sam out

26:23.048 --> 26:24.815
or you're just gonna keep
annoying the crap out of me?

26:24.816 --> 26:27.251
Okay, well, one, those
aren't mutually exclusive.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.954
- And, two, I will ask her out.
- When?

26:29.955 --> 26:31.855
I'm laying the groundwork.
I need a little time.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.757
You're laying the
groundwork, how?

26:33.758 --> 26:36.627
Yeah, I told her she
has a nice jacket.

26:36.628 --> 26:38.662
Oh, and I thought I had no game.

26:38.663 --> 26:41.165
It's a process, dude. I'm
just laying seed here.

26:41.166 --> 26:43.133
Laying seed?

26:43.134 --> 26:45.970
Now we gotta let it grow.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.672
At least something's
getting laid.

26:48.673 --> 26:50.942
Let me see the picture.

26:52.844 --> 26:54.679
It is really nice.

26:57.882 --> 27:00.084
Okay, guys, let's talk Axis II.

27:00.085 --> 27:02.052
When we're talking about
Axis II disorders

27:02.053 --> 27:04.888
and that term is rapidly
becoming antiquated

27:04.889 --> 27:08.025
what we're talking about
are personality disorders.

27:08.026 --> 27:10.294
Thank you, Rudy.
Please have a seat.

27:10.295 --> 27:13.664
'Borderline, paranoid,
antisocial, narcissistic'

27:13.665 --> 27:15.399
'all real fun stuff.'

27:15.400 --> 27:17.067
I've got good news, my friend.

27:17.068 --> 27:19.637
And it probably describes
about two-thirds

27:19.638 --> 27:21.672
of the student body at
my last high school.

27:21.673 --> 27:23.007
- What?
- 'I'm just kidding.'

27:23.008 --> 27:24.708
I'm having a party
tomorrow night.

27:24.709 --> 27:26.977
Rudy!

27:26.978 --> 27:29.747
Do you have something to
share with the class?

27:29.748 --> 27:33.050
Oh, uh, yes. I, I'm having
a party tomorrow night

27:33.051 --> 27:34.885
and I'd love for you to come.

27:34.886 --> 27:37.688
Okay, well, I'm flattered,
but that ain't gonna happen.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.256
'Now, back to the lesson.'

27:39.257 --> 27:40.991
'Big generalization coming'

27:40.992 --> 27:43.260
'but for a lot of these
maladaptive personalities'

27:43.261 --> 27:45.763
do you know what the most
common shared traits are?

27:45.764 --> 27:48.198
Of course, selfishness
and grandiosity

27:48.199 --> 27:50.734
thinking you're the bee's
knees are tied for first

27:50.735 --> 27:55.072
but the other trait that
you always see is sarcasm.

27:55.073 --> 27:57.341
Now, write this down.

27:57.342 --> 28:01.046
'Sarcasm is really just
hostility disguised as humor.'

28:12.957 --> 28:15.793
'I mean, yeah, it's a
part, but it's not me.'

28:15.794 --> 28:19.396
'We're also asking
everybody about Jordan.'

28:19.397 --> 28:22.332
Um, I-I didn't really
know him all that well.

28:22.333 --> 28:24.868
Look, I gotta, I gotta
get back to practice.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.804
Thanks.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.139
'Thanks.'

28:54.265 --> 28:55.999
'I invited your mom,
but she told me'

28:56.000 --> 28:57.434
she's not gonna come.

28:57.435 --> 28:59.169
Enjoying my computer?

28:59.170 --> 29:01.004
Shared all the pics
for the paper.

29:01.005 --> 29:04.141
- We're on deadline, Natie.
- Some of those are personal.

29:04.142 --> 29:06.210
Come on, I've know you
since kindergarten.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.378
How personal can it get?

29:08.379 --> 29:10.881
But seriously, you've been
doing some really good work.

29:10.882 --> 29:14.084
- So artistic.
- See, I'm artsy.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.519
So how is the investigation
coming along?

29:15.520 --> 29:17.855
Uh, you know, no
solid leads yet.

29:17.856 --> 29:19.423
We need to do a lot
more footwork, but..

29:19.424 --> 29:21.191
You could do some
digging at my party.

29:21.192 --> 29:22.493
Everyone's coming.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.027
Did he mention he's
having a party?

29:24.028 --> 29:26.330
I'm having a party.

29:26.331 --> 29:29.501
Oh, damn. I am late for PE.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.972
See you later, Nate.

29:36.808 --> 29:39.777
Dude, she's so into you. I
mean, did you see her shirt?

29:39.778 --> 29:42.913
There's literally
cameras on the shirt.

29:42.914 --> 29:45.149
Yeah, I mean, well, but..

29:45.150 --> 29:46.885
- But Sam.
- Yeah.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.454
Hey, guys.

29:50.455 --> 29:51.922
I'm gonna handle
this for you, brah.

29:51.923 --> 29:55.459
Sam, Nate. Nate, Sam.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.795
Sam, Nate has something
he wants to tell you.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.197
And I'm a ghost.

30:00.865 --> 30:03.100
'Ladies.'

30:03.101 --> 30:05.803
Okay, I'm gonna say
something to you.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.337
Okay.

30:07.338 --> 30:09.439
But before I do, let me
just say that I had a plan

30:09.440 --> 30:11.842
to wait for the perfect moment,
you know, like a movie moment

30:11.843 --> 30:14.178
where we could be in
a situation, like

30:14.179 --> 30:16.446
one of those cool situations,
and I could spontaneously...

30:16.447 --> 30:19.249
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

30:19.250 --> 30:21.285
Me either. Let me
just start over.

30:21.286 --> 30:24.188
So, you know I'm a
big, bitter, sarcastic

30:24.189 --> 30:27.991
dark doofus, right?

30:27.992 --> 30:30.894
- Right.
- 'Wow, this is embarrassing.'

30:30.895 --> 30:35.265
Uh, I'm a big dark doofus who
has a big, big crush on you.

30:35.266 --> 30:38.402
There, I said it. Now
Rudy can leave me alone.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.070
And don't say anything.
We're friends, I know.

30:40.071 --> 30:42.339
You can just, you know,
sit with it for a bit

30:42.340 --> 30:45.342
humor me, and then
reject me later.

30:45.343 --> 30:48.111
Can I say something now?

30:48.112 --> 30:49.514
Please do.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.851
I have a crush on you too.

30:53.852 --> 30:57.621
- You do?
- I do, dufus.

30:57.622 --> 31:00.191
Well, then that's
pretty awesome.

31:02.460 --> 31:05.362
But, we can't do anything.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.297
You've got to talk to Gillian.

31:07.298 --> 31:09.366
'She has a major crush on you.'

31:09.367 --> 31:11.001
No kidding.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.370
Look, she's my best friend

31:13.371 --> 31:16.373
and I'm not about to sneak
around behind her back.

31:16.374 --> 31:18.175
Talk to her.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.043
Uh, man, okay.

31:20.044 --> 31:23.213
Nate, if you want any of this

31:23.214 --> 31:25.515
you gotta do the right thing.

31:25.516 --> 31:29.119
All over it. I will talk
to her at the party.

31:29.120 --> 31:30.388
Okay.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.136
- Welcome to Rudy's paradise.
- Thank you.

32:19.137 --> 32:21.038
Ladies, we have a
date for a rendezvous

32:21.039 --> 32:23.707
in exactly four drinks. Capeesh?
Capeesh? Alright.

32:23.708 --> 32:26.276
Yeah! It is on.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.578
Shall we retreat to
my secret chamber?

32:28.579 --> 32:30.315
- Okay.
- Come on.

32:43.728 --> 32:46.330
Holy crap. It is loud out there.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.698
You asked for it, my man.

32:47.699 --> 32:49.499
Yeah, but what the hell's
the matter with you?

32:49.500 --> 32:52.169
You know I have no judgment.
You're supposed to stop me

32:52.170 --> 32:53.704
when I come up with
this kind of stuff.

32:53.705 --> 32:56.173
Um, what's with all the weapons?

32:56.174 --> 32:58.041
Oh, it's, uh, it's
my dad's hobby.

32:58.042 --> 33:00.677
But listen, nobody but us is
allowed in this room, okay?

33:00.678 --> 33:03.180
I can handle the beatings for
the general house damage.

33:03.181 --> 33:05.649
But anything in here, and I'll
never see the light of day.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.017
Look, Sam, let's
get out of here.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.087
This place is creeping me out.

33:12.490 --> 33:15.192
Alright, let's go find you
a woman of loose morals.

33:15.193 --> 33:16.594
Yes, that.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.749
Whoa!

33:38.750 --> 33:41.118
Wow, okay, boss. Whoa!

33:41.119 --> 33:43.588
I'm not your boss. I
need to talk to you.

33:52.463 --> 33:54.431
- So, what's up?
- I need to ask you something.

33:54.432 --> 33:56.033
- Okay, shoot.
- Okay.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.735
So, I know you and Sam are

33:58.736 --> 34:01.304
I don't know, flirting, which..

34:01.305 --> 34:04.541
I get, I guess. I mean,
she's so cute and...

34:04.542 --> 34:07.811
- Gillian, we're...
- Let me finish.

34:07.812 --> 34:09.513
I mean, we've been friends
since kindergarten.

34:09.514 --> 34:12.681
I think I deserve a
little bit of attention.

34:12.683 --> 34:15.820
I need to know how
you feel about me.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.629
Hey, Gill.

34:25.630 --> 34:27.664
Hey.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.498
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.701
I'm going to the bathroom.

34:31.702 --> 34:35.304
- Is that okay.
- Well, do you want me to come?

34:35.306 --> 34:38.141
It's okay, Sam. I've been going
by myself since I was six.

34:41.646 --> 34:44.715
- Hey, have you seen Nate?
- Nah. Check upstairs, maybe.

35:03.234 --> 35:05.303
Hey, Brittany, have
you seen Nate?

35:09.640 --> 35:12.109
You okay?

35:12.110 --> 35:13.677
Yeah.

35:13.678 --> 35:15.146
Um..

35:16.881 --> 35:20.217
Hey, Sam. Um, I'm sorry.

35:20.218 --> 35:22.185
It's just..

35:22.186 --> 35:24.255
Why are you crying?

35:28.559 --> 35:31.762
I came up here to fix
my lipstick and, um..

35:32.864 --> 35:34.332
What?

35:37.902 --> 35:40.171
I found this in my bag.

35:45.309 --> 35:48.446
- Is that..
- Jordan kissing my boyfriend?

35:56.921 --> 35:58.322
Yeah.

36:00.925 --> 36:03.361
Who would give this to you?

36:04.662 --> 36:06.696
Well, it wasn't Lance.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.598
I just talked to him about
it and he said that

36:08.599 --> 36:10.535
'he doesn't know
how it got there.'

36:11.802 --> 36:14.572
Honestly, right now,
I really don't care.

36:17.308 --> 36:19.477
I'm so sorry, Brittany.

36:21.779 --> 36:25.249
The truth is, it's not really
a huge surprise to me.

36:26.851 --> 36:29.287
Obviously, Jordan was..

36:30.521 --> 36:32.722
Pretty obvious.

36:32.723 --> 36:35.759
'And Lance and I..'

36:35.760 --> 36:37.928
He told me before
that he had these..

36:37.929 --> 36:42.532
Feelings, you know,
about himself

36:42.533 --> 36:45.403
which is fine.

36:46.604 --> 36:48.505
You know, feelings or feelings

36:48.506 --> 36:49.906
and I'm not judgmental

36:49.907 --> 36:52.643
but this is just making
me look like a fool.

36:58.216 --> 36:59.584
Brittany.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.821
Leave me alone, Lance.

37:12.997 --> 37:15.399
Do you want me to talk to him?

37:21.372 --> 37:22.740
Whatever.

37:26.711 --> 37:27.979
Okay.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.428
Hey, check this out.

37:45.429 --> 37:47.931
Oh, hey, so, I saw Gillian.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.666
I guess you talked to her.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.636
Yeah, it was pretty brutal.
You wanna talk?

37:52.637 --> 37:54.972
Later. I gotta find Lance.

38:13.858 --> 38:15.493
Hello?

38:16.994 --> 38:18.796
Who's there?

38:19.964 --> 38:21.732
Lance?

38:35.846 --> 38:38.348
No, that's, that's
fine, I mean..

38:38.349 --> 38:40.350
- Have you seen Lance?
- What?

38:40.351 --> 38:41.985
Have you seen Lance?

38:41.986 --> 38:45.689
I, no, I, I haven't got
in anybody's pants.

38:45.690 --> 38:47.490
I'm just kidding. Okay?

38:47.491 --> 38:50.360
I.. I, no. I mean, I
haven't seen Lance.

38:50.361 --> 38:51.562
Why, what-what's the..

38:54.565 --> 38:57.600
- 'What happened?'
- 'Did you see that?'

38:57.601 --> 38:59.570
'Get an ambulance.'

39:10.848 --> 39:14.918
Brittany.

39:14.919 --> 39:17.855
No, I'm so sorry.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.709
- So you just turned 18?
- Uh, last week.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.845
Happy birthday to me, right?

39:41.846 --> 39:44.047
I'm sorry. I'm really nervous.

39:44.048 --> 39:46.483
There's no need to
be nervous, son.

39:46.484 --> 39:48.651
'You just need to
tell me the truth.'

39:48.652 --> 39:50.720
I don't really know the truth.

39:50.721 --> 39:52.922
I was having some people over.

39:52.923 --> 39:54.624
Were you serving alcohol?

39:54.625 --> 39:56.426
Serving alcohol? No.

39:56.427 --> 39:58.895
I was not serving alcohol.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.697
There's alcohol everywhere.

40:00.698 --> 40:02.899
I mean, if people brought
alcohol, I don't know.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.635
I'm not... the poli.. Whatever.

40:05.636 --> 40:07.804
I was having some people over.

40:07.805 --> 40:10.073
Word got out on social media

40:10.074 --> 40:12.976
and things got a
little outta control.

40:12.977 --> 40:15.011
A little outta control?

40:15.012 --> 40:18.081
A girl died in your driveway.

40:18.082 --> 40:20.083
Where are your parents?

40:20.084 --> 40:23.186
They were gone for the weekend,
but they're coming back now.

40:23.187 --> 40:28.024
Okay, you just tell me
everything you know.

40:28.025 --> 40:32.529
She was in my sister's
room, I think.

40:32.530 --> 40:35.098
I don't really know
what was going on.

40:35.099 --> 40:38.134
To be honest, I
barely knew the girl.

40:38.135 --> 40:40.471
Apparently, she was upset.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.174
I-I don't really know
why or what happened.

40:44.175 --> 40:48.078
Boy, you better give me
something better than that.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.854
The cops were all over me.

40:57.855 --> 40:59.457
They scar.

41:00.858 --> 41:03.861
- They let you go?
- Yeah, of course.

41:05.596 --> 41:07.064
Why wouldn't they?

41:08.699 --> 41:10.467
You think I had something
to do with it?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.937
No, no. I-I was.. I
didn't mean to imply...

41:13.938 --> 41:15.939
Yeah, you say that, but
how come it sounds

41:15.940 --> 41:18.174
like you don't believe me?

41:18.175 --> 41:20.510
I do believe you.

41:20.511 --> 41:22.879
I was just..

41:22.880 --> 41:24.949
I need to talk to you
about something else.

41:27.785 --> 41:30.688
Brittany showed me the
picture of you and Jordan.

41:36.927 --> 41:38.996
I don't know what to tell you.

41:47.638 --> 41:50.708
I've j.. I've just
been dealing..

41:55.045 --> 41:57.648
Jordan was my best friend.

42:00.651 --> 42:02.720
I don't know what to call it.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.057
I know what my dad
would call it, but..

42:08.826 --> 42:11.595
I had nothing to do with
that, with that photo.

42:18.002 --> 42:20.069
Why would I want Brittany to
find something like that anyway?

42:20.070 --> 42:22.139
I wouldn't want to hurt her.

42:24.308 --> 42:26.577
I can't believe she's dead.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.047
First Jordan, now Brittany.

42:46.230 --> 42:48.865
'First Jordan, now Brittany.'

42:48.866 --> 42:50.633
'What's happening?'

42:50.634 --> 42:53.269
It's like everything is
spinning out of control.

42:53.270 --> 42:56.005
Yeah, I know. Everything's
been pretty crazy.

42:56.006 --> 42:58.575
Yeah. Are you okay?

42:58.576 --> 43:00.311
'I've been better.'

43:01.979 --> 43:04.881
So, we should talk.

43:04.882 --> 43:07.016
- What about?
- 'Nate.'

43:07.017 --> 43:09.185
What about him?

43:09.186 --> 43:12.322
He told me he had a
crush on me yesterday.

43:12.323 --> 43:15.024
'I told Nate he had
to talk to you.'

43:15.025 --> 43:16.826
He had to be honest.

43:16.827 --> 43:20.129
'Whatever, Sam. I don't
care, he's yours.'

43:20.130 --> 43:21.698
Well, but this is
not how I want...

43:21.699 --> 43:23.766
This is how stuff goes, okay?

43:23.767 --> 43:26.002
Some people win,
other people lose.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.072
It's a long game.
I'll get over it.

43:31.041 --> 43:32.875
I'm so sorry.

43:32.876 --> 43:34.077
This sucks.

43:34.078 --> 43:36.813
Yeah, sure does.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.882
But it is what it is.

43:41.819 --> 43:45.088
- So, are we still friends?
- 'Of course.'

43:45.089 --> 43:47.224
You just have to give me
a minute to get over it.

44:36.140 --> 44:38.208
'You wanna tell me
what happened?'

44:40.911 --> 44:43.046
I don't really know.

44:43.047 --> 44:46.416
Um, I was just trying
to help a friend.

44:46.417 --> 44:49.385
Turns out her boyfriend was..

44:49.386 --> 44:51.989
Well, I don't, I don't really
wanna get into it all.

44:53.157 --> 44:55.225
Was he cheating on her?

44:56.160 --> 44:58.094
With another guy.

44:58.095 --> 44:59.329
Oh.

45:01.398 --> 45:04.034
- Who?
- Do you know Lance Hobart?

45:05.736 --> 45:08.071
The basketball player?

45:08.072 --> 45:12.376
Apparently, he was in love
with Jordan Reynolds.

45:13.444 --> 45:16.012
That's tough.

45:16.013 --> 45:21.350
Yeah, so Brittany
found out about it

45:21.351 --> 45:23.821
and I was just trying
to help her out.

45:25.022 --> 45:26.290
Honey..

45:28.325 --> 45:31.094
Were you with Brittany
when she fell?

45:31.095 --> 45:32.396
No.

45:33.831 --> 45:36.866
I was downstairs
talking to Rudy.

45:36.867 --> 45:39.236
- Were you drinking?
- Mom.

45:43.207 --> 45:45.241
Was Brittany?

45:45.242 --> 45:46.844
I don't know.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.182
She fell out of the window.

45:54.051 --> 45:57.820
And you're sure she fell?

45:57.821 --> 45:59.223
Yeah.

46:06.396 --> 46:08.866
I know that what
I'm about to say..

46:10.334 --> 46:12.870
Is hard to hear.

46:14.938 --> 46:18.242
Do you think that there's any
chance that she could've jumped?

46:20.144 --> 46:21.979
I don't know.

46:23.213 --> 46:25.482
Oh, sweetie. Come here.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.989
I'm so sorry.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.012
This is unbelievable.

46:56.013 --> 46:58.014
Two deaths in less than a month.

46:58.015 --> 47:01.350
It's more than I've
had in 19 years.

47:01.351 --> 47:03.085
'We've got to get
ahead of this.'

47:03.086 --> 47:05.822
Well, I've reached out to Mr.
Gomez and Mr. Reynolds

47:05.823 --> 47:07.957
and they're both coming
in for counseling.

47:07.958 --> 47:10.493
That's not the problem, Emily.

47:10.494 --> 47:12.528
These donor parents are
not going to be happy

47:12.529 --> 47:14.030
with another incident.

47:14.031 --> 47:17.033
Especially if it's a suicide.

47:17.034 --> 47:18.568
We've gotta, uh, we've
gotta call them.

47:18.569 --> 47:20.536
We've gotta reassure them
that, that, that, that

47:20.537 --> 47:22.171
that it was an accident.

47:22.172 --> 47:23.940
But-but we don't know that it...

47:23.941 --> 47:26.275
That it was an isolated incident

47:26.276 --> 47:27.944
and that we are
looking into every...

47:27.945 --> 47:31.615
But we don't know that
it was an accident.

47:35.519 --> 47:38.188
Not knowing is not gonna
fly with these parents.

47:39.923 --> 47:42.258
Oh, God, it's probably
been blasted out

47:42.259 --> 47:43.894
on every social
media site by now.

47:46.196 --> 47:47.931
Oh, crap.

47:50.367 --> 47:51.635
Hello.

47:53.103 --> 47:56.005
No, I have no comment.

47:56.006 --> 47:59.042
We will let you know when we
have more information to share.

48:01.645 --> 48:03.914
My sixth call since 5:30.

48:56.934 --> 48:58.335
Nate?

48:59.503 --> 49:01.038
Nate?

49:03.540 --> 49:05.709
Are you messing with me?

49:41.244 --> 49:43.112
Wow. Don't usually have that
kind of effect on women.

49:43.113 --> 49:45.214
This isn't funny. You
scared the hell out of me.

49:45.215 --> 49:47.516
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

49:47.517 --> 49:49.218
No. Where were you?

49:49.219 --> 49:50.753
You said you were gonna
be in the old shop.

49:50.754 --> 49:53.155
I know. I got held up
for class by Perkins.

49:53.156 --> 49:55.624
Well, I'm pretty sure
somebody's following me.

49:55.625 --> 49:57.226
Somebody's following you?
Really?

49:57.227 --> 49:58.661
Definitely.

49:58.662 --> 50:01.297
I know someone was with
me in the old shop.

50:01.298 --> 50:03.232
This is just too creepy.

50:03.233 --> 50:05.434
It feels like just yesterday,
everything was great.

50:05.435 --> 50:08.204
Now, all of a sudden, my
best friend hates my guts

50:08.205 --> 50:11.774
and it seems like the school
is haunted by a serial killer.

50:11.775 --> 50:13.576
So, what are we gonna do?

50:13.577 --> 50:16.679
I just can't stop
thinking about Jordan.

50:16.680 --> 50:20.483
How the hell did he get
exposed to freakin' peanuts?

50:20.484 --> 50:23.619
You said it before, we
were all so careful.

50:23.620 --> 50:26.422
Wait a minute. What was the last
thing that touched his lips?

50:26.423 --> 50:28.190
The poison?

50:28.191 --> 50:30.359
Yeah, but the poison was water.
We know it was tested.

50:30.360 --> 50:32.428
What else?

50:32.429 --> 50:34.131
Angela's lips.

50:45.542 --> 50:48.210
So, I'm flattered that
you wanna interview me

50:48.211 --> 50:50.813
but isn't the "Squad Goal"
thing just for seniors?

50:50.814 --> 50:53.215
Well, we're actually
planning on doing a segment

50:53.216 --> 50:55.584
called "Squads In The Making."
So, we thought of you.

50:55.585 --> 50:57.787
Okay, cool.

50:57.788 --> 51:00.356
So, what do you
wanna talk about?

51:00.357 --> 51:02.158
Well, you've been
the stage manager

51:02.159 --> 51:03.692
for all the school
plays this year?

51:03.693 --> 51:06.162
- Uh-huh.
- That's pretty impressive.

51:06.163 --> 51:08.397
Don't they usually give
that job to a senior?

51:08.398 --> 51:11.835
I don't know if it's impressive,
but, I guess they like my work.

51:13.336 --> 51:16.306
- Can I get a tour?
- Sure.

51:17.741 --> 51:19.775
Yeah, so, check this out.

51:19.776 --> 51:21.410
What show are you
guys doing next?

51:21.411 --> 51:23.746
- We get to do "Hamilton."
- Really?

51:23.747 --> 51:25.714
Yeah. It's so exciting.
Oh, my gosh.

51:25.715 --> 51:27.817
You have to check out
this jacket we made.

51:27.818 --> 51:30.386
- Wait, you guys made that?
- Yeah.

51:30.387 --> 51:33.122
- 'Oh, my God!'
- 'Doesn't it look so vintage?'

51:33.123 --> 51:34.390
- Yeah, I love the buttons.
- Right?

51:34.391 --> 51:36.193
Thank you. We found
a button store.

51:37.561 --> 51:40.596
Um, is that the "Romeo
And Juliet" stuff?

51:40.597 --> 51:44.366
Yeah, well, whatever wasn't
taken evidence is still there.

51:44.367 --> 51:47.636
Well, I mean, I guess you don't
really need the masks, right?

51:47.637 --> 51:51.307
- 'Hey, you can pull that off.'
- Thank you, it's my new look.

51:51.308 --> 51:53.576
'And this is Juliet's, right?'

51:53.577 --> 51:56.579
Yeah, Angela. Such
a piece of work.

51:56.580 --> 51:58.448
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:00.684 --> 52:02.118
Sorry.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.752
- It's cool.
- 'I'm such a klutz.'

52:03.753 --> 52:05.788
'It happens, like, all
the time, actually.'

52:05.789 --> 52:07.557
- 'Really?'
- 'Yeah.'

52:11.761 --> 52:15.264
Oh, uh, you know what? I am
actually running so late.

52:15.265 --> 52:16.899
It's okay, don't worry about it.

52:16.900 --> 52:18.134
'Can we finish this later?'

52:18.135 --> 52:19.401
Yeah, you know where to find me.

52:19.402 --> 52:20.670
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:21.638 --> 52:23.340
- Hey.
- Hello.

52:31.548 --> 52:34.850
Hey. How's everything
going at home?

52:34.851 --> 52:38.220
Well, aside from my
folks being called home

52:38.221 --> 52:39.788
from a romantic weekend getaway

52:39.789 --> 52:41.624
'because there was a dead
body in the driveway..'

52:41.625 --> 52:44.560
And, oh, did I mention that
not one but two of my dad's

52:44.561 --> 52:46.729
cherished antique knives
were stolen from his office

52:46.730 --> 52:49.398
the office that I told you
to not let anybody into..

52:49.399 --> 52:50.799
Well, aside from that,
I guess you could say

52:50.800 --> 52:53.170
that everything is just
hunky-dory, thank you.

52:54.704 --> 52:56.172
How long do you think it'll take

52:56.173 --> 52:57.908
to get the results
from the lipstick?

52:59.276 --> 53:00.509
Seriously, dude?

53:00.510 --> 53:03.479
Hey, that sucks.

53:03.480 --> 53:05.681
Yeah, I'm grounded for
a freakin' month.

53:05.682 --> 53:07.650
Sorry, man.

53:07.651 --> 53:10.753
Um, did the police ever follow
up with you or anything?

53:10.754 --> 53:14.356
I mean, what can they say?
I-I, I didn't break any laws.

53:14.357 --> 53:17.393
You were with me when she fell
and even the cops said that

53:17.394 --> 53:20.596
I can't control what anyone
brings in or does to the house.

53:20.597 --> 53:23.399
So, at least that's
under control.

53:23.400 --> 53:25.635
Hey, well, at least there's
something positive.

53:26.903 --> 53:29.738
Yeah, alright.
Let's get to this.

53:29.739 --> 53:33.242
Anybody else getting like a
"Nancy Drew's" mystery vibe?

53:33.243 --> 53:35.312
'Here? Now? Okay, well..'

53:36.813 --> 53:41.885
Start off with five milliliters
of distilled water.

53:45.222 --> 53:51.527
Alright, then add three drops
of buffer concentrate.

53:51.528 --> 53:54.431
'One, two, three.'

53:57.534 --> 54:00.737
Add that to a test tube.

54:04.574 --> 54:05.842
Alright.

54:07.344 --> 54:10.680
Then, we swab the lipstick.

54:14.951 --> 54:16.519
'Hm.'

54:20.490 --> 54:21.992
Shake well.

54:23.927 --> 54:26.763
Okay. Add a test strip.

54:29.532 --> 54:33.636
And in just a second, we will
find out if you are pregnant.

54:33.637 --> 54:36.773
- You're hilarious.
- Chill, Sam, I got this.

54:39.042 --> 54:41.978
Voila, positive for
peanut residue.

54:43.613 --> 54:46.482
- Who the hell did this?
- Do you think Angela did this?

54:46.483 --> 54:49.051
- Oh, no way.
- I mean, she's pretty horrible.

54:49.052 --> 54:50.719
Yeah, but she's not a murderer.

54:50.720 --> 54:52.821
Look, I'm not saying she
intentionally killed him.

54:52.822 --> 54:54.590
Maybe somebody else
messed with her lipstick

54:54.591 --> 54:55.991
knowing Jordan was
gonna kiss her?

54:55.992 --> 54:58.594
Well, and there's no way
she needed the money.

54:58.595 --> 55:00.696
I'm like 99 percent certain

55:00.697 --> 55:03.900
but she was the one with
peanut oil on her lips.

55:05.001 --> 55:07.370
Let's go talk to her.

55:09.773 --> 55:12.042
Yeah, I'll just clean all this up.
Thanks, guys.

55:18.381 --> 55:20.917
Don't tell anyone I
came in here, okay?

55:23.386 --> 55:26.755
Doctor-patient confidentiality.

55:26.756 --> 55:29.058
I promise.

55:29.059 --> 55:31.560
'So how are you?'

55:31.561 --> 55:36.098
On a scale of one to ten, one.

55:36.099 --> 55:38.001
One being horrible.

55:39.402 --> 55:41.870
That's not surprising.

55:41.871 --> 55:44.441
You've been through
a real trauma.

55:45.575 --> 55:48.777
Yeah. Grounded forever.

55:48.778 --> 55:51.080
My parents won't
even talk to me.

55:51.081 --> 55:53.749
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

55:53.750 --> 55:56.086
You should be feeling
their support right now.

55:57.754 --> 56:00.989
Yeah, well, that kind
of went out the window

56:00.990 --> 56:04.927
when Brittany died falling
out their window.

56:04.928 --> 56:08.697
Plus, my dad seems more upset
about his knives being stolen

56:08.698 --> 56:10.999
than the fact that there's
an active serial killer

56:11.000 --> 56:13.035
loose in his son's high school.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.803
Well, we don't know
that for certain.

56:14.804 --> 56:17.439
Let's just try to
stick with the facts

56:17.440 --> 56:19.742
in a rational way, okay?

56:19.743 --> 56:23.780
But, right now, I'm more
concerned about you..

56:25.482 --> 56:27.549
And your feelings of loss.

56:27.550 --> 56:29.518
Lost my freedom.

56:29.519 --> 56:32.654
For sure, that's
a major problem.

56:32.655 --> 56:35.058
Loss of your classmates.

56:36.960 --> 56:39.061
Typically, someone
in your position

56:39.062 --> 56:42.398
is feeling angry at the
person for leaving

56:42.399 --> 56:46.168
and simultaneously
feeling guilty

56:46.169 --> 56:48.170
'for surviving.'

56:48.171 --> 56:50.038
Yeah.

56:50.039 --> 56:53.075
I mean, if I hadn't
had that stupid party

56:53.076 --> 56:55.144
maybe Brittany would
still be alive.

56:55.145 --> 56:59.014
Rudy, it's very important

56:59.015 --> 57:02.918
that you don't blame
yourself for any of this.

57:02.919 --> 57:07.824
Nothing that you did caused
any of this to happen.

57:11.461 --> 57:13.897
Listen, I, I gotta get to class.

57:17.967 --> 57:19.502
Rudy?

57:22.806 --> 57:25.808
Please come back in
again soon, okay?

57:25.809 --> 57:29.145
You really do need a safe place
to work through all this.

57:31.114 --> 57:33.749
I will. For sure.

57:33.750 --> 57:35.051
Thanks.

57:44.160 --> 57:48.030
- What was that about?
- What was what all about?

57:48.031 --> 57:50.699
I just saw Rudy leaving
here looking pretty upset.

57:50.700 --> 57:53.635
Well, he came in for counseling.

57:53.636 --> 57:56.205
Did he say anything that
I should know about?

57:56.206 --> 57:58.941
What we talk about
is confidential.

57:58.942 --> 58:02.077
Of course, I just thought kids
were supposed to leave therapy

58:02.078 --> 58:04.513
feeling better.

58:04.514 --> 58:07.217
- Well, that depends.
- On the therapist?

58:08.117 --> 58:10.486
On what was discussed.

58:10.487 --> 58:12.855
Well, if it's relevant to what's
going on around here I...

58:12.856 --> 58:15.491
It wasn't.

58:15.492 --> 58:17.860
Rudy's in the middle of things.

58:17.861 --> 58:19.828
Right smack in the middle.

58:19.829 --> 58:22.898
And he's having a
difficult time.

58:22.899 --> 58:27.769
Sometimes a wound gets opened
and, uh, it's a process.

58:27.770 --> 58:30.038
I don't have time for
your process, Emily.

58:30.039 --> 58:31.607
I need to get to
the bottom of this

58:31.608 --> 58:32.875
before another tragedy happens

58:32.876 --> 58:35.211
and I expect you to cooperate.

58:37.547 --> 58:40.716
I'm doing exactly what I
was brought here to do.

58:40.717 --> 58:42.050
If you'd rather have
someone else...

58:42.051 --> 58:44.586
That's not what I'm saying.

58:44.587 --> 58:45.855
Okay.

58:47.857 --> 58:52.227
Well, then is there
anything else?

58:52.228 --> 58:55.164
I have to meet some kids
for a group session now.

58:56.733 --> 58:58.167
No.

59:01.771 --> 59:05.173
Look, Emily, I didn't mean to...

59:05.174 --> 59:07.676
I'm sure you didn't.

59:07.677 --> 59:10.679
This can be rough on everyone.

59:10.680 --> 59:13.815
- Bit of advice?
- Yeah.

59:13.816 --> 59:17.686
You may wanna look into getting
some therapy for yourself.

59:17.687 --> 59:19.889
It can really help.

59:32.769 --> 59:34.703
'I don't understand what
you're asking me that for.'

59:34.704 --> 59:37.072
I thought this was for
your "â™ªSquadGoal" blog?

59:37.073 --> 59:39.641
It is. We're putting
together a special

59:39.642 --> 59:42.044
in his memory tribute for
Jordan in the next post.

59:42.045 --> 59:45.280
Okay, it just sounded more
like you were suggesting

59:45.281 --> 59:46.982
I had something to
do with his death.

59:46.983 --> 59:49.618
I'm not. I'm just asking

59:49.619 --> 59:51.853
if you knew about the peanut
residue in your lipstick.

59:51.854 --> 59:53.622
I never used it before.
How would I know?

59:53.623 --> 59:54.823
It was our only dress rehearsal.

59:54.824 --> 59:56.325
Which, by the way,
is ridiculous.

59:56.326 --> 59:58.927
What kind of drama program
only has one dress?

59:58.928 --> 01:00:00.963
God, I can't wait to
get out of this pit.

01:00:00.964 --> 01:00:04.232
And by the way, what the hell
business is it of yours?

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.968
Whoa, take it easy, Angela.

01:00:05.969 --> 01:00:08.270
I can't believe I'm even
engaging with you geeks

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.806
right now, but let me
ask you something.

01:00:10.807 --> 01:00:13.241
Why on earth would I
have wanted anything bad

01:00:13.242 --> 01:00:14.943
to happen to Jordan?

01:00:14.944 --> 01:00:19.681
He's one of the few people that...
got this.

01:00:19.682 --> 01:00:21.084
He got me.

01:00:25.088 --> 01:00:27.155
Did you put in for
the scholarship?

01:00:27.156 --> 01:00:29.291
What, the World Patron's thing?

01:00:29.292 --> 01:00:31.393
Of course not, my family
is so not poor enough.

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:34.096
I'm truly sorry you're not poor.
My condolences.

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.766
Screw you, Nate. It's
time for my scene.

01:00:38.334 --> 01:00:41.104
'Just so you know, I didn't have
nearly enough time to prepare.'

01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:44.974
I hate her.

01:00:46.709 --> 01:00:48.745
But she didn't do it.

01:01:46.936 --> 01:01:49.071
- Did you hear?
- What?

01:01:49.072 --> 01:01:51.306
- Lance is transferring.
- Really?

01:01:51.307 --> 01:01:53.909
Yeah, I just saw him and
his dad in the office.

01:01:53.910 --> 01:01:56.378
- Wow!
- I know.

01:01:56.379 --> 01:01:59.081
What were you doing in
the office, by the way?

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:01.016
That is a very good
question, my friend.

01:02:01.017 --> 01:02:03.018
Do you know who
you're talking to?

01:02:03.019 --> 01:02:05.987
- Who?
- Captain Awesome.

01:02:05.988 --> 01:02:07.856
Okay.

01:02:07.857 --> 01:02:09.891
I just found out that I'm
the California AP Scholar

01:02:09.892 --> 01:02:11.860
of Math and Science.
They just told me.

01:02:11.861 --> 01:02:14.763
Captain Awesome, indeed.

01:02:14.764 --> 01:02:16.865
Well, not to be
crass or anything

01:02:16.866 --> 01:02:20.502
but the scholarship
list is now down to..

01:02:20.503 --> 01:02:23.872
- Me, you, and Nate.
- Yeah.

01:02:23.873 --> 01:02:25.307
But I'll tell you what.

01:02:25.308 --> 01:02:27.109
That whole California
Scholar thing

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:29.912
that could put you
over the top, man.

01:02:32.982 --> 01:02:35.784
It's my dad. I'm
still in lockdown.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.186
Good luck with that.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:40.022
Hey, dad. Guess what?

01:02:45.361 --> 01:02:47.028
'Hi, mom.'

01:02:47.029 --> 01:02:48.765
In the kitchen.

01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.035
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:58.106
So, when were you gonna tell me?

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.275
About?

01:03:00.276 --> 01:03:02.477
About Nate.

01:03:02.478 --> 01:03:05.313
I'm at your school.

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:07.048
I hear things.

01:03:07.049 --> 01:03:09.518
He is cute, right?

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:13.021
And he's smart. Like
scary smart, actually.

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:17.926
- Well, that's good.
- Yeah, and he's really funny.

01:03:17.927 --> 01:03:20.428
But also kind of dark and weird.

01:03:20.429 --> 01:03:22.898
Quirky.

01:03:22.899 --> 01:03:25.134
- I like that.
- Me too.

01:03:28.204 --> 01:03:31.174
- Go slow.
- Okay, mom.

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:36.178
And, uh, Nate's actually on
the scholarship list, too

01:03:36.179 --> 01:03:37.946
but, he says he's
not gonna get it

01:03:37.947 --> 01:03:39.916
because he's pissed
too many people off.

01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.552
You know, speaking
of the scholarship..

01:03:43.553 --> 01:03:45.453
What?

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:48.123
Don't you think it's a little
more than coincidental

01:03:48.124 --> 01:03:51.426
that most of the people on it
are either now off the list

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.896
or you know, dead?

01:03:55.464 --> 01:03:59.902
Well, you're still only talking
about two or three people.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:04.439
Statistically, that's
a small sample set.

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:07.509
So, we tested the lipstick

01:04:07.510 --> 01:04:09.878
Angela Dodds used in the play.

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:13.448
You tested the lipstick?

01:04:13.449 --> 01:04:15.217
For what?

01:04:15.218 --> 01:04:17.018
And who is we?

01:04:17.019 --> 01:04:18.520
Me, Nate, and Rudy.

01:04:18.521 --> 01:04:23.258
Anyway, it came out positive
for peanut residue.

01:04:23.259 --> 01:04:25.293
Angela said she didn't
know anything about it

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:27.195
'and I think she's
telling the truth.'

01:04:27.196 --> 01:04:30.031
This is not a game, Samantha.

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.934
This is as serious as it gets.

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:35.270
That's why we're
doing all of this.

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:36.605
But you are not a detective.

01:04:36.606 --> 01:04:38.173
If anything, you're interfering

01:04:38.174 --> 01:04:40.308
with the police investigation.

01:04:40.309 --> 01:04:42.377
What investigation?

01:04:42.378 --> 01:04:45.982
Nobody's asking any questions.
Nobody's doing anything.

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:51.287
Stop. This is not your job.

01:04:52.655 --> 01:04:56.391
Your job is to get good grades

01:04:56.392 --> 01:05:00.328
and get out of high school
with a perfect resume.

01:05:00.329 --> 01:05:01.931
Period.

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:07.168
You don't have to be a
full-blown adult yet.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:10.138
Trust me, it's overrated.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:13.208
Anyway, how did you
even test the lipstick?

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:17.113
They have allergy testing
kits in the science lab.

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.284
Well, still, it doesn't
prove anything.

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.487
We don't know how it got there.

01:05:26.255 --> 01:05:27.657
It is strange though.

01:05:29.191 --> 01:05:31.026
'I'll reach out
to the detective'

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:34.262
they assigned to the case
from the school, okay?

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.665
Thanks, mom.

01:05:39.335 --> 01:05:42.138
Speaking of you getting
out of high school..

01:05:45.174 --> 01:05:48.044
I have something for you..

01:05:49.378 --> 01:05:51.613
And I think you're
gonna like it.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:54.316
- It's thick.
- 'Yes, it is.'

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:57.218
- Did you open it?
- Damn right I did.

01:05:57.219 --> 01:06:00.255
- Did I get in?
- Yes, you did!

01:06:00.256 --> 01:06:01.424
Oh!

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:08.063
- I'm so proud of you, honey.
- Thanks, mom.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:10.131
Not that I know how
we're gonna afford it.

01:06:10.132 --> 01:06:11.533
Oh!

01:06:11.534 --> 01:06:14.069
Honey, scholarships

01:06:14.070 --> 01:06:18.306
and loans and part-time jobs.

01:06:18.307 --> 01:06:20.476
Where there's a will,
there's a way.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:26.749
Congratulations.

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:44.366
- Tell me.
- What?

01:06:44.367 --> 01:06:45.600
- You got in?
- Yeah.

01:06:45.601 --> 01:06:48.204
- I got in!
- 'Shh!'

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.272
Girlfriend!

01:06:51.273 --> 01:06:55.043
It's so awesome. I'm not sure
if we can swing it though.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:56.444
It's gonna put me in major debt.

01:06:56.445 --> 01:07:00.081
You'll figure it out.
I'm so happy for you.

01:07:00.082 --> 01:07:03.184
- So, we're good?
- I'm fine.

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:05.320
- I was just being a jerk.
- No, I totally get it...

01:07:05.321 --> 01:07:07.122
You don't even go there,
I thought about it

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:09.290
and there is no way
I'm letting a guy

01:07:09.291 --> 01:07:10.759
come between me and
my best friend.

01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:12.527
We gotta go on Roommate Finder.

01:07:12.528 --> 01:07:14.462
Dude, you gotta fill up that
questionnaire right away

01:07:14.463 --> 01:07:16.031
or you'll end up
with some psycho.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:17.199
'Right.'

01:07:21.237 --> 01:07:23.271
- What?
- Oh, nothing.

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:26.341
- It's just crazy.
- Just tell me.

01:07:26.342 --> 01:07:28.576
I guess I'm thinking
about that photograph.

01:07:28.577 --> 01:07:31.546
- Of Lance and Jordan?
- Yeah.

01:07:31.547 --> 01:07:34.516
I don't know, that whole
thing is just too weird.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.317
What are you talking about?

01:07:36.318 --> 01:07:37.719
'Nate took that shot of Jordan.'

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.422
'I saw it when I was
on his computer.'

01:07:41.123 --> 01:07:43.558
And the shot magically
appears on Jordan's locker.

01:07:43.559 --> 01:07:45.260
What, so you're saying you think

01:07:45.261 --> 01:07:47.328
Nate had something
to do with that?

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:50.532
Sam, next to you,
he's my best friend.

01:07:50.533 --> 01:07:55.336
I've known him longest, but,
lately he's been acting weird.

01:07:55.337 --> 01:07:58.273
And not like quirky
weird but weird, weird.

01:07:58.274 --> 01:08:00.275
- Come on, Gillian...
- 'Bitter and sarcastic... '

01:08:00.276 --> 01:08:01.643
Gillian.

01:08:01.644 --> 01:08:03.545
What did Ms. Desai
say in Psy class?

01:08:03.546 --> 01:08:06.648
That sarcasm is really
hostility disguised as humor.

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:08.216
Sure, but...

01:08:08.217 --> 01:08:11.352
'Okay, and think about
who's, well, gone.'

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.188
- Okay.
- 'Jordan.'

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.490
Nate hated Jordan because he
thought he was full of crap.

01:08:15.491 --> 01:08:19.227
Brittany, he hated all of her
cutesy-wootsy cheerleader crap.

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:22.430
- Look, he didn't hate Lance.
- No?

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:24.765
I keep forgetting you've
only been here a few months.

01:08:24.767 --> 01:08:26.701
Did you know that Lance and
Nate used to be super close

01:08:26.702 --> 01:08:28.236
not too long ago?

01:08:28.237 --> 01:08:29.871
- No.
- They were.

01:08:29.872 --> 01:08:31.573
But then high school started

01:08:31.573 --> 01:08:34.209
and they started to hang
out with different crowds.

01:08:34.210 --> 01:08:36.511
Lance chose to be with the
beautiful people and the jocks

01:08:36.511 --> 01:08:40.180
and Nate, he chose us.

01:08:40.182 --> 01:08:43.551
So, yeah, there's some issues
between Nate and Lance.

01:08:43.551 --> 01:08:45.153
He thought he was a
fair-weather friend.

01:08:45.154 --> 01:08:47.421
Not to mention a liar.

01:08:47.423 --> 01:08:50.325
This is too much, Gillian.
No way.

01:08:50.326 --> 01:08:52.460
I didn't wanna believe
it either, Sam.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.696
And you guys have this
thing going on now and..

01:08:54.697 --> 01:08:56.731
What, are you gonna say
he hated Rudy too?

01:08:56.732 --> 01:09:00.268
'Nate would never have let him
get in trouble for that party.'

01:09:00.269 --> 01:09:02.871
They're like brothers.

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.906
Whoever said it was about hate?

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.276
Maybe it's just about
doing what you gotta do.

01:09:15.584 --> 01:09:18.353
Oh, can you wait outside
for just a minute

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:20.756
and I'll come get you when we're done?
Thank you.

01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:27.228
So we have an issue.

01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:29.430
- Two actually.
- What?

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:30.865
'Well, number one'

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:34.502
the autopsy just came
back on Brittany Gomez.

01:09:34.502 --> 01:09:36.904
'She didn't die from the fall.'

01:09:36.906 --> 01:09:38.473
Took them a while to find it

01:09:38.474 --> 01:09:41.242
but she actually died
from a stab wound.

01:09:41.243 --> 01:09:42.510
Oh, my God!

01:09:42.511 --> 01:09:44.645
Then I just got an
anonymous email

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:46.548
that one of our students
is dealing narcotics

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:47.749
out of his locker.

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.250
I showed IT and they said

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:50.952
it came from an
untraceable address.

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:52.421
Read it for yourself.

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.829
- No way.
- What the hell is going on?

01:10:01.830 --> 01:10:03.966
I'm losing control of my school.

01:10:20.616 --> 01:10:23.318
Oh, my God.

01:10:23.319 --> 01:10:25.687
What is it?

01:10:25.688 --> 01:10:28.290
Excuse me. What are you
doing in my locker?

01:10:45.407 --> 01:10:47.642
- Did you hear?
- Who died now?

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:50.912
- Lance. Kind of.
- I heard about that.

01:10:50.913 --> 01:10:53.514
- It's horrible.
- No kidding.

01:10:53.515 --> 01:10:56.017
I heard they're sending
him to military school.

01:10:56.018 --> 01:10:59.954
- Poor Lance.
- Oh, hey, question.

01:10:59.955 --> 01:11:02.290
How do you know Nate
took this picture?

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.725
What do you mean?

01:11:03.726 --> 01:11:05.793
Are you sure it was
downloaded from his camera?

01:11:05.794 --> 01:11:07.528
I'm photo editor for
"Squad Goal," Sam.

01:11:07.529 --> 01:11:10.833
- I download all of his stuff.
- Oh. Right, sorry.

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.769
Did you guys hear?

01:11:14.770 --> 01:11:17.372
About Lance? Yeah,
it's horrible.

01:11:17.373 --> 01:11:19.441
No, not Lance. I'm
talking about Rudy.

01:11:20.776 --> 01:11:22.377
What about Rudy?

01:11:22.378 --> 01:11:23.811
Apparently, they
discovered in the autopsy

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.513
that Brittany was stabbed
before she fell.

01:11:25.514 --> 01:11:27.882
- Are you kidding?
- No.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.450
They found a knife
in Rudy's locker.

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.685
Supposedly, it matched the one

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.320
that Brittany was stabbed with.

01:11:32.321 --> 01:11:34.423
- What?
- We better go.

01:11:49.838 --> 01:11:51.907
'Watch your head.'

01:11:54.977 --> 01:11:56.577
What do you think you're doing?

01:11:56.578 --> 01:11:58.646
I'm taking pictures
for the school paper.

01:11:58.647 --> 01:12:00.982
No, no more pictures. Get
yourself back to class.

01:12:00.983 --> 01:12:02.383
That goes for you guys too.

01:12:02.384 --> 01:12:04.652
- Yes, ma'am.
- I have a free.

01:12:04.653 --> 01:12:07.455
Well, then just get yourself back inside.
The show's over.

01:12:07.456 --> 01:12:09.557
And if those pictures see
the light of day anywhere

01:12:09.558 --> 01:12:12.093
you're gonna be in a
cell next to your buddy.

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:13.761
Get back in class!

01:12:13.762 --> 01:12:15.864
All of you guys.
Get back to class.

01:12:18.801 --> 01:12:20.336
Hurry up!

01:12:33.716 --> 01:12:35.850
There's no way Rudy
brought in that knife.

01:12:35.851 --> 01:12:39.020
- Absolutely no way.
- He's so screwed now.

01:12:39.021 --> 01:12:40.988
Forget the scholarship,
that's over.

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:42.557
Even the schools
that accepted him

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:43.891
are gonna rescind their offer.

01:12:43.892 --> 01:12:45.593
Well, that's the least
of his problems.

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.695
He's gonna be charged
with a freakin' felony.

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:49.397
Unbelievable.

01:12:49.398 --> 01:12:50.732
Someone had to have set him up.

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:53.535
Oh, no doubt. Let's meet
back up after school.

01:12:55.904 --> 01:12:57.406
Nate.

01:12:58.707 --> 01:13:01.043
I know you took the photo
of Lance and Jordan.

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.912
What about it?

01:13:05.447 --> 01:13:07.482
Did you put it up
on Lance's locker?

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.517
No, I would never do
anything like that.

01:13:09.518 --> 01:13:10.752
Did you ever share
it with anyone?

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.086
- No.
- You swear?

01:13:12.087 --> 01:13:13.688
Positive. I separated it out.

01:13:13.689 --> 01:13:16.624
I know how sensitive that is.

01:13:16.625 --> 01:13:19.994
Okay. I gotta go.

01:13:19.995 --> 01:13:22.664
- Let's talk later.
- Okay.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:37.011
Listen, detective,
I am asking you

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:39.481
to please get back into this.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:45.154
Because there was peanut
residue on the lipstick.

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:48.990
Yes, I know that there was

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.859
because my daughter
is a smart girl.

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:53.862
A whole lot smarter than..

01:13:56.498 --> 01:13:58.433
Hmm.

01:13:58.434 --> 01:14:00.001
Now I know why these
kids have decided

01:14:00.002 --> 01:14:02.137
to take matters into
their own hands.

01:14:03.472 --> 01:14:04.840
Thank you.

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:50.117
- Sam?
- Hey.

01:14:50.118 --> 01:14:52.587
So you're gonna tell me? The
suspense is killing me.

01:14:52.588 --> 01:14:54.188
It's Nate.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:59.093
After everything you told me, I
realized it's got to be him.

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:02.964
Why would he keep taking
pictures of people dying?

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:05.500
And then he lied to me about
sharing that picture with you

01:15:05.501 --> 01:15:07.068
of Lance and Jordan.

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:08.970
And he has motive.

01:15:08.971 --> 01:15:11.840
He needs that scholarship
more than anyone else.

01:15:13.609 --> 01:15:15.276
And what's scariest..

01:15:15.277 --> 01:15:18.279
I'm the last one in line
for the scholarship.

01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:21.048
He gets rid of me, he's got it.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:24.052
So I need to make sure he's
busted before he can get to me.

01:15:27.789 --> 01:15:29.724
Sam, I love you.

01:15:29.725 --> 01:15:32.093
But you're kind of
stupid, you know.

01:15:32.094 --> 01:15:36.163
Frankly, I like the whole line
questioning about downloading.

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.999
But that was a lie.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.602
He had separated the
Lance-Jordan pic.

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.681
Enjoying my computer?

01:15:53.682 --> 01:15:55.283
Shared all the pics
for the paper.

01:15:55.284 --> 01:15:57.252
We're on deadline, Natie.

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.889
Gillian, what are you doing?

01:16:01.890 --> 01:16:05.560
You know, you probably
don't know this

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:07.129
but I used to call him Natie.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:11.232
See, I didn't just arrive
here six months ago

01:16:11.233 --> 01:16:14.002
'with this girl-next-door look
and sweep Nate off his feet.'

01:16:16.204 --> 01:16:19.607
I've known him almost
my entire life.

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:22.243
We went to
kindergarten together.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.012
Gillian, can we just
settle down for a sec?

01:16:25.013 --> 01:16:27.213
'It's a little late for that
now, Sam, don't you think?'

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:30.318
- Gillian.
- Gillian, Gillian.

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:33.054
Just shut up already!

01:16:33.055 --> 01:16:36.157
Your charm's getting old, Sam.

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:39.126
You're supposed to
be my best friend.

01:16:39.127 --> 01:16:40.228
I am.

01:16:41.897 --> 01:16:45.066
But best friends don't
hook up with the guys

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:47.636
'their best friends
are in love with.'

01:16:49.771 --> 01:16:54.275
When the person who has
known him their entire life

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:57.011
doesn't even get asked
to her own prom?

01:16:57.012 --> 01:17:00.082
- Gillian, I am your best...
- Wrong!

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:03.818
Nate is my best friend.

01:17:03.819 --> 01:17:05.287
And my soulmate!

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:10.057
Sure, let's just..

01:17:10.058 --> 01:17:13.260
Put down the knife so
we can talk about it.

01:17:13.261 --> 01:17:15.997
It's too late for
talking now, Sam.

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:18.899
It's time for action.

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:21.035
'Here's the thing.'

01:17:21.036 --> 01:17:26.274
Best friends do extra ordinary
things for each other.

01:18:06.248 --> 01:18:08.683
Jordan!

01:18:08.684 --> 01:18:10.851
Somebody, help me!

01:18:10.852 --> 01:18:13.020
You plant knives in the locker
of close friends just to help

01:18:13.021 --> 01:18:15.690
the love of your life get the
scholarship he deserved.

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.459
What are you doing in my locker?

01:18:21.730 --> 01:18:23.864
I kept one of the
knives for myself.

01:18:23.865 --> 01:18:26.100
Sure, I'm glad I did.

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.736
'Your reporting skills aren't
gonna help you today.'

01:18:28.737 --> 01:18:30.305
Gillian, please.

01:18:33.475 --> 01:18:35.243
Please what?

01:18:38.313 --> 01:18:40.247
Best friends do whatever
they have to do

01:18:40.248 --> 01:18:42.284
to help the person they love.

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.987
Whether it's blackmail..

01:18:47.923 --> 01:18:50.492
Or simply taking
care of business.

01:18:55.363 --> 01:18:57.832
Can I tell you something?

01:18:57.833 --> 01:18:59.800
My idea was just to
get Brittany wasted

01:18:59.801 --> 01:19:01.368
and make an anonymous
call to the police

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:03.238
that she was driving drunk.

01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:07.141
But you know what?

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:09.276
But when that entitled,
pretentious whore

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:12.046
just sat there whining
on the windowsill

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.149
after all she's been given..

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:23.090
Well, she just had to go.

01:19:23.091 --> 01:19:25.326
It's now just down to you, Sam.

01:19:25.327 --> 01:19:26.928
Last girl standing.

01:19:28.263 --> 01:19:31.165
'And that won't be for long.'

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:33.534
Thank you, Gillian.

01:19:33.535 --> 01:19:35.469
For what?

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.139
Confessing.

01:19:39.107 --> 01:19:41.443
Nate, you get all that?

01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:44.411
I got the whole thing.

01:19:44.412 --> 01:19:47.882
'Sorry, Gillian, you're cooked.'

01:19:47.883 --> 01:19:50.317
Really? You're gonna try to
continue and humiliate me

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:51.952
after all that
I've done for you?

01:19:51.953 --> 01:19:53.554
- 'Put the knife down.'
- You know what?

01:19:53.555 --> 01:19:55.123
You both have to go.

01:19:56.258 --> 01:19:57.958
- You're dead!
- Ah!

01:19:57.959 --> 01:19:58.994
Nate!

01:20:01.196 --> 01:20:02.330
Sam, watch out!

01:20:15.043 --> 01:20:16.945
That hurt, Nate.

01:20:19.581 --> 01:20:21.449
'Come on, Natie.'

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:30.324
No, no. No!

01:20:30.325 --> 01:20:32.294
'Natie, I loved you.'

01:20:39.467 --> 01:20:40.869
Hey.

01:20:42.204 --> 01:20:43.971
You okay?

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:46.341
Yeah. You?

01:20:47.242 --> 01:20:49.010
Yeah, I think so.

01:21:18.306 --> 01:21:22.009
A A few months ago when I
began writing "â™ªSquadGoals"

01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:23.878
I didn't know what
it would become.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:25.412
To be honest, I was
kind of hoping

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:26.947
it would be an
opportunity for me

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.049
to, well, be discovered.

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.085
But as it turned
out, I'm the one

01:21:31.086 --> 01:21:32.887
who got to do the discovering

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:35.055
in that I solved a
couple of murders

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:38.292
and won a couple of student
journalism awards.

01:21:38.293 --> 01:21:40.494
And to be honest, some of
the things I discovered

01:21:40.495 --> 01:21:42.229
were pretty ugly.

01:21:42.230 --> 01:21:45.332
And, some things
were pretty amazing.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:47.935
I am thrilled to
announce the winner

01:21:47.936 --> 01:21:50.605
of the World Patron
Scholars Award.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.575
Samantha Hodges.

01:22:04.085 --> 01:22:06.120
But it was all a
lesson in learning

01:22:06.121 --> 01:22:08.990
one that I hope to continue
in the next phase of my life.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:11.992
A phase that this scholarship

01:22:11.993 --> 01:22:14.361
which I've chosen
to split three ways

01:22:14.362 --> 01:22:17.631
will certainly make a whole
lot more manageable.

01:22:17.632 --> 01:22:19.633
Sure, a four-year ride
would have been nice

01:22:19.634 --> 01:22:22.603
but, the love and
friendship of my squad

01:22:22.604 --> 01:22:24.706
is a whole lot nicer.
