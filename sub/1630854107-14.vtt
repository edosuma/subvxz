WEBVTT

00:08.542 --> 00:10.044
<i>Ask a higher power</i>

00:10.144 --> 00:12.846
<i>why bad things happen
to good people.</i>

00:13.647 --> 00:16.150
<i>I'm pretty sure
you'd come up empty.</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.352
<i>What I can tell you
is that I've spent</i>

00:18.452 --> 00:20.354
<i>far too much time resenting you.</i>

00:20.454 --> 00:22.190
<i>Hating you.</i>

00:22.290 --> 00:25.393
<i>Dreaming of you lying
in a pool of your own blood.</i>

00:25.493 --> 00:27.495
<i>And this time</i>

00:27.595 --> 00:30.398
<i>I'd be the one
pulling the trigger.</i>

01:00.928 --> 01:03.431
So I run home
for lunch to try and save

01:03.531 --> 01:05.766
my extremely
temperamental orchids,

01:05.866 --> 01:08.702
and suddenly I get the feeling
that I'm-I'm being watched.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.305
And so I look up
and there she is,

01:11.405 --> 01:14.475
right above my greenhouse,
this ruby-throated hummingbird

01:14.575 --> 01:17.345
in all her amazingly
minuscule glory.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.247
Oh, it is amazing.

01:19.347 --> 01:20.681
It's an amazing shot
you got, too.

01:20.781 --> 01:22.550
Almost as amazing
as these bad boys right here.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.752
Mmm, nothing better
than afternoon pastries.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.154
What did you say
you call this again?

01:26.254 --> 01:27.588
Uh, Italian, sfogliatelle.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.723
Uh, not quite
on a par with Veniero's

01:29.823 --> 01:32.426
in, uh, Manhattan,
but they're pretty close.

01:32.526 --> 01:35.363
Hey, guys. Oh, cool hummingbird.
Right?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.198
Jimmy, you got to try this.
I could use one.

01:37.298 --> 01:39.233
If you like those,
you're gonna love tomorrow.

01:39.333 --> 01:42.536
I found a deli that makes
the best Peruvian picarones.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.772
Jimmy, you okay?

01:44.872 --> 01:47.475
What? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
I'm fine, fine.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.842
Yeah, just fine?

01:48.942 --> 01:50.844
Yeah, man, I know
that look. What's up?

01:50.944 --> 01:53.080
It's-it's nothing, really,
it's just...

01:53.181 --> 01:55.183
HR turned down my request
for an assistant.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.050
You know, Kasie, too.
It's-it's not a big deal.

01:57.151 --> 02:00.053
But didn't Kasie try out
two new assistants last week?

02:00.154 --> 02:01.722
She did.
Neither one of them worked out,

02:01.822 --> 02:03.224
which is why I'm thinking
maybe HR got cold feet?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.459
All right, hold on,
that's got to be a mistake.

02:05.559 --> 02:07.595
Yeah, after all,
Ducky had you for years.

02:07.695 --> 02:09.430
You've had no one. Exactly.

02:09.530 --> 02:10.731
You guys need some help.

02:10.831 --> 02:12.200
I shouldn't have
even brought it up.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.502
It's just, it's been so long
since I had a partner.

02:14.602 --> 02:16.103
Then let's bring it up
with Vance.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.571
Right now, like you and me?

02:17.671 --> 02:18.739
We can all go,
if it helps.

02:18.839 --> 02:20.341
It's not like we're busy
around here.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.975
Oh, no.
Oh, come on,
man, don't say that out loud.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.645
What? What? It's true.
It's a quiet day.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.714
It's an all-too-rare quiet day.

02:26.814 --> 02:29.082
Yeah, don't jinx it.
Okay, okay, fine, whatever.

02:29.183 --> 02:31.118
Come on, Jimmy.

02:31.219 --> 02:32.853
Let's go before I, uh, I jinx us

02:32.953 --> 02:34.455
into the crime
of the century, huh?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.956
<i>I see.</i>

02:36.056 --> 02:37.090
And how did that happen?

02:37.191 --> 02:38.259
Well, we're not sure... Huh.

02:38.359 --> 02:41.895
Yeah, uh,
I understand, kind of.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.998
Um... so just
get it figured out

02:45.098 --> 02:46.834
and get back to me.

02:46.934 --> 02:48.802
Okay, thanks.

02:48.902 --> 02:51.071
Am I in trouble?
Can we get Ms. Hines in here?

02:51.171 --> 02:53.341
She's off today, she's
at the forensics convention

02:53.441 --> 02:55.209
in Georgetown.
Is she in trouble?

02:55.309 --> 02:56.977
No one's in trouble, Dr. Palmer.

02:57.077 --> 02:59.480
I was just hoping not to have
to explain this more than once.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.749
Explain what?
I'm not entirely certain myself,

03:01.849 --> 03:04.685
but apparently due to a glitch
in our payroll system,

03:04.785 --> 03:08.589
the two assistants that
Ms. Hines tried out last week

03:08.689 --> 03:11.492
were somehow issued
severance packages.

03:11.592 --> 03:12.726
For one day's work?

03:12.826 --> 03:14.762
As I said, glitch in the system.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.665
A glitch that's gonna cost Jimmy
the assistant that he needs?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.333
Again, Agent Parker, it's
not a need.

03:19.433 --> 03:21.602
It's really, it's okay.
No, it's not okay, Jimmy.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.804
You and Kasie bust
your butts down there.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.706
I'm sure the director
sees that, too.

03:25.806 --> 03:27.308
It's just a temporary situation.

03:30.844 --> 03:33.281
We have a body on
Route 60 in Fairfax.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.183
Yeah, which the team will
definitely blame me for causing.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.488
We can discuss this with
Ms. Hines tomorrow, Doctor.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.155
Got it, Director, thanks.

03:47.661 --> 03:50.564
Ooh, sfogliatelle.
Love it.

03:53.267 --> 03:54.902
Yes, sir.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.070
Hey, no skid marks on the
highway from the truck.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.307
But a fresh set where
a second vehicle stopped.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.542
Truck was likely ambushed.

04:02.776 --> 04:04.211
Guy never saw it coming.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.779
Based on the location
of the wound,

04:05.879 --> 04:07.915
I'd say he was dead
before he hit the stump.

04:08.015 --> 04:11.485
All right, our victim is
Ensign Clyde Sims, 27.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.021
According to the Norfolk office,
he was assigned to transport

04:14.121 --> 04:16.657
classified cargo
to a secure facility in Reston.

04:16.757 --> 04:17.825
Cargo's not secure anymore.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.993
Must've been pretty valuable.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.495
It was.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.464
Three crates of
black market opioids,

04:23.564 --> 04:25.599
seized at sea by a
Navy patrol boat,

04:25.699 --> 04:27.701
with an estimated
street value of...

04:27.801 --> 04:29.337
Anyone?
Half a million?

04:29.437 --> 04:31.038
Three.
Million?

04:31.138 --> 04:34.007
Looks like our killer
left a few pills

04:34.107 --> 04:36.143
on the way out.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.349
A lot of money
for something so small.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.517
So small
yet so much trouble.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.486
McGEE:
It's got a logo on it.

04:45.586 --> 04:46.854
What is it, an "M"?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.822
McGEE:
Maybe a "W"?

04:48.922 --> 04:50.791
Or a three?
I don't know, Parker.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.192
What do you think
this looks like?

04:56.196 --> 04:57.831
Agent Parker?

05:04.372 --> 05:06.306
Parker!

05:09.843 --> 05:11.645
What the hell was that?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.949
I don't know,
but it can't be good.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.893
Parker's still not in?

05:25.993 --> 05:27.395
What, would you expect
him to be?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.129
Well, he has to
turn up eventually.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.631
I mean, no one just
disappears all night

05:30.731 --> 05:32.065
without returning a phone call.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.301
I went by his house last night
and this morning.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.936
It's like he dropped off
the face of the Earth.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.038
"Dropped"?
It's more like he ran.

05:38.138 --> 05:39.239
Right after we found those.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.442
McGEE:
Leaving us to figure it out.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.343
Yeah, starting
with, are those Ms

05:43.444 --> 05:44.978
or Es or threes?

05:45.078 --> 05:46.547
It's a "W."
Turns out

05:46.647 --> 05:48.849
these bootlegs were
quite popular ten years ago.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.250
Where'd they come from?

05:50.350 --> 05:51.351
Well, that's what I'm trying
to figure out.

05:51.452 --> 05:52.886
That's why I came here early.

05:52.986 --> 05:54.187
Yeah, let me give you a hint.

05:54.287 --> 05:55.656
The "W" is for Wills.
Clayton Wills.

05:55.756 --> 05:57.758
Where you been?
Never mind that. Just tell me

05:57.858 --> 05:59.727
we have some leads, or do
I have to do everything

05:59.827 --> 06:01.094
around here?
Hey, what happened?

06:01.194 --> 06:02.262
No Peruvian picarones?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.731
Hey, you think I'm joking?!

06:03.831 --> 06:05.032
Whoa.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.035
I think you need
to take a step back.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.237
Parker, take it easy.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.940
Yeah, just tell us
what's going on.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.842
No, you tell me.
When I'm done with Vance,

06:14.942 --> 06:17.044
I want a full update
on our dead ensign,

06:17.144 --> 06:18.846
the hijacked truck,
and anything

06:18.946 --> 06:20.814
you can find
on Clayton Wills.

06:20.914 --> 06:23.083
With a "W"!

06:23.183 --> 06:25.453
Vance is not up there.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.422
Where the hell is he?

06:29.189 --> 06:31.024
Really, Director?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.527
Severance packages for one day?

06:33.627 --> 06:36.129
That's correct, Ms. Hines, but
as I told Dr. Palmer yesterday,

06:36.229 --> 06:38.298
until HR can fix the glitch,

06:38.398 --> 06:40.400
there won't be
any new hires for a while.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.335
We've made it this far without
assistants, I'm sure we...

06:42.436 --> 06:44.505
Seriously? Are you really still

06:44.605 --> 06:46.607
going on about lab assistants,
Jimmy, or can I borrow

06:46.707 --> 06:48.542
the director for something
a little more pressing?

06:48.642 --> 06:49.777
I actually...

06:49.877 --> 06:51.144
Civil tones, Parker.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.646
I'll be civil.
I just need a few minutes,

06:52.746 --> 06:53.647
and it can't wait.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.282
Outside.

06:55.382 --> 06:58.385
Wait, hold on, hold on,
what about him? Anything?

06:58.486 --> 07:00.387
Well, cause of death...
I know cause of death!

07:00.488 --> 07:02.122
I saw it with my own eyes.
I'm not talking about him.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.657
I'm talking about the bullet.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.992
Anything on the bullet?

07:05.092 --> 07:07.127
It's still running
through ballistics.

07:07.227 --> 07:08.629
And I'm still pulling
other bullets

07:08.729 --> 07:10.363
from the truck
down in the evidence garage.

07:10.464 --> 07:11.965
Well, isn't the evidence garage

07:12.065 --> 07:13.701
where you should be right now?!

07:13.801 --> 07:15.536
Parker!

07:21.475 --> 07:23.611
Hey, first of all,
cool your damn jets.

07:23.711 --> 07:26.246
My jets are right
where they need to be, okay?

07:26.346 --> 07:27.748
Look, this guy
that we're after...

07:27.848 --> 07:29.416
What guy?
And where have you been?

07:29.517 --> 07:31.519
Trying to get in to
see a guy named Clayton Wills,

07:31.619 --> 07:33.420
but his lawyer insists
that I need to go through

07:33.521 --> 07:36.023
proper channels, which
apparently means I need you,

07:36.123 --> 07:37.658
Leon, in MTAC.

07:37.758 --> 07:40.460
Ah, proper channels.
That's how it works, doesn't it?

07:40.561 --> 07:42.129
With protocols
that don't include

07:42.229 --> 07:43.597
you running out on your team.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.465
I didn't run out!

07:50.738 --> 07:52.573
Okay.

07:52.673 --> 07:54.942
I get it, I lost it.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.610
Lost it or still losing it?

07:56.710 --> 07:59.079
Look, I have my reasons.

07:59.179 --> 08:02.015
Which I'd be happy
to explain on the way.

08:02.115 --> 08:03.951
But, uh, this creep's lawyer

08:04.051 --> 08:06.386
is expecting our call,
so shall we?

08:12.259 --> 08:14.194
Clayton Wills.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.429
Founder and CEO of WillsNet,

08:16.530 --> 08:18.732
"a crowd-funded start-up
tech venture,

08:18.832 --> 08:22.135
bringing you the latest in
cutting-edge computer hardware."

08:22.235 --> 08:23.571
I know this company.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.939
Delilah's got one of their,
uh, all-in-one chargers.

08:26.039 --> 08:29.610
What's a computer geek have
to do with bootleg opioids?

08:29.710 --> 08:31.278
Well, it says it
right here in his bio.

08:31.378 --> 08:33.413
He created WillsNet after
serving time in prison.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.348
"Which is why WillsNet
is proud to employ

08:35.448 --> 08:37.250
"parolees to help start over

08:37.350 --> 08:39.386
and lead more productive lives."

08:39.486 --> 08:41.454
I'll bet a box of picarones
that Parker was the one

08:41.555 --> 08:44.391
who put this guy away.
We working down there or not?!

08:45.525 --> 08:47.861
Keep digging!
You got it.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.563
Jefe.

08:50.430 --> 08:52.299
Who is that
lunatic up there?

08:52.399 --> 08:54.568
And what has he done
with Parker?
Well, obviously,

08:54.668 --> 08:56.970
this Clayton Wills guy
brings out the worst in him.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.607
The worst? That guy up there
is someone we don't even know.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.647
Gentlemen, I can assure
you both that Mr. Wills

09:06.747 --> 09:09.149
has left his unfortunate past
far behind him.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.751
We understand that, Ms. Haswell.

09:10.851 --> 09:12.385
If you did, Director,

09:12.485 --> 09:14.321
this call
would not be necessary.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.289
My client paid
his debt to society

09:16.389 --> 09:17.858
and now dedicates
his life to helping

09:17.958 --> 09:19.326
former inmates like himself.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.028
She's got
her lines down cold.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.764
People love a good redemption
story, Agent Parker.

09:23.864 --> 09:26.066
It's become a hallmark
for our company.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.935
Made us a darling
in the tech world.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.770
It's a hell of a cover,
I'll give you that.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.071
Parker.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.806
Let's avoid any
unnecessary legal action

09:32.906 --> 09:34.608
for harassment, shall we?

09:34.708 --> 09:37.878
When do I get to see your boss?

09:37.978 --> 09:39.980
I can't guarantee a time.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.050
But in good faith,
I'll happily advise Mr. Wills

09:43.150 --> 09:45.152
to cooperate
in any way that he can.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.854
Yeah, I'll believe it
when I see it.

09:46.954 --> 09:48.588
Good talk.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.824
Gentlemen.

09:51.625 --> 09:54.762
Really? We got the call
you wanted, threw it away?

09:54.862 --> 09:56.463
I want Wills himself,

09:56.563 --> 09:58.531
not his well-paid
spokesperson.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.267
Well, good luck getting it now.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.005
It's not a good time, Jer.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.774
I'm right in the middle of s...

10:06.874 --> 10:08.075
What?

10:08.175 --> 10:09.476
Here?

10:09.576 --> 10:10.978
Okay, have 'em take you

10:11.078 --> 10:13.046
to the evidence garage,
I'll meet you there.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.115
Stop.

10:15.215 --> 10:17.985
Who was that?
A friend, Leon.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.087
Like you.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.422
Thanks.
Hey!

10:23.390 --> 10:24.692
You want to thank me?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.461
Take a breath.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.302
Last bullet looks
just like the others.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.104
Five rounds total.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.706
Ballistics give you
anything?

10:38.806 --> 10:40.974
I was saving
my report for Parker,

10:41.074 --> 10:43.176
but, you know,
I'm happy to practice.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.813
Has anyone seen
Dr. Jekyll today?

10:45.913 --> 10:47.647
Uh, we are going
with Hurricane Hyde.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.349
Oh, yeah,
no kidding.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.151
What happened to him?

10:51.251 --> 10:52.619
Uh, take a number.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.321
Bullets?

10:54.421 --> 10:56.556
...30-caliber with striations

10:56.656 --> 10:59.326
that suggest it was fired
from a very old gun.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.494
Like, World War II era.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.864
Easy to score at gun shows
but hard to trace.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.967
And we know the Hurricane is
gonna want a drug report, too.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.635
And I will be ready
for him.

11:08.736 --> 11:11.538
These Ws are just cheap
oxycodone knockoffs

11:11.638 --> 11:13.640
relying on grains of
fentanyl for strength.

11:13.741 --> 11:15.375
So, between killing
our ensign and stealing

11:15.475 --> 11:17.010
fentanyl-laced pills...

11:17.110 --> 11:18.846
These guys are easy to hate.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.514
Ooh, brace yourselves.

11:21.614 --> 11:23.183
Oh.

11:23.283 --> 11:24.684
Hi. Evidence garage?

11:24.785 --> 11:26.353
Oh, this is it.
Can we help you?

11:26.453 --> 11:27.520
I just hung up
with Agent Parker.

11:27.620 --> 11:28.922
Supposed to meet
him down here.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.523
Oh, then he'll be here.

11:30.623 --> 11:32.860
Um, I'm Agent Knight,
and you are...?

11:32.960 --> 11:33.994
Jeremy Brighton?

11:35.128 --> 11:36.864
Yes. Hey. Do I know you?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.665
Hi. Uh, no, no.

11:38.766 --> 11:40.734
But my wife and I are,
like, huge fans

11:40.834 --> 11:42.669
of your books
and-and your podcast.

11:42.770 --> 11:44.805
Wow. Thank you so much,
Agent...?

11:44.905 --> 11:46.406
Uh, Tim. McGee.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.575
But just, you know,
Tim's good.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.911
Online parenting coach
for wheelchair users.

11:51.011 --> 11:53.180
It works miracles
with the twins.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.215
Ah, twins. Double the fun.

11:55.315 --> 11:56.516
And how do you know Parker?

11:56.616 --> 11:57.985
He was my last partner
at the Bureau.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.386
You were FBI?
Retired.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.154
And if you're his current team,

12:01.254 --> 12:02.923
you should know he was really

12:03.023 --> 12:04.524
singing your praises last night.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.659
Last night
he was with you?

12:06.760 --> 12:08.762
Oh, I couldn't get him
out of my house.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.965
Park's a dog with a bone when
it comes to Clayton Wills.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.533
You're one to talk.

12:13.633 --> 12:15.202
I'm not obsessed, pal.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.437
You worked that
case together?

12:18.338 --> 12:20.808
My last case, yep.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.412
They're family. You can say it.

12:26.513 --> 12:29.282
It's the case
that put me in this chair.

12:41.361 --> 12:43.563
Wills started out as just
a cocky street dealer,

12:43.663 --> 12:45.098
before his "W" brand

12:45.198 --> 12:46.633
started flooding the Northeast.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.068
Pharma opioids are bad enough.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.803
A cheap alternative's
hard to beat.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.105
Yeah, which made
his little empire faster

12:52.205 --> 12:54.407
than we could keep up with.
Made him more elusive, too.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.410
We were after him for years
before that last firefight

12:57.510 --> 13:00.280
with his crew, when we finally
took him down, however briefly.

13:00.380 --> 13:01.982
Yeah, he only
served four years.

13:02.082 --> 13:04.017
Supposed to be 20,
but that little weasel gave up

13:04.117 --> 13:05.685
a bunch of his friends,
got it down to six,

13:05.785 --> 13:07.220
and then he walked
on good behavior.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.289
Explains why seeing those Ws
again really set you off.

13:09.389 --> 13:12.292
Well, I wouldn't say that
it exactly "set me off."

13:12.392 --> 13:14.494
Oh, that's affirmative
on "set off," yeah.

13:14.594 --> 13:15.695
It kind of did. Okay.

13:15.795 --> 13:17.764
Okay, but it makes
me want to prove

13:17.865 --> 13:19.666
more than ever that
Wills's new "company"?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.434
It's nothing but a front.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.602
Yeah, but it's not.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.037
I mean,
fronts usually don't

13:24.137 --> 13:25.372
produce an actual product.

13:25.472 --> 13:27.140
And I do seem
to recall some bad guys

13:27.240 --> 13:28.675
successfully managing
to reinvent

13:28.775 --> 13:30.510
themselves as good guys.
Not this guy.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.314
Oh, um... you are Delilah's

13:34.414 --> 13:36.549
absolute favorite author,
and she would kill me

13:36.649 --> 13:37.885
if I didn't get
a quick selfie with you.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.052
Do you mind?
Oh... I'd be honored.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.653
Nice.
I'll take it.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.856
Heck, bring the family for
dinner sometime. Josie loves

13:42.956 --> 13:44.992
entertaining, my son's a bit
older than your twins,

13:45.092 --> 13:46.393
but he loves
little kids.

13:46.493 --> 13:49.596
Almost as much
as he loves his godfather.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.831
Oh.

13:51.932 --> 13:53.100
Godfather?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.667
Well...

13:54.767 --> 13:56.769
Eli's a good boy.

13:59.873 --> 14:01.474
Director, yes, sir?

14:01.574 --> 14:02.709
Is Parker with you?

14:02.809 --> 14:04.878
Yes.
How is he?

14:05.913 --> 14:08.815
Uh, he is, uh, better actually.

14:08.916 --> 14:11.318
Good. I just got a call
from the lawyer.

14:11.418 --> 14:14.687
Clayton Wills is awaiting
a visit from both of you.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.456
What, he's asking for me?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.758
No, I am, and I'm not asking.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.728
Hold a tight leash, McGee.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.698
Clayton Wills is waiting for us.

14:25.798 --> 14:27.634
Remember, Park.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.137
You don't need a grudge,
you need evidence.

14:30.237 --> 14:32.539
Yeah, whatever.
McGee, let's go.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.741
Good luck, Tim.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.478
Okay, Brighton,
what's the deal?

14:38.578 --> 14:40.213
Yeah, you're seem to be
the Parker Whisperer.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.215
What happened to the Parker
that we know and love?

14:42.315 --> 14:44.451
You mean the bird-watching,
beer-making,

14:44.551 --> 14:46.453
pastry-loving Parker?

14:46.553 --> 14:48.221
Yeah. Wait.

14:48.321 --> 14:49.722
"Beer-making"?

14:49.822 --> 14:51.658
Before he started distracting
himself with those...

14:51.758 --> 14:53.927
delightful obsessions,

14:54.027 --> 14:56.096
my old partner was just
an impulsive,

14:56.196 --> 14:58.298
foul-mouthed,
hot-headed son of a bitch.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.401
What changed him?
Me getting shot.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.339
Park had my six that night,
or was supposed to.

15:07.707 --> 15:10.243
So he feels responsible.
Mm-hmm, which made him
want to change

15:10.343 --> 15:12.879
his ways, but being stuck at
the Bureau made that impossible.

15:12.980 --> 15:15.248
Joining you guys?

15:15.348 --> 15:17.817
That allowed him
to embrace these hobbies

15:17.917 --> 15:19.619
and turn over a new leaf.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.421
<i>Hey!</i>

15:21.521 --> 15:24.791
<i>Afraid I only have
a few minutes here to talk.</i>

15:24.891 --> 15:27.060
Agent Parker and, uh...

15:27.160 --> 15:29.196
Agent McGee, is it?
Yeah.

15:29.296 --> 15:31.498
Well, this should only take
a few minutes, so...

15:35.135 --> 15:37.304
First of all, I, uh,

15:37.404 --> 15:39.206
let me say,
I was absolutely mortified

15:39.306 --> 15:42.409
when Rebecca told me about
those copycat Ws out there.

15:42.509 --> 15:43.977
Mimicking
my trademark?

15:44.077 --> 15:45.312
Former trademark, of course.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.580
I have a new one now,
as you can see.

15:47.680 --> 15:49.649
'Cause you're a changed man.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.884
I would hope we all are.

15:51.985 --> 15:53.920
I've decided life's
too short to hold animosity

15:54.021 --> 15:55.555
against you
and your old partner for, uh,

15:55.655 --> 15:57.590
for rightly putting me away.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.059
Hell, Parker,
without you,

15:59.159 --> 16:00.994
I-I wouldn't be here.

16:02.262 --> 16:03.796
In fact...

16:03.896 --> 16:05.565
please accept
my best seller.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.000
Hmm?

16:07.100 --> 16:10.137
Just to show there's
no hard feelings at all.

16:11.438 --> 16:14.074
Still greasy
after all these years.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.043
McGee?
Thank you.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.078
But, uh, actually,
I already have one.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.713
My, uh, my wife loves the
all-in-one features on this guy.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.082
You know,
the AllDone is

16:22.182 --> 16:24.117
really gonna revolutionize
the industry.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.820
Did you say "Alden"?

16:27.920 --> 16:29.889
Seriously?
What? No.

16:29.989 --> 16:32.192
The AllDone, as in a device

16:32.292 --> 16:33.826
that does it all.
AllDone. Get it?

16:33.926 --> 16:35.762
Are you messing with me?
"AllDone"?

16:35.862 --> 16:37.530
"Alden"?
You hear that, McGee?

16:37.630 --> 16:39.399
Okay, maybe you should
let me do the talking.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.068
Hey, y-you know what, I just,
I just thought of something.

16:41.168 --> 16:42.335
A way to prove to you, Parker,

16:42.435 --> 16:43.870
that we're
on the same side here.

16:43.970 --> 16:45.572
We're never gonna be
on the same side.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.341
Not even if I give you the name
and location of my old supplier?

16:50.110 --> 16:52.545
Benny knew my product
inside and out.

16:52.645 --> 16:54.947
If anyone is copying my "W,"
it'd be him.

16:55.048 --> 16:57.084
Benny who?
Do you have a last name?

16:57.184 --> 16:59.286
Ah, well,
we didn't do last names,

16:59.386 --> 17:01.521
but if he's still operating
out of his old place,

17:01.621 --> 17:03.156
you'd better go in hot.

17:03.256 --> 17:06.459
Benny works alone, but he,
uh, he really likes his guns.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.496
In fact, Parker, I think Benny
may have been the one who, uh,

17:09.596 --> 17:12.099
who paralyzed
your buddy Brighton.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.934
That was his name, right,
Brighton?

17:15.034 --> 17:17.404
You don't say his name.

17:17.504 --> 17:18.605
Ever.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.107
Sorry, I didn't mean
to touch a nerve.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.175
I just hope you're not blaming
yourself or anything.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.244
I mean, what happened
to Brighton was so tragic,

17:24.344 --> 17:26.313
and if he...
Don't say his name!
I will kill you!

17:26.413 --> 17:27.980
Parker, Parker, come on!
Come on...
I will kill you.

17:28.081 --> 17:29.682
You understand me?
You understand me?!
Parker, stop it.

17:29.782 --> 17:31.318
Gentlemen!

17:33.553 --> 17:35.188
It's time to go.

17:40.927 --> 17:44.197
The location's surrounded
by a bunch of boarded-up stores,

17:44.297 --> 17:46.032
so if you have
to shoot first,

17:46.133 --> 17:47.600
there's no bystanders
to worry about.

17:47.700 --> 17:49.169
Hey, Parker, you don't have
to get your hands dirty

17:49.269 --> 17:50.570
on this one.
Yeah, seriously.

17:50.670 --> 17:52.605
If it's just one guy,
we can handle him alone.

17:52.705 --> 17:53.806
Over my dead body.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.275
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.710
Nothing to fear on my end, Leon.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.878
Not anymore.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.012
You're benched.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.382
What?!

18:03.950 --> 18:05.185
No.

18:05.285 --> 18:07.086
Yes. After hearing
from Wills's lawyer,

18:07.187 --> 18:09.656
what do you expect?
I only wish I'd done it sooner.

18:09.756 --> 18:12.659
McGee?
Wills got under your skin
without even trying.

18:12.759 --> 18:14.761
If Benny is our guy,
we need him back alive.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.996
And you think I can't do that?

18:17.096 --> 18:19.599
I can keep my cool out there.

18:19.699 --> 18:23.403
Better you keep it in here.
So no shots fired, got it?

18:23.503 --> 18:24.971
Got it, Director.

18:25.071 --> 18:26.773
Don't worry, Parker.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.375
We'll get him.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.685
<i>Can't say I blame him.</i>

18:38.785 --> 18:40.653
How can Parker
not feel guilty?

18:40.753 --> 18:42.555
Yeah, I get it, but...

18:42.655 --> 18:44.424
But what?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.959
But putting on the badge
comes with risks.

18:47.059 --> 18:50.197
We can't blame ourselves
for everything that goes wrong.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.132
Moving on is part of the job.

18:53.233 --> 18:54.667
A part of the job
that's not so easy

18:54.767 --> 18:56.769
after you watch
your partner get hit.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.472
Especially when it was
your job to watch his back.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.140
Well, best thing we can do
for Parker is, uh,

19:01.241 --> 19:03.142
bring in this Benny guy.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.879
I got your six in there.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.249
Back at you.

19:16.456 --> 19:19.659
Pickle store, really?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.364
So much for Benny working alone.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.499
And it looks
like he's packing heat, too.

19:26.599 --> 19:28.468
You know, it's possible they
don't make pickles here.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.403
Ah, that's too bad, 'cause
who doesn't like a pickle?

19:30.503 --> 19:32.672
Hey, uh, we're here
to see, uh, Benny.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.341
Yeah, we can
just show ourselves in.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.475
You have an appointment?

19:35.575 --> 19:36.943
Oh, this'll only
take a minute.

19:37.043 --> 19:38.144
NCIS.

19:38.245 --> 19:40.580
You guys got a warrant?

19:41.548 --> 19:43.816
Of course we do, you sillypants.

19:43.916 --> 19:47.354
Do you have a permit to carry
that gun under that coat?

19:56.896 --> 19:58.798
We should call for backup.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.099
What's going on?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.801
If we don't go in now,

20:01.901 --> 20:04.337
we might lose him for good.

20:09.642 --> 20:10.910
You can't come in here!

20:11.010 --> 20:13.380
Who are you guys?

20:14.146 --> 20:15.315
NCIS.

20:15.415 --> 20:16.783
Drop your weapons!

20:16.883 --> 20:18.985
What do I pay you for? Shoot!

20:19.085 --> 20:20.620
Whoa-whoa-whoa! Please don't!

20:20.720 --> 20:23.290
No, we can't, Benny.
We'd hit Francis.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.458
Francis, really?
Fine, don't shoot.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.193
But instead of standing there,
take 'em out!

20:56.423 --> 20:57.990
Okay.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.293
Hey, just calm down now.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.329
Now that we got
those guys out of the way,

21:02.429 --> 21:04.063
I'm sure we can
talk this through.

21:04.163 --> 21:06.132
I'm sure we can.
So talk.

21:06.232 --> 21:07.934
You name it, I can help out.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.936
You supplying
for Wills?

21:10.036 --> 21:11.471
Clayton Wills?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.906
Why would I be working
for my competition?

21:24.751 --> 21:26.653
Who the hell raids
a pickle store?

21:26.753 --> 21:28.921
Three years I've been there,
not one customer.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.523
So who tipped you, huh?

21:30.623 --> 21:32.158
It was Clayton Wills.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.460
Who also says you're the one

21:33.560 --> 21:35.828
who shot that FBI
agent years ago.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.564
I wasn't even there that night!

21:37.664 --> 21:39.566
You know
what Clayton's doing, right?

21:39.666 --> 21:41.167
Having you take out
the competition.

21:41.267 --> 21:42.702
Free of charge.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.637
Oh, yeah, keep talking.

21:44.737 --> 21:45.638
Yep, Wills ratted him out,

21:45.738 --> 21:47.306
now hopefully

21:47.407 --> 21:48.608
Benny will return the favor.

21:48.708 --> 21:50.042
He better give us something.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.679
As of now,
we've got nothing on Wills.

21:52.779 --> 21:55.047
Okay, look,
there has to be something

21:55.147 --> 21:57.350
I can do for you guys
to help out.
How about

21:57.450 --> 22:00.019
you help yourself by
giving us something good?

22:00.119 --> 22:03.189
Like where Wills
is getting these made?

22:04.023 --> 22:05.525
I wish I could tell you.

22:05.625 --> 22:06.993
I hated seeing those
make a comeback.

22:07.093 --> 22:09.095
Why, too much competition?
They're so popular.

22:09.195 --> 22:10.830
I was afraid they were gonna
put me out of business.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.732
That's why I put threes

22:12.832 --> 22:15.702
on my pills, hoping people
would mistake 'em for Ws.

22:15.802 --> 22:16.903
So taking
the Ws off the streets

22:17.003 --> 22:18.371
would help your business?
Help?

22:18.471 --> 22:21.140
Hell yeah. It'd give me
total market control.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.676
And how far would you go to
get "total market control"?

22:23.776 --> 22:25.812
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:25.912 --> 22:28.014
Wait, wait, you-you guys
think I did that?

22:28.114 --> 22:30.850
You're the only one here who's
dreaming of an opioid monopoly.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.552
You're also the only one
with armed muscle

22:32.652 --> 22:34.053
that can actually pull it off.

22:34.153 --> 22:35.855
So why wouldn't we think
that you did that?

22:35.955 --> 22:37.857
Okay, I got it.

22:37.957 --> 22:40.727
Something
you can nail Wills with.

22:40.827 --> 22:42.962
Okay, we're listening.
Know why you were able

22:43.062 --> 22:44.731
to take my guys out so easily?

22:44.831 --> 22:47.667
Because my best enforcers
left me a few months ago.

22:47.767 --> 22:49.436
Oh, that's what it was.

22:49.536 --> 22:51.471
Agree to disagree, but go on.

22:51.571 --> 22:53.940
Manny and Omar, they left me
to work for someone else

22:54.040 --> 22:56.776
around the same time the Ws
came back on the market.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.811
So they've got
to be working for Wills!

22:58.911 --> 23:00.079
Does Manny and Omar have
a last name?

23:00.179 --> 23:02.348
Nobody's filling out
W-2s for me.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.617
But if you get them in here,

23:04.717 --> 23:06.218
you show 'em that picture,

23:06.318 --> 23:08.488
they'll turn on Wills
in a heartbeat.

23:08.588 --> 23:09.856
So how do we get them in here?

23:09.956 --> 23:12.525
No idea.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.094
All right.

23:15.194 --> 23:16.496
Whoa, whoa, hey, hey, I mean,

23:16.596 --> 23:18.297
I can set up
a meeting.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.767
It'll work, I swear.

23:24.671 --> 23:26.706
Looks you'll be
hosting a sting op.

23:26.806 --> 23:27.874
The sooner, the better.

23:27.974 --> 23:29.275
Oh.

23:29.375 --> 23:31.578
Looks like Kasie's
got something.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.846
Well, maybe she can tell us
why a successful businessman

23:33.946 --> 23:36.883
decided to return
to dealing drugs.

23:38.350 --> 23:41.053
Their profits just don't add up.

23:41.153 --> 23:43.923
Wills' lawyer sent me
all the financials I requested,

23:44.023 --> 23:46.559
wanting to show that
Wills had nothing to hide.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.928
And?
Oh, he's got plenty to hide.

23:49.028 --> 23:51.097
And he's very bad
at hiding it.

23:51.197 --> 23:53.700
In fact, his own lawyer
even found a few red flags.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.401
How red
are we talking here?

23:55.502 --> 23:57.604
Wills may have sold
a lot of AllDones,

23:57.704 --> 24:00.206
but after the initial sales
surge, his profits plateaued,

24:00.306 --> 24:03.242
and he found himself
very deep in the red.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.478
Wait, so he was losing money
every month?

24:05.578 --> 24:07.480
That's the thing,
he wasn't.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.649
His company has
some other...

24:09.749 --> 24:11.784
revenue stream
keeping them afloat.

24:11.884 --> 24:14.320
Where it's from,
I can't say.

24:14.420 --> 24:15.722
Got to be the drugs.

24:15.822 --> 24:17.189
Just need to find
a way to prove it.

24:17.289 --> 24:19.559
Luckily, I have
my best man

24:19.659 --> 24:21.227
running chemical analysis.

24:21.327 --> 24:22.962
Jimmy?
Not yet.

24:23.062 --> 24:26.566
Excuse me?
I'm still working on the
animations for the chart

24:26.666 --> 24:28.267
I was gonna present.
Just one minute.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.637
Jimmy, you better
give me those...

24:30.737 --> 24:32.505
Behold.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.641
Two sets of pills.

24:34.741 --> 24:36.876
The Ws
from the Navy seizure

24:36.976 --> 24:39.546
and Benny's threes
from the pickle store.

24:39.646 --> 24:43.750
Now, as you can see
from my animated chart...

24:44.651 --> 24:46.553
...the two pills have
two completely

24:46.653 --> 24:48.254
different levels
of fentanyl.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.523
Thereby two...

24:50.623 --> 24:52.091
distinct manufacturers.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.993
One of whom is Clayton Wills?

24:54.093 --> 24:55.995
Well, I can't tell for sure,

24:56.095 --> 24:57.997
but I can tell you that

24:58.097 --> 24:59.999
Benny did not make the Ws.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.602
Which we already know.
We do?

25:02.702 --> 25:03.970
We do, yeah.

25:04.070 --> 25:05.705
But, um, it's cool animation.

25:05.805 --> 25:07.273
Thanks.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.543
Oh, um, I don't know
why you're both

25:10.643 --> 25:12.745
looking for help around here.

25:12.845 --> 25:15.114
You guys have been partners
for years.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.483
Hmm.

25:17.584 --> 25:19.385
Well, the animation was
a nice touch.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.621
Didn't quite stick
the landing, though.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.455
Hey.

25:23.556 --> 25:24.924
Help me down in Autopsy?

25:25.725 --> 25:27.293
Mm-hmm.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.340
I was hoping I wouldn't find
you stewing down here.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.111
First this son
of a bitch

25:45.211 --> 25:47.847
takes out you,
now this poor kid.
Whoa, pal.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.782
I don't know if you can tell
from where you're standing,

25:49.882 --> 25:52.484
but I'm not dead. I'm living.

25:52.585 --> 25:54.120
In fact,
I love my life.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.788
Last I checked,
you're alive, too.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.390
I guess.
You guess?

25:59.792 --> 26:02.028
Your team is just
as you described.

26:02.128 --> 26:04.096
A family that sees you
as one of their own.

26:04.196 --> 26:05.464
You're living, pal.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.433
You just need to look around
and see it.

26:07.533 --> 26:08.735
You think I don't try?

26:08.835 --> 26:10.369
I mean, this place
has been great for me.

26:10.469 --> 26:12.171
It's what I feel
when I'm not here

26:12.271 --> 26:13.940
that gets to me.
I-I fill the silence

26:14.040 --> 26:16.242
with everything I can.
Birds, piano,

26:16.342 --> 26:18.144
pastries!
Well, you got 'em

26:18.244 --> 26:20.579
roped in with the pastries,
I got to say. Good move.

26:20.680 --> 26:23.983
I'm burning alive, Jer,
I mean, this...

26:24.083 --> 26:27.053
this guilt,
I can't shake it off, man.

26:27.854 --> 26:29.555
All right, pal.

26:29.656 --> 26:30.890
Let's get you out of here.

26:30.990 --> 26:32.291
Maybe you need some rest.

26:32.391 --> 26:34.093
Maybe this is how
a person is supposed to feel

26:34.193 --> 26:35.795
after they shoot
their best friend in the back.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.764
Maybe I just have
to accept that

26:37.864 --> 26:39.398
this is just who I am now.

26:39.498 --> 26:42.168
You know I don't blame you
for anything that night.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.170
It was pure
fog of war...

26:44.270 --> 26:46.238
stuff,
bullets in every direction.

26:46.338 --> 26:47.874
Not your fault.
Not my fault?

26:47.974 --> 26:49.742
My bullet hit your spine.

26:49.842 --> 26:52.044
And whether I was shooting
at somebody else or not,

26:52.144 --> 26:54.546
that's definitionally my fault.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.515
Enough.
You can tell
yourself it wasn't.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.150
And that might help
you sleep at night,

26:58.250 --> 26:59.786
but it's what
keeps me up, pal.

26:59.886 --> 27:01.387
Well, you and no one else.

27:01.487 --> 27:03.155
Because what happened

27:03.255 --> 27:06.092
that night stayed
between you, me and our C.O.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.327
We didn't need to lose
two agents that night.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.730
We're not doing this again.
You're not going to console me

27:10.830 --> 27:12.631
about your injury that I caused!

27:12.732 --> 27:13.900
Well, then don't make me!

27:14.000 --> 27:15.301
I mean,
do you think

27:15.401 --> 27:17.236
I like this?

27:17.336 --> 27:19.972
Carrying your guilt
on top of everything?

27:20.072 --> 27:22.274
No. No, Jer.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.410
I never meant to...
Then what is it?

27:24.510 --> 27:27.346
You want punishment? You want
me to be angry with you?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.548
Maybe.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.285
I remember you saying

27:33.385 --> 27:35.221
you kept the letter I wrote

27:35.321 --> 27:37.323
next to your badge and gun
at the Bureau.

27:37.423 --> 27:39.591
I wasn't surprised
to find it

27:39.692 --> 27:41.627
in the same place here.

27:45.631 --> 27:48.267
It's a reminder
to keep levelheaded in the field

27:48.367 --> 27:50.502
and what can happen
if you don't.

27:51.403 --> 27:53.272
I wrote this about, mm,

27:53.372 --> 27:56.008
a month after what happened.

27:56.108 --> 27:57.810
And I was thinking

27:57.910 --> 28:00.412
now is the time to reread it.

28:02.782 --> 28:04.450
Letter's
still sealed, Park.

28:04.550 --> 28:06.618
You never read it.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.788
I'll read your damn letter.

28:08.888 --> 28:10.522
Right after I take out Wills.

28:10.622 --> 28:13.525
Wh-What the hell
are you talking about?

28:13.625 --> 28:15.561
What do you mean,
"take out Wills"?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.766
What's...
Ensign Sims doing out?

28:19.866 --> 28:21.133
C-Can I help you?

28:21.233 --> 28:22.634
I'm fine, Jimmy.
Nobody needs your help here.

28:22.735 --> 28:23.870
Just mind your own business.

28:23.970 --> 28:25.671
All due respect, Agent Parker,

28:25.772 --> 28:27.706
that body <i>is</i> my business.

28:27.807 --> 28:28.975
We were just leaving, Jimmy.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.342
Yeah. Heading home.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.444
I could go for a cold one.
How about you?

28:51.397 --> 28:54.000
I'm telling you, they're
gonna show up any minute.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.234
I think.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.702
McGEE:
You better hope so, Benny.

28:56.803 --> 28:58.771
Yeah. We can't help you
with sentencing

28:58.871 --> 29:00.206
if you can't help us tonight.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.108
These guys
are almost two hours late.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.509
No, no, no, listen.

29:03.609 --> 29:05.111
I made them
a pretty sweet offer.

29:05.211 --> 29:06.779
They'll come.
McGEE:
Well, you got

29:06.879 --> 29:07.780
another half hour, Benny.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.651
So Parker's making beer
and he hasn't shared any?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.486
I was thinking
the exact same thing.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.822
I mean, it's not
like we would drink it

29:15.922 --> 29:17.056
in the squad room or anything.

29:17.156 --> 29:18.624
I'm good
with the pastries.

29:20.993 --> 29:23.129
Ooh. Speak of the devil.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.432
Where we at, McGee?

29:26.532 --> 29:27.733
Parker,
you know I'm not supposed

29:27.834 --> 29:29.201
to be talking to you
about this case

29:29.301 --> 29:30.669
while you're still benched, right?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.004
McGee, I'm not gonna get
in the middle of anything.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.039
I'm home watching the game.

29:33.139 --> 29:34.340
I just want to know

29:34.440 --> 29:35.875
if we're gonna nail this guy
or not.

29:35.975 --> 29:38.477
Well, I wish I had better news
for you, but...

29:38.577 --> 29:41.380
we don't have anything
illegal on this guy yet.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.082
We're waiting
on two of Wills' guys,

29:43.182 --> 29:44.250
but they
haven't shown yet.

29:44.350 --> 29:45.717
So it doesn't look good.

29:46.986 --> 29:48.420
Parker?

29:48.520 --> 29:49.621
Hello?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.824
Our lead's down to six.

29:51.924 --> 29:54.160
They better step it up
on defense.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.228
Eh, no worries.

29:56.328 --> 29:57.363
They're a fourth-quarter team.

29:57.463 --> 29:58.931
Hey, where are the beers?

29:59.031 --> 30:01.000
Oh. You know, I just ran out.

30:01.100 --> 30:03.069
I'll be right back, okay?

30:04.036 --> 30:05.604
Don't lose
the lead.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.699
I'm telling you,
we're wasting our time.

30:33.799 --> 30:34.733
These guys
are not coming.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.002
All right, I'm calling it.

30:36.102 --> 30:37.069
Let's head in.

30:37.169 --> 30:38.837
Just give it ten more minutes.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.077
Hello?
Agent McGee, Jeremy Brighton.

30:45.177 --> 30:46.312
Is Parker with you?

30:46.412 --> 30:48.380
No, I thought he was with you.

30:48.480 --> 30:49.882
Nope. He's gone.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.717
I don't know where he is,
but if I had to guess,

30:51.817 --> 30:53.485
I'd say he's headed to Wills.

30:53.585 --> 30:54.853
Damn it. Okay, um...

30:54.954 --> 30:56.989
Thanks, Brighton.
We'll find him.

30:57.089 --> 30:57.990
Parker?

30:58.090 --> 30:59.959
In the wind. We're done here.

31:02.028 --> 31:04.063
Actually, I think
we're just getting started.

31:04.163 --> 31:05.464
Ah. Told you.

31:05.564 --> 31:09.135
They might run late,
but they got here eventually.

31:11.503 --> 31:14.573
<i>Those sure do look like
World War II-era weapons.</i>

31:14.673 --> 31:16.508
Carried by the same two guys
that tossed Parker and I

31:16.608 --> 31:17.876
out of Wills' warehouse.

31:17.977 --> 31:19.946
I'll take the alley,
circle around back.

31:25.051 --> 31:27.686
Manny. Omar.

31:27.786 --> 31:29.655
How great
to see you both again.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.624
Glad I could pry you
away from your new jobs.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.593
How they treating
you, huh?

31:34.693 --> 31:36.528
You look good. I like that.

31:37.329 --> 31:38.364
NCIS!

31:38.464 --> 31:39.431
Weapons down!

31:39.531 --> 31:40.399
Put it down!

31:40.499 --> 31:41.700
On your knees!

31:47.073 --> 31:50.009
Good?

31:55.381 --> 31:57.749
All right!

31:58.517 --> 32:00.752
You guys can help us out
with this one.

32:02.154 --> 32:03.990
Are those Ws or Ms?

32:12.064 --> 32:13.966
What the hell
took you guys so long?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.934
You can't leave me
hanging like this!

32:16.035 --> 32:18.404
Manny, I need you
in here packing. And, Omar,

32:18.504 --> 32:21.340
get me, uh, some...
Oh, you're really burning
the midnight oil,

32:21.440 --> 32:23.109
aren't you,
Clayton?

32:23.875 --> 32:25.077
You know, the courts
won't like you, uh,

32:25.177 --> 32:26.945
breaking and entering
like this, Alden.

32:27.046 --> 32:30.116
And your parole officer won't
like you sitting there with, uh,

32:30.216 --> 32:31.950
drugs and a gun either.

32:33.619 --> 32:34.586
Nobody was
watching the door.

32:34.686 --> 32:36.222
You a little short-staffed?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.224
It's hard to find good people to
work with these days, isn't it?

32:38.324 --> 32:40.259
No. I've actually had
pretty good luck.

32:40.359 --> 32:44.063
I assume this is
how you keep your company afloat

32:44.163 --> 32:45.497
during tough times?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.968
No one in Silicon Valley
would touch, uh, an ex-con.

32:51.070 --> 32:52.338
First it was working out great.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.173
I was the only, uh, stockholder.

32:54.940 --> 32:59.011
But things change. You run
into a couple of bad quarters,

32:59.111 --> 33:01.547
there's no one there
to bail you out, so...

33:01.647 --> 33:04.016
So... here we are.

33:05.017 --> 33:06.518
You and me.

33:07.286 --> 33:08.454
You come here alone?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.056
I did.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.292
In that case... Hey.

33:14.293 --> 33:15.427
If it's just the two of us,

33:15.527 --> 33:16.762
let's be frank.

33:16.862 --> 33:19.598
How can I help you,
Alden, hmm?

33:19.698 --> 33:21.800
What do you need?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.842
So, is that-- is that it?

33:30.942 --> 33:33.645
You want me
to reach for the gun?

33:33.745 --> 33:35.547
Hmm? So you can take me out?

33:35.647 --> 33:39.551
Justified shooting?

33:41.687 --> 33:42.921
Hmm?

33:46.725 --> 33:48.427
Doesn't matter what I want.

33:48.527 --> 33:50.362
I'm here to take you in.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.666
But I will put you down
without a second thought, so...

33:54.766 --> 33:57.236
yeah, don't touch the gun.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.867
Turn around!

34:30.136 --> 34:31.203
On your knees!

34:31.303 --> 34:33.639
Now!

34:34.673 --> 34:35.574
Pl...

34:35.674 --> 34:36.575
Please.

34:36.675 --> 34:37.976
Please don't kill me.

34:41.147 --> 34:42.314
What?

34:43.849 --> 34:46.252
Are you actually begging?

34:46.352 --> 34:48.787
Yeah, why not?

34:48.887 --> 34:51.657
I'm-I'm not some evil genius.

34:52.424 --> 34:54.059
I'm trash.

34:54.160 --> 34:55.861
Okay? I get that.

34:57.163 --> 35:00.832
Just-just please don't kill me.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.808
I'm not gonna kill you.

35:11.042 --> 35:15.113
Wh-Why'd you come to my,
my office by yourself? Hmm?

35:16.748 --> 35:19.351
Why are you here, Parker?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.119
What do you want?

35:27.092 --> 35:29.728
I want to end all this.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.200
I want you to confess

35:34.300 --> 35:38.136
to the killing of that Navy kid
driving the truck.

35:38.237 --> 35:39.605
Ensign Clyde Sims.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.473
He doesn't need
to confess, Parker.

35:41.573 --> 35:43.008
His workers
did it for him.

35:43.108 --> 35:44.743
Wills ordered them
to steal back the bootlegs

35:44.843 --> 35:46.011
and leave no witnesses.

35:46.111 --> 35:48.814
No getting out
early this time.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.294
So much for being benched.

36:03.762 --> 36:05.597
Parker, we had this
under control.

36:05.697 --> 36:08.066
What did you come here
to do tonight?

36:11.803 --> 36:13.104
Just needed to be sure, McGee,

36:13.205 --> 36:15.841
that he was taken away.

36:17.509 --> 36:19.044
It's over now.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.382
I'm good.

36:28.354 --> 36:29.688
<i>Turns out the lawyer</i>

36:29.788 --> 36:31.223
for WillsNet
is taking over the company.

36:31.323 --> 36:33.759
She was the only person
who would give him money,

36:33.859 --> 36:37.095
making her the sole investor
who is not in jail.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.864
Yeah, apparently
she's a true believer in,

36:38.964 --> 36:41.500
uh, helping parolees getting
their lives back on track.

36:41.600 --> 36:42.868
Nice. Good
to hear.

36:42.968 --> 36:44.135
I was gonna tell Delilah

36:44.236 --> 36:45.571
that we're getting rid
of the AllDones,

36:45.671 --> 36:47.973
but, uh, if the company's
really helping people,

36:48.073 --> 36:49.908
then I feel pretty good
about keeping 'em.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.443
Let's go. It's quitting time.

36:51.543 --> 36:52.778
Uh, not for me.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.013
When Parker got benched,
I took lead, so...

36:55.113 --> 36:57.616
that leaves me
with the after action report.

36:57.716 --> 37:00.352
It'll only take me a couple
hours, so you guys go ahead.

37:05.557 --> 37:08.660
Um, I will get started
on the sting details.

37:08.760 --> 37:12.531
Yeah, and send me everything you
got on, uh... on Wills so far.

37:12.631 --> 37:14.800
You got it.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.871
Yeah, good as new. Almost.

37:21.473 --> 37:22.674
Thanks, Jimmy.

37:22.774 --> 37:24.876
I'm sorry that I yelled
at you earlier.

37:24.976 --> 37:26.244
You didn't deserve that.

37:26.345 --> 37:27.713
No worries.

37:27.813 --> 37:29.315
Thanks for saying that, though.

37:29.415 --> 37:31.216
I understand.

37:31.317 --> 37:34.353
No one should be judged
by their worst days.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.423
Ah.

37:37.523 --> 37:39.625
Okay, Dr. Palmer.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.126
All of your body-cutting
sharp things

37:41.226 --> 37:42.594
are officially sterilized,

37:42.694 --> 37:44.062
which leaves me
officially done

37:44.162 --> 37:45.397
for the day as
your assistant.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.766
Which, I got to say,
feels pretty good.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.435
Thanks, Kase.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.005
All right. Well...

37:54.105 --> 37:56.942
you two have
a good night.

37:58.043 --> 38:00.278
Turn the lights out
when you leave.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.151
"No one should be judged
by their worst days."

38:06.251 --> 38:07.486
I like that.

38:07.586 --> 38:09.120
Jimmy's always coming up
with stuff like that.

38:09.220 --> 38:09.921
He's good.

38:10.021 --> 38:11.156
But how about you?

38:11.256 --> 38:12.758
How you doing, pal?
Feeling any better?

38:12.858 --> 38:13.825
I don't know.

38:13.925 --> 38:15.293
I always thought of that creep

38:15.394 --> 38:17.463
as some kind
of criminal mastermind.

38:17.563 --> 38:20.832
So I'd be certain that when I
took him down, I'd feel better.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.401
But instead

38:22.501 --> 38:24.202
nothing's changed.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.504
Want to know what I think?
Would it

38:25.604 --> 38:27.539
stop you if I didn't?

38:27.639 --> 38:28.640
I think you're stuck, pal.

38:28.740 --> 38:30.008
And I don't think arresting

38:30.108 --> 38:31.843
anyone is gonna change that
for you.

38:31.943 --> 38:34.245
If anything, I feel worse.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.685
Oh, come on.

38:39.785 --> 38:40.952
Not that letter again.

38:41.052 --> 38:42.554
I get that you weren't ready before...

38:42.654 --> 38:44.790
And what if I'm still not?
Well, then, too bad.

38:44.890 --> 38:46.124
Just read it. Out loud.

38:46.224 --> 38:48.860
I'm not gonna read your letter
out loud.

38:48.960 --> 38:49.961
You know what it says.

38:50.061 --> 38:51.296
You heard it already.

38:51.397 --> 38:52.898
You don't need to hear it.
But you do.

38:52.998 --> 38:54.065
Then you read it.
Which one of us

38:54.165 --> 38:55.601
has the wheelchair?

38:56.735 --> 38:58.604
I forget.

38:59.971 --> 39:02.741
Think I like playing that card?

39:02.841 --> 39:03.942
I do not.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.478
But I've already dealt
with that night.

39:07.479 --> 39:08.614
You haven't.

39:12.651 --> 39:14.386
Okay.

39:21.893 --> 39:23.128
"Parker."

39:25.797 --> 39:27.433
"Ask a higher power

39:27.533 --> 39:30.902
"why bad things
happen to good people,

39:31.002 --> 39:33.238
"I'm pretty sure
you'd come up empty.

39:33.338 --> 39:36.875
"What I can tell you is that
I've spent far too much time

39:36.975 --> 39:38.977
"resenting you.

39:39.077 --> 39:40.311
Hating you..."

39:40.712 --> 39:41.847
Give me that.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.482
Out loud.

39:47.486 --> 39:48.920
All right.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.492
"...far too much time
resenting you. Hating you.

39:53.592 --> 39:56.595
Dreaming of you lying
in a pool of your own blood."

39:56.695 --> 39:57.929
Very good.

39:59.197 --> 40:02.233
"And this time I'd be
the one pulling the trigger.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.735
"But that was yesterday.

40:03.835 --> 40:06.605
Today I'm choosing to..."

40:10.442 --> 40:13.278
"Today I'm choosing
to move forward.

40:13.378 --> 40:18.416
"It's normal to be consumed
and frozen by fear and trauma.

40:18.517 --> 40:20.151
"I was in
