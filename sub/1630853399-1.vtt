WEBVTT

02:24.427 --> 02:26.679
Cops. They're all corrupt.

02:26.763 --> 02:30.850
They set me up, threatened me,
forced me to testify.

02:31.434 --> 02:32.894
I had no choice.

02:33.061 --> 02:36.064
Could we talk this out, huh?
On the ground?

02:36.147 --> 02:37.565
We're not here
to talk, Sugar.

02:41.444 --> 02:44.113
God. Come on, man.
She's clean.

02:44.197 --> 02:45.948
She doesn't rate this shit.

02:46.032 --> 02:47.533
You know what else she doesn't rate?

02:47.992 --> 02:50.578
Her boyfriend in witness protection
who comes back for a quick taste.

02:51.913 --> 02:53.331
That's on you.

02:54.916 --> 02:55.958
Time to split.

02:56.042 --> 02:59.379
- No, no, no. No. No.

02:59.796 --> 03:00.880
No.

03:08.638 --> 03:10.014
- What the fuck?

03:10.098 --> 03:11.265
Move back.

03:11.933 --> 03:14.102
Weapons down. Hands up.

03:14.185 --> 03:15.395
Where?

03:15.478 --> 03:18.147
Put your weapons
on the ground, hands up.

03:18.231 --> 03:19.107
Over there.

03:21.150 --> 03:22.568
Weapons down.

03:24.320 --> 03:27.865
Cease fire. Cease fire.
We're coming in. Hands up.

03:38.876 --> 03:39.919
He's over there!

03:41.295 --> 03:43.756
Fuck you! Motherfucker!

03:47.593 --> 03:48.553
Fuck!

03:48.636 --> 03:49.595
Get him!

03:55.726 --> 03:56.894
There's just one!

04:06.028 --> 04:06.988
Reload!

04:30.470 --> 04:31.637
I'm innocent, man.

04:51.908 --> 04:52.992
Come on.

05:16.140 --> 05:17.475
Damn, bro. Thank you.

05:17.600 --> 05:18.601
Shut up.

05:19.977 --> 05:21.354
You blew your cover.

05:21.437 --> 05:24.315
You risked her life and the lives
of my deputies assigned to protect you.

05:24.398 --> 05:26.526
I know, bro. I'm so, so sorry.

05:26.609 --> 05:28.611
Baby, I'm so, so sorry.

05:28.736 --> 05:29.862
Fuck you!

05:30.071 --> 05:31.113
Go to hell!

05:31.197 --> 05:32.448
So now you're special.

05:32.532 --> 05:33.616
Special?

05:33.741 --> 05:36.035
- Oh, my Jesus! No, bro, please.
- No.

05:36.118 --> 05:38.454
I'll do anything you say,
straight up, bro. I promise.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.455
I'm not your bro.

05:40.039 --> 05:41.958
Wait. Just tell me what
you want me to do.

05:42.041 --> 05:43.751
Sir, I'll do anything.

05:44.961 --> 05:46.003
I want you to die.

06:05.147 --> 06:06.399
Thank you. Thank you.

06:07.149 --> 06:08.609
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

06:10.111 --> 06:11.654
You've just been erased.

06:49.233 --> 06:50.443
What the fuck is that?

06:53.195 --> 06:54.697
You're supposed to look
like my hot young wife,

06:54.780 --> 06:56.407
not some middle-aged banker.

06:57.116 --> 06:58.242
Yes, Kosta.

06:58.326 --> 07:00.911
Our biggest potential investors
are going to be here.

07:01.370 --> 07:03.998
We need their money
to make ours look legit.

07:05.082 --> 07:07.418
So if they talk to you, smile.

07:07.501 --> 07:09.629
If they make a joke, laugh.

07:12.089 --> 07:13.758
And if one of them flirts with you,

07:15.509 --> 07:16.927
you bring him in here,

07:17.553 --> 07:20.765
you bend over the sink
and you make him see the stars.

07:23.017 --> 07:24.101
Understand?

07:33.361 --> 07:35.154
Stay calm, Mrs. Kimura.

07:35.237 --> 07:36.697
We're right here with you, Rina.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.206
No, you're not.

07:55.800 --> 07:56.759
Hey.

07:58.386 --> 07:59.762
Who you burying tonight, bruh, huh?

08:00.846 --> 08:03.974
Ugh, I tend to my flock,
you tend to yours.

08:04.058 --> 08:05.267
Isn't that what you taught me?

08:05.351 --> 08:06.477
Did I, Mace?

08:07.103 --> 08:08.604
- I can't remember.

08:08.688 --> 08:10.106
Re-educate a brother.

08:12.692 --> 08:13.609
You're a good cop.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.278
Maybe one of the best we have.

08:16.987 --> 08:17.905
Maybe.

08:18.906 --> 08:20.074
Had a good commander.

08:21.992 --> 08:23.244
No, you had a great Commander.

08:24.995 --> 08:26.247
Enjoy the ride while it lasts.

08:26.664 --> 08:27.873
Program's on the chopping block.

08:29.417 --> 08:30.584
Don't mess with me.

08:32.253 --> 08:33.629
Open your eyes, now.

08:34.547 --> 08:37.550
We're the bad guys. Unfundable.

08:37.675 --> 08:41.178
Thugs who move in the shadows,
guzzling tax dollars,

08:41.262 --> 08:44.098
protecting people
who aren't exactly model citizens.

08:44.432 --> 08:45.891
It's our duty to protect those people.

08:46.225 --> 08:48.436
We're dinosaurs staring
into the eyes of a comet.

08:48.519 --> 08:50.813
Pretty soon, we have to erase ourselves.

08:51.439 --> 08:53.858
Say the word, old man.
I can make that happen.

08:57.361 --> 08:59.447
Easy. I'm just the messenger, baby.

09:00.156 --> 09:01.157
Huh?

09:03.451 --> 09:05.453
- Kosta.
- Marco.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.834
Check it out.

09:12.668 --> 09:14.920
So big, so green.

09:16.255 --> 09:17.548
They love that.

09:17.631 --> 09:19.467
The council are very excited.

09:20.634 --> 09:22.511
- You spoke to them?
- I did.

09:35.399 --> 09:36.692
About time.

09:37.234 --> 09:38.360
Get to work.

09:40.696 --> 09:42.990
You look beautiful.

09:45.075 --> 09:46.410
I was told I had to be.

09:46.911 --> 09:47.995
It's a big event.

09:49.246 --> 09:50.956
But you look so calm, Marco.

09:51.832 --> 09:53.793
- I'm a good faker.
- Mmm.

09:55.002 --> 09:57.755
Well, we both are.

10:01.258 --> 10:02.259
What?

10:04.345 --> 10:05.471
Come, princess.

10:11.435 --> 10:13.938
Rina, this is Mr. Winks.

10:14.021 --> 10:15.731
He's a great new friend of ours.

10:16.649 --> 10:18.943
You have superb taste, Kosta.

10:20.402 --> 10:23.739
She'll babysit you
while I do my song and dance.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.199
- Thank you.
- Have fun.

10:28.953 --> 10:30.830
May I have
your attention, please?

10:31.622 --> 10:33.624
Welcome, friends.

10:34.208 --> 10:35.918
You beautiful people,
gather around...

10:36.001 --> 10:37.753
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

10:39.338 --> 10:41.423
...and bear witness
to something amazing.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.553
This project represents the future.

10:45.636 --> 10:48.722
The one we've been
working towards for years.

10:48.806 --> 10:51.183
- Our future.
- crowd Our future.

10:56.856 --> 10:58.941
Just grabbing something for Mr. Kimura.

11:12.913 --> 11:14.331
Okay, get a move on.

11:15.082 --> 11:16.250
You don't have much time.

11:31.181 --> 11:33.142
Good. Quickly now.

11:33.225 --> 11:35.769
Got it. I'm moving
as fast as I... oh, shit.

11:35.853 --> 11:37.813
Ugh!
The necklace just fell.

11:38.772 --> 11:40.399
The camera. We can't see anything.

11:40.482 --> 11:42.067
I dropped it.
Hold on, I'm looking for it.

11:42.151 --> 11:43.903
I can't seem to find it.

11:44.403 --> 11:45.529
Forget it. There's no time.

11:47.072 --> 11:48.908
- Moving as fast as I can, guys.

11:48.991 --> 11:51.368
Moving as fast as I can.

11:55.623 --> 11:56.749
What was that?

11:57.207 --> 11:58.167
Mrs. Kimura?

11:59.251 --> 12:00.294
Mrs. Kimura?

12:02.922 --> 12:04.340
Are you okay?
What's happening?

12:05.299 --> 12:08.177
It's done. Go. Finish up and get out.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.219
I got it.

12:10.471 --> 12:12.431
Yep. Leaving right now.

12:13.057 --> 12:14.308
Where's my wife?

12:22.858 --> 12:24.318
You left that whale alone.

12:24.735 --> 12:25.778
I got nervous.

12:26.278 --> 12:27.655
Yeah, what are you doing in here?

12:28.572 --> 12:29.531
Hmm?

12:30.824 --> 12:31.867
My safe!

12:35.454 --> 12:36.914
I'm leaving you, Kosta.

12:37.414 --> 12:39.124
The FBI has all your files
on your drive.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.501
You are going to prison.

12:40.584 --> 12:42.169
No, don't engage him.

12:42.252 --> 12:43.170
I'm going free.

12:43.253 --> 12:44.380
Go to the front now!

12:44.463 --> 12:45.506
We'll pick you up. Let's go!

12:48.509 --> 12:49.635
FBI?

12:50.052 --> 12:51.679
Don't you get it?

12:51.762 --> 12:54.598
My people own their people.

12:55.224 --> 12:59.687
Now you, on the other hand,
you have nothing. Nobody.

12:59.979 --> 13:02.773
And you're not going anywhere.

13:10.197 --> 13:11.198
You bitch.

13:14.034 --> 13:15.786
-  Huh?

13:15.869 --> 13:17.079
Now, you listen to me you little...

13:33.846 --> 13:36.432
Marco, he was drunk. He fell.

13:37.766 --> 13:38.976
Nobody leaves.

13:39.727 --> 13:41.395
Wait. Where are you going?

13:41.478 --> 13:43.397
I just need some air.

13:47.359 --> 13:49.194
I'll take care of this,
but you can't go anywhere.

13:52.698 --> 13:54.783
You're always so kind, Marco.

13:56.035 --> 13:57.494
Forgive me.

14:00.164 --> 14:01.540
FBI.

14:01.623 --> 14:03.083
- Put down the gun!

14:03.167 --> 14:05.044
- Get in, Mrs. Kimura. Move.
- Get back here!

14:05.127 --> 14:06.253
Go!

14:07.629 --> 14:08.756
Rina!

14:10.507 --> 14:13.302
- We made a deal
- Before she killed Kosta Kimura.

14:13.635 --> 14:15.012
And starred in that shit show.

14:15.095 --> 14:18.724
We need a guarantee that your client
will show up and testify at trial.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.142
Otherwise, no deal.

14:20.225 --> 14:22.978
Mrs. Kimura delivered
everything you asked for.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.063
You need to wrap this up.

14:24.146 --> 14:26.356
Give her the passport you promised
and send us on our way.

14:27.024 --> 14:28.567
I want you to meet Deputy Pollard.

14:29.109 --> 14:30.736
Hell no. Pollard?

14:30.819 --> 14:33.739
She's not going
into any witness program.

14:34.281 --> 14:35.908
Mrs. Kimura,

14:35.991 --> 14:39.161
I'm here to offer you federal protection
at a safe location until the trial.

14:39.745 --> 14:40.996
You're playing us.

14:41.830 --> 14:44.958
This is why nobody trusts you people.

14:45.042 --> 14:48.170
You don't need to trust us, ma'am.
You just need to stay alive.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.297
And live like some kind of prisoner.

14:50.380 --> 14:51.340
That's up to you.

14:52.424 --> 14:54.301
- You people are all the same.
- Yeah.

14:54.968 --> 14:56.095
We're done here.

14:58.680 --> 14:59.723
Mrs. Kimura.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.478
I know you're afraid.

15:05.312 --> 15:07.272
But you like walking, right?

15:08.190 --> 15:09.608
- Is he for real?
- Yeah.

15:10.734 --> 15:12.444
Are you threatening me?

15:12.528 --> 15:15.239
You don't take our offer
and I can tell you from experience,

15:15.322 --> 15:18.408
what you take for granted now,
will become an exercise in running,

15:20.035 --> 15:21.703
Wondering what's
around every corner

15:21.787 --> 15:24.331
until what's around the corner
kills you.

15:24.414 --> 15:25.958
But you can save me, right?

15:26.542 --> 15:28.043
I can help you stay alive.

15:28.127 --> 15:29.545
And make it to trial?

15:30.379 --> 15:32.756
That's all you
really care about, isn't it?

15:32.840 --> 15:35.384
- Mrs. Kimura...
- I have plans, Deputy.

15:36.051 --> 15:38.595
And they don't include another man
who knows what's best for me.

15:39.638 --> 15:41.390
Nice to have met you, Mrs. Kimura.

15:43.267 --> 15:44.643
Great to see you too, Vanessa.

15:49.940 --> 15:53.902
I've shamed the organization.
I know what must be done.

16:11.211 --> 16:13.130
She played us both, Kosta.

16:18.135 --> 16:19.178
Now we play her.

16:28.187 --> 16:29.104
Ugh.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.205
Royal.

16:46.872 --> 16:47.998
Express.

16:49.541 --> 16:50.667
Venue.

16:53.295 --> 16:55.631
Hello.

16:59.051 --> 17:00.052
Vanessa?

17:02.095 --> 17:03.639
It's necessary for now.

17:09.186 --> 17:11.104
You've been waiting
for this day, Rina.

17:11.563 --> 17:14.107
Don't let some Fed bully
spoil it for you.

17:17.778 --> 17:18.779
To freedom?

17:20.989 --> 17:23.075
- To freedom.

17:24.576 --> 17:25.619
Pollard.

17:26.411 --> 17:27.412
Inside.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.831
- They're coming.
- Do as he says. Go.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.750
Inform your team.

17:32.918 --> 17:34.711
Marshals are here.
We're coming in.

17:35.170 --> 17:36.463
Coming in, kill the lights.

17:38.006 --> 17:39.216
- Go.
- Positions, now!

17:40.133 --> 17:41.593
Lock the gate. Let's move it!

17:42.302 --> 17:45.055
- Lock the door behind you. Stay down.

17:50.060 --> 17:51.019
He's here!

17:52.354 --> 17:53.313
Damn it!

17:57.484 --> 17:58.402
Smoke bomb!

18:24.970 --> 18:26.471
No. No!

19:00.422 --> 19:03.133
The cold wallet, Rina. Where is it?

19:05.719 --> 19:06.720
Marco?

19:39.294 --> 19:40.212
Remember this.

19:43.256 --> 19:44.257
You!

19:45.550 --> 19:48.053
I need your clothes.
Everything you have on you.

19:48.136 --> 19:49.096
What? Why?

19:49.179 --> 19:51.640
They'll be back. Change, now.

19:56.645 --> 19:58.105
I need you to move faster, ma'am.

19:59.689 --> 20:00.982
Give me your dress, now.

20:02.442 --> 20:03.360
I need you to hurry up.

20:03.944 --> 20:05.821
The guys inside weren't on their own.
Come on.

20:06.154 --> 20:06.988
Quicker.

20:08.323 --> 20:10.242
Sixty seconds. Come on, faster.

20:13.245 --> 20:14.788
- Come on. Come on. Come on.
- I'm going!

20:17.207 --> 20:19.543
- I don't know what you're doing.
- Shoes.

20:24.714 --> 20:25.799
Fuck this!

20:26.508 --> 20:28.176
Hey, where you gonna go?

20:30.470 --> 20:31.471
Let me go!

20:34.641 --> 20:35.642
Stop.

20:37.519 --> 20:38.395
Don't move.

20:43.900 --> 20:45.861
- Behind you!

21:05.839 --> 21:09.050
Congratulations,
you've just been erased.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.769
That poor woman, her body...

21:22.063 --> 21:23.148
Did you...

21:24.566 --> 21:25.859
dig her up or...

21:27.652 --> 21:28.528
What?

21:28.612 --> 21:30.780
She'll match your height,
your weight,

21:30.864 --> 21:32.908
your DNA, your prints,
your dental records.

21:33.033 --> 21:34.034
I took care of it.

21:34.284 --> 21:36.828
Her face was disfigured
from the sulfuric acid they used

21:36.912 --> 21:39.164
- to assault and torture you.
- Is this some kind of joke?

21:39.956 --> 21:41.666
- I almost died.
- You did die.

21:43.043 --> 21:44.211
That's the point.

21:44.878 --> 21:46.922
That's what the world
is going to think until you testify.

21:47.005 --> 21:49.382
It's not very efficient,
but it was your choice.

21:53.595 --> 21:54.554
That was our deal.

21:59.226 --> 22:00.310
"Rachel?"

22:01.686 --> 22:04.773
I'm not a Rachel.
I told you, no witness protection.

22:06.900 --> 22:07.734
Okay.

22:09.069 --> 22:09.903
Lean forward.

22:18.245 --> 22:20.205
Go, stay...

22:20.622 --> 22:22.457
Whatever. We don't give you
another chance.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.751
- We?
- My bosses.

22:25.293 --> 22:27.379
The American people,
the people who need your help.

22:28.755 --> 22:31.258
I've just been erased
by Captain Fucking America.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.717
Listen,

22:33.426 --> 22:36.972
you testify, and I swear
I'll do my best to keep you safe,

22:37.055 --> 22:39.099
- but we do it...
- My way or the highway?

22:40.350 --> 22:41.351
Got it.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.482
I need a minute... please.

22:50.652 --> 22:51.570
One minute.

23:22.100 --> 23:24.019
- Mrs. Kimura...

23:25.353 --> 23:26.271
Rachel.

23:28.982 --> 23:30.108
Call me Rachel.

23:42.787 --> 23:44.247
Where are you taking me?

23:46.041 --> 23:47.959
Mason A place
for special cases like yours.

23:49.377 --> 23:51.796
So far out of bounds,
you can breathe.

24:52.732 --> 24:55.193
Paradise or prison, it's your choice.

24:58.613 --> 25:00.573
- Welcome to Cape Town.

25:04.077 --> 25:05.120
Go ahead.

25:09.582 --> 25:10.750
Make yourself at home.

25:14.129 --> 25:15.547
Go and stand by the green.

25:17.966 --> 25:19.050
Turn around slowly.

25:21.261 --> 25:22.387
Why?

25:22.470 --> 25:25.432
We use your own biometrics
to fool recognition software.

25:25.515 --> 25:27.892
It's like a digital poison pill.

25:28.643 --> 25:31.438
Any camera anywhere in the world
recognizes your face,

25:32.939 --> 25:34.733
our backdoor bot scrambles it.

25:35.608 --> 25:36.776
Bye, Big Brother.

25:37.902 --> 25:38.820
Who made this?

25:39.487 --> 25:40.572
Big Brother.

25:41.364 --> 25:43.241
There's cash in there. Rands.

25:43.700 --> 25:46.286
Enough to go shopping. Get you started.

25:46.369 --> 25:48.079
You're also going
to get an allowance from us.

25:49.914 --> 25:51.708
You're my warden and my daddy.

25:53.626 --> 25:54.586
Take a selfie.

26:04.012 --> 26:06.139
- Whoa!
- Yeah.

26:07.348 --> 26:08.516
This is too weird.

26:08.975 --> 26:10.226
I mean, it's me, but...

26:12.061 --> 26:13.188
it's not me.

26:13.897 --> 26:16.357
Stay off Rina Kimura's social media.

26:16.858 --> 26:19.736
No texting, no contacting anyone
from your old life.

26:20.153 --> 26:21.112
Don't even check it.

26:22.155 --> 26:23.114
Ever.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.034
Rina Kimura is dead.

26:30.121 --> 26:31.456
Rina Kimura is dead.

26:33.041 --> 26:36.211
Let's take you
to Action News 6 reporter Sean...

26:36.294 --> 26:38.379
Rina Kimura is no longer a concern.

26:40.465 --> 26:43.426
The cold wallet is missing.
It will be recovered.

26:47.639 --> 26:48.848
Who helped her?

26:53.228 --> 26:54.479
Where is it?

27:19.170 --> 27:20.129
Morning.

27:20.755 --> 27:21.923
Feed the prisoner.

27:23.716 --> 27:27.804
Plus, it's as far away as we can get you
from the Syndicate in L.A.

27:28.346 --> 27:29.681
Quite the eater, Pollard.

27:31.224 --> 27:32.725
How often do you get back here?

27:34.227 --> 27:37.438
Well, the Cape Malay cuisine
can't be beat.

27:38.690 --> 27:39.774
More hot sauce?

27:40.567 --> 27:41.568
Rachel?

27:43.611 --> 27:45.613
Try the bobotie, it's good.

27:47.156 --> 27:49.284
I really wish you'd let me
keep that passport.

27:51.786 --> 27:53.037
It'd mean a lot to me.

28:03.172 --> 28:05.133
When this is all over,
what are you going to do?

28:09.012 --> 28:10.054
Actually,

28:10.680 --> 28:11.890
I do have a plan.

28:13.558 --> 28:15.059
It's goofy, you'll laugh.

28:15.643 --> 28:19.731
Well, you won't, but most humans might.

28:26.946 --> 28:28.072
Financial planning.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.535
You know, in my opinion,
key to having true freedom in life...

28:33.995 --> 28:35.288
is financial planning.

28:37.248 --> 28:40.335
Making sure you're never
in debt to anyone.

28:42.295 --> 28:44.047
I'm gonna go to school.

28:44.130 --> 28:46.841
I am gonna get a degree in finance.

28:48.843 --> 28:50.303
And I'm gonna help people...

28:52.722 --> 28:53.765
like me.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.649
Hey.

29:03.107 --> 29:05.485
Relax, just going to the bathroom...

29:06.110 --> 29:07.070
Dad.

29:25.046 --> 29:26.172
Everything okay?

29:26.631 --> 29:28.257
Yeah, just...

29:29.050 --> 29:30.009
waiting.

30:06.629 --> 30:07.630
Marshal Rhodes.

30:08.089 --> 30:09.465
There's been a breach.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.218
Are any of my witnesses compromised?

30:12.844 --> 30:15.471
Unclear. There's a team
headed your way now.

30:15.930 --> 30:17.098
You know the drill.

30:18.307 --> 30:19.350
Understood.

30:29.277 --> 30:30.278
Mace.

30:30.570 --> 30:31.904
Welcome to Cape Town.

30:32.405 --> 30:35.074
Paradise or prison.
Isn't that your schtick, bruh?

30:36.242 --> 30:37.535
- Oltcheck.
- Mason.

30:37.618 --> 30:38.828
You believe this shit?

30:38.911 --> 30:40.913
Since we started this program,
never been anything

30:40.997 --> 30:42.832
but happily ever after... until now.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.210
NSA swept up some chatter yesterday.

30:46.294 --> 30:48.921
Encrypted calls between
the Syndicate Council.

30:49.005 --> 30:51.340
They know your witness
isn't dead, Mason.

30:52.717 --> 30:54.052
I covered every base.

30:55.011 --> 30:56.804
Every move. This is your car.

30:56.888 --> 30:59.849
If it makes you feel any better,
mine may have exposure, too.

31:01.100 --> 31:02.143
Is she okay?

31:02.769 --> 31:06.814
I think so. I mean, even Marshal Rhodes
doesn't know where I stashed her.

31:06.898 --> 31:08.483
I heard she's a handful.

31:08.566 --> 31:11.235
Maybe she broke cover,
dropped a clue. Who knows?

31:12.028 --> 31:12.945
You trust her?

31:13.029 --> 31:14.822
You taught me better than that, Paul.

31:14.906 --> 31:17.366
Our orders are to move everyone
in the program.

31:17.784 --> 31:19.202
Re-erase them.

31:19.911 --> 31:21.829
I need time to figure this out.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.372
Your witness, your call.

31:24.373 --> 31:26.125
Mine, I'm extracting out.

31:26.209 --> 31:29.295
We could use a shooter
and looter like you, Mason.

31:29.796 --> 31:31.464
Unless you're going straight
for your witness.

31:31.923 --> 31:33.758
I got your backs.

31:34.634 --> 31:35.760
It's good to see you, bro.

31:36.052 --> 31:37.637
Now, this gonna be live.

32:47.248 --> 32:49.083
- How are you, gorgeous?
- Hey, Paul.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.378
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

32:52.461 --> 32:54.297
Deputy Oltcheck, meet Felicia.

32:54.380 --> 32:56.632
Galloway. Strategic Surveillance Unit.

32:56.716 --> 32:59.177
Our local badge in case things get hot.

32:59.635 --> 33:01.637
She's got great assets.

33:01.721 --> 33:03.848
- Don't be a pig, Whitlock.
- All right.

33:04.098 --> 33:06.058
We're plucking out
one of your witnesses, huh?

33:06.309 --> 33:07.894
I can't tell you who she is
or what she did,

33:07.977 --> 33:10.021
but I'd give my left nut to protect her.

33:10.313 --> 33:11.355
Let's roll.

33:14.025 --> 33:15.443
Interesting choice, Paul.

33:16.027 --> 33:18.029
Planting your witness in this shithole.

33:18.404 --> 33:21.699
This shithole is directly tied
to the history of apartheid.

33:21.782 --> 33:25.161
A fancy word for what happens
when people get scared.

33:25.661 --> 33:28.497
Scared enough to mobilize
whole governments and laws

33:28.581 --> 33:30.750
to push black
and brown people out of cities.

33:30.833 --> 33:32.919
Deprive them of access to the best jobs,

33:33.002 --> 33:35.963
electricity and running water
and worse...

33:36.047 --> 33:37.715
pit them against each other.

33:38.174 --> 33:40.134
Yeah, so why don't they just go?

33:40.218 --> 33:42.345
Or buy the land, like everyone else?

33:42.720 --> 33:46.098
The game's rigged. Why buy into a system
that's intent on destroying you?

33:46.182 --> 33:49.060
The rules are set up for you to fail,
you do what?

33:49.143 --> 33:51.771
Change the rules of engagement,
my brother.

33:52.146 --> 33:53.522
You got me shouting in this bitch.

33:53.606 --> 33:56.651
Must've been a trip, Mason,
serving with this legend.

33:56.984 --> 33:58.194
More like an honor.

33:58.819 --> 34:02.573
So you dropped your witness here
because you knew no one would find her?

34:04.492 --> 34:05.534
Paul?

34:06.285 --> 34:07.370
She's not answering.

34:11.290 --> 34:13.292
- Nobody comes or goes.
- Galloway Got it.

34:36.232 --> 34:37.483
That's not cupcakes.

34:37.566 --> 34:39.026
Never said she was a saint.

34:39.902 --> 34:41.112
Dagga grow.

34:42.571 --> 34:44.282
- Marijuana.
- Oltcheck, take the back.

34:47.410 --> 34:49.829
How many doors have we been through
just like this, Mason?

34:50.371 --> 34:51.455
Too many.

34:53.416 --> 34:55.251
Police, open up.

35:24.530 --> 35:26.240
- Clear.
- Left clear.

36:05.696 --> 36:06.739
Boyfriend.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.053
- Psst!

37:38.372 --> 37:40.040
- You're early.
- You're late.

37:53.888 --> 37:54.930
He can't hurt you.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.100
He can't hurt you anymore.

38:00.436 --> 38:01.479
It's okay.

38:02.855 --> 38:04.940
- I got you.

38:31.926 --> 38:33.969
She's been hit.
She needs an ambulance. Go, Felicia.

38:35.012 --> 38:35.971
Go.

38:47.650 --> 38:48.692
Paul.

39:05.167 --> 39:06.126
We lost her.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.715
Why send five men to kill her?

39:11.966 --> 39:13.592
Her or us?

39:17.596 --> 39:19.139
They weren't dealers, Mace.

39:19.515 --> 39:20.808
These men were pros.

39:21.850 --> 39:23.477
It was a setup, a trap.

39:24.895 --> 39:26.397
Hey, Pollard.

39:27.815 --> 39:29.024
Isn't she one of yours?

39:33.195 --> 39:35.823
Call Rina Kimura, Pollard, now.

39:38.826 --> 39:40.911
I have to live-contact her.
That's our arrangement.

39:42.246 --> 39:43.205
Where is she?

39:45.124 --> 39:46.041
Downtown.

39:46.125 --> 39:48.168
Okay. Let's go grab her.

40:07.563 --> 40:08.564
What you doing?

40:09.231 --> 40:11.817
Just informing Marshal Rhodes
we're extracting my witness.

40:16.864 --> 40:17.781
Okay.

40:21.243 --> 40:22.536
27 Gratz Road.

40:24.663 --> 40:25.956
That's good work back there.

40:27.541 --> 40:28.626
You okay?

40:29.585 --> 40:30.878
Yeah, you?

40:32.588 --> 40:33.839
I'm tripping.

40:36.842 --> 40:38.510
Something I've to talk to you about.

40:40.054 --> 40:41.138
It's important.

40:42.389 --> 40:43.307
Come on.

40:44.975 --> 40:45.976
Yeah.

40:56.654 --> 40:59.406
You forgot the one most important thing
I taught you, Mace.

41:00.115 --> 41:01.116
Never lie to me.

41:02.534 --> 41:05.704
You just texted your witness
Rina Kimura 911 to bug out.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.500
I didn't forget.

41:11.293 --> 41:12.252
Why, Paul?

41:14.421 --> 41:16.006
Let's see.

41:16.715 --> 41:19.093
The public gave up
on guys like us, Mace.

41:19.176 --> 41:20.260
So I gave up on them.

41:23.764 --> 41:26.850
You say it enough,
it starts to sound like the truth.

41:28.310 --> 41:29.603
It's the money, isn't it?

41:30.437 --> 41:32.314
Now you may not want
to admit it, Mace.

41:33.982 --> 41:35.484
But there is a game here.

41:36.443 --> 41:39.154
- You make a play or you get played.

41:49.289 --> 41:53.836
A common man
with uncommon desire to succeed.

41:55.754 --> 41:59.091
Now you sit your save-a-hoe
fixated ass court-side,

41:59.174 --> 42:01.009
and you watch me play.

42:02.845 --> 42:05.347
He was on to us. Go ahead.

42:09.268 --> 42:10.269
Aww!

42:10.352 --> 42:14.314
Don't look so heartbroken, sweetheart.
I'll make it better.

42:14.398 --> 42:16.734
You burned down the whole program
just to flush out one witness?

42:16.817 --> 42:20.696
That bitch stole something
on her way out of her gilded cage.

42:20.779 --> 42:24.575
Something the Syndicate will pay
a shit ton of money to get back.

42:24.658 --> 42:27.202
After, of course, we bury her for real.

42:27.286 --> 42:30.539
And the only way Rina Kimura gets back
into the U.S. is in a body bag.

42:30.622 --> 42:31.832
You son of a bitch.

42:31.915 --> 42:33.625
You told the Syndicate
she's still alive.

42:33.709 --> 42:36.670
Come on. She was never going to testify.

42:36.754 --> 42:38.714
You must have had a hunch.

42:38.797 --> 42:41.592
Why protect someone who's using you?

42:42.092 --> 42:43.010
Huh?

42:44.678 --> 42:45.596
Ah!

42:46.722 --> 42:47.765
You like her.

42:49.183 --> 42:51.310
- He caught feelings.
- Shut the f...

42:51.393 --> 42:53.520
No, you shut the fuck up, Mace.

42:55.981 --> 42:57.024
You see,

42:58.066 --> 43:00.444
that scares you.
You don't know what to do with that.

43:01.737 --> 43:03.280
There's something I can never teach you.

43:03.363 --> 43:05.616
- What's that?
- Not to care so damn much.

43:06.533 --> 43:08.160
About the job, your witnesses.

43:08.243 --> 43:10.913
When you erase someone,
you start a relationship.

43:11.413 --> 43:14.333
And you're okay
as long as you get to play God.

43:14.750 --> 43:15.876
In control.

43:16.335 --> 43:19.838
But making a real relationship work,
an equal one...

43:20.798 --> 43:23.884
You see, that never was
your jam, was it, Mace?

43:25.219 --> 43:26.220
You ever had one?

43:27.346 --> 43:29.807
- Other than with me, and your abs?

43:32.810 --> 43:33.977
Tell me where she is.

43:34.770 --> 43:36.021
We part ways...

43:36.563 --> 43:39.858
and you can go back to playing a hero
for escorts and criminals.

43:41.109 --> 43:42.319
Too late, Paul.

43:43.195 --> 43:44.279
You crossed the line.

43:50.369 --> 43:52.204
There is no line anymore.

43:52.704 --> 43:53.997
I erased it!

43:55.207 --> 43:56.750
Now you tell me where the fuck she is.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.670
He deleted the 911 he sent to Kimura.

44:00.128 --> 44:02.464
- I set a trap and trace.
- Atta boy, Mikey.

44:03.590 --> 44:04.633
You know what?

44:05.676 --> 44:08.345
I think I'm going
to call him "Mason 2.0."

44:09.805 --> 44:12.349
- Location?
- NSA is locked on her cell,

44:12.432 --> 44:14.226
tracking it for us in real-time.

44:15.978 --> 44:17.187
Inform our contact.

44:23.277 --> 44:24.820
How much are they paying you?

44:26.530 --> 44:27.781
Take note, Oltcheck.

44:28.490 --> 44:32.077
He's just trying to distract us
as he figures out a way to escape.

44:32.411 --> 44:33.412
Noted.

44:33.495 --> 44:34.705
Finder's fee.

44:35.455 --> 44:38.333
One for the girl, one for the wallet.
Get them both.

44:38.417 --> 44:40.460
Beats babysitting scum for peanuts.

44:41.420 --> 44:44.089
You wouldn't be telling me this
unless you planned on killing me.

44:44.172 --> 44:46.300
Ding! Ding! That is the plan.

44:47.593 --> 44:50.095
But only once I get the girl,
and I'm sure I'm getting paid.

44:50.178 --> 44:51.221
Paul...

44:52.264 --> 44:54.308
you made a deal with the Syndicate.

44:54.766 --> 44:55.976
Make one with me.

44:57.895 --> 44:59.438
Come on, you can do better than that.

45:00.439 --> 45:02.608
What can you offer me, hmm?

45:04.192 --> 45:05.235
Your life.

45:06.361 --> 45:07.404
This guy...

45:08.405 --> 45:09.406
Oltcheck,

45:10.032 --> 45:13.160
I'll make things right with the locals.
Smooth the situation.

45:13.535 --> 45:15.746
You take this one to our vehicle,

45:16.455 --> 45:17.831
if you think you can handle that.

45:18.040 --> 45:18.999
Copy.

45:19.416 --> 45:20.751
- Move.
- Paul.

45:21.084 --> 45:22.002
Move.

46:00.958 --> 46:01.917
Rina!

47:12.446 --> 47:14.614
I need to know exactly
what happened here, Paul.

47:14.698 --> 47:16.950
What are you talking about?
The evidence is on the floor.

47:18.493 --> 47:20.328
Your plan to flush out my witness,

47:21.371 --> 47:22.581
pretty risky, Oltcheck.

47:22.664 --> 47:23.582
Shut up.

47:24.499 --> 47:25.876
What's your cut?

47:25.959 --> 47:28.253
Can't think Paul's
gonna let you live to see it.

47:28.336 --> 47:30.380
He chose me for a reason, Pollard.

47:30.464 --> 47:33.175
- You really are stupid, aren't you?
- I said shut the fuck up!

47:34.926 --> 47:37.137
You know, you're right about Paul.
He is a legend.

47:37.846 --> 47:39.973
The first thing he taught me,
improvisation...

47:40.057 --> 47:41.516
Is the art of field work.

47:48.648 --> 47:50.442
Sounds like some bullshit.

47:51.151 --> 47:52.277
I better go.

47:52.360 --> 47:53.403
You do that.

48:46.248 --> 48:47.499
Move! Move! Move!

49:02.389 --> 49:03.890
Don't fucking move!

49:11.857 --> 49:12.816
Think you're Whitlock, huh?

49:15.610 --> 49:16.570
You sure about that, Deputy?

49:20.657 --> 49:21.575
No.

49:37.215 --> 49:38.175
Good luck, Deputy.

50:17.214 --> 50:18.173
Come on, bro.

50:19.216 --> 50:20.217
Paul, he, uh...

50:22.010 --> 50:23.220
I'm sorry.

50:25.639 --> 50:28.391
- On the edge of the world here, Mikey...

50:28.600 --> 50:29.809
you Screw up...

50:30.393 --> 50:31.311
you fall off.

50:34.606 --> 50:35.482
Please.

50:36.733 --> 50:37.984
- Please, Paul.

50:54.584 --> 50:55.585
Rina!

50:58.588 --> 51:01.800
Give me the cold wallet
and I'll spare your life.

51:06.263 --> 51:08.265
For fuck's sake! Rina!

51:18.358 --> 51:19.818
- Stop the car.

51:19.901 --> 51:21.403
Easy, easy. Don't shoot, ese!

51:21.486 --> 51:22.445
Marco Where is she?

51:24.489 --> 51:25.407
Rina?

51:46.011 --> 51:47.429
Come here, little mouse.

51:51.808 --> 51:53.018
She tricked me.

51:54.144 --> 51:55.145
I lost her.

51:55.228 --> 51:58.023
My guy hit us
with a mean crossover, too.

51:59.816 --> 52:00.734
The fuck?

52:01.985 --> 52:03.153
Kon'nichiwal

52:05.280 --> 52:07.324
in English Your men, poachers...

52:08.616 --> 52:09.868
trust them?

52:09.951 --> 52:12.120
Business associates. We go way back.

52:13.872 --> 52:15.874
Had side deals down here for years.

52:15.957 --> 52:17.250
They need investors.

52:18.084 --> 52:19.961
The council will be interested.

52:20.045 --> 52:21.546
It's an easy way to do your laundry.

52:21.921 --> 52:23.465
One thing at a time, Whitlock.

52:26.718 --> 52:27.719
My price just went up.

52:28.928 --> 52:30.930
I want the wallet, too.
Payment for the girl.

52:31.222 --> 52:33.433
- That wasn't our deal.
- I'm changing it.

52:33.516 --> 52:37.354
This is getting complicated,
expensive. Stupid.

52:41.066 --> 52:42.609
I need to talk to my people.

52:42.901 --> 52:44.027
You do that.

52:46.821 --> 52:48.531
How do we find them?

52:48.615 --> 52:51.493
Pollard blocked Rina Kimura's face,
her biometrics and his own

52:51.576 --> 52:55.163
from the CCTV network
that covers this entire city,

52:55.246 --> 52:57.207
like steam on shit.

52:59.125 --> 53:00.210
But...

53:00.293 --> 53:01.795
You unblocked them,
so they could be tracked.

53:02.754 --> 53:04.923
- Yes, sir.
- They don't realize it?

53:05.673 --> 53:09.219
Pollard will fetch Kimura,
who'll be in a safe house.

53:09.677 --> 53:12.389
After that... sayonara.

53:12.472 --> 53:13.973
Did I say I was fucking Japanese?

53:14.057 --> 53:15.725
Do I look like I give a fuck?

53:21.773 --> 53:22.857
Do we have a deal?

53:24.609 --> 53:25.693
You bet.

53:26.945 --> 53:27.862
Let's go.

54:48.693 --> 54:50.820
- Oh, my God!

55:02.832 --> 55:05.919
Okay. Yeah. This way. This way.

55:06.461 --> 55:09.172
Not this way. Not this way!

55:12.717 --> 55:13.676
Back off!

55:17.847 --> 55:21.309
- Go! Get out of here!
- Hey. Easy, easy, easy. Hey.

55:21.851 --> 55:23.520
How you doing?
You being a pain?

55:23.895 --> 55:27.815
Come on. This way. Come on.
Come on. Good girl. Good.

55:27.899 --> 55:29.817
- No.
- Come on. Away from her.

55:30.276 --> 55:33.029
Come on. Come on. This way.

55:33.238 --> 55:34.739
Come on. Come on.

55:40.036 --> 55:42.789
So you met Janice, huh?
She's just scared.

55:43.623 --> 55:45.750
"She's scared." She's scared?

55:48.419 --> 55:49.462
What happened?

55:49.921 --> 55:51.631
I ran into an old friend.

55:52.715 --> 55:55.635
Me too. Mine nearly killed me.

55:59.764 --> 56:00.974
This is your place?

56:02.225 --> 56:03.685
It's an old tourist farm.

56:04.352 --> 56:07.355
I bought it, and let the animals go.

56:08.022 --> 56:09.357
Some of them stayed.

56:15.029 --> 56:16.030
Hey.

56:17.699 --> 56:19.284
I got it, okay?

56:19.951 --> 56:20.952
Hold on.

56:29.252 --> 56:30.253
Nail.

56:38.428 --> 56:39.470
Thank you.

56:54.485 --> 56:57.697
Why are we here?
I mean, what went wrong?

57:01.200 --> 57:02.368
Deputy Whitlock.

57:05.371 --> 57:06.331
Paul.

57:08.041 --> 57:09.792
He was my closest friend.

57:12.295 --> 57:13.463
A mentor.

57:14.922 --> 57:15.882
He turned.

57:17.050 --> 57:20.011
He's here in Cape Town
to kill you for the Syndicate.

57:21.804 --> 57:22.889
He sold out.

57:24.682 --> 57:26.351
And I never saw it coming.

57:27.644 --> 57:29.062
That's how Marco found me.

57:29.646 --> 57:30.605
Marco?

57:31.981 --> 57:34.275
An enforcer for the Syndicate.

57:35.276 --> 57:36.444
My old friend.

57:36.986 --> 57:39.530
He tried to kill me
right after you sent the 911.

57:41.366 --> 57:44.118
Whitlock gave Marco
your cell phone location and tracked it,

57:45.036 --> 57:46.663
with the help of Uncle Sam,

57:48.498 --> 57:49.540
and me.

57:53.711 --> 57:55.630
Our old friends are new friends.

58:03.096 --> 58:04.931
Agent Galloway has updates.

58:05.348 --> 58:06.224
Go.

58:06.432 --> 58:08.976
We caught a break off the CCTV network.

58:09.352 --> 58:11.813
A man on foot
matching Pollard's description.

58:12.230 --> 58:13.773
We're Sat tracking him now

58:13.898 --> 58:16.275
and I've issued a warrant
for his arrest.

58:16.567 --> 58:18.194
En route now, Marshal Rhodes.

58:18.986 --> 58:20.446
With some local backup.

58:20.655 --> 58:23.366
The Mason Pollard I know
would never do this.

58:23.449 --> 58:24.951
Something we missed?

58:25.868 --> 58:27.870
Program means everything to him.

58:28.830 --> 58:29.956
That's all he's got.

58:30.998 --> 58:33.793
Something very serious
must have happened.

58:35.002 --> 58:36.921
He keeps it all inside.

58:37.755 --> 58:40.675
- Bring him in alive.
- Understood.

58:41.843 --> 58:42.927
Good work, Galloway.

58:43.553 --> 58:44.470
Good luck.

58:46.389 --> 58:47.432
Game time.

59:25.887 --> 59:27.054
Who's Bud?

59:29.515 --> 59:32.268
Someone who never got
the second chance you're getting now.

59:32.852 --> 59:34.187
I deserve more than that.

59:35.730 --> 59:36.814
Do you?

59:42.403 --> 59:45.490
The cold wallet you stole, where is it?

59:46.824 --> 59:47.825
The what?

59:48.785 --> 59:50.620
You were never gonna testify, were you?

59:51.537 --> 59:54.540
You just needed a passport
so you could escape.

59:55.041 --> 59:59.003
Cash out, take off,
no matter who got hurt or killed.

59:59.086 --> 1:00:00.755
Okay, I never used the wallet.

1:00:01.464 --> 1:00:02.799
I knew they'd trace it if I tried.

1:00:04.008 --> 1:00:04.967
Where is it?

1:00:06.344 --> 1:00:08.971
Back at Rachel's house. I hid it.

1:00:20.983 --> 1:00:22.151
Okay. I'm sorry.

1:00:22.443 --> 1:00:24.445
I've had to lie my whole life.
It's hard for me to stop.

1:00:24.529 --> 1:00:25.613
Save it.

1:00:28.199 --> 1:00:30.993
I've heard about these,
for cryptocurrency.

1:00:32.328 --> 1:00:34.205
Unhackable, offline...

1:00:34.288 --> 1:00:35.206
Cold.

1:00:36.874 --> 1:00:38.292
Kosta used it for bribes.

1:00:38.626 --> 1:00:39.710
Polycarbonate.

1:00:39.961 --> 1:00:42.547
Looks like metal. This is how
you got it through airport security?

1:00:44.632 --> 1:00:45.883
How much is on this thing?

1:00:46.217 --> 1:00:49.929
I don't know yet. I swear.
I haven't had a chance to check.

1:00:55.601 --> 1:00:56.644
Seedcode.

1:00:56.894 --> 1:00:59.856
It's 24 words Kosta chose.
Impossible to hack.

1:01:00.356 --> 1:01:02.900
Cold wallet's like a locked mailbox.

1:01:03.067 --> 1:01:05.027
Cash can't go in or out without a key.

1:01:05.361 --> 1:01:07.154
And you deleted the seedcode.

1:01:08.197 --> 1:01:09.949
I thought it'd be an insurance policy.

1:01:10.658 --> 1:01:13.452
- Keep them from killing me.
- Till after they torture you, Rina.

1:01:15.580 --> 1:01:17.164
How could someone access this money?

1:01:17.582 --> 1:01:20.334
I need a secure network, very secure.

1:01:21.043 --> 1:01:23.337
The 24 words, where are they now?

1:01:26.132 --> 1:01:27.216
Jesus.

1:01:27.633 --> 1:01:29.844
The seedcode, the words,
write them down, now.

1:01:29.927 --> 1:01:31.429
I need that money to start over.

1:01:31.512 --> 1:01:33.139
Then try earning it, Rina.

1:01:34.098 --> 1:01:36.559
Really? Get fucking real.

1:01:37.101 --> 1:01:38.728
It is all about the money.

1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:41.772
Kosta, Marco, Paul Whitlock.

1:01:42.023 --> 1:01:44.150
You wanna be like those people?

1:01:46.110 --> 1:01:48.070
Everybody is like them.

1:01:48.738 --> 1:01:52.700
Okay, this world is one big lying,
corrupt nightmare.

1:01:52.783 --> 1:01:54.994
- Not the whole world.
- Most people.

1:01:56.370 --> 1:01:58.331
And most of you.

1:01:59.290 --> 1:02:01.792
Nobody hates a bad cop
more than a good cop.

1:02:02.293 --> 1:02:03.377
Nobody.

1:02:04.170 --> 1:02:05.630
But you don't see that, do you?

1:02:06.380 --> 1:02:08.841
You just lump us all in together,
say you want to get rid of us

1:02:08.925 --> 1:02:10.217
when all we really want

1:02:10.927 --> 1:02:14.013
is to take down the bad guys
and to keep you safe.

1:02:15.514 --> 1:02:18.476
I don't want to get rid of you, okay?

1:02:18.559 --> 1:02:21.145
I just want you to treat me
like a human being.

1:02:29.779 --> 1:02:30.738
digital beeping

1:02:36.786 --> 1:02:38.746
I never meant for anyone
to get hurt, Pollard.

1:02:39.705 --> 1:02:41.248
And I won't lie to you again.

1:02:42.416 --> 1:02:43.417
I promise.

1:02:48.589 --> 1:02:49.632
You know how to use this?

1:02:51.425 --> 1:02:53.260
- Yeah.
- Raise your hand.

1:02:55.680 --> 1:02:58.349
Do you swear to protect and defend
the United States Constitution

1:02:58.432 --> 1:03:00.476
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic?

1:03:01.811 --> 1:03:02.895
I do.

1:03:03.521 --> 1:03:05.731
Good. Put your hand down.

1:03:08.609 --> 1:03:11.237
Because our old friends got here
61 seconds ago.

1:03:13.698 --> 1:03:14.949
Move your ass, Deputy.

1:03:37.054 --> 1:03:38.055
Ah-ah-ah.

1:03:40.516 --> 1:03:42.727
It's a distraction. We're wasting ammo.

1:03:50.401 --> 1:03:51.527
Easy now.

1:03:56.615 --> 1:03:57.825
Talon, you take left!

1:03:58.159 --> 1:03:59.326
Kudo, you take right.

1:04:00.202 --> 1:04:01.829
He'll have an egress.

1:04:02.913 --> 1:04:04.373
Where are you, Mace?

1:04:05.624 --> 1:04:06.834
Can't be far.

1:04:14.842 --> 1:04:17.094
Ah, there you are. Predictable.

1:04:17.636 --> 1:04:18.596
Grenade launcher.

1:04:29.565 --> 1:04:30.691
Leggo.

1:04:32.068 --> 1:04:32.985
Mason Come on.

1:04:53.005 --> 1:04:53.881
Move. Move!

1:05:14.985 --> 1:05:15.861
You okay?

1:05:26.455 --> 1:05:27.456
Move! Move! Move!

1:05:50.813 --> 1:05:51.981
Where are you?

1:05:54.275 --> 1:05:55.693
Keep your eyes open now.

1:05:56.193 --> 1:05:57.153
Pollard.

1:05:58.112 --> 1:06:00.197
Pollard. What are you doing?

1:06:00.739 --> 1:06:02.283
I'm just looking for a friend.

1:06:04.410 --> 1:06:05.369
Shit!

1:06:06.328 --> 1:06:07.413
Good boy.

1:06:08.455 --> 1:06:09.415
Atta boy.

1:06:10.916 --> 1:06:13.043
Hey, no! Alfie, no!

1:06:14.879 --> 1:06:16.213
Don't give me that shit.

1:06:21.468 --> 1:06:22.970
Strode, to my right.

1:06:27.183 --> 1:06:28.726
As fast as you can, okay?

1:06:41.614 --> 1:06:44.909
I see them. I got them. On my lead.

1:06:52.166 --> 1:06:53.459
- They're mine.
- Mine.

1:07:00.424 --> 1:07:01.425
Fuck, man!

1:07:02.801 --> 1:07:03.802
Shit!

1:07:20.152 --> 1:07:22.404
Move out. Move!

1:08:09.660 --> 1:08:11.245
The Sugar Shack opens in an hour.

1:08:11.328 --> 1:08:12.997
Smileys aren't ready yet.

1:08:13.831 --> 1:08:18.919
Sugar Shack. You couldn't have
come up with a better name, Sugar?

1:08:21.714 --> 1:08:23.424
I see it, but I don't believe it.

1:08:24.300 --> 1:08:27.094
Pollard, I swear I never broke cover.

1:08:27.678 --> 1:08:29.096
Bru, this is the guy.

1:08:30.139 --> 1:08:32.766
Man! You're the one who send
us this doos.

1:08:33.350 --> 1:08:34.435
Doos?

1:08:34.518 --> 1:08:36.854
That means, like, fool, jackass.

1:08:36.937 --> 1:08:38.647
- Okay, hey...
- You pick. Come on.

1:08:39.440 --> 1:08:41.692
Look, if you're asking for me
to take him back, I'm sorry.

1:08:41.775 --> 1:08:42.860
All sales are final.

1:08:43.277 --> 1:08:45.112
Nah, it's lekker.

1:08:45.195 --> 1:08:46.280
We'll keep him.

1:08:46.363 --> 1:08:47.364
"Lekker?"

1:08:47.614 --> 1:08:48.741
It means "good."

1:08:50.784 --> 1:08:51.702
Wait.

1:08:52.703 --> 1:08:53.579
She's with you?

1:08:54.246 --> 1:08:55.748
You look so surprised.

1:08:56.332 --> 1:08:58.792
Well, this one don't cross the line.

1:08:59.543 --> 1:09:03.255
Do pleasure. So you must be business.

1:09:04.214 --> 1:09:05.924
She just joined the club, Sugar.

1:09:06.717 --> 1:09:07.926
She needs your help.

1:09:09.511 --> 1:09:10.596
I need your help.

1:09:12.514 --> 1:09:16.143
You sprung me out of a coffin,
gave me everything,

1:09:16.226 --> 1:09:19.271
my own legit business
in the middle of paradise.

1:09:19.355 --> 1:09:21.982
Whatever you need, bro,
we're here for you.

1:09:24.234 --> 1:09:25.235
We got you.

1:09:25.611 --> 1:09:26.945
That means don't worry.

1:09:28.322 --> 1:09:29.490
Lekker.

1:09:30.115 --> 1:09:32.326
An! I like her.

1:09:36.538 --> 1:09:39.708
Why are you changing your mind?
Letting me go for the money?

1:09:41.210 --> 1:09:42.753
If I can't protect you
from my own people,

1:09:42.836 --> 1:09:45.964
you deserve to get what you can
when you can.

1:09:47.007 --> 1:09:48.550
You surprise me, Pollard.

1:09:48.634 --> 1:09:50.010
I surprise myself.

1:09:51.428 --> 1:09:54.264
Need your game face, Deputy.
Don't get overexcited.

1:09:55.766 --> 1:09:58.018
Paul, you were right.

1:09:59.311 --> 1:10:01.480
They showed up
at a financial institution.

1:10:02.231 --> 1:10:03.565
Good girl.

1:10:23.502 --> 1:10:24.586
Can I help you people?

1:10:24.670 --> 1:10:28.257
Yeah, you can keep this area clear
while my associate lays down some cloth.

1:10:28.340 --> 1:10:29.508
I mean, what are you doing here?

1:10:29.967 --> 1:10:32.261
You know, just some touch up work.

1:10:32.803 --> 1:10:34.680
Somebody called it in. Hold on.

1:10:34.763 --> 1:10:36.515
I have a name for you
right over here with me.

1:10:38.475 --> 1:10:39.852
Can you sort it out?

1:10:40.644 --> 1:10:41.728
Just...

1:10:43.272 --> 1:10:45.441
I am so sorry to keep you waiting.

1:10:47.192 --> 1:10:49.528
So Mister and Miss...

1:10:49.611 --> 1:10:50.654
Bobotie.

1:10:50.737 --> 1:10:53.532
Robyn and Ernie Bobotie.

1:10:54.783 --> 1:10:56.285
And what brings you in today?

1:10:56.869 --> 1:10:58.704
We need a loan, as fast as you can.

1:10:59.037 --> 1:11:00.747
I'm expecting.

1:11:02.416 --> 1:11:03.333
Expecting?

1:11:03.667 --> 1:11:05.002
A child, umm...

1:11:05.836 --> 1:11:06.712
Baby.

1:11:08.005 --> 1:11:09.047
Yes.

1:11:11.425 --> 1:11:13.010
Congrats. Exciting.

1:11:13.093 --> 1:11:14.386
What are today's rates?

1:11:15.262 --> 1:11:18.974
Yes, well, we can offer you

1:11:19.057 --> 1:11:21.018
some of the most competitive rates
in the market.

1:11:22.102 --> 1:11:24.271
Mr. Chetty, can you
come to the lobby floor?

1:11:24.354 --> 1:11:25.397
We need you.

1:11:27.941 --> 1:11:29.026
Could you excuse me a minute?

1:11:29.902 --> 1:11:30.861
Of course.

1:11:37.159 --> 1:11:38.118
Ernie?

1:11:41.246 --> 1:11:42.080
Nice.

1:11:42.164 --> 1:11:46.418
Just a little misunderstanding.
This is your name on the request, yeah?

1:11:46.502 --> 1:11:48.921
No. No, this is a mistake.

1:11:49.004 --> 1:11:51.590
Okay? You need to take all of this stuff
out of here at once, okay?

1:11:51.673 --> 1:11:53.050
I have customers.

1:11:53.133 --> 1:11:54.676
Customers upstairs who are waiting.

1:11:54.760 --> 1:11:56.136
He has customers.

1:11:56.220 --> 1:11:57.679
Okay.

1:12:03.977 --> 1:12:04.978
Sorry.

1:12:05.979 --> 1:12:08.815
- You gosh damn imbecile!
- Excuse.

1:12:08.899 --> 1:12:10.651
- Clean it up right now before it sets.
- Yeah.

1:12:11.235 --> 1:12:13.070
I am so sorry for the floor, sir.

1:12:13.153 --> 1:12:14.112
Got you.

1:12:14.446 --> 1:12:16.198
Don't move, bro. You're making it worse.

1:12:16.698 --> 1:12:17.699
Quickly now.

1:12:23.956 --> 1:12:24.998
Gap.

1:12:27.834 --> 1:12:29.211
He just logged in. Where are you?

1:12:29.545 --> 1:12:30.796
Very close.

1:12:33.840 --> 1:12:35.926
Vault. South.

1:12:38.720 --> 1:12:41.014
Wow. That's more than I ever...

1:12:41.098 --> 1:12:42.140
Impressive.

1:12:42.558 --> 1:12:45.852
Like I said, financial planning.

1:12:45.936 --> 1:12:48.105
- You'll be fine. Sorry.
- Jesus.

1:12:49.648 --> 1:12:52.568
There's more on...
Just my shoes. My shoes. Take it.

1:12:52.651 --> 1:12:54.861
- So let me just...
- I can smell it. I can smell it.

1:12:54.945 --> 1:12:56.280
- This is really bad.

1:12:56.363 --> 1:12:57.322
Just...

1:13:03.912 --> 1:13:05.080
Funds not available.

1:13:05.455 --> 1:13:06.415
Whitlock.

1:13:08.000 --> 1:13:09.209
They were waiting for this.

1:13:14.381 --> 1:13:15.841
I see you, Mace.

1:13:15.924 --> 1:13:17.134
Watch out, big foot. Wet paint.

1:13:17.217 --> 1:13:19.094
- Hey, don't fuck with me.
- Okay, listen up.

1:13:21.054 --> 1:13:22.264
Looking for these two.

1:13:26.310 --> 1:13:27.269
Are you joking?

1:13:27.686 --> 1:13:29.771
Couldn't hack the wallet,
so they got into my DAX Fiat account.

1:13:30.439 --> 1:13:31.440
Where did the money go?

1:13:33.108 --> 1:13:34.484
Ocean Trace International?

1:13:35.277 --> 1:13:36.403
Whitlock's on a task force.

1:13:36.486 --> 1:13:38.155
He's been investigating
Ocean Trace for years.

1:13:38.238 --> 1:13:42.618
It's a shipping company here with ties
to the black market, endangered animals.

1:13:42.701 --> 1:13:43.827
They're poachers, Rina.

1:13:44.953 --> 1:13:47.414
I just paid Ocean Trace $30 million.

1:13:48.999 --> 1:13:49.958
Little man,

1:13:51.460 --> 1:13:52.419
where are they?

1:13:53.587 --> 1:13:55.339
In my office, up the stairs to the left.

1:13:55.797 --> 1:13:57.382
Galloway, cover this exit.

1:13:57.466 --> 1:13:58.884
You, there.

1:14:01.053 --> 1:14:02.846
All of you, don't move.

1:14:08.977 --> 1:14:11.104
Atta boy, Sugar. Come on, we gotta go.

1:14:12.189 --> 1:14:13.523
I said don't move.

1:14:19.988 --> 1:14:21.573
Marco, come up from the garage.

1:14:28.413 --> 1:14:29.706
Don't move.

1:14:54.773 --> 1:14:56.191
Come on, Miss Kimura.

1:14:56.274 --> 1:14:58.819
Mason clearly can't keep you safe.

1:14:59.319 --> 1:15:00.737
You're gonna keep playing with junior?

1:15:01.363 --> 1:15:02.698
Or you wanna take a bet on big papa?

1:15:08.787 --> 1:15:11.415
Mace, listen to me.

1:15:11.998 --> 1:15:13.041
Give her up.

1:15:14.167 --> 1:15:16.002
It's the only way
she walks out of here alive.

1:15:25.470 --> 1:15:26.596
Miss Kimura,

1:15:28.056 --> 1:15:30.559
Mason ever tell you
the sad story about Bud?

1:15:33.687 --> 1:15:35.939
Did he try to win you over
with it, Ms. Kimura?

1:15:36.022 --> 1:15:37.899
Try to get some of that git gud?

1:15:43.447 --> 1:15:44.364
Mason.

1:15:46.533 --> 1:15:47.909
I can make it.

1:15:48.618 --> 1:15:50.245
Over there, the fire escape.

1:15:54.624 --> 1:15:56.710
- You go.
- Then you go.

1:15:57.294 --> 1:15:58.211
Go.

1:16:03.550 --> 1:16:04.843
Watch out, bro.

1:16:06.595 --> 1:16:07.554
Rina!

1:16:13.727 --> 1:16:15.187
Gun, now.

1:16:27.908 --> 1:16:29.201
What the hell is going on here, Paul?

1:16:32.370 --> 1:16:33.371
Thanks for your help, honey.

1:16:45.801 --> 1:16:46.843
Mace?

1:17:17.749 --> 1:17:18.708
Watch out!

1:17:29.052 --> 1:17:30.762
Yo, Pollard, get in, bro.

1:17:41.106 --> 1:17:44.526
When I said this could go sideways,
Mason, I never thought it'd be you.

1:17:44.609 --> 1:17:46.987
They say you killed Oltcheck,
with his own weapon.

1:17:47.070 --> 1:17:48.613
Whitlock's gone rogue.

1:17:48.697 --> 1:17:50.407
He killed his own witness
to get to mine.

1:17:51.324 --> 1:17:53.994
Was Rina Kimura
in possession of stolen evidence?

1:17:54.077 --> 1:17:55.787
- Yes, but...
- I've got the FBI with me.

1:17:55.871 --> 1:17:57.455
We'll take Kimura in ourselves.

1:17:57.539 --> 1:17:58.915
I can't let you do that.

1:17:58.999 --> 1:18:01.293
I need your badge, Pollard.

1:18:07.048 --> 1:18:08.592
Who wants an Umqgombothi?

1:18:17.976 --> 1:18:21.813
Ocean Trace has a ship in port
leaving tonight. Usual cargo.

1:18:22.397 --> 1:18:25.025
If I ever come face to face
with those poachers,

1:18:25.108 --> 1:18:27.152
I will rock up and donner the dwankies.

1:18:27.235 --> 1:18:28.737
- Yebo.
- Ja.

1:18:36.953 --> 1:18:38.955
in English
Okay. So, what do we do?

1:18:41.207 --> 1:18:42.250
Pollard.

1:18:45.712 --> 1:18:46.796
Shit, bro.

1:18:47.172 --> 1:18:49.424
If you don't like the music,
just turn that shit off.

1:18:55.388 --> 1:18:56.681
Anything I do...

1:18:57.974 --> 1:18:59.267
Whitlock will be waiting.

1:19:00.185 --> 1:19:01.394
And then he'll kill her.

1:19:05.065 --> 1:19:06.691
'N boer maak 'n plan.

1:19:07.192 --> 1:19:08.234
What?

1:19:09.110 --> 1:19:12.072
The first thing this country
and its great people taught me.

1:19:12.739 --> 1:19:14.282
After you dropped me here,

1:19:14.366 --> 1:19:16.785
I was lost, ready to give up.

1:19:17.577 --> 1:19:19.621
'N boer maak 'n plan.

1:19:19.704 --> 1:19:21.414
"A farmer makes a plan."

1:19:22.374 --> 1:19:24.542
In other words, figure it out.

1:19:25.919 --> 1:19:28.296
- I'm no farmer.
- And you have no plan.

1:19:28.380 --> 1:19:29.381
So make one.

1:19:30.131 --> 1:19:31.383
Or you're gonna sit
on your sad little ass

1:19:31.466 --> 1:19:33.176
crying like a goddamn toddler?

1:19:34.636 --> 1:19:36.388
Why the fuck did I save you?

1:19:36.846 --> 1:19:38.890
I don't know, bro. You love me?

1:20:03.498 --> 1:20:04.708
Rina.

1:20:13.925 --> 1:20:15.427
Marco, let me go.

1:20:18.096 --> 1:20:20.432
I mean, we can start over somewhere.

1:20:21.016 --> 1:20:21.933
Yeah?

1:20:24.936 --> 1:20:26.146
Where you're going,

1:20:27.522 --> 1:20:28.606
you'll fetch a good price.

1:20:31.526 --> 1:20:32.861
You two have that in common.

1:20:34.612 --> 1:20:36.114
Don't do this.

1:20:37.949 --> 1:20:39.534
If you truly care for me,

1:20:40.618 --> 1:20:41.578
let me go.

1:20:42.912 --> 1:20:43.788
Yeah.

1:20:43.872 --> 1:20:46.458
And someday, we can be together.

1:20:46.875 --> 1:20:48.084
You and I.

1:20:51.713 --> 1:20:53.173
Not in this lifetime.

1:21:03.475 --> 1:21:04.601
Fuck you.

1:21:42.972 --> 1:21:45.183
Marshal Rhodes, it's me.

1:21:46.476 --> 1:21:47.644
Just listen.

1:21:48.186 --> 1:21:49.813
I have evidence against Whitlock.

1:21:50.313 --> 1:21:52.440
Dock 45, Cape Town Port Annex.

1:21:55.401 --> 1:21:56.528
You want me, boss?

1:21:58.029 --> 1:21:59.114
Come get me.

1:21:59.364 --> 1:22:01.032
Pollard, you're in deep shit.

1:22:03.284 --> 1:22:05.203
Last chance to back out, bros.

1:22:05.286 --> 1:22:06.329
No way, bruh.

1:22:06.579 --> 1:22:09.457
You brought me to paradise,
I ain't letting it get stepped on.

1:22:09.916 --> 1:22:11.918
Yeah. Fuck that shit.

1:22:12.252 --> 1:22:13.294
Yebo.

1:22:16.506 --> 1:22:18.550
Hey, listen up.

1:22:19.008 --> 1:22:21.678
Keep your heads on a swivel
and your assholes puckered.

1:22:22.762 --> 1:22:24.180
Son of a bitch is out there.

1:22:34.774 --> 1:22:35.942
There's a new investment.

1:22:36.401 --> 1:22:37.402
Yeah.

1:22:37.735 --> 1:22:39.612
The council has awarded you
too generously.

1:22:40.280 --> 1:22:41.656
That was our deal.

1:22:41.739 --> 1:22:43.575
I deliver the girl,
I get the cold wallet.

1:22:43.658 --> 1:22:45.326
And I do whatever the fuck
I want with it.

1:22:45.910 --> 1:22:49.205
See, I'm turning your 30 million
into my 60.

1:22:49.539 --> 1:22:52.167
Maybe more, depending how much I get
for that preggo black rhino.

1:22:52.792 --> 1:22:56.421
Spinning shit into gold,
it's the American way.

1:22:59.674 --> 1:23:01.134
Getting to it.

1:23:02.427 --> 1:23:04.888
Sweet thing. Ayo.

1:23:14.480 --> 1:23:16.232
What's up, boys? Who ordered the dinner?

1:23:16.316 --> 1:23:17.525
Restricted area, buddy.

1:23:17.692 --> 1:23:18.651
Just wait there.

1:23:18.735 --> 1:23:19.611
Hold on.

1:23:19.694 --> 1:23:21.654
We got an order of smileys
off the braai.

1:23:22.780 --> 1:23:24.449
They are very nutritious, my friend.

1:23:24.532 --> 1:23:26.910
- You're going to love it.
- Who's the idiot that got take out?

1:23:30.246 --> 1:23:31.206
Hey.

1:23:32.040 --> 1:23:33.166
Check those two junkers.

1:23:36.169 --> 1:23:38.838
Take a smell. Smell it.
You want to smell this. It's so good.

1:23:38.963 --> 1:23:40.924
- Stand back.
- Hey!

1:23:46.554 --> 1:23:47.847
He's here.

1:23:59.609 --> 1:24:00.568
Take the head.

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:17.001
Oh...

1:24:25.385 --> 1:24:26.261
Go.

1:24:34.978 --> 1:24:36.938
Get that goddamn rhino on this boat now!

1:24:53.371 --> 1:24:54.414
Find Rina.

1:24:55.248 --> 1:24:57.959
Check the containers first
and then the ship. Go now.

1:24:59.377 --> 1:25:00.420
Yebo.

1:25:54.891 --> 1:25:57.518
Go on, princess, call for him.

1:25:58.603 --> 1:26:00.772
Get his attention, get him to come.

1:26:04.942 --> 1:26:05.943
Put your hands up.

1:26:28.466 --> 1:26:29.884
Don't fucking move.

1:26:34.722 --> 1:26:35.723
Shit!

1:27:37.118 --> 1:27:39.620
Do you really think some random cop's
gonna save you, huh?

1:27:43.958 --> 1:27:45.209
Fucking bitch.

1:28:01.559 --> 1:28:02.727
- Rina!
- No!

1:28:05.938 --> 1:28:06.898
Mace!

1:28:07.690 --> 1:28:10.151
- Put the shooter down.

1:28:11.152 --> 1:28:12.028
Do it.

1:28:23.664 --> 1:28:24.540
Rina.

1:28:24.624 --> 1:28:26.209
Rina is dead!

1:28:29.337 --> 1:28:30.671
Congratulations, Jack,

1:28:31.714 --> 1:28:32.840
you've just been erased.

1:28:36.844 --> 1:28:37.845
Put the gun down.

1:28:38.304 --> 1:28:39.805
Do it, now!

1:28:42.517 --> 1:28:43.518
Move.

1:28:50.191 --> 1:28:52.735
Thank you, sweetheart.
Couldn't have done it without you.

1:28:53.694 --> 1:28:55.947
You can't out wolf
the original wolf, Mace.

1:28:59.367 --> 1:29:00.660
Take us up!

1:30:10.062 --> 1:30:11.105
Come on, baby.

1:30:27.330 --> 1:30:28.789
You thought it was gonna be that easy?

1:30:30.291 --> 1:30:31.375
I trained you better than that.

1:30:51.562 --> 1:30:52.521
I got you.

1:31:00.071 --> 1:31:01.280
Sugar, you have a shot.

1:31:01.364 --> 1:31:02.365
Shit!

1:31:02.615 --> 1:31:03.532
I'm out.

1:31:04.700 --> 1:31:06.160
You're wrong about this place, Mace.

1:31:07.620 --> 1:31:09.372
It's not paradise or prison,

1:31:10.498 --> 1:31:11.582
it's heaven or hell.

1:31:12.208 --> 1:31:13.918
- Welcome to hell.
- Hey!

1:31:19.548 --> 1:31:20.424
Go.

1:31:21.759 --> 1:31:23.260
- Hold on.
- What?

1:31:26.514 --> 1:31:27.431
Bye-bye, buddy.

1:31:28.307 --> 1:31:29.266
Bye.

1:31:36.107 --> 1:31:37.066
Shit!

1:32:03.968 --> 1:32:05.678
You can't leave me like this.

1:32:08.264 --> 1:32:09.390
Mace.

1:32:20.276 --> 1:32:22.945
Together. One, two...

1:32:27.158 --> 1:32:29.076
Mason, look out!

1:32:38.085 --> 1:32:40.045
You got me feeling and shit.

1:32:45.301 --> 1:32:46.302
Goodbye, my friend.

1:32:50.055 --> 1:32:51.348
Congratulations, Paul.

1:32:54.685 --> 1:32:55.936
You've just been erased.

1:32:58.522 --> 1:33:00.191
- Damn!

1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:21.045
Where's Whitlock?

1:33:22.087 --> 1:33:23.130
Went for a ride.

1:33:23.798 --> 1:33:24.840
Good job, Pollard.

1:33:25.049 --> 1:33:25.925
Not bad.

1:33:29.345 --> 1:33:30.554
Nice of you to join us.

1:33:36.352 --> 1:33:38.229
Couldn't have done this
without you doos.

1:33:38.729 --> 1:33:39.814
Thank you.

1:33:41.023 --> 1:33:41.982
in English We got you.

1:33:43.067 --> 1:33:44.485
Mother city, motherfuckers.

1:33:44.568 --> 1:33:45.611
Yebo.

1:33:46.111 --> 1:33:47.738
Welcome to the club, girl.

1:33:47.822 --> 1:33:49.114
Thanks, Sugar.

1:33:49.198 --> 1:33:51.283
Beers at the Sugar Shack?
What do you guys say?

1:33:51.367 --> 1:33:53.244
- No, let's go somewhere nice.
- Yebo.

1:33:53.702 --> 1:33:55.162
Let's go somewhere good.

1:34:01.836 --> 1:34:04.463
Six months after the death
of Deputy Paul Whitlock,

1:34:04.547 --> 1:34:06.048
in Cape Town, South Africa,

1:34:06.131 --> 1:34:09.635
we're here at the Federal Courthouse
in downtown Los Angeles,

1:34:09.718 --> 1:34:13.180
where the witness' testimony
led to the conviction of several

1:34:13.264 --> 1:34:15.224
high-level members of the Syndicate.

1:34:16.308 --> 1:34:18.894
So, I guess this is goodbye.

1:34:19.979 --> 1:34:20.980
Guess so.

1:34:24.108 --> 1:34:25.442
There's a little change on here.

1:34:32.199 --> 1:34:33.450
It's a lot of change.

1:34:33.784 --> 1:34:36.579
Given your service,
we want you to have it.

1:34:37.162 --> 1:34:38.497
- Legit?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:34:38.581 --> 1:34:39.582
This is for real?

1:34:40.457 --> 1:34:41.417
So is this.

1:34:49.383 --> 1:34:50.342
Robyn.

1:34:51.176 --> 1:34:52.761
Nhi Nguyen.

1:34:52.845 --> 1:34:53.888
Did I spell it right?

1:34:57.099 --> 1:34:58.017
Thank you.

1:34:58.893 --> 1:35:00.019
Check her resume.

1:35:00.561 --> 1:35:02.605
I hear she's gonna be
a financial planner.

1:35:04.565 --> 1:35:05.649
So where does she live?

1:35:06.734 --> 1:35:07.943
Anywhere she wants.

1:35:14.074 --> 1:35:16.243
Since we're never gonna
see each other again,

1:35:17.578 --> 1:35:18.621
who's Bud?

1:35:21.540 --> 1:35:22.917
Bud was my brother.

1:35:24.460 --> 1:35:27.838
Bud was a little girl called Emily
who lived down the street.

1:35:29.006 --> 1:35:32.509
Bud was Paul and I's
staff sergeant in Afghanistan.

1:35:34.219 --> 1:35:36.430
Anyone I tried to save and couldn't.

1:35:38.515 --> 1:35:40.351
I can erase people from this world,

1:35:41.143 --> 1:35:43.145
but I can't erase them
from my conscience.

1:35:45.230 --> 1:35:48.609
I'll sleep a lot better knowing
that Bud isn't you.

1:35:51.320 --> 1:35:52.404
Good luck, Robyn.

1:35:53.238 --> 1:35:54.323
You too.

1:35:55.783 --> 1:35:56.742
Jack.

1:35:57.910 --> 1:35:58.953
My name is Jack.

1:37:31.211 --> 1:37:33.505
What are you doing?

1:37:36.091 --> 1:37:37.134
Crossing a line.

1:37:54.985 --> 1:37:56.236
Didn't see that coming.
