WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:03.671
Last week on Numb3rs:

00:03.704 --> 00:04.905
CRYSTAL:
Richer or poorer, baby.

00:04.938 --> 00:08.209
DON: Pretty big career change
for a 30-year-old

00:08.242 --> 00:09.043
teacher with no priors?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.078
(pumping barrel)

00:10.111 --> 00:10.744
Crystal?

00:10.778 --> 00:12.180
CHARLIE:
You have been locked

00:12.213 --> 00:14.115
in a pursuit curve
with the killers.

00:14.148 --> 00:15.783
MEGAN:
She has crossed the threshold,

00:15.816 --> 00:17.751
and there are
no more boundaries.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.287
We're gonna have
to take 'em.

00:19.320 --> 00:20.654
FBI. Don't move.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.290
DON:
Look, you see

00:22.323 --> 00:23.491
what she did
to Brenner.

00:23.524 --> 00:24.658
What almost happened to you?

00:24.692 --> 00:25.793
I'm not telling you
where she is.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.328
We live, or we die.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.662
Your choice.
Get in the car

00:28.696 --> 00:29.730
and drive.

00:42.676 --> 00:45.746
*

00:58.692 --> 01:02.096
*

01:18.846 --> 01:22.116
*

01:38.732 --> 01:40.468
"Buck goes free."

01:40.501 --> 01:42.770
Looks like she left out
the "or else."

01:42.803 --> 01:44.705
Yeah?

01:46.474 --> 01:49.377
We're doing a complete
canvas of the area, but

01:49.410 --> 01:52.413
aren't a lot of people out here
past 9:00, 10:00 at night.

01:52.446 --> 01:53.581
What about this diner?

01:53.614 --> 01:54.848
Shift change
was 6:00 a.m.

01:54.882 --> 01:56.717
We're tracking down the
night crew right now.

01:56.750 --> 01:59.720
I mean, she left it
like this for a reason.

01:59.753 --> 02:01.655
She's way off her M.O.

02:01.689 --> 02:02.623
No dead bodies left behind.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.725
COLBY: Yeah, what if
it's not a body, though?

02:04.758 --> 02:05.826
-Maybe it's a hostage.
-DON: Maybe.

02:05.859 --> 02:07.561
-What's the deal with Megan?
Where is she already?

02:07.595 --> 02:08.729
-I tried calling her

02:08.762 --> 02:10.731
at her apartment and her cell
phone. There was no answer.

02:10.764 --> 02:12.933
-Yeah, well, try Larry. -We
don't have a number for him.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.468
And you know
he's not listed, right?

02:14.502 --> 02:15.169
Wait. Fleinhardt?

02:15.203 --> 02:16.337
Charlie!

02:16.370 --> 02:17.705
You kidding me?
Fleinhardt and Megan?

02:17.738 --> 02:19.840
Yeah, man, for about
a few weeks now.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.442
So everybody knows?

02:21.475 --> 02:23.644
Everybody knows now.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.379
I can't believe she
didn't tell me.

02:25.413 --> 02:26.947
Yeah, so it's...
it's like I said earlier.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.783
I mean, even with the new point,
I doubt my pursuit curves

02:29.817 --> 02:31.252
are gonna hold up
any longer.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.221
You know, given the arrest
of Buck Winters,

02:33.254 --> 02:35.223
the change in movement
from random to-to incentivized,

02:35.256 --> 02:36.657
they're no longer a team.

02:36.690 --> 02:39.427
Right. You got a number
on Larry, give it to Colby.

02:39.460 --> 02:40.894
Uh, actually, Larry
doesn't have a number.

02:40.928 --> 02:42.496
-He doesn't have a phone.
-Really?

02:42.530 --> 02:43.731
He doesn't have a cell phone?

02:43.764 --> 02:44.865
Yeah. He calls them
"electronic leashes."

02:44.898 --> 02:46.600
Look, you could try him
at his office,

02:46.634 --> 02:47.701
but, you know,
it's still pretty early.

02:47.735 --> 02:50.204
-(phone ringing) -Oh, wait.
Maybe this is her here.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.740
Yeah, I got her.
Megan, what's the deal?

02:52.773 --> 02:56.644
Is this Agent Eppes,
number one on her speed dial?

02:56.677 --> 02:57.645
Who is this?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.612
Exactly who you think it is.

02:58.646 --> 03:01.982
I want a straight-up trade--
Buck for Reeves.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.684
All right, let me talk to her.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
Burbank Airport, 6:00 p.m.

03:05.386 --> 03:07.855
Have a Cessna fueled
and ready to go.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.293
All right, get an APB
on Megan's car,

03:12.326 --> 03:13.561
and a tap on her cell phone.

03:13.594 --> 03:14.962
Start a GPS tracking.

03:14.995 --> 03:17.298
If you get anything, I want it
triangulated.

03:17.331 --> 03:18.699
MEGAN (recording):
Hey, you've reached 323...

03:18.732 --> 03:20.734
Oh, damn! Pull Winters
out of holding.

03:20.768 --> 03:21.735
What-What's going on?

03:21.769 --> 03:23.871
Hoyle's got Megan.
Let's go!

03:35.816 --> 03:37.951
(sirens wailing)

03:53.033 --> 03:55.569
*

04:02.976 --> 04:04.612
So, Hoyle ditched Megan's
cell phone

04:04.645 --> 04:06.847
in a garbage can off of Alameda.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.882
We got roadblocks set up
all over town.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.883
All right, good.

04:11.885 --> 04:12.986
There she is.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.254
Right.

04:21.995 --> 04:23.964
DON: All right, let's see
how long she waited.

04:23.997 --> 04:25.032
(keyboard clicking)

04:28.569 --> 04:30.838
COLBY:
She didn't wait.

04:30.871 --> 04:31.939
She followed.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.541
DON:
All right, look.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.909
So, Hoyle wakes up,
she finds Buck missing, right?

04:35.943 --> 04:37.478
They've already killed one
old boyfriend, Pierce Brenner.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.612
DON:
And he's out looking for

04:38.646 --> 04:40.881
this guy, Billy Rivers, who-who
is boyfriend number two.

04:40.914 --> 04:42.416
She must have shown up right

04:42.450 --> 04:44.051
at the time we locked up Buck.

04:44.084 --> 04:44.885
And followed us
straight back here.

04:44.918 --> 04:46.720
DON:
That takes some guts, parking

04:46.754 --> 04:47.721
right out
there, man.

04:47.755 --> 04:49.723
What kind of person takes
that kind of risk?

04:49.757 --> 04:51.058
The scariest kind--

04:51.091 --> 04:54.528
too crazy to care,
smart enough not to get caught.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.964
LARRY:
We-We had breakfast.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.366
We said good-bye.

04:58.399 --> 04:59.667
What time was that?

04:59.700 --> 05:02.736
Oh, I don't know. 4:30
or quarter to 5:00.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.037
Did you notice anything else?

05:04.071 --> 05:06.440
A car maybe,
somebody hanging around?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.975
No, no.
I was just...

05:08.008 --> 05:10.077
I was focused
on Megan.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.679
And that is
not true.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.980
That's not true.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.114
I had my
own agenda.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.351
My own need to return to my
own intellectual orbit.

05:17.385 --> 05:19.052
What the hell is
wrong with me?

05:19.086 --> 05:21.121
We're going
to get her back, Larry, okay?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.556
She's one of ours.

05:22.590 --> 05:24.658
If I'd just waited
the 15 minutes,

05:24.692 --> 05:26.927
followed her car
home with my car.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.931
Larry,

05:30.964 --> 05:33.801
Megan is a decorated FBI agent,

05:33.834 --> 05:35.536
she's a black belt
in Krav Maga,

05:35.569 --> 05:37.505
and one of the best shots
in this office.

05:37.538 --> 05:38.672
What-What
are you...?

05:38.706 --> 05:40.508
Is this your artless way

05:40.541 --> 05:42.009
of saying
that I lacked

05:42.042 --> 05:44.378
the competence to defend her?

05:46.113 --> 05:49.116
It's my way of saying
that on a good day,

05:49.149 --> 05:52.920
any one of us can be gotten to.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.876
(door opening)

06:15.909 --> 06:17.845
It's bolted to the wall.

06:19.146 --> 06:21.081
But go ahead
and satisfy yourself.

06:21.114 --> 06:23.751
You've kidnapped
a federal agent.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.019
I'm wanted for murder, assault,

06:26.053 --> 06:27.287
enough robberies
to lose track.

06:27.320 --> 06:30.023
You really want to tell me now
how I'm supposed to let you go

06:30.057 --> 06:31.058
before I get into big trouble?

06:31.091 --> 06:33.026
You're smart enough
to know what you're doing.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.428
What I want to know is why.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.129
(distant sirens)

06:36.163 --> 06:38.131
I told them
I'd trade you for Buck.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.802
That keeps you breathing,
till 6:00 p.m., at least.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.837
'Cause you really think

06:43.871 --> 06:45.439
they're going
to negotiate with you?

06:45.473 --> 06:47.441
-(laughs)
-No, you don't.

06:47.475 --> 06:48.408
You're not stupid,

06:48.442 --> 06:50.611
and I don't believe
you're crazy, either.

06:50.644 --> 06:53.146
Throwing away the life I had,

06:53.180 --> 06:55.082
there are those
who would disagree.

06:55.115 --> 06:56.950
Yeah, 'cause they don't know
what it's like

06:56.984 --> 06:59.019
to live a life
that isn't your own.

06:59.052 --> 06:59.953
(chuckles)

07:01.889 --> 07:03.491
You read a few files,

07:03.524 --> 07:06.059
you figure you understand me?

07:06.093 --> 07:08.028
Yeah, I might know you
a little better

07:08.061 --> 07:09.463
than you think, Crystal.

07:09.497 --> 07:10.764
I left home at 16.

07:10.798 --> 07:14.602
Oh. How long did it take them
to drag you back?

07:14.635 --> 07:17.505
I didn't go back.

07:17.538 --> 07:18.906
But, you know,
things got a little crazy,

07:18.939 --> 07:20.007
and I had a wakeup call,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.610
and I had to decide
which way the rest of my life

07:22.643 --> 07:24.077
was going to go.

07:26.046 --> 07:27.615
(sighs)

07:27.648 --> 07:29.683
Yeah? You ever miss crazy?

07:31.552 --> 07:34.922
16 and waking up
every day free,

07:34.955 --> 07:38.058
having no idea where the day
was going to take me?

07:38.091 --> 07:40.894
Yeah, I miss it.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.633
Is there some reason

07:45.666 --> 07:47.234
-you're telling me all this?
-The more

07:47.267 --> 07:49.703
you know about me, the less
likely you are to kill me.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.505
(laughs)

07:53.774 --> 07:55.876
Sit down.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.911
Crystal took a hostage.

07:57.945 --> 08:00.914
So?

08:00.948 --> 08:03.617
A federal agent she
wants to trade you for.

08:03.651 --> 08:06.954
And you want your agent back?

08:06.987 --> 08:08.221
Then you'd better.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.792
You're not going anywhere until
you tell me what I want to know.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.994
That's fine.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.295
I got all day.

08:15.328 --> 08:18.699
Well, I don't,
and that should worry you.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.033
Yeah? Why?

08:20.067 --> 08:21.268
'Cause nothing
matters to me

08:21.301 --> 08:24.071
except getting my agent back,
and I got very little time,

08:24.104 --> 08:25.539
and you're my only lead.

08:25.573 --> 08:27.708
So what?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.943
What are you
going to do?

08:29.977 --> 08:31.912
Are you going to beat me up?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.113
I've never beaten
a prisoner

08:33.146 --> 08:35.749
in my life, but if you don't
tell me what I want to know

08:35.783 --> 08:37.217
by the time I walk out
of that door,

08:37.250 --> 08:40.020
it's out of my hands.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.824
I'm not telling you

08:43.857 --> 08:45.926
anything.

08:50.230 --> 08:55.135
-You sure this is what you want
to do? -Do I look unsure?

08:55.168 --> 08:57.237
COLBY: Don, I'm just saying,
I've seen what happens

08:57.270 --> 08:59.039
when you cross certain lines.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.575
It can be really hard
to find your way back.

09:01.609 --> 09:04.177
Colby, the only thing
I want to find is my agent.

09:10.283 --> 09:12.986
Charles.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.154
Why are you just

09:14.187 --> 09:16.023
sitting here?

09:16.056 --> 09:17.357
I'm thinking.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.326
About?

09:19.359 --> 09:23.163
Pareto improvements,

09:23.196 --> 09:26.900
shapely values, centipedes.

09:29.136 --> 09:32.139
You know, Charles,
Megan is a captive,

09:32.172 --> 09:34.775
and she may be
gravely wounded.

09:34.808 --> 09:37.878
I think this might be
a time for solutions,

09:37.911 --> 09:41.048
and not these-these
intellectual musings.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.885
Larry, I'm every bit as
concerned about her as you are.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.119
Oh, I doubt that.

09:46.153 --> 09:48.088
But for me to help,

09:48.121 --> 09:50.223
I need to maintain
an even temper

09:50.257 --> 09:52.726
and a lucid thought process,

09:52.760 --> 09:55.763
so, your anxiety
is understandable,

09:55.796 --> 09:58.231
but it's not helpful.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.002
Yeah, I know, I know.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.905
I'm just clouded with emotion,

10:04.938 --> 10:08.909
and I am perversely
resenting you

10:08.942 --> 10:10.911
your clear-headedness here.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.080
What can I do to help?

10:13.113 --> 10:15.048
Right now?

10:16.183 --> 10:17.985
Leave.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.321
Yeah. I will do that.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.434
They were staying in an
abandoned house off of Ventura.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.635
She's probably
not there anymore.

10:35.669 --> 10:38.271
All right, you got five minutes
to put together a team.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.940
He tell you where she'd go next?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.374
If he knew, he would've told me.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.153
-Clear.
-Clear.

11:13.073 --> 11:14.041
Clear.

11:14.074 --> 11:14.942
Megan's car.

11:17.044 --> 11:19.112
All right, pop the trunk.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.217
All right.

11:24.251 --> 11:25.853
She dumped Megan's phone
about a mile

11:25.886 --> 11:26.987
from here,
and then they changed cars.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.990
Took Megan with her--
that means she's still alive.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.058
CHARLIE:
So what we have, really,

11:31.091 --> 11:32.893
is a bargaining game with
incomplete information.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.028
You know, it's as if one
player has offered something

11:35.062 --> 11:37.297
to a second player in
exchange for something

11:37.330 --> 11:39.733
that the second player's
just unable to relinquish.

11:39.767 --> 11:42.035
So the trick, I think,
is to alter the game,

11:42.069 --> 11:44.137
or, you know, alter the
parameters of the game.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.406
You mean like a sudden-death
overtime to break a tie score.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.241
You know what?

11:48.275 --> 11:50.477
That's not a bad example.
That's not bad.

11:50.510 --> 11:53.480
However, imagine two people
playing tic-tac-toe.

11:53.513 --> 11:55.949
If both play rationally,
and neither make a mistake,

11:55.983 --> 11:58.752
well, then the game will always
end in a draw, right?

11:58.786 --> 12:00.888
I mean in order
for one side to win,

12:00.921 --> 12:02.923
you have to alter
the rules of the game,

12:02.956 --> 12:05.192
you know allow "X" to, to make
two consecutive moves

12:05.225 --> 12:08.095
or prohibit "O" from choosing
a crucial square.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.129
-You mean cheat.
-Well, yeah,

12:09.162 --> 12:10.764
I mean you could
put it that way.

12:10.798 --> 12:13.033
See-see our ability
to alter this game

12:13.066 --> 12:15.368
stems from the fact
that Crystal Hoyle,

12:15.402 --> 12:18.338
really, she wants more
than one thing.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.474
When we caught Buck, they
were looking for Billy Rivers.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.477
Rivers has been pretty good
at hiding from her

12:24.511 --> 12:26.113
-and from us, though.
-However,

12:26.146 --> 12:28.048
we can apply some
forward induction

12:28.081 --> 12:29.549
to that problem, as well.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.251
Rivers' criminal history

12:31.284 --> 12:33.020
contains one striking
commonality,

12:33.053 --> 12:34.454
the appearance
of a specific

12:34.487 --> 12:38.325
attorney in 81.25%
of his arrest record.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.927
So you call that attorney.

12:39.960 --> 12:40.894
You explain to him

12:40.928 --> 12:42.896
that his client derives
a greater benefit

12:42.930 --> 12:44.832
from Crystal Hoyle's
apprehension than having to,

12:44.865 --> 12:46.834
to hide for an indeterminate

12:46.867 --> 12:48.068
amount of time.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.569
You think he might
go for that?

12:49.602 --> 12:50.938
Well, hey, you
know, look.

12:50.971 --> 12:54.007
Even a lawyer can't
argue with math.

12:56.043 --> 12:58.879
So you got to explain
something to me.

12:58.912 --> 13:02.315
Isn't that how the bad guys
always get caught in the movies,

13:02.349 --> 13:03.851
explaining too much?

13:03.884 --> 13:06.253
You really consider
yourself to be a bad guy?

13:06.286 --> 13:08.155
Don't you?

13:08.188 --> 13:09.156
I don't generally

13:09.189 --> 13:11.859
believe in bad and good,
I believe in reasons.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.026
I think Buck killed his father

13:13.060 --> 13:14.527
and that was his
reason for running.

13:14.561 --> 13:16.063
But I don't know what yours is.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.099
Well, I couldn't just
abandon him.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.902
Sweet boy.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.971
So intense.

13:24.004 --> 13:26.473
Don't you remember what life was
like when you were that age,

13:26.506 --> 13:30.077
and love was just
so uncomplicated?

13:30.110 --> 13:31.144
Yeah, but

13:31.178 --> 13:32.445
Crystal, he's just a boy.

13:32.479 --> 13:33.881
Oh, really?

13:33.914 --> 13:35.182
'Cause I don't know many

13:35.215 --> 13:36.984
men twice his age
that'd be willing

13:37.017 --> 13:39.019
to take care of a woman
and her...

13:39.052 --> 13:40.320
And her what?

13:40.353 --> 13:41.488
Are you pregnant?

13:41.521 --> 13:43.156
No, I'm not pregnant.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.058
Were you pregnant?

13:45.092 --> 13:47.060
Once upon a time.

13:50.430 --> 13:54.001
When you were 15,
is that why you ran away?

13:54.034 --> 13:56.636
No, I ran away because
I was a B plus student,

13:56.669 --> 13:58.838
soccer team, never kissed a boy.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.608
Parents never let me out of

14:01.641 --> 14:04.144
their sight, they were so afraid
of me screwing up my life.

14:04.177 --> 14:05.345
So that's exactly
what you did.

14:05.378 --> 14:06.947
You came here and
you got involved

14:06.980 --> 14:09.917
with a married man,
and your friend Lydia...

14:09.950 --> 14:12.152
said you ran away
for six months.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.186
Did Brenner get you pregnant?

14:13.220 --> 14:17.357
Yeah, all of a sudden
he couldn't leave his wife.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.494
His father-in-law was going to
help him open up a car lot.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.898
So he made some arrangements.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.134
All Pierce had

14:27.167 --> 14:29.202
to do was drive me
to Billy's house.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.105
It was the last I saw
of that bastard.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.606
Until Tuesday night.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.280
But I'll say one thing
for Billy,

14:40.313 --> 14:44.151
he's a better salesman
than Pierce.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.186
'Cause he convinced me that

14:46.219 --> 14:49.456
my daughter would be better off
with some other family.

14:49.489 --> 14:53.026
Crystal, do you know where
your daughter is?

14:54.127 --> 14:56.096
No.

14:59.299 --> 15:02.035
Billy's going to tell me.

15:02.069 --> 15:05.072
And I'm going to find her
and get her back.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.314
Haven't seen the girl
in like 15 years.

15:14.347 --> 15:15.949
But you knew she was
looking for you.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.551
Uh, that friend of hers,
Lydia was asking around.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.320
I heard Crystal'd
been on the Strip,

15:20.353 --> 15:22.189
hitting some of the old places,

15:22.222 --> 15:23.523
talking to some
of the old people.

15:23.556 --> 15:25.092
Why does she want
to kill you, Billy?

15:26.193 --> 15:28.095
Who says she does?

15:28.128 --> 15:31.264
She shows up, you drop
everything, disappear,

15:31.298 --> 15:33.133
you tuck tail and run?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.701
Girlfriend shows up,
way past the expiration date,

15:34.734 --> 15:36.436
you don't go
out of your way

15:36.469 --> 15:40.107
to make yourself available,
you know what I mean?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.242
I thought he was here
to cooperate.

15:42.275 --> 15:44.111
My client is
cooperating.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.645
Came here of his own volition.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.285
Anything?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.686
They're wasting
our time here.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.122
Take a look at this.

15:55.155 --> 15:56.656
May change his attitude.

15:56.689 --> 15:59.092
It's the deep background Megan
requested on Pierce Brenner.

16:01.094 --> 16:05.198
DON: In 1992, Pierce Brenner
made a $50,000 payoff.

16:05.232 --> 16:06.666
-Pierce who?
-Not to you.

16:06.699 --> 16:08.635
To you.

16:08.668 --> 16:11.604
Come on, you're asking me
about a single

16:11.638 --> 16:13.440
-fee from 15 years ago--
-From a dead car dealer

16:13.473 --> 16:15.308
who had the same
girlfriend as your client.

16:15.342 --> 16:16.476
In 1992.

16:16.509 --> 16:17.677
So?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.179
So, that's a small world,
Counselor.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.413
Wait a minute, Brenner's dead?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.349
Hoyle killed him two nights
ago, and if you don't help me

16:22.382 --> 16:24.184
here you're gonna be
bait for me out there.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.218
Are you threatening my client?

16:25.252 --> 16:26.486
Yeah, you bet your ass I am.

16:26.519 --> 16:27.620
We came in here

16:27.654 --> 16:28.655
-voluntarily.
-Hey.

16:28.688 --> 16:30.223
I have an agent four, five hours

16:30.257 --> 16:31.624
-away from being killed.
-We're done here.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.393
Oh, you may be but he's not.
Arrest him.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.229
-Arrest me? For what? -For
statutory rape, how's that huh?

16:36.263 --> 16:38.465
Corrupting a minor, how about
that? Crystal Hoyle was 15.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.633
You've just made a big mistake,
Agent Eppes.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.302
Yeah, sue me.

16:53.613 --> 16:57.284
I'm crossing lines here.

16:57.317 --> 17:00.087
I'm doing things I
wouldn't have done before.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.390
You know, I mean
I'm desperate.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.758
I-I don't know what else
to do, I got no answers.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.627
You're not responsible.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.329
No, that's exactly what I am.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.364
And I should have turned
Edgerton loose

17:11.398 --> 17:14.334
on that kid before;
I'd have Hoyle by now.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.769
There's something called the law
of unintended consequences.

17:16.803 --> 17:17.770
Charlie, I don't care

17:17.804 --> 17:18.905
about your laws, all right?

17:18.938 --> 17:20.607
I don't care about your
theories, or your algorithms.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.609
You know,
I mean

17:22.642 --> 17:24.211
this is like spitting
in the ocean here.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.416
The ocean?

17:30.817 --> 17:32.385
We're reasonably certain

17:32.419 --> 17:35.622
that Megan and Crystal
are somewhere in here.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.290
Well, there's no such thing
as a perfect dragnet.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.158
The roadblock went up

17:38.191 --> 17:40.193
around the time that
she switched cars.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.228
Right around here.

17:43.330 --> 17:46.399
Well, there's something
called the trawler problem,

17:46.433 --> 17:49.336
where a fast boat chases
a slower boat

17:49.369 --> 17:52.205
until the slower boat
disappears into a fog bank.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.606
Let me guess,
we're the faster boat.

17:53.640 --> 17:55.142
Right, and-and this

17:55.175 --> 17:57.410
is the fog bank.

17:57.444 --> 17:58.845
The boundaries of the dragnet.

17:58.878 --> 18:02.215
The solution to the problem is
for the faster boat to assume

18:02.249 --> 18:04.184
that the slower boat
has turned around

18:04.217 --> 18:05.418
and is heading back toward it.

18:05.452 --> 18:07.787
EDGERTON: -Why the hell would
she do that? -She wouldn't.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.290
The beauty of the solution
is it doesn't matter.

18:10.323 --> 18:12.725
Using the last
known location

18:12.759 --> 18:15.128
of the missing boat
as an origin point,

18:15.162 --> 18:16.163
we spiral out,

18:16.196 --> 18:19.566
and intersect
with the slower boat

18:19.599 --> 18:22.269
before completing a full turn.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.771
Crystal took Megan from here.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.639
At approximately 4:45 a.m.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.408
She then contacted you,

18:28.441 --> 18:31.144
and discarded
Megan's phone here,

18:31.178 --> 18:34.147
at 6:50 a.m.

18:34.181 --> 18:36.149
Shortly afterward,
she and Megan

18:36.183 --> 18:37.250
headed back...

18:37.284 --> 18:39.586
here.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.321
Charlie, this isn't
the open ocean, though.

18:41.354 --> 18:42.522
This is a city.

18:42.555 --> 18:45.192
Right, right. No, we have to
consider variegated terrain.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.193
And a considerable

18:46.226 --> 18:47.227
time gap.

18:47.260 --> 18:48.261
Compensate for

18:48.295 --> 18:50.297
the time lag, add overlapping

18:50.330 --> 18:53.600
search spirals to maximize
the area covered.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.335
Anyone else following this?

18:55.368 --> 18:57.804
Just nod your head and
wait for the punch line.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.839
Punch line... is

18:59.872 --> 19:01.841
something like...

19:04.877 --> 19:06.579
...this.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.623
All right, we're
turning out to

19:16.656 --> 19:18.325
Whitmore.

19:20.627 --> 19:23.230
We could cross their paths
and not even know it.

19:23.263 --> 19:25.298
Beats the hell out of sitting
around the office

19:25.332 --> 19:27.200
waiting for Hoyle
to make the next move.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.406
Make this left on Beaudry.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.375
Left on Beaudry.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.750
Shouldn't we be headed
to the airport?

19:43.783 --> 19:46.919
You think I'm a fool, don't you?

19:46.953 --> 19:49.656
You don't just abandon
somebody that loves you.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.658
That's the second time
you used the word "abandon."

19:51.691 --> 19:54.761
You talking about Buck
or your daughter?

19:54.794 --> 19:57.597
Billy just took her
right out of my arms.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.232
Okay, listen to me.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.434
You were 15 years old.

20:01.468 --> 20:03.603
That's an explanation,
it's not an excuse.

20:03.636 --> 20:06.239
I was too weak
to protect her then.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.740
I'm not weak anymore.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.742
Crystal, she's not a baby.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.344
You're talking about
a teenage girl

20:11.378 --> 20:12.645
who you wouldn't recognize

20:12.679 --> 20:13.913
-if she walked in that door.
-No.

20:13.946 --> 20:17.484
-There's a bond between a mother
and a child... -You know what,

20:17.517 --> 20:18.751
that is a fantasy.

20:18.785 --> 20:19.986
You know what reality is?

20:20.019 --> 20:21.588
You are thinking of ripping

20:21.621 --> 20:23.490
her out of the
arms of two people

20:23.523 --> 20:26.326
who've devoted their entire
lives to taking care of her.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.395
And what kind of a life
do you have to offer?

20:28.428 --> 20:29.629
You going to take her on

20:29.662 --> 20:31.664
the road with you
robbing liquor stores?

20:31.698 --> 20:32.632
-Shut up!
-She is old

20:32.665 --> 20:33.866
enough to be Buck's sister.

20:33.900 --> 20:34.867
She's the same age
you were when you

20:34.901 --> 20:37.504
left home, is that why
you're going to do this?

20:37.537 --> 20:39.806
You're going to make your child
live through all the same

20:39.839 --> 20:41.708
mistakes you made?

20:41.741 --> 20:42.809
I thought

20:42.842 --> 20:44.377
you were trying to stay alive.

20:44.411 --> 20:46.245
I just... I want you
to think this through.

21:01.027 --> 21:05.365
DISPATCHER: Report of gunshots,
Twilight Motel, Third and Bixel.

21:05.398 --> 21:06.533
That's two blocks
from here.

21:06.566 --> 21:07.600
Yeah, that's
the next stop

21:07.634 --> 21:08.935
on Charlie's map.

21:08.968 --> 21:12.739
(siren wails)

21:17.076 --> 21:19.612
Hey.
Room 15.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.013
(gunshot)

21:21.047 --> 21:22.715
Move.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.053
Shots fired,
Twilight Motel.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.559
Shoot me and we all go.

21:32.592 --> 21:33.726
Okay.

21:33.760 --> 21:34.727
Slow down, Crystal.

21:34.761 --> 21:35.628
Just calm down.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.363
Grenade.

21:44.871 --> 21:45.905
(groans)

21:54.514 --> 21:56.983
(siren wailing)

21:57.016 --> 21:57.917
They're up there!

21:57.950 --> 21:59.018
Second floor!

22:01.821 --> 22:02.755
Room 15!

22:15.735 --> 22:18.438
Oh, hey, she's cut, guys!

22:18.471 --> 22:19.872
Hey, Megan, Megan?

22:19.906 --> 22:20.707
Can you hear me?

22:20.740 --> 22:22.575
She's cut bad;
it looks like an artery.

22:22.609 --> 22:24.010
Megan?
She's in and out of it.

22:24.043 --> 22:25.545
Megan, can you hear me?

22:25.578 --> 22:27.880
Hold on, let me see
if his car is here.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.150
Silver Pontiac.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.719
-I need to take the vehicle.
-No, no, no, n-no.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.986
We've got to get her
to a hospital,

22:34.020 --> 22:36.789
she's bleeding out here.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.525
DAVID:
Stay with us, okay?

22:38.558 --> 22:40.092
COLBY: I'll get the door
to the car.

22:40.126 --> 22:41.728
EDGERTON:
LAPD'll be here in two minutes.

22:41.761 --> 22:42.862
She's getting away.

22:42.895 --> 22:43.930
She doesn't have two minutes!

22:43.963 --> 22:45.131
Let's go, let's go.

22:45.164 --> 22:47.133
We got you, sweetie.

22:47.166 --> 22:48.167
Aah!

22:48.200 --> 22:50.136
Stay with us, Megan.

22:56.776 --> 22:58.478
MEGAN: Pierce Brenner
got Crystal Hoyle pregnant,

22:58.511 --> 23:00.880
and then found a lawyer sleazy
enough to do the dirty work.

23:00.913 --> 23:01.814
Right, yeah, yeah.

23:01.848 --> 23:02.815
We're on it--
Adam Benton.

23:02.849 --> 23:04.050
Yeah, he paid
him 50 Gs.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.118
And he was too smart
to leave a straight trail

23:06.152 --> 23:07.587
to a 15-year-old
pregnant girl,

23:07.620 --> 23:09.121
so he farmed out some
of his dirty work

23:09.155 --> 23:10.457
to one of his regular clients.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.891
Billy Rivers.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.793
Who knows
where that kid ended up?

23:13.826 --> 23:15.462
Turns out this whole
thing wasn't just

23:15.495 --> 23:17.530
about payback after all.

23:17.564 --> 23:20.700
No, I think killing Brenner was
Crystal's way of symbolically

23:20.733 --> 23:22.902
making room for Buck
as the surrogate father,

23:22.935 --> 23:26.072
and once
that affair was uncovered,

23:26.105 --> 23:28.074
which was totally rooted
in all the childhood traumas,

23:28.107 --> 23:30.009
it was
like the floodgates opened

23:30.042 --> 23:33.112
and now she's
chasing a 16-year-old fantasy

23:33.145 --> 23:35.715
of love and family.

23:35.748 --> 23:36.849
Well, Rivers is
thoroughly lawyered up

23:36.883 --> 23:38.918
and we're going
to have a hell of a time

23:38.951 --> 23:41.688
trying to dig up
a 15-year-old black market baby.

23:41.721 --> 23:43.856
We sure don't have enough
to take on his attorney Benton.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.625
Judge'll never give us a warrant
on this little.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.159
Right, well, we keep digging.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.227
MEGAN:
Hey, guys,

23:48.260 --> 23:50.830
before this gets away from us,
I just wanted to say,

23:50.863 --> 23:53.500
thanks very much
for the really good timing.

23:53.533 --> 23:54.701
DON:
Wasn't me.

23:54.734 --> 23:55.802
It was all you, Kickass,

23:55.835 --> 23:57.804
with that gunshot, come on.

23:57.837 --> 24:01.474
It just felt like a really good
time for a Hail Mary there,

24:01.508 --> 24:03.242
but I was so lucky
that you two were

24:03.275 --> 24:04.811
-in the area.
-COLBY: No.

24:04.844 --> 24:06.746
That wasn't all luck.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.748
Ooh, my friend Charlie.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.016
Yeah, he invented

24:10.049 --> 24:11.818
a whole new search pattern.

24:11.851 --> 24:14.020
I think he's calling it the
"Reeves Variation."

24:14.053 --> 24:15.121
(Megan laughing)

24:15.154 --> 24:16.889
Oh, man,
you get kidnapped for the day,

24:16.923 --> 24:18.024
you miss a lot around here.

24:18.057 --> 24:20.059
DAVID: I still don't understand
why Crystal grabbed you.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.260
I mean, she's smart enough

24:21.293 --> 24:22.929
to know we weren't going
to release Buck.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.132
I think she feels like
she failed to protect one child

24:26.165 --> 24:27.767
and she didn't want to see

24:27.800 --> 24:29.201
the same thing happen
to another.

24:29.235 --> 24:31.037
I don't know,

24:31.070 --> 24:33.740
maybe she just subconsciously
wanted her story told.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.742
But you know,

24:35.775 --> 24:37.677
the whole time we were in there,
she was outside the motel

24:37.710 --> 24:38.945
-on a pay phone.
-DON: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

24:38.978 --> 24:40.046
we're on the phone dump.

24:40.079 --> 24:41.147
Don't you worry, all right,
you just get your rest.

24:41.180 --> 24:43.616
We're supposed to let you
get rest, so let's go, guys.

24:43.650 --> 24:44.784
Good job.

24:44.817 --> 24:46.786
We're here,
all right?

24:46.819 --> 24:48.788
Charlie never gave me
a variation.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.523
(laughs)

24:50.557 --> 24:52.058
Hey, is she okay?

24:52.091 --> 24:53.092
Yeah, yeah, she's fine,

24:53.125 --> 24:55.261
but you guys got to keep it
short, all right?

24:55.294 --> 24:58.064
David, uh, earlier today,

24:58.097 --> 25:03.269
in the throes of, you know,
unprecedented anxiety and fear,

25:03.302 --> 25:06.072
I-I said some things
and I used a word...

25:06.105 --> 25:07.607
-Artless.
-That's the word.

25:07.640 --> 25:10.109
I just want you to
know, I-I apologize for,

25:10.142 --> 25:13.980
and thoroughly renounce, the
harshness of my language.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.582
You know I have to admit,

25:15.615 --> 25:16.749
I thought I'd been called

25:16.783 --> 25:17.884
every name there was,

25:17.917 --> 25:19.652
but that was a new one, Larry.

25:31.263 --> 25:32.599
Hey.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.734
Oh, I'm sorry.
Only have a few hours--

25:34.767 --> 25:37.737
I didn't want to waste it
going back to my apartment.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.905
How's Megan?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.339
Oh, she's going
to be okay.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.274
You can go visit her
in the morning if you want.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.043
Yeah.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.178
I can't stop thinking about

25:46.212 --> 25:48.347
how far I would have gone
to get her back.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.882
How far did you go?

25:51.618 --> 25:53.019
Oh.

26:01.127 --> 26:02.929
Hey, uh, remember

26:02.962 --> 26:06.733
when you were in Little League
and you got beaned?

26:06.766 --> 26:09.068
What, you mean when
John Kinsella thought

26:09.101 --> 26:10.169
I was crowding the plate?

26:10.202 --> 26:12.071
Well, you were crowding
the plate.

26:12.104 --> 26:16.242
I blame myself for not telling
you to back off, but um...

26:16.275 --> 26:17.977
I took it out on your coach.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.179
I told him to meet me
in the parking lot.

26:20.212 --> 26:21.848
What?

26:21.881 --> 26:25.151
My point is that when
you care about people,

26:25.184 --> 26:29.288
and feel responsible for them,
it can blind your good sense.

26:29.321 --> 26:33.025
Yeah, well, that's the
question-- when's it come back?

26:33.059 --> 26:34.193
Or does it?

26:34.226 --> 26:35.895
Well, in my case,

26:35.928 --> 26:37.897
it was right at the moment
that I realized

26:37.930 --> 26:41.768
that Coach McGuinness
was a Golden Gloves boxer.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.969
(chuckles)

26:43.002 --> 26:46.305
You see, when you
wrestle with your choices,

26:46.338 --> 26:48.908
you can take that as a sign
that good sense will return.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.611
Sooner or later.

26:56.883 --> 26:59.051
Yeah, so what's up
with the condo?

26:59.085 --> 27:02.822
Oh, I narrowed it down to two.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.758
You know, Dad...

27:05.792 --> 27:09.028
I kind of hate my apartment.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.163
Relax, they both
have tennis courts.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.232
Well, what I mean is...

27:13.265 --> 27:14.867
I mean, I don't know

27:14.901 --> 27:17.169
if you notice,
but I'm over here a lot.

27:17.203 --> 27:19.005
No, really?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.973
Yeah. And I got that
second room.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.009
I keep thinking I should
do something with it.

27:23.042 --> 27:26.713
It's full of boxes that have
been there, what, two years?

27:26.746 --> 27:29.782
Are you suggesting
that I not move out?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.719
No, what I'm saying is,

27:32.752 --> 27:35.321
just don't underestimate
how great it is

27:35.354 --> 27:37.356
to have somebody to come home
to talk to.

27:39.425 --> 27:40.960
Oh.

27:46.365 --> 27:48.467
-Hey.
-Hey.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.969
What are you doing
here so late?

27:50.002 --> 27:52.338
I could ask you
the same thing.

27:52.371 --> 27:54.073
Hey...

27:54.106 --> 27:55.474
do you want to grab

27:55.507 --> 27:57.043
that dinner that we missed?

27:57.076 --> 28:01.480
Um, actually, I kind of knew
I'd be here late, so...

28:01.513 --> 28:03.115
I got a sandwich

28:03.149 --> 28:04.917
on the way in.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.152
Um, I'm sorry.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.121
I should have waited
for you, huh?

28:09.155 --> 28:09.956
I should have...
(clears throat)

28:09.989 --> 28:11.357
I should have called
you at least.

28:11.390 --> 28:13.392
No, it's fine.
I'm not that hungry anyway.

28:13.425 --> 28:15.862
Um, Larry called me,

28:15.895 --> 28:17.930
and I'm glad to hear
that Megan's okay.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.966
I'm sorry. I really...
I should have...

28:19.999 --> 28:21.167
I should have called you.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.869
I shouldn't have
not called you.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.170
-I just got so preoccupied
-Charlie...

28:24.203 --> 28:25.337
with the trawler
problem, and...

28:25.371 --> 28:27.907
-Charlie.
-What?

28:27.940 --> 28:28.975
Have you noticed

28:29.008 --> 28:30.943
that you've been apologizing
to me a lot lately?

28:30.977 --> 28:33.880
Whether you need
to or not?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.416
I'm so... I'm sorry.

28:37.449 --> 28:39.385
No, I... It's just
I guess... yeah...

28:39.418 --> 28:42.755
I have been feeling
a little pressure

28:42.789 --> 28:44.957
since you decided to stay.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.826
I don't want to disappoint you.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.360
Or upset you.

28:48.394 --> 28:51.530
But your solution is to walk
on eggshells around me?

28:51.563 --> 28:55.301
Well, when you put it that way,
it sounds a little untenable.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.536
Setting aside for one moment

28:57.569 --> 28:59.939
the massively egotistical
presumption

28:59.972 --> 29:02.008
that I opted for the
professorship at Calsci

29:02.041 --> 29:03.175
just to date you...

29:03.209 --> 29:04.844
-No, that's...
-Look, Charlie,

29:04.877 --> 29:07.413
I accepted an amazing position.

29:08.981 --> 29:10.950
And yes, I do want to try.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.086
But only if you want
to try, too.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.895
DON:
You think Hoyle's taking off?

29:22.929 --> 29:24.163
She gave up a lot

29:24.196 --> 29:27.533
to get here to find a long-lost
daughter. My instinct says no.

29:27.566 --> 29:29.235
Well, you know,
you should talk to Megan--

29:29.268 --> 29:31.303
see what kind of insights
she got on Hoyle.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.039
I have all the
insight I need.

29:33.072 --> 29:34.874
What, you don't ever get
tunnel vision

29:34.907 --> 29:36.175
being on a manhunt
this long?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.376
I did.

29:37.409 --> 29:38.410
Messed me up,
changed me.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.879
I had to give up
that game.

29:39.912 --> 29:41.380
That's the difference.

29:41.413 --> 29:43.482
Hunting didn't change
me, it chose me.

29:43.515 --> 29:45.852
Guys, I got the phone dump
back from the motel.

29:45.885 --> 29:48.020
Two calls
to the Washington DC office

29:48.054 --> 29:49.956
of the National Criminal
Information Center.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.590
-NCIC?
-Yeah.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.060
Wait, Hoyle had Megan's purse.
That's her contacts, her ID,

29:54.093 --> 29:55.895
-badge.
-Accessing a federal database

29:55.928 --> 29:58.030
is a much better reason
to grab a fed

29:58.064 --> 29:59.098
than some crackpot hostage
switch.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.432
These calls went out

30:00.466 --> 30:03.202
before 9:00 a.m., before
the APB traveled that far.

30:03.235 --> 30:05.204
She was looking for information
on Billy Rivers

30:05.237 --> 30:07.306
and his attorney of record.

30:07.339 --> 30:08.307
Adam Benton.

30:08.340 --> 30:09.575
-All right, you on that?
-Yeah.

30:09.608 --> 30:11.410
All right call me if
you get anything.

30:11.443 --> 30:12.211
All right.

30:12.244 --> 30:15.081
Time of death was
around 2:00 a.m.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.016
Pistol-whipped
and then shot.

30:17.049 --> 30:18.317
Looks like Crystal
connected the dots.

30:18.350 --> 30:19.986
She had the same
idea Charlie did.

30:20.019 --> 30:23.990
If you can't find Rivers,
talk to his lawyer.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.591
These files
on the floor--

30:25.624 --> 30:27.359
payments to hospitals,
nursemaids,

30:27.393 --> 30:28.627
birth certificate
registrations.

30:28.660 --> 30:32.298
Black market babies.

30:32.331 --> 30:35.601
Scumbag like Rivers just can't
sell the kid out on the street.

30:35.634 --> 30:38.537
He has to find himself
a respectable middle man.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.973
Yeah, I'm figuring
all Crystal Hoyle

30:41.007 --> 30:41.908
really wanted from
Billy Rivers

30:41.941 --> 30:44.310
was the name of the guy
who sold her baby.

30:44.343 --> 30:46.178
And the names of the people
who bought it.

30:46.212 --> 30:48.114
It doesn't look like she left
here without her answers.

30:48.147 --> 30:51.017
Which means she knows
where her daughter is.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.019
And we don't.

30:59.258 --> 31:00.659
Aren't you defying the spirit

31:00.692 --> 31:03.395
of the hospital's
discharge rules,

31:03.429 --> 31:04.596
if not the letter?

31:04.630 --> 31:06.165
I have to find her, Larry.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.366
Crystal Hoyle?

31:07.399 --> 31:09.001
Her daughter.

31:09.035 --> 31:09.801
I mean, what's
the difference

31:09.835 --> 31:11.337
if we catch every
bad guy on Earth

31:11.370 --> 31:13.672
if I can't save one innocent
life from being ruined?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.241
Okay, granted,
but where exactly

31:15.274 --> 31:16.675
are we heading to?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.444
I don't know.

31:18.477 --> 31:20.947
Benton is dead,
all his files are gone.

31:20.980 --> 31:24.250
Crystal Hoyle may be the only
person on the planet

31:24.283 --> 31:26.452
who knows where her
daughter actually is.

31:26.485 --> 31:28.120
Right this way.

31:28.154 --> 31:31.557
You know, in physics we approach
similar conundrums

31:31.590 --> 31:33.425
as inverse problems.

31:33.459 --> 31:35.394
You mean, you start
with the answers

31:35.427 --> 31:37.429
-and you work your way back to
the question? -That's correct.

31:37.463 --> 31:39.465
Instead of exploring
the psyche of the hunter,

31:39.498 --> 31:42.234
we look at the thought
processes of the hunted.

31:42.268 --> 31:43.535
Okay, so we have

31:43.569 --> 31:46.372
a childless couple
desperate to start a family.

31:46.405 --> 31:47.606
So desperate

31:47.639 --> 31:49.341
that they might turn
a blind eye

31:49.375 --> 31:51.377
to the morally opprobrious means

31:51.410 --> 31:53.412
by which the child comes
into their lives.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.513
Yes, you're right.

31:54.546 --> 31:57.283
They would try and erase
all the emotional evidence.

31:57.316 --> 32:00.452
They would take possession
by any acts of normalcy.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.421
But what, what acts?

32:02.454 --> 32:05.091
A birth certificate,
a pediatrician,

32:05.124 --> 32:06.458
a social security number.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.595
The first three digits
of a social

32:09.628 --> 32:12.231
are assigned by the zip code
of the applicant.

32:12.264 --> 32:16.135
CHARLIE: And the next two break
down numbers from the same area

32:16.168 --> 32:19.638
into smaller, easier to manage
blocks.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.240
Even if we focus on numbers

32:21.273 --> 32:22.441
generated in Southern
California,

32:22.474 --> 32:24.510
that still leaves us
with a lot of data.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.446
But in California,
each hospital

32:27.479 --> 32:30.416
is assigned a batch
of social security numbers

32:30.449 --> 32:32.418
based on birthrate
projections.

32:32.451 --> 32:33.519
Which gives us
another filter.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.686
Exactly.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.056
So then, by looking at
the remaining numbers

32:37.089 --> 32:38.257
issued around the time

32:38.290 --> 32:40.359
that Crystal's baby would
have been born...

32:40.392 --> 32:43.362
we can apply a
sorting algorithm.

32:43.395 --> 32:45.031
Like...

32:45.064 --> 32:46.365
(computer beeps)

32:46.398 --> 32:48.334
...this.

32:48.367 --> 32:49.735
That'll pull out
anomalous data in packets,

32:49.768 --> 32:51.103
which we can further
break down.

32:51.137 --> 32:53.072
-Right.
-Good.

33:01.547 --> 33:04.450
You know, I started
playing golf last year

33:04.483 --> 33:05.584
because my dad
plays golf,

33:05.617 --> 33:07.353
you know, Don plays
golf, so I thought

33:07.386 --> 33:09.355
it might be something
we could do together.

33:09.388 --> 33:11.490
Sounds great.

33:11.523 --> 33:13.492
Except that I
was terrible.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.727
You know, my body wouldn't do
what it was supposed to do,

33:15.761 --> 33:17.729
and the math
of the ball

33:17.763 --> 33:21.500
trajectory was always
being challenged by...

33:21.533 --> 33:23.802
reality.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.338
And right away,
I-I-I wanted to quit.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.607
I think I tend

33:28.640 --> 33:30.076
to give up on things

33:30.109 --> 33:32.444
that I don't
learn quickly.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.446
Which is a character flaw

33:34.480 --> 33:36.415
that I am working on.

33:41.520 --> 33:43.355
So, did you get better at golf?

33:43.389 --> 33:45.391
No, I'm still terrible,
but I'm improving.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.659
I'm enjoying
the journey.

33:47.693 --> 33:49.761
You know, if we put

33:49.795 --> 33:51.130
something like this

33:51.163 --> 33:52.564
in the filter,
I think that it would...

33:52.598 --> 33:53.799
Oh, yeah.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.567
Yeah, that
makes it--

33:55.601 --> 33:57.403
that makes it so
much more...

33:57.436 --> 33:59.371
elegant.

34:05.577 --> 34:09.181
*

34:21.527 --> 34:25.697
*

34:40.712 --> 34:44.716
*

34:57.363 --> 34:59.298
(siren blares)

35:06.238 --> 35:08.174
(cell phone rings)

35:10.509 --> 35:12.411
COLBY:
Hello?

35:12.444 --> 35:15.247
Megan, a call for you

35:15.281 --> 35:16.615
came in
from the switchboard.

35:17.616 --> 35:18.550
Reeves.

35:18.584 --> 35:21.220
She's beautiful, isn't she?

35:22.754 --> 35:24.923
Yes, she is.

35:24.956 --> 35:26.658
Crystal, it's
time to come in.

35:26.692 --> 35:29.228
I want to talk to Buck.

35:29.261 --> 35:31.363
You need to trust me now.

35:31.397 --> 35:33.499
I trust you to trace
this phone call.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.566
You have Buck call me

35:34.600 --> 35:37.135
and I might talk long
enough for you to find me.

35:48.414 --> 35:49.948
Crys?

35:49.981 --> 35:52.818
Hey, baby.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.220
How are they treating you?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.321
I screwed up, Crys.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.523
I know you told me to wait,
but I couldn't just...

35:57.556 --> 35:58.924
Shh, don't let it
get to you, Buck.

35:58.957 --> 36:02.494
Screwing up's the part
of life you learn from.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.796
BUCK:
I told them it was all me.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.365
I'm going to plead guilty
to everything.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.967
You can turn yourself in now.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.303
They have to let you go.

36:11.337 --> 36:13.372
You sweet, silly boy.

36:13.405 --> 36:15.374
You know how much I love you?

36:15.407 --> 36:17.243
I love you, too, baby.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.945
They can't keep us apart
from each other forever.

36:23.982 --> 36:26.252
You'll wait for me,

36:26.285 --> 36:27.586
won't you, Crys?

36:31.490 --> 36:34.960
(beeping)

36:34.993 --> 36:36.395
Hey, it's Eppes.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.896
We need a helicopter
and a roadblock.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.565
CRYSTAL:
Only two people in the world

36:39.598 --> 36:42.768
I ever loved, and I'm no good
for either one of them.

36:43.935 --> 36:46.372
What are you talking about?

36:46.405 --> 36:48.307
Crys, you're my whole life.

36:51.410 --> 36:52.744
Good-bye, Buck.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.380
Crys?

36:55.947 --> 36:57.449
Crys?

37:02.488 --> 37:03.655
Signal's moving south.

37:03.689 --> 37:04.856
She's running for Mexico.

37:04.890 --> 37:05.791
She's got nothing left to lose.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.526
Everything in front
of her's fair game.

37:09.361 --> 37:11.029
The Galton Board, huh?

37:11.062 --> 37:14.366
You drop enough balls, you get a
bell curve distribution.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.768
Honestly Larry,
I could do this

37:16.802 --> 37:18.136
all day long.

37:18.169 --> 37:22.408
Watching what happens when you
begin to block the paths.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.343
The distribution changes,

37:24.376 --> 37:26.978
the patterns alters...
and the ball

37:27.012 --> 37:29.047
no longer has a choice

37:29.080 --> 37:30.916
of where to fall.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.801
All right, guys, heads up.

37:52.638 --> 37:53.905
(sirens blare)

38:01.913 --> 38:04.583
(cell phone rings)

38:04.616 --> 38:07.353
MEGAN (on phone):
It doesn't have to end this way.

38:07.386 --> 38:08.920
I can't think of another way.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.090
Could you tell my daughter...

38:12.123 --> 38:13.925
Tell her what?

38:16.628 --> 38:18.364
Nothing.

38:19.465 --> 38:21.600
It's like I never was.

38:21.633 --> 38:22.968
Crystal...

38:23.001 --> 38:26.004
You might want to get out
of the way, Agent Reeves.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.941
She's coming.

38:42.488 --> 38:43.922
(tires screech)

38:50.696 --> 38:52.063
She's gonna try to run us.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.703
(gunshot, glass breaks)

38:57.736 --> 39:00.105
(tires screeching)

39:04.009 --> 39:05.944
(horn blares)

39:35.907 --> 39:37.776
All right, guys.

39:37.809 --> 39:39.945
Let's clear it.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.891
LARRY: You know, I am forever
looking outward

39:52.924 --> 39:54.192
for my miracles.

39:54.225 --> 39:57.996
Um, Comet Wild 2,
you know, with its core

39:58.029 --> 40:00.632
forged in
stellar flame.

40:00.666 --> 40:02.033
The spectral
properties

40:02.067 --> 40:06.705
of supernova
remnant 1713.7-3946...

40:06.738 --> 40:11.543
Just, the sheer magnificence
of the Magellanic Clouds

40:11.577 --> 40:14.045
and, I don't know,
every once in a while

40:14.079 --> 40:17.015
I allow these,
these outer wonders

40:17.048 --> 40:19.618
to kind of blind me to
the, the inner miracles

40:19.651 --> 40:22.588
that are occurring,
transpiring, every day

40:22.621 --> 40:23.789
all around us.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.824
I didn't see any
miracles today, Larry.

40:25.857 --> 40:27.559
No, no, no,
but, you see,

40:27.593 --> 40:30.095
the tendrils that
connect human beings

40:30.128 --> 40:31.497
one to another,

40:31.530 --> 40:35.000
they're just so,
so... unlikely.

40:35.033 --> 40:37.569
so inherently, uh... fragile.

40:37.603 --> 40:39.204
I-I think
that it's

40:39.237 --> 40:43.675
a miracle that
they even exist at all.

40:43.709 --> 40:45.477
What?

40:45.511 --> 40:46.878
I should shut up, shouldn't I?

40:46.912 --> 40:47.979
No.

40:48.013 --> 40:49.948
You should kiss me now.

40:51.049 --> 40:52.484
Okay.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.053
Of course.

41:11.202 --> 41:14.105
ANNOUNCER: You have to earn a
birdie on this par four.

41:15.707 --> 41:17.576
Hey.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.277
Hey.

41:19.310 --> 41:20.245
You get her?

41:23.782 --> 41:24.282
Bad, huh?

41:24.315 --> 41:25.817
Yep.

41:29.621 --> 41:30.722
Oh, golf?

41:30.756 --> 41:34.225
Yeah, I thought I'd

41:34.259 --> 41:36.528
remove the physical
aspect of the game.

41:36.562 --> 41:37.829
Maybe then I can, uh...

41:37.863 --> 41:38.964
Game your way
into a lower handicap?

41:38.997 --> 41:39.831
Yeah.

41:39.865 --> 41:41.600
Thought you were done
with this sport.

41:41.633 --> 41:43.735
Yeah, I thought I was, too,
and then I...

41:43.769 --> 41:45.871
kinda got into trouble
with Amita.

41:45.904 --> 41:47.205
And golf gets you out of it?

41:48.874 --> 41:51.543
Well, you're the man, Charlie.

41:51.577 --> 41:53.579
You know what?
You shouldn't use

41:53.612 --> 41:55.681
your driver, you should
use the 3 wood there.

41:55.714 --> 41:56.882
Because...?

41:56.915 --> 41:59.017
Because of
the green.

41:59.050 --> 41:59.951
Here. I'll
show you.

41:59.985 --> 42:01.853
All right, just show me.
Just show me, then.

42:01.887 --> 42:04.089
-Well, give me the thing.
-Why do you have to try...?

42:04.122 --> 42:05.957
This has the ring of a very
familiar conversation.

42:05.991 --> 42:06.958
What are you guys...?

42:06.992 --> 42:08.994
-Why do you have to...?
-What is your problem?

42:09.027 --> 42:11.296
-That's so rude. -You're making
a very awkward moment for me.

42:11.329 --> 42:12.931
I have to ask my,
uh, my landlord

42:12.964 --> 42:13.932
-for a favor.
-(bickering)

42:13.965 --> 42:15.233
Will you tell
him to stop it?

42:15.266 --> 42:16.768
Will you tell
him to quit it?

42:16.802 --> 42:18.937
What?

42:18.970 --> 42:22.107
I would like to, uh,
build a private staircase

42:22.140 --> 42:23.241
to my, uh, bedroom.

42:23.274 --> 42:24.943
At my own expense, of course.

42:24.976 --> 42:26.912
What? I thought you
were moving out.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.313
Well, I changed my mind.

42:28.346 --> 42:29.280
Hold on, so no tennis?

42:29.314 --> 42:30.982
You'll have to play
on the public courts,

42:31.016 --> 42:31.983
my friend, like everyone else.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.018
I'm sorry.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.152
And this shouldn't

42:34.185 --> 42:35.153
be construed as disappointment.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.354
Hmm?

42:36.387 --> 42:38.824
What happened?

42:38.857 --> 42:40.726
Well, I did a little
math of my own.

42:40.759 --> 42:42.293
And I, uh,
measured

42:42.327 --> 42:44.730
the, um, benefits of privacy

42:44.763 --> 42:46.331
versus the pleasure
of your company.

42:46.364 --> 42:48.166
-Oh.
-What are you doing?

42:48.199 --> 42:49.701
-Well...
-You're playing golf!

42:49.735 --> 42:50.535
-Yeah.
-Oh!

42:50.568 --> 42:52.871
Thinks he's training
for a comeback.

42:52.904 --> 42:54.673
Is that a 3 wood you're using?

42:54.706 --> 42:56.675
-That's Don's 3 wood.
-You can't use a 3 wood.

42:56.708 --> 42:57.876
He's gotta
get it up, that's why.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.377
No, you gotta use
a 2 iron. Here,

42:59.410 --> 43:00.646
let me show you.

43:00.679 --> 43:01.880
Dad, what are you
talking about?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.114
This is so ridiculous,
you know.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.050
-A little expertise wouldn't
hurt anybody. -This is my game.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.985
This is my TV set.
This is my own house.

43:07.018 --> 43:07.686
Well, why
don't you

43:07.719 --> 43:09.020
get us some of
your beers then?

43:09.054 --> 43:10.789
-Get your own beers.
-Quiet. Watch it.

43:10.822 --> 43:11.957
There you go. Nice.

43:11.990 --> 43:14.025
Dad, are we-- we are
his guests, right?

43:14.059 --> 43:16.094
I'm getting
ready to measure

43:16.127 --> 43:18.229
the benefits of
privacy all over again.
