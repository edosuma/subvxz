00:45.040 --> 00:48.320
They call me Ford Fairlane,
rock 'n'roll detective.

00:49.200 --> 00:51.880
I have the power
to get into the hottest clubs,...

00:51.960 --> 00:55.320
..the hottest dressing rooms
and the hottest chicks.

00:55.400 --> 00:59.760
I admit it all sounds pretty nifty in theory.
Then why am I here?

00:59.840 --> 01:04.360
Why do I wish the music industry and the rest
of the globe would just suck my dick, Tracy?

01:04.440 --> 01:07.760
I'll tell you why. It all startedfive nights ago.

01:08.920 --> 01:12.840
I didn't know it yet, but I was about
to get a case of the Black Plague.

01:12.920 --> 01:16.720
Not the disease that killed
a billion peasants in the 1300s.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.800
Something much scarier.

01:18.880 --> 01:20.880
("Rock 'n'Roll Junkie")

01:31.160 --> 01:33.400
Hello, LA!

01:35.440 --> 01:39.480
You see, this band, The Black Plague,
were considered the new kings of metal.

01:39.560 --> 01:42.720
I thought they were just
some lucky assholes from Reseda.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.960
Anyway, tonight, this guy Bobby Black was
going to give the performance of his life.

02:52.880 --> 02:55.520
I love you, Bobby!

03:09.160 --> 03:13.720
I guess the poor superstar son of a bitch
wasn't that lucky after all, hey?

03:16.600 --> 03:18.840
In the meantime, I was miles away,...

03:18.920 --> 03:22.560
..checking out a tip on the case
of the fanatic red-headedfan.

03:22.640 --> 03:26.280
And making my entrance was unbelievable.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.720
- (all gasp)
- Whoa! Was my fly undone?

04:21.480 --> 04:27.120
I'm so terrifical I even had my own
toll-free number. 1-800-UNBELIEVABLE.

04:27.200 --> 04:29.800
Ford. I gotta ask you to put that out, dude.

04:29.880 --> 04:32.160
Nobody smokes any more.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.240
Thanks, man.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.440
- You son of a bitch.
- Another satisfied customer.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.760
Call me.

04:47.640 --> 04:50.200
What goes for my sister goes double for me.

04:50.280 --> 04:56.560
Don'tyou remember? The Jacuzzi, Laurel
Canyon - Guns N' Roses video wrap party?

04:56.640 --> 05:01.200
Oh, yeah. The twins.
Butyou're not... identical, huh?

05:02.840 --> 05:05.000
Hey, look. Write down my number.

05:05.080 --> 05:09.680
- 555-6321. Got it?
- Yeah. Yeah, thanks.

05:10.080 --> 05:13.200
Wait a minute. 555's not a real number.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.280
They only use that in the movies.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.560
No shit, honey.
What do you thinkthis is? Real life?

05:20.400 --> 05:22.680
- Hey, it's Ford Fairlane.
- Easy money.

05:22.760 --> 05:25.360
(both) Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

05:25.440 --> 05:27.600
Couldn't find a handle on a coffee cup.

05:27.680 --> 05:31.560
And what are your names?
Neil and Bob? Or is that, like, whatyou do?

05:31.640 --> 05:34.000
- You guys driving tonight?
- Yeah.

05:34.080 --> 05:37.600
Why don'tyou take Mulholland?
You'll love the curves. Now move.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.960
Thank Godfor Don Cleveland.
He was the best producer in the biz,...

05:41.040 --> 05:44.560
..the only guy in the industry
I could talk to withoutvomiting Day-Glo.

05:44.640 --> 05:48.640
Ah. I hate that "Mr Rock 'n' Roll
Detective" bullshit, you know?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.960
I'm a professional crime-fighter.

05:51.040 --> 05:55.000
- I work for a living, you knowthat.
- (Don) What are you looking at?

05:55.200 --> 05:58.520
Some redhead's bothering
that girl group, The Pussycats.

05:58.600 --> 06:03.200
Been showing up at their concerts, saying he
wants to rape and kill 'em. Not in that order.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.400
Hey, you're that guy. The private eye.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.760
You're a poet and didn't know it. Oh!

06:09.840 --> 06:13.440
- You heard that Bobby Black OD'd, right?
- Yeah. So?

06:13.520 --> 06:16.200
So, do you suspect foul play and stuff?

06:16.280 --> 06:20.560
I'll letyou know when somebody
pays me to give a shit and stuff.

06:20.640 --> 06:22.920
My name is Melodi.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.000
As in "A pretty girl is like a..."
Here's my phone number.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.200
Whatever you're doing tomorrow...

06:31.800 --> 06:34.360
Cancel. OK?

06:38.160 --> 06:42.280
You got to shave before you
leave the house in a dress like that.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.520
And I don't mean your legs.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.040
Boy, whatyou gonna do?

06:50.120 --> 06:53.080
Hey. You'd better have
that sambuca milkshake ready.

06:53.160 --> 06:55.760
Here comes Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

06:55.840 --> 06:58.080
- Hey, Ford.
- What's goin' on?

06:58.160 --> 07:00.160
Harry. Shake me.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.640
I hope you like it, Ford.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.160
Precocious. Combustionable.

07:13.240 --> 07:18.120
Harry... not thick enough.
Butyou're getting better.

07:19.920 --> 07:22.760
- So how's Mutt and Mutt, huh?
- Hoo! Hoo!

07:22.840 --> 07:25.320
- Who's your friend?
- Sh.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.080
I'm just some guy named Sam, asswipe.

07:28.160 --> 07:31.120
Sam. How cute.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.880
Reminds me of that story,
Green Eggs and Ham.

07:33.960 --> 07:37.840
"Will you eat them in a box?
Will you eat them with a fox?"

07:37.920 --> 07:41.720
Know The Pussycats? Big Doctor Seuss fans.

07:41.800 --> 07:45.400
- (nervous laugh)
- Especially the singer. What's her name?

07:45.480 --> 07:49.040
- I'm drawin' a fuckin' blank.
- (stammers) Josie.

07:52.760 --> 07:56.000
Boy. Wonder if this could be our guy.

07:56.080 --> 07:58.240
Deceitful bitches.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.320
Last dance,...

08:01.400 --> 08:04.480
..Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

08:07.160 --> 08:11.880
You're ten seconds away from
the most embarrassing moment of your life.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.800
Something from our wine list?

08:22.160 --> 08:25.320
Come on, Ford. This shit's gettin' old, man.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.560
- (screams)
- Excuse me a moment.

08:39.039 --> 08:41.480
So many assholes.

08:42.880 --> 08:45.080
So few bullets.

09:04.240 --> 09:06.400
Clint Eastwood?

09:06.480 --> 09:08.880
I fucked him. Oh!

09:11.400 --> 09:13.400
(gentle snoring)

09:13.480 --> 09:14.480
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

09:14.560 --> 09:17.320
Purple Haze all in my brain

09:18.800 --> 09:21.640
Lately things just don't seem the same

09:23.080 --> 09:25.960
Actin'funny, but I don't know why

09:26.720 --> 09:28.720
Do my dishes!

09:34.320 --> 09:36.320
As if my alarm clock wasn't enough,...

09:36.400 --> 09:39.840
..it was time for my late afternoon
wake-up callfrom Jazz.

09:39.920 --> 09:41.960
- Jazz was my assistant.
- (music stops)

09:42.440 --> 09:44.960
Oh, thank God.

09:46.280 --> 09:48.480
- Hello?
- Ford. Do you know what time it is?

09:48.560 --> 09:50.680
And the only woman I treat with sensitivity.

09:50.760 --> 09:54.360
Wonk, wonk. You sound like
Charlie Brown's friggin' teacher.

09:54.440 --> 09:58.840
Why am I late? I was up all night
eatin' Swedish meatballs. Oh!

10:00.120 --> 10:02.320
- I was doin' my job.
- That's a first.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.640
- All right. I'll be in later.
- OK. Don't hang up, because...

10:05.720 --> 10:09.120
- Where are my shoes?
- Hey, girls, what do you need over there?

10:09.200 --> 10:12.240
- Come on.
- Ford, we just needed to be held.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.720
You got the bonus plan.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.880
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

10:24.720 --> 10:27.080
Hey. Wait. Stop.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.160
I'm coming. Hey.

10:32.200 --> 10:35.000
Ow! What's goin' on, kid?

10:35.160 --> 10:40.280
Hey, Fairlane. You gonna find out who
killed the lead singer of The Black Plague?

10:40.360 --> 10:47.160
Tell me, Dr Watson. What makes you so sure
he's just not another piece-of-shit overdose?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.320
- Gut feeling.
- Gut feeling, huh?

10:59.600 --> 11:03.000
See those chicks?
Girl Scouts. Tooktwo boxes.

11:04.320 --> 11:08.280
Hey. Get that outta your mouth!
Don'tyou knowthose things are killers?

11:08.360 --> 11:13.120
Don'tyou go to school, or listen to Smokey
the Bear and all that kind of shit, huh?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.200
(gasping)

11:19.080 --> 11:21.080
You sick son of a bitch.

11:22.560 --> 11:25.120
Have a Twinkie, snapper-head.

11:27.480 --> 11:30.120
I can't breathe in here, Fairlane.

11:30.200 --> 11:34.320
When are you gonna let me work with you?
Why are you always fuckin' with me?

11:34.600 --> 11:38.440
Excuse me! You say the f-word again,
I'll bang you right the fuck out.

11:38.520 --> 11:41.360
Do you understand me?
Now get the fuck outta here.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.840
(muffled banging)

11:42.920 --> 11:45.840
I've got something serious to discuss.

11:45.920 --> 11:49.240
Yeah, what is it? Premature ejaculation? Ha!

11:49.960 --> 11:53.240
You know, Ford,
sometimes you can be a real dick.

11:54.760 --> 11:57.080
"Dick", "fuck"... What kinda kid are you?

12:00.640 --> 12:02.640
(muffled) Fairlane...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.720
My office was at the Crossroads of the World.

12:11.800 --> 12:15.120
The rent was high,
but it was worth it for those chicks.

12:15.200 --> 12:17.200
Those big, fat chicks.

12:18.520 --> 12:20.680
They say all the time,
you know I love your stuff

12:20.760 --> 12:23.840
But no matter what,
they just can't get enough

12:27.960 --> 12:32.320
- Hey, my man Slam.
- Yo. What's happenin'? Cool coat.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.560
Why don'tyou take it across the street to the
7-Eleven? I'm poppin' a fuckin' brain vessel.

12:36.640 --> 12:40.680
If your big gulp-head producer clients
would dare to show a little brains,...

12:40.760 --> 12:44.680
..they would sign my ass up on
that tour and I'd be touring the world.

12:44.760 --> 12:48.400
1990 would be a most glorious year,
you know what I'm sayin'?

12:48.680 --> 12:54.160
Hey, look. I'm only bullshittin'. You know
I dig the new stuff. It's fuckin' phenomenal.

12:57.760 --> 13:01.360
Some people are claustrophobic,
Fairlane. I'm allergic too.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.080
So don't make it out like
I'm some kind of weirdo.

13:04.160 --> 13:06.840
- You can't prove shit.
- Shut up.

13:06.920 --> 13:09.960
Good morning.
She said, as the clock struck five.

13:10.840 --> 13:14.800
Josie was hungry, so I sent The Pussycats
for food. They've been waiting.

13:14.880 --> 13:18.680
They're only a double-platinum band.
They have nothing better to do, right?

13:18.760 --> 13:21.360
Silence, Jazz. That tip paid off.

13:22.040 --> 13:25.480
This is Sam the Sleazebag.
Sam the Sleazebag, Jazz.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.680
- My assistant.
- Hey, Ford. A little late, huh?

13:34.800 --> 13:37.280
I love you all.

13:37.360 --> 13:41.400
That's him. That's the bastard
who flashed us at the Amphitheatre.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.680
- You bitches have no proof.
- Shut up.

13:45.760 --> 13:50.560
I think I could identify it.
It looked like a dick, only smaller.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.200
All right, Sam. We're gonna letyou go, OK?

13:54.280 --> 13:57.040
- We just gotta keep the evidence.
- (all) What?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.120
(bell rings)

14:02.040 --> 14:04.200
Now... you pay.

14:04.280 --> 14:06.960
- It's called citizen's castration.
- Argh!

14:07.600 --> 14:09.680
Next time, it'll be for real.

14:09.760 --> 14:13.480
- Argh! Argh!
- (crash)

14:13.880 --> 14:17.640
You stupid Sal's-Pizza-
garlic-breath-smelling motherfucker.

14:17.720 --> 14:21.040
Today is the last day of the rest of your life.

14:23.720 --> 14:26.880
Take this, Ford,
as payment for a job well done.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.080
It's solid gold. It'll make sure
you're not late for other clients.

14:31.160 --> 14:33.520
- No, money's fine, really.
- Bye, Ford.

14:33.600 --> 14:36.120
- You're our hero.
- You're the greatest.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.560
(mimicking) "Bye, Ford."

14:42.080 --> 14:47.320
Let me cheer you up, Ford.
I've got the INXS payment.

14:47.400 --> 14:49.400
There you go. G'day!

14:49.480 --> 14:52.640
- They say it's worth three grand.
- (koala chatters)

14:52.720 --> 14:57.400
Fuckin' Australians. I hate that country.
Continent, whatever the hell it is.

14:57.480 --> 15:02.120
Don't we do nuclear testing there?
What is that? Some kind of giant mouse?

15:02.400 --> 15:04.520
Down. Down and eat.

15:04.600 --> 15:08.640
Milli Vanilli paid us off
in bicycle shorts and hair extensions.

15:09.760 --> 15:11.760
Very scary.

15:12.960 --> 15:16.240
Rock stars. I'm goin' out
of my mind dealin' with rock stars.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.400
I don't make money, I make gifts.

15:18.480 --> 15:22.080
How am I supposed to pay taxes
with bathtub compact disc players...

15:22.160 --> 15:24.280
..and autographed drumsticks, you know?

15:24.360 --> 15:29.200
I need cash, moolah, wampum. Dead
presidents, Michael Jackson, Gerald Ford.

15:30.520 --> 15:32.880
I think it's coming together. You need money.

15:32.960 --> 15:35.760
Come on, Jazz. I got my balls in a bunch.

15:35.840 --> 15:40.840
Your karate class costs money. Cavities
cost money. Propa-pylactics cost money.

15:40.920 --> 15:45.000
Know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna take
that food processor Neil Diamond gave me...

15:45.080 --> 15:48.680
..and make koala burgers,
with koala chips and koala dip.

15:48.760 --> 15:52.240
- That's what I think.
- You're breaking my heart, Ford.

15:52.720 --> 15:55.200
Look. I thinkthat we've got a case.

15:55.280 --> 15:59.000
If we can make it through
this cavalcade of bimbos.

15:59.880 --> 16:03.520
Hi, Ford. It's Monica. Remember me?

16:03.600 --> 16:06.200
I'm walking again. Call me.

16:06.280 --> 16:09.880
- That's Bimbo No.1.
- Hey, cut the play-by-play, all right?

16:10.320 --> 16:13.920
Hi. Is this Chevy Nova?
Is this the car I want to speak to?

16:14.000 --> 16:18.360
Johnny Crunch here, KDRT.
You know- K-DIRT, you schmuck?

16:18.440 --> 16:23.600
You know, I'm the guy who had sex with your
prom date the very night before the prom.

16:23.680 --> 16:26.840
And then I became the hottest DJ in the west.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.480
Well, I got a case for you.
I don't wantyou to come here and say...

16:30.560 --> 16:32.960
.."Is it a leather case or a vinyl case?"

16:33.040 --> 16:38.560
No. It's a case to solve. Come down
to the station about six. Make it six.

16:38.640 --> 16:43.280
Johnny Teitelbaum, calling himself
Johnny Crunch. Knock me out, huh?

16:43.360 --> 16:48.120
You know, we grew up together in Brooklyn.
Came out here to become rock stars.

16:48.200 --> 16:53.080
He's lying about the prom-date thing,
of course. I hope he is. I took his sister.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.120
You're friends with the most
obnoxious asshole on the airwaves?

16:57.200 --> 16:59.680
The king of the shock jocks?

16:59.760 --> 17:02.080
- I'm shocked.
- Don't worry about it.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.000
He wants to see me at six. What time is it?

17:05.079 --> 17:08.839
- Take this. I think you might need it.
- (phone rings)

17:08.920 --> 17:11.480
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- (modem tone)

17:11.560 --> 17:17.079
That's for me. Radio contests?
Really, Ford. Howtacky.

17:17.520 --> 17:19.599
So, what are you gonna do about this watch?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.960
Keep it. It's your paycheckthis month.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.440
That's nice. What about last month?

17:24.800 --> 17:26.800
Come here. Come here.

17:27.800 --> 17:30.840
Come here.
I wanna tell you something. Come here.

17:33.680 --> 17:36.400
Huh? Huh?

17:37.040 --> 17:39.040
Unbelievable.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.720
When Johnny and I broke up our band,
we drifted apart.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.960
He started hanging out with all those rock
star hairhead types, like the late Bobby Black.

17:52.040 --> 17:56.080
And when they needed money to get high,
they did RockAgainst Drugs commercials.

17:56.160 --> 17:59.440
You see what I'm sayin'?
That's what I'm sayin'. What am I sayin'?

17:59.520 --> 18:02.000
I don't know.

18:02.080 --> 18:05.120
Hey, Pixie. I'm here to see Johnny Crunch.

18:05.560 --> 18:07.560
Lucky you. Arnie.

18:10.800 --> 18:14.120
Mr Crunch has a lot of fans
who hate his guts.

18:17.040 --> 18:21.280
Oh, Arnie. Sometimes when we touch
the honesty's too much.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.240
Sorry.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.120
It's Johnny Crunch here.

18:26.200 --> 18:31.520
As always, if we call you and you answer the
phone by saying "Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT",...

18:31.600 --> 18:33.200
..you could win a cool million.

18:33.520 --> 18:36.440
At K-DIRT, we play
the kind of music your mother hates.

18:36.520 --> 18:41.560
I know, because right now, she's naked
under the desk swallowing my microphone.

18:41.640 --> 18:44.920
She likes that. Oops. I broke it accidentally.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.160
Seriously, I make jokes aboutyour mothers,...

18:47.240 --> 18:52.600
..but I knowthey're just pathetic sluts
who have no lives and have sex with midgets.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.280
(rock)

18:57.360 --> 19:02.640
Johnny Teitelbaum. Gettin' paid
to be the asshole you always were, huh?

19:03.160 --> 19:05.360
Suzuki Samurai.

19:05.440 --> 19:08.440
You Bensonhurst piece of shit.

19:08.520 --> 19:12.640
Here we are, still in Los Angeles,
two rock 'n' roll dicks.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.960
Only you're the detective
and I'm just a regular dick.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.280
It was nice hearin' from you
after you hit it big, you rat.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.440
I guess your arms were amputated
and you couldn't pick up a phone.

19:23.520 --> 19:26.920
But this is not a social call.
Here, take a look at that.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.960
Yeah. Real nice. So?

19:32.040 --> 19:34.640
She's my daughter.

19:35.880 --> 19:40.280
She calls herself Zuzu Petals.

19:40.360 --> 19:44.000
It's the sickest thing.
You see, years ago, I was in Jersey.

19:44.080 --> 19:47.360
I meet this girl.
She's a total pig, but I fucked her.

19:47.440 --> 19:49.480
Yeah, I heard you started dating.

19:50.880 --> 19:55.760
Well, she gets pregnant, she has the kid,
the kid grows up, moves out here.

19:55.840 --> 20:00.240
And, you know, typical story. She's screwin'
with all the rock stars, takin' drugs.

20:00.320 --> 20:04.320
And I lost track of her. And I want her back.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.040
Cos she's my daughter, my pride and joy.

20:08.640 --> 20:13.320
I don't take cases with foundations
in bullshit. They're hard to walk around in.

20:13.600 --> 20:16.520
- OK. You found me out.
- Level with me, Johnny.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.960
All right. She's my sister. She's my daughter.
She's my sister and my daughter.

20:21.040 --> 20:25.080
Look at the picture
and find her and bring her backto me.

20:25.160 --> 20:32.800
I've been told it might be hard to pay your
rent with gold records and koala bears. OK?

20:33.200 --> 20:38.600
Maybe this'll make it
a little more attractive to you. $4,000.

20:44.640 --> 20:48.560
- Zuzu Petals, huh?
- Zuzu Petals.

20:48.640 --> 20:53.840
So I hope you... Nah, I know
you're gonna find her cos you're the best.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.920
Guys like you, you do grow on trees.

20:58.360 --> 21:01.040
You're OK, Johnny. Here's to you...

21:02.600 --> 21:04.920
(both) Sucking my dick.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.600
Ah, let me get outta here.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.960
No dessert until after you finish your dinner.

21:19.560 --> 21:23.720
Money, money, money, money, money... Argh.

21:23.800 --> 21:27.840
How hard could it be to nail down
one teenage blonde groupie in LA?

21:30.360 --> 21:34.840
(Johnny) Any teenage virgins,
show up with a jar of petroleum jelly...

21:34.920 --> 21:37.720
..right now,
and ask to speak to Johnny Crunch.

21:37.800 --> 21:40.240
I never even liked the bastard.

21:41.840 --> 21:45.440
2,000 private investigators in Los Angeles.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.480
So why did I pickthe music industry? Well...

21:49.560 --> 21:51.560
It made sense to specialise.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.200
I coulda been anything.
I coulda been a fisherman.

21:56.280 --> 21:59.080
Fishermen, they get up in the morning.

21:59.160 --> 22:02.840
They fish. They sell fish. They smell fish.

22:02.920 --> 22:07.960
Reminds me of this girl I used to go with,
Yvonne. She smelled like fish.

22:08.040 --> 22:11.480
- (gunshot on radio)
- (Johnny) Someone shot my engineer. Hey.

22:11.560 --> 22:15.240
Hey, let go of the mike. What are you... Hey.

22:15.320 --> 22:18.680
Someone call the cops. Help me.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.320
Please, let go of me. Let me go!

22:27.600 --> 22:31.400
These LA drivers, man.
How do they get their licence?

22:31.480 --> 22:33.480
(Johnny screams)

22:34.760 --> 22:36.760
(horns blare)

22:39.120 --> 22:43.520
I'm being electrocuted!
I'm being... Help me!

22:43.600 --> 22:47.560
- It hurts! Argh!
- Call the cops. Johnny's being electrocuted.

22:47.640 --> 22:52.160
- Oh, please. It's just one of his stupid jokes.
- Oh, fucking shit, my Christ!

22:52.240 --> 22:56.160
Hey! He can't say "Oh, fucking shit,
my Christ" over the air.

22:56.240 --> 23:00.040
- Hey, Arnie. Your fly.
- Please let go of me! That's hot!

23:00.120 --> 23:05.160
They're hot! Please! Please!
I'm being electrocuted! No! No! Argh!

23:05.240 --> 23:07.760
Argh! Argh! Argh!

23:09.640 --> 23:11.800
Johnny!

23:14.280 --> 23:17.440
Let's get another angle on this one.

23:17.520 --> 23:19.520
Just a couple more.

23:19.600 --> 23:21.840
It was dead air for the DJ.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.200
Friend of yours?

23:27.480 --> 23:29.480
Yeah. And my client.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.480
- I could cry.
- It's all right to cry, Ford.

23:40.560 --> 23:42.560
Crying's good.

23:43.920 --> 23:45.320
Oh, shit.

23:51.200 --> 23:55.320
How'd Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective
boogie his way in here? Anybody?

23:55.960 --> 23:59.280
He discovered the body, sir.
LieutenantAmos, sir.

23:59.360 --> 24:03.520
Oh, Fairlane, please confess.
I'll do the execution myself.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.520
Nice tie, LieutenantAnus, sir.

24:07.600 --> 24:09.680
Are you calling me an asshole, asshole?

24:09.760 --> 24:12.920
I'm calling you an anus, Anus.
But if you prefer...

24:13.600 --> 24:16.800
You think you're so hot
because you get in all the clubs...

24:16.880 --> 24:19.120
..and have sex with great-lookin' women.

24:19.200 --> 24:22.880
You think you're so hot just cos
you broke the Ensenada tape piracy ring.

24:22.960 --> 24:27.000
- You gotta admit those are good reasons.
- Get the fuck outta here, jerk-off.

24:27.080 --> 24:31.520
Jerk-off? You're a jerk-off.
That's what I think of you.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.880
No, that's what I call you
because you are a jerk-off.

24:36.520 --> 24:39.160
- Jerk-off.
- Get the fuck outta here.

24:40.200 --> 24:43.720
I did every shit job in the biz
before I became a superhero.

24:43.800 --> 24:48.600
Roadie, publicist, Jimmy Osmond's
bodyguard and personal secretary...

24:48.680 --> 24:50.560
Hey, I may bitch about my job,...

24:50.640 --> 24:55.120
..but a great clue can really take a nothing day
and make it seem worthwhile.

24:55.200 --> 24:59.640
"ArtMooney." This case is getting closed!

25:01.240 --> 25:05.040
Ford. What are you running from?

25:08.800 --> 25:11.080
You told me to get the fuck outta here.

25:11.160 --> 25:15.480
Oh, if you're hiding something,
oh, oh... I'll have so much fun.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.520
Anus, what's the bug up your ass?
Why do you hate me so much?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.600
Why do I hate you?
I'll give you a fuckin' hint. Two words.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.840
- Disco Express.
- Disco Express?

25:25.280 --> 25:30.200
Are you dealin' in beads or what? I mean, that
group blew dog, you know what I'm sayin'?

25:30.280 --> 25:32.600
Hey, Anus. They had that...

25:32.680 --> 25:37.960
That single, that real shitty single they
wanted me to push during my publicist days.

25:38.040 --> 25:40.560
- "Booty Time".
- Yeah, with that lead singer,...

25:40.640 --> 25:44.600
..the white Van McCoy lookalike
with the six-inch platform shoes.

25:44.680 --> 25:47.680
- You know, he looked like...
- Like me.

25:47.760 --> 25:51.520
Yeah. I was gonna say he looked like shit,
but... He looked like you.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.320
(disco)

25:53.400 --> 25:56.600
Booty time, booty time, across the USA

25:56.920 --> 26:00.000
Booty time, booty time, hey-hey-hey

26:00.080 --> 26:03.840
-Whoo! Booty time, booty time
-Booty time, booty time, across the USA

26:03.920 --> 26:06.080
-lt's booty time, booty time
-Booty time, booty time

26:06.160 --> 26:08.720
-Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- (music stops)

26:08.800 --> 26:12.800
Unbelievable. I didn't think anything
could cheer me up tonight, Lieutenant.

26:12.880 --> 26:15.720
But that brilliant performance...

26:15.800 --> 26:17.480
Jerk-off.

26:17.560 --> 26:19.560
Booty time! Boot my balls.

26:35.280 --> 26:38.760
Can't believe he won't be alive to piss me off.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.720
Here's to you, Johnny.

26:59.520 --> 27:01.520
(koala whines)

27:09.920 --> 27:13.160
- Ouch.
- Hey, you. Get off my cloud.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.240
Really.

27:16.160 --> 27:19.000
I'm hanging out with my best friend.

27:19.080 --> 27:22.000
1962 Fender Stratocaster.

27:22.080 --> 27:24.200
Original pick-ups, maple neck,...

27:24.280 --> 27:28.080
..strung upside-down for
a left-handed motherfuckin' genius.

27:28.160 --> 27:31.240
- Jimi Hendrix.
- Who cares, man? I got a case.

27:31.560 --> 27:35.760
- Yeah, what? A 12-pack?
- This ain't a social call, man.

27:35.840 --> 27:37.960
A hundred bucks to find my dad.

27:38.680 --> 27:42.000
What? What, did he just
say what I think he said?

27:42.080 --> 27:45.040
Man, don't worry. I got a clue.
See this ring on my finger?

27:45.120 --> 27:49.280
Well, before my old lady ran off to Baja,
she told me my dad had this exact same ring.

27:49.360 --> 27:50.800
Yabba-dabba-doo!

27:50.880 --> 27:54.440
Holy Colonel Mustard.
Jeepers, you didn't mention the big clue.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.720
Come on. I can't take your money.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.400
You need it.

27:59.480 --> 28:02.000
I don't need it that bad.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.880
(knocking at door)

28:08.120 --> 28:10.120
I can't believe I tookthe money.

28:19.280 --> 28:21.560
- Ford Fairlane?
- Yeah.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.800
I'm Colleen Sutton.

28:24.880 --> 28:27.160
I need your help.

28:27.240 --> 28:32.680
I have a problem, and it pertains to
the music industry. What is it they call you?

28:34.040 --> 28:38.760
- Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective?
- Please, save it. It's too early.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.160
Just make yourself comfortable.

28:45.560 --> 28:47.560
- Some juice?
- Please.

28:55.280 --> 28:59.360
Sorry about the glass,
the house and my breath.

29:00.320 --> 29:05.560
Mr Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich
that warps minds. Nothing offends me.

29:05.640 --> 29:09.920
When I was 11, I walked in on
my father and the Shetland pony he gave me.

29:12.160 --> 29:15.760
- Does that excite you?
- I don't know. I never metyour father.

29:19.440 --> 29:21.960
Oh, that? Don't take it personal.

29:22.040 --> 29:26.520
He normally gets up a half hour before I do,
you know? Come on. Down, boy.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.520
Down, Stanley. Roseanne Barr naked.

29:30.400 --> 29:32.400
- Gone.
- (growls)

29:35.600 --> 29:37.600
- Stanley?
- Yeah. Stanley.

29:37.680 --> 29:40.120
You know. Like the power drill?

29:41.840 --> 29:44.160
I had to ask.

29:44.240 --> 29:46.240
So tell me, who's your decorator?

29:46.320 --> 29:49.080
Some fag. Charged me up the ass, you know?

29:49.160 --> 29:53.160
Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?

29:53.240 --> 29:57.160
Yeah, in poor taste. Hey, I got
nothing against homosexuals, you know?

29:57.240 --> 30:00.320
I even got one of these friends,
one of these trans-testicles.

30:00.400 --> 30:02.720
(laughs)

30:02.800 --> 30:05.600
Trans...testicle?

30:06.240 --> 30:10.200
- I don't have a sense of humour either. Sorry.
- No shit?

30:10.280 --> 30:12.320
("Purple Haze" by Jimi Hendrix)

30:12.400 --> 30:14.320
Help me

30:14.400 --> 30:15.400
Help...

30:18.560 --> 30:20.960
Well, nowthat we've broken the ice...

30:22.960 --> 30:26.280
I need you to find my little sister.
She goes by the name of Zuzu...

30:26.360 --> 30:29.920
Petals. Yeah. I know.
You want me to get her back...

30:30.000 --> 30:34.800
..because you don't want her to become the
biggest sleazebag slut on the Sunset Strip,...

30:34.880 --> 30:36.960
..because she's your pride and joy.

30:37.400 --> 30:39.400
How did you know?

30:40.440 --> 30:43.280
- Here. Take this picture.
- No, thanks.

30:44.160 --> 30:46.160
I got my own.

30:46.520 --> 30:49.000
Excuse me?

30:50.200 --> 30:53.120
Let's see. You're her worried sister, right?

30:53.200 --> 30:57.440
Yesterday, I met her worried father, who,
by the way, is five years younger than you.

30:57.520 --> 31:01.840
Then I capped off the evening by watching
this guy go off like a pack of firecrackers.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.920
They write about cases like this
in the private eye handbook, honey.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.360
Something about a ten-foot pole.

31:10.560 --> 31:13.840
5,000 should satisfy any qualms
you have about my family tree.

31:13.920 --> 31:16.120
Yeah, but for now I only get a 20, right?

31:16.200 --> 31:18.600
Actually, you may take it all now.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.920
Is that real money?

31:24.080 --> 31:26.680
- I got some questions.
- I have no answers.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.280
Thanks for the stain. Find the girl.

31:34.440 --> 31:36.440
You know, speaking of stains...

31:38.920 --> 31:42.360
I was just discussing bleaches
with my friend Art Mooney.

31:44.120 --> 31:45.120
Who?

31:48.440 --> 31:50.680
Zuzu Petals.

31:50.760 --> 31:52.760
Never seen her before.

31:52.840 --> 31:57.800
And as for who would wanna kill Johnny
Crunch, the line forms to the left.

31:57.880 --> 32:02.360
I can tell you that he moved onto
a sailboat at the Delta Marina last week.

32:02.440 --> 32:04.440
Thanks.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.840
- Hey, great pipes, huh?
- (laughter)

32:07.960 --> 32:10.560
I've heard cats fuck
with more harmony than this kid.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.880
Tell me about it. The name's Kyle Troy.

32:13.520 --> 32:16.200
(Ford) What's with
this freak of fuckin' nature?

32:17.120 --> 32:20.120
How does Grendel Records sign
such a wick-prick, huh?

32:20.200 --> 32:25.440
But then again, Julie Grendel thinks
Jethro Tull's one of the Beverly Hillbillies.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.080
My mother always said that...

32:33.320 --> 32:36.200
..if you can't say
something nice about someone,...

32:36.280 --> 32:39.040
..make sure they're
out of the goddamn room.

32:43.520 --> 32:47.320
Hello, Ford. I'm Julian Grendel.

32:49.320 --> 32:52.360
Julie Grendel. Right. Right.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.200
Hey, I'm sorry.

32:55.880 --> 33:00.920
Do you realise we're gonna have
to ship this "wick-prick" platinum,...

33:01.000 --> 33:05.360
..just so the teenage girls will have
a compact disc cover to get wet with?

33:05.920 --> 33:08.880
Come on, you gotta know
better than anybody that...

33:08.960 --> 33:12.680
..there's a lot more to
the music industry than actual music.

33:12.760 --> 33:17.320
You just have to learn to tune it out.
I recommend Stravinsky and Wagner.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.960
I recommend Smith and Wesson.

33:21.880 --> 33:25.000
I'm sorry to hear about Bobby Black.

33:25.680 --> 33:27.720
Terrible thing.

33:27.800 --> 33:29.800
But a great career move.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.040
His records are really climbing the charts.

33:34.120 --> 33:38.840
I just gotta make sure that this Kyle Troy...
Is that his name?

33:39.640 --> 33:45.120
Anyway, this Kyle Troy person
is the next... big thing.

33:46.440 --> 33:51.520
You know, I was just discussing this whole
Troy thing with my old buddy Art Mooney.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.600
You know him?

33:53.680 --> 33:56.000
Nope.

33:56.080 --> 33:58.080
No, huh?

33:59.680 --> 34:02.400
(Don) What is this asshole smiling about?

34:02.480 --> 34:06.320
Sorry, Ford,
I couldn't help you with your case.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.840
Ford? Ford?

34:10.159 --> 34:11.840
Hey, Pavarotti.

34:11.920 --> 34:14.400
- Hey, what's the hassle?
- Hassle? What is this?

34:14.480 --> 34:17.360
(imitates Kyle singing) What is that shit, huh?

34:17.440 --> 34:20.400
I could crack my knuckles
with more rhythm than that.

34:20.480 --> 34:23.080
You're killin' rock and rapin' roll, man.

34:23.159 --> 34:27.320
Keith Richards is rollin' over in his grave.
The friggin' guy isn't even dead yet.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.400
- You're tearin' me apart.
- Hey.

34:29.480 --> 34:32.600
Hey. No, no, no.
Restyour lips. Put down the earmuffs.

34:32.679 --> 34:34.920
Go ahead. Go ahead. Good, good.

34:35.000 --> 34:37.719
Rock 'n' roll.
You know what rock 'n' roll is?

34:38.080 --> 34:42.159
- What's Ford doin', man?
- Guys, work with me, huh?

34:47.800 --> 34:50.400
I got a '65 Cadillac

34:50.480 --> 34:52.760
Spare tyre on the back

34:53.000 --> 34:55.199
Charge card to Goldblatt's

34:55.280 --> 34:57.600
But I ain't gotyou

34:57.680 --> 34:59.960
I got women to the right of me

35:00.040 --> 35:02.480
I got women to the left of me

35:02.560 --> 35:04.880
I got chicks all around me

35:04.960 --> 35:07.320
But I ain't gotyou

35:07.400 --> 35:09.800
I got a tab at the liquor store

35:09.880 --> 35:12.160
I hit the number 444

35:12.240 --> 35:14.440
I got a mojo, and don'tyou know

35:14.520 --> 35:16.920
I'm all dressed up and no place to go

35:17.000 --> 35:19.240
-I got women to the left of me
-Yeah, yeah

35:19.320 --> 35:21.800
-I got women to the right of me
-Yeah, yeah

35:21.880 --> 35:24.400
-I got chicks all around me
- Yeah, yeah

35:24.480 --> 35:26.800
But I ain't gotyou

35:26.880 --> 35:29.480
-No, I ain't gotyou
-Ow!

35:43.880 --> 35:46.240
-I got a closet full of clothes
-Yeah, yeah

35:46.320 --> 35:48.480
-And no matter when it goes
- Yeah, yeah

35:48.560 --> 35:51.160
-I got a ring in my nose
-Yeah, yeah

35:51.240 --> 35:53.600
But I ain't gotyou

35:53.680 --> 35:55.280
But I ain't gotyou

35:55.360 --> 35:57.480
Yeah, I ain't gotyou

35:58.400 --> 36:00.680
No, I ain't gotyou

36:03.560 --> 36:07.400
Kid... nowthat's rock 'n' roll, huh?

36:09.560 --> 36:11.000
Jesus!

36:11.080 --> 36:15.800
I coulda been a rock star,
if only I wasn't bannedfrom MTV.

36:16.040 --> 36:20.520
Hey, it's a long story.
Unfortunately, I can only do that one song.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.360
Well, I also do a mean "Puff
the Magic Dragon", but only in the nude.

36:24.440 --> 36:26.520
It's a longer story. Oh!

36:27.160 --> 36:29.760
- You guys a band?
- Sure.

36:30.800 --> 36:33.480
- Got a name?
- Yeah. Pain.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.040
Pain. Kooky.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.360
When Don Cleveland told me
Johnny had a boat on the Delta Marina,...

36:46.440 --> 36:48.480
..lforgot to ask the name of it.

36:48.560 --> 36:51.200
I had a feeling
Johnny had been hidingfrom someone.

36:51.280 --> 36:56.120
So the name of the boat was gonna be
something different from his personality.

36:58.720 --> 37:00.800
Well, maybe not.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.520
Johnny was the only guy
who could out-disgust me.

37:22.600 --> 37:25.520
When we were kids,
we'd have gross-out contests.

37:25.600 --> 37:28.080
I'd cough a pile of phlegm on the table.

37:28.160 --> 37:31.880
He'd say "Nice try" and then pull out a straw.

37:31.960 --> 37:33.320
- (squeaks)
- Ouch.

37:34.080 --> 37:36.360
("Last Time in Paris" by Queensrÿche)

37:36.440 --> 37:38.520
(squeaks)

37:38.600 --> 37:42.360
Love boat, takin' another run...

37:45.200 --> 37:49.920
The dumb bastard got involved with
something or someone he shouldn't have.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.280
"Collie and me."

37:59.360 --> 38:02.880
I'm a big Lassie fan,
so lfigured I'd take a break.

38:02.960 --> 38:05.040
I hope it's the one where... Yow!

38:05.120 --> 38:07.480
I'm a... I'm a pit bull. I'm a pit bull.

38:07.560 --> 38:10.680
I'm a bad pit bull. Where's my Queen Colleen?

38:14.920 --> 38:17.280
Queen Colleen's here.

38:17.360 --> 38:19.280
What is this, the Rob Lowe channel?

38:19.360 --> 38:23.080
- Oh, yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Oh, what a cute little doggie.

38:23.160 --> 38:28.080
"I'm very rich. Nothing offends me."
Come on. Nothin'? No shit, honey.

38:28.160 --> 38:31.880
You got a whip stickin' out of your ass
and a guy that's fuckin' barkin'.

38:31.960 --> 38:34.040
Bad dog. Bad dog. Down. Down.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.120
Sit.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.800
Why was Colleen so interested in Johnny?

38:54.880 --> 38:57.880
Maybe they had the same taste in antiques.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.640
Hello, hello.

39:16.040 --> 39:20.960
You're ten seconds from the most
embarrassing moment of your fuckin' life.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.160
(laughs maniacally)

39:37.080 --> 39:38.120
Fuck!

39:41.440 --> 39:43.720
Argh! Argh!

39:43.800 --> 39:45.800
(giggling)

39:46.240 --> 39:48.800
Damn.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.320
lfelt like I'd just
played water polo in a urine tank.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.400
Who was that smiling snapper-head?

40:16.480 --> 40:19.600
Why was he trying to scare me off the case?
Who's he workingfor?

40:19.680 --> 40:24.760
More important, I got a school of guppies
in my underwear now. Nobody believes me.

40:26.120 --> 40:28.120
(phone rings)

40:29.160 --> 40:32.640
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- Hey, Jazz. What's goin' on?

40:32.720 --> 40:35.080
Bimbos and bill collectors. You?

40:35.160 --> 40:38.240
- Took a late-night swim, you know?
- Uh-huh. How refreshing.

40:38.320 --> 40:41.560
I got a party I wantyou to come to
tomorrow. Could be interesting.

40:41.640 --> 40:45.320
It's at Colleen Sutton's Bel Air estate.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.560
So dress nice, OK, honey?

40:47.640 --> 40:49.640
- OK.
- Love you, baby.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.400
(man sings "Give Me the Simple Life')

41:03.720 --> 41:06.040
(Ford) Oh, man, do I hate the rich.

41:09.920 --> 41:11.920
Robin Leach?

41:12.600 --> 41:15.160
I fucked him. Oh!

41:15.240 --> 41:17.920
Give me the simple life

41:18.000 --> 41:20.840
- So you want off the case?
- Not quite.

41:20.920 --> 41:23.640
I've got a code, Queen Collie.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.360
I never, ever drop a case.

41:27.360 --> 41:31.560
Besides, I used all your money
to pay my bills, so I sort of owe you.

41:32.600 --> 41:36.320
I don't need money.
What I need are questions answered.

41:36.400 --> 41:39.520
Question number one.

41:39.600 --> 41:42.000
Can I have some money?

41:42.080 --> 41:44.240
I'm only kidding.

41:44.320 --> 41:46.320
Hey, look.

41:46.400 --> 41:49.040
Johnny Crunch was a good friend of mine.

41:49.120 --> 41:54.280
He didn't bark like a dog for me.
However, I want to know why he had to die.

41:54.720 --> 41:57.280
Look. No one told you to solve a murder.

41:57.360 --> 41:59.360
Just find a girl.

42:12.760 --> 42:15.280
Excuse me a moment... honey.

42:20.120 --> 42:26.760
Jazz, I told you to dress nice, not nice.
I mean, what did you thinkthis was? A date?

42:28.200 --> 42:31.640
All right, look, sweetheart. You look beautiful.

42:31.720 --> 42:34.960
Afterwards, I'll take you out,
throw a burger down your throat...

42:35.040 --> 42:38.360
You're truly a man among men.
What do you want from me?

42:38.440 --> 42:41.480
Look. This Colleen Sutton chick
I was just rappin' with?

42:41.560 --> 42:43.920
She's full of surprises and full of shit, OK?

42:44.160 --> 42:46.920
I wantyou to secretly
keep tabs on her for me.

42:47.000 --> 42:49.640
All right. Good. Hey, wait. Hors devors.

42:50.800 --> 42:53.720
Snapper-head. Hey, food boy.

42:54.280 --> 42:56.480
Where the hell are you goin'?

42:56.960 --> 43:00.840
Some like the high road, I like the low road

43:00.920 --> 43:04.480
Free from the care and strife

43:04.560 --> 43:06.760
Sounds corny and seedy

43:06.840 --> 43:08.840
Butyes, indeedy

43:09.120 --> 43:11.680
Give me the simple life

43:18.320 --> 43:20.640
Ah! Stop following me.

43:20.720 --> 43:23.240
- Excuse me. I was...
- Give it up, girl.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.600
Just take this.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.840
I can't afford to have it right now.

43:28.960 --> 43:30.960
Oh! Ooh.

43:41.760 --> 43:43.760
Ugh.

43:45.400 --> 43:47.400
Hello, Ford.

43:49.600 --> 43:51.600
- I'm hip.
- Mm.

43:51.680 --> 43:55.680
Well, I must say, you're
an island of reality in an ocean of diarrhoea.

43:56.920 --> 44:01.000
And the ones who love inside

44:01.080 --> 44:05.360
Some like the high road, I like the low road

44:05.440 --> 44:06.880
Why mess around...

44:06.960 --> 44:11.040
It's good to see you too, Julie.
Say hello to my assistant, Jazz.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.280
- Hi.
- Mm.

44:15.720 --> 44:20.440
Ford. I thinkthat somebody's
trying to rip my company off.

44:20.880 --> 44:24.520
I've tried the Yellow Pages.
Now I think it's your turn.

44:24.800 --> 44:26.640
Shark is served.

44:30.600 --> 44:34.840
I guess now is a bad time to discuss it.
I'm such a big fan of shark meat.

44:35.880 --> 44:39.200
- So nice to meetyou.
- (gags) Nice to meetyou.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.960
See you.

44:43.760 --> 44:45.520
Come on, Ford.

44:46.640 --> 44:48.640
Your shark steak, sir.

44:50.480 --> 44:53.920
What are you lookin' at?
What's the matter with you? Hey, Jazz.

44:54.000 --> 44:58.120
- What? You gotyour panties in a bunch?
- Shut up. Look down the back of my dress.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.400
Whoa!

45:00.480 --> 45:04.280
- This party's pickin' up.
- Come on, come on, come on, come on.

45:07.320 --> 45:11.000
- Where'd you get this?
- A gift from the ice queen, Colleen.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.360
And it's not even my birthday.

45:13.440 --> 45:16.640
I wouldn't trust that babe
as far as I could bowl her.

45:16.720 --> 45:19.080
Found out she'd been nailin' Johnny.

45:19.160 --> 45:21.400
Don't even ask aboutZuzu Petals.

45:24.880 --> 45:25.960
(beeping)

45:26.040 --> 45:28.400
Play that funky music, white boy.

45:28.480 --> 45:31.720
It's a computer disc. Let me check it out.

45:31.800 --> 45:34.480
I knew Colleen had something up her sleeve.

45:35.680 --> 45:37.680
You did good.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.840
Why don'tyou make eye contact
when you say that?

45:40.920 --> 45:43.640
I can't. That dress. I mean, why don't we just...

45:43.720 --> 45:48.920
Celebrate? Like when we solved the case of
the Bad White Bluesman? Forget that, man.

45:49.000 --> 45:51.160
Jazz... Come here.

45:57.760 --> 46:00.280
Maybe I should be thankful
that was a foodless kiss.

46:00.360 --> 46:04.600
We had such a great weekend, you know.
You had a good time, I had a good time...

46:04.680 --> 46:10.840
OK. Why don'tyou just stop, before
you make some crude reference to Stanley.

46:10.920 --> 46:13.120
Hey, Stanley had a good time too, you know.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.960
Yeah? Well, that weekend was a mistake.

46:16.280 --> 46:19.560
Hey, look. I'm sorry I made you
clean the toilets and the bathtubs.

46:19.640 --> 46:21.720
I mean, who did all the work in bed?

46:23.320 --> 46:25.840
- Oh.
- Oh, come... Jazz! I'm...

46:25.920 --> 46:28.680
- (growls)
- What'd I say? Come on.

46:29.000 --> 46:31.040
Chicks.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.160
Some people play hard to get.

46:33.440 --> 46:35.440
I play hard to want.

46:35.520 --> 46:39.880
I'd always loved Jazz,
cos she despised me for who I truly am.

46:39.960 --> 46:43.920
Like that time we were at her parents'
wedding anniversary and I told that joke:

46:44.000 --> 46:46.000
.."What's the definition of vagina?"

46:46.080 --> 46:49.600
"The box a penis comes in." Oh!

46:51.960 --> 46:55.920
I was stuck with a case where Zuzu Petals
and ArtMooney were battling out...

46:56.000 --> 46:58.680
..for the "Lamest Clue of My Career" award.

47:00.160 --> 47:03.520
It's just me and you tonight, honey.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.720
What are you doin'?

47:05.800 --> 47:09.680
Look at the mess you're makin', huh?
Who's gonna clean that up?

47:14.720 --> 47:18.480
I'm Kurt Loder on MTV News. Police
say that Black Plague singer Bobby Black...

47:18.560 --> 47:21.600
..was not the victim of a drug overdose
as was at first suspected.

47:21.680 --> 47:24.920
Police have no suspects yet
and are asking all Black Plague fans...

47:25.000 --> 47:29.560
..not to show up at the funeral, which will be
held at the Hollywood Cemetery at midnight.

47:29.640 --> 47:33.920
Right now, as a tribute,
here's the lastvideo by Bobby Black.

47:56.920 --> 47:59.120
Would you look at that?

48:13.120 --> 48:16.560
So Zuzu Petals was
a groupie of Bobby Black's.

48:16.960 --> 48:20.200
What did Bobby's friends
Johnny and Colleen want from her?

48:20.280 --> 48:26.000
I'd hoped to find out at Bobby's funeral,
cos this case was gettin' closed.

48:30.720 --> 48:33.280
All right. That's 100 each. Come on.

48:33.360 --> 48:36.800
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Right. Get in there.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.080
Got those Plague invites here.

48:42.240 --> 48:45.280
Scalpin' at a funeral.
You're a pretty sleazy guy.

48:45.360 --> 48:48.120
Thanks. You interested?
It's festival seating, so...

48:48.200 --> 48:50.400
- How much?
- 300.

48:50.480 --> 48:54.400
- 300? You charged the chicks one.
- Hey, they blew me.

48:55.880 --> 48:57.880
300 comin' up.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.880
Bobby!

49:11.880 --> 49:14.160
Jeez. Am I the only one that paid full price?

49:17.080 --> 49:21.280
Ever see this chick before?
Ever see this chick?

49:21.360 --> 49:23.360
He was so good.

49:26.160 --> 49:29.360
He was one of the greats.
Ever see this chick around?

49:31.120 --> 49:33.160
Is this a trick question?

49:39.080 --> 49:42.160
Zuzu Petals? Zuzu Petals?

49:42.240 --> 49:44.200
Yes! Who killed Bobby Black?

49:44.280 --> 49:47.280
- Um...
- Who killed Johnny? Who's Art Mooney?

49:47.360 --> 49:49.640
- Talkto me. Talkto me!
- I don't know.

49:49.720 --> 49:52.040
I'm so scared. Help me.

49:52.280 --> 49:54.640
Hey, baby. A simple thank you would suffice.

49:54.960 --> 49:57.280
Fluck you!

49:57.640 --> 50:00.920
Oh, fluck. Fluck. Stanley, talkto me.

50:06.920 --> 50:09.800
- Hello, hello.
- Argh!

50:12.720 --> 50:14.720
(Zuzu screams)

50:32.760 --> 50:34.760
- Damn.
- (phone rings)

50:36.680 --> 50:39.520
- Hit pay dirt with K-DIRT.
- Hello, hello.

50:40.560 --> 50:42.560
Radio contests, Ford.

50:43.880 --> 50:47.360
- Come on, man.
- Hey. Aren'tyou supposed to be dead?

50:47.440 --> 50:49.520
Why don'tyou come back, you chickenshit?

50:49.600 --> 50:53.880
Oh, Ford.
I wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.

50:53.960 --> 50:56.240
- Watch out. Get out of the way.
- (screams)

51:04.440 --> 51:08.400
- God, I love this job.
- And I thought all we got was a dental plan.

51:16.840 --> 51:19.200
- Hey.
- Hey. He took Lydia.

51:23.920 --> 51:25.920
Ah!

51:26.680 --> 51:28.080
Mom...

51:28.160 --> 51:30.160
(screaming)

51:33.200 --> 51:35.520
Watch out.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.600
(laughs maniacally)

51:41.360 --> 51:43.440
You ain't smilin' no more, asshole.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.000
Oh, but I am, Ford.

51:48.320 --> 51:50.680
Oh, shit!

51:50.760 --> 51:53.800
No, thanks. I've got my own.

52:05.800 --> 52:07.440
(phone rings)

52:07.520 --> 52:10.440
Fuck you, you dirtbag sack of shit.

52:11.320 --> 52:14.480
And a good evening to you too, kind sir.
Sorry to interrupt.

52:14.560 --> 52:17.880
Thoughtyou might like to know
that the CD is coming up worthless.

52:17.960 --> 52:21.280
And I also found out
why Colleen Sutton is so damn rich.

52:21.360 --> 52:27.360
Besides the Sutton Estate, she also gets
a little additional green à la alimony from...

52:27.440 --> 52:30.560
..dramatic pause... your pal Julian Grendel.

52:30.640 --> 52:35.000
- Her ex-husband.
- That explains a lot, but I can't talk now.

52:35.080 --> 52:39.480
- You're with one of your bimbos, aren'tyou?
- It's a little more complicated than that.

52:39.560 --> 52:43.040
Look... Hold on. I got another call. Hold on.

52:45.920 --> 52:48.880
Yeah, hello? Smiley?
I'm sorry. That was my assistant.

52:48.960 --> 52:51.680
Your assistant is quite special.

52:51.920 --> 52:54.560
I look forward to raping her atyour funeral.

52:57.040 --> 52:59.040
Wait. Hold on, Smiley.

52:59.120 --> 53:03.360
Come on, get. On second thought...
I'm only kidding. Come here. Come here.

53:07.240 --> 53:11.240
Damn, baby.
I hope you filled out some organ donor cards.

53:11.320 --> 53:13.560
Excuse me. Excuse me, driver?

53:13.640 --> 53:19.680
Driver? Hi. Now, I knowthis is, like,
a car chase, but I have gotto go wee-wee.

53:19.760 --> 53:23.040
So if we could just pull over,
it'd be great, at any...

53:24.080 --> 53:26.320
Hang on, baby, here we go.

53:31.080 --> 53:33.560
Come on. Come on, Smiley.

53:35.520 --> 53:37.520
- Bobby!
- Bobby!

53:41.200 --> 53:44.040
Oh, there's Bobby. Hi, sweetheart.

53:53.800 --> 53:55.880
Shit.

54:14.480 --> 54:19.360
Boy! You morticians
really know howto party.

54:20.200 --> 54:22.200
Ah! Ah!

54:28.640 --> 54:30.640
(Zuzu sighs)

54:35.520 --> 54:37.760
(gasps)

54:37.840 --> 54:39.840
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm ecstatic.

54:40.680 --> 54:42.880
Get outta the car!

54:42.960 --> 54:44.960
- (sirens approaching)
- OK.

54:59.760 --> 55:04.120
I can't believe anybody could have
so much fuckin' fun at a funeral, Fairlane.

55:04.200 --> 55:07.800
- You do Bar Mitzvahs?
- The son of a bitch you want's in this limo.

55:07.880 --> 55:11.640
Yeah, sure, whatever. You know,
I really wish I could get mad atyou, Ford.

55:11.720 --> 55:16.640
But guess who just found out
who killed Bobby Black and Johnny Crunch?

55:16.720 --> 55:21.520
A psycho groupie killer. I got an anonymous
letter says she killed the both of them.

55:21.600 --> 55:26.120
I hate to interrupt, but I think you spent
too much time in discos during the '70s.

55:26.200 --> 55:28.320
The Village People rotted your brain.

55:28.400 --> 55:31.720
That's the difference
between a great investigator like me...

55:31.800 --> 55:34.000
..and a piece of Spam like you.

55:34.600 --> 55:36.760
Spam.

55:37.120 --> 55:40.360
You're a piece of Spam.
That's what I think of you.

55:40.440 --> 55:43.720
No, I call you a piece of Spam
because that's whatyou are.

55:43.800 --> 55:45.880
Spam.

55:45.960 --> 55:48.760
See, you look at this picture,
all you see is the beauty.

55:48.840 --> 55:51.640
- I see the beast.
- Lieutenant?

55:51.720 --> 55:53.880
Yeah, there's no one in the limo, sir.

55:53.960 --> 55:55.960
(both) What?

55:56.040 --> 56:00.240
All right, I'll talkto you later.
But don't try finding this girl on your own.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.880
Trust me on this one. This broad is lethal.

56:02.960 --> 56:05.000
Yeah. Whatever you say, boss.

56:05.080 --> 56:08.720
You can get cream to try to kill
whatever that is down there.

56:09.920 --> 56:13.960
Keeping Zuzu away from the disco duck
wasn't too fuckin'hard.

56:14.040 --> 56:16.280
But I'd have to wait to interrogate her.

56:18.720 --> 56:22.360
Colleen's on a revenge trip
against her ex-husband.

56:22.440 --> 56:26.600
Julian Grendel told me
his company's been gettin' ripped off.

56:26.680 --> 56:28.680
Makes total sense.

56:28.760 --> 56:34.280
Bobby and his friend, Colleen's lover Johnny
Crunch, find out about her little scheme.

56:34.360 --> 56:36.640
She has 'em killed.

56:36.720 --> 56:39.440
If that's so, who the hell are you?

56:41.240 --> 56:43.240
Zuzu Petals.

56:44.640 --> 56:46.640
Don't talkto me any more.

56:49.240 --> 56:51.400
Yum, yum. Tee-wee!

56:52.480 --> 56:56.080
Talking to Zuzu was like
masturbating with a cheese grater.

56:56.160 --> 56:59.400
Slightly amusing, but mostly painful.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.760
Zuzu!

57:15.720 --> 57:17.720
Zuzu?

57:18.480 --> 57:22.240
Zuzu. Zuzu. What happened?
Come on, honey.

57:22.960 --> 57:24.960
I'm so sorry about everything I said.

57:25.040 --> 57:28.160
Come on, just be all right.
Talkto me, honey. Come on.

57:28.240 --> 57:31.160
- That's it. Keep chewing.
- Huh...

57:31.320 --> 57:33.800
- That's it.
- Fluck!

57:33.880 --> 57:36.120
Great video, huh?

57:36.880 --> 57:40.440
- Are you OK?
- OK? I just blew up.

57:40.520 --> 57:43.280
I feel orgasmic.

57:44.760 --> 57:46.520
My guitar.

57:46.920 --> 57:48.920
My axe.

57:50.320 --> 57:52.360
My axe!

57:57.320 --> 57:59.560
Colleen fuckin' Sutton.

57:59.640 --> 58:01.640
I knew it!

58:01.720 --> 58:04.840
Ford? You got something
cooking in the microwave?

58:07.600 --> 58:09.600
Get out!

58:10.880 --> 58:13.480
- Get out.
- Oh, wait, wait. My purse.

58:13.560 --> 58:16.560
"Wait, my purse"? Get outta here. Come on!

58:36.160 --> 58:38.160
Jump, nitwit!

58:44.440 --> 58:46.440
Well, maybe it was just a potpie.

59:03.200 --> 59:04.960
I guess not.

59:05.040 --> 59:07.560
I tried to stop 'em, man. I'm sorry.

59:07.640 --> 59:09.680
Hey. Hey.

59:09.760 --> 59:12.160
Hey. Who did this to you?

59:12.240 --> 59:16.600
These two guys in real long cowboy coats
and real nice suits. I thinkArmani.

59:16.680 --> 59:19.880
They went through your stuff.
I did whatyou would've done.

59:19.960 --> 59:24.360
- Yeah. Run to a phone and call the cops.
- Fuckthat. I mean, to heck with that.

59:24.640 --> 59:27.600
I kicked their ass.
I tried. There were two of'em.

59:27.680 --> 59:29.960
All right. Let's go to the hospital.

59:30.040 --> 59:32.800
- I tried to help you.
- Hey, I appreciate it.

59:32.880 --> 59:35.920
Hey, where's my dad?
Have you even looked for him yet?

59:36.000 --> 59:39.440
- I've got some leads.
- You're a liar, man. You don't care.

59:39.960 --> 59:42.480
You don't care about nothing.

59:43.800 --> 59:47.000
- Where you goin'?
- Oh. He seems nice.

59:47.400 --> 59:50.080
Shut up. Just...just shut up.

59:57.200 --> 59:59.200
Ford? Bad news.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.080
I chipped a nail.

01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:05.280
Hey, the boys in the garage
brought my baby back.

01:00:07.320 --> 01:00:09.480
Oh, my God!

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:11.560
(horn blares)

01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:18.920
Why the music industry?

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:22.920
Why not Ford Fairlane,
the fisherman's detective, huh?

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.360
Wouldn't that be great?
Howtough could it be?

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:29.120
"Ford, somebody switched
the lures in my fuckin' tackle box."

01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:32.400
"Hey, Ford. Somebody sabotaged my bait."

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:36.640
- OK. Here comes...
- All right.

01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:39.360
All right.

01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:42.200
- Hey. You need a lift?
- (both) Yeah.

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.360
- (both) Fuck you!
- Motherfucker.

01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:51.320
Hi, private-eye guy!
Remember me, Melodi?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:01:02.440
Oh, wow. Hiding out from cold-blooded
killers. The sisters are going to die.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.600
("Cradle of Love" by Billy Idol)

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:16.400
So, this is my sorority.
I think you'll really like the girls.

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:22.720
Well, rock the cradle of love

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:26.080
Rock the cradle of love

01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:28.760
Yes, the cradle of love

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.080
Don't rock easily, it's true

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.840
Yeah

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:36.360
It burned like a ball of fire

01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:41.840
When the rebel took
a little child bride to tease, yeah

01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.920
So go easy, yeah

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:46.320
Oh

01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:49.280
Cos love cuts a million ways

01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:52.320
Shakes the devil when he misbehaves

01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.640
I ain't nobody's fool

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:58.720
Come on, shake it up, whatever I do

01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:01.200
Rock the cradle of love...

01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:05.160
Hey, troops. Here's
the rock 'n' roll detective I told you about.

01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.240
(music stops)

01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.080
Oh!

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:13.440
- Hi.
- Hey... Hey...

01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:17.200
Maybe I did die in the explosion, you know?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.280
(phone rings)

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:22.720
- Ford Fairlane.
- (Ford) Hey, Jazz.

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.960
Ford?

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:27.280
You would not believe
what I went through today.

01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:32.120
Colleen's thugs tried to kill me. You believe
that? They left her hat as a goodbye kiss.

01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:37.000
You know? I'm callin' from
the Ai Eta Pi sorority house, huh? Mm.

01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.760
Mm. They blew up my house, my car...

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:43.720
And let me tell you something. My
koala bear's not in such great shape either.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.000
- That's too bad.
- "That's too bad."

01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:48.800
"That's too bad" she tells me.
That's all you can say?

01:02:48.880 --> 01:02:53.560
Yes, Ford. That's about all I can say.

01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:57.400
Well, look. Stop playing games
over there and come here. I gotta see you.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.040
(dialling tone)

01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:05.200
So anyway, Springsteen says to Madonna
"Who could fuck in this weather?" Oh!

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.920
- Does Van Halen sleep in the nude?
- Does Debbie Gibson sleep with Van Halen?

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.560
- Rub my neck, huh?
- Is Sting really an asshole?

01:03:11.640 --> 01:03:15.960
If Axl Rose was reincarnated as a black
woman, would it be Jody Watley or Aretha?

01:03:16.040 --> 01:03:20.360
Sisters! Sisters, would you chill out?
Give Ford a break.

01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:24.040
What do you say we induct him
as an honorary member?

01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:26.160
(all) Yeah!

01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:32.440
If either one of you ever has a son,
I hope his dog dies.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.440
You really shouldn't have said that.

01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.520
Yeah. It's a tough business.

01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:45.440
- Bye-bye.
- See ya. One...

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.960
Two...

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.040
Three!

01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:54.520
Whoo-hoo!

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.680
(all chant) Qantas, jujubes,
salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:04.720
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:09.320
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:14.400
- Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.
- One, two...

01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.640
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.640
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:29.120
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:33.400
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:38.040
Quantas, jujubes, salcido, Ford Fairlane.

01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.960
- Everybody blow.
- Quantas, ju...

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.000
Where are you going?

01:04:46.720 --> 01:04:48.520
Move!

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:15.280
- Hey!
- Come on!

01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.320
- Oh!
- Oh, jeez!

01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:22.160
Come on. It's cut-our-losses time, man.

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:33.720
Oh, man, look at that! Goddamn!

01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.400
Dudes. They executed my Vette.

01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:51.680
Need a... lift?

01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.840
(moans in pain)

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:56.240
Jazz!

01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:02.760
- What happened?
- Why do you have to have...

01:06:02.840 --> 01:06:05.120
..an office on the second floor?

01:06:06.560 --> 01:06:10.440
- I came to warn you.
- I'll fuckin' kill them. Are you OK, huh?

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.200
- Yes.
- You all right?

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:16.200
They tried to get this worthless CD,
but I had it hidden in a special place.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:18.560
Once again, I came through.

01:06:18.640 --> 01:06:21.000
Damn red-numbered bullshit CD.

01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:25.000
Look, I have one. Bobby gave it to me
the night that he passed away.

01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.480
It's good. It's really avant-garde.
You can dance to it.

01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:34.640
Does yours go, like,
bzzz, eeek, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz, bzzz...?

01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:37.440
- Zuzu?
- Yeah, right. Birdbrain? Shut up, please.

01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:40.200
- Melodi, take Jazz to the hospital, OK?
- OK, sure.

01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:43.360
Wait a second. I want to see
if this is better than the last one.

01:06:43.440 --> 01:06:47.680
I don't need no CD to tell me Colleen Sutton's
behind this whole thing, all right?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.200
- Let's go.
- Come on.

01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:54.120
I'll be at Julie Grendel's to see if he knows
what a whore thief his ex-piece-of-shit wife is.

01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:57.360
Come on, move.
Come on, would you, please? Stupid!

01:06:57.440 --> 01:06:59.600
Why have you come to my planet, huh?

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.720
You're pure scum.

01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:04.000
(sniggers)

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:06.320
Colleen, you're a drag.

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.080
Julie, baby! What's goin' on, huh?

01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:18.040
Queen Colleen. You're here just in time to see
me do what I refer to as solving the case.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.240
It's cute. I think you'll like it.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:23.640
Colleen's been ripping off
her ex-husband here's company.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.280
And she's been murdering
to keep it a secret.

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.960
That's a pretty nifty theory.

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.240
Colleen!

01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.960
Colleen.

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.600
- Nice dress.
- Wait. My purse.

01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:42.240
- Ar... Ar...
- Aardvarks?

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:45.480
Julian's smuggling aardvarks
into the country?

01:07:46.360 --> 01:07:48.520
- Art...
- Artichokes?

01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.360
Art... Mooney... stupid!

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:56.840
- Thanks. I needed that.
- (Zuzu gasps)

01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:02.720
You sick, confusing motherfuckers.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:06.440
Gimme the three discs, Ford.

01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:09.400
Bobby's, Colleen's and Johnny's.

01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:11.560
Three CDs?

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.760
Shit. Just start torturin' me, man.

01:08:14.840 --> 01:08:17.160
I didn't even know Johnny had a disc.

01:08:17.240 --> 01:08:23.120
I'm not in the mood for any of that "Don't play
games with me, Mr Fairlane" bullshit.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:25.960
Don't play games with me, Mr...

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:28.120
Did you say you don't have the...?

01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.600
Torture you?

01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:35.439
I'm not gonna torture you, Ford.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.640
Not her, Ford, butyour best friend.

01:08:38.720 --> 01:08:43.880
A 1962 Fender Stratocaster
with original pick-ups and maple neck...

01:08:43.960 --> 01:08:48.160
..and strung upside down
for a left-handed genius - Jimi Hendrix.

01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:51.760
- That's something else entirely.
- No!

01:08:52.399 --> 01:08:53.399
Argh!

01:08:53.479 --> 01:08:56.640
That's the same sound
your koala bear made when we hung it.

01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:00.520
Don'tyou thinkthis guitar would look
better with Ford's name carved in it?

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.960
- Come on!
- (henchmen) Oh, yeah!

01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:05.040
(Ford grunts)

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.880
Rape!

01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:10.920
(Ford) Come on! OK. OK.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:15.120
OK. OK.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:20.040
Boy, you guys are tough. OK, you got me.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.680
All right, I gotyour discs, asshole.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:29.800
They're in a very safe place, with instructions
that they be sent directly to the police...

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:33.120
..if I don't make a call by seven o'clock.

01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.640
So, if you'll excuse us...

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.200
Well, it's 7.30, Ford.
You really should get a watch.

01:09:40.920 --> 01:09:43.359
Ford, Ford, Ford.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:46.399
How about a last drink?
I'm running a little late.

01:09:47.319 --> 01:09:51.840
We're giving a party tonight at the club
to introduce Kyle Troy to the world.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:56.160
Everyone in the industry's gonna be there,
including our friend Don Cleveland.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.440
- Yeah? What about Don?
- Before Kyle Troy does his first set,...

01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:01.880
..Don will have his head blown off.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:04.000
Next week, the newspapers will reveal...

01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:09.560
..that Don was partners with Bobby, Collie
and Johnny in the Grendel Records scam.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:14.720
And he killed 'em to pay off some debt
to the Mob or something lame like that.

01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.240
And then he got iced.
It's a lot more tasteful than it sounds.

01:10:19.320 --> 01:10:25.600
You know, I cannot believe
thatyou guys actually hung a koala bear.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:29.920
That is just so graphic.
You know, I am still in shock here.

01:10:30.160 --> 01:10:33.120
- Is she for real?
- I'm afraid so. You want her?

01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:36.840
- ..but that was just a dream. I don't think...
- (all) Shut up!

01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:38.960
(sighs)

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:41.160
You know, Julie, you're the goods.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:46.560
And even though I might be perturbed you're
gonna kill me, I gotta salute your toughness.

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:50.520
Julian Grendel,
guys like you do grow on trees.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:54.600
Here's to you, buddy... suckin' my dick.

01:10:57.120 --> 01:10:59.320
Take a free shot, boss.

01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:02.480
Sure.

01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:11.800
(Grendel) Moron.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.880
Zuzu.

01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:17.760
- Zuzu, are you OK?
- Oh. Another trick question, right?

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.840
Open the window.

01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:28.080
Shit.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:31.800
- Hello?
- When I say "now", you run for the door, OK?

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.880
Eugh. What...

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.840
Kill him.

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:47.080
But not quickly. Ciao, Ford.

01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:53.880
Anybody else in this situation
would shit a Miata.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:56.080
- Ow. Come on...
- But I had a plan.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.400
Not the greatest plan, but hey.

01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:02.040
The old "gum on the earring
in the socket" trick never failed me.

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.120
I'd never even tried it.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920
- Now!
- Argh!

01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:12.600
Argh!

01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:19.520
- Out this way.
- No. This way.

01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:21.720
I'd blown the case wide open.

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.040
It's too bad that my clients were dead and
that I had no actual proof against Grendel.

01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:31.320
And now I'm on top
of the Capitol Records building?

01:12:31.400 --> 01:12:34.160
So much for
climbin' down the fire escape shit.

01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:38.840
Johnny and Colleen were lucky to be dead,
barkin'in that big chuck wagon in the sky.

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.520
At least they knew who the fuck
ArtMooney was. I'm losin'my mind! Argh!

01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:46.280
- Top of the world, Ma!
- (both) Mm!

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:50.880
- I left my purse. I...
- Fuckthe purse. We're gonna die!

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.320
And you say I never take you anywhere.

01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:01.960
Ah, shit.

01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.080
There is something so wrong with you.
Come on.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.880
Come on. Here, here. Come on, you can do it.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:18.240
You all right? Come on.
It's all right. If you fall, I'll make it.

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.200
(Zuzu) OK.

01:13:24.320 --> 01:13:27.440
- Move, stupid.
- I made it. OK?

01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.480
Um... Uh... Here.

01:13:50.920 --> 01:13:53.200
- (gunshot)
- Ah! Oops.

01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.840
The building is a symbol
of the music industry,...

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.480
..a business where
anything can happen.

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:05.000
And usually does.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.120
Oops.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.640
- Bull's-eye.
- Oh, ick.

01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:12.560
- Ick.
- What did you throwthe gun away for?

01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640
- It just, oh... Yuck.
- Come on.

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:25.400
- Hello, hello.
- Oh! Hold me!

01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.880
- Ford, help!
- (Smiley laughs maniacally)

01:14:29.960 --> 01:14:32.360
Ah! Ah!

01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.360
Hello, hello, fuckface.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:59.000
- Yabba-dabba-doo!
- (Zuzu) What?

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:00.920
- (Ford) The ring!
- (Zuzu) What ring?

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.880
It's the kid's father. I can't.

01:15:02.960 --> 01:15:06.520
Who do you think you are, Ford?
The tooth fairy? Kill! Kill! Kill!

01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.640
- It's a long story. You knowthe kid?
- What kid? Oh, the kid.

01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:11.320
- The Flintstone ring?
- The nice one?

01:15:11.400 --> 01:15:14.520
Yeah, the nice kid I hang with.

01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.600
My hair. My hair.

01:15:38.960 --> 01:15:40.960
- Hey, Zuzu.
- Huh?

01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:44.040
- Don't worry. I'll work it out.
- OK.

01:15:45.440 --> 01:15:48.400
Excuse me while I kiss the sky!

01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:53.560
Hey, Zuzu, I found my guitar!
I found my guitar!

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:57.960
It's all scratched up.

01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:00.400
(tearful) It's all scratched up, Zuzu.

01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.800
- Ford? I'll take her with me!
- Get off of me!

01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.040
- I swear I will.
- Oh, Ford!

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.720
You're tearin' me apart!

01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:12.320
I'm sorry, Jimi.

01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:25.480
What the fuck...?

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:28.640
Say hello to Liberace, asshole.

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.080
Come on. Come on. Come on, you can do it.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:34.160
Come on. Come on.

01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:38.520
Thank you.

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:45.280
Thanks. Because, I mean,
I know how much that thang meant to you.

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:54.320
Well, hello, Mr Tongue. What a perv!

01:16:55.520 --> 01:16:57.240
Yeah. You wish.

01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.480
- (Ford) Don't look down.
- OK.

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:14.640
'Scuse me. Could you tell us howto
get to Mann's Chinese Theatre?

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.240
- Go backto Michigan, asswipe.
- No, we're from Wisconsin.

01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.560
Yeah, and I'm from my dad's penis.
Get outta here.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:23.640
(horn beeps)

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.800
How'd it go?
Did you get more proof against Colleen?

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:32.280
Colleen's innocent. And dead.

01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:35.680
Well, I figured something out.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.760
These binary discs?

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:43.800
They've got hidden bits that can be revealed
when interfacing with a third CD.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:49.280
Oh, Ford! Look how cute.
Your friend's got his own star.

01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.200
What friend?

01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:55.560
You know, thatArt guy.

01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.880
(Ford) Art. Art Mooney!

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.800
Art. Art, baby!

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:05.880
Art!

01:18:08.640 --> 01:18:11.360
Art, baby. Third CD, anyone, huh?

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:14.960
I don't need no funky attitude

01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:23.880
You spend so much time trying to be rude

01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:26.800
Why the funky attitude?

01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.720
Oh, no, I don't care how you're feelin'

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.800
I don't need no funky attitude...

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.520
Hey.

01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.680
Julie! You sure know how it's done.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.360
Thank you, Don. Uh, could I
talkto you in private a moment?

01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:04.440
B-i-n-g-o. And Bingo was his name-o.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:09.960
'Scuse me, but all I see is a condom factory
in Johannesburg, South Africa. Now what...

01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:12.880
I believe the word
you're lookin' for is "proof'.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:16.200
It's a front for a pirate disc operation.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:19.960
Grendel's secretly counterfeiting
his own company's stock.

01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.360
We're dealin' with a very sick puppy here.

01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:28.680
Oh, my God. The door's locked.
We're gonna have to crawl down.

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.760
No. I knew it. I knew it.

01:19:34.160 --> 01:19:36.280
Psych!

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.520
Moron.

01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:44.680
What can I say, Don? You're a great producer.
You're a great friend.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:48.000
I'm gonna miss you.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:51.600
What can I tell you? It's business.

01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:54.240
With friends like you, who needs enemas?

01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:58.640
Dump the body in, shall we say, Chinatown.

01:20:17.240 --> 01:20:19.240
(Ford) Hey, Don.

01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:23.840
- How's the high blood pressure?
- Wait until the last minute, Ford!

01:20:23.920 --> 01:20:27.360
Can somebody tell me
what the fuck is going on, like, slowly?

01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:32.960
You see... it all started...
with this condom factory...

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:35.320
I'll write you a letter. Come on.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:41.520
All right. You threw me
through a plate-glass window.

01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:45.080
I hityou with my car.
I thinkthat made for a fair fight.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:47.840
Maybe not.

01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.920
(cheering)

01:20:50.200 --> 01:20:53.920
The truth is,
there's a lot of love in this room tonight.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:05.880
But I... I've...

01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:08.480
- I've talked long enough.
- Oh, no!

01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:14.080
Nowthe momentyou've all been waiting for.
I'd like you to meet the voice of the '90s.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:16.920
Ladies and gentlemen, Kyle Troy.

01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000
(cheering)

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.320
(henchman coughs)

01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:00.520
Ow. Shit, man.

01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.760
I used to be just like you.

01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:07.760
Abusing women
to hide my emotional insecurities.

01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:15.640
You're seconds away from
the most embarrassing moment of your life.

01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:17.920
Sam the Sleazebag to the rescue.

01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:25.680
You said something about three CDs?

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:31.640
Uh, Ford... I'll do...
I'll do anything, man. I mean, we don't...

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:39.720
And may I suggest for dessert...
the copies I made?

01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:42.000
- Fuck me.
- Yeah, maybe later.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:46.160
But first, why don'tyou tell me why
you're rippin' your own company off?

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:48.240
I read Billboard.

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:53.480
I couldn't believe how much Grendel Records
made and how little Julie Grendel got.

01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.400
It's amazing how much you gotta pay
the actual artists who create the music, huh?

01:22:58.480 --> 01:23:01.160
Those ingrate bastards really take a bite.

01:23:01.440 --> 01:23:05.760
Look, Bobby Black found out about
your little African bogus disc company.

01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:09.840
Stole your computer records.
Wanna tell me about it?

01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:14.240
Bobby was stupid. He got angry.
His friend Johnny was more stupid.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.840
He got greedy. Tried to blackmail me.

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.840
Me! Colleen knew better.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.960
She knew what a monster I could be.

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:27.640
Poor Colleen just wanted no one to get hurt.
That's why I waited so long to kill her.

01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.720
Face it. Making money is
the only art form left open to innovation.

01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:36.480
Anybody says they're in this industry
cos they like music is a lying,...

01:23:36.560 --> 01:23:38.880
..pathetic piece of shit!

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.080
(outraged murmuring)

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:45.400
Or a total idiot like this Kyle Toy,
or Troy, or whatever the hell his name is.

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:49.360
I've dedicated my life to making sure
that this industry is so disgusting,...

01:23:49.440 --> 01:23:53.240
..so sleazy and so corrupt
it would have to self-destruct.

01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:55.400
Two sambuca milkshakes.

01:23:55.480 --> 01:23:57.920
I even pissed in the punchbowl!

01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:02.560
You're a hell of a guy. You knowthat, Julie?

01:24:02.640 --> 01:24:06.480
Since you're on a roll,
anything else you wanna talk about?

01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:09.280
Why? You hiding a mike or something?

01:24:09.520 --> 01:24:11.680
No. I am.

01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.760
You little bitch.

01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:16.280
Why do birds... Hey!

01:24:16.360 --> 01:24:18.440
Suddenly appear?

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:22.760
On the day thatyou were born,
the angels got together

01:24:22.840 --> 01:24:24.840
And decided to create a...

01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:36.920
Well, Mr Rock 'n' Roll Detective.

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.640
- You're out of the business.
- Ford!

01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:42.800
Shake me, Jazz.

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.480
"In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida", baby.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.520
You're fired, Julie.

01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:14.920
Ford.

01:25:16.960 --> 01:25:19.800
Look. Look who I found. It's Damion Flemm.

01:25:19.880 --> 01:25:22.320
He loves me, and he's taking me to Japan.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:26.960
It's Disco Appreciation Night
at the Coconut Teazer. The one night...

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.720
Sorry, sir, but we got a report
that the psycho-killer groupie was here.

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:33.440
- Take good care of her.
- That shouldn't be too hard.

01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:36.160
- Yeah, sure.
- There she is with Fairlane.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:40.920
Harbouring a fugitive, Ford?

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000
You're goin' down.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.440
Sexual favours won't help, baby.

01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:48.600
Cos it's booty time. Booty...

01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:52.360
(falsetto) Booty time, booty time...

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:54.840
Happy viewing.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.640
Jerk-off.

01:25:59.080 --> 01:26:01.480
- What'd you say?
- I didn't say nothin', man.

01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:04.680
Shit, man! You're the lead singer
of Disco Express.

01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:08.520
"Booty Time" is the only white disco
song as far as I'm concerned.

01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.560
- There's more where that came from, man.
- I'm listenin'.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:15.120
(both)Booty time,
booty time across the USA

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:18.480
Booty time, booty time, yeah, yeah, yeah

01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:21.160
- Isn't Sam great?
- Do you wanna come out with us?

01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.400
I can't. Anybody see my assistant, Jazz?

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:28.240
She left. She said something
aboutyou being a real asshole.

01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:31.800
Right, right.

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.880
That sounds right.

01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:36.440
("The Wind Cries Mary" by Richie Sambora)

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:42.120
Jazz is gone and I got the blues.

01:26:43.160 --> 01:26:47.040
A lot of fuckin' things are gone
and I got the blues.

01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:51.400
I'll tell you, bein'an ultra-cool
rock 'n'roll superhero...

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:54.200
It sounded a lot better
in the brochure.

01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:00.560
I can't believe it took a bunch of phoney CDs
to make me lose all my self-worth and shit.

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:05.600
I was just gonna take a nice long... nap.

01:27:05.680 --> 01:27:07.880
Hello, hello.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.560
I don't believe this.

01:27:15.400 --> 01:27:20.400
Why did I pause before I pushed you, huh?
You know, if you weren't that kid's father...

01:27:20.760 --> 01:27:23.720
- What are you talking about?
- The ring, man.

01:27:23.800 --> 01:27:26.880
What about it? I stole it.

01:27:26.960 --> 01:27:28.720
(giggles)

01:27:28.800 --> 01:27:34.160
From some idiot in Fresno
that I strangled lastyear.

01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.920
Perfect end
to a perfect evening, huh?

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.520
Un-fuckin'-believable.

01:27:42.480 --> 01:27:49.560
I mean, I start by having my koala bear hung,
and my house and car blown up.

01:27:49.640 --> 01:27:53.000
That was just the beginning of the evening.
Just getting started.

01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:58.040
Then I get to climb down the Capitol Records
building. Great exercise. I recommend it.

01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:02.000
Then my guitar, my axe -
the one thing I love, next to Stanley -

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:04.600
..is nowtoothpicks for
the Hollywood homeless.

01:28:04.680 --> 01:28:08.320
And then after I torch your boss,
my girlfriend leaves me.

01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.000
She leaves me, hey? Terrific.

01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:16.760
And now... now I get to die.

01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:19.040
You're breakin' me heart.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.440
What's the point?

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.000
The point is I wanna
go out man-to-man. Just me and you.

01:28:26.080 --> 01:28:29.600
Put down the gun, let's go at it.
Come on, you fuckin' sissy.

01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.160
Are you afraid of me?
Come on, mano-to-mano.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:35.680
Fisticuffs, baby. Let's go at it,
justyou and me. No one's around.

01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.880
Come on, I've fuckin' had it. Let's go!

01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:48.560
(drops gun)

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:53.360
All right. Any way you want it.

01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:02.080
You crack me up, you knowthat?

01:29:02.160 --> 01:29:04.960
What kind of idiot throws his gun down?
Use your head.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:07.080
Is there somethin' wrong with you or what?

01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:09.400
I mean... Look. Look whatyou did.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:20.040
Thanks for workin'.

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.640
Thanks for bein' a jerk-off.
I mean, "man-to-man", "mano-to-mano".

01:29:24.720 --> 01:29:29.000
What the hell does "mano-to-mano" mean?
Use your head.

01:29:29.880 --> 01:29:31.880
Snapper-head.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.920
So here I am.

01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:43.240
The bad guys are dead,
my life's ruined, and the case is closed.

01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.680
Hey, what else can I say?
At least things can't get any more depressing.

01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:50.520
So... did you find my dad?

01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.400
Un-fuckin'-believable.

01:29:55.080 --> 01:29:58.200
I got some good news...
and I got some bad news.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:03.000
The good news is, I found him.
The bad news...

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:06.960
It's me.

01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:13.120
What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?

01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:16.880
Hey, a guy tries to make a commitment,
I gotta eat shit?

01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.240
Well, just tell me who my real father is.

01:30:22.640 --> 01:30:26.400
He died. No bullshit.

01:30:26.480 --> 01:30:29.360
But he loved you a lot
and he wants me to take care of you.

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.160
Come on, put it there.

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:35.240
That's it.

01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:41.600
I mean, I got a heavy caseload,
you know what I mean?

01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:53.080
Ford. Ford!

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.800
Come on.

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:06.160
Ford, I can't take this crap
between us any more. I'm sorry.

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.320
- I'm quitting.
- Dismount.

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:14.680
I love you.

01:31:16.320 --> 01:31:20.640
- What kind of sentimental bullshit is this?
- That's exactly whatl said.

01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.920
Jazz, look.

01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:27.040
I'm sick of the hot clubs,
the hot cars, the hot chicks.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.120
I'm sick of it. All the fun...

01:31:30.360 --> 01:31:32.920
I wantyou.

01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:35.280
You're saying I'm not fun?

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:38.800
You told me to say this stuff.

01:31:40.440 --> 01:31:44.760
Look. I'm crazy aboutyou, all right?
You... you know what I'm sayin'.

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.960
No. I really don't know whatyou're saying.

01:31:52.040 --> 01:31:54.360
But I like the tone of your voice.

01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.920
I really like the tone of your voice.
