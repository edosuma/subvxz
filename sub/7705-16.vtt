WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:07.473
If anybody wants me,
I'll be in the whirling hot tub.

00:07.475 --> 00:09.274
We don't have
a whirling hot tub.

00:09.276 --> 00:11.577
I know.
I'm going to improvise.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.483
- Any mail for me?
- No, sorry.

00:17.485 --> 00:20.586
- How about me?
- All of it.

00:23.624 --> 00:27.292
But, ALF, I-I don't want you
joining any more record clubs.

00:27.294 --> 00:28.794
Fine, fine.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.162
Oh, hey, before I forget

00:30.164 --> 00:32.631
I'll need you to write out
a couple of checks.

00:32.633 --> 00:35.601
One to Greenpeace,
the other to the Auto Club.

00:37.004 --> 00:39.171
You're a member
of the Auto Club?

00:39.173 --> 00:41.974
I like the magazine.

00:41.976 --> 00:43.742
I'm not writing
any more checks.

00:43.744 --> 00:46.245
Well, fine,
my checks just came.

00:47.415 --> 00:50.182
Oh, darn.
I ordered sunrise.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.884
They sent me sunset.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.356
- Go take your bath.
- Fine.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.925
I wish these insurance companies
would leave me alone.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.661
I'm already fully covered
through the Auto Club.

01:04.732 --> 01:06.765
I just know he's gonna
get hair in the drain.

01:07.535 --> 01:09.334
He was wearing a shower cap.

01:13.240 --> 01:17.042
Why was he carrying my mixer
into the bathroom?

01:17.044 --> 01:19.745
He said something
about a whirling hot tub.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.947
(ALF)
'Whoa!'

01:21.949 --> 01:24.817
- ALF!
- Oh, my gosh!

01:25.853 --> 01:28.120
ALF? Are you alright?

01:30.591 --> 01:31.957
ALF?

01:32.960 --> 01:35.127
There must be some mistake.

01:35.129 --> 01:38.697
I'm Wayne Schlegel,
Michigan Life And Casualty.

01:42.303 --> 01:45.137
[theme music]

02:09.263 --> 02:11.230
[music continues]

02:47.835 --> 02:49.968
Wayne Schlegel?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.770
Michigan Life And Casualty.

02:51.772 --> 02:54.473
Heh, heh, heh.

02:54.475 --> 02:55.807
Pleased to meet you.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.376
What is he talking about?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.278
I'm talking about your future.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.780
I'm talking about
an insurance plan

03:01.782 --> 03:04.816
that will fit your needs.

03:04.818 --> 03:07.452
I-I think he's trying
to sell us insurance.

03:09.023 --> 03:12.691
Maybe the bump on his head
did something to his memory.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.826
Well, he seems okay otherwise.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.795
He just thinks
he's Wayne Schlegel.

03:16.797 --> 03:19.064
Michigan Life And Casualty.

03:22.036 --> 03:23.802
Look, he must've been reading
this insurance stuff

03:23.804 --> 03:25.170
in the bathroom.

03:25.172 --> 03:27.839
Please take one
of our free calendars.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.741
Thank you.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.476
Oh, the metric tables.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.514
- Listen, ALF.
- Wayne.

03:35.516 --> 03:36.882
Wayne..

03:36.884 --> 03:39.418
...I th-I think that
you should sit down.

03:39.420 --> 03:42.821
Don't mind if I do.
What was your name again?

03:42.823 --> 03:44.256
Kate.

03:44.258 --> 03:46.191
And I'm Lynn..

03:46.193 --> 03:47.559
...Tanner!

03:47.561 --> 03:50.195
Right.
Kate and Lynn Tanner.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.198
Don't tell me.
You two are sisters, right?

03:53.200 --> 03:55.000
Heh, heh, heh.

03:55.002 --> 03:57.703
ALF, I want you to stop this.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.339
<i>You</i> are not an insurance agent.

04:00.341 --> 04:04.109
You're an alien
from the planet Melmac.

04:04.111 --> 04:06.945
Whatever you say.
The customer's always right.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.047
Now, if I can find
my actuarial table.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.618
ALF, she's serious.
Don't you remember?

04:12.620 --> 04:13.952
[electronic device beeping]

04:13.954 --> 04:17.389
Willie?
Wha-what's that?

04:17.391 --> 04:21.226
Oh, my gosh.
It can't be!

04:21.228 --> 04:23.895
The lights.
What happened to the lights?

04:23.897 --> 04:26.265
Daddy, daddy,
what's that thing in the sky?

04:26.267 --> 04:28.700
- What's going on?
- It's closing in fast.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.469
I think maybe we better..

04:30.471 --> 04:32.504
[crash]

04:43.651 --> 04:46.318
We...we have a visitor.

04:50.658 --> 04:52.057
Well?

04:52.059 --> 04:55.627
Well, offhand, I can think
of several policies

04:55.629 --> 04:57.496
that cover roof damage.

04:57.498 --> 05:00.932
But, of course, since
this is a pre-existing condition

05:00.934 --> 05:04.136
you couldn't claim it
under a new policy.

05:04.138 --> 05:06.004
We're not getting
through to him.

05:06.006 --> 05:07.673
What are we going to do?

05:07.675 --> 05:09.508
I don't know. Just..

05:09.510 --> 05:11.310
...don't sign anything.

05:12.446 --> 05:14.513
We're back.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.148
You must be Mr. Tanner.

05:16.150 --> 05:18.784
Good guess, umm, ALF.

05:18.786 --> 05:20.619
Wayne Schlegel.

05:20.621 --> 05:22.688
Michigan Life And Casualty.

05:22.690 --> 05:26.091
Huh? Wha..
What's going on here?

05:26.093 --> 05:29.828
- ALF is...an insurance agent.
- You got a job?

05:29.830 --> 05:32.931
No. Dad, ALF took a bad fall
on the hot tub.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.266
And we think he lost his memory.

05:34.268 --> 05:38.470
Oh, no.
But we don't have a hot tub.

05:38.472 --> 05:42.341
Well, that's good, Willie,
because we don't cover hot tubs.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.443
- It is Willie, isn't it?
- Yes.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.211
We don't cover hot tubs.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.781
We've been trying
to snap him out of it.

05:49.783 --> 05:52.117
Maybe we should call Dr. Jeff.

05:52.119 --> 05:55.787
No, no, Dr. Jeff doesn't handle
this kind of a thing.

05:55.789 --> 05:58.256
- Who does?
- Dr. Demento.

05:59.493 --> 06:00.726
- ALF..
- Wayne.

06:00.728 --> 06:02.060
- Wayne.
- Willie.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.731
ALF, you're not
an insurance agent.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.866
It's not that we have anything
against insurance agents

06:07.868 --> 06:10.302
but that-that's not
what you are.

06:10.304 --> 06:11.903
You're an alien.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.540
I can't believe it!

06:15.542 --> 06:16.875
What do you think it is?

06:16.877 --> 06:18.910
A real alien!

06:20.013 --> 06:21.813
(Kate)
'Willie.'

06:21.815 --> 06:24.249
'Willie, what is it?'

06:24.251 --> 06:26.685
Brian's right.
It's an ALF.

06:26.687 --> 06:28.687
- What?
- An ALF.

06:28.689 --> 06:32.524
An A-L-F. That's short
for alien life form.

06:32.526 --> 06:34.593
Can ALF stay in my room?

06:34.595 --> 06:37.863
No! No, this thing is not
staying in anyone's..

06:37.865 --> 06:39.197
It's not staying!

06:39.199 --> 06:42.033
Why not? ET got to stay.

06:42.035 --> 06:44.736
ET was a movie.
This is real.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.105
This is on our coffee table.

06:48.675 --> 06:51.877
Well, you people sure spin
some crazy yarns.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.178
Heh, heh, heh.

06:53.180 --> 06:55.947
Mind if I use your phone
to call the office?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.883
Office?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.519
I seem to have forgotten
my number.

07:00.521 --> 07:03.255
Well, it's right here
on your business card.

07:03.257 --> 07:04.589
Oh, eh.

07:04.591 --> 07:06.024
Willie, let him call.

07:06.026 --> 07:10.095
Maybe he'll realize
he isn't Wayne Schlegel.

07:10.097 --> 07:12.230
Hi, hon. Wayne.

07:12.232 --> 07:16.535
Yeah, I'm at 5-5-5-4-0-4-4.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.103
Any messages?

07:18.105 --> 07:20.439
Wayne, why do you
sound so funny?

07:22.242 --> 07:24.342
Is your wife with you?

07:24.812 --> 07:25.911
No.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.913
Good, then we can talk.

07:27.915 --> 07:31.583
Where were you today? I waited
at the motel for over an hour.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.785
Uh, I don't remember.

07:33.787 --> 07:36.988
Yeah, well, listen, buster, if
you think I'm gonna wait around

07:36.990 --> 07:38.623
for you forever,
you are out of your mind.

07:38.625 --> 07:42.294
'Either you ask for a divorce
tonight, or we are through!'

07:42.296 --> 07:46.331
Okay, okay! I'll ask her
for a divorce tonight.

07:48.569 --> 07:52.270
Boy, you have a couple of
drinks, a few laughs..

07:52.272 --> 07:54.639
...they think it's forever.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.241
This has gone far enough.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.009
You obviously
haven't met Brenda.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.945
Neither have you.

07:59.947 --> 08:02.514
Now, look,
you're not an insurance agent.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.282
You don't know anything
about insurance.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.985
A few months ago, you didn't
know anything about this planet.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.120
[rattling]

08:09.122 --> 08:13.625
It's the day before Christmas!
I've hidden all the eggs.

08:13.627 --> 08:17.128
Alf, we hide eggs at Easter,
not at Christmas.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.697
Oh, that's right.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.600
Christmas is when
we carve the pumpkin.

08:21.602 --> 08:24.302
Oh, well, there's plenty
to keep you occupied.

08:24.304 --> 08:27.739
We've got, uh, magazines.
This is a jigsaw puzzle.

08:32.613 --> 08:35.313
- It's broken!
- That's the object.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.716
You're supposed to
put it together.

08:37.718 --> 08:39.718
Why?
I didn't break it.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.153
Uh, ALF, how-how would you
like to go outside

08:42.155 --> 08:44.656
uh, throw around the ol'
Frisbee?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.658
- The old what?
- The old Frisbee.

08:46.660 --> 08:48.727
Yeah, here.
I'll-I'll show you how it goes.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.398
I guess I'm not in the mood.

08:53.400 --> 08:57.235
Alright, let me see if I've got
this reindeer thing straight.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.738
There's, uh, there's Dasher..

08:59.740 --> 09:01.172
...Dancer..

09:01.174 --> 09:03.975
...Comet, Cupid..

09:03.977 --> 09:05.777
...Matthew, Mark,
Luke and John.

09:06.914 --> 09:11.082
No, it's Prancer, Dancer..

09:11.084 --> 09:13.852
...Vixen, Blitzen..

09:13.854 --> 09:16.555
Huey, Dewey, and Louie.

09:16.557 --> 09:19.024
No, those are ducks.

09:19.026 --> 09:21.259
Then how do they pull the sled?

09:22.195 --> 09:24.829
Just keep your distance,
alright?

09:24.831 --> 09:26.565
And try to be considerate.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.700
No problem.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.368
That is not considerate!

09:30.370 --> 09:32.370
That is<i> the opposite</i>
of considerate!

09:32.372 --> 09:34.773
That is<i> inconsiderate!</i>

09:36.343 --> 09:40.545
So, now, isn't it obvious
you're not this Wayne Schlegel?

09:40.547 --> 09:42.380
The only thing that's obvious

09:42.382 --> 09:45.383
is that your minds
aren't on insurance.

09:45.385 --> 09:49.287
Listen, nobody likes to think
about the inevitable

09:49.289 --> 09:52.591
but you do have a responsibility
to your family.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.894
- He's right, dad.
- We don't need insurance.

09:55.896 --> 09:59.931
And I hope you never do.
Knock wood.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.566
But I'll leave some brochures.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.969
You can call me
when you're ready to talk.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.071
By the way, Willie,
are you parked behind me?

10:06.073 --> 10:08.873
- I don't think so.
- Good.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.710
Where did I put my coat?

10:11.712 --> 10:14.346
In fact,
where did I put my pants?

10:15.082 --> 10:18.249
Oh, my God! I'm naked!

10:18.251 --> 10:19.618
Well, not to us, you aren't.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.787
Okay, so you're free thinkers,
but I'm not!

10:22.789 --> 10:26.424
I want my keys, I want my pants,
and I wanna leave.

10:26.426 --> 10:29.594
- Don't let him go!
- Oh!

10:29.596 --> 10:32.764
- Out of my way, all of you!
- No!

10:32.766 --> 10:34.766
Oh, no.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.601
First, you strip me.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.903
Now, you're holding me prisoner.

10:38.905 --> 10:41.940
I've heard about this happening
to other insurance agents

10:41.942 --> 10:44.209
but I never thought
it would happen to me.

10:45.846 --> 10:47.846
[instrumental music]

10:51.752 --> 10:52.951
You can't keep me here!

10:52.953 --> 10:55.520
This is for your own good,
Wayne. I mean ALF!

10:55.522 --> 10:57.422
You're in big trouble, mister.

10:57.424 --> 10:59.090
You're going to go
to jail for this.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.458
You may never get out!

11:00.460 --> 11:04.262
And if you do,
just try getting insurance!

11:04.264 --> 11:07.532
Please, please, ALF.
Just, just try to calm down.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.834
And maybe, maybe things
will start coming back to you.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.605
I don't want to calm down.
I'm a high-energy salesman.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.840
How do you think I made
the Million Dollar Club?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.642
Look around you, ALF

11:17.644 --> 11:19.878
doesn't any of this
seem familiar to you?

11:21.148 --> 11:23.481
Is that what this is all about?

11:23.483 --> 11:25.717
Did I have an affair
with your wife too?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.554
[alarm ringing]

11:31.858 --> 11:33.692
- Morning.
- Morning.

11:34.661 --> 11:36.127
Hey, I'm sorry.

11:36.129 --> 11:38.730
One thing just led to another,
Willie.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.131
No, no, no.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.566
I think we can be
reasonably sure

11:41.568 --> 11:43.168
that that did not happen.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.970
In fact, at first,
the two of you

11:45.972 --> 11:48.173
didn't even really..

11:48.175 --> 11:50.742
She detested you.

11:50.744 --> 11:52.877
[both screaming]

11:52.879 --> 11:55.580
- Willie!
- Willie!

11:58.819 --> 12:01.152
- What's going on over there?
- Nothin'.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.655
Just screaming.

12:03.657 --> 12:05.890
- Move out of the way.
- No problem.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.529
Let me put it this way, Willie.

12:11.531 --> 12:13.498
I don't think
this is going to work out.

12:13.500 --> 12:17.102
I'll take care of it.
Everything's fine.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.937
Everything's under control.

12:22.109 --> 12:23.775
[toilet flushing]

12:26.213 --> 12:27.846
Interesting concept.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.615
So we straightened that out.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.884
I didn't have an affair
with your wife.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.054
Now, if you'll just
give me my pants.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.622
I can't let you leave.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.892
Look, if the plan
is to hold me for ransom

12:40.894 --> 12:42.527
you could forget about it.

12:42.529 --> 12:46.798
My company has a policy of not
negotiating with terrorists.

12:46.800 --> 12:49.467
We do, however,
have some other policies

12:49.469 --> 12:51.369
you might be interested in,
Willie.

12:51.371 --> 12:54.439
In fact, I could set you up
with a whole life..

12:54.441 --> 12:56.241
- How old are you?
- I'm 45.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.577
Hmm, 45.
We better act fast.

12:59.579 --> 13:02.480
I could set you up
with a whole life policy

13:02.482 --> 13:05.550
that will benefit you and
your family for years to come.

13:05.552 --> 13:07.752
Just think about this, Willie.

13:07.754 --> 13:08.720
[humming]

13:08.722 --> 13:11.222
Oh, eh, hello, Dr. Schnegmeier.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.925
Uh, yeah.
Uh, listen, uh, doctor..

13:13.927 --> 13:17.428
...it seems that a, a houseguest
of ours has, uh..

13:17.430 --> 13:19.430
...come down with amnesia.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.065
No. We can't bring him in.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.567
Uh, listen, isn't there
some kind of, you know

13:22.569 --> 13:24.435
home remedy we can try?

13:24.437 --> 13:27.906
Breathing into a paper bag
or.. What?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.440
What does he say to do?

13:29.442 --> 13:31.342
Hit him on the head
with a rolling pin.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.580
No, I don't think that's funny.

13:35.582 --> 13:38.449
No, I don't watch
"The Three Stooges."

13:38.451 --> 13:40.018
You're right, I should.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.321
Uh, listen, doctor, I-I think
we'll try the hospital.

13:43.323 --> 13:45.990
Yes, I-I'm sure
he has insurance.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.592
Bye-bye.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.761
Should I get the rolling pin?

13:49.763 --> 13:53.965
No. We can't hit him on the head
with a rolling pin.

13:53.967 --> 13:55.533
At least we shouldn't.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.969
We certainly can't take him
to the hospital.

13:57.971 --> 14:00.271
So we're stuck having
an insurance agent

14:00.273 --> 14:01.639
living in our laundry room.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.608
Why does ALF keep doing
things like this?

14:03.610 --> 14:05.310
Oh, mom, it's not like
this is his fault.

14:05.312 --> 14:06.811
He's like a three-year-old.

14:06.813 --> 14:09.647
You have to keep your eye
on him constantly.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.550
<i> ["Old Time Rock 'N' Roll"</i>

14:14.688 --> 14:18.556

off the shelf ¶

14:18.558 --> 14:22.627

¶ Don't try to take me

¶ You'll never even get me
out on the floor ¶

14:37.844 --> 14:41.679
¶ In 10 minutes
I'll be late for the door ¶

14:41.681 --> 14:45.750
¶ I like that old time

14:45.752 --> 14:49.087
¶ Still like that old time
rock 'n' roll ¶

14:49.089 --> 14:52.991
¶ That kind of music
just soothes the soul ¶

14:52.993 --> 14:57.595
¶ I reminisce
about the days of old ¶

14:57.597 --> 15:00.665

15:03.036 --> 15:04.736
[music stops]

15:10.343 --> 15:11.843
Maybe we should
have called first.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.544
Well, I had the music
pretty loud

15:13.546 --> 15:15.747
I probably wouldn't have
heard the phone.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.350
[gasping]

15:19.352 --> 15:21.552
So how was the shower?

15:21.554 --> 15:24.555
- Look at this!
- What in the world?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.758
ALF, what are you
doing in my dress?

15:27.894 --> 15:29.794
Sorry, I thought it was Lynn's.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.897
You've really done it this time.

15:32.899 --> 15:37.235
Any semblance of faith or
trust I had in you is gone.

15:37.237 --> 15:39.037
Willie, my jewelry box
is missing!

15:42.242 --> 15:44.242
So are my good gold cuff links..

15:44.244 --> 15:46.244
...and my good watch!

15:46.246 --> 15:48.313
And my antique cameo!

15:48.315 --> 15:50.048
Where are they?

15:50.050 --> 15:51.449
Probably being pawned.

15:51.451 --> 15:52.817
The police are here.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.720
What'd you do, ALF?

15:55.722 --> 15:58.423
Sure, blame the guy
in the dress.

15:58.425 --> 16:01.392
Now, don't make a sound.
Stay right here.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.161
And take off that dress!

16:03.163 --> 16:06.431
Alright, but I feel it
only fair to warn you

16:06.433 --> 16:08.733
I'm not wearing
anything underneath.

16:10.437 --> 16:13.338
Willie, my man,
I gotta tell you

16:13.340 --> 16:16.174
this thing flies like the wind.

16:16.176 --> 16:18.443
Where are you?
Where, what happened?

16:18.445 --> 16:19.978
I don't know.

16:19.980 --> 16:22.113
All I did was turn
the engine on

16:22.115 --> 16:25.116
before I knew it,
I was on the freeway.

16:25.118 --> 16:26.751
What freeway?

16:26.753 --> 16:28.786
(ALF)
'The one headed for Oxnard.'

16:28.788 --> 16:30.154
[vehicle honking]

16:30.156 --> 16:31.656
Nice move, buddy!

16:31.658 --> 16:33.324
Yeah? You're another one!

16:33.326 --> 16:35.193
ALF, ALF, pull off the road.

16:35.195 --> 16:36.527
Pull the car off the road.

16:36.529 --> 16:39.263
I can't.
I'm in the fast lane.

16:39.265 --> 16:40.498
Although you'd never know it

16:40.500 --> 16:42.800
by the way these clowns
are driving.

16:42.802 --> 16:45.803
Come on, lady!
This ain't a parade!

16:45.805 --> 16:49.474
ALF, don't yell at other
drivers. They'll see you.

16:49.476 --> 16:52.310
No way.
I'm driving too fast.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.812
Hey! Ever hear of a turn signal?

16:54.814 --> 16:57.982
Just look, ALF, listen to me.
Look at the road signs.

16:57.984 --> 17:01.119
Try to find out,
locate exactly where you are.

17:01.121 --> 17:04.555
Well, eh,
I just passed the Motel 6.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.192
Hey, they're having
a beekeepers convention.

17:08.194 --> 17:09.227
[buzzing]

17:09.229 --> 17:10.695
Ouch! Ouch! Ouch!

17:10.697 --> 17:12.196
Ow! Gotta go!

17:12.198 --> 17:14.399
Could you hold this wire
while I turn on the juice?

17:14.401 --> 17:15.666
- Sure.
- Right there.

17:15.668 --> 17:19.203
You know,
that's my shortwave<i> radio!</i>

17:21.174 --> 17:24.242
Do you know how long I..

17:25.378 --> 17:28.146
L-o-o-ng.

17:28.148 --> 17:32.216
It took me ten years
to put that thing together.

17:32.218 --> 17:35.920
I'm glad to see
you haven't wasted your life.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.822
First, the phone.
And now, the radio.

17:37.824 --> 17:40.191
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what about the phone?

17:40.193 --> 17:42.026
You're on it all the time.

17:42.028 --> 17:45.029
Fine! First,
I can't use the radio.

17:45.031 --> 17:48.199
Now I can't use the phone.
What next?

17:48.201 --> 17:51.402
The curling iron?
Your toothbrush?

17:51.404 --> 17:56.207
- You use my toothbrush?
- Yours is the green one, right?

17:56.209 --> 17:57.742
It was.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.212
- William Tanner?
- Yes.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.414
I've got a delivery here for you
from the Terry Faith Company.

18:03.416 --> 18:06.617
Hold it, wait just a minute.
I'm not signing anything!

18:06.619 --> 18:07.919
No signature is necessary.

18:07.921 --> 18:11.022
This was all paid for
over the phone.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.691
I'll be back with the rest
when I get a bigger truck.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.359
Keep the faith.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.564
Four thousand dollars.

18:19.566 --> 18:22.767
Yep, that matches my total.

18:22.769 --> 18:26.537
ALF, how were you able to
purchase $4000 worth of makeup?

18:26.539 --> 18:29.240
Plastic!
I put it on your Visa.

18:29.242 --> 18:31.776
Oh, incidentally,
you're over your limit.

18:37.250 --> 18:38.316
[groaning]

18:50.730 --> 18:52.930
Whoa!

18:52.932 --> 18:54.599
Grease fire! Grease fire!

18:54.601 --> 18:55.800
(Kate)
'ALF!'

18:55.802 --> 18:58.436
(Willie)
'Oh, no! Oh, no!'

18:58.438 --> 19:01.038
(ALF)
'Never mind the curtains,
put me out!'

19:02.675 --> 19:04.675
Well, we did get new curtains.

19:04.677 --> 19:07.111
The other curtains
were new curtains.

19:07.113 --> 19:09.747
Maybe we can get Wayne
to give us ALF insurance.

19:11.017 --> 19:16.154
Before we moved offices,
we must have only had maybe 12

19:16.156 --> 19:18.089
1500 square feet.

19:18.091 --> 19:21.592
'We were literally packed
in there like sardines.'

19:21.594 --> 19:24.028
Huh! Well, that place
was so small

19:24.030 --> 19:27.598
I had to go into Sadowsky's
office to change my mind.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.433
Heh, heh, heh.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.303
Where are you going with that?

19:32.305 --> 19:34.405
I thought Mr. Schlegel
might want a snack.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.110
Heh, heh, heh.

19:39.112 --> 19:41.179
Of course,
in our new place..

19:41.181 --> 19:44.649
Oh, by the way,
did I give you a business card?

19:44.651 --> 19:49.053
'In the new place, the traffic
flow is much better.'

19:49.055 --> 19:52.290
And we've got a men
and a women's restroom.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.159
Yeah. Well, the underwriters
are pretty happy about that.

19:55.161 --> 19:58.663
Boy, they sure are.
I've never seen them so..

19:58.665 --> 20:00.331
Are you listening, Willie?

20:00.333 --> 20:02.733
[knocking on door]

20:02.735 --> 20:05.369
You know, I liked you better
as an alien.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.873
You were annoying,
but you were never boring.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.078
Oh, hi, Brian.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.381
I brought you a snack,
Mr. Schlegel.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.917
At least somebody
has compassion!

20:21.888 --> 20:23.988
What is this junk?

20:23.990 --> 20:26.691
Your favorite food.
Donuts and brownies.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.359
What are you trying to do,
kill me?

20:28.361 --> 20:32.163
I'll have you know I've got
a very delicate stomach.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.233
[burp]

20:36.369 --> 20:37.735
Nice meal, Kate.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.871
Even though the portions
were extremely small.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.274
I'm sorry
we had only one pot roast.

20:43.276 --> 20:45.710
Well, you two get these holidays
straightened out

20:45.712 --> 20:47.378
I think I'll just go
make breakfast.

20:47.380 --> 20:50.948
Not necessary,
I already made breakfast.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.117
Sloppy Joes and fiberglass.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.287
There's hair
in this tuna fish.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.491
I like it.

21:03.196 --> 21:06.797
He must be hungry.
He didn't even say grace.

21:07.767 --> 21:09.000
Grace.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.241
Is something wrong?

21:17.243 --> 21:19.744
(female #1)
'Some people won't eat red meat,
some won't eat sugar.'

21:19.746 --> 21:23.147
Some won't eat fried foods
or dairy products.

21:24.550 --> 21:27.285
You didn't eat
all the cat food too, did you?

21:27.287 --> 21:30.821
No way! I draw the line
at intestinal by-products.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.591
Take this food away, son.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.493
I'm not eating
until you let me go.

21:40.733 --> 21:44.502
[sighs]
What am I going to do?

21:45.438 --> 21:46.904
I know.

21:46.906 --> 21:48.105
What if I..

21:48.107 --> 21:50.141
What if I show you a mirror?

21:52.612 --> 21:55.279
Alright, maybe I need a shave.

21:55.281 --> 21:58.182
Is this the face
of an insurance agent?

21:58.584 --> 21:59.684
Yeah.

21:59.686 --> 22:01.452
Alright, I'm no Burt Sadowsky

22:01.454 --> 22:05.623
but then Burt Sadowsky's
not in the Million Dollar Club.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.125
This isn't..
You're not an insurance agent.

22:08.127 --> 22:10.361
You're an alien.
Can't you see that?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.964
Listen, Willie,
what do you want from me?

22:13.966 --> 22:15.800
You obviously
don't want a policy.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.436
I want you to get
your memory back.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.670
Is that it?

22:19.672 --> 22:23.541
Okay. Hey, hey,
it's coming back to me now.

22:23.543 --> 22:27.511
It's like a veil being lifted.
I'm-I'm an alien.

22:27.513 --> 22:31.182
Yeah, that's what I am. And I'm
from the planet, uh, Milsap.

22:31.184 --> 22:34.952
- Melmac.
- Fine. Can I have my pants now?

22:34.954 --> 22:36.153
You're not going to leave here!

22:36.155 --> 22:38.356
Hey! We had a deal, Willie.

22:38.358 --> 22:41.492
I'm sorry. You're just going
to have to trust me.

22:41.494 --> 22:44.328
It's far too dangerous
for you out there.

22:44.330 --> 22:46.564
Mrs. Tanner, we've received
an anonymous tip

22:46.566 --> 22:49.900
that you might be harboring
a space creature.

22:49.902 --> 22:52.136
- Space creature?
- Yes.

22:52.138 --> 22:55.840
Hairy. About three feet tall.

22:55.842 --> 22:59.176
Is, um,
is he considered dangerous?

22:59.178 --> 23:01.512
Hard to tell
until we get it to the lab.

23:01.514 --> 23:05.015
And, uh, what would you do
if-if you did get him?

23:05.017 --> 23:06.150
You know, in the lab?

23:06.152 --> 23:08.252
The usual battery of tests.

23:08.254 --> 23:12.823
We'll see how it responds
to intense heat, freezing cold.

23:12.825 --> 23:15.860
High voltage,
toxic substances

23:15.862 --> 23:18.929
pain, sleep depravation

23:18.931 --> 23:22.099
inoculation, that's needles.

23:22.101 --> 23:23.567
And of course, dissection.

23:24.370 --> 23:25.536
[gulping]

23:25.538 --> 23:27.071
Why don't you just..

23:27.073 --> 23:28.739
...pull its toe nails out?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.608
You didn't let me finish.

23:34.113 --> 23:37.281
I know what that is,
it's an anteater.

23:38.451 --> 23:40.184
Are you sure?

23:40.186 --> 23:42.653
Yeah, and it's against the law
to shoot anteaters.

23:46.392 --> 23:49.727
What are you talkin' about?
You can shoot anteaters.

23:49.729 --> 23:51.195
[spits]

23:52.198 --> 23:53.397
'I don't care what he is.'

23:53.399 --> 23:55.800
I'm gonna take him out
and butcher him.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.568
[gasps]

23:57.570 --> 23:59.804
Why do you always
get to do all the butchering?

23:59.806 --> 24:04.642
Because you usually end up
mutilating all the good meat.

24:04.644 --> 24:08.479
I'll get the chainsaw,
you make the salad.

24:09.582 --> 24:11.382
[grunts]

24:16.422 --> 24:18.422
Trevor, is there
such a thing as a cross

24:18.424 --> 24:20.658
between a kangaroo
and an aardvark?

24:20.660 --> 24:23.227
(Trevor)
'Aw, stop
putting yourself down.'

24:23.229 --> 24:24.929
I'm not talking about me.

24:24.931 --> 24:26.330
I'm talking about that thing

24:26.332 --> 24:28.766
'staring at me
from that bathroom window.'

24:28.768 --> 24:30.167
(Trevor)
'What?'

24:32.772 --> 24:33.904
I don't see nothin'.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.739
Well, it was there a second ago.

24:35.741 --> 24:37.475
And I think it was shaving.

24:37.477 --> 24:40.010
Yeah, right.
And I'm Sean Penn.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.816
[gasps]

24:45.818 --> 24:48.285
Alright, let's see
if I'm following this, Willie.

24:48.287 --> 24:51.522
There are people out there
who want to hurt me.

24:51.524 --> 24:54.658
So-so you're protecting me
by locking me

24:54.660 --> 24:57.928
naked in your bedroom
and feeding me sugar.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.763
Something like that.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.034
I'm gonna go find Kate
and see if she's found anyone

25:04.036 --> 25:05.469
to help you.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.538
Yeah, see if she can find
any help for you!

25:10.309 --> 25:12.376
It's obvious
I'm not gonna make this sale.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.447
I'm not getting anywhere
with him.

25:16.449 --> 25:18.349
D-did the doctor give you
any advice?

25:18.351 --> 25:20.451
Yeah, but it didn't help.

25:20.453 --> 25:22.620
Mrs. Ochmonek
has my rolling pin.

25:24.190 --> 25:25.956
Dad, isn't there some sort
of a psychiatric hotline

25:25.958 --> 25:26.991
we could call?

25:26.993 --> 25:29.293
Yes. 5-5-5-8-5-3-3.

25:30.663 --> 25:33.063
I-I memorized that number
when ALF moved in.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.999
Oh, sorry, ALF.

25:35.001 --> 25:37.368
ALF, what are you doing
on the phone?

25:37.370 --> 25:40.037
Ha! your goose
is cooked now, bucko!

25:40.039 --> 25:41.739
I've called the police!

25:41.741 --> 25:43.374
[laughing]

25:45.745 --> 25:47.578
He's called the police.

25:53.052 --> 25:55.519
I can't believe
you called the police.

25:55.521 --> 25:59.557
Believe it, pal.
What goes around comes around.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.825
What are we gonna do
when the police come here?

26:01.827 --> 26:04.428
Well, why don't you tell them
that they're aliens

26:04.430 --> 26:06.363
and then take their clothes?

26:06.365 --> 26:09.700
Look, who took whose clothes!

26:09.702 --> 26:12.436
You don't know
the mistake you just made!

26:12.438 --> 26:15.339
Yeah? Well, you're the one
who's making a mistake.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.707
Tangling with a man from..

26:16.709 --> 26:19.577
(all)
Michigan Life And Casualty.

26:21.380 --> 26:23.781
Now the cops are gonna
lock you up.

26:23.783 --> 26:27.351
And you'll get a taste of what
it's like to be a prisoner.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.521
I already know what that's like.
Thanks to you!

26:30.523 --> 26:33.090
I can't believe ALF
actually used your shortwave

26:33.092 --> 26:34.525
to call the president.

26:34.527 --> 26:35.759
Shh!

26:39.231 --> 26:40.464
I don't know what happened.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.066
All I know is somebody
used my radio.

26:42.068 --> 26:45.402
And now I'm a criminal,
and they're going to hang me.

26:45.404 --> 26:48.939
Willie, I don't think
they hang people anymore.

26:48.941 --> 26:51.075
But they think I'm a threat
to national security.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.076
A terrorist.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.978
Kate..

26:53.980 --> 26:56.113
...I'm not a terrorist.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.248
Honey, I know that.

26:58.250 --> 27:00.417
I'm not going to prison.

27:00.419 --> 27:01.752
I saw "Midnight Express."

27:01.754 --> 27:02.987
You remember?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.321
They made him eat bugs.

27:04.323 --> 27:05.623
Th-that was "Papillon."

27:05.625 --> 27:08.225
In "Midnight Express,"
they broke his feet.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.260
I stand corrected.

27:10.262 --> 27:11.895
How about "Stir Crazy?"

27:11.897 --> 27:12.930
That wasn't so bad.

27:12.932 --> 27:15.165
That was a comedy.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.067
Willie, stop.

27:17.069 --> 27:18.469
It's obvious
you have to tell the truth.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.937
Of-of course the truth.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.639
I'll just,
I'll explain it to them.

27:21.641 --> 27:23.941
An alien took control
of my radio.

27:23.943 --> 27:25.843
"Uh, why would he do that?"
they'll ask.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.479
And I'll say, "Because I
wouldn't let him use the phone."

27:31.017 --> 27:32.950
So you were an ex-con?

27:32.952 --> 27:35.953
Then you're familiar
with your Miranda rights.

27:35.955 --> 27:39.690
Look, I'm not the one
who's going to jail here, buddy!

27:40.826 --> 27:44.428
You're not my buddy.
You're not my buddy!

27:44.430 --> 27:47.898
But you could have been
if you hadn't taken my pants.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.201
[phone ringing]

27:53.139 --> 27:54.738
Hello?

27:57.176 --> 27:59.209
It's for Wayne Schlegel.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.217
Hello?

28:07.219 --> 28:09.520
Wayne?

28:09.522 --> 28:13.624
Wayne...I'm sorry
I lost my temper.

28:13.626 --> 28:15.225
But you see
Tubby had just come in

28:15.227 --> 28:18.495
and dumped a whole stack of
workmen comp files on my desk.

28:18.497 --> 28:22.366
And then he had the nerve
to ask me to alphabetize them.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.669
Oh, I guess I just took it
all out on you.

28:25.671 --> 28:26.670
Look, honey..

28:26.672 --> 28:30.808
I pressured you, Wayne,
and I'm sorry.

28:30.810 --> 28:33.510
I know that wasn't part
of our arrangement.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.912
Look..

28:34.914 --> 28:36.980
...if I have to share you..

28:36.982 --> 28:38.682
...so be it.

28:38.684 --> 28:42.152
There's enough
of Wayne Schlegel to go around.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.221
So let's just pretend
the whole thing never happened

28:44.223 --> 28:46.890
and I'll meet you in our usual
place in half an hour, okay?

28:46.892 --> 28:51.361
I'd love to, but I can't.
I'm being held hostage here.

28:51.363 --> 28:53.097
Oh, sure,
just like the last time

28:53.099 --> 28:56.667
when you had to go to Sweden
to accept the Nobel Prize.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.702
We are through, Mr. Schlegel!

28:58.704 --> 29:01.505
In fact, right after I finish
alphabetizing these files

29:01.507 --> 29:02.773
I'm going over to your house

29:02.775 --> 29:04.875
and telling
your wife everything.

29:04.877 --> 29:06.844
Goodbye, Wayne Schlegel!

29:08.347 --> 29:10.614
No! Hello? Hello?

29:13.185 --> 29:14.451
[glass shattering]

29:17.957 --> 29:21.391
Oh! I've just lost
a perfectly good marriage

29:21.393 --> 29:22.559
thanks to you.

29:22.561 --> 29:24.728
Not to mention a fantastic..

29:24.730 --> 29:26.029
Hey, hey!

29:26.031 --> 29:28.065
...secretary!

29:28.067 --> 29:29.633
What are we gonna do?

29:29.635 --> 29:31.568
Let's look at our options.

29:31.570 --> 29:33.137
We have no options!

29:33.139 --> 29:35.739
The police are gonna come here
and search our house

29:35.741 --> 29:40.043
for a kidnapped insurance agent
named Wayne Schlegel.

29:40.045 --> 29:42.246
Michigan Life And Casualty.

29:42.248 --> 29:44.715
I thought we didn't have
a Wayne Schlegel.

29:44.717 --> 29:46.250
We don't have a Wayne Schlegel.

29:46.252 --> 29:49.253
Instead we have an alien
from outer space.

29:49.255 --> 29:51.155
They'll just have
to be content with that.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.323
So we're just gonna give up?
Is that what you're saying?

29:53.325 --> 29:55.259
Well, it looks like
we may have no other choice.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.494
That's very sensible of you.

29:57.496 --> 29:59.296
I'll talk to the judge

29:59.298 --> 30:02.399
and tell him
I was treated very well, Willie.

30:02.401 --> 30:04.268
Well, I'm not gonna give up.

30:04.270 --> 30:05.569
- Look, ALF.
- Wayne.

30:05.571 --> 30:08.438
No, you're ALF,
and I'm Lynn.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.440
We're friends.

30:10.442 --> 30:14.244
Don't try to strike
an independent deal.

30:14.246 --> 30:16.013
Don't you remember
how close we were?

30:17.316 --> 30:19.950
Oh, ALF.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.019
What are we gonna do with you?

30:22.021 --> 30:23.520
I guess you'll just
have to love me

30:23.522 --> 30:25.689
for as long as it lasts.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.025
We will.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.951
I don't listen to that garbage.

30:53.953 --> 30:56.653
It's nothing but a bunch
of satanic messages.

30:56.655 --> 30:59.656
No, that's not true.
And you love rock 'n' roll.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.725
You even wrote me a rock song!

31:01.727 --> 31:03.927
I'll play the video for you.

31:05.664 --> 31:08.065
I'm against rock videos!

31:08.067 --> 31:11.568
They contribute to the
delinquency and destruction

31:11.570 --> 31:13.237
of the family unit.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.038
Well, this video
hasn't done that.

they are you!

ALF, you made me that video
because you cared about me.

You thought you loved me.

You live with us.

You are a part of our family.

- Oh, happy birthday, darling.

35:32.397 --> 35:33.597
Happy birthday, daddy.

35:33.599 --> 35:35.398
Oh, thank you, son.

35:35.400 --> 35:38.335
- Many more, dad.
- Thanks. Thanks, sweetheart.

35:38.337 --> 35:39.970
Thank you, ALF.

35:39.972 --> 35:41.071
Thank..

35:42.941 --> 35:44.007
Oh!

35:45.410 --> 35:47.177
Whoa! Not bad.

35:47.179 --> 35:49.246
Still waters run deep there,
William.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.119
So I'm part of the family, huh?

35:56.121 --> 35:58.755
Well, then tell me,
what side of the family

35:58.757 --> 36:01.691
does this nose come from? Ha!

36:01.693 --> 36:04.127
That's ALF's laugh!

36:04.129 --> 36:07.164
Whoa!
Where did that come from?

36:07.166 --> 36:09.799
See,
you're not a blood relative.

36:09.801 --> 36:12.135
You're-you're a part
of our family because..

36:12.137 --> 36:14.337
...because of the way
you've affected our lives.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.307
- Made them...more interesting.
- Unique.

36:17.309 --> 36:19.442
- Fun.
- Bizarre.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.149
Pan the room..

36:26.151 --> 36:27.284
...and ready..

36:27.286 --> 36:28.318

36:40.499 --> 36:44.935
Hey, back off there, Willie Bob.
Let me give it a shot.

36:46.505 --> 36:47.537
- 'ALF?'
- What?

36:47.539 --> 36:49.973
I'm going into a trance now.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.778
Ah-h-h-h-h-h.

36:57.015 --> 36:59.749
Mm-m-m.

36:59.751 --> 37:01.318
[gasping]

37:01.320 --> 37:04.554
You don't have to
make rude noises.

37:04.556 --> 37:07.891
That's alright.
I don't mind.

37:07.893 --> 37:10.093
Hey, Willie, come here.
Listen to this.

37:10.095 --> 37:12.362
Let me know
when this gets irritating, okay?

37:12.364 --> 37:14.164
[screeching]

37:15.434 --> 37:16.866
Now! Now!

37:16.868 --> 37:19.936
It's irritating almost at once.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.938
Let me see
what Willie's got in his coat?

37:23.242 --> 37:25.275
Oh! Oh, my gosh,
it's somebody's hand!

37:25.277 --> 37:27.544
Shh! It's a glove.

37:27.546 --> 37:28.945
Oh!

37:28.947 --> 37:31.348
We appreciate all the trouble
you've gone to.

37:31.350 --> 37:35.118
I mean cutting roses
so they look like radishes.

37:36.021 --> 37:37.687
And making<i> pate.</i>

37:37.689 --> 37:39.022
And very good<i> pate</i> too.

37:39.024 --> 37:40.557
Wha-what-what's in it?

37:40.559 --> 37:41.891
Oh, let me guess.

37:41.893 --> 37:44.761
There's lobster,
there's sour cream

37:44.763 --> 37:47.430
but there's-there's
something else.

37:47.432 --> 37:49.766
Play-Doh.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.469
- That's it.
- The fluorescent kind.

37:52.471 --> 37:54.871
I wanted it to be special.

37:54.873 --> 37:57.007
I'm just going to go
brush my teeth.

37:59.911 --> 38:03.046
Oh, gross! What is that?

38:03.048 --> 38:05.749
It's a slime ball.

38:05.751 --> 38:08.752
- ALF!
- I know what you're gonna say.

38:08.754 --> 38:10.887
I shouldn't bring treats
to the table

38:10.889 --> 38:13.056
unless I have enough
for everyone.

38:14.092 --> 38:15.759
Well, we're in luck.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.394
No, we're not.

38:17.396 --> 38:18.395
You sure?

38:18.397 --> 38:20.730
There's a surprise
in the center.

38:20.732 --> 38:22.666
ALF, where did you get those?

38:22.668 --> 38:23.933
Melmac.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.669
I usually buy wild cherry

38:25.671 --> 38:27.771
but all they had left was slug.

38:48.427 --> 38:50.593
- ALF.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

38:50.595 --> 38:52.462
Was I playing too loud?

38:52.464 --> 38:54.998
I didn't know
you could play the piano.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.433
Well, I was winging it.

38:56.435 --> 38:59.769
It's tough to play
without the red keys.

38:59.771 --> 39:02.639
I think you should leave this
for a qualified repairman.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.808
Well, Mr. Smarty.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.110
It's Mr. Science.

39:07.112 --> 39:10.447
For your information,
I've-I've located the problem.

39:10.449 --> 39:16.186
There's no power going into
the high-voltage transformer.

39:16.188 --> 39:19.556
- Hey, you want power?
- 'That would help.'

39:19.558 --> 39:20.623

39:26.832 --> 39:29.666
Willie, it was an accident.

39:29.668 --> 39:31.668
An accident?

39:31.670 --> 39:33.837
You almost killed me..

39:33.839 --> 39:36.306
...and you say
it was an accident?

39:37.743 --> 39:40.643
Alright, let's call it
a mistake.

39:40.645 --> 39:42.712
The droid says to the kranvall

"I'd feel even better

was a, was a..

39:57.996 --> 39:59.929
Six, six light years away!

40:01.400 --> 40:04.334
I guess you had to be there.
I was!

40:04.336 --> 40:05.969
[laughing]

40:09.040 --> 40:12.542
I'll tell you
my favorite droid joke.

40:12.544 --> 40:15.612
Wait, what's a droid?

40:15.614 --> 40:18.982
You're remembering!
ALF, you are in there!

40:25.390 --> 40:26.890
- He's starting to remember!
- Yeah.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.391
I-it must be working.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.527
Quick, let's remind him
of other things, like, um..

40:30.529 --> 40:33.196
Like the time you washed dad's
camera in the washing machine.

40:33.198 --> 40:35.698
Or, uh, the time
you waxed the driveway.

40:35.700 --> 40:38.735
Or the time you built
the termite farm in the attic.

40:38.737 --> 40:41.905
Hey, hey, I heard
it was the food of the future.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.273
You do remember!

40:43.275 --> 40:46.409
No! I-I don't even know
why I said that.

40:46.411 --> 40:50.780
You're getting me all confused.
You're-you're brainwashing me!

40:50.782 --> 40:53.049
We just want our ALF back.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.085
Why are you so hung up
on this guy anyway?

40:56.087 --> 40:58.755
He seems like nothing
but a pain in the neck.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.558
Well, not entirely.

41:01.560 --> 41:03.660
See, why do you think
we were so upset

41:03.662 --> 41:05.128
about you calling the police?

41:05.130 --> 41:07.931
It's-it's not because we were
afraid of getting caught.

41:07.933 --> 41:11.067
It's because we were afraid
of losing you.

41:11.069 --> 41:14.671
I don't wanna lose you, ALF.
You're my best friend.

41:16.107 --> 41:18.374
Come on, Brian, give us a hug.

41:21.580 --> 41:23.646

42:01.887 --> 42:03.987
You missed your ride!

42:03.989 --> 42:06.322
Yeah, I guess I did.

ALF's staying!

42:09.694 --> 42:11.861
You gave up Rhonda for us?

42:11.863 --> 42:16.332
Ah, she'll only want me more
after a couple of centuries.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.501
Aren't you gonna miss her?

42:18.503 --> 42:20.403
Yeah.

42:20.405 --> 42:22.038
But, uh..

42:22.040 --> 42:24.274
...I guess
what it boils down to is..

42:25.677 --> 42:27.544
...I'd miss you more.

42:30.248 --> 42:32.448
You love us that much?

42:33.351 --> 42:36.319
Yeah. I guess I do.

42:36.321 --> 42:39.522
We love you too, ALF.

We really do.

42:51.703 --> 42:53.336
What scratching noise?

42:53.338 --> 42:56.105
It's coming from your suitcase.

42:56.107 --> 42:57.774
What suitcase?

43:01.713 --> 43:05.348
Lucky, you bad boy!
What are you doing in there?

43:05.350 --> 43:08.351
I told him,
"No suitcase, no suitcase!"

43:08.353 --> 43:09.886
Argh!

43:09.888 --> 43:14.057
Why would I be putting a cat
in a suitcase?

43:14.059 --> 43:16.893
On a dinner plate,
I can understand.

43:16.895 --> 43:18.962
Breast of cat, but..

43:18.964 --> 43:22.198
Wait a minute!
That's crazy!

43:22.200 --> 43:24.367
But it does sound tasty.

43:25.570 --> 43:29.405
Yo, Kate, where do you
keep your casserole dishes?

43:29.407 --> 43:30.540
Why?

43:30.542 --> 43:33.176
The cat won't fit
in the toaster.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.312
Cat hairs.

43:36.314 --> 43:39.248
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

- What are you doing?
- Hey! You scared me.

44:02.407 --> 44:05.775
- You ought to wear a bell.
- What's going on here?

44:05.777 --> 44:09.912
Um, I was, uh, I was just
teaching Lucky how to tell time.

44:09.914 --> 44:12.448

44:12.450 --> 44:14.684
He's quick!
I'll give him that.

44:21.026 --> 44:23.292
No! It's not true!

44:23.294 --> 44:25.495
Brian, go get Lucky!

44:26.831 --> 44:28.464
Alright, syllogism.

44:28.466 --> 44:32.135
Insurance agents
do not eat cats.

44:32.137 --> 44:37.140
I am an insurance agent,
therefore I do not eat cats.

44:37.142 --> 44:38.508
- Yes, you do!
- But you do!

44:38.510 --> 44:40.777
- 'You do.'
- I don't!

44:40.779 --> 44:43.813
Right now, I could walk over
to that refrigerator over there

44:43.815 --> 44:48.151
you know, take out a couple
of slices of whole wheat bread

44:48.153 --> 44:52.555
a little mayo
and slap together a BLT.

44:52.557 --> 44:55.692
That's bacon, Lucky,
and tomato.

44:55.694 --> 44:58.828
[laughing]
Yeah, I could do that.

44:58.830 --> 45:01.030
But I won't.

45:01.032 --> 45:03.232
And why is that?

45:04.002 --> 45:05.301
Because..

45:07.872 --> 45:09.806
...they trust me.

45:12.644 --> 45:14.610
But don't get too comfortable.

45:19.984 --> 45:21.184
I don't know anymore!

45:21.186 --> 45:22.985
Maybe I do,
maybe I don't eat cats!

45:22.987 --> 45:24.353
I don't know! I don't..

45:24.355 --> 45:25.855
Lucky! Ah-h!

45:25.857 --> 45:27.090
Yes!

45:27.092 --> 45:28.825
It worked!

45:28.827 --> 45:30.526
He's back!

45:30.528 --> 45:32.729
What about my back?

45:32.731 --> 45:34.731
Yep, he's back.

45:34.733 --> 45:36.866
Are you okay?
What do you remember?

45:36.868 --> 45:39.936
Let's see,
the last thing I remember

45:39.938 --> 45:42.004
is this big flash of light.

45:42.006 --> 45:46.075
I smiled, because I thought
someone was taking my picture.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.610
And that's about it.

45:47.612 --> 45:49.912
Oh, and also
that term insurance

45:49.914 --> 45:52.348
is cheaper than whole life.

45:52.350 --> 45:54.751
Well, it's a start.

45:54.753 --> 45:55.918
[knocking on door]

45:55.920 --> 45:58.554
Oh, my gosh, it's the police!

45:58.556 --> 46:00.590
Now, what did you guys do?

46:00.592 --> 46:04.527
I swear if it's not one thing
with this family it's another.

46:04.529 --> 46:08.231
Hey, what am I doing
in this cheap polyester suit?

46:08.233 --> 46:09.899
Come on, ALF,
you'd better go.

46:09.901 --> 46:11.768
Fine, if you all need me

46:11.770 --> 46:14.003
I'll be
in the whirling hot tub.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.210
Okay, thanks.

46:21.212 --> 46:22.478
Good news.

46:22.480 --> 46:24.413
- We located Wayne Schlegel.
- Oh.

46:24.415 --> 46:27.450
He was in the hospital.
His wife got to him first.

46:28.453 --> 46:31.420
We'll-we'll have
to go visit him.

46:31.422 --> 46:33.089
I'm so glad we got that
cleared up.

46:33.091 --> 46:36.292
I just knew the whole thing
had to be a practical joke.

46:36.294 --> 46:37.460
[chuckles]

46:37.462 --> 46:38.928
Sorry we had to search
your home.

46:38.930 --> 46:40.663
- I'm sure you understand.
- No problem.

46:40.665 --> 46:43.332
I'll send you
one of our safety brochures.

46:43.334 --> 46:48.037
Now, remember, 33% of all
accidents happen in the home.
