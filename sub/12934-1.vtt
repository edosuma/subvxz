03:07.800 --> 03:09.460
Guan Yunchang

03:09.870 --> 03:11.890
Righteous and loyal

03:12.350 --> 03:15.980
What ill fate that met him!

03:16.130 --> 03:20.390
Would there even be another like hỉm?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.150
The word "righteous/moral" composed of the word "sheep" and "self"

03:23.450 --> 03:25.810
He's as kind as a sheep

03:26.880 --> 03:28.710
General Guan stays true to his principles

03:28.850 --> 03:32.480
He's kind and forgiving

03:33.140 --> 03:35.050
His death is a tragedy

03:36.490 --> 03:38.550
You are a wolf on the outside

03:39.050 --> 03:41.740
But has a heart of a sheep

03:42.390 --> 03:46.900
But this world belongs to wolves

03:47.600 --> 03:50.040
World of wolves!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.000
20 years ago....

03:55.390 --> 03:58.800
Kingdom of Han invasions were widespread

03:59.590 --> 04:02.860
This Cao Cao commanded a small troops

04:03.070 --> 04:06.990
Fighting across the land to bring back peace and balance

04:07.240 --> 04:12.240
Then Yuan Shao began to gather his own troops to betrayed our army

04:14.180 --> 04:16.310
With their larger army,

04:16.720 --> 04:20.620
Yuan Shao's commander attacked Boma City

04:28.700 --> 04:33.700
Our small number of troops always fight with cunning and resiliency. Winning every battle

04:35.830 --> 04:39.120
But seeing all the bloodshed,

04:39.360 --> 04:43.320
Our lieutenants were losing their morale

04:44.760 --> 04:47.150
I can lose my cites

04:47.300 --> 04:50.110
But I cannot lose the heart of my men

04:51.570 --> 04:56.310
At the time, Guan Yunchang was under my command

04:57.150 --> 04:59.590
An individual capable of anything

05:00.010 --> 05:02.330
Praised with strength of thousands

05:03.720 --> 05:05.280
I knew very clearly

05:06.350 --> 05:08.560
With this weapon at my disposable

05:08.860 --> 05:12.370
It can determine the outcome of my battles

05:12.620 --> 05:16.610
With him, I will not lose

05:18.440 --> 05:21.960
Unfortunately...the 'ace card'

05:22.390 --> 05:24.420
is in the hand of Liu Bei

05:26.140 --> 05:31.140
The battle card of another, How can I play it?

05:37.550 --> 05:40.480
Brother Yunchang..Let us eat

05:40.670 --> 05:42.350
Eating at times like this sir?

05:46.750 --> 05:48.790
- How are you?
- I want you to help me with one thing

05:49.020 --> 05:50.450
I don't know if you'd agree brother

05:51.460 --> 05:54.150
This Guan situation is weak. It doesn't matter what I say.

05:54.380 --> 05:57.300
Then good, go and kill someone for me

05:59.650 --> 06:01.890
If he's dead, then the fighting would stop?

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
Correct

06:06.040 --> 06:06.840
Who?

06:06.860 --> 06:09.840
No rush, lets eat then talk

06:10.710 --> 06:11.840
No Rush

06:13.190 --> 06:14.980
Lets kill then eat

06:20.730 --> 06:22.120
The gate is almost breached, stop it

06:22.750 --> 06:23.550
Yes

07:02.470 --> 07:04.490
Sir, Guan Yu is of the enemy

07:04.670 --> 07:05.910
How can he help us?

07:06.070 --> 07:08.260
Anyone in my camp is considered my men

07:08.440 --> 07:10.970
Letting him go is like releasing a tiger back into its jungle

07:11.130 --> 07:13.860
Brother Yuanchang, the Cao's camp has 5000 troops

07:14.010 --> 07:15.860
Can anyone stop you?

07:21.730 --> 07:24.130
I need 30 elite men, who's with me?

07:29.400 --> 07:31.570
This Guan and everyone follows different leaders,

07:31.940 --> 07:33.360
we never fought side by side as brothers

07:34.300 --> 07:35.470
But with battle of today,

07:36.440 --> 07:39.580
Everyone ignored the danger head to help me

07:40.400 --> 07:42.430
No different as if you guys are my brothers

07:43.180 --> 07:44.810
If everyone would accept me

07:45.150 --> 07:47.560
I would like to call you my brothers

07:48.000 --> 07:50.810
My brothers, please accept one bow from me

08:03.350 --> 08:08.090
This Zhang Liao likes to fight, who else?

08:11.630 --> 08:15.300
- My brothers, kill!!!!
- Kill!!!!!

08:15.450 --> 08:16.780
- Kill!!!
- Kill!!!!

08:16.990 --> 08:18.890
- Kill!!

10:36.390 --> 10:37.550
This is your men?

10:39.520 --> 10:41.520
That's his men?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.580
His highness arrives!

12:07.950 --> 12:09.430
Hear his higness

12:09.640 --> 12:13.210
Guan Yunchang is promoted to Han's Marquis of Hanshou rank

12:13.530 --> 12:17.610
General Guan please bow to receive

12:19.170 --> 12:23.100
Guan Yunchang has no talents? I cannot accepts awards without merits

12:25.250 --> 12:26.570
Brother Yunchang,

12:26.830 --> 12:31.160
You are a loyal person, only you can accept this

12:31.890 --> 12:35.510
To see his highness being oppressed, but us subjects can't do anything

12:35.660 --> 12:37.030
How can you call that loyalty?

12:38.890 --> 12:43.890
So you feel like...his highness is being oppressed here?

12:45.430 --> 12:48.810
It's always been that there'd be no sword in the palace

12:49.030 --> 12:51.740
But nowadays everyone carries one

12:52.050 --> 12:55.100
Is that not disrespect to the king?

12:57.770 --> 13:02.770
It's chaotic out there, all must carry a sword to protect his highness

13:03.290 --> 13:07.660
How can you say thats disrespectful?

13:07.860 --> 13:11.800
Under his heavenly's presence, How can you Cao Mèngdé not bow?

13:15.190 --> 13:16.860
If you dont like that, you dont have to

13:17.180 --> 13:18.840
Guan Yu dare not

13:19.540 --> 13:22.730
What's the big deal anyway

13:24.620 --> 13:27.760
Everyone go back to normal, No need to bow

13:29.090 --> 13:30.880
Stand up!

13:31.880 --> 13:33.380
Stand up..

13:35.500 --> 13:37.250
Stand up!

13:47.110 --> 13:50.770
Brother, the king has spoken

13:50.930 --> 13:53.920
Brother Yunchang , please stand up

14:49.740 --> 14:50.930
Official Guan

14:54.640 --> 14:57.910
Stand up, no need to call me that

14:58.230 --> 15:00.440
You saved my life

15:00.610 --> 15:01.650
 it's only right to call you that

15:01.830 --> 15:04.970
You saved your own life. Don't look down on yourself

15:06.140 --> 15:08.250
Sir Guan is a...big hero.

15:08.490 --> 15:11.100
Saving my life is as if you allow me to be reborn.

15:14.030 --> 15:15.380
Guan Yu is not like that

15:15.760 --> 15:17.460
Me and Cao Cao must've misunderstood each other

15:18.650 --> 15:19.860
Sir Guan...

15:20.890 --> 15:23.810
Does have a misunderstand with me

15:24.650 --> 15:25.740
I'll go back to work

15:25.890 --> 15:27.190
Right.

15:28.530 --> 15:32.030
Then how can you explain it sir Cao?

15:32.210 --> 15:33.200
Drink some water first

15:35.320 --> 15:36.250
Sir Guan,

15:36.810 --> 15:40.650
This paddy used to be wild and abandoned

15:40.820 --> 15:44.150
We came here, explored, planted barley

15:44.570 --> 15:48.030
From Luoyang to Xuchang there are thousands

15:48.460 --> 15:51.930
Within 6 years, nobody died from starvation

15:52.090 --> 15:54.260
This Cao Cao is kinda good huh

15:56.340 --> 15:59.100
The Liu's house is crumbling

15:59.630 --> 16:02.350
So our Cao helped them fix it up

16:03.670 --> 16:08.310
But then theres people saying I tore down his house

16:08.460 --> 16:11.420
Can anyone see this injustice?

16:12.080 --> 16:14.910
You do have poetic words Sir Cao

16:15.140 --> 16:18.110
What poetry, the truth is clear as day

16:18.290 --> 16:21.470
The truth is Cao Cao borrowed his heavenly's word to do it

16:21.690 --> 16:23.840
Using his heavenly's word

16:24.310 --> 16:25.780
I've heard this

16:26.560 --> 16:28.160
It's completely nonsense

16:28.340 --> 16:31.850
It's really His highness that used my Cao Cao name to order such a thing

16:32.340 --> 16:35.770
I know, some will always believe rumors

16:35.970 --> 16:38.370
Even 2000 years later, there'd still be believers (lol. foreshadowing?)

16:38.660 --> 16:40.400
But it's still nonsense rumors

16:40.710 --> 16:44.100
Only 2 type will believe these stuff

16:44.430 --> 16:48.000
1 is stupid, the other is bad guy.

16:48.180 --> 16:51.590
Liu Bei is the bad one, and you're the dumb one.

16:51.750 --> 16:54.290
Liu Bei is taking advantage of you!

16:58.340 --> 17:01.430
Good! I like you brother

17:02.220 --> 17:07.220
Dare to accept your act, dare to love and hate

17:08.300 --> 17:13.300
Stay with me, work for me

17:16.790 --> 17:19.619
If it weren't for 230 Liu members you held

17:19.790 --> 17:20.910
You dare say those words?

17:23.260 --> 17:24.790
Sir Guan

17:25.329 --> 17:27.910
You never kill those that doesnt deserve it

17:28.820 --> 17:29.810
Right?

17:32.150 --> 17:34.560
Cao Mengde, what are you talking about?

17:34.770 --> 17:35.620
Hurry and work

17:39.960 --> 17:43.150
Your Highness, Cao Cao make you do such labor work?

17:44.480 --> 17:45.610
Sit down

17:46.780 --> 17:49.150
Just look, even generals are out here

17:53.870 --> 17:55.120
What?

17:55.300 --> 17:57.180
You feel that officials, and heavenly bloodlines that

17:57.380 --> 17:59.430
doing things like this, is out of place right?

18:00.330 --> 18:02.710
But unusual times calls for unusual things

18:02.880 --> 18:04.250
Don't stress too much over it

18:08.400 --> 18:11.650
Your highness, you ever thing of leaving here?

18:13.330 --> 18:14.900
These past decades,

18:15.100 --> 18:17.540
Do you know how this King been living?

18:18.170 --> 18:20.350
I move from this palace to that palace,

18:20.720 --> 18:23.270
From this dog hole to this shit hole

18:24.370 --> 18:26.580
I eat spoiled wheat and drink dirty water

18:26.770 --> 18:27.940
And those around me,

18:28.100 --> 18:29.840
They eat off of theirs fallen comrades

18:29.990 --> 18:31.610
Even drinking their blood.

18:32.020 --> 18:35.200
A world so big, but no place for a King to stay put

18:35.390 --> 18:37.070
What kind of world is this?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.920
Do you know what Cao Cao brought

18:42.120 --> 18:43.500
the first time I met hỉm?

18:44.380 --> 18:47.750
White steamed buns, and sizzling meat balls

18:48.330 --> 18:49.890
And a warm cozy bed

18:50.040 --> 18:53.650
Can buns and meatballs be traded for the Han Kingdom like that?

18:55.450 --> 18:57.850
Cao Mengde never said he wants to be king

18:58.740 --> 19:01.690
He doesn't believe that one King can change the world.

19:01.890 --> 19:03.220
Your highness is of heaven's orders.

19:03.770 --> 19:06.870
How can you change the world when you don't believe in the heaven's above

19:07.020 --> 19:09.770
Potential, having potential can change the world.

19:10.390 --> 19:12.480
My kingdom now belongs to Cao Cao

19:12.690 --> 19:14.130
Because Cao Cao is stronger.

19:14.830 --> 19:18.300
But I believe that I will be stronger than him one day

19:18.500 --> 19:21.440
By then, Cao Cao willl willingly present the kingdom back to me

19:23.740 --> 19:25.150
If it's true about the heavenly's orders

19:25.330 --> 19:27.750
Then sooner or later the kingdom will be mine.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.520
Sir Guan...

19:47.640 --> 19:48.990
Sir Guan...

19:49.170 --> 19:49.970
Little Hầu,

19:50.430 --> 19:52.700
How's your father? He's well?

19:52.870 --> 19:56.730
He's alot better, the doctor say he needs to continue taking medicine

19:56.880 --> 19:57.680
Sir Guan

19:58.190 --> 20:00.350
Are the rice cooked? I'll go check

20:00.530 --> 20:02.620
It's okay sir, we're just early today

20:02.810 --> 20:04.090
It's no rush big brother.

20:06.830 --> 20:07.660
He is....

20:07.790 --> 20:09.860
It's Cao Mengde, sir Cao

20:10.140 --> 20:11.580
- You are...
- We'll return later

20:11.760 --> 20:13.350
Let's go

20:13.550 --> 20:14.250
They are....

20:14.250 --> 20:16.600
They came to the city 1 month ago

20:16.750 --> 20:18.950
Can't find jobs, nor any food

20:19.360 --> 20:22.530
They in your kingodm. Can you think of something for them?

20:23.360 --> 20:26.650
Don't worry, I'll take care of this situation

20:26.800 --> 20:28.570
Big Brother Guan, He's an evil person.

20:28.730 --> 20:29.810
Don't say that Lil Hầu

20:30.000 --> 20:30.870
Lil Hầu

20:31.280 --> 20:33.120
Sir Cao is our golden ticket

20:33.640 --> 20:37.370
Take this and buy medicine dad, hurry!

20:38.280 --> 20:38.940
Sir Cao,

20:38.940 --> 20:39.740
Yunchang brother,

20:40.510 --> 20:41.350
Goodbye

20:41.520 --> 20:42.890
Goodbye

20:55.540 --> 20:56.430
My ladies,

20:56.620 --> 20:59.440
I've returned those dirty things

21:03.800 --> 21:06.340
2nd Brother greets sisters

21:09.000 --> 21:11.960
Kỳ Lan, why don't you greet 2nd brother,

21:12.130 --> 21:13.410
With people like him,

21:14.080 --> 21:15.020
there's no need for manners

21:15.160 --> 21:19.690
Kỳ Lan, it's all Cao Cao's plan

21:19.860 --> 21:22.560
Big brother always trust 2nd brother

21:22.750 --> 21:26.000
You bout to marry into the Liu Family

21:26.200 --> 21:28.360
Don't you trust Liu brother

21:28.550 --> 21:29.670
You can't predict a person mind

21:30.400 --> 21:33.150
Everyone knows that if Guan General

21:33.330 --> 21:35.410
Wants to leave then

21:35.590 --> 21:37.520
Noone can stop him

21:38.730 --> 21:41.920
I want you to meet up with Liu brother

21:42.690 --> 21:46.400
Especially while Cao Cao is busy fighting with Yuan Shao at Xuchang

21:46.630 --> 21:48.020
That's helping big brother Liu

21:49.500 --> 21:50.550
Lil sis is right

21:51.080 --> 21:53.080
2nd brother need not worry about us

21:53.250 --> 21:55.810
Why not do it like Kỳ Lan said.

21:58.740 --> 21:59.540
2nd brother

22:00.680 --> 22:01.970
I beg you

22:02.200 --> 22:03.660
Please go find big brother Liu

22:04.480 --> 22:05.280
Kỳ Lan ,

22:06.060 --> 22:07.720
2nd brother himself knows what to do

22:07.880 --> 22:09.710
You and him are from the same town

22:09.950 --> 22:12.460
You of all should know who he is very well

22:12.900 --> 22:14.670
Please give Guan Yu for cannot comply

22:16.300 --> 22:17.390
Please excuse me

22:18.880 --> 22:20.610
Then why are you here?

22:33.290 --> 22:34.250
Not tired today?

22:34.440 --> 22:35.340
Not tired!

22:36.490 --> 22:37.700
Let us rest for a bit

22:37.890 --> 22:38.690
Okay.

22:40.090 --> 22:42.010
This are the things I painted today

22:42.170 --> 22:43.430
Is it pretty?

22:43.580 --> 22:45.170
Check it yourself

22:45.370 --> 22:46.490
Do it more careful

22:52.080 --> 22:53.150
Let me help you

23:01.380 --> 23:03.100
- Mom...
- My daughter is home?

23:03.260 --> 23:04.060
- Dad...
- You're home?

23:04.110 --> 23:05.130
- Are you tired daughter?
- Not tired

23:44.660 --> 23:47.430
Heard the cow carriage guy did it

23:47.620 --> 23:48.660
You didnt know?

23:48.820 --> 23:51.220
He ran away early this morning

23:51.360 --> 23:52.570
Alright, stop gathering here

23:52.730 --> 23:53.560
Disperse

23:55.440 --> 23:59.060
General Liu is here, we can live in peace now

24:04.860 --> 24:05.720
General Liu

24:07.800 --> 24:09.550
General Liu

24:19.300 --> 24:22.860
Look sis, isnt that the cow carriage guy?

24:23.000 --> 24:23.820
Don't speak nonsense

24:24.000 --> 24:26.710
The guy is now big General Guan Yunchang

24:30.860 --> 24:34.080
Our peasants can live in peace with the General here

24:35.800 --> 24:36.750
General Liu

24:37.860 --> 24:38.910
This is our daughter

24:39.110 --> 24:39.910
Little lady..

24:40.460 --> 24:42.520
Right!! Cheers to everyone

24:43.190 --> 24:44.270
Cheers!

24:47.390 --> 24:51.180
Cao army is here...

25:07.620 --> 25:09.510
2nd brother, hurry

25:10.160 --> 25:14.760
Dad...Mom...

25:22.320 --> 25:26.100
You say that unofficial wife of Liu Bei

25:26.380 --> 25:27.450
doesnt know Guan Yu

25:27.670 --> 25:30.240
from her home town Hedong ?

25:30.520 --> 25:31.320
Correct

25:35.410 --> 25:37.040
Any news about Liu Bei?

25:37.200 --> 25:38.540
Liu Bei's fighting Yuan Shao

25:38.720 --> 25:41.090
In battle of Boma, Guan Yu slain general Yan Liang

25:41.290 --> 25:43.390
Yuan Shao got upset and wants to kill Liu Bei

25:43.750 --> 25:44.860
Then is he dead?

25:45.060 --> 25:46.250
For now there isnt any news

25:53.420 --> 25:54.220
Come on!

25:57.490 --> 25:58.470
Get up son

25:59.020 --> 26:00.910
Dad, lets play again

26:01.050 --> 26:04.380
I told you many times.

26:05.050 --> 26:06.520
General, you are from Hedong right?

26:06.710 --> 26:07.510
Yes

26:07.610 --> 26:09.400
Do you know how to cook Hedong food?

26:09.640 --> 26:10.570
No!

26:11.790 --> 26:12.750
You know general

26:13.370 --> 26:16.410
Yeah, general know for sure

26:19.180 --> 26:22.950
Hedong food has strong flavors, suitable with my liquor

26:23.140 --> 26:23.970
Here, try it

26:24.160 --> 26:27.130
Master brewed it himself, its called Vân Xuân Liquor

26:27.300 --> 26:30.760
Just invitation to drink, why prepared troops outside?

26:30.930 --> 26:32.320
Afraid that Guan Yu will attack?

26:32.510 --> 26:35.180
There isn't enough supply for the war

26:35.830 --> 26:38.460
I ordered that supplies couldn't be use to brew liquor

26:38.920 --> 26:41.910
If we brew liquor , penalty is 'head-off'

26:42.230 --> 26:43.770
Then what about the person that drinks it?

26:46.210 --> 26:47.010
Guilty as well!

26:47.570 --> 26:49.700
Then it's General Cao that want to use liquor to kill

26:52.240 --> 26:55.090
Looks like you're scared to drink

26:56.020 --> 26:58.690
Having liquor to drink, why scared?

27:01.930 --> 27:02.790
Good!

27:05.470 --> 27:06.370
General Guan

27:07.460 --> 27:10.060
Us two sitting here drinking and enjoying,

27:10.610 --> 27:12.760
Isn't that against the norm a little bit?

27:12.950 --> 27:15.190
General makes the law, I don't follow it, that is normal.

27:15.410 --> 27:17.650
Well said, General Guan

27:18.180 --> 27:20.990
Good food is rare in this chaotic time

27:21.250 --> 27:25.260
It's the best we have of your home town food 

27:26.410 --> 27:27.930
Try it

27:37.750 --> 27:39.680
Do you miss home?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.220
I do not have a home

27:43.830 --> 27:47.310
I let all Liu family members home aldready

27:48.650 --> 27:52.220
Commanded Zhang Liao to take 50 men and escort them

27:56.880 --> 27:58.380
I respect your act of righteousness

27:58.640 --> 28:00.890
Guan General say that i'm righteous

28:01.250 --> 28:03.410
I dare not accept it

28:03.860 --> 28:05.490
I said you acted righteously

28:06.050 --> 28:07.630
Not saying that you are righteous

28:12.550 --> 28:14.480
Lets just say I'm a nobody

28:14.820 --> 28:16.140
Come, General Guan

28:17.160 --> 28:19.040
Drink with me

28:19.260 --> 28:20.900
I dont understand one thing

28:21.620 --> 28:23.740
Why are you lowering yourself like this

28:23.950 --> 28:27.180
If it brings me days of peacefulness

28:27.360 --> 28:29.850
Then I'm always willing to lower myself 

28:30.030 --> 28:31.660
Guan Yu only know a few barbaric fighting skills

28:32.050 --> 28:33.450
How can that bring tranquility?

28:33.790 --> 28:35.490
Plus the Cao's camp has many talents

28:35.650 --> 28:37.560
Me staying here will only be a bother

28:38.240 --> 28:42.870
Then what about your brothers Liu Bei and Zhang Fei

28:43.140 --> 28:45.030
Everyone knows brother Liu Bei moral 

28:45.640 --> 28:47.830
Cause we don't have hatred here?

28:48.830 --> 28:49.860
Also no love

28:50.760 --> 28:51.740
Then its easy

28:52.160 --> 28:55.070
Guan Yunchang join my side, you can have anything

28:55.790 --> 28:56.590
Hows that

29:00.710 --> 29:03.800
You released the Liu Family, I'm debted to you

29:03.980 --> 29:05.430
I know how to repay it

29:06.180 --> 29:08.690
But in the end Liu Bei is still my sworn brother

29:09.240 --> 29:12.210
When there is news of him , I leave right away

29:12.540 --> 29:16.290
If General Cao thinks that it's like letting a tiger back home

29:16.430 --> 29:17.710
Then its best you kill me

29:18.710 --> 29:23.710
Why are you only loyal to Liu Bei?

29:27.810 --> 29:29.960
If I, Guan Yu, only sway with the wind

29:30.470 --> 29:33.840
Me staying here will bring you trouble eventually

29:34.390 --> 29:35.420
Well said

29:42.650 --> 29:45.500
Only liquor can release sorrow

29:45.890 --> 29:49.400
One's life doesnt have much chance of drinking, singing

29:49.630 --> 29:52.270
I wrote that line.

29:57.200 --> 29:58.070
Did you know that?

29:58.230 --> 30:02.250
You are not the first to break my liquor law

30:02.560 --> 30:03.570
Who else is there?

30:07.440 --> 30:09.840
The grandson of Kong Qiu (Confucius)

30:12.290 --> 30:13.970
General Kong Rong ?

30:14.170 --> 30:16.050
What general?

30:17.410 --> 30:19.860
Kong Rong giving a pear is easy

30:20.250 --> 30:21.490
But him giving up a bowl of liquor

30:22.660 --> 30:24.320
Is harder than me convincing you to stay

30:26.720 --> 30:27.470
Come

30:27.470 --> 30:28.270
Drink up

31:17.470 --> 31:20.140
Alright, I'm here, thank you

31:23.670 --> 31:25.850
You said you don't have a home!

31:25.980 --> 31:27.590
I'll gift one to you

31:27.780 --> 31:29.840
Would you like to stay brother?

31:31.200 --> 31:32.360
You say this is the place?

31:33.160 --> 31:34.320
This is it!

31:38.950 --> 31:39.780
Thank you

31:42.040 --> 31:43.150
Thank you

32:48.830 --> 32:52.290
In your heart, you never forgot Kỳ Lan right?

32:52.580 --> 32:54.410
For so long, my heart has been empty

32:56.500 --> 32:58.960
Why not let me have a good dream?

32:59.830 --> 33:02.830
Your heart is empty, how can you have a good dream?

33:06.080 --> 33:07.690
Sir, the potent is in the food

33:07.840 --> 33:09.340
The potent lasts 4 hours

33:09.510 --> 33:11.620
I've paralyzed the girl using pressure points

33:14.240 --> 33:17.960
Before dawn, noone is allow close

33:30.070 --> 33:32.570
Sister, please respect yourself

33:33.880 --> 33:35.960
It's only a dream

33:37.240 --> 33:38.960
No need to be afraid

33:39.150 --> 33:41.500
Even so, I cannot be disrespectful

33:41.700 --> 33:45.100
Even in a dream, you dare not love me?

33:45.270 --> 33:48.180
You weren't scared to kill for me in the past

33:51.990 --> 33:53.750
I only killed to save you

33:55.160 --> 34:00.070
If you won't say it, how can I know what you think?

34:00.280 --> 34:03.280
If you won't say it..., how can I know... what you think?

34:03.450 --> 34:08.449
Let me know....what you are thinking...

34:10.159 --> 34:11.280
Outrageous !

34:12.239 --> 34:14.360
I only know that you're my sister-in-law

34:20.800 --> 34:22.330
Get down here!

34:24.530 --> 34:25.469
How dare you!

34:27.540 --> 34:28.880
Who are you?

34:30.949 --> 34:32.750
General Liu sent me here

34:32.889 --> 34:35.190
Sir Liu is at Nhữ Dương...Yuan Shao's Camp

34:36.870 --> 34:41.030
General Guan, I cannot live

34:42.060 --> 34:43.320
General Guan...

34:44.100 --> 34:45.690
General Guan...

34:46.110 --> 34:47.070
General Guan...

34:47.360 --> 34:48.639
General Guan...

34:54.600 --> 34:56.170
I want to see Cao Cao

35:33.930 --> 35:35.480
General Cao left the city to handle things

35:35.660 --> 35:36.750
Don't know when he's back.

35:39.920 --> 35:42.920
Tell General Cao, Guan Yu say goodbye!

36:09.340 --> 36:12.750
He wants to go, let him go

36:13.540 --> 36:16.340
Sir, that is not very wise

36:16.490 --> 36:18.450
I've made a promise to him before

36:18.770 --> 36:20.540
Now that the battle stage is set

36:20.690 --> 36:22.240
But that's the exact reason

36:22.390 --> 36:24.320
We have to discuss carefully

36:24.910 --> 36:26.960
How to handle the Yuan Shao situation

36:27.150 --> 36:28.890
Now, Liu Bei is with Yuan Shao's Camp

36:29.090 --> 36:32.440
If we let Guan Yunchang go, thats like letting a tiger grow wings

36:32.590 --> 36:33.390
The advisor is right sir

36:33.630 --> 36:35.380
Guan Yu knows we poisonsed him

36:35.600 --> 36:37.780
For sure he is upset with us

36:39.790 --> 36:41.670
I aldready said it

36:41.800 --> 36:44.340
If he wants to leave let him leave

36:45.060 --> 36:47.120
You all hear me clearly?

36:52.160 --> 36:53.410
You said that

36:54.110 --> 36:57.820
One of Yuan Shao's General wants to defect?

36:58.000 --> 36:59.880
General Trương is smart and brave,

37:00.070 --> 37:02.900
But is not seen as important, so he defected to us

37:04.480 --> 37:08.160
Not seen as important then you defect?

37:08.510 --> 37:10.340
Don't know what's the guy thinking

37:12.360 --> 37:17.010
You recommended him, you take care of it

37:17.190 --> 37:18.040
Thank you sir

37:21.680 --> 37:23.210
Yuan Shao is about to invade

37:24.700 --> 37:28.010
Sun Quan from Jiangdong will take advantage of this

37:28.170 --> 37:30.330
What must we do?

37:31.330 --> 37:33.720
Select 5000 to invade Jiangdong

37:33.900 --> 37:37.630
Send 39 assassins to eliminate Gen. Tôn Gia

37:40.110 --> 37:41.960
Then proceed as you said

37:49.400 --> 37:50.580
Sister

37:51.370 --> 37:52.620
Hello!

37:53.480 --> 37:56.170
We can head out

38:02.150 --> 38:04.500
Thank you for your gifts Brother Guan

38:04.630 --> 38:09.290
Thank you big brother Guan

38:09.450 --> 38:13.870
Stand up...

38:14.030 --> 38:16.960
Everyone stand up

38:17.220 --> 38:20.570
Everyone stand up

38:25.860 --> 38:28.280
Everything here is from General Cao

38:28.740 --> 38:30.970
If you wanna thank someone

38:31.110 --> 38:32.160
Thank Sir Cao

38:32.260 --> 38:33.750
Sir Guan, we were just there

38:33.890 --> 38:35.850
General Cao is done with our residence permit

38:35.980 --> 38:38.020
It's all done

38:38.150 --> 38:38.950
That's good

38:39.030 --> 38:42.960
Big brother Guan, bring this with you on the trip

38:43.190 --> 38:46.510
Keep it to take care of your dad

38:46.680 --> 38:48.900
Remember to listen to your mom! Be good!

38:54.870 --> 38:56.190
Everyone take care of yourself!

38:59.140 --> 39:03.960
Brother Guan...

39:13.490 --> 39:15.220
Let us go sister-in-law

39:21.670 --> 39:26.670
- Take care

41:16.100 --> 41:18.710
Wait...go go....

41:19.630 --> 41:20.560
Look, it's still fresh

41:20.710 --> 41:21.710
- No thank you.
- Just take it

41:21.840 --> 41:23.940
I don't really need it

41:24.040 --> 41:25.230
How much for these?

41:25.300 --> 41:26.540
This?

41:33.690 --> 41:34.820
Exit the carriage

41:44.440 --> 41:45.240
Travel papers?

41:47.370 --> 41:48.690
I am Guan Yu

41:48.870 --> 41:50.280
How can I believe that

41:50.580 --> 41:52.750
just because you say it?

41:52.960 --> 41:54.130
2nd brother...

42:06.910 --> 42:09.670
General, everything okay?

42:13.200 --> 42:14.600
The lady must get out also

42:14.770 --> 42:16.510
She has to get out too?

42:17.100 --> 42:18.790
Please dont make it hard for me

42:24.270 --> 42:26.780
Sorry to bother sister

42:49.040 --> 42:52.980
Kong Xiu of Dongling,
by his highness order, To capture Guan Yu

42:54.120 --> 42:56.660
2nd brother...

42:56.860 --> 42:57.660
2nd brother...

43:01.770 --> 43:02.950
2nd brother...

43:05.700 --> 43:07.170
2nd brother...

44:51.430 --> 44:53.070
2nd brother...

45:13.770 --> 45:14.600
2nd brother...

45:15.070 --> 45:15.870
Hurry!

45:47.980 --> 45:49.800
Cao Cao made me a promise

45:50.110 --> 45:51.810
If Guan Yu wants to leave

45:51.960 --> 45:53.390
Then you must let me pass

45:53.510 --> 45:55.310
That's between you and General Cao

45:55.430 --> 45:57.050
I'm just following orders

45:57.170 --> 45:59.190
Is it Cao Cao or someone else

45:59.480 --> 46:01.850
That wants me dead?

46:02.010 --> 46:04.810
Order to Kill came from the King

47:45.670 --> 47:47.400
Why must you kill I, Guan Yu?

47:47.980 --> 47:49.420
Can't object the king's order

48:58.830 --> 49:00.890
Looks like things calmed down

49:01.900 --> 49:04.240
We'll head North tomorrow

49:05.190 --> 49:06.380
I won't bother you further.

49:12.780 --> 49:13.580
2nd brother,

49:14.350 --> 49:16.060
What happened today

49:16.410 --> 49:18.050
Noone wants that to happen.

49:20.770 --> 49:23.790
I should only kill on the battlefield

49:24.040 --> 49:27.410
Seeing how determined he was, you had to do it

49:27.880 --> 49:30.500
I know you have moral and values

49:30.700 --> 49:33.590
But the heaven gave you this gift of martial arts

49:33.820 --> 49:37.250
To let you restore order, fight off evil

49:38.410 --> 49:42.900
Guan Yu is just a normal martial artist, not deserving like you said

49:43.800 --> 49:44.760
Sister-in-law

49:45.250 --> 49:47.070
Keep this knife

49:47.340 --> 49:48.830
In case of dangers

49:50.800 --> 49:52.210
But you saved my many times

49:53.920 --> 49:55.410
Times I've killed is even more

50:16.320 --> 50:20.020
It's almost dawn, lets go to we can make it

51:27.970 --> 51:31.040
Careful sister, stay close to me

51:57.810 --> 51:58.700
Han Fu

52:00.030 --> 52:01.590
Still remember me?

52:03.180 --> 52:04.430
Big Brother Guan

52:04.680 --> 52:06.810
How are you now?

52:09.330 --> 52:11.630
This is the wife of Liu Bei

52:15.640 --> 52:18.110
Sir Guan, how are things?

52:18.340 --> 52:20.400
Can't be compared to how you're doing

52:20.620 --> 52:22.360
I think all the subordinates here

52:22.490 --> 52:24.700
All of them are your brothers

52:25.000 --> 52:26.780
It's all because of Dong Zhuo

52:26.980 --> 52:29.630
I'm like this after he started that fire

52:30.730 --> 52:33.390
How's your situation?

52:34.140 --> 52:37.060
No matter how hard I try, it's not like before

52:37.210 --> 52:38.290
Such a shame!

52:38.820 --> 52:40.300
Everyone knows,

52:40.810 --> 52:44.750
weapons from your family are the best

52:45.180 --> 52:47.980
May be they were too good,

52:48.160 --> 52:50.850
Causing my family to be like this

52:54.260 --> 52:56.110
If it weren't for brother Guan's help

52:56.290 --> 52:58.640
Then it's not only an arm that I'm missing.

52:59.260 --> 53:02.630
Chaotic times, nobody can predict the future.

53:02.810 --> 53:03.920
To be honest.

53:05.690 --> 53:07.530
I want to return to Brother Liu Bei

53:07.730 --> 53:09.330
Why don't you and other brothers

53:09.550 --> 53:11.460
follow big brother Liu as well

53:13.620 --> 53:14.610
I won't go.

53:15.320 --> 53:17.940
I've followed the 2 general for 10 odd years

53:18.240 --> 53:20.840
Also, I'm not as daring to kill anymore

53:22.380 --> 53:24.950
Then I wont force you

53:25.840 --> 53:28.520
Today, I'm came with a favor

53:28.790 --> 53:30.980
Hoping you could lend us a boat to escort sister back.

53:33.750 --> 53:37.420
Brother Guan, why must we keep fighting?

53:39.660 --> 53:42.070
Haven't this country got enough deaths?

53:46.770 --> 53:48.250
Back in the day we fought

53:48.970 --> 53:51.310
Only wanting to seek peace

53:52.670 --> 53:56.970
Every since General Cao ruled till now

53:57.530 --> 53:58.990
Things have been good.

54:00.440 --> 54:02.540
You can even call it peacefull

54:02.910 --> 54:05.330
You are now under Cao Cao?

54:10.670 --> 54:12.400
I've just a normal person

54:13.390 --> 54:15.320
General Cao only wants me,

54:15.910 --> 54:18.040
To live righteously

54:18.990 --> 54:21.160
Can you let me go just for today?

54:22.490 --> 54:23.500
Brother Guan

54:25.010 --> 54:27.210
I'm no match for you

54:27.670 --> 54:30.710
But orders are orders

54:45.800 --> 54:46.920
Brother Guan,

54:47.190 --> 54:49.170
Why didn't you dodge it?

54:49.550 --> 54:51.400
You know it's poisoned

54:51.610 --> 54:53.650
Because we are brothers

54:55.570 --> 54:57.250
You are not my opponent little brother

54:57.830 --> 54:59.760
So I allow you one move

55:02.780 --> 55:04.090
This move,

55:04.270 --> 55:06.430
Ends our ties!

55:11.790 --> 55:12.920
Why won't you fight back?

55:14.870 --> 55:16.900
Because we are brothers

55:17.150 --> 55:20.580
How can I kill you with my own hands?

55:21.690 --> 55:24.880
Meng Tan...

55:27.560 --> 55:28.810
Big brother...

55:29.730 --> 55:31.080
I will kill him...

55:31.210 --> 55:36.210
Kill him....

56:38.980 --> 56:39.780
2nd brother...

56:40.180 --> 56:40.980
Run!

56:43.480 --> 56:45.390
Hurry!

57:21.110 --> 57:22.340
After them!

57:31.550 --> 57:32.820
2nd brother...

57:33.150 --> 57:34.590
2nd brother...

57:35.060 --> 57:36.170
2nd brother...

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:50.740
Sister

01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:53.920
Sister-in-law

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:56.640
It's alright now.

01:02:06.270 --> 01:02:09.170
I will kill you with this sword

01:02:09.310 --> 01:02:11.280
To revenge my brother

01:02:11.530 --> 01:02:13.470
There's no pity in my death

01:02:13.920 --> 01:02:16.070
Let my sister go...

01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:44.160
2nd brother...

01:02:44.540 --> 01:02:45.510
2nd brother...

01:02:57.290 --> 01:02:58.740
Who are you?

01:02:59.260 --> 01:03:01.570
Everyday you come to visit me?

01:03:03.730 --> 01:03:05.190
Who are you?

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:06.530
General

01:03:11.130 --> 01:03:12.860
Who are you?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.060
General..

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.930
General's awake

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.580
I'm a monk here at the temple

01:03:56.810 --> 01:03:57.670
Buddhist name is Phổ Tịnh.

01:03:59.770 --> 01:04:01.600
Thank you for saving me

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:03.460
Please sit!

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:09.610
I've only help with the medicine

01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.170
These past days,

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:14.480
Lady Kỳ Lan took care of you

01:04:14.680 --> 01:04:16.190
Praying for you day and night

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:18.270
Pray that Buddha would look over you

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.910
That's debt

01:04:21.680 --> 01:04:24.670
Your poison has soaked into your bones

01:04:25.060 --> 01:04:26.330
Sorry that I'm incapable

01:04:26.770 --> 01:04:28.680
I can only cure the outside.

01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.840
Later on with cold days and rainy nights,

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:34.350
You will be in deep pain

01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:38.100
Just being alive is good

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:42.150
Live you must, live righteously

01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:45.130
One thing tho... dont live in suffering and pain

01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:49.060
I, Guan, dont have the smarts

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:51.500
Only know to seek pain and suffering

01:04:51.830 --> 01:04:53.070
Not quite.

01:04:53.930 --> 01:04:57.090
Sufferings sometimes seeks us

01:04:57.300 --> 01:04:58.610
But that's aoky

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:27.160
Where's General Guan

01:05:27.590 --> 01:05:32.590
He asked me to escort you to General Liu

01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:37.340
Where did 2nd brother go?

01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:39.050
He did not say

01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:43.270
The general only asked the way to head North.

01:05:43.550 --> 01:05:46.390
I think...he wants too

01:05:46.540 --> 01:05:48.360
Divert the trailing enemy North

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:53.060
So that you'll make it back safely

01:06:45.010 --> 01:06:46.440
You are Guan Yu?

01:06:47.400 --> 01:06:51.450
And you are Bian Xi, the one that killed 5000 innocents in Peng Chau?

01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:55.200
It's 5000 rebels

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:59.250
There's no pity in their deaths.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:03.120
I've heard you were a rebel once.

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.000
Had to do it, when you don't have anything to eat

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:10.360
But even so you won't have anything to eat

01:07:10.530 --> 01:07:12.350
You see how good I eat now?

01:07:14.670 --> 01:07:16.070
You must right your wrongs

01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.790
You're just like me

01:07:17.950 --> 01:07:18.800
- Not the same

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.900
I don't kill to make a living

01:07:23.550 --> 01:07:24.350
Wrong!

01:07:26.670 --> 01:07:28.650
You're just like me!

01:07:29.030 --> 01:07:29.830
Kill!!!!

01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:33.140
Kill!!!!

01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:23.500
Yuan Shao's 10000 men arrived at Guandu

01:08:23.800 --> 01:08:26.670
Hundreds of ships on the rive

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.800
They're boasting , making noise

01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:32.729
Looks like an all attacked, lion praying on rabbits

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:36.649
This Yuan Shao is barbaric, wanna be a lion?

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:38.680
Divide up into small formations and ambush him

01:08:39.930 --> 01:08:42.950
Even the mighties lion can't handle that

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:45.529
Where is Liu Bei troops?

01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:50.050
Nhữ Dương, only 1000 men

01:08:50.859 --> 01:08:54.870
Liu Bei's at Nhữ Dương, why's Guan Yu heading North?

01:08:59.350 --> 01:09:03.000
Từ Đổng Lĩnh Khổng Tú đến Lạc Dương Hàn Phúc và Mạnh Thản,

01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.050
Bian Xi of Sishui,

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:08.470
All died under Guan Yunchang's blade

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.750
Can you guys tell me why?

01:09:14.100 --> 01:09:17.390
The four generals acted on orders to kill traitor Guan Yu

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.319
Orders? Following whose orders?

01:09:20.810 --> 01:09:24.660
I gave an oder, but that's to let him go.

01:09:24.779 --> 01:09:29.310
You guys don't understand, or want to object.

01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:37.050
My Lord, I gave the order.

01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:42.600
I gave the order...

01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:57.150
Why is everyone bowing?

01:09:57.450 --> 01:10:01.440
Perhaps they wanna betray me

01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:04.600
Sir, Tuần Do didnt meant to object your order

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.540
But Guan Yunchang is too powerful. Can't release the tiger back to its jungle

01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:11.210
You're bowing too, you wanna betray me too?

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:14.170
Sir, the battle's about to be fought. Please

01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:17.590
Only kill I, Tuần Do.

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:20.510
Only have to kill you right, right?

01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:29.600
Sir, his general crime doesnt deserve death

01:10:29.910 --> 01:10:32.770
Better have others let you down, dont let down others

01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:35.070
It was you that said so

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:40.460
What did I say?

01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:46.180
Better have others let you down, dont let down others

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.870
Right, I did say that

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:08.500
Stand up!

01:11:08.800 --> 01:11:12.160
You guys are right, I'm wrong

01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:26.690
Guan Yu said there's no love here, he's right

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.020
He's so right

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.170
Give me your hand!

01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:50.230
Can't control my men. 
How can you control a nation?

01:11:50.430 --> 01:11:54.400
Can't be control cause there's love here

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:57.080
Please, where's the court house?

01:12:59.530 --> 01:13:01.060
The court's closed

01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:04.140
I heard that the official here is a greedy official

01:13:04.290 --> 01:13:06.670
Even done things against the law

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:10.300
He drove away almost all the citizens in this city

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.700
You're mistaken

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:24.240
Because there's trouble here,

01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:26.610
Thats why they left

01:13:26.990 --> 01:13:30.330
I want to find that official, not you

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:32.010
It's the same thing

01:13:32.130 --> 01:13:34.280
Whats the relationship between you and him?

01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:36.250
I was his 'Vice Official'

01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:38.490
But last month I chopped him dead

01:13:38.680 --> 01:13:40.200
With his highness kindness,

01:13:40.630 --> 01:13:44.890
I, Wang Zhi, is now the official of Xingyang

01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:47.700
You're the one drove the citizens away

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.900
Allow me to ask, on your way here, killing men and generals

01:13:50.130 --> 01:13:53.740
Causing chaos, causing citizens trouble

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.120
Wang Zhi is here to stop you

01:13:56.600 --> 01:14:00.300
Cause I don't know anyone else to suffer

01:14:00.510 --> 01:14:01.920
You're a good official

01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780
Nevermind it!

01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:56.380
Sword skill is not bad!

01:14:57.210 --> 01:15:00.120
Sword skill's mediocre, it's the sword

01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.980
The sword is good, but your will is not strong

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:04.660
I know!

01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.840
Forget it! You're tired!

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.820
I'm not tired!

01:16:41.790 --> 01:16:44.510
Continue to fight and you'll lose your life, still wanna fight?

01:16:46.190 --> 01:16:49.310
Delaying you even just a little bit further

01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:51.210
Worths it.

01:16:51.490 --> 01:16:54.260
You believe that I, Guan Yu, would hurt the innocents?

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:57.960
These days, can't never tell

01:16:58.110 --> 01:16:59.570
Cao Cao said he'd let me go

01:17:00.010 --> 01:17:01.650
Then order to kill me

01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:03.860
Who's the unpredictable one?

01:17:03.990 --> 01:17:06.600
The law's been laid down

01:17:07.130 --> 01:17:10.590
If this Guan did wrongs, I will accepts my punishment

01:17:11.730 --> 01:17:12.800
Wang Zhi,

01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:14.940
Let me finish this task,

01:17:15.670 --> 01:17:17.140
I'll return to Xingyang

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.540
And take your punishment

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.980
You don't have to return cause your task won't be completed

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:36.410
The other day, a monk and a lady...

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.140
going toward Nhữ Dương...

01:17:38.330 --> 01:17:42.040
I myself lead them to Nam Dương road

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.770
invited them to Huỳnh Dương

01:17:44.970 --> 01:17:45.880
Where's that lady?

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:51.240
I've used swallow bird to report their location

01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:55.590
Go to Hứa Đô and surrender

01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:57.230
Must hurry!

01:17:58.120 --> 01:17:59.710
If not

01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:02.120
They will starve to death

01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:03.490
Where?

01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:07.610
Tell me, else I won't have mercy

01:18:07.770 --> 01:18:09.400
No need!

01:18:45.050 --> 01:18:45.850
It's your fault

01:18:46.090 --> 01:18:47.940
Lets go back

01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:37.920
I am Guan Yu

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:41.040
Looking for a lady with several monks

01:19:42.460 --> 01:19:44.190
Have you seen them?

01:19:44.350 --> 01:19:46.060
He killed General Wang

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.230
He killed General Wang

01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:49.490
Let me kid go!

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:51.040
Let me kid go!

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.820
- Devil...
- It's him...

01:19:52.980 --> 01:19:55.480
Let's kill him....

01:19:55.610 --> 01:20:00.610
Kill him to revenge General Wang

01:20:02.590 --> 01:20:04.290
Kill him...

01:20:04.430 --> 01:20:09.430
Kill him to revenge General Wang....

01:20:13.690 --> 01:20:18.570
Kill him...

01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:47.140
Wang Zhi doen't kill innocents

01:20:47.980 --> 01:20:51.420
We've found Lady Kỳ Lan outside the city

01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:54.110
Alright, we can go

01:22:10.470 --> 01:22:13.410
Open the gate!

01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:15.770
Stop...

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.250
Can't kill them

01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:21.010
They're all Wang Zhi's people

01:22:21.320 --> 01:22:22.920
No matter how much I ask they won't say

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:26.530
the location of Lady Kỳ Lan

01:22:26.690 --> 01:22:30.070
Only when General Cao arrived, they said it

01:22:30.990 --> 01:22:33.590
These people must die.

01:22:34.060 --> 01:22:36.120
General Guan,

01:22:36.340 --> 01:22:37.890
We can  let them live

01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:40.390
But if this gets out

01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.760
the lord would have a bad rep

01:22:42.910 --> 01:22:46.540
A bad rep for thousands of years

01:22:46.690 --> 01:22:48.130
Whoever dares I'll kill that person

01:22:48.720 --> 01:22:50.480
Looks llike you can't become a hero

01:22:50.640 --> 01:22:52.370
Just give up

01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.750
I said Whoever dares I'll kill that person

01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:03.660
Alright, General Guan doesn't want to kill

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:05.600
Then let them go

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:13.610
Everyone, if what happened today gets out

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:16.290
There's only one word

01:23:17.150 --> 01:23:20.350
Kill!

01:23:29.580 --> 01:23:31.440
Up to you

01:23:34.410 --> 01:23:35.440
Brother Yunchang

01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:39.350
You keep being the hero.

01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.490
Bad guy? Let me

01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:52.490
Luoyang was a hell hole

01:23:52.890 --> 01:23:54.820
But they saw daylight

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.840
Your deed was too big to be measure

01:23:58.020 --> 01:24:02.520
Unfortunately, outside of Luoyang is still hell hole

01:24:03.550 --> 01:24:07.450
But the hell that you speak of, is only a way to look at things

01:24:07.730 --> 01:24:10.320
Heaven or hell

01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.290
Is all up oneself

01:24:12.520 --> 01:24:15.360
I wish I can build a heaven

01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:17.930
But perhaps it's not my time

01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:23.670
Frankly, if thinking too far about anything

01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:27.300
Is like creating hell for yourself

01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:35.770
Wants me to think simple and not far ahead. Thats hard!

01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:40.620
There's heaven within hell and vice versa

01:24:40.830 --> 01:24:44.420
Please rethin carefully and then decide

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:48.930
Then I'll rethink about it

01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:55.350
The horses are fed. Thank you sir

01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:57.450
I wish to say goodbye

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:00.200
Thank you for pointing things out to me

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:02.980
Thank you

01:25:03.180 --> 01:25:04.020
Good bye!

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:16.240
Sit

01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:31.130
To you, am I heaven or hell?

01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:35.980
Heaven or hell all comes from what you think

01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.590
Back then, when you wanted to keep me

01:25:38.740 --> 01:25:41.010
You only need me to kill for you

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.280
How much must I kill for you?

01:25:45.460 --> 01:25:47.740
Guan Yu is a hero.

01:25:47.950 --> 01:25:51.570
Are there any heroes that doesn't kill in chaotic times like this

01:25:51.710 --> 01:25:53.530
How much must I kill?

01:25:55.170 --> 01:25:59.070
Yuan Shao has 20 thousands troop, kill 2 thousand

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.370
Then he will lose

01:26:01.570 --> 01:26:03.500
What about after Yuan Shao is defeated?

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.960
How would run put order to the world?

01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.700
Put Ru Ngủ Tôn at Giang Đông.

01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:12.710
Tây Lương troops will watch the seas

01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:13.910
Then what

01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.090
After that..

01:26:15.990 --> 01:26:19.560
Unify the whole country, take a few years off.

01:26:19.820 --> 01:26:22.420
I think...the world would be in peace

01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:24.140
Are you sure about that?

01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:25.650
Can't be.

01:26:25.870 --> 01:26:27.880
Human values are not enough

01:26:28.330 --> 01:26:30.530
You need laws

01:26:30.690 --> 01:26:31.990
But human to human,

01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:35.200
If there's no moral terms, where's can you find laws?

01:26:35.390 --> 01:26:38.310
In this world hatred keeps piling, wheres principle in that?

01:26:38.690 --> 01:26:40.780
Killing Yuan Shao's 2000 men,

01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:43.010
Isn't that piling up hatred?

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.960
That's the small price that must be pay

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:54.500
What if Guan Yu can kill Yuan Shao

01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:57.350
Great, that way,

01:26:57.550 --> 01:26:59.590
You saved 2000 people

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:01.030
Let me know, where is Yuan Shao?

01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:02.030
So you will help?

01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:03.000
I can't promise

01:27:04.140 --> 01:27:07.540
After Yuan Shao's killed, I want to live normally

01:27:10.710 --> 01:27:12.010
I don't believe you

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:15.370
A hero can never live a normal life

01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.410
After it's done, Liu Bei will not forgive you

01:27:18.630 --> 01:27:22.580
You stay and come back to Hứa Đô with me.

01:27:23.680 --> 01:27:27.180
Brother Liu can see through things, he's just.

01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:30.510
If it's must be, then he won't force it

01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:31.890
If we're talking

01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.400
bout me staying here, Guan Yu cannot comply

01:27:36.010 --> 01:27:39.440
I'll rather go home to tend stocks and grow crops

01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:42.040
So?

01:27:45.810 --> 01:27:48.500
Okay, I'll promise you.

01:27:52.900 --> 01:27:56.860
Sir, Guan Yu's really staying?

01:27:57.170 --> 01:28:01.130
You know why good horses doesn't eat regrown grass?

01:28:03.230 --> 01:28:05.370
Regrown grass's not as fresh

01:28:07.300 --> 01:28:08.100
right

01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:11.280
Liu Bei's time is up

01:28:11.650 --> 01:28:13.190
I, Cao Cao

01:28:13.890 --> 01:28:16.170
is still on my way up!

01:28:26.780 --> 01:28:27.580
Sister!

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:29.990
Ahead is Huang He River (Yellow River)

01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:35.420
Guan Yu wish to withdraw

01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:45.770
2nd brother...

01:28:46.230 --> 01:28:47.030
Sister...

01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:48.130
2nd brother....

01:28:49.490 --> 01:28:51.910
Thousand steps of goodbye, yet we still must part

01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:56.080
When you were hallucinating, I wasn't

01:28:56.370 --> 01:28:57.820
How you feel...

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.120
I, Kỳ Lan knows

01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:06.780
When I reach Nhữ Dương, I'll ask brother Liu

01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:08.510
to be married to you

01:29:10.210 --> 01:29:11.010
Nonsense!

01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:14.800
Sister, you're of Liu household, how can you say that?

01:29:15.790 --> 01:29:17.910
Today, I, Kỳ Lan,  willingly wants to marry Guan Yu

01:29:18.430 --> 01:29:21.040
You risked your life for Kỳ Lan on this journy

01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:23.290
Kỳ Lan seen it clearly

01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.340
Back then, you had to murder for me, why didn't you let me know?

01:29:32.530 --> 01:29:33.410
Is it

01:29:34.360 --> 01:29:36.160
because you never loved me?

01:29:55.520 --> 01:29:57.310
If you do have feelings for me

01:29:58.330 --> 01:30:01.190
Liu Brother would give us his blessing

01:30:01.700 --> 01:30:04.310
- Come back with me.
- What if I don't go back?

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.610
Would you still love me?

01:30:10.970 --> 01:30:12.180
Goodbye!

01:30:16.880 --> 01:30:18.490
You cannot work for Cao Cao

01:30:25.590 --> 01:30:26.520
Put it down!

01:30:26.750 --> 01:30:28.440
You betray Liu Brother

01:30:28.590 --> 01:30:30.180
just because one girl doesn't love you?

01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.360
Guan Yu never thought of that

01:30:31.530 --> 01:30:33.780
Only when Brother Liu's on the throne, the country can be united

01:30:33.950 --> 01:30:36.510
If Cao Cao's in control, there'd be more chaos

01:30:38.630 --> 01:30:41.050
I only want to good deeds for the people

01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:09.570
Must I, Guan Yu, be dead?

01:31:17.830 --> 01:31:20.150
Looks like Guan Yu have to die!

01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:39.240
Sister, please tell Big Brother Liu,

01:31:39.480 --> 01:31:41.770
Guan Yu is dead.

01:31:42.750 --> 01:31:44.470
I'm sorry

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:49.570
You have no fault in this

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.180
Worry not sister-in-law

01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:55.760
Guan Yu will never wrong brother Liu

01:31:59.810 --> 01:32:00.610
Take care!

01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:07.160
Sir, want me to go check on things?

01:32:10.370 --> 01:32:13.610
Let it be, heroes cannot get past beauty

01:32:13.870 --> 01:32:15.460
No rush!

01:32:25.190 --> 01:32:26.410
Protect the lord

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.020
Who ordered you?

01:33:19.630 --> 01:33:21.240
Who?

01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:23.590
Chop him!

01:33:33.510 --> 01:33:36.080
Where are they?

01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.640
It was my order!

01:35:11.370 --> 01:35:12.930
Letting Guan Yunchang go back...

01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:14.950
The world will be in turmoil

01:35:33.230 --> 01:35:35.400
You think I dare not kill him?

01:35:45.200 --> 01:35:47.720
Then you be sure to kill him

01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.110
If not from today on

01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:54.250
The world will surely be in turmoil

01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:56.900
Okay!

01:35:57.930 --> 01:35:59.480
I'l be sure to kill him

01:36:10.740 --> 01:36:12.610
Your highness, lets go

01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.310
You can't leave

01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:47.960
You must have to kill Guan Yu?

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:51.260
Can't object the king

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.260
Can't object the king?

01:36:55.470 --> 01:36:57.280
Can't object the king?

01:36:57.880 --> 01:36:59.690
You no longer wish to live?

01:37:00.130 --> 01:37:02.950
My life's been lost a long time ago

01:37:06.350 --> 01:37:07.660
You're the same

01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:30.530
Brother Guan, don't force me

01:37:31.210 --> 01:37:34.690
Get lost! I'll kill whoever's in my way

01:37:34.880 --> 01:37:37.840
I'll chop whoever touches Guan Yunchang

01:37:38.640 --> 01:37:41.400
Brother Yunchang, don't fight anymore

01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:43.930
This scoundrel is not worth it

01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:45.810
Can't object the king? I despise it

01:37:45.980 --> 01:37:47.730
I'll chop you dead

01:37:48.010 --> 01:37:49.110
Stop!

01:37:50.010 --> 01:37:52.440
I am of the heaven's, you can't kill me

01:37:52.610 --> 01:37:54.210
You're of the heaven's? I'll bring justice in the name of heaven

01:37:54.370 --> 01:37:55.910
Guan Yunchang

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:59.230
The king cannot be killed

01:37:59.560 --> 01:38:00.730
If the king is dead

01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:03.980
Everyone'll have a reason to rebel

01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:06.700
Then even more will die

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:08.190
Do you not understand this?

01:38:08.960 --> 01:38:10.160
Because of a woman,

01:38:10.460 --> 01:38:11.810
A woman that doesn't love you,

01:38:12.280 --> 01:38:13.700
You turn your back on the world?

01:38:15.400 --> 01:38:17.130
She is your sister-in-law

01:38:17.370 --> 01:38:18.610
Another man's lady

01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:20.840
There's nothing for you, even if she's alive

01:38:25.740 --> 01:38:28.660
I promise, when the country's at peace

01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:31.350
I myself will kill this scoundrel

01:38:35.460 --> 01:38:39.420
I, Cao Mengde, said it and will do it

01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:04.950
Cao Cao

01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:08.170
This kingdom...

01:39:09.210 --> 01:39:10.780
You cannot bring it to peace

01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:18.090
Sister...

01:40:19.570 --> 01:40:20.860
Let us go.

01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:56.820
Today I want the world to know 

01:41:57.030 --> 01:42:02.030
It was the other wolves that killed Guan Yu

01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.550
You're speaking of Sun Quan?

01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:14.740
Sun Quan, is just one

01:42:15.510 --> 01:42:20.010
There's Liu Bei...Kong Ming also...

01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:22.810
I want the world to know,

01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:26.790
It's them that killed Guan Yu

01:42:30.610 --> 01:42:35.290
Looks like war is inevitable

01:42:35.530 --> 01:42:38.690
Of course, with Guan Yu gone.

01:42:38.940 --> 01:42:43.110
Shu - Wu, who wins who loses

01:42:43.730 --> 01:42:45.700
Cannot be said yet

01:42:46.220 --> 01:42:48.010
Even when someone's dead

01:42:48.670 --> 01:42:51.060
Sir Cao can still uses him

01:42:59.060 --> 01:43:03.430
I never said I was a sheep!

01:43:04.305 --> 01:43:10.665
