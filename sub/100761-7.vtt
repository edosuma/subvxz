WEBVTT

00:39.540 --> 00:40.958
Mate.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.463
-What's going on?
-Been running.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.966
-What? Why? What's happened?
-Nothing. Just been running.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.386
-I don't understand. Someone chasing you?
-No. No one's chasing me.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.263
I've just been for a run. People run.

00:55.430 --> 00:56.557
Okay.

00:57.599 --> 01:00.894
Went to the corner shop and back.

01:00.978 --> 01:03.146
-Our corner shop?
-Oh, yeah.

01:03.230 --> 01:05.566
-On Ellerslie Road?
-Yeah. Why?

01:05.649 --> 01:06.984
No, no, no reason.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.819
Measured the distance, exactly a mile.

01:09.570 --> 01:12.030
So... beat my personal best.

01:12.114 --> 01:13.323
What's your personal best?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.867
Half a mile.

01:16.869 --> 01:20.706
I think it's difficult for me to shift
weight on account of my head being so big.

01:20.789 --> 01:22.833
-Head's half a stone.
-Half a stone?

01:22.916 --> 01:24.585
Look, it's extremely big.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.173
Oh, yeah. That is pretty big.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.175
Oh, yeah.

02:09.128 --> 02:12.466
I said, "Next time you tell someone
you're taking their kids off them,

02:12.549 --> 02:13.383
do it with respect.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.512
You put on a shirt
and some smart shoes with laces."

02:16.595 --> 02:18.805
-I'm not having it, not on my team.
-You're such a badass.

02:20.307 --> 02:23.435
Excuse me. Sorry, could I trouble you
for a glass of water?

02:23.519 --> 02:25.062
Oh, sorry. I don't work here.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.147
No, I know, but it's just over there.

02:28.398 --> 02:29.691
Okay.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.237
-So, how are we doing with the family map?
-Oh, yeah.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.535
-Here you go.
-Lovely. Thanks so much.

02:39.618 --> 02:40.744
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.623
Goody. Lovely. Good old family map.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.959
You'll need this lot.
These are your troops.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.837
Adoption panels love
a strong family network.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.673
And this lot? They a good bunch?
Supportive?

02:53.298 --> 02:55.259
Or is it a tramadol-
to-get-through-Christmas situation?

02:55.342 --> 02:57.886
Oh, no. They're great.

02:57.970 --> 03:00.180
We couldn't have wished
for a more supportive family.

03:00.639 --> 03:04.101
-And how's Jason?
-Yeah, he's great. He's perfect.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.813
He's working today,
which is why he couldn't, you know--

03:07.896 --> 03:09.731
Yeah, totally perfect.

03:12.442 --> 03:14.736
It's rare to get through this process
without some bumps.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.281
You know, some doubts, some tension.

03:17.364 --> 03:20.200
Honestly, it's all good. It's all good.

03:20.284 --> 03:21.702
-It's all perfect.
-Perfect.

03:22.369 --> 03:23.495
Yeah, exactly.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.791
Right, bear with me. Nature calls.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.961
Christ, it is like running a bath
with the bloody plug out.

03:58.822 --> 03:59.823
Occupied.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.585
-Penny, I can't use them.
-What have I told you?

04:11.668 --> 04:15.297
Yeah, I know. I just-- I thought
it might count against us if we got,

04:15.380 --> 04:17.089
I don't know, an Asian child or--

04:17.173 --> 04:18.591
Okay, I tell you what...

04:21.345 --> 04:24.014
let's call this whole session
off the record.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.810
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

04:28.894 --> 04:29.895
Could we get a fork?

04:31.939 --> 04:33.315
Sure.

04:34.942 --> 04:35.984
She's nice.

04:42.616 --> 04:45.994
A party? With both of our families?
Are you out of your mind?

04:46.078 --> 04:47.621
Penny thought it might help.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.458
-I just think it's a bad idea.
-Yes, again, noted.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.963
We've got a week till panel, and I've said
our family are a great support network.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.840
So basically we've got a week
to make them into one.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.758
Can't we just lie? Say we've done it.
I mean, no one's gonna--

04:59.842 --> 05:02.010
Jason. This stuff matters.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.138
We're not gonna be able to do all this
on our own.

05:05.222 --> 05:06.557
We're gonna need their help.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.478
-Plus, Erica agrees with me, so...
-Erica doesn't know 'em.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.897
Yeah, well, I think she's got
an idealized view of families

05:13.981 --> 05:16.066
-'cause both her parents are dead.
-Well, sorry about that.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.653
But both of our parents are still alive.
And in many ways that's much harder.

05:33.876 --> 05:35.586
Mom, would you like some more?

05:36.753 --> 05:39.047
Thanks. Oh, that's-- Okay, thanks.

05:39.131 --> 05:40.465
Sandra, would you like a top-up?

05:45.179 --> 05:47.306
-Go and talk to Mum, please.
-Why?

05:47.389 --> 05:50.350
Because it's really quiet.
It's not going how I hoped.

05:50.434 --> 05:51.685
It's fine. It's going well.

05:51.768 --> 05:55.022
No. Karen, there's no flow.
Parties, they have to have flow.

05:55.105 --> 05:56.440
Oh, it's a party?

05:59.151 --> 06:01.361
Oh, okay then.
No, no, it's not going well.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.030
Karen, will you just go and talk to her?

06:03.113 --> 06:05.073
I am a 38-year-old woman with no children.

06:05.157 --> 06:07.034
I have got nothing
to talk to my parents about.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.952
Please. For me.

06:09.703 --> 06:10.871
Fine.

06:11.830 --> 06:12.915
I'm taking this though.

06:13.957 --> 06:17.544
And at the end of all of it,
you're getting a very troubled child.

06:18.212 --> 06:21.924
Seems like a lot of hoops to jump through
to get something that's already damaged.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.217
I don't think that's quite fair.

06:23.300 --> 06:26.470
There are certain things
you don't get secondhand.

06:27.346 --> 06:30.724
Underwear, bed linen, children.

06:31.683 --> 06:34.937
I'm sorry if that sounds harsh.
I just tell it like it is.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.855
-You gonna take the job?
-Oh, I don't know.

06:36.939 --> 06:39.733
No, I don't think so.
I'm a teacher. I'm not a manager.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.151
Yeah, yeah.

06:41.235 --> 06:44.863
Well, listen, you know, I have
a little saying for decisions like this.

06:45.948 --> 06:47.324
"Follow your heart."

06:51.370 --> 06:53.497
What line of work
are you looking to get into, Scott?

06:53.580 --> 06:56.416
Right. I used to work in finance.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.296
I think, at root, I'm a storyteller.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.715
Right.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.850
-Are you okay?
-Yeah. No, yeah. I'm fine.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.645
I just want everyone to get along.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.438
Will you go and speak to Jason's dad?

07:18.522 --> 07:20.649
He's just reading his iPad.
He's not really engaging.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.609
Yeah, okay. Where is he?

07:35.289 --> 07:37.416
Vic, what are you doing?

07:37.499 --> 07:39.960
Well, there's no point in being here
if I'm not gonna be useful.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.795
There are other reasons to be here.

07:41.879 --> 07:44.173
Like spending time with your family.
Come on.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.885
I can fix that lock as well, if--

07:47.968 --> 07:49.386
No, come on. Down--

07:49.469 --> 07:50.804
Actually...

07:52.639 --> 07:54.057
No, come on. Downstairs.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.519
-All right.
-You take a seat over there, Vic.

07:57.603 --> 07:59.104
I'll go grab you a drink.

08:05.569 --> 08:07.529
What did you do for tea last night?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.241
Lasagna.

08:12.159 --> 08:13.285
Just lasagna?

08:14.411 --> 08:15.454
And salad.

08:18.040 --> 08:19.124
That's nice.

08:21.335 --> 08:23.337
-And you?
-Sausages.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.380
What, just sausages?

08:26.215 --> 08:27.299
And a bit of mash.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.093
Cool.

08:35.265 --> 08:36.265
There we are.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.684
I know a fellow tech-head when I see one.

08:39.645 --> 08:41.104
-It's Vic, isn't it?
-Yes.

08:41.188 --> 08:45.317
-Has Scott had any luck work-wise?
-No.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.444
Oh, what are we up to?

08:47.528 --> 08:52.950
I just want him to find something before
all of his self-confidence drains away.

08:53.575 --> 08:56.036
It's small talk, isn't it?
That's the hard-- That's the icebreaker.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.831
That's the hard thing, I think,
is just to sort of come in, as I did then,

08:59.915 --> 09:02.626
-and break the proverbial ice.
-I think we've got a while.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.128
It's just-- It's small talk.
It's language.

09:05.212 --> 09:07.923
And we talk a lot about
the contingency of language, don't we?

09:08.006 --> 09:11.635
But, for me, the real wolf at the door,
subjectivity-wise,

09:11.718 --> 09:14.221
and apologies to Rousseau for saying this,

09:14.304 --> 09:16.181
but none of us self-create.

09:16.682 --> 09:20.018
Although I do feel very historically
contingent. I don't know if you do.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.544
All right. Go and have a drink
with my dad.

09:46.253 --> 09:47.629
That's much better.

09:52.843 --> 09:54.136
Okay.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.387
Good.

09:58.182 --> 09:59.349
Good.

10:00.434 --> 10:02.603
This is your dad's. Can you hide it?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.563
-I want him to talk to people.
-Why?

10:04.646 --> 10:06.440
Because we need to be able
to walk into that panel and say,

10:06.523 --> 10:09.234
"Yes, our family
are supportive and engaged."

10:09.318 --> 10:12.529
-That's not really his sort of thing.
-Don't know how your mum does it.

10:12.613 --> 10:14.656
How can anyone be with someone
that unavailable?

10:17.159 --> 10:19.536
-Jason.
-Yes, sorry. Go on.

10:22.915 --> 10:25.918
I've got to go to the shop
and get some posh wine for your mum.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.461
She's doing her face again.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.588
Have you got 8 quid?

10:36.595 --> 10:39.765
Can't believe it's still light.
I sort of thought it would be dark by now.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.767
-We've only been in there two hours.
-Yeah.

10:41.850 --> 10:44.728
Two hours with Jason's mum
feels like a week with anyone normal.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.812
Oh, yeah.

10:48.190 --> 10:49.858
-Hey, you really okay?
-Yeah, why?

10:51.026 --> 10:52.903
You just seem a bit on edge.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.783
Something's going on with Jason.
I don't really know what.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.284
-The training thing?
-Yeah.

11:00.410 --> 11:01.537
Also...

11:02.371 --> 11:03.413
What?

11:04.456 --> 11:08.669
I saw a text he got
from this woman called Sofia.

11:08.752 --> 11:11.630
We don't know anyone called Sofia.

11:19.096 --> 11:20.597
So, what did it say?

11:21.431 --> 11:22.933
"We should do that again soon."

11:23.892 --> 11:25.394
And then two kisses at the bottom.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.603
Right.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.691
-Still, though, Jason...
-Also, he's running. He never runs.

11:31.692 --> 11:34.444
So I'm thinking,
who is he getting in shape for?

11:35.612 --> 11:37.489
No, look. I'm sure it's completely fine.

11:37.573 --> 11:39.616
You're probably just thinking
the worst because,

11:39.700 --> 11:41.702
you know, that's how you two got together.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.503
And chili in everything.

11:53.255 --> 11:54.506
I mean, in an omelet?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.468
They'll be putting samosas
in a full English breakfast next.

11:58.552 --> 12:01.221
One thing I will say is,
for the multiculturalism,

12:01.305 --> 12:03.348
if you do want a plumber at Christmas...

12:04.600 --> 12:06.518
I'll bet they charge you the earth,
do they, at Christmas?

12:06.602 --> 12:09.479
Obviously, your own child is preferable.

12:10.480 --> 12:13.025
-They did try.
-Oh, God, yeah.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.527
I'd think to myself,
"Christ, they're still trying."

12:16.111 --> 12:18.197
They had to give it a shot.

12:18.280 --> 12:21.158
But it is very modern, isn't it?
To try and change things?

12:21.825 --> 12:23.493
I think for our generation,

12:23.577 --> 12:25.913
if you couldn't do something,
you just did something else.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.748
There are more options now.

12:27.831 --> 12:29.333
But is that good?

12:29.416 --> 12:30.709
I don't know.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.837
We saw what it did to Nikki, emotionally.

12:33.921 --> 12:35.547
I mean, you know what she's like.

12:40.302 --> 12:41.929
Would you like to try this wine, Sandra?

12:54.525 --> 12:55.651
There you go.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.119
It's worse.

13:15.546 --> 13:20.050
The real question is,
is it even moral to have a baby? You know?

13:20.133 --> 13:25.013
Just to rip it out of nonexistence
into a dying world?

13:26.473 --> 13:29.601
Scott, would you mind
taking some ice through to Sandra?

13:30.602 --> 13:31.895
Yeah, sure. Where is it?

13:31.979 --> 13:33.105
Where's what?

13:33.188 --> 13:34.189
The ice.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.359
-Where's the ice?
-Yeah.

13:38.068 --> 13:39.236
Well, it's in the freezer.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.948
Right. Yeah.
Yeah, I was thinking probably freezer.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.116
Okay.

13:46.910 --> 13:47.953
What?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.171
But, you know, that's the way
the world looks at it.

13:57.754 --> 14:01.091
Yeah. If you don't have competition,
you never get any better, do ya?

14:02.134 --> 14:03.719
If you want the family to get along,
he's part of the family, all right?

14:03.802 --> 14:05.596
I'm sorry, I just don't get it.

14:05.679 --> 14:09.349
She doesn't even want kids.
She's got time to find someone proper.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.185
Do you know he claims
he's never heard of Beyoncé?

14:11.268 --> 14:14.646
Beyoncé. I mean,
why would you even boast about that?

14:14.730 --> 14:16.857
Yeah, yeah.
Well, we invented cricket, didn't we?

14:16.940 --> 14:18.734
And now we go over there,
they hammer us.

14:19.902 --> 14:23.572
-I think our dads are bonding over racism.
-At this point, I'm glad they're talking.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.992
The thing is,
you walk down the street...

14:27.075 --> 14:28.118
What?

14:29.620 --> 14:30.454
Jase.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.373
Nikki.
Can I just have a word, please?

14:33.457 --> 14:36.502
-Can I come and find you in a bit?
-No, it's all right. You carry on.

14:36.585 --> 14:38.086
I'm gonna go and break up
the English Defence League

14:38.170 --> 14:39.796
before they start printing pamphlets.

14:44.468 --> 14:45.469
What's up?

14:45.928 --> 14:48.764
I think that we should just
take it outside. Yeah?

14:55.062 --> 14:57.606
-All right. What's the matter?
-You got something to say about Scott?

14:57.689 --> 14:59.441
What? No. What do you mean?

14:59.525 --> 15:01.235
I just get the sense
you're not happy for me.

15:01.318 --> 15:05.364
Why? I think it's great.
I'm glad that you found someone.

15:05.447 --> 15:07.491
Just tell me what you think of him.

15:07.574 --> 15:10.452
Well, I-- Yeah, I like him.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.871
-Nikki.
-I do.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.791
You are so full of shit.

15:15.874 --> 15:17.543
Oh, my God.
What do you want me to say?

15:17.626 --> 15:19.044
I want you to tell me the truth.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.381
I want you to stop being so bloody nice.

15:24.341 --> 15:28.512
It is not nice to be so nice all the time.
It is oppressive.

15:30.556 --> 15:33.267
Fine. Fine, I don't like him.

15:33.350 --> 15:36.520
Look, I'm sure I'll come to like him.
But currently, I'm sorry, I do not.

15:37.104 --> 15:38.272
I knew it.

15:39.314 --> 15:42.484
You just hate that I am getting
my shit together, don't you?

15:42.568 --> 15:44.695
Oh, my God. Why would I hate that?

15:44.778 --> 15:46.947
-'Cause you're insecure.
-Oh, wow. I'm insecure.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.908
You're the one marrying a man
you barely like just for the company.

15:50.367 --> 15:51.618
I am happy.

15:51.702 --> 15:55.789
Please. If you were so happy about this,
you wouldn't need me to be.

15:56.331 --> 15:58.792
You do not know him.

15:59.293 --> 16:01.753
I know him enough to know
he's not good enough for you.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.382
Karen-- Karen!

16:06.717 --> 16:09.469
-You know, it's not like I'm the only one.
-Oh, really?

16:09.553 --> 16:10.554
-Yes. Yeah.
-Right. Right.

16:10.637 --> 16:11.722
More drama.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.141
Okay. Well, let's just see
what everyone else thinks then, shall we?

16:14.224 --> 16:16.476
No. No, don't tell her. It's a trick.
She doesn't really wanna know.

16:16.560 --> 16:19.646
-She says she does, but she doesn't.
-Hang on. Hang on. What's going on here?

16:19.730 --> 16:21.940
Nikki's just getting herself
all worked up.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.318
-This is what I'm talking about.
-What did she say?

16:24.401 --> 16:25.360
-Why is she always criticizing me?
-Pipe down, Mum.

16:25.444 --> 16:27.070
She's not always criticizing. Are you?

16:27.154 --> 16:28.197
I just tell it like it is.

16:28.280 --> 16:31.033
You ever notice no one says anything nice
after that though?

16:31.116 --> 16:35.287
I mean, no one ever says, "I tell it
like it is. Them glasses really suit you."

16:35.370 --> 16:38.790
He speaks. How long have you been
plucking up courage to say that, John?

16:38.874 --> 16:41.835
-Mum!
-Well, he's a slow puncture, that one.

16:41.919 --> 16:44.796
-It's called being nice.
-The cavalry's arrived.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.299
At least she's being honest, not like us.

16:47.382 --> 16:48.967
It's not always good to be honest, Karen.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.678
-Right. So, you don't like him either?
-Who's that?

16:51.762 --> 16:54.139
-We didn't say that.
-Not to his face.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.391
Everyone just calm down. Please.

16:56.475 --> 16:58.769
We're supposed to be a family,
not West Side bloody Story.

16:58.852 --> 17:01.230
I don't think you, of all people,
should be lecturing anyone.

17:01.313 --> 17:02.314
-Erica.
-What?

17:02.397 --> 17:04.023
I think we've all just had
a bit too much to drink.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.151
I wish. Have you tasted this?

17:06.234 --> 17:10.571
Oh, my God. Sandra, I am sorry
that you don't like any of the wine.

17:10.656 --> 17:12.491
Do you know what? There's some rum
and raisin cake in the fridge.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.284
Why don't you just suck
the alcohol out of that?

17:14.992 --> 17:18.247
Yeah. You know, I actually find
that conflict can be quite useful.

17:18.329 --> 17:20.290
-Sit down, mate. Keep out of it.
-Just shut up, Scott.

17:24.837 --> 17:25.838
Yeah, lovely.

17:52.489 --> 17:54.032
I think it's going very well.

18:01.290 --> 18:02.583
I think we need to talk.

18:06.670 --> 18:12.467
Our families are useless,
so clearly all we have is each other.

18:12.551 --> 18:14.595
So we just need to be totally honest.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.515
Yeah. Okay.

18:20.475 --> 18:22.936
It feels like there's something going on.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.106
And I didn't wanna believe it.
But then I spoke to Erica, and--

18:26.190 --> 18:29.193
She's just-- She's made me think.

18:35.324 --> 18:36.742
Is there another woman?

18:41.705 --> 18:43.832
-There is?
-Yeah.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.629
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

18:56.386 --> 18:58.764
-How long has it been going on?
-Quite a while.

18:59.348 --> 19:01.391
How could you lie to me? This is us.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.352
-This is you and me.
-I know. I just thought

19:03.435 --> 19:07.105
that if it ended before anyone
could find out, then it would just--

19:07.189 --> 19:09.441
It would be a mistake and everything
would just go back to normal.

19:09.525 --> 19:12.027
No. Things don't go back to normal
after something like this, Jason.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.862
-You know that.
-I know. I know.

19:13.946 --> 19:15.072
-Bastard!
-But, look.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.366
Things haven't been right
for a while, okay?

19:17.449 --> 19:20.452
And I think if we're being honest,
there's probably blame on both sides.

19:20.536 --> 19:24.039
No. No. No, Jason.
There is blame on one side.

19:24.122 --> 19:25.457
When something like this happens,

19:25.541 --> 19:29.711
it is usually a big sign there is
something very wrong in the relationship.

19:29.795 --> 19:30.879
Oh, my God.

19:32.422 --> 19:33.423
I know.

19:39.471 --> 19:40.722
So, that's it then?

19:44.017 --> 19:47.563
-It's over?
-Honestly, I don't know.

19:48.105 --> 19:49.898
I don't know.

19:49.982 --> 19:54.903
But what I hope, right,
what I genuinely hope

19:54.987 --> 19:57.155
-is that we can all stay friends.
-What?

19:57.239 --> 19:59.157
-The three of us.
-Are you insane?

19:59.241 --> 20:02.494
-I know it will be awkward at first--
-Why would I ever want to do that?

20:02.578 --> 20:04.329
Because there's
a whole shared history between us.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.165
-What?
-Look, he's important to me, all right?

20:07.249 --> 20:08.750
-They both are.
-Who are?

20:08.834 --> 20:11.295
-Erica and Freddy.
-What's it got to do with them?

20:11.378 --> 20:12.963
-What do you mean?
-What?

20:13.046 --> 20:14.965
-What?
-Sorry, what are we talking about?

20:15.048 --> 20:16.425
Freddy's affair.
What are you talking about?

20:16.508 --> 20:19.303
-I'm talking about your affair.
-My affair? I'm not having an affair!

20:19.386 --> 20:20.512
-What?
-What?

20:23.098 --> 20:25.475
-Freddy had the affair?
-Yes!

20:26.435 --> 20:28.729
Wha-- Then, who's Sofia?

20:28.812 --> 20:30.939
-Who?
-Sofia, Jason. Who's Sofia?

20:31.023 --> 20:32.482
Some girl at the language school.
What's she gotta do with it?

20:32.566 --> 20:35.444
-Why has she been messaging you?
-She-- Have you been reading my texts?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.237
"We should do that again soon.
Kiss, kiss."

20:37.321 --> 20:39.406
My God, I've been giving her
some extra tuition, all right?

20:39.489 --> 20:42.534
Right. And you only tutor
cute girls called Sofia?

20:42.618 --> 20:44.786
She asked for my help,
so I gave her some help.

20:44.870 --> 20:47.414
-Isn't that what this is all about, Nikki?
-Out of the goodness of your heart?

20:47.497 --> 20:50.501
Yeah, 'cause I'm not an arsehole
or a child. Remember that?

20:50.584 --> 20:54.463
Well, what about the gym?
And all your running?

20:54.546 --> 20:57.132
Fine. Fine! I--

20:58.258 --> 20:59.468
The--

20:59.551 --> 21:01.887
My medical's come through
much sooner than I imagined,

21:01.970 --> 21:04.181
and I've not been sticking
to my regime at all!

21:05.724 --> 21:08.143
-I've been smoking.
-Yeah, no. I know you have.

21:08.227 --> 21:11.021
-I smell it on your clothes.
-And I just--

21:12.814 --> 21:13.815
I've let you down.

21:14.775 --> 21:16.443
And this could really mess things up.

21:16.527 --> 21:20.781
And I've been running and doing everything
I can to try and make it better.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.037
What are you laughing at?

21:28.497 --> 21:30.374
-Jason.
-Yes?

21:31.750 --> 21:32.751
You can't...

21:33.418 --> 21:36.630
You can't cram for a medical.
It's not a GCSE.

21:36.713 --> 21:37.923
I know now.

21:39.550 --> 21:41.051
Come here.

21:42.511 --> 21:44.555
Not having a bloody affair.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.476
Wait. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

21:49.560 --> 21:50.936
Freddy's having an affair?

21:51.812 --> 21:53.689
-I feel like we've been through this.
-But does Erica know?

21:55.482 --> 21:56.775
-No.
-Bastard!

21:56.859 --> 21:57.734
Where are you going?

21:57.818 --> 22:00.028
I've got a lot of anger
that I was gonna use on you

22:00.112 --> 22:01.488
that I now need to get rid of.

22:07.703 --> 22:09.288
-Hey. Got any more of those--
-I want a word with you.

22:09.997 --> 22:11.331
Wait. Why are you pushing me?

22:11.415 --> 22:13.000
-Hey. All right.
-Get in there.

22:13.917 --> 22:14.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.840
-What are you doing?
-Now, you listen to me.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.342
Do you know who future Freddy is
without Erica?

22:22.426 --> 22:23.635
-What?
-I'll tell you who he is.

22:23.719 --> 22:26.805
He's a creepy old man in a bad suit
soaked in Paco Rabanne,

22:26.889 --> 22:29.892
begging women who, by the way,
are only talking to him ironically,

22:29.975 --> 22:33.061
to come back to his sad, lonely,
little apartment his children never visit.

22:33.979 --> 22:35.647
This is your last warning.

22:36.190 --> 22:37.357
End it.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.525
I just-- Look.

22:38.901 --> 22:42.738
Okay, I just-- I will. I just need to find
the right way and the right time.

22:42.821 --> 22:44.740
The right way is with your mouth.

22:44.823 --> 22:47.409
And the right time is now. Okay?

22:47.492 --> 22:51.079
And if you ever do anything like this
to my friend again, I will come for you,

22:51.163 --> 22:54.625
and I will pop your head off your body
like a bloody champagne cork. Understand?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.211
Yes, yes. Please, just don't tell Erica.

22:59.171 --> 23:00.297
Please.

23:20.651 --> 23:21.860
What's the matter? You all right?

23:23.862 --> 23:26.490
-You made him cry?
-Oh, please. He's crying for himself.

23:27.032 --> 23:28.158
Like OJ.

23:31.078 --> 23:32.704
So, this is our support network?

23:32.788 --> 23:34.998
-Yeah.
-I heard what she said.

23:35.082 --> 23:38.377
Tell you what though.
Everyone's still here.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.587
-That supposed to cheer me up?
-Well, it's a shit party, innit?

23:40.671 --> 23:42.339
No one here gets along,
and no one's having fun.

23:42.422 --> 23:44.800
-Jason, that isn't really--
-But no one's left.

23:47.302 --> 23:48.887
We want people that we can rely on.

23:48.971 --> 23:51.098
-I am not sensitive.
-You are.

23:51.181 --> 23:52.891
And who else would still be here?

23:52.975 --> 23:56.061
-Well, sometimes you are.
-I am not!

23:57.312 --> 24:00.524
Guys. Say if not.
Any chance I could have a quick bath?

24:03.402 --> 24:05.404
Just, you need to kinda--
You need to shift your body over.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.906
I've shifted my body over as far as I can.

24:07.990 --> 24:09.658
-Yeah, drop your head onto it.
-I'm not gonna drop it on it.

24:09.741 --> 24:10.993
-It'll hurt, won't it?
-Drop your head onto it.

24:11.076 --> 24:13.287
-I'm gonna place it on nice and gently.
-Okay.

24:13.370 --> 24:14.997
Now, what's the reading?
What's the reading?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.916
Well, you've gone up.
You're a stone and a half.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.669
-Stone and a half?
-Yeah.

24:20.752 --> 24:22.171
You see. Massive.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.719
Are we okay?

24:30.804 --> 24:31.638
Yeah.

24:32.389 --> 24:33.807
'Cause I meant what I said.

24:34.808 --> 24:35.893
I need you with me.

24:37.561 --> 24:41.064
I don't wanna turn into Erica and Freddy
and their terrible, perfect lives.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.149
Well, we won't.

24:46.445 --> 24:48.363
I was frightened, you know.

24:51.074 --> 24:52.534
-Are you frightened now?
-No.

24:54.036 --> 24:55.287
No, I'm not.

24:59.750 --> 25:01.668
I don't wanna be the Paco Rabanne guy.

25:05.839 --> 25:07.925
We've got the adoption panel coming up.

25:08.008 --> 25:10.928
And we have to convince other people
that we're a perfect couple.

25:12.554 --> 25:13.680
Well, we will.

25:15.474 --> 25:17.142
I'm just gonna tell them the truth.

25:19.478 --> 25:22.689
That I can't imagine
ever being apart from you.

25:26.151 --> 25:31.198
Because I'm trapped in the orbit
of your stupid, fat head.

25:36.370 --> 25:38.247
Stone and a half.

25:49.758 --> 25:51.468
-It's cold.
-You cold?

25:51.552 --> 25:52.553
Yeah.

25:54.096 --> 25:55.180
There we go.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.392
Gorgeous.
