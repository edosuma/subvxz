IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

00:02.603 --> 00:04.038
SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:04.072 --> 00:06.140
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:06.174 --> 00:08.576
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:08.609 --> 00:10.311
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:10.344 --> 00:11.679
ARE MEMBERS
OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:11.712 --> 00:13.314
KNOWN AS
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT.

00:13.347 --> 00:15.549
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:17.118 --> 00:20.088

THAT'S MY PERFECT BOY.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.289

00:21.322 --> 00:22.823

A WONDERFUL TEACHER, ROGER.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.159
DANNY LOVES YOUR CLASSES.

00:25.193 --> 00:26.460

GLAD TO HEAR IT.

00:26.494 --> 00:29.063
COME ON, SALLY.
TUCK YOUR HEAD.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.731
THAT'S IT.
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.200
COME ON, KEEP IT GOING
HERE WE GO, HERE WE GO.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.834
- HANNAH DOESN'T GIVE
A DAMN ABOUT YOUR CLASS.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.337
WHAT SHE REALLY WANTS
IS TO RIP YOUR SWEATS OFF

00:36.370 --> 00:38.239
AND STRADDLE YOU LIKE
A POMMEL HORSE.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.374
- I DON'T THINK--
- DON'T GIVE ME ANY OF THAT

00:40.408 --> 00:42.710
"I NEVER SLEEP
WITH MY CLIENTS" CRAP.

00:42.743 --> 00:44.212
- I DON'T.

00:44.245 --> 00:46.114
- YOU SHOULD.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.182
- VERA, LOOK,
I'M FLATTERED.

00:48.216 --> 00:50.084
IT'S JUST...

00:50.118 --> 00:52.253
YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TEE.

00:52.286 --> 00:54.155
- GOD.

00:54.188 --> 00:55.623
WOW, VERA, NICE GOING.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.726
- [baby crying]

00:58.759 --> 01:01.162
- OH, MY GOD.

01:01.195 --> 01:03.197
OH!

01:05.199 --> 01:07.701
YOU POOR BABY!
YOU MUST BE FREEZING.

01:07.735 --> 01:09.137
- [baby crying]

01:09.170 --> 01:12.140
- HELP!
SOMEONE CALL 9-1-1.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.207
[baby crying]

01:13.241 --> 01:16.210
- MALE INFANT, CAUCASIAN.

01:16.244 --> 01:18.112
CAME IN
SEVERELY HYPOTHERMIC.

01:18.146 --> 01:20.114
NO OBVIOUS SIGNS OF ABUSE.

01:20.148 --> 01:21.882
- LEFT OUT IN 30-DEGREE WEATHER?
THAT'S ABUSE.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.417
- OR ATTEMPTED MURDER.

01:23.451 --> 01:24.718
LITTLE GUY'S LUCKY
HE'S UNDER AN INCUBATOR

01:24.752 --> 01:25.719
AND NOT IN A COFFIN.

01:25.753 --> 01:26.854
- WHAT WAS HE WEARING
WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT IN?

01:26.887 --> 01:29.890
- JUST A ONESIE, WRAPPED
IN A COUPLE OF FLANNEL BLANKETS.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.192
WE SENT THEM
OVER TO YOUR CRIME LAB

01:31.225 --> 01:32.426
FOR EVIDENCE PROCESSING.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.195
- AND HE'S WHAT, DOC,
TWO MONTHS?

01:34.228 --> 01:36.464
- WELL, POSTERIOR FONTANELLE
IS ALMOST CLOSED,

01:36.497 --> 01:37.531
SO, YEAH,
THAT'S A GOOD ESTIMATE.

01:37.565 --> 01:40.268
- HOW LONG WILL HE NEED
TO STAY IN THIS INCUBATOR?

01:40.301 --> 01:41.335
- WE'RE WARMING
HIM UP SLOWLY.

01:41.369 --> 01:42.903
HIS CORE TEMP IS STILL LOW,

01:42.936 --> 01:44.705
SO HE'S NOT
OUT OF THE WOODS YET.

01:44.738 --> 01:47.675
- [sighs]

01:47.708 --> 01:49.510
WHY WOULD
SOMEONE DO THIS TO YOU?

02:03.957 --> 02:06.927
[suspenseful music]

02:06.960 --> 02:10.164
*

02:51.239 --> 02:52.473
- CANVASS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
TURNED UP NOTHING.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.208
NOBODY KNOWS ANYBODY
WITH A BOY THAT YOUNG.

02:54.242 --> 02:56.577
- MISSING PERSONS HASN'T HAD
A BABY REPORTED IN WEEKS.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.912
- SO EITHER MOMMY DOESN'T KNOW
THAT HER SON'S GONE...

02:58.946 --> 02:59.947
- OR SHE WAS THE ONE
WHO DUMPED HIM.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.649
- WELL, LAB'S
RUNNING HIS DNA.

03:01.682 --> 03:02.950
MAYBE WE'LL COME UP WITH
A FAMILIAL MATCH.

03:02.983 --> 03:04.918
THAT'S REALLY
ALL WE HAVE TO GO ON.

03:04.952 --> 03:05.986
- I'VE GOT
SOMETHING FOR YOU.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.455
YOU SEE THAT LOGO?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.290
THAT COMES FROM
A STORE CALLED BEBETIQUE,

03:09.323 --> 03:11.259
AN UPPER EAST SIDE
BABY STORE.

03:11.292 --> 03:12.460
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

03:12.493 --> 03:14.262
- MY NIECE REGISTERED THERE
FOR HER NEWBORN.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.465
A BLANKET I BOUGHT 'EM
COST ME TWO WEEKS OF OVERTIME.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.966
- WHAT WAS IT MADE OF, MINK?

03:18.999 --> 03:19.900
- ORGANIC COTTON.

03:19.933 --> 03:22.002
YOU JUST GOTTA CHECK OUT
THEIR PRICE TAGS.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.272
I'M TELLING YOU,
THAT BABY'S MOM'S GOT MONEY.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.807
- WHOA,
FIN WASN'T KIDDING.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.975
THESE PRICES
ARE OUTTA SIGHT.

03:28.008 --> 03:30.511
- LOT OF PARENTS WILL PAY
ANYTHING FOR PEACE OF MIND.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.312
- WELL, FOR FEW MORE BUCKS,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.680
THEY COULD
HIRE A SECURITY GUARD.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.682
- THIS PILLOW
IS EASIER ON YOUR BACK

03:34.715 --> 03:35.883
AND LITTLE INDIA RESTS

03:35.916 --> 03:37.685
MUCH MORE COMFORTABLY
WHILE SHE NURSES.

03:37.718 --> 03:39.287
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

03:39.320 --> 03:40.621
- HOW ARE YOU?
WE NEED HELP, TOO.

03:40.654 --> 03:42.490
- GETTING A HEAD START?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN SHOWING YET.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.592
- UH, PROFESSIONAL HELP.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.294
YOU SELL THAT?

03:46.327 --> 03:47.961
- IT'S ONE OF
OUR MOST POPULAR ITEMS.

03:47.995 --> 03:50.331
- WE ALSO HAVE A BABY
WHO NEARLY DIED LAST NIGHT.

03:50.364 --> 03:52.733
HE WAS WEARING
ONE OF YOUR ONESIES.

03:52.766 --> 03:53.901
- OH, MY GOD...

03:53.934 --> 03:56.870
- YOU SEEM TO KNOW THE NAMES
OF ALL YOUR CLIENTS' KIDS.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.872
YOU RECOGNIZE THIS BOY?

03:58.906 --> 04:00.708
- THAT'S JASPER,
DEDE ASTON'S BABY.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.376
- SHE SEEM BONDED
WITH JASPER?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.912
- COMPLETELY.
SHE ADORES HIM.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.347
IS JASPER OKAY?

04:06.380 --> 04:07.615
- YEAH, YEAH.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.049
BUT WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS
FOR DEDE.

04:09.082 --> 04:10.584
DO YOU HAVE HER ADDRESS?
- WELL, LET ME CHECK.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.586
SHE'S IN OUR
FREQUENT BUYERS CLUB.

04:12.620 --> 04:13.987
- HAVE YOU EVER MET THE FATHER?

04:14.021 --> 04:15.889
- THERE ISN'T ONE.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.957
DEDE ADOPTED JASPER.

04:16.990 --> 04:19.860
SHE'S AN OLDER MOTHER--
WANTED TO START A FAMILY.

04:19.893 --> 04:22.996
[printer hums]

04:23.030 --> 04:25.032
HER CELL PHONE, EMAIL,
AND ADDRESS.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.904
[knocking]

04:30.938 --> 04:32.440
- DEDE'S NOT HOME.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.674
- OR ANSWERING HER PHONE.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.009
- THE BABY STORE OWNER SAID
DEDE SEEMED LIKE A GOOD MOTHER.

04:36.043 --> 04:37.978
I'M BEGINNING TO THINK
SOMEONE ELSE TOOK JASPER,

04:38.011 --> 04:39.613
AND MOM'S IN TROUBLE
AS WELL.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.415
- SOMEONE TOOK JASPER?

04:43.050 --> 04:43.951
- YOU DEDE'S NEIGHBOR?

04:43.984 --> 04:45.986
- WADE FISK.
I RENT HER GARDEN APARTMENT.

04:46.019 --> 04:48.622
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?
- WE'RE LOOKING FOR DEDE.

04:48.656 --> 04:51.058
- HAVEN'T SEEN HER
IN A FEW DAYS, BUT...

04:51.091 --> 04:53.427
OH, NO.
- WHAT?

04:53.461 --> 04:56.063
- LAST NIGHT I HEARD
YELLS COMING FROM HER PLACE.

04:56.096 --> 04:56.930
- YOU CALLED 911?

04:56.964 --> 05:00.401
- I THOUGHT IT WAS...
YOU KNOW...SEX.

05:00.434 --> 05:02.035
[muted cries, yells]
- YOU HEAR THAT?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.937
IT'S SPANISH,
PROBABLY NOT DEDE.

05:03.971 --> 05:06.073
- AYUDA ME, AYUDA ME!

05:06.106 --> 05:07.841
- THAT'S DEFINITELY
A CRY FOR HELP.

05:07.875 --> 05:09.543
- DOOR'S UNLOCKED.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.944
- [crying continues]

05:10.978 --> 05:12.913
AYUDA ME, AYUDA ME!
- POLICE.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.114
- POR FAVOR!
[crying]

05:14.147 --> 05:15.483
- MISS.
- [crying]

05:15.516 --> 05:17.685
- MISS, HEY.
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.921
- THEY TOOK THE BABY!
- WHO TOOK THE BABY?

05:20.954 --> 05:23.824
- I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THE BABY'S GONE.

05:23.857 --> 05:25.092
- STAND UP.
WHO ARE YOU?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.395
- I'M IMELDA.
I'M JASPER'S NANNY.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.996
I TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.665
MISS DEDE'S OUT ON BUSINESS
IN BOSTON FOR TWO DAYS.

05:31.699 --> 05:33.767
AND I TAKE CARE OF THE BABY,
BUT HE'S GONE!

05:33.801 --> 05:34.902
- OKAY, IMELDA,
CALM DOWN.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.003
TELL US WHAT HAPPENED.

05:36.036 --> 05:36.937
- OKAY, I WENT
TO BED LAST NIGHT,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.072
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.
AND THIS MORNING,

05:39.106 --> 05:41.074
I CHECKED THE CRIB,
AND THE CRIB WAS EMPTY.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.776
AND I LOOKED HERE,
AND I LOOKED OUT ON THE STREET.

05:42.810 --> 05:44.578
BUT S-SOMEBODY STOLE HIM.

05:44.612 --> 05:46.013
- WHY DIDN'T
YOU CALL ANYBODY FOR HELP?

05:46.046 --> 05:47.448
- WHAT DO YOU THINK
I AM DOING?

05:47.481 --> 05:48.949
I'M PRAYING SOMEONE
WILL FIND JASPER.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.051
- YOUR PRAYERS
HAVE BEEN ANSWERED.

05:51.084 --> 05:54.455
WE FOUND THE BABY,
AND HE'S ALIVE.

05:54.488 --> 05:56.156
- GRACIAS POR DIO!
GRACIAS!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.892
- THE NEIGHBOR SAID HE HEARD
SCREAMING HERE LAST NIGHT.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.094
WHO WAS HERE
WITH YOU?

06:01.128 --> 06:03.063
- NO ONE. I WAS ALONE.

06:03.096 --> 06:04.398
- YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT, IMELDA?

06:04.432 --> 06:06.934
THERE'S A, UM...

06:06.967 --> 06:08.869
JUST FOUND A CONDOM
IN THE BATHROOM.

06:08.902 --> 06:11.038
- OH...
IT MUST BE FROM MISS DEDE.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.173
- YEAH, WELL,
SHE'S BEEN GONE FOR TWO DAYS,

06:13.206 --> 06:16.844
AND THIS LOOKS, UM...
KIND OF FRESH.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.147
- COME ON, IMELDA,
TELL THE TRUTH.

06:20.180 --> 06:23.984
- UH...OKAY, OKAY.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.786
MY BOYFRIEND WAS HERE.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.555
BUT HE WOULD
NEVER TAKE THE BABY.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.722
HE'S A RICH GUY.

06:28.756 --> 06:30.190
HE'S A HIGH-CLASS MAN,
AS YOU SAY.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.493
- GIVE ME A NAME.

06:32.526 --> 06:35.095
- HI, KEN TURNER.
YOU MUST BE DETECTIVE STABLER.

06:35.128 --> 06:38.065
- MR. TURNER, THANKS FOR
GETTING DOWN HERE SO QUICKLY.

06:38.098 --> 06:42.436
WHY DON'T WE GO SOMEWHERE
PRIVATE SO THAT WE CAN TALK.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.605
SAYS HERE
YOU USED TO BE AN A.D.A.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.706
- YEAH, NASSAU COUNTY.

06:45.739 --> 06:47.107
I WOULD'VE STUCK IT OUT,
BUT YOU KNOW,

06:47.140 --> 06:49.109
I COULDN'T MAKE ENDS MEET.
- MM-HMM.

06:49.142 --> 06:52.580
AND NOW YOU WORK FOR
DASCHLE PRIVATE EQUITY

06:52.613 --> 06:53.581
DOING CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS?

06:53.614 --> 06:56.116
- YEAH, I KNOW.
GUYS LIKE ME TANKED THE ECONOMY.

06:56.149 --> 06:57.217
- SO IT IS TRUE.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.219
- WELL, IT'S A LITTLE
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.320
- UH-HUH.
AS COMPLICATED AS

07:00.353 --> 07:02.956
A RICH, POWERFUL GUY
SCREWING SOME IMMIGRANT NANNY?

07:06.226 --> 07:07.495
- I DON'T FOLLOW.

07:07.528 --> 07:08.696
- IMELDA BARRIOS,

07:08.729 --> 07:10.798
LAST NIGHT AT
DEDE ASTON'S BROWNSTONE.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.065
ROUGH SEX,
IT SOUNDS LIKE.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.501
WE FOUND YOUR BROKEN RUBBER.

07:13.534 --> 07:14.968
- ROUGH SEX? NO.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.837
MAYBE A LITTLE...
ENTHUSIASTIC.

07:16.870 --> 07:19.206
BUT THAT'S NOT REALLY
A CRIME, NOW, IS IT, DETECTIVE?

07:19.239 --> 07:22.476
- NO, JUST
A LITTLE STRANGE.

07:22.510 --> 07:24.812
A WALL STREET MILLIONAIRE
IS SCREWING A NANNY

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
WITH HER BOSS'S BABY
IN THE NEXT ROOM?

07:26.847 --> 07:29.617
I MEAN, HOW DOES DEDE ASTON
FEEL ABOUT THAT?

07:29.650 --> 07:32.085
- WELL, DEDE ASTON
DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.053
I MEAN, WE'RE FRIENDS,

07:33.086 --> 07:34.588
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I DON'T TELL HER EVERYTHING.

07:34.622 --> 07:36.223
- LIKE YOU HITTING
ON HER HELP.

07:36.256 --> 07:39.259
- WELL, IMELDA'S BEAUTIFUL.
AND SO IS JASPER.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.961
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL BABY.
I LOVE BABIES.

07:40.994 --> 07:43.096
- ENOUGH TO STEAL ONE?

07:43.130 --> 07:45.065
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

07:45.098 --> 07:46.800
- SOMEONE GRABBED
JASPER LAST NIGHT.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.636
- IS HE OKAY?
- I WOULD WORRY ABOUT YOU

07:48.669 --> 07:50.871
BECAUSE WE FOUND
YOUR FINGERPRINTS ON HIS CRIB.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.674
- JUST TELL ME,
IS JASPER'S ALIVE?

07:53.707 --> 07:55.008
- BARELY. YEAH.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.777
BUT THE PROBLEM IS,
IMELDA SAID

07:56.810 --> 07:58.011
YOU WERE THE LAST PERSON
TO SEE HIM

07:58.045 --> 07:59.947
BEFORE HE WAS
LEFT TO DIE IN AN ALLEYWAY.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
- WELL, YEAH,
MY PRINTS ARE ON HIS CRIB

08:02.015 --> 08:03.216
BECAUSE I WENT TO
CHECK ON HIM.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.952
I CHECKED ON HIM
AROUND MIDNIGHT.

08:04.985 --> 08:07.087
HE WAS FINE.
AND I LEFT.

08:07.120 --> 08:10.123
YOU KNOW, I HAPPEN
TO BE FOND OF THAT BOY.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.961
- ARE YOU SUGGESTING
IMELDA IS NOT?

08:13.994 --> 08:15.596
- IMEL--

08:15.629 --> 08:19.533
LOOK, IMELDA IS BUILT FOR,
YOU KNOW, GREAT SEX.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.969
YOU KNOW, SHE'S
NOT REALLY NANNY MATERIAL.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.004
I MEAN, JASPER CRIES
NO MORE THAN MOST BABIES,

08:24.037 --> 08:25.005
BUT SHE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.040
- SO YOU
THINK IMELDA SNAPPED?

08:29.743 --> 08:32.145
- I'M ONLY
SAYING IT WAS POSSIBLE.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.184
- SO, THINK
HE'S OUR BABY-NAPPER?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.218
- CAN'T RULE HIM OUT,

08:38.251 --> 08:40.554
BUT HE DEFINITELY
RULED IMELDA IN.

08:40.588 --> 08:43.023
SAID BABY JASPER'S
CRYING DRIVES HER CRAZY.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.958
- I'LL GO PICK HER UP.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.093
- [sighs]

08:46.126 --> 08:47.294
SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO ABOUT KEN?

08:49.997 --> 08:52.866
- WELL, LET HIM GO.

08:52.900 --> 08:56.103
FOR NOW.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.705
- DETECTIVE BENSON?

08:57.738 --> 08:59.807
- YES.
- I'M JASPER'S MOTHER.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.974
I GOT YOUR MESSAGES.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.610
I CAME STRAIGHT
FROM THE AIRPORT.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.111
WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.146
- MS. ASTON,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

09:07.681 --> 09:08.782
- SWEETHEART!

09:08.816 --> 09:10.918
- BABY,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.986
- [sighs]
- SWEETHEART?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.756
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU TWO WERE JUST FRIENDS.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.760
- KEN'S MY FIANCE.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.328
- OH.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.631
TELL ME, WHAT'S GOING ON?

09:31.905 --> 09:34.041
- JASPER'S MY MIRACLE.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.843
WHEN CAN I TAKE HIM HOME?

09:35.876 --> 09:37.778
- AS SOON AS
HE'S MEDICALLY CLEARED

09:37.811 --> 09:40.814
AND WE CAN MAKE SURE
THAT HE'S SAFE.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.285
- WHY WOULDN'T
HE BE SAFE WITH ME?

09:45.318 --> 09:46.519
- WE KNOW THAT
YOU WERE OUT OF TOWN,

09:46.553 --> 09:49.289
BUT WE NEED TO RULE OUT EVERYONE
WHO HAS ACCESS TO YOUR HOME.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.391
- FINE.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.392
HOW CAN I HELP?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.861
- WELL, WHY DON'T
WE START AT THE BEGINNING?

09:53.894 --> 09:55.195
WHEN DID YOU ADOPT JASPER?

09:55.228 --> 09:56.329
- SEVEN WEEKS AGO.

09:56.363 --> 09:58.866
- AND HAVE YOU HAD ANY CONTACT
WITH THE BIRTH MOTHER?

09:58.899 --> 10:00.267
- NO, I DON'T
EVEN KNOW HER NAME.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.703
IT WAS A CLOSED ADOPTION.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.304
KEN DID THE LEGAL WORK.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.339
- YOUR FIANCE, KEN?
- YES.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.408
IT WAS A FRIEND OF
ONE OF HIS ASSOCIATES

10:08.441 --> 10:12.780
THAT KNEW THIS PREGNANT GIRL,
AND SHE COULDN'T KEEP HER BABY.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.648
KEN KNEW I WAS LOOKING.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.949
- AND YOU WERE ALREADY
ENGAGED AT THIS POINT?

10:15.983 --> 10:18.852
- NO. I BARELY KNEW KEN.

10:18.886 --> 10:22.389
IT WAS THIS ADOPTION
THAT SPARKED THINGS FOR US.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.324
[cell phone ringing]

10:24.357 --> 10:26.393
EXCUSE ME.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.929
I'M A MANAGEMENT CONSULTANT.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.065
AND MY WHOLE LIFE
HAS BEEN WORK, WORK, WORK.

10:32.099 --> 10:33.734
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T
EVEN HAVE TIME TO DATE.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.302
- I HEAR YOU.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.337
- WHEN I WASN'T GUNNING
FOR THE NEXT PROMOTION,

10:37.370 --> 10:39.840
I WAS OFF ON
A BUSINESS TRIP SOMEWHERE.

10:39.873 --> 10:42.109
- LIKE THE ONE TO BOSTON.
- YEAH.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.812
AND EVEN TWO DAYS AWAY
FROM JASPER

10:44.845 --> 10:46.113
WAS BREAKING MY HEART.

10:46.146 --> 10:49.149
IT'S LIKE BEING A MOTHER
MADE ME HUMAN AGAIN

10:49.182 --> 10:52.285
AND ABLE TO
FALL IN LOVE WITH KEN.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.188
- STILL, THAT'S
A PRETTY FAST ENGAGEMENT.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.090
- WHAT CAN I SAY?

10:57.124 --> 10:59.459
KEN'S, UM...PERFECT.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.162
- YOU KNOW, DEDE,

11:02.195 --> 11:03.864
I THINK THAT
JASPER'S IN PRETTY GOOD HANDS.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.899
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME
DOWN TO THE PRECINCT?

11:05.933 --> 11:07.434
- SINCE WHEN
IS STANDARD PROCEDURE

11:07.467 --> 11:09.369
KEEPING A FAMILY
SEPARATED LIKE THIS?

11:09.402 --> 11:10.871
- WHEN THE SOON-TO-BE
MAN OF THE HOUSE

11:10.904 --> 11:12.439
IS BANGING
HIS FIANCEE'S NANNY.

11:12.472 --> 11:14.341
- I WENT OVER TO MAKE SURE
JASPER WAS OKAY

11:14.374 --> 11:15.776
WITH DEDE BEING GONE.

11:15.809 --> 11:16.944
OUT OF NOWHERE,
IMELDA JUMPS ME.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.211
- AND SHE WAS SO HOT

11:18.245 --> 11:19.412
THAT YOU JUST
COULDN'T RESIST DOING HER.

11:19.446 --> 11:20.814
- IT WAS
A MOMENT OF WEAKNESS.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.315
I'M SORRY,
IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.317
- WE DO IT ALL THE TIME.

11:24.351 --> 11:27.354
EVERY TIME DEDE'S OUT,
KEN COMES OVER TO BE WITH ME.

11:28.756 --> 11:29.990
HE'S UNSTOPPABLE.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.491
- HE EVER FORCE YOU?
- NO, NO.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.228
I LIKE IT.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.396
- IS THAT IMELDA
I SAW IN THE OTHER ROOM?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.932
- UH, YEAH.
- WHY IS MS. DEDE IN THERE?

11:38.966 --> 11:40.433
- WHY'S SHE HERE?

11:40.467 --> 11:42.169
- SHE'S JUST HELPING US
FIGURE THIS ALL OUT.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.204
JUST LIKE YOU.
- LISTEN, I'M CONFUSED.

11:44.237 --> 11:46.073
IF KEN LOVES YOU SO MUCH,

11:46.106 --> 11:47.775
WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN HE TIES THE KNOT

11:47.808 --> 11:48.909
WITH YOUR BOSS IN THERE?

11:48.942 --> 11:50.377
- KEN'S NOT
GOING TO MARRY DEDE.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.412
HE'S JUST WAITING FOR
THE RIGHT TIME TO DUMP HER.

11:52.445 --> 11:54.314
- JUST LIKE YOU
DUMPED JASPER.

11:54.347 --> 11:55.816
- ON THE VIRGIN,
I SWEAR I DIDN'T DO IT.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.150
I WOULD
NEVER HURT THAT BOY.

11:57.184 --> 11:58.485
- OKAY, IMELDA.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.921
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT GETTING PREGNANT?

12:00.954 --> 12:02.089
- WHY ARE
YOU ASKING ME THAT?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.357
- KEN'S CONDOM
BROKE LAST NIGHT.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.394
- HE'S A MANIAC IN BED.

12:07.427 --> 12:10.430
- KEN IS SO EASYGOING.
AND HE'S JUST SO GENTLE.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.967
WE HAVE NO PROBLEMS.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.403
IT'S LIKE I'VE
FINALLY FOUND MR. PERFECT.

12:16.436 --> 12:19.840
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT KEN AND IMELDA

12:19.873 --> 12:23.410
ARE DOING BEHIND YOUR BACK.

12:23.443 --> 12:27.247
- WHAT IS THAT DETECTIVE
TALKING ABOUT IN THERE?

12:27.280 --> 12:29.316
- LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
THAT'S PISSING DEDE OFF.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.550
- [muted]
SHE SEDUCED HIM.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.320
IS SHE STILL IN THAT ROOM?

12:33.353 --> 12:36.156
IMELDA!

12:36.189 --> 12:37.524
ARE YOU IN THERE?

12:37.557 --> 12:38.826
YOU'RE A SLUT!

12:38.859 --> 12:40.060
- GROSERA!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.495
SHE'S SAYING
BAD THINGS ABOUT ME.

12:42.529 --> 12:45.298
- SHE TOOK JASPER, AND
SHE PUT HIM IN THAT ALLEYWAY

12:45.332 --> 12:47.767
TO MAKE KEN LEAVE ME
SO SHE COULD HAVE HIM!

12:49.870 --> 12:50.938
- SINVERGUENZA!

12:50.971 --> 12:52.305
- YOU STOLE MY BABY!
- NO, YOU DID!

12:52.339 --> 12:53.340
- NO, I WAS IN BOSTON!

12:53.373 --> 12:55.208
- YOU SAY
HE HURTS YOUR CAREER!

12:55.242 --> 12:56.343
- YOU'RE CRAZY!
I LOVE MY SON!

12:56.376 --> 12:58.578
- STOP.
- STOP IT.

12:58.611 --> 12:59.813
CALM DOWN.

13:02.883 --> 13:06.119
BUT ON THE SUBJECT OF
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT...

13:06.153 --> 13:08.021
- WHAT,
NOW YOU SUSPECT ME?

13:09.522 --> 13:10.323
- SHOULD I?

13:10.357 --> 13:12.192
- I WAS IN BOSTON.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.861
- YOU SAID YOU CAME
STRAIGHT FROM THE AIRPORT.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.963
BUT I DIDN'T SEE
ANY BAGS.

13:15.996 --> 13:17.430
- WHAT ARE
YOU ACCUSING ME OF?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.799
- NOTHING, IF YOU SHOW ME
YOUR BOARDING PASS.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.309
- OKAY, I NEVER WENT.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.078
- SO YOU WERE HERE
IN NEW YORK LAST NIGHT?

13:31.111 --> 13:32.846
- I WAS AT THE WALDORF.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.848
- WHY'D YOU LIE?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.286
- I WANT KEN.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.321
- EVEN THOUGH KEN'S BEEN
HAVING SEX WITH YOUR NANNY?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.556
- HE'S MY LAWYER!

13:43.590 --> 13:46.860
I WANT HIM RIGHT NOW!

13:48.595 --> 13:50.497
- WE'RE
IN THIS TOGETHER, BABY.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.399
- OH, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO HOLD UP ON THAT, MR. TURNER,

13:52.432 --> 13:55.035
SEEING AS HOW
YOUR CLIENT CONFESSES

13:55.068 --> 13:57.604
TO BEING IN NEW YORK
LAST NIGHT, AND NOT IN BOSTON.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.573
- I'M SORRY, I--

14:00.607 --> 14:03.176
HOW COULD YOU
SLEEP WITH IMELDA?

14:04.477 --> 14:05.612
- I'M SORRY.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.414
SHE CAME ON TO ME.

14:07.447 --> 14:10.417
YOU KNOW, I KNOW IT'S WRONG,
BUT SHE'S YOUNG AND EXOTIC.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.619
- AND WHAT AM I,
YOUR GRANDMOTHER?

14:12.652 --> 14:14.254
- NO!

14:14.287 --> 14:16.924
BABY, YOU'RE
MATURE AND SOPHISTICATED.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.425
LISTEN, I LOVE YOU.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.060
- OKAY,
THAT'S ENOUGH, ROMEO.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.661
I THINK WHAT'S IMPORTANT

14:21.694 --> 14:24.364
IS WHY DEDE WAS AT
THE WALDORF LAST NIGHT.

14:26.266 --> 14:28.201
- THINKING.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.571
ABOUT WHAT TO DO.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.573
KEN, I'M PREGNANT.

14:33.606 --> 14:36.376
- SWEETHEART,
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

14:36.409 --> 14:37.911
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

14:37.945 --> 14:40.313
- I HAD TO BE ALONE,
I HAD TO DECIDE WHAT TO DO.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.049
- WHAT'S TO DECIDE?
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE IT.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.017
- JASPER'S ALREADY
SO MUCH FOR US--

14:44.051 --> 14:45.418
- THIS WILL
BE GREAT FOR JASPER.

14:45.452 --> 14:47.387
IT'D BE SO GOOD
FOR JASPER TO HAVE A SIBLING.

14:47.420 --> 14:48.588
- WHOA, KEN.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.590
I THINK
THAT'S DEDE'S DECISION.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.159
- OF COURSE.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.494
BUT SHE KNOWS HOW IMPORTANT
THIS IS TO OUR FAMILY.

14:54.527 --> 14:55.929
RIGHT?

14:55.963 --> 14:57.564
SWEETHEART, COME HERE.

15:01.134 --> 15:02.269
LOOK AT ME.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.271
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.273
- REALLY?

15:06.306 --> 15:08.241
- YEAH.
- OH.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.342
- YES, I LOVE YOU.

15:09.376 --> 15:13.480
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, AND
I'M HAPPY THAT CONDOM BROKE.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.348
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,

15:15.382 --> 15:19.219
AND I WILL ALWAYS
LOVE THIS BABY.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.354
- DEDE...

15:21.388 --> 15:24.424
CLEARLY THIS PREGNANCY
WAS UNPLANNED.

15:24.457 --> 15:27.627
NOW, YOU AND KEN
USE CONDOMS, RIGHT?

15:27.660 --> 15:30.663
I BET KEN'S CONDOMS
BREAK A LOT.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.465
AND THAT'S
WHY YOU GOT PREGNANT.

15:32.499 --> 15:34.467
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

15:34.501 --> 15:35.535
- IT'S A LUCKY GUESS.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.636
AND HERE'S ANOTHER ONE.

15:36.669 --> 15:41.474
AS CHARMING AS
YOUR LOVING FIANCE IS,

15:41.508 --> 15:43.510
HE'S
A REPRODUCTIVE ABUSER.

15:43.543 --> 15:45.412
- EXCUSE ME?
AN ABUSER?

15:45.445 --> 15:48.315
- YOU WANT BABIES,
AND YOU USE WOMEN TO MAKE THEM.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.050
- OH, AND YOU GOT THAT
FROM A RIPPED CONDOM?

15:50.083 --> 15:51.718
- THE STANDARD
FAIL RATE IS 1%.

15:51.751 --> 15:54.587
NOW, DEDE, I BET KEN'S RATE IS
A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.023
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
OUR CONDOMS BREAK

15:56.056 --> 15:57.324
BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MUCH
FUN IN BED, TELL HER.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.391
- OR BECAUSE

15:58.425 --> 16:02.329
YOU POKE TINY LITTLE HOLES
IN THEM AHEAD OF TIME.

16:02.362 --> 16:04.131
NOW, THE CONDOM
LOOKS NORMAL GOING ON,

16:04.164 --> 16:06.366
AND THEN, OOPS!
IT RIPS WHEN YOU'RE HAVING SEX.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.269
DEDE, THIS IS A TYPICAL MOVE
OF A REPRODUCTIVE ABUSER.

16:09.302 --> 16:10.637
- YOU KNOW WHAT, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LISTEN TO THIS.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.373
I HAVE NEVER ABUSED YOU,
YOU KNOW THAT.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.375
I LOVE YOU.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.744
AND THIS BABY IS
AN EXPRESSION OF OUR LOVE.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.046
AND THAT'S WHY
WE HAVE TO HAVE IT.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.548
- DEDE,
ALL THIS PHONY SWEET TALK

16:21.581 --> 16:23.383
IS TO GET YOU TO GIVE IN.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.551
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.319
WE DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THIS ANYMORE.

16:26.353 --> 16:28.621
UNLESS YOU'RE GONNA CHARGE US.
SO ARE YOU CHARGING US?

16:28.655 --> 16:30.257
NO, ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

16:30.290 --> 16:32.359
LET'S GO.

16:32.392 --> 16:34.227
- COME ON,
HE'S PLAYING YOU, DEDE.

16:34.261 --> 16:36.029
OPEN YOUR EYES.
- SHE SEES THE TRUTH.

16:36.063 --> 16:37.630
A MAN WHO'S
TOTALLY DEVOTED TO HER.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.532
SWEETHEART,
YOU ARE GLOWING.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.368
TRUST ME,
THIS IS THE RIGHT THING.

16:41.401 --> 16:43.336
IT'S THE RIGHT THING FOR US,
FOR JASPER,

16:43.370 --> 16:46.539
AND FOR OUR NEW BABY.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.108
- DID HE JUST
SAY DEDE'S PREGNANT?

16:48.141 --> 16:50.343
- KEN IS A SNAKE
WHO POKES HIS CONDOMS.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.412
CLASSIC
REPRODUCTIVE ABUSER.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.281
- HE SABOTAGES
THE BIRTH CONTROL,

16:54.314 --> 16:56.116
AND THEN CONVINCES
THE WOMAN TO CARRY THE BABY.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.150
- A BABY ONLY HE WANTS.

16:57.184 --> 16:59.619
- QUESTION STILL REMAINS,
DID HE STEAL JASPER?

16:59.652 --> 17:01.288
- I DON'T THINK SO.

17:01.321 --> 17:03.056
- WHAT DO YOU GOT?

17:03.090 --> 17:05.725
- SOME HAIRS FROM THE BLANKET
JASPER ASTON WAS FOUND IN.

17:05.758 --> 17:08.461
NOW, MOST MATCHED HAIRS
FROM THE BROWNSTONE--

17:08.495 --> 17:10.397
DEDE ASTON'S,
IMELDA BARRIOS'...

17:10.430 --> 17:11.564
- NOT SURPRISING.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.466
- BUT WE FOUND ONE RED HAIR.

17:13.500 --> 17:14.801
- NOBODY ON OUR RADAR
HAS RED HAIR.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.403
- I CAN NARROW
IT EVEN FURTHER FOR YOU.

17:16.436 --> 17:19.072
WE GOT ENOUGH FOLLICLE
FOR A DNA SAMPLE,

17:19.106 --> 17:20.540
AND A NEW
FORENSIC TECHNIQUE ALLOWS US

17:20.573 --> 17:22.242
TO DETERMINE EYE COLOR
FROM THOSE GENES.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.810
- OKAY,
SO RED HAIR AND WHAT?

17:23.843 --> 17:25.412
- BLUE EYES.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.514
- THAT'S NOT KEN...

17:27.547 --> 17:28.615
- THAT'S DEDE'S
DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBOR.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.218
WHAT'S THAT GUY'S NAME?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.752
WADE FISK?

17:32.785 --> 17:34.587
- YOU THINK
I KIDNAPPED JASPER?

17:34.621 --> 17:38.258
- NO, NOT THINK.
WE'VE GOT ROCK-SOLID FORENSICS

17:38.291 --> 17:39.426
PUTTING YOUR HANDS
ON THE KID'S BLANKET.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.328
- YOU GOT IT WRONG.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.363
- YOU SNUCK INTO
DEDE'S LAST NIGHT,

17:43.396 --> 17:44.597
YOU STOLE HER BABY,

17:44.631 --> 17:46.566
AND YOU LEFT HIM OUTSIDE
TO FREEZE TO DEATH.

17:46.599 --> 17:47.867
- NO.
- WHY?

17:47.900 --> 17:49.836
WHY TRY
TO KILL AN INFANT?

17:49.869 --> 17:52.205
- I WASN'T
TRYING TO KILL HIM!

17:52.239 --> 17:54.874
I WAS TRYING TO SAVE HIM.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.176
- SAVE HIM?

17:56.209 --> 17:58.145
- FROM THAT HELLHOLE
UPSTAIRS.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.747
LOOK, I'VE KNOWN
DEDE FOR YEARS.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.516
SHE'S LEVEL-HEADED, SMART.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.385
SHE'D BE A GREAT MOM IF
IT WEREN'T FOR THAT DOUCHE BAG.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.120
- KEN TURNER.
- WHEN HE'S NOT

18:07.154 --> 18:09.556
NAILING THE NANNY,
HE'S BANGING SOME OTHER GIRL.

18:09.589 --> 18:10.857
I SWEAR
WHEN SHE'S OUTTA TOWN,

18:10.890 --> 18:12.825
HE USES DEDE'S PLACE
AS HIS PARTY PAD.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.561
AND WHEN SHE'S IN TOWN--

18:14.594 --> 18:16.429
- HE'S MANIPULATING
THE HELL OUT OF HER.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.431
- LIKE A PUPPET
ON A STRING.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.200
- JUST BECAUSE DEDE'S
IN LOVE WITH SOME JERK

18:20.233 --> 18:21.668
DOESN'T MEAN
SHE'S NEGLECTING HER BABY.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.836
- LAST NIGHT HE WAS SCREAMING
HIS LUNGS OUT FOR HOURS.

18:23.870 --> 18:28.175
KEN AND IMELDA JUST
IGNORED HIM, KEPT SCREWING.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.810
- SO YOU THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER
TO DUMP HIM IN AN ALLEY?

18:30.843 --> 18:33.380
- I LEFT HIM
OUTSIDE TUMBLE WEEDS!

18:33.413 --> 18:35.215
PEOPLE THERE LOVE KIDS.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.450
I WRAPPED HIM UP
REAL WELL AND LEFT HIM.

18:37.484 --> 18:39.552
- YEAH, BY THE BACK DOOR,

18:39.586 --> 18:41.321
WHERE THEY PUT OUT
THE GARBAGE.

18:41.354 --> 18:43.223
- IF I PUT HIM OUT FRONT,
ANYONE COULD'VE TAKEN HIM.

18:43.256 --> 18:46.459
BUT BY THE BACK DOOR,
IT'D BE PEOPLE WHO WORK THERE.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.461
PEOPLE WHO WOULD MAKE SURE
HE WAS PUT IN A GOOD HOME.

18:48.495 --> 18:51.564
- THAT KID NEARLY DIED.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.566
NOW, DON'T YOU THINK IT
WOULD'VE BEEN A LITTLE SAFER

18:53.600 --> 18:55.735
IF YOU'D JUST TOLD DEDE
THAT KEN WAS PLAYING HER?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.437
- I TRIED.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.706
BUT HE'S GOT
HER HEAD SCREWED AROUND.

18:59.739 --> 19:03.510
I'M TELLING YOU,
KEN'S A MONSTER.

19:03.543 --> 19:07.447
I'VE OVERHEARD HIM ON THE PHONE
OUTSIDE DEDE'S PLACE.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.449
HE SAYS THINGS.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.252
- WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

19:12.285 --> 19:13.953
- DEDE, I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT ALL THIS.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.822
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
WADE WOULD DO THIS.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.824
I TRUSTED HIM.
HE WAS MY FRIEND.

19:17.857 --> 19:20.493
WE WENT ON DIVES TOGETHER.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.462
- GUESS YOU NEVER
REALLY KNOW WHO SOMEONE IS.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.564
- WHAT WOULD POSSESS
A MAN TO DO SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

19:24.597 --> 19:26.233
- OVERHEARING YOU
ON THE PHONE,

19:26.266 --> 19:27.534
BRAGGING
ABOUT YOUR EXPLOITS.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.702
- WHATEVER
WADE TOLD YOU IS A LIE.

19:29.736 --> 19:31.504
- KEN, WHAT
ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT?

19:31.538 --> 19:33.273
- WE DID
A RECORDS SEARCH AND FOUND

19:33.306 --> 19:35.842
SOME VERY INTERESTING STUFF
ABOUT YOUR FIANCE.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.544
- STUFF THAT PROVES
MY PARTNER'S RIGHT.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.512
YOU REALLY ARE
A REPRODUCTIVE ABUSER.

19:39.546 --> 19:40.313
AND A BUSY ONE.
- CAN YOU PLEASE

19:40.347 --> 19:42.582
STOP SAYING "ABUSER"?
- DEDE...

19:42.615 --> 19:46.653
JUST TAKE
A LOOK AT THAT.

19:46.686 --> 19:47.854
- WHAT IS THIS?

19:47.887 --> 19:49.456
- THEY'RE
BIRTH CERTIFICATES.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.291
CHECK OUT THE NAME
LISTED UNDER "FATHER."

19:56.596 --> 19:57.964
- KEN TURNER.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.633
- HE'S FATHERED 20 KIDS
IN THE LAST TEN YEARS.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.537
- IS THIS TRUE?

20:04.571 --> 20:06.306
- WELL, I TOLD YOU
I LOVE KIDS.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.441
- DEDE...

20:08.475 --> 20:09.742
- WHAT IS THIS?

20:09.776 --> 20:11.978
- WE ALSO RAN JASPER'S DNA

20:12.011 --> 20:13.546
AGAINST THE SEMEN
THAT WAS FOUND

20:13.580 --> 20:15.715
IN THE RIPPED CONDOM
THAT HE USED WITH IMELDA.

20:15.748 --> 20:17.016
- THERE'S
A REASON KEN WANTED

20:17.049 --> 20:19.286
YOUR ADOPTION
OF JASPER TO BE CLOSED.

20:19.319 --> 20:22.322
- DEDE,
HE'S JASPER'S FATHER.

20:23.623 --> 20:24.991
- OH, MY GOD...

20:25.024 --> 20:26.859
- ISN'T THAT GREAT?

20:26.893 --> 20:29.896
AND NOW I'M
GONNA HAVE ONE WITH YOU.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.343
- YOU HAVEN'T BUSTED
THAT CREEP YET?

20:43.376 --> 20:44.977
- LOVE TO.
BEING A CREEP ISN'T ILLEGAL.

20:45.011 --> 20:46.413
- THAT'S THE HARDEST PART
OF THE JOB.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.381
- MAYBE AUDREY
CAN MAKE IT EASIER.

20:48.415 --> 20:49.682
DR. AUDREY SHELTON,

20:49.716 --> 20:51.851
THIS IS DETECTIVE TUTUOLA
AND DETECTIVE STABLER.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.119
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- HOW DO YOU DO?

20:53.152 --> 20:56.489
- SO AUDREY LED A SEMINAR THAT
I TOOK ON REPRODUCTIVE ABUSERS.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.824
- WE'VE GOT A WHOPPER HERE.

20:57.857 --> 20:59.626
- 20 KIDS?

20:59.659 --> 21:02.429
- 21, WHEN DEDE'S BUN
POPS OUT OF THE OVEN.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.063
- SO AUDREY, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A LITTLE GUIDANCE

21:04.096 --> 21:07.467
ON HOW TO NAIL THIS GUY.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.336
- HE'S POKING HOLES
IN CONDOMS, ISN'T HE?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.404
- MM-HMM, AND UNFORTUNATELY,
THAT'S NOT ILLEGAL.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.573
- PUTTING SEMEN IN A WOMAN
WITHOUT HER CONSENT

21:13.606 --> 21:15.308
SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RAPE.

21:15.342 --> 21:17.344
- THE A.D.A.
DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

21:17.377 --> 21:19.846
SO, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
THAT GUYS LIKE THIS DO?

21:19.879 --> 21:22.382
- REPRODUCTIVE ABUSERS
USE VERBAL COERCION

21:22.415 --> 21:24.083
TO MAKE WOMEN HAVE BABIES.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.419
- WE CAN'T COLLAR THIS GUY
FOR WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.054
- WHEN THEIR WORDS DON'T WORK,

21:28.087 --> 21:30.323
SOME USE THEIR FISTS
TO GET WHAT THEY WANT.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.692
- THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
KEN IS HITTING DEDE.

21:32.725 --> 21:35.094
- BUT WE DO HAVE KEN'S
20 OTHER BABY-MAMAS TO ASK.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.195
WE SHOULD TRACK THEM DOWN.

21:36.228 --> 21:38.598
- SEE IF KEN IS BEATING
ANY OF THEM INTO SUBMISSION.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.367
- OR WENT
EVEN FURTHER THAN FISTS.

21:40.400 --> 21:42.535
SOMETIMES VERBAL
COERCION LEADS TO RAPE.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.837
REAL, PROSECUTABLE RAPE.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.439
- WE'RE BOUND
TO FIND SOMETHING

21:46.473 --> 21:47.707
IF WE KICK OVER
ENOUGH ROCKS.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.510
- I KNOW ONE
WE CAN START KICKING.

21:50.543 --> 21:54.113
I FOUND JASPER'S
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

21:54.146 --> 21:55.615
HADN'T BEEN FILED.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.351
WHAT I DIDN'T FIND WAS ANY
RECORD OF ADOPTION.

21:58.385 --> 21:59.519
- DEDE THINKS IT'S LEGAL.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.755
- WELL, LET'S ASK JASPER'S
BIRTH-MOTHER IF SHE AGREES.

22:04.991 --> 22:06.459
- KEN RENTED SKATES
FROM ME,

22:06.493 --> 22:08.561
CHATTED ME UP,
ASKED ME OUT ON A DATE.

22:08.595 --> 22:10.963
WE ONLY HAD SEX ONCE.

22:10.997 --> 22:15.402
BUT THEN HE FOUND OUT
I GOT...PROBLEMS.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.736
- WHAT ARE YOU USING,
BRIDGET?

22:16.769 --> 22:18.771
- WHATEVER YOU GOT.

22:20.773 --> 22:23.443
- SO LET ME GUESS,
YOU GOT PREGNANT.

22:23.476 --> 22:24.744
YOU THOUGHT THAT
KEN WOULD DISAPPEAR

22:24.777 --> 22:28.080
BECAUSE YOU'RE AN ADDICT.
BUT HE WAS THRILLED.

22:28.114 --> 22:30.950
- I ONLY WANTED HIM
TO PAY FOR THE ABORTION,

22:30.983 --> 22:34.020
BUT BEFORE I KNEW IT, KEN...
[chuckles]

22:34.053 --> 22:35.688
CHECKED ME INTO REHAB,

22:35.722 --> 22:38.124
RENTED ME
A NICE APARTMENT,

22:38.157 --> 22:41.428
EVEN PROMISED TO
MARRY ME.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.729
- A WHOLE NEW LIFE
FROM ONE CONDOM

22:42.762 --> 22:44.163
THAT ACCIDENTALLY RIPPED.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.066
- AT FIRST,
IT WAS AMAZING.

22:47.099 --> 22:50.837
I WAS CLEAN...
IN LOVE.

22:50.870 --> 22:54.006
MY BEAUTIFUL BOY
GROWING INSIDE ME...

22:54.040 --> 22:55.174
- SO WHY'D
YOU GIVE HIM UP?

22:55.207 --> 22:57.109
- THE WEEK JASPER
WAS BORN,

22:57.143 --> 23:00.146
SOME FRIENDS OF MY FRIENDS
CAME TO SEE HIM.

23:01.614 --> 23:03.883
I JUST DID
A LITTLE BLOW, BUT...

23:03.916 --> 23:05.184
- KEN FOUND OUT.

23:05.217 --> 23:06.819
SAID YOU WEREN'T FIT
FOR MOTHERHOOD.

23:06.853 --> 23:10.457
- HE WASN'T MEAN
ABOUT IT.

23:10.490 --> 23:13.626
HE SAID HE FOUND
SOMEONE WHO WOULD

23:13.660 --> 23:15.495
GIVE JASPER A BETTER LIFE.

23:15.528 --> 23:17.196
SAID IF I REALLY CARED,

23:17.229 --> 23:19.065
THEN I'D SEE
I HAD NO CHOICE.

23:19.098 --> 23:21.468
- BUT YOU
DID HAVE A CHOICE.

23:21.501 --> 23:23.970
- IT'S SO HARD TO THINK
WHEN KEN WAS AROUND.

23:24.003 --> 23:27.774
THE WAY HE TALKS,
HE'S...SO CONVINCING.

23:29.509 --> 23:33.680
HE TOOK
MY LITTLE JASPER.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.783
I CAN STILL SEE
KEN CARRYING HIM AWAY.

23:39.486 --> 23:42.489
HIS LITTLE CHEEKS.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.828
- BRIDGET, DID YOU EVER
TRY TO GET JASPER BACK?

23:48.861 --> 23:51.130
- YEAH.

23:51.163 --> 23:53.666
YEAH, TWO WEEKS AFTER.

23:53.700 --> 23:56.002
BUT KEN SAID
IT WAS TOO LATE.

23:56.035 --> 23:59.238
- A BIRTHMOTHER HAS 45 DAYS
TO CHANGE HER MIND.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.974
- YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THEY TOLD ME
WHEN I WENT DOWN TO CITY HALL.

24:02.008 --> 24:05.111
BUT THERE WAS
NO ADOPTION RECORD,

24:05.144 --> 24:06.646
SO THERE WAS
NOTHING I COULD DO.

24:06.679 --> 24:07.780
- DID YOU SIGN PAPERWORK?

24:07.814 --> 24:10.717
- YEAH.
HE CONVINCED ME TO.

24:12.284 --> 24:15.087
- BRIDGET, DO YOU
STILL WANT YOUR SON BACK?

24:15.121 --> 24:19.058
- MORE THAN ANYTHING
IN THE WORLD.

24:25.231 --> 24:27.700
- FINALLY SOMETHING
WE CAN ARREST HIM FOR.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.602
- I HOPE SO.
- HOPE SO?

24:29.636 --> 24:30.903
KEN DIDN'T FILE
THE PAPERWORK.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.271
THAT MEANS
HE STOLE BRIDGET'S BABY.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.675
- AND THOSE WARRANTS CAN BE
PRETTY TRICKY TO GET.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.243
- YEAH, OUR SYSTEM'S READY,

24:37.276 --> 24:39.278
SO JUST SEND IT.
OKAY, THANKS.

24:39.311 --> 24:40.146
- DID IT GO THROUGH?

24:40.179 --> 24:42.982
- THE WARRANT
TO LOCATE KENNETH TURNER

24:43.015 --> 24:46.018
VIA CELL PHONE GPS
HAS BEEN EXECUTED.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.153
AND THERE YOU GO.

24:47.186 --> 24:49.021
- OKAY, 65TH AND LEXINGTON.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.256
THERE'S
A FLOWER SHOP THERE.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.158
- HOW MUCH YOU WANNA BET
HE'S NOT BUYING ROSES

24:52.191 --> 24:54.126
FOR HIS SICK GRANNY?

24:54.160 --> 24:56.162
- HE'S ON THE MOVE,
WALKING ACROSS THE STREET.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.230
- YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT'S THERE, RIGHT?

24:58.264 --> 25:01.300
- THAT NEW HOTEL.
THE AHIMSA.

25:01.333 --> 25:04.303
- VERY HIGH-END.
VERY ROMANTIC.

25:04.336 --> 25:07.540
- THAT SON-OF-A-BITCH
HAS ANOTHER DATE.

25:19.285 --> 25:21.053
- GET READY, STACY,
BECAUSE I'M GONNA

25:21.087 --> 25:22.121
ROCK YOUR WORLD...

25:22.154 --> 25:24.591
- ESPECIALLY WHEN
SHE FINDS OUT SHE'S PREGNANT.

25:24.624 --> 25:25.692
- WHAT THE HELL?

25:25.725 --> 25:28.027
- GET DRESSED.
PARTY'S OVER.

25:28.060 --> 25:29.261
- ON WHAT THE CHARGE?

25:29.295 --> 25:33.032
- ENDANGERING THE WELFARE OF
A CHILD AND AN ILLEGAL ADOPTION.

25:33.065 --> 25:34.834
YOU FAILED TO
FILE THE PAPERWORK.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.736
- WHY SHOULD I?
I'M JASPER'S FATHER.

25:36.769 --> 25:39.772
- YOU GAVE HIM OVER TO DEDE
WITHOUT THE MOTHER'S CONSENT.

25:39.806 --> 25:44.677
DON'T THINK THE JURY IS GONNA
LOOK TOO KINDLY UPON THAT.

25:44.711 --> 25:46.613
- KEN,
THIS IS A MISTAKE, RIGHT?

25:46.646 --> 25:48.314
- ANOTHER
BOUNCING BABY MISTAKE

25:48.347 --> 25:49.682
IF HE USED THIS ON YOU.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.652
HOLD IT UP TO THE LIGHT.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.288
- SEE, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'M A GOOD GUY.

25:56.322 --> 25:58.958
- WHO RIPS HIS NEWBORN BABY AWAY
FROM HIS BIOLOGICAL MOTHER.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.693
- BRIDGET'S A COKE FIEND!

26:00.727 --> 26:02.595
SHE'S NOT FIT
TO RAISE MY CHILD.

26:02.629 --> 26:04.230
- YEAH, BUT IT ALSO HAPPENS
TO BE HER CHILD,

26:04.263 --> 26:07.233
AND SHE HAS A RIGHT TO
DECIDE HIS FATE.

26:07.266 --> 26:08.635
SEE, YOU TRIED
TO DO A LITTLE END-AROUND

26:08.668 --> 26:09.936
BY NOT FILING THAT PAPERWORK.

26:09.969 --> 26:10.937
- A MISDEMEANOR.

26:10.970 --> 26:13.239
SEEMS A LITTLE BENEATH

26:13.272 --> 26:14.907
THE SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT,
DOESN'T IT?

26:14.941 --> 26:17.644
- WELL...
WE TAKE ALL CRIME SERIOUSLY.

26:17.677 --> 26:20.079
- SINCE WHEN IS IT A CRIME
TO GIVE JASPER A BETTER MOTHER?

26:20.112 --> 26:22.782
DEDE'S STABLE,
SHE'S SECURE...

26:22.815 --> 26:24.083
- AND YOU LIKE HER SO MUCH

26:24.116 --> 26:26.185
THAT YOU USED
THE OLD BROKEN CONDOM ROUTINE

26:26.218 --> 26:28.087
TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU KNOCKED HER UP.

26:28.120 --> 26:29.288
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
SUCH A HARD-ON FOR ME?

26:29.321 --> 26:32.925
- 'CAUSE YOU CAN'T KEEP YOURS
OUT OF UNSUSPECTING WOMEN.

26:32.959 --> 26:33.726
- I'M JUST TRYING TO FOLLOW

26:33.760 --> 26:36.062
MY NATURAL
MALE URGE TO PROCREATE.

26:36.095 --> 26:38.698
- NO, YOU TURN PEOPLE'S
LIVES UPSIDE-DOWN.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.668
- NO, I'M MAKING
THEIR LIVES RICHER.

26:41.701 --> 26:44.704
WITH MY PROGENY,
AND MY MONEY.

26:46.138 --> 26:49.208
WHAT ABOUT YOU, DETECTIVE?
YOU GOT KIDS?

26:49.241 --> 26:50.376
- YEAH, WITH MY WIFE.

26:50.409 --> 26:53.646
- HOW MANY?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.747
- NOT AS MANY AS YOU.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.215
- HOW MANY, DETECTIVE?

27:01.721 --> 27:04.323
- FIVE.
- FIVE CHILDREN?

27:04.356 --> 27:05.792
THAT'S INTERESTING.

27:05.825 --> 27:09.361
YOU KNOW, THE NATIONAL
AVERAGE IS 1.83.

27:09.395 --> 27:13.332
SEE, I THINK
YOU UNDERSTAND THE URGE,

27:13.365 --> 27:16.936
BUT YOU'RE LIMITED
BY FEAR OR WEAKNESS OR...

27:16.969 --> 27:20.339
LACK OF MEANS...
LACK OF MOJO.

27:20.372 --> 27:23.175
- [chuckles]
- SEE, AT HEART...

27:23.209 --> 27:26.012
I THINK YOU
YOU REALLY WANT TO BE ME.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.314
- A SAD, LITTLE MAN WITH
AN INFERIORITY COMPLEX

27:28.347 --> 27:30.750
TRYING SO DESPERATELY
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

27:30.783 --> 27:34.320
- INFERIORITY COMPLEX?
NO, I'M MONTEZUMA, MAN.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.254
- [chuckles]

27:35.287 --> 27:38.224
- THE AZTEC LEADER
WITH 4,000 CONCUBINES

27:38.257 --> 27:39.959
AND WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY KIDS--

27:39.992 --> 27:41.393
- AND WHO PRACTICED
HUMAN SACRIFICE.

27:41.427 --> 27:43.295
- [chuckles]
- YOU KNOW HOW I KNOW THAT?

27:43.329 --> 27:45.898
- MM, BECAUSE
YOU PASSED SEVENTH GRADE.

27:45.932 --> 27:47.166
- I HELPED MY CHILDREN

27:47.199 --> 27:48.935
WITH THEIR HOMEWORK
EVERY NIGHT.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.938
AND I GAVE THEM LOVE

27:51.971 --> 27:56.275
AND I GAVE THEM ATTENTION
EVERY DAY.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.210
NOW, HOW MUCH TIME
DO YOU SPEND WITH YOUR KIDS?

27:58.244 --> 28:00.980
'CAUSE IT SEEMS
TO ME YOU SPEND ALL OF IT

28:01.013 --> 28:03.149
TRYING TO MAKING MORE.

28:03.182 --> 28:07.053
SEE, BEING A FATHER
IS ABOUT SUPPORT,

28:07.086 --> 28:09.321
HM?
NOT SPAWN.

28:09.355 --> 28:13.059
- EVERY MAN DREAMS
OF BEDDING LOTS OF WOMEN.

28:13.092 --> 28:15.261
C'MON, ADMIT IT,
DETECTIVE.

28:15.294 --> 28:18.197
YOU KNOW YOU
WANT TO BANG YOUR PARTNER.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.499
WATCH HER GROW SWOLLEN
WITH YOUR CHILD.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.834
AND WHY NOT, MAN?

28:21.868 --> 28:24.236
SHE'D GIVE YOU
BEAUTIFUL BABIES...

28:24.270 --> 28:27.840
- YOU ARE
A SICK SON-OF-A-BITCH.

28:27.874 --> 28:30.877
- [chuckles]

28:32.278 --> 28:35.347
[door opening,
closing loudly]

28:35.381 --> 28:37.249
- HE'S THE WORST
I'VE EVER SEEN.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.284
- THAT'S SAYING A LOT.

28:38.317 --> 28:39.485
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN DOING THIS?

28:39.518 --> 28:41.954
- MY WHOLE LIFE, REALLY.
MOM'S A THERAPIST.

28:41.988 --> 28:43.756
- OH, DAD WAS A COP.

28:43.790 --> 28:46.025
NOT THAT I EVER WANTED
TO FOLLOW IN HIS FOOTSTEPS.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.226
- ME EITHER, BUT...

28:47.259 --> 28:49.962
MY SISTER'S BOYFRIEND BEAT
THE HELL OUT OF HER ONE NIGHT.

28:49.996 --> 28:50.963
NEXT THING I KNOW,

28:50.997 --> 28:54.366
I WAS A DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE COUNSELOR IN BUFFALO.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.268
- WELL,
I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT...

28:56.302 --> 28:58.237
IT MIGHT BE EASIER
IF THIS GUY WAS HITTING WOMEN.

28:58.270 --> 29:02.208
- HIS CHARM IS
WHAT MAKES HIM SO DANGEROUS.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.043
THERE'S NO LIMIT
TO THE NUMBER OF WOMEN

29:04.076 --> 29:05.544
WHOSE LIVES HE CAN WRECK.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.413
THANK GOD
YOU ARRESTED HIM.

29:07.446 --> 29:10.182
- THAT IS NOT GONNA STICK.
- YOU SPOKE WITH HARDWICKE.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.151
- SHE SAID A MISDEMEANOR
IS NOT WORTH HER TIME,

29:12.184 --> 29:15.121
ESPECIALLY SINCE IT RESTS
ON A PAPERWORK TECHNICALITY.

29:15.154 --> 29:16.122
SHE SAID ANY
GOOD DEFENSE ATTORNEY

29:16.155 --> 29:18.190
WOULD GET KEN OFF
WITH A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.959
- YOU BROUGHT HIM IN
JUST TO LET HIM GO?

29:19.992 --> 29:21.794
- WELL, WE THOUGHT
OUR D.A. MIGHT PUNT,

29:21.828 --> 29:23.295
SO WE HAVE A BACK-UP PLAN.
YOU ALL SET?

29:23.329 --> 29:25.297
- MM-HMM.

29:25.331 --> 29:26.532
- THERE ARE NO CELL PHONES
ALLOWED IN HERE.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.200
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.502
- YOU KNOW, DETECTIVE,
I'D CONSIDER SUING YOU

29:30.536 --> 29:33.172
FOR HARASSMENT,
BUT FOR YOUR KIDS' SAKE,

29:33.205 --> 29:35.007
I'D HATE TO SEE YOU
LOSE YOUR JOB.

29:35.041 --> 29:38.044
- SWEET OF YOU.
LET ME WALK YOU OUT.

29:47.153 --> 29:49.288
- LOOK, LESLIE,
THERE'S YOUR FATHER!

29:49.321 --> 29:51.891
- [scoffs]
YOUR GIRL'S FATHER?

29:51.924 --> 29:53.459
KEN'S MY BOY'S DAD.

29:53.492 --> 29:55.194
- CUTE, DETECTIVE.
REAL CUTE.

29:55.227 --> 29:58.430
SO NOW I GUESS YOU
EXPECT ME TO WILT, RIGHT?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.266
- KEN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:00.299 --> 30:03.903
- WELL, THIS IS THE NYPD'S
VAIN ATTEMPT AT EMBARRASSING ME.

30:03.936 --> 30:06.472
TO MAKE YOU ALL REALIZE
HOW MANY OF YOU THERE ARE.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.141
- YOU SON OF A BITCH!

30:09.175 --> 30:11.443
YOU SAID
I WAS YOUR ONE AND ONLY.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.345
- CLOWN SAID HE'D MARRY ME.

30:13.379 --> 30:15.547
- AND ME.
- [sighs]

30:15.581 --> 30:18.150
- JENNY,
YOU SAID LITTLE LESLIE'S

30:18.184 --> 30:19.518
THE BEST THING
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.

30:19.551 --> 30:22.288
- AND YOU SAID
WE WERE GOING TO BE A FAMILY.

30:22.321 --> 30:26.292
NOW I'M A SINGLE MOM,
I HAD TO DROP OUT OF MED SCHOOL.

30:26.325 --> 30:29.896
- WELL, MY CHILD'S MORE
IMPORTANT THAN MED SCHOOL.

30:29.929 --> 30:32.631
- AND, KATE, KATE, YOU CALL ME
AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK.

30:32.664 --> 30:36.302
- BECAUSE I WANT YOU
TO SPEND TIME WITH ZACK.

30:36.335 --> 30:38.204
HE'S GROWING UP
WITHOUT A FATHER.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.072
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
I'M A GREAT FATHER.

30:40.106 --> 30:41.407
WHO SENDS A CHECK
EVERY MONTH.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.076
YOU KNOW
I'M YOUR DADDY, HUH?

30:44.110 --> 30:46.378
ATTA BOY.
ALL RIGHT, SON.

30:46.412 --> 30:49.248
DEDE...

30:56.588 --> 30:58.424
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T
SLEEP WITH YOU, RIGHT?

30:58.457 --> 31:00.326
- [laughing]
NO.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.094
NO, JUST
MY DAUGHTER TRISH.

31:02.128 --> 31:04.463
- OH, TRISH, RIGHT.
HOW'S LITTLE MARK?

31:04.496 --> 31:06.098
THE NAME IS MAX.

31:06.132 --> 31:08.067
AND HE'S DEAD,
JUST LIKE HIS MOTHER.

31:08.100 --> 31:10.269
- WHAT? HOW?

31:10.302 --> 31:13.505
- WHEN YOU REFUSED TO
LET THEM MOVE IN WITH YOU,

31:13.539 --> 31:18.010
TRISH DROVE HOME,
CLOSED THE GARAGE,

31:18.044 --> 31:21.247
AND LEFT
THE MOTOR RUNNING.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.149
SHE THEN
GOT IN THE BACK SEAT

31:23.182 --> 31:25.918
AND READ MAX
GOOD NIGHT, MOON.

31:27.219 --> 31:30.222
UNTIL THEY BOTH DIED
FROM THE CARBON MONOXIDE.

31:34.160 --> 31:36.062
- SHE HAD
NO RIGHT TO KILL MY SON.

31:36.095 --> 31:37.930
- OH, YOU--
- YOU REALLY FEEL YOU HAVE

31:37.964 --> 31:40.199
NO RESPONSIBILITY
IN ANY OF THIS?

31:40.232 --> 31:43.535
- THEY'RE MY CHILDREN.
OF COURSE I FEEL RESPONSIBLE.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.271
I LOVE THAT THEY'RE MINE.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.205
- SHAME ON YOU.

31:46.238 --> 31:49.208
YOU'VE OVERTURNED
THE LIVES OF 20 WOMEN.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.043
- OVERTURNED?
NO.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.312
IMPROVED?
YES.

31:53.345 --> 31:56.515
AND 20?
NOT EVEN CLOSE.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.050
- WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

31:58.084 --> 32:00.219
- YOU ONLY CHECKED
IN NEW YORK.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.955
LOOK AROUND THE COUNTRY,
A BIT INTO EUROPE,

32:02.989 --> 32:05.992
YOU'LL FIND
I HAVE 47 CHILDREN.

32:07.293 --> 32:09.128
AND I LOVE EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF THEM.

32:15.501 --> 32:18.604
[quietly]
MAGGIE!

32:18.637 --> 32:21.607
- IT'S AMAZING THAT A GUY
CAN BLAZE A TRAIL OF DESTRUCTION

32:21.640 --> 32:23.575
SO WIDE AND STILL
NOT DO ANYTHING ILLEGAL.

32:23.609 --> 32:26.045
- WELL, IT TOOK
THE COURTS A LONG TIME

32:26.078 --> 32:28.114
TO RECOGNIZE
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS A CRIME.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.249
- MAYBE AUDREY'S RESEARCH
CAN RAISE AWARENESS

32:30.282 --> 32:34.453
ABOUT REPRODUCTIVE COERCION
AND PASS LAWS ABOUT IT.

32:34.486 --> 32:36.755
POKING HOLES IN CONDOMS
WILL BECOME FRAUD

32:36.788 --> 32:37.990
WITH INTENT TO DECEIVE.
- SURE.

32:38.024 --> 32:41.260
FLUSHING BIRTH-CONTROL PILLS
DOWN THE TOILET BECOMES LARCENY.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.163
- AND BEING A WORLD-CLASS CREEP
CAN GET YOU DEAD AS A DOORNAIL.

32:44.196 --> 32:45.497
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

32:45.531 --> 32:47.099
- KEN TURNER
WAS JUST FOUND DEAD

32:47.133 --> 32:49.335
IN THE GARDEN
BEHIND DEDE'S BROWNSTONE.

32:49.368 --> 32:51.303
APPARENTLY,
IT WAS GRUESOME...

32:51.337 --> 32:55.241
JUST WHEN YOU THINK
YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING.

32:57.176 --> 32:58.477
- LOOKS LIKE HE ATE A BOMB.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.279
- NEIGHBOR SAID
SHE HEARD A SCREAM

33:00.312 --> 33:02.514
AND THEN WHAT SHE
DESCRIBED AS A "WET BANG."

33:02.548 --> 33:05.351
LOOKS LIKE DEDE WENT
FROM THINKING HE'S MR. PERFECT

33:05.384 --> 33:07.319
TO HATING HIS GUTS.

33:07.353 --> 33:10.389
- ENOUGH TO BLOW 'EM
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

33:21.300 --> 33:22.501
- FIND THE MURDER WEAPON?

33:22.534 --> 33:24.270
- NOT EVEN CLOSE.

33:24.303 --> 33:26.372
NOT THAT I KNOW
WHAT DOES THAT TO A GUY.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.807
- WHATEVER IT IS, DID IT FAST.
NO DEFENSIVE WOUNDS.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.676
- I'M NOT SURE IT WAS DEDE.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.745
HER LIGHTS ARE OUT,
HER MAIL'S ON THE STOOP,

33:33.779 --> 33:36.548
LIKE SHE HASN'T BEEN HOME
SINCE SHE LEFT THE PRECINCT.

33:36.582 --> 33:40.419
- WE'VE GOT ACCESS BACK HERE
FROM WADE FISK'S APARTMENT.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.521
- WADE'S IN CUSTODY
FOR STEALING JASPER.

33:42.554 --> 33:45.557
- UNLESS HE MADE BAIL.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.761
DECIDED TO SLAY
THE MONSTER, HUH?

33:49.795 --> 33:51.730
- I DIDN'T TOUCH KEN,
I SWEAR.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.665
- JUST LIKE YOU SWORE
YOU DIDN'T STEAL JASPER.

33:53.699 --> 33:54.833
- I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

33:54.866 --> 33:56.335
I MADE BAIL, CAME HOME,

33:56.368 --> 33:57.536
HEARD SOMETHING LOUD
IN BACK.

33:57.569 --> 33:58.704
WENT OUT
TO SEE WHAT IT WAS,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.307
AND THERE WAS KEN...
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.209
- AND SO YOU FIGURED
IT'S TIME TO SEE EUROPE

34:03.242 --> 34:05.344
LIKE YOU ALWAYS
DREAMED OF.

34:05.377 --> 34:07.413
- IT'S NO SECRET
I HATED THE GUY.

34:07.446 --> 34:09.315
I KNEW YOU'D BLAME ME.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.283
SEARCH MY PLACE.
YOU WON'T FIND ANYTHING.

34:11.317 --> 34:13.352
- OH.

34:13.385 --> 34:16.388
THANKS
FOR THE PERMISSION.

34:27.233 --> 34:29.335
I KNOW HOW YOU KILLED HIM.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.703
IT'S CALLED
A WASP INJECTION KNIFE.

34:31.737 --> 34:33.772
- LOOKS LIKE
A STANDARD DIVE KNIFE.

34:33.805 --> 34:35.674
- BUT IT'S NOT; IT WAS
DEVELOPED FOR THE NAVY SEALS

34:35.707 --> 34:37.809
BECAUSE OF THE SPECIAL PUNCH
THAT IT PACKS.

34:37.843 --> 34:40.279
INSIDE THE HANDLE
IS A CANISTER THAT SHOOTS

34:40.312 --> 34:42.448
A BALL OF COMPRESSED CO2

34:42.481 --> 34:44.750
INTO WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU'RE STABBING,

34:44.783 --> 34:48.587
INSTANTLY INFLATING IT
TO THE SIZE OF A BASKETBALL.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.756
- MAKES SENSE FOR DIVING.
YOU STAB A SHARK WITH IT,

34:50.789 --> 34:52.591
AND IT ROCKETS
UP TO THE SURFACE.

34:52.624 --> 34:54.893
- AND IT'S BLOWN
TO BITS BY 800 P.S.I.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.595
- WHOA.

34:56.628 --> 34:58.830
- JUST LIKE KEN.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.833
- WHAT IS THAT?

35:01.867 --> 35:03.335
- THE MURDER WEAPON
YOU USED ON KEN.

35:03.369 --> 35:05.471
- A WASP KNIFE?

35:05.504 --> 35:06.705
- LOOKIE THERE,
HE KNOWS WHAT IT IS.

35:06.738 --> 35:07.506
- JUST BECAUSE
I'M A DIVER DOESN'T MEAN--

35:07.539 --> 35:10.342
- YOU HAD MOTIVE.
YOU HATED KEN.

35:10.376 --> 35:11.877
- AND YOU HAD OPPORTUNITY.

35:11.910 --> 35:13.679
PRIVATE ACCESS
TO THAT BACK GARDEN?

35:13.712 --> 35:16.482
- NO.
DEDE HAS ACCESS...

35:16.515 --> 35:17.716
- OH, SO SHE
WENT DOWN INTO YOUR PLACE

35:17.749 --> 35:18.750
AND STOLE
YOUR KNIFE, HUH?

35:18.784 --> 35:20.652
- DEDE'S A DIVER TOO.

35:20.686 --> 35:21.820
THAT'S HOW
I CAME TO RENT FROM HER.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.855
WE MET ON A DIVE TRIP.

35:23.889 --> 35:27.926
AND DEDE...
OWNS ONE OF THOSE.

35:27.959 --> 35:30.596
- HELL, YES,
I HAVE A WASP KNIFE.

35:30.629 --> 35:32.864
SAVED ME FROM
A HAMMERHEAD IN FLORIDA

35:32.898 --> 35:35.234
ABOUT, UH, TWO YEARS AGO.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.868
- SO WHEN
A SHARK LIKE KEN TURNER

35:36.902 --> 35:38.704
WALKS INTO YOUR LIFE
AND TAKES A BITE OUT OF IT,

35:38.737 --> 35:41.307
YOU FIGURE,
"HEY, IT WORKED ONCE,

35:41.340 --> 35:43.742
IT'LL WORK AGAIN."
- I HATE KEN.

35:43.775 --> 35:46.745
YOU AND DETECTIVE STABLER
CONVINCED ME.

35:46.778 --> 35:49.781
OKAY, I HATE HIM.
[sighs]

35:49.815 --> 35:52.418
BUT HE'S STILL
THE FATHER OF MY BABY.

35:52.451 --> 35:53.885
AND FOR THAT REASON ALONE,
I WOULD NEVER--

35:53.919 --> 35:56.522
- DEDE, THE MAN WAS
KILLED IN YOUR GARDEN

35:56.555 --> 35:59.625
WITH YOUR DIVE KNIFE.

36:01.727 --> 36:04.796
- WELL, SOMEBODY TOOK MY KNIFE
AND USED IT ON HIM.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.798
- SO SOMEBODY ENTERED
YOUR APARTMENT WITH KEN,

36:06.832 --> 36:09.435
FOUND YOUR KNIFE,
USED IT?

36:09.468 --> 36:10.536
OKAY, WHO HAS THE KEY?

36:10.569 --> 36:12.704
- KEN!
HE HAS A KEY.

36:12.738 --> 36:15.807
HE USED MY HOUSE
LIKE HIS DAMN LOVE SHACK.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.210
IT WASN'T JUST IMELDA.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.279
IT WAS DOZENS OF
OTHER WOMEN.

36:20.312 --> 36:23.382
ANYTIME I WAS AWAY.
- AND YOU KNEW ABOUT THIS?

36:23.415 --> 36:25.917
- I'D SMELL PERFUME
OR I SAW THE BED RE-MADE.

36:25.951 --> 36:31.223
BUT I WOULDN'T LET MYSELF
BELIEVE IT, I GUESS, I--

36:31.257 --> 36:34.560
YOU KNOW, KEN WAS SO GOOD
AT SWEET-TALKING YOU,

36:34.593 --> 36:37.729
AND SAID HE HAD NO INTEREST
IN YOUNGER WOMEN.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.265
- REMINDING YOU
OF YOUR AGE.

36:39.298 --> 36:40.599
EXPLOITING YOUR FEAR
OF LOSING HIM...

36:40.632 --> 36:42.401
- LAST NIGHT,
THAT'S WHAT THEY ALL SAID.

36:42.434 --> 36:46.738
KEN COULD SWEET-TALK YOU OUT OF
ANY SUSPICION YOU MIGHT HAVE.

36:46.772 --> 36:50.676
- ALL WHO?
- THE WOMEN YOU BROUGHT IN.

36:50.709 --> 36:53.512
LAST NIGHT,
AFTER KEN LEFT, UM...

36:53.545 --> 36:56.848
AUDREY SUGGESTED THAT WE GO
TO A RESTAURANT

36:56.882 --> 37:00.519
DOWN THE STREET AND TALK
ABOUT WHAT KEN HAD DONE TO US.

37:00.552 --> 37:03.822
AND THAT'S WHERE I WAS
WHEN, UM...

37:03.855 --> 37:05.724
WHEN KEN WAS MURDERED.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.825
[door opens abruptly]

37:06.858 --> 37:08.860
- LIV,
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.699
- WE HEARD
YOU ARRESTED DEDE.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.033
- YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

37:15.066 --> 37:16.668
- DEDE'S INNOCENT.

37:16.702 --> 37:17.669
- OKAY, WHAT
GIVES YOU THAT IDEA?

37:17.703 --> 37:19.905
- SHE WAS WITH US LAST NIGHT,
THE WHOLE TIME.

37:19.938 --> 37:21.740
AFTER WE LEFT HERE.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.276
- SO MAYBE ONE OF YOU WANTS
TO STEP FORWARD AND CONFESS?

37:24.310 --> 37:26.278
- IT WASN'T ANY OF US.
WE WERE TOGETHER.

37:26.312 --> 37:27.713
ASK THE RESTAURANT...

37:27.746 --> 37:29.715
- THAT'S WHY WE ALL CAME.
TO PROVE IT.

37:29.748 --> 37:31.049
- WELL,
ALL OF YOU AREN'T HERE.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.752
WHERE'S AUDREY?

37:33.785 --> 37:35.321
WAS AUDREY
WITH YOU LAST NIGHT?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.822
- LADIES, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING BY COMING HERE.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.324
BUT IF YOU DON'T TELL US
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

37:38.357 --> 37:41.360
YOU'RE ACCESSORIES
AFTER THE FACT.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.831
- AUDREY WAS WITH US
AT THE BEGINNING.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.534
BUT THEN HER PHONE RANG
AND SHE WENT OUTSIDE TO TAKE IT.

37:48.567 --> 37:49.901
- OKAY,
WHAT TIME WAS THAT?

37:49.935 --> 37:52.938
- 8:30.
SHE NEVER CAME BACK.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.975
[pounding]
- AUDREY, OPEN UP!

37:57.008 --> 38:00.011
- [from inside]
DOOR'S OPEN, OLIVIA.

38:10.922 --> 38:13.792
RELAX.
IF I WERE GOING TO USE IT,

38:13.825 --> 38:16.728
I'D HAVE PLUNGED IT
IN HERE ALREADY.

38:18.764 --> 38:19.731
- YOU KNEW WE WERE COMING.

38:19.765 --> 38:22.934
- OF COURSE.
YOU'RE GOOD COPS.

38:28.807 --> 38:30.542
- WE KNOW ABOUT BUFFALO.

38:30.576 --> 38:33.845
- I'M IMPRESSED.

38:33.879 --> 38:35.781
- YOU ASSAULTED THAT GUY
WITH A BASEBALL BAT.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.416
YOU PUT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.817
WHY?

38:38.850 --> 38:42.488
- HE WAS RAPING 10-YEAR-OLDS.

38:42.521 --> 38:45.391
NEWSPAPER CALLED ME
A LOCAL HERO.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.992
D.A. DECLINED TO PROSECUTE.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.895
AND KEN TURNER
HADN'T BROKEN ANY LAWS.

38:49.928 --> 38:51.763
- DON'T GIVE ME THAT,
STABLER.

38:51.797 --> 38:53.499
YOU WANTED HIM PUNISHED TOO.

38:53.532 --> 38:56.902
- I DID WANT HIM PUNISHED,
NOT DEAD.

38:56.935 --> 38:59.371
- THINK OF THE SUFFERING
I'VE PREVENTED.

38:59.405 --> 39:01.006
ALL THE UNWANTED PREGNANCIES.

39:01.039 --> 39:03.008
[chuckles]
MY OWN,

39:03.041 --> 39:05.844
IF HE'D GOTTEN HIS WAY.

39:05.877 --> 39:08.146
- SO HE CALLED YOU
LAST NIGHT

39:08.179 --> 39:09.815
AFTER SEEING YOU
IN THE PRECINCT.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.618
- WASN'T TWO HOURS
AFTER WE LEFT.

39:12.651 --> 39:15.887
THE GALL OF THAT GUY,
ASKING ME OUT,

39:15.921 --> 39:18.023
INVITING ME
OVER TO DEDE'S PLACE.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.991
- AUDREY, YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO SAY YES.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.793
- I WAS ABOUT
TO TELL HIM TO GO TO HELL,

39:21.827 --> 39:25.931
BUT...SOMETHING CLICKED.

39:25.964 --> 39:29.401
LIKE WITH
THAT PERV IN BUFFALO.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.102
- SO YOU KNEW
YOU HAD TO GET HIM.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.672
- SOON AS I GET THERE,

39:33.705 --> 39:36.141
HE INVITES ME OUT
INTO THE GARDEN,

39:36.174 --> 39:38.744
STARTS SEDUCING ME.

39:38.777 --> 39:41.580
I TOLD HIM I NEEDED
TO USE THE BATHROOM,

39:41.613 --> 39:43.749
AND I WENT
LOOKING FOR A KNIFE.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.884
FOUND ME A DOOZIE.

39:48.019 --> 39:50.522
I JOINED HIM
IN THE GARDEN...

39:50.556 --> 39:54.760
I JUST MEANT
TO CUT HIS PENIS OFF,

39:54.793 --> 39:58.063
BOOM!
KEN BURSTS OPEN.

39:58.096 --> 40:01.099
[laughing]

40:03.735 --> 40:06.738
- COME ON, AUDREY,
IT'S TIME TO GO.

40:08.139 --> 40:12.911
- PLEASE, OLIVIA.
JUST A FEW MORE SIPS.

40:12.944 --> 40:14.913
THEY DON'T SERVE WINE
WHERE I'M GOING.
