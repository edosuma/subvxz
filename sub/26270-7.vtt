00:01.902 --> 00:03.171
-9-1-1. What's your emergency?
-(siren wailing)

00:03.204 --> 00:05.206
Let's get him out of here
before this thing blows!

00:05.239 --> 00:07.041
Catch all-new episodes Mondays,

00:07.075 --> 00:08.842
and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.876 --> 00:12.012
Empire, The Resident,
and The Gifted.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.582
We are going to show you
the dawn of a new age.

00:14.615 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.722
BUCK:
If there's one hard thing
you learn in this job

00:21.755 --> 00:24.992
it's that,
one way or the other,

00:25.025 --> 00:27.661
this day or the next,

00:27.695 --> 00:30.898
eventually...

00:30.931 --> 00:33.534
everything dies.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.339
For most people,
the only thing worse

00:38.372 --> 00:40.374
than losing someone you love

00:40.408 --> 00:43.777
is knowing that, one day,

00:43.811 --> 00:45.446
you will.

00:45.479 --> 00:49.117
Mom, Dad,

00:49.150 --> 00:54.054
I want you to know I-I've
decided to sell the house.

00:54.088 --> 00:57.458
I know how much
it meant to you guys.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.993
It did to me, too.

01:01.262 --> 01:04.098
Please don't be mad.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.435
(sighs)

01:14.775 --> 01:16.677
(low groan)

01:22.082 --> 01:23.584
(gasps)

01:26.454 --> 01:28.122
(low groaning)

01:34.595 --> 01:35.963
So, we have one guy
still missing?

01:35.996 --> 01:37.565
Yes, it's horrible.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.400
Elisio and Stavros
were preparing

01:39.433 --> 01:41.235
Mrs. Mandechek's
final resting place,

01:41.269 --> 01:43.771
-and they just got sucked in.
-Okay.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.608
Sir, can you tell me
what happened down there?

01:47.641 --> 01:49.410
Me and Stavros were...

01:49.443 --> 01:50.911
digging a plot...

01:50.944 --> 01:52.846
(coughs)
when we got pulled in.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.948
Like the grave
was digging itself.

01:54.982 --> 01:58.352
A sinkhole. The quake shifted
everything around down there.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.354
We're all basically walking
around on eggshells

02:00.388 --> 02:02.756
and bubble wrap.
See it?

02:02.790 --> 02:04.925
-How long ago did this happen?
-I don't know.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.160
Half an hour, maybe?

02:06.194 --> 02:08.496
Let's move, guys.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.934
Whoa...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.769
Easy. This whole side
is like quicksand.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.138
I don't want you to fall
in there and drag ten tons

02:18.172 --> 02:20.208
of loose soil on top of yourself
and our friend down there.

02:20.241 --> 02:22.142
He's been breathing dirt
for a half hour, Cap.

02:22.176 --> 02:23.143
Well, maybe not.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.145
What are you thinking?

02:25.179 --> 02:26.980
Eggshells and bubble wrap.

02:27.014 --> 02:28.616
Air pockets.

02:28.649 --> 02:31.685
Yeah, we just have to find out
where they are.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.155
Whoa, th-those aren't...

02:35.189 --> 02:36.524
BOBBY:
Coffins and corpses.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.058
That's where
the air pockets are.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.393
-That's messed up.
-(beeping)

02:39.427 --> 02:41.061
BOBBY:
Oh. Hello, Stavros.

02:41.094 --> 02:42.463
All right, shovels and buckets.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.398
Let's go.

02:44.432 --> 02:46.334
Here you go.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.570
Got one.

02:54.442 --> 02:56.977
-Whoa!
-Whoa. You okay?
-Yeah.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.513
Okay, that can't be good.

02:59.547 --> 03:01.349
Keys for this thing?

03:01.382 --> 03:02.716
Sh-Should still be in it.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.319
We're gonna
get this man out of here

03:05.353 --> 03:07.555
-one damn way or another.
Clear out!
-Whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.523
-BOBBY: All right, fellas.
-CHIMNEY: Get out.
Get out, guys. Come on.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.892
(engine starts)

03:27.875 --> 03:29.443
-Oh! I got-I got him.
-(Stavros grunting)

03:29.477 --> 03:31.345
Okay, easy. Easy.
You're okay.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.846
-Take it slow. Take...
-(gasping deeply)

03:32.880 --> 03:35.048
CHIMNEY:
All right, we got you.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.785
-HEN: All along... Hang on.
-We got you,

03:37.818 --> 03:40.120
-Stavros, we got you.
-BOBBY: Nice and slow.
-Try to relax.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.122
Breathe, breathe.
Relax. Relax.

03:42.155 --> 03:43.557
We got you. Relax.
We got you.

03:43.591 --> 03:46.760
(grunting)

03:46.794 --> 03:49.597
CHIMNEY:
We got you. Try to relax.

03:49.630 --> 03:52.032
Now, that was strictly badass.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.368
You literally
pulled a man from a grave.

03:54.402 --> 03:57.371
(chuckles) We did.
I just hope they understand.

03:57.405 --> 03:59.206
Hope who understands?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.941
The spirits we disturbed.

04:00.974 --> 04:03.311
I don't need that mess
following me home.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.914
(rumbling)

04:18.125 --> 04:21.329
Hey.
What's going on?

04:21.362 --> 04:23.163
That phone call
was pretty cryptic.

04:23.196 --> 04:24.398
It's about your father.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.233
My father?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.801
What are you talking about,
Karen?

04:27.835 --> 04:29.803
I haven't spoken
to my father since...

04:29.837 --> 04:31.305
I was, like, nine.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.640
He's in the ICU.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.308
-This hospital? He's here?
-Yeah.

04:34.342 --> 04:37.478
He was brought in yesterday,
unconscious.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.548
They've been trying to get
in touch with us ever since.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.752
How did they know
to look for me?

04:44.785 --> 04:47.488
He had your name
and our address in his wallet.

04:51.525 --> 04:54.795
DOCTOR: Your father suffered
an intracerebral hemorrhage.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.097
It caused bleeding
within the brain.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.333
So what's the prognosis here?

04:59.367 --> 05:03.303
Well, we're seeing
severe, widespread damage.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.813
HEN: These machines are the
only thing keeping him alive.

05:16.417 --> 05:19.019
And you want to know whether
or not to withdraw life support.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.788
DOCTOR:
I'm so sorry.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.124
Without an advance directive,
our protocol is to treat,

05:24.157 --> 05:28.596
to keep him alive until
we can contact the next of kin.

05:31.098 --> 05:33.601
And that's me.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.337
911. What is your emergency?

05:37.371 --> 05:38.839
-(radio static):
-HIKER (panting):
Uh, I was hiking,

05:38.872 --> 05:40.674
fell off... (grunts)
The cliff gave out.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.009
Can you-can you hear me?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.677
Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.

05:43.711 --> 05:45.513
I'm here.
Do you know where you fell?

05:45.546 --> 05:47.381
I w... I was on the San Ramon
Trail. I think...

05:47.415 --> 05:49.917
-(feedback whines)
-Oh, God. I broke my leg,
for sure.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.218
I can see the bone in...

05:51.251 --> 05:53.053
I-I can barely hear you, sir.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.055
Can you tell me precisely
where on the trail?

05:55.088 --> 05:57.658
Vista Point, Abalone Cove.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.860
I'm bleeding.
Please, God, help me. Please...

05:59.893 --> 06:01.094
(sharp feedback)

06:01.128 --> 06:02.663
-(beep)
-(noise stops)

06:02.696 --> 06:04.598
Hello?

06:04.632 --> 06:06.767
HEN: I'm staring at

06:06.800 --> 06:08.201
this stranger in this bed,

06:08.235 --> 06:09.437
tubes coming out of him.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.104
I don't know this man.

06:11.138 --> 06:13.373
How am I supposed to make
a life-and-death decision

06:13.407 --> 06:14.875
for a total stranger?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.444
Hen, you do realize

06:16.477 --> 06:18.612
we're not driving around
in a mail truck here?

06:18.646 --> 06:21.715
You make life-or-death decisions
for total strangers

06:21.749 --> 06:23.784
every single day.
How is this any different?

06:23.817 --> 06:27.755
Those total strangers didn't
abandon me when I was nine.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.923
Look, I don't mean
to sound cold,

06:29.957 --> 06:31.525
but is there
really even a decision

06:31.559 --> 06:32.860
that needs to be made here?

06:32.893 --> 06:34.762
I mean, that prognosis--

06:34.795 --> 06:37.364
people don't generally recover
from something like that.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.199
Well, people
don't generally survive rebar

06:39.232 --> 06:41.201
through their brain either.

06:41.234 --> 06:42.970
But then they surprise you.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.574
TouchÃ©.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.886
The old trail
should be right up there.

06:58.919 --> 07:00.921
Park warden said
they closed it down

07:00.954 --> 07:02.623
a few years back.
Guess every once in a while

07:02.656 --> 07:05.225
they still get a thrill-seeker
who ignores the signs.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.627
They haven't been able
to ping the phone?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.962
Yeah. No contact
since the call was dropped.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.509
-Cap.
-Yeah.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.611
Guess this is
where he went over.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.149
All right, everybody gear up.

07:29.182 --> 07:31.318
Hen, Chimney, get the winch
and the guidelines.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.820
Prep a basket just in case.

07:32.853 --> 07:34.154
I'm gonna radio Aerial Recon,

07:34.187 --> 07:35.288
have 'em on standby.

07:35.322 --> 07:36.857
Copy that.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.626
This is Captain Bobby Nash.
T-118.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.695
Aerial Recon to Abalone Cove
in Palos Verdes.

07:41.729 --> 07:43.897
DISPATCHER:
Copy that, T-118.

07:51.505 --> 07:52.405
(grunts)

07:54.875 --> 07:56.810
All right, big jump, Eddie.
Come on.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.828
Buck, Eddie, you guys see
anything down there?

08:15.896 --> 08:17.731
No.

08:17.765 --> 08:20.901
Just a million-dollar view.

08:23.937 --> 08:25.873
Cap, found something.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.240
BOBBY:
Is it our hiker?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.209
(grunts)

08:31.511 --> 08:33.080
A hiker.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.082
Don't think it's the one
we came looking for.

08:35.115 --> 08:36.684
It's human remains, Cap.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.218
Skeletal remains.

08:38.251 --> 08:39.687
All right. Well, flag it
but don't disturb it.

08:39.720 --> 08:40.688
We'll call it in.

08:40.721 --> 08:43.156
Unless...

08:43.190 --> 08:44.992
What, you think
a ghost called 911?

08:45.025 --> 08:46.727
I'm just saying.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.896
IAN (in distance):
Help!

08:48.929 --> 08:51.398
Okay. So, no ghost.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.000
BOBBY:
What's going on
down there, guys?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.602
BUCK:
Yeah, I think we
heard something, Cap.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.370
-(Ian groaning)
-Easy, buddy. We're here.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.007
BUCK:
Hey, Cap, we got a live one.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.174
Can you tell me your name?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.843
(grunts)
Ian.

09:02.876 --> 09:05.045
Ian, okay. We're gonna get you
out of here, okay?

09:05.078 --> 09:07.214
My le-my leg is broken.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.617
(groaning)

09:09.650 --> 09:11.585
All right, guys, we're gonna
send a basket down to you.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.186
How'd you find me?

09:13.220 --> 09:15.022
It wasn't easy.
You weren't on long enough

09:15.055 --> 09:16.456
for them to ping your phone.

09:16.489 --> 09:17.557
On with who?

09:17.591 --> 09:19.727
With, uh, with 911.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.895
I dropped my phone
when I went over.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.631
I didn't call 911.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.998
(groans)

09:32.840 --> 09:34.241
You guys still decorating
those pumpkins?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.209
How many are you making?
(chuckles)

09:36.243 --> 09:38.712
-Oh, and why so many ghosts?
-Well, they're for Buck.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.714
I'm gonna put 'em
all over the firehouse.

09:40.748 --> 09:44.117
-Bobby says he thinks
a ghost called 911.
-BOBBY: Mm.

09:44.151 --> 09:45.986
-That'd be so cool if it did.
-Well, Buck certainly thinks so.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.588
-But ghosts aren't real.
-HARRY: Tommy Sheridan's family

09:48.622 --> 09:51.158
used to live in this apartment
where this little old lady died,

09:51.191 --> 09:52.760
and he said
the lights used to flicker

09:52.793 --> 09:53.994
when they used the tea kettle.

09:54.027 --> 09:55.729
(Athena laughs)

09:55.763 --> 09:57.731
Didn't that building get
red-tagged after the earthquake?

09:57.765 --> 09:59.132
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.734
Sounds more like faulty wiring

10:00.768 --> 10:03.136
than signals
from the other side.

10:03.170 --> 10:07.474
Harry, over 100 billion people
have lived on this planet.

10:07.507 --> 10:10.510
Pretty sure a little old lady
has died everywhere.

10:10.543 --> 10:14.081
Probably even
in this very house.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.749
-(laughs)
-(stammers) All right.
All right, all right, all right.

10:15.783 --> 10:17.284
Enough of that, okay?

10:17.317 --> 10:19.419
Your dad's coming
to pick you up soon.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.588
Why don't you guys
go get your stuff ready.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.957
-Thanks for the help.
I'll let you know how it goes.
-Mm-hmm.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.359
* They did the Monster Mash

10:26.393 --> 10:29.629
* The zombies
were having fun... *

10:29.663 --> 10:31.799
A ghost called 911, huh?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.801
Well, we were out
on this call at Vista Point.

10:33.834 --> 10:35.202
A hiker fell off a cliff.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.204
I sent Buck and Eddie down
to look for him,

10:37.237 --> 10:39.006
and they found bones.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.974
-Human?
-Yeah.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.642
We also found the hiker, alive,

10:42.676 --> 10:44.978
but he dropped his phone
when he went over the edge,

10:45.012 --> 10:47.380
and now Buck is convinced
that it was our skeletal friend

10:47.414 --> 10:48.682
who made the call.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.217
Well, what do you think
happened?

10:50.250 --> 10:52.219
Eh, I think people like
to go hiking on that trail

10:52.252 --> 10:53.821
even though they know
they're not supposed to.

10:53.854 --> 10:56.456
And somebody saw him go over
and picked up his phone,

10:56.489 --> 10:58.191
used it to make the call
so that nobody would know

10:58.225 --> 10:59.292
that they were there, too.

10:59.326 --> 11:00.961
What do you know
about the bones?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.363
Well, not much.
He'd been out there for a while.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.698
He?

11:04.732 --> 11:06.834
Yeah, there was this
wedding band.

11:06.867 --> 11:09.903
Based on the ring size, Eddie
figured it must've been male.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.241
Hmm. Vista Point.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.409
-Palos Verdes, right?
-Yeah.

11:16.443 --> 11:18.045
Why are you getting
all detective on this?

11:18.078 --> 11:20.247
-This isn't your beat.
-I'm a field sergeant.

11:20.280 --> 11:22.349
-I go where I want.
-All right.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.584
Athena Grant.
Hey, Randy?

11:24.617 --> 11:27.020
Yeah, how you doing?

11:27.054 --> 11:31.024
I hear you guys caught
a real cold case today.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.193
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.128
You want to
help me clean this up?

11:36.897 --> 11:38.565
PRINCIPAL:
Our grounds include

11:38.598 --> 11:41.268
two outdoor play areas,
state-of-the-art gymnasium,

11:41.301 --> 11:45.205
music, theater, the full range
of academic offerings,

11:45.238 --> 11:48.441
as well as behavioral
and cognitive programs.

11:50.310 --> 11:52.980
(chuckles)
Look. Um...

11:55.816 --> 11:58.952
The programs sound good,
but Christopher's happiness

11:58.986 --> 12:01.388
is what's important to me.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.556
I want him to feel normal,

12:03.590 --> 12:05.625
not like some special-needs
charity case.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.460
Every child is special.
And, yes,

12:07.494 --> 12:09.729
some do have additional needs,

12:09.763 --> 12:12.966
but they're all equally
our children.

12:13.000 --> 12:16.503
They learn as much from each
other as they do from us.

12:27.147 --> 12:30.083
I think Christopher
would be well cared for.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.418
(chuckles softly)

12:35.622 --> 12:38.792
Okay.
Let's do it.

12:38.826 --> 12:40.493
The only thing left
would be the family interview.

12:40.527 --> 12:43.496
-I'm sorry?
-Oh, Christopher's terrific.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.065
We have your information.
All we need now

12:45.098 --> 12:46.834
is to meet Mrs. Diaz.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.336
That won't be a problem,
will it?

12:49.369 --> 12:50.838
No, it's definitely a problem.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.072
Look, I know
Christopher's mother

12:52.105 --> 12:53.573
is a touchy subject with you,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.809
but I'm sure if we explain
the situation

12:55.843 --> 12:57.744
to Principal Summers
we can find a work around.

12:57.777 --> 13:01.281
Do you have a copy
of the custody agreement?

13:01.314 --> 13:02.850
There isn't one.

13:04.151 --> 13:06.486
We're still married.

13:06.519 --> 13:09.622
-(indistinct chatter)
-(woman screams)

13:09.656 --> 13:11.825
WOMAN:
I don't understand
why people would pay for this.

13:11.859 --> 13:13.593
It's a bunch of guys in masks

13:13.626 --> 13:15.262
making minimum wage
to say "boo."

13:15.295 --> 13:17.865
Hey, I'm paying just to laugh
at you screaming.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.833
-(people shrieking)
(music playing)

13:32.545 --> 13:34.181
Aah!

13:34.214 --> 13:36.716
-Whoa. Okay. (chuckles)
-Okay. Okay.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.921
CHRIS:
Oh, my God.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.358
Uh, Chris,

13:45.392 --> 13:47.895
-tell me you see those.
-(growls)

13:47.928 --> 13:50.063
CHRIS:
Damn, special effects
are on point.

13:50.097 --> 13:52.765
I don't think those
are special effects.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.737
-(gasps) Oh...
-Whoa.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.106
(people screaming)

14:04.777 --> 14:06.713
-CHRIS:
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-(screaming continuing)

14:13.520 --> 14:16.256
Do we know if anybody
was bitten?

14:16.289 --> 14:19.826
You mean in like a Nosferatu,
Count Whatever kind of way?

14:19.859 --> 14:21.261
Listen, something like
ten percent of bats

14:21.294 --> 14:23.030
are rabies carriers.
If I got guys in there

14:23.063 --> 14:24.831
foaming at the mouth,
I need to know.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.733
I don't think. I mean,
most of the injuries

14:26.766 --> 14:28.235
happened in the stampede out.

14:28.268 --> 14:29.669
Anybody left inside?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.238
A few stragglers, maybe.

14:31.271 --> 14:33.840
But we got cast in there
still trapped in their rigs.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.608
Buck, Eddie, head around back,

14:35.642 --> 14:37.177
see if you can figure out
the power situation.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.511
We can't save what we can't see.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.113
On it, Cap.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.215
But, it's not a phobia,
it's not even a fear.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.918
It's just, rats and mice
are way high up on my list

14:44.952 --> 14:46.619
of things that should
absolutely not grow wings.

14:46.653 --> 14:48.421
I mean, how does this happen?

14:48.455 --> 14:50.390
Easy. These dumb-asses
built a haunted house beneath

14:50.423 --> 14:54.227
their natural habitat
during a damn mosquito epidemic.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.732
Ah. Good job, boys.

14:59.766 --> 15:01.901
-Anybody back here?
-Oh, thank God.

15:01.935 --> 15:04.071
My boyfriend--
when the bats spooked,

15:04.104 --> 15:05.538
he ran face-first into the wall.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.174
He hit his head pretty hard.

15:08.675 --> 15:11.111
-I'll say he did.
-(Chris groaning)

15:12.645 --> 15:14.982
CHIMNEY:
Got him.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.218
Sir, can you sit up?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.619
All right, here we go.
(grunts)

15:21.688 --> 15:23.991
-Sir, do you know
what year it is?
-Uh, 2018.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.392
Can you tell me who
the president is?

15:25.425 --> 15:27.494
(chuckles)
Come on, do I have to?

15:27.527 --> 15:28.928
He'll be fine.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.140
Athena.
What are you doing here?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.509
I heard about your, uh,
ghost call.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.344
Oh, God.
Buck won't let it go.

15:44.377 --> 15:46.779
I-It seems like the hiker that
they rescued is gonna be okay.

15:46.813 --> 15:50.617
Yeah. I'm actually here about
the one who wasn't so lucky.

15:50.650 --> 15:52.319
TERRY:
I went back and did
some digging.

15:52.352 --> 15:55.355
I pulled any call
that referenced Vista Point.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.190
You're thinking what--
six, seven years ago?

15:57.224 --> 15:59.592
Our skeleton had a cell.
Pay as you go.

15:59.626 --> 16:01.528
Untraceable, but, uh,

16:01.561 --> 16:03.596
the number was reassigned
six years ago,

16:03.630 --> 16:05.298
so I thought that maybe

16:05.332 --> 16:07.034
that could narrow
the search a little.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.336
-And that's all you have?
-Well, that and this.

16:09.369 --> 16:12.472
Initials on the inside
of a band.

16:12.505 --> 16:15.108
Six letters of the alphabet.
Not much to go on.

16:15.142 --> 16:17.077
Your cell phone lead
might be.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.983
I've got one here.
October 29, 2011.

16:24.017 --> 16:25.985
OPERATOR (on recording):
911. What's your emergency?

16:26.019 --> 16:27.454
-(radio static):
-HIKER (panting):
Uh, I was hiking, fell off...

16:27.487 --> 16:29.056
(grunts)
The cliff gave out.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.058
Can you-can you hear me?

16:31.091 --> 16:33.126
OPERATOR:
You're breaking up.
What's your location?

16:33.160 --> 16:35.528
No. That's not right.
That sounds like my call

16:35.562 --> 16:37.364
from yesterday.
Pull it up.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.134
MADDIE (on recording):
911. What is your emergency?

16:41.168 --> 16:43.002
(radio static)

16:43.036 --> 16:44.837
Uh, I-I can hear you, sir.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.339
I'm here.
Do you know where you fell?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.475
I don't understand.
There was a voice

16:48.508 --> 16:50.477
-on the other end of the line.
-What,

16:50.510 --> 16:52.379
same voice
from seven years ago?

16:52.412 --> 16:55.014
-Yes.
-So a ghost called 911?

16:55.048 --> 16:56.416
He was down there
for seven years.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.718
I guess he got tired of waiting.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.594
-(quietly): So it was a ghost.
-Why are you whispering?

17:07.627 --> 17:09.196
(laughing);
And what did I just say?

17:09.229 --> 17:10.597
Yes, but your tech guy
says it was some kind

17:10.630 --> 17:12.365
of glitch in the system.

17:12.399 --> 17:15.335
(sighs) Turns out a bunch
of the calls had weird static.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.438
Okay, so how do you explain that
it was the exact same call?

17:18.471 --> 17:20.207
I said it sounded
like the same call.

17:20.240 --> 17:21.841
A lot of these calls
sound the same.

17:21.874 --> 17:23.876
Tell yourself that
if it makes you feel better,

17:23.910 --> 17:26.379
but we both know
a ghost called 911.

17:26.413 --> 17:27.947
Okay.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.117
You know, I keep thinking
about the wedding ring.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.219
I mean, you saw it, right?

17:32.252 --> 17:35.388
How many nights someone
was just waiting for news.

17:35.422 --> 17:38.191
I heard somewhere a person
is declared legally dead

17:38.225 --> 17:40.227
after they've been gone
for seven years.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.095
Yeah. I think you have to sign,
like, a petition or something.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.797
God, that is so awful.

17:44.831 --> 17:47.434
Having to admit to the world
that you've lost hope.

17:47.467 --> 17:50.203
Well, seven years
is a long time.

17:50.237 --> 17:52.805
Probably lost hope
way before that.

17:55.408 --> 17:57.610
No one can wait forever.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.915
Yeah, hope is a tricky thing.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.885
Yeah, it keeps you going

18:05.918 --> 18:07.920
for a while, but...

18:07.954 --> 18:10.223
at some point,
if what you're hoping for

18:10.257 --> 18:12.792
is never gonna happen...

18:12.825 --> 18:15.828
then it's just holding you back
from your life.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.231
Yeah, but it's hard
to know, though, right?

18:18.265 --> 18:22.101
If you're hanging on
too long or...

18:22.135 --> 18:25.638
if you're giving up
too soon.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.939
I think you do know.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.812
It just may take you some time
to admit it to yourself.

18:49.229 --> 18:50.963
Well, at least it's neat.

18:50.997 --> 18:54.601
HEN:
I don't know if he
even had a living will.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.169
Doesn't look like there's

18:56.203 --> 18:58.705
a lot of money
laying around for lawyers.

19:00.373 --> 19:03.643
Well, you can find forms online.

19:03.676 --> 19:05.712
Maybe that's what he did.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.215
-Mmm.
-Uh...

19:08.248 --> 19:10.517
I'll go check his desk.

19:24.897 --> 19:26.833
*

19:39.412 --> 19:41.080
How's it going over there?

19:42.882 --> 19:46.018
Babe, come look at this.

19:46.052 --> 19:48.255
What, you found the will?

19:48.288 --> 19:50.089
No.

19:50.122 --> 19:52.191
It's that article
the Times did on paramedics.

19:52.225 --> 19:54.561
Oh, my God,
with that awful photo of me?

19:54.594 --> 19:57.497
I happen to love
that photo of you.

19:57.530 --> 20:00.032
This story is three years old.

20:00.066 --> 20:02.735
How long has my dad
been back here?

20:02.769 --> 20:04.704
(knocking)

20:11.411 --> 20:14.714
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.955
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah.

20:50.650 --> 20:52.652
SHANNON:
He's gotten so big.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.253
(chuckles)

20:58.425 --> 21:00.493
Has...

21:00.527 --> 21:02.495
he asked about me?

21:02.529 --> 21:04.764
Not in a while.

21:04.797 --> 21:06.299
He has a lot
to keep him busy, though--

21:06.333 --> 21:07.800
the move, new school,

21:07.834 --> 21:09.736
-new city, new people.
-Sure, sure.

21:09.769 --> 21:12.238
Yeah.
He must've been shocked

21:12.271 --> 21:14.441
when you said
you were leaving Texas.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.443
I sure was
when you called yesterday.

21:16.476 --> 21:18.578
Shannon...

21:18.611 --> 21:21.381
So... tell me about
this school.

21:23.683 --> 21:25.852
They want to meet you.
Well, need to meet you.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.621
It's a requirement
for admission.

21:28.655 --> 21:31.491
It looks... fancy.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.427
Not the kind of place
I thought you'd be into.

21:34.461 --> 21:36.663
Classes are smaller.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.031
Ten kids instead of 30. Uh...

21:39.065 --> 21:41.768
I mean, the art studio...

21:41.801 --> 21:43.936
-You should have seen him.
-Can I?

21:43.970 --> 21:45.438
See him?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.974
I mean, this is a big step.

21:48.007 --> 21:51.277
Switching schools
when he just got here.

21:51.310 --> 21:54.514
Maybe I could talk to him?

21:54.547 --> 21:56.616
Make sure it's what he wants.

21:56.649 --> 21:58.284
I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.786
It... it might confuse him.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.488
What's confusing?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.623
-I'm his mom.
-Who he hasn't seen

22:03.656 --> 22:05.358
in almost two years?

22:05.392 --> 22:07.527
My mother was sick.
She was all alone.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.496
I... You know
why I had to go.

22:09.529 --> 22:11.864
Yeah, but we were
expecting you to come back.

22:11.898 --> 22:13.633
And you didn't.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.502
You could've come with me.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.404
But you didn't want
to leave Texas

22:17.437 --> 22:20.006
and your parents
and your sisters, and...

22:20.039 --> 22:21.340
At least not until
it was something

22:21.374 --> 22:22.675
that was important to you.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.577
That's not fair.
I was trying to do

22:24.611 --> 22:25.878
-what's best for Christopher.
-Right.

22:25.912 --> 22:27.146
Because Eddie always knows

22:27.179 --> 22:28.548
what's best for everyone.

22:28.581 --> 22:30.517
I mean, God forbid
you stop for a second

22:30.550 --> 22:32.351
and actually ask them
what they need.

22:32.385 --> 22:34.353
What did you need
that I didn't give you?

22:34.387 --> 22:35.388
You!

22:35.422 --> 22:36.656
I needed a husband

22:36.689 --> 22:38.491
and a co-parent.

22:38.525 --> 22:41.894
And instead, all I got was a
life alone in Texas with a baby

22:41.928 --> 22:43.930
and you on another continent.

22:43.963 --> 22:47.400
I needed someone
to have my back.

22:47.434 --> 22:48.701
I always had your back.

22:48.735 --> 22:50.703
No.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.972
You were in Afghanistan.

22:54.774 --> 22:55.808
(door opens, closes)

23:02.582 --> 23:05.184
Thanks again for coming by.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.687
Sometimes I like the quiet
when Michael has the kids.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.523
-Other times, not so much.
-(chuckles)

23:10.557 --> 23:12.725
Are these the remains
we found the other day

23:12.759 --> 23:14.461
-out in Palos Verdes?
-Mm-hmm.

23:14.494 --> 23:16.362
I'm trying to ID them.

23:16.395 --> 23:19.265
You know, notify
the next of kin, hopefully.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.568
-That's your job?
-What, helping people?

23:21.601 --> 23:23.770
I like to think so.

23:23.803 --> 23:25.972
No, no, no. I mean,
don't detectives do that?

23:26.005 --> 23:28.608
I'm sure they're gonna
drop all their hot cases

23:28.641 --> 23:31.210
where the victim just died
and the clues are everywhere

23:31.243 --> 23:33.646
to find out what happened
to a pile of bones

23:33.680 --> 23:37.249
just laying out in the open,
forgotten.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.452
I mean, I'm not saying
they don't care.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.621
They're just too busy.

23:41.654 --> 23:43.656
So, did you run a DNA test?

23:43.690 --> 23:45.925
Yeah, I set one up,
but it's gonna take time.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.260
Dental records
will probably come back first.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.997
Suddenly there's a rush?

23:51.030 --> 23:53.099
Did I ever tell you
about when I decided

23:53.132 --> 23:54.834
to become an officer of the law?

23:58.605 --> 24:00.840
(sighs)
I was nine years old.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.944
Middle of the night.

24:04.977 --> 24:07.780
I wake up and I see
my father getting dressed.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.950
Grabbing a flashlight,
his gun.

24:10.983 --> 24:12.952
I look out the window,

24:12.985 --> 24:15.955
and I see the whole
neighborhood out there.

24:17.156 --> 24:18.591
A little girl--

24:18.625 --> 24:21.828
she was, uh, a grade
behind me at school--

24:21.861 --> 24:25.331
had gone missing.

24:25.364 --> 24:29.035
Someone had just snatched her
right out of her bed.

24:29.068 --> 24:30.870
Nightmare.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.705
They find her?

24:32.739 --> 24:36.108
They found the barrette out
of her hair out in the woods.

24:36.142 --> 24:37.977
But that was it.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.146
She was just gone.

24:42.048 --> 24:45.852
My mother, she went over
to the girl's parents' house

24:45.885 --> 24:49.789
twice a week, bringing food,
that kind of thing.

24:49.822 --> 24:53.025
I almost never saw them
except at church.

24:53.059 --> 24:55.995
That was the only time
they went out.

24:58.765 --> 25:02.535
But I remember how much
they would change.

25:05.872 --> 25:09.709
Just one week of not knowing
where their baby was

25:09.742 --> 25:12.411
was enough to age them.

25:12.444 --> 25:16.382
It was just six months or so
before they were totally broken.

25:16.415 --> 25:18.585
and I promised myself
that when I was old enough

25:18.618 --> 25:20.653
I was gonna
become a policewoman

25:20.687 --> 25:24.290
and find that little girl
for those people.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.359
Ease their pain.

25:27.393 --> 25:28.728
Did you find her?

25:28.761 --> 25:30.529
I did not.

25:36.102 --> 25:38.771
But somebody...

25:38.805 --> 25:40.873
loved this man.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.547
You're thinking
about your father?

25:48.581 --> 25:51.417
He's the ghost
that haunts my brain.

25:51.450 --> 25:54.020
You any closer
to figuring out what to do?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.956
It shouldn't be such a struggle.

25:58.658 --> 26:02.461
I think a part of me
is hoping that

26:02.494 --> 26:06.098
he'll wake up...

26:06.132 --> 26:09.669
so that I can
meet him, finally.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.645
I never even let myself...

26:18.678 --> 26:22.381
imagine who this man was
all these years.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.052
It was just too... much pain

26:26.085 --> 26:29.488
to make him real
in my mind's eye.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.760
(crying):
Which means that...

26:33.793 --> 26:37.129
I've never hated him enough
to feel good

26:37.163 --> 26:40.499
about pulling the plug on him.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.902
Well, now at least you know

26:42.935 --> 26:45.972
he was a man
haunted by his demons

26:46.005 --> 26:49.241
and channeling his own angels.

26:49.275 --> 26:52.111
Like any of us.

26:52.144 --> 26:54.781
(phone vibrating)

26:59.318 --> 27:01.353
I'll be damned.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.455
Medical just got a hit.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.692
You got a name?

27:05.725 --> 27:06.993
Cal State Prison.

27:07.026 --> 27:08.627
Alex Armando Perez.

27:08.661 --> 27:10.663
He was just 22 years old.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.799
He'd only been out six months.

27:19.005 --> 27:20.439
(laughs)

27:20.472 --> 27:22.709
Are you some kind of pirate?

27:24.711 --> 27:26.612
Snake Plissken?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.380
Escape from New York?

27:28.414 --> 27:29.682
Kurt Russell?

27:29.716 --> 27:31.283
John Carpenter's masterpiece?

27:31.317 --> 27:32.719
Oh, right, right.
Well, I prefer

27:32.752 --> 27:34.453
Tango & Cash myself.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.689
But you look cute,
so I approve.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
(laughs)

27:41.861 --> 27:43.629
Though I'm disappointed

27:43.662 --> 27:46.032
that costume
didn't come with a smile.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.870
I had a fight with Shannon.

27:50.903 --> 27:54.173
When I asked her to help
with Christopher and the school,

27:54.206 --> 27:57.009
she asked
to see Christopher first.

27:57.043 --> 27:59.678
And you said no? Okay, if you
want her back in your life,

27:59.712 --> 28:02.248
you're gonna have to ease her
back into it at some point.

28:02.281 --> 28:04.984
-Who said I want her
back in my life?
-Please.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.153
So you decided to leave Texas,

28:07.186 --> 28:10.056
and you just so happened
to choose a job

28:10.089 --> 28:13.325
working 30 minutes
from where your ex lives?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.327
LAFD are the best
in the country.

28:15.361 --> 28:17.997
-In the world.
-If she's gotten herself
back together,

28:18.030 --> 28:20.099
you know what's best
for your son.

28:20.132 --> 28:22.869
And that's for his mother
to be back in his life.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.403
Sooner than later.

28:24.436 --> 28:26.105
What if she screws up again?

28:26.138 --> 28:29.541
Both of you have grown up
a lot over the years.

28:29.575 --> 28:32.144
-And a boy needs his mama.
-CHRISTOPHER: Daddy?

28:33.445 --> 28:35.882
(growls)

28:35.915 --> 28:38.918
You know what, you're so cute,
I could just rip you to shreds.

28:38.951 --> 28:41.387
-(both growling)
-(Carla laughing)

28:41.420 --> 28:43.289
*

28:54.600 --> 28:56.035
What's his name?

28:56.068 --> 28:57.269
Hey.
This is City Slicker.

28:57.303 --> 28:58.905
He's a quarter horse.

28:58.938 --> 29:01.107
-Do you get to keep him?
-No, he belongs to the police,

29:01.140 --> 29:03.375
but I get to take care of him
and I train him

29:03.409 --> 29:04.777
on how to be
a good police horse.

29:07.814 --> 29:10.149
Would you like
to feed him some apple?

29:22.028 --> 29:23.329
(screaming)

29:23.362 --> 29:25.998
-(neighing)
-Whoa...

29:26.032 --> 29:28.167
Whoa!

29:40.479 --> 29:43.315
MAN:
...got burned all over his face!

29:43.349 --> 29:45.517
WOMAN:
There's a horse running,
and he looks really spooked!

29:45.551 --> 29:47.519
POLICE OFFICER:
Officer down. Repeat,
we have an officer down.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.755
Requesting immediate assistance.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.690
*

29:55.061 --> 29:57.129
(low grunting)

29:57.163 --> 29:59.165
DAN:
Easy, City.

29:59.198 --> 30:00.867
He never gets spooked.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.435
It was too many things at once.

30:03.469 --> 30:05.371
I don't know if the air splint
will fit his leg. I...

30:05.404 --> 30:07.673
You know, may-maybe I can try
and rig something.

30:07.706 --> 30:09.541
It's not just his leg.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.310
CHIMNEY:
Should I radio
for Animal Services?

30:11.343 --> 30:13.512
It's gonna take them an hour
to get here.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.515
-He's in pain.
-Maybe the-the vet can fix it.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.384
HEN:
Horses are very prone
to infection.

30:18.417 --> 30:21.720
Their intestines don't
respond well to antibiotics.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.455
It's almost impossible
for the immune response

30:23.489 --> 30:24.991
to work effectively.

30:25.024 --> 30:27.559
-How much does he weigh?
-About a thousand pounds.

30:27.593 --> 30:28.961
We don't have
enough barbiturates

30:28.995 --> 30:30.897
on the truck to get it done.

30:30.930 --> 30:33.632
-He would need a sedative first.
-Get it done?

30:33.665 --> 30:35.167
Otherwise he would
just thrash around like crazy

30:35.201 --> 30:37.169
-till his heart gave out.
-Are you sure

30:37.203 --> 30:38.570
you want to do this?

30:38.604 --> 30:41.007
We-we could...
we could try other things.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.708
We both know they won't work.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.978
He's a good boy.

30:46.012 --> 30:47.679
I just don't
want him to suffer anymore.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.682
(City Slicker groans)

30:52.051 --> 30:53.719
(sniffles)
It's okay, bud.

30:53.752 --> 30:56.188
It's okay.

30:56.222 --> 30:59.158
HEN:
Administering sedative.

30:59.191 --> 31:02.394
-(whinnying)
-Thank you, buddy.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.163
Thank you
for keeping me company.

31:04.196 --> 31:06.332
Thank you for keeping me safe.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.900
Now you're gonna
go to sleep, okay?

31:07.934 --> 31:10.102
When you wake up,
you're gonna be

31:10.136 --> 31:12.271
in a field of sage,
and you can just run forever.

31:12.304 --> 31:15.874
But you don't have to stay
and watch anymore.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.177
You don't have to be strong

31:18.210 --> 31:19.611
or calm or brave.

31:19.645 --> 31:21.413
You can just be free.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.049
(City Slicker groans)

31:23.082 --> 31:24.917
Just be a horse again.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.718
Morphine.

31:34.293 --> 31:35.861
(whispers):
Bobby?

31:35.894 --> 31:38.064
You want me to do it, Hen?

31:38.097 --> 31:40.599
No, I got it.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.476
(sighs)

31:54.146 --> 31:55.814
Hen.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.168
(sighs)

32:30.983 --> 32:32.884
*

32:52.338 --> 32:53.739
(Dan sniffling)

33:00.812 --> 33:02.714
He's my friend.

33:04.883 --> 33:06.318
He's my friend.

33:17.729 --> 33:19.665
(kids chattering)

33:27.739 --> 33:29.908
-(sighs)
-GIRL: Trick or treat!

33:32.111 --> 33:34.080
(knocking)

33:34.113 --> 33:37.249
Alana Perez?

33:37.283 --> 33:40.252
I'm Sergeant Grant.
I'm here about Alex.

33:53.799 --> 33:55.767
ALANA:
When?

33:55.801 --> 33:58.070
We identified his remains
yesterday.

33:58.104 --> 34:00.106
But it'd been awhile.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.807
Seven years.

34:03.942 --> 34:07.045
I saw your
missing persons report.

34:07.079 --> 34:10.882
They kept trying to tell me
he'd run out on me.

34:10.916 --> 34:14.720
That he'd gone back
to his old life.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.756
I'd get so...

34:17.789 --> 34:19.691
mad.

34:19.725 --> 34:24.130
Not that nobody believed me...

34:24.163 --> 34:27.099
but that nobody believed in him.

34:27.133 --> 34:28.567
There was no evidence

34:28.600 --> 34:31.069
of foul play.

34:31.103 --> 34:34.773
It looks he was just hiking
and the...

34:34.806 --> 34:38.610
the road washed out
beneath his feet.

34:38.644 --> 34:40.246
The medical examiner

34:40.279 --> 34:43.182
will contact you
about his remains.

34:50.156 --> 34:53.525
In the meantime, I-I thought
you might like to have this.

35:03.635 --> 35:05.837
Mami, Mami, can we go now?

35:05.871 --> 35:08.440
Yes, baby,
of course. Just a minute.

35:08.474 --> 35:10.342
Just a minute.

35:18.150 --> 35:21.987
Thank you.
Thank you.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.529
Well, thank you for coming by,
Mrs. Diaz. It was a pleasure

35:30.562 --> 35:31.797
-to meet you.
-You, too. Thank you.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.633
You're welcome.
Have a good day.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.304
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:38.337 --> 35:41.507
School called to tell me
about your appointment.

35:41.540 --> 35:43.642
-Thought I'd head over.
-Well, don't worry.

35:43.675 --> 35:45.611
I didn't tank
the interview, okay?

35:45.644 --> 35:48.046
-Least, I don't think I did.
-I'm sure you did great.

35:48.079 --> 35:49.381
I appreciate it.
Christopher will, too.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.682
That's why you're here--

35:50.716 --> 35:52.651
to pass along thank-yous
from my own son?

35:57.589 --> 36:00.025
When you left...

36:00.058 --> 36:02.694
I understood.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.696
I tried to.

36:04.730 --> 36:06.365
And you were taking care
of your mother,

36:06.398 --> 36:08.534
and I was trying to take care
of Christopher, and...

36:08.567 --> 36:11.803
and we-we just drifted
further away from each other.

36:11.837 --> 36:14.540
But I always thought
you'd come home.

36:14.573 --> 36:17.543
Maybe we'd have a chance
to make things right.

36:17.576 --> 36:20.512
But you didn't.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.180
So I guess I-I just...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.516
I need to know.

36:24.550 --> 36:26.518
Why?

36:26.552 --> 36:29.154
I didn't know how.

36:29.187 --> 36:33.091
I mean, the longer I was gone,
the harder it was to come back.

36:33.124 --> 36:36.094
To face you.
And to face Christopher and...

36:36.127 --> 36:38.997
He must hate me.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.267
What are you talking about?
Why would Christopher hate you?

36:41.300 --> 36:43.402
Because I did this to him.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.505
I have relived every moment

36:46.538 --> 36:49.408
of that pregnancy so many times,

36:49.441 --> 36:51.510
just trying to figure out

36:51.543 --> 36:54.280
how it happened, and...

36:54.313 --> 36:56.348
what I did wrong.

36:56.382 --> 36:59.017
And I thought
I could make up for it,

36:59.050 --> 37:01.019
so I did all this research,

37:01.052 --> 37:03.622
finding new treatments
and different therapies.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.692
But it was all still
so overwhelming and exhausting,

37:06.725 --> 37:08.627
and I just...

37:08.660 --> 37:11.630
needed a break.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.866
So then the mother
who hurt her kid left him.

37:14.900 --> 37:17.469
I'm sorry.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.807
You didn't do anything wrong.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.943
What happened...

37:24.976 --> 37:26.378
wasn't your fault.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.281
(sniffles)
I... I know that.

37:29.315 --> 37:31.583
I just...

37:31.617 --> 37:33.752
I don't feel it.

37:38.524 --> 37:41.092
Christopher loves you.

37:41.126 --> 37:44.330
-(chuckles softly)
-And he misses you.

37:51.470 --> 37:53.439
I miss you.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.374
I missed you.

38:15.794 --> 38:17.696
*

38:32.310 --> 38:34.212
Everyone in my life--

38:34.245 --> 38:36.615
my sister, the team--

38:36.648 --> 38:38.684
they're on my side.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.953
Now, what I really need
right now

38:41.987 --> 38:45.357
is to talk to someone
on Abby's side.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.659
-Okay, Buck, you know
I don't do sides.
-But you know...

38:47.693 --> 38:50.396
-I love both of you.
-Yeah, but you know her.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.998
All right, honestly, maybe
even better than I do right now.

38:53.031 --> 38:56.368
I, uh, haven't
spoken to her in weeks.

38:56.402 --> 38:59.838
The gap between talks
keeps getting longer,

38:59.871 --> 39:02.574
and the conversations shorter.

39:02.608 --> 39:05.076
There's this...
this voice in my head

39:05.110 --> 39:08.747
keeps on saying...

39:08.780 --> 39:11.249
"Move on, Buck.

39:11.282 --> 39:13.251
She's never gonna come back."

39:13.284 --> 39:15.587
She still cares about you.

39:15.621 --> 39:18.590
She's just not ready
to come home yet.

39:18.624 --> 39:20.859
At least not to this one.

39:22.961 --> 39:25.196
-Wait, what does that mean?
-Her brother's

39:25.230 --> 39:26.432
been after her, you know,

39:26.465 --> 39:28.266
to come stay with them
for a bit.

39:28.299 --> 39:30.536
And truthfully,
I think it'll be good for her.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.704
I mean, she needs to go
and dip her toe

39:32.738 --> 39:34.706
in the real world.

39:34.740 --> 39:37.242
So, you know,
she doesn't have a fear

39:37.275 --> 39:39.778
of being pulled under
by all of these memories.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.747
Yeah, tell me about it.

39:43.314 --> 39:47.085
Everything in this place
is hers.

39:47.118 --> 39:50.756
She feels less and less
a part of it every day.

39:50.789 --> 39:52.958
See, this-this whole time,
I-I felt

39:52.991 --> 39:56.462
like I was being haunted
by this memory of her, but...

39:56.495 --> 39:58.630
but maybe I'm the ghost.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.700
Lingering here when...

40:01.733 --> 40:04.636
when I should've moved on
a long time ago.

40:09.475 --> 40:12.077
You probably didn't know this,

40:12.110 --> 40:15.547
but when I was a little kid,

40:15.581 --> 40:17.916
I used to write you letters.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.585
Mom said
that we would mail them off

40:19.618 --> 40:21.753
as soon as we got
your new address.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.322
That never happened,
but I kept writing.

40:24.355 --> 40:28.293
I wrote
about my Cabbage Patch dolls.

40:30.128 --> 40:33.932
And the day I got inducted
into the National Honor Society.

40:36.635 --> 40:39.905
And that moment...

40:39.938 --> 40:43.642
I saw my best friend and I...

40:43.675 --> 40:46.678
I realized I wanted to kiss her.

40:46.712 --> 40:50.916
You became like my diary.

40:50.949 --> 40:55.320
Confessions
to an imaginary daddy.

40:55.353 --> 40:58.456
I don't know
what you would've wanted,

40:58.490 --> 41:00.391
'cause I don't know you.

41:02.494 --> 41:05.396
I can only go off
of what I would want.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.635
And I wouldn't want
to live like this.

41:11.670 --> 41:14.573
Some ghost in a hospital bed.

41:21.547 --> 41:24.482
So I'm gonna forgive you, Dad.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.388
And let you...

41:33.158 --> 41:36.061
...and let you go.

41:38.196 --> 41:42.734
* And I'll use you
as a warning sign... *

41:42.768 --> 41:46.004
BUCK:
We are all haunted.

41:46.037 --> 41:47.673
* Enough sense,
then you'll lose your mind... *

41:47.706 --> 41:49.040
By the ones we've loved

41:49.074 --> 41:52.377
and the ones we've lost.

41:52.410 --> 41:55.914
* And I'll use you
as a focal point... *

41:58.283 --> 42:00.485
By the choices we've made

42:00.518 --> 42:04.522
and the ones
we still struggle with.

42:04.556 --> 42:07.192
* And I've moved further... *

42:07.225 --> 42:10.996
Our lives are like
a series of ghost stories.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.164
* But I missed you more

42:13.198 --> 42:16.201
* Than I thought I would

42:18.303 --> 42:23.274
* And I'll use you
as a warning sign... *

42:23.308 --> 42:26.912
Sometimes all we can do
is turn the page.

42:26.945 --> 42:29.748
Let go.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.249
(monitor flatlines)

42:31.282 --> 42:35.220
* And I found love

42:35.253 --> 42:39.658
* Where it wasn't
supposed to be... *

42:40.992 --> 42:42.861
That's what I need to do now.

42:42.894 --> 42:45.530
I'm not sure
if you'll ever come back

42:45.563 --> 42:47.899
or how I'll feel if you do,

42:47.933 --> 42:51.469
but I am sure
that I cannot wait anymore.

42:51.502 --> 42:55.206
You are my ghost story, Abby.

42:55.240 --> 42:58.610
You are the amazing spirit

42:58.644 --> 43:01.613
that blew into my life,
turned it upside down,

43:01.647 --> 43:04.916
and then vanished
into the night.

43:04.950 --> 43:07.753
Being with you
made me a better man,

43:07.786 --> 43:10.989
and for that
I will always love you.

43:12.758 --> 43:15.326
Now it's time

43:15.360 --> 43:19.297
for me to figure out who I am

43:19.330 --> 43:21.767
without you.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.943
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

44:13.685 --> 44:15.987
You've answered the call
on 9-1-1.

44:16.021 --> 44:18.256
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:20.658 --> 44:21.860
Buckle up, buttercup.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.531
It's real, and it pulls
people together.

44:26.564 --> 44:30.135
-* We're breaking waves
shooting star *
-(siren wailing)

44:30.168 --> 44:33.705
* We live for glory
not forever *

44:33.739 --> 44:34.740
MAN: Touchdown!

44:34.773 --> 44:38.343
* Reach out *

44:38.376 --> 44:41.980
* Make this right here
right now *

44:42.013 --> 44:44.916
* Stand up *

44:45.784 --> 44:47.552
* Here right now *

44:47.585 --> 44:49.554
That sounds like fun.
