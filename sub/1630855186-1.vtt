00:11.199 --> 00:13.000
Final call for Flight 38 to...

00:13.000 --> 00:15.400
Keep working on Ceaușescu's painting.

00:16.480 --> 00:19.879
I've, um...
I've hung his picture in your room.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.679
- Could come in handy.
- Okay.

00:29.559 --> 00:30.800
Bye, Daddy.

00:39.399 --> 00:40.880
[pensive music playing]

00:51.039 --> 00:52.280
Bye.

[man on PA]
The train to Mainz is at the platform

02:04.079 --> 02:06.719
and will be departing in ten minutes.

02:06.719 --> 02:10.080
<i>The train will be stopping
in Bonn, Remagen,</i>

02:10.080 --> 02:13.360
<i>Andernach, Koblenz,
Bingen, and Mainz.</i>

02:16.240 --> 02:18.879
<i>Please make sure
to have your tickets out.</i>

02:18.879 --> 02:21.919
<i>We will be walking by
to collect them shortly.</i>

02:45.719 --> 02:50.360
Victor Godeanu. And your reason
for visiting the embassy?

02:50.360 --> 02:55.080
I'm from Romanian Intelligence.
I'm here to speak to Frank Jackson.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.159
I'm not gonna fudge
the numbers for this.

02:57.159 --> 03:00.800
I'll call Langley and tell them our
sources informed us the KGB

03:00.800 --> 03:03.360
just received
over a hundred new transmitters,

03:03.360 --> 03:04.919
and we need to have them too.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.360
[knock on door]

03:08.560 --> 03:11.599
[John] Sorry, Frank. Someone
in the lobby wants to see you.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.120
[Ingrid] ...to help those
less fortunate, especially kids.

03:19.120 --> 03:21.800
We're really looking forward
to this conference.

03:21.800 --> 03:23.360
It's great you're hosting it.

03:26.199 --> 03:28.960
- Sure it's Victor Godeanu?
- That's what the lady said.

03:43.039 --> 03:45.319
- Where's the Romanian guy?
- He left, sir.

04:04.639 --> 04:07.280
Um, the Grand Cologne Hotel.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.280
[Frank] You sure that's him?

04:13.840 --> 04:15.719
That's him, 100 percent.

04:16.480 --> 04:18.079
Thanks. You can go.

04:22.639 --> 04:24.120
Damn. That was really him.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.959
What could someone from
Romanian Intelligence want with us?

04:26.959 --> 04:28.800
He's not just someone.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.079
He's the personal security advisor
of Nicolae Ceaușescu

04:31.079 --> 04:34.399
and deputy chief of Romania's
foreign intelligence service.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.399
Sources say he runs the place.

04:37.079 --> 04:40.439
If he used his real name, that means
he wanted us to know who he is.

04:40.439 --> 04:43.439
Why the fuck would he wanna speak
with me? I never even met the guy.

04:45.759 --> 04:47.439
Maybe he wants a job.

04:50.439 --> 04:51.959
Or start a conversation.

04:54.560 --> 04:56.079
We need to find him.

04:56.079 --> 04:57.560
[theme music playing]

06:41.680 --> 06:43.639
[Elena] Victor, you look like shit.

06:43.639 --> 06:46.600
What is that actress wife
of yours doing to you?

06:47.720 --> 06:49.319
I ask myself that a lot.

06:49.959 --> 06:53.240
I told you,
she only cares about herself

06:53.240 --> 06:55.720
and about her appearance, that's it.

07:18.279 --> 07:23.120
Long live Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu!
Comrade Elena Ceaușescu!

07:28.839 --> 07:30.839
Nicolae seems troubled.

07:30.839 --> 07:32.160
No. He's fine.

07:32.839 --> 07:34.639
You know how he gets occasionally.

07:35.879 --> 07:37.360
Anything I can help with?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.560
You're helping a lot already.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.879
Oh, I forgot.
We both really loved our gifts.

07:43.439 --> 07:45.720
That mink fur
was so thoughtful, Victor.

07:48.160 --> 07:50.959
<i>[man on TV] ...the president
of the United States of America</i>

07:50.959 --> 07:53.000
and Nicolae Ceaușescu...

07:53.000 --> 07:56.079
I'm taller than he is.
They must have altered the picture.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.319
Have some peanuts.

08:04.079 --> 08:05.639
Go on. Enjoy.

08:05.639 --> 08:08.120
We've paid Billy Carter
a fortune for them.

08:11.040 --> 08:12.639
Americans are such peasants.

08:12.639 --> 08:14.839
Who elects a peanut farmer
as president?

08:15.519 --> 08:19.199
They didn't convince Sadat
to meet Begin. You did.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.079
Without you, there's no Camp David.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.800
They should give you
the Nobel Prize for what you did.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.680
You're right. They better.

08:32.080 --> 08:34.399
I'm not eating this crap.
I want real food.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.279
[Nicolae] So, what's new?

08:43.360 --> 08:45.799
The Bulgarians
are excited for the concert.

08:45.799 --> 08:47.919
I've run background on the pianist.

08:47.919 --> 08:51.399
Her sister-in-law is married
to a Russian, but he's a civilian.

08:51.399 --> 08:53.000
Nothing to worry about.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.279
Victor, listen.

09:01.639 --> 09:04.720
Lately, I've had the feeling
that I'm surrounded

09:04.720 --> 09:10.000
by spies, saboteurs, and traitors.

09:10.879 --> 09:13.519
Comrade, we're always watching out.

09:15.240 --> 09:16.840
Well, I want you to look again.

09:18.039 --> 09:21.600
I want to take Dan Banea off
the negotiations with West Germany.

09:22.399 --> 09:25.440
He could get the Germans
to pay more for their Swabians.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.919
Instead he agrees to a crappy deal.

09:28.600 --> 09:32.120
He's doing a lousy job
serving Romania's interests.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.440
A lousy job.

09:35.919 --> 09:40.159
You do it. You will go to Bonn
next week and fix the situation.

09:40.159 --> 09:41.720
Of course. It's an honor.

09:45.720 --> 09:48.679
And see if there is a mole
in my inner circle.

09:50.600 --> 09:53.360
Check each and every one of them.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.679
Find the mole.

09:55.480 --> 09:56.720
I swear to God.

09:57.840 --> 10:02.440
I will hang him with my own hands.
Victor, I'll make sure that he pays.

10:07.480 --> 10:08.720
You can trust me.

10:45.759 --> 10:47.000
Hey.

10:47.960 --> 10:50.720
Don't worry.
I'll talk to him and he'll help you.

10:50.720 --> 10:52.639
- Hello, sweetheart.
- Hey, Daddy.

10:53.399 --> 10:56.519
Carla? Is your friend okay?

10:57.240 --> 10:58.519
I'll tell you later.

10:59.399 --> 11:01.799
I'm gonna run upstairs.
I'll be right down.

11:11.679 --> 11:12.919
[door locks]

11:32.320 --> 11:33.799
[ominous music playing]

12:52.600 --> 12:54.399
The passports you asked for.

12:56.159 --> 12:59.879
Your Egyptians can cross
any border as Romanian citizens.

13:01.639 --> 13:02.879
Perfect.

13:07.279 --> 13:11.000
A French agent has the negative from
your meeting with General Shakarov.

13:11.799 --> 13:13.759
Impossible. I destroyed it.

13:13.759 --> 13:15.399
It turns out there's a copy.

13:16.440 --> 13:18.279
And if the French agent has it,

13:19.000 --> 13:22.399
it's likely your counterintelligence
will get a hold of it too.

13:22.399 --> 13:24.320
You're getting too sloppy, Victor.

13:25.519 --> 13:27.279
Perhaps we're paying you too much.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.159
Moscow is worried
you might get caught.

13:31.080 --> 13:34.759
I won't. I know what I am doing.

13:34.759 --> 13:37.440
I have never screwed up in 15 years.

13:38.039 --> 13:40.039
Nor have we.

13:41.919 --> 13:43.840
They're considering taking you out.

13:45.240 --> 13:46.679
To where?

13:47.799 --> 13:49.320
To Moscow.

13:58.279 --> 14:02.000
<i>[Carmen] He's been selling state
secrets to the Russians for years.</i>

14:02.000 --> 14:05.320
<i>[Mircea] I can't take this
to Ceaușescu without evidence.</i>

14:05.960 --> 14:08.200
<i>He'll deny it,
and we'll take the rap.</i>

14:08.799 --> 14:11.240
<i>[Carmen] How did he know
about the operation?</i>

14:11.240 --> 14:15.120
<i>We had him. I'm fed up with this guy.
He has microphones everywhere.</i>

14:15.120 --> 14:19.200
<i>[Mircea] Run another bug sweep.
Search cars, clothes, everything.</i>

14:29.279 --> 14:31.720
What the hell
is counterintelligence doing here?

14:44.279 --> 14:46.519
- Comrade Voinea.
- Comrade Godeanu.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.879
I'd offer you a coffee, but I have
a feeling my boss has already.

14:50.879 --> 14:55.360
Oh, yes. He was very kind.
He's someone I can work well with.

14:55.360 --> 14:58.320
Well, I'm sure you two
will clearly see eye to eye.

14:59.039 --> 15:01.679
Yes. Well, have an excellent day,
Comrade Godeanu.

15:04.720 --> 15:08.080
Ah. Before I forget,
I've left a present for you.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.440
It's in your office.
I hope you like it.

15:22.919 --> 15:24.519
Give me a minute.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.600
- Why are you here?
- It's urgent.

15:30.639 --> 15:33.639
Our source has a copy
of the negative.

15:34.759 --> 15:37.559
We need to pay him
and arrange the transfer in Vienna.

15:39.399 --> 15:40.799
We got him now.

15:40.799 --> 15:42.639
[suspenseful music playing]

15:56.639 --> 15:58.120
[approaching footsteps]

15:58.919 --> 16:00.879
[knocking on door, then door opens]

16:00.879 --> 16:03.960
- Victor. Hello there.
- Banea. How are you?

16:03.960 --> 16:06.919
Have a look at what I brought you.

16:07.519 --> 16:11.600
Ta-da! You have to
come down to the warehouse.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.960
The new cargo is in.

16:13.960 --> 16:18.559
Matter of fact, we have some of
those electric toasters from America.

16:18.559 --> 16:22.600
You know the type that goes "ping"
when it's done. Great stuff.

16:23.200 --> 16:25.440
I might give one of them
to my secretary.

16:26.320 --> 16:30.440
Oh, Banea.
You're always up to no good.

16:31.279 --> 16:34.080
How much alimony
are you willing to pay?

16:34.080 --> 16:37.200
Oh, come on.
What else is all this money for,

16:37.200 --> 16:38.559
if not for spending?

16:39.480 --> 16:42.279
Spending wisely.
Remember our plans?

16:42.279 --> 16:46.320
Yeah. I know, I know.
I didn't forget.

16:46.320 --> 16:48.279
I was just joking around.

16:49.759 --> 16:54.320
Joking? And in Germany,
was that a joke?

16:58.159 --> 16:59.399
What did I do?

17:01.639 --> 17:04.759
It was your time to shine,
and you fucked up instead.

17:06.319 --> 17:08.720
I've been told
to take over the negotiations

17:08.720 --> 17:11.599
for the Pilgrims program.
He wants more money.

17:12.240 --> 17:16.440
Victor. Victor, you know I did
my best, all right? You know that.

17:17.839 --> 17:20.880
It's not my fault the Germans
wouldn't accept our price.

17:20.880 --> 17:22.319
It was way too much anyway.

17:24.839 --> 17:27.039
Okay, I didn't wanna squeeze them.

17:28.799 --> 17:31.160
Those lists are of real people

17:31.160 --> 17:33.880
who are desperate
to reunite with their families.

17:33.880 --> 17:36.359
You're too sensitive for this.
I told you that.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.039
Yeah, you did.

17:44.559 --> 17:46.359
We need to lay low a little.

17:47.839 --> 17:50.400
The comrade's currently
very paranoid.

17:50.400 --> 17:53.359
He thinks traitors and saboteurs
are everywhere.

17:54.359 --> 17:56.279
And he really thinks I'm one of them?

17:57.640 --> 18:00.440
Please get me a meeting.
I'll clear it up, trust me.

18:00.440 --> 18:02.079
All right. Take it easy.

18:03.160 --> 18:04.559
I'll handle it.

18:04.559 --> 18:06.160
[Banea sighs]

18:06.160 --> 18:08.559
- You just stay out of trouble, okay?
- Yeah.

18:08.559 --> 18:11.640
All right, my friend.
I'll keep my head down, I promise.

18:12.720 --> 18:14.200
Whatever you say.

18:15.519 --> 18:16.920
What's the redhead up to?

18:19.200 --> 18:21.880
Tell her to come see me.
I have a job for her.

18:23.279 --> 18:24.519
[chuckles]

18:28.880 --> 18:32.680
[Mircea] He's a smuggler,
controls an extensive network.

18:32.680 --> 18:34.960
[speaking indistinctly]

18:34.960 --> 18:36.839
Our country's image is at stake.

18:36.839 --> 18:40.279
Comrade Godeanu.
Let me introduce myself.

18:40.279 --> 18:41.599
Ioan Albescu.

18:42.160 --> 18:45.960
I was recently appointed deputy
of the Party's Security Committee.

18:46.960 --> 18:51.039
My goal is to keep a watchful eye
on the Intelligence Services.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.200
These are dangerous times.

18:55.640 --> 18:58.640
Glad to see our Party
promotes people like you.

18:59.559 --> 19:03.759
As I told Comrade Voinea,
the Party has my full support.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.119
- [gunshot]
- [bear growling]

19:09.519 --> 19:12.680
Excellent shot,
Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.359
Live long,
President Nicolae Ceaușescu!

19:15.359 --> 19:18.319
- Nice shot, Ceaușescu.
- Comrades, let the hunt begin!

19:18.319 --> 19:21.960
Let the hunt begin!
Well done, Comrade Nicolae Ceaușescu.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.359
Hooray! Let's get those bears.

19:24.359 --> 19:27.680
Go! Bring honor
to the comrade president!

19:27.680 --> 19:30.599
- [men shouting and laughing]
- [dog barking]

19:38.480 --> 19:39.720
[bear growling]

19:40.640 --> 19:41.960
[gun cocking]

20:03.839 --> 20:05.079
Go on.

20:09.799 --> 20:12.680
You'd better run
while there is still time.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.519
[dogs barking in distance]

20:25.160 --> 20:26.400
[Nicolae] Victor.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.640
There you are.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.680
I need you to do something
for your country.

20:39.759 --> 20:41.640
Get rid of a saboteur.

20:42.319 --> 20:44.640
You need to be discreet,
like only you can.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.240
Dan Banea.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.880
I think you were misinformed.

20:54.319 --> 20:57.200
He's a good communist.
The man's loyal.

20:57.200 --> 20:59.960
I heard otherwise.
Anything but loyal.

21:00.559 --> 21:03.160
I gave him too much power.
He took advantage of it.

21:06.160 --> 21:10.799
Listen, you know you can count on me
to investigate anything you ask,

21:10.799 --> 21:14.000
but I don't think
he did anything to deserve--

21:14.000 --> 21:16.839
You cannot
get too close to people, Victor.

21:17.440 --> 21:21.839
I mean, you more than anyone else
should realize that.

21:23.880 --> 21:27.279
I'm just saying it can
completely cloud your thinking.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.200
I want it done by tomorrow morning.

21:33.559 --> 21:34.880
Handle it personally.

21:52.559 --> 21:53.799
[gun cocks]

22:06.880 --> 22:08.400
Sorry I'm late, Victor.

22:11.880 --> 22:13.119
You ready?

22:14.480 --> 22:17.319
- Yes, let's go.
- So, what's with the new warehouse?

[Victor]
You have to hide here for a while.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.319
You don't understand
how serious this is, Banea.

23:00.319 --> 23:04.160
Ceaușescu's got it in his head that
you betrayed the Party's interest.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.640
- I need time to fix that.
- Time? How long?

23:07.640 --> 23:10.920
<i>[Victor] A few weeks.
We'll find an excuse or something.</i>

23:10.920 --> 23:15.119
Victor, look at me.
I'm not a saboteur and you know that.

23:16.839 --> 23:18.400
I know. Yeah.

23:22.079 --> 23:24.960
Then do something.
You've got Ceaușescu's ear.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.759
Make him listen, or I will.

23:56.440 --> 23:58.839
<i>And your reason
for visiting the embassy?</i>

23:58.839 --> 24:03.480
I'm with the Romanian Intelligence.
I'm here to see Frank Jackson.

24:03.480 --> 24:06.240
[Frank] We're not gonna
fudge the numbers for this.

24:07.039 --> 24:10.440
I'll call Langley and tell them
our sources informed us the KGB

24:10.440 --> 24:13.960
received over a hundred new
transmitters, and we need them too.

24:13.960 --> 24:16.839
Sorry, Frank. Someone in the lobby
wants to see you.

24:23.680 --> 24:26.799
[Ingrid] ...to help those
less fortunate, especially kids.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.559
We're really looking forward
to this conference.

24:29.559 --> 24:31.160
It's great you're hosting it.

24:33.759 --> 24:37.720
But the Ministry is also keen
to provide any help you might need.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.200
Anything, really.

26:12.640 --> 26:14.880
What if he's ill?
I've looked everywhere.

26:14.880 --> 26:18.640
We're already late for the meeting. Everywhere.

26:18.640 --> 26:20.039
Of course I did.

26:21.039 --> 26:23.119
- I...
- Are you ready?

26:24.160 --> 26:26.279
Never mind. He's here. It's okay.

26:30.119 --> 26:31.960
I told you we'd be on time.

26:33.519 --> 26:35.920
Sorry, Comrade Godeanu.
I was worried.

26:36.839 --> 26:39.039
I have to log deviations
from the schedule.

26:39.880 --> 26:41.599
But we are on schedule.

26:43.119 --> 26:45.440
So we don't have a problem, correct?

26:46.720 --> 26:47.960
Correct.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.440
<i>[Klaus] Our aim is to bring
as many Transylvanian Germans</i>

26:56.440 --> 26:59.279
<i>back from Romania
as possible, Mr. Godeanu.</i>

26:59.279 --> 27:02.200
<i>[Victor] I understand,
and terms can be adjusted.</i>

27:03.000 --> 27:08.119
However, my mandate is to accept
only 200 Germans, not one more.

27:09.000 --> 27:12.440
I'm positive we can reach
a mutually favorable deal.

27:13.880 --> 27:15.599
[Ingrid] Sorry for being late.

27:15.599 --> 27:17.759
[Klaus] I asked
Ingrid von Weizendorff

27:17.759 --> 27:20.440
from Eastern European Affairs
to join us.

27:20.440 --> 27:21.920
She has the revised list

27:21.920 --> 27:24.519
of German-Romanians
for our Pilgrims program.

27:24.519 --> 27:26.200
Good morning, Mr. Godeanu.

27:26.200 --> 27:28.160
Good morning, Mr. Rancea.

27:29.240 --> 27:31.319
Here is our updated list.

27:34.640 --> 27:35.880
And one for you.

27:37.720 --> 27:39.640
- Here you go.
- [Klaus] Thank you.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.759
There are 20 more names on this list.

27:43.759 --> 27:46.160
This is not what we agreed on.

27:46.160 --> 27:48.319
Yes, we are aware of that.

27:48.319 --> 27:51.640
But family is a very important value
for the Bundesrepublik.

27:51.640 --> 27:55.160
And I'm sure for
President Nicolae Ceaușescu as well.

27:55.160 --> 27:58.359
Family is one thing.
Making sure the people on this list

27:58.359 --> 28:01.440
are eligible for the Pilgrim program
is another.

28:01.440 --> 28:04.279
We are ready to offer
the Romanian government

28:04.279 --> 28:06.960
3 million Deutsche Mark
to close this deal.

28:12.960 --> 28:14.920
I have to reconsider your offer.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.680
We shall resume negotiations tomorrow.

28:23.440 --> 28:26.279
How long are you staying
in Bonn, Mr. Godeanu?

28:26.279 --> 28:28.160
As long as we need.

Someone he knows well.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.279
I want you to triple check
each name on this visitor's list,

28:55.279 --> 28:58.039
no matter how innocent it looks.
Okay?

I am.

I love it.

32:01.640 --> 32:03.839
Welcome, General Godeanu.

32:04.799 --> 32:06.119
Hello, Mr. Jackson.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.640
Whyte & Mackay?

32:21.799 --> 32:24.599
- 1966.
- My favorite.

32:25.359 --> 32:26.759
Can I get you a glass?

32:26.759 --> 32:29.200
Let's share it when I'm on
the other side of history.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.759
Are you saying you want to defect?

32:38.480 --> 32:41.359
- Yes.
- Who knows you're here?

32:41.359 --> 32:44.400
- Nobody.
- Not Adela?

32:44.400 --> 32:45.720
Not Ileana?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.599
Would you tell your wife Delilah
if you were me?

32:52.200 --> 32:53.880
Hard to say.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.039
But I'd try to make sure
she was safe.

32:56.039 --> 32:58.599
I'm confident that after I tell you
everything I know,

32:58.599 --> 33:00.720
you'll bring them over
to the United States.

33:00.720 --> 33:04.519
I'll do everything in my power,
but first, let's get you there.

33:04.519 --> 33:06.960
Defection's not an easy process.

33:08.279 --> 33:10.599
I have to follow protocol.

33:10.599 --> 33:14.240
- Get my superior's okay.
- Your protocols better be quick.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.720
You know the risks.

33:15.720 --> 33:18.160
As soon as Ceaușescu finds out,
I'm dead.

33:19.000 --> 33:22.519
I will do my best
to have you cross to the other side.

33:22.519 --> 33:26.079
You do your best
to stay safe until then.

33:28.759 --> 33:30.119
Come back tomorrow at noon.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.559
- I'll have it sorted by then.
- You better.

33:38.200 --> 33:40.759
My direct number in case you need it.

33:47.119 --> 33:49.119
Oh, General Godeanu,
just out of curiosity,

33:49.119 --> 33:51.279
why did you run
out of the embassy today?

without my approval.

44:14.199 --> 44:16.360
I look like an idiot
because I hadn't a clue.

44:16.360 --> 44:18.079
If you'd been around,
you'd have known.

44:18.079 --> 44:19.559
I was busy.

44:19.559 --> 44:21.679
We need to find a way to get Godeanu.

44:21.679 --> 44:23.760
- Langley said no.
- Then convince them.

44:24.840 --> 44:27.800
Don't tell me how to do my job.

Õ I feel I'm going crazy, baby Õ

<i>Õ And that is all
That's left to say Õ</i>

46:26.239 --> 46:29.440
Õ Saddest part is that I'm ready Õ

46:31.719 --> 46:35.599
Õ To leave our home behind to die Õ

46:36.400 --> 46:40.079
<i>Õ Embracing shadows
Of the moonlight Õ</i>

46:42.119 --> 46:46.079

Õ At least I feel alive now Õ

<i>Õ But, baby, havens close
Bridges burn one by one Õ</i>

47:04.280 --> 47:07.400

Fading off one by one Õ</i>

Õ 'Cause I'm a free man fallin' Õ

47:25.159 --> 47:27.440
Õ I'm a free man falling now Õ

47:29.800 --> 47:32.280
Õ Yeah, I'm a free man fallin' Õ

47:36.400 --> 47:38.800
Õ A free man falling now Õ
