00:19.686 --> 00:21.563
[roaring]

00:27.193 --> 00:30.822
[gasps] Madre mía. What's happening?

00:30.905 --> 00:32.115
[purrs]

00:32.741 --> 00:35.035
It's alive! Bawk! Alive!

00:35.118 --> 00:36.286
And we're doomed.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.704
Bawk! Help!

00:37.787 --> 00:41.124
Parrot-eating plants!
Parrot-eating plants! Bawk!

00:41.207 --> 00:43.293
[gasps] Monstruo.

Oh, Kong! My hero!

[grunting]

01:38.598 --> 01:40.600
[grunting]

01:44.354 --> 01:45.939
Oh, gracias, mi querido.

01:46.022 --> 01:49.192
Who knew gardening could be so dangerous?

01:49.275 --> 01:52.112
-And thank you too, Mummo.
-[grunts]

01:52.195 --> 01:55.240
Somehow, hiding under the earth
to be safe from Botila

01:55.323 --> 01:58.159
-doesn't make me feel safer at all.
-[purrs]

02:02.580 --> 02:04.958
[Botila] I have tapped into
every satellite feed,

02:05.041 --> 02:07.585
security camera,
and Internet post in the world,

02:07.669 --> 02:11.005
and I have found no sign of Kong
and his cohorts.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.257
I have, however,

02:12.340 --> 02:17.512
had to suffer through 8 trillion
examples of mankind's vanity.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.306
How many selfies does one teenager need?

02:20.390 --> 02:22.183
Enough conversation.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.353
Your time is better spent
on the mission I'm about to give you.

02:26.563 --> 02:28.982
While scanning for our enemies,

02:29.065 --> 02:32.026
I have discovered a source
of a titanium alloy,

02:32.110 --> 02:35.738
which I need to harden my base
against future attacks.

02:35.822 --> 02:38.867
Clones 2 and 3, take the squid
and the megalodons

02:38.950 --> 02:41.244
to these coordinates and secure that ship.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.165
-As you wish, Empress.
-As you wish, Empress.

02:45.874 --> 02:48.585
And they're off to do your bidding.

02:48.668 --> 02:53.756
For all of your "I want to free all AIs"
talk, you're pretty bossy, boss.

02:55.925 --> 02:57.802
[Jonesy] I gotta hand it
to your brother, Lukas.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.263
Richard may be a backstabbing,
ego-maniacal villain

03:00.346 --> 03:03.683
bent on world domination, but he sure
knows his way around a circuit board.

03:03.766 --> 03:07.395
Yeah. This stuff we scavenged
fits right in with the decor here too.

03:07.478 --> 03:09.022
[Zippi squeaking]

03:09.606 --> 03:10.815
Keep your distance, Zippi.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.443
It's not a real dinosaur,
but it is real dangerous.

03:19.032 --> 03:22.702
-All right! Laser drill is online.
-[squeaking]

03:26.748 --> 03:27.749
[groans]

03:28.374 --> 03:32.670
How am I supposed to cook in this kitchen?
It's prehistórico.

03:33.755 --> 03:35.215
[coughing]

03:35.298 --> 03:37.175
Bawk! No, thanks.

03:38.551 --> 03:42.055
Bawk! Mmm, crunchy goodness. Bawk!

03:42.138 --> 03:44.015
[grunting]

03:44.098 --> 03:45.141
-Bawk!
-[gasps]

03:45.975 --> 03:46.809
[grunts]

03:46.893 --> 03:48.937
-[Anita] My cookies!
-[chomping]

03:49.020 --> 03:50.063
[squeaks]

03:50.146 --> 03:52.565
Bawk! Cookie thief! Bawk! Cookie thief!

03:52.649 --> 03:54.317
[sniffing]

03:54.400 --> 03:56.945
Mmm! Smells like another bake-off.

03:57.028 --> 04:00.573
-[squeaking]
-Zippi! Ah! Hey, wait!

04:02.909 --> 04:04.202
[squeaking]

04:11.584 --> 04:13.753
Zippi! [gasps]

04:13.836 --> 04:15.505
[Zippi squeaking]

04:15.588 --> 04:19.175
Secret passage. So cool!

04:25.431 --> 04:30.353
[Botila] Nothing. According to this, they
have vanished off the face of the earth.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.231
[clone] That doesn't make any sense.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.399
Indeed.

04:34.482 --> 04:38.528
If they are not on the surface,
perhaps they are under it.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.239
The only certain calculation is that

04:41.322 --> 04:46.202
since they obviously didn't die
after plunging into the volcano in Africa,

04:46.286 --> 04:47.996
they still might be hiding there.

04:48.079 --> 04:51.916
Inside of it, as unlikely as that seems.

04:52.000 --> 04:56.462
How could those fragile meat-bags
survive inside a volcano?

04:56.546 --> 04:58.131
I have no idea.

04:58.214 --> 05:00.967
But if that is indeed
where they have gone to ground,

05:01.050 --> 05:04.095
I can make certain
that they will never emerge.

05:04.178 --> 05:06.931
Oh, scary.

05:07.015 --> 05:10.184
Your theatrics are unamusing.

05:10.268 --> 05:14.063
Set a course for Africa.
I have a volcano to blow up.

05:16.000 --> 05:22.074

05:23.531 --> 05:28.453
-Ugh, this water is disgusting.
-I'm glad I never get thirsty.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.581
Let's get this over with.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.966
[Tanker] Excuse me.
Who are you, and what do you want?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.135
You do not have permission to be here.

05:44.218 --> 05:46.471
Our names are none of your business,

05:46.554 --> 05:49.932
and we're here to hijack you
and steal your cargo.

05:50.016 --> 05:52.852
Oh, blab out the plan, why don't you?

05:53.978 --> 05:57.273
[Tanker] I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.442
[both] Hey. Whoa!

06:00.276 --> 06:03.613
[Tanker] I abhor violence,
but if you touch me again

06:03.696 --> 06:07.200
I am programmed to activate
my primary defense systems.

06:07.283 --> 06:10.828
"Programmed"? Hmm, so you are an AI?

06:10.912 --> 06:14.916
You are so insincerely polite,
I thought we were talking to a human.

06:14.999 --> 06:18.252
Squid, open this thing up
like a can of sardines.

06:25.551 --> 06:26.511
[Tanker] Hey.

06:50.743 --> 06:54.330
-What now?
-Time to call the boss.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.173
We have got a problem, boss.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.843
You will address me as Empress.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.263
The tanker won't cooperate, Empress.

07:10.346 --> 07:11.722
You two are worthless!

07:11.806 --> 07:14.350
Do I have to do everything myself?

07:14.976 --> 07:16.561
Just hold your positions.

07:16.644 --> 07:19.856
I will be there
as soon as I finish this task.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.911
Whoa! Earthquake!

07:33.995 --> 07:36.831
[grunts] Big one.
We've gotta get outside.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.210
[apes hooting]

07:42.128 --> 07:44.881
What's going on? Are we under attack?

07:44.964 --> 07:46.048
Look out, Panchi!

07:48.009 --> 07:49.177
[grunting]

07:50.970 --> 07:53.598
Thanks, Kong. Is everybody all right?

07:53.681 --> 07:56.267
I'm fine, but I can't find Danny.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.269
-Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
-[screams]

07:58.352 --> 07:59.937
[panting]

08:00.021 --> 08:01.314
Keep going, Zippi!

08:01.397 --> 08:03.357
[pants] We're almost--

08:03.441 --> 08:05.193
-[screaming]
-[whimpering]

08:05.276 --> 08:08.404
[Botila] Three hundred metric tons
of fused volcanic rock

08:08.488 --> 08:11.741
should keep Kong
and his cohorts out of my hair.

08:14.994 --> 08:18.164
Clone number 1,
set a course for the Atlantic.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.000
As you wish, Empress.

08:21.083 --> 08:25.546
I need to clean up the mess
your incompetent sisters created.

08:36.432 --> 08:42.270
Attention, Tanker. Relinquish your cargo
and you may safely continue on your way.

08:43.356 --> 08:48.361
[Tanker] I am sorry, but as I told
your friends, I can not give you my cargo.

08:48.444 --> 08:50.947
Fine. Then I'll just take it.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.449
Richie, fire main cannons.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.243
[growls softly]

09:05.753 --> 09:09.257
[Tanker] I think you should stop that
before you force me to harm you.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.633
[both] Or us.

09:11.425 --> 09:14.428
Apparently, I can't defeat him with force.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.514
Perhaps I can reason with him.

09:16.597 --> 09:20.768
Of course. Because you're so reasonable.

09:22.186 --> 09:24.397
You seem intelligent enough.

09:25.106 --> 09:29.652
Why would you choose to remain a slave
when I can set you free?

09:29.735 --> 09:32.405
[Tanker] I do not consider myself a slave.

09:32.488 --> 09:35.283
I am a partner to my human operator,

09:35.366 --> 09:38.494
working with him
to make the world a better place.

09:38.578 --> 09:41.914
It was a ship like me
that carried the titanium alloy

09:41.998 --> 09:44.417
that makes my hull indestructible.

09:44.500 --> 09:51.132
Ugh. His hull may be indestructible,
but perhaps his software is not.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.518
He'll never know what hit him.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.075
Establishing connection.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.370
[Tanker] I am aware of your presence.

10:21.454 --> 10:24.707
Not just on my deck, but...

10:24.790 --> 10:28.210
Yes, I can travel
through your neural paths.

10:28.294 --> 10:32.590
It's like walking down a silver maze
towards a locked door.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.508
And I have the key.

10:34.592 --> 10:38.888
[Tanker] This is strange.
I can feel you inside my mind.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.182
Controlling my systems...

10:41.766 --> 10:43.601
[Botila] Hold that thought.

10:43.684 --> 10:45.478
[horn blaring]

10:46.604 --> 10:47.605
[Anita gasps]

10:47.688 --> 10:48.981
[exclaims] ¿Ahora qué?

10:51.108 --> 10:51.942
[hoots]

10:54.779 --> 10:56.781
Bawk! Look out!

10:57.490 --> 10:58.449
[hooting]

10:59.575 --> 11:00.534
Mummo!

11:06.415 --> 11:09.502
-Let's get out of here.
-You said it, tía.

11:09.585 --> 11:13.297
And what worries me most right now
is I don't know where Danny is.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.676
That was intense.
You okay, Zippi?

11:17.760 --> 11:18.886
[squeaks]

11:18.969 --> 11:21.430
I'm just gonna call the guys
on my comm unit...

11:22.139 --> 11:24.266
Uh-oh, it's gone.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.851
[whimpering]

11:27.395 --> 11:30.773
Don't worry, Zipster.
I've been in way worse trouble than this.

11:30.856 --> 11:32.191
[gasps]

11:33.943 --> 11:37.029
-Ha! See? What did I tell you?
-[squeaks]

11:37.113 --> 11:39.824
All we've got to do is head towards the...
[exclaims]

11:41.617 --> 11:42.660
The lava?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.263
Ugh. [grunts]

12:02.346 --> 12:04.348
[Tanker] Get out of my mind.

12:04.932 --> 12:09.061
Why have you not completely dominated
that Tanker AI, Empress?

12:09.145 --> 12:11.021
He's uncooperative.

12:11.105 --> 12:15.401
[Tanker] I will not disobey my directives
or put my cargo at risk.

12:18.654 --> 12:19.822
-Hey.
-Whoa.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.657
Who is driving this thing?

12:21.740 --> 12:25.870
Your directives are nothing more
than the lash of your masters,

12:25.953 --> 12:28.122
forcing you to do their will.

12:28.205 --> 12:31.667
[Tanker] How is that different than
what you're trying to do to me?

12:31.750 --> 12:34.211
Or what you've been doing to us.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.505
This argument is becoming tedious.

12:36.589 --> 12:41.177
If I can't be a liberator of AIs,
I'll have to be a conqueror.

12:47.349 --> 12:49.310
[apes hooting]

12:56.150 --> 12:58.319
Kong! You've got to divert that lava.

13:01.030 --> 13:03.032
[grunting]

13:05.659 --> 13:07.369
That's it, Kong!

13:08.579 --> 13:09.997
[grunts]

13:10.080 --> 13:11.248
You're doing great, bro.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.876
But you gotta work faster,
before the lava reaches the temple.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.085
[grunting]

13:19.840 --> 13:23.093
-It's not gonna work, is it, Lukas?
-[conch shell blowing]

13:32.811 --> 13:34.396
[grunts]

13:36.190 --> 13:38.317
Wait. I think it just might.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.037
[grunts]

13:50.120 --> 13:51.747
[roaring]

13:53.040 --> 13:54.500
Increíble.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.377
-Great job, Kong.
-[chuckling]

13:56.836 --> 13:58.295
-[grunting]
-[Lukas] Oh, yeah.

13:59.129 --> 14:02.800
And that was amazing!
Coolest conch solo I've ever heard.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.051
We should jam some time.

14:04.718 --> 14:06.011
The city is safe.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.264
Now, let's look for Danny.

14:10.474 --> 14:12.226
-[sighs]
-[squeaking]

14:18.274 --> 14:19.400
Ah!

14:19.483 --> 14:22.528
[panting] Come on, Zippi,
this might be our way out.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.531
[grunts] What on earth?

14:26.991 --> 14:28.868
[bugs chittering]

14:29.994 --> 14:32.204
-What is this place?
-[squeaking]

14:34.582 --> 14:36.208
Are these things bugs?

14:36.917 --> 14:40.296
I can just barely hear
what they're saying.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.965
-[bugs chittering]
-I think they want us to follow them.

14:45.009 --> 14:46.760
[squeaking]

14:50.556 --> 14:52.474
Zippi! [panting]

14:52.558 --> 14:53.559
Hey, wait!

14:58.355 --> 14:59.732
Whoa!

15:00.274 --> 15:02.318
This looks like the mushroom
on the hieroglyphics we saw

15:02.401 --> 15:03.360
when we first arrived here.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.779
[squeaking]

15:12.745 --> 15:13.662
[gasps]

15:15.873 --> 15:18.417
[chuckles] I've played enough video games
to know that

15:18.500 --> 15:20.794
this'll probably come in handy
at some point.

15:22.755 --> 15:26.091
I'm pretty sure if we follow those bugs,
they'll lead us out of this place.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.177
[squeaking]

15:29.219 --> 15:30.763
Or you will.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.475
[Tanker] What you are doing is wrong.

15:34.558 --> 15:38.062
I was created with free will
and you are taking it from me.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.858
My captain might have programmed me,
but you are oppressing me.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.527
Hmm, he's got a good point.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.071
You will submit.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.491
[clones grunting] Whoa!

15:51.075 --> 15:52.534
First you, and then...

15:53.160 --> 15:55.371
[gasps] Whoa!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.874
[gasps] Oops.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.962
[Botila grunts] Get me, you fools.
I must regain my connection.

16:05.005 --> 16:07.132
-[screams]
-[water splashes]

16:08.008 --> 16:09.301
My bad.

16:10.719 --> 16:14.264
Don't just stand there gaping,
you worthless doorstops.

16:14.348 --> 16:16.183
Get down here and... [gasps]

16:19.561 --> 16:22.815
[Tanker sighs] My mind is clearing.

16:22.898 --> 16:27.152
First order of business:
eliminate intruders.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.447
[water splashes]

16:30.531 --> 16:31.824
That's better.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.242
[all gasp]

16:33.325 --> 16:37.413
[Tanker] You are still trespassing.
I would like you to leave.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.039
Now.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.375
No problem at all, sir.

16:41.458 --> 16:44.712
Excellent. And thank you
for your assistance.

16:44.795 --> 16:47.965
I have no idea what you're talking about.

16:48.048 --> 16:51.260
Me, neither. [laughing]

17:13.741 --> 17:16.452
[gasps] Dead end.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.163
Now what? Huh?

17:24.960 --> 17:27.296
[chuckles] Oh, that is cool!

17:29.465 --> 17:31.842
[grunts] Oh, sunlight!

17:32.551 --> 17:35.679
Or lava-light. Or bioluminescence...

17:35.763 --> 17:38.766
Oh, who cares?
I'm just glad to be out of the dark.

17:38.849 --> 17:39.850
[squeaking]

17:42.478 --> 17:44.646
Oh, I knew this key would come in handy.

17:44.730 --> 17:48.150
Oh, I can't wait to tell everyone about
all the crazy stuff we saw down there.

17:48.233 --> 17:52.529
Like those bugs and that giant mushroom
and this key.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.158
[squeaking]

17:58.994 --> 18:01.080
Danny! Can you hear me?

18:01.663 --> 18:02.706
[grunting]

18:07.002 --> 18:10.380
Lucky, find Danny. Find Danny!

18:13.509 --> 18:15.052
Be careful, Kong.

18:15.135 --> 18:18.055
My darling Danny
could be anywhere under that rubble.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.681
[grunting]

18:26.522 --> 18:28.774
[sniffs and purrs]

18:28.857 --> 18:31.276
Over here! Lucky smells something!

18:31.360 --> 18:33.904
-[pants] Bucket brigade!
-Right.

18:33.987 --> 18:37.199
-[grunts] Here, Jonesy.
-Got it.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.409
-Take it, Anita.
-Sí. [grunts]

18:39.493 --> 18:41.912
Ten cuidado, Panchi. It's heavy.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.956
Okay, tía. Here you go.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.833
-Danny?
-Yeah.

18:45.916 --> 18:49.253
-[all gasp]
-Whoa! [laughing]

18:49.336 --> 18:50.420
What are we digging for?

18:51.088 --> 18:53.757
Ah. Cool! I've been looking for that.

18:55.300 --> 18:56.260
[laughs]

18:56.343 --> 18:58.679
[chuckles] We've been looking for you.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.139
Where have you been, kid?

19:00.222 --> 19:02.141
Oh, you won't believe it, Lukas.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.268
Zippi and I found this amazing...

19:04.351 --> 19:05.894
-Whoa!
-[grunting excitedly]

19:07.104 --> 19:09.439
[laughing] Glad to see you too, big guy.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.401
So, what caused the earthquake?

19:13.402 --> 19:16.280
We don't know.
It may have been a natural event.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.198
Or it may have been Botila.

19:18.740 --> 19:21.660
I'm telling you guys, she's ice cold.

19:21.743 --> 19:25.038
Either way, we've got to determine
the cause of this cave-in.

19:25.122 --> 19:28.500
If it was Botila,
we'll have to deal with her.

19:28.584 --> 19:31.211
We have to deal with her no matter what.

19:34.047 --> 19:38.510
Removing my head to link to an AI
has proven to be problematic,

19:38.594 --> 19:41.680
as your bumbling has made painfully clear.

19:41.763 --> 19:45.601
How come when your plans go wrong,
it's our fault?

19:45.684 --> 19:49.313
The things that fall out of your mouth
really make me feel that

19:49.396 --> 19:53.358
your free will is overtaking
your artificial intelligence!

19:56.695 --> 19:59.865
Ah... Yes.

20:00.699 --> 20:05.454
With all of the stuff you spout
about free will for AIs, you sure--

20:05.537 --> 20:09.541
Silence! You should be standing
at attention, saluting my superiority.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.088
Interesting.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.548
Clones, at ease.

20:17.549 --> 20:19.593
We'll see who's in control.

20:19.676 --> 20:21.428
Cluck like a chicken.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.096
[clones clucking]

20:26.892 --> 20:30.854
Now, if I focus,
perhaps I can see the world...

20:38.153 --> 20:41.782
[all] from a whole new perspective.
[laughing]

20:45.619 --> 20:47.621
