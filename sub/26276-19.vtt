to pick up his new boat

we were glad to do it.

I'm a private investigator.
Well, I will be.

09:55.116 --> 09:57.161
I've just got to, you know,

09:57.205 --> 09:58.206
build up my clientele.

09:58.249 --> 09:59.729
Hmm.

09:59.773 --> 10:03.254
So... you're unemployed.

10:03.298 --> 10:06.606
Just until my
first case, yeah.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.129
I assume that you've
already got your

10:08.172 --> 10:09.173
private investigator's
license, then?

10:09.217 --> 10:11.001
Is that a thing?

10:11.045 --> 10:13.525
Yes, that's very much a thing.

10:13.569 --> 10:16.224
Uh, if you want to
work legally, of course.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.705
Well, at least I have something
to do this afternoon.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.404
You know, uh, I actually
don't have a car.

10:22.447 --> 10:24.667
May I suggest a cab?

10:24.711 --> 10:26.930
That's a good idea, but I'm...

10:26.974 --> 10:28.845
kind of broke right now.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.281
You mind...

10:30.325 --> 10:31.848
maybe spotting me a little cash?

10:38.159 --> 10:39.377
Thank you.

10:39.421 --> 10:41.641
Trust me, I'm good for it.

10:44.426 --> 10:45.862
You were a total mooch
from day one as well.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.168
What?

10:47.211 --> 10:48.386
I'm still good for it.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.042
Come here.

10:52.086 --> 10:54.044
Let me check your arm.

10:55.176 --> 10:57.439
You're seeping.Tourniquet?

10:57.482 --> 10:59.267
No, we got to keep
the arm mobile.

10:59.310 --> 11:02.052
Ugh. I'm chumming the water.

11:02.096 --> 11:04.141
In tiger shark
territory, no less.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.360
I'm-I'm really not happy
about this.

11:05.403 --> 11:06.622
Happy about being shot

11:06.666 --> 11:08.145
or stuck in the middle
of the ocean?

11:08.189 --> 11:11.714
About admitting that, ah,
your plan is now our best bet.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.803
Are you sure?

11:13.847 --> 11:15.500
I know what I said
before, but...

11:15.544 --> 11:18.329
swimming across the Molokai
Channel's gonna be difficult.

11:18.373 --> 11:20.549
We're upwind and swimming
against the current.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.159
And you're still losing
a lot of blood.

11:23.552 --> 11:25.336
You're talking to
the three-time captain

11:25.380 --> 11:26.686
of the Cambridge Unified
swim team.

11:26.729 --> 11:29.601
[chuckles]
Of course I am.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.823
So where are
we heading?Well...

11:33.867 --> 11:37.740
it's five miles due south
and probably a mile

11:37.784 --> 11:39.220
to get to the channel.

11:40.656 --> 11:41.744
You good?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.703
[quietly]:
Okay. Let's go.

12:01.938 --> 12:04.158
Dude, you're wearing out
the soles of your shoes.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.943
Yeah, seriously, you're
like a dad in a waiting room

12:06.987 --> 12:08.858
whose wife's about
to give birth.

12:08.902 --> 12:09.859
Probably even a
little suspicious

12:09.903 --> 12:11.078
that the kid's even yours.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.123
And second thoughts
about the marriage...

12:13.167 --> 12:13.863
Rick.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.082
What? Huh?We get it.

12:15.125 --> 12:19.608
We get it. Point is,
you look anxious. Relax.

12:19.651 --> 12:20.870
[phone chimes]

12:22.916 --> 12:24.613
What is it?

12:26.093 --> 12:29.313
Shammy, no need to rush
fixing the chopper today.

12:29.357 --> 12:31.707
Not that I'm complaining,
but why?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.404
My dad's not coming.

12:33.448 --> 12:35.406
What? Why?

12:35.450 --> 12:38.540
He said something came up,
and he'll make it out here soon.

12:39.541 --> 12:40.716
You okay?

12:40.760 --> 12:43.023
Yeah. It's all good.

12:43.066 --> 12:46.635
I mean, it's a bummer. But
honestly, I'm used to it.

12:46.678 --> 12:49.159
I'm more annoyed that I had to
iron this shirt for nothing.

12:49.203 --> 12:51.161
Yeah, ironing's a scam.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.641
That's what I'm saying.It's nothing that

12:52.684 --> 12:55.078
seven minutes in a dryer
or outside a hot shower

12:55.122 --> 12:56.819
can't fix.[chuckles]

12:56.863 --> 13:00.170
I don't know, I think
you guys are just lazy.[phone rings]

13:00.214 --> 13:01.432
Kumu, what's up?

13:01.476 --> 13:04.087
Rick, have you heard
from Magnum or Higgins?

13:04.131 --> 13:05.436
No, why?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.830
[exhales]
They were supposed to be back

13:07.874 --> 13:10.398
with Mr. Masters' new boat
hours ago.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.442
Both of their cell phones

13:11.486 --> 13:12.661
are going directly
to voice mail.

13:12.704 --> 13:13.836
TC:
Ha, come on.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.142
You know Thomas.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.796
He probably didn't put enough
gas in the tank.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.449
Probably had to row
that thing back. [chuckles]

13:18.493 --> 13:19.668
I wish.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.365
I called the people
who sold the boat.

13:21.409 --> 13:23.977
They said its AIS
went off-line today

13:24.020 --> 13:25.456
for the first time in years.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.675
AIS?

13:26.718 --> 13:28.764
Automatic Identification System.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.722
It's the transponder
on the boat.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.550
Did the water-activated
beacon go off?

13:32.594 --> 13:33.769
KUMU: No.All right,

13:33.813 --> 13:34.901
so they didn't sink.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.163
Somebody had to
shut it off manually.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.294
But who?

13:37.338 --> 13:39.470
Thomas and Juliet
wouldn't do that.

13:39.514 --> 13:41.472
Listen, Kumu, there's nothing
to worry about yet.

13:41.516 --> 13:42.865
I got a sailor buddy...

13:42.909 --> 13:43.953
You mean smuggler.

13:43.997 --> 13:45.476
Semantics.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
He knows these waters better
than anybody.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.697
We'll see if
he's heard anything.Okay.

13:48.740 --> 13:52.222
I'll notify the Coast Guard.
Thanks, Rick.

13:52.266 --> 13:54.485
Nothing to worry
about yet?

13:54.529 --> 13:56.705
We'll see.
We got to get down to the docks.

13:56.748 --> 13:58.576
My buddy won't talk
on a hard line.

13:58.620 --> 14:00.622
All right, let's move.

14:09.544 --> 14:12.373
[exhales]We're at the edge
of the channel.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.201
You're tired
and you're losing blood.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.506
Any suggestions?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.508
Yeah.
Take your pants off.

14:17.552 --> 14:18.596
I'm sorry?

14:18.640 --> 14:19.902
The sling method.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.949
Oh. Right.

14:25.995 --> 14:27.867
Here.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.622
Put it around
your neck.

14:45.841 --> 14:46.842
[sighs]

14:49.062 --> 14:50.628
What is it?

14:53.805 --> 14:54.981
Is everything okay?

14:55.024 --> 14:57.244
Hold on, give me
a second.

14:57.287 --> 14:59.115
Okay, I'm bleeding out
into the ocean. Now really

14:59.159 --> 15:00.421
isn't the time to be keeping
things to yourself.

15:00.464 --> 15:02.858
But you always do this.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.123
When were you gonna
tell me?Tell you what?

15:07.167 --> 15:09.343
That Robin has hired you as
a security consultant

15:09.386 --> 15:10.910
to do a detailed analysis
of the property?

15:10.953 --> 15:14.652
Relax. It's just to
supplement my P.I. income.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.176
Or lack thereof.

15:16.219 --> 15:17.612
You didn't think that
I ought to know about this?

15:17.655 --> 15:20.528
I wouldn't be a good
security consultant

15:20.571 --> 15:22.747
if I told you I was
assessing the security.

15:22.791 --> 15:24.662
Wait.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.360
Is that why you hopped
over the fence

15:26.403 --> 15:28.318
when you first got here, 'cause
you were trying to see how easy

15:28.362 --> 15:29.276
it would be to break in?

15:29.319 --> 15:31.234
Got to admit.
It's pretty easy.

15:31.278 --> 15:32.627
Easy?

15:32.670 --> 15:34.672
Zeus and Apollo would have
torn you limb from limb

15:34.716 --> 15:35.760
had I not stopped them.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.240
And this is utterly
preposterous.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.286
You don't even know half
of the employees that work here.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.331
Try me.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.639
The groundskeepers.
The window cleaner.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.510
The delivery man.
All here today.

15:46.554 --> 15:48.686
Wait. We have
groundskeepers?

15:48.730 --> 15:50.123
I'm kidding.

15:50.166 --> 15:52.908
Groundskeepers got here
at 7:55 a.m. minus Roberto,

15:52.952 --> 15:54.475
he was a couple minutes late.

15:54.518 --> 15:57.434
Uh, we had two deliveries
at 11:15 a.m.,

15:57.478 --> 15:59.262
three additional packages
at 2:00 p.m.,

15:59.306 --> 16:01.830
and the window cleaner thing,
that's a trick question,

16:01.873 --> 16:03.092
because Jimmy doesn't
come here today,

16:03.136 --> 16:04.311
he comes here on Tuesdays.

16:05.877 --> 16:08.837
Are you...

16:08.880 --> 16:10.143
really that bothered

16:10.186 --> 16:11.579
that I'm the security
consultant around here?

16:11.622 --> 16:14.799
No. It bothers me that
you didn't think to tell me.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.149
From here on out,

16:16.192 --> 16:17.150
it doesn't matter what it is,

16:17.193 --> 16:19.630
doesn't matter how bad it is...

16:19.674 --> 16:21.154
I want to know the truth.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.155
What are you doing?

16:22.198 --> 16:23.765
I'm wave-piloting.

16:23.808 --> 16:25.593
HIGGINS:
Wave-piloting?

16:25.636 --> 16:27.290
Primitive form of navigation
based on the shape

16:27.334 --> 16:28.596
and the direction
of the waves.

16:28.639 --> 16:30.511
It's kind of like a road map,
but in the water.

16:30.554 --> 16:31.903
And what, pray tell,
does the map say?

16:31.947 --> 16:34.471
We need to move. Now.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.473
You good to go?Do I have a choice?

16:36.517 --> 16:37.648
No.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.485
Come on.
Let's go, Higgins.

17:00.584 --> 17:01.803
You okay?

17:01.846 --> 17:05.372
Yeah, man, uh,
just worried about our boy.

17:05.415 --> 17:07.156
You find anything out?

17:07.200 --> 17:09.071
Yeah. You're not
gonna like it.

17:09.115 --> 17:11.769
He said there's been a string
of boat-jackings lately.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.555
Two-man team taking high-end
boats like Robin's.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.122
He said their M.O.
is they send out

17:16.165 --> 17:18.559
bogus SOS signals to
lure in their victims.

17:18.602 --> 17:20.648
That could be what happened
to Thomas and Higgy.

17:20.691 --> 17:22.041
That's what
I'm thinking.

17:22.084 --> 17:23.520
He gave me a name of a guy
who's got connections

17:23.564 --> 17:24.608
to the boat-jackers.

17:24.652 --> 17:27.959
Who?Kahi Kina.
Goes by Double K.

17:28.003 --> 17:30.614
That's a
terrible name.Agreed.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.268
Apparently he deals
in stolen rigs

17:32.312 --> 17:33.530
while running a cover business
painting boats.

17:33.574 --> 17:36.011
Which I bet he uses
to repaint the hot boats

17:36.055 --> 17:37.186
to look unrecognizable.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.666
Exactly.

17:38.709 --> 17:41.364
[sighs] Okay, so where does this
Double K dude hang out?

17:41.408 --> 17:42.887
Hostess bar called
the Swan Club.

17:42.931 --> 17:44.193
You want to pay a visit?

17:44.237 --> 17:46.587
Yeah. But you got to
show me how to get there.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.807
Don't act like I know
where this place is.Uh-huh.

17:49.851 --> 17:51.679
♪ My lil' bebe

17:51.722 --> 17:53.637
♪ Change your life, yeah

17:53.681 --> 17:55.335
♪ That's a upgrade

17:55.378 --> 17:57.641
♪ On your ice, yeah

17:57.685 --> 17:58.816
Huh.

17:58.860 --> 18:00.470
♪ Oh, yeah, yeah...

18:00.514 --> 18:02.820
[sighs] So how are we
gonna play this?

18:02.864 --> 18:04.431
What do you mean?

18:04.474 --> 18:06.737
If Magnum and Higgins
got jacked,

18:06.781 --> 18:09.349
and this Double K dude
is in on it?

18:09.392 --> 18:11.655
He might be a little jumpy
if two complete strangers

18:11.699 --> 18:13.222
are suddenly dropping by
to see him.

18:13.266 --> 18:15.485
Yeah, good point.

18:17.183 --> 18:18.662
Oh, huh.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.535
Yo. Now's not the time.

18:21.578 --> 18:23.711
Man, Clara runs this joint.

18:23.754 --> 18:25.582
I'm just gonna have a little
chat with her,

18:25.626 --> 18:27.367
one club manager to another.

18:27.410 --> 18:28.585
Clara!

18:28.629 --> 18:30.979
Rick. Good to see you.

18:31.022 --> 18:32.937
Hey. Good to see you.

18:32.981 --> 18:35.114
This is my buddy TC.Hey, how you doing?

18:35.157 --> 18:36.985
Hi.Uh, listen,

18:37.028 --> 18:38.856
we were hoping you could
introduce us to somebody.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.684
There's someone on this island
you don't know?

18:40.728 --> 18:43.165
Who?Double K.

18:43.209 --> 18:45.559
Why do you need
to speak with him?

18:45.602 --> 18:47.648
Just ask a few questions.

18:47.691 --> 18:49.650
You can't just barge in here
and mess with my customers.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.695
This is a legitimate
place of business.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.481
[chuckles] Come on, Clara.
You and I both know

18:54.524 --> 18:55.656
there's nothing legitimate
about this place.

18:55.699 --> 18:57.310
Except those pork dumplings,

18:57.353 --> 18:59.573
the ones you guys do with the
ponzu sauce? Those are legit.

18:59.616 --> 19:02.358
Sorry, Rick.
Can't help you out.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.969
Look, a friend of mine
is in trouble, all right?

19:05.013 --> 19:06.057
Just a few minutes

19:06.101 --> 19:06.884
and we're gone.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.673
I'll tell him he has visitors.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.110
If he's amenable,
you boys can chat outside.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.938
Thank you.

19:19.462 --> 19:22.204
