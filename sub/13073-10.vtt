But what could it be?

18:15.360 --> 18:20.265
Diamonds? Faberge Eggs?
Unrefrigerated cheeses?

18:20.332 --> 18:23.769
{\an3}Whatever is in there
must be very valuable.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.137
(Harvey)
Okay.

18:25.204 --> 18:27.406
We're finally
at the witch's lair.

18:27.473 --> 18:29.842
Rawr!
I'm the witch.

18:29.908 --> 18:31.443
We meet at last.

18:31.510 --> 18:33.045
Yeah, and I can
dance real good,

18:33.111 --> 18:35.113
so deal with that.

18:35.180 --> 18:36.982
He can't see you, Princess.

18:37.049 --> 18:37.916
Whatever. His loss.

18:37.983 --> 18:41.119
Well, evil witch,

18:41.186 --> 18:43.222
today is your day
of reckoning.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.457
I cast a power orb!

18:45.524 --> 18:47.960
Nuh-uh. Force field.

18:48.026 --> 18:49.795
Okay.
Ice blast.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.097
{\an3}Dodged it.

18:52.164 --> 18:54.032
I kill you with a fireball.

18:54.099 --> 18:55.634
Nope, I'm immortal now.

18:55.701 --> 18:59.104
Oh, no, they'll never
be safe if she's immortal.

18:59.171 --> 19:00.739
[Foo whimpers]

19:00.806 --> 19:02.007
Kill the witch!

19:02.074 --> 19:03.675
[battle cries]

19:03.742 --> 19:05.143
[grunting and punches landing]

19:05.210 --> 19:07.179
The annoying witch
has been destroyed.

19:07.246 --> 19:08.146
{\an3}[growls]

19:08.213 --> 19:10.682
I, the talking tree,

19:10.749 --> 19:13.952
have sacrificed myself
in battle.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.355
[flute playing]

19:16.421 --> 19:19.391
No! I'll never forget you,
talking tree.

19:19.458 --> 19:23.395
{\an1}[sobbing]

19:23.462 --> 19:27.065
{\an3}It's safe to come out now,
all right, Foo?

19:27.132 --> 19:28.867
Yeah.
I guess you're right.

19:28.934 --> 19:30.369
Okay.
Here I come.

19:30.435 --> 19:32.538
{\an1}Eh? See?
Told you.

19:32.604 --> 19:34.373
Surprise, you fools.

19:34.439 --> 19:35.541
[all gasp]

19:35.607 --> 19:38.577
{\an3}We have come
for whatever is in zat box.

19:38.644 --> 19:41.446
{\an3}It is clearly valuable
if you are going to such lengths

19:41.513 --> 19:43.015
to protect it.

19:43.081 --> 19:44.550
Wh-what's going on?

19:44.616 --> 19:45.717
I thought you guys
said it was safe.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.453
{\an3}Uh, hold on, Foo.
Don't worry.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.422
Back off,
you fluffy-tailed freaks.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.958
Whatever you have got in zere,
we want it all.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.726
Every last bit of it.

19:54.793 --> 19:58.196
Wha? What?
[whimpering]

19:58.263 --> 20:00.265
{\an3}That's it.
I'm never coming out.

20:00.332 --> 20:01.533
{\an1}[gasps]

20:01.600 --> 20:03.302
Everybody, let's just
put down the acorns.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.237
{\an3}Nobody's looking
for a fight.

20:05.304 --> 20:08.674
[grunts]
I will annihilate you!

20:08.740 --> 20:09.975
Charge!

20:12.210 --> 20:15.447
But I'm already dead.
Ah!

20:15.514 --> 20:16.815
Ow. Ow.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.017
Come out here and fight me,
you bark-scratchers.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.652
[growls]
Oof.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.588
Harvey, I got your back, man.

20:22.654 --> 20:23.989
Agh! No!
My--my power.

20:24.056 --> 20:26.058
Are those horses?

20:26.124 --> 20:27.125
Do they have tanks?

20:27.192 --> 20:28.927
Give us zat treasure.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.264
{\an3}You leave me no choice.
<i>En garde.</i>

20:32.331 --> 20:35.133
{\an1}What is zat,
just a child's baton?

20:35.200 --> 20:36.101
{\an3}Ha1

20:36.168 --> 20:36.902
I don't know, is it?

20:36.969 --> 20:40.305
[karate noises]

20:40.372 --> 20:42.474
{\an3}[sobbing]

20:46.912 --> 20:50.415
[gibberish]

20:50.482 --> 20:52.384
{\an1}Oof.
Foo, you have to run.

20:52.451 --> 20:53.118
Your snacks aren't safe here.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.386
We'll slow them down

20:54.453 --> 20:57.489
{\an3}with our pile
of defeated bodies.

20:57.556 --> 20:59.257
I'll run to the mountains.
I'll live all alone.

20:59.324 --> 21:03.195
Just me and my--
my Furberries.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.969
{\an3}[gasps]
Foo.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.004
[kazoo sounds]

21:12.070 --> 21:13.205
Leave my friends alone.

21:13.271 --> 21:14.406
This is what you're after.

21:14.473 --> 21:17.743
- Here, take it.
- What is zis?

21:17.809 --> 21:20.112
{\an3}[spits]
Eh. Zis is not food.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.081
Zis is an atrocity.

21:23.148 --> 21:26.685
Ugh, ze after taste.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.420
Does anyone have gum?

21:28.487 --> 21:29.988
Foo, you're back.

21:30.055 --> 21:31.690
Yep. I was being a jerk.

21:31.757 --> 21:32.658
You guys are
such good friends.

21:32.724 --> 21:35.027
You even defeated
a witch for me.

21:35.093 --> 21:37.095
Um, we sure did.

21:37.162 --> 21:38.096
Yup.

21:38.163 --> 21:40.699
I heard it was
mostly the tree guy.

21:40.766 --> 21:42.067
He was pretty heroic.

21:42.134 --> 21:45.070
You've done so much for me,
and in return,

21:45.137 --> 21:47.439
all you wanted was for me
to share my snacks with you.

21:47.506 --> 21:48.407
- No!
- Get those away from me.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.508
I don't want those.

21:49.574 --> 21:52.277
- Here you go. Have some.
- Why?

21:52.344 --> 21:53.478
- For you.
- Please no.

21:53.545 --> 21:57.916
Everyone, don't be shy.
Go on, dig in.

21:57.983 --> 21:58.550
[all gagging]

21:58.617 --> 22:00.952
Sharing is great.
