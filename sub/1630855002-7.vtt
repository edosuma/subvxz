WEBVTT

00:10.218 --> 00:13.638
- Did we wake up at the same--
- I've been up since four.

00:17.142 --> 00:19.561
<i>♪ Gee, it's nice to really know someone ♪</i>

00:19.561 --> 00:23.064

00:31.448 --> 00:34.701

00:34.701 --> 00:37.704

00:37.704 --> 00:39.581
Whoa!

00:39.581 --> 00:43.043
PB&J instead of turkey?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.336
I'm sorry, is it Christmas?

00:45.336 --> 00:46.880
I'm leaving you.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.177
Like, to run an errand?

00:52.177 --> 00:54.471
Because if you're goin'
anywhere near the pharmacy,

00:54.471 --> 00:56.556
I need some more cherry lozenges.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.767
The lemon ones ya got me were too spicy.

00:58.767 --> 01:02.479
No, Ned, I...
not leaving for the pharmacy.

01:02.479 --> 01:04.981
I'm... leaving.

01:06.149 --> 01:06.983
Forever.

01:07.275 --> 01:09.319
But we're getting married in six days.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.403
Yeah.

01:11.613 --> 01:14.949
I think I'm gonna mess all that up?

01:15.700 --> 01:17.911

02:05.375 --> 02:08.002
Oh. Don't worry, Yogurt.
He'll be home so--

02:09.879 --> 02:12.715
Fine. You know what? Forget it.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.599
Non-identical.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.893
- You need a rhyme for tentacle, right?

02:23.893 --> 02:27.188
"Nonidentical."

02:29.065 --> 02:31.693
- N-o-n--
- Will you please shut up?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.903
Believe me, Lindsers,
the last thing you want

02:33.903 --> 02:36.114
is a muse who starts self-censoring.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.449
You are not my muse, Ned.
You are my block.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.492
Basically, the same thing.

02:39.492 --> 02:41.161
God, I have not been able to write

02:41.161 --> 02:42.662
a word since you showed up.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.997
Well, it's not my fault you can't write

02:43.997 --> 02:46.332
because you feel terrible
about ruining my life.

02:46.916 --> 02:50.211
- I didn't ruin your life.
- Well, you wouldn't know, would ya?

02:50.753 --> 02:53.006
It's not like ya picked up
the ol' telephone to check in

02:53.006 --> 02:56.342
on the good Dr. Ned
over the last eight months.

02:56.342 --> 02:59.012
What kind of person would
hold onto somethin' like that?

03:02.765 --> 03:05.935
Eventually... you're gonna
have to deal with us, Linds.

03:05.935 --> 03:08.646
'Cause we're here,
and we are not goin' anywhere.

03:08.646 --> 03:12.358
It's not like you can
just get rid of us.

03:12.358 --> 03:14.611
What? What's that face?

03:16.654 --> 03:17.655
No.

03:18.114 --> 03:20.867
So, I'm now officially pre-approved.

03:20.867 --> 03:22.994
- Wow!
- Hey!

03:22.994 --> 03:25.955
Yeah, I have an appointment
to go see a one-bedroom next week.

03:25.955 --> 03:28.249
- 27th floor.
- That's amazing.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.501
- Yeah.
- This is at the Condom?

03:30.501 --> 03:32.295
Ha-ha. You know it's
not called the Condom.

03:32.295 --> 03:33.421
It's the Corinthian.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.673
Well, movin' on up in the world.

03:35.673 --> 03:37.342
Promotion, apartment.

03:37.342 --> 03:38.468
So, you guys moving in together?

03:41.179 --> 03:44.390
- Oh, um--
- I, I mean, we-we've only been

03:44.390 --> 03:46.809
going out a few months, so.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.186
I really am gonna find my own place.

03:48.186 --> 03:50.230
I've just been so distracted

03:50.230 --> 03:52.398
trying to finish this book, you know?

03:52.398 --> 03:55.360
But I think, today, I-I might've
had a breakthrough, actually.

03:55.360 --> 03:58.112
- Hey, that's exciting.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.451
Did he eat today?

04:03.451 --> 04:05.411
I left him some treats out

04:05.411 --> 04:07.330
at a reasonable distance,

04:07.330 --> 04:09.374
- but Miguel says--
- You know how he gets

04:09.374 --> 04:12.669
pukey with other people, so
it's just safer for me to do it.

04:23.888 --> 04:25.431
Hey.

04:26.849 --> 04:27.976
- Hey.
- What's that?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.019
Oh, the game that I worked on,

04:30.019 --> 04:31.688
the release party's tomorrow.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.399
Fun! I wanna go. Can I go?

04:35.275 --> 04:36.901
I'm not going.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.987
What?! Miguel.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.073
I haven't talked to anyone
there in, like, two years.

04:42.073 --> 04:44.575
So what? You helped make that game.

04:44.575 --> 04:45.618
They're celebrating you.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.412
No, this was a completely

04:47.412 --> 04:48.621
different part of my life.

04:48.621 --> 04:51.833
Still, you can't just run from your past,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.711
or shove it in a suitcase
and throw it in a dumpster

04:54.711 --> 04:56.713
behind a Greek restaurant in Queens,

04:56.713 --> 04:58.256
so to speak.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.009
Only if you come with me.

05:01.009 --> 05:02.719
We'll just have one drink.

05:04.262 --> 05:07.140
Rooting around
in a public garbage receptacle

05:07.140 --> 05:10.351
as if she's never heard
the words "Hepatitis C" before.

05:10.351 --> 05:11.769
New low, Linds.

05:11.769 --> 05:14.731
I have to bring it back.
I just want this to be over.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.941
Ned is going to be furious
when he sees you.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.860
You stole his mother's
wedding dress.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.363
The one in which you were meant
to wed her dear, sweet son.

05:22.363 --> 05:25.700
Not on purpose! You know, I-I just left
in such a hurry,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.286
I guess it got swept up with everything.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.539
- I mean, I forgot I even had it.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.665
It's true!

05:32.665 --> 05:34.959
You're walking into trouble, Linds.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.419
Everyone loves Ned.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.296
He's one of the most popular dentists

05:38.296 --> 05:40.006
in all of southern Vermont.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.050
The way you up and left?

05:42.050 --> 05:44.260
Oh, you're gonna have to answer for that.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.637
You're being dramatic.

05:46.637 --> 05:49.182
Sure, I might have
to talk through a few things.

05:49.182 --> 05:53.519
And yes, my timing
was slightly less than ideal.

05:53.519 --> 05:57.690
But once I calmly explain
why I made the choices I made,

05:57.690 --> 05:59.275
everyone will understand.

05:59.275 --> 06:03.404
You're gonna have to give
the performance of a lifetime.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.407
Yeah? Well, just you watch.

06:06.407 --> 06:10.870

09:02.500 --> 09:05.002
I am so sorry. I never meant to
take your dress.

09:05.002 --> 09:06.254
And I never meant to hurt Ned.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.797
Please, please, please don't hate me.

09:07.797 --> 09:08.756
Hate you?!

09:08.756 --> 09:11.509
Ah! How could I hate you?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.804
You brave, brave angel.

09:14.804 --> 09:18.474
And what a dear, bringing my dress back.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.477
And you're here for Syrup Nights.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.564
- It's Syrup Nights?
- Come in. Have a cider.

09:24.564 --> 09:25.982
Everyone's going to be so

09:25.982 --> 09:29.360
excited to see you.

09:29.360 --> 09:31.445
Uh... e-everyone?

09:31.988 --> 09:35.074
- Look who's here!

09:36.117 --> 09:37.577
Hi, I'm sorry. Hi.

09:37.577 --> 09:41.038
I know. I'm really sorry.
I'm so sorry. Hi.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.832
How are you? You look like
you're feeling better.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.625
- I'm sorry.
Lindsay?

09:46.502 --> 09:47.712
Is it really you?

09:48.129 --> 09:48.963
I--

09:50.506 --> 09:52.883
You're walking so well.

09:52.883 --> 09:54.552
Can't believe it!

09:54.552 --> 09:56.887
- Let's-- Can we just--
- Sure.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.434
Ned, listen,

10:02.310 --> 10:04.228
I wanted to apologize to you,

10:04.228 --> 10:06.564
face to face, for everything that I did.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.650
For... for leaving like that,
and for never calling--

10:09.650 --> 10:11.193
Stop it right there.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.988
I refuse to accept an apology from you.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.282
I mean, how could I?

10:16.282 --> 10:17.950
It wasn't your fault.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.286
Lindsay,

10:20.286 --> 10:21.537
when you blew up our life

10:21.537 --> 10:22.913
with absolutely no warning,

10:22.913 --> 10:24.582
and seemingly without a shred

10:24.582 --> 10:26.083
of basic human decency,

10:26.709 --> 10:28.336
that wasn't you.

10:28.711 --> 10:32.757
You were in the grips
of a tick-borne psychosis.

10:34.800 --> 10:38.179
So, you enter the room here.

10:38.179 --> 10:39.680
You see

10:43.142 --> 10:44.268
Fiona.

10:46.354 --> 10:47.355
Do you approach her

10:47.355 --> 10:49.315
or do you wait for her to see you,

10:49.315 --> 10:50.858
like a fucking peasant?

10:51.233 --> 10:52.943
- I approach her.
- Yes!

10:52.943 --> 10:55.529
You approach her hard

10:56.072 --> 10:57.823
with a thick stack of business cards.

10:57.823 --> 11:00.159
Well, maybe just one business card.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.870
Goddammit! I knew you weren't
ready for this.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.581
I just don't know why I'd be giving her
a whole stack of them.

11:05.581 --> 11:08.918
How else are you supposed
to segue into the line,

11:08.918 --> 11:12.546
"Looks like the odds
are stacked in my favor?"

11:12.546 --> 11:13.714
Why am I saying that?

11:13.714 --> 11:15.633
Dude! The whole point of this night

11:15.633 --> 11:18.969
is to rub her nose
in the huge mistake she made.

11:18.969 --> 11:20.554
I mean, look at you!

11:20.554 --> 11:23.974
You got the job; you got the girlfriend.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.351
I'm gonna stick with one business card.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.812
Bro, do you want tonight

11:27.812 --> 11:29.897
to end in a sloppy

11:29.897 --> 11:33.317
<i>ménage à trois</i> with Lindsay
and Fiona or not?

11:34.402 --> 11:35.319
Not.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.697
Okay. Well, then I'm confused.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.782
<i>Tick-borne psychosis?</i>

11:39.782 --> 11:41.158
This really isn't a great time.

11:41.158 --> 11:43.703
I have 30 dresses to finish
for the Maple Pageant.

11:43.703 --> 11:47.331
You told everyone that I had
a tick-borne psychosis?

11:47.331 --> 11:48.499
No!

11:50.084 --> 11:53.462
You have to understand
you left so suddenly.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.673
People had already bought plane tickets

11:55.673 --> 11:57.925
and gifts from your registry.

11:57.925 --> 12:01.554
Oh, and you and Ned
seemed so perfect together.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.683
The whole town was confused
about you abandoning it all

12:05.683 --> 12:08.936
for some sort of... sweepstakes you won?

12:08.936 --> 12:10.563
It was a short story contest.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.732
I am the one who had to stay here

12:12.732 --> 12:15.234
and face everyone... alone.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.737
All of them asking the same question,

12:17.737 --> 12:19.321
"Who on Earth would raise a daughter

12:19.321 --> 12:20.865
that could do something like that?"

12:21.407 --> 12:22.950
They actually asked you that?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.077
With their eyes.

12:25.494 --> 12:27.621
- Right.
- So, one night I saw a segment on <i>Dateline</i>

12:27.621 --> 12:30.416
about Lyme Disease causing
seemingly well-adjusted people

12:30.416 --> 12:33.085
to do seemingly insane things.

12:33.085 --> 12:35.337
And the next day, I was at
the deli counter ordering,

12:35.337 --> 12:37.006
and I wondered aloud...

12:37.006 --> 12:40.259
casually, if maybe that happened to you.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.969
- Mom!
I didn't say it!

12:41.969 --> 12:43.637
I wondered it!

12:43.637 --> 12:46.766
But you know how this town talks.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.310
Honestly, Ned's the one who ran with it.

12:49.310 --> 12:52.104
The notion gave
that poor boy great comfort.

12:52.104 --> 12:54.607
I didn't leave because I went crazy.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.901
I left because I finally woke up.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.112
Well, I wouldn't know, would I?
You barely call--

13:00.112 --> 13:02.698
Because I know you don't believe
in anything I'm doing,

13:02.698 --> 13:04.658
becoming a writer, moving to New York.

13:04.658 --> 13:07.203
Must we get into all of this?

13:08.329 --> 13:11.123
The bottom line is people were furious

13:11.123 --> 13:12.875
with you when you left.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.044
They were furious with me.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.671
But when this story spread,

13:18.214 --> 13:21.509
it made all of that go away,

13:21.509 --> 13:23.803
and people liked you again,

13:24.386 --> 13:26.931
which is all I've ever wanted for you.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.854
<i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.648
Hey! Um, are you close?

13:35.648 --> 13:37.149
We should probably head out soon.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.485
Mm. (sighs) Listen, Miguel...

13:40.236 --> 13:41.070
I got...

13:41.737 --> 13:43.697
stuck at the bookstore.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.074
Phil is sick.

13:45.074 --> 13:47.368
Well... can't you get
somebody to cover for you?

13:47.368 --> 13:49.036
Believe me, I tried.

13:49.036 --> 13:51.622
Okay. I don't really know what to do.

13:51.622 --> 13:53.165
<i>I already RSVP'd.</i>

13:53.165 --> 13:54.834
<i>I told people we were gonna be there.</i>

13:54.834 --> 13:56.752
I know. I'm sorry. I--

13:57.253 --> 13:59.171
Do you think I wanna be here? Doing this?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.840
Hey, psst, psst. What do we think?

14:01.382 --> 14:03.133
Ooh, sorry. On the phone? Sor-- Mm.

14:03.133 --> 14:04.176
Who was that?

14:04.176 --> 14:05.261
Listen, I'm really sorry,

14:05.261 --> 14:06.679
but I-I-I have to go.

14:07.429 --> 14:08.806
- Bye.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.766
You know what? I'm gonna make one for you.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.019
Well, well, well.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.813
Color me impressed.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.190
Making her feel guilty
for not being able to come

14:18.190 --> 14:19.984
even though she doesn't have a choice?

14:20.317 --> 14:22.152
Yes! Nicely done!

14:22.152 --> 14:23.279
I'm an asshole.

14:23.279 --> 14:24.989
Obviously, the calculus on the <i>menage</i>

14:24.989 --> 14:26.156
has become a little bit thornier,

14:26.156 --> 14:29.034
but... I don't think it's impossible.

14:29.034 --> 14:30.619
Where's my marker?!

14:32.329 --> 14:33.664
<i>Well, you better get going.</i>

14:33.664 --> 14:35.291
My bus doesn't leave
for another half hour.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.458
We're really early,

14:36.458 --> 14:37.918
so can we just pop by the morgue?

14:37.918 --> 14:39.461
I wanna see Dad.

14:39.461 --> 14:40.963
Well, your father's very busy.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.215
You know, Christmas is almost here.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.009
The bodies are piling up,

14:45.009 --> 14:47.511
and the formaldehyde girl's
on maternity leave.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.179
Okay. Well, I'll just run in.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.059
Your father and I are not speaking...

14:54.518 --> 14:55.603
at the moment.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.897
What does that mean?

14:58.439 --> 15:00.691
We have been living apart.

15:01.984 --> 15:06.280
- Since when?
- Since a few months ago.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.282
Your father made a mistake.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.160
Not... with the formaldehyde--

15:11.160 --> 15:13.287
Oh god, no. Of course not.

15:13.287 --> 15:16.206
So, were you just gonna keep
this from me, like, forever?

15:16.206 --> 15:19.001
Well, are you happy now that you know?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.800
Who was that on the phone earlier?

15:27.676 --> 15:30.888
It was my... boyfriend, Miguel.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.098
You should've brought him along.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.725
No, he doesn't know
about any of this.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.018
I mean, he...

15:36.018 --> 15:39.146
he knows that I have
an ex named Ned, you know?

15:39.146 --> 15:42.733
He just doesn't know all the... details,

15:43.275 --> 15:44.985
which I'm obviously gonna tell him.

15:44.985 --> 15:47.154
I'm not keeping it from him.

15:47.154 --> 15:52.242
I just-- I haven't shared it... as of yet.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.412
We're not so different, you and me.

15:59.249 --> 16:01.877
I've said it a thousand times.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.848
- I thought you were sick.
- No, I'm good.

16:14.848 --> 16:16.725
But my dad is still messed up.

16:16.725 --> 16:19.019
They think it might be testicular cancer,

16:19.019 --> 16:21.855
but the old coot
won't let anyone see his nuts.

16:21.855 --> 16:24.817
- Okay. Is, is Lindsay--
- Lindsay bailed on me.

16:26.318 --> 16:27.736
She said she had some kind of

16:27.736 --> 16:29.530
personal business to take care of.

16:29.530 --> 16:31.615
- ♪

16:37.204 --> 16:38.205
Thanks.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.589
I knew it! I knew she was trouble.

16:47.589 --> 16:49.800
Pull your jacket over your face
so no one can see you cry.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.593
No, no. Leave your jacket
right where it is.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.303
Nobody is crying a drop.

16:53.303 --> 16:55.389
You got a party to go to.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.224
- I'm not goin' to the party.
Okay,

16:57.224 --> 16:58.934
imagine when Lindsay comes home

16:58.934 --> 17:01.228
from finishing up
whatever it is she's doing.

17:01.228 --> 17:03.355
She's obviously
having sex with someone else.

17:03.355 --> 17:06.233
And you're not sitting up
like some sad, little puppy dog.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.027
No! You're at a party.

17:08.027 --> 17:09.653
You are havin' the time of your life

17:09.653 --> 17:11.447
with your exceedingly attractive

17:11.447 --> 17:13.365
and exceedingly open to doing all kinds

17:13.365 --> 17:14.658
- of disgusting things

17:14.658 --> 17:16.785
you don't even know ex-girlfriend.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.662
She's hurt you

17:18.662 --> 17:19.872
for the last time.

17:19.872 --> 17:20.998
Enough is enough.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.124
There's that look.

17:22.124 --> 17:23.125
Just when you thought it was

17:23.125 --> 17:24.209
safe to go back in the water,

17:24.209 --> 17:25.961
the tiger shark returns.

17:34.970 --> 17:36.221
'Scuse me.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.019
- Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

17:42.019 --> 17:44.354
No. You don't get to jump.

17:44.354 --> 17:45.606
I hate you.

17:45.814 --> 17:48.609
- Making this game without you sucked.
- I know.

17:49.777 --> 17:53.906
So, it's true what they say.
You really are a banker now.

17:53.906 --> 17:56.283
Yeah, I really am a banker.

17:56.283 --> 18:00.037
You're like the nerd that went
to college and came back a stud.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.748
Okay, I was always a stud.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.211
I'm really sorry I didn't get
to finish the game with you.

18:07.211 --> 18:08.837
Do you miss it?

18:10.672 --> 18:11.924
Maybe a little.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.387
Hey.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.264
Hey.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.781
I hereby take my leave, Linds.

18:36.740 --> 18:39.493
You are officially unblocked.

18:39.493 --> 18:40.911
You can go back to your book...

18:41.703 --> 18:44.623
go back to Miguel, who's none the wiser.

18:47.167 --> 18:49.503
I still don't know
how to end the book, though.

18:49.503 --> 18:50.879
Oh, you'll figure it out.

18:50.879 --> 18:52.589
Everyone's gonna love it.

18:54.007 --> 18:55.676
Just like everything else you do.

18:59.596 --> 19:02.015
That's why I'm stuck.

19:03.100 --> 19:08.105
Trying... to make something
that everyone will love,

19:08.772 --> 19:11.984
trying to be something
that everyone will love.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.821
You're not my block.

19:17.322 --> 19:18.532
I am.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.037
Good luck with that.

We're just about to head to the sap ball.

22:19.796 --> 22:20.881
Yeah.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.468
I think I'm gonna mess all that up.

22:27.721 --> 22:29.723
I can't believe you're buying a place.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.932
That's insane.

22:30.932 --> 22:33.643
I mean, there's still a few steps left,

22:33.643 --> 22:36.855
but... I got lucky with the promotion.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.149
I don't want this
to come out the wrong way,

22:39.900 --> 22:43.195
but... I never expected any of this.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.906
I thought you'd be working
in indie games for life.

22:47.616 --> 22:51.036
And I'm sorry... for everything.

22:51.453 --> 22:54.664
- What happened with me and Orson--
- Orson?!

22:56.708 --> 22:58.919
My name is Orson?!

22:59.711 --> 23:00.837
What the--

23:00.837 --> 23:03.924
I recognize what an utter asshole I was.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.759
Total asshole.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.052
That's exactly the word

23:07.052 --> 23:09.054
- I was thinking, actually.

23:09.554 --> 23:11.973
So, why isn't your plus-one here?

23:11.973 --> 23:14.559
You know... personal business.

23:14.559 --> 23:17.479
Are you two... serious?

23:19.314 --> 23:21.149
I guess I don't really know

23:21.691 --> 23:24.111
how serious we are, to be honest.

23:25.112 --> 23:29.324
And now, I'm living an authentic life.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.245
Leaving you was not easy, but...

23:34.162 --> 23:36.039
it was definitely the right choice.

23:36.039 --> 23:38.125
So, all the things you said,

23:39.376 --> 23:40.710
everything you did,

23:42.045 --> 23:45.173
that wasn't because
of inflammation in your brain?

23:45.173 --> 23:47.217
I know it feels shitty now.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.804
But isn't it kind of better this way?

23:51.054 --> 23:52.889
You know, knowing the truth?

23:53.265 --> 23:54.474
Don't you feel

23:55.058 --> 23:56.059
kinda

23:56.893 --> 23:58.145
relieved?

24:00.355 --> 24:01.815
I feel,

24:03.692 --> 24:05.444
I feel like I really just

24:07.696 --> 24:08.947
hate you.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.158
That's okay.

24:12.200 --> 24:13.535
It's gonna take time.

24:13.994 --> 24:16.455
- Come here.
- What the fuck are you doing?

24:16.455 --> 24:20.083
Oh, you really hate me. Okay... um.

24:26.965 --> 24:28.717
I'm gonna take off.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.052
Actually, have a thing.

24:31.052 --> 24:33.138
- Back door open?
- It's unlocked.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.268
Hey! Come dance!

24:38.393 --> 24:39.603
You owe me, fucker!

24:39.603 --> 24:41.313
- No!
Come on!

25:07.547 --> 25:11.218
I should probably--
It's late. I should go.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.636
No, don't go.

25:17.182 --> 25:18.850
I shouldn't have come here.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.397
Miguel?
