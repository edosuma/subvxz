<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:34.076 --> 00:35.703
Ahh...

00:35.702 --> 00:38.672
Now let's work on
your fire safety.

00:38.664 --> 00:41.292
See this?

00:41.291 --> 00:42.918
Ahh...

00:42.918 --> 00:45.137
Don't ever play with this.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.723
I told you, I am ready
to come back to work.

00:48.715 --> 00:51.719
I just need to work around
the baby's schedule.

00:51.718 --> 00:55.564
Well, she falls asleep between
8:00 and 10:00 in the morning

00:55.556 --> 00:56.682
and then again at 1:30.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.684
And if I'm away
from the baby too long,

00:58.684 --> 01:00.686
I'll need 15-minute cry breaks.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.688
Oh, no, it's fine, it's fine.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.441
I-I just need a little cry.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.319
Oh, I see.

01:09.403 --> 01:11.576
What's wrong, baby doll?

01:11.572 --> 01:14.667
Jack says he has to give
my barber chair to someone else

01:14.658 --> 01:17.411
until my schedule normalizes.

01:18.662 --> 01:21.256
I worked so hard to be
a hairstylist, Lucky.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.625
It's who I am.

01:22.624 --> 01:26.254
Maybe it's time to exit
the hairstyling industry.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.881
They keep restricting
what barbers can do.

01:28.880 --> 01:31.679
My guy said he can
no longer perform dentistry.

01:34.011 --> 01:35.684
<i>Let us pray.</i>

01:35.679 --> 01:40.185
And remember, we are bowing our
heads to pray, not text-message.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.652
Yeah, I see you,
Mr. and Mrs. Sneaky.

01:42.811 --> 01:44.154
That's right.

01:44.146 --> 01:45.523
Well, look at Grandma.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.364
Oh, the world can be so cruel.

01:49.359 --> 01:50.952
I loved that job.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.697
When I cut hair,
people said they liked it,

01:53.697 --> 01:55.620
and it made me feel good.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.664
All Gracie does
is throw up on me.

01:57.826 --> 01:59.669
We just have to find you
a new job,

01:59.828 --> 02:02.297
the kind that lets you
bring your pets to work

02:02.289 --> 02:03.711
but defines "pets" very loosely.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.460
No, no, no.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.712
Come on, Jakey!

02:07.711 --> 02:08.711
Mommy loves you.

02:09.713 --> 02:10.839
Mommy loves you!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.216
Peek-a-boo!
Use your baby signs!

02:12.215 --> 02:13.592
Please stop,
I'll give you anything.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.355
Look, Gracie!

02:18.347 --> 02:20.645
It's the Manger Babies!

02:21.933 --> 02:23.651
There's Obadiah the Donkey.

02:23.810 --> 02:24.777
"Meow."

02:26.063 --> 02:27.690
And Hosea the Cat.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.943
"Well blimey, you
mixed them up."

02:32.069 --> 02:33.070
Well, you're right,

02:33.070 --> 02:34.538
Sir Reginald Featherbottom.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.701
I'll try that again.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.698
"Smashing."

02:36.698 --> 02:38.325
Luanne, you're an angel.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.327
I wish I could just buy you!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.626
One day, I promise you,

02:43.622 --> 02:46.592
you will be able to do
an approximation of just that.

02:49.044 --> 02:52.344
I've always wanted to be
a children's entertainer.

02:52.339 --> 02:55.434
It's so much more tasteful
than the other kinds.

02:55.425 --> 02:57.052
Look, just because a few moms

02:57.052 --> 02:59.100
like something, it doesn't mean

02:59.096 --> 03:01.019
you have to go
and start a business.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.359
Hank, this is just
what modern moms do.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.524
They become mom-preneurs.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.694
Mostly because it sounds cool,
but also to get rich quick.

03:09.690 --> 03:13.365
I fully support Luanne's
ambition to be the breadwinner,

03:13.360 --> 03:16.864
since I'm starting to realize
the liability lawsuit game

03:16.863 --> 03:18.706
is best left to the young.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.119
I'm so happy!

03:22.119 --> 03:25.714
I'm going to have a baby
and a career,

03:25.706 --> 03:28.585
just like Cosmo magazine
told me to do.

03:30.293 --> 03:33.137
I can hear you judging me
through your breath, Uncle Hank.

03:33.130 --> 03:34.928
But I'll prove
your breath wrong.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.266
I'm gonna make it.

03:36.258 --> 03:37.680
Come on, babies!

03:41.179 --> 03:42.852
Luanne and the Manger Babies

03:42.848 --> 03:45.442
are gonna be some kind
of children's group.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.654
And I'm gonna have to be
Gracie's mother and father.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.363
I'm like a seahorse.

03:50.355 --> 03:52.403
Why can't Luanne just fail

03:52.399 --> 03:54.652
at selling Tupperware
like normal moms?

03:54.818 --> 03:56.570
I respect puppets.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.698
They say the things
the rest of us only think.

03:58.697 --> 04:00.620
A puppet saved my life once.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.498
Gentlemen,

04:03.493 --> 04:06.246
I stand before you
an inspired man.

04:06.246 --> 04:10.547
Luanne has rekindled my yen
to write a children's book.

04:10.542 --> 04:13.716
Children see the world
through innocent eyes.

04:13.712 --> 04:15.714
My book will change that.

04:24.890 --> 04:28.690
"I know that hurt, but not
as much as polio would!"

04:29.853 --> 04:31.696
And that was Luanne.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.692
She is available
for parties and...

04:34.691 --> 04:36.614
People weren't
taking the fliers,

04:36.777 --> 04:39.621
so I tried slipping them
into their pockets.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.456
They did not like that at all.

04:41.448 --> 04:43.621
Be patient, Luanne.

04:43.617 --> 04:44.869
It's like a flu virus.

04:44.868 --> 04:47.963
It just takes one kid to catch
you and then they all will.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.968
Oh, look, Diya, an octopus!

04:52.959 --> 04:54.085
How about that?!

04:55.462 --> 04:57.885
"Gurgle gurgle."

04:59.925 --> 05:01.723
Diya's birthday party
is coming up,

05:01.718 --> 05:03.641
and I'm through
with hiring clowns.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.681
The last one didn't
wear enough makeup,

05:05.680 --> 05:07.933
and too much of his inner pain
showed through.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.105
Are you available?

05:09.100 --> 05:12.070
I promise to wear
tons of makeups!

05:14.105 --> 05:17.985
So, we hope you remember
everything we taught you today

05:17.984 --> 05:22.581
about not eating bugs
and picking up your toys

05:22.572 --> 05:24.370
and conflict resolution.

05:24.366 --> 05:26.118
Bye-bye!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.917
Hello, Luanne.

05:29.913 --> 05:31.711
John Redcorn!

05:31.706 --> 05:33.049
Are you performing here, too?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.385
They could not afford me.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.220
I'm here scouting new acts.

05:37.212 --> 05:38.714
And you wowed me.

05:38.713 --> 05:42.263
Did you know "wow"
upside down is "mom?"

05:42.259 --> 05:43.727
I believe you.

05:43.718 --> 05:47.063
I want to produce a line of
educational children's videos

05:47.055 --> 05:49.057
to turn you
and the Manger Babies

05:49.057 --> 05:51.401
into the next Baby Einstein.

05:51.393 --> 05:54.693
I'm talking DVDs,
merchandising, the works.

05:54.688 --> 05:56.690
Wow.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.443
Will I have to move
to a factory in China?

05:59.442 --> 06:02.321
No, we can do it
all here in Arlen.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.243
I have a camera,
editing equipment

06:04.239 --> 06:07.618
and a bass guitar leftover
from a previous enterprise.

06:07.617 --> 06:11.588
Babies, we've been discovered!

06:20.589 --> 06:23.388
"And that's why
yellow was invented.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.011
So we'd know
when to eat bananas."

06:29.139 --> 06:31.608
What color do you think
we should do next?

06:31.766 --> 06:32.608
Purple?

06:32.767 --> 06:34.519
Hmm. Too advanced.

06:34.519 --> 06:35.691
Green?

06:35.687 --> 06:36.654
Brilliant.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.700
Hot off the presses--

06:44.696 --> 06:48.166
I.e. my staple gun--
Behold!

06:48.158 --> 06:50.707
Your very own copy
of my children's book

06:50.702 --> 06:52.670
<i>The Magic Bullet.</i>

06:52.662 --> 06:56.337
It'll be about a little gun
searching for her lost bullet.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.459
A classic

06:57.459 --> 06:59.382
mother-
daughter tale.

06:59.377 --> 07:00.720
Why?

07:00.712 --> 07:02.680
Follow along
as I read an excerpt.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.806
"Bunny was not like
other AK-47s.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.680
"Bunny was an AK that cared.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.559
<i>"Other guns shot
with reckless abandon,</i>

07:13.558 --> 07:16.528
<i>"but Bunny,
her bullets she spared.</i>

07:16.519 --> 07:19.398
<i>"Then one day things went awry,</i>

07:19.397 --> 07:22.071
<i>"and one of her bullets,
away she flied.</i>

07:24.694 --> 07:27.664
<i>"That magic bullet
was her daughter Lips,</i>

07:27.822 --> 07:32.419
<i>with whom she had a complex
interdependent relationship.</i>

07:32.410 --> 07:34.538
<i>"She went searching for her.</i>

07:49.219 --> 07:52.268
It's a little stupid, Dale.

07:58.687 --> 08:01.611
Why is this nonsense so popular?

08:01.773 --> 08:04.117
Sticking babies in front of TVs

08:04.109 --> 08:05.861
can't be good for their brains.

08:05.860 --> 08:08.989
Hank, today's parents just need
a little ten-minute break

08:08.989 --> 08:12.209
now and then, even if it means
a slightly dumber kid.

08:12.200 --> 08:13.417
That's right.
I don't care.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.878
I'm so very tired.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.122
Hey, Uncle Hank,
want to buy my DVD?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.295
Sorry, I sold out.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.884
Luanne, I am so proud of you.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.005
You know, I could've listened
to you, Uncle Hank.

08:25.005 --> 08:29.260
But instead, I chose to succeed
in DVDs and in life.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.478
I'm finally a somebody!

09:12.719 --> 09:14.687
Okay, I need a break.

09:14.679 --> 09:18.149
Uh, please will you open up
my fan mail for me, Bobby?

09:18.141 --> 09:20.644
Need to protect
the money makers.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.940
All right.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.564
Trevor, age six, writes...

09:24.564 --> 09:25.941
Whoops, wrong house.

09:27.150 --> 09:28.868
Uh, but since I'm here,

09:28.860 --> 09:31.704
perhaps you should know
that you inspired me

09:31.696 --> 09:33.539
to write a kid's book, Luanne.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.874
Oh.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.870
Well, I'll have to
check it out sometime.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.462
Um, Bobby...

09:39.454 --> 09:40.706
Excuse me.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.958
Luanne isn't taking
visitors right now.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.709
Will you get John Redcorn
to read it?

09:44.709 --> 09:46.086
Please? I'm begging you!

09:46.086 --> 09:49.181
This is my one shot to share
my heart with the world!

09:49.172 --> 09:51.345
This is kind of beneath me,

09:51.341 --> 09:54.436
but I'll see if I could
get around to it.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.395
Luanne, you've made me
the happiest

09:56.387 --> 09:59.607
exterminator/children's author
in Arlen!

09:59.599 --> 10:00.896
Aw!

10:00.892 --> 10:03.691
The little people
are so touching.

10:03.686 --> 10:06.656
I don't mean children,
I mean unimportant people.

10:09.067 --> 10:11.069
All right, what's the emergency?

10:11.069 --> 10:14.448
I don't know how to say this,
so I'll just say it.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.074
I've got a rolling baby.

10:16.074 --> 10:16.870
What?

10:20.703 --> 10:23.627
Every time I set Gracie down,
she rolls.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.337
I don't know what to do.

10:25.333 --> 10:29.679
Look, Lucky, it's normal for
babies to do weird things.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.264
Babies are weird.

10:31.256 --> 10:32.678
Now, where's Luanne?

10:32.674 --> 10:34.551
Wh-Why isn't she
helping you with this?

10:34.551 --> 10:37.475
She's at a gig
or a photo shoot or something.

10:37.470 --> 10:41.225
I got to admit, dealing with
Gracie is harder than I thought.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.602
Uh-oh, here comes the thunder.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.698
I'll need help
taking off her onesie

10:48.690 --> 10:50.283
to address that twosie.

10:54.946 --> 10:57.699
Oh, I can't believe
I'm getting ready to go out

10:57.699 --> 11:00.248
and perform for hundreds
of my fans.

11:00.243 --> 11:04.419
Everyone loves me, and I don't
even have to love them back.

11:04.414 --> 11:07.714
I really do hope you get to
experience this one day, Bobby.

11:07.709 --> 11:10.713
You really think I can
be successful like you?

11:10.712 --> 11:12.259
Probably not.

11:12.255 --> 11:13.677
Okay, you're on.
Break a leg.

11:24.809 --> 11:25.981
Hello?

11:32.317 --> 11:34.570
That amphitheater
should have been full.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.367
Didn't you advertise the show?

11:36.362 --> 11:38.990
I-I put fliers
all over Gorilla Gulch.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.709
Babies have
short attention spans.

11:41.701 --> 11:44.079
They're onto the next thing,
just like that.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.580
They're ruthless.

11:45.580 --> 11:47.708
But fame doesn't just go away.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.505
That's not how it works.

11:49.500 --> 11:52.720
Look, the DVDs are just
not selling, anymore.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.714
That is why no one came,

11:54.714 --> 11:57.763
and also why
I must cancel your second DVD.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.932
What?
You can't do that.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.305
You need us.

12:05.308 --> 12:06.685
Look at this big dummy.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.686
Thinks he's gonna impress you
by drinking water.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.404
Who are all these people?

12:10.396 --> 12:11.648
The next you.

12:16.694 --> 12:19.163
Give me one more chance.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.657
Okay.

12:20.657 --> 12:23.001
But I expect you
to bring back the "wow."

12:22.992 --> 12:25.120
We already go straight to DVD.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.666
There is nowhere left to go.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.885
How about this idea?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.503
We've tried colors.

12:33.503 --> 12:34.720
Let's move on to words.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.884
Syrup!

12:37.799 --> 12:39.142
Brunch!

12:39.133 --> 12:41.431
That is a terrible idea.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.680
I mean, it's sweet
that you're trying to help.

12:43.680 --> 12:45.523
Sweet and annoying.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.017
And unhelpful.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.020
Do not worry. Peggy Hill
is on damage control.

12:50.019 --> 12:52.989
I think we should go after
new demographics

12:52.981 --> 12:56.235
by introducing new characters.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.704
This one will target the
crippled and blind and Hispanic.

12:59.696 --> 13:02.074
And this one
will target mean girls.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.710
Luanne, why don't you
take a little break?

13:05.702 --> 13:07.045
Your family needs you.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.880
Maybe I have been
ignoring my family.

13:12.875 --> 13:15.344
But I don't want it
to be for nothing.

13:15.336 --> 13:19.716
That's why I can't let
this just slip away!

13:19.716 --> 13:21.764
That's why you need this.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.683
Does this doll
make my hand a slut?

13:24.679 --> 13:28.104
Yes. But for the sake
of educating children.

13:28.099 --> 13:32.354
"Yo. Let's meet
my cool friends.

13:32.353 --> 13:35.106
This is Hosea the...
cool cat."

13:35.106 --> 13:36.608
"'Sup?"

13:36.774 --> 13:38.697
"Obadiah the stallion."

13:38.693 --> 13:40.536
"'Sup?"

13:40.528 --> 13:42.246
"Reggie-Reg the bloke."

13:42.238 --> 13:44.411
"Bangers 'n' mash, yo."

13:44.407 --> 13:46.580
"And...
Gurgle Gurgle...

13:46.576 --> 13:51.332
the... octopus"?

13:51.331 --> 13:54.710
"Um, like, Gurgle Gurgle's
kind of baby-ish.

13:54.709 --> 13:58.509
But whatever, seriously."

13:59.797 --> 14:02.300
"Do you really think so,
Chablis?"

14:09.390 --> 14:14.988
I'm sorry, Gurgle Gurgle,
but this is my last chance.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.107
I'm sorry.

14:21.069 --> 14:23.242
Now we just need
some new stories.

14:23.237 --> 14:26.616
Some Sir Reginald Featherbottom
versus the system thing.

14:26.783 --> 14:30.583
Yeah, I guess we should go edgy.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.966
You know,
I do have one new idea.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.959
About a little gun.

14:45.259 --> 14:48.058
We just sanitized.

14:48.054 --> 14:49.021
Aw!

14:53.643 --> 14:54.690
Thank you

14:54.685 --> 14:57.689
for attending a screening
of my new DVD,

14:57.688 --> 15:00.316
The Manger Babes.

15:03.945 --> 15:05.697
Yo. Hi.

15:05.696 --> 15:07.118
I'm Luanne.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.709
And these are the Manger Babes.

15:09.700 --> 15:11.168
Chablis the brat.

15:11.160 --> 15:14.585
This is like so, such as...

15:16.374 --> 15:17.967
You'll have to excuse her.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
She's stressing
'cause she's two-timing

15:19.961 --> 15:22.134
on Hosea with Reggie-Reg.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.848
What the hell is this?

15:23.840 --> 15:27.811
I think it works because it
doesn't lie to my generation.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.224
It's real.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.518
No, it's not.
It's smut.

15:31.514 --> 15:32.606
I don't know, Uncle Hank.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.564
Smut isn't usually
this sophisticated.

15:35.560 --> 15:36.686
Sorry I'm late.

15:36.686 --> 15:39.189
I was scared of being early.

15:39.188 --> 15:43.034
And finally,
our newest Manger Babe:

15:43.025 --> 15:46.655
Bangor, a gun that cares.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.714
That was John Redcorn.

16:04.714 --> 16:08.890
He wants me and "The Babes"
to do another DVD.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.683
I'm back, Lucky!

16:10.678 --> 16:13.022
Oh, that's great, baby doll.

16:13.014 --> 16:16.063
Coincidentally, I've got
something you'll want to hear.

16:16.058 --> 16:19.688
Gracie fell asleep with
her butt up in the air again.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.939
I'll grab the camera.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.236
Oh, you know what?

16:23.232 --> 16:26.281
I want to tell the Babies about
what Redcorn said first.

16:28.863 --> 16:31.707
"Luanne, you stole my dreams.

16:31.699 --> 16:36.170
If you want to ever see your
Manger Babies again, meet me

16:36.162 --> 16:38.540
at the Laundromat. Dale."

16:46.547 --> 16:48.720
Give me back my Babies, Dale!

16:48.716 --> 16:49.888
Too late!

16:49.884 --> 16:51.602
You say they're dry clean only,

16:51.594 --> 16:54.643
but these Babies are dirty
from the inside out.

16:54.805 --> 16:56.648
What?

17:19.704 --> 17:22.675
I want to thank you for coming

17:22.666 --> 17:25.715
to celebrate the life
of the Manger Babies.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.713
What the hell are we doing here?

17:27.713 --> 17:29.886
We're here to
support Luanne, Hank.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.225
Poor thing.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.720
All of her loved ones
end up rotting in jail

17:33.719 --> 17:35.471
or dying in the dryer.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.973
Oh, Lord.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.226
The nerve of that man!

17:40.101 --> 17:41.227
Murderer!

17:41.227 --> 17:42.695
Assassin of hope!

17:42.687 --> 17:45.315
You are not invited to the Babies...
Stealer! Plagiarer!

17:45.314 --> 17:46.861
You're both acting like idiots.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.451
You shouldn't
have stolen Dale's ideas.

17:49.443 --> 17:51.696
You shouldn't
have taken Luanne's dolls.

17:51.696 --> 17:55.041
We shouldn't even be
having this memorial service.

17:57.159 --> 17:59.127
You're right.
Put it like that...

17:59.120 --> 18:00.713
I'm sorry.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.083
I didn't mean to steal
your idea, Mr. Gribble.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.709
I just got desperate.

18:04.709 --> 18:07.633
I guess that's what happens
when you sell your soul

18:07.628 --> 18:09.221
for a taste of success.

18:09.213 --> 18:13.719
Wow, that would've been a great
story for the Manger Babies

18:13.718 --> 18:15.720
if I hadn't
brutally murdered them.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.688
Oh, well, what are you gonna do?

18:17.680 --> 18:19.978
I don't know who I am anymore.

18:19.974 --> 18:23.695
I'm like an asteroid
drifting in space

18:23.686 --> 18:26.530
without a puppeting career.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.492
Well, this
should cheer you up, Luanne.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.712
Oh, the Manger Babies
loved it here.

18:41.704 --> 18:45.459
The singing mechanical bears
full of technology.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.176
The pizza.

18:50.212 --> 18:52.055
Hello, John Redcorn.

18:52.048 --> 18:55.268
Are you here scouting new acts?

18:55.259 --> 18:57.682
Soccer party weekend
is like my Super Bowl.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.227
I'm very sorry
things did not work out.

19:00.222 --> 19:02.691
Please, let me send
a pitcher to your table.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.276
I'm sorry.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.690
I don't know who I am anymore,

19:05.686 --> 19:08.314
so I don't know
what soda I'd like.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.611
All right, Luanne, enough.

19:13.778 --> 19:17.078
Forget this nonsense
about finding yourself.

19:17.073 --> 19:20.373
You don't have the luxury of
figuring out who you are.

19:20.368 --> 19:22.712
You're a mother now.
That's who you are.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.708
But, Uncle Hank, I thought...
All the magazines said...

19:26.707 --> 19:28.550
And the talk shows...

19:28.542 --> 19:30.465
Look, it doesn't matter
if you stay at home

19:30.461 --> 19:31.883
or if you work, or whatever.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.256
You're a mom now.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.724
I mean, I'm a dad first,
no matter what.

19:35.716 --> 19:39.061
Even if this country
ran only on propane

19:39.053 --> 19:43.024
and made me its vice president,
I would still be a dad first.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.187
Okay?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.693
And you'd be an uncle second.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.566
Well, fourth, actually.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.676
I can't believe it's really you.

20:12.253 --> 20:14.722
Hello, my former fans.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.557
I bet you thought I'd fall apart

20:16.549 --> 20:18.096
when you deserted me,
didn't you?

20:18.092 --> 20:19.594
Well, guess what?

20:19.593 --> 20:20.719
I did.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.347
But not anymore!

20:22.346 --> 20:24.394
I don't need y'all
to tell me who I am

20:24.390 --> 20:26.563
because Uncle Hank
helped me remember.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.813
And me and Gurgle Gurgle
don't need you anymore.

20:37.695 --> 20:41.199
I'm glad we're done with
our go-go lifestyle.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.121
Besides, I never told you this,

20:43.117 --> 20:45.711
but I didn't care for
that British penguin.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.626
He was so demanding.

20:47.621 --> 20:50.215
Always asking for his marmalade.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.681
Oh, don't cry.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.800
Look, Gracie,
Gurgle Gurgle is here

20:58.799 --> 21:02.394
to tell you all about
his glorious travels.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.060
"Gurgle Gurgle."

21:05.055 --> 21:07.478
You see,

21:07.475 --> 21:10.695
<i>Gurgle Gurgle
only has six tentacles.</i>

21:10.686 --> 21:15.408
<i>So, he went on an adventure
to find the other two...</i>

21:54.688 --> 21:56.110
<i>I respect puppets.</i>

21:56.106 --> 21:57.653
<i>A puppet saved my life once.</i>

22:00.500 --> 22:08.500
