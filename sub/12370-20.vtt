00:02.627 --> 00:03.920
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:04.003 --> 00:05.755
IN FRONT
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.466
- WE'RE FINALLY ALONE.

00:08.550 --> 00:11.219
I HAVE BEEN WANTING THIS
FOR SO LONG.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.763
- YOU'RE AMAZING.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.267
- CUT!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.936
SO, KEN,
WHAT'S WITH ALL THE KISSING?

00:20.019 --> 00:22.063
- IT'S IN YOUR SCRIPT.

00:22.147 --> 00:24.441
- YEAH?
WELL, NOW IT'S OUT.

00:24.524 --> 00:26.818
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO REASON
WHY THEY SHOULD BE KISSING.

00:26.901 --> 00:30.488
- IT'S THE HONEYMOON SCENE.

00:30.572 --> 00:33.283
- YEAH, WELL, LOVERBOY HERE
IS ALL WRONG FOR THE PART.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.618
- J.J., THAT'S NOT HOW
YOU AUDITION PEOPLE.

00:35.702 --> 00:37.120
YOU SAY HOW WONDERFUL
THEY ARE

00:37.203 --> 00:38.371
AND WAIT UNTIL THEY LEAVE
BEFORE YOU TALK

00:38.455 --> 00:40.790
ABOUT HOW BAD THEY WERE.

00:40.874 --> 00:41.750
THIS IS ALL NEW TO HIM.

00:41.833 --> 00:44.836
- I'M GOING TO GO.

00:44.919 --> 00:47.338
- THANKS.
YOU WERE WONDERFUL.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.468
WHAT A LOX.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.471
- SORRY.
I JUST GET SO JEALOUS.

00:54.554 --> 00:55.764
- WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.141
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.601
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO GET USED TO IT.

00:59.684 --> 01:00.977
I'M AN ACTRESS.

01:01.060 --> 01:02.937
I'VE DONE LOVE SCENES
WITH EVERYONE

01:03.021 --> 01:06.441
FROM GREG KINNEAR
TO JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.359
- WELL, I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
TO DO SOMETHING YOU DIDN'T DO

01:08.443 --> 01:09.819
WITH JEAN-CLAUDE VAN DAMME.

01:09.903 --> 01:12.864
- WELL, THAT'S NOT GOING
TO BE EASY.

01:12.947 --> 01:16.951
- I KNOW I SAID I WANTED US
TO TAKE IT SLOW,

01:17.035 --> 01:19.662
BUT I THINK I'M READY
TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.997
I WANT YOU TO MEET
MY CHILDREN.

01:21.080 --> 01:23.833
- OH, I WOULD LOVE THAT!
[laughs]

01:23.917 --> 01:25.126
YOU'VE TALKED
ABOUT THEM SO MUCH,

01:25.210 --> 01:26.669
I FEEL I KNOW THEM ALREADY.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.296
TWO KIDS, RIGHT?

01:28.379 --> 01:31.674
- THREE. JUST LIKE YOU,
SO IT'S EASY TO REMEMBER.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.302
- YOU'D THINK.

01:35.845 --> 01:37.388
I HAVE A MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

01:37.472 --> 01:39.307
J.J. WANTS ME
TO MEET HIS CHILDREN.

01:39.390 --> 01:41.351
- [gasps]
OH, THAT'S WONDERFUL.

01:41.434 --> 01:43.186
- THIS IS A BIG STEP.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.855
I'M THE FIRST WOMEN HE'S DATED
SINCE THEIR MOTHER DIED.

01:45.939 --> 01:47.982
- OH, WELL,
MY ADVICE IS TO ACKNOWLEDGE

01:48.066 --> 01:49.359
THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM.

01:49.442 --> 01:54.030
- HIS DAUGHTER IS
A LITTLE CHUBBY.

01:54.113 --> 01:55.657
- NO, I WAS TALKING
ABOUT HIS WIFE.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.826
SHE JUST DIED A YEAR AGO.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.661
I'M SURE IT'S STILL
PRETTY RAW FOR THEM.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.372
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

02:02.455 --> 02:05.333
- UM, LET 'EM KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU ADMIRE HER

02:05.416 --> 02:08.086
AND WHAT AN HONOR IT IS
TO PORTRAY HER IN J.J.'S FILM.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.003
- THAT IS GOOD ADVICE,
MELANIE.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.174
- WELL, I AM
A PROFESSIONAL ADVICE GIVER.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.926
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
MY STATION MANAGER WANTS

02:15.009 --> 02:16.970
TO MEET WITH ME LATER
TO GO OVER SOME NEW IDEAS

02:17.053 --> 02:18.680
FOR THE RADIO SHOW.

02:18.763 --> 02:22.225
I THINK I'LL ORDER FRENCH FRIES
TO LET HIM KNOW I'M FUN.

02:22.308 --> 02:24.894
- YOU JUST WANT TO ORDER
FRENCH FRIES, DON'T YOU?

02:24.978 --> 02:28.398
- TO LET HIM KNOW I'M FUN.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.859
- HI.
- HEY, HOW DID THE EXAMS GO?

02:30.942 --> 02:32.443
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

02:32.527 --> 02:35.196
BUT IF WE DON'T PASS,
WE DON'T GRADUATE.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.906
- WHY ARE YOU SMILING, ELKA?

02:36.990 --> 02:41.536
- SHE'S FINDING IT VERY AMUSING
THAT I THINK I FAILED MY ORALS.

02:43.496 --> 02:46.040
- I WOULD HAVE SAID
SHE CHOKED ON HER ORALS.

02:48.501 --> 02:51.421
- IT'S BEEN LIKE THIS
FOR THE PAST HOUR.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.923
- WELL, IF JOY DOES FAIL
HER ORALS,

02:54.007 --> 02:56.217
THAT WOULD BE HARD TO SWALLOW.
[laughs]

02:58.511 --> 02:59.596
- YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE THE LAST PERSON

02:59.679 --> 03:01.890
I WOULD EXPECT
TO BLOW HER ORALS.

03:01.973 --> 03:04.434
[laughter]

03:04.517 --> 03:07.395
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE WAITED
UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE TO STUDY.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.440
- I GUESS YOU BIT OFF
MORE THAN YOU COULD CHEW.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.066
[laughter]

03:20.033 --> 03:22.327
- I'LL HAVE A BEER, PLEASE.
HEY.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.078
HOW ARE THE FRIES HERE?

03:24.162 --> 03:25.663
- I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T EAT FRIES.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.374
I JUST ORDERED THEM,
SO MY BOSS WOULD THINK I'M FUN.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.836
- YEAH, YOU SOUND FUN.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.922
OH, YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!

03:34.005 --> 03:37.717
OH, MY GRANDMA
COULD'VE HIT THAT!

03:37.800 --> 03:39.969
IDIOT JUST COST ME
$1,000 BUCKS!

03:40.053 --> 03:42.931
- I DON'T KNOW WHY GUYS GET
SO WORKED UP AT THESE GAMES.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.807
I MEAN THEY'RE GOING TO PLAY
EACH OTHER AGAIN AT SOME POINT.

03:44.891 --> 03:46.643
- AH.

03:46.726 --> 03:50.021
YOU SEE, THIS IS WHY
I WATCH SPORTS IN STRIP CLUBS.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.856
I MEAN,

03:51.940 --> 03:53.983
OBVIOUSLY NONE OF THE WOMEN
THERE ARE AS MUCH FUN AS YOU,

03:54.067 --> 03:57.445
BUT AT LEAST THEY TALK LESS.

03:57.528 --> 03:59.155
- STRIP CLUBS ARE
JUST DEPRESSING.

03:59.238 --> 04:00.949
- REALLY?
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN IN ONE?

04:01.032 --> 04:04.160
- WELL, YOU KNOW,
NOT TECHNI--NO.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.330
- I GO FIVE NIGHTS A WEEK.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.456
THE ONLY THING
THAT DEPRESSES ME

04:08.539 --> 04:10.833
IS THAT THEY DON'T
SERVE BREAKFAST.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.335
- OH, COULD YOU SIT
SOMEPLACE ELSE?

04:12.418 --> 04:14.379
MY STATION MANAGER IS HERE.
I'M ON THE RADIO.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.673
- HI, MELANIE.
- HI, TOM. HOW ARE YOU?

04:16.755 --> 04:20.009
- OH, I'M GREAT.
I SEE YOU TWO HAVE MET.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.302
- WHAT?
YOU--YOU KNOW HIM?

04:21.386 --> 04:23.137
- MELANIE, THIS IS FRANKIE.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.515
I JUST LURED HIM AWAY
FROM CHICAGO'S CWSR.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.642
- [mockingly]
I'M ON THE RADIO.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.189
- FRANKIE A POPULAR MORNING SHOW
CALLED <i> MAN TOWN.</i>

04:33.272 --> 04:35.024
- OH, GOD.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.026
{\an1}IS THAT THE SHOW WHERE THE WOMEN
GO ON AND PAINT THEIR BREASTS?

04:37.110 --> 04:38.444
THAT'S DEGRADING.

04:38.528 --> 04:39.654
- WHOA, OKAY, WHOA.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

04:39.737 --> 04:42.699
NOW, THEY DON'T PAINT
THEIR BREASTS.

04:42.782 --> 04:44.534
THEY PAINT WITH THEIR BREASTS.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.036
AND IT WASN'T DEGRADING.
IT WAS ART.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.871
- UNBELIEVABLE.

04:48.955 --> 04:49.747
- [laughs]
EXCUSE ME.

04:49.831 --> 04:50.999
IT WAS MORE INTERESTING
THAN YOUR SHOW.

04:51.082 --> 04:53.918
I MEAN, JEEZ, IF I WANTED TO
LISTEN TO A YAPPY ITALIAN WOMAN

04:54.002 --> 04:56.504
GIVE BORING ADVICE ALL DAY,
I'D CALL ANY OF MY SISTERS.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.215
- ARE YOU LISTENING TO THIS?

04:59.298 --> 05:00.591
- OH, I THINK
ALL OF CLEVELAND

05:00.675 --> 05:01.759
IS GOING TO WANT
TO LISTEN TO THIS.

05:01.843 --> 05:02.885
I WAS HOPING
THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.387
IT'S THE CLASSIC
BATTLE OF THE SEXES

05:04.470 --> 05:06.347
IN ONE EXPLOSIVE AFTERNOON SHOW.

05:06.431 --> 05:09.017
- WAIT, WAIT.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT--

05:09.100 --> 05:10.226
WANT ME TO COHOST A SHOW
WITH HIM?

{\an8}- HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED
TO MAKE ME FEEL BETTER?

05:41.299 --> 05:43.968

06:31.724 --> 06:34.102
MY DAD TALKS ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME,

06:34.185 --> 06:37.480

A SMILE ON HIS FACE AGAIN.

YOU KNOW, THIS PORTRAIT
OF YOUR MOTHER IS BEAUTIFUL.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.951
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR
TO PLAY HER.

06:50.034 --> 06:53.496
YOU KNOW, I THINK MY FAVORITE
LINE IN YOUR DAD'S MOVIE IS,

06:53.579 --> 06:56.124
"MY CHILDREN--
THEY ARE MY LIGHT,

06:56.207 --> 06:58.376
MY BREATH, MY EVERYTHING."

06:58.459 --> 07:00.753
- SHE USED TO SAY THAT
ALL THE TIME.

07:00.837 --> 07:02.964
[voice breaks]
I'M SO SORRY.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.882
- I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T MEAN TO UPSET HIM.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.636
- NO, IT'S OKAY.
HE'S A LITTLE EMOTIONAL.

07:08.719 --> 07:11.097
- HE'LL BE BACK.
LET'S HAVE A SEAT.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.025
- UM, IS EVERYTHING
ALL RIGHT?

07:23.109 --> 07:25.194

THAT WAS CONNIE'S CHAIR.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.071
WE STILL SET A PLATE FOR HER.

WAIT A MINUTE.
OKAY, PENNY, I HAVE AN IDEA.

INSTEAD OF WAITING ANOTHER
THREE YEARS FOR HIM TO PROPOSE,

08:19.081 --> 08:21.042
WHY DON'T YOU
PROPOSE YOURSELF?

08:21.125 --> 08:22.210
- NO.
NO, NO, NO.

08:22.293 --> 08:24.253

THAT A MAN WANTS A WOMAN

08:24.337 --> 08:27.215
TO GET DOWN ON HER KNEES,
AND IT AIN'T SO SHE CAN PROPOSE.

08:30.301 --> 08:31.052

WHY WOULD SHE LIE?

- ALL RIGHT.

YOU MIX IT WITH HIS SHAME

FOR OUR FIRST BREAK.

YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

09:18.266 --> 09:20.601
- YES.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.771
I MEAN, I DID.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.315
- I'M SORRY.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.317
MAYBE THIS IS
A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.611
YOU COULD TELL HER
THAT THE STRIP CLUBS

09:30.695 --> 09:33.489
ARE YOUR WAY OF AVOIDING
THE INTIMACY

09:33.572 --> 09:36.826
THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.452
- WOW.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.870
YOU KNOW, THAT IS EXACTLY

09:39.954 --> 09:41.455
THE SORT OF CRAP THAT WOMEN
ALWAYS BUY.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.498
IT MIGHT JUST BE STUPID ENOUGH
TO WORK.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.625
THANK YOU.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.171
YOUR ADVICE WASN'T
STUPID ENOUGH TO WORK.

09:49.255 --> 09:50.381
IT WAS JUST STUPID.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.507
WHICH WAY
TO YOUR GUEST ROOM?

09:51.591 --> 09:52.967
- WAIT, WHAT?
NO.

09:53.050 --> 09:56.971
- FYI, I SLEEP IN THE NUDE.

09:57.054 --> 09:59.807
- FYI,

09:59.890 --> 10:02.018
I LIVE IN THE BACK.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.236
- I--I WOULD'VE GOT A HOTEL,

10:12.320 --> 10:13.863
BUT I KIND OF MAXED OUT
MY CREDIT CARDS.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.866
SO STAYING HERE
REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.201
HEY, MELANIE,
I DON'T LIKE DOWN PILLOWS!

10:19.285 --> 10:21.954
- SHUT UP!
YOU GET WHAT YOU GET!

10:22.038 --> 10:24.707
- SO SHE THE REASON
YOU GUYS LOOK SO SOUR?

10:24.790 --> 10:28.836
- OH, JOY ALWAYS LOOKS
THAT WAY.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.629
- WE'RE STUDENTS
AT CLEVELAND STATE,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.006
AND WE FLUNKED OUR FINALS.

10:32.089 --> 10:33.716
AND OUR PROFESSOR WON'T
GIVE US A RETEST.

10:33.799 --> 10:34.717
- OH.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.177
DID YOU TRY SEDUCING HIM?

10:36.260 --> 10:40.056
- EH, I IMPLIED CERTAIN THINGS,
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

10:40.139 --> 10:43.684
- SAME.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.561
- ALL RIGHT, PLAN B.

10:45.644 --> 10:46.771
TELL HIM THAT HIS CLASSROOM

10:46.854 --> 10:48.856
PROMOTED
UNBALANCED GENDER ISSUES.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.232
HE'LL BEG YOU
NOT TO REPORT THAT

10:50.316 --> 10:52.401
TO THE SCREECHING FEMINISTS
ON THE FACULTY BOARD.

10:52.485 --> 10:54.779
- WELL,
THAT'S JUST CHAUVINISTIC.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.239
BUT IT MIGHT WORK.

10:57.323 --> 11:00.076
- IT'S THE LEAST I CAN DO
FOR LETTING ME STAY WITH YOU.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.119
I DON'T LIKE
TINY SOAPS EITHER!

11:02.203 --> 11:05.915
- SHUT UP!
JUST SHUT UP!

11:05.998 --> 11:08.167
- YOU KNOW,
SHE'S JUST LIKE MY SISTERS.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.418
I COME
FROM A BIG ITALIAN FAMILY.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.046
- MY BOYFRIEND IS ITALIAN.

11:12.129 --> 11:13.756
HE'S A WIDOWER,

11:13.839 --> 11:16.592
AND I JUST MET HIS CHILDREN
FOR THE FIRST TIME TODAY.

11:16.675 --> 11:20.054
THEY ALL CRIED.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.056
- AH, IT COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE.
YOU COULD'VE SAT IN HER CHAIR.

11:22.139 --> 11:25.101
[chuckles]

11:25.184 --> 11:27.645
YOU SAT IN HER CHAIR.

11:27.728 --> 11:29.814
- BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
IT WAS HER CHAIR.

11:29.897 --> 11:33.109
- LOOK, TO THEM,
SHE'S STILL IN THAT CHAIR.

11:33.192 --> 11:36.153
WHEN ITALIAN WOMEN DIE,
THEY--THEY DON'T LEAVE.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.115
THEY STICK AROUND AND HAUNT
THEIR HUSBANDS FOREVER

11:39.198 --> 11:41.951
TO KEEP 'EM FROM BEING HAPPY.

11:42.034 --> 11:45.287
JUST LIKE THEY DID
WHEN THEY WERE ALIVE.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.998
- SO WHAT DO I DO?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.291
- INVITE THEM OVER HERE,

11:49.375 --> 11:51.085
WHERE THERE'S NO MEMORY
OF HIS LATE WIFE.

11:51.168 --> 11:52.086
I'LL COOK.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.463
- OH, THAT IS SO NICE OF YOU.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.633
- IT WORKED!
WE'RE GETTING THE RETEST.

11:57.716 --> 12:00.302
- WELL, HOW'S THAT GOING
TO HELP ME?

12:00.386 --> 12:03.264
- ELKA DISAGREES WITH SOMETHING
IN THE PROFESSOR'S TEXTBOOK,

12:03.347 --> 12:06.225
AND MELANIE'S ADVICE WAS THAT
TEACHERS LIKE TO BE CHALLENGED.

12:06.308 --> 12:08.144
- OH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.979
GUYS DON'T WANT
TO BE CHALLENGED.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.606
JUST TELL THE PROFESSOR
WHATEVER HE WANTS TO HEAR.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.817
MEN JUST WANT TO EAT,
DRINK, HAVE SEX,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.570
AND NOT HAVE
THEIR BALLS BUSTED.

12:17.653 --> 12:19.738
OH, SPEAKING OF,
HEY, MELANIE.

12:19.822 --> 12:21.449
- GO TO YOUR ROOM, FRANKIE.

12:21.532 --> 12:23.534
MY FRIENDS HAVE PROBLEMS,
AND THEY NEED MY ADVICE.

12:23.617 --> 12:26.078
- ACTUALLY, WE'RE GOOD.

12:27.538 --> 12:29.248
- FRANKIE SOLVED OUR PROBLEMS.

12:29.331 --> 12:30.166
- YEAH, IT'S KIND OF NICE

12:30.249 --> 12:33.335
GETTING THE MALE PERSPECTIVE
ON THINGS.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.171
- REALLY?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.630
BUT YOU ALWAYS COME
TO ME FOR ADVICE.

12:36.714 --> 12:37.548
I'M THE PROBLEM SOLVER.

12:37.631 --> 12:39.341
- OH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:39.425 --> 12:40.551
LET'S FORGET THAT I JUST
SOLVED EVERYBODY'S PROBLEMS

12:40.634 --> 12:41.844
IN UNDER THREE MINUTES,

12:41.927 --> 12:45.556
AND LET'S HEAR WHAT MELANIE
HAS TO SAY.

12:45.639 --> 12:47.266
- HOW LONG ARE YOU GOING
TO BE HERE?

12:47.349 --> 12:49.018
- A WHILE.

12:49.101 --> 12:49.977
MY GIRLFRIEND GAVE ME
A LOOK LIKE

12:50.060 --> 12:52.730
SHE WAS GONNA STAB ME
WITH AN ICE PICK.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.899
OH, THERE'S THE LOOK.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.865
- SO NICE TO MEET ALL OF YOU.
- THANK YOU.

13:02.948 --> 13:04.366
- I WONDER
WHAT'S KEEPING VICTORIA.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.744
- SHE'S DOING A HAIR
AND MAKEUP TEST FOR MY MOVIE.

13:06.827 --> 13:10.206
YOU KNOW, ANTHONY,
JOY AND ELKA ARE STUDENTS

13:10.289 --> 13:12.708
AT CLEVELAND STATE,
JUST LIKE GRANDPA.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.919
YOU TWO GET
YOUR FINAL EXAM GRADES BACK YET?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.546
- NO. THEY'LL BE POSTED
ONLINE TONIGHT.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.756
WE'RE ACTUALLY QUITE NERVOUS.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.050
- I THINK IT'S SO INSPIRING,

13:21.133 --> 13:22.676
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL
AT YOUR AGE.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.096
- SAY THANK YOU, JOY.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.392
- EVERYBODY, I MADE ANTIPASTI.

13:30.476 --> 13:33.270
- WE MADE ANTIPASTI,
AND IT'S DELICIOUS.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.689
WE HAVE MOZZARELLA.
- MOZZARELL.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.107
- PROSCIUTTO.
- PROZHUTE.

13:37.191 --> 13:38.234
- CAPPICOLA.
- GABA-GOOL.

13:38.317 --> 13:39.735
- WOULD YOU STOP?

13:39.818 --> 13:41.904
[sighs]
I'M SORRY.

13:41.987 --> 13:43.030
HI, I'M MELANIE.

13:43.113 --> 13:45.658
- AND I'M FRANKIE.
YOU MUST BE J.J.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.575
VICTORIA LET ME READ
YOUR SCRIPT.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.077
I THOUGHT IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.
- THANK YOU.

13:48.160 --> 13:49.453
- YOU KNOW,
FROM WHAT YOUR FATHER WROTE,

13:49.537 --> 13:50.955
YOUR MOTHER MUST HAVE BEEN
ONE HELL OF A BROAD.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.373
- OH, SHE WAS.

13:52.456 --> 13:54.083
HEY, YOU WANT TO SEE
A PICTURE OF HER?

13:54.166 --> 13:56.585
- OH, SURE.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.963
OH, NO OFFENSE, J.J.,

13:59.046 --> 14:02.216
BUT YOUR WIFE HAD
A GREAT RACK.

14:02.299 --> 14:03.217
- FRANKIE!

14:03.300 --> 14:05.928
- NO, HE'S RIGHT.

14:06.011 --> 14:07.388
SHE WAS PRETTY, WASN'T SHE?
- YEAH.

14:07.471 --> 14:09.890
- SHE WAS THE MOST PERFECT MOM
ANYONE COULD EVER--

14:09.974 --> 14:11.225
- HEY, HEY, NONE OF THAT.

14:11.308 --> 14:13.477
- MAYBE I SHOULD OPEN
ANOTHER BOTTLE OF WINE.

14:13.561 --> 14:16.939
- NO, LET ME DO THAT
FOR YOU, JOY.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.108
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
DAD'S RIGHT.

14:19.191 --> 14:22.778
WE ALL AGREED TO KEEP
OUR EMOTIONS IN CHECK TONIGHT.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.280
I MEAN, YES, WE LOVE MOM,

14:24.363 --> 14:28.117
BUT SHE IS NO LONGER
WITH US.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.165
- MOMMY, NANA WOKE UP!

14:41.839 --> 14:43.632
- I AM SO SORRY.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.302
I'M JUST DRESSED LIKE THIS
FOR THE MOVIE.

14:46.385 --> 14:47.928
I MEANT TO GET HOME
WITH PLENTY OF TIME TO CHANGE,

14:48.012 --> 14:49.471
BUT I'LL JUST GO DO THAT NOW.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.015
- NO, NO,
WAIT, WAIT.

14:51.098 --> 14:52.182
IT'S JUST...

14:52.266 --> 14:54.435
THIS MIGHT SOUND
A LITTLE STRANGE,

14:54.518 --> 14:57.146
BUT YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE MY MOTHER,

14:57.229 --> 14:59.815
AND IT JUST FEELS LIKE
SHE'S HERE.

14:59.898 --> 15:02.109
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
I WANT TO SAY TO YOU...

15:02.192 --> 15:04.194
HER...

15:04.278 --> 15:06.822
MOM.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.408
WOULD IT BE TOO WEIRD
IF I TOLD YOU?

15:09.491 --> 15:13.120
- IT MIGHT BE.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.122
- I GOT THAT PROMOTION, MOM.

15:15.205 --> 15:18.500
- OH, CONGRATULATIONS...LISA?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.419
- YEAH.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.506
- IS IT JUST ME, OR IS THIS
HEADING INTO A WEIRD AREA?

15:24.590 --> 15:27.009
-<i> HEADING</i> INTO?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.011
- YOU KNOW,
VICTORIA IS SO EXCITED

15:29.094 --> 15:30.387
TO PLAY YOUR MOTHER
IN THE MOVIE,

15:30.471 --> 15:32.848
BUT HOW ABOUT
SHE GOES AND CHANGES

15:32.931 --> 15:35.184
SO THAT WE CAN ALL HAVE
DINNER TOGETHER?

15:35.267 --> 15:37.353
- YES, I MADE A DELICIOUS
PUTTANESCA--PUTTANESC.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.064
- THAT'S NOT A THING.
- YOU'RE NOT A THING.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.526
[glass shatters]

15:44.610 --> 15:45.986
- CONNIE?

15:46.070 --> 15:48.947
- J.J., IT'S ME, VICTORIA.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.033
- RIGHT.

15:51.116 --> 15:53.702
[chuckles]
OF COURSE.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.162
SORRY, EVERYBODY.

15:55.245 --> 15:58.207
I'LL GET SOMETHING
TO CLEAN THAT UP.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.589
- J.J., ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.549
- SORRY, VICTORIA.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.053
FOR A MOMENT,
I THOUGHT IT WAS HER.

16:11.136 --> 16:12.388
- AND I SAW THE LOOK
IN YOUR EYES

16:12.471 --> 16:16.183
WHEN YOU THOUGHT I WAS HER.

16:16.266 --> 16:20.187
YOU'RE STILL IN LOVE WITH HER,
AREN'T YOU?

16:20.270 --> 16:23.524
- I AM.

16:23.607 --> 16:25.401
- WELL...

16:25.484 --> 16:29.738
I'LL JUST GO UP AND CHANGE,
AND--AND THEN WE'LL TALK.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.452
- [whispers]
YEAH.

16:37.996 --> 16:41.125
[phone rings]

16:41.208 --> 16:44.712
- [gasps] OH, MY GOD,
WE BOTH PASSED!

16:44.795 --> 16:47.089
I'M GOING TO GET
A COLLEGE DEGREE!

16:47.172 --> 16:48.882
OWEN AND WILBUR WILL BE
SO PROUD OF ME.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.386
- OH, I'VE GOTTA TEXT COACH.

16:55.013 --> 16:56.515
- THOUGHT I WAS READY,
VICTORIA.

16:56.598 --> 16:58.434
- YEAH, I KNOW.

16:58.517 --> 17:02.104
- THIS GRIEF THING--
DOESN'T COME WITH A PLAYBOOK.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.272
- I UNDERSTAND.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.900
I DON'T THINK I'M COMPLETELY
OVER EMMET EITHER.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.319
SO...
[sighs]

17:09.403 --> 17:12.448
IS THIS GOOD-BYE?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.575
- I DON'T WANT IT TO BE.

17:14.657 --> 17:16.617
YOU, THE MOVIE--I THINK
I JUST NEED TO PUT EVERYTHING

17:16.702 --> 17:18.619
ON HOLD FOR A BEAT.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.915
HOW ABOUT...NOT YET?

17:23.916 --> 17:27.628
- OKAY, NOT YET.

17:27.713 --> 17:31.216
THEY SAY IT TAKES HALF THE TIME
YOU WERE MARRIED TO GET OVER IT.

17:32.384 --> 17:35.095
- WOW. 16 YEARS.

17:35.179 --> 17:39.308
- THREE HOURS.

17:39.391 --> 17:42.644
AND, BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THAT
WASN'T MY SHORTEST MARRIAGE.

17:44.730 --> 17:47.983
WE'VE LIVED
VERY DIFFERENT LIVES.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.320
- WELL, I LIKE OUR DIFFERENCES.

17:51.403 --> 17:55.324
I'M GOING TO MISS YOU.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.451
EAT A SLICE OF PIZZA
EVERY NOW AND THEN.

17:57.534 --> 17:59.661
AND NO KNIFE AND FORK--
YOU JUST FOLD IT AND IN.

17:59.745 --> 18:01.163
- OKAY, I WILL.

18:01.246 --> 18:02.623
AND THE NEXT TIME
YOU GO TO THE DRUGSTORE

18:02.706 --> 18:04.875
AND SEE A SIX-PACK
OF TUBE SOCKS ON SALE,

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
JUST KEEP WALKING.
- [laughs]

18:06.627 --> 18:08.837
DEAL.

18:10.088 --> 18:12.508
WELL, I BETTER GET GOING.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.803
- NO. I DON'T WANT TO BE
THE ONE SITTING HERE

18:15.886 --> 18:17.638
WATCHING YOU WALK AWAY.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.848
- WELL, I DON'T WANNA WATCH YOU
WALK AWAY EITHER

18:19.932 --> 18:22.726
BECAUSE IT'LL REMIND ME OF...

18:22.810 --> 18:26.313
HOW MUCH I LIKE WATCHING YOU
WALK AWAY.

18:26.396 --> 18:29.316
- OKAY,
SO WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.904
OH, J.J.

18:36.448 --> 18:41.245
ON THREE.
ONE, TWO, THREE.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.045
- DON'T GET TOO HOLLYWOOD.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.881
- DON'T STAY TOO CLEVELAND.

19:01.598 --> 19:04.393
- WELL, J.J. AND I BROKE UP.

19:04.476 --> 19:07.563
- I'M SORRY.
- ME TOO.

19:07.646 --> 19:09.273
- DON'T WORRY.
I SAW THE WAY HE LOOKED AT YOU.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.357
HE'LL BE BACK.

19:10.440 --> 19:13.610
- OH, THAT'S SWEET, FRANKIE.

19:13.694 --> 19:15.112
- WELL, UM,

19:15.195 --> 19:18.240
IT'S BEEN REALLY GOOD FOR ME
BEING AROUND YOU GUYS.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.242
ACTUALLY, YOU'VE INSPIRED ME
TO GO HOME

19:20.325 --> 19:21.910
AND MAKE THINGS RIGHT
WITH THE GIRLFRIEND.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.912
- SO YOU'RE GOING TO TELL HER
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GO

19:23.996 --> 19:25.747
TO STRIP CLUBS ANYMORE?
- DAMN STRAIGHT.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.083
- AND YOU'RE ACTUALLY NOT GOING
TO GO TO STRIP CLUBS ANYMORE?

19:28.166 --> 19:31.253

THAT'S GOING TO BE A PROBLEM.

19:31.336 --> 19:36.425
BUT ALL KIDDING ASIDE,
MELANIE,

19:36.508 --> 19:38.927
YOU'RE A FANTASTIC ITALIAN GIRL.

19:39.011 --> 19:42.431
YOU'RE TOO GOOD TO BE ALONE.

19:42.514 --> 19:43.724
- THANK YOU.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.225
- I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING
TO NEED A SWIFFER

19:45.309 --> 19:46.268
TO CLEAN OUT THE COBWEBS
DOWN THERE,

19:46.351 --> 19:50.105
BUT IT'LL HAPPEN SOMEDAY.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.445
- [chuckles]
LOVE YOU TOO, FRANKIE.

19:56.528 --> 19:58.196
- ALL RIGHT, WELL, ENOUGH
OF THIS. WHO WANTS SOME PIZZA?

19:58.280 --> 20:00.282
- I WOULD LOVE
A SLICE OF PIZZA.

20:00.365 --> 20:02.159
- I'LL GO AND GET YOU
A KNIFE AND FORK.

20:02.242 --> 20:04.286
- NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT HOW YOU EAT PIZZA.

20:04.369 --> 20:07.289
THIS IS HOW YOU EAT PIZZA.

20:14.379 --> 20:16.506
- THIS HAS BEEN FUN,

20:16.590 --> 20:19.134
