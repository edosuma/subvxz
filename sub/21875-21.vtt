00:08.870 --> 00:10.140
Yes, um...

00:10.140 --> 00:13.940
A tad less rum and a tinge
more Scotch, C.D.

00:13.940 --> 00:16.210
That is the Extra Reserve
you're using, isn't it?

00:19.880 --> 00:21.120
That's 5,000 even, right?

00:21.120 --> 00:23.320
Yes, precisely,
and you make the check out

00:23.320 --> 00:26.120

00:26.120 --> 00:27.450
C.D.:
You know, this old Ranger's

00:27.460 --> 00:28.760
been known to dabble
in the Dow

00:28.760 --> 00:29.890
every once in a while.

00:29.890 --> 00:31.960
Just, uh...

00:31.960 --> 00:33.830
how do you intend
to double that investment?

00:33.830 --> 00:37.360
Well, um...
as in any endeavor, C.D.,

00:37.370 --> 00:39.430
the mastery of high finance

00:39.440 --> 00:42.240
requires creativity
and diligence,

00:42.240 --> 00:44.540
professional skill,

00:44.540 --> 00:46.770
and just a pinch of luck.

00:46.780 --> 00:50.110
Much like concocting
this libation, I imagine.

00:51.580 --> 00:52.710
It--

00:52.710 --> 00:56.920
Too much Cointreau and,
uh, not enough bitters.

00:57.950 --> 00:59.350
Oh.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.450
Lovely.

01:00.460 --> 01:02.390
Quite...

01:02.390 --> 01:03.920
Quite lovely.

Walker.

01:11.900 --> 01:13.600
What are you doing here?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.270
I thought you were
away for a while.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.840
Yeah, well, much as I enjoy

01:16.840 --> 01:20.310
my time spent, um...abroad?

01:20.310 --> 01:22.040
You know what people say.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.710
All good things
must come to an end.

01:23.710 --> 01:26.310
Bye.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.250
I didn't know
you knew him, Walker.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.050
Shredder Stonham?
Oh, yeah, I know him.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.920
He's an all right kind of guy
for a con man.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.320
Just has a habit
of selling property

01:34.320 --> 01:36.320
he doesn't own.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.560
Hey, Trivette.
Yeah?

01:38.560 --> 01:40.730
Where's that investment
counselor we're supposed meet?

01:40.730 --> 01:43.230
Yeah, uh...

01:43.230 --> 01:44.230
Well...

01:44.230 --> 01:47.170
Um, he showed up
earlier, and...

01:47.170 --> 01:48.670
But don't worry because

01:48.670 --> 01:50.670
I already
put you in for half.

01:50.670 --> 01:53.110
You invested my money
without my permission?

01:53.110 --> 01:56.080
Relax.
It's a sure thing.

02:05.490 --> 02:09.090
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

02:23.710 --> 02:25.470
My people like
your merchandise.

02:25.470 --> 02:26.940
Yeah, how much
they like it?

02:26.940 --> 02:28.980
Five thousand.

02:28.980 --> 02:32.250
Five? Hey, we're talkin'
automatic rifles.

02:32.250 --> 02:35.720
M-16s, grenades, mines.
Five doesn't even cover

02:35.720 --> 02:37.180
the samples we gave you.

02:37.190 --> 02:39.050
Take it or leave it.

Hey, okay.

02:47.700 --> 02:48.700
All right. Okay. Wait.

02:48.700 --> 02:50.160
Wait a minute.
Okay!

02:51.970 --> 02:53.870
Maybe I could go to--
Shut up!

02:53.870 --> 02:57.140
Deal's off.
Where are the samples?

02:57.140 --> 02:58.140
In the Hummer.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.710
Troy ain't gonna like us
comin' up empty.

03:04.710 --> 03:06.650

come up empty?

WALKER:
I can't believe
you would invest my money

03:24.100 --> 03:25.130
without asking me.

03:25.130 --> 03:26.870
Come on. Walker,
how else are you gonna

03:26.870 --> 03:28.640
get that grazing land
you've had your eye on?

03:28.640 --> 03:30.140
Well, losing money
in the stock market

03:30.140 --> 03:31.470
is not one of the ways.

03:31.470 --> 03:33.440
We're not gonna lose.
And even if we do,

03:33.440 --> 03:35.610
I mean...

03:35.610 --> 03:37.040
...it's tax-deductible.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.610
Well, tell that
to my horse, Amigo,

03:38.610 --> 03:40.110
when he gets...

03:40.110 --> 03:41.780
When he gets hungry.

that's enough.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.530
All right,

it's all over, all right?

You had enough?

You had enough?

04:08.340 --> 04:10.280
Are you okay?
Yeah.

04:10.280 --> 04:12.210
Yeah. It's nothing.
It's nothing.

04:12.210 --> 04:14.110
I was in there hitting the suds
a little too good.

04:14.120 --> 04:15.520
You know, and I started
mouthing off

04:15.520 --> 04:17.380
about the Mavericks being
a bunch of losers.

No.

No, th-that's okay.

if I'm late, you know?

through his teeth.

smell like a brewery, did he?

Either that
or my nose is broken.

04:40.380 --> 04:42.380
Well, if you lose my money,

04:42.380 --> 04:44.210
that could be arranged.

to talk to you about that--

What's he doing here?

06:47.770 --> 06:49.070
Is he up to his
old tricks again?

06:49.070 --> 06:50.900
No.

06:50.910 --> 06:53.210
He's an independent
investment counselor now.

06:53.210 --> 06:56.280
He's offered to come up--
Oh, wait a minute.

06:56.280 --> 06:59.010
Did you say
"investment counselor"?

06:59.010 --> 07:00.110
Yes.
Yes.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.150
Yes.

07:01.150 --> 07:02.420
I got him into
a training program

07:02.420 --> 07:03.720
when he was paroled.

07:03.720 --> 07:05.620
The man has
rehabilitated himself.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.550

more that that.

fought for me

07:33.450 --> 07:35.980
by, uh, a member
of the fairer sex.

I'm not a member

Indeed you are.

been for you,

and you paid it.

Oh, quite true.
Quite true. Yes. Yes.

nurture for you.

of real slimebags.

I'll sign.

14:08.440 --> 14:10.910
I'm not gonna let 'em get away
with what they did to me.

14:10.910 --> 14:13.480
Only my brothers wasn't
the ones who done it.

14:16.080 --> 14:18.520
You'd be making
a big mistake, girl.

14:21.490 --> 14:22.860
You'll be making a big mistake

14:22.860 --> 14:24.460
if you don't
shut your mouth, bud.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.830
You the Ranger that beat up
my younger brother, Royce?

14:30.530 --> 14:31.830
That's right.

14:31.830 --> 14:35.130
Oh, you're a real big man
with that badge on.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.240
You should see me
without one.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.810
( others chuckling )

14:38.810 --> 14:41.710
( laughing )

14:41.710 --> 14:44.710
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

14:47.880 --> 14:51.150
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

14:54.520 --> 14:56.090
MAN:
Shut up
and sit down!

15:03.060 --> 15:04.060
Okay, Farkas,

15:05.670 --> 15:06.700
why did they
do this to you?

15:06.700 --> 15:07.700
Ow!

15:07.700 --> 15:09.570
I already told you.

15:09.570 --> 15:11.640
What reason would I have
to lie about it?

15:11.640 --> 15:13.110
Well, take your pick.

15:13.110 --> 15:15.110
These were found with
two guys named Cochran

15:15.110 --> 15:16.280
in your Hummer.

15:16.280 --> 15:17.740
Mine?

15:17.750 --> 15:18.880
( laughs )

15:18.880 --> 15:20.010
As far as I know,
my Hummer

15:20.010 --> 15:21.450
was in the garage
all night long.

15:21.450 --> 15:23.150
Well,
it's in the impound now.

15:23.150 --> 15:25.620
It was involved
in a federal crime,

15:25.620 --> 15:28.090
so it's gonna stay there,
permanently.

15:28.090 --> 15:31.490
Why? Huh? These guys
must've ripped it off, okay?

15:31.490 --> 15:32.760
These guns,
they belong to them,

15:32.760 --> 15:34.430
because I've never
touched them in my life.

15:34.430 --> 15:36.630
Is that a fact?

15:36.630 --> 15:38.930
Then why are your prints
all over 'em?

15:38.930 --> 15:39.970
Hm?

15:41.140 --> 15:42.570
( knocking at door )

15:46.410 --> 15:47.570
TRIVETTE:
Got a match.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.380
The armory heist,
right?

15:49.380 --> 15:50.810
Federal task force
Alex is on

15:50.810 --> 15:52.380
has been working
this case for months,

15:52.380 --> 15:55.550
so I guess she'll stop going
gray when we solve it for her.

15:59.590 --> 16:01.850
These automatic weapons
are on this inventory

16:01.860 --> 16:03.590
of stolen military
ordnance, Mr. Farkas.

16:06.390 --> 16:08.860
Well, we're listening.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.170
( upbeat country music playing
over speaker )

16:13.170 --> 16:14.830
( bar patrons
laughing and chattering )

16:16.540 --> 16:17.840
Give me a pitcher,

16:17.840 --> 16:20.110
a vodka rocks and microwave
this for me, will ya?

16:26.250 --> 16:27.680
( high-pitched squealing )

16:27.680 --> 16:28.780
MAN:
Ah!

16:28.780 --> 16:30.450
MAN:
Do something!

16:32.020 --> 16:33.320
( Royce laughing )

16:33.320 --> 16:34.850
( laughing )

16:34.860 --> 16:38.090
So I says, "Five grand
don't buy jack."

16:38.090 --> 16:40.030
He says, "Take it
or leave it."

16:40.030 --> 16:42.160
So Pee Wee here
takes his face

16:42.160 --> 16:44.130
and starts paving
the parking lot with it.

16:44.130 --> 16:45.230
( men laughing )
Shut up!

16:45.230 --> 16:46.300
Shut up!

16:48.240 --> 16:50.200
You messed up.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.900
You brought Rangers
down on us.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.070
Rangers.

16:53.070 --> 16:54.840
Pee Wee too.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.910
The Farkas deal was yours.

16:56.910 --> 16:59.480
Instead of mouthin' off,
you ought to be out there

16:59.480 --> 17:02.280
rustlin' up another buyer,
real quick.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.950
And if you don't, you're gonna
end up as dog meat.

17:10.390 --> 17:11.460
C'mon, Troy.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.460
Don't mess up again.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.770
I'm on my way out.

17:26.770 --> 17:28.170
I'm gotta meet Stonham
for lunch.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.740
Lunch.

17:29.740 --> 17:31.210
It's business, Trivette.

17:31.210 --> 17:32.510
Well, so is this.

17:32.510 --> 17:36.250
These are automatic weapons
from the armory heist.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.950
Farkas claims that
these are samples

17:37.950 --> 17:39.750
from the Cochran''
sales kit.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.020
Nice work.

17:42.020 --> 17:43.520
So we figured we'd set up
the Cochrans,

17:43.520 --> 17:44.990
bust 'em and make it stick.

17:44.990 --> 17:46.290
So who's going undercover?

17:46.290 --> 17:48.130
I mean, they'd make
either of you in a second.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.460
Yeah, she's right.

17:49.460 --> 17:50.800
How 'bout Cobalt?

17:50.800 --> 17:52.300
SHREDDER:
How 'bout me?

17:52.300 --> 17:53.670
Look, you do know

17:53.670 --> 17:55.800
that I was the fellow
who once sold the Reunion Tower

17:55.800 --> 17:57.900
to three different buyers
on the same day, don't you?

17:57.910 --> 17:59.140
No.
No.

17:59.140 --> 18:01.110
Too flashy.
Cochrans are filth.

18:01.110 --> 18:02.140
It's the wrong mix.

18:02.140 --> 18:03.140
But that's exactly what

18:03.140 --> 18:04.740
would make them go for the fake.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.380
In my day, I have duped men

18:06.380 --> 18:07.880
far more ruthless
than the Cochrans,

18:07.880 --> 18:09.050
and I lived to tell the tale.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.720
Okay, Shredder.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.020
What's the catch?

18:12.020 --> 18:14.490
Now, I-- I take exception
to that, Walker.

18:14.490 --> 18:15.960
I-- I really do.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.090
I want him wired.

18:22.100 --> 18:23.960
One glitch
and we bail him out.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.770
Agreed?

18:26.700 --> 18:27.700
Ha!

18:30.800 --> 18:32.000
Let me have your jacket.

18:32.010 --> 18:33.710
She's, um, ahem--

18:33.710 --> 18:35.840
She's quite wonderful,
isn't she?

18:35.840 --> 18:37.340
Best prosecutor
I ever worked with.

18:37.350 --> 18:39.350
Oh really, Walker,
I was referring to her warmth,

18:39.350 --> 18:41.880
her sophistication,
her electrifying sexuality.

18:41.880 --> 18:44.220
I don't mix
business with pleasure.

18:44.220 --> 18:46.490
Quite frankly,
I think Alex

18:46.490 --> 18:47.750
would rather
fancy it if you did.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.360
I'm not a fancy type of guy.

18:50.360 --> 18:53.830
No, you're more the sort of
strong, silent type.

18:53.830 --> 18:54.990
How's our stock doing?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.530
Quite, uh,
predictably.

18:56.530 --> 18:58.130
It's undergone
a mild correction

18:58.130 --> 19:00.900
due to profit-taking
and, uh, should fairly soon

19:00.900 --> 19:03.070
resume its steady
climb up, up, up.

19:03.070 --> 19:04.570
How much profit
did we take?

19:05.570 --> 19:08.110
Profit?

19:08.110 --> 19:09.480
We made a profit?

19:09.480 --> 19:10.880
Am I gonna wear this?

19:10.880 --> 19:13.480
You do realize this is gonna
completely wreak havoc

19:13.480 --> 19:15.280
with the line of my jacket,
don't you? Hm?

19:27.630 --> 19:31.400
SHREDDER:
<i> Now, dear friends,</i>
<i> into the breach I go.</i>

19:45.710 --> 19:49.580
( upbeat rock music playing
over speaker )

19:49.580 --> 19:51.780
( bar patrons laughing,
chattering )

20:03.960 --> 20:05.300
Hi.
Hello.

20:05.300 --> 20:06.530
Can I get you something?

20:06.530 --> 20:07.900
Yes, thank you.
I'd, uh...

20:08.900 --> 20:11.500
I'd like a draft
and, um...

20:11.510 --> 20:15.980
an introduction to some chaps
called Cochran.

20:15.980 --> 20:17.640
Well, they're not here
right now,

20:17.650 --> 20:19.910
but they might blow in.

20:19.910 --> 20:21.110
How lovely.

20:21.120 --> 20:23.750
When they do,
could you possibly see to it

20:23.750 --> 20:26.090
that they sort of blow
in this direction?

20:26.090 --> 20:27.420
Brew's on me.

20:27.420 --> 20:28.550
Oh, you are nice.

20:28.560 --> 20:29.920
If I'd known that,
I'd have ordered

20:29.920 --> 20:31.290
a bowl of your chili as well.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.430
You got it, slick.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.160
( whispers ):
Slick?

20:36.160 --> 20:38.360
He doesn't seem
like the chili type.

20:38.370 --> 20:39.830
He's a con man,
Trivette.

20:39.830 --> 20:41.130
He can be anything
he wants to be:

20:42.370 --> 20:45.940
A chili lover,
a gunrunner,

20:45.940 --> 20:47.770
or an expert
in the stock market.

20:47.780 --> 20:50.480
Alex invested too.

20:50.480 --> 20:51.480
How is our stock doing?

20:51.480 --> 20:53.110
Will you give me a break,
Walker?

20:53.110 --> 20:55.680
I'm doing this for your own--
( engines roaring )

20:55.680 --> 20:59.080
( hooting and hollering )

20:59.090 --> 21:00.090
Come on!

21:03.360 --> 21:04.920
All right!

21:04.930 --> 21:05.960
Whoo-hoo!

21:10.000 --> 21:11.660
( rock music playing
over speaker )

21:19.240 --> 21:20.270
( grunts )

21:24.650 --> 21:26.650
I hear you're
lookin' for us.

21:26.650 --> 21:28.950
Well, if your name is Cochran,
sir, yes, I rather think I am.

21:28.950 --> 21:30.350
Take your pick.

21:30.350 --> 21:31.820
Hm?

21:35.320 --> 21:36.320
Now, who the hell are you?

21:36.320 --> 21:37.860
Me? Oh, um...

21:37.860 --> 21:40.390
Well, I'm just somebody
who's heard

21:40.400 --> 21:42.260
that you could
help me acquire a, um,

21:42.260 --> 21:44.100
certain capability.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.000
And what might that be?

21:46.000 --> 21:48.230
Superior firepower.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.670
It's rather important
in my trade.

21:49.670 --> 21:51.940
Of course, if I've
been misinformed, then I'll--

21:51.940 --> 21:54.540
( growls )
Ow.

21:54.540 --> 21:55.780
You talk weird.

21:55.780 --> 21:57.980
But your info is prime.

21:57.980 --> 21:59.280
Now, what's your game?

21:59.280 --> 22:01.610
Yes. Ahem, before
we go any further,

22:01.620 --> 22:03.280
I couldn't help noticing
in the newspapers

22:03.280 --> 22:05.380
that some of your brethren

22:05.390 --> 22:07.750
have been charged,
with, uh,

22:07.760 --> 22:09.220
having their way
with a young lady

22:09.220 --> 22:10.360
against her will.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.830
Oh, you mean that rape thing.

22:12.830 --> 22:15.730
Well, I'm concerned it might
complicate matters.

22:15.730 --> 22:17.300
Well, I wouldn't
worry about that,

22:17.300 --> 22:18.830
'cause she ain't gonna
live to testify.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.170
Now, are we doin' business,
or what?

22:23.170 --> 22:25.170
Yeah.

22:25.170 --> 22:26.200
Did we get
all that on tape?

22:26.210 --> 22:28.840
Loud and clear.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.780
Now, remember, we're talkin'
a whole truckload or no deal.

22:32.780 --> 22:33.780
Fair enough.

22:33.780 --> 22:35.250
Pending my examination
of the goods

22:35.250 --> 22:37.650
and an agreement
on an equitable price.

22:37.650 --> 22:40.490
Shall we say 10,000
in good faith?

22:42.790 --> 22:44.520
( chuckles )

22:44.530 --> 22:46.460
All right.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.560
Now...

22:47.560 --> 22:50.200
the rest is between
you and my brother.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.360
<i> If Troy says it's all right,</i>
<i> we'll set up a meetin'.</i>

22:55.070 --> 22:56.970
( loud squealing )

22:56.970 --> 22:58.100
MAN:
Come on, man!

22:58.110 --> 22:59.840
( patrons shouting )

22:59.840 --> 23:01.170
( radio feedback )

23:02.340 --> 23:03.510
What the hell is that?

23:04.250 --> 23:06.180
Huh? Uh...

23:06.180 --> 23:07.410
He's wired.
It's a setup.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.480
He's been made.

23:10.080 --> 23:11.450
You're dead.

23:11.450 --> 23:12.550
ROYCE:
No, wait.

23:12.550 --> 23:13.690
He's our ticket outta here.

23:13.690 --> 23:14.820
Let's go, boys.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.790
(<i> suspenseful theme playing</i> )

23:18.790 --> 23:20.290
ROYCE: Come on, move! Move!
Watch it!

23:20.290 --> 23:22.630
ROYCE: Let's go, boys!
( gunshots )

23:22.630 --> 23:24.560
Cops!

23:26.400 --> 23:27.770
Get down!
Get down!

23:29.770 --> 23:31.100
( grunting )

23:52.760 --> 23:53.930
( siren wails )

23:55.100 --> 23:56.960
SHREDDER:
Five hundred at 20 and a half.

23:56.960 --> 23:58.160
There you are.
Simple as that.

23:58.170 --> 24:00.170
WOMAN: Double in a month?
SHREDDER: Mm-hm.

24:00.170 --> 24:02.170
Look, if there's anything
I can do--

24:02.170 --> 24:03.940
Well, um,
arranging for the chef

24:03.940 --> 24:05.740
to send up
a crusty beef Wellington

24:05.740 --> 24:07.670
and a vintage Bordeaux
would more than suffice.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.670
( giggles )

24:12.380 --> 24:14.410
Hello, counselor. You look
like you've seen a ghost.

24:14.420 --> 24:17.980
They said you had been shot.
In the back, at close range.

24:17.990 --> 24:20.290
Twice. Ah, Walker,
you do realize

24:20.290 --> 24:22.150
I'll never be able to wear
that jacket again?

24:22.160 --> 24:23.790
I had to force him to wear

24:23.790 --> 24:25.190
this bulletproof vest.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.960
SHREDDER:
Walker was quite right
to insist.

24:26.960 --> 24:29.030
Actually, it wasn't
as bad as all that.

24:29.030 --> 24:30.300
Apart from a few cracked ribs,

24:30.300 --> 24:31.860
and a very nasty bruise,

24:31.870 --> 24:33.300
I'll be out of here
in no time.

42:06.420 --> 42:08.350
That's exactly
where I want 'em.

WALKER:
Hey. Drop it,
or you're dead.

42:43.820 --> 42:44.860
Ah!

42:46.060 --> 42:47.890
They never listen.

43:05.880 --> 43:06.880
Ah!

43:08.080 --> 43:09.580
Ah! Ah!

43:11.050 --> 43:12.120
Oh.

43:14.390 --> 43:15.390
Hey!

43:16.560 --> 43:19.960
( grunts and groans )

43:19.960 --> 43:21.730
Oh!

43:21.730 --> 43:23.330

43:23.330 --> 43:25.630
Ugh!

TRIVETTE:
They're all yours, C.D.

43:58.260 --> 44:01.130
No, no, no.
Like hell they are, Jimmy.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.930
Texas livestock law requires

44:02.940 --> 44:05.440
that we run them
through the sheep dip.

What?

Are you ki--?

44:18.550 --> 44:19.680
You told--

44:19.690 --> 44:23.190
You told me
it was a sure thing.

44:24.090 --> 44:26.090
No, not at this time.

44:26.090 --> 44:28.260
As a matter of fact, never.

44:28.260 --> 44:29.260
I--

44:29.260 --> 44:30.460
( slams phone down )

44:33.100 --> 44:34.530
Oh, man.

44:34.530 --> 44:37.770
The mutual fund went bust.

44:37.770 --> 44:39.140
Hmm.

44:39.140 --> 44:40.370
What am I going
to tell Walker?

44:40.370 --> 44:41.640
( clears throat )

44:41.640 --> 44:43.110
WALKER:
About what?

44:45.110 --> 44:46.940
Tell me.

44:51.880 --> 44:53.550
Stonham called.

44:55.390 --> 44:56.920
We lost all our money.

44:56.920 --> 44:58.790
You lost all my money?

44:58.790 --> 45:00.860
Yeah, he said something
about the fund manager

45:00.860 --> 45:06.330
declared chapter seven, 11,
or one of those crazy numbers.

45:06.330 --> 45:07.730
You lost all my money.

45:07.730 --> 45:09.200
I'm gonna pay it
all back, Walker.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.870
With interest.
With interest.

45:10.870 --> 45:12.200
This could be
the best investment

45:12.210 --> 45:15.540
of your life, Cordell.
You bet it could. Jimmy,

45:15.540 --> 45:17.610
heck, you might
win the lottery.

45:17.610 --> 45:21.080
Hi, guys.

45:21.080 --> 45:23.980
So, did you hear about,
uh, the stocks?

45:27.190 --> 45:28.450
It skyrocketed.

45:29.820 --> 45:31.160
Skyrocketed?

45:31.160 --> 45:34.290
Yeah. Up 15 points.

45:34.290 --> 45:37.060
Well, then why did Stonham
say that it crashed?

45:37.060 --> 45:40.470
I'll just bet you somebody
put him up to doing that.

45:40.470 --> 45:43.070
I can't imagine anyone
doing something that terrible.

45:43.070 --> 45:44.540
Nor can I.

45:44.540 --> 45:47.640
I mean to say,
that is utterly despicable.

45:47.640 --> 45:48.640
And, uh...

45:48.640 --> 45:50.310
( chuckles )

45:50.310 --> 45:51.740
totally unconscionable.

45:51.750 --> 45:53.080

45:53.080 --> 45:55.750
Why, you no...

45:55.750 --> 45:59.220
Ab-absolutely abominable.
