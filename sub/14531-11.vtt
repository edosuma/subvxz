WEBVTT

00:49.054 --> 00:49.973
- [screams]
- [yells]

00:50.055 --> 00:53.267
- Holy mother of Jesus in a tank!
- Oh, man.

00:53.350 --> 00:55.770
God. Sorry. I'm sorry.

00:55.853 --> 00:57.396
Oh, don't do that!

00:57.480 --> 01:00.232
Put some taps on your feet
so I can hear you coming.

01:00.316 --> 01:03.820
Well, you saw me last night. I'm
kinda surprised you're surprised.

01:03.903 --> 01:08.825
It's still shocking to find you
standing here in the cold light of day.

01:08.908 --> 01:10.701
Every day.

01:10.785 --> 01:14.038
Every... single... day.

01:14.121 --> 01:16.123
I'm here a lot, huh?

01:16.206 --> 01:19.794
Sure, have a deviled egg. Somebody
in my class can do without.

01:21.587 --> 01:24.214
I'm sorry.
I tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:24.298 --> 01:28.177
I'm gonna stop by Maudie's and
get you a dozen mini quiches,

01:28.260 --> 01:32.682
- 'cause I know you're a vegetarian.
- Thank you. I appreciate that.

01:34.892 --> 01:39.063
Oh, no! Where's my cantaloupe I
cut up for my class last night?

01:39.146 --> 01:41.065
Don't look at me.

01:41.148 --> 01:43.317
Oh, wait. You might wanna look at me.

01:44.986 --> 01:46.863
Might be my Ambien eating.

01:46.946 --> 01:48.739
Isn't it supposed to
be Ambien sleeping?

01:48.823 --> 01:51.283
No, it's great, I
sleep... I also Ambien eat.

01:51.367 --> 01:53.911
I also order shoes online.

01:53.995 --> 01:57.373
I got these on Ambien.
Four times.

01:59.416 --> 02:02.211
- I'll pick you up at seven for sushi.
- See you then.

02:02.294 --> 02:05.923
And I'll get you those mini
quiches and a cantaloupe.

02:08.717 --> 02:11.387
I'm gonna have to put a lock
on the refrigerator door.

02:11.470 --> 02:14.682
Why? He's only here at
night. And in the morning.

02:14.765 --> 02:16.433
Sometimes in the afternoon.

02:16.517 --> 02:19.687
Yeah, his grazing hours.
He's like a water buffalo.

02:19.770 --> 02:23.066
I just never know when
he's gonna pop up somewhere.

02:23.148 --> 02:27.028
And sometimes I like to
walk around without a bra.

02:27.111 --> 02:30.447
Or shirt. Or pants.

02:30.531 --> 02:33.283
Don't you think you're going
too fast with this guy, Guy?

02:33.367 --> 02:35.369
Are you ever gonna get
tired of that joke?

02:35.452 --> 02:37.121
No, no.

02:37.204 --> 02:40.833
You know, at my age, I only
have one speed. Break-neck.

02:40.917 --> 02:44.294
Of course, I don't call it that.
Because it is a very real fear.

02:44.378 --> 02:48.424
But you're going away with him.
You just signed the divorce papers.

02:48.507 --> 02:50.718
Before jumping in with both feet,

02:50.801 --> 02:56.223
don't you wanna find out if this is
just a rebound with this guy, Guy?

02:56.306 --> 02:58.434
- I am getting tired of it.
- You know, maybe it started off

02:58.517 --> 03:02.772
as a rebound thing, but...
what's wrong with him?

03:02.855 --> 03:04.690
No, I mean, tell me,
what's wrong with him?

03:04.774 --> 03:07.443
Well, we know he Ambien eats,
what else are we gonna find out?

03:07.526 --> 03:12.489
He ate his friend. I mean, we do know
a fair bit about the darker side of Guy.

03:12.573 --> 03:15.325
- How much worse can it get?
- TouchÃ©.

03:15.409 --> 03:20.205
And you know what else? It doesn't
matter. I am so lucky to have somebody.

03:20.289 --> 03:22.207
Do you know what most women
our age are dealing with

03:22.291 --> 03:24.168
besides sagging breasts
and chin hairs?

03:24.251 --> 03:28.756
Men who date younger women because they
don't have sagging breasts and chin hairs.

03:28.839 --> 03:31.717
- Are you trying to tell me something?
- Yes.

03:31.801 --> 03:33.970
That I have somebody that
doesn't care about that stuff.

03:34.053 --> 03:37.723
He appreciates my
maturity and my wisdom.

03:37.807 --> 03:40.059
Well, fine. Do what you want.

03:40.143 --> 03:43.604
But your boyfriend owes
me $900 in cheese.

03:45.689 --> 03:47.399
I feel dirty.

03:47.483 --> 03:50.569
Look, Jeff and Peter are letting
us taste their appetizers.

03:50.653 --> 03:52.822
That's all. No one's
making any commitments.

03:52.905 --> 03:54.782
But we should tell Diane
that we're tasting

03:54.865 --> 03:57.576
other people's appetizers
for our wedding.

03:57.660 --> 03:58.828
Caterers talk.

03:58.911 --> 04:02.289
We're just tasting!
It's all above board.

04:02.372 --> 04:04.416
But be honest.
It's a slippery slope.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.919
If we like what we taste,
we'll make promises.

04:07.003 --> 04:09.505
And then we'll sneak
around behind Diane's back

04:09.588 --> 04:11.632
until we find the courage
to tell her it's over.

04:11.715 --> 04:15.219
It'll be the last 20 years all
over again! With crab cakes!

04:15.302 --> 04:17.221
[doorbell rings]

04:17.303 --> 04:18.889
Sol, I'm answering the door.

04:20.141 --> 04:23.769
And if we love Jeff and Peter's
appetizers more than Diane's,

04:23.853 --> 04:26.981
- then I will call her myself.
- Yes, you will.

04:27.064 --> 04:30.567
- But do you think she'll still like us?
- No, but we have enough friends.

04:35.948 --> 04:39.326
I have fond memories of this doorway.

04:39.409 --> 04:42.579
Ohh. [stammers]

04:42.663 --> 04:46.083
Oh. Well, just so you know, I, uh...

04:46.167 --> 04:49.879
I... I... I met a man actually.

04:49.962 --> 04:53.465
He's-he's a boyfriend. My boyfriend.

04:53.549 --> 04:56.552
You know, we had that talk,
and-and... you know, it's very...

04:56.635 --> 04:58.804
we're-we're-we're
committed.

04:58.888 --> 05:03.267
I'm happy for you. I just
came down to say goodbye.

05:03.350 --> 05:05.186
- Oh, you're...
- Leaving.

05:07.021 --> 05:10.733
I'll be keeping a low profile.
Very low. Won't be reachable.

05:10.816 --> 05:14.278
- Where you going?
- A bit south.

05:14.361 --> 05:17.907
Of San Diego? That's... Mexico.

05:21.368 --> 05:25.206
I'm happy that a man appreciates
you. You should be savored.

05:47.270 --> 05:49.313
- Whoa.
- [door shuts]

05:49.396 --> 05:52.399
- Christ in a cab!
- Oh, God! You didn't see anything.

05:52.482 --> 05:57.280
Oh, really? It's my hearing that
sucks. My vision is just fine.

05:57.362 --> 06:00.616
- Don't look at me!
- That is my student, Grace!

06:00.699 --> 06:03.452
- It was nothing.
- It's completely inappropriate,

06:03.535 --> 06:05.370
practically sexual harassment.

06:05.454 --> 06:07.957
What are you talking
about? He's a grown man.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.709
Are there others? Did you go
after Tito? How about Homer?

06:10.793 --> 06:12.128
It's my job to protect them!

06:12.211 --> 06:14.755
It was just a little... goodbye kiss.

06:14.838 --> 06:17.883
Goodbye? When was hello?

06:19.093 --> 06:20.928
It was the day of the earthquake.

06:21.011 --> 06:24.848
- What is happening in this house?
- I don't know.

06:24.932 --> 06:27.977
Your boyfriend, who you're
practically marrying, just left here.

06:28.060 --> 06:29.770
First of all, nobody's
getting married,

06:29.853 --> 06:32.982
and second of all, I didn't
kiss Byron, he kissed me.

06:33.065 --> 06:37.569
- What about the first time?
- That one I might have participated in.

06:37.653 --> 06:40.948
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Honestly?

06:41.991 --> 06:43.326
It never occurred to me.

06:43.408 --> 06:47.163
I mean, I didn't think we were friends
that told each other things like that.

06:47.246 --> 06:48.998
Oh, you didn't.

06:49.081 --> 06:52.168
Well, no, not at the time.

06:52.251 --> 06:53.585
Why, did you?

06:54.753 --> 06:57.506
Not really.

06:57.589 --> 07:00.259
What about now? Are we
friends like that yet?

07:00.343 --> 07:05.097
- Are we?
- I don't know.

07:05.181 --> 07:09.810
But I'll... I'll make some tea and
you're gonna tell me everything.

07:11.145 --> 07:14.106
I haven't told a living
soul about this.

07:14.190 --> 07:18.944
I'm so honored. Okay,
spill it, sister.

07:20.487 --> 07:24.783
I came home, God knows where you were,
and there was a man in the kitchen.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.244
- Byron.
- Yeah, he was sitting right there

07:27.328 --> 07:30.080
- eating a ham sandwich.
- Oh, he loves ham.

07:30.164 --> 07:32.291
I have to admit, he is a looker.

07:32.375 --> 07:37.421
I would not want to sexualize a
student, but you're welcome to, go ahead.

07:37.504 --> 07:40.924
His eyes are really intoxicating.

07:41.008 --> 07:43.886
- Newman-esque, am I right?
- A young Robert Shaw.

07:43.969 --> 07:45.846
- Oh, yes! That's it.
- Yeah?

07:45.929 --> 07:49.308
"The trouble with the shark
is he's got lifeless eyes.

07:49.392 --> 07:52.519
Black eyes like a doll's eyes."

07:52.602 --> 07:55.272
[in a raspy voice] "You
got city hands, Mr. Hooper."

07:55.356 --> 07:58.817
[chuckles] Not so much.
Just tell me the story.

07:58.901 --> 08:02.821
It was daytime, and I
had picked up the mail...

08:02.905 --> 08:05.115
[teapot whistles]

08:06.533 --> 08:08.369
Hi, what are you doing?

08:08.452 --> 08:12.748
Oh, my God, Frankie, it's crazy
here. There's food everywhere.

08:12.831 --> 08:17.169
Jeff carved strawberries that
look just like roses. Uncanny.

08:17.253 --> 08:19.880
Okay, but you're not the only
one that's got stuff going on.

08:19.963 --> 08:22.883
There's stuff happening
here, too. Big stuff.

08:22.966 --> 08:25.428
What stuff?

08:25.510 --> 08:28.347
I'm just saying that
major stuff is happening.

08:28.431 --> 08:29.556
Like what?

08:29.639 --> 08:32.393
If you'd seen it your eyes
would have caught on fire.

08:32.476 --> 08:35.229
Grace kissed a convict.

08:35.312 --> 08:37.356
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

08:37.440 --> 08:40.692
Grace's face was smooshed
up against Byron's face.

08:40.775 --> 08:43.695
- Their lips were attached.
- The murderer?

08:43.779 --> 08:45.530
No, no, grand theft auto.

08:45.614 --> 08:47.491
You know, with the eyes.

08:47.574 --> 08:50.286
Oh. Yeah. Well, I can understand that.

08:50.369 --> 08:54.081
- I know, right?
- Isn't Grace still dating Guy?

08:54.164 --> 08:56.500
Yes, that's what makes it even crazier.

08:56.583 --> 08:58.835
Guy left to get me some
of those little quiches,

08:58.919 --> 09:00.879
next thing I know, Grace is kissing Byron.

09:00.963 --> 09:04.508
Grace! Our Grace!

09:04.591 --> 09:06.676
Yes, and apparently it
was not the first time.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.345
I mean, she's insatiable!

09:09.763 --> 09:12.224
It's the best little
whorehouse in Texas over here.

09:12.308 --> 09:14.518
That's totally insane.

09:14.601 --> 09:17.396
Frankie, I have to go.
We're plating the food.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.441
Okay. Fine.

09:20.524 --> 09:22.276
[sighs]

09:25.446 --> 09:27.406
I plate things, too.

09:27.490 --> 09:30.909
[inhales deeply] IncreÃ­ble!

09:30.993 --> 09:33.829
Grace kissed one of
Frankie's convicts today.

09:33.912 --> 09:36.206
- My Grace?
- That's what I said.

09:36.290 --> 09:40.210
- And apparently it wasn't the first time.
- How the hell did that happen?

09:40.294 --> 09:43.713
- Well, you should see the convict.
- Really?

09:43.797 --> 09:47.050
He's the siren. And she's not single.

09:47.134 --> 09:50.220
Good for her. She deserves some fun.

09:50.304 --> 09:53.723
Wait a minute. She's
dating your friend Guy.

09:53.807 --> 09:56.268
- They're not married.
- But they're together.

09:56.352 --> 09:59.229
And she's just kissing anyone
who wanders into the house?

09:59.313 --> 10:02.274
But we don't know the circumstances,
do we, so who are we to judge?

10:02.358 --> 10:05.486
Is that what you think? You
think there's a gray area?

10:05.569 --> 10:07.696
We never kissed anyone but each other.

10:11.033 --> 10:12.034
Did we?

10:15.037 --> 10:17.998
[background music playing]

10:22.586 --> 10:25.797
Do what must be done, just get them.

10:25.881 --> 10:28.050
Exclamation point.

10:31.887 --> 10:33.430
- Hey, Bri.
- Hey, Bri.

10:34.848 --> 10:37.226
No. No. No.

10:37.309 --> 10:39.686
Guys, please go away. Really?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.188
- You with anyone?
- No.

10:41.271 --> 10:42.523
- Wanna sit with us?
- No.

10:42.606 --> 10:44.525
- Why not?
- Because I'm with someone!

10:44.608 --> 10:48.404
- Ooh, what's this guy's problem?
- Please, please go away.

10:48.487 --> 10:51.532
Wait, wait, wait. The
last one was Racist Dave.

10:51.615 --> 10:53.617
- I loved Racist Dave.
- Feeling was mutual.

10:53.700 --> 10:56.995
And before him was Ambiguous
Andrew, and Micropenis Paul.

10:57.079 --> 10:59.164
- Yeah, it's a war out here.
- So, what's this guy's deal?

10:59.248 --> 11:01.041
- Does he smell like a cat?
- Does he have a cat?

11:01.124 --> 11:02.834
- Is he a cat?
- Yes, he's a cat,

11:02.918 --> 11:04.878
and his name is go to a
different fucking movie.

11:04.961 --> 11:06.380
It's not gonna fucking happen.

11:06.463 --> 11:08.882
Well, I won.

11:10.509 --> 11:11.843
Minor casualties.

11:17.641 --> 11:20.603
- Mmm.
- Do we know them?

11:20.685 --> 11:22.729
I'm afraid that we do.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.147
Do you do magic?

11:24.231 --> 11:27.443
- And you are...
- Coyote.

11:29.027 --> 11:32.322
Nwabudike. Can you spell
that? Do you wanna try?

11:32.406 --> 11:33.698
I've known them my whole life.

11:33.782 --> 11:35.951
It's their father who's marrying my father.

11:36.785 --> 11:38.537
Did I not tell you about that?

11:38.621 --> 11:42.625
It's totally fine, I'm
not damaged... by that.

11:42.707 --> 11:46.462
The mussel fritters caused
a riot at our last event.

11:46.545 --> 11:49.214
- Not a riot, Jeff.
- A stampede.

11:49.298 --> 11:51.258
Fair enough.

11:51.341 --> 11:54.511
There's a riot going on
in my mouth right now.

11:54.595 --> 11:57.431
That's the aioli. Hot pepper and lime.

11:57.514 --> 12:00.016
You kissed someone, is
that what you're telling me?

12:00.100 --> 12:03.520
Sol, you must try one of the potato nests.

12:05.689 --> 12:08.442
- Let's get more wine.
- Why? There's plenty here.

12:08.525 --> 12:11.403
Do you want to have an uncomfortable
conversation right here?

12:11.487 --> 12:15.449
We need more wine. Please excuse us.

12:20.412 --> 12:21.955
Have you ever been married?

12:22.038 --> 12:23.748
- No.
- Why not?

12:23.832 --> 12:26.001
- Well...
- You're tall.

12:26.084 --> 12:28.920
Do you have a thyroid problem?
Family history of pituitary issues?

12:29.004 --> 12:31.047
- Nope.
- You think you're better than me?

12:31.131 --> 12:33.800
It's "than I?" Maybe a little.

12:33.883 --> 12:36.136
I am taller than you.
And I have better grammar.

12:36.219 --> 12:38.180
- Where you from?
- Des Moines?

12:38.263 --> 12:40.432
Okay, I have no opinions on Des Moines.

12:40.516 --> 12:42.851
- Parents divorced?
- Not currently.

12:42.934 --> 12:43.935
Where do you work?

12:48.398 --> 12:49.483
He actually works for me.

12:49.566 --> 12:51.276
- There it is!
- That's the problem!

12:51.360 --> 12:53.111
Look, I know, before you say anything else,

12:53.195 --> 12:55.947
I'm just gonna go out
on a limb here and say...

12:56.031 --> 12:57.533
I'm really crazy about her.

12:59.242 --> 13:01.119
Do either of you guys
have a problem with that?

13:02.245 --> 13:04.707
I don't have a problem with that.

13:04.789 --> 13:07.376
Well. Well, well.

13:07.459 --> 13:10.045
Tall-Pants McGrammar-Glasses
put us in our place, didn't he?

13:10.128 --> 13:12.756
Yeah. Just gonna go back to my real seat.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.719
Pleasure meeting you,
Inevitable Lawsuit Barry.

13:16.801 --> 13:17.802
You, too.

13:17.886 --> 13:20.305
- You kissed somebody?
- It doesn't matter.

13:20.389 --> 13:21.515
Was it more than a kiss?

13:21.598 --> 13:23.392
[sighs]

13:24.017 --> 13:26.729
Oh, God, it was more than a kiss!

13:26.811 --> 13:29.314
It was twelve years ago,
and we were broken up!

13:29.398 --> 13:30.857
You still should have told me!

13:30.940 --> 13:34.069
- Sol, please, let it go.
- That's not how it works.

13:34.152 --> 13:36.405
It would be over by
now if you told me then,

13:36.488 --> 13:40.283
but you didn't, so letting
it go might take a while.

13:40.367 --> 13:43.995
So, when should I have told you? When
it happened and we weren't speaking?

13:44.079 --> 13:46.289
Or when we got back together
and things were good again?

13:46.373 --> 13:47.708
I don't know!

13:47.791 --> 13:51.086
Okay, okay, fine, you're
right. You're absolutely right.

13:51.169 --> 13:53.589
I should have told you
at the appropriate time,

13:53.672 --> 13:56.341
in the appropriate way, but this isn't it!

13:56.425 --> 13:59.553
- [phone ringing]
- [sighs]

14:01.096 --> 14:04.307
Can we just please get
through this evening, Sol?

14:04.391 --> 14:06.893
The guys made all that food just for us.

14:06.976 --> 14:09.187
Well, I can't eat now.

14:11.231 --> 14:12.441
Sol...

14:16.820 --> 14:18.822
Oy. Hello?

14:18.905 --> 14:20.741
Do you have the hard shell Tumi over there?

14:20.824 --> 14:22.867
- The what?
- My suitcase.

14:22.951 --> 14:24.828
I don't know, Grace, I'll have to look.

14:24.911 --> 14:28.206
Okay...? What's going on, Robert?

14:28.290 --> 14:30.584
- Nothing.
- What's wrong?

14:30.667 --> 14:33.336
I know that voice. What happened?

14:33.420 --> 14:34.546
Oh, for Christ's sake, Grace,

14:34.630 --> 14:37.257
there's a shitstorm over here,
all because you kissed a convict.

14:37.340 --> 14:39.259
What? Who told you that?

14:39.342 --> 14:42.929
Sol did, after Frankie told
him. And now I'm paying for it.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.307
I gotta go, kid. He's beside himself!

14:45.390 --> 14:46.891
[scoffs]

14:51.020 --> 14:52.731
[narrator speaking on television]

14:54.316 --> 14:58.528
- Uh-oh. - You told
Sol I kissed Byron!

14:58.612 --> 15:01.824
- I didn't know it was a secret.
- Of course you did!

15:03.617 --> 15:05.994
I have poor impulse control.
It's always been a problem.

15:06.077 --> 15:08.330
- Oh, please.
- It's true.

15:08.413 --> 15:09.998
I was once a shoo-in to win

15:10.081 --> 15:12.709
the giant produce contest
at the fair in Del Mar.

15:12.793 --> 15:15.920
But I caved and ate the zucchini
in the car on the way over.

15:16.004 --> 15:19.424
It's a condition, like
irritable bowel syndrome.

15:19.508 --> 15:22.469
I don't wanna hear about your problems!

15:22.552 --> 15:25.681
- I'm a private person, you know that.
- Yes.

15:25.764 --> 15:30.310
- You deliberately violated me.
- I'm sorry, I really am.

15:30.393 --> 15:34.022
I specifically said that I
had not told a living soul.

15:34.105 --> 15:36.941
You begged me to tell you.

15:37.025 --> 15:39.319
And for half a minute I
thought you were my friend.

15:39.402 --> 15:41.864
I am your friend, I'm your
friend with a big mouth.

15:41.946 --> 15:44.449
Well, I don't want a
friend with a big mouth.

15:44.533 --> 15:47.828
I want a friend I can
trust. Counts you out.

15:47.911 --> 15:50.747
Oh, please, don't count me out.

15:50.831 --> 15:55.001
I only told Sol, and it's not
like telling a real person.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.252
He's like my sister.

15:56.336 --> 16:00.799
Oh, he is the worst person
you could tell! He told Robert.

16:00.883 --> 16:03.426
But isn't it a little bit
exciting that Robert knows?

16:03.510 --> 16:05.637
They think they're having
all the fun over there.

16:05.721 --> 16:08.264
They need to know that some
stuff happens here, too.

16:08.348 --> 16:09.766
No, they don't!

16:09.850 --> 16:12.561
Oh, come on, you were dying to tell me.

16:12.644 --> 16:15.063
By the way, did you know
that secrets are bad for you?

16:15.146 --> 16:18.608
They can give you fibroids.
Or is that grief-eating?

16:18.692 --> 16:22.237
- Either way, they are extremely toxic.
- Being your friend is toxic!

16:22.320 --> 16:24.740
Okay, you're right. I screwed up.

16:24.823 --> 16:26.783
You deserve to be angry.

16:26.867 --> 16:29.494
But the only person I told was Sol!

16:29.578 --> 16:31.246
You don't speak to anyone else!

16:31.329 --> 16:33.916
It's not like I blabbed to Guy and
told him that you were over there

16:33.998 --> 16:37.043
kissing ex-convicts at
4:00 in the afternoon.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.045
[Guy] You did what?

16:40.547 --> 16:42.173
Hi, Guy!

16:42.257 --> 16:43.884
What did you do this afternoon?

16:45.802 --> 16:49.305
I told you there was too
much coming and going.

16:49.389 --> 16:50.974
You should've made him wear a bell.

16:56.563 --> 16:58.982
These crab cakes should be illegal!

16:59.065 --> 17:02.778
- [Peter] Crab clusters!
- Just tell me who it was.

17:05.488 --> 17:08.241
Was it someone I know?

17:08.324 --> 17:10.242
I don't know everyone you know.

17:10.326 --> 17:11.954
That's not answering my question!

17:12.036 --> 17:15.624
Tiger prawn twisters, y'all.
Comin' up in t-minus one minute.

17:15.707 --> 17:17.666
I don't know which is
worse, that you did it,

17:17.751 --> 17:18.961
or that you didn't tell me!

17:19.042 --> 17:22.964
- I really wish I hadn't done either.
- Correction, 30 seconds!

17:23.047 --> 17:26.675
We know five gay people in the world
and two of them are in the kitchen.

17:31.765 --> 17:35.310
My God in heaven, not Peter.

17:35.393 --> 17:39.689
- You slept with Peter!
- Worse. Jeff.

17:39.773 --> 17:44.110
- Jeff!
- Yes?

17:44.193 --> 17:48.197
So, you're telling me that
you kissed a convict at 4?

17:48.281 --> 17:49.908
I left at 3:50.

17:49.992 --> 17:52.368
It could have been ten after.

17:52.452 --> 17:55.371
- Well, what the hell happened?
- I didn't kiss him, he kissed me.

17:57.165 --> 18:00.418
So now you're telling me that
a convict forced himself on you?

18:00.502 --> 18:05.131
Yes. Well, no, I wouldn't
say forced, but forceful.

18:05.214 --> 18:07.425
Let me handle this.

18:07.509 --> 18:12.055
I teach art to society's
outcasts. It's meaningful work.

18:12.138 --> 18:15.350
- I derive much joy from it.
- Oh, Frankie.

18:15.433 --> 18:19.479
Sometimes these outcasts society's
forgotten end up in the kitchen,

18:19.562 --> 18:22.816
and this one just happened
to kiss Grace. It's no biggie.

18:22.899 --> 18:24.567
Everybody should go about their business.

18:24.651 --> 18:27.153
- Yeah.
- Are those my teeny quiches?

18:27.236 --> 18:28.864
It didn't mean anything, Guy.

18:28.947 --> 18:31.157
It's not something that's
ever gonna happen again.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.745
All right. Well, I gotta tell you, I
just don't feel like sushi right now.

18:38.456 --> 18:39.374
[door closes]

18:39.457 --> 18:40.583
Are you happy now?

18:41.626 --> 18:44.754
- No, I'm not happy. Don't say that.
- It's what you wanted, isn't it?

18:44.838 --> 18:47.507
No, it isn't what I wanted.

18:47.590 --> 18:49.592
He'll be back.

18:53.429 --> 18:54.848
I mean it, Jeff.

18:54.931 --> 18:56.391
Take your fritters and go.

18:56.474 --> 18:59.352
Actually, leave the fritters, and
the crab cake clusters, please.

18:59.435 --> 19:03.773
It was one night, Sol. And if it's any
consolation, we were not compatible.

19:03.857 --> 19:05.901
It's not any consolation at all.

19:05.984 --> 19:09.571
- My God, what's the point of being gay?
- I didn't know there was a point.

19:09.654 --> 19:13.533
Come on, if you can't shed the conventions
of a hetero life, where's the fun?

19:13.616 --> 19:17.662
I'm not gay in order to shed conventions,
I'm gay because I love this man!

19:17.746 --> 19:20.373
This one, the one you didn't
much enjoy sleeping with!

19:20.456 --> 19:23.376
- You can still love Robert.
- I still love Jeff.

19:24.377 --> 19:25.503
Is that how you feel?

19:29.507 --> 19:33.219
I feel it's time for Jeff and
Peter to go. I'm sorry, fellas.

19:33.302 --> 19:37.557
But obviously Sol and I have
some serious talking to do.

19:40.894 --> 19:42.854
- What about my wok?
- [Jeff] We'll get it later.

19:42.938 --> 19:46.149
That was maybe the most
violent movie I've ever seen.

19:46.232 --> 19:50.612
I know. Next time we should save the $30
and just smack each other in the face.

19:50.695 --> 19:53.489
Aw, so that means there's a next time?

19:55.158 --> 19:57.744
Hey, I'm sorry for my... Bud and Coyote.

19:57.827 --> 20:01.205
Oh, no, no. It's cool. You're really lucky.

20:01.289 --> 20:02.415
Am I?

20:02.498 --> 20:06.544
Yeah. Those guys are like brothers.
They were looking out for you.

20:06.628 --> 20:09.505
Yeah, I guess they can be sort of sweet.

20:15.678 --> 20:17.597
- Asswipes!
- Some Milk Duds...

20:17.680 --> 20:19.891
- Oh, shit, she's taking the heels off!
- For my milk buds!

20:19.975 --> 20:20.976
Go, go, go!

20:24.437 --> 20:25.772
I'll just...

20:27.065 --> 20:28.942
I'll just be here.

20:32.195 --> 20:35.865
- Hi.
- How are you doing? I'm so sorry.

20:35.949 --> 20:39.368
No, I'm sorry. I walked out. I
just needed some time to think.

20:39.452 --> 20:40.870
That's understandable.

20:40.954 --> 20:42.705
It's not your fault. I
mean, the guy kissed you.

20:42.789 --> 20:45.125
I'm sorry it happened. It
will never happen again.

20:45.208 --> 20:49.253
He's on the lam now. But
that's neither here nor there.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.258
You know, so I had to
wander around out there

20:54.342 --> 20:58.346
and... try to figure out why
this is bothering me so much.

20:58.429 --> 21:03.351
- It didn't mean anything.
- Well, no, it meant something to me.

21:03.434 --> 21:08.982
And I came to realize that... I
don't want anyone else kissing you.

21:09.065 --> 21:12.694
Oh, my goodness. So sincere.

21:15.363 --> 21:19.242
I've never been jealous.
I've never been possessive.

21:20.284 --> 21:24.288
And anytime anyone felt that way about
me, I was usually on the first plane,

21:24.372 --> 21:27.167
got the hell out of there.
That's not what I'm feeling here.

21:27.250 --> 21:31.213
Grace, you're... You're the
first thing that I think about

21:31.295 --> 21:33.548
when I wake up in the morning.

21:34.549 --> 21:37.510
And you're the last thing I think
about when I go to sleep at night.

21:37.593 --> 21:39.554
It makes sense.

21:39.637 --> 21:43.349
You just have to roll over on your
right side lately and there I am.

21:46.061 --> 21:47.520
I'm trying to tell you something here.

21:49.731 --> 21:51.649
I'm falling in love with you.

22:13.379 --> 22:15.965
You know what they say
about drinking alone?

22:16.049 --> 22:19.219
That there's twice as much to drink.

22:19.302 --> 22:21.512
It's valerian.

22:21.596 --> 22:23.806
Need something stronger?

22:23.890 --> 22:25.767
Just trying to quiet the head.

22:25.850 --> 22:27.393
Me, too.

22:38.404 --> 22:41.324
If I could undo it, believe me, I would.

22:41.407 --> 22:45.328
You and Jeff? Well, that's good to know.

22:45.411 --> 22:48.331
But that's not what's bothering me.

22:48.414 --> 22:51.167
Not what's bothering me
the most, at any rate.

22:51.251 --> 22:54.921
I'm here, talk to me. And try the noodles.

22:55.004 --> 22:57.506
All those things everyone said.

22:57.590 --> 23:03.387
"What's the point of being gay if
you're gonna live a conventional life?"

23:03.471 --> 23:05.974
I'm not the one that said 'em.

23:06.057 --> 23:08.768
And Jeff and Peter
certainly don't speak for me.

23:08.851 --> 23:11.520
But have you honestly thought about this?

23:11.604 --> 23:15.358
Did we really spend all those years
and fight our way out of one box

23:15.441 --> 23:17.401
just to climb into another?

23:17.485 --> 23:20.780
There are a lot of ways to be a couple.

23:20.863 --> 23:22.865
We just have to find the best way for us.

23:22.949 --> 23:25.868
You don't think we're doing this wrong?

23:25.952 --> 23:29.372
No, I don't think so.

23:29.455 --> 23:31.374
So...

23:31.457 --> 23:36.212
you're fine never
sleeping with anyone again,

23:36.296 --> 23:39.590
- or Jeff?
- Oh, God, yes.

23:40.883 --> 23:42.760
But you're not just doing this for me?

23:42.844 --> 23:45.347
I waited 20 years for you.

23:46.722 --> 23:49.642
I'd wait another 20 if I had to.

23:51.602 --> 23:54.438
There is no one else for me.

23:57.692 --> 24:00.987
You were the prize. I won.

24:09.078 --> 24:11.914
Oh, my God, why is this so good?

24:11.998 --> 24:13.958
It's criminal, right?

24:17.086 --> 24:19.922
We're going to hire
those idiots, aren't we?

24:22.425 --> 24:24.052
I'll call Diane.

24:41.319 --> 24:46.074
I know you're on a vocal fast from
me, and I wholeheartedly accept that,

24:46.157 --> 24:51.454
but I want to apologize sincerely
for telling Sol about you and Byron.

24:51.537 --> 24:53.456
Friends do not betray confidences.

24:53.539 --> 24:56.418
I know. It was not cool of me.

24:56.500 --> 24:59.503
But I'm happy Guy came back,
and I want to make it up to you.

24:59.587 --> 25:01.130
You're moving out?

25:01.214 --> 25:05.593
I owe you one of my most
embarrassing secrets.

25:06.635 --> 25:08.679
And you can tell whomever.

25:08.763 --> 25:09.972
What the hell is that?

25:10.056 --> 25:14.769
It's a sex tape from
the '80s. Of me and Sol.

25:14.852 --> 25:18.481
Do whatever you want with it.
Call Robert. Tell the kids.

25:18.564 --> 25:22.360
- Put it on the 6:00 news if you like.
- Can I burn it?

25:22.444 --> 25:26.489
Please do. Watching yourself have sex...

25:26.572 --> 25:29.742
is so much better in your
mind than it is on film.

25:29.825 --> 25:32.995
I appreciate the gesture.

25:33.079 --> 25:36.374
I cannot believe I'm asking
this and I dread the answer,

25:36.458 --> 25:39.335
but what on Earth
possessed you to make that?

25:39.419 --> 25:41.296
It was a crazy night.

25:41.379 --> 25:45.467
We'd just returned from Plato's retreat.
We still had our gladiator costumes on.

25:45.549 --> 25:47.343
- Oh, you're kidding.
- I wish I were.

25:47.427 --> 25:49.887
The sword belt and the
sandals and everything?

25:49.971 --> 25:53.266
And the shields. We had to
put those down at one point.

25:53.349 --> 25:56.227
But what can I say? The spirit moved us.

25:56.311 --> 25:59.814
- It was a say yes night.
- What's that?

25:59.897 --> 26:02.650
That's a night where you go out
and you say yes to everything.

26:02.733 --> 26:06.028
Except one thing, which I won't do.

26:06.112 --> 26:09.491
- Where can we get a VCR?
- Oh, I'm not watching it again.

26:09.573 --> 26:13.119
Oh, yes you are. It's no fun if
you're not watching it with me.

26:13.202 --> 26:17.706
How about I give you another secret and
50 bucks, and we don't watch the tape?

26:17.790 --> 26:21.127
Okay. But I get to decide
if the secret's good enough.

26:21.210 --> 26:25.173
Okay. I once made out with a monkey.

26:25.256 --> 26:27.300
You did not.

26:27.383 --> 26:29.177
One of the Monkees, Micky Dolenz.

26:29.260 --> 26:31.804
Oh, no! He's the worst one.

26:31.887 --> 26:34.807
- Not with his tongue.
- Oh, God!
