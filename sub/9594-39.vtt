WEBVTT

00:20.588 --> 00:23.391
Titans! On the other side
of this door

00:23.424 --> 00:26.360
lies a world of adventure,
intrigue

00:26.394 --> 00:28.529
and danger.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.832
Don't you ever get tired
of being excited
about everything?

00:31.865 --> 00:33.801
Yes I do!

00:33.834 --> 00:35.836
-That's why I'm in therapy,
to lower my blood pressure.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.539
But this time,
I have reason to be excited.

00:38.572 --> 00:41.142
Because I am about to show you

00:41.175 --> 00:44.345
something truly beyond
your imagination.

00:45.613 --> 00:48.516
Ooh! Imagination!

00:48.549 --> 00:53.554
And don't you ever
get tired of saying "Ooh!"
to everything Robin says?

00:53.587 --> 00:54.722
Yes I do!

00:54.755 --> 00:57.558
I am only trying to be
the polite.

00:57.591 --> 00:59.260
Now, as I was saying...

00:59.293 --> 01:01.329
Just open the door, Robin.

01:01.362 --> 01:02.230
Fine.

01:02.263 --> 01:04.765
Behold, the wonders of...

01:04.798 --> 01:06.334
Imagination!

01:12.173 --> 01:13.707
It's just an empty room.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.576
Until we fill it!

01:15.609 --> 01:18.246
Yeah, that's how rooms work.
They're empty
until you fill them.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.449
But we're going
to fill it with imagination!

01:21.482 --> 01:22.350
Ooh!

01:22.383 --> 01:24.752
We are standing
in a state-of-the-art

01:24.785 --> 01:26.320
virtual reality room

01:26.354 --> 01:29.657
that can simulate
any environment imaginable.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.859
Okay! That is cool!

01:31.892 --> 01:33.894
For training purposes!

01:33.927 --> 01:35.696
ALL: Ugh!

01:35.729 --> 01:37.465
Training?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.433
Don't you ever
get tired of making
cool things boring?

01:39.467 --> 01:41.535
Yes I do! And I'm in therapy
for that as well!

01:41.569 --> 01:43.704
Now watch,
as cutting edge technology

01:43.737 --> 01:45.706
transforms this empty room

01:45.739 --> 01:47.608
into a world of...

01:47.641 --> 01:50.344
-Imagination.
-Imagination.

02:03.691 --> 02:06.360
Uh, I thought you said
this was cutting-edge.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.662
Yeah, these graphics
are terrible.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.864
They're not terrible.

02:10.898 --> 02:13.801
Wait. Are you sure this is
a virtual reality machine

02:13.834 --> 02:15.603
and not some
souped

02:15.636 --> 02:17.738
Does this look like
a video game?

02:17.771 --> 02:18.772
-Sure does.
-Mm-hmm.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.840
-Indeed.
-Yes.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.542
Well, it's not! Now...

02:21.575 --> 02:23.844
I've set up different
simulated missions

02:23.877 --> 02:25.913
to test each
of you individually.

02:25.946 --> 02:27.948
Now, Titans, are you ready

02:27.981 --> 02:30.818
to experience a world of...

02:30.851 --> 02:32.520
Imagination!

02:32.886 --> 02:34.755
Ooh!

02:34.788 --> 02:36.690
Imagination!

02:36.724 --> 02:38.959
Love that patronizing
attitude, Star!

02:38.992 --> 02:40.428
You're up first!

02:43.431 --> 02:45.433
Ooh, this battle simulation

02:45.466 --> 02:48.702
looks like the beginning
of a great quest of legends.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.880
OLD MAN: Take this.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.237
Yes, yes, of course.
Don't mind this old man.

03:23.271 --> 03:24.638
You're young,
you have things to do.

03:24.672 --> 03:26.574
I'll just be here,
sad and alone

03:26.607 --> 03:28.242
with a wooden sword
that no one wants.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.344
STARFIRE: I suppose
you could come with me.

03:30.378 --> 03:31.979
OLD MAN:
You mean, leave the cave?

03:32.012 --> 03:33.647
STARFIRE: Yes! Yes!

03:33.681 --> 03:36.617
Join me in the
quest of the legends,
sad old man!

03:36.650 --> 03:40.321
OLD MAN:
Hot dog! I'll bring the sword!

03:40.354 --> 03:42.756
STARFIRE:
A wooden sword is useless,

03:42.790 --> 03:44.492
but wonderful!

03:47.895 --> 03:49.563
OLD MAN: Be careful, hero.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.865
These are dangerous creatures.

03:51.899 --> 03:52.900
I'll handle this.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.335
Ouch!

03:54.368 --> 03:55.603
That smarts!

03:55.636 --> 03:58.739
Protect me from this
vicious beast, hero!

03:58.772 --> 04:01.675
STARFIRE: This beast
is not vicious, sad old man.

04:01.709 --> 04:04.578
He merely desires
the scratchy-scratchies.

04:04.612 --> 04:07.047
Scratchy-scratchy
scratchy-scratch!

04:07.080 --> 04:09.450
All the livvy-long
days and months.

04:09.983 --> 04:12.286
Adorable!

04:23.331 --> 04:24.632
STARFIRE: Land squid,

04:24.665 --> 04:26.500
will you join us
on our quest of the legend?

04:26.534 --> 04:28.569
-Joy!

04:32.940 --> 04:36.043
DISTRESSED WOMAN:
Hero, help!
My Coocalacka has escaped!

04:36.076 --> 04:37.511
STARFIRE:
You mean, the chicken?

04:37.545 --> 04:38.779
DISTRESSED WOMAN: No!

04:38.812 --> 04:40.448
Coocalacka!

04:40.481 --> 04:41.949
OLD MAN: I'll handle this.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.584
Ha-uh!

04:43.617 --> 04:45.686
Ow! Oh, my eye!

04:45.719 --> 04:46.887
Oh, the pecking! Ah!

04:46.920 --> 04:49.990
DISTRESSED WOMAN:
Please, hero!
Catch my Coocalacka

04:50.023 --> 04:52.560
and I'll reward you
with this empty bottle.

04:53.427 --> 04:56.063
That is the useless reward.

04:56.096 --> 04:58.799
Scratchy-scratchy
scratchy-scratch!

04:58.832 --> 05:01.535
All the livvy-long
days and months.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.417
You are gathering an army!

05:16.450 --> 05:19.487
You are truly
the hero of legend!

05:19.520 --> 05:21.955
You will
slay the villain for sure!

05:21.989 --> 05:23.023
Slay?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.125
Oh, but I just wish to dance!

05:25.158 --> 05:26.827
Works for me!

05:45.112 --> 05:47.581
BEAST BOY:
Cross the street? Come on!

05:47.615 --> 05:50.117
Why doesn't anyone think
I can do anything hard?

05:50.150 --> 05:51.719
Ugh. Whatever.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.588
I'll just transform into
a little froggy-frog, and...

05:54.622 --> 05:56.657
Ah!

05:57.658 --> 05:59.893
Okay, that guy totally
came out of nowhere!

05:59.927 --> 06:02.596
Ah!

06:03.664 --> 06:04.732
Ow!

06:04.765 --> 06:06.066
Ow! Ow!

06:06.099 --> 06:07.635
Ow! Ow!

06:07.668 --> 06:09.136
Why won't anyone
stop for a frog?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.704
Ow! Come on!

06:11.939 --> 06:13.674
Who taught you how to drive?

06:15.108 --> 06:16.777
-Ah! A snake!

06:18.178 --> 06:19.847
What's a snake
doing on the highway?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.550
How am I supposed
to cross this stupid road?

06:22.583 --> 06:25.819
Oh! I just need
to use the crosswalk. Easy!

06:26.787 --> 06:28.489
-Aah!

06:28.522 --> 06:30.891
I had the right of way,
you fool!

06:30.924 --> 06:32.493
Ugh!

06:32.526 --> 06:36.163
I don't understand how this
is supposed to teach anyone
how to cross the road!

06:36.830 --> 06:38.432
Cross the road?

06:38.466 --> 06:39.833
Ah-ha! That's it!

06:39.867 --> 06:41.669
This is a job for a chicken!

06:41.702 --> 06:43.837
Yeah! I'm doing it!

06:43.871 --> 06:46.173
I'm doing it!
Yeah! Ha-ha! Whoo!

06:46.206 --> 06:49.009
Can't hit me! Ha-ha!
Whoo-hoo! Yeah!

06:49.042 --> 06:50.143
Almost there!

06:50.177 --> 06:51.612
Ah! Gator!

06:51.645 --> 06:52.713
Ah!

06:56.984 --> 06:59.553
RAVEN: Look at us!
We're dressed nice!

07:00.554 --> 07:02.155
Hey. Who's that circle guy?

07:02.189 --> 07:04.024
Why is he eating our balls?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.726
We have to stop him! Go!

07:07.260 --> 07:08.729
Guys gonna help or what?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.764
Seriously, look at you guys.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.933
No wonder circle guy
just takes all your stuff.

07:12.966 --> 07:15.936
Look, now he's eating
your cherries. Come on!

07:15.969 --> 07:17.204
Now, let's focus.

07:17.237 --> 07:19.473
Move in formation
on my command.

07:19.507 --> 07:20.841
Go! Go! Go!

07:26.146 --> 07:27.581
I don't know what he ate,

07:27.615 --> 07:28.916
but it's making him nuts!

07:28.949 --> 07:30.851
Pull back! Pull back!
Pull back!

07:32.886 --> 07:34.522
No!

07:35.188 --> 07:37.825
I'll never forget you, Stinky.

07:37.858 --> 07:39.827
Let's end this.

07:43.764 --> 07:44.965
No!

07:44.998 --> 07:46.834
Ah!

07:48.001 --> 07:49.002
Ugh.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.807
CYBORG: Ooh! Pie hunter!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.244
Pie in four miles.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.880
Rev it up, baby! Vroom-vroom!

07:59.913 --> 08:02.215
And, check the mirrors,
seat belt on,

08:02.249 --> 08:04.885
turn signal, and merging.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.088
Hey! Ah!

08:08.121 --> 08:09.723
Slow down, you maniacs!

08:09.757 --> 08:12.125
I am going
the posted speed limit!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.127
-Just go around me!

08:14.161 --> 08:16.630
Go around me!

08:16.664 --> 08:19.733
Why is everybody
in such a rush nowadays?

08:19.767 --> 08:22.870
Driving is a privilege,
not a right! Gosh!

08:22.903 --> 08:25.706
Oh, look at
Tailgate Johnny back there.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.908
You like my bumper stickers
or what?

08:28.709 --> 08:29.910
Hey!

08:30.911 --> 08:32.913
CYBORG: Great!
Just what I need today.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.315
SPY VILLAIN:
Now, you are
going to pay!

08:35.348 --> 08:37.317
CYBORG: What?
You're gonna pay, buddy.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.587
No way that accident
was my fault.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.021
You better have insurance.

08:41.054 --> 08:42.990
SPY VILLAIN: Can't we
handle this without insurance?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.326
I cannot have another accident
on my record.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.728
Well, you should have
thought of that

08:47.761 --> 08:49.029
before you decided
to drive so recklessly.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.800
Come on now, I will pay
for the repairs in cash.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.101
Huh

08:54.134 --> 08:55.636
Uh-uh! No-kay.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.270
Fine.

09:00.774 --> 09:04.044
Ooh, look at that! Pie!
I love pie!

09:04.077 --> 09:06.313
-Ah!

09:06.346 --> 09:09.717
SPY VILLAIN:
Mess up my driving record,
I mess up your face!

09:09.750 --> 09:11.952
Oh, my goodness!

09:11.985 --> 09:15.055
This is so scary!
I just wanted to get some pie!

09:15.088 --> 09:17.758
Get away!
You are a careless motorist!

09:17.791 --> 09:20.861
-No pie for you!
I make you die now!

09:20.894 --> 09:23.196
-Pothole!

09:23.230 --> 09:25.198
-Whoa!
-Oh!

09:25.232 --> 09:28.168
That's what you get
for being a careless motorist.

09:28.201 --> 09:29.603
Booyah!

09:29.637 --> 09:31.304
Just in time for pie!

09:31.972 --> 09:33.273
Finally!

09:33.306 --> 09:35.375
* When I say apple
you say pie

09:35.408 --> 09:37.344
* Apple pie
apple pie

09:37.377 --> 09:38.812
* When I say...

09:38.846 --> 09:40.781
-SPY VILLAIN: Ah-ha!

09:40.814 --> 09:43.617
I bet you did not know
I had helicopter!

09:43.651 --> 09:45.085
Ah! My car!

09:45.118 --> 09:46.920
I kill your stupid pie!

09:46.954 --> 09:49.723
-No!
Okay, I go now.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.324
I hate you, Pie Hunter.

09:54.394 --> 09:55.929
I'm coming for you, Princess!

09:55.963 --> 09:56.864
Bug stomp!

09:56.897 --> 09:59.767
Uh, better stomp it again
to make sure.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.335
Bug stomp! Ha ha! Awesome!

10:02.369 --> 10:04.371
Bug stomp! Bug stomp!

10:04.404 --> 10:05.706
Aw.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.941
Now where was I?
Oh, right! The princess!

10:09.009 --> 10:11.979
Oh, bet there's
something good in there!

10:12.012 --> 10:13.346
Ow! Money!

10:13.380 --> 10:15.315
Ow! I'm rich! Ow!

10:15.348 --> 10:16.817
Oh, that's a concussion!

10:16.850 --> 10:18.285
But I'm rich! Whoo-hoo! Ow!

10:18.318 --> 10:20.020
Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:20.053 --> 10:22.222
Ooh... Who am I?

10:22.255 --> 10:24.324
Why am I here?

10:24.357 --> 10:26.226
Argh! No more distractions!

10:26.259 --> 10:29.162
The princess needs me!
I'm coming, princess!

10:30.030 --> 10:30.931
Huh.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.767
I wonder where this
large sewage pipe goes.

10:33.801 --> 10:37.104
No! Gotta save the princess!

10:37.137 --> 10:40.674
Ah, but there
could be something
really good in there!

10:40.708 --> 10:42.876
I can't resist! Ah ha ha!

10:42.910 --> 10:44.411
Whoo!

10:44.444 --> 10:47.047
-Aw, man. Ooh, that stinks.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.882
Urgh! Oh! Ooh!

10:48.916 --> 10:52.052
Why did I just go down
a sewage pipe? Oh!

10:52.085 --> 10:53.153
This is so gross.

10:53.186 --> 10:54.321
So much sewage...

10:54.354 --> 10:56.023
In this sewage pipe.
Can't breathe!
