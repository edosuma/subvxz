WEBVTT

01:07.708 --> 01:09.375
Isn't it strange?

01:09.458 --> 01:12.375
Tevinter is home
to the most powerful magic in the world.

01:12.875 --> 01:15.000
We're hated for it, envied for it,

01:15.916 --> 01:19.041
but all agree Tevinter Mages
can accomplish nearly anything,

01:19.625 --> 01:23.541
when the truth is we possess
only a fraction of the power we once held.

01:24.833 --> 01:28.041
-So many secrets locked away in our past.

01:28.125 --> 01:32.166
Ages ago, Magisters harnessed forces
we still don't fully understand.

01:33.458 --> 01:35.250
At least in this case,

01:35.958 --> 01:37.416
there may be a witness.

01:38.208 --> 01:41.500
You know, if you're so desperate
to dig through the past,

01:41.583 --> 01:44.833
you could get rid of the slave corpses
Marconius IV put in the walls.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.250
Mad bastard.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.833
Careful, Tassia,
you might offend the Chantry.

01:48.916 --> 01:51.000
-And you won't?

01:51.083 --> 01:54.875
Rezaren, you look like every bad rumor
about us combined.

01:54.958 --> 01:59.083
A Magister skulking around dark ruins,
summoning demons.

01:59.166 --> 02:01.708
Oh, you just need a skull
hanging from your belt.

02:01.791 --> 02:04.041
I'm summoning a spirit.
It's completely different.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.708
Spirits, demons, they're all dangerous.

02:09.500 --> 02:12.625
Getting a history lesson about that thing
isn't worth the risk.

02:14.125 --> 02:17.500
The Divine himself asked me
to research the Circulum Infinitus.

02:17.583 --> 02:19.958
After you practically begged him.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.833
Even if you got it to work,
you could never use it.

02:23.916 --> 02:27.166
It's powered by blood magic.
The Divine would never approve.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.666
And that's exactly why I'm doing this.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.166
The Circulum Infinitus was crafted here.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.791
If we can find a spirit
that witnessed its creation,

02:34.875 --> 02:38.500
we can learn how it was made
and how to modify it to our own needs.

02:39.708 --> 02:42.375
It is supposed to bring
the dead back to life, Tassia.

02:42.458 --> 02:43.958
Just as they were before.

02:44.041 --> 02:46.958
Maker's breath, don't you think
that's worth investigating?

02:49.916 --> 02:52.958
Isn't there someone
you'd give anything to get back?

02:56.625 --> 02:59.666
All right.
But we're in this together.

03:00.958 --> 03:03.750
I am not letting you
face one of those things alone.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.041
Welcome, Spirit of Wisdom.

03:24.833 --> 03:28.750
Rezaren Ammosine,
Magister of the Tevinter Imperium.

03:29.250 --> 03:31.125
I am called Memory,

03:31.708 --> 03:35.500
and I have observed all things
in this place since its founding,

03:35.583 --> 03:37.250
in service of Tevinter.

03:37.333 --> 03:40.041
Then perhaps you remember
the creation of this?

03:43.625 --> 03:44.666
The Circulum!

03:48.250 --> 03:51.708
The last and greatest work
of Magister Amelia Pavus.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.916
Yet, I sense it has never been used.

03:56.000 --> 03:56.833
No.

03:57.333 --> 04:00.166
It was lost
in the scuffle of politics and history.

04:00.750 --> 04:03.333
But you intend to use it now?

04:05.166 --> 04:06.000
I might,

04:06.500 --> 04:07.875
but times have changed.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.750
I will not kill one person
to resurrect another.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.625
I need a way to use the Circulum
without spilling blood.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.208
Be wary, Magister.

04:17.875 --> 04:21.625
Many before you have sought
to bring back the dead, and failed.

04:21.708 --> 04:25.666
By name and by nature,
mortals are doomed to die.

04:26.500 --> 04:30.000
And nothing goes against nature
without consequence.

04:30.083 --> 04:33.333
Just because something hasn't been done
doesn't mean it can't be done.

04:33.416 --> 04:35.208
And Magisters don't frighten easily.

04:35.291 --> 04:40.125
True, but you do not comprehend
the full danger of this artifact.

04:40.708 --> 04:43.875
Power like this draws many eyes.

04:44.541 --> 04:47.458
Should the Circulum
go to the one that seeks it,

04:47.541 --> 04:49.875
all of Tevinter will burn.

04:49.958 --> 04:52.375
Who else wants this artifact?

04:52.458 --> 04:55.333
Revealing that
would be unwise.

04:56.250 --> 04:58.541
We didn't ask what you thought, spirit.

04:58.625 --> 05:01.125
-Tell us who else wants the Circulum!

05:04.500 --> 05:08.041
You dare command me,
like some common shade?

05:08.125 --> 05:10.708
I summoned you, and you will answer!

05:12.125 --> 05:14.041
Beware, boy.

05:14.125 --> 05:18.041
Memory unheeded can only become enmity.

05:18.125 --> 05:19.750
Answer the question, spirit!

05:23.833 --> 05:25.583
Rezaren, careful. I think--

05:31.000 --> 05:32.458
I think it might transform.

05:32.541 --> 05:34.916
Great,
now we've got to deal with a demon.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.125
Spirit or demon,
it still can't cross the circle.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.833
Don't let them break through!

06:20.500 --> 06:21.500
Say nothing.

06:30.041 --> 06:34.000
Such power should never have been
in mortal hands,

06:34.083 --> 06:35.708
but in my own.

06:40.791 --> 06:42.750
You should have kept running, demon!

07:10.125 --> 07:12.291
Arrogant little meat sack!

07:12.958 --> 07:14.916
-Hey!

07:17.083 --> 07:18.125
No!

07:40.750 --> 07:44.583
If that artifact is a threat to Tevinter,
we need to destroy it.

07:45.125 --> 07:48.333
It's not the artifact that's dangerous.
It's whoever else wants it.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.708
I won't let anyone
take the Circulum from me.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.500
-Not even you--
-I won't risk losing you.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.458
What?

07:56.916 --> 07:58.958
I said I won't risk losing you.

07:59.458 --> 08:03.000
But I'm supposed to protect
everyone in this palace, Rezaren.

08:03.500 --> 08:05.958
Please don't make me
protect you from yourself.

08:06.458 --> 08:07.583
Don't worry,

08:07.666 --> 08:09.833
I can't be away
from Minrathous much longer.

08:11.083 --> 08:13.416
One way or another,
this will all be over soon.

08:16.708 --> 08:19.666
And that would be
the call to evening chant.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.708
We're not done talking about this though.

08:21.791 --> 08:24.583
Oh, of course not.
I have an extensive lecture planned.

08:25.708 --> 08:27.458
Just let me wrap things up here.

08:38.250 --> 08:40.291
The defenses in this place are insane.

08:40.791 --> 08:41.958
I swear, if we don't fix them,

08:42.041 --> 08:44.208
some poor bastard
is going to get everyone killed.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.833
I promised I'd change them, and I will.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.291
Until then, you'll have to accept

08:48.375 --> 08:50.625
that your job might not be
as boring as it usually is.

08:50.708 --> 08:55.416
My job's supposed to be boring.
Which reminds me, I'm on rotation tonight.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.458
So I get to do my favorite thing,

08:57.541 --> 09:00.625
standing outside doors,
carefully watching nothing.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.791
Well, it's still better
than singing the Chant of Light, again.

09:16.541 --> 09:18.541
Maker bless your evening,
Knight Commander.

09:19.166 --> 09:20.625
And yours, Magister.

09:39.541 --> 09:40.708
Second bell.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.875
That, my friends,
is the second of four bells

09:43.958 --> 09:45.708
in an Imperial Chantry service.

09:46.291 --> 09:49.166
Right now, most of the palace
is busy looking for salvation.

09:49.250 --> 09:51.916
Let's make sure we're on our way
before they find it.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.041
Understand?

09:56.875 --> 09:58.458
All right, one last time.

10:03.166 --> 10:05.291
<i>We split off into four teams.</i>

10:06.916 --> 10:09.125
<i>Roland, you're our man on the inside.</i>

10:19.375 --> 10:21.833
<i>Draw as many guards as you can</i>
<i>out of the throne room</i>

10:21.916 --> 10:23.958
<i>so Lacklon and I can access the vault.</i>

10:46.333 --> 10:49.000
-Oh! Oh!

10:49.083 --> 10:50.666
Help! Help!

10:50.750 --> 10:52.958
Oh, oh, the pain!

10:53.041 --> 10:54.791
Terrible! Oh!

10:55.291 --> 10:58.000
Please, someone tell my wife I loved her.

10:59.458 --> 11:02.625
<i> Lacklon will watch my back,</i>
<i>and I'll get us into the old temple vault.</i>

11:02.708 --> 11:04.291
-Huh?

11:10.666 --> 11:13.208
<i>Hira and Qwydion,</i>
<i>head for the cathedral.</i>

11:13.291 --> 11:15.583
<i>We need to keep those people inside</i>
<i>for as long as we can.</i>

11:33.666 --> 11:35.458
Blood and spite. Hang on!

11:37.000 --> 11:37.875
Ah!

11:49.166 --> 11:53.083
<i>Miriam, I won't ask you</i>
<i>to go any further into the palace,</i>

11:53.166 --> 11:55.041
<i>but we can't lose access to that tunnel.</i>

11:59.250 --> 12:00.833
<i>Guard it with your life.</i>

12:10.875 --> 12:13.208
Is… Is someone there?

12:14.166 --> 12:16.375
Please don't tell the cook, okay?
I'm-- I'm…

12:17.833 --> 12:18.833
I'm hiding too.

12:20.000 --> 12:21.666
<i>No, no, wait!</i>

12:27.416 --> 12:28.333
Oh.

12:31.708 --> 12:32.583
Ow!

12:33.666 --> 12:36.250
A slave should never harm her betters!

12:36.333 --> 12:38.416
No, no, wait, please don't!

12:38.500 --> 12:39.541
Ow!

12:45.750 --> 12:49.375
Uh, I don't know
the delicate way to bring this up,

12:49.458 --> 12:51.416
but I know you're loyal
to Magister Ammosine

12:51.500 --> 12:53.875
and that he thinks of you as family and…

12:55.791 --> 12:59.333
Well, he's under so much pressure
to figure out the Circulum.

12:59.416 --> 13:02.416
Neb, I worry he could be tempted
to do something dangerous.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.000
Or wrong.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.416
I know we aren't close,
and I swear by The Maker,

13:08.500 --> 13:09.875
I don't want to get you in trouble,

13:10.458 --> 13:14.000
but has he done anything off around you,
out of the ordinary?

13:14.083 --> 13:14.958
I just--

13:18.250 --> 13:21.583
-What's going on here? Trading gossip?

13:21.666 --> 13:26.166
Just fighting off boredom.
Are you leaving early, Magister?

13:26.750 --> 13:29.875
As much as I love hearing about
my failings in the eyes of The Maker,

13:30.375 --> 13:32.083
a walk might be a bit more pleasant.

13:32.166 --> 13:33.791
Allow me to escort you.

13:33.875 --> 13:35.000
Oh.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.000
Of course.

13:36.541 --> 13:37.666
That would be lovely.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.375
It's all right, Neb.
Meet me back at the apartments.

13:44.125 --> 13:46.541
Pfft. I mean, he's cute, but yikes.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.750
-Let's stay focused.

13:50.166 --> 13:51.208
Oh shit, the third bell.

13:52.083 --> 13:55.291
Boost me up, then head to Fairbanks.
I'll do the bottom seal on my own.

14:01.583 --> 14:03.458
-The cook.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.458
Why are you hiding from them?

14:07.291 --> 14:09.041
I took some food from the trash.

14:09.125 --> 14:11.041
I didn't think it would do any harm.

14:11.125 --> 14:13.916
-They weren't even gonna eat it.

14:20.541 --> 14:24.375
A slave owns nothing. Is nothing.

14:24.958 --> 14:27.791
You are not fit to touch what is mine.

14:27.875 --> 14:30.291
Please,
I don't want her to beat me.

14:30.375 --> 14:34.208
If I can just hide here for a bit,
maybe-- maybe she'll calm down.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.375
Don't be stupid. She won't.

14:37.083 --> 14:38.416
And hiding won't help you, so--

14:39.791 --> 14:42.916
Where's my bat-eared thief
of an apprentice?

14:48.416 --> 14:50.000
Want me to call an actual thief?

14:50.083 --> 14:52.791
We're past the third bell
and I ain't holding the circle thing.

14:53.375 --> 14:56.166
You know, my wife always says
sarcasm doesn't help,

14:56.250 --> 14:58.708
but I never
really understood that until now.

14:59.916 --> 15:01.958
The next patrol. They found Roland.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.208
Work faster, or we're all dead.

15:07.625 --> 15:11.833
I've told you, there's no one else here.
I think you should leave.

15:11.916 --> 15:15.083
I'll be damned
if I let an elf tell me what to do.

15:15.166 --> 15:17.458
I meant no disrespect, but…

15:18.166 --> 15:19.916
You think I'm scared of you?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.416
It don't matter
how special an elf you are.

15:22.500 --> 15:25.250
-You're still just a tool.

15:25.333 --> 15:28.375
An assassin must
know their role to perfection.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.458
You are the sword of this family.
You will not fail us.

15:32.541 --> 15:33.750
-Again!

15:33.833 --> 15:35.208
Again!

15:36.291 --> 15:41.125
You touch me and they'll string you up
by the ears, just like any other slave.

15:46.250 --> 15:47.583
Of course, ma'am.

15:48.208 --> 15:50.833
I believe I've found
what you're looking for.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.791
-No! No, no, please!
-Ah, come on, you little beggar.

15:55.875 --> 15:59.208
It's been a while
since I've boiled all the pots clean.

16:00.208 --> 16:02.625
Let's see how much heat
that delicate elven skin can take.

16:02.708 --> 16:04.625
-How could you?
-I'm sorry.

16:07.750 --> 16:09.708
No one ever saves people like us.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.291
You sky-sucking idiot!

16:15.375 --> 16:17.500
You were supposed to
get rid of the guards!

16:17.583 --> 16:19.750
-Not attract more of them!

16:20.333 --> 16:23.291
Well, thank goodness
you've come to my rescue.

16:42.291 --> 16:45.166
Oh, come on.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.375
Praise the Maker.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.291
You're just opening it now?

16:57.958 --> 16:59.875
Qwydion's already
on her way back to the tunnel.

16:59.958 --> 17:01.250
Good to see you too, Hira.

17:01.333 --> 17:05.458
Sorry we're running late, Hira.
No, please, you go first, Hira.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.583
-Interlocking barriers.

17:27.666 --> 17:30.750
-They look pretty lethal too.
-But you can disable them?

17:30.833 --> 17:33.208
-Please. That's why I'm here.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.083
See?

17:47.916 --> 17:51.500
You know, I was almost hoping
you wouldn't be able to do that.

17:54.250 --> 17:56.958
For what it's worth,
I wish there'd been another way.

18:11.833 --> 18:14.708
The service is almost over.
We should go back.

18:14.791 --> 18:17.416
-You go ahead, I'll just be--
-I know what you're doing, Rezaren.

18:18.583 --> 18:21.458
-What are you talking about?

18:26.375 --> 18:27.416
Miriam…

18:28.708 --> 18:30.208
What did you do?

18:32.958 --> 18:36.333
You're trying to wait me out
so you can go back to the vault again.

18:36.833 --> 18:37.916
I didn't…

18:38.500 --> 18:40.375
Is it really that obvious?

18:41.083 --> 18:43.750
That demon should have been
the end of things.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.291
If you won't listen to me,
maybe you'll listen to The Divine.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.416
You wouldn't.

18:47.958 --> 18:51.500
What you're trying to do is valiant,
but you're becoming obsessed.

18:53.416 --> 18:54.916
-You're right.
-What?

18:55.541 --> 18:59.458
I've wanted so much to rescue the dead
that I've lost sight of the living.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.708
Will you help me see clearly again?

19:25.958 --> 19:28.583
Fairbanks, stop! Listen to me!

19:34.791 --> 19:36.541
I think we're a little past that!

20:02.375 --> 20:03.916
Fairbanks!

20:06.875 --> 20:08.125
This can't be happening.

20:08.875 --> 20:09.708
I can't…

20:13.416 --> 20:14.916
Maker, forgive me.

20:55.041 --> 20:57.083
Ho-ho, well, that can't be good.

21:03.208 --> 21:06.041
-Head back to the rendezvous.

21:11.083 --> 21:13.583
-Those came from the vault.

21:14.625 --> 21:18.875
Rezaren, Divine Marconius
built that vault to be a last resort.

21:18.958 --> 21:21.250
Its security system
isn't meant to stop intruders.

21:21.333 --> 21:23.208
It's meant to stop a full-scale coup.

21:23.291 --> 21:25.625
It's designed to kill
everyone in the palace.

21:25.708 --> 21:26.875
Hira.

21:28.166 --> 21:30.375
Don't be an idiot, we have to go now.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.791
No. Wait!

21:37.791 --> 21:39.250
-Huh.

21:42.458 --> 21:43.291
Huh!

21:47.750 --> 21:48.875
Uh…

21:48.958 --> 21:50.500
Oh, okay.

21:54.833 --> 21:57.500
Uh, shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!

22:04.833 --> 22:07.416
-Move, move, move, move!

22:07.500 --> 22:09.125
-Get to your--

22:11.041 --> 22:12.375
It's fine.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.041
It'll be fine.

22:33.750 --> 22:34.625
Huh?

22:35.708 --> 22:38.208
Fairbanks?

22:38.291 --> 22:39.958
What happened? Where's Hira?

22:41.708 --> 22:43.041
It…

22:43.666 --> 22:44.500
I…

22:51.791 --> 22:53.291
What the fuck?
