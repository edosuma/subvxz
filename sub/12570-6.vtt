00:10.334 --> 00:11.751
Okay, Ravi, your turn!

00:12.250 --> 00:14.167
Here I go. Here I go!

00:14.667 --> 00:16.959
Anyone else want to go?

00:17.083 --> 00:18.167
Come on, Ravi, it's fun.

00:18.168 --> 00:19.250
Trust me.

00:19.292 --> 00:21.334
What are you afraid of?

00:21.375 --> 00:23.064
Rope, jumping,

00:23.065 --> 00:24.751
and any scenario where

00:21.375 --> 00:24.751
Luke tells me to trust him.

00:33.459 --> 00:35.251
Excuse me, I've been

00:35.252 --> 00:37.042
watching you guys

00:33.459 --> 00:37.042
for a while, and...

00:37.083 --> 00:38.459
Stranger danger!

00:38.460 --> 00:39.834
Stranger danger!

00:41.083 --> 00:42.375
Initiate scenario two!

00:42.417 --> 00:44.459
Stop, drop, and roll!

00:45.584 --> 00:46.980
That... That's scenario five,

00:46.981 --> 00:48.375
in case of a fire!

00:48.918 --> 00:50.000
Oh, my bad.

00:50.417 --> 00:51.896
Guys, relax!

00:51.897 --> 00:53.375
I'm Corinne Baxter,

00:53.417 --> 00:55.334
award-winning TV producer.

00:55.375 --> 00:57.042
- Ooh, you should meet
- our butler.

00:57.083 --> 00:58.397
He's an award-winning

00:58.398 --> 00:59.709
TV watcher.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.709
Ooh.

01:00.083 --> 01:01.583
I'm producing

01:01.584 --> 01:03.083
a new reality show about

01:00.083 --> 01:03.083
families with nannies...

01:03.125 --> 01:04.418
Oh, I... I'm a nanny,

01:04.419 --> 01:05.709
and this is my family!

01:05.751 --> 01:07.042
Smile everyone!

01:07.083 --> 01:08.918
JESSIE: Aren't they adorable?

01:09.083 --> 01:10.563
So, I assume you're

01:10.564 --> 01:12.042
interested in being on...

01:09.083 --> 01:12.042
Yes! (GASPS)

01:12.083 --> 01:13.501
I cannot believe

01:13.502 --> 01:14.918
I'm going to have

01:12.083 --> 01:14.918
my own TV series!

01:14.959 --> 01:16.210
I've got to go call

01:16.211 --> 01:17.459
everyone I know!

01:17.500 --> 01:18.751
Hey, Darla!

01:20.959 --> 01:22.147
Did your nanny just leave

01:22.148 --> 01:23.334
without you guys?

01:25.334 --> 01:26.813
You did not say

01:26.814 --> 01:28.292
it was a show

01:25.334 --> 01:28.292
about good nannies.

should be the party

02:28.418 --> 02:29.834
you're throwing me for my

02:27.000 --> 02:29.834
two year nanniversary!

02:29.876 --> 02:31.042
What's that?

02:31.083 --> 02:32.522
The anniversary

02:32.523 --> 02:33.959
of my becoming your nanny.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.250
Since when is that a thing?

02:35.251 --> 02:36.500
We didn't celebrate it

02:34.000 --> 02:36.500
last year.

02:36.792 --> 02:38.584
Exactly. And here is your

02:38.585 --> 02:40.375
chance to erase that pain.

02:42.083 --> 02:43.563
I think the first show

02:43.564 --> 02:45.042
should star me

02:42.083 --> 02:45.042
and my dance moves.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.000
- I'll be more popular
- with the ladies

02:47.042 --> 02:48.042
Than Ryan Gosling

02:48.043 --> 02:49.043
holding a puppy.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.000
ALL: Aw.

02:51.125 --> 02:52.375
See?

02:52.751 --> 02:54.042
Sorry, what?

02:54.083 --> 02:55.522
I was just picturing

02:55.523 --> 02:56.959
Ryan Gosling holding a puppy.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.834
It is adorable.

03:00.083 --> 03:02.042
- And I'm going to come up
- with a catchphrase,

03:02.083 --> 03:03.563
Then print it on everything

03:03.564 --> 03:05.042
from mugs to diapers.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.563
I'll get them drinking

03:06.564 --> 03:08.042
and stinking!

03:09.083 --> 03:11.522
As tasteful as a soiled diaper

03:11.523 --> 03:13.959
with "mmm-hmm" emblazoned

03:09.083 --> 03:13.959
upon it would be,

03:15.083 --> 03:16.334
doing this show

03:16.335 --> 03:17.584
would be a huge mistake.

03:17.876 --> 03:19.418
I give you two words.

03:19.419 --> 03:20.959
Heisenberg Principle.

03:21.083 --> 03:22.563
Can you give us two words

03:22.564 --> 03:24.042
we can understand?

03:24.083 --> 03:25.376
I am sure Jessie comprehends

03:25.377 --> 03:26.667
what I am saying.

03:27.667 --> 03:29.042
Of course I do.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.542
But, why don't you

03:30.543 --> 03:32.000
break it down?

03:29.083 --> 03:32.000
Just for the kids.

03:32.584 --> 03:34.542
- The Heisenberg Principle
- states that

03:34.584 --> 03:36.042
Once the camera is introduced,

03:36.083 --> 03:37.355
people cannot help,

03:37.356 --> 03:38.626
but change their behavior.

03:38.667 --> 03:40.355
Witness every dope who has

03:40.356 --> 03:42.042
ever been on a reality show.

03:42.083 --> 03:44.042
- Who cares?
- Those dopes are famous!

03:44.083 --> 03:46.042
- And momma wants
- a big slice of that.

03:50.125 --> 03:51.584
Bertram, it's 4:00.

03:51.585 --> 03:53.042
You're going to sleep already?

03:53.083 --> 03:55.167
No, I just woke up.

03:56.083 --> 03:57.542
You know, Mom and Dad

03:57.543 --> 03:59.000
will be watching

03:56.083 --> 03:59.000
this reality show.

03:59.042 --> 04:00.962
- Don't you want them to see
- how hard you work?

04:02.083 --> 04:03.459
(ALL LAUGHING)

04:06.834 --> 04:09.083
- Ah, seriously, though,
- I better clean this place up.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.563
I'm gonna go look for the

04:10.564 --> 04:12.000
vroom-vroomy thing.

04:17.083 --> 04:18.541
Ugh, this bug bite

04:18.543 --> 04:20.000
kept me up all night.

04:22.083 --> 04:23.751
What a pity.

04:23.792 --> 04:25.397
Are you ready

04:25.398 --> 04:27.000
for a lovely breakfast,

04:23.792 --> 04:27.000
and your close-up?

- Good morning!

04:30.626 --> 04:32.083

Don't you worry your messy

04:46.564 --> 04:48.000
little head about us.

04:48.042 --> 04:49.542
We're just here to capture

04:49.543 --> 04:51.042
who you really are.

04:51.083 --> 04:52.751
Oh, well!

04:52.792 --> 04:53.938
Who I really am

04:53.939 --> 04:55.083
is an actress.

04:56.918 --> 04:58.022
(DRAMATICALLY)

04:58.023 --> 04:59.125
No, no, no!

04:59.167 --> 05:01.042
This yogurt has...

05:01.083 --> 05:02.626
Expired!

05:04.042 --> 05:06.125
Alas, poor yogurt!

05:06.167 --> 05:08.000
I knew it well.

05:08.125 --> 05:09.125
(DRAMATIC SOBBING)

05:11.125 --> 05:13.083
- I don't know what's
- more ridiculous.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.063
Your acting, or the fact

05:15.064 --> 05:17.000
that you have a salad fork

05:13.125 --> 05:17.000
stuck in your hair.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.563
And now, for the most

05:22.564 --> 05:24.042
gratifying part of my day.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.522
When my beloved charges

05:25.523 --> 05:26.959
come home from school.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.480
Which reminds me

05:28.481 --> 05:29.959
of when I played Maria

05:27.000 --> 05:29.959
in The Sound of Music.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.680
- CORINNE: Please,
- don't start singing...

05:32.042 --> 05:33.209
again.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.626
The Fort Tavey Gazette

05:35.627 --> 05:37.167
said I was, and I quote,

05:37.209 --> 05:39.000
"Entirely adequate!"

05:41.959 --> 05:43.501
Uh, and now we are

05:43.502 --> 05:45.042
getting off the elevator

05:45.083 --> 05:46.459
after a long, hard day

05:46.460 --> 05:47.834
of learning.

05:47.876 --> 05:49.959
And now we are walking...

05:50.000 --> 05:52.042
Walking, walking...

05:52.083 --> 05:53.583
And you're driving us

05:53.584 --> 05:55.083
crazy, crazy, crazy!

05:57.834 --> 05:58.939
You don't have to narrate

05:58.940 --> 06:00.042
everything we do!

06:00.083 --> 06:01.724
- Especially, when I popped
- that pimple!

06:01.751 --> 06:03.481
Did you really have to

06:03.482 --> 06:05.209
make that "pssh" noise?

06:01.751 --> 06:05.209
(SNORTS LAUGHTER)

06:06.083 --> 06:08.083
That epidermal explosion

06:08.084 --> 06:10.083
needed no audio enhancement

06:06.083 --> 06:10.083
from me.

06:13.792 --> 06:15.501
This is my playhouse,

06:15.502 --> 06:17.209
and you're just living in it!

06:18.209 --> 06:19.709
Excuse me?

06:19.751 --> 06:21.125
It's my catchphrase.

06:21.167 --> 06:23.125
- Make sure to get it
- in the first episode,

06:23.167 --> 06:24.646
And I'll cut you in

06:24.647 --> 06:26.125
for 10% of the merch.

06:26.167 --> 06:27.918
Mmm, money!

06:30.083 --> 06:32.167
Found it! (CHUCKLES)

06:32.209 --> 06:34.188
Did you know

06:34.189 --> 06:36.167
there's a whole closet

06:32.209 --> 06:36.167
full of cleaning supplies?

06:37.125 --> 06:38.709
People, please!

06:38.751 --> 06:40.125
I need you to act naturally.

06:40.167 --> 06:41.375
Of course!

06:41.417 --> 06:43.042
Check this out!

06:43.083 --> 06:44.792
(GRUNTING)

06:47.417 --> 06:48.667
(GROANS)

06:49.667 --> 06:50.834
Now I know why they

06:50.835 --> 06:52.000
call it "hard wood."

06:53.083 --> 06:55.000
- Careful!
- You're in my shot.

06:57.792 --> 06:58.918
Now, I will make everyone

06:58.919 --> 07:00.042
yummy snacks.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.042
Much as my idol, Meryl Streep,

07:02.083 --> 07:04.000
- to whom I have been
- compared many times,

07:04.459 --> 07:05.751
Did when she played

07:05.752 --> 07:07.042
Julia Child.

07:07.083 --> 07:09.042
- Who compared you
- to Meryl Streep?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.000
Everyone!

07:12.209 --> 07:14.125
Come, lovable scamps.

07:17.918 --> 07:19.709
This is a disaster!

07:19.751 --> 07:20.897
If I can't spice this up,

07:20.898 --> 07:22.042
this show will be canceled

07:19.751 --> 07:22.042
before it even airs.

07:22.083 --> 07:24.042
And I cannot go back

07:24.043 --> 07:26.000
to producing monkey makeovers.

07:26.042 --> 07:28.063
I don't care how much

07:28.064 --> 07:30.083
eyeliner you put on them,

07:26.042 --> 07:30.083
they're just not pretty!

07:30.417 --> 07:31.896
Uh, hey, Corinne,

07:31.897 --> 07:33.375
you're missing some

07:30.417 --> 07:33.375
great stuff in here.

07:33.417 --> 07:34.814
I'm making lunch,

07:34.815 --> 07:36.209
while acting out Hamlet,

07:36.250 --> 07:38.125
with an actual ham!

07:40.334 --> 07:41.688
I told you, just do

07:41.689 --> 07:43.042
the things you normally do.

07:43.083 --> 07:44.542
Oh. This is.

07:44.584 --> 07:45.834
Last week I did

07:45.835 --> 07:47.083
Macbeth-aroni and cheese.

07:54.834 --> 07:56.418
I'm Zuri, and I have

07:56.419 --> 07:58.000
sass to spare!

07:59.250 --> 08:01.167
Please, no more catchphrases!

08:02.876 --> 08:04.584
So, I bet your sister Emma

08:04.585 --> 08:06.292
drives you crazy!

08:07.083 --> 08:08.792
- Huh?
- No.

08:08.834 --> 08:10.417
- But there's this girl
- at school,

08:10.459 --> 08:12.271
She's a combination

08:12.272 --> 08:14.083
of nasty and awful.

08:14.125 --> 08:16.000
She's nasty-ful.

08:17.083 --> 08:19.042
Ooh, a new catchphrase!

08:19.083 --> 08:20.251
I'm gonna go print that

08:20.252 --> 08:21.417
on a bunch of diapers.

17:10.835 --> 17:12.584
let us quit the show,

17:12.626 --> 17:14.146
- here's the plan...
- (ELEVATOR DINGS)

17:16.083 --> 17:17.584
Really?

17:18.709 --> 17:20.250
(ALL GROANING)

17:21.083 --> 17:22.209
Okay, we can't give Corinne

17:22.210 --> 17:23.334
anything to use against us,

17:23.375 --> 17:24.605
so from now on,

17:24.606 --> 17:25.834
we just have to be

17:23.375 --> 17:25.834
super nice to each other.

17:25.876 --> 17:27.791
I am nice!

17:27.834 --> 17:29.439
And if I hear one more

17:29.440 --> 17:31.042
snarky remark

17:27.834 --> 17:31.042
about my footwear,

17:31.083 --> 17:32.418
someone will get a

17:32.419 --> 17:33.751
bunion to the butt!

17:35.000 --> 17:36.125
Please. The last time

17:36.126 --> 17:37.250
you tried to step

17:35.000 --> 17:37.250
on a cockroach,

17:37.292 --> 17:38.501
it pushed you over

17:38.502 --> 17:39.709
and took your lunch money.

17:40.083 --> 17:42.292
(CHUCKLES) Ravi's weak.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.375
This is exactly

17:45.376 --> 17:46.376
what I'm talking about!

17:46.417 --> 17:48.250
- Look, if we want to
- get rid of Corinne,

17:48.292 --> 17:50.042
We have to be the nicest,

17:50.043 --> 17:51.792
most polite people

17:48.292 --> 17:51.792
on the face of the Earth.

17:52.417 --> 17:54.042
- Okay!
- (SCREAM)

17:54.083 --> 17:55.542
Get these out of my face,

17:55.543 --> 17:57.000
or your head is next!

18:03.083 --> 18:04.334
Okay, that was an example

18:04.335 --> 18:05.584
of what not to do.

18:10.042 --> 18:11.481
Jessie, your nanniversary

18:11.482 --> 18:12.918
dinner is served.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.230
I do hope that later

18:14.231 --> 18:15.375
you will regale us

18:15.417 --> 18:17.126
with one of your magnificent

18:17.127 --> 18:18.834
dating stories.

18:18.876 --> 18:20.792
They are always so riveting.

18:22.083 --> 18:24.042
Oh, Bertram, you flatter me.

18:24.083 --> 18:26.063
And might I say

18:26.064 --> 18:28.042
that you are a fine man,

18:24.083 --> 18:28.042
with a sunny disposition,

18:28.083 --> 18:29.626
and no weird hobbies at all.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.209
Dear sister, would you care

18:35.210 --> 18:37.042
for some more lemonade?

18:37.083 --> 18:39.000
- Thank you, Zuri.
- How kind of you.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.938
Allow me to serenade you all

18:43.939 --> 18:46.792
with bird calls

18:41.083 --> 18:46.792
to help aid digestion.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.334
I give you

18:48.959 --> 18:50.792
the haunting loon.

18:52.626 --> 18:54.334
(MIMICKING BIRD CRY)

18:59.542 --> 19:01.021
That is the worst loon call

19:01.022 --> 19:02.500
I ever heard.

19:02.542 --> 19:05.000
And I worked on Loon Dynasty.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.584
I see what you're doing.

19:07.626 --> 19:08.834
You're trying to ruin my show

19:08.835 --> 19:10.042
by acting all nice.

19:11.083 --> 19:13.059
- We're just being ourselves
- in front of the cameras,

19:13.083 --> 19:14.459
In full compliance

19:14.460 --> 19:15.834
with our contract.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.834
- And what's wrong
- with being nice?

19:19.083 --> 19:21.000
- (STOMACH GURGLING)
- (GASPS)

19:21.626 --> 19:24.042
Wow, you do have indigestion.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.542
Seriously, it sounds like

19:25.543 --> 19:27.000
The Last Days of Pompeii

19:24.083 --> 19:27.000
in there.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.501
Face it, Corinne.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.918
We're done being your puppets!

19:32.083 --> 19:33.083
JESSIE: Yeah.

19:33.667 --> 19:35.042
- This family
- may not be perfect,

19:35.083 --> 19:37.042
But we do love each other.

19:37.083 --> 19:39.042
And that's as real as it gets.

19:39.083 --> 19:40.584
Real?

19:40.626 --> 19:42.313
Reality shows

19:42.314 --> 19:44.000
are about as real

19:40.626 --> 19:44.000
as my expense report!

19:45.083 --> 19:46.959
My idiotic bosses

19:47.000 --> 19:48.814
and the knuckle-draggers

19:48.815 --> 19:50.626
who watch these shows

19:47.000 --> 19:50.626
expect drama!

19:50.667 --> 19:52.042
So, stop eating that food,

19:52.083 --> 19:53.230
and start throwing it

19:53.231 --> 19:54.375
at each other!

19:56.083 --> 19:57.834
Don't you think your bosses

19:57.835 --> 19:59.584
and the viewers

19:56.083 --> 19:59.584
might be offended

19:59.626 --> 20:01.059
- if they heard
- what you just said?

20:01.083 --> 20:02.563
What, did you get that from,

20:02.564 --> 20:04.042
"Duh Magazine"?

20:04.083 --> 20:06.000
Of course they would.

20:06.042 --> 20:07.605
But, I edit all the footage,

20:07.606 --> 20:09.167
so no one

20:06.042 --> 20:09.167
will see it, but me.

20:09.209 --> 20:10.855
I wouldn't be so sure

20:10.856 --> 20:12.500
about that. Luke, now!

20:12.542 --> 20:13.792
Ha ha!

20:14.125 --> 20:16.042
Grab that memory card!

20:16.083 --> 20:17.522
That's how we do, son!

20:17.523 --> 20:18.959
Beast! Yow!

20:20.167 --> 20:21.417
Emma!

20:21.834 --> 20:22.834
Jessie!

20:23.083 --> 20:25.042
No! Give me that!

20:25.083 --> 20:26.459
Ravi, go long!

20:26.500 --> 20:28.355
If that is a sports term,

20:28.356 --> 20:30.209
it is totally lost on me.

20:30.250 --> 20:31.647
Just run, catch this,

20:31.648 --> 20:33.042
and upload it to the Internet!

20:33.083 --> 20:35.751
CORINNE: (SHRIEKING) No!

20:35.792 --> 20:37.167
(SNARLING)

20:39.083 --> 20:40.083
Better run before

20:40.084 --> 20:41.084
Mrs. Kipling gets real...

20:41.876 --> 20:43.584
- Real hungry!
- (SNARLS)

20:44.167 --> 20:46.083
(SCREAMING)

20:47.876 --> 20:49.042
You're all fired!

20:50.083 --> 20:51.042
Good riddance!

20:51.083 --> 20:52.542
I hope we never see you again!

20:52.584 --> 20:54.083
Unless you get a network show.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.272
I'll... I'll send you

20:56.273 --> 20:57.459
my headshot!

20:59.626 --> 21:01.959
Hey, a girl's got to try.

21:03.209 --> 21:04.480
Well, at least now we can all

21:04.481 --> 21:05.751
get back to normal.

21:05.792 --> 21:07.083
(SNORING)

21:08.792 --> 21:10.500
- (CHUCKLES)
- Bertram already has.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.667
Well, you can't blame him.

21:13.709 --> 21:16.000
- He did work three whole hours
- this week.

21:18.792 --> 21:21.083
Aw, he's so cute.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.000
(STOMACH GURGLING)

21:23.292 --> 21:26.000
I think he's gonna blow! Run!

21:31.209 --> 21:33.001
Jessie, I know the reality

21:33.002 --> 21:34.792
show didn't end up helping

21:31.209 --> 21:34.792
your acting career,

21:34.834 --> 21:36.042
but look on the bright side.

21:36.083 --> 21:37.083
What would that be?

21:38.042 --> 21:39.962
- I don't know. I was hoping
- you had something.

21:42.125 --> 21:43.709
Well, it did bring us

21:43.710 --> 21:45.292
closer together as a family,

21:45.334 --> 21:46.813
and I'm glad we can finally

21:46.814 --> 21:48.292
get rid of these stupid

21:45.334 --> 21:48.292
surveillance cameras.

21:48.334 --> 21:50.188
Me too. Now we can

21:50.189 --> 21:52.042
just go back to being

21:48.334 --> 21:52.042
ordinary kids.

21:52.083 --> 21:53.876
You know,

21:53.877 --> 21:55.667
most ordinary kids don't have

21:52.083 --> 21:55.667
two private islands.

21:56.083 --> 21:57.959
That is so sad.

22:02.083 --> 22:03.563
Zuri, I said collect

22:03.564 --> 22:05.042
the cameras,

22:02.083 --> 22:05.042
not destroy them.

22:05.083 --> 22:06.563
I know.

22:06.564 --> 22:08.042
But breaking stuff is fun.

22:08.083 --> 22:09.583
On a related note,

22:09.584 --> 22:11.083
you need a new lamp

22:08.083 --> 22:11.083
for your bedroom.

22:12.751 --> 22:13.897
Jessie, come quick!

22:13.898 --> 22:15.042
Corinne is back with her

22:12.751 --> 22:15.042
camera crew!

22:15.083 --> 22:16.542
What? I'm going to do

22:16.543 --> 22:18.000
the Texas two-step on her...

22:18.083 --> 22:19.709
Hey! A party!

22:20.834 --> 22:23.334
ALL: Happy Nanniversary!

22:23.375 --> 22:25.209
Aw, guys...

22:25.210 --> 22:27.042
I don't know

22:23.375 --> 22:27.042
what to say, except...

22:27.083 --> 22:28.292
Who's "Jassie?"

22:30.667 --> 22:31.855
I'm sorry,

22:31.856 --> 22:33.042
I'm still really tired.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.938
There's a 75% chance

22:34.939 --> 22:36.792
I iced the cake with lard.

22:38.709 --> 22:41.709
Guys, thank you so much.

22:42.959 --> 22:44.605
Look, I would not trade

22:44.606 --> 22:46.250
the last two years

22:42.959 --> 22:46.250
with you all for anything.

22:47.083 --> 22:48.375
Neither would we.

22:48.417 --> 22:49.688
I'd trade all of you guys

22:49.689 --> 22:50.959
for a week in Key West.

22:52.083 --> 22:53.563
But let's have some

22:53.564 --> 22:55.042
nanniversary cake!

22:52.083 --> 22:55.042
(CHUCKLES)

22:55.083 --> 22:57.334
Aw, guys this is beautiful.

22:58.125 --> 22:59.292
Yep, lard.
